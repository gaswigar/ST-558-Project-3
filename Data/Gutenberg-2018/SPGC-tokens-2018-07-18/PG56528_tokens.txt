introduction
by
havelock
ellis
was
published
in
after
occupying
zola
during
the
previous
year
in
accordance
with
his
usual
custom
but
to
a
greater
extent
than
with
any
other
of
his
books
except
he
accumulated
material
beforehand
for
six
months
he
travelled
about
the
district
in
northern
france
and
belgium
especially
the
borinage
around
mons
in
hand
was
inquisitive
was
that
gentleman
miner
told
sherard
who
visited
the
neighbourhood
at
a
later
period
and
found
that
the
miners
in
every
village
knew
that
was
a
tribute
of
admiration
the
book
deserved
but
it
was
never
one
of
zola
most
popular
novels
it
was
neither
amusing
enough
nor
outrageous
enough
to
attract
the
multitude
yet
occupies
a
place
among
zola
works
which
is
constantly
becoming
more
assured
so
that
to
some
critics
it
even
begins
to
seem
the
only
book
of
his
that
in
the
end
may
survive
in
his
own
time
as
we
know
the
accredited
critics
of
the
day
could
find
no
condemnation
severe
enough
for
zola
brunetière
attacked
him
perpetually
with
a
fury
that
seemed
inexhaustible
schérer
could
not
even
bear
to
hear
his
name
mentioned
anatole
france
though
he
lived
to
relent
thought
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
never
been
born
even
at
that
time
however
there
were
critics
who
inclined
to
view
germinal
more
favourably
thus
faguet
who
was
the
recognized
academic
critic
of
the
end
of
the
last
century
while
he
held
that
posterity
would
be
unable
to
understand
how
zola
could
ever
have
been
popular
yet
recognized
him
as
in
germinal
the
heroic
representative
of
democracy
incomparable
in
his
power
of
describing
crowds
and
he
realized
how
marvellous
is
the
conclusion
of
this
book
when
critics
view
zola
in
the
main
with
indifference
rather
than
with
horror
although
he
still
retains
his
popular
favour
the
distinction
of
is
yet
more
clearly
recognized
seillière
while
regarding
the
capitalistic
conditions
presented
as
now
of
an
ancient
and
almost
extinct
type
yet
sees
standing
out
as
poem
of
social
mysticism
while
andré
gide
a
completely
modern
critic
who
has
left
a
deep
mark
on
the
present
generation
observes
somewhere
that
it
may
nowadays
cause
surprise
that
he
should
refer
with
admiration
to
but
it
is
a
masterly
book
that
fills
him
with
astonishment
he
can
hardly
believe
that
it
was
written
in
french
and
still
less
that
it
should
have
been
written
in
any
other
language
it
seems
that
it
should
have
been
created
in
some
international
tongue
the
high
place
thus
claimed
for
will
hardly
seem
exaggerated
the
book
was
produced
when
zola
had
at
length
achieved
the
full
mastery
of
his
art
and
before
his
hand
had
as
in
his
latest
novels
begun
to
lose
its
firm
grasp
the
subject
lent
itself
moreover
to
his
special
aptitude
for
presenting
in
vivid
outline
great
human
groups
and
to
his
special
sympathy
with
the
collective
emotions
and
social
aspirations
of
such
groups
we
do
not
as
so
often
in
zola
work
become
painfully
conscious
that
he
is
seeking
to
reproduce
aspects
of
life
with
which
he
is
imperfectly
acquainted
or
fitting
them
into
scientific
formulas
which
he
has
imperfectly
understood
he
shows
a
masterly
grip
of
each
separate
group
and
each
represents
some
essential
element
of
the
whole
they
are
harmoniously
balanced
and
their
mutual
action
and
reaction
leads
on
inevitably
to
the
splendid
tragic
dose
with
yet
its
great
promise
for
the
future
i
will
not
here
discuss
zola
literary
art
i
have
done
so
in
my
book
of
it
is
enough
to
say
that
though
he
was
not
a
great
master
of
style
zola
never
again
wrote
so
finely
as
here
a
word
may
be
added
to
explain
how
this
translation
fell
to
the
lot
of
one
whose
work
has
been
in
other
fields
in
the
late
texeira
de
mattos
was
arranging
for
private
issue
a
series
of
complete
versions
of
some
of
zola
chief
novels
and
offered
to
assign
to
me
my
time
was
taken
up
with
preliminary
but
as
yet
unfruitful
preparation
for
what
i
regarded
as
my
own
special
task
in
life
and
i
felt
that
i
must
not
neglect
the
opportunity
of
spending
my
spare
time
in
making
a
modest
addition
to
my
income
my
wife
readily
fell
into
the
project
and
agreed
on
the
understanding
that
we
shared
the
proceeds
to
act
as
my
amanuensis
so
in
the
little
cornish
cottage
over
the
sea
we
then
occupied
the
evenings
of
the
early
months
of
were
spent
over
i
translating
aloud
and
she
with
swift
efficient
untiring
pen
following
now
and
then
bettering
my
english
dialogue
with
her
pungent
wit
in
this
way
i
was
able
to
gain
a
more
minute
insight
into
the
details
of
zola
work
and
a
more
impressive
vision
of
the
massive
structure
he
here
raised
than
can
easily
be
acquired
by
the
mere
reader
that
joint
task
has
remained
an
abidingly
pleasant
memory
it
is
moreover
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
know
that
i
have
been
responsible
however
inadequately
for
the
only
complete
english
version
of
this
wonderful
book
great
fresco
as
zola
himself
called
it
a
great
prose
epic
as
it
has
seemed
to
some
worthy
to
compare
with
the
great
verse
epics
of
old
part
one
chapter
i
over
the
open
plain
beneath
a
starless
sky
as
dark
and
thick
as
ink
a
man
walked
alone
along
the
highway
from
marchiennes
to
montsou
a
straight
paved
road
ten
kilometres
in
length
intersecting
the
beetroot
fields
he
could
not
even
see
the
black
soil
before
him
and
only
felt
the
immense
flat
horizon
by
the
gusts
of
march
wind
squalls
as
strong
as
on
the
sea
and
frozen
from
sweeping
leagues
of
marsh
and
naked
earth
no
tree
could
be
seen
against
the
sky
and
the
road
unrolled
as
straight
as
a
pier
in
the
midst
of
the
blinding
spray
of
darkness
the
man
had
set
out
from
marchiennes
about
two
he
walked
with
long
strides
shivering
beneath
his
worn
cotton
jacket
and
corduroy
breeches
a
small
parcel
tied
in
a
check
handkerchief
troubled
him
much
and
he
pressed
it
against
his
side
sometimes
with
one
elbow
sometimes
with
the
other
so
that
he
could
slip
to
the
bottom
of
his
pockets
both
the
benumbed
hands
that
bled
beneath
the
lashes
of
the
wind
a
single
idea
occupied
his
head
the
empty
head
of
a
workman
without
work
and
without
lodging
the
hope
that
the
cold
would
be
less
keen
after
sunrise
for
an
hour
he
went
on
thus
when
on
the
left
two
kilometres
from
montsou
he
saw
red
flames
three
fires
burning
in
the
open
air
and
apparently
suspended
at
first
he
hesitated
half
afraid
then
he
could
not
resist
the
painful
need
to
warm
his
hands
for
a
moment
the
steep
road
led
downwards
and
everything
disappeared
the
man
saw
on
his
right
a
paling
a
wall
of
coarse
planks
shutting
in
a
line
of
rails
while
a
grassy
slope
rose
on
the
left
surmounted
by
confused
gables
a
vision
of
a
village
with
low
uniform
roofs
he
went
on
some
two
hundred
paces
suddenly
at
a
bend
in
the
road
the
fires
reappeared
close
to
him
though
he
could
not
understand
how
they
burnt
so
high
in
the
dead
sky
like
smoky
moons
but
on
the
level
soil
another
sight
had
struck
him
it
was
a
heavy
mass
a
low
pile
of
buildings
from
which
rose
the
silhouette
of
a
factory
chimney
occasional
gleams
appeared
from
dirty
windows
five
or
six
melancholy
lanterns
were
hung
outside
to
frames
of
blackened
wood
which
vaguely
outlined
the
profiles
of
gigantic
stages
and
from
this
fantastic
apparition
drowned
in
night
and
smoke
a
single
voice
arose
the
thick
long
breathing
of
a
steam
escapement
that
could
not
be
seen
then
the
man
recognized
a
pit
his
despair
returned
what
was
the
good
there
would
be
no
work
instead
of
turning
towards
the
buildings
he
decided
at
last
to
ascend
the
pit
bank
on
which
burnt
in
iron
baskets
the
three
coal
fires
which
gave
light
and
warmth
for
work
the
labourers
in
the
cutting
must
have
been
working
late
they
were
still
throwing
out
the
useless
rubbish
now
he
heard
the
landers
push
the
wagons
on
the
stages
he
could
distinguish
living
shadows
tipping
over
the
trams
or
tubs
near
each
fire
good
day
he
said
approaching
one
of
the
baskets
turning
his
back
to
the
fire
the
carman
stood
upright
he
was
an
old
man
dressed
in
knitted
violet
wool
with
a
cap
on
his
head
while
his
horse
a
great
yellow
horse
waited
with
the
immobility
of
stone
while
they
emptied
the
six
trains
he
drew
the
workman
employed
at
the
a
lean
fellow
did
not
hurry
himself
he
pressed
on
the
lever
with
a
sleepy
hand
and
above
the
wind
grew
stronger
an
icy
north
wind
and
its
great
regular
breaths
passed
by
like
the
strokes
of
a
scythe
good
day
replied
the
old
man
there
was
silence
the
man
who
felt
that
he
was
being
looked
at
suspiciously
at
once
told
his
name
i
am
called
étienne
lantier
i
am
an
any
work
here
the
flames
lit
him
up
he
might
be
about
years
of
age
a
very
dark
handsome
man
who
looked
strong
in
spite
of
his
thin
limbs
the
carman
thus
reassured
shook
his
head
work
for
an
no
no
there
were
two
came
yesterday
nothing
a
gust
cut
short
their
speech
then
étienne
asked
pointing
to
the
sombre
pile
of
buildings
at
the
foot
of
the
platform
a
pit
is
it
the
old
man
this
time
could
not
reply
he
was
strangled
by
a
violent
cough
at
last
he
expectorated
and
his
expectoration
left
a
black
patch
on
the
purple
soil
yes
a
pit
the
voreux
there
the
settlement
is
quite
near
in
his
turn
and
with
extended
arm
he
pointed
out
in
the
night
the
village
of
which
the
young
man
had
vaguely
seen
the
roofs
but
the
six
trams
were
empty
and
he
followed
them
without
cracking
his
whip
his
legs
stiffened
by
rheumatism
while
the
great
yellow
horse
went
on
of
itself
pulling
heavily
between
the
rails
beneath
a
new
gust
which
bristled
its
coat
the
voreux
was
now
emerging
from
the
gloom
étienne
who
forgot
himself
before
the
stove
warming
his
poor
bleeding
hands
looked
round
and
could
see
each
part
of
the
pit
the
shed
tarred
with
siftings
the
the
vast
chamber
of
the
winding
machine
the
square
turret
of
the
exhaustion
pump
this
pit
piled
up
in
the
bottom
of
a
hollow
with
its
squat
brick
buildings
raising
its
chimney
like
a
threatening
horn
seemed
to
him
to
have
the
evil
air
of
a
gluttonous
beast
crouching
there
to
devour
the
earth
while
examining
it
he
thought
of
himself
of
his
vagabond
existence
these
eight
days
he
had
been
seeking
work
he
saw
himself
again
at
his
workshop
at
the
railway
delivering
a
blow
at
his
foreman
driven
from
lille
driven
from
everywhere
on
saturday
he
had
arrived
at
marchiennes
where
they
said
that
work
was
to
be
had
at
the
forges
and
there
was
nothing
neither
at
the
forges
nor
at
sonneville
he
had
been
obliged
to
pass
the
sunday
hidden
beneath
the
wood
of
a
cartwright
yard
from
which
the
watchman
had
just
turned
him
out
at
two
in
the
morning
he
had
nothing
not
a
penny
not
even
a
crust
what
should
he
do
wandering
along
the
roads
without
aim
not
knowing
where
to
shelter
himself
from
the
wind
yes
it
was
certainly
a
pit
the
occasional
lanterns
lighted
up
the
square
a
door
suddenly
opened
had
enabled
him
to
catch
sight
of
the
furnaces
in
a
clear
light
he
could
explain
even
the
escapement
of
the
pump
that
thick
long
breathing
that
went
on
without
ceasing
and
which
seemed
to
be
the
monster
congested
respiration
the
workman
expanding
his
back
at
the
had
not
even
lifted
his
eyes
on
étienne
and
the
latter
was
about
to
pick
up
his
little
bundle
which
had
fallen
to
the
earth
when
a
spasm
of
coughing
announced
the
carman
return
slowly
he
emerged
from
the
darkness
followed
by
the
yellow
horse
drawing
six
more
laden
trams
are
there
factories
at
montsou
asked
the
young
man
the
old
man
expectorated
then
replied
in
the
wind
oh
it
is
factories
that
are
lacking
should
have
seen
it
three
or
four
years
ago
everything
was
roaring
then
there
were
not
men
enough
there
never
were
such
wages
and
now
they
are
tightening
their
bellies
again
nothing
but
misery
in
the
country
every
one
is
being
sent
away
workshops
closing
one
after
the
other
it
is
not
the
emperor
fault
perhaps
but
why
should
he
go
and
fight
in
america
without
counting
that
the
beasts
are
dying
from
cholera
like
the
people
then
in
short
sentences
and
with
broken
breath
the
two
continued
to
complain
étienne
narrated
his
vain
wanderings
of
the
past
week
must
one
then
die
of
hunger
soon
the
roads
would
be
full
of
beggars
yes
said
the
old
man
this
will
turn
out
badly
for
god
does
not
allow
so
many
christians
to
be
thrown
on
the
street
we
do
have
meat
every
day
but
if
one
had
bread
true
if
one
only
had
bread
their
voices
were
lost
gusts
of
wind
carrying
away
the
words
in
a
melancholy
howl
here
began
the
carman
again
very
loudly
turning
towards
the
south
montsou
is
over
there
and
stretching
out
his
hand
again
he
pointed
out
invisible
spots
in
the
darkness
as
he
named
them
below
at
montsou
the
fauvelle
sugar
works
were
still
going
but
the
hoton
sugar
works
had
just
been
dismissing
hands
there
were
only
the
dutilleul
flour
mill
and
the
bleuze
rope
walk
for
which
kept
up
then
with
a
large
gesture
he
indicated
the
north
half
of
the
horizon
the
sonneville
workshops
had
not
received
of
their
usual
orders
only
two
of
the
three
blast
furnaces
of
the
marchiennes
forges
were
alight
finally
at
the
gagebois
glass
works
a
strike
was
threatening
for
there
was
talk
of
a
reduction
of
wages
i
know
i
know
replied
the
young
man
at
each
indication
i
have
been
there
with
us
here
things
are
going
on
at
present
added
the
carman
but
the
pits
have
lowered
their
output
and
see
opposite
at
the
victoire
there
are
also
only
two
batteries
of
coke
furnaces
alight
he
expectorated
and
set
out
behind
his
sleepy
horse
after
harnessing
it
to
the
empty
trams
now
étienne
could
oversee
the
entire
country
the
darkness
remained
profound
but
the
old
man
hand
had
as
it
were
filled
it
with
great
miseries
which
the
young
man
unconsciously
felt
at
this
moment
around
him
everywhere
in
the
limitless
tract
was
it
not
a
cry
of
famine
that
the
march
wind
rolled
up
across
this
naked
plain
the
squalls
were
furious
they
seemed
to
bring
the
death
of
labour
a
famine
which
would
kill
many
men
and
with
wandering
eyes
he
tried
to
pierce
shades
tormented
at
once
by
the
desire
and
by
the
fear
of
seeing
everything
was
hidden
in
the
unknown
depths
of
the
gloomy
night
he
only
perceived
very
far
off
the
blast
furnaces
and
the
coke
ovens
the
latter
with
their
hundreds
of
chimneys
planted
obliquely
made
lines
of
red
flame
while
the
two
towers
more
to
the
left
burnt
blue
against
the
blank
sky
like
giant
torches
it
resembled
a
melancholy
conflagration
no
other
stars
rose
on
the
threatening
horizon
except
these
nocturnal
fires
in
a
land
of
coal
and
iron
you
belong
to
belgium
perhaps
began
again
the
carman
who
had
returned
behind
étienne
this
time
he
only
brought
three
trams
those
at
least
could
be
tipped
over
an
accident
which
had
happened
to
the
cage
a
broken
screw
nut
would
stop
work
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
bank
there
was
silence
the
landers
no
longer
shook
the
stages
with
a
prolonged
vibration
one
only
heard
from
the
pit
the
distant
sound
of
a
hammer
tapping
on
an
iron
plate
no
i
come
from
the
south
replied
the
young
man
the
workman
after
having
emptied
the
trams
had
seated
himself
on
the
earth
glad
of
the
accident
maintaining
his
savage
silence
he
had
simply
lifted
his
large
dim
eyes
to
the
carman
as
if
annoyed
by
so
many
words
the
latter
indeed
did
not
usually
talk
at
such
length
the
unknown
man
face
must
have
pleased
him
that
he
should
have
been
taken
by
one
of
these
itchings
for
confidence
which
sometimes
make
old
people
talk
aloud
even
when
alone
i
belong
to
montsou
he
said
i
am
called
bonnemort
is
it
a
nickname
asked
étienne
astonished
the
old
man
made
a
grimace
of
satisfaction
and
pointed
to
the
voreux
yes
yes
they
have
pulled
me
three
times
out
of
that
torn
to
pieces
once
with
all
my
hair
scorched
once
with
my
gizzard
full
of
earth
and
another
time
with
my
belly
swollen
with
water
like
a
frog
and
then
when
they
saw
that
nothing
would
kill
me
they
called
me
bonnemort
for
a
joke
his
cheerfulness
increased
like
the
creaking
of
an
pulley
and
ended
by
degenerating
into
a
terrible
spasm
of
coughing
the
fire
basket
now
clearly
lit
up
his
large
head
with
its
scanty
white
hair
and
flat
livid
face
spotted
with
bluish
patches
he
was
short
with
an
enormous
neck
projecting
calves
and
heels
and
long
arms
with
massive
hands
falling
to
his
knees
for
the
rest
like
his
horse
which
stood
immovable
without
suffering
from
the
wind
he
seemed
to
be
made
of
stone
he
had
no
appearance
of
feeling
either
the
cold
or
the
gusts
that
whistled
at
his
ears
when
he
coughed
his
throat
was
torn
by
a
deep
rasping
he
spat
at
the
foot
of
the
basket
and
the
earth
was
blackened
étienne
looked
at
him
and
at
the
ground
which
he
had
thus
stained
have
you
been
working
long
at
the
mine
bonnemort
flung
open
both
arms
long
i
should
think
so
i
was
not
eight
when
i
went
down
into
the
voreux
and
i
am
now
reckon
that
up
i
have
been
everything
down
there
at
first
trammer
then
putter
when
i
had
the
strength
to
wheel
then
pikeman
for
eighteen
years
then
because
of
my
cursed
legs
they
put
me
into
the
earth
cutting
to
bank
up
and
patch
until
they
had
to
bring
me
up
because
the
doctor
said
i
should
stay
there
for
good
then
after
five
years
of
that
they
made
me
carman
eh
that
fine
fifty
years
at
the
mine
down
below
while
he
was
speaking
fragments
of
burning
coal
which
now
and
then
fell
from
the
basket
lit
up
his
pale
face
with
their
red
reflection
they
tell
me
to
rest
he
went
on
but
i
not
going
to
i
not
such
a
fool
i
can
get
on
for
two
years
longer
to
my
sixtieth
so
as
to
get
the
pension
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
francs
if
i
wished
them
good
evening
they
would
give
me
a
hundred
and
fifty
at
once
they
are
cunning
the
beggars
besides
i
am
sound
except
my
legs
you
see
it
the
water
which
has
got
under
my
skin
through
being
always
wet
in
the
cuttings
there
are
days
when
i
ca
move
a
paw
without
screaming
a
spasm
of
coughing
interrupted
him
again
and
that
makes
you
cough
so
said
étienne
but
he
vigorously
shook
his
head
then
when
he
could
speak
no
no
i
caught
cold
a
month
ago
i
never
used
to
cough
now
i
get
rid
of
it
and
the
queer
thing
is
that
i
spit
that
i
spit
the
rasping
was
again
heard
in
his
throat
followed
by
the
black
expectoration
is
it
blood
asked
étienne
at
last
venturing
to
question
him
bonnemort
slowly
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
it
coal
i
got
enough
in
my
carcass
to
warm
me
till
i
die
and
it
five
years
since
i
put
a
foot
down
below
i
stored
it
up
it
seems
without
knowing
it
it
keeps
you
alive
there
was
silence
the
distant
hammer
struck
regular
blows
in
the
pit
and
the
wind
passed
by
with
its
moan
like
a
cry
of
hunger
and
weariness
coming
out
of
the
depths
of
the
night
before
the
flames
which
grew
low
the
old
man
went
on
in
lower
tones
chewing
over
again
his
old
recollections
ah
certainly
it
was
not
yesterday
that
he
and
his
began
hammering
at
the
seam
the
family
had
worked
for
the
montsou
mining
company
since
it
started
and
that
was
long
ago
a
hundred
and
six
years
already
his
grandfather
guillaume
maheu
an
urchin
of
fifteen
then
had
found
the
rich
coal
at
réquillart
the
first
pit
an
old
abandoned
pit
down
below
near
the
fauvelle
sugar
works
all
the
country
knew
it
and
as
a
proof
the
discovered
seam
was
called
the
guillaume
after
his
grandfather
he
had
not
known
him
a
big
fellow
it
was
said
very
strong
who
died
of
old
age
at
sixty
then
his
father
nicolas
maheu
called
le
rouge
when
hardly
forty
years
of
age
had
died
in
the
pit
which
was
being
excavated
at
that
time
a
landslip
a
complete
slide
and
the
rock
drank
his
blood
and
swallowed
his
bones
two
of
his
uncles
and
his
three
brothers
later
on
also
left
their
skins
there
he
vincent
maheu
who
had
come
out
almost
whole
except
that
his
legs
were
rather
shaky
was
looked
upon
as
a
knowing
fellow
but
what
could
one
do
one
must
work
one
worked
here
from
father
to
son
as
one
would
work
at
anything
else
his
son
toussaint
maheu
was
being
worked
to
death
there
now
and
his
grandsons
and
all
his
people
who
lived
opposite
in
the
settlement
a
hundred
and
six
years
of
mining
the
youngsters
after
the
old
ones
for
the
same
master
eh
there
were
many
bourgeois
that
could
not
give
their
history
so
well
anyhow
when
one
has
got
enough
to
eat
murmured
étienne
again
that
is
what
i
say
as
long
as
one
has
bread
to
eat
one
can
live
bonnemort
was
silent
and
his
eyes
turned
towards
the
settlement
where
lights
were
appearing
one
by
one
four
struck
in
the
montsou
tower
and
the
cold
became
keener
and
is
your
company
rich
asked
étienne
the
old
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
then
let
them
fall
as
if
overwhelmed
beneath
an
avalanche
of
gold
ah
yes
ah
yes
not
perhaps
so
rich
as
its
neighbour
the
anzin
company
but
millions
and
millions
all
the
same
they
ca
count
it
nineteen
pits
thirteen
at
work
the
voreux
the
victoire
crévecoeur
mirou
thomas
madeleine
and
still
more
and
six
for
pumping
or
ventilation
like
réquillart
ten
thousand
workers
concessions
reaching
over
communes
an
output
of
five
thousand
tons
a
day
a
railway
joining
all
the
pits
and
workshops
and
factories
ah
yes
ah
yes
there
money
there
the
rolling
of
trams
on
the
stages
made
the
big
yellow
horse
prick
his
ears
the
cage
was
evidently
repaired
below
and
the
landers
had
got
to
work
again
while
he
was
harnessing
his
beast
to
the
carman
added
gently
addressing
himself
to
the
horse
wo
do
to
chatter
lazy
if
monsieur
hennebeau
knew
how
you
waste
your
time
étienne
looked
thoughtfully
into
the
night
he
asked
then
monsieur
hennebeau
owns
the
mine
no
explained
the
old
man
monsieur
hennebeau
is
only
the
general
manager
he
is
paid
just
the
same
as
us
with
a
gesture
the
young
man
pointed
into
the
darkness
who
does
it
all
belong
to
then
but
bonnemort
was
for
a
moment
so
suffocated
by
a
new
and
violent
spasm
that
he
could
not
get
his
breath
then
when
he
had
expectorated
and
wiped
the
black
froth
from
his
lips
he
replied
in
the
rising
wind
eh
all
that
belong
to
nobody
knows
to
people
and
with
his
hand
he
pointed
in
the
darkness
to
a
vague
spot
an
unknown
and
remote
place
inhabited
by
those
people
for
whom
the
maheus
had
been
hammering
at
the
seam
for
more
than
a
century
his
voice
assumed
a
tone
of
religious
awe
it
was
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
an
inaccessible
tabernacle
containing
a
sated
and
crouching
god
to
whom
they
had
given
all
their
flesh
and
whom
they
had
never
seen
at
all
events
if
one
can
get
enough
bread
to
eat
repeated
étienne
for
the
third
time
without
any
apparent
transition
indeed
yes
if
we
could
always
get
bread
it
would
be
too
good
the
horse
had
started
the
carman
in
his
turn
disappeared
with
the
trailing
step
of
an
invalid
near
the
the
workman
had
not
stirred
gathered
up
in
a
ball
burying
his
chin
between
his
knees
with
his
great
dim
eyes
fixed
on
emptiness
when
he
had
picked
up
his
bundle
étienne
still
remained
at
the
same
spot
he
felt
the
gusts
freezing
his
back
while
his
chest
was
burning
before
the
large
fire
perhaps
all
the
same
it
would
be
as
well
to
inquire
at
the
pit
the
old
man
might
not
know
then
he
resigned
himself
he
would
accept
any
work
where
should
he
go
and
what
was
to
become
of
him
in
this
country
famished
for
lack
of
work
must
he
leave
his
carcass
behind
a
wall
like
a
strayed
dog
but
one
doubt
troubled
him
a
fear
of
the
voreux
in
the
middle
of
this
flat
plain
drowned
in
so
thick
a
night
at
every
gust
the
wind
seemed
to
rise
as
if
it
blew
from
an
horizon
no
dawn
whitened
the
dead
sky
the
blast
furnaces
alone
flamed
and
the
coke
ovens
making
the
darkness
redder
without
illuminating
the
unknown
and
the
voreux
at
the
bottom
of
its
hole
with
its
posture
as
of
an
evil
beast
continued
to
crunch
breathing
with
a
heavier
and
slower
respiration
troubled
by
its
painful
digestion
of
human
flesh
chapter
ii
in
the
middle
of
the
fields
of
wheat
and
beetroot
the
settlement
slept
beneath
the
black
night
one
could
vaguely
distinguish
four
immense
blocks
of
small
houses
back
to
back
barracks
or
hospital
blocks
geometric
and
parallel
separated
by
three
large
avenues
which
were
divided
into
gardens
of
equal
size
and
over
the
desert
plain
one
heard
only
the
moan
of
squalls
through
the
broken
trellises
of
the
enclosures
in
the
maheus
house
no
in
the
second
block
nothing
was
stirring
the
single
room
that
occupied
the
first
floor
was
drowned
in
a
thick
darkness
which
seemed
to
overwhelm
with
its
weight
the
sleep
of
the
beings
whom
one
felt
to
be
there
in
a
mass
with
open
mouths
overcome
by
weariness
in
spite
of
the
keen
cold
outside
there
was
a
living
heat
in
the
heavy
air
that
hot
stuffiness
of
even
the
best
kept
bedrooms
the
smell
of
human
cattle
four
had
struck
from
the
clock
in
the
room
on
the
ground
floor
but
nothing
yet
stirred
one
heard
the
piping
of
slender
respirations
accompanied
by
two
series
of
sonorous
snores
and
suddenly
catherine
got
up
in
her
weariness
she
had
as
usual
counted
the
four
strokes
through
the
floor
without
the
strength
to
arouse
herself
completely
then
throwing
her
legs
from
under
the
bedclothes
she
felt
about
at
last
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
candle
but
she
remained
seated
her
head
so
heavy
that
it
fell
back
between
her
shoulders
seeking
to
return
to
the
bolster
now
the
candle
lighted
up
the
room
a
square
room
with
two
windows
and
filled
with
three
beds
there
could
be
seen
a
cupboard
a
table
and
two
old
walnut
chairs
whose
smoky
tone
made
hard
dark
patches
against
the
walls
which
were
painted
a
light
yellow
and
nothing
else
only
clothes
hung
to
nails
a
jug
placed
on
the
floor
and
a
red
pan
which
served
as
a
basin
in
the
bed
on
the
left
zacharie
the
eldest
a
youth
of
was
asleep
with
his
brother
jeanlin
who
had
completed
his
eleventh
year
in
the
bed
two
urchins
lénore
and
henri
the
first
six
years
old
the
second
four
slept
in
each
other
arms
while
catherine
shared
the
third
bed
with
her
sister
alzire
so
small
for
her
nine
years
that
catherine
would
not
have
felt
her
near
her
if
it
were
not
for
the
little
invalid
humpback
which
pressed
into
her
side
the
glass
door
was
open
one
could
perceive
the
lobby
of
a
landing
a
sort
of
recess
in
which
the
father
and
the
mother
occupied
a
fourth
bed
against
which
they
had
been
obliged
to
install
the
cradle
of
the
latest
comer
estelle
aged
scarcely
three
months
however
catherine
made
a
desperate
effort
she
stretched
herself
she
fidgeted
her
two
hands
in
the
red
hair
which
covered
her
forehead
and
neck
slender
for
her
fifteen
years
all
that
showed
of
her
limbs
outside
the
narrow
sheath
of
her
chemise
were
her
bluish
feet
as
it
were
tattooed
with
coal
and
her
slight
arms
the
milky
whiteness
of
which
contrasted
with
the
sallow
tint
of
her
face
already
spoilt
by
constant
washing
with
black
soap
a
final
yawn
opened
her
rather
large
mouth
with
splendid
teeth
against
the
chlorotic
pallor
of
her
gums
while
her
grey
eyes
were
crying
in
her
fight
with
sleep
with
a
look
of
painful
distress
and
weariness
which
seemed
to
spread
over
the
whole
of
her
naked
body
but
a
growl
came
from
the
landing
and
maheu
thick
voice
stammered
devil
take
it
it
time
is
it
you
lighting
up
catherine
yes
father
it
has
just
struck
downstairs
quick
then
lazy
if
you
had
danced
less
on
sunday
you
would
have
woke
us
earlier
a
fine
lazy
life
and
he
went
on
grumbling
but
sleep
returned
to
him
also
his
reproaches
became
confused
and
were
extinguished
in
fresh
snoring
the
young
girl
in
her
chemise
with
her
naked
feet
on
the
floor
moved
about
in
the
room
as
she
passed
by
the
bed
of
henri
and
lénore
she
replaced
the
coverlet
which
had
slipped
down
they
did
not
wake
lost
in
the
strong
sleep
of
childhood
alzire
with
open
eyes
had
turned
to
take
the
warm
place
of
her
big
sister
without
speaking
i
say
now
zacharie
and
you
jeanlin
i
say
now
repeated
catherine
standing
before
her
two
brothers
who
were
still
wallowing
with
their
noses
in
the
bolster
she
had
to
seize
the
elder
by
the
shoulder
and
shake
him
then
while
he
was
muttering
abuse
it
came
into
her
head
to
uncover
them
by
snatching
away
the
sheet
that
seemed
funny
to
her
and
she
began
to
laugh
when
she
saw
the
two
boys
struggling
with
naked
legs
stupid
leave
me
alone
growled
zacharie
in
sitting
up
i
do
like
tricks
good
lord
say
it
time
to
get
up
he
was
lean
and
with
a
long
face
and
a
chin
which
showed
signs
of
a
sprouting
beard
yellow
hair
and
the
anaemic
pallor
which
belonged
to
his
whole
family
his
shirt
had
rolled
up
to
his
belly
and
he
lowered
it
not
from
modesty
but
because
he
was
not
warm
it
has
struck
downstairs
repeated
catherine
come
up
angry
jeanlin
who
had
rolled
himself
up
closed
his
eyes
saying
go
and
hang
yourself
i
going
to
sleep
she
laughed
again
the
laugh
of
a
girl
he
was
so
small
his
limbs
so
thin
with
enormous
joints
enlarged
by
scrofula
that
she
took
him
up
in
her
arms
but
he
kicked
about
his
apish
face
pale
and
wrinkled
with
its
green
eyes
and
great
ears
grew
pale
with
the
rage
of
weakness
he
said
nothing
he
bit
her
right
breast
beastly
fellow
she
murmured
keeping
back
a
cry
and
putting
him
on
the
floor
alzire
was
silent
with
the
sheet
tucked
under
her
chin
but
she
had
not
gone
to
sleep
again
with
her
intelligent
invalid
eyes
she
followed
her
sister
and
her
two
brothers
who
were
now
dressing
another
quarrel
broke
out
around
the
pan
the
boys
hustled
the
young
girl
because
she
was
so
long
washing
herself
shirts
flew
about
and
while
still
they
eased
themselves
without
shame
with
the
tranquil
satisfaction
of
a
litter
of
puppies
that
have
grown
up
together
catherine
was
ready
first
she
put
on
her
miner
breeches
then
her
canvas
jacket
and
fastened
the
blue
cap
on
her
knotted
hair
in
these
clean
monday
clothes
she
had
the
appearance
of
a
little
man
nothing
remained
to
indicate
her
sex
except
the
slight
roll
of
her
hips
when
the
old
man
comes
back
said
zacharie
mischievously
like
to
find
the
bed
unmade
you
know
i
shall
tell
him
it
you
the
old
man
was
the
grandfather
bonnemort
who
as
he
worked
during
the
night
slept
by
day
so
that
the
bed
was
never
cold
there
was
always
someone
snoring
there
without
replying
catherine
set
herself
to
arrange
the
and
tuck
them
in
but
during
the
last
moments
sounds
had
been
heard
behind
the
wall
in
the
next
house
these
brick
buildings
economically
put
up
by
the
company
were
so
thin
that
the
least
breath
could
be
heard
through
them
the
inmates
lived
there
elbow
to
elbow
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
no
fact
of
family
life
remained
hidden
even
from
the
youngsters
a
heavy
step
had
tramped
up
the
staircase
then
there
was
a
kind
of
soft
fall
followed
by
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
good
said
catherine
levaque
has
gone
down
and
here
is
bouteloup
come
to
join
the
levaque
woman
jeanlin
grinned
even
alzire
eyes
shone
every
morning
they
made
fun
of
the
household
of
three
next
door
a
pikeman
who
lodged
a
worker
in
the
cutting
an
arrangement
which
gave
the
woman
two
men
one
by
night
the
other
by
day
philoméne
is
coughing
began
catherine
again
after
listening
she
was
speaking
of
the
eldest
levaque
a
big
girl
of
nineteen
and
the
mistress
of
zacharie
by
whom
she
had
already
had
two
children
her
chest
was
so
delicate
that
she
was
only
a
sifter
at
the
pit
never
having
been
able
to
work
below
pooh
philoméne
replied
zacharie
she
cares
a
lot
she
asleep
it
hoggish
to
sleep
till
six
he
was
putting
on
his
breeches
when
an
idea
occurred
to
him
and
he
opened
the
window
outside
in
the
darkness
the
settlement
was
awaking
lights
were
dawning
one
by
one
between
the
laths
of
the
shutters
and
there
was
another
dispute
he
leant
out
to
watch
if
he
could
not
see
coming
out
of
pierron
opposite
the
captain
of
the
voreux
who
was
accused
of
sleeping
with
the
pierron
woman
while
his
sister
called
to
him
that
since
the
day
before
the
husband
had
taken
day
duty
at
the
and
that
certainly
dansaert
could
not
have
slept
there
that
night
whilst
the
air
entered
in
icy
whiffs
both
of
them
becoming
angry
maintained
the
truth
of
their
own
information
until
cries
and
tears
broke
out
it
was
estelle
in
her
cradle
vexed
by
the
cold
maheu
woke
up
suddenly
what
had
he
got
in
his
bones
then
here
he
was
going
to
sleep
again
like
a
and
he
swore
so
vigorously
that
the
children
became
still
zacharie
and
jeanlin
finished
washing
with
slow
weariness
alzire
with
her
large
open
eyes
continually
stared
the
two
youngsters
lénore
and
henri
in
each
other
arms
had
not
stirred
breathing
in
the
same
quiet
way
in
spite
of
the
noise
catherine
give
me
the
candle
called
out
maheu
she
finished
buttoning
her
jacket
and
carried
the
candle
into
the
closet
leaving
her
brothers
to
look
for
their
clothes
by
what
light
came
through
the
door
her
father
jumped
out
of
bed
she
did
not
stop
but
went
downstairs
in
her
coarse
woollen
stockings
feeling
her
way
and
lighted
another
candle
in
the
parlour
to
prepare
the
coffee
all
the
sabots
of
the
family
were
beneath
the
sideboard
will
you
be
still
vermin
began
maheu
again
exasperated
by
estelle
cries
which
still
went
on
he
was
short
like
old
bonnemort
and
resembled
him
with
his
strong
head
his
flat
livid
face
beneath
yellow
hair
cut
very
short
the
child
screamed
more
than
ever
frightened
by
those
great
knotted
arms
which
were
held
above
her
leave
her
alone
you
know
that
she
wo
be
still
said
his
wife
stretching
herself
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
she
also
had
just
awakened
and
was
complaining
how
disgusting
it
was
never
to
be
able
to
finish
the
night
could
they
not
go
away
quietly
buried
in
the
clothes
she
only
showed
her
long
face
with
large
features
of
a
heavy
beauty
already
disfigured
at
by
her
life
of
wretchedness
and
the
seven
children
she
had
borne
with
her
eyes
on
the
ceiling
she
spoke
slowly
while
her
man
dressed
himself
they
both
ceased
to
hear
the
little
one
who
was
strangling
herself
with
screaming
eh

know
i

a
penny

is

you
know
he
did
not
reply
being
occupied
in
looking
on
the
ground
for
his
leather
belt
then
he
said
on
getting

same

before
yesterday
that
wo
prevent
me
from
going
to
see
him
again
but
if
he
goes
on
refusing
and
maheude
continued
in
her
melancholy
voice
without
moving
her
head
only
closing
her
eyes
now
and
then
beneath
the
dim
light
of
the
candle
she
said
the
cupboard
was
empty
the
little
ones
asking
for
bread
and
butter
even
the
coffee
was
done
and
the
water
caused
colic
and
the
long
days
passed
in
deceiving
hunger
with
boiled
cabbage
leaves
little
by
little
she
had
been
obliged
to
raise
her
voice
for
screams
drowned
her
words
these
cries
became
unbearable
maheu
seemed
all
at
once
to
hear
them
and
in
a
fury
snatched
the
little
one
up
from
the
cradle
and
threw
it
on
the
mother
bed
stammering
with
rage
here
take
her
i
do
for
her
damn
the
child
it
wants
for
nothing
it
sucks
and
it
complains
louder
than
all
the
rest
estelle
began
in
fact
to
suck
hidden
beneath
the
clothes
and
soothed
by
the
warmth
of
the
bed
her
cries
subsided
into
the
greedy
little
sound
of
her
lips
have
the
piolaine
people
told
you
to
go
and
see
them
asked
the
father
after
a
period
of
silence
the
mother
bit
her
lip
with
an
air
of
discouraged
doubt
yes
they
met
me
they
were
carrying
clothes
for
poor
children
yes
i
take
lénore
and
henri
to
them
this
morning
if
they
only
give
me
a
few
pence
there
was
silence
again
maheu
was
ready
he
remained
a
moment
motionless
then
added
in
his
hollow
voice
what
is
it
that
you
want
let
things
be
and
see
about
the
soup
no
good
talking
better
be
at
work
down
below
true
enough
replied
maheude
blow
out
the
candle
i
do
need
to
see
the
colour
of
my
thoughts
he
blew
out
the
candle
zacharie
and
jeanlin
were
already
going
down
he
followed
them
and
the
wooden
staircase
creaked
beneath
their
heavy
feet
clad
in
wool
behind
them
the
closet
and
the
room
were
again
dark
the
children
slept
even
alzire
eyelids
were
closed
but
the
mother
now
remained
with
her
eyes
open
in
the
darkness
while
pulling
at
her
breast
the
pendent
breast
of
an
exhausted
woman
estelle
was
purring
like
a
kitten
down
below
catherine
had
at
first
occupied
herself
with
the
fire
which
was
burning
in
the
iron
grate
flanked
by
two
ovens
the
company
distributed
every
month
to
each
family
eight
hectolitres
of
a
hard
slaty
coal
gathered
in
the
passages
it
burnt
slowly
and
the
young
girl
who
piled
up
the
fire
every
night
only
had
to
stir
it
in
the
morning
adding
a
few
fragments
of
soft
coal
carefully
picked
out
then
after
having
placed
a
kettle
on
the
grate
she
sat
down
before
the
sideboard
it
was
a
fairly
large
room
occupying
all
the
ground
floor
painted
an
apple
green
and
of
flemish
cleanliness
with
its
flags
well
washed
and
covered
with
white
sand
besides
the
sideboard
of
varnished
deal
the
furniture
consisted
of
a
table
and
chairs
of
the
same
wood
stuck
on
to
the
walls
were
some
prints
portraits
of
the
emperor
and
the
empress
given
by
the
company
of
soldiers
and
of
saints
speckled
with
gold
contrasting
crudely
with
the
simple
nudity
of
the
room
and
there
was
no
other
ornament
except
a
box
of
pasteboard
on
the
sideboard
and
the
clock
with
its
daubed
face
and
loud
which
seemed
to
fill
the
emptiness
of
the
place
near
the
staircase
door
another
door
led
to
the
cellar
in
spite
of
the
cleanliness
an
odour
of
cooked
onion
shut
up
since
the
night
before
poisoned
the
hot
heavy
air
always
laden
with
an
acrid
flavour
of
coal
catherine
in
front
of
the
sideboard
was
reflecting
there
only
remained
the
end
of
a
loaf
cheese
in
fair
abundance
but
hardly
a
morsel
of
butter
and
she
had
to
provide
bread
and
butter
for
four
at
last
she
decided
cut
the
slices
took
one
and
covered
it
with
cheese
spread
another
with
butter
and
stuck
them
together
that
was
the
brick
the
sandwich
taken
to
the
pit
every
morning
the
four
bricks
were
soon
on
the
table
in
a
row
cut
with
severe
justice
from
the
big
one
for
the
father
down
to
the
little
one
for
jeanlin
catherine
who
appeared
absorbed
in
her
household
duties
must
however
have
been
thinking
of
the
stories
told
by
zacharie
about
the
head
captain
and
the
pierron
woman
for
she
half
opened
the
front
door
and
glanced
outside
the
wind
was
still
whistling
there
were
numerous
spots
of
light
on
the
low
fronts
of
the
settlement
from
which
arose
a
vague
tremor
of
awakening
already
doors
were
being
closed
and
black
files
of
workers
passed
into
the
night
it
was
stupid
of
her
to
get
cold
since
the
porter
at
the
was
certainly
asleep
waiting
to
take
his
duties
at
six
yet
she
remained
and
looked
at
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
gardens
the
door
opened
and
her
curiosity
was
aroused
but
it
could
only
be
one
of
the
little
pierrons
lydie
setting
out
for
the
pit
the
hissing
sound
of
steam
made
her
turn
she
shut
the
door
and
hastened
back
the
water
was
boiling
over
and
putting
out
the
fire
there
was
no
more
coffee
she
had
to
be
content
to
add
the
water
to
last
night
dregs
then
she
sugared
the
with
brown
sugar
at
that
moment
her
father
and
two
brothers
came
downstairs
faith
exclaimed
zacharie
when
he
had
put
his
nose
into
his
bowl
here
something
that
wo
get
into
our
heads
maheu
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
resignation
bah
it
hot
it
good
all
the
same
jeanlin
had
gathered
up
the
fragments
of
bread
and
made
a
sop
of
them
after
having
drunk
catherine
finished
by
emptying
the
into
the
all
four
standing
up
in
the
smoky
light
of
the
candle
swallowed
their
meals
hastily
are
we
at
the
end
said
the
father
one
would
say
we
were
people
of
property
but
a
voice
came
from
the
staircase
of
which
they
had
left
the
door
open
it
was
maheude
who
called
out
take
all
the
bread
i
have
some
vermicelli
for
the
children
yes
yes
replied
catherine
she
had
piled
up
the
fire
wedging
the
pot
that
held
the
remains
of
the
soup
into
a
corner
of
the
grate
so
that
the
grandfather
might
find
it
warm
when
he
came
in
at
six
each
took
his
sabots
from
under
the
sideboard
passed
the
strings
of
his
tin
over
his
shoulder
and
placed
his
brick
at
his
back
between
shirt
and
jacket
and
they
went
out
the
men
first
the
girl
who
came
last
blowing
out
the
candle
and
turning
the
key
the
house
became
dark
again
ah
we
off
together
said
a
man
who
was
closing
the
door
of
the
next
house
it
was
levaque
with
his
son
bébert
an
urchin
of
twelve
a
great
friend
of
jeanlin
catherine
in
surprise
stifled
a
laugh
in
zacharie
ear
why
bouteloup
did
even
wait
until
the
husband
had
gone
now
the
lights
in
the
settlement
were
extinguished
and
the
last
door
banged
all
again
fell
asleep
the
women
and
the
little
ones
resuming
their
slumber
in
the
midst
of
wider
beds
and
from
the
extinguished
village
to
the
roaring
voreux
a
slow
filing
of
shadows
took
place
beneath
the
squalls
the
departure
of
the
colliers
to
their
work
bending
their
shoulders
and
incommoded
by
their
arms
crossed
on
their
breasts
while
the
brick
behind
formed
a
hump
on
each
back
clothed
in
their
thin
jackets
they
shivered
with
cold
but
without
hastening
straggling
along
the
road
with
the
tramp
of
a
flock
chapter
iii
étienne
had
at
last
descended
from
the
platform
and
entered
the
voreux
he
spoke
to
men
whom
he
met
asking
if
there
was
work
to
be
had
but
all
shook
their
heads
telling
him
to
wait
for
the
captain
they
left
him
free
to
roam
through
the
buildings
full
of
black
holes
confusing
with
their
complicated
stories
and
rooms
after
having
mounted
a
dark
and
staircase
he
found
himself
on
a
shaky
then
he
crossed
the
which
was
plunged
in
such
profound
darkness
that
he
walked
with
his
hands
before
him
for
protection
suddenly
two
enormous
yellow
eyes
pierced
the
darkness
in
front
of
him
he
was
beneath
the
in
the
at
the
very
mouth
of
the
shaft
a
captain
father
richomme
a
big
man
with
the
face
of
a
gendarme
and
with
a
straight
grey
moustache
was
at
that
moment
going
towards
the
receiver
office
do
they
want
a
hand
here
for
any
kind
of
work
asked
étienne
again
richomme
was
about
to
say
no
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
replied
like
the
others
as
he
went
away
wait
for
monsieur
dansaert
the
head
captain
four
lanterns
were
placed
there
and
the
reflectors
which
threw
all
the
light
on
to
the
shaft
vividly
illuminated
the
iron
rail
the
levers
of
the
signals
and
bars
the
joists
of
the
guides
along
which
slid
the
two
cages
the
rest
of
the
vast
room
like
the
nave
of
a
church
was
obscure
and
peopled
by
great
floating
shadows
only
the
shone
at
the
far
end
while
in
the
receiver
office
a
small
lamp
looked
like
a
fading
star
work
was
about
to
be
resumed
and
on
the
iron
pavement
there
was
a
continual
thunder
trams
of
coal
being
wheeled
without
ceasing
while
the
landers
with
their
long
bent
backs
could
be
distinguished
amid
the
movement
of
all
these
black
and
noisy
things
in
perpetual
agitation
for
a
moment
étienne
stood
motionless
deafened
and
blinded
he
felt
frozen
by
the
currents
of
air
which
entered
from
every
side
then
he
moved
on
a
few
paces
attracted
by
the
winding
engine
of
which
he
could
now
see
the
glistening
steel
and
copper
it
was
metres
beyond
the
shaft
in
a
loftier
chamber
and
placed
so
solidly
on
its
brick
foundation
that
though
it
worked
at
full
speed
with
all
its
four
hundred
horse
power
the
movement
of
its
enormous
crank
emerging
and
plunging
with
oily
softness
imparted
no
quiver
to
the
walls
the
standing
at
his
post
listened
to
the
ringing
of
the
signals
and
his
eye
never
moved
from
the
indicator
where
the
shaft
was
figured
with
its
different
levels
by
a
vertical
groove
traversed
by
shot
hanging
to
strings
which
represented
the
cages
and
at
each
departure
when
the
machine
was
put
in
motion
the
drums
two
immense
wheels
five
metres
in
radius
by
means
of
which
the
two
steel
cables
were
rolled
and
unrolled
turned
with
such
rapidity
that
they
became
like
grey
powder
look
out
there
cried
three
landers
who
were
dragging
an
immense
ladder
étienne
just
escaped
being
crushed
his
eyes
were
soon
more
at
home
and
he
watched
the
cables
moving
in
the
air
more
than
thirty
metres
of
steel
ribbon
which
flew
up
into
the
where
they
passed
over
pulleys
to
descend
perpendicularly
into
the
shaft
where
they
were
attached
to
the
cages
an
iron
frame
like
the
high
scaffolding
of
a
belfry
supported
the
pulleys
it
was
like
the
gliding
of
a
bird
noiseless
without
a
jar
this
rapid
flight
the
continual
come
and
go
of
a
thread
of
enormous
weight
capable
of
lifting
twelve
thousand
kilograms
at
the
rate
of
ten
metres
a
second
attention
there
for
god
sake
cried
again
the
landers
pushing
the
ladder
to
the
other
side
in
order
to
climb
to
the
rowel
slowly
étienne
returned
to
the
this
giant
flight
over
his
head
took
away
his
breath
shivering
in
the
currents
of
air
he
watched
the
movement
of
the
cages
his
ears
deafened
by
the
rumblings
of
the
trams
near
the
shaft
the
signal
was
working
a
hammer
drawn
by
a
cord
from
below
and
allowed
to
strike
against
a
block
one
blow
to
stop
two
to
go
down
three
to
go
up
it
was
unceasing
like
blows
of
a
club
dominating
the
tumult
accompanied
by
the
clear
sound
of
the
bell
while
the
lander
directing
the
work
increased
the
noise
still
more
by
shouting
orders
to
the
through
a
trumpet
the
cages
in
the
middle
of
the
clear
space
appeared
and
disappeared
were
filled
and
emptied
without
étienne
being
at
all
able
to
understand
the
complicated
proceeding
he
only
understood
one
thing
well
the
shaft
swallowed
men
by
mouthfuls
of
twenty
or
thirty
and
with
so
easy
a
gulp
that
it
seemed
to
feel
nothing
go
down
since
four
the
descent
of
the
workmen
had
been
going
on
they
came
to
the
shed
with
naked
feet
and
their
lamps
in
their
hands
waiting
in
little
groups
until
a
sufficient
number
had
arrived
without
a
sound
with
the
soft
bound
of
a
nocturnal
beast
the
iron
cage
arose
from
the
night
wedged
itself
on
the
bolts
with
its
four
decks
each
containing
two
trams
full
of
coal
landers
on
different
platforms
took
out
the
trams
and
replaced
them
by
others
either
empty
or
already
laden
with
trimmed
wooden
props
and
it
was
into
the
empty
trams
that
the
workmen
crowded
five
at
a
time
up
to
forty
when
they
filled
all
the
compartments
an
order
came
from
the
trumpet
a
hollow
indistinct
roar
while
the
signal
cord
was
pulled
four
times
from
below
ringing
meat
to
give
warning
of
this
burden
of
human
flesh
then
after
a
slight
leap
the
cage
plunged
silently
falling
like
a
stone
only
leaving
behind
it
the
vibrating
flight
of
a
cable
is
it
deep
asked
étienne
of
a
miner
who
waited
near
him
with
a
sleepy
air
five
hundred
and
metres
replied
the
man
but
there
are
four
levels
the
first
at
three
hundred
and
twenty
both
were
silent
with
their
eyes
on
the
returning
cable
étienne
said
again
and
if
it
breaks
ah
if
it
breaks
the
miner
ended
with
a
gesture
his
turn
had
arrived
the
cage
had
reappeared
with
its
easy
unfatigued
movement
he
squatted
in
it
with
some
comrades
it
plunged
down
then
flew
up
again
in
less
then
four
minutes
to
swallow
down
another
load
of
men
for
half
an
hour
the
shaft
went
on
devouring
in
this
fashion
with
more
or
less
greedy
gulps
according
to
the
depth
of
the
level
to
which
the
men
went
down
but
without
stopping
always
hungry
with
its
giant
intestines
capable
of
digesting
a
nation
it
went
on
filling
and
still
filling
and
the
darkness
remained
dead
the
cage
mounted
from
the
void
with
the
same
voracious
silence
étienne
was
at
last
seized
again
by
the
same
depression
which
he
had
experienced
on
the
pit
bank
what
was
the
good
of
persisting
this
head
captain
would
send
him
off
like
the
others
a
vague
fear
suddenly
decided
him
he
went
away
only
stopping
before
the
building
of
the
engine
room
the
door
showed
seven
boilers
with
two
furnaces
in
the
midst
of
the
white
steam
and
the
whistling
of
the
escapes
a
stoker
was
occupied
in
piling
up
one
of
the
furnaces
the
heat
of
which
could
be
felt
as
far
as
the
threshold
and
the
young
man
was
approaching
glad
of
the
warmth
when
he
met
a
new
band
of
colliers
who
had
just
arrived
at
the
pit
it
was
the
maheu
and
levaque
set
when
he
saw
catherine
at
the
head
with
her
gentle
boyish
air
a
superstitious
idea
caused
him
to
risk
another
question
i
say
there
mate
do
they
want
a
hand
here
for
any
kind
of
work
she
looked
at
him
surprised
rather
frightened
at
this
sudden
voice
coming
out
of
the
shadow
but
maheu
behind
her
had
heard
and
replied
talking
with
étienne
for
a
moment
no
no
one
was
wanted
this
poor
devil
of
a
man
who
had
lost
his
way
here
interested
him
when
he
left
him
he
said
to
the
others
eh
one
might
easily
be
like
that
must
complain
every
one
the
chance
to
work
himself
to
death
the
band
entered
and
went
straight
to
the
shed
a
vast
hall
roughly
boarded
and
surrounded
by
cupboards
shut
by
padlocks
in
the
centre
an
iron
fireplace
a
sort
of
closed
stove
without
a
door
glowed
red
and
was
so
stuffed
with
burning
coal
that
fragments
flew
out
and
rolled
on
to
the
trodden
soil
the
hall
was
only
lighted
by
this
stove
from
which
sanguine
reflections
danced
along
the
greasy
woodwork
up
to
the
ceiling
stained
with
black
dust
as
the
maheus
went
into
the
heat
there
was
a
sound
of
laughter
some
thirty
workmen
were
standing
upright
with
their
backs
to
the
fire
roasting
themselves
with
an
air
of
enjoyment
before
going
down
they
all
came
here
to
get
a
little
warmth
in
their
skins
so
that
they
could
face
the
dampness
of
the
pit
but
this
morning
there
was
much
amusement
they
were
joking
mouquette
a
putter
girl
of
eighteen
whose
enormous
breasts
and
flanks
were
bursting
through
her
old
jacket
and
breeches
she
lived
at
réquillart
with
her
father
old
mouque
a
groom
and
mouquet
her
brother
a
lander
but
their
hours
of
work
were
not
the
same
she
went
to
the
pit
by
herself
and
in
the
middle
of
the
wheatfields
in
summer
or
against
a
wall
in
winter
she
took
her
pleasure
with
her
lover
of
the
week
all
in
the
mine
had
their
turn
it
was
a
perpetual
round
of
comrades
without
further
consequences
one
day
when
reproached
about
a
marchiennes
she
was
furiously
angry
exclaiming
that
she
respected
herself
far
too
much
that
she
would
cut
her
arm
off
if
any
one
could
boast
that
he
had
seen
her
with
any
one
but
a
collier
it
is
that
big
chaval
now
said
a
miner
grinning
did
that
little
fellow
have
you
he
must
have
needed
a
ladder
i
saw
you
behind
réquillart
a
token
that
he
got
up
on
a
milestone
well
replied
mouquette
in
a
good
humour
what
that
to
do
with
you
you
were
not
asked
to
push
and
this
gross
joke
increased
the
laughter
of
the
men
who
expanded
their
shoulders
half
cooked
by
the
stove
while
she
herself
shaken
by
laughter
was
displaying
in
the
midst
of
them
the
indecency
of
her
costume
embarrassingly
comical
with
her
masses
of
flesh
exaggerated
almost
to
disease
but
the
gaiety
ceased
mouquette
told
maheu
that
fleurance
big
fleurance
would
never
come
again
she
had
been
found
the
night
before
stiff
in
her
bed
some
said
it
was
her
heart
others
that
it
was
a
pint
of
gin
she
had
drunk
too
quickly
and
maheu
was
in
despair
another
piece
of
one
of
the
best
of
his
putters
gone
without
any
chance
of
replacing
her
at
once
he
was
working
in
a
set
there
were
four
pikemen
associated
in
his
cutting
himself
zacharie
levaque
and
chaval
if
they
had
catherine
alone
to
wheel
the
work
would
suffer
suddenly
he
called
out
i
have
it
there
was
that
man
looking
for
work
at
that
moment
dansaert
passed
before
the
shed
maheu
told
him
the
story
and
asked
for
his
authority
to
engage
the
man
he
emphasized
the
desire
of
the
company
to
substitute
men
for
women
as
at
anzin
the
head
captain
smiled
at
first
for
the
scheme
of
excluding
women
from
the
pit
was
not
usually
well
received
by
the
miners
who
were
troubled
about
placing
their
daughters
and
not
much
affected
by
questions
of
morality
and
health
but
after
some
hesitation
he
gave
his
permission
reserving
its
ratification
for
monsieur
négrel
the
engineer
all
very
well
exclaimed
zacharie
the
man
must
be
away
by
this
time
no
said
catherine
i
saw
him
stop
at
the
boilers
after
him
then
lazy
cried
maheu
the
young
girl
ran
forward
while
a
crowd
of
miners
proceeded
to
the
shaft
yielding
the
fire
to
others
jeanlin
without
waiting
for
his
father
went
also
to
take
his
lamp
together
with
bébert
a
big
stupid
boy
and
lydie
a
small
child
of
ten
mouquette
who
was
in
front
of
them
called
out
in
the
black
passage
they
were
dirty
brats
and
threatened
to
box
their
ears
if
they
pinched
her
étienne
was
in
fact
in
the
boiler
building
talking
with
a
stoker
who
was
charging
the
furnaces
with
coal
he
felt
very
cold
at
the
thought
of
the
night
into
which
he
must
return
but
he
was
deciding
to
set
out
when
he
felt
a
hand
placed
on
his
shoulder
come
said
catherine
there
something
for
you
at
first
he
could
not
understand
then
he
felt
a
spasm
of
joy
and
vigorously
squeezed
the
young
girl
hands
thanks
mate
ah
you
a
good
chap
you
are
she
began
to
laugh
looking
at
him
in
the
red
light
of
the
furnaces
which
lit
them
up
it
amused
her
that
he
should
take
her
for
a
boy
still
slender
with
her
knot
of
hair
hidden
beneath
the
cap
he
also
was
laughing
with
satisfaction
and
they
remained
for
a
moment
both
laughing
in
each
other
faces
with
radiant
cheeks
maheu
squatting
down
before
his
box
in
the
shed
was
taking
off
his
sabots
and
his
coarse
woollen
stockings
when
étienne
arrived
everything
was
settled
in
three
or
four
words
thirty
sous
a
day
hard
work
but
work
that
he
would
easily
learn
the
pikeman
advised
him
to
keep
his
shoes
and
lent
him
an
old
cap
a
leather
hat
for
the
protection
of
his
skull
a
precaution
which
the
father
and
his
children
disdained
the
tools
were
taken
out
of
the
chest
where
also
was
found
fleurance
shovel
then
when
maheu
had
shut
up
their
sabots
their
stockings
as
well
as
étienne
bundle
he
suddenly
became
impatient
what
is
that
lazy
chaval
up
to
another
girl
given
a
tumble
on
a
pile
of
stones
we
are
half
an
hour
late
zacharie
and
levaque
were
quietly
roasting
their
shoulders
the
former
said
at
last
is
it
chaval
you
waiting
for
he
came
before
us
and
went
down
at
once
what
you
knew
that
and
said
nothing
come
come
look
sharp
catherine
who
was
warming
her
hands
had
to
follow
the
band
étienne
allowed
her
to
pass
and
went
behind
her
again
he
journeyed
through
a
maze
of
staircases
and
obscure
corridors
in
which
their
naked
feet
produced
the
soft
sound
of
old
slippers
but
the
was
glittering
a
glass
house
full
of
hooks
in
rows
holding
hundreds
of
davy
lamps
examined
and
washed
the
night
before
and
lighted
like
candles
in
a
mortuary
chapel
at
the
barrier
each
workman
took
his
own
stamped
with
his
number
then
he
examined
it
and
shut
it
himself
while
the
marker
seated
at
a
table
inscribed
on
the
registers
the
hour
of
descent
maheu
had
to
intervene
to
obtain
a
lamp
for
his
new
putter
and
there
was
still
another
precaution
the
workers
defiled
before
an
examiner
who
assured
himself
that
all
the
lamps
were
properly
closed
golly
it
not
warm
here
murmured
catherine
shivering
étienne
contented
himself
with
nodding
his
head
he
was
in
front
of
the
shaft
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
hall
swept
by
currents
of
air
he
certainly
considered
himself
brave
but
he
felt
a
disagreeable
emotion
at
his
chest
amid
this
thunder
of
trams
the
hollow
blows
of
the
signals
the
stifled
howling
of
the
trumpet
the
continual
flight
of
those
cables
unrolled
and
rolled
at
full
speed
by
the
drums
of
the
engine
the
cages
rose
and
sank
with
the
gliding
movement
of
a
nocturnal
beast
always
engulfing
men
whom
the
throat
of
the
hole
seemed
to
drink
it
was
his
turn
now
he
felt
very
cold
and
preserved
a
nervous
silence
which
made
zacharie
and
levaque
grin
for
both
of
them
disapproved
of
the
hiring
of
this
unknown
man
especially
levaque
who
was
offended
that
he
had
not
been
consulted
so
catherine
was
glad
to
hear
her
father
explain
things
to
the
young
man
look
above
the
cage
there
is
a
parachute
with
iron
grapnels
to
catch
into
the
guides
in
case
of
breakage
does
it
work
oh
not
always
yes
the
shaft
is
divided
into
three
compartments
closed
by
planking
from
top
to
bottom
in
the
middle
the
cages
on
the
left
the
passage
for
the
ladders
but
he
interrupted
himself
to
grumble
though
taking
care
not
to
raise
his
voice
much
what
are
we
stuck
here
for
blast
it
what
right
have
they
to
freeze
us
in
this
way
the
captain
richomme
who
was
going
down
himself
with
his
naked
lamp
fixed
by
a
nail
into
the
leather
of
his
cap
heard
him
careful
look
out
for
ears
he
murmured
paternally
as
an
old
miner
with
a
affectionate
feeling
for
comrades
workmen
must
do
what
they
can
hold
on
here
we
are
get
in
with
your
fellows
the
cage
provided
with
iron
bands
and
a
lattice
work
was
in
fact
awaiting
them
on
the
bars
maheu
zacharie
and
catherine
slid
into
a
tram
below
and
as
all
five
had
to
enter
étienne
in
his
turn
went
in
but
the
good
places
were
taken
he
had
to
squeeze
himself
near
the
young
girl
whose
elbow
pressed
into
his
belly
his
lamp
embarrassed
him
they
advised
him
to
fasten
it
to
the
of
his
jacket
not
hearing
he
awkwardly
kept
it
in
his
hand
the
embarkation
continued
above
and
below
a
confused
packing
of
cattle
they
did
not
however
set
out
what
then
was
happening
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
impatience
lasted
for
many
minutes
at
last
he
felt
a
shock
and
the
light
grew
dim
everything
around
him
seemed
to
fly
while
he
experienced
the
dizzy
anxiety
of
a
fall
contracting
his
bowels
this
lasted
as
long
as
he
could
see
light
through
the
two
reception
stories
in
the
midst
of
the
whirling
by
of
the
scaffolding
then
having
fallen
into
the
blackness
of
the
pit
he
became
stunned
no
longer
having
any
clear
perception
of
his
sensations
now
we
are
off
said
maheu
quietly
they
were
all
at
their
ease
he
asked
himself
at
times
if
he
was
going
up
or
down
now
and
then
when
the
cage
went
straight
without
touching
the
guides
there
seemed
to
be
no
motion
but
rough
shocks
were
afterwards
produced
a
sort
of
dancing
amid
the
joists
which
made
him
fear
a
catastrophe
for
the
rest
he
could
not
distinguish
the
walls
of
the
shaft
behind
the
lattice
work
to
which
he
pressed
his
face
the
lamps
feebly
lighted
the
mass
of
bodies
at
his
feet
only
the
naked
light
in
the
neighbouring
tram
shone
like
a
lighthouse
this
is
four
metres
in
diameter
continued
maheu
to
instruct
him
the
tubbing
wants
doing
over
again
for
the
water
comes
in
everywhere
stop
we
are
reaching
the
bottom
do
you
hear
étienne
was
in
fact
now
asking
himself
the
meaning
of
this
noise
of
falling
rain
a
few
large
drops
had
at
first
sounded
on
the
roof
of
the
cage
like
the
beginning
of
a
shower
and
now
the
rain
increased
streaming
down
becoming
at
last
a
deluge
the
roof
must
be
full
of
holes
for
a
thread
of
water
was
flowing
on
to
his
shoulder
and
wetting
him
to
the
skin
the
cold
became
icy
and
they
were
buried
in
black
humidity
when
they
passed
through
a
sudden
flash
of
light
the
vision
of
a
cavern
in
which
men
were
moving
but
already
they
had
fallen
back
into
darkness
maheu
said
that
is
the
first
main
level
we
are
at
three
hundred
and
twenty
metres
see
the
speed
raising
his
lamp
he
lighted
up
a
joist
of
the
guides
which
fled
by
like
a
rail
beneath
a
train
going
at
full
speed
and
beyond
as
before
nothing
could
be
seen
they
passed
three
other
levels
in
flashes
of
light
the
deafening
rain
continued
to
strike
through
the
darkness
how
deep
it
is
murmured
étienne
this
fall
seemed
to
last
for
hours
he
was
suffering
for
the
cramped
position
he
had
taken
not
daring
to
move
and
especially
tortured
by
catherine
elbow
she
did
not
speak
a
word
he
only
felt
her
against
him
and
it
warmed
him
when
the
cage
at
last
stopped
at
the
bottom
at
five
hundred
and
metres
he
was
astonished
to
learn
that
the
descent
had
lasted
exactly
one
minute
but
the
noise
of
the
bolts
fixing
themselves
the
sensation
of
solidity
beneath
suddenly
cheered
him
and
he
was
joking
when
he
said
to
catherine
what
have
you
got
under
your
skin
to
be
so
warm
i
got
your
elbow
in
my
belly
sure
enough
then
she
also
burst
out
laughing
stupid
of
him
still
to
take
her
for
a
boy
were
his
eyes
out
it
in
your
eye
that
you
got
my
elbow
she
replied
in
the
midst
of
a
storm
of
laughter
which
the
astonished
young
man
could
not
account
for
the
cage
voided
its
burden
of
workers
who
crossed
the
hall
a
chamber
cut
in
the
rock
vaulted
with
masonry
and
lighted
up
by
three
large
lamps
over
the
iron
flooring
the
porters
were
violently
rolling
laden
trams
a
cavernous
odour
exhaled
from
the
walls
a
freshness
of
saltpetre
in
which
mingled
hot
breaths
from
the
neighbouring
stable
the
openings
of
four
galleries
yawned
here
this
way
said
maheu
to
étienne
you
not
there
yet
it
is
still
two
kilometres
the
workmen
separated
and
were
lost
in
groups
in
the
depths
of
these
black
holes
some
fifteen
went
off
into
that
on
the
left
and
étienne
walked
last
behind
maheu
who
was
preceded
by
catherine
zacharie
and
levaque
it
was
a
large
gallery
for
wagons
through
a
bed
of
solid
rock
which
had
only
needed
walling
here
and
there
in
single
file
they
still
went
on
without
a
word
by
the
tiny
flame
of
the
lamps
the
young
man
stumbled
at
every
step
and
entangled
his
feet
in
the
rails
for
a
moment
a
hollow
sound
disturbed
him
the
sound
of
a
distant
storm
the
violence
of
which
seemed
to
increase
and
to
come
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
was
it
the
thunder
of
a
landslip
bringing
on
to
their
heads
the
enormous
mass
which
separated
them
from
the
light
a
gleam
pierced
the
night
he
felt
the
rock
tremble
and
when
he
had
placed
himself
close
to
the
wall
like
his
comrades
he
saw
a
large
white
horse
close
to
his
face
harnessed
to
a
train
of
wagons
on
the
first
and
holding
the
reins
was
seated
bébert
while
jeanlin
with
his
hands
leaning
on
the
edge
of
the
last
was
running
barefooted
behind
they
again
began
their
walk
farther
on
they
reached
crossways
where
two
new
galleries
opened
and
the
band
divided
again
the
workers
gradually
entering
all
the
stalls
of
the
mine
now
the
was
constructed
of
wood
props
of
timber
supported
the
roof
and
made
for
the
crumbly
rock
a
screen
of
scaffolding
behind
which
one
could
see
the
plates
of
schist
glimmering
with
mica
and
the
coarse
masses
of
dull
rough
sandstone
trains
of
tubs
full
or
empty
continually
passed
crossing
each
other
with
their
thunder
borne
into
the
shadow
by
vague
beasts
trotting
by
like
phantoms
on
the
double
way
of
a
shunting
line
a
long
black
serpent
slept
a
train
at
standstill
with
a
snorting
horse
whose
crupper
looked
like
a
block
fallen
from
the
roof
doors
for
ventilation
were
slowly
opening
and
shutting
and
as
they
advanced
the
gallery
became
more
narrow
and
lower
and
the
roof
irregular
forcing
them
to
bend
their
backs
constantly
étienne
struck
his
head
hard
without
his
leather
cap
he
would
have
broken
his
skull
however
he
attentively
followed
the
slightest
gestures
of
maheu
whose
sombre
profile
was
seen
against
the
glimmer
of
the
lamps
none
of
the
workmen
knocked
themselves
they
evidently
knew
each
boss
each
knot
of
wood
or
swelling
in
the
rock
the
young
man
also
suffered
from
the
slippery
soil
which
became
damper
and
damper
at
times
he
went
through
actual
puddles
only
revealed
by
the
muddy
splash
of
his
feet
but
what
especially
astonished
him
were
the
sudden
changes
of
temperature
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
it
was
very
chilly
and
in
the
through
which
all
the
air
of
the
mine
passed
an
icy
breeze
was
blowing
with
the
violence
of
a
tempest
between
the
narrow
walls
afterwards
as
they
penetrated
more
deeply
along
other
passages
which
only
received
a
meagre
share
of
air
the
wind
fell
and
the
heat
increased
a
suffocating
heat
as
heavy
as
lead
maheu
had
not
again
opened
his
mouth
he
turned
down
another
gallery
to
the
right
simply
saying
to
étienne
without
looking
round
the
guillaume
seam
it
was
the
seam
which
contained
their
cutting
at
the
first
step
étienne
hurt
his
head
and
elbows
the
sloping
roof
descended
so
low
that
for
twenty
or
thirty
metres
at
a
time
he
had
to
walk
bent
double
the
water
came
up
to
his
ankles
after
two
hundred
metres
of
this
he
saw
levaque
zacharie
and
catherine
disappear
as
though
they
had
flown
through
a
narrow
fissure
which
was
open
in
front
of
him
we
must
climb
said
maheu
fasten
your
lamp
to
a
and
hang
on
to
the
wood
he
himself
disappeared
and
étienne
had
to
follow
him
this
left
in
the
seam
was
reserved
for
miners
and
led
to
all
the
secondary
passages
it
was
about
the
thickness
of
the
hardly
sixty
centimetres
fortunately
the
young
man
was
thin
for
as
he
was
still
awkward
he
hoisted
himself
up
with
a
useless
expense
of
muscle
flattening
his
shoulders
and
hips
advancing
by
the
strength
of
his
wrists
clinging
to
the
planks
fifteen
metres
higher
they
came
on
the
first
secondary
passage
but
they
had
to
continue
as
the
cutting
of
maheu
and
his
mates
was
in
the
sixth
passage
in
hell
as
they
said
every
fifteen
metres
the
passages
were
placed
over
each
other
in
succession
through
this
cleft
which
scraped
back
and
chest
étienne
groaned
as
if
the
weight
of
the
rocks
had
pounded
his
limbs
with
torn
hands
and
bruised
legs
he
also
suffered
from
lack
of
air
so
that
he
seemed
to
feel
the
blood
bursting
through
his
skin
he
vaguely
saw
in
one
passage
two
squatting
beasts
a
big
one
and
a
little
one
pushing
trams
they
were
lydie
and
mouquette
already
at
work
and
he
had
still
to
climb
the
height
of
two
cuttings
he
was
blinded
by
sweat
and
he
despaired
of
catching
up
the
others
whose
agile
limbs
he
heard
brushing
against
the
rock
with
a
long
gliding
movement
cheer
up
here
we
are
said
catherine
voice
he
had
in
fact
arrived
and
another
voice
cried
from
the
bottom
of
the
cutting
well
is
this
the
way
to
treat
people
i
have
two
kilometres
to
walk
from
montsou
and
i
am
here
first
it
was
chaval
a
tall
lean
bony
fellow
of
with
strongly
marked
features
who
was
in
a
bad
humour
at
having
to
wait
when
he
saw
étienne
he
asked
with
contemptuous
surprise
what
that
and
when
maheu
had
told
him
the
story
he
added
between
his
teeth
these
men
are
eating
the
bread
of
girls
the
two
men
exchanged
a
look
lighted
up
by
one
of
those
instinctive
hatreds
which
suddenly
flame
up
étienne
had
felt
the
insult
without
yet
understanding
it
there
was
silence
and
they
got
to
work
at
last
all
the
seams
were
gradually
filled
and
the
cuttings
were
in
movement
at
every
level
and
at
the
end
of
every
passage
the
devouring
shaft
had
swallowed
its
daily
ration
of
men
nearly
seven
hundred
hands
who
were
now
at
work
in
this
giant
everywhere
making
holes
in
the
earth
drilling
it
like
an
old
piece
of
wood
and
in
the
middle
of
the
heavy
silence
and
crushing
weight
of
the
strata
one
could
hear
by
placing
one
ear
to
the
rock
the
movement
of
these
human
insects
at
work
from
the
flight
of
the
cable
which
moved
the
cage
up
and
down
to
the
biting
of
the
tools
cutting
out
the
coal
at
the
end
of
the
stalls
étienne
on
turning
round
found
himself
again
pressed
close
to
catherine
but
this
time
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
developing
curves
of
her
breast
he
suddenly
understood
the
warmth
which
had
penetrated
him
you
are
a
girl
then
he
exclaimed
stupefied
she
replied
in
her
cheerful
way
without
blushing
of
course
you
taken
your
time
to
find
it
out
chapter
iv
the
four
pikemen
had
spread
themselves
one
above
the
other
over
the
whole
face
of
the
cutting
separated
by
planks
hooked
on
to
retain
the
fallen
coal
they
each
occupied
about
four
metres
of
the
seam
and
this
seam
was
so
thin
scarcely
more
than
fifty
centimetres
thick
at
this
spot
that
they
seemed
to
be
flattened
between
the
roof
and
the
wall
dragging
themselves
along
by
their
knees
and
elbows
and
unable
to
turn
without
crushing
their
shoulders
in
order
to
attack
the
coal
they
had
to
lie
on
their
sides
with
their
necks
twisted
and
arms
raised
brandishing
in
a
sloping
direction
their
picks
below
there
was
first
zacharie
levaque
and
chaval
were
on
the
stages
above
and
at
the
very
top
was
maheu
each
worked
at
the
slaty
bed
which
he
dug
out
with
blows
of
the
pick
then
he
made
two
vertical
cuttings
in
the
bed
and
detached
the
block
by
burying
an
iron
wedge
in
its
upper
part
the
coal
was
rich
the
block
broke
and
rolled
in
fragments
along
their
bellies
and
thighs
when
these
fragments
retained
by
the
plank
had
collected
round
them
the
pikemen
disappeared
buried
in
the
narrow
cleft
maheu
suffered
most
at
the
top
the
temperature
rose
to
degrees
and
the
air
was
stagnant
so
that
in
the
long
run
it
became
lethal
in
order
to
see
he
had
been
obliged
to
fix
his
lamp
to
a
nail
near
his
head
and
this
lamp
close
to
his
skull
still
further
heated
his
blood
but
his
torment
was
especially
aggravated
by
the
moisture
the
rock
above
him
a
few
centimetres
from
his
face
streamed
with
water
which
fell
in
large
continuous
rapid
drops
with
a
sort
of
obstinate
rhythm
always
at
the
same
spot
it
was
vain
for
him
to
twist
his
head
or
bend
back
his
neck
they
fell
on
his
face
dropping
unceasingly
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
soaked
and
at
the
same
time
covered
with
sweat
smoking
as
with
the
hot
steam
of
a
laundry
this
morning
a
drop
beating
upon
his
eye
made
him
swear
he
would
not
leave
his
picking
he
dealt
great
strokes
which
shook
him
violently
between
the
two
rocks
like
a
fly
caught
between
two
leaves
of
a
book
and
in
danger
of
being
completely
flattened
not
a
word
was
exchanged
they
all
hammered
one
only
heard
these
irregular
blows
which
seemed
veiled
and
remote
the
sounds
had
a
sonorous
hoarseness
without
any
echo
in
the
dead
air
and
it
seemed
that
the
darkness
was
an
unknown
blackness
thickened
by
the
floating
coal
dust
made
heavy
by
the
gas
which
weighed
on
the
eyes
the
wicks
of
the
lamps
beneath
their
caps
of
metallic
tissue
only
showed
as
reddish
points
one
could
distinguish
nothing
the
cutting
opened
out
above
like
a
large
chimney
flat
and
oblique
in
which
the
soot
of
ten
years
had
amassed
a
profound
night
spectral
figures
were
moving
in
it
the
gleams
of
light
enabled
one
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
rounded
hip
a
knotty
arm
a
vigorous
head
besmeared
as
if
for
a
crime
sometimes
blocks
of
coal
shone
suddenly
as
they
became
detached
illuminated
by
a
crystalline
reflection
then
everything
fell
back
into
darkness
pickaxes
struck
great
hollow
blows
one
only
heard
panting
chests
the
grunting
of
discomfort
and
weariness
beneath
the
weight
of
the
air
and
the
rain
of
the
springs
zacharie
with
arms
weakened
by
a
spree
of
the
night
before
soon
left
his
work
on
the
pretence
that
more
timbering
was
necessary
this
allowed
him
to
forget
himself
in
quiet
whistling
his
eyes
vaguely
resting
in
the
shade
behind
the
pikemen
nearly
three
metres
of
the
seam
were
clear
and
they
had
not
yet
taken
the
precaution
of
supporting
the
rock
having
grown
careless
of
danger
and
miserly
of
their
time
here
you
swell
cried
the
young
man
to
étienne
hand
up
some
wood
étienne
who
was
learning
from
catherine
how
to
manage
his
shovel
had
to
raise
the
wood
in
the
cutting
a
small
supply
had
remained
over
from
yesterday
it
was
usually
sent
down
every
morning
ready
cut
to
fit
the
bed
hurry
up
there
damn
it
shouted
zacharie
seeing
the
new
putter
hoist
himself
up
awkwardly
in
the
midst
of
the
coal
his
arms
embarrassed
by
four
pieces
of
oak
he
made
a
hole
in
the
roof
with
his
pickaxe
and
then
another
in
the
wall
and
wedged
in
the
two
ends
of
the
wood
which
thus
supported
the
rock
in
the
afternoon
the
workers
in
the
earth
cutting
took
the
rubbish
left
at
the
bottom
of
the
gallery
by
the
pikemen
and
cleared
out
the
exhausted
section
of
the
seam
in
which
they
destroyed
the
wood
being
only
careful
about
the
lower
and
upper
roads
for
the
haulage
maheu
ceased
to
groan
at
last
he
had
detached
his
block
and
he
wiped
his
streaming
face
on
his
sleeve
he
was
worried
about
what
zacharie
was
doing
behind
him
let
it
be
he
said
we
will
see
after
breakfast
better
go
on
hewing
if
we
want
to
make
up
our
share
of
trams
it
because
it
sinking
replied
the
young
man
look
there
a
crack
it
may
slip
but
the
father
shrugged
his
shoulders
ah
nonsense
slip
and
if
it
did
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
they
would
get
out
of
it
all
right
he
grew
angry
at
last
and
sent
his
son
to
the
front
of
the
cutting
all
of
them
however
were
now
stretching
themselves
levaque
resting
on
his
back
was
swearing
as
he
examined
his
left
thumb
which
had
been
grazed
by
the
fall
of
a
piece
of
sandstone
chaval
had
taken
off
his
shirt
in
a
fury
and
was
working
with
bare
chest
and
back
for
the
sake
of
coolness
they
were
already
black
with
coal
soaked
in
a
fine
dust
diluted
with
sweat
which
ran
down
in
streams
and
pools
maheu
first
began
again
to
hammer
lower
down
with
his
head
level
with
the
rock
now
the
drop
struck
his
forehead
so
obstinately
that
he
seemed
to
feel
it
piercing
a
hole
in
the
bone
of
his
skull
you
must
mind
explained
catherine
to
étienne
they
are
always
howling
and
like
a
girl
she
went
on
with
her
lesson
every
laden
tram
arrived
at
the
top
in
the
same
condition
as
it
left
the
cutting
marked
with
a
special
metal
token
so
that
the
receiver
might
put
it
to
the
reckoning
of
the
stall
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
be
very
careful
to
fill
it
and
only
to
take
clean
coal
otherwise
it
was
refused
at
the
receiving
office
the
young
man
whose
eyes
were
now
becoming
accustomed
to
the
darkness
looked
at
her
still
white
with
her
chlorotic
complexion
and
he
could
not
have
told
her
age
he
thought
she
must
be
twelve
she
seemed
to
him
so
slight
however
he
felt
she
must
be
older
with
her
boyish
freedom
a
simple
audacity
which
confused
him
a
little
she
did
not
please
him
he
thought
her
too
roguish
with
her
pale
pierrot
head
framed
at
the
temples
by
the
cap
but
what
astonished
him
was
the
strength
of
this
child
a
nervous
strength
which
was
blended
with
a
good
deal
of
skill
she
filled
her
tram
faster
than
he
could
with
quick
small
regular
strokes
of
the
shovel
she
afterwards
pushed
it
to
the
inclined
way
with
a
single
slow
push
without
a
hitch
easily
passing
under
the
low
rocks
he
tore
himself
to
pieces
got
off
the
rails
and
was
reduced
to
despair
it
was
certainly
not
a
convenient
road
it
was
sixty
metres
from
the
cutting
to
the
upbrow
and
the
passage
which
the
miners
in
the
earth
cutting
had
not
yet
enlarged
was
a
mere
tube
with
a
very
irregular
roof
swollen
by
innumerable
bosses
at
certain
spots
the
laden
tram
could
only
just
pass
the
putter
had
to
flatten
himself
to
push
on
his
knees
in
order
not
to
break
his
head
and
besides
this
the
wood
was
already
bending
and
yielding
one
could
see
it
broken
in
the
middle
in
long
pale
rents
like
an
crutch
one
had
to
be
careful
not
to
graze
oneself
in
these
fractures
and
beneath
the
slow
crushing
which
caused
the
splitting
of
billets
of
oak
as
large
as
the
thigh
one
had
to
glide
almost
on
one
belly
with
a
secret
fear
of
suddenly
hearing
one
back
break
again
said
catherine
laughing
étienne
tram
had
gone
off
the
rails
at
the
most
difficult
spot
he
could
not
roll
straight
on
these
rails
which
sank
in
the
damp
earth
and
he
swore
became
angry
and
fought
furiously
with
the
wheels
which
he
could
not
get
back
into
place
in
spite
of
exaggerated
efforts
wait
a
bit
said
the
young
girl
if
you
get
angry
it
will
never
go
skilfully
she
had
glided
down
and
thrust
her
buttocks
beneath
the
tram
and
by
putting
the
weight
on
her
loins
she
raised
it
and
replaced
it
the
weight
was
seven
hundred
kilograms
surprised
and
ashamed
he
stammered
excuses
she
was
obliged
to
show
him
how
to
straddle
his
legs
and
brace
his
feet
against
the
planking
on
both
sides
of
the
gallery
in
order
to
give
himself
a
more
solid
fulcrum
the
body
had
to
be
bent
the
arms
made
stiff
so
as
to
push
with
all
the
muscles
of
the
shoulders
and
hips
during
the
journey
he
followed
her
and
watched
her
proceed
with
tense
back
her
fists
so
low
that
she
seemed
trotting
on
all
fours
like
one
of
those
dwarf
beasts
that
perform
at
circuses
she
sweated
panted
her
joints
cracked
but
without
a
complaint
with
the
indifference
of
custom
as
if
it
were
the
common
wretchedness
of
all
to
live
thus
bent
double
but
he
could
not
succeed
in
doing
as
much
his
shoes
troubled
him
his
body
seemed
broken
by
walking
in
this
way
with
lowered
head
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
the
position
became
a
torture
an
intolerable
anguish
so
painful
that
he
got
on
his
knees
for
a
moment
to
straighten
himself
and
breathe
then
at
the
upbrow
there
was
more
labour
she
taught
him
to
fill
his
tram
quickly
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
this
inclined
plane
which
served
all
the
cuttings
from
one
level
to
the
other
there
was
a
trammer
the
brakesman
above
the
receiver
below
these
scamps
of
twelve
to
fifteen
years
shouted
abominable
words
to
each
other
and
to
warn
them
it
was
necessary
to
yell
still
more
violently
then
as
soon
as
there
was
an
empty
tram
to
send
back
the
receiver
gave
the
signal
and
the
putter
embarked
her
full
tram
the
weight
of
which
made
the
other
ascend
when
the
brakesman
loosened
his
brake
below
in
the
bottom
gallery
were
formed
the
trains
which
the
horses
drew
to
the
shaft
here
you
confounded
rascals
cried
catherine
in
the
inclined
way
which
was
about
a
hundred
metres
long
and
resounded
like
a
gigantic
trumpet
the
trammers
must
have
been
resting
for
neither
of
them
replied
on
all
the
levels
haulage
had
stopped
a
shrill
girl
voice
said
at
last
one
of
them
must
be
on
mouquette
sure
enough
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
and
the
putters
of
the
whole
seam
held
their
sides
who
is
that
asked
étienne
of
catherine
the
latter
named
little
lydie
a
scamp
who
knew
more
than
she
ought
and
who
pushed
her
tram
as
stoutly
as
a
woman
in
spite
of
her
arms
as
to
mouquette
she
was
quite
capable
of
being
with
both
the
trammers
at
once
but
the
voice
of
the
receiver
arose
shouting
out
to
load
doubtless
a
captain
was
passing
beneath
haulage
began
again
on
the
nine
levels
and
one
only
heard
the
regular
calls
of
the
trammers
and
the
snorting
of
the
putters
arriving
at
the
upbrow
and
steaming
like
mares
it
was
the
element
of
bestiality
which
breathed
in
the
pit
the
sudden
desire
of
the
male
when
a
miner
met
one
of
these
girls
on
all
fours
with
her
flanks
in
the
air
and
her
hips
bursting
through
her
boy
breeches
and
on
each
journey
étienne
found
again
at
the
bottom
the
stuffiness
of
the
cutting
the
hollow
and
broken
cadence
of
the
axes
the
deep
painful
sighs
of
the
pikemen
persisting
in
their
work
all
four
were
naked
mixed
up
with
the
coal
soaked
with
black
mud
up
to
the
cap
at
one
moment
it
had
been
necessary
to
free
maheu
who
was
gasping
and
to
remove
the
planks
so
that
the
coal
could
fall
into
the
passage
zacharie
and
levaque
became
enraged
with
the
seam
which
was
now
hard
they
said
and
which
would
make
the
condition
of
their
account
disastrous
chaval
turned
lying
for
a
moment
on
his
back
abusing
étienne
whose
presence
decidedly
exasperated
him
a
sort
of
worm
has
the
strength
of
a
girl
are
you
going
to
fill
your
tub
it
to
spare
your
arms
eh
damned
if
i
do
keep
back
the
ten
sous
if
you
get
us
one
refused
the
young
man
avoided
replying
too
happy
at
present
to
have
found
this
convict
labour
and
accepting
the
brutal
rule
of
the
worker
by
master
worker
but
he
could
no
longer
walk
his
feet
were
bleeding
his
limbs
torn
by
horrible
cramps
his
body
confined
in
an
iron
girdle
fortunately
it
was
ten
and
the
stall
decided
to
have
breakfast
maheu
had
a
watch
but
he
did
not
even
look
at
it
at
the
bottom
of
this
starless
night
he
was
never
five
minutes
out
all
put
on
their
shirts
and
jackets
then
descending
from
the
cutting
they
squatted
down
their
elbows
to
their
sides
their
buttocks
on
their
heels
in
that
posture
so
habitual
with
miners
that
they
keep
it
even
when
out
of
the
mine
without
feeling
the
need
of
a
stone
or
a
beam
to
sit
on
and
each
having
taken
out
his
brick
bit
seriously
at
the
thick
slice
uttering
occasional
words
on
the
morning
work
catherine
who
remained
standing
at
last
joined
étienne
who
had
stretched
himself
out
farther
along
across
the
rails
with
his
back
against
the
planking
there
was
a
place
there
almost
dry
you
do
eat
she
said
to
him
with
her
mouth
full
and
her
brick
in
her
hand
then
she
remembered
that
this
youth
wandering
about
at
night
without
a
sou
perhaps
had
not
a
bit
of
bread
will
you
share
with
me
and
as
he
refused
declaring
that
he
was
not
hungry
while
his
voice
trembled
with
the
gnawing
in
his
stomach
she
went
on
cheerfully
ah
if
you
are
fastidious
but
here
i
only
bitten
on
that
side
i
give
you
this
she
had
already
broken
the
bread
and
butter
into
two
pieces
the
young
man
taking
his
half
restrained
himself
from
devouring
it
all
at
once
and
placed
his
arms
on
his
thighs
so
that
she
should
not
see
how
he
trembled
with
her
quiet
air
of
good
comradeship
she
lay
beside
him
at
full
length
on
her
stomach
with
her
chin
in
one
hand
slowly
eating
with
the
other
their
lamps
placed
between
them
lit
up
their
faces
catherine
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
she
must
have
found
him
handsome
with
his
delicate
face
and
black
moustache
she
vaguely
smiled
with
pleasure
then
you
are
an
and
they
sent
you
away
from
your
railway
why
because
i
struck
my
chief
she
remained
stupefied
overwhelmed
with
her
hereditary
ideas
of
subordination
and
passive
obedience
i
ought
to
say
that
i
had
been
drinking
he
went
on
and
when
i
drink
i
get
mad
i
could
devour
myself
and
i
could
devour
other
people
yes
i
ca
swallow
two
small
glasses
without
wanting
to
kill
someone
then
i
am
ill
for
two
days
you
must
drink
she
said
seriously
ah
do
be
afraid
i
know
myself
and
he
shook
his
head
he
hated
brandy
with
the
hatred
of
the
last
child
of
a
race
of
drunkards
who
suffered
in
his
flesh
from
all
those
ancestors
soaked
and
driven
mad
by
alcohol
to
such
a
point
that
the
least
drop
had
become
poison
to
him
it
is
because
of
mother
that
i
did
like
being
turned
into
the
street
he
said
after
having
swallowed
a
mouthful
mother
is
not
happy
and
i
used
to
send
her
a
piece
now
and
then
where
is
she
then
your
mother
at
paris
laundress
rue
de
la
there
was
silence
when
he
thought
of
these
things
a
tremor
dimmed
his
dark
eyes
the
sudden
anguish
of
the
injury
he
brooded
over
in
his
fine
youthful
strength
for
a
moment
he
remained
with
his
looks
buried
in
the
darkness
of
the
mine
and
at
that
depth
beneath
the
weight
and
suffocation
of
the
earth
he
saw
his
childhood
again
his
mother
still
beautiful
and
strong
forsaken
by
his
father
then
taken
up
again
after
having
married
another
man
living
with
the
two
men
who
ruined
her
rolling
with
them
in
the
gutter
in
drink
and
ordure
it
was
down
there
he
recalled
the
street
the
details
came
back
to
him
the
dirty
linen
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
the
drunken
carousals
that
made
the
house
stink
and
the
blows
now
he
began
again
in
a
slow
voice
i
have
even
thirty
sous
to
make
her
presents
with
she
will
die
of
misery
sure
enough
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
despair
and
again
bit
at
his
bread
and
butter
will
you
drink
asked
catherine
uncorking
her
tin
oh
it
coffee
it
wo
hurt
you
one
gets
dry
when
one
eats
like
that
but
he
refused
it
was
quite
enough
to
have
taken
half
her
bread
however
she
insisted
and
said
at
last
well
i
will
drink
before
you
since
you
are
so
polite
only
you
refuse
now
it
would
be
rude
she
held
out
her
tin
to
him
she
had
got
on
to
her
knees
and
he
saw
her
quite
close
to
him
lit
up
by
the
two
lamps
why
had
he
found
her
ugly
now
that
she
was
black
her
face
powdered
with
fine
charcoal
she
seemed
to
him
singularly
charming
in
this
face
surrounded
by
shadow
the
teeth
in
the
broad
mouth
shone
with
whiteness
while
the
eyes
looked
large
and
gleamed
with
a
greenish
reflection
like
a
eyes
a
lock
of
red
hair
which
had
escaped
from
her
cap
tickled
her
ear
and
made
her
laugh
she
no
longer
seemed
so
young
she
might
be
quite
fourteen
to
please
you
he
said
drinking
and
giving
her
back
the
tin
she
swallowed
a
second
mouthful
and
forced
him
to
take
one
too
wishing
to
share
she
said
and
that
little
tin
that
went
from
one
mouth
to
the
other
amused
them
he
suddenly
asked
himself
if
he
should
not
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
lips
she
had
large
lips
of
a
pale
rose
colour
made
vivid
by
the
coal
which
tormented
him
with
increasing
desire
but
he
did
not
dare
intimidated
before
her
only
having
known
girls
on
the
streets
at
lille
of
the
lowest
order
and
not
realizing
how
one
ought
to
behave
with
a
still
living
with
her
family
you
must
be
about
fourteen
then
he
asked
after
having
gone
back
to
his
bread
she
was
astonished
almost
angry
what
fourteen
but
i
am
fifteen
it
true
i
not
big
girls
grow
quick
with
us
he
went
on
questioning
her
and
she
told
everything
without
boldness
or
shame
for
the
rest
she
was
not
ignorant
concerning
man
and
woman
although
he
felt
that
her
body
was
virginal
with
the
virginity
of
a
child
delayed
in
her
sexual
maturity
by
the
environment
of
bad
air
and
weariness
in
which
she
lived
when
he
spoke
of
mouquette
in
order
to
embarrass
her
she
told
some
horrible
stories
in
a
quiet
voice
with
much
amusement
ah
she
did
some
fine
things
and
as
he
asked
if
she
herself
had
no
lovers
she
replied
jokingly
that
she
did
not
wish
to
vex
her
mother
but
that
it
must
happen
some
day
her
shoulders
were
bent
she
shivered
a
little
from
the
coldness
of
her
garments
soaked
in
sweat
with
a
gentle
resigned
air
ready
to
submit
to
things
and
men
people
can
find
lovers
when
they
all
live
together
ca
they
sure
enough
and
then
it
does
hurt
any
one
one
does
tell
the
priest
oh
the
priest
i
do
care
for
him
but
there
is
the
black
man
what
do
you
mean
the
black
man
the
old
miner
who
comes
back
into
the
pit
and
wrings
naughty
necks
he
looked
at
her
afraid
that
she
was
making
fun
of
him
you
believe
in
those
stupid
things
then
you
do
know
anything
yes
i
do
i
can
read
and
write
that
is
useful
among
us
in
father
and
mother
time
they
learnt
nothing
she
was
certainly
very
charming
when
she
had
finished
her
bread
and
butter
he
would
take
her
and
kiss
her
on
her
large
rosy
lips
it
was
the
resolution
of
timidity
a
thought
of
violence
which
choked
his
voice
these
boy
clothes
this
jacket
and
these
breeches
on
the
girl
flesh
excited
and
troubled
him
he
had
swallowed
his
last
mouthful
he
drank
from
the
tin
and
gave
it
back
for
her
to
empty
now
the
moment
for
action
had
come
and
he
cast
a
restless
glance
at
the
miners
farther
on
but
a
shadow
blocked
the
gallery
for
a
moment
chaval
stood
and
looked
at
them
from
afar
he
came
forward
having
assured
himself
that
maheu
could
not
see
him
and
as
catherine
was
seated
on
the
earth
he
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
drew
her
head
back
and
tranquilly
crushed
her
mouth
beneath
a
brutal
kiss
affecting
not
to
notice
étienne
there
was
in
that
kiss
an
act
of
possession
a
sort
of
jealous
resolution
however
the
young
girl
was
offended
let
me
go
do
you
hear
he
kept
hold
of
her
head
and
looked
into
her
eyes
his
moustache
and
small
red
beard
flamed
in
his
black
face
with
its
large
eagle
nose
he
let
her
go
at
last
and
went
away
without
speaking
a
word
a
shudder
had
frozen
étienne
it
was
stupid
to
have
waited
he
could
certainly
not
kiss
her
now
for
she
would
perhaps
think
that
he
wished
to
behave
like
the
other
in
his
wounded
vanity
he
experienced
real
despair
why
did
you
lie
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
your
lover
but
no
i
swear
she
cried
there
is
not
that
between
us
sometimes
he
likes
a
joke
he
does
even
belong
here
it
six
months
since
he
came
from
the
both
rose
work
was
about
to
be
resumed
when
she
saw
him
so
cold
she
seemed
annoyed
doubtless
she
found
him
handsomer
than
the
other
she
would
have
preferred
him
perhaps
the
idea
of
some
amiable
consoling
relationship
disturbed
her
and
when
the
young
man
saw
with
surprise
that
his
lamp
was
burning
blue
with
a
large
pale
ring
she
tried
at
least
to
amuse
him
come
i
will
show
you
something
she
said
in
a
friendly
way
when
she
had
led
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
cutting
she
pointed
out
to
him
a
crevice
in
the
coal
a
slight
bubbling
escaped
from
it
a
little
noise
like
the
warbling
of
a
bird
put
your
hand
there
you
feel
the
wind
it
he
was
surprised
was
that
all
was
that
the
terrible
thing
which
blew
everything
up
she
laughed
she
said
there
was
a
good
deal
of
it
to
make
the
flame
of
the
lamps
so
blue
now
if
you
done
chattering
lazy
louts
cried
maheu
rough
voice
catherine
and
étienne
hastened
to
fill
their
trams
and
pushed
them
to
the
upbrow
with
stiffened
back
crawling
beneath
the
bossy
roof
of
the
passage
even
after
the
second
journey
the
sweat
ran
off
them
and
their
joints
began
to
crack
the
pikemen
had
resumed
work
in
the
cutting
the
men
often
shortened
their
breakfast
to
avoid
getting
cold
and
their
bricks
eaten
in
this
way
far
from
the
sun
with
silent
voracity
loaded
their
stomachs
with
lead
stretched
on
their
sides
they
hammered
more
loudly
with
the
one
fixed
idea
of
filling
a
large
number
of
trams
every
thought
disappeared
in
this
rage
for
gain
which
was
so
hard
to
earn
they
no
longer
felt
the
water
which
streamed
on
them
and
swelled
their
limbs
the
cramps
of
forced
attitudes
the
suffocation
of
the
darkness
in
which
they
grew
pale
like
plants
put
in
a
cellar
yet
as
the
day
advanced
the
air
became
more
poisoned
and
heated
with
the
smoke
of
the
lamps
with
the
pestilence
of
their
breaths
with
the
asphyxia
of
the
blinding
to
the
eyes
like
spiders
webs
which
only
the
aeration
of
the
night
could
sweep
away
at
the
bottom
of
their
beneath
the
weight
of
the
earth
with
no
more
breath
in
their
inflamed
lungs
they
went
on
hammering
chapter
v
maheu
without
looking
at
his
watch
which
he
had
left
in
his
jacket
stopped
and
said
one
directly
zacharie
is
it
done
the
young
man
had
just
been
at
the
planking
in
the
midst
of
his
labour
he
had
been
lying
on
his
back
with
dreamy
eyes
thinking
over
a
game
of
hockey
of
the
night
before
he
woke
up
and
replied
yes
it
will
do
we
shall
see
and
he
came
back
to
take
his
place
at
the
cutting
levaque
and
chaval
had
also
dropped
their
picks
they
were
all
resting
they
wiped
their
faces
on
their
naked
arms
and
looked
at
the
roof
in
which
slaty
masses
were
cracking
they
only
spoke
about
their
work
another
chance
murmured
chaval
of
getting
into
loose
earth
they
did
take
account
of
that
in
the
bargain
rascals
growled
levaque
they
only
want
to
bury
us
in
it
zacharie
began
to
laugh
he
cared
little
for
the
work
and
the
rest
but
it
amused
him
to
hear
the
company
abused
in
his
placid
way
maheu
explained
that
the
nature
of
the
soil
changed
every
twenty
metres
one
must
be
just
they
could
not
foresee
everything
then
when
the
two
others
went
on
talking
against
the
masters
he
became
restless
and
looked
around
him
hush
that
enough
you
right
said
levaque
also
lowering
his
voice
it
wholesome
a
morbid
dread
of
spies
haunted
them
even
at
this
depth
as
if
the
shareholders
coal
while
still
in
the
seam
might
have
ears
that
wo
prevent
me
added
chaval
loudly
in
a
defiant
manner
from
lodging
a
brick
in
the
belly
of
that
damned
dansaert
if
he
talks
to
me
as
he
did
the
other
day
i
wo
prevent
him
i
wo
from
buying
pretty
girls
with
a
white
skin
this
time
zacharie
burst
out
laughing
the
head
captain
love
for
pierronne
was
a
constant
joke
in
the
pit
even
catherine
rested
on
her
shovel
at
the
bottom
of
the
cutting
holding
her
sides
and
in
a
few
words
told
étienne
the
joke
while
maheu
became
angry
seized
by
a
fear
which
he
could
not
conceal
will
you
hold
your
tongue
eh
wait
till
you
alone
if
you
want
to
get
into
trouble
he
was
still
speaking
when
the
sound
of
steps
was
heard
in
the
upper
gallery
almost
immediately
the
engineer
of
the
mine
little
négrel
as
the
workmen
called
him
among
themselves
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
cutting
accompanied
by
dansaert
the
head
captain
did
i
say
so
muttered
maheu
there
always
someone
there
rising
out
of
the
ground
paul
négrel
hennebeau
nephew
was
a
young
man
of
refined
and
handsome
with
curly
hair
and
brown
moustache
his
pointed
nose
and
sparkling
eyes
gave
him
the
air
of
an
amiable
ferret
of
sceptical
intelligence
which
changed
into
an
abrupt
authoritative
manner
in
his
relations
with
the
workmen
he
was
dressed
like
them
and
like
them
smeared
with
coal
to
make
them
respect
him
he
exhibited
a
courage
passing
through
the
most
difficult
spots
and
always
first
when
landslips
or
explosions
occurred
here
we
are
are
we
not
dansaert
he
asked
the
head
captain
a
belgian
with
a
large
sensual
nose
replied
with
exaggerated
politeness
yes
monsieur
négrel
here
is
the
man
who
was
taken
on
this
morning
both
of
them
had
slid
down
into
the
middle
of
the
cutting
they
made
étienne
come
up
the
engineer
raised
his
lamp
and
looked
at
him
without
asking
any
questions
good
he
said
at
last
but
i
do
like
unknown
men
to
be
picked
up
from
the
road
do
do
it
again
he
did
not
listen
to
the
explanations
given
to
him
the
necessities
of
work
the
desire
to
replace
women
by
men
for
the
haulage
he
had
begun
to
examine
the
roof
while
the
pikemen
had
taken
up
their
picks
again
suddenly
he
called
out
i
say
there
maheu
have
you
no
care
for
life
by
heavens
you
will
all
be
buried
here
oh
it
solid
replied
the
workman
tranquilly
what
solid
but
the
rock
is
giving
already
and
you
are
planting
props
at
more
than
two
metres
as
if
you
grudged
it
ah
you
are
all
alike
you
will
let
your
skull
be
flattened
rather
than
leave
the
seam
to
give
the
necessary
time
to
the
timbering
i
must
ask
you
to
prop
that
immediately
double
the
timbering
do
you
understand
and
in
face
of
the
unwillingness
of
the
miners
who
disputed
the
point
saying
that
they
were
good
judges
of
their
safety
he
became
angry
go
along
when
your
heads
are
smashed
is
it
you
who
will
have
to
bear
the
consequences
not
at
all
it
will
be
the
company
which
will
have
to
pay
you
pensions
you
or
your
wives
i
tell
you
again
that
we
know
you
in
order
to
get
two
extra
trams
by
evening
you
would
sell
your
skins
maheu
in
spite
of
the
anger
which
was
gradually
mastering
him
still
answered
steadily
if
they
paid
us
enough
we
should
prop
it
better
the
engineer
shrugged
his
shoulders
without
replying
he
had
descended
the
cutting
and
only
said
in
conclusion
from
below
you
have
an
hour
set
to
work
all
of
you
and
i
give
you
notice
that
the
stall
is
fined
three
francs
a
low
growl
from
the
pikemen
greeted
these
words
the
force
of
the
system
alone
restrained
them
that
military
system
which
from
the
trammer
to
the
head
captain
ground
one
beneath
the
other
chaval
and
levaque
however
made
a
furious
gesture
while
maheu
restrained
them
by
a
glance
and
zacharie
shrugged
his
shoulders
chaffingly
but
étienne
was
perhaps
most
affected
since
he
had
found
himself
at
the
bottom
of
this
hell
a
slow
rebellion
was
rising
within
him
he
looked
at
the
resigned
catherine
with
her
lowered
back
was
it
possible
to
kill
oneself
at
this
hard
toil
in
this
deadly
darkness
and
not
even
to
gain
the
few
pence
to
buy
one
daily
bread
however
négrel
went
off
with
dansaert
who
was
content
to
approve
by
a
continual
movement
of
his
head
and
their
voices
again
rose
they
had
just
stopped
once
more
and
were
examining
the
timbering
in
the
gallery
which
the
pikemen
were
obliged
to
look
after
for
a
length
of
ten
metres
behind
the
cutting
did
i
tell
you
that
they
care
nothing
cried
the
engineer
and
you
why
in
the
devil
name
do
you
watch
them
but
i
do
i
do
stammered
the
head
captain
one
gets
tired
of
repeating
things
négrel
called
loudly
maheu
maheu
they
all
came
down
he
went
on
do
you
see
that
will
that
hold
it
a
construction
here
is
a
beam
which
the
posts
do
carry
already
it
was
done
so
hastily
by
jove
i
understand
how
it
is
that
the
mending
costs
us
so
much
it
do
wo
it
if
it
lasts
as
long
as
you
have
the
care
of
it
and
then
it
may
go
smash
and
the
company
is
obliged
to
have
an
army
of
repairers
look
at
it
down
there
it
is
mere
botching
chaval
wished
to
speak
but
he
silenced
him
no
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
let
them
pay
you
more
eh
very
well
i
warn
you
that
you
will
force
the
managers
to
do
something
they
will
pay
you
the
planking
separately
and
proportionately
reduce
the
price
of
the
trams
we
shall
see
if
you
will
gain
that
way
meanwhile
prop
that
over
again
at
once
i
shall
pass
amid
the
dismay
caused
by
this
threat
he
went
away
dansaert
who
had
been
so
humble
remained
behind
a
few
moments
to
say
brutally
to
the
men
you
get
me
into
a
row
you
here
i
give
you
something
more
than
three
francs
fine
i
will
look
out
then
when
he
had
gone
maheu
broke
out
in
his
turn
by
god
what
fair
is
fair
i
like
people
to
be
calm
because
the
only
way
of
getting
along
but
at
last
they
make
you
mad
did
you
hear
the
tram
lowered
and
the
planking
separately
another
way
of
paying
us
less
by
god
it
is
he
looked
for
someone
upon
whom
to
vent
his
anger
and
saw
catherine
and
étienne
swinging
their
arms
will
you
just
fetch
me
some
wood
what
does
it
matter
to
you
i
put
my
foot
into
you
somewhere
étienne
went
to
carry
it
without
rancour
for
this
rough
speech
so
furious
himself
against
the
masters
that
he
thought
the
miners
too
as
for
the
others
levaque
and
chaval
had
found
relief
in
strong
language
all
of
them
even
zacharie
were
timbering
furiously
for
nearly
half
an
hour
one
only
heard
the
creaking
of
wood
wedged
in
by
blows
of
the
hammer
they
no
longer
spoke
they
snorted
became
enraged
with
the
rock
which
they
would
have
hustled
and
driven
back
by
the
force
of
their
shoulders
if
they
had
been
able
that
enough
said
maheu
at
last
worn
out
with
anger
and
fatigue
an
hour
and
a
half
a
fine
day
work
we
sha
get
fifty
sous
off
this
disgusts
me
though
there
was
still
half
an
hour
of
work
left
he
dressed
himself
the
others
imitated
him
the
mere
sight
of
the
cutting
enraged
them
as
the
putter
had
gone
back
to
the
haulage
they
called
her
irritated
at
her
zeal
let
the
coal
take
care
of
itself
and
the
six
their
tools
under
their
arms
set
out
to
walk
the
two
kilometres
back
returning
to
the
shaft
by
the
road
of
the
morning
at
the
chimney
catherine
and
étienne
were
delayed
while
the
pikemen
slid
down
they
met
little
lydie
who
stopped
in
a
gallery
to
let
them
pass
and
told
them
of
the
disappearance
of
mouquette
whose
nose
had
been
bleeding
so
much
that
she
had
been
away
an
hour
bathing
her
face
somewhere
no
one
knew
where
then
when
they
left
her
the
child
began
again
to
push
her
tram
weary
and
muddy
stiffening
her
arms
and
legs
like
a
lean
black
ant
struggling
with
a
load
that
was
too
heavy
for
it
they
let
themselves
down
on
their
backs
flattening
their
shoulders
for
fear
of
scratching
the
skin
on
their
foreheads
and
they
walked
so
close
to
the
polished
rock
at
the
back
of
the
stalls
that
they
were
obliged
from
time
to
time
to
hold
on
to
the
woodwork
so
that
their
backsides
should
not
catch
fire
as
they
said
jokingly
below
they
found
themselves
alone
red
stars
disappeared
afar
at
a
bend
in
the
passage
their
cheerfulness
fell
they
began
to
walk
with
the
heavy
step
of
fatigue
she
in
front
he
behind
their
lamps
were
blackened
he
could
scarcely
see
her
drowned
in
a
sort
of
smoky
mist
and
the
idea
that
she
was
a
girl
disturbed
him
because
he
felt
that
it
was
stupid
not
to
embrace
her
and
yet
the
recollection
of
the
other
man
prevented
him
certainly
she
had
lied
to
him
the
other
was
her
lover
they
lay
together
on
all
those
heaps
of
slaty
coal
for
she
had
a
loose
woman
gait
he
sulked
without
reason
as
if
she
had
deceived
him
she
however
every
moment
turned
round
warned
him
of
obstacles
and
seemed
to
invite
him
to
be
affectionate
they
were
so
lost
here
it
would
have
been
so
easy
to
laugh
together
like
good
friends
at
last
they
entered
the
large
haulage
gallery
it
was
a
relief
to
the
indecision
from
which
he
was
suffering
while
she
once
more
had
a
saddened
look
the
regret
for
a
happiness
which
they
would
not
find
again
now
the
subterranean
life
rumbled
around
them
with
a
continual
passing
of
captains
the
come
and
go
of
the
trams
drawn
by
trotting
horses
lamps
starred
the
night
everywhere
they
had
to
efface
themselves
against
the
rock
to
leave
the
path
free
to
shadowy
men
and
beasts
whose
breath
came
against
their
faces
jeanlin
running
barefooted
behind
his
tram
cried
out
some
naughtiness
to
them
which
they
could
not
hear
amid
the
thunder
of
the
wheels
they
still
went
on
she
now
silent
he
not
recognizing
the
turnings
and
roads
of
the
morning
and
fancying
that
she
was
leading
him
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
earth
and
what
specially
troubled
him
was
the
cold
an
increasing
cold
which
he
had
felt
on
emerging
from
the
cutting
and
which
caused
him
to
shiver
the
more
the
nearer
they
approached
the
shaft
between
the
narrow
walls
the
column
of
air
now
blew
like
a
tempest
he
despaired
of
ever
coming
to
the
end
when
suddenly
they
found
themselves
in
the
hall
chaval
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
them
his
mouth
drawn
with
suspicion
the
others
were
there
covered
with
sweat
in
the
icy
current
silent
like
himself
swallowing
their
grunts
of
rage
they
had
arrived
too
soon
and
could
not
be
taken
to
the
top
for
half
an
hour
more
especially
since
some
complicated
manoeuvres
were
going
on
for
lowering
a
horse
the
porters
were
still
rolling
the
trams
with
the
deafening
sound
of
old
iron
in
movement
and
the
cages
were
flying
up
disappearing
in
the
rain
which
fell
from
the
black
hole
below
the
sump
a
cesspool
ten
metres
deep
filled
with
this
streaming
water
also
exhaled
its
muddy
moisture
men
were
constantly
moving
around
the
shaft
pulling
the
signal
cords
pressing
on
the
arms
of
levers
in
the
midst
of
this
spray
in
which
their
garments
were
soaked
the
reddish
light
of
three
open
lamps
cut
out
great
moving
shadows
and
gave
to
this
subterranean
hall
the
air
of
a
villainous
cavern
some
bandits
forge
near
a
torrent
maheu
made
one
last
effort
he
approached
pierron
who
had
gone
on
duty
at
six
here
you
might
as
well
let
us
go
up
but
the
porter
a
handsome
fellow
with
strong
limbs
and
a
gentle
face
refused
with
a
frightened
gesture
impossible
ask
the
captain
they
would
fine
me
fresh
growls
were
stifled
catherine
bent
forward
and
said
in
ear
come
and
see
the
stable
then
that
a
comfortable
place
and
they
had
to
escape
without
being
seen
for
it
was
forbidden
to
go
there
it
was
on
the
left
at
the
end
of
a
short
gallery
metres
in
length
and
nearly
four
high
cut
in
the
rock
and
vaulted
with
bricks
it
could
contain
twenty
horses
it
was
in
fact
comfortable
there
there
was
a
pleasant
warmth
of
living
beasts
the
good
odour
of
fresh
and
litter
the
only
lamp
threw
out
the
calm
rays
of
a
there
were
horses
there
at
rest
who
turned
their
heads
with
their
large
infantine
eyes
then
went
back
to
their
hay
without
haste
like
fat
workers
loved
by
everybody
but
as
catherine
was
reading
aloud
their
names
written
on
zinc
plates
over
the
mangers
she
uttered
a
slight
cry
seeing
something
suddenly
rise
before
her
it
was
mouquette
who
emerged
in
fright
from
a
pile
of
straw
in
which
she
was
sleeping
on
monday
when
she
was
overtired
with
her
sunday
spree
she
gave
herself
a
violent
blow
on
the
nose
and
left
her
cutting
under
the
pretence
of
seeking
water
to
bury
herself
here
with
the
horses
in
the
warm
litter
her
father
being
weak
with
her
allowed
it
at
the
risk
of
getting
into
trouble
just
then
mouque
the
father
entered
a
short
bald
looking
man
but
still
stout
which
is
rare
in
an
old
miner
of
fifty
since
he
had
been
made
a
groom
he
chewed
to
such
a
degree
that
his
gums
bled
in
his
black
mouth
on
seeing
the
two
with
his
daughter
he
became
angry
what
are
you
up
to
there
all
of
you
come
up
the
jades
bringing
a
man
here
it
a
fine
thing
to
come
and
do
your
dirty
tricks
in
my
straw
mouquette
thought
it
funny
and
held
her
sides
but
étienne
feeling
awkward
moved
away
while
catherine
smiled
at
him
as
all
three
returned
to
the
bébert
and
jeanlin
arrived
there
also
with
a
train
of
tubs
there
was
a
stoppage
for
the
manoeuvring
of
the
cages
and
the
young
girl
approached
their
horse
caressed
it
with
her
hand
and
talked
about
it
to
her
companion
it
was
bataille
the
of
the
mine
a
white
horse
who
had
lived
below
for
ten
years
these
ten
years
he
had
lived
in
this
hole
occupying
the
same
corner
of
the
stable
doing
the
same
task
along
the
black
galleries
without
ever
seeing
daylight
very
fat
with
shining
coat
and
a
air
he
seemed
to
lead
the
existence
of
a
sage
sheltered
from
the
evils
of
the
world
above
in
this
darkness
too
he
had
become
very
cunning
the
passage
in
which
he
worked
had
grown
so
familiar
to
him
that
he
could
open
the
ventilation
doors
with
his
head
and
he
lowered
himself
to
avoid
knocks
at
the
narrow
spots
without
doubt
also
he
counted
his
turns
for
when
he
had
made
the
regulation
number
of
journeys
he
refused
to
do
any
more
and
had
to
be
led
back
to
his
manger
now
that
old
age
was
coming
on
his
cat
eyes
were
sometimes
dimmed
with
melancholy
perhaps
he
vaguely
saw
again
in
the
depths
of
his
obscure
dreams
the
mill
at
which
he
was
born
near
marchiennes
a
mill
placed
on
the
edge
of
the
scarpe
surrounded
by
large
fields
over
which
the
wind
always
blew
something
burnt
in
the
air
an
enormous
lamp
the
exact
appearance
of
which
escaped
his
beast
memory
and
he
stood
with
lowered
head
trembling
on
his
old
feet
making
useless
efforts
to
recall
the
sun
meanwhile
the
manoeuvres
went
on
in
the
shaft
the
signal
hammer
had
struck
four
blows
and
the
horse
was
being
lowered
there
was
always
excitement
at
such
a
time
for
it
sometimes
happened
that
the
beast
was
seized
by
such
terror
that
it
was
landed
dead
when
put
into
a
net
at
the
top
it
struggled
fiercely
then
when
it
felt
the
ground
no
longer
beneath
it
it
remained
as
if
petrified
and
disappeared
without
a
quiver
of
the
skin
with
enlarged
and
fixed
eyes
this
animal
being
too
big
to
pass
between
the
guides
it
had
been
necessary
when
hooking
it
beneath
the
cage
to
pull
down
the
head
and
attach
it
to
the
flanks
the
descent
lasted
nearly
three
minutes
the
engine
being
slowed
as
a
precaution
below
the
excitement
was
increasing
what
then
was
he
going
to
be
left
on
the
road
hanging
in
the
blackness
at
last
he
appeared
in
his
stony
immobility
his
eye
fixed
and
dilated
with
terror
it
was
a
bay
horse
hardly
three
years
of
age
called
trompette
attention
cried
father
mouque
whose
duty
it
was
to
receive
it
bring
him
here
do
undo
him
yet
trompette
was
soon
placed
on
the
metal
floor
in
a
mass
still
he
did
not
move
he
seemed
in
a
nightmare
in
this
obscure
infinite
hole
this
deep
hall
echoing
with
tumult
they
were
beginning
to
unfasten
him
when
bataille
who
had
just
been
unharnessed
approached
and
stretched
out
his
neck
to
smell
this
companion
who
lay
on
the
earth
the
workmen
jokingly
enlarged
the
circle
well
what
pleasant
odour
did
he
find
in
him
but
bataille
deaf
to
mockery
became
animated
he
probably
found
in
him
the
good
odour
of
the
open
air
the
forgotten
odour
of
the
sun
on
the
grass
and
he
suddenly
broke
out
into
a
sonorous
neigh
full
of
musical
gladness
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
the
emotion
of
a
sob
it
was
a
greeting
the
joy
of
those
ancient
things
of
which
a
gust
had
reached
him
the
melancholy
of
one
more
prisoner
who
would
not
ascend
again
until
death
ah
that
animal
bataille
shouted
the
workmen
amused
at
the
antics
of
their
favourite
he
talking
with
his
mate
trompette
was
unbound
but
still
did
not
move
he
remained
on
his
flank
as
if
he
still
felt
the
net
restraining
him
garrotted
by
fear
at
last
they
got
him
up
with
a
lash
of
the
whip
dazed
and
his
limbs
quivering
and
father
mouque
led
away
the
two
beasts
fraternizing
together
here
is
it
ready
yet
asked
maheu
it
was
necessary
to
clear
the
cages
and
besides
it
was
yet
ten
minutes
before
the
hour
for
ascending
little
by
little
the
stalls
emptied
and
the
miners
returned
from
all
the
galleries
there
were
already
some
fifty
men
there
damp
and
shivering
their
inflamed
chests
panting
on
every
side
pierron
in
spite
of
his
mawkish
face
struck
his
daughter
lydie
because
she
had
left
the
cutting
before
time
zacharie
slyly
pinched
mouquette
with
a
joke
about
warming
himself
but
the
discontent
increased
chaval
and
levaque
narrated
the
engineer
threat
the
tram
to
be
lowered
in
price
and
the
planking
paid
separately
and
exclamations
greeted
this
scheme
a
rebellion
was
germinating
in
this
little
corner
nearly
six
hundred
metres
beneath
the
earth
soon
they
could
not
restrain
their
voices
these
men
soiled
by
coal
and
frozen
by
the
delay
accused
the
company
of
killing
half
their
workers
at
the
bottom
and
starving
the
other
half
to
death
étienne
listened
trembling
quick
quick
repeated
the
captain
richomme
to
the
porters
he
hastened
the
preparations
for
the
ascent
not
wishing
to
be
hard
pretending
not
to
hear
however
the
murmurs
became
so
loud
that
he
was
obliged
to
notice
them
they
were
calling
out
behind
him
that
this
would
not
last
always
and
that
one
fine
day
the
whole
affair
would
be
smashed
up
you
sensible
he
said
to
maheu
make
them
hold
their
tongues
when
one
has
got
power
one
must
have
sense
but
maheu
who
was
getting
calm
and
had
at
last
become
anxious
did
not
interfere
suddenly
the
voices
fell
négrel
and
dansaert
returning
from
their
inspection
entered
from
a
gallery
both
of
them
sweating
the
habit
of
discipline
made
the
men
stand
in
rows
while
the
engineer
passed
through
the
group
without
a
word
he
got
into
one
tram
and
the
head
captain
into
another
the
signal
was
sounded
five
times
ringing
for
the
butcher
meat
as
they
said
for
the
masters
and
the
cage
flew
up
in
the
air
in
the
midst
of
a
gloomy
silence
chapter
vi
as
he
ascended
in
the
cage
heaped
up
with
four
others
étienne
resolved
to
continue
his
famished
course
along
the
roads
one
might
as
well
die
at
once
as
go
down
to
the
bottom
of
that
hell
where
it
was
not
even
possible
to
earn
one
bread
catherine
in
the
tram
above
him
was
no
longer
at
his
side
with
her
pleasant
enervating
warmth
and
he
preferred
to
avoid
foolish
thoughts
and
to
go
away
for
with
his
wider
education
he
felt
nothing
of
the
resignation
of
this
flock
he
would
end
by
strangling
one
of
the
masters
suddenly
he
was
blinded
the
ascent
had
been
so
rapid
that
he
was
stunned
by
the
daylight
and
his
eyelids
quivered
in
the
brightness
to
which
he
had
already
grown
unaccustomed
it
was
none
the
less
a
relief
to
him
to
feel
the
cage
settle
on
to
the
bars
a
lander
opened
the
door
and
a
flood
of
workmen
leapt
out
of
the
trams
i
say
mouquet
whispered
zacharie
in
the
lander
ear
are
we
off
to
the
volcan
the
volcan
was
a
at
montsou
mouquet
winked
his
left
eye
with
a
silent
laugh
which
made
his
jaws
gape
short
and
stout
like
his
father
he
had
the
impudent
face
of
a
fellow
who
devours
everything
without
care
for
the
morrow
just
then
mouquette
came
out
in
her
turn
and
he
gave
her
a
formidable
smack
on
the
flank
by
way
of
fraternal
tenderness
étienne
hardly
recognized
the
lofty
nave
of
the
which
had
before
looked
imposing
in
the
ambiguous
light
of
the
lanterns
it
was
simply
bare
and
dirty
a
dull
light
entered
through
the
dusty
windows
the
engine
alone
shone
at
the
end
with
its
copper
the
steel
cables
moved
like
ribbons
soaked
in
ink
and
the
pulleys
above
the
enormous
scaffold
which
supported
them
the
cages
the
trams
all
this
prodigality
of
metal
made
the
hall
look
sombre
with
their
hard
grey
tones
of
old
iron
without
ceasing
the
rumbling
of
the
wheels
shook
the
metal
floor
while
from
the
coal
thus
put
in
motion
there
arose
a
fine
charcoal
powder
which
powdered
black
the
soil
the
walls
even
the
joists
of
the
steeple
but
chaval
after
glancing
at
the
table
of
counters
in
the
little
glass
office
came
back
furious
he
had
discovered
that
two
of
their
trams
had
been
rejected
one
because
it
did
not
contain
the
regulation
amount
the
other
because
the
coal
was
not
clean
this
finishes
the
day
he
cried
twenty
sous
less
again
this
is
because
we
take
on
lazy
rascals
who
use
their
arms
as
a
pig
does
his
tail
and
his
sidelong
look
at
étienne
completed
his
thought
the
latter
was
tempted
to
reply
by
a
blow
then
he
asked
himself
what
would
be
the
use
since
he
was
going
away
this
decided
him
absolutely
it
not
possible
to
do
it
right
the
first
day
said
maheu
to
restore
peace
he
do
better
they
were
all
none
the
less
soured
and
disturbed
by
the
need
to
quarrel
as
they
passed
to
the
lamp
cabin
to
give
up
their
lamps
levaque
began
to
abuse
the
whom
he
accused
of
not
properly
cleaning
his
lamp
they
only
slackened
down
a
little
in
the
shed
where
the
fire
was
still
burning
it
had
even
been
too
heavily
piled
up
for
the
stove
was
red
and
the
vast
room
without
a
window
seemed
to
be
in
flames
to
such
a
degree
did
the
reflection
make
bloody
the
walls
and
there
were
grunts
of
joy
all
the
backs
were
roasted
at
a
distance
till
they
smoked
like
soup
when
their
flanks
were
burning
they
cooked
their
bellies
mouquette
had
tranquilly
let
down
her
breeches
to
dry
her
chemise
some
lads
were
making
fun
of
her
they
burst
out
laughing
because
she
suddenly
showed
them
her
posterior
a
gesture
which
in
her
was
the
extreme
expression
of
contempt
i
off
said
chaval
who
had
shut
up
his
tools
in
his
box
no
one
moved
only
mouquette
hastened
and
went
out
behind
him
on
the
pretext
that
they
were
both
going
back
to
montsou
but
the
others
went
on
joking
they
knew
that
he
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
her
catherine
however
who
seemed
preoccupied
was
speaking
in
a
low
voice
to
her
father
the
latter
was
surprised
then
he
agreed
with
a
nod
and
calling
étienne
to
give
him
back
his
bundle
listen
he
said
you
have
a
sou
you
will
have
time
to
starve
before
the
fortnight
out
shall
i
try
and
get
you
credit
somewhere
the
young
man
stood
for
a
moment
confused
he
had
been
just
about
to
claim
his
thirty
sous
and
go
but
shame
restrained
him
before
the
young
girl
she
looked
at
him
fixedly
perhaps
she
would
think
he
was
shirking
the
work
you
know
i
can
promise
you
nothing
maheu
went
on
they
can
but
refuse
us
then
étienne
consented
they
would
refuse
besides
it
would
bind
him
to
nothing
he
could
still
go
away
after
having
eaten
something
then
he
was
dissatisfied
at
not
having
refused
seeing
catherine
joy
a
pretty
laugh
a
look
of
friendship
happy
at
having
been
useful
to
him
what
was
the
good
of
it
all
when
they
had
put
on
their
sabots
and
shut
their
boxes
the
maheus
left
the
shed
following
their
comrades
who
were
leaving
one
by
one
after
they
had
warmed
themselves
étienne
went
behind
levaque
and
his
urchin
joined
the
band
but
as
they
crossed
the
screening
place
a
scene
of
violence
stopped
them
it
was
in
a
vast
shed
with
beams
blackened
by
the
powder
and
large
shutters
through
which
blew
a
constant
current
of
air
the
coal
trams
arrived
straight
from
the
and
were
then
overturned
by
the
on
to
hoppers
long
iron
slides
and
to
right
and
to
left
of
these
the
screeners
mounted
on
steps
and
armed
with
shovels
and
rakes
separated
the
stone
and
swept
together
the
clean
coal
which
afterwards
fell
through
funnels
into
the
railway
wagons
beneath
the
shed
philoméne
levaque
was
there
thin
and
pale
with
the
face
of
a
girl
who
spat
blood
with
head
protected
by
a
fragment
of
blue
wool
and
hands
and
arms
black
to
the
elbows
she
was
screening
beneath
an
old
witch
the
mother
of
pierronne
the
brulé
as
she
was
called
with
terrible
owl
eyes
and
a
mouth
drawn
in
like
a
miser
purse
they
were
abusing
each
other
the
young
one
accusing
the
elder
of
raking
her
stones
so
that
she
could
not
get
a
basketful
in
ten
minutes
they
were
paid
by
the
basket
and
these
quarrels
were
constantly
arising
hair
was
flying
and
hands
were
making
black
marks
on
red
faces
give
it
her
bloody
well
cried
zacharie
from
above
to
his
mistress
all
the
screeners
laughed
but
the
brulé
turned
snappishly
on
the
young
man
now
then
dirty
beast
you
better
to
own
the
two
kids
you
have
filled
her
with
fancy
that

the

out

forth
irregularly
with

made

out
beneath

looked

into

catherine
had
stood
a
moment
motionless
gazing
once
more
at
the
young
man
with
her
large
eyes
full
of
greenish
limpidity
like
spring

the
crystal
deepened

more
by
her

she
smiled
and
disappeared
with
the
others
on
the
road
that
led
up
to
the
settlement
the
inn
was
situated
between
the
village
and
the
mine
at
the
crossing
of
two
roads
it
was
a
brick
house
whitewashed
from
top
to
bottom
enlivened
around
the
windows
by
a
broad
border
on
a
square
nailed
above

the
company
who
had
done
everything
to
buy
up
the
property
placed
within
its
vast
territory
was
in
despair
over
this
inn
in
the
open
fields
at
the
very
entrance
of
the
voreux
go
in
said
maheu
to
étienne
the
little
parlour
was
quite
bare
with
its
white
walls
its
three
tables
and
its
dozen
chairs
its
deal
counter
about
the
size
of
a
kitchen

there
were
a
dozen
glasses
at
most
three
bottles
of
liqueur
a
decanter
a
small
zinc
tank
with
a
pewter
tap
to
hold
the
beer
and
nothing
else
not
a
figure
not
a
little
table
not
a
game
in
the
metal
fireplace
which
was
bright
and
polished
a
coal
fire
was
burning
quietly
on
the
flags
a
thin
layer
of
white
sand
drank
up
the
constant
moisture
of
this
land

a

fair
girl

sometimes
took

of
the
place

rasseneur
in
the
girl
turned
the
tap
replying
that
the
master
would
soon
return
in
a
long
slow
gulp
the
miner
emptied
half
his
glass
to
sweep
away
the
dust
which
filled
his
throat
he
offered
nothing
to
his
companion
one
other
customer
a
damp
and
besmeared
miner
was
seated
before
the
table
drinking
his
beer
in
silence
with
an
air
of
deep
meditation
a
third
entered
was
served
in
response
to
a
gesture
paid
and
went
away
without
uttering
a
word
but
a
stout
man
of
with
a
round
shaven
face
and
a
smile
now
appeared
it
was
rasseneur
a
former
pikeman
whom
the
company
had
dismissed
three
years
ago
after
a
strike
a
very
good
workman
he
could
speak
well
put
himself
at
the
head
of
every
opposition
and
had
at
last
become
the
chief
of
the
discontented
his
wife
already
held
a
license
like
many
miners
wives
and
when
he
was
thrown
on
to
the
street
he
became
an
innkeeper
himself
having
found
the
money
he
placed
his
inn
in
front
of
the
voreux
as
a
provocation
to
the
company
now
his
house
had
prospered
it
had
become
a
centre
and
he
was
enriched
by
the
animosity
he
had
gradually
fostered
in
the
hearts
of
his
old
comrades
this
is
a
lad
i
hired
this
morning
said
maheu
at
once
have
you
got
one
of
your
two
rooms
free
and
will
you
give
him
credit
for
a
fortnight
rasseneur
broad
face
suddenly
expressed
great
suspicion
he
examined
étienne
with
a
glance
and
replied
without
giving
himself
the
trouble
to
express
any
regret
my
two
rooms
are
taken
ca
do
it
the
young
man
expected
this
refusal
but
it
hurt
him
nevertheless
and
he
was
surprised
at
the
sudden
grief
he
experienced
in
going
no
matter
he
would
go
when
he
had
received
his
thirty
sous
the
miner
who
was
drinking
at
a
table
had
left
others
one
by
one
continued
to
come
in
to
clear
their
throats
then
went
on
their
road
with
the
same
slouching
gait
it
was
a
simple
swilling
without
joy
or
passion
the
silent
satisfaction
of
a
need
then
there
no
news
rasseneur
asked
in
a
peculiar
tone
of
maheu
who
was
finishing
his
beer
in
small
gulps
the
latter
turned
his
head
and
saw
that
only
étienne
was
near
there
been
more
squabbling
yes
about
the
timbering
he
told
the
story
the
innkeeper
face
reddened
swelling
with
emotion
which
flamed
in
his
skin
and
eyes
at
last
he
broke
out
well
well
if
they
decide
to
lower
the
price
they
are
done
for
étienne
constrained
him
however
he
went
on
throwing
sidelong
glances
in
his
direction
and
there
were
reticences
and
implications
he
was
talking
of
the
manager
hennebeau
of
his
wife
of
his
nephew
the
little
négrel
without
naming
them
repeating
that
this
could
not
go
on
that
things
were
bound
to
smash
up
one
of
these
fine
days
the
misery
was
too
great
and
he
spoke
of
the
workshops
that
were
closing
the
workers
who
were
going
away
during
the
last
month
he
had
given
more
than
six
pounds
of
bread
a
day
he
had
heard
the
day
before
that
deneulin
the
owner
of
a
neighbouring
pit
could
scarcely
keep
going
he
had
also
received
a
letter
from
lille
full
of
disturbing
details
you
know
he
whispered
it
comes
from
that
person
you
saw
here
one
evening
but
he
was
interrupted
his
wife
entered
in
her
turn
a
tall
woman
lean
and
keen
with
a
long
nose
and
violet
cheeks
she
was
a
much
more
radical
politician
than
her
husband
pluchart
letter
she
said
ah
if
that
fellow
was
master
things
would
soon
go
better
étienne
had
been
listening
for
a
moment
he
understood
and
became
excited
over
these
ideas
of
misery
and
revenge
this
name
suddenly
uttered
caused
him
to
start
he
said
aloud
as
if
in
spite
of
himself
i
know
him
pluchart
they
looked
at
him
he
had
to
add
yes
i
am
an
he
was
my
foreman
at
lille
a
capable
man
i
have
often
talked
with
him
rasseneur
examined
him
afresh
and
there
was
a
rapid
change
on
his
face
a
sudden
sympathy
at
last
he
said
to
his
wife
it
maheu
who
brings
me
this
gentleman
one
of
his
putters
to
see
if
there
is
a
room
for
him
upstairs
and
if
we
can
give
him
credit
for
a
fortnight
then
the
matter
was
settled
in
four
words
there
was
a
room
the
lodger
had
left
that
morning
and
the
innkeeper
who
was
very
excited
talked
more
freely
repeating
that
he
only
asked
possibilities
from
the
masters
without
demanding
like
so
many
others
things
that
were
too
hard
to
get
his
wife
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
demanded
justice
absolutely
good
evening
interrupted
maheu
all
that
wo
prevent
men
from
going
down
and
as
long
as
they
go
there
will
be
people
working
themselves
to
death
look
how
fresh
you
are
these
three
years
that
you
been
out
of
it
yes
i
very
much
better
declared
rasseneur
complacently
étienne
went
as
far
as
the
door
thanking
the
miner
who
was
leaving
but
the
latter
nodded
his
head
without
adding
a
word
and
the
young
man
watched
him
painfully
climb
up
the
road
to
the
settlement
madame
rasseneur
occupied
with
serving
customers
asked
him
to
wait
a
minute
when
she
would
show
him
his
room
where
he
could
clean
himself
should
he
remain
he
again
felt
hesitation
a
discomfort
which
made
him
regret
the
freedom
of
the
open
road
the
hunger
beneath
the
sun
endured
with
the
joy
of
being
one
own
master
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
lived
years
from
his
arrival
on
the
in
the
midst
of
squalls
to
those
hours
passed
under
the
earth
on
his
belly
in
the
black
passages
and
he
shrank
from
beginning
again
it
was
unjust
and
too
hard
his
man
pride
revolted
at
the
idea
of
becoming
a
crushed
and
blinded
beast
while
étienne
was
thus
debating
with
himself
his
eyes
wandering
over
the
immense
plain
gradually
began
to
see
it
clearly
he
was
surprised
he
had
not
imagined
the
horizon
was
like
this
when
old
bonnemort
had
pointed
it
out
to
him
in
the
darkness
before
him
he
plainly
saw
the
voreux
in
a
fold
of
the
earth
with
its
wood
and
brick
buildings
the
tarred
the
steeple
the
and
the
tall
pale
red
chimney
all
massed
together
with
that
evil
air
but
around
these
buildings
the
space
extended
and
he
had
not
imagined
it
so
large
changed
into
an
inky
sea
by
the
ascending
waves
of
coal
soot
bristling
with
high
trestles
which
carried
the
rails
of
the
encumbered
in
one
corner
with
the
timber
supply
which
looked
like
the
harvest
of
a
mown
forest
towards
the
right
the
hid
the
view
colossal
as
a
barricade
of
giants
already
covered
with
grass
in
its
older
part
consumed
at
the
other
end
by
an
interior
fire
which
had
been
burning
for
a
year
with
a
thick
smoke
leaving
at
the
surface
in
the
midst
of
the
pale
grey
of
the
slates
and
sandstones
long
trails
of
bleeding
rust
then
the
fields
unrolled
the
endless
fields
of
wheat
and
beetroot
naked
at
this
season
of
the
year
marshes
with
scanty
vegetation
cut
by
a
few
stunted
willows
distant
meadows
separated
by
slender
rows
of
poplars
very
far
away
little
pale
patches
indicated
towns
marchiennes
to
the
north
montsou
to
the
south
while
the
forest
of
vandame
to
the
east
bordered
the
horizon
with
the
violet
line
of
its
leafless
trees
and
beneath
the
livid
sky
in
the
faint
daylight
of
this
winter
afternoon
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
blackness
of
the
voreux
and
all
its
flying
coal
dust
had
fallen
upon
the
plain
powdering
the
trees
sanding
the
roads
sowing
the
earth
étienne
looked
and
what
especially
surprised
him
was
a
canal
the
canalized
stream
of
the
scarpe
which
he
had
not
seen
in
the
night
from
the
voreux
to
marchiennes
this
canal
ran
straight
like
a
dull
silver
ribbon
two
leagues
long
an
avenue
lined
by
large
trees
raised
above
the
low
earth
threading
into
space
with
the
perspective
of
its
green
banks
its
pale
water
into
which
glided
the
vermilion
of
the
boats
near
one
pit
there
was
a
wharf
with
moored
vessels
which
were
laden
directly
from
the
trams
at
the
afterwards
the
canal
made
a
curve
sloping
by
the
marshes
and
the
whole
soul
of
that
smooth
plain
appeared
to
lie
in
this
geometrical
stream
which
traversed
it
like
a
great
road
carting
coal
and
iron
étienne
glance
went
up
from
the
canal
to
the
settlement
built
on
the
height
of
which
he
could
only
distinguish
the
red
tiles
then
his
eyes
rested
again
at
the
bottom
of
the
clay
slope
towards
the
voreux
on
two
enormous
masses
of
bricks
made
and
burnt
on
the
spot
a
branch
of
the
company
railroad
passed
behind
a
paling
for
the
use
of
the
pit
they
must
be
sending
down
the
last
miners
to
the
only
one
shrill
note
came
from
a
truck
pushed
by
men
one
felt
no
longer
the
unknown
darkness
the
inexplicable
thunder
the
flaming
of
mysterious
stars
afar
the
blast
furnaces
and
the
coke
kilns
had
paled
with
the
dawn
there
only
remained
unceasingly
the
escapement
of
the
pump
always
breathing
with
the
same
thick
long
breath
the
ogre
breath
of
which
he
could
now
see
the
grey
steam
and
which
nothing
could
satiate
then
étienne
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
perhaps
he
seemed
to
see
again
catherine
clear
eyes
up
there
at
the
entrance
to
the
settlement
perhaps
rather
it
was
the
wind
of
revolt
which
came
from
the
voreux
he
did
not
know
but
he
wished
to
go
down
again
to
the
mine
to
suffer
and
to
fight
and
he
thought
fiercely
of
those
people
bonnemort
had
talked
of
the
crouching
and
sated
god
to
whom
ten
thousand
starving
men
gave
their
flesh
without
knowing
it
part
two
chapter
i
the
grégoires
property
piolaine
was
situated
two
kilometres
to
the
east
of
montsou
on
the
joiselle
road
the
house
was
a
large
square
building
without
style
dating
from
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
of
all
the
land
that
once
belonged
to
it
there
only
remained
some
thirty
hectares
enclosed
by
walls
and
easy
to
keep
up
the
orchard
and
kitchen
garden
especially
were
everywhere
spoken
of
being
famous
for
the
finest
fruit
and
vegetables
in
the
country
for
the
rest
there
was
no
park
only
a
small
wood
the
avenue
of
old
limes
a
vault
of
foliage
three
hundred
metres
long
reaching
from
the
gate
to
the
porch
was
one
of
the
curiosities
of
this
bare
plain
on
which
one
could
count
the
large
trees
between
marchiennes
and
beaugnies
on
that
morning
the
grégoires
got
up
at
eight
usually
they
never
stirred
until
an
hour
later
being
heavy
sleepers
but
last
night
tempest
had
disturbed
them
and
while
her
husband
had
gone
at
once
to
see
if
the
wind
had
made
any
havoc
madame
grégoire
went
down
to
the
kitchen
in
her
slippers
and
flannel
she
was
short
and
stout
about
years
of
age
and
retained
a
broad
surprised
dollish
face
beneath
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
her
hair
mélanie
she
said
to
the
cook
suppose
you
were
to
make
the
brioche
this
morning
since
the
dough
is
ready
mademoiselle
will
not
get
up
for
half
an
hour
yet
and
she
can
eat
it
with
her
chocolate
eh
it
will
be
a
surprise
the
cook
a
lean
old
woman
who
had
served
them
for
thirty
years
laughed
that
true
it
will
be
a
famous
surprise
my
stove
is
alight
and
the
oven
must
be
hot
and
then
honorine
can
help
me
a
bit

a
girl
of
some
twenty
years
who
had
been
taken
in
as
a
child
and
brought
up
in
the
house
now
acted
as
housemaid
besides
these
two
women
the
only
other
servant
was
the
coachman
francis
who
undertook
the
heavy
work
a
gardener
and
his
wife
were
occupied
with
the
vegetables
the
fruit
the
flowers
and
the
and
as
service
here
was
patriarchal
this
little
world
lived
together
like
one
large
family
on
very
good
terms
madame
grégoire
who
had
planned
this
surprise
of
the
brioche
in
bed
waited
to
see
the
dough
put
in
the
oven
the
kitchen
was
very
large
and
one
guessed
it
was
the
most
important
room
in
the
house
by
its
extreme
cleanliness
and
by
the
arsenal
of
saucepans
utensils
and
pots
which
filled
it
it
gave
an
impression
of
good
feeding
provisions
abounded
hanging
from
hooks
or
in
cupboards
and
let
it
be
well
glazed
wo
you
madame
grégoire
said
as
she
passed
into
the
in
spite
of
the
stove
which
warmed
the
whole
house
a
coal
fire
enlivened
this
room
in
other
respects
it
exhibited
no
luxury
a
large
table
chairs
a
mahogany
sideboard
only
two
deep
betrayed
a
love
of
comfort
long
happy
hours
of
digestion
they
never
went
into
the
they
remained
here
in
a
family
circle
just
then
grégoire
came
back
dressed
in
a
thick
fustian
jacket
he
also
was
ruddy
for
his
sixty
years
with
large
honest
features
beneath
the
snow
of
his
curly
hair
he
had
seen
the
coachman
and
the
gardener
there
had
been
no
damage
of
importance
nothing
but
a
fallen
every
morning
he
liked
to
give
a
glance
round
piolaine
which
was
not
large
enough
to
cause
him
anxiety
and
from
which
he
derived
all
the
happiness
of
ownership
and
cécile
he
asked
is
she
up
yet
then
i
ca
make
it
out
replied
his
wife
i
thought
i
heard
her
moving
the
table
was
set
there
were
three
cups
on
the
white
cloth
they
sent
honorine
to
see
what
had
become
of
mademoiselle
but
she
came
back
immediately
restraining
her
laughter
stifling
her
voice
as
if
she
were
still
upstairs
in
the
bedroom
oh
if
monsieur
and
madame
could
see
mademoiselle
she
sleeps
oh
she
sleeps
like
an
angel
one
ca
imagine
it
it
a
pleasure
to
look
at
her
the
father
and
mother
exchanged
tender
looks
he
said
smiling
will
you
come
and
see
the
poor
little
darling
she
murmured
i
come
and
they
went
up
together
the
room
was
the
only
luxurious
one
in
the
house
it
was
draped
in
blue
silk
and
the
furniture
was
lacquered
white
with
blue
tracery
a
spoilt
child
whim
which
her
parents
had
gratified
in
the
vague
whiteness
of
the
bed
beneath
the
which
came
through
a
curtain
that
was
drawn
back
the
young
girl
was
sleeping
with
her
cheek
resting
on
her
naked
arm
she
was
not
pretty
too
healthy
in
too
vigorous
condition
fully
developed
at
eighteen
but
she
had
superb
flesh
the
freshness
of
milk
with
her
chestnut
hair
her
round
face
and
little
willful
nose
lost
between
her
cheeks
the
coverlet
had
slipped
down
and
she
was
breathing
so
softly
that
her
respiration
did
not
even
lift
her
already
bosom
that
horrible
wind
must
have
prevented
her
from
closing
her
eyes
said
the
mother
softly
the
father
imposed
silence
with
a
gesture
both
of
them
leant
down
and
gazed
with
adoration
on
this
girl
in
her
virgin
nakedness
whom
they
had
desired
so
long
and
who
had
come
so
late
when
they
had
no
longer
hoped
for
her
they
found
her
perfect
not
at
all
too
fat
and
could
never
feed
her
sufficiently
and
she
went
on
sleeping
without
feeling
them
near
her
with
their
faces
against
hers
however
a
slight
movement
disturbed
her
motionless
face
they
feared
that
they
would
wake
her
and
went
out
on
tiptoe
hush
said
grégoire
at
the
door
if
she
has
not
slept
we
must
leave
her
sleeping
as
long
as
she
likes
the
darling
agreed
madame
grégoire
we
will
wait
they
went
down
and
seated
themselves
in
the
in
the
while
the
servants
laughing
at
mademoiselle
sound
sleep
kept
the
chocolate
on
the
stove
without
grumbling
he
took
up
a
newspaper
she
knitted
at
a
large
woollen
quilt
it
was
very
hot
and
not
a
sound
was
heard
in
the
silent
house
the
grégoires
fortune
about
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
was
entirely
invested
in
a
share
of
the
montsou
mines
they
would
complacently
narrate
its
origin
which
dated
from
the
very
formation
of
the
company
towards
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
there
had
been
a
mad
search
for
coal
between
lille
and
valenciennes
the
success
of
those
who
held
the
concession
which
was
afterwards
to
become
the
anzin
company
had
turned
all
heads
in
every
commune
the
ground
was
tested
and
societies
were
formed
and
concessions
grew
up
in
a
night
but
among
all
the
obstinate
seekers
of
that
epoch
baron
desrumaux
had
certainly
left
the
reputation
for
the
most
heroic
intelligence
for
forty
years
he
had
struggled
without
yielding
in
the
midst
of
continual
obstacles
early
searches
unsuccessful
new
pits
abandoned
at
the
end
of
long
months
of
work
landslips
which
filled
up
borings
sudden
inundations
which
drowned
the
workmen
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
thrown
into
the
earth
then
the
squabbles
of
the
management
the
panics
of
the
shareholders
the
struggle
with
the
lords
of
the
soil
who
were
resolved
not
to
recognize
royal
concessions
if
no
treaty
was
first
made
with
themselves
he
had
at
last
founded
the
association
of
desrumaux
fauquenoix
and
to
exploit
the
montsou
concession
and
the
pits
began
to
yield
a
small
profit
when
two
neighbouring
concessions
that
of
cougny
belonging
to
the
comte
de
cougny
and
that
of
joiselle
belonging
to
the
cornille
and
jenard
company
had
nearly
overwhelmed
him
beneath
the
terrible
assault
of
their
competition
happily
on
the
august
a
treaty
was
made
between
the
three
concessions
uniting
them
into
a
single
one
the
montsou
mining
company
was
created
such
as
it
still
exists
in
the
distribution
they
had
divided
the
total
property
according
to
the
standard
of
the
money
of
the
time
into
sous
of
which
each
was
subdivided
into
twelve
deniers
which
made
two
hundred
and
deniers
and
as
the
denier
was
worth
ten
thousand
francs
the
capital
represented
a
sum
of
nearly
three
millions
desrumaux
dying
but
triumphant
received
in
this
division
six
sous
and
three
deniers
in
those
days
the
baron
possessed
piolaine
which
had
three
hundred
hectares
belonging
to
it
and
he
had
in
his
service
as
steward
honoré
grégoire
a
picardy
lad
the
of
léon
grégoire
cécile
father
when
the
montsou
treaty
was
made
honoré
who
had
laid
up
savings
to
the
amount
of
some
fifty
thousand
francs
yielded
tremblingly
to
his
master
unshakable
faith
he
took
out
ten
thousand
francs
in
fine
crowns
and
took
a
denier
though
with
the
fear
of
robbing
his
children
of
that
sum
his
son
eugéne
in
fact
received
very
small
dividends
and
as
he
had
become
a
bourgeois
and
had
been
foolish
enough
to
throw
away
the
other
forty
thousand
francs
of
the
paternal
inheritance
in
a
company
that
came
to
grief
he
lived
meanly
enough
but
the
interest
of
the
denier
gradually
increased
the
fortune
began
with
félicien
who
was
able
to
realize
a
dream
with
which
his
grandfather
the
old
steward
had
nursed
his
childhood
the
purchase
of
dismembered
piolaine
which
he
acquired
as
national
property
for
a
ludicrous
sum
however
bad
years
followed
it
was
necessary
to
await
the
conclusion
of
the
revolutionary
catastrophes
and
afterwards
napoleon
bloody
fall
and
it
was
léon
grégoire
who
profited
at
a
stupefying
rate
of
progress
by
the
timid
and
uneasy
investment
of
his
those
poor
ten
thousand
francs
grew
and
multiplied
with
the
company
prosperity
from
they
had
brought
in
one
hundred
per
cent
ten
thousand
francs
in
they
had
produced
twenty
thousand
in
forty
during
two
years
the
dividend
had
reached
the
prodigious
figure
of
fifty
thousand
francs
the
value
of
the
denier
quoted
at
the
lille
bourse
at
a
million
had
centupled
in
a
century
grégoire
who
had
been
advised
to
sell
out
when
this
figure
of
a
million
was
reached
had
refused
with
his
smiling
paternal
air
six
months
later
an
industrial
crisis
broke
out
the
denier
fell
to
six
hundred
thousand
francs
but
he
still
smiled
he
regretted
nothing
for
the
grégoires
had
maintained
an
obstinate
faith
in
their
mine
it
would
rise
again
god
himself
was
not
so
solid
then
with
his
religious
faith
was
mixed
profound
gratitude
towards
an
investment
which
for
a
century
had
supported
the
family
in
doing
nothing
it
was
like
a
divinity
of
their
own
whom
their
egoism
surrounded
with
a
kind
of
worship
the
benefactor
of
the
hearth
lulling
them
in
their
great
bed
of
idleness
fattening
them
at
their
gluttonous
table
from
father
to
son
it
had
gone
on
why
risk
displeasing
fate
by
doubting
it
and
at
the
bottom
of
their
fidelity
there
was
a
superstitious
terror
a
fear
lest
the
million
of
the
denier
might
suddenly
melt
away
if
they
were
to
realize
it
and
to
put
it
in
a
drawer
it
seemed
to
them
more
sheltered
in
the
earth
from
which
a
race
of
miners
generations
of
starving
people
extracted
it
for
them
a
little
every
day
as
they
needed
it
for
the
rest
happiness
rained
on
this
house
grégoire
when
very
young
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
marchiennes
druggist
a
plain
penniless
girl
whom
he
adored
and
who
repaid
him
with
happiness
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
household
and
worshipped
her
husband
having
no
other
will
but
his
no
difference
of
tastes
separated
them
their
desires
were
mingled
in
one
idea
of
comfort
and
they
had
thus
lived
for
forty
years
in
affection
and
little
mutual
services
it
was
a
existence
the
forty
thousand
francs
were
spent
quietly
and
the
savings
expended
on
cécile
whose
tardy
birth
had
for
a
moment
disturbed
the
budget
they
still
satisfied
all
her
whims
a
second
horse
two
more
carriages
toilets
sent
from
paris
but
they
tasted
in
this
one
more
joy
they
thought
nothing
too
good
for
their
daughter
although
they
had
such
a
horror
of
display
that
they
had
preserved
the
fashions
of
their
youth
every
unprofitable
expense
seemed
foolish
to
them
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
a
loud
voice
called
out
hallo
what
now
having
breakfast
without
me
it
was
cécile
just
come
from
her
bed
her
eyes
heavy
with
sleep
she
had
simply
put
up
her
hair
and
flung
on
a
white
woollen
no
no
said
the
mother
you
see
we
are
all
waiting
eh
has
the
wind
prevented
you
from
sleeping
poor
darling
the
young
girl
looked
at
her
in
great
surprise
has
it
been
windy
i
did
know
anything
about
it
i
have
moved
all
night
then
they
thought
this
funny
and
all
three
began
to
laugh
the
servants
who
were
bringing
in
the
breakfast
also
broke
out
laughing
so
amused
was
the
household
at
the
idea
that
mademoiselle
had
been
sleeping
for
twelve
hours
right
off
the
sight
of
the
brioche
completed
the
expansion
of
their
faces
what
is
it
cooked
then
said
cécile
that
must
be
a
surprise
for
me
that
be
good
now
hot
with
the
chocolate
they
sat
down
to
table
at
last
with
the
smoking
chocolate
in
their
cups
and
for
a
long
time
talked
of
nothing
but
the
brioche
mélanie
and
honorine
remained
to
give
details
about
the
cooking
and
watched
them
stuffing
themselves
with
greasy
lips
saying
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
make
a
cake
when
one
saw
the
masters
enjoying
it
so
much
but
the
dogs
began
to
bark
loudly
perhaps
they
announced
the
music
mistress
who
came
from
marchiennes
on
mondays
and
fridays
a
professor
of
literature
also
came
all
the
young
girl
education
was
thus
carried
on
at
piolaine
in
happy
ignorance
with
her
childish
whims
throwing
the
book
out
of
the
window
as
soon
as
anything
wearied
her
it
is
deneulin
said
honorine
returning
behind
her
deneulin
a
cousin
of
grégoire
appeared
without
ceremony
with
his
loud
voice
his
quick
gestures
he
had
the
appearance
of
an
old
cavalry
officer
although
over
fifty
his
short
hair
and
thick
moustache
were
as
black
as
ink
yes
it
is
i
good
day
do
disturb
yourselves
he
had
sat
down
amid
the
family
exclamations
they
turned
back
at
last
to
their
chocolate
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
asked
grégoire
no
nothing
at
all
deneulin
hastened
to
reply
i
came
out
on
horseback
to
rub
off
the
rust
a
bit
and
as
i
passed
your
door
i
thought
i
would
just
look
in
cécile
questioned
him
about
jeanne
and
lucie
his
daughters
they
were
perfectly
well
the
first
was
always
at
her
painting
while
the
other
the
elder
was
training
her
voice
at
the
piano
from
morning
till
night
and
there
was
a
slight
quiver
in
his
voice
a
disquiet
which
he
concealed
beneath
bursts
of
gaiety
grégoire
began
again
and
everything
goes
well
at
the
pit
well
i
am
upset
over
this
dirty
crisis
ah
we
are
paying
for
the
prosperous
years
they
have
built
too
many
workshops
put
down
too
many
railways
invested
too
much
capital
with
a
view
to
a
large
return
and
today
the
money
is
asleep
they
ca
get
any
more
to
make
the
whole
thing
work
luckily
things
are
not
desperate
i
shall
get
out
of
it
somehow
like
his
cousin
he
had
inherited
a
denier
in
the
montsou
mines
but
being
an
enterprising
engineer
tormented
by
the
desire
for
a
royal
fortune
he
had
hastened
to
sell
out
when
the
denier
had
reached
a
million
for
some
months
he
had
been
maturing
a
scheme
his
wife
possessed
through
an
uncle
the
little
concession
of
vandame
where
only
two
pits
were
open
and
in
an
abandoned
state
and
with
such
defective
material
that
the
output
hardly
covered
the
cost
now
he
was
meditating
the
repair
of
the
renewal
of
the
engine
and
the
enlargement
of
the
shaft
so
as
to
facilitate
the
descent
keeping
only
for
exhaustion
purposes
they
ought
to
be
able
to
shovel
up
gold
there
he
said
the
idea
was
sound
only
the
million
had
been
spent
over
it
and
this
damnable
industrial
crisis
broke
out
at
the
moment
when
large
profits
would
have
shown
that
he
was
right
besides
he
was
a
bad
manager
with
a
rough
kindness
towards
his
workmen
and
since
his
wife
death
he
allowed
himself
to
be
pillaged
and
also
gave
the
rein
to
his
daughters
the
elder
of
whom
talked
of
going
on
the
stage
while
the
younger
had
already
had
three
landscapes
refused
at
the
salon
both
of
them
joyous
amid
the
downfall
and
exhibiting
in
poverty
their
capacity
for
good
household
management
you
see
léon
he
went
on
in
a
hesitating
voice
you
were
wrong
not
to
sell
out
at
the
same
time
as
i
did
now
everything
is
going
down
you
run
risk
and
if
you
had
confided
your
money
to
me
you
would
have
seen
what
we
should
have
done
at
vandame
in
our
mine
grégoire
finished
his
chocolate
without
haste
he
replied
peacefully
never
you
know
that
i
do
want
to
speculate
i
live
quietly
and
it
would
be
too
foolish
to
worry
my
head
over
business
affairs
and
as
for
montsou
it
may
continue
to
go
down
we
shall
always
get
our
living
out
of
it
it
does
do
to
be
so
diabolically
greedy
then
listen
it
is
you
who
will
bite
your
fingers
one
day
for
montsou
will
rise
again
and
cécile
grandchildren
will
still
get
their
white
bread
out
of
it
deneulin
listened
with
a
constrained
smile
then
he
murmured
if
i
were
to
ask
you
to
put
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
my
affair
you
would
refuse
but
seeing
the
grégoires
disturbed
faces
he
regretted
having
gone
so
far
he
put
off
his
idea
of
a
loan
reserving
it
until
the
case
was
desperate
oh
i
have
not
got
to
that
it
is
a
joke
good
heavens
perhaps
you
are
right
the
money
that
other
people
earn
for
you
is
the
best
to
fatten
on
they
changed
the
conversation
cécile
spoke
again
of
her
cousins
whose
tastes
interested
while
at
the
same
time
they
shocked
her
madame
grégoire
promised
to
take
her
daughter
to
see
those
dear
little
ones
on
the
first
fine
day
grégoire
however
with
a
distracted
air
did
not
follow
the
conversation
he
added
aloud
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
persist
any
more
i
would
treat
with
montsou
they
want
it
and
you
will
get
your
money
back
he
alluded
to
an
old
hatred
which
existed
between
the
concession
of
montsou
and
that
of
vandame
in
spite
of
the
latter
slight
importance
its
powerful
neighbour
was
enraged
at
seeing
enclosed
within
its
own
communes
this
square
league
which
did
not
belong
to
it
and
after
having
vainly
tried
to
kill
it
had
plotted
to
buy
it
at
a
low
price
when
in
a
failing
condition
the
war
continued
without
truce
each
party
stopped
its
galleries
at
two
hundred
metres
from
the
other
it
was
a
duel
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
although
the
managers
and
engineers
maintained
polite
relations
with
each
other
deneulin
eyes
had
flamed
up
never
he
cried
in
his
turn
montsou
shall
never
have
vandame
as
long
as
i
am
alive
i
dined
on
thursday
at
hennebeau
and
i
saw
him
fluttering
around
me
last
autumn
when
the
big
men
came
to
the
administration
building
they
made
me
all
sorts
of
advances
yes
yes
i
know
them
those
marquises
and
dukes
and
generals
and
ministers
brigands
who
would
take
away
even
your
shirt
at
the
corner
of
a
wood
he
could
not
cease
besides
grégoire
did
not
defend
the
administration
of
montsou
the
six
stewards
established
by
the
treaty
of
who
governed
the
company
despotically
and
the
five
survivors
of
whom
on
every
death
chose
the
new
member
among
the
powerful
and
rich
shareholders
the
opinion
of
the
owner
of
piolaine
with
his
reasonable
ideas
was
that
these
gentlemen
were
sometimes
rather
immoderate
in
their
exaggerated
love
of
money
mélanie
had
come
to
clear
away
the
table
outside
the
dogs
were
again
barking
and
honorine
was
going
to
the
door
when
cécile
who
was
stifled
by
heat
and
food
left
the
table
no
never
mind
it
must
be
for
my
lesson
deneulin
had
also
risen
he
watched
the
young
girl
go
out
and
asked
smiling
well
and
the
marriage
with
little
négrel
nothing
has
been
settled
said
madame
grégoire
it
is
only
an
idea
we
must
reflect
no
doubt
he
went
on
with
a
gay
laugh
i
believe
that
the
nephew
and
the
aunt
what
baffles
me
is
that
madame
hennebeau
should
throw
herself
so
on
cécile
neck
but
grégoire
was
indignant
so
distinguished
a
lady
and
fourteen
years
older
than
the
young
man
it
was
monstrous
he
did
not
like
joking
on
such
subjects
deneulin
still
laughing
shook
hands
with
him
and
left
not
yet
said
cécile
coming
back
it
is
that
woman
with
the
two
children
you
know
mamma
the
miner
wife
whom
we
met
are
they
to
come
in
here
they
hesitated
were
they
very
dirty
no
not
very
and
they
would
leave
their
sabots
in
the
porch
already
the
father
and
mother
had
stretched
themselves
out
in
the
depths
of
their
large
they
were
digesting
there
the
fear
of
change
of
air
decided
them
let
them
come
in
honorine
then
maheude
and
her
little
ones
entered
frozen
and
hungry
seized
by
fright
on
finding
themselves
in
this
room
which
was
so
warm
and
smelled
so
nicely
of
the
brioche
chapter
ii
the
room
remained
shut
up
and
the
shutters
had
allowed
gradual
streaks
of
daylight
to
form
a
fan
on
the
ceiling
the
confined
air
stupefied
them
so
that
they
continued
their
night
slumber
lénore
and
henri
in
each
other
arms
alzire
with
her
head
back
lying
on
her
hump
while
father
bonnemort
having
the
bed
of
zacharie
and
jeanlin
to
himself
snored
with
open
mouth
no
sound
came
from
the
closet
where
maheude
had
gone
to
sleep
again
while
suckling
estelle
her
breast
hanging
to
one
side
the
child
lying
across
her
belly
stuffed
with
milk
overcome
also
and
stifling
in
the
soft
flesh
of
the
bosom
the
clock
below
struck
six
along
the
front
of
the
settlement
one
heard
the
sound
of
doors
then
the
clatter
of
sabots
along
the
pavements
the
screening
women
were
going
to
the
pit
and
silence
again
fell
until
seven
then
shutters
were
drawn
back
yawns
and
coughs
were
heard
through
the
walls
for
a
long
time
a
scraped
but
no
one
awoke
in
the
room
suddenly
a
sound
of
blows
and
shouts
far
away
made
alzire
sit
up
she
was
conscious
of
the
time
and
ran
barefooted
to
shake
her
mother
mother
mother
it
is
late
you
have
to
go
out
take
care
you
are
crushing
estelle
and
she
saved
the
child
beneath
the
enormous
mass
of
the
breasts
good
gracious
stammered
maheude
rubbing
her
eyes
i
so
knocked
up
i
could
sleep
all
day
dress
lénore
and
henri
i
take
them
with
me
and
you
can
take
care
of
estelle
i
do
want
to
drag
her
along
for
fear
of
hurting
her
this
dog
weather
she
hastily
washed
herself
and
put
on
an
old
blue
skirt
her
cleanest
and
a
loose
jacket
of
grey
wool
in
which
she
had
made
two
patches
the
evening
before
and
the
soup
good
gracious
she
muttered
again
when
her
mother
had
gone
down
upsetting
everything
alzire
went
back
into
the
room
taking
with
her
estelle
who
had
begun
screaming
but
she
was
used
to
the
little
one
rages
at
eight
she
had
all
a
tender
cunning
in
soothing
and
amusing
her
she
gently
placed
her
in
her
still
warm
bed
and
put
her
to
sleep
again
giving
her
a
finger
to
suck
it
was
time
for
now
another
disturbance
broke
out
and
she
had
to
make
peace
between
lénore
and
henri
who
at
last
awoke
these
children
could
never
get
on
together
it
was
only
when
they
were
asleep
that
they
put
their
arms
round
one
another
necks
the
girl
who
was
six
years
old
as
soon
as
she
was
awake
set
on
the
boy
her
junior
by
two
years
who
received
her
blows
without
returning
them
both
of
them
had
the
same
kind
of
head
which
was
too
large
for
them
as
if
blown
out
with
disorderly
yellow
hair
alzire
had
to
pull
her
sister
by
the
legs
threatening
to
take
the
skin
off
her
bottom
then
there
was
stamping
over
the
washing
and
over
every
garment
that
she
put
on
to
them
the
shutters
remained
closed
so
as
not
to
disturb
father
bonnemort
sleep
he
went
on
snoring
amid
the
children
frightful
clatter
it
ready
are
you
coming
up
there
shouted
maheude
she
had
put
back
the
blinds
and
stirred
up
the
fire
adding
some
coal
to
it
her
hope
was
that
the
old
man
had
not
swallowed
all
the
soup
but
she
found
the
saucepan
dry
and
cooked
a
handful
of
vermicelli
which
she
had
been
keeping
for
three
days
in
reserve
they
could
swallow
it
with
water
without
butter
as
there
could
not
be
any
remaining
from
the
day
before
and
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
catherine
in
preparing
the
bricks
had
performed
the
miracle
of
leaving
a
piece
as
large
as
a
nut
but
this
time
the
cupboard
was
indeed
empty
nothing
not
a
crust
not
an
odd
fragment
not
a
bone
to
gnaw
what
was
to
become
of
them
if
maigrat
persisted
in
cutting
short
their
credit
and
if
the
piolaine
people
would
not
give
them
the
five
francs
when
the
men
and
the
girl
returned
from
the
pit
they
would
want
to
eat
for
unfortunately
it
had
not
yet
been
found
out
how
to
live
without
eating
come
down
will
you
she
cried
out
getting
angry
i
ought
to
be
gone
by
this
when
alzire
and
the
children
were
there
she
divided
the
vermicelli
in
three
small
portions
she
herself
was
not
hungry
she
said
although
catherine
had
already
poured
water
on
the
of
the
day
before
she
did
so
over
again
and
swallowed
two
large
glasses
of
coffee
so
weak
that
it
looked
like
rusty
water
that
would
keep
her
up
all
the
same
listen
she
repeated
to
alzire
you
must
let
your
grandfather
sleep
you
must
watch
that
estelle
does
not
knock
her
head
and
if
she
wakes
or
if
she
howls
too
much
here
take
this
bit
of
sugar
and
melt
it
and
give
it
her
in
spoonfuls
i
know
that
you
are
sensible
and
wo
eat
it
yourself
and
school
mother
school
well
that
must
be
left
for
another
day
i
want
you
and
the
soup
would
you
like
me
to
make
it
if
you
come
back
late
soup
soup
no
wait
till
i
come
alzire
with
the
precocious
intelligence
of
a
little
invalid
girl
could
make
soup
very
well
she
must
have
understood
for
she
did
not
insist
now
the
whole
settlement
was
awake
bands
of
children
were
going
to
school
and
one
heard
the
trailing
noise
of
their
clogs
eight
struck
and
a
growing
murmur
of
chatter
arose
on
the
left
among
the
levaque
people
the
women
were
commencing
their
day
around
the
with
their
fists
on
their
hips
their
tongues
turning
without
ceasing
like
millstones
a
faded
head
with
thick
lips
and
flattened
nose
was
pressed
against
a
calling
out
got
some
news
stop
a
bit
no
no
later
on
replied
maheude
i
have
to
go
out
and
for
fear
of
giving
way
to
the
offer
of
a
glass
of
hot
coffee
she
pushed
lénore
and
henri
and
set
out
with
them
up
above
father
bonnemort
was
still
snoring
with
a
rhythmic
snore
which
rocked
the
house
outside
maheude
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
wind
was
no
longer
blowing
there
had
been
a
sudden
thaw
the
sky
was
the
walls
were
sticky
with
greenish
moisture
and
the
roads
were
covered
with
mud
a
special
kind
of
mud
peculiar
to
the
coal
country
as
black
as
diluted
soot
thick
and
tenacious
enough
to
pull
off
her
sabots
suddenly
she
boxed
lénore
ears
because
the
little
one
amused
herself
by
piling
the
mud
on
her
clogs
as
on
the
end
of
a
shovel
on
leaving
the
settlement
she
had
gone
along
by
the
and
followed
the
road
of
the
canal
making
a
short
cut
through
paths
across
rough
country
shut
in
by
mossy
palings
sheds
succeeded
one
another
long
workshop
buildings
tall
chimneys
spitting
out
soot
and
soiling
this
ravaged
suburb
of
an
industrial
district
behind
a
clump
of
poplars
the
old
réquillart
pit
exhibited
its
crumbling
steeple
of
which
the
large
skeleton
alone
stood
upright
and
turning
to
the
right
maheude
found
herself
on
the
high
road
stop
stop
dirty
pig
i
teach
you
to
make
mincemeat
now
it
was
henri
who
had
taken
a
handful
of
mud
and
was
moulding
it
the
two
children
had
their
ears
impartially
boxed
and
were
brought
into
good
order
looking
out
of
the
corner
of
their
eyes
at
the
mud
pies
they
had
made
they
draggled
along
already
exhausted
by
their
efforts
to
unstick
their
shoes
at
every
step
on
the
marchiennes
side
the
road
unrolled
its
two
leagues
of
pavement
which
stretched
straight
as
a
ribbon
soaked
in
cart
grease
between
the
reddish
fields
but
on
the
other
side
it
went
winding
down
through
montsou
which
was
built
on
the
slope
of
a
large
undulation
in
the
plain
these
roads
in
the
nord
drawn
like
a
string
between
manufacturing
towns
with
their
slight
curves
their
slow
ascents
gradually
get
lined
with
houses
and
tend
to
make
the
department
one
laborious
city
the
little
brick
houses
daubed
over
to
enliven
the
climate
some
yellow
others
blue
others
black
the
last
no
doubt
in
order
to
reach
at
once
their
final
shade
went
serpentining
down
to
right
and
to
left
to
the
bottom
of
the
slope
a
few
large
villas
the
dwellings
of
the
heads
of
the
workshops
made
gaps
in
the
serried
line
of
narrow
facades
a
church
also
of
brick
looked
like
a
new
model
of
a
large
furnace
with
its
square
tower
already
stained
by
the
floating
coal
dust
and
amid
the
sugar
works
the
rope
works
and
the
flour
mills
there
stood
out
ballrooms
restaurants
and
beershops
which
were
so
numerous
that
to
every
thousand
houses
there
were
more
than
five
hundred
inns
as
she
approached
the
company
yards
a
vast
series
of
storehouses
and
workshops
maheude
decided
to
take
henri
and
lénore
by
the
hand
one
on
the
right
the
other
on
the
left
beyond
was
situated
the
house
of
the
director
hennebeau
a
sort
of
vast
chalet
separated
from
the
road
by
a
grating
and
then
a
garden
in
which
some
lean
trees
vegetated
just
then
a
carriage
had
stopped
before
the
door
and
a
gentleman
with
decorations
and
a
lady
in
a
fur
cloak
alighted
visitors
just
arrived
from
paris
at
the
marchiennes
station
for
madame
hennebeau
who
appeared
in
the
shadow
of
the
porch
was
uttering
exclamations
of
surprise
and
joy
come
along
then
dawdlers
growled
maheude
pulling
the
two
little
ones
who
were
standing
in
the
mud
when
she
arrived
at
maigrat
she
was
quite
excited
maigrat
lived
close
to
the
manager
only
a
wall
separated
the
latter
ground
from
his
own
small
house
and
he
had
there
a
warehouse
a
long
building
which
opened
on
to
the
road
as
a
shop
without
a
front
he
kept
everything
there
grocery
cooked
meats
fruit
and
sold
bread
beer
and
saucepans
formerly
an
overseer
at
the
voreux
he
had
started
with
a
small
canteen
then
thanks
to
the
protection
of
his
superiors
his
business
had
enlarged
gradually
killing
the
montsou
retail
trade
he
centralized
merchandise
and
the
considerable
custom
of
the
settlements
enabled
him
to
sell
more
cheaply
and
to
give
longer
credit
besides
he
had
remained
in
the
company
hands
and
they
had
built
his
small
house
and
his
shop
here
i
am
again
monsieur
maigrat
said
maheude
humbly
finding
him
standing
in
front
of
his
door
he
looked
at
her
without
replying
he
was
a
stout
cold
polite
man
and
he
prided
himself
on
never
changing
his
mind
now
you
wo
send
me
away
again
like
yesterday
we
must
have
bread
from
now
to
saturday
sure
enough
we
owe
you
sixty
francs
these
two
years
she
explained
in
short
painful
phrases
it
was
an
old
debt
contracted
during
the
last
strike
twenty
times
over
they
had
promised
to
settle
it
but
they
had
not
been
able
they
could
not
even
give
him
forty
sous
a
fortnight
and
then
a
misfortune
had
happened
two
days
before
she
had
been
obliged
to
pay
twenty
francs
to
a
shoemaker
who
threatened
to
seize
their
things
and
that
was
why
they
were
without
a
sou
otherwise
they
would
have
been
able
to
go
on
until
saturday
like
the
others
maigrat
with
protruded
belly
and
folded
arms
shook
his
head
at
every
supplication
only
two
loaves
monsieur
maigrat
i
am
reasonable
i
do
ask
for
coffee
only
two
loaves
a
day
no
he
shouted
at
last
at
the
top
of
his
voice
his
wife
had
appeared
a
pitiful
creature
who
passed
all
her
days
over
a
ledger
without
even
daring
to
lift
her
head
she
moved
away
frightened
at
seeing
this
unfortunate
woman
turning
her
ardent
beseeching
eyes
towards
her
it
was
said
that
she
yielded
the
conjugal
bed
to
the
putters
among
the
customers
it
was
a
known
fact
that
when
a
miner
wished
to
prolong
his
credit
he
had
only
to
send
his
daughter
or
his
wife
plain
or
pretty
it
mattered
not
provided
they
were
complaisant
maheude
still
imploring
maigrat
with
her
look
felt
herself
uncomfortable
under
the
pale
keenness
of
his
small
eyes
which
seemed
to
undress
her
it
made
her
angry
she
would
have
understood
before
she
had
had
seven
children
when
she
was
young
and
she
went
off
violently
dragging
lénore
and
henri
who
were
occupied
in
picking
up
from
the
gutter
where
they
were
making
investigations
this
wo
bring
you
luck
monsieur
maigrat
remember
now
there
only
remained
the
piolaine
people
if
these
would
not
throw
her
a
piece
she
might
as
well
lie
down
and
die
she
had
taken
the
joiselle
road
on
the
left
the
administration
building
was
there
at
the
corner
of
the
road
a
veritable
brick
palace
where
the
great
people
from
paris
princes
and
generals
and
members
of
the
government
came
every
autumn
to
give
large
dinners
as
she
walked
she
was
already
spending
the
five
francs
first
bread
then
coffee
afterwards
a
quarter
of
butter
a
bushel
of
potatoes
for
the
morning
soup
and
the
evening
stew
finally
perhaps
a
bit
of
chitterlings
for
the
father
needed
meat
the
curé
of
montsou
abbé
joire
was
passing
holding
up
his
cassock
with
the
delicate
air
of
a
fat
cat
afraid
of
wetting
its
fur
he
was
a
mild
man
who
pretended
not
to
interest
himself
in
anything
so
as
not
to
vex
either
the
workers
or
the
masters
good
day
monsieur
le
curé
without
stopping
he
smiled
at
the
children
and
left
her
planted
in
the
middle
of
the
road
she
was
not
religious
but
she
had
suddenly
imagined
that
this
priest
would
give
her
something
and
the
journey
began
again
through
the
black
sticky
mud
there
were
still
two
kilometres
to
walk
and
the
little
ones
dragged
behind
more
than
ever
for
they
were
frightened
and
no
longer
amused
themselves
to
right
and
to
left
of
the
path
the
same
vague
landscape
unrolled
enclosed
within
mossy
palings
the
same
factory
buildings
dirty
with
smoke
bristling
with
tall
chimneys
then
the
flat
land
was
spread
out
in
immense
open
fields
like
an
ocean
of
brown
clods
without
a
as
far
as
the
purplish
line
of
the
forest
of
vandame
carry
me
mother
she
carried
them
one
after
the
other
puddles
made
holes
in
the
pathway
and
she
pulled
up
her
clothes
fearful
of
arriving
too
dirty
three
times
she
nearly
fell
so
sticky
was
that
confounded
pavement
and
as
they
at
last
arrived
before
the
porch
two
enormous
dogs
threw
themselves
upon
them
barking
so
loudly
that
the
little
ones
yelled
with
terror
the
coachman
was
obliged
to
take
a
whip
to
them
leave
your
sabots
and
come
in
repeated
honorine
in
the
the
mother
and
children
stood
motionless
dazed
by
the
sudden
heat
and
very
constrained
beneath
the
gaze
of
this
old
lady
and
gentleman
who
were
stretched
out
in
their
cécile
said
the
old
lady
fulfil
your
little
duties
the
grégoires
charged
cécile
with
their
charities
it
was
part
of
their
idea
of
a
good
education
one
must
be
charitable
they
said
themselves
that
their
house
was
the
house
of
god
besides
they
flattered
themselves
that
they
performed
their
charity
with
intelligence
and
they
were
exercised
by
a
constant
fear
lest
they
should
be
deceived
and
so
encourage
vice
so
they
never
gave
money
never
not
ten
sous
not
two
sous
for
it
is
a
fact
that
as
soon
as
a
poor
man
gets
two
sous
he
drinks
them
their
alms
were
therefore
always
in
kind
especially
in
warm
clothing
distributed
during
the
winter
to
needy
children
oh
the
poor
dears
exclaimed
cécile
how
pale
they
are
from
the
cold
honorine
go
and
look
for
the
parcel
in
the
cupboard
the
servants
were
also
gazing
at
these
miserable
creatures
with
the
pity
and
vague
uneasiness
of
girls
who
are
in
no
difficulty
about
their
own
dinners
while
the
housemaid
went
upstairs
the
cook
forgot
her
duties
leaving
the
rest
of
the
brioche
on
the
table
and
stood
there
swinging
her
empty
hands
i
still
have
two
woollen
dresses
and
some
comforters
cécile
went
on
you
will
see
how
warm
they
will
be
the
poor
dears
then
maheude
found
her
tongue
and
stammered
thank
you
so
much
mademoiselle
you
are
all
too
good
tears
had
filled
her
eyes
she
thought
herself
sure
of
the
five
francs
and
was
only
preoccupied
by
the
way
in
which
she
would
ask
for
them
if
they
were
not
offered
to
her
the
housemaid
did
not
reappear
and
there
was
a
moment
of
embarrassed
silence
from
their
mother
skirts
the
little
ones
opened
their
eyes
wide
and
gazed
at
the
brioche
you
only
have
these
two
asked
madame
grégoire
in
order
to
break
the
silence
oh
madame
i
have
seven
grégoire
who
had
gone
back
to
his
newspaper
sat
up
indignantly
seven
children
but
why
good
god
it
is
imprudent
murmured
the
old
lady
maheude
made
a
vague
gesture
of
apology
what
would
you
have
one
does
think
about
it
at
all
they
come
quite
naturally
and
then
when
they
grow
up
they
bring
something
in
and
that
makes
the
household
go
take
their
case
they
could
get
on
if
it
was
not
for
the
grandfather
who
was
getting
quite
stiff
and
if
it
was
not
that
among
the
lot
only
two
of
her
sons
and
her
eldest
daughter
were
old
enough
to
go
down
into
the
pit
it
was
necessary
all
the
same
to
feed
the
little
ones
who
brought
nothing
in
then
said
madame
grégoire
you
have
worked
for
a
long
time
at
the
mines
a
silent
laugh
lit
up
maheude
pale
face
ah
yes
ah
yes
i
went
down
till
i
was
twenty
the
doctor
said
that
i
should
stay
down
for
good
after
i
had
been
confined
the
second
time
because
it
seems
that
made
something
go
wrong
in
my
inside
besides
then
i
got
married
and
i
had
enough
to
do
in
the
house
but
on
my
husband
side
you
see
they
have
been
down
there
for
ages
it
goes
up
from
grandfather
to
grandfather
one
does
know
how
far
back
quite
to
the
beginning
when
they
first
took
the
pick
down
there
at
réquillart
grégoire
thoughtfully
contemplated
this
woman
and
these
pitiful
children
with
their
waxy
flesh
their
discoloured
hair
the
degeneration
which
stunted
them
gnawed
by
anaemia
and
with
the
melancholy
ugliness
of
starvelings
there
was
silence
again
and
one
only
heard
the
burning
coal
as
it
gave
out
a
jet
of
gas
the
moist
room
had
that
heavy
air
of
comfort
in
which
our
nooks
of
happiness
slumber
what
is
she
doing
then
exclaimed
cécile
impatiently
mélanie
go
up
and
tell
her
that
the
parcel
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
cupboard
on
the
left
in
the
meanwhile
grégoire
repeated
aloud
the
reflections
inspired
by
the
sight
of
these
starving
ones
there
is
evil
in
this
world
it
is
quite
true
but
my
good
woman
it
must
also
be
said
that
workpeople
are
never
prudent
thus
instead
of
putting
aside
a
few
sous
like
our
peasants
miners
drink
get
into
debt
and
end
by
not
having
enough
to
support
their
families
monsieur
is
right
replied
maheude
sturdily
they
do
always
keep
to
the
right
path
that
what
i
always
saying
to
the
when
they
complain
now
i
have
been
lucky
my
husband
does
drink
all
the
same
on
feast
sundays
he
sometimes
takes
a
drop
too
much
but
it
never
goes
farther
it
is
all
the
nicer
of
him
since
before
our
marriage
he
drank
like
a
hog
begging
your
pardon
and
yet
you
know
it
does
help
us
much
that
he
is
so
sensible
there
are
days
like
when
you
might
turn
out
all
the
drawers
in
the
house
and
not
find
a
farthing
she
wished
to
suggest
to
them
the
idea
of
the
piece
and
went
on
in
her
low
voice
explaining
the
fatal
debt
small
at
first
then
large
and
overwhelming
they
paid
regularly
for
many
fortnights
but
one
day
they
got
behind
and
then
it
was
all
up
they
could
never
catch
up
again
the
gulf
widened
and
the
men
became
disgusted
with
work
which
did
not
even
allow
them
to
pay
their
way
do
what
they
could
there
was
nothing
but
difficulties
until
death
besides
it
must
be
understood
that
a
collier
needed
a
glass
to
wash
away
the
dust
it
began
there
and
then
he
was
always
in
the
inn
when
worries
came
without
complaining
of
any
one
it
might
be
that
the
workmen
did
not
earn
as
much
as
they
ought
to
i
thought
said
madame
grégoire
that
the
company
gave
you
lodging
and
firing
maheude
glanced
sideways
at
the
flaming
coal
in
the
fireplace
yes
yes
they
give
us
coal
not
very
grand
but
it
burns
as
to
lodging
it
only
costs
six
francs
a
month
that
sounds
like
nothing
but
it
is
often
pretty
hard
to
pay
they
might
cut
me
up
into
bits
without
getting
two
sous
out
of
me
where
there
nothing
nothing
the
lady
and
gentleman
were
silent
softly
stretched
out
and
gradually
wearied
and
disquieted
by
the
exhibition
of
this
wretchedness
she
feared
she
had
wounded
them
and
added
with
the
stolid
and
just
air
of
a
practical
woman
oh
i
did
want
to
complain
things
are
like
this
and
one
has
to
put
up
with
them
all
the
more
that
it
no
good
struggling
perhaps
we
should
change
anything
the
best
is
is
it
not
to
try
and
live
honestly
in
the
place
in
which
the
good
god
has
put
us
grégoire
approved
this
emphatically
with
such
sentiments
my
good
woman
one
is
above
misfortune
honorine
and
mélanie
at
last
brought
the
parcel
cécile
unfastened
it
and
took
out
the
two
dresses
she
added
comforters
even
stockings
and
mittens
they
would
all
fit
beautifully
she
hastened
and
made
the
servants
wrap
up
the
chosen
garments
for
her
music
mistress
had
just
arrived
and
she
pushed
the
mother
and
children
towards
the
door
we
are
very
short
stammered
maheude
if
we
only
had
a
piece
the
phrase
was
stifled
for
the
maheus
were
proud
and
never
begged
cécile
looked
uneasily
at
her
father
but
the
latter
refused
decisively
with
an
air
of
duty
no
it
is
not
our
custom
we
can
not
do
it
then
the
young
girl
moved
by
the
mother
overwhelmed
face
wished
to
do
all
she
could
for
the
children
they
were
still
looking
fixedly
at
the
brioche
she
cut
it
in
two
and
gave
it
to
them
here
this
is
for
you
then
taking
the
pieces
back
she
asked
for
an
old
newspaper
wait
you
must
share
with
your
brothers
and
sisters
and
beneath
the
tender
gaze
of
her
parents
she
finally
pushed
them
out
of
the
room
the
poor
starving
urchins
went
off
holding
the
brioche
respectfully
in
their
benumbed
little
hands
maheude
dragged
her
children
along
the
road
seeing
neither
the
desert
fields
nor
the
black
mud
nor
the
great
livid
sky
as
she
passed
through
montsou
she
resolutely
entered
maigrat
shop
and
begged
so
persistently
that
at
last
she
carried
away
two
loaves
coffee
butter
and
even
her
piece
for
the
man
also
lent
money
by
the
week
it
was
not
her
that
he
wanted
it
was
catherine
she
understood
that
when
he
advised
her
to
send
her
daughter
for
provisions
they
would
see
about
that
catherine
would
box
his
ears
if
he
came
too
close
under
her
nose
chapter
iii
eleven
struck
at
the
little
church
in
the
settlement
a
brick
chapel
to
which
abbé
joire
came
to
say
mass
on
sundays
in
the
school
beside
it
also
of
brick
one
heard
the
faltering
voices
of
the
children
in
spite
of
windows
closed
against
the
outside
cold
the
wide
passages
divided
into
little
gardens
back
to
back
between
the
four
large
blocks
of
uniform
houses
were
deserted
and
these
gardens
devastated
by
the
winter
exhibited
the
destitution
of
their
marly
soil
lumped
and
spotted
by
the
last
vegetables
they
were
making
soup
chimneys
were
smoking
a
woman
appeared
at
distant
intervals
along
the
fronts
opened
a
door
and
disappeared
from
one
end
to
the
other
on
the
pavement
the
pipes
dripped
into
tubs
although
it
was
no
longer
raining
so
charged
was
this
grey
sky
with
moistness
and
the
village
built
altogether
in
the
midst
of
the
vast
plain
and
edged
by
its
black
roads
as
by
a
mourning
border
had
no
touch
of
joyousness
about
it
save
the
regular
bands
of
its
red
tiles
constantly
washed
by
showers
when
maheude
returned
she
went
out
of
her
way
to
buy
potatoes
from
an
overseer
wife
whose
crop
was
not
yet
exhausted
behind
a
curtain
of
sickly
poplars
the
only
trees
in
these
flat
regions
was
a
group
of
isolated
buildings
houses
placed
four
together
and
surrounded
by
their
gardens
as
the
company
reserved
this
new
experiment
for
the
captains
the
workpeople
called
this
corner
of
the
hamlet
the
settlement
of
the
just
as
they
called
their
own
settlement
in
irony
of
their
wretchedness
eh
here
we
are
said
maheude
laden
with
parcels
pushing
in
lénore
and
henri
covered
with
mud
and
quite
tired
out
in
front
of
the
fire
estelle
was
screaming
cradled
in
alzire
arms
the
latter
having
no
more
sugar
and
not
knowing
how
to
soothe
her
had
decided
to
pretend
to
give
her
the
breast
this
ruse
often
succeeded
but
this
time
it
was
in
vain
for
her
to
open
her
dress
and
to
press
the
mouth
against
the
lean
breast
of
an
invalid
the
child
was
enraged
at
biting
the
skin
and
drawing
nothing
pass
her
to
me
cried
the
mother
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
free
she
wo
let
us
say
a
word
when
she
had
taken
from
her
bodice
a
breast
as
heavy
as
a
leather
bottle
to
the
neck
of
which
the
brawler
hung
suddenly
silent
they
were
at
last
able
to
talk
otherwise
everything
was
going
on
well
the
little
housekeeper
had
kept
up
the
fire
and
had
swept
and
arranged
the
room
and
in
the
silence
they
heard
upstairs
the
grandfather
snoring
the
same
rhythmic
snoring
which
had
not
stopped
for
a
moment
what
a
lot
of
things
murmured
alzire
smiling
at
the
provisions
if
you
like
mother
i
make
the
soup
the
table
was
encumbered
a
parcel
of
clothes
two
loaves
potatoes
butter
coffee
chicory
and
half
a
pound
of
pig
chitterlings
oh
the
soup
said
maheude
with
an
air
of
fatigue
we
must
gather
some
sorrel
and
pull
up
some
leeks
no
i
will
make
some
for
the
men
afterwards
put
some
potatoes
on
to
boil
we
eat
them
with
a
little
butter
and
some
coffee
eh
do
forget
the
coffee
but
suddenly
she
thought
of
the
brioche
she
looked
at
the
empty
hands
of
lénore
and
henri
who
were
fighting
on
the
floor
already
rested
and
lively
these
gluttons
had
slyly
eaten
the
brioche
on
the
road
she
boxed
their
ears
while
alzire
who
was
putting
the
saucepan
on
the
fire
tried
to
appease
her
let
them
be
mother
if
the
brioche
was
for
me
you
know
i
do
mind
a
bit
they
were
hungry
walking
so
far
midday
struck
they
heard
the
clogs
of
the
children
coming
out
of
school
the
potatoes
were
cooked
and
the
coffee
thickened
by
a
good
half
of
chicory
was
passing
through
the
percolator
with
a
singing
noise
of
large
drops
one
corner
of
the
table
was
free
but
the
mother
only
was
eating
there
the
three
children
were
satisfied
with
their
knees
and
all
the
time
the
little
boy
with
silent
voracity
looked
without
saying
anything
at
the
chitterlings
excited
by
the
greasy
paper
maheude
was
drinking
her
coffee
in
little
sips
with
her
hands
round
the
glass
to
warm
them
when
father
bonnemort
came
down
usually
he
rose
late
and
his
breakfast
waited
for
him
on
the
fire
but
he
began
to
grumble
because
there
was
no
soup
then
when
his
said
to
him
that
one
can
not
always
do
what
one
likes
he
ate
his
potatoes
in
silence
from
time
to
time
he
got
up
to
spit
in
the
ashes
for
cleanliness
and
settled
in
his
chair
he
rolled
his
food
round
in
his
mouth
with
lowered
head
and
dull
eyes
ah
i
forgot
mother
said
alzire
the
neighbour
came
her
mother
interrupted
her
she
bothers
me
there
was
a
deep
rancour
against
the
levaque
woman
who
had
pleaded
poverty
the
day
before
to
avoid
lending
her
anything
while
she
knew
that
she
was
just
then
in
comfort
since
her
lodger
bouteloup
had
paid
his
fortnight
in
advance
in
the
settlement
they
did
not
usually
lend
from
household
to
household
here
you
remind
me
said
maheude
wrap
up
a
millful
of
coffee
i
will
take
it
to
pierronne
i
owe
it
her
from
the
day
before
yesterday
and
when
her
daughter
had
prepared
the
packet
she
added
that
she
would
come
back
immediately
to
put
the
men
soup
on
the
fire
then
she
went
out
with
estelle
in
her
arms
leaving
old
bonnemort
to
chew
his
potatoes
leisurely
while
lénore
and
henri
fought
for
the
fallen
parings
instead
of
going
round
maheude
went
straight
across
through
the
gardens
for
fear
lest
levaque
wife
should
call
her
her
garden
was
just
next
to
that
of
the
pierrons
and
in
the
dilapidated
which
separated
them
there
was
a
hole
through
which
they
fraternized
the
common
well
was
there
serving
four
households
beside
it
behind
a
clump
of
feeble
lilacs
was
situated
the
shed
a
low
building
full
of
old
tools
in
which
were
brought
up
the
rabbits
which
were
eaten
on
feast
days
one
struck
it
was
the
hour
for
coffee
and
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
at
the
doors
or
windows
only
a
workman
belonging
to
the
waiting
the
hour
for
descent
was
digging
up
his
patch
of
vegetable
ground
without
raising
his
head
but
as
maheude
arrived
opposite
the
other
block
of
buildings
she
was
surprised
to
see
a
gentleman
and
two
ladies
in
front
of
the
church
she
stopped
a
moment
and
recognized
them
it
was
madame
hennebeau
bringing
her
guests
the
decorated
gentleman
and
the
lady
in
the
fur
mantle
to
see
the
settlement
oh
why
did
you
take
this
trouble
exclaimed
pierronne
when
maheude
had
returned
the
coffee
there
was
no
hurry
she
was
and
was
considered
the
beauty
of
the
settlement
dark
with
a
low
forehead
large
eyes
straight
mouth
and
coquettish
as
well
with
the
neatness
of
a
cat
and
with
a
good
figure
for
she
had
had
no
children
her
mother
brulé
the
widow
of
a
pikeman
who
died
in
the
mine
after
having
sent
her
daughter
to
work
in
a
factory
swearing
that
she
should
never
marry
a
collier
had
never
ceased
to
be
angry
since
she
had
married
somewhat
late
pierron
a
widower
with
a
girl
of
eight
however
the
household
lived
very
happily
in
the
midst
of
chatter
of
scandals
which
circulated
concerning
the
complaisance
and
the
wife
lovers
no
debts
meat
twice
a
week
a
house
kept
so
clean
that
one
could
see
oneself
in
the
saucepans
as
an
additional
piece
of
luck
thanks
to
favours
the
company
had
authorized
her
to
sell
and
biscuits
jars
of
which
she
exhibited
on
two
boards
behind
the
this
was
six
or
seven
sous
profit
a
day
and
sometimes
twelve
on
sundays
the
only
drawback
to
all
this
happiness
was
mother
brulé
who
screamed
with
all
the
rage
of
an
old
revolutionary
having
to
avenge
the
death
of
her
man
on
the
masters
and
little
lydie
who
pocketed
in
the
shape
of
frequent
blows
the
passions
of
the
family
how
big
she
is
already
said
pierronne
simpering
at
estelle
oh
the
trouble
that
it
gives
do
talk
of
it
said
maheude
you
are
lucky
not
to
have
any
at
least
you
can
keep
clean
although
everything
was
in
order
in
her
house
and
she
scrubbed
every
saturday
she
glanced
with
a
jealous
housekeeper
eye
over
this
clean
room
in
which
there
was
even
a
certain
coquetry
gilt
vases
on
the
sideboard
a
mirror
three
framed
prints
pierronne
was
about
to
drink
her
coffee
alone
all
her
people
being
at
the
pit
you
have
a
glass
with
me
she
said
no
thanks
i
just
swallowed
mine
what
does
that
matter
in
fact
it
mattered
nothing
and
both
began
drinking
slowly
between
the
jars
of
biscuits
and
their
eyes
rested
on
the
opposite
houses
of
which
the
little
curtains
in
the
windows
formed
a
row
revealing
by
their
greater
or
less
whiteness
the
virtues
of
the
housekeepers
those
of
the
levaques
were
very
dirty
veritable
kitchen
clouts
which
seemed
to
have
wiped
the
bottoms
of
the
saucepans
how
can
they
live
in
such
dirt
murmured
pierronne
then
maheude
began
and
did
not
stop
ah
if
she
had
had
a
lodger
like
that
bouteloup
she
would
have
made
the
household
go
when
one
knew
how
to
do
it
a
lodger
was
an
excellent
thing
only
one
ought
not
to
sleep
with
him
and
then
the
husband
had
taken
to
drink
beat
his
wife
and
ran
after
the
singers
at
the
montsou
pierronne
assumed
an
air
of
profound
disgust
these
singers
gave
all
sort
of
diseases
there
was
one
at
joiselle
who
had
infected
a
whole
pit
what
surprises
me
is
that
you
let
your
son
go
with
their
girl
ah
yes
but
just
stop
it
then
their
garden
is
next
to
ours
zacharie
was
always
there
in
summer
with
philoméne
behind
the
lilacs
and
they
did
put
themselves
out
on
the
shed
one
could
draw
water
at
the
well
without
surprising
them
it
was
the
usual
history
of
the
promiscuities
of
the
settlement
boys
and
girls
became
corrupted
together
throwing
themselves
on
their
backsides
as
they
said
on
the
low
sloping
roof
of
the
shed
when
twilight
came
on
all
the
putters
got
their
first
child
there
when
they
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
go
to
réquillart
or
into
the
cornfields
it
was
of
no
consequence
they
married
afterwards
only
the
mothers
were
angry
when
their
lads
began
too
soon
for
a
lad
who
married
no
longer
brought
anything
into
the
family
in
your
place
i
would
have
done
with
it
said
pierronne
sensibly
your
zacharie
has
already
filled
her
twice
and
they
will
go
on
and
get
spliced
anyhow
the
money
is
gone
maheude
was
furious
and
raised
her
hands
listen
to
this
i
will
curse
them
if
they
get
spliced
zacharie
owe
us
any
respect
he
has
cost
us
something
has
he
very
well
he
must
return
it
before
getting
a
wife
to
hang
on
him
what
will
become
of
us
eh
if
our
children
begin
at
once
to
work
for
others
might
as
well
die
however
she
grew
calm
i
speaking
in
a
general
way
we
shall
see
later
it
is
fine
and
strong
your
coffee
you
make
it
proper
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
spent
over
other
stories
she
ran
off
exclaiming
that
the
men
soup
was
not
yet
made
outside
the
children
were
going
back
to
school
a
few
women
were
showing
themselves
at
their
doors
looking
at
madame
hennebeau
who
with
lifted
finger
was
explaining
the
settlement
to
her
guests
this
visit
began
to
stir
up
the
village
the
man
stopped
digging
for
a
moment
and
two
disturbed
fowls
took
fright
in
the
gardens
as
maheude
returned
she
ran
against
the
levaque
woman
who
had
come
out
to
stop
vanderhaghen
a
doctor
of
the
company
a
small
hurried
man
overwhelmed
by
work
who
gave
his
advice
as
he
walked
sir
she
said
i
ca
sleep
i
feel
ill
everywhere
i
must
tell
you
about
it
he
spoke
to
them
all
familiarly
and
replied
without
stopping
just
leave
me
alone
you
drink
too
much
coffee
and
my
husband
sir
said
maheude
in
her
turn
you
must
come
and
see
him
he
always
has
those
pains
in
his
legs
it
is
you
who
take
too
much
out
of
him
just
leave
me
alone
the
two
women
were
left
to
gaze
at
the
doctor
retreating
back
come
in
then
said
the
levaque
woman
when
she
had
exchanged
a
despairing
shrug
with
her
neighbour
you
know
there
is
something
new
and
you
will
take
a
little
coffee
it
is
quite
fresh
maheude
refused
but
without
energy
well
a
drop
at
all
events
not
to
disoblige
and
she
entered
the
room
was
black
with
dirt
the
floor
and
the
walls
spotted
with
grease
the
sideboard
and
the
table
sticky
with
filth
and
the
stink
of
a
badly
kept
house
took
you
by
the
throat
near
the
fire
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
nose
in
his
plate
bouteloup
a
broad
stout
placid
man
still
young
for
was
finishing
the
remains
of
his
boiled
beef
while
standing
in
front
of
him
little
achille
philoméne
who
was
already
in
his
third
year
was
looking
at
him
in
the
silent
supplicating
way
of
a
gluttonous
animal
the
lodger
very
kind
behind
his
big
brown
beard
from
time
to
time
stuffed
a
piece
of
meat
into
his
mouth
wait
till
i
sugar
it
said
the
levaque
woman
putting
some
brown
sugar
beforehand
into
the
six
years
older
than
he
was
she
was
hideous
and
worn
out
with
her
bosom
hanging
on
her
belly
and
her
belly
on
her
thighs
with
a
flattened
muzzle
and
greyish
hair
always
uncombed
he
had
taken
her
naturally
without
choosing
the
same
as
he
did
his
soup
in
which
he
found
hairs
or
his
bed
of
which
the
sheets
lasted
for
three
months
she
was
part
of
the
lodging
the
husband
liked
repeating
that
good
reckonings
make
good
friends
i
was
going
to
tell
you
she
went
on
that
pierronne
was
seen
yesterday
prowling
about
on
the
side
the
gentleman
you
know
of
was
waiting
for
her
behind
rasseneur
and
they
went
off
together
along
the
canal
eh
that
nice
is
it
a
married
woman
gracious
said
maheude
pierron
before
marrying
her
used
to
give
the
captain
rabbits
now
it
costs
him
less
to
lend
his
wife
bouteloup
began
to
laugh
enormously
and
threw
a
fragment
of
sauced
bread
into
achille
mouth
the
two
women
went
on
relieving
themselves
with
regard
to
pierronne
a
flirt
no
prettier
than
any
one
else
but
always
occupied
in
looking
after
every
freckle
of
her
skin
in
washing
herself
and
putting
on
pomade
anyhow
it
was
the
husband
affair
if
he
liked
that
sort
of
thing
there
were
men
so
ambitious
that
they
would
wipe
the
masters
behinds
to
hear
them
say
thank
you
and
they
were
only
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
neighbour
bringing
in
a
little
urchin
of
nine
months
désirée
philoméne
youngest
philoméne
taking
her
breakfast
at
the
had
arranged
that
they
should
bring
her
little
one
down
there
where
she
suckled
it
seated
for
a
moment
in
the
coal
i
ca
leave
mine
for
a
moment
she
screams
directly
said
maheude
looking
at
estelle
who
was
asleep
in
her
arms
but
she
did
not
succeed
in
avoiding
the
domestic
affair
which
she
had
read
in
the
other
eyes
i
say
now
we
ought
to
get
that
settled
at
first
the
two
mothers
without
need
for
talking
about
it
had
agreed
not
to
conclude
the
marriage
if
zacharie
mother
wished
to
get
her
son
wages
as
long
as
possible
philoméne
mother
was
enraged
at
the
idea
of
abandoning
her
daughter
wages
there
was
no
hurry
the
second
mother
had
even
preferred
to
keep
the
little
one
as
long
as
there
was
only
one
but
when
it
began
to
grow
and
eat
and
another
one
came
she
found
that
she
was
losing
and
furiously
pushed
on
the
marriage
like
a
woman
who
does
not
care
to
throw
away
her
money
zacharie
has
drawn
his
lot
she
went
on
and
there
nothing
in
the
way
when
shall
it
be
wait
till
the
fine
weather
replied
maheude
constrainedly
they
are
a
nuisance
these
affairs
as
if
they
could
wait
to
be
married
before
going
together
my
word
i
would
strangle
catherine
if
i
knew
that
she
had
done
that
the
other
woman
shrugged
her
shoulders
let
be
she
do
like
the
others
bouteloup
with
the
tranquillity
of
a
man
who
is
at
home
searched
about
on
the
dresser
for
bread
vegetables
for
levaque
soup
potatoes
and
leeks
lay
about
on
a
corner
of
the
table
taken
up
and
dropped
a
dozen
times
in
the
midst
of
continual
gossiping
the
woman
was
about
to
go
on
with
them
again
when
she
dropped
them
anew
and
planted
herself
before
the
window
what
that
there
why
there
madame
hennebeau
with
some
people
they
are
going
into
pierronne
at
once
both
of
them
started
again
on
the
subject
of
pierronne
oh
whenever
the
company
brought
any
visitors
to
the
settlement
they
never
failed
to
go
straight
to
her
place
because
it
was
clean
no
doubt
they
never
told
them
stories
about
the
head
captain
one
can
afford
to
be
clean
when
one
has
lovers
who
earn
three
thousand
francs
and
are
lodged
and
warmed
without
counting
presents
if
it
was
clean
above
it
was
not
clean
underneath
and
all
the
time
that
the
visitors
remained
opposite
they
went
on
chattering
there
they
are
coming
out
said
the
levaque
woman
at
last
they
are
going
all
around
why
look
my
dear
i
believe
they
are
going
into
your
place
maheude
was
seized
with
fear
who
knows
whether
alzire
had
sponged
over
the
table
and
her
soup
also
which
was
not
yet
ready
she
stammered
a
and
ran
off
home
without
a
single
glance
aside
but
everything
was
bright
alzire
very
seriously
with
a
cloth
in
front
of
her
had
set
about
making
the
soup
seeing
that
her
mother
did
not
return
she
had
pulled
up
the
last
leeks
from
the
garden
gathered
the
sorrel
and
was
just
then
cleaning
the
vegetables
while
a
large
kettle
on
the
fire
was
heating
the
water
for
the
men
baths
when
they
should
return
henri
and
lénore
were
good
for
once
being
absorbed
in
tearing
up
an
old
almanac
father
bonnemort
was
smoking
his
pipe
in
silence
as
maheude
was
getting
her
breath
madame
hennebeau
knocked
you
will
allow
me
will
you
not
my
good
woman
tall
and
fair
a
little
heavy
in
her
superb
maturity
of
forty
years
she
smiled
with
an
effort
of
affability
without
showing
too
prominently
her
fear
of
soiling
her
bronze
silk
dress
and
black
velvet
mantle
come
in
come
in
she
said
to
her
guests
we
are
not
disturbing
any
one
now
is
this
clean
again
and
this
good
woman
has
seven
children
all
our
households
are
like
this
i
ought
to
explain
to
you
that
the
company
rents
them
the
house
at
six
francs
a
month
a
large
room
on
the
ground
floor
two
rooms
above
a
cellar
and
a
garden
the
decorated
gentleman
and
the
lady
in
the
fur
cloak
arrived
that
morning
by
train
from
paris
opened
their
eyes
vaguely
exhibiting
on
their
faces
their
astonishment
at
all
these
new
things
which
took
them
out
of
their
element
and
a
garden
repeated
the
lady
one
could
live
here
it
is
charming
we
give
them
more
coal
than
they
can
burn
went
on
madame
hennebeau
a
doctor
visits
them
twice
a
week
and
when
they
are
old
they
receive
pensions
although
nothing
is
held
back
from
their
wages
a
thebaid
a
real
land
of
milk
and
honey
murmured
the
gentleman
in
delight
maheude
had
hastened
to
offer
chairs
the
ladies
refused
madame
hennebeau
was
already
getting
tired
happy
for
a
moment
to
amuse
herself
in
the
weariness
of
her
exile
by
playing
the
part
of
exhibiting
the
beasts
but
immediately
disgusted
by
the
sickly
odour
of
wretchedness
in
spite
of
the
special
cleanliness
of
the
houses
into
which
she
ventured
besides
she
was
only
repeating
odd
phrases
which
she
had
overheard
without
ever
troubling
herself
further
about
this
race
of
workpeople
who
were
labouring
and
suffering
beside
her
what
beautiful
children
murmured
the
lady
who
thought
them
hideous
with
their
large
heads
beneath
their
bushy
hair
and
maheude
had
to
tell
their
ages
they
also
asked
her
questions
about
estelle
out
of
politeness
father
bonnemort
respectfully
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
but
he
was
not
the
less
a
subject
of
uneasiness
so
worn
out
by
his
forty
years
underground
with
his
stiff
limbs
deformed
body
and
earthy
face
and
as
a
violent
spasm
of
coughing
took
him
he
preferred
to
go
and
spit
outside
with
the
idea
that
his
black
expectoration
would
make
people
uncomfortable
alzire
received
all
the
compliments
what
an
excellent
little
housekeeper
with
her
cloth
they
congratulated
the
mother
on
having
a
little
daughter
so
sensible
for
her
age
and
none
spoke
of
the
hump
though
looks
of
uneasy
compassion
were
constantly
turned
towards
the
poor
little
invalid
now
concluded
madame
hennebeau
if
they
ask
you
about
our
settlements
at
paris
you
will
know
what
to
reply
never
more
noise
than
this
patriarchal
manners
all
happy
and
well
off
as
you
see
a
place
where
you
might
come
to
recruit
a
little
on
account
of
the
good
air
and
the
tranquillity
it
is
marvellous
marvellous
exclaimed
the
gentleman
in
a
final
outburst
of
enthusiasm
they
left
with
that
enchanted
air
with
which
people
leave
a
booth
in
a
fair
and
maheude
who
accompanied
them
remained
on
the
threshold
while
they
went
away
slowly
talking
very
loudly
the
streets
were
full
of
people
and
they
had
to
pass
through
several
groups
of
women
attracted
by
the
news
of
their
visit
which
was
hawked
from
house
to
house
just
then
levaque
in
front
of
her
door
had
stopped
pierronne
who
was
drawn
by
curiosity
both
of
them
affected
a
painful
surprise
what
now
were
these
people
going
to
bed
at
the
maheus
but
it
was
not
so
very
delightful
a
place
always
without
a
sou
with
all
that
they
earn
lord
when
people
have
vices
i
have
just
heard
that
she
went
this
morning
to
beg
at
piolaine
and
maigrat
who
had
refused
them
bread
has
given
them
something
we
know
how
maigrat
pays
himself
on
her
oh
no
that
would
need
some
courage
it
catherine
that
after
why
did
she
have
the
cheek
to
say
just
now
that
she
would
strangle
catherine
if
she
were
to
come
to
that
as
if
big
chaval
for
ever
so
long
had
not
put
her
backside
on
the
shed
hush
here
they
are
then
levaque
and
pierronne
with
a
peaceful
air
and
without
impolite
curiosity
contented
themselves
with
watching
the
visitors
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
then
by
a
gesture
they
quickly
called
maheude
who
was
still
carrying
estelle
in
her
arms
and
all
three
motionless
watched
the
backs
of
madame
hennebeau
and
her
guests
slowly
disappear
when
they
were
some
thirty
paces
off
the
gossiping
recommenced
with
redoubled
vigour
they
carry
plenty
of
money
on
their
skins
worth
more
than
themselves
perhaps
ah
sure
i
do
know
the
other
but
the
one
that
belongs
here
i
would
give
four
sous
for
her
big
as
she
is
they
do
tell
stories
eh
what
stories
why
she
has
men
first
the
engineer
that
lean
little
creature
oh
he
too
small
she
would
lose
him
in
the
sheets
what
does
that
matter
if
it
amuses
her
i
do
trust
a
woman
who
puts
on
such
proud
airs
and
never
seems
to
be
pleased
where
she
is
just
look
how
she
wags
her
rump
as
if
she
felt
contempt
for
us
all
is
that
nice
the
visitors
went
along
at
the
same
slow
pace
still
talking
when
a
carriage
stopped
in
the
road
before
the
church
a
gentleman
of
about
got
out
of
it
dressed
in
a
black
and
with
a
very
dark
complexion
and
an
authoritative
correct
expression
the
husband
murmured
levaque
lowering
her
voice
as
if
he
could
hear
her
seized
by
that
hierarchical
fear
which
the
manager
inspired
in
his
ten
thousand
workpeople
it
true
though
that
he
has
a
cuckold
head
that
man
now
the
whole
settlement
was
out
of
doors
the
curiosity
of
the
women
increased
the
groups
approached
each
other
and
were
melted
into
one
crowd
while
bands
of
urchins
with
unwiped
noses
and
gaping
mouths
dawdled
along
the
pavements
for
a
moment
the
schoolmaster
pale
head
was
also
seen
behind
the
hedge
among
the
gardens
the
man
who
was
digging
stood
with
one
foot
on
his
spade
and
with
rounded
eyes
and
the
murmur
of
gossiping
gradually
increased
with
a
sound
of
rattles
like
a
gust
of
wind
among
dry
leaves
it
was
especially
before
the
levaques
door
that
the
crowd
was
thickest
two
women
had
come
forward
then
ten
then
twenty
pierronne
was
prudently
silent
now
that
there
were
too
many
ears
about
maheude
one
of
the
more
reasonable
also
contented
herself
with
looking
on
and
to
calm
estelle
who
was
awake
and
screaming
she
had
tranquilly
drawn
out
her
suckling
animal
breast
which
hung
swaying
as
if
pulled
down
by
the
continual
running
of
its
milk
when
hennebeau
had
seated
the
ladies
in
the
carriage
which
went
off
in
the
direction
of
marchiennes
there
was
a
final
explosion
of
clattering
voices
all
the
women
gesticulating
and
talking
in
each
other
faces
in
the
midst
of
a
tumult
as
of
an
in
revolution
but
three
struck
the
workers
of
the
bouteloup
and
the
others
had
set
out
suddenly
around
the
church
appeared
the
first
colliers
returning
from
the
pit
with
black
faces
and
damp
garments
folding
their
arms
and
expanding
their
backs
then
there
was
confusion
among
the
women
they
all
began
to
run
home
with
the
terror
of
housekeepers
who
had
been
led
astray
by
too
much
coffee
and
too
much
tattle
and
one
heard
nothing
more
than
this
restless
cry
pregnant
with
quarrels
good
lord
and
my
soup
and
my
soup
which
is
ready
chapter
iv
when
maheu
came
in
after
having
left
étienne
at
rasseneur
he
found
catherine
zacharie
and
jeanlin
seated
at
the
table
finishing
their
soup
on
returning
from
the
pit
they
were
always
so
hungry
that
they
ate
in
their
damp
clothes
without
even
cleaning
themselves
and
no
one
was
waited
for
the
table
was
laid
from
morning
to
night
there
was
always
someone
there
swallowing
his
portion
according
to
the
chances
of
work
as
he
entered
the
door
maheu
saw
the
provisions
he
said
nothing
but
his
uneasy
face
lighted
up
all
the
morning
the
emptiness
of
the
cupboard
the
thought
of
the
house
without
coffee
and
without
butter
had
been
troubling
him
the
recollection
came
to
him
painfully
while
he
was
hammering
at
the
seam
stifled
at
the
bottom
of
the
cutting
what
would
his
wife
do
and
what
would
become
of
them
if
she
were
to
return
with
empty
hands
and
now
here
was
everything
she
would
tell
him
about
it
later
on
he
laughed
with
satisfaction
catherine
and
jeanlin
had
risen
and
were
taking
their
coffee
standing
while
zacharie
not
filled
with
the
soup
cut
himself
a
large
slice
of
bread
and
covered
it
with
butter
although
he
saw
the
chitterlings
on
a
plate
he
did
not
touch
them
for
meat
was
for
the
father
when
there
was
only
enough
for
one
all
of
them
had
washed
down
their
soup
with
a
big
bumper
of
fresh
water
the
good
clear
drink
of
the
fortnight
end
i
have
no
beer
said
maheude
when
the
father
had
seated
himself
in
his
turn
i
wanted
to
keep
a
little
money
but
if
you
would
like
some
the
little
one
can
go
and
fetch
a
pint
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
what
she
had
money
too
no
no
he
said
i
had
a
glass
it
all
right
and
maheu
began
to
swallow
by
slow
spoonfuls
the
paste
of
bread
potatoes
leeks
and
sorrel
piled
up
in
the
bowl
which
served
him
as
a
plate
maheude
without
putting
estelle
down
helped
alzire
to
give
him
all
that
he
required
pushed
near
him
the
butter
and
the
meat
and
put
his
coffee
on
the
fire
to
keep
it
quite
hot
in
the
meanwhile
beside
the
fire
they
began
to
wash
themselves
in
the
half
of
a
barrel
transformed
into
a
tub
catherine
whose
turn
came
first
had
filled
it
with
warm
water
and
she
undressed
herself
tranquilly
took
off
her
cap
her
jacket
her
breeches
and
even
her
chemise
habituated
to
this
since
the
age
of
eight
having
grown
up
without
seeing
any
harm
in
it
she
only
turned
with
her
stomach
to
the
fire
then
rubbed
herself
vigorously
with
black
soap
no
one
looked
at
her
even
lénore
and
henri
were
no
longer
inquisitive
to
see
how
she
was
made
when
she
was
clean
she
went
up
the
stairs
quite
naked
leaving
her
damp
chemise
and
other
garments
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
but
a
quarrel
broke
out
between
the
two
brothers
jeanlin
had
hastened
to
jump
into
the
tub
under
the
pretence
that
zacharie
was
still
eating
and
the
latter
hustled
him
claiming
his
turn
and
calling
out
that
he
was
polite
enough
to
allow
catherine
to
wash
herself
first
but
he
did
not
wish
to
have
the
rinsings
of
the
young
urchins
all
the
less
since
when
jeanlin
had
been
in
it
would
do
to
fill
the
school
they
ended
by
washing
themselves
together
also
turning
towards
the
fire
and
they
even
helped
each
other
rubbing
one
another
backs
then
like
their
sister
they
disappeared
up
the
staircase
naked
what
a
slop
they
do
make
murmured
maheude
taking
up
their
garments
from
the
floor
to
put
them
to
dry
alzire
just
sponge
up
a
bit
but
a
disturbance
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
cut
short
her
speech
one
heard
a
man
oaths
a
woman
crying
a
whole
stampede
of
battle
with
hollow
blows
that
sounded
like
the
shock
of
an
empty
gourd
levaque
wife
is
catching
it
maheu
peacefully
stated
as
he
scraped
the
bottom
of
his
bowl
with
the
spoon
it
queer
bouteloup
made
out
that
the
soup
was
ready
ah
yes
ready
said
maheude
i
saw
the
vegetables
on
the
table
not
even
cleaned
the
cries
redoubled
and
there
was
a
terrible
push
which
shook
the
wall
followed
by
complete
silence
then
the
miner
swallowing
the
last
spoonful
concluded
with
an
air
of
calm
justice
if
the
soup
is
not
ready
one
can
understand
and
after
having
drunk
a
glassful
of
water
he
attacked
the
chitterlings
he
cut
square
pieces
stuck
the
point
of
his
knife
into
them
and
ate
them
on
his
bread
without
a
fork
there
was
no
talking
when
the
father
was
eating
he
himself
was
hungry
in
silence
he
did
not
recognize
the
usual
taste
of
maigrat
provisions
this
must
come
from
somewhere
else
however
he
put
no
question
to
his
wife
he
only
asked
if
the
old
man
was
still
sleeping
upstairs
no
the
grandfather
had
gone
out
for
his
usual
walk
and
there
was
silence
again
but
the
odour
of
the
meat
made
lénore
and
henri
lift
up
their
heads
from
the
floor
where
they
were
amusing
themselves
with
making
rivulets
with
the
spilt
water
both
of
them
came
and
planted
themselves
near
their
father
the
little
one
in
front
their
eyes
followed
each
morsel
full
of
hope
when
it
set
out
from
the
plate
and
with
an
air
of
consternation
when
it
was
engulfed
in
the
mouth
at
last
the
father
noticed
the
gluttonous
desire
which
made
their
faces
pale
and
their
lips
moist
have
the
children
had
any
of
it
he
asked
and
as
his
wife
hesitated
you
know
i
do
like
injustice
it
takes
away
my
appetite
when
i
see
them
there
begging
for
bits
but
they
had
some
of
it
she
exclaimed
angrily
if
you
were
to
listen
to
them
you
might
give
them
your
share
and
the
others
too
they
would
fill
themselves
till
they
burst
is
it
true
alzire
that
we
have
all
had
some
sure
enough
mother
replied
the
little
humpback
who
under
such
circumstances
could
tell
lies
with
the
of
a
person
lénore
and
henri
stood
motionless
shocked
and
rebellious
at
such
lying
when
they
themselves
were
whipped
if
they
did
not
tell
the
truth
their
little
hearts
began
to
swell
and
they
longed
to
protest
and
to
say
that
they
at
all
events
were
not
there
when
the
others
had
some
get
along
with
you
said
the
mother
driving
them
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
being
always
in
your
plate
and
even
if
he
was
the
only
one
to
have
any
does
he
work
while
all
you
a
lot
of
ca
do
anything
but
spend
yes
and
the
more
the
bigger
you
are
maheu
called
them
back
he
seated
lénore
on
his
left
thigh
henri
on
the
right
then
he
finished
the
chitterlings
by
playing
at
dinner
with
them
he
cut
small
pieces
and
each
had
his
share
the
children
devoured
with
delight
when
he
had
finished
he
said
to
his
wife
no
do
give
me
my
coffee
i
going
to
wash
first
and
just
give
me
a
hand
to
throw
away
this
dirty
water
they
took
hold
of
the
handles
of
the
tub
and
emptied
it
into
the
gutter
before
the
door
when
jeanlin
came
down
in
dry
garments
breeches
and
a
woollen
blouse
too
large
for
him
which
were
weary
of
fading
on
his
brother
back
seeing
him
slinking
out
through
the
open
door
his
mother
stopped
him
where
are
you
off
to
over
there
over
where
listen
to
me
you
go
and
gather
a
dandelion
salad
for
this
evening
eh
do
you
hear
if
you
do
bring
a
salad
back
you
have
to
deal
with
me
all
right
jeanlin
set
out
with
hands
in
his
pockets
trailing
his
sabots
and
slouching
along
with
his
slender
loins
of
a
urchin
like
an
old
miner
in
his
turn
zacharie
came
down
more
carefully
dressed
his
body
covered
by
a
black
woollen
knitted
jacket
with
blue
stripes
his
father
called
out
to
him
not
to
return
late
and
he
left
nodding
his
head
with
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
without
replying
again
the
tub
was
filled
with
warm
water
maheu
was
already
slowly
taking
off
his
jacket
at
a
look
alzire
led
lénore
and
henri
outside
to
play
the
father
did
not
like
washing
as
was
practised
in
many
houses
in
the
settlement
he
blamed
no
one
however
he
simply
said
that
it
was
good
for
the
children
to
dabble
together
what
are
you
doing
up
there
cried
maheude
up
the
staircase
i
mending
my
dress
that
i
tore
yesterday
replied
catherine
all
right
do
come
down
your
father
is
washing
then
maheu
and
maheude
were
left
alone
the
latter
decided
to
place
estelle
on
a
chair
and
by
a
miracle
finding
herself
near
the
fire
the
child
did
not
scream
but
turned
towards
her
parents
the
vague
eyes
of
a
little
creature
without
intelligence
he
was
crouching
before
the
tub
quite
naked
having
first
plunged
his
head
into
it
well
rubbed
with
that
black
soap
the
constant
use
of
which
discoloured
and
made
yellow
the
hair
of
the
race
afterwards
he
got
into
the
water
lathered
his
chest
belly
arms
and
thighs
scraping
them
energetically
with
both
fists
his
wife
standing
by
watched
him
well
then
she
began
i
saw
your
eyes
when
you
came
in
you
were
bothered
eh
and
it
eased
you
those
provisions
fancy
those
piolaine
people
did
give
me
a
sou
oh
they
are
kind
enough
they
have
dressed
the
little
ones
and
i
was
ashamed
to
ask
them
for
it
crosses
me
to
ask
for
things
she
interrupted
herself
a
moment
to
wedge
estelle
into
the
chair
lest
she
should
tip
over
the
father
continued
to
work
away
at
his
skin
without
hastening
by
a
question
this
story
which
interested
him
patiently
waiting
for
light
i
must
tell
you
that
maigrat
had
refused
me
oh
straight
like
one
kicks
a
dog
out
of
doors
guess
if
i
was
on
a
spree
they
keep
you
warm
woollen
garments
but
they
do
put
anything
into
your
stomach
eh
he
lifted
his
head
still
silent
nothing
at
piolaine
nothing
at
maigrat
then
where
but
as
usual
she
was
pulling
up
her
sleeves
to
wash
his
back
and
those
parts
which
he
could
not
himself
easily
reach
besides
he
liked
her
to
soap
him
to
rub
him
everywhere
till
she
almost
broke
her
wrists
she
took
soap
and
worked
away
at
his
shoulders
while
he
held
himself
stiff
so
as
to
resist
the
shock
then
i
returned
to
maigrat
and
said
to
him
ah
i
said
something
to
him
and
that
it
did
do
to
have
no
heart
and
that
evil
would
happen
to
him
if
there
were
any
justice
that
bothered
him
he
turned
his
eyes
and
would
like
to
have
got
away
from
the
back
she
had
got
down
to
the
buttocks
and
was
pushing
into
the
folds
not
leaving
any
part
of
the
body
without
passing
over
it
making
him
shine
like
her
three
saucepans
on
saturdays
after
a
big
clean
only
she
began
to
sweat
with
this
tremendous
exertion
of
her
arms
so
exhausted
and
out
of
breath
that
her
words
were
choked
at
last
he
called
me
an
old
nuisance
we
shall
have
bread
until
saturday
and
the
best
is
that
he
has
lent
me
five
francs
i
have
got
butter
coffee
and
chicory
from
him
i
was
even
going
to
get
the
meat
and
potatoes
there
only
i
saw
that
he
was
grumbling
seven
sous
for
the
chitterlings
eighteen
for
the
potatoes
and
i
got
three
francs
left
for
a
ragout
and
a
meat
soup
eh
i
do
think
wasted
my
morning
now
she
began
to
wipe
him
plugging
with
a
towel
the
parts
that
would
not
dry
feeling
happy
and
without
thinking
of
the
future
debt
he
burst
out
laughing
and
took
her
in
his
arms
leave
me
alone
stupid
you
are
damp
and
wetting
me
only
i
afraid
maigrat
has
ideas
she
was
about
to
speak
of
catherine
but
she
stopped
what
was
the
good
of
disturbing
him
it
would
only
lead
to
endless
discussion
what
ideas
he
asked
why
ideas
of
robbing
us
catherine
will
have
to
examine
the
bill
carefully
he
took
her
in
his
arms
again
and
this
time
did
not
let
her
go
the
bath
always
finished
in
this
way
she
enlivened
him
by
the
hard
rubbing
and
then
by
the
towels
which
tickled
the
hairs
of
his
arms
and
chest
besides
among
all
his
mates
of
the
settlement
it
was
the
hour
for
stupidities
when
more
children
were
planted
than
were
wanted
at
night
all
the
family
were
about
he
pushed
her
towards
the
table
jesting
like
a
worthy
man
who
was
enjoying
the
only
good
moment
of
the
day
calling
that
taking
his
dessert
and
a
dessert
which
cost
him
nothing
she
with
her
loose
figure
and
breast
struggled
a
little
for
fun
you
are
stupid
my
lord
you
are
stupid
and
there
estelle
looking
at
us
wait
till
i
turn
her
head
oh
bosh
at
three
months
as
if
she
understood
when
he
got
up
maheu
simply
put
on
a
dry
pair
of
breeches
he
liked
when
he
was
clean
and
had
taken
his
pleasure
with
his
wife
to
remain
naked
for
a
while
on
his
white
skin
the
whiteness
of
an
anaemic
girl
the
scratches
and
gashes
of
the
coal
left
grafts
as
the
miners
called
them
and
he
was
proud
of
them
and
exhibited
his
big
arms
and
broad
chest
shining
like
veined
marble
in
summer
all
the
miners
could
be
seen
in
this
condition
at
their
doors
he
even
went
there
for
a
moment
now
in
spite
of
the
wet
weather
and
shouted
out
a
rough
joke
to
a
comrade
whose
breast
was
also
naked
on
the
other
side
of
the
gardens
others
also
appeared
and
the
children
trailing
along
the
pathways
raised
their
heads
and
also
laughed
with
delight
at
all
this
weary
flesh
of
workers
displayed
in
the
open
air
while
drinking
his
coffee
without
yet
putting
on
a
shirt
maheu
told
his
wife
about
the
engineer
anger
over
the
planking
he
was
calm
and
unbent
and
listened
with
a
nod
of
approval
to
the
sensible
advice
of
maheude
who
showed
much
common
sense
in
such
affairs
she
always
repeated
to
him
that
nothing
was
gained
by
struggling
against
the
company
she
afterwards
told
him
about
madame
hennebeau
visit
without
saying
so
both
of
them
were
proud
of
this
can
i
come
down
yet
asked
catherine
from
the
top
of
the
staircase
yes
yes
your
father
is
drying
himself
the
young
girl
had
put
on
her
sunday
dress
an
old
frock
of
rough
blue
poplin
already
faded
and
worn
in
the
folds
she
had
on
a
very
simple
bonnet
of
black
tulle
hallo
you
dressed
where
are
you
going
to
i
going
to
montsou
to
buy
a
ribbon
for
my
bonnet
i
taken
off
the
old
one
it
was
too
dirty
have
you
got
money
then
no
but
mouquette
promised
to
lend
me
half
a
franc
the
mother
let
her
go
but
at
the
door
she
called
her
back
here
do
go
and
buy
that
ribbon
at
maigrat
he
will
rob
you
and
he
will
think
that
we
are
rolling
in
wealth
the
father
who
was
crouching
down
before
the
fire
to
dry
his
neck
and
shoulders
more
quickly
contented
himself
with
adding
try
not
to
dawdle
about
at
night
on
the
road
in
the
afternoon
maheu
worked
in
his
garden
already
he
had
sown
potatoes
beans
and
peas
and
he
now
set
about
replanting
cabbage
and
lettuce
plants
which
he
had
kept
fresh
from
the
night
before
this
bit
of
garden
furnished
them
with
vegetables
except
potatoes
of
which
they
never
had
enough
he
understood
gardening
very
well
and
could
even
grow
artichokes
which
was
treated
as
sheer
display
by
the
neighbours
as
he
was
preparing
the
bed
levaque
just
then
came
out
to
smoke
a
pipe
in
his
own
square
looking
at
the
cos
lettuces
which
bouteloup
had
planted
in
the
morning
for
without
the
lodger
energy
in
digging
nothing
would
have
grown
there
but
nettles
and
a
conversation
arose
over
the
trellis
levaque
refreshed
and
excited
by
thrashing
his
wife
vainly
tried
to
take
maheu
off
to
rasseneur
why
was
he
afraid
of
a
glass
they
could
have
a
game
at
skittles
lounge
about
for
a
while
with
the
mates
and
then
come
back
to
dinner
that
was
the
way
of
life
after
leaving
the
pit
no
doubt
there
was
no
harm
in
that
but
maheu
was
obstinate
if
he
did
not
replant
his
lettuces
they
would
be
faded
by
in
reality
he
refused
out
of
good
sense
not
wishing
to
ask
a
farthing
from
his
wife
out
of
the
change
of
the
piece
five
was
striking
when
pierronne
came
to
know
if
it
was
with
jeanlin
that
her
lydie
had
gone
off
levaque
replied
that
it
must
be
something
of
that
sort
for
bébert
had
also
disappeared
and
those
rascals
always
went
prowling
about
together
when
maheu
had
quieted
them
by
speaking
of
the
dandelion
salad
he
and
his
comrade
set
about
joking
the
young
woman
with
the
coarseness
of
devils
she
was
angry
but
did
not
go
away
in
reality
tickled
by
the
strong
words
which
made
her
scream
with
her
hands
to
her
sides
a
lean
woman
came
to
her
aid
stammering
with
anger
like
a
clucking
hen
others
in
the
distance
on
their
doorsteps
confided
their
alarms
now
the
school
was
closed
and
all
the
children
were
running
about
there
was
a
swarm
of
little
creatures
shouting
and
tumbling
and
fighting
while
those
fathers
who
were
not
at
the
were
resting
in
groups
of
three
or
four
crouching
on
their
heels
as
they
did
in
the
mine
smoking
their
pipes
with
an
occasional
word
in
the
shelter
of
a
wall
pierronne
went
off
in
a
fury
when
levaque
wanted
to
feel
if
her
thighs
were
firm
and
he
himself
decided
to
go
alone
to
rasseneur
since
maheu
was
still
planting
twilight
suddenly
came
on
maheude
lit
the
lamp
irritated
because
neither
her
daughter
nor
the
boys
had
come
back
she
could
have
guessed
as
much
they
never
succeeded
in
taking
together
the
only
meal
of
the
day
at
which
it
was
possible
for
them
to
be
all
round
the
table
then
she
was
waiting
for
the
dandelion
salad
what
could
he
be
gathering
at
this
hour
in
this
blackness
of
an
oven
that
nuisance
of
a
child
a
salad
would
go
so
well
with
the
stew
which
was
simmering
on
the
fire
potatoes
leeks
sorrel
fricasseed
with
fried
onion
the
whole
house
smelt
of
that
fried
onion
that
good
odour
which
gets
rank
so
soon
and
which
penetrates
the
bricks
of
the
settlements
with
such
infection
that
one
perceives
it
far
off
in
the
country
the
violent
flavour
of
the
poor
man
kitchen
maheu
when
he
left
the
garden
at
nightfall
at
once
fell
into
a
chair
with
his
head
against
the
wall
as
soon
as
he
sat
down
in
the
evening
he
went
to
sleep
the
clock
struck
seven
henri
and
lénore
had
just
broken
a
plate
in
persisting
in
helping
alzire
who
was
laying
the
table
when
father
bonnemort
came
in
first
in
a
hurry
to
dine
and
go
back
to
the
pit
then
maheude
woke
up
maheu
come
and
eat
so
much
the
worse
they
are
big
enough
to
find
the
house
the
nuisance
is
the
salad
chapter
v
at
rasseneur
after
having
eaten
his
soup
étienne
went
back
into
the
small
chamber
beneath
the
roof
and
facing
the
voreux
which
he
was
to
occupy
and
fell
on
to
his
bed
dressed
as
he
was
overcome
with
fatigue
in
two
days
he
had
not
slept
four
hours
when
he
awoke
in
the
twilight
he
was
dazed
for
a
moment
not
recognizing
his
surroundings
and
he
felt
such
uneasiness
and
his
head
was
so
heavy
that
he
rose
painfully
with
the
idea
of
getting
some
fresh
air
before
having
his
dinner
and
going
to
bed
for
the
night
outside
the
weather
was
becoming
milder
the
sooty
sky
was
growing
laden
with
one
of
those
warm
rains
of
the
nord
the
approach
of
which
one
feels
by
the
moist
warmth
of
the
air
and
the
night
was
coming
on
in
great
mists
which
drowned
the
distant
landscape
of
the
plain
over
this
immense
sea
of
reddish
earth
the
low
sky
seemed
to
melt
into
black
dust
without
a
breath
of
wind
now
to
animate
the
darkness
it
was
the
wan
and
deathly
melancholy
of
a
funeral
étienne
walked
straight
ahead
at
random
with
no
other
aim
but
to
shake
off
his
fever
when
he
passed
before
the
voreux
already
growing
gloomy
at
the
bottom
of
its
hole
and
with
no
lantern
yet
shining
from
it
he
stopped
a
moment
to
watch
the
departure
of
the
no
doubt
six
had
struck
landers
porters
from
the
and
grooms
were
going
away
in
bands
mixed
with
the
vague
and
laughing
figures
of
the
screening
girls
in
the
shade
at
first
it
was
brulé
and
her
pierron
she
was
abusing
him
because
he
had
not
supported
her
in
a
quarrel
with
an
overseer
over
her
reckoning
of
stones
get
along
damned
do
you
call
yourself
a
man
to
lower
yourself
like
that
before
one
of
these
beasts
who
devour
us
pierron
followed
her
peacefully
without
replying
at
last
he
said
i
suppose
i
ought
to
jump
on
the
boss
thanks
for
showing
me
how
to
get
into
a
mess
bend
your
backside
to
him
then
she
shouted
by
god
if
my
daughter
had
listened
to
me
it
not
enough
for
them
to
kill
the
father
perhaps
you
like
me
to
say
you
no
i
have
their
skins
first
their
voices
were
lost
étienne
saw
her
disappear
with
her
eagle
nose
her
flying
white
hair
her
long
lean
arms
that
gesticulated
furiously
but
the
conversation
of
two
young
people
behind
caused
him
to
listen
he
had
recognized
zacharie
who
was
waiting
there
and
who
had
just
been
addressed
by
his
friend
mouquet
are
you
here
said
the
latter
we
will
have
something
to
eat
and
then
off
to
the
volcan
directly
i
something
to
attend
to
what
then
the
lander
turned
and
saw
philoméne
coming
out
of
the
he
thought
he
understood
very
well
if
it
that
then
i
go
ahead
yes
i
catch
you
up
as
he
went
away
mouquet
met
his
father
old
mouque
who
was
also
coming
out
of
the
voreux
the
two
men
simply
wished
each
other
good
evening
the
son
taking
the
main
road
while
the
father
went
along
by
the
canal
zacharie
was
already
pushing
philoméne
in
spite
of
her
resistance
into
the
same
solitary
path
she
was
in
a
hurry
another
time
and
the
two
wrangled
like
old
housemates
there
was
no
fun
in
only
seeing
one
another
out
of
doors
especially
in
winter
when
the
earth
is
moist
and
there
are
no
wheatfields
to
lie
in
no
no
it
not
that
he
whispered
impatiently
i
something
to
say
to
you
he
led
her
gently
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
then
when
they
were
in
the
shadow
of
the
he
asked
if
she
had
any
money
what
for
she
demanded
then
he
became
confused
spoke
of
a
debt
of
two
francs
which
had
reduced
his
family
to
despair
hold
your
tongue
i
seen
mouquet
you
going
again
to
the
volcan
with
him
where
those
dirty
are
he
defended
himself
struck
his
chest
gave
his
word
of
honour
then
as
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
he
said
suddenly
come
with
us
if
it
will
amuse
you
you
see
that
you
do
put
me
out
what
do
i
want
to
do
with
the
singers
will
you
come
and
the
little
one
she
replied
how
can
one
stir
with
a
child
that
always
screaming
let
me
go
back
i
guess
they
not
getting
on
at
the
house
but
he
held
her
and
entreated
see
it
was
only
not
to
look
foolish
before
mouquet
to
whom
he
had
promised
a
man
could
not
go
to
bed
every
evening
like
the
fowls
she
was
overcome
and
pulled
up
the
skirt
of
her
gown
with
her
nail
she
cut
the
thread
and
drew
out
some
pieces
from
a
corner
of
the
hem
for
fear
of
being
robbed
by
her
mother
she
hid
there
the
profit
of
the
overtime
work
she
did
at
the
pit
i
got
five
you
see
she
said
i
give
you
three
only
you
must
swear
that
you
make
your
mother
decide
to
let
us
marry
we
had
enough
of
this
life
in
the
open
air
and
mother
reproaches
me
for
every
mouthful
i
eat
swear
first
she
spoke
with
the
soft
voice
of
a
big
delicate
girl
without
passion
simply
tired
of
her
life
he
swore
exclaimed
that
it
was
a
sacred
promise
then
when
he
had
got
the
three
pieces
he
kissed
her
tickled
her
made
her
laugh
and
would
have
pushed
things
to
an
extreme
in
this
corner
of
the
which
was
the
winter
chamber
of
their
household
if
she
had
not
again
refused
saying
that
it
would
not
give
her
any
pleasure
she
went
back
to
the
settlement
alone
while
he
cut
across
the
fields
to
rejoin
his
companion
étienne
had
followed
them
mechanically
from
afar
without
understanding
regarding
it
as
a
simple
rendezvous
the
girls
were
precocious
in
the
pits
and
he
recalled
the
lille
whom
he
had
waited
for
behind
the
factories
those
bands
of
girls
corrupted
at
fourteen
in
the
abandonment
of
their
wretchedness
but
another
meeting
surprised
him
more
he
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
the
in
a
hollow
into
which
some
large
stones
had
slipped
little
jeanlin
was
violently
snubbing
lydie
and
bébert
seated
one
at
his
right
the
other
at
his
left
what
do
you
say
eh
i
slap
each
of
you
if
you
want
more
who
thought
of
it
first
eh
in
fact
jeanlin
had
had
an
idea
after
having
roamed
about
in
the
meadows
along
the
canal
for
an
hour
gathering
dandelions
with
the
two
others
it
had
occurred
to
him
before
this
pile
of
salad
that
they
would
never
eat
all
that
at
home
and
instead
of
going
back
to
the
settlement
he
had
gone
to
montsou
keeping
bébert
to
watch
and
making
lydie
ring
at
the
houses
and
offer
the
dandelions
he
was
experienced
enough
to
know
that
as
he
said
girls
could
sell
what
they
liked
in
the
ardour
of
business
the
entire
pile
had
disappeared
but
the
girl
had
gained
eleven
sous
and
now
with
empty
hands
the
three
were
dividing
the
profits
that
not
fair
bébert
declared
must
divide
into
three
if
you
keep
seven
sous
we
shall
only
have
two
each
what
not
fair
replied
jeanlin
furiously
i
gathered
more
first
of
all
the
other
usually
submitted
with
timid
admiration
and
a
credulity
which
always
made
him
the
dupe
though
older
and
stronger
he
even
allowed
himself
to
be
struck
but
this
time
the
sight
of
all
that
money
excited
him
to
rebellion
he
robbing
us
lydie
is
he
if
he
does
share
we
tell
his
mother
jeanlin
at
once
thrust
his
fist
beneath
the
other
nose
say
that
again
i
go
and
say
at
your
house
that
you
sold
my
mother
salad
and
then
you
silly
beast
how
can
i
divide
eleven
sous
into
three
just
try
and
see
if
you
so
clever
here
are
your
two
sous
each
just
look
sharp
and
take
them
or
i
put
them
in
my
pocket
bébert
was
vanquished
and
accepted
the
two
sous
lydie
who
was
trembling
had
said
nothing
for
with
jeanlin
she
experienced
the
fear
and
the
tenderness
of
a
little
beaten
woman
when
he
held
out
the
two
sous
to
her
she
advanced
her
hand
with
a
submissive
laugh
but
he
suddenly
changed
his
mind
eh
what
will
you
do
with
all
that
your
mother
will
nab
them
sure
enough
if
you
do
know
how
to
hide
them
from
her
i
better
keep
them
for
you
when
you
want
money
you
can
ask
me
for
it
and
the
nine
sous
disappeared
to
shut
her
mouth
he
had
put
his
arms
around
her
laughingly
and
was
rolling
with
her
over
the
she
was
his
little
wife
and
in
the
dark
corners
they
used
to
try
together
the
love
which
they
heard
and
saw
in
their
homes
behind
partitions
through
the
cracks
of
doors
they
knew
everything
but
they
were
able
to
do
nothing
being
too
young
fumbling
and
playing
for
hours
at
the
games
of
vicious
puppies
he
called
that
playing
at
papa
and
mama
and
when
he
chased
her
she
ran
away
and
let
herself
be
caught
with
the
delicious
trembling
of
instinct
often
angry
but
always
yielding
in
the
expectation
of
something
which
never
came
as
bébert
was
not
admitted
to
these
games
and
received
a
cuffing
whenever
he
wanted
to
touch
lydie
he
was
always
constrained
agitated
by
anger
and
uneasiness
when
the
other
two
were
amusing
themselves
which
they
did
not
hesitate
to
do
in
his
presence
his
one
idea
therefore
was
to
frighten
them
and
disturb
them
calling
out
that
someone
could
see
them
it
all
up
there
a
man
looking
this
time
he
told
the
truth
it
was
étienne
who
had
decided
to
continue
his
walk
the
children
jumped
up
and
ran
away
and
he
passed
by
round
the
bank
following
the
canal
amused
at
the
terror
of
these
little
rascals
no
doubt
it
was
too
early
at
their
age
but
they
saw
and
heard
so
much
that
one
would
have
to
tie
them
up
to
restrain
them
yet
étienne
became
sad
a
hundred
paces
farther
on
he
came
across
more
couples
he
had
arrived
at
réquillart
and
there
around
the
old
ruined
mine
all
the
girls
of
montsou
prowled
about
with
their
lovers
it
was
the
common
rendezvous
the
remote
and
deserted
spot
to
which
the
putters
came
to
get
their
first
child
when
they
dared
not
risk
the
shed
the
broken
palings
opened
to
every
one
the
old
yard
now
become
a
nondescript
piece
of
ground
obstructed
by
the
ruins
of
the
two
sheds
which
had
fallen
in
and
by
the
skeletons
of
the
large
buttresses
which
were
still
standing
derelict
trams
were
lying
about
and
piles
of
old
rotting
wood
while
a
dense
vegetation
was
reconquering
this
corner
of
ground
displaying
itself
in
thick
grass
and
springing
up
in
young
trees
that
were
already
vigorous
every
girl
found
herself
at
home
here
there
were
concealed
holes
for
all
their
lovers
placed
them
over
beams
behind
the
timber
in
the
trams
they
even
lay
elbow
to
elbow
without
troubling
about
their
neighbours
and
it
seemed
that
around
this
extinguished
engine
near
this
shaft
weary
of
disgorging
coal
there
was
a
revenge
of
creation
in
the
free
love
which
beneath
the
lash
of
instinct
planted
children
in
the
bellies
of
these
girls
who
were
yet
hardly
women
yet
a
caretaker
lived
there
old
mouque
to
whom
the
company
had
given
up
almost
beneath
the
destroyed
tower
two
rooms
which
were
constantly
threatened
by
destruction
from
the
expected
fall
of
the
last
walls
he
had
even
been
obliged
to
shore
up
a
part
of
the
roof
and
he
lived
there
very
comfortably
with
his
family
he
and
mouquet
in
one
room
mouquette
in
the
other
as
the
windows
no
longer
possessed
a
single
pane
he
had
decided
to
close
them
by
nailing
up
boards
one
could
not
see
well
but
it
was
warm
for
the
rest
this
caretaker
cared
for
nothing
he
went
to
look
after
his
horses
at
the
voreux
and
never
troubled
himself
about
the
ruins
of
réquillart
of
which
the
shaft
only
was
preserved
in
order
to
serve
as
a
chimney
for
a
fire
which
ventilated
the
neighbouring
pit
it
was
thus
that
father
mouque
was
ending
his
old
age
in
the
midst
of
love
ever
since
she
was
ten
mouquette
had
been
lying
about
in
all
the
corners
of
the
ruins
not
as
a
timid
and
still
green
little
urchin
like
lydie
but
as
a
girl
who
was
already
big
and
a
mate
for
bearded
lads
the
father
had
nothing
to
say
for
she
was
considerate
and
never
introduced
a
lover
into
the
house
then
he
was
used
to
this
sort
of
accident
when
he
went
to
the
voreux
when
he
came
back
whenever
he
came
out
of
his
hole
he
could
scarcely
put
a
foot
down
without
treading
on
a
couple
in
the
grass
and
it
was
worse
if
he
wanted
to
gather
wood
to
heat
his
soup
or
look
for
burdocks
for
his
rabbit
at
the
other
end
of
the
enclosure
then
he
saw
one
by
one
the
voluptuous
noses
of
all
the
girls
of
montsou
rising
up
around
him
while
he
had
to
be
careful
not
to
knock
against
the
limbs
stretched
out
level
with
the
paths
besides
these
meetings
had
gradually
ceased
to
disturb
either
him
who
was
simply
taking
care
not
to
stumble
or
the
girls
whom
he
allowed
to
finish
their
affairs
going
away
with
discreet
little
steps
like
a
worthy
man
who
was
at
peace
with
the
ways
of
nature
only
just
as
they
now
knew
him
he
at
last
also
knew
them
as
one
knows
the
rascally
magpies
who
become
corrupted
in
the
in
the
garden
ah
youth
youth
how
it
goes
on
how
wild
it
is
sometimes
he
wagged
his
chin
with
silent
regret
turning
away
from
the
noisy
wantons
who
were
breathing
too
loudly
in
the
darkness
only
one
thing
put
him
out
of
temper
two
lovers
had
acquired
the
bad
habit
of
embracing
outside
his
wall
it
was
not
that
it
prevented
him
from
sleeping
but
they
leaned
against
the
wall
so
heavily
that
at
last
they
damaged
it
every
evening
old
mouque
received
a
visit
from
his
friend
father
bonnemort
who
regularly
before
dinner
took
the
same
walk
the
two
old
men
spoke
little
scarcely
exchanging
ten
words
during
the
that
they
spent
together
but
it
cheered
them
thus
to
think
over
the
days
of
old
to
chew
their
recollections
over
again
without
need
to
talk
of
them
at
réquillart
they
sat
on
a
beam
side
by
side
saying
a
word
and
then
sinking
into
their
dreams
with
faces
bent
towards
the
earth
no
doubt
they
were
becoming
young
again
around
them
lovers
were
turning
over
their
sweethearts
there
was
a
murmur
of
kisses
and
laughter
the
warm
odour
of
the
girls
arose
in
the
freshness
of
the
trodden
grass
it
was
now
years
since
father
bonnemort
had
taken
his
wife
behind
the
pit
she
was
a
putter
so
slight
that
he
had
placed
her
on
a
tram
to
embrace
her
at
ease
ah
those
were
fine
days
and
the
two
old
men
shaking
their
heads
at
last
left
each
other
often
without
saying
good
night
that
evening
however
as
étienne
arrived
father
bonnemort
who
was
getting
up
from
the
beam
to
return
to
the
settlement
said
to
mouque
good
night
old
man
i
say
you
knew
roussie
mouque
was
silent
for
a
moment
rocked
his
shoulders
then
returning
to
the
house
good
night
good
night
old
man
étienne
came
and
sat
on
the
beam
in
his
turn
his
sadness
was
increasing
though
he
could
not
tell
why
the
old
man
whose
disappearing
back
he
watched
recalled
his
arrival
in
the
morning
and
the
flood
of
words
which
the
piercing
wind
had
dragged
from
his
silence
what
wretchedness
and
all
these
girls
worn
out
with
fatigue
who
were
still
stupid
enough
in
the
evening
to
fabricate
little
ones
to
yield
flesh
for
labour
and
suffering
it
would
never
come
to
an
end
if
they
were
always
filling
themselves
with
starvelings
would
it
not
be
better
if
they
were
to
shut
up
their
bellies
and
press
their
thighs
together
as
at
the
approach
of
misfortune
perhaps
these
gloomy
ideas
only
stirred
confusedly
in
him
because
he
was
alone
while
all
the
others
at
this
hour
were
going
about
taking
their
pleasure
in
couples
the
mild
weather
stifled
him
a
little
occasional
drops
of
rain
fell
on
his
feverish
hands
yes
they
all
came
to
it
it
was
something
stronger
than
reason
just
then
as
étienne
remained
seated
motionless
in
the
shadow
a
couple
who
came
down
from
montsou
rustled
against
him
without
seeing
him
as
they
entered
the
uneven
réquillart
ground
the
girl
certainly
a
virgin
was
struggling
and
resisting
with
low
whispered
supplications
while
the
lad
in
silence
was
pushing
her
towards
the
darkness
of
a
corner
of
the
shed
still
upright
under
which
there
were
piles
of
old
mouldy
rope
it
was
catherine
and
big
chaval
but
étienne
had
not
recognized
them
in
passing
and
his
eyes
followed
them
he
was
watching
for
the
end
of
the
story
touched
by
a
sensuality
which
changed
the
course
of
his
thoughts
why
should
he
interfere
when
girls
refuse
it
is
because
they
like
first
to
be
forced
on
leaving
the
settlement
of
the
catherine
had
gone
to
montsou
along
the
road
from
the
age
of
ten
since
she
had
earned
her
living
at
the
pit
she
went
about
the
country
alone
in
the
complete
liberty
of
the
colliers
families
and
if
no
man
had
possessed
her
at
fifteen
it
was
owing
to
the
tardy
awakening
of
her
puberty
the
crisis
of
which
had
not
yet
arrived
when
she
was
in
front
of
the
yards
she
crossed
the
road
and
entered
a
laundress
where
she
was
certain
to
find
mouquette
for
the
latter
stayed
there
from
morning
till
night
among
women
who
treated
each
other
with
coffee
all
round
but
she
was
disappointed
mouquette
had
just
then
been
regaling
them
in
her
turn
so
thoroughly
that
she
was
not
able
to
lend
the
she
had
promised
to
console
her
they
vainly
offered
a
glass
of
hot
coffee
she
was
not
even
willing
that
her
companion
should
borrow
from
another
woman
an
idea
of
economy
had
come
to
her
a
sort
of
superstitious
fear
the
certainty
that
that
ribbon
would
bring
her
bad
luck
if
she
were
to
buy
it
now
she
hastened
to
regain
the
road
to
the
settlement
and
had
reached
the
last
houses
of
montsou
when
a
man
at
the
door
of
the
piquette
estaminet
called
her
eh
catherine
where
are
you
off
to
so
quick
it
was
lanky
chaval
she
was
vexed
not
because
he
displeased
her
but
because
she
was
not
inclined
to
joke
come
in
and
have
a
drink
a
little
glass
of
sweet
wo
you
she
refused
politely
the
night
was
coming
on
they
were
expecting
her
at
home
he
had
advanced
and
was
entreating
her
in
a
low
voice
in
the
middle
of
the
road
it
had
been
his
idea
for
a
long
time
to
persuade
her
to
come
up
to
the
room
which
he
occupied
on
the
first
story
of
the
estaminet
piquette
a
fine
room
for
a
household
with
a
large
bed
did
he
frighten
her
that
she
always
refused
she
laughed
and
said
that
she
would
come
up
some
day
when
children
did
grow
then
one
thing
leading
to
another
she
told
him
without
knowing
how
about
the
blue
ribbon
which
she
had
not
been
able
to
buy
but
i
pay
for
it
he
exclaimed
she
blushed
feeling
that
it
would
be
best
to
refuse
again
but
possessed
by
a
strong
desire
to
have
the
ribbon
the
idea
of
a
loan
came
back
to
her
and
at
last
she
accepted
on
condition
that
she
should
return
to
him
what
he
spent
on
her
they
began
to
joke
again
it
was
agreed
that
if
she
did
not
sleep
with
him
she
should
return
him
the
money
but
there
was
another
difficulty
when
he
talked
of
going
to
maigrat
no
not
maigrat
mother
wo
let
me
why
is
there
any
need
to
say
where
one
goes
he
has
the
best
ribbons
in
montsou
when
maigrat
saw
lanky
chaval
and
catherine
coming
to
his
shop
like
two
lovers
who
are
buying
their
engagement
gifts
he
became
very
red
and
exhibited
his
pieces
of
blue
ribbon
with
the
rage
of
a
man
who
is
being
made
fun
of
then
when
he
had
served
the
young
people
he
planted
himself
at
the
door
to
watch
them
disappear
in
the
twilight
and
when
his
wife
came
to
ask
him
a
question
in
a
timid
voice
he
fell
on
her
abusing
her
and
exclaiming
that
he
would
make
them
repent
some
day
the
filthy
creatures
who
had
no
gratitude
when
they
ought
all
to
be
on
the
ground
licking
his
feet
lanky
chaval
accompanied
catherine
along
the
road
he
walked
beside
her
swinging
his
arms
only
he
pushed
her
by
the
hip
conducting
her
without
seeming
to
do
so
she
suddenly
perceived
that
he
had
made
her
leave
the
pavement
and
that
they
were
taking
the
narrow
réquillart
road
but
she
had
no
time
to
be
angry
his
arm
was
already
round
her
waist
and
he
was
dazing
her
with
a
constant
caress
of
words
how
stupid
she
was
to
be
afraid
did
he
want
to
hurt
such
a
little
darling
who
was
as
soft
as
silk
so
tender
that
he
could
have
devoured
her
and
he
breathed
behind
her
ear
in
her
neck
so
that
a
shudder
passed
over
the
skin
of
her
whole
body
she
felt
stifled
and
had
nothing
to
reply
it
was
true
that
he
seemed
to
love
her
on
saturday
evenings
after
having
blown
out
the
candle
she
had
asked
herself
what
would
happen
if
he
were
to
take
her
in
this
way
then
on
going
to
sleep
she
had
dreamed
that
she
would
no
longer
refuse
quite
overcome
by
pleasure
why
then
at
the
same
idea
did
she
feel
repugnance
and
something
like
regret
while
he
was
tickling
her
neck
with
his
moustache
so
softly
that
she
closed
her
eyes
the
shadow
of
another
man
of
the
lad
she
had
seen
that
morning
passed
over
the
darkness
of
her
closed
eyelids
catherine
suddenly
looked
around
her
chaval
had
conducted
her
into
the
ruins
of
réquillart
and
she
recoiled
shuddering
from
the
darkness
of
the
fallen
shed
oh
no
oh
no
she
murmured
please
let
me
go
the
fear
of
the
male
had
taken
hold
of
her
that
fear
which
stiffens
the
muscles
in
an
impulse
of
defence
even
when
girls
are
willing
and
feel
the
conquering
approach
of
man
her
virginity
which
had
nothing
to
learn
took
fright
as
at
a
threatening
blow
a
wound
of
which
she
feared
the
unknown
pain
no
no
i
do
want
to
i
tell
you
that
i
am
too
young
it
true
another
time
when
i
am
quite
grown
up
he
growled
in
a
low
voice
stupid
there
nothing
to
fear
what
does
that
matter
but
without
speaking
more
he
had
seized
her
firmly
and
pushed
her
beneath
the
shed
and
she
fell
on
her
back
on
the
old
ropes
she
ceased
to
protest
yielding
to
the
male
before
her
time
with
that
hereditary
submission
which
from
childhood
had
thrown
down
in
the
open
air
all
the
girls
of
her
race
her
frightened
stammering
grew
faint
and
only
the
ardent
breath
of
the
man
was
heard
étienne
however
had
listened
without
moving
another
who
was
taking
the
leap
and
now
that
he
had
seen
the
comedy
he
got
up
overcome
by
uneasiness
by
a
kind
of
jealous
excitement
in
which
there
was
a
touch
of
anger
he
no
longer
restrained
himself
he
stepped
over
the
beams
for
those
two
were
too
much
occupied
now
to
be
disturbed
he
was
surprised
therefore
when
he
had
gone
a
hundred
paces
along
the
path
to
find
that
they
were
already
standing
up
and
that
they
appeared
like
himself
to
be
returning
to
the
settlement
the
man
again
had
his
arm
round
the
girl
waist
and
was
squeezing
her
with
an
air
of
gratitude
still
speaking
in
her
neck
and
it
was
she
who
seemed
in
a
hurry
anxious
to
return
quickly
and
annoyed
at
the
delay
then
étienne
was
tormented
by
the
desire
to
see
their
faces
it
was
foolish
and
he
hastened
his
steps
so
as
not
to
yield
to
it
but
his
feet
slackened
of
their
own
accord
and
at
the
first
lamppost
he
concealed
himself
in
the
shade
he
was
petrified
by
horror
when
he
recognized
catherine
and
lanky
chaval
he
hesitated
at
first
was
it
indeed
she
that
young
girl
in
the
coarse
blue
dress
with
that
bonnet
was
that
the
urchin
whom
he
had
seen
in
breeches
with
her
head
in
the
canvas
cap
that
was
why
she
could
pass
so
near
him
without
his
recognizing
her
but
he
no
longer
doubted
he
had
seen
her
eyes
again
with
their
greenish
limpidity
of
spring
water
so
clear
and
so
deep
what
a
wench
and
he
experienced
a
furious
desire
to
avenge
himself
on
her
with
contempt
without
any
motive
besides
he
did
not
like
her
as
a
girl
she
was
frightful
catherine
and
chaval
had
passed
him
slowly
they
did
not
know
that
they
were
watched
he
held
her
to
kiss
her
behind
the
ear
and
she
began
to
slacken
her
steps
beneath
his
caresses
which
made
her
laugh
left
behind
étienne
was
obliged
to
follow
them
irritated
because
they
barred
the
road
and
because
in
spite
of
himself
he
had
to
witness
these
things
which
exasperated
him
it
was
true
then
what
she
had
sworn
to
him
in
the
morning
she
was
not
any
one
mistress
and
he
who
had
not
believed
her
who
had
deprived
himself
of
her
in
order
not
to
act
like
the
other
and
who
had
let
her
be
taken
beneath
his
nose
pushing
his
stupidity
so
far
as
to
be
dirtily
amused
at
seeing
them
it
made
him
mad
he
clenched
his
hands
he
could
have
devoured
that
man
in
one
of
those
impulses
to
kill
in
which
he
saw
everything
red
the
walk
lasted
for
half
an
hour
when
chaval
and
catherine
approached
the
voreux
they
slackened
their
pace
still
more
they
stopped
twice
beside
the
canal
three
times
along
the
very
cheerful
now
and
occupied
with
little
tender
games
étienne
was
obliged
to
stop
also
when
they
stopped
for
fear
of
being
perceived
he
endeavoured
to
feel
nothing
but
a
brutal
regret
that
would
teach
him
to
treat
girls
with
consideration
through
being
well
brought
up
then
after
passing
the
voreux
and
at
last
free
to
go
and
dine
at
rasseneur
he
continued
to
follow
them
accompanying
them
to
the
settlement
where
he
remained
standing
in
the
shade
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
waiting
until
chaval
left
catherine
to
enter
her
home
and
when
he
was
quite
sure
that
they
were
no
longer
together
he
set
off
walking
afresh
going
very
far
along
the
marchiennes
road
stamping
and
thinking
of
nothing
too
stifled
and
too
sad
to
shut
himself
up
in
a
room
it
was
not
until
an
hour
later
towards
nine
that
étienne
again
passed
the
settlement
saying
to
himself
that
he
must
eat
and
sleep
if
he
was
to
be
up
again
at
four
in
the
morning
the
village
was
already
asleep
and
looked
quite
black
in
the
night
not
a
gleam
shone
from
the
closed
shutters
the
house
fronts
slept
with
the
heavy
sleep
of
snoring
barracks
only
a
cat
escaped
through
the
empty
gardens
it
was
the
end
of
the
day
the
collapse
of
workers
falling
from
the
table
to
the
bed
overcome
with
weariness
and
food
at
rasseneur
in
the
lighted
room
an
and
two
were
drinking
but
before
going
in
étienne
stopped
to
throw
one
last
glance
into
the
darkness
he
saw
again
the
same
black
immensity
as
in
the
morning
when
he
had
arrived
in
the
wind
before
him
the
voreux
was
crouching
with
its
air
of
an
evil
beast
its
dimness
pricked
with
a
few
lantern
lights
the
three
braziers
of
the
bank
were
burning
in
the
air
like
bloody
moons
now
and
then
showing
the
vast
silhouettes
of
father
bonnemort
and
his
yellow
horse
and
beyond
in
the
flat
plain
shade
had
submerged
everything
montsou
marchiennes
the
forest
of
vandame
the
immense
sea
of
beetroot
and
of
wheat
in
which
there
only
shone
like
distant
lighthouses
the
blue
fires
of
the
blast
furnaces
and
the
red
fires
of
the
coke
ovens
gradually
the
night
came
on
the
rain
was
now
falling
slowly
continuously
burying
this
void
in
its
monotonous
streaming
only
one
voice
was
still
heard
the
thick
slow
respiration
of
the
pumping
engine
breathing
both
by
day
and
by
night
part
three
chapter
i
on
the
next
day
and
the
days
that
followed
étienne
continued
his
work
at
the
pit
he
grew
accustomed
to
it
his
existence
became
regulated
by
this
labour
and
to
these
new
habits
which
had
seemed
so
hard
to
him
at
first
only
one
episode
interrupted
the
monotony
of
the
first
fortnight
a
slight
fever
which
kept
him
in
bed
for
hours
with
aching
limbs
and
throbbing
head
dreaming
in
a
state
of
that
he
was
pushing
his
tram
in
a
passage
that
was
so
narrow
that
his
body
would
not
pass
through
it
was
simply
the
exhaustion
of
his
apprenticeship
an
excess
of
fatigue
from
which
he
quickly
recovered
and
days
followed
days
until
weeks
and
months
had
slipped
by
now
like
his
mates
he
got
up
at
three
drank
his
coffee
and
carried
off
the
double
slice
of
bread
and
butter
which
madame
rasseneur
had
prepared
for
him
the
evening
before
regularly
as
he
went
every
morning
to
the
pit
he
met
old
bonnemort
who
was
going
home
to
sleep
and
on
leaving
in
the
afternoon
he
crossed
bouteloup
who
was
going
to
his
task
he
had
his
cap
his
breeches
and
canvas
jacket
and
he
shivered
and
warmed
his
back
in
the
shed
before
the
large
fire
then
came
the
waiting
with
naked
feet
in
the
swept
by
furious
currents
of
air
but
the
engine
with
its
great
steel
limbs
starred
with
copper
shining
up
above
in
the
shade
no
longer
attracted
his
attention
nor
the
cables
which
flew
by
with
the
black
and
silent
motion
of
a
nocturnal
bird
nor
the
cages
rising
and
plunging
unceasingly
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
of
signals
of
shouted
orders
of
trams
shaking
the
metal
floor
his
lamp
burnt
badly
that
confounded
could
not
have
cleaned
it
and
he
only
woke
up
when
mouquet
bundled
them
all
off
roguishly
smacking
the
girls
flanks
the
cage
was
unfastened
and
fell
like
a
stone
to
the
bottom
of
a
hole
without
causing
him
even
to
lift
his
head
to
see
the
daylight
vanish
he
never
thought
of
a
possible
fall
he
felt
himself
at
home
as
he
sank
into
the
darkness
beneath
the
falling
rain
below
at
the
when
pierron
had
unloaded
them
with
his
air
of
hypocritical
mildness
there
was
always
the
same
tramping
as
of
a
flock
the
each
going
away
to
his
cutting
with
trailing
steps
he
now
knew
the
mine
galleries
better
than
the
streets
of
montsou
he
knew
where
he
had
to
turn
where
he
had
to
stoop
and
where
he
had
to
avoid
a
puddle
he
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
these
two
kilometres
beneath
the
earth
that
he
could
have
traversed
them
without
a
lamp
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
every
time
the
same
meetings
took
place
a
captain
lighting
up
the
faces
of
the
passing
workmen
father
mouque
leading
a
horse
bébert
conducting
the
snorting
bataille
jeanlin
running
behind
the
tram
to
close
the
ventilation
doors
and
big
mouquette
and
lean
lydie
pushing
their
trams
after
a
time
also
étienne
suffered
much
less
from
the
damp
and
closeness
of
the
cutting
the
chimney
or
ascending
passage
seemed
to
him
more
convenient
for
climbing
up
as
if
he
had
melted
and
could
pass
through
cracks
where
before
he
would
not
have
risked
a
hand
he
breathed
the
without
difficulty
saw
clearly
in
the
obscurity
and
sweated
tranquilly
having
grown
accustomed
to
the
sensation
of
wet
garments
on
his
body
from
morning
to
night
besides
he
no
longer
spent
his
energy
recklessly
he
had
gained
skill
so
rapidly
that
he
astonished
the
whole
stall
in
three
weeks
he
was
named
among
the
best
putters
in
the
pit
no
one
pushed
a
tram
more
rapidly
to
the
upbrow
nor
loaded
it
afterwards
so
correctly
his
small
figure
allowed
him
to
slip
about
everywhere
and
though
his
arms
were
as
delicate
and
white
as
a
woman
they
seemed
to
be
made
of
iron
beneath
the
smooth
skin
so
vigorously
did
they
perform
their
task
he
never
complained
out
of
pride
no
doubt
even
when
he
was
panting
with
fatigue
the
only
thing
they
had
against
him
was
that
he
could
not
take
a
joke
and
grew
angry
as
soon
as
any
one
trod
on
his
toes
in
all
other
respects
he
was
accepted
and
looked
upon
as
a
real
miner
reduced
beneath
this
pressure
of
habit
little
by
little
to
a
machine
maheu
regarded
étienne
with
special
friendship
for
he
respected
work
that
was
well
done
then
like
the
others
he
felt
that
this
lad
had
more
education
than
himself
he
saw
him
read
write
and
draw
little
plans
he
heard
him
talking
of
things
of
which
he
himself
did
not
know
even
the
existence
this
caused
him
no
astonishment
for
miners
are
rough
fellows
who
have
thicker
heads
than
but
he
was
surprised
at
the
courage
of
this
little
chap
and
at
the
cheerful
way
he
had
bitten
into
the
coal
to
avoid
dying
of
hunger
he
had
never
met
a
workman
who
grew
accustomed
to
it
so
quickly
so
when
hewing
was
urgent
and
he
did
not
wish
to
disturb
a
pikeman
he
gave
the
timbering
over
to
the
young
man
being
sure
of
the
neatness
and
solidity
of
his
work
the
bosses
were
always
bothering
him
about
the
damned
planking
question
he
feared
every
hour
the
appearance
of
the
engineer
négrel
followed
by
dansaert
shouting
discussing
ordering
everything
to
be
done
over
again
and
he
remarked
that
his
putter
timbering
gave
greater
satisfaction
to
these
gentlemen
in
spite
of
their
air
of
never
being
pleased
with
anything
and
their
repeated
assertions
that
the
company
would
one
day
or
another
take
radical
measures
things
dragged
on
a
deep
discontent
was
fomenting
in
the
pit
and
maheu
himself
in
spite
of
his
calmness
was
beginning
to
clench
his
fists
there
was
at
first
some
rivalry
between
zacharie
and
étienne
one
evening
they
were
even
coming
to
blows
but
the
former
a
good
lad
though
careless
of
everything
but
his
own
pleasure
was
quickly
appeased
by
the
friendly
offer
of
a
glass
and
soon
yielded
to
the
superiority
of
the
levaque
was
also
on
good
terms
with
him
talking
politics
with
the
putter
who
as
he
said
had
his
own
ideas
the
only
one
of
the
men
in
whom
he
felt
a
deep
hostility
was
lanky
chaval
not
that
they
were
cool
towards
each
other
for
on
the
contrary
they
had
become
companions
only
when
they
joked
their
eyes
seemed
to
devour
each
other
catherine
continued
to
move
among
them
as
a
tired
resigned
girl
bending
her
back
pushing
her
tram
always
with
her
companion
in
the
putting
who
aided
her
in
his
turn
and
submissive
to
the
wishes
of
her
lover
whose
caresses
she
now
received
openly
it
was
an
accepted
situation
a
recognized
domestic
arrangement
to
which
the
family
itself
closed
its
eyes
to
such
a
degree
that
chaval
every
evening
led
away
the
putter
behind
the
then
brought
her
back
to
her
parents
door
where
he
finally
embraced
her
before
the
whole
settlement
étienne
who
believed
that
he
had
reconciled
himself
to
the
situation
often
teased
her
about
these
walks
making
crude
remarks
by
way
of
joke
as
lads
and
girls
will
at
the
bottom
of
the
cuttings
and
she
replied
in
the
same
tone
telling
in
a
swaggering
way
what
her
lover
had
done
to
her
yet
disturbed
and
growing
pale
when
the
young
man
eyes
chanced
to
meet
hers
then
both
would
turn
away
their
heads
not
speaking
again
perhaps
for
an
hour
looking
as
if
they
hated
each
other
because
of
something
buried
within
them
and
which
they
could
never
explain
to
each
other
the
spring
had
come
on
emerging
from
the
pit
one
day
étienne
had
received
in
his
face
a
warm
april
breeze
a
good
odour
of
young
earth
of
tender
greenness
of
large
open
air
and
now
every
time
he
came
up
the
spring
smelt
sweeter
warmed
him
more
after
his
ten
hours
of
labour
in
the
eternal
winter
at
the
bottom
in
the
midst
of
that
damp
darkness
which
no
summer
had
ever
dissipated
the
days
grew
longer
and
longer
at
last
in
may
he
went
down
at
sunrise
when
a
vermilion
sky
lit
up
the
voreux
with
a
mist
of
dawn
in
which
the
white
vapour
of
the
became
there
was
no
more
shivering
a
warm
breath
blew
across
the
plain
while
the
larks
sang
far
above
then
at
three
he
was
dazzled
by
the
now
burning
sun
which
set
fire
to
the
horizon
and
reddened
the
bricks
beneath
the
filth
of
the
coal
in
june
the
wheat
was
already
high
of
a
blue
green
which
contrasted
with
the
black
green
of
the
beetroots
it
was
an
endless
vista
undulating
beneath
the
slightest
breeze
and
he
saw
it
spread
and
grow
from
day
to
day
and
was
sometimes
surprised
as
if
he
had
found
it
in
the
evening
more
swollen
with
verdure
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning
the
poplars
along
the
canal
were
putting
on
their
plumes
of
leaves
grass
was
invading
the
flowers
were
covering
the
meadows
a
whole
life
was
germinating
and
pushing
up
from
this
earth
beneath
which
he
was
groaning
in
misery
and
fatigue
when
étienne
now
went
for
a
walk
in
the
evening
he
no
longer
startled
lovers
behind
the
he
could
follow
their
track
in
the
wheat
and
divine
their
wanton
birds
nests
by
eddies
among
the
yellowing
blades
and
the
great
red
poppies
zacharie
and
philoméne
came
back
to
it
out
of
old
domestic
habit
mother
brulé
always
on
lydie
heels
was
constantly
hunting
her
out
with
jeanlin
buried
so
deeply
together
that
one
had
to
tread
on
them
before
they
made
up
their
minds
to
get
up
and
as
to
mouquette
she
lay
about
everywhere
one
could
not
cross
a
field
without
seeing
her
head
plunge
down
while
only
her
feet
emerged
as
she
lay
at
full
length
but
all
these
were
quite
free
the
young
man
found
nothing
guilty
there
except
on
the
evenings
when
he
met
catherine
and
chaval
twice
he
saw
them
on
his
approach
tumble
down
in
the
midst
of
a
field
where
the
motionless
stalks
afterwards
remained
dead
another
time
as
he
was
going
along
a
narrow
path
catherine
clear
eyes
appeared
before
him
level
with
the
wheat
and
immediately
sank
then
the
immense
plain
seemed
to
him
too
small
and
he
preferred
to
pass
the
evening
at
rasseneur
in
the
avantage
give
me
a
glass
madame
rasseneur
no
i
not
going
out
my
legs
are
too
stiff
and
he
turned
towards
a
comrade
who
always
sat
at
the
bottom
table
with
his
head
against
the
wall
souvarine
wo
you
have
one
no
thanks
nothing
étienne
had
become
acquainted
with
souvarine
through
living
there
side
by
side
he
was
an
at
the
voreux
and
occupied
the
furnished
room
upstairs
next
to
his
own
he
must
have
been
about
thirty
years
old
fair
and
slender
with
a
delicate
face
framed
by
thick
hair
and
a
slight
beard
his
white
pointed
teeth
his
thin
mouth
and
nose
with
his
rosy
complexion
gave
him
a
girlish
appearance
an
air
of
obstinate
gentleness
across
which
the
grey
reflection
of
his
steely
eyes
threw
savage
gleams
in
his
poor
workman
room
there
was
nothing
but
a
box
of
papers
and
books
he
was
a
russian
and
never
spoke
of
himself
so
that
many
stories
were
afloat
concerning
him
the
colliers
who
are
very
suspicious
with
strangers
guessing
from
his
small
hands
that
he
belonged
to
another
caste
had
at
first
imagined
a
romance
some
assassination
and
that
he
was
escaping
punishment
but
then
he
had
behaved
in
such
a
fraternal
way
with
them
without
any
pride
distributing
to
the
youngsters
of
the
settlement
all
the
sous
in
his
pockets
that
they
now
accepted
him
reassured
by
the
term
political
refugee
which
circulated
about
him
a
vague
term
in
which
they
saw
an
excuse
even
for
crime
and
as
it
were
a
companionship
in
suffering
during
the
first
weeks
étienne
had
found
him
timid
and
reserved
so
that
he
only
discovered
his
history
later
on
souvarine
was
the
latest
born
of
a
noble
family
in
the
government
of
tula
at
petersburg
where
he
studied
medicine
the
socialistic
enthusiasm
which
then
carried
away
all
the
youth
in
russia
had
decided
him
to
learn
a
manual
trade
that
of
a
mechanic
so
that
he
could
mix
with
the
people
in
order
to
know
them
and
help
them
as
a
brother
and
it
was
by
this
trade
that
he
was
now
living
after
having
fled
in
consequence
of
an
unsuccessful
attempt
against
the
tsar
life
for
a
month
he
had
lived
in
a
fruiterer
cellar
hollowing
out
a
mine
underneath
the
road
and
charging
bombs
with
the
constant
risk
of
being
blown
up
with
the
house
renounced
by
his
family
without
money
expelled
from
the
french
workshops
as
a
foreigner
who
was
regarded
as
a
spy
he
was
dying
of
starvation
when
the
montsou
company
had
at
last
taken
him
on
at
a
moment
of
pressure
for
a
year
he
had
laboured
there
as
a
good
sober
silent
workman
doing
one
week
and
the
next
week
so
regularly
that
the
masters
referred
to
him
as
an
example
to
the
others
are
you
never
thirsty
said
étienne
to
him
laughing
and
he
replied
with
his
gentle
voice
almost
without
an
accent
i
am
thirsty
when
i
eat
his
companion
also
joked
him
about
the
girls
declaring
that
he
had
seen
him
with
a
putter
in
the
wheat
on
the
side
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
tranquil
indifference
what
should
he
do
with
a
putter
woman
was
for
him
a
boy
a
comrade
when
she
had
the
fraternal
feeling
and
the
courage
of
a
man
what
was
the
good
of
having
a
possible
act
of
cowardice
on
one
conscience
he
desired
no
bond
either
woman
or
friend
he
would
be
master
of
his
own
life
and
those
of
others
every
evening
towards
nine
when
the
inn
was
emptying
étienne
remained
thus
talking
with
souvarine
he
drank
his
beer
in
small
sips
while
the
smoked
constant
cigarettes
of
which
the
tobacco
had
at
last
stained
his
slender
fingers
his
vague
eyes
followed
the
smoke
in
the
midst
of
a
dream
his
left
hand
sought
occupation
by
nervously
twitching
and
he
usually
ended
by
installing
a
tame
rabbit
on
his
knees
a
large
doe
with
young
who
lived
at
liberty
in
the
house
this
rabbit
which
he
had
named
poland
had
grown
to
worship
him
she
would
come
and
smell
his
trousers
fawn
on
him
and
scratch
him
with
her
paws
until
he
took
her
up
like
a
child
then
lying
in
a
heap
against
him
her
ears
laid
back
she
would
close
her
eyes
and
without
growing
tired
with
an
unconscious
caressing
gesture
he
would
pass
his
hand
over
her
grey
silky
fur
calmed
by
that
warm
living
softness
you
know
i
have
had
a
letter
from
pluchart
said
étienne
one
evening
only
rasseneur
was
there
the
last
client
had
departed
for
the
settlement
which
was
now
going
to
bed
ah
exclaimed
the
innkeeper
standing
up
before
his
two
lodgers
how
are
things
going
with
pluchart
during
the
last
two
months
étienne
had
kept
up
a
constant
correspondence
with
the
lille
mechanician
whom
he
had
told
of
his
montsou
engagement
and
who
was
now
indoctrinating
him
having
been
struck
by
the
propaganda
which
he
might
carry
on
among
the
miners
the
association
is
getting
on
very
well
it
seems
that
they
are
coming
in
from
all
sides
what
have
you
got
to
say
eh
about
their
society
asked
rasseneur
of
souvarine
the
latter
who
was
softly
scratching
poland
head
blew
out
a
puff
of
smoke
and
muttered
with
his
tranquil
air
more
foolery
but
étienne
grew
enthusiastic
a
predisposition
for
revolt
was
throwing
him
in
the
first
illusions
of
his
ignorance
into
the
struggle
of
labour
against
capital
it
was
the
international
working
association
that
they
were
concerned
with
that
famous
international
which
had
just
been
founded
in
london
was
not
that
a
superb
effort
a
campaign
in
which
justice
would
at
last
triumph
no
more
frontiers
the
workers
of
the
whole
world
rising
and
uniting
to
assure
to
the
labourer
the
bread
that
he
has
earned
and
what
a
simple
and
great
organization
below
the
section
which
represents
the
commune
then
the
federation
which
groups
the
sections
of
the
same
province
then
the
nation
and
then
at
last
humanity
incarnated
in
a
general
council
in
which
each
nation
was
represented
by
a
corresponding
secretary
in
six
months
it
would
conquer
the
world
and
would
be
able
to
dictate
laws
to
the
masters
should
they
prove
obstinate
foolery
repeated
souvarine
your
karl
marx
is
still
only
thinking
about
letting
natural
forces
act
no
politics
no
conspiracies
is
it
not
so
everything
in
the
light
of
day
and
simply
to
raise
wages
do
bother
me
with
your
evolution
set
fire
to
the
four
corners
of
the
town
mow
down
the
people
level
everything
and
when
there
is
nothing
more
of
this
rotten
world
left
standing
perhaps
a
better
one
will
grow
up
in
its
place
étienne
began
to
laugh
he
did
not
always
take
in
his
sayings
this
theory
of
destruction
seemed
to
him
an
affectation
rasseneur
who
was
still
more
practical
like
a
man
of
solid
common
sense
did
not
condescend
to
get
angry
he
only
wanted
to
have
things
clear
then
what
are
you
going
to
try
and
create
a
section
at
montsou
this
was
what
was
desired
by
pluchart
who
was
secretary
to
the
federation
of
the
nord
he
insisted
especially
on
the
services
which
the
association
would
render
to
the
miners
should
they
go
out
on
strike
étienne
believed
that
a
strike
was
imminent
this
timbering
business
would
turn
out
badly
any
further
demands
on
the
part
of
the
company
would
cause
rebellion
in
all
the
pits
it
the
subscriptions
that
are
the
nuisance
rasseneur
declared
in
a
judicial
tone
half
a
franc
a
year
for
the
general
fund
two
francs
for
the
section
it
looks
like
nothing
but
i
bet
that
many
will
refuse
to
give
it
all
the
more
added
étienne
because
we
must
first
have
here
a
provident
fund
which
we
can
use
if
need
be
as
an
emergency
fund
no
matter
it
is
time
to
think
about
these
things
i
am
ready
if
the
others
are
there
was
silence
the
petroleum
lamp
smoked
on
the
counter
through
the
large
open
door
they
could
distinctly
hear
the
shovel
of
a
stoker
at
the
voreux
stoking
the
engine
everything
is
so
dear
began
madame
rasseneur
who
had
entered
and
was
listening
with
a
gloomy
air
as
if
she
had
grown
up
in
her
everlasting
black
dress
when
i
tell
you
that
i
paid
sous
for
eggs
it
will
have
to
burst
up
all
three
men
this
time
were
of
the
same
opinion
they
spoke
one
after
the
other
in
a
despairing
voice
giving
expression
to
their
complaints
the
workers
could
not
hold
out
the
revolution
had
only
aggravated
their
wretchedness
only
the
bourgeois
had
grown
fat
since
so
greedily
that
they
had
not
even
left
the
bottom
of
the
plates
to
lick
who
could
say
that
the
workers
had
had
their
reasonable
share
in
the
extraordinary
increase
of
wealth
and
comfort
during
the
last
hundred
years
they
had
made
fun
of
them
by
declaring
them
free
yes
free
to
starve
a
freedom
of
which
they
fully
availed
themselves
it
put
no
bread
into
your
cupboard
to
go
and
vote
for
fine
fellows
who
went
away
and
enjoyed
themselves
thinking
no
more
of
the
wretched
voters
than
of
their
old
boots
no
one
way
or
another
it
would
have
to
come
to
an
end
either
quietly
by
laws
by
an
understanding
in
good
fellowship
or
like
savages
by
burning
everything
and
devouring
one
another
even
if
they
never
saw
it
their
children
would
certainly
see
it
for
the
century
could
not
come
to
an
end
without
another
revolution
that
of
the
workers
this
time
a
general
hustling
which
would
cleanse
society
from
top
to
bottom
and
rebuild
it
with
more
cleanliness
and
justice
it
will
have
to
burst
up
madame
rasseneur
repeated
energetically
yes
yes
they
all
three
cried
it
will
have
to
burst
up
souvarine
was
now
tickling
poland
ears
and
her
nose
was
curling
with
pleasure
he
said
in
a
low
voice
with
abstracted
gaze
as
if
to
himself
raise
wages
how
can
you
they
fixed
by
an
iron
law
to
the
smallest
possible
sum
just
the
sum
necessary
to
allow
the
workers
to
eat
dry
bread
and
get
children
if
they
fall
too
low
the
workers
die
and
the
demand
for
new
men
makes
them
rise
if
they
rise
too
high
more
men
come
and
they
fall
it
is
the
balance
of
empty
bellies
a
sentence
to
a
perpetual
prison
of
hunger
when
he
thus
forgot
himself
entering
into
the
questions
that
stir
an
educated
socialist
étienne
and
rasseneur
became
restless
disturbed
by
his
despairing
statements
which
they
were
unable
to
answer
do
you
understand
he
said
again
gazing
at
them
with
his
habitual
calmness
we
must
destroy
everything
or
hunger
will
reappear
yes
anarchy
and
nothing
more
the
earth
washed
in
blood
and
purified
by
fire
then
we
shall
see
monsieur
is
quite
right
said
madame
rasseneur
who
in
her
revolutionary
violence
was
always
very
polite
étienne
in
despair
at
his
ignorance
would
argue
no
longer
he
rose
remarking
let
go
to
bed
all
this
wo
save
one
from
getting
up
at
three
souvarine
having
blown
away
the
which
was
sticking
to
his
lips
was
already
gently
lifting
the
big
rabbit
beneath
the
belly
to
place
it
on
the
ground
rasseneur
was
shutting
up
the
house
they
separated
in
silence
with
buzzing
ears
as
if
their
heads
had
swollen
with
the
grave
questions
they
had
been
discussing
and
every
evening
there
were
similar
conversations
in
the
bare
room
around
the
single
glass
which
étienne
took
an
hour
to
empty
a
crowd
of
obscure
ideas
asleep
within
him
were
stirring
and
expanding
especially
consumed
by
the
need
of
knowledge
he
had
long
hesitated
to
borrow
books
from
his
neighbour
who
unfortunately
had
hardly
any
but
german
and
russian
works
at
last
he
had
borrowed
a
french
book
on
societies
mere
foolery
said
souvarine
and
he
also
regularly
read
a
newspaper
which
the
latter
received
the
combat
an
anarchist
journal
published
at
geneva
in
other
respects
notwithstanding
their
daily
relations
he
found
him
as
reserved
as
ever
with
his
air
of
camping
in
life
without
interests
or
feelings
or
possessions
of
any
kind
towards
the
first
days
of
july
étienne
situation
began
to
improve
in
the
midst
of
this
monotonous
life
always
beginning
over
again
an
accident
had
occurred
the
stalls
in
the
guillaume
seam
had
come
across
a
shifting
of
the
strata
a
general
disturbance
in
the
layers
which
certainly
announced
that
they
were
approaching
a
fault
and
in
fact
they
soon
came
across
this
fault
which
the
engineers
in
spite
of
considerable
knowledge
of
the
soil
were
still
ignorant
of
this
upset
the
pit
nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
lost
seam
which
was
to
be
found
no
doubt
lower
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
fault
the
old
miners
were
already
expanding
their
nostrils
like
good
dogs
in
a
chase
for
coal
but
meanwhile
the
hewers
could
not
stand
with
folded
arms
and
placards
announced
that
the
company
would
put
up
new
workings
to
auction
maheu
on
coming
out
one
day
accompanied
étienne
and
offered
to
take
him
on
as
a
pikeman
in
his
working
in
place
of
levaque
who
had
gone
to
another
yard
the
matter
had
already
been
arranged
with
the
head
captain
and
the
engineer
who
were
very
pleased
with
the
young
man
so
étienne
merely
had
to
accept
this
rapid
promotion
glad
of
the
growing
esteem
in
which
maheu
held
him
in
the
evening
they
returned
together
to
the
pit
to
take
note
of
the
placards
the
cuttings
put
up
to
auction
were
in
the
filonniére
seam
in
the
north
gallery
of
the
voreux
they
did
not
seem
very
advantageous
and
the
miner
shook
his
head
when
the
young
man
read
out
the
conditions
on
the
following
day
when
they
had
gone
down
he
took
him
to
see
the
seam
and
showed
him
how
far
away
it
was
from
the
the
crumbly
nature
of
the
earth
the
thinness
and
hardness
of
the
coal
but
if
they
were
to
eat
they
would
have
to
work
so
on
the
following
sunday
they
went
to
the
auction
which
took
place
in
the
shed
and
was
presided
over
by
the
engineer
of
the
pit
assisted
by
the
head
captain
in
the
absence
of
the
divisional
engineer
from
five
to
six
hundred
miners
were
there
in
front
of
the
little
platform
which
was
placed
in
the
corner
and
the
bidding
went
on
so
rapidly
that
one
only
heard
a
deep
tumult
of
voices
of
shouted
figures
drowned
by
other
figures
for
a
moment
maheu
feared
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
obtain
one
of
the
forty
workings
offered
by
the
company
all
the
rivals
went
lower
disquieted
by
the
rumours
of
a
crisis
and
the
panic
of
a
négrel
the
engineer
did
not
hurry
in
the
face
of
this
panic
and
allowed
the
offers
to
fall
to
the
lowest
possible
figures
while
dansaert
anxious
to
push
matters
still
further
lied
with
regard
to
the
quality
of
the
workings
in
order
to
get
his
fifty
metres
maheu
struggled
with
a
comrade
who
was
also
obstinate
in
turn
they
each
took
off
a
centime
from
the
tram
and
if
he
conquered
in
the
end
it
was
only
by
lowering
the
wage
to
such
an
extent
that
the
captain
richomme
who
was
standing
behind
him
muttered
between
his
teeth
and
nudged
him
with
his
elbow
growling
angrily
that
he
could
never
do
it
at
that
price
when
they
came
out
étienne
was
swearing
and
he
broke
out
before
chaval
who
was
returning
from
the
wheatfields
in
company
with
catherine
amusing
himself
while
his
was
absorbed
in
serious
business
by
god
he
exclaimed
it
simply
slaughter
today
it
is
the
worker
who
is
forced
to
devour
the
worker
chaval
was
furious
he
would
never
have
lowered
it
he
would
and
zacharie
who
had
come
out
of
curiosity
declared
that
it
was
disgusting
but
étienne
with
a
violent
gesture
silenced
them
it
will
end
some
day
we
shall
be
the
masters
maheu
who
had
been
mute
since
the
auction
appeared
to
wake
up
he
repeated
masters
ah
bad
luck

ca
be
too
soon
chapter
ii
it
was
montsou
the
last
sunday
in
july
since
saturday
evening
the
good
housekeepers
of
the
settlement
had
deluged
their
parlours
with
water
throwing
bucketfuls
over
the
flags
and
against
the
walls
and
the
floor
was
not
yet
dry
in
spite
of
the
white
sand
which
had
been
strewn
over
it
an
expensive
luxury
for
the
purses
of
the
poor
but
the
day
promised
to
be
very
warm
it
was
one
of
those
heavy
skies
threatening
storm
which
in
summer
stifle
this
flat
bare
country
of
the
nord
sunday
upset
the
hours
for
rising
even
among
the
maheus
while
the
father
after
five
grew
weary
of
his
bed
and
dressed
himself
the
children
lay
in
bed
until
nine
on
this
day
maheu
went
to
smoke
a
pipe
in
the
garden
and
then
came
back
to
eat
his
bread
and
butter
alone
while
waiting
he
thus
passed
the
morning
in
a
random
manner
he
mended
the
tub
which
leaked
stuck
up
beneath
the
clock
a
portrait
of
the
prince
imperial
which
had
been
given
to
the
little
ones
however
the
others
came
down
one
by
one
father
bonnemort
had
taken
a
chair
outside
to
sit
in
the
sun
while
the
mother
and
alzire
had
at
once
set
about
cooking
catherine
appeared
pushing
before
her
lénore
and
henri
whom
she
had
just
dressed
eleven
struck
and
the
odour
of
the
rabbit
which
was
boiling
with
potatoes
was
already
filling
the
house
when
zacharie
and
jeanlin
came
down
last
still
yawning
and
with
their
swollen
eyes
the
settlement
was
now
in
a
flutter
excited
by
the
and
in
expectation
of
dinner
which
was
being
hastened
for
the
departure
in
bands
to
montsou
troops
of
children
were
rushing
about
men
in
their
were
trailing
their
old
shoes
with
the
lazy
gait
of
days
of
rest
windows
and
doors
opened
wide
in
the
fine
weather
gave
glimpses
of
rows
of
parlours
which
were
filled
with
movement
and
shouts
and
the
chatter
of
families
and
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
frontages
there
was
a
smell
of
rabbit
a
rich
kitchen
smell
which
on
this
day
struggled
with
the
inveterate
odour
of
fried
onion
the
maheus
dined
at
midday
they
made
little
noise
in
the
midst
of
the
chatter
from
door
to
door
in
the
coming
and
going
of
women
in
a
constant
uproar
of
calls
and
replies
of
objects
borrowed
of
youngsters
hunted
away
or
brought
back
with
a
slap
besides
they
had
not
been
on
good
terms
during
the
last
three
weeks
with
their
neighbours
the
levaques
on
the
subject
of
the
marriage
of
zacharie
and
philoméne
the
men
passed
the
time
of
day
but
the
women
pretended
not
to
know
each
other
this
quarrel
had
strengthened
the
relations
with
pierronne
only
pierronne
had
left
pierron
and
lydie
with
her
mother
and
set
out
early
in
the
morning
to
spend
the
day
with
a
cousin
at
marchiennes
and
they
joked
for
they
knew
this
cousin
she
had
a
moustache
and
was
head
captain
at
the
voreux
maheude
declared
that
it
was
not
proper
to
leave
one
family
on
a
sunday
beside
the
rabbit
with
potatoes
a
rabbit
which
had
been
fattening
in
the
shed
for
a
month
the
maheus
had
meat
soup
and
beef
the
fortnight
wages
had
just
fallen
due
the
day
before
they
could
not
recollect
such
a
spread
even
at
the
last
barbara
day
the
fete
of
the
miners
when
they
do
nothing
for
three
days
the
rabbit
had
not
been
so
fat
nor
so
tender
so
the
ten
pairs
of
jaws
from
little
estelle
whose
teeth
were
beginning
to
appear
to
old
bonnemort
who
was
losing
his
worked
so
heartily
that
the
bones
themselves
disappeared
the
meat
was
good
but
they
could
not
digest
it
well
they
saw
it
too
seldom
everything
disappeared
there
only
remained
a
piece
of
boiled
beef
for
the
evening
they
could
add
bread
and
butter
if
they
were
hungry
jeanlin
went
out
first
bébert
was
waiting
for
him
behind
the
school
and
they
prowled
about
for
a
long
time
before
they
were
able
to
entice
away
lydie
whom
brulé
who
had
decided
not
to
go
out
was
trying
to
keep
with
her
when
she
perceived
that
the
child
had
fled
she
shouted
and
brandished
her
lean
arms
while
pierron
annoyed
at
the
disturbance
strolled
quietly
away
with
the
air
of
a
husband
who
can
amuse
himself
with
a
good
conscience
knowing
that
his
wife
also
has
her
little
amusements
old
bonnemort
set
out
at
last
and
maheu
decided
to
have
a
little
fresh
air
after
asking
maheude
if
she
would
come
and
join
him
down
below
no
she
could
at
all
it
was
nothing
but
drudgery
with
the
little
ones
but
perhaps
she
would
all
the
same
she
would
think
about
it
they
could
easily
find
each
other
when
he
got
outside
he
hesitated
then
he
went
into
the
neighbours
to
see
if
levaque
was
ready
there
he
found
zacharie
who
was
waiting
for
philoméne
and
the
levaque
woman
started
again
on
that
everlasting
subject
of
marriage
saying
that
she
was
being
made
fun
of
and
that
she
would
have
an
explanation
with
maheude
once
and
for
all
was
life
worth
living
when
one
had
to
keep
one
daughter
fatherless
children
while
she
went
off
with
her
lover
philoméne
quietly
finished
putting
on
her
bonnet
and
zacharie
took
her
off
saying
that
he
was
quite
willing
if
his
mother
was
willing
as
levaque
had
already
gone
maheu
referred
his
angry
neighbour
to
his
wife
and
hastened
to
depart
bouteloup
who
was
finishing
a
fragment
of
cheese
with
both
elbows
on
the
table
obstinately
refused
the
friendly
offer
of
a
glass
he
would
stay
in
the
house
like
a
good
husband
gradually
the
settlement
was
emptied
all
the
men
went
off
one
behind
the
other
while
the
girls
watching
at
the
doors
set
out
in
the
opposite
direction
on
the
arms
of
their
lovers
as
her
father
turned
the
corner
of
the
church
catherine
perceived
chaval
and
hastening
to
join
him
they
took
together
the
montsou
road
and
the
mother
remained
alone
in
the
midst
of
her
scattered
children
without
strength
to
leave
her
chair
where
she
was
pouring
out
a
second
glass
of
boiling
coffee
which
she
drank
in
little
sips
in
the
settlement
there
were
only
the
women
left
inviting
each
other
to
finish
the
dregs
of
the
around
tables
that
were
still
warm
and
greasy
with
the
dinner
maheu
had
guessed
that
levaque
was
at
the
avantage
and
he
slowly
went
down
to
rasseneur
in
fact
behind
the
bar
in
the
little
garden
shut
in
by
a
hedge
levaque
was
having
a
game
of
skittles
with
some
mates
standing
by
and
not
playing
father
bonnemort
and
old
mouque
were
following
the
ball
so
absorbed
that
they
even
forgot
to
nudge
each
other
with
their
elbows
a
burning
sun
struck
down
on
them
perpendicularly
there
was
only
one
streak
of
shade
by
the
side
of
the
inn
and
étienne
was
there
drinking
his
glass
before
a
table
annoyed
because
souvarine
had
just
left
him
to
go
up
to
his
room
nearly
every
sunday
the
shut
himself
up
to
write
or
to
read
will
you
have
a
game
asked
levaque
of
maheu
but
he
refused
it
was
too
hot
he
was
already
dying
of
thirst
rasseneur
called
étienne
bring
a
glass
will
you
and
turning
towards
maheu
i
stand
it
you
know
they
now
all
treated
each
other
familiarly
rasseneur
did
not
hurry
himself
he
had
to
be
called
three
times
and
madame
rasseneur
at
last
brought
some
lukewarm
beer
the
young
man
had
lowered
his
voice
to
complain
about
the
house
they
were
worthy
people
certainly
people
with
good
ideas
but
the
beer
was
worthless
and
the
soup
abominable
he
would
have
changed
his
lodgings
ten
times
over
only
the
thought
of
the
walk
from
montsou
held
him
back
one
day
or
another
he
would
go
and
live
with
some
family
at
the
settlement
sure
enough
said
maheu
in
his
slow
voice
sure
enough
you
would
be
better
in
a
family
but
shouts
now
broke
out
levaque
had
overthrown
all
the
skittles
at
one
stroke
mouque
and
bonnemort
with
their
faces
towards
the
ground
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
preserved
a
silence
of
profound
approbation
and
the
joy
at
this
stroke
found
vent
in
jokes
especially
when
the
players
perceived
mouquette
radiant
face
behind
the
hedge
she
had
been
prowling
about
there
for
an
hour
and
at
last
ventured
to
come
near
on
hearing
the
laughter
what
are
you
alone
shouted
levaque
where
are
your
sweethearts
my
sweethearts
i
stabled
them
she
replied
with
a
fine
impudent
gaiety
i
looking
for
one
they
all
offered
themselves
throwing
coarse
chaff
at
her
she
refused
with
a
gesture
and
laughed
louder
playing
the
fine
lady
besides
her
father
was
watching
the
game
without
even
taking
his
eyes
from
the
fallen
skittles
ah
levaque
went
on
throwing
a
look
towards
étienne
one
can
tell
where
you
casting
sheep
eyes
my
girl
you
have
to
take
him
by
force
then
étienne
brightened
up
it
was
in
fact
around
him
that
the
putter
was
revolving
and
he
refused
amused
indeed
but
without
having
the
least
desire
for
her
she
remained
planted
behind
the
hedge
for
some
minutes
longer
looking
at
him
with
large
fixed
eyes
then
she
slowly
went
away
and
her
face
suddenly
became
serious
as
if
she
were
overcome
by
the
powerful
sun
in
a
low
voice
étienne
was
again
giving
long
explanations
to
maheu
regarding
the
necessity
for
the
montsou
miners
to
establish
a
provident
fund
since
the
company
professes
to
leave
us
free
he
repeated
what
is
there
to
fear
we
only
have
their
pensions
and
they
distribute
them
according
to
their
own
idea
since
they
do
hold
back
any
of
our
pay
well
it
will
be
prudent
to
form
outside
their
good
pleasure
an
association
of
mutual
help
on
which
we
can
count
at
least
in
cases
of
immediate
need
and
he
gave
details
and
discussed
the
organization
promising
to
undertake
the
labour
of
it
i
am
willing
enough
said
maheu
at
last
convinced
but
there
are
the
others
get
them
to
make
up
their
minds
levaque
had
won
and
they
left
the
skittles
to
empty
their
glasses
but
maheu
refused
to
drink
a
second
glass
he
would
see
later
on
the
day
was
not
yet
done
he
was
thinking
about
pierron
where
could
he
be
no
doubt
at
the
lenfant
estaminet
and
having
persuaded
étienne
and
levaque
the
three
set
out
for
montsou
at
the
same
moment
that
a
new
band
took
possession
of
the
skittles
at
the
avantage
on
the
road
they
had
to
pause
at
the
casimir
bar
and
then
at
the
estaminet
du
progrés
comrades
called
them
through
the
open
doors
and
there
was
no
way
of
refusing
each
time
it
was
a
glass
two
if
they
were
polite
enough
to
return
the
invitation
they
remained
there
ten
minutes
exchanging
a
few
words
and
then
began
again
a
little
farther
on
knowing
the
beer
with
which
they
could
fill
themselves
without
any
other
discomfort
than
having
to
piss
it
out
again
in
the
same
measure
as
clear
as
rock
water
at
the
estaminet
lenfant
they
came
right
upon
pierron
who
was
finishing
his
second
glass
and
who
in
order
not
to
refuse
to
touch
glasses
swallowed
a
third
they
naturally
drank
theirs
also
now
there
were
four
of
them
and
they
set
out
to
see
if
zacharie
was
not
at
the
estaminet
tison
it
was
empty
and
they
called
for
a
glass
in
order
to
wait
for
him
a
moment
then
they
thought
of
the
estaminet
and
accepted
there
a
round
from
captain
richomme
then
they
rambled
from
bar
to
bar
without
any
pretext
simply
saying
that
they
were
having
a
stroll
we
must
go
to
the
volcan
suddenly
said
levaque
who
was
getting
excited
the
others
began
to
laugh
and
hesitated
then
they
accompanied
their
comrade
in
the
midst
of
the
growing
crowd
in
the
long
narrow
room
of
the
volcan
on
a
platform
raised
at
the
end
five
singers
the
scum
of
the
lille
prostitutes
were
walking
about
and
with
monstrous
gestures
and
the
customers
gave
ten
sous
when
they
desired
to
have
one
behind
the
stage
there
was
especially
a
number
of
putters
and
landers
even
trammers
of
fourteen
all
the
youth
of
the
pit
drinking
more
gin
than
beer
a
few
old
miners
also
ventured
there
and
the
worst
husbands
of
the
settlements
those
whose
households
were
falling
into
ruin
as
soon
as
the
band
was
seated
round
a
little
table
étienne
took
possession
of
levaque
to
explain
to
him
his
idea
of
the
provident
fund
like
all
new
converts
who
have
found
a
mission
he
had
become
an
obstinate
propagandist
every
member
he
repeated
could
easily
pay
in
twenty
sous
a
month
as
these
twenty
sous
accumulated
they
would
form
a
nice
little
sum
in
four
or
five
years
and
when
one
has
money
one
is
ready
eh
for
anything
that
turns
up
eh
what
do
you
say
to
it
i
nothing
to
say
against
it
replied
levaque
with
an
abstracted
air
we
will
talk
about
it
he
was
excited
by
an
enormous
blonde
and
determined
to
remain
behind
when
maheu
and
pierron
after
drinking
their
glasses
set
out
without
waiting
for
a
second
song
outside
étienne
who
had
gone
with
them
found
mouquette
who
seemed
to
be
following
them
she
was
always
there
looking
at
him
with
her
large
fixed
eyes
laughing
her
laugh
as
if
to
say
are
you
willing
the
young
man
joked
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
with
a
gesture
of
anger
she
was
lost
in
the
crowd
where
then
is
chaval
asked
pierron
true
said
maheu
he
must
surely
be
at
piquette
let
us
go
to
piquette
but
as
they
all
three
arrived
at
the
estaminet
piquette
sounds
of
a
quarrel
arrested
them
at
the
door
zacharie
with
his
fist
was
threatening
a
phlegmatic
walloon
while
chaval
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
was
looking
on
hullo
there
chaval
said
maheu
quietly
he
is
with
catherine
for
five
long
hours
the
putter
and
her
lover
had
been
walking
about
the
fair
all
along
the
montsou
road
that
wide
road
with
low
bedaubed
houses
winding
downhill
a
crowd
of
people
wandered
up
and
down
in
the
sun
like
a
trail
of
ants
lost
in
the
flat
bare
plain
the
eternal
black
mud
had
dried
a
black
dust
was
rising
and
floating
about
like
a
on
both
sides
the
were
crowded
there
were
rows
of
tables
to
the
street
where
stood
a
double
rank
of
hucksters
at
stalls
in
the
open
air
selling
and
for
the
girls
knives
and
caps
for
the
lads
to
say
nothing
of
sweetmeats
and
biscuits
in
front
of
the
church
archery
was
going
on
opposite
the
yards
they
were
playing
at
bowls
at
the
corner
of
the
joiselle
road
beside
the
administration
buildings
in
a
spot
enclosed
by
fences
crowds
were
watching
a
two
large
red
cocks
armed
with
steel
spurs
their
breasts
torn
and
bleeding
farther
on
at
maigrat
aprons
and
trousers
were
being
won
at
billiards
and
there
were
long
silences
the
crowd
drank
and
stuffed
itself
without
a
sound
a
mute
indigestion
of
beer
and
fried
potatoes
was
expanding
in
the
great
heat
still
further
increased
by
the
bubbling
in
the
open
air
chaval
bought
a
for
nineteen
sous
and
a
handkerchief
for
three
francs
to
give
to
catherine
at
every
turn
they
met
mouque
and
bonnemort
who
had
come
to
the
fair
and
in
meditative
mood
were
plodding
heavily
through
it
side
by
side
another
meeting
made
them
angry
they
caught
sight
of
jeanlin
inciting
bébert
and
lydie
to
steal
bottles
of
gin
from
an
extemporized
bar
installed
at
the
edge
of
an
open
piece
of
ground
catherine
succeeded
in
boxing
her
brother
ears
the
little
girl
had
already
run
away
with
a
bottle
these
imps
of
satan
would
certainly
end
in
a
prison
then
as
they
arrived
before
another
bar
the
it
occurred
to
chaval
to
take
his
sweetheart
in
to
a
competition
of
chaffinches
which
had
been
announced
on
the
door
for
the
past
week
fifteen
from
the
marchiennes
nail
works
had
responded
to
the
appeal
each
with
a
dozen
cages
and
the
gloomy
little
cages
in
which
the
blinded
finches
sat
motionless
were
already
hung
upon
a
paling
in
the
inn
yard
it
was
a
question
as
to
which
in
the
course
of
an
hour
should
repeat
the
phrase
of
its
song
the
greatest
number
of
times
each
with
a
slate
stood
near
his
cages
to
mark
watching
his
neighbours
and
watched
by
them
and
the
chaffinches
had
begun
the
with
the
deeper
note
the
with
their
shriller
note
all
at
first
timid
and
only
risking
a
rare
phrase
then
excited
by
each
songs
increasing
the
pace
then
at
last
carried
away
by
such
a
rage
of
rivalry
that
they
would
even
fall
dead
the
violently
whipped
them
on
with
their
voices
shouting
out
to
them
in
walloon
to
sing
more
still
more
yet
a
little
more
while
the
spectators
about
a
hundred
people
stood
by
in
mute
fascination
in
the
midst
of
this
infernal
music
of
a
hundred
and
eighty
chaffinches
all
repeating
the
same
cadence
out
of
time
it
was
a
which
gained
the
first
prize
a
metal
catherine
and
chaval
were
there
when
zacharie
and
philoméne
entered
they
shook
hands
and
all
stayed
together
but
suddenly
zacharie
became
angry
for
he
discovered
that
a
who
had
come
in
with
his
mates
out
of
curiosity
was
pinching
his
sister
thigh
she
blushed
and
tried
to
make
him
be
silent
trembling
at
the
idea
that
all
these
would
throw
themselves
on
chaval
and
kill
him
if
he
objected
to
her
being
pinched
she
had
felt
the
pinch
but
said
nothing
out
of
prudence
her
lover
however
merely
made
a
grimace
and
as
they
all
four
now
went
out
the
affair
seemed
to
be
finished
but
hardly
had
they
entered
piquette
to
drink
a
glass
when
the
reappeared
making
fun
of
them
and
coming
close
up
to
them
with
an
air
of
provocation
zacharie
insulted
in
his
good
family
feelings
threw
himself
on
the
insolent
intruder
that
my
sister
you
swine
just
wait
a
bit
and
i
damned
if
i
do
make
you
respect
her
the
two
men
were
separated
while
chaval
who
was
quite
calm
only
repeated
let
be
it
my
concern
i
tell
you
i
do
care
a
damn
for
him
maheu
now
arrived
with
his
party
and
quieted
catherine
and
philoméne
who
were
in
tears
the
had
disappeared
and
there
was
laughter
in
the
crowd
to
bring
the
episode
to
an
end
chaval
who
was
at
home
at
the
estaminet
piquette
called
for
drinks
étienne
had
touched
glasses
with
catherine
and
all
drank
together
the
father
the
daughter
and
her
lover
the
son
and
his
mistress
saying
politely
to
your
good
health
pierron
afterwards
persisted
in
paying
for
more
drinks
and
they
were
all
in
good
humour
when
zacharie
grew
wild
again
at
the
sight
of
his
comrade
mouquet
and
called
him
as
he
said
to
go
and
finish
his
affair
with
the
i
shall
have
to
go
and
do
for
him
here
chaval
keep
philoméne
with
catherine
i
coming
back
maheu
offered
drinks
in
his
turn
after
all
if
the
lad
wished
to
avenge
his
sister
it
was
not
a
bad
example
but
as
soon
as
she
had
seen
mouquet
philoméne
felt
at
rest
and
nodded
her
head
sure
enough
the
two
chaps
would
be
off
to
the
volcan
on
the
evenings
of
the
fair
was
terminated
in
the
of
the
it
was
a
widow
madame
désir
who
kept
this
a
fat
matron
of
fifty
as
round
as
a
tub
but
so
fresh
that
she
still
had
six
lovers
one
for
every
day
of
the
week
she
said
and
the
six
together
for
sunday
she
called
all
the
miners
her
children
and
grew
tender
at
the
thought
of
the
flood
of
beer
which
she
had
poured
out
for
them
during
the
last
thirty
years
and
she
boasted
also
that
a
putter
never
became
pregnant
without
having
first
stretched
her
legs
at
her
establishment
there
were
two
rooms
in
the
the
bar
which
contained
the
counter
and
tables
then
communicating
with
it
on
the
same
floor
by
a
large
arch
was
the
a
large
hall
only
planked
in
the
middle
being
paved
with
bricks
round
the
sides
it
was
decorated
with
two
garlands
of
paper
flowers
which
crossed
one
another
and
were
united
in
the
middle
by
a
crown
of
the
same
flowers
while
along
the
walls
were
rows
of
gilt
shields
bearing
the
names
of
saints
éloi
patron
of
the
crispin
patron
of
the
shoemakers
barbara
patron
of
the
miners
the
whole
calendar
of
corporations
the
ceiling
was
so
low
that
the
three
musicians
on
their
platform
which
was
about
the
size
of
a
pulpit
knocked
their
heads
against
it
when
it
became
dark
four
petroleum
lamps
were
fastened
to
the
four
corners
of
the
room
on
this
sunday
there
was
dancing
from
five
with
the
full
daylight
through
the
windows
but
it
was
not
until
towards
seven
that
the
rooms
began
to
fill
outside
a
gale
was
rising
blowing
great
black
showers
of
dust
which
blinded
people
and
sleeted
into
the
maheu
étienne
and
pierron
having
come
in
to
sit
down
had
found
chaval
at
the
dancing
with
catherine
while
philoméne
by
herself
was
looking
on
neither
levaque
nor
zacharie
had
reappeared
as
there
were
no
benches
around
the
catherine
came
after
each
dance
to
rest
at
her
father
table
they
called
philoméne
but
she
preferred
to
stand
up
the
twilight
was
coming
on
the
three
musicians
played
furiously
one
could
only
see
in
the
hall
the
movement
of
hips
and
breasts
in
the
midst
of
a
confusion
of
arms
the
appearance
of
the
four
lamps
was
greeted
noisily
and
suddenly
everything
was
lit
up
the
red
faces
the
dishevelled
hair
sticking
to
the
skin
the
flying
skirts
spreading
abroad
the
strong
odour
of
perspiring
couples
maheu
pointed
out
mouquette
to
étienne
she
was
as
round
and
greasy
as
a
bladder
of
lard
revolving
violently
in
the
arms
of
a
tall
lean
lander
she
had
been
obliged
to
console
herself
and
take
a
man
at
last
at
eight
maheude
appeared
with
estelle
at
her
breast
followed
by
alzire
henri
and
lénore
she
had
come
there
straight
to
her
husband
without
fear
of
missing
him
they
could
sup
later
on
as
yet
nobody
was
hungry
with
their
stomachs
soaked
in
coffee
and
thickened
with
beer
other
women
came
in
and
they
whispered
together
when
they
saw
behind
maheude
the
levaque
woman
enter
with
bouteloup
who
led
in
by
the
hand
achille
and
désirée
philoméne
little
ones
the
two
neighbours
seemed
to
be
getting
on
well
together
one
turning
round
to
chat
with
the
other
on
the
way
there
had
been
a
great
explanation
and
maheude
had
resigned
herself
to
zacharie
marriage
in
despair
at
the
loss
of
her
eldest
son
wages
but
overcome
by
the
thought
that
she
could
not
hold
it
back
any
longer
without
injustice
she
was
trying
therefore
to
put
a
good
face
on
it
though
with
an
anxious
heart
as
a
housekeeper
who
was
asking
herself
how
she
could
make
both
ends
meet
now
that
the
best
part
of
her
purse
was
going
place
yourself
there
neighbour
she
said
pointing
to
a
table
near
that
where
maheu
was
drinking
with
étienne
and
pierron
is
not
my
husband
with
you
asked
the
levaque
woman
the
others
told
her
that
he
would
soon
come
they
were
all
seated
together
in
a
heap
bouteloup
and
the
youngsters
so
tightly
squeezed
among
the
drinkers
that
the
two
tables
only
formed
one
there
was
a
call
for
drinks
seeing
her
mother
and
her
children
philoméne
had
decided
to
come
near
she
accepted
a
chair
and
seemed
pleased
to
hear
that
she
was
at
last
to
be
married
then
as
they
were
looking
for
zacharie
she
replied
in
her
soft
voice
i
am
waiting
for
him
he
is
over
there
maheu
had
exchanged
a
look
with
his
wife
she
had
then
consented
he
became
serious
and
smoked
in
silence
he
also
felt
anxiety
for
the
morrow
in
face
of
the
ingratitude
of
these
children
who
got
married
one
by
one
leaving
their
parents
in
wretchedness
the
dancing
still
went
on
and
the
end
of
a
quadrille
drowned
the
in
red
dust
the
walls
cracked
a
cornet
produced
shrill
whistling
sounds
like
a
locomotive
in
distress
and
when
the
dancers
stopped
they
were
smoking
like
horses
do
you
remember
said
the
levaque
woman
bending
towards
ear
you
talked
of
strangling
catherine
if
she
did
anything
foolish
chaval
brought
catherine
back
to
the
family
table
and
both
of
them
standing
behind
the
father
finished
their
glasses
bah
murmured
maheude
with
an
air
of
resignation
one
says
things
like
that
but
what
quiets
me
is
that
she
will
not
have
a
child
i
feel
sure
of
that
you
see
if
she
is
confined
and
obliged
to
marry
what
shall
we
do
for
a
living
then
now
the
cornet
was
whistling
a
polka
and
as
the
deafening
noise
began
again
maheu
in
a
low
voice
communicated
an
idea
to
his
wife
why
should
they
not
take
a
lodger
étienne
for
example
who
was
looking
out
for
quarters
they
would
have
room
since
zacharie
was
going
to
leave
them
and
the
money
that
they
would
lose
in
that
direction
would
be
in
part
regained
in
the
other
maheude
face
brightened
certainly
it
was
a
good
idea
it
must
be
arranged
she
seemed
to
be
saved
from
starvation
once
more
and
her
good
humour
returned
so
quickly
that
she
ordered
a
new
round
of
drinks
étienne
meanwhile
was
seeking
to
indoctrinate
pierron
to
whom
he
was
explaining
his
plan
of
a
provident
fund
he
had
made
him
promise
to
subscribe
when
he
was
imprudent
enough
to
reveal
his
real
aim
and
if
we
go
out
on
strike
you
can
see
how
useful
that
fund
will
be
we
can
snap
our
fingers
at
the
company
we
shall
have
there
a
fund
to
fight
against
them
eh
do
you
think
so
pierron
lowered
his
eyes
and
grew
pale
he
stammered
i
think
over
it
good
conduct
that
the
best
provident
fund
then
maheu
took
possession
of
étienne
and
squarely
like
a
good
man
proposed
to
take
him
as
a
lodger
the
young
man
accepted
at
once
anxious
to
live
in
the
settlement
with
the
idea
of
being
nearer
to
his
mates
the
matter
was
settled
in
three
words
maheude
declaring
that
they
would
wait
for
the
marriage
of
the
children
just
then
zacharie
at
last
came
back
with
mouquet
and
levaque
the
three
brought
in
the
odours
of
the
volcan
a
breath
of
gin
a
musky
acidity
of
girls
they
were
very
tipsy
and
seemed
well
pleased
with
themselves
digging
their
elbows
into
each
other
and
grinning
when
he
knew
that
he
was
at
last
to
be
married
zacharie
began
to
laugh
so
loudly
that
he
choked
philoméne
peacefully
declared
that
she
would
rather
see
him
laugh
than
cry
as
there
were
no
more
chairs
bouteloup
had
moved
so
as
to
give
up
half
of
his
to
levaque
and
the
latter
suddenly
much
affected
by
realizing
that
the
whole
family
party
was
there
once
more
had
beer
served
out
by
the
lord
we
do
amuse
ourselves
so
often
he
roared
they
remained
there
till
ten
women
continued
to
arrive
either
to
join
or
to
take
away
their
men
bands
of
children
followed
in
rows
and
the
mothers
no
longer
troubled
themselves
pulling
out
their
long
pale
breasts
like
sacks
of
oats
and
smearing
their
chubby
babies
with
milk
while
the
little
ones
who
were
already
able
to
walk
gorged
with
beer
and
on
all
fours
beneath
the
table
relieved
themselves
without
shame
it
was
a
rising
sea
of
beer
from
madame
désir
disembowelled
barrels
the
beer
enlarged
every
belly
flowing
from
noses
eyes
and
everywhere
so
puffed
out
was
the
crowd
that
every
one
had
a
shoulder
or
knee
poking
into
his
neighbour
all
were
cheerful
and
merry
in
thus
feeling
each
other
elbows
a
continuous
laugh
kept
their
mouths
open
from
ear
to
ear
the
heat
was
like
an
oven
they
were
roasting
and
felt
themselves
at
ease
with
glistening
skin
gilded
in
a
thick
smoke
from
the
pipes
the
only
discomfort
was
when
one
had
to
move
away
from
time
to
time
a
girl
rose
went
to
the
other
end
near
the
pump
lifted
her
clothes
and
then
came
back
beneath
the
garlands
of
painted
paper
the
dancers
could
no
longer
see
each
other
they
perspired
so
much
this
encouraged
the
trammers
to
tumble
the
putters
over
catching
them
at
random
by
the
hips
but
where
a
girl
tumbled
with
a
man
over
her
the
cornet
covered
their
fall
with
its
furious
music
the
swirl
of
feet
wrapped
them
round
as
if
the
ball
had
collapsed
upon
them
someone
who
was
passing
warned
pierron
that
his
daughter
lydie
was
sleeping
at
the
door
across
the
pavement
she
had
drunk
her
share
of
the
stolen
bottle
and
was
tipsy
he
had
to
carry
her
away
in
his
arms
while
jeanlin
and
bébert
who
were
more
sober
followed
him
behind
thinking
it
a
great
joke
this
was
the
signal
for
departure
and
several
families
came
out
of
the
the
maheus
and
the
levaques
deciding
to
return
to
the
settlement
at
the
same
moment
father
bonnemort
and
old
mouque
also
left
montsou
walking
in
the
same
somnambulistic
manner
preserving
the
obstinate
silence
of
their
recollections
and
they
all
went
back
together
passing
for
the
last
time
through
the
fair
where
the
were
coagulating
and
by
the
estaminets
from
which
the
last
glasses
were
flowing
in
a
stream
towards
the
middle
of
the
road
the
storm
was
still
threatening
and
sounds
of
laughter
arose
as
they
left
the
lighted
houses
to
lose
themselves
in
the
dark
country
around
panting
breaths
arose
from
the
ripe
wheat
many
children
must
have
been
made
on
that
night
they
arrived
in
confusion
at
the
settlement
neither
the
levaques
nor
the
maheus
supped
with
appetite
and
the
latter
kept
on
dropping
off
to
sleep
while
finishing
their
morning
boiled
beef
étienne
had
led
away
chaval
for
one
more
drink
at
rasseneur
i
am
with
you
said
chaval
when
his
mate
had
explained
the
matter
of
the
provident
fund
put
it
there
you
a
fine
fellow
the
beginning
of
drunkenness
was
flaming
in
étienne
eyes
he
exclaimed
yes
let
join
hands
as
for
me
you
know
i
would
give
up
everything
for
the
sake
of
justice
both
drink
and
girls
there
only
one
thing
that
warms
my
heart
and
that
is
the
thought
that
we
are
going
to
sweep
away
these
bourgeois
chapter
iii
towards
the
middle
of
august
étienne
settled
with
the
maheus
zacharie
having
married
and
obtained
from
the
company
a
vacant
house
in
the
settlement
for
philoméne
and
the
two
children
during
the
first
days
the
young
man
experienced
some
constraint
in
the
presence
of
catherine
there
was
a
constant
intimacy
as
he
everywhere
replaced
the
elder
brother
sharing
jeanlin
bed
over
against
the
big
sister
going
to
bed
and
getting
up
he
had
to
dress
and
undress
near
her
and
see
her
take
off
and
put
on
her
garments
when
the
last
skirt
fell
from
her
she
appeared
of
pallid
whiteness
that
transparent
snow
of
anaemic
blondes
and
he
experienced
a
constant
emotion
in
finding
her
with
hands
and
face
already
spoilt
as
white
as
if
dipped
in
milk
from
her
heels
to
her
neck
where
the
line
of
tan
stood
out
sharply
like
a
necklace
of
amber
he
pretended
to
turn
away
but
little
by
little
he
knew
her
the
feet
at
first
which
his
lowered
eyes
met
then
a
glimpse
of
a
knee
when
she
slid
beneath
the
coverlet
then
her
bosom
with
little
rigid
breasts
as
she
leant
over
the
bowl
in
the
morning
she
would
hasten
without
looking
at
him
and
in
ten
seconds
was
undressed
and
stretched
beside
alzire
with
so
supple
and
a
movement
that
he
had
scarcely
taken
off
his
shoes
when
she
disappeared
turning
her
back
and
only
showing
her
heavy
knot
of
hair
she
never
had
any
reason
to
be
angry
with
him
if
a
sort
of
obsession
made
him
watch
her
in
spite
of
himself
at
the
moment
when
she
lay
down
he
avoided
all
practical
jokes
or
dangerous
pastimes
the
parents
were
there
and
besides
he
still
had
for
her
a
feeling
half
of
friendship
and
half
of
spite
which
prevented
him
from
treating
her
as
a
girl
to
be
desired
in
the
midst
of
the
abandonment
of
their
now
common
life
in
dressing
at
meals
during
work
where
nothing
of
them
remained
secret
not
even
their
most
intimate
needs
all
the
modesty
of
the
family
had
taken
refuge
in
the
daily
bath
for
which
the
young
girl
now
went
upstairs
alone
while
the
men
bathed
below
one
after
the
other
at
the
end
of
the
first
month
étienne
and
catherine
seemed
no
longer
to
see
each
other
when
in
the
evening
before
extinguishing
the
candle
they
moved
about
the
room
undressed
she
had
ceased
to
hasten
and
resumed
her
old
custom
of
doing
up
her
hair
at
the
edge
of
her
bed
while
her
arms
raised
in
the
air
lifted
her
chemise
to
her
thighs
and
he
without
his
trousers
sometimes
helped
her
looking
for
the
hairpins
that
she
had
lost
custom
killed
the
shame
of
being
naked
they
found
it
natural
to
be
like
this
for
they
were
doing
no
harm
and
it
was
not
their
fault
if
there
was
only
one
room
for
so
many
people
sometimes
however
a
trouble
came
over
them
suddenly
at
moments
when
they
had
no
guilty
thought
after
some
nights
when
he
had
not
seen
her
pale
body
he
suddenly
saw
her
white
all
over
with
a
whiteness
which
shook
him
with
a
shiver
which
obliged
him
to
turn
away
for
fear
of
yielding
to
the
desire
to
take
her
on
other
evenings
without
any
apparent
reason
she
would
be
overcome
by
a
panic
of
modesty
and
hasten
to
slip
between
the
sheets
as
if
she
felt
the
hands
of
this
lad
seizing
her
then
when
the
candle
was
out
they
both
knew
that
they
were
not
sleeping
but
were
thinking
of
each
other
in
spite
of
their
weariness
this
made
them
restless
and
sulky
all
the
following
day
they
liked
best
the
tranquil
evenings
when
they
could
behave
together
like
comrades
étienne
only
complained
of
jeanlin
who
slept
curled
up
alzire
slept
lightly
and
lénore
and
henri
were
found
in
the
morning
in
each
other
arms
exactly
as
they
had
gone
to
sleep
in
the
dark
house
there
was
no
other
sound
than
the
snoring
of
maheu
and
maheude
rolling
out
at
regular
intervals
like
a
forge
bellows
on
the
whole
étienne
was
better
off
than
at
rasseneur
the
bed
was
tolerable
and
the
sheets
were
changed
every
month
he
had
better
soup
too
and
only
suffered
from
the
rarity
of
meat
but
they
were
all
in
the
same
condition
and
for
francs
he
could
not
demand
rabbit
to
every
meal
these
francs
helped
the
family
and
enabled
them
to
make
both
ends
meet
though
always
leaving
some
small
debts
and
arrears
so
the
maheus
were
grateful
to
their
lodger
his
linen
was
washed
and
mended
his
buttons
sewn
on
and
his
affairs
kept
in
order
in
fact
he
felt
all
around
him
a
woman
neatness
and
care
it
was
at
this
time
that
étienne
began
to
understand
the
ideas
that
were
buzzing
in
his
brain
up
till
then
he
had
only
felt
an
instinctive
revolt
in
the
midst
of
the
inarticulate
fermentation
among
his
mates
all
sorts
of
confused
questions
came
before
him
why
are
some
miserable
why
are
others
rich
why
are
the
former
beneath
the
heel
of
the
latter
without
hope
of
ever
taking
their
place
and
his
first
stage
was
to
understand
his
ignorance
a
secret
shame
a
hidden
annoyance
gnawed
him
from
that
time
he
knew
nothing
he
dared
not
talk
about
these
things
which
were
working
in
him
like
a
passion
the
equality
of
all
men
and
the
equity
which
demanded
a
fair
division
of
the
earth
wealth
he
thus
took
to
the
methodless
study
of
those
who
in
ignorance
feel
the
fascination
of
knowledge
he
now
kept
up
a
regular
correspondence
with
pluchart
who
was
better
educated
than
himself
and
more
advanced
in
the
socialist
movement
he
had
books
sent
to
him
and
his
reading
still
further
excited
his
brain
especially
a
medical
book
entitled
du
in
which
a
belgian
doctor
had
summed
up
the
evils
of
which
the
people
in
coal
mines
were
dying
without
counting
treatises
on
political
economy
incomprehensible
in
their
technical
dryness
anarchist
pamphlets
which
upset
his
ideas
and
old
numbers
of
newspapers
which
he
preserved
as
irrefutable
arguments
for
possible
discussions
souvarine
also
lent
him
books
and
the
work
on
societies
had
made
him
dream
for
a
month
of
a
universal
exchange
association
abolishing
money
and
basing
the
whole
social
life
on
work
the
shame
of
his
ignorance
left
him
and
a
certain
pride
came
to
him
now
that
he
felt
himself
thinking
during
these
first
months
étienne
retained
the
ecstasy
of
a
novice
his
heart
was
bursting
with
generous
indignation
against
the
oppressors
and
looking
forward
to
the
approaching
triumph
of
the
oppressed
he
had
not
yet
manufactured
a
system
his
reading
had
been
too
vague
rasseneur
practical
demands
were
mixed
up
in
his
mind
with
souvarine
violent
and
destructive
methods
and
when
he
came
out
of
the
avantage
where
he
was
to
be
found
nearly
every
day
railing
with
them
against
the
company
he
walked
as
if
in
a
dream
assisting
at
a
radical
regeneration
of
nations
to
be
effected
without
one
broken
window
or
a
single
drop
of
blood
the
methods
of
execution
remained
obscure
he
preferred
to
think
that
things
would
go
very
well
for
he
lost
his
head
as
soon
as
he
tried
to
formulate
a
programme
of
reconstruction
he
even
showed
himself
full
of
illogical
moderation
he
often
said
that
we
must
banish
politics
from
the
social
question
a
phrase
which
he
had
read
and
which
seemed
a
useful
one
to
repeat
among
the
phlegmatic
colliers
with
whom
he
lived
every
evening
now
at
the
maheus
they
delayed
half
an
hour
before
going
up
to
bed
étienne
always
introduced
the
same
subject
as
his
nature
became
more
refined
he
found
himself
wounded
by
the
promiscuity
of
the
settlement
were
they
beasts
to
be
thus
penned
together
in
the
midst
of
the
fields
so
tightly
packed
that
one
could
not
change
shirt
without
exhibiting
one
backside
to
the
neighbours
and
how
bad
it
was
for
health
and
boys
and
girls
were
forced
to
grow
corrupt
together
lord
replied
maheu
if
there
were
more
money
there
would
be
more
comfort
all
the
same
it
true
enough
that
it
good
for
no
one
to
live
piled
up
like
that
it
always
ends
with
making
the
men
drunk
and
the
girls
and
the
family
began
to
talk
each
having
his
say
while
the
petroleum
lamp
vitiated
the
air
of
the
room
already
stinking
of
fried
onion
no
life
was
certainly
not
a
joke
one
had
to
work
like
a
brute
at
labour
which
was
once
a
punishment
for
convicts
one
left
one
skin
there
oftener
than
was
one
turn
all
that
without
even
getting
meat
on
the
table
in
the
evening
no
doubt
one
had
one
feed
one
ate
indeed
but
so
little
just
enough
to
suffer
without
dying
overcome
with
debts
and
pursued
as
if
one
had
stolen
the
bread
when
sunday
came
one
slept
from
weariness
the
only
pleasures
were
to
get
drunk
and
to
get
a
child
with
one
wife
then
the
beer
swelled
the
belly
and
the
child
later
on
left
you
to
go
to
the
dogs
no
it
was
certainly
not
a
joke
then
maheude
joined
in
the
bother
is
you
see
when
you
have
to
say
to
yourself
that
it
change
when
you
young
you
think
that
happiness
will
come
some
time
you
hope
for
things
and
then
the
wretchedness
begins
always
over
again
and
you
get
shut
up
in
it
now
i
do
wish
harm
to
any
one
but
there
are
times
when
this
injustice
makes
me
mad
there
was
silence
they
were
all
breathing
with
the
vague
discomfort
of
this
horizon
father
bonnemort
only
if
he
was
there
opened
his
eyes
with
surprise
for
in
his
time
people
used
not
to
worry
about
things
they
were
born
in
the
coal
and
they
hammered
at
the
seam
without
asking
for
more
while
now
there
was
an
air
stirring
which
made
the
colliers
ambitious
it
do
do
to
spit
at
anything
he
murmured
a
good
glass
is
a
good
glass
as
to
the
masters
they
often
rascals
but
there
always
will
be
masters
wo
there
what
the
use
of
racking
your
brains
over
those
things
étienne
at
once
became
animated
what
the
worker
was
to
be
forbidden
to
think
why
that
was
just
it
things
would
change
now
because
the
worker
had
begun
to
think
in
the
old
man
time
the
miner
lived
in
the
mine
like
a
brute
like
a
machine
for
extracting
coal
always
under
the
earth
with
ears
and
eyes
stopped
to
outward
events
so
the
rich
who
governed
found
it
easy
to
sell
him
and
buy
him
and
to
devour
his
flesh
he
did
not
even
know
what
was
going
on
but
now
the
miner
was
waking
up
down
there
germinating
in
the
earth
just
as
a
grain
germinates
and
some
fine
day
he
would
spring
up
in
the
midst
of
the
fields
yes
men
would
spring
up
an
army
of
men
who
would
justice
is
it
not
true
that
all
citizens
are
equal
since
the
revolution
because
they
vote
together
why
should
the
worker
remain
the
slave
of
the
master
who
pays
him
the
big
companies
with
their
machines
were
crushing
everything
and
one
no
longer
had
against
them
the
ancient
guarantees
when
people
of
the
same
trade
united
in
a
body
were
able
to
defend
themselves
it
was
for
that
by
god
and
for
no
other
reason
that
all
would
burst
up
one
day
thanks
to
education
one
had
only
to
look
into
the
settlement
itself
the
grandfathers
could
not
sign
their
names
the
fathers
could
do
so
and
as
for
the
sons
they
read
and
wrote
like
schoolmasters
ah
it
was
springing
up
it
was
springing
up
little
by
little
a
rough
harvest
of
men
who
would
ripen
in
the
sun
from
the
moment
when
they
were
no
longer
each
of
them
stuck
to
his
place
for
his
whole
existence
and
when
they
had
the
ambition
to
take
a
neighbour
place
why
should
they
not
hit
out
with
their
fists
and
try
for
the
mastery
maheu
was
shaken
but
remained
full
of
doubts
as
soon
as
you
move
they
give
you
back
your
certificate
he
said
the
old
man
is
right
it
will
always
be
the
miner
who
gets
all
the
trouble
without
a
chance
of
a
leg
of
mutton
now
and
then
as
a
reward
maheude
who
had
been
silent
for
a
while
awoke
as
from
a
dream
but
if
what
the
priests
tell
is
true
if
the
poor
people
in
this
world
become
the
rich
ones
in
the
next
a
burst
of
laughter
interrupted
her
even
the
children
shrugged
their
shoulders
being
incredulous
in
the
open
air
keeping
a
secret
fear
of
ghosts
in
the
pit
but
glad
of
the
empty
sky
ah
bosh
the
priests
exclaimed
maheu
if
they
believed
that
they
eat
less
and
work
more
so
as
to
reserve
a
better
place
for
themselves
up
there
no
when
one
dead
one
dead
maheude
sighed
deeply
oh
lord
lord
then
her
hands
fell
on
to
her
knees
with
a
gesture
of
immense
dejection
then
if
that
true
we
are
done
for
we
are
they
all
looked
at
one
another
father
bonnemort
spat
into
his
handkerchief
while
maheu
sat
with
his
extinguished
pipe
which
he
had
forgotten
in
his
mouth
alzire
listened
between
lénore
and
henri
who
were
sleeping
on
the
edge
of
the
table
but
catherine
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
never
took
her
large
clear
eyes
off
étienne
while
he
was
protesting
declaring
his
faith
and
opening
out
the
enchanting
future
of
his
social
dream
around
them
the
settlement
was
asleep
one
only
heard
the
stray
cries
of
a
child
or
the
complaints
of
a
belated
drunkard
in
the
parlour
the
clock
ticked
slowly
and
a
damp
freshness
arose
from
the
sanded
floor
in
spite
of
the
stuffy
air
fine
ideas
said
the
young
man
why
do
you
need
a
good
god
and
his
paradise
to
make
you
happy
have
you
got
it
in
your
own
power
to
make
yourselves
happy
on
earth
with
his
enthusiastic
voice
he
spoke
on
and
on
the
closed
horizon
was
bursting
out
a
gap
of
light
was
opening
in
the
sombre
lives
of
these
poor
people
the
eternal
wretchedness
beginning
over
and
over
again
the
brutalizing
labour
the
fate
of
a
beast
who
gives
his
wool
and
has
his
throat
cut
all
the
misfortune
disappeared
as
though
swept
away
by
a
great
flood
of
sunlight
and
beneath
the
dazzling
gleam
of
fairyland
justice
descended
from
heaven
since
the
good
god
was
dead
justice
would
assure
the
happiness
of
men
and
equality
and
brotherhood
would
reign
a
new
society
would
spring
up
in
a
day
just
as
in
dreams
an
immense
town
with
the
splendour
of
a
mirage
in
which
each
citizen
lived
by
his
work
and
took
his
share
in
the
common
joys
the
old
rotten
world
had
fallen
to
dust
a
young
humanity
purged
from
its
crimes
formed
but
a
single
nation
of
workers
having
for
their
motto
to
each
according
to
his
deserts
and
to
each
desert
according
to
its
performance
and
this
dream
grew
continually
larger
and
more
beautiful
and
more
seductive
as
it
mounted
higher
in
the
impossible
at
first
maheude
refused
to
listen
possessed
by
a
deep
dread
no
no
it
was
too
beautiful
it
would
not
do
to
embark
upon
these
ideas
for
they
made
life
seem
abominable
afterwards
and
one
would
have
destroyed
everything
in
the
effort
to
be
happy
when
she
saw
maheu
eyes
shine
and
that
he
was
troubled
and
won
over
she
became
restless
and
exclaimed
interrupting
étienne
do
listen
my
man
you
can
see
he
only
telling
us
do
you
think
the
bourgeois
would
ever
consent
to
work
as
we
do
but
little
by
little
the
charm
worked
on
her
also
her
imagination
was
aroused
and
she
smiled
at
last
entering
his
marvellous
world
of
hope
it
was
so
sweet
to
forget
for
a
while
the
sad
reality
when
one
lives
like
the
beasts
with
face
bent
towards
the
earth
one
needs
a
corner
of
falsehood
where
one
can
amuse
oneself
by
regaling
on
the
things
one
will
never
possess
and
what
made
her
enthusiastic
and
brought
her
into
agreement
with
the
young
man
was
the
idea
of
justice
now
there
you
right
she
exclaimed
when
a
thing
just
i
mind
being
cut
to
pieces
for
it
and
it
true
enough
it
would
be
just
for
us
to
have
a
turn
then
maheu
ventured
to
become
excited
blast
it
all
i
am
not
rich
but
i
would
give
five
francs
to
keep
alive
to
see
that
what
a
hustling
eh
will
it
be
soon
and
how
can
we
set
about
it
étienne
began
talking
again
the
old
social
system
was
cracking
it
could
not
last
more
than
a
few
months
he
affirmed
roundly
as
to
the
methods
of
execution
he
spoke
more
vaguely
mixing
up
his
reading
and
fearing
before
ignorant
hearers
to
enter
on
explanations
where
he
might
lose
himself
all
the
systems
had
their
share
in
it
softened
by
the
certainty
of
easy
triumph
a
universal
kiss
which
would
bring
to
an
end
all
class
misunderstandings
without
taking
count
however
of
the
among
the
masters
and
bourgeois
whom
it
would
perhaps
be
necessary
to
bring
to
reason
by
force
and
the
maheus
looked
as
if
they
understood
approving
and
accepting
miraculous
solutions
with
the
blind
faith
of
new
believers
like
those
christians
of
the
early
days
of
the
church
who
awaited
the
coming
of
a
perfect
society
on
the
dunghill
of
the
ancient
world
little
alzire
picked
up
a
few
words
and
imagined
happiness
under
the
form
of
a
very
warm
house
where
children
could
play
and
eat
as
long
as
they
liked
catherine
without
moving
her
chin
always
resting
in
her
hand
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
étienne
and
when
he
stopped
a
slight
shudder
passed
over
her
and
she
was
quite
pale
as
if
she
felt
the
cold
but
maheude
looked
at
the
clock
past
nine
can
it
be
possible
we
shall
never
get
up
and
the
maheus
left
the
table
with
hearts
ill
at
ease
and
in
despair
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
had
just
been
rich
and
that
they
had
now
suddenly
fallen
back
into
the
mud
father
bonnemort
who
was
setting
out
for
the
pit
growled
that
those
sort
of
stories
would
make
the
soup
better
while
the
others
went
upstairs
in
single
file
noticing
the
dampness
of
the
walls
and
the
pestiferous
stuffiness
of
the
air
upstairs
amid
the
heavy
slumber
of
the
settlement
when
catherine
had
got
into
bed
last
and
blown
out
the
candle
étienne
heard
her
tossing
feverishly
before
getting
to
sleep
often
at
these
conversations
the
neighbours
came
in
levaque
who
grew
excited
at
the
idea
of
a
general
sharing
pierron
who
prudently
went
to
bed
as
soon
as
they
attacked
the
company
at
long
intervals
zacharie
came
in
for
a
moment
but
politics
bored
him
he
preferred
to
go
off
and
drink
a
glass
at
the
avantage
as
to
chaval
he
would
go
to
extremes
and
wanted
to
draw
blood
nearly
every
evening
he
passed
an
hour
with
the
maheus
in
this
assiduity
there
was
a
certain
unconfessed
jealousy
the
fear
that
he
would
be
robbed
of
catherine
this
girl
of
whom
he
was
already
growing
tired
had
become
precious
to
him
now
that
a
man
slept
near
her
and
could
take
her
at
night
étienne
influence
increased
he
gradually
revolutionized
the
settlement
his
propaganda
was
unseen
and
all
the
more
sure
since
he
was
growing
in
the
estimation
of
all
maheude
notwithstanding
the
caution
of
a
prudent
housekeeper
treated
him
with
consideration
as
a
young
man
who
paid
regularly
and
neither
drank
nor
gambled
with
his
nose
always
in
a
book
she
spread
abroad
his
reputation
among
the
neighbours
as
an
educated
lad
a
reputation
which
they
abused
by
asking
him
to
write
their
letters
he
was
a
sort
of
business
man
charged
with
correspondence
and
consulted
by
households
in
affairs
of
difficulty
since
september
he
had
thus
at
last
been
able
to
establish
his
famous
provident
fund
which
was
still
very
precarious
only
including
the
inhabitants
of
the
settlement
but
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
obtain
the
adhesion
of
the
miners
at
all
the
pits
especially
if
the
company
which
had
remained
passive
continued
not
to
interfere
he
had
been
made
secretary
of
the
association
and
he
even
received
a
small
salary
for
the
clerking
this
made
him
almost
rich
if
a
married
miner
can
with
difficulty
make
both
ends
meet
a
sober
lad
who
has
no
burdens
can
even
manage
to
save
from
this
time
a
slow
transformation
took
place
in
étienne
certain
instincts
of
refinement
and
comfort
which
had
slept
during
his
poverty
were
now
revealed
he
began
to
buy
cloth
garments
he
also
bought
a
pair
of
elegant
boots
he
became
a
big
man
the
whole
settlement
grouped
round
him
the
satisfaction
of
his
was
delicious
he
became
intoxicated
with
this
first
enjoyment
of
popularity
to
be
at
the
head
of
others
to
command
he
who
was
so
young
and
but
the
day
before
had
been
a
mere
labourer
this
filled
him
with
pride
and
enlarged
his
dream
of
an
approaching
revolution
in
which
he
was
to
play
a
part
his
face
changed
he
became
serious
and
put
on
airs
while
his
growing
ambition
inflamed
his
theories
and
pushed
him
to
ideas
of
violence
but
autumn
was
advancing
and
the
october
cold
had
blighted
the
little
gardens
of
the
settlement
behind
the
thin
lilacs
the
trammers
no
longer
tumbled
the
putters
over
on
the
shed
and
only
the
winter
vegetables
remained
the
cabbages
pearled
with
white
frost
the
leeks
and
the
salads
once
more
the
rains
were
beating
down
on
the
red
tiles
and
flowing
down
into
the
tubs
beneath
the
gutters
with
the
sound
of
a
torrent
in
every
house
the
stove
piled
up
with
coal
was
never
cold
and
poisoned
the
close
parlours
it
was
the
season
of
wretchedness
beginning
once
more
in
october
on
one
of
the
first
frosty
nights
étienne
feverish
after
his
conversation
below
could
not
sleep
he
had
seen
catherine
glide
beneath
the
coverlet
and
then
blow
out
the
candle
she
also
appeared
to
be
quite
overcome
and
tormented
by
one
of
those
fits
of
modesty
which
still
made
her
hasten
sometimes
and
so
awkwardly
that
she
only
uncovered
herself
more
in
the
darkness
she
lay
as
though
dead
but
he
knew
that
she
also
was
awake
and
he
felt
that
she
was
thinking
of
him
just
as
he
was
thinking
of
her
this
mute
exchange
of
their
beings
had
never
before
filled
them
with
such
trouble
the
minutes
went
by
and
neither
he
nor
she
moved
only
their
breathing
was
embarrassed
in
spite
of
their
efforts
to
retain
it
twice
over
he
was
on
the
point
of
rising
and
taking
her
it
was
idiotic
to
have
such
a
strong
desire
for
each
other
and
never
to
satisfy
it
why
should
they
thus
sulk
against
what
they
desired
the
children
were
asleep
she
was
quite
willing
he
was
certain
that
she
was
waiting
for
him
stifling
and
that
she
would
close
her
arms
round
him
in
silence
with
clenched
teeth
nearly
an
hour
passed
he
did
not
go
to
take
her
and
she
did
not
turn
round
for
fear
of
calling
him
the
more
they
lived
side
by
side
the
more
a
barrier
was
raised
of
shames
repugnancies
delicacies
of
friendship
which
they
could
not
explain
even
to
themselves
chapter
iv
listen
said
maheude
to
her
man
when
you
go
to
montsou
for
the
pay
just
bring
me
back
a
pound
of
coffee
and
a
kilo
of
sugar
he
was
sewing
one
of
his
shoes
in
order
to
spare
the
cobbling
good
he
murmured
without
leaving
his
task
i
should
like
you
to
go
to
the
butcher
too
a
bit
of
veal
eh
so
long
since
we
saw
it
this
time
he
raised
his
head
do
you
think
then
that
i
got
thousands
coming
in
the
pay
is
too
little
as
it
is
with
their
confounded
idea
of
always
stopping
work
they
were
both
silent
it
was
after
breakfast
one
saturday
at
the
end
of
october
the
company
under
the
pretext
of
the
derangement
caused
by
payment
had
on
this
day
once
more
suspended
output
in
all
their
pits
seized
by
panic
at
the
growing
industrial
crisis
and
not
wishing
to
augment
their
already
considerable
stock
they
profited
by
the
smallest
pretexts
to
force
their
ten
thousand
workers
to
rest
you
know
that
étienne
is
waiting
for
you
at
rasseneur
began
maheude
again
take
him
with
you
he
be
more
clever
than
you
are
in
clearing
up
matters
if
they
have
counted
all
your
hours
maheu
nodded
approval
and
just
talk
to
those
gentlemen
about
your
father
affair
the
doctor
on
good
terms
with
the
directors
it
true
is
it
old
un
that
the
doctor
mistaken
and
that
you
can
still
work
for
ten
days
father
bonnemort
with
benumbed
paws
as
he
said
had
remained
nailed
to
his
chair
she
had
to
repeat
her
question
and
he
growled
sure
enough
i
can
work
one
is
done
for
because
one
legs
are
bad
all
that
is
just
stories
they
make
up
so
as
not
to
give
the
pension
maheude
thought
of
the
old
man
forty
sous
which
he
would
perhaps
never
bring
in
any
more
and
she
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
my
god
we
shall
soon
be
all
dead
if
this
goes
on
when
one
is
dead
said
maheu
one
does
get
hungry
he
put
some
nails
into
his
shoes
and
decided
to
set
out
the
settlement
would
not
be
paid
till
towards
four
the
men
did
not
hurry
therefore
but
waited
about
going
off
one
by
one
beset
by
the
women
who
implored
them
to
come
back
at
once
many
gave
them
commissions
to
prevent
them
forgetting
themselves
in
at
rasseneur
étienne
had
received
news
disquieting
rumours
were
flying
about
it
was
said
that
the
company
were
more
and
more
discontented
over
the
timbering
they
were
overwhelming
the
workmen
with
fines
and
a
conflict
appeared
inevitable
that
was
however
only
the
avowed
dispute
beneath
it
there
were
grave
and
secret
causes
of
complication
just
as
étienne
arrived
a
comrade
who
was
drinking
a
glass
on
his
return
from
montsou
was
telling
that
an
announcement
had
been
stuck
up
at
the
cashier
but
he
did
not
quite
know
what
was
on
the
announcement
a
second
entered
then
a
third
and
each
brought
a
different
story
it
seemed
certain
however
that
the
company
had
taken
a
resolution
what
do
you
say
about
it
eh
asked
étienne
sitting
down
near
souvarine
at
a
table
where
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
a
packet
of
tobacco
the
did
not
hurry
but
finished
rolling
his
cigarette
i
say
that
it
was
easy
to
foresee
they
want
to
push
you
to
extremes
he
alone
had
a
sufficiently
keen
intelligence
to
analyse
the
situation
he
explained
it
in
his
quiet
way
the
company
suffering
from
the
crisis
had
been
forced
to
reduce
their
expenses
if
they
were
not
to
succumb
and
it
was
naturally
the
workers
who
would
have
to
tighten
their
bellies
under
some
pretext
or
another
the
company
would
nibble
at
their
wages
for
two
months
the
coal
had
been
remaining
at
the
surface
of
their
pits
and
nearly
all
the
workshops
were
resting
as
the
company
did
not
dare
to
rest
in
this
way
terrified
at
the
ruinous
inaction
they
were
meditating
a
middle
course
perhaps
a
strike
from
which
the
miners
would
come
out
crushed
and
worse
paid
then
the
new
provident
fund
was
disturbing
them
as
it
was
a
threat
for
the
future
while
a
strike
would
relieve
them
of
it
by
exhausting
it
when
it
was
still
small
rasseneur
had
seated
himself
beside
étienne
and
both
of
them
were
listening
in
consternation
they
could
talk
aloud
because
there
was
no
one
there
but
madame
rasseneur
seated
at
the
counter
what
an
idea
murmured
the
innkeeper
what
the
good
of
it
the
company
has
no
interest
in
a
strike
nor
the
men
either
it
would
be
best
to
come
to
an
understanding
this
was
very
sensible
he
was
always
on
the
side
of
reasonable
demands
since
the
rapid
popularity
of
his
old
lodger
he
had
even
exaggerated
this
system
of
possible
progress
saying
they
would
obtain
nothing
if
they
wished
to
have
everything
at
once
in
his
fat
nature
nourished
on
beer
a
secret
jealousy
was
forming
increased
by
the
desertion
of
his
bar
into
which
the
workmen
from
the
voreux
now
came
more
rarely
to
drink
and
to
listen
and
he
thus
sometimes
even
began
to
defend
the
company
forgetting
the
rancour
of
an
old
miner
who
had
been
turned
off
then
you
are
against
the
strike
cried
madame
rasseneur
without
leaving
the
counter
and
as
he
energetically
replied
yes
she
made
him
hold
his
tongue
bah
you
have
no
courage
let
these
gentlemen
speak
étienne
was
meditating
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
glass
which
she
had
served
to
him
at
last
he
raised
his
head
i
dare
say
it
all
true
what
our
mate
tells
us
and
we
must
get
resigned
to
this
strike
if
they
force
it
on
us
pluchart
has
just
written
me
some
very
sensible
things
on
this
matter
he
against
the
strike
too
for
the
men
would
suffer
as
much
as
the
masters
and
it
would
come
to
anything
decisive
only
it
seems
to
him
a
capital
chance
to
get
our
men
to
make
up
their
minds
to
go
into
his
big
machine
here
his
letter
in
fact
pluchart
in
despair
at
the
suspicion
which
the
international
aroused
among
the
miners
at
montsou
was
hoping
to
see
them
enter
in
a
mass
if
they
were
forced
to
fight
against
the
company
in
spite
of
his
efforts
étienne
had
not
been
able
to
place
a
single
member
card
and
he
had
given
his
best
efforts
to
his
provident
fund
which
was
much
better
received
but
this
fund
was
still
so
small
that
it
would
be
quickly
exhausted
as
souvarine
said
and
the
strikers
would
then
inevitably
throw
themselves
into
the
working
men
association
so
that
their
brothers
in
every
country
could
come
to
their
aid
how
much
have
you
in
the
fund
asked
rasseneur
hardly
three
thousand
francs
replied
étienne
and
you
know
that
the
directors
sent
for
me
yesterday
oh
they
were
very
polite
they
repeated
that
they
would
prevent
their
men
from
forming
a
reserve
fund
but
i
quite
understood
that
they
wanted
to
control
it
we
are
bound
to
have
a
struggle
over
that
the
innkeeper
was
walking
up
and
down
whistling
contemptuously
three
thousand
francs
what
can
you
do
with
that
it
would
yield
six
bread
and
if
we
counted
on
foreigners
such
as
the
people
in
england
one
might
go
to
bed
at
once
and
turn
up
one
toes
no
it
was
too
foolish
this
strike
then
for
the
first
time
bitter
words
passed
between
these
two
men
who
usually
agreed
together
at
last
in
their
common
hatred
of
capital
we
shall
see
and
you
what
do
you
say
about
it
repeated
étienne
turning
towards
souvarine
the
latter
replied
with
his
usual
phrase
of
habitual
contempt
a
strike
foolery
then
in
the
midst
of
the
angry
silence
he
added
gently
on
the
whole
i
should
say
no
if
it
amuses
you
it
ruins
the
one
side
and
kills
the
other
and
that
is
always
so
much
cleared
away
only
in
that
way
it
will
take
quite
a
thousand
years
to
renew
the
world
just
begin
by
blowing
up
this
prison
in
which
you
are
all
being
done
to
death
with
his
delicate
hand
he
pointed
out
the
voreux
the
buildings
of
which
could
be
seen
through
the
open
door
but
an
unforeseen
drama
interrupted
him
poland
the
big
tame
rabbit
which
had
ventured
outside
came
bounding
back
fleeing
from
the
stones
of
a
band
of
trammers
and
in
her
terror
with
fallen
ears
and
raised
tail
she
took
refuge
against
his
legs
scratching
and
imploring
him
to
take
her
up
when
he
had
placed
her
on
his
knees
he
sheltered
her
with
both
hands
and
fell
into
that
kind
of
dreamy
somnolence
into
which
the
caress
of
this
soft
warm
fur
always
plunged
him
almost
at
the
same
time
maheu
came
in
he
would
drink
nothing
in
spite
of
the
polite
insistence
of
madame
rasseneur
who
sold
her
beer
as
though
she
made
a
present
of
it
étienne
had
risen
and
both
of
them
set
out
for
montsou
on
at
the
company
yards
montsou
seemed
to
be
in
the
midst
of
a
fete
as
on
fine
sunday
bands
of
miners
arrived
from
all
the
settlements
the
cashier
office
being
very
small
they
preferred
to
wait
at
the
door
stationed
in
groups
on
the
pavement
barring
the
way
in
a
crowd
that
was
constantly
renewed
hucksters
profited
by
the
occasion
and
installed
themselves
with
their
movable
stalls
that
sold
even
pottery
and
cooked
meats
but
it
was
especially
the
estaminets
and
the
bars
which
did
a
good
trade
for
the
miners
before
being
paid
went
to
the
counters
to
get
patience
and
returned
to
them
to
wet
their
pay
as
soon
as
they
had
it
in
their
pockets
but
they
were
very
sensible
except
when
they
finished
it
at
the
volcan
as
maheu
and
étienne
advanced
among
the
groups
they
felt
that
on
that
day
a
deep
exasperation
was
rising
up
it
was
not
the
ordinary
indifference
with
which
the
money
was
taken
and
spent
at
the
publics
fists
were
clenched
and
violent
words
were
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
is
it
true
then
asked
maheu
of
chaval
whom
he
met
before
the
estaminet
piquette
that
they
played
the
dirty
trick
but
chaval
contented
himself
by
replying
with
a
furious
growl
throwing
a
sidelong
look
on
étienne
since
the
working
had
been
renewed
he
had
hired
himself
on
with
others
more
and
more
bitten
by
envy
against
this
comrade
the
who
posed
as
a
boss
and
whose
boots
as
he
said
were
licked
by
the
whole
settlement
this
was
complicated
by
a
jealousy
he
never
took
catherine
to
réquillart
now
or
behind
the
without
accusing
her
in
abominable
language
of
sleeping
with
her
mother
lodger
then
seized
by
savage
desire
he
would
stifle
her
with
caresses
maheu
asked
him
another
question
is
it
the
voreux
turn
now
and
when
he
turned
his
back
after
nodding
affirmatively
both
men
decided
to
enter
the
yards
the
was
a
small
rectangular
room
divided
in
two
by
a
grating
on
the
forms
along
the
wall
five
or
six
miners
were
waiting
while
the
cashier
assisted
by
a
clerk
was
paying
another
who
stood
before
the
wicket
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
above
the
form
on
the
left
a
yellow
placard
was
stuck
up
quite
fresh
against
the
smoky
grey
of
the
plaster
and
it
was
in
front
of
this
that
the
men
had
been
constantly
passing
all
the
morning
they
entered
two
or
three
at
a
time
stood
in
front
of
it
and
then
went
away
without
a
word
shrugging
their
shoulders
as
if
their
backs
were
crushed
two
colliers
were
just
then
standing
in
front
of
the
announcement
a
young
one
with
a
square
brutish
head
and
a
very
thin
old
one
his
face
dull
with
age
neither
of
them
could
read
the
young
one
spelt
moving
his
lips
the
old
one
contented
himself
with
gazing
stupidly
many
came
in
thus
to
look
without
understanding
read
us
that
there
said
maheu
who
was
not
very
strong
either
in
reading
to
his
companion
then
étienne
began
to
read
him
the
announcement
it
was
a
notice
from
the
company
to
the
miners
of
all
the
pits
informing
them
that
in
consequence
of
the
lack
of
care
bestowed
on
the
timbering
and
being
weary
of
inflicting
useless
fines
the
company
had
resolved
to
apply
a
new
method
of
payment
for
the
extraction
of
coal
henceforward
they
would
pay
for
the
timbering
separately
by
the
cubic
metre
of
wood
taken
down
and
used
based
on
the
quantity
necessary
for
good
work
the
price
of
the
tub
of
coal
extracted
would
naturally
be
lowered
in
the
proportion
of
fifty
centimes
to
forty
according
to
the
nature
and
distance
of
the
cuttings
and
a
somewhat
obscure
calculation
endeavoured
to
show
that
this
diminution
of
ten
centimes
would
be
exactly
compensated
by
the
price
of
the
timbering
the
company
added
also
that
wishing
to
leave
every
one
time
to
convince
himself
of
the
advantages
presented
by
this
new
scheme
they
did
not
propose
to
apply
it
till
monday
the
of
december
do
read
so
loud
over
there
shouted
the
cashier
we
ca
hear
what
we
are
saying
étienne
finished
reading
without
paying
attention
to
this
observation
his
voice
trembled
and
when
he
had
reached
the
end
they
all
continued
to
gaze
steadily
at
the
placard
the
old
miner
and
the
young
one
looked
as
though
they
expected
something
more
then
they
went
away
with
depressed
shoulders
good
god
muttered
maheu
he
and
his
companions
sat
down
absorbed
with
lowered
heads
and
while
files
of
men
continued
to
pass
before
the
yellow
paper
they
made
calculations
were
they
being
made
fun
of
they
could
never
make
up
with
the
timbering
for
the
ten
centimes
taken
off
the
tram
at
most
they
could
only
get
to
eight
centimes
so
the
company
would
be
robbing
them
of
two
centimes
without
counting
the
time
taken
by
careful
work
this
then
was
what
this
disguised
lowering
of
wages
really
came
to
the
company
was
economizing
out
of
the
miners
pockets
good
lord
good
lord
repeated
maheu
raising
his
head
we
should
be
bloody
fools
if
we
took
that
but
the
wicket
being
free
he
went
up
to
be
paid
the
heads
only
of
the
workings
presented
themselves
at
the
desk
and
then
divided
the
money
between
their
men
to
save
time
maheu
and
associates
said
the
clerk
filonniére
seam
cutting
no
he
searched
through
the
lists
which
were
prepared
from
the
inspection
of
the
tickets
on
which
the
captains
stated
every
day
for
each
stall
the
number
of
trams
extracted
then
he
repeated
maheu
and
associates
filonniére
seam
cutting
no
one
hundred
and
francs
the
cashier
paid
beg
pardon
sir
stammered
the
pikeman
in
surprise
are
you
sure
you
have
not
made
a
mistake
he
looked
at
this
small
sum
of
money
without
picking
it
up
frozen
by
a
shudder
which
went
to
his
heart
it
was
true
he
was
expecting
bad
payment
but
it
could
not
come
to
so
little
or
he
must
have
calculated
wrong
when
he
had
given
their
shares
to
zacharie
étienne
and
the
other
mate
who
replaced
chaval
there
would
remain
at
most
fifty
francs
for
himself
his
father
catherine
and
jeanlin
no
no
i
made
no
mistake
replied
the
clerk
there
are
two
sundays
and
four
rest
days
to
be
taken
off
that
makes
nine
days
of
work
maheu
followed
this
calculation
in
a
low
voice
nine
days
gave
him
about
thirty
francs
eighteen
to
catherine
nine
to
jeanlin
as
to
father
bonnemort
he
only
had
three
days
no
matter
by
adding
the
ninety
francs
of
zacharie
and
the
two
mates
that
would
surely
make
more
and
do
forget
the
fines
added
the
clerk
twenty
francs
for
fines
for
defective
timbering
the
pikeman
made
a
gesture
of
despair
twenty
francs
of
fines
four
days
of
rest
that
made
out
the
account
to
think
that
he
had
once
brought
back
a
fortnight
pay
of
full
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
when
father
bonnemort
was
working
and
zacharie
had
not
yet
set
up
house
for
himself
well
are
you
going
to
take
it
cried
the
cashier
impatiently
you
can
see
there
someone
else
waiting
if
you
do
want
it
say
so
as
maheu
decided
to
pick
up
the
money
with
his
large
trembling
hand
the
clerk
stopped
him
wait
i
have
your
name
here
toussaint
maheu
is
it
not
the
general
secretary
wishes
to
speak
to
you
go
in
he
is
alone
the
dazed
workman
found
himself
in
an
office
furnished
with
old
mahogany
upholstered
with
faded
green
and
he
listened
for
five
minutes
to
the
general
secretary
a
tall
sallow
gentleman
who
spoke
to
him
over
the
papers
of
his
bureau
without
rising
but
the
buzzing
in
his
ears
prevented
him
from
hearing
he
understood
vaguely
that
the
question
of
his
father
retirement
would
be
taken
into
consideration
with
the
pension
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
fifty
years
of
age
and
forty
years
service
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
voice
became
harder
there
was
a
reprimand
he
was
accused
of
occupying
himself
with
politics
an
allusion
was
made
to
his
lodger
and
the
provident
fund
finally
he
was
advised
not
to
compromise
himself
with
these
follies
he
who
was
one
of
the
best
workmen
in
the
mine
he
wished
to
protest
but
could
only
pronounce
words
at
random
twisting
his
cap
between
his
feverish
fingers
and
he
retired
stuttering
certainly
sir
i
can
assure
you
sir
outside
when
he
had
found
étienne
who
waiting
for
him
he
broke
out
well
i
am
a
bloody
fool
i
ought
to
have
replied
not
enough
money
to
get
bread
and
insults
as
well
yes
he
has
been
talking
against
you
he
told
me
the
settlement
was
being
poisoned
and
what
to
be
done
good
god
bend
one
back
and
say
thank
you
he
right
that
the
wisest
plan
maheu
fell
silent
overcome
at
once
by
rage
and
fear
étienne
was
gloomily
thinking
once
more
they
traversed
the
groups
who
blocked
the
road
the
exasperation
was
growing
the
exasperation
of
a
calm
race
the
muttered
warning
of
a
storm
without
violent
gestures
terrible
to
see
above
this
solid
mass
a
few
men
understanding
accounts
had
made
calculations
and
the
two
centimes
gained
by
the
company
over
the
wood
were
rumoured
about
and
excited
the
hardest
heads
but
it
was
especially
the
rage
over
this
disastrous
pay
the
rebellion
of
hunger
against
the
rest
days
and
the
fines
already
there
was
not
enough
to
eat
and
what
would
happen
if
wages
were
still
further
lowered
in
the
estaminets
the
anger
grew
loud
and
fury
so
dried
their
throats
that
the
little
money
taken
went
over
the
counters
from
montsou
to
the
settlement
étienne
and
maheu
never
exchanged
a
word
when
the
latter
entered
maheude
who
was
alone
with
the
children
noticed
immediately
that
his
hands
were
empty
well
you
a
nice
one
she
said
where
my
coffee
and
my
sugar
and
the
meat
a
bit
of
veal
would
have
ruined
you
he
made
no
reply
stifled
by
the
emotion
he
had
been
keeping
back
then
the
coarse
face
of
this
man
hardened
to
work
in
the
mines
became
swollen
with
despair
and
large
tears
broke
from
his
eyes
and
fell
in
a
warm
rain
he
had
thrown
himself
into
a
chair
weeping
like
a
child
and
throwing
fifty
francs
on
the
table
here
he
stammered
that
what
i
brought
you
back
that
our
work
for
all
of
us
maheude
looked
at
étienne
and
saw
that
he
was
silent
and
overwhelmed
then
she
also
wept
how
were
nine
people
to
live
for
a
fortnight
on
fifty
francs
her
eldest
son
had
left
them
the
old
man
could
no
longer
move
his
legs
it
would
soon
mean
death
alzire
threw
herself
round
her
mother
neck
overcome
on
hearing
her
weep
estelle
was
howling
lénore
and
henri
were
sobbing
and
from
the
entire
settlement
there
soon
arose
the
same
cry
of
wretchedness
the
men
had
come
back
and
each
household
was
lamenting
the
disaster
of
this
bad
pay
the
doors
opened
women
appeared
crying
aloud
outside
as
if
their
complaints
could
not
be
held
beneath
the
ceilings
of
these
small
houses
a
fine
rain
was
falling
but
they
did
not
feel
it
they
called
one
another
from
the
pavements
they
showed
one
another
in
the
hollow
of
their
hands
the
money
they
had
received
look
they
given
him
this
do
they
want
to
make
fools
of
people
as
for
me
see
i
have
got
enough
to
pay
for
the
fortnight
bread
with
and
just
count
mine
i
should
have
to
sell
my
shifts
maheude
had
come
out
like
the
others
a
group
had
formed
around
the
levaque
woman
who
was
shouting
loudest
of
all
for
her
drunkard
of
a
husband
had
not
even
turned
up
and
she
knew
that
large
or
small
the
pay
would
melt
away
at
the
volcan
philoméne
watched
maheu
so
that
zacharie
should
not
get
hold
of
the
money
pierronne
was
the
only
one
who
seemed
fairly
calm
for
that
sneak
of
a
pierron
always
arranged
things
no
one
knew
how
so
as
to
have
more
hours
on
the
ticket
than
his
mates
but
mother
brulé
thought
this
cowardly
of
her
she
was
among
the
enraged
lean
and
erect
in
the
midst
of
the
group
with
her
fists
stretched
towards
montsou
to
think
she
cried
without
naming
the
hennebeaus
that
this
morning
i
saw
their
servant
go
by
in
a
carriage
yes
the
cook
in
a
carriage
with
two
horses
going
to
marchiennes
to
get
fish
sure
enough
a
clamour
arose
and
the
abuse
began
again
that
servant
in
a
white
apron
taken
to
the
market
of
the
neighbouring
town
in
her
carriage
aroused
indignation
while
the
workers
were
dying
of
hunger
they
must
have
their
fish
at
all
costs
perhaps
they
would
not
always
be
able
to
eat
their
fish
the
turn
of
the
poor
people
would
come
and
the
ideas
sown
by
étienne
sprang
up
and
expanded
in
this
cry
of
revolt
it
was
impatience
before
the
promised
age
of
gold
a
haste
to
get
a
share
of
the
happiness
beyond
this
horizon
of
misery
closed
in
like
the
grave
the
injustice
was
becoming
too
great
at
last
they
would
demand
their
rights
since
the
bread
was
being
taken
out
of
their
mouths
the
women
especially
would
have
liked
at
once
to
take
by
assault
this
ideal
city
of
progress
in
which
there
was
to
be
no
more
wretchedness
it
was
almost
night
and
the
rain
increased
while
they
were
still
filling
the
settlement
with
their
tears
in
the
midst
of
the
screaming
of
the
children
that
evening
at
the
avantage
the
strike
was
decided
on
rasseneur
no
longer
struggled
against
it
and
souvarine
accepted
it
as
a
first
step
étienne
summed
up
the
situation
in
a
word
if
the
company
really
wanted
a
strike
then
the
company
should
have
a
strike
chapter
v
a
week
passed
and
work
went
on
suspiciously
and
mournfully
in
expectation
of
the
conflict
among
the
maheus
the
fortnight
threatened
to
be
more
meagre
than
ever
maheude
grew
bitter
in
spite
of
her
moderation
and
good
sense
her
daughter
catherine
too
had
taken
it
into
her
head
to
stay
out
one
night
on
the
following
morning
she
came
back
so
weary
and
ill
after
this
adventure
that
she
was
not
able
to
go
to
the
pit
and
she
told
with
tears
how
it
was
not
her
fault
for
chaval
had
kept
her
threatening
to
beat
her
if
she
ran
away
he
was
becoming
mad
with
jealousy
and
wished
to
prevent
her
from
returning
to
étienne
bed
where
he
well
knew
he
said
that
the
family
made
her
sleep
maheude
was
furious
and
after
forbidding
her
daughter
ever
to
see
such
a
brute
again
talked
of
going
to
montsou
to
box
his
ears
but
all
the
same
it
was
a
day
lost
and
the
girl
now
that
she
had
this
lover
preferred
not
to
change
him
two
days
after
there
was
another
incident
on
monday
and
tuesday
jeanlin
who
was
supposed
to
be
quietly
engaged
on
his
task
at
the
voreux
had
escaped
to
run
away
into
the
marshes
and
the
forest
of
vandame
with
bébert
and
lydie
he
had
seduced
them
no
one
knew
to
what
plunder
or
to
what
games
of
precocious
children
they
had
all
three
given
themselves
up
he
received
a
vigorous
punishment
a
whipping
which
his
mother
applied
to
him
on
the
pavement
outside
before
the
terrified
children
of
the
settlement
who
could
have
thought
such
a
thing
of
children
belonging
to
her
who
had
cost
so
much
since
their
birth
and
who
ought
now
to
be
bringing
something
in
and
in
this
cry
there
was
the
remembrance
of
her
own
hard
youth
of
the
hereditary
misery
which
made
of
each
little
one
in
the
brood
a
later
on
that
morning
when
the
men
and
the
girl
set
out
for
the
pit
maheude
sat
up
in
her
bed
to
say
to
jeanlin
you
know
that
if
you
begin
that
game
again
you
little
beast
take
the
skin
off
your
bottom
in
maheu
new
stall
the
work
was
hard
this
part
of
the
filonniére
seam
was
so
thin
that
the
pikemen
squeezed
between
the
wall
and
the
roof
grazed
their
elbows
at
their
work
it
was
too
becoming
very
damp
from
hour
to
hour
they
feared
a
rush
of
water
one
of
those
sudden
torrents
which
burst
through
rocks
and
carry
away
men
the
day
before
as
étienne
was
violently
driving
in
his
pick
and
drawing
it
out
he
had
received
a
jet
of
water
in
his
face
but
this
was
only
an
alarm
the
cutting
simply
became
damper
and
more
unwholesome
besides
he
now
thought
nothing
of
possible
accidents
he
forgot
himself
there
with
his
mates
careless
of
peril
they
lived
in
without
even
feeling
its
weight
on
their
eyelids
the
veil
which
it
left
on
the
eyelashes
sometimes
when
the
flame
of
the
lamps
grew
paler
and
bluer
than
usual
it
attracted
attention
and
a
miner
would
put
his
head
against
the
seam
to
listen
to
the
low
noise
of
the
gas
a
noise
of
escaping
from
each
crack
but
the
constant
threat
was
of
landslips
for
besides
the
insufficiency
of
the
timbering
always
patched
up
too
quickly
the
soil
soaked
with
water
would
not
hold
three
times
during
the
day
maheu
had
been
obliged
to
add
to
the
planking
it
was
two
and
the
men
would
soon
have
to
ascend
lying
on
his
side
étienne
was
finishing
the
cutting
of
a
block
when
a
distant
growl
of
thunder
shook
the
whole
mine
what
that
then
he
cried
putting
down
his
axe
to
listen
he
had
at
first
thought
that
the
gallery
was
falling
in
behind
his
back
but
maheu
had
already
glided
along
the
slope
of
the
cutting
saying
it
a
fall
quick
quick
all
tumbled
down
and
hastened
carried
away
by
an
impulse
of
anxious
fraternity
their
lamps
danced
at
their
wrists
in
the
deathly
silence
which
had
fallen
they
rushed
in
single
file
along
the
passages
with
bent
backs
as
though
they
were
galloping
on
all
fours
and
without
slowing
this
gallop
they
asked
each
other
questions
and
threw
brief
replies
where
was
it
then
in
the
cuttings
perhaps
no
it
came
from
below
no
from
the
haulage
when
they
arrived
at
the
chimney
passage
they
threw
themselves
into
it
tumbling
one
over
the
other
without
troubling
about
bruises
jeanlin
with
skin
still
red
from
the
whipping
of
the
day
before
had
not
run
away
from
the
pit
on
this
day
he
was
trotting
with
naked
feet
behind
his
tram
closing
the
ventilation
doors
one
by
one
when
he
was
not
afraid
of
meeting
a
captain
he
jumped
on
to
the
last
tram
which
he
was
not
allowed
to
do
for
fear
he
should
go
to
sleep
but
his
great
amusement
was
whenever
the
tram
was
shunted
to
let
another
one
pass
to
go
and
join
bébert
who
was
holding
the
reins
in
front
he
would
come
up
slyly
without
his
lamp
and
vigorously
pinch
his
companion
inventing
mischievous
monkey
tricks
with
his
yellow
hair
his
large
ears
his
lean
muzzle
lit
up
by
little
green
eyes
shining
in
the
darkness
with
morbid
precocity
he
seemed
to
have
the
obscure
intelligence
and
the
quick
skill
of
a
human
abortion
which
had
returned
to
its
animal
ways
in
the
afternoon
mouque
brought
bataille
whose
turn
it
was
to
the
trammers
and
as
the
horse
was
snuffing
in
the
shunting
jeanlin
who
had
glided
up
to
bébert
asked
him
what
the
matter
with
the
old
hack
to
stop
short
like
that
break
my
legs
bébert
could
not
reply
he
had
to
hold
in
bataille
who
was
growing
lively
at
the
approach
of
the
other
tram
the
horse
had
smelled
from
afar
his
comrade
trompette
for
whom
he
had
felt
great
tenderness
ever
since
the
day
when
he
had
seen
him
disembarked
in
the
pit
one
might
say
that
it
was
the
affectionate
pity
of
an
old
philosopher
anxious
to
console
a
young
friend
by
imparting
to
him
his
own
resignation
and
patience
for
trompette
did
not
become
reconciled
drawing
his
trams
without
any
taste
for
the
work
standing
with
lowered
head
blinded
by
the
darkness
and
for
ever
regretting
the
sun
so
every
time
that
bataille
met
him
he
put
out
his
head
snorting
and
moistened
him
with
an
encouraging
caress
by
god
swore
bébert
there
they
are
licking
each
other
skins
again
then
when
trompette
had
passed
he
replied
on
the
subject
of
bataille
oh
he
a
cunning
old
beast
when
he
stops
like
that
it
because
he
guesses
there
something
in
the
way
a
stone
or
a
hole
and
he
takes
care
of
himself
he
does
want
to
break
his
bones
i
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
down
there
after
the
door
he
pushed
it
and
stood
did
you
see
anything
no
said
jeanlin
there
water
i
got
it
up
to
my
knees
the
tram
set
out
again
and
on
the
following
journey
when
he
had
opened
the
ventilation
door
with
a
blow
from
his
head
bataille
again
refused
to
advance
neighing
and
trembling
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
and
set
off
with
a
bound
jeanlin
who
closed
the
door
had
remained
behind
he
bent
down
and
looked
at
the
mud
through
which
he
was
paddling
then
raising
his
lamp
he
saw
that
the
wood
had
given
way
beneath
the
continual
bleeding
of
a
spring
just
then
a
pikeman
one
berloque
who
was
called
chicot
had
arrived
from
his
cutting
in
a
hurry
to
go
to
his
wife
who
had
just
been
confined
he
also
stopped
and
examined
the
planking
and
suddenly
as
the
boy
was
starting
to
rejoin
his
train
a
tremendous
cracking
sound
was
heard
and
a
landslip
engulfed
the
man
and
the
child
there
was
deep
silence
a
thick
dust
raised
by
the
wind
of
the
fall
passed
through
the
passages
blinded
and
choked
the
miners
came
from
every
part
even
from
the
farthest
stalls
with
their
dancing
lamps
which
feebly
lighted
up
this
gallop
of
black
men
at
the
bottom
of
these
molehills
when
the
first
men
tumbled
against
the
landslip
they
shouted
out
and
called
their
mates
a
second
band
come
from
the
cutting
below
found
themselves
on
the
other
side
of
the
mass
of
earth
which
stopped
up
the
gallery
it
was
at
once
seen
that
the
roof
had
fallen
in
for
a
dozen
metres
at
most
the
damage
was
not
serious
but
all
hearts
were
contracted
when
a
was
heard
from
the
ruins
bébert
leaving
his
tram
ran
up
repeating
jeanlin
is
underneath
jeanlin
is
underneath
maheu
at
this
very
moment
had
come
out
of
the
passage
with
zacharie
and
étienne
he
was
seized
with
the
fury
of
despair
and
could
only
utter
oaths
my
god
my
god
my
god
catherine
lydie
and
mouquette
who
had
also
rushed
up
began
to
sob
and
shriek
with
terror
in
the
midst
of
the
fearful
disorder
which
was
increased
by
the
darkness
the
men
tried
to
make
them
be
silent
but
they
shrieked
louder
as
each
groan
was
heard
the
captain
richomme
had
come
up
running
in
despair
that
neither
négrel
the
engineer
nor
dansaert
was
at
the
pit
with
his
ear
pressed
against
the
rocks
he
listened
and
at
last
said
those
sounds
could
not
come
from
a
child
a
man
must
certainly
be
there
maheu
had
already
called
jeanlin
twenty
times
over
not
a
breath
was
heard
the
little
one
must
have
been
smashed
up
and
still
the
groans
continued
monotonously
they
spoke
to
the
agonized
man
asking
him
his
name
the
groaning
alone
replied
look
sharp
repeated
richomme
who
had
already
organized
a
rescue
we
can
talk
afterwards
from
each
end
the
miners
attacked
the
landslip
with
pick
and
shovel
chaval
worked
without
a
word
beside
maheu
and
étienne
while
zacharie
superintended
the
removal
of
the
earth
the
hour
for
ascent
had
come
and
no
one
had
touched
food
but
they
could
not
go
up
for
their
soup
while
their
mates
were
in
peril
they
realized
however
that
the
settlement
would
be
disturbed
if
no
one
came
back
and
it
was
proposed
to
send
off
the
women
but
neither
catherine
nor
mouquette
nor
even
lydie
would
move
nailed
to
the
spot
with
a
desire
to
know
what
had
happened
and
to
help
levaque
then
accepted
the
commission
of
announcing
the
landslip
up
above
a
simple
accident
which
was
being
repaired
it
was
nearly
four
in
less
than
an
hour
the
men
had
done
a
day
work
half
the
earth
would
have
already
been
removed
if
more
rocks
had
not
slid
from
the
roof
maheu
persisted
with
such
energy
that
he
refused
with
a
furious
gesture
when
another
man
approached
to
relieve
him
for
a
moment
gently
said
richomme
at
last
we
are
getting
near
we
must
not
finish
them
off
in
fact
the
groaning
was
becoming
more
and
more
distinct
it
was
a
continuous
rattling
which
guided
the
workers
and
now
it
seemed
to
be
beneath
their
very
picks
suddenly
it
stopped
in
silence
they
all
looked
at
one
another
and
shuddered
as
they
felt
the
coldness
of
death
pass
in
the
darkness
they
dug
on
soaked
in
sweat
their
muscles
tense
to
breaking
they
came
upon
a
foot
and
then
began
to
remove
the
earth
with
their
hands
freeing
the
limbs
one
by
one
the
head
was
not
hurt
they
turned
their
lamps
on
it
and
name
went
round
he
was
quite
warm
with
his
spinal
column
broken
by
a
rock
wrap
him
up
in
a
covering
and
put
him
in
a
tram
ordered
the
captain
now
for
the
lad
look
sharp
maheu
gave
a
last
blow
and
an
opening
was
made
communicating
with
the
men
who
were
clearing
away
the
soil
from
the
other
side
they
shouted
out
that
they
had
just
found
jeanlin
unconscious
with
both
legs
broken
still
breathing
it
was
the
father
who
took
up
the
little
one
in
his
arms
with
clenched
jaws
constantly
uttering
my
god
to
express
his
grief
while
catherine
and
the
other
women
again
began
to
shriek
a
procession
was
quickly
formed
bébert
had
brought
back
bataille
who
was
harnessed
to
the
trams
in
the
first
lay
chicot
corpse
supported
by
étienne
in
the
second
maheu
was
seated
with
jeanlin
still
unconscious
on
his
knees
covered
by
a
strip
of
wool
torn
from
the
ventilation
door
they
started
at
a
walking
pace
on
each
tram
was
a
lamp
like
a
red
star
then
behind
followed
the
row
of
miners
some
fifty
shadows
in
single
file
now
that
they
were
overcome
by
fatigue
they
trailed
their
feet
slipping
in
the
mud
with
the
mournful
melancholy
of
a
flock
stricken
by
an
epidemic
it
took
them
nearly
half
an
hour
to
reach
the
this
procession
beneath
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
deep
darkness
seemed
never
to
end
through
galleries
which
bifurcated
and
turned
and
unrolled
at
the
richomme
who
had
gone
on
before
had
ordered
an
empty
cage
to
be
reserved
pierron
immediately
loaded
the
two
trams
in
the
first
maheu
remained
with
his
wounded
little
one
on
his
knees
while
in
the
other
étienne
kept
chicot
corpse
between
his
arms
to
hold
it
up
when
the
men
had
piled
themselves
up
in
the
other
decks
the
cage
rose
it
took
two
minutes
the
rain
from
the
tubbing
fell
very
cold
and
the
men
looked
up
towards
the
air
impatient
to
see
daylight
fortunately
a
trammer
sent
to
vanderhaghen
had
found
him
and
brought
him
back
jeanlin
and
the
dead
man
were
placed
in
the
room
where
from
year
end
to
year
end
a
large
fire
burnt
a
row
of
buckets
with
warm
water
was
ready
for
washing
feet
and
two
mattresses
having
been
spread
on
the
floor
the
man
and
the
child
were
placed
on
them
maheu
and
étienne
alone
entered
outside
putters
miners
and
boys
were
running
about
forming
groups
and
talking
in
a
low
voice
as
soon
as
the
doctor
had
glanced
at
chicot
done
for
you
can
wash
him
two
overseers
undressed
and
then
washed
with
a
sponge
this
corpse
blackened
with
coal
and
still
dirty
with
the
sweat
of
work
nothing
wrong
with
the
head
said
the
doctor
again
kneeling
on
jeanlin
mattress
nor
the
chest
either
ah
it
the
legs
which
have
given
he
himself
undressed
the
child
unfastening
the
cap
taking
off
the
jacket
drawing
off
the
breeches
and
shirt
with
the
skill
of
a
nurse
and
the
poor
little
body
appeared
as
lean
as
an
insect
stained
with
black
dust
and
yellow
earth
marbled
by
bloody
patches
nothing
could
be
made
out
and
they
had
to
wash
him
also
he
seemed
to
grow
leaner
beneath
the
sponge
the
flesh
so
pallid
and
transparent
that
one
could
see
the
bones
it
was
a
pity
to
look
on
this
last
degeneration
of
a
wretched
race
this
mere
nothing
that
was
suffering
and
half
crushed
by
the
falling
of
the
rocks
when
he
was
clean
they
perceived
the
bruises
on
the
thighs
two
red
patches
on
the
white
skin
jeanlin
awaking
from
his
faint
moaned
standing
up
at
the
foot
of
the
mattress
with
hands
hanging
down
maheu
was
looking
at
him
and
large
tears
rolled
from
his
eyes
eh
are
you
the
father
said
the
doctor
raising
his
eyes
no
need
to
cry
then
you
can
see
he
is
not
dead
help
me
instead
he
found
two
simple
fractures
but
the
right
leg
gave
him
some
anxiety
it
would
probably
have
to
be
cut
off
at
this
moment
the
engineer
négrel
and
dansaert
who
had
been
informed
came
up
with
richomme
the
first
listened
to
the
narrative
with
an
exasperated
air
he
broke
out
always
this
cursed
timbering
had
he
not
repeated
a
hundred
times
that
they
would
leave
their
men
down
there
and
those
brutes
who
talked
about
going
out
on
strike
if
they
were
forced
to
timber
more
solidly
the
worst
was
that
now
the
company
would
have
to
pay
for
the
broken
pots
hennebeau
would
be
pleased
who
is
it
he
asked
of
dansaert
who
was
standing
in
silence
before
the
corpse
which
was
being
wrapped
up
in
a
sheet
chicot
one
of
our
good
workers
replied
the
chief
captain
he
has
three
children
poor
chap
vanderhaghen
ordered
jeanlin
immediate
removal
to
his
parents
six
struck
twilight
was
already
coming
on
and
they
would
do
well
to
remove
the
corpse
also
the
engineer
gave
orders
to
harness
the
van
and
to
bring
a
stretcher
the
wounded
child
was
placed
on
the
stretcher
while
the
mattress
and
the
dead
body
were
put
into
the
van
some
putters
were
still
standing
at
the
door
talking
with
some
miners
who
were
waiting
about
to
look
on
when
the
door
reopened
there
was
silence
in
the
group
a
new
procession
was
then
formed
the
van
in
front
then
the
stretcher
and
then
the
train
of
people
they
left
the
mine
square
and
went
slowly
up
the
road
to
the
settlement
the
first
november
cold
had
denuded
the
immense
plain
the
night
was
now
slowly
burying
it
like
a
shroud
fallen
from
the
livid
sky
étienne
then
in
a
low
voice
advised
maheu
to
send
catherine
on
to
warn
maheude
so
as
to
soften
the
blow
the
overwhelmed
father
who
was
following
the
stretcher
agreed
with
a
nod
and
the
young
girl
set
out
running
for
they
were
now
near
but
the
van
that
gloomy
box
was
already
signalled
women
ran
out
wildly
on
to
the
paths
three
or
four
rushed
about
in
anguish
without
their
bonnets
soon
there
were
thirty
of
them
then
fifty
all
choking
with
the
same
terror
then
someone
was
dead
who
was
it
the
story
told
by
levaque
after
first
reassuring
them
now
exaggerated
their
nightmare
it
was
not
one
man
it
was
ten
who
had
perished
and
who
were
now
being
brought
back
in
the
van
one
by
one
catherine
found
her
mother
agitated
by
a
presentiment
and
after
hearing
the
first
stammered
words
maheude
cried
the
father
dead
the
young
girl
protested
in
vain
speaking
of
jeanlin
without
hearing
her
maheude
had
rushed
forward
and
on
seeing
the
van
which
was
passing
before
the
church
she
grew
faint
and
pale
the
women
at
their
doors
mute
with
terror
were
stretching
out
their
necks
while
others
followed
trembling
as
they
wondered
before
whose
house
the
procession
would
stop
the
vehicle
passed
and
behind
it
maheude
saw
maheu
who
was
accompanying
the
stretcher
then
when
they
had
placed
the
stretcher
at
her
door
and
when
she
saw
jeanlin
alive
with
his
legs
broken
there
was
so
sudden
a
reaction
in
her
that
she
choked
with
anger
stammering
without
tears
is
this
it
they
cripple
our
little
ones
now
both
legs
my
god
what
do
they
want
me
to
do
with
him
be
still
then
said
vanderhaghen
who
had
followed
to
attend
to
jeanlin
would
you
rather
he
had
remained
below
but
maheude
grew
more
furious
while
alzire
lénore
and
henri
were
crying
around
her
as
she
helped
to
carry
up
the
wounded
boy
and
to
give
the
doctor
what
he
needed
she
cursed
fate
and
asked
where
she
was
to
find
money
to
feed
invalids
the
old
man
was
not
then
enough
now
this
rascal
too
had
lost
his
legs
and
she
never
ceased
while
other
cries
more
lamentations
were
heard
from
a
neighbouring
house
chicot
wife
and
children
were
weeping
over
the
body
it
was
now
quite
night
the
exhausted
miners
were
at
last
eating
their
soup
and
the
settlement
had
fallen
into
a
melancholy
silence
only
disturbed
by
these
loud
outcries
three
weeks
passed
it
was
found
possible
to
avoid
amputation
jeanlin
kept
both
his
legs
but
he
remained
lame
on
investigation
the
company
had
resigned
itself
to
giving
a
donation
of
fifty
francs
it
had
also
promised
to
find
employment
for
the
little
cripple
at
the
surface
as
soon
as
he
was
well
all
the
same
their
misery
was
aggravated
for
the
father
had
received
such
a
shock
that
he
was
seriously
ill
with
fever
since
thursday
maheu
had
been
back
at
the
pit
and
it
was
now
sunday
in
the
evening
étienne
talked
of
the
approaching
date
of
the
of
december
preoccupied
in
wondering
if
the
company
would
execute
its
threat
they
sat
up
till
ten
waiting
for
catherine
who
must
have
been
delaying
with
chaval
but
she
did
not
return
maheude
furiously
bolted
the
door
without
a
word
étienne
was
long
in
going
to
sleep
restless
at
the
thought
of
that
empty
bed
in
which
alzire
occupied
so
little
room
next
morning
she
was
still
absent
and
it
was
only
in
the
afternoon
on
returning
from
the
pit
that
the
maheus
learnt
that
chaval
was
keeping
catherine
he
created
such
abominable
scenes
with
her
that
she
had
decided
to
stay
with
him
to
avoid
reproaches
he
had
suddenly
left
the
voreux
and
had
been
taken
on
at
deneulin
mine
and
she
had
followed
him
as
a
putter
the
new
household
still
lived
at
montsou
at
piquette
maheu
at
first
talked
of
going
to
fight
the
man
and
of
bringing
his
daughter
back
with
a
kick
in
the
backside
then
he
made
a
gesture
of
resignation
what
was
the
good
it
always
turned
out
like
that
one
could
not
prevent
a
girl
from
sticking
to
a
man
when
she
wanted
to
it
was
much
better
to
wait
quietly
for
the
marriage
but
maheude
did
not
take
things
so
easily
did
i
beat
her
when
she
took
this
chaval
she
cried
to
étienne
who
listened
in
silence
very
pale
see
now
tell
me
you
who
are
a
sensible
man
we
have
left
her
free
have
we
because
my
god
they
all
come
to
it
now
i
was
in
the
family
way
when
the
father
married
me
but
i
did
run
away
from
my
parents
and
i
should
never
have
done
so
dirty
a
trick
as
to
carry
the
money
i
earned
to
a
man
who
had
no
want
of
it
before
the
proper
age
ah
it
disgusting
you
know
people
will
leave
off
getting
children
and
as
étienne
still
replied
only
by
nodding
his
head
she
insisted
a
girl
who
went
out
every
evening
where
she
wanted
to
what
has
she
got
in
her
skin
then
not
to
be
able
to
wait
till
i
married
her
after
she
had
helped
to
get
us
out
of
difficulties
eh
it
natural
one
has
a
daughter
to
work
but
there
we
have
been
too
good
we
ought
not
to
let
her
go
and
amuse
herself
with
a
man
give
them
an
inch
and
they
take
an
ell
alzire
nodded
approvingly
lénore
and
henri
overcome
by
this
storm
cried
quietly
while
the
mother
now
enumerated
their
misfortunes
first
zacharie
who
had
had
to
get
married
then
old
bonnemort
who
was
there
on
his
chair
with
his
twisted
feet
then
jeanlin
who
could
not
leave
the
room
for
ten
days
with
his
bones
and
now
as
a
last
blow
this
jade
catherine
who
had
gone
away
with
a
man
the
whole
family
was
breaking
up
there
was
only
the
father
left
at
the
pit
how
were
they
to
live
seven
persons
without
counting
estelle
on
his
three
francs
they
might
as
well
jump
into
the
canal
in
a
band
it
wo
do
any
good
to
worry
yourself
said
maheu
in
a
low
voice
perhaps
we
have
not
got
to
the
end
étienne
who
was
looking
fixedly
at
the
flags
on
the
floor
raised
his
head
and
murmured
with
eyes
lost
in
a
vision
of
the
future
ah
it
is
time
it
is
time
part
four
chapter
i
on
that
monday
the
hennebeaus
had
invited
the
grégoires
and
their
daughter
cécile
to
lunch
they
had
formed
their
plans
on
rising
from
table
paul
négrel
was
to
take
the
ladies
to
a
mine
which
had
been
luxuriously
reinstalled
but
this
was
only
an
amiable
pretext
this
party
was
an
invention
of
madame
hennebeau
to
hasten
the
marriage
of
cécile
and
paul
suddenly
on
this
very
monday
at
four
in
the
morning
the
strike
broke
out
when
on
the
of
december
the
company
had
adopted
the
new
wage
system
the
miners
remained
calm
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
not
one
made
the
least
protest
on
everybody
from
the
manager
down
to
the
last
overseer
considered
the
tariff
as
accepted
and
great
was
their
surprise
in
the
morning
at
this
declaration
of
war
made
with
a
tactical
unity
which
seemed
to
indicate
energetic
leadership
at
five
dansaert
woke
hennebeau
to
inform
him
that
not
a
single
man
had
gone
down
at
the
voreux
the
settlement
of
the
which
he
had
passed
through
was
sleeping
deeply
with
closed
windows
and
doors
and
as
soon
as
the
manager
had
jumped
out
of
bed
his
eyes
still
swollen
with
sleep
he
was
overwhelmed
every
quarter
of
an
hour
messengers
came
in
and
dispatches
fell
on
his
desk
as
thick
as
hail
at
first
he
hoped
that
the
revolt
was
limited
to
the
voreux
but
the
news
became
more
serious
every
minute
there
was
the
mirou
the
crévecoeur
the
madeleine
where
only
the
grooms
had
appeared
the
victoire
and
the
two
best
disciplined
pits
where
the
men
had
been
reduced
by
a
third
alone
numbered
all
its
people
and
seemed
to
be
outside
the
movement
up
to
nine
he
dictated
dispatches
telegraphing
in
all
directions
to
the
prefect
of
lille
to
the
directors
of
the
company
warning
the
authorities
and
asking
for
orders
he
had
sent
négrel
to
go
round
the
neighbouring
pits
to
obtain
precise
information
suddenly
hennebeau
recollected
the
lunch
and
he
was
about
to
send
the
coachman
to
tell
the
grégoires
that
the
party
had
been
put
off
when
a
certain
hesitation
and
lack
of
will
stopped
him
the
man
who
in
a
few
brief
phrases
had
just
made
military
preparations
for
a
field
of
battle
he
went
up
to
madame
hennebeau
whose
hair
had
just
been
done
by
her
lady
maid
in
her
ah
they
are
on
strike
she
said
quietly
when
he
had
told
her
well
what
has
that
to
do
with
us
we
are
not
going
to
leave
off
eating
i
suppose
and
she
was
obstinate
it
was
vain
to
tell
her
that
the
lunch
would
be
disturbed
and
that
the
visit
to
could
not
take
place
she
found
an
answer
to
everything
why
lose
a
lunch
that
was
already
cooking
and
as
to
visiting
the
pit
they
could
give
that
up
afterwards
if
the
walk
was
really
imprudent
besides
she
added
when
the
maid
had
gone
out
you
know
that
i
am
anxious
to
receive
these
good
people
this
marriage
ought
to
affect
you
more
than
the
follies
of
your
men
i
want
to
have
it
do
contradict
me
he
looked
at
her
agitated
by
a
slight
trembling
and
the
hard
firm
face
of
the
man
of
discipline
expressed
the
secret
grief
of
a
wounded
heart
she
had
remained
with
naked
shoulders
already
but
still
imposing
and
desirable
with
the
broad
bust
of
a
ceres
gilded
by
the
autumn
for
a
moment
he
felt
a
brutal
desire
to
seize
her
and
to
roll
his
head
between
the
breasts
she
was
exposing
in
this
warm
room
which
exhibited
the
private
luxury
of
a
sensual
woman
and
had
about
it
an
irritating
perfume
of
musk
but
he
recoiled
for
ten
years
they
had
occupied
separate
rooms
good
he
said
leaving
her
do
not
make
any
alterations
hennebeau
had
been
born
in
the
ardennes
in
his
early
life
he
had
undergone
the
hardships
of
a
poor
boy
thrown
as
an
orphan
on
the
paris
streets
after
having
painfully
followed
the
courses
of
the
école
des
mines
at
the
age
of
he
had
gone
to
the
grand
combe
as
engineer
to
the
mine
three
years
later
he
became
divisional
engineer
in
the
at
the
marles
mines
it
was
there
that
he
married
wedding
by
one
of
those
strokes
of
fortune
which
are
the
rule
among
the
corps
des
mines
the
daughter
of
the
rich
owner
of
a
spinning
factory
at
arras
for
fifteen
years
they
lived
in
the
same
small
provincial
town
and
no
event
broke
the
monotony
of
existence
not
even
the
birth
of
a
child
an
increasing
irritation
detached
madame
hennebeau
who
had
been
brought
up
to
respect
money
and
was
disdainful
of
this
husband
who
gained
a
small
salary
with
such
difficulty
and
who
enabled
her
to
gratify
none
of
the
satisfactions
of
vanity
which
she
had
dreamed
of
at
school
he
was
a
man
of
strict
honesty
who
never
speculated
but
stood
at
his
post
like
a
soldier
the
lack
of
harmony
had
only
increased
aggravated
by
one
of
those
curious
misunderstandings
of
the
flesh
which
freeze
the
most
ardent
he
adored
his
wife
she
had
the
sensuality
of
a
greedy
blonde
and
already
they
slept
apart
ill
at
ease
and
wounded
from
that
time
she
had
a
lover
of
whom
he
was
ignorant
at
last
he
left
the
to
occupy
a
situation
in
an
office
at
paris
with
the
idea
that
she
would
be
grateful
to
him
but
paris
only
completed
their
separation
that
paris
which
she
had
desired
since
her
first
doll
and
where
she
washed
away
her
provincialism
in
a
week
becoming
a
woman
of
fashion
at
once
and
throwing
herself
into
all
the
luxurious
follies
of
the
period
the
ten
years
which
she
spent
there
were
filled
by
a
great
passion
a
public
intrigue
with
a
man
whose
desertion
nearly
killed
her
this
time
the
husband
had
not
been
able
to
keep
his
ignorance
and
after
some
abominable
scenes
he
resigned
himself
disarmed
by
the
quiet
unconsciousness
of
this
woman
who
took
her
happiness
where
she
found
it
it
was
after
the
rupture
and
when
he
saw
that
she
was
ill
with
grief
that
he
had
accepted
the
management
of
the
montsou
mines
still
hoping
also
that
she
would
reform
down
there
in
that
desolate
black
country
the
hennebeaus
since
they
had
lived
at
montsou
returned
to
the
irritated
boredom
of
their
early
married
days
at
first
she
seemed
consoled
by
the
great
quiet
soothed
by
the
flat
monotony
of
the
immense
plain
she
buried
herself
in
it
as
a
woman
who
has
done
with
the
world
she
affected
a
dead
heart
so
detached
from
life
that
she
did
not
even
mind
growing
stout
then
beneath
this
indifference
a
final
fever
declared
itself
the
need
to
live
once
more
and
she
deluded
herself
for
six
months
by
organizing
and
furnishing
to
her
taste
the
little
villa
belonging
to
the
management
she
said
it
was
frightful
and
filled
it
with
upholstery
and
all
sorts
of
artistic
luxuries
which
were
talked
of
as
far
as
lille
now
the
country
exasperated
her
those
stupid
fields
spread
out
to
infinity
those
eternal
black
roads
without
a
tree
swarming
with
a
horrid
population
which
disgusted
and
frightened
her
complaints
of
exile
began
she
accused
her
husband
of
having
sacrificed
her
to
a
salary
of
forty
thousand
francs
a
trifle
which
hardly
sufficed
to
keep
the
house
up
why
could
he
not
imitate
others
demand
a
part
for
himself
obtain
shares
succeed
in
something
at
last
and
she
insisted
with
the
cruelty
of
an
heiress
who
had
brought
her
own
fortune
he
always
restrained
and
taking
refuge
in
the
deceptive
coldness
of
a
man
of
business
was
torn
by
desire
for
this
creature
one
of
those
late
desires
which
are
so
violent
and
which
increase
with
age
he
had
never
possessed
her
as
a
lover
he
was
haunted
by
a
continual
image
to
have
her
once
to
himself
as
she
had
given
herself
to
another
every
morning
he
dreamed
of
winning
her
in
the
evening
then
when
she
looked
at
him
with
her
cold
eyes
and
when
he
felt
that
everything
within
her
denied
itself
to
him
he
even
avoided
touching
her
hand
it
was
a
suffering
without
possible
cure
hidden
beneath
the
stiffness
of
his
attitude
the
suffering
of
a
tender
nature
in
secret
anguish
at
the
lack
of
domestic
happiness
at
the
end
of
six
months
when
the
house
being
definitely
furnished
no
longer
occupied
madame
hennebeau
she
fell
into
the
languor
of
boredom
a
victim
who
was
being
killed
by
exile
and
who
said
that
she
was
glad
to
die
of
it
just
then
paul
négrel
arrived
at
montsou
his
mother
the
widow
of
a
provence
captain
living
at
avignon
on
a
slender
income
had
had
to
content
herself
with
bread
and
water
to
enable
him
to
reach
the
école
polytechnique
he
had
come
out
low
in
rank
and
his
uncle
hennebeau
had
enabled
him
to
leave
by
offering
to
take
him
as
engineer
at
the
voreux
from
that
time
he
was
treated
as
one
of
the
family
he
even
had
his
room
there
his
meals
there
lived
there
and
was
thus
enabled
to
send
to
his
mother
half
his
salary
of
three
thousand
francs
to
disguise
this
kindness
hennebeau
spoke
of
the
embarrassment
to
a
young
man
of
setting
up
a
household
in
one
of
those
little
villas
reserved
for
the
mine
engineers
madame
hennebeau
had
at
once
taken
the
part
of
a
good
aunt
treating
her
nephew
with
familiarity
and
watching
over
his
comfort
during
the
first
months
especially
she
exhibited
an
overwhelming
maternity
with
her
advice
regarding
the
smallest
subjects
but
she
remained
a
woman
however
and
slid
into
personal
confidences
this
lad
so
young
and
so
practical
with
his
unscrupulous
intelligence
professing
a
philosopher
theory
of
love
amused
her
with
the
vivacity
of
the
pessimism
which
had
sharpened
his
thin
face
and
pointed
nose
one
evening
he
naturally
found
himself
in
her
arms
and
she
seemed
to
give
herself
up
out
of
kindness
while
saying
to
him
that
she
had
no
heart
left
and
wished
only
to
be
his
friend
in
fact
she
was
not
jealous
she
joked
him
about
the
putters
whom
he
declared
to
be
abominable
and
she
almost
sulked
because
he
had
no
young
man
pranks
to
narrate
to
her
then
she
was
carried
away
by
the
idea
of
getting
him
married
she
dreamed
of
sacrificing
herself
and
of
finding
a
rich
girl
for
him
their
relations
continued
a
plaything
a
recreation
in
which
she
felt
the
last
tenderness
of
a
lazy
woman
who
had
done
with
the
world
two
years
had
passed
by
one
night
hennebeau
had
a
suspicion
when
he
heard
naked
feet
passing
his
door
but
this
new
adventure
revolted
him
in
his
own
house
between
this
mother
and
this
son
and
besides
on
the
following
day
his
wife
spoke
to
him
about
the
choice
of
cécile
grégoire
which
she
had
made
for
her
nephew
she
occupied
herself
over
this
marriage
with
such
ardour
that
he
blushed
at
his
own
monstrous
imagination
he
only
felt
gratitude
towards
the
young
man
who
since
his
arrival
had
made
the
house
less
melancholy
as
he
came
down
from
the
hennebeau
found
that
paul
who
had
just
returned
was
in
the
vestibule
he
seemed
to
be
quite
amused
by
the
story
of
this
strike
well
asked
his
uncle
well
i
been
round
the
settlements
they
seem
to
be
quite
sensible
in
there
i
think
they
will
first
send
you
a
deputation
but
at
that
moment
madame
hennebeau
voice
called
from
the
first
story
is
that
you
paul
come
up
then
and
tell
me
the
news
how
queer
they
are
to
make
such
a
fuss
these
people
who
are
so
happy
and
the
manager
had
to
renounce
further
information
since
his
wife
had
taken
his
messenger
he
returned
and
sat
before
his
desk
on
which
a
new
packet
of
dispatches
was
placed
at
eleven
the
grégoires
arrived
and
were
astonished
when
hippolyte
the
footman
who
was
placed
as
sentinel
hustled
them
in
after
an
anxious
glance
at
the
two
ends
of
the
road
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
they
were
taken
at
once
into
the
study
where
hennebeau
apologized
for
their
reception
but
the
looked
over
the
street
and
it
was
undesirable
to
seem
to
offer
provocations
what
you
do
know
he
went
on
seeing
their
surprise
grégoire
when
he
heard
that
the
strike
had
at
last
broken
out
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
his
placid
way
bah
it
would
be
nothing
the
people
were
honest
with
a
movement
of
her
chin
madame
grégoire
approved
his
confidence
in
the
everlasting
resignation
of
the
colliers
while
cécile
who
was
very
cheerful
that
day
feeling
that
she
looked
well
in
her
capuchin
cloth
costume
smiled
at
the
word
strike
which
reminded
her
of
visits
to
the
settlements
and
the
distribution
of
charities
madame
hennebeau
now
appeared
in
black
silk
followed
by
négrel
ah
is
it
annoying
she
said
at
the
door
as
if
they
wait
those
men
you
know
that
paul
refuses
to
take
us
to
we
can
stay
here
said
grégoire
obligingly
we
shall
be
quite
pleased
paul
had
contented
himself
with
formally
saluting
cécile
and
her
mother
angry
at
this
lack
of
demonstrativeness
his
aunt
sent
him
with
a
look
to
the
young
girl
and
when
she
heard
them
laughing
together
she
enveloped
them
in
a
maternal
glance
hennebeau
however
finished
reading
his
dispatches
and
prepared
a
few
replies
they
talked
near
him
his
wife
explained
that
she
had
not
done
anything
to
this
study
which
in
fact
retained
its
faded
old
red
paper
its
heavy
mahogany
furniture
its
cardboard
files
scratched
by
use
of
an
hour
passed
and
they
were
about
to
seat
themselves
at
table
when
the
footman
announced
deneulin
he
entered
in
an
excited
way
and
bowed
to
madame
hennebeau
ah
you
here
he
said
seeing
the
grégoires
and
he
quickly
spoke
to
the
manager
it
has
come
then
i
just
heard
of
it
through
my
engineer
with
me
all
the
men
went
down
this
morning
but
the
thing
may
spread
i
not
at
all
at
ease
how
is
it
with
you
he
had
arrived
on
horseback
and
his
anxiety
betrayed
itself
in
his
loud
speech
and
abrupt
gestures
which
made
him
resemble
a
retired
cavalry
officer
hennebeau
was
beginning
to
inform
him
regarding
the
precise
situation
when
hippolyte
opened
the
door
then
he
interrupted
himself
to
say
lunch
with
us
i
will
tell
you
more
at
dessert
yes
as
you
please
replied
deneulin
so
full
of
his
thoughts
that
he
accepted
without
ceremony
he
was
however
conscious
of
his
impoliteness
and
turned
towards
madame
hennebeau
with
apologies
she
was
very
charming
however
when
she
had
had
a
seventh
plate
laid
she
placed
her
guests
madame
grégoire
and
cécile
by
her
husband
then
grégoire
and
deneulin
at
her
own
right
and
left
then
paul
whom
she
put
between
the
young
girl
and
her
father
as
they
attacked
the
she
said
with
a
smile
you
must
excuse
me
i
wanted
to
give
you
oysters
on
monday
you
know
there
was
an
arrival
of
ostend
oysters
at
marchiennes
and
i
meant
to
send
the
cook
with
the
carriage
but
she
was
afraid
of
being
stoned
they
all
interrupted
her
with
a
great
burst
of
gaiety
they
thought
the
story
very
funny
hush
said
hennebeau
vexed
looking
at
the
window
through
which
the
road
could
be
seen
we
need
not
tell
the
whole
country
that
we
have
company
this
morning
well
here
is
a
slice
of
sausage
which
they
sha
have
grégoire
declared
the
laughter
began
again
but
with
greater
restraint
each
guest
made
himself
comfortable
in
this
room
upholstered
with
flemish
tapestry
and
furnished
with
old
oak
chests
the
silver
shone
behind
the
panes
of
the
sideboards
and
there
was
a
large
hanging
lamp
of
red
copper
whose
polished
surfaces
reflected
a
palm
and
an
aspidistra
growing
in
majolica
pots
outside
the
december
day
was
frozen
by
a
keen
wind
but
not
a
breath
of
it
entered
a
warmth
developed
the
delicate
odour
of
the
pineapple
sliced
in
a
crystal
bowl
suppose
we
were
to
draw
the
curtains
proposed
négrel
who
was
amused
at
the
idea
of
frightening
the
grégoires
the
housemaid
who
was
helping
the
footman
treated
this
as
an
order
and
went
and
closed
one
of
the
curtains
this
led
to
interminable
jokes
not
a
glass
or
a
plate
could
be
put
down
without
precaution
every
dish
was
hailed
as
a
waif
escaped
from
the
pillage
in
a
conquered
town
and
behind
this
forced
gaiety
there
was
a
certain
fear
which
betrayed
itself
in
involuntary
glances
towards
the
road
as
though
a
band
of
starvelings
were
watching
the
table
from
outside
after
the
scrambled
eggs
with
truffles
trout
came
on
the
conversation
then
turned
to
the
industrial
crisis
which
had
become
aggravated
during
the
last
eighteen
months
it
was
inevitable
said
deneulin
the
excessive
prosperity
of
recent
years
was
bound
to
bring
us
to
it
think
of
the
enormous
capital
which
has
been
sunk
the
railways
harbours
and
canals
all
the
money
buried
in
the
maddest
speculations
among
us
alone
sugar
works
have
been
set
up
as
if
the
department
could
furnish
three
beetroot
harvests
good
heavens
and
money
is
scarce
and
we
have
to
wait
to
catch
up
the
interest
of
the
expended
millions
so
there
is
a
mortal
congestion
and
a
final
stagnation
of
business
hennebeau
disputed
this
theory
but
he
agreed
that
the
fortunate
years
had
spoilt
the
men
when
i
think
he
exclaimed
that
these
chaps
in
our
pits
used
to
gain
six
francs
a
day
double
what
they
gain
now
and
they
lived
well
too
and
acquired
luxurious
tastes
naturally
it
seems
hard
to
them
to
go
back
to
their
old
frugality
monsieur
grégoire
interrupted
madame
hennebeau
let
me
persuade
you
a
little
more
trout
they
are
delicious
are
they
not
the
manager
went
on
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
it
our
fault
we
too
are
cruelly
struck
since
the
factories
have
closed
one
by
one
we
have
had
a
deuce
of
a
difficulty
in
getting
rid
of
our
stock
and
in
face
of
the
growing
reduction
in
demand
we
have
been
forced
to
lower
our
net
prices
it
is
just
this
that
the
men
wo
understand
there
was
silence
the
footman
presented
roast
partridge
while
the
housemaid
began
to
pour
out
chambertin
for
the
guests
there
has
been
a
famine
in
india
said
deneulin
in
a
low
voice
as
though
he
were
speaking
to
himself
america
by
ceasing
to
order
iron
has
struck
a
heavy
blow
at
our
furnaces
everything
holds
together
a
distant
shock
is
enough
to
disturb
the
world
and
the
empire
which
was
so
proud
of
this
hot
fever
of
industry
he
attacked
his
partridge
wing
then
raising
his
voice
the
worst
is
that
to
lower
the
net
prices
we
ought
logically
to
produce
more
otherwise
the
reduction
bears
on
wages
and
the
worker
is
right
in
saying
that
he
has
to
pay
the
damage
this
confession
the
outcome
of
his
frankness
raised
a
discussion
the
ladies
were
not
at
all
interested
besides
all
were
occupied
with
their
plates
in
the
first
zest
of
appetite
when
the
footman
came
back
he
seemed
about
to
speak
then
he
hesitated
what
is
it
asked
hennebeau
if
there
are
letters
give
them
to
me
i
am
expecting
replies
no
sir
it
is
monsieur
dansaert
who
is
in
the
hall
but
he
wish
to
disturb
you
the
manager
excused
himself
and
had
the
head
captain
brought
in
the
latter
stood
upright
a
few
paces
from
the
table
while
all
turned
to
look
at
him
huge
out
of
breath
with
the
news
he
was
bringing
the
settlements
were
quiet
only
it
had
now
been
decided
to
send
a
deputation
it
would
perhaps
be
there
in
a
few
minutes
very
well
thank
you
said
hennebeau
i
want
a
report
morning
and
evening
you
understand
and
as
soon
as
dansaert
had
gone
they
began
to
joke
again
and
hastened
to
attack
the
russian
salad
declaring
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
if
they
wished
to
finish
it
the
mirth
was
unbounded
when
négrel
having
asked
the
housemaid
for
bread
she
replied
yes
sir
in
a
voice
as
low
and
terrified
as
if
she
had
behind
her
a
troop
ready
for
murder
and
rape
you
may
speak
said
madame
hennebeau
complacently
they
are
not
here
yet
the
manager
who
now
received
a
packet
of
letters
and
dispatches
wished
to
read
one
of
his
letters
aloud
it
was
from
pierron
who
in
respectful
phrases
gave
notice
that
he
was
obliged
to
go
out
on
strike
with
his
comrades
in
order
to
avoid
and
he
added
that
he
had
not
even
been
able
to
avoid
taking
part
in
the
deputation
although
he
blamed
that
step
so
much
for
liberty
of
work
exclaimed
hennebeau
then
they
returned
to
the
strike
and
asked
him
his
opinion
oh
he
replied
we
have
had
them
before
it
will
be
a
week
or
at
most
a
fortnight
of
idleness
as
it
was
last
time
they
will
go
and
wallow
in
the
and
then
when
they
are
hungry
they
will
go
back
to
the
pits
deneulin
shook
his
head
i
not
so
satisfied
this
time
they
appear
to
be
better
organized
have
they
not
a
provident
fund
yes
scarcely
three
thousand
francs
what
do
you
think
they
can
do
with
that
i
suspect
a
man
called
étienne
lantier
of
being
their
leader
he
is
a
good
workman
it
would
vex
me
to
have
to
give
him
his
certificate
back
as
we
did
of
old
to
the
famous
rasseneur
who
still
poisons
the
voreux
with
his
ideas
and
his
beer
no
matter
in
a
week
half
the
men
will
have
gone
down
and
in
a
fortnight
the
ten
thousand
will
be
below
he
was
convinced
his
only
anxiety
was
concerning
his
own
possible
disgrace
should
the
directors
put
the
responsibility
of
the
strike
on
him
for
some
time
he
had
felt
that
he
was
diminishing
in
favour
so
leaving
the
spoonful
of
russian
salad
which
he
had
taken
he
read
over
again
the
dispatches
received
from
paris
endeavouring
to
penetrate
every
word
his
guests
excused
him
the
meal
was
becoming
a
military
lunch
eaten
on
the
field
of
battle
before
the
first
shots
were
fired
the
ladies
then
joined
in
the
conversation
madame
grégoire
expressed
pity
for
the
poor
people
who
would
suffer
from
hunger
and
cécile
was
already
making
plans
for
distributing
gifts
of
bread
and
meat
but
madame
hennebeau
was
astonished
at
hearing
of
the
wretchedness
of
the
montsou
colliers
were
they
not
very
fortunate
people
who
were
lodged
and
warmed
and
cared
for
at
the
expense
of
the
company
in
her
indifference
for
the
herd
she
only
knew
the
lessons
she
had
learnt
and
with
which
she
had
surprised
the
parisians
who
came
on
a
visit
she
believed
them
at
last
and
was
indignant
at
the
ingratitude
of
the
people
négrel
meanwhile
continued
to
frighten
grégoire
cécile
did
not
displease
him
and
he
was
quite
willing
to
marry
her
to
be
agreeable
to
his
aunt
but
he
showed
no
amorous
fever
like
a
youth
of
experience
who
he
said
was
not
easily
carried
away
now
he
professed
to
be
a
republican
which
did
not
prevent
him
from
treating
his
men
with
extreme
severity
or
from
making
fun
of
them
in
the
company
of
the
ladies
nor
have
i
my
uncle
optimism
either
he
continued
i
fear
there
will
be
serious
disturbances
so
i
should
advise
you
monsieur
grégoire
to
lock
up
piolaine
they
may
pillage
you
just
then
still
retaining
the
smile
which
illuminated
his
face
grégoire
was
going
beyond
his
wife
in
paternal
sentiments
with
regard
to
the
miners
pillage
me
he
cried
stupefied
and
why
pillage
me
are
you
not
a
shareholder
in
montsou
you
do
nothing
you
live
on
the
work
of
others
in
fact
you
are
an
infamous
capitalist
and
that
is
enough
you
may
be
sure
that
if
the
revolution
triumphs
it
will
force
you
to
restore
your
fortune
as
stolen
money
at
once
he
lost
his
tranquillity
his
serene
unconsciousness
he
stammered
stolen
money
my
fortune
did
not
my
gain
and
hardly
too
the
sum
originally
invested
have
we
not
run
all
the
risks
of
the
enterprise
and
do
i
today
make
a
bad
use
of
my
income
madame
hennebeau
alarmed
at
seeing
the
mother
and
daughter
also
white
with
fear
hastened
to
intervene
saying
paul
is
joking
my
dear
sir
but
grégoire
was
carried
out
of
himself
as
the
servant
was
passing
round
the
crayfish
he
took
three
of
them
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
and
began
to
break
their
claws
with
his
teeth
ah
i
do
say
but
what
there
are
shareholders
who
abuse
their
position
for
instance
i
have
been
told
that
ministers
have
received
shares
in
montsou
for
services
rendered
to
the
company
it
is
like
a
nobleman
whom
i
will
not
name
a
duke
the
biggest
of
our
shareholders
whose
life
is
a
scandal
of
prodigality
millions
thrown
into
the
street
on
women
feasting
and
useless
luxury
but
we
who
live
quietly
like
good
citizens
as
we
are
who
do
not
speculate
who
are
content
to
live
wholesomely
on
what
we
have
giving
a
part
to
the
poor
come
now
your
men
must
be
mere
brigands
if
they
came
and
stole
a
pin
from
us
négrel
himself
had
to
calm
him
though
amused
at
his
anger
the
crayfish
were
still
going
round
the
little
crackling
sound
of
their
carapaces
could
be
heard
while
the
conversation
turned
to
politics
grégoire
in
spite
of
everything
and
though
still
trembling
called
himself
a
liberal
and
regretted
louis
philippe
as
for
deneulin
he
was
for
a
strong
government
he
declared
that
the
emperor
was
gliding
down
the
slope
of
dangerous
concessions
remember
he
said
it
was
the
nobility
who
made
the
revolution
possible
by
their
complicity
and
taste
for
philosophic
novelties
very
well
the
middle
class
are
playing
the
same
silly
game
with
their
furious
liberalism
their
rage
for
destruction
their
flattery
of
the
people
yes
yes
you
are
sharpening
the
teeth
of
the
monster
that
will
devour
us
it
will
devour
us
rest
assured
the
ladies
bade
him
be
silent
and
tried
to
change
the
conversation
by
asking
him
news
of
his
daughters
lucie
was
at
marchiennes
where
she
was
singing
with
a
friend
jeanne
was
painting
an
old
beggar
head
but
he
said
these
things
in
a
distracted
way
he
constantly
looked
at
the
manager
who
was
absorbed
in
the
reading
of
his
dispatches
and
forgetful
of
his
guests
behind
those
thin
leaves
he
felt
paris
and
the
directors
orders
which
would
decide
the
strike
at
last
he
could
not
help
yielding
to
his
preoccupation
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
suddenly
hennebeau
started
then
turned
off
the
question
with
a
vague
phrase
we
shall
see
no
doubt
you
are
solidly
placed
you
can
wait
deneulin
began
to
think
aloud
but
as
for
me
i
shall
be
done
for
if
the
strike
reaches
vandame
i
shall
have
reinstalled
in
vain
with
a
single
pit
i
can
only
get
along
by
constant
production
ah
i
am
not
in
a
very
pleasant
situation
i
can
assure
you
this
involuntary
confession
seemed
to
strike
hennebeau
he
listened
and
a
plan
formed
within
him
in
case
the
strike
turned
out
badly
why
not
utilize
it
by
letting
things
run
down
until
his
neighbour
was
ruined
and
then
buy
up
his
concession
at
a
low
price
that
would
be
the
surest
way
of
regaining
the
good
graces
of
the
directors
who
for
years
had
dreamed
of
possessing
vandame
if
bothers
you
as
much
as
that
said
he
laughing
why
do
you
give
it
up
to
us
but
deneulin
was
already
regretting
his
complaints
he
exclaimed
never
never
they
were
amused
at
his
vigour
and
had
already
forgotten
the
strike
by
the
time
the
dessert
appeared
an
meringue
was
overwhelmed
with
praise
afterwards
the
ladies
discussed
a
recipe
with
respect
to
the
pineapple
which
was
declared
equally
exquisite
the
grapes
and
pears
completed
their
happy
abandonment
at
the
end
of
this
copious
lunch
all
talked
excitedly
at
the
same
time
while
the
servant
poured
out
rhine
wine
in
place
of
champagne
which
was
looked
upon
as
commonplace
and
the
marriage
of
paul
and
cécile
certainly
made
a
forward
step
in
the
sympathy
produced
by
the
dessert
his
aunt
had
thrown
such
urgent
looks
in
his
direction
that
the
young
man
showed
himself
very
amiable
and
in
his
wheedling
way
reconquered
the
grégoires
who
had
been
cast
down
by
his
stories
of
pillage
for
a
moment
hennebeau
seeing
the
close
understanding
between
his
wife
and
his
nephew
felt
that
abominable
suspicion
again
revive
as
if
in
this
exchange
of
looks
he
had
surprised
a
physical
contact
but
again
the
idea
of
the
marriage
made
here
before
his
face
reassured
him
hippolyte
was
serving
the
coffee
when
the
housemaid
entered
in
a
fright
sir
sir
they
are
here
it
was
the
delegates
doors
banged
a
breath
of
terror
was
passing
through
the
neighbouring
rooms
around
the
table
the
guests
were
looking
at
one
another
with
uneasy
indecision
there
was
silence
then
they
tried
to
resume
their
jokes
they
pretended
to
put
the
rest
of
the
sugar
in
their
pockets
and
talked
of
hiding
the
plate
but
the
manager
remained
grave
and
the
laughter
fell
and
their
voices
sank
to
a
whisper
while
the
heavy
feet
of
the
delegates
who
were
being
shown
in
tramped
over
the
carpet
of
the
next
room
madame
hennebeau
said
to
her
husband
lowering
her
voice
i
hope
you
will
drink
your
coffee
certainly
he
replied
let
them
wait
he
was
nervous
listening
to
every
sound
though
apparently
occupied
with
his
cup
paul
and
cécile
got
up
and
he
made
her
venture
an
eye
to
the
keyhole
they
were
stifling
their
laughter
and
talking
in
a
low
voice
do
you
see
them
yes
i
see
a
big
man
and
two
small
ones
behind
have
they
ugly
faces
not
at
all
they
are
very
nice
suddenly
hennebeau
left
his
chair
saying
the
coffee
was
too
hot
and
he
would
drink
it
afterwards
as
he
went
out
he
put
a
finger
to
his
lips
to
recommend
prudence
they
all
sat
down
again
and
remained
at
table
in
silence
no
longer
daring
to
move
listening
from
afar
with
intent
ears
jarred
by
these
coarse
male
voices
chapter
ii
the
previous
day
at
a
meeting
held
at
rasseneur
étienne
and
some
comrades
had
chosen
the
delegates
who
were
to
proceed
on
the
following
day
to
the
manager
house
when
in
the
evening
maheude
learnt
that
her
man
was
one
of
them
she
was
in
despair
and
asked
him
if
he
wanted
them
to
be
thrown
on
the
street
maheu
himself
had
agreed
with
reluctance
both
of
them
when
the
moment
of
action
came
in
spite
of
the
injustice
of
their
wretchedness
fell
back
on
the
resignation
of
their
race
trembling
before
the
morrow
preferring
still
to
bend
their
backs
to
the
yoke
in
the
management
of
affairs
he
usually
gave
way
to
his
wife
whose
advice
was
sound
this
time
however
he
grew
angry
at
last
all
the
more
so
since
he
secretly
shared
her
fears
just
leave
me
alone
will
you
he
said
going
to
bed
and
turning
his
back
a
fine
thing
to
leave
the
mates
now
i
doing
my
duty
she
went
to
bed
in
her
turn
neither
of
them
spoke
then
after
a
long
silence
she
replied
you
right
go
only
poor
old
man
we
are
done
for
midday
struck
while
they
were
at
lunch
for
the
rendezvous
was
at
one
at
the
avantage
from
which
they
were
to
go
together
to
hennebeau
they
were
eating
potatoes
as
there
was
only
a
small
morsel
of
butter
left
no
one
touched
it
they
would
have
bread
and
butter
in
the
evening
you
know
that
we
reckon
on
you
to
speak
said
étienne
suddenly
to
maheu
the
latter
was
so
overcome
that
he
was
silent
from
emotion
no
no
that
too
much
cried
maheude
i
quite
willing
he
should
go
there
but
i
do
allow
him
to
go
at
the
head
why
him
more
than
any
one
else
then
étienne
with
his
fiery
eloquence
began
to
explain
maheu
was
the
best
worker
in
the
pit
the
most
liked
and
the
most
respected
whose
good
sense
was
always
spoken
of
in
his
mouth
the
miners
claims
would
carry
decisive
weight
at
first
étienne
had
arranged
to
speak
but
he
had
been
at
montsou
for
too
short
a
time
one
who
belonged
to
the
country
would
be
better
listened
to
in
fact
the
comrades
were
confiding
their
interests
to
the
most
worthy
he
could
not
refuse
it
would
be
cowardly
maheude
made
a
gesture
of
despair
go
go
my
man
go
and
be
killed
for
the
others
i
willing
after
all
but
i
could
never
do
it
stammered
maheu
i
should
say
something
stupid
étienne
glad
to
have
persuaded
him
struck
him
on
the
shoulder
say
what
you
feel
and
you
wo
go
wrong
father
bonnemort
whose
legs
were
now
less
swollen
was
listening
with
his
mouth
full
shaking
his
head
there
was
silence
when
potatoes
were
being
eaten
the
children
were
subdued
and
behaved
well
then
having
swallowed
his
mouthful
the
old
man
muttered
slowly
you
can
say
what
you
like
and
it
will
be
all
the
same
as
if
you
said
nothing
ah
i
seen
these
affairs
i
seen
them
forty
years
ago
they
drove
us
out
of
the
manager
house
and
with
sabres
too
now
they
may
receive
you
perhaps
but
they
wo
answer
you
any
more
than
that
wall
lord
they
have
money
why
should
they
care
there
was
silence
again
maheu
and
étienne
rose
and
left
the
family
in
gloom
before
the
empty
plates
on
going
out
they
called
for
pierron
and
levaque
and
then
all
four
went
to
rasseneur
where
the
delegates
from
the
neighbouring
settlements
were
arriving
in
little
groups
when
the
twenty
members
of
the
deputation
had
assembled
there
they
settled
on
the
terms
to
be
opposed
to
the
company
and
then
set
out
for
montsou
the
keen
wind
was
sweeping
the
street
as
they
arrived
it
struck
two
at
first
the
servant
told
them
to
wait
and
shut
the
door
on
them
then
when
he
came
back
he
introduced
them
into
the
and
opened
the
curtains
a
soft
daylight
entered
sifted
through
the
lace
and
the
miners
when
left
alone
in
their
embarrassment
did
not
dare
to
sit
all
of
them
very
clean
dressed
in
cloth
shaven
that
morning
with
their
yellow
hair
and
moustaches
they
twisted
their
caps
between
their
fingers
and
looked
sideways
at
the
furniture
which
was
in
every
variety
of
style
as
a
result
of
the
taste
for
the
henry
ii
louis
xv
chairs
an
italian
cabinet
of
the
seventeenth
century
a
spanish
contador
of
the
fifteenth
century
with
an
serving
as
a
and
ancient
chasuble
trimming
reapplied
to
the
curtains
this
old
gold
and
these
old
silks
with
their
tawny
tones
all
this
luxurious
church
furniture
had
overwhelmed
them
with
respectful
discomfort
the
eastern
carpets
with
their
long
wool
seemed
to
bind
their
feet
but
what
especially
suffocated
them
was
the
heat
heat
like
that
of
a
stove
which
surprised
them
as
they
felt
it
with
cheeks
frozen
from
the
wind
of
the
road
five
minutes
passed
by
and
their
awkwardness
increased
in
the
comfort
of
this
rich
room
so
pleasantly
warm
at
last
hennebeau
entered
buttoned
up
in
a
military
manner
and
wearing
on
his
the
correct
little
bow
of
his
decoration
he
spoke
first
ah
here
you
are
you
are
in
rebellion
it
seems
he
interrupted
himself
to
add
with
polite
stiffness
sit
down
i
desire
nothing
better
than
to
talk
things
over
the
miners
turned
round
looking
for
seats
a
few
of
them
ventured
to
place
themselves
on
chairs
while
the
others
disturbed
by
the
embroidered
silks
preferred
to
remain
standing
there
was
a
period
of
silence
hennebeau
who
had
drawn
his
up
to
the
fireplace
was
rapidly
looking
them
over
and
endeavouring
to
recall
their
faces
he
had
recognized
pierron
who
was
hidden
in
the
last
row
and
his
eyes
rested
on
étienne
who
was
seated
in
front
of
him
well
he
asked
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
he
had
expected
to
hear
the
young
man
speak
and
he
was
so
surprised
to
see
maheu
come
forward
that
he
could
not
avoid
adding
what
you
a
good
workman
who
have
always
been
so
sensible
one
of
the
old
montsou
people
whose
family
has
worked
in
the
mine
since
the
first
stroke
of
the
axe
ah
it
a
pity
i
sorry
that
you
are
at
the
head
of
the
discontented
maheu
listened
with
his
eyes
down
then
he
began
at
first
in
a
low
and
hesitating
voice
it
is
just
because
i
am
a
quiet
man
sir
whom
no
one
has
anything
against
that
my
mates
have
chosen
me
that
ought
to
show
you
that
it
is
just
a
rebellion
of
blusterers
men
who
want
to
create
disorder
we
only
want
justice
we
are
tired
of
starving
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
time
has
come
when
things
ought
to
be
arranged
so
that
we
can
at
least
have
bread
every
day
his
voice
grew
stronger
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
went
on
while
looking
at
the
manager
you
know
quite
well
that
we
can
not
agree
to
your
new
system
they
accuse
us
of
bad
timbering
it
true
we
do
give
the
necessary
time
to
the
work
but
if
we
gave
it
our
day
work
would
be
still
smaller
and
as
it
does
give
us
enough
food
at
present
that
would
mean
the
end
of
everything
the
sweep
of
the
clout
that
would
wipe
off
all
your
men
pay
us
more
and
we
will
timber
better
we
will
give
the
necessary
hours
to
the
timbering
instead
of
putting
all
our
strength
into
the
picking
which
is
the
only
work
that
pays
there
no
other
arrangement
possible
if
the
work
is
to
be
done
it
must
be
paid
for
and
what
have
you
invented
instead
a
thing
which
we
ca
get
into
our
heads
you
see
you
lower
the
price
of
the
tram
and
then
you
pretend
to
make
up
for
it
by
paying
for
all
timbering
separately
if
that
was
true
we
should
be
robbed
all
the
same
for
the
timbering
would
still
take
us
more
time
but
what
makes
us
mad
is
that
it
is
even
true
the
company
compensates
for
nothing
at
all
it
simply
puts
two
centimes
a
tram
into
its
pocket
that
all
yes
yes
that
it
murmured
the
other
deputies
noticing
hennebeau
make
a
violent
movement
as
if
to
interrupt
but
maheu
cut
the
manager
short
now
that
he
had
set
out
his
words
came
by
themselves
at
times
he
listened
to
himself
with
surprise
as
though
a
stranger
were
speaking
within
him
it
was
the
things
amassed
within
his
breast
things
he
did
not
even
know
were
there
and
which
came
out
in
an
expansion
of
his
heart
he
described
the
wretchedness
that
was
common
to
all
of
them
the
hard
toil
the
brutal
life
the
wife
and
little
ones
crying
from
hunger
in
the
house
he
quoted
the
recent
disastrous
payments
the
absurd
fortnightly
wages
eaten
up
by
fines
and
rest
days
and
brought
back
to
their
families
in
tears
was
it
resolved
to
destroy
them
then
sir
he
concluded
we
have
come
to
tell
you
that
if
we
got
to
starve
we
would
rather
starve
doing
nothing
it
will
be
a
little
less
trouble
we
have
left
the
pits
and
we
do
go
down
again
unless
the
company
agrees
to
our
terms
the
company
wants
to
lower
the
price
of
the
tram
and
to
pay
for
the
timbering
separately
we
ask
for
things
to
be
left
as
they
were
and
we
also
ask
for
five
centimes
more
the
tram
now
it
is
for
you
to
see
if
you
are
on
the
side
of
justice
and
work
voices
rose
among
the
miners
that
it
he
has
said
what
we
all
feel
we
only
ask
what
reason
others
without
speaking
showed
their
approval
by
nodding
their
heads
the
luxurious
room
had
disappeared
with
its
gold
and
its
embroideries
its
mysterious
piling
up
of
ancient
things
and
they
no
longer
even
felt
the
carpet
which
they
crushed
beneath
their
heavy
boots
let
me
reply
then
at
last
exclaimed
hennebeau
who
was
growing
angry
first
of
all
it
is
not
true
that
the
company
gains
two
centimes
the
tram
let
us
look
at
the
figures
a
confused
discussion
followed
the
manager
trying
to
divide
them
appealed
to
pierron
who
hid
himself
stammering
levaque
on
the
contrary
was
at
the
head
of
the
more
aggressive
muddling
up
things
and
affirming
facts
of
which
he
was
ignorant
the
loud
murmurs
of
their
voices
were
stifled
beneath
the
hangings
in
the
atmosphere
if
you
all
talk
at
the
same
time
said
hennebeau
we
shall
never
come
to
an
understanding
he
had
regained
his
calmness
the
rough
politeness
without
bitterness
of
an
agent
who
has
received
his
instructions
and
means
that
they
shall
be
respected
from
the
first
word
he
never
took
his
eye
off
étienne
and
manoeuvred
to
draw
the
young
man
out
of
his
obstinate
silence
leaving
the
discussion
about
the
two
centimes
he
suddenly
enlarged
the
question
no
acknowledge
the
truth
you
are
yielding
to
abominable
incitations
it
is
a
plague
which
is
now
blowing
over
the
workers
everywhere
and
corrupting
the
best
oh
i
have
no
need
for
any
one
to
confess
i
can
see
well
that
you
have
been
changed
you
who
used
to
be
so
quiet
is
it
not
so
you
have
been
promised
more
butter
than
bread
and
you
have
been
told
that
now
your
turn
has
come
to
be
masters
in
fact
you
have
been
enrolled
in
that
famous
international
that
army
of
brigands
who
dream
of
destroying
society
then
étienne
interrupted
him
you
are
mistaken
sir
not
a
single
montsou
collier
has
yet
enrolled
but
if
they
are
driven
to
it
all
the
pits
will
enroll
themselves
that
depends
on
the
company
from
that
moment
the
struggle
went
on
between
hennebeau
and
étienne
as
though
the
other
miners
were
no
longer
there
the
company
is
a
providence
for
the
men
and
you
are
wrong
to
threaten
it
this
year
it
has
spent
three
hundred
thousand
francs
in
building
settlements
which
only
return
two
per
cent
and
i
say
nothing
of
the
pensions
which
it
pays
nor
of
the
coals
and
medicines
which
it
gives
you
who
seem
to
be
intelligent
and
who
have
become
in
a
few
months
one
of
our
most
skilful
workmen
would
it
not
be
better
if
you
were
to
spread
these
truths
rather
than
ruin
yourself
by
associating
with
people
of
bad
reputation
yes
i
mean
rasseneur
whom
we
had
to
turn
off
in
order
to
save
our
pits
from
socialistic
corruption
you
are
constantly
seen
with
him
and
it
is
certainly
he
who
has
induced
you
to
form
this
provident
fund
which
we
would
willingly
tolerate
if
it
were
merely
a
means
of
saving
but
which
we
feel
to
be
a
weapon
turned
against
us
a
reserve
fund
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
war
and
in
this
connection
i
ought
to
add
that
the
company
means
to
control
that
fund
étienne
allowed
him
to
continue
fixing
his
eyes
on
him
while
a
slight
nervous
quiver
moved
his
lips
he
smiled
at
the
last
remark
and
simply
replied
then
that
is
a
new
demand
for
until
now
sir
you
have
neglected
to
claim
that
control
unfortunately
we
wish
the
company
to
occupy
itself
less
with
us
and
instead
of
playing
the
part
of
providence
to
be
merely
just
with
us
giving
us
our
due
the
profits
which
it
appropriates
is
it
honest
whenever
a
crisis
comes
to
leave
the
workers
to
die
with
hunger
in
order
to
save
the
dividends
whatever
you
may
say
sir
the
new
system
is
a
disguised
reduction
of
wages
and
that
is
what
we
are
rebelling
against
for
if
the
company
wants
to
economize
it
acts
very
badly
by
only
economizing
on
the
men
ah
there
we
are
cried
hennebeau
i
was
expecting
that
the
accusation
of
starving
the
people
and
living
by
their
sweat
how
can
you
talk
such
folly
you
who
ought
to
know
the
enormous
risks
which
capital
runs
in
industry
in
the
mines
for
example
a
pit
today
costs
from
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
to
two
millions
and
it
is
difficult
enough
to
get
a
moderate
interest
on
the
vast
sum
that
is
thus
swallowed
nearly
half
the
mining
companies
in
france
are
bankrupt
besides
it
is
stupid
to
accuse
those
who
succeed
of
cruelty
when
their
workers
suffer
they
suffer
themselves
can
you
believe
that
the
company
has
not
as
much
to
lose
as
you
have
in
the
present
crisis
it
does
not
govern
wages
it
obeys
competition
under
pain
of
ruin
blame
the
facts
not
the
company
but
you
do
wish
to
hear
you
wish
to
understand
yes
said
the
young
man
we
understand
very
well
that
our
lot
will
never
be
bettered
as
long
as
things
go
on
as
they
are
going
and
that
is
the
reason
why
some
day
or
another
the
workers
will
end
by
arranging
that
things
shall
go
differently
this
sentence
so
moderate
in
form
was
pronounced
in
a
low
voice
but
with
such
conviction
tremulous
in
its
menace
that
a
deep
silence
followed
a
certain
constraint
a
breath
of
fear
passed
through
the
polite
the
other
delegates
though
scarcely
understanding
felt
that
their
comrade
had
been
demanding
their
share
of
this
comfort
and
they
began
to
cast
sidelong
looks
over
the
warm
hangings
the
comfortable
seats
all
this
luxury
of
which
the
least
would
have
bought
them
soup
for
a
month
at
last
hennebeau
who
had
remained
thoughtful
rose
as
a
sign
for
them
to
depart
all
imitated
him
étienne
had
lightly
pushed
elbow
and
the
latter
his
tongue
once
more
thick
and
awkward
again
spoke
then
sir
that
is
all
that
you
reply
we
must
tell
the
others
that
you
reject
our
terms
i
my
good
fellow
exclaimed
the
manager
i
reject
nothing
i
am
paid
just
as
you
are
i
have
no
more
power
in
the
matter
than
the
smallest
of
your
trammers
i
receive
my
orders
and
my
only
duty
is
to
see
that
they
are
executed
i
have
told
you
what
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
but
it
is
not
for
me
to
decide
you
have
brought
me
your
demands
i
will
make
them
known
to
the
directors
then
i
will
tell
you
their
reply
he
spoke
with
the
correct
air
of
a
high
official
avoiding
any
passionate
interest
in
the
matter
with
the
courteous
dryness
of
a
simple
instrument
of
authority
and
the
miners
now
looked
at
him
with
distrust
asking
themselves
what
interest
he
might
have
in
lying
and
what
he
would
get
by
thus
putting
himself
between
them
and
the
real
masters
a
schemer
perhaps
this
man
who
was
paid
like
a
worker
and
who
lived
so
well
étienne
ventured
to
intervene
again
you
see
sir
how
unfortunate
it
is
that
we
can
not
plead
our
cause
in
person
we
could
explain
many
things
and
bring
forward
many
reasons
of
which
you
could
know
nothing
if
we
only
knew
where
we
ought
to
go
hennebeau
was
not
at
all
angry
he
even
smiled
ah
it
gets
complicated
as
soon
as
you
have
no
confidence
in
me
you
will
have
to
go
over
there
the
delegates
had
followed
the
vague
gesture
of
his
hand
toward
one
of
the
windows
where
was
it
over
there
paris
no
doubt
but
they
did
not
know
exactly
it
seemed
to
fall
back
into
a
terrible
distance
in
an
inaccessible
religious
country
where
an
unknown
god
sat
on
his
throne
crouching
down
at
the
far
end
of
his
tabernacle
they
would
never
see
him
they
only
felt
him
as
a
force
far
off
which
weighed
on
the
ten
thousand
colliers
of
montsou
and
when
the
director
spoke
he
had
that
hidden
force
behind
him
delivering
oracles
they
were
overwhelmed
with
discouragement
étienne
himself
signified
by
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
that
it
would
be
best
to
go
while
hennebeau
touched
maheu
arm
in
a
friendly
way
and
asked
after
jeanlin
that
is
a
severe
lesson
now
and
it
is
you
who
defend
bad
timbering
you
must
reflect
my
friends
you
must
realize
that
a
strike
would
be
a
disaster
for
everybody
before
a
week
you
would
die
of
hunger
what
would
you
do
i
count
on
your
good
sense
anyhow
and
i
am
convinced
that
you
will
go
down
on
monday
at
the
latest
they
all
left
going
out
of
the
with
the
tramping
of
a
flock
and
rounded
backs
without
replying
a
word
to
this
hope
of
submission
the
manager
who
accompanied
them
was
obliged
to
continue
the
conversation
the
company
on
the
one
side
had
its
new
tariff
the
workers
on
the
other
their
demand
for
an
increase
of
five
centimes
the
tram
in
order
that
they
might
have
no
illusions
he
felt
he
ought
to
warn
them
that
their
terms
would
certainly
be
rejected
by
the
directors
reflect
before
committing
any
follies
he
repeated
disturbed
at
their
silence
in
the
porch
pierron
bowed
very
low
while
levaque
pretended
to
adjust
his
cap
maheu
was
trying
to
find
something
to
say
before
leaving
when
étienne
again
touched
his
elbow
and
they
all
left
in
the
midst
of
this
threatening
silence
the
door
closed
with
a
loud
bang
when
hennebeau
the
he
found
his
guests
motionless
and
silent
before
the
liqueurs
in
two
words
he
told
his
story
to
deneulin
whose
face
grew
still
more
gloomy
then
as
he
drank
his
cold
coffee
they
tried
to
speak
of
other
things
but
the
grégoires
themselves
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
strike
expressing
their
astonishment
that
no
laws
existed
to
prevent
workmen
from
leaving
their
work
paul
reassured
cécile
stating
that
they
were
expecting
the
police
at
last
madame
hennebeau
called
the
servant
hippolyte
before
we
go
into
the
just
open
the
windows
and
let
in
a
little
air
chapter
iii
a
fortnight
had
passed
and
on
the
monday
of
the
third
week
the
lists
sent
up
to
the
managers
showed
a
fresh
decrease
in
the
number
of
the
miners
who
had
gone
down
it
was
expected
that
on
that
morning
work
would
be
resumed
but
the
obstinacy
of
the
directors
in
not
yielding
exasperated
the
miners
the
voreux
crévecoeur
mirou
and
madeleine
were
not
the
only
pits
resting
at
the
victoire
and
at
only
about
a
quarter
of
the
men
had
gone
down
even
was
affected
the
strike
was
gradually
becoming
general
at
the
voreux
a
heavy
silence
hung
over
the
it
was
a
dead
workshop
these
great
empty
abandoned
yards
where
work
was
sleeping
in
the
grey
december
sky
along
the
high
three
or
four
empty
trams
bore
witness
to
the
mute
sadness
of
things
underneath
between
the
slender
posts
of
the
platforms
the
stock
of
coal
was
diminishing
leaving
the
earth
bare
and
black
while
the
supplies
of
wood
were
mouldering
beneath
the
rain
at
the
quay
on
the
canal
a
barge
was
moored
lying
drowsily
in
the
murky
water
and
on
the
deserted
in
which
the
decomposed
sulphates
smoked
in
spite
of
the
rain
a
melancholy
cart
showed
its
shafts
erect
but
the
buildings
especially
were
growing
torpid
the
with
closed
shutters
the
steeple
in
which
the
rumbling
of
the
no
more
arose
and
the
grown
cold
and
the
giant
chimney
too
large
for
the
occasional
smoke
the
was
only
heated
in
the
morning
the
grooms
sent
down
fodder
for
the
horses
and
the
captains
worked
alone
at
the
bottom
having
become
labourers
again
watching
over
the
damages
that
took
place
in
the
passages
as
soon
as
they
ceased
to
be
repaired
then
after
nine
the
rest
of
the
service
was
carried
on
by
the
ladders
and
above
these
dead
buildings
buried
in
their
garment
of
black
dust
there
was
only
heard
the
escapement
of
the
breathing
with
its
thick
long
breath
all
that
was
left
of
the
life
of
the
pit
which
the
water
would
destroy
if
that
breathing
should
cease
on
the
plain
opposite
the
settlement
of
the
seemed
also
to
be
dead
the
prefect
of
lille
had
come
in
haste
and
the
police
had
tramped
all
the
roads
but
in
face
of
the
calmness
of
the
strikers
prefect
and
police
had
decided
to
go
home
again
never
had
the
settlement
given
so
splendid
an
example
in
the
vast
plain
the
men
to
avoid
going
to
the
slept
all
day
long
the
women
while
dividing
the
coffee
became
reasonable
less
anxious
to
gossip
and
quarrel
and
even
the
troops
of
children
seemed
to
understand
it
all
and
were
so
good
that
they
ran
about
with
naked
feet
smacking
each
other
silently
the
word
of
command
had
been
repeated
and
circulated
from
mouth
to
mouth
they
wished
to
be
sensible
there
was
however
a
continuous
coming
and
going
of
people
in
the
maheus
house
étienne
as
secretary
had
divided
the
three
thousand
francs
of
the
provident
fund
among
the
needy
families
afterwards
from
various
sides
several
hundred
francs
had
arrived
yielded
by
subscriptions
and
collections
but
now
all
their
resources
were
exhausted
the
miners
had
no
more
money
to
keep
up
the
strike
and
hunger
was
there
threatening
them
maigrat
after
having
promised
credit
for
a
fortnight
had
suddenly
altered
his
mind
at
the
end
of
a
week
and
cut
off
provisions
he
usually
took
his
orders
from
the
company
perhaps
the
latter
wished
to
bring
the
matter
to
an
end
by
starving
the
settlements
he
acted
besides
like
a
capricious
tyrant
giving
or
refusing
bread
according
to
the
look
of
the
girl
who
was
sent
by
her
parents
for
provisions
and
he
especially
closed
his
door
spitefully
to
maheude
wishing
to
punish
her
because
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
catherine
to
complete
their
misery
it
was
freezing
very
hard
and
the
women
watched
their
piles
of
coal
diminish
thinking
anxiously
that
they
could
no
longer
renew
them
at
the
pits
now
that
the
men
were
not
going
down
it
was
not
enough
to
die
of
hunger
they
must
also
die
of
cold
among
the
maheus
everything
was
already
running
short
the
levaques
could
still
eat
on
the
strength
of
a
piece
lent
by
bouteloup
as
to
the
pierrons
they
always
had
money
but
in
order
to
appear
as
needy
as
the
others
for
fear
of
loans
they
got
their
supplies
on
credit
from
maigrat
who
would
have
thrown
his
shop
at
pierronne
if
she
had
held
out
her
petticoat
to
him
since
saturday
many
families
had
gone
to
bed
without
supper
and
in
face
of
the
terrible
days
that
were
beginning
not
a
complaint
was
heard
all
obeyed
the
word
of
command
with
quiet
courage
there
was
an
absolute
confidence
in
spite
of
everything
a
religious
faith
the
blind
gift
of
a
population
of
believers
since
an
era
of
justice
had
been
promised
to
them
they
were
willing
to
suffer
for
the
conquest
of
universal
happiness
hunger
exalted
their
heads
never
had
the
low
horizon
opened
a
larger
beyond
to
these
people
in
the
hallucination
of
their
misery
they
saw
again
over
there
when
their
eyes
were
dimmed
by
weakness
the
ideal
city
of
their
dream
but
now
growing
near
and
seeming
to
be
real
with
its
population
of
brothers
its
golden
age
of
labour
and
meals
in
common
nothing
overcame
their
conviction
that
they
were
at
last
entering
it
the
fund
was
exhausted
the
company
would
not
yield
every
day
must
aggravate
the
situation
and
they
preserved
their
hope
and
showed
a
smiling
contempt
for
facts
if
the
earth
opened
beneath
them
a
miracle
would
save
them
this
faith
replaced
bread
and
warmed
their
stomachs
when
the
maheus
and
the
others
had
too
quickly
digested
their
soup
made
with
clear
water
they
thus
rose
into
a
state
of
that
ecstasy
of
a
better
life
which
has
flung
martyrs
to
the
wild
beasts
étienne
was
henceforth
the
unquestioned
leader
in
the
evening
conversations
he
gave
forth
oracles
in
the
degree
to
which
study
had
refined
him
and
made
him
able
to
enter
into
difficult
matters
he
spent
the
nights
reading
and
received
a
large
number
of
letters
he
even
subscribed
to
the
a
belgian
socialist
paper
and
this
journal
the
first
to
enter
the
settlement
gained
for
him
extraordinary
consideration
among
his
mates
his
growing
popularity
excited
him
more
every
day
to
carry
on
an
extensive
correspondence
to
discuss
the
fate
of
the
workers
in
the
four
corners
of
the
province
to
give
advice
to
the
voreux
miners
especially
to
become
a
centre
and
to
feel
the
world
rolling
round
him
continually
swelled
the
vanity
of
the
former
the
pikeman
with
greasy
black
hands
he
was
climbing
a
ladder
he
was
entering
this
execrated
middle
class
with
a
satisfaction
to
his
intelligence
and
comfort
which
he
did
not
confess
to
himself
he
had
only
one
trouble
the
consciousness
of
his
lack
of
education
which
made
him
embarrassed
and
timid
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
gentleman
in
a
if
he
went
on
instructing
himself
devouring
everything
the
lack
of
method
would
render
assimilation
very
slow
and
would
produce
such
confusion
that
at
last
he
would
know
much
more
than
he
could
understand
so
at
certain
hours
of
good
sense
he
experienced
a
restlessness
with
regard
to
his
mission
a
fear
that
he
was
not
the
man
for
the
task
perhaps
it
required
a
lawyer
a
learned
man
able
to
speak
and
act
without
compromising
the
mates
but
an
outcry
soon
restored
his
assurance
no
no
no
lawyers
they
are
all
rascals
they
profit
by
their
knowledge
to
fatten
on
the
people
let
things
turn
out
how
they
will
the
workers
must
manage
their
own
affairs
and
his
dream
of
popular
leadership
again
soothed
him
montsou
at
his
feet
paris
in
the
misty
distance
who
knows
the
elections
some
day
the
tribune
in
a
gorgeous
hall
where
he
could
thunder
against
the
middle
class
in
the
first
speech
pronounced
by
a
workman
in
a
parliament
during
the
last
few
days
étienne
had
been
perplexed
pluchart
wrote
letter
after
letter
offering
to
come
to
montsou
to
quicken
the
zeal
of
the
strikers
it
was
a
question
of
organizing
a
private
meeting
over
which
the
mechanic
would
preside
and
beneath
this
plan
lay
the
idea
of
exploiting
the
strike
to
gain
over
to
the
international
these
miners
who
so
far
had
shown
themselves
suspicious
étienne
feared
a
disturbance
but
he
would
however
have
allowed
pluchart
to
come
if
rasseneur
had
not
violently
blamed
this
proceeding
in
spite
of
his
power
the
young
man
had
to
reckon
with
the
innkeeper
whose
services
were
of
older
date
and
who
had
faithful
followers
among
his
clients
so
he
still
hesitated
not
knowing
what
to
reply
on
this
very
monday
towards
four
a
new
letter
came
from
lille
as
étienne
was
alone
with
maheude
in
the
lower
room
maheu
weary
of
idleness
had
gone
fishing
if
he
had
the
luck
to
catch
a
fine
fish
under
the
sluice
of
the
canal
they
could
sell
it
to
buy
bread
old
bonnemort
and
little
jeanlin
had
just
gone
off
to
try
their
legs
which
were
now
restored
while
the
children
had
departed
with
alzire
who
spent
hours
on
the
collecting
cinders
seated
near
the
miserable
fire
which
they
no
longer
dared
to
keep
up
maheude
with
her
dress
unbuttoned
and
one
breast
hanging
out
of
her
dress
and
falling
to
her
belly
was
suckling
estelle
when
the
young
man
had
folded
the
letter
she
questioned
him
is
the
news
good
are
they
going
to
send
us
any
money
he
shook
his
head
and
she
went
on
i
do
know
what
we
shall
do
this
week
however
we
hold
on
all
the
same
when
one
has
right
on
one
side
do
you
think
it
gives
you
heart
and
one
ends
always
by
being
the
strongest
at
the
present
time
she
was
to
a
reasonable
extent
in
favour
of
the
strike
it
would
have
been
better
to
force
the
company
to
be
just
without
leaving
off
work
but
since
they
had
left
it
they
ought
not
to
go
back
to
it
without
obtaining
justice
on
this
point
she
was
relentless
better
to
die
than
to
show
oneself
in
the
wrong
when
one
was
right
ah
exclaimed
étienne
if
a
fine
old
cholera
was
to
break
out
that
would
free
us
of
all
these
company
exploiters
no
no
she
replied
we
must
not
wish
any
one
dead
that
help
us
at
all
plenty
more
would
spring
up
now
i
only
ask
that
they
should
get
sensible
ideas
and
i
expect
they
will
for
there
are
worthy
people
everywhere
you
know
i
not
at
all
for
your
politics
in
fact
she
always
blamed
his
violent
language
and
thought
him
aggressive
it
was
good
that
they
should
want
their
work
paid
for
at
what
it
was
worth
but
why
occupy
oneself
with
such
things
as
the
bourgeois
and
government
why
mix
oneself
up
with
other
affairs
when
one
would
get
nothing
out
of
it
but
hard
knocks
and
she
kept
her
esteem
for
him
because
he
did
not
get
drunk
and
regularly
paid
his
francs
for
board
and
lodging
when
a
man
behaves
well
one
can
forgive
him
the
rest
étienne
then
talked
about
the
republic
which
would
give
bread
to
everybody
but
maheude
shook
her
head
for
she
remembered
an
awful
year
which
had
left
them
as
bare
as
worms
her
and
her
man
in
their
early
housekeeping
years
she
forgot
herself
in
describing
its
horrors
in
a
mournful
voice
her
eyes
lost
in
space
her
breast
open
while
her
infant
estelle
without
letting
it
go
had
fallen
asleep
on
her
knees
and
étienne
also
absorbed
in
thought
had
his
eyes
fixed
on
this
enormous
breast
of
which
the
soft
whiteness
contrasted
with
the
muddy
yellowish
complexion
of
her
face
not
a
farthing
she
murmured
nothing
to
put
between
one
teeth
and
all
the
pits
stopped
just
the
same
destruction
of
poor
people
as
but
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
they
remained
mute
with
surprise
before
catherine
who
then
came
in
since
her
flight
with
chaval
she
had
not
reappeared
at
the
settlement
her
emotion
was
so
great
that
trembling
and
silent
she
forgot
to
shut
the
door
she
expected
to
find
her
mother
alone
and
the
sight
of
the
young
man
put
out
of
her
head
the
phrases
she
had
prepared
on
the
way
what
on
earth
have
you
come
here
for
cried
maheude
without
even
moving
from
her
chair
i
do
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you
get
along
then
catherine
tried
to
find
words
mother
it
some
coffee
and
sugar
yes
for
the
children
i
been
thinking
of
them
and
done
overtime
she
drew
out
of
her
pockets
a
pound
of
coffee
and
a
pound
of
sugar
and
took
courage
to
place
them
on
the
table
the
strike
at
the
voreux
troubled
her
while
she
was
working
at
and
she
had
only
been
able
to
think
of
this
way
of
helping
her
parents
a
little
under
the
pretext
of
caring
for
the
little
ones
but
her
good
nature
did
not
disarm
her
mother
who
replied
instead
of
bringing
us
sweets
you
would
have
done
better
to
stay
and
earn
bread
for
us
she
overwhelmed
her
with
abuse
relieving
herself
by
throwing
in
her
daughter
face
all
that
she
had
been
saying
against
her
for
the
past
month
to
go
off
with
a
man
to
hang
on
to
him
at
sixteen
when
the
family
was
in
want
only
the
most
degraded
of
unnatural
children
could
do
it
one
could
forgive
a
folly
but
a
mother
never
forgot
a
trick
like
that
there
might
have
been
some
excuse
if
they
had
been
strict
with
her
not
at
all
she
was
as
free
as
air
and
they
only
asked
her
to
come
in
to
sleep
tell
me
what
have
you
got
in
your
skin
at
your
age
catherine
standing
beside
the
table
listened
with
lowered
head
a
quiver
shook
her
thin
girlish
body
and
she
tried
to
reply
in
broken
words
oh
if
it
was
only
me
and
the
amusement
that
i
get
it
him
what
he
wants
i
obliged
to
want
too
are
i
because
you
see
he
the
strongest
how
can
one
tell
how
things
are
going
to
turn
out
anyhow
it
done
and
ca
be
undone
it
may
as
well
be
him
as
another
now
he
have
to
marry
me
she
defended
herself
without
a
struggle
with
the
passive
resignation
of
a
girl
who
has
submitted
to
the
male
at
an
early
age
was
it
not
the
common
lot
she
had
never
dreamed
of
anything
else
violence
behind
the
a
child
at
sixteen
and
then
a
wretched
household
if
her
lover
married
her
and
she
did
not
blush
with
shame
she
only
quivered
like
this
at
being
treated
like
a
slut
before
this
lad
whose
presence
oppressed
her
to
despair
étienne
had
risen
however
and
was
pretending
to
stir
up
the
nearly
extinct
fire
in
order
not
to
interrupt
the
explanation
but
their
looks
met
he
found
her
pale
and
exhausted
pretty
indeed
with
her
clear
eyes
in
the
face
which
had
grown
tanned
and
he
experienced
a
singular
feeling
his
spite
had
vanished
he
simply
desired
that
she
should
be
happy
with
this
man
whom
she
had
preferred
to
him
he
felt
the
need
to
occupy
himself
with
her
still
a
longing
to
go
to
montsou
and
force
the
other
man
to
his
duty
but
she
only
saw
pity
in
his
constant
tenderness
he
must
feel
contempt
for
her
to
gaze
at
her
like
that
then
her
heart
contracted
so
that
she
choked
without
being
able
to
stammer
any
more
words
of
excuse
that
it
you
best
hold
your
tongue
began
the
implacable
maheude
if
you
come
back
to
stay
come
in
else
get
along
with
you
at
once
and
think
yourself
lucky
that
i
not
free
just
now
or
i
should
have
put
my
foot
into
you
somewhere
before
now
as
if
this
threat
had
suddenly
been
realized
catherine
received
a
vigorous
kick
right
behind
so
violent
that
she
was
stupefied
with
surprise
and
pain
it
was
chaval
who
had
leapt
in
through
the
open
door
to
give
her
this
lunge
of
a
vicious
beast
for
a
moment
he
had
watched
her
from
outside
ah
slut
he
yelled
i
followed
you
i
knew
well
enough
you
were
coming
back
here
to
get
him
to
fill
you
and
it
you
that
pay
him
eh
you
pour
coffee
down
him
with
my
money
maheude
and
étienne
were
stupefied
and
did
not
stir
with
a
furious
movement
chaval
chased
catherine
towards
the
door
out
you
go
by
god
and
as
she
took
refuge
in
a
corner
he
turned
on
her
mother
a
nice
business
keeping
watch
while
your
whore
of
a
daughter
is
kicking
her
legs
upstairs
at
last
he
caught
catherine
wrist
shaking
her
and
dragging
her
out
at
the
door
he
again
turned
towards
maheude
who
was
nailed
to
her
chair
she
had
forgotten
to
fasten
up
her
breast
estelle
had
gone
to
sleep
and
her
face
had
slipped
down
into
the
woollen
petticoat
the
enormous
breast
was
hanging
free
and
naked
like
the
udder
of
a
great
cow
when
the
daughter
is
not
at
it
it
the
mother
who
gets
herself
plugged
cried
chaval
go
on
show
him
your
meat
he
disgusted
your
dirty
lodger
at
this
étienne
was
about
to
strike
his
mate
the
fear
of
arousing
the
settlement
by
a
fight
had
kept
him
back
from
snatching
catherine
from
chaval
hands
but
rage
was
now
carrying
him
away
and
the
two
men
were
face
to
face
with
inflamed
eyes
it
was
an
old
hatred
a
jealousy
long
unacknowledged
which
was
breaking
out
one
of
them
now
must
do
for
the
other
take
care
stammered
étienne
with
clenched
teeth
i
do
for
you
try
replied
chaval
they
looked
at
one
another
for
some
seconds
longer
so
close
that
their
hot
breaths
burnt
each
other
faces
and
it
was
catherine
who
suppliantly
took
her
lover
hand
again
to
lead
him
away
she
dragged
him
out
of
the
settlement
fleeing
without
turning
her
head
what
a
brute
muttered
étienne
banging
the
door
and
so
shaken
by
anger
that
he
was
obliged
to
sit
down
maheude
in
front
of
him
had
not
stirred
she
made
a
vague
gesture
and
there
was
silence
a
silence
which
was
painful
and
heavy
with
unspoken
things
in
spite
of
an
effort
his
gaze
again
returned
to
her
breast
that
expanse
of
white
flesh
the
brilliance
of
which
now
made
him
uncomfortable
no
doubt
she
was
forty
and
had
lost
her
shape
like
a
good
female
who
had
produced
too
much
but
many
would
still
desire
her
strong
and
solid
with
the
large
long
face
of
a
woman
who
had
once
been
beautiful
slowly
and
quietly
she
was
putting
back
her
breast
with
both
hands
a
rosy
corner
was
still
obstinate
and
she
pushed
it
back
with
her
finger
and
then
buttoned
herself
up
and
was
now
quite
black
and
shapeless
in
her
old
gown
he
a
filthy
beast
she
said
at
last
only
a
filthy
beast
could
have
such
nasty
ideas
i
do
care
a
hang
what
he
says
it
is
worth
notice
then
in
a
frank
voice
she
added
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
young
man
i
have
my
faults
sure
enough
but
not
that
one
only
two
men
have
touched
me
a
putter
long
ago
when
i
was
fifteen
and
then
maheu
if
he
had
left
me
like
the
other
lord
i
do
quite
know
what
would
have
happened
and
i
do
pride
myself
either
on
my
good
conduct
with
him
since
our
marriage
because
when
one
has
gone
wrong
it
often
because
one
has
the
chance
only
i
say
things
as
they
are
and
i
know
neighbours
who
could
say
as
much
do
you
think
that
true
enough
replied
étienne
and
he
rose
and
went
out
while
she
decided
to
light
the
fire
again
after
having
placed
the
sleeping
estelle
on
two
chairs
if
the
father
caught
and
sold
a
fish
they
could
manage
to
have
some
soup
outside
night
was
already
coming
on
a
frosty
night
and
with
lowered
head
étienne
walked
along
sunk
in
dark
melancholy
it
was
no
longer
anger
against
the
man
or
pity
for
the
poor
girl
the
brutal
scene
was
effaced
and
lost
and
he
was
thrown
back
on
to
the
sufferings
of
all
the
abominations
of
wretchedness
he
thought
of
the
settlement
without
bread
these
women
and
little
ones
who
would
not
eat
that
evening
all
this
struggling
race
with
empty
bellies
and
the
doubt
which
sometimes
touched
him
awoke
again
in
the
frightful
melancholy
of
the
twilight
and
tortured
him
with
a
discomfort
which
he
had
never
felt
so
strongly
before
with
what
a
terrible
responsibility
he
had
burdened
himself
must
he
still
push
them
on
in
obstinate
resistance
now
that
there
was
neither
money
nor
credit
and
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
all
if
no
help
arrived
and
starvation
came
to
beat
down
their
courage
he
had
a
sudden
vision
of
disaster
of
dying
children
and
sobbing
mothers
while
the
men
lean
and
pale
went
down
once
more
into
the
pits
he
went
on
walking
his
feet
stumbling
against
the
stones
and
the
thought
that
the
company
would
be
found
strongest
and
that
he
would
have
brought
misfortune
on
his
comrades
filled
him
with
insupportable
anguish
when
he
raised
his
head
he
saw
that
he
was
in
front
of
the
voreux
the
gloomy
mass
of
buildings
looked
sombre
beneath
the
growing
darkness
the
deserted
square
obstructed
by
great
motionless
shadows
seemed
like
the
corner
of
an
abandoned
fortress
as
soon
as
the
stopped
the
soul
left
the
place
at
this
hour
of
the
night
nothing
was
alive
not
a
lantern
not
a
voice
and
the
sound
of
the
pump
itself
was
only
a
distant
moan
coming
one
could
not
say
whence
in
this
annihilation
of
the
whole
pit
as
étienne
gazed
the
blood
flowed
back
to
his
heart
if
the
workers
were
suffering
hunger
the
company
was
encroaching
on
its
millions
why
should
it
prove
the
stronger
in
this
war
of
labour
against
gold
in
any
case
the
victory
would
cost
it
dear
they
would
have
their
corpses
to
count
he
felt
the
fury
of
battle
again
the
fierce
desire
to
have
done
with
misery
even
at
the
price
of
death
it
would
be
as
well
for
the
settlement
to
die
at
one
stroke
as
to
go
on
dying
in
detail
of
famine
and
injustice
his
reading
came
back
to
him
examples
of
nations
who
had
burnt
their
towns
to
arrest
the
enemy
vague
histories
of
mothers
who
had
saved
their
children
from
slavery
by
crushing
their
heads
against
the
pavement
of
men
who
had
died
of
want
rather
than
eat
the
bread
of
tyrants
his
head
became
exalted
a
red
gaiety
arose
out
of
his
crisis
of
black
sadness
chasing
away
doubt
and
making
him
ashamed
of
this
passing
cowardice
of
an
hour
and
in
this
revival
of
his
faith
gusts
of
pride
reappeared
and
carried
him
still
higher
the
joy
of
being
leader
of
seeing
himself
obeyed
even
to
sacrifice
the
enlarged
dream
of
his
power
the
evening
of
triumph
already
he
imagined
a
scene
of
simple
grandeur
his
refusal
of
power
authority
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
people
when
it
would
be
master
but
he
awoke
and
started
at
the
voice
of
maheu
who
was
narrating
his
luck
a
superb
trout
which
he
had
fished
up
and
sold
for
three
francs
they
would
have
their
soup
then
he
left
his
mate
to
return
alone
to
the
settlement
saying
that
he
would
follow
him
and
he
entered
and
sat
down
in
the
avantage
awaiting
the
departure
of
a
client
to
tell
rasseneur
decisively
that
he
should
write
to
pluchart
to
come
at
once
his
resolution
was
taken
he
would
organize
a
private
meeting
for
victory
seemed
to
him
certain
if
the
montsou
colliers
adhered
in
a
mass
to
the
international
chapter
iv
it
was
at
the
widow
désir
that
the
private
meeting
was
organized
for
thursday
at
two
the
widow
incensed
at
the
miseries
inflicted
on
her
children
the
colliers
was
in
a
constant
state
of
anger
especially
as
her
inn
was
emptying
never
had
there
been
a
less
thirsty
strike
the
drunkards
had
shut
themselves
up
at
home
for
fear
of
disobeying
the
sober
word
of
command
thus
montsou
which
swarmed
with
people
on
now
exhibited
its
wide
street
in
mute
and
melancholy
desolation
no
beer
flowed
from
counters
or
bellies
the
gutters
were
dry
on
the
pavement
at
the
casimir
bar
and
the
estaminet
du
progrés
one
only
saw
the
pale
faces
of
the
landladies
looking
inquiringly
into
the
street
then
in
montsou
itself
the
deserted
doors
extended
from
the
estaminet
lenfant
to
the
estaminet
tison
passing
by
the
estaminet
piquette
and
the
bar
only
the
estaminet
which
was
frequented
by
captains
still
drew
occasional
glasses
the
solitude
even
extended
to
the
volcan
where
the
ladies
were
resting
for
lack
of
admirers
although
they
had
lowered
their
price
from
ten
sous
to
five
in
view
of
the
hard
times
a
deep
mourning
was
breaking
the
heart
of
the
entire
country
by
god
exclaimed
widow
désir
slapping
her
thighs
with
both
hands
it
the
fault
of
the
gendarmes
let
them
run
me
in
devil
take
them
if
they
like
but
i
must
plague
them
for
her
all
authorities
and
masters
were
gendarmes
it
was
a
term
of
general
contempt
in
which
she
enveloped
all
the
enemies
of
the
people
she
had
greeted
étienne
request
with
transport
her
whole
house
belonged
to
the
miners
she
would
lend
her
gratuitously
and
would
herself
issue
the
invitations
since
the
law
required
it
besides
if
the
law
was
not
pleased
so
much
the
better
she
would
give
them
a
bit
of
her
mind
since
yesterday
the
young
man
had
brought
her
some
fifty
letters
to
sign
he
had
them
copied
by
neighbours
in
the
settlement
who
knew
how
to
write
and
these
letters
were
sent
around
among
the
pits
to
delegates
and
to
men
of
whom
they
were
sure
the
avowed
order
of
the
day
was
a
discussion
regarding
the
continuation
of
the
strike
but
in
reality
they
were
expecting
pluchart
and
reckoning
on
a
discourse
from
him
which
would
cause
a
general
adhesion
to
the
international
on
thursday
morning
étienne
was
disquieted
by
the
of
his
old
foreman
who
had
promised
by
letter
to
arrive
on
wednesday
evening
what
then
was
happening
he
was
annoyed
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
before
the
meeting
at
nine
he
went
to
montsou
with
the
idea
that
the
mechanic
had
perhaps
gone
there
direct
without
stopping
at
the
voreux
no
i
not
seen
your
friend
replied
widow
désir
but
everything
is
ready
come
and
see
she
led
him
into
the
the
decorations
were
the
same
the
garlands
which
supported
at
the
ceiling
a
crown
of
painted
paper
flowers
and
the
gilt
cardboard
shields
in
a
line
along
the
wall
with
the
names
of
saints
male
and
female
only
the
musicians
platform
had
been
replaced
by
a
table
and
three
chairs
in
one
corner
and
the
room
was
furnished
with
forms
ranged
along
the
floor
it
perfect
étienne
declared
and
you
know
said
the
widow
that
you
at
home
here
yell
as
much
as
you
like
the
gendarmes
will
have
to
pass
over
my
body
if
they
do
come
in
spite
of
his
anxiety
he
could
not
help
smiling
when
he
looked
at
her
so
vast
did
she
appear
with
a
pair
of
breasts
so
huge
that
one
alone
would
require
a
man
to
embrace
it
which
now
led
to
the
saying
that
of
her
six
weekday
lovers
she
had
to
take
two
every
evening
on
account
of
the
work
but
étienne
was
astonished
to
see
rasseneur
and
souvarine
enter
and
as
the
widow
left
them
all
three
in
the
large
empty
hall
he
exclaimed
what
you
here
already
souvarine
who
had
worked
all
night
at
the
voreux
the
not
being
on
strike
had
merely
come
out
of
curiosity
as
to
rasseneur
he
had
seemed
constrained
during
the
last
two
days
and
his
fat
round
face
had
lost
its
laugh
pluchart
has
not
arrived
and
i
am
very
anxious
added
étienne
the
innkeeper
turned
away
his
eyes
and
replied
between
his
teeth
i
not
surprised
i
do
expect
him
what
then
he
made
up
his
mind
and
looking
the
other
man
in
the
face
bravely
i
too
have
sent
him
a
letter
if
you
want
me
to
tell
you
and
in
that
letter
i
have
begged
him
not
to
come
yes
i
think
we
ought
to
manage
our
own
affairs
ourselves
without
turning
to
strangers
étienne
losing
his
and
trembling
with
anger
turned
his
eyes
on
his
mate
and
stammered
you
done
that
you
done
that
i
have
done
that
certainly
and
you
know
that
i
trust
pluchart
a
knowing
fellow
and
reliable
one
can
get
on
with
him
but
you
see
i
do
care
a
damn
for
your
ideas
i
do
politics
government
and
all
that
i
do
care
a
damn
for
it
what
i
want
is
for
the
miner
to
be
better
treated
i
have
worked
down
below
for
twenty
years
sweated
down
there
with
fatigue
and
misery
and
i
sworn
to
make
it
easier
for
the
poor
beggars
who
are
there
still
and
i
know
well
enough
you
never
get
anything
with
all
your
ideas
you
only
make
the
men
fate
more
miserable
still
when
they
are
forced
by
hunger
to
go
down
again
they
will
be
more
crushed
than
ever
the
company
will
pay
them
with
strokes
of
the
stick
like
a
runaway
dog
who
is
brought
back
to
his
kennel
that
what
i
want
to
prevent
do
you
see
he
raised
his
voice
protruding
his
belly
and
squarely
planted
on
his
big
legs
the
man
whole
patient
reasonable
nature
was
revealed
in
clear
phrases
which
flowed
abundantly
without
an
effort
was
it
not
absurd
to
believe
that
with
one
stroke
one
could
change
the
world
putting
the
workers
in
the
place
of
the
masters
and
dividing
gold
as
one
divides
an
apple
it
would
perhaps
take
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
for
that
to
be
realized
there
hold
your
tongue
with
your
miracles
the
most
sensible
plan
was
if
one
did
not
wish
to
break
one
nose
to
go
straight
forward
to
demand
possible
reforms
in
short
to
improve
the
lot
of
the
workers
on
every
occasion
he
did
his
best
so
far
as
he
occupied
himself
with
it
to
bring
the
company
to
better
terms
if
not
damn
it
all
they
would
only
starve
by
being
obstinate
étienne
had
let
him
speak
his
own
speech
cut
short
by
indignation
then
he
cried
have
you
got
any
blood
in
your
veins
by
god
at
one
moment
he
would
have
struck
him
and
to
resist
the
temptation
he
rushed
about
the
hall
with
long
strides
venting
his
fury
on
the
benches
through
which
he
made
a
passage
shut
the
door
at
all
events
souvarine
remarked
there
is
no
need
to
be
heard
having
himself
gone
to
shut
it
he
quietly
sat
down
in
one
of
the
office
chairs
he
had
rolled
a
cigarette
and
was
looking
at
the
other
two
men
with
his
mild
subtle
eye
his
lips
drawn
by
a
slight
smile
you
wo
get
any
farther
by
being
angry
said
rasseneur
judiciously
i
believed
at
first
that
you
had
good
sense
it
was
sensible
to
recommend
calmness
to
the
mates
to
force
them
to
keep
indoors
and
to
use
your
power
to
maintain
order
and
now
you
want
to
get
them
into
a
mess
at
each
turn
in
his
walks
among
the
benches
étienne
returned
towards
the
innkeeper
seizing
him
by
the
shoulders
shaking
him
and
shouting
out
his
replies
in
his
face
but
blast
it
all
i
mean
to
be
calm
yes
i
have
imposed
order
on
them
yes
i
do
advise
them
still
not
to
stir
only
it
does
do
to
be
made
a
joke
of
after
all
you
are
lucky
to
remain
cool
now
there
are
hours
when
i
feel
that
i
am
losing
my
head
this
was
a
confession
on
his
part
he
railed
at
his
illusions
of
a
novice
his
religious
dream
of
a
city
in
which
justice
would
soon
reign
among
the
men
who
had
become
brothers
a
fine
method
truly
to
cross
one
arms
and
wait
if
one
wished
to
see
men
eating
each
other
to
the
end
of
the
world
like
wolves
no
one
must
interfere
or
injustice
would
be
eternal
and
the
rich
would
for
ever
suck
the
blood
of
the
poor
therefore
he
could
not
forgive
himself
the
stupidity
of
having
said
formerly
that
politics
ought
to
be
banished
from
the
social
question
he
knew
nothing
then
now
he
had
read
and
studied
his
ideas
were
ripe
and
he
boasted
that
he
had
a
system
he
explained
it
badly
however
in
confused
phrases
which
contained
a
little
of
all
the
theories
he
had
successively
passed
through
and
abandoned
at
the
summit
karl
marx
idea
remained
standing
capital
was
the
result
of
spoliation
it
was
the
duty
and
the
privilege
of
labour
to
reconquer
that
stolen
wealth
in
practice
he
had
at
first
with
proudhon
been
captured
by
the
chimera
of
a
mutual
credit
a
vast
bank
of
exchange
which
suppressed
middlemen
then
lassalle
cooperative
societies
endowed
by
the
state
gradually
transforming
the
earth
into
a
single
industrial
town
had
aroused
his
enthusiasm
until
he
grew
disgusted
in
face
of
the
difficulty
of
controlling
them
and
he
had
arrived
recently
at
collectivism
demanding
that
all
the
instruments
of
production
should
be
restored
to
the
community
but
this
remained
vague
he
knew
not
how
to
realize
this
new
dream
still
hindered
by
scruples
of
reason
and
good
sense
not
daring
to
risk
the
absolute
affirmations
he
simply
said
that
it
was
a
question
of
getting
possession
of
the
government
first
of
all
afterwards
they
would
see
but
what
has
taken
you
why
are
you
going
over
to
the
bourgeois
he
continued
violently
again
planting
himself
before
the
innkeeper
you
said
yourself
it
would
have
to
burst
up
rasseneur
blushed
slightly
yes
i
said
so
and
if
it
does
burst
up
you
will
see
that
i
am
no
more
of
a
coward
than
any
one
else
only
i
refuse
to
be
among
those
who
increase
the
mess
in
order
to
fish
out
a
position
for
themselves
étienne
blushed
in
his
turn
the
two
men
no
longer
shouted
having
become
bitter
and
spiteful
conquered
by
the
coldness
of
their
rivalry
it
was
at
bottom
that
which
always
strains
systems
making
one
man
revolutionary
in
the
extreme
pushing
the
other
to
an
affectation
of
prudence
carrying
them
in
spite
of
themselves
beyond
their
true
ideas
into
those
fatal
parts
which
men
do
not
choose
for
themselves
and
souvarine
who
was
listening
exhibited
on
his
pale
girlish
face
a
silent
contempt
the
crushing
contempt
of
the
man
who
was
willing
to
yield
his
life
in
obscurity
without
even
gaining
the
splendour
of
martyrdom
then
it
to
me
that
you
saying
that
asked
étienne
jealous
jealous
of
what
replied
rasseneur
i
do
pose
as
a
big
man
not
trying
to
create
a
section
at
montsou
for
the
sake
of
being
made
secretary
the
other
man
wanted
to
interrupt
him
but
he
added
why
do
you
be
frank
you
do
care
a
damn
for
the
international
you
only
burning
to
be
at
our
head
the
gentleman
who
corresponds
with
the
famous
federal
council
of
the
nord
there
was
silence
étienne
replied
quivering
good
i
do
think
i
have
anything
to
reproach
myself
with
i
always
asked
your
advice
for
i
knew
that
you
had
fought
here
long
before
me
but
since
you
ca
endure
any
one
by
your
side
i
act
alone
in
future
and
first
i
warn
you
that
the
meeting
will
take
place
even
if
pluchart
does
not
come
and
the
mates
will
join
in
spite
of
you
oh
join
muttered
the
innkeeper
that
not
enough
you
have
to
get
them
to
pay
their
subscriptions
not
at
all
the
international
grants
time
to
workers
on
strike
it
will
at
once
come
to
our
help
and
we
shall
pay
later
on
rasseneur
was
carried
beyond
himself
well
we
shall
see
i
belong
to
this
meeting
of
yours
and
i
shall
speak
i
shall
not
let
you
turn
our
friends
heads
i
shall
let
them
know
where
their
real
interests
lie
we
shall
see
whom
they
mean
to
follow
me
whom
they
have
known
for
thirty
years
or
you
who
have
turned
everything
upside
down
among
us
in
less
than
a
year
no
no
damn
it
all
we
shall
see
which
of
us
is
going
to
crush
the
other
and
he
went
out
banging
the
door
the
garlands
of
flowers
swayed
from
the
ceiling
and
the
gilt
shields
jumped
against
the
walls
then
the
great
room
fell
back
into
its
heavy
calm
souvarine
was
smoking
in
his
quiet
way
seated
before
the
table
after
having
paced
for
a
moment
in
silence
étienne
began
to
relieve
his
feelings
at
length
was
it
his
fault
if
they
had
left
that
fat
lazy
fellow
to
come
to
him
and
he
defended
himself
from
having
ought
popularity
he
knew
not
even
how
it
had
happened
this
friendliness
of
the
settlement
the
confidence
of
the
miners
the
power
which
he
now
had
over
them
he
was
indignant
at
being
accused
of
wishing
to
bring
everything
to
confusion
out
of
ambition
he
struck
his
chest
protesting
his
brotherly
feelings
suddenly
he
stopped
before
souvarine
and
exclaimed
do
you
know
if
i
thought
i
should
cost
a
drop
of
blood
to
a
friend
i
would
go
off
at
once
to
america
the
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
a
smile
again
came
on
his
lips
oh
blood
he
murmured
what
does
that
matter
the
earth
has
need
of
it
étienne
growing
calm
took
a
chair
and
put
his
elbows
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
this
fair
face
with
the
dreamy
eyes
which
sometimes
grew
savage
with
a
red
light
disturbed
him
and
exercised
a
singular
power
over
his
will
in
spite
of
his
comrade
silence
conquered
even
by
that
silence
he
felt
himself
gradually
absorbed
well
he
asked
what
would
you
do
in
my
place
am
i
not
right
to
act
as
i
do
is
it
best
for
us
to
join
this
association
souvarine
after
having
slowly
ejected
a
jet
of
smoke
replied
by
his
favourite
word
oh
foolery
but
meanwhile
it
always
so
besides
their
international
will
soon
begin
to
move
he
has
taken
it
up
who
then
he
he
had
pronounced
this
word
in
a
whisper
with
religious
fervour
casting
a
glance
towards
the
east
he
was
speaking
of
the
master
bakunin
the
destroyer
he
alone
can
give
the
thunderclap
he
went
on
while
your
learned
men
with
their
evolution
are
mere
cowards
before
three
years
are
past
the
international
under
his
orders
will
crush
the
old
world
étienne
pricked
up
his
ears
in
attention
he
was
burning
to
gain
knowledge
to
understand
this
worship
of
destruction
regarding
which
the
only
uttered
occasional
obscure
words
as
though
he
kept
certain
mysteries
to
himself
well
but
explain
to
me
what
is
your
aim
to
destroy
everything
no
more
nations
no
more
governments
no
more
property
no
more
god
nor
worship
i
quite
understand
only
what
will
that
lead
you
to
to
the
primitive
formless
commune
to
a
new
world
to
the
renewal
of
everything
and
the
means
of
execution
how
do
you
reckon
to
set
about
it
by
fire
by
poison
by
the
dagger
the
brigand
is
the
true
hero
the
popular
avenger
the
revolutionary
in
action
with
no
phrases
drawn
out
of
books
we
need
a
series
of
tremendous
outrages
to
frighten
the
powerful
and
to
arouse
the
people
as
he
talked
souvarine
grew
terrible
an
ecstasy
raised
him
on
his
chair
a
mystic
flame
darted
from
his
pale
eyes
and
his
delicate
hands
gripped
the
edge
of
the
table
almost
to
breaking
the
other
man
looked
at
him
in
fear
and
thought
of
the
stories
of
which
he
had
received
vague
intimation
of
mines
charged
beneath
the
tsar
palace
of
chiefs
of
police
struck
down
by
knives
like
wild
boars
of
his
mistress
the
only
woman
he
had
loved
hanged
at
moscow
one
rainy
morning
while
in
the
crowd
he
kissed
her
with
his
eyes
for
the
last
time
no
no
murmured
étienne
as
with
a
gesture
he
pushed
away
these
abominable
visions
we
have
got
to
that
yet
over
here
murder
and
fire
never
it
is
monstrous
unjust
all
the
mates
would
rise
and
strangle
the
guilty
one
and
besides
he
could
not
understand
the
instincts
of
his
race
refused
to
accept
this
sombre
dream
of
the
extermination
of
the
world
mown
level
like
a
then
what
would
they
do
afterwards
how
would
the
nations
spring
up
again
he
demanded
a
reply
tell
me
your
programme
we
like
to
know
where
we
are
going
to
then
souvarine
concluded
peacefully
with
his
gaze
fixed
on
space
all
reasoning
about
the
future
is
criminal
because
it
prevents
pure
destruction
and
interferes
with
the
progress
of
revolution
this
made
étienne
laugh
in
spite
of
the
cold
shiver
which
passed
over
his
flesh
besides
he
willingly
acknowledged
that
there
was
something
in
these
ideas
which
attracted
him
by
their
fearful
simplicity
only
it
would
be
playing
into
rasseneur
hands
if
he
were
to
repeat
such
things
to
his
comrades
it
was
necessary
to
be
practical
widow
désir
proposed
that
they
should
have
lunch
they
agreed
and
went
into
the
inn
parlour
which
was
separated
from
the
on
weekdays
by
a
movable
partition
when
they
had
finished
their
omelette
and
cheese
the
proposed
to
depart
and
as
the
other
tried
to
detain
him
what
for
to
listen
to
you
talking
useless
foolery
i
seen
enough
of
it
good
day
he
went
off
in
his
gentle
obstinate
way
with
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
étienne
anxiety
increased
it
was
one
and
pluchart
was
decidedly
breaking
his
promise
towards
one
the
delegates
began
to
appear
and
he
had
to
receive
them
for
he
wished
to
see
who
entered
for
fear
that
the
company
might
send
its
usual
spies
he
examined
every
letter
of
invitation
and
took
note
of
those
who
entered
many
came
in
without
a
letter
as
they
were
admitted
provided
he
knew
them
as
two
struck
rasseneur
entered
finishing
his
pipe
at
the
counter
and
chatting
without
haste
this
provoking
calmness
still
further
disturbed
étienne
all
the
more
as
many
had
come
merely
for
fun
zacharie
mouquet
and
others
these
cared
little
about
the
strike
and
found
it
a
great
joke
to
do
nothing
seated
at
tables
and
spending
their
last
two
sous
on
drink
they
grinned
and
bantered
their
mates
the
serious
ones
who
had
come
to
make
fools
of
themselves
another
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
there
was
impatience
in
the
hall
then
étienne
in
despair
made
a
gesture
of
resolution
and
he
decided
to
enter
when
widow
désir
who
was
putting
her
head
outside
exclaimed
but
here
he
is
your
gentleman
it
was
in
fact
pluchart
he
came
in
a
cab
drawn
by
a
horse
he
jumped
at
once
on
to
the
pavement
a
thin
insipidly
handsome
man
with
a
large
square
head
in
his
black
cloth
he
had
the
sunday
air
of
a
workman
for
five
years
he
had
not
done
a
stroke
with
the
file
and
he
took
care
of
his
appearance
especially
combing
his
hair
in
a
correct
manner
vain
of
his
successes
on
the
platform
but
his
limbs
were
still
stiff
and
the
nails
of
his
large
hands
eaten
by
the
iron
had
not
grown
again
very
active
he
worked
out
his
ambitions
scouring
the
province
unceasingly
in
order
to
place
his
ideas
ah
do
be
angry
with
me
he
said
anticipating
questions
and
reproaches
yesterday
lecture
at
preuilly
in
the
morning
meeting
in
the
evening
at
valencay
today
lunch
at
marchiennes
with
sauvagnat
then
i
had
to
take
a
cab
i
worn
out
you
can
tell
by
my
voice
but
that
nothing
i
shall
speak
all
the
same
he
was
on
the
threshold
of
the
when
he
bethought
himself
by
jingo
i
forgetting
the
tickets
we
should
have
been
in
a
fine
fix
he
went
back
to
the
cab
which
the
cabman
drew
up
again
and
he
pulled
out
a
little
black
wooden
box
which
he
carried
off
under
his
arm
étienne
walked
radiantly
in
his
shadow
while
rasseneur
in
consternation
did
not
dare
to
offer
his
hand
but
the
other
was
already
pressing
it
and
saying
a
rapid
word
or
two
about
the
letter
what
a
rum
idea
why
not
hold
this
meeting
one
should
always
hold
a
meeting
when
possible
widow
désir
asked
if
he
would
take
anything
but
he
refused
no
need
he
spoke
without
drinking
only
he
was
in
a
hurry
because
in
the
evening
he
reckoned
on
pushing
as
far
as
joiselle
where
he
wished
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
legoujeux
then
they
all
entered
the
together
maheu
and
levaque
who
had
arrived
late
followed
them
the
door
was
then
locked
in
order
to
be
in
privacy
this
made
the
jokers
laugh
even
more
zacharie
shouting
to
mouquet
that
perhaps
they
were
going
to
get
them
all
with
child
in
there
about
a
hundred
miners
were
waiting
on
the
benches
in
the
close
air
of
the
room
with
the
warm
odours
of
the
last
ball
rising
from
the
floor
whispers
ran
round
and
all
heads
turned
while
the
sat
down
in
the
empty
places
they
gazed
at
the
lille
gentleman
and
the
black
caused
a
certain
surprise
and
discomfort
but
on
étienne
proposition
the
meeting
was
at
once
constituted
he
gave
out
the
names
while
the
others
approved
by
lifting
their
hands
pluchart
was
nominated
chairman
and
maheu
and
étienne
himself
were
voted
stewards
there
was
a
movement
of
chairs
and
the
officers
were
installed
for
a
moment
they
watched
the
chairman
disappear
beneath
the
table
under
which
he
slid
the
box
which
he
had
not
let
go
when
he
reappeared
he
struck
lightly
with
his
fist
to
call
for
attention
then
he
began
in
a
hoarse
voice
citizens
a
little
door
opened
and
he
had
to
stop
it
was
widow
désir
who
coming
round
by
the
kitchen
brought
in
six
glasses
on
a
tray
do
put
yourselves
out
she
said
when
one
talks
one
gets
thirsty
maheu
relieved
her
of
the
tray
and
pluchart
was
able
to
go
on
he
said
how
very
touched
he
was
at
his
reception
by
the
montsou
workers
he
excused
himself
for
his
delay
mentioning
his
fatigue
and
his
sore
throat
then
he
gave
place
to
citizen
rasseneur
who
wished
to
speak
rasseneur
had
already
planted
himself
beside
the
table
near
the
glasses
the
back
of
a
chair
served
him
as
a
rostrum
he
seemed
very
moved
and
coughed
before
starting
in
a
loud
voice
mates
what
gave
him
his
influence
over
the
workers
at
the
pit
was
the
facility
of
his
speech
the
way
in
which
he
could
go
on
talking
to
them
by
the
hour
without
ever
growing
weary
he
never
ventured
to
gesticulate
but
stood
stolid
and
smiling
drowning
them
and
dazing
them
until
they
all
shouted
yes
yes
that
true
enough
you
right
however
on
this
day
from
the
first
word
he
felt
that
there
was
a
sullen
opposition
this
made
him
advance
prudently
he
only
discussed
the
continuation
of
the
strike
and
waited
for
applause
before
attacking
the
international
certainly
honour
prevented
them
from
yielding
to
the
company
demands
but
how
much
misery
what
a
terrible
future
if
it
was
necessary
to
persist
much
longer
and
without
declaring
for
submission
he
damped
their
courage
he
showed
them
the
settlements
dying
of
hunger
he
asked
on
what
resources
the
partisans
of
resistance
were
counting
three
or
four
friends
tried
to
applaud
him
but
this
accentuated
the
cold
silence
of
the
majority
and
the
gradually
rising
disapprobation
which
greeted
his
phrases
then
despairing
of
winning
them
over
he
was
carried
away
by
anger
he
foretold
misfortune
if
they
allowed
their
heads
to
be
turned
at
the
instigation
of
strangers
of
the
audience
had
risen
indignantly
trying
to
silence
him
since
he
insulted
them
by
treating
them
like
children
unable
to
act
for
themselves
but
he
went
on
speaking
in
spite
of
the
tumult
taking
repeated
gulps
of
beer
and
shouting
violently
that
the
man
was
not
born
who
would
prevent
him
from
doing
his
duty
pluchart
had
risen
as
he
had
no
bell
he
struck
his
fist
on
the
table
repeating
in
his
hoarse
voice
citizens
citizens
at
last
he
obtained
a
little
quiet
and
the
meeting
when
consulted
brought
rasseneur
speech
to
an
end
the
delegates
who
had
represented
the
pits
in
the
interview
with
the
manager
led
the
others
all
enraged
by
starvation
and
agitated
by
new
ideas
the
voting
was
decided
in
advance
you
do
care
a
damn
you
do
you
can
eat
yelled
levaque
thrusting
out
his
fist
at
rasseneur
étienne
leaned
over
behind
the
chairman
back
to
appease
maheu
who
was
very
red
and
carried
out
of
himself
by
this
hypocritical
discourse
citizens
said
pluchart
allow
me
to
speak
there
was
deep
silence
he
spoke
his
voice
sounded
painful
and
hoarse
but
he
was
used
to
it
on
his
journeys
and
took
his
laryngitis
about
with
him
like
his
programme
gradually
his
voice
expanded
and
he
produced
pathetic
effects
with
it
with
open
arms
and
accompanying
his
periods
with
a
swaying
of
his
shoulders
he
had
an
eloquence
which
recalled
the
pulpit
a
religious
fashion
of
sinking
the
ends
of
his
sentences
whose
monotonous
roll
at
last
carried
conviction
his
discourse
centred
on
the
greatness
and
the
advantages
of
the
international
it
was
that
with
which
he
always
started
in
every
new
locality
he
explained
its
aim
the
emancipation
of
the
workers
he
showed
its
imposing
structure
below
the
commune
higher
the
province
still
higher
the
nation
and
at
the
summit
humanity
his
arms
moved
slowly
piling
up
the
stages
preparing
the
immense
cathedral
of
the
future
world
then
there
was
the
internal
administration
he
read
the
statutes
spoke
of
the
congresses
pointed
out
the
growing
importance
of
the
work
the
enlargement
of
the
programme
which
starting
from
the
discussion
of
wages
was
now
working
towards
a
social
liquidation
to
have
done
with
the
wage
system
no
more
nationalities
the
workers
of
the
whole
world
would
be
united
by
a
common
need
for
justice
sweeping
away
the
corruption
founding
at
last
a
free
society
in
which
he
who
did
not
work
should
not
reap
he
roared
his
breath
startled
the
flowers
of
painted
paper
beneath
the
low
smoky
ceiling
which
sent
back
the
sound
of
his
voice
a
wave
passed
through
the
audience
some
of
them
cried
that
it
we
with
you
he
went
on
the
world
would
be
conquered
before
three
years
and
he
enumerated
the
nations
already
conquered
from
all
sides
adhesions
were
raining
in
never
had
a
young
religion
counted
so
many
disciples
then
when
they
had
the
upper
hand
they
would
dictate
terms
to
the
masters
who
in
their
turn
would
have
a
fist
at
their
throats
yes
yes
they
have
to
go
down
with
a
gesture
he
enforced
silence
now
he
was
entering
on
the
strike
question
in
principle
he
disapproved
of
strikes
it
was
a
slow
method
which
aggravated
the
sufferings
of
the
worker
but
before
better
things
arrived
and
when
they
were
inevitable
one
must
make
up
one
mind
to
them
for
they
had
the
advantage
of
disorganizing
capital
and
in
this
case
he
showed
the
international
as
providence
for
strikers
and
quoted
examples
in
paris
during
the
strike
of
the
the
masters
had
granted
everything
at
once
terrified
at
the
news
that
the
international
was
sending
help
in
london
it
had
saved
the
miners
at
a
colliery
by
sending
back
at
its
own
expense
a
of
belgians
who
had
been
brought
over
by
the
it
was
sufficient
to
join
and
the
companies
trembled
for
the
men
entered
the
great
army
of
workers
who
were
resolved
to
die
for
one
another
rather
than
to
remain
the
slaves
of
a
capitalistic
society
applause
interrupted
him
he
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
at
the
same
time
refusing
a
glass
which
maheu
passed
to
him
when
he
was
about
to
continue
fresh
applause
cut
short
his
speech
it
all
right
he
said
rapidly
to
étienne
they
had
enough
quick
the
cards
he
had
plunged
beneath
the
table
and
reappeared
with
the
little
black
wooden
box
citizens
he
shouted
dominating
the
disturbance
here
are
the
cards
of
membership
let
your
delegates
come
up
and
i
will
give
them
to
them
to
be
distributed
later
on
we
can
arrange
everything
rasseneur
rushed
forward
and
again
protested
étienne
was
also
agitated
having
to
make
a
speech
extreme
confusion
followed
levaque
jumped
up
with
his
fists
out
as
if
to
fight
maheu
was
up
and
speaking
but
nobody
could
distinguish
a
single
word
in
the
growing
tumult
the
dust
rose
from
the
floor
a
floating
dust
of
former
balls
poisoning
the
air
with
a
strong
odour
of
putters
and
trammers
suddenly
the
little
door
opened
and
widow
désir
filled
it
with
her
belly
and
breast
shouting
in
a
thundering
voice
for
god
sake
silence
the
gendarmes
it
was
the
commissioner
of
the
district
who
had
arrived
rather
late
to
prepare
a
report
and
to
break
up
the
meeting
four
gendarmes
accompanied
him
for
five
minutes
the
widow
had
delayed
them
at
the
door
replying
that
she
was
at
home
and
that
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
entertain
her
friends
but
they
had
hustled
her
away
and
she
had
rushed
in
to
warn
her
children
must
clear
out
through
here
she
said
again
there
a
dirty
gendarme
guarding
the
court
it
does
matter
my
little
opens
into
the
alley
quick
then
the
commissioner
was
already
knocking
with
his
fist
and
as
the
door
was
not
opened
he
threatened
to
force
it
a
spy
must
have
talked
for
he
cried
that
the
meeting
was
illegal
a
large
number
of
miners
being
there
without
any
letter
of
invitation
in
the
hall
the
trouble
was
growing
they
could
not
escape
thus
they
had
not
even
voted
either
for
adhesion
or
for
the
continuation
of
the
strike
all
persisted
in
talking
at
the
same
time
at
last
the
chairman
suggested
a
vote
by
acclamation
arms
were
raised
and
the
delegates
declared
hastily
that
they
would
join
in
the
name
of
their
absent
mates
and
it
was
thus
that
the
ten
thousand
colliers
of
montsou
became
members
of
the
international
meanwhile
the
retreat
began
in
order
to
cover
it
widow
désir
had
propped
herself
up
against
the
door
which
the
of
the
gendarmes
muskets
were
forcing
at
her
back
the
miners
jumped
over
the
benches
and
escaped
one
by
one
through
the
kitchen
and
the
rasseneur
disappeared
among
the
first
and
levaque
followed
him
forgetful
of
his
abuse
and
planning
how
he
could
get
an
offer
of
a
glass
to
pull
himself
together
étienne
after
having
seized
the
little
box
waited
with
pluchart
and
maheu
who
considered
it
a
point
of
honour
to
emerge
last
as
they
disappeared
the
lock
gave
and
the
commissioner
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
widow
whose
breast
and
belly
still
formed
a
barricade
it
does
help
you
much
to
smash
everything
in
my
house
she
said
you
can
see
there
nobody
here
the
commissioner
a
slow
man
who
did
not
care
for
scenes
simply
threatened
to
take
her
off
to
prison
and
he
then
went
away
with
his
four
gendarmes
to
prepare
a
report
beneath
the
jeers
of
zacharie
and
mouquet
who
were
full
of
admiration
for
the
way
in
which
their
mates
had
humbugged
this
armed
force
for
which
they
themselves
did
not
care
a
hang
in
the
alley
outside
étienne
embarrassed
by
the
box
was
rushing
along
followed
by
the
others
he
suddenly
thought
of
pierron
and
asked
why
he
had
not
turned
up
maheu
also
running
replied
that
he
was
ill
a
convenient
illness
the
fear
of
compromising
himself
they
wished
to
retain
pluchart
but
without
stopping
he
declared
that
he
must
set
out
at
once
for
joiselle
where
legoujeux
was
awaiting
orders
then
as
they
ran
they
shouted
out
to
him
their
wishes
for
a
pleasant
journey
and
rushed
through
montsou
with
their
heels
in
the
air
a
few
words
were
exchanged
broken
by
the
panting
of
their
chests
étienne
and
maheu
were
laughing
confidently
henceforth
certain
of
victory
when
the
international
had
sent
help
it
would
be
the
company
that
would
beg
them
to
resume
work
and
in
this
burst
of
hope
in
this
gallop
of
big
boots
sounding
over
the
pavement
of
the
streets
there
was
something
else
also
something
sombre
and
fierce
a
gust
of
violence
which
would
inflame
the
settlements
in
the
four
corners
of
the
country
chapter
v
another
fortnight
had
passed
by
it
was
the
beginning
of
january
and
cold
mists
benumbed
the
immense
plain
the
misery
had
grown
still
greater
and
the
settlements
were
in
agony
from
hour
to
hour
beneath
the
increasing
famine
four
thousand
francs
sent
by
the
international
from
london
had
scarcely
supplied
bread
for
three
days
and
then
nothing
had
come
this
great
dead
hope
was
beating
down
their
courage
on
what
were
they
to
count
now
since
even
their
brothers
had
abandoned
them
they
felt
themselves
separated
from
the
world
and
lost
in
the
midst
of
this
deep
winter
on
tuesday
no
resources
were
left
in
the
settlement
étienne
and
the
delegates
had
multiplied
their
energies
new
subscriptions
were
opened
in
the
neighbouring
towns
and
even
in
paris
collections
were
made
and
lectures
organized
these
efforts
came
to
nothing
public
opinion
which
had
at
first
been
moved
grew
indifferent
now
that
the
strike
dragged
on
for
ever
and
so
quietly
without
any
dramatic
incidents
small
charities
scarcely
sufficed
to
maintain
the
poorer
families
the
others
lived
by
pawning
their
clothes
and
selling
up
the
household
piece
by
piece
everything
went
to
the
brokers
the
wool
of
the
mattresses
the
kitchen
utensils
even
the
furniture
for
a
moment
they
thought
themselves
saved
for
the
small
retail
shopkeepers
of
montsou
killed
out
by
maigrat
had
offered
credit
to
try
and
get
back
their
custom
and
for
a
week
verdonck
the
grocer
and
the
two
bakers
carouble
and
smelten
kept
open
shop
but
when
their
advances
were
exhausted
all
three
stopped
the
bailiffs
were
rejoicing
there
only
resulted
a
piling
up
of
debts
which
would
for
a
long
time
weigh
upon
the
miners
there
was
no
more
credit
to
be
had
anywhere
and
not
an
old
saucepan
to
sell
they
might
lie
down
in
a
corner
to
die
like
mangy
dogs
étienne
would
have
sold
his
flesh
he
had
given
up
his
salary
and
had
gone
to
marchiennes
to
pawn
his
trousers
and
cloth
coat
happy
to
set
the
maheus
pot
boiling
once
more
his
boots
alone
remained
and
he
retained
these
to
keep
a
firm
foothold
he
said
his
grief
was
that
the
strike
had
come
on
too
early
before
the
provident
fund
had
had
time
to
swell
he
regarded
this
as
the
only
cause
of
the
disaster
for
the
workers
would
surely
triumph
over
the
masters
on
the
day
when
they
had
saved
enough
money
to
resist
and
he
recalled
souvarine
words
accusing
the
company
of
pushing
forward
the
strike
to
destroy
the
fund
at
the
beginning
the
sight
of
the
settlement
and
of
these
poor
people
without
bread
or
fire
overcame
him
he
preferred
to
go
out
and
to
weary
himself
with
distant
walks
one
evening
as
he
was
coming
back
and
passing
near
réquillart
he
perceived
an
old
woman
who
had
fainted
by
the
roadside
no
doubt
she
was
dying
of
hunger
and
having
raised
her
he
began
to
shout
to
a
girl
whom
he
saw
on
the
other
side
of
the
paling
why
is
it
you
he
said
recognizing
mouquette
come
and
help
me
then
we
must
give
her
something
to
drink
mouquette
moved
to
tears
quickly
went
into
the
shaky
hovel
which
her
father
had
set
up
in
the
midst
of
the
ruins
she
came
back
at
once
with
gin
and
a
loaf
the
gin
revived
the
old
woman
who
without
speaking
bit
greedily
into
the
bread
she
was
the
mother
of
a
miner
who
lived
at
a
settlement
on
the
cougny
side
and
she
had
fallen
there
on
returning
from
joiselle
where
she
had
in
vain
attempted
to
borrow
half
a
franc
from
a
sister
when
she
had
eaten
she
went
away
dazed
étienne
stood
in
the
open
field
of
réquillart
where
the
crumbling
sheds
were
disappearing
beneath
the
brambles
well
wo
you
come
in
and
drink
a
little
glass
asked
mouquette
merrily
and
as
he
hesitated
then
you
still
afraid
of
me
he
followed
her
won
by
her
laughter
this
bread
which
she
had
given
so
willingly
moved
him
she
would
not
take
him
into
her
father
room
but
led
him
into
her
own
room
where
she
at
once
poured
out
two
little
glasses
of
gin
the
room
was
very
neat
and
he
complimented
her
on
it
besides
the
family
seemed
to
want
for
nothing
the
father
continued
his
duties
as
a
groom
at
the
voreux
while
she
saying
that
she
could
not
live
with
folded
arms
had
become
a
laundress
which
brought
her
in
thirty
sous
a
day
one
may
amuse
oneself
with
men
but
one
is
lazy
for
all
that
i
say
she
murmured
all
at
once
coming
and
putting
her
arms
round
him
prettily
why
do
you
like
me
he
could
not
help
laughing
she
had
done
this
in
so
charming
a
way
but
i
like
you
very
much
he
replied
no
no
not
like
i
mean
you
know
that
i
am
dying
of
longing
come
it
would
give
me
so
much
pleasure
it
was
true
she
had
desired
him
for
six
months
he
still
looked
at
her
as
she
clung
to
him
pressing
him
with
her
two
tremulous
arms
her
face
raised
with
such
supplicating
love
that
he
was
deeply
moved
there
was
nothing
beautiful
in
her
large
round
face
with
its
yellow
complexion
eaten
by
the
coal
but
her
eyes
shone
with
flame
a
charm
rose
from
her
skin
a
trembling
of
desire
which
made
her
rosy
and
young
in
face
of
this
gift
which
was
so
humble
and
so
ardent
he
no
longer
dared
to
refuse
oh
you
are
willing
she
stammered
delighted
oh
you
are
willing
and
she
gave
herself
up
with
the
fainting
awkwardness
of
a
virgin
as
if
it
was
for
the
first
time
and
she
had
never
before
known
a
man
then
when
he
left
her
it
was
she
who
was
overcome
with
gratitude
she
thanked
him
and
kissed
his
hands
étienne
remained
rather
ashamed
of
this
good
fortune
nobody
boasted
of
having
had
mouquette
as
he
went
away
he
swore
that
it
should
not
occur
again
but
he
preserved
a
friendly
remembrance
of
her
she
was
a
capital
girl
when
he
got
back
to
the
settlement
he
found
serious
news
which
made
him
forget
the
adventure
the
rumour
was
circulating
that
the
company
would
perhaps
agree
to
make
a
concession
if
the
delegates
made
a
fresh
attempt
with
the
manager
at
all
events
some
captains
had
spread
this
rumour
the
truth
was
that
in
this
struggle
the
mine
was
suffering
even
more
than
the
miners
on
both
sides
obstinacy
was
piling
up
ruin
while
labour
was
dying
of
hunger
capital
was
being
destroyed
every
day
of
rest
carried
away
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
every
machine
which
stops
is
a
dead
machine
tools
and
material
are
impaired
the
money
that
is
sunk
melts
away
like
water
drunk
by
the
sand
since
the
small
stock
of
coal
at
the
surface
of
the
pits
was
exhausted
customers
talked
of
going
to
belgium
so
that
in
future
they
would
be
threatened
from
that
quarter
but
what
especially
frightened
the
company
although
the
matter
was
carefully
concealed
was
the
increasing
damage
to
the
galleries
and
workings
the
captains
could
not
cope
with
the
repairs
the
timber
was
falling
everywhere
and
landslips
were
constantly
taking
place
soon
the
disasters
became
so
serious
that
long
months
would
be
needed
for
repairs
before
hewing
could
be
resumed
already
stories
were
going
about
the
country
at
crévecoeur
three
hundred
metres
of
road
had
subsided
in
a
mass
stopping
up
access
to
the
at
madeleine
the
maugrétout
seam
was
crumbling
away
and
filling
with
water
the
management
refused
to
admit
this
but
suddenly
two
accidents
one
after
the
other
had
forced
them
to
avow
it
one
morning
near
piolaine
the
ground
was
found
cracked
above
the
north
gallery
of
mirou
which
had
fallen
in
the
day
before
and
on
the
following
day
the
ground
subsided
within
the
voreux
shaking
a
corner
of
a
suburb
to
such
an
extent
that
two
houses
nearly
disappeared
étienne
and
the
delegates
hesitated
to
risk
any
steps
without
knowing
the
directors
intentions
dansaert
whom
they
questioned
avoided
replying
certainly
the
misunderstanding
was
deplored
and
everything
would
be
done
to
bring
about
an
agreement
but
he
could
say
nothing
definitely
at
last
they
decided
that
they
would
go
to
hennebeau
in
order
to
have
reason
on
their
side
for
they
did
not
wish
to
be
accused
later
on
of
having
refused
the
company
an
opportunity
of
acknowledging
that
it
had
been
in
the
wrong
only
they
vowed
to
yield
nothing
and
to
maintain
in
spite
of
everything
their
terms
which
were
alone
just
the
interview
took
place
on
tuesday
morning
when
the
settlement
was
sinking
into
desperate
wretchedness
it
was
less
cordial
than
the
first
interview
maheu
was
still
the
speaker
and
he
explained
that
their
mates
had
sent
them
to
ask
if
these
gentlemen
had
anything
new
to
say
at
first
hennebeau
affected
surprise
no
order
had
reached
him
nothing
could
be
changed
so
long
as
the
miners
persisted
in
their
detestable
rebellion
and
this
official
stiffness
produced
the
worst
effects
so
that
if
the
delegates
had
gone
out
of
their
way
to
offer
conciliation
the
way
in
which
they
were
received
would
only
have
served
to
make
them
more
obstinate
afterwards
the
manager
tried
to
seek
a
basis
of
mutual
concession
thus
if
the
men
would
accept
the
separate
payment
for
timbering
the
company
would
raise
that
payment
by
the
two
centimes
which
they
were
accused
of
profiting
by
besides
he
added
that
he
would
take
the
offer
on
himself
that
nothing
was
settled
but
that
he
flattered
himself
he
could
obtain
this
concession
from
paris
but
the
delegates
refused
and
repeated
their
demands
the
retention
of
the
old
system
with
a
rise
of
five
centimes
a
tram
then
he
acknowledged
that
he
could
treat
with
them
at
once
and
urged
them
to
accept
in
the
name
of
their
wives
and
little
ones
dying
of
hunger
and
with
eyes
on
the
ground
and
stiff
heads
they
said
no
always
no
with
fierce
vigour
they
separated
curtly
hennebeau
banged
the
doors
étienne
maheu
and
the
others
went
off
stamping
with
their
great
heels
on
the
pavement
in
the
mute
rage
of
the
vanquished
pushed
to
extremes
towards
two
the
women
of
the
settlement
on
their
side
made
an
application
to
maigrat
there
was
only
this
hope
left
to
bend
this
man
and
to
wrench
from
him
another
week
credit
the
idea
originated
with
maheude
who
often
counted
too
much
on
people
she
persuaded
the
brulé
and
the
levaque
to
accompany
her
as
to
pierronne
she
excused
herself
saying
that
she
could
not
leave
pierron
whose
illness
still
continued
other
women
joined
the
band
till
they
numbered
quite
twenty
when
the
inhabitants
of
montsou
saw
them
arrive
gloomy
and
wretched
occupying
the
whole
width
of
the
road
they
shook
their
heads
anxiously
doors
were
closed
and
one
lady
hid
her
plate
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
been
seen
thus
and
there
could
not
be
a
worse
sign
usually
everything
was
going
to
ruin
when
the
women
thus
took
to
the
roads
at
maigrat
there
was
a
violent
scene
at
first
he
had
made
them
go
in
jeering
and
pretending
to
believe
that
they
had
come
to
pay
their
debts
that
was
nice
of
them
to
have
agreed
to
come
and
bring
the
money
all
at
once
then
as
soon
as
maheude
began
to
speak
he
pretended
to
be
enraged
were
they
making
fun
of
people
more
credit
then
they
wanted
to
turn
him
into
the
street
no
not
a
single
potato
not
a
single
crumb
of
bread
and
he
told
them
to
be
off
to
the
grocer
verdonck
and
to
the
bakers
carouble
and
smelten
since
they
now
dealt
with
them
the
women
listened
with
timid
humility
apologizing
and
watching
his
eyes
to
see
if
he
would
relent
he
began
to
joke
offering
his
shop
to
the
brulé
if
she
would
have
him
as
a
lover
they
were
all
so
cowardly
that
they
laughed
at
this
and
the
levaque
improved
on
it
declaring
that
she
was
willing
she
was
but
he
at
once
became
abusive
and
pushed
them
towards
the
door
as
they
insisted
suppliantly
he
treated
one
brutally
the
others
on
the
pavement
shouted
that
he
had
sold
himself
to
the
company
while
maheude
with
her
arms
in
the
air
in
a
burst
of
avenging
indignation
cried
out
for
his
death
exclaiming
that
such
a
man
did
not
deserve
to
eat
the
return
to
the
settlement
was
melancholy
when
the
women
came
back
with
empty
hands
the
men
looked
at
them
and
then
lowered
their
heads
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
the
day
would
end
without
a
spoonful
of
soup
and
the
other
days
extended
in
an
icy
shadow
without
a
ray
of
hope
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
it
and
no
one
spoke
of
surrender
this
excess
of
misery
made
them
still
more
obstinate
mute
as
tracked
beasts
resolved
to
die
at
the
bottom
of
their
hole
rather
than
come
out
who
would
dare
to
be
first
to
speak
of
submission
they
had
sworn
with
their
mates
to
hold
together
and
hold
together
they
would
as
they
held
together
at
the
pit
when
one
of
them
was
beneath
a
landslip
it
was
as
it
ought
to
be
it
was
a
good
school
for
resignation
down
there
they
might
well
tighten
their
belts
for
a
week
when
they
had
been
swallowing
fire
and
water
ever
since
they
were
twelve
years
of
age
and
their
devotion
was
thus
augmented
by
the
pride
of
soldiers
of
men
proud
of
their
profession
who
in
their
daily
struggle
with
death
had
gained
a
pride
in
sacrifice
with
the
maheus
it
was
a
terrible
evening
they
were
all
silent
seated
before
the
dying
fire
in
which
the
last
cinders
were
smoking
after
having
emptied
the
mattresses
handful
by
handful
they
had
decided
the
day
before
to
sell
the
clock
for
three
francs
and
the
room
seemed
bare
and
dead
now
that
the
familiar
no
longer
filled
it
with
sound
the
only
object
of
luxury
now
in
the
middle
of
the
sideboard
was
the
rose
cardboard
box
an
old
present
from
maheu
which
maheude
treasured
like
a
jewel
the
two
good
chairs
had
gone
father
bonnemort
and
the
children
were
squeezed
together
on
an
old
mossy
bench
brought
in
from
the
garden
and
the
livid
twilight
now
coming
on
seemed
to
increase
the
cold
what
to
be
done
repeated
maheude
crouching
down
in
the
corner
by
the
oven
étienne
stood
up
looking
at
the
portraits
of
the
emperor
and
empress
stuck
against
the
wall
he
would
have
torn
them
down
long
since
if
the
family
had
not
preserved
them
for
ornament
so
he
murmured
with
clenched
teeth
and
to
think
that
we
ca
get
two
sous
out
of
these
damned
idiots
who
are
watching
us
starve
if
i
were
to
take
the
box
said
the
woman
very
pale
after
some
hesitation
maheu
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
table
with
his
legs
dangling
and
his
head
on
his
chest
sat
up
no
i
wo
have
it
maheude
painfully
rose
and
walked
round
the
room
good
god
was
it
possible
that
they
were
reduced
to
such
misery
the
cupboard
without
a
crumb
nothing
more
to
sell
no
notion
where
to
get
a
loaf
and
the
fire
which
was
nearly
out
she
became
angry
with
alzire
whom
she
had
sent
in
the
morning
to
glean
on
the
and
who
had
come
back
with
empty
hands
saying
that
the
company
would
not
allow
gleaning
did
it
matter
a
hang
what
the
company
wanted
as
if
they
were
robbing
any
one
by
picking
up
the
bits
of
lost
coal
the
little
girl
in
despair
told
how
a
man
had
threatened
to
hit
her
then
she
promised
to
go
back
next
day
even
if
she
was
beaten
and
that
imp
jeanlin
cried
the
mother
where
is
he
now
i
should
like
to
know
he
ought
to
have
brought
the
salad
we
can
browse
on
that
like
beasts
at
all
events
you
will
see
he
wo
come
back
yesterday
too
he
slept
out
i
do
know
what
he
up
to
the
rascal
always
looks
as
though
his
belly
were
full
perhaps
said
étienne
he
picks
up
sous
on
the
road
she
suddenly
lifted
both
fists
furiously
if
i
knew
that
my
children
beg
i
rather
kill
them
and
myself
too
maheu
had
again
sunk
down
on
the
edge
of
the
table
lénore
and
henri
astonished
that
they
had
nothing
to
eat
began
to
moan
while
old
bonnemort
in
silence
philosophically
rolled
his
tongue
in
his
mouth
to
deceive
his
hunger
no
one
spoke
any
more
all
were
becoming
benumbed
beneath
this
aggravation
of
their
evils
the
grandfather
coughing
and
spitting
out
the
black
phlegm
taken
again
by
rheumatism
which
was
turning
to
dropsy
the
father
asthmatic
and
with
knees
swollen
with
water
the
mother
and
the
little
ones
scarred
by
scrofula
and
hereditary
anaemia
no
doubt
their
work
made
this
inevitable
they
only
complained
when
the
lack
of
food
killed
them
off
and
already
they
were
falling
like
flies
in
the
settlement
but
something
must
be
found
for
supper
my
god
where
was
it
to
be
found
what
was
to
be
done
then
in
the
twilight
which
made
the
room
more
and
more
gloomy
with
its
dark
melancholy
étienne
who
had
been
hesitating
for
a
moment
at
last
decided
with
aching
heart
wait
for
me
he
said
i
go
and
see
somewhere
and
he
went
out
the
idea
of
mouquette
had
occurred
to
him
she
would
certainly
have
a
loaf
and
would
give
it
willingly
it
annoyed
him
to
be
thus
forced
to
return
to
réquillart
this
girl
would
kiss
his
hands
with
her
air
of
an
amorous
servant
but
one
did
not
leave
one
friends
in
trouble
he
would
still
be
kind
with
her
if
need
be
i
will
go
and
look
round
too
said
maheude
in
her
turn
it
too
stupid
she
reopened
the
door
after
the
young
man
and
closed
it
violently
leaving
the
others
motionless
and
mute
in
the
faint
light
of
a
which
alzire
had
just
lighted
outside
she
stopped
and
thought
for
a
moment
then
she
entered
the
levaque
house
tell
me
i
lent
you
a
loaf
the
other
day
could
you
give
it
me
back
but
she
stopped
herself
what
she
saw
was
far
from
encouraging
the
house
spoke
of
misery
even
more
than
her
own
the
levaque
woman
with
fixed
eyes
was
gazing
into
her
fire
while
levaque
made
drunk
on
his
empty
stomach
by
some
was
sleeping
on
the
table
with
his
back
to
the
wall
bouteloup
was
mechanically
rubbing
his
shoulders
with
the
amazement
of
a
fellow
who
has
eaten
up
his
savings
and
is
astonished
at
having
to
tighten
his
belt
a
loaf
ah
my
dear
replied
the
levaque
woman
i
wanted
to
borrow
another
from
you
then
as
her
husband
groaned
with
pain
in
his
sleep
she
pushed
his
face
against
the
table
hold
your
row
bloody
beast
so
much
the
better
if
it
burns
your
guts
instead
of
getting
people
to
pay
for
your
drinks
you
ought
to
have
asked
twenty
sous
from
a
friend
she
went
on
relieving
herself
by
swearing
in
the
midst
of
this
dirty
household
already
abandoned
so
long
that
an
unbearable
smell
was
exhaling
from
the
floor
everything
might
smash
up
she
did
care
a
hang
her
son
that
rascal
bébert
had
also
disappeared
since
morning
and
she
shouted
that
it
would
be
a
good
riddance
if
he
never
came
back
then
she
said
that
she
would
go
to
bed
at
least
she
could
get
warm
she
hustled
bouteloup
come
along
up
we
go
the
fire
out
no
need
to
light
the
candle
to
see
the
empty
plates
well
are
you
coming
louis
i
tell
you
that
we
must
go
to
bed
we
can
cuddle
up
together
there
that
a
comfort
and
let
this
damned
drunkard
die
here
of
cold
by
himself
when
she
found
herself
outside
again
maheude
struck
resolutely
across
the
gardens
towards
pierron
house
she
heard
laughter
as
she
knocked
there
was
sudden
silence
it
was
a
full
minute
before
the
door
was
opened
what
is
it
you
exclaimed
pierronne
with
affected
surprise
i
thought
it
was
the
doctor
without
allowing
her
to
speak
she
went
on
pointing
to
pierron
who
was
seated
before
a
large
coal
fire
ah
he
makes
no
progress
he
makes
no
progress
at
all
his
face
looks
all
right
it
in
his
belly
that
it
takes
him
then
he
must
have
warmth
we
burn
all
that
we
got
pierron
in
fact
looked
very
well
his
complexion
was
good
and
his
flesh
fat
it
was
in
vain
that
he
breathed
hard
in
order
to
play
the
sick
man
besides
as
maheude
came
in
she
perceived
a
strong
smell
of
rabbit
they
had
certainly
put
the
dish
out
of
the
way
there
were
crumbs
strewed
over
the
table
and
in
the
very
midst
she
saw
a
forgotten
bottle
of
wine
mother
has
gone
to
montsou
to
try
and
get
a
loaf
said
pierronne
again
we
are
cooling
our
heels
waiting
for
her
but
her
voice
choked
she
had
followed
her
neighbour
glance
and
her
eyes
also
fell
on
the
bottle
immediately
she
began
again
and
narrated
the
story
yes
it
was
wine
the
piolaine
people
had
brought
her
that
bottle
for
her
man
who
had
been
ordered
by
the
doctor
to
take
claret
and
her
thankfulness
poured
forth
in
a
stream
what
good
people
they
were
the
young
lady
especially
she
was
not
proud
going
into
workpeople
houses
and
distributing
her
charities
herself
i
see
said
maheude
i
know
them
her
heart
ached
at
the
idea
that
the
good
things
always
go
to
the
least
poor
it
was
always
so
and
these
piolaine
people
had
carried
water
to
the
river
why
had
she
not
seen
them
in
the
settlement
perhaps
all
the
same
she
might
have
got
something
out
of
them
i
came
she
confessed
at
last
to
know
if
there
was
more
going
with
you
than
with
us
have
you
just
a
little
vermicelli
by
way
of
loan
pierronne
expressed
her
grief
noisily
nothing
at
all
my
dear
not
what
you
can
call
a
grain
of
semolina
if
mother
has
come
back
it
because
she
has
succeeded
we
must
go
to
bed
supperless
at
this
moment
crying
was
heard
from
the
cellar
and
she
grew
angry
and
struck
her
fist
against
the
door
it
was
that
gadabout
lydie
whom
she
had
shut
up
she
said
to
punish
her
for
not
having
returned
until
five
after
having
been
roaming
about
the
whole
day
one
could
no
longer
keep
her
in
order
she
was
constantly
disappearing
maheude
however
remained
standing
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
leave
this
large
fire
filled
her
with
a
painful
sensation
of
comfort
the
thought
that
they
were
eating
there
enlarged
the
void
in
her
stomach
evidently
they
had
sent
away
the
old
woman
and
shut
up
the
child
to
blow
themselves
out
with
their
rabbit
ah
whatever
people
might
say
when
a
woman
behaved
ill
that
brought
luck
to
her
house
good
night
she
said
suddenly
outside
night
had
come
on
and
the
moon
behind
the
clouds
was
lighting
up
the
earth
with
a
dubious
glow
instead
of
traversing
the
gardens
again
maheude
went
round
despairing
afraid
to
go
home
again
but
along
the
dead
frontages
all
the
doors
smelled
of
famine
and
sounded
hollow
what
was
the
good
of
knocking
there
was
wretchedness
everywhere
for
weeks
since
they
had
had
nothing
to
eat
even
the
odour
of
onion
had
gone
that
strong
odour
which
revealed
the
settlement
from
afar
across
the
country
now
there
was
nothing
but
the
smell
of
old
vaults
the
dampness
of
holes
in
which
nothing
lives
vague
sounds
were
dying
out
stifled
tears
lost
oaths
and
in
the
silence
which
slowly
grew
heavier
one
could
hear
the
sleep
of
hunger
coming
on
the
collapse
of
bodies
thrown
across
beds
in
the
nightmares
of
empty
bellies
as
she
passed
before
the
church
she
saw
a
shadow
slip
rapidly
by
a
gleam
of
hope
made
her
hasten
for
she
had
recognized
the
montsou
priest
abbé
joire
who
said
mass
on
sundays
at
the
settlement
chapel
no
doubt
he
had
just
come
out
of
the
sacristy
where
he
had
been
called
to
settle
some
affair
with
rounded
back
he
moved
quickly
on
a
fat
meek
man
anxious
to
live
at
peace
with
everybody
if
he
had
come
at
night
it
must
have
been
in
order
not
to
compromise
himself
among
the
miners
it
was
said
too
that
he
had
just
obtained
promotion
he
had
even
been
seen
walking
about
with
his
successor
a
lean
man
with
eyes
like
live
coals
sir
sir
stammered
maheude
but
he
would
not
stop
good
night
good
night
my
good
woman
she
found
herself
before
her
own
door
her
legs
would
no
longer
carry
her
and
she
went
in
no
one
had
stirred
maheu
still
sat
dejected
on
the
edge
of
the
table
old
bonnemort
and
the
little
ones
were
huddled
together
on
the
bench
for
the
sake
of
warmth
and
they
had
not
said
a
word
and
the
candle
had
burnt
so
low
that
even
light
would
soon
fail
them
at
the
sound
of
the
door
the
children
turned
their
heads
but
seeing
that
their
mother
brought
nothing
back
they
looked
down
on
the
ground
again
repressing
the
longing
to
cry
for
fear
of
being
scolded
maheude
fell
back
into
her
place
near
the
dying
fire
they
asked
her
no
questions
and
the
silence
continued
all
had
understood
and
they
thought
it
useless
to
weary
themselves
more
by
talking
they
were
now
waiting
despairing
and
without
courage
in
the
last
expectation
that
perhaps
étienne
would
unearth
help
somewhere
the
minutes
went
by
and
at
last
they
no
longer
reckoned
on
this
when
étienne
reappeared
he
held
a
cloth
containing
a
dozen
potatoes
cooked
but
cold
that
all
that
i
found
he
said
with
mouquette
also
bread
was
wanting
it
was
her
dinner
which
she
had
forced
him
to
take
in
this
cloth
kissing
him
with
all
her
heart
thanks
he
said
to
maheude
who
offered
him
his
share
i
eaten
over
there
it
was
not
true
and
he
gloomily
watched
the
children
throw
themselves
on
the
food
the
father
and
mother
also
restrained
themselves
in
order
to
leave
more
but
the
old
man
greedily
swallowed
everything
they
had
to
take
a
potato
away
from
him
for
alzire
then
étienne
said
that
he
had
heard
news
the
company
irritated
by
the
obstinacy
of
the
strikers
talked
of
giving
back
their
certificates
to
the
compromised
miners
certainly
the
company
was
for
war
and
a
more
serious
rumour
circulated
they
boasted
of
having
persuaded
a
large
number
of
men
to
go
down
again
on
the
next
day
the
victoire
and
would
be
complete
even
at
madeleine
and
mirou
there
would
be
a
third
of
the
men
the
maheus
were
furious
by
god
shouted
the
father
if
there
are
traitors
we
must
settle
their
account
and
standing
up
yielding
to
the
fury
of
his
suffering
evening
to
the
forest
since
they
wo
let
us
come
to
an
understanding
at
the
we
can
be
at
home
in
the
forest
this
cry
had
aroused
old
bonnemort
who
had
grown
drowsy
after
his
gluttony
it
was
the
old
the
rendezvous
where
the
miners
of
old
days
used
to
plot
their
resistance
to
the
king
soldiers
yes
yes
to
vandame
i
with
you
if
you
go
there
maheude
made
an
energetic
gesture
we
will
all
go
that
will
finish
these
injustices
and
treacheries
étienne
decided
that
the
rendezvous
should
be
announced
to
all
the
settlements
for
the
following
evening
but
the
fire
was
dead
as
with
the
levaques
and
the
candle
suddenly
went
out
there
was
no
more
coal
and
no
more
oil
they
had
to
feel
their
way
to
bed
in
the
intense
cold
which
contracted
the
skin
the
little
ones
were
crying
chapter
vi
jeanlin
was
now
well
and
able
to
walk
but
his
legs
had
united
so
badly
that
he
limped
on
both
the
right
and
left
sides
and
moved
with
the
gait
of
a
duck
though
running
as
fast
as
formerly
with
the
skill
of
a
mischievous
and
thieving
animal
on
this
evening
in
the
dusk
on
the
réquillart
road
jeanlin
accompanied
by
his
inseparable
friends
bébert
and
lydie
was
on
the
watch
he
had
taken
ambush
in
a
vacant
space
behind
a
paling
opposite
an
obscure
grocery
shop
situated
at
the
corner
of
a
lane
an
old
woman
who
was
nearly
blind
displayed
there
three
or
four
sacks
of
lentils
and
haricots
black
with
dust
and
it
was
an
ancient
dried
codfish
hanging
by
the
door
and
stained
with
to
which
his
eyes
were
directed
twice
already
he
had
sent
bébert
to
unhook
it
but
each
time
someone
had
appeared
at
the
bend
in
the
road
always
intruders
in
the
way
one
could
not
attend
to
one
affairs
a
gentleman
went
by
on
horseback
and
the
children
flattened
themselves
at
the
bottom
of
the
paling
for
they
recognized
hennebeau
since
the
strike
he
was
often
thus
seen
along
the
roads
riding
alone
amid
the
rebellious
settlements
ascertaining
with
quiet
courage
the
condition
of
the
country
and
never
had
a
stone
whistled
by
his
ears
he
only
met
men
who
were
silent
and
slow
to
salute
him
most
often
he
came
upon
lovers
who
cared
nothing
for
politics
and
took
their
fill
of
pleasure
in
holes
and
corners
he
passed
by
on
his
trotting
mare
with
head
directed
straight
forward
so
as
to
disturb
nobody
while
his
heart
was
swelling
with
an
unappeased
desire
amid
this
gormandizing
of
free
love
he
distinctly
saw
these
small
rascals
the
little
boys
on
the
little
girl
in
a
heap
even
the
youngsters
were
already
amusing
themselves
in
their
misery
his
eyes
grew
moist
and
he
disappeared
sitting
stiffly
on
his
saddle
with
his
buttoned
up
in
a
military
manner
damned
luck
said
jeanlin
this
will
never
finish
go
on
bébert
hang
on
to
its
tail
but
two
men
once
more
appeared
and
the
child
again
stifled
an
oath
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
brother
zacharie
narrating
to
mouquet
how
he
had
discovered
a
piece
sewn
into
one
of
his
petticoats
they
both
grinned
with
satisfaction
slapping
each
other
on
the
shoulder
mouquet
proposed
a
game
of
crosse
for
the
next
day
they
would
leave
the
avantage
at
two
and
go
to
the
montoire
side
near
marchiennes
zacharie
agreed
what
was
the
good
of
bothering
over
the
strike
as
well
amuse
oneself
since
there
nothing
to
do
and
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
road
when
étienne
who
was
coming
along
the
canal
stopped
them
and
began
to
talk
are
they
going
to
bed
here
said
jeanlin
in
exasperation
nearly
night
the
old
woman
will
be
taking
in
her
sacks
another
miner
came
down
towards
réquillart
étienne
went
off
with
him
and
as
they
passed
the
paling
the
child
heard
them
speak
of
the
forest
they
had
been
obliged
to
put
off
the
rendezvous
to
the
following
day
for
fear
of
not
being
able
to
announce
it
in
one
day
to
all
the
settlements
i
say
there
he
whispered
to
his
two
mates
the
big
affair
is
for
we
go
eh
we
can
get
off
in
the
afternoon
and
the
road
being
at
last
free
he
sent
bébert
off
courage
hang
on
to
its
tail
and
look
out
the
old
woman
got
her
broom
fortunately
the
night
had
grown
dark
bébert
with
a
leap
hung
on
to
the
cod
so
that
the
string
broke
he
ran
away
waving
it
like
a
kite
followed
by
the
two
others
all
three
galloping
the
woman
came
out
of
her
shop
in
astonishment
without
understanding
or
being
able
to
distinguish
this
band
now
lost
in
the
darkness
these
scoundrels
had
become
the
terror
of
the
country
they
gradually
spread
themselves
over
it
like
a
horde
of
savages
at
first
they
had
been
satisfied
with
the
yard
at
the
voreux
tumbling
into
the
stock
of
coal
from
which
they
would
emerge
looking
like
negroes
playing
at
amid
the
supply
of
wood
in
which
they
lost
themselves
as
in
the
depths
of
a
virgin
forest
then
they
had
taken
the
by
assault
they
would
seat
themselves
on
it
and
slide
down
the
bare
portions
still
boiling
with
interior
fires
they
glided
among
the
briers
in
the
older
parts
hiding
for
the
whole
day
occupied
in
the
quiet
little
games
of
mischievous
mice
and
they
were
constantly
enlarging
their
conquests
scuffling
among
the
piles
of
bricks
until
blood
came
running
about
the
fields
and
eating
without
bread
all
sorts
of
milky
herbs
searching
the
banks
of
the
canals
to
take
fish
from
the
mud
and
swallow
them
raw
and
pushing
still
farther
they
travelled
for
kilometres
as
far
as
the
thickets
of
vandame
under
which
they
gorged
themselves
with
strawberries
in
the
spring
with
nuts
and
bilberries
in
summer
soon
the
immense
plain
belonged
to
them
what
drove
them
thus
from
montsou
to
marchiennes
constantly
on
the
roads
with
the
eyes
of
young
wolves
was
the
growing
love
of
plunder
jeanlin
remained
the
captain
of
these
expeditions
leading
the
troop
on
to
all
sorts
of
prey
ravaging
the
onion
fields
pillaging
the
orchards
attacking
shop
windows
in
the
country
people
accused
the
miners
on
strike
and
talked
of
a
vast
organized
band
one
day
even
he
had
forced
lydie
to
steal
from
her
mother
and
made
her
bring
him
two
dozen
sticks
of
which
pierronne
kept
in
a
bottle
on
one
of
the
boards
in
her
window
and
the
little
girl
who
was
well
beaten
had
not
betrayed
him
because
she
trembled
so
before
his
authority
the
worst
was
that
he
always
gave
himself
the
lion
share
bébert
also
had
to
bring
him
the
booty
happy
if
the
captain
did
not
hit
him
and
keep
it
all
for
some
time
jeanlin
had
abused
his
authority
he
would
beat
lydie
as
one
beats
one
lawful
wife
and
he
profited
by
bébert
credulity
to
send
him
on
unpleasant
adventures
amused
at
making
a
fool
of
this
big
boy
who
was
stronger
than
himself
and
could
have
knocked
him
over
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
he
felt
contempt
for
both
of
them
and
treated
them
as
slaves
telling
them
that
he
had
a
princess
for
his
mistress
and
that
they
were
unworthy
to
appear
before
her
and
in
fact
during
the
past
week
he
would
suddenly
disappear
at
the
end
of
a
road
or
a
turning
in
a
path
no
matter
where
it
might
be
after
having
ordered
them
with
a
terrible
air
to
go
back
to
the
settlement
but
first
he
would
pocket
the
booty
this
was
what
happened
on
the
present
occasion
give
it
up
he
said
snatching
the
cod
from
his
mate
hands
when
they
stopped
all
three
at
a
bend
in
the
road
near
réquillart
bébert
protested
i
want
some
you
know
i
took
it
eh
what
he
cried
you
have
some
if
i
give
you
some
not
sure
enough
if
there
any
left
he
pushed
lydie
and
placed
both
of
them
in
line
like
soldiers
shouldering
arms
then
passing
behind
them
now
you
must
stay
there
five
minutes
without
turning
by
god
if
you
do
turn
there
will
be
beasts
that
will
eat
you
up
and
then
you
will
go
straight
back
and
if
bébert
touches
lydie
on
the
way
i
shall
know
it
and
i
shall
hit
you
then
he
disappeared
in
the
shadow
so
lightly
that
the
sound
of
his
naked
feet
could
not
be
heard
the
two
children
remained
motionless
for
the
five
minutes
without
looking
round
for
fear
of
receiving
a
blow
from
the
invisible
slowly
a
great
affection
had
grown
up
between
them
in
their
common
terror
he
was
always
thinking
of
taking
her
and
pressing
her
very
tight
between
his
arms
as
he
had
seen
others
do
and
she
too
would
have
liked
it
for
it
would
have
been
a
change
for
her
to
be
so
nicely
caressed
but
neither
of
them
would
have
allowed
themselves
to
disobey
when
they
went
away
although
the
night
was
very
dark
they
did
not
even
kiss
each
other
they
walked
side
by
side
tender
and
despairing
certain
that
if
they
touched
one
another
the
captain
would
strike
them
from
behind
étienne
at
the
same
hour
had
entered
réquillart
the
evening
before
mouquette
had
begged
him
to
return
and
he
returned
ashamed
feeling
an
inclination
which
he
refused
to
acknowledge
for
this
girl
who
adored
him
like
a
christ
it
was
besides
with
the
intention
of
breaking
it
off
he
would
see
her
he
would
explain
to
her
that
she
ought
no
longer
to
pursue
him
on
account
of
the
mates
it
was
not
a
time
for
pleasure
it
was
dishonest
to
amuse
oneself
thus
when
people
were
dying
of
hunger
and
not
having
found
her
at
home
he
had
decided
to
wait
and
watch
the
shadows
of
the
beneath
the
ruined
steeple
the
old
shaft
opened
half
blocked
up
above
the
black
hole
a
beam
stood
erect
and
with
a
fragment
of
roof
at
the
top
it
had
the
profile
of
a
gallows
in
the
broken
walling
of
the
curbs
stood
two
trees
a
mountain
ash
and
a
plane
which
seemed
to
grow
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
it
was
a
corner
of
abandoned
wildness
the
grassy
and
fibrous
entry
of
a
gulf
embarrassed
with
old
wood
planted
with
hawthorns
and
which
were
peopled
in
the
spring
by
warblers
in
their
nests
wishing
to
avoid
the
great
expense
of
keeping
it
up
the
company
for
the
last
ten
years
had
proposed
to
fill
up
this
dead
pit
but
they
were
waiting
to
install
an
in
the
voreux
for
the
ventilation
furnace
of
the
two
pits
which
communicated
was
placed
at
the
foot
of
réquillart
of
which
the
former
served
as
a
conduit
they
were
content
to
consolidate
the
tubbing
by
beams
placed
across
preventing
extraction
and
they
had
neglected
the
upper
galleries
to
watch
only
over
the
lower
gallery
in
which
blazed
the
furnace
the
enormous
coal
fire
with
so
powerful
a
draught
that
the
rush
of
air
produced
the
wind
of
a
tempest
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
neighbouring
mine
as
a
precaution
in
order
that
they
could
still
go
up
and
down
the
order
had
been
given
to
furnish
the
shaft
with
ladders
only
as
no
one
took
charge
of
them
the
ladders
were
rotting
with
dampness
and
in
some
places
had
already
given
way
above
a
large
brier
stopped
the
entry
of
the
passage
and
as
the
first
ladder
had
lost
some
rungs
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
reach
it
to
hang
on
to
a
root
of
the
mountain
ash
and
then
to
take
one
chance
and
drop
into
the
blackness
étienne
was
waiting
patiently
hidden
behind
a
bush
when
he
heard
a
long
rustling
among
the
branches
he
thought
at
first
that
it
was
the
scared
flight
of
a
snake
but
the
sudden
gleam
of
a
match
astonished
him
and
he
was
stupefied
on
recognizing
jeanlin
who
was
lighting
a
candle
and
burying
himself
in
the
earth
he
was
seized
with
curiosity
and
approached
the
hole
the
child
had
disappeared
and
a
faint
gleam
came
from
the
second
ladder
étienne
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
let
himself
go
holding
on
to
the
roots
he
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
was
about
to
fall
down
the
whole
five
hundred
and
eighty
metres
of
the
mine
but
at
last
he
felt
a
rung
and
descended
gently
jeanlin
had
evidently
heard
nothing
étienne
constantly
saw
the
light
sinking
beneath
him
while
the
little
one
shadow
colossal
and
disturbing
danced
with
the
deformed
gait
of
his
distorted
limbs
he
kicked
his
legs
about
with
the
skill
of
a
monkey
catching
on
with
hands
feet
or
chin
where
the
rungs
were
wanting
ladders
seven
metres
in
length
followed
one
another
some
still
firm
others
shaky
yielding
and
almost
broken
the
steps
were
narrow
and
green
so
rotten
that
one
seemed
to
walk
in
moss
and
as
one
went
down
the
heat
grew
suffocating
the
heat
of
an
oven
proceeding
from
the
which
was
fortunately
not
very
active
now
the
strike
was
on
or
when
the
furnace
devoured
its
five
thousand
kilograms
of
coal
a
day
one
could
not
have
risked
oneself
here
without
scorching
one
hair
what
a
dammed
little
toad
exclaimed
étienne
in
a
stifled
voice
where
the
devil
is
he
going
to
twice
he
had
nearly
fallen
his
feet
slid
on
the
damp
wood
if
he
had
only
had
a
candle
like
the
child
but
he
struck
himself
every
minute
he
was
only
guided
by
the
vague
gleam
that
fled
beneath
him
he
had
already
reached
the
twentieth
ladder
and
the
descent
still
continued
then
he
counted
them
and
he
still
went
down
and
down
his
head
seemed
to
be
swelling
with
the
heat
and
he
thought
that
he
was
falling
into
a
furnace
at
last
he
reached
a
and
he
saw
the
candle
going
off
along
a
gallery
thirty
ladders
that
made
about
two
hundred
and
ten
metres
is
he
going
to
drag
me
about
long
he
thought
he
must
be
going
to
bury
himself
in
the
stable
but
on
the
left
the
path
which
led
to
the
stable
was
closed
by
a
landslip
the
journey
began
again
now
more
painful
and
more
dangerous
frightened
bats
flew
about
and
clung
to
the
roof
of
the
gallery
he
had
to
hasten
so
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
light
only
where
the
child
passed
with
ease
with
the
suppleness
of
a
serpent
he
could
not
glide
through
without
bruising
his
limbs
this
gallery
like
all
the
older
passages
was
narrow
and
grew
narrower
every
day
from
the
constant
fall
of
soil
at
certain
places
it
was
a
mere
tube
which
would
eventually
be
effaced
in
this
strangling
labour
the
torn
and
broken
wood
became
a
peril
threatening
to
saw
into
his
flesh
or
to
run
him
through
with
the
points
of
splinters
sharp
as
swords
he
could
only
advance
with
precaution
on
his
knees
or
belly
feeling
in
the
darkness
before
him
suddenly
a
band
of
rats
stamped
over
him
running
from
his
neck
to
his
feet
in
their
galloping
flight
blast
it
all
have
we
got
to
the
end
yet
he
grumbled
with
aching
back
and
out
of
breath
they
were
there
at
the
end
of
a
kilometre
the
tube
enlarged
they
reached
a
part
of
the
gallery
which
was
admirably
preserved
it
was
the
end
of
the
old
haulage
passage
cut
across
the
bed
like
a
natural
grotto
he
was
obliged
to
stop
he
saw
the
child
afar
placing
his
candle
between
two
stones
and
putting
himself
at
ease
with
the
quiet
and
relieved
air
of
a
man
who
is
glad
to
be
at
home
again
this
was
completely
changed
into
a
comfortable
dwelling
in
a
corner
on
the
ground
a
pile
of
hay
made
a
soft
couch
on
some
old
planks
placed
like
a
table
there
were
bread
potatoes
and
bottles
of
gin
already
opened
it
was
a
real
brigand
cavern
with
booty
piled
up
for
weeks
even
useless
booty
like
soap
and
blacking
stolen
for
the
pleasure
of
stealing
and
the
child
quite
alone
in
the
midst
of
this
plunder
was
enjoying
it
like
a
selfish
brigand
i
say
then
is
this
how
you
make
fun
of
people
cried
étienne
when
he
had
breathed
for
a
moment
you
come
and
gorge
yourself
here
when
we
are
dying
of
hunger
up
above
jeanlin
astounded
was
trembling
but
recognizing
the
young
man
he
quickly
grew
calm
will
you
come
and
dine
with
me
he
said
at
last
eh
a
bit
of
grilled
cod
you
shall
see
he
had
not
let
go
his
cod
and
he
began
to
scrape
off
the
properly
with
a
fine
new
knife
one
of
those
little
dagger
knives
with
bone
handles
on
which
mottoes
are
inscribed
this
one
simply
bore
the
word
amour
you
have
a
fine
knife
remarked
étienne
it
a
present
from
lydie
replied
jeanlin
who
neglected
to
add
that
lydie
had
stolen
it
by
his
orders
from
a
huckster
at
montsou
stationed
before
the
bar
then
as
he
still
scraped
he
added
proudly
is
it
comfortable
in
my
house
it
a
bit
warmer
than
up
above
and
it
feels
a
lot
better
étienne
had
seated
himself
and
was
amused
in
making
him
talk
he
was
no
longer
angry
he
felt
interested
in
this
debauched
child
who
was
so
brave
and
so
industrious
in
his
vices
and
in
fact
he
tasted
a
certain
comfort
in
the
bottom
of
this
hole
the
heat
was
not
too
great
an
equal
temperature
reigned
here
at
all
seasons
the
warmth
of
a
bath
while
the
rough
december
wind
was
chapping
the
skins
of
the
miserable
people
on
the
earth
as
they
grew
old
the
galleries
became
purified
from
noxious
gases
all
the
had
gone
and
one
only
smelled
now
the
odour
of
old
fermented
wood
a
subtle
ethereal
odour
as
if
sharpened
with
a
dash
of
cloves
this
wood
besides
had
become
curious
to
look
at
with
a
yellowish
pallor
of
marble
fringed
with
whitish
thread
lace
flaky
vegetations
which
seemed
to
drape
it
with
an
embroidery
of
silk
and
pearls
in
other
places
the
timber
was
bristling
with
toadstools
and
there
were
flights
of
white
butterflies
snowy
flies
and
spiders
a
decolorized
population
for
ever
ignorant
of
the
sun
then
you
not
afraid
asked
étienne
jeanlin
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
afraid
of
what
i
am
quite
alone
but
the
cod
was
at
last
scraped
he
lighted
a
little
fire
of
wood
brought
out
the
pan
and
grilled
it
then
he
cut
a
loaf
into
two
it
was
a
terribly
salt
feast
but
exquisite
all
the
same
for
strong
stomachs
étienne
had
accepted
his
share
i
am
not
astonished
you
get
fat
while
we
are
all
growing
lean
do
you
know
that
it
is
beastly
to
stuff
yourself
like
this
and
the
others
you
do
think
of
them
oh
why
are
the
others
such
fools
well
you
right
to
hide
yourself
for
if
your
father
knew
you
stole
he
would
settle
you
what
when
the
bourgeois
are
stealing
from
us
it
you
who
are
always
saying
so
if
i
nabbed
this
loaf
at
maigrat
you
may
be
pretty
sure
it
a
loaf
he
owed
us
the
young
man
was
silent
with
his
mouth
full
and
felt
troubled
he
looked
at
him
with
his
muzzle
his
green
eyes
his
large
ears
a
degenerate
abortion
with
an
obscure
intelligence
and
savage
cunning
slowly
slipping
back
into
the
animality
of
old
the
mine
which
had
made
him
had
just
finished
him
by
breaking
his
legs
and
lydie
asked
étienne
again
do
you
bring
her
here
sometimes
jeanlin
laughed
contemptuously
the
little
one
ah
no
not
i
women
blab
and
he
went
on
laughing
filled
with
immense
disdain
for
lydie
and
bébert
who
had
ever
seen
such
boobies
to
think
that
they
swallowed
all
his
humbug
and
went
away
with
empty
hands
while
he
ate
the
cod
in
this
warm
place
tickled
his
sides
with
amusement
then
he
concluded
with
the
gravity
of
a
little
philosopher
much
better
be
alone
then
there
no
falling
out
étienne
had
finished
his
bread
he
drank
a
gulp
of
the
gin
for
a
moment
he
asked
himself
if
he
ought
not
to
make
a
bad
return
for
jeanlin
hospitality
by
bringing
him
up
to
daylight
by
the
ear
and
forbidding
him
to
plunder
any
more
by
the
threat
of
telling
everything
to
his
father
but
as
he
examined
this
deep
retreat
an
idea
occurred
to
him
who
knows
if
there
might
not
be
need
for
it
either
for
mates
or
for
himself
in
case
things
should
come
to
the
worst
up
above
he
made
the
child
swear
not
to
sleep
out
as
had
sometimes
happened
when
he
forgot
himself
in
his
hay
and
taking
a
he
went
away
first
leaving
him
to
pursue
quietly
his
domestic
affairs
mouquette
seated
on
a
beam
in
spite
of
the
great
cold
had
grown
desperate
in
waiting
for
him
when
she
saw
him
she
leapt
on
to
his
neck
and
it
was
as
though
he
had
plunged
a
knife
into
her
heart
when
he
said
that
he
wished
to
see
her
no
more
good
god
why
did
she
not
love
him
enough
fearing
to
yield
to
the
desire
to
enter
with
her
he
drew
her
towards
the
road
and
explained
to
her
as
gently
as
possible
that
she
was
compromising
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
mates
that
she
was
compromising
the
political
cause
she
was
astonished
what
had
that
got
to
do
with
politics
at
last
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
he
blushed
at
being
seen
with
her
she
was
not
wounded
however
it
was
quite
natural
and
she
proposed
that
he
should
rebuff
her
before
people
so
as
to
seem
to
have
broken
with
her
but
he
would
see
her
just
once
sometimes
in
distraction
she
implored
him
she
swore
to
keep
out
of
sight
she
would
not
keep
him
five
minutes
he
was
touched
but
still
refused
it
was
necessary
then
as
he
left
her
he
wished
at
least
to
kiss
her
they
had
gradually
reached
the
first
houses
of
montsou
and
were
standing
with
their
arms
round
one
another
beneath
a
large
round
moon
when
a
woman
passed
near
them
with
a
sudden
start
as
though
she
had
knocked
against
a
stone
who
is
that
asked
étienne
anxiously
it
catherine
replied
mouquette
she
coming
back
from
the
woman
now
was
going
away
with
lowered
head
and
feeble
limbs
looking
very
tired
and
the
young
man
gazed
at
her
in
despair
at
having
been
seen
by
her
his
heart
aching
with
an
unreasonable
remorse
had
she
not
been
with
a
man
had
she
not
made
him
suffer
with
the
same
suffering
here
on
this
réquillart
road
when
she
had
given
herself
to
that
man
but
all
the
same
he
was
grieved
to
have
done
the
like
to
her
shall
i
tell
you
what
it
is
whispered
mouquette
in
tears
as
she
left
him
if
you
do
want
me
it
because
you
want
someone
else
on
the
next
day
the
weather
was
superb
it
was
one
of
those
clear
frosty
days
the
beautiful
winter
days
when
the
hard
earth
rings
like
crystal
beneath
the
feet
jeanlin
had
gone
off
at
one
but
he
had
to
wait
for
bébert
behind
the
church
and
they
nearly
set
out
without
lydie
whose
mother
had
again
shut
her
up
in
the
cellar
and
only
now
liberated
her
to
put
a
basket
on
her
arm
telling
her
that
if
she
did
not
bring
it
back
full
of
dandelions
she
should
be
shut
up
with
the
rats
all
night
long
she
was
frightened
therefore
and
wished
to
go
at
once
for
salad
jeanlin
dissuaded
her
they
would
see
later
on
for
a
long
time
poland
rasseneur
big
rabbit
had
attracted
his
attention
he
was
passing
before
the
avantage
when
just
then
the
rabbit
came
out
on
to
the
road
with
a
leap
he
seized
her
by
the
ears
stuffed
her
into
the
little
girl
basket
and
all
three
rushed
away
they
would
amuse
themselves
finely
by
making
her
run
like
a
dog
as
far
as
the
forest
but
they
stopped
to
gaze
at
zacharie
and
mouquet
who
after
having
drunk
a
glass
with
two
other
mates
had
begun
their
big
game
of
crosse
the
stake
was
a
new
cap
and
a
red
handkerchief
deposited
with
rasseneur
the
four
players
two
against
two
were
bidding
for
the
first
turn
from
the
voreux
to
the
paillot
farm
nearly
three
kilometres
and
it
was
zacharie
who
won
with
seven
strokes
while
mouquet
required
eight
they
had
placed
the
ball
the
little
boxwood
egg
on
the
pavement
with
one
end
up
each
was
holding
his
crosse
the
mallet
with
its
bent
iron
long
handle
and
network
two
struck
as
they
set
out
zacharie
in
a
masterly
manner
at
his
first
stroke
composed
of
a
series
of
three
sent
the
ball
more
than
four
hundred
yards
across
the
beetroot
fields
for
it
was
forbidden
to
play
in
the
villages
and
on
the
streets
where
people
might
be
killed
mouquet
who
was
also
a
good
player
sent
off
the
ball
with
so
vigorous
an
arm
that
his
single
stroke
brought
the
ball
a
hundred
and
fifty
metres
behind
and
the
game
went
on
backwards
and
forwards
always
running
their
feet
bruised
by
the
frozen
ridges
of
the
ploughed
fields
at
first
jeanlin
bébert
and
lydie
had
trotted
behind
the
players
delighted
with
their
vigorous
strokes
then
they
remembered
poland
whom
they
were
shaking
up
in
the
basket
and
leaving
the
game
in
the
open
country
they
took
out
the
rabbit
inquisitive
to
see
how
fast
she
could
run
she
went
off
and
they
fled
after
her
it
was
a
chase
lasting
an
hour
at
full
speed
with
constant
turns
with
shouts
to
frighten
her
and
arms
opened
and
closed
on
emptiness
if
she
had
not
been
at
the
beginning
of
pregnancy
they
would
never
have
caught
her
again
as
they
were
panting
the
sound
of
oaths
made
them
turn
their
heads
they
had
just
come
upon
the
crosse
party
again
and
zacharie
had
nearly
split
open
his
brother
skull
the
players
were
now
at
their
fourth
turn
from
the
paillot
farm
they
had
gone
off
to
the
then
from
the
to
montoire
and
now
they
were
going
in
six
strokes
from
montoire
to
that
made
two
leagues
and
a
half
in
an
hour
and
besides
they
had
had
drinks
at
the
estaminet
vincent
and
at
the
bar
mouquet
this
time
was
ahead
he
had
two
more
strokes
to
play
and
his
victory
was
certain
when
zacharie
grinning
as
he
availed
himself
of
his
privilege
played
with
so
much
skill
that
the
ball
rolled
into
a
deep
pit
mouquet
partner
could
not
get
it
out
it
was
a
disaster
all
four
shouted
the
party
was
excited
for
they
were
neck
to
neck
it
was
necessary
to
begin
again
from
the
it
was
not
two
kilometres
to
the
point
of
in
five
strokes
there
they
would
refresh
themselves
at
lerenard
but
jeanlin
had
an
idea
he
let
them
go
on
and
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
piece
of
string
which
he
tied
to
one
of
poland
legs
the
left
hind
leg
and
it
was
very
amusing
the
rabbit
ran
before
the
three
young
rascals
waddling
along
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner
that
they
had
never
laughed
so
much
before
afterwards
they
fastened
it
round
her
neck
and
let
her
run
off
and
as
she
grew
tired
they
dragged
her
on
her
belly
or
on
her
back
just
like
a
little
carriage
that
lasted
for
more
than
an
hour
she
was
moaning
when
they
quickly
put
her
back
into
the
basket
near
the
wood
at
cruchot
on
hearing
the
players
whose
game
they
had
once
more
came
across
zacharie
mouquet
and
the
two
others
were
getting
over
the
kilometres
with
no
other
rest
than
the
time
for
a
drink
at
all
the
inns
which
they
had
fixed
on
as
their
goals
from
the
they
had
gone
on
to
buchy
then
to
then
to
chamblay
the
earth
rang
beneath
the
of
their
feet
rushing
untiringly
after
the
ball
which
bounded
over
the
ice
the
weather
was
good
they
did
not
fall
in
they
only
ran
the
risk
of
breaking
their
legs
in
the
dry
air
the
great
crosse
blows
exploded
like
firearms
their
muscular
hands
grasped
the
strung
handle
their
entire
bodies
were
bent
forward
as
though
to
slay
an
ox
and
this
went
on
for
hours
from
one
end
of
the
plain
to
the
other
over
ditches
and
hedges
and
the
slopes
of
the
road
the
low
walls
of
the
enclosures
one
needed
to
have
good
bellows
in
one
chest
and
iron
hinges
in
one
knees
the
pikemen
thus
rubbed
off
the
rust
of
the
mine
with
impassioned
zeal
there
were
some
so
enthusiastic
at
that
they
could
do
ten
leagues
at
forty
they
played
no
more
they
were
too
heavy
five
struck
the
twilight
was
already
coming
on
one
more
turn
to
the
forest
of
vandame
to
decide
who
had
gained
the
cap
and
the
handkerchief
and
zacharie
joked
with
his
chaffing
indifference
for
politics
it
would
be
fine
to
tumble
down
over
there
in
the
midst
of
the
mates
as
to
jeanlin
ever
since
leaving
the
settlement
he
had
been
aiming
at
the
forest
though
apparently
only
scouring
the
fields
with
an
indignant
gesture
he
threatened
lydie
who
was
full
of
remorse
and
fear
and
talked
of
going
back
to
the
voreux
to
gather
dandelions
were
they
going
to
abandon
the
meeting
he
wanted
to
know
what
the
old
people
would
say
he
pushed
bébert
and
proposed
to
enliven
the
end
of
the
journey
as
far
as
the
trees
by
detaching
poland
and
pursuing
her
with
stones
his
real
idea
was
to
kill
her
he
wanted
to
take
her
off
and
eat
her
at
the
bottom
of
his
hole
at
réquillart
the
rabbit
ran
ahead
with
nose
in
the
air
and
ears
back
a
stone
grazed
her
back
another
cut
her
tail
and
in
spite
of
the
growing
darkness
she
would
have
been
done
for
if
the
young
rogues
had
not
noticed
étienne
and
maheu
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
glade
they
threw
themselves
on
the
animal
in
desperation
and
put
her
back
in
the
basket
almost
at
the
same
minute
zacharie
mouquet
and
the
two
others
with
their
last
blow
at
crosse
drove
the
ball
within
a
few
metres
of
the
glade
they
all
came
into
the
midst
of
the
rendezvous
through
the
whole
country
by
the
roads
and
pathways
of
the
flat
plain
ever
since
twilight
there
had
been
a
long
procession
a
rustling
of
silent
shadows
moving
separately
or
in
groups
towards
the
violet
thickets
of
the
forest
every
settlement
was
emptied
the
women
and
children
themselves
set
out
as
if
for
a
walk
beneath
the
great
clear
sky
now
the
roads
were
growing
dark
this
walking
crowd
all
gliding
towards
the
same
goal
could
no
longer
be
distinguished
but
one
felt
it
the
confused
tramping
moved
by
one
soul
between
the
hedges
among
the
bushes
there
was
only
a
light
rustling
a
vague
rumour
of
the
voices
of
the
night
hennebeau
who
was
at
this
hour
returning
home
mounted
on
his
mare
listened
to
these
vague
sounds
he
had
met
couples
long
rows
of
strollers
on
this
beautiful
winter
night
more
lovers
who
were
going
to
take
their
pleasure
mouth
to
mouth
behind
the
walls
was
it
not
what
he
always
met
girls
tumbled
over
at
the
bottom
of
every
ditch
beggars
who
crammed
themselves
with
the
only
joy
that
cost
nothing
and
these
fools
complained
of
life
when
they
could
take
their
supreme
fill
of
this
happiness
of
love
willingly
would
he
have
starved
as
they
did
if
he
could
begin
life
again
with
a
woman
who
would
give
herself
to
him
on
a
heap
of
stones
with
all
her
strength
and
all
her
heart
his
misfortune
was
without
consolation
and
he
envied
these
wretches
with
lowered
head
he
went
back
riding
his
horse
at
a
slackened
pace
rendered
desperate
by
these
long
sounds
lost
in
the
depth
of
the
black
country
in
which
he
heard
only
kisses
chapter
vii
it
was
the
that
vast
glade
just
opened
up
by
the
felling
of
trees
it
spread
out
in
a
gentle
slope
surrounded
by
tall
thickets
and
superb
beeches
with
straight
regular
trunks
which
formed
a
white
colonnade
patched
with
green
lichens
fallen
giants
were
also
lying
in
the
grass
while
on
the
left
a
mass
of
logs
formed
a
geometrical
cube
the
cold
was
sharpening
with
the
twilight
and
the
frozen
moss
crackled
beneath
the
feet
there
was
black
darkness
on
the
earth
while
the
tall
branches
showed
against
the
pale
sky
where
a
full
moon
coming
above
the
horizon
would
soon
extinguish
the
stars
nearly
three
thousand
colliers
had
come
to
the
rendezvous
a
swarming
crowd
of
men
women
and
children
gradually
filling
the
glade
and
spreading
out
afar
beneath
the
trees
late
arrivals
were
still
coming
up
a
flood
of
heads
drowned
in
shadow
and
stretching
as
far
as
the
neighbouring
copses
a
rumbling
arose
from
them
like
that
of
a
storm
in
this
motionless
and
frozen
forest
at
the
top
dominating
the
slope
étienne
stood
with
rasseneur
and
maheu
a
quarrel
had
broken
out
one
could
hear
their
voices
in
sudden
bursts
near
them
some
men
were
listening
levaque
with
clenched
fists
pierron
turning
his
back
and
much
annoyed
that
he
had
no
longer
been
able
to
feign
a
fever
there
were
also
father
bonnemort
and
old
mouque
seated
side
by
side
on
a
stump
lost
in
deep
meditation
then
behind
were
the
chaffers
zacharie
mouquet
and
others
who
had
come
to
make
fun
of
the
thing
while
gathered
together
in
a
very
different
spirit
the
women
in
a
group
were
as
serious
as
if
at
church
maheude
silently
shook
her
head
at
the
levaque
muttered
oaths
philoméne
was
coughing
her
bronchitis
having
come
back
with
the
winter
only
mouquette
was
showing
her
teeth
with
laughter
amused
at
the
way
in
which
mother
brulé
was
abusing
her
daughter
an
unnatural
creature
who
had
sent
her
away
that
she
might
gorge
herself
with
rabbit
a
creature
who
had
sold
herself
and
who
fattened
on
her
man
cowardice
and
jeanlin
had
planted
himself
on
the
pile
of
wood
hoisting
up
lydie
and
making
bébert
follow
him
all
three
higher
up
in
the
air
than
any
one
else
the
quarrel
was
raised
by
rasseneur
who
wished
to
proceed
formally
to
the
election
of
officers
he
was
enraged
by
his
defeat
at
the
and
had
sworn
to
have
his
revenge
for
he
flattered
himself
that
he
could
regain
his
old
authority
when
he
was
once
face
to
face
not
with
the
delegates
but
with
the
miners
themselves
étienne
was
disgusted
and
thought
the
idea
of
officers
was
ridiculous
in
this
forest
they
ought
to
act
in
a
revolutionary
fashion
like
savages
since
they
were
tracked
like
wolves
as
the
dispute
threatened
to
drag
on
he
took
possession
of
the
crowd
at
once
by
jumping
on
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
shouting
comrades
comrades
the
confused
roar
of
the
crowd
died
down
into
a
long
sigh
while
maheu
stifled
rasseneur
protestations
étienne
went
on
in
a
loud
voice
comrades
since
they
forbid
us
to
speak
since
they
send
the
police
after
us
as
if
we
were
robbers
we
have
come
to
talk
here
here
we
are
free
we
are
at
home
no
one
can
silence
us
any
more
than
they
can
silence
the
birds
and
beasts
a
thunder
of
cries
and
exclamations
responded
to
him
yes
yes
the
forest
is
ours
we
can
talk
here
go
on
then
étienne
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
on
the
the
moon
still
beneath
the
horizon
only
lit
up
the
topmost
branches
and
the
crowd
remaining
in
the
darkness
stood
above
it
at
the
top
of
the
slope
like
a
bar
of
shadow
he
raised
his
arm
with
a
slow
movement
and
began
but
his
voice
was
not
fierce
he
spoke
in
the
cold
tones
of
a
simple
envoy
of
the
people
who
was
rendering
his
account
he
was
delivering
the
discourse
which
the
commissioner
of
police
had
cut
short
at
the
and
he
began
by
a
rapid
history
of
the
strike
affecting
a
certain
scientific
eloquence
facts
nothing
but
facts
at
first
he
spoke
of
his
dislike
to
the
strike
the
miners
had
not
desired
it
it
was
the
management
which
had
provoked
it
with
the
new
timbering
tariff
then
he
recalled
the
first
step
taken
by
the
delegates
in
going
to
the
manager
the
bad
faith
of
the
directors
and
later
on
the
second
step
the
tardy
concession
the
ten
centimes
given
up
after
the
attempt
to
rob
them
now
he
showed
by
figures
the
exhaustion
of
the
provident
fund
and
pointed
out
the
use
that
had
been
made
of
the
help
sent
briefly
excusing
the
international
pluchart
and
the
others
for
not
being
able
to
do
more
for
them
in
the
midst
of
the
cares
of
their
conquest
of
the
world
so
the
situation
was
getting
worse
every
day
the
company
was
giving
back
certificates
and
threatening
to
hire
men
from
belgium
besides
it
was
intimidating
the
weak
and
had
forced
a
certain
number
of
miners
to
go
down
again
he
preserved
his
monotonous
voice
as
if
to
insist
on
the
bad
news
he
said
that
hunger
was
victorious
that
hope
was
dead
and
that
the
struggle
had
reached
the
last
feverish
efforts
of
courage
and
then
he
suddenly
concluded
without
raising
his
voice
it
is
in
these
circumstances
mates
that
you
have
to
take
a
decision
do
you
want
the
strike
to
go
on
and
if
so
what
do
you
expect
to
do
to
beat
the
company
a
deep
silence
fell
from
the
starry
sky
the
crowd
which
could
not
be
seen
was
silent
in
the
night
beneath
these
words
which
choked
every
heart
and
a
sigh
of
despair
could
be
heard
through
the
trees
but
étienne
was
already
continuing
with
a
change
in
his
voice
it
was
no
longer
the
secretary
of
the
association
who
was
speaking
it
was
the
chief
of
a
band
the
apostle
who
was
bringing
truth
could
it
be
that
any
were
cowardly
enough
to
go
back
on
their
word
what
they
were
to
suffer
in
vain
for
a
month
and
then
to
go
back
to
the
pits
with
lowered
heads
so
that
the
everlasting
wretchedness
might
begin
over
again
would
it
not
be
better
to
die
at
once
in
the
effort
to
destroy
this
tyranny
of
capital
which
was
starving
the
worker
always
to
submit
to
hunger
up
to
the
moment
when
hunger
will
again
throw
the
calmest
into
revolt
was
it
not
a
foolish
game
which
could
not
go
on
for
ever
and
he
pointed
to
the
exploited
miners
bearing
alone
the
disasters
of
every
crisis
reduced
to
go
without
food
as
soon
as
the
necessities
of
competition
lowered
net
prices
no
the
timbering
tariff
could
not
be
accepted
it
was
only
a
disguised
effort
to
economize
on
the
company
part
they
wanted
to
rob
every
man
of
an
hour
work
a
day
it
was
too
much
this
time
the
day
was
coming
when
the
miserable
pushed
to
extremity
would
deal
justice
he
stood
with
his
arms
in
the
air
at
the
word
justice
the
crowd
shaken
by
a
long
shudder
broke
out
into
applause
which
rolled
along
with
the
sound
of
dry
leaves
voices
cried
justice
it
is
time
justice
gradually
étienne
grew
heated
he
had
not
rasseneur
easy
flowing
abundance
words
often
failed
him
he
had
to
force
his
phrases
bringing
them
out
with
an
effort
which
he
emphasized
by
a
movement
of
his
shoulders
only
in
these
continual
shocks
he
came
upon
familiar
images
which
seized
on
his
audience
by
their
energy
while
his
workman
gestures
his
elbows
in
and
then
extended
with
his
fists
thrust
out
his
jaw
suddenly
advanced
as
if
to
bite
had
also
an
extraordinary
effect
on
his
mates
they
all
said
that
if
he
was
not
big
he
made
himself
heard
the
wage
system
is
a
new
form
of
slavery
he
began
again
in
a
more
sonorous
voice
the
mine
ought
to
belong
to
the
miner
as
the
sea
belongs
to
the
fisherman
and
the
earth
to
the
peasant
do
you
see
the
mine
belongs
to
you
to
all
of
you
who
for
a
century
have
paid
for
it
with
so
much
blood
and
misery
he
boldly
entered
on
obscure
questions
of
law
and
lost
himself
in
the
difficulties
of
the
special
regulations
concerning
mines
the
subsoil
like
the
soil
belonged
to
the
nation
only
an
odious
privilege
gave
the
monopoly
of
it
to
the
companies
all
the
more
since
at
montsou
the
pretended
legality
of
the
concession
was
complicated
by
treaties
formerly
made
with
the
owners
of
the
old
fiefs
according
to
the
ancient
custom
of
hainault
the
miners
then
had
only
to
reconquer
their
property
and
with
extended
hands
he
indicated
the
whole
country
beyond
the
forest
at
this
moment
the
moon
which
had
risen
above
the
horizon
lit
him
up
as
it
glided
from
behind
the
high
branches
when
the
crowd
which
was
still
in
shadow
saw
him
thus
white
with
light
distributing
fortune
with
his
open
hands
they
applauded
anew
by
prolonged
clapping
yes
yes
he
right
bravo
then
étienne
trotted
out
his
favourite
subject
the
assumption
of
the
instruments
of
production
by
the
collectivity
as
he
kept
on
saying
in
a
phrase
the
pedantry
of
which
greatly
pleased
him
at
the
present
time
his
evolution
was
completed
having
set
out
with
the
sentimental
fraternity
of
the
novice
and
the
need
for
reforming
the
wage
system
he
had
reached
the
political
idea
of
its
suppression
since
the
meeting
at
the
his
collectivism
still
humanitarian
and
without
a
formula
had
stiffened
into
a
complicated
programme
which
he
discussed
scientifically
article
by
article
first
he
affirmed
that
freedom
could
only
be
obtained
by
the
destruction
of
the
state
then
when
the
people
had
obtained
possession
of
the
government
reforms
would
begin
return
to
the
primitive
commune
substitution
of
an
equal
and
free
family
for
the
moral
and
oppressive
family
absolute
equality
civil
political
and
economic
individual
independence
guaranteed
thanks
to
the
possession
of
the
integral
product
of
the
instruments
of
work
finally
free
vocational
education
paid
for
by
the
collectivity
this
led
to
the
total
reconstruction
of
the
old
rotten
society
he
attacked
marriage
the
right
of
bequest
he
regulated
every
one
fortune
he
threw
down
the
iniquitous
monument
of
the
dead
centuries
with
a
great
movement
of
his
arm
always
the
same
movement
the
movement
of
the
reaper
who
is
cutting
down
a
ripe
harvest
and
then
with
the
other
hand
he
reconstructed
he
built
up
the
future
humanity
the
edifice
of
truth
and
justice
rising
in
the
dawn
of
the
twentieth
century
in
this
state
of
mental
tension
reason
trembled
and
only
the
sectarian
fixed
idea
was
left
the
scruples
of
sensibility
and
of
good
sense
were
lost
nothing
seemed
easier
than
the
realization
of
this
new
world
he
had
foreseen
everything
he
spoke
of
it
as
of
a
machine
which
he
could
put
together
in
two
hours
and
he
stuck
at
neither
fire
nor
blood
our
turn
is
come
he
broke
out
for
the
last
time
now
it
is
for
us
to
have
power
and
wealth
the
cheering
rolled
up
to
him
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
the
moon
now
whitened
the
whole
of
the
glade
and
cut
into
living
waves
the
sea
of
heads
as
far
as
the
dimly
visible
copses
in
the
distance
between
the
great
grey
trunks
and
in
the
icy
air
there
was
a
fury
of
faces
of
gleaming
eyes
of
open
mouths
a
rut
of
famishing
men
women
and
children
let
loose
on
the
just
pillage
of
the
ancient
wealth
they
had
been
deprived
of
they
no
longer
felt
the
cold
these
burning
words
had
warmed
them
to
the
bone
religious
exaltation
raised
them
from
the
earth
a
fever
of
hope
like
that
of
the
christians
of
the
early
church
awaiting
the
near
coming
of
justice
many
obscure
phrases
had
escaped
them
they
could
not
properly
understand
this
technical
and
abstract
reasoning
but
the
very
obscurity
and
abstraction
still
further
enlarged
the
field
of
promises
and
lifted
them
into
a
dazzling
region
what
a
dream
to
be
masters
to
suffer
no
more
to
enjoy
at
last
that
it
by
god
it
our
turn
now
down
with
the
exploiters
the
women
were
delirious
maheude
losing
her
calmness
was
seized
with
the
vertigo
of
hunger
the
levaque
woman
shouted
old
brulé
carried
out
of
herself
was
brandishing
her
arms
philoméne
was
shaken
by
a
spasm
of
coughing
and
mouquette
was
so
excited
that
she
cried
out
words
of
tenderness
to
the
orator
among
the
men
maheu
was
won
over
and
shouted
with
anger
between
pierron
who
was
trembling
and
levaque
who
was
talking
too
much
while
the
chaffers
zacharie
and
mouquet
though
trying
to
make
fun
of
things
were
feeling
uncomfortable
and
were
surprised
that
their
mate
could
talk
on
so
long
without
having
a
drink
but
on
top
of
the
pile
of
wood
jeanlin
was
making
more
noise
than
any
one
egging
on
bébert
and
lydie
and
shaking
the
basket
in
which
poland
lay
the
clamour
began
again
étienne
was
enjoying
the
intoxication
of
his
popularity
he
held
power
as
it
were
materialized
in
these
three
thousand
breasts
whose
hearts
he
could
move
with
a
word
souvarine
if
he
had
cared
to
come
would
have
applauded
his
ideas
so
far
as
he
recognized
them
pleased
with
his
pupil
progress
in
anarchism
and
satisfied
with
the
programme
except
the
article
on
education
a
relic
of
silly
sentimentality
for
men
needed
to
be
dipped
in
a
bath
of
holy
and
salutary
ignorance
as
to
rasseneur
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
contempt
and
anger
you
shall
let
me
speak
he
shouted
to
étienne
the
latter
jumped
from
the
speak
we
shall
see
if
they
hear
you
already
rasseneur
had
replaced
him
and
with
a
gesture
demanded
silence
but
the
noise
did
not
cease
his
name
went
round
from
the
first
ranks
who
had
recognized
him
to
the
last
lost
beneath
the
beeches
and
they
refused
to
hear
him
he
was
an
overturned
idol
the
mere
sight
of
him
angered
his
old
disciples
his
facile
elocution
his
flowing
speech
which
had
so
long
charmed
them
was
now
treated
like
warm
gruel
made
to
put
cowards
to
sleep
in
vain
he
talked
through
the
noise
trying
to
take
up
again
his
discourse
of
conciliation
the
impossibility
of
changing
the
world
by
a
stroke
of
law
the
necessity
of
allowing
the
social
evolution
time
to
accomplish
itself
they
joked
him
they
hissed
him
his
defeat
at
the
was
now
beyond
repair
at
last
they
threw
handfuls
of
frozen
moss
at
him
and
a
woman
cried
in
a
shrill
voice
down
with
the
traitor
he
explained
that
the
miner
could
not
be
the
proprietor
of
the
mine
as
the
weaver
is
of
his
loom
and
he
said
that
he
preferred
sharing
in
the
benefits
the
interested
worker
becoming
the
child
of
the
house
down
with
the
traitor
repeated
a
thousand
voices
while
stones
began
to
whistle
by
then
he
turned
pale
and
despair
filled
his
eyes
with
tears
his
whole
existence
was
crumbling
down
twenty
years
of
ambitious
comradeship
were
breaking
down
beneath
the
ingratitude
of
the
crowd
he
came
down
from
the
with
no
strength
to
go
on
struck
to
the
heart
that
makes
you
laugh
he
stammered
addressing
the
triumphant
étienne
good
i
hope
your
turn
will
come
it
will
come
i
tell
you
and
as
if
to
reject
all
responsibility
for
the
evils
which
he
foresaw
he
made
a
large
gesture
and
went
away
alone
across
the
country
pale
and
silent
hoots
arose
and
then
they
were
surprised
to
see
father
bonnemort
standing
on
the
trunk
and
about
to
speak
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
up
till
now
mouque
and
he
had
remained
absorbed
with
that
air
that
they
always
had
of
reflecting
on
former
things
no
doubt
he
was
yielding
to
one
of
those
sudden
crises
of
garrulity
which
sometimes
made
the
past
stir
in
him
so
violently
that
recollections
rose
and
flowed
from
his
lips
for
hours
at
a
time
there
was
deep
silence
and
they
listened
to
this
old
man
who
was
like
a
pale
spectre
beneath
the
moon
and
as
he
narrated
things
without
any
immediate
relation
with
the
discussion
long
histories
which
no
one
could
understand
the
impression
was
increased
he
was
talking
of
his
youth
he
described
the
death
of
his
two
uncles
who
were
crushed
at
the
voreux
then
he
turned
to
the
inflammation
of
the
lungs
which
had
carried
off
his
wife
he
kept
to
his
main
idea
however
things
had
never
gone
well
and
never
would
go
well
thus
in
the
forest
five
hundred
of
them
had
come
together
because
the
king
would
not
lessen
the
hours
of
work
but
he
stopped
short
and
began
to
tell
of
another
strike
he
had
seen
so
many
they
all
broke
out
under
these
trees
here
at
the
lower
down
at
the
charbonnerie
still
farther
towards
the
sometimes
it
froze
sometimes
it
was
hot
one
evening
it
had
rained
so
much
that
they
had
gone
back
again
without
being
able
to
say
anything
and
the
king
soldiers
came
up
and
it
finished
with
volleys
of
musketry
we
raised
our
hands
like
this
and
we
swore
not
to
go
back
again
ah
i
have
sworn
yes
i
have
sworn
the
crowd
listened
gapingly
feeling
disturbed
when
étienne
who
had
watched
the
scene
jumped
on
to
the
fallen
tree
keeping
the
old
man
at
his
side
he
had
just
recognized
chaval
among
their
friends
in
the
first
row
the
idea
that
catherine
must
be
there
had
roused
a
new
ardour
within
him
the
desire
to
be
applauded
in
her
presence
mates
you
have
heard
this
is
one
of
our
old
men
and
this
is
what
he
has
suffered
and
what
our
children
will
suffer
if
we
do
have
done
with
the
robbers
and
butchers
he
was
terrible
never
had
he
spoken
so
violently
with
one
arm
he
supported
old
bonnemort
exhibiting
him
as
a
banner
of
misery
and
mourning
and
crying
for
vengeance
in
a
few
rapid
phrases
he
went
back
to
the
first
maheu
he
showed
the
whole
family
used
up
at
the
mine
devoured
by
the
company
hungrier
than
ever
after
a
hundred
years
of
work
and
contrasting
with
the
maheus
he
pointed
to
the
big
bellies
of
the
directors
sweating
gold
a
whole
band
of
shareholders
going
on
for
a
century
like
kept
women
doing
nothing
but
enjoy
with
their
bodies
was
it
not
fearful
a
race
of
men
dying
down
below
from
father
to
son
so
that
bribes
of
wine
could
be
given
to
ministers
and
generations
of
great
lords
and
bourgeois
could
give
feasts
or
fatten
by
their
firesides
he
had
studied
the
diseases
of
the
miners
he
made
them
all
march
past
with
their
awful
details
anaemia
scrofula
black
bronchitis
the
asthma
which
chokes
and
the
rheumatism
which
paralyses
these
wretches
were
thrown
as
food
to
the
engines
and
penned
up
like
beasts
in
the
settlements
the
great
companies
absorbed
them
regulating
their
slavery
threatening
to
enrol
all
the
workers
of
the
nation
millions
of
hands
to
bring
fortune
to
a
thousand
idlers
but
the
miner
was
no
longer
an
ignorant
brute
crushed
within
the
bowels
of
the
earth
an
army
was
springing
up
from
the
depths
of
the
pits
a
harvest
of
citizens
whose
seed
would
germinate
and
burst
through
the
earth
some
sunny
day
and
they
would
see
then
if
after
forty
years
of
service
any
one
would
dare
to
offer
a
pension
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
to
an
old
man
of
sixty
who
spat
out
coal
and
whose
legs
were
swollen
with
the
water
from
the
cuttings
yes
labour
would
demand
an
account
from
capital
that
impersonal
god
unknown
to
the
worker
crouching
down
somewhere
in
his
mysterious
sanctuary
where
he
sucked
the
life
out
of
the
starvelings
who
nourished
him
they
would
go
down
there
they
would
at
last
succeed
in
seeing
his
face
by
the
gleam
of
incendiary
fires
they
would
drown
him
in
blood
that
filthy
swine
that
monstrous
idol
gorged
with
human
flesh
he
was
silent
but
his
arm
still
extended
in
space
indicated
the
enemy
down
there
he
knew
not
where
from
one
end
of
the
earth
to
the
other
this
time
the
clamour
of
the
crowd
was
so
great
that
people
at
montsou
heard
it
and
looked
towards
vandame
seized
with
anxiety
at
the
thought
that
some
terrible
landslip
had
occurred
rose
above
the
trees
in
the
clear
open
sky
he
now
concluded
his
speech
mates
what
is
your
decision
do
you
vote
for
the
strike
to
go
on
their
voices
yelled
yes
yes
and
what
steps
do
you
decide
on
we
are
sure
of
defeat
if
cowards
go
down
their
voices
rose
again
with
the
sound
of
a
tempest
kill
the
cowards
then
you
decide
to
call
them
back
to
duty
and
to
their
sworn
word
this
is
what
we
could
do
present
ourselves
at
the
pits
bring
back
the
traitors
by
our
presence
show
the
company
that
we
are
all
agreed
and
that
we
are
going
to
die
rather
than
yield
that
it
to
the
pits
to
the
pits
while
he
was
speaking
étienne
had
looked
for
catherine
among
the
pale
shouting
heads
before
him
she
was
certainly
not
there
but
he
still
saw
chaval
affecting
to
jeer
shrugging
his
shoulders
but
devoured
by
jealousy
and
ready
to
sell
himself
for
a
little
of
this
popularity
and
if
there
are
any
spies
among
us
mates
étienne
went
on
let
them
look
out
they
known
yes
i
can
see
vandame
colliers
here
who
have
not
left
their
pit
is
that
meant
for
me
asked
chaval
with
an
air
of
bravado
for
you
or
for
any
one
else
but
since
you
speak
you
ought
to
understand
that
those
who
eat
have
nothing
to
do
with
those
who
are
starving
you
work
at
a
chaffing
voice
interrupted
oh
he
work
he
got
a
wife
who
works
for
him
chaval
swore
while
the
blood
rose
to
his
face
by
god
is
it
forbidden
to
work
then
yes
said
étienne
when
your
mates
are
enduring
misery
for
the
good
of
all
it
is
forbidden
to
go
over
like
a
selfish
sneaking
coward
to
the
masters
side
if
the
strike
had
been
general
we
should
have
got
the
best
of
it
long
ago
not
a
single
man
at
vandame
ought
to
have
gone
down
when
montsou
is
resting
to
accomplish
the
great
stroke
work
should
be
stopped
in
the
entire
country
at
monsieur
deneulin
as
well
as
here
do
you
understand
there
are
only
traitors
in
the
jean
bart
cuttings
you
all
traitors
the
crowd
around
chaval
grew
threatening
and
fists
were
raised
and
cries
of
kill
him
kill
him
began
to
be
uttered
he
had
grown
pale
but
in
his
infuriated
desire
to
triumph
over
étienne
an
idea
restored
him
listen
to
me
then
come
to
and
you
shall
see
if
i
working
we
on
your
side
they
sent
me
to
tell
you
so
the
fires
must
be
extinguished
and
the
too
must
go
on
strike
all
the
better
if
the
pumps
do
stop
the
water
will
destroy
the
pits
and
everything
will
be
done
for
he
was
furiously
applauded
in
his
turn
and
now
étienne
himself
was
outflanked
other
orators
succeeded
each
other
from
the
gesticulating
amid
the
tumult
and
throwing
out
wild
propositions
it
was
a
mad
outburst
of
faith
the
impatience
of
a
religious
sect
which
tired
of
hoping
for
the
expected
miracle
had
at
last
decided
to
provoke
it
these
heads
emptied
by
famine
saw
everything
red
and
dreamed
of
fire
and
blood
in
the
midst
of
a
glorious
apotheosis
from
which
would
arise
universal
happiness
and
the
tranquil
moon
bathed
this
surging
sea
the
deep
forest
encircled
with
its
vast
silence
this
cry
of
massacre
the
frozen
moss
crackled
beneath
the
heels
of
the
crowd
while
the
beeches
erect
in
their
strength
with
the
delicate
tracery
of
their
black
branches
against
the
white
sky
neither
saw
nor
heard
the
miserable
beings
who
writhed
at
their
feet
there
was
some
pushing
and
maheude
found
herself
near
maheu
both
of
them
driven
out
of
their
ordinary
good
sense
and
carried
away
by
the
slow
exasperation
which
had
been
working
within
them
for
months
approved
levaque
who
went
to
extremes
by
demanding
the
heads
of
the
engineers
pierron
had
disappeared
bonnemort
and
mouque
were
both
talking
together
saying
vague
violent
things
which
nobody
heard
for
a
joke
zacharie
demanded
the
demolition
of
the
churches
while
mouquet
with
his
crosse
in
his
hand
was
beating
it
against
the
ground
for
the
sake
of
increasing
the
row
the
women
were
furious
the
levaque
with
her
fists
to
her
hips
was
setting
to
with
philoméne
whom
she
accused
of
having
laughed
mouquette
talked
of
attacking
the
gendarmes
by
kicking
them
somewhere
mother
brulé
who
had
just
slapped

on
finding
her
without
either

went
on
launching
blows
into

against
all
the

she
would
like
to
have
got
at
for
a
moment
jeanlin
was
in
terror
bébert
having
learned
through
a
trammer
that
madame
rasseneur
had
seen
them
steal
poland
but
when
he
had
decided
to
go
back
and
quietly
release
the
beast
at
the
door
of
the
avantage
he
shouted
louder
than
ever
and
opened
his
new
knife
brandishing
the
blade
and
proud
of
its
glitter
mates
mates
repeated
the
exhausted
étienne
hoarse
with
the
effort
to
obtain
a
moment
silence
for
a
definite
understanding
at
last
they
listened
mates
morning
at
is
it
agreed
yes
yes
at
death
to
the
traitors
the
tempest
of
these
three
thousand
voices
filled
the
sky
and
died
away
in
the
pure
brightness
of
the
moon
part
five
chapter
i
at
four
the
moon
had
set
and
the
night
was
very
dark
everything
was
still
asleep
at
deneulin
the
old
brick
house
stood
mute
and
gloomy
with
closed
doors
and
windows
at
the
end
of
the
large
garden
which
separated
it
from
the
mine
the
other
frontage
faced
the
deserted
road
to
vandame
a
large
country
town
about
three
kilometres
off
hidden
behind
the
forest
deneulin
tired
after
a
day
spent
in
part
below
was
snoring
with
his
face
toward
the
wall
when
he
dreamt
that
he
had
been
called
at
last
he
awoke
and
really
hearing
a
voice
got
out
and
opened
the
window
one
of
his
captains
was
in
the
garden
what
is
it
then
he
asked
there
a
rebellion
sir
half
the
men
will
not
work
and
are
preventing
the
others
from
going
down
he
scarcely
understood
with
head
heavy
and
dazed
with
sleep
and
the
great
cold
struck
him
like
an
icy
douche
then
make
them
go
down
by
george
he
stammered
it
been
going
on
an
hour
said
the
captain
then
we
thought
it
best
to
come
for
you
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
persuade
them
very
good
i
go
he
quickly
dressed
himself
his
mind
quite
clear
now
and
very
anxious
the
house
might
have
been
pillaged
neither
the
cook
nor
the
had
stirred
but
from
the
other
side
of
the
staircase
alarmed
voices
were
whispering
and
when
he
came
out
he
saw
his
daughters
door
open
and
they
both
appeared
in
white
slipped
on
in
haste
father
what
is
it
lucie
the
elder
was
already
a
tall
dark
girl
with
a
haughty
air
while
jeanne
the
younger
as
yet
scarcely
nineteen
years
old
was
small
with
golden
hair
and
a
certain
caressing
grace
nothing
serious
he
replied
to
reassure
them
it
seems
that
some
blusterers
are
making
a
disturbance
down
there
i
am
going
to
see
but
they
exclaimed
that
they
would
not
let
him
go
before
he
had
taken
something
warm
if
not
he
would
come
back
ill
with
his
stomach
out
of
order
as
he
always
did
he
struggled
gave
his
word
of
honour
that
he
was
too
much
in
a
hurry
listen
said
jeanne
at
last
hanging
to
his
neck
you
must
drink
a
little
glass
of
rum
and
eat
two
biscuits
or
i
shall
remain
like
this
and
you
have
to
take
me
with
you
he
resigned
himself
declaring
that
the
biscuits
would
choke
him
they
had
already
gone
down
before
him
each
with
her
candlestick
in
the
below
they
hastened
to
serve
him
one
pouring
out
the
rum
the
other
running
to
the
pantry
for
the
biscuits
having
lost
their
mother
when
very
young
they
had
been
rather
badly
brought
up
alone
spoilt
by
their
father
the
elder
haunted
by
the
dream
of
singing
on
the
stage
the
younger
mad
over
painting
in
which
she
showed
a
singular
boldness
of
taste
but
when
they
had
to
retrench
after
the
embarrassment
in
their
affairs
these
apparently
extravagant
girls
had
suddenly
developed
into
very
sensible
and
shrewd
managers
with
an
eye
for
errors
of
centimes
in
accounts
today
with
their
boyish
and
artistic
demeanour
they
kept
the
purse
were
careful
over
sous
haggled
with
the
tradesmen
renovated
their
dresses
unceasingly
and
in
fact
succeeded
in
rendering
decent
the
growing
embarrassment
of
the
house
eat
papa
repeated
lucie
then
remarking
his
silent
gloomy
preoccupation
she
was
again
frightened
is
it
serious
then
that
you
look
at
us
like
this
tell
us
we
will
stay
with
you
and
they
can
do
without
us
at
that
lunch
she
was
speaking
of
a
party
which
had
been
planned
for
the
morning
madame
hennebeau
was
to
go
in
her
carriage
first
for
cécile
at
the
grégoires
then
to
call
for
them
so
that
they
could
all
go
to
marchiennes
to
lunch
at
the
forges
where
the
manager
wife
had
invited
them
it
was
an
opportunity
to
visit
the
workshops
the
blast
furnaces
and
the
coke
ovens
we
will
certainly
remain
declared
jeanne
in
her
turn
but
he
grew
angry
a
fine
idea
i
tell
you
that
it
is
nothing
just
be
so
good
as
to
get
back
into
your
beds
again
and
dress
yourselves
for
nine
as
was
arranged
he
kissed
them
and
hastened
to
leave
they
heard
the
noise
of
his
boots
vanishing
over
the
frozen
earth
in
the
garden
jeanne
carefully
placed
the
stopper
in
the
rum
bottle
while
lucie
locked
up
the
biscuits
the
room
had
the
cold
neatness
of
where
the
table
is
but
meagrely
supplied
and
both
of
them
took
advantage
of
this
early
descent
to
see
if
anything
had
been
left
uncared
for
the
evening
before
a
serviette
lay
about
the
servant
should
be
scolded
at
last
they
were
upstairs
again
while
he
was
taking
the
shortest
cut
through
the
narrow
paths
of
his
kitchen
garden
deneulin
was
thinking
of
his
compromised
fortune
this
montsou
denier
this
million
which
he
had
realized
dreaming
to
multiply
it
tenfold
and
which
was
running
such
great
risks
it
was
an
uninterrupted
course
of
enormous
and
unforeseen
repairs
ruinous
conditions
of
exploitation
then
the
disaster
of
this
industrial
crisis
just
when
the
profits
were
beginning
to
come
in
if
the
strike
broke
out
here
he
would
be
overthrown
he
pushed
a
little
door
the
buildings
of
the
pit
could
be
divined
in
the
black
night
by
the
deepening
of
the
shadow
starred
by
a
few
lanterns
was
not
so
important
as
the
voreux
but
its
renewed
installation
made
it
a
pretty
pit
as
the
engineers
say
they
had
not
been
contented
by
enlarging
the
shaft
one
metre
and
a
half
and
deepening
it
to
seven
hundred
and
eight
metres
they
had
equipped
it
afresh
with
a
new
engine
new
cages
entirely
new
material
all
set
up
according
to
the
latest
scientific
improvements
and
even
a
certain
seeking
for
elegance
was
visible
in
the
constructions
a
with
carved
frieze
a
steeple
adorned
with
a
clock
a
and
an
both
rounded
into
an
apse
like
a
renaissance
chapel
and
surmounted
by
a
chimney
with
a
mosaic
spiral
made
of
black
bricks
and
red
bricks
the
pump
was
placed
on
the
other
shaft
of
the
concession
the
old
pit
reserved
solely
for
this
purpose
to
right
and
left
of
the
only
had
two
conduits
that
for
the
steam
ventilator
and
that
for
the
ladders
in
the
morning
ever
since
three
chaval
who
had
arrived
first
had
been
seducing
his
comrades
convincing
them
that
they
ought
to
imitate
those
at
montsou
and
demand
an
increase
of
five
centimes
a
tram
soon
four
hundred
workmen
had
passed
from
the
shed
into
the
in
the
midst
of
a
tumult
of
gesticulation
and
shouting
those
who
wished
to
work
stood
with
their
lamps
barefooted
with
shovel
or
pick
beneath
their
arms
while
the
others
still
in
their
sabots
with
their
overcoats
on
their
shoulders
because
of
the
great
cold
were
barring
the
shaft
and
the
captains
were
growing
hoarse
in
the
effort
to
restore
order
begging
them
to
be
reasonable
and
not
to
prevent
those
who
wanted
from
going
down
but
chaval
was
furious
when
he
saw
catherine
in
her
trousers
and
jacket
her
head
tied
up
in
the
blue
cap
on
getting
up
he
had
roughly
told
her
to
stay
in
bed
in
despair
at
this
arrest
of
work
she
had
followed
him
all
the
same
for
he
never
gave
her
any
money
she
often
had
to
pay
both
for
herself
and
him
and
what
was
to
become
of
her
if
she
earned
nothing
she
was
overcome
by
fear
the
fear
of
a
brothel
at
marchiennes
which
was
the
end
of
without
bread
and
without
lodging
by
god
cried
chaval
what
the
devil
have
you
come
here
for
she
stammered
that
she
had
no
income
to
live
on
and
that
she
wanted
to
work
then
you
put
yourself
against
me
wench
back
you
go
at
once
or
go
back
with
you
and
kick
my
sabots
into
your
backside
she
recoiled
timidly
but
she
did
not
leave
resolved
to
see
how
things
would
turn
out
deneulin
had
arrived
by
the
in
spite
of
the
weak
light
of
the
lanterns
with
a
quick
look
he
took
in
the
scene
with
this
rabble
wrapt
in
shadow
he
knew
every
face
the
pikemen
the
porters
the
landers
the
putters
even
the
trammers
in
the
nave
still
new
and
clean
the
arrested
task
was
waiting
the
steam
in
the
engine
under
pressure
made
slight
whistling
sounds
the
cages
were
hanging
motionless
to
the
cables
the
trams
abandoned
on
the
way
were
encumbering
the
metal
floors
scarcely
eighty
lamps
had
been
taken
the
others
were
flaming
in
the
lamp
cabin
but
no
doubt
a
word
from
him
would
suffice
and
the
whole
life
of
labour
would
begin
again
well
what
going
on
then
my
lads
he
asked
in
a
loud
voice
what
are
you
angry
about
just
explain
to
me
and
we
will
see
if
we
can
agree
he
usually
behaved
in
a
paternal
way
towards
his
men
while
at
the
same
time
demanding
hard
work
with
an
authoritative
rough
manner
he
had
tried
to
conquer
them
by
a
good
nature
which
had
its
outbursts
of
passion
and
he
often
gained
their
love
the
men
especially
respected
in
him
his
courage
always
in
the
cuttings
with
them
the
first
in
danger
whenever
an
accident
terrified
the
pit
twice
after
explosions
he
had
been
let
down
fastened
by
a
rope
under
his
armpits
when
the
bravest
drew
back
now
he
began
again
you
are
not
going
to
make
me
repent
of
having
trusted
you
you
know
that
i
have
refused
police
protection
talk
quietly
and
i
will
hear
you
all
were
now
silent
and
awkward
moving
away
from
him
and
it
was
chaval
who
at
last
said
well
monsieur
deneulin
we
ca
go
on
working
we
must
have
five
centimes
more
the
tram
he
seemed
surprised
what
five
centimes
and
why
this
demand
i
do
complain
about
your
timbering
i
do
want
to
impose
a
new
tariff
on
you
like
the
montsou
directors
maybe
but
the
montsou
mates
are
right
all
the
same
they
wo
have
the
tariff
and
they
want
a
rise
of
five
centimes
because
it
is
not
possible
to
work
properly
at
the
present
rates
we
want
five
centimes
more
do
we
you
others
voices
approved
and
the
noise
began
again
in
the
midst
of
violent
gesticulation
gradually
they
drew
near
forming
a
small
circle
a
flame
came
into
deneulin
eyes
and
his
fist
that
of
a
man
who
liked
strong
government
was
clenched
for
fear
of
yielding
to
the
temptation
of
seizing
one
of
them
by
the
neck
he
preferred
to
discuss
on
the
basis
of
reason
you
want
five
centimes
and
i
agree
that
the
work
is
worth
it
only
i
ca
give
it
if
i
gave
it
i
should
simply
be
done
for
you
must
understand
that
i
have
to
live
first
in
order
for
you
to
live
and
i
got
to
the
end
the
least
rise
in
net
prices
will
upset
me
two
years
ago
you
remember
at
the
time
of
the
last
strike
i
yielded
i
was
able
to
then
but
that
rise
of
wages
was
not
the
less
ruinous
for
these
two
years
have
been
a
struggle
i
would
rather
let
the
whole
thing
go
than
not
be
able
to
tell
next
month
where
to
get
the
money
to
pay
you
chaval
laughed
roughly
in
the
face
of
this
master
who
told
them
his
affairs
so
frankly
the
others
lowered
their
faces
obstinate
and
incredulous
refusing
to
take
into
their
heads
the
idea
that
a
master
did
not
gain
millions
out
of
his
men
then
deneulin
persisting
explained
his
struggle
with
montsou
always
on
the
watch
and
ready
to
devour
him
if
some
day
he
had
the
stupidity
to
come
to
grief
it
was
a
savage
competition
which
forced
him
to
economize
the
more
so
since
the
great
depth
of
increased
the
price
of
extraction
an
unfavourable
condition
hardly
compensated
by
the
great
thickness
of
the
he
would
never
have
raised
wages
after
the
last
strike
if
it
had
not
been
necessary
for
him
to
imitate
montsou
for
fear
of
seeing
his
men
leave
him
and
he
threatened
them
with
the
morrow
a
fine
result
it
would
be
for
them
if
they
obliged
him
to
sell
to
pass
beneath
the
terrible
yoke
of
the
directors
he
did
not
sit
on
a
throne
far
away
in
an
unknown
sanctuary
he
was
not
one
of
those
shareholders
who
pay
agents
to
skin
the
miner
who
has
never
seen
them
he
was
a
master
he
risked
something
besides
his
money
he
risked
his
intelligence
his
health
his
life
stoppage
of
work
would
simply
mean
death
for
he
had
no
stock
and
he
must
fulfil
orders
besides
his
standing
capital
could
not
sleep
how
could
he
keep
his
engagements
who
would
pay
the
interest
on
the
sums
his
friends
had
confided
to
him
it
would
mean
bankruptcy
that
where
we
are
my
good
fellows
he
said
in
conclusion
i
want
to
convince
you
we
do
ask
a
man
to
cut
his
own
throat
do
we
and
if
i
give
you
your
five
centimes
or
if
i
let
you
go
out
on
strike
it
the
same
as
if
i
cut
my
throat
he
was
silent
grunts
went
round
a
party
among
the
miners
seemed
to
hesitate
several
went
back
towards
the
shaft
at
least
said
a
captain
let
every
one
be
free
who
are
those
who
want
to
work
catherine
had
advanced
among
the
first
but
chaval
fiercely
pushed
her
back
shouting
we
are
all
agreed
it
only
bloody
rogues
who
leave
their
mates
after
that
conciliation
appeared
impossible
the
cries
began
again
and
men
were
hustled
away
from
the
shaft
at
the
risk
of
being
crushed
against
the
walls
for
a
moment
the
manager
in
despair
tried
to
struggle
alone
to
reduce
the
crowd
by
violence
but
it
was
useless
madness
and
he
retired
for
a
few
minutes
he
rested
out
of
breath
on
a
chair
in
the
receiver
office
so
overcome
by
his
powerlessness
that
no
ideas
came
to
him
at
last
he
grew
calm
and
told
an
inspector
to
go
and
bring
chaval
then
when
the
latter
had
agreed
to
the
interview
he
motioned
the
others
away
leave
us
deneulin
idea
was
to
see
what
this
fellow
was
after
at
the
first
words
he
felt
that
he
was
vain
and
was
devoured
by
passionate
jealousy
then
he
attacked
him
by
flattery
affecting
surprise
that
a
workman
of
his
merit
should
so
compromise
his
future
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
long
had
his
eyes
on
him
for
rapid
advancement
and
he
ended
by
squarely
offering
to
make
him
captain
later
on
chaval
listened
in
silence
with
his
fists
at
first
clenched
but
then
gradually
unbent
something
was
working
in
the
depths
of
his
skull
if
he
persisted
in
the
strike
he
would
be
nothing
more
than
lieutenant
while
now
another
ambition
opened
that
of
passing
into
the
ranks
of
the
bosses
the
heat
of
pride
rose
to
his
face
and
intoxicated
him
besides
the
band
of
strikers
whom
he
had
expected
since
the
morning
had
not
arrived
some
obstacle
must
have
stopped
them
perhaps
the
police
it
was
time
to
submit
but
all
the
same
he
shook
his
head
he
acted
the
incorruptible
man
striking
his
breast
indignantly
then
without
mentioning
to
the
master
the
rendezvous
he
had
given
to
the
montsou
men
he
promised
to
calm
his
mates
and
to
persuade
them
to
go
down
deneulin
remained
hidden
and
the
captains
themselves
stood
aside
for
an
hour
they
heard
chaval
orating
and
discussing
standing
on
a
tram
in
the
some
of
the
men
hooted
him
a
hundred
and
twenty
went
off
exasperated
persisting
in
the
resolution
which
he
had
made
them
take
it
was
already
past
seven
the
sun
was
rising
brilliantly
it
was
a
bright
day
of
hard
frost
and
all
at
once
movement
began
in
the
pit
and
the
arrested
labour
went
on
first
the
crank
of
the
engine
plunged
rolling
and
unrolling
the
cables
on
the
drums
then
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
of
the
signals
the
descent
took
place
the
cages
filled
and
were
engulfed
and
rose
again
the
shaft
swallowing
its
ration
of
trammers
and
putters
and
pikemen
while
on
the
metal
floors
the
landers
pushed
the
trams
with
a
sound
of
thunder
by
god
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
there
cried
chaval
to
catherine
who
was
awaiting
her
turn
will
you
just
go
down
and
not
laze
about
at
nine
when
madame
hennebeau
arrived
in
her
carriage
with
cécile
she
found
lucie
and
jeanne
quite
ready
and
very
elegant
in
spite
of
their
dresses
having
been
renovated
for
the
twentieth
time
but
deneulin
was
surprised
to
see
négrel
accompanying
the
carriage
on
horseback
what
were
the
men
also
in
the
party
then
madame
hennebeau
explained
in
her
maternal
way
that
they
had
frightened
her
by
saying
that
the
streets
were
full
of
evil
faces
and
so
she
preferred
to
bring
a
defender
négrel
laughed
and
reassured
them
nothing
to
cause
anxiety
threats
of
brawlers
as
usual
but
not
one
of
them
would
dare
to
throw
a
stone
at
a
still
pleased
with
his
success
deneulin
related
the
checked
rebellion
at
he
said
that
he
was
now
quite
at
rest
and
on
the
vandame
road
while
the
young
ladies
got
into
the
carriage
all
congratulated
themselves
on
the
superb
day
oblivious
of
the
long
swelling
shudder
of
the
marching
people
afar
off
in
the
country
though
they
might
have
heard
the
sound
of
it
if
they
had
pressed
their
ears
against
the
earth
well
it
is
agreed
repeated
madame
hennebeau
this
evening
you
will
call
for
the
young
ladies
and
dine
with
us
madame
grégoire
has
also
promised
to
come
for
cécile
you
may
reckon
on
me
replied
deneulin
the
carriage
went
off
towards
vandame
jeanne
and
lucie
leaning
down
to
laugh
once
more
to
their
father
who
was
standing
by
the
roadside
while
négrel
gallantly
trotted
behind
the
fleeing
wheels
they
crossed
the
forest
taking
the
road
from
vandame
to
marchiennes
as
they
approached
tartaret
jeanne
asked
madame
hennebeau
if
she
knew
and
the
latter
in
spite
of
her
stay
of
five
years
in
the
country
acknowledged
that
she
had
never
been
on
that
side
then
they
made
a
detour
tartaret
on
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
was
an
uncultivated
moor
of
volcanic
sterility
under
which
for
ages
a
coal
mine
had
been
burning
its
history
was
lost
in
legend
the
miners
of
the
place
said
that
fire
from
heaven
had
fallen
on
this
sodom
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
where
the
had
committed
abominations
together
so
that
they
had
not
even
had
the
time
to
come
to
the
surface
and
today
were
still
burning
at
the
bottom
of
this
hell
the
calcined
rocks
of
a
sombre
red
were
covered
by
an
efflorescence
of
alum
as
by
a
leprosy
sulphur
grew
like
a
yellow
flower
at
the
edge
of
the
fissures
at
night
those
who
were
brave
enough
to
venture
to
look
into
these
holes
declared
that
they
saw
flames
there
sinful
souls
shrivelling
in
the
furnace
within
wandering
lights
moved
over
the
soil
and
hot
vapours
the
poisons
from
the
devil
ordure
and
his
dirty
kitchen
were
constantly
smoking
and
like
a
miracle
of
eternal
spring
in
the
midst
of
this
accursed
moor
of
tartaret
appeared
with
its
meadows
for
ever
green
its
beeches
with
leaves
unceasingly
renewed
its
fields
where
three
harvests
ripened
it
was
a
natural
warmed
by
the
fire
in
the
deep
strata
beneath
the
snow
never
lay
on
it
the
enormous
bouquet
of
verdure
beside
the
leafless
forest
trees
blossomed
on
this
december
day
and
the
frost
had
not
even
scorched
the
edge
of
it
soon
the
carriage
was
passing
over
the
plain
négrel
joked
over
the
legend
and
explained
that
a
fire
often
occurred
at
the
bottom
of
a
mine
from
the
fermentation
of
the
coal
dust
if
not
mastered
it
would
burn
on
for
ever
and
he
mentioned
a
belgian
pit
which
had
been
flooded
by
diverting
a
river
and
running
it
into
the
pit
but
he
became
silent
for
the
last
few
minutes
groups
of
miners
had
been
constantly
passing
the
carriage
they
went
by
in
silence
with
sidelong
looks
at
the
luxurious
equipage
which
forced
them
to
stand
aside
their
number
went
on
increasing
the
horses
were
obliged
to
cross
the
little
bridge
over
the
scarpe
at
walking
pace
what
was
going
on
then
to
bring
all
these
people
into
the
roads
the
young
ladies
became
frightened
and
négrel
began
to
smell
out
some
fray
in
the
excited
country
it
was
a
relief
when
they
at
last
arrived
at
marchiennes
the
batteries
of
coke
ovens
and
the
chimneys
of
the
blast
furnaces
beneath
a
sun
which
seemed
to
extinguish
them
were
belching
out
smoke
and
raining
their
everlasting
soot
through
the
air
chapter
ii
at
catherine
had
already
been
at
work
for
an
hour
pushing
trams
as
far
as
the
relays
and
she
was
soaked
in
such
a
bath
of
perspiration
that
she
stopped
a
moment
to
wipe
her
face
at
the
bottom
of
the
cutting
where
he
was
hammering
at
the
seam
with
his
mates
chaval
was
astonished
when
he
no
longer
heard
the
rumble
of
the
wheels
the
lamps
burnt
badly
and
the
coal
dust
made
it
impossible
to
see
what
up
he
shouted
when
she
answered
that
she
was
sure
she
would
melt
and
that
her
heart
was
going
to
stop
he
replied
furiously
do
like
us
stupid
take
off
your
shift
they
were
seven
hundred
and
eight
metres
to
the
north
in
the
first
passage
of
the
désirée
seam
which
was
at
a
distance
of
three
kilometres
from
the
when
they
spoke
of
this
part
of
the
pit
the
miners
of
the
region
grew
pale
and
lowered
their
voices
as
if
they
had
spoken
of
hell
and
most
often
they
were
content
to
shake
their
heads
as
men
who
would
rather
not
speak
of
these
depths
of
fiery
furnace
as
the
galleries
sank
towards
the
north
they
approached
tartaret
penetrating
to
that
interior
fire
which
calcined
the
rocks
above
the
cuttings
at
the
point
at
which
they
had
arrived
had
an
average
temperature
of
degrees
they
were
there
in
the
accursed
city
in
the
midst
of
the
flames
which
the
on
the
plain
could
see
through
the
fissures
spitting
out
sulphur
and
poisonous
vapours
catherine
who
had
already
taken
off
her
jacket
hesitated
then
took
off
her
trousers
also
and
with
naked
arms
and
naked
thighs
her
chemise
tied
round
her
hips
by
a
cord
like
a
blouse
she
began
to
push
again
anyhow
that
better
she
said
aloud
in
the
stifling
heat
she
still
felt
a
vague
fear
ever
since
they
began
working
here
five
days
ago
she
had
thought
of
the
stories
told
her
in
childhood
of
those
of
the
days
of
old
who
were
burning
beneath
tartaret
as
a
punishment
for
things
which
no
one
dared
to
repeat
no
doubt
she
was
too
big
now
to
believe
such
silly
stories
but
still
what
would
she
do
if
she
were
suddenly
to
see
coming
out
of
the
wall
a
girl
as
red
as
a
stove
with
eyes
like
live
coals
the
idea
made
her
perspire
still
more
at
the
relay
eighty
metres
from
the
cutting
another
putter
took
the
tram
and
pushed
it
eighty
metres
farther
to
the
upbrow
so
that
the
receiver
could
forward
it
with
the
others
which
came
down
from
the
upper
galleries
gracious
you
making
yourself
comfortable
said
this
woman
a
lean
widow
of
thirty
when
she
saw
catherine
in
her
chemise
i
ca
do
it
the
trammers
at
the
brow
bother
me
with
their
dirty
tricks
ah
well
replied
the
young
girl
i
do
care
about
the
men
i
feel
too
bad
she
went
off
again
pushing
an
empty
tram
the
worst
was
that
in
this
bottom
passage
another
cause
joined
with
the
neighbourhood
of
tartaret
to
make
the
heat
unbearable
they
were
by
the
side
of
old
workings
a
very
deep
abandoned
gallery
of
where
ten
years
earlier
an
explosion
of
had
set
the
seam
alight
and
it
was
still
burning
behind
the
clay
wall
which
had
been
built
there
and
was
kept
constantly
repaired
in
order
to
limit
the
disaster
deprived
of
air
the
fire
ought
to
have
become
extinct
but
no
doubt
unknown
currents
kept
it
alive
it
had
gone
on
for
ten
years
and
heated
the
clay
wall
like
the
bricks
of
an
oven
so
that
those
who
passed
felt
it
was
along
this
wall
for
a
length
of
more
than
a
hundred
metres
that
the
haulage
was
carried
on
in
a
temperature
of
sixty
degrees
after
two
journeys
catherine
again
felt
stifled
fortunately
the
passage
was
large
and
convenient
in
this
désirée
seam
one
of
the
thickest
in
the
district
the
bed
was
one
metre
ninety
in
height
and
the
men
could
work
standing
but
they
would
rather
have
worked
with
twisted
necks
and
a
little
fresh
air
hallo
there
are
you
asleep
said
chaval
again
roughly
as
soon
as
he
no
longer
heard
catherine
moving
how
the
devil
did
i
come
to
get
such
a
jade
will
you
just
fill
your
tram
and
push
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
cutting
leaning
on
her
shovel
she
was
feeling
ill
and
she
looked
at
them
all
with
a
foolish
air
without
obeying
she
scarcely
saw
them
by
the
reddish
gleam
of
the
lamps
entirely
naked
like
animals
so
black
so
encrusted
in
sweat
and
coal
that
their
nakedness
did
not
frighten
her
it
was
a
confused
task
the
bending
of
backs
an
infernal
vision
of
scorched
limbs
spending
their
strength
amid
dull
blows
and
groans
but
they
could
see
her
better
no
doubt
for
the
picks
left
off
hammering
and
they
joked
her
about
taking
off
her
trousers
eh
you
catch
cold
look
out
it
because
she
got
such
fine
legs
i
say
chaval
there
enough
there
for
two
oh
we
must
see
lift
up
higher
higher
then
chaval
without
growing
angry
at
these
jokes
turned
on
her
that
it
by
god
ah
she
likes
dirty
jokes
she
stay
there
to
listen
till
catherine
had
painfully
decided
to
fill
her
tram
then
she
pushed
it
the
gallery
was
too
wide
for
her
to
get
a
purchase
on
the
timber
on
both
sides
her
naked
feet
were
twisted
in
the
rails
where
they
sought
a
point
of
support
while
she
slowly
moved
on
her
arms
stiffened
in
front
and
her
back
breaking
as
soon
as
she
came
up
to
the
clay
wall
the
fiery
torture
again
began
and
the
sweat
fell
from
her
whole
body
in
enormous
drops
as
from
a
she
had
scarcely
got
a
third
of
the
way
before
she
streamed
blinded
soiled
also
by
the
black
mud
her
narrow
chemise
as
though
dipped
in
ink
was
sticking
to
her
skin
and
rising
up
to
her
waist
with
the
movement
of
her
thighs
it
hurt
her
so
that
she
had
once
more
to
stop
her
task
what
was
the
matter
with
her
then
today
never
before
had
she
felt
as
if
there
were
wool
in
her
bones
it
must
be
the
bad
air
the
ventilation
did
not
reach
to
the
bottom
of
this
distant
passage
one
breathed
there
all
sorts
of
vapours
which
came
out
of
the
coal
with
the
low
bubbling
sound
of
a
spring
so
abundantly
sometimes
that
the
lamps
would
not
burn
to
say
nothing
of
which
nobody
noticed
for
from
one
week
end
to
the
other
the
men
were
always
breathing
it
into
their
noses
throughout
the
seam
she
knew
that
bad
air
well
dead
air
the
miners
called
it
the
heavy
asphyxiating
gases
below
above
them
the
light
gases
which
catch
fire
and
blow
up
all
the
stalls
of
a
pit
with
hundreds
of
men
in
a
single
burst
of
thunder
from
her
childhood
she
had
swallowed
so
much
that
she
was
surprised
she
bore
it
so
badly
with
buzzing
ears
and
burning
throat
unable
to
go
farther
she
felt
the
need
of
taking
off
her
chemise
it
was
beginning
to
torture
her
this
garment
of
which
the
least
folds
cut
and
burnt
her
she
resisted
the
longing
and
tried
to
push
again
but
was
forced
to
stand
upright
then
quickly
saying
to
herself
that
she
would
cover
herself
at
the
relay
she
took
off
everything
the
cord
and
the
chemise
so
feverishly
that
she
would
have
torn
off
her
skin
if
she
could
and
now
naked
and
pitiful
brought
down
to
the
level
of
the
female
animal
seeking
its
living
in
the
mire
of
the
streets
covered
with
soot
and
mud
up
to
the
belly
she
laboured
on
like
a
on
all
fours
she
pushed
onwards
but
despair
came
it
gave
her
no
relief
to
be
naked
what
more
could
she
take
off
the
buzzing
in
her
ears
deafened
her
she
seemed
to
feel
a
vice
gripping
her
temples
she
fell
on
her
knees
the
lamp
wedged
into
the
coal
in
the
tram
seemed
to
her
to
be
going
out
the
intention
to
turn
up
the
wick
alone
survived
in
the
midst
of
her
confused
ideas
twice
she
tried
to
examine
it
and
both
times
when
she
placed
it
before
her
on
the
earth
she
saw
it
turn
pale
as
though
it
also
lacked
breath
suddenly
the
lamp
went
out
then
everything
whirled
around
her
in
the
darkness
a
millstone
turned
in
her
head
her
heart
grew
weak
and
left
off
beating
numbed
in
its
turn
by
the
immense
weariness
which
was
putting
her
limbs
to
sleep
she
had
fallen
back
in
anguish
amid
the
asphyxiating
air
close
to
the
ground
by
god
i
believe
she
lazing
again
growled
chaval
voice
he
listened
from
the
top
of
the
cutting
and
could
hear
no
sound
of
wheels
eh
catherine
you
damned
worm
his
voice
was
lost
afar
in
the
black
gallery
and
not
a
breath
replied
i
come
and
make
you
move
i
will
nothing
stirred
there
was
only
the
same
silence
as
of
death
he
came
down
furiously
rushing
along
with
his
lamp
so
violently
that
he
nearly
fell
over
the
putter
body
which
barred
the
way
he
looked
at
her
in
stupefaction
what
was
the
matter
then
was
it
humbug
a
pretence
of
going
to
sleep
but
the
lamp
which
he
had
lowered
to
light
up
her
face
threatened
to
go
out
he
lifted
it
and
lowered
it
afresh
and
at
last
understood
it
must
be
a
gust
of
bad
air
his
violence
disappeared
the
devotion
of
the
miner
in
face
of
a
comrade
peril
was
awaking
within
him
he
shouted
for
her
chemise
to
be
brought
and
seized
the
naked
and
unconscious
girl
in
his
arms
holding
her
as
high
as
possible
when
their
garments
had
been
thrown
over
her
shoulders
he
set
out
running
supporting
his
burden
with
one
hand
and
carrying
the
two
lamps
with
the
other
the
deep
galleries
unrolled
before
him
as
he
rushed
along
turning
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
seeking
life
in
the
frozen
air
of
the
plain
which
blew
down
the
at
last
the
sound
of
a
spring
stopped
him
the
trickle
of
water
flowing
from
the
rock
he
was
at
a
square
in
the
great
haulage
gallery
which
formerly
led
to
the
air
here
blew
in
like
a
tempest
and
was
so
fresh
that
a
shudder
went
through
him
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
earth
against
the
props
his
mistress
was
still
unconscious
with
closed
eyes
catherine
come
now
by
god
no
humbug
hold
yourself
up
a
bit
while
i
dip
this
in
the
water
he
was
frightened
to
find
her
so
limp
however
he
was
able
to
dip
her
chemise
in
the
spring
and
to
bathe
her
face
with
it
she
was
like
a
corpse
already
buried
in
the
depth
of
the
earth
with
her
slender
girlish
body
which
seemed
to
be
still
hesitating
before
swelling
to
the
form
of
puberty
then
a
shudder
ran
over
her
childish
breast
over
the
belly
and
thighs
of
the
poor
little
creature
deflowered
before
her
time
she
opened
her
eyes
and
stammered
i
cold
ah
that
better
now
cried
chaval
relieved
he
dressed
her
slipped
on
the
chemise
easily
but
swore
over
the
difficulty
he
had
in
getting
on
the
trousers
for
she
could
not
help
much
she
remained
dazed
not
understanding
where
she
was
nor
why
she
was
naked
when
she
remembered
she
was
ashamed
how
had
she
dared
to
take
everything
off
and
she
questioned
him
had
she
been
seen
so
without
even
a
handkerchief
around
her
waist
to
cover
her
he
joked
and
made
up
stories
saying
that
he
had
just
brought
her
there
in
the
midst
of
all
the
mates
standing
in
a
row
what
an
idea
to
have
taken
his
advice
and
exhibited
her
bum
afterwards
he
declared
that
the
mates
could
not
even
know
whether
it
was
round
or
square
he
had
rushed
along
so
swiftly
the
deuce
but
i
dying
of
cold
he
said
dressing
himself
in
turn
never
had
she
seen
him
so
kind
usually
for
one
good
word
that
he
said
to
her
she
received
at
once
two
bullying
ones
it
would
have
been
so
pleasant
to
live
in
agreement
a
feeling
of
tenderness
went
through
her
in
the
languor
of
her
fatigue
she
smiled
at
him
and
murmured
kiss
me
he
embraced
her
and
lay
down
beside
her
waiting
till
she
was
able
to
walk
you
know
she
said
again
you
were
wrong
to
shout
at
me
over
there
for
i
could
do
more
really
even
in
the
cutting
you
not
so
hot
if
you
only
knew
how
it
roasts
you
at
the
bottom
of
the
passage
sure
enough
he
replied
it
would
be
better
under
the
trees
you
feel
bad
in
that
stall
i
afraid
my
poor
girl
she
was
so
touched
at
hearing
him
agree
with
her
that
she
tried
to
be
brave
oh
it
a
bad
place
then
the
air
is
poisoned
but
you
shall
see
soon
if
i
a
worm
when
one
has
to
work
one
works
is
it
true
i
die
rather
than
stop
there
was
silence
he
held
her
with
one
arm
round
her
waist
pressing
her
against
his
breast
to
keep
her
from
harm
although
she
already
felt
strong
enough
to
go
back
to
the
stall
she
forgot
everything
in
her
delight
only
she
went
on
in
a
very
low
voice
i
should
like
it
so
much
if
you
were
kinder
yes
it
is
so
good
when
we
love
each
other
a
little
and
she
began
to
cry
softly
but
i
do
love
you
he
cried
for
i
taken
you
with
me
she
only
replied
by
shaking
her
head
there
are
often
men
who
take
women
just
in
order
to
have
them
caring
mighty
little
about
their
happiness
her
tears
flowed
more
hotly
it
made
her
despair
now
to
think
of
the
happy
life
she
would
have
led
if
she
had
chanced
to
fall
to
another
lad
whose
arm
she
would
always
have
felt
thus
round
her
waist
another
and
the
vague
image
of
that
other
arose
from
the
depth
of
her
emotion
but
it
was
done
with
she
only
desired
now
to
live
to
the
end
with
this
one
if
he
would
not
hustle
her
about
too
much
then
she
said
try
to
be
like
this
sometimes
sobs
cut
short
her
words
and
he
embraced
her
again
you
a
stupid
there
i
swear
to
be
kind
i
not
worse
than
any
one
else
go
on
she
looked
at
him
and
began
to
smile
through
her
tears
perhaps
he
was
right
one
never
met
women
who
were
happy
then
although
she
distrusted
his
oath
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
joy
of
seeing
him
affectionate
good
god
if
only
that
could
last
they
had
both
embraced
again
and
as
they
were
pressing
each
other
in
a
long
clasp
they
heard
steps
which
made
them
get
up
three
mates
who
had
seen
them
pass
had
come
up
to
know
how
she
was
they
set
out
together
it
was
nearly
ten
and
they
took
their
lunch
into
a
cool
corner
before
going
back
to
sweat
at
the
bottom
of
the
cutting
they
were
finishing
the
double
slice
of
their
brick
and
were
about
to
drink
the
coffee
from
their
tin
when
they
were
disturbed
by
a
noise
coming
from
stalls
in
the
distance
what
then
was
it
another
accident
they
got
up
and
ran
pikemen
putters
trammers
crossed
them
at
every
step
no
one
knew
anything
all
were
shouting
it
must
be
some
great
misfortune
gradually
the
whole
mine
was
in
terror
frightened
shadows
emerged
from
the
galleries
lanterns
danced
and
flew
away
in
the
darkness
where
was
it
why
could
no
one
say
all
at
once
a
captain
passed
shouting
they
are
cutting
the
cables
they
are
cutting
the
cables
then
the
panic
increased
it
was
a
furious
gallop
through
the
gloomy
passages
their
heads
were
confused
why
cut
the
cables
and
who
was
cutting
them
when
the
men
were
below
it
seemed
monstrous
but
the
voice
of
another
captain
was
heard
and
then
lost
the
montsou
men
are
cutting
the
cables
let
every
one
go
up
when
he
had
understood
chaval
stopped
catherine
short
the
idea
that
he
would
meet
the
montsou
men
up
above
should
he
get
out
paralysed
his
legs
it
had
come
then
that
band
which
he
thought
had
got
into
the
hands
of
the
police
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
retracing
his
path
and
ascending
through
but
that
was
no
longer
possible
he
swore
hesitating
hiding
his
fear
repeating
that
it
was
stupid
to
run
like
that
they
would
not
surely
leave
them
at
the
bottom
the
captain
voice
echoed
anew
now
approaching
them
let
every
one
go
up
to
the
ladders
to
the
ladders
and
chaval
was
carried
away
with
his
mates
he
pushed
catherine
and
accused
her
of
not
running
fast
enough
did
she
want
then
to
remain
in
the
pit
to
die
of
hunger
for
those
montsou
brigands
were
capable
of
breaking
the
ladders
without
waiting
for
people
to
come
up
this
abominable
suggestion
ended
by
driving
them
wild
along
the
galleries
there
was
only
a
furious
rush
a
race
of
madmen
each
striving
to
arrive
first
and
mount
before
the
others
some
men
shouted
that
the
ladders
were
broken
and
that
no
one
could
get
out
and
then
in
frightened
groups
they
began
to
reach
the
where
they
were
all
engulfed
they
threw
themselves
toward
the
shaft
they
crushed
through
the
narrow
door
to
the
ladder
passage
while
an
old
groom
who
had
prudently
led
back
the
horses
to
the
stable
looked
at
them
with
an
air
of
contemptuous
indifference
accustomed
to
spend
nights
in
the
pit
and
certain
that
he
could
eventually
be
drawn
out
of
it
by
god
will
you
climb
up
in
front
of
me
said
chaval
to
catherine
at
least
i
can
hold
you
if
you
fall
out
of
breath
and
suffocated
by
this
race
of
three
kilometres
which
had
once
more
bathed
her
in
sweat
she
gave
herself
up
without
understanding
to
the
eddies
of
the
crowd
then
he
pulled
her
by
the
arm
almost
breaking
it
and
she
cried
with
pain
her
tears
bursting
out
already
he
was
forgetting
his
oath
never
would
she
be
happy
go
on
then
he
roared
but
he
frightened
her
too
much
if
she
went
first
he
would
bully
her
the
whole
time
so
she
resisted
while
the
wild
flood
of
their
comrades
pushed
them
to
one
side
the
water
that
filtered
from
the
shaft
was
falling
in
great
drops
and
the
floor
of
the
shaken
by
this
tramping
was
trembling
over
the
sump
the
muddy
cesspool
ten
metres
deep
at
two
years
earlier
a
terrible
accident
had
happened
just
here
the
breaking
of
a
cable
had
precipitated
the
cage
to
the
bottom
of
the
sump
in
which
two
men
had
been
drowned
and
they
all
thought
of
this
every
one
would
be
left
down
there
if
they
all
crowded
on
to
the
planks
confounded
dunderhead
shouted
chaval
die
then
i
shall
be
rid
of
you
he
climbed
up
and
she
followed
from
the
bottom
to
daylight
there
were
a
hundred
and
two
ladders
about
seven
metres
in
length
each
placed
on
a
narrow
landing
which
occupied
the
breadth
of
the
passage
and
in
which
a
square
hole
scarcely
allowed
the
shoulders
to
pass
it
was
like
a
flat
chimney
seven
hundred
metres
in
height
between
the
wall
of
the
shaft
and
the
brattice
of
the
a
damp
pipe
black
and
endless
in
which
the
ladders
were
placed
one
above
the
other
almost
straight
in
regular
stages
it
took
a
strong
man
minutes
to
climb
up
this
giant
column
the
passage
however
was
no
longer
used
except
in
cases
of
accident
catherine
at
first
climbed
bravely
her
naked
feet
were
used
to
the
hard
coal
on
the
floors
of
the
passages
and
did
not
suffer
from
the
square
rungs
covered
with
iron
rods
to
prevent
them
from
wearing
away
her
hands
hardened
by
the
haulage
grasped
without
fatigue
the
uprights
that
were
too
big
for
her
and
it
even
interested
her
and
took
her
out
of
her
grief
this
unforeseen
ascent
this
long
serpent
of
men
flowing
on
and
hoisting
themselves
up
three
on
a
ladder
so
that
even
when
the
head
should
emerge
in
daylight
the
tail
would
still
be
trailing
over
the
sump
they
were
not
there
yet
the
first
could
hardly
have
ascended
a
third
of
the
shaft
no
one
spoke
now
only
their
feet
moved
with
a
low
sound
while
the
lamps
like
travelling
stars
spaced
out
from
below
upward
formed
a
continually
increasing
line
catherine
heard
a
trammer
behind
her
counting
the
ladders
it
gave
her
the
idea
of
counting
them
also
they
had
already
mounted
fifteen
and
were
arriving
at
a
but
at
that
moment
she
collided
with
chaval
legs
he
swore
shouting
to
her
to
look
out
gradually
the
whole
column
stopped
and
became
motionless
what
then
had
something
happened
and
every
one
recovered
his
voice
to
ask
questions
and
to
express
fear
their
anxiety
had
increased
since
leaving
the
bottom
their
ignorance
as
to
what
was
going
on
above
oppressed
them
more
as
they
approached
daylight
someone
announced
that
they
would
have
to
go
down
again
that
the
ladders
were
broken
that
was
the
thought
that
preoccupied
them
all
the
fear
of
finding
themselves
face
to
face
with
space
another
explanation
came
down
from
mouth
to
mouth
there
had
been
an
accident
a
pikeman
slipped
from
a
rung
no
one
knew
exactly
the
shouts
made
it
impossible
to
hear
were
they
going
to
bed
there
at
last
without
any
precise
information
being
obtained
the
ascent
began
again
with
the
same
slow
painful
movement
in
the
midst
of
the
tread
of
feet
and
the
dancing
of
lamps
it
must
certainly
be
higher
up
that
the
ladders
were
broken
at
the
ladder
as
they
passed
a
third
catherine
felt
her
legs
and
arms
grow
stiff
at
first
she
had
felt
a
slight
tingling
in
her
skin
now
she
lost
the
sensation
of
the
iron
and
the
wood
beneath
her
feet
and
in
her
hands
a
vague
pain
which
gradually
became
burning
heated
her
muscles
and
in
the
dizziness
which
came
over
her
she
recalled
her
grandfather
bonnemort
stories
of
the
days
when
there
was
no
passage
and
little
girls
of
ten
used
to
take
out
the
coal
on
their
shoulders
up
bare
ladders
so
that
if
one
of
them
slipped
or
a
fragment
of
coal
simply
rolled
out
of
a
basket
three
or
four
children
would
fall
down
head
first
from
the
blow
the
cramp
in
her
limbs
became
unbearable
she
would
never
reach
the
end
fresh
stoppages
allowed
her
to
breathe
but
the
terror
which
was
communicated
every
time
from
above
dazed
her
still
more
above
and
below
her
respiration
became
more
difficult
this
interminable
ascent
was
causing
giddiness
and
the
nausea
affected
her
with
the
others
she
was
suffocating
intoxicated
with
the
darkness
exasperated
with
the
walls
which
crushed
against
her
flesh
and
shuddering
also
with
the
dampness
her
body
perspiring
beneath
the
great
drops
which
fell
on
her
they
were
approaching
a
level
where
so
thick
a
rain
fell
that
it
threatened
to
extinguish
their
lamps
chaval
twice
spoke
to
catherine
without
obtaining
any
reply
what
the
devil
was
she
doing
down
there
had
she
let
her
tongue
fall
she
might
just
tell
him
if
she
was
all
right
they
had
been
climbing
for
half
an
hour
but
so
heavily
that
he
had
only
reached
the
ladder
there
were
still
catherine
at
last
stammered
that
she
was
getting
on
all
right
he
would
have
treated
her
as
a
worm
if
she
had
acknowledged
her
weariness
the
iron
of
the
rungs
must
have
cut
her
feet
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
sawing
in
up
to
the
bone
after
every
grip
she
expected
to
see
her
hands
leave
the
uprights
they
were
so
peeled
and
stiff
she
could
not
close
her
fingers
and
she
feared
she
would
fall
backward
with
torn
shoulders
and
dislocated
thighs
in
this
continual
effort
it
was
especially
the
defective
slope
of
the
ladders
from
which
she
suffered
the
almost
perpendicular
position
which
obliged
her
to
hoist
herself
up
by
the
strength
of
her
wrists
with
her
belly
against
the
wood
the
panting
of
many
breaths
now
drowned
the
sound
of
the
feet
forming
an
enormous
moan
multiplied
tenfold
by
the
partition
of
the
passage
arising
from
the
depths
and
expiring
towards
the
light
there
was
a
groan
word
ran
along
that
a
trammer
had
just
cut
his
head
open
against
the
edge
of
a
stair
and
catherine
went
on
climbing
they
had
passed
the
level
the
rain
had
ceased
a
mist
made
heavy
the
air
poisoned
with
the
odour
of
old
iron
and
damp
wood
mechanically
she
continued
to
count
in
a
low
voice
still
nineteen
the
repetition
of
these
figures
supported
her
merely
by
their
rhythmic
balance
she
had
no
further
consciousness
of
her
movements
when
she
lifted
her
eyes
the
lamps
turned
in
a
spiral
her
blood
was
flowing
she
felt
that
she
was
dying
the
least
breath
would
have
knocked
her
over
the
worst
was
that
those
below
were
now
pushing
and
that
the
entire
column
was
stampeding
yielding
to
the
growing
anger
of
its
fatigue
the
furious
need
to
see
the
sun
again
the
first
mates
had
emerged
there
were
then
no
broken
ladders
but
the
idea
that
they
might
yet
be
broken
to
prevent
the
last
from
coming
up
when
others
were
already
breathing
up
above
nearly
drove
them
mad
and
when
a
new
stoppage
occurred
oaths
broke
out
and
all
went
on
climbing
hustling
each
other
passing
over
each
other
bodies
to
arrive
at
all
costs
then
catherine
fell
she
had
cried
chaval
name
in
despairing
appeal
he
did
not
hear
he
was
struggling
digging
his
heels
into
a
ribs
to
get
before
him
and
she
was
rolled
down
and
trampled
over
as
she
fainted
she
dreamed
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
one
of
the
little
of
old
days
and
that
a
fragment
of
coal
fallen
from
the
basket
above
her
had
thrown
her
to
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
like
a
sparrow
struck
by
a
flint
five
ladders
only
remained
to
climb
it
had
taken
nearly
an
hour
she
never
knew
how
she
reached
daylight
carried
up
on
people
shoulders
supported
by
the
throttling
narrowness
of
the
passage
suddenly
she
found
herself
in
the
dazzling
sunlight
in
the
midst
of
a
yelling
crowd
who
were
hooting
her
chapter
iii
from
early
morning
before
daylight
a
tremor
had
agitated
the
settlements
and
that
tremor
was
now
swelling
through
the
roads
and
over
the
whole
country
but
the
departure
had
not
taken
place
as
arranged
for
the
news
had
spread
that
cavalry
and
police
were
scouring
the
plain
it
was
said
that
they
had
arrived
from
douai
during
the
night
and
rasseneur
was
accused
of
having
betrayed
his
mates
by
warning
hennebeau
a
putter
even
swore
that
she
had
seen
the
servant
taking
a
dispatch
to
the
telegraph
office
the
miners
clenched
their
fists
and
watched
the
soldiers
from
behind
their
shutters
by
the
pale
light
of
the
early
morning
towards
seven
as
the
sun
was
rising
another
rumour
circulated
reassuring
the
impatient
it
was
a
false
alarm
a
simple
military
promenade
such
as
the
general
occasionally
ordered
since
the
strike
had
broken
out
at
the
desire
of
the
prefect
of
lille
the
strikers
detested
this
official
they
reproached
him
with
deceiving
them
by
the
promise
of
a
conciliatory
intervention
which
was
limited
to
a
march
of
troops
into
montsou
every
week
to
overawe
them
so
when
the
cavalry
and
police
quietly
took
the
road
back
to
marchiennes
after
contenting
themselves
with
deafening
the
settlements
by
the
stamping
of
their
horses
over
the
hard
earth
the
miners
jeered
at
this
innocent
prefect
and
his
soldiers
who
turned
on
their
heels
when
things
were
beginning
to
get
hot
up
till
nine
they
stood
peacefully
about
in
good
humour
before
their
houses
following
with
their
eyes
up
the
streets
the
meek
backs
of
the
last
gendarmes
in
the
depths
of
their
large
beds
the
good
people
of
montsou
were
still
sleeping
with
their
heads
among
the
feathers
at
the
manager
house
madame
hennebeau
had
just
been
seen
setting
out
in
the
carriage
leaving
hennebeau
at
work
no
doubt
for
the
closed
and
silent
villa
seemed
dead
not
one
of
the
pits
had
any
military
guard
it
was
a
fatal
lack
of
foresight
in
the
hour
of
danger
the
natural
stupidity
which
accompanies
catastrophes
the
fault
which
a
government
commits
whenever
there
is
need
of
precise
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
nine
was
striking
when
the
colliers
at
last
took
the
vandame
road
to
repair
to
the
rendezvous
decided
on
the
day
before
in
the
forest
étienne
had
very
quickly
perceived
that
he
would
certainly
not
find
over
at
the
three
thousand
comrades
on
whom
he
was
counting
many
believed
that
the
demonstration
was
put
off
and
the
worst
was
that
two
or
three
bands
already
on
the
way
would
compromise
the
cause
if
he
did
not
at
all
costs
put
himself
at
their
head
almost
a
hundred
who
had
set
out
before
daylight
were
taking
refuge
beneath
the
forest
beeches
waiting
for
the
others
souvarine
whom
the
young
man
went
up
to
consult
shrugged
his
shoulders
ten
resolute
fellows
could
do
more
work
than
a
crowd
and
he
turned
back
to
the
open
book
before
him
refusing
to
join
in
the
thing
threatened
to
turn
into
sentiment
when
it
would
have
been
enough
to
adopt
the
simple
method
of
burning
montsou
as
étienne
left
the
house
he
saw
rasseneur
seated
before
the
metal
stove
and
looking
very
pale
while
his
wife
in
her
everlasting
black
dress
was
abusing
him
in
polite
and
cutting
terms
maheu
was
of
opinion
that
they
ought
to
keep
their
promise
a
rendezvous
like
this
was
sacred
however
the
night
had
calmed
their
fever
he
was
now
fearing
misfortune
and
he
explained
that
it
was
their
duty
to
go
over
there
to
maintain
their
mates
in
the
right
path
maheude
approved
with
a
nod
étienne
repeated
complacently
that
it
was
necessary
to
adopt
revolutionary
methods
without
attempting
any
person
life
before
setting
out
he
refused
his
share
of
a
loaf
that
had
been
given
him
the
evening
before
together
with
a
bottle
of
gin
but
he
drank
three
little
glasses
one
after
the
other
saying
that
he
wanted
to
keep
out
the
cold
he
even
carried
away
a
tinful
alzire
would
look
after
the
children
old
bonnemort
whose
legs
were
suffering
from
yesterday
walk
remained
in
bed
they
did
not
go
away
together
from
motives
of
prudence
jeanlin
had
disappeared
long
ago
maheu
and
maheude
went
off
on
the
side
sloping
towards
montsou
while
étienne
turned
towards
the
forest
where
he
proposed
to
join
his
mates
on
the
way
he
caught
up
a
band
of
women
among
whom
he
recognized
mother
brulé
and
the
levaque
woman
as
they
walked
they
were
eating
chestnuts
which
mouquette
had
brought
they
swallowed
the
skins
so
as
to
feel
more
in
their
stomachs
but
in
the
forest
he
found
no
one
the
men
were
already
at
he
took
the
same
course
and
arrived
at
the
pit
at
the
moment
when
levaque
and
some
hundreds
others
were
penetrating
into
the
square
miners
were
coming
up
from
every
direction
the
men
by
the
main
road
the
women
by
the
fields
all
at
random
without
leaders
without
weapons
flowing
naturally
thither
like
water
which
runs
down
a
slope
étienne
perceived
jeanlin
who
had
climbed
up
on
a
installed
as
though
at
a
theatre
he
ran
faster
and
entered
among
the
first
there
were
scarcely
three
hundred
of
them
there
was
some
hesitation
when
deneulin
showed
himself
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
which
led
to
the
what
do
you
want
he
asked
in
a
loud
voice
after
having
watched
the
disappearance
of
the
carriage
from
which
his
daughters
were
still
laughing
towards
him
he
had
returned
to
the
pit
overtaken
by
a
strange
anxiety
everything
however
was
found
in
good
order
the
men
had
gone
down
the
cage
was
working
and
he
became
reassured
again
and
was
talking
to
the
head
captain
when
the
approach
of
the
strikers
was
announced
to
him
he
had
placed
himself
at
a
window
of
the
and
in
the
face
of
this
increasing
flood
which
filled
the
square
he
at
once
felt
his
impotence
how
could
he
defend
these
buildings
open
on
every
side
he
could
scarcely
group
some
twenty
of
his
workmen
round
himself
he
was
lost
what
do
you
want
he
repeated
pale
with
repressed
anger
making
an
effort
to
accept
his
disaster
courageously
there
were
pushes
and
growls
amid
the
crowd
étienne
at
last
came
forward
saying
we
do
not
come
to
injure
you
sir
but
work
must
cease
everywhere
deneulin
frankly
treated
him
as
an
idiot
do
you
think
you
will
benefit
me
if
you
stop
work
at
my
place
you
might
just
as
well
fire
a
gun
off
into
my
back
yes
my
men
are
below
and
they
shall
not
come
up
unless
you
mean
to
murder
me
first
these
rough
words
raised
a
clamour
maheu
had
to
hold
back
levaque
who
was
pushing
forward
in
a
threatening
manner
while
étienne
went
on
discussing
and
tried
to
convince
deneulin
of
the
lawfulness
of
their
revolutionary
conduct
but
the
latter
replied
by
the
right
to
work
besides
he
refused
to
discuss
such
folly
he
meant
to
be
master
in
his
own
place
his
only
regret
was
that
he
had
not
four
gendarmes
here
to
sweep
away
this
mob
to
be
sure
it
is
my
fault
i
deserve
what
has
happened
to
me
with
fellows
of
your
sort
force
is
the
only
argument
the
government
thinks
to
buy
you
by
concessions
you
will
throw
it
down
that
all
when
it
has
given
you
weapons
étienne
was
quivering
but
still
held
himself
in
he
lowered
his
voice
i
beg
you
sir
give
the
order
for
your
men
to
come
up
i
can
not
answer
for
my
mates
you
may
avoid
a
disaster
no
be
good
enough
to
let
me
alone
do
i
know
you
you
do
not
belong
to
my
works
you
have
no
quarrel
with
me
it
is
only
brigands
who
thus
scour
the
country
to
pillage
houses
loud
vociferations
now
drowned
his
voice
the
women
especially
abused
him
but
he
continued
to
hold
his
own
experiencing
a
certain
relief
in
this
frankness
with
which
he
expressed
his
disciplinarian
nature
since
he
was
ruined
in
any
case
he
thought
platitudes
a
useless
cowardice
but
their
numbers
went
on
increasing
nearly
five
hundred
were
pushing
towards
the
door
and
he
might
have
been
torn
to
pieces
if
his
head
captain
had
not
pulled
him
violently
back
for
mercy
sake
sir
there
will
be
a
massacre
what
is
the
good
of
letting
men
be
killed
for
nothing
he
struggled
and
protested
in
one
last
cry
thrown
at
the
crowd
you
set
of
brigands
you
will
know
what
when
we
are
strongest
again
they
led
him
away
the
hustling
of
the
crowd
had
thrown
the
first
ranks
against
the
staircase
so
that
the
rail
was
twisted
it
was
the
women
who
pushed
and
screamed
and
urged
on
the
men
the
door
yielded
at
once
it
was
a
door
without
a
lock
simply
closed
by
a
latch
but
the
staircase
was
too
narrow
for
the
pushing
crowd
which
would
have
taken
long
to
get
in
if
the
rear
of
the
besiegers
had
not
gone
off
to
enter
by
other
openings
then
they
poured
in
on
all
sides
by
the
shed
the
the
boiler
buildings
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
whole
pit
belonged
to
them
they
swarmed
at
every
story
in
the
midst
of
furious
gestures
and
cries
carried
away
by
their
victory
over
this
master
who
resisted
maheu
in
terror
had
rushed
forward
among
the
first
saying
to
étienne
they
must
not
kill
him
the
latter
was
already
running
then
when
étienne
understood
that
deneulin
had
barricaded
himself
in
the
captains
room
he
replied
well
would
it
be
our
fault
such
a
madman
he
was
feeling
anxious
however
being
still
too
calm
to
yield
to
this
outburst
of
anger
his
pride
of
leadership
also
suffered
on
seeing
the
band
escape
from
his
authority
and
become
enraged
going
beyond
the
cold
execution
of
the
will
of
the
people
such
as
he
had
anticipated
in
vain
he
called
for
coolness
shouting
that
they
must
not
put
right
on
their
enemies
side
by
acts
of
useless
destruction
to
the
boilers
shouted
mother
brulé
put
out
the
fires
levaque
who
had
found
a
file
was
brandishing
it
like
a
dagger
dominating
the
tumult
with
a
terrible
cry
cut
the
cables
cut
the
cables
soon
they
all
repeated
this
only
étienne
and
maheu
continued
to
protest
dazed
and
talking
in
the
tumult
without
obtaining
silence
at
last
the
former
was
able
to
say
but
there
are
men
below
mates
the
noise
redoubled
and
voices
arose
from
all
sides
so
much
the
worse
ought
not
to
go
down
serve
the
traitors
right
yes
yes
let
them
stay
there
and
then
they
have
the
ladders
then
when
this
idea
of
the
ladders
had
made
them
still
more
obstinate
étienne
saw
that
he
would
have
to
yield
for
fear
of
a
greater
disaster
he
hastened
towards
the
engine
wishing
at
all
events
to
bring
the
cages
up
so
that
the
cables
being
cut
above
the
shaft
should
not
smash
them
by
falling
down
with
their
enormous
weight
the
had
disappeared
as
well
as
the
few
daylight
workers
and
he
took
hold
of
the
starting
lever
manipulating
it
while
levaque
and
two
other
climbed
up
the
metal
scaffold
which
supported
the
pulleys
the
cages
were
hardly
fixed
on
the
keeps
when
the
strident
sound
was
heard
of
the
file
biting
into
the
steel
there
was
deep
silence
and
this
noise
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
pit
all
raised
their
heads
looking
and
listening
seized
by
emotion
in
the
first
rank
maheu
felt
a
fierce
joy
possess
him
as
if
the
teeth
of
the
file
would
deliver
them
from
misfortune
by
eating
into
the
cable
of
one
of
these
dens
of
wretchedness
into
which
they
would
never
descend
again
but
mother
brulé
had
disappeared
by
the
shed
stairs
still
shouting
the
fires
must
be
put
out
to
the
boilers
to
the
boilers
some
women
followed
her
maheude
hastened
to
prevent
them
from
smashing
everything
just
as
her
husband
had
tried
to
reason
with
the
men
she
was
the
calmest
of
them
one
could
demand
one
rights
without
making
a
mess
in
people
places
when
she
entered
the
boiler
building
the
women
were
already
chasing
away
the
two
stokers
and
the
brulé
armed
with
a
large
shovel
and
crouching
down
before
one
of
the
stoves
was
violently
emptying
it
throwing
the
coke
on
to
the
brick
floor
where
it
continued
to
burn
with
black
smoke
there
were
ten
stoves
for
the
five
boilers
soon
the
women
warmed
to
the
work
the
levaque
manipulating
her
shovel
with
both
hands
mouquette
raising
her
clothes
up
to
her
thighs
so
as
not
to
catch
fire
all
looking
red
in
the
reflection
of
the
flames
sweating
and
dishevelled
in
this
kitchen
the
piles
of
coal
increased
and
the
burning
heat
cracked
the
ceiling
of
the
vast
hall
enough
now
cried
maheude
the
is
afire
so
much
the
better
replied
mother
brulé
that
will
do
the
work
ah
by
god
have
i
said
that
i
would
pay
them
out
for
the
death
of
my
man
at
this
moment
jeanlin
shrill
voice
was
heard
look
out
i
put
it
out
i
will
i
let
it
all
off
he
had
come
in
among
the
first
and
had
kicked
his
legs
about
among
the
crowd
delighted
at
the
fray
and
seeking
out
what
mischief
he
could
do
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
to
turn
on
the
discharge
taps
and
let
off
the
steam
the
jets
came
out
with
the
violence
of
volleys
the
five
boilers
were
emptied
with
the
sound
of
a
tempest
whistling
in
such
a
roar
of
thunder
that
one
ears
seemed
to
bleed
everything
had
disappeared
in
the
midst
of
the
vapour
the
hot
coal
grew
pale
and
the
women
were
nothing
more
than
shadows
with
broken
gestures
the
child
alone
appeared
mounted
on
the
gallery
behind
the
whirlwinds
of
white
steam
filled
with
delight
and
grinning
broadly
in
the
joy
of
unchaining
this
hurricane
this
lasted
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
few
buckets
of
water
had
been
thrown
over
the
heaps
to
complete
their
extinction
all
danger
of
a
fire
had
gone
by
but
the
anger
of
the
crowd
had
not
subsided
on
the
contrary
it
had
been
whipped
up
men
went
down
with
hammers
even
the
women
armed
themselves
with
iron
bars
and
they
talked
of
smashing
boilers
of
breaking
engines
and
of
demolishing
the
mine
étienne
forewarned
hastened
to
come
up
with
maheu
he
himself
was
becoming
intoxicated
and
carried
away
by
this
hot
fever
of
revenge
he
struggled
however
and
entreated
them
to
be
calm
now
that
with
cut
cables
extinguished
fires
and
empty
boilers
work
was
impossible
he
was
not
always
listened
to
and
was
again
about
to
be
carried
away
by
the
crowd
when
hoots
arose
outside
at
a
little
low
door
where
the
ladder
passage
emerged
down
with
the
traitors
oh
the
dirty
chops
of
the
cowards
down
with
them
down
with
them
the
men
were
beginning
to
come
up
from
below
the
first
arrivals
blinded
by
the
daylight
stood
there
with
quivering
eyelids
then
they
moved
away
trying
to
gain
the
road
and
flee
down
with
the
cowards
down
with
the
traitors
the
whole
band
of
strikers
had
run
up
in
less
than
three
minutes
there
was
not
a
man
left
in
the
buildings
the
five
hundred
montsou
men
were
ranged
in
two
rows
and
the
vandame
men
who
had
had
the
treachery
to
go
down
were
forced
to
pass
between
this
double
hedge
and
as
every
fresh
miner
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
passage
covered
with
the
black
mud
of
work
and
with
garments
in
rags
the
hooting
redoubled
and
ferocious
jokes
arose
oh
look
at
that
one
three
inches
of
legs
and
then
his
arse
and
this
one
with
his
nose
eaten
by
those
volcan
girls
and
this
other
with
eyes
pissing
out
enough
wax
to
furnish
ten
cathedrals
and
this
other
the
tall
fellow
without
a
rump
and
as
long
as
lent
an
enormous
who
rolled
out
with
her
breast
to
her
belly
and
her
belly
to
her
backside
raised
a
furious
laugh
they
wanted
to
handle
them
the
joking
increased
and
was
turning
to
cruelty
blows
would
soon
have
rained
while
the
row
of
poor
devils
came
out
shivering
and
silent
beneath
the
abuse
with
sidelong
looks
in
expectation
of
blows
glad
when
they
could
at
last
rush
away
out
of
the
mine
hallo
how
many
are
there
in
there
asked
étienne
he
was
astonished
to
see
them
still
coming
out
and
irritated
at
the
idea
that
it
was
not
a
mere
handful
of
workers
urged
by
hunger
terrorized
by
the
captains
they
had
lied
to
him
then
in
the
forest
nearly
all
had
gone
down
but
a
cry
escaped
from
him
and
he
rushed
forward
when
he
saw
chaval
standing
on
the
threshold
by
god
is
this
the
rendezvous
you
called
us
to
imprecations
broke
out
and
there
was
a
movement
of
the
crowd
towards
the
traitor
what
he
had
sworn
with
them
the
day
before
and
now
they
found
him
down
below
with
the
others
was
he
then
making
fools
of
people
off
with
him
to
the
shaft
to
the
shaft
chaval
white
with
fear
stammered
and
tried
to
explain
but
étienne
cut
him
short
carried
out
of
himself
and
sharing
the
fury
of
the
band
you
wanted
to
be
in
it
and
you
shall
be
in
it
come
on
take
your
damned
snout
along
another
clamour
covered
his
voice
catherine
in
her
turn
had
just
appeared
dazzled
by
the
bright
sunlight
and
frightened
at
falling
into
the
midst
of
these
savages
she
was
panting
with
legs
aching
from
the
hundred
and
two
ladders
and
with
bleeding
palms
when
maheude
seeing
her
rushed
forward
with
her
hand
up
ah
slut
you
too
when
your
mother
is
dying
of
hunger
you
betray
her
for
your
bully
maheu
held
back
her
arm
and
stopped
the
blow
but
he
shook
his
daughter
he
was
enraged
like
his
wife
he
threw
her
conduct
in
her
face
and
both
lost
their
heads
shouting
louder
than
their
mates
the
sight
of
catherine
had
completed
étienne
exasperation
he
repeated
on
we
go
to
the
other
pits
and
you
come
with
us
you
dirty
devil
chaval
had
scarcely
time
to
get
his
sabots
from
the
shed
and
to
throw
his
woollen
jacket
over
his
frozen
shoulders
they
all
dragged
him
on
forcing
him
to
run
in
the
midst
of
them
catherine
bewildered
also
put
on
her
sabots
buttoning
at
her
neck
her
man
old
jacket
with
which
she
kept
off
the
cold
and
she
ran
behind
her
lover
she
would
not
leave
him
for
surely
they
were
going
to
murder
him
then
in
two
minutes
was
emptied
jeanlin
had
found
a
horn
and
was
blowing
it
producing
hoarse
sounds
as
though
he
were
gathering
oxen
together
the
women
mother
brulé
the
levaque
and
mouquette
raised
their
skirts
to
run
while
levaque
with
an
axe
in
his
hand
manipulated
it
like
a
stick
other
men
continued
to
arrive
they
were
nearly
a
thousand
without
order
again
flowing
on
to
the
road
like
a
torrent
let
loose
the
gates
were
too
narrow
and
the
palings
were
broken
down
to
the
pits
down
with
the
traitors
no
more
work
and
fell
suddenly
into
a
great
silence
not
a
man
was
left
not
a
breath
was
heard
deneulin
came
out
of
the
captains
room
and
quite
alone
with
a
gesture
forbidding
any
one
to
follow
him
he
went
over
the
pit
he
was
pale
and
very
calm
at
first
he
stopped
before
the
shaft
lifting
his
eyes
to
look
at
the
cut
cables
the
steel
ends
hung
useless
the
bite
of
the
file
had
left
a
living
scar
a
fresh
wound
which
gleamed
in
the
black
grease
afterwards
he
went
up
to
the
engine
and
looked
at
the
crank
which
was
motionless
like
the
joint
of
a
colossal
limb
struck
by
paralysis
he
touched
the
metal
which
had
already
cooled
and
the
cold
made
him
shudder
as
though
he
had
touched
a
corpse
then
he
went
down
to
the
walked
slowly
before
the
extinguished
stoves
yawning
and
inundated
and
struck
his
foot
against
the
boilers
which
sounded
hollow
well
it
was
quite
finished
his
ruin
was
complete
even
if
he
mended
the
cables
and
lit
the
fires
where
would
he
find
men
another
fortnight
strike
and
he
would
be
bankrupt
and
in
this
certainty
of
disaster
he
no
longer
felt
any
hatred
of
the
montsou
brigands
he
felt
that
all
had
a
complicity
in
it
that
it
was
a
general
agelong
fault
they
were
brutes
no
doubt
but
brutes
who
could
not
read
and
who
were
dying
of
hunger
chapter
iv
and
the
troop
went
off
over
the
flat
plain
white
with
frost
beneath
the
pale
winter
sun
and
overflowed
the
path
as
they
passed
through
the
beetroot
fields
from
the
étienne
had
assumed
command
he
cried
his
orders
while
the
crowd
moved
on
and
organized
the
march
jeanlin
galloped
at
the
head
performing
barbarous
music
on
his
horn
then
the
women
came
in
the
first
ranks
some
of
them
armed
with
sticks
maheude
with
wild
eyes
seemed
to
be
seeking
afar
for
the
promised
city
of
justice
mother
brulé
the
levaque
woman
mouquette
striding
along
beneath
their
rags
like
soldiers
setting
out
for
the
seat
of
war
if
they
had
any
encounters
we
should
see
if
the
police
dared
to
strike
women
and
the
men
followed
in
a
confused
flock
a
stream
that
grew
larger
and
larger
bristling
with
iron
bars
and
dominated
by
levaque
single
axe
with
its
blade
glistening
in
the
sun
étienne
in
the
middle
kept
chaval
in
sight
forcing
him
to
walk
before
him
while
maheu
behind
gloomily
kept
an
eye
on
catherine
the
only
woman
among
these
men
obstinately
trotting
near
her
lover
for
fear
that
he
would
be
hurt
bare
heads
were
dishevelled
in
the
air
only
the
clank
of
sabots
could
be
heard
like
the
movement
of
released
cattle
carried
away
by
jeanlin
wild
trumpeting
but
suddenly
a
new
cry
arose
bread
bread
bread
it
was
midday
the
hunger
of
six
weeks
on
strike
was
awaking
in
these
empty
stomachs
whipped
up
by
this
race
across
the
fields
the
few
crusts
of
the
morning
and
mouquette
chestnuts
had
long
been
forgotten
their
stomachs
were
crying
out
and
this
suffering
was
added
to
their
fury
against
the
traitors
to
the
pits
no
more
work
bread
étienne
who
had
refused
to
eat
his
share
at
the
settlement
felt
an
unbearable
tearing
sensation
in
his
chest
he
made
no
complaint
but
mechanically
took
his
tin
from
time
to
time
and
swallowed
a
gulp
of
gin
shaking
so
much
that
he
thought
he
needed
it
to
carry
him
to
the
end
his
cheeks
were
heated
and
his
eyes
inflamed
he
kept
his
head
however
and
still
wished
to
avoid
needless
destruction
as
they
arrived
at
the
joiselle
road
a
vandame
pikeman
who
had
joined
the
band
for
revenge
on
his
master
impelled
the
men
towards
the
right
shouting
to
must
stop
the
pump
let
the
water
ruin
the
mob
was
already
turning
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
étienne
who
begged
them
to
let
the
pumping
continue
what
was
the
good
of
destroying
the
galleries
it
offended
his
workman
heart
in
spite
of
his
resentment
maheu
also
thought
it
unjust
to
take
revenge
on
a
machine
but
the
pikeman
still
shouted
his
cry
of
vengeance
and
étienne
had
to
cry
still
louder
to
mirou
there
are
traitors
down
there
to
mirou
to
mirou
with
a
gesture
he
had
turned
the
crowd
towards
the
left
road
while
jeanlin
going
ahead
was
blowing
louder
than
ever
an
eddy
was
produced
in
the
crowd
this
time
was
saved
and
the
four
kilometres
which
separated
them
from
mirou
were
traversed
in
half
an
hour
almost
at
running
pace
across
the
interminable
plain
the
canal
on
this
side
cut
it
with
a
long
icy
ribbon
the
leafless
trees
on
the
banks
changed
by
the
frost
into
giant
candelabra
alone
broke
this
pale
uniformity
prolonged
and
lost
in
the
sky
at
the
horizon
as
in
a
sea
an
undulation
of
the
ground
hid
montsou
and
marchiennes
there
was
nothing
but
bare
immensity
they
reached
the
pit
and
found
a
captain
standing
on
a
at
the
to
receive
them
they
all
well
knew
father
quandieu
the
of
the
montsou
captains
an
old
man
whose
skin
and
hair
were
quite
white
and
who
was
in
his
seventies
a
miracle
of
fine
health
in
the
mines
what
have
you
come
after
here
you
pack
of
meddlers
he
shouted
the
band
stopped
it
was
no
longer
a
master
it
was
a
mate
and
a
certain
respect
held
them
back
before
this
old
workman
there
are
men
down
below
said
étienne
make
them
come
up
yes
there
are
men
there
said
father
quandieu
some
six
dozen
the
others
were
afraid
of
you
evil
beggars
but
i
warn
you
that
not
one
comes
up
or
you
will
have
to
deal
with
me
exclamations
arose
the
men
pushed
the
women
advanced
quickly
coming
down
from
the
the
captain
now
barred
the
door
then
maheu
tried
to
interfere
it
is
our
right
old
man
how
can
we
make
the
strike
general
if
we
do
force
all
the
mates
to
be
on
our
side
the
old
man
was
silent
a
moment
evidently
his
ignorance
on
the
subject
of
coalition
equalled
the
pikeman
at
last
he
replied
it
may
be
your
right
i
do
say
but
i
only
know
my
orders
i
am
alone
here
the
men
are
down
till
three
and
they
shall
stay
there
till
three
the
last
words
were
lost
in
hooting
fists
were
threateningly
advanced
the
women
deafened
him
and
their
hot
breath
blew
in
his
face
but
he
still
held
out
his
head
erect
and
his
beard
and
hair
white
as
snow
his
courage
had
so
swollen
his
voice
that
he
could
be
heard
distinctly
over
the
tumult
by
god
you
shall
not
pass
as
true
as
the
sun
shines
i
would
rather
die
than
let
you
touch
the
cables
do
push
any
more
or
i
damned
if
i
do
fling
myself
down
the
shaft
before
you
the
crowd
drew
back
shuddering
and
impressed
he
went
on
where
is
the
beast
who
does
not
understand
that
i
am
only
a
workman
like
you
others
i
have
been
told
to
guard
here
and
i
guarding
that
was
as
far
as
father
quandieu
intelligence
went
stiffened
by
his
obstinacy
of
military
duty
his
narrow
skull
and
eyes
dimmed
by
the
black
melancholy
of
half
a
century
spent
underground
the
men
looked
at
him
moved
feeling
within
them
an
echo
of
what
he
said
this
military
obedience
the
sense
of
fraternity
and
resignation
in
danger
he
saw
that
they
were
hesitating
still
and
repeated
i
damned
if
i
do
fling
myself
down
the
shaft
before
you
a
great
recoil
carried
away
the
mob
they
all
turned
and
in
the
rush
took
the
road
which
stretched
far
away
through
the
fields
again
cries
arose
to
madeleine
to
crévecoeur
no
more
work
bread
bread
but
in
the
centre
as
they
went
on
there
was
hustling
it
was
chaval
they
said
who
was
trying
to
take
advantage
of
an
opportunity
to
escape
étienne
had
seized
him
by
the
arm
threatening
to
do
for
him
if
he
was
planning
some
treachery
and
the
other
struggled
and
protested
furiously
what
all
this
for
is
a
man
free
i
been
freezing
the
last
hour
i
want
to
clean
myself
let
me
go
he
was
in
fact
suffering
from
the
coal
glued
to
his
skin
by
sweat
and
his
woollen
garment
was
no
protection
on
you
go
or
we
clean
you
replied
étienne
do
expect
to
get
your
life
at
a
bargain
they
were
still
running
and
he
turned
towards
catherine
who
was
keeping
up
well
it
annoyed
him
to
feel
her
so
near
him
so
miserable
shivering
beneath
her
man
old
jacket
and
her
muddy
trousers
she
must
be
nearly
dead
of
fatigue
she
was
running
all
the
same
you
can
go
off
you
can
he
said
at
last
catherine
seemed
not
to
hear
her
eyes
on
meeting
étienne
only
flamed
with
reproach
for
a
moment
she
did
not
stop
why
did
he
want
her
to
leave
her
man
chaval
was
not
at
all
kind
it
was
true
he
would
even
beat
her
sometimes
but
he
was
her
man
the
one
who
had
had
her
first
and
it
enraged
her
that
they
should
throw
themselves
on
him
more
than
a
thousand
of
them
she
would
have
defended
him
without
any
tenderness
at
all
out
of
pride
off
you
go
repeated
maheu
violently
her
father
order
slackened
her
course
for
a
moment
she
trembled
and
her
eyelids
swelled
with
tears
then
in
spite
of
her
fear
she
came
back
to
the
same
place
again
still
running
then
they
let
her
be
the
mob
crossed
the
joiselle
road
went
a
short
distance
up
the
cron
road
and
then
mounted
towards
cougny
on
this
side
factory
chimneys
striped
the
flat
horizon
wooden
sheds
brick
workshops
with
large
dusty
windows
appeared
along
the
street
they
passed
one
after
another
the
low
buildings
of
two
settlements
that
of
the
then
that
of
the
and
from
each
of
them
at
the
sound
of
the
horn
and
the
clamour
arising
from
every
mouth
whole
families
came
out
men
women
and
children
running
to
join
their
mates
in
the
rear
when
they
came
up
to
madeleine
there
were
at
least
fifteen
hundred
the
road
descended
in
a
gentle
slope
the
rumbling
flood
of
strikers
had
to
turn
round
the
before
they
could
spread
over
the
mine
square
it
was
now
not
more
than
two
but
the
captains
had
been
warned
and
were
hastening
the
ascent
as
the
band
arrived
the
men
were
all
up
only
some
twenty
remained
and
were
now
disembarking
from
the
cage
they
fled
and
were
pursued
with
stones
two
were
struck
another
left
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
behind
this
saved
the
material
and
neither
the
cables
nor
the
boilers
were
touched
the
flood
was
already
moving
away
rolling
on
towards
the
next
pit
this
one
crévecoeur
was
only
five
hundred
metres
away
from
madeleine
there
also
the
mob
arrived
in
the
midst
of
the
ascent
a
was
taken
and
whipped
by
the
women
with
her
breeches
split
open
and
her
buttocks
exposed
before
the
laughing
men
the
had
their
ears
boxed
the
pikemen
got
away
their
sides
blue
from
blows
and
their
noses
bleeding
and
in
this
growing
ferocity
in
this
old
need
of
revenge
which
was
turning
every
head
with
madness
the
choked
cries
went
on
death
to
traitors
hatred
against
work
the
roaring
of
bellies
after
bread
they
began
to
cut
the
cables
but
the
file
would
not
bite
and
the
task
was
too
long
now
that
the
fever
was
on
them
for
moving
onward
for
ever
onward
at
the
boilers
a
tap
was
broken
while
the
water
thrown
by
bucketsful
into
the
stoves
made
the
metal
gratings
burst
outside
they
were
talking
of
marching
on
this
was
the
best
disciplined
pit
the
strike
had
not
touched
it
nearly
seven
hundred
men
must
have
gone
down
there
this
exasperated
them
they
would
wait
for
these
men
with
sticks
ranged
for
battle
just
to
see
who
would
get
the
best
of
it
but
the
rumour
ran
along
that
there
were
gendarmes
at
the
gendarmes
of
the
morning
whom
they
had
made
fun
of
how
was
this
known
nobody
could
say
no
matter
they
were
seized
by
fear
and
decided
on
their
giddiness
carried
them
on
all
were
on
the
road
clanking
their
sabots
rushing
forward
to
to
the
cowards
there
were
certainly
four
hundred
in
number
and
there
would
be
fun
situated
three
kilometres
away
this
pit
lay
in
a
fold
of
the
ground
near
the
scarpe
they
were
already
climbing
the
slope
of
the
platriéres
beyond
the
road
to
beaugnies
when
a
voice
no
one
knew
from
whom
threw
out
the
idea
that
the
soldiers
were
perhaps
down
there
at
then
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
column
it
was
repeated
that
the
soldiers
were
down
there
they
slackened
their
march
panic
gradually
spread
in
the
country
idle
without
work
which
they
had
been
scouring
for
hours
why
had
they
not
come
across
any
soldiers
this
impunity
troubled
them
at
the
thought
of
the
repression
which
they
felt
to
be
coming
without
any
one
knowing
where
it
came
from
a
new
word
of
command
turned
them
towards
another
pit
to
the
victoire
to
the
victoire
were
there
then
neither
soldiers
nor
police
at
the
victoire
nobody
knew
all
seemed
reassured
and
turning
round
they
descended
from
the
beaumont
side
and
cut
across
the
fields
to
reach
the
joiselle
road
the
railway
line
barred
their
passage
and
they
crossed
it
pulling
down
the
palings
now
they
were
approaching
montsou
the
gradual
undulation
of
the
landscape
grew
less
the
sea
of
beetroot
fields
enlarged
reaching
far
away
to
the
black
houses
at
marchiennes
this
time
it
was
a
march
of
five
good
kilometres
so
strong
an
impulse
pushed
them
on
that
they
had
no
feeling
of
their
terrible
fatigue
or
of
their
bruised
and
wounded
feet
the
rear
continued
to
lengthen
increased
by
mates
enlisted
on
the
roads
and
in
the
settlements
when
they
had
passed
the
canal
at
the
magache
bridge
and
appeared
before
the
victoire
there
were
two
thousand
of
them
but
three
had
struck
the
ascent
was
completed
not
a
man
remained
below
their
disappointment
was
spent
in
vain
threats
they
could
only
heave
broken
bricks
at
the
workmen
who
had
arrived
to
take
their
duty
at
the
there
was
a
rush
and
the
deserted
pit
belonged
to
them
and
in
their
rage
at
not
finding
a
traitor
face
to
strike
they
attacked
things
a
rankling
abscess
was
bursting
within
them
a
poisoned
boil
of
slow
growth
years
and
years
of
hunger
tortured
them
with
a
thirst
for
massacre
and
destruction
behind
a
shed
étienne
saw
some
porters
filling
a
wagon
with
coal
will
you
just
clear
out
of
the
bloody
place
he
shouted
not
a
bit
of
coal
goes
out
at
his
orders
some
hundred
strikers
ran
up
and
the
porters
only
had
time
to
escape
men
unharnessed
the
horses
which
were
frightened
and
set
off
struck
in
the
haunches
while
others
overturning
the
wagon
broke
the
shafts
levaque
with
violent
blows
of
his
axe
had
thrown
himself
on
the
platforms
to
break
down
the
they
resisted
and
it
occurred
to
him
to
tear
up
the
rails
destroying
the
line
from
one
end
of
the
square
to
the
other
soon
the
whole
band
set
to
this
task
maheu
made
the
metal
chairs
leap
up
armed
with
his
iron
bar
which
he
used
as
a
lever
during
this
time
mother
brulé
led
away
the
women
and
invaded
the
lamp
cabin
where
their
sticks
covered
the
soil
with
a
carnage
of
lamps
maheude
carried
out
of
herself
was
laying
about
her
as
vigorously
as
the
levaque
woman
all
were
soaked
in
oil
and
mouquette
dried
her
hands
on
her
skirt
laughing
to
find
herself
so
dirty
jeanlin
for
a
joke
had
emptied
a
lamp
down
her
neck
but
all
this
revenge
produced
nothing
to
eat
stomachs
were
crying
out
louder
than
ever
and
the
great
lamentation
dominated
still
bread
bread
bread
a
former
captain
at
the
victoire
kept
a
stall
near
by
no
doubt
he
had
fled
in
fear
for
his
shed
was
abandoned
when
the
women
came
back
and
the
men
had
finished
destroying
the
railway
they
besieged
the
stall
the
shutters
of
which
yielded
at
once
they
found
no
bread
there
there
were
only
two
pieces
of
raw
flesh
and
a
sack
of
potatoes
but
in
the
pillage
they
discovered
some
fifty
bottles
of
gin
which
disappeared
like
a
drop
of
water
drunk
up
by
the
sand
étienne
having
emptied
his
tin
was
able
to
refill
it
little
by
little
a
terrible
drunkenness
the
drunkenness
of
the
starved
was
inflaming
his
eyes
and
baring
his
teeth
like
a
wolf
between
his
pallid
lips
suddenly
he
perceived
that
chaval
had
gone
off
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
he
swore
and
men
ran
to
seize
the
fugitive
who
was
hiding
with
catherine
behind
the
timber
supply
ah
you
dirty
swine
you
are
afraid
of
getting
into
trouble
shouted
étienne
it
was
you
in
the
forest
who
called
for
a
strike
of
the
to
stop
the
pumps
and
now
you
want
to
play
us
a
filthy
trick
very
well
by
god
we
will
go
back
to
i
will
have
you
smash
the
pump
yes
by
god
you
shall
smash
it
he
was
drunk
he
was
urging
his
men
against
this
pump
which
he
had
saved
a
few
hours
earlier
to
to
they
all
cheered
and
rushed
on
while
chaval
seized
by
the
shoulders
was
drawn
and
pushed
violently
along
while
he
constantly
asked
to
be
allowed
to
will
you
take
yourself
off
then
cried
maheu
to
catherine
who
had
also
begun
to
run
again
this
time
she
did
not
even
draw
back
but
turned
her
burning
eyes
on
her
father
and
went
on
running
once
more
the
mob
ploughed
through
the
flat
plain
they
were
retracing
their
steps
over
the
long
straight
paths
by
the
fields
endlessly
spread
out
it
was
four
the
sun
which
approached
the
horizon
lengthened
the
shadows
of
this
horde
with
their
furious
gestures
over
the
frozen
soil
they
avoided
montsou
and
farther
on
rejoined
the
joiselle
road
to
spare
the
journey
round
they
passed
beneath
the
walls
of
piolaine
the
grégoires
had
just
gone
out
having
to
visit
a
lawyer
before
going
to
dine
with
the
hennebeaus
where
they
would
find
cécile
the
estate
seemed
asleep
with
its
avenue
of
deserted
limes
its
kitchen
garden
and
its
orchard
bared
by
the
winter
nothing
was
stirring
in
the
house
and
the
closed
windows
were
dulled
by
the
warm
steam
within
out
of
the
profound
silence
an
impression
of
comfort
arose
the
patriarchal
sensation
of
good
beds
and
a
good
table
the
wise
happiness
of
the
proprietor
existence
without
stopping
the
band
cast
gloomy
looks
through
the
grating
and
at
the
length
of
protecting
walls
bristling
with
broken
bottles
the
cry
arose
again
bread
bread
bread
the
dogs
alone
replied
by
barking
ferociously
a
pair
of
great
danes
with
rough
coats
who
stood
with
open
jaws
and
behind
the
closed
blind
there
were
only
the
servants
mélanie
the
cook
and
honorine
the
housemaid
attracted
by
this
cry
pale
and
perspiring
with
fear
at
seeing
these
savages
go
by
they
fell
on
their
knees
and
thought
themselves
killed
on
hearing
a
single
stone
breaking
a
pane
of
a
neighbouring
window
it
was
a
joke
of
jeanlin
he
had
manufactured
a
sling
with
a
piece
of
cord
and
had
just
sent
a
little
passing
greeting
to
the
grégoires
already
he
was
again
blowing
his
horn
the
band
was
lost
in
the
distance
and
the
cry
grew
fainter
bread
bread
bread
they
arrived
at
in
still
greater
numbers
more
than
two
thousand
five
hundred
madmen
breaking
everything
sweeping
away
everything
with
the
force
of
a
torrent
which
gains
strength
as
it
moves
the
police
had
passed
here
an
hour
earlier
and
had
gone
off
towards
led
astray
by
some
peasants
in
their
haste
they
had
not
even
taken
the
precaution
of
leaving
a
few
men
behind
to
guard
the
pit
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
fires
were
overturned
the
boilers
emptied
the
buildings
torn
down
and
devastated
but
it
was
the
pump
which
they
specially
threatened
it
was
not
enough
to
stop
it
in
the
last
expiring
breath
of
its
steam
they
threw
themselves
on
it
as
on
a
living
person
whose
life
they
required
the
first
blow
is
yours
repeated
étienne
putting
a
hammer
into
chaval
hand
come
you
have
sworn
with
the
others
chaval
drew
back
trembling
and
in
the
hustling
the
hammer
fell
while
other
men
without
waiting
battered
the
pump
with
blows
from
iron
bars
blows
from
bricks
blows
from
anything
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
some
even
broke
sticks
over
it
the
nuts
leapt
off
the
pieces
of
steel
and
copper
were
dislocated
like
torn
limbs
the
blow
of
a
shovel
delivered
with
full
force
fractured
the
metal
body
the
water
escaped
and
emptied
itself
and
there
was
a
supreme
gurgle
like
an
agonizing
that
was
the
end
and
the
mob
found
themselves
outside
again
madly
pushing
on
behind
étienne
who
would
not
let
chaval
go
kill
him
the
traitor
to
the
shaft
to
the
shaft
the
livid
wretch
clinging
with
imbecile
obstinacy
to
his
fixed
idea
continued
to
stammer
his
need
of
cleaning
himself
wait
if
that
bothers
you
said
the
levaque
woman
here
here
a
bucket
there
was
a
pond
there
an
infiltration
of
the
water
from
the
pump
it
was
white
with
a
thick
layer
of
ice
and
they
struck
it
and
broke
the
ice
forcing
him
to
dip
his
head
in
this
cold
water
duck
then
repeated
mother
brulé
by
god
if
you
do
duck
shove
you
in
and
now
you
shall
have
a
drink
of
it
yes
yes
like
a
beast
with
your
jaws
in
the
trough
he
had
to
drink
on
all
fours
they
all
laughed
with
cruel
laughter
one
woman
pulled
his
ears
another
woman
threw
in
his
face
a
handful
of
dung
found
fresh
on
the
road
his
old
woollen
jacket
in
tatters
no
longer
held
together
he
was
haggard
stumbling
and
with
struggling
movements
of
his
hips
he
tried
to
flee
maheu
had
pushed
him
and
maheude
was
among
those
who
grew
furious
both
of
them
satisfying
their
old
spite
even
mouquette
who
generally
remained
such
good
friends
with
her
old
lovers
was
wild
with
this
one
treating
him
as
a
and
talking
of
taking
his
breeches
down
to
see
if
he
was
still
a
man
étienne
made
her
hold
her
tongue
that
enough
there
no
need
for
all
to
set
to
it
if
you
like
you
we
will
just
settle
it
together
his
fists
closed
and
his
eyes
were
lit
up
with
homicidal
fury
his
intoxication
was
turning
into
the
desire
to
kill
are
you
ready
one
of
us
must
stay
here
give
him
a
knife
i
got
mine
catherine
exhausted
and
terrified
gazed
at
him
she
remembered
his
confidences
his
desire
to
devour
a
man
when
he
had
drunk
poisoned
after
the
third
glass
to
such
an
extent
had
his
drunkards
of
parents
put
this
beastliness
into
his
body
suddenly
she
leapt
forward
struck
him
with
both
her
woman
hands
and
choking
with
indignation
shouted
into
his
face
coward
coward
coward
is
it
enough
then
all
these
abominations
you
want
to
kill
him
now
that
he
ca
stand
upright
any
longer
she
turned
towards
her
father
and
her
mother
she
turned
towards
the
others
you
are
cowards
cowards
kill
me
then
with
him
i
will
tear
your
eyes
out
i
will
if
you
touch
him
again
oh
the
cowards
and
she
planted
herself
before
her
man
to
defend
him
forgetting
the
blows
forgetting
the
life
of
misery
lifted
up
by
the
idea
that
she
belonged
to
him
since
he
had
taken
her
and
that
it
was
a
shame
for
her
when
they
so
crushed
him
étienne
had
grown
pale
beneath
this
girl
blows
at
first
he
had
been
about
to
knock
her
down
then
after
having
wiped
his
face
with
the
movement
of
a
man
who
is
recovering
from
intoxication
he
said
to
chaval
in
the
midst
of
deep
silence
she
is
right
that
enough
off
you
go
immediately
chaval
was
away
and
catherine
galloped
behind
him
the
crowd
gazed
at
them
as
they
disappeared
round
a
corner
of
the
road
but
maheude
muttered
you
were
wrong
ought
to
have
kept
him
he
is
sure
to
be
after
some
treachery
but
the
mob
began
to
march
on
again
five
was
about
to
strike
the
sun
as
red
as
a
furnace
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
seemed
to
set
fire
to
the
whole
plain
a
pedlar
who
was
passing
informed
them
that
the
military
were
descending
from
the
crévecoeur
side
then
they
turned
an
order
ran
to
montsou
to
the
manager

chapter
v
hennebeau
had
placed
himself
in
front
of
his
study
window
to
watch
the
departure
of
the
carriage
which
was
taking
away
his
wife
to
lunch
at
marchiennes
his
eyes
followed
négrel
for
a
moment
as
he
trotted
beside
the
carriage
door
then
he
quietly
returned
and
seated
himself
at
his
desk
when
neither
his
wife
nor
his
nephew
animated
the
place
with
their
presence
the
house
seemed
empty
on
this
day
the
coachman
was
driving
his
wife
rose
the
new
housemaid
had
leave
to
go
out
till
five
there
only
remained
hippolyte
the
valet
de
chambre
trailing
about
the
rooms
in
slippers
and
the
cook
who
had
been
occupied
since
dawn
in
struggling
with
her
saucepans
entirely
absorbed
in
the
dinner
which
was
to
be
given
in
the
evening
so
hennebeau
promised
himself
a
day
of
serious
work
in
this
deep
calm
of
the
deserted
house
towards
nine
although
he
had
received
orders
to
send
every
one
away
hippolyte
took
the
liberty
of
announcing
dansaert
who
was
bringing
news
the
manager
then
heard
for
the
first
time
of
the
meeting
in
the
forest
the
evening
before
the
details
were
very
precise
and
he
listened
while
thinking
of
the
intrigue
with
pierronne
so
well
known
that
two
or
three
anonymous
letters
every
week
denounced
the
licentiousness
of
the
head
captain
evidently
the
husband
had
talked
and
no
doubt
the
wife
had
too
he
even
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
he
let
the
head
captain
know
that
he
was
aware
of
everything
contenting
himself
with
recommending
prudence
for
fear
of
a
scandal
startled
by
these
reproaches
in
the
midst
of
his
report
dansaert
denied
stammered
excuses
while
his
great
nose
confessed
the
crime
by
its
sudden
redness
he
did
not
insist
however
glad
to
get
off
so
easily
for
as
a
rule
the
manager
displayed
the
implacable
severity
of
the
virtuous
man
whenever
an
employee
allowed
himself
the
indulgence
of
a
pretty
girl
in
the
pit
the
conversation
continued
concerning
the
strike
that
meeting
in
the
forest
was
only
the
swagger
of
blusterers
nothing
serious
threatened
in
any
case
the
settlements
would
surely
not
stir
for
some
days
beneath
the
impression
of
respectful
fear
which
must
have
been
produced
by
the
military
promenade
of
the
morning
when
hennebeau
was
alone
again
he
was
however
on
the
point
of
sending
a
telegram
to
the
prefect
only
the
fear
of
uselessly
showing
a
sign
of
anxiety
held
him
back
already
he
could
not
forgive
himself
his
lack
of
insight
in
saying
everywhere
and
even
writing
to
the
directors
that
the
strike
would
last
at
most
a
fortnight
it
had
been
going
on
and
on
for
nearly
two
months
to
his
great
surprise
and
he
was
in
despair
over
it
he
felt
himself
every
day
lowered
and
compromised
and
was
forced
to
imagine
some
brilliant
achievement
which
would
bring
him
back
into
favour
with
the
directors
he
had
just
asked
them
for
orders
in
the
case
of
a
skirmish
there
was
delay
over
the
reply
and
he
was
expecting
it
by
the
afternoon
post
he
said
to
himself
that
there
would
be
time
then
to
send
out
telegrams
and
to
obtain
the
military
occupation
of
the
pits
if
such
was
the
desire
of
those
gentlemen
in
his
own
opinion
there
would
certainly
be
a
battle
and
an
expenditure
of
blood
this
responsibility
troubled
him
in
spite
of
his
habitual
energy
up
to
eleven
he
worked
peacefully
there
was
no
sound
in
the
dead
house
except
hippolyte
which
was
rubbing
a
floor
far
away
on
the
first
floor
then
one
after
the
other
he
received
two
messages
the
first
announcing
the
attack
on
by
the
montsou
band
the
second
telling
of
the
cut
cables
the
overturned
fires
and
all
the
destruction
he
could
not
understand
why
had
the
strikers
gone
to
deneulin
instead
of
attacking
one
of
the
company
pits
besides
they
were
quite
welcome
to
sack
vandame
that
would
merely
ripen
the
plan
of
conquest
which
he
was
meditating
and
at
midday
he
lunched
alone
in
the
large
served
so
quietly
by
the
servant
that
he
could
not
even
hear
his
slippers
this
solitude
rendered
his
preoccupations
more
gloomy
he
was
feeling
cold
at
the
heart
when
a
captain
who
had
arrived
running
was
shown
in
and
told
him
of
the
mob
march
on
mirou
almost
immediately
as
he
was
finishing
his
coffee
a
telegram
informed
him
that
madeleine
and
crévecoeur
were
in
their
turn
threatened
then
his
perplexity
became
extreme
he
was
expecting
the
postman
at
two
ought
he
at
once
to
ask
for
troops
or
would
it
be
better
to
wait
patiently
and
not
to
act
until
he
had
received
the
directors
orders
he
went
back
into
his
study
he
wished
to
read
a
report
which
he
had
asked
négrel
to
prepare
the
day
before
for
the
prefect
but
he
could
not
put
his
hand
on
it
he
reflected
that
perhaps
the
young
man
had
left
it
in
his
room
where
he
often
wrote
at
night
and
without
taking
any
decision
pursued
by
the
idea
of
this
report
he
went
upstairs
to
look
for
it
in
the
room
as
he
entered
hennebeau
was
surprised
the
room
had
not
been
done
no
doubt
through
hippolyte
forgetfulness
or
laziness
there
was
a
moist
heat
there
the
close
heat
of
the
past
night
made
heavier
from
the
mouth
of
the
stove
being
left
open
and
he
was
suffocated
too
with
a
penetrating
perfume
which
he
thought
must
be
the
odour
of
the
toilet
waters
with
which
the
basin
was
full
there
was
great
disorder
in
the
room
garments
scattered
about
damp
towels
thrown
on
the
backs
of
chairs
the
bed
yawning
with
a
sheet
drawn
back
and
draggling
on
the
carpet
but
at
first
he
only
glanced
round
with
an
abstracted
look
as
he
went
towards
a
table
covered
with
papers
to
look
for
the
missing
report
twice
he
examined
the
papers
one
by
one
but
it
was
certainly
not
there
where
the
devil
could
that
madcap
paul
have
stuffed
it
and
as
hennebeau
went
back
into
the
middle
of
the
room
giving
a
glance
at
each
article
of
furniture
he
noticed
in
the
open
bed
a
bright
point
which
shone
like
a
star
he
approached
mechanically
and
put
out
his
hand
it
was
a
little
gold
lying
between
two
folds
of
the
sheet
he
at
once
recognized
a
belonging
to
madame
hennebeau
the
little
ether
bottle
which
was
always
with
her
but
he
could
not
understand
its
presence
here
how
could
it
have
got
into
paul
bed
and
suddenly
he
grew
terribly
pale
his
wife
had
slept
there
beg
your
pardon
sir
murmured
hippolyte
voice
through
the
door
i
saw
you
going
up
the
servant
entered
and
was
thrown
into
consternation
by
the
disorder
lord
why
the
room
is
not
done
so
rose
has
gone
out
leaving
all
the
house
on
my
shoulders
hennebeau
had
hidden
the
bottle
in
his
hand
and
was
pressing
it
almost
to
breaking
what
do
you
want
it
another
man
sir
he
has
come
from
crévecoeur
with
a
letter
good
leave
me
alone
tell
him
to
wait
his
wife
had
slept
there
when
he
had
bolted
the
door
he
opened
his
hand
again
and
looked
at
the
little
bottle
which
had
left
its
image
in
red
on
his
flesh
suddenly
he
saw
and
understood
this
filthiness
had
been
going
on
in
his
house
for
months
he
recalled
his
old
suspicion
the
rustling
against
the
doors
the
naked
feet
at
night
through
the
silent
house
yes
it
was
his
wife
who
went
up
to
sleep
there
falling
into
a
chair
opposite
the
bed
which
he
gazed
at
fixedly
he
remained
some
minutes
as
though
crushed
a
noise
aroused
him
someone
was
knocking
at
the
door
trying
to
open
it
he
recognized
the
servant
voice
sir
ah
you
are
shut
in
sir
what
is
it
now
there
seems
to
be
a
hurry
the
men
are
breaking
everything
there
are
two
more
messengers
below
there
are
also
some
telegrams
you
just
leave
me
alone
i
am
coming
directly
the
idea
that
hippolyte
would
himself
have
discovered
the
had
he
done
the
room
in
the
morning
had
just
frozen
him
and
besides
this
man
must
know
he
must
have
found
the
bed
still
hot
with
adultery
twenty
times
over
with
madame
hairs
trailing
on
the
pillow
and
abominable
traces
staining
the
linen
the
man
kept
interrupting
him
and
it
could
only
be
out
of
inquisitiveness
perhaps
he
had
stayed
with
his
ear
stuck
to
the
door
excited
by
the
debauchery
of
his
masters
hennebeau
did
not
move
he
still
gazed
at
the
bed
his
long
past
of
suffering
unrolled
before
him
his
marriage
with
this
woman
their
immediate
misunderstanding
of
the
heart
and
of
the
flesh
the
lovers
whom
she
had
had
unknown
to
him
and
the
lover
whom
he
had
tolerated
for
ten
years
as
one
tolerates
an
impure
taste
in
a
sick
woman
then
came
their
arrival
at
montsou
the
mad
hope
of
curing
her
months
of
languor
of
sleepy
exile
the
approach
of
old
age
which
would
perhaps
at
last
give
her
back
to
him
then
their
nephew
arrived
this
paul
to
whom
she
became
a
mother
and
to
whom
she
spoke
of
her
dead
heart
buried
for
ever
beneath
the
ashes
and
he
the
imbecile
husband
foresaw
nothing
he
adored
this
woman
who
was
his
wife
whom
other
men
had
possessed
but
whom
he
alone
could
not
possess
he
adored
her
with
shameful
passion
so
that
he
would
have
fallen
on
his
knees
if
she
would
but
have
given
him
the
leavings
of
other
men
the
leavings
of
the
others
she
gave
to
this
child
the
sound
of
a
distant
gong
at
this
moment
made
hennebeau
start
he
recognized
it
it
was
struck
by
his
orders
when
the
postman
arrived
he
rose
and
spoke
aloud
breaking
into
the
flood
of
coarseness
with
which
his
parched
throat
was
bursting
in
spite
of
himself
ah
i
do
care
a
bloody
hang
for
their
telegrams
and
their
letters
not
a
bloody
hang
now
he
was
carried
away
by
rage
the
need
of
some
sewer
in
which
to
stamp
down
all
this
filthiness
with
his
heels
this
woman
was
a
vulgar
drab
he
sought
for
crude
words
and
buffeted
her
image
with
them
the
sudden
idea
of
the
marriage
between
cécile
and
paul
which
she
was
arranging
with
so
quiet
a
smile
completed
his
exasperation
there
was
then
not
even
passion
not
even
jealousy
at
the
bottom
of
this
persistent
sensuality
it
was
now
a
perverse
plaything
the
habit
of
the
woman
a
recreation
taken
like
an
accustomed
dessert
and
he
put
all
the
responsibility
on
her
he
regarded
as
almost
innocent
the
lad
at
whom
she
had
bitten
in
this
reawakening
of
appetite
just
as
one
bites
at
an
early
green
fruit
stolen
by
the
wayside
whom
would
she
devour
on
whom
would
she
fall
when
she
no
longer
had
complaisant
nephews
sufficiently
practical
to
accept
in
their
own
family
the
table
the
bed
and
the
wife
there
was
a
timid
scratch
at
the
door
and
hippolyte
allowed
himself
to
whisper
through
the
keyhole
the
postman
sir
and
monsieur
dansaert
too
has
come
back
saying
that
they
are
killing
one
another
i
coming
down
good
god
what
should
he
do
to
them
chase
them
away
on
their
return
from
marchiennes
like
stinking
animals
whom
he
would
no
longer
have
beneath
his
roof
he
would
take
a
cudgel
and
would
tell
them
to
carry
elsewhere
their
poisonous
coupling
it
was
with
their
sighs
with
their
mixed
breaths
that
the
damp
warmth
of
this
room
had
grown
heavy
the
penetrating
odour
which
had
suffocated
him
was
the
odour
of
musk
which
his
wife
skin
exhaled
another
perverse
taste
a
fleshly
need
of
violent
perfumes
and
he
seemed
to
feel
also
the
heat
and
odour
of
fornication
of
living
adultery
in
the
pots
which
lay
about
in
the
basins
still
full
in
the
disorder
of
the
linen
of
the
furniture
of
the
entire
room
tainted
with
vice
the
fury
of
impotence
threw
him
on
to
the
bed
which
he
struck
with
his
fists
belabouring
the
places
where
he
saw
the
imprint
of
their
two
bodies
enraged
with
the
disordered
coverlets
and
the
crumpled
sheets
soft
and
inert
beneath
his
blows
as
though
exhausted
themselves
by
the
embraces
of
the
whole
night
but
suddenly
he
thought
he
heard
hippolyte
coming
up
again
he
was
arrested
by
shame
for
a
moment
he
stood
panting
wiping
his
forehead
calming
the
bounds
of
his
heart
standing
before
a
mirror
he
looked
at
his
face
so
changed
that
he
did
not
recognize
himself
then
when
he
had
watched
it
gradually
grow
calmer
by
an
effort
of
supreme
will
he
went
downstairs
five
messengers
were
standing
below
not
counting
dansaert
all
brought
him
news
of
increasing
gravity
concerning
the
march
of
the
strikers
among
the
pits
and
the
chief
captain
told
him
at
length
what
had
gone
on
at
mirou
and
the
fine
behaviour
of
father
quandieu
he
listened
nodding
his
head
but
he
did
not
hear
his
thoughts
were
in
the
room
upstairs
at
last
he
sent
them
away
saying
that
he
would
take
due
measures
when
he
was
alone
again
seated
before
his
desk
he
seemed
to
grow
drowsy
with
his
head
between
his
hands
covering
his
eyes
his
mail
was
there
and
he
decided
to
look
for
the
expected
letter
the
directors
reply
the
lines
at
first
danced
before
him
but
he
understood
at
last
that
these
gentlemen
desired
a
skirmish
certainly
they
did
not
order
him
to
make
things
worse
but
they
allowed
it
to
be
seen
that
disturbances
would
hasten
the
conclusion
of
the
strike
by
provoking
energetic
repression
after
this
he
no
longer
hesitated
but
sent
off
telegrams
on
all
sides
to
the
prefect
of
lille
to
the
corps
of
soldiery
at
douai
to
the
police
at
marchiennes
it
was
a
relief
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
shut
himself
in
he
even
spread
the
report
that
he
was
suffering
from
gout
and
all
the
afternoon
he
hid
himself
in
his
study
receiving
no
one
contenting
himself
with
reading
the
telegrams
and
letters
which
continued
to
rain
in
he
thus
followed
the
mob
from
afar
from
madeleine
to
crévecoeur
from
crévecoeur
to
the
victoire
from
the
victoire
to
information
also
reached
him
of
the
bewilderment
of
the
police
and
the
troops
wandering
along
the
roads
and
always
with
their
backs
to
the
pit
attacked
they
might
kill
one
another
and
destroy
everything
he
put
his
head
between
his
hands
again
with
his
fingers
over
his
eyes
and
buried
himself
in
the
deep
silence
of
the
empty
house
where
he
only
heard
now
and
then
the
noise
of
the
cook
saucepans
as
she
bustled
about
preparing
the
dinner
the
twilight
was
already
darkening
the
room
it
was
five
when
a
disturbance
made
hennebeau
jump
as
he
sat
dazed
and
inert
with
his
elbows
in
his
papers
he
thought
that
it
was
the
two
wretches
coming
back
but
the
tumult
increased
and
a
terrible
cry
broke
out
just
as
he
was
going
to
the
window
bread
bread
bread
it
was
the
strikers
now
invading
montsou
while
the
police
expecting
an
attack
on
the
voreux
were
galloping
off
in
the
opposite
direction
to
occupy
that
pit
just
then
two
kilometres
away
from
the
first
houses
a
little
beyond
the
crossways
where
the
main
road
cut
the
vandame
road
madame
hennebeau
and
the
young
ladies
had
witnessed
the
passing
of
the
mob
the
day
had
been
spent
pleasantly
at
marchiennes
there
had
been
a
delightful
lunch
with
the
manager
of
the
forges
then
an
interesting
visit
to
the
workshops
and
to
the
neighbouring
glass
works
to
occupy
the
afternoon
and
as
they
were
now
going
home
in
the
limpid
decline
of
the
beautiful
winter
day
cécile
had
had
the
whim
to
drink
a
glass
of
milk
as
she
noticed
a
little
farm
near
the
edge
of
the
road
they
all
then
got
down
from
the
carriage
and
négrel
gallantly
leapt
off
his
horse
while
the
alarmed
by
all
these
fine
people
rushed
about
and
spoke
of
laying
a
cloth
before
serving
the
milk
but
lucie
and
jeanne
wanted
to
see
the
cow
milked
and
they
went
into
the
with
their
cups
making
a
little
rural
party
and
laughing
greatly
at
the
litter
in
which
one
sank
madame
hennebeau
with
her
complacent
maternal
air
was
drinking
with
the
edge
of
her
lips
when
a
strange
roaring
noise
from
without
disturbed
her
what
is
that
then
the
built
at
the
edge
of
the
road
had
a
large
door
for
carts
for
it
was
also
used
as
a
barn
for
hay
the
young
girls
who
had
put
out
their
heads
were
astonished
to
see
on
the
left
a
black
flood
a
shouting
band
which
was
moving
along
the
vandame
road
the
deuce
muttered
négrel
who
had
also
gone
out
are
our
brawlers
getting
angry
at
last
it
is
perhaps
the
colliers
again
said
the
this
is
twice
they
passed
seems
things
are
not
going
well
they
masters
of
the
country
she
uttered
every
word
prudently
watching
the
effect
on
their
faces
and
when
she
noticed
the
fright
of
all
of
them
and
their
deep
anxiety
at
this
encounter
she
hastened
to
conclude
oh
the
rascals
the
rascals
négrel
seeing
that
it
was
too
late
to
get
into
their
carriage
and
reach
montsou
ordered
the
coachman
to
bring
the
vehicle
into
the
farmyard
where
it
would
remain
hidden
behind
a
shed
he
himself
fastened
his
horse
which
a
lad
had
been
holding
beneath
the
shed
when
he
came
back
he
found
his
aunt
and
the
young
girls
distracted
and
ready
to
follow
the
who
proposed
that
they
should
take
refuge
in
her
house
but
he
was
of
opinion
that
they
would
be
safer
where
they
were
for
certainly
no
one
would
come
and
look
for
them
in
the
hay
the
door
however
shut
very
badly
and
had
such
large
chinks
in
it
that
the
road
could
be
seen
between
the
planks
come
courage
he
said
we
will
sell
our
lives
dearly
this
joke
increased
their
fear
the
noise
grew
louder
but
nothing
could
yet
be
seen
along
the
vacant
road
the
wind
of
a
tempest
seemed
to
be
blowing
like
those
sudden
gusts
which
precede
great
storms
no
no
i
do
want
to
look
said
cécile
going
to
hide
herself
in
the
hay
madame
hennebeau
who
was
very
pale
and
felt
angry
with
these
people
who
had
spoilt
her
pleasure
stood
in
the
background
with
a
sidelong
look
of
repugnance
while
lucie
and
jeanne
though
trembling
had
placed
their
eyes
at
a
crack
anxious
to
lose
nothing
of
the
spectacle
a
sound
of
thunder
came
near
the
earth
was
shaken
and
jeanlin
galloped
up
first
blowing
into
his
horn
take
out
your
the
sweat
of
the
people
is
passing
by
murmured
négrel
who
in
spite
of
his
republican
convictions
liked
to
make
fun
of
the
populace
when
he
was
with
ladies
but
this
witticism
was
carried
away
in
the
hurricane
of
gestures
and
cries
the
women
had
appeared
nearly
a
thousand
of
them
with
outspread
hair
dishevelled
by
running
the
naked
skin
appearing
through
their
rags
the
nakedness
of
females
weary
with
giving
birth
to
starvelings
a
few
held
their
little
ones
in
their
arms
raising
them
and
shaking
them
like
banners
of
mourning
and
vengeance
others
who
were
younger
with
the
swollen
breasts
of
amazons
brandished
sticks
while
frightful
old
women
were
yelling
so
loudly
that
the
cords
of
their
fleshless
necks
seemed
to
be
breaking
and
then
the
men
came
up
two
thousand
madmen
trammers
pikemen
menders
a
compact
mass
which
rolled
along
like
a
single
block
in
confused
serried
rank
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
their
faded
trousers
or
ragged
woollen
jackets
all
effaced
in
the
same
earthy
uniformity
their
eyes
were
burning
and
one
only
distinguished
the
holes
of
black
mouths
singing
the
the
stanzas
were
lost
in
a
confused
roar
accompanied
by
the
clang
of
sabots
over
the
hard
earth
above
their
heads
amid
the
bristling
iron
bars
an
axe
passed
by
carried
erect
and
this
single
axe
which
seemed
to
be
the
standard
of
the
band
showed
in
the
clear
air
the
sharp
profile
of
a
what
atrocious
faces
stammered
madame
hennebeau
négrel
said
between
his
teeth
devil
take
me
if
i
can
recognize
one
of
them
where
do
the
bandits
spring
from
and
in
fact
anger
hunger
these
two
months
of
suffering
and
this
enraged
through
the
pits
had
lengthened
the
placid
faces
of
the
montsou
colliers
into
the
muzzles
of
wild
beasts
at
this
moment
the
sun
was
setting
its
last
rays
of
sombre
purple
cast
a
gleam
of
blood
over
the
plain
the
road
seemed
to
be
full
of
blood
men
and
women
continued
to
rush
by
bloody
as
butchers
in
the
midst
of
slaughter
oh
superb
whispered
lucie
and
jeanne
stirred
in
their
artistic
tastes
by
the
beautiful
horror
of
it
they
were
frightened
however
and
drew
back
close
to
madame
hennebeau
who
was
leaning
on
a
trough
she
was
frozen
at
the
thought
that
a
glance
between
the
planks
of
that
disjointed
door
might
suffice
to
murder
them
négrel
also
who
was
usually
very
brave
felt
himself
grow
pale
seized
by
a
terror
that
was
superior
to
his
will
the
terror
which
comes
from
the
unknown
cécile
in
the
hay
no
longer
stirred
and
the
others
in
spite
of
the
wish
to
turn
away
their
eyes
could
not
do
so
they
were
compelled
to
gaze
it
was
the
red
vision
of
the
revolution
which
would
one
day
inevitably
carry
them
all
away
on
some
bloody
evening
at
the
end
of
the
century
yes
some
evening
the
people
unbridled
at
last
would
thus
gallop
along
the
roads
making
the
blood
of
the
middle
class
flow
parading
severed
heads
and
sprinkling
gold
from
disembowelled
coffers
the
women
would
yell
the
men
would
have
those
jaws
open
to
bite
yes
the
same
rags
the
same
thunder
of
great
sabots
the
same
terrible
troop
with
dirty
skins
and
tainted
breath
sweeping
away
the
old
world
beneath
an
overflowing
flood
of
barbarians
fires
would
flame
they
would
not
leave
standing
one
stone
of
the
towns
they
would
return
to
the
savage
life
of
the
woods
after
the
great
rut
the
great
when
the
poor
in
one
night
would
emaciate
the
wives
and
empty
the
cellars
of
the
rich
there
would
be
nothing
left
not
a
sou
of
the
great
fortunes
not
a
of
properties
acquired
until
the
day
dawned
when
a
new
earth
would
perhaps
spring
up
once
more
yes
it
was
these
things
which
were
passing
along
the
road
it
was
the
force
of
nature
herself
and
they
were
receiving
the
terrible
wind
of
it
in
their
faces
a
great
cry
arose
dominating
the
bread
bread
bread
lucie
and
jeanne
pressed
themselves
against
madame
hennebeau
who
was
almost
fainting
while
négrel
placed
himself
before
them
as
though
to
protect
them
by
his
body
was
the
old
social
order
cracking
this
very
evening
and
what
they
saw
immediately
after
completed
their
stupefaction
the
band
had
nearly
passed
by
there
were
only
a
few
stragglers
left
when
mouquette
came
up
she
was
delaying
watching
the
bourgeois
at
their
garden
gates
or
the
windows
of
their
houses
and
whenever
she
saw
them
as
she
was
not
able
to
spit
in
their
faces
she
showed
them
what
for
her
was
the
climax
of
contempt
doubtless
she
perceived
someone
now
for
suddenly
she
raised
her
skirts
bent
her
back
and
showed
her
enormous
buttocks
naked
beneath
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
there
was
nothing
obscene
in
those
fierce
buttocks
and
nobody
laughed
everything
disappeared
the
flood
rolled
on
to
montsou
along
the
turns
of
the
road
between
the
low
houses
streaked
with
bright
colours
the
carriage
was
drawn
out
of
the
yard
but
the
coachman
would
not
take
it
upon
him
to
convey
back
madame
and
the
young
ladies
without
delay
the
strikers
occupied
the
street
and
the
worst
was
there
was
no
other
road
we
must
go
back
however
for
dinner
will
be
ready
said
madame
hennebeau
exasperated
by
annoyance
and
fear
these
dirty
workpeople
have
again
chosen
a
day
when
i
have
visitors
how
can
you
do
good
to
such
creatures
lucie
and
jeanne
were
occupied
in
pulling
cécile
out
of
the
hay
she
was
struggling
believing
that
those
savages
were
still
passing
by
and
repeating
that
she
did
not
want
to
see
them
at
last
they
all
took
their
places
in
the
carriage
again
it
then
occurred
to
négrel
who
had
remounted
that
they
might
go
through
the
réquillart
lanes
go
gently
he
said
to
the
coachman
for
the
road
is
atrocious
if
any
groups
prevent
you
from
returning
to
the
road
over
there
you
can
stop
behind
the
old
pit
and
we
will
return
on
foot
through
the
little
garden
door
while
you
can
put
up
the
carriage
and
horses
anywhere
in
some
inn
outhouse
they
set
out
the
band
far
away
was
streaming
into
montsou
as
they
had
twice
seen
police
and
military
the
inhabitants
were
agitated
and
seized
by
panic
abominable
stories
were
circulating
it
was
said
that
written
placards
had
been
set
up
threatening
to
rip
open
the
bellies
of
the
bourgeois
nobody
had
read
them
but
all
the
same
they
were
able
to
quote
the
exact
words
at
the
lawyer
especially
the
terror
was
at
its
height
for
he
had
just
received
by
post
an
anonymous
letter
warning
him
that
a
barrel
of
powder
was
buried
in
his
cellar
and
that
it
would
be
blown
up
if
he
did
not
declare
himself
on
the
side
of
the
people
just
then
the
grégoires
prolonging
their
visit
on
the
arrival
of
this
letter
were
discussing
it
and
decided
that
it
must
be
the
work
of
a
joker
when
the
invasion
of
the
mob
completed
the
terror
of
the
house
they
however
smiled
drawing
back
a
corner
of
the
curtain
to
look
out
and
refused
to
admit
that
there
was
any
danger
certain
they
said
that
all
would
finish
up
well
five
struck
and
they
had
time
to
wait
until
the
street
was
free
for
them
to
cross
the
road
to
dine
with
the
hennebeaus
where
cécile
who
had
surely
returned
must
be
waiting
for
them
but
no
one
in
montsou
seemed
to
share
their
confidence
people
were
wildly
running
about
doors
and
windows
were
banged
to
they
saw
maigrat
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
barricading
his
shop
with
a
large
supply
of
iron
bars
and
looking
so
pale
and
trembling
that
his
feeble
little
wife
was
obliged
to
fasten
the
screws
the
band
had
come
to
a
halt
before
the
manager
villa
and
the
cry
echoed
bread
bread
bread
hennebeau
was
standing
at
the
window
when
hippolyte
came
in
to
close
the
shutters
for
fear
the
windows
should
be
broken
by
stones
he
closed
all
on
the
ground
floor
and
then
went
up
to
the
first
floor
the
creak
of
the
was
heard
and
the
clack
of
the
shutters
one
by
one
unfortunately
it
was
not
possible
to
shut
the
kitchen
window
in
the
area
in
the
same
way
a
window
made
disquietingly
ruddy
by
the
gleams
from
the
saucepans
and
the
spit
mechanically
hennebeau
who
wished
to
look
out
went
up
to
room
on
the
second
floor
it
was
on
the
left
the
best
situated
for
it
commanded
the
road
as
far
as
the
company
yards
and
he
stood
behind
the
blinds
overlooking
the
crowd
but
this
room
had
again
overcome
him
the
toilet
table
sponged
and
in
order
the
cold
bed
with
neat
and
sheets
all
his
rage
of
the
afternoon
that
furious
battle
in
the
depths
of
his
silent
solitude
had
now
turned
to
an
immense
fatigue
his
whole
being
was
now
like
this
room
grown
cold
swept
of
the
filth
of
the
morning
returned
to
its
habitual
correctness
what
was
the
good
of
a
scandal
had
anything
really
changed
in
his
house
his
wife
had
simply
taken
another
lover
that
she
had
chosen
him
in
the
family
scarcely
aggravated
the
fact
perhaps
even
it
was
an
advantage
for
she
thus
preserved
appearances
he
pitied
himself
when
he
thought
of
his
mad
jealousy
how
ridiculous
to
have
struck
that
bed
with
his
fists
since
he
had
tolerated
another
man
he
could
certainly
tolerate
this
one
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
little
more
contempt
a
terrible
bitterness
was
poisoning
his
mouth
the
uselessness
of
everything
the
eternal
pain
of
existence
shame
for
himself
who
always
adored
and
desired
this
woman
in
the
dirt
in
which
he
had
abandoned
her
beneath
the
window
the
yells
broke
out
with
increased
violence
bread
bread
bread
idiots
said
hennebeau
between
his
clenched
teeth
he
heard
them
abusing
him
for
his
large
salary
calling
him
a
bloated
idler
a
bloody
beast
who
stuffed
himself
to
indigestion
with
good
things
while
the
worker
was
dying
of
hunger
the
women
had
noticed
the
kitchen
and
there
was
a
tempest
of
imprecations
against
the
pheasant
roasting
there
against
the
sauces
that
with
fat
odours
irritated
their
empty
stomachs
ah
the
stinking
bourgeois
they
should
be
stuffed
with
champagne
and
truffles
till
their
guts
burst
bread
bread
bread
idiots
repeated
hennebeau
am
i
happy
anger
arose
in
him
against
these
people
who
could
not
understand
he
would
willingly
have
made
them
a
present
of
his
large
salary
to
possess
their
hard
skin
and
their
facility
of
coupling
without
regret
why
could
he
not
seat
them
at
his
table
and
stuff
them
with
his
pheasant
while
he
went
to
fornicate
behind
the
hedges
to
tumble
the
girls
over
making
fun
of
those
who
had
tumbled
them
over
before
him
he
would
have
given
everything
his
education
his
comfort
his
luxury
his
power
as
manager
if
he
could
be
for
one
day
the
vilest
of
the
wretches
who
obeyed
him
free
of
his
flesh
enough
of
a
blackguard
to
beat
his
wife
and
to
take
his
pleasure
with
his
neighbours
wives
and
he
longed
also
to
be
dying
of
hunger
to
have
an
empty
belly
a
stomach
twisted
by

that
would
make
his

turn
with
giddiness
perhaps
that
would
have
killed
the
eternal
pain
ah
to
live
like
a
brute
to
possess
nothing
to
scour
the
fields
with
the
ugliest
and
dirtiest
putter
and
to
be
able
to
be
happy

bread
bread
then
he
grew
angry
and
shouted
furiously
in
the
tumult
bread
is
that
enough
idiots
he
could
eat
and
all
the
same
he
was
groaning
with
torment
his
desolate
household
his
whole
wounded
life
choked
him
at
the
throat
like
a
death
agony
things
were
not
all
for
the
best
because
one
had
bread
who
was
the
fool
who
placed
earthly
happiness
in
the
partition
of

these
revolutionary
dreamers
might
demolish
society
and
rebuilt
another
society
they
would
not
add
one
joy
to
humanity
they
would
not
take
away
one
pain
by
cutting
for
everybody
they
would
even
enlarge
the
unhappiness
of
the
earth
they
would
one
day
make
the
very
dogs
howl
with
despair
when
they
had
taken
them
out
of
the
tranquil
satisfaction
of
instinct
to
raise
them
to
the
unappeasable
suffering
of
passion
no
the
one
good
thing
was
not
to
exist
and
if
one
existed
to
be
a

a

still
a
grain
of
sand
which
can
not
bleed
beneath
the

in
this
exasperation
of
his
torment
tears
swelled
in
hennebeau
eyes
and
broke
in
burning
drops
on
his
cheeks
the
twilight
was
drowning
the
road
when
stones
began
to
riddle
the
front
of
the
villa
with
no
anger
now
against
these
starving
people
only
enraged
by
the
burning
wound
at
his
heart
he
continued
to
stammer
in
the
midst
of
his

idiots

the
cry
of

dominated
and
a
roar
blew

étienne
had
remained
at
the
head
of
his
mates
but
while
he
was
hoarsely
urging
them
on
to
montsou
he
heard
another
voice
within
him
the
voice
of
reason
asking
in
astonishment
the
meaning
of
all
this
he
had
not
intended
any
of
these
things
how
had
it
happened
that
having
set
out
for
with
the
object
of
acting
calmly
and
preventing
disaster
he
had
finished
this
day
of
increasing
violence
by
besieging
the
manager
villa
he
it
certainly
was
however
who
had
just
cried
halt
only
at
first
his
sole
idea
had
been
to
protect
the
company
yards
which
there
had
been
talk
of
sacking
and
now
that
stones
were
already
grazing
the
facade
of
the
villa
he
sought
in
vain
for
some
lawful
prey
on
which
to
throw
the
band
so
as
to
avoid
greater
misfortunes
as
he
thus
stood
alone
powerless
in
the
middle
of
the
road
he
was
called
by
a
man
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
estaminet
tison
where
the
landlady
had
just
put
up
the
shutters
in
haste
leaving
only
the
door
free
yes
it
me
will
you
listen
it
was
rasseneur
some
thirty
men
and
women
nearly
all
belonging
to
the
settlement
of
the
who
had
remained
at
home
in
the
morning
and
had
come
in
the
evening
for
news
had
invaded
this
estaminet
on
the
approach
of
the
strikers
zacharie
occupied
a
table
with
his
wife
philoméne
farther
on
pierron
and
pierronne
with
their
backs
turned
were
hiding
their
faces
no
one
was
drinking
they
had
simply
taken
shelter
étienne
recognized
rasseneur
and
was
turning
away
when
the
latter
added
you
do
want
to
see
me
eh
i
warned
you
things
are
getting
awkward
now
you
may
ask
for
bread
they
give
you
lead
then
étienne
came
back
and
replied
what
troubles
me
is
the
cowards
who
fold
their
arms
and
watch
us
risking
our
skins
your
notion
then
is
to
pillage
over
there
asked
rasseneur
my
notion
is
to
remain
to
the
last
with
our
friends
quit
by
dying
together
in
despair
étienne
went
back
into
the
crowd
ready
to
die
on
the
road
three
children
were
throwing
stones
and
he
gave
them
a
good
kick
shouting
out
to
his
comrades
that
it
was
no
good
breaking
windows
bébert
and
lydie
who
had
rejoined
jeanlin
were
learning
from
him
how
to
work
the
sling
they
each
sent
a
flint
playing
at
who
could
do
the
most
damage
lydie
had
awkwardly
cracked
the
head
of
a
woman
in
the
crowd
and
the
two
boys
were
loudly
laughing
bonnemort
and
mouque
seated
on
a
bench
were
gazing
at
them
behind
bonnemort
swollen
legs
bore
him
so
badly
that
he
had
great
difficulty
in
dragging
himself
so
far
no
one
knew
what
curiosity
impelled
him
for
his
face
had
the
earthy
look
of
those
days
when
he
never
spoke
a
word
nobody
however
any
longer
obeyed
étienne
the
stones
in
spite
of
his
orders
went
on
hailing
and
he
was
astonished
and
terrified
by
these
brutes
he
had
unmuzzled
who
were
so
slow
to
move
and
then
so
terrible
so
ferociously
tenacious
in
their
rage
all
the
old
flemish
blood
was
there
heavy
and
placid
taking
months
to
get
heated
and
then
giving
itself
up
to
abominable
savagery
listening
to
nothing
until
the
beast
was
glutted
by
atrocities
in
his
southern
land
crowds
flamed
up
more
quickly
but
they
did
not
effect
so
much
he
had
to
struggle
with
levaque
to
obtain
possession
of
his
axe
and
he
knew
not
how
to
keep
back
the
maheus
who
were
throwing
flints
with
both
hands
the
women
especially
terrified
him
the
levaque
mouquette
and
the
others
who
were
agitated
by
murderous
fury
with
teeth
and
nails
out
barking
like
bitches
and
driven
on
by
mother
brulé
whose
lean
figure
dominated
them
but
there
was
a
sudden
stop
a
moment
surprise
brought
a
little
of
that
calmness
which
étienne
supplications
could
not
obtain
it
was
simply
the
grégoires
who
had
decided
to
bid
farewell
to
the
lawyer
and
to
cross
the
road
to
the
manager
house
and
they
seemed
so
peaceful
they
so
clearly
had
the
air
of
believing
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
joke
on
the
part
of
their
worthy
miners
whose
resignation
had
nourished
them
for
a
century
that
the
latter
in
fact
left
off
throwing
stones
for
fear
of
hitting
this
old
gentleman
and
old
lady
who
had
fallen
from
the
sky
they
allowed
them
to
enter
the
garden
mount
the
steps
and
ring
at
the
barricaded
door
which
was
by
no
means
opened
in
a
hurry
just
then
rose
the
housemaid
was
returning
laughing
at
the
furious
workmen
all
of
whom
she
knew
for
she
belonged
to
montsou
and
it
was
she
who
by
striking
her
fists
against
the
door
at
last
forced
hippolyte
to
set
it
ajar
it
was
time
for
as
the
grégoires
disappeared
the
hail
of
stones
began
again
recovering
from
its
astonishment
the
crowd
was
shouting
louder
than
ever
death
to
the
bourgeois
hurrah
for
the
people
rose
went
on
laughing
in
the
hall
of
the
villa
as
though
amused
by
the
adventure
and
repeated
to
the
terrified
they
not
i
know
them
grégoire
methodically
hung
up
his
hat
then
when
he
had
assisted
madame
grégoire
to
draw
off
her
thick
cloth
mantle
he
said
in
his
turn
certainly
they
have
no
malice
at
bottom
when
they
have
shouted
well
they
will
go
home
to
supper
with
more
appetite
at
this
moment
hennebeau
came
down
from
the
second
floor
he
had
seen
the
scene
and
came
to
receive
his
guests
in
his
usual
cold
and
polite
manner
the
pallor
of
his
face
alone
revealed
the
grief
which
had
shaken
him
the
man
was
tamed
there
only
remained
in
him
the
correct
administrator
resolved
to
do
his
duty
you
know
he
said
the
ladies
have
not
yet
come
back
for
the
first
time
some
anxiety
disturbed
the
grégoires
cécile
not
come
back
how
could
she
come
back
now
if
the
miners
were
to
prolong
their
joking
i
thought
of
having
the
place
cleared
added
hennebeau
but
the
misfortune
is
that
i
alone
here
and
besides
i
do
not
know
where
to
send
my
servant
to
bring
me
four
men
and
a
corporal
to
clear
away
this
mob
rose
who
had
remained
there
ventured
to
murmur
anew
oh
sir
they
are
not
the
manager
shook
his
head
while
the
tumult
increased
outside
and
they
could
hear
the
dull
crash
of
the
stones
against
the
house
i
do
wish
to
be
hard
on
them
i
can
even
excuse
them
one
must
be
as
foolish
as
they
are
to
believe
that
we
are
anxious
to
injure
them
but
it
is
my
duty
to
prevent
disturbance
to
think
that
there
are
police
all
along
the
roads
as
i
am
told
and
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
a
single
man
since
the
morning
he
interrupted
himself
and
drew
back
before
madame
grégoire
saying
let
me
beg
you
madame
do
not
stay
here
come
into
the
but
the
cook
coming
up
from
below
in
exasperation
kept
them
in
the
hall
a
few
minutes
longer
she
declared
that
she
could
no
longer
accept
any
responsibility
for
the
dinner
for
she
was
expecting
from
the
marchiennes
pastrycook
some
crusts
which
she
had
ordered
for
four
the
pastrycook
had
evidently
turned
aside
on
the
road
for
fear
of
these
bandits
perhaps
they
had
even
pillaged
his
hampers
she
saw
the
blockaded
behind
a
bush
besieged
going
to
swell
the
bellies
of
the
three
thousand
wretches
who
were
asking
for
bread
in
any
case
monsieur
was
warned
she
would
rather
pitch
her
dinner
into
the
fire
if
it
was
to
be
spoilt
because
of
the
revolt
patience
patience
said
hennebeau
all
is
not
lost
the
pastrycook
may
come
and
as
he
turned
toward
madame
grégoire
opening
the
door
himself
he
was
much
surprised
to
observe
seated
on
the
hall
bench
a
man
whom
he
had
not
distinguished
before
in
the
deepening
shade
what
you
maigrat
what
is
it
then
maigrat
arose
his
fat
pale
face
was
changed
by
terror
he
no
longer
possessed
his
usual
calm
stolidity
he
humbly
explained
that
he
had
slipped
into
the
manager
house
to
ask
for
aid
and
protection
should
the
brigands
attack
his
shop
you
see
that
i
am
threatened
myself
and
that
i
have
no
one
replied
hennebeau
you
would
have
done
better
to
stay
at
home
and
guard
your
property
oh
i
have
put
up
iron
bars
and
left
my
wife
there
the
manager
showed
impatience
and
did
not
conceal
his
contempt
a
fine
guard
that
poor
creature
worn
out
by
blows
well
i
can
do
nothing
you
must
try
to
defend
yourself
i
advise
you
to
go
back
at
once
for
there
they
are
again
demanding
bread
listen
in
fact
the
tumult
began
again
and
maigrat
thought
he
heard
his
own
name
in
the
midst
of
the
cries
to
go
back
was
no
longer
possible
they
would
have
torn
him
to
pieces
besides
the
idea
of
his
ruin
overcame
him
he
pressed
his
face
to
the
glass
panel
of
the
door
perspiring
and
trembling
in
anticipation
of
disaster
while
the
grégoires
decided
to
go
into
the
hennebeau
quietly
endeavoured
to
do
the
honours
of
his
house
but
in
vain
he
begged
his
guests
to
sit
down
the
close
barricaded
room
lighted
by
two
lamps
in
the
daytime
was
filled
with
terror
at
each
new
clamour
from
without
amid
the
stuffy
hangings
the
fury
of
the
mob
rolled
more
disturbingly
with
vague
and
terrible
menace
they
talked
however
constantly
brought
back
to
this
inconceivable
revolt
he
was
astonished
at
having
foreseen
nothing
and
his
information
was
so
defective
that
he
specially
talked
against
rasseneur
whose
detestable
influence
he
said
he
was
able
to
recognize
besides
the
gendarmes
would
come
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
be
thus
abandoned
as
to
the
grégoires
they
only
thought
about
their
daughter
the
poor
darling
who
was
so
quickly
frightened
perhaps
in
face
of
the
peril
the
carriage
had
returned
to
marchiennes
they
waited
on
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
worn
out
by
the
noise
in
the
street
and
by
the
sound
of
the
stones
from
time
to
time
striking
the
closed
shutters
which
rang
out
like
gongs
the
situation
was
no
longer
bearable
hennebeau
spoke
of
going
out
to
chase
away
the
brawlers
by
himself
and
to
meet
the
carriage
when
hippolyte
appeared
exclaiming
sir
sir
here
is
madame
they
are
killing
madame
the
carriage
had
not
been
able
to
pass
through
the
threatening
groups
in
the
réquillart
lane
négrel
had
carried
out
his
idea
walking
the
hundred
metres
which
separated
them
from
the
house
and
knocking
at
the
little
door
which
led
to
the
garden
near
the
common
the
gardener
would
hear
them
for
there
was
always
someone
there
to
open
and
at
first
things
had
gone
perfectly
madame
hennebeau
and
the
young
ladies
were
already
knocking
when
some
women
who
had
been
warned
rushed
into
the
lane
then
everything
was
spoilt
the
door
was
not
opened
and
négrel
in
vain
sought
to
burst
it
open
with
his
shoulder
the
rush
of
women
increased
and
fearing
they
would
be
carried
away
he
adopted
the
desperate
method
of
pushing
his
aunt
and
the
girls
before
him
in
order
to
reach
the
front
steps
by
passing
through
the
besiegers
but
this
manoeuvre
led
to
a
hustling
they
were
not
left
free
a
shouting
band
followed
them
while
the
crowd
floated
up
to
right
and
to
left
without
understanding
simply
astonished
at
these
ladies
lost
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
at
this
moment
the
confusion
was
so
great
that
it
led
to
one
of
those
curious
mistakes
which
can
never
be
explained
lucie
and
jeanne
reached
the
steps
and
slipped
in
through
the
door
which
the
housemaid
opened
madame
hennebeau
had
succeeded
in
following
them
and
behind
them
négrel
at
last
came
in
and
then
bolted
the
door
feeling
sure
that
he
had
seen
cécile
go
in
first
she
was
no
longer
there
having
disappeared
on
the
way
so
carried
away
by
fear
that
she
had
turned
her
back
to
the
house
and
had
moved
of
her
own
accord
into
the
thick
of
danger
at
once
the
cry
arose
hurrah
for
the
people
death
to
the
bourgeois
to
death
with
them
a
few
of
those
in
the
distance
beneath
the
veil
which
hid
her
face
mistook
her
for
madame
hennebeau
others
said
she
was
a
friend
of
the
manager
wife
the
young
wife
of
a
neighbouring
manufacturer
who
was
execrated
by
his
men
and
besides
it
mattered
little
it
was
her
silk
dress
her
fur
mantle
even
the
white
feather
in
her
hat
which
exasperated
them
she
smelled
of
perfume
she
wore
a
watch
she
had
the
delicate
skin
of
a
lazy
woman
who
had
never
touched
coal
stop
shouted
mother
brulé
we
put
it
on
your
arse
that
lace
the
lazy
sluts
steal
it
from
us
said
the
levaque
they
stick
fur
on
to
their
skins
while
we
are
dying
of
cold
just
strip
her
naked
to
show
her
how
to
live
at
once
mouquette
rushed
forward
yes
yes
whip
her
and
the
women
in
this
savage
rivalry
struggled
and
stretched
out
their
rags
as
though
each
were
trying
to
get
a
morsel
of
this
rich
girl
no
doubt
her
backside
was
not
better
made
than
any
one
else
more
than
one
of
them
were
rotten
beneath
their
gewgaws
this
injustice
had
lasted
quite
long
enough
they
should
be
forced
to
dress
themselves
like
workwomen
these
harlots
who
dared
to
spend
fifty
sous
on
the
washing
of
a
single
petticoat
in
the
midst
of
these
furies
cécile
was
shaking
with
paralysed
legs
stammering
over
and
over
again
the
same
phrase
ladies
please
please
ladies
please
do
hurt
me
but
she
suddenly
uttered
a
shrill
cry
cold
hands
had
seized
her
by
the
neck
the
rush
had
brought
her
near
old
bonnemort
who
had
taken
hold
of
her
he
seemed
drunk
from
hunger
stupefied
by
his
long
misery
suddenly
arousing
himself
from
the
resignation
of
half
a
century
under
the
influence
of
no
one
knew
what
malicious
impulse
after
having
in
the
course
of
his
life
saved
a
dozen
mates
from
death
risking
his
bones
in
and
landslips
he
was
yielding
to
things
which
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
express
compelled
to
do
thus
fascinated
by
this
young
girl
white
neck
and
as
on
this
day
he
had
lost
his
tongue
he
clenched
his
fingers
with
his
air
of
an
old
infirm
animal
ruminating
over
his
recollections
no
no
yelled
the
women
uncover
her
arse
out
with
her
arse
in
the
villa
as
soon
as
they
had
realized
the
mishap
négrel
and
hennebeau
bravely
reopened
the
door
to
run
to
cécile
help
but
the
crowd
was
now
pressing
against
the
garden
railings
and
it
was
not
easy
to
go
out
a
struggle
took
place
here
while
the
grégoires
in
terror
stood
on
the
steps
let
her
be
then
old
man
it
the
piolaine
young
lady
cried
maheude
to
the
grandfather
recognizing
cécile
whose
veil
had
been
torn
off
by
one
of
the
women
on
his
side
étienne
overwhelmed
at
this
retaliation
on
a
child
was
trying
to
force
the
band
to
let
go
their
prey
an
inspiration
came
to
him
he
brandished
the
axe
which
he
had
snatched
from
levaque
hands
to
maigrat
house
by
god
there
bread
in
there
down
to
the
earth
with
maigrat
damned
shed
and
at
random
he
gave
the
first
blow
of
the
axe
against
the
shop
door
some
comrades
had
followed
him
levaque
maheu
and
a
few
others
but
the
women
were
furious
and
cécile
had
fallen
from
bonnemort
fingers
into
mother
brulé
hands
lydie
and
bébert
led
by
jeanlin
had
slipped
on
all
fours
between
her
petticoats
to
see
the
lady
bottom
already
the
women
were
pulling
her
about
her
clothes
were
beginning
to
split
when
a
man
on
horseback
appeared
pushing
on
his
animal
and
using
his
on
those
who
would
not
stand
back
quick
enough
ah
rascals
you
are
going
to
flog
our
daughters
are
you
it
was
deneulin
who
had
come
to
the
rendezvous
for
dinner
he
quickly
jumped
on
to
the
road
took
cécile
by
the
waist
and
with
the
other
hand
manipulating
his
horse
with
remarkable
skill
and
strength
he
used
it
as
a
living
wedge
to
split
the
crowd
which
drew
back
before
the
onset
at
the
railing
the
battle
continued
he
passed
through
however
with
some
bruises
this
unforeseen
assistance
delivered
négrel
and
hennebeau
who
were
in
great
danger
amid
the
oaths
and
blows
and
while
the
young
man
at
last
led
in
the
fainting
cécile
deneulin
protected
the
manager
with
his
tall
body
and
at
the
top
of
the
steps
received
a
stone
which
nearly
put
his
shoulder
out
that
it
he
cried
break
my
bones
now
you
broken
my
engines
he
promptly
pushed
the
door
to
and
a
volley
of
flints
fell
against
it
what
madmen
he
exclaimed
two
seconds
more
and
they
would
have
broken
my
skull
like
an
empty
gourd
there
is
nothing
to
say
to
them
what
could
you
do
they
know
nothing
you
can
only
knock
them
down
in
the
the
grégoires
were
weeping
as
they
watched
cécile
recover
she
was
not
hurt
there
was
not
even
a
scratch
to
be
seen
only
her
veil
was
lost
but
their
fright
increased
when
they
saw
before
them
their
cook
mélanie
who
described
how
the
mob
had
demolished
piolaine
mad
with
fear
she
had
run
to
warn
her
masters
she
had
come
in
when
the
door
was
ajar
at
the
moment
of
the
fray
without
any
one
noticing
her
and
in
her
endless
narrative
the
single
stone
with
which
jeanlin
had
broken
one
became
a
regular
cannonade
which
had
crushed
through
the
walls
then
grégoire
ideas
were
altogether
upset
they
were
murdering
his
daughter
they
were
razing
his
house
to
the
ground
it
was
then
true
that
these
miners
could
bear
him
ill
will
because
he
lived
like
a
worthy
man
on
their
labour
the
housemaid
who
had
brought
in
a
towel
and
some
repeated
all
the
same
it
queer
they
not
madame
hennebeau
seated
and
very
pale
had
not
recovered
from
the
shock
to
her
feelings
and
she
was
only
able
to
find
a
smile
when
négrel
was
complimented
cécile
parents
especially
thanked
the
young
man
and
the
marriage
might
now
be
regarded
as
settled
hennebeau
looked
on
in
silence
turning
from
his
wife
to
this
lover
whom
in
the
morning
he
had
been
swearing
to
kill
then
to
this
young
girl
by
whom
he
would
no
doubt
soon
be
freed
from
him
there
was
no
haste
only
the
fear
remained
with
him
of
seeing
his
wife
fall
lower
perhaps
to
some
lackey
and
you
my
little
darlings
asked
deneulin
of
his
daughters
have
they
broken
any
of
your
bones
lucie
and
jeanne
had
been
much
afraid
but
they
were
pleased
to
have
seen
it
all
they
were
now
laughing
by
george
the
father
went
on
we
had
a
fine
day
if
you
want
a
dowry
you
would
do
well
to
earn
it
yourselves
and
you
may
also
expect
to
have
to
support
me
he
was
joking
but
his
voice
trembled
his
eyes
swelled
with
tears
as
his
two
daughters
threw
themselves
into
his
arms
hennebeau
had
heard
this
confession
of
ruin
a
quick
thought
lit
up
his
face
vandame
would
now
belong
to
montsou
this
was
the
compensation
the
stroke
of
fortune
which
would
bring
him
back
to
favour
with
the
gentlemen
on
the
directorate
at
every
crisis
of
his
existence
he
took
refuge
in
the
strict
execution
of
the
orders
he
had
received
in
the
military
discipline
in
which
he
lived
he
found
his
small
share
of
happiness
but
they
grew
calm
the
fell
back
into
a
weary
peacefulness
with
the
quiet
light
of
its
two
lamps
and
the
warm
stuffiness
of
the
hangings
what
then
was
going
on
outside
the
brawlers
were
silent
and
stones
no
longer
struck
the
house
one
only
heard
deep
full
blows
those
blows
of
the
hatchet
which
one
hears
in
distant
woods
they
wished
to
find
out
and
went
back
into
the
hall
to
venture
a
glance
through
the
glass
panel
of
the
door
even
the
ladies
went
upstairs
to
post
themselves
behind
the
blinds
on
the
first
floor
do
you
see
that
scoundrel
rasseneur
over
there
on
the
threshold
of
the
said
hennebeau
to
deneulin
i
had
guessed
as
much
he
must
be
in
it
it
was
not
rasseneur
however
it
was
étienne
who
was
dealing
blows
from
his
axe
at
maigrat
shop
and
he
went
on
calling
to
the
men
did
not
the
goods
in
there
belong
to
the
colliers
had
they
not
the
right
to
take
back
their
property
from
this
thief
who
had
exploited
them
so
long
who
was
starving
them
at
a
hint
from
the
company
gradually
they
all
left
the
manager
house
and
ran
up
to
pillage
the
neighbouring
shop
the
cry
bread
bread
bread
broke
out
anew
they
would
find
bread
behind
that
door
the
rage
of
hunger
carried
them
away
as
if
they
suddenly
felt
that
they
could
wait
no
longer
without
expiring
on
the
road
such
furious
thrusts
were
made
at
the
door
that
at
every
stroke
of
the
axe
étienne
feared
to
wound
someone
meanwhile
maigrat
who
had
left
the
hall
of
the
manager
house
had
at
first
taken
refuge
in
the
kitchen
but
hearing
nothing
there
he
imagined
some
abominable
attempt
against
his
shop
and
came
up
again
to
hide
behind
the
pump
outside
when
he
distinctly
heard
the
cracking
of
the
door
and
shouts
of
pillage
in
which
his
own
name
was
mixed
it
was
not
a
nightmare
then
if
he
could
not
see
he
could
now
hear
and
he
followed
the
attack
with
ringing
ears
every
blow
struck
him
in
the
heart
a
hinge
must
have
given
way
five
minutes
more
and
the
shop
would
be
taken
the
thing
was
stamped
on
his
brain
in
real
and
terrible
images
the
brigands
rushing
forward
then
the
drawers
broken
open
the
sacks
emptied
everything
eaten
everything
drunk
the
house
itself
carried
away
nothing
left
not
even
a
stick
with
which
he
might
go
and
beg
through
the
villages
no
he
would
never
allow
them
to
complete
his
ruin
he
would
rather
leave
his
life
there
since
he
had
been
here
he
noticed
at
a
window
of
his
house
his
wife
thin
silhouette
pale
and
confused
behind
the
panes
no
doubt
she
was
watching
the
blows
with
her
usual
silent
air
of
a
poor
beaten
creature
beneath
there
was
a
shed
so
placed
that
from
the
villa
garden
one
could
climb
it
from
the
palings
then
it
was
easy
to
get
on
to
the
tiles
up
to
the
window
and
the
idea
of
thus
returning
home
now
pursued
him
in
his
remorse
at
having
left
perhaps
he
would
have
time
to
barricade
the
shop
with
furniture
he
even
invented
other
and
more
heroic
defences
boiling
oil
lighted
petroleum
poured
out
from
above
but
this
love
of
his
property
struggled
against
his
fear
and
he
groaned
in
the
battle
with
cowardice
suddenly
on
hearing
a
deeper
blow
of
the
axe
he
made
up
his
mind
avarice
conquered
he
and
his
wife
would
cover
the
sacks
with
their
bodies
rather
than
abandon
a
single
loaf
almost
immediately
hooting
broke
out
look
look
the
up
there
after
the
cat
after
the
cat
the
mob
had
just
seen
maigrat
on
the
roof
of
the
shed
in
his
fever
of
anxiety
he
had
climbed
the
palings
with
agility
in
spite
of
his
weight
and
without
troubling
over
the
breaking
wood
and
now
he
was
flattening
himself
along
the
tiles
and
endeavouring
to
reach
the
window
but
the
slope
was
very
steep
he
was
incommoded
by
his
stoutness
and
his
nails
were
torn
he
would
have
dragged
himself
up
however
if
he
had
not
begun
to
tremble
with
the
fear
of
stones
for
the
crowd
which
he
could
not
see
continued
to
cry
beneath
him
after
the
cat
after
the
cat
do
for
him
and
suddenly
both
his
hands
let
go
at
once
and
he
rolled
down
like
a
ball
leapt
at
the
gutter
and
fell
across
the
middle
wall
in
such
a
way
that
by
he
rebounded
on
the
side
of
the
road
where
his
skull
was
broken
open
on
the
corner
of
a
stone
pillar
his
brain
had
spurted
out
he
was
dead
his
wife
up
above
pale
and
confused
behind
the
still
looked
out
they
were
stupefied
at
first
étienne
stopped
short
and
the
axe
slipped
from
his
hands
maheu
levaque
and
the
others
forgot
the
shop
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
wall
along
which
a
thin
red
streak
was
slowly
flowing
down
and
the
cries
ceased
and
silence
spread
over
the
growing
darkness
all
at
once
the
hooting
began
again
it
was
the
women
who
rushed
forward
overcome
by
the
drunkenness
of
blood
then
there
is
a
good
god
after
all
ah
the
bloody
beast
he
done
for
they
surrounded
the
still
warm
body
they
insulted
it
with
laughter
abusing
his
fractured
head
the
dirty
chops
hurling
in
the
dead
face
the
long
venom
of
their
starved
lives
i
owed
you
sixty
francs
now
you
paid
thief
said
maheude
enraged
like
the
others
you
wo
refuse
me
credit
any
more
wait
wait
i
must
fatten
you
once
more
with
her
fingers
she
scratched
up
some
earth
took
two
handfuls
and
stuffed
it
violently
into
his
mouth
there
eat
that
there
eat
eat
you
used
to
eat
us
the
abuse
increased
while
the
dead
man
stretched
on
his
back
gazed
motionless
with
his
large
fixed
eyes
at
the
immense
sky
from
which
the
night
was
falling
this
earth
heaped
in
his
mouth
was
the
bread
he
had
refused
to
give
and
henceforth
he
would
eat
of
no
other
bread
it
had
not
brought
him
luck
to
starve
poor
people
but
the
women
had
another
revenge
to
wreak
on
him
they
moved
round
smelling
him
like
they
were
all
seeking
for
some
outrage
some
savagery
that
would
relieve
them
mother
brulé
shrill
voice
was
heard
cut
him
like
a
yes
yes
after
the
cat
after
the
cat
he
done
too
much
the
dirty
beast
mouquette
was
already
unfastening
and
drawing
off
the
trousers
while
the
levaque
woman
raised
the
legs
and
mother
brulé
with
her
dry
old
hands
separated
the
naked
thighs
and
seized
this
dead
virility
she
took
hold
of
everything
tearing
with
an
effort
which
bent
her
lean
spine
and
made
her
long
arms
crack
the
soft
skin
resisted
she
had
to
try
again
and
at
last
carried
away
the
fragment
a
lump
of
hairy
and
bleeding
flesh
which
she
brandished
with
a
laugh
of
triumph
i
got
it
i
got
it
shrill
voices
saluted
with
curses
the
abominable
trophy
ah
swine
you
wo
fill
our
daughters
any
more
yes
we
done
with
paying
on
your
beastly
body
we
sha
any
more
have
to
offer
a
backside
in
return
for
a
loaf
here
i
owe
you
six
francs
would
you
like
to
settle
it
i
quite
willing
if
you
can
do
it
still
this
joke
shook
them
all
with
terrible
gaiety
they
showed
each
other
the
bleeding
fragment
as
an
evil
beast
from
which
each
of
them
had
suffered
and
which
they
had
at
last
crushed
and
saw
before
them
there
inert
in
their
power
they
spat
on
it
they
thrust
out
their
jaws
saying
over
and
over
again
with
furious
bursts
of
contempt
he
can
do
no
more
he
can
do
no
more
it
no
longer
a
man
that
they
put
away
in
the
earth
go
and
rot
then
mother
brulé
then
planted
the
whole
lump
on
the
end
of
her
stick
and
holding
it
in
the
air
bore
it
about
like
a
banner
rushing
along
the
road
followed
by
the
yelling
troop
of
women
drops
of
blood
rained
down
and
that
pitiful
flesh
hung
like
a
waste
piece
of
meat
on
a
butcher
stall
up
above
at
the
window
madame
maigrat
still
stood
motionless
but
beneath
the
last
gleams
of
the
setting
sun
the
confused
flaws
of
the
distorted
her
white
face
which
looked
as
though
it
were
laughing
beaten
and
deceived
at
every
hour
with
shoulders
bent
from
morning
to
night
over
a
ledger
perhaps
she
was
laughing
while
the
band
of
women
rushed
along
with
that
evil
beast
that
crushed
beast
at
the
end
of
the
stick
this
frightful
mutilation
was
accomplished
in
frozen
horror
neither
étienne
nor
maheu
nor
the
others
had
had
time
to
interfere
they
stood
motionless
before
this
gallop
of
furies
at
the
door
of
the
estaminet
tison
a
few
heads
were
grouped
rasseneur
pale
with
disgust
zacharie
and
philoméne
stupefied
at
what
they
had
seen
the
two
old
men
bonnemort
and
mouque
were
gravely
shaking
their
heads
only
jeanlin
was
making
fun
pushing
bébert
with
his
elbow
and
forcing
lydie
to
look
up
but
the
women
were
already
coming
back
turning
round
and
passing
beneath
the
manager
windows
behind
the
blinds
the
ladies
were
stretching
out
their
necks
they
had
not
been
able
to
observe
the
scene
which
was
hidden
from
them
by
the
wall
and
they
could
not
distinguish
well
in
the
growing
darkness
what
is
it
they
have
at
the
end
of
that
stick
asked
cécile
who
had
grown
bold
enough
to
look
out
lucie
and
jeanne
declared
that
it
must
be
a
no
no
murmured
madame
hennebeau
they
must
have
been
pillaging
a
pork
butcher
it
seems
to
be
a
remnant
of
a
pig
at
this
moment
she
shuddered
and
was
silent
madame
grégoire
had
nudged
her
with
her
knee
they
both
remained
stupefied
the
young
ladies
who
were
very
pale
asked
no
more
questions
but
with
large
eyes
followed
this
red
vision
through
the
darkness
étienne
once
more
brandished
the
axe
but
the
feeling
of
anxiety
did
not
disappear
this
corpse
now
barred
the
road
and
protected
the
shop
many
had
drawn
back
satiety
seemed
to
have
appeased
them
all
maheu
was
standing
by
gloomily
when
he
heard
a
voice
whisper
in
his
ear
to
escape
he
turned
round
and
recognized
catherine
still
in
her
old
overcoat
black
and
panting
with
a
movement
he
repelled
her
he
would
not
listen
to
her
he
threatened
to
strike
her
with
a
gesture
of
despair
she
hesitated
and
then
ran
towards
étienne
save
yourself
save
yourself
the
gendarmes
are
coming
he
also
pushed
her
away
and
abused
her
feeling
the
blood
of
the
blows
she
had
given
him
mounting
to
his
cheeks
but
she
would
not
be
repelled
she
forced
him
to
throw
down
the
axe
and
drew
him
away
by
both
arms
with
irresistible
strength
do
i
tell
you
the
gendarmes
are
coming
listen
to
me
it
chaval
who
has
gone
for
them
and
is
bringing
them
if
you
want
to
know
too
much
for
me
and
i
come
save
yourself
i
do
want
them
to
take
you
and
catherine
drew
him
away
while
at
the
same
instant
a
heavy
gallop
shook
the
street
from
afar
immediately
a
voice
arose
the
gendarmes
the
gendarmes
there
was
a
general
breaking
up
so
mad
a
rush
for
life
that
in
two
minutes
the
road
was
free
absolutely
clear
as
though
swept
by
a
hurricane
maigrat
corpse
alone
made
a
patch
of
shadow
on
the
white
earth
before
the
estaminet
tison
rasseneur
only
remained
feeling
relieved
and
with
open
face
applauding
the
easy
victory
of
the
sabres
while
in
dim
and
deserted
montsou
in
the
silence
of
the
closed
houses
the
bourgeois
remained
with
perspiring
skins
and
chattering
teeth
not
daring
to
look
out
the
plain
was
drowned
beneath
the
thick
night
only
the
blast
furnaces
and
the
coke
furnaces
were
burning
against
the
tragic
sky
the
gallop
of
the
gendarmes
heavily
approached
they
came
up
in
an
indistinguishable
sombre
mass
and
behind
them
the
marchiennes
pastrycook
vehicle
a
little
covered
cart
which
had
been
confided
to
their
care
at
last
arrived
and
a
small
drudge
of
a
boy
jumped
down
and
quietly
unpacked
the
crusts
for
the
part
six
chapter
i
the
first
fortnight
of
february
passed
and
a
black
cold
prolonged
the
hard
winter
without
pity
for
the
poor
once
more
the
authorities
had
scoured
the
roads
the
prefect
of
lille
an
attorney
a
general
and
the
police
were
not
sufficient
the
military
had
come
to
occupy
montsou
a
whole
regiment
of
men
were
camped
between
beaugnies
and
marchiennes
armed
pickets
guarded
the
pits
and
there
were
soldiers
before
every
engine
the
manager
villa
the
company
yards
even
the
houses
of
certain
residents
were
bristling
with
bayonets
nothing
was
heard
along
the
streets
but
the
slow
movement
of
patrols
on
the
of
the
voreux
a
sentinel
was
always
placed
in
the
frozen
wind
that
blew
up
there
like
a
man
above
the
flat
plain
and
every
two
hours
as
though
in
an
enemy
country
were
heard
the
cries
vive
advance
and
give
the
password
nowhere
had
work
been
resumed
on
the
contrary
the
strike
had
spread
crévecoeur
mirou
madeleine
like
the
voreux
were
producing
nothing
at
and
the
victoire
there
were
fewer
men
every
morning
even
at
which
had
been
hitherto
exempt
men
were
wanting
there
was
now
a
silent
persistence
in
the
face
of
this
exhibition
of
force
which
exasperated
the
miners
pride
the
settlements
looked
deserted
in
the
midst
of
the
beetroot
fields
not
a
workman
stirred
only
at
rare
intervals
was
one
to
be
met
by
chance
isolated
with
sidelong
look
lowering
his
head
before
the
red
trousers
and
in
this
deep
melancholy
calm
in
this
passive
opposition
to
the
guns
there
was
a
deceptive
gentleness
a
forced
and
patient
obedience
of
wild
beasts
in
a
cage
with
their
eyes
on
the
tamer
ready
to
spring
on
his
neck
if
he
turned
his
back
the
company
who
were
being
ruined
by
this
death
of
work
talked
of
hiring
miners
from
the
borinage
on
the
belgian
frontier
but
did
not
dare
so
that
the
battle
continued
as
before
between
the
colliers
who
were
shut
up
at
home
and
the
dead
pits
guarded
by
soldiery
on
the
morrow
of
that
terrible
day
this
calm
had
come
about
at
once
hiding
such
a
panic
that
the
greatest
silence
possible
was
kept
concerning
the
damage
and
the
atrocities
the
inquiry
which
had
been
opened
showed
that
maigrat
had
died
from
his
fall
and
the
frightful
mutilation
of
the
corpse
remained
uncertain
already
surrounded
by
a
legend
on
its
side
the
company
did
not
acknowledge
the
disasters
it
had
suffered
any
more
than
the
grégoires
cared
to
compromise
their
daughter
in
the
scandal
of
a
trial
in
which
she
would
have
to
give
evidence
however
some
arrests
took
place
mere
supernumeraries
as
usual
silly
and
frightened
knowing
nothing
by
mistake
pierron
was
taken
off
with
handcuffs
on
his
wrists
as
far
as
marchiennes
to
the
great
amusement
of
his
mates
rasseneur
also
was
nearly
arrested
by
two
gendarmes
the
management
was
content
with
preparing
lists
of
names
and
giving
back
certificates
in
large
numbers
maheu
had
received
his
levaque
also
as
well
as
of
their
mates
in
the
settlement
of
the
alone
and
all
the
severity
was
directed
against
étienne
who
had
disappeared
on
the
evening
of
the
fray
and
who
was
being
sought
although
no
trace
of
him
could
be
found
chaval
in
his
hatred
had
denounced
him
refusing
to
name
the
others
at
catherine
appeal
for
she
wished
to
save
her
parents
the
days
passed
every
one
felt
that
nothing
was
yet
concluded
and
with
oppressed
hearts
every
one
was
awaiting
the
end
at
montsou
during
this
period
the
inhabitants
awoke
with
a
start
every
night
their
ears
buzzing
with
an
imaginary
and
their
nostrils
haunted
by
the
smell
of
powder
but
what
completed
their
discomfiture
was
a
sermon
by
the
new
curé
abbé
ranvier
that
lean
priest
with
eyes
like
coals
who
had
succeeded
abbé
joire
he
was
indeed
unlike
the
smiling
discreet
man
so
fat
and
gentle
whose
only
anxiety
was
to
live
at
peace
with
everybody
abbé
ranvier
went
so
far
as
to
defend
these
abominable
brigands
who
had
dishonoured
the
district
he
found
excuses
for
the
atrocities
of
the
strikers
he
violently
attacked
the
middle
class
throwing
on
them
the
whole
of
the
responsibility
it
was
the
middle
class
which
by
dispossessing
the
church
of
its
ancient
liberties
in
order
to
misuse
them
itself
had
turned
this
world
into
a
cursed
place
of
injustice
and
suffering
it
was
the
middle
class
which
prolonged
misunderstandings
which
was
pushing
on
towards
a
terrible
catastrophe
by
its
atheism
by
its
refusal
to
return
to
the
old
beliefs
to
the
fraternity
of
the
early
christians
and
he
dared
to
threaten
the
rich
he
warned
them
that
if
they
obstinately
persisted
in
refusing
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
god
god
would
surely
put
himself
on
the
side
of
the
poor
he
would
take
back
their
fortunes
from
those
who
faithlessly
enjoyed
them
and
would
distribute
them
to
the
humble
of
the
earth
for
the
triumph
of
his
glory
the
devout
trembled
at
this
the
lawyer
declared
that
it
was
socialism
of
the
worst
kind
all
saw
the
curé
at
the
head
of
a
band
brandishing
a
cross
and
with
vigorous
blows
demolishing
the
bourgeois
society
of
hennebeau
when
informed
contented
himself
with
saying
as
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
he
troubles
us
too
much
the
bishop
will
free
us
from
him
and
while
the
breath
of
panic
was
thus
blowing
from
one
end
of
the
plain
to
the
other
étienne
was
dwelling
beneath
the
earth
in
jeanlin
burrow
at
the
bottom
of
réquillart
it
was
there
that
he
was
in
hiding
no
one
believed
him
so
near
the
quiet
audacity
of
that
refuge
in
the
very
mine
in
that
abandoned
passage
of
the
old
pit
had
baffled
search
above
the
sloes
and
hawthorns
growing
among
the
fallen
scaffolding
of
the
belfry
filled
up
the
mouth
of
the
hole
no
one
ventured
down
it
was
necessary
to
know
the
trick
how
to
hang
on
to
the
roots
of
the
mountain
ash
and
to
let
go
fearlessly
to
catch
hold
of
the
rungs
that
were
still
solid
other
obstacles
also
protected
him
the
suffocating
heat
of
the
passage
a
hundred
and
twenty
metres
of
dangerous
descent
then
the
painful
gliding
on
all
fours
for
a
quarter
of
a
league
between
the
narrowed
walls
of
the
gallery
before
discovering
the
brigand
cave
full
of
plunder
he
lived
there
in
the
midst
of
abundance
finding
gin
there
the
rest
of
the
dried
cod
and
provisions
of
all
sorts
the
large
hay
bed
was
excellent
and
not
a
current
of
air
could
be
felt
in
this
equal
temperature
as
warm
as
a
bath
light
however
threatened
to
fail
jeanlin
who
had
made
himself
purveyor
with
the
prudence
and
discretion
of
a
savage
and
delighted
to
make
fun
of
the
police
had
even
brought
him
pomatum
but
could
not
succeed
in
putting
his
hands
on
a
packet
of
candles
after
the
fifth
day
étienne
never
lighted
up
except
to
eat
he
could
not
swallow
in
the
dark
this
complete
and
interminable
night
always
of
the
same
blackness
was
his
chief
torment
it
was
in
vain
that
he
was
able
to
sleep
in
safety
that
he
was
warm
and
provided
with
bread
the
night
had
never
weighed
so
heavily
on
his
brain
it
seemed
to
him
even
to
crush
his
thoughts
now
he
was
living
on
thefts
in
spite
of
his
communistic
theories
old
scruples
of
education
arose
and
he
contented
himself
with
gnawing
his
share
of
dry
bread
but
what
was
to
be
done
one
must
live
and
his
task
was
not
yet
accomplished
another
shame
overcame
him
remorse
for
that
savage
drunkenness
from
the
gin
drunk
in
the
great
cold
on
an
empty
stomach
which
had
thrown
him
armed
with
a
knife
on
chaval
this
stirred
in
him
the
whole
of
that
unknown
terror
the
hereditary
ill
the
long
ancestry
of
drunkenness
no
longer
tolerating
a
drop
of
alcohol
without
falling
into
homicidal
mania
would
he
then
end
as
a
murderer
when
he
found
himself
in
shelter
in
this
profound
calm
of
the
earth
seized
by
satiety
of
violence
he
had
slept
for
two
days
the
sleep
of
a
brute
gorged
and
overcome
and
the
depression
continued
he
lived
in
a
bruised
state
with
bitter
mouth
and
aching
head
as
after
some
tremendous
spree
a
week
passed
by
the
maheus
who
had
been
warned
were
not
able
to
send
a
candle
he
had
to
give
up
the
enjoyment
of
light
even
when
eating
now
étienne
remained
for
hours
stretched
out
on
his
hay
vague
ideas
were
working
within
him
for
the
first
time
a
feeling
of
superiority
which
placed
him
apart
from
his
mates
an
exaltation
of
his
person
as
he
grew
more
instructed
never
had
he
reflected
so
much
he
asked
himself
the
why
of
his
disgust
on
the
morrow
of
that
furious
course
among
the
pits
and
he
did
not
dare
to
reply
to
himself
his
recollections
were
repulsive
to
him
the
ignoble
desires
the
coarse
instincts
the
odour
of
all
that
wretchedness
shaken
out
to
the
wind
in
spite
of
the
torment
of
the
darkness
he
would
come
to
hate
the
hour
for
returning
to
the
settlement
how
nauseous
were
all
these
wretches
in
a
heap
living
at
the
common
bucket
there
was
not
one
with
whom
he
could
seriously
talk
politics
it
was
a
bestial
existence
always
the
same
air
tainted
by
onion
in
which
one
choked
he
wished
to
enlarge
their
horizon
to
raise
them
to
the
comfort
and
good
manners
of
the
middle
class
by
making
them
masters
but
how
long
it
would
take
and
he
no
longer
felt
the
courage
to
await
victory
in
this
prison
of
hunger
by
slow
degrees
his
vanity
of
leadership
his
constant
preoccupation
of
thinking
in
their
place
left
him
free
breathing
into
him
the
soul
of
one
of
those
bourgeois
whom
he
execrated
jeanlin
one
evening
brought
a
stolen
from
a
lantern
and
this
was
a
great
relief
for
étienne
when
the
darkness
began
to
stupefy
him
weighing
on
his
skull
almost
to
madness
he
would
light
up
for
a
moment
then
as
soon
as
he
had
chased
away
the
nightmare
he
extinguished
the
candle
miserly
of
this
brightness
which
was
as
necessary
to
his
life
as
bread
the
silence
buzzed
in
his
ears
he
only
heard
the
flight
of
a
band
of
rats
the
cracking
of
the
old
timber
the
tiny
sound
of
a
spider
weaving
her
web
and
with
eyes
open
in
this
warm
nothingness
he
returned
to
his
fixed
idea
the
thought
of
what
his
mates
were
doing
above
desertion
on
his
part
would
have
seemed
to
him
the
worst
cowardice
if
he
thus
hid
himself
it
was
to
remain
free
to
give
counsel
or
to
act
his
long
meditations
had
fixed
his
ambition
while
awaiting
something
better
he
would
like
to
be
pluchart
leaving
manual
work
in
order
to
work
only
at
politics
but
alone
in
a
clean
room
under
the
pretext
that
brain
labour
absorbs
the
entire
life
and
needs
quiet
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
week
the
child
having
told
him
that
the
police
supposed
he
had
gone
over
to
belgium
étienne
ventured
out
of
his
hole
at
nightfall
he
wished
to
ascertain
the
situation
and
to
decide
if
it
was
still
well
to
persist
he
himself
considered
the
game
doubtful
before
the
strike
he
felt
uncertain
of
the
result
and
had
simply
yielded
to
facts
and
now
after
having
been
intoxicated
with
rebellion
he
came
back
to
this
first
doubt
despairing
of
making
the
company
yield
but
he
would
not
yet
confess
this
to
himself
he
was
tortured
when
he
thought
of
the
miseries
of
defeat
and
the
heavy
responsibility
of
suffering
which
would
weigh
upon
him
the
end
of
the
strike
was
it
not
the
end
of
his
part
the
overthrow
of
his
ambition
his
life
falling
back
into
the
brutishness
of
the
mine
and
the
horrors
of
the
settlement
and
honestly
without
any
base
calculation
or
falsehood
he
endeavoured
to
find
his
faith
again
to
prove
to
himself
that
resistance
was
still
possible
that
capital
was
about
to
destroy
itself
in
face
of
the
heroic
suicide
of
labour
throughout
the
entire
country
in
fact
there
was
nothing
but
a
long
echo
of
ruin
at
night
when
he
wandered
through
the
black
country
like
a
wolf
who
has
come
out
of
his
forest
he
seemed
to
hear
the
crash
of
bankruptcies
from
one
end
of
the
plain
to
the
other
he
now
passed
by
the
roadside
nothing
but
closed
dead
workshops
becoming
rotten
beneath
the
dull
sky
the
sugar
works
had
especially
suffered
the
hoton
sugar
works
the
fauvelle
works
after
having
reduced
the
number
of
their
hands
had
come
to
grief
one
after
the
other
at
the
dutilleul
flour
works
the
last
mill
had
stopped
on
the
second
saturday
of
the
month
and
the
bleuze
rope
works
for
mine
cables
had
been
quite
ruined
by
the
strike
on
the
marchiennes
side
the
situation
was
growing
worse
every
day
all
the
fires
were
out
at
the
gagebois
glass
works
men
were
continually
being
sent
away
from
the
sonneville
workshops
only
one
of
the
three
blast
furnaces
of
the
forges
was
alight
and
not
one
battery
of
coke
ovens
was
burning
on
the
horizon
the
strike
of
the
montsou
colliers
born
of
the
industrial
crisis
which
had
been
growing
worse
for
two
years
had
increased
it
and
precipitated
the
downfall
to
the
other
causes
of
suffering
the
stoppage
of
orders
from
america
and
the
engorgement
of
invested
capital
in
excessive
production
was
now
added
the
unforeseen
lack
of
coal
for
the
few
furnaces
which
were
still
kept
up
and
that
was
the
supreme
agony
this
engine
bread
which
the
pits
no
longer
furnished
frightened
by
the
general
anxiety
the
company
by
diminishing
its
output
and
starving
its
miners
inevitably
found
itself
at
the
end
of
december
without
a
fragment
of
coal
at
the
surface
of
its
pits
everything
held
together
the
plague
blew
from
afar
one
fall
led
to
another
the
industries
tumbled
each
other
over
as
they
fell
in
so
rapid
a
series
of
catastrophes
that
the
shocks
echoed
in
the
midst
of
the
neighbouring
cities
lille
douai
valenciennes
where
absconding
bankers
were
bringing
ruin
on
whole
families
at
the
turn
of
a
road
étienne
often
stopped
in
the
frozen
night
to
hear
the
rubbish
raining
down
he
breathed
deeply
in
the
darkness
the
joy
of
annihilation
seized
him
the
hope
that
day
would
dawn
on
the
extermination
of
the
old
world
with
not
a
single
fortune
left
standing
the
scythe
of
equality
levelling
everything
to
the
ground
but
in
this
massacre
it
was
the
company
pits
that
especially
interested
him
he
would
continue
his
walk
blinded
by
the
darkness
visiting
them
one
after
the
other
glad
to
discover
some
new
disaster
landslips
of
increasing
gravity
continued
to
occur
on
account
of
the
prolonged
abandonment
of
the
passages
above
the
north
gallery
of
mirou
the
ground
sank
in
to
such
an
extent
that
the
joiselle
road
for
the
distance
of
a
hundred
metres
had
been
swallowed
up
as
though
by
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
and
the
company
disturbed
at
the
rumours
raised
by
these
accidents
paid
the
owners
for
their
vanished
fields
without
bargaining
crévecoeur
and
madeleine
which
lay
in
very
shifting
rock
were
becoming
stopped
up
more
and
more
it
was
said
that
two
captains
had
been
buried
at
the
victoire
there
was
an
inundation
at
it
had
been
necessary
to
wall
up
a
gallery
for
the
length
of
a
kilometre
at
where
the
timbering
was
breaking
down
everywhere
thus
every
hour
enormous
sums
were
spent
making
great
breaches
in
the
shareholders
dividends
a
rapid
destruction
of
the
pits
was
going
on
which
must
end
at
last
by
eating
up
the
famous
montsou
deniers
which
had
been
centupled
in
a
century
in
the
face
of
these
repeated
blows
hope
was
again
born
in
étienne
he
came
to
believe
that
a
third
month
of
resistance
would
crush
the
monster
the
weary
sated
beast
crouching
down
there
like
an
idol
in
his
unknown
tabernacle
he
knew
that
after
the
montsou
troubles
there
had
been
great
excitement
in
the
paris
journals
quite
a
violent
controversy
between
the
official
newspapers
and
the
opposition
newspapers
terrible
narratives
which
were
especially
directed
against
the
international
of
which
the
empire
was
becoming
afraid
after
having
first
encouraged
it
and
the
directors
not
daring
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
any
longer
two
of
them
had
condescended
to
come
and
hold
an
inquiry
but
with
an
air
of
regret
not
appearing
to
care
about
the
upshot
so
disinterested
that
in
three
days
they
went
away
again
declaring
that
everything
was
going
on
as
well
as
possible
he
was
told
however
from
other
quarters
that
during
their
stay
these
gentlemen
sat
permanently
displaying
feverish
activity
and
absorbed
in
transactions
of
which
no
one
about
them
uttered
a
word
and
he
charged
them
with
affecting
confidence
they
did
not
feel
and
came
to
look
upon
their
departure
as
a
nervous
flight
feeling
now
certain
of
triumph
since
these
terrible
men
were
letting
everything
go
but
on
the
following
night
étienne
despaired
again
the
back
was
too
robust
to
be
so
easily
broken
they
might
lose
millions
but
later
on
they
would
get
them
back
again
by
gnawing
at
their
bread
on
that
night
having
pushed
as
far
as
he
guessed
the
truth
when
an
overseer
told
him
that
there
was
talk
of
yielding
vandame
to
montsou
at
deneulin
house
it
was
said
the
wretchedness
was
pitiful
the
wretchedness
of
the
rich
the
father
ill
in
his
powerlessness
aged
by
his
anxiety
over
money
the
daughters
struggling
in
the
midst
of
tradesmen
trying
to
save
their
shifts
there
was
less
suffering
in
the
famished
settlements
than
in
this
house
where
they
shut
themselves
up
to
drink
water
work
had
not
been
resumed
at
and
it
had
been
necessary
to
replace
the
pump
at
while
in
spite
of
all
haste
an
inundation
had
already
begun
which
made
great
expenses
necessary
deneulin
had
at
last
risked
his
request
for
a
loan
of
one
hundred
thousand
francs
from
the
grégoires
and
the
refusal
though
he
had
expected
it
completed
his
dejection
if
they
refused
it
was
for
his
sake
in
order
to
save
him
from
an
impossible
struggle
and
they
advised
him
to
sell
he
as
usual
violently
refused
it
enraged
him
to
have
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
strike
he
hoped
at
first
to
die
of
it
with
the
blood
at
his
head
strangled
by
apoplexy
then
what
was
to
be
done
he
had
listened
to
the
directors
offers
they
wrangled
with
him
they
depreciated
this
superb
prey
this
repaired
pit
equipped
anew
where
the
lack
of
capital
alone
paralysed
the
output
he
would
be
lucky
if
he
got
enough
out
of
it
to
satisfy
his
creditors
for
two
days
he
had
struggled
against
the
directors
at
montsou
furious
at
the
quiet
way
with
which
they
took
advantage
of
his
embarrassment
and
shouting
his
refusals
at
them
in
his
loud
voice
and
there
the
affair
remained
and
they
had
returned
to
paris
to
await
patiently
his
last
groans
étienne
smelled
out
this
compensation
for
the
disasters
and
was
again
seized
by
discouragement
before
the
invincible
power
of
the
great
capitalists
so
strong
in
battle
that
they
fattened
in
defeat
by
eating
the
corpses
of
the
small
capitalists
who
fell
at
their
side
the
next
day
fortunately
jeanlin
brought
him
a
piece
of
good
news
at
the
voreux
the
tubbing
of
the
shaft
was
threatening
to
break
and
the
water
was
filtering
in
from
all
the
joints
in
great
haste
a
gang
of
carpenters
had
been
set
on
to
repair
it
up
to
now
étienne
had
avoided
the
voreux
warned
by
the
everlasting
black
silhouette
of
the
sentinel
stationed
on
the
above
the
plain
he
could
not
be
avoided
he
dominated
in
the
air
like
the
flag
of
the
regiment
towards
three
in
the
morning
the
sky
became
overcast
and
he
went
to
the
pit
where
some
mates
explained
to
him
the
bad
condition
of
the
tubbing
they
even
thought
that
it
would
have
to
be
done
entirely
over
again
which
would
stop
the
output
of
coal
for
three
months
for
a
long
time
he
prowled
round
listening
to
the
carpenters
mallets
hammering
in
the
shaft
that
wound
which
had
to
be
dressed
rejoiced
his
heart
as
he
went
back
in
the
early
daylight
he
saw
the
sentinel
still
on
the
this
time
he
would
certainly
be
seen
as
he
walked
he
thought
about
those
soldiers
who
were
taken
from
the
people
to
be
armed
against
the
people
how
easy
the
triumph
of
the
revolution
would
be
if
the
army
were
suddenly
to
declare
for
it
it
would
be
enough
if
the
workman
and
the
peasant
in
the
barracks
were
to
remember
their
origin
that
was
the
supreme
peril
the
great
terror
which
made
the
teeth
of
the
middle
class
chatter
when
they
thought
of
a
possible
defection
of
the
troops
in
two
hours
they
would
be
swept
away
and
exterminated
with
all
the
delights
and
abominations
of
their
iniquitous
life
it
was
already
said
that
whole
regiments
were
tainted
with
socialism
was
it
true
when
justice
came
would
it
be
thanks
to
the
cartridges
distributed
by
the
middle
class
and
snatching
at
another
hope
the
young
man
dreamed
that
the
regiment
with
its
posts
now
guarding
the
pits
would
come
over
to
the
side
of
the
strikers
shoot
down
the
company
to
a
man
and
at
last
give
the
mine
to
the
miners
he
then
noticed
that
he
was
ascending
the
his
head
filled
with
these
reflections
why
should
he
not
talk
with
this
soldier
he
would
get
to
know
what
his
ideas
were
with
an
air
of
indifference
he
continued
to
come
nearer
as
though
he
were
gleaning
old
wood
among
the
rubbish
the
sentinel
remained
motionless
eh
mate
damned
weather
said
étienne
at
last
i
think
we
shall
have
snow
he
was
a
small
soldier
very
fair
with
a
pale
gentle
face
covered
with
red
freckles
he
wore
his
military
with
the
awkwardness
of
a
recruit
yes
perhaps
we
shall
i
think
he
murmured
and
with
his
blue
eyes
he
gazed
at
the
livid
sky
the
smoky
dawn
with
soot
weighing
like
lead
afar
over
the
plain
what
idiots
they
are
to
put
you
here
to
freeze
étienne
went
on
one
would
think
the
cossacks
were
coming
and
then
there
always
wind
here
the
little
soldier
shivered
without
complaining
there
was
certainly
a
little
cabin
of
dry
stones
there
where
old
bonnemort
used
to
take
shelter
when
it
blew
a
hurricane
but
the
order
being
not
to
leave
the
summit
of
the
the
soldier
did
not
stir
from
it
his
hands
so
stiffened
by
cold
that
he
could
no
longer
feel
his
weapon
he
belonged
to
the
guard
of
sixty
men
who
were
protecting
the
voreux
and
as
this
cruel
frequently
came
round
he
had
before
nearly
stayed
there
for
good
with
his
dead
feet
his
work
demanded
it
a
passive
obedience
finished
the
benumbing
process
and
he
replied
to
these
questions
with
the
stammered
words
of
a
sleepy
child
étienne
in
vain
endeavoured
during
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
make
him
talk
about
politics
he
replied
yes
or
no
without
seeming
to
understand
some
of
his
comrades
said
that
the
captain
was
a
republican
as
to
him
he
had
no
idea
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
if
he
was
ordered
to
fire
he
would
fire
so
as
not
to
be
punished
the
workman
listened
seized
with
the
popular
hatred
against
the
army
against
these
brothers
whose
hearts
were
changed
by
sticking
a
pair
of
red
pantaloons
on
to
their
buttocks
then
what
your
name
jules
and
where
do
you
come
from
from
plogof
over
there
he
stretched
out
his
arm
at
random
it
was
in
brittany
he
knew
no
more
his
small
pale
face
grew
animated
he
began
to
laugh
and
felt
warmer
i
have
a
mother
and
a
sister
they
are
waiting
for
me
sure
enough
ah
it
wo
be
for
when
i
left
they
came
with
me
as
far
as
we
had
to
take
the
horse
to
lepalmec
it
nearly
broke
its
legs
at
the
bottom
of
the
audierne
hill
cousin
charles
was
waiting
for
us
with
sausages
but
the
women
were
crying
too
much
and
it
stuck
in
our
throats
good
lord
what
a
long
way
off
our
home
is
his
eyes
grew
moist
though
he
was
still
laughing
the
desert
moorland
of
plogof
that
wild
point
of
the
raz
appeared
to
him
beneath
a
dazzling
sun
in
the
rosy
season
of
heather
do
you
think
he
asked
if
i
not
punished
that
they
give
me
a
month
leave
in
two
years
then
étienne
talked
about
provence
which
he
had
left
when
he
was
quite
small
the
daylight
was
growing
and
flakes
of
snow
began
to
fly
in
the
earthy
sky
and
at
last
he
felt
anxious
on
noticing
jeanlin
who
was
prowling
about
in
the
midst
of
the
bushes
stupefied
to
see
him
up
there
the
child
was
beckoning
to
him
what
was
the
good
of
this
dream
of
fraternizing
with
the
soldiers
it
would
take
years
and
years
and
his
useless
attempt
cast
him
down
as
though
he
had
expected
to
succeed
but
suddenly
he
understood
jeanlin
gesture
the
sentinel
was
about
to
be
relieved
and
he
went
away
running
off
to
bury
himself
at
réquillart
his
heart
crushed
once
more
by
the
certainty
of
defeat
while
the
little
scamp
who
ran
beside
him
was
accusing
that
dirty
beast
of
a
trooper
of
having
called
out
the
guard
to
fire
at
them
on
the
summit
of
the
jules
stood
motionless
with
eyes
vacantly
gazing
at
the
falling
snow
the
sergeant
was
approaching
with
his
men
and
the
regulation
cries
were
exchanged
vive
advance
and
give
the
password
and
they
heard
the
heavy
steps
begin
again
ringing
as
though
on
a
conquered
country
in
spite
of
the
growing
daylight
nothing
stirred
in
the
settlements
the
colliers
remained
in
silent
rage
beneath
the
military
boot
chapter
ii
snow
had
been
falling
for
two
days
since
the
morning
it
had
ceased
and
an
intense
frost
had
frozen
the
immense
sheet
this
black
country
with
its
inky
roads
and
walls
and
trees
powdered
with
coal
dust
was
now
white
a
single
whiteness
stretching
out
without
end
the
settlement
lay
beneath
the
snow
as
though
it
had
disappeared
no
smoke
came
out
of
the
chimneys
the
houses
without
fire
and
as
cold
as
the
stones
in
the
street
did
not
melt
the
thick
layer
on
the
tiles
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
quarry
of
white
slabs
in
the
white
plain
a
vision
of
a
dead
village
wound
in
its
shroud
along
the
roads
the
passing
patrols
alone
made
a
muddy
mess
with
their
stamping
among
the
maheus
the
last
shovelful
of
cinders
had
been
burnt
the
evening
before
and
it
was
no
use
any
longer
to
think
of
gleaning
on
the
in
this
terrible
weather
when
the
sparrows
themselves
could
not
find
a
blade
of
grass
alzire
from
the
obstinacy
with
which
her
poor
hands
had
dug
in
the
snow
was
dying
maheude
had
to
wrap
her
up
in
the
fragment
of
a
coverlet
while
waiting
for
vanderhaghen
for
whom
she
had
twice
gone
out
without
being
able
to
find
him
the
servant
had
however
promised
that
he
would
come
to
the
settlement
before
night
and
the
mother
was
standing
at
the
window
watching
while
the
little
invalid
who
had
wished
to
be
downstairs
was
shivering
on
a
chair
having
the
illusion
that
it
was
better
there
near
the
cold
grate
old
bonnemort
opposite
his
legs
bad
once
more
seemed
to
be
sleeping
neither
lénore
nor
henri
had
come
back
from
scouring
the
roads
in
company
with
jeanlin
to
ask
for
sous
maheu
alone
was
walking
heavily
up
and
down
the
bare
room
stumbling
against
the
wall
at
every
turn
with
the
stupid
air
of
an
animal
which
can
no
longer
see
its
cage
the
petroleum
also
was
finished
but
the
reflection
of
the
snow
from
outside
was
so
bright
that
it
vaguely
lit
up
the
room
in
spite
of
the
deepening
night
there
was
a
noise
of
sabots
and
the
levaque
woman
pushed
open
the
door
like
a
gale
of
wind
beside
herself
shouting
furiously
from
the
threshold
at
maheude
then
it
you
who
have
said
that
i
forced
my
lodger
to
give
me
twenty
sous
when
he
sleeps
with
me
the
other
shrugged
her
shoulders
do
bother
me
i
said
nothing
and
who
told
you
so
they
tell
me
you
said
so
it
does
concern
you
who
it
was
you
even
said
you
could
hear
us
at
our
dirty
tricks
behind
the
wall
and
that
the
filth
gets
into
our
house
because
i
always
on
my
back
just
tell
me
you
did
say
so
eh
every
day
quarrels
broke
out
as
a
result
of
the
constant
gossiping
of
the
women
especially
between
those
households
which
lived
door
to
door
squabbles
and
reconciliations
took
place
every
day
but
never
before
had
such
bitterness
thrown
them
one
against
the
other
since
the
strike
hunger
exasperated
their
rancour
so
that
they
felt
the
need
of
blows
an
altercation
between
two
gossiping
women
finished
by
a
murderous
onset
between
their
two
men
just
then
levaque
arrived
in
his
turn
dragging
bouteloup
here
our
mate
let
him
just
say
if
he
has
given
twenty
sous
to
my
wife
to
sleep
with
her
the
lodger
hiding
his
timid
gentleness
in
his
great
beard
protested
and
stammered
oh
that
no
never
anything
never
at
once
levaque
became
threatening
and
thrust
his
fist
beneath
nose
you
know
that
wo
do
for
me
if
a
man
got
a
wife
like
that
he
ought
to
knock
her
ribs
in
if
not
then
you
believe
what
she
says
by
god
exclaimed
maheu
furious
at
being
dragged
out
of
his
dejection
what
is
all
this
clatter
again
have
we
got
enough
to
do
with
our
misery
just
leave
me
alone
damn
you
or
i
let
you
know
it
and
first
who
says
that
my
wife
said
so
who
says
so
pierronne
said
so
maheude
broke
into
a
sharp
laugh
and
turning
towards
the
levaque
woman
an
pierronne
is
it
well
i
can
tell
you
what
she
told
me
yes
she
told
me
that
you
sleep
with
both
your
men
the
one
underneath
and
the
other
on
top
after
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
come
to
an
understanding
they
all
grew
angry
and
the
levaques
as
a
reply
to
the
maheus
asserted
that
pierronne
had
said
a
good
many
other
things
on
their
account
that
they
had
sold
catherine
that
they
were
all
rotten
together
even
to
the
little
ones
with
a
dirty
disease
caught
by
étienne
at
the
volcan
she
said
that
she
said
that
yelled
maheu
good
i
go
to
her
i
will
and
if
she
says
that
she
said
that
she
shall
feel
my
hand
on
her
chops
he
was
carried
out
of
himself
and
the
levaques
followed
him
to
see
what
would
happen
while
bouteloup
having
a
horror
of
disputes
furtively
returned
home
excited
by
the
altercation
maheude
was
also
going
out
when
a
complaint
from
alzire
held
her
back
she
crossed
the
ends
of
the
coverlet
over
the
little
one
quivering
body
and
placed
herself
before
the
window
looking
out
vaguely
and
that
doctor
who
still
delayed
at
the
pierrons
door
maheu
and
the
levaques
met
lydie
who
was
stamping
in
the
snow
the
house
was
closed
and
a
thread
of
light
came
though
a
crack
in
a
shutter
the
child
replied
at
first
to
their
questions
with
constraint
no
her
father
was
not
there
he
had
gone
to
the
washhouse
to
join
mother
brulé
and
bring
back
the
bundle
of
linen
then
she
was
confused
and
would
not
say
what
her
mother
was
doing
at
last
she
let
out
everything
with
a
sly
spiteful
laugh
her
mother
had
pushed
her
out
of
the
door
because
dansaert
was
there
and
she
prevented
them
from
talking
since
the
morning
he
had
been
going
about
the
settlement
with
two
policemen
trying
to
pick
up
workmen
imposing
on
the
weak
and
announcing
everywhere
that
if
the
descent
did
not
take
place
on
monday
at
the
voreux
the
company
had
decided
to
hire
men
from
the
borinage
and
as
the
night
came
on
he
sent
away
the
policemen
finding
pierronne
alone
then
he
had
remained
with
her
to
drink
a
glass
of
gin
before
a
good
fire
hush
hold
your
tongue
we
must
see
them
said
levaque
with
a
lewd
laugh
we
explain
everything
directly
get
off
with
you
youngster
lydie
drew
back
a
few
steps
while
he
put
his
eye
to
a
crack
in
the
shutter
he
stifled
a
low
cry
and
his
back
bent
with
a
quiver
in
her
turn
his
wife
looked
through
but
she
said
as
though
taken
by
the
colic
that
it
was
disgusting
maheu
who
had
pushed
her
wishing
also
to
see
then
declared
that
he
had
had
enough
for
his
money
and
they
began
again
in
a
row
each
taking
his
glance
as
at
a
the
parlour
glittering
with
cleanliness
was
enlivened
by
a
large
fire
there
were
cakes
on
the
table
with
a
bottle
and
glasses
in
fact
quite
a
feast
what
they
saw
going
on
in
there
at
last
exasperated
the
two
men
who
under
other
circumstances
would
have
laughed
over
it
for
six
months
that
she
should
let
herself
be
stuffed
up
to
the
neck
with
her
skirts
in
the
air
was
funny
but
good
god
was
it
not
disgusting
to
do
that
in
front
of
a
great
fire
and
to
get
up
one
strength
with
biscuits
when
the
mates
had
neither
a
slice
of
bread
nor
a
fragment
of
coal
here
father
cried
lydie
running
away
pierron
was
quietly
coming
back
from
the
washhouse
with
the
bundle
of
linen
on
his
shoulder
maheu
immediately
addressed
him
here
they
tell
me
that
your
wife
says
that
i
sold
catherine
and
that
we
are
all
rotten
at
home
and
what
do
they
pay
you
in
your
house
your
wife
and
the
gentleman
who
is
this
minute
wearing
out
her
skin
the
astonished
pierron
could
not
understand
and
pierronne
seized
with
fear
on
hearing
the
tumult
of
voices
lost
her
head
and
set
the
door
ajar
to
see
what
was
the
matter
they
could
see
her
looking
very
red
with
her
dress
open
and
her
skirt
tucked
up
at
her
waist
while
dansaert
in
the
background
was
wildly
buttoning
himself
up
the
head
captain
rushed
away
and
disappeared
trembling
with
fear
that
this
story
would
reach
the
manager
ears
then
there
would
be
an
awful
scandal
laughter
and
hooting
and
abuse
you
who
are
always
saying
that
other
people
are
dirty
shouted
the
levaque
woman
to
pierronne
it
not
surprising
that
you
clean
when
you
get
the
bosses
to
scour
you
ah
it
fine
for
her
to
talk
said
levaque
again
here
a
trollop
who
says
that
my
wife
sleeps
with
me
and
the
lodger
one
below
and
the
other
above
yes
yes
that
what
they
tell
me
you
say
but
pierronne
grown
calm
held
her
own
against
this
abuse
very
contemptuous
in
the
assurance
that
she
was
the
best
looking
and
the
richest
i
said
what
i
said
just
leave
me
alone
will
you
what
have
my
affairs
got
to
do
with
you
a
pack
of
jealous
creatures
who
want
to
get
over
us
because
we
are
able
to
save
up
money
get
along
get
along
you
can
say
what
you
like
my
husband
knows
well
enough
why
monsieur
dansaert
was
here
pierron
in
fact
was
furiously
defending
his
wife
the
quarrel
turned
they
accused
him
of
having
sold
himself
of
being
a
spy
the
dog
they
charged
him
with
shutting
himself
up
to
gorge
himself
with
the
good
things
with
which
the
bosses
paid
him
for
his
treachery
in
defence
he
pretended
that
maheu
had
slipped
beneath
his
door
a
threatening
paper
with
two
and
a
dagger
above
and
this
necessarily
ended
in
a
struggle
between
the
men
as
the
quarrels
of
the
women
always
did
now
that
famine
was
enraging
the
mildest
maheu
and
levaque
rushed
on
pierron
with
their
fists
and
had
to
be
pulled
off
blood
was
flowing
from
her
nose
when
mother
brulé
in
her
turn
arrived
from
the
washhouse
when
informed
of
what
had
been
going
on
she
merely
said
the
damned
beast
dishonours
me
the
road
was
becoming
deserted
not
a
shadow
spotted
the
naked
whiteness
of
the
snow
and
the
settlement
falling
back
into
its
immobility
went
on
starving
beneath
the
intense
cold
and
the
doctor
asked
maheu
as
he
shut
the
door
not
come
replied
maheude
still
standing
before
the
window
are
the
little
ones
back
no
not
back
maheu
again
began
his
heavy
walk
from
one
wall
to
the
other
looking
like
a
stricken
ox
father
bonnemort
seated
stiffly
on
his
chair
had
not
even
lifted
his
head
alzire
also
had
said
nothing
and
was
trying
not
to
shiver
so
as
to
avoid
giving
them
pain
but
in
spite
of
her
courage
in
suffering
she
sometimes
trembled
so
much
that
one
could
hear
against
the
coverlet
the
quivering
of
the
little
invalid
lean
body
while
with
her
large
open
eyes
she
stared
at
the
ceiling
from
which
the
pale
reflection
of
the
white
gardens
lit
up
the
room
like
moonshine
the
emptied
house
was
now
in
its
last
agony
having
reached
a
final
stage
of
nakedness
the
mattress
ticks
had
followed
the
wool
to
the
dealers
then
the
sheets
had
gone
the
linen
everything
that
could
be
sold
one
evening
they
had
sold
a
handkerchief
of
the
grandfather
for
two
sous
tears
fell
over
each
object
of
the
poor
household
which
had
to
go
and
the
mother
was
still
lamenting
that
one
day
she
had
carried
away
in
her
skirt
the
pink
cardboard
box
her
man
old
present
as
one
would
carry
away
a
child
to
get
rid
of
it
on
some
doorstep
they
were
bare
they
had
only
their
skins
left
to
sell
so
and
injured
that
no
one
would
have
given
a
farthing
for
them
they
no
longer
even
took
the
trouble
to
search
they
knew
that
there
was
nothing
left
that
they
had
come
to
the
end
of
everything
that
they
must
not
hope
even
for
a
candle
or
a
fragment
of
coal
or
a
potato
and
they
were
waiting
to
die
only
grieved
about
the
children
and
revolted
by
the
useless
cruelty
that
gave
the
little
one
a
disease
before
starving
it
at
last
here
he
is
said
maheude
a
black
figure
passed
before
the
window
the
door
opened
but
it
was
not
vanderhaghen
they
recognized
the
new
curé
abbé
ranvier
who
did
not
seem
surprised
at
coming
on
this
dead
house
without
light
without
fire
without
bread
he
had
already
been
to
three
neighbouring
houses
going
from
family
to
family
seeking
willing
listeners
like
dansaert
with
his
two
policemen
and
at
once
he
exclaimed
in
his
feverish
fanatic
voice
why
were
you
not
at
mass
on
sunday
my
children
you
are
wrong
the
church
alone
can
save
you
now
promise
me
to
come
next
sunday
maheu
after
staring
at
him
went
on
pacing
heavily
without
a
word
it
was
maheude
who
replied
to
mass
sir
what
for
is
the
good
god
making
fun
of
us
look
here
what
has
my
little
girl
there
done
to
him
to
be
shaking
with
fever
had
we
enough
misery
that
he
had
to
make
her
ill
too
just
when
i
ca
even
give
her
a
cup
of
warm
gruel
then
the
priest
stood
and
talked
at
length
he
spoke
of
the
strike
this
terrible
wretchedness
this
exasperated
rancour
of
famine
with
the
ardour
of
a
missionary
who
is
preaching
to
savages
for
the
glory
of
religion
he
said
that
the
church
was
with
the
poor
that
she
would
one
day
cause
justice
to
triumph
by
calling
down
the
anger
of
god
on
the
iniquities
of
the
rich
and
that
day
would
come
soon
for
the
rich
had
taken
the
place
of
god
and
were
governing
without
god
in
their
impious
theft
of
power
but
if
the
workers
desired
the
fair
division
of
the
goods
of
the
earth
they
ought
at
once
to
put
themselves
in
the
hands
of
the
priests
just
as
on
the
death
of
jesus
the
poor
and
the
humble
grouped
themselves
around
the
apostles
what
strength
the
pope
would
have
what
an
army
the
clergy
would
have
under
them
when
they
were
able
to
command
the
numberless
crowd
of
workers
in
one
week
they
would
purge
the
world
of
the
wicked
they
would
chase
away
the
unworthy
masters
then
indeed
there
would
be
a
real
kingdom
of
god
every
one
recompensed
according
to
his
merits
and
the
law
of
labour
as
the
foundation
for
universal
happiness
maheude
who
was
listening
to
him
seemed
to
hear
étienne
in
those
autumn
evenings
when
he
announced
to
them
the
end
of
their
evils
only
she
had
always
distrusted
the
cloth
that
very
well
what
you
say
there
sir
she
replied
but
because
you
no
longer
agree
with
the
bourgeois
all
our
other
curés
dined
at
the
manager
and
threatened
us
with
the
devil
as
soon
as
we
asked
for
bread
he
began
again
and
spoke
of
the
deplorable
misunderstanding
between
the
church
and
the
people
now
in
veiled
phrases
he
hit
at
the
town
curés
at
the
bishops
at
the
highly
placed
clergy
sated
with
enjoyment
gorged
with
domination
making
pacts
with
the
liberal
middle
class
in
the
imbecility
of
their
blindness
not
seeing
that
it
was
this
middle
class
which
had
dispossessed
them
of
the
empire
of
the
world
deliverance
would
come
from
the
country
priests
who
would
all
rise
to
the
kingdom
of
christ
with
the
help
of
the
poor
and
already
he
seemed
to
be
at
their
head
he
raised
his
bony
form
like
the
chief
of
a
band
a
revolutionary
of
the
gospel
his
eyes
so
filled
with
light
that
they
illuminated
the
gloomy
room
this
enthusiastic
sermon
lifted
him
to
mystic
heights
and
the
poor
people
had
long
ceased
to
understand
him
no
need
for
so
many
words
growled
maheu
suddenly
you
best
begin
by
bringing
us
a
loaf
come
on
sunday
to
mass
cried
the
priest
god
will
provide
for
everything
and
he
went
off
to
catechize
the
levaques
in
their
turn
so
carried
away
by
his
dream
of
the
final
triumph
of
the
church
and
so
contemptuous
of
facts
that
he
would
thus
go
through
the
settlements
without
charities
with
empty
hands
amid
this
army
dying
of
hunger
being
a
poor
devil
himself
who
looked
upon
suffering
as
the
spur
to
salvation
maheu
continued
his
pacing
and
nothing
was
heard
but
his
regular
tramp
which
made
the
floor
tremble
there
was
the
sound
of
a
pulley
old
bonnemort
was
spitting
into
the
cold
grate
then
the
rhythm
of
the
feet
began
again
alzire
weakened
by
fever
was
rambling
in
a
low
voice
laughing
thinking
that
it
was
warm
and
that
she
was
playing
in
the
sun
good
gracious
muttered
maheude
after
having
touched
her
cheeks
how
she
burns
i
do
expect
that
damned
beast
now
the
brigands
must
have
stopped
him
from
coming
she
meant
the
doctor
and
the
company
she
uttered
a
joyous
exclamation
however
when
the
door
once
more
opened
but
her
arms
fell
back
and
she
remained
standing
still
with
gloomy
face
good
evening
whispered
étienne
when
he
had
carefully
closed
the
door
he
often
came
thus
at
the
maheus
learnt
his
retreat
after
the
second
day
but
they
kept
the
secret
and
no
one
in
the
settlement
knew
exactly
what
had
become
of
the
young
man
a
legend
had
grown
up
around
him
people
still
believed
in
him
and
mysterious
rumours
circulated
he
would
reappear
with
an
army
and
chests
full
of
gold
and
there
was
always
the
religious
expectation
of
a
miracle
the
realized
ideal
a
sudden
entry
into
that
city
of
justice
which
he
had
promised
them
some
said
they
had
seen
him
lying
back
in
a
carriage
with
three
other
gentlemen
on
the
marchiennes
road
others
affirmed
that
he
was
in
england
for
a
few
days
at
length
however
suspicions
began
to
arise
and
jokers
accused
him
of
hiding
in
a
cellar
where
mouquette
kept
him
warm
for
this
relationship
when
known
had
done
him
harm
there
was
a
growing
disaffection
in
the
midst
of
his
popularity
a
gradual
increase
of
the
despairing
among
the
faithful
and
their
number
was
certain
little
by
little
to
grow
what
brutal
weather
he
added
and
you
nothing
new
always
from
bad
to
worse
they
tell
me
that
little
négrel
has
been
to
belgium
to
get
borains
good
god
we
are
done
for
if
that
is
true
he
shuddered
as
he
entered
this
dark
icy
room
where
it
was
some
time
before
his
eyes
were
able
to
see
the
unfortunate
people
whose
presence
he
guessed
by
the
deepening
of
the
shade
he
was
experiencing
the
repugnance
and
discomfort
of
the
workman
who
has
risen
above
his
class
refined
by
study
and
stimulated
by
ambition
what
wretchedness
and
odours
and
the
bodies
in
a
heap
and
a
terrible
pity
caught
him
by
the
throat
the
spectacle
of
this
agony
so
overcame
him
that
he
tried
to
find
words
to
advise
submission
but
maheu
came
violently
up
to
him
shouting
borains
they
wo
dare
the
bloody
fools
let
the
borains
go
down
then
if
they
want
us
to
destroy
the
pits
with
an
air
of
constraint
étienne
explained
that
it
was
not
possible
to
move
that
the
soldiers
who
guarded
the
pits
would
protect
the
descent
of
the
belgian
workmen
and
maheu
clenched
his
fists
irritated
especially
as
he
said
by
having
bayonets
in
his
back
then
the
colliers
were
no
longer
masters
in
their
own
place
they
were
treated
then
like
convicts
forced
to
work
by
a
loaded
musket
he
loved
his
pit
it
was
a
great
grief
to
him
not
to
have
been
down
for
two
months
he
was
driven
wild
therefore
at
the
idea
of
this
insult
these
strangers
whom
they
threatened
to
introduce
then
the
recollection
that
his
certificate
had
been
given
back
to
him
struck
him
to
the
heart
i
do
know
why
i
angry
he
muttered
i
do
belong
to
their
shop
any
longer
when
they
have
hunted
me
away
from
here
i
may
as
well
die
on
the
road
as
to
that
said
étienne
if
you
like
they
take
your
certificate
back
people
do
send
away
good
workmen
he
interrupted
himself
surprised
to
hear
alzire
who
was
laughing
softly
in
the
delirium
of
her
fever
so
far
he
had
only
made
out
father
bonnemort
stiff
shadow
and
this
gaiety
of
the
sick
child
frightened
him
it
was
indeed
too
much
if
the
little
ones
were
going
to
die
of
it
with
trembling
voice
he
made
up
his
mind
look
here
this
ca
go
on
we
are
done
for
we
must
give
it
up
maheude
who
had
been
motionless
and
silent
up
to
now
suddenly
broke
out
and
treating
him
familiarly
and
swearing
like
a
man
she
shouted
in
his
face
what
that
you
say
it
you
who
say
that
by
god
he
was
about
to
give
reasons
but
she
would
not
let
him
speak
do
repeat
that
by
god
or
woman
as
i
am
i
put
my
fist
into
your
face
then
we
have
been
dying
for
two
months
and
i
have
sold
my
household
and
my
little
ones
have
fallen
ill
of
it
and
there
is
to
be
nothing
done
and
the
injustice
is
to
begin
again
ah
do
you
know
when
i
think
of
that
my
blood
stands
still
no
no
i
would
burn
everything
i
would
kill
everything
rather
than
give
up
she
pointed
at
maheu
in
the
darkness
with
a
vague
threatening
gesture
listen
to
this
if
any
man
goes
back
to
the
pit
he
find
me
waiting
for
him
on
the
road
to
spit
in
his
face
and
cry
coward
étienne
could
not
see
her
but
he
felt
a
heat
like
the
breath
of
a
barking
animal
he
had
drawn
back
astonished
at
this
fury
which
was
his
work
she
was
so
changed
that
he
could
no
longer
recognize
the
woman
who
was
once
so
sensible
reproving
his
violent
schemes
saying
that
we
ought
not
to
wish
any
one
dead
and
who
was
now
refusing
to
listen
to
reason
and
talking
of
killing
people
it
was
not
he
now
it
was
she
who
talked
politics
who
dreamed
of
sweeping
away
the
bourgeois
at
a
stroke
who
demanded
the
republic
and
the
guillotine
to
free
the
earth
of
these
rich
robbers
who
fattened
on
the
labour
of
starvelings
yes
i
could
flay
them
with
my
fingers
we
had
enough
of
them
our
turn
is
come
now
you
used
to
say
so
yourself
when
i
think
of
the
father
the
grandfather
the
grandfather
father
what
all
of
them
who
went
before
have
suffered
what
we
are
suffering
and
that
our
sons
and
our
sons
sons
will
suffer
it
over
again
it
makes
me
mad
i
could
take
a
knife
the
other
day
we
did
do
enough
at
montsou
we
ought
to
have
pulled
the
bloody
place
to
the
ground
down
to
the
last
brick
and
do
you
know
i
only
one
regret
that
we
did
let
the
old
man
strangle
the
piolaine
girl
hunger
may
strangle
my
little
ones
for
all
they
care
her
words
fell
like
the
blows
of
an
axe
in
the
night
the
closed
horizon
would
not
open
and
the
impossible
ideal
was
turning
to
poison
in
the
depths
of
this
skull
which
had
been
crushed
by
grief
you
have
misunderstood
étienne
was
able
to
say
at
last
beating
a
retreat
we
ought
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
company
i
know
that
the
pits
are
suffering
much
so
that
it
would
probably
consent
to
an
arrangement
no
never
she
shouted
just
then
lénore
and
henri
came
back
with
their
hands
empty
a
gentleman
had
certainly
given
them
two
sous
but
the
girl
kept
kicking
her
little
brother
and
the
two
sous
fell
into
the
snow
and
as
jeanlin
had
joined
in
the
search
they
had
not
been
able
to
find
them
where
is
jeanlin
he
gone
away
mother
he
said
he
had
business
étienne
was
listening
with
an
aching
heart
once
she
had
threatened
to
kill
them
if
they
ever
held
out
their
hands
to
beg
now
she
sent
them
herself
on
to
the
roads
and
proposed
that
all
of
them
the
ten
thousand
colliers
of
montsou
should
take
stick
and
wallet
like
beggars
of
old
and
scour
the
terrified
country
the
anguish
continued
to
increase
in
the
black
room
the
little
urchins
came
back
hungry
they
wanted
to
eat
why
could
they
not
have
something
to
eat
and
they
grumbled
flung
themselves
about
and
at
last
trod
on
the
feet
of
their
dying
sister
who
groaned
the
mother
furiously
boxed
their
ears
in
the
darkness
at
random
then
as
they
cried
still
louder
asking
for
bread
she
burst
into
tears
and
dropped
on
to
the
floor
seizing
them
in
one
embrace
with
the
little
invalid
then
for
a
long
time
her
tears
fell
in
a
nervous
outbreak
which
left
her
limp
and
worn
out
stammering
over
and
over
again
the
same
phrase
calling
for
death
o
god
why
do
you
not
take
us
o
god
in
pity
take
us
to
have
done
with
it
the
grandfather
preserved
his
immobility
like
an
old
tree
twisted
by
the
rain
and
wind
while
the
father
continued
walking
between
the
fireplace
and
the
cupboard
without
turning
his
head
but
the
door
opened
and
this
time
it
was
doctor
vanderhaghen
the
devil
he
said
this
light
wo
spoil
your
eyes
look
sharp
i
in
a
hurry
as
usual
he
scolded
knocked
up
by
work
fortunately
he
had
matches
with
him
and
the
father
had
to
strike
six
one
by
one
and
to
hold
them
while
he
examined
the
invalid
unwound
from
her
coverlet
she
shivered
beneath
this
flickering
light
as
lean
as
a
bird
dying
in
the
snow
so
small
that
one
only
saw
her
hump
but
she
smiled
with
the
wandering
smile
of
the
dying
and
her
eyes
were
very
large
while
her
poor
hands
contracted
over
her
hollow
breast
and
as
the
mother
asked
if
it
was
right
to
take
away
from
her
the
only
child
who
helped
in
the
household
so
intelligent
and
gentle
the
doctor
grew
vexed
ah
she
is
going
dead
of
hunger
your
blessed
child
and
not
the
only
one
either
i
just
seen
another
one
over
there
you
all
send
for
me
but
i
ca
do
anything
it
meat
that
you
want
to
cure
you
maheu
with
burnt
fingers
had
dropped
the
match
and
the
darkness
closed
over
the
little
corpse
which
was
still
warm
the
doctor
had
gone
away
in
a
hurry
étienne
heard
nothing
more
in
the
black
room
but
maheude
sobs
repeating
her
cry
for
death
that
melancholy
and
endless
lamentation
o
god
it
is
my
turn
take
me
o
god
take
my
man
take
the
others
out
of
pity
to
have
done
with
it
chapter
iii
on
that
sunday
ever
since
eight
souvarine
had
been
sitting
alone
in
the
parlour
of
the
avantage
at
his
accustomed
place
with
his
head
against
the
wall
not
a
single
collier
knew
where
to
get
two
sous
for
a
drink
and
never
had
the
bars
had
fewer
customers
so
madame
rasseneur
motionless
at
the
counter
preserved
an
irritated
silence
while
rasseneur
standing
before
the
iron
fireplace
seemed
to
be
gazing
with
a
reflective
air
at
the
brown
smoke
from
the
coal
suddenly
in
this
heavy
silence
of
an
room
three
light
quick
blows
struck
against
one
of
the
made
souvarine
turn
his
head
he
rose
for
he
recognized
the
signal
which
étienne
had
already
used
several
times
before
in
order
to
call
him
when
he
saw
him
from
without
smoking
his
cigarette
at
an
empty
table
but
before
the
could
reach
the
door
rasseneur
had
opened
it
and
recognizing
the
man
who
stood
there
in
the
light
from
the
window
he
said
to
him
are
you
afraid
that
i
shall
sell
you
you
can
talk
better
here
than
on
the
road
étienne
entered
madame
rasseneur
politely
offered
him
a
glass
which
he
refused
with
a
gesture
the
innkeeper
added
i
guessed
long
ago
where
you
hide
yourself
if
i
was
a
spy
as
your
friends
say
i
should
have
sent
the
police
after
you
a
week
ago
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
defend
yourself
replied
the
young
man
i
know
that
you
have
never
eaten
that
sort
of
bread
people
may
have
different
ideas
and
esteem
each
other
all
the
same
and
there
was
silence
once
more
souvarine
had
gone
back
to
his
chair
with
his
back
to
the
wall
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
smoke
from
his
cigarette
but
his
feverish
fingers
were
moving
restlessly
and
he
ran
them
over
his
knees
seeking
the
warm
fur
of
poland
who
was
absent
this
evening
it
was
an
unconscious
discomfort
something
that
was
lacking
he
could
not
exactly
say
what
seated
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
étienne
at
last
said
work
begins
again
at
the
voreux
the
belgians
have
come
with
little
négrel
yes
they
landed
them
at
nightfall
muttered
rasseneur
who
remained
standing
as
long
as
they
do
kill
each
other
after
all
then
raising
his
voice
no
you
know
i
do
want
to
begin
our
disputes
over
again
but
this
will
end
badly
if
you
hold
out
any
longer
why
your
story
is
just
like
that
of
your
international
i
met
pluchart
the
day
before
yesterday
at
lille
where
i
went
on
business
it
going
wrong
that
machine
of
his
he
gave
details
the
association
after
having
conquered
the
workers
of
the
whole
world
in
an
outburst
of
propaganda
which
had
left
the
middle
class
still
shuddering
was
now
being
devoured
and
slowly
destroyed
by
an
internal
struggle
between
vanities
and
ambitions
since
the
anarchists
had
triumphed
in
it
chasing
out
the
earlier
evolutionists
everything
was
breaking
up
the
original
aim
the
reform
of
the
was
lost
in
the
midst
of
the
squabbling
of
sects
the
scientific
framework
was
disorganized
by
the
hatred
of
discipline
and
already
it
was
possible
to
foresee
the
final
miscarriage
of
this
general
revolt
which
for
a
moment
had
threatened
to
carry
away
in
a
breath
the
old
rotten
society
pluchart
is
ill
over
it
rasseneur
went
on
and
he
has
no
voice
at
all
now
all
the
same
he
talks
on
in
spite
of
everything
and
wants
to
go
to
paris
and
he
told
me
three
times
over
that
our
strike
was
done
for
étienne
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
let
him
talk
on
without
interruption
the
evening
before
he
had
chatted
with
some
mates
and
he
felt
that
breaths
of
spite
and
suspicion
were
passing
over
him
those
first
breaths
of
unpopularity
which
forerun
defeat
and
he
remained
gloomy
he
would
not
confess
dejection
in
the
presence
of
a
man
who
had
foretold
to
him
that
the
crowd
would
hoot
him
in
his
turn
on
the
day
when
they
had
to
avenge
themselves
for
a
miscalculation
no
doubt
the
strike
is
done
for
i
know
that
as
well
as
pluchart
he
said
but
we
foresaw
that
we
accepted
this
strike
against
our
wishes
we
did
count
on
finishing
up
with
the
company
only
one
gets
carried
away
one
begins
to
expect
things
and
when
it
turns
out
badly
one
forgets
that
one
ought
to
have
expected
that
instead
of
lamenting
and
quarrelling
as
if
it
were
a
catastrophe
tumbled
down
from
heaven
then
if
you
think
the
game
lost
asked
rasseneur
why
do
you
make
the
mates
listen
to
reason
the
young
man
looked
at
him
fixedly
listen
enough
of
this
you
have
your
ideas
i
have
mine
i
came
in
here
to
show
you
that
i
feel
esteem
for
you
in
spite
of
everything
but
i
still
think
that
if
we
come
to
grief
over
this
trouble
our
starved
carcasses
will
do
more
for
the
people
cause
than
all
your
politics
ah
if
one
of
those
bloody
soldiers
would
just
put
a
bullet
in
my
heart
that
would
be
a
fine
way
of
ending
his
eyes
were
moist
as
in
this
cry
there
broke
out
the
secret
desire
of
the
vanquished
the
refuge
in
which
he
desired
to
lose
his
torment
for
ever
well
said
declared
madame
rasseneur
casting
on
her
husband
a
look
which
was
full
of
all
the
contempt
of
her
radical
opinions
souvarine
with
a
vague
gaze
feeling
about
with
his
nervous
hands
did
not
appear
to
hear
his
fair
girlish
face
with
the
thin
nose
and
small
pointed
teeth
seemed
to
be
growing
savage
in
some
mystic
dream
full
of
bloody
visions
and
he
began
to
dream
aloud
replying
to
a
remark
of
rasseneur
about
the
international
which
had
been
let
fall
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
they
are
all
cowards
there
is
only
one
man
who
can
make
their
machine
into
a
terrible
instrument
of
destruction
it
requires
will
and
none
of
them
have
will
and
that
why
the
revolution
will
miscarry
once
more
he
went
on
in
a
voice
of
disgust
lamenting
the
imbecility
of
men
while
the
other
two
were
disturbed
by
these
somnambulistic
confidences
made
in
the
darkness
in
russia
there
was
nothing
going
on
well
and
he
was
in
despair
over
the
news
he
had
received
his
old
companions
were
all
turning
to
the
politicians
the
famous
nihilists
who
made
europe
tremble
sons
of
village
priests
of
the
lower
middle
class
of
tradesmen
could
not
rise
above
the
idea
of
national
liberation
and
seemed
to
believe
that
the
world
would
be
delivered
when
they
had
killed
their
despot
as
soon
as
he
spoke
to
them
of
razing
society
to
the
ground
like
a
ripe
harvest
as
soon
as
he
even
pronounced
the
infantile
word
republic
he
felt
that
he
was
misunderstood
and
a
disturber
henceforth
unclassed
enrolled
among
the
lost
leaders
of
cosmopolitan
revolution
his
patriotic
heart
struggled
however
and
it
was
with
painful
bitterness
that
he
repeated
his
favourite
expression
foolery
they
never
get
out
of
it
with
their
foolery
then
lowering
his
voice
still
more
in
a
few
bitter
words
he
described
his
old
dream
of
fraternity
he
had
renounced
his
rank
and
his
fortune
he
had
gone
among
workmen
only
in
the
hope
of
seeing
at
last
the
foundation
of
a
new
society
of
labour
in
common
all
the
sous
in
his
pockets
had
long
gone
to
the
urchins
of
the
settlement
he
had
been
as
tender
as
a
brother
with
the
colliers
smiling
at
their
suspicion
winning
them
over
by
his
quiet
workmanlike
ways
and
his
dislike
of
chattering
but
decidedly
the
fusion
had
not
taken
place
he
remained
a
stranger
with
his
contempt
of
all
bonds
his
desire
to
keep
himself
free
of
all
petty
vanities
and
enjoyments
and
since
this
morning
he
had
been
especially
exasperated
by
reading
an
incident
in
the
newspapers
his
voice
changed
his
eyes
grew
bright
he
fixed
them
on
étienne
directly
addressing
him
now
do
you
understand
that
these
hatworkers
at
marseilles
who
have
won
the
great
lottery
prize
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
have
gone
off
at
once
and
invested
it
declaring
that
they
are
going
to
live
without
doing
anything
yes
that
is
your
idea
all
of
you
french
workmen
you
want
to
unearth
a
treasure
in
order
to
devour
it
alone
afterwards
in
some
lazy
selfish
corner
you
may
cry
out
as
much
as
you
like
against
the
rich
you
have
got
courage
enough
to
give
back
to
the
poor
the
money
that
luck
brings
you
you
will
never
be
worthy
of
happiness
as
long
as
you
own
anything
and
your
hatred
of
the
bourgeois
proceeds
solely
from
an
angry
desire
to
be
bourgeois
yourselves
in
their
place
rasseneur
burst
out
laughing
the
idea
that
the
two
marseilles
workmen
ought
to
renounce
the
big
prize
seemed
to
him
absurd
but
souvarine
grew
pale
his
face
changed
and
became
terrible
in
one
of
those
religious
rages
which
exterminate
nations
he
cried
you
will
all
be
mown
down
overthrown
cast
on
the
someone
will
be
born
who
will
annihilate
your
race
of
cowards
and
and
look
here
you
see
my
hands
if
my
hands
were
able
they
would
take
up
the
earth
like
that
and
shake
it
until
it
was
smashed
to
fragments
and
you
were
all
buried
beneath
the
rubbish
well
said
declared
madame
rasseneur
with
her
polite
and
convinced
air
there
was
silence
again
then
étienne
spoke
once
more
of
the
borinage
men
he
questioned
souvarine
concerning
the
steps
that
had
been
taken
at
the
voreux
but
the
was
still
preoccupied
and
scarcely
replied
he
only
knew
that
cartridges
would
be
distributed
to
the
soldiers
who
were
guarding
the
pit
and
the
nervous
restlessness
of
his
fingers
over
his
knees
increased
to
such
an
extent
that
at
last
he
became
conscious
of
what
was
lacking
the
soft
and
soothing
fur
of
the
tame
rabbit
where
is
poland
then
he
asked
the
innkeeper
laughed
again
as
he
looked
at
his
wife
after
an
awkward
silence
he
made
up
his
mind
poland
she
is
in
the
pot
since
her
adventure
with
jeanlin
the
pregnant
rabbit
no
doubt
wounded
had
only
brought
forth
dead
young
ones
and
to
avoid
feeding
a
useless
mouth
they
had
resigned
themselves
that
very
day
to
serve
her
up
with
potatoes
yes
you
ate
one
of
her
legs
this
evening
eh
you
licked
your
fingers
after
it
souvarine
had
not
understood
at
first
then
he
became
very
pale
and
his
face
contracted
with
nausea
while
in
spite
of
his
stoicism
two
large
tears
were
swelling
beneath
his
eyelids
but
no
one
had
time
to
notice
this
emotion
for
the
door
had
opened
roughly
and
chaval
had
appeared
pushing
catherine
before
him
after
having
made
himself
drunk
with
beer
and
bluster
in
all
the
of
montsou
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
to
go
to
the
avantage
to
show
his
old
friends
that
he
was
not
afraid
as
he
came
in
he
said
to
his
mistress
by
god
i
tell
you
you
shall
drink
a
glass
in
here
i
break
the
jaws
of
the
first
man
who
looks
askance
at
me
catherine
moved
at
the
sight
of
étienne
had
become
very
pale
when
chaval
in
his
turn
perceived
him
he
grinned
in
his
evil
fashion
two
glasses
madame
rasseneur
we
wetting
the
new
start
of
work
without
a
word
she
poured
out
as
a
woman
who
never
refused
her
beer
to
any
one
there
was
silence
and
neither
the
landlord
nor
the
two
others
stirred
from
their
places
i
know
people
who
said
that
i
was
a
spy
chaval
went
on
swaggeringly
and
i
waiting
for
them
just
to
say
it
again
to
my
face
so
that
we
can
have
a
bit
of
explanation
no
one
replied
and
the
men
turned
their
heads
and
gazed
vaguely
at
the
walls
there
are
some
who
sham
and
there
are
some
who
do
sham
he
went
on
louder
i
nothing
to
hide
i
left
deneulin
dirty
shop
and
i
going
down
to
the
voreux
with
a
dozen
belgians
who
have
been
given
me
to
lead
because
i
held
in
esteem
and
if
any
one
does
like
that
he
can
just
say
so
and
we
talk
it
over
then
as
the
same
contemptuous
silence
greeted
his
provocations
he
turned
furiously
on
catherine
will
you
drink
by
god
drink
with
me
to
the
confusion
of
all
the
dirty
beasts
who
refuse
to
work
she
drank
but
with
so
trembling
a
hand
that
the
two
glasses
struck
together
with
a
tinkling
sound
he
had
now
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
handful
of
silver
which
he
exhibited
with
drunken
ostentation
saying
that
he
had
earned
that
with
his
sweat
and
that
he
defied
the
shammers
to
show
ten
sous
the
attitude
of
his
mates
exasperated
him
and
he
began
to
come
to
direct
insults
then
it
is
at
night
that
the
moles
come
out
the
police
have
to
go
to
sleep
before
we
meet
the
brigands
étienne
had
risen
very
calm
and
resolute
listen
you
annoy
me
yes
you
are
a
spy
your
money
still
stinks
of
some
treachery
you
sold
yourself
and
it
disgusts
me
to
touch
your
skin
no
matter
i
your
man
it
is
quite
time
that
one
of
us
did
for
the
other
chaval
clenched
his
fists
come
along
then
cowardly
dog
i
must
call
you
so
to
warm
you
up
you
all
alone
i
quite
willing
and
you
shall
pay
for
all
the
bloody
tricks
that
have
been
played
on
me
with
suppliant
arms
catherine
advanced
between
them
but
they
had
no
need
to
repel
her
she
felt
the
necessity
of
the
battle
and
slowly
drew
back
of
her
own
accord
standing
against
the
wall
she
remained
silent
so
paralysed
with
anguish
that
she
no
longer
shivered
her
large
eyes
gazing
at
these
two
men
who
were
going
to
kill
each
other
over
her
madame
rasseneur
simply
removed
the
glasses
from
the
counter
for
fear
that
they
might
be
broken
then
she
sat
down
again
on
the
bench
without
showing
any
improper
curiosity
but
two
old
mates
could
not
be
left
to
murder
each
other
like
this
rasseneur
persisted
in
interfering
and
souvarine
had
to
take
him
by
the
shoulder
and
lead
him
back
to
the
table
saying
it
does
concern
you
there
is
one
of
them
too
many
and
the
strongest
must
live
without
waiting
for
the
attack
chaval
fists
were
already
dealing
blows
at
space
he
was
the
taller
of
the
two
and
his
blows
swung
about
aiming
at
the
face
with
furious
cutting
movements
of
both
arms
one
after
the
other
as
though
he
were
handling
a
couple
of
sabres
and
he
went
on
talking
playing
to
the
gallery
with
volleys
of
abuse
which
served
to
excite
him
ah
you
damned
devil
i
have
your
nose
i
do
for
your
bloody
nose
just
let
me
get
at
your
chops
you
whore
i
make
a
hash
for
the
bloody
swine
and
then
we
shall
see
if
the
strumpets
will
run
after
you
in
silence
and
with
clenched
teeth
étienne
gathered
up
his
small
figure
according
to
the
rules
of
the
game
protecting
his
chest
and
face
by
both
fists
and
he
watched
and
let
them
fly
like
springs
released
with
terrible
straight
blows
at
first
they
did
each
other
little
damage
the
whirling
and
blustering
blows
of
the
one
the
cool
watchfulness
of
the
other
prolonged
the
struggle
a
chair
was
overthrown
their
heavy
boots
crushed
the
white
sand
scattered
on
the
floor
but
at
last
they
were
out
of
breath
their
panting
respiration
was
heard
while
their
faces
became
red
and
swollen
as
from
an
interior
fire
which
flamed
out
from
the
clear
holes
of
their
eyes
played
yelled
chaval
trumps
on
your
carcass
in
fact
his
fist
working
like
a
flail
had
struck
his
shoulder
étienne
restrained
a
groan
of
pain
and
the
only
sound
that
was
heard
was
the
dull
bruising
of
the
muscles
étienne
replied
with
a
straight
blow
to
chaval
chest
which
would
have
knocked
him
out
had
he
had
not
saved
himself
by
one
of
his
constant
leaps
the
blow
however
caught
him
on
the
left
flank
with
such
effect
that
he
tottered
momentarily
winded
he
became
furious
on
feeling
his
arm
grow
limp
with
pain
and
kicked
out
like
a
wild
beast
aiming
at
his
adversary
belly
with
his
heel
have
at
your
guts
he
stammered
in
a
choked
voice
i
pull
them
out
and
unwind
them
for
you
étienne
avoided
the
blow
so
indignant
at
this
infraction
of
the
laws
of
fair
fighting
that
he
broke
silence
hold
your
tongue
brute
and
no
feet
by
god
or
i
take
a
chair
and
bash
you
with
it
then
the
struggle
became
serious
rasseneur
was
disgusted
and
would
again
have
interfered
but
a
severe
look
from
his
wife
held
him
back
had
not
two
customers
a
right
to
settle
an
affair
in
the
house
he
simply
placed
himself
before
the
fireplace
for
fear
lest
they
should
tumble
over
into
it
souvarine
in
his
quiet
way
had
rolled
a
cigarette
but
he
forgot
to
light
it
catherine
was
motionless
against
the
wall
only
her
hands
had
unconsciously
risen
to
her
waist
and
with
constant
fidgeting
movements
were
twisting
and
tearing
at
the
stuff
of
her
dress
she
was
striving
as
hard
as
possible
not
to
cry
out
and
so
perhaps
kill
one
of
them
by
declaring
her
preference
but
she
was
too
so
distracted
that
she
did
not
even
know
which
she
preferred
chaval
who
was
bathed
in
sweat
and
striking
at
random
soon
became
exhausted
in
spite
of
his
anger
étienne
continued
to
cover
himself
parrying
nearly
all
the
blows
a
few
of
which
grazed
him
his
ear
was
split
a
finger
nail
had
torn
away
a
piece
of
his
neck
and
this
so
smarted
that
he
swore
in
his
turn
as
he
drove
out
one
of
his
terrible
straight
blows
once
more
chaval
saved
his
chest
by
a
leap
but
he
had
lowered
himself
and
the
fist
reached
his
face
smashing
his
nose
and
crushing
one
eye
immediately
a
jet
of
blood
came
from
his
nostrils
and
his
eye
became
swollen
and
bluish
blinded
by
this
red
flood
and
dazed
by
the
shock
to
his
skull
the
wretch
was
beating
the
air
with
his
arms
at
random
when
another
blow
striking
him
at
last
full
in
the
chest
finished
him
there
was
a
crunching
sound
he
fell
on
his
back
with
a
heavy
thud
as
when
a
sack
of
plaster
is
emptied
étienne
waited
get
up
if
you
want
some
more
we
begin
again
without
replying
chaval
after
a
few
minutes
stupefaction
moved
on
the
ground
and
stretched
his
limbs
he
picked
himself
up
with
difficulty
resting
for
a
moment
curled
up
on
his
knees
doing
something
with
his
hand
in
the
bottom
of
his
pocket
which
could
not
be
observed
then
when
he
was
up
he
rushed
forward
again
his
throat
swelling
with
a
savage
yell
but
catherine
had
seen
and
in
spite
of
herself
a
loud
cry
came
from
her
heart
astonishing
her
like
the
avowal
of
a
preference
she
had
herself
been
ignorant
of
take
care
he
got
his
knife
étienne
had
only
time
to
parry
the
first
blow
with
his
arm
his
woollen
jacket
was
cut
by
the
thick
blade
one
of
those
blades
fastened
by
a
copper
ferrule
into
a
boxwood
handle
he
had
already
seized
wrist
and
a
terrible
struggle
began
for
he
felt
that
he
would
be
lost
if
he
let
go
while
the
other
shook
his
arm
in
the
effort
to
free
it
and
strike
the
weapon
was
gradually
lowered
as
their
stiffened
limbs
grew
fatigued
étienne
twice
felt
the
cold
sensation
of
the
steel
against
his
skin
and
he
had
to
make
a
supreme
effort
so
crushing
the
other
wrist
that
the
knife
slipped
from
his
hand
both
of
them
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
it
was
étienne
who
snatched
it
up
brandishing
it
in
his
turn
he
held
chaval
down
beneath
his
knee
and
threatened
to
slit
his
throat
open
ah
traitor
by
god
you
got
it
coming
to
you
now
he
felt
an
awful
voice
within
deafening
him
it
arose
from
his
bowels
and
was
beating
in
his
head
like
a
hammer
a
sudden
mania
of
murder
a
need
to
taste
blood
never
before
had
the
crisis
so
shaken
him
he
was
not
drunk
however
and
he
struggled
against
the
hereditary
disease
with
the
despairing
shudder
of
a
man
who
is
mad
with
lust
and
struggles
on
the
verge
of
rape
at
last
he
conquered
himself
he
threw
the
knife
behind
him
stammering
in
a
hoarse
voice
get
up
off
you
go
this
time
rasseneur
had
rushed
forward
but
without
quite
daring
to
venture
between
them
for
fear
of
catching
a
nasty
blow
he
did
not
want
any
one
to
be
murdered
in
his
house
and
was
so
angry
that
his
wife
sitting
erect
at
the
counter
remarked
to
him
that
he
always
cried
out
too
soon
souvarine
who
had
nearly
caught
the
knife
in
his
legs
decided
to
light
his
cigarette
was
it
then
all
over
catherine
was
looking
on
stupidly
at
the
two
men
who
were
unexpectedly
both
living
off
you
go
repeated
étienne
off
you
go
or
i
do
for
you
chaval
arose
and
with
the
back
of
his
hand
wiped
away
the
blood
which
continued
to
flow
from
his
nose
with
jaw
smeared
red
and
bruised
eye
he
went
away
trailing
his
feet
furious
at
his
defeat
catherine
mechanically
followed
him
then
he
turned
round
and
his
hatred
broke
out
in
a
flood
of
filth
no
no
since
you
want
him
sleep
with
him
dirty
jade
and
do
put
your
bloody
feet
in
my
place
again
if
you
value
your
skin
he
violently
banged
the
door
there
was
deep
silence
in
the
warm
room
the
low
crackling
of
the
coal
was
alone
heard
on
the
ground
there
only
remained
the
overturned
chair
and
a
rain
of
blood
which
the
sand
on
the
floor
was
drinking
up
chapter
iv
when
they
came
out
of
rasseneur
étienne
and
catherine
walked
on
in
silence
the
thaw
was
beginning
a
slow
cold
thaw
which
stained
the
snow
without
melting
it
in
the
livid
sky
a
full
moon
could
be
faintly
seen
behind
great
clouds
black
rags
driven
furiously
by
a
tempestuous
wind
far
above
and
on
the
earth
no
breath
was
stirring
nothing
could
be
heard
but
drippings
from
the
roofs
the
falling
of
white
lumps
with
a
soft
thud
étienne
was
embarrassed
by
this
woman
who
had
been
given
to
him
and
in
his
disquiet
he
could
find
nothing
to
say
the
idea
of
taking
her
with
him
to
hide
at
réquillart
seemed
absurd
he
had
proposed
to
lead
her
back
to
the
settlement
to
her
parents
house
but
she
had
refused
in
terror
no
no
anything
rather
than
be
a
burden
on
them
once
more
after
having
behaved
so
badly
to
them
and
neither
of
them
spoke
any
more
they
tramped
on
at
random
through
the
roads
which
were
becoming
rivers
of
mud
at
first
they
went
down
towards
the
voreux
then
they
turned
to
the
right
and
passed
between
the
and
the
canal
but
you
have
to
sleep
somewhere
he
said
at
last
now
if
i
only
had
a
room
i
could
easily
take
you
but
a
curious
spasm
of
timidity
interrupted
him
the
past
came
back
to
him
their
old
longings
for
each
other
and
the
delicacies
and
the
shames
which
had
prevented
them
from
coming
together
did
he
still
desire
her
that
he
felt
so
troubled
gradually
warmed
at
the
heart
by
a
fresh
longing
the
recollection
of
the
blows
she
had
dealt
him
at
now
attracted
him
instead
of
filling
him
with
spite
and
he
was
surprised
the
idea
of
taking
her
to
réquillart
was
becoming
quite
natural
and
easy
to
execute
now
come
decide
where
would
you
like
me
to
take
you
you
must
hate
me
very
much
to
refuse
to
come
with
me
she
was
following
him
slowly
delayed
by
the
painful
slipping
of
her
sabots
into
the
ruts
and
without
raising
her
head
she
murmured
i
have
enough
trouble
good
god
do
give
me
any
more
what
good
would
it
do
us
what
you
ask
now
that
i
have
a
lover
and
you
have
a
woman
yourself
she
meant
mouquette
she
believed
that
he
still
went
with
this
girl
as
the
rumour
ran
for
the
last
fortnight
and
when
he
swore
to
her
that
it
was
not
so
she
shook
her
head
for
she
remembered
the
evening
when
she
had
seen
them
eagerly
kissing
each
other
is
it
a
pity
all
this
nonsense
he
whispered
stopping
we
might
understand
each
other
so
well
she
shuddered
slightly
and
replied
never
mind
you
nothing
to
be
sorry
for
you
do
lose
much
if
you
knew
what
a
trumpery
thing
i
am
no
bigger
than
two
of
butter
so
ill
made
that
i
shall
never
become
a
woman
sure
enough
and
she
went
on
freely
accusing
herself
as
though
the
long
delay
of
her
puberty
had
been
her
own
fault
in
spite
of
the
man
whom
she
had
had
this
lessened
her
placed
her
among
the
urchins
one
has
some
excuse
at
any
rate
when
one
can
produce
a
child
my
poor
little
one
said
étienne
with
deep
pity
in
a
very
low
voice
they
were
at
the
foot
of
the
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
the
enormous
pile
an
inky
cloud
was
just
then
passing
over
the
moon
they
could
no
longer
even
distinguish
their
faces
their
breaths
were
mingled
their
lips
were
seeking
each
other
for
that
kiss
which
had
tormented
them
with
desire
for
months
but
suddenly
the
moon
reappeared
and
they
saw
the
sentinel
above
them
at
the
top
of
the
rocks
white
with
light
standing
out
erect
on
the
voreux
and
before
they
had
kissed
an
emotion
of
modesty
separated
them
that
old
modesty
in
which
there
was
something
of
anger
a
vague
repugnance
and
much
friendship
they
set
out
again
heavily
up
to
their
ankles
in
mud
then
it
settled
you
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
asked
étienne
no
she
said
you
after
chaval
and
after
you
another
eh
no
that
disgusts
me
it
does
give
me
any
pleasure
what
the
use
of
doing
it
they
were
silent
and
walked
some
hundred
paces
without
exchanging
a
word
but
anyhow
do
you
know
where
to
go
to
he
said
again
i
leave
you
out
in
a
night
like
this
she
replied
simply
i
going
back
chaval
is
my
man
i
have
nowhere
else
to
sleep
but
with
him
but
he
will
beat
you
to
death
there
was
silence
again
she
had
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
resignation
he
would
beat
her
and
when
he
was
tired
of
beating
her
he
would
stop
was
not
that
better
than
to
roam
the
streets
like
a
vagabond
then
she
was
used
to
blows
she
said
to
console
herself
that
eight
out
of
ten
girls
were
no
better
off
than
she
was
if
her
lover
married
her
some
day
it
would
all
the
same
be
very
nice
of
him
étienne
and
catherine
were
moving
mechanically
towards
montsou
and
as
they
came
nearer
their
silences
grew
longer
it
was
as
though
they
had
never
before
been
together
he
could
find
no
argument
to
convince
her
in
spite
of
the
deep
vexation
which
he
felt
at
seeing
her
go
back
to
chaval
his
heart
was
breaking
he
had
nothing
better
to
offer
than
an
existence
of
wretchedness
and
flight
a
night
with
no
should
a
soldier
bullet
go
through
his
head
perhaps
after
all
it
was
wiser
to
suffer
what
he
was
suffering
rather
than
risk
a
fresh
suffering
so
he
led
her
back
to
her
lover
with
sunken
head
and
made
no
protest
when
she
stopped
him
on
the
main
road
at
the
corner
of
the
yards
twenty
metres
from
the
estaminet
piquette
saying
do
come
any
farther
if
he
sees
you
it
will
only
make
things
worse
eleven
struck
at
the
church
the
estaminet
was
closed
but
gleams
came
through
the
cracks
she
murmured
she
had
given
him
her
hand
he
kept
it
and
she
had
to
draw
it
away
painfully
with
a
slow
effort
to
leave
him
without
turning
her
head
she
went
in
through
the
little
latched
door
but
he
did
not
turn
away
standing
at
the
same
place
with
his
eyes
on
the
house
anxious
as
to
what
was
passing
within
he
listened
trembling
lest
he
should
hear
the
cries
of
a
beaten
woman
the
house
remained
black
and
silent
he
only
saw
a
light
appear
at
a
window
and
as
this
window
opened
and
he
recognized
the
thin
shadow
that
was
leaning
over
the
road
he
came
near
catherine
then
whispered
very
low
he
not
come
back
i
going
to
bed
please
go
away
étienne
went
off
the
thaw
was
increasing
a
regular
shower
was
falling
from
the
roofs
a
moist
sweat
flowed
down
the
walls
the
palings
the
whole
confused
mass
of
this
industrial
district
lost
in
night
at
first
he
turned
towards
réquillart
sick
with
fatigue
and
sadness
having
no
other
desire
except
to
disappear
under
the
earth
and
to
be
annihilated
there
then
the
idea
of
the
voreux
occurred
to
him
again
he
thought
of
the
belgian
workmen
who
were
going
down
of
his
mates
at
the
settlement
exasperated
against
the
soldiers
and
resolved
not
to
tolerate
strangers
in
their
pit
and
he
passed
again
along
the
canal
through
the
puddles
of
melted
snow
as
he
stood
once
more
near
the
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
he
raised
his
eyes
and
gazed
at
the
sky
the
clouds
were
galloping
by
whipped
on
by
the
strong
wind
which
was
blowing
up
there
but
they
were
growing
white
and
ravelling
out
thinly
with
the
misty
transparency
of
troubled
water
over
the
moon
face
they
succeeded
each
other
so
rapidly
that
the
moon
veiled
at
moments
constantly
reappeared
in
limpid
clearness
with
gaze
full
of
this
pure
brightness
étienne
was
lowering
his
head
when
a
spectacle
on
the
summit
of
the
attracted
his
attention
the
sentinel
stiffened
by
cold
was
walking
up
and
down
taking
paces
towards
marchiennes
and
then
returning
towards
montsou
the
white
glitter
of
his
bayonet
could
be
seen
above
his
black
silhouette
which
stood
out
clearly
against
the
pale
sky
but
what
interested
the
young
man
behind
the
cabin
where
bonnemort
used
to
take
shelter
on
tempestuous
nights
was
a
moving
shadow
a
crouching
beast
in
ambush
which
he
immediately
recognized
as
jeanlin
with
his
long
flexible
spine
like
a
marten
the
sentinel
could
not
see
him
that
brigand
of
a
child
was
certainly
preparing
some
practical
joke
for
he
was
still
furious
against
the
soldiers
and
asking
when
they
were
going
to
be
freed
from
these
murderers
who
had
been
sent
here
with
guns
to
kill
people
for
a
moment
étienne
thought
of
calling
him
to
prevent
the
execution
of
some
stupid
trick
the
moon
was
hidden
he
had
seen
him
draw
himself
up
ready
to
spring
but
the
moon
reappeared
and
the
child
remained
crouching
at
every
turn
the
sentinel
came
as
far
as
the
cabin
then
turned
his
back
and
walked
in
the
opposite
direction
and
suddenly
as
a
cloud
threw
its
shadow
jeanlin
leapt
on
to
the
soldier
shoulders
with
the
great
bound
of
a
wild
cat
and
gripping
him
with
his
claws
buried
his
large
open
knife
in
his
throat
the
collar
resisted
he
had
to
apply
both
hands
to
the
handle
and
hang
on
with
all
the
weight
of
his
body
he
had
often
bled
fowls
which
he
had
found
behind
farms
it
was
so
rapid
that
there
was
only
a
stifled
cry
in
the
night
while
the
musket
fell
with
the
sound
of
old
iron
already
the
moon
was
shining
again
motionless
with
stupor
étienne
was
still
gazing
a
shout
had
been
choked
in
his
chest
above
the
was
vacant
no
shadow
was
any
longer
visible
against
the
wild
flight
of
clouds
he
ran
up
and
found
jeanlin
on
all
fours
before
the
corpse
which
was
lying
back
with
extended
arms
beneath
the
limpid
light
the
red
trousers
and
grey
overcoat
contrasted
harshly
with
the
snow
not
a
drop
of
blood
had
flowed
the
knife
was
still
in
the
throat
up
to
the
handle
with
a
furious
unreasoning
blow
of
the
fist
he
knocked
the
child
down
beside
the
body
what
have
you
done
that
for
he
stammered
wildly
jeanlin
picked
himself
up
and
rested
on
his
hands
with
a
feline
movement
of
his
thin
spine
his
large
ears
his
green
eyes
his
prominent
jaws
were
quivering
and
aflame
with
the
shock
of
his
deadly
blow
by
god
why
have
you
done
this
i
do
know
i
wanted
to
he
persisted
in
this
reply
for
three
days
he
had
wanted
to
it
tormented
him
it
made
his
head
ache
behind
his
ears
because
he
thought
about
it
so
much
need
one
be
so
particular
with
these
damned
soldiers
who
were
worrying
the
colliers
in
their
own
homes
of
the
violent
speeches
he
had
heard
in
the
forest
the
cries
of
destruction
and
death
shouted
among
the
pits
five
or
six
words
had
remained
with
him
and
these
he
repeated
like
a
street
urchin
playing
at
revolution
and
he
knew
no
more
no
one
had
urged
him
on
it
had
come
to
him
of
itself
just
as
the
desire
to
steal
onions
from
a
field
came
to
him
startled
at
this
obscure
growth
of
crime
in
the
recesses
of
this
childish
brain
étienne
again
pushed
him
away
with
a
kick
like
an
unconscious
animal
he
trembled
lest
the
guard
at
the
voreux
had
heard
the
sentinel
stifled
cry
and
looked
towards
the
pit
every
time
the
moon
was
uncovered
but
nothing
stirred
and
he
bent
down
felt
the
hands
that
were
gradually
becoming
icy
and
listened
to
the
heart
which
had
stopped
beneath
the
overcoat
only
the
bone
handle
of
the
knife
could
be
seen
with
the
motto
on
it
the
simple
word
amour
engraved
in
black
letters
his
eyes
went
from
the
throat
to
the
face
suddenly
he
recognized
the
little
soldier
it
was
jules
the
recruit
with
whom
he
had
talked
one
morning
and
deep
pity
came
over
him
in
front
of
this
fair
gentle
face
marked
with
freckles
the
blue
eyes
wide
open
were
gazing
at
the
sky
with
that
fixed
gaze
with
which
he
had
before
seen
him
searching
the
horizon
for
the
country
of
his
birth
where
was
it
that
plogof
which
had
appeared
to
him
beneath
the
dazzling
sun
over
there
over
there
the
sea
was
moaning
afar
on
this
tempestuous
night
that
wind
passing
above
had
perhaps
swept
over
the
moors
two
women
perhaps
were
standing
there
the
mother
and
the
sister
clutching
their
coifs
gazing
as
if
they
could
see
what
was
now
happening
to
the
little
fellow
through
the
leagues
which
separated
them
they
would
always
wait
for
him
now
what
an
abominable
thing
it
is
for
poor
devils
to
kill
each
other
for
the
sake
of
the
rich
but
this
corpse
had
to
be
disposed
of
étienne
at
first
thought
of
throwing
it
into
the
canal
but
was
deterred
from
this
by
the
certainty
that
it
would
be
found
there
his
anxiety
became
extreme
every
minute
was
of
importance
what
decision
should
he
take
he
had
a
sudden
inspiration
if
he
could
carry
the
body
as
far
as
réquillart
he
would
be
able
to
bury
it
there
for
ever
come
here
he
said
to
jeanlin
the
child
was
suspicious
no
you
want
to
beat
me
and
then
i
have
business
good
night
in
fact
he
had
given
a
rendezvous
to
bébert
and
lydie
in
a
a
hole
arranged
under
the
wood
supply
at
the
voreux
it
had
been
arranged
to
sleep
out
so
as
to
be
there
if
the
bones
were
to
be
broken
by
stoning
when
they
went
down
the
pit
listen
repeated
étienne
come
here
or
i
shall
call
the
soldiers
who
will
cut
your
head
off
and
as
jeanlin
was
making
up
his
mind
he
rolled
his
handkerchief
and
bound
the
soldier
neck
tightly
without
drawing
out
the
knife
so
as
to
prevent
the
blood
from
flowing
the
snow
was
melting
on
the
soil
there
was
neither
a
red
patch
nor
the
footmarks
of
a
struggle
take
the
legs
jeanlin
took
the
legs
while
étienne
seized
the
shoulders
after
having
fastened
the
gun
behind
his
back
and
then
they
both
slowly
descended
the
trying
to
avoid
rolling
any
rocks
down
fortunately
the
moon
was
hidden
but
as
they
passed
along
the
canal
it
reappeared
brightly
and
it
was
a
miracle
that
the
guard
did
not
see
them
silently
they
hastened
on
hindered
by
the
swinging
of
the
corpse
and
obliged
to
place
it
on
the
ground
every
hundred
metres
at
the
corner
of
the
réquillart
lane
they
heard
a
sound
which
froze
them
with
terror
and
they
only
had
time
to
hide
behind
a
wall
to
avoid
a
patrol
farther
on
a
man
came
across
them
but
he
was
drunk
and
moved
away
abusing
them
at
last
they
reached
the
old
pit
bathed
in
perspiration
and
so
exhausted
that
their
teeth
were
chattering
étienne
had
guessed
that
it
would
not
be
easy
to
get
the
soldier
down
the
ladder
shaft
it
was
an
awful
task
first
of
all
jeanlin
standing
above
had
to
let
the
body
slide
down
while
étienne
hanging
on
to
the
bushes
had
to
accompany
it
to
enable
it
to
pass
the
first
two
ladders
where
the
rungs
were
broken
afterwards
at
every
ladder
he
had
to
perform
the
same
manoeuvre
over
again
going
down
first
then
receiving
the
body
in
his
arms
and
he
had
thus
down
thirty
ladders
two
hundred
and
ten
metres
to
feel
it
constantly
falling
over
him
the
gun
scraped
his
spine
he
had
not
allowed
the
child
to
go
for
the
which
he
preserved
avariciously
what
was
the
use
the
light
would
only
embarrass
them
in
this
narrow
tube
when
they
arrived
at
the
however
out
of
breath
he
sent
the
youngster
for
the
candle
he
then
sat
down
and
waited
for
him
in
the
darkness
near
the
body
with
heart
beating
violently
as
soon
as
jeanlin
reappeared
with
the
light
étienne
consulted
with
him
for
the
child
had
explored
these
old
workings
even
to
the
cracks
through
which
men
could
not
pass
they
set
out
again
dragging
the
dead
body
for
nearly
a
kilometre
through
a
maze
of
ruinous
galleries
at
last
the
roof
became
low
and
they
found
themselves
kneeling
beneath
a
sandy
rock
supported
by
planks
it
was
a
sort
of
long
chest
in
which
they
laid
the
little
soldier
as
in
a
coffin
they
placed
his
gun
by
his
side
then
with
vigorous
blows
of
their
heels
they
broke
the
timber
at
the
risk
of
being
buried
themselves
immediately
the
rock
gave
way
and
they
scarcely
had
time
to
crawl
back
on
their
elbows
and
knees
when
étienne
returned
seized
by
the
desire
to
look
once
more
the
roof
was
still
falling
in
slowly
crushing
the
body
beneath
its
enormous
weight
and
then
there
was
nothing
more
left
nothing
but
the
vast
mass
of
the
earth
jeanlin
having
returned
to
his
own
corner
his
little
cavern
of
villainy
was
stretching
himself
out
on
the
hay
overcome
by
weariness
and
murmuring
heigho
the
brats
must
wait
for
me
i
going
to
have
an
hour
sleep
étienne
had
blown
out
the
candle
of
which
there
was
only
a
small
end
left
he
also
was
worn
out
but
he
was
not
sleepy
painful
nightmare
thoughts
were
beating
like
hammers
in
his
skull
only
one
at
last
remained
torturing
him
and
fatiguing
him
with
a
question
to
which
he
could
not
reply
why
had
he
not
struck
chaval
when
he
held
him
beneath
the
knife
and
why
had
this
child
just
killed
a
soldier
whose
very
name
he
did
not
know
it
shook
his
revolutionary
beliefs
the
courage
to
kill
the
right
to
kill
was
he
then
a
coward
in
the
hay
the
child
had
begun
snoring
the
snoring
of
a
drunken
man
as
if
he
were
sleeping
off
the
intoxication
of
his
murder
étienne
was
disgusted
and
irritated
it
hurt
him
to
know
that
the
boy
was
there
and
to
hear
him
suddenly
he
started
a
breath
of
fear
passed
over
his
face
a
light
rustling
a
sob
seemed
to
him
to
have
come
out
of
the
depths
of
the
earth
the
image
of
the
little
soldier
lying
over
there
with
his
gun
beneath
the
rocks
froze
his
back
and
made
his
hair
stand
up
it
was
idiotic
the
whole
mine
seemed
to
be
filled
with
voices
he
had
to
light
the
candle
again
and
only
grew
calm
on
seeing
the
emptiness
of
the
galleries
by
this
pale
light
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
he
reflected
still
absorbed
in
the
same
struggle
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
burning
wick
but
there
was
a
spluttering
the
wick
was
going
out
and
everything
fell
back
into
darkness
he
shuddered
again
he
could
have
boxed
jeanlin
ears
to
keep
him
from
snoring
so
loudly
the
neighbourhood
of
the
child
became
so
unbearable
that
he
escaped
tormented
by
the
need
for
fresh
air
hastening
through
the
galleries
and
up
the
passage
as
though
he
could
hear
a
shadow
panting
at
his
heels
up
above
in
the
midst
of
the
ruins
of
réquillart
étienne
was
at
last
able
to
breathe
freely
since
he
dared
not
kill
it
was
for
him
to
die
and
this
idea
of
death
which
had
already
touched
him
came
again
and
fixed
itself
in
his
head
as
a
last
hope
to
die
bravely
to
die
for
the
revolution
that
would
end
everything
would
settle
his
account
good
or
bad
and
prevent
him
from
thinking
more
if
the
men
attacked
the
borains
he
would
be
in
the
first
rank
and
would
have
a
good
chance
of
getting
a
bad
blow
it
was
with
firmer
step
that
he
returned
to
prowl
around
the
voreux
two
struck
and
the
loud
noise
of
voices
was
coming
from
the
captains
room
where
the
guards
who
watched
over
the
pit
were
posted
the
disappearance
of
the
sentinel
had
overcome
the
guards
with
surprise
they
had
gone
to
arouse
the
captain
and
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
place
they
concluded
that
it
must
be
a
case
of
desertion
hiding
in
the
shade
étienne
recollected
this
republican
captain
of
whom
the
little
soldier
had
spoken
who
knows
if
he
might
not
be
persuaded
to
pass
over
to
the
people
side
the
troop
would
raise
their
rifles
and
that
would
be
the
signal
for
a
massacre
of
the
bourgeois
a
new
dream
took
possession
of
him
he
thought
no
more
of
dying
but
remained
for
hours
with
his
feet
in
the
mud
and
a
drizzle
from
the
thaw
falling
on
his
shoulders
filled
by
the
feverish
hope
that
victory
was
still
possible
up
to
five
he
watched
for
the
borains
then
he
perceived
that
the
company
had
cunningly
arranged
that
they
should
sleep
at
the
voreux
the
descent
had
begun
and
the
few
strikers
from
the
settlement
who
had
been
posted
as
scouts
had
not
yet
warned
their
mates
it
was
he
who
told
them
of
the
trick
and
they
set
out
running
while
he
waited
behind
the
on
the
six
struck
and
the
earthy
sky
was
growing
pale
and
lighting
up
with
a
reddish
dawn
when
the
abbé
ranvier
came
along
a
path
holding
up
his
cassock
above
his
thin
legs
every
monday
he
went
to
say
an
early
mass
at
a
convent
chapel
on
the
other
side
of
the
pit
good
morning
my
friend
he
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
after
staring
at
the
young
man
with
his
flaming
eyes
but
étienne
did
not
reply
far
away
between
the
voreux
platforms
he
had
just
seen
a
woman
pass
and
he
rushed
forward
anxiously
for
he
thought
he
recognized
catherine
since
midnight
catherine
had
been
walking
about
the
thawing
roads
chaval
on
coming
back
and
finding
her
in
bed
had
knocked
her
out
with
a
blow
he
shouted
to
her
to
go
at
once
by
the
door
if
she
did
not
wish
to
go
by
the
window
and
scarcely
dressed
in
tears
and
bruised
by
kicks
in
her
legs
she
had
been
obliged
to
go
down
pushed
outside
by
a
final
thrust
this
sudden
separation
dazed
her
and
she
sat
down
on
a
stone
looking
up
at
the
house
still
expecting
that
he
would
call
her
back
it
was
not
possible
he
would
surely
look
for
her
and
tell
her
to
come
back
when
he
saw
her
thus
shivering
and
abandoned
with
no
one
to
take
her
in
at
the
end
of
two
hours
she
made
up
her
mind
dying
of
cold
and
as
motionless
as
a
dog
thrown
into
the
street
she
left
montsou
then
retraced
her
steps
but
dared
neither
to
call
from
the
pathway
nor
to
knock
at
the
door
at
last
she
went
off
by
the
main
road
to
the
right
with
the
idea
of
going
to
the
settlement
to
her
parents
house
but
when
she
reached
it
she
was
seized
by
such
shame
that
she
rushed
away
along
the
gardens
for
fear
of
being
recognized
by
someone
in
spite
of
the
heavy
sleep
which
weighed
on
all
eyes
behind
the
closed
shutters
and
after
that
she
wandered
about
frightened
at
the
slightest
noise
trembling
lest
she
should
be
seized
and
led
away
as
a
strumpet
to
that
house
at
marchiennes
the
threat
of
which
had
haunted
her
like
nightmare
for
months
twice
she
stumbled
against
the
voreux
but
terrified
at
the
loud
voices
of
the
guard
she
ran
away
out
of
breath
looking
behind
her
to
see
if
she
was
being
pursued
the
réquillart
lane
was
always
full
of
drunken
men
she
went
back
to
it
however
with
the
vague
hope
of
meeting
there
him
she
had
repelled
a
few
hours
earlier
chaval
had
to
go
down
that
morning
and
this
thought
brought
catherine
again
towards
the
pit
though
she
felt
that
it
would
be
useless
to
speak
to
him
all
was
over
between
them
there
was
no
work
going
on
at
and
he
had
sworn
to
kill
her
if
she
worked
again
at
the
voreux
where
he
feared
that
she
would
compromise
him
so
what
was
to
be
done
to
go
elsewhere
to
die
of
hunger
to
yield
beneath
the
blows
of
every
man
who
might
pass
she
dragged
herself
along
tottering
amid
the
ruts
with
aching
legs
and
mud
up
to
her
spine
the
thaw
had
now
filled
the
streets
with
a
flood
of
mire
she
waded
through
it
still
walking
not
daring
to
look
for
a
stone
to
sit
on
day
appeared
catherine
had
just
recognized
the
back
of
chaval
who
was
cautiously
going
round
the
when
she
noticed
lydie
and
bébert
putting
their
noses
out
of
their
beneath
the
wood
supply
they
had
passed
the
night
there
in
ambush
without
going
home
since
jeanlin
order
was
to
await
him
and
while
this
latter
was
sleeping
off
the
drunkenness
of
his
murder
at
réquillart
the
two
children
were
lying
in
each
other
arms
to
keep
warm
the
wind
blew
between
the
planks
of
chestnut
and
oak
and
they
rolled
themselves
up
as
in
some
abandoned
hut
lydie
did
not
dare
to
speak
aloud
the
sufferings
of
a
small
beaten
woman
any
more
than
bébert
found
courage
to
complain
of
the
captain
blows
which
made
his
cheeks
swell
but
the
captain
was
really
abusing
his
power
risking
their
bones
in
mad
marauding
expeditions
while
refusing
to
share
the
booty
their
hearts
rose
in
revolt
and
they
had
at
last
embraced
each
other
in
spite
of
his
orders
careless
of
that
box
of
the
ears
from
the
invisible
with
which
he
had
threatened
them
it
never
came
so
they
went
on
kissing
each
other
softly
with
no
idea
of
anything
else
putting
into
that
caress
the
passion
they
had
long
struggled
against
the
whole
of
their
martyred
and
tender
natures
all
night
through
they
had
thus
kept
each
other
warm
so
happy
at
the
bottom
of
this
secret
hole
that
they
could
not
remember
that
they
had
ever
been
so
happy
before
not
even
on
barbara
day
when
they
had
eaten
fritters
and
drunk
wine
the
sudden
sound
of
a
bugle
made
catherine
start
she
raised
herself
and
saw
the
voreux
guards
taking
up
their
arms
étienne
arrived
running
bébert
and
lydie
jumped
out
of
their
with
a
leap
and
over
there
beneath
the
growing
daylight
a
band
of
men
and
women
were
coming
from
the
settlement
gesticulating
wildly
with
anger
chapter
v
all
the
entrances
to
the
voreux
had
been
closed
and
the
sixty
soldiers
with
grounded
arms
were
barring
the
only
door
left
free
that
leading
to
the
by
a
narrow
staircase
into
which
opened
the
captains
room
and
the
shed
the
men
had
been
drawn
up
in
two
lines
against
the
brick
wall
so
that
they
could
not
be
attacked
from
behind
at
first
the
band
of
miners
from
the
settlement
kept
at
a
distance
they
were
some
thirty
at
most
and
talked
together
in
a
violent
and
confused
way
maheude
who
had
arrived
first
with
dishevelled
hair
beneath
a
handkerchief
knotted
on
in
haste
and
having
estelle
asleep
in
her
arms
repeated
in
feverish
tones
do
let
any
one
in
or
any
one
out
shut
them
all
in
there
maheu
approved
and
just
then
father
mouque
arrived
from
réquillart
they
wanted
to
prevent
him
from
passing
but
he
protested
he
said
that
his
horses
ate
their
hay
all
the
same
and
cared
precious
little
about
a
revolution
besides
there
was
a
horse
dead
and
they
were
waiting
for
him
to
draw
it
up
étienne
freed
the
old
groom
and
the
soldiers
allowed
him
to
go
to
the
shaft
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
as
the
band
of
strikers
which
had
gradually
enlarged
was
becoming
threatening
a
large
door
opened
on
the
ground
floor
and
some
men
appeared
drawing
out
the
dead
beast
a
miserable
mass
of
flesh
still
fastened
in
the
rope
net
they
left
it
in
the
midst
of
the
puddles
of
melting
snow
the
surprise
was
so
great
that
no
one
prevented
the
men
from
returning
and
barricading
the
door
afresh
they
all
recognized
the
horse
with
his
head
bent
back
and
stiff
against
the
plank
whispers
ran
around
it
trompette
is
it
it
trompette
it
was
in
fact
trompette
since
his
descent
he
had
never
become
acclimatized
he
remained
melancholy
with
no
taste
for
his
task
as
though
tortured
by
regret
for
the
light
in
vain
bataille
the
of
the
mine
would
rub
him
with
his
ribs
in
his
friendly
way
softly
biting
his
neck
to
impart
to
him
a
little
of
the
resignation
gained
in
his
ten
years
beneath
the
earth
these
caresses
increased
his
melancholy
his
skin
quivered
beneath
the
confidences
of
the
comrade
who
had
grown
old
in
darkness
and
both
of
them
whenever
they
met
and
snorted
together
seemed
to
be
grieving
the
old
one
that
he
could
no
longer
remember
the
young
one
that
he
could
not
forget
at
the
stable
they
were
neighbours
at
the
manger
and
lived
with
lowered
heads
breathing
in
each
other
nostrils
exchanging
a
constant
dream
of
daylight
visions
of
green
grass
of
white
roads
of
infinite
yellow
light
then
when
trompette
bathed
in
sweat
lay
in
agony
in
his
litter
bataille
had
smelled
at
him
despairingly
with
short
sniffs
like
sobs
he
felt
that
he
was
growing
cold
the
mine
was
taking
from
him
his
last
joy
that
friend
fallen
from
above
fresh
with
good
odours
who
recalled
to
him
his
youth
in
the
open
air
and
he
had
broken
his
tether
neighing
with
fear
when
he
perceived
that
the
other
no
longer
stirred
mouque
had
indeed
warned
the
head
captain
a
week
ago
but
much
they
troubled
about
a
sick
horse
at
such
time
as
this
these
gentlemen
did
not
at
all
like
moving
the
horses
now
however
they
had
to
make
up
their
minds
to
take
him
out
the
evening
before
the
groom
had
spent
an
hour
with
two
men
tying
up
trompette
they
harnessed
bataille
to
bring
him
to
the
shaft
the
old
horse
slowly
pulled
dragging
his
dead
comrade
through
so
narrow
a
gallery
that
he
could
only
shake
himself
at
the
risk
of
taking
the
skin
off
and
he
tossed
his
head
listening
to
the
grazing
sound
of
the
carcass
as
it
went
to
the
knacker
yard
at
the
when
he
was
unharnessed
he
followed
with
his
melancholy
eye
the
preparations
for
the
ascent
the
body
pushed
on
to
the
over
the
sump
the
net
fastened
beneath
a
cage
at
last
the
porters
rang
meat
he
lifted
his
neck
to
see
it
go
up
at
first
softly
then
at
once
lost
in
the
darkness
flown
up
for
ever
to
the
top
of
that
black
hole
and
he
remained
with
neck
stretched
out
his
vague
memory
perhaps
recalling
the
things
of
the
earth
but
it
was
all
over
he
would
never
see
his
comrade
again
and
he
himself
would
thus
be
tied
up
in
a
pitiful
bundle
on
the
day
when
he
would
ascend
up
there
his
legs
began
to
tremble
the
fresh
air
which
came
from
the
distant
country
choked
him
and
he
seemed
intoxicated
when
he
went
heavily
back
to
the
stable
at
the
surface
the
colliers
stood
gloomily
before
trompette
carcass
a
woman
said
in
a
low
voice
another
man
that
may
go
down
if
it
likes
but
a
new
flood
arrived
from
the
settlement
and
levaque
who
was
at
the
head
followed
by
his
wife
and
bouteloup
shouted
kill
them
those
borains
no
blacklegs
here
kill
them
kill
them
all
rushed
forward
and
étienne
had
to
stop
them
he
went
up
to
the
captain
a
tall
thin
young
man
of
scarcely
years
with
a
despairing
resolute
face
he
explained
things
to
him
he
tried
to
win
him
over
watching
the
effect
of
his
words
what
was
the
good
of
risking
a
useless
massacre
was
not
justice
on
the
side
of
the
miners
they
were
all
brothers
and
they
ought
to
understand
one
another
when
he
came
to
use
the
world
republic
the
captain
made
a
nervous
movement
but
he
preserved
his
military
stiffness
and
said
suddenly
keep
off
do
not
force
me
to
do
my
duty
three
times
over
étienne
tried
again
behind
him
his
mates
were
growling
the
report
ran
that
hennebeau
was
at
the
pit
and
they
talked
of
letting
him
down
by
the
neck
to
see
if
he
would
hew
his
coal
himself
but
it
was
a
false
report
only
négrel
and
dansaert
were
there
they
both
showed
themselves
for
a
moment
at
a
window
of
the
the
head
captain
stood
in
the
background
rather
out
of
countenance
since
his
adventure
with
pierronne
while
the
engineer
bravely
looked
round
on
the
crowd
with
his
bright
little
eyes
smiling
with
that
sneering
contempt
in
which
he
enveloped
men
and
things
generally
hooting
arose
and
they
disappeared
and
in
their
place
only
souvarine
pale
face
was
seen
he
was
just
then
on
duty
he
had
not
left
his
engine
for
a
single
day
since
the
strike
began
no
longer
talking
more
and
more
absorbed
by
a
fixed
idea
which
seemed
to
be
shining
like
steel
in
the
depths
of
his
pale
eyes
keep
off
repeated
the
captain
loudly
i
wish
to
hear
nothing
my
orders
are
to
guard
the
pit
and
i
shall
guard
it
and
do
not
press
on
to
my
men
or
i
shall
know
how
to
drive
you
back
in
spite
of
his
firm
voice
he
was
growing
pale
with
increasing
anxiety
as
the
flood
of
miners
continued
to
swell
he
would
be
relieved
at
midday
but
fearing
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
hold
out
until
then
he
had
sent
a
trammer
from
the
pit
to
montsou
to
ask
for
reinforcements
shouts
had
replied
to
him
kill
the
blacklegs
kill
the
borains
we
mean
to
be
masters
in
our
own
place
étienne
drew
back
in
despair
the
end
had
come
there
was
nothing
more
except
to
fight
and
to
die
and
he
ceased
to
hold
back
his
mates
the
mob
moved
up
to
the
little
troop
there
were
nearly
four
hundred
of
them
and
the
people
from
the
neighbouring
settlements
were
all
running
up
they
all
shouted
the
same
cry
maheu
and
levaque
said
furiously
to
the
soldiers
get
off
with
you
we
have
nothing
against
you
get
off
with
you
this
does
concern
you
said
maheude
let
us
attend
to
our
own
affairs
and
from
behind
the
levaque
woman
added
more
violently
must
we
eat
you
to
get
through
just
clear
out
of
the
bloody
place
even
lydie
shrill
voice
was
heard
she
had
crammed
herself
in
more
closely
with
bébert
and
was
saying
in
a
high
voice
oh
the
pigs
catherine
a
few
paces
off
was
gazing
and
listening
stupefied
by
new
scenes
of
violence
into
the
midst
of
which
ill
luck
seemed
to
be
always
throwing
her
had
she
not
suffered
too
much
already
what
fault
had
she
committed
then
that
misfortune
would
never
give
her
any
rest
the
day
before
she
had
understood
nothing
of
the
fury
of
the
strike
she
thought
that
when
one
has
one
share
of
blows
it
is
useless
to
go
and
seek
for
more
and
now
her
heart
was
swelling
with
hatred
she
remembered
what
étienne
had
often
told
her
when
they
used
to
sit
up
she
tried
to
hear
what
he
was
now
saying
to
the
soldiers
he
was
treating
them
as
mates
he
reminded
them
that
they
also
belonged
to
the
people
and
that
they
ought
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
people
against
those
who
took
advantage
of
their
wretchedness
but
a
tremor
ran
through
the
crowd
and
an
old
woman
rushed
up
it
was
mother
brulé
terrible
in
her
leanness
with
her
neck
and
arms
in
the
air
coming
up
at
such
a
pace
that
the
wisps
of
her
grey
hair
blinded
her
ah
by
god
here
i
am
she
stammered
out
of
breath
that
traitor
pierron
who
shut
me
up
in
the
cellar
and
without
waiting
she
fell
on
the
soldiers
her
black
mouth
belching
abuse
pack
of
scoundrels
dirty
scum
ready
to
lick
their
masters
boots
and
only
brave
against
poor
people
then
the
others
joined
her
and
there
were
volleys
of
insults
a
few
indeed
cried
hurrah
for
the
soldiers
to
the
shaft
with
the
officer
but
soon
there
was
only
one
clamour
down
with
the
red
breeches
these
men
who
had
listened
quietly
with
motionless
mute
faces
to
the
fraternal
appeals
and
the
friendly
attempts
to
win
them
over
preserved
the
same
stiff
passivity
beneath
this
hail
of
abuse
behind
them
the
captain
had
drawn
his
sword
and
as
the
crowd
pressed
in
on
them
more
and
more
threatening
to
crush
them
against
the
wall
he
ordered
them
to
present
bayonets
they
obeyed
and
a
double
row
of
steel
points
was
placed
in
front
of
the
strikers
breasts
ah
the
bloody
swine
yelled
mother
brulé
drawing
back
but
already
they
were
coming
on
again
in
excited
contempt
of
death
the
women
were
throwing
themselves
forward
maheude
and
the
levaque
shouting
kill
us
kill
us
then
we
want
our
rights
levaque
at
the
risk
of
getting
cut
had
seized
three
bayonets
in
his
hands
shaking
and
pulling
them
in
the
effort
to
snatch
them
away
he
twisted
them
in
the
strength
of
his
fury
while
bouteloup
standing
aside
and
annoyed
at
having
followed
his
mate
quietly
watched
him
just
come
and
look
here
said
maheu
just
look
a
bit
if
you
are
good
chaps
and
he
opened
his
jacket
and
drew
aside
his
shirt
showing
his
naked
breast
with
his
hairy
skin
tattooed
by
coal
he
pressed
on
the
bayonets
compelling
the
soldiers
to
draw
back
terrible
in
his
insolence
and
bravado
one
of
them
had
pricked
him
in
the
chest
and
he
became
like
a
madman
trying
to
make
it
enter
deeper
and
to
hear
his
ribs
crack
cowards
you
do
dare
there
are
ten
thousand
behind
us
yes
you
can
kill
us
there
are
ten
thousand
more
of
us
to
kill
yet
the
position
of
the
soldiers
was
becoming
critical
for
they
had
received
strict
orders
not
to
make
use
of
their
weapons
until
the
last
extremity
and
how
were
they
to
prevent
these
furious
people
from
impaling
themselves
besides
the
space
was
getting
less
they
were
now
pushed
back
against
the
wall
and
it
was
impossible
to
draw
further
back
their
little
troop
a
mere
handful
of
men
opposed
to
the
rising
flood
of
miners
still
held
its
own
however
and
calmly
executed
the
brief
orders
given
by
the
captain
the
latter
with
keen
eyes
and
nervously
compressed
lips
only
feared
lest
they
should
be
carried
away
by
this
abuse
already
a
young
sergeant
a
tall
lean
fellow
whose
thin
moustache
was
bristling
up
was
blinking
his
eyes
in
a
disquieting
manner
near
him
an
old
soldier
with
tanned
skin
and
stripes
won
in
twenty
campaigns
had
grown
pale
when
he
saw
his
bayonet
twisted
like
a
straw
another
doubtless
a
recruit
still
smelling
the
fields
became
very
red
every
time
he
heard
himself
called
scum
and
and
the
violence
did
not
cease
the
outstretched
fists
the
abominable
words
the
shovelfuls
of
accusations
and
threats
which
buffeted
their
faces
it
required
all
the
force
of
order
to
keep
them
thus
with
mute
faces
in
the
proud
gloomy
silence
of
military
discipline
a
collision
seemed
inevitable
when
captain
richomme
appeared
from
behind
the
troop
with
his
benevolent
white
head
overwhelmed
by
emotion
he
spoke
out
loudly
by
god
this
is
idiotic
such
tomfoolery
ca
go
on
and
he
threw
himself
between
the
bayonets
and
the
miners
mates
listen
to
me
you
know
that
i
am
an
old
workman
and
that
i
have
always
been
one
of
you
well
by
god
i
promise
you
that
if
they
not
just
with
you
i
the
man
to
go
and
say
to
the
bosses
how
things
lie
but
this
is
too
much
it
does
no
good
at
all
to
howl
bad
names
at
these
good
fellows
and
try
and
get
your
bellies
ripped
up
they
listened
hesitating
but
up
above
unfortunately
little
short
profile
reappeared
he
feared
no
doubt
that
he
would
be
accused
of
sending
a
captain
in
place
of
venturing
out
himself
and
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
midst
of
so
frightful
a
tumult
that
he
had
to
leave
the
window
again
simply
shrugging
his
shoulders
richomme
then
found
it
vain
to
entreat
them
in
his
own
name
and
to
repeat
that
the
thing
must
be
arranged
between
mates
they
repelled
him
suspecting
him
but
he
was
obstinate
and
remained
amongst
them
by
god
let
them
break
my
head
as
well
as
yours
for
i
do
leave
you
while
you
are
so
foolish
étienne
whom
he
begged
to
help
him
in
making
them
hear
reason
made
a
gesture
of
powerlessness
it
was
too
late
there
were
now
more
than
five
hundred
of
them
and
besides
the
madmen
who
were
rushing
up
to
chase
away
the
borains
some
came
out
of
inquisitiveness
or
to
joke
and
amuse
themselves
over
the
battle
in
the
midst
of
one
group
at
some
distance
zacharie
and
philoméne
were
looking
on
as
at
a
theatre
so
peacefully
that
they
had
brought
their
two
children
achille
and
désirée
another
stream
was
arriving
from
réquillart
including
mouquet
and
mouquette
the
former
at
once
went
on
grinning
to
slap
his
friend
zacharie
on
the
back
while
mouquette
in
a
very
excited
condition
rushed
to
the
first
rank
of
the
every
minute
however
the
captain
looked
down
the
montsou
road
the
desired
reinforcements
had
not
arrived
and
his
sixty
men
could
hold
out
no
longer
at
last
it
occurred
to
him
to
strike
the
imagination
of
the
crowd
and
he
ordered
his
men
to
load
the
soldiers
executed
the
order
but
the
disturbance
increased
the
blustering
and
the
mockery
ah
these
shammers
they
going
off
to
the
target
jeered
the
women
the
brulé
the
levaque
and
the
others
maheude
with
her
breast
covered
by
the
little
body
of
estelle
who
was
awake
and
crying
came
so
near
that
the
sergeant
asked
her
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
that
poor
little
brat
what
the
devil
that
to
do
with
you
she
replied
fire
at
it
if
you
dare
the
men
shook
their
heads
with
contempt
none
believed
that
they
would
fire
on
them
there
are
no
balls
in
their
cartridges
said
levaque
are
we
cossacks
cried
maheu
you
do
fire
against
frenchmen
by
god
others
said
that
when
people
had
been
through
the
crimean
campaign
they
were
not
afraid
of
lead
and
all
continued
to
thrust
themselves
on
to
the
rifles
if
firing
had
begun
at
this
moment
the
crowd
would
have
been
mown
down
in
the
front
rank
mouquette
was
choking
with
fury
thinking
that
the
soldiers
were
going
to
gash
the
women
skins
she
had
spat
out
all
her
coarse
words
at
them
and
could
find
no
vulgarity
low
enough
when
suddenly
having
nothing
left
but
that
mortal
offence
with
which
to
bombard
the
faces
of
the
troop
she
exhibited
her
backside
with
both
hands
she
raised
her
skirts
bent
her
back
and
expanded
the
enormous
rotundity
here
that
for
you
and
it
a
lot
too
clean
you
dirty
blackguards
she
ducked
and
butted
so
that
each
might
have
his
share
repeating
after
each
thrust
there
for
the
officer
there
for
the
sergeant
there
for
the
soldiers
a
tempest
of
laughter
arose
bébert
and
lydie
were
in
convulsions
étienne
himself
in
spite
of
his
sombre
expectation
applauded
this
insulting
nudity
all
of
them
the
banterers
as
well
as
the
infuriated
were
now
hooting
the
soldiers
as
though
they
had
seen
them
stained
by
a
splash
of
filth
catherine
only
standing
aside
on
some
old
timber
remained
silent
with
the
blood
at
her
heart
slowly
carried
away
by
the
hatred
that
was
rising
within
her
but
a
hustling
took
place
to
calm
the
excitement
of
his
men
the
captain
decided
to
make
prisoners
with
a
leap
mouquette
escaped
saving
herself
between
the
legs
of
her
comrades
three
miners
levaque
and
two
others
were
seized
among
the
more
violent
and
kept
in
sight
at
the
other
end
of
the
captains
room
négrel
and
dansaert
above
were
shouting
to
the
captain
to
come
in
and
take
refuge
with
them
he
refused
he
felt
that
these
buildings
with
their
doors
without
locks
would
be
carried
by
assault
and
that
he
would
undergo
the
shame
of
being
disarmed
his
little
troop
was
already
growling
with
impatience
it
was
impossible
to
flee
before
these
wretches
in
sabots
the
sixty
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
and
their
rifles
loaded
again
faced
the
mob
at
first
there
was
a
recoil
followed
by
deep
silence
the
strikers
were
astonished
at
this
energetic
stroke
then
a
cry
arose
calling
for
the
prisoners
demanding
their
immediate
release
some
voices
said
that
they
were
being
murdered
in
there
and
without
any
attempt
at
concerted
action
carried
away
by
the
same
impulse
by
the
same
desire
for
revenge
they
all
ran
to
the
piles
of
bricks
which
stood
near
those
bricks
for
which
the
marly
soil
supplied
the
clay
and
which
were
baked
on
the
spot
the
children
brought
them
one
by
one
and
the
women
filled
their
skirts
with
them
every
one
soon
had
her
ammunition
at
her
feet
and
the
battle
of
stones
began
it
was
mother
brulé
who
set
to
first
she
broke
the
bricks
on
the
sharp
edge
of
her
knee
and
with
both
hands
she
discharged
the
two
fragments
the
levaque
woman
was
almost
putting
her
shoulders
out
being
so
large
and
soft
that
she
had
to
come
near
to
get
her
aim
in
spite
of
bouteloup
entreaties
and
he
dragged
her
back
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
lead
her
away
now
that
her
husband
had
been
taken
off
they
all
grew
excited
and
mouquette
tired
of
making
herself
bleed
by
breaking
the
bricks
on
her
overfat
thighs
preferred
to
throw
them
whole
even
the
youngsters
came
into
line
and
bébert
showed
lydie
how
the
brick
ought
to
be
sent
from
under
the
elbow
it
was
a
shower
of
enormous
hailstones
producing
low
thuds
and
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
these
furies
catherine
was
observed
with
her
fists
in
the
air
also
brandishing
and
throwing
them
with
all
the
force
of
her
little
arms
she
could
not
have
said
why
she
was
suffocating
she
was
dying
of
the
desire
to
kill
everybody
would
it
not
soon
be
done
with
this
cursed
life
of
misfortune
she
had
had
enough
of
it
beaten
and
driven
away
by
her
man
wandering
about
like
a
lost
dog
in
the
mud
of
the
roads
without
being
able
to
ask
a
crust
from
her
father
who
was
starving
like
herself
things
never
seemed
to
get
better
they
were
getting
worse
ever
since
she
could
remember
and
she
broke
the
bricks
and
threw
them
before
her
with
the
one
idea
of
sweeping
everything
away
her
eyes
so
blinded
that
she
could
not
even
see
whose
jaws
she
might
be
crushing
étienne
who
had
remained
in
front
of
the
soldiers
nearly
had
his
skull
broken
his
ear
was
grazed
and
turning
round
he
started
when
he
realized
that
the
brick
had
come
from
catherine
feverish
hands
but
at
the
risk
of
being
killed
he
remained
where
he
was
gazing
at
her
many
others
also
forgot
themselves
there
absorbed
in
the
battle
with
empty
hands
mouquet
criticized
the
blows
as
though
he
were
looking
on
at
a
game
of
oh
that
was
well
struck
and
that
other
no
luck
he
joked
and
with
his
elbow
pushed
zacharie
who
was
squabbling
with
philoméne
because
he
had
boxed
achille
and
ears
refusing
to
put
them
on
his
back
so
that
they
could
see
there
were
spectators
crowded
all
along
the
road
and
at
the
top
of
the
slope
near
the
entrance
to
the
settlement
old
bonnemort
appeared
resting
on
his
stick
motionless
against
the
sky
as
soon
as
the
first
bricks
were
thrown
captain
richomme
had
again
placed
himself
between
the
soldiers
and
the
miners
he
was
entreating
the
one
party
exhorting
the
other
party
careless
of
danger
in
such
despair
that
large
tears
were
flowing
from
his
eyes
it
was
impossible
to
hear
his
words
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
only
his
large
grey
moustache
could
be
seen
moving
but
the
hail
of
bricks
came
faster
the
men
were
joining
in
following
the
example
of
the
women
then
maheude
noticed
that
maheu
was
standing
behind
with
empty
hands
and
sombre
air
what
up
with
you
she
shouted
are
you
a
coward
are
you
going
to
let
your
mates
be
carried
off
to
prison
ah
if
only
i
had
got
this
child
you
should
see
estelle
who
was
clinging
to
her
neck
screaming
prevented
her
from
joining
mother
brulé
and
the
others
and
as
her
man
did
not
seem
to
hear
she
kicked
some
bricks
against
his
legs
by
god
will
you
take
that
must
i
spit
in
your
face
before
people
to
get
your
spirits
up
becoming
very
red
he
broke
some
bricks
and
threw
them
she
lashed
him
on
dazing
him
shouting
behind
him
cries
of
death
stifling
her
daughter
against
her
breast
with
the
spasm
of
her
arms
and
he
still
moved
forward
until
he
was
opposite
the
guns
beneath
this
shower
of
stones
the
little
troop
was
disappearing
fortunately
they
struck
too
high
and
the
wall
was
riddled
what
was
to
be
done
the
idea
of
going
in
of
turning
their
backs
for
a
moment
turned
the
captain
pale
face
purple
but
it
was
no
longer
possible
they
would
be
torn
to
pieces
at
the
least
movement
a
brick
had
just
broken
the
peak
of
his
cap
drops
of
blood
were
running
down
his
forehead
several
of
his
men
were
wounded
and
he
felt
that
they
were
losing
in
that
unbridled
instinct
of
when
obedience
to
leaders
ceases
the
sergeant
had
uttered
a
by
god
for
his
left
shoulder
had
nearly
been
put
out
and
his
flesh
bruised
by
a
shock
like
the
blow
of
a
washerwoman
beetle
against
linen
grazed
twice
over
the
recruit
had
his
thumb
smashed
while
his
right
knee
was
grazed
were
they
to
let
themselves
be
worried
much
longer
a
stone
having
bounded
back
and
struck
the
old
soldier
with
the
stripes
beneath
the
belly
his
cheeks
turned
green
and
his
weapon
trembled
as
he
stretched
it
out
at
the
end
of
his
lean
arms
three
times
the
captain
was
on
the
point
of
ordering
them
to
fire
he
was
choked
by
anguish
an
endless
struggle
for
several
seconds
set
at
odds
in
his
mind
all
ideas
and
duties
all
his
beliefs
as
a
man
and
as
a
soldier
the
rain
of
bricks
increased
and
he
opened
his
mouth
and
was
about
to
shout
fire
when
the
guns
went
off
of
themselves
three
shots
at
first
then
five
then
the
roll
of
a
volley
then
one
by
itself
some
time
afterwards
in
the
deep
silence
there
was
stupefaction
on
all
sides
they
had
fired
and
the
gaping
crowd
stood
motionless
as
yet
unable
to
believe
it
but
cries
arose
while
the
bugle
was
sounding
to
cease
firing
and
here
was
a
mad
panic
the
rush
of
cattle
filled
with
grapeshot
a
wild
flight
through
the
mud
bébert
and
lydie
had
fallen
one
on
top
of
the
other
at
the
first
three
shots
the
little
girl
struck
in
the
face
the
boy
wounded
beneath
the
left
shoulder
she
was
crushed
and
never
stirred
again
but
he
moved
seized
her
with
both
arms
in
the
convulsion
of
his
agony
as
if
he
wanted
to
take
her
again
as
he
had
taken
her
at
the
bottom
of
the
black
where
they
had
spent
the
past
night
and
jeanlin
who
just
then
ran
up
from
réquillart
still
half
asleep
kicking
about
in
the
midst
of
the
smoke
saw
him
embrace
his
little
wife
and
die
the
five
other
shots
had
brought
down
mother
brulé
and
captain
richomme
struck
in
the
back
as
he
was
entreating
his
mates
he
had
fallen
on
to
his
knees
and
slipping
on
to
one
hip
he
was
groaning
on
the
ground
with
eyes
still
full
of
tears
the
old
woman
whose
breast
had
been
opened
had
fallen
back
stiff
and
crackling
like
a
bundle
of
dry
faggots
stammering
one
last
oath
in
the
gurgling
of
blood
but
then
the
volley
swept
the
field
mowing
down
the
inquisitive
groups
who
were
laughing
at
the
battle
a
hundred
paces
off
a
ball
entered
mouquet
mouth
and
threw
him
down
with
fractured
skull
at
the
feet
of
zacharie
and
philoméne
whose
two
youngsters
were
splashed
with
red
drops
at
the
same
moment
mouquette
received
two
balls
in
the
belly
she
had
seen
the
soldiers
take
aim
and
in
an
instinctive
movement
of
her
good
nature
she
had
thrown
herself
in
front
of
catherine
shouting
out
to
her
to
take
care
she
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
fell
on
to
her
back
overturned
by
the
shock
étienne
ran
up
wishing
to
raise
her
and
take
her
away
but
with
a
gesture
she
said
it
was
all
over
then
she
groaned
but
without
ceasing
to
smile
at
both
of
them
as
though
she
were
glad
to
see
them
together
now
that
she
was
going
away
all
seemed
to
be
over
and
the
hurricane
of
balls
was
lost
in
the
distance
as
far
as
the
frontages
of
the
settlement
when
the
last
shot
isolated
and
delayed
was
fired
maheu
struck
in
the
heart
turned
round
and
fell
with
his
face
down
into
a
puddle
black
with
coal
maheude
leant
down
in
stupefaction
eh
old
man
get
up
it
nothing
is
it
her
hands
were
engaged
with
estelle
whom
she
had
to
put
under
one
arm
in
order
to
turn
her
man
head
say
something
where
are
you
hurt
his
eyes
were
vacant
and
his
mouth
was
slavered
with
bloody
foam
she
understood
he
was
dead
then
she
remained
seated
in
the
mud
with
her
daughter
under
her
arm
like
a
bundle
gazing
at
her
old
man
with
a
besotted
air
the
pit
was
free
with
a
nervous
movement
the
captain
had
taken
off
and
then
put
on
his
cap
struck
by
a
stone
he
preserved
his
pallid
stiffness
in
face
of
the
disaster
of
his
life
while
his
men
with
mute
faces
were
reloading
the
frightened
faces
of
négrel
and
dansaert
could
be
seen
at
the
window
of
the
souvarine
was
behind
them
with
a
deep
wrinkle
on
his
forehead
as
though
the
nail
of
his
fixed
idea
had
printed
itself
there
threateningly
on
the
other
side
of
the
horizon
at
the
edge
of
the
plain
bonnemort
had
not
moved
supported
by
one
hand
on
his
stick
the
other
hand
up
to
his
brows
to
see
better
the
murder
of
his
people
below
the
wounded
were
howling
the
dead
were
growing
cold
in
twisted
postures
muddy
with
the
liquid
mud
of
the
thaw
here
and
there
forming
puddles
among
the
inky
patches
of
coal
which
reappeared
beneath
the
tattered
snow
and
in
the
midst
of
these
human
corpses
all
small
poor
and
lean
in
their
wretchedness
lay
trompette
carcass
a
monstrous
and
pitiful
mass
of
dead
flesh
étienne
had
not
been
killed
he
was
still
waiting
beside
catherine
who
had
fallen
from
fatigue
and
anguish
when
a
sonorous
voice
made
him
start
it
was
abbé
ranvier
who
was
coming
back
after
saying
mass
and
who
with
both
arms
in
the
air
with
the
inspired
fury
of
a
prophet
was
calling
the
wrath
of
god
down
on
the
murderers
he
foretold
the
era
of
justice
the
approaching
extermination
of
the
middle
class
by
fire
from
heaven
since
it
was
bringing
its
crimes
to
a
climax
by
massacring
the
workers
and
the
disinherited
of
the
world
part

chapter
i
the
shots
fired
at
montsou
had
reached
as
far
as
paris
with
a
formidable
echo
for
four
days
all
the
opposition
journals
had
been
indignant
displaying
atrocious
narratives
on
their
front
pages

dead
including
three
women
and

become
a
sort
of
hero
and
was
credited
with
a
reply
of
antique
sublimity
to
the
examining
magistrate
the
empire
hit
in
mid
career
by
these
few
balls
affected
the
calm
of
omnipotence
without
itself
realizing
the
gravity
of
its
wound
it
was
simply
an
unfortunate
collision
something
lost
over
there
in
the
black
country
very
far
from
the
parisian
boulevards
which
formed
public
opinion
it
would
soon
be
forgotten
the
company
had
received
official
intimation
to
hush
up
the
affair
and
to
put
an
end
to
a
strike
which
from
its
irritating
duration
was
becoming
a
social
danger
so
on
wednesday
morning
three
of
the
directors
appeared
at
montsou
the
little
town
sick
at
heart
which
had
not
dared
hitherto
to
rejoice
over
the
massacre
now
breathed
again
and
tasted
the
joy
of
being
saved
the
weather
too
had
become
fine
there
was
a
bright
sun
one
of
those
first
february
days
which
with
their
moist
warmth
tip
the
lilac
shoots
with
green
all
the
shutters
had
been
flung
back
at
the
administration
building
the
vast
structure
seemed
alive
again
and
cheering
rumours
were
circulating
it
was
said
that
the
directors
deeply
affected
by
the
catastrophe
had
rushed
down
to
open
their
paternal
arms
to
the
wanderers
from
the
settlements
now
that
the
blow
had
fallen
a
more
vigorous
one
doubtless
than
they
had
wished
for
they
were
prodigal
in
their
task
of
relief
and
decreed
measures
that
were
excellent
though
tardy
first
of
all
they
sent
away
the
borains
and
made
much
of
this
extreme
concession
to
their
workmen
then
they
put
an
end
to
the
military
occupation
of
the
pits
which
were
no
longer
threatened
by
the
crushed
strikers
they
also
obtained
silence
regarding
the
sentinel
who
had
disappeared
from
the
voreux
the
district
had
been
searched
without
finding
either
the
gun
or
the
corpse
and
although
there
was
a
suspicion
of
crime
it
was
decided
to
consider
the
soldier
a
deserter
in
every
way
they
thus
tried
to
attenuate
matters
trembling
with
fear
for
the
morrow
judging
it
dangerous
to
acknowledge
the
irresistible
savagery
of
a
crowd
set
free
amid
the
falling
structure
of
the
old
world
and
besides
this
work
of
conciliation
did
not
prevent
them
from
bringing
purely
administrative
affairs
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
for
deneulin
had
been
seen
to
return
to
the
administration
buildings
where
he
met
hennebeau
the
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
vandame
continued
and
it
was
considered
certain
that
deneulin
would
accept
the
company
offers
but
what
particularly
stirred
the
country
were
the
great
yellow
posters
which
the
directors
had
stuck
up
in
profusion
on
the
walls
on
them
were
to
be
read
these
few
lines
in
very
large
letters
workers
of
montsou
we
do
not
wish
that
the
errors
of
which
you
have
lately
seen
the
sad
effects
should
deprive
sensible
and
willing
workmen
of
their
livelihood
we
shall
therefore
reopen
all
the
pits
on
monday
morning
and
when
work
is
resumed
we
shall
examine
with
care
and
consideration
those
cases
in
which
there
may
be
room
for
improvement
we
shall
in
fact
do
all
that
is
just
or
possible
to
do
in
one
morning
the
ten
thousand
colliers
passed
before
these
placards
not
one
of
them
spoke
many
shook
their
heads
others
went
away
with
trailing
steps
without
changing
one
line
in
their
motionless
faces
up
till
now
the
settlement
of
the
had
persisted
in
its
fierce
resistance
it
seemed
that
the
blood
of
their
mates
which
had
reddened
the
mud
of
the
pit
was
barricading
the
road
against
the
others
scarcely
a
dozen
had
gone
down
merely
pierron
and
some
sneaks
of
his
sort
whose
departure
and
arrival
were
gloomily
watched
without
a
gesture
or
a
threat
therefore
a
deep
suspicion
greeted
the
placard
stuck
on
to
the
church
nothing
was
said
about
the
returned
certificates
in
that
would
the
company
refuse
to
take
them
on
again
and
the
fear
of
retaliations
the
fraternal
idea
of
protesting
against
the
dismissal
of
the
more
compromised
men
made
them
all
obstinate
still
it
was
dubious
they
would
see
they
would
return
to
the
pit
when
these
gentlemen
were
good
enough
to
put
things
plainly
silence
crushed
the
low
houses
hunger
itself
seemed
nothing
all
might
die
now
that
violent
death
had
passed
over
their
roofs
but
one
house
that
of
the
maheus
remained
especially
black
and
mute
in
its
overwhelming
grief
since
she
had
followed
her
man
to
the
cemetery
maheude
kept
her
teeth
clenched
after
the
battle
she
had
allowed
étienne
to
bring
back
catherine
muddy
and
half
dead
and
as
she
was
undressing
her
before
the
young
man
in
order
to
put
her
to
bed
she
thought
for
a
moment
that
her
daughter
also
had
received
a
ball
in
the
belly
for
the
chemise
was
marked
with
large
patches
of
blood
but
she
soon
understood
that
it
was
the
flood
of
puberty
which
was
at
last
breaking
out
in
the
shock
of
this
abominable
day
ah
another
piece
of
luck
that
wound
a
fine
present
to
be
able
to
make
children
for
the
gendarmes
to
kill
and
she
never
spoke
to
catherine
nor
did
she
indeed
talk
to
étienne
the
latter
slept
with
jeanlin
at
the
risk
of
being
arrested
seized
by
such
horror
at
the
idea
of
going
back
to
the
darkness
of
réquillart
that
he
would
have
preferred
a
prison
a
shudder
shook
him
the
horror
of
the
night
after
all
those
deaths
an
unacknowledged
fear
of
the
little
soldier
who
slept
down
there
underneath
the
rocks
besides
he
dreamed
of
a
prison
as
of
a
refuge
in
the
midst
of
the
torment
of
his
defeat
but
they
did
not
trouble
him
and
he
dragged
on
his
wretched
hours
not
knowing
how
to
weary
out
his
body
only
at
times
maheude
looked
at
both
of
them
at
him
and
her
daughter
with
a
spiteful
air
as
though
she
were
asking
them
what
they
were
doing
in
her
house
once
more
they
were
all
snoring
in
a
heap
father
bonnemort
occupied
the
former
bed
of
the
two
youngsters
who
slept
with
catherine
now
that
poor
alzire
no
longer
dug
her
hump
into
her
big
sister
ribs
it
was
when
going
to
bed
that
the
mother
felt
the
emptiness
of
the
house
by
the
coldness
of
her
bed
which
was
now
too
large
in
vain
she
took
estelle
to
fill
the
vacancy
that
did
not
replace
her
man
and
she
wept
quietly
for
hours
then
the
days
began
to
pass
by
as
before
always
without
bread
but
without
the
luck
to
die
outright
things
picked
up
here
and
there
rendered
to
the
wretches
the
poor
service
of
keeping
them
alive
nothing
had
changed
in
their
existence
only
her
man
was
gone
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
étienne
made
miserable
by
the
sight
of
this
silent
woman
left
the
room
and
walked
slowly
along
the
paved
street
of
the
settlement
the
inaction
which
weighed
on
him
impelled
him
to
take
constant
walks
with
arms
swinging
idly
and
lowered
head
always
tortured
by
the
same
thought
he
tramped
thus
for
half
an
hour
when
he
felt
by
an
increase
in
his
discomfort
that
his
mates
were
coming
to
their
doors
to
look
at
him
his
little
remaining
popularity
had
been
driven
to
the
winds
by
that
fusillade
and
he
never
passed
now
without
meeting
fiery
looks
which
pursued
him
when
he
raised
his
head
there
were
threatening
men
there
women
drawing
aside
the
curtains
from
their
windows
and
beneath
this
still
silent
accusation
and
the
restrained
anger
of
these
eyes
enlarged
by
hunger
and
tears
he
became
awkward
and
could
scarcely
walk
straight
these
dumb
reproaches
seemed
to
be
always
increasing
behind
him
he
became
so
terrified
lest
he
should
hear
the
entire
settlement
come
out
to
shout
its
wretchedness
at
him
that
he
returned
shuddering
but
at
the
maheus
the
scene
which
met
him
still
further
agitated
him
old
bonnemort
was
near
the
cold
fireplace
nailed
to
his
chair
ever
since
two
neighbours
on
the
day
of
the
slaughter
had
found
him
on
the
ground
with
his
stick
broken
struck
down
like
an
old
tree
and
while
lénore
and
henri
to
beguile
their
hunger
were
scraping
with
deafening
noise
an
old
saucepan
in
which
cabbages
had
been
boiled
the
day
before
maheude
after
having
placed
estelle
on
the
table
was
standing
up
threatening
catherine
with
her
fist
say
that
again
by
god
just
dare
to
say
that
again
catherine
had
declared
her
intention
to
go
back
to
the
voreux
the
idea
of
not
gaining
her
bread
of
being
thus
tolerated
in
her
house
like
a
useless
animal
that
is
in
the
way
was
becoming
every
day
more
unbearable
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fear
of
chaval
she
would
have
gone
down
on
tuesday
she
said
again
stammering
what
would
you
have
we
ca
go
on
doing
nothing
we
should
get
bread
anyhow
maheude
interrupted
her
listen
to
me
the
first
one
of
you
who
goes
to
work
i
do
for
you
no
that
would
be
too
much
to
kill
the
father
and
go
on
taking
it
out
of
the
children
i
had
enough
of
it
i
rather
see
you
all
put
in
your
coffins
like
him
that
gone
already
and
her
long
silence
broke
out
into
a
furious
flood
of
words
a
fine
sum
catherine
would
bring
her
hardly
thirty
sous
to
which
they
might
add
twenty
sous
if
the
bosses
were
good
enough
to
find
work
for
that
brigand
jeanlin
fifty
sous
and
seven
mouths
to
feed
the
brats
were
only
good
to
swallow
soup
as
to
the
grandfather
he
must
have
broken
something
in
his
brain
when
he
fell
for
he
seemed
imbecile
unless
it
had
turned
his
blood
to
see
the
soldiers
firing
at
his
mates
that
it
old
man
is
it
they
quite
done
for
you
it
no
good
having
your
hands
still
strong
you
done
for
bonnemort
looked
at
her
with
his
dim
eyes
without
understanding
he
remained
for
hours
with
fixed
gaze
having
no
intelligence
now
except
to
spit
into
a
plate
filled
with
ashes
which
was
put
beside
him
for
cleanliness
and
they
not
settled
his
pension
either
she
went
on
and
sure
they
wo
give
it
because
of
our
ideas
no
i
tell
you
that
we
had
too
much
to
do
with
those
people
who
bring
ill
luck
but
catherine
ventured
to
say
they
promise
on
the
placard
just
let
me
alone
with
your
damned
placard
more
birdlime
for
catching
us
and
eating
us
they
can
be
mighty
kind
now
that
they
have
ripped
us
open
but
where
shall
we
go
mother
they
wo
keep
us
at
the
settlement
sure
enough
maheude
made
a
vague
terrified
gesture
where
should
they
go
to
she
did
not
know
at
all
she
avoided
thinking
it
made
her
mad
they
would
go
elsewhere
somewhere
and
as
the
noise
of
the
saucepan
was
becoming
unbearable
she
turned
round
on
lénore
and
henri
and
boxed
their
ears
the
fall
of
estelle
who
had
been
crawling
on
all
fours
increased
the
disturbance
the
mother
quieted
her
with
a
push
a
good
thing
if
it
had
killed
her
she
spoke
of
alzire
she
wished
the
others
might
have
that
child
luck
then
suddenly
she
burst
out
into
loud
sobs
with
her
head
against
the
wall
étienne
who
was
standing
by
did
not
dare
to
interfere
he
no
longer
counted
for
anything
in
the
house
and
even
the
children
drew
back
from
him
suspiciously
but
the
unfortunate
woman
tears
went
to
his
heart
and
he
murmured
come
come
courage
we
must
try
to
get
out
of
it
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
and
was
bemoaning
herself
now
in
a
low
continuous
complaint
ah
the
wretchedness
is
it
possible
things
did
go
on
before
these
horrors
we
ate
our
bread
dry
but
we
were
all
together
and
what
has
happened
good
god
what
have
we
done
then
that
we
should
have
such
troubles
some
under
the
earth
and
the
others
with
nothing
left
but
to
long
to
get
there
too
it
true
enough
that
they
harnessed
us
like
horses
to
work
and
it
not
at
all
a
just
sharing
of
things
to
be
always
getting
the
stick
and
making
rich
people
fortunes
bigger
without
hope
of
ever
tasting
the
good
things
there
no
pleasure
in
life
when
hope
goes
yes
that
could
have
gone
on
longer
we
had
to
breathe
a
bit
if
we
had
only
known
is
it
possible
to
make
oneself
so
wretched
through
wanting
justice
sighs
swelled
her
breast
and
her
voice
choked
with
immense
sadness
then
there
are
always
some
clever
people
there
who
promise
you
that
everything
can
be
arranged
by
just
taking
a
little
trouble
then
one
loses
one
head
and
one
suffers
so
much
from
things
as
they
are
that
one
asks
for
things
that
ca
be
now
i
was
dreaming
like
a
fool
i
seemed
to
see
a
life
of
good
friendship
with
everybody
i
went
off
into
the
air
my
faith
into
the
clouds
and
then
one
breaks
one
back
when
one
tumbles
down
into
the
mud
again
it
not
true
there
nothing
over
there
of
the
things
that
people
tell
of
what
there
is
is
only
wretchedness
ah
wretchedness
as
much
as
you
like
of
it
and
bullets
into
the
bargain
étienne
listened
to
this
lamentation
and
every
tear
struck
him
with
remorse
he
knew
not
what
to
say
to
calm
maheude
broken
by
her
terrible
fall
from
the
heights
of
the
ideal
she
had
come
back
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
was
now
looking
at
him
she
addressed
him
with
contemptuous
familiarity
in
a
last
cry
of
rage
and
you
do
you
talk
of
going
back
to
the
pit
too
after
driving
us
out
of
the
bloody
place
i
nothing
to
reproach
you
with
but
if
i
were
in
your
shoes
i
should
be
dead
of
grief
by
now
after
causing
such
harm
to
the
mates
he
was
about
to
reply
but
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
despair
what
was
the
good
of
explaining
for
she
would
not
understand
in
her
grief
and
he
went
away
for
he
was
suffering
too
much
and
resumed
his
wild
walk
outside
there
again
he
found
the
settlement
apparently
waiting
for
him
the
men
at
the
doors
the
women
at
the
windows
as
soon
as
he
appeared
growls
were
heard
and
the
crowd
increased
the
breath
of
gossip
which
had
been
swelling
for
four
days
was
breaking
out
in
a
universal
malediction
fists
were
stretched
towards
him
mothers
spitefully
pointed
him
out
to
their
boys
old
men
spat
as
they
looked
at
him
it
was
the
change
which
follows
on
the
morrow
of
defeat
the
fatal
reverse
of
popularity
an
execration
exasperated
by
all
the
suffering
endured
without
result
he
had
to
pay
for
famine
and
death
zacharie
who
came
up
with
philoméne
hustled
étienne
as
he
went
out
grinning
maliciously
well
he
gets
fat
it
filling
then
to
live
on
other
deaths
the
levaque
woman
had
already
come
to
her
door
with
bouteloup
she
spoke
of
bébert
her
youngster
killed
by
a
bullet
and
cried
yes
there
are
cowards
who
get
children
murdered
let
him
go
and
look
for
mine
in
the
earth
if
he
wants
to
give
it
me
back
she
was
forgetting
her
man
in
prison
for
the
household
was
going
on
since
bouteloup
remained
but
she
thought
of
him
however
and
went
on
in
a
shrill
voice
get
along
rascals
may
walk
about
while
good
people
are
put
away
in
avoiding
her
étienne
tumbled
on
to
pierronne
who
was
running
up
across
the
gardens
she
had
regarded
her
mother
death
as
a
deliverance
for
the
old
woman
violence
threatened
to
get
them
hanged
nor
did
she
weep
over
pierron
little
girl
that
lydie
a
good
riddance
but
she
joined
in
with
her
neighbours
with
the
idea
of
getting
reconciled
with
them
and
my
mother
eh
and
the
little
girl
you
were
seen
you
were
hiding
yourself
behind
them
when
they
caught
the
lead
instead
of
you
what
was
to
be
done
strangle
pierronne
and
the
others
and
fight
the
whole
settlement
étienne
wanted
to
do
so
for
a
moment
the
blood
was
throbbing
in
his
head
he
now
looked
upon
his
mates
as
brutes
he
was
irritated
to
see
them
so
unintelligent
and
barbarous
that
they
wanted
to
revenge
themselves
on
him
for
the
logic
of
facts
how
stupid
it
all
was
and
he
felt
disgust
at
his
powerlessness
to
tame
them
again
and
satisfied
himself
with
hastening
his
steps
as
though
he
were
deaf
to
abuse
soon
it
became
a
flight
every
house
hooted
him
as
he
passed
they
hastened
on
his
heels
it
was
a
whole
nation
cursing
him
with
a
voice
that
was
becoming
like
thunder
in
its
overwhelming
hatred
it
was
he
the
exploiter
the
murderer
who
was
the
sole
cause
of
their
misfortune
he
rushed
out
of
the
settlement
pale
and
terrified
with
this
yelling
crowd
behind
his
back
when
he
at
last
reached
the
main
road
most
of
them
left
him
but
a
few
persisted
until
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
before
the
avantage
he
met
another
group
coming
from
the
voreux
old
mouque
and
chaval
were
there
since
the
death
of
his
daughter
mouquette
and
of
his
son
mouquet
the
old
man
had
continued
to
act
as
groom
without
a
word
of
regret
or
complaint
suddenly
when
he
saw
étienne
he
was
shaken
by
fury
tears
broke
out
from
his
eyes
and
a
flood
of
coarse
words
burst
from
his
mouth
black
and
bleeding
from
his
habit
of
chewing
tobacco
you
devil
you
bloody
swine
you
filthy
snout
wait
you
got
to
pay
me
for
my
poor
children
you
have
to
come
to
it
he
picked
up
a
brick
broke
it
and
threw
both
pieces
yes
yes
clear
him
off
shouted
chaval
who
was
grinning
in
excitement
delighted
at
this
vengeance
every
one
gets
his
turn
now
you
up
against
the
wall
you
dirty
hound
and
he
also
attacked
étienne
with
stones
a
savage
clamour
arose
they
all
took
up
bricks
broke
them
and
threw
them
to
rip
him
open
as
they
would
like
to
have
done
to
the
soldiers
he
was
dazed
and
could
not
flee
he
faced
them
trying
to
calm
them
with
phrases
his
old
speeches
once
so
warmly
received
came
back
to
his
lips
he
repeated
the
words
with
which
he
had
intoxicated
them
at
the
time
when
he
could
keep
them
in
hand
like
a
faithful
flock
but
his
power
was
dead
and
only
stones
replied
to
him
he
had
just
been
struck
on
the
left
arm
and
was
drawing
back
in
great
peril
when
he
found
himself
hemmed
in
against
the
front
of
the
avantage
for
the
last
few
moments
rasseneur
had
been
at
his
door
come
in
he
said
simply
étienne
hesitated
it
choked
him
to
take
refuge
there
come
in
then
i
speak
to
them
he
resigned
himself
and
took
refuge
at
the
other
end
of
the
parlour
while
the
innkeeper
filled
up
the
doorway
with
his
broad
shoulders
look
here
my
friends
just
be
reasonable
you
know
very
well
that
i
never
deceived
you
i
always
been
in
favour
of
quietness
and
if
you
had
listened
to
me
you
certainly
would
be
where
you
are
now
rolling
his
shoulders
and
belly
he
went
on
at
length
allowing
his
facile
eloquence
to
flow
with
the
lulling
gentleness
of
warm
water
and
all
his
old
success
came
back
he
regained
his
popularity
naturally
and
without
an
effort
as
if
he
had
never
been
hooted
and
called
a
coward
a
month
before
voices
arose
in
approval
very
good
we
are
with
you
that
is
the
way
to
put
it
thundering
applause
broke
out
étienne
in
the
background
grew
faint
and
there
was
bitterness
at
his
heart
he
recalled
rasseneur
prediction
in
the
forest
threatening
him
with
the
ingratitude
of
the
mob
what
imbecile
brutality
what
an
abominable
forgetfulness
of
old
services
it
was
a
blind
force
which
constantly
devoured
itself
and
beneath
his
anger
at
seeing
these
brutes
spoil
their
own
cause
there
was
despair
at
his
own
fall
and
the
tragic
end
of
his
ambition
what
was
it
already
done
for
he
remembered
hearing
beneath
the
beeches
three
thousand
hearts
beating
to
the
echo
of
his
own
on
that
day
he
had
held
his
popularity
in
both
hands
those
people
belonged
to
him
he
felt
that
he
was
their
master
mad
dreams
had
then
intoxicated
him
montsou
at
his
feet
paris
beyond
becoming
a
deputy
perhaps
crushing
the
middle
class
in
a
speech
the
first
speech
ever
pronounced
by
a
workman
in
a
parliament
and
it
was
all
over
he
awakened
miserable
and
detested
his
people
were
dismissing
him
by
flinging
bricks
rasseneur
voice
rose
higher
never
will
violence
succeed
the
world
ca
be
remade
in
a
day
those
who
have
promised
you
to
change
it
all
at
one
stroke
are
either
making
fun
of
you
or
they
are
rascals
bravo
bravo
shouted
the
crowd
who
then
was
the
guilty
one
and
this
question
which
étienne
put
to
himself
overwhelmed
him
more
than
ever
was
it
in
fact
his
fault
this
misfortune
which
was
making
him
bleed
the
wretchedness
of
some
the
murder
of
others
these
women
these
children
lean
and
without
bread
he
had
had
that
lamentable
vision
one
evening
before
the
catastrophe
but
then
a
force
was
lifting
him
he
was
carried
away
with
his
mates
besides
he
had
never
led
them
it
was
they
who
led
him
who
obliged
him
to
do
things
which
he
would
never
have
done
if
it
were
not
for
the
shock
of
that
crowd
pushing
behind
him
at
each
new
violence
he
had
been
stupefied
by
the
course
of
events
for
he
had
neither
foreseen
nor
desired
any
of
them
could
he
anticipate
for
instance
that
his
followers
in
the
settlement
would
one
day
stone
him
these
infuriated
people
lied
when
they
accused
him
of
having
promised
them
an
existence
all
fodder
and
laziness
and
in
this
justification
in
this
reasoning
in
which
he
tried
to
fight
against
his
remorse
was
hidden
the
anxiety
that
he
had
not
risen
to
the
height
of
his
task
it
was
the
doubt
of
the
man
still
perplexing
him
but
he
felt
himself
at
the
end
of
his
courage
he
was
no
longer
at
heart
with
his
mates
he
feared
this
enormous
mass
of
the
people
blind
and
irresistible
moving
like
a
force
of
nature
sweeping
away
everything
outside
rules
and
theories
a
certain
repugnance
was
detaching
him
from
them
the
discomfort
of
his
new
tastes
the
slow
movement
of
all
his
being
towards
a
superior
class
at
this
moment
rasseneur
voice
was
lost
in
the
midst
of
enthusiastic
shouts
hurrah
for
rasseneur
he
the
fellow
bravo
bravo
the
innkeeper
shut
the
door
while
the
band
dispersed
and
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
they
both
shrugged
their
shoulders
they
finished
up
by
having
a
drink
together
on
the
same
day
there
was
a
great
dinner
at
piolaine
they
were
celebrating
the
betrothal
of
négrel
and
cécile
since
the
previous
evening
the
grégoires
had
had
the
waxed
and
the
dusted
mélanie
reigned
in
the
kitchen
watching
over
the
roasts
and
stirring
the
sauces
the
odour
of
which
ascended
to
the
attics
it
had
been
decided
that
francis
the
coachman
should
help
honorine
to
wait
the
gardener
wife
would
wash
up
and
the
gardener
would
open
the
gate
never
had
the
substantial
patriarchal
old
house
been
in
such
a
state
of
gaiety
everything
went
off
beautifully
madame
hennebeau
was
charming
with
cécile
and
she
smiled
at
négrel
when
the
montsou
lawyer
gallantly
proposed
the
health
of
the
future
household
hennebeau
was
also
very
amiable
his
smiling
face
struck
the
guests
the
report
circulated
that
he
was
rising
in
favour
with
the
directors
and
that
he
would
soon
be
made
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honour
on
account
of
the
energetic
manner
in
which
he
had
put
down
the
strike
nothing
was
said
about
recent
events
but
there
was
an
air
of
triumph
in
the
general
joy
and
the
dinner
became
the
official
celebration
of
a
victory
at
last
then
they
were
saved
and
once
more
they
could
begin
to
eat
and
sleep
in
peace
a
discreet
allusion
was
made
to
those
dead
whose
blood
the
voreux
mud
had
yet
scarcely
drunk
up
it
was
a
necessary
lesson
and
they
were
all
affected
when
the
grégoires
added
that
it
was
now
the
duty
of
all
to
go
and
heal
the
wounds
in
the
settlements
they
had
regained
their
benevolent
placidity
excusing
their
brave
miners
whom
they
could
already
see
again
at
the
bottom
of
the
mines
giving
a
good
example
of
everlasting
resignation
the
montsou
notables
who
had
now
left
off
trembling
agreed
that
this
question
of
the
wage
system
ought
to
be
studied
cautiously
the
roasts
came
on
and
the
victory
became
complete
when
hennebeau
read
a
letter
from
the
bishop
announcing
abbé
ranvier
removal
the
middle
class
throughout
the
province
had
been
roused
to
anger
by
the
story
of
this
priest
who
treated
the
soldiers
as
murderers
and
when
the
dessert
appeared
the
lawyer
resolutely
declared
that
he
was
a
deneulin
was
there
with
his
two
daughters
in
the
midst
of
the
joy
he
forced
himself
to
hide
the
melancholy
of
his
ruin
that
very
morning
he
had
signed
the
sale
of
his
vandame
concession
to
the
montsou
company
with
the
knife
at
his
throat
he
had
submitted
to
the
demands
at
last
giving
up
to
them
that
prey
they
had
been
on
the
watch
for
so
long
scarcely
obtaining
from
them
the
money
necessary
to
pay
off
his
creditors
he
had
even
accepted
as
a
lucky
chance
at
the
last
moment
their
offer
to
keep
him
as
divisional
engineer
thus
resigning
himself
to
watch
as
a
simple
salaried
servant
over
that
pit
which
had
swallowed
up
his
fortune
it
was
the
knell
of
small
personal
enterprises
the
approaching
disappearance
of
the
masters
eaten
up
one
by
one
by
the
ogre
of
capital
drowned
in
the
rising
flood
of
great
companies
he
alone
paid
the
expenses
of
the
strike
he
understood
that
they
were
drinking
to
his
disaster
when
they
drank
to
hennebeau
rosette
and
he
only
consoled
himself
a
little
when
he
saw
the
fine
courage
of
lucie
and
jeanne
who
looked
charming
in
their
toilettes
laughing
at
the
downfall
like
happy
tomboys
disdainful
of
money
when
they
passed
into
the
for
coffee
grégoire
drew
his
cousin
aside
and
congratulated
him
on
the
courage
of
his
decision
what
would
you
have
your
real
mistake
was
to
risk
the
million
of
your
montsou
denier
over
vandame
you
gave
yourself
a
terrible
wound
and
it
has
melted
away
in
that
dog
labour
while
mine
which
has
not
stirred
from
my
drawer
still
keeps
me
comfortably
doing
nothing
as
it
will
keep
my
grandchildren
children
chapter
ii
on
sunday
étienne
escaped
from
the
settlement
at
nightfall
a
very
clear
sky
sprinkled
with
stars
lit
up
the
earth
with
the
blue
haze
of
twilight
he
went
down
towards
the
canal
and
followed
the
bank
slowly
in
the
direction
of
marchiennes
it
was
his
favourite
walk
a
path
two
leagues
long
passing
straight
beside
this
geometrical
which
unrolled
itself
like
an
endless
ingot
of
molten
silver
he
never
met
any
one
there
but
on
this
day
he
was
vexed
to
see
a
man
come
up
to
him
beneath
the
pale
starlight
the
two
solitary
walkers
only
recognized
each
other
when
they
were
face
to
face
what
is
it
you
said
étienne
souvarine
nodded
his
head
without
replying
for
a
moment
they
remained
motionless
then
side
by
side
they
set
out
towards
marchiennes
each
of
them
seemed
to
be
continuing
his
own
reflections
as
though
they
were
far
away
from
each
other
have
you
seen
in
the
paper
about
pluchart
success
at
paris
asked
étienne
at
length
after
that
meeting
at
belleville
they
waited
for
him
on
the
pavement
and
gave
him
an
ovation
oh
he
afloat
now
in
spite
of
his
sore
throat
he
can
do
what
he
likes
in
the
future
the
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
felt
contempt
for
fine
talkers
fellows
who
go
into
politics
as
one
goes
to
the
bar
to
get
an
income
out
of
phrases
étienne
was
now
studying
darwin
he
had
read
fragments
summarized
and
popularized
in
a
volume
and
out
of
this
reading
he
had
gained
for
himself
a
revolutionary
idea
of
the
struggle
for
existence
the
lean
eating
the
fat
the
strong
people
devouring
the
pallid
middle
class
but
souvarine
furiously
attacked
the
stupidity
of
the
socialists
who
accept
darwin
that
apostle
of
scientific
inequality
whose
famous
selection
was
only
good
for
aristocratic
philosophers
his
mate
persisted
however
wishing
to
reason
out
the
matter
and
expressing
his
doubts
by
an
hypothesis
supposing
the
old
society
were
no
longer
to
exist
swept
away
to
the
crumbs
well
was
it
not
to
be
feared
that
the
new
world
would
grow
up
again
slowly
spoilt
by
the
same
injustices
some
sick
and
others
flourishing
some
more
skilful
and
intelligent
fattening
on
everything
and
others
imbecile
and
lazy
becoming
slaves
again
but
before
this
vision
of
eternal
wretchedness
the
shouted
out
fiercely
that
if
justice
was
not
possible
with
man
then
man
must
disappear
for
every
rotten
society
there
must
be
a
massacre
until
the
last
creature
was
exterminated
and
there
was
silence
again
for
a
long
time
with
sunken
head
souvarine
walked
over
the
short
grass
so
absorbed
that
he
kept
to
the
extreme
edge
by
the
water
with
the
quiet
certainty
of
a
on
a
roof
then
he
shuddered
causelessly
as
though
he
had
stumbled
against
a
shadow
his
eyes
lifted
and
his
face
was
very
pale
he
said
softly
to
his
companion
did
i
ever
tell
you
how
she
died
whom
do
you
mean
my
wife
over
there
in
russia
étienne
made
a
vague
gesture
astonished
at
the
tremor
in
his
voice
and
at
the
sudden
desire
for
confidence
in
this
lad
who
was
usually
so
impassive
in
his
stoical
detachment
from
others
and
from
himself
he
only
knew
that
the
woman
was
his
mistress
and
that
she
had
been
hanged
at
moscow
the
affair
had
gone
off
souvarine
said
with
eyes
still
vacantly
following
the
white
stream
of
the
canal
between
the
bluish
colonnades
of
tall
trees
we
had
been
a
fortnight
at
the
bottom
of
a
hole
undermining
the
railway
and
it
was
not
the
imperial
train
that
was
blown
up
it
was
a
passenger
train
then
they
arrested
annutchka
she
brought
us
bread
every
evening
disguised
as
a
peasant
woman
she
lit
the
fuse
too
because
a
man
might
have
attracted
attention
i
followed
the
trial
hidden
in
the
crowd
for
six
days
his
voice
became
thick
and
he
coughed
as
though
he
were
choking
twice
i
wanted
to
cry
out
and
to
rush
over
the
people
heads
to
join
her
but
what
was
the
good
one
man
less
would
be
one
soldier
less
and
i
could
see
that
she
was
telling
me
not
to
come
when
her
large
eyes
met
mine
he
coughed
again
on
the
last
day
in
the
square
i
was
there
it
was
raining
they
stupidly
lost
their
heads
put
out
by
the
falling
rain
it
took
twenty
minutes
to
hang
the
other
four
the
cord
broke
they
could
not
finish
the
fourth
annutchka
was
standing
up
waiting
she
could
not
see
me
she
was
looking
for
me
in
the
crowd
i
got
on
to
a
post
and
she
saw
me
and
our
eyes
never
turned
from
each
other
when
she
was
dead
she
was
still
looking
at
me
i
waved
my
hat
i
came
away
there
was
silence
again
the
white
road
of
the
canal
unrolled
to
the
far
distance
and
they
both
walked
with
the
same
quiet
step
as
though
each
had
fallen
back
into
his
isolation
at
the
horizon
the
pale
water
seemed
to
open
the
sky
with
a
little
hole
of
light
it
was
our
punishment
souvarine
went
on
roughly
we
were
guilty
to
love
each
other
yes
it
is
well
that
she
is
dead
heroes
will
be
born
from
her
blood
and
i
no
longer
have
any
cowardice
at
my
heart
ah
nothing
neither
parents
nor
wife
nor
friend
nothing
to
make
my
hand
tremble
on
the
day
when
i
must
take
others
lives
or
give
up
my
own
étienne
had
stopped
shuddering
in
the
cool
night
he
discussed
no
more
he
simply
said
we
have
gone
far
shall
we
go
back
they
went
back
towards
the
voreux
slowly
and
he
added
after
a
few
paces
have
you
seen
the
new
placards
the
company
had
that
morning
put
up
some
more
large
yellow
posters
they
were
clearer
and
more
conciliatory
and
the
company
undertook
to
take
back
the
certificates
of
those
miners
who
went
down
on
the
following
day
everything
would
be
forgotten
and
pardon
was
offered
even
to
those
who
were
most
implicated
yes
i
seen
replied
the
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
that
it
all
up
the
flock
will
go
down
again
you
are
all
too
cowardly
étienne
feverishly
excused
his
mates
a
man
may
be
brave
a
mob
which
is
dying
of
hunger
has
no
strength
step
by
step
they
were
returning
to
the
voreux
and
before
the
black
mass
of
the
pit
he
continued
swearing
that
he
at
least
would
never
go
down
but
he
could
forgive
those
who
did
then
as
the
rumour
ran
that
the
carpenters
had
not
had
time
to
repair
the
tubbing
he
asked
for
information
was
it
true
had
the
weight
of
the
soil
against
the
timber
which
formed
the
internal
skirt
of
scaffolding
to
the
shaft
so
pushed
it
in
that
the
rubbed
as
they
went
down
for
a
length
of
over
fifty
metres
souvarine
who
once
more
became
uncommunicative
replied
briefly
he
had
been
working
the
day
before
and
the
cage
did
in
fact
jar
the
had
even
had
to
double
the
speed
to
pass
that
spot
but
all
the
bosses
received
any
observations
with
the
same
irritating
remark
it
was
coal
they
wanted
that
could
be
repaired
later
on
you
see
that
will
smash
up
étienne
murmured
it
will
be
a
fine
time
with
eyes
vaguely
fixed
on
the
pit
in
the
shadow
souvarine
quietly
concluded
if
it
does
smash
up
the
mates
will
know
it
since
you
advise
them
to
go
down
again
nine
struck
at
the
montsou
steeple
and
his
companion
having
said
that
he
was
going
to
bed
he
added
without
putting
out
his
hand
well
i
going
away
what
you
going
away
yes
i
asked
for
my
certificate
back
i
going
elsewhere
étienne
stupefied
and
affected
looked
at
him
after
walking
for
two
hours
he
said
that
to
him
and
in
so
calm
a
voice
while
the
mere
announcement
of
this
sudden
separation
made
his
own
heart
ache
they
had
got
to
know
each
other
they
had
toiled
together
that
always
makes
one
sad
the
idea
of
not
seeing
a
person
again
you
going
away
and
where
do
you
go
over
there
i
do
know
at
all
but
i
shall
see
you
again
no
i
think
not
they
were
silent
and
remained
for
a
moment
facing
each
other
without
finding
anything
to
say
then
while
étienne
ascended
toward
the
settlement
souvarine
turned
and
again
went
along
the
canal
bank
and
there
now
alone
he
continued
to
walk
with
sunken
head
so
lost
in
the
darkness
that
he
seemed
merely
a
moving
shadow
of
the
night
now
and
then
he
stopped
he
counted
the
hours
that
struck
afar
when
he
heard
midnight
strike
he
left
the
bank
and
turned
towards
the
voreux
at
that
time
the
pit
was
empty
and
he
only
met
a
captain
it
was
not
until
two
that
they
would
begin
to
get
up
steam
to
resume
work
first
he
went
to
take
from
a
cupboard
a
jacket
which
he
pretended
to
have
forgotten
various
tools
a
drill
armed
with
its
screw
a
small
but
very
strong
saw
a
hammer
and
a
chisel
were
rolled
up
in
this
jacket
then
he
left
but
instead
of
going
out
through
the
shed
he
passed
through
the
narrow
corridor
which
led
to
the
ladder
passage
with
his
jacket
under
his
arm
he
quietly
went
down
without
a
lamp
measuring
the
depth
by
counting
the
ladders
he
knew
that
the
cage
jarred
at
three
hundred
and
metres
against
the
fifth
row
of
the
lower
tubbing
when
he
had
counted
ladders
he
put
out
his
hand
and
was
able
to
feel
the
swelling
of
the
planking
it
was
there
then
with
the
skill
and
coolness
of
a
good
workman
who
has
been
reflecting
over
his
task
for
a
long
time
he
set
to
work
he
began
by
sawing
a
panel
in
the
brattice
so
as
to
communicate
with
the
with
the
help
of
matches
quickly
lighted
and
blown
out
he
was
then
able
to
ascertain
the
condition
of
the
tubbing
and
of
the
recent
repairs
between
calais
and
valenciennes
the
sinking
of
mine
shafts
was
surrounded
by
immense
difficulties
on
account
of
the
masses
of
subterranean
water
in
great
sheets
at
the
level
of
the
lowest
valleys
only
the
construction
of
tubbings
frameworks
jointed
like
the
stays
of
a
barrel
could
keep
out
the
springs
which
flow
in
and
isolate
the
shafts
in
the
midst
of
the
lakes
which
with
deep
obscure
waves
beat
against
the
walls
it
had
been
necessary
in
sinking
the
voreux
to
establish
two
tubbings
that
of
the
upper
level
in
the
shifting
sands
and
white
clays
bordering
the
chalky
stratum
and
fissured
in
every
part
swollen
with
water
like
a
sponge
then
that
of
the
lower
level
immediately
above
the
coal
stratum
in
a
yellow
sand
as
fine
as
flour
flowing
with
liquid
fluidity
it
was
here
that
the
torrent
was
to
be
found
that
subterranean
sea
so
dreaded
in
the
coal
pits
of
the
nord
a
sea
with
its
storms
and
its
shipwrecks
an
unknown
and
unfathomable
sea
rolling
its
dark
floods
more
than
three
hundred
metres
beneath
the
daylight
usually
the
tubbings
resisted
the
enormous
pressure
the
only
thing
to
be
dreaded
was
the
piling
up
of
the
neighbouring
soil
shaken
by
the
constant
movement
of
the
old
galleries
which
were
filling
up
in
this
descent
of
the
rocks
lines
of
fracture
were
sometimes
produced
which
slowly
extended
as
far
as
the
scaffolding
at
last
perforating
it
and
pushing
it
into
the
shaft
and
there
was
the
great
danger
of
a
landslip
and
a
flood
filling
the
pit
with
an
avalanche
of
earth
and
a
deluge
of
springs
souvarine
sitting
astride
in
the
opening
he
had
made
discovered
a
very
serious
defect
in
the
fifth
row
of
tubbing
the
wood
was
bellied
out
from
the
framework
several
planks
had
even
come
out
of
their
abundant
filtrations
the
miners
call
them
were
jetting
out
of
the
joints
through
the
tarred
oakum
with
which
they
were
caulked
the
carpenters
pressed
for
time
had
been
content
to
place
iron
squares
at
the
angles
so
carelessly
that
not
all
the
screws
were
put
in
a
considerable
movement
was
evidently
going
on
behind
in
the
sand
of
the
torrent
then
with
his
wimble
he
unscrewed
the
squares
so
that
another
push
would
tear
them
all
off
it
was
a
foolhardy
task
during
which
he
frequently
only
just
escaped
from
falling
headlong
down
the
hundred
and
eighty
metres
which
separated
him
from
the
bottom
he
had
been
obliged
to
seize
the
oak
guides
the
joists
along
which
the
cages
slid
and
suspended
over
the
void
he
traversed
the
length
of
the
with
which
they
were
joined
from
point
to
point
slipping
along
sitting
down
turning
over
simply
buttressing
himself
on
an
elbow
or
a
knee
with
tranquil
contempt
of
death
a
breath
would
have
sent
him
over
and
three
times
he
caught
himself
up
without
a
shudder
first
he
felt
with
his
hand
and
then
worked
only
lighting
a
match
when
he
lost
himself
in
the
midst
of
these
slimy
beams
after
loosening
the
screws
he
attacked
the
wood
itself
and
the
peril
became
still
greater
he
had
sought
for
the
key
the
piece
which
held
the
others
he
attacked
it
furiously
making
holes
in
it
sawing
it
thinning
it
so
that
it
lost
its
resistance
while
through
the
holes
and
the
cracks
the
water
which
escaped
in
small
jets
blinded
him
and
soaked
him
in
icy
rain
two
matches
were
extinguished
they
all
became
damp
and
then
there
was
night
the
bottomless
depth
of
darkness
from
this
moment
he
was
seized
by
rage
the
breath
of
the
invisible
intoxicated
him
the
black
horror
of
this
hole
urged
him
to
mad
destruction
he
wreaked
his
fury
at
random
against
the
tubbing
striking
where
he
could
with
his
wimble
with
his
saw
seized
by
the
desire
to
bring
the
whole
thing
at
once
down
on
his
head
he
brought
as
much
ferocity
to
the
task
as
though
he
had
been
digging
a
knife
into
the
skin
of
some
execrated
living
creature
he
would
kill
the
voreux
at
last
that
evil
beast
with
jaws
which
had
swallowed
so
much
human
flesh
the
bite
of
his
tools
could
be
heard
his
spine
lengthened
he
crawled
climbed
down
then
up
again
holding
on
by
a
miracle
in
continual
movement
the
flight
of
a
nocturnal
bird
amid
the
scaffolding
of
a
belfry
but
he
grew
calm
dissatisfied
with
himself
why
could
not
things
be
done
coolly
without
haste
he
took
breath
and
then
went
back
into
the
ladder
passage
stopping
up
the
hole
by
replacing
the
panel
which
he
had
sawn
that
was
enough
he
did
not
wish
to
raise
the
alarm
by
excessive
damage
which
would
have
been
repaired
immediately
the
beast
was
wounded
in
the
belly
we
should
see
if
it
was
still
alive
at
night
and
he
had
left
his
mark
the
frightened
world
would
know
that
the
beast
had
not
died
a
natural
death
he
took
his
time
in
methodically
rolling
up
his
tools
in
his
jacket
and
slowly
climbed
up
the
ladders
then
when
he
had
emerged
from
the
pit
without
being
seen
it
did
not
even
occur
to
him
to
go
and
change
his
clothes
three
struck
he
remained
standing
on
the
road
waiting
at
the
same
hour
étienne
who
was
not
asleep
was
disturbed
by
a
slight
sound
in
the
thick
night
of
the
room
he
distinguished
the
low
breath
of
the
children
and
the
snoring
of
bonnemort
and
maheude
while
jeanlin
near
him
was
breathing
with
a
prolonged
whistle
no
doubt
he
had
dreamed
and
he
was
turning
back
when
the
noise
began
again
it
was
the
creaking
of
a
palliasse
the
stifled
effort
of
someone
who
is
getting
up
then
he
imagined
that
catherine
must
be
i
say
is
it
you
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
no
one
replied
and
the
snoring
of
the
others
continued
for
five
minutes
nothing
stirred
then
there
was
fresh
creaking
feeling
certain
this
time
that
he
was
not
mistaken
he
crossed
the
room
putting
his
hands
out
into
the
darkness
to
feel
the
opposite
bed
he
was
surprised
to
find
the
young
girl
sitting
up
holding
in
her
breath
awake
and
on
the
watch
well
why
do
you
reply
what
are
you
doing
then
at
last
she
said
i
getting
up
getting
up
at
this
hour
yes
i
going
back
to
work
at
the
pit
étienne
felt
deeply
moved
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
palliasse
while
catherine
explained
her
reasons
to
him
she
suffered
too
much
by
living
thus
in
idleness
feeling
continual
looks
of
reproach
weighing
on
her
she
would
rather
run
the
risk
of
being
knocked
about
down
there
by
chaval
and
if
her
mother
refused
to
take
her
money
when
she
brought
it
well
she
was
big
enough
to
act
for
herself
and
make
her
own
soup
go
away
i
want
to
dress
and
do
say
anything
will
you
if
you
want
to
be
kind
but
he
remained
near
her
he
had
put
his
arms
round
her
waist
in
a
caress
of
grief
and
pity
pressed
one
against
the
other
in
their
shirts
they
could
feel
the
warmth
of
each
other
naked
flesh
at
the
edge
of
this
bed
still
moist
with
the
night
sleep
she
had
at
first
tried
to
free
herself
then
she
began
to
cry
quietly
in
her
turn
taking
him
by
the
neck
to
press
him
against
her
in
a
despairing
clasp
and
they
remained
without
any
further
desires
with
the
past
of
their
unfortunate
love
which
they
had
not
been
able
to
satisfy
was
it
then
done
with
for
ever
would
they
never
dare
to
love
each
other
some
day
now
that
they
were
free
it
only
needed
a
little
happiness
to
dissipate
their
shame
that
awkwardness
which
prevented
them
from
coming
together
because
of
all
sorts
of
ideas
which
they
themselves
could
not
read
clearly
go
to
bed
again
she
whispered
i
do
want
to
light
up
it
would
wake
mother
it
is
time
leave
me
he
could
not
hear
he
was
pressing
her
wildly
with
a
heart
drowned
in
immense
sadness
the
need
for
peace
an
irresistible
need
for
happiness
was
carrying
him
away
and
he
saw
himself
married
in
a
neat
little
house
with
no
other
ambition
than
to
live
and
to
die
there
both
of
them
together
he
would
be
satisfied
with
bread
and
if
there
were
only
enough
for
one
she
should
have
it
what
was
the
good
of
anything
else
was
there
anything
in
life
worth
more
but
she
was
unfolding
her
naked
arms
please
leave
me
then
in
a
sudden
impulse
he
said
in
her
ear
wait
i
coming
with
you
and
he
was
himself
surprised
at
what
he
had
said
he
had
sworn
never
to
go
down
again
whence
then
came
this
sudden
decision
arising
from
his
lips
without
thought
of
his
without
even
a
moment
discussion
there
was
now
such
calm
within
him
so
complete
a
cure
of
his
doubts
that
he
persisted
like
a
man
saved
by
chance
who
has
at
last
found
the
only
harbour
from
his
torment
so
he
refused
to
listen
to
her
when
she
became
alarmed
understanding
that
he
was
devoting
himself
for
her
and
fearing
the
ill
words
which
would
greet
him
at
the
pit
he
laughed
at
everything
the
placards
promised
pardon
and
that
was
enough
i
want
to
work
that
my
idea
let
us
dress
and
make
no
noise
they
dressed
themselves
in
the
darkness
with
a
thousand
precautions
she
had
secretly
prepared
her
miner
clothes
the
evening
before
he
took
a
jacket
and
breeches
from
the
cupboard
and
they
did
not
wash
themselves
for
fear
of
knocking
the
bowl
all
were
asleep
but
they
had
to
cross
the
narrow
passage
where
the
mother
slept
when
they
started
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
they
stumbled
against
a
chair
she
woke
and
asked
drowsily
eh
what
is
it
catherine
had
stopped
trembling
and
violently
pressing
étienne
hand
it
me
do
trouble
yourself
he
said
i
feel
stifled
and
am
going
outside
to
breathe
a
bit
very
well
and
maheude
fell
asleep
again
catherine
dared
not
stir
at
last
she
went
down
into
the
parlour
and
divided
a
slice
of
which
she
had
reserved
from
a
loaf
given
by
a
montsou
lady
then
they
softly
closed
the
door
and
went
away
souvarine
had
remained
standing
near
the
avantage
at
the
corner
of
the
road
for
half
an
hour
he
had
been
looking
at
the
colliers
who
were
returning
to
work
in
the
darkness
passing
by
with
the
dull
tramp
of
a
herd
he
was
counting
them
as
a
butcher
counts
his
beasts
at
the
entrance
to
the
and
he
was
surprised
at
their
number
even
his
pessimism
had
not
foreseen
that
the
number
of
cowards
would
have
been
so
great
the
stream
continued
to
pass
by
and
he
grew
stiff
very
cold
with
clenched
teeth
and
bright
eyes
but
he
started
among
the
men
passing
by
whose
faces
he
could
not
distinguish
he
had
just
recognized
one
by
his
walk
he
came
forward
and
stopped
him
where
are
you
going
to
étienne
in
surprise
instead
of
replying
stammered
what
you
not
set
out
yet
then
he
confessed
he
was
going
back
to
the
pit
no
doubt
he
had
sworn
only
it
could
not
be
called
life
to
wait
with
folded
arms
for
things
which
would
perhaps
happen
in
a
hundred
years
and
besides
reasons
of
his
own
had
decided
him
souvarine
had
listened
to
him
shuddering
he
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
and
pushed
him
towards
the
settlement
go
home
again
i
want
you
to
do
you
understand
but
catherine
having
approached
he
recognized
her
also
étienne
protested
declaring
that
he
allowed
no
one
to
judge
his
conduct
and
the
eyes
went
from
the
young
girl
to
her
companion
while
he
stepped
back
with
a
sudden
relinquishing
movement
when
there
was
a
woman
in
a
man
heart
that
man
was
done
for
he
might
die
perhaps
he
saw
again
in
a
rapid
vision
his
mistress
hanging
over
there
at
moscow
that
last
link
cut
from
his
flesh
which
had
rendered
him
free
of
the
lives
of
others
and
of
his
own
life
he
said
simply
go
étienne
feeling
awkward
was
delaying
and
trying
to
find
some
friendly
word
so
as
not
to
separate
in
this
manner
then
you
still
going
yes
well
give
me
your
hand
old
chap
a
pleasant
journey
and
no
ill
feeling
the
other
stretched
out
an
icy
hand
neither
friend
nor
wife
for
good
this
time
yes
and
souvarine
standing
motionless
in
the
darkness
watched
étienne
and
catherine
entering
the
voreux
chapter
iii
at
four
the
descent
began
dansaert
who
was
personally
installed
at
the
marker
office
in
the
lamp
cabin
wrote
down
the
name
of
each
worker
who
presented
himself
and
had
a
lamp
given
to
him
he
took
them
all
without
remark
keeping
to
the
promise
of
the
placards
when
however
he
noticed
étienne
and
catherine
at
the
wicket
he
started
and
became
very
red
and
was
opening
his
mouth
to
refuse
their
names
then
he
contented
himself
with
the
triumph
and
a
jeer
ah
ah
so
the
strong
man
was
thrown
the
company
was
then
in
luck
since
the
terrible
montsou
wrestler
had
come
back
to
it
to
ask
for
bread
étienne
silently
took
his
lamp
and
went
towards
the
shaft
with
the
putter
but
it
was
there
in
the
that
catherine
feared
the
mates
bad
words
at
the
very
entrance
she
recognized
chaval
in
the
midst
of
some
twenty
miners
waiting
till
a
cage
was
free
he
came
furiously
towards
her
but
the
sight
of
étienne
stopped
him
then
he
affected
to
sneer
with
an
offensive
shrug
of
the
shoulders
very
good
he
did
care
a
hang
since
the
other
had
come
to
occupy
the
place
that
was
still
warm
good
riddance
it
only
concerned
the
gentleman
if
he
liked
the
leavings
and
beneath
the
exhibition
of
this
contempt
he
was
again
seized
by
a
tremor
of
jealousy
and
his
eyes
flamed
for
the
rest
the
mates
did
not
stir
standing
silent
with
eyes
lowered
they
contented
themselves
with
casting
a
sidelong
look
at
the
then
dejected
and
without
anger
they
again
stared
fixedly
at
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
with
their
lamps
in
their
hands
shivering
beneath
their
thin
jackets
in
the
constant
draughts
of
this
large
room
at
last
the
cage
was
wedged
on
to
the
keeps
and
they
were
ordered
to
get
in
catherine
and
étienne
were
squeezed
in
one
tram
already
containing
pierron
and
two
pikemen
beside
them
in
the
other
tram
chaval
was
loudly
saying
to
father
mouque
that
the
directors
had
made
a
mistake
in
not
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
free
the
pits
of
the
blackguards
who
were
corrupting
them
but
the
old
groom
who
had
already
fallen
back
into
the
resignation
of
his
existence
no
longer
grew
angry
over
the
death
of
his
children
and
simply
replied
by
a
gesture
of
conciliation
the
cage
freed
itself
and
slipped
down
into
the
darkness
no
one
spoke
suddenly
when
they
were
in
the
middle
third
of
the
descent
there
was
a
terrible
jarring
the
iron
creaked
and
the
men
were
thrown
on
to
each
other
by
god
growled
étienne
are
they
going
to
flatten
us
we
shall
end
by
being
left
here
for
good
with
their
confounded
tubbing
and
they
talk
about
having
repaired
it
the
cage
had
however
cleared
the
obstacle
it
was
now
descending
beneath
so
violent
a
rain
like
a
storm
that
the
workmen
anxiously
listened
to
the
pouring
a
number
of
leaks
must
then
have
appeared
in
the
caulking
of
the
joints
pierron
who
had
been
working
for
several
days
when
asked
about
it
did
not
like
to
show
his
fear
which
might
be
considered
as
an
attack
on
the
management
so
he
only
replied
oh
no
danger
it
always
like
that
no
doubt
they
not
had
time
to
caulk
the
leaks
the
torrent
was
roaring
over
their
heads
and
they
at
last
reached
the
beneath
a
veritable
waterspout
not
one
of
the
captains
had
thought
of
climbing
up
the
ladders
to
investigate
the
matter
the
pump
would
be
enough
the
carpenters
would
examine
the
joints
the
following
night
the
reorganization
of
work
in
the
galleries
gave
considerable
trouble
before
allowing
the
pikemen
to
return
to
their
hewing
cells
the
engineer
had
decided
that
for
the
first
five
days
all
the
men
should
execute
certain
works
of
consolidation
which
were
extremely
urgent
landslips
were
threatening
everywhere
the
passages
had
suffered
to
such
an
extent
that
the
timbering
had
to
be
repaired
along
a
length
of
several
hundred
metres
gangs
of
ten
men
were
therefore
formed
below
each
beneath
the
control
of
a
captain
then
they
were
set
to
work
at
the
most
damaged
spots
when
the
descent
was
complete
it
was
found
that
three
hundred
and
miners
had
gone
down
about
half
of
those
who
worked
there
when
the
pit
was
in
full
swing
chaval
belonged
to
the
same
gang
as
catherine
and
étienne
this
was
not
by
chance
he
had
at
first
hidden
behind
his
mates
and
had
then
forced
the
captain
hand
this
gang
went
to
the
end
of
the
north
gallery
nearly
three
kilometres
away
to
clear
out
a
landslip
which
was
stopping
up
a
gallery
in
the
seam
they
attacked
the
fallen
rocks
with
shovel
and
pick
étienne
chaval
and
five
others
cleared
away
the
rubbish
while
catherine
with
two
trammers
wheeled
the
earth
up
to
the
upbrow
they
seldom
spoke
and
the
captain
never
left
them
the
putter
two
lovers
however
were
on
the
point
of
coming
to
blows
while
growling
that
he
had
had
enough
of
this
trollop
chaval
was
still
thinking
of
her
and
slyly
hustling
her
about
so
that
étienne
had
threatened
to
settle
him
if
he
did
not
leave
her
alone
they
eyed
each
other
fiercely
and
had
to
be
separated
towards
eight
dansaert
passed
to
give
a
glance
at
the
work
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
very
bad
humour
and
was
furious
with
the
captain
nothing
had
gone
well
what
was
the
meaning
of
such
work
the
planking
would
everywhere
have
to
be
done
over
again
and
he
went
away
declaring
that
he
would
come
back
with
the
engineer
he
had
been
waiting
for
négrel
since
morning
and
could
not
understand
the
cause
of
this
delay
another
hour
passed
by
the
captain
had
stopped
the
removal
of
the
rubbish
to
employ
all
his
people
in
supporting
the
roof
even
the
putter
and
the
two
trammers
left
off
wheeling
to
prepare
and
bring
pieces
of
timber
at
this
end
of
the
gallery
the
gang
formed
a
sort
of
advance
guard
at
the
very
extremity
of
the
mine
now
without
communication
with
the
other
stalls
three
or
four
times
strange
noises
distant
rushes
made
the
workers
turn
their
heads
to
listen
what
was
it
then
one
would
have
said
that
the
passages
were
being
emptied
and
the
mates
already
returning
at
a
running
pace
but
the
sound
was
lost
in
the
deep
silence
and
they
set
to
wedging
their
wood
again
dazed
by
the
loud
blows
of
the
hammer
at
last
they
returned
to
the
rubbish
and
the
wheeling
began
once
more
catherine
came
back
from
her
first
journey
in
terror
saying
that
no
one
was
to
be
found
at
the
upbrow
i
called
but
there
was
no
reply
they
all
cleared
out
of
the
place
the
bewilderment
was
so
great
that
the
ten
men
threw
down
their
tools
to
rush
away
the
idea
that
they
were
abandoned
left
alone
at
the
bottom
of
the
mine
so
far
from
the
drove
them
wild
they
only
kept
their
lamps
and
ran
in
single
file
the
men
the
boys
the
putter
the
captain
himself
lost
his
head
and
shouted
out
appeals
more
and
more
frightened
at
the
silence
in
this
endless
desert
of
galleries
what
then
had
happened
that
they
did
not
meet
a
soul
what
accident
could
thus
have
driven
away
their
mates
their
terror
was
increased
by
the
uncertainty
of
the
danger
this
threat
which
they
felt
there
without
knowing
what
it
was
when
they
at
last
came
near
the
a
torrent
barred
their
road
they
were
at
once
in
water
to
the
knees
and
were
no
longer
able
to
run
laboriously
fording
the
flood
with
the
thought
that
one
delay
might
mean
death
by
god
it
the
tubbing
that
given
way
cried
étienne
i
said
we
should
be
left
here
for
good
since
the
descent
pierron
had
anxiously
observed
the
increase
of
the
deluge
which
fell
from
the
shaft
as
with
two
others
he
loaded
the
trams
he
raised
his
head
his
face
covered
with
large
drops
and
his
ears
ringing
with
the
roar
of
the
tempest
above
but
he
trembled
especially
when
he
noticed
that
the
sump
beneath
him
that
pit
ten
metres
deep
was
filling
the
water
was
already
spurting
through
the
floor
and
covering
the
metal
plates
this
showed
that
the
pump
was
no
longer
sufficient
to
fight
against
the
leaks
he
heard
it
panting
with
the
groan
of
fatigue
then
he
warned
dansaert
who
swore
angrily
replying
that
they
must
wait
for
the
engineer
twice
he
returned
to
the
charge
without
extracting
anything
else
but
exasperated
shrugs
of
the
shoulder
well
the
water
was
rising
what
could
he
do
mouque
appeared
with
bataille
whom
he
was
leading
to
work
and
he
had
to
hold
him
with
both
hands
for
the
sleepy
old
horse
had
suddenly
reared
up
and
with
a
shrill
neigh
was
stretching
his
head
towards
the
shaft
well
philosopher
what
troubles
you
ah
it
because
it
rains
come
along
that
does
concern
you
but
the
beast
quivered
all
over
his
skin
and
mouque
forcibly
drew
him
to
the
haulage
gallery
almost
at
the
same
moment
as
mouque
and
bataille
were
disappearing
at
the
end
of
a
gallery
there
was
a
crackling
in
the
air
followed
by
the
prolonged
noise
of
a
fall
it
was
a
piece
of
tubbing
which
had
got
loose
and
was
falling
a
hundred
and
eighty
metres
down
rebounding
against
the
walls
pierron
and
the
other
porters
were
able
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
the
oak
plank
only
smashed
an
empty
tram
at
the
same
time
a
mass
of
water
the
leaping
flood
of
a
broken
dyke
rushed
down
dansaert
proposed
to
go
up
and
examine
but
while
he
was
still
speaking
another
piece
rolled
down
and
in
terror
before
the
threatening
catastrophe
he
no
longer
hesitated
but
gave
the
order
to
go
up
sending
captains
to
warn
the
men
in
their
stalls
then
a
terrible
hustling
began
from
every
gallery
rows
of
workers
came
rushing
up
trying
to
take
the
cages
by
assault
they
crushed
madly
against
each
other
in
order
to
be
taken
up
at
once
some
who
had
thought
of
trying
the
ladder
passage
came
down
again
shouting
that
it
was
already
stopped
up
that
was
the
terror
they
all
felt
each
time
that
the
cage
rose
this
time
it
was
able
to
pass
but
who
knew
if
it
would
be
able
to
pass
again
in
the
midst
of
the
obstacles
obstructing
the
shaft
the
downfall
must
be
continuing
above
for
a
series
of
low
detonations
was
heard
the
planks
were
splitting
and
bursting
amid
the
continuous
and
increasing
roar
of
a
storm
one
cage
soon
became
useless
broken
in
and
no
longer
sliding
between
the
guides
which
were
doubtless
broken
the
other
jarred
to
such
a
degree
that
the
cable
would
certainly
break
soon
and
there
remained
a
hundred
men
to
be
taken
up
all
panting
clinging
to
one
another
bleeding
and
two
were
killed
by
falls
of
planking
a
third
who
had
seized
the
cage
fell
back
fifty
metres
up
and
disappeared
in
the
sump
dansaert
however
was
trying
to
arrange
matters
in
an
orderly
manner
armed
with
a
pick
he
threatened
to
open
the
skull
of
the
first
man
who
refused
to
obey
and
he
tried
to
arrange
them
in
file
shouting
that
the
porters
were
to
go
up
last
after
having
sent
up
their
mates
he
was
not
listened
to
and
he
had
to
prevent
the
pale
and
cowardly
pierron
from
entering
among
the
first
at
each
departure
he
pushed
him
aside
with
a
blow
but
his
own
teeth
were
chattering
a
minute
more
and
he
would
be
swallowed
up
everything
was
smashing
up
there
a
flood
had
broken
loose
a
murderous
rain
of
scaffolding
a
few
men
were
still
running
up
when
mad
with
fear
he
jumped
into
a
tram
allowing
pierron
to
jump
in
behind
him
the
cage
rose
at
this
moment
the
gang
to
which
étienne
and
chaval
belonged
had
just
reached
the
they
saw
the
cage
disappear
and
rushed
forward
but
they
had
to
draw
back
from
the
final
downfall
of
the
tubbing
the
shaft
was
stopped
up
and
the
cage
would
not
come
down
again
catherine
was
sobbing
and
chaval
was
choked
with
shouting
oaths
there
were
twenty
of
them
were
those
bloody
bosses
going
to
abandon
them
thus
father
mouque
who
had
brought
back
bataille
without
hurrying
was
still
holding
him
by
the
bridle
both
of
them
stupefied
the
man
and
the
beast
in
the
face
of
this
rapid
flow
of
the
inundation
the
water
was
already
rising
to
their
thighs
étienne
in
silence
with
clenched
teeth
supported
catherine
between
his
arms
and
the
twenty
yelled
with
their
faces
turned
up
obstinately
gazing
at
the
shaft
like
imbeciles
that
shifting
hole
which
was
belching
out
a
flood
and
from
which
no
help
could
henceforth
come
to
them
at
the
surface
dansaert
on
arriving
perceived
négrel
running
up
by
some
fatality
madame
hennebeau
had
that
morning
delayed
him
on
rising
turning
over
the
leaves
of
catalogues
for
the
purchase
of
wedding
presents
it
was
ten
well
what
happening
then
he
shouted
from
afar
the
pit
is
ruined
replied
the
head
captain
and
he
described
the
catastrophe
in
a
few
stammered
words
while
the
engineer
incredulously
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
could
tubbing
be
demolished
like
that
they
were
exaggerating
he
would
make
an
examination
i
suppose
no
one
has
been
left
at
the
bottom
dansaert
was
confused
no
no
one
at
least
so
he
hoped
but
some
of
the
men
might
have
been
delayed
but
said
négrel
what
in
the
name
of
creation
have
you
come
up
for
then
you
ca
leave
your
men
he
immediately
gave
orders
to
count
the
lamps
in
the
morning
three
hundred
and
had
been
distributed
and
now
only
two
hundred
and
could
be
found
but
several
men
acknowledged
that
in
the
hustling
and
panic
they
had
dropped
theirs
and
left
them
behind
an
attempt
was
made
to
call
over
the
men
but
it
was
impossible
to
establish
the
exact
number
some
of
the
miners
had
gone
away
others
did
not
hear
their
names
no
one
was
agreed
as
to
the
number
of
the
missing
mates
it
might
be
twenty
perhaps
forty
and
the
engineer
could
only
make
out
one
thing
with
certainty
there
were
men
down
below
for
their
yells
could
be
distinguished
through
the
sound
of
the
water
and
the
fallen
scaffolding
on
leaning
over
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
négrel
first
care
was
to
send
for
hennebeau
and
to
try
to
close
the
pit
but
it
was
already
too
late
the
colliers
who
had
rushed
to
the
settlement
as
though
pursued
by
the
cracking
tubbing
had
frightened
the
families
and
bands
of
women
old
men
and
little
ones
came
running
up
shaken
by
cries
and
sobs
they
had
to
be
pushed
back
and
a
line
of
overseers
was
formed
to
keep
them
off
for
they
would
have
interfered
with
the
operations
many
of
the
men
who
had
come
up
from
the
shaft
remained
there
stupidly
without
thinking
of
changing
their
clothes
riveted
by
fear
before
this
terrible
hole
in
which
they
had
nearly
remained
for
ever
the
women
rushing
wildly
around
them
implored
them
for
names
was
among
them
and
that
one
and
this
one
they
did
not
know
they
stammered
they
shuddered
terribly
and
made
gestures
like
madmen
gestures
which
seemed
to
be
pushing
away
some
abominable
vision
which
was
always
present
to
them
the
crowd
rapidly
increased
and
lamentations
arose
from
the
roads
and
up
there
on
the
in
bonnemort
cabin
on
the
ground
was
seated
a
man
souvarine
who
had
not
gone
away
who
was
looking
on
the
names
the
names
cried
the
women
with
voices
choked
by
tears
négrel
appeared
for
a
moment
and
said
hurriedly
as
soon
as
we
know
the
names
they
shall
be
given
out
but
nothing
is
lost
so
far
every
one
will
be
saved
i
am
going
down
then
silent
with
anguish
the
crowd
waited
the
engineer
in
fact
with
quiet
courage
was
preparing
to
go
down
he
had
had
the
cage
unfastened
giving
orders
to
replace
it
at
the
end
of
the
cable
by
a
tub
and
as
he
feared
that
the
water
would
extinguish
his
lamp
he
had
another
fastened
beneath
the
tub
which
would
protect
it
several
captains
trembling
and
with
white
disturbed
faces
assisted
in
these
preparations
you
will
come
with
me
dansaert
said
négrel
abruptly
then
when
he
saw
them
all
without
courage
and
that
the
head
captain
was
tottering
giddy
with
terror
he
pushed
him
aside
with
a
movement
of
contempt
no
you
will
be
in
my
way
i
would
rather
go
alone
he
was
already
in
the
narrow
bucket
which
swayed
at
the
end
of
the
cable
and
holding
his
lamp
in
one
hand
and
the
in
the
other
he
shouted
to
the
gently
the
engine
set
the
drums
in
movement
and
négrel
disappeared
in
the
gulf
from
which
the
yells
of
the
wretches
below
still
arose
at
the
upper
part
nothing
had
moved
he
found
that
the
tubbing
here
was
in
good
condition
balanced
in
the
middle
of
the
shaft
he
lighted
up
the
walls
as
he
turned
round
the
leaks
between
the
joints
were
so
slight
that
his
lamp
did
not
suffer
but
at
three
hundred
metres
when
he
reached
the
lower
tubbing
the
lamp
was
extinguished
as
he
expected
for
a
jet
had
filled
the
tub
after
that
he
was
only
able
to
see
by
the
hanging
lamp
which
preceded
him
in
the
darkness
and
in
spite
of
his
courage
he
shuddered
and
turned
pale
in
the
face
of
the
horror
of
the
disaster
a
few
pieces
of
timber
alone
remained
the
others
had
fallen
in
with
their
frames
behind
enormous
cavities
had
been
hollowed
out
and
the
yellow
sand
as
fine
as
flour
was
flowing
in
considerable
masses
while
the
waters
of
the
torrent
that
subterranean
sea
with
its
unknown
tempests
and
shipwrecks
were
discharging
in
a
flow
like
a
weir
he
went
down
lower
lost
in
the
midst
of
these
chasms
which
continued
to
multiply
beaten
and
turned
round
by
the
waterspout
of
the
springs
so
badly
lighted
by
the
red
star
of
the
lamp
moving
on
below
that
he
seemed
to
distinguish
the
roads
and
squares
of
some
destroyed
town
far
away
in
the
play
of
the
great
moving
shadows
no
human
work
was
any
longer
possible
his
only
remaining
hope
was
to
attempt
to
save
the
men
in
peril
as
he
sank
down
he
heard
the
cries
becoming
louder
and
he
was
obliged
to
stop
an
impassable
obstacle
barred
the
shaft
a
mass
of
scaffolding
the
broken
joists
of
the
guides
the
split
brattices
entangled
with
the
torn
from
the
pump
as
he
looked
on
for
a
long
time
with
aching
heart
the
yelling
suddenly
ceased
no
doubt
the
rapid
rise
of
the
water
had
forced
the
wretches
to
flee
into
the
galleries
if
indeed
the
flood
had
not
already
filled
their
mouths
négrel
resigned
himself
to
pulling
the
as
a
sign
to
draw
up
then
he
had
himself
stopped
again
he
could
not
conceive
the
cause
of
this
sudden
accident
he
wished
to
investigate
it
and
examined
those
pieces
of
the
tubbing
which
were
still
in
place
at
a
distance
the
tears
and
cuts
in
the
wood
had
surprised
him
his
lamp
drowned
in
dampness
was
going
out
and
touching
with
his
fingers
he
clearly
recognized
the
marks
of
the
saw
and
of
the
wimble
the
whole
abominable
labour
of
destruction
evidently
this
catastrophe
had
been
intentionally
produced
he
was
stupefied
and
the
pieces
of
timber
cracking
and
falling
down
with
their
frames
in
a
last
slide
nearly
carried
him
with
them
his
courage
fled
the
thought
of
the
man
who
had
done
that
made
his
hair
stand
on
end
and
froze
him
with
a
supernatural
fear
of
evil
as
though
mixed
with
the
darkness
the
men
were
still
there
paying
for
his
immeasurable
crime
he
shouted
and
shook
the
cord
furiously
and
it
was
indeed
time
for
he
perceived
that
the
upper
tubbing
a
hundred
metres
higher
was
in
its
turn
beginning
to
move
the
joints
were
opening
losing
their
oakum
caulking
and
streams
were
rushing
through
it
was
now
only
a
question
of
hours
before
the
tubbing
would
all
fall
down
at
the
surface
hennebeau
was
anxiously
waiting
for
négrel
well
what
he
asked
but
the
engineer
was
choked
and
could
not
speak
he
felt
faint
it
is
not
possible
such
a
thing
was
never
seen
have
you
examined
he
nodded
with
a
cautious
look
he
refused
to
talk
in
the
presence
of
some
captains
who
were
listening
and
led
his
uncle
ten
metres
away
and
not
thinking
this
far
enough
drew
still
farther
back
then
in
a
low
whisper
he
at
last
told
of
the
outrage
the
torn
and
sawn
planks
the
pit
bleeding
at
the
neck
and
groaning
turning
pale
the
manager
also
lowered
his
voice
with
that
instinctive
need
of
silence
in
face
of
the
monstrosity
of
great
orgies
and
great
crimes
it
was
useless
to
look
as
though
they
were
trembling
before
the
ten
thousand
montsou
men
later
on
they
would
see
and
they
both
continued
whispering
overcome
at
the
thought
that
a
man
had
had
the
courage
to
go
down
to
hang
in
the
midst
of
space
to
risk
his
life
twenty
times
over
in
his
terrible
task
they
could
not
even
understand
this
mad
courage
in
destruction
they
refused
to
believe
in
spite
of
the
evidence
just
as
we
doubt
those
stories
of
celebrated
escapes
of
prisoners
who
fly
through
windows
thirty
metres
above
the
ground
when
hennebeau
came
back
to
the
captains
a
nervous
spasm
was
drawing
his
face
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair
and
gave
orders
that
the
mine
should
be
evacuated
at
once
it
was
a
kind
of
funeral
procession
in
silent
abandonment
with
glances
thrown
back
at
those
great
masses
of
bricks
empty
and
still
standing
but
which
nothing
henceforth
could
save
and
as
the
manager
and
the
engineer
came
down
last
from
the
the
crowd
met
them
with
its
clamour
repeating
obstinately
the
names
the
names
tell
us
the
names
maheude
was
now
there
among
the
women
she
recollected
the
noise
in
the
night
her
daughter
and
the
lodger
must
have
gone
away
together
and
they
were
certainly
down
at
the
bottom
and
after
having
cried
that
it
was
a
good
thing
that
they
deserved
to
stay
there
the
heartless
cowards
she
had
run
up
and
was
standing
in
the
first
row
trembling
with
anguish
besides
she
no
longer
dared
to
doubt
the
discussion
going
on
around
her
informed
her
as
to
the
names
of
those
who
were
down
yes
yes
catherine
was
among
them
étienne
also
a
mate
had
seen
them
but
there
was
not
always
agreement
with
regard
to
the
others
no
not
this
one
on
the
contrary
that
one
perhaps
chaval
with
whom
however
a
trammer
declared
that
he
had
ascended
the
levaque
and
pierronne
although
none
of
their
people
were
in
danger
cried
out
and
lamented
as
loudly
as
the
others
zacharie
who
had
come
up
among
the
first
in
spite
of
his
inclination
to
make
fun
of
everything
had
weepingly
kissed
his
wife
and
mother
and
remained
near
the
latter
quivering
and
showing
an
unexpected
degree
of
affection
for
his
sister
refusing
to
believe
that
she
was
below
so
long
as
the
bosses
made
no
authoritative
statement
the
names
the
names
for
pity
sake
the
names
négrel
who
was
exhausted
shouted
to
the
overseers
ca
you
make
them
be
still
it
enough
to
kill
one
with
vexation
we
do
know
the
names
two
hours
passed
away
in
this
manner
in
the
first
terror
no
one
had
thought
of
the
other
shaft
at
the
old
réquillart
mine
hennebeau
was
about
to
announce
that
the
rescue
would
be
attempted
from
that
side
when
a
rumour
ran
round
five
men
had
just
escaped
the
inundation
by
climbing
up
the
rotten
ladders
of
the
old
unused
passage
and
father
mouque
was
named
this
caused
surprise
for
no
one
knew
he
was
below
but
the
narrative
of
the
five
who
had
escaped
increased
the
weeping
fifteen
mates
had
not
been
able
to
follow
them
having
gone
astray
and
been
walled
up
by
falls
and
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
assist
them
for
there
were
already
ten
metres
of
water
in
réquillart
all
the
names
were
known
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
groans
of
a
slaughtered
multitude
will
you
make
them
be
still
négrel
repeated
furiously
make
them
draw
back
yes
yes
to
a
hundred
metres
there
is
danger
push
them
back
push
them
back
it
was
necessary
to
struggle
against
these
poor
people
they
were
imagining
all
sorts
of
misfortunes
and
they
had
to
be
driven
away
so
that
the
deaths
might
be
concealed
the
captains
explained
to
them
that
the
shaft
would
destroy
the
whole
mine
this
idea
rendered
them
mute
with
terror
and
they
at
last
allowed
themselves
to
be
driven
back
step
by
step
the
guards
however
who
kept
them
back
had
to
be
doubled
for
they
were
fascinated
by
the
spot
and
continually
returned
thousands
of
people
were
hustling
each
other
along
the
road
they
were
running
up
from
all
the
settlements
and
even
from
montsou
and
the
man
above
on
the
the
fair
man
with
the
girlish
face
smoked
cigarettes
to
occupy
himself
keeping
his
clear
eyes
fixed
on
the
pit
then
the
wait
began
it
was
midday
no
one
had
eaten
but
no
one
moved
away
in
the
misty
sky
of
a
dirty
grey
colour
rusty
clouds
were
slowly
passing
by
a
big
dog
behind
rasseneur
hedge
was
barking
furiously
without
cessation
irritated
by
the
living
breath
of
the
crowd
and
the
crowd
had
gradually
spread
over
the
neighbouring
ground
forming
a
circle
at
a
hundred
metres
round
the
pit
the
voreux
arose
in
the
centre
of
the
great
space
there
was
not
a
soul
there
not
a
sound
it
was
a
desert
the
windows
and
the
doors
left
open
showed
the
abandonment
within
a
forgotten
ginger
cat
divining
the
peril
in
this
solitude
jumped
from
a
staircase
and
disappeared
no
doubt
the
stoves
of
the
boilers
were
scarcely
extinguished
for
the
tall
brick
chimney
gave
out
a
light
smoke
beneath
the
dark
clouds
while
the
weathercock
on
the
steeple
creaked
in
the
wind
with
a
short
shrill
cry
the
only
melancholy
voice
of
these
vast
buildings
which
were
about
to
die
at
two
nothing
had
moved
hennebeau
négrel
and
other
engineers
who
had
hastened
up
formed
a
group
in
black
coats
and
hats
standing
in
front
of
the
crowd
and
they
too
did
not
move
away
though
their
legs
were
aching
with
fatigue
and
they
were
feverish
and
ill
at
their
impotence
in
the
face
of
such
a
disaster
only
whispering
occasional
words
as
though
at
a
dying
person
bedside
the
upper
tubbing
must
nearly
all
have
fallen
in
for
sudden
echoing
sounds
could
be
heard
as
of
deep
broken
falls
succeeded
by
silence
the
wound
was
constantly
enlarging
the
landslip
which
had
begun
below
was
rising
and
approaching
the
surface
négrel
was
seized
by
nervous
impatience
he
wanted
to
see
and
he
was
already
advancing
alone
into
this
awful
void
when
he
was
seized
by
the
shoulders
what
was
the
good
he
could
prevent
nothing
an
old
miner
however
circumventing
the
overseers
rushed
into
the
shed
but
he
quietly
reappeared
he
had
gone
for
his
sabots
three
struck
still
nothing
a
falling
shower
had
soaked
the
crowd
but
they
had
not
withdrawn
a
step
rasseneur
dog
had
begun
to
bark
again
and
it
was
at
twenty
minutes
past
three
only
that
the
first
shock
was
felt
the
voreux
trembled
but
continued
solid
and
upright
then
a
second
shock
followed
immediately
and
a
long
cry
came
from
open
mouths
the
tarred
after
having
tottered
twice
had
fallen
down
with
a
terrible
crash
beneath
the
enormous
pressure
the
structures
broke
and
jarred
each
other
so
powerfully
that
sparks
leapt
out
from
this
moment
the
earth
continued
to
tremble
the
shocks
succeeded
one
another
subterranean
downfalls
the
rumbling
of
a
volcano
in
eruption
afar
the
dog
was
no
longer
barking
but
he
howled
plaintively
as
though
announcing
the
oscillations
which
he
felt
coming
and
the
women
the
children
all
these
people
who
were
looking
on
could
not
keep
back
a
clamour
of
distress
at
each
of
these
blows
which
shook
them
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
slate
roof
of
the
steeple
fell
in
the
and
the
were
split
open
leaving
a
considerable
breach
then
the
sounds
ceased
the
downfall
stopped
and
there
was
again
deep
silence
for
an
hour
the
voreux
remained
thus
broken
into
as
though
bombarded
by
an
army
of
barbarians
there
was
no
more
crying
out
the
enlarged
circle
of
spectators
merely
looked
on
beneath
the
beams
of
the
fractured
tipping
cradles
could
be
made
out
with
broken
and
twisted
hoppers
but
the
rubbish
had
especially
accumulated
at
the
where
there
had
been
a
rain
of
bricks
and
large
portions
of
wall
and
masses
of
plaster
had
fallen
in
the
iron
scaffold
which
bore
the
pulleys
had
bent
in
the
pit
a
cage
was
still
suspended
a
torn
was
hanging
then
there
was
a
hash
of
trams
metal
plates
and
ladders
by
some
chance
the
lamp
cabin
remained
standing
exhibiting
on
the
left
its
bright
rows
of
little
lamps
and
at
the
end
of
its
disembowelled
chamber
the
engine
could
be
seen
seated
squarely
on
its
massive
foundation
of
masonry
its
copper
was
shining
and
its
huge
steel
limbs
seemed
to
possess
indestructible
muscles
the
enormous
crank
bent
in
the
air
looked
like
the
powerful
knee
of
some
giant
quietly
reposing
in
his
strength
after
this
hour
of
respite
hennebeau
hopes
began
to
rise
the
movement
of
the
soil
must
have
come
to
an
end
and
there
would
be
some
chance
of
saving
the
engine
and
the
remainder
of
the
buildings
but
he
would
not
yet
allow
any
one
to
approach
considering
another
patience
desirable
this
waiting
became
unbearable
the
hope
increased
the
anguish
and
all
hearts
were
beating
quickly
a
dark
cloud
growing
large
at
the
horizon
hastened
the
twilight
a
sinister
dayfall
over
this
wreck
of
earth
tempests
since
seven
they
had
been
there
without
moving
or
eating
and
suddenly
as
the
engineers
were
cautiously
advancing
a
supreme
convulsion
of
the
soil
put
them
to
flight
subterranean
detonations
broke
out
a
whole
monstrous
artillery
was
cannonading
in
the
gulf
at
the
surface
the
last
buildings
were
tipped
over
and
crushed
at
first
a
sort
of
whirlpool
carried
away
the
rubbish
from
the
and
the
next
the
boiler
building
burst
and
disappeared
then
it
was
the
low
square
tower
where
the
was
groaning
which
fell
on
its
face
like
a
man
mown
down
by
a
bullet
and
then
a
terrible
thing
was
seen
the
engine
dislocated
from
its
massive
foundation
with
broken
limbs
was
struggling
against
death
it
moved
it
straightened
its
crank
its
giant
knee
as
though
to
rise
but
crushed
and
swallowed
up
it
was
dying
the
chimney
alone
thirty
metres
high
still
remained
standing
though
shaken
like
a
mast
in
the
tempest
it
was
thought
that
it
would
be
crushed
to
fragments
and
fly
to
powder
when
suddenly
it
sank
in
one
block
drunk
down
by
the
earth
melted
like
a
colossal
candle
and
nothing
was
left
not
even
the
point
of
the
lightning
conductor
it
was
done
for
the
evil
beast
crouching
in
this
hole
gorged
with
human
flesh
was
no
longer
breathing
with
its
thick
long
respiration
the
voreux
had
been
swallowed
whole
by
the
abyss
the
crowd
rushed
away
yelling
the
women
hid
their
eyes
as
they
ran
terror
drove
the
men
along
like
a
pile
of
dry
leaves
they
wished
not
to
shout
and
they
shouted
with
swollen
breasts
and
arms
in
the
air
before
the
immense
hole
which
had
been
hollowed
out
this
crater
as
of
an
extinct
volcano
fifteen
metres
deep
extended
from
the
road
to
the
canal
for
a
space
of
at
least
forty
metres
the
whole
square
of
the
mine
had
followed
the
buildings
the
gigantic
platforms
the
with
their
rails
a
complete
train
of
trams
three
wagons
without
counting
the
wood
supply
a
forest
of
cut
timber
gulped
down
like
straw
at
the
bottom
it
was
only
possible
to
distinguish
a
confused
mass
of
beams
bricks
iron
plaster
frightful
remains
piled
up
entangled
soiled
in
the
fury
of
the
catastrophe
and
the
hole
became
larger
cracks
started
from
the
edges
reaching
afar
across
the
fields
a
fissure
ascended
as
far
as
rasseneur
bar
and
his
front
wall
had
cracked
would
the
settlement
itself
pass
into
it
how
far
ought
they
to
flee
to
reach
shelter
at
the
end
of
this
abominable
day
beneath
this
leaden
cloud
which
also
seemed
about
to
crush
the
earth
a
cry
of
pain
escaped
négrel
hennebeau
who
had
drawn
back
was
in
tears
the
disaster
was
not
complete
one
bank
of
the
canal
gave
way
and
the
canal
emptied
itself
like
one
bubbling
sheet
through
one
of
the
cracks
it
disappeared
there
falling
like
a
cataract
down
a
deep
valley
the
mine
drank
down
this
river
the
galleries
would
now
be
submerged
for
years
soon
the
crater
was
filled
and
a
lake
of
muddy
water
occupied
the
place
where
once
stood
the
voreux
like
one
of
those
lakes
beneath
which
sleep
accursed
towns
there
was
a
terrified
silence
and
nothing
now
could
be
heard
but
the
fall
of
this
water
rumbling
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
then
on
the
shaken
souvarine
rose
up
he
had
recognized
maheude
and
zacharie
sobbing
before
this
downfall
the
weight
of
which
was
so
heavy
on
the
heads
of
the
wretches
who
were
in
agony
beneath
and
he
threw
down
his
last
cigarette
he
went
away
without
looking
back
into
the
now
dark
night
afar
his
shadow
diminished
and
mingled
with
the
darkness
he
was
going
over
there
to
the
unknown
he
was
going
tranquilly
to
extermination
wherever
there
might
be
dynamite
to
blow
up
towns
and
men
he
will
be
there
without
doubt
when
the
middle
class
in
agony
shall
hear
the
pavement
of
the
streets
bursting
up
beneath
their
feet
chapter
iv
on
the
night
that
followed
the
collapse
of
the
voreux
hennebeau
started
for
paris
wishing
to
inform
the
directors
in
person
before
the
newspapers
published
the
news
and
when
he
returned
on
the
following
day
he
appeared
to
be
quite
calm
with
his
usual
correct
administrative
air
he
had
evidently
freed
himself
from
responsibility
he
did
not
appear
to
have
decreased
in
favour
on
the
contrary
the
decree
appointing
him
officer
of
the
legion
of
honour
was
signed
hours
afterwards
but
if
the
manager
remained
safe
the
company
was
tottering
beneath
the
terrible
blow
it
was
not
the
few
million
francs
that
had
been
lost
it
was
the
wound
in
the
flank
the
deep
incessant
fear
of
the
morrow
in
face
of
this
massacre
of
one
of
their
mines
the
company
was
so
impressed
that
once
more
it
felt
the
need
of
silence
what
was
the
good
of
stirring
up
this
abomination
if
the
villain
were
discovered
why
make
a
martyr
of
him
in
order
that
his
awful
heroism
might
turn
other
heads
and
give
birth
to
a
long
line
of
incendiaries
and
murderers
besides
the
real
culprit
was
not
suspected
the
company
came
to
think
that
there
was
an
army
of
accomplices
not
being
able
to
believe
that
a
single
man
could
have
had
courage
and
strength
for
such
a
task
and
it
was
precisely
this
thought
which
weighed
on
them
this
thought
of
an
threat
to
the
existence
of
their
mines
the
manager
had
received
orders
to
organize
a
vast
system
of
espionage
and
then
to
dismiss
quietly
one
by
one
the
dangerous
men
who
were
suspected
of
having
had
a
hand
in
the
crime
they
contented
themselves
with
this
method
of
purification
a
prudent
and
politic
method
there
was
only
one
immediate
dismissal
that
of
dansaert
the
head
captain
ever
since
the
scandal
at
pierronne
house
he
had
become
impossible
a
pretext
was
made
of
his
attitude
in
danger
the
cowardice
of
a
captain
abandoning
his
men
this
was
also
a
prudent
sop
thrown
to
the
miners
who
hated
him
among
the
public
however
many
rumours
had
circulated
and
the
directors
had
to
send
a
letter
of
correction
to
one
newspaper
contradicting
a
story
in
which
mention
was
made
of
a
barrel
of
powder
lighted
by
the
strikers
after
a
rapid
inquiry
the
government
inspector
had
concluded
that
there
had
been
a
natural
rupture
of
the
tubbing
occasioned
by
the
piling
up
of
the
soil
and
the
company
had
preferred
to
be
silent
and
to
accept
the
blame
of
a
lack
of
superintendence
in
the
paris
press
after
the
third
day
the
catastrophe
had
served
to
increase
the
stock
of
general
news
nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
men
perishing
at
the
bottom
of
the
mine
and
the
telegrams
published
every
morning
were
eagerly
read
at
montsou
people
grew
pale
and
speechless
at
the
very
name
of
the
voreux
and
a
legend
had
formed
which
made
the
boldest
tremble
as
they
whispered
it
the
whole
country
showed
great
pity
for
the
victims
visits
were
organized
to
the
destroyed
pit
and
whole
families
hastened
up
to
shudder
at
the
ruins
which
lay
so
heavily
over
the
heads
of
the
buried
wretches
deneulin
who
had
been
appointed
divisional
engineer
came
into
the
midst
of
the
disaster
on
beginning
his
duties
and
his
first
care
was
to
turn
the
canal
back
into
its
bed
for
this
torrent
increased
the
damage
every
hour
extensive
works
were
necessary
and
he
at
once
set
a
hundred
men
to
construct
a
dyke
twice
over
the
impetuosity
of
the
stream
carried
away
the
first
dams
now
pumps
were
set
up
and
a
furious
struggle
was
going
on
step
by
step
the
vanished
soil
was
being
violently
reconquered
but
the
rescue
of
the
engulfed
miners
was
a
still
more
absorbing
work
négrel
was
appointed
to
attempt
a
supreme
effort
and
arms
were
not
lacking
to
help
him
all
the
colliers
rushed
to
offer
themselves
in
an
outburst
of
brotherhood
they
forgot
the
strike
they
did
not
trouble
themselves
at
all
about
payment
they
might
get
nothing
they
only
asked
to
risk
their
lives
as
soon
as
there
were
mates
in
danger
of
death
they
were
all
there
with
their
tools
quivering
as
they
waited
to
know
where
they
ought
to
strike
many
of
them
sick
with
fright
after
the
accident
shaken
by
nervous
tremors
soaked
in
cold
sweats
and
the
prey
of
continual
nightmares
got
up
in
spite
of
everything
and
were
as
eager
as
any
in
their
desire
to
fight
against
the
earth
as
though
they
had
a
revenge
to
take
on
it
unfortunately
the
difficulty
began
when
the
question
arose
what
could
be
done
how
could
they
go
down
from
what
side
could
they
attack
the
rocks
négrel
opinion
was
that
not
one
of
the
unfortunate
people
was
alive
the
fifteen
had
surely
perished
drowned
or
suffocated
but
in
these
mine
catastrophes
the
rule
is
always
to
assume
that
buried
men
are
alive
and
he
acted
on
this
supposition
the
first
problem
which
he
proposed
to
himself
was
to
decide
where
they
could
have
taken
refuge
the
captains
and
old
miners
whom
he
consulted
were
agreed
on
one
point
in
the
face
of
the
rising
water
the
men
had
certainly
come
up
from
gallery
to
gallery
to
the
highest
cuttings
so
that
they
were
without
doubt
driven
to
the
end
of
some
upper
passages
this
agreed
with
father
mouque
information
and
his
confused
narrative
even
gave
reason
to
suppose
that
in
the
wild
flight
the
band
had
separated
into
smaller
groups
leaving
fugitives
on
the
road
at
every
level
but
the
captains
were
not
unanimous
when
the
discussion
of
possible
attempts
at
rescue
arose
as
the
passages
nearest
to
the
surface
were
a
hundred
and
fifty
metres
down
there
could
be
no
question
of
sinking
a
shaft
réquillart
remained
the
one
means
of
access
the
only
point
by
which
they
could
approach
the
worst
was
that
the
old
pit
now
also
inundated
no
longer
communicated
with
the
voreux
and
above
the
level
of
the
water
only
a
few
ends
of
galleries
belonging
to
the
first
level
were
left
free
the
pumping
process
would
require
years
and
the
best
plan
would
be
to
visit
these
galleries
and
ascertain
if
any
of
them
approached
the
submerged
passages
at
the
end
of
which
the
distressed
miners
were
suspected
to
be
before
logically
arriving
at
this
point
much
discussion
had
been
necessary
to
dispose
of
a
crowd
of
impracticable
plans
négrel
now
began
to
stir
up
the
dust
of
the
archives
he
discovered
the
old
plans
of
the
two
pits
studied
them
and
decided
on
the
points
at
which
their
investigations
ought
to
be
carried
on
gradually
this
hunt
excited
him
he
was
in
his
turn
seized
by
a
fever
of
devotion
in
spite
of
his
ironical
indifference
to
men
and
things
the
first
difficulty
was
in
going
down
at
réquillart
it
was
necessary
to
clear
out
the
rubbish
from
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
to
cut
down
the
mountain
ash
and
raze
the
sloes
and
the
hawthorns
they
had
also
to
repair
the
ladders
then
they
began
to
feel
around
the
engineer
having
gone
down
with
ten
workmen
made
them
strike
the
iron
of
their
tools
against
certain
parts
of
the
seam
which
he
pointed
out
to
them
and
in
deep
silence
they
each
placed
an
ear
to
the
coal
listening
for
any
distant
blows
to
reply
but
they
went
in
vain
through
every
practicable
gallery
no
echo
returned
to
them
their
embarrassment
increased
at
what
spot
should
they
cut
into
the
bed
towards
whom
should
they
go
since
no
once
appeared
to
be
there
they
persisted
in
seeking
however
notwithstanding
the
exhaustion
produced
by
their
growing
anxiety
on
the
first
day
maheude
came
in
the
morning
to
réquillart
she
sat
down
on
a
beam
in
front
of
the
shaft
and
did
not
stir
from
it
till
evening
when
a
man
came
up
she
rose
and
questioned
him
with
her
eyes
nothing
no
nothing
and
she
sat
down
again
and
waited
still
without
a
word
with
hard
fixed
face
jeanlin
also
seeing
that
his
den
was
invaded
prowled
around
with
the
frightened
air
of
a
beast
of
prey
whose
burrow
will
betray
his
booty
he
thought
of
the
little
soldier
lying
beneath
the
rocks
fearing
lest
they
should
trouble
his
sound
sleep
but
that
side
of
the
mine
was
beneath
the
water
and
besides
their
investigations
were
directed
more
to
the
left
in
the
west
gallery
at
first
philoméne
had
also
come
accompanying
zacharie
who
was
one
of
the
gang
then
she
became
wearied
at
catching
cold
without
need
or
result
and
went
back
to
the
settlement
dragging
through
her
days
a
limp
indifferent
woman
occupied
from
morning
to
night
in
coughing
zacharie
on
the
contrary
lived
for
nothing
else
he
would
have
devoured
the
soil
to
get
back
his
sister
at
night
he
shouted
out
that
he
saw
her
he
heard
her
very
lean
from
hunger
her
chest
sore
with
calling
for
help
twice
he
had
tried
to
dig
without
orders
saying
that
it
was
there
that
he
was
sure
of
it
the
engineer
would
not
let
him
go
down
any
more
and
he
would
not
go
away
from
the
pit
from
which
he
was
driven
off
he
could
not
even
sit
down
and
wait
near
his
mother
he
was
so
deeply
stirred
by
the
need
to
act
which
drove
him
constantly
on
it
was
the
third
day
négrel
in
despair
had
resolved
to
abandon
the
attempt
in
the
evening
at
midday
after
lunch
when
he
came
back
with
his
men
to
make
one
last
effort
he
was
surprised
to
see
zacharie
red
and
gesticulating
come
out
of
the
mine
shouting
she
there
she
replied
to
me
come
along
quickly
he
had
slid
down
the
ladders
in
spite
of
the
watchman
and
was
declaring
that
he
had
heard
hammering
over
there
in
the
first
passage
of
the
guillaume
seam
but
we
have
already
been
twice
in
that
direction
négrel
observed
sceptically
anyhow
we
go
and
see
maheude
had
risen
and
had
to
be
prevented
from
going
down
she
waited
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
shaft
gazing
down
into
the
darkness
of
the
hole
négrel
down
below
himself
struck
three
blows
at
long
intervals
he
then
applied
his
ear
to
the
coal
cautioning
the
workers
to
be
very
silent
not
a
sound
reached
him
and
he
shook
his
head
evidently
the
poor
lad
was
dreaming
in
a
fury
zacharie
struck
in
his
turn
and
listened
anew
with
bright
eyes
and
limbs
trembling
with
joy
then
the
other
workmen
tried
the
experiment
one
after
the
other
and
all
grew
animated
hearing
the
distant
reply
quite
clearly
the
engineer
was
astonished
he
again
applied
his
ear
and
was
at
last
able
to
catch
a
sound
of
aerial
softness
a
rhythmical
roll
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
the
cadence
beaten
by
the
miners
when
they
are
fighting
against
the
coal
in
the
midst
of
danger
the
coal
transmits
the
sound
with
crystalline
limpidity
for
a
very
great
distance
a
captain
who
was
there
estimated
that
the
thickness
of
the
block
which
separated
them
from
their
mates
could
not
be
less
than
fifty
metres
but
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
already
stretch
out
a
hand
to
them
and
general
gladness
broke
out
négrel
decided
to
begin
at
once
the
work
of
approach
when
zacharie
up
above
saw
maheude
again
they
embraced
each
other
it
wo
do
to
get
excited
pierronne
who
had
come
for
a
visit
of
inquisitiveness
was
cruel
enough
to
say
if
catherine
is
there
it
would
be
such
a
grief
afterwards
that
was
true
catherine
might
be
somewhere
else
just
leave
me
alone
will
you
damn
it
cried
zacharie
in
a
rage
she
there
i
know
it
maheude
sat
down
again
in
silence
with
motionless
face
continuing
to
wait
as
soon
as
the
story
was
spread
at
montsou
a
new
crowd
arrived
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
they
remained
there
all
the
same
and
had
to
be
kept
at
a
distance
down
below
the
work
went
on
day
and
night
for
fear
of
meeting
an
obstacle
the
engineer
had
had
three
descending
galleries
opened
in
the
seam
converging
to
the
point
where
the
enclosed
miners
were
supposed
to
be
only
one
pikeman
could
hew
at
the
coal
on
the
narrow
face
of
the
tube
he
was
relieved
every
two
hours
and
the
coal
piled
in
baskets
was
passed
up
from
hand
to
hand
by
a
chain
of
men
increased
as
the
hole
was
hollowed
out
the
work
at
first
proceeded
very
quickly
they
did
six
metres
a
day
zacharie
had
secured
a
place
among
the
workers
chosen
for
the
hewing
it
was
a
post
of
honour
which
was
disputed
over
and
he
became
furious
when
they
wished
to
relieve
him
after
his
regulation
two
hours
of
labour
he
robbed
his
mates
of
their
turn
and
refused
to
let
go
the
pick
his
gallery
was
soon
in
advance
of
the
others
he
fought
against
the
coal
so
fiercely
that
his
breath
could
be
heard
coming
from
the
tube
like
the
roar
of
a
forge
within
his
breast
when
he
came
out
black
and
muddy
dizzy
with
fatigue
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
had
to
be
wrapped
up
in
a
covering
then
still
tottering
he
plunged
back
again
and
the
struggle
began
anew
the
low
deep
blows
the
stifled
groans
the
victorious
fury
of
massacre
the
worst
was
that
the
coal
now
became
hard
he
twice
broke
his
tool
and
was
exasperated
that
he
could
not
get
on
so
fast
he
suffered
also
from
the
heat
which
increased
with
every
metre
of
advance
and
was
unbearable
at
the
end
of
this
narrow
hole
where
the
air
could
not
circulate
a
hand
ventilator
worked
well
but
aeration
was
so
inadequate
that
on
three
occasions
it
was
necessary
to
take
out
fainting
hewers
who
were
being
asphyxiated
négrel
lived
below
with
his
men
his
meals
were
sent
down
to
him
and
he
sometimes
slept
for
a
couple
of
hours
on
a
truss
of
straw
rolled
in
a
cloak
the
one
thing
that
kept
them
up
was
the
supplication
of
the
wretches
beyond
the
call
which
was
sounded
ever
more
distinctly
to
hasten
on
the
rescue
it
now
rang
very
clearly
with
a
musical
sonority
as
though
struck
on
the
plates
of
a
harmonica
it
led
them
on
they
advanced
to
this
crystalline
sound
as
men
advance
to
the
sound
of
cannon
in
battle
every
time
that
a
pikeman
was
relieved
négrel
went
down
and
struck
then
applied
his
ear
and
every
time
so
far
the
reply
had
come
rapid
and
urgent
he
had
no
doubt
remaining
they
were
advancing
in
the
right
direction
but
with
what
fatal
slowness
they
would
never
arrive
soon
enough
on
the
first
two
days
they
had
indeed
hewn
through
thirteen
metres
but
on
the
third
day
they
fell
to
five
and
then
on
the
fourth
to
three
the
coal
was
becoming
closer
and
harder
to
such
an
extent
that
they
now
with
difficulty
struck
through
two
metres
on
the
ninth
day
after
superhuman
efforts
they
had
advanced
metres
and
calculated
that
some
twenty
must
still
be
left
before
them
for
the
prisoners
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
day
twelve
times
over
had
they
passed
hours
without
bread
without
fire
in
that
icy
darkness
this
awful
idea
moistened
the
eyelids
and
stiffened
the
arm
of
the
workers
it
seemed
impossible
that
christians
could
live
longer
the
distant
blows
had
become
weaker
since
the
previous
day
and
every
moment
they
trembled
lest
they
should
stop
maheude
came
regularly
every
morning
to
sit
at
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
in
her
arms
she
brought
estelle
who
could
not
remain
alone
from
morning
to
night
hour
by
hour
she
followed
the
workers
sharing
their
hopes
and
fears
there
was
feverish
expectation
among
the
groups
standing
around
and
even
as
far
as
montsou
with
endless
discussion
every
heart
in
the
district
was
beating
down
there
beneath
the
earth
on
the
ninth
day
at
the
breakfast
hour
no
reply
came
from
zacharie
when
he
was
called
for
the
relay
he
was
like
a
madman
working
on
furiously
with
oaths
négrel
who
had
come
up
for
a
moment
was
not
there
to
make
him
obey
and
only
a
captain
and
three
miners
were
below
no
doubt
zacharie
infuriated
with
the
feeble
vacillating
light
which
delayed
his
work
committed
the
imprudence
of
opening
his
lamp
although
severe
orders
had
been
given
for
leakages
of
had
taken
place
and
the
gas
remained
in
enormous
masses
in
these
narrow
unventilated
passages
suddenly
a
roar
of
thunder
was
heard
and
a
spout
of
fire
darted
out
of
the
tube
as
from
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
charged
with
grapeshot
everything
flamed
up
and
the
air
caught
fire
like
powder
from
one
end
of
the
galleries
to
the
other
this
torrent
of
flame
carried
away
the
captain
and
three
workers
ascended
the
pit
and
leapt
up
to
the
daylight
in
an
eruption
which
split
the
rocks
and
the
ruins
around
the
inquisitive
fled
and
maheude
arose
pressing
the
frightened
estelle
to
her
breast
when
négrel
and
the
men
came
back
they
were
seized
by
a
terrible
rage
they
struck
their
heels
on
the
earth
as
on
a
stepmother
who
was
killing
her
children
at
random
in
the
imbecile
whims
of
her
cruelty
they
were
devoting
themselves
they
were
coming
to
the
help
of
their
mates
and
still
they
must
lose
some
of
their
men
after
three
long
hours
of
effort
and
danger
they
reached
the
galleries
once
more
and
the
melancholy
ascent
of
the
victims
took
place
neither
the
captain
nor
the
workers
were
dead
but
they
were
covered
by
awful
wounds
which
gave
out
an
odour
of
grilled
flesh
they
had
drunk
of
fire
the
burns
had
got
into
their
throats
and
they
constantly
moaned
and
prayed
to
be
finished
off
one
of
the
three
miners
was
the
man
who
had
smashed
the
pump
at
with
a
final
blow
of
the
shovel
during
the
strike
the
two
others
still
had
scars
on
their
hands
and
grazed
torn
fingers
from
the
energy
with
which
they
had
thrown
bricks
at
the
soldiers
the
pale
and
shuddering
crowd
took
off
their
hats
when
they
were
carried
by
maheude
stood
waiting
zacharie
body
at
last
appeared
the
clothes
were
burnt
the
body
was
nothing
but
black
charcoal
calcined
and
unrecognizable
the
head
had
been
smashed
by
the
explosion
and
no
longer
existed
and
when
these
awful
remains
were
placed
on
a
stretcher
maheude
followed
them
mechanically
her
burning
eyelids
without
a
tear
with
estelle
drowsily
lying
in
her
arms
she
went
along
a
tragic
figure
her
hair
lashed
by
the
wind
at
the
settlement
philoméne
seemed
stupid
her
eyes
were
turned
into
fountains
and
she
was
quickly
relieved
but
the
mother
had
already
returned
with
the
same
step
to
réquillart
she
had
accompanied
her
son
she
was
returning
to
wait
for
her
daughter
three
more
days
passed
by
the
rescue
work
had
been
resumed
amid
incredible
difficulties
the
galleries
of
approach
had
fortunately
not
fallen
after
the
explosion
but
the
air
was
so
heavy
and
so
vitiated
that
more
ventilators
had
to
be
installed
every
twenty
minutes
the
pikemen
relieved
one
another
they
were
advancing
scarcely
two
metres
separated
them
from
their
mates
but
now
they
worked
feeling
cold
at
their
hearts
striking
hard
only
out
of
vengeance
for
the
noises
had
ceased
and
the
low
clear
cadence
of
the
call
no
longer
sounded
it
was
the
twelfth
day
of
their
labours
the
fifteenth
since
the
catastrophe
and
since
the
morning
there
had
been
a
silence
the
new
accident
increased
the
curiosity
at
montsou
and
the
inhabitants
organized
excursions
with
such
spirit
that
the
grégoires
decided
to
follow
the
fashion
they
arranged
a
party
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
go
to
the
voreux
in
their
carriage
while
madame
hennebeau
took
lucie
and
jeanne
there
in
hers
deneulin
would
show
them
over
his
yards
and
then
they
would
return
by
réquillart
where
négrel
would
tell
them
the
exact
state
of
things
in
the
galleries
and
if
there
was
still
hope
finally
they
would
dine
together
in
the
evening
when
the
grégoires
and
their
daughter
cécile
arrived
at
the
ruined
mine
toward
three
they
found
madame
hennebeau
already
there
in
a
dress
protecting
herself
under
her
parasol
from
the
pale
february
sun
the
warmth
of
spring
was
in
the
clear
sky
hennebeau
was
there
with
deneulin
and
she
was
listening
with
listless
ear
to
the
account
which
the
latter
gave
her
of
the
efforts
which
had
been
made
to
dam
up
the
canal
jeanne
who
always
carried
a
with
her
began
to
draw
carried
away
by
the
horror
of
the
subject
while
lucie
seated
beside
her
on
the
remains
of
a
wagon
was
crying
out
with
pleasure
and
finding
it
awfully
jolly
the
incomplete
dam
allowed
numerous
leaks
and
frothy
streams
fell
in
a
cascade
down
the
enormous
hole
of
the
engulfed
mine
the
crater
was
being
emptied
however
and
the
water
drunk
by
the
earth
was
sinking
and
revealing
the
fearful
ruin
at
the
bottom
beneath
the
tender
azure
of
this
beautiful
day
there
lay
a
sewer
the
ruins
of
a
town
drowned
and
melted
in
mud
and
people
come
out
of
their
way
to
see
that
exclaimed
grégoire
disillusioned
cécile
rosy
with
health
and
glad
to
breathe
so
pure
an
air
was
cheerfully
joking
while
madame
hennebeau
made
a
little
grimace
of
repugnance
as
she
murmured
the
fact
is
this
is
not
pretty
at
all
the
two
engineers
laughed
they
tried
to
interest
the
visitors
taking
them
round
and
explaining
to
them
the
working
of
the
pumps
and
the
manipulation
of
the
stamper
which
drove
in
the
piles
but
the
ladies
became
anxious
they
shuddered
when
they
knew
that
the
pumps
would
have
to
work
for
six
or
seven
years
before
the
shaft
was
reconstructed
and
all
the
water
exhausted
from
the
mine
no
they
would
rather
think
of
something
else
this
destruction
was
only
good
to
give
bad
dreams
let
us
go
said
madame
hennebeau
turning
towards
her
carriage
lucie
and
jeanne
protested
what
so
soon
and
the
drawing
which
was
not
finished
they
wanted
to
remain
their
father
would
bring
them
to
dinner
in
the
evening
hennebeau
alone
took
his
place
with
his
wife
in
the
carriage
for
he
wished
to
question
négrel
very
well
go
on
before
said
grégoire
we
will
follow
you
we
have
a
little
visit
of
five
minutes
to
make
over
there
at
the
settlement
go
on
go
on
we
shall
be
at
réquillart
as
soon
as
you
he
got
up
behind
madame
grégoire
and
cécile
and
while
the
other
carriage
went
along
by
the
canal
theirs
gently
ascended
the
slope
their
excursion
was
to
be
completed
by
a
visit
of
charity
death
had
filled
them
with
pity
for
this
tragical
maheu
family
about
whom
the
whole
country
was
talking
they
had
no
pity
for
the
father
that
brigand
that
slayer
of
soldiers
who
had
to
be
struck
down
like
a
wolf
but
the
mother
touched
them
that
poor
woman
who
had
just
lost
her
son
after
having
lost
her
husband
and
whose
daughter
was
perhaps
a
corpse
beneath
the
earth
to
say
nothing
of
an
invalid
grandfather
a
child
who
was
lame
as
the
result
of
a
landslip
and
a
little
girl
who
died
of
starvation
during
the
strike
so
that
though
this
family
had
in
part
deserved
its
misfortunes
by
the
detestable
spirit
it
had
shown
they
had
resolved
to
assert
the
breadth
of
their
charity
their
desire
for
forgetfulness
and
conciliation
by
themselves
bringing
on
alms
two
parcels
carefully
wrapped
up
had
been
placed
beneath
a
seat
of
the
carriage
an
old
woman
pointed
out
to
the
coachman
maheude
house
no
in
the
second
block
but
when
the
grégoires
alighted
with
the
parcels
they
knocked
in
vain
at
last
they
struck
their
fists
against
the
door
still
without
reply
the
house
echoed
mournfully
like
a
house
emptied
by
grief
frozen
and
dark
long
since
abandoned
there
no
one
there
said
cécile
disappointed
what
a
nuisance
what
shall
we
do
with
all
this
suddenly
the
door
of
the
next
house
opened
and
the
levaque
woman
appeared
oh
sir
i
beg
pardon
excuse
me
miss
it
the
neighbour
that
you
want
she
not
there
she
at
réquillart
with
a
flow
of
words
she
told
them
the
story
repeating
to
them
that
people
must
help
one
another
and
that
she
was
keeping
lénore
and
henri
in
her
house
to
allow
the
mother
to
go
and
wait
over
there
her
eyes
had
fallen
on
the
parcels
and
she
began
to
talk
about
her
poor
daughter
who
had
become
a
widow
displaying
her
own
wretchedness
while
her
eyes
shone
with
covetousness
then
in
a
hesitating
way
she
muttered
i
got
the
key
if
the
lady
and
gentleman
would
really
like
the
grandfather
is
there
the
grégoires
looked
at
her
in
stupefaction
what
the
grandfather
was
there
but
no
one
had
replied
he
was
sleeping
then
and
when
the
levaque
made
up
her
mind
to
open
the
door
what
they
saw
stopped
them
on
the
threshold
bonnemort
was
there
alone
with
large
fixed
eyes
nailed
to
his
chair
in
front
of
the
cold
fireplace
around
him
the
room
appeared
larger
without
the
clock
or
the
polished
deal
furniture
which
formerly
animated
it
there
only
remained
against
the
green
crudity
of
the
walls
the
portraits
of
the
emperor
and
empress
whose
rosy
lips
were
smiling
with
official
benevolence
the
old
man
did
not
stir
nor
wink
his
eyelids
beneath
the
sudden
light
from
the
door
he
seemed
imbecile
as
though
he
had
not
seen
all
these
people
come
in
at
his
feet
lay
his
plate
garnished
with
ashes
such
as
is
placed
for
cats
for
ordure
do
mind
if
he
not
very
polite
said
the
levaque
woman
obligingly
seems
he
broken
something
in
his
brain
it
a
fortnight
since
he
left
off
speaking
but
bonnemort
was
shaken
by
some
agitation
a
deep
scraping
which
seemed
to
arise
from
his
belly
and
he
expectorated
into
the
plate
a
thick
black
expectoration
the
ashes
were
soaked
into
a
coaly
mud
all
the
coal
of
the
mine
which
he
drew
from
his
chest
he
had
already
resumed
his
immobility
he
stirred
no
more
except
at
intervals
to
spit
uneasy
and
with
stomachs
turned
the
grégoires
endeavoured
to
utter
a
few
friendly
and
encouraging
words
well
my
good
man
said
the
father
you
have
a
cold
then
the
old
man
with
his
eyes
to
the
wall
did
not
turn
his
head
and
a
heavy
silence
fell
once
more
they
ought
to
make
you
a
little
gruel
added
the
mother
he
preserved
his
mute
stiffness
i
say
papa
murmured
cécile
they
certainly
told
us
he
was
an
invalid
only
we
did
not
think
of
it
afterwards
she
interrupted
herself
much
embarrassed
after
having
placed
on
the
table
a
and
two
bottles
of
wine
she
undid
the
second
parcel
and
drew
from
it
a
pair
of
enormous
boots
it
was
the
present
intended
for
the
grandfather
and
she
held
one
boot
in
each
hand
in
confusion
contemplating
the
poor
man
swollen
feet
which
would
never
walk
again
eh
they
come
a
little
late
do
they
my
worthy
fellow
said
grégoire
again
to
enliven
the
situation
it
does
matter
always
useful
bonnemort
neither
heard
nor
replied
with
his
terrible
face
as
cold
and
as
hard
as
a
stone
then
cécile
furtively
placed
the
boots
against
the
wall
but
in
spite
of
her
precautions
the
nails
clanked
and
those
enormous
boots
stood
oppressively
in
the
room
he
wo
say
thank
you
said
the
levaque
woman
who
had
cast
a
look
of
deep
envy
on
the
boots
might
as
well
give
a
pair
of
spectacles
to
a
duck
asking
your
pardon
she
went
on
she
was
trying
to
draw
the
grégoires
into
her
own
house
where
she
hoped
to
gain
their
pity
at
last
she
thought
of
a
pretext
she
praised
henri
and
lénore
who
were
so
good
so
gentle
and
so
intelligent
answering
like
angels
the
questions
that
they
were
asked
they
would
tell
the
lady
and
gentleman
all
that
they
wished
to
know
will
you
come
for
a
moment
my
child
asked
the
father
glad
to
get
away
yes
i
follow
you
she
replied
cécile
remained
alone
with
bonnemort
what
kept
her
there
trembling
and
fascinated
was
the
thought
that
she
seemed
to
recognize
this
old
man
where
then
had
she
met
this
square
livid
face
tattooed
with
coal
suddenly
she
remembered
she
saw
again
a
mob
of
shouting
people
who
surrounded
her
and
she
felt
cold
hands
pressing
her
neck
it
was
he
she
saw
the
man
again
she
looked
at
his
hands
placed
on
his
knees
the
hands
of
an
invalid
workman
whose
whole
strength
is
in
his
wrists
still
firm
in
spite
of
age
gradually
bonnemort
seemed
to
awake
he
perceived
her
and
examined
her
in
his
turn
a
flame
mounted
to
his
cheeks
a
nervous
spasm
drew
his
mouth
from
which
flowed
a
thin
streak
of
black
saliva
fascinated
they
remained
opposite
each
other
she
flourishing
plump
and
fresh
from
the
long
idleness
and
sated
comfort
of
her
race
he
swollen
with
water
with
the
pitiful
ugliness
of
a
foundered
beast
destroyed
from
father
to
son
by
a
century
of
work
and
hunger
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
when
the
grégoires
surprised
at
not
seeing
cécile
came
back
into
the
maheus
house
they
uttered
a
terrible
cry
their
daughter
was
lying
on
the
ground
with
livid
face
strangled
at
her
neck
fingers
had
left
the
red
imprint
of
a
giant
hand
bonnemort
tottering
on
his
dead
legs
had
fallen
beside
her
without
power
to
rise
his
hands
were
still
hooked
and
he
looked
round
with
his
imbecile
air
and
large
open
eyes
in
his
fall
he
had
broken
his
plate
the
ashes
were
spread
round
the
mud
of
the
black
expectoration
had
stained
the
floor
while
the
great
pair
of
boots
safe
and
sound
stood
side
by
side
against
the
wall
it
was
never
possible
to
establish
the
exact
facts
why
had
cécile
come
near
how
could
bonnemort
nailed
to
his
chair
have
been
able
to
seize
her
throat
evidently
when
he
held
her
he
must
have
become
furious
constantly
pressing
overthrown
with
her
and
stifling
her
cries
to
the
last
groan
not
a
sound
not
a
moan
had
traversed
the
thin
partition
to
the
neighbouring
house
it
seemed
to
be
an
outbreak
of
sudden
madness
a
longing
to
murder
before
this
white
young
neck
such
savagery
was
stupefying
in
an
old
invalid
who
had
lived
like
a
worthy
man
an
obedient
brute
opposed
to
new
ideas
what
rancour
unknown
to
himself
by
some
slow
process
of
poisoning
had
risen
from
his
bowels
to
his
brain
the
horror
of
it
led
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
unconscious
that
it
was
the
crime
of
an
idiot
the
grégoires
meanwhile
on
their
knees
were
sobbing
choked
with
grief
their
idolized
daughter
that
daughter
desired
so
long
on
whom
they
had
lavished
all
their
goods
whom
they
used
to
watch
sleeping
on
tiptoe
whom
they
never
thought
sufficiently
well
nourished
never
sufficiently
plump
it
was
the
downfall
of
their
very
life
what
was
the
good
of
living
now
that
they
would
have
to
live
without
her
the
levaque
woman
in
distraction
cried
ah
the
old
beggar
what
he
done
there
who
would
have
expected
such
a
thing
and
maheude
who
wo
come
back
till
evening
shall
i
go
and
fetch
her
the
father
and
mother
were
crushed
and
did
not
reply
eh
it
will
be
better
i
go
but
before
going
the
levaque
woman
looked
at
the
boots
the
whole
settlement
was
excited
and
a
crowd
was
already
hustling
around
perhaps
they
would
get
stolen
and
then
the
maheus
had
no
man
now
to
put
them
on
she
quietly
carried
them
away
they
would
just
fit
bouteloup
feet
at
réquillart
the
hennebeaus
with
négrel
waited
a
long
time
for
the
grégoires
négrel
who
had
come
up
from
the
pit
gave
details
they
hoped
to
communicate
that
very
evening
with
the
prisoners
but
they
would
certainly
find
nothing
but
corpses
for
the
silence
continued
behind
the
engineer
maheude
seated
on
the
beam
was
listening
with
white
face
when
the
levaque
woman
came
up
and
told
her
the
old
man
strange
deed
and
she
only
made
a
sweeping
gesture
of
impatience
and
irritation
she
followed
her
however
madame
hennebeau
was
much
affected
what
an
abomination
that
poor
cécile
so
merry
that
very
day
so
full
of
life
an
hour
before
hennebeau
had
to
lead
his
wife
for
a
moment
into
old
mouque
hovel
with
his
awkward
hands
he
unfastened
her
dress
troubled
by
the
odour
of
musk
which
her
open
bodice
exhaled
and
as
with
streaming
tears
she
clasped
négrel
terrified
at
this
death
which
cut
short
the
marriage
the
husband
watched
them
lamenting
together
and
was
delivered
from
one
anxiety
this
misfortune
would
arrange
everything
he
preferred
to
keep
his
nephew
for
fear
of
his
coachman
chapter
v
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
the
abandoned
wretches
were
yelling
with
terror
the
water
now
came
up
to
their
hips
the
noise
of
the
torrent
dazed
them
the
final
falling
in
of
the
tubbing
sounded
like
the
last
crack
of
doom
and
their
bewilderment
was
completed
by
the
neighing
of
the
horses
shut
up
in
the
stable
the
terrible
unforgettable
of
an
animal
that
is
being
slaughtered
mouque
had
let
go
bataille
the
old
horse
was
there
trembling
with
its
dilated
eye
fixed
on
this
water
which
was
constantly
rising
the
was
rapidly
filling
the
greenish
flood
slowly
enlarged
under
the
red
gleam
of
the
three
lamps
which
were
still
burning
under
the
roof
and
suddenly
when
he
felt
this
ice
soaking
his
coat
he
set
out
in
a
furious
gallop
and
was
engulfed
and
lost
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
haulage
galleries
then
there
was
a
general
rush
the
men
following
the
beast
nothing
more
to
be
done
in
this
damned
hole
shouted
mouque
we
must
try
at
réquillart
the
idea
that
they
might
get
out
by
the
old
neighbouring
pit
if
they
arrived
before
the
passage
was
cut
off
now
carried
them
away
the
twenty
hustled
one
another
as
they
went
in
single
file
holding
their
lamps
in
the
air
so
that
the
water
should
not
extinguish
them
fortunately
the
gallery
rose
with
an
imperceptible
slope
and
they
proceeded
for
two
hundred
metres
struggling
against
the
flood
which
was
not
now
gaining
on
them
sleeping
beliefs
reawakened
in
these
distracted
souls
they
invoked
the
earth
for
it
was
the
earth
that
was
avenging
herself
discharging
the
blood
from
the
vein
because
they
had
cut
one
of
her
arteries
an
old
man
stammered
forgotten
prayers
bending
his
thumbs
backwards
to
appease
the
evil
spirits
of
the
mine
but
at
the
first
turning
disagreement
broke
out
the
groom
proposed
turning
to
the
left
others
declared
that
they
could
make
a
short
cut
by
going
to
the
right
a
minute
was
lost
well
die
there
what
the
devil
does
it
matter
to
me
chaval
brutally
exclaimed
i
go
this
way
he
turned
to
the
right
and
two
mates
followed
him
the
others
continued
to
rush
behind
father
mouque
who
had
grown
up
at
the
bottom
of
réquillart
he
himself
hesitated
however
not
knowing
where
to
turn
they
lost
their
heads
even
the
old
men
could
no
longer
recognize
the
passages
which
lay
like
a
tangled
skein
before
them
at
every
bifurcation
they
were
pulled
up
short
by
uncertainty
and
yet
they
had
to
decide
étienne
was
running
last
delayed
by
catherine
who
was
paralysed
by
fatigue
and
fear
he
would
have
gone
to
the
right
with
chaval
for
he
thought
that
the
better
road
but
he
had
not
preferring
to
part
from
chaval
the
rush
continued
however
some
of
the
mates
had
gone
from
their
side
and
only
seven
were
left
behind
old
mouque
hang
on
to
my
neck
and
i
will
carry
you
said
étienne
to
the
young
girl
seeing
her
grow
weak
no
let
me
be
she
murmured
i
ca
do
more
i
would
rather
die
at
once
they
delayed
and
were
left
fifty
metres
behind
he
was
lifting
her
in
spite
of
her
resistance
when
the
gallery
was
suddenly
stopped
up
an
enormous
block
fell
in
and
separated
them
from
the
others
the
inundation
was
already
soaking
the
soil
which
was
shifting
on
every
side
they
had
to
retrace
their
steps
then
they
no
longer
knew
in
what
direction
they
were
going
there
was
an
end
of
all
hope
of
escaping
by
réquillart
their
only
remaining
hope
was
to
gain
the
upper
workings
from
which
they
might
perhaps
be
delivered
if
the
water
sank
étienne
at
last
recognized
the
guillaume
seam
good
he
exclaimed
now
i
know
where
we
are
by
god
we
were
in
the
right
road
but
we
may
go
to
the
devil
now
here
let
us
go
straight
on
we
will
climb
up
the
passage
the
flood
was
beating
against
their
breasts
and
they
walked
very
slowly
as
long
as
they
had
light
they
did
not
despair
and
they
blew
out
one
of
the
lamps
to
economize
the
oil
meaning
to
empty
it
into
the
other
lamp
they
had
reached
the
chimney
passage
when
a
noise
behind
made
them
turn
was
it
some
mates
then
who
had
also
found
the
road
barred
and
were
returning
a
roaring
sound
came
from
afar
they
could
not
understand
this
tempest
which
approached
them
spattering
foam
and
they
cried
out
when
they
saw
a
gigantic
whitish
mass
coming
out
of
the
shadow
and
trying
to
rejoin
them
between
the
narrow
timbering
in
which
it
was
being
crushed
it
was
bataille
on
leaving
the
he
had
wildly
galloped
along
the
dark
galleries
he
seemed
to
know
his
road
in
this
subterranean
town
which
he
had
inhabited
for
eleven
years
and
his
eyes
saw
clearly
in
the
depths
of
the
eternal
night
in
which
he
had
lived
he
galloped
on
and
on
bending
his
head
drawing
up
his
feet
passing
through
these
narrow
tubes
in
the
earth
filled
by
his
great
body
road
succeeded
to
road
and
the
forked
turnings
were
passed
without
any
hesitation
where
was
he
going
over
there
perhaps
towards
that
vision
of
his
youth
to
the
mill
where
he
had
been
born
on
the
bank
of
the
scarpe
to
the
confused
recollection
of
the
sun
burning
in
the
air
like
a
great
lamp
he
desired
to
live
his
beast
memory
awoke
the
longing
to
breathe
once
more
the
air
of
the
plains
drove
him
straight
onwards
to
the
discovery
of
that
hole
the
exit
beneath
the
warm
sun
into
light
rebellion
carried
away
his
ancient
resignation
this
pit
was
murdering
him
after
having
blinded
him
the
water
which
pursued
him
was
lashing
him
on
the
flanks
and
biting
him
on
the
crupper
but
as
he
went
deeper
in
the
galleries
became
narrower
the
roofs
lower
and
the
walls
protruded
he
galloped
on
in
spite
of
everything
grazing
himself
leaving
shreds
of
his
limbs
on
the
timber
from
every
side
the
mine
seemed
to
be
pressing
on
to
him
to
take
him
and
to
stifle
him
then
étienne
and
catherine
as
he
came
near
them
perceived
that
he
was
strangling
between
the
rocks
he
had
stumbled
and
broken
his
two
front
legs
with
a
last
effort
he
dragged
himself
a
few
metres
but
his
flanks
could
not
pass
he
remained
hemmed
in
and
garrotted
by
the
earth
with
his
bleeding
head
stretched
out
he
still
sought
for
some
crack
with
his
great
troubled
eyes
the
water
was
rapidly
covering
him
he
began
to
neigh
with
that
terrible
prolonged
with
which
the
other
horses
had
already
died
in
the
stable
it
was
a
sight
of
fearful
agony
this
old
beast
shattered
and
motionless
struggling
at
this
depth
far
from
the
daylight
the
flood
was
drowning
his
mane
and
his
cry
of
distress
never
ceased
he
uttered
it
more
hoarsely
with
his
large
open
mouth
stretched
out
there
was
a
last
rumble
the
hollow
sound
of
a
cask
which
is
being
filled
then
deep
silence
fell
oh
my
god
take
me
away
catherine
sobbed
ah
my
god
i
afraid
i
do
want
to
die
take
me
away
take
me
away
she
had
seen
death
the
fallen
shaft
the
inundated
mine
nothing
had
seized
her
with
such
terror
as
this
clamour
of
bataille
in
agony
and
she
constantly
heard
it
her
ears
were
ringing
with
it
all
her
flesh
was
shuddering
with
it
take
me
away
take
me
away
étienne
had
seized
her
and
lifted
her
it
was
indeed
time
they
ascended
the
chimney
passage
soaked
to
the
shoulders
he
was
obliged
to
help
her
for
she
had
no
strength
to
cling
to
the
timber
three
times
over
he
thought
that
she
was
slipping
from
him
and
falling
back
into
that
deep
sea
of
which
the
tide
was
roaring
beneath
them
however
they
were
able
to
breathe
for
a
few
minutes
when
they
reached
the
first
gallery
which
was
still
free
the
water
reappeared
and
they
had
to
hoist
themselves
up
again
and
for
hours
this
ascent
continued
the
flood
chasing
them
from
passage
to
passage
and
constantly
forcing
them
to
ascend
at
the
sixth
level
a
respite
rendered
them
feverish
with
hope
and
it
seemed
that
the
waters
were
becoming
stationary
but
a
more
rapid
rise
took
place
and
they
had
to
climb
to
the
seventh
and
then
to
the
eighth
level
only
one
remained
and
when
they
had
reached
it
they
anxiously
watched
each
centimetre
by
which
the
water
gained
on
them
if
it
did
not
stop
they
would
then
die
like
the
old
horse
crushed
against
the
roof
and
their
chests
filled
by
the
flood
landslips
echoed
every
moment
the
whole
mine
was
shaken
and
its
distended
bowels
burst
with
the
enormous
flood
which
gorged
them
at
the
end
of
the
galleries
the
air
driven
back
pressed
together
and
crushed
exploded
terribly
amid
split
rocks
and
overthrown
soil
it
was
a
terrifying
uproar
of
interior
cataclysms
a
remnant
of
the
ancient
battle
when
deluges
overthrew
the
earth
burying
the
mountains
beneath
the
plains
and
catherine
shaken
and
dazed
by
this
continuous
downfall
joined
her
hands
stammering
the
same
words
without
cessation
i
do
want
to
die
i
do
want
to
die
to
reassure
her
étienne
declared
that
the
water
was
not
now
moving
their
flight
had
lasted
for
fully
six
hours
and
they
would
soon
be
rescued
he
said
six
hours
without
knowing
for
they
had
lost
all
count
of
time
in
reality
a
whole
day
had
already
passed
in
their
climb
up
through
the
guillaume
seam
drenched
and
shivering
they
settled
themselves
down
she
undressed
herself
without
shame
and
wrung
out
her
clothes
then
she
put
on
again
the
jacket
and
breeches
and
let
them
finish
drying
on
her
as
her
feet
were
bare
he
made
her
take
his
own
sabots
they
could
wait
patiently
now
they
had
lowered
the
wick
of
the
lamp
leaving
only
the
feeble
gleam
of
a
but
their
stomachs
were
torn
by
cramp
and
they
both
realized
that
they
were
dying
of
hunger
up
till
now
they
had
not
felt
that
they
were
living
the
catastrophe
had
occurred
before
breakfast
and
now
they
found
their
swollen
by
the
water
and
changed
into
sop
she
had
to
become
angry
before
he
would
accept
his
share
as
soon
as
she
had
eaten
she
fell
asleep
from
weariness
on
the
cold
earth
he
was
devoured
by
insomnia
and
watched
over
her
with
fixed
eyes
and
forehead
between
his
hands
how
many
hours
passed
by
thus
he
would
have
been
unable
to
say
all
that
he
knew
was
that
before
him
through
the
hole
they
had
ascended
he
had
seen
the
flood
reappear
black
and
moving
the
beast
whose
back
was
ceaselessly
swelling
out
to
reach
them
at
first
it
was
only
a
thin
line
a
supple
serpent
stretching
itself
out
then
it
enlarged
into
a
crawling
crouching
flank
and
soon
it
reached
them
and
the
sleeping
girl
feet
were
touched
by
it
in
his
anxiety
he
yet
hesitated
to
wake
her
was
it
not
cruel
to
snatch
her
from
this
repose
of
unconscious
ignorance
which
was
perhaps
lulling
her
with
a
dream
of
the
open
air
and
of
life
beneath
the
sun
besides
where
could
they
fly
and
he
thought
and
remembered
that
the
upbrow
established
at
this
part
of
the
seam
communicated
end
to
end
with
that
which
served
the
upper
level
that
would
be
a
way
out
he
let
her
sleep
as
long
as
possible
watching
the
flood
gain
on
them
waiting
for
it
to
chase
them
away
at
last
he
lifted
her
gently
and
a
great
shudder
passed
over
her
ah
my
god
it
true
it
beginning
again
my
god
she
remembered
she
cried
out
again
finding
death
so
near
no
calm
yourself
he
whispered
we
can
pass
upon
my
word
to
reach
the
upbrow
they
had
to
walk
doubled
up
again
wetted
to
the
shoulders
and
the
climbing
began
anew
now
more
dangerous
through
this
hole
entirely
of
timber
a
hundred
metres
long
at
first
they
wished
to
pull
the
cable
so
as
to
fix
one
of
the
carts
at
the
bottom
for
if
the
other
should
come
down
during
their
ascent
they
would
be
crushed
but
nothing
moved
some
obstacle
interfered
with
the
mechanism
they
ventured
in
not
daring
to
make
use
of
the
cable
which
was
in
their
way
and
tearing
their
nails
against
the
smooth
framework
he
came
behind
supporting
her
by
his
head
when
she
slipped
with
torn
hands
suddenly
they
came
across
the
splinters
of
a
beam
which
barred
the
way
a
portion
of
the
soil
had
fallen
down
and
prevented
them
from
going
any
higher
fortunately
a
door
opened
here
and
they
passed
into
a
passage
they
were
stupefied
to
see
the
flicker
of
a
lamp
in
front
of
them
a
man
cried
wildly
to
them
more
clever
people
as
big
fools
as
i
am
they
recognized
chaval
who
had
found
himself
blocked
by
the
landslip
which
filled
the
upbrow
his
two
mates
who
had
set
out
with
him
had
been
left
on
the
way
with
fractured
skulls
he
was
wounded
in
the
elbow
but
had
had
the
courage
to
go
back
on
his
knees
take
their
lamps
and
search
them
to
steal
their
as
he
escaped
a
final
downfall
behind
his
back
had
closed
the
gallery
he
immediately
swore
that
he
would
not
share
his
victuals
with
these
people
who
came
up
out
of
the
earth
he
would
sooner
knock
their
brains
out
then
he
too
recognized
them
his
anger
fell
and
he
began
to
laugh
with
a
laugh
of
evil
joy
ah
it
you
catherine
you
broken
your
nose
and
you
want
to
join
your
man
again
well
well
we
play
out
the
game
together
he
pretended
not
to
see
étienne
the
latter
overwhelmed
by
this
encounter
made
a
gesture
as
though
to
protect
the
putter
who
was
pressing
herself
against
him
he
must
however
accept
the
situation
speaking
as
though
they
had
left
each
other
good
friends
an
hour
before
he
simply
asked
have
you
looked
down
below
we
ca
pass
through
the
cuttings
then
chaval
still
grinned
ah
bosh
the
cuttings
they
fallen
in
too
we
are
between
two
walls
a
real
mousetrap
but
you
can
go
back
by
the
brow
if
you
are
a
good
diver
the
water
in
fact
was
rising
they
could
hear
it
rippling
their
retreat
was
already
cut
off
and
he
was
right
it
was
a
mousetrap
a
obstructed
before
and
behind
by
considerable
falls
of
earth
there
was
not
one
issue
all
three
were
walled
up
then
you
stay
chaval
added
jeeringly
well
it
the
best
you
can
do
and
if
you
just
leave
me
alone
i
sha
even
speak
to
you
there
still
room
here
for
two
men
we
shall
soon
see
which
will
die
first
provided
they
do
come
to
us
which
seems
a
tough
job
the
young
man
said
if
we
were
to
hammer
they
would
hear
us
perhaps
i
tired
of
hammering
here
try
yourself
with
this
stone
étienne
picked
up
the
fragment
of
sandstone
which
the
other
had
already
broken
off
and
against
the
seam
at
the
end
he
struck
the
miner
call
the
prolonged
roll
by
which
workmen
in
peril
signal
their
presence
then
he
placed
his
ear
to
listen
twenty
times
over
he
persisted
no
sound
replied
during
this
time
chaval
affected
to
be
coolly
attending
to
his
little
household
first
he
arranged
the
three
lamps
against
the
wall
only
one
was
burning
the
others
could
be
used
later
on
afterwards
he
placed
on
a
piece
of
timber
the
two
slices
of
which
were
still
left
that
was
the
sideboard
he
could
last
quite
two
days
with
that
if
he
were
careful
he
turned
round
saying
you
know
catherine
there
will
be
half
for
you
when
you
are
famished
the
young
girl
was
silent
it
completed
her
unhappiness
to
find
herself
again
between
these
two
men
and
their
awful
life
began
neither
chaval
nor
étienne
opened
their
mouths
seated
on
the
earth
a
few
paces
from
each
other
at
a
hint
from
the
former
the
latter
extinguished
his
lamp
a
piece
of
useless
luxury
then
they
sank
back
into
silence
catherine
was
lying
down
near
étienne
restless
under
the
glances
of
her
former
lover
the
hours
passed
by
they
heard
the
low
murmur
of
the
water
for
ever
rising
while
from
time
to
time
deep
shocks
and
distant
echoes
announced
the
final
settling
down
of
the
mine
when
the
lamp
was
empty
and
they
had
to
open
another
to
light
it
they
were
for
a
moment
disturbed
by
the
fear
of
but
they
would
rather
have
been
blown
up
at
once
than
live
on
in
darkness
nothing
exploded
however
there
was
no
they
stretched
themselves
out
again
and
the
hours
continued
to
pass
by
a
noise
aroused
étienne
and
catherine
and
they
raised
their
heads
chaval
had
decided
to
eat
he
had
cut
off
half
a
slice
of
and
was
chewing
it
slowly
to
avoid
the
temptation
of
swallowing
it
all
they
gazed
at
him
tortured
by
hunger
well
do
you
refuse
he
said
to
the
putter
in
his
provoking
way
you
wrong
she
had
lowered
her
eyes
fearing
to
yield
her
stomach
was
torn
by
such
cramps
that
tears
were
swelling
beneath
her
eyelids
but
she
understood
what
he
was
asking
in
the
morning
he
had
breathed
over
her
neck
he
was
seized
again
by
one
of
his
old
furies
of
desire
on
seeing
her
near
the
other
man
the
glances
with
which
he
called
her
had
a
flame
in
them
which
she
knew
well
the
flame
of
his
crises
of
jealousy
when
he
would
fall
on
her
with
his
fists
accusing
her
of
committing
abominations
with
her
mother
lodger
and
she
was
not
willing
she
trembled
lest
by
returning
to
him
she
should
throw
these
two
men
on
to
each
other
in
this
narrow
cave
where
they
were
all
in
agony
together
good
god
why
could
they
not
end
together
in
comradeship
étienne
would
have
died
of
inanition
rather
than
beg
a
mouthful
of
bread
from
chaval
the
silence
became
heavy
an
eternity
seemed
to
be
prolonging
itself
with
the
slowness
of
monotonous
minutes
which
passed
by
one
by
one
without
hope
they
had
now
been
shut
up
together
for
a
day
the
second
lamp
was
growing
pale
and
they
lighted
the
third
chaval
started
on
his
second
slice
of
and
growled
come
then
stupid
catherine
shivered
étienne
had
turned
away
in
order
to
leave
her
free
then
as
she
did
not
stir
he
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
go
my
child
the
tears
which
she
was
stifling
then
rushed
forth
she
wept
for
a
long
time
without
even
strength
to
rise
no
longer
knowing
if
she
was
hungry
suffering
with
pain
which
she
felt
all
over
her
body
he
was
standing
up
going
backward
and
forwards
vainly
beating
the
miners
call
enraged
at
this
remainder
of
life
which
he
was
obliged
to
live
here
tied
to
a
rival
whom
he
detested
not
even
enough
space
to
die
away
from
each
other
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
ten
paces
he
must
come
back
and
knock
up
against
this
man
and
she
this
sorrowful
girl
whom
they
were
disputing
over
even
in
the
earth
she
would
belong
to
the
one
who
lived
longest
that
man
would
steal
her
from
him
should
he
go
first
there
was
no
end
to
it
the
hours
followed
the
hours
the
revolting
promiscuity
became
worse
with
the
poison
of
their
breaths
and
the
ordure
of
their
necessities
satisfied
in
common
twice
he
rushed
against
the
rocks
as
though
to
open
them
with
his
fists
another
day
was
done
and
chaval
had
seated
himself
near
catherine
sharing
with
her
his
last
she
was
chewing
the
mouthfuls
painfully
he
made
her
pay
for
each
with
a
caress
in
his
jealous
obstinacy
not
willing
to
die
until
he
had
had
her
again
in
the
other
man
presence
she
abandoned
herself
in
exhaustion
but
when
he
tried
to
take
her
she
complained
oh
leave
me
you
breaking
my
bones
étienne
with
a
shudder
had
placed
his
forehead
against
the
timber
so
as
not
to
see
he
came
back
with
a
wild
leap
leave
her
by
god
does
it
concern
you
said
chaval
she
my
woman
i
suppose
she
belongs
to
me
and
he
took
her
again
and
pressed
her
out
of
bravado
crushing
his
red
moustache
against
her
mouth
and
continuing
will
you
leave
us
alone
eh
will
you
be
good
enough
to
look
over
there
if
we
are
at
it
but
étienne
with
white
lips
shouted
if
you
do
let
her
go
i
do
for
you
the
other
quickly
stood
up
for
he
had
understood
by
the
hiss
of
the
voice
that
his
mate
was
in
earnest
death
seemed
to
them
too
slow
it
was
necessary
that
one
of
them
should
immediately
yield
his
place
it
was
the
old
battle
beginning
over
again
down
in
the
earth
where
they
would
soon
sleep
side
by
side
and
they
had
so
little
room
that
they
could
not
swing
their
fists
without
grazing
them
look
out
growled
chaval
this
time
i
have
you
from
that
moment
étienne
became
mad
his
eyes
seemed
drowned
in
red
vapour
his
chest
was
congested
by
the
flow
of
blood
the
need
to
kill
seized
him
irresistibly
a
physical
need
like
the
irritation
of
mucus
which
causes
a
violent
spasm
of
coughing
it
rose
and
broke
out
beyond
his
will
beneath
the
pressure
of
the
hereditary
disease
he
had
seized
a
sheet
of
slate
in
the
wall
and
he
shook
it
and
tore
it
out
a
very
large
heavy
piece
then
with
both
hands
and
with
tenfold
strength
he
brought
it
down
on
chaval
skull
the
latter
had
not
time
to
jump
backwards
he
fell
his
face
crushed
his
skull
broken
the
brains
had
bespattered
the
roof
of
the
gallery
and
a
purple
jet
flowed
from
the
wound
like
the
continuous
jet
of
a
spring
immediately
there
was
a
pool
which
reflected
the
smoky
star
of
the
lamp
darkness
was
invading
the
cave
and
this
body
lying
on
the
earth
looked
like
the
black
boss
of
a
mass
of
rough
coal
leaning
over
with
wide
eyes
étienne
looked
at
him
it
was
done
then
he
had
killed
all
his
struggles
came
back
to
his
memory
confusedly
that
useless
fight
against
the
poison
which
slept
in
his
muscles
the
slowly
accumulated
alcohol
of
his
race
he
was
however
only
intoxicated
by
hunger
the
remote
intoxication
of
his
parents
had
been
enough
his
hair
stood
up
before
the
horror
of
this
murder
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
revolt
which
came
from
his
education
a
certain
gladness
made
his
heart
beat
the
animal
joy
of
an
appetite
at
length
satisfied
he
felt
pride
too
the
pride
of
the
stronger
man
the
little
soldier
appeared
before
him
with
his
throat
opened
by
a
knife
killed
by
a
child
now
he
too
had
killed
but
catherine
standing
erect
uttered
a
loud
cry
my
god
he
is
dead
are
you
sorry
asked
étienne
fiercely
she
was
choking
she
stammered
then
tottering
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
ah
kill
me
too
ah
let
us
both
die
she
clasped
him
hanging
to
his
shoulders
and
he
clasped
her
and
they
hoped
that
they
would
die
but
death
was
in
no
hurry
and
they
unlocked
their
arms
then
while
she
hid
her
eyes
he
dragged
away
the
wretch
and
threw
him
down
the
upbrow
to
remove
him
from
the
narrow
space
in
which
they
still
had
to
live
life
would
no
longer
have
been
possible
with
that
corpse
beneath
their
feet
and
they
were
terrified
when
they
heard
it
plunge
into
the
midst
of
the
foam
which
leapt
up
the
water
had
already
filled
that
hole
then
they
saw
it
it
was
entering
the
gallery
then
there
was
a
new
struggle
they
had
lighted
the
last
lamp
it
was
becoming
exhausted
in
illuminating
this
flood
with
its
regular
obstinate
rise
which
never
ceased
at
first
the
water
came
up
to
their
ankles
then
it
wetted
their
knees
the
passage
sloped
up
and
they
took
refuge
at
the
end
this
gave
them
a
respite
for
some
hours
but
the
flood
caught
them
up
and
bathed
them
to
the
waist
standing
up
brought
to
bay
with
their
spines
close
against
the
rock
they
watched
it
ever
and
ever
increasing
when
it
reached
their
mouths
all
would
be
over
the
lamp
which
they
had
fastened
up
threw
a
yellow
light
on
the
rapid
surge
of
the
little
waves
it
was
becoming
pale
they
could
distinguish
no
more
than
a
constantly
diminishing
semicircle
as
though
eaten
away
by
the
darkness
which
seemed
to
grow
with
the
flood
and
suddenly
the
darkness
enveloped
them
the
lamp
had
gone
out
after
having
spat
forth
its
last
drop
of
oil
there
was
now
complete
and
absolute
night
that
night
of
the
earth
which
they
would
have
to
sleep
through
without
ever
again
opening
their
eyes
to
the
brightness
of
the
sun
by
god
étienne
swore
in
a
low
voice
catherine
as
though
she
had
felt
the
darkness
seize
her
sheltered
herself
against
him
she
repeated
in
a
whisper
the
miner
saying
death
is
blowing
out
the
lamp
yet
in
the
face
of
this
threat
their
instincts
struggled
the
fever
for
life
animated
them
he
violently
set
himself
to
hollow
out
the
slate
with
the
hook
of
the
lamp
while
she
helped
him
with
her
nails
they
formed
a
sort
of
elevated
bench
and
when
they
had
both
hoisted
themselves
up
to
it
they
found
themselves
seated
with
hanging
legs
and
bent
backs
for
the
vault
forced
them
to
lower
their
heads
they
now
only
felt
the
icy
water
at
their
heels
but
before
long
the
cold
was
at
their
ankles
their
calves
their
knees
with
its
invincible
truceless
movement
the
bench
not
properly
smoothed
was
soaked
in
moisture
and
so
slippery
that
they
had
to
hold
themselves
on
vigorously
to
avoid
slipping
off
it
was
the
end
what
could
they
expect
reduced
to
this
niche
where
they
dared
not
move
exhausted
starving
having
neither
bread
nor
light
and
they
suffered
especially
from
the
darkness
which
would
not
allow
them
to
see
the
coming
of
death
there
was
deep
silence
the
mine
being
gorged
with
water
no
longer
stirred
they
had
nothing
beneath
them
now
but
the
sensation
of
that
sea
swelling
out
its
silent
tide
from
the
depths
of
the
galleries
the
hours
succeeded
one
another
all
equally
black
but
they
were
not
able
to
measure
their
exact
duration
becoming
more
and
more
vague
in
their
calculation
of
time
their
tortures
which
might
have
been
expected
to
lengthen
the
minutes
rapidly
bore
them
away
they
thought
that
they
had
only
been
shut
up
for
two
days
and
a
night
when
in
reality
the
third
day
had
already
come
to
an
end
all
hope
of
help
had
gone
no
one
knew
they
were
there
no
one
could
come
down
to
them
and
hunger
would
finish
them
off
if
the
inundation
spared
them
for
one
last
time
it
occurred
to
them
to
beat
the
call
but
the
stone
was
lying
beneath
the
water
besides
who
would
hear
them
catherine
was
leaning
her
aching
head
against
the
seam
when
she
sat
up
with
a
start
listen
she
said
at
first
étienne
thought
she
was
speaking
of
the
low
noise
of
the
water
he
lied
in
order
to
quiet
her
it
me
you
hear
i
moving
my
legs
no
no
not
that
over
there
listen
and
she
placed
her
ear
to
the
coal
he
understood
and
did
likewise
they
waited
for
some
seconds
with
stifled
breath
then
very
far
away
and
very
weak
they
heard
three
blows
at
long
intervals
but
they
still
doubted
their
ears
were
ringing
perhaps
it
was
the
cracking
of
the
soil
and
they
knew
not
what
to
strike
with
in
answer
étienne
had
an
idea
you
have
the
sabots
take
them
off
and
strike
with
the
heels
she
struck
beating
the
miner
call
and
they
listened
and
again
distinguished
the
three
blows
far
off
twenty
times
over
they
did
it
and
twenty
times
the
blows
replied
they
wept
and
embraced
each
other
at
the
risk
of
losing
their
balance
at
last
the
mates
were
there
they
were
coming
an
overflowing
joy
and
love
carried
away
the
torments
of
expectation
and
the
rage
of
their
vain
appeals
as
though
their
rescuers
had
only
to
split
the
rock
with
a
finger
to
deliver
them
eh
she
cried
merrily
was
it
lucky
that
i
leant
my
head
oh
you
got
an
ear
he
said
in
his
turn
now
heard
nothing
from
that
moment
they
relieved
each
other
one
of
them
always
listening
ready
to
answer
at
the
least
signal
they
soon
caught
the
sounds
of
the
pick
the
work
of
approaching
them
was
beginning
a
gallery
was
being
opened
not
a
sound
escaped
them
but
their
joy
sank
in
vain
they
laughed
to
deceive
each
other
despair
was
gradually
seizing
them
at
first
they
entered
into
long
explanations
evidently
they
were
being
approached
from
réquillart
the
gallery
descended
in
the
bed
perhaps
several
were
being
opened
for
there
were
always
three
men
hewing
then
they
talked
less
and
were
at
last
silent
when
they
came
to
calculate
the
enormous
mass
which
separated
them
from
their
mates
they
continued
their
reflections
in
silence
counting
the
days
and
days
that
a
workman
would
take
to
penetrate
such
a
block
they
would
never
be
reached
soon
enough
they
would
have
time
to
die
twenty
times
over
and
no
longer
venturing
to
exchange
a
word
in
this
redoubled
anguish
they
gloomily
replied
to
the
appeals
by
a
roll
of
the
sabots
without
hope
only
retaining
the
mechanical
need
to
tell
the
others
that
they
were
still
alive
thus
passed
a
day
two
days
they
had
been
at
the
bottom
six
days
the
water
had
stopped
at
their
knees
neither
rising
nor
falling
and
their
legs
seemed
to
be
melting
away
in
this
icy
bath
they
could
certainly
keep
them
out
for
an
hour
or
so
but
their
position
then
became
so
uncomfortable
that
they
were
twisted
by
horrible
cramps
and
were
obliged
to
let
their
feet
fall
in
again
every
ten
minutes
they
hoisted
themselves
back
by
a
jerk
on
the
slippery
rock
the
fractures
of
the
coal
struck
into
their
spines
and
they
felt
at
the
back
of
their
necks
a
fixed
intense
pain
through
having
to
keep
constantly
bent
in
order
to
avoid
striking
their
heads
and
their
suffocation
increased
the
air
driven
back
by
the
water
was
compressed
into
a
sort
of
bell
in
which
they
were
shut
up
their
voices
were
muffled
and
seemed
to
come
from
afar
their
ears
began
to
buzz
they
heard
the
peals
of
a
furious
tocsin
the
tramp
of
a
flock
beneath
a
storm
of
hail
going
on
unceasingly
at
first
catherine
suffered
horribly
from
hunger
she
pressed
her
poor
shrivelled
hands
against
her
breasts
her
breathing
was
deep
and
hollow
a
continuous
tearing
moan
as
though
tongs
were
tearing
her
stomach
étienne
choked
by
the
same
torture
was
feeling
feverishly
round
him
in
the
darkness
when
his
fingers
came
upon
a
piece
of
timber
which
his
nails
could
crumble
he
gave
a
handful
of
it
to
the
putter
who
swallowed
it
greedily
for
two
days
they
lived
on
this
wood
devouring
it
all
in
despair
when
it
was
finished
grazing
their
hands
in
the
effort
to
crush
the
other
planks
which
were
still
solid
with
resisting
fibres
their
torture
increased
and
they
were
enraged
that
they
could
not
chew
the
cloth
of
their
clothes
a
leather
belt
which
he
wore
round
the
waist
relieved
them
a
little
he
bit
small
pieces
from
it
with
his
teeth
and
she
chewed
them
and
endeavoured
to
swallow
them
this
occupied
their
jaws
and
gave
them
the
illusion
of
eating
then
when
the
belt
was
finished
they
went
back
to
their
clothes
sucking
them
for
hours
but
soon
these
violent
crises
subsided
hunger
became
only
a
low
deep
ache
with
the
slow
progressive
languor
of
their
strength
no
doubt
they
would
have
succumbed
if
they
had
not
had
as
much
water
as
they
desired
they
merely
bent
down
and
drank
from
the
hollow
of
the
hand
and
that
very
frequently
parched
by
a
thirst
which
all
this
water
could
not
quench
on
the
seventh
day
catherine
was
bending
down
to
drink
when
her
hand
struck
some
floating
body
before
her
i
say
look
what
this
étienne
felt
in
the
darkness
i
ca
make
out
it
seems
like
the
cover
of
a
ventilation
door
she
drank
but
as
she
was
drawing
up
a
second
mouthful
the
body
came
back
striking
her
hand
and
she
uttered
a
terrible
cry
my
god
it
he
whom
do
you
mean
him
you
know
well
enough
i
felt
his
moustache
it
was
chaval
corpse
risen
from
the
upbrow
and
pushed
on
to
them
by
the
flow
étienne
stretched
out
his
arm
he
too
felt
the
moustache
and
the
crushed
nose
and
shuddered
with
disgust
and
fear
seized
by
horrible
nausea
catherine
had
spat
out
the
water
which
was
still
in
her
mouth
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
drinking
blood
and
that
all
the
deep
water
before
her
was
now
that
man
blood
wait
stammered
étienne
i
push
him
off
he
kicked
the
corpse
which
moved
off
but
soon
they
felt
it
again
striking
against
their
legs
by
god
get
off
and
the
third
time
étienne
had
to
leave
it
some
current
always
brought
it
back
chaval
would
not
go
he
desired
to
be
with
them
against
them
it
was
an
awful
companion
at
last
poisoning
the
air
all
that
day
they
never
drank
struggling
preferring
to
die
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
that
their
suffering
decided
them
they
pushed
away
the
body
at
each
mouthful
and
drank
in
spite
of
it
it
had
not
been
worth
while
to
knock
his
brains
out
for
he
came
back
between
him
and
her
obstinate
in
his
jealousy
to
the
very
end
he
would
be
there
even
though
he
was
dead
preventing
them
from
coming
together
a
day
passed
and
again
another
day
at
every
shiver
of
the
water
étienne
perceived
a
slight
blow
from
the
man
he
had
killed
the
simple
elbowing
of
a
neighbour
who
is
reminding
you
of
his
presence
and
every
time
it
came
he
shuddered
he
continually
saw
it
there
swollen
greenish
with
the
red
moustache
and
the
crushed
face
then
he
no
longer
remembered
he
had
not
killed
him
the
other
man
was
swimming
and
trying
to
bite
him
catherine
was
now
shaken
by
long
endless
fits
of
crying
after
which
she
was
completely
prostrated
she
fell
at
last
into
a
condition
of
irresistible
drowsiness
he
would
arouse
her
but
she
stammered
a
few
words
and
at
once
fell
asleep
again
without
even
raising
her
eyelids
and
fearing
lest
she
should
be
drowned
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
it
was
he
now
who
replied
to
the
mates
the
blows
of
the
pick
were
now
approaching
he
could
hear
them
behind
his
back
but
his
strength
too
was
diminishing
he
had
lost
all
courage
to
strike
they
were
known
to
be
there
why
weary
oneself
more
it
no
longer
interested
him
whether
they
came
or
not
in
the
stupefaction
of
waiting
he
would
forget
for
hours
at
a
time
what
he
was
waiting
for
one
relief
comforted
them
a
little
the
water
sank
and
body
moved
off
for
nine
days
the
work
of
their
deliverance
had
been
going
on
and
they
were
for
the
first
time
taking
a
few
steps
in
the
gallery
when
a
fearful
commotion
threw
them
to
the
ground
they
felt
for
each
other
and
remained
in
each
other
arms
like
mad
people
not
understanding
thinking
the
catastrophe
was
beginning
over
again
nothing
more
stirred
the
sound
of
the
picks
had
ceased
in
the
corner
where
they
were
seated
holding
each
other
side
by
side
a
low
laugh
came
from
catherine
it
must
be
good
outside
come
let
go
out
of
here
étienne
at
first
struggled
against
this
madness
but
the
contagion
was
shaking
his
stronger
head
and
he
lost
the
exact
sensation
of
reality
all
their
senses
seemed
to
go
astray
especially
catherine
she
was
shaken
by
fever
tormented
now
by
the
need
to
talk
and
move
the
ringing
in
her
ears
had
become
the
murmur
of
flowing
water
the
song
of
birds
she
smelled
the
strong
odour
of
crushed
grass
and
could
see
clearly
great
yellow
patches
floating
before
her
eyes
so
large
that
she
thought
she
was
out
of
doors
near
the
canal
in
the
meadows
on
a
fine
summer
day
eh
how
warm
it
is
take
me
then
let
us
keep
together
oh
always
always
he
pressed
her
and
she
rubbed
herself
against
him
for
a
long
time
continuing
to
chatter
like
a
happy
girl
how
silly
we
have
been
to
wait
so
long
i
would
have
liked
you
at
once
and
you
did
not
understand
you
sulked
then
do
you
remember
at
our
house
at
night
when
we
could
not
sleep
with
our
faces
out
listening
to
each
other
breathing
with
such
a
longing
to
come
together
he
was
won
by
her
gaiety
and
joked
over
the
recollection
of
their
silent
tenderness
you
struck
me
once
yes
yes
blows
on
both
cheeks
it
was
because
i
loved
you
she
murmured
you
see
i
prevented
myself
from
thinking
of
you
i
said
to
myself
that
it
was
quite
done
with
and
all
the
time
i
knew
that
one
day
or
another
we
should
get
together
it
only
wanted
an
opportunity
some
lucky
chance
was
it
so
a
shudder
froze
him
he
tried
to
shake
off
this
dream
then
he
repeated
slowly
nothing
is
ever
done
with
a
little
happiness
is
enough
to
make
everything
begin
again
then
you
keep
me
and
it
will
be
all
right
this
time
and
she
slipped
down
fainting
she
was
so
weak
that
her
low
voice
died
out
in
terror
he
kept
her
against
his
heart
are
you
in
pain
she
sat
up
surprised
no
not
at
all
why
but
this
question
aroused
her
from
her
dream
she
gazed
at
the
darkness
with
distraction
wringing
her
hands
in
another
fit
of
sobbing
my
god
my
god
how
black
it
is
it
was
no
longer
the
meadows
the
odour
of
the
grass
the
song
of
larks
the
great
yellow
sun
it
was
the
fallen
inundated
mine
the
stinking
gloom
the
melancholy
dripping
of
this
cellar
where
they
had
been
groaning
for
so
many
days
her
perverted
senses
now
increased
the
horror
of
it
her
childish
superstitions
came
back
to
her
she
saw
the
black
man
the
old
dead
miner
who
returns
to
the
pit
to
twist
naughty
girls
necks
listen
did
you
hear
no
nothing
i
heard
nothing
yes
the
man
you
know
look
he
is
there
the
earth
has
let
all
the
blood
out
of
the
vein
to
revenge
itself
for
being
cut
into
and
he
is
there
you
can
see
him
look
blacker
than
night
oh
i
so
afraid
i
so
afraid
she
became
silent
shivering
then
in
a
very
low
voice
she
whispered
no
it
always
the
other
one
what
other
one
him
who
is
with
us
who
is
not
alive
the
image
of
chaval
haunted
her
she
talked
of
him
confusedly
she
described
the
dog
life
she
led
with
him
the
only
day
when
he
had
been
kind
to
her
at
the
other
days
of
follies
and
blows
when
he
would
kill
her
with
caresses
after
having
covered
her
with
kicks
i
tell
you
that
he
coming
that
he
will
still
keep
us
from
being
together
his
jealousy
is
coming
on
him
again
oh
push
him
off
oh
keep
me
close
with
a
sudden
impulse
she
hung
on
to
him
seeking
his
mouth
and
pressing
her
own
passionately
to
it
the
darkness
lighted
up
she
saw
the
sun
again
and
she
laughed
a
quiet
laugh
of
love
he
shuddered
to
feel
her
thus
against
his
flesh
half
naked
beneath
the
tattered
jacket
and
trousers
and
he
seized
her
with
a
reawakening
of
his
virility
it
was
at
length
their
wedding
night
at
the
bottom
of
this
tomb
on
this
bed
of
mud
the
longing
not
to
die
before
they
had
had
their
happiness
the
obstinate
longing
to
live
and
make
life
one
last
time
they
loved
each
other
in
despair
of
everything
in
death
after
that
there
was
nothing
more
étienne
was
seated
on
the
ground
always
in
the
same
corner
and
catherine
was
lying
motionless
on
his
knees
hours
and
hours
passed
by
for
a
long
time
he
thought
she
was
sleeping
then
he
touched
her
she
was
very
cold
she
was
dead
he
did
not
move
however
for
fear
of
arousing
her
the
idea
that
he
was
the
first
who
had
possessed
her
as
a
woman
and
that
she
might
be
pregnant
filled
him
with
tenderness
other
ideas
the
desire
to
go
away
with
her
joy
at
what
they
would
both
do
later
on
came
to
him
at
moments
but
so
vaguely
that
it
seemed
only
as
though
his
forehead
had
been
touched
by
a
breath
of
sleep
he
grew
weaker
he
only
had
strength
to
make
a
little
gesture
a
slow
movement
of
the
hand
to
assure
himself
that
she
was
certainly
there
like
a
sleeping
child
in
her
frozen
stiffness
everything
was
being
annihilated
the
night
itself
had
disappeared
and
he
was
nowhere
out
of
space
out
of
time
something
was
certainly
striking
beside
his
head
violent
blows
were
approaching
him
but
he
had
been
too
lazy
to
reply
benumbed
by
immense
fatigue
and
now
he
knew
nothing
he
only
dreamed
that
she
was
walking
before
him
and
that
he
heard
the
slight
clank
of
her
sabots
two
days
passed
she
had
not
stirred
he
touched
her
with
his
mechanical
gesture
reassured
to
find
her
so
quiet
étienne
felt
a
shock
voices
were
sounding
rocks
were
rolling
to
his
feet
when
he
perceived
a
lamp
he
wept
his
blinking
eyes
followed
the
light
he
was
never
tired
of
looking
at
it
enraptured
by
this
reddish
point
which
scarcely
stained
the
darkness
but
some
mates
carried
him
away
and
he
allowed
them
to
introduce
some
spoonfuls
of
soup
between
his
clenched
teeth
it
was
only
in
the
réquillart
gallery
that
he
recognized
someone
standing
before
him
the
engineer
négrel
and
these
two
men
with
their
contempt
for
each
other
the
rebellious
workman
and
the
sceptical
master
threw
themselves
on
each
other
necks
sobbing
loudly
in
the
deep
upheaval
of
all
the
humanity
within
them
it
was
an
immense
sadness
the
misery
of
generations
the
extremity
of
grief
into
which
life
can
fall
at
the
surface
maheude
stricken
down
near
dead
catherine
uttered
a
cry
then
another
then
another
very
long
deep
incessant
moans
several
corpses
had
already
been
brought
up
and
placed
in
a
row
on
the
ground
chaval
who
was
thought
to
have
been
crushed
beneath
a
landslip
a
trammer
and
two
hewers
also
crushed
with
brainless
skulls
and
bellies
swollen
with
water
women
in
the
crowd
went
out
of
their
minds
tearing
their
skirts
and
scratching
their
faces
when
étienne
was
at
last
taken
out
after
having
been
accustomed
to
the
lamps
and
fed
a
little
he
appeared
fleshless
and
his
hair
was
quite
white
people
turned
away
and
shuddered
at
this
old
man
maheude
left
off
crying
to
stare
at
him
stupidly
with
her
large
fixed
eyes
chapter
vi
it
was
four
in
the
morning
and
the
fresh
april
night
was
growing
warm
at
the
approach
of
day
in
the
limpid
sky
the
stars
were
twinkling
out
while
the
east
grew
purple
with
dawn
and
a
slight
shudder
passed
over
the
drowsy
black
country
the
vague
rumour
which
precedes
awakening
étienne
with
long
strides
was
following
the
vandame
road
he
had
just
passed
six
weeks
at
montsou
in
bed
at
the
hospital
though
very
thin
and
yellow
he
felt
strength
to
go
and
he
went
the
company
still
trembling
for
its
pits
was
constantly
sending
men
away
and
had
given
him
notice
that
he
could
not
be
kept
on
he
was
offered
the
sum
of
one
hundred
francs
with
the
paternal
advice
to
leave
off
working
in
mines
as
it
would
now
be
too
severe
for
him
but
he
refused
the
hundred
francs
he
had
already
received
a
letter
from
pluchart
calling
him
to
paris
and
enclosing
money
for
the
journey
his
old
dream
would
be
realized
the
night
before
on
leaving
the
hospital
he
had
slept
at
the
widow
désir
and
he
rose
early
only
one
desire
was
left
to
bid
his
mates
farewell
before
taking
the
eight
train
at
marchiennes
for
a
moment
étienne
stopped
on
the
road
which
was
now
becoming
it
was
good
to
breathe
that
pure
air
of
the
precocious
spring
it
would
turn
out
a
superb
day
the
sun
was
slowly
rising
and
the
life
of
the
earth
was
rising
with
it
and
he
set
out
walking
again
vigorously
striking
with
his
brier
stick
watching
the
plain
afar
as
it
rose
from
the
vapours
of
the
night
he
had
seen
no
one
maheude
had
come
once
to
the
hospital
and
probably
had
not
been
able
to
come
again
but
he
knew
that
the
whole
settlement
of
the
was
now
going
down
at
and
that
she
too
had
taken
work
there
little
by
little
the
deserted
roads
were
peopled
and
colliers
constantly
passed
étienne
with
pallid
silent
faces
the
company
people
said
was
abusing
its
victory
after
two
and
a
half
months
of
strike
when
they
had
returned
to
the
pits
conquered
by
hunger
they
had
been
obliged
to
accept
the
timbering
tariff
that
disguised
decrease
in
wages
now
the
more
hateful
because
stained
with
the
blood
of
their
mates
they
were
being
robbed
of
an
hour
work
they
were
being
made
false
to
their
oath
never
to
submit
and
this
imposed
perjury
stuck
in
their
throats
like
gall
work
was
beginning
again
everywhere
at
mirou
at
madeleine
at
crévecoeur
at
the
victoire
everywhere
in
the
morning
haze
along
the
roads
lost
in
darkness
the
flock
was
tramping
on
rows
of
men
trotting
with
faces
bent
towards
the
earth
like
cattle
led
to
the
they
shivered
beneath
their
thin
garments
folding
their
arms
rolling
their
hips
expanding
their
backs
with
the
humps
formed
by
the
brick
between
the
shirt
and
the
jacket
and
in
this
wholesale
return
to
work
in
these
mute
shadows
all
black
without
a
laugh
without
a
look
aside
one
felt
the
teeth
clenched
with
rage
the
hearts
swollen
with
hatred
a
simple
resignation
to
the
necessity
of
the
belly
the
nearer
étienne
approached
the
pit
the
more
their
number
increased
they
nearly
all
walked
alone
those
who
came
in
groups
were
in
single
file
already
exhausted
tired
of
one
another
and
of
themselves
he
noticed
one
who
was
very
old
with
eyes
that
shone
like
hot
coals
beneath
his
livid
forehead
another
a
young
man
was
panting
with
the
restrained
fury
of
a
storm
many
had
their
sabots
in
their
hands
one
could
scarcely
hear
the
soft
sound
of
their
coarse
woollen
stockings
on
the
ground
it
was
an
endless
rustling
a
general
downfall
the
forced
march
of
a
beaten
army
moving
on
with
lowered
heads
sullenly
absorbed
in
the
desire
to
renew
the
struggle
and
achieve
revenge
when
étienne
arrived
was
emerging
from
the
shade
the
lanterns
hooked
on
to
the
platform
were
still
burning
in
the
growing
dawn
above
the
obscure
buildings
a
trail
of
steam
arose
like
a
white
plume
delicately
tinted
with
carmine
he
passed
up
the
to
go
to
the
the
descent
was
beginning
and
the
men
were
coming
from
the
shed
for
a
moment
he
stood
by
motionless
amid
the
noise
and
movement
the
rolling
of
the
trams
shook
the
metal
floor
the
drums
were
turning
unrolling
the
cables
in
the
midst
of
cries
from
the
trumpet
the
ringing
of
bells
blows
of
the
mallet
on
the
signal
block
he
found
the
monster
again
swallowing
his
daily
ration
of
human
flesh
the
cages
rising
and
plunging
engulfing
their
burden
of
men
without
ceasing
with
the
facile
gulp
of
a
voracious
giant
since
his
accident
he
had
a
nervous
horror
of
the
mine
the
cages
as
they
sank
down
tore
his
bowels
he
had
to
turn
away
his
head
the
pit
exasperated
him
but
in
the
vast
and
still
sombre
hall
feebly
lighted
up
by
the
exhausted
lanterns
he
could
perceive
no
friendly
face
the
miners
who
were
waiting
there
with
bare
feet
and
their
lamps
in
their
hands
looked
at
him
with
large
restless
eyes
and
then
lowered
their
faces
drawing
back
with
an
air
of
shame
no
doubt
they
knew
him
and
no
longer
had
any
spite
against
him
they
seemed
on
the
contrary
to
fear
him
blushing
at
the
thought
that
he
would
reproach
them
with
cowardice
this
attitude
made
his
heart
swell
he
forgot
that
these
wretches
had
stoned
him
he
again
began
to
dream
of
changing
them
into
heroes
of
directing
a
whole
people
this
force
of
nature
which
was
devouring
itself
a
cage
was
embarking
its
men
and
the
batch
disappeared
as
others
arrived
he
saw
at
last
one
of
his
lieutenants
in
the
strike
a
worthy
fellow
who
had
sworn
to
die
you
too
he
murmured
with
aching
heart
the
other
turned
pale
and
his
lips
trembled
then
with
a
movement
of
excuse
what
would
you
have
i
got
a
wife
now
in
the
new
crowd
coming
from
the
shed
he
recognized
them
all
you
too
you
too
you
too
and
all
shrank
back
stammering
in
choked
voices
i
have
a
mother
i
have
children
one
must
get
bread
the
cage
did
not
reappear
they
waited
for
it
mournfully
with
such
sorrow
at
their
defeat
that
they
avoided
meeting
each
other
eyes
obstinately
gazing
at
the
shaft
and
maheude
étienne
asked
they
made
no
reply
one
made
a
sign
that
she
was
coming
others
raised
their
arms
trembling
with
pity
ah
poor
woman
what
wretchedness
the
silence
continued
and
when
étienne
stretched
out
his
hand
to
bid
them
farewell
they
all
pressed
it
vigorously
putting
into
that
mute
squeeze
their
rage
at
having
yielded
their
feverish
hope
of
revenge
the
cage
was
there
they
got
into
it
and
sank
devoured
by
the
gulf
pierron
had
appeared
with
his
naked
captain
lamp
fixed
into
the
leather
of
his
cap
for
the
past
week
he
had
been
chief
of
the
gang
at
the
and
the
men
moved
away
for
promotion
had
rendered
him
bossy
the
sight
of
étienne
annoyed
him
he
came
up
however
and
was
at
last
reassured
when
the
young
man
announced
his
departure
they
talked
his
wife
now
kept
the
estaminet
du
progrés
thanks
to
the
support
of
all
those
gentlemen
who
had
been
so
good
to
her
but
he
interrupted
himself
and
turned
furiously
on
to
father
mouque
whom
he
accused
of
not
sending
up
the
from
his
stable
at
the
regulation
hour
the
old
man
listened
with
bent
shoulders
then
before
going
down
suffering
from
this
reprimand
he
too
gave
his
hand
to
étienne
with
the
same
long
pressure
as
the
others
warm
with
restrained
anger
and
quivering
with
future
rebellion
and
this
old
hand
which
trembled
in
his
this
old
man
who
was
forgiving
him
for
the
loss
of
his
dead
children
affected
étienne
to
such
a
degree
that
he
watched
him
disappear
without
saying
a
word
then
maheude
is
not
coming
this
morning
he
asked
pierron
after
a
time
at
first
the
latter
pretended
not
to
understand
for
there
was
ill
luck
even
in
speaking
of
her
then
as
he
moved
away
under
the
pretext
of
giving
an
order
he
said
at
last
eh
maheude
there
she
is
in
fact
maheude
had
reached
the
shed
with
her
lamp
in
her
hand
dressed
in
trousers
and
jacket
with
her
head
confined
in
the
cap
it
was
by
a
charitable
exception
that
the
company
pitying
the
fate
of
this
unhappy
woman
so
cruelly
afflicted
had
allowed
her
to
go
down
again
at
the
age
of
forty
and
as
it
seemed
difficult
to
set
her
again
at
haulage
work
she
was
employed
to
manipulate
a
small
ventilator
which
had
been
installed
in
the
north
gallery
in
those
infernal
regions
beneath
tartaret
where
there
was
no
movement
of
air
for
ten
hours
with
aching
back
she
turned
her
wheel
at
the
bottom
of
a
burning
tube
baked
by
forty
degrees
of
heat
she
earned
thirty
sous
when
étienne
saw
her
a
pitiful
sight
in
her
male
garments
her
breast
and
belly
seeming
to
be
swollen
by
the
dampness
of
the
cuttings
he
stammered
with
surprise
trying
to
find
words
to
explain
that
he
was
going
away
and
that
he
wished
to
say
to
her
she
looked
at
him
without
listening
and
said
at
last
speaking
familiarly
eh
it
surprises
you
to
see
me
it
true
enough
that
i
threatened
to
wring
the
neck
of
the
first
of
my
children
who
went
down
again
and
now
that
i
going
down
i
ought
to
wring
my
own
ought
i
not
ah
well
i
should
have
done
it
by
now
if
it
had
been
for
the
old
man
and
the
little
ones
at
the
house
and
she
went
on
in
her
low
fatigued
voice
she
did
not
excuse
herself
she
simply
narrated
things
that
they
had
been
nearly
starved
and
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
it
so
that
they
might
not
be
sent
away
from
the
settlement
how
is
the
old
man
asked
étienne
he
is
always
very
gentle
and
very
clean
but
he
is
quite
off
his
nut
he
was
not
brought
up
for
that
affair
you
know
there
was
talk
of
shutting
him
up
with
the
madmen
but
i
was
not
willing
they
would
have
done
for
him
in
his
soup
his
story
has
all
the
same
been
very
bad
for
us
for
he
never
get
his
pension
one
of
those
gentlemen
told
me
that
it
would
be
immoral
to
give
him
one
is
jeanlin
working
yes
those
gentlemen
found
something
for
him
to
do
at
the
top
he
gets
twenty
sous
oh
i
do
complain
the
bosses
have
been
very
good
as
they
told
me
themselves
the
brat
twenty
sous
and
my
thirty
that
makes
fifty
if
there
were
not
six
of
us
we
should
get
enough
to
eat
estelle
devours
now
and
the
worst
is
that
it
will
be
four
or
five
years
before
lénore
and
henri
are
old
enough
to
come
to
the
pit
étienne
could
not
restrain
a
movement
of
pain
they
too
maheude
pale
cheeks
turned
red
and
her
eyes
flamed
but
her
shoulders
sank
as
if
beneath
the
weight
of
destiny
what
would
you
have
they
after
the
others
they
have
all
been
done
for
there
now
it
their
turn
she
was
silent
some
landers
who
were
rolling
trams
disturbed
them
through
the
large
dusty
windows
the
early
sun
was
entering
drowning
the
lanterns
in
grey
light
and
the
engine
moved
every
three
minutes
the
cables
unrolled
the
cages
continued
to
swallow
down
men
come
along
you
loungers
look
sharp
shouted
pierron
get
in
we
shall
never
have
done
with
it
today
maheude
whom
he
was
looking
at
did
not
stir
she
had
already
allowed
three
cages
to
pass
and
she
said
as
though
arousing
herself
and
remembering
étienne
first
words
then
you
going
away
yes
this
morning
you
right
better
be
somewhere
else
if
one
can
and
i
glad
to
have
seen
you
because
you
can
know
now
anyhow
that
i
nothing
on
my
mind
against
you
for
a
moment
i
could
have
killed
you
after
all
that
slaughter
but
one
thinks
does
one
one
sees
that
when
reckoned
up
it
nobody
fault
no
no
it
not
your
fault
it
the
fault
of
everybody
now
she
talked
with
tranquillity
of
her
dead
of
her
man
of
zacharie
of
catherine
and
tears
only
came
into
her
eyes
when
she
uttered
alzire
name
she
had
resumed
her
calm
reasonableness
and
judged
things
sensibly
it
would
bring
no
luck
to
the
middle
class
to
have
killed
so
many
poor
people
sure
enough
they
would
be
punished
for
it
one
day
for
everything
has
to
be
paid
for
there
would
even
be
no
need
to
interfere
the
whole
thing
would
explode
by
itself
the
soldiers
would
fire
on
the
masters
just
as
they
had
fired
on
the
men
and
in
her
everlasting
resignation
in
that
hereditary
discipline
under
which
she
was
again
bowing
a
conviction
had
established
itself
the
certainty
that
injustice
could
not
last
longer
and
that
if
there
were
no
good
god
left
another
would
spring
up
to
avenge
the
wretched
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
with
suspicious
glances
round
then
as
pierron
was
coming
up
she
added
aloud
well
if
you
going
you
must
take
your
things
from
our
house
there
are
still
two
shirts
three
handkerchiefs
and
an
old
pair
of
trousers
étienne
with
a
gesture
refused
these
few
things
saved
from
the
dealers
no
it
not
worth
while
they
can
be
for
the
children
at
paris
i
can
arrange
for
myself
two
more
cages
had
gone
down
and
pierron
decided
to
speak
straight
to
maheude
i
say
now
over
there
they
are
waiting
for
you
is
that
little
chat
nearly
done
but
she
turned
her
back
why
should
he
be
so
zealous
this
man
who
had
sold
himself
the
descent
did
concern
him
his
men
hated
him
enough
already
on
his
level
and
she
persisted
with
her
lamp
in
her
hand
frozen
amid
the
draughts
in
spite
of
the
mildness
of
the
season
neither
étienne
nor
she
found
anything
more
to
say
they
remained
facing
each
other
with
hearts
so
full
that
they
would
have
liked
to
speak
once
more
at
last
she
spoke
for
the
sake
of
speaking
the
levaque
is
in
the
family
way
levaque
is
still
in
prison
bouteloup
is
taking
his
place
meanwhile
ah
yes
bouteloup
and
listen
did
i
tell
you
philoméne
has
gone
away
what
gone
away
yes
gone
away
with
a
miner
i
was
afraid
she
would
leave
the
two
brats
on
me
but
no
she
took
them
with
her
eh
a
woman
who
spits
blood
and
always
looks
as
if
she
were
on
the
point
of
death
she
mused
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
in
a
slow
voice
there
been
talk
on
my
account
you
remember
they
said
i
slept
with
you
lord
after
my
man
death
that
might
very
well
have
happened
if
i
had
been
younger
but
now
i
glad
it
was
so
for
we
should
have
regretted
it
sure
enough
yes
we
should
have
regretted
it
étienne
repeated
simply
that
was
all
they
spoke
no
more
a
cage
was
waiting
for
her
she
was
being
called
angrily
threatened
with
a
fine
then
she
made
up
her
mind
and
pressed
his
hand
deeply
moved
he
still
looked
at
her
so
worn
and
worked
out
with
her
livid
face
her
discoloured
hair
escaping
from
the
blue
cap
her
body
as
of
a
good
beast
deformed
beneath
the
jacket
and
trousers
and
in
this
last
pressure
of
the
hands
he
felt
again
the
long
silent
pressure
of
his
mates
giving
him
a
rendezvous
for
the
day
when
they
would
begin
again
he
understood
perfectly
there
was
a
tranquil
faith
in
the
depths
of
her
eyes
it
would
be
soon
and
this
time
it
would
be
the
final
blow
what
a
damned
shammer
exclaimed
pierron
pushed
and
hustled
maheude
squeezed
into
a
tram
with
four
others
the
was
drawn
to
strike
for
meat
the
cage
was
unhooked
and
fell
into
the
night
and
there
was
nothing
more
but
the
rapid
flight
of
the
cable
then
étienne
left
the
pit
below
beneath
the
he
noticed
a
creature
seated
on
the
earth
with
legs
stretched
out
in
the
midst
of
a
thick
pile
of
coal
it
was
jeanlin
who
was
employed
there
to
clean
the
large
coal
he
held
a
block
of
coal
between
his
thighs
and
freed
it
with
a
hammer
from
the
fragments
of
slate
a
fine
powder
drowned
him
in
such
a
flood
of
soot
that
the
young
man
would
never
have
recognized
him
if
the
child
had
not
lifted
his
face
with
the
protruding
ears
and
small
greenish
eyes
he
laughed
with
a
joking
air
and
giving
a
final
blow
to
the
block
disappeared
in
the
black
dust
which
arose
outside
étienne
followed
the
road
for
a
while
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
all
sorts
of
ideas
were
buzzing
in
his
head
but
he
felt
the
open
air
the
free
sky
and
he
breathed
deeply
the
sun
was
appearing
in
glory
at
the
horizon
there
was
a
reawakening
of
gladness
over
the
whole
country
a
flood
of
gold
rolled
from
the
east
to
the
west
on
the
immense
plain
this
heat
of
life
was
expanding
and
extending
in
a
tremor
of
youth
in
which
vibrated
the
sighs
of
the
earth
the
song
of
birds
all
the
murmuring
sounds
of
the
waters
and
the
woods
it
was
good
to
live
and
the
old
world
wanted
to
live
through
one
more
spring
and
penetrated
by
that
hope
étienne
slackened
his
walk
his
eyes
wandering
to
right
and
to
left
amid
the
gaiety
of
the
new
season
he
thought
about
himself
he
felt
himself
strong
seasoned
by
his
hard
experiences
at
the
bottom
of
the
mine
his
education
was
complete
he
was
going
away
armed
a
rational
soldier
of
the
revolution
having
declared
war
against
society
as
he
saw
it
and
as
he
condemned
it
the
joy
of
rejoining
pluchart
and
of
being
like
pluchart
a
leader
who
was
listened
to
inspired
him
with
speeches
and
he
began
to
arrange
the
phrases
he
was
meditating
an
enlarged
programme
that
refinement
which
had
raised
him
above
his
class
had
deepened
his
hatred
of
the
middle
class
he
felt
the
need
of
glorifying
these
workers
whose
odour
of
wretchedness
was
now
unpleasant
to
him
he
would
show
that
they
alone
were
great
and
stainless
the
only
nobility
and
the
only
strength
in
which
humanity
could
be
dipped
afresh
he
already
saw
himself
in
the
tribune
triumphing
with
the
people
if
the
people
did
not
devour
him
the
loud
song
of
a
lark
made
him
look
up
towards
the
sky
little
red
clouds
the
last
vapours
of
the
night
were
melting
in
the
limpid
blue
and
the
vague
faces
of
souvarine
and
rasseneur
came
to
his
memory
decidedly
all
was
spoilt
when
each
man
tried
to
get
power
for
himself
thus
that
famous
international
which
was
to
have
renewed
the
world
had
impotently
miscarried
and
its
formidable
army
had
been
cut
up
and
crumbled
away
from
internal
dissensions
was
darwin
right
then
and
the
world
only
a
battlefield
where
the
strong
ate
the
weak
for
the
sake
of
the
beauty
and
continuance
of
the
race
this
question
troubled
him
although
he
settled
it
like
a
man
who
is
satisfied
with
his
knowledge
but
one
idea
dissipated
his
doubts
and
enchanted
him
that
of
taking
up
his
old
explanation
of
the
theory
the
first
time
that
he
should
speak
if
any
class
must
be
devoured
would
not
the
people
still
new
and
full
of
life
devour
the
middle
class
exhausted
by
enjoyment
the
new
society
would
arise
from
new
blood
and
in
this
expectation
of
an
invasion
of
barbarians
regenerating
the
old
decayed
nations
reappeared
his
absolute
faith
in
an
approaching
revolution
the
real
one
that
of
the
workers
the
fire
of
which
would
inflame
this
century
end
with
that
purple
of
the
rising
sun
which
he
saw
like
blood
on
the
sky
he
still
walked
dreaming
striking
his
brier
stick
against
the
flints
on
the
road
and
when
he
glanced
around
him
he
recognized
the
various
places
just
there
at
the
he
remembered
that
he
had
taken
command
of
the
band
that
morning
when
the
pits
were
sacked
today
the
brutish
deathly
work
was
beginning
over
again
beneath
the
earth
down
there
at
seven
hundred
metres
it
seemed
to
him
he
heard
low
regular
continuous
blows
it
was
the
men
he
had
just
seen
go
down
the
black
workers
who
were
hammering
in
their
silent
rage
no
doubt
they
were
beaten
they
had
left
their
dead
and
their
money
on
the
field
but
paris
would
not
forget
the
volleys
fired
at
the
voreux
and
the
blood
of
the
empire
too
would
flow
from
that
incurable
wound
and
if
the
industrial
crisis
was
drawing
to
an
end
if
the
workshops
were
opening
again
one
by
one
a
state
of
war
was
no
less
declared
and
peace
was
henceforth
impossible
the
colliers
had
reckoned
up
their
men
they
had
tried
their
strength
with
their
cry
for
justice
arousing
the
workers
all
over
france
their
defeat
therefore
reassured
no
one
the
montsou
bourgeois
in
their
victory
felt
the
vague
uneasiness
that
arises
on
the
morrow
of
a
strike
looking
behind
them
to
see
if
their
end
did
not
lie
inevitably
over
there
in
spite
of
all
beyond
that
great
silence
they
understood
that
the
revolution
would
be
born
again
unceasingly
perhaps
with
a
general
strike
the
common
understanding
of
all
workers
having
general
funds
and
so
able
to
hold
out
for
months
eating
their
own
bread
this
time
a
push
only
had
been
given
to
a
ruinous
society
but
they
had
heard
the
rumbling
beneath
their
feet
and
they
felt
more
shocks
arising
and
still
more
until
the
old
edifice
would
be
crushed
fallen
in
and
swallowed
going
down
like
the
voreux
to
the
abyss
étienne
took
the
joiselle
road
to
the
left
he
remembered
that
he
had
prevented
the
band
from
rushing
on
to
afar
in
the
clear
sky
he
saw
the
steeples
of
several
pits
mirou
to
the
right
madeleine
and
crévecoeur
side
by
side
work
was
going
on
everywhere
he
seemed
to
be
able
to
catch
the
blows
of
the
pick
at
the
bottom
of
the
earth
striking
now
from
one
end
of
the
plain
to
the
other
one
blow
and
another
blow
and
yet
more
blows
beneath
the
fields
and
roads
and
villages
which
were
laughing
in
the
light
all
the
obscure
labour
of
the
underground
prison
so
crushed
by
the
enormous
mass
of
the
rocks
that
one
had
to
know
it
was
underneath
there
to
distinguish
its
great
painful
sigh
and
he
now
thought
that
perhaps
violence
would
not
hasten
things
cutting
cables
tearing
up
rails
breaking
lamps
what
a
useless
task
it
was
it
was
not
worth
while
for
three
thousand
men
to
rush
about
in
a
devastating
band
doing
that
he
vaguely
divined
that
lawful
methods
might
one
day
be
more
terrible
his
reason
was
ripening
he
had
sown
the
wild
oats
of
his
spite
yes
maheude
had
well
said
with
her
good
sense
that
that
would
be
the
great
blow
to
organize
quietly
to
know
one
another
to
unite
in
associations
when
the
laws
would
permit
it
then
on
the
morning
when
they
felt
their
strength
and
millions
of
workers
would
be
face
to
face
with
a
few
thousand
idlers
to
take
the
power
into
their
own
hands
and
become
the
masters
ah
what
a
reawakening
of
truth
and
justice
the
sated
and
crouching
god
would
at
once
get
his
the
monstrous
idol
hidden
in
the
depths
of
his
sanctuary
in
that
unknown
distance
where
poor
wretches
fed
him
with
their
flesh
without
ever
having
seen
him
but
étienne
leaving
the
vandame
road
now
came
on
to
the
paved
street
on
the
right
he
saw
montsou
which
was
lost
in
the
valley
opposite
were
the
ruins
of
the
voreux
the
accursed
hole
where
three
pumps
worked
unceasingly
then
there
were
the
other
pits
at
the
horizon
the
victoire
while
towards
the
north
the
tall
chimneys
of
the
blast
furnaces
and
the
batteries
of
coke
ovens
were
smoking
in
the
transparent
morning
air
if
he
was
not
to
lose
the
eight
train
he
must
hasten
for
he
had
still
six
kilometres
before
him
and
beneath
his
feet
the
deep
blows
those
obstinate
blows
of
the
pick
continued
the
mates
were
all
there
he
heard
them
following
him
at
every
stride
was
not
that
maheude
beneath
the
beetroots
with
bent
back
and
hoarse
respiration
accompanying
the
rumble
of
the
ventilator
to
left
to
right
farther
on
he
seemed
to
recognize
others
beneath
the
wheatfields
the
hedges
the
young
trees
now
the
april
sun
in
the
open
sky
was
shining
in
his
glory
and
warming
the
pregnant
earth
from
its
fertile
flanks
life
was
leaping
out
buds
were
bursting
into
green
leaves
and
the
fields
were
quivering
with
the
growth
of
the
grass
on
every
side
seeds
were
swelling
stretching
out
cracking
the
plain
filled
by
the
need
of
heat
and
light
an
overflow
of
sap
was
mixed
with
whispering
voices
the
sound
of
the
germs
expanding
in
a
great
kiss
again
and
again
more
and
more
distinctly
as
though
they
were
approaching
the
soil
the
mates
were
hammering
in
the
fiery
rays
of
the
sun
on
this
youthful
morning
the
country
seemed
full
of
that
sound
men
were
springing
forth
a
black
avenging
army
germinating
slowly
in
the
furrows
growing
towards
the
harvests
of
the
next
century
and
their
germination
would
soon
overturn
the
earth
