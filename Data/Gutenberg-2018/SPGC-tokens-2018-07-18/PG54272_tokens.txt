past

when
she
perceived
a
group
of
men
leaning
against
the
parapet
and
looking
down
into
the
street
below
hippolyte
stopped
and
exclaimed
what
has
happened
with
a
slight
gesture
betraying
fear
she
placed
her
hand
involuntarily
on
george
s
arm
as
if
to
restrain
him
after
watching
the
men
a
moment
george
said
someone
must
have
leaped
from
off
the
terrace
then
he
added
shall
we
turn
back
she
hesitated
a
few
moments
wavering
between
curiosity
and
fear
and
then
replied
no
let
s
see
what
it
is
they
advanced
along
the
parapet
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
walk
unconsciously
hippolyte
accelerated
her
pace
towards
the
small
crowd
that
had
gathered
on
this
march
afternoon
the
pincio
was
almost
deserted
occasional
sounds
died
away
in
the
gray
and
heavy
atmosphere
that
s
what
it
is
said
george
someone
has
killed
himself
they
stopped
close
to
the
crowd
all
the
spectators
had
their
gaze
intently
fixed
upon
the
pavement
below
most
of
them
were
workmen
without
occupation
their
faces
each
different
expressed
neither
compassion
nor
sorrow
and
the
immobility
of
the
gaze
imparted
a
sort
of
bestial
dulness
to
their
eyes
a
young
lad
came
up
eager
to
see
but
scarcely
had
he
ensconced
himself
in
a
position
satisfactory
to
himself
than
he
was
hailed
by
one
of
the
bystanders
in
an
indefinable
tone
of
jubilation
and
pleasantry
as
if
delighted
that
no
new
arrival
could
enjoy
the
spectacle
you
re
too
late
he
cried
they
ve
taken
him
away
where
to
to
the
santa
maria
del
popolo
dead
yes
dead
another
individual
emaciated
and
of
a
greenish
complexion
with
a
large
woollen
muffler
around
his
neck
leaned
half
over
then
removing
a
pipe
from
his
mouth
he
shouted
what
s
that
on
the
ground
his
mouth
was
distorted
on
one
side
seamed
as
if
by
a
burn
and
convulsed
as
if
by
an
endless
flow
of
bitter
saliva
his
voice
was
so
deep
that
it
sounded
as
if
it
emerged
from
a
cavern
what
s
that
on
the
ground
he
repeated
down
in
the
street
below
a
was
squatting
close
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
so
as
to
hear
his
answer
the
better
the
spectators
became
quiet
and
motionless
on
the
pavement
could
be
seen
a
little
blackish
mud
it
s
blood
replied
the
without
rising
and
with
the
point
of
a
stick
he
continued
his
search
in
the
bloody
mire
anything
else
asked
the
man
with
the
pipe
the
rose
on
the
end
of
his
stick
he
held
something
extended
that
could
not
be
identified
from
above
hair
what
color
blond
the
precipice
formed
by
the
high
walls
lent
a
strange
resonance
to
the
voices
let
us
go
george
pleaded
hippolyte
disturbed
and
pale
she
shook
her
lover
s
arm
as
he
leaned
against
the
parapet
near
the
group
fascinated
by
the
horror
of
the
scene
they
silently
left
the
tragic
spot
both
were
preoccupied
with
painful
thoughts
of
this
death
and
sadness
was
visible
on
their
features
happy
are
the
dead
exclaimed
george
at
last
they
have
no
more
doubts
that
s
true
replied
his
companion
the
weary
tones
in
which
both
spoke
seemed
to
indicate
boundless
discouragement
she
bent
her
head
and
added
with
a
bitterness
mixed
with
regret
poor
love
what
love
asked
george
preoccupied
ours
do
you
feel
that
it
is
growing
cold
in
me
no
replied
hippolyte
significantly
but
you
think
it
is
in
me
persisted
george
an
irritation
lent
sharpness
to
his
words
fixing
his
gaze
on
her
he
repeated
but
you
think
it
is
in
me
don
t
you
she
remained
silent
her
head
drooping
still
lower
you
won
t
answer
you
know
you
re
not
telling
the
truth
there
was
a
pause
both
felt
an
unspeakable
desire
to
read
the
other
s
heart
then
he
continued
that
is
how
the
agony
of
love
begins
you
are
not
as
yet
aware
of
it
but
since
your
return
i
have
studied
you
ceaselessly
and
i
daily
discover
in
you
a
new
symptom
what
symptom
a
bad
symptom
hippolyte
then
in
a
burst
of
mental
agony
he
exclaimed
oh
how
horrible
it
is
to
love
and
yet
not
lose
one
s
keenness
of
perception
she
shook
her
head
with
a
gesture
of
anger
and
her
face
darkened
once
more
as
on
many
previous
occasions
hostility
had
risen
between
the
two
lovers
each
felt
hurt
by
the
injustice
of
suspicion
and
secretly
rebelled
with
that
restrained
anger
which
breaks
out
from
time
to
time
in
brutal
and
irrevocable
words
grave
accusations
and
absurd
recriminations
an
indescribable
fury
seized
them
to
torture
themselves
to
rend
and
martyrize
their
hearts
hippolyte
became
gloomy
and
silent
her
brows
were
knit
in
a
frown
and
her
lips
were
tightly
pressed
together
george
regarded
her
with
an
irritating
smile
yes
that
s
how
it
will
begin
he
repeated
still
smiling
his
disagreeable
smile
and
fixing
her
with
his
keen
glance
you
find
at
the
bottom
of
your
soul
an
inquietude
a
sort
of
vague
impatience
which
you
can
not
repress
when
near
me
you
feel
an
instinctive
repugnance
arise
in
your
breast
against
repugnance
which
you
can
not
subdue
and
then
you
become
taciturn
you
re
obliged
to
make
an
enormous
effort
to
speak
to
me
at
all
you
misunderstand
everything
i
say
and
perhaps
unconsciously
you
speak
crossly
even
about
the
most
trivial
things
she
did
not
interrupt
him
even
by
so
much
as
a
gesture
hurt
by
this
indifference
on
her
part
he
continued
to
reproach
her
spurred
on
to
torment
his
companion
not
only
by
his
sudden
fit
of
temper
but
also
by
a
certain
disinterested
taste
for
investigation
rendered
the
keener
and
the
more
literary
by
culture
he
always
tried
to
express
himself
with
the
accuracy
and
demonstrative
precision
which
the
works
of
the
analysts
had
taught
him
but
in
the
monologues
the
formulas
by
which
he
interpreted
his
inner
inquiry
exaggerated
and
modified
the
mental
condition
under
observation
while
in
the
dialogues
the
preoccupation
caused
by
being
perspicacious
often
obscured
the
sincerity
of
his
emotion
and
led
him
to
err
as
to
the
secret
motives
which
he
claimed
to
discover
in
others
his
brain
encumbered
by
a
mass
of
psychological
observations
personal
or
gathered
from
books
ended
by
confounding
and
confusing
everything
both
as
regarded
himself
and
others
he
continued
mind
you
i
make
no
reproach
i
know
it
is
not
your
fault
every
human
soul
has
but
a
fixed
quantity
of
sensitiveness
for
passion
it
is
inevitable
that
this
quantity
is
exhausted
in
time
and
that
no
power
can
prevent
the
cessation
of
passion
now
you
have
already
loved
me
for
a
long
two
years
it
will
be
the
second
anniversary
of
our
love
on
the
second
of
april
had
you
thought
of
it
she
nodded
he
repeated
as
if
to
himself
two
years
they
approached
a
bench
and
sat
down
hippolyte
sank
down
with
a
weary
sigh
as
if
overcome
by
an
enervating
weakness
the
heavy
black
coach
of
a
prelate
passed
by
on
the
road
below
the
wheels
rattling
on
the
uneven
cobblestones
the
faint
sound
of
a
bugle
came
from
the
flaminian
road
and
then
once
more
silence
regained
possession
of
the
surrounding
groves
a
few
drops
of
rain
fell
our
second
anniversary
will
be
dismal
he
went
on
without
pity
for
his
moody
companion
but
we
must
celebrate
it
all
the
same
i
have
a
fondness
for
bitter
fruits
hippolyte
revealed
her
sorrow
by
a
painful
smile
and
with
unexpected
gentleness
said
why
all
these
unkind
words
she
looked
long
and
searchingly
into
george
s
eyes
a
second
time
an
inexpressible
desire
to
read
each
other
s
hearts
seized
them
she
knew
well
the
horrible
malady
from
which
her
lover
suffered
she
knew
well
the
obscure
cause
of
all
his
acrimony
to
induce
him
to
talk
so
he
might
unburden
his
heart
she
added
what
ails
you
the
tenderness
of
her
tone
for
which
he
was
unprepared
threw
him
into
some
confusion
at
this
accent
he
knew
that
she
understood
him
and
pitied
him
and
he
felt
a
great
pity
for
himself
swell
in
his
bosom
a
profound
emotion
stirred
his
whole
being
what
ails
you
repeated
hippolyte
touching
his
hand
as
though
to
sensually
augment
the
power
of
her
tenderness
what
ails
me
he
echoed
i
love
the
aggressiveness
had
died
away
in
thus
expressing
his
incurable
weakness
he
commiserated
with
himself
on
his
own
malady
the
vague
rancor
which
had
ravaged
his
soul
appeared
to
be
dissipated
he
recognized
the
injustice
of
all
resentment
against
this
woman
because
he
recognized
a
superior
order
of
fatal
necessities
no
no
human
creature
caused
his
misery
it
arose
from
the
very
essence
of
life
he
had
to
complain
not
of
the
woman
he
loved
but
of
love
itself
love
towards
which
his
whole
being
reached
out
with
invincible
impetuosity
was
he
thought
the
greatest
of
human
sorrows
and
until
death
possibly
he
was
condemned
to
this
supreme
misfortune
as
he
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
hippolyte
asked
then
do
you
think
george
that
i
don
t
love
you
i
believe
that
you
love
me
now
he
answered
but
can
you
prove
to
me
that
or
in
a
month
or
in
a
year
you
will
still
be
happy
to
be
mine
can
you
prove
to
me
that
even
at
this
very
moment
you
are
wholly
mine
how
much
of
you
do
i
possess
everything
murmured
hippolyte
no
he
went
on
nothing
or
almost
nothing
and
i
do
not
possess
what
i
should
like
to
possess
you
are
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
like
every
other
human
being
you
conceal
within
yourself
a
world
which
is
impenetrable
to
me
and
to
which
no
depth
of
passion
can
give
me
access
of
your
sensations
your
sentiments
your
thoughts
i
know
but
a
small
part
speech
is
at
best
an
imperfect
sign
the
soul
is
incommunicable
you
can
not
show
me
your
soul
even
in
our
most
ecstatic
moments
we
are
two
always
strangers
lonely
at
heart
i
kiss
your
brow
and
beneath
that
brow
there
exists
possibly
a
thought
that
is
not
of
me
i
speak
to
you
and
what
i
say
perhaps
awakens
in
you
memories
of
other
days
and
not
of
my
love
a
man
passes
looks
at
you
and
in
your
heart
this
slight
fact
gives
rise
to
an
emotion
which
i
am
unable
to
detect
and
i
never
know
what
reflections
of
your
past
life
may
flash
upon
you
even
when
you
show
most
affection
for
me
ah
i
am
so
afraid
of
that
past
life
of
yours
i
am
by
your
side
i
feel
a
delicious
happiness
invade
my
being
a
happiness
which
at
certain
moments
results
from
your
presence
alone
i
caress
you
i
speak
to
you
i
listen
to
you
i
abandon
myself
entirely
all
at
once
a
thought
chills
me
if
without
being
aware
of
it
i
had
evoked
in
your
memory
the
phantom
of
a
former
sensation
melancholy
relic
of
days
never
can
i
describe
my
anguish
this
ardor
which
induces
in
me
the
illusory
feeling
of
i
know
not
what
communion
between
you
and
me
dies
out
all
at
once
you
escape
me
you
steal
away
you
become
inaccessible
and
i
remain
alone
in
frightful
solitude
ten
twenty
months
of
intimacy
are
all
as
nothing
you
seem
to
me
as
much
a
stranger
as
before
your
love
for
me
began
and
cease
to
caress
you
i
no
longer
speak
i
retire
within
myself
i
avoid
all
external
manifestation
i
dread
that
the
slightest
shock
should
raise
from
the
bottom
of
your
soul
the
obscure
dregs
deposited
there
by
irrevocable
life
and
then
there
fall
on
us
those
long
silences
full
of
anguish
in
which
the
energies
of
the
heart
are
uselessly
and
miserably
consumed
i
ask
you
of
what
are
you
thinking
and
you
reply
of
what
are
you
thinking
i
am
ignorant
of
your
thoughts
and
you
are
ignorant
of
mine
every
moment
the
distance
between
us
widens
until
finally
it
becomes
abysmal
but
objected
hippolyte
i
experience
no
such
feelings
i
give
you
more
of
myself
than
ever
i
think
my
love
is
stronger
this
affirmation
of
superiority
wounded
anew
the
invalid
you
think
too
much
she
continued
you
pay
too
much
attention
to
your
thoughts
possibly
i
have
less
attraction
for
you
than
your
thoughts
because
your
thoughts
are
always
different
always
new
while
now
i
have
nothing
that
is
new
to
offer
you
in
the
beginning
of
our
love
you
were
less
reflective
and
more
spontaneous
you
had
not
yet
developed
a
taste
for
the
bitter
things
in
life
you
were
more
lavish
with
your
kisses
than
with
your
words
if
as
you
say
speech
is
an
imperfect
sign
it
is
not
well
to
abuse
it
and
you
do
abuse
it
and
in
an
almost
always
cruel
manner
then
after
an
interval
of
silence
prompted
to
speak
by
something
he
said
she
yielded
to
the
temptation
to
express
herself
only
cadavers
are
dissected
but
scarcely
had
she
spoken
than
she
regretted
it
her
remark
struck
her
as
being
vulgar
unfeminine
and
acrimonious
she
was
sorry
she
had
not
preserved
that
gentle
and
indulgent
tone
which
had
moved
her
lover
so
strongly
a
few
moments
before
once
more
she
had
failed
in
her
resolution
to
be
to
him
the
most
patient
and
tender
of
nurses
you
see
she
said
repentantly
it
is
you
who
spoil
me
he
gave
a
faint
smile
both
understood
that
in
this
quarrel
their
love
only
had
been
wounded
the
prelate
s
carriage
repassed
the
two
black
horses
going
at
a
trot
in
the
atmosphere
which
the
haze
of
twilight
rendered
more
and
more
livid
the
trees
assumed
the
appearance
of
spectres
clouds
darkened
the
height
of
the
palatine
and
the
vatican
a
ray
of
light
yellow
as
sulphur
straight
as
a
sword
lightly
touched
mount
mario
behind
the
pointed
tops
of
the
does
she
still
love
me
george
thought
to
himself
why
is
she
so
easily
irritated
it
may
be
that
she
feels
that
i
speak
the
truth
or
at
least
what
will
soon
be
the
truth
irritation
is
a
symptom
but
am
i
not
conscious
of
a
constant
dull
irritation
in
myself
also
i
know
well
the
cause
of
my
irritation
i
am
jealous
of
what
of
everything
of
the
objects
reflected
in
her
eyes
he
looked
at
her
she
is
very
beautiful
she
is
pale
it
would
please
me
to
see
her
always
depressed
always
ill
when
her
color
returns
it
seems
to
me
as
if
it
were
no
longer
she
when
she
laughs
i
can
not
repress
a
vague
hostility
almost
anger
at
her
laugh
not
always
though
his
thoughts
died
away
in
the
shade
of
the
twilight
he
noticed
suddenly
how
much
the
appearance
of
the
evening
reminded
him
of
his
beloved
from
beneath
the
pallor
of
her
dark
face
a
light
effusion
shone
through
and
the
narrow
ribbon
of
an
exquisite
shade
of
yellow
which
she
wore
about
her
throat
disclosed
the
brown
marks
of
two
beauty
spots
she
is
very
beautiful
he
mused
the
expression
of
her
face
is
nearly
always
profound
expressive
passionate
therein
rests
the
secret
of
her
charm
her
beauty
never
tires
me
it
constantly
suggests
new
dreams
what
are
the
elements
of
this
beauty
i
can
not
say
materially
she
is
not
beautiful
sometimes
when
i
look
at
her
i
am
painfully
surprised
by
a
disillusion
that
is
because
i
then
see
only
her
physical
characteristics
her
face
is
not
transfigured
illumined
by
the
power
of
spiritual
expression
she
possesses
however
three
divine
elements
of
beauty
the
brow
the
eyes
and
the
mouth
yes
divine
her
laugh
came
to
his
mind
what
did
she
tell
me
yesterday
i
have
forgotten
what
it
was
some
humorous
incident
that
had
happened
at
milan
during
her
visit
to
her
sister
s
we
laughed
so
then
even
when
away
from
me
she
can
be
happy
yet
all
her
letters
which
i
have
treasured
are
full
of
sorrow
of
tears
of
hopeless
regrets
he
felt
as
if
he
had
received
a
wound
and
then
a
great
restlessness
came
upon
him
as
if
he
were
cognisant
of
a
serious
and
irreparable
fact
not
entirely
clear
to
him
the
ordinary
phenomena
of
sentimental
exaggeration
manifested
themselves
in
him
by
means
of
associated
images
this
simple
laugh
was
transformed
in
his
imagination
into
an
incessant
hilarity
daily
hourly
during
the
entire
period
of
her
absence
hippolyte
had
led
a
gay
commonplace
existence
with
people
unknown
to
him
among
the
companions
of
her
in
a
circle
of
stupid
admirers
her
sad
letters
were
only
lies
he
remembered
a
passage
in
one
letter
here
is
insupportable
friends
weary
us
constantly
and
do
not
leave
us
a
single
peaceful
hour
you
know
how
cordial
the
milanese
in
his
imagination
arose
a
vision
of
hippolyte
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
common
clerks
advocates
and
tradesmen
she
smiled
on
them
all
giving
her
hand
to
all
listening
to
witless
conversations
making
stupid
answers
sinking
herself
to
the
same
ordinary
level
and
then
there
fell
upon
his
heart
all
the
weight
of
the
misery
he
had
endured
for
the
past
two
years
at
the
thought
of
the
existence
his
mistress
led
and
the
unknown
world
in
which
she
passed
the
time
not
spent
with
him
what
does
she
do
whom
does
she
see
to
whom
does
she
speak
what
is
her
behavior
towards
people
who
visit
her
in
whose
life
she
is
a
factor
unanswerable
questions
he
thought
with
anguish
each
one
of
these
persons
takes
something
from
her
and
consequently
takes
something
from
me
i
shall
never
know
what
influence
these
people
have
over
her
the
emotions
and
thoughts
they
arouse
in
her
hippolyte
s
beauty
is
full
of
seductive
power
the
kind
of
beauty
which
torments
men
and
arouses
in
them
the
passion
of
desire
among
that
odious
crowd
she
must
have
been
frequently
desired
a
man
s
desire
is
discernible
in
his
look
and
the
look
is
free
and
the
woman
is
without
defence
against
the
look
of
the
man
who
desires
her
what
can
be
the
impression
of
a
woman
who
perceives
that
she
is
desired
she
certainly
can
not
remain
impassive
it
must
produce
in
her
a
feeling
of
disquietude
certainly
some
kind
of
emotion
if
only
one
of
repugnance
and
disgust
and
thus
the
first
man
who
comes
along
has
the
power
to
disturb
the
woman
who
loves
me
in
what
then
consists
my
possession
of
her
he
suffered
keenly
because
the
physical
pictures
bore
out
his
mental
reasoning
i
love
hippolyte
i
love
her
with
a
passion
which
i
should
judge
to
be
everlasting
did
i
not
know
that
all
human
passion
must
cease
at
some
time
i
love
her
and
i
can
not
imagine
keener
voluptuous
delights
than
those
she
gives
me
more
than
once
however
at
the
sight
of
some
passing
woman
i
have
been
seized
with
a
sudden
desire
more
than
once
has
the
flash
of
a
pair
of
feminine
eyes
thrown
me
into
a
melancholy
train
of
thought
more
than
once
i
have
dreamed
of
meeting
some
woman
perceived
in
a
or
the
mistress
of
a
friend
what
can
be
her
way
of
loving
of
what
does
its
voluptuous
secret
consist
and
for
some
time
this
woman
has
haunted
my
mind
not
indeed
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
thoughts
but
at
intervals
and
persistently
such
phantasies
suddenly
present
themselves
to
my
imagination
even
when
i
hold
hippolyte
in
my
arms
why
should
she
not
have
been
seized
by
desire
upon
sight
of
some
passing
man
had
i
the
gift
of
reading
her
soul
and
saw
it
traversed
by
such
a
desire
if
but
for
a
moment
i
should
without
the
slightest
doubt
consider
my
mistress
sullied
by
an
indelible
stain
and
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
die
of
grief
this
material
proof
i
can
never
have
because
the
soul
of
my
mistress
is
invisible
and
impalpable
this
however
does
not
prevent
the
soul
from
being
as
much
or
even
more
exposed
to
profanation
than
the
body
may
be
but
the
analogy
enlightens
me
the
possibility
is
certain
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
my
mistress
is
cognisant
of
a
recent
stain
upon
her
conscience
and
sees
this
stain
expand
beneath
her
contemplation
stunned
by
his
pain
he
started
violently
what
ails
what
are
you
thinking
asked
hippolyte
gently
of
you
he
replied
good
or
bad
bad
she
gave
a
sigh
and
then
said
shall
we
go
us
go
they
rose
and
regained
the
road
by
which
they
had
come
slowly
and
with
tearful
accents
hippolyte
murmured
what
a
sad
evening
o
my
love
and
she
stopped
as
if
to
recall
and
live
over
again
the
sorrows
scattered
through
the
day
that
was
about
to
close
around
them
now
the
pincio
was
deserted
full
of
silence
full
of
violet
shadows
in
which
the
busts
on
their
pedestals
took
on
the
appearance
of
funereal
monuments
below
the
city
was
covered
with
ashes
a
few
drops
of
rain
were
falling
where
shall
we
go
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
he
replied
dejectedly
what
i
shall
do
i
do
not
know
they
suffered
both
of
them
as
they
stood
side
by
side
and
they
thought
with
terror
of
a
greater
agony
which
awaited
them
well
known
and
far
more
horrible
torture
with
which
their
nocturnal
imaginations
would
rend
their
defenceless
souls
if
you
like
i
will
remain
with
you
said
hippolyte
timidly
devoured
by
a
secret
rancor
and
spurred
on
by
a
furious
desire
to
be
spiteful
and
resentful
george
replied
no
but
his
heart
protested
stay
far
from
her
you
can
not
no
you
can
not
and
in
spite
of
his
blind
hostile
impulses
the
conviction
of
this
impossibility
the
sure
knowledge
of
this
absolute
impossibility
gave
him
a
kind
of
internal
thrill
a
strange
thrill
of
exalted
pride
at
being
controlled
by
such
a
great
passion
he
repeated
to
himself
could
stay
away
from
her
no
i
could
not
and
he
felt
the
indefinable
sensation
of
being
dominated
by
an
unknown
power
a
tragic
breath
passed
over
his
being
george
cried
hippolyte
frightened
and
clinging
to
his
arm
he
started
he
recognized
the
spot
where
they
had
stopped
to
look
at
the
bloody
stain
left
by
the
suicide
are
you
afraid
he
asked
a
little
she
replied
still
holding
his
arm
he
disengaged
himself
from
this
restraint
and
approaching
the
parapet
leaned
over
darkness
had
already
enshrouded
the
street
below
but
he
believed
he
could
still
distinguish
the
blackish
spot
on
the
cobblestones
because
he
still
had
the
recent
picture
before
his
mind
the
deepening
twilight
seemed
to
suggest
and
create
a
phantom
corpse
the
indefinite
and
bloody
form
of
a
blond
young
man
who
was
this
man
why
did
he
kill
himself
in
this
phantom
he
seemed
to
recognize
his
own
form
rapid
incoherent
thoughts
coursed
through
his
brain
he
saw
as
by
a
lightning
flash
his
poor
uncle
demetrius
his
father
s
youngest
brother
also
a
face
covered
by
a
black
pall
resting
on
a
white
pillow
a
slender
pale
yet
virile
hand
and
a
small
silver
vessel
containing
holy
water
suspended
from
the
wall
by
three
small
chains
which
every
now
and
then
rattled
as
they
were
swung
by
the
breeze
suppose
i
threw
myself
over
a
leap
forward
a
rapid
fall
does
one
lose
consciousness
when
falling
through
space
he
imagined
the
shock
of
the
body
against
the
stones
and
he
shuddered
then
he
felt
in
all
his
limbs
a
violent
agonizing
repulsion
mingled
with
a
feeling
of
strange
lassitude
in
his
imagination
he
conjured
up
the
delights
of
the
coming
night
to
be
lulled
gradually
into
a
state
of
delicious
languor
to
awake
with
a
superabundance
of
tenderness
mysteriously
accumulated
during
one
s
sleep
fancies
and
ideas
followed
one
another
with
extraordinary
rapidity
when
he
turned
round
his
eyes
met
those
of
hippolyte
her
eyes
were
widely
dilated
and
fixed
upon
him
and
he
believed
he
could
read
in
their
depths
things
which
increased
his
pain
he
passed
his
arm
beneath
that
of
his
mistress
with
an
affectionate
gesture
customary
with
him
and
she
pressed
his
arm
firmly
against
her
heart
both
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
embrace
to
dissolve
one
into
the
other
distractedly
all
out
all
out
the
cry
of
the
keepers
resounded
among
the
groves
disturbing
the
silence
all
out
after
the
cry
the
silence
seemed
heavier
and
more
dismal
than
ever
and
these
few
words
vociferated
by
men
they
could
not
see
gave
the
two
lovers
an
insupportable
shock
to
show
that
they
had
heard
and
were
preparing
to
leave
they
hastened
their
step
but
here
and
there
in
the
deserted
paths
the
voices
obstinately
repeated
all
out
curse
their
cries
exclaimed
hippolyte
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
and
exasperation
and
increasing
the
rapidity
of
her
pace
the
clock
of
the
sounded
the
angelus
rome
appeared
similar
to
an
immense
grayish
formless
cloud
touching
the
earth
already
in
the
neighboring
houses
several
windows
were
lit
up
their
lights
enlarged
by
the
fog
a
few
drops
of
rain
were
falling
you
ll
come
to
me
won
t
you
asked
george
yes
yes
i
will
come
early
about
eleven
i
should
die
if
you
did
not
come
i
will
come
they
gazed
in
each
other
s
eyes
exchanging
an
intoxicating
promise
overcome
by
his
emotion
george
murmured
am
i
forgiven
they
looked
at
each
other
again
and
their
gaze
was
charged
with
caresses
adored
one
he
murmured
addio
she
rejoined
softly
think
of
me
until
eleven
addio
they
separated
at
the
foot
of
the
via
gregoriana
she
went
down
the
via
as
long
as
he
could
see
her
going
along
the
wet
pavement
lit
up
by
the
reflection
of
the
shop
windows
his
gaze
followed
her
thus
it
is
he
thought
she
leaves
me
she
enters
a
house
of
which
i
know
nothing
she
reënters
upon
her
commonplace
life
despoiled
of
all
the
ideality
in
which
i
have
clothed
her
she
becomes
another
woman
entirely
i
no
longer
know
her
the
gross
necessities
of
life
occupy
her
absorb
her
and
degrade
her
a
perfume
of
violets
was
carried
to
him
from
a
florist
s
close
by
and
his
heart
swelled
with
confused
aspirations
ah
why
is
it
not
permitted
us
to
conform
our
existence
according
to
our
dreams
and
to
live
forever
in
ourselves
alone
ii
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
george
was
still
buried
in
the
profound
and
refreshing
slumber
which
in
the
young
follows
a
night
of
voluptuousness
when
his
servant
entered
to
awaken
him
turning
in
his
bed
he
cried
i
am
at
home
to
no
one
let
me
be
but
from
the
adjoining
room
he
heard
the
importunate
visitor
s
voice
addressing
him
in
beseeching
accents
excuse
me
george
i
must
speak
to
you
george
recognized
the
voice
of
alphonso
exili
and
his
annoyance
was
only
the
greater
this
exili
was
a
college
chum
a
man
of
mediocre
intelligence
who
ruined
by
gambling
and
debauch
had
become
a
parasite
and
adventurer
he
still
appeared
a
handsome
young
man
in
spite
of
his
face
devastated
by
vice
yet
in
his
person
and
manners
there
was
that
indefinable
cunning
and
ignobleness
noticeable
in
persons
reduced
to
living
by
their
wits
he
entered
waited
until
the
servant
had
retired
and
assumed
a
distressed
air
then
swallowing
half
his
words
he
said
forgive
me
george
if
i
have
recourse
once
more
to
your
kindness
i
must
pay
a
card
debt
i
want
you
to
help
me
it
s
a
small
sum
only
three
hundred
lira
forgive
me
what
you
pay
your
card
debts
now
said
george
i
m
surprised
he
threw
this
insult
at
him
with
the
most
perfect
not
knowing
how
to
break
off
all
connection
with
the
parasite
he
treated
him
with
contempt
just
as
one
would
use
a
stick
to
ward
off
a
dirty
animal
exili
smiled
come
don
t
be
unkind
he
pleaded
in
supplicating
tones
like
a
woman
s
you
ll
give
me
the
three
hundred
lira
won
t
you
i
will
pay
you
back
on
my
word
of
honor
george
burst
into
laughter
he
pulled
the
bell
to
summon
the
servant
the
servant
entered
get
my
bunch
of
keys
out
of
those
clothes
there
on
the
sofa
the
servant
found
the
keys
open
the
second
drawer
give
me
the
large
the
servant
passed
him
the
very
well
you
may
go
couldn
t
you
let
me
have
four
hundred
lira
asked
exili
with
a
smile
when
the
servant
had
left
the
room
no
there
s
three
hundred
it
s
the
last
time
now
go
instead
of
handing
him
the
bills
george
laid
them
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
exili
smiled
took
them
and
placed
them
in
his
pocket
then
in
an
ambiguous
tone
in
which
irony
was
mixed
with
adulation
he
said
you
have
a
noble
heart
his
gaze
wandered
around
the
chamber
and
he
added
you
have
a
delicious
bedroom
he
seated
himself
on
the
sofa
poured
out
a
small
glass
of
liqueur
and
refilled
his
who
is
your
present
mistress
he
went
on
what
s
her
name
i
believe
it
s
no
longer
the
one
you
had
last
year
go
away
exili
i
want
to
sleep
what
a
splendid
creature
she
has
the
handsomest
eyes
in
rome
she
s
away
i
suppose
i
have
not
met
her
for
several
days
she
must
be
out
of
town
she
has
a
sister
in
milan
i
think
he
refilled
his
and
swallowed
its
contents
at
a
single
gulp
possibly
he
gossiped
only
in
order
to
gain
time
enough
to
empty
the
bottle
she
s
separated
from
her
husband
isn
t
she
he
continued
i
imagine
that
her
finances
must
be
at
a
very
low
ebb
and
yet
she
is
always
most
elegantly
dressed
about
two
months
ago
i
met
her
in
the
via
del
babuino
you
know
your
probable
successor
but
no
you
can
t
know
him
it
s
monti
the
di
a
great
big
fellow
with
dirty
blond
hair
that
very
day
i
saw
her
he
was
close
at
her
heels
in
the
via
del
babuino
you
know
one
can
see
at
a
glance
when
a
man
is
following
a
woman
monti
has
money
too
he
uttered
these
last
words
in
a
curious
tone
an
odious
tone
of
envy
and
cupidity
then
he
drank
for
the
third
time
noiselessly
are
you
asleep
george
instead
of
answering
george
pretended
to
sleep
he
had
heard
everything
but
he
feared
that
exili
might
see
his
through
the
bedclothes
george
he
feigned
to
start
like
a
man
suddenly
awakened
what
you
are
still
here
aren
t
you
going
i
am
going
look
a
pin
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
from
the
carpet
examined
it
with
curiosity
and
laid
it
on
the
coverlid
lucky
fellow
he
exclaimed
in
the
same
ambiguous
tone
and
now
thousand
thanks
he
extended
his
hand
but
george
kept
his
beneath
the
clothes
the
chatterbox
turned
towards
the
door
your
cognac
is
exquisite
i
ll
take
another
he
drank
and
then
went
away
george
in
his
bed
could
relish
the
poison
at
his
leisure
iii
the
second
anniversary
fell
on
the
second
of
april
this
time
said
hippolyte
we
will
celebrate
it
away
from
rome
we
must
pass
a
great
week
of
love
all
by
ourselves
no
matter
where
but
not
here
do
you
remember
the
first
anniversary
asked
george
that
of
last
year
yes
i
remember
it
was
a
sunday
easter
sunday
and
i
came
to
your
rooms
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
you
wore
that
little
english
jacket
that
pleased
me
so
you
had
brought
your
oh
that
morning
i
had
not
been
to
mass
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
my
departure
from
the
house
was
like
a
flight
answered
hippolyte
you
know
on
holy
days
i
could
not
call
a
moment
my
own
yet
for
all
that
i
found
a
way
to
remain
with
you
until
noon
and
we
had
guests
for
lunch
that
day
then
the
rest
of
the
day
we
could
not
see
each
other
it
was
a
sad
anniversary
yes
it
was
murmured
hippolyte
and
that
sun
and
that
forest
of
flowers
in
your
room
she
laughed
i
too
on
that
morning
had
gone
out
for
a
moment
i
bought
up
almost
the
entire
flower
market
you
threw
hands
full
of
at
me
you
put
a
number
of
the
leaves
down
my
neck
in
my
sleeves
do
you
remember
yes
i
remember
and
then
at
the
house
i
found
them
all
when
i
disrobed
she
smiled
and
on
my
return
my
husband
found
leaves
on
my
hat
in
the
folds
of
my
dress
yes
you
told
me
i
did
not
go
out
again
that
day
i
did
not
care
to
go
out
again
i
thought
and
rethought
yes
it
was
a
sad
anniversary
after
an
interval
of
silent
revery
she
spoke
again
did
you
believe
in
your
heart
that
we
should
reach
our
second
anniversary
he
replied
nor
i
what
love
thought
george
that
which
carries
within
itself
the
presentiment
of
its
end
he
then
thought
of
the
husband
without
hate
and
even
with
a
sort
of
compassionate
benevolence
now
she
is
free
why
then
am
i
more
uneasy
now
than
formerly
the
husband
was
a
sort
of
guarantee
for
me
i
looked
on
him
as
a
guardian
who
shielded
my
mistress
from
all
danger
maybe
these
are
illusions
because
at
that
time
also
i
suffered
much
but
the
suffering
which
is
passed
seems
always
less
severe
than
the
present
pain
following
his
own
reflections
he
no
longer
listened
to
hippolyte
s
words
well
she
said
where
shall
we
go
we
must
decide
is
the
first
of
april
i
have
already
said
to
my
mother
you
know
mamma
one
of
these
days
i
am
going
on
a
short
i
must
prepare
her
for
my
departure
do
not
worry
i
will
invent
a
plausible
pretext
leave
it
to
me
she
spoke
gayly
she
smiled
and
in
the
smile
which
illuminated
her
closing
remarks
he
believed
he
discovered
the
instinctive
contentment
which
a
woman
feels
when
concocting
some
deception
the
facility
with
which
hippolyte
succeeded
in
deceiving
her
mother
displeased
him
he
thought
once
more
and
not
without
regret
of
the
marital
vigilance
why
suffer
so
cruelly
on
account
of
this
liberty
he
reflected
when
it
is
in
the
service
of
my
pleasure
i
do
not
know
what
i
would
give
could
i
get
away
from
my
fixed
idea
from
my
suspicions
which
do
her
injustice
i
love
her
and
i
wrong
her
i
love
her
and
i
believe
her
capable
of
an
unworthy
action
we
must
not
go
too
far
she
said
you
ought
to
know
of
some
peaceful
spot
secluded
full
of
trees
interesting
not
tivoli
nor
frascati
take
the
s
there
on
the
look
let
us
look
together
she
took
the
red
book
knelt
close
to
the
couch
on
which
he
was
seated
and
with
pretty
gestures
and
infantile
grace
she
began
to
turn
over
the
pages
every
few
moments
she
read
a
few
lines
in
a
low
tone
he
sat
watching
her
fascinated
by
the
finesse
of
the
nape
of
her
neck
from
which
the
little
brown
curls
mounted
towards
the
crown
of
her
head
twisted
into
a
sort
of
coil
he
looked
at
the
two
little
brown
spots
beauty
spots
the
twins
placed
one
by
the
side
of
the
other
on
the
whiteness
of
the
velvety
neck
to
which
they
gave
an
ineffable
charm
he
remarked
that
she
wore
no
earrings
in
fact
for
two
or
three
days
she
had
not
worn
her
sapphire
earrings
has
she
sacrificed
them
on
account
of
some
money
embarrassment
who
knows
she
may
be
suffering
silently
from
the
cares
of
hard
daily
necessities
he
had
to
forcibly
compel
himself
to
consider
seriously
the
thought
which
haunted
him
this
thought
was
as
follows
when
she
becomes
tired
of
me
and
that
will
not
be
very
long
she
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
first
comer
who
will
offer
her
an
easy
life
and
who
in
exchange
for
sensual
pleasure
will
keep
her
from
want
this
man
may
even
be
the
of
whom
exili
spoke
disgusted
with
petty
miseries
she
will
triumph
over
the
other
disgust
she
will
adapt
herself
it
is
even
possible
that
she
will
not
have
to
overcome
any
repugnance
he
remembered
the
mistress
of
one
of
her
friends
the
countess
albertini
this
woman
separated
from
her
husband
left
free
without
fortune
had
descended
progressively
to
lucrative
having
enough
cleverness
to
save
appearances
he
remembered
a
second
example
which
illustrated
even
more
truly
the
possibility
of
what
he
feared
and
confronted
with
this
possibility
which
emerged
from
the
unfathomable
future
he
felt
an
inexpressible
pain
henceforth
his
apprehensions
would
give
him
no
truce
sooner
or
later
he
was
fated
to
witness
the
fall
of
the
creature
he
had
placed
so
high
life
was
full
of
such
forfeitures
i
have
found
nothing
she
said
in
a
disappointed
tone
gubbio
narni
viterbo
orvieto
look
at
the
map
of

the

she
read
in
a
tone
as
if
she
were
reciting
a
litany
all
at
once
she
began
to
laugh
threw
back
her
head
and
offered
her
beautiful
forehead
to
the
lips
of
her
lover
she
was
in
one
of
those
moments
of
expanding
kindness
which
gave
her
the
air
of
a
young
girl
what
a
number
of
monasteries
how
many
convents
it
must
be
a
strange
place
shall
we
go
to
orvieto
george
experienced
a
sensation
as
if
his
soul
had
been
overwhelmed
by
a
sudden
wave
of
freshness
he
abandoned
himself
with
gratitude
to
this
comforting
sign
and
as
he
pressed
his
lips
to
hippolyte
s
brow
he
gathered
there
the
souvenir
of
the
city
of
the
guelphs
of
the
deserted
city
which
is
silent
in
mute
adoration
of
its
marvellous
duomo
orvieto
were
you
never
there
imagine
to
yourself
at
the
top
of
a
rock
of
tufa
overlooking
a
melancholy
valley
a
city
so
perfectly
silent
as
to
seem
without
inhabitants
shutters
closed
gray
lanes
in
which
the
grass
grows
a
capuchin
monk
crossing
a
public
square
a
bishop
descending
from
a
black
carriage
in
front
of
some
hospital
with
a
decrepit
domestic
at
the
a
tower
against
a
white
and
rainy
sky
a
clock
slowly
tolling
the
hours
and
all
at
once
at
the
bottom
of
a
street
a
duomo
what
peace
murmured
hippolyte
rather
dreamily
as
if
she
had
before
her
eyes
the
vision
of
this
silent
city
i
have
seen
orvieto
in
february
he
went
on
when
the
weather
was
like
few
drops
of
rain
a
few
beams
of
sunshine
i
stayed
there
one
day
and
i
was
sorry
to
leave
i
brought
away
with
me
a
feeling
of
nostalgia
for
that
peace
oh
what
peace
i
had
no
other
companion
than
myself
and
i
indulged
in
this
dream
to
have
a
mistress
or
to
express
it
better
a
who
would
be
full
of
devotion
and
to
come
here
to
live
here
for
a
month
a
long
april
month
a
rather
rainy
april
ashen
but
mild
with
showers
of
sunshine
to
pass
hours
and
hours
in
or
before
or
about
the
cathedral
to
gather
roses
in
the
convents
gardens
to
visit
the
houses
of
the
sisters
to
get
preserves
to
drink
delicious
perfumed
liqueurs
from
small
etruscan
cups
to
love
a
great
deal
and
sleep
a
great
deal
in
a
soft
bed
all
veiled
in
virginal
this
dream
made
hippolyte
smile
with
happiness
putting
on
an
innocent
expression
she
said
i
am
pious
you
know
will
you
take
me
to
orvieto
and
huddling
at
her
lover
s
feet
she
took
both
his
hands
in
hers
an
immense
joy
invaded
her
whole
being
she
had
already
a
foretaste
of
the
promised
repose
idleness
melancholy
tell
me
again
he
kissed
her
forehead
lingering
over
it
with
chaste
emotion
then
for
a
long
time
he
regarded
her
caressingly
your
forehead
is
so
beautiful
he
said
with
a
little
thrill
at
that
moment
the
real
hippolyte
corresponded
with
the
ideal
hippolyte
which
lived
in
his
heart
he
beheld
her
beautiful
tender
submissive
breathing
a
noble
and
sweet
poesy
according
to
the
motto
he
had
invested
her
with
she
was
grave
and
dum
tell
me
again
she
murmured
a
soft
light
entered
from
the
balcony
from
time
to
time
the
windows
rattled
gently
under
the
breeze
and
the
raindrops
pattered
almost
noiselessly
on
the
panes
iv
since
we
have
already
enjoyed
in
imagination
the
essence
of
pleasure
since
we
have
tasted
all
that
our
sensations
and
sentiments
could
experience
of
what
is
rarest
and
most
delicate
i
would
advise
that
we
renounce
the
experience
of
reality
don
t
let
us
go
to
orvieto
and
he
chose
another
place
george
was
not
acquainted
with
albano
nor
ariccia
nor
the
lake
of
nemi
hippolyte
during
her
infancy
had
been
taken
to
albano
to
the
house
of
an
aunt
now
dead
for
him
this
trip
would
have
the
charm
of
the
unknown
and
for
her
it
would
evoke
the
souvenir
of
days
long
distant
does
it
not
seem
as
if
a
new
vision
of
beauty
renews
and
purifies
love
do
not
the
memories
of
the
virginal
age
embalm
the
heart
with
a
perfume
always
fresh
and
soothing
they
decided
to
leave
on
the
second
of
april
at
noon
by
train
both
were
punctual
at
the
rendezvous
at
the
station
and
when
they
found
themselves
amidst
the
crowd
they
felt
a
restless
joy
penetrate
their
souls
shan
t
we
be
seen
tell
me
shan
t
we
be
seen
asked
hippolyte
and
and
imagining
that
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
how
much
longer
before
we
start
dio
mio
how
afraid
i
am
they
hoped
to
have
a
compartment
to
themselves
but
to
their
great
regret
they
were
forced
to
resign
themselves
to
having
three
travelling
companions
george
saluted
a
gentleman
and
lady
who
is
that
asked
hippolyte
leaning
towards
her
lover
s
ear
i
will
tell
you
she
examined
the
couple
with
curiosity
the
gentleman
was
an
old
man
with
a
long
venerable
beard
a
broad
bald
yellowish
head
marked
in
the
centre
by
a
deep
depression
a
sort
of
enormous
and
deformed
navel
like
the
imprint
which
would
be
caused
by
a
large
finger
pressed
into
a
soft
substance
the
lady
wrapped
in
a
persian
shawl
showed
under
a
bonnet
fashioned
like
a
an
emaciated
and
meditative
face
and
in
her
dress
as
in
her
physiognomy
could
be
found
something
of
the
english
caricatures
of
the
the
watery
eyes
of
the
elderly
man
had
however
a
singular
vivacity
they
seemed
illumined
by
an
internal
fire
like
those
of
an
ecstatic
he
had
acknowledged
george
s
bow
by
a
very
amiable
smile
hippolyte
racked
her
memory
where
could
she
have
met
these
two
persons
she
could
not
succeed
in
refreshing
her
memory
but
she
had
a
confused
feeling
that
these
strange
old
people
had
been
involved
in
one
of
her
who
is
it
tell
me
she
repeated
in
a
whisper
the
martlet
and
his
wife
they
will
bring
us
good
luck
do
you
know
where
we
first
met
them
no
but
i
am
sure
that
i
have
seen
them
somewhere
it
was
in
the
chapel
in
the
via
belsiana
on
april
the
when
i
first
knew
you
ah
yes
i
remember
her
eyes
lighted
up
the
coincidence
seemed
marvellous
to
her
she
examined
anew
the
two
old
people
and
felt
a
kind
of
emotion
what
a
good
augury
a
delicious
melancholy
came
over
her
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
back
of
the
seat
and
thought
once
more
of
bygone
days
she
saw
again
the
little
church
in
the
via
belsiana
mysterious
shrouded
in
a
bluish
penumbra
the
gallery
which
had
a
curve
like
a
balcony
the
posy
of
young
girls
chanting
in
the
choir
below
the
group
of
musicians
with
their
string
instruments
standing
in
front
of
pulpits
roundabout
in
the
stalls
of
oak
the
seated
auditors
few
in
number
almost
all
gray
or
bald
the
beat
the
time
a
pious
perfume
of
incense
and
violets
mingled
with
the
music
of
sebastian
bach
overcome
by
the
suavity
of
her
recollections
she
leaned
over
more
towards
her
lover
and
murmured
are
you
thinking
of
the
old
days
too
she
would
have
liked
to
be
able
to
communicate
her
emotions
in
order
to
prove
to
him
that
she
had
forgotten
nothing
not
even
the
slightest
circumstance
of
that
solemn
event
he
with
a
furtive
gesture
sought
hippolyte
s
hand
beneath
the
large
folds
of
their
travelling
rug
and
kept
it
slightly
pressed
in
his
own
both
felt
in
their
souls
a
thrill
which
recalled
to
them
certain
delicate
sensations
of
the
first
days
of
their
love
and
they
remained
in
this
attitude
pensive
somewhat
exalted
somewhat
lethargic
from
the
warmth
soothed
by
the
even
and
continuous
movement
of
the
train
at
times
seeing
a
landscape
in
the
haze
through
the
carriage
windows
the
sky
was
clouded
it
was
raining
martlet
dozed
in
a
corner
martlet
was
reading
a
the
third
traveller
slept
soundly
his
cap
down
over
his
eyes
if
the
choir
missed
the
martlet
beat
time
with
energy
like
the
at
a
certain
moment
all
the
old
men
beat
time
as
if
moved
by
the
spirit
of
the
music
there
was
in
the
air
an
evaporated
perfume
of
incense
and
violets
george
abandoned
himself
with
delight
to
the
capricious
workings
of
his
memory
could
i
have
dreamed
of
a
stranger
or
more
poetic
prelude
to
my
love
it
seems
like
a
recollection
of
some
romantic
tale
yet
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
souvenir
of
my
actual
life
i
constantly
retain
the
smallest
details
of
it
before
the
eyes
of
my
soul
the
poetry
of
this
beginning
shed
later
on
the
shadow
of
a
dream
over
my
entire
love
in
the
drowsiness
of
a
light
torpor
he
dwelt
on
certain
confused
images
which
exerted
a
species
of
musical
fascination
over
his
mind
a
few
grains
of
little
bouquet
of
violets
look
how
martlet
sleeps
said
hippolyte
in
a
whisper
as
peacefully
as
an
infant
then
she
added
smiling
you
too
are
sleepy
are
you
not
it
is
still
raining
what
a
strange
languor
my
eyelids
feel
so
heavy
her
eyes
she
looked
at
him
from
between
her
long
eyelashes
george
thought
to
himself
her
eyelashes
pleased
me
at
once
she
was
in
the
centre
of
the
chapel
seated
on
a
bench
her
profile
was
delineated
in
the
light
streaming
from
the
window
when
the
clouds
outside
cleared
away
the
light
suddenly
grew
stronger
she
made
a
slight
movement
and
in
the
light
i
saw
the
real
length
of
her
prodigious
length
tell
me
said
hippolyte
will
it
be
long
before
we
arrive
the
shrill
whistle
of
the
locomotive
announced
the
proximity
of
a
station
i
ll
wager
she
added
that
we
have
gone
beyond
our
station
oh
no
very
well
inquire
cried
a
hoarse
voice
on
the
platform
george
somewhat
startled
stretched
out
his
head
and
asked
is
this
albano
no
sir
this
is
answered
the
man
with
a
smile
are
you
going
to
albano
then
you
should
have
alighted
at
cecchina
hippolyte
burst
into
such
a
loud
peal
of
laughter
that
and
martlet
looked
at
her
with
amazement
george
immediately
joined
in
the
contagious
hilarity
what
shall
we
do
first
of
all
we
must
get
out
of
this
train
george
handed
their
to
a
porter
while
hippolyte
continued
to
fresh
hearty
at
this
misadventure
which
she
considered
capital
fun
martlet
looked
startled
at
this
outburst
of
youth
which
seemed
to
him
like
a
wave
of
sunshine
but
he
smiled
with
benevolent
condescension
and
bowed
to
hippolyte
who
at
heart
felt
a
vague
regret
at
leaving
the
train
poor
mr
martlet
she
said
half
in
earnest
half
in
jest
as
she
watched
the
train
moving
away
through
the
bleak
and
deserted
country
i
am
sorry
to
part
with
him
who
knows
if
i
shall
ever
meet
him
again
then
turning
towards
george
she
added
what
now
a
railway
employee
gave
them
information
the
train
for
cecchina
passes
here
at
four
we
can
manage
then
continued
hippolyte
it
is
now
two
now
from
this
moment
i
declare
that
i
will
assume
the
management
of
this
journey
you
will
simply
permit
yourself
to
be
conducted
come
my
little
george
keep
close
to
me
and
take
good
care
that
you
don
t
lose
yourself
she
spoke
to
him
as
to
a
baby
in
jest
they
both
felt
full
of
gayety
where
is
segni
where
is
paliano
no
village
could
be
seen
in
the
neighborhood
the
low
hills
spread
their
uncertain
verdure
beneath
a
gray
sky
near
the
road
a
single
little
tree
knotted
and
gnarled
swayed
in
the
humid
atmosphere
as
it
still
poured
the
two
wanderers
sought
shelter
at
the
station
in
a
small
room
with
a
without
a
fire
on
a
wall
hung
an
old
map
in
tatters
its
surface
a
network
of
black
lines
on
another
wall
hung
a
square
of
pasteboard
advertising
an
elixir
opposite
to
the
chimney
which
had
not
even
the
memory
of
a
fire
a
couch
covered
with
a
waxed
cloth
was
losing
its
species
of
stuffing
by
a
thousand
wounds
look
cried
hippolyte
who
was
reading
the
at
segni
there
is
the
gaetanino
hostelry
this
designation
made
them
laugh
suppose
we
smoke
a
cigarette
said
george
it
is
three
o
clock
it
was
at
this
time
that
i
entered
the
church
two
years
ago
and
once
more
the
memory
of
the
great
day
occupied
his
mind
during
several
minutes
they
smoked
without
speaking
listening
to
the
rain
which
had
increased
in
force
through
the
drenched
they
saw
the
frail
little
tree
twisting
and
bending
under
the
squall
my
love
is
of
older
date
than
yours
said
george
it
was
born
before
that
day
she
protested
he
fascinated
by
the
profound
charm
of
the
days
irrevocably
passed
continued
tenderly
i
can
see
you
again
as
you
passed
the
first
time
what
an
ineffaceable
impression
it
was
towards
evening
when
the
lights
begin
to
be
lit
when
waves
of
azure
fall
on
the
streets
i
was
alone
before
the
windows
of
alinari
i
was
looking
at
the
figures
but
distinguished
them
with
difficulty
it
was
an
indefinable
lassitude
much
sadness
with
i
know
not
what
vague
desire
for
ideality
that
evening
i
had
an
ardent
thirst
for
poetry
elevation
refined
and
spiritual
things
was
it
a
presentiment
he
made
a
long
pause
but
hippolyte
said
nothing
waiting
for
him
to
continue
engrossed
in
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
listening
to
him
among
the
light
smoke
of
the
cigarettes
which
seemed
to
envelop
the
veiled
memories
in
still
another
veil
it
was
in
february
i
was
paying
a
visit
to
orvieto
at
that
very
time
i
even
believe
that
if
i
was
then
at
alinari
s
it
was
to
ask
him
for
a
photograph
of
the
reliquary
and
you
passed
since
then
on
two
or
three
other
or
three
not
have
seen
you
as
pale
that
singular
pallor
you
can
not
imagine
hippolyte
how
pale
you
were
never
have
i
seen
its
equal
i
thought
how
can
that
woman
keep
up
she
can
not
have
a
single
drop
of
blood
in
her
it
was
a
supernatural
pallor
which
in
the
flood
of
azure
falling
from
the
sky
to
the
pavement
gave
you
the
appearance
of
a
creature
without
a
body
i
paid
no
attention
to
the
man
who
accompanied
you
i
did
not
wish
to
follow
you
i
did
not
receive
even
as
much
as
a
look
from
you
i
recall
another
detail
you
stopped
a
few
steps
farther
on
because
a
blocked
the
pavement
ah
i
still
see
in
the
air
the
scintillation
of
the
small
flame
at
the
summit
of
the
staff
i
see
the
sudden
lighting
of
the
gas
which
bathed
you
in
light
hippolyte
smiled
but
somewhat
sadly
with
that
sadness
which
oppresses
the
heart
of
women
when
they
regard
their
portraits
taken
in
former
days
yes
i
was
pale
she
said
i
had
only
quitted
my
bed
a
few
weeks
before
after
a
three
months
illness
i
had
been
at
death
s
door
a
gust
of
rain
dashed
against
the
the
little
tree
could
be
seen
bending
and
twisting
under
the
wind
in
an
almost
circular
movement
as
if
some
hand
were
attempting
to
uproot
it
for
several
minutes
they
both
watched
the
fury
of
the
elements
which
in
the
bleakness
nakedness
and
inert
torpor
of
the
surrounding
country
took
on
a
strange
appearance
of
conscious
life
hippolyte
felt
almost
compassion
the
imaginary
suffering
of
the
tree
placed
them
face
to
face
with
their
own
sufferings
they
mentally
considered
the
great
solitude
which
lay
all
around
the
station
a
miserable
hut
before
which
passed
from
time
to
time
a
of
divers
travellers
each
of
whom
carried
in
his
own
bosom
a
different
inquietude
sad
images
rapidly
succeeded
one
another
in
their
thoughts
suggested
by
the
same
things
they
had
seen
an
hour
before
with
joyous
eyes
and
when
the
images
faded
away
when
their
consciences
ceasing
to
be
impressed
returned
to
themselves
again
they
both
found
at
the
bottom
of
their
being
a
unique
and
inexpressible
regret
for
days
irrevocably
lost
their
love
had
behind
it
a
long
it
dragged
behind
it
through
the
years
an
immense
and
obscure
net
full
of
dead
things
what
s
the
matter
asked
hippolyte
her
voice
slightly
changed
what
s
the
matter
with
you
asked
george
looking
fixedly
at
her
neither
replied
to
the
question
they
remained
silent
and
renewed
their
gaze
through
the
windows
the
heavens
seemed
to
smile
tearfully
a
faint
glimmer
lit
up
a
hillock
bathed
it
in
a
fugitive
golden
glow
died
away
other
tried
to
pierce
the
then
disappeared
hippolyte
sanzio
said
george
pronouncing
the
name
slowly
as
if
to
enjoy
its
charm
how
my
heart
beat
when
i
finally
learned
that
was
your
name
how
many
things
have
i
seen
and
felt
in
that
name
it
was
the
name
of
one
of
my
sisters
who
is
dead
that
beautiful
name
was
familiar
to
me
with
profound
emotion
i
immediately
thought
oh
if
my
lips
could
only
resume
their
dear
that
day
from
morning
until
night
the
recollections
of
my
dead
sister
mingled
exquisitely
with
my
secret
dream
i
did
not
go
in
search
of
you
i
forbade
myself
such
pursuit
i
would
never
be
importunate
yet
at
heart
i
had
an
inexplicable
confidence
i
was
sure
that
sooner
or
later
you
would
know
me
and
love
me
what
delicious
sensations
were
mine
i
lived
outside
of
the
reality
my
soul
fed
only
on
music
and
exalting
books
one
day
it
happened
that
i
saw
you
at
a
concert
given
by
gian
sgambati
but
i
saw
you
only
just
as
you
were
about
to
leave
the
hall
you
gave
me
a
glance
another
time
again
you
looked
at
you
remember
it
was
when
we
met
at
the
entrance
to
the
via
del
babuino
opposite
the
piale
library
yes
i
remember
you
had
a
little
girl
with
you
yes
of
my
nieces
i
stopped
on
the
as
to
allow
you
to
pass
i
noticed
that
we
were
both
of
the
same
height
you
were
less
pale
than
usual
a
momentary
feeling
of
pride
flashed
through
me
you
had
guessed
correctly
said
hippolyte
you
remember
it
was
towards
the
end
of
march
i
waited
with
growing
confidence
i
lived
from
day
to
day
absorbed
in
thoughts
of
the
great
passion
which
i
felt
approaching
as
i
had
seen
you
twice
with
a
small
bouquet
of
violets
i
filled
all
my
house
with
violets
oh
that
beginning
of
spring
i
shall
never
forget
and
the
morning
slumbers
so
light
so
transparent
and
those
slow
dreamy
awakenings
in
which
while
my
eyes
were
becoming
used
to
the
light
my
mind
still
delayed
before
resuming
the
sentiment
of
reality
i
recall
that
certain
childish
artifices
sufficed
to
throw
me
into
a
species
of
illusionary
intoxication
i
remember
one
day
at
a
concert
while
listening
to
a
beethoven
sonata
in
which
a
frequent
and
periodic
return
of
a
sublime
and
passionate
phrase
recurred
i
exalted
myself
almost
to
a
state
of
madness
by
the
interior
repetition
of
a
poetical
phrase
in
which
your
name
occurred
hippolyte
smiled
but
hearing
him
speak
with
an
evident
preference
for
all
the
first
manifestations
of
his
love
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
felt
displeased
did
those
days
seem
sweeter
to
him
than
the
those
distant
recollections
his
dearest
recollections
george
went
on
all
the
disdain
which
i
have
for
a
commonplace
existence
would
never
have
sufficed
to
inspire
me
with
the
dream
of
an
asylum
as
fantastic
and
mysterious
as
the
abandoned
oratory
of
the
via
belsiana
do
you
recall
it
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
steps
opening
on
the
street
was
shut
and
had
been
for
years
perhaps
one
passed
through
a
side
alley
which
reeked
of
wine
and
in
which
there
was
the
red
sign
of
a
cabaret
with
a
large
cork
do
you
remember
it
the
entrance
was
at
the
rear
and
one
had
to
pass
through
a
sacristy
scarcely
large
enough
to
hold
a
priest
and
sacristan
it
was
the
entrance
to
the
sanctuary
of
wisdom
what
old
men
and
women
on
all
sides
in
the
stalls
where
had
alexander
memmi
been
to
procure
his
audience
doubtless
you
did
not
know
dear
one
that
you
personified
beauty
in
this
council
of
the
martlet
you
see
is
one
of
the
most
confirmed
buddhists
of
our
epoch
and
his
wife
has
written
a
book
on
the
of
the
lady
seated
near
you
was
margherita
traube
boll
a
celebrated
doctor
who
is
carrying
on
her
defunct
husband
s
investigations
into
the
visual
functions
the
necromancer
in
the
long
greenish
cloak
who
entered
on
tiptoe
was
a
german
physician
fleichl
a
superb
pianist
a
fanatic
on
bach
the
priest
seated
beneath
the
cross
was
count
castracane
an
immortal
botanist
another
botanist
a
bacteriologist
a
microscopist
named
cuboni
was
sitting
in
front
of
him
and
there
was
also
jacopo
moleschott
that
unforgettable
old
man
frank
enormous
also
blaserna
the
collaborator
of
helmholtz
in
the
theory
of
sound
and
davys
a
philosophical
painter
a
preraphaelite
plunged
into
brahmanism
the
others
less
numerous
were
all
superior
people
rare
minds
given
to
the
highest
speculations
of
modern
science
cold
investigators
of
life
and
passionate
adorers
of
dreams
he
interrupted
himself
in
order
to
conjure
up
the
picture
and
then
went
on
these
savants
listened
to
the
music
with
religious
enthusiasm
one
assumed
an
inspired
attitude
others
made
unconscious
gestures
in
imitation
of
the
others
in
low
tones
joined
in
chant
with
the
choir
the
choir
of
men
and
women
occupied
the
rostrum
the
painted
wood
of
which
still
showed
traces
of
gilding
in
front
the
young
girls
formed
a
group
with
their
partitions
kept
on
a
level
with
their
faces
below
on
the
roughly
made
stands
of
the
violinists
burned
candles
spots
of
gold
on
a
dark
blue
background
here
and
there
their
small
flames
were
reflected
by
the
varnished
body
of
an
instrument
put
a
luminous
point
on
the
tip
of
a
bow
alexander
memmi
somewhat
stiff
bald
with
a
short
black
beard
and
gold
spectacles
kept
time
with
severe
and
sober
gestures
at
the
close
of
every
piece
a
murmur
arose
in
the
chapel
and
laughs
badly
suppressed
descended
from
the
gallery
amidst
the
rustling
of
being
turned
when
the
sky
brightened
the
grew
pale
and
a
cross
very
high
up
which
had
figured
in
former
years
in
solemn
processions
a
cross
all
ornamented
with
golden
olives
and
foliage
seemed
as
if
detached
from
the
wall
in
a
burst
of
light
the
white
and
bald
heads
of
the
auditors
shone
on
the
oaken
backs
then
all
at
once
by
a
new
change
in
the
sky
the
shadow
again
began
to
creep
among
these
things
like
a
light
mist
a
scarcely
perceptible
wave
of
some
subtle
or
benzoin
the
nave
on
the
single
altar
in
glass
vases
two
bouquets
of
violets
somewhat
faded
exhaled
the
breath
of
spring
and
this
perfume
was
like
the
poesy
of
dreams
which
the
music
evoked
in
the
souls
of
the
old
men
while
close
by
in
quite
different
souls
there
developed
another
dream
like
an
aurora
on
melting
snows
it
pleased
him
to
reconstruct
this
scene
to
render
it
warm
it
again
with
lyric
breath
is
it
not
preposterous
unbelievable
he
cried
at
rome
in
the
city
of
intellectual
inertia
a
master
of
music
a
buddhist
who
has
published
two
volumes
of
essays
on
the
philosophy
of
schopenhauer
indulges
in
the
luxury
of
having
a
mass
by
sebastian
bach
executed
for
his
own
pleasure
in
a
mysterious
chapel
before
an
audience
of
great
savants
whose
daughters
sing
in
the
chorus
is
it
not
a
page
from
hoffmann
on
an
afternoon
of
a
somewhat
gray
but
warm
old
philosophers
quit
their
laboratories
where
they
have
obstinately
striven
to
wrest
from
life
one
of
its
secrets
and
they
assemble
in
a
hidden
oratory
in
order
to
satisfy
almost
to
intoxication
the
passion
that
has
drawn
together
their
hearts
to
leave
their
earthly
bodies
and
live
ideally
in
dreams
and
in
the
midst
of
this
old
men
s
gathering
an
exquisite
musical
idyll
unfolds
between
the
cousin
of
the
buddhist
and
the
friend
of
the
buddhist
ideally
speaking
and
when
the
mass
is
finished
the
buddhist
suspecting
nothing
presents
the
future
lover
to
the
divine
hippolyte
sanzio
he
began
to
laugh
and
then
arose
i
have
made
it
seems
to
me
a
commemoration
according
to
rule
for
an
instant
hippolyte
remained
somewhat
absorbed
then
she
said
do
you
remember
it
was
on
a
saturday
the
eve
of
palm
sunday
she
also
arose
approached
george
and
kissed
his
cheek
shall
we
go
now
it
is
no
longer
raining
they
went
out
and
strolled
along
the
wet
pavement
which
reflected
the
subdued
sunlight
the
cold
air
made
them
shiver
roundabout
the
undulating
hills
were
covered
with
verdure
and
furrowed
with
luminous
streaks
here
an
there
large
pools
of
water
reflected
the
pale
image
of
a
sky
whose
deep
azure
spread
out
between
the
flaky
clouds
the
little
tree
dripping
with
rain
was
illumined
at
intervals
that
little
tree
will
remain
as
one
of
our
remembrances
said
hippolyte
stopping
to
look
at
it
it
is
so
lonely
so
lonely
the
bell
announced
the
approach
of
the
train
it
was
a
quarter
past
four
a
railway
employee
offered
to
get
their
tickets
when
shall
we
arrive
at
albano
george
asked
about
seven
o
clock
it
will
be
night
said
hippolyte
as
she
felt
rather
cold
she
took
george
s
arm
and
she
was
pleased
to
think
that
they
would
arrive
at
a
strange
hotel
this
chilly
evening
and
that
they
would
dine
alone
before
a
bright
fire
george
perceived
that
she
trembled
and
asked
do
you
wish
to
go
in
again
no
she
replied
you
see
the
sun
s
coming
out
i
shall
warm
up
an
indefinable
desire
for
intimacy
had
seized
her
she
pressed
closely
to
him
became
suddenly
caressing
and
her
voice
look
contact
all
her
full
of
seduction
she
wished
to
shed
over
the
loved
one
the
most
feminine
of
her
charms
she
wished
to
intoxicate
him
to
dazzle
him
with
a
display
of
present
happiness
capable
of
eclipsing
the
reflection
of
bygone
happiness
she
wished
to
appear
to
him
more
amiable
more
adorable
more
desirable
than
ever
before
a
fear
assailed
atrocious
he
might
regret
the
woman
of
long
ago
sigh
for
the
vanished
delights
believe
that
then
only
had
he
attained
the
height
of
intoxication
his
recollections
she
thought
have
filled
my
soul
with
so
much
melancholy
i
have
restrained
my
tears
with
difficulty
and
he
too
perhaps
is
sad
at
heart
how
heavily
the
past
hangs
over
our
love
perhaps
he
is
tired
of
me
perhaps
he
is
unaware
of
this
weariness
and
does
not
avow
it
to
himself
willing
to
live
under
the
illusion
but
he
is
perhaps
incapable
now
of
finding
any
happiness
in
me
if
i
am
still
dear
to
him
it
is
perhaps
only
because
he
recognizes
in
me
an
object
for
his
dear
sorrows
alas
i
too
when
with
him
taste
true
happiness
only
at
rare
intervals
i
suffer
too
and
yet
i
love
him
and
i
love
my
suffering
and
my
only
desire
is
to
please
him
and
i
can
not
imagine
life
without
this
love
why
then
are
we
so
sad
since
we
love
one
another
she
leaned
heavily
on
her
lover
s
arm
gazing
at
him
with
eyes
to
which
the
shadow
of
her
thoughts
imparted
an
expression
of
profound
tenderness
two
years
ago
about
the
same
hour
we
left
the
chapel
together
and
he
spoke
to
me
of
things
in
no
way
connected
with
love
in
a
voice
which
moved
my
heart
which
touched
my
soul
as
if
with
a
caress
of
the
lips
and
this
ideal
caress
i
enjoyed
like
a
long
kiss
i
trembled
i
trembled
incessantly
because
i
felt
an
unknown
feeling
born
in
me
oh
it
was
a
divine
hour
we
have
reached
our
second
anniversary
and
we
still
love
one
another
just
now
he
spoke
and
if
his
voice
affected
me
differently
than
it
used
to
do
it
still
moves
me
to
the
bottom
of
my
soul
we
have
before
us
a
delightful
evening
why
regret
the
days
that
are
gone
our
liberty
our
present
intimacy
are
they
not
worth
the
incertitude
and
hesitations
of
that
time
even
our
memories
so
numerous
do
they
not
add
a
new
charm
to
our
love
i
love
give
myself
up
to
him
entirely
in
the
presence
of
his
desire
i
no
longer
know
modesty
in
two
years
he
has
transformed
me
he
has
made
of
me
another
woman
he
has
given
me
new
senses
a
new
soul
a
new
intelligence
i
am
creation
he
can
intoxicate
himself
through
me
as
he
would
through
one
of
his
own
thoughts
i
belong
entirely
to
him
now
and
forever
then
passionately
pressing
her
form
against
his
she
asked
are
you
not
happy
the
tone
in
which
she
spoke
moved
him
and
as
if
suddenly
enveloped
by
a
warm
breath
he
experienced
a
thrill
of
real
happiness
yes
i
am
happy
he
answered
and
when
the
locomotive
whistle
was
heard
their
hearts
had
the
same
palpitation
at
last
they
were
alone
in
their
compartment
she
closed
all
the
windows
waited
until
the
train
was
again
in
motion
they
fell
into
each
other
s
arms
kissed
each
other
and
repeated
all
the
caressing
names
which
their
tenderness
of
the
last
two
years
had
used
then
they
sat
still
side
by
side
a
vague
smile
on
their
lips
and
in
their
eyes
and
with
the
sensation
that
little
by
little
the
rapid
coursing
of
their
blood
was
abating
through
the
windows
they
watched
the
monotonous
country
as
it
rushed
by
and
disappeared
into
the
fog
rest
your
head
on
my
knees
and
lie
down
said
hippolyte
he
laid
his
head
on
her
knee
she
said
the
wind
has
disarranged
your
mustache
with
her
she
raised
several
of
the
light
hairs
which
had
fallen
on
his
mouth
he
kissed
her
she
passed
her
hand
through
his
hair
she
said
you
too
have
very
long
eyelashes
to
admire
his
lashes
she
closed
his
eyes
then
she
caressed
his
brow
and
temples
she
made
him
kiss
once
more
each
one
of
her
fingers
one
after
the
other
her
head
bent
over
george
and
from
beneath
george
saw
her
mouth
open
with
infinite
slowness
saw
unfold
the
snowy
whiteness
of
her
teeth
she
closed
her
mouth
then
again
slowly
opened
it
with
an
almost
insensible
a
flower
with
two
petals
and
a
pearly
whiteness
shone
from
within
this
delightful
sport
threw
them
into
a
state
of
languor
they
forgot
were
happy
the
monotonous
motion
of
the
train
soothed
them
in
low
tones
they
exchanged
terms
of
adoration
this
is
our
first
journey
together
she
said
smiling
it
is
the
first
time
we
are
alone
in
a
train
she
took
delight
in
repeating
that
this
was
a
new
experience
for
them
george
who
had
already
felt
the
spur
of
desire
became
more
animated
he
raised
himself
up
he
kissed
her
on
the
neck
just
on
the
twins
he
whispered
something
in
her
ear
an
inexpressible
light
lit
up
hippolyte
s
eyes
but
she
answered
with
vivacity
no
no
we
must
be
good
until
this
evening
we
must
wait
once
more
she
saw
a
vision
of
the
silent
hotel
of
the
furnished
chamber
of
the
large
bed
hidden
beneath
a
white
mosquito
curtain
at
this
season
of
the
year
she
said
in
order
to
distract
her
lover
s
attention
there
will
scarcely
be
anyone
at
albano
how
nice
it
will
be
all
alone
in
an
empty
hotel
we
shall
be
taken
for
a
young
couple
she
wrapped
herself
in
her
mantle
with
a
thrill
and
leaned
against
george
s
shoulder
it
is
cold
isn
t
it
when
we
arrive
we
ll
light
a
big
fire
and
we
ll
take
a
cup
of
tea
for
them
it
was
an
acute
pleasure
to
imagine
the
approaching
intoxication
they
spoke
in
low
tones
communicating
the
ardor
of
their
blood
exchanging
burning
promises
but
as
they
talked
of
future
voluptuousness
their
present
desire
grew
became
irresistible
they
lapsed
into
silence
they
united
their
lips
they
heard
nothing
more
but
the
tumultuous
beating
of
their
arteries
afterwards
it
seemed
to
them
both
as
if
a
veil
had
been
torn
from
before
their
eyes
that
an
internal
mist
was
being
the
enchantment
was
broken
the
fire
in
the
imaginary
chamber
went
out
the
bed
seemed
icy
and
the
silence
of
the
empty
hotel
became
heavy
hippolyte
leaned
her
head
against
the
back
of
the
seat
watching
the
vast
monotonous
country
disappearing
in
the
darkness
at
her
side
george
had
again
fallen
beneath
the
empire
of
his
perfidious
thoughts
a
horrible
vision
tortured
him
against
which
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
contend
because
he
saw
it
with
the
eyes
of
his
soul
those
eyes
that
no
force
of
will
can
shut
of
what
are
you
thinking
asked
hippolyte
uneasy
of
you
he
thought
of
her
of
her
the
ways
in
which
the
newly
married
generally
act
without
the
least
doubt
she
found
herself
alone
with
her
husband
just
as
she
is
now
with
me
and
it
is
perhaps
this
remembrance
which
causes
her
sadness
he
thought
also
of
the
rapid
adventures
between
two
stations
of
the
sudden
disquietude
caused
by
a
the
seizures
of
sensuality
during
the
suffocating
length
of
an
afternoon
during
the
what
horror
what
horror
he
started
violently
a
particular
kind
of
start
that
hippolyte
knew
too
well
to
be
a
sure
symptom
of
the
malady
which
afflicted
her
lover
she
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
asked
are
you
in
pain
he
nodded
looking
at
her
with
an
unhappy
smile
but
she
had
not
the
courage
to
push
her
questioning
further
because
she
feared
a
bitter
and
answer
she
preferred
to
remain
silent
but
she
kissed
him
on
his
long
kiss
as
usual
in
the
hope
of
unloosening
the
tangle
of
cruel
reflections
here
we
are
at
cecchina
she
cried
with
relief
as
she
heard
the
whistle
announcing
their
arrival
love
we
must
get
down
in
order
to
amuse
him
she
affected
gayety
she
lowered
the
window
and
looked
out
the
evening
is
cold
but
beautiful
make
haste
love
this
is
our
anniversary
we
must
be
happy
the
sound
of
her
strong
and
tender
voice
drove
away
his
gloominess
on
alighting
in
the
fresh
air
he
felt
himself
restored
to
serenity
a
sky
limpid
as
a
diamond
curved
like
a
vault
over
the
country
drenched
with
water
in
the
transparent
atmosphere
there
still
flitted
beams
of
crepuscular
light
the
stars
came
out
one
by
one
as
if
shaken
on
the
staffs
of
invisible
we
must
be
happy
george
heard
internally
the
echo
of
hippolyte
s
remark
and
his
soul
swelled
with
indefinite
aspirations
on
this
solemn
and
pure
night
the
quiet
chamber
the
flaming
hearth
the
bed
with
its
draperies
appeared
to
him
to
be
elements
too
humble
for
happiness
it
is
our
must
be
happy
of
what
had
he
was
he
doing
at
this
same
hour
two
years
ago
he
had
wandered
aimlessly
through
the
streets
pressed
on
by
an
instinctive
desire
to
seek
more
deserted
spots
yet
attracted
nevertheless
towards
the
populous
quarters
where
his
pride
and
joy
seemed
to
grow
by
contrast
with
the
common
life
where
the
ambient
noises
of
the
city
sounded
in
his
ears
only
like
a
distant
murmur
the
old
hotel
of
ludovico
togni
with
the
walls
of
its
long
vestibule
done
in
stucco
and
painted
to
imitate
marble
with
its
with
green
doors
decorated
all
over
with
commemorative
stones
gave
an
immediate
impression
of
peace
all
the
furniture
had
an
aspect
of
being
heirlooms
the
beds
the
chairs
the
sofas
the
couches
the
chests
of
drawers
had
the
style
of
another
age
now
fallen
into
disuse
the
delicately
colored
ceilings
bright
yellow
and
were
decorated
at
their
centres
with
garlands
of
roses
or
other
usual
symbols
such
as
a
lyre
a
torch
or
a
quiver
on
the
and
woollen
carpet
the
bouquets
of
flowers
had
faded
and
had
become
almost
invisible
the
window
curtains
white
and
modest
hung
from
poles
from
which
the
gilt
had
worn
off
the
mirrors
while
reflecting
these
antique
images
in
a
dull
mist
imparted
to
them
that
air
of
melancholy
and
almost
of
unreality
which
solitary
pools
sometimes
give
at
their
edges
how
pleased
i
am
to
be
here
cried
hippolyte
penetrated
by
the
charm
of
this
peaceful
spot
i
wish
i
could
stay
here
forever
and
she
drew
herself
up
in
the
great
armchair
her
head
leaning
against
the
back
which
was
decorated
with
a
crescent
a
modest
in
white
cotton
she
thought
once
more
of
her
dead
aunt
jane
and
of
her
distant
infancy
poor
aunt
she
said
she
had
i
recall
a
house
like
house
in
which
for
a
century
the
furniture
had
not
been
moved
from
its
place
i
always
recollect
her
unhappiness
when
i
broke
one
of
those
glass
globes
beneath
which
artificial
flowers
are
preserved
you
know
i
remember
she
cried
over
it
poor
old
aunt
i
can
see
her
cap
with
her
white
curls
which
hung
down
her
cheeks
she
spoke
slowly
pausing
from
time
to
time
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
fire
which
flamed
in
the
fireplace
and
every
now
and
then
so
as
to
smile
at
george
she
raised
her
eyes
which
were
somewhat
downcast
and
surrounded
by
dark
violet
rings
while
from
the
street
arose
the
monotonous
and
regular
noise
of
pavers
beating
the
pavement
in
the
house
i
can
recall
there
was
a
large
with
two
or
three
windows
where
we
kept
the
pigeons
you
reached
the
loft
by
means
of
a
small
straight
stairway
against
the
wall
of
which
hung
heaven
knows
since
when
skins
of
hares
hairless
and
dried
stretched
from
two
ends
of
crossed
reeds
every
day
i
carried
food
to
the
pigeons
as
soon
as
they
heard
me
coming
they
clustered
around
the
door
when
i
entered
it
was
a
veritable
assault
then
i
would
sit
on
the
floor
and
scatter
the
barley
all
around
me
the
pigeons
surrounded
me
they
were
all
white
and
i
watched
them
pecking
up
their
food
the
sound
of
a
flute
stole
in
from
a
neighboring
house
always
the
same
air
at
the
same
hour
this
music
seemed
delicious
to
me
i
listened
my
head
raised
to
the
window
my
mouth
wide
open
as
if
to
drink
in
the
notes
which
showered
from
time
to
time
a
belated
pigeon
arrived
beating
her
wings
on
my
head
and
filling
my
hair
with
white
feathers
and
the
invisible
flute
went
on
playing
the
air
still
rings
in
my
ears
i
could
hum
it
that
is
how
i
acquired
a
passion
for
music
in
a
dovecote
when
a
child
and
she
repeated
mentally
the
air
of
the
ancient
flute
of
albano
she
enjoyed
its
sweetness
with
a
melancholy
comparable
to
that
of
the
wife
who
after
many
years
discovers
a
forgotten
at
the
bottom
of
her
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
a
bell
sounded
in
the
corridor
of
the
peaceful
residence
i
remember
a
lame
hopped
into
the
room
and
it
was
one
of
my
aunt
s
greatest
favorites
one
day
a
little
girl
of
the
neighborhood
came
to
play
with
pretty
little
blond
girl
named
clarisse
my
aunt
was
confined
to
bed
by
a
cold
we
amused
ourselves
on
the
terrace
to
the
great
damage
of
the
vases
of
pinks
the
appeared
on
the
sill
looked
at
us
without
suspicion
and
squatted
down
in
a
corner
to
enjoy
the
sunshine
scarcely
had
clarisse
perceived
it
however
when
she
started
forward
to
seize
it
the
poor
little
creature
tried
to
escape
by
hopping
away
but
it
limped
so
comically
that
we
could
not
control
our
laughter
clarisse
caught
it
she
was
a
cruel
child
from
laughing
we
were
both
as
drunk
the
trembled
with
fear
in
our
hands
clarisse
plucked
one
of
its
feathers
then
i
shudder
still
when
i
think
of
it
she
plucked
the
dove
almost
entirely
before
my
eyes
with
peals
of
laughter
which
made
me
laugh
too
one
could
have
believed
that
she
was
intoxicated
the
poor
creature
despoiled
of
its
feathers
bleeding
escaped
into
the
house
as
soon
as
it
was
liberated
we
started
to
pursue
it
but
almost
at
the
same
moment
we
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
bell
and
the
calls
of
my
aunt
who
was
coughing
in
her
bed
clarisse
escaped
rapidly
by
the
stairway
i
hid
myself
behind
the
curtains
the
died
that
same
night
my
aunt
sent
me
to
rome
convinced
that
i
was
guilty
of
this
barbarity
alas
i
never
saw
aunt
jane
again
how
i
have
wept
my
remorse
will
last
forever
she
spoke
slowly
pausing
from
time
to
time
fixing
her
dilated
eyes
on
the
flaming
hearth
which
almost
magnetized
her
which
began
to
overcome
her
with
a
hypnotic
torpor
while
from
the
street
arose
the
monotonous
and
regular
noise
of
pavers
beating
the
pavement
vi
one
day
the
lovers
came
back
from
lake
nemi
somewhat
fatigued
they
had
dined
at
the
cesarini
villa
beneath
showy
camellias
in
bloom
alone
with
the
emotion
felt
only
by
him
who
contemplates
the
most
secret
of
secret
things
they
had
contemplated
the
mirror
of
diana
as
cold
as
impenetrable
to
the
view
as
the
deep
blue
of
a
glacier
as
usual
they
ordered
tea
hippolyte
who
was
looking
for
something
in
a
valise
turned
suddenly
towards
george
showing
him
a
packet
tied
with
a
ribbon
you
see
these
are
your
letters
they
never
leave
me
george
with
visible
satisfaction
cried
all
have
you
kept
all
yes
all
i
have
even
the
the
telegrams
the
only
one
missing
is
the
little
note
which
i
threw
into
the
fire
to
prevent
its
falling
into
my
husband
s
hands
but
i
saved
the
burnt
fragments
you
can
still
read
a
few
words
let
me
see
will
you
said
george
but
with
a
jealous
movement
she
hid
the
package
then
as
george
advanced
towards
her
with
a
smile
she
fled
into
the
adjoining
room
no
no
you
shall
see
nothing
i
won
t
let
you
she
refused
partly
in
jest
partly
too
because
having
always
guarded
them
preciously
as
a
hidden
treasure
with
pride
and
fear
it
was
repugnant
to
her
to
show
them
even
to
him
who
had
written
them
let
me
see
them
i
beg
of
you
i
am
so
curious
to
reread
my
letters
of
two
years
ago
what
did
i
write
you
words
of
fire
please
let
me
see
them
she
finally
consented
laughing
vanquished
by
her
friend
s
persuasive
caresses
let
us
wait
at
least
until
the
tea
is
brought
then
we
will
reread
them
together
shall
i
light
a
fire
for
you
no
he
replied
it
is
almost
hot
it
was
a
cloudless
day
with
silvery
reflections
diffused
through
the
inert
atmosphere
the
waning
day
was
softened
in
its
passage
through
the
gauze
curtains
fragrant
violets
gathered
at
the
villa
cesarini
had
already
perfumed
the
entire
chamber
someone
knocked
at
the
door
here
is
pancrazio
said
hippolyte
the
worthy
domestic
pancrazio
brought
in
his
inexhaustible
tea
and
his
inextinguishable
smile
he
placed
the
on
the
table
promised
something
good
for
dinner
and
withdrew
with
light
and
elastic
steps
all
bald
as
he
was
he
preserved
a
juvenile
air
extraordinarily
obliging
he
had
like
certain
japanese
gods
eyes
that
were
laughing
long
narrow
and
somewhat
oblique
pancrazio
is
more
amusing
than
his
tea
said
george
in
fact
the
tea
had
no
aroma
but
the
accessories
lent
it
a
strange
taste
the
and
cups
had
a
form
and
capacity
never
before
seen
the
was
decorated
with
the
history
of
an
amorous
pastoral
the
plate
garnished
with
small
slices
of
lemon
bore
on
its
centre
a
rhymed
enigma
done
in
black
letters
hippolyte
poured
out
the
tea
and
the
cups
steamed
like
censers
then
she
untied
the
package
the
letters
appeared
properly
classified
divided
into
small
bundles
what
a
quantity
cried
george
there
are
not
so
many
only
two
hundred
and
and
in
two
years
dear
one
there
are
seven
hundred
and
thirty
days
they
both
smiled
sat
down
side
by
side
near
a
table
and
began
to
read
in
the
presence
of
these
documents
of
his
love
george
felt
come
over
him
a
strange
emotion
delicate
yet
strong
the
first
letters
perplexed
him
such
or
such
an
extreme
state
of
mind
of
which
the
letters
bore
the
imprint
at
first
seemed
to
him
incomprehensible
the
lyric
flight
of
such
and
such
a
phrase
filled
him
almost
with
stupor
the
violence
and
tumult
of
his
early
passion
caused
in
him
a
sort
of
terror
by
contrast
with
the
calm
which
possessed
him
now
in
this
modest
and
quiet
house
one
of
the
letters
said
how
my
heart
sighed
for
you
that
night
a
gloomy
anguish
overwhelmed
me
even
during
the
short
intervals
of
slumber
and
i
reopened
my
eyes
in
order
to
escape
the
phantoms
which
rose
from
the
depths
of
my
soul
i
have
now
but
one
one
thought
which
tortures
you
might
go
far
away
from
me
never
no
never
has
this
possibility
pierced
my
soul
with
a
more
maddening
pain
and
terror
at
this
moment
i
have
the
the
positive
clear
evident
certitude
that
without
you
life
for
me
is
an
impossibility
when
i
think
that
i
might
lose
you
the
day
becomes
suddenly
sunlight
becomes
odious
to
me
the
earth
appears
to
me
like
a
bottomless
tomb
i
enter
a
state
of
death
another
letter
written
after
hippolyte
s
departure
read
i
make
an
enormous
effort
to
hold
my
pen
i
have
no
more
energy
no
will
i
succumb
to
such
discouragement
that
the
only
sensation
which
remains
to
me
of
my
external
existence
is
an
insupportable
loathing
of
life
the
day
is
gray
suffocating
heavy
as
lead
a
day
to
kill
in
so
to
speak
the
hours
pass
with
inexorable
slowness
and
my
misery
grows
second
by
second
always
more
horrible
and
more
savage
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
bottom
of
my
being
are
pools
of
stagnant
water
dead
and
deadly
is
this
a
physical
or
moral
suffering
i
do
not
know
i
live
on
stupid
and
inert
beneath
a
burden
which
crushes
me
without
killing
me
another
letter
read
at
last
at
four
o
clock
when
almost
hopeless
i
have
received
your
reply
i
have
read
and
reread
it
a
thousand
times
to
find
between
your
words
the
you
could
not
soul
s
secret
something
more
alive
and
sweeter
than
the
words
written
on
the
soulless
paper
i
am
possessed
with
a
terrible
desire
for
you
so
the
cried
and
groaned
on
the
table
covered
with
a
and
loaded
with
rustic
cups
in
which
an
innocent
infusion
peacefully
steamed
you
remember
said
hippolyte
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
left
rome
and
only
for
fifteen
days
george
was
absorbed
in
the
memories
of
his
mad
infatuation
he
sought
to
revive
it
within
him
and
to
understand
it
but
the
environing
comfort
was
unfavorable
for
internal
effort
the
sensation
of
this
comfort
imprisoned
his
soul
enveloping
it
loosely
the
veiled
sunlight
the
hot
drink
the
perfume
of
the
violets
the
contact
of
hippolyte
benumbed
him
am
i
then
so
far
from
the
ardor
of
former
days
he
thought
no
because
during
her
last
absence
my
anguish
was
not
less
cruel
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
filling
the
interval
between
the
of
long
ago
and
the
of
in
spite
of
all
he
could
no
longer
identify
himself
with
the
same
man
of
whom
those
written
phrases
attested
such
consternation
and
despair
he
felt
that
these
effusions
of
his
love
had
become
strangers
to
him
and
he
also
felt
all
the
emptiness
of
the
words
these
letters
resembled
the
epitaphs
which
one
reads
in
cemeteries
just
as
the
epitaphs
give
a
coarse
false
idea
of
the
dead
so
these
letters
represented
inaccurately
the
divers
conditions
of
the
soul
through
which
his
love
had
passed
he
knew
well
the
singular
fever
which
seizes
a
lover
when
writing
a
in
the
heat
of
this
fever
all
the
different
waves
of
sentiment
are
agitated
and
mixed
in
a
confused
turmoil
the
lover
does
not
know
precisely
what
he
wishes
to
express
and
he
is
embarrassed
by
the
material
insufficiency
of
the
terms
of
endearment
so
he
gives
up
trying
to
describe
his
internal
passion
such
as
it
is
and
attempts
to
express
its
intensity
by
the
exaggeration
of
the
phrases
and
by
the
employment
of
vulgar
rhetorical
effects
this
is
the
reason
why
all
amorous
correspondences
resemble
each
other
and
why
the
language
of
the
most
exalted
passion
is
almost
as
poor
as
jargon
in
these
letters
thought
george
all
is
violence
excess
convulsion
but
where
are
my
delicate
feelings
where
my
exquisite
and
complex
melancholies
where
my
profound
and
sinuous
sorrows
in
which
my
soul
went
astray
as
in
an
inextricable
labyrinth
he
now
had
the
regret
to
perceive
that
his
letters
lacked
the
rarest
qualities
of
his
which
he
had
always
cultivated
with
the
greatest
care
in
the
course
of
his
reading
he
began
to
skip
the
long
passages
of
pure
eloquence
and
sought
instead
the
indication
of
details
of
events
that
had
allusions
to
memorable
episodes
he
found
in
one
letter
towards
six
o
clock
i
entered
mechanically
the
usual
place
the
morteo
garden
where
i
had
seen
you
so
many
evenings
the
minutes
that
preceded
the
exact
hour
of
your
departure
were
a
torture
for
me
you
left
yes
you
left
without
my
having
been
able
to
bid
you
to
cover
your
face
with
kisses
to
repeat
to
you
once
more
don
t
forget
don
t
forget
towards
eleven
o
clock
a
kind
of
instinct
made
me
turn
round
your
husband
entered
with
his
friend
and
the
lady
who
usually
accompanies
them
without
any
doubt
they
had
come
back
from
seeing
you
home
i
had
then
such
a
cruel
spasm
of
pain
that
i
was
soon
forced
to
rise
and
go
out
the
presence
of
these
three
persons
who
spoke
and
laughed
as
on
other
evenings
as
if
nothing
new
had
happened
exasperated
me
their
presence
was
for
me
the
visible
and
indubitable
proof
that
you
were
gone
irremissibly
gone
he
thought
over
more
of
the
summer
evenings
when
he
had
seen
hippolyte
seated
at
a
table
between
her
husband
and
a
captain
of
infantry
opposite
to
a
little
insignificant
woman
he
did
not
know
any
of
these
three
persons
but
he
suffered
at
each
of
their
gestures
at
each
of
their
attitudes
and
at
all
that
was
vulgar
in
their
appearance
and
in
imagination
he
pictured
to
himself
the
imbecility
of
the
talk
to
which
his
refined
mistress
appeared
to
pay
sustained
attention
in
another
letter
he
found
i
am
in
doubt
i
feel
hostile
towards
you
i
am
filled
with
a
dull
anger
that
said
hippolyte
was
the
time
when
i
was
at
rimini
august
and
tempestuous
months
they
were
do
you
remember
when
you
finally
arrived
on
the
here
is
a
letter
written
on
board
ship
at
two
o
clock
we
have
anchored
at
ancona
having
sailed
from
porto
san
giorgio
your
prayers
and
wishes
have
sent
us
a
favorable
wind
marvellous
sailing
which
i
will
recount
to
you
at
the
break
of
day
we
shall
again
make
the
offing
the
is
the
king
of
coasters
your
flag
floats
from
the
till
september
we
saw
one
another
again
but
what
days
of
suffering
do
you
remember
we
were
watched
incessantly
oh
that
good
sister
do
you
recall
our
visit
to
the
temple
of
the
malatestas
do
you
remember
our
pilgrimage
to
the
church
of
san
giuliano
the
evening
before
your
departure
here
is
another
from
venice
they
read
it
together
with
equal
palpitation
since
the
ninth
i
am
at
venice
sadder
than
ever
venice
stupefies
me
the
most
radiant
of
dreams
does
not
equal
in
magnificence
this
dream
of
marble
which
emerges
from
the
waves
and
blossoms
in
an
illusionary
sky
i
am
dying
of
melancholy
and
desire
why
are
you
not
here
oh
if
you
had
come
if
you
had
only
executed
your
former
project
maybe
we
should
have
been
able
to
steal
one
hour
from
espionage
and
in
the
treasury
of
our
souvenirs
we
should
have
counted
one
more
the
most
divine
amongst
them
all
on
another
leaf
they
read
again
i
have
a
strange
thought
which
from
time
to
time
pierces
my
soul
like
a
lightning
flash
and
disturbs
my
whole
being
a
foolish
dream
i
think
that
you
could
come
here
suddenly
alone
to
be
entirely
mine
further
on
again
the
beauty
of
venice
is
the
natural
frame
of
your
beauty
the
colors
of
your
complexion
so
rich
and
pale
amber
and
dull
gold
in
which
are
mixed
possibly
several
shades
of
drooping
the
ideal
colors
which
harmonize
the
most
happily
with
the
venetian
air
i
do
not
know
how
catherine
cornaro
queen
of
cyprus
looked
but
i
do
not
know
why
i
imagine
she
resembled
you
you
see
said
hippolyte
it
was
a
continual
seduction
refined
and
irresistible
i
suffered
more
than
you
can
imagine
instead
of
sleeping
i
passed
nights
in
seeking
a
means
of
going
out
alone
without
awakening
the
suspicions
of
my
guests
i
was
a
prodigy
of
cleverness
i
no
longer
know
what
i
did
when
i
found
myself
alone
with
you
in
the
gondola
on
the
grand
canal
that
september
dawn
i
did
not
believe
that
it
was
real
do
you
recollect
i
burst
into
sobs
unable
to
say
a
word
to
you
but
was
waiting
for
you
i
was
sure
that
you
would
come
at
any
cost
and
that
was
the
first
of
our
great
imprudences
it
is
true
what
does
it
matter
murmured
the
young
woman
was
it
not
better
so
was
it
not
better
so
now
that
i
belong
to
you
entirely
for
my
part
i
regret
nothing
george
kissed
her
on
the
temple
she
spoke
for
a
long
time
of
this
episode
which
was
one
of
the
most
pleasant
and
extraordinary
among
their
souvenirs
they
lived
over
again
minute
by
minute
the
two
days
of
their
secret
stay
at
the
hotel
days
of
oblivion
supreme
intoxication
in
which
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
both
lost
all
notion
of
the
world
and
all
consciousness
of
their
previous
being
those
days
had
marked
the
commencement
of
hippolyte
s
ruin
the
letters
which
followed
alluded
to
her
first
trials
when
i
think
that
i
am
the
initial
cause
of
your
sufferings
and
of
all
your
domestic
troubles
an
inexpressible
remorse
torments
me
and
in
order
to
obtain
pardon
for
the
ill
of
which
i
am
the
cause
i
want
you
to
know
the
entire
depth
of
my
passion
do
you
know
my
passion
are
you
sure
that
my
love
will
be
able
to
repay
you
for
your
long
anguish
are
you
sure
of
convinced
of
it
the
ardor
went
on
increasing
page
by
page
then
from
april
to
july
there
was
an
obscure
interval
without
documents
it
was
during
these
four
months
that
the
catastrophe
happened
the
husband
too
weak
not
having
found
any
means
of
conquering
hippolyte
s
open
and
obstinate
rebellion
had
so
to
say
taken
flight
and
left
behind
him
very
much
involved
business
affairs
in
which
he
had
sunk
the
greater
part
of
his
fortune
hippolyte
had
sought
refuge
with
her
mother
then
with
her
sister
at
caronno
in
a
and
then
a
terrible
malady
from
which
she
had
already
suffered
in
her
nervous
malady
analogous
to
upon
her
the
letters
dated
in
august
spoke
of
it
no
you
could
never
conceive
the
fright
that
my
mind
is
in
what
tortures
me
above
all
is
the
implacable
lucidity
of
my
imaginary
vision
i
you
your
face
become
distorted
and
your
eyes
roll
hopelessly
beneath
their
lids
i
see
your
hands
shrivelled
and
shrunk
and
between
your
fingers
the
curl
of
hair
and
whatever
effort
i
make
i
can
not
succeed
in
dispelling
the
terrible
vision
and
then
i
you
call
me
i
have
actually
in
my
ears
the
sound
of
your
hoarse
and
lamentable
voice
of
a
person
who
calls
for
help
without
the
hope
of
being
helped
a
little
way
further
on
you
write
me
if
this
illness
should
seize
me
when
i
am
in
your
arms
no
no
i
will
not
see
you
again
i
do
not
wish
to
see
you
again
were
you
mad
when
you
wrote
that
did
you
think
of
what
you
wrote
it
is
as
if
you
had
taken
my
life
as
if
i
could
no
longer
breathe
quick
another
letter
tell
me
you
will
recover
that
you
still
hope
that
you
want
to
see
me
again
recover
do
you
hear
hippolyte
recover
during
the
convalescence
the
letters
were
gentle
and
playful
i
send
you
a
flower
gathered
on
the
sands
it
is
a
species
of
wild
lily
marvellous
when
growing
and
of
an
odor
so
penetrating
that
i
often
find
at
the
bottom
of
the
chalice
an
insect
in
a
swoon
of
intoxication
the
whole
coast
is
covered
with
these
passionate
lilies
which
beneath
the
torrid
sun
on
the
broiling
sand
flower
in
one
minute
and
only
live
a
few
hours
see
how
charming
this
flower
is
even
when
dead
see
how
delicate
it
is
and
fine
and
feminine
up
to
the
month
of
november
the
letters
followed
one
another
without
interruption
but
little
by
little
they
became
bitter
full
of
suspicions
doubts
reproaches
how
far
you
have
gone
from
me
i
am
tortured
by
something
else
than
the
chagrin
of
mere
material
separation
it
seems
to
me
that
your
soul
has
also
left
and
abandoned
me
your
fragrance
makes
others
happy
to
look
at
you
to
hear
you
is
not
enjoy
you
write
to
me
tell
me
that
you
belong
entirely
to
me
in
all
your
acts
in
all
your
thoughts
and
that
you
desire
me
and
that
you
regret
me
and
that
separated
from
me
you
find
no
beauty
in
any
instant
of
life
further
on
i
think
i
think
and
my
thought
goads
me
and
the
sting
of
this
thought
causes
in
me
an
abominable
suffering
at
times
i
am
seized
with
a
frenzied
desire
to
pluck
from
my
throbbing
temples
this
impalpable
thing
which
is
however
stronger
and
more
inflexible
than
a
dart
to
breathe
is
an
insupportable
fatigue
for
me
and
the
throbbing
of
my
arteries
goes
through
me
as
would
the
sound
of
hammer
blows
that
i
might
be
condemned
to
hear
is
that
love
oh
no
it
is
a
kind
of
monstrous
infirmity
which
can
blossom
only
in
me
for
my
joy
and
my
martyrdom
i
please
myself
by
believing
that
no
other
human
creature
has
ever
felt
as
i
do
further
on
never
no
never
shall
i
have
complete
peace
and
complete
security
i
could
be
content
only
on
one
i
absorbed
all
all
your
being
that
you
and
i
no
longer
were
more
than
a
single
being
that
i
lived
your
life
that
i
thought
your
thoughts
or
at
least
i
would
wish
that
your
senses
were
closed
to
all
sensations
that
did
not
originate
in
me
i
am
a
poor
ill
patient
my
days
are
but
a
long
agony
i
have
rarely
desired
them
to
end
as
much
as
i
desire
and
pray
for
it
now
the
sun
is
about
to
set
and
the
night
which
descends
on
my
soul
envelops
me
in
a
thousand
horrors
the
shadows
issue
from
every
corner
of
my
room
and
advance
towards
me
as
would
a
live
person
whose
footsteps
and
breathing
i
could
hear
whose
hostile
attitude
i
could
to
await
hippolyte
s
return
george
had
returned
to
rome
in
the
first
days
of
november
and
the
letters
dated
at
that
time
alluded
to
a
very
unhappy
and
dismal
episode
you
wrote
me
i
have
had
great
difficulty
in
remaining
true
to
you
what
do
you
mean
by
that
what
were
the
which
have
upset
you
my
god
how
you
are
changed
it
makes
me
suffer
inexpressibly
and
my
pride
is
irritated
at
my
suffering
between
my
eyebrows
is
a
furrow
deep
as
the
cleft
of
a
wound
in
which
is
heaped
my
repressed
anger
in
which
gathers
all
the
bitterness
of
my
doubts
my
suspicions
my
disgusts
i
believe
that
even
your
kisses
would
not
suffice
to
rid
me
of
it
your
letters
trembling
with
desires
disturb
me
i
am
not
grateful
to
you
for
them
for
two
or
three
days
i
have
something
in
my
heart
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
perhaps
a
presentiment
perhaps
a
divination
while
he
read
george
suffered
as
from
a
wound
reopened
hippolyte
would
have
liked
to
stop
him
from
continuing
she
remembered
that
evening
when
her
husband
had
called
unexpectedly
at
the
house
in
caronno
with
a
cold
calm
face
but
with
the
look
of
a
madman
declaring
that
he
had
come
to
take
her
back
she
recalled
the
moment
when
she
was
alone
with
him
face
to
face
in
an
room
the
window
curtains
of
which
were
blown
about
by
the
which
the
light
abruptly
flared
up
and
then
which
the
moaning
of
the
trees
was
borne
up
from
below
she
remembered
the
silent
savage
fight
sustained
then
against
that
man
who
had
suddenly
clasped
order
to
take
her
by
force
enough
enough
she
said
drawing
george
s
head
to
her
enough
don
t
let
us
read
any
more
but
he
wanted
to
continue
i
can
not
understand
the
reappearance
of
that
man
and
i
can
not
prevent
a
feeling
of
anger
which
is
directed
even
at
you
too
but
to
spare
you
pain
i
will
abstain
from
writing
you
my
thoughts
on
this
subject
they
are
bitter
and
gloomy
thoughts
i
feel
that
my
affection
is
poisoned
for
some
time
it
were
better
i
think
if
you
never
saw
me
again
if
you
wish
to
avoid
useless
pain
do
not
return
now
now
i
am
not
in
a
good
frame
of
mind
my
soul
loves
you
to
adoration
but
my
thought
rends
and
sullies
you
it
is
a
contrast
which
recommences
incessantly
and
which
will
never
end
in
the
next
day
s
letter
he
wrote
a
pain
an
atrocious
pain
intolerable
never
felt
before
o
hippolyte
come
back
come
back
i
want
to
see
you
to
speak
to
you
to
caress
you
i
love
you
more
than
ever
yet
spare
me
the
sight
of
your
bruises
i
am
incapable
of
thinking
of
them
without
fear
and
without
anger
i
feel
that
if
i
saw
the
marks
impressed
in
your
flesh
by
the
hands
of
that
man
my
heart
would
break
it
is
horrible
enough
george
don
t
let
us
read
anymore
begged
hippolyte
again
taking
the
loved
one
s
head
between
her
hands
and
kissing
his
eyes
please
george
she
succeeded
in
drawing
him
away
from
the
table
he
smiled
that
indefinable
smile
which
sometimes
invalids
have
when
they
yield
to
the
entreaties
of
others
knowing
full
well
that
the
remedy
is
late
and
useless
vii
on
good
friday
evening
they
started
on
their
return
to
rome
before
their
departure
about
five
o
clock
they
took
tea
they
were
taciturn
the
simple
existence
they
had
led
in
this
old
house
appeared
extraordinarily
beautiful
and
desirable
to
them
now
it
was
about
to
end
the
intimacy
of
the
modest
lodging
seemed
sweeter
and
more
profound
to
them
the
places
where
they
had
promenaded
their
melancholy
and
their
tenderness
were
illuminated
by
ideal
lights
it
was
then
still
another
fragment
of
their
love
and
of
their
being
that
fell
annihilated
into
the
abyss
of
time
that
too
is
past
said
george
what
can
i
do
said
hippolyte
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
could
no
longer
sleep
anywhere
than
on
your
heart
they
looked
into
each
other
s
eyes
communicating
each
other
s
emotion
feeling
the
rising
wave
choking
their
throats
they
remained
silent
they
listened
to
the
regular
and
monotonous
sound
made
by
the
pavers
beating
the
pavement
but
the
irritating
noise
augmented
their
uneasiness
that
is
insupportable
said
george
rising
the
measured
blows
revived
in
him
the
sentiment
of
the
flight
of
time
which
he
had
already
so
strongly
felt
they
inspired
in
him
that
sort
of
anxious
terror
which
he
had
already
often
experienced
when
listening
to
the
oscillations
of
a
pendulum
and
yet
on
the
preceding
days
had
not
the
same
noise
lulled
him
into
a
vague
state
of
comfort
he
thought
in
two
or
three
hours
we
shall
separate
i
shall
recommence
my
usual
life
which
is
only
a
series
of
petty
miseries
my
habitual
illness
will
inevitably
seize
upon
me
again
moreover
i
know
the
troubles
that
spring
revives
in
me
i
shall
suffer
without
cease
and
i
have
already
a
premonition
that
one
of
my
most
pitiless
tormentors
will
be
the
idea
that
exili
has
put
in
my
head
if
hippolyte
wished
to
cure
me
could
she
maybe
at
least
partly
why
should
she
not
come
with
me
to
some
lonely
place
not
for
a
week
but
for
a
very
long
time
she
is
adorable
in
intimacy
full
of
trifling
kind
attentions
and
of
childish
graces
maybe
by
her
constant
presence
she
would
succeed
in
curing
me
or
at
least
in
making
me
take
life
more
lightly
he
stopped
before
hippolyte
took
her
two
hands
in
his
and
asked
have
you
been
very
happy
during
these
few
days
answer
me
his
voice
was
agitated
and
persuasive
i
was
never
so
happy
before
she
replied
feeling
a
deep
sincerity
in
this
answer
george
pressed
her
hands
with
force
and
continued
will
it
be
possible
for
you
to
go
back
to
your
existence
i
do
not
know
she
answered
i
do
not
look
before
me
you
know
all
is
lost
she
lowered
her
eyes
george
seized
her
in
his
arms
passionately
you
love
me
do
you
not
i
am
the
only
aim
of
your
existence
you
see
only
me
in
your
future
with
an
unexpected
smile
which
raised
her
long
eyelashes
she
said
yes
you
know
it
he
added
once
more
in
a
low
voice
his
face
bowed
down
you
know
my
malady
she
seemed
to
have
guessed
her
lover
s
thought
as
if
in
confidence
in
a
whispering
voice
which
seemed
to
draw
closer
the
circle
in
which
they
breathed
and
palpitated
together
she
asked
what
can
i
do
to
cure
you
they
were
silent
clasped
in
each
other
s
arms
but
in
the
silence
their
two
souls
dwelt
and
decided
upon
the
same
thing
come
with
me
he
cried
at
length
let
us
go
to
some
unknown
country
let
us
stay
there
all
spring
all
summer
as
long
as
we
will
cure
me
without
hesitation
she
replied
i
am
ready
i
belong
to
you
they
disengaged
themselves
comforted
the
hour
of
departure
had
come
they
strapped
the
last
valise
hippolyte
gathered
all
her
flowers
already
withered
in
the
glasses
the
violets
of
the
villa
cesarini
the
cyclamens
the
anemones
and
the
periwinkles
of
the
chigi
park
the
simple
roses
of
the
a
branch
of
an
gathered
in
the
neighborhood
of
diana
s
baths
on
their
way
home
from
the
emissary
these
flowers
could
have
told
all
their
idylls
oh
the
frolicsome
course
in
the
park
in
descending
a
steep
incline
on
the
dry
leaves
in
which
their
feet
sank
to
the
ankles
she
shouted
and
laughed
pricked
on
the
legs
by
the
sharp
nettles
through
the
fine
stockings
and
then
before
her
george
beat
down
the
sharp
stems
with
blows
of
his
cane
so
that
she
could
trample
upon
them
without
danger
very
green
and
innumerable
nettles
adorned
the
diana
s
baths
the
mysterious
cave
in
which
favorable
echoes
were
transformed
into
the
music
of
slowly
dropping
water
and
from
the
depths
of
the
humid
shadow
they
saw
the
country
all
covered
with
and
peach
trees
infinitely
delightful
beneath
the
pallor
of
the
limpid
waters
so
many
flowers
so
many
souvenirs
see
she
said
showing
george
a
ticket
it
is
the
ticket
for
i
shall
keep
it
pancrazio
knocked
at
the
door
he
brought
george
the
receipted
bill
in
the
emotion
produced
by
the
signor
s
generosity
he
was
all
confused
in
his
expressions
of
thanks
and
good
wishes
finally
he
drew
two
from
his
pocket
and
offered
them
to
the
signor
and
signora
to
recall
to
them
his
humble
name
begging
to
be
excused
for
his
boldness
scarcely
had
he
retired
than
the
false
wed
began
to
laugh
the
cards
bore
in
pompous
letters
pancrazio
petrella
i
will
keep
them
too
as
a
remembrance
said
hippolyte
pancrazio
knocked
a
second
time
at
the
door
he
brought
signora
a
or
five
magnificent
oranges
his
eyes
sparkled
in
his
rubicund
visage
he
warned
them
it
is
time
to
go
down
in
descending
the
staircase
the
two
lovers
felt
a
certain
sadness
and
a
sort
of
fear
fall
upon
them
as
if
on
leaving
this
peaceful
asylum
they
were
about
to
face
some
unknown
peril
the
old
took
leave
of
them
at
the
door
saying
with
regret
i
had
such
beautiful
larks
for
this
evening
george
answered
with
a
contraction
of
his
lips
we
will
come
again
will
come
again
soon
while
they
proceeded
to
the
station
the
sun
sank
below
the
sea
at
the
extreme
horizon
of
the
roman
amidst
the
thick
mists
at
cecchina
it
began
to
drizzle
when
they
separated
rome
on
that
good
friday
evening
humid
and
foggy
appeared
to
them
like
a
city
in
which
one
could
only
die
paternal
roof
i
about
the
end
of
april
hippolyte
left
for
milan
where
her
sister
whose
was
dying
had
called
her
george
aurispa
had
arranged
to
leave
also
in
search
of
a
new
and
unfrequented
place
towards
the
middle
of
may
they
were
to
meet
again
but
just
at
that
time
george
received
an
alarming
letter
from
his
mother
she
was
unhappy
almost
in
despair
in
consequence
he
could
no
longer
defer
his
return
to
the
paternal
house
when
he
became
convinced
that
his
duty
urged
him
to
hasten
at
once
where
there
was
real
sorrow
he
was
seized
by
feelings
of
anguish
which
overcame
by
degrees
his
first
sentiment
of
filial
piety
and
he
felt
rise
within
him
a
sharp
irritation
which
increased
in
acuteness
as
the
scenes
of
the
coming
conflict
clearer
and
more
numerous
surged
through
his
conscience
and
this
irritation
soon
became
so
acute
that
it
dominated
him
entirely
persistently
nourished
by
the
material
annoyances
of
the
departure
by
the
farewells
the
separation
was
more
cruel
than
ever
george
passed
through
a
period
of
the
most
intense
sensibility
the
exasperation
of
all
his
nerves
kept
him
in
a
constant
state
of
uneasiness
he
appeared
to
no
longer
believe
in
the
promised
happiness
the
future
peace
when
hippolyte
bade
him
he
asked
shall
we
meet
again
when
he
kissed
her
lips
for
the
last
time
as
she
passed
through
the
door
he
noticed
that
she
lowered
a
black
veil
over
the
kiss
and
this
insignificant
trifle
caused
him
profound
distress
assumed
in
his
imagination
the
importance
of
a
sinister
presentiment
on
arriving
at
guardiagrele
at
his
birthplace
under
the
paternal
roof
he
was
so
exhausted
that
when
he
embraced
his
mother
he
began
to
cry
like
a
child
but
neither
the
embrace
nor
his
tears
comforted
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
a
stranger
in
his
own
he
was
visiting
a
family
which
was
not
his
own
this
singular
sensation
of
isolation
already
experienced
under
other
circumstances
connected
with
his
kin
returned
now
more
vivid
and
more
importunate
than
ever
a
thousand
little
particulars
of
the
family
life
irritated
him
hurt
him
during
lunch
during
dinner
certain
silences
during
which
only
the
sounds
of
the
forks
were
heard
made
him
feel
horribly
uncomfortable
certain
refinements
to
which
he
was
accustomed
received
every
moment
a
sudden
and
painful
shock
the
air
of
discord
hostility
and
open
warfare
which
weighed
heavily
on
this
household
almost
choked
him
the
very
evening
of
his
arrival
his
mother
had
taken
him
aside
to
recount
her
troubles
and
her
ailments
to
tell
him
about
the
bad
behavior
and
dissoluteness
of
her
husband
in
a
voice
trembling
with
anger
looking
at
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
had
said
to
him
your
father
is
an
infamous
man
her
eyelids
were
somewhat
swollen
reddened
by
the
large
tears
her
cheeks
were
hollow
her
whole
person
bore
the
signs
of
suffering
he
is
an
infamous
man
a
wretch
as
he
went
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
george
still
had
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
his
ears
he
saw
before
him
his
mother
s
attitude
he
continued
to
hear
the
ignominious
accusations
against
the
man
whose
blood
ran
in
his
veins
and
his
heart
was
so
heavy
that
he
believed
he
could
carry
it
no
longer
but
suddenly
a
furious
rapture
created
a
diversion
carried
his
thoughts
back
to
his
absent
mistress
and
he
felt
that
he
owed
his
mother
no
thanks
for
reciting
to
him
all
those
felt
he
would
have
liked
much
better
not
to
know
of
or
in
any
way
to
occupy
himself
with
anything
but
his
love
to
suffer
from
nothing
but
his
love
he
entered
his
room
and
locked
himself
in
the
may
moon
illuminated
the
windows
of
the
balconies
thirsty
for
the
night
air
he
opened
the
windows
leaned
on
the
balustrade
drank
in
with
deep
breaths
the
cool
air
of
the
night
an
infinite
peace
reigned
below
in
the
valley
and
the
majella
still
all
white
with
snow
seemed
to
deepen
the
azure
by
the
solemn
simplicity
of
its
outlines
guardiagrele
like
a
flock
of
sheep
slept
around
the
santa
maria
maggiore
a
single
window
lit
up
in
the
house
opposite
made
a
spot
of
yellowish
light
he
forgot
his
recent
wound
before
the
splendor
of
the
night
he
had
but
one
single
this
is
a
night
lost
to
happiness
he
began
to
listen
amidst
the
silence
he
heard
the
stamping
of
a
horse
in
a
neighboring
stable
then
a
feeble
tinkling
of
small
bells
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
lighted
window
and
in
the
rectangle
of
light
he
saw
shadows
flit
as
of
persons
in
active
motion
within
he
listened
intently
he
believed
he
heard
a
light
knock
at
his
door
he
went
to
open
it
although
not
sure
it
was
his
aunt
joconda
she
entered
have
you
forgotten
me
she
said
kissing
him
in
fact
not
having
seen
her
when
he
arrived
he
had
not
thought
of
her
he
excused
himself
took
her
hand
made
her
sit
down
spoke
to
her
in
an
affectionate
tone
aunt
joconda
his
father
s
eldest
sister
was
almost
sixty
she
limped
as
the
result
of
a
fall
and
she
was
rather
short
but
an
unhealthy
stoutness
flabby
pallid
given
entirely
to
religious
practices
she
lived
by
herself
in
her
room
on
the
top
floor
of
the
house
without
having
almost
any
connection
with
the
family
neglected
but
little
loved
considered
as
being
her
little
world
was
full
of
consecrated
images
relics
emblems
symbols
she
did
nothing
else
but
follow
religious
exercises
doze
in
the
monotony
of
her
prayers
endure
the
cruel
tortures
caused
by
her
gormandizing
she
had
a
greedy
passion
for
confectionery
and
all
other
nourishment
she
had
no
taste
for
but
often
she
lacked
sweets
and
george
was
her
favorite
because
each
time
he
came
to
guardiagrele
he
brought
her
a
box
of
and
a
box
of
rossolis
so
she
said
in
a
mumbling
voice
from
between
her
almost
empty
gums
so
you
have
come
eh
you
have
come
she
regarded
him
with
a
sort
of
timidity
finding
nothing
else
to
say
but
a
manifest
expectancy
showed
in
her
eyes
and
george
felt
his
heart
contract
with
anxious
pity
this
miserable
creature
thought
he
has
sunk
to
the
lowest
degradations
of
human
nature
i
am
bound
to
this
poor
bigoted
gormand
by
ties
of
blood
i
am
of
her
race
a
visible
uneasiness
had
taken
possession
of
aunt
joconda
a
look
that
was
almost
impudent
came
into
her
eyes
she
repeated
oh
forgive
me
aunt
joconda
he
said
at
last
with
a
painful
effort
i
forgot
to
bring
you
some
candy
the
old
woman
changed
countenance
as
if
she
were
on
the
point
of
fainting
her
eyes
became
dim
she
stuttered
it
doesn
t
but
i
will
get
you
some
added
george
consolingly
yet
with
a
sinking
heart
i
will
the
old
woman
became
livelier
she
said
very
rapidly
you
know
at
the
ursulines
it
s
to
be
had
a
silence
followed
during
which
aunt
joconda
had
without
doubt
a
foretaste
of
the
morrow
s
delicacies
because
her
toothless
mouth
gave
forth
the
little
sound
that
one
makes
in
the
superabundant
saliva
my
poor
george
ah
if
i
had
not
my
george
you
see
what
has
occurred
in
this
house
is
a
punishment
from
heaven
but
go
boy
go
out
on
the
balcony
and
look
at
the
vases
am
the
only
one
who
waters
them
i
always
think
of
george
formerly
i
had
demetrius
but
now
i
have
no
one
but
you
she
rose
took
her
nephew
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
one
of
the
balconies
she
showed
him
the
flowering
vases
she
plucked
a
bergamot
leaf
and
held
it
out
to
him
she
stooped
down
to
feel
if
the
earth
were
dry
wait
she
said
where
are
you
going
aunt
joconda
wait
she
went
off
with
her
limping
gait
left
the
room
returned
a
minute
later
with
a
pitcher
full
of
water
which
she
could
scarcely
carry
but
aunt
why
do
you
do
this
work
why
give
yourself
this
trouble
the
vases
require
to
be
watered
if
i
did
not
think
of
them
who
would
she
sprinkled
the
vases
her
respiration
was
heavy
and
the
hoarse
panting
of
her
senile
chest
distressed
the
young
man
that
will
do
that
will
do
he
said
taking
the
pitcher
from
her
hands
they
stayed
on
the
balcony
while
the
water
from
the
vases
dropped
into
the
street
with
a
light
splash
what
is
that
lighted
window
asked
george
to
break
the
silence
oh
replied
the
old
woman
it
is
don
defendente
scioli
who
is
dying
and
both
watched
the
moving
shadows
in
the
rectangle
of
yellow
light
the
old
woman
began
to
shiver
in
the
cold
night
air
come
go
to
bed
aunt
joconda
he
wanted
to
escort
her
to
her
room
on
the
floor
above
while
following
a
lobby
they
met
something
which
was
dragging
itself
heavily
along
the
floor
it
was
a
tortoise
the
old
woman
stopped
to
say
it
is
as
old
as
you
and
it
has
become
lame
like
myself
your
father
with
a
blow
of
his
he
remembered
the
plucked
and
aunt
jane
and
certain
hours
spent
at
albano
they
arrived
at
the
threshold
of
her
chamber
a
disgusting
odor
of
sickness
emanated
from
the
interior
by
the
feeble
light
of
a
lamp
one
could
see
the
walls
covered
with
madonnas
and
crosses
a
torn
screen
an
showing
the
stuffing
and
the
springs
will
you
come
in
no
thanks
aunt
joconda
go
to
bed
she
entered
quickly
then
came
back
to
the
door
with
a
paper
packet
which
she
opened
before
george
and
emptied
a
little
sugar
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
you
see
it
is
all
i
have
left
aunt
come
go
to
bed
good
night
and
he
left
her
his
courage
exhausted
his
stomach
upset
his
heart
saddened
he
returned
to
his
balcony
the
full
moon
was
suspended
in
the
middle
of
the
sky
the
majella
inert
and
glacial
resembled
one
of
those
selenious
promontories
which
the
telescope
has
brought
close
to
the
earth
guardiagrele
slumbered
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
bergamots
filled
the
air
with
fragrance
hippolyte
hippolyte
at
that
hour
of
supreme
anguish
all
his
soul
went
out
towards
the
loved
one
demanding
assistance
suddenly
from
the
lighted
window
a
cry
arose
in
the
silence
the
cry
of
a
woman
other
cries
followed
then
there
was
a
continued
sobbing
which
rose
and
fell
like
a
rhythmic
chant
the
agony
had
ended
a
soul
had
dissolved
itself
into
the
serene
and
funereal
night
ii
you
must
help
me
said
his
mother
you
must
speak
to
him
you
must
make
him
listen
to
you
you
are
his
yes
george
it
is
essential
she
continued
to
enumerate
her
husband
s
faults
to
lay
bare
before
the
son
the
shame
of
the
father
this
father
had
for
a
concubine
a
formerly
in
the
service
of
the
family
a
degraded
and
very
mercenary
woman
it
was
for
her
and
the
children
born
in
adultery
that
he
dissipated
all
his
fortune
without
regard
for
of
his
affairs
neglecting
his
property
selling
his
crops
at
a
sacrifice
to
the
first
comer
in
order
to
obtain
money
and
he
went
so
far
that
sometimes
through
his
fault
the
house
lacked
necessities
and
he
refused
to
give
a
dowry
to
his
younger
sister
although
she
had
been
engaged
for
a
long
time
and
if
any
observation
was
made
to
him
he
responded
by
cries
insults
sometimes
even
by
the
most
brutal
violence
you
live
far
from
us
and
do
not
know
in
what
a
hell
we
live
you
can
not
even
imagine
the
smallest
part
of
our
sufferings
but
you
are
the
eldest
you
must
speak
to
him
yes
george
you
must
his
eyes
cast
down
george
remained
silent
and
to
repress
the
exasperation
of
all
his
nerves
in
the
presence
of
this
unhappiness
which
disclosed
itself
to
him
in
so
brutal
a
manner
he
required
a
prodigious
effort
what
was
this
his
mother
that
contorted
mouth
so
full
of
bitterness
which
was
contracted
so
sharply
when
she
uttered
coarse
words
was
that
his
mother
s
mouth
had
misery
and
anger
changed
her
so
much
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
to
see
if
traces
of
the
gentleness
still
lingered
on
the
maternal
visage
how
gentle
he
had
always
known
this
mother
to
be
formerly
what
a
beautiful
and
tender
creature
she
always
was
and
how
tenderly
he
had
loved
her
in
his
childhood
in
his
adolescence
in
those
days
donna
silveria
was
tall
and
svelte
pale
and
delicate
her
hair
was
almost
blond
her
eyes
black
all
her
person
bore
the
stamp
of
a
noble
race
for
she
descended
from
that
spina
family
which
like
the
aurispas
has
its
armorial
bearings
sculptured
beneath
the
portal
of
the
santa
maria
maggiore
what
an
affectionate
being
she
used
to
be
why
therefore
this
great
change
the
son
was
distressed
by
all
his
mother
s
abrupt
gestures
at
the
bitterness
of
her
words
at
all
the
ravages
which
a
rancorous
hate
had
made
in
her
features
and
he
was
distressed
also
to
see
his
father
covered
with
so
much
ignominy
to
find
such
a
terrible
abyss
yawning
between
the
two
beings
to
whom
he
owed
his
existence
and
what
an
existence
you
understand
george
insisted
his
mother
you
must
be
energetic
when
will
you
speak
to
him
make
up
your
mind
he
heard
her
and
he
felt
at
the
bottom
of
his
entrails
the
shock
of
a
thrill
of
horror
and
he
said
to
himself
oh
mother
demand
of
me
everything
ask
of
me
the
most
atrocious
of
sacrifices
but
spare
me
this
step
do
not
compel
me
to
do
that
i
am
a
coward
at
the
thought
that
he
must
face
his
father
that
he
must
accomplish
an
act
of
vigor
and
of
his
own
will
an
unconquerable
repugnance
arose
from
the
very
roots
of
his
being
he
would
prefer
to
have
a
hand
cut
off
very
well
mother
he
replied
gloomily
i
will
speak
to
him
i
will
wait
for
a
favorable
opportunity
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
cheeks
as
if
to
tacitly
demand
forgiveness
for
the
lie
for
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
not
find
a
favorable
opportunity
i
shall
not
say
anything
they
stayed
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
the
mother
opened
the
shutters
saying
they
are
about
to
take
away
don
defendente
scioli
s
body
they
leaned
on
the
balcony
side
by
side
then
looking
up
at
the
sky
she
added
what
a
day
this
has
been
guardiagrele
the
city
of
stone
shone
resplendent
in
the
serenity
of
may
a
fresh
breeze
agitated
the
grasses
on
the
gargoyles
in
every
crevice
from
the
base
to
the
summit
santa
maria
maggiore
was
adorned
with
minute
delicate
plants
bloomed
with
innumerable
violet
flowers
and
as
the
old
cathedral
reared
its
head
in
the
azure
sky
it
seemed
clad
in
a
double
mantle
of
marble
flowers
and
of
living
flowers
i
will
not
see
hippolyte
again
thought
george
i
have
dark
forebodings
i
know
that
in
five
or
six
days
i
shall
go
to
seek
the
hermitage
of
our
dreams
but
at
the
same
time
i
know
that
it
will
be
in
vain
that
i
shall
achieve
nothing
that
i
shall
hurl
myself
against
an
unknown
obstacle
how
strange
and
indefinable
are
my
feelings
it
is
not
who
know
but
some
one
in
me
knows
that
all
is
about
to
end
he
thought
she
does
not
write
to
me
any
more
since
i
am
here
i
have
received
from
her
only
two
short
from
pallanza
the
other
from
bellagio
i
never
felt
so
far
away
from
her
perhaps
at
this
moment
another
man
pleases
her
is
it
possible
that
love
falls
out
of
a
woman
s
heart
at
why
not
her
heart
is
tired
at
albano
warmed
anew
by
buried
memories
it
palpitated
for
perhaps
the
last
time
i
was
mistaken
but
certain
incidents
for
him
who
knows
how
to
consider
them
under
their
ideal
forms
bear
in
themselves
secret
significance
precise
and
independent
of
appearances
well
when
i
examine
in
thought
all
the
little
incidents
constituting
our
life
at
albano
they
assume
an
unquestionable
significance
and
an
evident
character
they
are
final
on
the
evening
of
good
friday
when
we
arrived
at
the
station
at
rome
and
when
we
said
and
the
cab
carried
her
off
in
the
fog
did
it
not
seem
to
me
that
i
had
just
lost
her
forever
had
i
not
the
innate
conviction
that
all
was
at
an
end
his
imagination
presented
to
him
the
gesture
with
which
hippolyte
had
lowered
her
black
veil
after
the
last
kiss
and
the
sun
the
azure
the
flowers
the
general
joyousness
of
nature
suggested
to
him
only
this
reflection
without
her
life
for
me
is
impossible
at
this
moment
his
mother
leaned
over
the
balustrade
looked
towards
the
porch
of
the
cathedral
and
said
the
procession
is
leaving
the
church
the
funereal
brotherhood
left
the
porch
with
its
insignia
four
men
in
cowled
robes
carried
the
coffin
on
their
shoulders
two
long
files
of
men
also
in
cowled
robes
marched
behind
with
lighted
tapers
only
their
eyes
being
visible
through
the
two
holes
in
their
hoods
from
time
to
time
the
breeze
made
the
tiny
and
almost
invisible
flames
flicker
and
even
extinguished
some
of
them
and
the
candles
consumed
themselves
in
tears
each
cowled
man
had
at
his
side
a
barefooted
child
who
collected
the
melted
wax
in
the
hollow
of
his
two
hands
when
the
whole
cortège
had
spread
out
in
the
street
musicians
dressed
in
red
with
white
facings
struck
up
a
funeral
march
the
undertaker
s
assistants
regulated
their
steps
to
the
time
of
the
music
the
brass
instruments
glittered
in
the
sun
what
sadness
and
ridicule
in
the
honors
rendered
to
the
dead
thought
george
he
saw
himself
in
a
coffin
imprisoned
between
the
boards
carried
by
that
masquerade
of
people
escorted
by
those
candles
and
that
horrible
noise
of
trumpets
and
the
idea
filled
him
with
disgust
then
his
attention
was
attracted
to
the
ragged
urchins
who
strove
to
collect
the
waxen
tears
walking
unevenly
painfully
the
body
bent
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
flickering
flames
poor
don
defendente
murmured
the
mother
watching
the
cortège
as
it
disappeared
in
the
distance
then
immediately
as
if
she
were
addressing
herself
and
not
her
son
she
added
wearily
why
poor
he
is
at
peace
now
it
is
we
who
are
to
be
pitied
george
looked
at
her
their
eyes
met
and
she
smiled
at
him
but
a
smile
so
faint
that
not
a
line
of
her
face
was
moved
it
was
like
a
very
light
veil
scarcely
visible
which
had
spread
over
this
face
ever
stamped
with
sorrow
but
the
imperceptible
gleam
of
this
smile
had
the
same
effect
on
george
as
some
sudden
great
illumination
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
saw
distinctly
on
the
maternal
face
the
irremediable
work
of
a
great
grief
confronted
with
the
terrible
revelation
which
came
to
him
from
this
smile
an
impetuous
wave
of
tenderness
welled
up
in
his
bosom
his
mother
his
own
mother
could
no
longer
smile
but
in
that
in
that
way
henceforth
the
stigmas
of
suffering
would
be
indelible
on
the
dear
face
which
he
had
seen
bent
over
him
so
often
and
with
such
affection
in
sickness
and
in
affliction
his
mother
his
own
mother
was
killing
herself
little
by
little
was
wearing
herself
out
day
by
day
was
drifting
slowly
to
the
inevitable
tomb
and
what
caused
his
own
suffering
just
now
while
his
mother
was
breathing
out
her
distress
was
not
the
maternal
sorrow
so
much
as
the
wound
inflicted
on
his
egotism
the
shock
given
his
unstrung
nerves
by
the
unvarnished
expression
of
this
sorrow
oh
mother
he
stammered
suffocated
by
tears
and
he
took
her
hands
and
drew
her
into
the
room
what
s
the
matter
george
what
s
the
matter
my
child
asked
the
mother
frightened
at
seeing
his
face
all
bathed
in
tears
what
s
the
matter
tell
me
ah
now
he
had
found
the
dear
voice
again
that
unique
unforgettable
voice
which
touched
his
soul
to
its
very
bottom
that
voice
of
consolation
of
forgiveness
of
good
advice
of
infinite
goodness
which
he
had
heard
in
his
darkest
had
found
it
again
he
had
found
it
in
short
he
recognized
the
tender
creature
of
long
ago
the
adored
one
oh
mother
mother
and
he
pressed
her
in
his
arms
sobbing
wetting
her
with
burning
tears
kissing
her
cheeks
her
eyes
her
forehead
in
a
wild
transport
my
poor
mother
he
made
her
sit
down
knelt
before
her
and
looked
at
her
he
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
as
if
it
were
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
after
a
long
separation
she
her
mouth
contracted
with
a
sob
but
badly
concealed
which
choked
her
asked
have
i
pained
you
very
much
she
dried
her
son
s
tears
and
caressed
his
hair
then
in
a
voice
interspersed
with
convulsive
starts
she
said
no
george
no
it
is
not
for
you
to
suffer
god
has
kept
you
far
away
from
this
house
it
is
not
for
you
to
suffer
all
my
life
since
your
birth
all
my
life
always
always
i
have
sought
to
spare
you
a
single
pain
a
moment
s
unhappiness
oh
why
did
i
not
have
the
strength
to
remain
silent
this
time
i
should
have
said
nothing
i
should
not
have
told
you
forgive
me
george
i
did
not
think
i
should
cause
you
so
much
unhappiness
don
t
cry
any
more
i
entreat
you
george
i
entreat
you
don
t
cry
any
more
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
cry
she
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
down
overcome
by
anguish
see
he
said
i
am
not
crying
now
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
mother
s
knees
and
beneath
the
caress
of
the
maternal
fingers
soon
became
calm
from
time
to
time
a
sob
shook
his
body
through
his
mind
in
the
form
of
vague
sensations
passed
once
more
the
distant
afflictions
of
his
adolescence
he
heard
the
twittering
of
the
swallows
the
grating
of
the
scissors
grinder
s
wheel
the
shrill
cries
on
the
sounds
heard
in
the
afternoons
of
long
ago
which
used
to
make
his
heart
grow
faint
after
the
crisis
his
soul
found
itself
in
a
state
of
indefinable
fluctuation
but
the
image
of
hippolyte
reappeared
and
he
felt
within
him
a
new
upheaval
so
tumultuous
that
the
young
man
gave
vent
to
a
sigh
on
his
mother
s
knees
how
you
sigh
she
murmured
bending
over
him
without
raising
his
eyelids
he
smiled
but
an
immense
prostration
came
over
desolate
lassitude
a
desperate
desire
to
withdraw
from
this
truceless
struggle
the
desire
to
live
left
him
little
by
little
as
the
heat
gradually
leaves
a
corpse
of
the
recent
emotion
nothing
remained
his
mother
had
once
more
become
a
stranger
to
him
what
could
he
do
for
her
save
her
restore
peace
to
her
restore
to
her
health
and
happiness
but
was
not
the
disaster
irreparable
henceforth
was
not
this
woman
s
existence
forever
poisoned
his
mother
could
no
longer
be
a
refuge
for
him
as
in
the
days
of
his
childhood
in
the
bygone
years
she
could
neither
understand
console
nor
cure
him
their
souls
their
lives
were
too
different
she
could
only
offer
him
the
spectacle
of
his
own
torture
he
arose
embraced
her
disengaged
himself
went
out
ascended
to
his
room
and
leaned
on
the
balcony
he
saw
the
majella
all
pink
in
the
twilight
enormous
and
delicate
against
a
greenish
sky
the
deafening
cries
of
the
swallows
which
were
whirling
around
drove
him
in
he
went
to
lie
down
on
his
bed
as
he
lay
on
his
back
he
thought
to
himself
good
i
live
i
breathe
but
what
is
the
substance
of
my
life
to
what
forces
is
it
subjected
what
laws
govern
it
i
do
not
belong
to
escape
from
myself
the
sensation
i
have
of
my
being
resembles
that
of
a
man
who
condemned
to
hold
himself
upright
on
a
surface
constantly
in
oscillation
and
never
in
equilibrium
feels
support
constantly
lacking
no
matter
where
he
places
his
foot
i
am
in
a
perpetual
anguish
and
even
this
anguish
is
not
well
defined
is
it
the
anguish
of
the
fugitive
who
feels
someone
at
his
heels
is
it
the
anguish
of
the
follower
who
can
never
reach
his
aim
perhaps
it
is
both
the
swallows
twittered
as
they
passed
and
repassed
in
flocks
like
black
arrows
before
the
pale
rectangle
formed
by
the
balcony
what
do
i
lack
what
is
the
lacuna
of
my
moral
being
what
is
the
cause
of
my
impotency
i
have
the
most
ardent
desire
to
live
to
give
all
my
faculties
a
rhythmic
development
to
feel
myself
complete
and
harmonious
and
on
the
contrary
i
secretly
destroy
myself
every
day
each
day
my
life
goes
out
by
invisible
and
innumerable
fissures
i
am
like
a
bladder
which
becomes
misshapen
in
a
thousand
different
ways
at
every
agitation
of
the
liquid
it
contains
all
my
strength
does
not
serve
me
more
than
to
enable
me
to
drag
with
immense
fatigue
a
little
grain
of
dust
to
which
my
imagination
gives
the
weight
of
a
gigantic
rock
a
perpetual
conflict
confuses
all
my
thoughts
and
renders
them
sterile
what
is
it
i
lack
who
is
it
holds
in
his
power
that
portion
of
my
being
which
eludes
my
consciousness
and
yet
which
i
feel
sure
is
indispensable
for
the
continuance
of
my
life
or
rather
is
not
this
portion
of
my
existence
already
dead
so
that
only
death
will
enable
me
to
regain
it
yes
that
is
it
in
fact
death
attracts
me
the

maria
maggiore
tolled
for
vespers
again
he
saw
the
funeral
convoy
the
coffin
the
cowled
men
and
the
ragged
children
who
strove
to
collect
the
waxen
tears
walking
unevenly
painfully
the
body
bent
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
flickering
flames
these
children
greatly
preoccupied
him
later
when
he
wrote
to
his
mistress
he
developed
the
secret
allegory
which
his
mind
interested
in
such
studies
had
confusedly
perceived
one
of
them
sickly
yellowish
leaning
with
one
arm
on
a
crutch
and
collecting
the
wax
in
the
hollow
of
his
disengaged
hand
dragged
himself
along
by
the
side
of
a
species
of
giant
with
a
hood
whose
enormous
fist
brutally
grasped
the
taper
i
still
see
them
both
and
i
shall
not
forget
them
perhaps
there
is
something
in
myself
which
makes
me
resemble
that
child
my
real
life
is
in
the
power
of
some
one
a
mysterious
and
unknowable
being
who
holds
it
in
a
grasp
of
iron
and
i
see
it
being
consumed
and
i
drag
myself
after
it
and
i
tire
myself
trying
to
collect
at
least
a
few
drops
and
every
drop
that
falls
burns
my
poor
hand
iii
on
the
table
in
a
vase
there
was
a
bunch
of
fresh
roses
may
roses
which
camille
his
younger
sister
had
gathered
in
the
garden
around
the
table
were
seated
the
father
the
mother
the
brother
diego
s
fiancé
invited
to
the
elder
sister
christine
with
her
husband
and
child
a
blond
boy
with
a
complexion
fragile
as
a
blooming
lily
george
was
seated
between
his
father
and
mother
christine
s
husband
don
bartolomeo
celaia
baron
of
palleaura
was
speaking
of
municipal
intrigues
in
an
irritating
tone
he
was
a
man
approaching
fifty
dried
up
bald
at
the
top
of
his
head
as
if
tonsured
his
face
clean
shaven
the
almost
insolent
acrimony
of
his
gestures
and
manners
contrasted
strangely
with
his
ecclesiastic
aspect
as
george
listened
to
him
and
observed
him
he
thought
can
christine
be
happy
with
that
man
can
she
love
him
dear
christine
the
affectionate
melancholy
creature
whom
i
have
so
often
seen
weep
from
sudden
effusions
of
tenderness
to
be
tied
for
life
to
that
heartless
creature
almost
an
old
man
soured
by
the
silly
wrangles
of
provincial
politics
and
she
has
not
even
the
consolation
of
finding
comfort
in
maternity
she
must
be
racked
with
worry
and
anguish
for
her
anæmic
always
pensive
poor
creature
he
gave
his
sister
a
look
full
of
sympathetic
kindness
christine
smiled
at
him
over
the
roses
inclining
her
head
slightly
to
the
left
with
a
graceful
movement
peculiar
to
her
seeing
diego
by
her
side
he
thought
who
would
believe
they
were
of
the
same
race
christine
has
largely
inherited
the
amiability
of
her
mother
she
has
her
mother
s
eyes
and
above
all
has
her
ways
and
gestures
but
diego
he
observed
his
brother
with
that
instinctive
repulsion
that
every
being
feels
in
the
presence
of
an
uncongenial
contradictory
absolutely
opposite
being
diego
ate
voraciously
without
once
raising
his
head
from
above
his
plate
wholly
absorbed
in
his
work
he
was
not
yet
twenty
but
he
was
already
heavy
on
account
of
a
commencing
embonpoint
and
his
face
was
congested
his
eyes
small
and
grayish
beneath
a
low
forehead
did
not
reveal
the
slightest
intellectual
light
a
yellow
down
covered
his
cheeks
and
strong
jaws
and
cast
a
shadow
on
his
projecting
sensual
mouth
the
same
down
was
noticeable
also
on
his
hands
the
badly
kept
nails
of
which
attested
a
disdain
for
personal
cleanliness
can
i
love
him
thought
george
even
to
address
a
single
insignificant
word
to
to
respond
to
his
simple
greeting
i
have
to
surmount
an
almost
physical
repugnance
when
he
speaks
to
me
his
eyes
never
meet
mine
and
if
by
chance
our
eyes
do
meet
he
averts
his
immediately
with
a
strange
precipitation
he
reddens
before
me
almost
continually
and
without
apparent
cause
how
curious
i
am
to
know
his
sentiments
regarding
me
without
a
doubt
he
hates
me
by
a
spontaneous
transition
his
attention
was
transferred
to
his
father
to
the
man
whose
traits
diego
most
truly
inherited
stout
sanguine
powerful
the
man
seemed
to
exhale
from
his
whole
body
an
inexhaustible
warmth
of
carnal
vitality
his
jaws
were
heavy
his
mouth
imperious
full
of
a
vehement
respiration
his
eyes
restless
and
his
nose
was
swollen
freckled
and
twitched
spasmodically
every
feature
of
his
face
bore
the
impress
of
a
violent
and
cruel
nature
every
gesture
every
attitude
had
the
abruptness
of
an
effort
as
if
the
whole
muscular
system
of
his
massive
body
was
in
continual
struggle
with
the
encumbering
fat
his
flesh
that
coarse
stuff
full
of
veins
nerves
tendons
glands
and
bones
full
of
instincts
and
necessities
the
flesh
that
sweats
and
stinks
flesh
which
deforms
and
sickens
ulcerates
and
is
covered
with
wrinkles
pimples
warts
and
hairs
that
bestial
stuff
flesh
flourished
in
him
with
a
species
of
impudence
and
inspired
in
the
refined
visitor
an
unconquerable
repulsion
no
no
said
george
to
himself
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
he
was
not
like
that
i
remember
distinctly
that
he
was
not
like
that
this
growth
of
latent
and
unsuspected
brutality
appears
to
have
occurred
slowly
progressively
and
am
that
man
s
son
he
observed
his
father
he
noticed
that
at
the
angle
of
his
eyes
on
his
temples
the
man
had
a
number
of
wrinkles
and
beneath
each
eye
a
swelling
or
species
of
pouch
he
noted
the
short
neck
swollen
congested
apoplectic
he
perceived
that
the
mustache
and
hair
bore
traces
of
dye
the
beginning
of
old
age
in
the
voluptuary
the
implacable
work
of
vice
and
time
the
vain
and
clumsy
artifice
to
hide
the
senile
grayness
the
menace
of
a
sudden
these
sad
miserable
and
tragic
things
of
human
life
filled
the
son
s
heart
with
profound
distress
an
immense
pity
entered
into
his
heart
even
for
his
father
blame
him
but
he
suffers
too
all
this
flesh
which
inspires
such
a
strong
aversion
in
me
all
this
heavy
mass
of
flesh
is
inhabited
by
a
soul
what
anguish
he
may
have
felt
and
what
weariness
he
certainly
has
a
terrible
fear
of
death
suddenly
he
had
a
mental
vision
of
his
father
in
his
death
agony
an
attack
had
overthrown
him
stricken
him
mortally
he
panted
still
alive
livid
mute
unrecognizable
his
eyes
full
of
the
horror
of
death
then
as
if
stricken
to
earth
by
a
second
blow
of
the
invisible
he
lay
motionless
a
mass
of
inert
flesh
would
my
mother
weep
you
are
not
eating
anything
his
mother
said
to
him
you
do
not
drink
you
have
eaten
almost
nothing
perhaps
you
are
not
well
no
mother
he
replied
i
have
no
appetite
this
morning
the
sound
of
something
dragging
itself
along
near
the
table
caused
him
to
turn
he
perceived
the
decrepit
tortoise
and
remembered
the
words
of
aunt
joconda
she
became
lame
like
me
your
father
with
a
blow
of
his
while
he
was
looking
at
the
tortoise
his
mother
said
to
him
with
the
glimmer
of
a
smile
she
is
as
old
as
you
are
i
was
carrying
you
when
it
was
given
to
me
with
the
same
imperceptible
smile
she
added
she
was
quite
small
the
shell
was
almost
transparent
she
resembled
a
toy
she
has
lived
in
our
house
ever
since
growing
bigger
every
year
she
took
an
apple
paring
and
offered
it
to
the
tortoise
she
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
poor
animal
which
moved
its
yellowish
old
head
with
a
kind
of
dazed
trembling
then
dreamily
she
began
to
peel
an
orange
for
george
she
remembers
thought
george
seeing
his
mother
so
absorbed
he
guessed
the
inexpressible
sadness
which
without
any
doubt
entered
her
soul
at
the
recollection
of
the
happy
days
now
that
the
ruin
was
complete
now
that
after
so
many
treasons
after
so
many
infamies
all
was
irreparably
lost
she
was
loved
formerly
she
was
young
perhaps
she
had
not
yet
suffered
how
her
heart
must
sigh
what
regret
what
hopelessness
must
well
up
from
her
entrails
the
son
suffered
from
the
maternal
in
himself
his
mother
s
anguish
and
he
dwelt
so
long
savoring
the
supreme
delicacy
of
his
emotion
that
his
eyes
became
veiled
in
tears
he
repressed
the
tears
by
an
effort
and
felt
them
fall
very
softly
within
himself
oh
mother
if
you
only
knew
on
turning
round
he
saw
that
christine
was
smiling
at
him
over
the
roses
camille
s
fiancé
was
just
saying
that
is
what
one
might
call
being
ignorant
of
the
first
word
of
the
code
when
one
claims
the
baron
approved
the
young
doctor
s
arguments
and
repeated
after
each
sentence
assuredly
assuredly
they
were
demolishing
the
mayor
young
albert
was
seated
beside
camille
his
fiancée
he
was
dressed
foppishly
and
his
complexion
was
pink
and
white
like
a
wax
figure
he
wore
a
little
pointed
beard
his
hair
was
parted
in
a
straight
line
a
few
curls
were
coquettishly
arranged
around
his
forehead
and
a
pair
of
glasses
were
on
his
nose
that
is
camille
s
ideal
thought
george
for
several
years
they
have
loved
one
another
with
an
love
they
believe
in
their
future
happiness
they
have
long
sighed
for
that
happiness
without
doubt
albert
has
promenaded
with
this
poor
girl
on
his
arm
through
all
the
commonplaces
of
the
idyll
camille
is
not
robust
she
suffers
imaginary
ailments
she
does
nothing
from
morning
to
night
but
weary
her
confidant
the
piano
with
nocturnes
they
will
get
married
what
will
be
their
lot
a
young
man
vain
and
empty
a
sentimental
young
girl
in
the
petty
provincial
an
instant
longer
he
followed
in
imagination
the
development
of
these
two
mediocre
existences
and
he
felt
moved
by
pity
for
his
sister
he
looked
at
her
physically
she
resembled
him
somewhat
she
was
tall
and
slim
with
beautiful
hair
her
eyes
were
bright
but
changing
green
blue
or
ashen
in
turn
a
light
application
of
de
rendered
her
still
paler
she
wore
two
roses
on
her
bosom
perhaps
she
too
resembles
me
otherwise
than
in
he
features
perhaps
unknown
to
her
her
soul
bears
some
of
the
fatal
germs
which
have
developed
in
my
consciousness
with
such
might
her
heart
must
be
full
of
mediocre
anxieties
and
melancholies
she
is
ill
without
knowing
what
her
trouble
is
at
this
moment
his
mother
rose
they
all
followed
her
excepting
the
father
and
don
bartolomeo
celaia
who
remained
at
the
table
to
chat
which
rendered
them
both
more
odious
to
george
he
had
put
one
arm
around
his
mother
s
waist
and
the
other
around
christine
s
waist
affectionately
and
so
they
passed
into
the
adjoining
room
he
almost
dragging
them
he
felt
his
heart
swollen
by
extraordinary
tenderness
and
compassion
at
the
notes
of
the
which
camille
commenced
to
play
he
said
to
christine
will
you
come
down
into
the
garden
the
mother
remained
near
the
engaged
couple
christine
and
george
went
down
accompanied
by
the
silent
child
at
first
they
walked
side
by
side
without
speaking
george
had
taken
his
sister
s
arm
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
with
hippolyte
christine
stopped
murmuring
poor
neglected
garden
do
you
remember
our
games
when
we
were
little
and
she
looked
at
her
son
luke
go
my
luchino
run
and
play
a
little
but
the
child
did
not
move
from
his
mother
s
side
on
the
contrary
he
seized
her
hand
she
sighed
looking
at
george
you
see
it
is
always
the
same
he
never
runs
he
never
plays
he
never
laughs
he
never
leaves
me
never
wishes
to
be
away
from
me
he
s
afraid
of
everything
absorbed
in
thoughts
of
his
absent
mistress
george
did
not
hear
what
christine
was
saying
the
garden
half
in
the
sun
half
in
the
shade
was
girt
by
a
wall
on
the
top
of
which
glittered
fragments
of
broken
glass
fixed
in
the
cement
along
one
side
ran
a
vine
along
the
other
side
at
equal
distances
reared
tall
cypresses
slim
and
straight
as
candles
with
a
meagre
tuft
of
sombre
foliage
almost
black
shaped
like
a
at
the
summit
of
their
trunks
in
the
part
exposed
to
the
south
on
a
sunny
strip
of
ground
flourished
several
rows
of
orange
and
lemon
trees
just
then
in
bloom
the
rest
of
the
ground
was
strewn
with
lilacs
and
aromatic
herbs
here
and
there
could
be
seen
several
small
planted
at
regular
intervals
and
which
had
served
to
line
the
now
ruined
borders
in
one
corner
there
was
a
handsome
in
the
centre
there
was
a
round
basin
filled
with
water
in
which
were
growing
lentils
tell
me
said
christine
do
you
remember
the
day
you
fell
into
the
basin
and
how
poor
uncle
demetrius
dragged
you
out
how
you
frightened
us
that
day
it
was
a
miracle
that
you
were
taken
out
alive
at
the
name
of
demetrius
george
started
it
was
a
name
the
name
which
always
made
his
heart
palpitate
when
he
heard
it
mentioned
he
listened
to
his
sister
he
watched
the
water
over
which
insects
made
rapid
flights
an
anxious
desire
came
to
him
to
speak
of
the
dead
to
speak
of
him
freely
to
revive
all
his
memories
but
he
checked
himself
feeling
that
selfish
pride
which
prompts
one
to
conceal
a
secret
in
order
that
the
soul
may
feed
upon
it
in
solitude
he
experienced
a
sensation
almost
akin
to
jealousy
at
the
thought
that
his
sister
should
have
been
touched
and
moved
at
the
memory
of
the
dead
man
that
memory
was
his
own
property
exclusively
he
guarded
it
in
the
intimacy
of
his
soul
with
a
grieved
and
profound
cult
forever
demetrius
had
been
his
veritable
father
he
was
his
only
and
unique
parent
and
he
reappeared
to
his
mind
a
mild
meditative
man
with
a
face
full
of
a
virile
melancholy
and
a
single
white
curl
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
among
the
black
hair
giving
him
an
odd
appearance
do
you
remember
said
christine
the
evening
that
you
hid
yourself
and
passed
the
whole
night
out
of
doors
without
showing
yourself
until
morning
how
frightened
we
were
that
time
too
how
we
looked
for
you
how
we
cried
george
smiled
he
remembered
having
hid
himself
not
out
of
fun
but
from
a
cruel
curiosity
to
make
his
people
believe
he
was
lost
and
to
make
them
weep
for
him
during
the
humid
calm
had
heard
the
voices
calling
him
he
had
listened
eagerly
for
the
slightest
sounds
which
came
from
the
house
in
an
uproar
he
had
held
his
breath
with
a
joy
mixed
with
terror
on
seeing
the
persons
who
were
seeking
him
pass
near
his
after
the
entire
garden
had
been
ransacked
without
result
he
still
lay
crouching
in
his
and
then
at
the
sight
of
the
household
in
confusion
which
could
be
seen
by
the
quick
going
and
coming
of
shadows
before
the
lighted
windows
he
was
seized
by
an
extraordinary
emotion
acute
to
the
point
of
tears
he
felt
sorry
for
his
parents
and
for
himself
just
as
though
he
were
really
lost
but
in
spite
of
all
he
obstinately
persisted
in
concealing
himself
and
then
the
morning
came
and
the
slow
diffusion
of
the
light
in
the
silent
immensity
had
swept
from
his
brain
as
if
a
mist
of
folly
had
given
him
the
consciousness
of
the
reality
had
awakened
in
him
remorse
he
had
thought
of
his
father
and
the
punishment
with
terror
and
despair
and
the
basin
had
fascinated
him
he
felt
himself
attracted
by
that
pale
and
gentle
piece
of
water
which
reflected
the
water
in
which
a
few
months
before
he
had
almost
perished
it
was
during
demetrius
s
absence
he
remembered
again
do
you
smell
that
perfume
george
said
christine
i
will
gather
a
bouquet
the
air
impregnated
with
a
warm
humidity
and
charged
with
heavy
perfumes
disposed
one
to
indolence
the
bunches
of
lilac
the
the
roses
thyme
marjoram
sweet
basil
their
essences
combined
to
form
one
single
essence
delicate
yet
powerful
all
at
once
christine
asked
why
are
you
so
thoughtful
the
perfume
had
just
aroused
in
george
a
great
tumult
a
furious
resurrection
of
all
his
passion
a
desire
for
hippolyte
which
had
routed
every
other
sentiment
a
thousand
recollections
of
sensual
delights
which
coursed
through
his
veins
smiling
and
hesitating
christine
added
you
are
ah
it
is
true
you
know
said
george
reddening
suddenly
under
his
sister
s
indulgent
gaze
he
remembered
he
had
spoken
to
her
of
hippolyte
the
previous
autumn
in
september
at
the
time
he
stayed
at
her
house
at
torricelle
di
sarsa
on
the
seacoast
still
smiling
still
hesitating
christine
again
asked
do
love
her
as
much
as
you
did
still
without
further
speech
they
directed
their
steps
towards
the
orange
and
lemon
trees
both
disturbed
but
in
a
different
manner
george
felt
his
regrets
augmented
by
having
confided
in
his
sister
christine
felt
a
confused
revival
of
her
smothered
aspirations
as
she
thought
of
the
unknown
woman
whom
her
brother
adored
their
eyes
met
and
they
smiled
and
the
smile
seemed
to
diminish
their
pain
she
made
a
few
rapid
steps
towards
the
exclaiming
goodness
what
a
quantity
of
flowers
she
began
to
pluck
the
flowers
her
arms
raised
shaking
the
boughs
to
break
off
the
small
branches
the
corollas
fell
on
her
head
shoulders
and
bosom
all
around
the
ground
was
strewn
with
the
fallen
petals
as
if
with
a
fragrant
snow
she
was
charming
in
this
attitude
with
her
oval
face
and
long
white
neck
the
effort
animated
her
visage
all
at
once
her
arms
dropped
she
grew
pale
and
tottered
as
if
overcome
by
vertigo
what
s
the
matter
christine
are
you
ill
cried
george
frightened
as
he
supported
her
with
his
arm
but
a
violent
nausea
choked
her
and
she
was
unable
to
answer
she
motioned
that
she
wished
to
be
taken
away
from
the
trees
and
supported
by
her
brother
she
made
a
few
uncertain
steps
forward
while
luke
watched
her
with
terrified
eyes
then
she
stopped
gave
a
sigh
regained
her
color
little
by
little
and
in
a
voice
that
was
still
weak
said
do
not
be
alarmed
george
it
is
nothing
i
am
enceinte
the
strong
odor
made
me
feel
ill
it
is
gone
now
i
am
all
right
now
shall
we
go
back
to
the
house
no
let
us
stay
in
the
garden
let
us
sit
down
they
sat
under
the
vine
on
an
old
stone
bench
noticing
the
child
s
grave
and
absorbed
look
george
called
him
to
rouse
him
from
his
stupor
luchino
the
child
leaned
his
heavy
head
on
his
mother
s
knees
he
was
frail
as
a
he
seemed
to
have
difficulty
in
carrying
his
head
upright
on
his
shoulders
his
skin
was
so
delicate
that
every
vein
was
visible
delineated
as
if
threads
of
blue
silk
his
hair
was
so
blond
that
it
was
almost
white
his
eyes
gentle
and
humid
like
those
of
a
lamb
showed
their
pale
azure
from
between
long
fair
eyelashes
his
mother
caressed
him
pressing
her
lips
together
to
restrain
a
sob
but
two
tears
welled
up
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
oh
christine
her
brother
s
affectionate
tone
only
increased
her
emotion
other
tears
welled
up
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
you
see
george
i
have
never
claimed
anything
i
have
always
accepted
everything
i
have
always
been
resigned
to
everything
i
have
never
rebelled
you
know
that
george
but
now
this
oh
not
even
to
be
able
to
find
a
little
consolation
in
my
son
she
spoke
tearfully
and
in
a
desolate
tone
oh
george
you
see
you
see
how
it
is
he
does
not
speak
or
laugh
or
play
he
is
never
merry
and
he
never
does
what
other
children
do
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
loves
me
so
much
that
he
adores
me
he
never
leaves
my
side
never
i
begin
to
believe
that
he
only
lives
from
my
breath
oh
george
if
i
were
to
tell
you
of
certain
days
long
long
days
which
seem
endless
i
work
near
the
window
i
raise
my
eyes
and
i
meet
his
eyes
gazing
gazing
at
me
it
is
a
slow
torture
a
punishment
that
i
can
not
describe
it
is
as
if
i
felt
my
blood
flowing
drop
by
drop
from
my
heart
she
stopped
choked
by
anguish
drying
her
tears
she
went
on
if
at
least
the
one
i
am
bearing
is
born
i
will
not
say
beautiful
but
with
health
if
for
this
once
god
will
come
to
my
aid
she
became
silent
attentive
as
if
to
draw
an
omen
from
the
trembling
of
the
new
life
which
she
carried
in
her
womb
george
took
her
hand
and
for
several
minutes
the
brother
and
sister
sat
mute
and
motionless
on
the
bench
overwhelmed
by
existence
before
them
stretched
out
the
solitary
and
abandoned
garden
the
straight
and
motionless
reared
their
tall
trunks
religiously
towards
the
sky
like
votive
candles
the
rare
zephyrs
which
passed
over
the
neighboring
had
scarcely
enough
strength
to
cause
the
fall
of
the
leaves
of
the
few
faded
roses
from
time
to
time
after
intervals
of
silence
came
sounds
of
a
piano
from
the
distant
house
iv
when
when
the
action
they
wish
to
force
on
me
becomes
inevitable
then
i
shall
be
obliged
then
to
face
that
brute
george
saw
the
hour
approach
with
ungovernable
dread
an
insurmountable
repugnance
arose
from
the
roots
of
his
being
at
the
very
thought
that
he
was
going
to
find
himself
alone
in
a
closed
room
in
a
with
that
man
as
the
days
passed
he
felt
increase
his
anxiety
and
humiliation
caused
by
culpable
inertia
he
felt
that
his
mother
that
his
sister
that
all
the
victims
expected
from
him
the
some
energetic
action
some
kind
of
why
in
fact
had
he
been
summoned
why
had
he
come
from
now
on
it
no
longer
seemed
possible
for
him
to
leave
without
having
done
his
duty
without
doubt
at
the
last
minute
he
could
have
escaped
without
saying
and
then
written
a
letter
justifying
his
conduct
by
any
plausible
pretext
when
his
distress
was
at
its
height
he
ventured
to
think
of
this
ignominious
resource
he
stopped
to
consider
a
way
to
arrange
the
most
trifling
details
to
picture
the
results
but
in
the
scenes
conjured
up
the
unhappy
and
ravaged
face
of
his
mother
awoke
in
him
an
intolerable
remorse
the
reflections
which
he
made
on
his
egotism
and
his
weakness
revolted
him
against
himself
and
he
sought
with
puerile
fury
to
find
some
particle
of
energy
which
he
could
excite
and
efficaciously
employ
against
the
greater
part
of
his
being
and
which
would
permit
him
to
triumph
over
it
as
over
a
cowardly
brute
but
this
false
energy
did
not
last
did
not
serve
in
the
least
to
press
him
to
a
manly
resolution
then
he
undertook
to
calmly
examine
his
situation
and
he
deluded
himself
by
the
very
vigor
of
his
reasoning
he
thought
what
good
could
i
do
what
evils
could
my
intervention
remedy
will
this
unhappy
effort
which
my
mother
and
the
rest
demand
from
me
yield
any
real
advantage
and
what
advantage
as
he
had
not
found
in
himself
the
energy
necessary
for
the
execution
of
the
act
as
he
had
not
succeeded
in
provoking
in
himself
a
satisfactory
revolt
he
had
recourse
to
the
opposite
attempted
to
demonstrate
to
his
own
satisfaction
the
uselessness
of
the
effort
what
would
be
the
result
of
the
interview
it
would
certainly
have
none
according
to
my
father
s
humor
or
according
to
the
trend
of
his
conversation
he
would
be
either
violent
or
persuasive
in
the
first
case
his
violence
and
insults
would
take
me
by
surprise
in
the
second
case
my
father
would
find
a
mass
of
arguments
to
prove
to
me
either
his
innocence
or
the
necessity
of
his
faults
and
i
should
be
taken
equally
by
surprise
the
facts
are
irreparable
when
vice
is
rooted
in
the
intimate
substance
of
a
man
it
becomes
indestructible
now
my
father
is
at
the
age
when
vice
can
no
longer
be
rooted
out
when
habits
can
no
longer
be
changed
for
years
he
has
been
associated
with
that
woman
and
those
children
have
i
the
slightest
chance
to
convince
him
that
he
ought
to
break
off
all
those
ties
yesterday
i
saw
the
woman
it
sufficed
to
see
her
to
guess
that
she
will
never
let
go
her
hold
on
the
man
whose
flesh
she
holds
in
her
clutches
she
will
dominate
him
until
his
death
the
thing
is
now
irremediable
and
then
there
are
those
children
and
those
children
s
rights
besides
after
all
that
has
occurred
would
a
reconciliation
be
possible
between
my
father
and
mother
never
all
my
attempts
would
then
be
fruitless
and
then
there
still
remains
the
question
of
material
damage
of
money
squandered
of
dilapidation
but
does
it
fall
on
me
to
put
all
this
in
order
since
i
live
far
away
from
the
house
it
would
require
constant
vigilance
to
do
that
and
only
diego
could
do
it
i
will
speak
to
diego
i
will
arrange
with
him
in
short
the
most
urgent
matter
just
now
is
camille
s
dowry
albert
frequently
brings
the
subject
up
and
is
even
the
most
annoying
of
all
my
solicitors
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
make
some
arrangement
without
difficulty
he
intended
to
favor
his
sister
by
contributing
towards
her
dowry
for
the
heir
of
all
his
uncle
demetrius
s
fortune
he
was
rich
and
already
in
possession
of
his
property
the
intention
to
perform
this
generous
act
raised
him
once
more
in
his
own
conscience
he
believed
himself
freed
from
all
other
duties
from
any
other
disagreeable
step
by
the
sacrifice
which
he
consented
to
make
of
his
money
when
he
turned
his
steps
towards
his
mother
s
room
he
felt
less
uneasy
lighter
more
comfortable
moreover
he
had
learned
that
since
morning
his
father
had
returned
to
the
country
place
where
he
usually
went
in
order
to
have
more
freedom
in
his
actions
and
it
relieved
him
greatly
to
think
that
in
the
evening
at
table
a
certain
place
would
be
vacant
ah
george
you
have
come
just
in
time
cried
his
mother
directly
she
saw
him
enter
the
angry
voice
gave
him
such
a
rude
and
unexpected
shock
that
he
stopped
and
he
looked
at
his
mother
with
stupor
so
transfigured
by
the
transport
of
anger
as
to
be
almost
unrecognizable
he
also
looked
at
diego
not
understanding
he
looked
at
camille
who
stood
still
mute
and
hostile
what
is
the
matter
stammered
george
fixing
his
eyes
once
more
on
his
brother
attracted
by
the
bad
expression
which
he
saw
for
the
first
time
on
the
young
man
s
face
the
strong
box
in
which
the
silverware
is
kept
is
no
longer
in
its
place
said
diego
without
raising
his
eyes
contracting
his
eyebrows
and
mumbling
they
charge
me
with
having
made
away
with
it
a
flood
of
bitter
words
fell
from
the
unhappy
woman
s
mouth
yes
league
with
your
father
you
are
your
father
s
accomplice
oh
what
infamy
and
now
this
frightful
thing
now
this
frightful
thing
the
child
who
has
nursed
at
my
breast
to
turn
against
me
but
you
are
the
only
one
who
resembles
him
god
has
been
more
merciful
with
the
others
o
god
blessed
be
thy
name
blessed
forever
for
having
spared
me
that
supreme
misfortune
you
are
the
only
one
who
resembles
him
the
only
she
turned
towards
george
who
stood
paralyzed
motionless
voiceless
her
chin
trembled
spasmodically
and
she
was
so
convulsed
that
one
would
have
believed
that
she
was
going
to
sink
down
on
the
floor
at
any
moment
do
you
see
now
the
life
that
we
lead
tell
me
do
you
see
it
now
every
day
some
new
infamy
every
day
the
same
struggle
to
prevent
the
pillage
of
this
unfortunate
house
are
you
convinced
now
that
if
your
father
could
he
would
turn
us
into
the
streets
snatch
the
bread
from
our
mouths
and
it
will
come
to
that
we
shall
end
by
seeing
that
you
will
see
you
will
see
she
continued
panting
with
a
choking
sob
in
her
throat
at
every
pause
giving
vent
at
times
to
hoarse
shrieks
which
expressed
an
almost
savage
hate
a
hate
inconceivable
in
a
creature
apparently
so
delicate
and
once
more
accusations
fell
from
her
lips
the
man
had
no
longer
the
slightest
consideration
the
slightest
shame
he
would
stop
at
nothing
and
for
nobody
to
make
money
he
had
become
insane
he
seemed
a
prey
to
uncontrollable
madness
he
had
ruined
his
real
estate
cut
down
his
woods
sold
his
herds
at
hazard
blindly
to
the
first
comer
to
the
one
who
offered
most
now
he
began
to
despoil
the
house
in
which
his
children
were
born
for
a
long
time
he
had
had
designs
upon
the
silver
family
silver
old
and
hereditary
piously
guarded
as
a
relic
of
the
house
of
aurispa
preserved
intact
until
now
hiding
it
had
proved
useless
diego
was
in
league
with
his
father
and
the
two
confederates
eluding
the
keenest
vigilance
had
taken
it
to
do
with
it
god
only
knows
what
have
you
no
shame
she
went
on
turning
towards
diego
who
restrained
with
difficulty
an
explosion
of
his
violence
are
you
not
ashamed
to
take
part
with
your
father
against
me
who
have
never
refused
you
anything
who
have
always
done
as
you
wished
and
yet
you
know
you
know
perfectly
well
where
the
silver
has
gone
and
you
are
not
ashamed
you
ve
nothing
to
say
won
t
you
answer
look
there
s
your
brother
tell
me
where
the
box
has
gone
i
must
know
do
you
hear
i
have
already
said
that
i
don
t
know
that
i
haven
t
seen
the
box
and
that
i
did
not
take
it
cried
diego
unable
to
longer
contain
himself
with
an
explosion
of
brutality
and
shaking
his
head
and
the
sombre
flame
which
lit
up
his
face
made
him
resemble
the
absentee
do
you
understand
the
mother
pale
as
death
looked
at
george
to
whom
the
look
seemed
to
impart
a
similar
color
seized
with
a
fit
of
trembling
impossible
to
hide
the
elder
brother
said
to
the
younger
diego
leave
the
room
i
ll
leave
when
it
pleases
me
replied
diego
insolently
shrugging
his
shoulders
without
however
looking
his
brother
in
the
face
then
a
sudden
exasperation
seized
george
one
of
those
extreme
exasperations
which
in
feeble
and
irresolute
men
have
such
an
excessive
vehemence
that
they
can
not
manifest
themselves
by
any
external
act
but
cause
to
pass
before
the
thwarted
will
flashes
of
criminal
visions
the
hatred
between
brothers
that
odious
hate
which
since
the
creation
breeds
secretly
at
the
bottom
of
human
nature
to
break
out
at
the
first
discord
more
ferocious
than
every
other
inexplicable
hostility
which
exists
latent
between
the
males
of
the
same
blood
even
though
the
customs
and
peace
of
the
birthplace
have
created
between
them
affectionate
bonds
and
also
that
horror
which
accompanies
the
execution
or
the
thought
of
a
crime
and
which
is
perhaps
only
the
vague
sentiment
of
the
law
inscribed
by
secular
heredity
in
the
christian
this
surged
confusedly
in
a
sort
of
vertiginous
whirl
which
for
a
second
superseded
all
other
sentiment
in
his
soul
and
gave
him
an
aggressive
impulse
the
very
aspect
of
diego
his
and
sanguine
body
his
fallow
head
on
the
neck
the
evident
physical
superiority
of
this
robust
muscular
fellow
the
offence
against
his
authority
as
the
contributed
to
augment
his
fury
he
would
like
to
have
had
a
prompt
means
of
dominating
subjugating
felling
this
brute
without
resistance
and
without
a
struggle
instinctively
he
looked
at
his
fists
those
large
powerful
fists
covered
with
a
reddish
down
which
at
dinner
employed
in
the
service
of
a
voracious
appetite
had
already
caused
him
such
a
strong
repulsion
leave
the
room
leave
the
room
immediately
he
repeated
in
a
higher
and
more
commanding
key
or
else
ask
my
mother
s
pardon
immediately
he
advanced
towards
diego
his
hand
extended
as
if
to
grasp
an
arm
i
do
not
permit
anyone
to
give
me
orders
cried
diego
at
last
looking
his
elder
brother
in
the
face
and
beneath
his
low
forehead
his
little
gray
eyes
expressed
a
resentment
which
had
been
brooding
for
years
take
care
diego
you
don
t
frighten
me
take
care
who
are
you
i
d
like
to
know
what
business
have
you
here
shouted
diego
angrily
you
have
no
right
to
interfere
you
are
a
stranger
i
do
not
want
to
know
you
what
has
been
your
rôle
up
to
now
you
have
never
done
anything
for
anybody
you
have
always
thought
only
of
your
comfort
and
your
interest
the
caresses
the
preferences
the
adorations
have
all
been
for
you
what
do
you
want
now
go
back
to
rome
and
squander
your
heritage
as
you
choose
but
don
t
meddle
in
what
does
not
concern
you
so
he
breathed
out
all
his
rancor
all
his
jealousy
all
his
envious
hate
against
the
fortunate
brother
who
in
the
great
city
yonder
lived
a
life
of
unknown
pleasures
a
stranger
to
his
family
as
though
a
being
of
another
race
favored
by
a
thousand
privileges
hold
your
tongue
hold
your
tongue
and
the
mother
beside
herself
and
throwing
herself
between
them
slapped
diego
s
face
leave
the
room
not
another
word
get
out
of
here
go
to
your
father
i
don
t
want
to
hear
you
any
more
i
don
t
even
want
to
see
you
again
diego
hesitated
shaken
by
the
quivering
of
fury
perhaps
only
waiting
for
a
gesture
from
his
brother
to
fling
himself
on
him
go
repeated
the
mother
at
the
end
of
her
energy
and
she
fell
fainting
into
camille
s
arms
extended
to
receive
her
then
diego
went
out
livid
with
rage
muttering
between
his
teeth
a
word
which
george
did
not
understand
and
they
heard
his
heavy
steps
grow
fainter
as
he
passed
through
the
gloomy
enfilade
of
rooms
in
which
the
daylight
was
already
dying
it
was
a
rainy
evening
stretched
out
on
his
bed
george
felt
himself
so
broken
physically
and
so
sad
that
he
had
given
up
thinking
so
to
speak
his
thoughts
wavered
vague
and
incoherent
but
his
sadness
was
modified
and
exasperated
by
the
influence
of
the
slightest
words
pronounced
in
the
street
by
passersby
the
of
the
clock
on
the
wall
the
tinkling
of
a
distant
bell
the
stamping
of
a
horse
a
whistle
the
banging
of
a
door
he
felt
alone
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
separated
from
his
own
anterior
existence
by
the
abyss
of
incalculable
time
his
imagination
represented
to
him
in
an
indistinct
vision
the
gesture
with
which
his
mistress
had
lowered
her
black
veil
after
the
last
kiss
it
represented
to
him
the
child
with
the
crutch
collecting
the
waxen
tears
he
thought
there
is
nothing
more
left
to
me
but
to
die
without
definite
cause
his
anguish
increased
all
at
once
and
became
unbearable
the
palpitations
of
his
heart
choked
him
as
if
in
a
nightmare
he
threw
himself
from
his
bed
and
paced
up
and
down
his
room
distracted
agitated
incapable
of
containing
his
anguish
and
his
steps
resounded
in
his
brain
who
is
there
someone
calling
me
the
sound
of
a
voice
rang
in
his
ear
he
strained
his
ear
to
listen
he
heard
nothing
more
he
opened
the
door
walked
in
the
corridor
and
listened
all
was
silent
his
aunt
s
room
was
open
and
lit
up
a
strange
fear
seized
him
a
sort
of
panicky
terror
as
he
thought
that
he
might
all
at
once
see
that
old
woman
with
the
mask
of
a
cadaver
appear
on
the
threshold
one
doubt
crossed
his
mind
she
was
perhaps
dead
seated
over
there
in
her
motionless
her
chin
on
her
this
vision
had
the
clearness
of
reality
and
froze
him
with
veritable
fright
he
did
not
stir
no
longer
dared
make
a
movement
standing
still
with
a
band
of
iron
around
his
head
a
band
which
like
some
cold
and
elastic
substance
expanded
and
contracted
according
to
the
pulsation
of
his
arteries
his
nerves
tyrannized
him
imposing
on
him
the
disorder
the
excess
of
their
sensations
the
old
woman
commenced
to
cough
and
that
made
him
start
then
he
retired
softly
quietly
on
tiptoe
so
as
not
to
be
heard
what
is
the
matter
with
me
this
evening
i
can
not
stay
any
longer
alone
in
this
room
i
must
go
down
besides
he
foresaw
that
after
the
atrocious
scene
it
would
be
equally
impossible
for
him
to
bear
his
mother
s
unhappy
appearance
i
will
go
out
i
will
go
to
christine
s
what
prompted
him
to
make
this
visit
was
the
recollection
of
the
touching
and
sad
hour
spent
with
his
sweet
sister
in
the
garden
it
was
a
rainy
evening
in
the
streets
already
almost
deserted
the
few
threw
out
a
dull
glow
from
a
closed
bakery
came
the
voices
of
the
bakers
at
work
and
an
odor
of
bread
from
a
cabaret
came
the
sounds
of
a
guitar
and
the
refrain
of
a
popular
air
a
band
of
wandering
dogs
ran
by
and
was
lost
in
the
sombre
alleys
the
hour
struck
in
the
belfry
by
degrees
the
walk
in
the
open
air
calmed
his
exaltation
he
seemed
to
have
freed
himself
from
the
phantasies
which
encumbered
his
conscience
his
attention
was
attracted
to
all
he
saw
and
heard
he
stopped
to
listen
to
the
sounds
of
the
guitar
to
smell
the
odor
of
the
bread
someone
passed
in
the
shadow
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
he
thought
he
recognized
diego
meeting
him
caused
him
agitation
but
he
felt
that
all
his
rancor
was
gone
that
no
violence
remained
at
the
bottom
of
his
sorrow
certain
of
his
brother
s
words
came
back
to
his
memory
he
thought
who
knows
if
he
did
not
speak
the
truth
i
have
never
done
anything
for
anybody
i
have
always
lived
for
myself
alone
here
i
am
a
stranger
everyone
here
judges
me
perhaps
in
the
same
way
my
mother
said
you
see
now
the
life
we
lead
you
see
now
don
t
you
i
might
see
all
her
tears
flow
and
still
should
not
have
the
strength
to
save
her
he
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
celaia
palace
he
entered
and
crossed
the
vestibule
as
he
traversed
the
court
he
raised
his
eyes
not
a
light
was
visible
at
any
of
the
high
windows
there
was
in
the
air
an
odor
of
rotten
straw
the
tap
of
a
dripped
in
an
obscure
angle
beneath
the
portico
beneath
an
image
of
the
virgin
covered
with
a
grating
a
little
lantern
was
burning
and
through
the
grating
at
the
feet
of
the
virgin
could
be
seen
a
bouquet
of
artificial
roses
the
steps
of
the
large
stairway
were
hollowed
in
the
centre
by
usage
like
those
of
an
antique
altar
and
every
hollow
in
the
stone
shone
with
yellowish
reflections
everything
expressed
the
melancholy
of
the
old
hereditary
house
to
which
don
bartolomeo
celaia
left
to
solitude
and
arrived
at
the
threshold
of
old
age
had
conducted
his
bride
and
in
which
he
had
begotten
his
heir
as
he
went
upstairs
george
saw
with
the
eyes
of
his
soul
the
young
pensive
wife
and
the
anæmic
child
he
saw
them
in
the
distance
at
a
chimerical
distance
at
the
end
of
an
room
to
which
nobody
could
penetrate
for
a
moment
he
had
the
idea
to
turn
back
and
he
stopped
perplexed
in
the
middle
of
the
high
and
silent
white
staircase
he
was
in
a
state
of
indefinable
uneasiness
once
more
he
had
lost
the
sense
of
the
present
reality
he
felt
himself
once
more
under
the
influence
of
a
vague
terror
like
a
short
time
before
in
the
corridor
when
he
had
perceived
the
door
open
and
the
room
empty
but
suddenly
he
heard
a
noise
and
a
voice
as
if
someone
were
chasing
something
and
a
gray
dog
a
gaunt
and
mongrel
doubtless
driven
to
enter
the
house
by
hunger
came
flying
down
the
stairway
half
a
dozen
steps
at
a
time
and
brushed
by
him
a
servant
noisily
chasing
the
fugitive
appeared
on
the
landing
what
is
the
matter
asked
george
visibly
agitated
by
the
surprise
oh
nothing
sir
i
am
chasing
a
dog
an
ugly
dirty
beast
that
gets
into
the
house
every
night
no
one
knows
how
just
like
a
ghost
this
trifling
insignificant
fact
combined
with
the
servant
s
words
aroused
in
him
that
inexplicable
uneasiness
which
resembled
the
confused
anguish
of
a
superstitious
presentiment
it
was
this
anguish
which
prompted
the
question
is
luchino
well
yes
sir
thanks
to
god
is
he
asleep
no
sir
he
has
not
yet
gone
to
bed
preceded
by
the
domestic
he
crossed
the
large
rooms
which
seemed
almost
empty
and
in
which
the
furniture
in
design
was
placed
symmetrically
nothing
indicated
the
presence
of
inhabitants
as
if
the
rooms
had
remained
closed
up
to
then
and
he
said
to
himself
that
christine
could
not
love
this
dwelling
since
she
had
not
shed
over
it
the
grace
of
her
soul
everything
had
remained
there
just
as
it
was
in
the
same
order
in
which
the
bride
found
it
on
entering
on
her
in
the
same
order
left
by
the
last
of
the
wives
of
the
house
of
celaia
george
s
unexpected
visit
delighted
his
sister
who
was
alone
and
preparing
to
put
the
child
to
bed
oh
george
how
good
you
are
to
have
come
she
exclaimed
with
an
effusion
of
sincere
joy
pressing
him
in
her
arms
and
kissing
his
forehead
and
this
tenderness
had
the
immediate
effect
of
dilating
her
brother
s
depressed
heart
look
luchino
look
there
s
your
uncle
george
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
him
come
give
him
a
kiss
a
feeble
smile
appeared
upon
the
child
s
pale
mouth
and
as
he
had
lowered
his
head
his
long
blond
eyelashes
were
lit
up
from
above
and
threw
their
trembling
shadow
on
his
blanched
cheeks
george
took
him
in
his
arms
unable
to
prevent
a
sensation
of
profound
emotion
in
feeling
beneath
his
hands
the
leanness
of
the
child
s
chest
in
which
beat
so
debilitated
a
heart
and
he
was
almost
afraid
as
if
his
slight
pressure
were
sufficient
to
extinguish
the
pitiful
little
life
he
felt
both
fear
and
pity
as
he
used
to
do
in
his
boyhood
when
he
held
a
little
scared
bird
prisoner
in
his
hand
light
as
a
feather
he
said
the
emotion
which
trembled
in
his
voice
did
not
escape
christine
he
seated
the
child
on
his
knees
caressed
his
head
and
asked
him
do
you
love
me
very
much
his
heart
was
filled
with
unusual
tenderness
he
felt
a
melancholy
desire
to
see
the
poor
sickly
child
smile
to
see
his
cheeks
tinted
at
least
once
a
fleeting
rouge
to
see
a
light
effusion
of
blood
beneath
the
diaphanous
skin
what
have
you
here
he
asked
seeing
a
finger
wrapped
up
in
linen
he
cut
himself
the
other
day
said
christine
whose
attentive
eyes
followed
her
brother
s
slightest
gestures
a
slight
cut
but
it
is
obstinate
in
healing
let
me
see
luchino
said
george
prompted
by
a
painful
curiosity
but
smiling
to
call
forth
a
smile
i
will
cure
it
by
blowing
on
it
the
child
surprised
permitted
the
bandage
to
be
removed
from
his
finger
watched
anxiously
by
his
sister
george
took
infinite
precautions
in
untying
it
the
end
of
the
linen
had
adhered
to
the
slight
wound
and
he
had
not
the
heart
to
detach
it
but
at
the
edge
exposed
to
view
he
saw
appear
a
whitish
drop
resembling
whey
his
lips
trembled
he
raised
his
eyes
he
saw
that
the
face
of
his
sister
intent
on
his
every
movement
had
undergone
a
change
and
was
contracted
by
grief
he
felt
that
at
that
moment
the
poor
woman
s
soul
was
wholly
concentrated
in
that
little
hand
it
is
nothing
he
said
and
he
forced
a
smile
as
he
breathed
on
the
cut
to
give
the
illusion
to
the
child
who
was
waiting
for
the
miracle
then
he
rebound
the
finger
with
infinite
care
he
thought
once
more
of
the
strange
anguish
which
had
seized
him
on
the
deserted
staircase
of
the
chase
after
the
dog
of
the
servant
s
words
of
the
questions
which
a
superstitious
fear
had
suggested
to
him
of
all
his
baseless
anxiety
noticing
how
absorbed
he
was
christine
said
to
him
what
are
you
thinking
of
nothing
then
all
at
once
without
thinking
without
having
any
other
intention
than
to
say
something
which
would
arouse
the
attention
of
the
already
sleepy
child
he
said
do
you
know
i
met
a
dog
on
the
staircase
the
child
opened
wide
his
eyes
a
dog
which
comes
every
night
yes
said
christine
gian
spoke
to
me
about
it
but
she
stopped
at
the
appearance
of
the
dilated
and
terrified
eyes
of
the
child
who
was
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
sobs
no
no
luchino
no
no
it
s
not
true
she
cried
lifting
him
from
george
s
knees
and
pressing
him
to
her
bosom
no
it
s
not
true
your
uncle
said
that
for
fun
it
s
not
true
it
s
not
true
repeated
george
rising
in
consternation
at
these
tears
which
no
other
child
would
weep
for
they
seemed
to
ravage
the
poor
creature
come
come
said
the
mother
in
a
coaxing
tone
luchino
s
going
to
bed
now
isn
t
he
she
passed
into
the
adjoining
room
still
caressing
and
rocking
her
weeping
child
come
too
george
while
she
undressed
the
child
george
watched
her
she
undressed
him
slowly
with
infinite
precautions
as
if
she
were
afraid
to
break
him
and
each
of
his
gestures
showed
sadly
the
wretchedness
of
his
slender
limbs
which
already
began
to
show
the
deformities
of
an
incurable
rachitis
the
neck
was
long
and
flexible
like
a
withered
stem
the
breastplate
the
ribs
the
almost
visible
through
the
skin
making
a
projection
which
the
shadows
cast
in
the
hollowed
parts
accentuated
even
more
strongly
the
enlarged
knees
appeared
to
be
knotted
the
abdomen
somewhat
swollen
the
navel
projecting
rendering
still
more
prominent
the
angular
leanness
of
the
hips
when
the
child
raised
its
arms
while
the
mother
changed
its
chemise
george
felt
a
painful
pity
almost
an
anguish
on
perceiving
the
fragile
little
which
in
this
simple
act
appeared
to
express
the
difficulty
of
an
effort
required
to
overcome
the
deathly
languor
in
which
this
feeble
life
was
on
the
point
of
being
extinguished
kiss
him
said
christine
to
george
and
she
held
the
child
out
to
him
before
putting
him
beneath
the
bedclothes
then
she
took
the
child
s
hands
carried
that
having
the
bandaged
finger
from
the
face
to
the
chest
then
from
the
left
to
the
right
shoulder
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
then
she
joined
them
saying
amen
in
all
this
there
was
a
funereal
solemnness
the
child
in
his
long
white
had
already
the
appearance
of
a
little
corpse
sleep
now
sleep
my
love
we
will
stay
near
you
the
brother
and
sister
united
once
more
in
the
same
sorrow
sat
down
one
on
each
side
of
his
bed
they
spoke
no
more
the
odor
of
the
medicines
heaped
together
on
a
table
near
the
bed
pervaded
the
room
a
fly
detached
itself
from
the
wall
flew
with
a
loud
buzz
towards
the
flame
of
the
lamp
and
alighted
on
the
coverlid
a
piece
of
furniture
creaked
in
the
heavy
silence
he
is
falling
asleep
said
george
in
a
low
voice
both
were
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
the
child
s
slumber
which
suggested
to
both
the
image
of
death
a
species
of
oppressive
stupor
dominated
them
without
their
being
able
to
distract
their
thoughts
from
the
picture
an
indefinite
time
passed
suddenly
the
child
gave
a
frightful
cry
opened
wide
his
eyes
raised
himself
on
his
pillow
as
if
terrified
by
some
horrible
vision
mamma
mamma
what
is
it
what
is
it
my
love
mamma
what
is
it
my
love
i
am
here
chase
it
away
chase
it
away
vi
at
supper
at
which
diego
had
abstained
from
showing
himself
had
not
camilla
repeated
the
accusation
in
a
veiled
form
when
she
said
when
the
eyes
do
not
see
the
heart
does
not
suffer
and
in
his
mother
s
words
how
quickly
his
mother
had
forgotten
the
tears
with
which
the
conversation
at
the
window
had
ended
in
his
mother
s
words
had
the
accusation
not
cropped
up
several
times
george
thought
not
without
bitterness
everybody
here
judges
me
in
the
same
way
in
short
nobody
forgives
me
either
for
my
voluntary
renunciation
of
my
rights
as
the
eldest
or
for
the
inheritance
left
me
by
my
uncle
demetrius
i
ought
to
have
stayed
at
home
to
look
after
the
conduct
of
my
father
and
my
brother
to
defend
the
domestic
happiness
according
to
them
nothing
would
have
happened
if
i
had
remained
here
consequently
i
am
the
guilty
one
and
this
is
the
expiation
the
farther
he
advanced
in
the
direction
of
the
suburban
villa
to
which
the
enemy
had
retired
and
towards
which
he
had
been
pushed
by
extreme
measures
by
merciless
cudgel
blows
so
to
speak
the
more
he
felt
the
weight
of
a
kind
of
vexatious
oppression
the
indignation
provoked
by
an
unjust
compulsion
he
was
in
fact
in
his
own
eyes
the
victim
of
cruel
and
implacable
persons
who
were
unwilling
to
spare
him
any
kind
of
torture
and
the
recollection
of
certain
phrases
uttered
by
his
mother
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
amid
their
joint
tears
augmented
his
bitterness
soured
his
irony
no
george
no
it
is
not
for
you
to
suffer
i
ought
to
have
said
nothing
i
shouldn
t
have
told
you
don
t
cry
any
more
i
can
t
bear
to
see
you
cry
and
nevertheless
since
that
day
no
kind
of
torture
had
been
spared
him
that
little
scene
had
not
made
any
change
in
his
mother
s
attitude
towards
him
the
following
day
and
ever
since
she
had
been
just
as
angry
and
violent
she
had
insisted
on
his
listening
over
and
over
again
to
old
and
new
accusations
aggravated
by
a
thousand
odious
particulars
she
had
morally
forced
him
to
count
on
her
face
one
by
one
the
marks
of
the
suffering
endured
she
had
almost
said
to
him
see
how
my
eyes
are
scorched
by
tears
how
deep
my
wrinkles
have
become
how
white
my
hair
has
grown
at
the
temples
and
what
would
it
be
could
i
show
you
my
heart
what
had
been
the
good
therefore
of
the
grief
of
the
other
day
was
it
necessary
for
his
mother
to
see
burning
tears
shed
to
be
moved
to
pity
then
she
did
not
appreciate
the
cruelty
of
the
pain
she
inflicted
uselessly
on
her
son
oh
how
rare
on
earth
are
those
beings
who
know
how
to
suffer
in
silence
and
accept
the
sacrifice
with
a
smile
still
disturbed
and
exasperated
by
the
recent
excesses
of
which
he
had
been
an
involuntary
witness
already
pervaded
by
the
horror
of
the
decisive
act
which
he
was
preparing
to
accomplish
he
had
thus
come
to
despise
his
mother
to
the
point
of
complaining
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
suffer
with
sufficient
perfection
the
farther
he
advanced
on
his
way
he
had
not
wished
to
take
the
carriage
and
had
started
on
foot
so
as
to
be
free
to
lengthen
at
his
will
the
time
of
the
journey
and
perhaps
also
to
have
the
possibility
at
the
last
moment
of
retracing
his
steps
or
to
lose
himself
on
the
country
roads
farther
he
advanced
he
felt
grow
that
indomitable
horror
so
much
so
that
finally
it
surmounted
every
other
sentiment
and
masked
every
other
thought
the
one
image
of
his
father
occupied
his
mind
and
with
the
relief
of
an
actual
figure
and
he
began
to
imagine
the
scene
which
would
take
place
studied
the
countenance
which
he
would
assume
prepared
his
first
sentences
lost
himself
in
improbable
hypotheses
explored
the
most
distant
memories
of
his
childhood
and
adolescence
tried
to
represent
the
successive
attitudes
of
his
soul
towards
his
father
during
the
successive
periods
of
his
past
life
he
thought
perhaps
i
have
never
loved
him
and
in
fact
in
not
one
of
his
clearest
recollections
did
he
find
a
spontaneous
movement
of
confidence
or
a
warm
effusion
of
tenderness
or
an
intimate
and
agreeable
emotion
what
he
did
find
in
the
memories
of
his
early
childhood
was
a
continual
fear
which
oppressed
all
fear
of
corporal
punishment
of
cross
words
followed
by
blows
i
have
never
loved
him
demetrius
had
been
his
real
father
he
was
his
sole
and
only
parent
and
he
appeared
to
his
mind
a
mild
meditative
man
with
a
face
full
of
a
virile
melancholy
and
a
single
white
curl
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
among
the
black
hair
giving
him
an
odd
appearance
as
always
the
image
of
the
dead
man
solaced
him
immediately
and
banished
from
his
mind
the
things
which
had
just
preoccupied
him
his
uneasiness
became
composed
his
bitterness
disappeared
and
his
repugnance
gave
place
to
a
new
sensation
of
tranquil
security
what
had
he
to
fear
why
did
his
imagination
exaggerate
so
childishly
the
suffering
which
awaited
him
and
which
henceforth
was
inevitable
and
once
more
he
had
the
intimate
consciousness
that
he
had
radically
transported
himself
from
his
present
life
from
the
present
state
of
his
being
from
the
contingencies
which
had
most
troubled
him
once
more
under
the
influence
that
his
uncle
exercised
on
him
from
the
depth
of
his
tomb
he
felt
himself
enveloped
by
a
sort
of
isolating
atmosphere
and
lost
the
precise
notion
of
what
had
occurred
and
what
was
still
going
to
occur
the
real
events
seemed
to
be
divested
of
all
significance
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
and
to
have
but
a
momentary
importance
it
was
like
the
resignation
of
a
man
whom
fatality
obliged
to
submit
to
a
trial
in
order
to
attain
the
future
deliverance
of
which
his
soul
had
already
had
the
prevision
and
certitude
this
interruption
of
internal
care
this
singular
respite
which
he
had
obtained
without
effort
and
which
did
not
surprise
him
permitted
his
eyes
to
be
opened
finally
to
the
spectacle
of
the
solitary
and
magnificent
landscape
the
attention
he
gave
to
it
was
calm
and
serene
in
the
aspect
of
the
country
he
believed
he
recognized
a
symbol
of
his
own
sentiments
and
a
visible
imprint
of
his
thoughts
it
was
the
afternoon
a
clear
and
liquid
sky
bathed
all
the
terrestrial
objects
in
its
own
color
and
appeared
to
subtilize
all
matter
by
an
infinitely
slow
penetration
the
various
forms
of
vegetation
distinct
close
by
became
effaced
in
the
distance
lost
by
degrees
their
contours
appeared
to
evaporate
at
the
top
tended
to
become
combined
into
a
single
form
immense
and
confused
which
a
single
rhythmic
respiration
would
animate
little
by
little
beneath
a
deluge
of
azure
the
hills
became
equal
in
size
and
the
depths
of
the
valley
took
on
the
appearance
of
a
peaceful
gulf
which
reflected
the
sky
from
this
united
gulf
the
isolated
mass
of
the
mountain
soared
up
opposing
to
the
liquid
space
the
immovable
solidity
of
its
ridges
which
the
whiteness
of
the
snows
illumined
with
an
almost
supernatural
light
vii
at
last
the
villa
appeared
between
the
trees
close
by
with
its
two
broad
lateral
terraces
provided
with
balustrades
supported
by
little
stone
pilasters
and
ornamented
with
vases
in
the
shape
of
busts
representing
kings
and
queens
upon
whose
heads
the
sharp
points
of
the
aloes
formed
living
crowns
the
view
of
these
coarse
reddish
figures
several
of
which
stood
out
clearly
outlined
against
the
luminous
azure
suddenly
awakened
in
george
new
memories
of
his
distant
childhood
confused
recollections
of
rural
recreations
of
sports
of
races
of
romances
imagined
concerning
these
motionless
and
deaf
kings
in
whose
hearts
of
clay
the
tenacious
plants
had
fastened
their
roots
he
even
recalled
that
he
had
long
had
a
predilection
for
a
queen
whose
thick
and
long
hair
was
formed
by
the
hanging
foliage
of
a
fertile
plant
which
in
spring
dotted
it
with
innumerable
golden
flowerets
he
looked
for
her
with
curiosity
while
in
his
mind
he
multiplied
the
images
of
the
obscure
and
intense
life
with
which
his
childish
phantasy
had
animated
her
as
he
recognized
her
on
a
corner
pilaster
he
smiled
as
if
he
had
recognized
a
friend
and
for
several
seconds
all
his
soul
inclined
towards
the
irrevocable
past
with
an
agitation
which
was
not
without
sweetness
thanks
to
the
final
resolution
which
had
assumed
shape
in
him
since
his
unexpected
calmness
in
the
midst
of
the
pale
green
and
silent
country
he
found
now
in
his
sensations
a
forgotten
savor
and
took
pleasure
in
tracing
to
its
most
remote
sinuosities
the
course
of
his
own
existence
so
close
thenceforth
to
the
end
determined
upon
this
curiosity
for
the
manifestations
even
the
most
fugitive
that
his
being
had
dispersed
in
the
past
this
agitated
sympathy
for
the
things
with
which
he
had
formerly
been
in
affinity
tended
to
change
into
a
languishing
tearful
and
almost
feminine
tenderness
but
when
he
heard
voices
near
the
railing
he
shook
off
this
languor
and
when
he
perceived
an
open
window
at
which
the
cage
of
a
hung
between
the
white
curtains
he
came
back
to
the
sentiment
of
the
present
reality
and
felt
anew
his
previous
anguish
the
surroundings
were
calm
and
one
could
distinctly
hear
the
singing
of
the
imprisoned
bird
my
visit
is
unexpected
he
said
to
himself
his
heart
sinking
if
that
woman
should
be
with
him
near
the
railing
he
saw
the
children
playing
in
the
sand
and
without
having
time
to
observe
them
he
guessed
they
were
his
adulterine
brothers
the
sons
of
the
concubine
he
advanced
and
the
two
children
turned
round
began
to
gaze
at
him
with
astonishment
but
without
intimidation
healthy
robust
flourishing
with
cheeks
crimson
with
health
they
bore
the
manifest
imprint
of
their
origin
the
sight
of
them
upset
him
an
irresistible
terror
assailed
him
he
had
the
idea
of
hiding
himself
to
turn
back
to
flee
and
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
window
with
the
fear
of
perceiving
between
the
curtains
the
face
of
his
father
or
that
of
the
odious
woman
of
whose
perfidies
covetousness
turpitudes
he
had
so
often
been
told
ah
you
here
sir
it
was
the
voice
of
a
domestic
who
came
to
meet
him
at
the
same
time
his
father
cried
to
him
from
the
window
is
that
you
george
what
a
surprise
he
resummoned
his
courage
composed
his
face
into
a
smile
and
tried
to
assume
an
air
of
unconcern
he
had
felt
that
already
between
his
father
and
himself
had
just
been
reëstablished
those
artificial
relations
almost
ceremonious
in
form
which
they
had
used
for
several
years
towards
one
another
in
order
to
hide
their
embarrassment
when
they
found
themselves
in
immediate
and
inevitable
contact
and
he
had
felt
besides
that
his
will
had
just
totally
left
him
and
that
he
would
never
be
capable
to
expose
frankly
the
true
motive
of
his
unexpected
visit
aren
t
you
coming
up
said
his
father
to
him
from
the
window
yes
i
am
coming
up
he
would
have
liked
to
make
believe
that
he
had
not
noticed
the
two
children
he
started
to
go
up
by
the
stairway
leading
to
one
of
the
large
terraces
his
father
came
to
meet
him
they
embraced
there
always
was
in
his
father
s
manner
a
manifest
ostentation
of
affection
so
you
finally
decided
to
come
i
wanted
a
walk
and
it
landed
me
here
i
have
not
seen
the
place
for
so
long
it
s
just
as
it
always
was
it
seems
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
terrace
he
examined
the
busts
one
after
the
other
with
more
curiosity
than
was
natural
you
re
almost
always
here
now
aren
t
you
he
said
in
order
to
say
something
to
escape
the
embarrassing
intervals
of
silence
which
he
foresaw
would
grow
longer
and
more
frequent
yes
i
come
here
often
now
and
stay
here
replied
his
father
with
a
shade
of
sadness
in
his
voice
which
surprised
his
son
i
believe
the
air
does
me
my
heart
began
to
trouble
me
is
your
heart
affected
cried
george
turning
towards
him
with
sincere
emotion
struck
by
the
unexpectedness
of
the
news
how
since
when
i
never
knew
anything
of
has
ever
breathed
a
word
of
it
to
me
he
looked
now
at
his
father
s
face
in
the
strong
light
shed
by
the
sun
s
oblique
rays
and
reflected
by
the
wall
and
fancied
he
could
detect
the
symptoms
of
the
mortal
malady
and
it
was
with
sympathetic
compassion
that
he
remarked
the
deep
wrinkles
the
swollen
eyes
the
white
hairs
that
bristled
on
the
unshaven
cheeks
and
chin
his
mustache
and
hair
to
which
the
dye
gave
an
indefinite
color
between
a
greenish
and
a
violet
the
thick
lips
through
which
the
respiration
came
like
the
gasping
of
asthma
the
short
neck
which
appeared
to
be
colored
by
an
extravasation
of
blood
since
when
he
repeated
without
concealing
his
anxiety
and
he
felt
his
repugnance
to
this
man
diminish
as
a
rapid
succession
of
images
clear
almost
as
the
reality
might
be
represented
him
beneath
the
menace
of
death
disfigured
by
the
death
agony
does
one
ever
know
when
it
begins
answered
his
father
who
in
the
presence
of
his
son
s
sincere
emotion
exaggerated
his
suffering
in
order
to
sustain
and
increase
a
pity
by
which
he
might
succeed
perhaps
in
profiting
can
one
ever
tell
when
it
begins
these
kind
of
maladies
breed
for
years
and
then
one
fine
day
suddenly
make
their
presence
felt
then
there
is
no
remedy
one
must
be
resigned
await
the
end
from
one
minute
to
speaking
in
this
strain
in
a
changed
voice
he
seemed
to
lose
his
hardness
and
massive
brutality
to
become
older
more
feeble
more
of
a
physical
and
moral
wreck
it
was
like
a
sudden
dissolution
of
his
entire
person
yet
with
an
artificiality
exaggeration
and
theatricalism
which
did
not
escape
george
s
perspicacity
and
the
young
man
thought
instantly
of
those
comedians
who
on
the
stage
have
the
facility
of
instantly
undergoing
a
metamorphosis
as
they
take
off
and
replace
a
mask
he
had
even
a
sudden
intuition
of
what
was
about
to
follow
without
doubt
his
father
had
divined
the
motive
of
this
unexpected
visit
and
now
he
sought
to
obtain
some
useful
effect
by
the
exhibition
of
his
malady
doubtless
too
he
purposed
to
attain
some
definite
object
what
was
that
object
george
felt
no
indignation
no
internal
anger
he
made
no
preparation
either
to
defend
himself
against
the
ambush
which
he
foresaw
with
such
certitude
on
the
contrary
his
inertia
increased
in
proportion
to
his
lucidity
and
he
waited
for
the
comedy
to
follow
its
course
ready
to
accept
all
that
might
happen
sad
and
resigned
will
you
come
in
said
his
father
if
you
like
very
well
let
us
go
in
i
have
some
papers
i
wish
to
show
you
the
father
passed
in
first
directing
his
steps
towards
the
room
the
open
window
of
which
shed
over
the
entire
villa
the
singing
of
the
george
followed
him
without
looking
around
he
perceived
that
his
father
had
also
changed
his
walk
so
as
to
simulate
fatigue
and
it
gave
him
a
poignant
chagrin
to
think
of
the
degrading
impostures
of
which
he
would
soon
be
the
spectator
and
the
victim
he
felt
in
the
house
the
presence
of
the
concubine
he
was
sure
that
she
was
hidden
in
some
room
that
she
was
listening
that
she
was
spying
he
thought
what
papers
is
he
going
to
show
me
what
does
he
expect
to
get
from
me
he
doubtless
wants
money
he
is
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
he
thought
he
could
still
hear
certain
of
his
mother
s
invectives
he
recalled
certain
and
almost
unbelievable
particularities
which
he
had
learned
from
her
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
say
the
canary
in
its
cage
sang
in
a
limpid
and
strong
voice
varying
its
modulations
and
the
white
curtains
puffed
out
like
two
sails
permitting
a
view
of
the
distant
azure
the
breeze
disturbed
some
of
the
papers
that
littered
the
table
and
on
this
table
george
perceived
in
a
crystal
disk
which
served
as
a
a
licentious
vignette
what
a
bad
day
i
have
had
murmured
his
father
who
affecting
to
be
tormented
by
palpitation
of
the
heart
dropped
heavily
into
a
chair
his
eyelids
and
began
to
breathe
like
an
asthmatic
are
you
suffering
said
george
almost
timidly
not
knowing
if
the
suffering
were
real
or
simulated
nor
what
face
he
should
put
upon
the
matter
it
will
pass
in
a
moment
as
soon
as
i
have
the
slightest
excitement
the
least
anxiety
i
feel
worse
i
need
quiet
and
rest
and
on
the
he
began
again
to
speak
in
that
mournful
complaining
tone
which
owing
to
a
vague
resemblance
in
accent
awoke
in
george
the
recollection
of
his
aunt
joconda
the
poor
idiot
when
she
tried
to
excite
his
pity
in
order
to
get
sweetmeats
the
feint
was
now
so
evident
so
vulgar
so
ignoble
and
in
spite
of
all
there
was
so
much
human
misery
in
the
condition
of
this
man
reduced
to
such
base
means
to
satisfy
his
implacable
vice
there
was
so
much
true
suffering
in
the
expression
of
his
lying
face
that
it
appeared
to
george
that
not
one
of
the
sorrows
of
his
past
life
was
comparable
with
the
horrible
anguish
of
that
present
moment
on
the
contrary
he
echoed
to
encourage
his
father
to
continue
as
if
to
hasten
the
end
of
his
own
torture
on
the
contrary
for
some
time
everything
has
been
going
from
bad
to
worse
and
catastrophes
succeed
one
another
without
cease
i
have
had
considerable
losses
three
bad
consecutive
years
the
failure
of
the
vines
the
devastated
flocks
the
rents
reduced
by
half
the
taxes
increased
in
enormous
look
here
here
are
the
papers
i
wished
to
show
you
and
he
took
from
the
table
a
bundle
of
papers
spread
them
out
before
his
son
s
eyes
began
to
explain
confusedly
a
number
of
very
involved
business
matters
relative
to
unpaid
landed
taxes
which
had
accumulated
during
several
months
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
make
a
settlement
at
once
in
order
to
avoid
incalculable
injury
their
effects
had
already
been
attached
and
at
any
moment
the
bills
of
sale
might
be
posted
what
could
be
done
to
remove
the
momentary
embarrassment
in
which
he
found
himself
without
any
fault
of
his
own
the
amount
involved
was
considerable
what
could
be
done
george
was
silent
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
papers
which
his
father
was
turning
over
in
his
almost
monstrous
hand
with
its
visible
pores
and
white
with
a
pallor
that
made
a
singular
contrast
with
his
sanguine
face
at
intervals
he
lost
the
sound
of
the
words
but
in
his
ear
still
sounded
the
monotony
of
that
voice
in
contrast
with
the
shrill
singing
of
the
canary
and
the
intermittent
cries
which
rose
from
the
path
where
the
two
little
bastards
were
still
doubtless
playing
in
the
sand
the
curtains
stirred
in
the
windows
when
an
unusually
strong
breeze
swelled
their
folds
and
all
these
voices
all
these
sounds
bore
an
inexpressible
expression
of
sadness
for
the
silent
visitor
who
regarded
with
a
sort
of
stupor
these
bailiffs
wits
over
which
passed
that
swollen
pale
hand
with
its
small
apparent
scars
left
by
an
image
surged
through
his
memory
a
strangely
distinct
remembrance
of
his
childhood
his
father
was
near
a
window
his
face
grave
his
rolled
up
on
one
arm
which
he
held
plunged
in
a
basin
of
water
and
the
water
was
reddened
by
the
flow
of
blood
from
the
open
vein
and
by
his
side
stood
the
surgeon
watching
the
flow
of
blood
and
holding
the
bandages
ready
for
the
ligature
one
image
recalled
another
he
saw
the
bright
lances
in
the
green
leather
case
he
saw
his
mother
carrying
from
the
room
a
basin
full
of
blood
he
saw
the
hand
held
in
a
sling
by
a
black
ribbon
which
was
crossed
on
his
fleshy
soft
back
sinking
into
it
a
little
noticing
his
pensiveness
his
father
asked
him
are
you
listening
to
me
yes
i
am
listening
at
that
moment
the
father
perhaps
expected
a
spontaneous
offer
disappointed
he
made
a
slight
pause
then
surmounting
his
embarrassment
said
bartolomeo
could
save
me
if
he
gave
me
the
amount
he
hesitated
and
his
physiognomy
took
on
an
indefinable
expression
in
which
the
son
believed
he
recognized
the
last
symptom
of
a
modesty
vanquished
by
the
almost
desperate
necessity
of
attaining
his
object
he
would
give
me
this
sum
for
a
note
believe
he
would
require
your
signature
at
last
the
trap
was
sprung
ah
my
signature
stammered
george
embarrassed
not
at
the
demand
but
at
the
odious
name
of
this
whom
the
maternal
accusations
had
already
presented
to
him
as
a
bird
of
ill
omen
eager
to
prey
upon
the
remains
of
the
house
of
the
aurispas
and
as
he
remained
perplexed
and
gloomy
without
saying
anything
the
father
fearing
a
refusal
laid
aside
all
reserve
and
had
recourse
to
supplications
that
was
the
only
way
now
to
avoid
a
disastrous
judicial
sale
which
would
certainly
determine
all
his
other
creditors
to
swoop
down
on
him
disaster
would
be
inevitable
did
his
son
wish
to
be
a
witness
of
his
ruin
or
did
he
not
understand
that
by
interposing
in
this
instance
he
would
act
for
his
own
interest
and
protect
a
heritage
which
was
soon
to
come
to
his
brother
and
himself
oh
it
won
t
be
so
long
it
will
come
from
one
day
to
the
other
perhaps
and
he
began
again
to
speak
of
his
incurable
malady
of
the
continual
peril
that
threatened
him
of
his
worries
and
troubles
that
were
hastening
the
hour
of
his
death
at
the
end
of
his
strength
unable
to
stand
longer
that
voice
and
this
scene
yet
restrained
nevertheless
by
the
thought
of
his
other
who
had
forced
him
to
this
place
and
who
now
awaited
him
to
demand
an
account
of
his
stammered
but
will
you
really
use
this
money
for
the
purpose
you
have
stated
so
you
too
you
too
cried
his
father
who
beneath
an
apparent
explosion
of
sorrow
repressed
clumsily
one
of
his
violent
fits
so
they
have
been
telling
you
too
what
is
always
being
gossiped
about
i
am
a
monster
that
i
have
committed
every
crime
that
i
am
capable
of
every
infamy
and
you
have
believed
it
too
why
why
do
they
hate
me
to
this
extent
in
that
house
yonder
why
do
they
desire
my
death
oh
you
don
t
know
how
much
your
mother
hates
me
if
you
went
back
to
her
now
and
told
her
that
you
had
left
me
in
my
death
agony
she
would
kiss
you
and
say
god
be
praised
oh
you
don
t
know
in
the
brutality
of
his
tone
in
the
peculiar
expression
of
his
mouth
which
added
bitterness
to
his
words
in
the
vehement
respiration
which
dilated
his
nostrils
in
the
irritated
redness
of
his
eyes
the
real
man
was
exposed
in
spite
of
himself
and
against
this
man
the
son
felt
a
new
impulse
of
his
primitive
aversion
an
impulse
so
sudden
and
so
impetuous
that
without
reflecting
by
a
desire
to
appease
his
father
and
to
be
freed
from
him
he
interrupted
him
saying
in
a
convulsed
voice
no
no
i
know
nothing
tell
me
what
must
i
do
where
must
i
sign
and
he
arose
dismayed
approached
the
window
returned
to
his
father
he
saw
him
seek
something
in
a
drawer
with
a
species
of
nervous
impatience
he
saw
him
lay
on
the
table
a
promissory
note
not
yet
made
out
here
place
your
signature
here
that
will
and
with
his
enormous
index
whose
flat
nail
sank
into
the
folds
of
flesh
he
pointed
to
the
place
for
the
signature
without
sitting
down
without
having
a
clear
consciousness
of
what
he
was
doing
george
took
a
pen
and
signed
rapidly
he
would
have
liked
to
be
already
free
and
away
from
that
room
to
run
in
the
open
air
to
go
far
away
to
be
alone
but
when
he
saw
his
father
take
the
note
examine
the
signature
dry
it
by
sprinkling
it
with
a
pinch
of
sand
then
replace
it
and
lock
the
drawer
when
he
remarked
in
everyone
of
these
acts
the
ignoble
joy
badly
dissimulated
of
a
man
who
had
succeeded
in
an
evil
purpose
when
in
his
soul
he
felt
the
certitude
that
he
had
permitted
himself
to
be
duped
into
a
shameful
fraud
when
he
thought
of
the
interrogations
that
awaited
him
in
the
other
the
useless
regret
for
his
act
upset
him
so
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
giving
play
to
his
extreme
indication
and
to
finally
revolt
with
all
his
power
against
the
scoundrel
in
defence
of
himself
his
family
and
of
the
violated
rights
of
his
mother
and
sister
ah
it
was
true
that
his
mother
had
told
him
was
true
this
man
had
not
a
shadow
of
shame
not
a
trace
of
he
recoiled
from
nothing
and
before
nobody
when
it
was
a
question
of
getting
money
and
he
felt
once
more
the
presence
of
the
concubine
of
the
rapacious
insatiable
woman
who
was
certainly
hidden
in
an
adjoining
room
eavesdropping
spying
waiting
for
her
share
of
the
plunder
without
succeeding
in
repressing
the
tremor
that
shook
him
he
said
you
promise
that
this
money
will
not
be
any
other
purpose
why
yes
of
course
replied
his
father
allowing
his
son
to
see
now
how
much
this
insistance
annoyed
him
and
who
had
manifestly
changed
countenance
since
it
was
no
longer
necessary
for
him
to
beg
and
feign
in
order
to
obtain
take
care
i
shall
know
added
george
who
had
become
very
pale
and
in
a
choking
voice
betraying
an
effort
to
restrain
the
outburst
of
indignation
which
increased
in
proportion
as
the
man
appeared
more
truly
in
his
odious
aspect
in
proportion
as
the
consequences
of
the
precipitate
step
that
he
had
taken
became
more
clearly
defined
take
care
i
do
not
wish
to
become
your
accomplice
against
my
mother
affecting
to
be
hurt
by
this
suspicion
suddenly
raising
his
voice
as
if
to
intimidate
his
son
who
was
undergoing
torture
while
compelling
himself
to
look
him
in
the
face
the
father
roared
what
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
when
will
that
viper
of
a
mother
of
yours
cease
spitting
her
venom
when
will
she
finish
does
she
want
me
to
close
her
mouth
forever
very
well
i
ll
do
it
one
of
these
days
ah
what
a
woman
for
fifteen
years
yes
fifteen
years
she
has
not
given
me
one
minute
s
peace
she
has
poisoned
my
life
she
is
killing
me
by
slow
fire
if
i
am
ruined
it
is
her
fault
do
you
understand
it
is
her
fault
be
silent
cried
george
beside
himself
unrecognizable
pale
as
death
trembling
in
all
his
limbs
seized
by
a
fury
like
that
which
he
had
already
felt
against
diego
be
silent
do
not
speak
her
name
you
are
not
worthy
to
kiss
her
feet
i
came
here
to
speak
to
you
of
her
i
allowed
myself
to
be
played
upon
by
your
comedy
i
permitted
myself
to
be
caught
in
a
trap
what
you
wanted
was
a
present
for
your
ribald
companion
and
you
succeeded
oh
what
shame
and
you
have
the
heart
to
insult
my
mother
his
voice
failed
him
he
choked
a
veil
covered
his
eyes
his
knees
shook
beneath
him
as
if
all
his
strength
was
about
to
abandon
him
now
i
am
going
act
as
you
like
i
am
your
son
no
longer
i
never
want
to
see
you
or
know
anything
of
you
i
will
take
my
mother
away
i
will
take
her
away
with
me
to
some
distant
place
farewell
he
went
out
tottering
a
shadow
before
his
eyes
as
he
passed
through
the
rooms
to
reach
the
terrace
he
heard
the
of
skirts
and
a
door
which
closed
as
if
behind
someone
retiring
in
haste
in
order
not
to
be
surprised
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
open
air
outside
the
railings
he
felt
a
mad
desire
to
weep
to
cry
to
run
across
the
fields
to
knock
his
head
against
a
rock
to
seek
a
precipice
where
all
would
end
his
nerves
trembled
painfully
in
his
head
and
caused
him
cruel
twinges
as
if
they
were
being
broken
one
after
the
other
and
he
thought
with
a
terror
that
the
dying
day
rendered
more
atrocious
where
shall
i
go
shall
i
go
back
this
evening
the
house
seemed
to
him
to
be
moved
back
an
infinite
distance
the
length
of
the
road
appeared
impossible
to
traverse
all
that
was
not
immediate
and
absolute
cessation
of
his
frightful
torture
seemed
to
him
inadmissible
viii
the
following
morning
when
he
opened
his
eyes
after
a
very
restless
night
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
seemed
but
a
confused
memory
the
tragic
deepening
of
the
twilight
on
the
silent
country
the
grave
sound
of
the
angelus
which
prolonged
in
his
ears
by
a
hallucination
of
hearing
had
seemed
endless
the
anguish
which
had
come
over
him
on
approaching
the
house
at
the
sight
of
the
lighted
windows
crossed
at
intervals
by
shadows
the
feverish
excitement
which
had
seized
him
when
pressed
with
questions
by
his
mother
and
sister
he
had
related
the
interview
exaggerating
the
violence
of
the
invectives
and
the
atrocity
of
the
altercation
the
almost
delirious
desire
to
keep
on
speaking
to
add
to
the
recital
of
the
real
facts
the
incoherence
of
his
imagination
the
ejaculations
of
contempt
or
of
tenderness
with
which
his
mother
had
interrupted
him
as
he
went
on
describing
the
brute
s
attitude
and
his
own
energy
in
reproaching
him
then
the
sudden
hoarseness
the
rapid
exasperation
of
the
pain
which
hammered
his
temples
the
spasmodic
efforts
at
a
bitter
and
vomiting
the
severe
cold
which
had
chilled
him
in
bed
the
horrible
dreams
which
had
caused
him
to
start
while
in
the
first
torpor
of
his
enfeebled
this
came
back
confusedly
to
his
memory
augmented
his
painful
physical
stupor
from
which
however
he
would
not
have
been
willing
to
emerge
but
to
enter
into
a
state
of
complete
extinction
into
the
insensibility
of
a
corpse
the
necessity
of
death
was
still
suspended
over
him
with
the
same
imminence
but
it
was
unendurable
for
him
to
think
that
in
order
to
put
his
design
into
execution
he
would
have
to
shake
off
his
inertia
accomplish
a
series
of
fatiguing
acts
conquer
the
physical
repugnance
which
discouraged
him
from
all
effort
where
could
he
kill
himself
how
at
the
house
that
same
day
with
a
firearm
with
poison
his
mind
had
not
yet
conceived
the
precise
and
definite
idea
even
the
torpor
that
paralyzed
him
and
the
bitterness
of
his
mouth
suggested
to
him
the
idea
of
a
narcotic
and
vaguely
without
stopping
to
seek
a
practical
means
by
which
he
could
procure
an
efficacious
dose
he
imagined
its
effect
little
by
little
the
images
multiplied
became
particularized
became
more
distinct
and
their
association
formed
a
visible
scene
what
he
tried
to
imagine
was
not
so
much
the
sensations
of
his
slow
as
the
circumstances
which
would
lead
to
his
mother
sister
and
brother
learning
of
the
catastrophe
he
tried
to
imagine
the
manifestations
of
their
sorrow
their
attitudes
their
words
their
gestures
still
following
the
same
idea
his
curious
attention
extended
to
all
the
survivors
not
only
his
immediate
relatives
but
to
the
entire
family
to
his
friends
to
hippolyte
the
hippolyte
so
distant
that
she
had
almost
become
as
a
stranger
to
him
george
it
was
the
voice
of
his
mother
who
was
knocking
at
the
door
is
it
you
mother
come
in
she
entered
approached
the
bed
with
affectionate
eagerness
leaned
over
him
placed
a
hand
on
his
forehead
and
asked
how
do
you
feel
any
better
a
little
i
m
still
have
a
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
i
should
like
a
drink
camille
is
going
to
bring
you
up
a
cup
of
milk
shall
i
open
the
windows
more
just
as
you
like
mother
his
voice
was
changed
his
mother
s
presence
aroused
in
him
that
sentiment
of
pity
for
himself
which
had
given
birth
to
the
imaginary
picture
of
funereal
regrets
the
time
for
which
he
believed
was
close
at
hand
in
his
mind
the
actuality
of
his
mother
opening
the
windows
became
identified
with
the
imaginary
action
which
would
bring
about
the
terrible
discovery
and
his
eyes
grew
moist
with
commiseration
for
himself
and
for
the
poor
woman
whom
he
destined
to
receive
such
a
cruel
blow
and
the
tragic
scene
appeared
before
him
with
all
the
distinctness
of
a
thing
actually
seen
his
mother
a
little
frightened
turns
round
in
the
light
calls
him
again
by
name
trembling
she
approaches
the
bed
touches
him
shakes
him
finds
his
body
inert
cold
rigid
and
then
she
falls
fainting
prostrate
over
his
corpse
perhaps
dead
such
a
shock
might
kill
her
and
his
anxiety
increased
and
the
moment
seemed
solemn
to
him
like
all
that
is
final
and
his
mother
s
appearance
actions
and
words
assumed
in
his
eyes
such
an
unusual
signification
and
value
that
he
followed
them
with
almost
anxious
attention
drawn
suddenly
from
his
spiritual
torpor
he
had
just
recovered
an
extraordinarily
active
consciousness
of
life
there
reappeared
in
him
a
phenomenon
the
singularity
of
which
had
often
attracted
his
attention
it
was
an
instantaneous
passage
from
one
state
of
consciousness
to
another
between
the
new
state
and
the
anterior
state
there
was
the
same
difference
as
exists
between
waking
and
slumber
and
that
recalled
to
his
mind
the
sudden
change
produced
in
the
theatre
when
the
footlights
are
unexpectedly
turned
up
and
project
their
strongest
light
so
as
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
the
son
gazed
on
his
mother
with
eyes
that
were
no
longer
the
same
and
saw
her
as
he
had
seen
her
then
with
strange
lucidity
he
felt
that
this
woman
s
life
was
brought
closer
to
became
connected
with
as
if
adherent
to
his
own
life
he
felt
the
mysterious
relation
of
the
blood
and
the
affliction
of
the
fate
which
menaced
them
both
and
when
his
mother
came
close
to
him
again
and
sat
down
by
his
bedside
he
raised
himself
a
little
on
his
pillow
took
one
of
her
hands
tried
to
dissimulate
his
agitation
by
a
smile
under
the
pretext
of
looking
at
the
cameo
of
a
ring
he
examined
the
long
and
thin
hand
to
which
each
particularity
imparted
an
extraordinary
expression
of
life
and
whose
contact
caused
him
a
sensation
resembling
no
other
his
soul
still
enveloped
in
the
gloomy
images
recently
evoked
he
thought
when
i
am
dead
when
she
touches
me
when
she
feels
the
and
he
shuddered
as
he
remembered
his
own
aversion
to
touching
a
corpse
what
s
the
matter
asked
his
mother
little
nervous
that
s
all
oh
you
are
not
well
she
went
on
shaking
her
head
where
do
you
feel
ill
nowhere
mother
i
am
naturally
a
little
upset
but
the
unnatural
and
convulsive
look
in
her
son
s
face
did
not
escape
the
maternal
eye
how
sorry
i
am
that
i
sent
you
there
how
wrong
it
was
of
me
to
send
you
no
mother
why
it
was
necessary
sooner
or
later
and
all
at
once
without
the
slightest
confusion
henceforth
he
relived
the
frightful
hour
he
saw
once
more
his
father
s
gestures
heard
once
more
his
voice
he
heard
again
his
own
voice
that
voice
so
changed
which
contrary
to
all
expectation
had
uttered
such
grave
words
it
seemed
to
him
he
was
a
stranger
to
that
action
and
these
uttered
words
and
nevertheless
at
the
bottom
of
his
soul
he
felt
a
sort
of
obscure
remorse
he
felt
something
akin
to
an
instinctive
consciousness
of
having
passed
beyond
bounds
of
having
committed
an
irreparable
transgression
of
having
trampled
under
foot
something
human
and
sacred
why
had
he
departed
with
such
violence
from
the
great
calm
resignation
with
which
the
funereal
image
of
demetrius
had
inspired
him
when
it
had
appeared
to
him
in
the
midst
of
the
silent
country
why
had
he
not
persisted
in
considering
with
the
same
painful
and
clairvoyant
pity
the
baseness
and
ignominy
of
that
man
upon
whom
as
upon
all
other
men
weighed
an
invincible
destiny
and
he
himself
he
who
carried
that
blood
in
his
veins
did
he
not
also
bear
perhaps
at
the
bottom
of
his
substance
all
the
latent
germs
of
those
abominable
vices
if
he
continued
to
live
did
not
he
too
risk
falling
into
a
similar
abjection
and
then
all
the
cholers
all
the
hates
all
the
violences
all
the
punishments
appeared
to
him
to
be
unjust
and
useless
life
was
a
heavy
fermentation
of
impure
matters
he
believed
he
felt
that
in
his
substance
he
had
a
thousand
forces
occult
unrecognizable
and
indestructible
whose
progressive
and
fatal
evolution
had
made
up
his
existence
up
to
then
and
would
make
up
his
future
existence
if
it
had
not
happened
precisely
that
his
will
had
to
obey
one
of
these
forces
that
now
imposed
on
him
the
supreme
action
in
short
why
regret
what
i
did
yesterday
could
i
have
prevented
myself
from
doing
it
it
was
he
repeated
with
a
new
signification
as
if
speaking
to
himself
and
he
sat
a
spectator
lucid
and
attentive
at
the
unrolling
of
the
little
of
the
life
that
remained
for
him
to
live
ix
when
his
mother
and
sister
had
left
him
alone
he
stayed
in
bed
a
few
moments
longer
through
a
physical
repugnance
to
do
anything
whatever
it
seemed
to
him
that
to
rise
he
would
have
to
make
an
enormous
effort
it
seemed
to
him
too
fatiguing
to
leave
that
horizontal
position
in
which
in
one
hour
perhaps
he
was
going
to
find
eternal
repose
and
once
more
he
thought
of
a
narcotic
close
the
eyes
and
wait
for
sleep
the
virginal
light
of
that
may
morning
the
azure
reflected
in
the
the
beam
of
sunlight
that
streamed
on
the
floor
the
voices
and
murmurs
that
arose
from
the
street
all
those
living
signs
that
seemed
to
rise
above
the
balcony
and
reach
as
far
as
him
and
reconquer
him
all
inspired
him
with
a
kind
of
fright
mixed
with
rancor
and
he
saw
again
in
his
mind
the
image
of
his
mother
going
through
the
gesture
of
opening
the
window
he
saw
camille
once
more
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
reheard
the
words
of
both
always
relating
to
the
same
man
what
he
most
clearly
remembered
was
a
cruel
exclamation
uttered
by
his
mother
with
lips
overflowing
with
bitterness
and
with
it
he
associated
the
vision
of
the
paternal
features
those
features
on
which
he
believed
he
had
discovered
over
there
on
the
terrace
in
the
strong
light
reflected
by
the
whiteness
of
the
wall
the
symptoms
of
a
mortal
malady
in
front
of
camille
and
himself
his
mother
had
said
passionately
if
that
were
only
true
heaven
grant
it
is
true
so
that
then
was
the
last
impression
left
in
his
heart
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
the
world
by
the
creature
who
was
formerly
in
his
house
the
source
of
every
tenderness
an
energetic
impulse
suddenly
came
over
him
he
threw
himself
from
his
bed
definitely
resolved
to
act
it
will
be
done
before
evening
where
shall
i
do
it
he
thought
of
demetrius
s
closed
rooms
he
had
not
yet
a
definite
plan
but
he
felt
morally
certain
that
during
the
hours
that
still
remained
to
run
the
means
would
be
spontaneously
offered
by
a
sudden
suggestion
which
he
would
be
forced
to
obey
while
he
proceeded
to
make
his
toilet
the
preoccupation
haunted
him
to
prepare
his
body
for
the
tomb
he
too
had
that
species
of
funereal
vanity
that
has
been
remarked
in
certain
criminals
condemned
to
death
and
in
suicides
he
rendered
this
sentiment
more
intense
on
observing
it
in
himself
and
a
regret
came
over
him
at
having
to
die
in
this
little
obscure
town
at
the
bottom
of
that
wild
province
far
from
his
friends
who
for
a
long
time
perhaps
would
be
ignorant
of
his
death
if
on
the
contrary
the
act
were
done
in
rome
in
the
great
city
where
he
was
well
known
his
friends
would
have
grieved
for
him
they
would
doubtless
have
given
to
the
tragic
mystery
the
adornment
of
poetry
and
once
more
he
tried
to
picture
what
would
follow
his
attitude
on
the
bed
in
the
chamber
of
his
amours
the
profound
emotion
of
the
youthful
souls
the
fraternal
souls
at
the
sight
of
the
corpse
reposing
in
austere
peace
the
dialogues
at
the
funereal
vigil
by
the
light
of
the
candles
the
coffin
covered
with
wreaths
followed
by
a
crowd
of
young
and
silent
men
the
words
of
farewell
pronounced
by
a
poet
stefano
gondi
he
died
he
could
not
make
his
life
correspond
to
his
and
then
hippolyte
s
sorrow
despair
and
loss
of
reason
hippolyte
where
was
she
what
were
her
thoughts
what
was
she
doing
no
he
thought
my
presentiment
does
not
deceive
me
and
he
saw
again
in
imagination
his
mistress
s
gesture
as
she
lowered
her
black
veil
after
the
last
kiss
and
he
went
over
in
his
mind
the
little
points
yet
there
was
one
thing
he
could
not
explain
and
that
was
the
almost
absolute
acquiescence
of
his
soul
at
the
necessary
and
definite
renunciation
which
dispossessed
him
of
this
woman
only
lately
the
object
of
so
many
dreams
and
of
so
much
adoration
why
after
the
fever
and
anguish
of
the
first
days
had
hope
abandoned
him
little
by
little
why
had
he
fallen
into
the
melancholy
certainty
that
all
effort
would
be
useless
to
resuscitate
that
dead
and
incredibly
distant
thing
why
had
all
that
past
been
so
entirely
separated
from
him
that
during
these
last
days
beneath
the
shock
of
recent
tortures
he
had
barely
felt
a
few
vibrations
reverberate
clearly
in
his
conscience
hippolyte
where
was
she
what
were
her
feelings
what
was
she
doing
on
what
sights
were
her
eyes
resting
from
what
words
from
what
contacts
did
she
suffer
uneasiness
what
could
have
happened
that
for
two
weeks
she
had
not
found
the
means
to
send
him
news
less
vague
and
brief
than
four
or
five
telegrams
sent
from
always
different
places
perhaps
she
is
already
giving
way
to
desire
for
another
man
that
of
whom
she
was
continually
and
the
frightful
thought
aroused
by
the
old
habit
of
suspicion
and
accusation
suddenly
mastered
him
overwhelmed
him
as
in
the
gloomiest
hours
of
his
past
life
a
tumult
of
bitter
recollections
arose
in
him
leaning
on
the
same
balcony
where
the
first
evening
amidst
the
perfume
of
the
bergamots
in
the
anguish
of
first
regrets
he
had
invoked
the
name
of
the
loved
one
he
relived
in
one
second
the
miseries
of
two
years
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
splendor
of
this
may
morning
it
was
the
recent
happiness
of
the
unknown
rival
that
blossomed
and
was
diffused
as
far
as
where
he
stood
x
as
if
to
initiate
himself
in
the
profound
mystery
into
which
he
was
about
to
enter
george
desired
to
see
once
more
the
deserted
apartment
where
demetrius
had
passed
the
last
days
of
his
life
in
willing
all
his
fortune
to
his
nephew
demetrius
had
also
willed
him
this
apartment
george
had
kept
the
rooms
intact
with
pious
care
as
one
guards
a
reliquary
the
rooms
were
situated
on
the
upper
floor
and
looked
south
over
the
garden
he
took
the
key
and
went
upstairs
treading
cautiously
to
avoid
being
questioned
but
as
he
traversed
the
corridor
he
was
necessarily
obliged
to
pass
by
his
aunt
joconda
s
door
hoping
to
pass
unnoticed
he
walked
softly
on
holding
his
breath
he
heard
the
old
woman
cough
he
made
a
few
quicker
strides
believing
that
the
noise
of
the
cough
would
cover
the
sounds
of
his
footsteps
who
s
there
demanded
a
hoarse
voice
from
within
it
is
i
aunt
joconda
ah
it
s
you
george
come
in
come
she
appeared
upon
the
threshold
with
her
ugly
yellowish
face
which
in
the
shadow
was
almost
cadaveric
and
she
glanced
at
her
nephew
s
hands
before
looking
at
his
face
as
if
to
see
first
if
his
hands
had
brought
something
i
am
going
in
the
next
apartment
said
george
repelled
by
the
ignoble
bodily
odor
which
filled
him
with
disgust
i
must
air
the
rooms
a
little
and
he
resumed
his
steps
in
the
corridor
until
he
came
to
the
other
door
but
as
he
turned
the
key
he
heard
behind
him
the
limping
of
the
old
woman
george
felt
his
heart
sink
as
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
would
not
find
a
way
to
disembarrass
himself
of
her
that
perhaps
he
would
be
obliged
to
listen
to
her
stammering
voice
amid
the
almost
religious
silence
of
these
rooms
with
their
beloved
yet
terrible
souvenirs
without
saying
anything
without
turning
round
he
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
first
room
was
dark
the
air
somewhat
warm
and
suffocating
impregnated
with
that
singular
odor
peculiar
to
old
libraries
a
streak
of
faint
light
showed
where
the
window
was
before
opening
the
shutters
george
hesitated
he
strained
his
ear
to
hear
the
gnawing
of
the
aunt
joconda
began
to
cough
invisible
in
the
darkness
then
feeling
on
the
window
to
find
the
iron
catch
he
felt
a
slight
thrill
a
fugitive
fear
he
opened
it
and
turned
round
he
saw
the
vague
shapes
of
the
furniture
in
the
greenish
penumbra
produced
by
the
shutters
he
saw
the
old
woman
in
the
middle
of
the
room
one
side
distorted
swaying
her
flaccid
body
to
and
fro
chewing
something
he
pushed
back
the
shutters
which
creaked
on
their
hinges
a
flood
of
sunlight
inundated
the
interior
the
discolored
curtains
fluttered
at
first
he
was
undecided
the
presence
of
the
old
woman
prevented
him
from
abandoning
himself
to
his
feelings
his
irritation
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
he
did
not
speak
a
single
word
to
her
fearing
that
his
voice
would
only
be
cross
and
angry
he
passed
into
the
adjoining
room
and
opened
the
window
the
light
spread
everywhere
and
the
curtains
fluttered
he
passed
into
the
third
room
and
opened
the
window
the
light
spread
everywhere
and
the
curtains
fluttered
he
went
no
farther
the
next
room
in
the
angle
was
the
bedroom
he
wished
to
enter
it
alone
he
heard
with
nausea
the
limping
gait
of
the
unfortunate
old
woman
rejoining
him
he
took
a
chair
and
relapsed
into
an
obstinate
silence
waiting
the
old
woman
crossed
the
threshold
slowly
seeing
george
seated
and
not
speaking
she
was
perplexed
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
the
fresh
air
that
blew
in
from
the
window
unquestionably
irritated
her
catarrh
and
she
began
to
cough
again
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
at
every
spell
her
body
seemed
to
swell
and
then
to
subside
like
the
bag
of
a
bagpipe
beneath
an
intermittent
breath
she
held
her
hands
on
her
hands
like
tallow
with
nails
bordered
with
black
and
in
her
mouth
between
the
toothless
gums
her
whitish
tongue
quivered
as
soon
as
her
fit
of
coughing
was
over
she
drew
from
her
pocket
a
dirty
paper
bag
and
took
out
a
pastille
still
standing
she
chewed
staring
at
george
in
a
stupid
manner
her
gaze
wandered
from
george
towards
the
closed
door
of
the
fourth
room
and
the
old
woman
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
then
went
and
sat
down
on
the
seat
nearest
to
george
her
hands
on
her
abdomen
and
the
eyelids
lowered
she
recited
a
she
is
praying
for
her
brother
thought
george
for
the
soul
of
the
it
seemed
inconceivable
to
him
that
this
woman
should
be
the
sister
of
demetrius
aurispa
how
could
the
proud
and
generous
blood
which
had
soaked
the
bed
in
the
adjoining
room
the
blood
sprung
from
a
brain
already
corroded
by
the
highest
cares
of
the
intelligence
have
come
from
the
same
source
as
that
which
coursed
so
impoverished
in
the
veins
of
this
peevish
and
disgusting
old
woman
with
her
it
is
greediness
which
regrets
the
liberality
of
the
donor
how
strange
this
prayer
of
gratitude
from
an
old
dilapidated
stomach
towards
the
most
noble
of
suicides
how
odd
life
is
all
at
once
aunt
joconda
began
to
cough
again
you
had
better
go
from
here
aunt
it
isn
t
good
for
you
said
george
who
no
longer
had
the
strength
to
master
his
impatience
the
air
here
is
bad
for
your
cough
you
had
better
go
really
come
i
will
see
you
back
to
your
room
aunt
joconda
looked
at
him
surprised
at
his
abrupt
speech
and
unusual
tone
she
rose
and
went
limping
through
the
rooms
when
she
reached
the
corridor
she
again
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
as
if
muttering
an
exorcism
when
she
had
gone
george
closed
the
door
and
gave
the
key
a
double
turn
at
last
he
was
alone
and
free
with
an
invisible
companion
he
remained
motionless
for
a
few
moments
as
if
under
magnetic
influence
and
he
felt
his
whole
being
invaded
by
the
supernatural
fascination
which
that
man
existing
without
life
exercised
over
him
from
the
bottom
of
the
tomb
and
he
reappeared
to
his
mind
a
mild
meditative
man
with
a
face
full
of
a
virile
melancholy
and
with
a
single
white
curl
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
among
the
black
hair
giving
him
an
odd
appearance
for
me
thought
george
he
exists
since
the
day
of
his
corporeal
death
i
have
felt
his
presence
every
minute
never
so
much
as
since
his
death
have
i
felt
our
consanguinity
never
so
much
as
since
his
death
have
i
had
the
perception
of
the
intensity
of
his
being
all
that
he
consumed
in
contact
with
his
every
action
every
gesture
every
word
that
he
has
sown
in
the
course
of
time
every
diverse
manifestation
which
determined
the
special
character
of
his
being
in
relation
with
other
beings
every
characteristic
fixed
or
variable
which
distinguished
his
personality
from
other
personalities
and
made
of
him
a
man
apart
in
the
human
multitude
in
short
all
that
which
differentiated
his
own
life
from
other
now
seems
to
me
to
be
collected
concentrated
circumscribed
in
the
unique
and
ideal
tie
that
binds
him
to
me
he
does
not
exist
for
anyone
but
me
alone
he
is
freed
from
all
other
contact
he
is
in
communication
with
me
alone
he
exists
purer
and
more
intense
than
ever
he
took
a
few
steps
slowly
the
heavy
silence
was
disturbed
at
moments
by
little
mysterious
noises
scarcely
perceptible
the
fresh
air
the
warmth
of
the
day
contracted
the
fibres
of
the
benumbed
furniture
accustomed
to
the
obscurity
of
the
closed
windows
the
breath
of
heaven
penetrated
the
pores
of
the
wood
shook
the
particles
of
dust
swelled
the
folds
of
the
hangings
in
a
ray
of
sunlight
myriads
of
atoms
whirled
about
the
odor
of
the
books
was
overcome
gradually
by
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
the
things
suggested
to
the
survivor
a
crowd
of
recollections
from
these
things
arose
a
light
and
murmuring
chorus
which
enveloped
him
from
every
side
arose
the
emanations
of
the
past
one
would
have
said
that
the
things
emitted
the
odors
of
a
spiritual
substance
which
had
impregnated
them
do
i
exalt
myself
he
asked
himself
at
the
aspect
of
the
images
that
succeeded
one
another
in
his
mind
with
prodigious
rapidity
clear
as
visions
not
obscured
by
a
funereal
shadow
but
living
a
superior
life
and
he
remained
perplexed
fascinated
by
the
mystery
seized
by
a
terrible
anguish
at
the
moment
of
venturing
on
the
confines
of
that
unknown
world
the
curtains
which
a
rhythmic
breath
seemed
to
swell
undulated
softly
giving
glimpses
of
a
noble
and
calm
landscape
the
slight
noises
made
by
the
wainscoting
the
papers
and
the
partitions
continued
in
the
third
room
severe
and
simple
the
recollections
were
musical
and
came
from
mute
instruments
on
a
long
piano
whose
varnished
surface
reflected
things
like
a
mirror
a
violin
reposed
in
its
box
on
a
chair
a
page
of
music
rose
and
fell
at
the
pleasure
of
the
breeze
and
almost
in
time
with
the
curtains
george
picked
it
up
it
was
a
page
from
a
mendelssohn
motet
domenica
ii
post
pascha
quasi
allegretto
surrexit
pastor
farther
on
on
a
table
there
was
a
heap
of
parts
for
the
violin
and
piano
leipzig
editions
beethoven
bach
schubert
rode
tartini
viotti
george
opened
the
case
examined
the
fragile
instrument
that
slept
on
velvet
with
its
four
strings
still
intact
a
curiosity
seized
him
to
awaken
them
he
touched
the
treble
string
which
gave
a
plaintive
moan
that
vibrated
through
the
entire
body
it
was
a
violin
made
by
andrea
guarneri
dated
demetrius
reappeared
tall
and
slender
a
little
bent
his
neck
long
and
pale
his
hair
brushed
back
and
with
the
single
white
lock
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
he
held
the
violin
he
passed
one
hand
through
his
hair
on
the
temple
near
the
ear
with
his
usual
gesture
he
tuned
the
instrument
rosined
the
bow
then
attacked
the
sonata
his
left
hand
shrivelled
and
proud
ran
up
and
down
the
neck
the
tips
of
his
thin
fingers
pressed
the
strings
and
beneath
the
skin
the
play
of
his
muscles
was
so
visible
as
to
be
painful
his
right
hand
when
drawing
the
bow
moved
with
a
long
faultless
motion
sometimes
he
held
the
instrument
tighter
with
his
chin
his
head
inclined
his
eyes
enjoying
keenly
his
inner
voluptuousness
sometimes
he
drew
himself
erect
looked
fixedly
before
him
his
eyes
strangely
brilliant
smiled
a
fugitive
smile
and
from
his
brow
beamed
an
extraordinary
purity
thus
the
violinist
reappeared
to
the
survivor
and
george
lived
again
the
hours
of
life
already
lived
he
lived
them
again
not
in
pictures
only
but
in
actual
and
profound
sensations
he
lived
again
the
long
hours
of
close
intimacy
and
forgetfulness
the
time
when
demetrius
and
himself
alone
in
the
warm
room
to
which
no
noise
could
penetrate
executed
the
music
of
their
favorite
masters
how
they
used
to
forget
their
very
existence
in
what
strange
raptures
this
music
executed
by
their
own
hands
soon
threw
them
often
the
fascination
of
a
single
melody
held
them
prisoners
an
entire
afternoon
without
their
being
able
to
leave
the
magic
circle
in
which
they
were
enclosed
how
often
they
had
rehearsed
that
without
of
mendelssohn
which
had
revealed
to
them
both
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
a
sort
of
inconsolable
hopelessness
how
often
they
had
rehearsed
a
beethoven
sonata
which
seemed
to
grasp
their
souls
to
carry
them
away
with
a
vertiginous
rapidity
across
the
infinity
of
space
and
hover
with
them
during
the
flight
over
every
abyss
the
survivor
went
back
in
his
recollections
as
far
as
the
autumn
of
to
that
unforgetful
autumn
of
melancholy
and
poetry
when
demetrius
had
scarcely
emerged
from
convalescence
that
was
to
be
the
last
autumn
after
a
long
period
of
enforced
silence
demetrius
took
up
his
violin
again
with
strange
disquietude
as
if
he
feared
having
lost
all
his
aptitude
and
all
his
mastery
all
his
knowledge
of
the
instrument
oh
what
trembling
of
the
enfeebled
fingers
on
the
strings
and
the
incertitude
of
the
bowing
when
he
essayed
the
first
tones
and
those
two
tears
that
formed
slowly
in
the
cavity
of
his
eyes
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
were
arrested
in
the
threads
of
his
beard
rather
long
and
still
untrimmed
the
survivor
again
saw
the
violinist
about
to
improvise
while
he
himself
accompanied
him
on
the
piano
with
an
almost
insupportable
anguish
attentive
in
following
him
in
anticipating
him
always
fearing
to
break
the
measure
strike
a
false
note
make
a
discord
or
miss
a
note
in
his
improvisations
demetrius
aurispa
was
almost
always
inspired
with
poetry
george
remembered
the
marvellous
improvisation
that
on
a
certain
october
day
the
violinist
had
composed
on
a
lyric
poem
by
alfred
tennyson
in
george
himself
had
translated
the
verse
so
that
demetrius
could
understand
it
and
he
had
proposed
it
to
him
as
a
theme
where
was
that
page
the
curiosity
of
a
sad
sensation
prompted
george
to
search
for
it
in
an
album
placed
among
the
pieces
of
music
he
was
sure
he
could
find
it
he
remembered
it
very
clearly
and
in
fact
he
found
it
it
was
a
single
sheet
written
in
violet
ink
the
characters
had
paled
and
the
sheet
had
become
rumpled
yellowish
without
consistency
soft
as
a
spider
s
web
it
bore
the
sadness
of
pages
traced
a
long
time
ago
by
a
dear
hand
gone
henceforth
forever
george
who
scarcely
recognized
the
characters
said
to
himself
it
is
i
who
wrote
this
page
this
writing
is
mine
it
was
a
rather
timid
hand
unequal
almost
feminine
recalling
a
schoolboy
s
writing
preserving
the
ambiguity
of
the
recent
adolescence
the
hesitating
delicacy
of
a
soul
that
dares
not
yet
know
all
what
a
change
in
that
too
and
he
read
again
the
poet
s
verse
tears
idle
tears
i
know
not
what
they
mean
tears
from
the
depth
of
some
divine
despair
rise
in
the
heart
and
gather
to
the
eyes
in
looking
on
the
happy
and
thinking
of
the
days
that
are
no
more
fresh
as
the
first
beam
glittering
on
a
sail
that
brings
our
friends
up
from
the
underworld
sad
as
the
last
which
reddens
over
one
that
sinks
with
all
we
love
below
the
verge
so
sad
so
fresh
the
days
that
are
no
more
ah
sad
and
strange
as
in
dark
summer
dawns
the
earliest
pipe
of
d
birds
to
dying
ears
when
unto
dying
eyes
the
casement
slowly
grows
a
glimmering
square
so
sad
so
strange
the
days
that
are
no
more
dear
as
remember
d
kisses
after
death
and
sweet
as
those
by
hopeless
fancy
feign
d
on
lips
that
are
for
others
deep
as
love
deep
as
first
love
and
wild
with
all
regret
o
death
in
life
the
days
that
are
no
more
demetrius
improvised
standing
beside
the
piano
a
trifle
paler
a
trifle
more
bent
but
from
time
to
time
he
drew
himself
erect
beneath
the
breath
of
inspiration
as
a
bent
reed
straightens
beneath
the
breath
of
the
wind
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
in
the
direction
of
the
window
where
as
if
in
a
frame
appeared
an
autumn
landscape
reddish
and
misty
according
to
the
vicissitudes
of
the
heavens
without
a
changeable
light
flooded
at
intervals
his
person
flashed
in
the
humidity
of
his
eyes
gilded
his
extraordinarily
pure
brow
and
the
violin
said
sad
as
the
last
which
reddens
over
one
that
sinks
with
all
we
love
below
the
verge
so
sad
so
fresh
the
days
that
are
no
more
and
the
violin
repeated
with
sobs
o
death
in
life
the
days
that
are
no
more
at
the
reminiscence
at
the
vision
conjured
up
a
supreme
anguish
assailed
the
survivor
when
the
images
had
passed
the
silence
seemed
to
him
still
heavier
the
delicate
instrument
through
which
demetrius
s
soul
had
sung
its
loftiest
songs
had
again
sunk
to
sleep
with
its
four
strings
still
intact
in
the
case
george
lowered
the
lid
as
on
a
corpse
around
him
the
silence
was
lugubrious
but
he
still
retained
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
like
a
refrain
indefinitely
prolonged
this
sigh
o
death
in
life
the
days
that
are
no
more
he
remained
a
few
moments
before
the
door
which
shut
off
the
tragic
chamber
he
felt
that
henceforth
he
was
no
longer
master
of
himself
his
nerves
dominated
him
imposed
on
him
the
disorder
and
excess
of
their
sensations
he
felt
about
his
head
a
band
that
contracted
and
enlarged
according
to
the
palpitations
of
his
arteries
as
if
it
were
an
elastic
and
cold
substance
the
same
cold
chill
ran
down
his
spinal
column
with
sudden
energy
in
a
sort
of
rage
he
turned
the
knob
and
entered
without
looking
about
him
walking
in
the
ray
of
light
which
projected
through
the
open
door
was
shed
across
the
floor
he
went
straight
towards
one
of
the
balconies
opened
the
two
shutters
he
also
opened
the
shutters
of
the
other
balcony
after
this
rapid
action
accomplished
under
the
impulse
of
a
sort
of
horror
turned
agitated
gasping
he
felt
his
flesh
creep
what
he
saw
before
anything
else
was
the
bed
stationed
in
front
of
him
with
its
green
counterpane
all
of
walnut
but
simple
in
form
without
carving
without
ornaments
without
curtains
for
several
moments
he
saw
nothing
but
the
bed
like
on
that
terrible
day
when
crossing
the
threshold
of
the
room
he
had
stopped
petrified
at
the
sight
of
the
corpse
evoked
by
the
survivor
s
imagination
the
corpse
with
its
head
enveloped
in
a
black
veil
and
its
arms
stretched
alongside
the
body
retook
its
place
on
the
mortuary
couch
the
strong
light
which
entered
from
the
balconies
did
not
succeed
in
dissipating
the
phantom
it
was
a
vision
not
continuous
but
intermittent
seen
now
and
then
as
if
by
a
rapid
closure
of
the
eyelids
although
the
witness
s
eyelids
remained
immovable
in
the
silence
of
the
room
and
in
the
silence
of
his
soul
george
heard
very
distinctly
the
scratching
of
the
and
this
trifling
fact
sufficed
to
dissipate
momentarily
in
him
the
extreme
violence
of
the
nervous
tension
as
the
prick
of
a
needle
suffices
to
empty
a
swollen
blister
every
particular
of
the
terrible
day
came
back
to
his
memory
the
unexpected
news
brought
to
torricelle
di
sarsa
at
about
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
by
a
breathless
messenger
who
stammered
and
wept
the
exhausting
journey
on
horseback
in
the
heat
of
the
across
the
scorched
hills
and
during
the
journey
the
sudden
fainting
spells
which
made
him
reel
in
his
saddle
then
the
house
filled
with
sobs
filled
with
noises
of
doors
banged
by
the
gale
filled
with
the
buzzing
he
had
in
the
arteries
and
finally
the
impetuous
entry
into
the
room
the
sight
of
the
corpse
the
curtains
swelling
and
swishing
the
tinkling
of
the
basin
suspended
on
the
wall
the
deed
had
been
done
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
of
august
without
any
suspicious
preparations
the
suicide
had
left
no
letter
not
even
for
his
nephew
the
will
by
which
he
constituted
george
his
sole
legatee
was
already
of
old
date
demetrius
had
taken
evident
precautions
to
conceal
the
causes
of
his
resolution
and
even
to
avoid
every
pretext
for
hypotheses
he
had
taken
care
to
destroy
even
the
least
traces
of
the
acts
which
had
preceded
the
supreme
act
in
the
apartment
everything
was
found
in
order
in
an
order
almost
excessive
not
a
paper
remained
on
the
desk
not
a
book
was
missing
from
the
shelves
of
the
bookcase
on
the
little
table
near
the
bed
was
the
open
nothing
more
for
the
thousandth
time
a
question
arose
in
the
mind
of
the
survivor
why
did
he
kill
himself
had
he
a
secret
which
gnawed
at
his
heart
or
else
was
it
the
cruel
sagacity
of
his
intelligence
which
rendered
life
insupportable
he
bore
his
destiny
within
himself
as
i
bear
mine
in
myself
he
looked
at
the
little
silver
emblem
still
suspended
on
the
wall
at
the
head
of
the
bed
a
symbol
of
religion
a
maternal
pious
souvenir
it
was
a
fine
piece
of
workmanship
by
an
old
master
goldsmith
of
guardiagrele
andrea
sort
of
hereditary
jewel
he
loved
religious
emblems
sacred
music
the
odor
of
incense
crucifixes
the
hymns
of
the
latin
church
he
was
a
mystic
an
ascetic
the
most
passionate
contemplator
of
the
inner
life
but
he
did
not
believe
in
god
he
looked
at
the
and
a
thought
latent
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
his
brain
was
revealed
to
him
as
by
a
lightning
flash
i
too
will
kill
myself
with
one
of
these
the
same
on
the
same
after
a
short
appeasement
his
exaltation
took
hold
of
him
again
again
he
felt
his
flesh
creep
once
more
he
felt
the
actual
and
profound
sensation
of
the
shudder
already
experienced
on
the
tragic
day
when
he
had
wished
to
raise
with
his
own
hands
the
black
veil
spread
over
the
dead
man
s
face
and
when
through
the
linen
wrappings
he
believed
he
could
see
the
ravages
of
the
wound
the
horrible
ravage
made
by
the
explosion
of
the
firearm
by
the
impact
of
the
ball
against
the
bone
of
the
skull
against
that
brow
so
delicate
and
so
pure
in
reality
he
had
seen
only
a
portion
of
the
nose
the
mouth
and
the
chin
the
rest
was
hidden
by
the
bandages
several
times
folded
perhaps
because
the
eyes
had
started
from
their
sockets
but
the
mouth
intact
permitted
a
view
of
the
beard
silky
and
mouth
pale
and
withered
which
living
opened
so
softly
for
the
unexpected
mouth
had
received
from
the
seal
of
death
an
expression
of
superhuman
calmness
rendered
more
extraordinary
by
the
bloody
havoc
hidden
by
the
bandages
this
image
fixed
in
an
ineffaceable
imprint
was
graven
in
the
soul
of
the
inheritor
in
the
centre
of
his
soul
and
after
five
years
it
still
preserved
the
same
evidence
preserved
by
a
fatal
power
in
thinking
that
he
also
would
stretch
himself
on
the
same
bed
and
that
he
would
kill
himself
with
the
same
weapon
george
did
not
feel
that
tumultuous
and
vibrant
emotion
which
sudden
resolutions
impart
it
was
rather
an
indefinable
feeling
as
if
it
concerned
a
project
formed
a
long
time
ago
and
approved
in
a
rather
indefinite
fashion
and
that
the
time
had
come
to
decide
about
it
and
to
accomplish
it
he
opened
the
case
examined
the
pistols
they
were
fine
weapons
rifled
duelling
pistols
of
old
english
make
with
a
stock
perfectly
fitted
to
the
hand
they
reposed
on
a
velvet
a
little
frayed
at
the
edges
of
the
compartments
which
contained
everything
necessary
for
loading
them
as
the
barrels
were
of
large
calibre
the
balls
were
large
those
which
when
they
touch
their
object
always
produce
a
decisive
effect
george
took
one
and
weighed
it
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
could
be
dead
demetrius
has
left
on
this
bed
the
hollow
where
i
shall
lie
and
by
an
imaginary
transposition
it
was
himself
whom
he
saw
stretched
on
the
couch
but
that
that
he
had
a
perception
of
being
gnawed
by
the
insects
as
distinctly
and
as
frightfully
as
if
the
animals
were
in
his
brain
this
implacable
gnawing
came
from
the
bed
and
he
perceived
it
then
he
understood
the
sadness
of
the
man
who
before
dying
hears
beneath
him
the
gnawing
of
the
when
he
pictured
himself
in
the
act
of
pressing
the
trigger
he
felt
an
agonized
and
repulsive
contraction
of
all
his
nerves
when
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
forced
him
to
kill
himself
and
that
he
could
wait
he
felt
at
the
deepest
recesses
of
his
substance
the
spontaneous
expansion
of
intense
relief
a
thousand
invisible
ties
still
bound
him
to
life
hippolyte
he
went
towards
the
balcony
towards
the
light
with
a
sort
of
impetuosity
a
background
of
an
immense
landscape
bluish
and
mysterious
melted
in
the
languor
of
the
day
the
sun
was
slowly
setting
on
the
mountain
which
it
flooded
with
gold
like
the
couch
of
a
mistress
who
awaited
the
majella
enormous
and
white
all
bathed
in
this
liquid
gold
reared
its
huge
mass
in
the
sky
hermitage
i
in
her
letter
of
may
hippolyte
had
said
i
can
at
last
dispose
of
a
free
hour
to
write
you
a
long
letter
my
has
now
been
dragging
his
pain
from
hotel
to
hotel
around
the
lake
for
the
last
ten
days
and
we
both
follow
him
like
troubled
souls
you
could
never
imagine
the
melancholy
of
this
pilgrimage
i
myself
am
utterly
exhausted
i
await
the
first
favorable
opportunity
to
leave
them
have
you
already
found
the
hermitage
she
had
said
your
letters
increase
my
torment
inexpressibly
i
know
well
your
malady
and
i
divine
that
words
fail
you
to
express
your
suffering
i
would
give
half
of
my
blood
to
succeed
in
convincing
you
once
for
all
that
i
am
yours
absolutely
yours
forever
until
death
i
think
of
you
of
you
only
uninterruptedly
every
instant
of
my
life
away
from
you
i
can
not
enjoy
one
moment
s
calm
and
happiness
everything
disgusts
and
irritates
me
oh
when
will
it
be
given
me
to
be
with
you
entire
days
to
live
your
life
you
will
see
i
shall
no
longer
be
the
same
woman
i
shall
be
amiable
tender
gentle
i
shall
take
care
to
be
always
the
same
always
discreet
i
shall
tell
you
all
my
thoughts
and
you
will
tell
me
all
yours
i
shall
be
your
mistress
your
friend
your
sister
and
if
you
believe
me
worthy
i
will
be
also
your
counsellor
i
have
a
lucid
intuition
of
things
and
a
hundred
times
i
have
experienced
this
lucidity
which
has
never
led
me
into
error
my
sole
care
will
be
to
please
you
always
never
to
be
a
burden
in
your
life
in
me
you
should
find
only
sweetness
and
repose
i
have
many
faults
my
friend
but
you
will
aid
me
to
conquer
them
you
will
make
me
for
yourself
i
await
from
you
the
first
encouragement
later
when
i
am
sure
of
myself
i
will
say
to
you
now
i
am
worthy
now
i
have
the
consciousness
of
being
what
you
desire
and
you
too
will
be
proud
to
think
that
i
owe
you
all
that
i
am
your
creature
in
everything
and
then
it
will
seem
to
you
that
i
am
more
intimately
yours
and
you
will
love
me
always
more
always
more
it
will
be
a
life
of
love
such
as
has
never
before
been
seen
in
a
postscript
i
send
you
a
rhododendron
gathered
in
the
park
of
isola
madre
yesterday
in
the
pocket
of
that
gray
dress
which
you
know
i
found
the
note
from
albano
which
i
had
asked
you
for
as
a
souvenir
it
is
dated
it
has
been
marked
with
several
of
do
you
recall
our
great
fires
of
love
courage
courage
the
renewal
of
happiness
is
approaching
in
one
week
in
ten
days
at
the
most
i
shall
be
wherever
it
pleases
you
with
you
no
matter
where
ii
and
george
who
at
heart
hardly
believed
in
success
but
who
was
suddenly
seized
by
an
insensate
ardor
attempted
the
supreme
test
he
left
guardiagrele
for
the
littoral
in
quest
of
the
hermitage
the
country
the
sea
the
motion
the
physical
activity
the
variety
of
the
incidents
strewn
along
the
course
of
this
exploration
the
singularity
of
his
own
these
new
things
stirred
him
restored
his
equilibrium
gave
him
an
illusory
confidence
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
just
escaped
by
a
miracle
from
the
assault
of
a
mortal
malady
in
which
he
had
been
face
to
face
with
death
for
the
first
few
days
life
had
for
him
that
sweetness
and
depth
which
it
only
has
for
convalescents
hippolyte
s
romantic
dream
floated
about
his
heart
if
she
should
succeed
in
curing
me
to
cure
me
would
require
a
and
he
avoided
looking
into
the
very
bottom
of
his
conscience
he
fought
shy
of
the
interior
sarcasm
that
those
two
adjectives
provoked
on
earth
there
is
but
one
durable
intoxication
in
the
possession
of
another
creature
absolute
and
unshakable
security
this
intoxication
i
am
seeking
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
say
my
loved
one
present
or
absent
lives
entirely
in
me
my
will
is
her
only
law
if
i
ceased
to
love
her
she
would
die
in
dying
she
will
regret
only
my
love
instead
of
resigning
himself
to
enjoy
love
in
the
form
of
suffering
he
persisted
in
following
it
in
the
form
of
pleasure
he
felt
that
his
mind
was
corroded
irreparably
once
more
he
felt
he
had
degraded
his
manhood
he
discovered
the
hermitage
at
san
vito
in
the
land
of
the
furze
on
the
borders
of
the
adriatic
it
was
the
ideal
house
built
on
a
plateau
up
on
the
cliffs
in
a
grove
of
orange
and
olive
trees
facing
a
little
bay
closed
in
by
two
promontories
very
primitive
the
architecture
of
the
house
an
outer
stairway
led
up
to
a
loggia
on
which
opened
the
four
doors
of
four
rooms
each
room
had
its
door
and
in
the
wall
opposite
a
window
looking
out
on
the
to
the
upper
loggia
there
was
a
corresponding
lower
loggia
but
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
with
the
exception
of
one
were
uninhabitable
on
one
side
the
house
was
contiguous
to
an
old
ruin
inhabited
by
the
peasants
who
owned
it
two
enormous
oaks
that
the
persevering
breath
of
the
northerly
winds
had
bent
towards
the
hill
shaded
the
court
and
protected
the
stone
tables
useful
for
dining
in
summer
time
this
court
was
surrounded
by
a
stone
parapet
and
rising
above
the
parapet
loaded
with
odorous
bloom
delineated
against
the
background
of
the
sea
the
delicate
elegance
of
their
foliage
this
house
was
used
only
for
lodging
strangers
who
rented
it
for
the
bathing
season
according
to
the
industry
practised
by
all
the
villagers
of
the
coast
in
the
region
of
san
vito
it
was
about
two
miles
distant
from
the
borough
on
the
border
of
a
territory
called
portelles
in
quiet
and
mild
solitude
each
of
the
two
promontories
was
pierced
by
a
tunnel
the
two
openings
of
which
were
visible
from
the
house
the
railroad
ran
from
one
to
the
other
in
a
straight
line
along
the
shore
a
distance
of
from
five
to
six
hundred
yards
at
the
extreme
point
of
the
promontory
on
a
bank
of
rocks
the
trabocco
stretched
a
strange
fishing
machine
constructed
entirely
of
beams
and
planks
like
a
colossal
the
tenant
out
of
season
was
greeted
like
an
unhoped
for
and
extraordinary
piece
of
good
fortune
the
head
of
the
family
an
old
man
said
the
house
is
yours
he
refused
to
name
a
price
and
said
if
you
are
satisfied
with
it
you
will
give
me
what
you
wish
and
when
you
please
while
uttering
these
cordial
words
he
examined
the
stranger
with
an
eye
so
scrutinizing
that
the
latter
was
embarrassed
and
surprised
by
this
too
piercing
look
the
old
man
was
blind
with
one
eye
bald
on
the
top
of
his
head
with
two
little
tufts
of
white
hair
on
the
temples
his
chin
was
shaven
and
he
carried
his
entire
body
before
him
sustained
by
two
bow
legs
his
limbs
were
deformed
by
hard
work
by
the
labor
at
the
plough
which
advances
the
right
shoulder
and
twists
the
body
by
the
labor
of
mowing
which
forces
the
knees
apart
by
the
labor
of
thinning
the
vines
which
bends
the
body
in
two
by
all
the
slow
and
patient
labors
of

give
what
you
wish
he
had
already
scented
in
this
affable
young
man
with
his
somewhat
distracted
and
almost
wandering
air
the
generous
milord
inexperienced
careless
of
money
he
knew
that
the
generosity
of
his
guest
would
be
much
more
profitable
for
him
than
if
he
made
his
own
terms
george
asked
is
the
place
quiet
without
visitors
without
noise
the
old
man
pointed
to
the
sea
and
smiled
look
you
will
hear
nothing
but
that
he
added
sometimes
the
sound
of
the
loom
too
but
now
candia
hardly
weaves
at
all
and
he
smiled
pointing
to
the
threshold
where
stood
his
blushing
she
was
already
very
large
at
the
waist
blond
a
clear
carnation
her
face
sown
with
freckles
she
had
big
gray
eyes
the
iris
veined
like
agates
she
wore
in
her
ears
two
heavy
gold
rings
and
on
her
bosom
the
presenfoso
a
large
star
of
filigree
work
with
two
hearts
in
the
centre
on
the
threshold
beside
her
was
a
little
girl
of
ten
a
blonde
also
with
a
sweet
expression
one
could
drink
down
that
little
madcap
in
a
glass
said
the
old
man
that
s
all
there
are
only
us
and
albadora
he
turned
toward
the
and
began
to
call
albadora
albadò
then
addressing
his
granddaughter
helen
go
and
call
her
he
said
helen
disappeared
children

the
old
man
albadora
gave
me
boys
and
sixteen
girls
i
have
lost
three
boys
and
seven
girls
the
other
nine
girls
are
married
one
of
my
boys
went
to
america
another
has
made
his
home
in
tocco
and
works
in
the
petroleum
mines
the
youngest
the
one
whom
candia
married
is
employed
on
the
railway
and
only
visits
us
every
two
weeks
we
are
left
all
alone
ah
signor
it
is
well
said
that
one
father
supports
a
hundred
children
and
that
a
hundred
children
do
not
support
one
father
the
septuagenarian
sibyl
appeared
bearing
in
her
apron
a
heap
of
large
a
slimy
and
flaccid
heap
from
which
protruded
long
tentacles
she
was
a
woman
of
tall
stature
but
bent
emaciated
broken
by
fatigue
and
by
frequent
pregnancies
weakened
by
childbirths
with
a
small
head
wrinkled
like
a
withered
apple
on
a
neck
full
of
hollows
and
tendons
in
her
apron
the
snails
stuck
together
twisted
about
one
another
glued
to
one
another
greenish
yellowish
whitish
frothy
with
colorations
of
pale
iridescent
reflections
one
of
them
had
crawled
up
on
her
hand
the
old
man
exclaimed
this
gentleman
wishes
to
rent
the
house
from
on
god
bless
you
she
cried
and
with
a
rather
silly
yet
kind
air
she
drew
closer
to
george
leering
at
him
with
eyes
sunk
deep
in
their
orbits
almost
sightless
she
added
it
s
jesus
come
back
to
earth
god
bless
you
may
you
live
as
long
as
there
s
bread
and
wine
may
you
become
as
great
as
the
sun
and
with
a
joyous
step
she
passed
on
into
the
house
through
the
same
door
which
all
her
children
had
passed
through
on
their
way
to
baptism
the
old
man
said
to
george
my
name
is
colas
di
cinzio
but
as
my
father
s
surname
was
sciampagne
everybody
calls
me
colas
di
sciampagne
come
and
see
the
garden
george
followed
the
peasant
the
crops
are
very
promising
this
year
the
old
man
walking
in
front
praised
the
plantations
and
as
is
common
with
persons
who
have
grown
old
in
the
midst
of
nature
he
made
prognostications
the
garden
was
luxuriant
and
seemed
to
enclose
in
its
circle
all
the
gifts
of
abundance
the
shed
such
waves
of
perfume
that
at
moments
the
atmosphere
acquired
a
sweet
and
powerful
savor
like
that
of
a
generous
wine
the
other
were
no
longer
in
flower
but
their
innumerable
fruits
hung
from
nourishing
branches
rocked
by
the
breath
of
heaven
george
thought
this
perhaps
is
what
the
superior
life
would
be
a
limitless
liberty
a
noble
and
fruitful
solitude
which
would
envelop
me
with
its
warmest
emanations
to
journey
on
amidst
the
vegetal
creation
as
one
would
amongst
a
multitude
of
intelligences
to
wrest
from
it
the
occult
thought
and
to
divine
the
mute
sentiment
which
reigns
beneath
the
externals
to
successively
render
my
being
comfortable
with
each
of
these
beings
and
to
successively
substitute
for
my
weakened
and
oblique
soul
each
of
these
simple
and
strong
souls
to
contemplate
nature
with
such
a
continuity
of
attention
that
i
should
succeed
in
reproducing
in
my
own
person
the
harmonious
palpitation
of
all
creatures
finally
by
a
laborious
and
ideal
metamorphosis
identify
myself
with
the
robust
tree
whose
roots
absorb
the
invisible
subterranean
ferments
and
whose
summit
imitates
by
its
agitation
the
voice
of
the
sea
would
not
that
be
truly
a
superior
life
at
the
sight
of
the
exuberance
that
transfigured
the
surrounding
places
he
permitted
himself
to
be
dominated
by
a
sort
of
drunken
panic
but
the
fatal
habit
of
contradiction
cut
short
this
transport
brought
him
back
to
his
old
ideas
opposed
reality
to
dreams
we
have
no
contact
whatever
with
nature
we
have
only
the
imperfect
perception
of
exterior
forms
it
is
impossible
for
man
to
enter
into
communion
with
things
man
has
certainly
the
power
to
inject
into
things
all
his
own
substance
but
he
never
receives
anything
in
return
the
sea
will
never
speak
to
him
in
an
intelligible
language
the
earth
will
never
reveal
to
him
its
secret
man
may
feel
all
his
blood
circulate
in
the
fibres
of
the
tree
but
the
tree
will
never
give
him
one
drop
of
its
vital
sap
pointing
out
with
his
finger
such
or
such
a
marvel
of
luxuriance
the
old
peasant
said
a
stableful
of
dung
performs
more
miracles
than
a
churchful
of
saints
pointing
with
his
finger
to
a
field
of
flowering
beans
at
the
end
of
the
garden
he
said
the
bean
is
the
spy
of
the
year
the
field
undulated
almost
imperceptibly
the
small
leaves
of
a
grayish
green
agitated
their
thin
points
beneath
the
white
or
azure
flowering
every
flower
resembled
a
mouth
and
bore
two
spots
black
as
eyes
among
those
that
were
not
yet
faded
the
superior
petals
slightly
covered
the
spots
like
pale
eyelids
on
pupils
which
regard
sidewise
the
quivering
of
all
those
lipped
and
eyed
flowers
had
a
strange
animal
expression
attractive
and
indescribable
george
thought
how
happy
hippolyte
will
be
here
she
has
a
delicate
and
passionate
taste
for
all
the
humble
beauties
of
the
earth
i
remember
her
little
cries
of
admiration
and
pleasure
on
discovering
some
plant
of
unknown
form
a
new
flower
a
leaf
a
bay
a
bizarre
insect
a
shadow
a
reflection
he
pictured
her
to
himself
slim
and
agile
in
graceful
attitudes
among
the
verdure
and
an
anguish
suddenly
overwhelmed
him
the
anguish
of
taking
her
again
of
reconquering
her
entirely
of
making
himself
loved
immensely
by
her
of
giving
her
a
new
joy
every
second
her
eyes
will
be
always
filled
with
me
all
her
senses
will
remain
closed
to
all
sensations
but
those
that
will
come
to
her
from
me
my
words
will
seem
to
her
more
delicious
than
any
other
sound
suddenly
the
power
of
love
appeared
to
him
to
be
unlimited
his
inner
life
acquired
a
vertiginous
acceleration
when
he
mounted
the
stairway
of
the
hermitage
he
believed
that
his
heart
would
break
under
the
pressure
of
his
increasing
anxiety
arrived
at
the
loggia
he
took
in
the
landscape
with
an
intoxicated
look
in
his
profound
agitation
he
believed
he
felt
that
at
that
minute
the
sun
beamed
truly
on
the
bottom
of
his
heart
the
sea
stirred
by
an
equal
and
continuous
thrill
reflecting
the
happiness
scattered
in
the
sky
seemed
to
refract
this
happiness
in
myriads
of
inextinguishable
smiles
through
the
crystal
air
all
the
distant
vistas
were
clearly
vasto
point
mount
gargano
the
tremiti
islands
on
the
right
cape
moro
the
nicchiola
cape
ortona
on
the
left
the
white
ortona
resembled
a
glittering
asiatic
city
on
a
hill
in
palestine
standing
boldly
against
the
azure
all
in
parallel
lines
without
minarets
that
chain
of
promontories
and
gulfs
in
the
shape
of
a
suggested
the
image
of
a
row
of
offerings
because
each
handle
bore
a
cereal
treasure
the
furze
spread
its
mantle
of
gold
over
the
entire
coast
from
every
bush
arose
a
dense
cloud
of
effluvia
as
from
a
censer
the
air
respired
was
just
as
delicious
as
a
sip
of
elixir
iii
the
first
few
days
george
gave
all
his
care
to
the
little
house
which
was
to
receive
the
new
life
within
its
great
peace
and
to
help
him
in
the
preparations
he
had
colas
di
sciampagne
who
seemed
expert
at
all
trades
on
a
band
of
fresh
plastering
he
had
written
with
the
point
of
a
reed
this
old
device
suggested
by
the
illusion
domus
magna
and
he
saw
a
favorable
presage
even
in
the
three
blades
of
bay
sown
by
the
wind
between
the
interstices
of
the
raised
edge
of
the
window
but
when
all
was
ready
and
this
false
energy
had
gone
he
found
again
in
his
inmost
self
the
inquietude
the
discontent
and
that
implacable
anguish
the
true
cause
of
which
he
did
not
know
he
felt
confusedly
that
his
destiny
had
once
more
pushed
him
into
an
oblique
and
perilous
pass
it
seemed
to
him
that
from
another
house
and
from
other
lips
there
came
to
him
now
a
voice
of
recall
and
reproach
in
his
soul
there
revived
the
heartbreaking
farewells
tearless
and
yet
so
cruel
in
which
he
had
lied
from
shame
on
reading
in
his
deceived
mother
s
tired
eyes
the
question
too
sad
are
you
abandoning
me
was
it
not
this
mute
question
the
recollection
of
that
blush
and
that
lie
which
inspired
him
with
the
inquietude
the
discontent
and
the
anguish
at
the
moment
that
he
was
about
to
enter
the
new
life
and
how
could
he
silence
that
voice
by
what
intoxication
he
did
not
dare
reply
in
spite
of
his
deep
trouble
he
wished
still
to
believe
in
the
promise
of
her
who
was
going
to
come
he
hoped
to
be
able
still
to
attribute
to
his
love
a
high
moral
signification
had
he
not
an
ardent
desire
to
live
to
give
to
all
the
forces
of
his
nature
a
rhythmic
development
to
feel
himself
complete
and
harmonious
love
would
finally
effect
this
prodigy
he
would
finally
find
in
love
the
plenitude
of
his
humanity
deformed
and
diminished
by
so
many
miseries
with
these
hopes
and
these
vague
tendencies
he
sought
to
cheat
his
remorse
but
what
dominated
him
in
presence
of
this
woman
s
image
was
always
desire
in
despite
of
all
his
platonic
aspirations
he
could
not
succeed
in
seeing
in
love
anything
else
but
the
work
of
the
flesh
could
not
imagine
the
days
to
come
but
as
a
succession
of
already
familiar
sensual
pleasures
in
that
benign
solitude
in
the
company
of
that
passionate
woman
what
life
could
he
live
if
not
a
life
of
idleness
and
voluptuousness
and
all
the
past
sorrows
came
back
to
his
mind
with
all
the
painful
pictures
his
mother
s
haggard
face
and
swollen
red
eyes
scorched
by
tears
christine
s
sweet
and
smile
the
large
head
of
the
sickly
child
always
leaning
on
a
bosom
barren
of
all
but
sighs
the
cadaveric
mask
of
the
poor
idiotic
gormand
and
his
mother
s
tired
eyes
asked
are
you
abandoning
me
iv
it
was
the
afternoon
george
explored
the
tortuous
path
which
by
a
succession
of
ups
and
downs
led
towards
the
vasto
point
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
he
gazed
before
and
around
him
with
a
curiosity
always
awake
almost
betraying
an
effort
to
be
attentive
as
if
he
wished
to
surprise
some
obscure
thought
translated
by
these
simple
semblances
or
to
render
himself
master
of
some
unseizable
secret
in
a
fold
of
the
hill
which
followed
the
sea
line
the
water
of
a
stream
derived
from
a
sort
of
small
aqueduct
made
from
hollowed
trunks
and
sustained
by
dead
trees
traversed
the
dale
from
one
shore
to
the
other
there
were
also
trenches
carried
in
hollow
tiles
as
far
as
the
fertile
field
where
the
crops
were
prospering
and
here
and
there
on
the
reflecting
and
murmuring
trenches
beautiful
violet
flowers
bent
with
airy
grace
all
these
humble
things
appeared
to
have
a
profound
life
and
the
excess
of
water
ran
and
spread
on
the
slope
towards
the
sandy
beach
passing
beneath
a
small
bridge
in
the
shade
of
the
arch
several
women
were
washing
linen
and
their
gestures
were
reflected
in
the
water
as
in
a
mobile
mirror
on
the
beach
the
linen
spread
out
in
the
sun
was
of
dazzling
whiteness
a
man
was
walking
along
the
railroad
tracks
his
feet
naked
carrying
his
shoes
hanging
in
his
hand
a
woman
came
out
of
the
and
with
a
rapid
gesture
threw
some
débris
from
out
of
a
basket
two
little
girls
loaded
with
linen
were
running
each
trying
to
outdo
the
other
laughing
an
old
woman
was
hanging
skeins
from
a
pole
beyond
on
the
slope
of
the
earth
wall
that
bordered
the
path
small
shells
made
white
spots
fragile
roots
fluttered
in
the
wind
the
traces
of
the
pickaxe
that
had
cut
into
the
earth
were
still
distinguishable
from
the
top
of
a
heap
of
earth
hung
a
tuft
of
dead
roots
as
light
as
the
scales
of
a
serpent
farther
on
was
a
large
farmhouse
with
a
porcelain
flower
at
the
summit
of
its
tiled
roof
an
outer
stairway
led
up
to
a
covered
gallery
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
two
women
were
spinning
and
beneath
the
sun
their
distaffs
had
the
resplendency
of
gold
one
could
hear
the
clicking
of
a
weaving
machine
through
the
window
could
be
seen
a
weaver
and
her
rhythmic
gesture
as
she
plied
the
shuttle
lying
down
in
a
neighboring
field
was
a
gray
ox
a
beast
of
enormous
size
shaking
ears
and
tail
peacefully
and
unceasingly
in
order
to
chase
away
the
flies
around
him
chickens
were
scratching
a
little
farther
a
second
stream
traversed
the
rippling
gay
frisking
limpid
a
little
farther
on
still
near
another
house
there
was
a
silent
garden
full
of
bushy
laurels
closed
all
round
the
stems
slender
and
straight
rose
up
motionless
with
their
crown
of
shining
foliage
and
one
of
these
laurels
the
most
robust
was
entirely
enveloped
by
a
large
amorous
bryonia
which
triumphed
over
the
austere
foliage
by
the
delicacy
of
its
snowlike
flowers
and
by
the
freshness
of
its
nuptial
perfume
below
the
earth
seemed
to
have
been
newly
turned
over
in
a
corner
a
black
cross
shed
over
the
mute
enclosure
that
sort
of
resigned
sadness
which
reigns
in
cemeteries
at
the
end
of
the
path
could
be
seen
a
stairway
half
in
the
sun
and
half
in
the
shadow
by
which
one
mounted
to
a
door
which
protected
two
branches
of
a
blessed
suspended
at
the
rustic
architrave
below
on
the
last
step
an
old
man
was
seated
asleep
his
head
bare
his
chin
on
his
breast
his
hands
resting
on
his
knees
and
the
sun
was
about
to
touch
his
venerable
brow
from
above
through
the
door
as
if
to
favor
the
senile
slumber
descended
the
equal
sound
of
a
cradle
rocking
and
the
equal
cadence
of
a
hummed
ballad
all
these
humble
things
seemed
to
have
a
profound
life
hippolyte
announced
that
according
to
her
promise
she
would
arrive
at
san
vito
tuesday
may
by
train
direct
about
one
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
that
would
be
in
two
days
george
wrote
to
her
come
come
i
await
you
and
never
was
waiting
more
tantalizing
every
minute
that
passes
is
irremediably
lost
to
happiness
come
everything
is
ready
or
rather
no
nothing
is
ready
save
my
desire
it
is
necessary
my
friend
that
you
provide
yourself
with
an
inextinguishable
fund
of
patience
and
indulgence
because
in
this
savage
and
impracticable
solitude
every
commodity
of
life
is
lacking
oh
how
impracticable
picture
to
yourself
my
friend
that
from
the
station
of
san
vito
to
the
hermitage
takes
of
an
hour
by
road
and
to
cover
this
distance
the
only
means
is
to
follow
on
foot
the
path
cut
through
the
granite
rising
perpendicularly
from
the
sea
you
must
be
careful
to
come
provided
with
heavy
shoes
and
gigantic
parasols
as
to
dresses
it
is
useless
to
bring
many
a
few
gay
and
durable
costumes
for
our
morning
walks
will
suffice
do
not
forget
your
bathing
suit
this
letter
is
the
last
i
shall
write
you
you
will
get
it
a
few
hours
before
you
start
i
am
writing
you
in
a
room
in
which
there
are
heaps
of
books
which
we
are
hardly
likely
to
read
the
afternoon
is
grayish
and
the
sea
stretches
out
in
endless
monotony
the
hour
is
discreet
languorous
propitious
for
delicate
sensualities
oh
if
you
were
with
me
this
evening
will
be
my
second
night
at
the
hermitage
and
i
shall
spend
it
alone
if
you
only
saw
the
bed
it
is
a
rustic
bed
a
monumental
hymeneal
altar
large
as
a
field
deep
as
the
slumber
of
the
the
mattresses
contain
the
wool
of
an
entire
flock
the
contains
the
shucks
of
an
entire
field
of
maize
can
these
chaste
things
have
the
presentiment
of
your
nudity
how
slowly
the
hours
go
by
who
says
time
has
wings
i
do
not
know
what
i
would
give
if
i
could
go
to
sleep
in
this
enervating
languor
and
not
awake
until
tuesday
morning
but
no
i
will
not
sleep
i
too
have
killed
my
sleep
i
have
the
constant
vision
of
your
mouth
vi
for
several
days
voluptuous
visions
had
haunted
him
without
a
truce
desire
awoke
in
his
flesh
with
inconceivable
violence
a
warm
puff
of
air
a
waft
of
perfume
the
rustle
of
a
skirt
mere
trifles
sufficed
to
modify
his
entire
being
to
make
him
languorous
to
light
up
his
face
with
a
flame
to
accelerate
the
pulsations
of
his
arteries
to
throw
him
into
an
agitation
bordering
on
delirium
at
the
profoundest
depths
of
his
substance
he
bore
the
germs
inherited
from
his
father
he
the
creature
of
thought
and
sentiment
had
in
his
flesh
the
fatal
heredity
of
that
brutish
being
but
in
him
instinct
had
become
a
passion
and
sensuality
had
assumed
almost
morbid
forms
he
was
as
grieved
over
this
as
if
it
were
a
shameful
malady
he
had
a
horror
of
these
fevers
which
assailed
him
unexpectedly
which
consumed
him
miserably
which
left
him
debased
arid
powerless
to
think
he
suffered
from
certain
passions
as
though
they
degraded
him
certain
sudden
passages
of
brutality
similar
to
hurricanes
over
a
growing
field
devastated
his
mind
dried
up
all
his
inner
sources
made
painful
furrows
which
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
succeed
in
filling
up
at
the
dawn
of
the
great
day
as
he
awoke
after
a
few
hours
of
a
restless
dozing
he
thought
with
a
thrill
of
all
his
nerves
she
arrives
in
the
light
of
my
eyes
will
see
her
i
will
hold
her
in
my
arms
it
almost
seems
to
me
as
if
it
will
be
the
first
possession
it
seems
to
me
too
that
i
could
die
of
it
the
vision
conjured
up
gave
him
so
rude
a
shock
that
he
felt
his
body
traversed
from
tip
to
toe
by
a
start
similar
to
that
caused
by
an
electric
discharge
in
him
appeared
those
terrible
physical
phenomena
against
the
tyranny
of
which
he
was
defenceless
all
his
conscience
fell
beneath
the
absolute
empire
of
desire
once
more
the
hereditary
lewdness
broke
out
with
an
invincible
fury
in
this
delicate
lover
whom
it
pleased
to
call
his
mistress
sister
and
who
had
a
thirst
for
spiritual
communions
he
contemplated
in
mind
his
mistress
s
beauty
and
every
contour
seen
through
the
flame
assumed
in
his
eyes
a
radiant
splendor
chimerical
almost
superhuman
he
contemplated
in
mind
his
mistress
s
grace
and
every
attitude
assumed
a
voluptuous
fascination
of
inconceivable
intensity
in
her
all
was
light
perfume
and
rhythm
this
admirable
creature
he
he
alone
but
spontaneously
as
the
smoke
rises
from
a
poor
fire
a
jealous
thought
disengaged
itself
from
his
desire
to
dissipate
the
agitation
which
he
felt
growing
he
sprang
from
the
bed
at
the
window
at
dawn
the
branches
had
an
imperceptible
undulation
pale
between
gray
and
white
the
sound
of
the
sparrows
discreetly
twittering
was
heard
above
the
dull
monotonous
wash
of
the
sea
in
a
stable
a
lamb
bleated
timidly
he
went
out
into
the
loggia
comforted
by
the
tonic
virtue
of
a
bath
and
drank
in
deeply
the
morning
air
charged
with
savory
odors
his
lungs
dilated
his
thoughts
took
their
flight
agile
each
marked
with
the
image
of
the
woman
a
feeling
of
renewed
youth
made
his
heart
palpitate
before
him
was
the
maturity
of
the
sun
pure
simple
without
a
vestige
of
clouds
without
mystery
above
the
silver
sea
arose
a
crimson
disk
clearly
defined
almost
sharp
like
a
disk
of
metal
fresh
from
the
forge
colas
di
sciampagne
who
was
busy
cleaning
the
court
cried
out
to
him
is
a
great
holiday
the
lady
is
coming
the
corn
comes
into
the
ear
without
waiting
for
the
ascension
george
smiled
at
the
courteous
remark
of
the
old
man
and
asked
did
you
think
of
the
women
to
gather
the
furze
flowers
the
entire
length
of
the
road
must
be
strewn
with
them
the
old
man
gave
an
impatient
gesture
as
if
to
signify
that
he
required
no
reminder
i
sent
for
five
and
he
named
them
showing
the
places
where
the
young
girls
lived
the
monkey
s
daughter
the
ogress
s
daughter
favetta
splendor
and
garbin
s
daughter
these
names
provoked
in
george
a
sudden
mirth
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
the
spirit
of
springtime
entered
into
his
heart
that
a
wave
of
fragrant
poesy
inundated
it
did
not
these
virgins
step
out
of
a
fairy
tale
to
strew
flowers
on
the
road
under
the
feet
of
the
beautiful
roman
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
anxious
enjoyment
of
expectation
he
asked
restlessly
where
are
they
gathering
their
harvest
of
furze
up
yonder
replied
colas
di
sciampagne
pointing
to
the
hillock
up
yonder
on
the
chesnaie
their
singing
will
guide
you
in
fact
a
feminine
chant
came
at
intervals
from
the
hill
george
started
up
the
incline
in
search
of
the
singers
the
small
tortuous
path
wound
through
a
copse
of
young
oaks
at
a
certain
place
it
branched
out
into
a
number
of
paths
the
ends
of
which
could
not
be
seen
and
the
narrow
groves
hollowed
between
the
thickets
crossed
by
innumerable
roots
close
to
the
ground
formed
a
sort
of
mountainous
labyrinth
in
which
the
sparrows
twittered
and
the
blackbirds
whistled
george
led
by
both
chant
and
perfume
did
not
go
astray
he
found
the
field
of
furze
it
was
a
plateau
on
which
the
furze
flourished
so
plentifully
that
it
presented
to
the
eye
the
uniformity
of
a
vast
yellow
mantle
resplendent
the
five
lasses
were
gathering
the
flowering
branches
in
order
to
fill
their
baskets
and
were
singing
they
were
singing
at
the
top
of
their
voices
in
a
perfect
chord
of
the
third
and
fifth
when
they
came
to
the
refrain
they
straightened
up
above
the
bushes
to
permit
the
note
to
more
freely
emerge
from
their
unconfined
chests
and
they
held
the
note
a
long
time
looking
in
each
other
s
eyes
holding
before
them
their
hands
full
of
flowers
at
the
sight
of
the
stranger
they
stopped
and
bent
over
the
bushes
laughter
ran
along
the
yellow
carpet
george
asked
which
of
you
is
named
favetta
a
young
girl
brown
as
an
olive
rose
to
reply
astonished
almost
afraid
it
is
i
signor
aren
t
you
the
best
singer
in
san
vito
no
signor
that
is
not
true
it
is
true
it
is
true
cried
all
her
companions
make
her
sing
signor
she
denied
it
laughing
her
face
on
fire
and
while
her
companions
insisted
she
twisted
her
apron
she
was
of
small
stature
but
very
well
formed
her
bosom
large
and
heaving
developed
by
singing
she
had
curly
hair
heavy
eyebrows
an
aquiline
nose
a
rather
defiant
carriage
of
her
head
after
several
refusals
she
consented
her
companions
threw
their
arms
around
her
imprisoned
her
in
their
circle
they
emerged
from
among
the
flowering
tufts
up
to
their
waists
amid
the
buzzing
of
the
diligent
bees
favetta
commenced
at
first
timidly
then
note
by
note
her
voice
became
more
assured
she
had
a
limpid
voice
fluid
crystalline
as
a
spring
of
water
she
sang
a
distich
and
her
companions
took
up
the
refrain
in
chorus
they
prolonged
the
final
notes
in
unison
their
mouths
close
together
so
as
to
make
but
one
vocal
wave
and
this
wave
undulated
in
the
light
with
the
slowness
of
liturgic
cadences
favetta
sang
all
the
fountains
are
dry
my
love
is
dying
of
thirst
tromme

i
am
thirsty
oh
so
thirsty
where
is

a
bowl
of
potter
s
clay
suspended
from
a
chain
of
gold
tromme
lari
lira
love
forever
and
her
companions
repeated
love
forever
this
salutation
of
may
to
love
gushing
from
these
bosoms
which
perhaps
did
not
know
it
yet
which
perhaps
would
never
know
its
veritable
sorrows
resounded
in
george
s
ears
like
a
good
augury
the
girls
the
flowers
the
woods
the
sea
all
these
free
and
unconscious
things
which
breathed
around
him
the
voluptuousness
of
that
caressed
the
surface
of
his
soul
soothed
lulled
him
in
the
habitual
sentiment
that
he
had
concerning
his
own
being
gave
him
an
increasing
harmonious
and
rhythmic
sensation
of
a
new
faculty
which
had
developed
little
by
little
in
the
intimacy
of
his
substance
and
that
would
be
revealed
to
him
in
a
very
vague
manner
as
in
a
sort
of
confused
vision
of
a
divine
secret
it
was
a
fugitive
enchantment
a
state
of
consciousness
so
exceptional
and
so
incomprehensible
that
he
could
not
retain
even
its
phantom
the
singers
pointed
to
the
already
overflowing
heap
of
flowers
humid
with
dew
favetta
asked
will
that
do
no
no
that
won
t
be
enough
keep
on
gathering
them
the
entire
road
from
the
trabocco
to
the
house
must
be
strewn
the
stairway
the
loggia
must
be
covered
but
what
shall
we
do
for
ascension
day
won
t
you
leave
a
single
flower
for
jesus
vii
she
had
arrived
she
had
trod
on
the
flowers
like
the
madonna
who
is
going
to
perform
a
miracle
she
had
trod
on
a
carpet
of
flowers
she
had
at
last
arrived
she
had
at
last
crossed
the
threshold
and
now
tired
happy
she
presented
to
her
lover
s
lips
a
face
all
bathed
in
tears
without
speaking
with
a
gesture
of
inexpressible
abandon
tired
happy
she
wept
and
smiled
beneath
the
innumerable
kisses
of
the
adored
one
what
mattered
the
recollections
of
the
days
from
which
he
had
been
absent
what
mattered
the
miseries
the
chagrins
the
anxieties
the
struggles
against
the
inexorable
brutalities
of
life
what
mattered
all
the
discouragements
and
all
the
despairs
in
comparison
with
this
supreme
joy
she
lived
she
respired
between
her
lover
s
arms
she
felt
herself
infinitely
loved
all
else
disappeared
returned
to
oblivion
seemed
to
have
never
existed
oh
hippolyte
hippolyte
oh
my
soul
how
much
how
much
i
have
longed
for
you
and
here
you
are
and
now
you
will
stay
with
me
a
long
long
time
will
you
not
before
leaving
me
you
will
kill
me
and
he
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
on
the
cheeks
on
the
neck
on
the
eyes
insatiable
profoundly
thrilled
every
time
he
met
a
tear
those
tears
that
smile
that
expression
of
felicity
on
the
face
the
thought
that
this
woman
had
not
hesitated
for
a
second
in
consenting
the
thought
that
she
had
come
to
him
from
a
great
distance
and
that
after
a
fatiguing
journey
she
wept
beneath
his
kisses
powerless
to
say
a
word
because
her
heart
was
too
these
passionate
and
delightful
things
refined
his
sensations
freed
his
desire
from
impurity
gave
him
an
emotion
of
almost
chaste
love
exalted
his
soul
removing
the
long
pin
that
fastened
the
hat
and
veil
he
said
how
tired
you
must
be
my
poor
hippolyte
you
are
very
pale
her
veil
was
raised
on
her
brow
she
still
had
on
her
travelling
cloak
and
her
gloves
he
removed
the
veil
and
hat
with
a
gesture
that
was
customary
with
him
the
beautiful
brown
head
appeared
unencumbered
with
that
simple
coiffure
which
made
of
the
hair
a
sort
of
adherent
helmet
without
altering
the
delicate
and
elegant
outline
of
the
occiput
without
hiding
any
of
the
nape
of
the
neck
she
wore
a
gorget
of
white
lace
and
a
narrow
black
velvet
ribbon
which
was
defined
with
exquisite
violence
against
the
whiteness
of
the
skin
under
the
cloak
could
be
seen
a
gray
cloth
dress
of
the
memorable
albano
days
she
spread
around
her
a
faint
odor
of
violets
the
familiar
perfume
george
s
lips
became
more
ardent
and
as
she
used
to
say
more
he
checked
himself
he
removed
her
cloak
he
helped
her
to
remove
her
gloves
he
took
her
bare
hands
and
pressed
them
against
his
temples
in
a
mad
desire
to
be
caressed
and
hippolyte
holding
him
thus
by
the
temples
drew
him
towards
her
enveloped
him
in
a
long
caress
passed
over
his
entire
face
a
mouth
which
languishing
and
warm
crept
along
in
a
multiple
kiss
george
recognized
the
divine
the
incomparable
mouth
the
mouth
which
he
had
thought
so
often
felt
as
if
it
rested
on
the
surface
of
his
soul
for
a
voluptuousness
which
would
surpass
carnal
sensibility
and
would
communicate
itself
to
an
element
of
the
inner
being
you
will
kill
me
he
murmured
vibrating
like
a
bundle
of
stretched
cords
feeling
at
the
back
of
his
neck
a
lancinating
cold
which
from
vertebra
to
vertebra
was
propagated
through
all
the
marrow
and
at
the
bottom
of
himself
he
noticed
a
vague
movement
of
that
instinctive
terror
which
he
had
already
observed
under
other
circumstances
hippolyte
disengaged
herself
now
i
ll
leave
you
she
said
where
room
oh
george
how
comfortable
we
shall
be
here
she
glanced
around
her
smiling
she
made
a
few
steps
towards
the
threshold
stooped
to
gather
a
handful
of
furze
breathed
in
the
perfume
with
visible
sensual
pleasure
she
once
more
felt
agitated
and
as
if
intoxicated
by
this
sovereign
homage
by
this
fragrant
glory
which
george
had
scattered
along
her
path
was
she
not
dreaming
was
it
she
it
really
hippolyte
sanzio
who
in
this
unknown
place
in
this
magic
landscape
found
herself
surrounded
and
glorified
by
all
this
poesy
suddenly
with
new
tears
in
her
eyes
she
threw
her
arms
around
george
s
neck
and
said
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
this
poesy
intoxicated
her
heart
she
felt
herself
lifted
above
her
humble
existence
by
the
ideal
apotheosis
which
enveloped
her
lover
she
felt
that
she
lived
another
life
a
superior
life
which
at
times
gave
to
her
soul
that
kind
of
choking
sensation
which
a
strong
wind
provokes
in
a
breast
accustomed
to
breathe
an
impoverished
air
how
proud
i
am
to
belong
to
you
you
are
my
pride
one
single
minute
passed
near
you
suffices
to
make
me
feel
another
woman
absolutely
other
you
suddenly
communicate
to
me
another
blood
and
another
mind
i
am
no
longer
hippolyte
the
hippolyte
of
yesterday
give
me
a
new
name
he
named
her
soul
they
fell
into
each
other
s
arms
in
a
furious
embrace
as
if
to
pluck
and
unroot
the
kisses
which
blossomed
on
their
lips
then
hippolyte
disengaged
herself
and
repeated
now
i
ll
leave
you
where
s
my
room
let
me
see
it
george
passed
an
arm
around
her
waist
and
led
her
into
the
bedroom
she
gave
a
cry
of
admiration
when
she
perceived
the
draped
with
a
large
yellow
damask
counterpane
but
we
shall
get
lost
in
it
and
she
laughed
as
she
walked
all
round
the
monument
the
most
difficult
thing
will
be
to
get
into
it
first
you
ll
place
your
foot
upon
my
knee
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
peasants
in
these
parts
what
a
lot
of
saints
she
exclaimed
looking
at
the
long
line
of
pious
images
on
the
wall
at
the
head
of
the
bed
they
must
be
covered
yes
you
are
right
both
had
difficulty
in
finding
words
both
their
voices
were
changed
in
tone
both
of
them
trembled
agitated
by
irresistible
desire
feeling
almost
faint
at
the
thought
of
the
approaching
ecstasies
they
heard
someone
knock
at
the
door
of
the
staircase
george
went
into
the
loggia
it
was
helen
candia
s
daughter
she
came
to
say
that
luncheon
was
ready
what
do
you
wish
to
do
said
george
turning
toward
hippolyte
irresolute
almost
convulsed
really
george
i
have
not
the
least
appetite
i
will
eat
this
evening
if
you
ll
let
me
in
an
agonized
voice
george
said
come
into
your
room
everything
is
ready
for
your
bath
come
he
led
her
into
a
room
which
he
had
covered
all
over
with
large
rustic
mats
you
see
your
trunks
and
your
boxes
are
already
here
now
i
ll
leave
be
quick
remember
i
m
waiting
every
minute
s
delay
will
be
one
torture
more
he
left
her
alone
a
few
moments
later
he
heard
the
splashing
of
the
water
which
ran
from
the
enormous
sponge
and
fell
back
again
into
the
he
knew
the
icy
coldness
of
this
spring
water
well
and
he
imagined
the
little
starts
of
hippolyte
s
body
that
long
and
flexible
body
beneath
the
refreshing
shower
then
there
remained
nothing
in
his
mind
than
thoughts
of
fire
everything
about
him
disappeared
and
when
the
splashing
stopped
he
was
seized
by
a
trembling
so
strong
that
his
teeth
began
to
chatter
as
if
shivering
from
a
mortal
fever
with
the
terrible
eyes
of
desire
he
saw
the
woman
disengage
herself
from
her
already
dried
pure
delicate
as
an
alabaster
with
golden
tones
viii
more
fatigued
now
almost
fainting
hippolyte
sank
gradually
into
slumber
by
degrees
the
smile
on
her
mouth
became
unconscious
disappeared
her
lips
met
for
a
second
then
with
infinite
slowness
they
opened
and
from
between
appeared
a
jasminelike
whiteness
again
the
lips
met
for
a
second
and
again
slowly
very
slowly
they
parted
and
from
between
reappeared
the
whiteness
moistened
raised
on
one
elbow
george
looked
at
her
she
appeared
so
beautiful
so
beautiful
beautiful
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
seen
her
the
first
time
in
the
mysterious
oratory
in
front
of
the
philosopher
alexander
memmi
s
orchestra
amidst
the
evaporated
perfume
of
the
incense
and
the
violets
she
was
pale
very
pale
just
as
on
that
day
she
was
pale
but
it
was
that
singular
pallor
which
george
had
never
found
in
any
other
almost
mortal
pallor
a
profound
and
dead
pallor
which
when
in
the
shade
became
almost
livid
a
long
shadow
was
cast
on
the
upper
part
of
her
cheeks
by
the
eyelashes
a
masculine
shadow
barely
perceptible
veiled
the
upper
lip
the
mouth
large
if
anything
had
a
sinuous
curve
very
soft
and
yet
sad
which
in
the
absolute
silence
took
on
a
very
intense
expression
george
thought
how
spiritual
her
beauty
becomes
in
illness
and
in
languor
tired
as
she
is
now
she
pleases
me
more
i
recognize
the
unknown
woman
who
passed
before
me
that
february
woman
had
not
a
single
drop
of
blood
left
in
her
i
believe
that
when
she
is
dead
she
will
attain
the
supreme
perfection
of
her
beauty
dead
and
if
she
were
to
die
she
would
then
become
an
object
for
thought
a
pure
ideality
i
should
love
her
after
life
without
jealous
inquietude
with
a
soothed
and
always
even
sorrow
he
recalled
that
in
other
circumstances
he
had
already
imagined
hippolyte
s
beauty
in
the
peacefulness
of
death
oh
that
day
of
the
roses
great
sheafs
of
white
roses
languished
in
the
vases
in
june
at
the
beginning
of
their
love
she
was
dozing
on
the
divan
motionless
almost
breathless
and
he
had
contemplated
her
for
a
long
time
then
a
sudden
phantasy
had
taken
him
to
cover
her
with
roses
softly
softly
so
as
not
to
awaken
her
and
he
had
arranged
a
few
roses
in
her
hair
but
thus
flowered
and
garlanded
she
had
appeared
to
him
like
a
body
without
a
soul
a
corpse
this
spectacle
had
filled
him
with
terror
he
had
shaken
her
to
arouse
her
but
she
remained
inert
paralyzed
by
one
of
those
syncopes
to
which
she
was
subject
at
that
time
oh
what
terror
what
anguish
until
she
recovered
her
senses
and
also
what
enthusiasm
for
the
sovereign
beauty
of
that
face
which
was
so
extraordinarily
ennobled
by
that
reflection
of
death
this
episode
recurred
to
his
memory
but
while
he
lingered
over
these
strange
thoughts
he
felt
a
sudden
impulse
of
pity
and
of
remorse
he
bent
over
to
kiss
the
forehead
of
the
sleeper
who
remained
unconscious
of
his
kiss
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
he
restrained
himself
from
embracing
her
more
ardently
so
that
she
might
be
cognizant
of
his
caress
and
respond
to
it
and
then
he
felt
all
the
vanity
of
a
caress
which
would
not
be
to
the
loved
object
a
rapid
communication
of
joy
he
felt
all
the
vanity
of
a
love
which
would
not
be
a
continual
and
immediate
correspondence
of
acute
sensations
he
felt
the
impossibility
of
becoming
intoxicated
unless
an
equally
intense
intoxication
should
correspond
with
his
own
am
i
certain
he
thought
am
i
positively
certain
that
always
when
i
have
enjoyed
her
she
has
enjoyed
me
how
often
has
she
been
present
a
lucid
witness
during
my
moments
of
delirium
how
often
has
my
ardor
appeared
senseless
to
her
a
heavy
wave
of
anxieties
invaded
him
while
he
contemplated
the
sleeping
woman
the
true
and
profound
sensual
communion
is
also
a
chimera
the
senses
of
my
mistress
are
as
obscure
as
her
soul
never
shall
i
succeed
in
surprising
in
her
fibres
a
secret
disgust
an
appetite
unsatisfied
an
irritation
unappeased
never
shall
i
succeed
in
knowing
the
different
sensations
which
are
given
to
her
by
a
similar
caress
repeated
at
different
moments
in
the
course
of
a
single
day
an
organism
as
unhealthy
as
hers
passes
through
a
great
number
of
physical
states
each
in
discord
with
the
other
and
sometimes
in
complete
opposition
such
an
instability
misleads
the
most
penetrating
clairvoyance
the
same
caress
which
at
dawn
draws
from
her
moans
of
pleasure
may
an
hour
later
seem
to
her
importunate
consequently
it
is
possible
that
her
nerves
become
hostile
towards
me
in
spite
of
her
will
a
kiss
which
i
prolong
too
far
and
which
gives
me
the
vertigo
of
supreme
enjoyment
may
in
her
flesh
arouse
impatience
in
the
matter
of
sensuality
however
simulation
and
dissimulation
are
common
to
all
women
to
those
who
love
and
to
those
who
do
not
what
do
i
say
the
woman
who
loves
the
passionate
woman
is
more
inclined
to
physical
simulation
and
dissimulation
because
she
fears
to
grieve
her
lover
if
she
shows
she
is
little
disposed
to
surrender
herself
entirely
moreover
the
passionate
woman
often
delights
in
exaggerating
the
semblance
of
pleasure
because
she
knows
well
that
that
will
flatter
the
man
s
virile
pride
and
increase
his
ecstasy
i
confess
that
a
proud
joy
swells
my
heart
when
i
see
hippolyte
delirious
with
sensual
delight
i
feel
she
is
happy
at
thus
showing
herself
so
vanquished
and
prostrated
by
my
power
and
she
also
knows
that
my
vain
ambition
as
a
young
lover
is
precisely
to
succeed
in
making
her
plead
for
mercy
in
drawing
from
her
a
convulsive
cry
in
seeing
her
fall
back
exhausted
on
the
pillow
which
then
in
these
demonstrations
is
the
share
of
the
physical
sincerity
and
that
of
the
passionate
exaggeration
is
not
her
ardor
an
artificial
attitude
assumed
to
please
me
does
she
not
often
sacrifice
herself
to
my
desire
without
desiring
me
has
she
not
at
times
to
repress
a
commencement
of
repugnance
attentive
and
almost
anxious
he
leaned
over
the
impenetrable
creature
but
little
by
little
the
contemplation
of
her
beauty
seemed
to
appease
him
and
he
began
to
consider
his
new
state
so
from
this
day
on
a
new
life
commenced
for
him
for
a
minute
he
concentrated
mind
and
ear
in
order
to
lose
nothing
of
the
great
peace
surrounding
him
only
the
slow
monotonous
wash
of
the
calm
sea
was
to
be
heard
in
the
propitious
silence
against
the
the
branches
of
the
swayed
imperceptibly
silvered
by
the
sun
balancing
light
shadows
on
the
whiteness
of
the
curtains
at
intervals
a
few
human
voices
were
heard
and
almost
unintelligible
after
this
perception
of
the
environing
peace
he
leaned
once
more
over
the
adored
one
a
manifest
harmony
existed
between
the
respiration
of
the
woman
and
the
respiration
of
the
sea
and
the
concordance
of
the
two
rhythms
gave
an
added
charm
to
the
sleeper
she
reposed
on
her
right
side
in
a
graceful
attitude
her
form
was
supple
and
long
rather
too
long
perhaps
but
of
serpentine
elegance
the
narrowness
of
the
thigh
made
it
resemble
that
of
an
adolescent
the
sterile
abdomen
had
preserved
its
primitive
virginal
purity
the
bosom
was
small
and
firm
as
if
sculptured
in
very
delicate
alabaster
and
the
points
of
her
extraordinarily
erect
breasts
were
of
a
hue
the
posterior
part
of
her
body
from
the
nape
of
the
neck
down
to
the
middle
made
one
think
once
more
of
an
ephebe
it
was
one
of
those
fragments
of
the
ideal
human
type
which
nature
sometimes
throws
among
the
multitude
of
mediocre
imprints
by
which
the
race
perpetuates
itself
but
the
most
precious
singularity
of
this
body
was
in
george
s
eyes
the
coloration
the
skin
had
an
indescribable
color
very
rare
very
different
from
the
ordinary
color
of
brunettes
the
comparison
of
an
alabaster
gilded
by
an
inner
flame
but
scarcely
conveyed
the
idea
of
this
divine
fineness
it
seemed
that
a
diffusion
of
gold
and
impalpable
amber
enriched
the
tissues
variegating
them
with
a
variety
of
harmonious
pallors
like
music
darker
in
the
depressions
of
the
loins
and
where
the
loins
join
the
sides
lighter
on
the
breast
and
on
the
groins
where
the
epidermis
makes
its
most
exquisite
suavity
george
thought
of
othello
s
words
i
had
rather
be
a
toad
and
live
upon
the
vapour
of
a
dungeon
than
keep
a
corner
in
the
thing
i
love
for
others
uses
in
her
slumber
hippolyte
made
a
movement
with
a
vague
air
of
suffering
which
disappeared
immediately
she
threw
back
her
head
on
the
pillow
exposing
her
extended
breast
on
which
was
defined
the
light
network
of
the
veins
her
lower
jaws
were
rather
powerful
the
chin
rather
long
in
profile
the
nostrils
broad
in
the
abstract
the
defects
of
her
head
were
accentuated
but
they
did
not
displease
george
because
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
imagine
that
they
could
be
corrected
without
removing
from
the
physiognomy
an
element
of
living
expression
the
expression
that
immaterial
thing
which
irradiates
all
matter
that
changing
and
immeasurable
force
which
invades
the
corporeal
face
and
transfigures
it
that
significative
external
which
superposes
a
symbolic
beauty
of
an
order
far
more
elevated
and
complex
on
the
precise
reality
of
the
was
hippolyte
sanzio
s
great
charm
because
it
offered
to
the
passionate
thinker
a
continual
motive
of
emotions
and
dreams
such
a
woman
he
thought
has
belonged
to
others
before
being
mine
she
has
shared
the
couch
of
another
man
she
has
slept
with
another
man
in
the
same
bed
on
the
same
pillow
in
all
women
there
exists
a
sort
of
extraordinarily
active
physical
memory
the
memory
of
sensations
does
she
remember
the
sensations
which
she
received
from
that
man
can
she
have
forgotten
him
who
was
the
first
and
who
violated
her
what
were
her
feelings
beneath
her
husband
s
caress
at
these
questions
which
he
repeated
to
himself
for
the
thousandth
time
a
anguish
oppressed
his
heart
oh
why
can
we
not
put
to
death
the
creature
we
love
and
resuscitate
her
afterwards
with
a
virgin
body
with
a
new
soul
he
recalled
certain
words
which
hippolyte
had
said
in
an
hour
of
supreme
intoxication
you
are
embracing
a
virgin
i
have
never
known
in
love
hippolyte
was
married
the
spring
preceding
that
of
their
love
a
few
weeks
after
the
wedding
she
had
begun
to
suffer
from
a
slow
and
cruel
malady
which
had
confined
her
to
bed
and
kept
her
for
a
long
time
between
life
and
death
but
happily
this
malady
had
spared
her
all
new
contact
with
the
odious
man
who
had
seized
her
like
an
inert
prey
when
she
emerged
from
her
long
convalescence
she
gave
herself
up
to
passion
as
in
a
dream
suddenly
blindly
passionately
she
abandoned
herself
to
the
young
stranger
whose
soft
and
curious
voice
had
addressed
to
her
words
she
had
never
heard
before
and
she
had
not
lied
when
saying
to
him
you
are
embracing
a
virgin
i
have
never
known
any
voluptuousness
since
then
what
a
profound
change
in
this
woman
something
new
indefinable
yet
real
had
entered
into
her
voice
into
her
gestures
into
her
eyes
into
her
slightest
tones
into
her
slightest
movements
into
the
slightest
external
signs
george
had
been
present
at
the
most
intoxicating
spectacle
of
which
an
intellectual
lover
can
dream
he
had
seen
the
loved
woman
become
metamorphosed
after
his
own
image
borrow
his
thoughts
his
judgments
his
tastes
his
disdains
his
predilections
his
melancholies
all
that
which
gives
a
special
imprint
and
character
to
the
mind
in
speaking
hippolyte
used
the
forms
of
speech
he
preferred
pronounced
certain
words
with
the
inflexion
peculiar
to
him
in
writing
she
imitated
even
his
hand
never
had
the
influence
of
one
being
on
another
been
so
rapid
and
so
strong
hippolyte
had
merited
the
device
which
george
had
given
her
dum
but
this
grave
and
suave
creature
she
in
whom
he
had
succeeded
in
inculcating
with
so
much
art
the
disdain
for
a
commonplace
existence
among
what
humiliating
contacts
had
she
spent
the
distant
hours
george
thought
again
of
his
anguish
of
long
ago
when
he
saw
her
go
away
return
beneath
the
conjugal
roof
into
the
house
of
a
man
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
into
a
world
of
which
he
knew
nothing
into
the
platitudes
and
the
pettiness
of
the
life
in
which
she
was
born
and
in
which
she
had
grown
like
a
rare
plant
in
a
common
had
she
at
that
time
never
hidden
anything
from
him
had
she
never
lied
to
him
had
she
always
been
able
to
withdraw
from
her
husband
s
importunities
on
the
pretext
that
her
cure
was
not
yet
complete
always
george
remembered
the
horrible
pang
he
felt
one
day
when
she
came
late
panting
her
cheeks
more
colored
and
warmer
than
usual
with
a
persistent
odor
of
tobacco
in
her
hair
that
bad
odor
which
impregnates
him
who
remains
a
long
time
in
a
room
where
there
are
many
smokers
pardon
me
if
i
am
late
she
had
said
to
him
but
i
had
several
of
my
husband
s
friends
to
dinner
and
they
kept
me
until
now
and
these
words
had
suggested
to
him
the
vision
of
a
around
which
the
boors
exhibited
their
brutality
george
recalled
a
thousand
similar
little
details
and
an
infinity
of
other
cruel
sufferings
and
also
recent
sufferings
caused
by
hippolyte
s
new
stay
at
her
mother
s
in
a
house
not
less
unknown
and
not
less
free
from
suspicion
at
last
here
she
is
now
with
me
every
day
every
minute
continually
i
shall
see
her
i
shall
enjoy
her
i
will
see
that
her
thoughts
are
occupied
continually
with
me
my
thoughts
my
dreams
my
sorrows
i
will
consecrate
to
her
every
instant
uninterruptedly
i
will
invent
a
thousand
new
ways
of
pleasing
her
of
agitating
her
of
making
her
sad
of
exalting
her
i
will
so
penetrate
her
with
my
being
that
she
will
end
by
believing
me
to
be
an
essential
element
of
her
own
life
he
bent
over
her
softly
he
kissed
her
softly
on
the
shoulder
near
the
arm
on
that
little
rounded
eminence
of
exquisite
form
and
color
whose
skin
had
the
softness
of
velvet
fine
enough
as
to
seem
almost
impalpable
he
respired
the
perfume
of
this
woman
so
subtle
and
sweet
that
cutaneous
perfume
which
during
the
instant
of
pleasure
became
as
intoxicating
as
that
of
tuberoses
and
gave
a
terrible
lash
to
desire
watching
thus
closely
the
sleep
of
this
delicate
and
complicated
creature
whom
slumber
enveloped
in
a
mystery
that
strange
creature
who
from
every
pore
seemed
to
irradiate
towards
him
some
occult
fascination
of
unbelievable
intensity
he
remarked
once
more
in
his
inner
self
a
vague
movement
of
instinctive
terror
again
hippolyte
changed
her
position
without
awakening
but
with
a
faint
moan
she
turned
on
her
back
a
light
perspiration
imparted
a
dampness
to
her
temples
through
her
mouth
the
breathing
respired
came
more
rapidly
rather
irregularly
at
moments
her
eyebrows
contracted
she
was
dreaming
of
what
was
she
dreaming
george
seized
by
an
inquietude
which
soon
increased
to
an
insane
anxiety
set
himself
to
detect
upon
her
face
the
slightest
indications
in
the
hope
of
surprising
there
some
revealing
sign
revealing
what
he
was
incapable
of
reflecting
incapable
of
repressing
the
furious
tumults
of
fears
doubts
and
suspicions
in
her
slumber
hippolyte
started
her
entire
body
was
convulsed
as
if
racked
by
nightmare
she
turned
over
on
her
side
towards
george
she
groaned
and
cried
no
no
then
she
drew
two
or
three
breaths
almost
like
sobs
and
started
again
a
prey
to
insane
fear
george
watched
her
fixedly
his
ear
to
hear
other
words
another
s
name
the
name
of
a
man
he
waited
in
horrible
uncertainty
as
if
under
the
menace
of
a
thunderbolt
which
could
destroy
him
in
a
second
hippolyte
awoke
she
saw
him
confusedly
without
thinking
still
sleeping
she
nestled
close
up
to
him
with
an
almost
unconscious
movement
of
what
were
you
dreaming
he
asked
her
in
a
changed
voice
which
seemed
to
reverberate
his
i
do
not
know
she
answered
languid
still
drowsy
leaning
her
cheek
on
her
lover
s
breast
i
don
t
remember
she
fell
asleep
again
under
the
soft
pressure
of
her
cheek
george
remained
motionless
with
a
dull
rancor
at
the
bottom
of
his
soul
he
felt
himself
a
stranger
to
her
isolated
from
her
uselessly
curious
all
his
bitter
recollections
came
back
to
him
in
a
tumult
he
lived
over
again
in
a
single
instant
his
miseries
of
two
years
he
could
oppose
nothing
to
the
immense
doubts
which
crushed
his
soul
and
made
the
head
of
his
loved
one
seem
as
heavy
as
a
rock
suddenly
hippolyte
started
a
second
time
moaned
twisted
cried
again
and
she
opened
her
eyes
frightened
groaning
oh
my
god
what
ails
you
of
what
were
you
dreaming
i
do
not
know
her
face
was
contracted
convulsively
she
added
you
must
have
been
leaning
on
me
i
thought
you
were
pushing
me
hurting
me
she
suffered
visibly
oh
my
god
my
pains
have
come
back
since
her
illness
she
sometimes
had
short
attacks
spasms
that
quickly
passed
but
whose
passage
forced
from
her
a
groan
or
cry
she
turned
towards
george
looked
fixedly
into
his
eyes
and
found
there
the
traces
of
the
tempest
and
in
a
coaxing
reproachful
tone
she
repeated
you
did
so
hurt
me
all
at
once
george
seized
her
in
his
arms
clasped
her
passionately
to
his
breast
and
smothered
her
under
his
kisses
ix
as
the
air
was
of
an
almost
warmth
george
proposed
shall
we
dine
outside
hippolyte
consented
they
went
down
on
the
stairway
they
held
each
other
s
hand
and
went
down
step
by
step
slowly
stopping
to
look
at
the
crushed
flowers
turning
round
towards
each
other
simultaneously
as
if
they
saw
each
other
for
the
first
time
each
saw
in
the
other
eyes
larger
more
profound
as
if
more
distant
and
circled
by
an
almost
supernatural
shadow
they
smiled
at
each
other
without
speaking
both
dominated
by
the
charm
of
that
indefinable
sensation
which
seemed
to
disperse
into
the
uncertainty
of
space
the
substance
of
their
being
transformed
into
a
fluid
like
a
vapor
they
walked
towards
the
parapet
they
stopped
to
look
around
to
listen
to
the
sea
what
they
saw
was
unusual
extraordinarily
great
yet
illumined
by
an
inner
light
and
as
if
by
an
irradiation
of
their
hearts
what
they
heard
was
unusual
extraordinarily
high
yet
contemplated
as
if
a
secret
revealed
to
them
alone
a
second
as
quickly
passed
they
were
recalled
to
themselves
not
by
a
gust
of
the
wind
nor
by
the
noise
of
a
wave
nor
by
a
bellowing
nor
by
a
bark
nor
by
a
human
voice
but
by
the
very
anxiety
which
arose
from
their
too
intense
joy
a
second
as
quickly
passed
irrevocable
and
both
recommenced
to
feel
that
life
was
slipping
by
that
time
was
flying
that
everything
was
becoming
once
more
foreign
to
their
being
that
their
souls
were
becoming
anxious
again
and
their
love
imperfect
this
second
of
supreme
oblivion
this
unique
second
was
gone
forever
hippolyte
moved
by
the
solemnity
of
the
solitude
oppressed
by
a
vague
fright
in
the
presence
of
those
vast
waters
beneath
that
desert
sky
which
from
the
zenith
to
the
horizon
paled
by
slow
gradations
murmured
what
endless
space
it
seemed
now
to
both
that
the
point
of
space
in
which
they
breathed
was
infinitely
distant
from
the
frequented
spots
out
of
the
way
isolated
unknown
inaccessible
almost
outside
of
the
world
now
they
saw
the
wish
of
their
hearts
realized
they
both
felt
the
same
inward
terror
as
if
they
foresaw
their
impotence
to
sustain
the
plenitude
of
the
new
life
for
a
few
instants
longer
silent
standing
side
by
side
but
apart
they
continued
to
contemplate
the
melancholy
and
icy
adriatic
whose
great
waves
sported
in
endless
playfulness
from
time
to
time
a
stiff
breeze
swept
through
the
tufts
of
the
acacias
bearing
off
their
perfume
of
what
are
you
thinking
asked
george
drawing
himself
up
as
if
to
rebel
against
the
importunate
sadness
which
was
about
to
conquer
him
he
was
there
alone
with
his
mistress
living
and
free
and
nevertheless
his
heart
was
not
satisfied
did
he
then
bear
in
himself
an
inconsolable
hopelessness
feeling
anew
a
separation
between
the
silent
creature
and
himself
he
took
her
again
by
the
hand
and
gazed
into
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
of
what
are
you
thinking
i
am
thinking
of
rimini
answered
hippolyte
with
a
smile
always
the
past
she
remembers
bygone
days
at
such
a
moment
was
it
the
same
sea
which
lay
extended
before
their
eyes
veiled
in
the
same
illusion
his
first
motion
was
one
of
hostility
against
the
unconscious
evocatrice
then
as
if
in
a
lightning
flash
with
sudden
uneasiness
he
saw
all
the
summits
of
his
love
light
up
and
scintillate
in
the
past
prodigiously
things
came
back
to
his
memory
accompanied
by
waves
of
music
which
exalted
and
transfigured
them
he
lived
again
in
one
second
the
most
lyric
hours
of
his
passion
and
he
lived
them
again
in
propitious
places
among
the
sumptuous
scenery
of
nature
and
art
which
had
rendered
his
joy
nobler
and
more
profound
why
then
now
in
comparison
with
that
past
had
the
moment
just
previous
lost
part
of
its
charm
in
his
eyes
dazzled
by
the
rapid
gleam
of
his
recollections
everything
now
seemed
colorless
and
he
perceived
that
the
progressive
diminution
of
the
light
caused
him
a
kind
of
indefinable
corporeal
uneasiness
as
if
this
external
phenomenon
were
in
immediate
correspondence
with
some
element
of
his
own
life
he
sought
some
phrase
that
would
bring
hippolyte
closer
to
him
to
attach
her
to
him
by
some
sensitive
tie
to
restore
to
himself
of
the
present
reality
the
exact
feeling
which
he
had
just
lost
but
this
search
was
painful
to
him
the
ideas
escaped
him
dispersed
left
him
void
as
he
had
heard
a
rattle
of
plates
he
asked
are
you
hungry
this
question
suggested
by
a
slight
material
fact
and
propounded
unexpectedly
with
puerile
vivacity
made
hippolyte
smile
yes
a
little
she
answered
smiling
and
they
turned
round
to
look
at
the
table
spread
beneath
the
oak
in
a
few
minutes
the
dinner
would
be
ready
you
must
be
satisfied
with
what
there
is
said
george
very
countrified
cooking
oh
i
should
be
very
well
satisfied
with
grass
and
gayly
she
approached
the
table
examined
with
curiosity
the
cloth
the
knives
and
forks
the
glassware
the
plates
found
everything
pretty
rejoiced
like
a
child
at
the
sight
of
the
large
flowers
which
decorated
the
white
and
fine
porcelain
everything
here
pleases
me
she
said
she
bent
over
a
large
round
loaf
of
bread
yet
warm
beneath
its
beautiful
browned
and
rounded
crust
she
breathed
in
the
odor
with
delight
oh
what
a
delightful
odor
and
with
childish
greediness
she
broke
off
the
crusty
edge
of
the
loaf
what
fine
bread
her
white
and
strong
teeth
shone
in
the
bitten
bread
the
play
of
her
sinuous
mouth
expressed
vigorously
the
pleasure
enjoyed
in
this
act
her
whole
person
shed
a
pure
and
simple
grace
which
seduced
and
surprised
george
as
if
it
were
an
unexpected
novelty
here
taste
how
good
it
is
and
she
handed
him
the
piece
of
bread
on
which
was
imprinted
the
humid
trace
of
her
bite
and
she
pushed
it
between
his
lips
laughing
imparting
the
sensual
contagion
of
her
hilarity
just
see
he
found
the
taste
delicious
and
he
abandoned
himself
to
this
fugitive
enchantment
permitted
himself
to
be
enveloped
by
this
seduction
which
seemed
a
novelty
a
mad
longing
suddenly
seized
him
to
embrace
the
temptress
to
lift
her
in
his
arms
to
carry
her
off
like
a
prey
his
heart
swelled
with
a
confused
aspiration
towards
physical
force
towards
robust
health
towards
an
almost
savage
life
of
joy
towards
simple
and
primitive
love
towards
the
great
primordial
liberty
he
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
rend
the
mortal
frame
which
oppressed
him
to
leave
it
and
be
entirely
renewed
indemnified
for
all
the
woes
he
had
suffered
for
all
the
deformity
which
had
hindered
his
flight
he
had
the
hallucination
of
a
future
existence
which
would
be
his
and
in
which
freed
from
every
harmful
habit
from
every
foreign
tyranny
from
every
bad
error
he
would
look
at
things
as
if
he
saw
them
for
the
first
time
and
had
before
him
all
the
surface
of
the
world
exposed
like
a
human
visage
was
it
then
impossible
that
the
miracle
should
come
from
this
young
woman
who
at
the
stone
table
beneath
the
protecting
oak
had
broken
the
new
bread
and
shared
it
with
him
could
not
the
new
life
really
commence
from
new
life
i
over
the
adriatic
swept
the
humid
and
oppressive
heat
of
the
east
wind
the
sky
was
cloudy
nebulous
white
as
milk
the
sea
having
lost
all
motion
and
all
materiality
seemed
mingled
with
the
diffused
vapors
in
the
white
without
respiration
a
white
sail
a
single
white
rare
a
thing
in
the
visible
yonder
near
the
diomede
islands
motionless
indefinitely
lengthened
by
the
reflection
of
the
water
the
visible
centre
of
this
inert
world
which
gradually
seemed
to
evaporate
seated
in
a
tired
attitude
on
the
parapet
of
the
loggia
hippolyte
fixed
her
gaze
on
the
sail
her
eyes
magnetized
by
its
whiteness
a
little
bent
her
whole
figure
relaxed
she
had
an
air
of
stupor
almost
of
hebetude
which
revealed
the
momentary
eclipse
of
her
inner
life
and
this
absence
of
expressive
energy
accentuated
all
that
there
was
commonplace
and
irregular
in
her
features
rendered
heavier
the
lower
part
of
her
face
even
the
elastic
and
sinuous
contact
had
so
often
communicated
to
george
a
sort
of
instinctive
and
indefinable
terror
seemed
now
despoiled
of
its
bewitching
charm
and
reduced
to
the
physical
appearance
of
a
vulgar
organ
which
only
recalled
kisses
as
a
mechanical
art
deprived
of
all
beauty
george
considered
with
attention
and
the
naked
reality
of
this
unconscious
woman
with
whose
life
he
had
up
to
now
so
furiously
joined
his
own
life
and
he
thought
in
an
instant
all
has
ended
the
flame
is
extinguished
i
love
her
no
longer
how
has
that
happened
so
quickly
what
he
felt
was
not
only
the
disgust
following
abuse
that
carnal
aversion
which
follows
prolonged
pleasures
but
a
more
profound
detachment
which
seemed
to
him
definite
and
irremediable
how
could
anyone
still
love
after
having
seen
what
i
see
the
usual
phenomenon
took
place
in
him
with
its
first
perceptions
real
isolated
and
exaggerated
he
composed
by
association
an
inner
phantom
which
gave
to
his
nerves
a
much
stronger
impulse
than
the
present
object
henceforth
what
he
saw
in
hippolyte
s
person
with
inconceivable
intensity
was
the
sexual
being
exclusively
the
inferior
being
deprived
of
all
spiritual
value
a
simple
instrument
of
pleasure
and
of
luxury
the
instrument
of
ruin
and
of
death
and
he
had
a
horror
of
his
father
but
after
all
was
he
not
doing
the
same
thing
and
the
recollection
of
the
concubine
crossed
his
mind
he
found
in
his
memory
certain
details
of
the
horrible
altercation
with
that
odious
man
in
the
country
house
in
front
of
the
open
window
through
which
he
had
heard
the
cries
of
the
little
bastards
in
front
of
the
large
table
littered
with
papers
on
which
he
had
perceived
the
disk
of
glass
and
the
obscene
vignette
how
heavy
the
air
is
murmured
hippolyte
removing
her
gaze
from
the
white
sail
which
still
remained
motionless
in
the
infinite
does
it
not
oppress
you
too
she
rose
took
a
few
listless
steps
towards
a
willow
seat
provided
with
cushions
and
sank
down
as
if
dead
with
fatigue
sighing
deeply
throwing
back
her
head
her
eyes
the
curved
lids
of
which
trembled
she
had
suddenly
become
very
beautiful
again
her
beauty
was
rekindled
unexpectedly
like
a
torch
when
will
the
mistral
blow
look
at
that
sail
it
is
always
in
the
same
place
it
s
the
first
white
sail
since
my
arrival
it
seems
as
if
i
dream
it
is
there
as
george
remained
silent
she
added
have
you
seen
any
others
no
it
s
the
first
i
have
seen
too
from
where
did
it
come
from
gargano
perhaps
and
where
is
it
going
perhaps
to
ortona
what
is
her
cargo
perhaps
oranges
she
began
to
laugh
and
even
her
laugh
enveloping
her
as
if
in
a
live
wave
of
freshness
transfigured
her
anew
look
look
she
cried
raising
herself
on
one
elbow
and
pointing
to
the
horizon
of
the
sea
where
it
appeared
as
if
a
curtain
had
fallen
five
other
sails
over
there
in
file
do
you
see
them
yes
i
see
them
there
are
five
yes
five
more
more
over
there
look
another
file
what
a
number
there
are
the
sails
appeared
at
the
extreme
limit
of
the
sea
red
like
little
flames
motionless
the
wind
is
changing
i
feel
that
the
wind
is
changing
look
there
how
the
water
is
beginning
to
ripple
a
sudden
breeze
assailed
the
tufts
of
the
acacias
which
bending
on
their
stems
shed
several
blossoms
like
dead
butterflies
then
before
those
light
remains
could
touch
the
earth
all
was
at
peace
again
during
the
interval
of
silence
the
low
murmur
of
the
water
as
it
was
dashed
against
the
beach
could
be
heard
and
this
murmur
died
away
with
the
flight
of
the
wave
as
it
passed
along
the
shore
and
then
ceased
did
you
hear
it
she
had
risen
and
leaned
on
the
parapet
listening
intently
in
the
attitude
of
a
musician
who
is
tuning
his
instrument
here
is
the
wave
coming
back
she
cried
again
pointing
to
the
mobile
rippling
of
the
water
upon
which
the
shower
was
advancing
and
she
waited
animated
by
impatience
ready
to
fill
her
lungs
with
the
wind
after
a
few
seconds
the
acacias
assailed
once
more
bent
on
their
stems
causing
a
shower
of
other
flowers
and
the
strong
gust
bore
as
far
as
the
loggia
the
saline
odor
mingled
with
the
perfume
of
the
withered
bunches
a
silvery
sound
of
singular
harmony
filled
with
its
kettledrum
vibrations
the
concavity
of
the
little
bay
between
the
two
promontories
do
you
hear
said
hippolyte
in
a
low
but
exulting
voice
as
if
this
music
had
penetrated
as
far
as
her
soul
and
that
all
her
life
were
participating
in
the
vicissitudes
of
the
things
around
her
george
followed
all
her
actions
all
her
gestures
all
her
movements
every
word
with
such
intense
attention
that
the
rest
was
for
him
as
if
it
had
never
existed
the
preceding
image
no
longer
coincided
with
the
actual
appearance
though
it
still
dominated
his
mind
to
the
extent
of
maintaining
the
profound
sensation
of
the
moral
detachment
and
of
preventing
him
from
replacing
this
woman
in
her
first
frame
of
not
reëstablishing
her
in
her
original
state
of
being
of
not
reintegrating
her
but
from
every
one
of
these
actions
from
every
one
of
these
gestures
from
every
one
of
these
movements
from
every
one
of
these
words
emanated
an
inevitable
power
all
these
physical
manifestations
seemed
to
compose
a
web
which
trapped
him
and
held
him
prisoner
it
seemed
that
between
this
woman
and
himself
there
was
formed
a
sort
of
corporeal
bond
a
sort
of
organic
dependence
a
correspondence
by
virtue
of
which
the
slightest
gesture
provoked
in
him
an
involuntary
sensual
modification
and
that
henceforth
he
would
no
longer
be
capable
of
living
and
feeling
independently
how
could
he
reconcile
this
evident
affinity
with
the
occult
hate
which
he
had
just
discovered
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
hippolyte
through
a
spontaneous
curiosity
through
an
instinctive
desire
to
multiply
her
sensations
and
to
make
the
surrounding
neighborhood
part
of
herself
was
still
absorbed
in
the
spectacle
the
facility
she
exhibited
in
entering
into
communication
with
every
form
of
natural
life
and
of
finding
a
world
of
analogies
between
human
expressions
and
the
appearances
of
the
most
diverse
things
this
rapid
and
diffuse
sympathy
which
attached
her
not
only
to
objects
with
which
she
was
in
daily
contact
but
also
to
foreign
objects
that
sort
of
imitative
virtue
which
often
permitted
her
to
express
by
a
single
sign
the
distinctive
character
of
an
animate
or
inanimate
being
of
talking
to
the
domestic
animals
and
understanding
their
these
mimic
faculties
properly
concurred
in
rendering
more
visible
in
george
s
eyes
the
predominance
in
her
of
the
inferior
life
what
s
that
she
said
surprised
at
noticing
a
sudden
mysterious
rumbling
didn
t
you
hear
it
it
was
like
a
dull
blow
which
other
blows
followed
in
rapid
so
strange
that
it
could
not
be
discerned
if
they
came
from
near
or
far
in
the
air
that
became
more
and
more
limpid
didn
t
you
hear
that
it
may
be
distant
thunder
oh
no
what
then
they
looked
around
them
perplexed
every
moment
the
sea
was
changing
color
in
proportion
as
the
sky
became
clearer
here
and
there
it
took
on
that
shade
of
indefinable
green
like
unripe
flax
as
when
the
sun
s
oblique
rays
pass
through
the
diaphanous
stems
in
an
april
twilight
ah
it
s
the
sail
white
sail
yonder
cried
hippolyte
happy
at
being
the
first
to
discover
the
mystery
look
she
s
caught
the
wind
she
s
off
ii
with
a
few
intervals
of
drowsy
indolence
she
felt
a
mad
desire
to
wander
off
to
venture
out
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
to
scour
the
beach
and
surrounding
country
to
explore
unfamiliar
paths
she
stimulated
her
companion
at
times
she
carried
him
off
almost
by
force
at
times
too
she
started
off
alone
and
he
joined
her
unexpectedly
in
order
to
climb
a
hill
they
followed
a
small
pathway
bordered
by
thick
hedges
of
violet
flowers
among
which
blossomed
the
large
and
delicate
calices
of
other
snowy
fragrant
flowers
with
fine
petals
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedges
ears
of
corn
waved
to
and
fro
on
their
stems
in
color
more
or
less
ready
to
change
into
gold
and
in
other
places
the
corn
was
so
thick
and
high
that
it
towered
over
the
tops
of
the
hedges
suggesting
a
beautiful
overflowing
cup
nothing
escaped
hippolyte
s
vigilant
eye
every
minute
she
stooped
to
blow
away
certain
spheres
of
down
very
fragile
at
the
tips
of
their
long
slender
peduncles
every
minute
she
stopped
to
observe
the
small
spiders
climbing
by
an
invisible
thread
from
a
flower
situated
low
down
to
a
branch
above
on
the
hill
in
a
narrow
sunny
circle
there
was
a
small
field
of
flax
already
dry
the
yellowish
stems
bore
at
their
summits
a
ball
of
gold
and
here
and
there
the
gold
seemed
tarnished
by
an
ironlike
rust
the
highest
stems
were
waving
almost
imperceptibly
and
because
of
this
extreme
lightness
the
whole
gave
the
idea
of
some
delicate
piece
of
look
it
is
just
like
filigree
said
hippolyte
the
furze
was
commencing
to
shed
its
flowers
a
few
feet
away
hung
a
sort
of
white
foam
in
flakes
on
others
crawled
large
black
and
brown
caterpillars
soft
to
the
touch
as
velvet
hippolyte
took
up
one
whose
delicate
down
was
streaked
with
vermilion
and
she
kept
it
calmly
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
it
is
more
beautiful
than
a
flower
she
said
george
remarked
and
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
was
almost
totally
devoid
of
instinctive
repugnance
towards
insects
and
that
in
general
she
did
not
feel
that
keen
and
invincible
repulsion
which
he
himself
felt
for
a
host
of
things
considered
unclean
throw
it
away
i
beg
of
you
she
began
to
laugh
and
stretched
out
her
hand
as
if
to
put
the
caterpillar
on
his
neck
he
gave
a
cry
and
sprang
back
which
made
her
laugh
all
the
more
oh
what
a
brave
man
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
she
started
to
pursue
him
between
the
trunks
of
the
young
oaks
through
the
narrow
paths
that
formed
a
sort
of
mountainous
labyrinth
her
peals
of
laughter
started
from
between
the
gray
stones
flocks
of
wild
sparrows
stop
stop
you
frighten
the
sheep
a
small
flock
of
frightened
sheep
dispersed
dragging
behind
them
up
the
rocky
incline
a
bundle
of
bluish
rags
stop
i
have
it
no
longer
see
and
she
showed
the
runaway
her
empty
hands
let
us
help
the
mute
and
she
ran
towards
the
woman
in
rags
who
was
making
ineffectual
efforts
to
hold
back
the
sheep
attached
to
the
long
cords
of
twisted
osier
hippolyte
seized
the
bunch
of
cords
and
braced
her
feet
against
a
stone
in
order
to
have
more
resisting
power
she
panted
her
face
purple
and
in
this
violent
attitude
she
was
very
beautiful
her
beauty
lighted
up
unexpectedly
like
a
torch
come
george
come
you
too
she
cried
to
george
communicating
to
him
her
frank
and
childish
joy
the
sheep
stopped
in
a
clump
of
furze
there
were
six
of
them
three
black
and
three
white
and
bore
the
osier
cords
around
their
woolly
necks
the
woman
who
looked
after
them
emaciated
poorly
covered
by
her
bluish
rags
gesticulated
while
giving
vent
from
her
toothless
mouth
to
an
incomprehensible
grumbling
her
little
greenish
eyes
without
eyelashes
bleary
tearful
and
congested
had
a
malignant
look
when
hippolyte
gave
her
alms
she
kissed
the
pieces
of
money
then
letting
go
the
cords
she
removed
from
her
head
a
rag
which
no
longer
had
either
form
or
color
stooped
to
the
ground
and
slowly
with
greatest
care
tied
up
the
pieces
of
money
in
a
multiplicity
of
knots
i
am
tired
said
hippolyte
let
us
sit
down
here
for
a
moment
they
sat
down
george
then
perceived
that
the
spot
was
near
the
great
furze
field
where
on
that
may
morning
the
five
virgins
had
plucked
the
flowers
to
strew
the
path
of
the
beautiful
roman
that
morning
already
seemed
very
far
off
lost
in
dreamy
haze
he
said
do
you
see
over
yonder
those
bushes
which
are
now
almost
flowerless
well
it
was
there
that
we
filled
the
baskets
to
strew
flowers
on
your
path
when
you
arrived
oh
what
a
day
do
you
remember
she
smiled
and
in
a
transport
of
sudden
tenderness
took
one
of
his
hands
which
she
kept
pressed
in
her
own
and
she
leaned
her
cheek
on
the
shoulder
of
the
loved
one
burying
herself
in
the
sweetness
of
that
memory
of
that
solitude
of
that
peace
of
that
poesy
from
time
to
time
a
breath
of
wind
passed
through
the
tops
of
the
oaks
and
below
farther
on
in
the
gray
of
the
passed
from
time
to
time
a
clear
wave
of
silver
the
mute
moved
away
slowly
behind
the
feeding
sheep
and
she
seemed
to
leave
something
fantastic
in
her
traces
as
if
a
reflect
of
the
legends
in
which
malignant
fairies
transform
themselves
into
toads
at
every
turn
of
the
path
aren
t
you
happy
now
murmured
hippolyte
george
thought
it
is
already
two
weeks
and
there
has
been
no
change
in
me
still
the
same
anxiety
the
same
inquietude
the
same
discontent
we
are
hardly
at
the
beginning
and
i
already
foresee
the
end
what
shall
we
do
to
enjoy
the
passing
hour
certain
phrases
of
a
letter
from
hippolyte
recurred
to
him
oh
when
will
it
be
given
me
to
be
near
you
during
entire
days
to
live
your
life
you
will
see
i
shall
no
longer
be
the
same
woman
i
will
be
your
mistress
your
friend
your
sister
and
if
you
think
me
worthy
i
will
be
also
your
adviser
in
me
you
should
find
nothing
but
sweetness
and
repose
it
will
be
a
life
of
love
such
as
has
never
before
been
seen
he
thought
for
the
past
two
weeks
our
whole
existence
has
been
composed
of
petty
material
incidents
like
those
of
it
is
true
i
have
already
seen
in
her
she
is
commencing
to
change
even
in
appearance
it
is
unbelievable
how
rapidly
she
is
gaining
in
health
one
would
say
that
every
breath
is
a
gain
that
for
her
every
fruit
turns
into
blood
that
the
healthfulness
of
the
air
penetrates
her
every
pore
she
was
made
for
this
life
of
idleness
of
liberty
of
physical
enjoyment
of
carelessness
up
to
now
she
has
not
uttered
a
single
thoughtful
word
which
revealed
preoccupation
of
the
soul
her
intervals
of
silence
and
immobility
are
caused
only
by
muscular
fatigue
just
as
at
the
present
moment
of
what
are
you
thinking
she
demanded
of
nothing
i
am
happy
after
a
pause
she
added
we
ll
go
on
now
shall
we
they
rose
she
bestowed
upon
his
mouth
a
sonorous
kiss
she
was
gay
and
restless
every
few
minutes
she
darted
away
from
him
to
run
down
an
incline
free
from
rocks
and
when
she
wished
to
check
her
speed
she
grasped
the
trunk
of
a
young
oak
which
groaned
and
bent
beneath
the
shock
she
gathered
a
violet
flower
and
sucked
it
it
s
honey
she
gathered
another
and
placed
it
on
her
lover
s
lips
taste
it
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
enjoyed
the
savor
for
the
second
time
at
seeing
the
motions
of
his
mouth
with
all
these
flowers
and
all
these
bees
there
must
certainly
be
a
hive
near
by
she
went
on
one
of
these
mornings
while
you
are
asleep
i
must
come
here
and
search
for
it
i
ll
bring
you
a
honeycomb
she
prattled
at
a
great
rate
about
this
adventure
which
tickled
her
fancy
and
in
her
words
appeared
with
the
vivacity
of
an
actual
sensation
the
freshness
of
the
morning
the
mystery
of
the
woods
the
impatience
of
the
search
the
joy
of
the
discovery
the
pale
color
and
wild
fragrance
of
honey
they
halted
up
the
hill
at
the
border
of
the
woody
region
charmed
by
the
melancholy
which
ascended
from
the
sea
the
sea
was
delicately
colored
between
a
blue
and
a
green
in
which
the
green
had
a
progressive
tendency
to
dominate
but
the
sky
of
a
leaden
azure
at
the
zenith
and
streaked
here
and
there
by
clouds
was
in
the
curve
toward
ortono
this
light
was
reflected
in
pale
tints
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
recalled
deflowered
roses
floating
against
the
maritime
background
were
arranged
in
steps
in
harmonious
degrees
first
the
two
large
oaks
with
their
dark
foliage
then
the
silvery
then
the
with
their
bright
foliage
and
violet
branches
the
moon
enormous
almost
at
its
full
rose
up
above
the
ring
of
the
horizon
like
a
globe
of
crystal
through
whose
transparency
could
be
seen
a
chimerical
country
figured
in
on
a
massive
disk
of
gold
one
heard
the
warbling
of
birds
near
and
far
one
heard
the
lowing
of
an
ox
then
a
bleating
then
the
wailing
of
a
child
there
was
a
pause
during
which
all
these
voices
were
silent
and
only
this
single
wail
was
heard
it
was
a
wail
not
violent
or
interrupted
but
shrill
continuous
almost
feeble
and
it
attracted
the
soul
detached
it
from
all
the
rest
snatched
it
from
the
seduction
of
the
twilight
to
oppress
it
with
a
veritable
anguish
which
responded
to
the
suffering
of
the
unknown
creature
of
the
little
invisible
being
do
you
hear
said
hippolyte
whose
voice
already
changed
by
compassion
became
involuntarily
lower
i
know
who
the
child
is
that
s
crying
you
know
asked
george
to
whom
his
mistress
s
voice
and
appearance
had
given
a
strange
shock
yes
she
was
again
listening
intently
to
the
lamentable
moaning
which
now
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
place
she
added
it
s
the
infant
that
the
ghouls
are
sucking
she
had
pronounced
these
words
without
the
shadow
of
a
smile
as
if
she
herself
were
beneath
the
empire
of
the
superstition
it
lives
over
there
in
that
cottage
candia
told
me
after
a
slight
hesitation
during
which
they
listened
to
the
wails
and
had
a
fantastic
vision
of
the
dying
child
hippolyte
suggested
shall
we
go
and
see
it
it
s
not
far
george
was
perplexed
dreading
the
sadness
of
the
spectacle
and
the
contact
of
the
distressed
and
coarse
people
shall
we
repeated
hippolyte
whose
curiosity
became
irresistible
it
is
over
there
in
that
old
cottage
beneath
the
pine
i
know
the
way
let
s
go
she
went
straight
ahead
hastening
her
steps
across
a
sloping
field
both
were
silent
both
heard
only
the
infantile
wail
which
served
them
as
a
guide
and
step
by
step
their
anguish
became
more
poignant
and
in
proportion
as
the
wailing
became
more
distinct
and
indicated
better
the
poor
bloodless
body
from
which
pain
forced
it
they
traversed
a
copse
of
odorous
treading
on
the
flowers
scattered
on
the
ground
on
the
threshold
of
a
cottage
close
to
the
one
they
sought
an
enormously
stout
woman
was
seated
and
on
her
monstrous
body
was
a
small
round
head
with
soft
eyes
white
teeth
a
placid
smile
where
are
you
going
signora
asked
the
woman
without
rising
we
are
going
to
see
the
child
whom
the
ghouls
are
sucking
what
s
the
use
you
d
better
stay
here
and
take
a
rest
i
do
not
lack
children
either
look
three
or
four
naked
children
who
had
also
such
large
stomachs
that
one
would
have
believed
them
to
be
dropsical
dragged
themselves
along
on
the
ground
grunting
and
tumbling
over
putting
in
their
mouths
everything
that
fell
into
their
hands
and
the
woman
held
in
her
arms
a
fifth
child
all
covered
with
brownish
scabs
from
the
midst
of
which
shone
out
a
pair
of
large
clear
blue
eyes
like
miraculous
flowers
you
see
that
i
have
plenty
of
them
too
and
that
this
one
here
is
sick
stay
here
a
bit
she
smiled
soliciting
with
her
eyes
the
strangers
generosity
and
with
an
expression
in
which
one
guessed
the
desire
to
dissuade
the
curiosity
of
the
woman
by
the
vague
presentiment
of
a
peril
what
s
the
good
of
going
there
she
repeated
see
how
ill
this
one
is
and
again
she
showed
the
afflicted
child
but
without
simulating
any
sorrow
as
if
she
simply
offered
to
the
a
nearer
object
of
compassion
in
exchange
for
a
more
distant
if
she
wished
to
say
since
you
desire
to
be
compassionate
have
compassion
for
the
one
before
you
george
examined
with
deep
pain
the
poor
spotted
face
whose
large
bright
and
clear
eyes
seemed
to
drink
in
all
the
light
shed
on
this
june
evening
what
is
he
suffering
from
he
asked
ah
signor
who
ever
knows
answered
the
fat
woman
always
with
the
same
placidity
he
has
what
god
wishes
hippolyte
gave
her
some
money
and
they
resumed
their
way
towards
the
other
cottage
bearing
with
them
the
nauseous
odor
emanating
from
that
door
full
of
shadow
they
did
not
speak
they
felt
a
contraction
of
their
hearts
a
disgust
in
their
mouths
a
weakness
in
their
limbs
they
heard
the
shrill
wailing
mingled
with
other
voices
other
sounds
and
they
were
stupefied
at
having
been
able
to
hear
this
single
sound
so
far
away
and
so
distinctly
but
what
attracted
their
eyes
was
the
tall
and
straight
pine
whose
robust
trunk
stood
out
black
against
the
diffused
light
of
the
twilight
sustaining
a
melodious
summit
filled
with
sparrows
at
their
approach
a
whisper
passed
among
the
women
gathered
around
the
victim
here
are
the
s
strangers
come
come
and
the
women
opened
their
circle
to
permit
the
arrivals
to
draw
nearer
one
of
them
an
old
woman
with
wrinkled
skin
of
the
color
of
parched
earth
expressionless
eyes
whitish
and
as
if
vitrified
in
the
depths
of
their
hollow
orbits
said
addressing
hippolyte
and
touching
her
arm
look
signora
look
the
ghouls
are
sucking
it
poor
creature
look
at
the
state
they
ve
reduced
it
to
may
god
protect
your
children
her
voice
was
so
dry
that
it
appeared
artificial
and
resembled
the
sounds
articulated
by
an
automaton
cross
yourself
signora
she
added
again
the
advice
seemed
lugubrious
in
that
lifeless
mouth
in
which
the
voice
lost
its
human
character
and
became
a
dead
thing
hippolyte
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
looked
at
her
companion
in
the
space
before
the
door
of
the
hut
the
women
ere
in
a
circle
as
around
a
spectacle
making
from
time
to
time
some
mechanical
sign
of
condolence
and
the
circle
was
unceasingly
renewed
some
already
tired
of
looking
went
away
others
arrived
from
neighboring
houses
and
almost
all
at
the
sight
of
this
slow
death
repeated
the
same
gesture
repeated
the
same
words
the
child
reposed
in
a
little
cradle
of
rough
pine
boards
like
a
small
lidless
coffin
the
poor
creature
naked
sickly
emaciated
greenish
was
wailing
continuously
and
waving
its
debilitated
arms
and
legs
which
had
nothing
more
than
skin
and
bone
as
if
asking
for
help
and
the
mother
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
cradle
bent
in
two
her
head
so
low
that
it
almost
touched
her
knees
seemed
to
hear
nothing
it
seemed
as
if
some
terrible
weight
rested
on
her
neck
and
prevented
her
from
rising
at
times
mechanically
she
placed
on
the
edge
of
the
cradle
a
coarse
callous
hand
burnt
by
the
sun
and
she
made
the
gesture
of
rocking
without
altering
her
attitude
or
breaking
the
silence
then
the
holy
images
the
talismans
and
the
relics
with
which
the
pine
cradle
was
almost
entirely
covered
undulated
and
tinkled
during
a
momentary
pause
in
the
wail
liberata
liberata
cried
one
of
the
women
shaking
her
look
liberata
the
lady
has
lady
is
in
your
house
look
the
mother
slowly
raised
her
head
and
looked
around
her
with
a
bewildered
air
then
she
fixed
on
her
visitor
her
dry
and
mournful
eyes
in
whose
depths
there
was
less
of
fatigued
sorrow
than
inert
and
shadowy
terror
of
nocturnal
witchcraft
against
which
no
exorcism
prevailed
the
terror
of
those
insatiable
beings
who
now
had
the
house
in
their
power
and
who
would
not
abandon
it
perhaps
but
with
the
last
corpse
speak
speak
insisted
one
of
the
women
shaking
her
again
by
the
arm
speak
ask
the
lady
to
send
you
to
the
madonna
of
the
miracles
the
others
surrounded
hippolyte
with
supplications
yes
signora
be
charitable
to
her
send
her
to
the
madonna
send
her
to
the
madonna
the
child
cried
louder
in
the
tops
of
the
the
sparrows
were
emitting
cries
in
the
neighborhood
between
the
deformed
trunks
of
the
a
dog
barked
the
moon
was
beginning
to
cast
its
shadows
yes
stammered
hippolyte
incapable
of
sustaining
longer
the
fixed
gaze
of
the
silent
mother
yes
yes
we
will
send
no
not
saturday
signora
saturday
is
the
vigil
let
her
buy

a
candle
a

dumb
signora
she
hasn
t
spoken
for
three
days
in
the
midst
of
the
confused
cries
of
the
women
the
child
cried
still
louder
do
you
hear
how
he
cries
he
always
cries
loudest
signora
at
nightfall
perhaps
it

coming
soon
perhaps

maria
all
were
silent
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
bowed
it
seemed
as
if
several
sonorous
waves
scarcely
perceptible
arrived
from
the
distant
but
the
child
s
wail
filled
every
listener
s
ear
once
more
only
this
single
wail
could
be
heard
the
mother
had
fallen
on
her
knees
at
the
foot
of
the
cradle
prostrated
to
the
earth
hippolyte
her
head
bowed
was
praying
with
fervor
look
there
in
the
doorway
whispered
one
of
the
women
to
her
neighbor
george
watchful
and
uneasy
turned
his
head
the
doorway
was
full
of
shadow
look
there
in
the
doorway
don
t
you
see
something
yes
i
see
replied
the
other
uncertain
a
little
frightened
what
is
it
what
do
you
see
asked
a
third
what
is
it
demanded
a
fourth
what
is
it
suddenly
curiosity
and
fright
seized
them
all
they
looked
toward
the
door
the
child
cried
the
mother
rose
and
she
too
began
to
fix
her
dilated
eyes
on
the
door
which
the
shadows
rendered
mysterious
the
dog
barked
among
the
what
is
it
said
george
in
a
low
voice
but
not
without
requiring
some
effort
to
shake
off
the
increasing
uneasiness
of
his
imagination
what
do
you
see
none
of
the
women
dared
to
answer
all
in
the
shadow
saw
the
outlines
of
a
vague
form
then
he
advanced
toward
the
door
when
he
crossed
the
threshold
a
heat
and
a
repugnant
stench
cut
short
his
breath
he
turned
round
went
out
it
s
a
scythe
he
said
in
fact
it
was
a
scythe
hanging
on
the
wall
ah
a
scythe
and
the
voices
recommenced
liberata

iii
the
dog
continued
to
bark
in
the
while
george
and
hippolyte
came
back
by
the
path
towards
candia
s
house
when
the
animal
recognized
the
guests
of
the
house
he
stopped
barking
and
came
to
meet
them
joyfully
why
it
s
giardino
cried
hippolyte
and
she
stooped
to
caress
the
poor
beast
with
whom
she
had
already
become
friends
he
was
calling
us
it
s
getting
late
the
moon
rose
in
the
silence
of
the
sky
slowly
preceded
by
a
luminous
wave
which
gradually
covered
the
azure
all
the
sounds
of
the
surrounding
fields
died
away
beneath
this
pacific
light
and
the
unexpected
cessation
of
every
noise
seemed
almost
supernatural
to
george
whom
an
inexplicable
fright
kept
alert
stop
a
moment
he
said
holding
hippolyte
back
and
he
listened
intently
what
are
you
listening
to
it
seemed
to
and
both
looked
back
in
the
direction
of
the
barn
which
the
concealed
from
view
but
they
heard
nothing
except
the
even
and
rocking
rhythm
of
the
sea
in
the
curve
of
the
little
gulf
over
their
heads
a
cricket
clove
the
air
in
its
flight
with
a
grating
sound
like
that
of
a
diamond
on
a
pane
of
glass
don
t
you
think
the
child
is
dead
asked
george
without
dissimulating
his
emotion
he
stopped
crying
that
s
true
said
hippolyte
and
you
believe
he
s
dead
george
did
not
reply
and
they
resumed
their
way
back
beneath
the
silvery
did
you
notice
the
mother
well
he
asked
at
last
after
a
silence
possessed
internally
by
the
sombre
image
my
god
my
god
and
that
old
woman
who
touched
your
elbow
what
a
voice
what
eyes
his
words
betrayed
the
strange
fright
which
dominated
him
as
if
the
recent
spectacle
had
been
a
frightful
revelation
to
him
as
if
life
had
suddenly
been
made
manifest
to
him
under
a
mysterious
and
savage
aspect
bruising
and
stamping
him
with
an
indelible
sign
you
know
when
i
entered
the
house
on
the
ground
behind
the
door
there
was
the
corpse
of
some
the
smell
was
simply
choking
what
do
you
mean
it
was
either
a
cat
or
a
dog
i
could
not
distinguish
very
well
it
was
difficult
to
see
well
inside
are
you
sure
yes
yes
without
any
doubt
there
was
a
dead
animal
the
a
shudder
of
disgust
ran
through
him
as
he
thought
of
it
what
could
it
be
said
hippolyte
who
felt
herself
becoming
infected
by
the
contagion
of
fear
and
disgust
how
can
i
know
the
dog
gave
a
bark
to
announce
their
coming
they
had
arrived
candia
was
waiting
for
them
and
the
table
was
already
spread
beneath
the
oak
how
late
you
are
signora
cried
the
affable
hostess
with
a
smile
where
have
you
been
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
guess
well
you
have
been
to
see
the
child
of
liberata
maunella
may
jesus
guard
us
from
the
cunning
one
when
the
lovers
were
at
table
she
approached
curious
to
speak
and
question
did
you
see
him
signora
he
gets
no
better
he
s
just
as
bad
yet
his
father
and
mother
have
done
everything
to
save
him
what
had
they
not
done
candia
related
all
the
remedies
attempted
all
the
exorcisms
the
priest
had
been
there
and
after
having
covered
the
child
s
head
with
the
edge
of
his
stole
had
read
verses
from
the
bible
the
mother
had
suspended
from
the
lintel
of
the
door
a
waxen
cross
blessed
on
ascension
day
she
had
sprinkled
with
holy
water
the
hinges
of
the
imposts
and
recited
aloud
the
thrice
in
succession
she
had
put
a
handful
of
salt
in
a
piece
of
linen
which
afterwards
she
had
knotted
and
hung
around
the
neck
of
her
dying
son
the
father
done
the
seven
for
seven
consecutive
nights
he
had
watched
in
the
dark
before
a
lighted
lantern
covered
with
a
pot
attentive
to
the
slightest
sound
ready
to
assail
and
seize
the
ghoul
a
single
would
have
sufficed
to
render
it
visible
to
human
eyes
but
the
seven
vigils
had
gone
by
without
result
the
child
wasted
away
and
was
consumed
hour
by
hour
hopelessly
finally
on
the
advice
of
a
witch
the
despairing
father
had
killed
a
dog
and
put
the
body
behind
the
door
this
prevented
the
ghoul
entering
before
having
counted
all
the
hairs
of
the
dead
beast
do
you
hear
said
george
to
hippolyte
they
did
not
eat
their
hearts
oppressed
with
pity
struck
with
terror
at
the
sudden
apparition
of
these
phantoms
of
an
obscure
and
atrocious
life
which
environed
the
leisures
of
their
useless
love
may
jesus
protect
us
from
the
cunning
one
repeated
candia
and
piously
with
her
open
hand
she
indicated
the
place
where
lay
the
living
fruit
may
god
protect
your
children
signora
then
she
added
you
re
not
eating
this
evening
you
ve
no
appetite
that
innocent
soul
distresses
your
hearts
and
your
husband
isn
t
eating
either
look
hippolyte
said
do
many
that
oh
went
on
candia
this
is
a
bad
district
the
cursed
brood
swarms
hereabouts
one
is
never
safe
may
jesus
protect
us
from
the
cunning
one
she
repeated
the
conjuration
then
added
pointing
to
a
plate
on
the
table
do
you
see
those
fish
they
are
from
the
trabocco
they
were
brought
by
turchin
and
she
lowered
her
voice
do
you
want
to
know
for
nearly
a
year
turcum
and
all
his
family
have
been
in
the
power
of
some
witchcraft
from
which
he
has
not
yet
been
able
to
free
himself
who
is
turchin
asked
george
listening
breathlessly
to
the
woman
s
words
fascinated
by
the
mystery
of
these
things
the
man
from
the
trabocco
and
he
recalled
that
earthy
visage
almost
chinless
scarcely
larger
than
a
fist
with
a
long
nose
prominent
and
pointed
like
the
snout
of
a
pike
between
two
small
glittering
eyes
yes
signor
look
over
there
if
your
sight
is
good
you
can
see
him
he
is
fishing
by
moonlight
and
candia
pointed
out
on
the
rocks
the
great
fishing
collection
of
trunks
freed
from
their
bark
planks
and
cables
whose
strange
whiteness
resembled
the
colossal
skeleton
of
some
antediluvian
amphibian
in
the
calm
air
was
heard
the
creaking
of
the
capstan
as
the
tide
was
low
and
the
rocks
were
uncovered
the
odor
of
the
algæ
came
up
victorious
from
the
beach
stronger
and
fresher
than
the
effluvia
from
the
fertile
hill
hippolyte
breathed
in
the
intoxicating
odor
already
entirely
occupied
by
that
intense
sensation
which
made
her
nostrils
quiver
and
her
eyes
she
murmured
oh
how
delicious
don
t
you
smell
it
george
he
on
his
part
was
very
attentive
to
candia
s
words
and
saw
in
imagination
the
silent
drama
suspended
over
the
sea
to
the
phantoms
evoked
by
this
simple
woman
in
the
serene
night
his
soul
inclined
to
mystery
and
naturally
superstitious
gave
limitless
life
and
tragic
horror
for
the
first
time
he
had
a
vast
and
confused
vision
of
that
race
unknown
to
him
of
all
that
miserable
flesh
full
of
animal
instincts
and
of
bestial
afflictions
bent
and
sweating
on
the
glebe
or
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
cottages
beneath
the
perpetual
menace
of
those
dark
powers
amidst
the
sweet
richness
of
the
country
which
he
had
selected
as
the
theatre
of
his
love
he
discovered
a
violent
human
agitation
and
it
was
as
if
he
had
discovered
a
swarm
of
insects
in
the
masses
of
magnificent
hair
impregnated
with
aroma
he
felt
the
same
shudder
already
felt
before
this
at
the
contact
with
brutally
revealed
life
recently
at
the
sight
of
his
relatives
of
his
father
of
his
brother
of
the
poor
bigoted
glutton
all
at
once
he
felt
as
if
he
were
no
longer
alone
with
his
mistress
amidst
the
benign
growths
under
the
bark
of
which
he
had
one
day
believed
he
had
surprised
a
new
emotion
he
felt

by
an
unknown
crowd
which
bearing
in
itself
the
same
vitality
which
the
trunks
of
trees
possess
blind
tenacious
and
unconquerable
adhered
to
him
by
the
bond
of
the
species
and
could
immediately
communicate
to
him
its
suffering
by
a
look
a
gesture
a
sigh
a
sob
a
groan
a
cry
ah
this
district
is
bad

but
the
messiah
of

will
come
to
purify
the

the
episode
of
the
messiah
of
chapelles
is
historical
oreste
de

born
in
at
chapelles
played
precisely
the
rôle
assigned
to
him
here
by
the
novelist
he
died
in
antonio

has
collected
and
published
curious
documents
concerning
this
personage
the
messiah
father
cried
candia
in
the
direction
of
the
house
when
is
the
messiah
to
be
here
the
old
man
appeared
upon
the
threshold
one
of
these
days
he
replied
and
turning
toward
the
beach
which
in
the
dim
light
cast
by
the
disappeared
to
view
in
the
direction
of
ortona
he
signified
with
a
vague
gesture
the
mystery
of
that
new
deliverer
in
whom
the
country
people
had
placed
their
hope
and
faith
one
of
these
soon
and
the
old
man
who
wanted
to
talk
approached
the
table
looked
at
his
guests
with
an
uncertain
smile
and
asked
don
t
you
know
who
it
is
perhaps
it
is
semplice
said
george
in
whose
memory
revived
a
distant
and
indistinct
recollection
of
that
semplice
di
sulmone
who
fell
into
an
ecstasy
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
sun
no
signor
sembri
is
dead
the
new
messiah
is
oreste
of
chapelles
and
the
old
man
in
fervent
and
vividly
colored
language
related
the
new
legend
such
as
it
had
been
conceived
by
the
rural
population
oreste
being
a
capuchin
monk
had
known
semplice
at
sulmone
and
had
learned
from
him
the
art
of
reading
the
future
on
the
face
of
the
rising
sun
then
he
began
to
travel
all
over
the
world
he
had
gone
to
rome
and
had
spoken
with
the
pope
in
another
place
he
had
spoken
with
the
king
on
his
return
to
chapelles
his
birthplace
he
had
passed
seven
years
in
the
cemetery
in
the
company
of
skeletons
wearing
a
hair
shirt
flagellating
himself
night
and
day
according
to
discipline
he
had
preached
in
the
parish
church
and
had
drawn
tears
and
cries
from
the
fishers
then
he
had
started
once
more
on
a
pilgrimage
to
all
the
sanctuaries
he
had
remained
thirty
days
on
the
mountain
of
ancona
he
had
remained
twelve
days
on
mount
bernard
he
had
climbed
the
highest
peaks
struggling
through
the
snow
his
head
bared
returned
again
to
chapelles
he
had
recommenced
to
preach
in
his
church
but
shortly
afterwards
persecuted
and
driven
away
by
his
enemies
he
had
sought
refuge
in
the
island
of
corsica
and
there
he
had
made
himself
an
apostle
resolved
to
traverse
all
italy
and
to
write
the
name
of
the
virgin
in
his
blood
on
the
gate
of
every
city
as
an
apostle
he
had
returned
to
his
native
place
announcing
that
he
had
seen
a
star
in
the
midst
of
a
thicket
of
trees
and
that
from
it
he
had
received
the
word
and
finally
by
the
inspiration
of
the
eternal
father
he
had
taken
the
great
name
of
the
new
messiah
he
was
now
making
his
pilgrimage
through
the
rural
districts
dressed
in
a
red
tunic
and
a
blue
mantle
with
long
hair
down
to
his
shoulders
and
his
beard
trimmed
like
christ
s
his
apostles

they
had

cattle
to

they
had
led
a
woman
to
the
altar
and
procreated
children
and
seen
these
children
grow
flourish
die
in
short
they
had
lived
the
ordinary
life
of
country
people
amidst
their
equals
and
now
they
passed
followers
of
the
messiah
considered
as
divine
personages
by
the
same
people
with
whom
the
previous
week
they
had
argued
concerning
a
measure
of
wheat
they
passed
transfigured
participating
in
the
divinity
of
oreste
invested
with
his
grace
whether
in
the
fields
or
in
the
house
they
had
heard
they
had
all
at
once
felt
pure
souls
enter
into
their
sinful
flesh
the
spirit
of
saint
john
was
in
giuseppe
coppa
that
of

zacharias
in

the
women
also
had
received
the

of
senegallia
married
to
a
certain
augustinone
a
tailor
at
chapelles
in
order
to
demonstrate
to
the
messiah
the
ardor
of
her
faith
had
wanted
to
renew
the
sacrifice
of
abraham
by
setting
fire
to
a
mattress
on
which
slept
her
children
other
women
had
given
other
proofs
and
the
elect
now
wandered
through
the
country
with
his
escort
of
apostles
and
of
marys
from
the
most
distant
places
of
the
coast
and
mountain
multitudes
flocked
to
see
him
pass
at
daybreak
when
he
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
he
had
lodged
he
always
saw
a
great
crowd
kneeling
in
expectation
erect
on
the
threshold
he
delivered
the
word
received
confessions
administered
communion
with
pieces
of
bread
for
his
nourishment
he
preferred
eggs
prepared
with
elder
flowers
or
with
the
tips
of
wild
asparagus
he
also
ate
a
mixture
of
honey
nuts
and
almonds
which
he
called
to
recall
the
manna
of
the
desert
his
miracles
could
no
longer
be
counted
by
the
simple
virtue
of
the
thumb
index
and
middle
fingers
raised
in
the
air
he
delivered
the
possessed
cured
the
infirm
resurrected
the
dead
if
anyone
went
to
consult
him
he
did
not
even
give
him
time
to
open
his
mouth
and
immediately
told
him
the
names
of
his
parents
explained
his
family
affairs
and
revealed
to
him
the
most
obscure
secrets
he
also
gave
news
of
the
souls
of
the
dead
he
indicated
places
where
treasures
were
hidden
with
certain
scapularies
in
the
form
of
a
triangle
he
delivered

from
melancholies

george
asked
gravely
and
where
is
he
now
he
is
at
piomba
replied
the
old
man
and
he
pointed
to
the
distant
shores
on
the
other
side
of
ortono
evoking
in
his
guest
s
mind
the
vision
of
that
corner
of
the
province
of
teramo
bathed
by
the
almost
mystic
vision
of
fertile
lands
watered
by
little
sinuous
rivers
where
beneath
the
endless
shivering
of
the
poplars
a
stream
of
water
ran
over
a
bed
of
polished
sand
after
an
interval
of
silence
colas
added
at
piomba
one
word
from
him
sufficed
to
stop
the
train
on
the
railroad
my
son
saw
it
didn
t
vito
tell
us
that
candia
candia
confirmed
the
old
man
s
words
and
gave
the
details
of
the
wonderful
event
the
messiah
attired
in
his
red
tunic
had
advanced
to
meet
the
train
walking
calmly
between
the
two
rails
while
speaking
candia
and
the
old
man
incessantly
directed
their
gaze
as
well
as
their
gestures
towards
the
distance
as
if
the
sacred
person
of
the
expected
arrival
were
already
visible
to
them
listen
interrupted
hippolyte
pulling
the
arm
of
george
who
was
absorbed
in
an
inner
view
more
and
more
vast
and
distinct
don
t
you
hear
something
she
rose
crossed
the
court
went
close
to
the
parapet
under
the
acacias
he
followed
her
they
listened
it
s
a
procession
going
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
madonna
of
casalbordino
said
candia
in
the
peaceful
moonlight
a
religious
chant
swelled
its
slow
and
monotonous
rhythm
with
an
alternation
of
masculine
and
feminine
voices
at
equal
intervals
one
of
these
chanted
a
strophe
in
a
low
tone
the
other
chanted
a
refrain
in
a
higher
key
indefinitely
prolonging
the
cadence
it
was
like
the
approach
of
a
wave
continuously
rising
and
falling
the
procession
approached
with
a
rapidity
which
contrasted
with
the
slowness
of
the
rhythm
already
the
first
pilgrims
appeared
at
the
turn
of
the
path
near
the
bridge
of
the
trabocco
here
they
are
exclaimed
hippolyte
moved
by
the
novelty
of
the
scene
and
sounds
here
they
are
what
a
number
of
them
they
advanced
in
a
compact
mass
and
the
opposition
of
the
measure
between
their
march
and
their
chant
was
so
strange
that
it
gave
them
an
almost
fantastic
appearance
it
seemed
as
if
a
supernatural
force
impelled
them
on
unconscious
towards
the
goal
while
the
words
emitted
from
their
mouths
remained
suspended
in
the
luminous
air
and
continued
to
vibrate
after
their
passage
maria
maria
they
passed
with
a
heavy
trampling
exhaling
a
sour
herdlike
odor
so
jammed
one
to
the
other
that
nothing
emerged
from
their
mass
except
the
long
sticks
fashioned
like
a
cross
the
men
marched
in
front
and
the
women
more
numerous
behind
with
the
glittering
of
golden
ornaments
underneath
their
white
bandelets
maria
her
creator
near
by
at
every
repetition
their
chant
had
the
vehemence
of
a
cry
then
it
diminished
in
vigor
betraying
fatigue
surmounted
by
a
continual
and
unanimous
effort
the
initiative
of
which
in
the
two
almost
always
started
in
a
single
and
more
powerful
voice
and
this
voice
dominated
not
only
the
others
when
it
intoned
the
measure
but
often
in
the
midst
of
the
musical
wave
it
was
maintained
high
and
recognizable
during
the
entire
duration
of
the
strophe
or
refrain
denoting
a
more
imperious
faith
a
singular
and
dominating
soul
among
that
indistinct
crowd
george
remarked
it
and
very
attentive
followed
it
as
it
waned
in
the
distance
as
long
as
his
ear
could
recognize
it
and
that
gave
rise
in
him
to
an
extraordinary
sentiment
of
the
mystic
power
which
lay
at
the
roots
of
the
great
indigenous
race
from
which
he
himself
had
sprung
the
procession
disappeared
in
the
curve
of
the
coast
then
reappeared
on
the
summit
of
the
promontory
in
the
light
then
disappeared
again
and
the
chant
through
the
distant
night
became
veiled
softened
became
so
light
that
the
slow
and
uniform
modulation
of
the
calm
sea
almost
drowned
it
seated
on
the
parapet
her
shoulders
leaning
against
the
trunk
of
an
acacia
hippolyte
remained
silent
motionless
not
daring
to
disturb
the
religious
meditations
in
which
her
lover
seemed
plunged
what
could
the
beams
of
the
brightest
sunlight
reveal
to
george
that
this
simple
chant
in
the
night
had
not
already
revealed
to
him
all
the
scattered
images
recent
and
ancient
those
still
vibrating
with
the
keen
sensation
which
had
given
birth
to
them
and
those
buried
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
his
memory
all
these
were
bound
together
internally
and
composed
for
him
an
ideal
spectacle
which
carried
him
over
the
most
vast
and
most
august
reality
his
land
and
his
race
appeared
to
him
transfigured
uplifted
from
time
with
a
legendary
and
formidable
aspect
weighty
with
mysterious
eternal
and
nameless
things
a
mountain
like
unto
an
enormous
primeval
stump
reared
up
in
the
centre
in
the
form
of
a
breast
perpetually
covered
with
snows
and
the
sloping
sides

promontories
devoted
to
the

there
by

inconstant
and
sad
sea

sails

colors
of
mourning

wide
as
rivers

from

with

they
went
towards
the
altar
singing
the
men
and
boys
crowned
with
roses
and
with
dewy
berries
climbed
in
their
pilgrimage
on
a
rock
on
which
was
impressed
a
footprint
of
sampson

white
bullock
fattened
for
a
year
on
a
rich
pasturage
covered
by
a
vermilion
and
ridden
by
a
child
advanced
with
pomp
among
the
standards
and
candles
it
knelt
on
the
threshold
of
the
temple
in
the
midst
of
the
applause
of
the
people
then
arrived
at
the
centre
of
the
nave
it
voided
its
excrements
and
the
devotees
drew
from
this
steaming
matter
presages
as
to
their
agriculture
on
feast
days
the
fluvial
populations
bound
their
heads
with
bryony
and
at
night
they
crossed
the
water
with
songs
and
music
bearing
in
their
hands
branches
full
of
leaves
at
daybreak
in
the
fields
the
virgins
washed
their
hands
feet
and
faces
in
the
fresh
dew
to
accomplish
a
vow
on
the
mountains
on
the
plains
the
first
sun
of
the
spring
was
saluted
by
ancient
hymns
by
the
clash
of
crashing
metals
by
cries
and
dances
throughout
the
entire
district

men
women

from
their
lethargy
seized
them
alive
and
wound
them
around
their
necks
and
arms
so
as
to
present
themselves
thus
ornamented
before
their
saint
who
would
render
them
proof
against
venomous
bites
on
the
inclines
of
the
hills
the
young
toilers
with
their
yoked
oxen
in

of
their
old
men
rivalled
one
another
as
to
who
should
trace
the
straightest
furrow
from
the
to
the
plain
and
the
judges
awarded
the
prize
to
the
conqueror

in
tears
opened
his

to
his

so
in

the
labors
in
all
the
games
in
the
births
in
the

venerated

from

a
loaf
of
bread
and
on
the
loaf
a
flower
they
entered
one

and
sprinkled
a
handful
of
that
augural
grain
on
the
head
of
the
happy
wife
at
the
foot
of

the
fruit
thus
assumed
superior
significance
and
power
a
profound
sentiment
and
continual
desire
for
mystery

to
all
these

an

the
heavens
troubled
the
eyes
mystery
and
rhythm
those
two
essential
elements
of
every
cult
were
scattered
everywhere
men
and
women
continually
expressed
their
soul
in
song
accompanied
by
song
all
their
labors
under
roof
and
heaven
celebrated
by
song
both
life
and
death
around
the
cradles
and
around
the
biers
music
was
shed
slow
and
persistent
very
ancient
as
ancient
perhaps
as
the
race
whose
profound
sorrows
they
manifested
sad
grave
fixed
in
immutable
rhythm
they
seemed
the
fragments
of
hymns
that
had
belonged
to
the
immemorial
liturgies
which
had
survived
the
destruction
of
some
great
primordial
myth
they
were
few
in
number
but
so
dominating
that
the
new
songs
could
not
displace
them
or
diminish
their
hold
they
were
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
like
an
inner
heritage
inherent
in
the
corporeal
substance
and
each
one
on
awaking
in
this
life
heard
them
resound
in
himself
like
an
innate
language
to
which
the
voice
gave
a
visible
form
just
as
well
as
the
mountains
the
valleys
and
the
rivers
just
as
well
as
the
customs
the
vices
the
virtues
and
beliefs
they
termed
a
part
of
the
structure
of
the
country
and
of
the
race
they
were
as
immortal
as
the
glebe
and
as
the
blood
such
was
the
country
such
was
the
race
visited
by
this
new
messiah
of
whom
the
old
peasant
had
related
the
life
and
miracles
who
was
this
man
an
ascetic
ingenuous
and
innocent
as
semplice
the
worshipper
of
the
sun
a
cunning
and
covetous
charlatan
who
was
trying
to
play
upon
the
credulity
of
his
devotees
for
his
own
profit
who
really
was
this
man
who
from
the
border
of
a
small
river
could
gather
by
his
name
alone
multitudes
from
both
near
and
far
induce
mothers
to
desert
their
children
awaken
in
the
souls
of
the
most
ignorant
the
visions
and
the
voices
of
another
world
and
once
more
george
evoked
the
figure
of
oreste
attired
in
his
red
tunic
going
up
the
little
sinuous
river
where
beneath
the
endless
shivering
of
the
poplars
a
stream
of
water
ran
over
a
bed
of
polished
sand
who
knows
he
thought
if
this
unexpected
revelation
will
not
be
my
salvation
in
order
that
i
should
be
myself
again
in
order
that
i
should
recognize
my
true
essence
do
i
not
need
to
put
myself
in
immediate
contact
with
the
race
from
which
i
have
sprung
in
burying
again
the
roots
of
my
being
in
the
natal
soil
shall
i
not
suck
up
a
pure
and
revivifying
sap
which
will
have
the
power
to
expel
all
that
is
false
and
heterogeneous
in
me
all
that
i
have
consciously
and
unconsciously
received
by
a
thousand
contagions
just
now
i
do
not
seek
the
truth
i
seek
only
to
recuperate
my
own
substance
to
replace
in
myself
the
characters
of
my
race
so
as
to
strengthen
them
and
render
them
as
intense
as
possible
in
thus
harmonizing
my
soul
with
the
diffused
soul
i
shall
recover
that
equilibrium
which
i
lack
for
the
intellectual
man
the
secret
of
equilibrium
is
to
know
how
to
transport
the
instincts
the
wants
the
tendencies
and
the
fundamental
sentiments
of
his
race
to
a
superior
order
mystery
and
rhythm
were
scattered
everywhere
near
by
on
the
foaming
beach
the
sea
breathed
at
equal
intervals
but
during
the
pauses
one
heard
more
and
more
feebly
the
cadences
of
the
waves
which
touched
the
shore
at
constantly
increasing
periods
reverberated
doubtless
by
the
echo
of
some
sonorous
hollow
the
chant
of
the
pilgrims
was
heard
once
more
then
died
away
over
the
vasto
d
aimone
the
sky
was
lit
up
by
frequent
flashes
of
lightning
and
in
the
calm
moonlight
the
flashes
appeared
red
hippolyte
was
dreaming
leaning
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
her
eyes
watching
the
silent
flashes
she
had
not
made
a
single
movement
her
prolonged
immobility
in
the
same
attitude
was
frequent
enough
and
at
times
it
took
on
a
cataleptic
appearance
which
was
almost
alarming
she
had
then
no
longer
the
young
and
kind
aspect
which
the
plants
and
beasts
knew
so
well
but
the
appearance
of
a
taciturn
and
indomptable
creature
in
whom
were
concentrated
all
the
isolated
exclusive
and
destructive
virtues
of
the
passion
of
love
the
three
divine
elements
of
her
brow
her
eyes
her
perhaps
never
attained
such
a
degree
of
symbolic
intensity
to
illustrate
the
principle
of
the
eternal
feminine
fascination
it
seemed
that
the
serene
night
favored
this
sublimation
of
her
form
that
it
liberated
the
true
ideal
essence
of
her
being
that
it
permitted
her
lover
to
know
her
entirely
not
by
the
acuteness
of
view
but
by
that
of
thought
the
summer
night
full
of
lunary
brilliancy
and
of
dreams
and
of
pale
or
invisible
stars
and
of
the
most
melodious
marine
voices
seemed
the
natural
field
of
that
sovereign
image
the
same
as
the
shadow
grew
at
times
out
of
entire
proportion
to
the
body
that
caused
it
the
same
as
against
the
infinity
of
that
background
the
fatality
of
love
rendered
the
person
of
hippolyte
higher
and
more
tragic
for
the
spectators
whose
prescience
became
every
instant
more
lucid
and
more
terrible
was
it
not
in
the
same
immobility
the
same
woman
who
from
the
height
of
the
loggia
had
contemplated
the
single
white
sail
on
the
dead
waters
it
was
she
and
now
again
in
spite
of
the
night
which
despoiled
her
person
of
all
brutal
reality
the
same
hatred
moved
under
the
sentiment
excited
by
mortal
hatred
of
the
sexes
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
love
and
which
occult
or
openly
subsists
at
the
bottom
of
every
effect
from
the
first
glance
up
to
extreme
disgust
so
he
thought
she
is
the
enemy
as
long
as
she
lives
as
long
as
she
can
exercise
her
empire
over
me
she
will
prevent
me
from
putting
foot
on
the
threshold
i
perceive
and
how
can
i
recover
my
substance
if
a
great
portion
of
myself
is
in
the
hands
of
this
woman
vain
is
the
aspiration
towards
the
new
world
towards
a
new
life
as
long
as
love
endures
the
axis
of
the
world
rests
on
a
single
being
and
life
is
shut
in
by
a
narrow
circle
to
revive
and
conquer
i
must
free
myself
from
love
i
must
deliver
myself
from
the
enemy
once
more
he
imagined
her
dead
dead
she
would
become
an
object
for
thought
a
pure
ideality
from
a
precarious
and
imperfect
existence
she
would
enter
into
an
integral
and
definite
one
freed
forever
from
her
weak
flesh
so
frail
and
sensual
destroy
to
possess
he
who
seeks
the
absolute
in
love
has
no
other
means
suddenly
hippolyte
started
violently
as
if
an
extraordinary
shudder
had
shaken
her
she
said
alluding
to
the
common
superstition
death
has
just
passed
and
she
smiled
but
her
lover
struck
by
the
strange
coincidence
could
not
repress
an
instinctive
movement
of
stupor
and
fright
could
she
have
my
thought
the
dog
began
to
bark
with
sudden
fury
and
they
both
rose
at
the
same
time
who
is
it
said
hippolyte
uneasy
the
dog
barked
with
renewed
energy
still
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
candia
and
the
old
man
came
out
of
the
house
what
is
it
repeated
hippolyte
uneasy
who
can
it
be
said
the
old
man
gazing
into
the
darkness
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
came
from
the
an
imploring
sobbing
voice
then
appeared
an
indistinct
form
which
candia
immediately
recognized
liberata
the
mother
carried
on
her
head
the
cradle
covered
with
a
dark
cloth
she
walked
erect
almost
rigid
without
turning
without
deviating
from
her
path
absorbed
in
herself
mute
like
a
sinister
somnambulist
blindly
impelled
towards
an
unknown
goal
and
a
man
followed
her
bareheaded
beside
himself
sobbing
imploring
calling
her
by
her
name
bending
beating
his
sides
or
burying
his
hands
in
his
hair
with
gestures
of
atrocious
despair
grotesque
and
miserable
following
the
steps
of
the
deaf
woman
he
howled
amidst
his
sobs
liberata
liberata
listen
listen
come
back
to
the
house
oh
my
god
my
god
where
are
you
going
what
are
you
going
to
do
liberata
listen
listen
oh
my
god
my
god
he
implored
to
retain
her
to
stop
her
but
he
did
not
touch
her
he
held
his
hands
out
to
her
with
gestures
frantic
with
pain
but
he
did
not
touch
her
as
if
some
mysterious
cause
prevented
him
as
if
a
charm
had
rendered
that
person
intangible
candia
neither
went
to
meet
her
nor
did
she
bar
her
way
she
simply
asked
the
man
what
s
the
matter
what
s
happened
the
man
with
a
gesture
signified
her
dementia
and
that
recalled
to
the
memory
of
george
and
hippolyte
the
words
of
the
gossips
she
is
mad
she
has
become
mute
signora
she
has
not
spoken
for
three
days
she
is
mad
she
is
mad
candia
pointed
to
the
covered
cradle
asking
again
in
a
low
voice
is
he
dead
the
man
sobbed
louder
and
that
recalled
to
the
memory
of
george
and
hippolyte
the
words
of
the
gossips
he
s
stopped
crying
poor
creature
is
he
asleep
he
looks
like
a
little
corpse
he
doesn
t
move
he
s
asleep
he
s
asleep
he
s
not
in
pain
now
liberata
cried
candia
with
all
the
strength
of
her
lungs
as
if
to
rouse
the
impassive
creature
liberata
where
are
you
going
but
she
did
not
move
her
did
not
prevent
her
from
going
her
way
then
all
were
silent
and
watched
the
mother
continued
to
advance
tall
and
erect
almost
rigid
without
turning
fixing
before
her
her
dilated
and
dry
eyes
her
mouth
tightly
closed
a
mouth
which
seemed
closed
as
by
a
seal
as
if
already
vowed
to
perpetual
silence
and
deprived
of
breath
on
her
head
she
balanced
the
cradle
changed
into
a
coffin
and
the
lamentation
of
the
man
assumed
the
continuous
rhythm
of
a
monody
the
tragic
couple
crossed
the
court
in
this
way
descended
the
path
recently
beaten
by
the
steps
of
the
pilgrims
and
on
which
still
floated
the
religious
soul
that
the
hymn
had
left
there
and
the
lovers
their
hearts
oppressed
by
pity
and
horror
followed
with
their
eyes
the
figure
of
the
funereal
mother
who
disappeared
in
the
night
in
the
direction
of
the
flashing
lightning
iv
now
it
was
no
longer
hippolyte
but
george
who
proposed
long
excursions
long
explorations
condemned
to
be
always
waiting
for
life
he
believed
in
going
to
meet
it
to
find
and
gather
it
in
the
visible
realities
his
factitious
curiosity
was
attracted
now
to
those
things
which
scarcely
capable
of
effectively
moving
the
surface
of
the
soul
could
not
penetrate
it
and
stir
it
to
its
depth
he
tried
to
discover
between
his
soul
and
certain
things
connections
which
did
not
exist
he
tried
to
shake
the
indifference
of
his
inmost
being
that
inert
indifference
that
had
rendered
him
so
long
a
stranger
to
all
external
agitation
collecting
all
the
perspicuous
faculties
he
possessed
he
applied
himself
to
find
some
living
resemblance
between
himself
and
the
surrounding
nature
that
he
might
reconcile
himself
in
a
filial
way
with
that
nature
and
vow
to
it
eternal
fidelity
but
there
was
not
awakened
in
him
the
extraordinary
emotion
which
had
several
times
exalted
and
astounded
him
in
the
first
days
of
his
stay
at
the
hermitage
before
the
arrival
of
the
loved
one
he
could
resuscitate
neither
the
panicky
intoxication
of
the
first
day
when
he
had
believed
he
truly
felt
the
sun
in
his
heart
nor
the
melancholy
charm
of
the
first
solitary
walk
nor
the
unexpected
and
divine
joy
which
had
been
communicated
to
him
on
that
may
morning
by
the
song
of
favetta
and
the
perfume
of
the
furze
freshened
by
the
dew
on
the
earth
and
on
the
sea
men
cast
a
tragic
shadow
poverty
disease
dementia
terror
and
death
lay
in
wait
or
were
exhibited
everywhere
on
his
path
a
wave
of
fierce
fanaticism
was
sweeping
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
night
and
day
far
and
near
religious
hymns
resounded
monotonous
and
interminable
the
messiah
was
expected
and
the
poppies
in
the

recalled
the
image

for

the
juniper
for

held
the

the
laurel
because

springs
from
the
soil
sprinkled
by
the
water

which
had
been
washed
the
son
of

how
could
he
escape
the
fascination
of
the
mystery
which
spread
over
all
created
things
and
transfigured
them
into
signs
and
emblems
of
another
life
george
troubled
by
these
suggestions
which
provoked
in
him
the
confused
rising
of
all
his
mystic
tendencies
said
to
himself
oh
if
i
possessed
the
true
faith
that
faith
which
enabled
saint
theresa
to
see
god
in
the
host
and
this
was
not
a
vague
or
passing
desire
it
was
a
profound
and
fervent
aspiration
of
his
entire
soul
and
it
was
also
an
extraordinary
anguish
which
distressed
all
the
elements
of
his
substance
because
he
felt
that
this
was
the
secret
of
his
unhappiness
and
weakness
like
demetrius
aurispa
george
was
an
ascetic
without
a
god
and
he
reappeared
to
his
mind
a
mild
meditative
man
with
a
face
full
of
a
virile
melancholy
and
a
single
white
curl
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
among
the
black
hair
giving
him
an
odd
appearance
demetrius
was
his
real
father
by
a
singular
coincidence
of
names
that
spiritual
paternity
seemed
consecrated
in
the
legend
inscribed
around
the
marvellous
ostensory

by
the
ancestors

both
in
fact
beings
of
intelligence
and
sentiment
bore
the
mystic
heredity
of
the
house
of
aurispa
both
had
the
religious
soul
inclined
to
mystery
apt
to
live
in
a
forest
of
symbols
or
in
a
heaven
of
pure
abstractions
both
loved
the
ceremonies
of
the
latin
church
sacred
music
the
perfume
of
incense
all
the
sensualities
of
worship
the
most
violent
and
the
most
delicate
but
they
had
lost
faith
they
knelt
before
an
altar
deserted
by
god
their
misery
arose
therefore
from
a
metaphysical
need
which
implacable
doubt
prohibited
to
blossom
to
satisfy
to
repose
on
the
divine
lap
as
they
had
not
conformed
themselves
in
such
a
manner
that
they
could
accept
and
sustain
the
battle
for
vulgar
existence
they
had
learned
the
necessity
of
seclusion
but
how
could
the
man
exiled
from
life
rest
in
a
cell
which
lacked
the
sign
of
the
eternal
solitude
is
the
supreme
proof
of
the
humility
or
the
sovereignty
of
a
soul
because
it
is
only
borne
on
the
condition
of
having
renounced
all
for
god
or
on
the
condition
of
having
a
soul
so
strong
that
it
might
serve
as
an
immovable
foundation
for
a
world
all
at
once
one
of
them
feeling
perhaps
that
the
violence
of
his
pain
began
to
exceed
the
resistance
of
his
organs
had
wished
to
transform
himself
by
death
into
a
higher
being
and
he
launched
into
the
mystery
from
which
he
contemplated
the
survivor
with
undimmed
demetrius
aurispa
et
unicus
georgius
filius
now
in
his
lucid
moments
the
survivor
comprehended
that
he
would
in
no
way
succeed
in
realizing
the
type
of
exuberant
life
the
dionysiac
ideal
seen
as
in
a
lightning
flash
beneath
the
great
oak
when
he
had
tasted
the
bread
freshly
broken
by
the
young
and
joyous
woman
he
realized
that
his
intellectual
and
moral
faculties
too
disproportioned
would
never
succeed
in
finding
their
equilibrium
and
their
model
he
realized
finally
that
instead
of
striving
to
reconquer
himself
for
himself
it
was
himself
he
should
renounce
and
that
two
ways
only
could
lead
him
to
it
either
to
follow
the
example
of
demetrius
or
to
give
himself
to
heaven
the
second
alternative
fascinated
him
in
considering
it
he
made
an
abstraction
of
the
unfavorable
circumstances
and
immediate
obstacles
impelled
by
his
irresistible
desire
to
completely
construct
all
his
illusions
and
to
inhabit
them
for
a
few
hours
on
this
natal
earth
did
he
not
feel
himself
enveloped
by
the
ardor
of
faith
much
more
than
by
the
fire
of
the
sun
had
he
not
in
his
veins
the
purest
christian
blood
did
not
the
ascetic
ideal
circulate
in
the
branches
of
his
race
from
the
noble
donor
demetrius
down
to
the
pitiful
creature
named
joconda
was
it
therefore
impossible
that
this
ideal
should
be
regenerated
in
him
should
be
elevated
to
its
supreme
heights
should
attain
the
limit
of
human
ecstasy
in
god
in
him
all
was
ready
to
magnify
the
event
he
possessed
every
quality
of
the
ascetic
the
contemplative
mind
the
taste
for
symbols
and
allegories
the
faculty
of
abstraction
an
extreme
sensibility
for
visual
and
aural
suggestions
an
organic
tendency
towards
dominating
images
and
hallucinations
he
lacked
but
one
thing
a
great
thing
but
which
perhaps
was
not
dead
in
him
and
only
slumbered
the
faith
the
ancient
faith
of
the
donor
the
ancient
faith
of
his
race
that
which
came
down
from
the
mountain
and
chanted
praises
on
the
seashore
how
to
awaken
it
how
to
resuscitate
it
no
artifice
would
be
efficacious
he
must
wait
for
a
sudden
spark
an
unexpected
shock
he
must
perhaps
like
the
followers
of
oreste
see
the
lightning
flash
and
hear
the
word
in
the
midst
of
a
field
at
the
turn
of
a
road
and
once
more
he
recalled
the
figure
of
oreste
attired
in
his
red
tunic
advancing
along
the
side
of
a
little
sinuous
river
where
beneath
the
shivering
of
the
poplars
a
stream
of
water
coursed
over
a
bed
of
polished
sand
he
imagined
a
meeting
a
conversation
with
oreste
it
was
at
noon
on
the
coast
close
to
a
field
of
wheat
the
messiah
spoke
like
a
simple
humble
man
smiling
with
virginal
candor
and
his
teeth
were
as
white
as
jasmine
in
the
great
silence
of
the
sea
the
continuous
murmur
of
the
breakers
at
the
foot
of
the
promontory
imitated
the
distant
chords
of
an
organ
but
behind
this
mild
person
in
the
gold
of
the
ripe
harvest
waved
the
poppies
violent
symbols
of
desire
desire
thought
george
thus
recalling
his
mistress
and
the
corporeal
sorrow
of
his
love
who
will
kill
desire
the
admonitions
of
ecclesiastes
recurred
to
him
des
mulieri
potestatem

tuae
a
muliere

factum

peccati
et
per
illam
omnes
he
saw
at
the
sacred
dawn
of
the
ages
in
a
delicious
garden
the
first
man
solitary
and
sad
attracted
by
the
first
companion
and
he
saw
this
companion
become
the
scourge
of
the
world
spread
everywhere
pain
and
death
but
voluptuousness
contemplated
as
a
sin
appeared
to
him
prouder
more
disturbing
it
seemed
to
him
that
no
other
intoxication
equalled
the
frantic
intoxication
of
the
embraces
to
which
the
martyrs
of
the
early
church
surrendered
themselves
in
the
prisons
where
they
awaited
punishment
he
evoked
pictures
of
women
who
mad
with
terror
and
love
presented
for
kisses
their
faces
bathed
in
silent
tears
in
aspiring
to
faith
and
redemption
what
did
he
therefore
but
aspire
to
new
thrills
and
spasms
to
unknown
voluptuous
sensations
infringe
on
duty
and
obtain
pardon
commit
a
fault
and
confess
it
tearfully
confess
the
slightest
miseries
while
exaggerating
them
and
accuse
oneself
of
mediocre
vices
while
magnifying
them
almost
to
enormity
incessantly
place
one
s
sick
soul
and
ailing
flesh
in
the
hands
of
a
merciful
not
these
things
an
entirely
sensual
fascination
from
the
beginning
his
passion
had
been
impregnated
with
a
pious
odor
of
incense
and
violets
he
recalled
the
epiphany
of
love
in
the
deserted
oratory
of
the
via
belsiana
the
little
mysterious
chapel
was
plunged
in
a
bluish
penumbra
a
choir
of
young
girls
garlanded
the
rostrum
curved
like
a
balcony
below
an
orchestra
of
string
instruments
stood
up
before
the
music
stands
of
white
pine
roundabout
in
the
oaken
stalls
were
seated
the
few
auditors
almost
all
gray
or
bald
the
beat
time
a
religious
odor
of
evaporated
incense
and
of
violets
mingled
with
the
music
of
sebastian
bach
he
recalled
also
the
dream
of
orvieto
conjured
up
once
more
the
vision
of
the
silent
city
of
the
guelphs
windows
closed
grayish
alleys
in
which
the
grasses
grew
a
capuchin
monk
crossing
a
square
a
bishop
all
in
black
descending
from
a
carriage
which
has
stopped
in
front
of
a
hospital
with
a
decrepit
servant
at
the
carriage
door
a
tower
rising
against
a
white
and
rainy
sky
a
clock
slowly
chiming
the
hour
and
all
of
a
sudden
at
the
bottom
of
a
street
a
duomo
had
he
not
dreamt
of
taking
refuge
at
the
summit
of
that
rock
of
tufa
crowned
by
monasteries
had
he
not
more
than
once
sincerely
aspired
to
that
silence
that
peace
and
now
this
dream
also
returned
to
his
soul
suggested
by
an
effeminate
languor
on
this
warm
and
ashy
april
day
to
have
a
mistress
or
to
express
it
better
a
who
would
be
very
devoted
to
go
away
yonder
and
stay
there
to
spend
hours
and
hours
in
the
cathedral
in
front
of
it
around
it
to
go
and
gather
roses
in
the
gardens
of
the
convents
to
visit
the
sisters
and
eat
preserves
to
love
a
great
deal
and
sleep
a
great
deal
in
a
soft
bed
all
veiled
in
virginal
white
between
two
he
was
seized
once
more
by
the
languid
nostalgia
of
the
darkness
of
the
silence
of
the
closed
and
isolated
retreat
in
which
could
blossom
the
most
frail
flowers
the
most
subtle
thoughts
the
most
disturbing
sensualities
all
that
dazzling
sunlight
on
those
lines
too
distinct
and
too
strong
appeared
almost
offensive
to
him
and
the
same
as
the
image
of
the
murmuring
spring
fascinates
the
brain
of
him
who
is
thirsty
so
he
was
haunted
by
the
cool
and
meditative
shadow
of
a
roman
nave
the
summons
of
the
bells
did
not
reach
as
far
as
the
hermitage
or
at
least
it
only
arrived
at
rare
intervals
on
the
swells
of
a
light
breeze
the
church
of
the
market
town
was
too
far
away
commonplace
perhaps
certainly
without
any
reputation
for
beauty
or
ancient
tradition
george
wanted
a
retreat
nearer
at
hand
and
one
worthy
of
him
where
his
mysticism
might
flower
æsthetically
as
in
that
deep
marble
urn
which
enclosed
the
dantesque
visions
of
luca
signorelli
he
recalled
the
abbey
of
saint
clement
at
casauria
seen
in
one
of
the
distant
days
of
his
adolescence
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
visited
it
in
the
company
of
demetrius
the
recollection
like
all
recollections
connected
with
his
kinsman
was
as
distinct
and
precise
as
if
it
had
dated
only
from
the
day
before
he
and
demetrius
were
descending
the
highroad
towards
the
abbey
still
hidden
by
the
trees
an
infinite
calm
reigned
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
solitary
and
magnificent
spot
over
the
wide
road
of
grasses
and
stones
deserted
uneven
as
if
marked
with
gigantic
and
silent
vestiges
and
the
beginning
of
which
was
lost
in
the
mystery
of
the
distant
and
sacred
mountains
one
felt
still
floating
there
a
primordial
holiness
as
if
the
grasses
and
stones
had
just
been
trodden
by
a
long
migration
of
biblical
bands
in
search
of
a
maritime
horizon
below
on
the
plain
the
basilica
a
ruin
all
around
the
ground
was
encumbered
with
débris
and
brambles
fragments
of
sculptured
stone
were
heaped
against
the
pillars
wild
grasses
hung
from
every
crevice
recent
constructions
of
brick
and
lime
closed
up
large
openings
in
the
lateral
arcades
the
doors
were
off
their
hinges
a
band
of
pilgrims
were
taking
a
siesta
in
the
court
brutishly
under
the
very
noble
portal
erected
by
leonato
the
magnificent
but
the
three
intact
arched
windows
above
the
several
capitals
looked
so
graceful
and
proud
and
the
september
sun
gave
to
the
light
and
soft
stone
such
a
precious
appearance
that
both
of
them
demetrius
and
himself
had
felt
they
were
in
the
presence
of
a
sovereign
beauty
fascinated
by
the
remembrance
the
survivor
had
only
one
wish
a
chimerical
return
to
the
spot
to
see
the
basilica
again
to
take
up
his
dwelling
there
so
as
to
protect
it
from
ruin
to
restore
it
to
its
primitive
beauty
to
reëstablish
there
the
great
worship
and
after
so
long
a
period
of
desertion
and
oblivion
renew
the
chronicon
casaurienne
he
said
to
hippolyte
perhaps
we
ll
change
our
quarters
do
you
remember
the
dream
of
orvieto
oh
yes
she
cried
the
city
of
convents
where
you
wanted
to
take
me
i
want
to
take
you
to
a
deserted
abbey
more
lonely
than
our
hermitage
beautiful
as
a
cathedral
full
of
very
old
memories
where
there
is
a
great
candelabra
of
white
marble
a
marvellous
work
of
art
by
some
unknown
artist
erect
on
the
candelabra
in
the
silence
you
will
illuminate
with
your
face
the
meditations
of
my
soul
he
smiled
at
this
lyric
phrase
while
contemplating
at
the
same
time
the
beautiful
image
evoked
and
she
in
the
ingenuousness
of
her
egotism
with
that
tenacious
animalism
which
is
the
basis
of
the
feminine
being
was
intoxicated
by
nothing
more
than
by
this
passing
poesy
her
happiness
was
to
appear
in
her
lover
s
eyes
idealized
like
the
first
evening
in
the
bluish
street
or
again
in
the
secret
oratory
amid
the
religious
music
and
the
faded
perfumes
or
like
on
the
wild
path
strewn
with
furze
in
her
most
chaste
voice
she
asked
when
do
we
go
will
you
go
very
take
care
if
you
rise
you
won
t
be
able
to
come
down
what
does
it
matter
i
ll
watch
you
you
will
burn
you
ll
be
consumed
like
a
candle
i
will
light
you
you
will
also
light
my
funeral
he
spoke
lightly
but
at
heart
with
his
ordinary
intensity
for
imaginary
life
he
composed
a
mystic
fable
after
long
years
of
error
on
the
abyss
of
sensuality
repentance
had
come
to
him
initiated
by
this
woman
in
all
the
mysteries
which
his
concupiscence
excited
he
now
implored
from
the
all
merciful
the
grace
which
would
dissipate
the
unbearable
sadness
of
this
carnal
love
pity
for
my
pleasures
in
the
past
and
for
my
suffering
in
the
present
grant
o
god
that
i
may
have
the
strength
to
accomplish
the
sacrifice
in
your
name
and
he
fled
followed
by
his
mistress
in
search
of
the
refuge
and
finally
on
the
threshold
of
the
refuge
the
miracle
was
accomplished
for
the
impure
the
corrupt
the
implacable
enemy
the
rose
of
hell
was
now
suddenly
cleansed
of
all
sin
and
stood
chaste
and
immaculate
ready
to
follow
her
loved
one
to
the
altar
on
the
summit
of
the
high
marble
candelabra
which
had
not
heard
the
voice
of
the
light
for
centuries
she
burned
in
the
inextinguishable
and
silent
flame
of
her
love
erect
on
the
candelabra
in
the
silence
you
will
illuminate
the
meditations
of
my
soul
until
death
she
was
burning
with
an
inner
fire
without
ever
claiming
any
food
for
the
flames
without
ever
asking
anything
from
the
loved
one
in
return
she
renounced
forever
all
possession
higher
in
her
purity
than
god
himself
since
god
loves
his
creatures
but
exacts
from
them
a
reciprocity
of
love
and
becomes
terrible
against
those
who
refuse
to
love
him
her
love
was
stylite
love
sublime
and
solitary
nourishing
itself
with
one
blood
and
one
soul
she
had
felt
fall
around
her
that
part
of
her
substance
which
was
opposed
to
an
entire
offering
nothing
disquieting
or
impure
remained
in
her
her
body
had
been
metamorphosed
into
a
subtle
agile
diaphanous
incorruptible
element
her
senses
had
dissolved
into
one
supreme
and
only
voluptuousness
set
up
on
the
summit
of
the
marvellous
stela
she
burned
up
from
and
enjoyed
her
ardor
and
her
splendor
like
a
flame
conscious
of
its
own
enflamed
existence
hippolyte
listened
intently
and
said
don
t
you
hear
another
procession
is
the
vigil
the
dawns
the
noons
the
twilights
and
the
nights
rang
with
the
religious
chants
one
procession
followed
the
other
in
the
hot
glare
of
the
sun
in
the
silvery
rays
of
the
moon
all
were
emigrating
to
the
same
land
and
were
celebrating
the
same
name
animated
by
the
vehemence
of
a
similar
passion
terrible
and
wretched
in
appearance
deserting
on
the
highroads
the
sick
and
the
dying
without
stopping
prompt
to
throw
down
no
matter
what
obstacle
to
reach
the
place
where
awaited
them
the
balm
for
all
their
ills
the
promise
of
all
their
hopes
they
marched
marched
ceaselessly
obliterating
with
their
own
sweat
their
footprints
in
the
endless
dust
what
an
immense
irradiation
of
strength
that
simple
image
must
possess
to
move
and
allure
all
these
masses
of
heavy
flesh
almost
four
centuries
before
an
old
septuagenarian
in
a
plain
devastated
by
the
hail
thought
he
perceived
the
virgin
of
mercy
in
the
tops
of
a
tree
and
since
then
each
year
on
the
anniversary
of
the
apparition
all
the
peoples
of
the
mountains
and
the
coast
have
gone
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
place
to
beseech
mercy
for
its
sufferings
hippolyte
had
already
heard
the
legend
from
candie
and
for
the
past
few
days
she
had
nourished
a
secret
desire
to
visit
the
sanctuary
the
predominance
of
love
and
the
habit
of
sensual
pleasure
had
banished
all
religious
sentiment
in
her
but
a
roman
of
good
family
and
what
is
more
born
in
the
trastevere
brought
up
in
one
of
those
families
in
which
according
to
immemorial
tradition
the
key
of
the
conscience
is
always
in
the
hands
of
a
priest
she
was
a
strict
catholic
devoted
to
all
the
external
practices
of
the
church
subject
to
periodical
returns
of
exalted
fervor
meanwhile
why
should
we
not
go
to
casalbordino
too
is
the
vigil
let
us
go
we
it
will
be
a
great
sight
for
you
we
ll
take
the
old
man
with
us
george
consented
hippolyte
s
desire
corresponded
with
his
own
he
thought
it
necessary
to
him
to
follow
this
deep
current
to
form
part
of
this
wild
conglomeration
of
men
to
experience
material
contact
with
the
inferior
classes
of
his
race
those
dense
and
immutable
layers
on
which
the
primitive
impressions
had
perhaps
been
preserved
intact
we
ll
start
he
added
seized
by
a
kind
of
anxiety
as
he
heard
the
chant
approaching
hippolyte
told
him
as
related
by
candie
some
of
the
atrocious
tests
to
which
the
pilgrims
had
vowed
to
submit
she
shuddered
with
horror
and
while
the
chant
grew
louder
both
felt
a
tragic
breath
pass
over
their
souls
they
were
on
the
hill
at
night
the
moon
was
high
in
the
sky
a
cool
humidity
extended
over
the
vast
vegetable
masses
still
vibrating
from
the
storm
of
the
afternoon
all
the
leaves
were
weeping
and
these
myriads
of
tears
scintillating
like
diamonds
in
the
moonlight
transfigured
the
forest
as
george
had
accidentally
stumbled
over
the
trunk
of
a
tree
the
luminous
drops
of
the
shaken
branches
fell
on
hippolyte
covering
her
with
constellations
she
gave
a
little
cry
and
began
to
laugh
ah
traitor
she
murmured
convinced
that
george
had
done
it
intentionally
and
she
took
measures
for
reprisals
thus
shaken
the
trees
and
bushes
threw
off
their
liquid
gems
with
a
lively
crepitation
while
hippolyte
s
laughs
resounded
at
intervals
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
george
also
laughed
suddenly
forgetful
of
his
nightmare
permitting
himself
to
be
won
by
the
seduction
of
youth
permitting
himself
to
be
penetrated
by
this
bracing
nocturnal
coolness
in
which
was
distilled
all
the
fragrance
of
the
earth
he
tried
to
reach
first
the
tree
whose
foliage
seemed
most
heavily
laden
with
water
and
she
tried
to
reach
it
before
him
running
courageously
on
the
slippery
declivity
they
almost
always
reached
the
tree
at
the
same
time
and
they
shook
it
together
both
remaining
under
the
shower
in
the
unsteady
shadow
of
the
foliage
the
whiteness
of
hippolyte
s
eyes
and
teeth
assumed
extraordinary
lustre
and
the
tiny
drops
like
diamond
dust
glittered
on
the
pretty
curls
on
her
temples
on
her
cheeks
on
her
lips
even
on
her
eyelashes
trembling
from
her
laughter
ah
you
magician
cried
george
letting
go
of
the
tree
and
seizing
the
woman
who
once
more
appeared
to
him
in
a
mysterious
flash
of
nocturnal
beauty
he
began
to
kiss
her
all
over
her
face
and
to
his
lips
she
was
cool
and
wet
with
dew
like
fruit
just
plucked
from
the
tree
there
there
there
he
imprinted
hearty
resounding
kisses
on
her
mouth
her
cheeks
her
eyes
her
temples
her
neck
as
insatiable
as
if
the
flesh
were
a
novelty
to
him
and
as
she
felt
the
kisses
hippolyte
took
that
almost
ecstatic
attitude
usual
with
her
when
she
felt
that
her
lover
was
in
one
of
his
moments
of
true
intoxication
at
those
times
she
seemed
anxious
to
release
from
the
depths
of
her
own
substance
the
sweetest
and
most
powerful
perfume
of
love
to
excite
george
s
intoxication
to
the
point
of
anguish
there
he
stopped
seized
by
anguish
he
had
reached
the
extreme
limit
of
sensation
and
could
not
go
beyond
they
said
no
more
they
took
each
other
s
hand
they
continued
on
their
way
to
the
hermitage
cutting
across
the
fields
because
in
their
thoughtless
frolic
they
had
wandered
from
the
road
they
felt
now
indefinable
lassitude
and
melancholy
george
seemed
astonished
so
life
unexpectedly
like
a
furtive
gesture
in
the
shadow
had
offered
him
a
new
new
sensation
real
and
profound
at
the
close
of
a
day
full
of
anxiety
spent
in
a
cloister
of
flitting
phantoms
but
was
that
life
was
it
not
rather
dreamland
the
one
is
always
the
shadow
of
the
other
he
thought
there
where
is
life
there
is
dreamland
there
where
is
dreamland
there
is
life
look
interrupted
hippolyte
with
a
start
of
admiration
it
was
as
if
she
illustrated
with
a
picture
the
thought
he
had
not
revealed
in
the
moonlight
a
vine
was
there
silent
the
upright
were
twined
around
the
reeds
like
around
agile
thyrses
and
the
streaming
branches
diaphanous
against
the
luminous
horizon
with
a
thousand
intertwinings
of
their
subtle
ribs
in
the
perfect
immobility
of
mineral
things
and
with
an
appearance
of
indescribably
fragile
and
ephemeral
crystal
had
neither
terrestrial
reality
nor
any
communion
with
the
environing
forms
but
seemed
to
be
the
last
visible
fragment
of
an
allegorical
world
conceived
by
a
theurgy
and
about
to
fade
away
spontaneously
arose
in
george
s
memory
the
verse
of
the
hymn
mea
coram
me
it
should
perhaps
be
mentioned
here
that
the
publication
of
the
triumph
of
death
began
in
the
mattino
of
naples
on
february
while
the
publication
of
émile
zola
s
work
lourdes
only
began
in
the
of
paris
on
april
s
note
since
dawn
train
after
train
had
vomited
immense
waves
of
humanity
on
the
platforms
of
the
casalbordino
station
people
from
the
villages
and
market
towns
mingled
with
fraternities
from
the
most
distant
hamlets
who
had
not
wished
or
been
able
to
make
the
pilgrimage
on
foot
they
precipitated
themselves
in
a
tumult
from
the
carriages
shouting
gesticulating
and
pushing
each
other
to
storm
the
wagons
and
coaches
amid
the
cracking
of
whips
and
the
tinkling
of
bells
or
again
they
fell
into
line
in
long
files
behind
a
crucifix
and
when
their
procession
started
on
the
dusty
road
they
struck
up
the
hymn
already
frightened
by
the
size
of
the
crowd
george
and
hippolyte
turned
instinctively
toward
the
sea
close
by
to
wait
until
the
crowd
dispersed
a
field
of
hemp
undulated
peacefully
before
the
blue
background
of
the
waters
the
sails
shone
like
flames
on
the
clear
horizon
george
said
to
his
companion
aren
t
you
afraid
i
fear
the
fatigue
will
hurt
you
she
replied
do
not
be
alarmed
i
am
strong
besides
to
deserve
a
favor
must
one
not
suffer
a
little
he
replied
smiling
are
you
going
to
ask
a
favor
yes
only
one
but
are
we
not
in
the
state
of
mortal
sin
that
is
true
well
then
i
shall
ask
just
the
same
they
had
brought
with
them
old
colas
who
acquainted
with
the
localities
and
usages
served
them
as
a
guide
as
soon
as
the
door
of
their
compartment
was
disencumbered
they
descended
and
got
into
a
coach
which
started
off
at
a
gallop
with
a
great
tinkling
of
bells
the
horses
were
decorated
and
plumed
like
the
drivers
wore
peacocks
feathers
in
their
hats
and
did
not
cease
flourishing
their
whips
accompanying
the
deafening
cracks
with
hoarse
cries
hippolyte
tormented
by
impatience
and
extraordinary
uneasiness
as
if
this
day
were
to
realize
some
great
event
for
her
asked
the
old
man
how
long
will
it
take
to
get
there
half
an
hour
at
the
most
is
the
church
very
old
no
signora
i
can
still
remember
the
time
when
it
didn
t
exist
fifty
years
ago
there
was
only
a
small
chapel
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
sheet
of
paper
folded
in
four
unfolded
it
and
showed
it
to
george
you
can
read
it
it
s
the
history
of
the
church
it
was
a
picture
with
the
legend
at
the
bottom
the
virgin
in
a
cloud
of
angels
was
seated
on
an
and
an
old
man
was
adoring
her
prostrated
at
the
foot
of
the
trunk
this
old
man
was
named
alexander
muzio
and
this
is
the
story
as
told
by
the
legend
in
the
year
of
our
lord
during
the
evening
of
the
of
june
the
sunday
of
the
pentecost
a
storm
broke
over
the
district
of
casalbordino
and
devastated
the
vines
the
corn
and
the
the
following
morning
an
old
septuagenarian
of
pollutro
alexander
muzio
proprietor
of
a
wheat
field
at
pinno
del
lago
started
on
his
way
to
visit
it
his
heart
sank
at
the
sight
of
the
damaged
crops
but
in
his
profound
humility
he
praised
the
justice
of
god
very
devoted
to
the
holy
virgin
he
was
telling
his
beads
while
walking
when
at
the
end
of
the
valley
he
heard
the
bell
ringing
at
the
elevation
of
the
mass
he
immediately
kneeled
down
and
concentrated
all
his
fervor
for
the
prayer
but
while
he
prayed
he
saw
himself
surrounded
by
a
brilliancy
which
eclipsed
that
of
the
sun
and
in
this
brilliancy
appeared
to
him
the
mother
of
mercy
robed
in
azure
and
she
spoke
to
him
sweetly
go
and
carry
the
news
let
a
temple
be
raised
on
this
spot
and
i
will
distribute
my
favors
here
go
to
thy
field
and
thou
wilt
find
thy
wheat
she
disappeared
with
her
crown
of
angels
and
the
old
man
rose
went
as
far
as
his
field
found
his
wheat
intact
then
he
hastened
to
pollutro
saw
the
curate
mariano
d
iddone
related
to
him
the
prodigy
in
a
few
seconds
the
news
had
spread
all
over
the
casalbordino
district
the
entire
population
ran
to
the
holy
spot
saw
the
dry
soil
around
the
tree
saw
undulate
the
prosperous
harvest
recognized
the
miracle
and
shed
tears
of
penitence
and
feeling
soon
afterwards
the
vicar
of
arabona
laid
the
first
stone
of
a
chapel
and
the
proxies
for
the
edification
were
geronimo
di
geronimo
and
giovanni
fatalone
casalesians
on
the
altar
they
painted
the
virgin
with
the
old
alexander
prostrated
in
the
act
of
adoration
the
legend
was
simple
commonplace
similar
to
a
hundred
others
founded
on
miracle
since
that
first
act
of
mercy
it
was
in
the
name
of
the
virgin
that
ships
were
saved
from
the
tempest
lands
from
the
hail
travellers
from
robbers
sick
people
from
death
placed
amidst
an
unfortunate
people
the
image
was
an
inexhaustible
source
of
salvation
of
all
the
madonnas
in
the
world
ours
is
the
one
who
does
most
good
said
colas
di
sciampagne
kissing
the
sacred
sheet
before
replacing
it
in
his
bosom
they
say
that
another
vision
has
been
seen
in
the
kingdom
but
ours
is
the
best
don
t
be
afraid
she
s
worth
all
the
his
tone
and
his
attitude
displayed
that
sectarian
fanaticism
which
fires
the
blood
of
all
idolaters
and
which
at
times
in
the
region
of
the
abruzzi
impels
populations
to
ferocious
wars
for
the
supremacy
of
an
idol
the
old
man
like
all
his
brothers
in
belief
did
not
conceive
the
divine
being
outside
of
the
painted
image
it
was
in
the
image
that
he
saw
and
adored
the
real
presence
of
the
celestial
personage
the
image
upon
the
altar
for
him
was
a
creature
of
flesh
and
bones
she
breathed
smiled
winked
bowed
her
head
made
gestures
with
her
hand
and
everywhere
it
was
the
same
thing
all
the
sacred
statues
in
wood
wax
bronze
or
silver
lived
a
real
life
in
their
vile
substance
or
precious
metal
when
they
became
old
when
they
broke
or
were
destroyed
in
the
course
of
the
years
they
did
not
give
way
to
new
statues
without
giving
savage
signs
of
their
anger
one
day
a
fragment
of
a
bust
become
unrecognizable
and
confounded
with
firewood
had
splurted
blood
under
the
axe
and
uttered
threatening
words
another
fragment
planed
and
arranged
among
the
staves
of
a
vat
had
manifested
its
supernatural
character
by
causing
the
apparition
in
the
water
of
its
primitive
and
integral
form
hey
there
cried
the
old
man
to
a
pedestrian
who
was
painfully
walking
in
the
suffocating
dust
along
the
curbstone
hey
there
aligi
he
turned
towards
his
guests
adding
with
commiseration

approached
he
was
gasping
bent
over
his
stick
covered
with
dust
bathed
in
perspiration
dazed
by
the
sun
a
collar
of
reddish
beard
surrounded
his
chin
from
one
ear
to
the
other
and
framed
his
face
dotted
with
freckles
locks
of
reddish
hair
emerged
from
under
his
hat
sticking
to
the
forehead
and
temples
his
hollow
eyes
converging
towards
the
base
of
the
nose
of
no
precise
color
recalled
those
of
epileptics
gasping
and
hoarsely
he
said
thanks
god

reward
you
may
the
madonna
protect
you
but
i

he
held
in
his
right
hand
an
object
wrapped
in
a
white
handkerchief
is
that
your
offering
asked
colas
let
us
see
the
man
opened
the
corners
of
the
handkerchief
and
showed
a
waxen
leg
as
livid
as
the
leg
of
a
cadaver
and
on
it
was
painted
a
festering
sore
the
heat
had
softened
it
and
made
it
shiny
as
if
moist
with
sweat
don
t
you
see
it
s
melting
and
colas
stretched
out
his
hand

road
aligi
repeated
i
can

i
made
a
vow
to
go
on
foot
and
not
without
anxiety
he
examined
the
leg
by
raising
it
to
the
level
of
his
oblique
eyes
on
this
scorching
road
amid
this
dust
under
this
great
strong
light
nothing
sadder
could
be
imagined
than
this
emaciated
man
and
that
livid
thing
repugnant
as
an
amputated
limb
which
was
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
a
sore
on
walls
already
covered
by
silent
and
motionless
effigies
of
so
many
infirmities
visited
upon
human
flesh
through
all
the
centuries
hey
there
and
the
horses
resumed
their
trot
after
the
small
hills
were
left
behind
the
road
crossed
a
plain
rich
in
harvests
almost
ripe
the
old
man
with
his
senile
loquaciousness
related
the
episodes

gangrenous
sore

by
the
virgin

hippolyte

she
pointed
to
a

rose
in
the
centre
of
a
great
encumbered
plain
a
few
moments
later
the
carriage
rejoined
the
crowd

it
was
a
marvellous
and
terrible
spectacle
unheard
of
without
resemblance
to
any
conglomeration
ever
seen
before
whether
of
men
or
things
a
so
strange
so
violent
and
incongruous
that
it
exceeded
the
most
troubled
dreams

all
the
ugliness
of
the
eternal

all
the
shameful

all
the
stupors
all

from

exhibited
in
broad
of
everything
was
there
seething
and
fermenting
around
the
house
of
the
virgin
this
house
was
a
massive
red
brick
structure
of
vulgar
architecture
devoid
of
ornamentation
against
the
exterior
walls
against
the
pillars
of
the
portal
peddlers
of
sacred
objects
had
established
their
tents
arranged

by
were
erected
canvas
booths
conical
in
shape
ornamented
with
large
pictures
representing
bloody
battles
and
cannibal
feasts
at
the
entrance
men
of
ignoble
and
equivocal
appearance
trumpeted
and
vociferated
shameless
women
with
enormous
legs
swollen
abdomens
flabby
breasts
clad
in
dirty
tights
and
bespangled
rags
glorified
in
extravagant
jargon
the
marvels
hidden
by
the
red
curtain
behind
them
one
of
these
tattered
ribalds
who
looked
like
a
monster
engendered
by
a
dwarf
and
a
sow
gave
kisses
from
her
sticky
lips
to
a
lascivious
monkey
while
near
her
a
clown
covered
with
powder
and
carmine
struck
an
bell
with
frantic
fury
the
processions
arrived
in
long
files
preceded
by
their
chanting
the
hymn
the
women
held
each
other
by
a
corner
of
their
dresses
and
walked
like
ecstatics
stupefied
their
eyes
wide
open
and
fixed
those
of
trigno
wore
robes
of
scarlet
plush
with
a
thousand
folds
caught
up
in
the
middle
of
the
back
almost
under
the
shoulders
and
crossed
at
the
hips
by
a
multicolored
scarf
which
raised
the
dress
tightened
it
and
formed
a
swelling
like
a
hump
and
as
broken
by
fatigue
they
wended
their
their
limbs
staggering
dragging
shoes
heavy
as
lead
they
had
the
appearance
of
strange
gibbous
animals
many
had
goitres
and
their
golden
necklaces
glistened
beneath

with

displaying
on

acclamations

in

a
young

suddenly
fell
down
struck
by
an
attack
of

his
neighbors
surrounded
him
carried
him
away
from

whirlpool
others
numerous
left
the
mob
which
occupied

esplanade
and
ran
to
see
the

asked
hippolyte
growing
paler
with
an
extraordinary
change
in
her
face
and
voice
nothing
sunstroke
replied
george
taking
her
by
the
arm
and
trying
to
lead
her
away
but
hippolyte
had
understood
she
had
seen
two
men
forcibly
open
the
jaws
of
the
epileptic
and
insert
a
key
in
his
mouth
doubtless
to
prevent
his
biting
his
tongue
and
at
the
thought
she
felt
in
her
own
teeth
that
horrible
grating
and
an
instinctive
shudder
shook
her
to
the
depths
of
her
being
there

sacred
evil

insisted
george
uneasy
dismayed
trying
to
lead
his
companion
elsewhere
what
if
she
were
similarly
taken
all
at
once
he
thought
what
if
the
disease
attacked
her
here
in
the
midst
of
this
crowd
a
chill
ran
through
him
he
recalled
the
letters
dated
from
caronno
those
letters
in
which
she
had
made
the
frightful
revelation
in
hopeless
terms
and
again
as
then
he
imagined
her
hands
pallid
and
shrivelled
and
between
the
fingers
the
curl
of
hair
let
us
go
away
do
you
want
to
enter
the
church
she
remained
silent
stupefied
as
if
by
a
blow
on
the
head
shall
we
enter
repeated
george
shaking
her
and
attempting
to
dissimulate
his
own
anxiety
he
would
have
liked
to
ask
also
of
what
are
you
thinking
but
he
did
not
dare
he
saw
in
hippolyte
s
eyes
such
profound
sadness
that
he
felt
his
heart
oppressed
and
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
then
the
suspicion
that
this
silence
and
stupor
might
be
the
precursors
of
an
imminent
attack
filled
him
with
a
sort
of
panicky
terror
without
reflection
he
stammered
are
you
ill
these
anxious
words
which
were
a
confession
of
his
suspicion
which
revealed
his
secret
fear
increased
still
more
the
trouble
of
the
two
lovers
no
no
she
said
with
a
visible
shudder
benumbed
with
horror
and
pressed
close
to
george
that
he
might
defend
her
from
the
peril
hemmed
in
by
the
mob
dismayed
disgusted
miserable
like
the
others
as
needful
of
pity
and
help
as
the
rest
crushed
like
the
others
beneath
the
weight
of
their
mortal
flesh
both
for
a
moment
felt
in
veritable
communion
with
the
multitude
in
the
midst
of
which
they
trembled
and
suffered
both
for
a
moment
forgot
in
the
immensity
of
human
sorrow
the
limits
of
their
souls
it
was
hippolyte
who
was
the
first
to
turn
towards
the
church
towards
the
great
portal
towards
that
veil
of
bluish
smoke
through
which
by
turns
scintillated
and
disappeared
the
little
flames
of
the
wax
tapers
let
us
go
in
she
said
in
a
choking
voice
without
leaving
george
s
side
colas
remarked
that
it
was
impossible
to
enter
by
the
main
entrance
but
he
added
i
know
another
me
with
great
difficulty
they
forced
a
passage
and
yet
a
false
energy
sustained
them
a
blind
obstinacy
impelled
them
on
almost
like
that
displayed
by
the
fanatics
in
their
endless
turning
they
had
caught
the
contagion
from
now
on
george
no
longer
felt
he
was
master
of
himself
his
nerves
dominated
him
imposed
on
him
the
disorder
and
excess
of
their
sensations
follow
me
repeated
the
old
man
stemming
the
torrent
by
sheer
strength
of
his
elbows
and
struggling
fiercely
to
protect
his
guests
against
the
crush
they
entered
by
a
side
door
into
a
sort
of
sacristy
from
which
could
be
seen
through
a
bluish
smoke
the
walls
entirely
covered
by
votive
offerings
of
wax
suspended
there
in
proof
of
the
miracles
accomplished
by
the
virgin
limbs
arms
hands
feet
breasts
shapeless
pieces
representing
tumors
gangrenes
and
ulcers
horrid
representations
of
monstrous
maladies
pictures
of
violet
and
crimson
sores
which
cried
out
from
the
pallor
of
the
these
objects
motionless
on
the
four
high
walls
had
a
mortuary
appearance
horrifying
and
frightful
evoking
the
image
of
a
where
are
piled
up
all
the
limbs
amputated
in
a
hospital
heaps
of
human
bodies
encumbered
the
pavement
inert
and
in
the
heap
appeared
livid
faces
bleeding
mouths
dusty
faces
bald
heads
white
hair
they
were
nearly
all
old
people
prostrated
by
a
spasm
in
front
of
the
altar
carried
in
arms
and
heaped
in
piles
like
cadavers
in
time
of
a
pest
another
old
man
arrived
from
the
church
carried
in
the
arms
of
two
men
who
were
sobbing
the
motion
caused
his
head
to
hang
now
on
his
chest
now
on
his
shoulder
drops
of
blood
rained
on
his
shirt
front
from
lacerations
of
his
nose
lips
and
chin
behind
him
continued
the
hopeless
cries
of
anguish
imploring
the
favor
which
this
old
man
had
not
obtained
madonna
madonna
madonna
it
was
an
clamor
more
atrocious
than
the
yells
of
a
man
burnt
alive
without
hope
of
salvation
more
terrible
than
the
cry
of
shipwrecked
sailors
condemned
to
a
certain
death
upon
the
nocturnal
sea
madonna
madonna
madonna
a
thousand
arms
were
stretched
towards
the
altar
with
savage
frenzy
the
women
dragged
themselves
along
on
their
knees
sobbing
tearing
out
their
hair
striking
their
hips
bruising
their
foreheads
on
the
stones
twisting
as
if
in
convulsions
or
possessed
many
on
all
fours
sustaining
the
entire
weight
of
their
horizontal
bodies
on
their
elbows
and
naked
toes
advanced
gradually
towards
the
altar
they
crawled
along
like
reptiles
they
gathered
themselves
together
springing
on
their
toes
with
progressive
propulsions
and
beneath
their
petticoats
could
be
seen
their
callous
yellow
soles
the
projecting
and
pointed
of
their
feet
at
times
the
hands
seconded
the
efforts
of
the
elbows
trembling
around
the
mouth
which
kissed
the
dust
near
the
tongue
which
traced
in
this
dust
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
a
saliva
mixed
with
blood
and
the
crawling
bodies
passed
over
these
bloody
tracings
without
effacing
them
whilst
before
each
head
a
man
erect
struck
the
pavement
with
the
tip
of
a
stick
in
order
to
indicate
the
right
way
to
the
altar
madonna
madonna
madonna
kinswomen
dragging
themselves
along
on
their
knees
on
each
side
of
the
furrow
superintended
the
votive
agony
from
time
to
time
they
leaned
forward
to
encourage
their
unfortunate
sisters
when
the
latter
seemed
about
to
faint
they
went
to
their
relief
supported
them
under
the
arms
or
fanned
their
heads
with
a
cloth
while
doing
this
they
shed
hot
tears
and
wept
even
more
copiously
when
they
assisted
the
old
men
or
adolescents
acquitting
themselves
of
the
same
vows
for
there
were
not
only
women
but
also
old
men
adults
adolescents
who
to
approach
the
altar
to
be
worthy
to
lift
their
eyes
towards
the
image
subjected
themselves
to
this
torment
each
placed
his
tongue
on
the
spot
where
another
had
already
left
a
wet
trace
each
struck
his
forehead
or
his
chin
on
the
spot
where
another
had
already
left
a
shred
of
his
skin
a
drop
of
his
blood
of
his
sweat
and
of
his
tears
suddenly
a
long
ray
of
sunlight
penetrated
the
large
portal
into
the
interstices
of
the
crowd
illuminating
the
soles
of
the
shrunken
feet
calloused
by
the
arid
soil
or
mountainous
rocks
so
deformed
that
they
appeared
less
the
feet
of
human
beings
than
the
feet
of
beasts
illuminating
bald
and
hairy
heads
white
with
old
age
or
light
brown
or
black
supported
by
necks
which
swelled
in
the
effort
or
shaking
and
weak
like
the
greenish
head
of
an
old
turtle
out
of
his
shell
or
like
a
disinterred
skull
still
bearing
a
few
grayish
locks
and
a
few
shreds
of
reddish
skin
now
and
then
over
this
swarm
of
reptiles
a
blue
wave
of
incense
spread
slowly
veiling
for
a
moment
this
humility
this
hope
and
this
bodily
pain
as
if
in
compassion
new
patients
forced
a
passage
presented
themselves
at
the
altar
to
solicit
the
miracle
and
their
shadows
and
their
voices
covered
the
prostrate
bodies
that
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
be
able
to
rise
madonna
madonna
madonna
the
mothers
exposed
their
breasts
which
they
showed
to
the
virgin
imploring
the
blessing
of
milk
while
behind
them
their
kinswomen
carried
the
emaciated
children
almost
dying
who
uttered
wailing
cries
wives
prayed
for
the
fecundity
of
their
sterile
womb
and
gave
as
offerings
their
clothes
and
marriage
jewels
holy
virgin
have
mercy
on
me
in
the
name
of
the
son
whom
thou
dost
bear
in
thine
arms
they
prayed
at
first
in
low
tones
tearfully
reciting
their
woes
as
if
they
were
having
a
secret
conversation
with
the
image
as
if
the
image
were
bending
forward
from
above
to
listen
to
their
lamentations
then
gradually
they
exalted
themselves
almost
to
the
point
of
fury
insanity
as
if
they
wished
by
their
acclamations
and
insane
gestures
to
compel
consent
to
the
prodigy
they
summoned
all
their
energy
to
utter
a
superhuman
shriek
capable
of
reaching
the
very
bottom
of
the
virgin
s
heart
have
mercy
on
us
have
mercy
on
us
and
they
stopped
staring
anxiously
with
their
dilated
and
fixed
eyes
in
the
hope
of
surprising
finally
a
sign
upon
the
visage
of
the
celestial
person
who
scintillated
in
a
reflection
of
jewels
between
the
columns
of
the
inaccessible
altar
another
wave
of
fanatics
arrived
took
their
places
spread
out
along
the
entire
length
of
the
railing
tumultuous
cries
and
violent
gestures
alternated
with
their
offerings
inside
the
railing
which
intercepted
the
access
to
the
large
altar
priests
received
in
their
fat
and
white
hands
the
moneys
and
trinkets
in
the
act
of
tendering
the
right
or
left
hand
on
either
side
they
balanced
themselves
like
caged
beasts
in
a
menagerie
behind
them
the
clerks
held
large
metal
plates
on
which
the
offerings
jinglingly
accumulated
on
one
side
near
the
door
of
the
sacristy
other
priests
were
stooping
over
a
table
they
were
counting
the
money
and
examining
the
jewels
while
one
of
them
bony
and
brownish
made
entries
with
a
quill
pen
in
a
large
ledger
they
each
performed
this
task
in
turn
and
then
left
it
to
officiate
from
time
to
time
the
bell
sounded
and
the
censer
was
elevated
amidst
a
cloud
of
smoke
long
bluish
waves
rolled
around
the
tonsured
heads
and
dispersed
on
the
other
side
of
the
railing
the
sacred
perfume
mingled
with
the
human
stench
pro
nobis
sancta
dei
genitrix
digni
efficiamur
promissionibus
at
times
during
unexpected
and
terrible
pauses
like
those
of
a
hurricane
when
the
crowd
was
oppressed
by
the
anguish
of
expectation
one
could
distinctly
hear
the
latin
words
nos
famulos
beneath
the
large
portal
advanced
with
pomp
a
married
couple
escorted
by
all
their
relatives
in
a
blaze
of
gold
in
a
rustling
of
silk
the
spouse
young
and
vigorous
had
a
head
like
a
barbarian
queen
with
thick
and
joining
eyebrows
wavy
and
shining
black
hair
a
fleshy
and
mouth
in
which
the
incisive
irregular
teeth
raised
the
upper
lip
shaded
with
a
virile
shadow
a
necklace
of
large
gold
beads
was
wound
thrice
around
her
neck
large
gold
hoops
embellished
with
filigree
work
hung
from
her
ears
on
her
cheeks
a
corsage
scintillating
like
a
coat
of
mail
confined
her
bosom
she
marched
gravely
entirely
absorbed
in
her
thoughts
scarcely
winking
her
eyelids
holding
her
ringed
hand
on
her
husband
s
shoulder
the
husband
was
also
young
of
medium
stature
almost
beardless
very
pale
and
with
an
expression
of
profound
sadness
as
if
devoured
by
a
sad
secret
the
appearance
of
both
seemed
to
indicate
the
fatality
of
a
primitive
mystery
whispers
spread
around
their
passage
they
themselves
neither
spoke
nor
turned
their
heads
followed
by
their
parents
men
and
women
entwined
in
a
chain
by
their
arms
as
if
about
to
perform
an
ancient
dance
what
vow
were
they
accomplishing
what
favors
were
they
asking
the
news
spread
in
a
low
tone
from
mouth
to
mouth
they
asked
for
the
young
man
a
return
of
genital
virility
of
which
some
evil
influence
doubtless
had
deprived
him
the
virginity
of
his
spouse
still
remained
intact
the
conjugal
couch
was
still
immaculate
when
they
were
near
to
the
railing
they
both
raised
their
eyes
toward
the
image
silently
and
they
remained
a
few
moments
motionless
absorbed
in
the
same
mute
supplication
but
behind
them
the
two
mothers
extended
their
arms
agitated
their
dried
and
wrinkled
hands
which
on
the
marriage
day
had
distributed
in
vain
the
augural
grain
they
stretched
out
their
arms
and
cried
madonna
madonna
madonna
with
slow
gestures
the
wife
removed
the
rings
from
her
fingers
and
offered
them
then
she
took
out
the
heavy
golden
hoops
then
she
took
off
her
hereditary
necklace
all
this
wealth
she
offered
at
the
altar
take
it
blessed
virgin
take
it
most
holy
mary
of
miracles
cried
the
mothers
with
voices
already
rendered
hoarse
by
their
cries
with
demonstrations
redoubled
by
fervor
each
glancing
at
the
other
sidewise
to
see
that
her
neighbor
was
not
surpassing
her
in
ardor
in
the
eyes
of
the
attentive
crowd
take
it
take
it
they
saw
the
gold
fall
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
impassive
priest
then
they
heard
the
precious
metal
jingle
on
the
clerk
s
plate
coin
acquired
by
dint
of
the
persistent
toil
of
several
generations
preserved
for
years
and
years
at
the
bottom
of
the
strong
box
and
brought
to
light
again
at
every
new
they
beheld
fall
the
family
wealth
fall
disappear
forever
the
immensity
of
the
sacrifice
plunged
them
into
despair
and
their
distress
extended
to
their
kinsmen
the
relatives
ended
by
uttering
piercing
shrieks
altogether
the
young
man
alone
remained
silent
keeping
constantly
fixed
on
the
image
his
eyes
from
which
gushed
two
streams
of
silent
tears
then
there
was
a
pause
during
which
one
could
hear
the
latin
words
of
the
service
and
the
cadence
chanted
by
the
processions
which
were
still
turning
around
the
church
then
the
couple
resumed
their
first
position
and
their
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
image
slowly
fell
back
a
new
band
yelling
furiously
now
interposed
between
them
and
the
railing
for
a
few
seconds
the
young
woman
towered
a
head
above
the
tumult
despoiled
now
of
all
her
bridal
jewelry
but
more
beautiful
and
more
vigorous
enveloped
in
a
sort
of
dionysiac
mystery
exhaling
over
this
barbaric
multitude
a
breath
as
of
very
ancient
life
and
she
disappeared
never
to
be
forgotten
exalted
far
beyond
the
time
and
the
reality
george
s
gaze
followed
her
until
she
disappeared
his
soul
lived
in
the
horror
of
an
unknown
world
in
the
presence
of
a
nameless
people
associated
with
rites
of
very
obscure
origin
the
faces
of
men
and
women
appeared
to
him
as
if
in
a
delirious
vision
marked
with
the
stamp
of
a
humanity
other
than
his
own
and
formed
of
a
different
substance
and
the
looks
the
motions
and
the
voices
and
all
the
perceptible
signs
struck
him
with
stupor
as
if
they
had
had
no
analogy
with
the
habitual
human
expressions
which
he
had
known
up
to
then
certain
figures
exercised
over
him
a
sudden
magnetic
attraction
he
followed
them
in
the
crowd
dragging
hippolyte
with
him
he
gazed
after
them
on
tiptoe
he
watched
all
their
actions
he
felt
their
cries
reverberate
in
his
own
heart
he
felt
himself
invaded
by
the
same
madness
he
himself
felt
a
brutal
desire
to
shout
and
gesticulate
from
time
to
time
hippolyte
and
he
glanced
at
each
other
they
saw
each
other
pale
convulsed
aghast
exhausted
but
neither
one
proposed
to
leave
the
terrible
place
as
if
they
lacked
the
strength
to
do
so
jostled
by
the
mob
almost
carried
away
at
times
they
wandered
here
and
there
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
holding
hands
or
arms
while
the
old
man
made
continuous
efforts
to
help
and
protect
them
a
procession
coming
up
forced
them
against
the
railing
during
several
minutes
they
remained
there
prisoners
closed
in
on
all
sides
enveloped
by
the
smoke
of
the
incense
deafened
by
the
cries
suffocated
by
the
heat
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
gesticulating
and
insanity
madonna
madonna
madonna
it
was
the
reptile
women
who
arrived
at
last
rose
to
their
feet
one
among
them
was
carried
by
her
relatives
rigid
as
a
corpse
they
stood
her
on
her
feet
they
shook
her
she
seemed
dead
her
face
was
all
dusty
the
skin
flayed
from
her
nose
and
forehead
her
mouth
full
of
blood
those
who
helped
her
blew
in
her
face
to
bring
her
back
to
consciousness
wiped
her
mouth
with
a
cloth
which
became
crimson
shook
her
again
and
called
her
by
name
all
at
once
her
head
fell
back
then
she
threw
herself
against
the
railing
grasped
the
iron
bars
stiffened
her
whole
body
and
began
to
scream
like
a
woman
in
delivery
she
yelled
and
struggled
drowning
every
other
clamor
a
torrent
of
tears
inundated
her
face
washing
off
the
dust
and
blood
madonna
madonna
madonna
and
behind
her
by
her
sides
other
women
surged
tottered
reanimated
themselves
implored
mercy
mercy
they
lost
their
voices
grew
pale
broke
down
heavily
and
were
carried
away
inert
masses
while
others
again
seemed
to
surge
up
from
below
ground
mercy
mercy
these
shrieks
which
rent
the
breasts
that
emitted
them
these
syllables
repeated
without
cease
with
the
persistence
of
the
same
unconquerable
faith
this
thick
smoke
which
overhung
like
the
cloud
of
a
tempest
this
contact
of
bodies
this
mixture
of
breaths
the
sight
of
this
blood
and
these
this
made
that
at
one
moment
the
entire
multitude
found
itself
possessed
by
a
single
soul
became
a
single
being
miserable
and
terrible
having
but
one
gesture
but
one
voice
but
one
convulsion
but
one
frenzy
all
the
evils
melted
into
one
single
evil
which
the
virgin
should
destroy
all
the
hopes
melted
into
one
single
hope
which
the
virgin
should
grant
mercy
mercy
and
beneath
the
scintillating
image
the
little
flames
of
the
waxen
tapers
trembled
before
this
wind
of
passion
vii
george
and
hippolyte
were
now
seated
in
the
open
air
away
from
the
turmoil
beneath
the
trees
stupefied
and
faint
like
two
shipwrecked
people
escaped
from
peril
mute
almost
without
power
of
thought
although
from
time
to
time
a
shudder
at
the
recent
horror
again
ran
through
them
hippolyte
s
eyes
were
red
from
crying
both
in
the
sanctuary
at
the
tragic
moment
had
been
seized
by
a
common
delirium
and
from
fear
of
madness
they
had
taken
flight
they
were
now
seated
away
from
the
turmoil
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
esplanade
beneath
the
trees
this
corner
was
almost
deserted
one
only
saw
there
around
several
twisted
trunks
groups
of
beasts
of
burden
with
empty
in
an
immobility
of
lifeless
forms
and
they
cast
a
sad
aspect
over
the
shade
of
the
trees
in
the
distance
could
be
heard
the
murmur
of
the
swarming
multitude
one
heard
the
cadences
of
the
sacred
chants
the
blasts
of
the
trumpets
the
ringing
of
the
bells
one
perceived
the
pilgrimages
developing
into
long
files
turning
around
the
church
entering
it
and
leaving
it
do
you
want
to
sleep
asked
george
who
noticed
that
hippolyte
was
closing
her
eyes
no
but
i
have
no
longer
the
courage
to
george
felt
the
same
repugnance
the
continuity
and
acuteness
of
the
sensations
had
overcome
the
resistance
of
his
organs
the
spectacle
had
become
intolerable
he
arose
come
get
up
he
said
let
us
go
and
sit
down
farther
off
they
descended
into
a
cultivated
valley
seeking
a
little
shade
the
sun
was
very
ardent
both
thought
of
their
house
at
san
vito
of
the
beautiful
airy
rooms
opening
on
the
sea
are
you
suffering
much
asked
george
discovering
on
his
friend
s
face
the
manifest
signs
of
pain
and
in
her
eyes
the
sombre
sadness
that
lately
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
near
the
pillar
of
the
portal
had
already
frightened
him
no
i
am
very
tired
do
you
want
to
sleep
why
not
sleep
a
little
lean
against
me
afterwards
you
will
feel
better
will
you
no
no
lean
against
me
we
will
wait
until
colas
returns
before
we
go
to
casalbordino
meanwhile
rest
a
little
she
removed
her
hat
bent
towards
him
and
leaned
her
head
he
looked
at
her
in
this
attitude
how
beautiful
you
are
he
said
she
smiled
once
more
the
suffering
transfigured
her
gave
her
greater
seductive
charm
he
said
again
how
long
it
is
since
you
gave
me
a
kiss
they
embraced
now
sleep
a
little
he
begged
tenderly
his
sentiment
of
love
seemed
renewed
in
him
after
so
many
horrible
and
strange
things
that
had
oppressed
them
he
began
once
more
to
isolate
himself
to
recoil
within
himself
to
repulse
all
communion
that
was
not
with
the
elect
of
his
heart
his
mind
freed
itself
with
an
inconceivable
rapidity
from
all
the
phantoms
created
during
the
period
of
the
mystic
illusion
the
ascetic
ideal
he
threw
off
the
yoke
of
that
divine
which
he
had
tried
to
substitute
for
his
inert
will
from
the
very
hopelessness
of
arousing
it
he
now
felt
for
faith
the
same
disgust
that
he
had
felt
in
the
church
for
the
unclean
beasts
that
crawled
in
the
sacred
dust
he
saw
again
the
fat
and
pale
hands
of
the
priests
who
received
the
offerings
the
continual
balancing
of
the
black
figures
behind
the
closed
railing
all
that
was
ignoble
denied
the
presence
of
that
lord
whom
he
had
hoped
to
know
in
an
annihilating
revelation
but
finally
the
great
proof
had
been
accomplished
he
had
experienced
the
material
contact
with
the
inferior
classes
of
his
race
and
nothing
had
resulted
from
it
for
him
but
a
sentiment
of
invincible
horror
his
being
had
no
roots
in
that
ground
could
have
nothing
in
common
with
that
multitude
which
like
most
species
of
animals
had
attained
its
definite
type
had
definitely
incarnated
in
its
brutish
flesh
permanency
of
habit
for
how
many
centuries
during
how
many
generations
had
this
immutable
type
been
perpetuated
so
the
human
species
had
an
absolutely
inert
basis
which
persisted
beneath
the
undulations
of
moving
superior
elements
so
the
ideal
type
of
humanity
was
not
in
a
distant
future
at
the
unknown
end
of
a
progressive
evolution
it
could
only
manifest
itself
on
the
crest
of
the
waves
in
the
most
elevated
beings
he
perceived
now
that
in
trying
to
find
himself
entirely
and
to
recognize
his
veritable
essence
by
means
of
an
immediate
contact
with
the
race
from
which
he
had
sprung
he
deceived
himself
like
a
man
who
attempts
to
determine
the
form
dimension
direction
speed
and
power
of
a
sea
wave
by
the
action
of
the
subjacent
volume
of
water
the
experiment
had
not
succeeded
he
was
as
much
a
stranger
to
this
multitude
as
to
a
tribe
of
oceanians
he
was
as
much
a
stranger
to
his
country
to
the
land
of
his
birth
to
his
fatherland
as
he
was
to
his
family
and
to
his
hearth
he
should
forever
renounce
that
vain
search
for
the
fixed
state
the
stable
support
the
assured
help
the
sensation
i
have
of
my
being
resembles
that
which
a
man
would
have
who
condemned
to
hold
himself
upright
on
a
ceaselessly
oscillating
and
unbalanced
surface
would
feel
his
support
ceaselessly
fail
him
no
matter
where
he
placed
his
foot
he
had
used
this
vision
once
to
paint
his
perpetual
anxiety
but
why
since
he
wished
to
preserve
life
did
he
not
become
by
dint
of
method
sufficiently
strong
and
agile
to
become
habituated
to
preserving
his
equilibrium
amid
the
diverse
impulsions
and
to
dance
even
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
freely
and
boldly
in
truth
he
wished
to
life
what
proved
that
as
far
as
evidence
could
was
his
successive
experiments
themselves
in
him
a
deep
instinct
resting
intact
up
to
then
arose
with
ever
new
artifices
against
mortal
languor
that
ascetic
dream
which
he
had
constructed
with
such
richness
trimmed
with
such
elegance
was
it
anything
else
than
an
expedient
for
combating
death
he
himself
since
the
beginning
had
set
himself
the
dilemma
either
to
follow
the
example
of
demetrius
or
to
give
himself
to
heaven
he
had
chosen
heaven
to
preserve
his
life
apply
henceforth
your
mind
to
acquire
the
disgust
of
truth
and
certitude
if
you
wish
to
live
renounce
searching
experience
respect
the
veils
believe
in
the
visible
line
and
in
the
proffered
word
do
not
seek
beyond
the
world
any
of
the
appearances
that
your
marvellous
senses
have
created
adore
the
illusion
and
he
already
found
a
charm
in
this
fleeting
hour
the
profundity
of
his
conscience
and
the
infinite
extension
of
his
sensibility
filled
him
with
pride
the
innumerable
phenomena
that
instant
by
instant
succeeded
one
another
in
his
inner
world
made
the
comprehensive
power
of
his
soul
appear
to
be
illimitable
and
that
fleeting
hour
during
which
he
believed
he
could
discover
hidden
connections
and
secret
analogies
between
the
representations
of
chance
and
his
own
sentiment
possessed
in
reality
a
singular
charm
for
him
in
the
distance
could
be
heard
the
confused
murmur
of
the
wild
crowd
from
which
he
had
just
extricated
himself
and
that
confused
murmur
aroused
in
him
in
flashes
the
vision
of
a
great
sinister
furnace
in
which
demons
were
struggling
in
a
tragic
combat
and
above
this
incessant
murmur
he
distinguished
also
at
every
breath
of
the
breeze
the
delicious
rustling
of
the
branches
that
shielded
his
meditation
and
hippolyte
s
repose
hippolyte
was
resting
in
a
doze
her
mouth
scarcely
breathing
and
a
light
moisture
dampened
her
brow
her
hands
were
folded
in
her
lap
ungloved
pale
and
in
imagination
george
saw
between
the
fingers
the
tuft
of
hair
just
as
this
tuft
of
hair
appeared
and
disappeared
in
the
strong
light
on
the
burning
soil
appeared
also
the
phantom
of
the
epileptic
he
who
had
unexpectedly
fallen
at
the
doorway
writhing
beneath
the
grasp
of
two
men
who
were
trying
to
force
open
and
place
a
key
in
his
mouth
this
phantom
appeared
and
disappeared
as
if
it
were
the
dream
of
the
sleeping
woman
and
rendered
visible
what
if
she
awoke
and
the
epilepsy
returned
thought
george
with
an
inner
shudder
the
image
that
forms
in
my
brain
is
perhaps
transmitted
to
me
from
her
i
see
perhaps
her
dream
and
her
dream
is
perhaps
caused
by
an
organic
disturbance
that
commences
and
will
increase
as
far
as
an
attack
is
not
a
dream
sometimes
the
presage
of
a
malady
that
is
breeding
he
dwelt
for
a
long
time
in
the
meditation
of
these
mysteries
of
the
animal
substance
vaguely
perceived
against
the
diffuse
depths
of
this
physical
sensibility
already
enlightened
by
the
five
superior
senses
gradually
appeared
other
intermediary
senses
whose
very
subtle
perceptions
disclosed
to
him
a
world
up
to
then
unknown
was
it
impossible
that
hippolyte
s
latent
malady
furnished
him
with
a
condition
favorable
for
communicating
with
her
in
some
extraordinary
manner
he
regarded
her
attentively
as
he
had
done
in
bed
on
that
first
day
already
so
distant
he
saw
the
light
shadows
of
the
hanging
branches
tremble
on
her
face
he
heard
the
continual
tumult
that
spread
out
from
the
sanctuary
in
the
infinite
light
sadness
again
fell
on
his
heart
lassitude
crushed
him
to
earth
again
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
closed
his
eyes
without
thinking
of
anything
slumber
was
about
to
seize
him
when
a
start
of
hippolyte
awoke
him
george
she
awoke
frightened
agitated
no
longer
recognizing
the
surrounding
spot
the
strong
light
annoyed
her
and
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
groaning
my
god
how
i
m
suffering
she
complained
of
a
pain
in
her
temples
where
are
we
oh
what
an
awful
dream
it
was
i
should
not
have
brought
you
said
george
uneasy
how
sorry
i
am
i
have
not
strength
enough
to
rise
help
me
he
raised
her
up
by
the
arms
she
tottered
and
seized
by
vertigo
clung
to
him
what
s
the
matter
where
do
you
suffer
he
cried
in
a
changed
voice
seized
by
a
panicky
terror
believing
that
she
was
about
to
be
taken
with
a
fit
there
in
the
open
country
far
from
all
help
what
s
the
matter
what
s
the
matter
he
clasped
her
closely
to
him
pressing
her
to
his
heart
which
beat
with
horrible
violence
no
no
it
is
nothing
stammered
hippolyte
who
had
all
at
once
understood
his
terror
and
who
had
grown
pale
it
is
nothing
my
head
is
giddy
the
sun
has
made
me
dizzy
it
is
nothing
her
lips
were
almost
white
and
she
avoided
looking
her
lover
in
the
eyes
he
could
not
yet
succeed
in
dominating
his
anguish
and
poignantly
regretted
having
awakened
in
her
the
fearful
and
shameful
preoccupation
his
memory
recalled
this
passage
in
a
letter
what
if
the
malady
should
seize
me
while
in
your
arms
no
no
i
will
never
see
you
again
i
do
not
wish
to
see
you
any
more
she
said
in
a
feeble
voice
it
s
over
i
m
better
but
i
m
thirsty
where
can
i
get
a
drink
over
there
near
the
church
where
the
tents
are
said
george
she
refused
vigorously
with
a
motion
of
her
head
i
will
go
wait
for
me
here
she
was
obstinate
in
her
refusal
let
us
send
colas
he
must
be
near
by
i
ll
call
him
yes
call
him
so
we
may
return
to
casalbordino
i
will
drink
there
i
can
wait
let
us
go
she
leaned
on
george
s
arm
they
remounted
the
hill
arrived
at
the
top
they
saw
once
more
the
plain
swarming
with
people
the
white
huts
the
reddish
edifice
around
the
twisted
trunks
of
the
still
stood
ever
motionless
the
melancholy
forms
of
the
beasts
of
burden
near
them
in
the
same
shade
where
they
had
previously
sought
a
refuge
an
old
woman
was
seated
who
to
all
appearances
seemed
to
be
a
centenarian
she
also
was
motionless
her
hands
placed
on
her
knees
the
fleshless
limbs
only
partly
covered
by
her
petticoat
her
white
hair
hung
down
the
sides
of
her
waxen
cheeks
the
mouth
without
lips
resembled
a
deep
furrow
her
eyes
were
sealed
forever
beneath
the
corroded
eyelids
her
entire
air
expressed
a
reminiscence
of
innumerable
pains
is
she
dead
asked
hippolyte
in
a
whisper
stopping
seized
by
fear
and
respect
the
multitude
was
pushing
about
the
sanctuary
the
processions
whirled
around
chanting
beneath
the
cruel
sun
one
of
these
processions
came
from
under
the
great
portal
and
turned
towards
the
open
space
preceded
by
its
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
esplanade
men
and
women
stopped
and
turned
towards
the
church
in
a
the
women
squatting
the
men
upright
the
in
the
centre
they
prayed
and
crossed
themselves
then
they
sent
towards
the
church
a
great
simultaneous
last
salutation
and
they
resumed
then
way
intoning
the
hymn
maria
maria
the
old
woman
did
not
change
her
attitude
something
great
terrible
and
indefinitely
supernatural
emanated
from
her
solitary
old
age
in
the
shadow
of
the
arid
and
almost
petrified
whose
cleft
trunk
seemed
marked
by
a
bolt
from
heaven
if
she
still
lived
her
eyes
at
least
did
not
see
her
ears
no
longer
heard
all
her
senses
were
obliterated
yet
she
had
the
appearance
of
a
witness
who
was
looking
towards
the
invisible
region
of
eternity
death
is
not
as
mysterious
as
this
remnant
of
life
in
this
human
ruin
thought
george
and
at
the
same
time
there
arose
in
his
mind
accompanied
by
an
extraordinary
emotion
the
vague
image
of
a
very
ancient
myth
dost
thou
not
awaken
the
mother
secular
who
sleeps
on
the
threshold
of
death
in
her
slumber
resides
the
first
science
why
dost
thou
not
interrogate
the
wise
earthly
mother
vague
words
the
obscure
fragments
of
ancient
epics
awoke
in
his
memory
indefinite
lines
and
symbols
swayed
and
enveloped
him
let
us
go
george
said
hippolyte
shaking
him
lightly
after
an
interval
of
pensive
silence
how
sad
everything
is
here
her
voice
was
weak
and
in
her
eyes
was
that
sad
shadow
in
which
her
lover
read
an
inexpressible
horror
and
disgust
he
dared
not
encourage
her
for
fear
she
would
feel
in
his
encouragements
the
preoccupation
of
the
horrible
menace
that
seemed
to
hang
over
her
since
the
moment
that
she
had
seen
the
epileptic
fall
in
the
crowd
but
a
few
steps
farther
on
she
stopped
again
choked
by
incoercible
anguish
strangled
by
a
knot
of
sobs
that
she
could
not
untie
she
looked
at
her
lover
then
gazed
about
her
distracted
my
god
my
god
what
sorrow
it
was
a
sorrow
entirely
corporeal
a
brutal
sorrow
that
arose
from
the
depths
of
her
being
like
a
compact
and
heavy
thing
crushing
her
with
an
insupportable
weight
she
would
have
liked
to
sink
to
the
ground
as
if
beneath
an
enormous
burden
never
to
arise
again
she
would
have
liked
to
lose
consciousness
to
become
an
inert
mass
to
expire
tell
me
tell
me
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
do
to
ease
you
stammered
george
pressing
her
hand
prey
to
a
mad
terror
was
not
this
sadness
perhaps
the
chrysalis
of
the
illness
for
a
few
seconds
she
remained
with
her
eyes
fixed
and
rather
haggard
she
shivered
beneath
the
shock
caused
by
the
clamor
raised
in
the
vicinity
by
a
procession
which
saluted
the
church
on
leaving
take
me
away
somewhere
perhaps
there
is
a
hotel
at
casalbordino
where
can
colas
be
george
looked
anxiously
around
in
the
hope
of
discovering
the
old
man
he
said
perhaps
he
is
looking
for
us
in
the
crowd
or
perhaps
he
has
gone
to
casalbordino
thinking
he
will
find
us
there
let
us
go
alone
then
down
below
yonder
i
see
some
carriages
let
us
go
if
you
like
but
lean
on
me
they
directed
their
steps
towards
the
highroad
which
lay
like
a
long
white
ribbon
on
the
other
side
of
the
esplanade
it
seemed
as
if
the
tumult
followed
them
the
trumpet

a
beggar
unexpectedly
appeared
as
if
he
had
sprung
from
below
ground
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
charity
for
the
love
of
the
madonna
it
was
a
young
man
with
his
head
bound
in
a
red
handkerchief
one
corner
of
which
covered
his
eye
he
raised
this
corner
and
showed
an
enormous
eye
swollen
like
a
pocket
purulent
on
which
the
winking
of
the
upper
eyelids
forced
a
shudder
horrible
to
see
charity
for
the
love
of
the
madonna
george
gave
him
money
and
the
beggar
again
hid
his
deformity
but
a
little
farther
on
a
man
of
gigantic
stature
with
an
empty
sleeve
his
shirt
in
order
to
show
the
red
and
furrowed
cicatrice
of
the
amputation
a
horse
s
bite
look
and
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
thus
uncovered
and
he
kissed
the
ground
several
times
crying
each
time
in
a
harsh
voice
for
pity
s
sake
under
a
tree
was
another
beggar
a
fellow
on
a
kind
of
seat
composed
of
a
a
an
empty
petroleum
can
and
large
stones
wrapped
in
a
sordid
covering
from
which
protruded
two
hairy
legs
soiled
with
dry
mud
he
wildly
shook
his
hand
twisted
like
a
root
to
chase
away
the
flies
that
assailed
him
in
clouds
charity

the
madonna
will
pardon
you
have
pity
on
a
poor
man
at
the
sight
of
other
beggars
who
came
running
up
hippolyte
hastened
her
steps
george
made
a
sign
to
the
nearest
coachman
when
they
were
in
the
carriage
hippolyte
uttered
a
cry
of
relief
at
last
george
questioned
the
coachman
is
there
a
hotel
at
casalbordino
yes
signor
there
is
one
how
long
will
it
take
to
get
there
a
short
let
us
go
on
then
he
took
hippolyte
s
hands
tried
to
cheer
her
up
courage
courage
we
will
take
a
room

can
rest
we
will
see
nothing

more
i
too
am
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
my
head
feels
tired
he
added
smiling
aren
t
you
a
little
hungry
she
responded
to
his
smile
he
added
again
evoking
the
remembrance
of
the
old
hotel
of
ludovic
togni
it
will
be
as
it
was
at
albano
do
you
remember
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
becoming
a
little
calmer
he
wanted
to
bring
her
to
a
state
of
light
and
joyous
thoughts
he
said
what
has
become
of
pancrace
ah
if
we
had
one
of
his
oranges
do
you
remember
i
do
not
know
what
i
would
give
for
an
orange
are
you
very
thirsty
are
you
suffering
no
i
feel
better
i
can
hardly
believe
that
the
torture
is
over
my
god
i
shall
never
forget
this
day
poor
soul
he
tenderly
kissed
her
hands
then
pointing
to
the
vegetation
that
bordered
the
road
look
he
exclaimed
see
how
beautiful
the
corn
is
let
us
purify
our
eyes
to
right
and
left
the
harvest
stretched
immaculate
already
ripe
for
the
sickle
high
and
vigorous
breathing
in
the
light
by
the
slender
points
of
their
innumerable
ears
that
at
certain
moments
seemed
to
wave
and
become
converted
into
a
volatile
gold
alone
beneath
the
limpid
arch
of
heaven
they
exhaled
a
spirit
of
purity
by
which
both
their
hearts
sad
and
tired
were
refreshed
how
strong
the
reflection
is
said
hippolyte
half
lowering
her
long
lashes
you
have
your
curtains
she
smiled
it
seemed
that
the
shadow
of
her
sadness
was
about
to
be
dissipated
many
carriages
came
in
a
long
line
from
the
opposite
direction
descending
towards
the
sanctuary
for
a
few
minutes
the
road
the

the

all
disappeared

through

appeared
confusedly
a
growling
mob
of
monsters
one
shook
the
stumps
of
his
amputated
hands
bleeding
as
if
the
mutilation
were
fresh
or
badly
cicatrized
another
had
on
his
palms
disks
of
leather
that
he
used
painfully
to
drag
along

had
an
enormous
goitre
wrinkled
and
that
dangled
like

another
on

on

seemed
to

the

another
displayed
a
face
devastated
by
a
deep
erosion
that
showed
his
nasal
cavities

exhibited
similar

george
sought
for
some

in
his

in

hippolyte
pressed
close
to
him
seized
at
the
throat
by
a
feeling
of
disgust
powerless
henceforth
to
master
the
fantastic
terror
which
invaded
her
in
this
powerful

lugubrious

the
coachman
becoming
angry
rose
suddenly
on
his
seat
shook
his
whip
vigorously
and
began
to
beat
the
beggars
with
all
his
might
and
he
accompanied
every
blow
with
invectives
the
lash
whistled
beneath
his
blows
the
beggars
howled
maledictions
but
did
not
retreat
each
wished

then
george
threw
a
handful
of
coins
in
the
dust
and
the
dust
covered
the
scuffle
of
the
monsters
choked
their
blasphemies
the
man
with

amputated

the

with

stopped

supreme
clamor
that
issued
from
the
entrails
of
the
multitude
confounded
in
an
unique
anguish

in

unique
nothing
was

terrible

the

the

with

dominated
by
the
superstitious
idea
of
a
divine
punishment
fearing
other
spectacles
and
more
atrocious
ones

burning

then
never
end
in
the
light
the
glaring
and
implacable
light
advanced
towards
them
a
band
of
tattered
men
and
women
and
in
front
of
the
band
marched
a
sort
of
crier
who
vociferated
while
agitating
a
copper
tray
these
men
and
women
bore
upon
their
shoulders
a
trestle
covered
with
a
mattress
on
which
lay
an
invalid
of
cadaverous
appearance
a
creature
thin
as
a
skeleton
tightly
wrapped
in
bands
of
cloth
like
a
mummy
the
feet
bare
and
the
and
serpentine
man
with
the
eyes
of
a
to
the
dying
woman
and
related
in
a
high
key
that
this
woman
who
had
been
ill
from
hemorrhage
for
years
had
obtained
the
miracle
from
the
virgin
at
the
very
dawn
of
that
day
and
he
begged
for
alms
so
that
cured
of
her
disease
she
could
gain
fresh
blood
and
he
shook
the
copper
tray
on
which
tinkled
a
few
coins
the
madonna
has
performed
the
miracle

miracle
the
miracle

in
the

very
holy

the
men
the
women
all
together
contracted
their
faces
as
if
about
to
weep
and
the
invalid
with
a
vague
gesture
slightly
raised
her
bony
hands
the
fingers
of
which
moved
as
if
to
seize
something
in
the
air
while
her
bare
feet
as
yellow
as
her
hands
and
face
shiny
at
the
ankles
had
the
rigidity
of
death
and
all
that
was
exposed

up
from

every
now

by

the

bending
down
over

over

near

them
up
george
was
supporting
hippolyte
who
had
almost
fainted
without
trying
to
revive
her
he
had
but
a
confused
sensation
of
all
that
was
going
on
real
images
and
fantastic
images
whirled
around
his
brain
and
gave
him
hallucinations
a
continual
buzzing
filled
his
ears
and
prevented
him
from
hearing
any
other
sound
distinctly
his
heart
was
oppressed
with
a
keen
anguish
as
in
the
anguish
to
emerge
from
the
zone
of
this
horrible
dream
the
anguish
to
recover
his
first
lucidity
to
feel
the
loved
creature
palpitate
on
his
breast
and
to
see
once
more
the
tender
smile
maria
once
more
the
undulation
of
the
hymn
reached
him
once
more
the
house
of
the
virgin
appeared
to
him
on
the
left
amid
the
immense
human
swarm
reddish
in
the
solar
conflagration
throned
on
the
summits
of
the
profane
tents
irradiating
a
formidable
power
maria
maria
the
undulation
faded
away
and
at
a
bend
of
the
hill
the
sanctuary
disappeared
and
suddenly
a
cool
breath
glided
over
the
vast
waving
harvests
and
a
long
blue
band
cut
the
horizon
the
sea
there

george
as

just
attained

his

dilated

i
the
table
laid
in
the
loggia
presented
a
gay
appearance
with
its
transparent
porcelain
its
bluish
glassware
its
crimson
pinks
under
the
golden
light
of
a
fixed
large
lamp
which
attracted
the
nocturnal
moths
scattered
in
the
twilight

hippolyte
pointed
to
a
moth
larger
than
the
others
strange
in
appearance
covered
with
a
thick
red
flush
with
projecting
eyes
which
under
the
light
glittered
like
two
carbuncles

coming
on

coming

she
laughed
heartily
making
fun
of
the
instinctive
alarm
that
george
exhibited
in
spite
of
himself
when
one
of
these
insects
threatened
to
alight
on
him
i
must
have
it
she
cried
with
the
rapture
of
a
childish
caprice
and
she
tried
to
capture
the
diabolical
moth
which
without
settling
flew
around
the
lamp
her
attempts
abrupt
and
violent
were
unsuccessful
she
upset
a
glass
knocked
over
a
pyramid
of
fruit
almost
smashed
the
what
fury
said
george
who
wanted
to
excite
her
but
you
won
t
succeed
i
shall
succeed
replied
hippolyte
obstinately
and
looking
fixedly
at
him
will
you
make
a
bet
what
shall
we
bet
anything
you
like
well
then
a
love
game
very
well
a
love
game
in
the
warm
light
her
face
was
colored
with
its
softest
and
richest
tints
that
ideal
coloring
a
compound
of
pale
amber
and
dull
gold
in
which
were
mingled
perhaps
a
few
tints
of
faded
roses
in
which
formerly
george
had
thought
he
had
found
all
the
mystery
and
all
the
beauty
of
the
antique
venetian
soul
emigrated
to
the
kingdom
of
cyprus
she
wore
in
her
hair
a
pink
ardent
as
desire
and
her
eyes
shaded
by
the
lashes
shone
like
lakes
between
the
willows
in
the
twilight
at
that
instant
she
appeared
the
woman
of
delights
the
strong
and
delicate
instrument
of
pleasure
the
voluptuous
and
magnificent
animal
destined
to
ornament
a
banquet
to
enliven
a
bed
to
provoke
equivocal
phantasies
of
an
æsthetic
sensuality
she
appeared
in
the
supreme
splendor
of
her
active
supple
lascivious
cruel
george
observed
her
with
attentive
curiosity
and
he
thought
what
different
appearances
she
assumes
in
my
eyes
her
form
is
sketched
by
my
desire
her
shadows
are
produced
by
my
thought
such
as
she
appears
to
me
each
instant
she
is
only
the
effect
of
my
continual
inner
creation
she
exists
only
in
me
her
appearances
change
like
the
dreams
of
an
invalid
dum
when
was
that
he
retained
but
a
very
confused
recollection
of
the
time
when
he
had
kissed
her
brow
and
decorated
her
with
this
title
of
ideal
nobility
now
this
glorification
of
the
loved
one
had
become
almost
inconceivable
to
him
he
remembered
vaguely
certain
words
that
she
had
uttered
and
that
seemed
to
reveal
a
depth
of
soul
what
spoke
in
her
then
was
it
not
my
own
soul
it
was
one
of
my
ambitions
to
offer
to
my
sad
soul
those
sinuous
lips
so
she
might
exhale
her
sorrow
from
an
instrument
of
signal
beauty
he
looked
at
those
lips
they
were
slightly
contracted
not
ungracefully
participating
in
the
intense
attention
with
which
hippolyte
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
seize
the
she
watched
for
it
with
sly
prudence
she
wanted
with
one
killing
blow
to
shut
up
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
the
winged
prey
that
was
whirling
restlessly
around
the
light
she
contracted
her
eyebrows
and
seemed
to
be
prepared
for
a
spring
ready
to
jump
she
leaped
forward
two
or
three
times
but
without
success
the
moth
was
unseizable
confess
that
you
ve
lost
said
george
i
won
t
abuse
my
privilege
no
confess
that
you
ve
lost
no
woe
to
him
and
to
you
if
i
catch
him
and
she
resumed
her
hunt
with
trembling
impatience
oh
he
s
gone
cried
george
who
had
lost
the
agile
from
sight
he
s
flown
away
hippolyte
was
really
vexed
the
wager
had
excited
her
she
rose
and
cast
a
keen
glance
around
the
room
to
discover
the
fugitive
here
it
is
she
cried
triumphant
there
on
the
wall
do
you
see
and
she
made
a
sign
that
she
regretted
she
had
cried
out
don
t
stir
she
went
on
in
a
low
tone
turning
towards
her
friend
the
moth
had
alighted
on
the
luminous
wall
and
stayed
there
motionless
similar
to
a
little
brown
spot
with
infinite
precaution
hippolyte
approached
and
her
beautiful
body
slender
and
flexible
cast
a
shadow
on
the
white
wall
quickly
her
hand
was
raised
descended
closed
i
have
it
i
have
it
and
she
exulted
with
childish
joy
what
forfeit
shall
i
impose
i
ll
put
it
down
your
neck
you
are
in
my
power
too
and
she
pretended
she
was
about
to
execute
her
threat
as
on
the
day
she
ran
after
him
on
the
hill
george
laughed
conquered
by
the
spontaneity
of
that
joy
which
awoke
in
him
all
that
still
remained
to
him
of
his
youth
he
said
come
now
sit
down
and
eat
your
fruit
quietly
wait
wait
what
are
you
going
to
do
wait
she
drew
out
the
pin
which
held
the
pink
in
her
hair
and
put
it
between
her
lips
then
gently
she
opened
her
fist
took
the
moth
by
the
wings
got
ready
to
transfix
it
how
cruel
you
are
said
george
how
cruel
you
are
she
smiled
attentive
to
her
work
while
the
little
victim
beat
its
wings
already
despoiled
how
cruel
you
are
repeated
george
in
a
lower
but
graver
voice
noticing
on
hippolyte
s
physiognomy
an
ambiguous
expression
mingled
with
complacency
and
repugnance
which
seemed
to
signify
that
she
found
a
special
pleasure
in
artificially
exciting
and
tormenting
her
own
feelings
he
recalled
that
in
several
circumstances
she
had
already
shown
a
morbid
taste
for
this
kind
of
excitation
no
pure
sentiment
of
pity
had
entered
her
heart
either
in
presence
of
the
tears
and
blood
of
the
pilgrims
at
the
sanctuary
or
in
the
presence
of
the
child
in
its
death
agony
and
he
saw
her
again
quickening
her
step
towards
the
group
of
curious
leaning
against
the
parapet
of
the
pincio
to
distinguish
the
traces
left
on
the
pavement
by
the
suicide
cruelty
is
latent
at
the
bottom
of
her
love
he
thought
there
is
something
destructive
in
her
and
this
shows
itself
all
the
stronger
as
the
ardor
of
her
caresses
becomes
more
intense
and
he
saw
once
more
the
frightful
and
almost
gorgonian
image
of
this
woman
just
as
she
had
often
appeared
to
his
eyes
in
the
spasm
of
voluptuousness
or
in
the
inertia
of
the
supreme
exhaustion
look
she
said
showing
him
the
moth
squirming
on
the
pin
look
how
its
eyes
shine
she
presented
it
in
different
ways
to
the
light
as
when
one
wishes
to
cause
the
scintillation
of
a
gem
she
added
what
a
beautiful
jewel
and
with
an
easy
gesture
she
stuck
it
in
her
hair
then
fixing
george
with
her
gray
eyes
you
do
nothing
but
think
think
think
what
are
you
thinking
of
at
least
you
used
to
perhaps
than
was
necessary
now
you
have
grown
taciturn
you
have
an
air
of
mystery
and
conspiracy
are
you
angry
with
me
speak
even
if
it
will
grieve
me
the
tone
of
her
voice
which
had
suddenly
changed
expressed
impatience
and
reproach
once
more
she
perceived
that
her
lover
had
been
only
a
meditative
and
solitary
spectator
a
vigilant
and
maybe
hostile
witness
do
speak
i
prefer
the
cruel
words
of
the
old
days
to
this
mysterious
silence
what
s
the
matter
doesn
t
it
please
you
to
be
here
are
you
unhappy
are
you
tired
of
me
are
you
disappointed
in
me
to
be
thus
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
taken
to
task
exasperated
george
but
he
repressed
his
even
tried
to
smile
why
these
strange
questions
he
said
calmly
does
it
worry
you
i
am
always
thinking
of
you
and
the
things
that
concern
you
and
quickly
with
an
amiable
smile
fearing
that
she
might
suspect
a
shade
of
irony
in
his
words
he
added
you
fecundate
my
brain
when
i
am
in
your
presence
my
inner
life
is
so
full
that
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
displeases
me
she
was
pleased
with
this
affected
phrase
which
seemed
to
elevate
her
to
a
spiritual
function
to
proclaim
her
the
creator
of
a
superior
life
the
expression
of
her
face
became
serious
while
in
her
hair
the
nocturnal
moth
squirmed
continuously
permit
me
to
remain
silent
without
being
suspected
he
continued
appreciating
the
change
produced
by
his
artifice
in
this
feminine
soul
which
the
idealities
of
love
fascinated
and
exalted
permit
me
to
remain
silent
do
you
ask
me
to
speak
when
you
see
me
dying
under
your
kisses
well
it
is
not
your
mouth
alone
which
has
the
power
to
give
me
sensations
surpassing
all
known
limits
every
moment
you
give
me
an
excess
of
sentiment
and
an
excess
of
thought
you
will
never
imagine
what
agitations
are
aroused
in
my
mind
by
a
single
one
of
your
gestures
when
you
stir
when
you
speak
i
see
a
series
of
prodigies
at
times
you
give
me
as
it
were
a
reminiscence
of
a
life
i
have
never
lived
immensities
of
darkness
are
suddenly
illumined
and
live
in
my
memory
like
conquests
what
then
are
the
bread
the
viands
the
those
material
things
that
make
an
impression
on
my
senses
what
are
the
very
operations
of
my
organs
the
external
manifestations
of
my
corporeal
existence
when
my
mouth
speaks
it
seems
almost
as
if
the
sound
of
my
voice
can
not
reach
the
depths
in
which
i
live
it
seems
to
me
that
not
to
disturb
my
vision
i
should
rest
motionless
and
mute
while
you
pass
perpetually
transformed
across
the
worlds
which
you
have
revealed
he
spoke
slowly
his
eyes
fixed
on
hippolyte
fascinated
by
this
extraordinarily
luminous
face
crowned
by
hair
dark
and
deep
as
the
night
and
in
which
a
living
and
dying
thing
caused
a
continual
palpitation
this
face
so
near
and
yet
which
seemed
to
him
intangible
and
these
scattered
objects
on
the
table
and
these
high
purple
flowers
and
this
whirl
of
forms
around
the
source
of
the
light
and
the
pure
serenity
which
descended
from
the
stars
and
the
musical
breath
which
rose
from
the
sea
and
all
the
images
reflected
by
his
seemed
to
him
as
in
a
dream
his
very
person
his
very
voice
seemed
fictitious
to
him
her
thoughts
and
words
were
associated
in
an
easy
and
vague
manner
as
on
the
moonlit
night
in
front
of
the
marvellous
vine
the
substance
of
his
life
and
of
the
universal
life
was
dissolved
in
the
mists
of
the
dream
ii
under
the
tent
erected
on
the
sand
after
the
bath
still
he
watched
hippolyte
lingering
in
the
sun
by
the
wrapped
in
her
white
peignoir
he
had
almost
painful
scintillations
in
his
eyes
and
the
strong
noonday
sun
caused
him
a
novel
sensation
of
physical
trouble
mingled
with
a
sort
of
vague
fear
it
was
the
terrible
hour
the
supreme
hour
of
light
and
silence
hovering
over
the
chasm
of
life
he
comprehended
the
pagan
superstition
the
holy
horror
of
canicular
on
the
shore
inhabited
by
a
cruel
and
occult
god
at
the
bottom
of
his
vague
fright
stirred
something
like
the
anxiety
of
the
man
who
expects
a
sudden
and
formidable
apparition
he
appeared
to
himself
puerilely
weak
and
cowardly
as
diminished
in
courage
and
strength
as
after
a
trial
that
has
not
succeeded
in
plunging
his
body
into
the
sea
in
presenting
his
brow
to
the
glare
of
the
sun
in
swimming
a
short
distance
in
indulging
his
favorite
exercise
in
measuring
his
respiration
by
the
breath
of
the
endless
space
he
had
felt
by
indubitable
indications
the
impoverishment
of
his
youth
the
destructive
work
of
the
enemy
he
had
felt
once
more
the
iron
band
tighten
around
his
vital
activity
and
so
reduce
a
new
zone
to
inertia
and
impotency
the
sensation
of
this
muscular
lassitude
became
all
the
deeper
in
proportion
as
he
regarded
more
attentively
the
figure
of
that
woman
standing
in
the
splendor
of
the
day
to
dry
her
hair
she
had
unfastened
it
and
the
curls
made
heavy
by
the
water
fell
over
her
shoulders
so
dark
that
they
almost
appeared
violet
her
erect
and
slender
form
enveloped
as
in
the
folds
of
a
dress
stood
out
half
against
the
glaucous
surface
of
the
sea
and
half
against
the
luminous
transparency
of
the
sky
scarcely
could
one
see
underneath
the
hair
the
profile
of
her
bent
and
pensive
face
she
was
wholly
absorbed
in
the
alternate
pleasures
of
putting
her
bare
feet
in
the
torrid
sand
and
keeping
them
there
as
long
as
she
could
endure
the
heat
then
in
plunging
them
all
burning
into
the
caressing
waves
that
licked
the
sand
this
double
sensation
seemed
to
afford
her
infinite
enjoyment
in
which
she
lost
herself
she
tempered
and
fortified
her
soul
by
the
contact
with
free
and
healthy
things
by
the
complacent
absorption
of
the
salt
water
and
the
sunbeams
how
at
the
same
time
could
she
be
so
ill
and
so
well
how
could
she
conciliate
in
her
being
so
many
contradictions
assume
so
many
aspects
in
a
single
day
in
a
single
hour
the
taciturn
and
sad
woman
in
whom
epilepsy
was
breeding
the
mistress
eager
and
convulsed
whose
ardor
was
at
times
alarming
whose
sensuality
had
at
times
the
lugubrious
appearance
of
same
creature
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
had
senses
capable
of
gathering
and
savoring
all
the
natural
delights
shed
over
the
surrounding
things
of
appearing
similar
to
the
images
of
the
ancient
beauty
leaning
over
the
harmonious
crystal
of
a
hellespont
she
had
an
evidently
superior
power
of
resistance
george
viewed
her
with
a
vexation
which
becoming
gradually
concentrated
ended
by
assuming
the
seriousness
of
rancor
the
sentiment
of
his
own
weakness
was
disturbed
by
hatred
in
proportion
as
his
perspicacity
became
more
lucid
and
almost
vindictive
those
bare
feet
which
by
turns
she
burnt
in
the
sand
and
cooled
in
the
water
were
not
beautiful
the
toes
were
even
deformed
plebeian
not
at
all
bore
the
impress
of
a
lowly
origin
george
looked
at
them
attentively
saw
only
them
with
an
extraordinary
clearness
of
perception
as
if
the
details
of
their
shape
had
revealed
a
secret
to
him
and
he
thought
how
many
impure
things
are
fermenting
in
that
blood
all
the
hereditary
instincts
of
her
race
persist
in
her
indestructible
ready
to
develop
and
arise
against
any
restraint
whatsoever
i
shall
never
succeed
in
making
her
pure
i
shall
be
able
only
to
superpose
her
real
individuality
above
the
changing
images
of
my
dreams
and
she
will
be
able
only
to
offer
to
my
solitary
intoxication
the
indispensable
instrument
of
her
organs
but
while
his
intelligence
reduced
this
woman
to
be
but
a
simple
for
his
imagination
and
despoiled
of
all
value
the
palpable
form
the
very
acuteness
of
the
present
perception
made
him
feel
that
what
attached
him
to
her
the
most
was
precisely
the
real
quality
of
that
flesh
not
only
what
there
was
most
beautiful
in
her
but
above
all
was
least
beautiful
in
the
discovery
of
defect
did
not
loosen
the
tie
did
not
diminish
the
fascination
the
most
vulgar
features
had
an
irritating
attraction
for
him
he
knew
well
this
phenomenon
which
had
often
asserted
itself
often
with
perfect
clearness
of
vision
his
eyes
had
seen
the
slightest
defects
of
hippolyte
s
person
accentuated
and
they
had
been
for
a
long
time
subject
to
the
attraction
they
had
been
compelled
to
establish
them
to
examine
them
to
exaggerate
them
and
by
his
senses
in
his
mind
he
had
felt
an
indefinable
disquietude
almost
always
followed
by
the
sudden
ardor
of
desire
that
certainly
was
the
most
terrible
indication
of
the
great
carnal
obsession
which
a
human
creature
exercises
over
another
human
creature
such
was
the
spell
which
was
obeyed
by
the
nameless
lover
who
in
his
mistress
loved
above
all
the
marks
traced
by
the
years
on
her
white
neck
the
parting
of
the
hair
every
day
wider
the
faded
mouth
on
which
the
salty
tears
made
the
savor
of
the
kisses
more
lasting
he
thought
of
the
flight
of
years
of
the
chain
riveted
forever
by
custom
of
the
infinite
sadness
of
the
love
become
a
weary
vice
he
saw
himself
in
the
future
tied
to
this
flesh
like
the
slave
to
his
iron
collar
deprived
of
will
and
thought
stupefied
and
vacuous
he
saw
the
concubine
fade
grow
old
abandon
herself
without
resistance
to
the
slow
work
of
time
let
fall
from
her
inert
hands
the
lacerated
veil
of
illusions
but
preserve
nevertheless
her
fatal
power
he
saw
the
deserted
house
desolate
silent
awaiting
the
supreme
visitor
death
he
recalled
the
shouts
of
the
little
bastards
heard
on
that
distant
afternoon
in
the
paternal
house
he
thought
she
is
barren
her
entrails
have
been
visited
by
a
curse
in
it
the
germs
perish
as
in
a
fiery
furnace
she
thus
thwarts
and
betrays
the
most
profound
instinct
of
life
the
uselessness
of
his
love
appeared
to
him
like
a
monstrous
transgression
of
the
supreme
law
but
since
his
love
was
an
uneasy
sensuality
only
why
had
he
then
this
character
of
ineluctable
fatality
was
not
the
instinct
of
the
perpetuation
of
the
race
the
unique
and
true
motive
of
all
sexual
love
was
not
this
blind
and
eternal
instinct
the
source
of
desire
and
should
not
desire
have
as
its
object
occult
or
manifest
the
generation
prescribed
by
nature
how
was
it
then
that
so
strong
a
tie
attached
him
to
the
barren
woman
why
was
the
terrible
will
of
the
species
so
obstinate
in
demanding
in
exacting
the
vital
tribute
of
that
organism
ravaged
by
disease
and
incapable
of
generating
what
was
lacking
in
his
love
was
the
first
reason
of
affirmation
and
the
development
of
life
beyond
the
limits
of
individual
existence
what
was
lacking
in
the
woman
he
loved
was
the
highest
mystery
of
her
suffering
of
her
who
gives
birth
and
what
caused
the
misery
of
both
was
precisely
that
persistent
monstrosity
aren
t
you
coming
in
the
sun
asked
hippolyte
suddenly
turning
towards
him
look
how
i
am
standing
it
i
want
to
become
really
what
you
an
shall
i
she
approached
the
tent
raising
with
her
two
hands
the
edge
of
her
long
tunic
putting
in
her
gestures
an
almost
lascivious
grace
as
though
suddenly
invaded
by
languor
shall
i
she
stooped
a
little
to
enter
the
tent
under
the
abundance
of
snowy
folds
her
thin
and
flexible
body
had
movements
of
feline
grace
exhaled
a
heat
and
odor
which
spurred
strangely
the
disturbed
sensibility
of
the
young
man
and
while
she
stretched
herself
out
on
the
mat
beside
him
there
fell
all
around
his
flaming
face
a
shower
of
hair
still
wet
with
salt
water
and
through
which
shone
the
white
of
her
eyes
and
the
red
of
her
lips
like
fruits
among
foliage
in
her
voice
as
on
her
face
as
in
her
smile
there
was
a
shadow
an
infinitely
mysterious
and
fascinating
shadow
it
seemed
as
if
she
divined
her
lover
s
secret
hostility
and
was
getting
ready
to
triumph
over
it
what
are
you
looking
at
she
asked
with
a
sudden
start
no
no
don
t
look
at
them
they
are
ugly
she
withdrew
her
feet
hid
them
under
the
folds
of
her
peignoir
no
no
i
forbid
you
she
was
vexed
and
ashamed
for
a
moment
she
frowned
as
if
she
had
surprised
in
george
s
eyes
a
spark
of
the
cruel
truth
unkind
man
she
said
again
in
an
ambiguous
tone
of
pleasantry
and
rancor
he
replied
rather
enervated
you
know
that
in
my
eyes
you
are
beautiful
all
over
and
he
made
the
gesture
as
if
to
draw
her
to
him
and
kiss
her
no
wait
don
t
look
she
arose
and
glided
to
a
corner
of
the
tent
rapidly
with
furtive
gestures
she
drew
on
her
long
stockings
then
she
turned
round
immodestly
an
indefinable
smile
hovering
on
her
lips
and
before
george
s
eyes
holding
up
one
after
the
other
her
perfect
legs
in
their
shining
sheath
she
fastened
her
garters
above
each
knee
in
her
action
there
was
something
wilfully
lascivious
and
in
her
smile
there
was
a
touch
of
subtle
irony
and
that
mute
and
terrible
eloquence
assumed
in
the
young
man
s
eyes
this
precise
signification
i
am
always
the
unconquered
you
have
known
with
me
all
the
enjoyments
for
which
your
endless
desire
was
thirsty
and
i
will
clothe
myself
in
lies
that
will
endlessly
provoke
your
desire
what
matters
to
me
your
perspicacity
the
veil
that
you
tear
i
can
repair
in
an
instant
the
bandage
that
you
pluck
off
i
can
fasten
in
an
instant
i
am
stronger
than
your
thought
i
know
the
secret
of
my
transfigurations
in
your
soul
i
know
the
gestures
and
the
words
that
have
the
virtue
of
metamorphosing
me
in
your
eyes
the
odor
of
my
skin
has
the
power
to
dissolve
a
world
in
you
in
him
a
world
was
being
dissolved
while
she
drew
near
serpentine
and
insidious
to
fling
herself
at
his
side
on
the
coarse
rush
mat
once
more
the
reality
was
converted
into
a
confused
fiction
full
of
hallucinating
images
the
reverberation
of
the
sea
filled
the
tent
with
a
reflection
of
gold
mingled
a
thousand
golden
spangles
in
the
threads
of
the
tissue
through
the
opening
was
a
glimpse
of
the
immensity
of
the
calm
sea
the
vast
immobility
of
the
waters
under
an
almost
lugubrious
blaze
and
gradually
these
very
appearances
faded
away
in
the
silence
he
heard
nothing
more
but
the
rhythm
of
his
own
blood
in
the
shade
he
saw
nothing
but
two
large
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
a
kind
of
fury
she
enshrouded
him
completely
as
if
she
possessed
the
nature
of
a
cloud
and
through
all
the
pores
of
this
ardent
skin
he
inhaled
the
marine
fragrance
like
a
salt
volatilized
through
a
flame
and
in
the
thickness
of
her
still
humid
hair
he
beheld
the
mystery
of
the
deepest
forests
of
and
in
the
final
bewilderment
of
his
conscience
he
imagined
he
touched
the
bottom
of
an
abyss
falling
to
his
death
then
he
heard
as
if
at
a
distance
amid
the
rustling
of
skirts
hippolyte
s
voice
which
was
saying
do
you
want
to
stay
a
little
longer
are
you
asleep
he
opened
his
eyes
he
murmured
all
dazed
no
i
m
not
asleep
what
s
the
matter
i
m
expiring
he
tried
to
smile
he
caught
a
glance
of
hippolyte
s
white
teeth
she
said
smiling
do
you
want
me
to
help
you
to
dress
no
i
ll
get
dressed
presently
go
on
i
ll
join
you
he
murmured
with
a
sleepy
tone
then
i
ll
go
back
i
m
too
hungry
dress
quickly
and
come
yes
immediately
he
started
when
he
felt
unexpectedly
hippolyte
s
lips
on
his
lips
he
opened
his
eyes
he
tried
to
smile
have
pity
he
heard
the
crunching
of
the
sand
under
her
receding
footsteps
a
heavy
silence
again
took
possession
of
the
beach
at
intervals
a
light
splashing
came
from
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
the
neighboring
rocks
a
feeble
noise
like
that
made
by
animals
drinking
in
a
trough
a
few
minutes
passed
during
which
he
struggled
against
an
exhaustion
that
threatened
to
turn
into
lethargy
finally
he
sat
up
not
without
effort
he
shook
his
head
to
dissipate
his
clouded
thoughts
he
looked
all
around
him
with
bewilderment
he
felt
in
his
whole
being
a
strange
sensation
of
emptiness
he
was
no
longer
able
to
coördinate
his
ideas
he
was
almost
incapable
of
thought
and
to
accomplish
any
act
he
needed
an
enormous
effort
he
threw
a
glance
outside
the
tent
and
was
again
invaded
by
the
horror
of
the
light
oh
if
on
lying
down
again
i
could
never
rise
again
to
die
never
to
see
her
again
he
felt
overwhelmed
by
the
certainty
that
in
a
few
instants
he
must
see
this
woman
again
he
must
stay
near
her
he
must
receive
more
of
her
kisses
he
must
hear
her
speak
before
beginning
to
dress
he
hesitated
several
mad
ideas
passed
through
his
brain
then
he
dressed
mechanically
he
went
out
of
the
tent
and
the
glare
of
the
light
made
him
close
his
eyes
through
the
tissue
of
his
eyelids
he
saw
a
great
red
light
he
had
a
slight
vertigo
when
he
reopened
his
eyes
the
spectacle
of
the
external
things
gave
him
an
inexpressible
sensation
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
saw
everything
again
after
an
indefinite
time
during
a
different
existence
the
sandy
beach
beaten
by
the
sun
had
the
whiteness
of
chalk
on
the
immense
and
lugubrious
mirror
of
the
sea
the
incandescent
sky
seemed
to
subside
every
second
more
under
the
weight
of
one
of
those
gloomy
silences
that
accompany
the
expectation
of
an
unknown
catastrophe
the
sandy
promontories
with
their
large
deserted
creeks
rose
in
the
form
of
towers
above
the
black
rocks
their
crests
wooded
with
that
stood
out
against
the
torrid
sky
in
the
attitudes
of
anger
or
madness
stretched
out
on
the
rocks
like
some
monster
ready
to
spring
on
its
prey
the
trabocco
with
its
numerous
machines
had
a
formidable
aspect
in
the
entanglement
of
the
beams
and
ropes
one
could
distinguish
the
fishermen
stooping
towards
the
waters
steady
motionless
like
bronzes
and
over
their
tragic
lives
hung
the
mortal
spell
all
at
once
amid
the
silence
a
voice
struck
the
young
man
s
ears
it
was
the
woman
calling
him
from
the
height
of
the
hermitage
he
started
he
turned
round
with
an
impressive
palpitation
the
voice
repeated
its
call
limpid
and
strong
as
if
it
wished
to
affirm
its
power
come
while
he
climbed
up
the
hill
the
smoky
mouth
of
one
of
the
tunnels
cast
in
the
air
a
rumbling
reverberation
which
resounded
throughout
the
gulf
he
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
railroad
taken
anew
with
a
slight
dizziness
and
the
flash
of
an
insane
idea
crossed
his
wearied
brain
to
lie
down
across
the
rails
the
end
of
all
in
a
second
deafening
rapid
and
sinister
the
train
which
passed
swept
in
his
face
the
wind
it
displaced
then
whistling
and
rumbling
it
disappeared
in
the
mouth
of
the
opposite
tunnel
the
black
smoke
curling
up
in
the
sky
iii
from
dawn
until
twilight
the
songs
of
the
and
on
the
slopes
of
the
fecund
hill
masculine
choruses
with
a
bacchic
vehemence
were
celebrating
their
joy
at
the
abundant
feast
and
the
richness
of
the
old
wine
for
the
men
of
the
scythe
the
time
of
the
harvest
was
a
time
of
abundancy
hour
after
hour
from
dawn
to
twilight
according
to
the
custom
they
interrupted
their
work
to
eat
and
drink
on
the
field
of
stubble
among
the
newly
made
sheaves
in
honor
of
the
generous
master
and
each
took
from
his
porringer
the
share
of
nourishment
sufficient
to
satiate
one
of
the
women
thus
at
the
hour
of
the
repast
boaz
had
said
to
ruth
the
moabite
come
thou
hither
and
eat
of
the
bread
and
dip
thou
thy
morsel
in
the
vinegar
and
ruth
came
and
sat
down
beside
the
reapers
and
was
sufficed
but
the
feminine
choruses
were
prolonged
in
almost
religious
cadences
with
a
slow
and
solemn
sweetness
revealing
the
original
holiness
of
the
alimentary
work
the
primitive
nobility
of
this
task
where
on
the
ancestral
soil
the
sweat
of
man
consecrated
the
nativity
of
the
bread
george
heard
them
and
followed
them
his
soul
attentive
and
gradually
a
beneficent
and
influence
penetrated
him
his
soul
seemed
to
gradually
dilate
by
an
aspiration
always
broader
and
more
serene
in
proportion
as
the
wave
of
the
chant
propagated
in
the
still
torrid
noons
became
purer
but
in
it
the
hope
of
the
pacifying
night
began
to
spread
a
species
of
ecstatic
calm
it
was
a
renewed
aspiration
towards
the
sources
of
life
towards
the
origins
it
was
perhaps
the
supreme
trembling
of
his
youth
attacked
in
the
deepest
part
of
its
substantial
energy
the
supreme
panting
towards
the
regaining
of
happiness
lost
henceforth
forever
the
was
drawing
to
its
close
passing
along
the
mown
fields
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
nice
customs
that
seemed
to
be
the
rites
of
a
georgic
liturgy
one
day
he
stopped
close
to
a
field
already
despoiled
where
the
haymakers
had
just
constructed
the
last
haystack
and
he
was
a
witness
to
the
ceremony
on
the
things
exhausted
by
the
heat
hovered
the
limpid
and
sweet
hour
that
was
about
to
gather
in
its
crystalline
sphere
the
impalpable
ashes
of
the
consumed
day
the
field
was
laid
out
in
a
parallelogram
on
a
tableland
girt
with
gigantic
through
the
branches
of
which
were
glimpses
of
the
blue
band
of
the
adriatic
mysterious
as
the
velum
perceived
in
the
temple
behind
the
silver
palms
the
high
haystacks
were
erected
at
intervals
in
the
form
of
cones
massive
and
opulent
with
the
richness
heaped
up
by
the
arms
of
men
celebrated
by
the
songs
of
women
when
the
toil
was
ended
the
band
of
haymakers
made
a
circle
around
its
chief
in
the
centre
of
the
field
they
were
robust
sunburnt
men
dressed
in
linen
on
their
arms
on
their
legs
on
their
bare
feet
they
had
deformities
which
the
long
and
slow
endurance
of
manual
labor
imprints
on
limbs
that
toil
in
the
fist
of
each
man
shone
a
scythe
curved
and
thin
as
the
moon
in
its
first
quarter
from
time
to
time
with
a
simple
gesture
of
their
disengaged
hand
they
wiped
the
sweat
from
their
brows
and
with
it
sprinkled
the
ground
where
the
straw
was
shining
under
the
oblique
rays
of
the
setting
sun
in
his
turn
the
chief
made
the
same
gesture
then
raising
his
hand
as
if
to
bless
he
cried
in
his
sonorous
voice
rich
in
rhythm
and
assonance
let
s
leave
the
field
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
in
chorus
the
men
of
the
scythe
replied
with
a
great
cry
amen
and
the
chief
went
on
blessed
be
our
master
and
blessed
be
our
mistress
the
men
replied
amen
and
the
chief
in
a
voice
that
gradually
gathered
strength
and
fire
blessed
be
he
who
brought
us
good
food
to
eat
amen
blessed
be
he
who
says
don
t
put
water
in
the
wine
of
the
haymaker
amen
blessed
be
the
employer
who
says
to
his
lady
give
without
measuring
and
put
sapor
in
the
wine
of
the
haymaker
amen
the
benedictions
extended
from
one
to
another
to
him
who
had
killed
the
sheep
to
him
who
had
washed
the
herbs
and
vegetables
to
him
who
had
polished
the
copper
saucepan
to
him
who
had
seasoned
the
meats
with
spices
and
the
chief
in
the
fire
of
enthusiasm
in
the
sudden
transport
of
a
sort
of
poetic
fury
expressed
himself
all
at
once
in
couplets
the
band
replied
to
him
by
immense
clamors
that
reverberated
through
all
the
creeks
while
on
the
iron
of
the
scythes
the
flashes
of
the
twilight
and
the
sheaves
arranged
on
the
top
of
the
stacks
had
the
appearance
of
flames
blessed
be
the
woman
who
sings
beautiful
songs
while
bringing
pitchers
of
old
wine
amen
there
was
a
thunderclap
of
joy
then
all
were
silent
and
watched
approach
the
chorus
of
the
women
bearers
of
the
last
gifts
of
the
mown
field
the
women
in
double
file
were
singing
carrying
in
their
arms
the
large
painted
jars
and
the
uninitiated
spectator
seeing
them
advance
between
the
as
through
a
colonnade
against
the
maritime
background
might
imagine
he
saw
one
of
those
votive
images
that
develop
harmoniously
in
on
the
friezes
of
the
temples
or
around
the
sarcophagi
as
he
went
back
to
the
house
this
image
of
beauty
accompanied
him
along
the
road
while
he
slowly
wended
his
way
amid
the
illusions
of
the
evening
in
which
were
still
floating
the
waves
of
the
choruses
at
a
bend
in
the
road
he
stopped
to
listen
to
a
melodious
voice
that
was
approaching
and
that
he
seemed
to
recognize
as
soon
as
he
recognized
it
he
started
joyfully
it
was
the
voice
of
favetta
the
young
singer
with
the
falconlike
eyes
with
the
vibrating
voice
that
always
awoke
in
him
the
memory
of
that
delicious
may
morning
resplendent
on
the
labyrinth
of
the
blossoming
furze
on
the
solitude
of
the
garden
of
gold
in
which
to
his
surprise
he
thought
he
had
discovered
the
secret
of
joy
without
suspecting
the
presence
of
the
stranger
hidden
by
a
hedge
favetta
advanced
leading
a
cow
by
the
tether
and
she
sang
her
head
high
her
mouth
open
towards
the
sky
the
full
light
on
her
face
and
from
her
throat
the
song
gushed
forth
fluid
limpid
crystal
as
a
stream
behind
her
the
fine
snowy
beast
ambled
gently
and
at
each
step
its
fetlock
undulated
and
its
massive
udder
swollen
with
milk
by
the
pasture
dangled
between
its
legs
when
she
perceived
the
stranger
the
singer
stopped
singing
and
seemed
about
to
halt
but
he
went
to
meet
her
with
a
joyous
air
as
if
he
had
met
a
friend
of
the
happy
days
where
are
you
going
favetta
he
cried
hearing
herself
addressed
by
her
name
she
blushed
and
smiled
with
embarrassment
i
m
taking
the
cow
to
the
shed
she
replied
as
she
had
suddenly
slowed
down
her
step
the
snout
of
the
beast
grazed
her
hips
and
her
bold
bust
stood
out
between
the
large
horns
as
in
the
crescent
of
a
lyre
you
re
always
singing
said
george
admiring
her
in
this
attitude
ah
signor
she
said
with
a
smile
if
we
couldn
t
sing
what
could
we
do
do
you
remember
that
morning
when
you
plucked
the
furze
flowers
the
first
flowers
for
your
lady
yes
do
you
remember
i
remember
sing
again
for
me
the
song
you
sang
that
day
i
can
t
sing

favetta
and
she
resumed
her
way
along
the
path
dragging
the
peaceable
beast
after
her
when
she
had
gone
a
little
way
she
struck
up
the
song
with
all
the
strength
of
her
voice
that
invaded
the
surrounding
luminous
country
the
sun
had
just
set
and
an
extraordinarily
vivid
light
was
shed
over
the
coasts
and
over
the
sea
an
immense
wave
of
impalpable
gold
mounted
from
the
occidental
sky
to
the
zenith
and
redescended
to
the
opposite
side
the
glassy
transparency
of
which
it
penetrated
with
infinite
slowness
gradually
the
adriatic
became
more
clear
and
more
gentle
approaching
the
green
hue
of
the
first
leaves
of
the
new
shoots
of
willows
alone
the
red
sails
as
superb
as
if
they
were
of
purple
broke
the
diffused
light
it
s
a
holiday
thought
george
dazzled
by
the
splendid
sunset
feeling
palpitate
around
him
the
joy
of
life
where
does
the
human
creature
breathe
for
whom
the
whole
day
from
dawn
to
twilight
should
not
be
a
holiday
consecrated
by
some
new
conquest
on
the
hill
the
songs
in
honor
of
the
nativity
of
the
bread
continued
and
alternated
the
long
feminine
files
appeared
on
the
slopes
and
disappeared
here
and
there
in
the
still
air
columns
of
smoke
rose
slowly
from
invisible
fires
the
spectacle
grew
solemn
and
seemed
to
sink
back
into
the
mystery
of
the
primitive
centuries
in
the
holiness
of
a
celebration
of
rural
dionysiacs
iv
since
the
tragic
night
on
which
candia
lowering
her
voice
had
spoken
of
the
witchcraft
that
hung
over
the
men
of
the
trabocco
that
great
whitish
framework
stretched
along
on
the
rocks
had
more
than
once
attracted
the
strangers
attention
and
excited
their
curiosity
in
the
crescent
of
the
little
musical
bay
that
bristling
and
treacherous
form
continually
lying
in
ambush
seemed
to
deny
the
benignity
of
the
solitude
at
the
burning
and
motionless
at
the
misty
twilights
it
often
took
on
formidable
aspects
at
times
when
all
was
still
one
could
hear
the
grinding
of
the
capstan
and
the
creaking
of
the
timber
during
the
moonless
nights
the
red
light
of
the
torches
was
seen
reflected
by
the
water
on
an
afternoon
of
oppressive
idleness
george
proposed
to
hippolyte
shall
we
go
and
visit
the
trabocco
she
answered
we
ll
go
if
you
like
but
how
can
i
cross
the
bridge
i
have
already
tried
it
once
i
will
lead
you
by
the
hand
the
plank
is
too
narrow
we
ll
try
they
went
there
they
descended
by
the
path
at
the
turn
they
found
a
sort
of
stairway
hewn
in
the
granite
hardly
practicable
and
the
irregular
steps
of
which
stretched
out
as
far
as
the
reefs
at
the
end
of
the
shaky
bridge
you
see
how
can
i
manage
said
hippolyte
regretfully
even
looking
at
it
makes
my
head
swim
the
first
portion
of
the
bridge
was
composed
of
a
single
plank
very
narrow
upheld
by
stanchions
fixed
on
the
rock
the
other
part
broader
was
formed
of
transverse
thin
deal
boards
of
an
almost
silvery
whiteness
brittle
badly
joined
so
thin
that
they
seemed
likely
to
break
under
the
slightest
pressure
of
the
foot
don
t
you
want
to
try
it
asked
george
with
an
inner
sense
of
strange
relief
on
finding
that
hippolyte
would
never
succeed
in
accomplishing
the
perilous
passage
look
someone
is
coming
to
lend
us
a
hand
a
child
ran
toward
them
from
the
platform
agile
as
a
cat
brown
as
a
rich
golden
bronze
beneath
his
unfaltering
foot
the
deal
boards
creaked
the
rafters
bent
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
near
the
strangers
he
encouraged
them
by
energetic
gestures
to
confide
in
him
looking
up
at
them
with
his
piercing
eyes
like
the
bird
at
its
prey
don
t
you
want
to
try
repeated
george
smiling
irresolute
she
advanced
one
foot
on
the
shaking
plank
looked
at
the
rocks
and
water
then
drew
back
incapable
of
conquering
her
agitation
i
fear
vertigo
she
said
i
am
sure
i
should
fall
she
added
with
manifest
regret
go
go
alone
you
re
not
afraid
no
but
what
will
you
do
i
will
sit
down
in
the
shade
and
wait
for
you
she
added
again
with
hesitation
as
if
to
try
and
retain
him
but
why
do
you
go
there
i
m
going
i
m
curious
to
see
she
seemed
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
follow
him
vexed
at
letting
him
go
to
a
place
which
she
could
not
reach
herself
and
what
seemed
to
chagrin
and
vex
her
was
not
only
having
to
renounce
a
curiosity
and
pleasure
but
also
some
other
cause
not
distinct
what
made
her
suffer
also
was
the
temporary
obstacle
that
was
about
to
be
interposed
between
her
lover
and
herself
that
obstacle
over
which
she
was
powerless
to
climb
so
essential
had
become
the
necessity
of
holding
her
lover
always
attached
to
her
by
a
sensible
bond
to
be
with
him
in
uninterrupted
contact
to
dominate
him
to
possess
him
she
said
a
scarcely
perceptible
note
of
anger
in
her
voice
go
go
along
george
became
cognizant
of
a
sentiment
in
himself
that
contrasted
with
the
instinctive
sentiment
of
hippolyte
it
was
a
sort
of
relief
to
establish
beyond
doubt
that
there
was
a
place
where
hippolyte
could
not
follow
him
a
refuge
completely
inaccessible
to
the
enemy
a
retreat
defended
by
the
rocks
and
by
the
sea
where
he
could
at
last
find
a
few
hours
of
real
repose
and
these
two
impressions
of
their
souls
although
indistinct
and
even
somewhat
puerile
but
certainly
opposed
demonstrated
the
actual
position
of
the
lovers
toward
one
another
the
one
a
conscious
victim
destined
to
perish
the
other
an
unconscious
and
caressing
executioner
i
ll
go
said
george
with
a
shade
of
provocation
in
his
voice
and
attitude
although
he
did
not
feel
sure
of
himself
he
refused
the
child
s
assistance
and
was
very
careful
to
take
bold
and
sure
steps
not
to
hesitate
not
to
vacillate
on
the
shaking
plank
as
soon
as
he
had
put
foot
on
the
wider
part
he
hastened
his
steps
still
preoccupied
by
hippolyte
s
look
instinctively
giving
to
his
efforts
the
heat
of
a
hostile
reaction
when
he
trod
the
planks
of
the
platform
he
felt
the
illusory
sensation
of
finding
himself
on
the
bridge
of
a
ship
in
one
second
the
freshness
of
the
short
splashing
sea
that
broke
on
the
rocks
revived
in
his
memory
certain
fragments
of
the
life
that
he
had
lived
on
the
don
juan
and
he
felt
through
all
his
being
a
sudden
thrill
at
the
chimerical
idea
of
raising
the
anchor
immediately
after
his
gaze
was
attracted
to
the
surrounding
objects
the
slightest
details
of
which
he
remarked
with
his
usual
lucidity
turchino
had
saluted
him
abruptly
with
a
gesture
that
neither
word
nor
smile
softened
as
if
no
event
whatever
however
unusual
and
extraordinary
it
might
be
would
have
the
power
to
interrupt
even
for
a
second
the
terrible
preoccupation
that
appeared
on
his
terrene
face
almost
chinless
scarcely
larger
than
a
fist
with
a
long
prominent
nose
pointed
like
the
snout
of
a
pike
between
two
small
glittering
eyes
the
same
preoccupation
was
legible
in
the
faces
of
his
two
sons
who
also
saluted
in
silence
and
resumed
their
work
without
laying
aside
their
immutable
sadness
they
were
boys
of
over
twenty
fleshless
sunburnt
agitated
by
a
continual
muscular
restlessness
like
demoniacs
all
their
movements
had
an
air
of
convulsive
contraction
of
starts
and
beneath
the
skin
of
their
chinless
faces
the
muscles
could
be
seen
at
moments
trembling
is
the
fishing
good
asked
george
pointing
to
the
large
immerged
net
whose
corners
could
be
seen
at
the
surface
of
the
water
nothing
signor
murmured
turchino
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
anger
after
a
pause
he
added
who
knows
perhaps
you
ve
brought
us
good
luck
draw
up
the
net
let
s
see
his
sons
began
to
manoeuvre
the
capstan
through
the
interstices
of
the
planks
could
be
seen
the
reflecting
and
foaming
waves
in
a
corner
of
the
platform
stood
a
low
cabin
with
a
straw
roof
the
summit
of
which
had
a
layer
of
red
tiles
and
decorated
with
a
piece
of
sculptured
oak
in
the
form
of
a
bull
s
head
with
two
large
connecting
charm
against
witchcraft
other
amulets
were
suspended
from
the
roof
mingled
with
wooden
disks
on
which
were
glued
with
pitch
pieces
of
mirror
round
as
eyes
and
a
bunch
of
rusty
forks
lay
before
the
low
door
to
right
and
left
two
large
vertical
masts
were
erected
fixed
on
the
rock
fastened
at
their
bases
by
stakes
of
all
dimensions
that
intercrossed
and
mingled
riveted
to
one
another
by
enormous
nails
bound
by
iron
wire
and
cordage
strengthened
in
a
thousand
ways
against
the
rage
of
the
sea
two
other
horizontal
masts
crossed
the
first
two
and
stretched
out
like
bowsprits
beyond
the
rocks
over
the
deep
water
teeming
with
fish
at
the
forked
extremities
of
the
four
masts
hung
pulleys
provided
with
cords
corresponding
to
the
corners
of
the
square
net
other
cords
passed
through
other
pulleys
at
the
end
of
smaller
spars
as
far
a
the
most
distant
rocks
the
stakes
driven
in
sustained
the
cables
innumerable
planks
nailed
on
the
beams
strengthened
the
weakest
points
the
long
and
obstinate
struggle
against
the
fury
and
treacherousness
of
the
waves
was
as
if
written
on
this
enormous
carcass
by
means
of
these
knots
these
nails
this
machinery
the
machine
seemed
to
have
a
life
of
its
own
to
have
the
air
and
figure
of
an
animated
body
the
wood
exposed
for
years
to
sun
rain
and
tempest
showed
all
its
fibres
exhibited
all
its
rugosities
and
knottiness
revealed
every
part
of
its
resistant
structure
was
denuded
was
consumed
was
white
like
a
tibia
or
shining
like
silver
or
grayish
like
silex
acquired
a
special
character
and
significance
an
imprint
just
as
distinct
as
that
of
a
person
on
whom
old
age
and
suffering
have
achieved
their
cruel
work
the
capstan
creaked
as
it
turned
by
the
impulsion
of
the
four
bars
and
the
whole
machine
trembled
and
creaked
under
the
effort
while
the
vast
net
gradually
emerged
with
golden
reflections
from
the
green
depth
nothing
grumbled
the
father
on
seeing
the
empty
bottom
of
the
net
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
water
the
sons
released
the
bars
together
and
with
still
louder
creakings
the
capstan
began
to
turn
beating
the
air
with
its
four
brutish
arms
that
could
have
cut
a
man
in
twain
the
net
replunged
into
the
water
all
were
silent
in
the
silence
was
heard
only
the
breaking
of
the
sea
against
the
rocks
the
weight
of
witchcraft
crushed
these
miserable
lives
george
had
lost
all
curiosity
to
question
them
to
discover
to
know
but
he
felt
that
this
taciturn
and
tragic
company
would
soon
possess
for
him
the
attraction
of
dolorous
affinity
was
he
not
too
the
victim
of
a
malefice
and
he
looked
instinctively
toward
the
beach
where
appeared
the
figure
of
the
woman
outlined
against
a
rock
he
returned
to
the
trabocco
almost
every
day
at
different
hours
it
became
the
favorite
place
for
his
dreams
and
his
meditations
the
fishermen
had
become
accustomed
to
his
visits
they
received
him
respectfully
prepared
in
the
shade
of
the
hut
a
couch
for
him
made
from
an
old
sail
smelling
of
tar
on
his
part
he
was
not
illiberal
toward
them
in
listening
to
the
murmur
of
the
waters
in
watching
the
top
of
the
mast
immovable
in
the
azure
he
evoked
his
nautical
recollections
relived
his
wandering
life
of
summers
that
life
of
limitless
liberty
that
seemed
to
him
singularly
beautiful
and
almost
chimerical
he
recalled
his
last
voyage
on
the
adriatic
several
months
after
the
epiphany
of
love
during
a
period
of
sorrows
and
poetic
enthusiasms
under
the
influence
of
percy
shelley
of
that
divine
ariel
whom
the
sea
had
transfigured
into
something
rich
and
strange
and
he
recalled
the
debarkation
at
rimini
the
entry
into
malamocco
the
anchorage
before
the
schiavoni
quays
all
gilded
by
the
september
sun
where
now
was
his
old
travelling
companion
adolpho
astorgi
where
was
the
the
preceding
week
he
had
received
news
of
it
from
chios
in
a
letter
that
seemed
still
impregnated
with
the
odor
of
mastic
and
which
announced
the
coming
shipment
of
a
quantity
of
oriental
confections
adolpho
astorgi
was
truly
a
fraternal
spirit
the
only
one
with
whom
he
had
been
able
to
live
a
little
time
in
complete
communion
without
feeling
the
embarrassment
uneasiness
and
repugnance
that
prolonged
familiarity
with
his
other
friends
almost
always
caused
him
how
unfortunate
he
should
be
so
far
away
now
and
at
times
he
represented
him
to
himself
as
an
unexpected
deliverer
who
would
appear
with
his
vessel
in
the
waters
of
san
vito
to
propose
escape
to
him
in
his
incurable
weakness
in
this
total
abolition
of
active
will
he
lingered
at
times
in
dreams
of
this
kind
he
implored
the
arrival
of
a
strong
and
imperious
man
who
would
roughly
rouse
him
and
who
breaking
his
chains
with
an
abrupt
and
definite
blow
forever
would
enliven
him
carry
him
off
confine
him
in
some
lost
region
where
he
would
be
unknown
to
everybody
where
he
would
know
no
one
and
where
he
could
either
begin
life
over
again
or
die
a
less
hopeless
death
die
he
must
he
knew
to
what
he
was
condemned
knew
it
to
be
irrevocable
and
he
was
convinced
that
the
final
act
would
be
accomplished
during
the
week
preceding
the
between
the
last
days
of
july
and
the
first
days
of
august
since
the
temptation
that
in
the
horror
of
the
torrid
noon
before
the
bright
rails
had
traversed
his
soul
like
a
flash
it
even
seemed
to
him
that
the
means
were
already
found
he
had
listened
intently
ceaselessly
to
the
rumbling
of
the
train
and
he
felt
a
strange
unrest
when
the
time
of
its
passage
approached
as
one
of
the
runnels
crossed
the
point
of
the
trabocco
he
could
from
his
pallet
hear
the
dull
noise
that
made
the
entire
eminence
tremble
and
at
times
when
he
was
distracted
by
other
thoughts
he
experienced
a
start
of
fear
as
if
he
had
suddenly
heard
the
rumbling
of
his
destiny
was
it
not
the
same
thought
that
reigned
in
him
and
in
these
taciturn
men
did
not
both
they
and
he
feel
a
similar
chill
in
their
hearts
even
in
the
most
burning
heat
of
the
it
was
perhaps
this
affinity
that
made
him
love
this
place
and
this
company
on
the
musical
waters
he
let
himself
be
lulled
in
the
arms
of
the
phantom
created
by
himself
while
the
will
to
live
grew
gradually
less
as
the
heat
abandons
a
corpse
the
great
calms
of
july
had
come
the
sea
extended
before
the
view
all
white
milky
greenish
here
and
there
in
the
vicinity
of
the
shore
a
mist
slightly
tinted
with
violet
paled
the
distant
coasts
cape
moro
the
nicchiola
cape
ortona
the
vasto
point
the
scarcely
perceptible
undulations
of
the
smooth
sea
produced
between
the
rocks
a
harmony
measured
by
equal
pauses
holding
himself
at
the
extremity
of
one
of
the
long
horizontal
masts
the
child
acted
as
a
lookout
with
watchful
eye
he
scrutinized
beneath
him
the
mirror
of
the
wave
and
from
time
to
time
to
entice
the
frightened
fish
into
entering
the
net
he
threw
a
stone
the
light
splash
of
which
increased
the
surrounding
melancholy
at
times
the
visitor
dozed
beneath
the
caress
of
the
slow
rhythms
these
brief
slumbers
were
the
only
compensation
for
his
sleepless
nights
and
he
had
the
habit
of
pretending
this
need
of
repose
so
that
hippolyte
might
permit
him
to
rest
on
the
trabocco
as
long
as
he
pleased
george
assured
her
that
he
could
not
sleep
elsewhere
than
on
those
planks
amid
the
exhalations
of
the
rocks
amid
the
music
of
the
sea
to
this
music
he
lent
an
ear
more
and
more
attentive
and
subtle
from
now
on
he
knew
all
its
mysteries
understood
all
its
significations
the
feeble
splash
of
the
surf
like
the
lingual
sound
of
a
flock
quenching
its
thirst
the
great
sudden
roar
of
a
giant
wave
which
arriving
from
the
offing
meets
and
breaks
the
wave
refracted
from
the
shore
the
most
humble
note
the
most
superb
note
and
the
innumerable
intermediate
scales
and
the
diverse
measures
of
the
intervals
and
the
most
simple
chords
and
the
most
complex
chords
and
all
the
powers
of
this
profound
marine
orchestra
in
the
sonorous
knew
all
he
understood
all
mysterious
the
twilight
symphony
developed
and
swelled
very
slowly
very
slowly
beneath
a
sky
of
chaste
violets
and
between
the
ethereal
clusters
of
which
shone
the
first
timid
glances
of
the
constellations
still
covered
by
a
veil
here
and
there
errant
breezes
raised
and
pushed
the
billows
rare
at
first
then
more
frequent
then
weaker
they
raised
and
pushed
the
waves
whose
delicate
crests
blossomed
stole
a
glint
from
the
twilight
foamed
a
moment
and
fell
back
languidly
now
like
the
dull
sound
of
cymbals
now
like
the
sound
of
silver
disks
clashed
against
one
another
such
was
the
sound
produced
in
the
silence
by
those
falling
and
expiring
waves
new
billows
arose
engendered
by
a
stronger
gust
curved
limpidly
bore
in
their
curvature
the
grace
of
the
closing
day
broke
with
a
sort
of
indolence
like
restless
white
shedding
their
eaves
and
leaving
durable
foam
like
petals
on
the
mirror
that
stretched
out
where
they
disappeared
forever
still
others
arose
increased
in
velocity
and
strength
approached
the
shore
reached
it
with
a
triumphant
roar
followed
by
a
diffused
murmur
similar
to
the
rustling
of
dry
leaves
and
while
this
illusionary
rustling
of
the
unreal
forest
lasted
other
waves
over
there
over
there
on
the
crescent
of
the
gulf
unfurled
at
constantly
diminishing
distances
to
be
followed
by
the
same
murmur
so
that
the
sonorous
zone
seemed
to
extend
to
the
infinite
by
the
perpetual
vibrations
of
a
myriad
of
dry
leaves
the
water
rushed
on
the
unshakable
rocks
with
the
impetuous
warmth
of
love
or
anger
it
dashed
over
them
roaring
washed
over
them

invaded
with
its
liquidity
the
most
secret
crevices
it
seemed
that
an
natural
soul
was
filling
with
its
frantic
perturbation
an
instrument
as
vast
and
multiple
as
an
organ
guilty
of
every
discordance
touching
all
the
notes
of
joy
and
pain
the
water

it
dashed
to
the
summit
of
the
highest
rock
to
fill
the
little
cavity
round
as
a
votive
cup
it
crept
into
the
oblique
crevice
where
swarmed
the
mollusks
it
sank
into
the
soft
carpets
of
coralline
tearing
them
and
creeping
as
lightly
as
a
serpent
on
a
bed
of
moss
the
regular
dripping
of
the
waters
which
ooze
in
the
occult
cave
the
rhythmic
overflow
of
the
springs
similar
to
the
pulsation
of
a
vast
heart
the
harsh
splashing
of
the
streams
on
the
steep
declivity
the
dull
rumbling
of
the
torrent
imprisoned
between
two
walls
of
granite
the
reiterated
thunder
of
the
river
precipitated
from
the
heights
of
the
these
sounds
produced
by
running
waters
on
the
inert
stone
and
all
the
sports
of
their
echoes
the
sea
imitated
the
tender
word
that
one
murmurs
apart
in
the
shade
the
sigh
exhaled
by
a
mortal
anguish
the
clamor
of
a
multitude
buried
in
the
depths
of
a
catacomb
the
sob
of
a
titanic
bosom
arrogant
and
cruel
these
sounds
produced
by
the
human
mouth
when
sad
or
gay
the
sea
imitated
the
nocturnal
choruses
of
the
spirits
with
the
aërial
tongues
the
whispering
of
the
phantoms
put
to
flight
by
the
dawn
the
suppressed
grins
of
fluid
and
malevolent
creatures
in
ambush
on
the
threshold
of
their
lairs
the
calls
of
vocal
flowers
in
sensual
paradises
the
magic
dance
in
the
these
sounds
that
the
ears
of
the
poets
listen
to
in
secret
all
the
enchantments
of
the
antique
siren
the
sea
imitated
one
and
multiple
elusive
and
imperishable
it
enclosed
in
itself
all
the
languages
of
life
and
dreamland
in
the
attentive
mind
of
the
auditor
it
seemed
like
the
resurrection
of
a
world
the
grandeur
of
the
marine
symphony
revived
in
him
faith
in
the
unlimited
power
of
music
he
was
stupefied
at
having
been
able
to
deprive
his
soul
so
long
of
this
daily
nourishment
of
having
renounced
the
only
means
conceded
to
man
to
free
himself
from
the
deception
of
appearances
and
to
discover
in
the
inner
universe
of
the
soul
the
real
essence
of
things
he
was
stupefied
at
having
been
able
to
neglect
so
long
this
religious
cult
which
after
demetrius
s
example
he
had
practised
with
so
much
fervor
since
the
first
years
of
his
infancy
for
demetrius
and
for
himself
had
not
music
been
a
religion
had
it
not
revealed
to
both
the
mystery
of
the
supreme
life
to
both
it
had
repeated
but
with
a
different
sense
the
words
of
christ
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
and
he
reappeared
to
his
mind
a
mild
meditative
man
with
a
face
full
of
a
virile
melancholy
and
a
single
white
curl
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
among
the
black
hair
giving
him
an
odd
appearance
once
more
george
felt
himself
penetrated
by
the
supernatural
fascination
which
that
man
existing
outside
of
life
exercised
upon
him
from
the
bottom
of
the
tomb
distant
things
came
back
to
his
memory
similar
to
indistinct
waves
of
harmony
elements
of
thought
received
from
that
teacher
seemed
to
take
vague
forms
of
rhythm
the
ideal
sceptre
of
the
defunct
appeared
to
be
transfigured
musically
to
lose
its
visible
outlines
to
reënter
into
the
profound
unity
of
the
being
into
that
being
which
the
solitary
musician
in
the
light
of
his
inspiration
had
discovered
under
the
diversity
of
the
appearances
without
doubt
he
thought
it
is
music
that
initiated
him
into
the
mystery
of
death
that
showed
him
beyond
this
life
a
nocturnal
empire
of
marvels
harmony
an
element
superior
to
time
and
space
had
given
him
like
a
beatitude
a
glimpse
of
the
possibility
of
freeing
himself
from
space
and
time
of
detaching
himself
from
the
individual
will
that
confined
him
in
the
prison
of
a
personality
enclosed
in
a
restricted
place
that
kept
him
perpetually
subject
to
the
brutish
matter
of
corporeal
substance
how
he
had
a
thousand
times
felt
in
himself
in
the
moments
of
inspiration
the
awakening
of
the
universal
will
what
extraordinary
joy
he
had
tasted
on
recognizing
the
supreme
unity
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
things
he
believed
that
death
would
be
a
means
for
prolonging
his
existence
in
the
infinite
that
he
would
become
dissolved
in
the
continuous
harmony
of
the
great
all
and
would
participate
in
the
endless
voluptuousness
of
the
eternal
why
should
i
too
not
have
the
same
initiator
into
the
same
mystery
elevated
images
arose
in
his
mind
at
the
same
time
as
the
stars
appeared
one
by
one
in
the
silence
of
the
heavens
some
of
his
most
poetic
dreams
came
back
to
him
he
recalled
the
immense
sentiment
of
joy
and
liberty
that
he
had
felt
one
day
in
identifying
himself
in
imagination
with
an
unknown
man
who
was
lying
in
a
bier
at
the
summit
of
a
majestic
catafalque
surrounded
by
torches
while
at
the
back
of
the
sacred
shadow
in
the
organ
in
the
orchestra
and
in
the
human
voices
the
soul
of
beethoven
the
divine
teacher
spoke
with
the
invisible
he
saw
once
more
the
chimerical
vessel
laden
with
a
gigantic
organ
that
between
the
sky
and
the
sea
in
infinite
distances
poured
over
the
calm
wave
torrents
of
harmony
from
its
forests
of
tubes
while
twilight
pyres
blazed
on
the
extreme
horizon
or
the
serenity
of
the
moon
spread
all
over
the
ecstatic
sky
or
in
the
circle
of
the
darkness
the
constellations
shone
from
the
heights
of
their
crystal
chariots
he
reconstructed
that
marvellous
temple
of
death
all
of
white
marble
where
remarkable
musicians
stationed
between
the
columns
of
the
propylon
fascinated
with
their
strains
the
young
men
as
they
passed
and
put
so
much
art
in
initiating
them
that
never
did
one
initiated
when
placing
his
foot
on
the
funereal
threshold
look
back
to
salute
the
light
in
which
up
to
then
he
had
found
joy
give
me
a
noble
manner
of
dying
let
beauty
spread
one
of
her
wings
out
under
my
last
step
it
is
all
i
implore
from
my
destiny
a
lyric
breath
expanded
his
thought
the
end
of
percy
shelley
so
often
envied
and
dreamed
of
by
him
under
the
shadow
and
flapping
of
the
sail
reappeared
to
him
in
an
immense
flash
of
poetry
that
destiny
had
superhuman
grandeur
and
sadness
his
death
is
mysterious
and
solemn
as
that
of
the
ancient
heroes
of
greece
which
an
invisible
power
removed
unexpectedly
from
the
earth
and
carried
off
transfigured
into
the
jovian
sphere
as
in
the
song
of
ariel
nothing
of
him
is
destroyed
but
the
sea
has
transfigured
him
into
something
rich
and
strange
his
youthful
body
is
burning
on
a
pyre
at
the
foot
of
the
apennine
before
the
solitude
of
the
tyrrhenian
sea
under
the
blue
arch
of
heaven
he
is
burning
with
aromas
with
incense
with
oil
with
wine
with
salt
the
sonorous
flames
are
rising
in
the
still
air
vibrating
and
chanting
towards
the
sun
a
that
makes
the
marbles
scintillate
on
the
tops
of
the
mountains
as
long
as
the
body
is
not
consumed
a
seagull
circles
the
pyre
with
its
flights
and
then
when
the
body
in
ashes
falls
apart
the
heart
appears
bare
and
intact
had
not
he
too
perhaps
like
the
poet
of
loved
antigone
during
an
anterior
existence
beneath
him
around
him
the
symphony
of
the
sea
swelled
swelled
in
the
shade
and
over
him
the
silence
of
the
starry
sky
grew
deeper
but
from
the
shore
came
a
rumbling
without
resemblance
to
any
other
sound
very
familiar
and
when
he
turned
his
gaze
on
that
side
he
saw
the
two
headlights
of
the
train
like
the
fulguration
of
two
eyes
of
fire
deafening
rapid
and
sinister
the
train
that
passed
shook
the
promontory
in
a
second
it
had
dashed
across
the
open
space
then
whistling
and
roaring
it
disappeared
in
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
opposite
george
started
to
his
feet
he
perceived
that
he
was
alone
on
the
trabocco
george
george
where
are
you
it
was
the
uneasy
cry
of
hippolyte
who
had
come
to
look
for
was
a
cry
of
anguish
and
fear
george
where
are
you
vi
hippolyte
exulted
from
joy
when
george
told
her
of
the
near
arrival
of
the
piano
and
pieces
of
music
how
grateful
she
was
to
him
for
that
kind
surprise
at
last
they
would
have
something
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
long
days
and
to
keep
them
from
temptation
she
laughed
as
she
alluded
to
that
species
of
erotic
fever
with
which
she
maintained
continual
ardor
in
her
lover
she
laughed
as
she
alluded
to
their
carnalism
interrupted
only
by
the
silences
of
lassitude
or
by
some
caprice
of
the
loved
one
in
that
way
she
said
laughing
with
a
touch
of
irony
yet
without
bitterness
in
that
way
you
won
t
have
to
take
refuge
on
your
horrid
trabocco
will
you
she
drew
close
to
him
laid
her
hands
on
his
head
pressed
his
temples
between
her
palms
and
gazed
into
the
depths
of
his
pupils
confess
that
you
took
refuge
there
of
she
murmured
in
a
coaxing
voice
as
if
to
induce
him
to
confess
because
of
what
he
demanded
feeling
under
the
contact
of
her
hands
the
sensation
one
feels
when
one
grows
pale
because
you
are
afraid
of
my
kisses
she
pronounced
the
words
slowly
almost
scanning
the
syllables
and
in
a
voice
which
had
all
at
once
assumed
singular
limpidity
she
had
in
her
look
an
indefinable
mixture
of
passion
irony
cruelty
and
pride
is
it
true
is
it
true
she
insisted
she
continued
to
press
his
temples
between
her
palms
but
gradually
her
fingers
crept
into
his
hair
slightly
tickled
his
ears
descended
to
his
neck
with
one
of
those
multiple
kisses
in
the
science
of
which
she
was
an
accomplished
artist
is
it
true
she
repeated
in
a
subtle
coaxing
tone
that
she
knew
well
by
experience
was
most
efficacious
in
arousing
her
lover
is
it
true
he
did
not
reply
he
closed
his
eyes
he
abandoned
himself
he
felt
life
slipping
world
fading
away
once
more
he
was
succumbing
at
the
mere
contact
of
those
thin
hands
once
more
the
enemy
was
triumphantly
essaying
its
power
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
saying
you
can
not
escape
me
i
know
you
fear
me
but
the
desire
i
arouse
in
you
is
stronger
than
your
terror
and
nothing
intoxicates
me
so
much
as
to
read
that
terror
in
your
eyes
to
surprise
it
in
the
shudder
of
your
fibres
in
the
ingenuousness
of
her
egotism
she
did
not
appear
to
have
the
least
consciousness
of
the
evil
she
was
doing
of
the
work
of
destruction
that
she
was
carrying
on
without
truce
or
mercy
accustomed
as
she
was
to
her
lover
s
melancholies
his
intense
and
mute
contemplations
his
sudden
uneasiness
his
sombre
and
almost
insane
ardor
his
bitter
and
ambiguous
did
not
comprehend
all
the
gravity
of
the
actual
situation
that
she
was
aggravating
more
every
hour
gradually
excluded
from
all
participation
in
george
s
inner
existence
she
had
at
first
by
instinct
and
afterwards
deliberately
made
it
her
study
to
fortify
her
sensual
dominion
over
him
their
new
way
of
life
in
the
open
air
in
the
country
on
the
seashore
favored
the
development
of
her
animalism
aroused
in
her
nature
a
factitious
strength
and
the
need
of
exercising
that
strength
to
excess
complete
idleness
the
absence
of
commonplace
cares
the
continual
presence
of
the
loved
one
the
common
possession
of
the
couch
the
scantiness
of
their
summer
attire
the
daily
those
new
habits
concurred
to
subtilize
and
multiply
her
voluptuous
artifices
at
the
same
time
offering
her
numerous
opportunities
to
repeat
them
and
it
really
seemed
as
if
she
were
making
ample
amends
for
her
coldness
in
the
early
days
and
her
inexperience
of
the
early
months
and
that
she
was
now
corrupting
him
who
had
corrupted
her
she
had
become
so
expert
so
certain
of
her
effects
she
was
so
quick
at
unexpected
inventions
so
graceful
in
her
gestures
and
attitudes
she
showed
at
times
in
the
offer
of
herself
such
violent
frenzy
that
george
could
no
longer
see
in
her
the
bloodless
and
wounded
creature
who
used
to
submit
with
profound
astonishment
the
ignorant
and
frightened
creature
who
had
given
him
that
fierce
and
divine
agony
of
modesty
felled
by
victorious
passion
a
short
time
ago
as
he
had
watched
her
sleeping
he
had
thought
true
sensual
communion
is
also
a
chimera
the
senses
of
my
mistress
are
not
less
obscure
than
her
soul
i
shall
never
succeed
in
surprising
in
her
fibres
a
secret
disgust
an
appetite
unsatisfied
an
irritation
unappeased
i
shall
never
succeed
in
knowing
the
different
sensations
produced
in
her
by
the
same
kiss
repeated
at
different
times
yet
hippolyte
had
acquired
that
science
over
him
she
possessed
that
infallible
science
she
knew
her
lover
s
most
secret
and
subtle
sensibilities
and
knew
how
to
move
them
with
a
marvellous
intuition
of
the
physical
conditions
that
depend
on
them
and
their
corresponding
sensations
and
their
associations
and
their
alternatives
but
the
inextinguishable
desire
that
she
had
enflamed
in
george
burned
her
too
a
sorceress
she
herself
felt
the
effects
of
her
own
spell
the
consciousness
of
her
power
essayed
a
thousand
times
without
failure
intoxicated
her
and
this
ravishment
blinded
her
prevented
her
from
perceiving
the
great
shadow
that
was
thickening
every
day
behind
the
head
of
her
slave
the
terror
that
she
had
surprised
in
george
s
eyes
his
attempts
at
flight
the
thinly
disguised
hostilities
excited
her
instead
of
restraining
her
her
artificial
taste
for
transcendent
life
for
extraordinary
things
for
mystery
tastes
that
george
had
educated
in
her
took
pleasure
in
these
symptoms
significant
of
a
deep
change
formerly
her
lover
separated
from
her
tortured
by
the
anguish
of
desire
and
jealousy
had
written
her
is
that
love
oh
no
it
is
a
sort
of
monstrous
infirmity
that
can
blossom
in
for
my
joy
and
my
martyrdom
i
love
to
think
that
no
other
human
creature
has
experienced
that
feeling
she
was
proud
at
having
aroused
such
a
sentiment
in
a
man
so
different
from
the
commonplace
men
she
had
known
she
became
exalted
as
she
recognized
hour
by
hour
the
strange
effects
of
her
exclusive
domination
on
this
man
and
she
had
no
other
object
than
to
exercise
her
tyranny
with
a
mixture
of
levity
and
seriousness
passing
by
turns
from
playfulness
to
wilful
abuse
vii
sometimes
when
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
contemplating
the
unconscious
woman
standing
near
the
calm
and
perilous
waves
george
thought
i
could
easily
cause
her
death
she
often
tries
to
swim
leaning
on
me
i
could
easily
smother
her
under
the
water
let
her
drown
no
suspicion
would
attach
to
me
the
crime
would
appear
like
an
accident
only
then
in
front
of
the
corpse
of
the
enemy
should
i
have
an
opportunity
to
find
the
solution
of
my
problem
since
she
is
now
the
centre
of
all
my
existence
what
change
would
take
place
in
me
after
her
disappearance
have
i
not
more
than
once
experienced
a
feeling
of
peace
and
liberty
in
thinking
of
her
as
dead
enclosed
forever
in
the
tomb
perhaps
i
should
succeed
in
saving
myself
and
reconquering
life
if
i
made
the
enemy
perish
if
i
removed
the
obstacle
he
dwelt
on
this
thought
he
tried
to
construct
a
representation
of
his
being
freed
and
appeased
in
a
future
without
love
he
took
pleasure
in
enveloping
his
mistress
s
sensual
body
in
a
fantastic
shroud
hippolyte
was
timid
in
the
water
during
her
swimming
lessons
she
never
ventured
beyond
her
depth
a
sudden
terror
seized
her
when
on
resuming
the
vertical
position
she
did
not
at
once
feel
ground
under
her
feet
george
urged
her
to
venture
with
his
help
as
far
as
a
rock
situated
a
short
distance
from
the
shore
about
twenty
strokes
from
her
depth
very
slight
effort
was
necessary
to
swim
there
be
brave
he
kept
repeating
to
convince
her
you
ll
never
learn
unless
you
are
courageous
i
ll
stay
near
you
thus
he
enveloped
her
with
his
homicidal
thought
and
he
had
a
long
inner
thrill
each
time
during
the
incidents
of
the
bath
that
he
became
convinced
of
the
extreme
facility
with
which
he
could
carry
his
thoughts
into
effect
but
the
necessary
energy
failed
him
and
he
confined
himself
to
proposing
the
swim
to
the
rock
and
leaving
the
rest
to
chance
in
his
present
weak
condition
he
himself
would
be
in
peril
if
hippolyte
seized
by
fright
took
violent
hold
of
him
but
such
a
probability
did
not
dissuade
him
from
making
the
attempt
on
the
contrary
it
made
him
more
determined
to
do
so
be
brave
can
not
you
see
that
the
rock
is
so
near
that
we
can
almost
touch
it
with
our
hands
swim
slowly
by
my
side
you
can
rest
when
you
re
there
we
ll
sit
down
we
ll
gather
some
coral
come
be
brave
he
dissimulated
his
own
anxiety
with
difficulty
she
resisted
undecided
wavering
between
fear
and
caprice
suppose
my
strength
gives
out
i
ll
be
there
to
help
you
and
if
your
strength
isn
t
sufficient
it
will
be
you
see
how
close
the
rock
is
smiling
she
touched
her
lips
with
her
wet
fingers
the
water
is
so
salt
she
said
pouting
then
her
last
repugnance
overcome
she
suddenly
made
up
her
mind
come
i
m
ready
her
heart
did
not
beat
so
fast
as
the
heart
of
her
companion
as
the
water
was
very
calm
almost
motionless
the
first
strokes
were
easy
but
suddenly
through
lack
of
experience
she
began
to
hurry
and
blow
herself
a
false
movement
filled
her
mouth
with
water
panic
seized
her
she
cried
struggled
drank
in
more
help
george
help
instinctively
he
dashed
to
her
aid
and
caught
hold
of
the
shrivelled
fingers
that
clutched
him
under
the
clutch
and
weight
he
weakened
and
he
had
a
sudden
vision
of
the
foreseen
end
don
t
hold
me
like
that
he
cried
don
t
hold
me
like
that
leave
me
an
arm
free
the
brutal
instinct
of
restored
his
strength
he
made
an
extraordinary
effort
swam
the
short
distance
with
his
burden
and
he
touched
the
rock
his
strength
exhausted
cling
hold
he
said
to
hippolyte
unable
to
raise
her
himself
finding
herself
safe
she
had
recovered
her
promptness
of
action
but
barely
seated
on
the
rocks
gasping
and
dripping
she
burst
into
sobs
she
cried
violently
like
a
child
and
her
sobs
exasperated
george
instead
of
touching
him
he
had
never
seen
her
cry
such
a
torrent
of
tears
with
such
swollen
and
burning
eyes
making
such
a
grimace
he
thought
her
ugly
and
pusillanimous
he
felt
an
angry
rancor
toward
her
and
at
heart
almost
a
regret
for
having
given
himself
that
trouble
and
taken
her
from
the
water
he
imagined
her
drowned
disappeared
in
the
sea
he
imagined
his
own
emotion
on
seeing
her
disappear
and
then
the
signs
of
grief
that
he
would
give
in
public
his
attitude
in
front
of
the
cadaver
cast
up
by
the
waves
stupefied
at
seeing
herself
left
to
her
tears
without
a
consoling
word
she
turned
toward
him
she
had
stopped
crying
what
shall
i
do
to
get
back
she
asked
make
another
attempt
he
answered
with
a
touch
of
mockery
no
no
never
what
then
i
ll
stay
here
very
well
addio
and
he
made
a
gesture
as
if
to
dive
in
the
sea
addio
i
ll
shout
they
ll
come
and
rescue
me
she
passed
from
sobbing
to
laughter
her
eyes
still
full
of
tears
what
s
that
on
your
arm
she
asked
the
marks
of
your
nails
he
showed
her
the
bleeding
scratches
do
they
hurt
she
felt
sorry
and
stroked
the
arm
with
her
hand
it
was
your
yours
wasn
t
it
she
continued
you
made
me
come
i
didn
t
want
then
smiling
it
was
perhaps
a
way
to
get
rid
of
me
a
shudder
ran
through
her
what
a
horrible
death
the
water
is
so
bitter
she
bent
her
head
down
to
one
side
and
felt
the
water
run
from
her
ear
warm
as
the
blood
the
rock
was
hot
brownish
and
slippery
like
the
back
of
a
living
animal
and
at
its
base
it
swarmed
with
infinite
life
the
green
vegetation
undulated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
with
the
suppleness
of
unloosened
hair
with
a
light
splashing
sound
the
solitary
rock
which
received
the
heavenly
heat
exercised
a
sort
of
seduction
and
communicated
it
to
its
people
of
happy
creatures
as
if
allowing
himself
to
be
won
by
this
seduction
george
stretched
himself
out
on
his
back
for
a
few
seconds
he
applied
his
consciousness
to
perceive
the
vague
feeling
of
comfort
that
penetrated
his
wet
skin
drying
in
the
heat
emanated
from
the
stones
and
in
that
of
the
direct
rays
phantoms
of
distant
sensations
came
back
to
his
memory
the
thought
of
the
chaste
baths
of
formerly
of
the
long
apathies
on
the
sand
more
ardent
and
more
suave
than
a
female
body
oh
for
solitude
liberty
love
without
the
accessories
love
for
dead
or
inaccessible
women
hippolyte
s
presence
prohibited
forgetfulness
recalled
incessantly
the
image
of
the
physical
relation
of
the
accouplement
operated
by
ignoble
organs
of
the
infecund
and
sad
spasm
which
had
since
become
the
unique
manifestation
of
their
love
of
what
are
you
thinking
asked
hippolyte
touching
him
do
you
want
to
stay
here
he
rose
he
replied
let
s
go
the
life
of
the
enemy
was
still
in
his
hands
he
could
still
destroy
it
he
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
him
a
heavy
silence
hung
over
the
hill
and
the
beach
on
the
trabocco
the
taciturn
fishermen
were
watching
their
net
come
be
brave
he
repeated
smiling
no
no
never
again
let
s
stay
here
then
no
let
s
call
the
men
of
the
trabocco
they
ll
laugh
at
us
very
well
i
ll
call
them
myself
if
you
didn
t
get
you
didn
t
clutch
me
so
i
should
be
strong
enough
to
carry
you
no
no
i
want
to
go
back
in
the
fannizza
she
was
so
determined
that
george
let
her
have
her
way
he
stood
up
on
the
rock
and
making
a
speaking
trumpet
of
his
hands
he
called
one
of
turchin
s
sons
daniel
daniel
on
hearing
this
repeated
shout
one
of
the
fishermen
left
the
capstan
crossed
the
bridge
climbed
down
and
began
to
run
along
the
beach
daniel
bring
the
the
man
heard
turned
back
went
toward
the
boathouse
dragged
the
little
dingy
into
the
water
and
pushing
off
with
a
long
pole
proceeded
towards
the
rock
viii
the
next
was
a
seated
beneath
the
oak
was
listening
to
old
colas
who
was
relating
how
several
days
before
at
tocco
casauria
the
new
messiah
had
been
arrested
by
the
police
and
led
to
the
saint
valentine
prison
with
several
of
his
disciples
the
old
man
said
shaking
his
head
our
lord
jesus
christ
himself
suffered
from
the
hate
of
the
pharisees
oreste
came
into
the
district
to
bring
peace
and
abundance
and
they
put
him
in
prison
o
father
don
t
grieve
cried
candia
the
messiah
can
leave
the
prison
when
he
wishes
to
and
we
ll
see
him
again
here
wait
and
see
she
was
leaning
against
the
supporting
without
fatigue
the
weight
of
her
peaceful
maternity
and
in
her
large
ashen
eyes
shone
an
infinite
serenity
all
at
once
albadora
the
septuagenarian
sibyl
who
had
brought
into
the
world
children
remounted
to
the
court
by
the
path
and
pointing
to
the
neighboring
shore
of
the
left
promontory
she
announced
deeply
moved
a
child
has
been
drowned
yonder
candia
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
george
rose
and
ascended
to
the
loggia
in
order
to
observe
the
point
indicated
on
the
beach
at
the
foot
of
the
promontory
near
the
reefs
and
the
tunnel
there
was
a
white
spot
doubtless
the
cloth
that
covered
the
little
corpse
a
group
of
people
stood
close
by
as
hippolyte
had
gone
to
mass
with
helen
to
the
chapel
of
the
port
he
was
curious
to
go
down
and
said
to
his
hosts
i
ll
go
and
see
why
do
you
want
to
put
a
pain
in
your
heart
asked
candia
he
turned
quickly
into
the
path
took
a
short
cut
to
the
beach
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
sea
on
arriving
at
the
place
of
the
accident
he
was
panting
a
little
he
asked
what
has
happened
the
assembled
peasants
saluted
him
making
room
for
him
one
of
them
answered
calm
it
s
the
of
a
who
s
been
drowned
another
clothed
in
linen
who
appeared
to
be
in
charge
of
the
corpse
stooped
and
raised
the
cloth
the
little
body
appeared
inert
stretched
on
the
hard
beach
it
was
the
body
of
a
child
of
eight
or
nine
a
thin
and
frail
blond
for
a
pillow
they
had
put
beneath
his
head
his
poor
rags
rolled
up
in
a
bundle
his
shirt
blue
breeches
red
belt
soft
felt
hat
his
face
was
scarcely
livid
with
a
snub
nose
prominent
forehead
very
long
eyelashes
a
mouth
with
large
lips
between
which
showed
the
white
teeth
spaced
one
from
another
his
neck
was
thin
flaccid
like
a
withered
stem
marked
with
tiny
folds
the
tendons
of
the
arm
were
weak
the
arms
were
slender
covered
with
a
down
like
the
fine
feathers
that
cover
a
newly
hatched
bird
his
ribs
were
prominent
and
distinct
a
darker
line
divided
the
skin
in
the
middle
of
the
chest
the
umbilicus
protruded
like
a
knot
the
feet
a
little
swollen
had
the
same
yellowish
color
as
the
hands
and
the
small
hands
were
callous
covered
with
warts
with
white
nails
that
were
beginning
to
turn
livid
on
the
left
arm
on
the
thighs
near
the
groin
and
lower
down
on
the
knees
along
the
limbs
reddish
spots
appeared
all
the
particularities
of
this
miserable
body
assumed
an
extraordinary
significance
in
george
s
eyes
immobilized
as
they
were
and
fixed
forever
in
the
rigidity
of
death
how
did
he
get
drowned
where
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
the
man
clad
in
linen
began
not
without
some
signs
of
impatience
the
story
that
doubtless
he
had
already
repeated
too
often
he
had
a
square
bestial
face
hairy
eyebrows
and
a
broad
hard
fierce
mouth
the
story
he
told
was
as
follows
immediately
after
having
taken
his
sheep
back
to
the
barn
the
child
had
eaten
his
lunch
and
had
gone
down
to
bathe
in
company
with
a
comrade
but
scarcely
had
he
put
foot
in
the
water
than
he
fell
and
was
drowned
at
his
comrade
s
cries
someone
had
run
from
the
house
built
on
the
cliffs
and
had
drawn
him
out
without
getting
wet
above
the
knees
he
had
lowered
the
head
to
cause
vomiting
had
shaken
him
but
uselessly
and
so
as
to
illustrate
just
where
the
poor
little
fellow
had
gone
down
the
man
picked
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
into
the
sea
there
just
arms
length
from
the
shore
the
calm
sea
breathed
softly
near
the
head
of
the
little
corpse
but
the
sun
blazed
on
the
beach
and
in
presence
of
this
pallid
corpse
there
seemed
something
implacable
in
that
burning
sky
and
these
coarse
witnesses
george
asked
why
don
t
you
carry
him
into
the
shade
to
a
house
a
bed
he
mustn
t
be
moved
replied
the
guardian
sententiously
until
the
arrival
of
the
authorities
he
must
not
be
moved
but
at
least
carry
him
into
the
under
that
embankment
obstinately
the
guardian
repeated
he
must
not
be
moved
and
nothing
could
be
more
sad
than
that
frail
lifeless
creature
stretched
on
the
strand
and
guarded
by
that
impassive
brute
who
always
repeated
the
same
tale
in
the
same
words
who
always
made
the
same
motion
when
throwing
the
stone
into
the
sea
there
just
there
a
woman
came
up
a
scold
with
hard
eyes
and
a
bitter
comrade
s
mother
one
could
plainly
see
on
her
features
a
suspicious
anxiety
as
if
she
feared
an
accusation
against
her
own
son
she
spoke
sourly
and
displayed
almost
irritation
against
the
victim
it
was
his
fate
god
told
him
go
in
the
sea
and
she
gesticulated
vehemently
why
did
he
go
in
when
he
couldn
t
swim
a
child
who
did
not
belong
to
the
district
a
boatman
s
son
repeated
disdainfully
why
did
he
go
in
yes
we
fellows
all
know
how
to
swim
people
came
up
looked
on
with
cold
curiosity
stopped
or
passed
on
one
group
occupied
the
railway
embankment
another
group
was
looking
from
the
top
of
the
promontory
as
at
a
spectacle
children
seated
or
kneeling
played
with
the
little
pebbles
that
they
threw
in
the
air
to
catch
them
alternately
on
the
backs
of
their
hands
and
in
their
palms
everyone
displayed
profound
indifference
at
the
sight
of
another
s
misfortune
and
at
death
another
woman
on
her
way
back
from
mass
came
up
in
a
silk
dress
decked
with
all
her
gold
trinkets
to
her
also
the
weary
guardian
repeated
his
story
and
showed
the
place
in
the
water
this
woman
was
loquacious
i
always
say
to
my
children
don
t
go
near
the
sea
or
i
ll
kill
the
sea
is
the
sea
you
can
t
save
yourself
she
related
stories
of
drowned
people
she
recalled
the
case
of
the
headless
corpse
that
the
sea
had
thrown
up
at
san
vito
and
which
a
child
had
discovered
among
the
rocks
there
between
those
rocks
you
see
the
child
came
running
up
saying
there
s
a
dead
we
thought
he
was
joking
all
the
same
we
went
and
we
found
it
the
body
had
no
head
the
authorities
came
they
buried
him
in
a
ditch
then
at
night
he
was
taken
up
again
he
was
all
mangled
and
decomposed
but
he
still
had
his
shoes
on
his
feet
the
magistrate
said
look
they
are
better
than
he
must
be
a
rich
man
and
he
was
a
he
had
been
assassinated
they
had
cut
his
head
off
and
thrown
him
into
the
tronto
she
continued
in
a
shrill
treble
swallowing
the
excessive
saliva
from
time
to
time
with
a
light
whistling
sound
where
s
the
mother
when
will
the
mother
come
all
the
assembled
women
uttered
exclamations
of
pity
at
that
name
the
mother
the
mother
will
come
they
all
turned
around
thinking
they
saw
her
in
the
distance
on
the
burning
sand
others
gave
information
concerning
her
her
name
was
riccangela
she
was
a
widow
with
seven
children
she
had
placed
this
one
with
the
farmers
to
feed
the
sheep
and
earn
his
bread
one
was
saying
as
she
looked
at
the
corpse
his
mother
had
so
much
trouble
to
raise
him
another
said
she
has
even
begged
alms
so
as
to
nourish
her
children
a
third
told
that
several
months
previously
the
poor
youngster
had
already
come
near
drowning
himself
in
a
three
inches
of
water
everyone
repeated
it
was
his
destiny
he
was
to
die
so
waiting
rendered
them
uneasy
anxious
the
mother
the
mother
s
coming
george
deeply
affected
cried
carry
him
into
the
shade
won
t
you
or
into
a
house
so
that
his
mother
will
not
see
him
naked
on
the
sand
in
the
broiling
sun
the
guardian
objected
obstinately
he
mustn
t
be
moved
until
the
arrival
of
the
authorities
he
mustn
t
be
moved
the
assistants
looked
at
s
with
surprise
their
number
increased
some
occupied
the
embankment
planted
with
acacias
others
crowned
the
arid
promontory
rearing
up
perpendicularly
above
the
rocks
here
and
there
lying
on
the
great
monstrous
blocks
clumps
of
reeds
shone
like
gold
at
the
foot
of
the
enormous
slide
of
the
cliffs
resembling
a
ruin
of
a
cyclopean
tower
in
front
of
the
immense
sea
suddenly
above
the
heights
a
voice
announced
here
she
is
other
voices
followed
the
mother
the
mother
everybody
turned
round
some
came
down
from
the
embankment
those
on
the
promontory
leaned
forward
expectation
rendered
all
dumb
the
guardian
recovered
the
corpse
with
the
cloth
in
the
silence
the
sea
scarcely
gasped
the
acacias
scarcely
rustled
and
then
in
the
silence
one
heard
the
cries
of
the
new
arrival
the
mother
came
along
the
shore
in
the
sun
crying
she
was
dressed
in
widow
s
weeds
her
body
bent
she
stumbled
along
on
the
sand
crying
my
son
my
son
she
raised
her
hands
to
heaven
crying
my
son
one
of
her
older
sons
with
a
red
handkerchief
knotted
about
his
neck
followed
her
with
a
stupefied
air
wiping
away
his
tears
with
the
back
of
his
hand
she
walked
along
the
shore
bent
striking
her
knees
directing
her
steps
toward
the
white
cloth
and
while
she
called
the
dead
her
mouth
uttered
cries
that
had
nothing
human
about
them
like
the
yelping
of
a
savage
dog
the
nearer
she
came
the
lower
she
bent
almost
stooping
on
all
fours
when
she
reached
the
body
she
threw
herself
on
the
cloth
with
a
shriek
she
arose
with
her
coarse
and
blackened
hand
a
hand
hardened
by
every
toil
she
uncovered
the
corpse
she
looked
at
it
for
a
few
instants
motionless
as
if
petrified
then
several
times
in
a
piercing
voice
with
all
the
force
of
her
lungs
she
cried
as
if
to
awaken
the
dead
my
son
my
son
my
son
the
sobs
choked
her
on
her
knees
furious
she
struck
her
sides
with
her
fists
her
hopeless
gaze
wandered
around
on
the
people
present
and
during
a
lull
in
that
violent
tempest
she
seemed
to
collect
herself
then
she
began
to
chant
she
chanted
her
sorrow
in
a
rhythm
that
rose
and
fell
regularly
like
the
palpitation
of
a
heart
it
was
an
ancient
monody
that
from
time
immemorial
in
the
region
of
the
abruzzi
the
women
chanted
over
the
loss
of
their
kin
it
was
the
melodious
eloquence
of
the
sacred
sorrow
that
spontaneously
wells
up
from
the
depths
of
the
being
that
hereditary
rhythm
in
which
the
mothers
of
other
times
had
modulated
their
lament
she
chanted
chanted
open
your
eyes
arise
walk
my
son
how
beautiful
you
are
how
beautiful
you
are
she
chanted
for
a
morsel
of
bread
i
have
drowned
you
my
son
for
a
morsel
of
bread
i
sent
you
to
death
it
was
for
this
then
that
i
raised
you
but
the
woman
with
the
hooked
nose
interrupted
her
snappishly
no
you
have
not
drowned
him
it
was
destiny
no
you
didn
t
send
him
to
his
death
put
it
in
the
midst
of
the
and
with
a
gesture
towards
the
hill
on
which
stood
the
house
that
had
given
hospitality
to
the
child
she
added
they
took
care
of
him
there
a
jewel
in
its
the
mother
continued
o
my
son
who
sent
you
here
who
sent
you
here
to
be
drowned
and
the
snappy
woman
who
sent
him
it
was
our
lord
he
said
to
him
go
into
the
sea
and
as
george
observed
in
a
low
voice
to
one
of
the
bystanders
that
the
child
succored
in
time
could
have
been
saved
and
that
they
had
killed
him
by
putting
his
head
low
and
suspending
him
by
the
feet
he
felt
the
mother
s
gaze
fixed
on
himself
do
something
for
him
signor
she
implored
do
something
for
him
she
prayed
o
madonna
of
miracles
perform
the
miracle
she
repeated
touching
the
head
of
the
dead
my
son
my
son
my
son
arise
walk
before
her
on
his
knees
was
the
brother
of
the
dead
child
and
he
sobbed
with
grief
gazing
about
him
from
time
to
time
with
a
face
that
had
suddenly
become
indifferent
another
brother
the
eldest
remained
seated
near
by
in
the
shadow
of
a
rock
and
he
simulated
grief
by
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
in
order
to
console
the
mother
the
women
bent
around
her
with
gestures
of
pity
and
accompanied
the
monody
with
a
few
groans
she
chanted
why
did
i
send
you
away
from
my
house
why
have
i
sent
you
to
your
death
i
have
done
everything
to
feed
my
sons
everything
but
sold
myself
and
it
is
for
a
morsel
of
bread
that
i
have
lost
you
that
that
is
how
you
were
to
end
they
have
drowned
you
my
son
then
the
woman
with
the
rapacious
nose
in
a
burst
of
anger
raised
her
skirt
entered
the
water
as
far
as
the
knees
and
cried
look
he
went
in
this
far
look
the
water
is
like
oil
it
is
a
sign
that
he
was
to
die
in
this
manner
and
she
regained
the
shore
in
two
long
strides
look
look
she
repeated
pointing
out
on
the
sand
the
deep
imprints
of
the
man
who
had
drawn
out
the
body
the
mother
looked
on
in
a
stupor
but
one
would
have
said
that
she
did
not
see
that
she
understood
nothing
after
the
hopeless
explosions
of
grief
there
supervened
in
her
short
pauses
like
the
dulling
of
consciousness
she
remained
silent
she
touched
her
foot
or
leg
mechanically
she
dried
her
tears
with
her
black
apron
she
seemed
to
become
composed
then
suddenly
a
new
explosion
shook
her
entire
frame
she
fell
on
the
corpse
and
i
can
not
take
you
away
i
can
not
take
you
in
my
arms
to
the
church
my
son
my
son
she
felt
him
from
head
to
foot
with
a
slow
caress
her
wild
anguish
became
more
gentle
more
touching
her
hand
sunburnt
and
callous
by
work
became
infinitely
coaxing
when
she
touched
her
son
s
eyes
mouth
and
forehead
how
beautiful
you
are
how
beautiful
you
are
she
touched
his
lower
lip
already
and
this
slight
pressure
caused
a
flow
of
whitish
foam
to
flow
from
the
mouth
she
removed
from
between
the
eyelashes
a
bit
of
straw
gently
gently
as
if
she
feared
to
hurt
him
how
beautiful
you
are
you
mother
s
pet
the
eyelashes
of
the
child
were
very
long
and
very
blond
on
the
temples
on
the
cheeks
a
light
down
gave
a
golden
reflection
don
t
you
hear
me
arise
walk
she
took
the
little
hat
worn
soft
as
a
rag
she
gazed
on
him
kissed
him
she
said
i
want
to
keep
this
as
a
relic
i
want
to
carry
it
always
on
my
heart
she
took
the
red
waistband
and
said
i
wish
to
dress
you
the
rough
woman
who
had
not
left
her
place
approved
yes
let
us
dress
him
she
herself
removed
the
clothes
from
beneath
the
head
of
the
corpse
felt
in
the
vest
pocket
and
found
there
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
fig
you
see
they
had
just
given
him
his
meal
they
took
care
of
him
there
a
jewel
in
its
the
mother
looked
at
the
little
shirt
dirty
torn
on
which
her
tears
were
falling
and
she
said
put
this
shirt
on
him
promptly
the
woman
shouted
up
to
one
of
her
people
on
the
heights
above
bring
quickly
one
of
nufrillo
s
clean
shirts
the
clean
shirt
was
brought
when
the
mother
raised
the
small
body
a
little
water
came
from
the
mouth
and
rolled
down
the
chest
o
madonna
of
miracles
perform
the
miracle
she
prayed
raising
her
eyes
to
heaven
in
a
supreme
supplication
then
she
laid
her
sweet
burden
down
again
she
took
the
old
shirt
the
red
waistband
the
hat
she
rolled
them
all
up
into
a
bundle
and
said
it
will
be
my
pillow
at
night
i
shall
rest
my
head
on
it
i
want
to
die
on
it
she
placed
the
poor
relic
on
the
sand
near
the
child
s
head
placed
her
temple
on
it
and
stretched
out
as
if
on
a
bed
they
both
lay
there
side
by
side
the
mother
and
son
on
the
hard
stones
beneath
the
burning
sky
near
the
homicidal
sea
and
she
chanted
the
same
cantilena
that
had
formerly
shed
a
chaste
slumber
over
the
cradle
get
up
riccangela
get
up
repeated
the
women
around
her
she
was
not
listening
to
them
my
son
is
lying
on
the
stones
and
i
could
not
rest
there
too
oh
my
son
on
these
stones
get
up
riccangela
come
she
rose
she
gazed
once
more
and
with
terrible
intensity
on
the
livid
face
of
the
corpse
she
called
once
more
with
all
the
force
of
her
lungs
my
son
my
son
my
son
then
with
her
own
hands
she
her
heavy
loss
with
the
cloth
and
the
women
surrounded
her
drew
her
a
little
farther
away
under
the
shade
of
a
rock
forced
her
to
sit
down
lamented
with
her
gradually
the
spectators
disbanded
dispersed
there
remained
only
a
few
consolers
and
also
the
man
clothed
in
linen
the
impassive
guardian
who
waited
for
the
authorities
the
canicular
sun
beat
down
on
the
beach
and
imparted
to
the
funereal
cloth
a
dazzling
whiteness
the
promontory
perpendicular
above
the
jagged
rocks
towered
up
in
the
conflagration
with
its
desolate
aridity
the
sea
immense
and
green
breathed
always
evenly
and
it
seemed
that
the
slow
hour
would
never
end
in
the
shade
of
the
rock
before
the
white
cloth
raised
by
the
rigid
form
of
the
corpse
the
mother
continued
her
monody
in
the
rhythm
rendered
sacred
by
so
many
sorrows
ancient
and
recent
of
her
race
and
it
seemed
as
if
her
lamentation
would
never
cease
ix
on
her
return
from
the
chapel
of
the
port
hippolyte
had
heard
of
the
accident
accompanied
by
helen
she
had
wished
to
rejoin
george
on
the
beach
but
when
near
the
tragic
spot
at
the
sight
of
the
cloth
that
made
a
white
spot
on
the
sand
she
had
felt
her
strength
fail
her
seized
by
an
outburst
of
sobs
she
had
retraced
her
steps
had
gone
back
to
the
house
had
waited
for
george
weeping
she
felt
less
compassion
for
the
little
body
than
she
felt
for
herself
haunted
by
the
recollection
of
the
peril
she
had
so
lately
incurred
at
the
bath
and
an
instinctive
indomitable
repulsion
arose
in
her
against
that
sea
i
do
not
want
to
bathe
in
the
sea
any
more
i
do
not
want
you
to
bathe
there
she
enjoined
george
almost
roughly
in
a
tone
that
expressed
a
firm
unyielding
resolution
i
will
not
have
it
do
you
hear
they
passed
the
rest
of
that
sunday
in
an
anxious
restlessness
returning
ceaselessly
to
the
loggia
to
look
at
the
white
spot
over
there
on
the
beach
george
had
the
image
of
the
corpse
constantly
before
his
eyes
so
strongly
outlined
that
it
seemed
to
him
almost
tangible
and
in
his
ears
was
constantly
the
cadence
of
the
monody
chanted
by
the
mother
was
the
mother
still
lamenting
in
the
shade
of
the
rock
had
she
stayed
there
alone
with
the
sea
and
the
dead
he
saw
again
in
imagination
another
unfortunate
he
relived
the
hour
of
that
may
morning
long
ago
in
the
house
far
away
when
he
had
felt
all
at
once
the
maternal
life
come
in
contact
with
his
own
life
with
a
sort
of
adherence
when
he
had
felt
the
mysterious
correspondences
of
blood
of
sorrow
and
of
destiny
suspended
over
the
heads
of
both
would
he
ever
see
her
again
with
mortal
eyes
would
he
ever
again
see
that
feeble
smile
which
without
changing
a
line
of
the
face
seemed
to
spread
a
light
veil
of
hope
too
fugitive
alas
over
the
indelible
imprints
of
pain
would
it
be
permitted
him
ever
to
kiss
that
long
and
emaciated
hand
again
whose
caress
could
be
compared
to
no
other
and
he
relived
the
distant
hour
of
the
tears
when
at
the
window
he
had
received
the
terrible
revelation
from
the
glimmer
of
a
smile
when
he
had
at
last
heard
the
dear
voice
the
only
and
unforgettable
voice
the
voice
of
comfort
of
counsel
of
forgiveness
of
infinite
he
had
at
last
recognized
the
tender
creature
of
long
ago
the
adored
one
and
he
relived
the
hour
of
the
farewell
the
farewell
tearless
and
yet
so
cruel
when
he
had
lied
for
shame
on
reading
in
his
deceived
mother
s
eyes
the
too
sad
question
for
whom
are
you
abandoning
me
and
all
the
past
sorrows
arose
again
in
his
memory
with
all
their
dolorous
images
that
emaciated
face
those
swollen
eyelids
red
and
burning
christine
s
gentle
and
smile
the
sickly
child
whose
large
head
was
always
resting
on
a
chest
barren
of
all
but
sighs
the
cadaveric
mask
of
the
poor
idiotic
gormand
and
the
tired
eyes
of
his
mother
repeated
for
whom
are
you
abandoning
me
he
felt
himself
penetrated
by
a
wave
of
gentle
feeling
he
languished
dissolved
he
felt
a
vague
desire
to
bend
his
forehead
to
hide
his
face
on
a
bosom
to
be
caressed
chastely
to
savor
slowly
this
secret
bitterness
to
doze
to
perish
gradually
it
was
as
if
all
the
effeminations
of
his
soul
had
blossomed
at
the
same
time
and
were
floating
a
man
passed
by
on
the
path
bearing
on
his
head
a
little
coffin
later
in
the
afternoon
the
authorities
arrived
at
the
beach
the
little
corpse
lifted
up
away
from
the
stones
had
been
carried
to
the
heights
disappeared
piercing
shrieks
reached
the
hermitage
then
all
was
quiet
the
silence
ascending
from
the
calm
sea
regained
possession
of
the
surrounding
parts
the
sea
was
so
calm
the
air
was
so
calm
that
life
seemed
suspended
a
bluish
light
spread
uniformly
over
everything

had
reëntered
and
had
thrown
herself
on
her
bed
george
remained
in
the
loggia
seated
on
a
chair
both
suffered
and
they
could
not
speak
of
their
pain
time
slipped
by
did
you
call
me
asked
george
who
thought
he
heard
his
name
no
i
didn
t
call
you
she
answered
what
are
you
doing
are
you
going
to
sleep
she
did
not
answer
george
reseated
himself
and
his
eyes
his
thoughts
always
went
back
towards
the
mountain
in
this
silence
he
felt
the
silence
of
the
solitary
and
abandoned
garden
in
which
the
little
tall
and
straight
reared
up
motionless
toward
the
sky
religiously
like
votive
wax
candles
from
which
through
the
windows
of
the
deserted
chambers
still
intact
like
reliquaries
came
a
religious
sweetness
of
recollections
and
he
appeared
to
him
a
mild
meditative
man
with
a
face
full
of
a
virile
melancholy
and
a
single
white
curl
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
among
the
black
hair
giving
him
an
odd
appearance
oh
why
said
he
to
demetrius
why
did
i
not
obey
your
suggestion
the
last
time
i
entered
the
chambers
inhabited
by
your
spirit
why
did
i
wish
to
make
a
new
trial
of
life
and
cover
myself
with
shame
before
your
eyes
how
could
i
have
made
the
mistake
of
pursuing
the
of
another
soul
when
i
possessed
yours
and
when
you
lived
in
me
after
the
physical
death
the
soul
of
demetrius
had
been
preserved
in
the
survivor
without
any
diminution
and
in
him
it
had
even
attained
and
retained
its
supreme
intensity
all
that
the
living
person
had
consumed
in
contact
with
his
fellows
all
the
words
sown
in
the
course
of
time
all
the
diverse
manifestations
that
had
determined
the
special
character
of
his
being
compared
with
other
beings
all
the
ways
constant
or
variable
that
had
distinguished
his
personality
among
other
personalities
and
made
of
him
a
man
apart
in
the
human
multitude
in
short
all
that
had
differentiated
his
own
life
from
other
that
was
collected
concentrated
circumscribed
in
the
unique
ideal
tie
that
attached
the
defunct
to
the
survivor
and
the
divine
ostensory
preserved
in
the
duomo
of
the
natal
town
seemed
to
consecrate
this
high
mystery
demetrius
aurispa
et
unicus
georgius
filius
the
impure
creature
who
was
now
lying
on
that
unchaste
bed
had
interposed
between
the
terrible
corrupter
was
not
only
the
obstacle
to
life
but
also
an
obstacle
to
that
she
was
the
enemy
of
both
and
george
in
thought
returned
to
the
mountain
once
more
reached
the
old
mansion
reëntered
the
deserted
rooms
as
on
that
may
morning
he
crossed
the
tragic
threshold
and
as
on
that
day
he
felt
the
obscure
obsession
over
his
will
the
fifth
anniversary
was
near
in
what
manner
should
he
celebrate
it
a
sudden
cry
from
hippolyte
made
him
start
violently
he
jumped
up
and
ran
what
s
the
matter
seated
up
in
bed
terrified
she
was
passing
her
hands
over
her
brow
and
eyelids
as
though
to
thrust
off
something
that
tormented
her
she
fixed
large
haggard
eyes
on
her
lover
then
with
an
abrupt
gesture
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
covered
his
face
with
kisses
and
tears
what
s
the
matter
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
astonished
uneasy
nothing
why
are
you
crying
i
had
a
what
did
you
dream
tell
me
instead
of
replying
she
clasped
him
close
kissed
him
again
he
seized
her
wrists
disengaged
himself
from
her
grasp
tried
to
look
in
her
face
tell
me
what
did
you
dream
horrid
what
kind
of
dream
she
resisted
his
persistence
he
on
his
part
grew
more
uneasy
as
his
desire
to
know
became
greater
tell
me
shaken
with
another
shudder
she
stammered
i
i
drew
aside
the
i
she
smothered
this
last
word
in
kisses
invincible
i
chosen
by
a
friend
and
hired
at
ancona
sent
to
san
vito
transported
not
without
difficulty
to
the
hermitage
the
piano
was
received
by
hippolyte
with
childish
joy
it
was
placed
in
the
room
that
george
called
the
library
the
largest
and
best
decorated
that
in
which
were
the
divan
laden
with
cushions
the
long
cane
chairs
the
hammock
the
mats
the
rugs
all
the
objects
conducive
to
indolence
and
dreams
there
arrived
also
from
rome
a
box
of
music
thereafter
for
many
days
there
was
new
ecstasy
invaded
both
of
them
by
a
fever
they
did
nothing
forgot
everything
lost
themselves
entirely
in
this
new
pleasure
they
were
no
longer
embarrassed
by
the
monotony
of
the
long
afternoons
they
no
longer
felt
the
heavy
irresistible
drowsiness
they
could
lengthen
their
vigils
almost
until
daybreak
they
could
prolong
their
fasts
without
suffering
by
doing
so
without
noticing
it
as
if
their
corporeal
life
had
been
refined
as
if
they
were
sublimated
dispossessed
of
all
vulgar
needs
it
seemed
to
them
that
their
passion
ascended
chimerically
beyond
all
limit
that
the
palpitation
of
their
hearts
attained
a
prodigious
power
sometimes
it
seemed
to
them
that
once
more
they
had
found
that
moment
of
supreme
oblivion
that
moment
unique
that
they
had
enjoyed
when
their
lips
first
met
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
had
recovered
that
indefinable
and
confused
sensation
of
being
dispersed
into
space
with
the
lightness
of
vapor
sometimes
it
seemed
to
both
that
the
spot
that
they
had
chosen
was
indefinably
distant
from
other
places
very
distant
very
isolated
inaccessible
outside
of
the
world
a
mysterious
power
drew
them
together
joined
them
blended
them
melted
them
one
in
the
other
similarized
them
in
body
and
spirit
united
them
into
one
single
being
a
mysterious
power
separated
them
disjoined
them
forced
them
back
into
their
solitude
dug
an
abyss
between
them
planted
in
the
core
of
their
being
a
hopeless
and
mortal
desire
in
these
alternatives
both
found
pleasure
and
suffering
they
reascended
to
the
first
ecstasy
of
their
love
and
they
redescended
to
extreme
and
useless
efforts
to
repossess
each
other
they
reascended
again
remounted
to
the
origin
of
the
earthly
illusion
inhaled
the
mystic
shadow
where
for
the
first
time
their
trembling
souls
had
exchanged
the
same
silent
sentiment
and
they
redescended
again
redescended
to
the
torture
of
unrealized
expectation
entered
into
an
atmosphere
of
fog
thick
and
suffocating
like
a
whirlwind
of
sparks
and
hot
cinders
each
of
those
musicians
whom
they
loved
weaved
a
different
charm
about
their
supersensitive
feelings
a
page
of
robert
schumann
evoked
the
phantom
of
a
very
old
amour
that
extended
over
him
in
the
guise
of
an
artificial
firmament
the
woof
of
his
most
beautiful
recollections
which
with
an
astonished
and
melancholy
gentleness
he
saw
fade
gradually
away
an
of
frederic
chopin
was
saying
as
if
in
a
dream
at
night
when
you
are
sleeping
on
my
heart
i
hear
in
the
silence
of
the
night
a
drop
falling
slowly
falling
always
falling
so
near
so
far
i
hear
at
night
the
drop
falling
from
my
heart
the
blood
that
drop
by
drop
falls
from
my
heart
when
you
are
sleeping
when
you
are
sleeping
i
alone
high
purple
curtains
dark
as
a
merciless
passion
around
a
bed
deep
as
a
is
what
is
evoked
by
the
of
edward
grieg
and
also
a
promise
of
death
in
silent
voluptuousness
and
a
boundless
kingdom
rich
in
all
the
wealth
of
the
earth
waiting
in
vain
for
its
vanished
king
its
dying
king
in
the
nuptial
and
funereal
purple
but
in
the
prelude
to
tristan
and
ysolde
the
leap
of
love
toward
death
was
unchained
with
inconceivable
violence
the
insatiable
desire
was
exalted
even
to
the
intoxication
of
destruction
to
drink
yonder
the
cup
of
eternal
love
in
thy
honor
i
would
on
the
same
altar
consecrate
thee
to
death
with
myself
and
that
immense
wave
of
harmony
irresistibly
enveloped
them
both
closed
in
on
them
carried
them
away
transported
them
to
the
marvellous
empire
it
was
not
by
means
of
the
miserable
instrument
incapable
of
giving
the
slightest
echo
of
that
torrential
plenitude
but
in
the
eloquence
in
the
enthusiasm
of
the
exegesis
that
hippolyte
seized
all
the
grandeur
of
that
tragic
revelation
and
as
the
lover
s
imagery
had
one
day
pictured
to
her
the
guelph
s
deserted
city
the
city
of
convents
and
monasteries
so
appeared
to
her
imagination
the
old
gray
city
town
of
bayreuth
solitary
among
the
bavarian
mountains
in
a
mystic
landscape
over
which
hovered
the
same
soul
that
albrecht
dürer
imprisoned
beneath
the
network
of
the
lines
at
the
bottom
of
his
engravings
and
canvases
george
had
not
forgotten
any
episode
of
his
first
religious
pilgrimage
to
the
ideal
theatre
he
could
relive
every
instant
of
his
extraordinary
emotion
when
he
had
discovered
on
the
gentle
hill
at
the
extremity
of
the
great
shady
avenue
the
edifice
consecrated
to
the
supreme
feast
of
art
he
could
reconstitute
the
solemnity
of
the
vast
amphitheatre
girt
with
columns
and
arcades
the
mystery
of
the
mystic
gulf
in
the
religious
shadow
and
silence
of
the
place
in
the
shadow
and
ecstatic
silence
of
every
soul
a
sigh
went
up
from
the
invisible
orchestra
a
moan
was
uttered
a
murmuring
voice
made
the
first
mournful
call
of
solitary
desire
the
first
and
confused
anguish
in
presentiment
of
the
future
torture
and
that
sigh
and
that
moan
and
that
voice
mounted
from
the
vague
suffering
to
the
acuteness
of
an
impetuous
cry
telling
of
the
pride
of
a
dream
the
anxiety
of
a
superhuman
aspiration
the
terrible
and
implacable
desire
of
possession
with
a
devouring
fury
like
a
flame
bursting
from
a
bottomless
abyss
the
desire
dilated
agitated
enflamed
always
higher
always
higher
fed
by
the
purest
essence
of
a
double
life
the
intoxication
of
the
melodious
flame
embraced
everything
everything
sovereign
in
the
world
vibrated
passionately
in
the
immense
ravishment
exhaled
its
joy
and
most
hidden
sorrow
while
it
was
sublimated
and
consumed
but
suddenly
the
efforts
of
a
resistance
the
cholers
of
a
battle
shuddered
and
rumbled
in
the
flight
of
that
stormy
ascension
and
that
great
spout
of
life
suddenly
broken
against
an
invisible
obstacle
fell
back
again
died
out
spouted
forth
no
longer
in
the
religious
shadow
and
silence
of
the
place
in
the
shadow
and
thrilling
silence
of
every
soul
a
sigh
arose
from
the
mystic
gulf
a
moan
died
away
a
broken
voice
told
of
the
sadness
of
eternal
solitude
the
aspiration
toward
the
eternal
night
toward
the
divine
the
primal
oblivion
and
here
another
voice
a
human
voice
modulated
by
human
lips
young
and
strong
mingled
with
melancholy
irony
and
menace
sang
a
song
of
the
sea
from
the
head
of
a
mast
on
the
ship
that
carried
to
king
mark
the
blond
irish
spouse
it
sang
toward
the
occident
wanders
the
gaze
toward
the
orient
sails
the
ship
the
breeze
blows
fresh
toward
the
natal
land
o
daughter
of
ireland
where
dost
thou
linger
is
it
thy
sighs
that
swell
my
sail
blow
blow
o
wind
woe
ah
woe
daughter
of
ireland
my
wild
love
it
was
the
admonition
of
the
lookout
the
prophetic
warning
joyous
and
menacing
full
of
caress
and
of
raillery
indefinable
and
the
orchestra
became
silent
blow
blow
o
wind
woe
ah
woe
daughter
of
ireland
my
wild
love
the
voice
sang
over
the
tranquil
sea
alone
in
the
silence
while
under
the
tent
ysolde
motionless
on
her
couch
seemed
plunged
in
the
obscure
dream
of
her
destiny
thus
opened
the
drama
the
tragic
breath
that
had
already
been
given
by
the
prelude
passed
and
repassed
in
the
orchestra
suddenly
the
power
of
destruction
was
manifested
in
the
enchantress
against
the
man
of
her
choice
whom
she
had
devoted
to
death
her
anger
was
unchained
with
the
energy
of
the
blind
elements
she
invoked
all
the
terrible
forces
of
earth
and
heaven
to
destroy
the
man
whom
she
could
not
possess
awake
at
my
call
indomitable
power
come
forth
from
the
heart
where
thou
art
hidden
o
uncertain
winds
hear
my
will
awake
the
lethargy
of
this
dreamy
sea
resuscitate
from
the
depths
implacable
covetousness
show
it
the
prey
which
i
offer

the
wreckage
everything
that
palpitates
and
breathes
o
winds
i
give
to
thee
in
recompense
to
the
admonition
of
the
lookout
responded
the
sentiment
of
brangane
o
woe
what
ruin
i
foresee
ysolde
and
the
gentle
and
devoted
woman
tried
to
appease
that
mad
fury
oh
tell
me
thy
sorrow
ysolde
tell
me
thy
secret
and
ysolde
replied
my
heart
is
choking
open
open
wide
the
curtain
tristan
appeared
upright
motionless
his
arms
crossed
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
distances
of
the
sea
from
the
masthead
the
lookout
resumed
his
song
on
the
wave
mounting
from
the
orchestra
woe
ah
and
while
ysolde
s
eyes
lit
up
by
a
sombre
flame
contemplated
the
hero
the
fatal
motif
arose
from
the
mystic
gulf
the
great
and
terrible
symbol
of
love
and
death
in
which
was
enclosed
every
essence
of
the
tragic
fiction
and
with
her
own
mouth
ysolde
predicted
the
end
chosen
of
mine
lost
by
me
passion
aroused
in
her
a
homicidal
mania
awakened
in
the
roots
of
her
being
a
hostile
instinct
to
existence
a
need
of
dissolution
of
annihilation
she
raged
to
find
in
herself
and
all
about
her
a
crushing
power
that
would
strike
and
destroy
without
leaving
a
trace
her
hate
became
fiercer
at
the
sight
of
the
calm
and
motionless
hero
who
felt
the
menace
concentrate
upon
his
head
and
who
knew
the
uselessness
of
any
resistance
her
mouth
was
filled
with
bitter
sarcasm
what
thinkest
thou
of
that
slave
she
demanded
of
brangane
with
an
uneasy
smile
of
a
hero
she
made
a
slave
she
declared
herself
the
conqueror
tell
him
that
i
ysolde
command
my
vassal
to
fear
his
sovereign
such
was
the
defiance
she
cast
at
him
for
a
supreme
struggle
such
was
the
gauntlet
that
force
threw
down
to
force
a
sombre
solemnity
accompanied
the
hero
s
march
toward
the
threshold
of
the
tent
when
the
irrevocable
hour
had
sounded
when
the
philter
had
already
filled
the
cup
when
destiny
had
already
closed
its
circle
around
the
two
lives
ysolde
leaning
on
her
couch
pale
as
if
the
great
fever
had
consumed
all
the
blood
in
her
veins
waited
silently
tristan
appeared
on
the
threshold
both
erect
to
their
full
height
but
the
orchestra
told
of
the
inexpressible
anxiety
of
their
souls
from
this
moment
recommenced
the
tempestuous
ascension
it
seemed
that
the
mystic
gulf
had
once
more
become
inflamed
like
a
furnace
and
shot
higher
even
higher
its
sonorous
flames
only
comfort
for
an
eternal
mourning
salutary
draught
of
oblivion
i
drink
thee
without
fear
and
tristan
placed
the
cup
to
his
lips
half
for
me
i
drink
it
for
thee
cried
ysolde
snatching
the
cup
from
his
hands
the
golden
cup
fell
empty
had
they
both
drunk
death
must
they
die
instant
of
superhuman
agony
the
philter
of
death
was
but
a
poison
of
love
that
filled
them
with
an
immortal
fire
at
first
astonished
motionless
they
looked
at
each
other
sought
in
one
another
s
eyes
the
symptom
of
the
death
to
which
they
believed
they
had
devoted
themselves
but
a
new
life
incomparably
more
intense
than
that
they
had
lived
agitated
their
very
fibre
beat
at
their
temples
and
at
their
wrists
swelled
their
hearts
with
an
immense
wave
tristan
isolde
they
called
one
another
they
were
alone
nothing
breathed
about
them
appearances
were
effaced
the
past
was
wiped
out
the
future
was
a
dark
night
that
even
their
recent
intoxication
could
not
pierce
they
lived
they
called
one
another
in
hot
passionate
tones
each
was
drawn
to
the
other
by
a
fatality
that
henceforth
no
power
could
arrest
tristan
ysolde
and
the
melody
of
the
passion
spread
out
enlarged
exalted
itself
throbbed
and
sobbed
cried
and
chanted
above
the
profound
tempest
of
harmonies
that
became
more
and
more
agitated
mournful
and
joyous
it
took
an
irresistible
flight
toward
the
heights
of
unknown
ecstasies
toward
the
heights
of
the
supreme
voluptuousness
delivered
from
the
world
i
possess
thee
at
last
o
thou
who
alone
fill
my
soul
supreme
voluptuousness
of
love
hail
hail
to
mark
hail
cried
the
crew
amid
the
blasts
of
the
trumpets
saluting
the
king
who
drew
away
from
the
shore
to
go
to
meet
his
blond
spouse
hail
to
cornwall
it
was
the
tumult
of
common
life
the
clamor
of
profane
joy
the
dazzling
splendor
of
the
day
the
elect
the
lost
with
a
look
in
which
floated
the
sombre
shadow
of
a
dream
demanded
who
comes
hither
the
king
what
king
ysolde
pale
and
convulsed
beneath
the
royal
mantle
asked
where
am
i
do
i
still
live
must
i
still
live
gentle
and
terrible
the
motif
of
the
philter
ascended
enveloped
them
enclosed
them
in
its
ardent
spiral
the
trumpets
sounded
hail
to
mark
hail
to
cornwall
glory
to
the
king
but
in
the
second
prelude
all
the
sobs
of
too
strong
a
joy
all
the
pantings
of
exasperated
desire
all
the
starts
of
furious
expectation
alternated
mingled
were
confounded
the
impatience
of
the
feminine
soul
communicated
its
thrills
to
the
immensity
of
the
night
to
all
the
things
that
in
the
pure
summer
night
breathed
and
watched
the
ravished
soul
threw
its
appeals
to
everything
that
they
might
remain
vigilant
beneath
the
stars
that
they
might
be
present
at
the
festival
of
its
love
at
the
nuptial
banquet
of
its
joy
insubmergible
over
the
restless
ocean
of
harmony
the
fatal
melody
floated
growing
light
clouding
the
wave
from
the
mystic
gulf
like
the
respiration
of
a
superhuman
bosom
swelled
rose
fell
back
to
rise
again
to
fall
again
and
slowly
die
away
dost
thou
hear
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sound
has
died
away
in
the
distance
ysolde
heard
nothing
more
but
the
sounds
imagined
by
her
desire
the
horns
of
the
nocturnal
chase
resounded
in
the
forest
distinct
coming
nearer
it
is
the
deceptive
whispering
of
the
leaves
that
the
wind
rustles
in
its
sport
that
gentle
sound
is
not
that
of
horns
it
is
the
murmur
of
the
mountain
stream
that
gushes
forth
and
falls
in
the
silent
night
she
heard
nothing
but
the
enchanting
sounds
born
in
her
soul
by
the
desire
left
there
by
the
old
yet
ever
new
charm
in
the
orchestra
as
in
her
abused
senses
the
resonances
of
the
chase
were
magically
transformed
dissolving
into
the
infinite
murmurs
of
the
forest
into
the
mysterious
eloquence
of
the
summer
night
all
those
smothered
voices
all
the
subtle
seductions
enveloped
the
panting
woman
and
suggested
to
her
the
approaching
ravishment
while
brangane
warned
and
begged
in
vain
in
the
terror
of
his
presentiment
oh
let
the
protecting
torch
blaze
let
its
light
show
thee
the
peril
nothing
had
the
power
of
enlightening
the
blindness
of
desire
were
this
the
torch
of
my
life
i
would
extinguish
it
without
fear
and
i
extinguish
it
without
fear
with
a
gesture
of
supreme
disdain
intrepid
and
superb
ysolde
threw
the
torch
to
the
ground
she
offered
her
life
and
that
of
the
elect
to
the
fatal
night
she
entered
with
him
into
the
shadow
forever
then
the
most
intoxicating
poem
of
human
passion
was
triumphantly
unfolded
like
a
spiral
to
the
summits
of
delirium
and
ecstasy
it
was
the
first
frantic
embrace
the
mingling
of
voluptuousness
and
of
anguish
in
which
the
souls
eager
to
melt
into
one
another
encountered
the
impenetrable
obstacle
of
the
body
it
was
the
first
rancor
against
the
time
when
love
did
not
exist
against
the
empty
and
useless
past
it
was
the
hate
against
hostile
light
against
the
perfidious
day
that
sharpened
all
their
sufferings
that
revived
all
the
fallacious
appearances
that
favored
pride
and
oppressed
tenderness
it
was
the
hymn
to
the
friendly
night
to
the
beneficent
shade
to
the
divine
mystery
of
which
the
marvels
and
inner
visions
were
unveiled
in
which
were
heard
the
distant
voices
of
the
spheres
in
which
the
ideal
corollas
flourished
on
inflexible
stems
since
the
sun
is
hidden
in
our
bosom
the
stars
of
happiness
shed
their
laughing
light
and
in
the
orchestra
spoke
every
eloquence
sang
every
joy
wept
every
misery
that
the
human
voice
had
ever
expressed
the
melodies
emerged
from
the
symphonic
depths
developing
interrupting
superposing
mingling
melting
into
one
another
dissolving
disappearing
to
again
appear
a
more
and
more
restless
and
poignant
anxiety
passed
over
all
the
instruments
and
expressed
a
continual
and
effort
to
attain
the
inaccessible
in
the
impetuosity
of
the
chromatic
progressions
there
was
the
mad
pursuit
of
a
happiness
that
eluded
every
grasp
although
it
shone
ever
so
near
in
the
changings
of
the
tone
rhythm
and
measure
in
the
succession
of
syncopes
there
was
a
truceless
search
there
was
a
limitless
covetousness
there
was
the
long
torture
of
desire
ever
deceived
and
ever
extinguished
a
motif
a
symbol
of
eternal
desire
eternally
exasperated
by
a
deceptive
possession
returned
every
instant
with
a
cruel
persistence
it
enlarged
it
dominated
now
illuminating
the
crests
of
the
harmonic
waves
now
obscuring
them
with
funereal
darkness
the
frightful
power
of
the
philter
operated
on
the
soul
and
on
the
flesh
of
the
two
lovers
already
consecrated
to
death
nothing
could
extinguish
or
soften
that
fatal
ardor
nothing
except
death
they
had
vainly
tried
every
caress
they
had
vainly
summoned
all
their
strength
to
unite
in
a
supreme
embrace
to
finally
possess
one
another
to
become
one
and
the
same
being
their
sighs
of
voluptuousness
were
transformed
into
agonizing
sobs
an
infrangible
obstacle
was
interposed
between
them
separated
them
rendered
them
strangers
and
solitary
the
obstacle
was
their
corporeal
substance
their
living
personality
and
a
secret
hate
was
born
in
both
a
longing
to
destroy
themselves
to
annihilate
themselves
a
desire
to
cause
death
and
a
desire
to
die
even
in
the
caress
they
recognized
the
impossibility
of
crossing
the
material
limits
of
their
human
senses
lips
met
lips
and
stopped
why
not
succumb
to
death
said
tristan
rather
than
separation
and
what
prevents
tristan
from
loving
ysolde
forever
living
hereafter
eternally
for
her
alone
and
already
they
entered
into
the
infinite
darkness
the
outside
world
disappeared
so
said
tristan
so
should
we
die
unwilling
to
live
but
for
love
inseparable
forever
united
without
end
without
awakening
without
fear
without
name
in
the
bosom
of
love
the
words
were
distinctly
heard
in
the
of
the
orchestra
a
new
ecstasy
ravished
the
two
lovers
and
carried
them
to
the
threshold
of
the
marvellous
nocturnal
empire
already
they
tasted
in
advance
the
beatitude
of
dissolution
felt
themselves
delivered
from
the
weight
of
the
body
felt
their
substance
sublimated
and
float
diffused
in
an
endless
joy
without
end
without
awakening
without
fear
without
name
take
care
take
care
behold
the
night
giving
way
to
the
day
warned
from
above
the
invisible
brangane
take
care
and
the
shudder
of
the
matinal
frost
traversed
the
park
awoke
the
flowers
the
cold
light
of
the
dawn
ascended
slowly
and
covered
up
the
stars
that
palpitated
more
strongly
take
care
vain
warning
of
the
faithful
watcher
they
were
not
listening
they
would
not
could
not
awaken
themselves
under
the
menace
of
the
day
they
plunged
still
further
on
into
that
darkness
from
which
could
never
come
the
slightest
glint
of
twilight
let
the
night
eternally
envelop
us
and
a
whirlwind
of
harmonies
enveloped
them
clasped
them
close
in
its
vehement
spirals
transformed
them
to
the
distant
shore
invoked
by
their
desire
there
where
no
anguish
oppressed
the
flights
of
the
loving
soul
beyond
all
languor
beyond
all
pain
beyond
all
solitude
in
the
infinite
serenity
of
their
supreme
dream
save
thyself
tristan
it
was
the
cry
of
kurvenal
after
the
cry
of
brangane
it
was
the
unexpected
and
brutal
assault
that
interrupted
the
ecstatic
embrace
and
while
the
theme
of
love
persisted
in
the
orchestra
the
motif
of
the
hunt
burst
out
with
a
metallic
clash
the
king
and
his
courtiers
appeared
tristan
hid
ysolde
stretched
on
the
bed
of
flowers
beneath
his
ample
mantle
he
hid
her
from
both
gaze
and
light
affirming
by
this
act
his
domination
signifying
his
undoubted
right
the
sad
the
last
time
for
the
last
time
in
the
calm
and
resolute
attitude
of
a
hero
he
accepted
the
battle
with
the
unknown
forces
sure
henceforth
that
nothing
could
modify
or
suspend
the
course
of
his
destiny
while
the
sovereign
sorrow
of
king
mark
was
exhaled
in
a
slow
and
deep
melopee
he
remained
silent
immovable
in
his
secret
thought
and
finally
he
responded
to
the
king
s
questions
never
can
i
reveal
that
mystery
never
can
you
know
what
thou
dost
ask
the
philter
motif
condensed
in
this
response
the
obscurity
of
the
mystery
the
gravity
of
the
irreparable
event
dost
thou
wish
to
follow
tristan
o
ysolde
he
demanded
of
the
queen
simply
in
the
presence
of
all
in
the
land
where
i
am
going
the
sun
does
not
shine
it
is
the
land
of
shadows
it
is
the
land
of
night
from
which
my
mother
sent
me
when
conceived
by
her
in
death
in
death
i
came
to
life
and
ysolde
there
where
the
country
of
tristan
is
there
would
ysolde
go
she
wants
to
follow
him
gentle
and
faithful
in
the
path
that
he
will
point
out
and
the
dying
hero
preceded
her
to
that
land
struck
by
the
traitor
melot
meanwhile
the
third
prelude
evoked
the
vision
of
the
distant
shore
the
arid
and
desolate
rocks
where
in
the
secret
caves
the
sea
seemed
to
weep
ceaselessly
in
inconsolable
mourning
a
mist
of
legend
and
of
mysterious
poesy
enveloped
the
rigid
forms
of
the
rock
perceived
as
in
an
uncertain
dawn
or
in
an
almost
extinguished
twilight
and
the
sound
of
the
pastoral
pipe
awoke
the
confused
images
of
the
past
life
of
the
things
lost
in
the
night
of
time
what
says
the
ancient
lament
sighed
tristan
where
am
i
on
the
fragile
reed
the
shepherd
modulated
the
imperishable
melody
transmitted
by
our
ancestors
through
the
ages
and
in
his
profound
unconsciousness
he
was
without
inquietude
and
tristan
to
whose
soul
these
humble
notes
had
revealed
all
i
did
not
linger
in
the
place
of
my
awakening
but
where
have
i
dwelt
i
could
not
say
there
i
saw
neither
the
sun
nor
the
land
nor
the
inhabitants
but
what
i
saw
then
i
could
not
say
it
was
there
where
i
always
was
there
where
i
will
go
forever
in
the
vast
empire
of
the
universal
night
yonder
a
single
and
unique
science
is
given
us
the
divine
the
eternal
the
original
oblivion
the
delirium
of
fever
agitated
him
the
ardor
of
the
philter
corroded
his
inmost
fibres
oh
what
i
suffer
thou
canst
not
suffer
the
terrible
desire
which
devours
me
that
implacable
fire
which
consumes
me
ah
if
i
could
tell
thee
if
thou
couldst
understand
me
and
the
unconscious
shepherd
breathed
breathed
into
his
reed
it
was
the
same
air
the
notes
were
always
the
same
they
spoke
of
the
life
that
was
no
more
they
spoke
of
distant
and
annihilated
things
old
and
grave
melody
said
tristan
your
lamenting
sounds
reached
me
even
on
the
evening
wind
as
when
in
distant
times
the
death
of
the
father
was
announced
to
the
son
in
the
sinister
dawn
thou
didst
seek
me
more
and
more
uneasy
when
the
son
learned
of
the
departure
of
the
mother
when
my
father
engendered
me
and
died
when
my
mother
brought
me
to
light
and
died
the
old
melody
came
to
their
ears
also
languishing
and
sad
she
interrogated
me
one
day
and
now
she
is
speaking
to
me
again
to
what
destiny
was
i
born
to
what
destiny
the
old
melody
is
repeating
it
to
me
to
desire
and
to
die
to
die
of
desire
oh
no
no
such
is
not
your
true
sense
to
desire
to
desire
to
desire
even
unto
death
but
not
to
die
of
desire
stronger
and
stronger
more
and
more
tenacious
the
philter
corroded
him
to
the
marrow
all
his
being
writhed
in
the
unbearable
spasm
at
moments
the
orchestra
had
the
crepitations
of
a
funereal
pyre
the
violence
of
the
pain
traversed
him
at
times
with
tempestuous
impetuosity
reviving
the
flames
sudden
starts
shook
him
atrocious
cries
escaped
from
it
choking
sobs
were
extinguished
in
it
the
philter
the
philter
the
terrible
philter
with
what
fury
i
feel
it
mount
from
my
heart
to
my
brain
henceforth
no
remedy
no
sweet
death
can
deliver
me
from
the
torture
of
desire
in
no
place
in
no
spot
alas
shall
i
find
repose
the
night
repulses
me
toward
the
day
and
the
eye
of
the
sun
feeds
on
my
perpetual
suffering
ah
how
the
ardent
sun
burns
me
and
consumes
me
and
not
even
to
have
never
to
have
the
refreshment
of
a
shade
for
that
devouring
ardor
what
balm
would
procure
a
relief
to
my
horrible
torture
he
bore
in
his
veins
and
marrow
the
desire
of
all
men
of
every
species
amassed
generation
after
generation
aggravated
by
the
faults
of
all
the
fathers
and
of
all
the
sons
the
intoxications
of
all
the
anguishes
of
all
in
his
blood
blossomed
the
germs
of
the
secular
concupiscence
remingled
the
most
diverse
impurities
refermented
the
venoms
the
most
subtle
and
violent
that
since
immemorial
ages
the
purplish
sinuous
mouths
of
women
had
poured
out
on
eager
and
subjugated
males
he
was
the
heir
of
the
eternal
evil
that
terrible
philter
which
condemns
me
to
torture
it
is
i
i
myself
who
have
compounded
it
with
the
agitations
of
my
father
with
the
convulsions
of
my
mother
with
all
the
tears
of
love
shed
in
other
times
with
laughter
and
with
tears
with
pleasures
and
with
wounds
i
myself
have
compounded
the
poison
of
that
philter
and
i
have
drunk
it
by
deep
enjoyable
draughts
a
curse
on
thee
terrible
philter
a
curse
on
he
who
compounded
thee
and
he
fell
back
on
his
couch
exhausted
inanimate
to
recover
his
equanimity
to
feel
once
more
the
ardor
of
his
wound
to
see
once
more
with
his
hallucinated
eyes
the
sovereign
image
crossing
the
fields
of
the
sea
she
is
coming
she
is
coming
towards
land
softly
rocked
on
the
great
waves
of
intoxicating
flowers
her
smile
throws
on
me
a
divine
consolation
she
brings
me
the
supreme
refreshment
thus
he
invoked
thus
with
his
eyes
closed
henceforth
to
the
common
light
the
sorceress
the
mistress
of
balms
the
healer
of
all
wounds
she
comes
she
comes
dost
thou
not
see
her
kurvenal
dost
thou
not
see
her
and
the
agitated
waves
of
the
mystic
gulf
gathered
confusedly
from
the
depths
all
the
melodies
already
heard
mingling
them
raising
them
up
submerging
them
in
an
abyss
repulsing
them
again
to
the
surface
crushing
them
those
that
could
have
expressed
the
anguish
of
the
decisive
conflict
on
the
bridge
of
the
ship
those
in
which
one
heard
the
boiling
of
the
draught
poured
into
the
golden
cup
and
the
buzzing
in
the
arteries
invaded
by
the
liquid
fire
those
in
which
had
been
heard
the
mysterious
breath
of
the
summer
night
inviting
voluptuousness
without
end
all
the
melodies
with
all
the
images
and
all
the
recollections
and
on
this
immense
shipwreck
the
fatal
melody
passed
proud
sovereign
implacable
repeating
at
intervals
the
atrocious
condemnation
to
desire
to
desire
to
desire
even
unto
death
but
not
to
die
of
desire
the
vessel
drops
its
anchor
ysolde
behold
ysolde
she
springs
to
the
shore
cried
kurvenal
from
the
top
of
the
tower
and
in
the
delirium
of
joy
tristan
tore
off
the
bandages
of
his
wound
excited
his
own
blood
to
flow
to
inundate
the
earth
to
empurple
the
world
at
the
approach
of
ysolde
and
death
he
believed
he
the
light
do
i
not
hear
the
light
do
not
my
ears
hear
the
light
a
great
inner
sun
dazzled
him
every
atom
of
his
substance
darted
rays
of
sunlight
that
in
luminous
waves
expanded
through
the
universe
the
light
was
music
the
music
was
light
and
then
the
mystic
gulf
truly
became
irradiated
like
a
sky
the
sonorities
of
the
orchestra
seemed
to
imitate
those
distant
planetary
harmonies
that
long
ago
the
souls
of
vigilant
contemplators
believed
they
surprised
in
the
nocturnal
silence
gradually
the
long
tremblings
of
restlessness
the
long
bursts
of
anguish
the
pantings
of
vain
pursuits
and
the
efforts
of
the
desire
and
all
the
agitations
of
terrestrial
misery
were
appeased
became
dissipated
tristan
had
finally
crossed
the
limit
of
the
marvellous
empire
he
had
finally
entered
into
eternal
night
and
ysolde
bent
over
the
inert
shell
felt
at
last
the
heavy
weight
that
still
crushed
her
slowly
dissolve
the
fatal
melody
become
clearer
and
more
solemn
consecrated
the
great
funereal
hymn
then
the
notes
like
ethereal
chords
began
to
weave
about
the
lover
veils
of
diaphanous
purity
thus
commenced
a
sort
of
joyous
assumption
by
degrees
of
splendor
on
the
wing
of
a
hymn
what
a
sweet
smile
he
is
smiling
dost
thou
not
see
dost
thou
not
hear
am
i
alone
to
hear
that
new
melody
infinitely
sweet
and
consoling
that
streams
from
the
depths
of
his
being
and
ravishes
me
and
penetrates
me
and
envelops
me
the
irish
sorceress
the
formidable
mistress
of
philters
the
hereditary
arbitrator
of
obscure
terrestrial
powers
she
who
from
the
tops
of
the
ship
had
invoked
the
whirlwinds
and
tempests
she
whose
love
had
chosen
the
strongest
and
most
noble
of
heroes
to
intoxicate
and
destroy
him
she
who
had
closed
the
path
of
glory
and
victory
to
a
conqueror
of
the
world
the
poisoner
the
homicide
became
transfigured
by
the
power
of
death
into
a
being
of
light
and
of
joy
exempt
from
all
impure
covetousness
free
from
all
base
attachment
throbbing
and
respiring
in
the
breast
of
the
diffused
soul
of
the
universe
are
not
these
clearer
sounds
that
murmur
in
my
ear
the
soft
waves
of
the
air
must
i
respire
drink
plunge
myself
slowly
drift
in
the
vapors
and
perfumes
all
in
her
dissolved
melted
dilated
returned
to
the
original
fluidity
to
the
immense
elementary
ocean
in
which
the
forms
were
born
in
which
the
forms
disappeared
to
become
renewed
and
to
be
reborn
in
the
mystic
gulf
the
transformations
and
transfigurations
were
being
accomplished
note
by
note
harmony
by
harmony
without
interruption
it
seemed
as
if
all
things
there
were
decomposed
exhaling
their
hidden
essences
changing
into
immaterial
symbols
colors
never
before
seen
on
petals
of
the
most
delicate
terrestrial
flowers
perfumes
of
an
almost
imperceptible
subtlety
floated
there
visions
of
secret
paradises
were
revealed
in
a
flash
of
light
the
germs
of
worlds
to
be
born
blossomed
there
and
the
panicky
intoxication
ascended
ascended
the
chorus
of
the
great
all
covered
the
unique
human
voice
transfigured
ysolde
entered
into
the
marvellous
empire
triumphantly
to
lose
oneself
to
throw
oneself
into
the
abyss
to
swoon
without
consciousness
in
the
infinite
throbbing
of
the
universal
soul
supreme
voluptuousness
ii
for
two
entire
days
the
two
hermits
lived
thus
amid
great
fiction
respired
that
burning
atmosphere
saturated
themselves
with
that
mortal
forgetfulness
they
believed
they
had
transfigured
themselves
that
they
had
attained
superior
heights
of
existence
in
the
vertiginous
heights
of
their
they
believed
they
equalled
the
personages
in
the
drama
did
it
not
seem
to
them
that
they
too
had
drunk
a
philter
were
not
they
also
tormented
by
a
limitless
desire
were
they
not
also
linked
together
by
an
indissoluble
bond
and
did
they
not
often
feel
in
voluptuousness
the
horrors
of
the
did
they
not
hear
the
rumbling
of
death
george
like
tristan
when
he
heard
the
ancient
melody
modulated
by
the
shepherd
found
in
that
music
the
direct
revelation
of
an
anguish
in
which
he
believed
he
had
at
last
surprised
the
true
essence
of
his
soul
and
the
tragic
secret
of
his
destiny
no
man
could
better
penetrate
the
symbolic
and
mythical
sense
of
the
philter
and
no
man
better
than
himself
could
better
measure
the
depth
of
the
inner
drama
solely
inner
in
which
the
pensive
hero
had
consumed
his
strength
nor
could
any
one
better
understand
the
despairing
cry
of
the
victim
that
terrible
philter
which
has
condemned
me
to
torture
is
i
i
myself
who
compounded
he
then
undertook
the
funereal
seduction
of
his
mistress
he
wished
to
slowly
persuade
her
to
die
he
wished
to
entice
her
to
go
with
him
toward
a
mysterious
and
comfortable
end
during
that
beautiful
adriatic
summer
full
of
transparencies
and
perfumes
the
great
phrase
of
spread
out
in
such
a
wide
circle
of
light
around
the
transfiguration
of
also
enclosed
hippolyte
in
its
charm
she
repeated
it
ceaselessly
in
a
low
tone
sometimes
even
in
a
loud
voice
with
signs
of
exuberant
joy
wouldn
t
you
like
to
die
such
a
death
as
ysolde
s
asked
george
with
a
smile
i
would
she
answered
but
on
earth
people
don
t
die
like
that
and
if
i
died
he
went
on
always
smiling
suppose
you
saw
me
dead
fact
not
in
i
believe
i
should
die
too
but
of
despair
and
suppose
i
proposed
to
you
to
die
with
me
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
manner
for
a
few
seconds
she
remained
thoughtful
her
eyes
cast
down
then
raising
toward
the
tempter
a
look
full
of
all
the
sweetness
of
life
why
die
she
said
if
i
love
you
if
you
love
me
if
nothing
henceforth
prevents
us
from
living
for
ourselves
alone
is
life
sweet
to
you
he
murmured
with
veiled
bitterness
yes
she
answered
with
a
sort
of
vehemence
life
is
sweet
to
me
because
i
love
you
and
if
i
should
die
he
went
on
without
a
smile
because
once
more
he
felt
arise
in
him
the
instinctive
hostility
against
this
beautiful
sensual
creature
who
breathed
in
the
very
air
as
if
it
were
happiness
you
won
t
die
she
affirmed
with
the
same
assurance
you
are
young
why
should
you
die
in
her
voice
in
her
attitude
in
all
her
person
there
was
an
unusual
diffusion
of
happiness
her
appearance
was
such
as
living
creatures
have
only
at
the
time
their
lives
flow
harmoniously
in
a
temporary
equilibrium
of
all
the
energies
in
accord
with
favorable
external
conditions
as
at
other
times
she
seemed
to
blossom
in
the
strong
sea
air
in
the
coolness
of
the
summer
evening
and
she
recalled
one
of
those
magnificent
twilight
flowers
that
open
the
crown
of
their
petals
at
sunset
after
a
long
pause
during
which
one
heard
the
murmur
of
the
sea
on
the
shore
like
the
rustling
of
dry
leaves
george
asked
do
you
believe
in
destiny
yes
i
do
ill
disposed
to
the
sad
gravity
toward
which
george
s
words
seemed
to
tend
she
had
answered
in
a
light
jesting
tone
hurt
he
retorted
quickly
and
bitterly
do
you
know
what
day
this
is
perplexed
uneasy
she
asked
what
day
is
it
he
hesitated
up
to
then
he
had
avoided
recalling
to
the
forgetful
woman
the
anniversary
of
demetrius
s
death
a
repugnance
that
grew
every
minute
prevented
him
from
uttering
that
holy
name
from
evoking
outside
of
the
sanctuary
that
noble
image
he
felt
that
he
would
have
profaned
his
religious
sorrow
in
admitting
hippolyte
as
a
participant
and
what
further
intensified
this
feeling
was
that
he
was
then
passing
through
one
of
those
frequent
periods
of
cruel
lucidity
in
which
he
saw
in
hippolyte
only
the
woman
of
pleasure
the
flower
of
concupiscence
the
enemy
he
contained
himself
and
with
a
sudden
and
false
laugh
look
he
cried
there
is
a
festival
at
ortona
he
pointed
in
the
distance
to
the
maritime
city
that
was
being
crowned
with
fire
how
strange
you
are
she
said
then
looking
steadily
at
him
with
that
singular
expression
which
she
was
in
the
habit
of
assuming
when
she
wished
to
appease
and
soften
him
she
added
come
here
come
and
sit
by
my
side
he
was
standing
in
the
shadow
on
the
threshold
of
one
of
the
doors
that
opened
on
the
loggia
she
was
seated
outside
on
the
parapet
clothed
in
a
light
white
robe
in
a
languorous
pose
her
bust
outlined
against
the
background
of
the
sea
where
still
lingered
the
glints
of
twilight
and
the
profile
of
her
brown
head
was
outlined
in
a
zone
of
limpid
amber
he
seemed
as
if
reborn
as
if
he
had
stepped
out
from
a
close
and
suffocating
place
from
an
atmosphere
heavy
with
poisonous
exhalations
in
george
s
eyes
she
seemed
as
if
she
were
evaporating
like
a
vial
of
perfumes
were
losing
the
ideal
life
accumulated
in
her
by
the
power
of
music
were
gradually
emptying
herself
of
importunate
dreams
were
returning
to
primitive
animalism
george
thought
as
always
she
has
done
nothing
but
receive
and
obediently
retain
the
attitudes
i
have
given
her
the
inner
life
has
always
been
and
will
always
be
factitious
in
her
directly
my
suggestion
is
interrupted
she
returns
to
her
own
nature
she
becomes
a
woman
again
an
instrument
of
low
lasciviousness
nothing
will
ever
change
her
substance
nothing
will
purify
her
she
has
plebeian
blood
and
in
her
blood
god
knows
what
ignoble
heredities
but
i
too
shall
never
be
able
to
free
myself
from
the
desire
with
which
she
fires
me
i
can
never
extirpate
it
from
my
flesh
henceforth
i
can
neither
live
with
her
nor
without
her
i
know
i
must
die
but
shall
i
leave
her
for
a
successor
his
hate
against
the
unconscious
creature
had
never
been
aroused
with
so
much
violence
he
dissected
her
pitilessly
with
acrimony
that
astonished
even
himself
it
was
as
if
he
were
avenging
some
infidelity
some
disloyalty
that
had
surpassed
all
the
limits
of
perfidy
he
felt
the
envious
rancor
of
the
shipwrecked
sailor
who
at
the
moment
of
sinking
sees
near
him
his
comrade
about
to
save
himself
to
cling
to
life
again
for
him
that
anniversary
brought
a
new
confirmation
of
the
decree
which
he
already
knew
was
irrevocable
for
him
that
day
was
the
epiphany
of
death
he
felt
that
he
was
no
longer
master
of
himself
he
felt
the
absolute
domination
of
the
fixed
idea
that
from
instant
to
instant
might
suggest
the
supreme
act
to
him
and
at
the
same
time
communicate
the
effective
impulsion
to
his
will
and
while
criminal
images
confusedly
passed
through
his
brain
must
i
die
alone
he
repeated
to
himself
must
i
die
alone
he
shuddered
when
hippolyte
touched
his
face
and
passed
her
arm
around
his
neck
did
i
frighten
you
she
asked
on
seeing
him
disappear
in
the
still
deepening
shadow
of
the
door
a
singular
restlessness
had
seized
her
and
she
had
risen
to
embrace
him
of
what
are
you
thinking
what
s
the
matter
why
are
you
like
that
she
spoke
in
an
insinuating
tone
and
still
with
her
arms
about
him
she
caressed
his
head
in
the
obscurity
he
saw
the
mysterious
pallor
of
that
face
the
light
of
those
eyes
an
irresistible
trembling
seized
him
you
are
trembling
what
ails
you
what
s
the
matter
she
disengaged
herself
found
a
candle
on
the
table
and
lit
it
she
went
up
to
him
anxious
took
both
his
hands
are
you
ill
yes
he
stammered
i
don
t
feel
well
this
is
one
of
my
bad
days
this
was
not
the
first
time
she
heard
him
complain
of
vague
physical
suffering
of
heavy
and
wandering
pains
of
painful
twitchings
and
tinglings
of
vertigos
and
nightmares
she
believed
these
sufferings
imaginary
she
saw
in
them
the
effects
of
habitual
melancholy
the
excesses
of
thought
and
she
knew
no
better
remedy
for
them
than
kisses
laughter
and
joyousness
where
are
you
suffering
i
could
not
say
oh
i
know
what
it
is
the
music
excites
you
too
much
we
must
have
no
more
for
a
week
no
we
will
have
no
more
no
more
she
went
to
the
piano
shut
the
cover
over
the
keys
locked
it
and
hid
the
little
key
we
will
resume
our
long
walks
we
will
spend
all
morning
on
the
beach
shall
we
and
now
come
into
the
loggia
she
drew
him
toward
her
with
a
tender
gesture
see
how
beautiful
the
evening
is
smell
how
the
rocks
embalm
the
air
she
breathed
in
the
briny
odor
trembling
and
clasping
him
close
we
have
everything
to
make
us
happy
and
you
will
regret
these
days
when
they
are
gone
time
flies
it
will
be
soon
three
months
that
we
are
here
do
you
already
think
of
leaving
me
he
asked
uneasy
suspicious
she
wanted
to
reassure
him
no
no
she
replied
not
yet
but
the
prolongation
of
my
absence
becomes
difficult
on
account
of
my
mother
i
received
only
a
letter
recalling
me
you
know
she
needs
me
when
i
am
not
at
home
all
goes
wrong
then
you
must
soon
return
to
rome
no
i
shall
have
to
find
another
pretext
you
know
that
my
mother
believes
i
am
here
in
company
with
an
old
girl
friend
of
mine
my
sister
has
helped
me
and
still
helps
me
in
rendering
this
fiction
probable
and
besides
my
mother
knows
that
i
need
and
that
last
year
i
was
ill
from
not
having
taken
them
do
you
remember
i
spent
the
summer
at
caronno
at
my
sister
s
what
a
horrible
summer
well
what
to
do
i
can
certainly
remain
with
you
this
whole
month
of
august
perhaps
also
the
first
week
of
september
and
after
that
after
that
you
will
permit
me
to
return
to
rome
and
you
will
come
and
rejoin
me
there
there
we
will
arrange
concerning
the
future
i
have
already
an
idea
in
my
head
what
i
will
tell
you
but
just
now
let
us
dine
aren
t
you
hungry
the
dinner
was
ready
as
usual
in
the
loggia
the
table
was
spread
in
the
open
air
they
lit
the
large
lamp
look
she
cried
when
the
domestic
had
brought
to
the
table
the
steaming
soup
tureen
that
is
candia
s
work
she
had
asked
candia
to
make
a
rustic
soup
for
him
after
the
manner
of
the
savory
mixture
rich
in
ginger
colored
and
odorous
she
had
already
tasted
it
several
times
attracted
by
its
odor
in
the
houses
of
the
old
people
and
she
had
become
greedy
for
it
it
is
delicious
you
will
enjoy
it
and
she
filled
a
bowl
full
with
a
gesture
of
childish
greediness
and
she
swallowed
the
first
spoonful
hastily
i
have
never
tasted
anything
more
delicious
she
called
candia
to
praise
her
work
candia
candia
the
woman
showed
herself
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
laughing
does
the
soup
please
you
signora
it
is
perfect
may
it
change
into
good
blood
for
you
and
the
naïve
laughter
of
the
enceinte
woman
arose
in
the
still
air
george
took
part
in
this
gayety
and
showed
it
the
sudden
change
in
his
humor
was
evident
he
poured
out
some
wine
and
drank
it
at
a
gulp
he
made
an
effort
to
conquer
his
repugnance
to
eat
that
repugnance
which
latterly
had
become
so
serious
that
at
times
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
underdone
meat
you
feel
better
don
t
you
asked
hippolyte
leaning
toward
him
and
moving
her
chair
a
little
to
get
a
little
closer
to
him
yes
i
feel
bettor
now
he
drank
again
look
she
cried
look
at
ortona
in
holiday
attire
both
looked
towards
the
distant
city
crowned
with
fire
on
the
hill
that
stretched
along
by
the
shadowy
sea
groups
of
fire
balloons
like
constellations
of
flame
were
rising
slowly
in
the
still
air
they
seemed
to
multiply
ceaselessly
they
peopled
all
that
part
of
the
sky
my
sister
is
at
ortona
now
she
s
staying
with
the
vallereggia
relatives
of
ours
has
she
written
to
you
yes
how
happy
i
should
be
to
see
her
she
resembles
you
doesn
t
she
christine
is
your
favorite
for
a
few
seconds
she
remained
pensive
then
she
went
on
how
happy
i
should
be
to
see
your
mother
i
have
so
often
thought
of
her
and
after
another
pause
in
a
tender
voice
how
she
must
adore
you
an
unexpected
emotion
swelled
george
s
heart
and
before
him
reappeared
the
interior
vision
of
the
house
he
had
abandoned
forgotten
and
for
a
moment
all
the
past
sorrows
came
back
to
his
mind
together
with
all
the
painful
pictures
his
mother
s
emaciated
face
her
eyelids
swollen
and
reddened
by
tears
the
sweet
and
remembrance
of
christine
the
sickly
child
whose
large
head
was
always
bent
on
a
breast
barren
of
all
but
sighs
the
cadaveric
mask
of
the
poor
idiotic
gormand
and
the
tired
eyes
of
his
mother
asked
him
again
as
when
they
separated
are
you
abandoning
me
again
his
soul
stretched
out
toward
the
distant
house
suddenly
inclining
before
it
like
a
tree
before
a
squall
and
the
secret
in
the
obscurity
of
the
chamber
between
hippolyte
s
beneath
the
shock
of
an
obscure
warning
when
he
saw
again
in
memory
the
closed
door
behind
which
was
demetrius
s
bed
when
he
saw
again
the
mortuary
chapel
at
the
corner
of
the
cemetery
in
the
bluish
and
solemn
shadow
of
the
protecting
mountain
but
hippolyte
was
speaking
becoming
loquacious
as
at
other
times
she
imprudently
abandoned
herself
to
her
domestic
reminiscences
and
he
as
at
other
times
began
to
listen
observing
with
uneasiness
certain
vulgar
lines
that
the
mouth
of
this
woman
fell
into
during
the
abundance
and
heat
of
the
discourse
observing
as
he
had
done
so
often
before
the
particular
gesture
that
was
habitual
to
her
when
she
was
excited
that
ungraceful
gesture
that
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
her
she
was
saying
you
saw
my
mother
one
day
in
the
street
do
you
remember
what
a
difference
between
my
mother
and
my
father
my
father
was
always
good
and
affectionate
to
us
incapable
of
beating
us
or
severely
scolding
us
my
mother
is
violent
impetuous
almost
cruel
ah
if
i
told
you
of
the
martyrdom
of
my
sister
poor
adriana
she
always
rebelled
and
her
rebellion
exasperated
my
mother
who
used
to
beat
her
until
the
blood
came
i
knew
enough
to
disarm
her
by
recognizing
my
fault
and
asking
her
pardon
for
all
that
with
all
her
severity
she
had
an
immense
love
for
us
our
apartment
had
a
window
that
led
out
on
a
cistern
and
we
in
play
often
used
to
stand
at
this
window
and
draw
up
the
water
with
a
little
pail
one
day
my
mother
went
out
and
by
chance
we
were
left
alone
a
few
minutes
after
we
were
surprised
to
see
her
come
in
again
all
in
tears
agitated
upset
she
took
me
in
her
arms
and
covered
me
with
kisses
sobbing
as
if
insane
in
the
street
she
had
had
a
presentiment
that
i
had
fallen
from
that
window
george
saw
again
in
memory
the
face
of
that
hysterical
old
woman
in
which
was
exaggerated
all
the
defects
of
her
daughter
s
face
the
development
of
the
lower
jaw
the
length
of
the
chin
the
width
of
the
nostrils
he
saw
again
that
forehead
like
that
of
a
fury
over
which
bristled
the
gray
hair
thick
and
dry
and
those
dark
eyes
beneath
the
superciliary
ridge
that
revealed
the
fanatic
ardor
of
a
bigot
and
the
obstinate
avarice
of
an
insignificant
bourgeoise
you
see
that
scar
beneath
my
chin
went
on
hippolyte
my
mother
did
that
my
sister
and
i
went
to
school
and
we
had
very
nice
dresses
that
we
had
to
take
off
on
our
return
one
evening
on
going
home
i
found
on
the
table
a
that
i
took
to
rewarm
my
frozen
hands
my
mother
said
to
me
go
and
undress
i
replied
i
m
going
and
i
continued
to
warm
myself
she
repeated
go
and
undress
i
repeated
i
m
she
had
in
her
hand
a
large
brush
and
was
brushing
a
dress
i
lingered
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
my
mother
repeated
for
the
third
time
go
and
undress
and
i
repeated
i
m
furious
she
threw
the
brush
at
me
it
struck
and
broke
the
a
splinter
of
the
handle
struck
me
here
beneath
the
chin
and
cut
a
vein
the
blood
flowed
my
aunt
ran
to
me
quickly
but
my
mother
neither
moved
nor
looked
at
me
the
blood
flowed
by
good
fortune
they
soon
found
a
surgeon
who
ligated
the
vein
my
mother
remained
obstinately
silent
when
my
father
came
home
and
saw
me
bandaged
he
asked
what
was
the
matter
my
mother
without
a
word
looked
at
me
fixedly
i
replied
i
fell
down
the
my
mother
said
nothing
as
a
consequence
i
have
suffered
considerably
from
that
loss
of
blood
but
how
adriana
was
beaten
on
account
of
giulio
my
i
shall
never
forget
a
terrible
scene
she
stopped
perhaps
she
had
just
noticed
on
george
s
face
some
equivocal
sign
i
bore
you
don
t
i
with
all
this
gossip
no
no
continue
please
don
t
you
see
i
am
listening
we
lived
then
in
ripetta
in
the
house
of
a
family
of
the
name
of
angelini
with
whom
we
became
very
friendly
luigi
sergi
the
brother
of
my
giulio
occupied
the
lower
floor
with
his
wife
eugenia
luigi
was
a
man
studious
modest
eugenia
was
a
woman
of
the
worst
kind
although
her
husband
made
a
good
deal
of
money
she
was
always
running
him
into
debt
and
no
one
knew
in
what
manner
she
spent
all
the
money
gossip
had
it
that
it
went
to
pay
her
lovers
she
was
very
homely
so
the
story
was
generally
believed
my
sister
had
become
attached
to
eugenia
i
do
not
know
how
and
she
was
forever
going
downstairs
on
the
pretext
of
taking
lessons
in
french
from
luigi
that
displeased
my
mother
rendered
suspicious
by
angelina
s
sisters
old
maids
who
pretended
to
have
friendship
for
the
sergis
but
who
in
reality
deserted
them
like
and
were
happy
to
be
able
to
slander
them
allowing
adriana
to
visit
the
house
of
an
abandoned
woman
hard
words
increased
but
eugenia
always
favored
giulio
s
and
adriana
s
amours
giulio
often
came
to
rome
from
milan
on
business
and
one
day
just
as
he
was
coming
my
sister
made
great
haste
to
go
downstairs
my
mother
forbade
her
to
move
my
sister
insisted
in
the
dispute
my
mother
raised
her
hand
they
seized
each
other
by
the
hair
my
sister
went
so
far
as
to
bite
her
arms
and
escaped
by
the
staircase
but
as
she
knocked
at
the
sergi
door
my
mother
fell
on
her
and
in
the
open
landing
place
there
was
such
a
scene
of
violence
as
i
shall
never
forget
adriana
was
brought
back
home
almost
dead
she
fell
ill
and
had
convulsions
my
mother
repentant
surrounded
her
with
care
became
more
gentle
than
she
ever
was
before
a
few
days
later
even
before
she
was
entirely
cured
adriana
eloped
with
giulio
but
that
i
believe
i
have
already
told
you
and
after
all
this
innocent
gossip
in
which
she
forgot
herself
without
suspecting
the
effect
produced
on
her
lover
by
her
commonplace
recollections
she
again
took
to
her
interrupted
supper
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
then
she
added
smiling
you
see
what
a
terrible
woman
my
mother
is
you
don
t
know
and
you
can
never
know
how
much
she
has
tortured
me
when
the
struggle
broke
out
against
him
my
god
what
torture
she
remained
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
george
fixed
upon
the
imprudent
woman
a
look
charged
with
hate
and
jealousy
suffering
in
that
moment
all
his
sufferings
of
the
past
two
years
with
the
fragments
with
which
she
had
had
the
imprudence
to
furnish
him
he
reconstructed
hippolyte
s
life
in
her
own
circle
not
without
attributing
to
it
the
meanest
vulgarities
not
without
lowering
it
to
the
most
dishonorable
contacts
if
the
marriage
of
the
sister
took
place
under
the
auspices
of
a
nymphomaniac
under
what
conditions
as
a
consequence
of
what
circumstances
was
that
of
hippolyte
concluded
then
in
what
world
had
her
early
years
been
passed
by
what
intrigues
had
she
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
odious
man
whose
name
she
bore
and
he
represented
to
himself
the
hidden
and
sordid
life
in
certain
little
homes
of
old
that
exhaled
at
the
same
time
a
stench
of
cooking
and
the
musty
smell
of
a
sacristy
that
fermented
with
the
double
corruption
of
the
family
and
the
church
the
prediction
of
alphonso
exili
returned
to
his
memory
do
you
know
who
your
probable
successor
is
it
is
monti
the
di
monti
has
money
it
appeared
probable
to
him
that
hippolyte
would
end
in
that
way
by
lucrative
amours
and
that
she
would
have
the
tacit
consent
of
her
people
gradually
allured
by
an
easier
existence
disembarrassed
of
domestic
cares
surrounded
once
more
by
comforts
far
greater
than
those
which
the
matrimonial
state
of
their
daughter
had
procured
for
them
could
not
i
myself
make
an
offer
like
that
propose
that
frankly
to
hippolyte
she
said
the
other
day
that
she
had
something
in
view
for
the
winter
for
the
future
very
well
could
we
not
arrange
it
i
am
sure
that
after
having
seriously
considered
the
offer
and
the
stability
of
the
position
that
sour
old
woman
would
not
have
much
repugnance
in
accepting
me
as
a
substitute
for
the
fugitive
perhaps
we
should
even
end
by
all
becoming
a
happy
family
for
the
end
of
our
days
the
sarcasm
wrenched
his
heart
with
intolerable
cruelty
nervously
he
poured
out
some
more
wine
and
drank
why
are
you
drinking
so
much
this
evening
asked
hippolyte
looking
into
his
eyes
i
am
thirsty
you
are
not
drinking
are
you
hippolyte
s
glass
was
empty
drink
said
george
making
a
gesture
as
if
about
to
fill
her
glass
no
she
answered
i
prefer
water
as
usual
no
wine
pleases
me
except
champagne
do
you
remember
at
albano
the
astonishment
of
that
good
pancrace
when
the
cork
would
not
pop
and
he
had
to
use
a
corkscrew
there
must
be
still
several
bottles
below
in
the
case
i
will
go
and
find
them
and
george
rose
quickly
no
no
not
this
evening
she
wanted
to
retain
him
but
as
he
was
preparing
to
descend
i
will
go
too
she
said
gayly
lightly
she
descended
with
him
into
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
that
served
as
a
candia
hastened
to
them
with
a
lamp
they
searched
at
the
bottom
of
the
case
and
recovered
two
bottles
with
silvered
necks
the
last
here
they
are
exclaimed
hippolyte
already
excited
sensually
here
they
are
two
more
she
lifted
them
up
brilliant
toward
the
lamp
let
us
go
she
ran
out
laughing
ascended
the
stairs
placed
the
bottles
on
the
table
for
a
few
seconds
she
sat
as
if
bewildered
panting
somewhat
then
she
shook
her
head
look
at
ortona
she
stretched
out
her
hand
toward
the
distant
town
beautiful
in
its
gala
dress
and
which
seemed
to
be
wafting
its
joy
as
far
as
where
she
sat
a
crimson
glare
was
spread
over
the
top
of
the
hill
as
over
an
active
crater
and
from
the
lighted
area
kept
rising
innumerable
balloons
in
the
deep
azure
drifting
in
vast
circles
presenting
a
picture
of
an
immense
illuminated
dome
reflected
by
the
sea
on
the
table
rich
in
flowers
fruits
and
sweetmeats
the
were
whirling
the
froth
from
the
generous
wine
splashed
over
the
rush
mats
i
drink
to
our
happiness
she
said
lifting
her
glass
toward
her
lover
i
drink
to
our
peace
he
said
holding
out
his
own
the
glasses
clashed
together
so
roughly
that
both
were
broken
the
golden
wine
was
spilled
on
the
table
inundated
a
pile
of
fine
succulent
peaches
a
good
omen
a
good
omen
cried
hippolyte
more
merry
at
this
sprinkling
than
if
she
had
drunk
deeply
and
she
placed
her
hand
on
the
wet
fruit
piled
before
her
they
were
magnificent
peaches
of
a
deep
crimson
on
one
side
as
if
the
rising
sun
had
painted
them
on
seeing
them
hanging
ripe
on
the
branch
that
strange
dew
seemed
to
revivify
them
what
a
marvel
she
said
taking
the
most
luxurious
one
without
removing
the
skin
she
bit
it
greedily
the
juice
ran
from
the
corners
of
her
mouth
yellow
as
liquid
honey
you
bite
now
she
held
the
streaming
peach
out
to
her
lover
with
the
same
gesture
she
had
offered
him
the
rest
of
the
bread
beneath
the
oak
in
the
twilight
of
the
first
day
that
recollection
awoke
in
george
s
memory
and
he
felt
a
desire
to
speak
of
it
do
you
remember
he
said
do
you
remember
the
first
evening
when
you
bit
the
bread
fresh
from
the
oven
and
you
gave
it
me
all
warm
and
humid
do
you
remember
how
good
it
seemed
to
me
i
remember
everything
can
i
forget
the
slightest
incident
of
that
day
she
saw
again
in
imagination
the
path
all
strewn
with
furze
the
fresh
and
delicate
homage
shed
on
her
path
for
a
few
moments
she
remained
silent
absorbed
by
that
vision
of
poesy
the
furze
she
murmured
with
an
unexpected
smile
of
regret
then
she
added
do
you
remember
the
entire
hill
was
clothed
in
yellow
and
the
perfume
gave
one
vertigo
drink
said
george
pouring
the
sparkling
wine
into
the
new
glasses
i
drink
to
the
coming
springtime
of
our
love
said
hippolyte
and
she
drank
to
the
last
drop
george
immediately
refilled
her
empty
glass
she
put
her
fingers
into
a
box
of
asking
will
you
have
amber
or
pink
they
were
oriental
confections
sent
to
them
by
adolpho
sort
of
elastic
paste
colored
amber
and
pink
and
powdered
with
pistache
and
so
perfumed
that
they
gave
to
the
mouth
the
illusion
of
a
fleshy
flower
rich
in
honey
who
knows
where
the
don
juan
is
now
said
george
on
receiving
the
sweetmeat
from
hippolyte
s
fingers
white
with
sugar
and
over
his
soul
passed
the
nostalgia
of
the
distant
isles
the
isles
embalmed
by
the
mastic
and
which
at
the
very
moment
perhaps
were
sending
all
their
nocturnal
delights
on
the
breeze
to
swell
the
great
sail
hippolyte
detected
the
note
of
regret
in
george
s
words
so
you
prefer
to
be
on
board
away
over
there
with
your
friend
rather
than
here
alone
with
me
she
said
neither
here
nor
there
somewhere
else
he
replied
smiling
in
a
bantering
tone
and
he
rose
to
offer
his
lips
to
his
companion
she
gave
him
a
long
kiss
with
her
mouth
all
sticky
and
covered
with
the
sugar
of
the
still
unswallowed
while
the
moths
whirled
round
about
them
you
do
not
drink
he
said
after
the
kiss
his
voice
slightly
changed
she
emptied
the
glass
at
a
draught
it
is
almost
warm
said
she
as
she
laid
it
down
do
you
remember
the
iced
champagne
at
danieli
s
in
venice
oh
how
i
love
to
see
it
flow
slowly
slowly
in
thick
flakes
when
she
spoke
of
the
things
that
pleased
her
or
of
the
caresses
that
she
preferred
she
had
in
her
voice
a
singular
delicacy
to
modulate
the
syllables
her
lips
moved
in
a
manner
that
expressed
profound
sensuality
now
in
every
one
of
these
words
in
each
of
these
movements
george
found
a
motif
of
the
keenest
suffering
that
sensuality
which
he
had
himself
aroused
in
her
he
believed
had
now
come
to
the
point
where
desire
untiring
and
tyrannical
could
no
longer
support
any
bridle
and
claimed
immediate
satisfaction
hippolyte
appeared
to
him
like
a
woman
irresistibly
addicted
to
pleasure
in
all
its
forms
no
matter
what
degradation
it
might
cost
her
when
he
had
gone
away
or
when
she
had
tired
of
his
love
she
would
accept
the
most
generous
and
most
practical
offer
perhaps
she
would
even
succeed
in
raising
the
price
very
high
where
in
fact
could
a
rarer
instrument
of
voluptuousness
be
found
she
possessed
at
present
every
seduction
and
every
science
she
had
that
beauty
which
strikes
men
at
sight
which
disturbs
them
which
awakens
in
their
blood
implacable
covetousness
she
had
feline
elegance
of
person
refined
taste
in
dress
exquisite
art
in
colors
and
styles
that
harmonized
with
her
grace
she
had
learned
to
modulate
in
a
voice
suave
and
warm
as
the
velvet
of
her
eyes
the
slow
syllables
that
evoked
dreams
and
lulled
pain
she
bore
in
the
depths
of
her
being
a
secret
malady
that
seemed
at
times
to
mysteriously
illumine
her
sensibility
she
had
by
turns
the
languors
of
the
malady
and
the
vehemence
of
health
and
finally
she
was
barren
united
in
her
then
were
the
sovereign
virtues
that
destine
a
woman
to
dominate
the
world
by
the
scourge
of
her
impure
beauty
passion
had
refined
and
complicated
these
virtues
she
was
now
at
the
zenith
of
her
power
if
all
at
once
she
found
herself
free
and
untrammelled
what
road
would
she
choose
in
life
george
had
no
longer
the
slightest
doubt
he
knew
what
that
choice
would
be
he
was
confirmed
in
the
certitude
that
his
influence
over
her
was
bounded
by
the
senses
and
by
certain
factitious
attitudes
of
her
mind
the
plebeian
foundation
had
persisted
impenetrable
in
its
thickness
he
was
convinced
that
this
plebeian
foundation
would
permit
her
to
adapt
herself
without
compunction
to
the
contact
of
a
lover
who
would
not
be
distinguished
by
any
superior
qualities
physical
or
moral
in
short
a
commonplace
lover
and
while
he
filled
her
empty
glass
again
with
the
wine
she
preferred
the
wine
that
one
uses
to
enliven
secret
suppers
to
animate
little
modern
orgies
behind
closed
doors
he
attributed
in
imagination
attitudes
of
outrageous
immodesty
to
the
pale
and
voracious
roman
incomparable
in
the
art
of
tiring
the
loins
of
men
how
your
hand
trembles
observed
hippolyte
looking
at
it
it
s
true
he
said
with
a
convulsion
that
simulated
gayety
i
think
i
ve
already
had
too
much
why
don
t
you
drink
that
s
not
fair
she
laughed
and
drank
for
the
third
time
filled
with
a
childish
joy
at
the
thought
of
getting
tipsy
at
feeling
her
intelligence
become
gradually
obscured
the
fumes
of
the
wine
were
already
operating
in
her
the
hysterical
demon
began
to
move
her
see
how
sunburnt
my
arms
are
she
cried
drawing
her
large
sleeves
up
to
the
elbows
just
look
at
my
wrists
although
she
was
a
carnation
brunette
of
a
warm
color
the
skin
at
her
wrists
was
extremely
transparent
and
of
a
strange
pallor
the
sun
had
burnt
the
parts
exposed
but
on
the
under
side
the
wrists
had
remained
pale
and
on
that
fine
skin
through
that
pallor
the
veins
shone
through
subtle
and
yet
very
visible
of
an
intense
azure
slightly
approaching
a
violet
george
had
often
repeated
the
words
of
cleopatra
to
the
messenger
from
italy
here
are
my
bluest
veins
to
kiss
hippolyte
held
out
her
wrists
to
him
and
said
kiss
them
he
seized
one
and
made
a
motion
with
his
knife
as
if
about
to
cut
it
off
she
dared
him
to
cut
if
you
want
to
i
won
t
move
during
the
gesture
he
looked
fixedly
at
the
delicate
blue
network
on
her
skin
so
clearly
defined
that
it
seemed
to
belong
to
another
body
to
the
body
of
a
blond
woman
and
that
singularity
attracted
him
tempted
him
æsthetically
by
the
suggestion
of
a
tragic
image
of
beauty
it
is
your
vulnerable
spot
he
said
with
a
smile
it
is
a
sure
indication
you
will
die
from
cut
veins
give
me
the
other
hand
he
placed
the
two
wrists
together
and
again
made
a
gesture
as
to
cut
them
off
with
a
single
blow
the
complete
image
arose
in
his
imagination
on
the
marble
threshold
of
a
door
full
of
shadow
and
expectation
the
woman
who
was
about
to
die
appeared
extending
her
naked
arms
and
at
the
extremities
of
the
arms
from
the
slashed
veins
spouted
and
palpitated
two
red
fountains
and
between
these
red
fountains
the
face
slowly
assumed
a
supernatural
pallor
the
cavities
of
the
eyes
were
filled
with
an
infinite
mystery
the
phantom
of
an
inexpressible
word
was
outlined
on
the
closed
mouth
all
at
once
the
double
jet
ceased
to
flow
the
exsanguined
body
fell
backwards
like
a
mass
in
the
shadow
tell
me
your
dream
begged
hippolyte
seeing
him
absorbed
he
described
the
image
to
her
very
beautiful
said
she
with
admiration
as
if
before
an
engraving
and
she
lit
a
cigarette
she
puffed
a
wave
of
smoke
from
between
her
lips
against
the
lamp
around
which
the
were
whirling
she
watched
for
a
moment
the
agitation
of
the
little
variegated
wings
between
the
moving
veils
of
the
cloud
then
she
turned
toward
ortona
which
scintillated
with
fire
she
arose
and
raised
her
eyes
to
the
stars
how
warm
the
night
is
she
said
breathing
heavily
aren
t
you
warm
too
she
threw
away
her
cigarette
again
she
uncovered
her
arms
she
came
close
to
him
she
suddenly
threw
his
head
back
she
enveloped
him
in
a
long
caress
her
mouth
glided
over
all
his
face
languishing
and
ardent
in
a
multiple
kiss
she
clung
to
him
entwined
him
and
with
an
almost
inexplicable
movement
agile
and
furtive
she
seated
herself
on
his
knees
intoxicating
him
with
the
perfume
of
her
skin
that
perfume
at
once
irritating
and
delicious
that
always
had
the
same
exhilarating
effect
on
him
as
the
scent
of
the
tuberose
every
fibre
of
his
being
trembled
like
a
few
moments
before
when
she
had
clasped
him
ardently
in
the
room
filled
with
the
last
shadows
of
twilight
she
noticed
his
emotion
and
it
aroused
desire
in
her
her
hands
became
bold
no
no
let
me
be
he
stammered
repulsing
her
we
shall
be
seen
she
tore
herself
away
she
tottered
slightly
and
appeared
really
influenced
by
the
wine
it
seemed
as
though
a
mist
passing
over
her
eyes
and
into
her
brain
obscured
her
sight
and
thought
she
put
her
hands
to
her
forehead
and
burning
cheeks
how
warm
it
is
she
sighed
i
wish
i
had
nothing
on
possessed
from
now
on
by
that
one
fixed
idea
george
repeated
to
himself
must
i
die
alone
as
the
fatal
hour
drew
nearer
the
deed
of
violence
seemed
more
necessary
behind
him
in
the
shadow
in
the
bedroom
he
heard
the
ticktack
of
the
clock
he
heard
the
rhythmic
blows
of
a
on
a
distant
field
these
two
sounds
cadenced
and
dissimilar
intensified
in
him
the
sensation
of
the
flight
of
time
gave
him
a
sort
of
anxious
terror
look
at
ortona
aflame
cried
hippolyte
what
a
number
of
rockets
the
festive
city
illuminated
the
sky
innumerable
parting
from
a
central
point
spread
out
in
the
sky
like
a
broad
golden
fan
that
slowly
from
top
to
bottom
dissolved
into
a
shower
of
scattered
sparks
and
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
golden
rain
a
new
fan
was
formed
entire
and
splendid
to
dissolve
again
and
reform
again
while
the
waters
reflected
the
changing
picture
one
heard
a
low
crepitation
like
a
distant
fusilade
interspersed
with
deeper
reports
that
followed
the
explosions
of
bombs
in
the
heights
of
the
sky
and
at
every
report
the
city
the
port
the
great
mole
appeared
in
a
different
light
fantastically
transfigured
upright
against
the
parapet
hippolyte
admired
the
spectacle
and
saluted
the
brighter
splendors
with
exclamations
of
delight
from
time
to
time
it
spread
over
her
person
like
the
reflection
of
a
fire
she
is
overexcited
a
little
inebriated
ready
for
any
madness
thought
george
as
he
watched
her
i
could
suggest
a
walk
which
she
has
often
wanted
to
take
to
go
through
one
of
the
tunnels
by
the
light
of
a
torch
i
would
go
down
to
the
trabocco
to
get
a
torch
she
could
wait
for
me
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
i
would
lead
her
then
to
the
tunnel
by
a
path
that
i
know
i
would
manage
that
the
train
should
come
upon
us
while
we
were
in
the
accident
the
idea
seemed
to
him
easy
of
realization
it
had
presented
itself
to
his
imagination
with
extraordinary
clearness
as
if
it
had
formed
an
integral
part
of
his
consciousness
since
that
first
day
when
before
the
shining
rails
he
received
the
first
confused
glimmer
from
them
she
must
die
too
his
resolution
became
strengthened
immutable
he
heard
behind
him
the
ticking
of
the
clock
he
felt
a
feeling
of
intense
anxiety
he
could
not
master
it
was
getting
late
perhaps
there
was
scarcely
time
for
them
to
go
down
he
must
act
without
delay
assure
himself
immediately
as
to
the
precise
time
indicated
by
the
clock
but
it
seemed
impossible
for
him
to
rise
from
his
chair
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
spoke
to
her
carelessly
his
speech
would
fail
him
he
started
to
his
feet
as
he
heard
in
the
distance
the
rumbling
too
late
and
his
heart
beat
so
fast
that
he
believed
he
would
die
of
anguish
as
he
heard
the
rumbling
and
whistling
draw
nearer
hippolyte
turned
the
train
she
said
come
and
see
he
went
and
she
encircled
his
neck
with
her
bare
arm
leaning
on
his
shoulder
it
is
entering
the
tunnel
she
said
again
prompted
by
the
difference
in
sound
in
george
s
ears
the
rumbling
increased
in
a
frightful
manner
he
saw
as
in
a
hallucination
his
mistress
and
himself
beneath
the
dark
roof
the
rapid
approach
of
the
headlight
in
the
dark
the
short
struggle
on
the
rails
the
simultaneous
fall
the
bodies
crushed
by
the
horrible
violence
and
at
the
same
time
he
felt
the
contact
of
the
supple
woman
caressing
always
triumphant
and
added
to
the
physical
horror
of
this
barbarous
destruction
he
felt
an
exasperated
rancor
against
her
who
seemed
to
escape
his
hate
both
leaning
against
the
parapet
they
watched
the
deafening
train
rapid
and
sinister
that
shook
the
house
to
its
very
foundations
and
even
imparted
the
shock
to
them
at
night
said
hippolyte
pressing
still
closer
to
him
i
m
afraid
when
the
train
shakes
the
house
as
it
passes
aren
t
you
too
i
have
often
felt
you
tremble
he
did
not
hear
her
an
immense
tumult
stirred
his
whole
being
it
was
the
rudest
and
most
obscure
agitation
that
his
soul
had
ever
experienced
incoherent
thoughts
and
images
whirled
in
his
brain
and
his
heart
writhed
beneath
a
thousand
cruel
punctures
but
one
fixed
image
dominated
all
the
others
invaded
the
centre
of
his
soul
what
was
he
doing
at
this
hour
five
years
before
he
was
holding
vigil
over
a
cadaver
he
was
contemplating
a
face
hidden
beneath
a
black
veil
a
long
pale
hippolyte
s
restless
hands
touched
him
crept
into
his
hair
tickled
his
neck
on
his
neck
on
his
ear
he
felt
a
warm
mouth
with
an
instinctive
motion
that
he
could
not
repress
he
drew
aside
walked
away
she
laughed
that
singular
laugh
ironical
and
immodest
which
burst
out
and
resounded
from
between
her
teeth
whenever
her
lover
refused
himself
to
her
and
under
this
obsession
he
heard
once
more
the
slow
and
limpid
syllables
for
fear
of
my
kisses
a
low
crepitation
mingled
with
the
distinct
reports
still
came
from
the
festive
town
the
fireworks
were
beginning
again
hippolyte
turned
toward
the
spectacle
look
one
would
think
that
ortona
were
on
fire
a
vast
crimson
glare
lit
up
the
heavens
and
was
reflected
in
the
waters
and
in
the
midst
of
the
light
the
profile
of
the
flaming
town
was
outlined
the
rockets
burst
overhead
like
splendid
large
roses
shall
i
live
through
this
night
shall
i
recommence
to
live
and
how
long
a
disgust
bitter
as
a
nausea
an
almost
savage
hate
arose
from
his
heart
at
the
thought
that
the
following
night
he
would
again
have
that
woman
near
him
on
the
same
pillow
that
he
would
again
hear
the
breathing
of
the
sleeping
woman
that
he
would
again
smell
the
odor
and
feel
the
contact
of
that
heated
skin
and
then
that
the
day
would
break
again
and
pass
by
in
the
usual
idleness
amidst
the
torture
of
perpetual
alternatives
a
burst
of
light
struck
him
attracted
his
gaze
to
the
spectacle
outside
a
vast
pink
lunary
light
blossomed
over
the
festive
town
and
yonder
on
the
shore
illuminated
the
succession
of
little
indented
bays
and
jutting
points
as
far
as
the
sight
could
reach
cape
moro
the
nicchiola
the
trabocco
the
rocks
near
or
distant
as
far
as
the
vasto
point
appeared
a
few
seconds
in
the
immense
irradiation
the
promontory
suggested
a
secret
voice
to
george
suddenly
while
his
gaze
was
carried
to
the
heights
crowned
by
the
twisted
the
white
light
faded
away
the
distant
town
became
silent
still
outlined
against
the
shadows
by
its
illuminations
in
the
silence
george
perceived
again
the
oscillations
of
the
pendulum
and
the
rhythmic
beats
of
the
flax
brake
but
now
he
was
master
of
his
anguish
he
felt
himself
stronger
and
his
mind
clearer
shall
we
go
out
a
little
he
asked
hippolyte
in
a
slightly
changed
voice
we
ll
go
to
some
spot
in
the
open
we
ll
stretch
ourselves
out
on
the
grass
and
breath
in
the
fresh
air
look
the
night
is
almost
as
light
as
if
it
were
full
moon
no
no
let
us
stay
here
she
answered
nonchalantly
it
s
not
late
are
you
sleepy
already
i
can
not
go
to
bed
too
early
you
know
i
do
not
sleep
i
suffer
i
would
gladly
take
a
little
walk
come
do
not
be
so
lazy
you
could
come
just
as
you
are
no
no
let
us
stay
here
and
once
more
she
passed
her
bare
arms
around
his
neck
languishing
seized
by
desire
let
us
stay
here
come
indoors
let
us
lie
down
a
little
come
she
tried
to
coax
him
to
entice
him
seized
by
desire
that
became
all
the
fiercer
as
she
noticed
george
s
resistance
she
was
all
ardor
and
her
beauty
was
at
its
best
illuminated
as
by
a
torch
her
long
serpentine
body
trembled
through
her
thin
wrapper
her
large
dark
eyes
shed
the
fascinating
charm
of
the
supreme
hours
of
passion
she
was
the
sovereign
sensualism
repeating
i
am
forever
the
unconquered
i
am
stronger
than
your
thought
the
odor
of
my
skin
has
the
power
to
dissolve
a
world
in
you
no
no
i
do
not
want
to
declared
george
seizing
her
wrists
with
an
almost
brutal
violence
that
he
could
not
moderate
ah
you
don
t
want
to
she
echoed
mockingly
amused
by
the
struggle
sure
of
conquering
incapable
of
giving
way
in
her
caprice
he
regretted
his
roughness
to
draw
her
into
the
snare
he
must
be
mild
and
coaxing
must
simulate
ardor
and
tenderness
after
that
he
would
certainly
induce
her
to
take
the
nocturnal
last
walk
but
on
the
other
hand
he
also
felt
the
absolute
necessity
of
not
losing
that
nervous
momentary
energy
that
was
indispensable
for
the
approaching
action
ah
so
you
don
t
want
to
she
repeated
throwing
her
bare
arms
about
him
gazing
up
at
him
looking
into
the
depths
of
his
eyes
with
a
species
of
repressed
frenzy
george
permitted
himself
to
be
led
into
the
room
then
all
the
enemy
s
feline
lasciviousness
broke
loose
over
him
whom
she
believed
already
vanquished
she
let
down
her
hair
loosened
her
dress
permitted
her
natural
perfume
to
be
exhaled
like
a
shrub
of
odoriferous
flowers
she
seemed
to
realize
that
she
must
disarm
this
man
that
she
must
enervate
him
and
that
she
must
crush
him
to
prevent
him
from
becoming
dangerous
george
felt
he
was
lost
once
more
the
enemy
had
asserted
her
superiority
suddenly
she
was
seized
with
laughter
nervous
frantic
ungovernable
lugubrious
as
the
laughter
of
the
insane
frightened
he
let
her
go
he
looked
at
her
with
manifest
horror
thinking
is
this
madness
she
laughed
laughed
laughed
writhing
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
biting
her
fingers
holding
her
sides
she
laughed
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
shaken
by
long
sonorous
hiccoughs
at
intervals
she
stopped
for
a
second
then
recommenced
with
renewed
violence
and
nothing
was
more
lugubrious
than
these
mad
laughs
in
the
silence
of
the
magnificent
night
don
t
be
afraid
don
t
be
afraid
she
said
during
the
pauses
at
the
sight
of
her
perplexed
and
frightened
lover
i
am
calmer
now
go
out
please
please
go
out
he
went
back
on
the
loggia
as
if
in
a
dream
nevertheless
his
brain
retained
a
strange
lucidity
and
strange
wakefulness
all
his
acts
all
his
perceptions
had
for
him
the
unreality
of
a
dream
and
assumed
at
the
same
time
a
signification
as
profound
as
that
of
an
allegory
he
still
heard
behind
him
the
laughter
he
retained
still
in
his
fingers
the
sensation
of
the
impure
thing
he
saw
above
and
around
him
the
beauty
of
the
summer
evening
he
knew
what
was
on
the
point
of
being
accomplished
the
laughs
ceased
again
in
the
silence
he
perceived
the
vibrations
of
the
pendulum
and
the
beats
of
the
flax
brake
on
the
distant
area
a
groan
coming
from
the
house
of
the
old
people
made
him
shudder
it
was
the
pain
of
her
who
was
now
in
childbirth
all
must
be
accomplished
he
thought
and
turning
he
crossed
the
threshold
with
a
firm
step
hippolyte
lay
upon
the
sofa
recomposed
pale
her
eyes
at
the
approach
of
her
lover
she
smiled
come
sit
down
she
murmured
with
a
vague
gesture
he
bent
over
her
and
saw
tears
between
her
eyelashes
are
you
suffering
he
asked
i
feel
a
slight
suffocation
i
have
a
weight
here
as
if
a
ball
were
rising
and
falling
she
pointed
to
the
centre
of
her
chest
he
said
it
is
suffocating
in
this
room
make
an
effort
and
get
up
let
us
go
out
the
air
will
do
you
good
come
he
rose
and
held
out
his
hands
she
gave
him
hers
and
let
him
raise
her
when
on
her
feet
she
shook
her
head
to
throw
back
her
hair
which
was
still
untied
then
she
bent
down
to
search
for
her
lost
hairpins
where
can
they
be
what
are
you
looking
for
my
hairpins
let
them
be
you
ll
find
them
but
i
need
them
to
fasten
my
hair
leave
your
hair
as
it
is
it
pleases
me
that
way
she
smiled
they
went
out
into
the
loggia
she
raised
her
face
towards
the
stars
and
breathed
the
perfume
of
the
summer
night
you
see
how
beautiful
the
night
is
said
george
in
a
hoarse
yet
gentle
voice
they
are
beating
the
flax
said
hippolyte
listening
attentively
to
the
continuous
rhythm
let
us
go
down
said
george
let
us
walk
a
little
let
us
go
as
far
as
the
yonder
he
seemed
to
hang
on
hippolyte
s
lips
no
no
let
us
remain
here
you
see
in
what
a
state
i
am
what
does
that
matter
who
will
see
you
we
shall
not
meet
a
living
soul
at
this
hour
come
as
you
are
i
d
go
without
my
hat
the
country
is
almost
like
a
garden
for
us
let
us
go
down
she
hesitated
a
few
seconds
but
she
too
felt
the
need
of
fresh
air
of
getting
away
from
this
house
that
still
seemed
to
resound
with
the
echo
of
her
horrible
laughs
let
us
go
down
she
finally
consented
at
these
words
george
felt
as
if
his
heart
had
ceased
to
beat
with
an
instinctive
movement
he
approached
the
threshold
of
the
illuminated
room
he
cast
toward
the
interior
a
look
of
anguish
a
look
of
farewell
a
hurricane
of
recollections
arose
in
his
distracted
soul
shall
we
leave
the
lamp
lit
he
asked
without
thinking
of
what
he
was
saying
and
his
own
voice
gave
him
an
indefinable
sensation
as
of
some
distant
and
strange
thing
yes
answered
hippolyte
they
went
down
on
the
staircase
they
took
each
other
by
the
hand
slowly
descending
step
by
step
george
made
so
violent
an
effort
to
repress
his
anguish
that
the
effort
caused
in
him
a
strange
exaltation
he
considered
the
immensity
of
the
nocturnal
sky
and
believed
it
to
be
filled
by
the
intensity
of
his
own
life
they
perceived
on
the
parapet
of
the
courtyard
the
shadow
of
a
man
motionless
and
silent
they
recognized
old
colas
you
here
at
this
hour
colas
said
hippolyte
are
you
not
sleepy
i
am
keeping
vigil
for
candia
who
is
in
childbirth
responded
the
old
man
and
is
everything
going
well
yes
very
well
the
door
of
the
habitation
was
lit
up
wait
a
minute
said
hippolyte
i
want
to
see
candia
no
do
not
go
there
now
begged
george
you
will
see
her
on
your
return
that
is
so
i
will
see
her
on
my
return
colas
she
stumbled
as
she
entered
the
path
take
care
cautioned
the
shadow
of
the
old
man
george
offered
her
his
arm
do
you
want
to
lean
on
me
she
took
george
s
arm
they
walked
several
steps
in
silence
the
night
was
bright
glorious
in
all
directions
the
great
bear
shone
on
their
heads
in
all
its
sextuple
mystery
silent
and
pure
as
the
heaven
above
the
adriatic
gave
as
the
only
indication
of
its
existence
its
respiration
and
its
perfume
why
do
you
hurry
so
asked
hippolyte
george
slowed
down
his
step
dominated
by
a
single
thought
pursued
by
the
necessity
of
the
act
he
had
only
a
confused
consciousness
for
everything
else
his
inner
life
seemed
to
disintegrate
to
decompose
to
dissolve
in
a
heavy
fermentation
that
invaded
even
the
deepest
depths
of
his
being
and
brought
to
the
surface
shapeless
fragments
of
diverse
nature
as
little
recognizable
as
if
they
had
not
belonged
to
the
life
of
the
same
man
all
these
strange
inextricable
abrupt
violent
things
he
vaguely
perceived
as
if
in
a
while
at
the
same
time
one
single
point
in
his
brain
retained
an
extraordinary
lucidity
and
in
a
rigid
line
guided
him
toward
the
fatal
act
how
melancholy
the
sound
of
the
flax
brake
in
that
field
is
said
hippolyte
stopping
all
night
long
they
beat
the
flax
does
that
not
make
you
feel
melancholy
she
abandoned
herself
on
george
s
arm
brushed
his
cheek
with
her
tresses
do
you
recall
at
albano
the
pavers
who
were
beating
the
pavement
from
morning
to
night
beneath
our
window
her
voice
was
veiled
with
sadness
somewhat
tired
we
became
accustomed
to
that
noise
she
stopped
restless
why
do
you
keep
turning
around
it
seems
to
me
that
i
hear
a
man
walking
barefoot
responded
george
in
a
low
voice
let
us
stop
they
stopped
listened
george
was
under
the
empire
of
the
same
horror
that
had
frozen
him
in
front
of
the
door
of
the
funereal
chamber
all
his
being
trembled
fascinated
by
the
mystery
he
seemed
to
have
already
crossed
the
confines
of
an
unknown
world
it
is
giardino
said
hippolyte
on
perceiving
the
dog
which
approached
he
has
followed
us
and
several
times
she
called
the
faithful
animal
which
came
running
up
friskily
she
bent
down
to
caress
him
spoke
to
him
in
the
special
tone
she
habitually
used
when
she
petted
animals
she
was
fond
of
you
never
leave
your
friend
do
you
you
never
leave
her
the
grateful
animal
rolled
in
the
dust
george
made
a
few
steps
he
felt
a
great
relief
on
feeling
himself
free
from
hippolyte
s
arm
up
to
now
this
contact
had
given
him
an
indefinable
physical
uneasiness
he
imagined
the
sudden
and
violent
act
he
was
about
to
accomplish
he
imagined
the
mortal
embrace
of
his
arms
around
the
body
of
this
woman
and
he
would
have
liked
to
touch
her
only
at
the
supreme
instant
come
come
we
ll
soon
be
there
he
said
preceding
her
in
the
direction
of
the
whitened
by
the
moonlight
and
stars
he
halted
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
and
turned
around
to
assure
himself
that
she
was
following
him
once
more
he
gazed
around
him
distractedly
as
if
to
embrace
the
image
of
the
night
it
seemed
to
him
that
on
this
plateau
the
silence
had
become
more
profound
only
the
rhythmic
beats
of
the
flax
brake
could
be
heard
from
the
distant
fields
come
he
repeated
in
a
clear
voice
strengthened
by
a
sudden
energy
and
passing
between
the
twisted
trunks
feeling
beneath
his
feet
the
softness
of
the
grass
he
directed
his
steps
towards
the
edge
of
the
precipice
this
edge
formed
a
circular
projection
entirely
free
in
every
direction
without
any
kind
of
railing
george
pressed
his
hands
on
his
knees
bent
his
body
forward
on
this
support
and
advanced
his
head
cautiously
he
examined
the
rocks
below
him
he
saw
a
corner
of
the
sandy
beach
the
little
corpse
stretched
out
on
the
sand
reappeared
to
him
there
appeared
to
him
also
the
blackish
spot
he
had
seen
with
hippolyte
from
the
heights
of
the
pincio
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
he
heard
again
the
answers
of
the
teamster
to
the
man
and
confusedly
all
the
phantoms
of
that
distant
afternoon
repassed
before
his
soul
take
care
cried
hippolyte
as
she
came
up
to
him
take
care
the
dog
barked
among
the
do
you
hear
me
george
come
away
the
promontory
fell
perpendicularly
down
to
the
black
and
deserted
rocks
around
which
the
water
scarcely
moved
splashing
feebly
rocking
in
its
slow
undulations
the
reflections
of
the
stars
george
george
have
no
fear
he
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
come
nearer
come
come
and
see
the
fishermen
fishing
by
torchlight
among
the
rocks
no
no
i
am
afraid
of
vertigo
come
i
will
hold
you
no
no
she
seemed
frozen
by
the
unusual
tone
in
george
s
voice
and
a
vague
fright
commenced
to
invade
her
come
and
he
approached
her
his
hands
extended
suddenly
he
seized
her
wrists
dragged
her
several
steps
then
he
seized
her
in
his
arms
made
a
bound
and
attempted
to
force
her
towards
the
abyss
no
no
no
she
resisted
with
furious
energy
she
succeeded
in
disengaging
herself
jumped
back
panting
and
trembling
are
you
mad
she
cried
choked
by
anger
are
you
mad
but
when
she
saw
him
come
after
her
without
speaking
a
word
when
she
felt
herself
seized
with
more
brutal
violence
and
dragged
again
toward
the
precipice
she
understood
all
and
a
great
sinister
flash
of
light
struck
terror
to
her
soul
no
george
no
let
me
be
let
me
be
only
one
minute
listen
listen
one
minute
i
want
to
tell
insane
with
terror
she
supplicated
him
writhing
she
hoped
to
stop
him
to
move
him
to
pity
one
minute
listen
i
love
you
forgive
me
forgive
me
she
stammered
incoherent
words
desperately
feeling
herself
becoming
weaker
losing
her
ground
seeing
death
before
her
assassin
she
then
shrieked
furious
and
she
defended
herself
with
her
nails
with
her
teeth
like
a
beast
assassin
she
shrieked
as
she
was
seized
by
the
hair
thrown
to
the

on
the
edge
of

lost
the
dog
barked
at
the

it
was
a

and
fierce
struggle
like

outburst
of
supreme
hate
which
up
to
then
had
been
smouldering
unsuspected
in
the
hearts
of
implacable
enemies
