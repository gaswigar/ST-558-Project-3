mollie
june
s
substitute
the
professor
on
a
john
merriam
principal
of
the
high
school
at
riceville
illinois
professor
merriam
as
he
was
universally
called
by
the
citizens
of
riceville
was
wickedly
carnally
gloriously
happy
he
was
having
an
unwonted
spree
i
fear
the
reader
will
be
shocked
the
principal
of
a
high
school
he
will
say
has
no
right
to
a
spree
even
an
occasional
one
the
professor
has
girl
students
in
his
classes
mostly
girls
indeed
and
usually
the
prettiest
ones
in
town
and
women
teachers
under
his
supervision
every
seventh
day
he
teaches
a
young
people
s
class
in
a
sunday
school
he
makes
addresses
at
meetings
of
the
the
and
other
alphabetically
designated
societies
that
make
for
righteousness
and
decorum
he
should
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
be
a
model
an
exemplar
to
the
budding
young
men
and
women
of
the
community
in
general
and
his
school
in
particular
in
this
reasoning
the
reader
is
in
strict
accord
with
what
the
sentiment
of
all
riceville
would
have
been
if
it
had
known
if
it
could
have
known
nevertheless
it
is
the
regrettable
and
shocking
fact
that
john
merriam
was
sitting
on
that
pleasant
april
evening
in
the
peacock
cabaret
of
the
hotel
de
soto
in
the
wicked
city
of
chicago
he
was
attired
in
evening
clothes
a
fact
which
in
itself
would
have
seemed
both
odd
and
reprehensible
to
riceville
and
he
was
alone
at
a
tiny
table
with
a
lamp
he
had
just
been
guided
to
that
table
and
pending
the
arrival
of
a
waiter
he
was
gazing
eagerly
boyishly
about
him
at
such
delights
as
the
somewhat
garish
peacock
cabaret
displayed
for
john
merriam
though
a
professor
was
young
he
was
only
he
was
tall
and
blond
and
athletic
as
young
men
who
grow
up
on
farms
in
the
middle
west
and
then
go
to
college
have
a
way
of
being
and
after
his
season
of
strenuous
and
highly
virtuous
labours
at
riceville
he
was
really
hungry
keen
for
something
well
just
a
little
less
virtuous
a
distinguished
looking
gentleman
in
a
dinner
jacket
conspicuously
labeled
with
a
number
somewhat
haughtily
and
negligently
approached
bearing
a
menu
card
about
three
paces
away
this
gentleman
having
glanced
at
young
merriam
fairly
stopped
and
stared
at
him
an
odd
expression
showed
upon
his
face
an
expression
one
would
almost
have
said
of
intense
animosity
then
as
he
still
stared
one
might
have
decided
that
his
look
betokened
perplexity
he
winked
his
eyes
several
times
and
once
more
scrutinised
his
waiting
guest
at
length
perhaps
ten
seconds
had
passed
his
face
slowly
wonderingly
cleared
his
usual
air
of
vacant
indifference
returned
and
he
advanced
and
placed
the
menu
card
in
merriam
s
hands
the
latter
still
drinking
in
the
sights
and
sounds
of
his
unaccustomed
environment
had
noticed
nothing
now
it
is
always
prudent
to
note
a
waiter
s
number
when
he
first
presents
himself
for
in
case
he
should
decide
to
begin
his
summer
vacation
immediately
after
taking
your
order
you
may
need
to
mention
his
number
to
the
head
waiter
in
this
case
the
number
was
the
hauteur
and
negligence
displayed
were
partly
habitual
professional
so
to
speak
but
were
intensified
perhaps
by
the
reaction
from
the
emotion
whatever
it
was
which
he
had
apparently
just
experienced
perhaps
also
by
the
look
of
alert
and
genuine
pleasure
on
merriam
s
face
such
a
look
did
not
wholly
commend
itself
or
him
to
a
sophisticated
metropolitan
taste
what
right
had
a
patron
of
the
peacock
cabaret
to
look
really
pleased
it
was
hardly
decent
and
argued
a
small
tip
inwardly
merriam
now
aware
of
the
waiter
s
presence
reacted
acutely
to
this
clearly
perceptible
disdain
which
shows
how
young
and
how
rural
he
was
we
maturer
urban
folk
are
never
of
course
in
the
least
nonplused
by
those
contemptuous
blasé
silences
of
waiters
who
possess
the
bearing
and
manner
of
a
governor
or
a
capitalist
but
john
merriam
had
been
excellent
in
amateur
dramatics
at
college
and
he
now
roused
himself
to
a
magnificent
histrionic
effort
in
the
rôle
of
man
of
the
world
he
pushed
the
menu
card
aside
without
looking
at
it
a
clam
cocktail
please
and
a
stein
of
beer
he
murmured
low
enough
to
force
the
distinguished
one
to
unbend
slightly
in
order
to
catch
the
words
yes
sir
said
waiter
no
with
a
tentative
suggestion
of
respect
in
his
tone
a
customer
who
did
not
bother
to
look
at
the
menu
might
be
worth
while
after
all
and
then
what
i
ll
see
how
i
feel
then
said
merriam
with
a
half
yawn
yes
sir
said
waiter
no
almost
courteously
and
departed
at
a
pace
slightly
quickened
over
that
of
his
approach
as
a
man
strolling
at
complete
leisure
will
instinctively
increase
the
tempo
of
his
step
if
he
chances
to
recall
a
definite
engagement
on
the
day
after
merriam
grinned
delightedly
he
had
put
it
across
his
little
piece
of
acting
he
had
measurably
imposed
his
rôle
on
his
audience
of
one
at
least
he
had
shaken
him
and
then
i
shudder
when
i
recall
the
views
on
nicotine
of
the
board
of
education
at
riceville
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
package
of
cigarettes
and
took
a
match
from
the
table
and
lit
a
cigarette
and
sent
a
volume
of
smoke
out
through
his
nostrils
proving
alas
that
it
was
not
his
first
indulgence
and
with
a
sigh
that
might
almost
be
described
as
ecstatic
turned
his
attention
again
to
the
scene
about
him
that
scene
was
piquant
to
him
after
the
ugly
dining
room
of
his
boarding
house
at
riceville
and
the
barren
assembly
hall
of
the
high
school
to
a
degree
almost
incredible
to
persons
more
habituated
to
the
peacock
cabaret
and
similar
resorts
not
being
quite
so
fresh
from
riceville
nor
yet
the
advertising
manager
of
the
hotel
de
soto
i
can
not
i
fear
paint
the
prospect
as
merriam
saw
it
i
shall
not
be
able
to
conceal
some
mental
reservations
as
to
its
charms
the
purple
peacocks
upon
the
walls
and
ceiling
from
which
the
restaurant
took
its
name
were
certainly
a
trifle
just
as
the
music
which
the
orchestra
intermittently
dispensed
was
too
much
syncopated
again
the
scores
of
small
tables
each
with
its
lamp
its
slim
glass
vase
for
a
single
rosebud
its
water
bottle
bearing
the
arms
of
the
chevalier
de
soto
and
its
ash
receptacle
all
alike
as
shoe
boxes
in
a
shoe
shop
are
alike
might
to
a
tired
fancy
suggest
a
certain
monotony
of
pleasure
a
brand
of
bliss
the
small
skimped
stage
with
its
undeniably
banal
curtain
and
the
crowded
dancing
floor
did
not
really
promise
unlimited
delights
some
perception
of
all
this
was
apparent
in
the
faces
and
bearing
of
many
of
the
men
who
sat
at
the
scores
of
tables
and
of
the
women
who
were
with
them
however
the
raiment
of
the
latter
might
be
not
a
few
indeed
displayed
an
air
of
languor
and
ennui
that
might
have
won
approval
even
from
waiter
no
but
in
speaking
thus
of
the
peacock
cabaret
i
am
stepping
outside
my
story
violating
unity
of
point
of
view
in
short
committing
a
heinous
literary
crime
for
to
merriam
at
that
moment
the
screaming
purple
peacocks
the
regiments
of
rosebuds
the
musical
comedy
melodies
the
gay
attire
and
bare
shoulders
of
the
women
and
even
the
tired
look
of
his
which
he
interpreted
as
sophistication
rather
than
simple
boredom
were
thrillingly
symbolical
of
all
the
delights
which
the
great
world
held
and
which
were
absent
from
riceville
and
when
waiter
no
leisurely
returned
to
find
him
outwardly
almost
too
near
asleep
to
keep
his
cigarette
going
and
deposited
his
clam
cocktail
and
the
wicked
stein
before
him
and
at
the
same
moment
the
orchestra
became
more
noisy
than
ever
and
all
the
lights
except
those
upon
the
tables
went
out
and
the
stage
curtain
rose
upon
a
chorus
he
was
really
in
a
sort
of
omar
khayyam
paradise
it
was
lucky
that
waiter
no
had
again
departed
to
those
unknown
regions
where
waiters
spend
the
bulk
of
their
time
for
merriam
could
not
have
concealed
the
zest
with
which
he
alternately
ate
and
drank
and
surveyed
the
moderately
comely
demoiselles
upon
the
little
stage
having
finished
his
cocktail
and
drunk
some
of
his
beer
and
seen
the
curtain
descend
on
the
first
act
of
the
cabaret
s
dramatic
entertainment
merriam
lit
another
cigarette
shifted
his
chair
and
settled
himself
to
await
the
probable
future
return
of
his
servitor
his
thoughts
dwelt
contentedly
on
the
evening
before
him
for
after
his
meal
he
would
have
a
stroll
with
a
cigar
in
the
spring
twilight
it
was
barely
then
through
the
noisy
brightly
lighted
streets
of
the
loop
which
never
failed
to
thrill
him
with
a
sense
of
a
somehow
wicked
vastness
power
and
riches
in
the
great
city
of
which
they
were
the
center
and
then
he
was
going
to
the
follies
he
fingered
the
small
envelope
in
his
pocket
which
held
his
ticket
and
after
the
show
he
would
have
a
supper
in
another
cabaret
beyond
that
he
did
not
let
his
fancy
wander
for
after
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
catch
the
train
on
the
illinois
central
that
would
carry
him
back
to
riceville
for
the
remaining
six
weeks
of
the
school
year
he
had
come
up
to
chicago
on
this
spring
day
a
tuesday
it
was
to
attend
a
convention
of
principals
and
to
engage
a
couple
of
new
teachers
for
the
next
year
to
replace
two
that
were
to
be
married
in
june
and
he
had
faithfully
done
these
things
and
now
he
was
giving
himself
just
this
one
evening
of
amusement
two
cabaret
meals
and
a
show
sauced
so
to
speak
with
a
little
tobacco
and
beer
and
the
wearing
of
his
evening
clothes
surely
whatever
riceville
might
have
thought
he
will
not
seem
to
most
of
us
very
derelict
from
the
austere
ideals
of
his
profession
the
only
real
point
against
him
most
of
us
might
argue
lies
in
the
fact
that
when
you
touch
even
the
outermost
fringes
of
the
night
life
of
a
city
you
are
never
quite
certain
what
may
come
to
you
for
there
are
things
happening
all
about
you
under
the
conventional
monotonous
surface
things
amusing
and
things
terrible
men
and
women
playing
with
the
fire
of
every
known
human
passion
and
if
the
finger
of
some
adventure
reaches
out
for
you
you
may
not
be
able
to
resist
its
lure
perhaps
even
to
escape
its
clutch
prettiest
i
have
said
that
merriam
had
shifted
his
chair
a
little
as
he
lit
his
second
cigarette
a
moment
later
he
was
looking
very
hard
at
a
certain
pretty
woman
at
a
table
half
way
across
the
room
his
heart
stopped
at
least
that
is
the
phrase
a
novelist
seems
to
be
required
to
use
to
indicate
the
sudden
pulse
of
amazement
and
pleasure
and
alarm
which
he
certainly
felt
the
young
woman
at
whom
he
was
staring
had
a
name
which
is
very
important
for
this
story
and
which
i
shall
presently
tell
you
but
in
john
merriam
s
mind
her
name
was
the
prettiest
girl
and
her
other
name
which
he
seldom
dared
whisper
to
his
heart
was
mollie
june
she
was
from
riceville
hence
the
alarm
with
which
his
pleasure
was
mixed
and
during
his
first
four
months
of
teaching
three
years
before
she
had
been
in
his
senior
class
in
the
high
school
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
class
and
in
the
school
and
in
the
town
and
in
the
state
and
the
united
states
and
the
world
if
you
had
asked
john
merriam
advanced
algebra
with
mollie
june
in
the
class
had
been
the
most
golden
of
sciences
pleasure
squared
delight
cubed
and
bliss
to
the
power
i
am
not
myself
absolutely
convinced
of
mollie
june
s
proficiency
in
solving
quadratic
equations
yet
the
official
records
of
the
riceville
high
school
show
that
she
received
the
highest
mark
in
the
class
but
she
was
the
daughter
of
james
partridge
the
owner
of
all
riceville
that
is
to
say
of
the
coal
mines
outside
the
town
of
the
grain
elevator
of
the
street
car
and
electric
light
company
and
of
the
first
national
bank
who
was
john
merriam
the
son
of
a
poor
farmer
in
a
southern
county
who
had
worked
his
way
through
college
and
come
out
with
nothing
but
a
degree
a
football
reputation
that
was
quite
unnegotiable
and
three
hundred
dollars
of
fraternity
debts
an
enormous
sum
to
mix
anything
warmer
or
livelier
than
in
his
thoughts
of
a
class
to
which
mollie
june
partridge
deigned
to
belong
even
if
mollie
june
herself
did
come
up
to
his
desk
in
the
assembly
room
two
or
three
times
a
week
for
help
in
her
algebra
and
spend
most
of
the
time
asking
him
about
college
instead
and
join
his
young
people
s
class
which
she
had
previously
refused
to
attend
and
allow
him
to
see
her
home
from
church
sociables
and
compel
that
docile
magnate
john
partridge
her
father
to
invite
the
new
professor
to
dinner
twice
during
the
half
year
as
well
almost
might
a
humble
tutor
in
the
castle
of
a
feudal
lord
have
raised
his
eyes
to
the
baron
s
daughter
almost
but
not
quite
after
all
this
is
a
free
republic
even
a
poor
pedagogue
is
a
citizen
with
a
vote
and
a
potential
candidate
for
the
presidency
which
at
least
two
poor
pedagogues
have
attained
so
john
merriam
permitted
himself
to
be
very
happy
during
those
four
months
and
was
not
in
the
least
hopeless
only
he
saw
that
he
must
bide
his
time
but
early
in
january
mollie
june
left
school
and
in
a
few
days
it
came
out
that
she
had
left
to
be
married
married
to
senator
norman
senator
norman
was
the
famous
boy
senator
from
illinois
at
the
time
of
his
election
the
youngest
man
who
had
ever
sat
in
the
upper
house
of
congress
the
ruddiness
of
his
cheeks
the
abundance
of
his
wavy
blond
hair
and
the
athletic
jauntiness
of
his
carriage
won
votes
whenever
he
stumped
the
state
they
went
far
to
counteract
malicious
insinuations
as
to
the
means
by
which
he
was
rolling
up
a
fortune
and
his
solidity
with
interests
which
the
proletariat
viewed
with
suspicion
and
now
having
been
a
widower
for
eighteen
months
his
first
wife
was
older
than
he
and
had
brought
him
money
he
had
stayed
for
a
during
the
christmas
holidays
with
james
partridge
who
was
a
cousin
of
the
senator
s
first
wife
and
his
political
lieutenant
for
a
certain
group
of
counties
and
had
seen
mollie
june
and
wanted
her
and
asked
for
her
and
got
her
as
george
norman
always
asked
for
and
got
whatever
he
wanted
all
this
was
of
course
in
john
merriam
s
mind
as
he
gazed
across
a
dozen
tables
in
the
peacock
cabaret
at
the
unchanged
profile
of
the
prettiest
girl
that
is
to
say
mrs
senator
norman
and
with
it
came
an
acute
revival
of
the
desolation
of
that
january
and
february
at
riceville
when
he
had
perceived
with
the
hebrew
sage
that
in
much
learning
or
in
little
for
that
matter
is
much
weariness
and
that
algebra
should
have
been
buried
with
the
medieval
arabians
who
invented
it
when
even
the
state
championship
in
basket
ball
won
by
the
riceville
five
under
his
coaching
was
only
a
trouble
and
a
bore
there
is
no
doubt
he
stared
rudely
at
least
it
would
have
been
rudely
if
his
eyes
had
held
the
look
which
eyes
that
stare
at
pretty
women
commonly
hold
but
such
a
look
as
stood
in
merriam
s
eyes
can
hardly
be
rude
however
intent
and
prolonged
it
may
be
he
was
merely
entranced
in
the
literal
sense
of
that
word
her
girlish
white
shoulders
he
had
never
seen
her
shoulders
before
in
riceville
women
no
more
have
shoulders
than
they
have
legs
the
soft
brown
hair
over
her
ears
even
the
mode
of
the
day
which
called
for
close
net
effects
and
tight
knobs
could
not
conceal
its
fine
softness
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
which
unquestionably
shamed
all
the
neighbouring
rosebuds
the
quite
inexplicable
deliciousness
of
those
particular
small
curves
described
by
the
lines
of
her
nose
and
chin
and
throat
as
he
saw
them
in
half
profile
were
more
than
he
could
draw
his
eyes
away
from
for
an
unconscionable
number
of
seconds
of
her
charmingly
simple
and
unquestionably
very
expensive
frock
as
a
separate
fact
and
of
the
thin
pale
and
elderly
but
gorgeously
arrayed
woman
who
was
her
companion
he
had
no
clear
perception
but
undoubtedly
they
both
contributed
along
with
the
lights
and
colours
and
music
of
the
peacock
cabaret
to
the
deplorable
confusion
of
his
mind
out
of
that
confusion
there
presently
arose
certain
clear
images
and
tones
and
words
which
made
up
his
memory
of
the
last
time
he
had
seen
and
spoken
with
the
present
mrs
senator
norman
it
was
at
and
after
a
miscellaneous
kind
of
young
people
s
entertainment
which
occurred
at
the
methodist
church
on
the
evening
of
that
bitter
day
on
which
the
news
of
her
engagement
to
senator
norman
had
run
like
a
prairie
fire
through
the
streets
and
homes
of
riceville
fiercely
incinerating
all
other
topics
of
conversation
and
consuming
also
the
joy
in
life
the
ambition
the
very
youth
it
seemed
to
him
of
john
merriam
he
would
not
have
gone
to
that
entertainment
if
he
could
have
escaped
but
there
were
to
be
charades
and
he
had
arranged
and
coached
most
of
them
and
was
to
be
in
several
he
simply
had
to
go
as
ricevillians
might
have
said
she
was
there
with
her
mother
when
had
she
ever
come
just
with
her
mother
that
is
to
say
without
a
male
escort
before
that
fact
alone
was
symbolical
of
the
closing
of
the
gates
of
matrimony
upon
her
naturally
in
his
pain
he
followed
his
primitive
and
childish
instincts
and
avoided
her
but
he
was
aware
he
was
almost
sure
of
her
eyes
continually
following
him
throughout
the
evening
and
during
refreshments
she
deliberately
came
up
to
him
and
said
that
her
mother
was
obliged
to
leave
early
and
would
he
see
her
home
well
of
course
if
she
asked
him
he
had
to
i
am
afraid
that
the
tone
if
not
the
words
of
his
reply
said
as
much
and
mollie
june
had
turned
away
with
quick
tears
in
her
eyes
yet
i
question
whether
she
was
really
hurt
by
his
rudeness
for
why
should
he
be
rude
when
he
had
never
been
so
before
unless
he
to
use
the
most
expressive
of
americanisms
cared
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
as
a
result
of
those
tears
which
he
had
seen
it
was
his
eyes
that
followed
her
while
hers
avoided
him
but
he
did
not
speak
with
her
again
until
time
arrived
mollie
june
lingered
till
the
very
end
of
everything
perhaps
the
little
girl
in
her
for
she
was
barely
eighteen
clung
to
this
last
shred
of
the
familiar
homely
social
life
of
her
girlhood
before
she
should
be
plunged
into
the
frightful
brilliance
of
real
society
in
terrific
places
known
as
chicago
and
washington
as
a
senator
s
wife
but
at
last
they
were
walking
together
towards
her
home
take
my
arm
please
said
mollie
june
the
boys
in
riceville
always
take
the
girls
arms
at
night
though
never
in
the
daytime
john
ought
to
have
taken
her
arm
before
he
took
it
have
you
heard
that
i
am
going
to
be
married
asked
mollie
june
as
if
she
did
not
know
that
everybody
in
the
county
knew
it
by
that
time
yes
said
john
his
tone
as
succinct
as
his
monosyllable
but
girls
learn
early
to
deal
with
the
conversational
difficulties
and
recalcitrances
of
males
under
stress
of
emotion
it
means
leaving
school
and
riceville
and
everything
said
mollie
june
john
could
not
fail
to
catch
the
note
of
pitifulness
in
her
sentence
if
the
prospective
marriage
had
been
with
any
one
less
dazzling
than
george
norman
he
might
have
reacted
more
properly
as
it
was
he
replied
with
a
stilted
impersonality
which
might
have
been
caught
from
the
bright
stars
shining
through
the
bare
branches
under
which
they
walked
you
will
have
a
very
rich
and
brilliant
life
he
said
i
suppose
so
said
mollie
june
they
walked
on
he
still
obediently
clutching
her
arm
in
silence
conversation
not
accompaniable
with
laughter
is
so
difficult
an
art
for
youth
presently
mollie
june
tried
again
aren
t
you
sorry
i
m
leaving
the
school
mr
merriam
i
m
very
sorry
indeed
responded
professor
merriam
you
ought
to
have
stayed
to
graduate
i
don
t
care
about
graduating
said
mollie
june
again
their
footsteps
echoed
in
the
cold
january
silence
then
mollie
june
made
a
third
attempt
you
look
ever
so
much
like
mr
norman
i
know
it
said
merriam
we
re
related
oh
on
my
mother
s
side
we
re
second
cousins
but
the
two
branches
of
the
family
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
now
he
has
the
same
hair
and
the
same
shape
of
head
and
the
same
way
of
sitting
and
moving
mollie
june
declared
with
enthusiasm
and
almost
the
same
eyes
and
voice
only
his
are
older
said
john
merriam
rudely
yes
said
mollie
june
distances
are
not
great
in
riceville
for
this
reason
the
ceremony
of
seeing
home
is
usually
termed
by
a
circuitous
route
sometimes
involving
the
entire
circumference
of
the
nice
part
of
the
town
but
on
this
occasion
john
and
mollie
june
had
gone
directly
as
though
their
object
had
been
to
arrive
they
reached
her
home
a
matter
of
two
blocks
from
the
another
word
had
been
said
there
mollie
june
carefully
extricated
her
arm
from
his
mechanical
grasp
and
confronted
him
he
looked
at
her
face
peeping
out
of
the
fur
collar
of
her
coat
in
the
starlight
and
for
one
instant
into
her
eyes
she
was
saying
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
merriam
for
all
the
help
you
have
given
me
in
algebra
he
ought
to
have
kissed
her
she
wanted
him
to
he
half
divined
as
much
afterwards
but
the
awkward
callow
rural
pedagogical
cub
in
him
replied
i
am
glad
if
i
have
been
able
to
help
you
in
anything
that
i
judge
was
too
much
for
mollie
june
she
held
out
her
little
gloved
hand
mr
merriam
he
took
her
hand
and
now
appears
the
advantage
of
a
college
education
including
amateur
dramatics
and
courses
in
english
poetry
and
romantic
fiction
he
did
what
no
other
swain
in
riceville
could
have
done
he
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
at
least
he
kissed
the
glove
which
tightly
enclosed
the
hand
mollie
june
he
said
using
that
name
for
the
first
time
then
he
dropped
her
hand
somewhat
suddenly
i
fear
turned
abruptly
and
walked
rapidly
away
as
to
what
mollie
june
said
or
thought
or
felt
how
should
i
know
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
but
to
go
into
the
house
and
that
is
what
she
did
john
merriam
raised
his
eyes
from
the
on
which
they
had
rested
while
these
images
from
the
distant
past
two
and
years
ago
moved
across
the
screen
of
his
memory
to
his
now
mature
perceptions
the
stupidity
and
gaucherie
of
his
own
part
in
that
scene
save
for
the
redeeming
kissing
of
the
glove
were
clearly
apparent
and
were
for
the
moment
almost
as
painful
to
him
as
the
fact
that
mollie
june
was
another
man
s
wife
he
glanced
around
avoiding
only
the
table
at
which
mrs
senator
norman
sat
the
glory
was
gone
from
the
peacock
cabaret
the
garishness
of
the
peacocks
the
of
the
music
the
futility
of
beer
and
cigarettes
and
evening
clothes
were
desolatingly
revealed
to
him
he
put
his
cigarette
aside
to
smoke
itself
up
unregarded
on
the
ash
tray
it
had
been
his
duty
to
forget
and
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
justice
to
say
that
after
a
fashion
he
had
succeeded
in
doing
so
his
winter
and
spring
three
years
ago
had
been
miserable
but
he
had
undeniably
enjoyed
his
summer
vacation
and
had
found
interest
in
his
work
again
in
the
fall
to
be
sure
the
edge
was
gone
from
his
ambition
he
had
stuck
ploddingly
at
teaching
too
indifferent
to
try
to
better
himself
still
he
had
not
been
actively
unhappy
but
now
he
was
diverted
by
the
return
of
waiter
no
no
need
of
now
to
conceal
any
unsophisticated
delight
in
his
surroundings
but
he
must
pull
himself
together
he
must
not
exhibit
to
the
world
as
incarnated
in
waiter
no
a
depression
as
boyish
as
his
previous
pleasure
he
must
still
be
the
stoical
tranquil
man
of
the
world
who
knows
women
and
tears
them
from
his
heart
when
need
be
it
was
the
same
rôle
with
a
difference
what
next
sir
merriam
glanced
hastily
at
the
menu
card
and
ordered
a
steak
with
french
fried
potatoes
and
a
salad
he
was
not
up
to
an
attack
on
any
unfamiliar
viands
as
he
gave
his
order
he
was
aware
of
a
party
of
three
persons
seated
a
little
to
his
left
the
opposite
direction
from
the
fateful
spot
inhabited
by
mollie
june
who
seemed
to
be
taking
particular
note
of
him
and
as
he
lit
another
cigarette
after
the
waiter
had
left
him
he
noticed
them
again
unquestionably
they
were
furtively
regarding
him
now
and
then
they
exchanged
remarks
of
which
he
was
sure
he
was
the
subject
the
three
persons
included
a
man
of
about
a
pale
priest
and
a
very
beautiful
woman
the
woman
had
not
only
shoulders
and
arms
but
also
a
great
deal
of
bosom
and
back
all
dazzlingly
powderedly
fair
and
ideally
plump
she
had
black
hair
and
eyes
brilliantly
even
aggressively
black
her
gown
was
a
lavender
silk
net
with
spangles
her
age
well
she
was
certainly
older
than
mollie
june
and
certainly
within
safely
within
the
age
at
which
women
cease
to
be
interesting
to
men
whatever
that
age
may
be
our
youthful
man
of
the
world
was
a
little
embarrassed
at
first
by
the
scrutiny
of
this
gorgeous
trio
he
glanced
quickly
down
at
his
own
attire
as
a
girl
might
have
done
but
there
could
be
nothing
wrong
with
his
evening
clothes
a
man
is
so
safe
in
that
respect
they
were
only
five
years
old
having
been
acquired
in
a
heroic
burst
of
extravagance
during
his
senior
year
in
college
he
wanted
to
put
his
hand
up
to
his
white
bow
to
make
sure
it
was
not
askew
but
restrained
himself
presently
merriam
began
to
enjoy
the
attention
he
was
receiving
if
one
must
play
a
part
it
is
pleasant
to
have
an
audience
it
helped
him
to
keep
his
eyes
off
mollie
june
he
began
to
give
attention
to
the
smoking
of
his
cigarette
he
handled
it
with
nonchalant
grace
he
exhaled
smoke
through
his
nostrils
he
recalled
an
envied
accomplishment
of
his
college
days
and
carefully
blew
a
couple
of
tolerably
perfect
smoke
rings
and
he
wished
that
mollie
june
would
turn
and
see
him
in
his
evening
clothes
presently
the
clerical
gentleman
after
an
earnest
colloquy
with
the
one
rose
and
came
across
to
merriam
s
table
while
the
other
two
now
openly
watched
the
priest
rested
two
white
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
bent
over
him
with
a
friendly
smile
will
you
pardon
a
frank
question
from
a
stranger
he
asked
i
guess
a
question
won
t
hurt
me
said
merriam
at
this
simple
reply
the
cleric
straightened
up
quickly
as
if
startled
and
looked
at
merriam
closely
and
curiously
then
he
said
are
you
by
any
chance
related
to
senator
norman
yes
i
am
said
merriam
may
i
ask
what
the
relationship
is
merriam
told
him
thank
you
said
the
priest
the
resemblance
is
really
remarkable
and
we
saw
you
looking
at
norman
do
you
know
her
yes
i
knew
her
before
before
she
was
married
i
see
thank
you
so
much
the
inquisitive
priest
returned
to
his
friends
who
appeared
to
listen
intently
to
his
report
at
the
same
time
waiter
no
arrived
with
merriam
s
steak
and
salad
he
ate
feeling
himself
still
under
observation
from
the
other
table
but
when
he
was
half
way
through
his
salad
his
attention
was
effectually
distracted
from
those
watchers
for
mollie
june
and
her
companion
had
risen
to
go
merriam
put
down
his
fork
and
looked
at
her
she
was
really
beautiful
to
any
eyes
so
fresh
and
young
and
alive
amid
the
tawdry
ennui
of
her
surroundings
a
human
girl
among
the
labouring
ghosts
of
a
to
merriam
she
was
what
you
will
radiant
divine
he
wished
he
had
not
lost
a
moment
from
looking
at
her
since
he
first
saw
her
a
waiter
had
brought
a
fur
cloak
and
now
held
it
for
her
as
she
adjusted
it
about
her
shoulders
she
glanced
around
and
saw
merriam
for
a
moment
she
looked
straight
at
him
merriam
would
have
sworn
that
her
colour
heightened
ever
so
little
and
then
paled
she
smiled
a
mechanical
little
smile
bowed
slightly
spoke
to
her
companion
and
threaded
her
way
quickly
among
tables
to
an
exit
i
beg
your
pardon
merriam
started
and
looked
up
to
find
the
woman
from
the
other
table
standing
beside
him
he
was
conscious
of
a
faint
fragrance
which
a
more
sophisticated
person
would
have
recognised
as
that
of
an
extremely
expensive
perfume
widely
advertised
under
the
name
of
a
famous
opera
singer
he
rose
mechanically
dropping
his
napkin
no
no
she
smiled
won
t
you
sit
down
and
let
me
sit
down
a
moment
too
she
took
the
chair
opposite
him
my
name
is
alicia
wayward
she
said
there
was
a
kind
of
deliberate
sweetness
in
her
tone
john
merriam
got
back
somehow
into
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
but
did
not
reply
his
eyes
saw
the
face
of
mollie
june
peeping
out
of
her
furs
as
on
that
last
night
at
riceville
her
changing
colour
her
mechanical
smile
and
the
hurrying
away
without
giving
him
a
chance
to
go
to
her
for
a
single
word
won
t
you
tell
me
your
name
said
alicia
with
the
barest
suggestion
in
her
voice
of
sharpness
in
the
midst
of
sweet
john
merriam
and
you
are
a
second
cousin
of
senator
norman
yes
i
am
an
old
friend
of
senator
norman
s
said
alicia
we
are
all
friends
of
his
she
nodded
towards
the
other
table
and
we
should
very
much
like
to
have
a
little
private
talk
with
you
about
a
very
important
how
do
you
do
simpson
merriam
looked
up
again
waiter
no
was
standing
over
them
but
he
was
a
transformed
being
the
ramrod
had
somehow
been
extracted
from
his
spine
and
his
stern
features
were
transfigured
in
an
expression
of
happy
and
ingratiating
servility
very
well
miss
alicia
he
said
simpson
used
to
be
my
father
s
butler
explained
miss
wayward
we
ve
never
had
so
a
butler
since
thank
you
miss
alicia
said
simpson
fervently
send
me
the
head
waiter
said
miss
wayward
yes
miss
alicia
and
simpson
departed
almost
with
alacrity
you
are
just
ready
for
your
dessert
i
see
said
alicia
i
am
going
to
ask
the
head
waiter
to
change
us
both
to
one
of
the
private
rooms
and
give
us
simpson
to
wait
on
us
then
i
can
present
you
to
my
friends
and
we
can
have
the
private
talk
i
spoke
of
you
don
t
mind
do
you
merriam
thought
of
the
follies
but
the
idea
of
the
follies
bored
him
after
seeing
mollie
june
and
one
can
not
refuse
a
lady
he
recaptured
some
fraction
of
his
manners
i
shall
be
pleased
he
said
thank
you
said
alicia
with
augmented
sweetness
unscrupulous
the
head
waiter
arrived
could
they
be
removed
to
a
private
most
certainly
they
could
yes
simpson
should
serve
them
obviously
anything
that
miss
alicia
wayward
desired
could
be
done
must
be
done
and
it
was
done
they
ordered
ices
and
and
a
liqueur
suggested
alicia
merriam
assented
what
should
you
prefer
now
merriam
knew
the
name
of
just
one
liqueur
he
made
prompt
use
of
that
solitary
scrap
of
information
benedictine
perhaps
he
suggested
as
who
should
say
out
of
all
the
world
s
vintages
my
mature
choice
among
liqueurs
is
benedictine
good
smiled
alicia
i
am
afraid
she
was
not
effectually
deceived
merriam
was
introduced
first
to
father
murray
he
isn
t
a
real
father
said
alicia
he
s
not
a
romanist
only
a
paltry
anglican
but
he
s
so
very
very
high
church
that
a
layman
can
hardly
tell
the
difference
father
murray
was
deprecatory
but
unruffled
a
christian
priest
must
forgive
all
things
this
is
philip
rockwell
of
the
reform
league
said
alicia
his
fame
has
doubtless
reached
you
his
fame
had
not
reached
merriam
but
the
latter
bowed
and
shook
hands
as
though
it
had
instinctively
meeting
the
stare
in
the
other
man
s
eyes
with
an
unblinking
steadiness
of
his
own
after
the
introductions
merriam
glanced
about
him
with
perhaps
insufficiently
concealed
curiosity
he
had
never
been
in
a
private
before
and
this
adventure
was
beginning
to
interest
him
it
was
better
than
spending
his
evening
his
one
evening
in
sad
thoughts
of
mollie
june
the
room
was
just
large
enough
to
afford
comfortable
space
for
a
table
for
four
persons
with
a
small
sideboard
to
serve
from
it
was
really
rather
pretty
subdued
purple
hangings
at
the
door
and
windows
and
a
frieze
of
small
peacocks
above
the
plate
rail
indicated
its
affiliation
so
to
speak
with
the
peacock
cabaret
there
were
attractive
french
prints
in
garland
frames
on
the
walls
the
table
was
charmingly
laid
with
a
bowl
of
yellow
roses
in
the
center
and
the
ices
were
already
served
on
the
sideboard
the
coffee
in
a
silver
pot
was
bubbling
over
an
alcohol
flame
and
there
was
a
long
bottle
which
merriam
correctly
interpreted
as
the
container
of
his
choice
among
liqueurs
this
is
much
cosier
isn
t
it
said
alicia
she
took
the
head
of
the
table
father
murray
shall
sit
opposite
me
she
said
to
see
that
i
behave
you
merriman
shall
sit
on
my
right
as
the
guest
of
honour
that
leaves
this
place
for
you
philip
reformers
must
be
content
with
what
they
can
get
merriam
mustered
the
gallantry
to
hold
alicia
s
chair
for
her
and
was
warmed
by
the
approving
smile
with
which
she
thanked
him
he
had
not
especially
liked
alicia
at
first
but
she
grew
upon
him
they
consumed
ices
and
alicia
conversed
in
the
sprightly
fashion
she
affected
with
merriam
the
other
two
men
hardly
participated
at
all
in
the
course
of
that
conversation
alicia
artlessly
tactfully
but
efficiently
pumped
merriam
by
the
time
simpson
was
pouring
the
wine
into
glasses
she
and
her
companions
were
in
possession
of
all
the
substantial
facts
of
his
brief
biography
and
had
guessed
the
secret
of
his
heart
they
knew
of
his
boyhood
on
the
farm
of
his
father
s
death
and
his
mother
s
a
few
years
later
of
his
college
days
with
something
of
their
athletic
dramatic
and
fraternity
incidents
of
his
teaching
at
riceville
of
the
riceville
football
and
teams
of
the
occasion
for
this
trip
to
chicago
and
of
mollie
june
at
length
the
sherbet
glasses
were
removed
and
some
of
the
coffees
including
merriam
s
refilled
and
they
all
lit
cigarettes
merriam
was
pleasantly
startled
when
alicia
too
took
a
cigarette
he
had
read
of
course
of
women
smoking
but
he
had
never
seen
it
or
expected
to
see
it
with
his
own
eyes
except
on
the
stage
it
was
more
shocking
to
his
secret
soul
than
any
amount
of
bosom
and
back
you
need
not
wait
simpson
said
alicia
we
ll
ring
if
we
need
you
again
when
the
waiter
had
withdrawn
philip
rockwell
took
the
center
of
the
stage
he
tilted
back
in
his
chair
and
abruptly
began
to
talk
part
of
the
time
he
looked
straight
ahead
of
him
as
if
addressing
an
audience
but
now
and
again
he
turned
his
head
and
aimed
his
discourse
straight
at
merriam
he
made
only
a
pretence
of
smoking
merriam
he
said
by
a
curious
chance
a
freak
of
nature
as
it
were
you
who
have
thus
far
taken
no
part
in
the
politics
of
the
state
and
nation
are
in
a
position
to
render
a
great
service
this
very
night
to
the
cause
of
reform
and
incidentally
to
senator
and
mrs
norman
how
so
said
merriam
he
was
rather
on
his
guard
against
philip
rockwell
it
is
a
long
story
perhaps
said
that
gentleman
i
gathered
when
we
were
introduced
that
you
had
heard
of
me
but
i
was
not
sure
how
much
you
have
heard
i
am
at
the
present
time
the
president
of
the
reform
league
of
this
city
and
its
guiding
and
moving
spirit
and
endowed
with
the
superb
modesty
so
characteristic
of
reformers
interjected
alicia
the
reformer
paid
no
attention
to
this
frivolous
parenthesis
miss
wayward
he
continued
alluded
earlier
to
my
sobriquet
the
epithet
was
first
applied
to
me
derisively
by
opposition
newspapers
but
it
is
a
true
description
indeed
it
was
derived
from
my
frequent
use
of
the
phrase
in
my
own
speeches
i
believe
that
to
be
successful
practically
successful
reform
must
center
its
efforts
on
one
thing
at
a
time
not
waste
its
energies
its
munitions
so
to
speak
by
bombarding
the
whole
entrenched
line
of
evil
and
privilege
at
once
but
concentrate
its
fire
on
one
exposed
position
after
another
take
that
one
position
accomplish
finally
one
definite
thing
and
then
go
on
to
some
other
one
definite
thing
do
you
get
me
merriam
signified
that
he
comprehended
father
murray
was
more
enthusiastic
it
is
a
truly
splendid
idea
he
volunteered
since
we
have
adopted
it
under
the
leadership
of
rockwell
the
reform
league
has
really
begun
to
do
things
do
things
he
repeated
with
an
almost
mysterious
emphasis
at
the
present
time
rockwell
resumed
the
one
thing
which
the
reform
league
is
undertaking
to
is
to
secure
decent
traction
conditions
in
this
city
adequate
service
we
have
so
far
succeeded
that
we
have
forced
an
unfriendly
city
council
to
pass
the
new
traction
ordinance
you
are
familiar
with
the
new
ordinance
mr
merriam
yes
said
merriam
by
which
we
must
suppose
he
meant
that
he
had
read
headlines
about
it
in
the
chicago
papers
those
rascals
continued
rockwell
never
would
have
passed
it
the
men
who
own
them
would
never
have
permitted
them
to
pass
it
no
matter
how
unmistakable
the
demand
of
the
people
might
be
if
they
had
not
counted
on
one
thing
merriam
perceived
that
an
interrogation
was
demanded
of
him
and
took
his
cue
what
is
that
he
asked
they
are
counting
said
rockwell
impressively
they
are
counting
on
mayor
black
they
have
believed
the
whole
time
that
he
can
be
depended
on
to
veto
it
and
they
are
right
the
scoundrels
usually
are
the
mayor
as
every
one
knows
is
a
mere
puppet
he
will
do
as
he
is
told
only
the
league
has
made
such
a
stir
the
people
are
so
tremendously
aroused
that
he
is
frightened
and
so
before
acting
before
writing
the
veto
which
he
has
sense
enough
to
see
is
likely
to
mean
political
suicide
he
is
coming
here
to
see
senator
norman
to
get
his
instructions
that
s
what
it
amounts
to
norman
holds
the
state
machine
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
if
norman
tells
him
to
veto
black
will
veto
it
may
be
bad
for
him
with
the
voters
if
he
does
it
but
it
would
be
certain
political
death
for
a
man
like
him
to
cross
norman
norman
will
say
veto
i
see
said
merriam
which
was
hardly
true
he
did
not
as
yet
see
an
inch
ahead
of
his
nose
into
this
thing
but
he
thought
it
sounded
well
where
do
i
come
in
though
he
added
belying
his
assumption
of
sagacity
that
s
my
very
next
point
said
rockwell
his
chair
came
down
on
all
fours
he
squared
it
to
the
table
laid
his
neglected
cigarette
aside
put
his
arms
on
the
cloth
and
looked
very
straight
at
merriam
are
you
aware
merriam
that
you
bear
a
most
striking
physical
resemblance
to
senator
norman
i
have
been
told
so
said
merriam
my
mother
often
spoke
of
it
and
norman
mentioned
it
to
me
before
she
was
married
i
have
seen
his
pictures
of
course
in
the
papers
i
have
never
seen
him
in
person
this
was
true
for
john
merriam
had
quite
inexcusably
stayed
away
from
mollie
june
s
wedding
he
has
never
seen
you
then
he
probably
doesn
t
know
of
my
existence
so
much
the
better
said
rockwell
the
only
difficulty
then
is
norman
and
she
can
be
eliminated
this
facile
elimination
of
mollie
june
did
not
make
an
irresistible
appeal
to
merriam
but
he
held
his
tongue
alicia
wayward
saw
the
reformer
s
mistake
rockwell
means
she
threw
in
that
norman
can
be
shielded
from
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
exactly
said
rockwell
quickly
merriam
he
continued
if
you
have
never
seen
the
senator
with
your
own
eyes
you
can
have
no
realisation
of
the
closeness
of
your
resemblance
to
him
hair
eyes
nose
mouth
size
carriage
manner
movement
it
is
truly
wonderful
and
it
is
the
same
with
your
voice
father
murray
here
says
he
fairly
jumped
when
you
first
spoke
to
him
out
in
the
cabaret
when
he
went
over
to
question
you
he
also
says
interrupted
alicia
as
if
mischievously
that
it
is
providential
please
do
not
be
irreverent
miss
alicia
said
the
priest
it
does
surely
seem
providential
on
this
night
of
all
nights
it
surely
seems
so
well
said
merriam
a
trifle
bluntly
perhaps
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
that
if
my
cousin
and
i
look
so
much
alike
as
you
say
no
doubt
it
s
quite
remarkable
still
such
things
happen
often
enough
in
families
what
of
it
i
have
explained
said
rockwell
with
an
air
of
much
patience
that
mayor
black
is
coming
here
to
this
hotel
to
see
senator
norman
about
the
ordinance
and
that
norman
will
order
him
to
veto
it
we
thought
we
had
norman
fixed
but
he
has
gone
over
to
the
magnates
as
he
always
does
in
the
end
black
will
do
as
he
is
bid
and
it
will
be
a
death
blow
we
can
never
pass
it
over
his
veto
it
means
the
total
ruin
of
five
years
of
work
involving
the
expenditure
of
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
and
the
cause
of
reform
in
this
city
will
be
dead
for
years
to
come
the
league
will
never
survive
if
we
fail
at
this
last
ditch
it
will
collapse
in
short
said
alicia
sweetly
rockwell
himself
will
collapse
rockwell
took
no
heed
of
her
half
an
hour
ago
he
said
i
was
sitting
yonder
in
the
cabaret
dining
with
miss
wayward
and
father
murray
i
was
eating
turtle
soup
and
olives
he
laughed
theatrically
but
i
was
a
desperate
man
i
had
no
hope
no
interest
left
in
life
then
i
looked
up
and
saw
you
at
first
i
mistook
you
for
senator
norman
even
i
who
have
known
the
old
hypocrite
for
a
dozen
years
i
stared
at
you
wondering
whether
i
should
go
over
and
make
one
last
personal
appeal
to
you
to
him
and
then
i
realised
that
you
could
not
be
he
for
i
knew
positively
that
he
was
dining
in
his
room
i
looked
closer
i
saw
that
you
were
really
a
younger
man
not
that
massaged
laced
old
roué
i
stared
on
in
my
amazement
till
miss
wayward
and
father
murray
looked
too
and
miss
wayward
said
why
there
s
senator
norman
by
god
said
i
perhaps
it
is
do
you
see
mr
merriam
no
said
merriam
i
don
t
ah
but
you
will
you
must
said
rockwell
listen
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
is
now
twenty
minutes
past
seven
norman
is
dining
in
his
room
there
is
a
man
with
him
a
crockett
one
of
the
dozen
men
who
own
chicago
he
is
as
much
interested
in
the
ordinance
as
i
am
on
the
other
side
he
is
giving
norman
his
instructions
for
the
senator
is
crockett
s
puppet
of
course
as
much
as
the
mayor
is
norman
s
crockett
will
leave
promptly
at
a
quarter
to
eight
mayor
black
is
due
at
eight
how
do
you
know
these
things
interrupted
merriam
it
is
my
business
to
know
things
said
rockwell
the
fact
is
he
added
i
planned
to
burst
in
on
norman
and
black
at
their
conference
and
threaten
them
in
the
name
of
the
reform
league
it
would
have
done
no
good
but
i
owed
that
much
to
the
league
and
to
yourself
said
alicia
softly
and
to
myself
yes
said
rockwell
infinitesimally
pricked
at
last
but
he
hurried
on
at
ten
minutes
to
eight
merriam
i
will
telephone
norman
i
will
pretend
to
be
old
schubert
the
mayor
s
private
secretary
he
has
a
dry
clipped
voice
that
is
easy
to
imitate
i
will
say
that
the
mayor
is
sick
at
his
house
i
will
imply
that
he
is
drunk
he
often
is
i
will
say
he
is
not
too
sick
to
veto
the
ordinance
before
the
council
meets
at
nine
but
that
he
insists
on
seeing
senator
norman
before
he
does
it
and
asks
that
norman
come
out
to
his
house
i
will
say
that
i
am
sending
a
car
for
him
norman
will
curse
but
he
will
go
he
is
under
orders
too
you
see
at
five
minutes
to
eight
we
will
send
up
word
that
mayor
black
s
car
is
waiting
for
senator
norman
there
will
be
a
car
waiting
the
driver
will
be
simpson
i
can
fix
it
with
the
hotel
people
to
get
him
off
said
alicia
in
response
to
a
look
from
merriam
he
was
a
chauffeur
once
for
a
and
he
will
do
anything
i
ask
him
to
she
added
norman
will
go
down
and
get
into
that
car
he
will
be
driven
not
to
the
mayor
s
house
of
course
but
to
a
certain
flat
where
he
will
be
detained
for
several
hours
very
possibly
all
night
by
force
asked
merriam
rather
sternly
only
by
force
of
the
affections
said
rockwell
suavely
the
flat
belongs
for
the
time
being
to
a
certain
young
woman
a
manicurist
by
profession
who
is
undoubtedly
very
pretty
and
in
whom
norman
takes
an
interest
i
happen
to
know
that
he
pays
the
rent
of
the
flat
rockwell
paused
but
merriam
made
no
reply
he
blushed
subcutaneously
at
any
rate
for
alicia
and
father
murray
the
latter
indeed
affected
inattention
to
this
portion
of
rockwell
s
discourse
but
alicia
wayward
made
no
pretence
of
either
misunderstanding
or
horror
in
merriam
s
mind
a
slight
embarrassment
quickly
gave
place
to
anger
that
george
norman
after
three
years
how
much
sooner
who
could
tell
should
leave
mollie
june
for
a
his
mind
paused
before
a
word
too
ancient
and
too
frank
for
professorial
sensibilities
rockwell
quickly
resumed
as
soon
as
norman
has
gone
i
will
take
you
to
his
room
we
will
put
his
famous
crimson
smoking
jacket
on
you
and
establish
you
in
his
big
armchair
with
a
cigar
and
some
whiskey
and
soda
beside
you
when
black
comes
he
will
find
senator
norman
you
all
you
will
have
to
do
is
to
be
curt
and
sulky
damn
him
a
bit
and
tell
him
to
sign
the
ordinance
he
ll
never
suspect
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
doesn
t
know
the
senator
well
never
spoke
with
him
privately
above
three
times
in
his
life
we
ll
have
only
side
lights
on
he
won
t
stay
he
ll
be
mightily
relieved
about
the
ordinance
and
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
then
you
yourself
can
get
away
and
catch
your
train
for
for
riceville
supplied
alicia
that
will
be
a
real
adventure
for
you
young
man
and
you
will
have
saved
the
cause
of
reform
in
the
city
of
chicago
john
merriam
smiled
frostily
the
reasons
then
rockwell
why
i
should
fraudulently
impersonate
a
senator
of
the
united
states
who
happens
to
be
my
cousin
and
in
his
name
act
in
an
important
matter
directly
contrary
to
his
own
wishes
are
for
the
fun
of
the
adventure
and
to
save
your
reform
league
from
a
setback
is
that
correct
philip
said
alicia
quickly
you
and
father
murray
go
for
a
walk
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
merriam
alone
come
back
in
twenty
minutes
the
implication
of
her
last
phrase
was
distinctly
flattering
to
merriam
if
he
had
understood
it
alicia
wayward
would
not
have
asked
for
more
than
ten
minutes
with
most
men
rockwell
smiled
with
lowered
eyelids
a
smile
which
it
was
certainly
a
mistake
for
him
to
permit
himself
for
it
could
not
and
did
not
fail
to
put
merriam
on
his
guard
against
alicia
come
murray
said
rockwell
rising
i
should
like
a
breath
of
real
air
shouldn
t
you
and
when
miss
wayward
commands
he
waved
his
hand
grandly
au
revoir
and
he
and
the
priest
hastily
departed
and
the
motives
of
take
another
cigarette
won
t
you
mr
merriam
said
alicia
as
the
curtain
at
the
door
fell
behind
rockwell
and
father
murray
thank
you
said
merriam
he
was
excited
of
course
all
the
stimulations
of
his
evening
including
more
coffee
than
he
was
used
to
and
an
unaccustomed
taste
of
wine
and
mystery
and
intrigue
could
not
fail
to
tell
on
the
blood
of
youth
but
he
felt
extraordinarily
calm
and
he
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
alicia
he
had
not
fully
made
up
his
mind
about
the
proposed
adventure
but
alicia
knew
several
things
about
the
wantings
of
men
let
me
light
it
for
you
she
pursued
she
struck
a
match
which
somehow
she
already
had
out
of
its
box
put
out
a
white
hand
and
arm
took
the
cigarette
from
his
fingers
put
it
to
her
own
lips
and
lighted
it
and
handed
it
back
to
him
thank
you
said
merriam
again
just
a
little
confused
hesitatingly
with
an
undeniable
trace
of
thrill
he
put
the
cigarette
to
his
own
lips
poor
boy
it
was
an
uneven
contest
alicia
deftly
moved
her
chair
to
the
corner
of
the
table
bringing
it
not
very
close
but
much
closer
to
merriam
s
close
enough
for
him
to
catch
the
faint
unfamiliar
perfume
she
put
out
her
hand
again
and
drew
one
of
the
yellow
roses
from
their
bowl
she
rested
both
arms
on
the
table
and
played
with
the
rose
drawing
it
through
her
fingers
and
up
and
down
one
white
rounded
forearm
merriam
she
said
perhaps
you
have
wondered
why
i
am
in
this
thing
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
neglected
to
be
curious
on
that
point
but
now
he
was
yes
he
said
rockwell
converted
me
oh
i
can
see
you
don
t
like
him
you
think
he
is
hard
and
unscrupulous
and
well
he
is
all
men
are
at
least
almost
all
men
are
she
glanced
at
merriam
but
he
is
a
genuine
reformer
for
all
that
he
is
heart
and
soul
for
what
he
calls
the
people
he
works
tremendously
for
them
all
his
time
and
he
is
shrewd
and
fearless
now
it
is
probable
that
alicia
s
little
character
sketch
presented
a
very
just
picture
of
philip
rockwell
but
it
did
not
appeal
to
merriam
as
true
much
less
as
likable
he
was
too
young
he
still
wanted
his
heroes
all
heroic
and
his
villains
naught
but
black
and
red
with
almost
visible
horns
and
tail
he
did
not
reply
he
could
not
however
remove
his
eyes
from
the
felicitous
meanderings
of
the
yellow
rose
well
sighed
alicia
i
was
going
to
tell
you
how
rockwell
converted
me
you
see
my
father
but
you
don
t
know
who
my
father
is
do
you
the
newspapers
always
refer
to
him
us
the
billionaire
they
like
the
alliteration
i
suppose
he
s
very
busy
now
converting
all
his
plants
for
the
manufacture
of
she
laughed
as
if
that
were
a
good
joke
his
youngest
sister
my
aunt
geraldine
was
senator
norman
s
first
wife
so
i
know
george
norman
well
i
was
quite
a
favourite
of
his
when
he
used
to
come
to
our
house
before
poor
aunt
jerry
died
so
philip
wanted
me
to
use
my
influence
with
norman
about
his
precious
ordinance
i
wasn
t
much
interested
at
first
i
hadn
t
ridden
in
a
street
car
of
course
in
years
hadn
t
you
said
merriam
quite
at
a
loss
no
when
i
go
out
i
take
either
the
limousine
or
the
electric
so
i
really
didn
t
know
much
about
conditions
except
of
course
from
the
cartoons
about
in
the
newspapers
philip
saw
that
that
was
why
i
was
unsympathetic
so
he
dared
me
to
go
for
a
ride
with
him
of
course
i
wouldn
t
take
a
dare
it
was
about
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
we
took
the
limousine
down
to
wabash
and
madison
there
philip
made
me
get
out
on
the
street
corner
it
was
horrid
weather
a
cold
blowy
spring
rain
but
philip
was
hard
as
a
rock
he
told
the
chauffeur
to
drive
to
the
corner
of
cottage
grove
and
street
and
wait
for
us
and
waited
for
a
car
it
was
terrible
we
stood
out
in
the
street
under
the
elevated
by
one
of
the
posts
you
know
for
a
little
protection
from
the
train
we
hadn
t
any
umbrella
the
wind
tore
at
my
skirts
and
my
hair
the
trains
going
by
overhead
nearly
burst
your
ears
with
noise
and
automobiles
and
great
motor
trucks
crashed
past
within
a
few
inches
of
us
and
splashed
mud
and
nearly
stifled
us
with
gasoline
smells
and
a
crowd
of
other
people
got
around
us
and
knocked
into
us
and
walked
on
our
feet
and
stuck
umbrellas
in
our
eyes
for
a
long
time
no
car
at
all
came
then
three
or
four
came
together
but
they
were
all
jammed
full
to
the
steps
so
that
we
couldn
t
get
on
i
was
ready
to
give
up
i
told
philip
so
let
s
go
into
mandel
s
i
begged
and
you
can
call
a
no
you
don
t
he
said
here
we
can
get
on
this
another
car
had
stopped
about
twenty
feet
from
us
we
joined
a
kind
of
football
rush
for
the
rear
end
i
tripped
on
my
skirt
when
i
tried
to
climb
the
steps
but
philip
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
dragged
me
on
as
though
i
had
been
a
sack
of
flour
then
for
a
long
time
we
couldn
t
get
inside
but
had
to
stand
on
the
platform
wedged
like
olives
in
a
bottle
it
was
so
dark
and
cold
and
noisy
and
everybody
was
so
wet
and
crushed
and
smelly
a
man
beside
me
smelled
so
strong
of
tobacco
and
whiskey
and
of
not
having
had
a
bath
for
a
long
time
that
i
was
nearly
and
i
thought
a
poor
little
shop
girl
on
the
other
side
of
me
was
going
to
faint
after
a
long
time
some
people
got
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
car
at
twelfth
street
philip
says
and
some
of
us
squeezed
inside
into
the
crowded
aisle
inside
it
was
warm
hot
in
fact
but
still
smellier
philip
got
me
a
strap
and
i
hung
on
to
it
i
don
t
care
for
jokes
any
more
it
s
terribly
tiring
and
it
pulls
your
waist
all
out
of
shape
bet
you
won
t
get
a
seat
grinned
philip
of
course
i
was
bound
then
that
i
would
i
looked
about
some
of
the
men
who
were
seated
were
reading
papers
the
way
they
are
in
the
cartoons
others
just
sat
and
stared
in
front
of
them
i
didn
t
blame
them
much
they
looked
tired
too
but
i
had
to
get
a
seat
to
spite
philip
the
young
man
in
the
one
before
which
i
was
standing
or
hanging
looked
rather
nice
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
his
seat
i
had
to
look
down
inside
his
newspaper
and
crowd
against
his
legs
at
last
after
looking
up
at
me
three
or
four
times
he
got
up
with
a
jerk
as
if
he
had
just
noticed
me
and
took
off
his
hat
and
i
smiled
at
him
and
at
philip
and
sat
down
but
he
kept
staring
at
me
so
that
i
wished
i
had
let
him
alone
i
made
the
poor
little
shop
girl
sit
on
my
lap
nobody
gave
her
a
seat
i
suppose
she
wouldn
t
work
for
it
the
way
i
did
she
was
a
pretty
little
thing
too
just
a
tiny
bit
like
mollie
june
norman
not
so
pretty
of
course
but
the
same
type
then
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
till
we
got
to
street
ages
and
ages
they
ought
to
have
been
able
to
go
to
the
south
pole
and
back
when
we
did
get
there
i
put
the
little
girl
in
my
seat
she
was
going
to
street
poor
little
thing
and
philip
and
i
got
out
and
went
home
in
the
limousine
and
he
told
me
all
about
how
the
ordinance
would
better
things
and
i
promised
to
help
him
if
i
could
and
you
did
said
merriam
he
was
touched
whether
by
alicia
s
own
sufferings
in
the
course
of
her
remarkable
exploration
or
by
those
of
the
little
shop
girl
who
looked
like
mollie
june
does
not
perhaps
matter
he
now
quite
fully
liked
alicia
he
saw
that
in
spite
of
her
extreme
décolleté
and
her
cigarettes
she
had
a
generous
heart
i
tried
to
replied
alicia
i
saw
george
norman
and
i
did
my
best
my
very
best
but
he
wouldn
t
promise
anything
he
only
laughed
and
tried
to
kiss
me
tried
to
kiss
you
echoed
merriam
naïvely
aghast
yes
said
alicia
with
her
eyes
demurely
on
the
rose
between
her
fingers
and
john
merriam
looking
at
her
grasped
clearly
the
possibility
that
a
boy
senator
with
whom
alicia
had
done
her
very
best
might
try
to
kiss
her
so
that
is
one
reason
why
i
am
in
it
to
the
death
alicia
went
on
because
george
norman
wouldn
t
listen
to
me
and
i
don
t
want
philip
to
fail
she
laid
one
hand
quickly
over
one
of
merriam
s
hands
startling
him
so
that
he
nearly
drew
his
away
i
love
him
she
said
and
her
eyes
shone
effulgently
into
merriam
s
he
hasn
t
much
money
and
he
is
hard
and
and
conceited
but
he
is
courageous
he
dares
anything
he
dared
to
take
me
on
that
ride
he
would
dare
to
burst
in
on
the
senator
and
mayor
black
he
dares
think
up
this
plan
a
woman
loves
a
man
there
is
no
doubt
that
alicia
pronounced
man
with
a
capital
letter
and
she
looked
challengingly
at
merriam
we
are
to
be
married
next
month
she
added
oh
gasped
merriam
his
eyes
staring
in
spite
of
himself
at
her
hand
that
lay
on
his
the
hand
flew
away
as
quickly
as
it
had
alighted
but
he
still
felt
its
soft
coolness
on
his
fingers
as
she
said
of
course
all
this
is
why
am
in
it
not
why
you
should
be
you
can
t
do
it
just
to
please
me
but
you
really
ought
to
think
of
all
those
poor
people
like
the
little
shop
girl
all
the
tired
men
and
women
millions
of
them
philip
says
who
have
to
endure
that
torture
every
night
after
long
days
of
hard
work
it
s
truly
awful
and
it
might
all
be
so
much
better
if
we
only
got
the
ordinance
you
could
get
it
for
them
in
one
little
half
hour
she
looked
hopefully
at
merriam
he
was
in
fact
hesitant
to
have
the
fun
of
the
thing
to
gratify
this
strange
attractive
alicia
and
to
render
an
important
service
to
the
population
of
a
great
city
it
was
tempting
there
s
another
thing
alicia
hurried
on
you
knew
mollie
june
norman
she
was
one
of
your
students
i
think
you
ought
to
do
it
for
her
sake
why
so
merriam
s
question
came
swift
and
sharp
because
if
senator
norman
kills
the
ordinance
it
will
be
his
ruin
it
will
cost
him
chicago
s
vote
in
the
next
election
and
he
can
t
win
on
the
vote
alone
i
thought
rockwell
said
the
league
would
collapse
possibly
alicia
had
forgotten
this
but
she
only
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
may
or
it
mayn
t
but
either
way
the
people
are
aroused
philip
swears
they
will
beat
norman
if
he
betrays
them
now
he
is
sure
they
can
and
will
and
if
the
boy
senator
were
unseated
and
had
to
retire
to
private
life
it
would
be
terrible
for
mollie
june
he
s
bad
enough
to
live
with
as
it
is
at
this
point
merriam
was
visited
by
a
sudden
and
splendid
idea
since
he
did
not
disclose
it
to
alicia
i
feel
in
honour
bound
to
conceal
it
for
the
present
from
the
reader
alicia
detected
its
presence
in
his
eyes
and
judiciously
kept
silent
it
took
about
ten
seconds
for
that
idea
to
grow
from
nothingness
into
full
flower
for
perhaps
five
seconds
longer
merriam
inwardly
contemplated
its
unique
beauty
then
he
said
i
ll
do
it
alicia
gave
him
no
time
for
reconsideration
or
good
she
cried
i
was
sure
you
would
she
was
on
her
feet
in
an
instant
and
as
he
got
to
his
she
held
out
her
hand
merriam
took
it
to
shake
hands
on
their
bargain
was
his
thought
but
alicia
never
exactly
shook
hands
she
touched
or
pressed
or
squeezed
according
to
circumstances
on
this
occasion
it
was
a
warm
clinging
squeeze
her
other
hand
patted
merriam
s
shoulder
i
was
sure
you
would
she
repeated
no
man
again
the
capital
letter
was
unmistakable
could
have
resisted
the
the
opportunity
the
curtain
at
the
door
was
lifted
and
philip
rockwell
s
voice
said
may
i
come
in
the
twenty
minutes
are
up
they
were
just
up
alicia
had
done
her
part
in
exactly
the
fraction
of
an
hour
she
had
given
herself
no
vaudeville
act
could
have
been
more
precisely
timed
yes
come
in
dear
said
alicia
merriam
will
do
it
we
were
just
shaking
hands
on
it
rockwell
crossed
the
room
in
a
rush
and
caught
merriam
s
hand
as
alicia
relinquished
it
he
pumped
vigorously
in
his
eyes
shone
the
unmistakable
light
of
that
genuine
enthusiasm
which
alicia
had
described
to
her
skeptical
auditor
you
re
the
right
sort
he
cried
you
are
doing
a
great
thing
merriam
you
will
never
regret
it
but
i
can
t
thank
you
now
he
added
dropping
merriam
s
hand
in
so
to
speak
it
s
ten
minutes
of
eight
that
crockett
came
out
of
the
elevator
just
before
i
came
back
i
have
a
car
at
the
ladies
entrance
with
simpson
asked
alicia
yes
i
had
to
get
things
ready
the
time
was
so
short
i
fixed
the
head
waiter
simpson
seemed
ready
enough

some
old
grudge
against
norman
i
think
yes
said
alicia
he
has
i
m
a
little
afraid
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
him
never
mind
it
can
t
be
helped
where
s
father
murray
watching
to
buttonhole
the
mayor
if
he
should
come
too
soon
he
looked
critically
for
a
moment
at
merriam
seemed
satisfied
and
crossed
to
the
telephone
on
the
sideboard
i
ll
ring
up
the
curtain
he
said
he
laughed
boyishly
in
his
excitement
and
new
hope
he
seemed
very
different
now
from
the
fellow
of
an
hour
ago
merriam
saw
how
alicia
might
admire
him
give
me
room
he
said
into
the
telephone
his
eyes
smiling
at
them
a
moment
later
a
harsh
dry
old
man
s
voice
was
saying
is
this
senator
norman
this
is
schubert
private
secretary
to
mayor
black
the
mayor
is
i
can
t
help
it
sir

s
sick
all
right
he
s
out
here
at
his
yes
he
can
veto
the
ordinance
all
right
if
it
s
necessary
but
he
won
t
do
it
without
seeing
you
first
he
wants
you
to
come
out
he
s
sent
a
car
for
you
it
ought
to
be
down
there
at
the
ladies
entrance
by
no
it
won
t
do
any
good
to
call
him
up
i
m
here
at
his
house
now
he
s
in
bed
and
he
won
t
veto
unless
he
sees
you
really
sir
if
you
ll
pardon
me
you
d
better
thank
you
sir
rockwell
clicked
the
receiver
triumphantly
into
its
hook
that
s
done
he
said
alicia
dear
go
up
to
the
lobby
on
the
women
s
side
and
watch
the
hallway
leading
to
the
ladies
entrance
norman
should
pass
out
that
way
within
five
minutes
follow
him
far
enough
to
make
sure
that
simpson
gets
him
and
then
let
us
know
meanwhile
i
ll
coach
merriam
a
little
right
said
alicia
she
moved
to
the
door
the
eyes
of
both
men
followed
her
when
alicia
moved
the
eyes
of
men
did
follow
and
she
knew
it
at
the
doorway
she
turned
and
blew
a
kiss
which
might
be
said
to
fall
with
gracious
impartiality
between
her
lover
and
the
younger
man
it
was
a
pretty
exit
she
s
a
splendid
girl
said
rockwell
his
eyes
lingering
on
the
curtain
that
had
cut
her
off
from
them
yes
said
merriam
rockwell
still
by
the
sideboard
reached
for
the
long
bottle
have
another
glass
of
this
i
don
t
mind
said
merriam
the
fact
is
a
bit
of
stage
fright
had
come
in
for
him
when
alicia
went
out
there
s
not
much
i
can
tell
you
rockwell
said
as
he
poured
out
the
yellow
fluid
you
ll
have
to
depend
mostly
on
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
you
look
the
part
all
right
your
voice
is
all
right
too
act
as
grumpy
as
you
like
damn
him
about
a
you
can
swear
he
asked
hastily
a
sudden
horrible
doubt
of
pedagogical
capabilities
had
crossed
his
mind
now
merriam
was
not
a
profane
man
but
some
of
his
fraternity
brethren
had
been
also
he
remembered
the
vituperative
exploits
of
his
football
coach
between
halves
when
the
game
was
going
badly
swear
he
cried
as
harshly
as
possible
of
course
i
can
swear
you
damn
fool
for
three
seconds
rockwell
was
startled
then
he
laughed
fine
he
cried
you
ll
do
it
all
there
is
to
it
really
is
to
tell
him
to
sign
the
ordinance
and
to
get
out
he
may
ask
about
crockett
if
he
wants
to
know
why
he
s
changed
his
mind
tell
him
it
s
none
of
his
damn
business
if
he
refers
to
a
madame
couteau
you
must
look
pleased
she
s
the
pretty
little
manicurist
whom
norman
will
be
on
his
way
to
visit
black
knows
of
that
affair
and
he
knows
norman
likes
to
talk
about
it
so
he
may
drag
it
in
with
the
idea
of
getting
on
your
blind
side
you
can
tell
him
to
shut
up
of
course
but
you
must
act
gratified
yes
said
merriam
in
a
noncommittal
tone
but
rockwell
did
not
notice
he
was
sipping
the
benedictine
with
his
mind
on
his
problem
that
s
all
i
can
think
of
he
said
in
a
moment
i
ll
be
in
the
next
room
the
bedroom
of
the
suite
you
know
and
if
you
should
get
into
deep
water
i
ll
burst
in
just
as
i
meant
to
on
the
real
senator
and
pull
you
out
we
ought
to
get
it
over
in
fifteen
minutes
at
the
outside
and
get
you
off
there
s
just
the
least
chance
in
the
world
of
course
that
senator
norman
might
get
away
from
simpson
and
come
back
and
there
s
mrs
norman
where
will
she
be
asked
merriam
as
he
took
a
rather
large
sip
of
his
cordial
she
s
in
the
lobby
now
with
miss
norman
the
senator
s
sister
you
know
listening
to
the
orchestra
merriam
vaguely
recalled
the
elderly
woman
whom
he
had
seen
with
mollie
june
in
the
cabaret
the
senator
was
going
to
take
them
to
the
theater
after
he
had
finished
with
black
what
will
they
do
when
he
doesn
t
show
up
merriam
inquired
but
to
all
appearances
he
was
chiefly
interested
at
the
moment
in
the
best
of
liqueurs
probably
go
without
him
she
s
used
to
george
norman
s
broken
engagements
by
now
i
see
said
merriam
without
expression
alicia
and
murray
will
keep
an
eye
on
them
of
course
rockwell
added
and
then
both
men
jumped
it
was
only
the
telephone
but
conspiracy
makes
neurasthenics
of
us
all
rockwell
answered
it
that
s
all
oh
yes
we
ll
go
at
once
he
turned
excitedly
to
merriam
it
s
alicia
norman
has
come
down
and
got
into
simpson
s
car
norman
is
still
in
the
lobby
and
the
mayor
has
come
in
murray
s
got
him
but
he
won
t
be
able
to
hold
him
long
we
must
go
right
up
to
the
room
come
senator
merriam
followed
out
of
the
private
and
down
the
corridor
at
a
great
pace
into
a
main
hallway
and
to
an
elevator
several
people
looked
hard
at
merriam
one
elderly
man
stopped
and
held
out
his
hand
how
are
you
senator
but
rockwell
crowded
rudely
between
them
excuse
me
colonel
but
we
must
catch
this
very
urgent
he
called
as
the
door
clicked
and
merriam
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
add
look
you
up
later
good
rockwell
began
as
they
stopped
at
the
main
floor
but
he
paused
on
the
first
word
with
his
mouth
open
a
very
large
man
large
every
way
in
evening
clothes
with
a
fine
head
of
white
hair
and
an
air
of
conscious
distinction
was
stepping
into
the
car
he
saw
merriam
and
rockwell
then
instantly
he
appeared
not
to
have
observed
them
hesitated
backed
gracefully
out
of
the
little
group
that
was
entering
the
elevator
and
was
gone
the
car
smoothly
ascended
three
said
rockwell
to
the
elevator
man
then
to
merriam
he
whispered
that
was
the
mayor
he
s
got
away
from
murray
ask
for
your
key
whispered
rockwell
as
they
stepped
out
for
five
protracted
steps
merriam
s
mind
struggled
frantically
after
the
room
number
he
had
just
grasped
it
when
he
perceived
that
his
perturbation
had
been
unnecessary
for
the
floor
clerk
a
pretty
blonde
of
about
thirty
was
looking
at
him
with
her
sunniest
smile
your
key
senator
yes
please
he
managed
to
say
as
she
handed
him
the
key
her
fingers
lightly
touched
his
for
a
second
and
she
said
in
a
low
tone
the
violets
are
lovely
he
saw
that
she
was
wearing
a
large
bunch
of
those
expensively
modest
flowers
at
her
waist
and
understood
that
his
cousin
s
interests
might
not
be
limited
to
madame
couteau
he
lingered
just
a
moment
and
replied
in
a
tone
as
low
as
her
own
they
look
lovely
where
they
are
now
but
an
appalling
difficulty
loomed
over
him
even
as
he
murmured
for
he
did
not
know
whether
room
lay
to
the
right
or
the
left
and
if
he
should
start
in
the
wrong
direction
but
rockwell
knew
and
was
already
moving
to
the
left
merriam
followed
in
his
relief
he
smiled
brightly
back
at
the
floor
clerk
at
the
corner
where
the
hall
turned
rockwell
stopped
and
merriam
coming
up
with
him
read
on
the
door
before
them
both
men
looked
up
at
the
transom
it
was
dark
in
said
rockwell
merriam
inserted
the
key
turned
it
and
cautiously
opened
the
door
a
couple
of
inches
becoming
as
he
did
so
thrillingly
conscious
of
the
burglarious
quality
of
their
enterprise
no
light
or
sound
came
from
within
for
only
three
or
four
seconds
rockwell
listened
then
he
pushed
the
door
wide
stepped
past
merriam
and
felt
for
the
switch
you
haven
t
invited
me
in
senator
he
said
as
the
room
went
alight
but
i
m
a
forward
sort
of
come
inside
and
close
the
door
he
added
merriam
pushed
the
door
shut
behind
him
and
stared
about
the
apartment
was
probably
the
most
gorgeous
he
had
ever
seen
the
walls
were
a
soft
cream
colour
the
woodwork
white
the
carpet
and
hangings
and
lampshades
rose
most
of
the
furniture
was
mahogany
some
of
it
upholstered
in
tapestry
on
a
table
half
way
down
one
side
of
the
room
stood
a
bowl
of
red
roses
in
the
wall
opposite
merriam
between
the
windows
was
a
fireplace
of
white
marble
containing
a
gas
log
with
a
large
mirror
above
the
mantel
in
a
frame
of
white
and
gold
before
this
fireplace
stood
a
huge
upholstered
easy
chair
with
a
floor
lamp
on
one
side
of
it
and
a
small
mahogany
tabaret
on
the
other
while
merriam
was
endeavouring
to
appreciate
this
magnificence
rockwell
quickly
crossed
the
sitting
room
and
passed
through
a
door
at
one
side
after
a
moment
he
returned
crossed
the
room
again
and
disappeared
through
a
second
door
reëmerging
he
announced
triumphantly
no
one
in
the
bedrooms
but
merriam
s
eyes
rested
fascinated
on
a
garment
which
rockwell
had
brought
back
with
him
from
the
second
bedroom
a
luxurious
smoking
jacket
of
a
most
lurid
crimson
colour
which
clashed
outrageously
with
the
rose
and
pinks
of
the
senatorial
sitting
room
rockwell
grinned
at
the
look
on
merriam
s
face
a
historic
garment
sir
he
declared
the
boy
senator
s
crimson
smoking
jacket
is
a
household
word
with
most
of
the
six
million
souls
of
this
commonwealth
of
illinois
off
with
your
tails
sir
and
into
it
hurry
he
cried
as
merriam
hesitated
the
mayor
will
be
here
any
minute
why
didn
t
he
come
up
in
the
elevator
with
us
merriam
asked
while
changing
all
because
of
me
sir
replied
rockwell
in
excellent
spirits
the
mayor
abhors
me
and
all
my
works
so
sincerely
that
i
feel
i
have
not
lived
in
now
then
sit
in
that
big
chair
before
the
fireplace
here
light
this
cigar
i
ll
start
the
gas
log
going
and
bring
in
the
tray
with
the
siphon
and
glasses
and
rye
that
i
saw
in
the
other
ah
the
telephone
had
rung
and
merriam
had
leapt
out
of
his
chair
answer
it
said
rockwell
merriam
stepped
to
the
telephone
which
was
on
the
wall
laid
down
his
cigar
gripped
his
nerve
hard
and
put
the
receiver
to
his
ear
hello
a
deep
voice
boomingly
suave
replied
senator
norman
yes
this
is
black
have
you
got
rid
of
rockwell
yet
no
not
yet
well
can
t
you
throw
him
out
i
am
due
at
the
council
meeting
at
nine
of
course
and
i
don
t
care
to
discuss
matters
with
you
in
his
presence
naturally
when
shall
i
come
up
now
the
mayor
s
rather
long
speech
had
given
merriam
time
to
think
he
recalled
his
great
idea
and
a
new
inspiration
as
to
ways
and
means
came
to
him
he
replied
curtly
but
good
god
cried
the
mayor
that
gives
us
so
little
time
can
t
you
i
said
damn
you
and
merriam
hung
up
and
turned
to
face
rockwell
at
his
elbow
but
why
demanded
the
latter
as
soon
as
he
understood
that
it
had
been
the
mayor
man
alive
we
ought
to
be
gone
by
then
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
next
twenty
minutes
you
must
have
lost
your
head
call
him
again
call
the
desk
and
have
him
paged
and
told
to
come
right
up
without
a
word
merriam
turned
to
the
telephone
again
and
asked
for
the
desk
but
a
moment
later
he
gave
philip
rockwell
one
of
the
major
surprises
of
the
latter
s
life
for
what
he
said
was
please
page
george
norman
with
the
message
that
senator
norman
would
like
to
see
her
right
away
in
their
rooms
repeat
that
that
s
right
thank
you
what
in
hell
cried
rockwell
belatedly
released
by
the
click
of
the
receiver
from
a
paralysis
of
astonishment
merriam
picked
up
his
cigar
walked
back
to
the
easy
chair
and
seated
himself
comfortably
he
was
excited
now
to
the
point
of
a
quite
theatrical
composure
nothing
in
hell
he
said
quite
the
contrary
in
fact
i
want
to
have
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
norman
that
s
all
see
here
said
rockwell
what
funny
business
is
this
i
won
t
have
won
t
you
all
right
just
as
you
say
if
you
don
t
like
the
way
i
m
playing
my
part
i
ll
drop
it
and
walk
right
out
of
that
door
i
have
a
ticket
for
the
theater
i
can
still
be
in
time
the
other
man
stared
and
gulped
it
was
hard
for
him
to
realise
that
this
young
cub
was
master
of
the
situation
and
not
he
rockwell
but
this
is
serious
he
cried
the
ordinance
the
reform
league
the
whole
city
of
chicago
you
can
t
risk
these
for
he
stopped
then
do
you
realise
you
young
fool
that
if
we
re
caught
in
this
room
it
will
mean
jail
for
both
of
us
but
merriam
in
his
present
mood
was
incapable
of
realising
anything
of
the
sort
in
his
mind
s
eye
he
saw
mollie
june
stepping
into
the
elevator
and
saving
in
a
voice
of
heavenly
sweetness
to
the
happy
elevator
man
three
please
an
outer
crust
of
his
consciousness
made
pert
reply
to
rockwell
that
would
be
bad
for
the
reform
league
wouldn
t
it
and
added
but
you
re
willing
to
risk
it
for
the
ordinance
yes
i
am
began
rockwell
but
would
you
risk
it
for
alicia
merriam
interrupted
what
has
alicia
got
to
do
with
it
but
he
understood
and
knew
that
argument
was
useless
and
stared
in
helpless
anger
and
alarm
while
the
younger
man
carefully
grandly
blew
a
beautifully
perfect
smoke
ring
into
the
air
it
was
the
youngster
who
spoke
still
theatrically
calm
you
d
better
go
into
the
bedroom
she
ll
be
here
in
a
moment
shut
the
door
please
and
keep
away
from
it
it
was
one
of
the
secrets
of
philip
rockwell
s
success
in
politics
that
masterful
as
he
was
he
knew
when
to
yield
he
took
a
step
towards
one
of
the
bedrooms
make
it
short
he
pleaded
said
merriam
a
gentle
knocking
sounded
at
the
door
merriam
was
on
his
feet
without
volition
of
his
own
while
rockwell
almost
as
instinctively
slipped
into
the
bedroom
then
the
younger
man
recovered
himself
sat
down
his
feet
to
the
gas
log
and
his
back
to
the
door
and
called
come
in
and
the
door
was
opened
and
closed
john
merriam
s
straining
ears
could
catch
no
definite
sound
of
footsteps
or
skirts
and
he
did
not
dare
to
look
around
yet
by
some
sixth
sense
it
seemed
he
was
aware
of
mollie
june
s
progress
half
way
across
the
room
and
aware
that
she
had
stopped
some
feet
away
from
him
what
is
it
george
she
asked
it
was
only
too
clear
that
mollie
june
s
lord
and
master
was
not
in
the
habit
of
sending
for
her
where
is
miss
norman
merriam
was
conscious
that
senator
norman
probably
did
not
refer
to
his
sister
in
that
fashion
but
he
did
not
know
her
given
name
aunt
mary
i
left
her
in
the
lobby
did
you
want
her
too
there
was
a
note
of
eagerness
in
the
question
no
silence
mollie
june
stood
waiting
in
the
center
of
the
room
the
significance
of
her
failure
to
approach
her
husband
was
unmistakable
then
he
said
would
you
very
much
mind
if
you
should
miss
the
theater
why
no
is
there
anything
the
matter
george
not
for
me
said
merriam
and
he
rose
and
faced
her
i
was
afraid
she
stopped
looked
hard
george
you
look
oh
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
it
was
a
stage
gesture
but
when
stage
situations
occur
in
real
life
the
conventional
business
of
the
boards
is
often
justified
she
looked
again
mr
merriam
john
merriam
stepped
quickly
forward
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
might
faint
he
had
read
many
novels
but
mollie
june
did
nothing
of
the
sort
mr
merriam
she
cried
again
how
do
you
come
here
where
is
norman
how
did
you
get
in
she
pointed
to
the
famous
smoking
jacket
her
bewilderment
was
increasing
she
looked
nervously
about
as
if
suspecting
that
merriam
for
the
sake
of
the
crimson
garment
had
murdered
her
husband
and
concealed
his
body
merriam
had
stopped
almost
he
might
have
wished
that
she
had
fainted
it
would
have
been
delicious
to
carry
her
in
his
arms
and
place
her
in
the
senator
s
easy
chair
and
bring
water
and
when
her
eyes
opened
wonderingly
upon
him
softly
whisper
her
name
as
it
was
he
could
only
say
formally
let
me
take
your
cloak
norman
won
t
you
and
sit
down
mechanically
she
let
him
take
the
opera
cloak
from
her
shoulders
and
when
he
caught
hold
of
the
senatorial
chair
and
swung
it
around
and
pushed
it
towards
her
she
sat
tremblingly
erect
on
the
edge
of
it
her
eyes
dwelt
upon
his
face
as
if
fascinated
isn
t
it
funny
you
look
so
alike
i
never
realised
it
so
much
but
where
is
why
merriam
caught
up
a
small
chair
placed
it
in
front
of
hers
and
sat
down
listen
mollie
june
he
said
pleadingly
using
unconsciously
the
name
that
ran
in
his
thoughts
his
plan
as
it
had
taken
shape
while
he
talked
with
mayor
black
on
the
telephone
was
to
tell
her
in
advance
of
rockwell
s
plot
and
to
carry
it
through
only
with
her
approval
or
consent
for
was
not
his
first
loyalty
to
her
his
original
idea
and
his
real
motive
of
course
had
been
only
to
see
her
and
now
that
he
had
her
there
he
found
he
hated
to
waste
time
on
explanations
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
she
could
not
be
at
ease
or
clear
in
her
mind
until
she
understood
so
rapidly
and
candidly
he
related
how
at
the
instance
of
rockwell
the
senator
had
been
decoyed
away
while
he
was
there
to
impersonate
him
with
mayor
black
so
that
the
latter
should
sign
instead
of
vetoing
the
traction
ordinance
then
he
waited
for
he
knew
not
what
amazement
fright
anger
dissuasion
but
mollie
june
did
not
seem
much
interested
in
traction
ordinances
presumably
senator
norman
had
not
cared
to
educate
his
young
wife
about
political
matters
why
did
you
send
for
she
asked
her
question
was
almost
too
direct
for
him
he
could
not
say
to
ask
her
approval
of
the
plan
against
her
husband
i
had
to
see
you
was
all
he
could
reply
why
but
she
knew
the
real
reason
the
turning
of
her
eyes
away
from
him
confessed
it
it
was
his
chance
to
say
because
i
love
you
an
older
man
might
have
said
it
but
the
young
are
timid
and
conventional
not
bold
and
reckless
as
is
alleged
he
remembered
that
she
was
another
man
s
wife
and
only
spoke
her
name
mollie
june
perhaps
that
did
as
well
in
fact
it
was
in
the
reticent
dialect
of
youth
the
same
thing
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
then
quickly
away
again
you
never
called
me
that
but
once
before
she
said
at
first
he
found
no
answer
his
mind
scarcely
sought
one
he
was
absorbed
in
merely
looking
at
her
she
was
indeed
girlishly
perfect
as
she
sat
there
almost
primly
upright
in
her
white
frock
her
slender
figure
framed
in
the
tapestry
of
the
big
chair
s
back
and
arms
which
gave
an
effect
as
of
a
blush
to
her
cheeks
and
to
the
white
shoulders
which
he
had
never
seen
before
except
across
the
spaces
of
the
peacock
cabaret
to
the
eyes
of
middle
age
she
would
have
been
perhaps
merely
charming
in
his
she
shone
with
the
divine
radiance
of
aphrodite
and
his
were
right
of
course
he
was
almost
trembling
when
at
length
he
said
that
was
on
that
last
night
yes
said
aphrodite
who
is
always
chary
of
speech
suddenly
he
saw
that
her
averted
face
was
wistful
sad
are
you
happy
mollie
june
he
cried
though
she
turned
only
partly
to
him
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
more
a
woman
s
eyes
than
he
had
known
them
and
were
full
of
tears
not
very
she
said
he
sat
dumbly
on
his
chair
full
of
pain
for
her
yet
not
altogether
saddened
that
she
should
not
be
entirely
happy
with
another
man
but
now
her
face
was
fully
towards
him
and
her
eyes
had
become
dry
and
looked
past
him
oh
merriam
you
don
t
know
i
can
t
tell
you
he
was
filled
with
horror
almost
boyishly
terrified
by
such
dim
visions
as
a
man
may
have
of
what
her
lot
might
be
if
i
could
only
help
you
he
cried
as
earnestly
as
all
the
other
separated
lovers
in
the
world
have
said
those
very
words
the
eyes
that
looked
beyond
him
came
back
to
his
face
the
mollie
june
whom
he
had
known
had
had
her
girlish
poise
and
this
more
tragic
mollie
june
did
not
lose
her
for
long
you
helped
me
merriam
oh
i
am
glad
you
brought
me
here
when
i
saw
you
in
the
cabaret
i
just
ran
away
from
you
i
couldn
t
even
let
you
speak
to
me
afterwards
i
waited
upstairs
in
the
lobby
i
thought
i
might
see
you
there
but
you
didn
t
come
then
i
thought
george
had
sent
for
me
she
stopped
as
if
that
was
a
climax
merriam
leaned
forward
he
wanted
to
put
his
hand
over
one
of
hers
that
lay
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
but
did
not
dare
to
his
tongue
however
was
released
at
last
if
ever
i
can
help
you
in
any
way
mollie
june
you
must
let
me
know
i
would
do
anything
for
you
i
will
always
be
ready
he
paused
abruptly
though
only
for
a
second
a
dark
thought
had
crossed
his
mind
after
all
the
boy
senator
was
an
old
man
from
the
standpoint
of
and
leading
a
life
unhealthy
for
old
men
he
hurried
on
i
will
wait
for
you
always
perhaps
some
day
did
she
comprehend
his
meaning
he
could
not
tell
and
he
did
not
know
whether
to
hope
she
did
or
did
not
but
stress
of
conflicting
emotions
made
him
venturesome
he
did
put
his
hand
over
hers
hers
did
not
move
his
fingers
slipped
under
hers
ready
to
raise
her
hand
that
last
night
in
riceville
mollie
june
i
kissed
your
glove
i
want
to
kiss
your
hand
to
make
me
yours
if
you
should
need
me
she
did
not
draw
her
hand
away
but
she
said
you
oughtn
t
to
now
mr
merriam
the
formal
name
by
which
she
had
continually
addressed
him
pricked
won
t
you
call
me
john
mollie
june
just
for
this
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
mayor
comes
oh
the
mayor
she
cried
in
alarmed
remembrance
call
me
john
dear
for
fifteen
minutes
in
his
voice
and
eyes
were
both
entreaty
and
command
and
mollie
june
could
not
resist
them
john
she
whispered
and
he
raised
her
hand
and
bent
quickly
forward
and
his
lips
pressed
her
fingers
a
bare
second
yet
it
was
in
his
mind
a
solemn
a
sacramental
kiss
he
straightened
up
triumphant
happy
youth
asks
so
little
now
you
know
you
have
a
right
to
me
he
cried
to
send
for
me
to
use
me
any
way
any
time
there
came
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
mollie
june
started
half
way
out
of
the
chair
and
then
sank
back
merriam
on
his
feet
and
part
way
across
the
floor
stopped
confused
he
perceived
that
he
ought
to
get
mollie
june
out
of
the
room
the
knocking
resounded
again
and
immediately
the
door
was
tried
and
opened
and
a
man
stepped
in
it
was
the
large
man
with
the
white
hair
who
had
started
to
enter
the
elevator
mayor
black
with
mayor
mayor
of
the
great
city
of
chicago
was
hurriedly
apologetic
i
beg
your
pardon
senator
you
said
you
know
and
it
s
that
now
i
came
up
and
knocked
evidently
you
did
not
hear
a
man
i
met
in
the
lobby
told
me
that
you
had
left
the
hotel
in
a
taxi
half
an
hour
ago
he
said
he
saw
you
go
so
i
tried
the
door
and
when
it
opened
stepped
in
just
to
make
sure
i
am
sorry
to
have
intruded
apparently
however
he
did
not
intend
to
withdraw
mollie
june
crouched
frightened
in
her
chair
but
merriam
was
rapidly
pulling
himself
together
it
is
i
who
should
apologise
for
keeping
you
waiting
mayor
black
he
said
i
will
ask
norman
to
excuse
us
will
you
step
into
the
next
room
for
a
few
minutes
mollie
june
we
shall
not
be
long
he
went
back
to
her
chair
and
held
out
his
hand
she
took
it
and
rose
her
spirit
too
was
reasserting
itself
she
faced
the
mayor
with
a
smile
good
evening
mr
black
good
evening
mrs
norman
he
bowed
gallantly
i
am
very
sorry
oh
she
cried
lightly
one
would
have
said
happily
business
is
business
i
know
then
to
merriam
you
won
t
belong
only
a
minute
dear
perhaps
we
can
hardly
blame
him
for
profiting
by
the
license
his
rôle
gave
him
to
address
her
so
he
moved
to
the
door
opposite
to
that
through
which
rockwell
had
slipped
away
fifteen
minutes
earlier
and
opened
it
for
her
she
passed
through
into
the
darkness
of
the
other
room
he
felt
for
the
switch
and
pushed
it
as
the
light
went
on
she
turned
and
smiled
at
him
thank
you
for
an
instant
it
seemed
to
him
perhaps
to
both
of
them
that
she
was
really
his
wife
who
was
leaving
him
for
a
few
minutes
only
whom
he
would
soon
rejoin
then
he
turned
to
face
mayor
black
i
need
stay
only
a
minute
senator
the
mayor
was
saying
if
i
had
known
you
were
engaged
with
norman
i
shouldn
t
have
bothered
you
it
wasn
t
really
necessary
i
met
crockett
downstairs
while
i
was
waiting
he
told
me
the
answer
but
since
i
had
the
engagement
with
you
i
came
up
if
i
may
i
ll
write
the
veto
right
here
and
then
i
can
go
on
to
the
council
meeting
as
he
spoke
he
drew
a
thick
roll
of
paper
from
his
overcoat
pocket
unfolded
it
opened
it
at
the
last
sheet
and
laid
it
on
a
small
writing
table
i
shan
t
give
any
reasons
he
added
sitting
down
and
picking
up
a
pen
least
said
soonest
mended
eh
senator
but
you
re
not
to
veto
you
re
to
sign
cried
merriam
perhaps
if
he
had
more
fully
grasped
the
significance
of
the
other
s
statement
about
crockett
he
would
have
been
less
abrupt
but
that
mighty
financier
was
only
a
dim
name
to
his
mind
what
said
black
turning
in
his
chair
the
mayor
s
tone
gave
merriam
some
realisation
of
the
seriousness
of
the
new
situation
but
he
could
only
stand
to
his
guns
you
re
to
i
don
t
care
what
crockett
said
i
don
t
care
a
damn
what
he
said
he
corrected
himself
you
do
what
i
say
damn
you
but
how
is
this
exclaimed
the
mayor
crockett
said
you
fully
agreed
that
the
best
interests
he
stopped
looking
intently
at
merriam
in
the
excitement
of
the
dialogue
which
had
followed
merriam
s
sending
for
mollie
june
rockwell
had
neglected
the
precaution
he
had
had
in
mind
of
having
only
side
lights
on
rockwell
had
planned
also
that
merriam
should
sit
facing
the
gas
log
with
his
back
to
the
room
and
look
at
the
mayor
as
little
as
possible
now
the
boy
stood
where
the
full
glare
of
the
chandelier
shone
on
his
face
perhaps
too
the
emotions
of
a
youthful
love
scene
such
as
he
had
just
passed
through
were
not
the
best
preparation
in
the
world
for
counterfeiting
the
slightly
worn
cheeks
and
slightly
tired
eyes
of
an
elderly
if
politician
who
in
hell
are
you
gasped
the
mayor
merriam
was
certainly
startled
perhaps
he
showed
it
just
a
little
but
he
stood
up
bravely
you
know
damn
well
who
i
am
and
you
do
as
i
say
or
get
out
of
chicago
politics
i
ll
attend
to
crockett
he
added
that
s
my
affair
is
that
so
well
i
guess
it
s
my
affair
who
makes
a
monkey
of
me
i
again
the
mayor
stopped
abruptly
and
stared
then
suddenly
he
rose
i
was
told
the
senator
had
left
the
hotel
i
think
i
was
correctly
informed
what
sort
of
a
trick
is
this
who
you
damn
you
merriam
began
with
realistic
sincerity
but
with
the
vaguest
ideas
as
to
what
more
substantial
statement
should
follow
at
this
moment
however
rockwell
opened
his
door
and
stepped
into
the
room
aha
cried
the
mayor
no
stage
villain
could
have
said
it
better
rockwell
of
the
reform
league
i
believe
he
bowed
sardonically
rockwell
well
one
thing
at
a
time
like
this
he
pointed
at
merriam
ought
to
be
enough
for
a
reformer
good
evening
mayor
black
said
rockwell
i
believe
you
were
about
to
sign
the
ordinance
i
was
in
spite
of
the
here
i
don
t
get
a
chance
to
defy
senator
norman
every
day
i
rather
enjoy
it
and
let
me
tell
you
he
added
if
you
and
your
friends
in
that
damned
league
make
any
more
trouble
for
me
or
senator
norman
or
the
ordinance
or
anything
else
after
this
if
you
don
t
shut
up
and
lie
low
and
keep
pretty
damn
quiet
we
ll
show
you
up
my
boy
this
would
make
a
pretty
little
story
for
the
newspapers
and
for
the
state
s
attorney
too
we
might
call
it
the
ethics
of
reform
oh
we
have
you
where
we
want
you
now
reformer
as
for
this
young
impostor
here
we
ll
have
to
look
him
up
a
bit
a
very
promising
young
gentleman
the
mayor
evidently
enjoyed
the
center
of
the
stage
he
towered
tall
and
imposing
and
righteous
and
looked
triumphantly
from
rockwell
to
merriam
and
back
again
i
really
think
you
d
better
sign
it
said
rockwell
he
spoke
rather
low
what
do
you
mean
cried
the
mayor
then
he
thought
he
saw
oh
it
s
work
next
is
it
there
was
a
note
of
alarm
mingled
with
his
irony
and
the
magnificence
of
his
pose
weakened
a
little
rockwell
was
a
fellow
and
there
was
merriam
to
help
him
and
the
mayor
was
not
really
a
very
brave
man
but
he
went
on
talking
to
save
his
face
you
certainly
are
a
jewel
of
a
reformer
rockwell
then
he
saw
a
point
and
quickly
recovered
his
full
grandeur
i
don
t
quite
see
how
you
re
going
to
manage
though
of
course
if
it
were
a
case
of
me
from
signing
you
might
do
it
the
two
of
you
but
signing
s
rather
different
isn
t
it
you
can
lead
a
horse
to
water
of
course
you
can
club
me
or
hold
a
revolver
to
my
head
but
you
see
i
know
you
wouldn
t
dare
to
fire
a
revolver
here
in
this
room
so
just
how
will
you
force
my
fingers
to
form
the
letters
or
perhaps
you
will
try
forgery
is
forgery
the
next
act
mr
reformer
rockwell
smiled
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
reply
merriam
still
stood
as
he
had
throughout
this
unforeseen
dialogue
a
rigid
spectator
then
in
the
moment
s
silence
very
inopportunely
a
clock
somewhere
outside
struck
the
hour
a
quarter
to
nine
rockwell
tried
to
drown
it
saying
i
m
hardly
so
versatile
as
that
but
the
mayor
had
heard
and
understood
oh
that
s
it
he
cried
yes
that
s
it
said
rockwell
and
the
center
of
the
stage
automatically
shifted
to
him
if
that
ordinance
is
not
returned
to
the
council
with
your
veto
by
nine
o
clock
it
becomes
a
law
whether
you
sign
it
or
not
you
re
a
bit
slow
mayor
but
you
ve
got
it
at
last
the
mayor
did
not
answer
he
shifted
slightly
on
his
feet
his
hand
shot
out
he
grabbed
the
ordinance
from
the
waiting
table
and
rushed
for
the
door
catch
him
shouted
rockwell
hold
him
merriam
had
been
a
football
player
as
if
released
from
a
spring
he
darted
after
the
mayor
from
habit
he
tackled
low
they
went
down
with
something
of
a
crash
knocking
over
an
ash
stand
as
they
fell
and
the
mayor
gave
a
groan
if
he
had
ever
known
how
to
fall
properly
he
had
forgotten
merriam
hoped
there
were
no
bones
broken
but
rockwell
was
wasting
no
thoughts
on
commiseration
he
was
kneeling
over
the
fallen
ruler
of
the
city
with
his
hands
clapped
over
his
mouth
to
prevent
further
groans
or
other
outcry
get
the
paper
he
said
merriam
scrambled
forward
and
tried
to
pull
the
ordinance
from
the
hand
at
the
end
of
the
outstretched
arm
it
was
held
tight
he
was
afraid
of
tearing
it
twist
his
arm
said
rockwell
a
very
little
twist
sufficed
the
mayor
gave
up
merriam
rose
to
his
feet
with
the
document
will
you
be
quiet
rockwell
demanded
in
the
mayor
s
ear
and
released
his
mouth
enough
to
enable
him
to
answer
yes
said
the
mayor
feebly
let
me
up
all
right
that
s
better
if
you
make
any
rumpus
we
ll
down
you
again
you
know
and
tie
you
up
and
gag
give
me
the
paper
he
added
to
merriam
and
help
him
up
will
you
he
stood
watching
while
the
younger
man
assisted
the
mayor
in
the
ponderous
job
of
getting
on
his
feet
i
hope
you
aren
t
hurt
sir
said
merriam
the
mayor
looked
sourly
at
him
thanks
he
felt
of
his
arms
and
passed
his
hands
up
and
down
over
his
ribs
i
guess
i
m
all
right
except
my
clothes
in
fact
his
white
shirt
front
was
crumpled
and
his
broadcloth
coat
and
trousers
were
dusty
with
cigar
ash
from
the
fallen
stand
merriam
was
in
little
better
condition
they
were
not
dressed
for
football
practice
rockwell
only
was
still
immaculate
i
ll
get
a
brush
said
merriam
no
longer
a
senator
he
felt
very
boyish
and
anxious
to
be
useful
as
he
spoke
he
turned
to
the
room
the
fall
had
occurred
near
the
door
into
the
hall
and
stopped
nonplused
for
in
her
bedroom
door
stood
mollie
june
her
eyes
full
at
once
of
eagerness
and
of
apprehension
how
much
she
had
heard
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
perhaps
some
of
merriam
s
unprofessorial
profanity
possibly
the
mayor
s
triumphant
irony
certainly
rockwell
s
shout
catch
him
and
the
fall
doubtless
the
silence
after
that
thud
had
been
too
much
for
her
the
mayor
s
rueful
gaze
travelling
past
merriam
also
rested
on
mollie
june
a
light
came
into
his
eyes
he
drew
himself
up
come
in
norman
he
said
your
with
a
significant
emphasis
on
the
word
has
been
giving
a
demonstration
of
his
athletic
prowess
he
is
indeed
the
boy
senator
and
a
suitable
mate
for
a
woman
as
young
and
pretty
as
yourself
he
paid
no
attention
to
merriam
s
angry
and
threatening
glance
but
turned
to
rockwell
rockwell
he
said
i
think
you
d
better
give
me
that
ordinance
after
all
rockwell
spoke
in
a
low
tone
to
merriam
get
her
out
the
mayor
had
no
objection
to
that
the
older
men
watched
while
merriam
walked
rapidly
across
the
room
to
mollie
june
you
d
better
go
into
the
other
room
again
dear
he
said
but
mollie
june
s
eyes
were
bright
and
her
colour
high
and
her
white
shoulders
very
straight
no
she
said
you
really
will
oblige
us
greatly
norman
said
the
mayor
if
you
will
withdraw
for
a
moment
longer
no
said
mollie
june
this
is
my
room
i
have
a
right
to
be
here
and
i
don
t
like
scuffling
she
cast
a
disdainful
glance
at
their
crumpled
shirts
and
dusty
trousers
and
womanlike
she
sought
a
diversion
what
a
mess
you
are
in
she
cried
george
get
the
whisk
broom
from
the
bedroom
there
it
was
an
almost
haughty
command
and
merriam
rejoiced
to
obey
this
new
mistress
of
the
situation
he
darted
into
the
bedroom
the
two
older
men
looked
at
each
other
rockwell
was
content
time
was
passing
when
the
mayor
started
to
speak
he
forestalled
him
she
s
really
right
he
said
you
can
t
leave
like
this
and
some
one
might
come
in
merriam
was
back
with
the
whisk
broom
come
under
the
light
ordered
mollie
june
addressing
the
mayor
that
dignitary
reluctantly
advanced
turn
around
now
george
brush
him
merriam
sought
diligently
to
remove
the
ashes
from
the
mayor
s
garments
it
required
vigorous
work
for
the
dust
was
rubbed
deeply
into
the
cloth
mollie
june
superintended
closely
the
mayor
had
to
turn
about
several
times
and
raise
an
arm
and
then
the
other
arm
he
could
not
make
much
progress
in
the
regaining
of
his
dignity
and
he
no
less
than
rockwell
was
conscious
of
the
fleeing
moments
but
glancing
again
and
again
at
mollie
june
girlishly
imperious
and
intent
he
could
not
as
yet
muster
his
brutality
for
what
he
saw
the
next
move
in
his
game
must
be
rockwell
waited
serenely
in
the
background
the
ordinance
in
his
hand
at
last
the
mayor
s
broadcloth
was
fairly
presentable
nothing
could
be
done
of
course
with
his
shirt
front
now
george
said
mollie
june
it
s
your
turn
give
me
the
broom
no
no
me
the
broom
she
took
it
from
his
hand
turn
around
and
with
her
own
hands
and
in
the
manner
of
wifely
solicitude
she
began
to
dust
his
collar
and
lapels
this
was
not
unpleasant
for
merriam
but
it
prompted
the
mayor
to
take
his
cue
as
he
watched
his
eyes
hardened
and
in
a
moment
he
said
you
take
good
care
of
your
don
t
you
mrs
norman
i
try
to
said
mollie
june
rather
pertly
dusting
away
evidently
she
had
not
heard
enough
to
know
that
merriam
had
been
found
out
it
must
be
pleasant
said
the
mayor
to
have
such
a
nice
husband
mollie
june
stopped
her
work
and
looked
at
him
in
sudden
alarm
what
do
you
mean
she
said
rockwell
stepped
forward
and
caught
her
arm
let
me
lead
you
into
the
next
room
norman
you
must
let
us
talk
with
the
mayor
no
she
cried
snatching
her
arm
away
and
turning
eyes
of
angry
innocence
on
mayor
black
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
he
said
with
smiling
suavity
he
was
not
to
be
daunted
now
and
short
of
violence
there
was
no
way
of
stopping
him
that
you
are
a
young
woman
this
gentleman
whose
name
i
do
not
have
the
honour
of
knowing
is
also
young
and
rather
handsome
the
senator
of
course
is
getting
old
i
find
you
two
alone
in
your
husband
s
rooms
your
husband
having
been
tricked
away
you
can
hardly
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
mistook
him
for
your
husband
you
display
no
dislike
for
his
person
i
draw
my
own
conclusions
every
one
in
chicago
will
draw
the
same
conclusions
if
this
interesting
situation
quite
worthy
of
boccaccio
should
become
known
that
s
why
i
think
he
turned
suddenly
to
rockwell
that
you
d
better
give
me
the
ordinance
after
all
mollie
june
s
cheeks
were
blazing
merriam
s
also
he
could
not
look
at
her
but
rockwell
pulled
his
watch
from
his
pocket
it
is
now
two
minutes
past
nine
he
said
the
ordinance
has
become
law
you
can
have
it
now
mr
mayor
he
held
out
the
document
the
mayor
snatched
it
it
s
not
legal
he
cried
and
it
won
t
stand
i
can
prove
that
i
was
prevented
by
foul
means
by
foul
means
he
repeated
from
exercising
my
charter
right
of
veto
i
ll
take
out
an
injunction
and
i
ll
fight
it
to
the
supreme
court
and
in
the
process
all
chicago
the
whole
united
states
shall
be
entertained
with
the
piquant
story
of
these
young
people
he
waved
a
hand
towards
merriam
and
mollie
june
aided
and
abetted
by
reformer
rockwell
i
ll
ruin
them
and
you
and
your
league
whatever
else
comes
of
it
oh
you
re
a
clever
lot
you
you
reformers
he
paused
out
of
breath
then
dramatically
for
he
was
always
and
inclined
to
pose
madame
and
gentlemen
but
the
effectiveness
of
his
bow
was
somewhat
marred
by
the
sorry
state
of
his
shirt
front
i
wish
you
a
very
good
evening
but
rockwell
was
before
him
with
his
back
to
the
hall
door
you
ve
forgotten
your
hat
mayor
he
said
in
fact
his
tall
hat
still
stood
on
the
writing
table
where
he
had
set
it
down
before
he
spread
out
the
ordinance
there
to
write
his
veto
damn
my
hat
let
me
go
presently
presently
i
still
think
you
d
better
sign
the
ordinance
do
you
mean
to
knock
me
down
again
i
d
like
nothing
better
you
cad
cried
merriam
who
had
stood
bursting
with
outrage
a
minute
longer
than
he
could
endure
the
mayor
almost
jumped
at
the
savage
sincerity
of
this
threat
in
his
rear
rockwell
smiled
at
the
startled
look
on
his
face
but
he
spoke
quietly
no
violence
i
hope
to
convince
you
that
it
would
be
to
your
best
interests
to
sign
it
since
it
has
become
a
law
anyway
never
cried
the
mayor
do
you
think
i
would
be
a
traitor
to
to
my
party
and
i
mean
to
get
even
with
this
gang
whatever
else
i
do
but
the
next
instant
he
jumped
indeed
a
new
voice
spoke
a
woman
s
mayor
black
it
said
you
re
a
fool
all
four
of
the
actors
in
the
little
scene
turned
and
mollie
june
uttered
an
exclamation
aunt
mary
in
the
doorway
from
which
rockwell
had
emerged
a
few
minutes
earlier
stood
the
thin
pale
elderly
woman
whom
merriam
had
seen
with
mollie
june
in
the
peacock
cabaret
she
wore
a
black
evening
gown
rather
too
heavily
overlaid
with
jet
was
tall
and
very
erect
and
had
streaked
gray
hair
a
roman
nose
and
a
firm
mouth
the
effect
as
she
stood
there
framed
in
the
door
was
decidedly
striking
sibylline
mollie
june
ran
to
her
oh
aunt
mary
she
cried
merriam
was
afraid
that
mollie
june
would
burst
into
tears
very
possibly
she
would
have
liked
to
do
so
but
aunt
mary
gave
her
no
opportunity
lock
the
door
rockwell
she
said
putting
an
arm
about
mollie
june
s
waist
her
tone
and
manner
were
vigorous
and
dominant
good
evening
black
she
continued
while
rockwell
hastened
to
obey
her
and
to
merriam
good
evening
wilson
now
i
think
we
had
better
all
sit
down
and
talk
it
over
i
can
t
said
the
mayor
i
m
late
for
the
council
meeting
already
i
ve
been
shamefully
tricked
miss
norman
i
think
you
have
returned
aunt
mary
releasing
mollie
june
and
advancing
a
step
or
two
into
the
room
but
that
s
the
very
reason
why
you
need
to
consider
your
position
at
once
you
re
in
a
mess
so
are
we
perhaps
we
can
help
each
other
out
the
council
can
wait
phone
them
that
you
ve
been
detained
they
can
go
ahead
i
suppose
really
black
i
see
a
point
or
two
in
this
business
that
i
think
will
interest
you
mayor
black
met
mary
norman
s
direct
purposeful
gaze
he
was
impressed
by
her
air
of
command
and
intelligence
he
recalled
gossip
to
the
effect
that
it
was
really
she
who
ran
george
norman
s
campaigns
that
she
even
wrote
some
of
his
speeches
very
well
he
said
i
ll
stay
ten
minutes
never
mind
phoning
good
said
aunt
mary
there
are
seats
for
all
of
us
i
believe
take
that
one
mayor
she
indicated
the
large
armchair
with
the
tapestry
in
which
mollie
june
had
been
ensconced
half
an
hour
before
and
laid
her
own
hand
on
the
back
of
the
smaller
one
close
by
in
which
merriam
had
sat
then
she
turned
to
mollie
june
do
you
wish
to
leave
us
dear
or
to
stay
i
ll
stay
said
mollie
june
her
colour
was
still
high
and
the
glance
she
threw
in
the
mayor
s
direction
was
distinctly
hostile
but
she
had
recovered
her
we
shall
be
able
to
forgive
young
merriam
a
throb
of
admiration
at
her
spirit
very
well
said
aunt
mary
sit
over
there
then
wilson
she
added
to
merriam
on
that
table
yonder
you
will
find
a
humidor
pass
the
cigars
please
and
pick
up
that
ash
stand
and
set
it
here
by
the
mayor
she
and
the
mayor
and
mollie
june
sat
down
rockwell
remained
standing
merriam
though
somewhat
confused
at
having
turned
from
norman
into
wilson
hastened
to
do
as
he
was
bid
he
picked
up
the
ash
stand
straightening
the
box
of
matches
into
place
and
brought
it
and
set
it
by
the
mayor
s
chair
then
he
got
the
humidor
opened
its
heavy
lid
and
passed
the
perfectos
therein
to
the
mayor
and
to
rockwell
are
you
leaving
me
out
young
man
demanded
aunt
mary
who
had
watched
him
in
appraising
silence
merriam
turned
to
her
with
the
humidor
hesitating
there
don
t
seem
to
be
any
cigarettes
he
said
i
have
some
in
my
pocket
but
aunt
mary
leaned
forward
and
took
from
the
humidor
a
package
of
little
cigars
that
had
been
slipped
in
at
one
end
of
the
box
of
perfectos
no
cigarettes
for
me
she
said
i
smoke
when
i
m
with
men
so
as
to
be
one
of
them
a
cigarette
leaves
me
a
woman
a
cigar
even
one
of
these
little
ones
makes
a
man
of
me
give
me
a
match
please
with
what
seemed
to
himself
amazing
merriam
took
a
match
from
the
ash
stand
struck
it
and
would
have
held
the
light
for
her
but
aunt
mary
took
it
from
him
and
looking
all
the
while
amazingly
like
his
own
mother
deliberately
and
efficiently
ignited
the
little
cigar
then
she
looked
up
quizzically
at
merriam
blew
out
the
match
handed
it
to
him
and
said
sit
down
mr
wilson
having
seated
himself
merriam
found
aunt
mary
looking
intently
at
the
mayor
who
was
smoking
and
returning
her
gaze
but
rockwell
broke
in
how
much
do
you
know
miss
norman
and
how
do
you
know
it
as
to
how
i
know
it
said
aunt
mary
that
s
my
own
business
for
the
present
not
because
there
need
be
any
secret
about
it
but
because
we
haven
t
time
for
explanations
she
puffed
at
her
little
cigar
as
to
how
much
i
know
i
believe
i
understand
the
whole
affair
except
how
norman
came
into
it
she
looked
at
rockwell
that
gentleman
did
not
reply
merriam
broke
the
silence
i
sent
for
her
he
said
it
very
well
not
defiantly
but
as
a
plain
necessary
statement
of
fact
aunt
mary
turned
in
her
chair
to
look
at
him
ah
she
said
he
felt
that
he
was
colouring
under
her
gaze
perhaps
that
colour
answered
her
obvious
next
question
as
to
why
he
had
done
so
she
did
not
ask
that
question
but
turned
back
to
the
mayor
i
overheard
a
little
of
your
conversation
from
the
doorway
before
i
spoke
rockwell
was
saying
he
thought
that
as
things
stand
now
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
sign
the
ordinance
i
think
so
too
the
mayor
would
have
interrupted
but
she
waved
her
little
cigar
at
him
you
can
of
course
she
continued
explain
that
you
were
tricked
but
how
much
would
that
help
you
with
crockett
or
any
of
his
cronies
and
allies
they
would
only
think
the
worse
of
you
and
throw
you
over
the
more
quickly
a
man
of
your
age
and
standing
can
not
afford
to
be
tricked
if
he
is
he
had
better
conceal
the
fact
and
how
about
the
people
of
chicago
before
whom
you
come
up
for
reëlection
in
the
fall
will
their
sympathies
be
with
you
or
with
the
persons
who
tricked
you
into
giving
them
the
ordinance
they
wanted
the
american
people
love
a
clever
trick
and
a
trick
is
clever
if
it
succeeds
as
for
the
illegality
they
won
t
care
a
picayune
for
that
you
said
you
would
fight
it
in
the
courts
well
you
might
but
it
would
be
a
long
fight
you
yourself
mentioned
the
supreme
court
and
in
the
meantime
it
is
a
law
and
goes
into
effect
at
once
unless
of
course
you
take
out
an
injunction
and
if
you
do
that
you
will
make
yourself
so
unpopular
that
you
can
never
even
be
nominated
again
let
us
suppose
it
goes
into
effect
then
by
the
time
your
fight
was
won
if
you
won
it
the
new
conditions
would
be
established
and
nobody
would
dare
try
to
unscramble
the
eggs
the
council
would
simply
have
to
pass
it
over
again
and
you
or
your
successor
rather
for
you
would
be
out
by
then
would
promptly
sign
it
no
my
friend
there
is
no
road
for
you
in
that
direction
you
would
lose
out
both
ways
with
the
bosses
who
would
have
no
more
use
for
a
man
who
had
allowed
himself
to
be
fooled
at
a
critical
juncture
and
with
the
people
your
only
chance
unless
you
wish
to
retire
quickly
and
ignominiously
to
private
life
is
to
cut
loose
from
the
bosses
and
throw
in
your
lot
with
the
people
sign
the
ordinance
claim
the
credit
join
forces
with
rockwell
here
defy
crockett
and
come
out
as
the
people
s
champion
the
mayor
was
not
smoking
he
was
looking
hard
at
aunt
mary
as
one
man
looks
at
another
her
little
cigar
had
effected
that
there
was
aroused
interest
in
his
eyes
wouldn
t
you
rather
like
to
go
into
politics
as
your
own
boss
for
a
change
aunt
mary
asked
rather
than
as
one
miserable
little
cog
in
a
big
dirty
machine
the
mayor
flushed
a
little
and
took
refuge
behind
a
puff
of
smoke
perhaps
i
would
he
said
then
suddenly
how
about
senator
norman
do
i
defy
him
too
not
at
all
said
aunt
mary
he
also
will
go
over
to
the
people
can
you
answer
for
him
i
think
i
can
he
will
be
forced
to
do
so
in
the
same
way
you
are
he
too
has
been
victimised
she
leaned
forward
and
deposited
her
small
cigar
of
which
she
had
really
smoked
very
little
in
the
ash
tray
sitting
erect
she
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
became
forthwith
a
woman
again
a
sedate
almost
prim
elderly
woman
that
she
explained
simply
is
the
source
of
my
interest
in
this
matter
i
like
you
mayor
black
because
you
have
some
of
the
courtliness
of
the
old
school
in
your
manner
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
you
in
misfortune
but
i
care
much
more
naturally
for
my
brother
george
norman
and
more
still
for
the
name
of
norman
from
her
tone
she
might
have
referred
to
the
deity
which
has
been
an
honourable
name
in
this
country
for
eight
generations
and
which
george
with
his
spoils
politics
and
his
dissipations
is
compromising
i
have
long
wanted
him
to
break
with
his
present
associates
to
live
straight
and
to
become
a
real
leader
as
the
normans
were
in
new
york
state
in
the
early
years
of
the
last
century
i
have
tried
again
and
again
to
get
him
to
do
so
over
and
over
he
has
promised
me
he
would
but
he
is
weak
he
has
never
done
it
now
he
will
have
to
do
it
all
the
members
of
the
little
group
looked
with
some
admiration
i
fancy
at
aunt
mary
sitting
straight
an
incarnation
of
aristocratic
elderly
femininity
in
her
chair
where
a
moment
or
two
before
she
had
been
an
unsexed
modern
she
looked
now
like
an
old
family
portrait
rockwell
broke
the
momentary
silence
miss
norman
has
presented
so
much
better
than
i
could
have
done
the
argument
which
i
tried
to
suggest
to
mr
black
it
was
probably
unfortunate
that
rockwell
had
recalled
attention
to
himself
the
mayor
glanced
at
him
with
animosity
and
at
the
silent
merriam
and
over
at
mollie
june
listening
eagerly
in
the
background
then
at
aunt
mary
again
he
leaned
back
pulling
at
his
cigar
thinking
hard
in
the
silence
a
slight
noise
became
audible
from
the
bedroom
behind
aunt
mary
a
word
or
two
of
whispering
and
then
a
sound
as
if
some
one
tiptoeing
had
stumbled
a
little
the
mayor
jumped
to
his
feet
who
s
there
he
cried
pointing
for
an
instant
aunt
mary
was
out
of
countenance
but
only
for
an
instant
then
without
rising
or
turning
her
head
she
called
come
in
alicia
a
moment
s
silence
then
a
laugh
of
a
premeditated
sweetness
which
merriam
remembered
and
alicia
wayward
stood
in
the
doorway
the
mayor
and
merriam
rose
mollie
june
too
jumped
up
only
aunt
mary
remained
calmly
seated
after
a
second
s
pause
in
the
effective
framing
of
the
door
alicia
advanced
with
an
air
of
eager
pleasure
and
held
out
her
hand
to
the
mayor
good
evening
mr
black
the
mayor
was
a
very
susceptible
male
where
women
like
alicia
were
concerned
he
took
her
hand
good
evening
miss
wayward
but
still
holding
the
hand
he
looked
steadily
at
her
and
asked
who
else
is
in
there
who
else
repeated
alicia
raising
her
pretty
dark
eyebrows
or
were
you
whispering
to
yourself
pursued
the
mayor
alicia
laughed
and
drew
her
hand
away
it
s
only
father
murray
then
raising
her
voice
a
little
you
ll
have
to
come
in
father
murray
to
save
my
reputation
this
is
really
all
of
us
she
added
as
the
priest
rather
sheepishly
presented
himself
you
can
search
the
room
if
you
like
she
smiled
at
him
in
the
manner
which
novelists
commonly
describe
as
roguish
the
mayor
smiled
back
at
her
but
he
turned
to
the
latest
arrival
were
you
in
this
plot
too
father
murray
indeed
he
was
alicia
answered
for
him
he
didn
t
quite
approve
of
it
at
first
but
we
quite
easily
converted
him
so
you
see
it
can
t
be
so
black
as
it
first
seemed
to
you
mayor
and
really
she
hurried
on
you
ought
to
do
as
miss
norman
suggests
it
s
a
splendid
chance
for
you
to
really
be
a
a
man
you
know
and
i
can
help
how
can
you
help
asked
the
mayor
i
am
quite
sure
said
alicia
that
i
can
get
my
father
to
subscribe
quite
a
lot
of
money
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
say
to
your
campaign
fund
yours
and
senator
norman
s
and
the
reform
league
s
is
wayward
so
keen
on
reform
i
should
think
he
had
had
nearly
enough
of
it
they
ve
practically
put
him
out
of
business
these
reformers
he
s
rather
keen
on
me
you
know
said
alicia
and
he
likes
mollie
june
and
miss
norman
and
george
norman
and
father
murray
i
suppose
interrupted
the
mayor
and
anybody
else
you
can
think
of
you
mean
you
can
get
it
out
of
him
but
his
appreciative
smile
made
a
compliment
of
the
accusation
alicia
only
raised
her
eyebrows
again
aunt
mary
rose
and
took
the
reins
of
business
into
her
own
hands
once
more
i
should
be
willing
to
subscribe
something
too
out
of
my
own
income
she
said
and
the
league
can
raise
plenty
of
money
you
won
t
lack
for
funds
here
s
my
proposition
black
you
lie
low
and
keep
still
till
noon
don
t
go
to
the
council
meeting
at
all
keep
the
ordinance
in
your
own
possession
refuse
to
see
any
one
see
what
the
papers
say
in
the
morning
and
wait
for
a
message
from
george
norman
if
by
noon
he
telephones
you
that
he
will
go
with
you
will
you
go
over
to
the
league
sign
the
ordinance
break
with
crockett
and
the
rest
of
them
and
appeal
to
the
people
on
your
own
the
mayor
looked
from
aunt
mary
to
alicia
s
appealing
and
admiring
eyes
and
back
at
aunt
mary
he
avoided
rockwell
and
merriam
and
mollie
june
that
s
fair
enough
he
said
i
ll
do
that
then
you
know
where
norman
is
do
you
yes
said
aunt
mary
it
was
plain
however
that
she
did
not
intend
to
communicate
the
information
and
what
becomes
of
this
young
gentleman
the
mayor
looked
at
merriam
he
will
disappear
where
he
came
from
well
well
said
the
mayor
genially
it
has
been
a
very
stimulating
evening
rather
like
a
play
you
have
certainly
put
me
in
a
box
but
i
ll
admit
i
m
interested
in
your
suggestion
miss
norman
i
ll
think
it
over
carefully
now
i
believe
i
ll
call
a
taxi
let
me
said
rockwell
and
he
stepped
to
the
telephone
the
mayor
addressed
himself
to
merriam
will
you
bring
me
my
hat
wilson
merriam
was
near
the
writing
table
on
which
the
hat
stood
he
picked
it
up
and
brought
it
the
resemblance
is
marvellously
close
said
the
mayor
studying
his
face
and
you
did
your
part
very
well
young
man
but
let
me
advise
you
to
keep
away
from
the
neighbourhood
of
senator
norman
you
might
get
into
serious
trouble
merriam
did
not
reply
or
smile
but
handed
him
the
hat
there
s
a
taxi
ready
said
rockwell
turning
from
the
telephone
into
which
he
had
been
speaking
thank
you
said
the
mayor
he
looked
at
mollie
june
who
stood
some
distance
from
him
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
norman
for
my
rudeness
earlier
this
evening
i
am
afraid
i
was
too
angry
then
to
know
what
i
was
saying
like
merriam
mollie
june
did
not
answer
or
smile
possibly
she
was
imitating
his
demeanour
but
she
bowed
slightly
really
interjected
alicia
mollie
june
had
never
seen
wilson
since
before
she
was
married
until
five
minutes
before
you
came
in
quite
so
of
course
said
the
mayor
he
held
out
his
hand
to
aunt
mary
you
are
a
wonderful
woman
miss
norman
george
shall
telephone
before
noon
she
replied
shaking
hands
like
a
man
till
then
at
least
you
can
depend
on
me
he
turned
to
alicia
alicia
kept
his
hand
a
long
minute
we
have
always
liked
you
black
we
women
she
said
in
your
new
rôle
we
shall
admire
you
so
much
i
would
do
much
to
win
your
admiration
returned
the
mayor
somewhat
guardedly
gallant
good
night
father
murray
good
night
rockwell
you
precious
reformer
good
night
wilson
that
s
only
a
stage
name
isn
t
it
well
good
night
all
the
suave
politician
bowed
himself
out
senator
the
members
of
the
group
that
remained
looked
at
one
another
alicia
dropped
into
a
chair
whew
she
said
father
murray
crossed
quickly
from
the
doorway
where
he
had
stood
silent
ever
since
his
shamefaced
entrance
to
aunt
mary
s
side
wonderful
miss
norman
he
cried
aunt
mary
smiled
at
him
her
first
smile
in
that
scene
thank
you
arthur
she
said
but
she
added
instantly
to
rockwell
see
if
george
is
telephone
he
must
be
by
now
then
you
and
arthur
must
take
a
taxi
and
go
after
him
and
bring
him
back
here
the
number
is
harrison
rockwell
turned
back
to
the
telephone
merriam
walked
over
to
mollie
june
and
put
his
hands
on
the
back
of
the
chair
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
prior
to
the
entrance
of
alicia
hadn
t
you
better
sit
down
he
said
yes
if
you
ll
move
it
up
a
little
she
wanted
to
be
closer
to
the
rest
of
the
group
he
pushed
the
chair
forward
and
she
sat
and
smiled
up
at
him
thank
you
a
woman
s
eyes
are
never
so
appealingly
beautiful
as
in
a
quick
upward
glance
merriam
fell
suddenly
more
deeply
in
love
with
her
than
he
had
ever
been
and
he
was
for
the
moment
very
happy
there
was
something
between
them
something
very
slight
as
tenuous
and
as
innocent
as
youth
itself
but
existent
and
precious
rockwell
turned
from
the
telephone
he
s
not
he
said
and
he
s
not
been
there
there
was
a
tacit
conspiracy
among
them
on
account
of
mollie
june
not
to
refer
more
definitely
to
george
s
destination
not
exclaimed
aunt
mary
like
the
men
she
was
still
standing
she
looked
at
alicia
the
driver
was
instructed
to
go
directly
there
yes
said
alicia
then
she
added
in
a
low
tone
the
driver
was
simpson
simpson
aunt
mary
echoed
that
s
dangerous
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
that
before
the
reader
will
have
guessed
the
explanation
of
aunt
mary
s
presence
and
alicia
s
and
father
murray
s
and
i
insert
it
here
only
to
gratify
his
sense
of
acumen
that
alicia
and
murray
keeping
an
eye
on
mollie
june
and
aunt
mary
in
accordance
with
rockwell
s
plan
in
the
hotel
lobby
had
witnessed
the
former
s
unexpected
departure
in
response
to
merriam
s
summons
and
had
joined
miss
norman
to
find
out
what
had
happened
and
that
aunt
mary
who
was
more
than
a
match
for
both
of
them
especially
in
their
alarm
over
mollie
june
s
being
dragged
into
the
affair
had
obtained
first
an
inkling
and
presently
the
whole
story
of
the
plot
and
had
insisted
on
coming
upstairs
and
had
entered
through
the
bedroom
alicia
did
not
reply
to
aunt
mary
s
question
indeed
she
hardly
had
time
to
do
so
for
aunt
mary
followed
it
quickly
with
another
of
a
more
practical
character
what
time
is
it
merriam
was
the
most
prompt
in
producing
his
watch
ten
o
clock
he
said
and
it
was
barely
eight
when
george
left
the
hotel
how
long
should
it
have
taken
to
get
there
less
than
half
an
hour
said
rockwell
are
you
sure
he
s
not
there
they
might
have
lied
to
you
they
might
but
i
didn
t
think
so
rockwell
and
i
can
go
and
see
volunteered
father
murray
who
seemed
very
eager
to
be
helpful
while
aunt
mary
was
considering
this
suggestion
merriam
had
an
idea
my
voice
is
very
like
senator
norman
s
he
asked
yes
it
is
said
aunt
mary
then
let
me
telephone
good
cried
rockwell
from
the
bedroom
this
was
of
course
to
spare
mollie
june
very
well
said
aunt
mary
the
two
men
stepped
into
george
norman
s
bedroom
the
one
into
which
mollie
june
had
earlier
retreated
as
they
did
so
aunt
mary
s
eyes
followed
merriam
with
the
appraising
look
which
they
had
held
whenever
she
regarded
him
throughout
the
evening
rockwell
shut
the
door
harrison
he
said
say
this
is
george
norman
and
ask
for
the
telephone
was
on
the
night
table
merriam
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
raised
the
instrument
he
realised
that
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
to
expect
rockwell
sat
beside
him
close
enough
to
hear
what
should
come
through
the
receiver
in
a
moment
merriam
had
the
connection
a
not
unmusical
voice
said
who
is
it
please
this
is
george
norman
is
jennie
there
why
georgie
boy
don
t
you
know
me
you
always
do
and
you
ought
to
a
tender
little
laugh
followed
which
thrilled
merriam
in
spite
of
himself
i
didn
t
at
first
he
answered
and
stopped
at
a
loss
rockwell
put
his
mouth
close
to
merriam
s
ear
and
formed
a
tunnel
from
the
one
orifice
to
the
other
with
his
hands
can
i
see
you
dearie
he
prompted
can
i
see
you
dearie
merriam
obediently
repeated
oh
can
you
come
goodie
but
the
unmistakably
loving
voice
was
lowered
you
must
be
careful
georgie
careful
merriam
queried
cautiously
yes
some
one
thinks
you
re
here
already
who
i
don
t
know
some
man
he
wouldn
t
tell
me
who
he
was
he
called
up
just
a
minute
ago
he
was
awfully
sure
you
were
here
he
wouldn
t
believe
me
when
i
said
you
weren
t
is
it
dangerous
there
was
a
touching
note
of
anxiety
in
jennie
s
voice
i
guess
not
can
you
come
anyway
eagerly
i
m
not
sure
don
t
wait
for
me
long
i
ll
come
within
an
hour
if
i
can
get
away
you
ll
telephone
again
yes
if
i
can
georgie
boy
there
followed
a
little
sound
of
lips
moved
in
a
certain
way
unmistakably
a
kiss
john
merriam
played
up
with
an
effectiveness
that
surprised
himself
very
much
dearie
he
whispered
tenderly
into
the
telephone
good
night
and
abruptly
hung
up
you
don
t
need
much
prompting
exclaimed
rockwell
rising
well
she
didn
t
lie
to
me
no
merriam
assented
confusedly
whatever
else
he
had
anticipated
from
norman
s
mistress
the
disreputable
manicurist
it
had
not
been
that
note
of
sincere
affection
or
that
he
himself
would
be
for
an
instant
carried
off
his
feet
as
he
automatically
followed
rockwell
who
made
for
the
sitting
room
he
was
unwillingly
conscious
of
a
new
charity
for
george
norman
he
s
not
there
rockwell
reported
and
he
hasn
t
been
sure
aunt
mary
looked
at
merriam
our
hero
nodded
he
could
not
speak
and
he
dared
not
look
at
mollie
june
of
whose
bright
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
he
was
nevertheless
acutely
aware
in
a
moment
however
it
was
of
aunt
mary
s
gaze
that
he
was
sensible
she
seemed
to
read
him
through
he
thought
ridiculously
that
that
momentary
telephonic
tenderness
could
not
be
hid
from
her
but
when
she
spoke
her
question
both
relieved
and
startled
him
at
what
hour
in
the
morning
does
your
train
go
it
goes
at
if
george
is
back
here
by
then
it
does
said
aunt
mary
if
not
you
stay
but
i
go
cried
merriam
suddenly
awakened
to
realities
and
feeling
as
though
the
curtain
had
descended
abruptly
on
some
mad
combination
of
melodrama
and
farce
i
must
meet
my
classes
in
the
morning
aunt
mary
who
must
have
sat
down
while
the
two
men
were
telephoning
rose
and
walked
up
to
merriam
merriam
she
said
you
more
than
any
one
else
are
responsible
for
the
present
situation
because
of
your
sending
for
norman
i
don
t
ask
why
you
did
that
but
you
did
it
if
you
hadn
t
stepped
outside
your
part
that
way
i
verily
believe
when
i
look
at
you
that
the
trick
could
have
been
played
as
rockwell
planned
it
the
mayor
would
not
have
seen
crockett
downstairs
i
don
t
believe
he
would
have
recognised
you
he
would
have
signed
the
ordinance
and
gone
away
committed
and
ignorant
of
the
deception
now
he
s
only
half
committed
and
he
has
recognised
you
as
an
impostor
if
he
doesn
t
hear
from
george
norman
by
noon
as
i
promised
if
he
turns
against
us
and
tells
his
story
he
can
ruin
us
all
she
said
all
but
she
glanced
at
mollie
june
and
now
we
don
t
know
where
george
is
as
soon
as
we
find
him
you
can
go
but
mayor
black
must
get
a
message
from
senator
norman
before
noon
from
the
true
one
or
the
false
one
do
you
see
until
we
find
george
you
must
stay
yes
by
jove
cried
rockwell
you
can
t
back
out
now
you
can
telegraph
to
where
is
it
riceville
said
alicia
who
was
leaning
excitedly
forward
in
her
chair
oh
you
will
merriam
looked
at
alicia
the
same
combination
of
appeal
and
admiration
in
her
eyes
which
he
had
seen
her
work
a
few
minutes
before
on
the
mayor
did
not
move
him
his
eyes
travelled
to
the
face
of
mollie
june
she
was
not
leaning
forward
but
sat
erect
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
there
was
a
flush
of
excitement
was
it
eagerness
on
her
cheeks
unwillingly
he
compared
her
with
the
warm
seductiveness
of
the
voice
on
the
telephone
she
was
not
like
that
though
perhaps
she
could
be
but
she
was
radiantly
bright
and
pure
a
girl
a
woman
to
be
worshipped
and
protected
from
all
evil
he
remembered
how
he
had
wished
to
help
her
he
had
said
he
would
be
always
ready
now
was
his
chance
and
he
desired
passionately
to
expiate
his
involuntary
infidelity
of
feeling
and
tone
over
the
telephone
he
rose
superior
to
the
cares
the
duties
of
a
professor
even
before
she
spoke
oh
please
merriam
she
said
merriam
smiled
at
her
but
looked
back
at
aunt
mary
you
think
it
very
necessary
he
asked
not
because
he
had
not
decided
but
to
avoid
any
shadow
of
compromising
mollie
june
by
seeming
to
yield
directly
to
her
i
do
said
aunt
mary
then
of
course
i
ll
stay
said
merriam
of
waiter
no
from
a
sleep
which
had
been
heavy
but
was
becoming
restless
and
dreamful
merriam
was
awakened
about
seven
o
clock
the
next
morning
by
a
knocking
at
his
door
he
leaned
over
and
pulled
the
little
chain
of
the
night
lamp
and
as
the
light
glowed
asked
who
is
it
rockwell
came
the
answer
by
a
rather
athletic
bit
of
stretching
merriam
was
able
to
turn
the
key
in
his
lock
without
getting
out
of
bed
come
in
he
called
rockwell
entered
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
stood
looking
down
at
merriam
who
had
lain
back
on
his
pillow
slept
well
he
asked
like
a
football
player
laughed
merriam
somehow
ashamed
of
this
fact
feeling
fit
certainly
always
feel
fit
for
a
moment
longer
rockwell
looked
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
an
older
man
s
envy
of
the
unconscionable
imperturbability
of
youthful
health
then
he
said
well
i
have
news
merriam
waited
about
half
an
hour
ago
i
called
up
jennie
again
when
i
said
i
was
a
friend
of
norman
s
she
admitted
he
was
there
by
asking
a
good
many
questions
i
learned
that
he
turned
up
about
two
o
clock
this
morning
and
that
he
was
very
drunk
i
judge
he
s
having
a
touch
of
jennie
was
evidently
rather
disgusted
at
his
arriving
so
late
and
in
that
condition
after
your
affectionate
tone
earlier
in
the
evening
you
know
merriam
evaded
this
thrust
with
a
question
where
can
he
have
been
in
the
meantime
that
is
a
point
on
which
we
shall
have
to
seek
information
from
our
friend
simpson
since
telephoning
i
have
seen
miss
norman
and
we
have
agreed
to
order
breakfast
for
all
of
us
in
senator
norman
s
rooms
with
simpson
to
serve
us
he
goes
on
duty
again
at
seven
o
clock
and
i
have
asked
that
he
be
sent
here
as
soon
as
he
reports
to
take
a
breakfast
order
why
here
well
he
will
be
more
likely
to
talk
freely
to
you
and
me
alone
than
to
you
and
me
and
miss
norman
to
say
nothing
of
norman
and
if
he
has
played
some
trick
on
us
he
might
refuse
to
go
to
senator
norman
s
suite
but
this
room
will
mean
nothing
to
him
of
course
he
may
not
show
up
at
all
this
morning
ah
there
he
is
i
hope
a
vigorous
knock
had
sounded
at
the
door
it
proved
however
to
be
only
a
porter
with
merriam
s
suit
case
and
hand
bag
for
which
the
industrious
rockwell
had
also
sent
so
early
that
morning
to
the
more
modest
hotel
at
which
merriam
had
been
registered
now
i
can
dress
said
merriam
i
was
afraid
i
should
have
to
turn
waiter
myself
having
only
evening
clothes
to
put
on
yes
get
into
your
things
said
rockwell
and
let
me
think
some
more
this
conspiracy
business
takes
a
lot
more
thinking
than
mere
reform
merriam
hurried
through
a
bath
a
tubful
of
hot
water
early
in
the
morning
was
so
unwonted
a
luxury
to
a
citizen
of
riceville
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
forego
it
even
on
this
occasion
and
began
to
dress
carefully
realising
with
pleasant
excitement
that
he
was
to
have
breakfast
with
mollie
june
he
had
no
more
than
got
into
his
trousers
when
another
knock
came
at
the
door
rockwell
motioned
to
merriam
to
step
into
the
bathroom
and
himself
went
to
the
door
come
in
he
said
and
opened
it
keeping
behind
it
sure
enough
simpson
stepped
into
the
room
with
his
napkin
and
order
pad
rockwell
promptly
closed
the
door
behind
him
locked
it
and
stood
with
his
back
against
it
he
also
pushed
the
switch
for
the
center
chandelier
for
only
the
dim
night
lamp
had
been
on
in
the
sudden
light
simpson
whirled
with
a
startled
and
most
unprofessional
agility
to
face
rockwell
good
morning
simpson
the
waiter
fairly
moistened
his
lips
before
he
could
answer
good
morning
mr
rockwell
the
man
s
face
was
certainly
haggard
his
eyes
even
were
a
trifle
bloodshot
it
was
clear
he
had
had
a
strange
night
but
after
a
moment
of
hostile
confrontation
the
professional
impassivity
of
a
waiter
which
is
perhaps
the
ultimate
perfection
of
descended
about
him
like
a
cloak
and
mask
i
was
sent
to
this
room
wilson
s
room
i
understood
to
take
a
breakfast
order
right
simpson
cried
merriam
cheerily
emerging
from
the
bathroom
in
his
shirt
sleeves
for
a
moment
the
human
gleamed
again
through
the
eyes
of
the
functionary
are
you
mr
wilson
he
asked
his
manner
was
perfect
servility
but
there
was
mockery
and
malice
in
the
tone
yes
simpson
said
merriam
this
morning
i
am
wilson
i
have
read
of
an
english
duke
who
puts
on
a
new
pair
of
trousers
each
morning
but
i
go
him
one
better
i
put
on
an
entire
new
personality
each
morning
very
good
sir
was
the
ironical
reply
to
this
sally
the
grapefruit
is
very
good
this
morning
will
you
have
some
merriam
glanced
at
rockwell
very
likely
we
ll
have
some
said
the
latter
but
we
want
something
else
first
before
the
grapefruit
inquired
simpson
yes
before
the
grapefruit
said
rockwell
a
trifle
sharply
and
what
we
propose
to
have
before
the
grapefruit
is
a
bit
of
talk
with
you
simpson
about
last
night
do
you
care
to
sit
down
he
pointed
to
a
chair
simpson
was
undoubtedly
agitated
but
he
controlled
himself
excellently
he
even
lifted
his
eyebrows
i
hope
i
know
my
place
sir
he
raised
his
pad
and
wrote
on
it
grapefruit
he
said
with
insolent
suavity
for
two
and
then
what
we
have
some
excellent
ham
damn
your
ham
cried
rockwell
he
snatched
the
man
s
pad
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
sit
down
in
that
chair
and
drop
this
damned
pose
we
re
going
to
talk
to
you
man
to
man
but
simpson
only
stooped
and
picked
up
his
pad
rockwell
he
said
i
know
my
place
it
is
a
very
humble
one
it
is
to
take
orders
for
meals
to
be
served
in
this
hotel
so
long
as
that
is
what
you
want
i
am
yours
to
command
but
the
american
citizen
stood
up
in
him
no
european
waiter
could
have
said
it
outside
of
that
i
am
my
own
master
as
much
as
you
are
when
you
call
me
mr
simpson
and
tell
me
to
sit
down
i
don
t
have
to
do
it
and
i
don
t
have
to
talk
of
my
personal
affairs
unless
i
choose
any
more
than
any
one
else
for
an
instant
he
glared
at
rockwell
as
one
angry
man
at
another
his
equal
then
he
quietly
became
the
waiter
again
he
lifted
his
pad
and
poised
his
pencil
shall
we
say
some
ham
rockwell
looked
at
him
a
moment
longer
then
he
laughed
ham
let
it
be
yes
sir
said
simpson
deferentially
writing
and
some
baked
potatoes
perhaps
and
coffee
yes
said
rockwell
and
the
telephone
book
hand
me
the
telephone
book
please
simpson
hesitated
but
this
was
clearly
within
the
line
of
his
duties
yes
sir
he
said
and
stepped
towards
the
stand
on
which
the
book
lay
wait
said
rockwell
perhaps
it
isn
t
necessary
i
think
you
can
tell
me
the
number
i
want
he
paused
a
moment
to
let
this
sink
in
then
miss
alicia
wayward
s
number
i
see
i
shall
have
to
bring
her
here
you
see
he
explained
pleasantly
i
have
locked
the
door
there
are
two
of
us
against
you
he
indicated
merriam
who
still
stood
in
the
bathroom
door
following
the
progress
of
the
interview
with
excited
interest
we
are
going
to
keep
you
here
not
by
any
authority
that
we
as
guests
of
this
hotel
may
have
over
you
as
you
have
very
well
pointed
out
we
have
none
in
such
a
matter
but
by
simple
force
till
miss
wayward
can
come
down
we
shall
see
whether
she
can
make
you
talk
to
merriam
s
astonishment
the
waiter
with
a
sound
somewhere
between
a
sigh
and
a
groan
sank
into
the
chair
which
he
had
thus
far
so
pertinaciously
refused
to
take
for
a
moment
he
stared
at
the
floor
then
he
raised
his
eyes
to
rockwell
what
do
you
want
to
know
that
s
better
said
rockwell
leaving
the
door
and
preparing
to
sit
down
opposite
simpson
will
you
have
a
cigar
simpson
shook
his
head
and
repeated
his
question
what
do
you
want
rockwell
dropped
into
his
chair
and
glancing
at
merriam
pointed
to
another
seat
merriam
was
too
much
excited
to
care
to
sit
down
but
he
came
forward
and
leaned
on
the
back
of
the
chair
we
want
to
know
about
last
night
of
course
said
rockwell
at
five
minutes
to
eight
senator
norman
got
into
the
taxi
which
you
were
driving
at
about
two
o
clock
this
morning
he
tumbled
into
madame
couteau
s
delirious
with
drink
we
want
the
whole
story
of
what
happened
between
eight
and
two
simpson
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
his
hands
on
his
knees
his
order
pad
was
under
one
hand
and
its
flexure
showed
that
he
was
exerting
intense
pressure
his
napkin
dangled
loosely
half
off
his
arm
he
was
looking
at
the
floor
again
he
remained
in
this
position
for
a
number
of
seconds
the
other
two
men
intently
regarding
him
then
he
straightened
up
pushed
himself
farther
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
rockwell
you
shall
have
it
he
said
for
a
moment
he
stared
then
i
hate
senator
norman
enough
to
kill
him
the
reader
will
observe
that
i
use
no
exclamation
points
in
punctuating
simpson
s
sentence
there
were
none
in
his
delivery
of
it
but
it
was
the
more
startling
on
that
account
do
you
know
why
he
unexpectedly
demanded
no
said
rockwell
five
years
ago
i
was
butler
to
wayward
the
you
call
madame
couteau
was
the
parlour
maid
there
her
real
name
is
jennie
higgins
i
was
in
love
with
her
and
she
had
promised
to
marry
me
i
had
a
little
money
saved
up
at
that
time
senator
norman
s
first
wife
was
still
alive
who
was
wayward
s
sister
you
know
miss
wayward
s
aunt
senator
norman
came
often
to
the
house
he
took
a
fancy
to
jennie
and
turned
her
head
the
fact
that
she
was
in
his
own
s
house
made
no
difference
to
him
she
went
off
with
him
on
a
lake
cruise
in
his
yacht
when
they
came
back
he
set
her
up
in
that
flat
and
got
her
work
as
a
manicurist
ever
since
he
has
been
her
paramour
the
odd
word
which
simpson
must
have
gleaned
from
some
novel
came
out
queerly
but
it
served
to
express
his
bitterness
as
no
ordinary
word
could
have
done
that
s
all
a
parlour
maid
ruined
a
butler
cheated
of
his
wife
it
s
nothing
of
course
he
was
looking
down
again
neither
rockwell
nor
merriam
ventured
to
speak
when
he
raised
his
eyes
there
was
a
gleam
in
them
last
night
i
had
him
in
my
power
one
sensed
novels
again
in
my
taxi
not
knowing
who
i
was
i
was
minded
to
kill
him
you
had
told
me
to
drive
him
directly
to
to
jennie
s
not
much
i
drove
as
fast
as
i
dared
out
michigan
avenue
for
a
long
time
he
suspected
nothing
he
thought
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
mayor
s
and
that
was
the
right
direction
but
when
i
turned
into
washington
park
he
got
scared
he
called
through
the
tube
to
know
where
in
hell
i
was
going
i
answered
this
is
simpson
you
can
try
jumping
if
you
like
into
hell
i
put
the
machine
up
to
forty
miles
an
hour
he
opened
the
door
once
but
i
guess
he
didn
t
dare
try
it
he
shut
it
again
of
course
it
was
pure
luck
i
didn
t
get
stopped
for
speeding
but
i
got
through
washington
park
and
across
the
midway
and
out
into
a
lonely
place
at
the
south
end
of
jackson
park
then
i
stopped
and
got
down
and
opened
the
door
and
ordered
him
out
the
man
stopped
when
he
spoke
again
there
was
more
contempt
than
hatred
in
his
voice
the
coward
he
went
down
on
his
knees
on
the
wet
road
and
cried
and
begged
me
not
to
hurt
him
he
said
he
was
sorry
and
he
didn
t
know
i
cared
so
much
and
he
would
make
it
all
right
yet
he
would
give
me
a
lot
of
money
and
get
me
up
in
a
business
and
i
could
marry
jennie
after
all
and
wouldn
t
i
forgive
him
and
go
back
to
town
and
have
a
drink
the
worm
i
could
have
spit
on
him
norman
he
saved
his
life
all
right
he
added
reflectively
if
he
had
showed
fight
i
would
have
strangled
him
and
thrown
his
body
in
the
lake
simpson
shuddered
a
little
but
you
couldn
t
strangle
a
crying
baby
i
kicked
him
once
or
twice
but
what
more
could
i
do
he
kept
begging
me
not
to
hurt
him
but
to
go
back
to
town
and
have
a
drink
that
gave
me
an
idea
i
jerked
him
up
and
pitched
him
into
the
car
and
drove
back
to
a
saloon
we
sat
at
a
table
and
drank
and
he
kept
offering
me
money
and
saying
i
should
marry
jennie
as
if
i
would
take
his
leavings
he
drank
a
lot
i
only
took
one
or
two
to
steady
my
nerves
poured
out
the
rest
but
he
drank
four
or
five
cocktails
then
we
went
on
in
the
taxi
to
another
saloon
and
did
it
again
and
then
to
another
and
about
midnight
we
ended
up
at
a
cheap
dance
hall
on
the
west
side
and
i
turned
him
loose
among
the
roughnecks
and
the
women
there
he
was
pretty
drunk
told
everybody
who
he
was
and
showed
his
money
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
lot
of
the
girls
were
around
him
to
get
the
money
away
from
him
most
of
the
men
they
were
with
didn
t
mind
egged
them
on
pretty
soon
he
had
a
dozen
couples
in
the
bar
with
him
and
was
paying
for
drinks
all
around
but
one
big
foreigner
who
was
with
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
was
ugly
when
norman
after
buying
a
second
round
of
drinks
tried
to
kiss
his
girl
he
roared
out
at
him
and
knocked
him
down
but
norman
only
stumbled
up
again
with
his
lip
bleeding
and
begged
his
pardon
and
handed
the
girl
a
bill
and
bought
drinks
again
and
then
he
got
his
arm
about
another
girl
and
took
her
out
to
dance
it
was
an
hour
before
i
found
him
again
he
was
sitting
on
the
stairs
with
his
collar
off
crazy
drunk
seeing
things
and
all
cleaned
out
as
to
money
i
though
then
he
was
about
ripe
for
what
i
wanted
i
carried
him
downstairs
and
put
him
in
the
taxi
and
drove
to
madame
couteau
s
there
i
carried
him
up
to
her
flat
and
propped
him
against
the
door
and
knocked
and
then
waited
part
way
down
the
stairs
when
the
door
was
opened
he
fell
in
and
i
ran
downstairs
and
took
my
taxi
home
evidently
simpson
had
finished
his
tale
and
it
had
done
him
good
to
tell
it
he
was
much
less
agitated
than
when
he
began
he
looked
steadily
rather
than
angrily
at
rockwell
that
s
the
story
you
wanted
he
said
of
course
now
you
can
get
me
fired
and
blacklisted
it
s
little
i
ll
care
rockwell
had
let
his
cigar
go
out
while
simpson
talked
now
he
lit
it
again
with
a
good
deal
of
deliberation
he
was
evidently
thinking
even
merriam
perceived
the
point
that
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
namely
that
with
norman
still
at
jennie
s
they
had
need
of
simpson
s
silence
and
would
be
likely
to
need
his
help
again
they
must
try
to
conciliate
him
and
win
his
loyal
support
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
do
anything
like
that
rockwell
began
referring
to
simpson
s
defiant
suggestion
i
can
hardly
pronounce
your
conduct
virtuous
but
it
was
very
natural
very
excusable
it
s
lucky
you
did
no
worse
merriam
had
a
sudden
vision
of
the
horrid
predicament
they
would
have
been
in
if
norman
had
actually
been
murdered
in
jackson
park
at
the
very
time
when
he
was
impersonating
him
at
the
hotel
still
continued
rockwell
i
think
you
made
a
mistake
a
mistake
echoed
simpson
do
you
still
love
miss
higgins
what
s
that
to
you
evidently
you
do
why
didn
t
you
take
his
offer
his
money
and
marry
her
it
would
have
been
the
sensible
thing
to
do
and
the
kind
thing
to
her
you
might
be
happy
after
all
of
course
if
you
re
too
stern
a
moralist
the
man
s
face
worked
queerly
it
s
not
that
but
she
wouldn
t
have
a
waiter
now
and
he
wouldn
t
have
done
it
let
her
alone
well
perhaps
not
as
things
stood
but
he
will
now
have
you
seen
the
morning
papers
the
papers
no
sir
if
you
ll
read
them
you
ll
find
that
senator
norman
has
broken
with
all
his
old
life
and
turned
over
a
new
leaf
entirely
which
he
can
t
turn
back
you
have
helped
him
do
it
in
fact
what
s
the
idea
growled
simpson
suspiciously
listen
mr
simpson
rapidly
rockwell
sketched
the
principal
events
which
had
taken
place
at
the
hotel
while
the
waiter
was
driving
his
enemy
about
chicago
merriam
s
impersonation
the
mayor
s
failure
to
veto
the
ordinance
in
time
and
the
necessity
which
both
the
mayor
and
norman
were
now
under
of
breaking
with
the
interests
and
coming
out
as
the
candidates
of
the
reform
league
in
that
rôle
he
concluded
george
norman
will
have
to
lead
a
strictly
virtuous
life
it
will
be
the
business
of
his
friends
and
backers
my
business
for
example
to
see
that
he
does
so
i
will
personally
undertake
to
see
that
you
get
the
money
he
promised
you
all
you
will
have
to
do
is
to
make
it
up
with
jennie
you
may
not
be
able
or
willing
to
do
that
right
away
but
in
a
few
months
there
s
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
be
set
up
in
a
nice
little
business
of
your
own
a
delicatessen
or
caterer
s
or
a
taxicab
firm
or
whatever
you
would
like
in
some
other
city
with
jennie
for
your
wife
will
you
think
it
over
simpson
looked
at
rockwell
and
then
at
merriam
you
certainly
are
as
like
as
two
plates
he
said
irrelevantly
to
the
latter
won
t
you
think
it
over
returned
merriam
as
persuasively
as
if
he
had
been
reasoning
with
some
irate
patron
of
the
riceville
high
school
yes
said
simpson
after
a
bit
i
ll
think
it
over
in
the
meantime
said
rockwell
you
must
keep
still
about
all
this
of
course
and
we
may
need
your
help
again
for
taxi
driving
and
so
forth
what
if
i
choose
to
blow
the
whole
thing
in
that
case
you
will
do
more
than
any
one
else
could
to
help
norman
to
the
thing
he
will
most
want
a
reconciliation
with
crockett
and
the
rest
of
the
gang
and
he
will
go
on
in
his
old
ways
jennie
included
rockwell
let
simpson
digest
that
for
a
moment
and
then
said
well
think
it
over
as
you
have
promised
and
now
we
really
do
want
breakfast
simpson
got
to
his
feet
he
straightened
the
napkin
on
his
arm
and
mechanically
enunciated
his
servile
formula
yes
sir
and
simpson
yes
sir
i
will
talk
with
you
again
this
afternoon
till
then
at
least
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
think
think
sensibly
very
good
sir
waiter
no
bowed
gravely
and
left
the
bedroom
and
when
the
door
closed
behind
simpson
rockwell
and
merriam
naturally
looked
at
each
other
poor
fellow
said
merriam
in
spite
of
himself
his
mind
was
visited
by
a
tantalising
recollection
of
jennie
s
voice
as
it
had
come
to
him
over
the
telephone
with
no
more
evidence
than
that
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
simpson
was
right
in
saying
that
she
would
not
have
a
waiter
now
but
it
was
impossible
to
speak
of
this
to
rockwell
the
latter
had
apparently
dismissed
the
incident
and
was
looking
at
his
watch
it
s
nearly
eight
o
clock
he
said
put
the
rest
of
your
things
on
and
go
down
to
norman
s
rooms
on
the
next
floor
you
re
to
have
breakfast
there
with
miss
norman
and
norman
you
d
better
go
down
the
stairs
rather
than
in
the
elevator
you
will
be
less
likely
to
meet
some
one
who
will
take
you
for
the
senator
i
am
going
to
hunt
up
hobart
the
house
physician
here
and
take
him
with
me
to
this
madame
couteau
s
or
jennie
s
to
see
norman
we
must
get
him
on
his
feet
at
once
a
hotel
physician
will
be
the
very
man
for
that
i
must
shave
said
merriam
oh
never
mind
that
time
is
precious
merriam
thought
of
the
train
which
he
now
planned
to
take
it
left
at
and
would
get
him
to
riceville
a
little
after
noon
he
remembered
too
that
he
must
telegraph
to
his
assistant
principal
that
he
would
miss
the
morning
session
and
he
thought
of
the
coming
breakfast
hour
with
mollie
june
certainly
time
was
precious
to
him
nevertheless
he
said
decidedly
i
m
going
to
shave
all
the
same
rockwell
looked
at
him
with
a
comprehending
smile
all
right
my
boy
said
the
older
man
doubtless
it
s
very
necessary
hurry
up
and
try
not
to
cut
yourself
i
ll
run
along
with
the
doctor
he
moved
to
the
door
stopped
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
to
say
i
shall
probably
drop
in
at
the
rooms
before
you
re
through
breakfast
and
was
gone
merriam
sighed
a
certain
relief
and
went
into
the
bathroom
to
shave
a
few
minutes
later
following
rockwell
s
injunction
he
descended
to
the
floor
below
by
the
stairs
rather
than
the
elevator
he
forgot
even
to
look
at
the
pretty
floor
clerk
on
floor
three
who
last
night
was
wearing
his
norman
s
violets
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
labeled
it
was
the
voice
he
most
desired
to
hear
that
said
come
in
he
opened
the
door
the
room
was
bright
with
morning
sunshine
and
half
way
down
its
length
mollie
june
in
a
blue
satin
breakfast
coat
with
a
lacy
boudoir
cap
covering
her
hair
was
standing
before
the
little
table
which
held
the
bowl
of
roses
good
morning
john
she
said
he
half
perceived
that
her
voice
sounded
tired
and
a
little
sad
but
the
daintiness
of
breakfast
coats
and
boudoir
caps
was
as
strange
in
merriam
s
world
as
white
shoulders
were
his
eyes
drank
it
in
delightfully
in
his
pleasure
her
note
of
sadness
escaped
him
he
answered
almost
gaily
good
morning
mollie
june
his
tone
probably
betrayed
his
mood
and
i
dare
say
mollie
june
guessed
the
reason
for
his
happiness
but
she
ignored
both
mood
and
reason
she
had
turned
back
to
the
roses
come
and
help
me
she
said
these
flowers
must
have
fresh
water
merriam
pushed
the
door
shut
behind
him
and
advanced
rapidly
i
am
almost
afraid
he
might
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
but
mollie
june
was
already
half
way
across
the
room
with
the
roses
to
lay
them
on
a
newspaper
which
she
had
previously
spread
on
the
seat
of
a
chair
so
all
that
merriam
got
his
hands
on
was
the
bowl
empty
it
in
there
said
mollie
june
indicating
the
bathroom
between
the
sitting
room
and
norman
s
empty
bedroom
and
fill
it
with
cold
water
thankful
that
no
reply
was
immediately
demanded
merriam
did
as
he
was
bid
when
he
reëntered
the
sitting
room
with
the
fresh
water
mollie
june
stooped
over
the
chair
gathered
up
the
roses
and
came
towards
him
set
it
back
in
the
same
place
she
said
merriam
did
so
and
she
came
up
to
him
that
is
to
say
to
the
bowl
and
inserted
the
stems
all
together
and
with
her
pink
fingers
wet
from
the
cool
water
deftly
arranged
the
blossoms
then
drying
her
finger
tips
on
a
very
small
handkerchief
she
turned
and
raised
her
eyes
to
him
gravely
he
saw
at
last
that
she
was
pale
that
she
had
been
wakeful
perhaps
she
had
been
crying
in
sudden
concern
he
stood
dumb
did
you
sleep
well
she
asked
he
mustered
his
forces
to
reply
i
am
afraid
i
did
he
said
ashamed
she
looked
at
him
forgivingly
of
course
you
must
have
been
dreadfully
tired
she
said
i
hardly
slept
at
all
she
added
i
am
terribly
worried
about
george
we
didn
t
even
know
where
he
was
until
a
little
while
ago
evidently
rockwell
had
already
reported
some
part
at
least
of
simpson
s
disclosure
for
a
moment
they
stood
silent
tacitly
avoiding
reference
to
george
norman
s
ascertained
whereabouts
then
mollie
june
raised
her
eyes
again
i
m
worried
too
about
what
we
did
last
night
we
mustn
t
do
so
again
she
met
his
eyes
very
serious
no
merriam
assented
i
can
t
call
you
mr
merriam
though
she
cried
and
i
mustn
t
call
you
i
ve
decided
to
call
you
mr
john
thank
you
said
merriam
gravely
he
was
deeply
touched
by
the
unconscious
confession
mollie
june
turned
away
i
must
tell
aunt
mary
you
are
here
just
then
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
hall
door
for
an
instant
the
boy
and
girl
stared
at
each
other
as
though
in
guilty
alarm
merriam
started
to
go
to
the
door
but
mollie
june
had
recovered
her
wits
no
she
said
you
must
be
careful
about
being
seen
sit
there
she
pointed
to
the
armchair
which
still
faced
the
gas
log
between
the
windows
at
the
end
of
the
room
farthest
from
the
hall
i
ll
see
who
it
is
it
proved
to
be
no
one
more
dangerous
than
simpson
who
with
an
assistant
was
prepared
to
set
up
a
table
in
the
sitting
room
and
serve
the
grapefruit
and
even
while
mollie
june
was
bidding
him
come
in
aunt
mary
entered
from
the
bedroom
with
her
was
miss
alicia
wayward
apparently
much
excited
with
her
hands
full
of
newspapers
merriam
stood
up
and
alicia
catching
sight
of
him
dropped
on
the
floor
the
paper
she
held
in
her
right
hand
and
advanced
with
an
air
of
eagerness
oh
she
began
then
as
merriam
took
her
hand
she
stopped
short
in
her
sentence
laughed
and
said
who
are
you
this
morning
merriam
whom
alicia
always
stimulated
to
play
up
bowed
over
her
hand
as
elegantly
as
he
could
and
replied
senator
norman
i
believe
at
your
service
good
morning
miss
norman
he
added
politely
to
the
older
woman
aunt
mary
merely
nodded
rather
grimly
and
turned
away
as
if
to
inspect
simpson
s
preparation
of
the
breakfast
table
merriam
wondered
how
much
of
simpson
s
confession
rockwell
had
found
time
to
report
to
her
but
alicia
gave
him
little
time
for
speculation
well
senator
she
rejoined
withdrawing
her
hand
you
were
always
conscious
when
alicia
gave
her
hand
and
when
she
withdrew
it
you
and
the
mayor
have
made
quite
a
noise
in
the
world
this
morning
see
she
displayed
the
newspaper
which
she
still
held
in
her
left
hand
it
was
one
of
the
leading
chicago
dailies
which
invariably
prints
one
bold
black
headline
across
the
top
of
the
entire
front
page
the
topic
may
be
a
world
war
or
a
dog
fight
but
the
headline
is
always
there
in
the
same
size
and
startling
blackness
of
type
this
morning
it
read
black
signs
and
one
of
the
columns
below
carried
the
further
head
mayor
and
senator
norman
reported
to
have
broken
with
traction
oh
exclaimed
mollie
june
who
had
approached
and
read
these
captions
she
looked
at
merriam
with
eyes
i
surmise
that
the
newspaper
headlines
gave
her
as
indeed
they
gave
to
merriam
himself
the
first
actual
realisation
of
the
public
interest
attaching
to
what
they
had
really
felt
to
be
a
little
private
drama
of
their
own
aunt
mary
had
joined
them
black
has
definitely
signed
it
you
see
she
said
with
a
touch
of
triumph
in
her
tone
it
appeared
that
the
mayor
had
not
gone
to
the
council
meeting
at
all
and
the
paper
did
not
fail
to
point
out
that
the
ordinance
had
become
law
without
his
signature
under
the
provisions
of
the
city
charter
at
nine
o
clock
but
late
in
the
evening
shortly
before
the
council
adjourned
the
document
had
arrived
by
a
messenger
with
the
mayor
s
signature
attached
reporters
had
immediately
set
out
in
relentless
pursuit
and
had
routed
the
mayor
out
of
bed
at
his
house
between
twelve
and
one
o
clock
and
obtained
a
brief
interview
the
substance
of
which
was
that
the
public
interest
of
the
city
demanded
the
improved
conditions
which
the
new
law
would
insure
and
that
he
was
proud
to
complete
with
his
approval
the
action
of
the
councilmen
in
passing
it
the
rest
was
mere
rumour
and
speculation
interlarded
with
many
prudent
it
is
said
s
but
it
seemed
that
some
if
not
all
of
it
must
have
been
inspired
by
the
mayor
it
was
said
that
an
important
representative
of
the
traction
interests
had
seen
senator
norman
in
his
rooms
at
the
hotel
de
soto
early
in
the
evening
and
pleaded
with
him
the
cause
of
the
interested
bondholders
and
stockholders
whose
investments
would
be
imperilled
by
the
changes
involved
but
that
he
had
stood
firm
on
the
ground
of
the
public
welfare
it
was
said
too
that
later
mayor
black
had
had
a
long
conference
with
the
senator
well
it
been
rather
long
and
that
they
had
agreed
that
the
interests
of
the
plain
people
of
chicago
must
at
all
costs
decide
the
issue
it
was
said
finally
that
both
senator
norman
and
mayor
black
would
probably
join
forces
with
the
reform
league
whose
program
they
had
finally
so
powerfully
supported
in
demanding
and
obtaining
other
needed
improvements
in
municipal
conditions
from
all
of
which
it
seemed
to
be
clear
that
the
mayor
having
taken
an
hour
or
so
to
think
over
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
had
become
convinced
of
the
soundness
of
aunt
mary
s
logic
and
had
decided
without
waiting
for
any
further
communication
from
the
norman
camp
to
claim
the
credit
for
the
ordinance
and
appeal
for
popular
support
thereon
taking
care
however
to
involve
senator
norman
s
name
so
that
the
real
norman
should
be
compelled
to
join
forces
with
him
in
his
new
departure
by
the
time
the
column
of
news
and
comment
and
a
brief
and
cautious
editorial
on
the
occurrence
had
been
read
out
by
alicia
and
one
or
two
other
papers
glanced
at
simpson
had
set
up
and
laid
his
table
and
had
his
first
course
served
he
respectfully
approached
and
inquired
if
they
were
ready
for
breakfast
certainly
said
aunt
mary
merriam
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
half
past
eight
i
ought
to
send
my
telegram
to
riceville
first
he
said
to
let
them
know
i
shall
be
there
on
the
noon
train
after
the
grapefruit
said
aunt
mary
with
a
decided
note
in
her
voice
which
led
merriam
to
look
at
her
inquiringly
but
he
desired
to
exhibit
the
coolness
of
a
man
of
the
world
to
whom
telegrams
were
customary
incidents
of
daily
living
and
who
habitually
ran
close
to
the
wind
in
the
matter
of
trains
so
he
acquiesced
with
a
bookish
as
you
please
and
moved
with
the
others
to
the
table
simpson
had
decorated
the
center
of
the
board
with
one
of
the
hotel
s
slim
glass
vases
holding
a
couple
of
pink
carnations
mollie
june
regarded
this
ornament
with
disfavour
let
s
have
the
roses
instead
john
she
said
and
merriam
to
the
scandal
of
simpson
himself
removed
the
carnations
and
set
the
bowl
of
roses
in
their
place
they
said
little
over
the
grapefruit
alicia
added
a
few
humorous
comments
on
points
in
the
newspaper
article
but
aunt
mary
was
divided
between
an
anxious
and
a
curious
questioning
scrutiny
of
merriam
and
merriam
was
distracted
between
a
suppressed
worry
over
his
telegram
and
approaching
train
time
and
the
delight
of
stolen
glances
at
mrs
senator
norman
as
for
mrs
senator
norman
she
devoted
herself
chiefly
to
the
fruit
once
or
twice
in
looking
up
she
almost
unavoidably
intercepted
one
of
merriam
s
guilty
glances
when
this
happened
she
met
his
eyes
frankly
but
with
a
gravity
that
was
pathetically
forgivingly
rebuking
presently
simpson
was
removing
the
fruit
rinds
and
placing
finger
bowls
merriam
looked
quickly
at
his
watch
again
and
spoke
to
the
waiter
bring
me
a
telegraph
form
please
aunt
mary
s
instantly
vanished
what
message
are
you
going
to
send
she
asked
in
a
restrained
voice
missed
night
train
will
arrive
at
noon
no
said
aunt
mary
merriam
she
pursued
quickly
until
george
is
brought
back
here
you
must
stay
after
all
this
in
the
papers
this
morning
there
will
be
scores
of
people
to
see
him
he
is
known
to
be
a
late
riser
and
never
sees
any
one
before
ten
or
they
would
have
been
here
before
this
in
a
very
few
minutes
they
will
begin
to
come
we
will
put
off
most
of
them
of
course
but
there
are
likely
to
be
some
whom
we
can
t
put
off
we
can
t
tell
where
george
is
and
we
can
t
say
we
don
t
know
where
he
is
and
there
will
be
one
or
two
to
whom
we
can
t
say
we
won
t
tell
where
he
is
we
must
have
you
in
reserve
you
shall
go
to
bed
in
george
s
room
ill
with
with
lumbago
hobart
will
attend
you
when
absolutely
necessary
we
can
show
a
man
into
the
room
and
you
can
say
a
few
words
i
will
tell
you
what
to
say
in
each
case
you
can
have
your
head
half
way
under
the
covers
and
can
make
your
voice
weak
and
husky
you
will
be
safe
enough
from
detection
then
by
this
evening
at
the
latest
we
shall
bring
george
back
and
you
can
go
down
to
riceville
on
the
night
train
you
will
only
have
missed
one
day
and
you
will
have
saved
us
from
a
most
serious
dilemma
there
was
an
appeal
in
the
elderly
woman
s
voice
to
which
merriam
was
not
insensible
though
the
pull
of
habitual
regularity
at
his
school
was
strong
in
him
it
is
to
be
feared
that
alicia
spoiled
aunt
mary
s
effect
across
the
table
from
merriam
she
was
partly
hidden
from
him
by
the
flowers
but
she
leaned
forward
bringing
her
face
almost
beside
the
roses
and
spoke
in
her
most
honeyed
tones
oh
do
merriam
how
can
you
resist
it
she
added
if
i
were
a
man
and
had
the
chance
to
be
mollie
june
s
husband
even
for
a
day
she
stopped
with
her
archest
smile
mollie
june
with
possibly
the
slightest
augmentation
of
colour
brought
forward
a
practical
argument
since
you
will
miss
the
morning
anyway
it
won
t
much
matter
if
you
miss
the
whole
day
you
haven
t
but
one
class
in
the
afternoon
have
you
only
senior
algebra
said
merriam
miss
eldon
can
take
that
i
suppose
she
could
said
merriam
who
was
realising
that
on
this
particular
day
advanced
algebra
would
be
to
him
the
most
distasteful
of
all
branches
of
human
learning
then
you
ll
stay
and
help
us
mr
john
the
reader
will
perceive
that
this
simple
appeal
was
really
much
superior
to
any
which
the
too
sophisticated
and
calculating
alicia
could
contrive
a
touch
of
wistfulness
came
into
mollie
june
s
face
with
the
word
help
his
high
promise
of
the
night
before
was
irresistibly
recalled
and
john
reminded
him
of
the
delightfulness
of
fresh
water
for
roses
and
of
the
unconscious
confession
which
her
compromise
name
for
him
had
implied
alicia
discreetly
retired
behind
the
roses
and
aunt
mary
waited
with
lips
somewhat
grimly
pursed
then
while
merriam
hesitated
with
his
eyes
on
mollie
june
s
face
we
must
suppose
that
he
was
weighing
her
very
practical
argument
the
telephone
rang
simpson
with
telegraph
blanks
in
his
hand
answered
it
and
reported
that
rockwell
wished
to
speak
to
senator
norman
this
is
norman
said
merriam
cautiously
into
the
telephone
ah
said
rockwell
s
voice
well
you
ll
be
pleased
to
learn
that
you
are
quieter
you
aren
t
seeing
things
any
more
i
m
not
sure
of
that
thought
merriam
but
you
he
has
a
severe
cold
fever
and
a
cough
touch
of
bronchitis
probably
hobart
says
he
can
t
possibly
be
moved
till
anyway
i
don
t
see
how
we
could
get
him
into
the
hotel
till
then
you
must
stay
merriam
all
right
said
merriam
surprising
his
interlocutor
by
his
ready
acquiescence
i
ll
stay
good
i
ll
be
down
at
the
hotel
in
half
an
hour
rockwell
rang
off
merriam
turned
to
face
the
three
women
when
aunt
mary
heard
the
news
about
george
she
held
out
her
hand
to
simpson
for
the
telegraph
forms
and
wrote
in
a
moment
she
read
ill
with
a
touch
of
bronchitis
hope
to
be
back
john
will
that
do
i
suppose
so
he
assented
his
words
were
almost
drowned
by
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
our
day
has
begun
said
aunt
mary
rising
with
admirable
composure
she
handed
the
telegram
to
simpson
send
it
at
once
into
the
bedroom
merriam
get
into
bed
as
soon
as
you
can
you
have
bronchitis
you
know
not
lumbago
but
before
merriam
could
obey
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
change
of
the
man
who
thus
burst
into
senator
norman
s
sitting
room
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
was
an
unpleasant
but
important
personage
none
other
than
thompson
one
never
thought
of
calling
him
norman
s
private
political
manager
in
all
matters
that
involved
handling
the
people
s
vote
he
was
a
short
stoutish
belligerent
type
about
with
thin
untidy
hair
a
thin
untidy
moustache
and
somewhere
between
the
moustache
and
the
hair
a
pair
of
small
blue
eyes
which
seemed
incapable
of
any
other
expressions
than
aggressiveness
and
anger
senator
norman
the
real
norman
had
long
found
him
nearly
as
disagreeable
as
the
reader
will
find
him
but
so
useful
in
many
political
contingencies
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
bring
himself
to
dispense
with
him
having
popped
explosively
into
the
room
thompson
stopped
short
at
sight
of
the
three
women
for
the
first
instant
or
two
he
did
not
notice
merriam
who
had
quietly
slipped
into
the
great
armchair
that
faced
the
gas
log
with
his
back
almost
squarely
to
the
room
good
morning
thompson
said
aunt
mary
we
were
just
having
breakfast
alicia
and
mollie
june
still
sat
at
the
table
and
simpson
stood
a
little
at
one
side
thompson
knew
who
the
two
girls
were
and
they
knew
who
he
was
but
he
had
never
been
presented
in
norman
s
family
except
to
miss
norman
a
fact
which
he
resented
keenly
so
they
did
not
speak
alicia
sat
back
in
her
chair
and
stared
insolently
while
mollie
june
leaned
forward
and
rearranged
a
rose
in
the
bowl
i
m
sorry
to
break
in
this
way
thompson
said
even
he
was
slightly
abashed
but
i
ve
got
to
speak
to
the
senator
come
back
a
little
later
thompson
ventured
merriam
in
a
hoarse
whisper
the
was
a
false
note
and
its
effect
was
to
anger
thompson
no
he
cried
the
pugnacious
gleam
that
was
never
far
below
the
surface
of
his
little
eyes
appearing
in
them
i
ve
got
to
speak
to
you
now
i
ve
got
a
right
to
he
advanced
he
would
have
passed
the
table
so
as
to
approach
merriam
but
there
was
only
a
narrow
space
on
either
side
of
it
and
in
one
of
those
avenues
stood
simpson
behind
alicia
while
aunt
mary
had
quietly
moved
into
the
other
standing
with
her
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
in
which
merriam
had
been
sitting
so
thompson
found
himself
barricaded
as
it
were
and
stopped
short
and
shouted
across
the
table
and
over
the
head
of
mollie
june
what
in
what
s
the
meaning
of
all
this
this
stuff
in
the
papers
thompson
s
difficulty
in
expressing
himself
under
the
handicap
of
the
interdiction
against
profanity
imposed
by
the
presence
of
the
women
was
a
trifle
ludicrous
but
his
tone
and
manner
were
almost
as
bad
as
an
oath
would
have
been
alicia
s
eyebrows
rose
she
rose
herself
perhaps
we
had
better
withdraw
she
said
if
merriam
who
had
never
seen
her
in
any
other
than
a
gracious
and
seductive
mood
could
have
turned
his
head
to
look
he
would
have
marvelled
at
her
freezing
disdain
mollie
june
imitated
her
in
rising
and
in
a
more
youthful
hauteur
without
waiting
for
any
reply
alicia
turned
and
walked
into
the
bedroom
and
mollie
june
followed
but
feminine
disdain
however
magnificent
had
little
effect
on
thompson
he
was
obviously
relieved
he
looked
at
aunt
mary
plainly
desiring
that
she
should
go
too
no
i
think
i
ll
remain
thompson
she
said
pleasantly
then
he
looked
at
simpson
and
the
latter
cast
an
inquiring
glance
at
aunt
mary
you
may
stay
please
simpson
said
she
we
shall
be
finishing
our
breakfast
presently
before
thompson
could
digest
this
snub
alicia
reëntered
from
the
bedroom
she
carried
a
white
knitted
wool
scarf
with
which
she
went
to
merriam
don
t
you
feel
chilly
george
she
asked
you
can
t
be
too
careful
with
that
throat
she
knelt
down
by
his
chair
put
the
scarf
over
his
head
brought
it
down
past
his
cheeks
tied
it
loosely
under
his
chin
and
threw
the
ends
back
over
his
shoulders
now
lean
back
isn
t
that
better
norman
has
a
severe
cold
she
said
in
the
general
direction
of
thompson
the
doctor
is
afraid
of
bronchitis
she
added
as
she
rose
and
drew
the
shades
that
light
is
getting
too
bright
for
your
eyes
she
flashed
a
glance
at
aunt
mary
and
returned
to
the
bedroom
merriam
had
been
feeling
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
minutes
before
thompson
whoever
thompson
might
be
would
somehow
force
his
way
to
his
side
and
look
down
into
his
face
and
probably
perceive
the
imposture
as
mayor
black
had
done
but
now
with
the
welcome
aid
of
the
scarf
he
had
the
bravado
to
turn
partly
in
his
chair
and
say
throatily
what
do
you
want
thompson
had
remained
a
gaping
spectator
of
the
tying
up
of
merriam
s
head
but
this
question
enabled
him
to
recover
his
natural
aggressiveness
with
one
defiant
glance
at
aunt
mary
he
started
forward
and
pushed
his
way
past
simpson
who
could
have
stopped
him
only
by
an
actual
physical
offensive
what
do
i
want
he
repeated
sarcastically
as
he
stood
looking
down
on
the
senatorial
head
bundled
in
the
scarf
i
want
to
know
what
the
hell
you
ve
gone
and
done
you
and
black
without
letting
anybody
know
you
were
going
to
what
about
crockett
didn
t
you
promise
him
at
eight
o
clock
last
night
that
you
would
tell
black
to
veto
and
then
this
thompson
had
drawn
a
folded
newspaper
from
his
coat
pocket
he
struck
it
with
his
other
hand
is
that
the
way
to
treat
your
friends
who
ve
stuck
by
you
what
about
the
election
next
week
what
about
the
state
machine
what
about
your
campaign
fund
have
you
gone
nutty
did
you
really
do
it
or
is
the
mayor
lying
that
s
what
i
want
to
know
what
business
is
it
of
yours
asked
the
victim
of
this
torrent
of
questions
as
he
stared
from
between
the
folds
of
his
woolen
scarf
at
the
unlighted
gas
log
merriam
really
was
asking
for
information
but
the
politician
could
not
know
this
it
seemed
to
him
the
last
insult
and
repudiation
he
fell
back
a
step
dramatically
so
that
s
it
he
cried
after
i
ve
managed
two
campaigns
for
you
i
ve
done
your
dirty
work
for
ten
years
and
now
over
night
what
business
is
it
of
mine
you
throw
me
over
and
all
your
friends
the
men
who
sent
you
to
the
senate
of
the
united
states
and
kept
you
there
and
what
for
to
join
that
fool
black
and
the
reform
league
i
suppose
philip
rockwell
and
his
gang
of
preachers
and
women
and
mollycoddles
you
ll
appeal
to
the
dear
people
bah
thompson
had
by
this
time
apparently
forgotten
entirely
the
presence
of
aunt
mary
and
simpson
he
snatched
a
cigar
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
bit
the
end
off
it
produced
a
match
from
somewhere
and
lighted
it
emitting
volumes
of
smoke
he
thumped
with
his
newspaper
on
the
arm
of
merriam
s
chair
and
in
an
impressively
lowered
tone
continued
listen
to
me
it
won
t
do
senator
you
can
t
get
away
with
it
not
you
reform
and
the
people
and
pure
politics
and
all
that
if
you
d
started
in
on
that
line
twenty
years
ago
may
be
i
don
t
say
it
couldn
t
be
made
to
pay
but
not
by
you
at
this
time
of
day
it
s
too
late
you
ve
tied
up
with
the
other
gang
they
know
you
they
know
too
much
about
you
they
won
t
let
you
do
it
it
s
no
use
trying
of
course
if
you
re
tired
of
your
job
if
you
re
hankering
to
quit
if
you
want
to
go
down
in
a
grand
smash
all
right
but
if
you
want
to
stay
in
the
united
states
senate
there
s
just
one
way
you
can
do
it
and
that
s
to
play
the
old
game
in
the
old
way
with
the
old
crowd
savez
all
this
was
a
trifle
hard
on
young
merriam
thompson
had
told
who
he
was
so
that
the
boy
realised
the
critical
character
of
the
interview
but
there
was
so
much
else
he
needed
to
know
how
had
the
real
norman
been
in
the
habit
of
treating
this
man
how
would
he
probably
have
acted
in
such
a
situation
as
they
were
pretending
the
only
thing
he
could
do
was
to
say
as
little
as
possible
now
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
some
response
what
he
said
was
we
ll
see
about
that
thompson
was
rather
encouraged
than
otherwise
by
this
remark
he
had
not
of
course
expected
any
immediate
acquiescence
you
ll
see
all
right
if
you
keep
on
he
retorted
with
elephantine
irony
but
for
god
s
sake
senator
try
to
see
things
in
time
it
s
not
too
late
yet
turn
the
mayor
down
you
aren
t
committed
openly
he
is
but
you
aren
t
let
him
go
smash
alone
he
was
always
a
fool
you
can
swear
to
crockett
that
you
told
black
to
veto
it
don
t
matter
whether
he
believes
you
or
not
he
ll
take
you
back
this
ordinance
business
don
t
matter
they
ll
fix
that
some
way
there
are
bigger
things
than
that
coming
and
they
know
how
useful
you
can
be
you
can
t
keep
on
with
this
other
can
t
i
asked
merriam
not
unskillfully
fishing
for
further
revelations
listen
to
me
senator
didn
t
you
accept
fifty
thousand
dollars
of
common
stock
in
the
united
traction
companies
are
you
going
to
give
that
back
will
crockett
you
give
it
back
not
he
have
you
forgotten
how
we
cornered
the
vote
in
kankakee
county
when
you
ran
six
years
ago
crockett
knows
about
that
the
whole
crowd
know
it
and
what
about
that
nice
little
honorarium
you
received
for
your
vote
in
the
senate
on
the
last
amendment
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
if
you
ve
forgotten
it
the
men
who
put
it
up
haven
t
do
you
think
they
ll
let
you
go
off
like
this
as
long
as
you
play
the
game
and
keep
your
good
looks
and
can
make
your
popular
speeches
they
ll
keep
you
in
the
senate
and
the
good
things
will
come
your
way
they
ll
get
you
a
cabinet
job
if
you
want
it
just
say
the
word
but
if
you
throw
them
over
they
ll
turn
on
you
these
little
things
i
ve
been
reminding
you
of
will
leak
out
man
alive
you
re
liable
to
end
in
the
pen
perhaps
said
merriam
but
i
shouldn
t
go
alone
a
man
named
thompson
would
go
with
me
eh
and
maybe
even
crockett
and
others
i
might
name
merriam
wished
he
name
them
that
for
your
threats
he
finished
grandly
and
snapped
his
fingers
thanking
heaven
for
the
rôle
of
villain
he
had
enacted
in
a
certain
college
melodrama
in
connection
with
which
he
had
by
diligent
practice
acquired
the
not
common
art
of
snapping
one
s
fingers
effectively
thompson
who
had
unwontedly
removed
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
at
merriam
s
speech
now
backed
away
from
the
huddled
figure
you
think
you
d
do
that
he
said
in
a
voice
in
which
cynical
scorn
contended
with
something
a
little
like
fright
not
unless
i
am
forced
to
said
merriam
but
i
have
chosen
a
new
course
and
i
mean
to
follow
it
but
thompson
standing
solidly
in
the
spot
to
which
he
had
retreated
as
if
he
had
dug
in
there
restored
his
cigar
to
the
accustomed
corner
of
his
face
and
narrowed
his
little
eyes
till
they
were
hideously
smaller
than
usual
it
s
unfortunate
senator
he
said
with
a
kind
of
exaggerated
suavity
that
this
reform
in
your
public
morals
last
night
was
not
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
change
in
your
private
morals
what
do
you
mean
asked
merriam
quickly
and
his
voice
faltered
ever
so
little
a
fact
which
the
other
did
not
miss
oh
you
were
known
you
know
at
reiberg
s
place
you
told
everybody
who
you
were
i
understand
you
must
have
been
pretty
gay
celebrating
your
new
virtue
i
suppose
but
handing
bills
to
girls
isn
t
quite
the
line
for
a
reform
league
hero
senator
and
we
know
where
you
went
afterwards
she
s
a
pretty
little
thing
but
she
s
not
in
the
reform
league
picture
suppose
we
say
nothing
about
the
united
traction
stock
or
the
kankakee
county
vote
or
the
interstate
commerce
business
or
any
other
little
incidents
of
the
past
like
that
but
just
start
with
this
little
affair
of
last
night
how
will
that
mix
with
pure
politics
senator
it
was
thompson
s
turn
to
enjoy
himself
he
could
not
refrain
from
following
up
this
new
vein
your
old
friends
are
senator
but
your
new
friends
the
great
american
people
are
a
little
inclined
to
be
narrow
in
matters
of
private
morality
thompson
s
attack
was
a
mistake
it
gave
merriam
time
to
think
and
decide
upon
his
course
i
was
at
reiberg
s
last
night
he
said
recovering
his
loftiness
and
adding
coldness
thereto
nor
anywhere
else
i
spent
the
night
in
this
hotel
thompson
stared
for
a
moment
it
almost
seemed
that
his
jaw
would
fall
and
his
precious
cigar
drop
out
but
he
recovered
himself
with
a
sneer
you
did
did
you
in
the
company
of
your
wife
i
suppose
and
that
thing
about
your
head
is
really
to
keep
you
from
catching
cold
and
not
to
keep
your
head
from
splitting
open
with
the
headache
you
re
pretty
fresh
this
morning
considering
i
hand
it
to
you
there
but
his
rising
anger
got
the
better
of
his
unnatural
affectation
of
suavity
which
he
had
maintained
up
to
the
limit
of
his
endurance
but
that
lie
won
t
go
you
don
t
know
what
you
did
last
night
you
were
stewed
right
you
told
every
tom
dick
and
harry
and
mary
and
jane
at
the
dance
hall
that
you
were
senator
norman
you
fool
after
that
said
merriam
playing
his
part
regally
or
let
us
say
senatorially
i
can
only
suggest
to
you
that
behind
you
is
a
door
which
i
wish
you
would
make
use
of
as
soon
as
possible
thompson
seemed
decidedly
nonplused
at
this
the
real
norman
had
always
been
amenable
to
threats
and
on
the
whole
patient
under
abuse
do
you
mean
he
burst
out
that
i
m
not
to
be
your
manager
you
turn
me
down
cold
at
this
juncture
there
came
a
quick
light
knock
at
the
door
to
which
merriam
had
just
referred
so
grandly
simpson
looked
quickly
at
aunt
mary
and
then
at
merriam
let
me
know
who
it
is
said
the
latter
realising
that
he
must
seem
to
be
in
command
when
simpson
opened
the
door
it
was
rockwell
who
pushed
past
him
he
stopped
short
before
thompson
with
his
cigar
in
hostile
confrontation
cautiously
merriam
peered
around
the
off
side
of
his
high
backed
chair
thompson
he
said
you
know
rockwell
i
believe
my
new
manager
for
a
moment
thompson
stood
once
his
mouth
opened
almost
certainly
to
frame
an
oath
it
is
strange
evidence
of
the
survival
of
chivalry
in
american
life
that
aunt
mary
s
presence
restrained
that
outburst
instead
we
must
suppose
he
took
the
stub
of
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
dashed
it
on
the
carpet
i
m
through
he
said
then
to
merriam
i
ll
use
your
door
all
right
for
the
last
time
till
you
send
for
me
he
caught
up
his
hat
and
walked
past
rockwell
within
an
inch
of
brushing
against
him
but
not
looking
at
him
at
the
door
he
turned
you
ve
read
your
morning
papers
i
suppose
have
you
read
take
a
look
at
it
the
door
slammed
behind
him
the
the
reverberation
of
thompson
s
slamming
still
echoed
in
the
room
when
the
bedroom
door
opened
and
alicia
sailed
in
followed
more
demurely
by
mollie
june
good
morning
philip
said
alicia
to
her
fiancé
then
she
turned
to
merriam
oh
you
did
splendidly
she
cried
did
i
said
merriam
awkwardly
trying
to
get
the
woolen
scarf
off
his
head
indeed
you
did
we
listened
to
every
word
i
through
the
keyhole
and
mollie
june
lay
down
on
the
floor
and
listened
under
the
door
it
was
mean
of
me
to
take
the
keyhole
but
i
m
too
old
and
fat
for
the
other
position
possibly
mollie
june
s
recent
prostration
accounted
for
the
color
in
her
cheeks
help
him
off
with
that
thing
dear
alicia
added
and
herself
advanced
to
rockwell
and
took
his
hands
offering
to
be
kissed
an
offer
of
which
rockwell
took
advantage
with
some
fervour
yes
i
ll
help
you
said
mollie
june
moving
somewhat
timidly
in
merriam
s
direction
he
met
her
more
than
half
way
please
he
said
i
m
all
bound
round
with
a
woolen
string
mollie
june
drew
the
ends
of
the
scarf
down
off
his
shoulders
and
untied
the
loose
knot
under
his
chin
there
she
said
looking
up
at
him
merriam
snatched
the
thing
off
his
head
ruffling
his
hair
thank
you
rockwell
s
voice
reached
them
across
the
room
aunt
mary
had
been
hurriedly
narrating
the
happenings
with
thompson
he
now
looked
approvingly
at
merriam
that
s
all
right
he
said
reflectively
very
good
yes
just
as
well
to
defy
him
at
once
could
hardly
have
been
better
ah
there
s
hobart
now
i
suppose
for
a
discreet
knock
had
sounded
at
the
hall
door
rockwell
himself
admitted
the
house
physician
a
bald
youngish
man
with
nose
glasses
over
slightly
shifty
eyes
and
a
quite
unprofessional
manner
the
manner
of
a
smart
young
business
man
merriam
and
mollie
june
joined
the
others
for
the
introductions
these
formalities
over
hobart
confirmed
the
report
of
norman
s
condition
which
rockwell
had
given
them
over
the
telephone
he
was
getting
along
all
right
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
mollie
june
except
for
a
touch
of
bronchitis
mollie
june
betrayed
an
embarrassed
uneasiness
merriam
wondered
just
how
much
she
knew
of
her
husband
s
whereabouts
of
his
escapades
in
general
very
well
said
aunt
mary
briskly
you
must
go
right
to
bed
merriam
before
some
one
else
comes
you
re
ill
with
bronchitis
of
course
that
scarf
was
a
splendid
idea
alicia
but
it
was
a
close
shave
we
mustn
t
run
any
more
risks
you
will
attend
him
dr
hobart
of
course
said
the
young
physician
evidently
much
amused
rockwell
has
told
me
the
story
it
s
as
good
as
a
play
merriam
i
mean
senator
i
order
you
to
bed
at
once
very
well
said
merriam
and
turned
towards
senator
norman
s
bedroom
i
ll
show
you
where
things
are
said
rockwell
accompanying
him
i
explored
a
bit
last
night
in
the
bedroom
with
the
door
closed
behind
them
merriam
hesitated
better
get
your
things
off
at
once
said
rockwell
going
to
the
bureau
and
stooping
to
open
the
bottom
drawer
it
s
nearly
ten
o
clock
he
continued
rummaging
the
reporters
will
be
here
any
minute
i
m
surprised
some
enterprising
chap
hasn
t
arrived
already
we
ll
try
to
keep
them
off
of
course
but
some
of
those
fellows
are
mighty
clever
here
we
are
pajamas
he
added
pulling
out
the
garments
for
which
he
had
been
searching
then
he
crossed
to
a
closet
from
which
in
a
moment
he
emerged
with
a
bath
robe
and
a
pair
of
bedroom
slippers
i
ll
put
these
by
the
bed
so
that
if
there
s
any
reason
for
you
to
get
up
you
can
do
so
easily
but
unless
something
happens
to
change
our
plans
you
re
much
too
sick
to
get
up
a
knock
sounded
at
the
door
into
the
sitting
room
rockwell
answered
it
and
returned
grinning
aunt
mary
says
that
simpson
shall
bring
you
some
ham
and
a
cup
of
coffee
as
soon
as
you
re
in
bed
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
you
have
had
nothing
to
eat
but
grapefruit
i
had
forgotten
said
merriam
realising
nevertheless
that
he
was
very
hungry
rockwell
dropped
into
a
comfortable
chair
it
s
rather
good
fun
he
said
this
conspiracy
business
i
do
hope
we
can
pull
it
through
by
this
time
merriam
was
inside
the
senatorial
pajamas
he
approached
the
bed
turned
down
the
covers
and
awkwardly
climbed
in
feeling
for
all
the
world
like
a
little
boy
who
has
been
sent
to
bed
in
the
daytime
for
being
naughty
now
about
lights
said
rockwell
rising
the
window
shades
had
not
been
raised
they
were
using
the
chandelier
not
these
center
lights
nor
the
night
lamp
both
are
too
bright
on
your
face
in
case
let
s
try
this
side
light
he
turned
on
a
light
on
the
wall
on
the
other
side
of
merriam
s
bed
switched
off
the
ceiling
lights
and
surveyed
the
effect
that
s
good
he
said
if
we
have
to
bring
any
one
in
you
can
lie
looking
this
way
and
still
your
face
will
be
in
shadow
lie
well
down
in
with
the
covers
up
to
your
chin
now
i
ll
bring
you
some
breakfast
merriam
left
alone
for
a
minute
wished
he
had
been
permitted
to
finish
his
breakfast
in
the
sitting
room
before
being
sent
to
bed
he
had
counted
on
that
breakfast
and
the
first
course
had
been
fully
as
delightful
as
he
had
pictured
it
rockwell
soon
returned
carrying
a
tray
on
which
was
a
plate
of
really
fine
ham
with
rolls
and
butter
and
a
cup
of
coffee
i
guess
i
m
not
too
sick
to
sit
up
to
eat
so
long
as
only
you
re
here
said
merriam
suiting
his
posture
to
the
word
and
falling
to
with
appetite
rockwell
drew
up
a
chair
and
for
several
minutes
sat
smoking
in
silence
then
he
said
did
you
catch
thompson
s
parting
shot
about
yes
merriam
replied
without
interrupting
operations
what
did
he
mean
rockwell
drew
a
clipping
from
his
pocket
listen
he
said
and
read
the
following
senator
s
night
there
was
a
dance
last
night
at
reiberg
s
place
on
the
west
side
most
of
our
readers
do
not
know
reiberg
s
it
comprises
a
dancing
floor
over
a
saloon
with
a
bar
attached
for
the
convenience
of
patrons
who
may
not
be
willing
or
as
the
evening
advances
able
to
go
downstairs
to
the
saloon
also
certain
small
rooms
where
one
may
drink
or
otherwise
enjoy
oneself
quite
privately
its
patrons
male
and
female
are
chiefly
employees
in
the
neighbouring
factories
but
last
night
reiberg
s
was
honoured
we
are
credibly
informed
by
a
guest
from
quite
a
different
sphere
no
less
than
a
senator
of
the
united
states
we
are
not
able
at
present
to
give
his
name
with
certainty
and
of
course
we
are
not
willing
to
give
names
in
such
a
case
until
we
have
verified
our
information
with
scrupulous
care
but
he
certainly
announced
himself
as
senator
and
he
looked
the
part
and
distributed
money
presumably
from
the
salary
paid
to
him
out
of
public
funds
with
lavish
abandon
having
tried
to
kiss
one
of
the
prettier
girls
and
been
knocked
down
by
her
escort
who
evidently
knew
naught
of
senatorial
courtesies
he
emphasised
the
sincerity
of
his
tipsy
apologies
by
handing
the
lucky
insulted
one
a
bill
later
it
is
said
he
attached
himself
to
another
young
woman
unaccompanied
it
would
seem
by
any
pugnacious
swain
with
whom
he
spent
several
hours
partly
on
the
dancing
floor
and
partly
elsewhere
finally
with
we
fear
little
of
his
money
left
about
him
he
was
charitably
carried
off
by
the
chauffeur
of
his
waiting
taxi
well
well
after
the
arduous
strain
of
legislative
labours
one
doubtless
feels
the
need
of
a
little
relaxation
we
hope
the
senator
enjoyed
himself
rockwell
folded
up
his
clipping
a
tolerably
close
paraphrase
of
simpson
s
story
he
remarked
they
have
the
facts
pretty
straight
what
is
this
asked
merriam
sitting
on
his
pillow
with
the
tray
in
his
lap
he
had
stopped
eating
oh
a
dirty
little
sheet
of
scandal
twice
a
week
but
it
s
pretty
widely
read
and
they
know
his
name
of
course
in
fact
any
one
can
guess
it
because
senator
norman
is
known
to
be
in
the
city
and
there
is
no
other
united
states
senator
stopping
here
now
so
far
as
any
one
knows
it
will
be
a
bit
nasty
if
they
push
this
sort
of
thing
they
ll
put
it
in
the
regular
newspapers
next
a
straight
news
item
with
his
name
in
it
that
article
doesn
t
say
where
he
went
afterwards
said
merriam
but
thompson
knew
they
re
keeping
that
in
reserve
listen
male
voices
were
audible
from
the
sitting
room
the
reporters
exclaimed
rockwell
i
ll
take
that
tray
lie
down
and
cover
up
i
must
go
and
help
aunt
mary
hold
the
fort
merriam
finished
his
coffee
in
a
gulp
and
rockwell
set
the
tray
on
the
seat
of
a
chair
and
hastily
entered
the
sitting
room
there
followed
a
long
period
more
than
an
hour
in
fact
during
which
merriam
lay
in
bed
and
listened
to
varied
voices
from
the
other
room
and
speculated
as
to
what
was
going
on
and
wondered
what
he
should
do
if
the
door
should
open
and
some
irresistibly
aggressive
reporter
or
irresistibly
important
political
friend
of
norman
s
be
ushered
in
but
rockwell
and
aunt
mary
with
the
occasional
support
of
hobart
successfully
withstood
the
army
of
reporters
and
a
few
minor
politicians
who
called
and
at
length
the
loud
masculine
voices
from
the
other
room
ceased
and
merriam
lay
still
somewhat
fatigued
by
his
prolonged
strain
of
apprehension
and
waited
presently
the
door
opened
and
aunt
mary
and
rockwell
entered
merriam
had
closed
his
eyes
but
rockwell
speedily
opened
them
oh
you
can
wake
up
he
said
it
s
all
right
the
coast
is
clear
merriam
rolled
over
so
as
to
lie
on
his
back
well
what
next
he
said
aunt
mary
and
rockwell
looked
at
each
other
rockwell
spoke
miss
norman
and
i
are
going
out
we
shall
drop
in
at
the
mayor
s
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
go
on
to
a
reform
league
luncheon
at
the
urban
club
i
am
due
to
act
as
toastmaster
or
chairman
for
the
speeches
afterwards
and
it
will
be
just
as
well
to
have
miss
norman
present
she
will
symbolise
the
prospective
new
alliance
we
are
going
to
leave
you
under
the
care
of
alicia
and
norman
no
one
else
is
likely
to
come
for
several
hours
now
we
shall
be
back
at
about
half
past
two
or
three
meanwhile
luncheon
you
didn
t
get
a
very
big
breakfast
after
all
simpson
shall
serve
it
here
by
your
bed
and
alicia
and
mollie
june
can
eat
with
you
this
disposition
suited
merriam
excellently
well
but
he
made
no
comment
he
tried
to
decide
whether
aunt
mary
was
really
eyeing
him
sharply
or
whether
he
only
imagined
it
in
any
case
she
almost
immediately
added
a
rather
formal
good
morning
and
returned
to
the
sitting
room
rockwell
lingered
a
moment
we
re
going
to
try
to
bring
norman
back
here
this
evening
you
know
if
it
s
at
all
possible
if
it
shouldn
t
be
if
he
s
too
sick
or
something
i
suppose
you
could
stay
over
another
day
still
merriam
thought
with
a
panic
of
his
school
not
unless
it
s
absolutely
necessary
he
replied
with
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
it
probably
won
t
be
said
rockwell
reassuringly
we
re
quite
as
anxious
to
get
rid
of
you
you
know
he
added
smiling
as
you
can
be
to
get
away
from
us
a
double
s
a
horribly
dangerous
thing
to
have
around
well
so
long
in
less
than
five
minutes
after
rockwell
s
departure
there
came
a
knock
at
that
door
upon
which
merriam
s
attention
was
concentrated
a
distinctly
feminine
knock
merriam
disposed
himself
as
discreetly
as
possible
under
the
bedclothes
and
answered
it
alicia
opened
the
door
and
peeped
may
i
come
in
she
opened
it
wider
and
came
through
i
m
the
chaperon
you
know
are
you
asked
merriam
smiling
alicia
was
pleased
by
his
smile
and
said
so
i
always
like
it
when
people
laugh
at
the
idea
of
my
being
a
chaperon
why
said
merriam
oh
so
long
as
it
seems
funny
for
a
woman
to
be
a
chaperon
she
s
young
it
seems
funny
for
you
said
merriam
that
s
very
nicely
said
returned
alicia
come
in
mollie
june
as
mollie
june
did
not
appear
alicia
looked
into
the
sitting
room
why
she
said
she
must
have
gone
into
her
bedroom
i
do
believe
she
s
doing
her
hair
over
and
alicia
raised
her
eyebrows
in
spite
of
hope
deferred
merriam
was
made
happy
he
recalled
the
supreme
necessity
of
shaving
earlier
that
morning
alicia
dropped
into
the
chair
by
the
bed
in
which
rockwell
had
sat
and
pretended
to
scan
the
invalid
s
face
solicitously
i
should
say
senator
she
remarked
that
you
do
not
like
a
very
sick
man
your
condition
must
be
improving
we
can
hope
you
will
be
able
to
take
a
little
nourishment
you
can
hope
that
all
right
grinned
the
invalid
i
ve
ordered
alicia
making
talk
plunged
into
the
details
of
a
quite
elaborate
refection
by
the
time
she
had
finished
and
had
replied
to
one
or
two
humorous
comments
from
merriam
whose
spirits
were
certainly
rising
simpson
presented
himself
with
the
substantial
fulfillment
of
her
prospectus
and
not
until
then
did
mollie
june
join
them
her
coiffure
though
simple
was
certainly
faultless
and
so
far
as
a
masculine
eye
could
judge
newly
arranged
alicia
caught
merriam
s
glance
and
read
his
thoughts
and
smiled
what
is
it
asked
mollie
june
suspiciously
what
is
what
said
merriam
lamely
the
senator
has
been
very
humorous
over
the
meal
i
have
ordered
explained
alicia
more
deftly
don
t
call
him
the
senator
cried
mollie
june
his
name
is
her
eyes
met
merriam
s
for
an
instant
mr
john
i
see
said
alicia
in
the
dim
light
merriam
was
not
sure
whether
she
raised
her
eyebrows
again
or
not
but
he
was
afraid
she
did
simpson
intent
only
on
the
proper
illumination
of
his
carefully
laid
cloth
but
unwittingly
conspiring
with
the
elder
gods
fate
and
destiny
and
the
like
had
turned
on
the
night
lamp
and
set
it
on
the
corner
of
the
table
next
to
mollie
june
and
its
radiance
fell
full
on
her
slender
erect
figure
now
arrayed
in
merriam
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
kind
of
fabric
it
was
but
it
was
creamy
white
and
at
her
waist
was
one
of
the
red
roses
he
had
helped
to
freshen
the
circle
of
bright
light
extended
up
to
her
white
throat
occasionally
when
she
leaned
forward
her
face
dipped
into
it
but
for
the
most
part
showed
only
dimly
in
the
fainter
glow
that
came
through
the
shade
of
the
lamp
he
could
see
her
eyes
however
and
not
infrequently
they
rested
on
him
his
it
is
to
be
feared
were
on
her
most
of
the
time
when
at
length
the
luncheon
was
finished
and
merriam
had
expressed
himself
as
disinclined
for
cigarettes
and
simpson
had
removed
his
dishes
and
his
table
and
finally
himself
alicia
who
was
really
a
most
person
a
pearl
among
chaperons
yawned
and
announced
that
she
had
a
novel
which
she
desired
to
finish
and
that
if
they
didn
t
mind
she
proposed
to
retire
to
the
sitting
room
to
prosecute
that
literary
occupation
you
can
amuse
him
for
a
while
norman
she
said
with
a
humorous
smile
merriam
did
not
venture
to
question
what
more
subtle
thoughts
that
smile
might
veil
he
s
your
guest
more
than
mine
seeing
it
s
your
husband
he
s
impersonating
if
he
gets
too
boring
you
can
come
for
me
and
i
ll
spell
you
neither
mollie
june
nor
merriam
replied
but
alicia
still
with
that
amused
smile
rose
and
calmly
departed
she
left
the
door
open
of
course
between
the
two
rooms
upon
the
two
young
people
thus
abruptly
left
alone
together
there
descended
an
embarrassed
silence
for
a
minute
or
so
they
heard
alicia
moving
about
in
the
sitting
room
and
then
the
small
sounds
which
one
makes
in
adjusting
one
s
self
comfortably
in
an
armchair
with
a
footstool
and
a
book
ending
in
a
pleasurable
sigh
merriam
was
overwhelmed
by
the
necessity
of
finding
talk
he
could
not
lie
there
in
bed
and
stare
at
mollie
june
however
beatitudinous
it
might
have
been
to
do
so
several
seconds
of
prodigious
intellectual
labour
brought
forth
this
polite
question
do
you
hear
often
from
the
girls
in
riceville
not
very
often
said
mollie
june
we
can
hardly
describe
this
reply
as
helpful
again
he
struggled
mightily
with
the
banal
kind
of
result
that
usually
follows
such
paroxysms
conversational
you
must
find
your
life
here
and
in
washington
wonderful
it
seemed
so
at
first
said
mollie
june
but
it
didn
t
last
merriam
was
conscious
of
danger
on
this
tack
but
he
must
have
a
moment
s
rest
before
he
could
wrestle
with
the
void
again
no
said
mollie
june
merriam
waited
not
shirking
his
responsibilities
but
conscious
that
she
meant
to
continue
she
was
always
deliberate
of
speech
a
fact
which
gave
a
piquant
significance
to
her
simplest
words
you
see
she
said
i
didn
t
really
care
very
much
for
george
i
thought
i
did
at
first
but
i
didn
t
papa
really
made
me
marry
him
and
you
know
he
is
untrue
to
me
merriam
could
have
gasped
he
felt
himself
falling
through
the
thin
ice
of
mere
conversation
on
which
he
had
tried
so
hard
to
skate
into
the
depths
of
real
talk
but
it
was
good
to
be
in
the
depths
and
after
his
first
breathlessness
he
was
filled
with
love
and
pity
how
much
the
brief
girlish
sentences
portrayed
of
disillusionment
and
tragedy
you
know
about
that
then
he
asked
gently
of
course
said
mollie
june
almost
scornfully
before
company
aunt
mary
and
alicia
and
rockwell
keep
up
the
pretence
that
i
can
know
nothing
about
such
things
i
keep
it
up
too
but
aunt
mary
knows
all
about
them
george
never
can
conceal
anything
from
her
and
i
make
her
tell
me
everything
everything
merriam
i
suspect
hardly
sensed
the
amount
of
intellect
and
character
which
mollie
june
s
last
statement
betrayed
i
use
the
word
advisedly
for
of
course
intellect
and
character
detract
from
a
young
girl
s
charm
and
if
she
desires
to
be
pretty
and
alluring
she
should
and
usually
does
carefully
conceal
whatever
of
such
attributes
she
may
be
handicapped
with
but
to
make
aunt
mary
disclose
things
she
wished
not
to
disclose
was
no
small
achievement
you
know
about
this
jennie
higgins
merriam
asked
yes
i
ve
seen
her
and
talked
with
her
how
was
merriam
s
startled
question
she
s
a
manicurist
you
know
she
s
employed
at
mollie
june
mentioned
a
establishment
on
michigan
avenue
the
name
of
which
for
obvious
reasons
i
suppress
when
i
found
that
out
i
went
there
to
have
my
nails
done
i
just
asked
for
madame
couteau
and
waited
till
she
was
free
she
didn
t
know
me
of
course
she
s
pretty
said
mollie
june
with
judicial
coldness
after
a
moment
she
added
and
sweet
and
warm
but
how
any
man
can
leave
you
cried
merriam
treading
recklessly
on
several
kinds
of
dynamite
you
haven
t
seen
her
said
mollie
june
merriam
was
silenced
it
was
true
he
had
not
seen
her
and
he
remembered
with
confusion
that
he
had
talked
with
her
over
a
wire
and
as
rockwell
put
it
had
not
needed
much
prompting
he
stole
a
glance
at
mollie
june
the
purity
of
her
figure
its
brave
erectness
and
the
impassive
sadness
so
out
of
place
on
her
young
face
caught
at
his
heart
how
can
you
stand
it
he
cried
and
would
have
put
out
his
hand
to
her
had
he
not
remembered
that
he
was
in
bed
and
that
his
arm
was
clad
only
in
the
sleeve
of
a
suit
of
pajamas
mollie
june
looked
at
him
i
don
t
know
she
said
what
else
can
i
do
merriam
lay
still
now
openly
staring
at
her
of
all
intolerable
things
of
which
he
had
ever
heard
it
seemed
to
him
the
worst
that
mollie
june
the
prettiest
girl
with
all
her
loveliness
and
sweetness
and
courage
and
youthful
joy
in
life
should
be
so
slighted
and
wronged
and
saddened
and
degraded
it
was
like
seeing
a
rose
trampled
under
foot
merriam
s
mental
simile
was
not
very
original
perhaps
but
to
him
it
was
intensely
poignant
for
a
moment
she
met
his
gaze
then
looked
away
in
the
subdued
light
merriam
could
not
be
sure
but
he
thought
there
was
a
new
brightness
of
tears
in
her
eyes
released
perhaps
by
his
very
apparent
though
inexpressive
sympathy
presently
the
thought
which
had
inevitably
come
to
him
forced
itself
almost
against
his
will
to
expression
you
could
divorce
him
i
ve
thought
of
that
somehow
this
shocked
merriam
but
it
would
be
too
horrible
have
you
read
the
divorce
trials
in
the
papers
with
a
senator
they
would
make
the
most
of
it
and
aunt
mary
won
t
let
me
do
that
it
would
ruin
him
politically
she
says
well
what
if
it
did
how
about
you
oh
she
loves
him
you
know
she
thinks
he
can
be
brought
to
change
his
ways
she
believes
in
him
still
do
you
no
said
mollie
june
with
the
cruel
simplicity
of
youth
he
may
die
was
the
thought
in
merriam
s
mind
but
this
could
not
be
said
full
of
pity
he
gazed
at
her
again
and
something
in
the
profile
of
her
averted
face
overcame
him
he
started
up
on
his
elbow
all
this
time
he
had
lain
with
his
head
on
his
arm
on
the
pillow
mollie
june
he
cried
his
voice
softly
raised
she
did
not
look
at
him
dear
mollie
june
you
must
know
i
love
you
i
loved
you
three
years
ago
in
riceville
there
s
nothing
wrong
about
that
when
you
re
in
such
trouble
i
must
tell
you
it
can
t
do
you
any
good
there
s
nothing
we
can
do
but
i
do
love
you
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
that
in
riceville
oh
he
cried
mollie
june
rose
and
came
to
the
bedside
i
know
she
said
with
womanly
gentleness
you
couldn
t
of
course
because
you
were
so
poor
i
ought
to
have
waited
john
for
a
moment
her
hand
hovered
above
his
head
as
if
she
would
have
stroked
his
ruffled
hair
but
it
descended
to
her
side
again
we
mustn
t
talk
like
this
i
must
go
i
ll
tell
alicia
we
are
bored
there
were
tears
not
only
in
her
eyes
but
on
her
cheeks
now
undisguisedly
she
wiped
them
away
and
carefully
dried
her
eyes
with
a
small
handkerchief
i
shall
see
you
at
dinner
she
said
with
a
brave
smile
and
turning
walked
quickly
out
of
the
room
of
it
was
some
time
before
alicia
with
something
more
if
possible
than
her
usual
aplomb
covering
let
us
hope
a
guilty
conscience
entered
the
bedroom
presumably
to
spell
mollie
june
in
amusing
the
supposed
invalid
alicia
made
some
remark
which
hardly
penetrated
the
invalid
s
consciousness
but
scarcely
had
she
sat
down
in
mollie
june
s
chair
before
a
quick
knock
sounded
at
the
hall
door
of
the
sitting
room
almost
immediately
followed
by
the
sound
of
the
opening
of
that
door
and
alicia
sprang
up
again
and
hurried
away
to
be
before
mollie
june
in
receiving
the
newcomers
it
began
to
irritate
merriam
to
perceive
how
they
all
treated
her
as
a
little
girl
when
as
he
now
thrillingly
realised
she
was
very
much
a
woman
in
spite
of
the
youthfulness
of
her
face
and
figure
the
arrivals
in
the
other
room
proved
to
be
rockwell
and
aunt
mary
returned
recognising
their
voices
merriam
glanced
at
his
watch
under
his
pillow
and
was
amazed
to
find
that
it
was
nearly
four
o
clock
rockwell
appeared
in
the
doorway
come
into
this
other
room
he
said
we
must
hold
a
council
of
war
shall
i
dress
asked
merriam
gladly
getting
out
of
bed
no
no
said
rockwell
impatiently
just
put
on
your
bath
robe
and
slippers
having
followed
this
instruction
merriam
stepped
to
the
glass
and
with
a
few
quick
strokes
of
the
brush
smoothed
his
hair
rockwell
watching
him
without
comment
then
they
went
into
the
sitting
room
merriam
blankly
perceived
that
the
sitting
room
was
empty
of
mollie
june
she
has
a
slight
headache
said
alicia
kindly
suffering
still
we
may
hope
from
pangs
of
conscience
aunt
mary
was
sitting
in
the
senatorial
armchair
which
had
been
turned
about
to
face
the
rest
of
the
room
she
looked
long
and
hard
at
merriam
an
intensification
of
that
close
scrutiny
with
which
it
seemed
to
him
she
had
always
distinguished
him
merriam
in
his
bath
robe
sustained
it
awkwardly
but
manfully
alicia
and
rockwell
were
standing
the
silence
was
rather
portentous
sit
down
all
of
you
said
aunt
mary
suddenly
the
three
younger
persons
present
even
rockwell
seemed
youthful
beside
aunt
mary
in
her
dominant
mood
rather
hurriedly
found
seats
is
the
door
locked
philip
rockwell
rose
went
to
the
hall
door
turned
the
key
and
returned
to
his
chair
tell
him
said
aunt
mary
rockwell
s
budget
of
news
was
certainly
considerable
and
important
in
the
first
place
george
norman
was
better
rockwell
and
aunt
mary
had
gone
to
see
him
at
jennie
s
after
the
reform
league
luncheon
that
was
why
they
were
so
late
he
undoubtedly
had
a
touch
of
bronchitis
with
some
fever
and
a
cough
but
seemed
to
be
improving
he
could
be
brought
back
to
the
hotel
that
evening
aunt
mary
had
sat
down
by
his
bed
and
told
him
briefly
but
plainly
of
the
happenings
at
the
hotel
the
previous
evening
and
had
extorted
a
feeble
amazed
acquiescence
in
the
astonishing
turn
which
had
been
given
to
his
career
an
acquiescence
which
she
had
immediately
communicated
by
telephone
from
jennie
s
to
mayor
black
in
the
second
place
the
story
of
norman
s
evening
at
reiberg
s
was
all
over
the
city
not
among
the
populace
of
course
but
among
the
politicians
and
business
men
and
clubmen
the
men
who
know
things
not
only
the
story
in
which
everybody
seemed
to
have
read
and
to
have
assigned
unhesitatingly
to
norman
but
the
further
fact
that
from
reiberg
s
he
had
gone
in
the
taxi
to
a
certain
little
flat
that
seemed
to
be
the
approved
phrase
and
had
spent
the
night
there
and
was
still
there
the
simple
truth
in
short
was
known
rockwell
had
taken
his
cue
perforce
from
merriam
s
impulsive
denial
to
thompson
and
had
flatly
contradicted
the
whole
story
senator
norman
had
spent
the
evening
after
his
interviews
with
crockett
and
with
mayor
black
at
the
hotel
with
his
wife
and
was
there
now
slightly
indisposed
with
a
severe
cold
which
had
threatened
to
turn
into
bronchitis
his
downright
assertions
had
rockwell
believed
shaken
the
confident
rumours
and
would
probably
delay
any
further
publication
of
them
for
at
least
a
day
but
it
was
necessary
to
produce
evidence
we
shall
have
to
use
you
again
he
said
to
merriam
i
have
invited
the
mayor
and
wayward
to
dine
with
you
here
at
the
hotel
downstairs
in
the
peacock
cabaret
shall
i
have
to
play
the
senator
there
gasped
merriam
in
public
said
rockwell
i
have
reserved
a
table
in
an
alcove
we
shall
put
you
in
the
corner
all
the
rest
of
us
will
be
between
you
and
the
general
gaze
oh
we
shall
get
away
with
it
it
s
much
less
dangerous
than
trying
to
impose
at
close
range
in
a
private
interview
on
some
one
who
really
knows
the
senator
as
you
did
on
thompson
this
morning
does
wayward
know
asked
merriam
of
the
impersonation
not
yet
but
alicia
shall
prepare
him
in
advance
alicia
nodded
that
s
all
right
she
said
daddy
will
enjoy
it
he
ll
think
it
s
a
huge
joke
moreover
continued
rockwell
with
rather
apprehensive
eyes
on
merriam
i
have
accepted
an
invitation
for
senator
gorman
to
speak
at
the
reform
league
luncheon
do
they
have
luncheons
and
speeches
every
day
asked
merriam
sparring
for
time
for
of
course
he
saw
what
was
coming
not
usually
but
they
ve
been
having
a
series
is
the
last
one
it
s
the
perfect
opportunity
for
norman
to
come
out
openly
for
the
league
when
the
invitation
came
i
simply
had
to
accept
it
but
if
george
norman
isn
t
able
to
speak
queried
alicia
fearlessly
coming
to
the
point
then
you
ll
have
to
make
the
speech
said
rockwell
bluntly
to
merriam
but
how
can
i
you
were
a
debater
in
college
yes
but
the
speech
itself
oh
aunt
mary
will
fix
you
up
with
a
speech
merriam
turned
to
that
silent
mistress
of
the
situation
sitting
calmly
in
the
senatorial
armchair
george
is
so
very
busy
that
i
often
write
his
speeches
for
him
she
said
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
arrangement
in
the
world
i
have
several
sketched
out
now
we
can
make
a
choice
among
them
i
will
write
it
out
in
full
and
you
can
learn
it
or
i
will
turn
over
the
outline
to
you
and
you
can
work
it
up
in
your
own
words
if
you
have
to
make
it
you
probably
won
t
rockwell
hastened
to
say
norman
is
really
much
better
after
a
comfortable
night
here
at
the
hotel
he
will
be
all
right
if
he
s
a
little
hoarse
we
can
t
help
it
but
you
must
stay
over
you
see
he
added
determinedly
to
make
sure
that
speech
must
be
made
but
my
school
cried
merriam
you
ll
have
to
send
another
telegram
said
aunt
mary
what
s
a
day
or
two
of
school
asked
rockwell
impatiently
with
a
layman
s
insensibility
to
the
pedagogical
dogmas
of
absolute
regularity
and
punctuality
besides
if
you
really
were
sick
he
added
more
tactfully
they
would
have
to
get
along
without
you
wouldn
t
they
so
much
is
at
stake
said
aunt
mary
george
s
future
and
all
that
that
may
mean
to
the
state
and
nation
if
we
can
bring
him
to
throw
the
weight
of
his
popularity
and
leadership
on
the
right
side
you
can
t
desert
us
now
merriam
cried
alicia
when
it
means
so
much
to
aunt
mary
and
philip
and
mollie
june
crafty
alicia
her
guile
was
of
course
clearly
apparent
to
merriam
but
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
perceive
that
an
influence
is
being
deliberately
brought
to
bear
on
one
without
being
able
to
resist
that
influence
very
well
i
ll
telegraph
again
he
said
better
do
it
now
said
rockwell
promptly
clinching
this
decision
he
rose
went
to
the
writing
table
got
out
a
telegraph
form
and
sat
down
what
shall
i
write
merriam
collected
himself
as
best
he
could
under
alicia
s
admiring
expectant
eyes
and
aunt
mary
s
steady
regard
better
he
dictated
but
doctor
won
t
let
me
leave
expect
to
be
down
night
that
s
good
said
aunt
mary
in
a
tone
of
quiet
approval
which
gratified
merriam
more
probably
than
he
realised
rockwell
finished
writing
and
turned
in
his
chair
i
ll
be
going
down
in
a
few
minutes
i
ll
send
it
then
now
you
ll
need
to
dress
for
dinner
senator
pack
up
your
things
too
after
dinner
you
and
i
will
leave
the
hotel
together
in
a
taxi
we
shall
drive
over
to
the
university
club
there
we
shall
simply
go
up
to
the
library
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
come
down
again
walk
up
michigan
avenue
for
a
block
or
two
and
catch
another
taxi
and
drive
to
the
nestor
house
there
you
can
register
under
your
own
name
simpson
will
send
your
things
over
i
shall
go
on
and
get
norman
and
bring
him
back
here
you
see
senator
norman
leaves
the
hotel
about
nine
o
clock
with
his
new
manager
me
within
an
hour
or
so
he
returns
still
in
my
company
and
goes
to
his
room
if
he
s
all
right
you
can
go
down
to
riceville
on
the
morning
train
if
you
like
i
ll
come
to
see
you
before
you
go
we
ll
go
over
to
see
you
said
alicia
with
an
unmistakable
emphasis
on
the
all
we
shall
have
so
much
to
thank
you
for
merriam
did
not
reply
to
this
cordial
remark
why
do
we
go
to
the
university
club
he
asked
and
not
directly
to
the
other
hotel
said
rockwell
well
i
m
afraid
we
may
be
rather
closely
watched
to
tell
the
truth
i
suspect
that
the
driver
of
the
taxi
we
take
here
may
be
questioned
afterwards
as
to
where
he
set
us
down
the
university
club
will
tell
them
nothing
to
merriam
s
excited
mood
this
explanation
with
its
hint
of
powerful
hidden
enemies
intently
watching
every
move
which
he
and
his
friends
could
make
added
a
touch
of
piquancy
to
the
situation
that
was
nothing
short
of
delightful
he
could
not
well
express
this
however
and
rockwell
who
was
all
business
with
no
such
romantic
nonsense
in
his
head
immediately
sent
them
about
their
several
parts
he
himself
was
first
to
take
alicia
to
her
waiting
limousine
when
alicia
and
rockwell
had
departed
merriam
sought
to
return
to
his
the
senator
s
bedroom
but
aunt
mary
detained
him
sit
down
merriam
she
said
kindly
enough
but
in
a
manner
that
demanded
unquestioning
obedience
then
she
rose
and
entered
mollie
june
s
bedroom
but
immediately
returned
mollie
june
is
dressing
for
dinner
she
said
an
instant
s
pause
then
looking
hard
at
merriam
she
s
a
lovely
child
both
the
look
and
the
final
word
provoked
merriam
to
a
sort
of
resentment
i
don
t
believe
she
s
as
much
of
a
child
as
you
think
he
said
boldly
it
depends
on
the
point
of
view
no
doubt
said
aunt
mary
drily
then
she
began
to
ask
him
about
himself
his
family
his
own
life
on
the
farm
of
his
boyhood
at
college
and
at
riceville
all
those
facts
which
alicia
had
so
much
more
tactfully
elicited
in
the
private
dining
room
off
the
peacock
cabaret
the
night
before
and
some
others
in
which
alicia
had
not
been
interested
merriam
had
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
spoke
up
promptly
and
manfully
in
his
replies
wondering
in
the
back
of
his
mind
the
while
what
inscrutable
thought
or
purpose
prompted
aunt
mary
in
her
catechising
he
little
dreamt
that
the
whole
course
and
happiness
of
his
life
turned
on
the
showing
he
was
able
to
make
in
this
odd
examination
there
is
no
doubt
that
aunt
mary
whatever
her
idea
may
have
been
was
satisfied
when
at
length
she
had
no
more
questions
to
ask
the
expression
of
her
eyes
though
they
still
rested
on
him
was
almost
one
of
absence
she
drew
a
deeper
breath
than
was
her
wont
suggestive
at
least
of
a
sigh
you
give
a
good
account
of
yourself
she
said
you
are
worthy
of
the
norman
blood
greater
praise
than
that
no
man
could
have
from
aunt
mary
as
merriam
dimly
realised
i
wish
george
were
more
like
you
immediately
she
added
with
a
conscious
return
to
dominating
briskness
you
must
dress
so
must
i
and
she
rose
and
without
looking
again
at
merriam
went
into
mollie
june
s
bedroom
senatorial
at
last
at
minutes
after
six
merriam
sank
exhausted
but
immaculate
into
an
easy
chair
and
lit
a
cigarette
in
an
effort
to
compose
his
nerves
and
regain
the
he
needed
for
his
imminent
rôle
of
a
particularly
debonair
senator
of
the
united
states
acting
as
host
to
a
brilliant
dinner
party
at
half
past
six
precisely
aunt
mary
knocked
on
his
door
and
he
opened
that
door
and
announced
himself
ready
aunt
mary
wore
another
black
evening
gown
very
similar
in
masculine
eyes
to
the
one
in
which
she
had
appeared
the
night
before
except
that
it
was
less
conspicuously
burdened
with
jet
tall
and
erect
with
her
gray
hair
plainly
but
carefully
dressed
she
looked
every
inch
a
senator
s
sister
and
this
would
have
pleased
her
a
norman
advancing
into
the
sitting
room
merriam
encountered
mollie
june
standing
again
beside
the
bowl
of
roses
she
was
in
pink
tulle
over
satin
though
merriam
could
not
have
described
it
so
but
the
vivid
colour
and
the
dainty
softness
of
the
fabric
he
could
appreciate
quite
well
enough
at
least
in
their
contiguity
to
the
slender
figure
white
throat
and
shoulders
and
charming
complexion
of
mollie
june
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
looked
a
moment
longer
than
he
should
the
debonair
senatorial
outside
of
him
was
moved
to
say
how
lovely
you
are
but
the
ricevillian
pedagogue
underneath
blocked
the
utterance
perhaps
his
eyes
said
it
plainly
enough
to
satisfy
mollie
june
for
she
evinced
no
disappointment
we
must
go
right
down
mustn
t
we
she
said
raising
her
eyes
from
the
roses
yes
said
aunt
mary
in
a
tone
of
jarring
briskness
a
male
figure
which
merriam
had
not
perceived
stepped
out
of
the
background
moved
to
the
hall
door
and
opened
it
merriam
saw
that
it
was
hobart
quite
as
as
himself
and
rather
more
at
ease
but
not
nearly
so
handsome
though
of
this
i
assure
you
merriam
never
thought
at
all
aunt
mary
and
mollie
june
passed
through
the
door
come
along
senator
said
hobart
in
excellent
spirits
and
merriam
mechanically
followed
and
mechanically
paused
and
waited
while
the
physician
closed
and
locked
the
door
this
must
be
great
fun
for
you
said
hobart
as
they
went
down
the
hall
towards
the
elevators
yes
returned
merriam
without
conviction
his
eyes
on
a
girlish
figure
in
pink
that
moved
ahead
of
him
fun
did
not
strike
him
as
exactly
the
word
fortunately
at
this
point
a
small
incident
occurred
which
served
to
bring
merriam
out
of
the
brown
study
or
perhaps
we
may
say
the
roseate
study
into
which
he
had
fallen
as
they
approached
the
elevator
lobby
he
became
aware
of
the
pretty
floor
clerk
who
on
the
previous
evening
had
been
wearing
senator
norman
s
violets
he
was
of
course
entirely
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
on
his
way
to
norman
s
rooms
that
morning
he
had
passed
her
rudely
by
without
a
glance
but
he
did
notice
that
this
evening
she
wore
no
flowers
and
that
she
studiously
avoided
seeing
him
and
smiled
her
best
smile
upon
hobart
instead
that
gentleman
with
a
shade
too
much
alacrity
stepped
aside
so
as
to
pass
close
to
her
desk
and
leaning
down
spoke
to
her
the
pretty
floor
clerk
from
the
toss
of
her
head
and
the
pleased
smile
on
hobart
s
face
had
said
something
saucy
in
reply
good
enough
thought
merriam
as
they
all
stepped
into
the
elevator
i
m
glad
she
has
more
interests
than
one
and
thought
no
more
of
the
incident
at
the
time
in
a
moment
or
two
more
they
had
reached
the
basement
floor
which
was
their
destination
opposite
the
elevators
on
this
floor
was
a
small
reception
room
or
parlour
and
here
senator
norman
s
other
guests
were
awaiting
him
rockwell
murray
mayor
black
alicia
and
alicia
s
father
to
the
gentleman
merriam
was
immediately
presented
he
was
a
stoutish
jovial
man
of
fifty
or
so
bald
of
pate
and
humorous
of
eye
and
the
amused
particularity
with
which
he
surveyed
merriam
and
the
gusto
with
which
he
addressed
him
as
senator
showed
both
that
alicia
had
performed
her
task
of
enlightening
him
and
that
she
had
been
right
as
to
the
attitude
he
would
take
splendid
he
whispered
to
merriam
you
would
have
fooled
me
all
right
and
he
beamed
delightedly
alicia
gave
him
only
a
minute
they
are
ready
she
said
we
are
to
go
right
in
you
are
to
walk
with
me
this
last
to
merriam
in
a
moment
therefore
merriam
found
himself
escorting
alicia
down
a
sort
of
central
aisle
among
the
tables
of
the
peacock
cabaret
behind
an
excessively
urbane
head
waiter
conscious
that
the
rest
of
his
guests
were
making
a
more
or
less
imposing
procession
after
them
and
intensely
conscious
of
suspended
conversation
throughout
the
great
restaurant
and
of
countless
curious
eyes
staring
across
rosebuds
and
water
bottles
at
himself
say
something
to
me
whispered
alicia
you
mustn
t
look
merriam
glanced
at
her
and
realised
for
the
first
time
that
evening
her
vivid
vigorous
beauty
what
can
i
say
he
asked
smiling
except
how
lovely
you
are
and
he
wondered
why
it
was
so
easy
to
say
this
to
alicia
when
he
had
been
unable
to
say
it
to
mollie
june
bravo
boy
senator
applauded
alicia
and
then
they
reached
the
haven
of
that
alcove
which
rockwell
had
promised
it
was
really
a
small
square
room
quite
separate
from
the
main
part
of
the
peacock
cabaret
except
that
there
was
no
wall
between
the
head
waiter
guided
merriam
to
the
seat
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
thus
when
he
sat
down
he
would
be
facing
the
main
dining
room
visible
to
all
its
occupants
yet
screened
from
them
by
the
table
and
his
own
guests
about
that
table
it
was
really
an
excellent
device
for
displaying
him
in
public
and
still
protecting
him
from
close
inspection
in
a
moment
the
whole
party
had
arrived
and
been
seated
a
canapé
was
being
served
and
alicia
at
his
end
of
the
table
and
her
father
at
the
other
end
were
starting
conversation
merriam
glanced
across
the
board
at
mollie
june
for
some
reason
a
charming
girl
never
looks
more
lovely
than
at
table
she
looked
up
and
caught
his
gaze
her
face
was
grave
he
thought
she
looked
wistful
for
a
moment
only
he
met
her
eyes
then
turned
to
reply
to
a
remark
of
alicia
s
somehow
his
spirits
soared
he
plunged
into
the
conversation
with
a
zest
which
he
had
hardly
known
since
his
fraternity
days
mollie
june
said
little
but
she
laughed
at
the
stories
and
seemed
to
become
excited
and
happy
she
was
content
perhaps
to
enact
the
rôle
of
the
gallery
to
which
merriam
was
playing
with
such
excellent
effect
as
for
rockwell
and
aunt
mary
they
sat
by
in
serene
content
the
affair
was
going
well
as
long
as
that
was
the
case
they
need
not
exert
themselves
the
mildly
uproarious
party
undoubtedly
attracted
the
desired
amount
of
attention
from
the
main
dining
room
eyes
were
turned
and
necks
craned
and
couples
and
groups
that
passed
the
alcove
almost
invariably
slowed
their
steps
to
stare
some
dozens
of
men
who
had
heard
the
stories
of
the
real
norman
s
whereabouts
were
convinced
that
these
were
false
at
least
in
part
by
the
witness
of
their
own
eyes
they
knew
that
the
senator
was
that
evening
at
any
rate
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
at
the
hotel
they
could
be
relied
upon
to
assert
as
much
in
all
parts
of
the
city
on
the
following
day
only
one
outsider
ventured
to
intrude
upon
the
party
and
submit
merriam
to
the
ordeal
of
closer
inspection
and
he
got
no
nearer
than
the
length
of
the
table
this
was
the
colonel
abbott
whom
merriam
had
so
perilously
encountered
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
the
night
before
merriam
remembered
him
vividly
called
him
by
name
and
replied
cordially
to
his
expressions
of
pleasure
at
finding
him
recovered
from
his
threatened
indisposition
so
that
danger
passed
and
the
table
after
a
brief
exchanging
of
relieved
glances
recovered
its
gayety
perhaps
with
some
accentuation
a
little
later
came
a
reporter
merriam
professed
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
asked
if
it
was
true
that
he
was
to
speak
at
the
reform
league
luncheon
on
the
morrow
he
replied
with
an
inner
quailing
but
with
outward
composure
that
he
was
the
reporter
turned
to
wayward
was
it
true
that
he
intended
to
make
a
contribution
to
the
campaign
fund
of
the
reform
league
wayward
s
joviality
suffered
an
eclipse
his
eyes
fell
but
on
raising
them
he
encountered
a
glance
from
his
daughter
that
can
only
be
described
as
stern
and
promptly
admitted
that
it
was
true
the
reporter
tried
rockwell
but
the
latter
shook
his
head
so
indomitably
that
the
interviewer
at
once
abandoned
him
and
passed
to
mayor
black
that
gentleman
promptly
and
as
it
were
automatically
gave
utterance
to
several
eloquent
phrases
too
meaningless
to
be
recorded
even
the
reporter
neglected
to
make
notes
of
them
and
looked
about
the
table
for
other
prey
finding
none
he
excused
himself
with
the
remark
i
am
making
note
of
the
names
of
course
and
disappeared
once
more
the
conspiratorial
table
drew
a
long
breath
and
endeavoured
to
recover
its
festive
mood
but
before
much
progress
had
been
made
in
that
direction
a
bell
boy
came
with
a
note
addressed
to
senator
norman
and
asking
that
he
and
rockwell
come
to
room
d
one
of
the
private
dining
rooms
merriam
passed
the
note
to
rockwell
and
then
to
aunt
mary
and
the
three
prime
conspirators
stared
at
one
another
none
of
them
knew
the
handwriting
which
was
poor
and
hurried
and
in
pencil
i
ll
go
said
rockwell
you
stay
here
the
rest
of
the
party
did
not
know
what
had
happened
but
in
their
situation
the
most
trivial
incident
was
of
course
sufficient
to
cause
uneasiness
the
conversation
during
rockwell
s
absence
was
forced
and
fragmentary
in
fact
it
was
almost
a
solo
performance
on
alicia
s
part
merriam
caught
mollie
june
s
eyes
upon
him
and
was
grateful
for
their
expression
of
solicitude
presently
the
boy
returned
again
with
the
same
note
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
scribbled
come
room
d
rockwell
merriam
showed
it
to
aunt
mary
is
that
his
handwriting
yes
it
is
then
i
suppose
i
must
go
he
rose
murmured
an
excuse
me
to
the
table
at
large
and
made
his
way
towards
the
open
end
of
the
alcove
as
he
did
so
he
glanced
at
mollie
june
alarm
stood
in
her
eyes
coming
opposite
her
chair
he
bent
down
and
said
gently
it
s
all
right
i
probably
shan
t
be
long
it
was
perhaps
a
little
too
much
in
the
tone
and
manner
that
mollie
june
s
real
husband
might
properly
have
used
mollie
june
herself
did
not
seem
to
notice
this
she
appeared
duly
comforted
but
wayward
at
her
left
undoubtedly
stared
after
merriam
with
an
odd
expression
in
his
genial
eyes
following
the
bell
boy
merriam
tried
hard
to
think
what
might
be
in
store
for
him
thompson
and
crockett
were
the
only
ideas
his
blank
mind
could
muster
had
they
discovered
the
trick
and
come
to
threaten
him
with
exposure
well
rockwell
would
be
present
he
leaned
heavily
on
rockwell
the
boy
stopped
before
a
curtained
door
this
is
it
sir
he
said
and
waited
expectantly
merriam
fumblingly
produced
a
dime
and
the
boy
departed
drawing
a
deep
breath
he
pushed
aside
the
curtain
and
entered
room
to
his
great
relief
the
only
persons
present
were
rockwell
and
simpson
they
were
both
standing
beside
a
bare
table
merriam
vaguely
remembered
that
simpson
had
not
appeared
in
connection
with
the
serving
of
the
last
two
or
three
courses
now
tell
it
again
said
rockwell
promptly
the
waiter
looked
steadily
at
merriam
it
s
this
way
sir
he
said
thompson
as
was
the
senator
s
manager
until
this
morning
has
found
out
where
the
senator
really
is
at
the
man
looked
away
jennie
s
he
finished
without
expression
in
his
tone
there
s
a
girl
she
lives
with
margery
milton
who
s
a
milliner
s
assistant
at
one
of
the
department
stores
he
got
it
from
her
straight
from
her
he
came
here
to
have
dinner
with
crockett
out
in
the
cabaret
when
i
saw
them
come
in
i
turned
your
party
over
to
another
man
and
served
them
myself
i
managed
to
hear
a
lot
of
what
they
said
crockett
had
learned
of
your
dinner
party
of
course
putting
that
together
with
what
thompson
had
got
from
margery
they
saw
the
game
crockett
would
hardly
believe
it
at
first
but
thompson
means
to
make
sure
he
s
going
to
jennie
s
himself
about
ten
o
clock
they
have
some
kind
of
a
committee
first
and
force
his
way
in
if
necessary
and
see
the
senator
himself
then
they
ll
have
proof
you
see
i
thought
i
d
better
let
you
and
rockwell
know
you
did
just
right
said
rockwell
warmly
and
we
ll
make
it
worth
your
while
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
younger
man
merriam
you
re
the
only
one
who
can
save
us
in
this
fix
how
said
merriam
to
whom
it
seemed
that
all
was
lost
listen
man
you
go
back
to
our
table
and
excuse
yourself
and
me
important
don
t
tell
them
anything
more
not
even
aunt
mary
we
haven
t
time
better
bring
murray
we
may
need
an
extra
man
and
we
can
trust
him
best
we
three
will
take
a
taxi
at
once
we
shall
have
to
circle
about
a
bit
to
throw
off
possible
trailers
but
in
less
than
an
hour
we
ll
be
at
jennie
s
you
shall
take
norman
s
place
there
and
we
ll
take
norman
and
bring
him
back
to
the
hotel
to
his
room
just
as
we
planned
only
a
bit
sooner
when
thompson
arrives
jennie
shall
let
him
in
he
ll
insist
on
seeing
you
let
him
you
re
not
senator
norman
tell
him
so
jennie
shall
tell
him
so
too
he
ll
see
it
himself
of
course
as
soon
as
he
looks
close
with
his
eyes
open
you
and
jennie
must
make
him
think
you
played
off
the
resemblance
on
this
margery
milton
for
a
joke
we
ll
fix
her
too
of
course
you
d
better
tell
him
your
real
name
so
he
can
look
you
up
if
he
wants
to
he
won
t
expose
you
in
riceville
he
ll
have
no
motive
to
and
he
won
t
think
anything
of
your
little
escapade
in
itself
you
came
to
chicago
on
school
business
went
out
to
see
the
sights
got
a
little
more
liquor
than
you
were
used
to
your
taxi
driver
took
you
to
some
dance
hall
he
ll
interpret
reiberg
you
stayed
there
a
while
don
t
know
what
you
did
met
jennie
there
and
she
brought
you
home
you
were
pretty
sick
in
the
morning
and
stayed
over
all
day
you
see
it
all
hangs
together
and
relieves
norman
entirely
of
the
reiberg
incident
and
jennie
and
cinches
his
blameless
presence
at
the
hotel
all
last
night
and
all
it
ll
save
everything
better
than
we
planned
couldn
t
be
better
rockwell
had
worked
himself
up
to
exultant
enthusiasm
merriam
s
emotions
while
this
new
plot
was
unfolded
were
sufficiently
complex
there
was
an
opaque
background
of
sheer
bewilderment
there
was
also
a
sharp
sense
of
alarm
at
the
thought
of
having
his
own
name
appear
in
this
business
but
other
sentiments
less
acute
individually
but
of
some
potency
none
the
less
joined
their
voices
with
rockwell
s
to
silence
that
alarm
there
was
the
mere
love
of
adventure
of
playing
a
dangerous
game
which
is
strong
in
any
healthy
young
man
then
there
was
the
thought
of
mollie
june
he
would
be
doing
it
for
her
making
a
real
sacrifice
of
his
reputation
possibly
of
his
position
his
pedagogical
career
for
her
sake
and
oddly
enough
quite
simultaneously
with
this
thought
of
mollie
june
there
was
a
recollection
of
jennie
s
voice
over
the
telephone
he
was
not
conscious
that
he
was
curious
to
see
jennie
but
i
am
afraid
he
was
scarcely
half
a
minute
had
passed
when
rockwell
eagerly
scanning
his
face
cried
you
ll
go
yes
said
merriam
looking
at
simpson
s
impassive
countenance
and
surprised
at
his
own
words
i
suppose
i
will
devious
rockwell
as
usual
gave
merriam
no
time
for
reconsideration
go
and
make
your
excuses
at
the
table
then
but
merriam
was
still
looking
at
simpson
he
had
perceived
that
the
impassivity
of
the
waiter
s
countenance
covered
a
blank
misery
simpson
he
said
we
ll
try
to
see
that
this
works
out
to
your
advantage
at
jennie
s
shake
on
that
and
in
violation
of
all
codes
on
which
the
social
system
rests
he
held
out
his
hand
as
one
man
to
another
simpson
much
more
rigorously
trained
in
those
codes
than
merriam
had
been
hesitated
glanced
at
rockwell
but
a
light
came
into
his
eyes
he
seized
the
hand
gripped
it
gave
one
spasmodic
shake
thank
you
sir
he
said
he
dropped
the
hand
and
as
quickly
as
possible
regained
his
servitorial
manner
merriam
smiled
at
him
and
then
spoke
to
rockwell
where
shall
i
join
you
murray
and
i
at
the
ladies
entrance
rockwell
replied
it
s
less
likely
to
be
watched
than
the
other
merriam
turned
and
passed
through
the
curtained
doorway
down
the
hall
and
along
one
side
of
the
peacock
cabaret
the
curtain
being
up
on
the
small
stage
and
the
moderately
comely
demoiselles
of
the
chorus
executing
a
dance
which
involved
a
liberal
display
of
white
tights
he
reached
his
alcove
comparatively
unnoticed
he
stopped
beside
mollie
june
s
chair
which
was
nearest
the
open
side
of
the
alcove
all
the
members
of
the
dinner
party
regarded
him
anxiously
aunt
mary
s
face
was
more
than
usually
grim
carefully
pitching
his
voice
so
that
it
should
be
audible
to
all
at
the
table
yet
should
not
carry
to
the
main
dining
room
without
he
said
i
am
tremendously
sorry
to
have
to
desert
this
pleasant
company
but
rockwell
and
i
are
called
away
on
important
business
we
should
be
very
glad
if
you
will
come
too
father
can
you
come
at
once
he
added
as
the
priest
stared
aunt
mary
s
lips
opened
i
ll
explain
later
said
merriam
hurriedly
as
he
spoke
however
he
realised
that
no
opportunity
to
explain
later
would
probably
be
afforded
him
alicia
had
said
they
all
would
go
to
see
him
in
the
morning
at
the
nestor
house
they
could
not
all
come
to
jennie
s
he
looked
down
at
mollie
june
she
was
looking
up
at
him
his
view
of
her
from
above
the
contour
of
her
face
and
throat
the
recalcitrant
wave
of
her
soft
hair
the
brightness
of
her
lifted
eyes
might
have
moved
older
and
colder
blood
than
merriam
s
he
was
close
enough
to
catch
a
faint
warm
sense
of
her
in
the
air
he
desired
to
envelop
her
in
love
what
he
might
do
he
could
not
resist
he
laid
his
hand
gently
over
one
of
hers
that
rested
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
bent
to
her
ear
rockwell
will
tell
you
what
i
have
done
he
whispered
it
is
for
your
sake
mollie
june
he
straightened
up
he
was
not
flushed
outwardly
he
looked
almost
cold
father
murray
was
making
his
way
down
the
side
of
the
table
good
night
all
said
merriam
this
way
father
murray
he
glanced
once
more
at
mollie
june
his
last
sight
of
her
he
thought
her
face
was
rosy
and
her
eyes
glistened
it
was
a
picture
for
which
a
man
a
very
young
man
at
least
might
do
anything
even
sacrifice
his
love
he
smiled
at
her
almost
gaily
turned
and
passed
out
of
the
alcove
father
murray
following
they
skirted
the
sides
of
the
peacock
cabaret
in
an
effort
to
reach
the
exit
as
little
observed
as
possible
unfortunately
before
they
attained
that
goal
the
curtain
of
the
small
stage
descended
the
white
legs
of
the
chorus
kicking
at
it
as
it
fell
were
hidden
from
the
attentive
eyes
of
the
male
diners
and
not
a
few
of
these
observed
the
famous
senator
s
escape
this
probably
mattered
little
however
because
of
father
murray
the
high
churchman
was
enough
to
shield
the
name
of
norman
he
could
hardly
be
bound
for
reiberg
s
or
even
it
would
be
argued
for
a
certain
little
flat
in
father
murray
s
company
they
got
their
coats
from
the
checkroom
went
up
the
stairs
to
the
first
floor
and
made
a
detour
through
passages
to
the
ladies
entrance
rockwell
was
already
there
with
a
taxicab
he
motioned
to
them
to
enter
it
merriam
was
a
little
surprised
and
father
murray
probably
more
so
to
find
simpson
already
within
father
murray
greeted
him
with
clerical
suavity
merriam
said
nothing
he
was
listening
to
rockwell
s
colloquy
with
the
chauffeur
this
cab
will
probably
be
followed
your
first
job
is
to
shake
off
pursuit
circle
around
through
the
loop
twist
and
turn
until
you
re
absolutely
sure
you
ve
lost
anybody
who
is
after
us
then
make
for
the
eighteenth
street
station
of
the
alley
if
there
s
no
one
behind
us
when
you
get
there
it
will
be
worth
dollars
to
you
above
the
fare
right
sir
said
the
man
jump
in
sir
rockwell
stepped
in
and
slammed
the
door
seating
himself
with
simpson
his
back
to
the
driver
in
a
moment
he
was
staring
intently
through
the
peephole
window
in
the
back
of
the
taxi
see
he
said
merriam
turning
to
look
over
his
shoulder
perceived
a
yellow
cab
about
sixty
feet
behind
them
also
starting
at
about
the
same
pace
as
their
own
they
went
west
to
fifth
avenue
and
turned
north
along
the
car
tracks
under
the
elevated
a
moment
later
the
yellow
cab
also
turned
north
on
the
car
tracks
they
swerved
east
on
randolph
street
for
a
minute
or
two
the
yellow
cab
did
not
appear
it
must
have
been
caught
behind
some
car
or
truck
but
presently
it
rounded
the
corner
and
sprinted
till
it
was
again
within
about
thirty
yards
of
them
when
it
slowed
down
to
their
own
pace
rockwell
spoke
through
the
tube
to
the
chauffeur
that
yellow
cab
i
ll
lose
em
the
man
replied
with
reassuring
confidence
at
the
second
corner
he
turned
north
again
and
sped
across
the
clark
street
bridge
the
yellow
cab
also
had
business
north
of
the
river
their
subsequent
maneuvers
were
at
first
decidedly
puzzling
to
merriam
and
his
fellow
passengers
with
the
possible
exception
of
simpson
they
sped
around
and
around
a
rectangle
of
streets
enclosing
half
a
dozen
squares
with
one
of
its
sides
only
one
block
from
the
river
on
the
shorter
sides
they
sometimes
lost
the
yellow
cab
but
on
the
longer
stretches
it
always
appeared
in
full
and
open
chase
behind
them
what
the
devil
cried
rockwell
as
their
driver
turned
west
for
the
fourth
time
on
the
southern
side
of
the
rectangle
the
street
nearest
the
river
simpson
spoke
he
s
all
right
it
s
the
bridge
trick
no
further
explanation
was
necessary
their
chauffeur
suddenly
swerved
south
on
dearborn
street
making
in
a
burst
of
speed
for
the
river
the
bridge
bell
was
jangling
its
warning
that
traffic
must
stop
for
the
opening
of
the
bridge
to
let
a
steamer
pass
theirs
was
the
last
vehicle
on
the
bridge
the
bars
dropped
behind
them
looking
back
through
the
peephole
window
our
passengers
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
yellow
cab
caught
behind
the
bars
unable
to
follow
them
unable
even
because
of
other
vehicles
crowding
behind
to
turn
out
and
make
a
detour
to
another
bridge
rockwell
excitedly
seized
the
tube
good
work
he
called
i
ll
give
you
another
ten
for
that
thank
you
sir
came
the
complacent
reply
with
a
sigh
of
relaxing
tension
merriam
sank
back
in
his
corner
abandoning
the
peephole
who
do
you
suppose
it
was
he
asked
thompson
oh
no
not
thompson
himself
one
of
his
henchmen
he
and
norman
have
all
kinds
of
assistants
where
are
we
going
asked
father
murray
rockwell
laughed
i
d
almost
forgotten
that
you
don
t
know
yet
i
ll
tell
you
and
he
entered
upon
an
explanation
of
thompson
s
discovery
and
proposed
method
of
verification
and
their
own
counterplot
father
murray
was
feebly
protesting
against
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
the
counterplot
but
these
complaints
were
interrupted
by
the
stopping
of
the
taxi
they
had
reached
the
eighteenth
street
station
of
the
elevated
rockwell
looked
quickly
through
the
peephole
window
and
then
opened
the
door
and
jumped
out
the
others
followed
they
scanned
the
street
in
both
directions
there
was
no
other
taxicab
in
sight
rockwell
stepped
up
to
the
smiling
chauffeur
asked
the
amount
of
the
fare
and
paid
it
with
the
dollars
bonus
you
did
the
trick
very
neatly
he
said
now
scoot
thank
you
sir
yes
sir
there
was
still
no
trace
of
curiosity
in
the
man
s
tone
or
glance
come
said
rockwell
and
he
led
them
to
the
entrance
of
the
elevated
station
at
street
they
left
the
elevated
and
walking
to
the
corner
waited
for
a
surface
car
what
s
the
idea
merriam
asked
his
mind
becoming
active
again
well
said
rockwell
the
first
thing
our
late
chauffeur
will
do
after
getting
back
to
town
will
be
to
gather
in
another
dollars
or
maybe
more
for
telling
some
one
of
thompson
s
men
where
he
left
us
so
it
s
best
to
muss
up
our
trail
a
bit
more
before
we
strike
jennie
s
he
was
hailing
an
car
as
they
sat
silent
again
inside
merriam
s
mind
took
its
cue
from
rockwell
s
last
word
jennie
s
phrases
from
his
one
brief
telephone
dialogue
with
jennie
sounded
in
his
ear
oddly
clear
and
melodious
georgie
boy
don
t
you
know
me
you
ought
to
with
a
thrilling
little
laugh
you
must
be
careful
georgie
in
a
lowered
tone
can
you
come
anyway
you
ll
telephone
again
georgie
boy
and
the
sound
of
a
kiss
these
phrases
surely
nothing
in
themselves
echoed
in
his
mind
with
the
same
unaccountable
piquancy
and
warmth
with
which
they
had
first
come
to
him
over
the
telephone
he
flushed
a
little
sitting
there
in
the
stuffy
bumping
jangling
car
as
he
recalled
the
way
he
had
involuntarily
played
up
to
them
he
had
promised
to
go
to
her
if
he
could
get
away
to
telephone
her
again
if
he
could
that
was
mere
trickery
and
deceit
a
part
of
the
game
he
was
playing
that
was
all
right
but
his
final
whispered
dearie
good
night
had
that
been
necessary
he
remembered
rockwell
s
dry
comment
you
don
t
need
much
prompting
but
his
thoughts
ran
away
with
him
again
now
he
was
going
to
see
her
to
spend
a
night
in
her
apartment
what
would
she
be
like
tall
or
short
slender
like
mollie
june
or
plump
like
alicia
fair
or
dark
with
blue
eyes
or
brown
or
black
curly
hair
or
straight
he
could
not
frame
an
image
that
satisfied
him
as
the
instrument
of
that
voice
well
what
is
it
to
me
he
demanded
roughly
of
himself
suddenly
realising
the
tenor
of
his
meditations
see
here
my
boy
you
must
be
careful
she
s
probably
a
regular
chorus
girl
or
worse
but
he
did
not
really
believe
that
of
her
she
s
nothing
whatever
to
me
he
asserted
sternly
to
his
truant
fancy
she
belongs
to
simpson
and
i
belong
to
mollie
june
the
car
stopped
at
last
and
rockwell
was
getting
up
when
they
had
descended
into
the
street
merriam
found
that
they
were
at
the
end
of
the
line
by
the
lake
illinois
central
next
said
rockwell
grinning
and
marched
them
to
the
street
station
of
that
railway
none
of
the
others
spoke
their
guide
bought
tickets
to
the
city
are
we
going
back
to
the
loop
then
thought
merriam
in
a
moment
they
were
on
the
platform
merriam
walked
back
and
forth
apart
from
the
others
drawing
deep
breaths
of
the
lake
air
and
looking
up
at
the
stars
dimly
bright
in
the
april
night
i
belong
to
mollie
june
he
said
firmly
to
himself
presently
one
of
the
odd
little
suburban
trains
drew
up
and
they
entered
but
they
had
scarcely
sat
down
and
yielded
up
their
tickets
when
rockwell
routed
them
out
at
street
evidently
his
buying
tickets
clear
to
the
city
had
been
a
part
of
his
elaborate
ruse
rockwell
went
at
once
to
a
telephone
to
call
up
a
neighbouring
garage
merriam
took
a
cigarette
and
lighted
it
and
again
walked
up
and
down
his
thoughts
now
ran
unbidden
upon
mollie
june
images
of
her
crowded
his
mind
mollie
june
rosy
and
as
he
had
seen
her
last
at
the
dinner
table
in
the
alcove
of
the
peacock
cabaret
mollie
june
by
his
sick
bed
standing
over
him
after
he
had
impulsively
declared
his
love
her
hand
hovering
above
his
hair
tears
upon
her
face
turning
bravely
away
from
him
mollie
june
above
the
roses
as
he
had
first
seen
her
that
morning
was
it
only
that
morning
lifting
the
wet
stems
from
the
bowl
mollie
june
confronting
mayor
black
refusing
in
angered
innocence
to
leave
the
room
mollie
june
in
the
peacock
cabaret
the
night
before
mollie
june
in
the
front
row
in
senior
algebra
back
in
riceville
ah
he
belong
to
mollie
june
heart
and
soul
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
and
all
the
jennies
in
the
world
were
of
no
account
whatever
so
it
was
a
young
man
in
a
very
laudable
frame
of
mind
indeed
waiving
the
fact
that
mollie
june
was
a
married
woman
whom
rockwell
presently
bundled
into
the
taxi
he
had
summoned
father
murray
was
already
inside
rockwell
followed
leaving
simpson
to
speak
to
the
chauffeur
it
puzzled
merriam
to
find
simpson
thus
placed
in
command
as
it
were
and
his
thoughts
came
back
to
the
present
adventure
he
listened
closely
stop
first
at
rankin
s
hardware
store
simpson
said
to
the
chauffeur
on
street
in
a
couple
of
minutes
it
seemed
they
stopped
before
rankin
s
emporium
simpson
alone
descended
the
other
three
remained
in
the
taxicab
rockwell
openly
smiling
at
the
puzzled
inquiry
on
merriam
s
face
but
vouchsafing
no
enlightenment
merriam
would
not
ask
questions
the
hardware
shop
was
closed
but
there
was
a
light
within
and
a
man
simpson
pounded
at
the
door
till
he
gained
admittance
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
bearing
a
small
stepladder
what
on
earth
the
words
were
almost
starting
from
merriam
s
lips
but
he
managed
to
swallow
them
and
listened
again
for
simpson
s
direction
to
the
driver
it
was
an
address
dalton
place
that
meant
nothing
to
merriam
again
a
brief
drive
merriam
laboriously
cogitating
with
bewildered
eyes
on
the
small
ladder
an
affair
of
some
six
steps
which
simpson
had
brought
into
the
cab
and
was
holding
upright
between
them
father
murray
asked
the
question
which
merriam
had
so
manfully
and
youthfully
repressed
what
s
that
for
you
ll
see
said
rockwell
grinning
enjoying
the
mystery
simpson
remained
as
silent
and
grave
as
an
undertaker
the
taxicab
had
turned
several
corners
and
covered
perhaps
a
couple
of
miles
of
streets
now
it
slowed
down
stopped
there
ain
t
no
said
the
driver
through
the
tube
rockwell
took
command
again
isn
t
there
he
said
let
s
see
he
got
out
peering
through
the
open
door
of
the
taxicab
merriam
could
see
that
the
house
before
which
they
had
stopped
was
numbered
s
a
vacant
lot
he
heard
the
chauffeur
say
so
it
seems
rockwell
replied
well
we
ll
get
out
here
anyway
merriam
eagerly
took
this
cue
and
the
other
two
followed
simpson
bringing
his
ladder
rockwell
was
handing
a
couple
of
green
bills
to
the
driver
drive
on
opposite
where
ought
to
be
he
said
and
wait
we
ll
be
back
by
and
by
this
way
he
added
and
started
with
merriam
and
father
murray
down
the
street
past
the
vacant
lot
simpson
carrying
his
small
stepladder
as
unobtrusively
as
possible
at
his
side
followed
laggingly
behind
the
square
beyond
the
next
avenue
seemed
to
be
occupied
entirely
by
a
huge
block
of
apartments
they
did
not
cross
the
avenue
but
turned
the
corner
and
walked
on
down
one
side
of
the
great
flat
building
but
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
their
side
held
a
miscellany
of
small
detached
houses
merriam
glanced
at
rockwell
he
was
slowing
his
steps
and
seemed
to
be
watching
a
couple
of
men
who
were
moving
in
the
same
direction
as
their
own
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
immediately
under
the
apartments
a
moment
later
these
two
men
turned
in
at
one
of
the
entrances
of
the
flat
building
after
perhaps
twenty
feet
more
rockwell
glanced
over
his
shoulder
merriam
involuntarily
did
likewise
half
a
block
behind
them
was
simpson
with
his
ladder
there
was
no
one
else
in
sight
rockwell
stopped
for
a
second
then
said
come
and
quickly
crossed
the
street
and
entered
another
door
of
the
flat
building
within
the
vestibule
he
stopped
again
we
must
wait
for
simpson
he
said
he
began
reading
the
names
below
the
battery
of
bells
merriam
and
father
murray
stared
at
each
other
in
a
moment
simpson
joined
them
with
his
ladder
rockwell
promptly
opened
the
inner
door
of
the
vestibule
and
proceeded
to
ascend
the
stairs
simpson
trudged
after
him
and
merriam
and
the
priest
followed
perforce
they
reached
the
second
floor
and
the
third
and
continued
on
up
to
the
fourth
which
was
the
top
floor
arriving
there
merriam
found
rockwell
pointing
to
a
sort
of
trapdoor
in
the
ceiling
above
the
landing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
right
he
whispered
simpson
calmly
set
his
ladder
down
separated
its
legs
and
planted
it
firmly
beneath
the
trap
he
and
rockwell
paid
no
attention
to
the
doors
of
the
two
apartments
which
opened
off
the
landing
within
a
few
feet
of
them
simpson
amended
the
ladder
and
exerting
his
strength
pushed
the
trap
door
up
it
moved
with
a
grating
sound
startlingly
loud
in
their
situation
the
night
air
rushed
in
the
trap
gave
upon
the
roof
of
the
building
simpson
did
not
hesitate
but
pulled
himself
up
on
to
the
roof
rockwell
followed
you
re
to
come
too
he
said
as
he
looked
down
at
merriam
gleefully
and
winked
he
was
evidently
pleased
with
himself
you
wait
here
father
murray
remember
if
any
one
comes
you
re
a
roof
inspector
that
s
next
door
to
a
sky
pilot
anyway
the
priest
groaned
but
made
no
protest
well
knowing
doubtless
that
rebellion
now
would
avail
him
naught
and
merriam
quickly
followed
rockwell
on
to
the
roof
it
was
a
flat
roof
not
an
unpleasant
place
to
be
in
the
starry
april
night
they
circled
about
chimneys
and
miscellaneous
pipe
heads
and
stepped
across
brick
ledges
which
seemed
to
separate
different
sections
of
the
building
from
one
another
presently
they
were
approaching
the
opposite
side
of
the
building
having
circled
the
interior
court
and
light
wells
they
came
to
another
a
twin
of
the
one
by
which
they
had
ascended
simpson
was
about
to
open
this
second
trap
when
rockwell
spoke
wait
a
minute
stooping
lower
and
lower
till
at
last
he
seemed
to
be
almost
sitting
on
his
heels
as
he
walked
he
made
his
way
to
the
edge
of
the
roof
on
the
new
street
and
peeped
over
the
parapet
a
dozen
feet
perhaps
beyond
the
trapdoor
for
a
moment
only
he
looked
then
returned
in
the
same
cautious
and
laborious
manner
we
were
right
he
said
to
simpson
watchers
simpson
asked
two
of
them
and
half
way
down
the
block
a
taxi
but
now
simpson
was
carefully
raising
the
after
listening
for
a
minute
he
put
his
head
down
and
looked
coast
is
clear
he
reported
go
ahead
then
said
rockwell
so
simpson
put
his
legs
down
inside
hung
and
dropped
into
the
vestibule
rockwell
and
merriam
followed
straightening
himself
up
inside
merriam
found
rockwell
facing
the
door
of
the
apartment
this
is
jennie
s
he
whispered
rockwell
knocked
twice
a
girl
with
a
thin
dark
face
peeped
out
hello
margery
said
rockwell
oh
how
d
you
do
said
the
girl
recognizing
the
speaker
relief
was
mingled
in
her
tone
with
continuing
caution
who
s
with
you
friends
said
rockwell
merriam
the
senator
s
double
and
simpson
simpson
can
t
come
here
said
margery
sharply
merriam
glanced
at
simpson
and
was
amazed
to
see
how
moved
he
was
he
had
a
sense
that
the
man
could
hardly
keep
himself
from
trembling
he
s
come
to
help
take
norman
away
said
rockwell
he
need
go
no
farther
than
the
hall
come
margery
let
us
in
we
can
t
stand
here
all
night
i
ll
explain
to
both
of
you
inside
i
m
george
s
friend
you
know
well
still
unwillingly
margery
released
the
chain
and
moved
back
opening
the
door
for
them
as
they
stepped
inside
she
stared
at
merriam
the
devil
she
exclaimed
no
said
the
young
man
my
name
s
merriam
how
do
you
do
miss
milton
he
looked
at
margery
almost
as
curiously
as
she
was
looking
at
him
he
was
really
as
innocent
as
mollie
june
more
so
in
fact
not
being
married
and
margery
was
the
first
member
of
the
or
the
near
demimonde
with
whom
he
had
ever
had
personal
contact
he
found
her
disappointing
she
was
thin
to
the
point
of
angularity
in
a
trying
yellow
negligee
with
straight
black
hair
black
eyes
that
were
unpleasantly
direct
and
a
lean
dark
face
that
was
undeniably
hard
for
a
moment
only
she
stared
then
she
shut
the
door
and
spoke
to
simpson
you
stay
here
yes
said
simpson
with
more
than
servitorial
humility
rockwell
was
advancing
into
the
sitting
room
which
opened
immediately
off
the
tiny
hall
and
merriam
feeling
himself
dismissed
by
miss
milton
followed
merriam
s
sole
first
impression
of
the
sitting
room
was
of
a
soft
rather
agreeable
harmony
in
yellow
the
wall
paper
the
hangings
the
upholstery
of
chairs
and
davenport
the
shades
of
lights
were
all
in
mild
tints
of
that
pleasant
colour
probably
margery
s
yellow
negligee
was
intended
to
fit
into
this
ensemble
but
he
had
no
time
for
detailed
observation
for
as
they
stepped
forward
the
yellow
portières
at
one
side
of
the
room
parted
and
another
girl
appeared
between
them
undoubtedly
jennie
this
time
he
was
surprised
but
hardly
disappointed
the
figure
between
the
portières
was
that
of
a
stage
parlour
maid
just
the
right
height
for
a
soubrette
and
just
pleasantly
youthfully
slender
yet
rounded
in
a
dress
of
some
black
material
cut
rather
low
at
the
throat
and
edged
with
white
with
a
ridiculously
small
purely
ornamental
white
apron
with
pockets
ankles
and
black
satin
pumps
completed
a
picture
that
was
both
chic
and
demure
merriam
remembered
that
it
was
as
a
parlour
maid
that
norman
had
first
known
jennie
and
guessed
that
this
costume
had
been
assumed
for
his
benefit
in
a
moment
the
portières
closed
behind
her
she
was
looking
at
the
older
man
having
barely
glanced
at
merriam
how
do
rockwell
she
said
merriam
almost
with
alarm
recognised
the
tones
that
had
so
piqued
him
over
the
telephone
then
she
turned
to
him
this
is
gee
but
you
re
like
him
i
wouldn
t
have
believed
it
miss
higgins
merriam
said
rockwell
tardily
merriam
responded
awkwardly
how
do
you
do
miss
miss
jennie
will
do
interrupted
jennie
merriam
remembered
uncomfortably
how
mollie
june
had
hit
upon
a
similar
compromise
i
ain
t
partial
to
higgins
jennie
added
i
m
thinking
of
changing
it
to
wouldn
t
jennie
montmorency
be
nice
mr
rockwell
i
don
t
think
it
fits
very
well
said
rockwell
you
d
better
change
it
to
simpson
jennie
coloured
she
coloured
easily
as
merriam
was
to
learn
now
that
she
had
turned
again
to
rockwell
he
had
a
chance
to
look
at
her
face
she
was
an
exceedingly
pretty
blonde
her
throat
was
attractively
rounded
her
shoulders
also
those
shoulders
might
be
unpleasant
when
she
was
older
and
stouter
but
at
present
they
were
charming
her
chin
and
cheeks
were
also
daintily
full
quite
the
opposite
of
margery
milton
s
the
cheeks
were
pink
slightly
heightened
with
rouge
perhaps
but
not
with
paint
the
eyes
were
softly
brightly
blue
the
hair
fair
and
smoothly
wavy
if
one
may
attempt
to
express
a
nuance
by
combining
contradictory
terms
in
short
she
was
as
some
of
her
admirers
undoubtedly
expressed
it
not
a
bit
hard
to
look
at
for
a
moment
jennie
s
colour
flooded
then
came
her
retort
to
rockwell
mind
your
own
business
she
said
the
words
were
sharp
but
somehow
the
tone
was
not
the
voice
was
still
soft
and
warm
it
is
the
only
word
it
was
the
voice
one
might
attribute
to
a
kitten
if
a
kitten
were
gifted
with
articulate
speech
rockwell
only
laughed
at
the
same
moment
margery
milton
entered
from
the
hall
where
she
had
presumably
been
impressing
upon
simpson
the
necessity
of
remaining
in
strict
hiding
jennie
glanced
at
her
friend
well
she
said
may
as
well
sit
down
she
dropped
into
a
chair
and
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
you
ve
come
to
take
georgie
away
she
continued
as
the
others
sat
down
yes
said
rockwell
listen
jennie
you
too
margery
and
he
began
to
explain
the
new
situation
which
had
resulted
primarily
from
margery
s
confidences
to
thompson
he
did
not
soften
this
point
in
his
relation
see
what
your
gabbling
s
done
said
jennie
without
anger
to
her
friend
when
he
had
finished
you
always
talk
too
much
i
can
talk
if
i
please
said
margery
sullenly
it
will
pay
you
better
to
keep
still
this
time
said
rockwell
pay
me
how
much
demanded
margery
promptly
say
a
hundred
dollars
a
hundred
i
m
mum
as
a
stone
image
when
do
i
get
it
though
here
s
twenty
now
on
account
rockwell
held
out
a
bill
which
margery
quickly
accepted
you
get
the
rest
when
this
is
all
over
how
do
i
know
i
get
the
rest
shut
up
marge
said
jennie
you
know
mr
rockwell
we
ve
no
time
to
lose
rockwell
continued
looking
at
his
watch
it
s
minutes
to
ten
now
thompson
said
ten
but
he
might
come
a
bit
sooner
we
must
get
norman
away
at
once
you
understand
that
you
re
to
let
merriam
go
to
bed
in
his
stead
when
thompson
comes
you
must
admit
him
you
can
pretend
to
be
unwilling
to
do
so
but
you
must
let
him
in
without
too
much
fuss
you
re
to
tell
him
that
norman
s
not
here
and
has
not
been
here
that
there
s
a
man
here
who
looks
tremendously
like
norman
and
that
at
first
you
fooled
margery
into
thinking
it
was
norman
while
rockwell
was
issuing
these
instructions
jennie
s
cheeks
had
grown
hot
i
m
not
that
kind
she
cried
i
ve
never
had
any
one
but
george
margery
also
glowered
i
know
that
my
dear
said
rockwell
mendaciously
perhaps
but
promptly
but
you
ve
got
to
do
what
i
tell
you
you
don
t
care
what
a
fellow
like
thompson
thinks
he
always
thinks
the
worst
anyhow
it
s
to
save
george
he
ll
be
ruined
unless
we
can
fool
thompson
completely
it
s
for
george
he
repeated
you
d
do
a
lot
for
george
jennie
s
colour
was
subsiding
she
had
uncrossed
her
legs
and
was
sitting
erect
she
looked
fixedly
at
rockwell
i
done
a
lot
for
him
she
said
i
know
said
rockwell
and
you
ll
do
this
he
was
using
his
most
persuasive
tones
jennie
stole
an
almost
timid
glance
at
merriam
the
latter
s
youthful
chivalry
was
aroused
he
was
filled
with
pity
for
her
mingled
with
something
like
admiration
on
account
of
her
prettiness
he
saw
her
more
or
less
correctly
as
a
pathetic
victim
of
real
love
and
a
false
social
system
he
smiled
at
her
reassuringly
it
ll
be
all
right
he
said
i
shan
t
trouble
you
at
all
jennie
s
glance
lingered
on
his
face
the
face
that
was
so
much
like
norman
s
she
saw
him
for
the
clean
innocent
naïve
boy
that
he
was
he
was
what
george
norman
might
once
have
been
long
years
ago
i
am
afraid
that
something
akin
to
interest
crept
into
her
look
she
dropped
her
eyes
all
right
she
said
curtly
to
rockwell
i
suppose
i
will
jennie
you
re
a
fool
cried
margery
shut
up
marge
said
jennie
with
whom
this
seemed
to
be
a
frequent
locution
rockwell
had
already
risen
is
george
dressed
he
asked
no
said
jennie
he
s
too
sick
come
then
said
rockwell
to
merriam
we
must
help
him
into
his
things
he
crossed
the
small
room
and
passed
through
the
yellow
portières
having
been
at
the
apartment
earlier
in
the
day
with
aunt
mary
he
was
acquainted
with
its
geography
merriam
rose
to
follow
but
he
felt
that
something
more
ought
to
be
said
to
relieve
the
awkwardness
of
the
situation
jennie
s
eyes
were
still
cast
down
is
he
pretty
sick
he
asked
as
he
moved
across
the
room
he
was
not
much
concerned
about
senator
norman
but
he
could
think
of
no
other
remark
jennie
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
an
unreadable
glance
pretty
sick
she
said
almost
indifferently
merriam
paused
a
moment
before
the
portières
looking
back
still
meeting
her
eyes
then
he
turned
his
own
away
and
pushed
the
portières
aside
he
found
himself
in
a
dining
room
done
entirely
in
blue
as
the
sitting
room
was
in
yellow
rockwell
was
already
opening
a
door
on
the
further
side
merriam
quickened
his
steps
and
was
close
behind
the
older
man
in
entering
a
small
white
bedroom
on
a
single
bed
therein
lay
senator
george
norman
evidently
he
had
heard
their
voices
in
the
sitting
room
for
he
had
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
he
and
merriam
stared
at
each
other
in
the
amazement
that
is
inevitable
to
two
men
who
find
themselves
really
bearing
a
striking
physical
resemblance
to
each
other
however
much
they
may
have
been
forewarned
we
are
so
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
each
of
us
has
a
sort
of
exclusive
copyright
on
his
own
particular
exterior
that
we
can
not
seriously
believe
in
anything
approaching
a
replica
unless
actually
confronted
with
it
the
senator
did
not
look
especially
boyish
as
he
lay
there
his
ruffled
hair
was
indeed
practically
untouched
with
gray
but
his
cheeks
were
haggard
and
feverish
and
there
were
many
little
wrinkles
about
his
mouth
and
eyes
for
all
that
merriam
could
hardly
believe
he
was
not
looking
into
a
mirror
the
experience
was
hardly
pleasant
for
either
man
this
is
what
i
shall
be
like
some
time
when
i
am
old
and
ill
merriam
thought
and
the
senator
can
hardly
have
escaped
the
bitter
reflection
of
the
man
who
has
left
many
years
behind
him
that
is
what
i
was
once
looking
closer
merriam
could
detect
slight
differences
the
lips
and
nostrils
of
his
distinguished
relative
were
undoubtedly
a
little
fuller
than
his
own
and
yes
he
surely
was
not
flattering
himself
in
thinking
that
the
chin
was
rounder
and
weaker
but
above
all
such
trivial
points
the
likeness
rose
overwhelmingly
incredibly
complete
merriam
even
recognised
a
similarity
of
movement
as
the
sick
man
impatiently
twisted
himself
on
the
bed
rockwell
was
standing
silent
also
no
doubt
inspecting
the
resemblance
of
which
he
had
made
such
remarkable
use
the
senator
was
the
first
to
find
his
tongue
so
you
re
my
virtuous
double
he
said
with
a
sort
of
petulant
scorn
the
voice
too
rockwell
thought
he
almost
dreaded
to
hear
merriam
s
reply
which
would
echo
the
very
quality
and
timbre
of
the
other
s
speech
as
if
he
were
mocking
him
but
merriam
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
fact
is
one
can
not
judge
the
sound
of
one
s
own
voice
nor
appreciate
the
similarity
in
another
s
tones
or
in
an
imitation
i
m
the
double
merriam
was
saying
for
a
moment
longer
the
senator
stared
then
he
laughed
he
evidently
laughed
more
easily
than
merriam
and
somewhat
differently
merriam
made
a
mental
note
that
if
he
should
be
involved
in
any
further
impersonation
he
must
be
careful
of
his
laugh
well
it
s
rather
convenient
just
this
minute
said
norman
none
too
courteously
though
it
may
be
damned
inconvenient
in
the
end
we
ll
help
you
dress
said
rockwell
we
ve
come
to
take
you
to
the
hotel
you
know
yes
i
know
that
all
right
said
norman
if
i
m
to
be
a
damned
reformer
i
must
get
out
of
this
he
laughed
again
hand
me
those
trousers
will
you
he
put
his
legs
out
of
the
bed
he
had
already
dressed
himself
as
far
as
his
shirt
then
he
had
apparently
given
the
job
up
and
got
back
into
bed
i
m
weak
as
a
kitten
he
continued
and
i
ve
the
deuce
of
a
fever
but
i
guess
i
can
make
it
you
ve
a
taxi
of
course
yes
said
rockwell
he
did
not
tell
norman
that
the
road
to
the
taxi
lay
through
two
trapdoors
and
across
a
roof
neither
did
he
mention
the
fact
that
merriam
was
to
stay
at
jennie
s
or
allude
to
thompson
s
coming
perhaps
he
feared
that
if
norman
knew
of
thompson
s
approach
he
would
prefer
to
stay
where
he
was
and
join
forces
with
him
again
in
a
very
few
minutes
norman
was
fully
dressed
in
the
evening
clothes
in
which
he
had
left
the
hotel
the
night
before
on
his
way
as
he
supposed
to
mayor
black
s
rockwell
tied
his
white
bow
for
him
during
the
process
of
dressing
he
and
merriam
were
continually
glancing
at
each
other
neither
could
resist
the
attraction
several
times
they
caught
each
other
at
it
at
about
their
third
mutual
detection
which
happened
during
the
tying
of
the
bow
norman
laughed
again
we
re
certainly
a
pair
he
said
whether
aces
or
deuces
remains
to
be
seen
eh
gad
but
i
m
weak
he
added
sinking
on
to
the
bed
as
rockwell
finished
his
job
you
may
have
to
carry
me
downstairs
we
ll
carry
you
all
right
said
rockwell
we
re
all
ready
aren
t
we
i
suppose
so
said
norman
rockwell
stooped
and
picked
him
up
in
his
arms
exerting
himself
only
moderately
apparently
in
so
doing
the
senator
was
light
on
account
of
his
carefully
preserved
slenderness
and
rockwell
was
really
very
strong
bring
his
hat
merriam
said
the
latter
rockwell
carried
him
through
the
blue
dining
room
into
the
sitting
room
merriam
following
with
the
silk
hat
both
jennie
and
margery
were
standing
norman
waved
his
hand
limply
to
jennie
over
rockwell
s
shoulder
pet
he
said
i
m
all
in
you
see
sorry
to
have
bothered
you
like
this
when
i
wasn
t
fit
georgie
boy
cried
jennie
with
a
little
run
she
came
up
behind
rockwell
caught
norman
s
hand
and
kissed
it
you
ll
let
me
know
how
you
are
you
ll
come
back
course
i
will
said
norman
though
he
had
promised
aunt
mary
that
afternoon
that
he
would
cut
out
jennie
and
the
whole
of
that
part
of
his
life
to
which
she
belonged
it
may
be
that
jennie
suspected
something
of
the
sort
there
were
tears
in
her
bright
soft
eyes
and
her
cheeks
were
pale
enough
to
make
her
slight
rouging
obvious
you
will
won
t
you
she
said
come
soon
georgie
boy
norman
only
smiled
at
her
and
feebly
waved
again
rockwell
meanwhile
was
moving
towards
the
hallway
jennie
followed
closely
though
margery
tried
to
prevent
her
let
them
go
jen
whispered
margery
shut
up
marge
said
jennie
almost
fiercely
and
then
the
catastrophe
which
margery
had
been
trying
to
forestall
and
which
rockwell
had
not
sufficiently
foreseen
or
else
had
not
cared
to
prevent
occurred
jennie
came
face
to
face
with
simpson
in
the
little
hallway
she
stopped
short
you
she
said
yes
miss
jennie
said
simpson
looking
at
her
steadily
i
didn
t
mean
you
should
see
me
i
came
to
help
take
norman
away
it
was
me
that
discovered
the
plan
to
catch
him
here
jennie
knew
from
rockwell
s
earlier
explanation
that
this
was
true
she
tried
to
give
simpson
what
she
herself
would
probably
have
called
the
a
scornful
survey
from
head
to
foot
but
her
histrionic
purpose
failed
her
her
eyes
fell
too
quickly
well
be
quick
about
it
she
said
for
the
first
time
her
voice
was
harsh
rockwell
meanwhile
had
carried
norman
on
into
the
outer
hall
for
simpson
had
already
opened
the
door
and
set
him
down
leaning
against
the
banister
margery
he
called
sharply
margery
glad
of
any
diversion
advanced
quickly
what
do
you
want
a
stepladder
got
one
why
yes
go
with
her
simpson
and
get
it
rockwell
commanded
yes
mr
rockwell
this
way
said
margery
and
she
and
simpson
passed
by
jennie
and
merriam
who
stood
a
little
behind
jennie
and
disappeared
into
the
flat
jennie
gave
one
quick
look
at
norman
who
was
leaning
weakly
against
the
railing
staring
in
front
of
him
turned
away
with
eyes
that
were
very
bright
and
a
little
hard
brushed
past
merriam
and
went
back
into
the
sitting
room
and
sat
down
almost
at
the
same
moment
simpson
returned
carrying
a
rather
tall
stepladder
and
followed
by
margery
norman
came
out
of
his
apathy
and
stared
simpson
set
the
ladder
up
in
the
center
of
the
hall
mounted
it
and
climbed
through
the
trap
which
they
had
left
open
when
they
descended
here
catch
said
rockwell
he
tossed
norman
s
silk
hat
up
through
the
trap
and
simpson
caught
it
then
he
stooped
picked
norman
up
again
and
began
to
mount
the
ladder
with
him
what
in
hell
said
the
sick
man
rockwell
did
not
reply
but
continued
to
mount
and
then
hoisted
the
senator
up
so
that
simpson
could
catch
him
under
the
arms
and
draw
him
through
the
trap
finally
he
spoke
to
merriam
take
this
ladder
inside
then
you
must
go
straight
to
bed
he
ll
be
here
any
time
now
i
ll
phone
from
the
hotel
when
we
get
there
he
swung
himself
up
on
to
the
roof
the
trap
closed
well
i
ll
be
damned
said
margery
milton
merriam
did
not
like
profanity
in
women
even
in
margeries
very
likely
you
will
he
said
margery
looked
at
him
sharply
you
think
you
re
smart
don
t
you
are
you
going
to
bring
that
ladder
in
new
merriam
shut
the
stepladder
together
lifted
it
into
an
oblique
position
and
carried
it
through
the
inner
hallway
into
the
sitting
room
where
he
stopped
not
knowing
where
to
go
with
it
jennie
was
still
sitting
she
looked
up
at
him
the
same
expression
of
interest
which
had
showed
in
her
eyes
once
before
returned
to
them
she
smiled
and
shifted
her
position
crossing
her
knees
but
she
volunteered
no
information
as
to
what
he
should
do
with
the
stepladder
which
he
was
awkwardly
holding
meanwhile
margery
had
followed
him
into
the
inner
hall
closed
the
door
and
put
up
the
chain
she
now
came
past
him
and
pushed
aside
the
portières
into
the
dining
room
bring
it
this
way
please
she
said
quite
politely
he
carried
the
ladder
through
the
blue
dining
room
into
a
kitchenette
and
thence
through
a
door
which
margery
held
open
on
to
a
narrow
back
porch
from
which
he
had
a
glimpse
of
a
sort
of
orderly
labyrinth
of
steep
wooden
stairs
and
narrow
back
porches
around
the
four
sides
of
an
inner
court
he
returned
into
the
kitchenette
which
was
almost
entirely
filled
up
with
a
gas
stove
margery
shut
the
door
go
into
the
sitting
room
and
talk
to
jen
she
said
i
want
her
to
forget
about
simpson
i
ll
change
the
bed
for
you
thank
you
said
merriam
who
began
to
perceive
that
miss
milton
in
spite
of
her
profanity
had
certain
admirable
qualities
he
went
through
the
dining
room
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
the
portières
he
could
not
have
said
why
and
then
pushed
them
open
jennie
had
risen
and
was
standing
beside
a
table
between
the
windows
the
table
held
a
lamp
a
newspaper
a
small
camera
and
a
bowl
of
violets
merriam
had
not
noticed
the
flowers
before
he
remembered
the
violets
worn
by
the
floor
clerk
at
the
hotel
and
wondered
whether
george
norman
had
saved
himself
trouble
at
the
florist
s
by
ordering
two
bunches
from
the
same
lot
to
be
sent
to
different
addresses
jennie
was
looking
down
at
the
flowers
she
must
have
been
aware
of
his
presence
if
so
she
was
apparently
content
that
he
should
have
the
benefit
of
a
good
look
at
her
trim
figure
and
at
her
face
in
profile
which
was
its
best
view
she
had
a
pretty
nose
the
artificially
heightened
colour
of
her
cheeks
was
charming
in
this
light
and
the
bright
knob
of
her
fair
hair
over
her
ear
was
a
most
alluring
ornament
in
a
moment
she
bent
gracefully
down
to
smell
the
violets
as
she
straightened
up
she
turned
to
look
at
him
a
serious
appraising
look
that
was
somehow
intimate
then
she
smiled
brightly
come
in
she
seemed
to
forget
his
name
and
let
it
go
and
sit
down
she
tripped
across
the
room
to
the
davenport
and
sat
indicating
that
he
was
to
sit
beside
her
merriam
wanted
both
to
take
that
seat
and
not
to
take
it
he
took
it
she
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
and
looked
at
him
smiling
one
small
squarish
plump
hand
lay
on
her
knee
ready
merriam
half
divined
to
be
taken
if
any
one
should
desire
to
take
it
he
wondered
if
it
were
true
that
she
had
never
had
any
one
but
george
i
forget
your
name
she
said
confidentially
merriam
it
was
not
said
stiffly
he
was
too
much
attracted
to
be
stiff
he
realised
that
he
was
answering
her
smile
what
s
your
first
name
john
then
i
shall
call
you
i
don
t
like
last
names
and
mister
and
they
re
stiff
he
said
playing
up
alarmingly
as
on
a
former
occasion
she
scrutinised
his
face
growing
grave
you
re
awfully
like
george
she
said
except
here
she
raised
her
hand
and
with
the
tip
of
her
forefinger
touched
his
chin
you
re
sterner
she
added
it
was
the
very
point
merriam
himself
had
noted
he
admired
her
acuteness
of
observation
and
of
course
he
was
flattered
but
he
realised
that
he
was
not
being
particularly
stern
at
that
moment
i
expect
i
am
he
said
trying
to
look
if
not
to
be
more
so
jennie
moved
an
inch
or
two
farther
away
from
him
as
if
a
little
frightened
by
the
iron
qualities
of
this
male
where
s
margery
she
asked
here
said
margery
s
voice
with
disconcerting
patness
she
came
through
the
portières
and
surveyed
the
two
of
them
with
an
ironical
look
that
was
by
no
means
lost
on
merriam
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
but
jennie
gave
him
a
quick
glance
with
a
little
pout
in
it
as
if
to
say
what
a
nuisance
when
we
were
just
beginning
to
get
acquainted
and
straightway
his
shame
fled
and
he
smiled
at
her
margery
however
was
speaking
in
her
most
businesslike
tones
i
ve
changed
your
bed
and
you
d
better
get
into
it
as
quick
as
you
can
it
s
late
now
yes
said
merriam
rising
what
time
is
it
before
he
could
get
out
his
own
timepiece
jennie
raised
her
arm
and
glanced
at
a
small
gold
wrist
watch
oh
five
minutes
after
ten
she
cried
she
rose
too
you
must
hurry
yes
said
merriam
he
moved
to
the
portières
hesitated
he
did
not
know
how
to
take
leave
under
these
novel
circumstances
good
night
ladies
he
ventured
in
rather
ceremonious
tones
to
his
chagrin
both
girls
burst
out
laughing
good
night
gentleman
jennie
called
merrily
after
him
and
their
renewed
giggling
pursued
him
as
in
painful
confusion
he
crossed
to
the
door
of
the
bedroom
he
shut
that
door
behind
him
and
rapidly
undressed
stimulated
to
speed
in
his
operations
by
a
vigorous
mental
kicking
of
himself
as
an
ass
and
a
boob
a
suit
of
pajamas
apparently
quite
new
was
laid
out
on
a
chair
he
got
into
these
and
slipped
into
bed
the
moment
he
was
recumbent
he
realised
that
he
had
forgotten
to
turn
out
his
light
no
matter
he
had
no
idea
of
sleeping
besides
thompson
would
be
there
any
minute
ah
thompson
with
relief
his
mind
seized
upon
this
topic
it
was
sufficiently
absorbing
any
minute
now
thompson
would
burst
in
demanding
senator
norman
he
merriam
would
pretend
he
had
never
seen
thompson
before
never
even
heard
of
him
my
name
is
not
norman
he
would
say
my
name
is
merriam
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
thompson
would
stare
falter
begin
to
apologise
and
explain
it
was
pleasingly
dramatic
he
pursued
the
interview
his
own
conduct
therein
displayed
the
quintessence
of
composure
and
jennie
and
margery
yes
both
of
them
were
present
would
be
impressed
they
would
laugh
at
him
no
longer
thompson
was
sacrificed
mercilessly
but
the
minutes
passed
and
nothing
happened
there
was
no
sign
of
the
real
thompson
what
was
wrong
the
silence
of
the
small
lighted
bedroom
began
to
get
on
merriam
s
excited
nerves
had
thompson
somehow
in
spite
of
rockwell
s
elaborate
precautions
got
wind
of
the
real
situation
discovered
their
trick
before
it
was
played
had
he
remained
at
the
hotel
seen
the
real
norman
return
and
perceived
the
whole
imposition
a
light
knock
sounded
on
his
door
merriam
jumped
and
then
lay
still
can
i
come
in
it
was
jennie
s
voice
yes
he
said
embarrassed
but
what
other
reply
could
be
made
jennie
opened
the
door
and
came
to
his
bedside
she
had
changed
her
attire
completely
she
now
wore
the
costume
of
a
a
tight
pink
corsage
very
low
and
sleeveless
with
the
slightest
of
pink
loops
over
her
shoulders
a
short
fluffy
pink
skirt
barely
to
her
knees
pink
tights
and
pink
dancing
slippers
over
one
of
the
bright
knobs
of
her
hair
was
a
pink
rose
she
was
much
more
brilliantly
rouged
than
before
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
warm
scent
of
powder
and
perfume
merriam
lay
staring
at
her
without
speaking
subconsciously
shocked
perhaps
but
openly
bewildered
and
fascinated
she
smiled
at
him
and
seemed
to
be
inspecting
him
in
return
her
left
hand
hung
at
her
side
holding
something
heavy
but
she
put
out
her
right
and
touched
his
hair
with
a
single
little
movement
ruffled
it
you
look
very
nice
lying
there
she
said
in
the
most
natural
tones
in
the
world
how
do
i
look
she
stepped
back
and
pirouetted
turning
completely
around
on
her
toes
the
fluffy
pink
skirts
swung
out
and
circled
with
her
in
a
most
entrancing
manner
merriam
was
quite
dazzled
the
white
gleam
of
her
back
as
she
turned
the
slender
white
arms
held
gracefully
away
from
her
sides
in
spite
of
that
heavy
something
in
one
hand
the
tight
slimness
of
the
waist
the
glimpse
of
pink
legs
beneath
the
circling
skirt
he
had
seen
the
like
only
on
the
stage
it
was
rather
overpowering
so
close
at
hand
but
in
a
single
rosy
moment
her
revolution
was
completed
she
was
facing
him
again
and
relaxing
down
off
her
toes
how
do
i
look
she
repeated
smiling
with
the
slightest
natural
augmentation
of
her
artificial
flush
merriam
swallowed
stunning
he
ejaculated
she
beamed
of
course
i
do
she
said
then
her
face
seemed
to
harden
she
stepped
closer
to
the
bed
so
that
she
was
almost
bending
over
him
i
ve
got
a
part
to
play
she
said
well
i
m
going
to
play
it
there
was
a
touch
of
something
like
defiance
in
her
voice
now
i
ve
cooked
up
a
plot
for
mister
thompson
marge
don
t
like
it
but
she
ll
help
i
ll
show
him
you
ve
got
to
help
too
she
raised
her
left
hand
displaying
the
heavy
object
held
therein
which
he
had
not
yet
identified
he
was
somewhat
startled
to
see
that
it
was
a
small
revolver
take
it
she
said
as
he
did
not
instantly
put
out
his
arm
she
tossed
it
across
so
that
it
fell
on
the
bed
on
the
other
side
of
him
it
s
loaded
she
said
with
blanks
mister
thompson
shall
see
you
first
but
afterwards
marge
and
i
will
see
what
we
can
do
with
him
we
ll
get
him
to
stay
for
a
little
supper
and
i
m
going
to
play
up
to
him
i
ll
do
a
dance
on
the
table
but
when
he
tries
to
catch
me
i
ll
scream
that
s
where
you
come
in
you
rush
out
with
your
revolver
and
drive
him
out
of
the
house
won
t
it
be
fun
she
demanded
glowing
with
excitement
we
ll
have
the
goods
on
him
he
ll
keep
his
face
shut
after
that
whatever
he
knows
or
thinks
about
george
we
ll
have
a
fine
story
for
thompson
if
he
don
t
oh
a
doorbell
had
rung
loudly
in
the
kitchenette
there
he
is
now
remember
when
i
scream
she
was
gone
from
the
bedroom
closing
the
door
behind
her
merriam
lay
as
if
dazed
this
high
life
was
proving
almost
too
fast
for
his
bucolic
and
pedagogical
wits
he
jumped
when
the
bell
rang
again
more
violently
then
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
hall
door
being
opened
and
a
loud
masculine
voice
was
it
thompson
s
a
moment
or
two
later
the
voice
became
more
distinct
and
he
could
hear
the
girls
voices
too
he
could
not
be
sure
it
was
thompson
was
it
some
one
of
his
henchmen
instead
whoever
he
was
he
was
in
the
sitting
room
in
a
moment
or
two
he
would
almost
certainly
be
coming
out
to
the
bedroom
merriam
suddenly
remembered
the
revolver
and
reached
for
it
and
slipped
it
under
the
bedclothes
he
had
several
minutes
more
to
wait
the
voices
became
lower
then
they
were
raised
again
suddenly
he
heard
the
rings
of
the
portières
clash
the
curtains
had
been
sharply
flung
aside
margery
s
thin
voice
came
to
him
see
for
yourself
then
it
said
that
s
better
said
the
masculine
voice
in
tones
half
amused
half
irritated
was
it
thompson
light
footsteps
and
heavy
footsteps
crossed
the
dining
room
together
the
bedroom
door
was
opened
sir
said
margery
to
merriam
in
tones
a
little
shrill
with
excitement
this
is
a
crockett
he
has
some
crazy
notion
about
your
being
senator
norman
see
for
yourself
crockett
she
spoke
his
name
as
though
it
were
an
insult
remember
he
s
sick
she
added
warningly
margery
was
not
a
bad
actress
crockett
crockett
himself
so
much
the
better
with
an
effort
merriam
steadied
his
nerves
crockett
advanced
to
the
bedside
a
tall
imposing
gentleman
in
evening
clothes
with
keen
blue
eyes
and
a
thin
remnant
of
lightish
hair
well
george
he
said
blandly
glad
to
see
you
your
little
friends
are
very
loyal
but
they
couldn
t
keep
me
away
from
you
merriam
instantly
disliked
crockett
he
plunged
with
zest
into
his
part
george
he
inquired
coldly
my
name
s
not
george
oh
come
come
norman
you
re
caught
fess
up
but
he
looked
closer
at
the
same
moment
margery
lifted
a
silk
shade
off
the
electric
bulb
by
the
bureau
and
the
cold
hard
light
fell
full
on
the
younger
man
s
face
who
do
you
think
i
am
said
merriam
and
who
are
you
he
added
in
an
insolent
tone
the
impressive
financier
stared
he
bent
down
and
stared
harder
well
merriam
demanded
with
all
the
hauteur
he
could
muster
and
then
got
an
he
had
preconceived
this
colloquy
in
much
more
dignified
phrases
but
the
insulting
tag
of
boyish
slang
popped
out
of
him
unawares
however
he
could
not
have
done
better
probably
he
could
never
by
taking
thought
have
done
as
well
senator
norman
would
assuredly
not
have
used
that
expression
it
had
been
coined
long
since
his
day
in
boyville
crockett
was
convinced
but
he
was
a
gentleman
of
considerable
imperturbability
he
merely
straightened
up
and
asked
who
are
you
the
younger
man
suddenly
decided
not
to
give
his
name
there
was
that
in
crockett
s
blue
eyes
that
suggested
an
uncomfortable
pertinacity
and
ruthlessness
in
following
up
any
clue
he
might
get
hold
of
what
business
is
that
of
yours
said
merriam
crockett
blinked
he
was
doubtless
unaccustomed
to
such
replies
but
he
merely
asked
another
question
where
are
you
from
down
state
said
merriam
that
was
both
insolent
and
safe
illinois
is
tolerably
sizable
how
old
are
you
merriam
saw
an
advantage
in
answering
this
query
truthfully
he
said
what
of
it
you
don
t
happen
to
be
a
young
nephew
or
cousin
of
senator
norman
s
do
you
asked
crockett
hitting
the
bull
with
his
first
arrow
merriam
somewhat
startled
countered
with
a
flat
denial
no
i
m
not
i
ve
been
told
i
look
like
him
he
added
somebody
took
me
for
him
last
night
but
i
m
only
related
to
him
through
adam
and
eve
so
far
as
i
know
crockett
scanned
him
narrowly
somebody
took
you
for
norman
last
night
they
sure
did
having
struck
the
slangy
note
by
accident
merriam
was
enough
of
an
actor
to
keep
it
up
i
should
be
much
obliged
if
you
will
tell
me
about
that
merriam
s
returned
he
had
been
realising
how
little
this
dialogue
was
developing
in
accordance
with
his
pleasing
anticipations
instead
of
the
rôle
of
a
polished
man
of
the
world
delivering
brilliant
thrusts
of
irony
and
reducing
his
interlocutor
to
apologetic
confusion
he
had
stumbled
inadvertently
on
that
of
a
slangy
youth
submitting
to
be
catechised
by
an
individual
who
remained
singularly
composed
and
had
proved
dangerously
shrewd
but
at
last
he
had
led
up
adroitly
enough
to
the
story
which
rockwell
had
charged
him
to
tell
he
set
himself
to
tell
it
in
character
well
if
you
want
to
know
i
came
up
to
the
city
on
business
yesterday
when
i
got
my
work
done
i
thought
i
d
have
a
little
fun
see
the
sights
you
know
i
don
t
know
this
town
much
but
i
got
hold
of
a
taxi
man
who
took
me
around
i
looked
in
at
several
places
i
guess
i
had
a
pretty
good
time
i
don
t
remember
much
i
had
more
highballs
than
i
m
used
to
we
ended
up
at
a
dance
hall
somewhere
there
were
some
pretty
girls
there
somebody
said
you
re
senator
norman
aren
t
you
that
struck
me
as
funny
sure
i
am
i
said
and
i
kept
it
up
soon
everybody
in
the
place
was
calling
me
i
treated
the
gang
then
i
got
into
a
fight
i
don
t
remember
how
somebody
knocked
me
down
i
think
but
i
wasn
t
hurt
any
after
that
i
picked
up
this
little
girl
that
lives
here
the
one
in
pink
and
she
brought
me
home
with
her
i
had
a
bad
head
on
this
morning
and
a
bad
cold
besides
the
little
girl
is
a
good
sport
she
let
me
stay
here
all
day
i
m
going
down
home
in
the
morning
i
see
said
crockett
slowly
merriam
had
need
of
all
his
to
conceal
his
elation
as
he
perceived
that
his
formidable
antagonist
had
swallowed
bait
hook
and
sinker
as
the
idiom
goes
he
was
obviously
piecing
merriam
s
narrative
together
in
his
mind
with
the
story
about
norman
margery
who
had
remained
standing
unobtrusive
and
silent
by
the
bureau
flashed
merriam
a
commendatory
glance
stimulated
thereby
he
pertly
followed
up
his
advantage
care
for
any
more
of
my
personal
memoirs
no
thank
you
said
crockett
with
a
rather
sour
smile
good
night
he
was
angling
for
the
name
again
but
with
a
feebleness
unworthy
of
a
great
financier
blank
said
merriam
i
ve
a
bit
of
a
reputation
to
keep
up
in
my
own
home
town
i
see
said
crockett
again
well
i
m
sorry
to
have
intruded
take
care
of
your
reputation
he
turned
away
towards
the
door
in
that
open
door
jennie
had
stood
listening
now
her
cue
had
come
she
took
it
promptly
she
advanced
into
the
bedroom
stepping
lightly
on
her
toes
her
pink
skirt
waving
prettily
she
smiled
her
brightest
smile
at
crockett
he
isn
t
senator
norman
is
he
she
cried
gaily
he
certainly
isn
t
said
crockett
looking
at
her
no
man
could
have
helped
looking
at
her
you
were
awfully
rude
about
it
said
jennie
pouting
she
had
stopped
about
two
feet
in
front
of
him
was
i
i
should
say
you
were
awfully
you
ought
to
do
something
to
make
up
for
it
what
ought
i
to
do
asked
crockett
you
might
stay
for
a
little
supper
with
margery
and
me
might
i
unexpectedly
crockett
looked
away
from
jennie
he
looked
at
merriam
thoughtfully
a
disconcerting
thoughtfulness
then
he
turned
back
to
jennie
perhaps
i
might
he
said
with
a
faint
smile
merriam
read
his
mind
he
was
sure
he
did
the
man
might
or
might
not
be
slightly
attracted
by
jennie
s
prettiness
but
what
he
was
thinking
was
that
he
would
be
able
to
get
more
out
of
her
than
he
had
been
able
to
get
from
merriam
the
latter
at
once
perceived
that
jennie
s
melodramatic
scheme
was
dangerous
and
silly
it
might
have
been
all
right
with
thompson
but
not
with
this
man
she
hadn
t
sense
enough
to
see
the
difference
but
he
could
do
nothing
to
stop
her
already
she
had
cried
oh
goody
like
a
little
girl
she
stepped
past
crockett
brushing
him
with
her
skirts
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
began
playfully
to
push
him
towards
the
dining
room
it
s
all
ready
she
was
saying
we
got
it
for
the
man
inside
but
he
says
he
isn
t
hungry
we
have
sandwiches
and
olives
and
cheese
and
beer
and
there
s
whiskey
if
you
like
i
ll
take
beer
said
crockett
mustering
a
certain
lightness
and
allowing
himself
to
be
pushed
merriam
looked
at
margery
still
standing
by
the
bureau
she
too
had
changed
her
costume
she
now
wore
an
evening
dress
of
black
and
gold
in
which
she
looked
very
well
rather
brilliant
in
fact
but
what
merriam
noticed
was
the
understanding
look
in
her
eyes
she
had
read
crockett
s
purpose
as
clearly
as
he
had
we
ll
be
careful
she
said
you
did
fine
shall
i
turn
out
the
light
no
said
merriam
leave
it
please
she
walked
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
eventful
supper
though
margery
had
closed
the
door
merriam
could
hear
practically
everything
that
went
on
in
the
adjoining
room
as
one
commonly
can
in
an
apartment
get
the
food
from
the
ice
chest
will
you
marge
cried
jennie
in
tones
whose
gaiety
sounded
genuine
i
ll
set
out
the
drinks
let
s
have
a
cocktail
to
start
with
she
interrupted
herself
what
s
your
first
name
well
said
crockett
one
of
my
first
names
is
henry
then
i
ll
call
you
i
hate
last
names
and
mister
and
miss
merriam
in
his
recumbent
solitude
made
a
cynically
humorous
grimace
she
had
used
those
very
words
with
him
had
begun
the
same
way
her
regular
formula
doubtless
i
m
jennie
you
know
she
continued
now
what
kind
of
cocktail
i
ll
stick
to
beer
please
but
i
want
to
start
with
a
cocktail
have
one
with
me
please
the
tone
was
that
of
a
teasing
child
in
his
mind
s
eye
merriam
could
see
vividly
the
trim
pink
figure
as
it
had
pirouetted
before
him
and
the
pretty
pouting
face
but
crockett
was
apparently
unmoved
bye
and
bye
he
said
suavely
go
ahead
with
your
cocktail
we
don
t
all
have
to
drink
the
same
things
do
we
i
ll
start
with
beer
and
work
up
to
cocktails
well
then
said
jennie
with
a
swift
return
to
unpetulant
gaiety
marge
is
bringing
your
old
beer
oh
goody
see
cheese
sandwiches
and
chicken
sandwiches
and
sandwiches
evidently
margery
had
returned
well
laden
from
the
ice
chest
which
kind
will
you
have
harry
cheese
thank
you
said
harry
there
with
my
own
fingers
jennie
spoke
with
some
confidence
that
the
touch
of
her
fingers
would
render
bread
and
cheese
ambrosial
thank
you
said
harry
again
with
the
barest
nuance
of
dryness
in
his
tone
i
ll
open
the
beer
what
will
you
drink
miss
milton
undoubtedly
he
was
snubbing
jennie
those
blue
eyes
of
his
might
perhaps
be
attentive
enough
to
white
arms
and
tight
waists
and
pink
legs
when
he
himself
had
sought
them
out
but
they
were
not
to
be
distracted
by
any
such
frivolous
phenomena
when
serious
business
was
afoot
jennie
would
fail
merriam
was
sure
of
it
but
at
any
rate
she
was
not
easily
snubbed
her
name
s
margery
she
cried
consistent
in
her
antipathy
to
surnames
well
margery
said
crockett
complaisantly
beer
said
margery
it
was
the
first
word
merriam
had
heard
her
speak
her
taciturnity
comforted
him
jennie
was
a
little
fool
but
margery
would
keep
her
head
they
would
waste
their
time
and
their
sandwiches
and
beer
on
crockett
but
perhaps
she
would
foil
any
inquiries
he
might
presently
attempt
don
t
set
things
in
the
middle
of
the
table
marge
cried
jennie
set
em
around
the
edge
i
m
going
to
do
a
dance
for
you
harry
wouldn
t
you
like
to
see
me
dancing
on
the
table
it
would
be
very
charming
said
harry
but
the
tone
was
merely
gallant
it
betokened
no
quickening
of
pulse
i
must
have
a
sandwich
first
though
said
jennie
quickly
even
she
perceived
that
she
was
not
making
progress
there
followed
eating
and
drinking
accompanied
by
a
patter
of
gay
disconnected
sallies
from
jennie
relating
chiefly
to
the
eatables
and
drinkables
harry
continually
appealed
to
by
that
name
remained
calmly
polite
margery
when
addressed
responded
in
monosyllables
ripe
olives
and
cold
tongue
and
mustard
were
produced
jennie
had
her
cocktail
and
then
another
she
needed
stimulant
poor
girl
to
keep
up
the
gay
vivacity
which
was
meeting
with
so
little
encouragement
a
second
bottle
of
beer
was
opened
for
harry
and
margery
meanwhile
merriam
still
listening
was
engaged
also
in
active
cogitation
he
saw
well
enough
into
crockett
s
thought
the
latter
had
been
momentarily
convinced
by
his
merriam
s
tale
margery
had
said
he
had
done
fine
but
the
keen
realistic
mind
behind
those
blue
eyes
had
almost
immediately
rebounded
and
seized
upon
the
overwhelming
inherent
improbability
of
that
yarn
that
there
should
be
a
man
without
close
relationship
to
norman
who
resembled
him
so
strongly
was
in
itself
decidedly
remarkable
that
this
man
should
encounter
norman
s
mistress
by
pure
chance
at
a
public
dance
and
go
home
with
her
was
even
more
curious
and
that
all
this
should
happen
merely
fortuitously
on
the
very
night
on
which
senator
norman
had
unaccountably
broken
before
nine
o
clock
solemn
promises
given
with
every
appearance
of
sincerity
and
willingness
shortly
before
eight
and
suddenly
gone
over
to
a
party
for
which
throughout
a
score
of
years
he
had
expressed
nothing
but
dislike
and
contempt
the
mathematical
chances
against
such
a
series
of
coincidences
were
simply
incalculable
it
was
a
quick
clear
perception
of
this
abstract
apriori
incredibility
that
merriam
had
read
in
crockett
s
final
glance
before
jennie
playfully
pushed
him
out
of
the
bedroom
doubtless
he
was
still
revolving
it
in
his
mind
as
he
sat
at
jennie
s
table
responding
with
merely
mechanical
politeness
to
her
rather
pitiful
attempts
to
pique
his
interest
and
desire
well
let
him
revolve
it
the
story
all
hung
together
what
could
he
make
of
it
little
enough
probably
with
the
data
he
had
now
but
that
was
why
he
was
lingering
here
at
jennie
s
in
the
hope
of
getting
more
data
after
another
cocktail
or
two
jennie
would
not
know
what
she
was
saying
then
he
would
begin
to
hint
to
ask
questions
could
margery
keep
her
quiet
a
single
word
might
give
him
a
clue
merriam
became
conscious
of
a
wish
that
rockwell
were
at
hand
to
help
but
that
wish
instantly
gave
birth
to
further
fears
rockwell
had
said
he
would
telephone
from
the
hotel
as
soon
as
they
arrived
that
message
might
come
any
minute
now
with
crockett
there
whereabouts
in
the
flat
was
the
telephone
he
had
not
noticed
it
anywhere
he
looked
about
the
bedroom
but
it
was
not
there
of
course
ought
not
that
message
to
have
come
already
surely
they
should
be
at
the
hotel
by
now
unless
something
had
gone
wrong
he
suddenly
envisaged
all
the
perils
of
discovery
which
he
had
hitherto
been
too
much
occupied
to
realise
involved
in
the
transportation
of
the
sick
senator
across
the
roof
down
through
the
other
trapdoor
into
the
other
hall
down
three
flights
of
stairs
along
two
blocks
of
city
street
to
the
taxi
they
might
so
easily
have
been
noted
by
some
of
thompson
s
or
crockett
s
watchers
and
followed
to
the
hotel
then
they
would
be
caught
indeed
in
the
very
fact
verily
the
paths
of
the
impostor
are
perilous
then
merriam
s
mind
was
brought
sharply
back
from
these
alarming
excursions
to
his
own
scarcely
less
dangerous
situation
crockett
had
for
the
first
time
volunteered
a
remark
it
was
just
such
a
remark
as
merriam
had
anticipated
nice
boy
you
have
in
there
his
voice
was
slightly
lowered
but
only
slightly
perhaps
he
did
not
realise
the
perfection
of
the
acoustic
properties
of
flats
very
nice
boy
agreed
jennie
cordially
merriam
noticed
with
alarm
just
the
faintest
touch
of
the
effect
of
cocktails
in
her
accent
how
many
had
the
girl
had
by
now
so
you
met
him
at
reiberg
s
did
you
crockett
pursued
reiberg
s
said
jennie
doubtfully
reiberg
s
yes
margery
cut
in
picked
him
up
there
and
brought
him
home
i
call
it
a
shame
jen
s
never
done
that
sort
of
thing
before
i
expect
you
took
to
him
because
he
looks
so
much
like
senator
norman
suggested
crockett
rather
skillfully
persistent
yes
said
jennie
looks
very
like
george
but
he
s
george
he
s
john
john
what
asked
crockett
mildly
john
blank
said
margery
sharply
he
told
you
he
didn
t
want
to
give
his
name
jen
keep
your
face
shut
i
beg
your
pardon
i
m
sure
said
crockett
have
a
cocktail
now
said
jennie
quite
unabashed
crockett
at
last
agreed
to
a
cocktail
and
it
was
fixed
for
him
and
the
conversation
if
such
it
could
be
called
again
concerned
itself
with
incidents
to
the
consumption
of
food
and
drink
thank
god
for
margery
she
had
won
the
first
trick
but
crockett
would
try
again
and
jennie
would
grow
more
and
more
difficult
to
handle
aside
from
the
danger
merriam
hated
to
think
of
jennie
s
getting
really
drunk
could
not
margery
get
rid
of
the
man
the
trouble
was
he
had
stayed
at
jennie
s
invitation
could
not
he
merriam
do
something
he
felt
under
the
bedclothes
until
he
found
the
revolver
he
drew
it
out
and
looked
at
it
but
of
what
use
was
it
really
would
crockett
blench
at
the
mere
pointing
of
a
pistol
he
doubted
it
it
was
loaded
only
with
blanks
jennie
had
said
and
he
dared
not
fire
it
anyway
the
occupants
of
a
dozen
adjoining
flats
would
hear
the
report
people
would
come
bursting
in
the
police
would
be
called
well
was
not
that
the
solution
to
have
crockett
caught
in
that
flat
by
the
police
in
connection
with
a
shooting
perhaps
but
not
a
nice
one
for
himself
not
to
be
tried
except
as
the
very
last
resort
besides
would
it
serve
their
purpose
a
public
exposure
of
crockett
would
do
no
good
what
they
needed
was
a
threat
of
possible
exposure
to
hold
over
him
not
the
exposure
itself
if
only
jennie
could
succeed
in
her
purpose
of
enticing
him
into
some
display
of
amorousness
of
which
he
and
margery
might
be
witnesses
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
the
goods
on
him
to
use
jennie
s
phrase
why
did
she
not
dance
for
him
but
crockett
would
not
be
enticed
he
might
however
pretend
to
be
he
might
decide
to
play
up
in
that
way
if
through
margery
s
watchfulness
he
could
get
nothing
out
of
jennie
without
doing
so
but
now
there
flashed
into
merriam
s
mind
a
doubt
of
the
efficacy
of
jennie
s
scheme
even
if
they
should
succeed
in
carrying
it
out
suppose
crockett
should
catch
hold
of
her
after
her
dance
and
try
to
kiss
her
and
she
should
scream
and
he
should
rush
out
with
his
revolver
and
crockett
should
be
intimidated
thereby
into
ignominious
exit
that
would
be
very
good
fun
but
would
it
give
them
any
hold
over
him
in
case
of
need
he
could
deny
it
against
his
word
the
only
witnesses
would
be
jennie
and
margery
whose
testimony
would
not
be
taken
very
seriously
and
himself
a
nobody
and
an
impostor
no
wonder
margery
the
had
disapproved
they
ought
to
get
more
tangible
evidence
something
in
writing
or
a
photograph
he
suddenly
remembered
the
camera
on
the
table
in
the
living
room
and
recalled
also
a
certain
college
episode
a
rather
lurid
incident
of
his
fraternity
days
in
which
a
camera
and
a
girl
and
a
priggish
freshman
had
figured
it
suggested
to
him
a
decidedly
picturesque
and
venturesome
procedure
against
crockett
but
he
shook
his
head
it
was
too
violent
too
rough
all
very
well
for
a
parcel
of
boys
with
a
freshman
but
with
crockett
the
mighty
capitalist
no
hardly
just
then
he
heard
jennie
say
get
your
mandolin
marge
i
m
going
to
dance
now
fine
said
crockett
but
he
was
still
cool
amused
margery
made
no
reply
but
she
evidently
complied
in
a
moment
there
came
a
preliminary
strumming
on
the
mandolin
help
me
up
harry
said
jennie
with
pleasure
said
harry
he
was
helping
her
to
mount
on
to
the
table
move
that
siphon
off
jennie
said
i
might
kick
it
over
there
was
gay
excitement
in
her
voice
cocktails
had
made
her
indifferent
to
appreciation
as
for
merriam
the
conscience
of
a
realist
compels
me
to
report
a
sense
of
disappointment
he
wanted
to
see
the
dance
now
sit
down
again
cried
jennie
you
can
see
better
at
this
frankness
crockett
laughed
there
was
the
sound
of
his
dropping
into
a
chair
now
marge
jennie
commanded
but
margery
did
not
strike
into
her
tune
and
the
dance
did
not
begin
for
at
that
instant
the
telephone
rang
it
was
in
the
dining
room
then
there
was
a
quick
movement
of
chairs
and
feet
then
crockett
s
voice
said
hello
he
was
answering
it
that
s
not
fair
cried
margery
it
s
not
for
you
keep
off
said
crockett
in
a
quick
stern
whisper
and
then
evidently
into
the
telephone
yes
yes
merriam
leapt
out
of
bed
revolver
in
hand
in
his
pajamas
and
flung
open
the
door
crockett
was
standing
by
the
wall
at
the
telephone
jennie
in
her
ballet
costume
stood
transfixed
in
the
center
of
the
table
margery
was
rushing
at
crockett
you
you
spy
she
screamed
merriam
in
the
door
pointed
his
revolver
drop
it
he
cried
meaning
the
telephone
receiver
hands
up
but
crockett
catching
margery
by
the
shoulder
with
his
free
hand
held
her
powerfully
at
arm
s
length
and
only
smiled
at
merriam
s
revolver
why
he
asked
into
the
telephone
and
added
quickly
nothing
these
girls
are
romping
so
but
his
words
could
hardly
be
heard
for
margery
s
screaming
he
dropped
the
receiver
and
put
the
hand
thus
freed
over
the
mouthpiece
shut
up
he
said
fiercely
to
margery
and
gave
her
shoulder
a
violent
wrench
o
oh
she
groaned
something
had
to
be
done
instantly
for
crockett
was
turning
back
to
the
telephone
with
a
sort
of
impulsive
desperation
merriam
threw
the
revolver
at
crockett
s
head
the
man
dodged
and
the
revolver
struck
the
opposite
wall
and
fell
to
the
floor
but
the
movement
took
him
away
from
the
telephone
and
merriam
rushing
forward
added
the
impetus
of
a
thrust
which
sent
him
staggering
against
the
table
then
merriam
caught
up
the
receiver
hello
hello
he
cried
into
the
mouthpiece
for
an
instant
no
reply
then
central
s
voice
said
sweetly
your
party
s
hung
up
and
added
in
tones
of
unwonted
interest
what
s
the
row
there
shall
i
send
the
police
no
no
said
merriam
there
s
nothing
wrong
here
he
hung
up
and
turned
to
face
the
room
crockett
was
still
leaning
against
the
table
margery
was
clutching
the
arm
which
a
moment
before
had
gripped
her
and
jennie
had
jumped
down
from
the
table
and
caught
hold
of
his
other
arm
but
the
financier
appeared
very
little
ruffled
he
even
smiled
at
merriam
not
unpleasantly
well
merriam
he
said
suppose
we
sit
down
and
talk
it
over
if
these
ladies
will
release
me
that
is
mr
merriam
then
the
message
been
from
rockwell
and
crockett
had
got
the
name
after
all
how
much
more
had
he
learned
merriam
was
quite
willing
to
talk
in
the
hope
of
finding
that
out
very
well
he
said
let
him
go
margery
jennie
i
ll
dance
for
both
of
you
cried
jennie
whose
cheeks
were
decidedly
flushed
no
said
merriam
sit
down
please
sit
down
jen
seconded
margery
viciously
oh
well
jennie
plopped
petulantly
into
a
chair
the
others
sat
merriam
and
crockett
across
from
each
other
the
financier
looked
steadily
at
the
younger
man
miss
milton
was
right
he
began
quietly
the
message
was
not
for
me
it
was
for
you
merriam
i
think
i
ought
to
give
it
to
you
if
you
please
said
merriam
it
was
that
you
should
come
at
once
to
the
merriam
managed
not
to
blink
what
hotel
he
asked
for
an
instant
crockett
weighed
his
answer
then
the
de
soto
he
said
but
merriam
had
read
the
meaning
of
the
momentary
pause
rockwell
had
not
named
the
hotel
he
wouldn
t
of
course
crockett
was
guessing
de
soto
he
asked
looking
as
puzzled
as
he
could
i
thought
it
might
be
from
the
nestor
house
he
was
using
the
first
name
that
popped
into
his
head
oh
said
crockett
lightly
rockwell
would
be
much
more
likely
to
telephone
from
the
de
soto
merriam
was
startled
but
he
could
only
go
on
as
he
had
begun
rockwell
he
echoed
as
if
still
further
mystified
come
come
said
crockett
i
recognised
his
voice
i
know
it
perfectly
no
friend
of
mine
merriam
persisted
there
might
be
no
advantage
in
continued
denial
but
certainly
there
could
be
none
in
admission
really
merriam
hadn
t
you
better
tell
me
the
whole
story
you
ll
not
find
me
ungenerous
i
ll
let
you
down
easy
the
whole
story
said
merriam
thought
i
told
you
my
whole
story
in
the
bedroom
a
while
back
what
more
do
you
want
crockett
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
smiled
blandly
what
i
want
is
another
cocktail
i
guess
you
ll
join
me
merriam
you
ve
had
nothing
all
evening
it
must
have
been
dull
for
you
lying
in
there
while
these
pretty
ladies
have
been
entertaining
me
so
charmingly
i
understood
you
were
sick
you
know
he
added
slyly
or
i
should
have
insisted
on
your
coming
out
long
ago
then
quickly
so
as
to
give
merriam
no
chance
to
reply
jennie
my
dear
let
s
have
your
pretty
dance
now
we
were
interrupted
no
said
jennie
rather
sleepily
i
m
tired
have
a
cocktail
said
crockett
promptly
then
you
ll
be
all
right
again
jennie
looked
up
with
interest
well
she
said
crockett
rose
to
mix
the
drinks
you
ll
have
one
too
mr
merriam
but
during
the
brief
interchange
between
crockett
and
jennie
merriam
had
been
doing
some
quick
thinking
wild
thinking
perhaps
the
plan
suggested
by
his
college
memory
which
before
he
had
rejected
as
too
violent
his
mind
now
seized
upon
and
was
eagerly
shaping
to
the
present
situation
when
crockett
addressed
him
he
rose
no
he
said
i
m
tired
too
i
sick
he
simulated
a
slight
dizziness
i
ll
go
lie
down
again
if
you
ll
excuse
me
he
moved
to
the
bedroom
door
affecting
uncertainty
in
his
steps
as
he
passed
into
the
bedroom
he
called
margery
in
a
moment
margery
had
followed
him
shut
the
door
he
barely
formed
the
words
with
his
lips
she
obeyed
that
camera
in
the
sitting
room
he
whispered
can
you
take
a
flash
light
with
it
sure
came
the
whispered
answer
that
s
what
we
use
it
for
have
you
any
rope
rope
echoed
margery
s
whisper
there
s
a
clothesline
on
the
back
porch
bring
it
to
me
margery
looked
at
him
but
a
high
degree
of
mutual
confidence
had
been
established
between
these
two
she
nodded
right
away
yes
mustn
t
see
it
no
she
opened
the
door
and
closed
it
behind
her
merriam
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
thinking
hard
he
wants
a
drink
of
water
he
heard
her
say
to
the
others
in
the
dining
room
with
one
ear
so
to
speak
that
is
to
say
with
so
much
of
his
mind
as
could
attend
to
one
ear
he
listened
to
crockett
and
jennie
engaged
still
in
the
business
of
mixing
drinks
with
the
rest
of
his
mind
he
was
making
plans
with
a
rapidity
and
confident
daring
that
astonished
himself
in
a
moment
margery
had
returned
in
her
right
hand
she
carried
a
glass
of
water
her
left
hand
hanging
at
her
side
seemed
to
hold
carelessly
only
a
newspaper
folded
in
two
but
as
soon
as
she
had
closed
the
door
she
produced
from
between
the
folds
a
fairly
stout
clothesline
loosely
coiled
merriam
tried
its
toughness
and
surveyed
its
length
all
right
he
whispered
now
go
back
drink
with
them
jennie
must
dance
and
have
crockett
sit
where
he
was
before
this
was
at
the
end
of
the
table
nearest
the
telephone
and
nearest
also
to
merriam
s
door
again
margery
looked
at
him
she
glanced
at
the
rope
but
she
asked
no
questions
without
a
word
she
went
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
admirable
girl
merriam
s
next
actions
were
rather
remarkable
he
felt
hastily
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
which
lay
over
a
chair
and
produced
a
penknife
with
this
instrument
he
cut
off
four
pieces
of
rope
each
about
four
feet
long
this
left
about
ten
feet
in
the
main
piece
with
this
main
piece
he
proceeded
to
manufacture
a
slip
noose
carefully
testing
both
the
strength
of
the
slipknot
and
the
readiness
of
its
slipping
then
he
gathered
the
noose
and
the
four
other
pieces
of
rope
into
his
left
hand
and
rose
and
stood
before
the
door
drawing
a
deep
breath
and
listening
he
had
of
course
kept
track
more
or
less
of
the
happenings
in
the
other
room
margery
on
returning
had
demanded
another
glass
of
beer
and
had
yielded
to
insistence
that
she
have
a
cocktail
instead
then
she
had
suggested
that
jennie
dance
jennie
had
already
been
assisted
on
to
the
table
again
and
margery
was
picking
tentatively
at
her
mandolin
cried
jennie
a
little
unsteadily
merriam
stepped
back
and
turned
the
button
of
his
electric
bulb
so
as
to
have
no
light
behind
him
then
as
margery
struck
into
a
bright
quick
tune
he
softly
opened
the
door
with
his
right
hand
holding
his
left
hand
with
the
ropes
behind
him
and
stood
looking
at
jennie
whose
pink
toes
had
begun
to
patter
merrily
on
the
polished
table
jennie
saw
him
and
laughed
to
him
her
eyes
and
her
cheeks
bright
come
in
johnny
she
cried
and
for
a
second
one
pink
leg
pointed
straight
at
him
as
she
turned
couldn
t
resist
eh
chuckled
crockett
who
was
leaning
back
in
the
heavy
chair
merriam
had
wished
him
to
occupy
he
was
apparently
really
pleased
for
the
first
time
don
t
blame
you
he
added
come
on
in
his
eyes
quite
unsuspicious
returned
to
the
circling
skirts
and
the
flushed
face
bobbing
above
them
this
was
merriam
s
moment
he
stepped
quickly
behind
crockett
s
chair
dropped
the
short
pieces
of
rope
on
the
floor
raised
the
noose
with
both
hands
slipped
it
over
the
man
s
head
and
pulled
it
suddenly
tight
about
his
neck
crockett
emitted
a
strangled
oath
and
started
to
rise
but
merriam
with
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
thrust
him
down
again
and
with
the
other
tightened
the
noose
about
his
throat
sit
still
he
threatened
or
i
ll
choke
you
margery
s
tune
had
stopped
abruptly
and
jennie
stood
still
on
the
table
staring
down
in
frightened
bewilderment
margery
merriam
commanded
take
one
of
these
pieces
of
rope
and
tie
his
arm
to
the
arm
of
the
chair
the
arm
referred
to
was
immediately
raised
away
from
the
chair
but
the
noose
tightened
with
a
further
jerk
and
the
arm
fell
limply
back
in
fact
crockett
was
gasping
and
choking
so
desperately
that
merriam
was
compelled
to
loosen
the
rope
a
little
take
it
quietly
he
cautioned
with
perhaps
a
trifle
more
of
youthful
ferocity
and
exultation
than
the
romantic
hero
should
exhibit
or
i
ll
hang
you
sitting
down
margery
obedient
as
usual
had
stepped
quickly
forward
picked
up
a
piece
of
rope
and
begun
to
bind
the
arm
nearest
her
to
the
chair
crockett
somewhat
eased
though
still
gasping
a
little
turned
his
head
to
look
at
merriam
his
first
involuntary
startled
alarm
was
passing
the
blue
eyes
looked
steadily
at
the
young
man
a
trace
of
their
earlier
cool
amusement
returned
he
looked
away
again
and
sat
perfectly
still
acquiescent
merriam
however
remained
warily
at
his
post
in
charge
of
the
slip
noose
while
margery
tied
both
arms
now
tie
his
feet
to
the
legs
of
the
chair
said
merriam
jennie
you
can
help
jump
down
and
tie
his
right
foot
while
margery
ties
the
left
but
jennie
still
on
the
table
shook
her
pretty
head
i
d
rather
dance
she
said
and
regardless
of
the
lack
of
music
she
folded
her
arms
and
began
to
do
the
steps
of
the
highland
fling
let
her
alone
said
margery
who
had
gone
down
on
her
knees
and
was
at
work
on
the
left
foot
jennie
tossed
her
head
and
quickened
the
tempo
of
her
dance
keeping
her
eyes
on
crockett
who
though
still
swallowing
with
difficulty
affected
to
regard
her
with
interest
margery
crossed
to
crockett
s
other
side
and
knelt
again
in
a
moment
she
completed
her
labours
and
rose
her
cheeks
a
little
reddened
by
her
posture
and
vigorous
work
there
she
said
looking
straight
at
merriam
as
if
she
were
a
soldier
reporting
to
his
officer
thank
you
very
much
said
the
young
man
he
loosened
the
noose
leaving
it
still
in
place
however
about
crockett
s
neck
then
he
stepped
to
the
side
of
the
table
and
held
out
his
arms
to
jennie
come
he
said
i
ll
lift
you
down
she
stood
still
you
don
t
like
my
dancing
she
pouted
likes
it
she
pointed
at
crockett
who
twisting
his
eased
neck
about
smiled
i
ll
like
lifting
you
down
said
merriam
jennie
smiled
and
approached
the
edge
of
the
table
for
a
moment
he
held
a
rosy
fragrant
burden
in
his
arms
and
in
that
moment
jennie
raised
her
face
to
his
as
if
to
be
kissed
she
was
really
rather
incorrigible
on
a
different
occasion
the
young
man
might
have
been
irresistibly
tempted
he
had
not
thought
of
mollie
june
for
a
long
time
but
just
now
he
was
no
more
in
a
mood
to
be
enticed
than
crockett
had
been
an
hour
before
he
set
her
lightly
and
quickly
on
her
feet
there
he
said
she
made
a
face
at
him
and
dropped
petulantly
into
a
chair
merriam
turned
to
face
his
victim
the
said
victim
was
now
sufficiently
at
ease
to
open
the
conversation
well
merriam
he
said
you
ve
managed
it
rather
cleverly
very
neat
in
fact
you
have
me
a
prisoner
all
right
but
what
s
the
big
idea
it
seems
to
me
you
ve
only
given
yourself
away
before
i
only
knew
your
name
and
that
you
were
in
connection
with
rockwell
and
that
your
presence
was
desired
at
some
hotel
the
nestor
house
we
ll
say
to
avoid
argument
now
it
s
very
clear
that
you
are
deeply
implicated
in
the
extraordinary
events
that
have
been
happening
otherwise
you
would
have
had
no
sufficient
motive
for
this
rather
violent
not
to
say
melodramatic
line
of
conduct
he
glanced
with
a
smile
at
his
pinioned
arms
this
point
of
view
however
had
already
occurred
to
merriam
and
the
answer
was
that
crockett
knowing
already
of
a
direct
confidential
connection
between
senator
norman
s
double
and
senator
norman
s
new
manager
would
in
a
few
hours
at
most
be
able
to
work
out
the
whole
truth
of
the
situation
so
he
only
answered
his
victim
s
smile
with
another
smile
equally
i
don
t
think
i
ve
given
away
anything
much
he
said
and
i
felt
it
was
time
to
take
out
a
bit
of
insurance
insurance
repeated
crockett
yes
insurance
that
you
will
treat
me
with
that
generosity
which
you
half
promised
a
while
ago
i
promised
nothing
said
crockett
the
smile
fading
out
of
his
eyes
i
refuse
to
give
any
promise
whatever
that
s
all
right
said
merriam
still
in
fact
i
shouldn
t
count
much
on
promises
anyway
you
re
married
i
believe
he
continued
to
crockett
crockett
did
not
reply
and
a
church
member
i
presume
and
a
member
of
a
number
of
highly
respectable
clubs
he
paused
and
waited
smiling
the
smile
was
too
much
for
crockett
after
a
moment
of
holding
in
he
said
sharply
well
well
a
gentleman
who
is
all
those
things
ought
to
be
careful
how
he
accepts
entertainment
from
unattached
young
ladies
like
our
pretty
jennie
here
in
their
flats
at
midnight
and
then
to
margery
go
and
get
your
camera
ready
when
i
was
in
college
merriam
continued
the
fraternity
i
belonged
to
initiated
a
freshman
who
turned
out
to
be
he
wouldn
t
play
cards
wouldn
t
dance
wouldn
t
go
to
the
theater
wouldn
t
smoke
even
refused
coffee
and
tea
above
all
he
simply
wouldn
t
look
at
a
girl
all
he
would
do
was
study
and
go
to
class
and
to
church
and
sunday
school
to
make
it
worse
he
was
a
handsome
cuss
with
loads
of
money
and
his
own
motor
car
he
got
on
the
fellows
nerves
then
a
show
came
to
town
with
a
girl
in
the
chorus
that
two
of
the
fellows
knew
so
a
bunch
of
us
went
to
the
show
and
afterwards
the
two
fellows
who
knew
the
girl
brought
her
back
to
the
chapter
house
in
a
taxi
with
an
opera
cloak
over
the
black
tights
which
she
wore
in
the
last
act
we
gave
her
a
little
supper
and
then
four
of
us
went
upstairs
to
get
the
good
little
boy
he
hadn
t
gone
to
the
show
he
was
studying
his
trigonometry
we
didn
t
have
to
lasso
him
of
course
because
there
were
four
of
us
when
we
brought
him
into
the
dining
room
the
girl
stood
up
and
dropped
off
her
cloak
it
was
worth
something
to
see
his
face
then
we
tied
him
into
a
chair
just
the
same
way
you
re
tied
now
we
set
a
beer
bottle
and
glass
handy
and
the
girl
sat
on
his
knees
and
cocked
one
black
leg
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
put
one
hand
under
his
chin
and
put
her
lips
to
his
cheek
and
then
we
took
the
flash
oh
goody
cried
jennie
ecstatically
pleased
by
this
climax
but
crockett
by
this
time
was
staring
at
the
with
really
venomous
eyes
merriam
avoided
those
eyes
and
addressed
himself
to
jennie
the
appreciative
that
was
all
he
said
we
gave
the
girl
a
bill
and
the
roses
and
sent
her
back
to
the
hotel
in
the
taxi
we
could
only
show
the
picture
to
a
few
chaps
of
course
one
of
the
fellows
did
finally
tell
the
story
to
one
girl
whom
a
lot
of
us
knew
and
showed
her
the
picture
it
worked
fine
the
good
little
boy
s
reputation
was
made
and
he
had
to
live
up
to
it
to
the
extent
at
least
of
becoming
human
he
became
one
of
the
finest
fellows
we
ever
had
the
year
after
he
graduated
merriam
finished
reflectively
he
married
the
one
girl
who
had
seen
the
picture
and
the
chapter
gave
it
to
her
with
their
wedding
present
during
this
sequel
margery
had
returned
with
the
camera
and
with
some
powder
for
which
she
had
had
to
search
in
a
dust
pan
damn
you
cried
the
great
financier
virulently
straining
helplessly
at
the
ropes
which
confined
his
arms
and
legs
if
you
think
it
will
do
you
any
good
to
take
an
indecent
picture
of
me
cut
that
said
merriam
sharply
do
you
want
me
to
tighten
that
noose
again
crockett
subsided
with
a
snort
that
might
have
made
whole
boards
of
directors
tremble
indecent
said
merriam
enjoying
himself
hugely
as
if
he
were
still
in
college
certainly
not
only
pretty
very
pretty
come
jennie
how
about
the
pose
i
ll
show
you
cried
jennie
half
dancing
on
her
toes
with
skirts
fluttering
and
eyes
sparkling
the
more
it
seemed
because
of
crockett
s
bitterly
hostile
regard
she
tripped
around
the
table
and
stood
by
his
side
facing
the
same
way
he
faced
she
plucked
the
rose
from
her
hair
and
stuck
it
behind
crockett
s
ear
it
drooped
grotesquely
over
his
thin
hair
then
laughing
at
the
rose
she
put
one
bare
arm
about
his
neck
her
hand
extending
beyond
his
face
on
the
other
side
give
me
a
cocktail
glass
in
that
hand
she
cried
never
mind
what
s
in
it
anything
merriam
filled
a
glass
from
the
siphon
and
put
it
into
the
hand
referred
to
then
jennie
raised
a
pink
leg
and
put
it
on
the
table
stretching
straight
in
front
of
herself
and
crockett
towards
the
center
of
the
board
amid
the
plates
and
glasses
and
crumpled
napkins
she
put
her
other
hand
under
crockett
s
chin
as
if
about
to
tickle
him
dropped
her
face
close
to
his
and
looked
at
merriam
with
eyes
of
laughing
inquiry
fine
said
merriam
are
you
ready
margery
margery
was
already
pointing
the
camera
not
yet
she
said
he
addressed
himself
to
the
victim
crockett
you
can
of
course
wink
or
twist
your
face
to
spoil
the
picture
if
you
do
i
ll
simply
have
to
choke
you
a
little
before
we
try
again
so
you
d
better
look
pleasant
ready
said
margery
merriam
set
the
dust
pan
with
the
little
heap
of
powder
in
the
center
of
it
on
a
plate
on
the
sideboard
beside
margery
lit
a
match
and
with
a
last
glance
at
jennie
s
extraordinary
pose
and
laughing
face
switched
off
the
lights
and
touched
the
powder
immediately
after
the
flash
merriam
switched
on
the
lights
and
his
eyes
sought
crockett
apparently
the
man
had
faced
the
camera
stolidly
a
grotesque
figure
surmounted
by
the
dangling
flower
and
enveloped
as
it
were
in
jennie
s
acrobatic
pose
all
right
said
merriam
coughing
in
the
smoke
which
filled
the
small
room
but
we
ll
take
one
more
you
never
can
be
sure
of
a
single
film
got
some
more
powder
margery
yes
said
margery
who
had
set
the
camera
down
and
stepped
aside
to
open
a
window
she
passed
into
the
sitting
room
jennie
gingerly
removed
her
leg
from
the
table
and
her
arm
from
about
crockett
s
neck
in
the
latter
process
she
spilled
a
little
of
the
water
from
the
cocktail
glass
unintentionally
let
us
hope
on
crockett
s
head
damn
jennie
quite
regardless
eased
herself
on
her
two
legs
again
gee
she
said
i
couldn
t
have
held
that
pose
much
longer
in
another
second
i
d
have
split
at
the
waist
merriam
laughed
look
what
you
ve
done
he
said
jennie
caught
up
a
napkin
and
mopped
the
face
and
head
sorry
she
cried
sympathetically
i
didn
t
mean
to
wet
him
there
and
she
dropped
a
light
kiss
on
the
cleansed
cheek
and
smiled
her
rosiest
smile
at
the
trussed
victim
crockett
answered
jennie
s
smile
with
a
glare
that
might
have
caused
a
panic
on
the
stock
exchange
it
had
no
very
serious
effect
however
on
jennie
she
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
and
daintily
chucked
him
under
the
chin
that
isn
t
a
nice
look
she
said
at
this
point
margery
returned
with
a
package
of
powder
and
began
to
pour
a
second
little
pile
on
the
dust
pan
take
your
pose
said
merriam
to
jennie
not
that
one
said
jennie
it
s
too
hard
look
she
picked
the
rose
from
above
crockett
s
ear
and
stepped
behind
his
chair
then
she
stooped
till
her
chin
rested
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
let
her
two
bare
arms
drop
past
his
cheeks
till
her
hands
came
together
on
his
shirt
front
in
her
hands
she
held
the
rose
pointing
upward
so
that
the
blossom
was
just
below
his
chin
the
effect
was
distinctly
comical
crockett
s
dour
countenance
with
its
angry
eyes
framed
above
by
jennie
s
pretty
laughing
face
resting
on
the
very
top
of
his
head
at
the
sides
by
her
round
white
arms
and
below
by
the
rose
under
his
chin
fine
merriam
laughed
it
s
better
than
the
other
ready
margery
yes
a
second
time
he
switched
off
the
lights
and
touched
a
match
to
the
powder
again
crockett
had
not
even
blinked
so
far
as
merriam
could
judge
well
satisfied
the
latter
spoke
to
margery
put
that
camera
away
will
you
please
where
it
could
not
be
easily
found
except
by
yourself
margery
picked
up
the
camera
and
departed
into
the
kitchenette
then
let
him
alone
jennie
he
said
for
jennie
had
left
the
back
of
crockett
s
chair
and
perched
herself
on
the
edge
of
the
table
beside
him
and
was
flicking
him
under
the
chin
with
the
rose
all
right
she
said
he
s
no
fun
he
s
very
cross
she
slid
off
the
table
and
dropped
into
a
chair
transferring
her
attention
to
merriam
as
though
in
the
hope
that
he
might
be
less
obdurately
disposed
but
merriam
addressed
himself
to
the
other
man
now
crockett
he
said
this
little
supper
party
and
entertainment
are
over
i
believe
if
you
wish
to
leave
i
shall
be
glad
to
release
you
and
permit
you
to
do
so
crockett
s
reply
was
a
sound
between
a
grunt
and
a
growl
merriam
walked
around
the
table
and
picked
up
the
revolver
where
it
had
fallen
by
the
wall
i
don
t
believe
he
continued
that
it
will
do
you
any
good
to
start
any
when
i
have
freed
you
if
you
do
jennie
and
margery
will
scream
and
i
shall
fire
this
revolver
that
will
bring
in
neighbours
and
probably
the
police
whose
testimony
would
thus
be
added
to
that
of
the
pictures
we
have
taken
as
to
your
manner
of
spending
your
evening
you
will
understand
that
while
i
shall
have
those
pictures
developed
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
shall
not
show
them
to
any
one
except
rockwell
unless
you
compel
me
to
do
so
by
this
time
crockett
had
become
articulate
compel
you
to
do
so
he
repeated
stiffly
may
i
ask
what
you
mean
by
that
well
said
merriam
you
see
i
am
an
enthusiastic
supporter
of
the
reform
league
as
led
by
rockwell
and
senator
norman
and
mayor
black
you
i
understand
are
opposed
to
the
league
and
its
policies
so
long
as
your
opposition
relates
itself
only
to
those
policies
and
involves
only
open
public
discussion
of
their
merits
i
shall
of
course
have
no
reason
to
interfere
but
if
your
opposition
should
take
the
form
of
any
personal
attack
on
senator
norman
let
us
say
i
should
feel
compelled
to
retaliate
by
a
personal
attack
upon
you
making
use
of
these
pictures
we
have
taken
and
the
story
that
will
readily
weave
itself
about
them
do
you
see
see
crockett
cried
of
course
i
see
blackmail
how
much
do
you
want
for
that
camera
name
your
price
it
has
no
cash
price
returned
merriam
steadily
now
if
i
release
you
will
you
leave
quietly
for
a
long
moment
the
financier
stared
at
the
younger
man
who
had
worsted
him
then
at
this
moment
he
said
acridly
i
certainly
have
no
other
desire
than
to
get
away
from
this
place
and
to
be
rid
of
my
present
companionship
merriam
was
tempted
to
laugh
at
the
stilted
dignity
of
this
phraseology
but
he
managed
to
keep
a
straight
face
very
well
he
said
margery
for
margery
had
just
returned
from
the
kitchenette
minus
the
camera
help
me
untie
him
will
you
feet
first
margery
and
merriam
knelt
for
a
moment
at
the
two
sides
of
crockett
s
chair
and
released
his
two
legs
then
merriam
again
put
the
table
between
himself
and
crockett
and
stood
waiting
revolver
in
hand
leaving
to
margery
the
work
of
unbinding
the
arms
he
was
afraid
that
his
own
near
presence
to
crockett
when
the
latter
found
himself
free
might
tempt
him
irresistibly
to
personal
assault
in
the
moment
during
which
he
stood
waiting
he
became
conscious
that
jennie
half
reclining
in
the
chair
into
which
she
had
dropped
was
smiling
at
him
a
pretty
confidential
smile
which
he
did
not
understand
but
he
had
no
time
to
consider
jennie
just
then
for
margery
had
completed
her
work
the
last
piece
of
rope
fell
on
the
floor
and
she
lifted
the
slip
noose
from
about
crockett
s
neck
he
had
been
rather
tightly
bound
and
did
not
instantly
have
the
full
use
of
his
limbs
margery
took
his
arm
to
assist
him
my
coat
and
hat
he
said
not
looking
at
merriam
in
the
sitting
room
said
margery
he
turned
himself
in
that
direction
and
in
a
jerky
walk
with
some
support
from
margery
moved
towards
and
through
the
portières
he
had
disdained
to
cast
so
much
as
a
glance
at
either
merriam
or
jennie
jennie
resented
this
old
crosspatch
she
cried
merriam
stepped
hastily
to
the
portières
and
peeped
through
crockett
had
caught
up
his
light
overcoat
and
silk
hat
from
a
chair
he
refused
margery
s
offer
to
help
him
on
with
his
coat
and
made
already
moving
more
naturally
for
the
hall
door
margery
followed
him
the
door
opened
closed
again
margery
returned
from
the
hallway
merriam
advanced
through
the
portières
into
the
sitting
room
well
he
exclaimed
well
returned
margery
with
a
dry
laugh
the
first
laugh
merriam
had
heard
from
her
during
the
whole
evening
see
what
he
does
in
the
street
she
added
raise
the
shade
about
a
foot
i
ll
turn
off
the
light
merriam
acted
promptly
on
this
excellent
hint
in
a
moment
the
room
was
in
darkness
and
he
was
kneeling
by
the
window
watching
the
street
below
which
was
fairly
well
illuminated
from
arc
lights
at
either
corner
part
way
down
the
block
on
the
other
side
of
the
roadway
a
car
presumably
a
taxi
stood
by
the
curb
with
a
man
walking
up
and
down
beside
it
jennie
s
flat
was
too
high
up
for
merriam
to
be
able
to
see
the
sidewalk
immediately
below
if
therefore
crockett
on
emerging
from
the
building
merely
walked
away
he
would
see
nothing
but
this
was
hardly
likely
presently
sure
enough
the
taxi
showed
sudden
signs
of
life
the
man
hastily
got
in
and
the
car
rolled
forward
crossing
the
street
diagonally
and
stopped
directly
below
merriam
s
window
crockett
had
come
out
and
signalled
it
a
moment
later
it
shot
away
down
the
block
and
turned
the
corner
merriam
still
knelt
by
the
window
peering
into
the
street
he
was
looking
for
signs
of
any
remaining
watchers
for
he
had
his
own
exit
to
think
of
rockwell
had
wanted
him
to
come
at
once
to
the
hotel
as
he
knelt
there
in
the
dark
he
suddenly
sensed
a
warm
fragrant
body
close
beside
his
own
a
pair
of
soft
bare
arms
slipped
about
his
neck
it
was
fine
jennie
s
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
you
re
a
nice
boy
she
had
crept
up
behind
him
in
the
dark
margery
must
have
left
the
room
for
a
moment
merriam
knelt
in
fascinated
silent
rigidity
when
he
moved
it
was
only
to
turn
his
head
and
the
turning
of
his
head
brought
his
face
close
to
jennie
s
which
with
the
dim
light
from
the
street
upon
it
smiled
at
him
with
a
kind
of
saucy
tenderness
it
was
the
face
of
a
pretty
child
with
the
lure
of
womanhood
added
but
with
nothing
else
of
maturity
in
it
her
lips
puckered
kiss
me
she
whispered
as
he
still
only
stared
she
quickly
leaned
forward
a
couple
of
inches
more
her
lips
rested
on
his
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
for
an
instant
merriam
s
lips
responded
he
half
turned
on
one
knee
his
arms
involuntarily
closed
about
the
seductive
little
body
he
felt
the
short
silk
skirts
crush
deliciously
against
his
legs
and
then
a
grotesque
sort
of
composite
picture
of
all
the
things
he
ought
to
remember
including
rockwell
norman
mollie
june
and
the
members
of
the
riceville
school
board
rushed
across
his
mind
he
struggled
to
his
feet
pushing
jennie
not
roughly
away
margery
he
called
yes
came
margery
s
voice
from
the
dining
room
turn
on
the
lights
by
the
time
margery
had
stepped
through
the
portières
and
pushed
the
switch
jennie
had
thrown
herself
face
downward
on
the
davenport
crying
nobody
loves
me
she
sobbed
margery
standing
by
the
switch
looked
from
merriam
at
the
window
to
jennie
on
the
couch
and
back
again
her
expression
indicated
no
bewilderment
rather
a
humorously
cynical
comprehension
she
knew
her
jennie
at
any
rate
that
glance
steadied
the
young
man
after
meeting
it
for
a
moment
he
turned
to
jennie
poor
little
girl
he
felt
that
he
understood
her
perfectly
there
was
a
side
of
himself
that
was
like
that
only
he
had
other
sides
powerfully
developed
and
jennie
had
no
other
sides
all
his
young
chivalry
rose
up
in
alliance
with
the
missionary
spirit
of
the
teacher
he
desired
greatly
to
help
her
after
an
instant
s
hesitation
he
crossed
the
room
and
drew
up
a
chair
beside
the
davenport
jennie
he
said
listen
go
away
said
jennie
i
going
away
in
a
minute
but
i
want
to
tell
you
something
first
her
sobbing
ceased
but
he
waited
till
she
asked
well
what
there
somebody
who
loves
you
hopefully
jennie
raised
her
head
and
turned
her
face
to
him
still
oddly
pretty
in
spite
of
the
rouge
but
after
a
moment
s
look
she
said
resentfully
it
isn
t
you
no
said
merriam
it
isn
t
i
even
at
this
rate
the
discussion
was
apparently
interesting
enough
to
rouse
her
with
a
sudden
movement
she
curled
herself
up
half
sitting
half
reclining
in
a
corner
of
the
davenport
and
smoothed
the
crumpled
skirts
over
her
knees
do
you
mean
george
she
asked
no
said
merriam
i
mean
mr
simpson
simpson
she
laughed
derisively
not
prettily
at
all
a
waiter
listen
jennie
simpson
is
a
fine
fellow
with
lots
of
brains
and
lots
of
courage
he
has
shown
both
within
the
last
hours
he
s
rendered
a
very
important
service
to
rockwell
and
senator
norman
and
they
re
going
to
give
him
a
lot
of
money
for
a
reward
i
don
t
know
how
much
maybe
five
thousand
dollars
and
he
s
crazy
about
you
he
ll
marry
you
in
a
minute
if
you
ll
let
him
in
spite
of
george
he
ll
take
you
away
on
a
fine
trip
anywhere
you
want
to
go
and
afterwards
he
ll
set
up
in
a
business
of
his
own
a
café
or
whatever
he
likes
you
ll
have
a
real
home
and
a
husband
and
money
enough
and
friends
it
ll
be
a
lot
better
than
this
stuff
like
it
really
would
think
it
over
jennie
on
the
last
words
he
rose
he
s
right
cried
margery
who
had
drawn
near
shut
up
marge
said
jennie
but
merriam
looking
closely
at
her
with
the
sharp
eye
of
a
teacher
to
see
whether
or
not
his
point
had
gone
home
was
satisfied
he
was
sure
that
she
would
think
it
over
in
spite
of
herself
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
ten
minutes
after
one
i
must
telephone
at
once
to
rockwell
in
senator
norman
s
rooms
at
the
hotel
de
soto
he
said
to
margery
yes
said
margery
the
hotel
number
is
madison
thank
you
without
looking
again
at
jennie
he
went
to
the
telephone
in
the
dining
room
in
a
moment
he
had
the
hotel
and
had
asked
to
be
connected
with
senator
norman
s
rooms
it
was
rockwell
s
voice
that
answered
hello
this
is
merriam
thank
god
where
are
you
at
jennie
s
still
what
the
devil
was
the
ruction
there
when
i
called
up
i
ll
tell
you
about
that
later
do
you
still
want
me
to
come
to
the
hotel
certainly
as
fast
as
you
can
you
got
the
senator
back
all
right
yes
but
he
s
pretty
sick
caught
more
cold
i
guess
hobart
s
worried
about
him
you
ll
have
to
stay
over
another
day
all
right
and
make
that
speech
merriam
groaned
listen
said
rockwell
you
ll
have
to
be
mighty
careful
about
getting
into
the
hotel
you
aren
t
senator
norman
just
now
you
know
the
senator
has
already
returned
to
the
hotel
openly
with
me
three
hours
ago
and
is
sick
in
his
rooms
we
ll
have
to
smuggle
you
in
without
any
one
s
seeing
you
but
i
have
a
plan
or
rather
simpson
has
you
d
better
come
down
on
the
elevated
that
ll
be
better
than
a
taxi
this
time
no
chauffeur
to
tell
on
you
be
sure
you
get
away
from
there
without
being
followed
margery
ll
show
you
a
way
get
off
at
madison
and
wabash
simpson
will
meet
you
there
and
smuggle
you
in
the
back
way
you
can
come
right
away
yes
then
for
heaven
s
sake
come
we
ll
talk
after
you
get
here
he
hung
up
merriam
stared
at
the
instrument
as
he
slowly
replaced
his
own
receiver
another
day
and
make
that
speech
would
this
kaleidoscopic
unreal
phantasm
of
adventures
never
end
when
would
he
wake
up
he
perceived
suddenly
that
he
was
very
tired
but
he
must
brace
up
sufficiently
to
get
back
to
the
hotel
there
doubtless
he
would
be
permitted
to
go
to
bed
and
snatch
at
least
a
few
hours
sleep
before
the
speech
he
turned
and
found
margery
standing
between
the
portières
watching
him
well
she
said
sharply
i
must
must
get
dressed
he
finished
realising
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
leapt
out
of
bed
with
his
revolver
to
divert
crockett
from
the
telephone
that
he
was
attired
only
in
pajamas
rockwell
says
you
can
tell
me
a
way
to
get
away
from
here
without
being
seen
by
any
watchers
yes
said
margery
go
and
dress
i
ll
attend
to
that
he
went
into
the
bedroom
and
began
to
get
into
his
clothes
working
mechanically
presently
he
was
ready
though
with
such
a
loose
and
rakish
bow
as
he
had
never
before
disported
and
emerged
into
the
dining
room
there
he
encountered
a
cheering
spectacle
margery
was
seated
at
the
table
between
a
coffee
percolator
efficiently
bubbling
and
an
electric
toaster
she
was
buttering
hot
toast
jennie
sat
at
one
side
of
the
table
a
pale
blue
kimono
now
covered
her
dancing
costume
and
she
looked
quite
demure
she
raised
her
eyes
almost
shyly
as
merriam
entered
well
he
exclaimed
this
is
grand
margery
you
certainly
are
a
trump
margery
s
rather
sallow
cheeks
flushed
slightly
you
ll
need
it
was
all
she
said
and
proceeded
to
fill
a
cup
for
him
from
the
percolator
how
do
i
get
away
merriam
asked
as
he
sipped
back
stairs
said
margery
succinctly
i
ll
show
you
munching
toast
he
enquired
the
whereabouts
of
the
nearest
elevated
station
and
was
duly
instructed
he
had
a
second
cup
of
the
black
coffee
margery
did
not
take
any
and
would
not
give
jennie
any
we
go
straight
to
bed
she
said
decidedly
from
time
to
time
merriam
cast
an
unwilling
glance
at
jennie
sitting
downcast
and
out
of
it
on
margery
s
other
side
about
the
third
time
jennie
intercepted
his
glance
and
answered
it
with
a
small
wistful
smile
after
that
he
would
not
look
again
in
a
few
minutes
of
course
this
very
early
breakfast
it
was
somewhere
around
two
o
clock
was
over
and
merriam
rose
i
must
be
off
he
said
and
hesitated
i
am
very
much
indebted
to
both
of
you
for
all
the
help
you
have
given
me
this
evening
inwardly
he
abused
himself
for
his
stiltedness
it
was
like
his
telling
mollie
june
he
was
glad
to
have
helped
her
in
algebra
jennie
rose
too
and
came
around
the
table
towards
him
she
had
suddenly
summoned
back
a
smile
and
she
moved
daintily
inside
the
blue
kimono
above
the
stalk
of
that
straight
demure
japanesy
blue
her
head
nodded
like
a
bright
blossom
with
its
fair
wavy
hair
blue
eyes
and
childishly
rounded
cheeks
still
gaudy
with
the
remains
of
rouge
she
tripped
forward
till
she
was
almost
touching
merriam
stopped
and
suddenly
raised
her
eyes
to
him
kiss
me
she
said
we
may
suspect
that
it
was
a
sort
of
point
of
honour
with
jennie
to
retrieve
the
rebuff
she
had
received
in
the
sitting
room
as
for
merriam
in
spite
of
the
obvious
deliberateness
of
this
assault
i
am
not
perfectly
sure
i
could
answer
for
him
if
it
had
not
been
for
margery
but
margery
s
presence
saved
him
from
serious
temptation
instead
of
stooping
to
kiss
the
lifted
lips
he
caught
jennie
s
hand
that
hung
at
her
side
and
stepping
back
half
a
step
raised
the
hand
and
kissed
it
sometimes
the
inspirations
of
youth
are
singularly
happy
it
seems
to
me
that
this
one
was
of
that
kind
it
involved
neither
yielding
nor
discourtesy
jennie
was
somewhat
taken
aback
yet
she
could
not
be
hurt
by
a
gesture
so
gallant
jennie
he
said
i
hope
to
be
the
best
man
at
your
wedding
before
long
oh
she
said
and
withdrew
her
hand
then
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
and
a
last
quite
shy
glance
at
merriam
she
suddenly
gathered
up
the
skirts
of
the
kimono
and
ran
into
the
sitting
room
are
you
ready
said
margery
dryly
my
coat
i
haven
t
a
hat
he
added
remembering
that
under
rockwell
s
instructions
he
had
left
this
article
in
the
taxi
in
which
they
had
come
to
the
flat
your
coat
s
in
the
hall
said
margery
i
can
get
you
a
hat
too
the
dining
room
was
connected
directly
with
the
hallway
and
in
a
moment
margery
had
returned
with
merriam
s
light
overcoat
and
with
a
man
s
derby
probably
norman
s
property
thank
you
said
merriam
taking
them
this
way
she
replied
moving
towards
the
kitchenette
in
the
kitchenette
he
was
momentarily
surprised
to
see
margery
opening
a
tin
box
labeled
bread
was
she
going
to
equip
him
with
a
lunch
but
she
drew
out
not
a
loaf
but
the
camera
you
ll
want
to
take
this
along
she
said
indeed
yes
then
he
followed
her
out
on
to
the
back
porch
where
earlier
ages
ago
it
seemed
he
had
deposited
the
stepladder
now
said
margery
you
go
down
these
stairs
and
diagonally
across
the
court
to
that
archway
see
she
pointed
that
brings
you
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
block
nobody
will
be
looking
for
you
there
and
the
elevated
station
is
three
and
blocks
west
put
on
your
hat
and
coat
i
ll
hold
it
thank
you
so
much
said
merriam
as
the
coat
slipped
on
then
he
turned
took
off
his
hat
again
and
held
out
his
hand
margery
he
said
shaking
hands
heartily
thank
you
for
everything
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
each
other
with
mutual
respect
then
merriam
said
i
m
going
to
send
simpson
around
to
see
jennie
shan
t
i
you
can
try
it
said
margery
she
went
back
into
the
kitchenette
and
closed
the
door
madison
and
wabash
shouted
the
guard
merriam
started
picked
up
his
camera
and
made
for
the
door
he
had
scarcely
heard
the
other
stations
called
and
thanked
his
stars
that
he
had
waked
up
for
this
one
he
descended
the
stairs
from
the
elevated
platform
and
found
simpson
waiting
good
morning
simpson
good
morning
rockwell
says
you
can
get
me
into
the
hotel
unnoticed
simpson
looked
at
him
sideways
hesitated
then
turned
and
started
slowly
west
merriam
fell
into
step
beside
him
and
for
a
moment
wondered
obtusely
what
ailed
the
man
then
he
understood
of
course
he
wanted
news
of
jennie
perhaps
he
was
suspicious
as
to
how
merriam
might
have
spent
his
time
in
that
apartment
perhaps
he
like
margery
knew
his
jennie
only
too
well
to
set
his
mind
at
rest
merriam
plunged
at
once
into
a
sketchy
summary
of
the
events
at
the
flat
crockett
s
arrival
almost
as
soon
as
you
had
left
he
placed
it
his
own
telling
of
his
story
crockett
s
being
half
convinced
jennie
s
plan
the
supper
party
without
reference
to
jennie
s
change
of
costume
or
the
dancing
on
the
table
rockwell
s
telephone
call
the
tying
up
and
the
flash
lights
i
have
the
films
here
he
added
exhibiting
the
camera
as
tangible
evidence
that
he
was
not
yarning
can
you
get
them
developed
for
me
in
the
morning
yes
said
simpson
in
a
much
less
frigid
tone
than
before
he
took
the
camera
after
crockett
had
gone
merriam
continued
smoothly
i
talked
to
jennie
about
you
i
told
her
she
ought
to
marry
you
and
how
well
you
ve
shown
up
in
this
affair
and
that
senator
norman
and
rockwell
are
going
to
pay
you
a
bit
of
money
for
it
which
you
ve
certainly
earned
and
that
you
would
take
her
away
on
a
little
trip
anywhere
she
wanted
to
go
and
then
set
up
in
a
business
of
your
own
somewhere
and
that
she
would
be
a
lot
happier
that
way
than
now
an
older
man
more
sensitive
to
the
dynamite
in
the
situation
would
probably
have
spoken
less
freely
and
less
successfully
whatever
else
simpson
may
have
felt
he
could
not
question
his
companion
s
youthful
candour
and
good
will
after
perhaps
a
dozen
steps
he
spoke
in
a
carefully
controlled
voice
what
did
she
say
she
didn
t
answer
me
lied
merriam
i
told
her
to
think
it
over
she
was
impressed
all
right
and
when
i
left
i
told
margery
i
was
going
to
send
you
around
what
did
margery
say
asked
simpson
quickly
she
said
yes
you
should
come
simpson
drew
a
deep
breath
and
stopped
short
at
a
corner
i
m
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
he
said
looking
quickly
at
merriam
and
quickly
away
again
merriam
held
out
his
hand
good
luck
he
said
simpson
grasped
the
hand
and
shook
it
intensely
then
resuming
his
really
admirable
he
said
we
turn
down
here
i
m
going
to
take
you
up
a
fire
escape
it
s
the
only
way
you
can
t
go
into
a
hotel
in
the
regular
way
even
at
this
time
of
night
without
being
seen
they
turned
into
an
alley
which
ran
behind
the
hotel
de
soto
and
presently
came
to
a
door
a
servants
entrance
in
the
ugly
blank
wall
of
yellow
brick
simpson
opened
the
door
and
they
passed
into
a
bare
hallway
lighted
at
intervals
by
unshaded
incandescents
many
doors
of
yellow
pine
opened
on
both
sides
of
this
hall
but
simpson
walking
rapidly
and
quietly
passed
them
all
turned
into
a
further
stretch
of
hallway
narrower
and
still
more
dimly
lighted
and
stopped
before
a
door
of
iron
evidently
a
fire
door
he
got
out
a
key
and
unlocked
this
door
and
they
emerged
into
the
air
again
in
the
inner
court
of
the
hotel
a
great
dismal
well
the
depository
of
drifts
of
soot
accentuated
here
and
there
by
scraps
of
paper
and
other
rubbish
and
the
haunt
for
reasons
difficult
to
understand
of
the
indomitable
grimy
wild
pigeons
of
the
loop
simpson
closed
the
iron
door
behind
them
and
began
a
searching
scrutiny
of
the
rows
of
windows
all
but
half
a
dozen
or
so
were
dark
it
looked
safe
satisfied
simpson
walked
twenty
feet
or
more
along
the
side
of
the
court
and
stopped
below
a
fire
escape
the
platform
at
the
lower
end
of
the
iron
stairway
was
placed
too
high
for
a
man
to
reach
it
from
the
ground
unaided
give
me
a
boost
said
simpson
he
stooped
and
placed
the
camera
on
the
ground
in
a
moment
merriam
had
hoisted
him
up
so
that
he
could
catch
hold
of
the
end
of
the
platform
and
pull
himself
on
to
it
then
simpson
lay
down
on
his
stomach
and
dropped
his
arms
over
the
edge
of
the
platform
merriam
first
handed
up
the
camera
and
then
with
a
little
jump
caught
his
hands
and
was
drawn
up
until
he
in
his
turn
could
get
hold
of
the
edge
of
the
landing
and
scramble
on
to
it
a
moment
later
they
were
erect
and
had
begun
stealthily
to
mount
the
narrow
stairs
it
seemed
to
merriam
that
they
went
up
interminably
a
short
flight
a
turn
another
short
flight
along
a
platform
past
sleeping
windows
another
flight
he
got
out
of
breath
and
began
to
feel
very
tired
the
effect
of
margery
s
coffee
was
wearing
off
but
at
last
simpson
stopped
on
one
of
the
platforms
and
peered
through
a
window
it
was
one
of
which
the
shades
were
not
drawn
at
all
and
was
open
about
two
inches
at
the
bottom
this
is
it
said
simpson
and
he
stooped
opened
the
window
and
climbed
in
as
soon
as
merriam
had
followed
simpson
closed
the
window
and
drew
the
shade
then
he
crossed
the
dark
room
and
pushed
a
switch
where
are
we
asked
merriam
this
room
is
next
to
senator
norman
s
bedroom
said
simpson
on
the
other
side
from
the
sitting
room
the
couple
who
had
it
left
this
evening
and
rockwell
has
taken
it
for
you
under
the
name
of
wilson
rockwell
will
be
expecting
us
he
moved
to
a
door
at
the
side
and
knocked
softly
four
times
once
twice
and
once
again
almost
immediately
a
key
was
turned
on
the
other
side
the
door
was
opened
and
rockwell
stood
surveying
them
there
was
only
a
dim
light
in
the
room
behind
him
with
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
bed
where
the
sick
senator
lay
the
same
bed
in
which
merriam
had
played
at
being
sick
on
the
previous
afternoon
he
entered
the
new
room
and
closed
the
door
you
ve
made
it
he
said
thank
heaven
you
weren
t
seen
simpson
i
think
not
sir
he
looked
closely
at
merriam
you
re
tired
he
said
i
sure
am
well
so
am
i
what
a
day
and
will
be
as
bad
maybe
worse
never
again
will
i
father
an
impostor
but
we
ve
got
to
see
it
through
this
time
sit
down
have
a
cigarette
and
tell
me
what
happened
at
the
flat
then
i
ll
let
you
go
to
bed
and
snatch
a
few
hours
sleep
you
must
be
in
fighting
trim
you
know
for
the
speech
merriam
took
the
proffered
cigarette
and
dropped
gratefully
into
a
chair
rockwell
and
simpson
also
sat
down
how
s
senator
norman
merriam
asked
sick
hobart
looks
serious
but
he
says
he
ll
pull
around
in
a
day
or
two
he
s
dosing
him
heavily
you
ve
simply
got
to
stay
by
us
and
play
the
game
until
he
s
on
his
feet
again
i
suppose
so
well
he
was
about
to
repeat
the
summary
of
the
events
of
his
evening
which
he
had
already
given
simpson
so
as
to
get
it
over
and
get
to
bed
but
before
he
could
begin
a
knock
sounded
at
the
side
door
through
which
rockwell
had
entered
simpson
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
it
was
hobart
miss
norman
and
norman
want
to
come
in
he
said
rockwell
hesitated
no
doubt
he
would
have
preferred
to
hear
merriam
s
story
himself
first
without
even
aunt
mary
present
merriam
meanwhile
sat
up
suddenly
forgetting
his
fatigue
he
was
to
see
mollie
june
still
that
night
he
had
not
hoped
for
that
i
supposed
they
would
have
gone
to
bed
he
said
to
cover
his
involuntary
show
of
interest
no
said
rockwell
after
the
dinner
party
they
waited
for
me
to
come
back
with
norman
of
course
then
he
was
so
ill
that
hobart
kept
us
all
busy
for
a
couple
of
hours
doing
things
we
didn
t
want
to
get
in
a
nurse
on
account
of
you
you
know
and
then
they
wanted
to
wait
till
you
came
we
expected
you
a
long
time
ago
well
he
added
turning
to
the
physician
tell
them
to
come
along
it
was
at
least
a
minute
before
they
arrived
merriam
was
oddly
nervous
he
had
been
through
strange
scenes
since
he
had
left
mollie
june
in
the
peacock
cabaret
and
she
must
have
divined
as
much
they
entered
aunt
mary
first
with
mollie
june
behind
her
and
merriam
and
rockwell
rose
the
two
women
were
dressed
just
as
they
had
been
at
the
dinner
party
aunt
mary
in
the
black
evening
gown
and
mollie
june
in
the
filmy
rose
mollie
june
looked
just
a
little
pale
and
tired
but
aunt
mary
had
not
turned
a
hair
well
young
man
began
the
older
woman
briskly
you
ve
kept
us
up
till
a
pretty
time
of
night
what
was
happening
there
where
you
were
when
rockwell
telephoned
sit
down
and
tell
us
evidently
aunt
mary
conscious
of
the
ungodly
hour
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
allow
merriam
time
for
even
a
formal
greeting
of
her
young
who
had
stopped
uncertainly
in
the
doorway
but
merriam
was
not
to
be
hurried
to
quite
that
degree
whatever
the
time
of
night
or
morning
might
be
he
turned
to
mollie
june
you
re
coming
in
aren
t
you
take
this
chair
he
pushed
a
rocker
towards
her
concerned
at
her
evident
fatigue
she
came
forward
and
sat
down
then
raised
her
eyes
to
him
with
a
grave
thank
you
for
a
moment
merriam
did
not
understand
that
steady
unsmiling
look
then
he
thought
he
did
understand
it
had
a
questioning
quality
mollie
june
s
mind
was
at
ease
now
about
her
husband
since
he
was
back
and
not
supposed
to
be
seriously
ill
and
she
like
simpson
earlier
was
wondering
not
that
it
concerned
her
of
course
how
merriam
had
spent
the
night
so
large
a
part
of
it
at
jennie
s
flat
she
too
knew
jennie
to
the
extent
at
least
of
having
seen
and
in
a
measure
comprehended
her
perhaps
even
in
a
mollie
june
there
is
that
which
enables
her
to
understand
a
jennie
and
her
lure
for
a
youthful
male
he
remembered
mollie
june
s
description
of
her
and
the
cool
detachment
with
which
it
had
been
uttered
she
s
pretty
and
sweet
and
warm
for
just
an
instant
merriam
was
slightly
confused
he
had
verified
that
description
all
of
it
it
is
to
be
feared
that
his
embarrassment
slight
and
merely
instantaneous
though
it
was
did
not
escape
mollie
june
she
dropped
her
eyes
still
unsmiling
merriam
s
second
sketch
of
his
evening
s
adventures
differed
from
the
one
he
had
given
simpson
in
being
fuller
and
in
two
particular
points
first
of
course
in
omitting
reference
to
his
missionary
efforts
in
simpson
s
behalf
which
however
laudable
were
hardly
for
the
ears
of
mollie
june
and
second
in
including
mention
of
jennie
s
change
into
her
ballet
costume
because
he
realised
as
he
talked
that
the
pictures
to
be
developed
in
the
morning
would
exhibit
that
detail
most
unmistakably
and
that
he
would
do
well
to
prepare
mollie
june
s
mind
and
simpson
s
for
that
matter
in
advance
but
he
laid
his
emphasis
on
the
more
dramatic
episodes
the
hurled
revolver
the
tying
up
the
flash
lights
and
crockett
s
angry
exit
he
told
it
humorously
and
well
and
was
rewarded
by
mollie
june
s
interest
her
questioning
gravity
disappeared
and
she
followed
him
with
eager
attention
and
with
a
return
of
pretty
colour
to
her
cheeks
aunt
mary
and
rockwell
not
to
mention
simpson
also
listened
attentively
when
merriam
had
finished
they
looked
at
each
other
well
said
rockwell
i
m
not
sure
but
that
it
would
have
been
better
to
let
him
go
as
soon
as
you
had
told
him
your
yarn
but
on
the
whole
i
think
you
did
mighty
well
those
pictures
may
come
in
handy
aunt
mary
rose
you
certainly
are
an
enterprising
young
man
merriam
she
said
dryly
now
go
to
bed
and
get
some
sleep
you
make
your
début
as
an
orator
at
noon
you
know
come
mollie
june
good
night
miss
norman
said
merriam
and
he
advanced
to
mollie
june
who
had
also
risen
good
night
mollie
june
he
dropped
his
voice
for
the
last
three
words
and
held
out
his
hand
she
took
it
with
an
unconscious
happy
smile
good
night
john
she
said
whatever
she
may
have
feared
or
suspected
his
story
had
established
an
alibi
for
him
reform
quarter
to
ten
said
rockwell
cheerily
i
ve
let
you
sleep
to
the
last
possible
moment
here
s
your
breakfast
on
the
stand
better
eat
it
and
drink
your
coffee
first
then
a
shave
and
get
at
this
he
indicated
a
small
pile
of
manuscript
on
the
writing
table
your
speech
senator
he
grinned
good
lord
groaned
merriam
remembering
everything
he
perceived
also
that
he
was
to
breakfast
alone
no
mollie
june
but
the
sight
of
the
manuscript
fascinated
and
aroused
him
he
realised
as
he
had
not
done
before
that
within
a
few
hours
he
was
to
make
a
public
address
in
a
great
chicago
club
before
many
of
the
city
s
most
prominent
men
and
women
on
what
subject
even
he
had
no
idea
good
lord
he
said
again
and
put
his
feet
out
how
s
senator
norman
he
asked
sleeping
now
said
rockwell
hobart
thinks
he
can
get
him
on
his
feet
by
night
he
s
due
to
start
for
cairo
this
evening
you
know
on
a
stumping
trip
then
quickly
you
ll
find
these
sliced
oranges
refreshing
have
your
bath
first
if
you
want
to
merriam
was
in
the
midst
of
his
breakfast
when
rockwell
returned
by
the
way
he
said
here
are
your
pictures
and
he
took
some
unmounted
prints
from
an
envelope
merriam
reached
for
them
with
curiosity
and
something
like
trepidation
they
were
not
good
flash
lights
a
little
blurred
but
the
faces
and
attitudes
were
unmistakable
jennie
s
foot
and
leg
extending
forward
across
the
table
were
very
much
in
evidence
in
the
first
of
them
rather
striking
poses
commented
rockwell
jennie
s
invention
said
merriam
defensively
no
doubt
well
they
could
hardly
be
better
for
their
purpose
i
think
crockett
will
go
slow
all
right
have
has
miss
norman
seen
them
yes
and
simpson
of
course
for
a
moment
rockwell
quizzically
regarded
merriam
s
face
in
which
a
further
unspoken
question
was
anxiously
plain
then
he
answered
it
no
one
else
norman
is
still
sleeping
i
m
not
sure
aunt
mary
will
consider
them
proper
pictures
for
her
to
see
anyway
come
he
added
briskly
you
ve
eaten
only
one
piece
of
toast
you
must
get
outside
of
at
least
one
more
piece
and
then
shave
i
ll
strop
your
razor
for
you
i
m
your
valet
this
morning
senator
with
a
sigh
merriam
glanced
at
the
waiting
speech
and
tackled
a
second
piece
of
toast
with
the
feeling
that
its
mastication
was
a
task
of
almost
impossible
difficulty
he
achieved
it
however
to
the
rhythmic
accompaniment
of
rockwell
s
stropping
consumed
another
cup
of
coffee
his
third
i
regret
to
say
and
proceeded
to
shave
at
last
merriam
was
collared
and
tied
and
was
slipping
into
his
coat
rockwell
rose
and
laid
down
the
manuscript
ready
he
said
very
good
you
can
get
to
work
it
s
a
quarter
past
ten
the
luncheon
is
at
but
we
shan
t
appear
at
the
luncheon
itself
too
dangerous
you
d
have
to
meet
a
lot
of
men
who
know
the
senator
meet
them
face
to
face
in
cold
daylight
and
talk
to
them
we
d
never
get
away
with
it
so
i
ll
telephone
that
you
ve
been
detained
by
important
business
but
will
be
in
for
the
speeches
that
way
we
ll
come
in
by
ourselves
with
everybody
else
set
and
no
opportunity
for
personal
confabulations
you
ll
have
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
their
eyes
of
course
but
you
can
do
that
earnestly
for
a
moment
he
scrutinised
merriam
s
face
and
figure
as
if
to
reassure
himself
that
the
astounding
imposture
had
been
and
was
still
really
possible
yes
he
continued
confidently
that
ll
be
all
right
the
speeches
are
scheduled
to
begin
at
we
ll
leave
here
at
five
or
ten
minutes
after
one
that
gives
you
nearly
three
hours
to
salt
down
the
speech
you
can
learn
it
verbatim
or
only
master
the
outline
and
substance
and
give
it
in
your
own
words
perhaps
you
d
better
learn
a
good
deal
of
it
just
as
it
is
aunt
mary
has
it
of
the
senator
s
pet
words
and
phrases
your
own
style
might
be
too
different
do
you
commit
easily
fairly
so
said
merriam
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
speech
itself
presented
few
terrors
to
him
he
had
done
a
good
deal
of
debating
and
declaiming
in
college
and
of
course
in
his
capacity
as
principal
of
the
high
school
he
was
called
upon
for
a
few
words
on
every
conceivable
occasion
in
riceville
good
go
to
it
then
i
ll
make
myself
scarce
here
are
cigarettes
you
won
t
be
disturbed
senator
if
you
want
anything
knock
on
this
door
either
hobart
or
i
will
answer
grinning
rockwell
departed
into
the
real
the
sick
senator
s
bedroom
leaving
merriam
with
the
typewritten
manuscript
he
worked
away
for
a
couple
of
hours
sometimes
sitting
down
more
often
walking
back
and
forth
occasionally
refreshing
himself
with
a
cigarette
and
faithfully
learning
by
heart
aunt
mary
s
senator
norman
s
speech
on
municipal
reform
by
half
past
twelve
he
had
mastered
it
to
his
satisfaction
he
decided
to
go
through
with
it
once
more
by
the
clock
it
was
designed
as
he
knew
from
a
pencil
note
at
the
top
of
the
first
page
to
take
thirty
minutes
he
did
so
and
came
out
at
the
end
by
five
minutes
to
one
evidently
his
delivery
was
a
little
more
rapid
than
senator
norman
s
he
must
remember
to
speak
slowly
he
had
just
reached
this
conclusion
when
a
knock
sounded
at
the
side
door
and
rockwell
entered
i
ve
got
it
by
heart
said
merriam
good
come
into
the
sitting
room
then
you
re
to
have
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
sandwich
before
you
start
fine
i
am
a
bit
hollow
how
s
the
senator
rockwell
looked
worried
but
answered
sleeping
again
now
come
along
if
you
re
ready
in
a
minute
merriam
bathed
his
face
and
hands
folded
the
speech
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
followed
rockwell
across
the
senator
s
bedroom
with
just
a
glance
at
the
sick
man
in
the
bed
and
a
nod
to
hobart
who
sat
by
the
window
with
a
newspaper
into
the
sitting
room
after
his
morning
of
intense
solitary
labour
he
was
somewhat
nonplused
for
a
moment
by
the
size
of
the
company
he
found
assembled
there
aunt
mary
and
mollie
june
of
course
alicia
wayward
and
father
murray
he
said
good
morning
to
each
of
them
alicia
reminded
him
that
it
was
really
afternoon
now
we
shall
meet
black
in
the
car
said
rockwell
then
the
roll
of
the
conspirators
will
be
complete
mollie
june
who
had
had
no
speech
to
learn
had
slept
late
and
was
now
as
blooming
as
ever
we
re
all
going
to
hear
you
she
said
as
she
gave
merriam
her
hand
good
heavens
he
said
with
a
twinge
of
the
stage
fright
which
he
had
thus
far
had
no
time
to
feel
i
shouldn
t
mind
the
others
but
you
he
left
that
dangerous
remark
unfinished
to
aunt
mary
he
said
i
ve
learned
the
speech
by
heart
i
admire
it
very
much
and
was
pleased
to
note
that
even
aunt
mary
had
an
author
s
susceptibility
to
praise
meanwhile
simpson
who
was
in
attendance
had
poured
out
a
cup
of
coffee
and
mollie
june
brought
it
to
him
with
a
sandwich
on
a
plate
won
t
you
sit
down
to
eat
it
she
asked
regarding
him
with
a
look
of
awe
which
flattered
him
enormously
and
served
to
quiet
his
rising
nervousness
mollie
june
had
taken
oratory
of
all
degrees
and
on
all
possible
occasions
on
the
part
of
norman
as
a
matter
of
course
but
the
thought
that
john
merriam
who
was
only
a
little
older
than
herself
and
had
taken
her
to
sociables
and
had
wanted
to
make
love
to
her
but
had
not
dared
was
about
to
address
the
distinguished
urban
club
of
chicago
at
one
of
its
formidable
luncheons
filled
her
with
admiration
thank
you
he
said
taking
the
coffee
and
the
sandwich
no
i
think
i
ll
eat
it
standing
but
he
smiled
at
her
with
the
confidence
which
her
admiration
had
given
him
thereby
increasing
the
admiration
a
pleasing
psychological
circle
but
now
rockwell
was
at
his
side
and
barely
gave
him
time
to
finish
his
sandwich
and
gulp
down
the
coffee
miss
norman
and
the
senator
and
i
go
with
mayor
black
in
the
senator
s
car
said
that
master
of
ceremonies
and
conspiracies
the
other
four
of
you
are
to
follow
in
the
mayor
s
machine
here
s
your
coat
and
hat
along
the
hall
down
in
the
elevator
through
the
lobby
to
the
pavement
merriam
had
only
a
dazed
sense
of
being
part
of
an
irresistible
conspicuous
procession
which
was
carrying
him
whither
he
had
no
strong
desire
to
go
a
limousine
was
already
drawn
up
at
the
curb
and
the
hotel
starter
was
deferentially
holding
the
door
mayor
black
was
already
within
the
car
ah
senator
the
mayor
ejaculated
i
m
glad
to
see
you
up
again
and
to
have
you
really
you
coming
to
the
reform
league
for
an
instant
merriam
did
not
understand
then
he
realised
that
the
mayor
thought
he
was
addressing
the
real
senator
norman
it
was
a
good
omen
for
the
continued
success
of
his
impersonation
he
sank
into
the
seat
opposite
the
mayor
who
was
facing
forward
with
aunt
mary
beside
him
rockwell
climbed
in
and
sat
next
to
merriam
the
door
slammed
and
the
machine
started
then
as
the
mayor
still
beamed
at
him
and
as
neither
of
the
others
spoke
merriam
said
gently
i
m
still
the
impostor
i
m
afraid
mr
mayor
eh
the
mayor
leaned
forward
to
scrutinise
his
face
and
then
turned
as
if
bewildered
and
still
unconvinced
to
rockwell
yes
said
rockwell
i
tried
to
get
you
on
the
phone
this
morning
but
your
line
was
busy
and
i
didn
t
have
a
chance
to
try
again
the
senator
is
still
sick
worse
in
fact
merriam
is
going
to
keep
the
senator
s
engagement
at
the
urban
club
for
him
my
god
cried
the
mayor
speak
before
all
those
people
you
never
can
do
it
yes
we
can
said
rockwell
with
smiling
serenity
you
were
fooled
again
yourself
just
now
he
pointed
out
the
mayor
groaned
then
we
still
don
t
know
where
senator
norman
himself
will
stand
when
he
s
up
he
said
i
telephoned
you
yesterday
that
he
had
agreed
to
everything
said
aunt
mary
coldly
that
was
true
while
he
was
sick
said
black
will
he
stick
to
it
when
he
s
well
again
he
ll
have
to
stick
said
rockwell
ten
times
more
so
after
this
speech
he
can
t
possibly
go
back
on
that
if
this
merriam
said
the
mayor
eyeing
him
with
profound
dislike
is
unmasked
at
the
urban
club
it
would
be
the
utter
ruin
of
us
all
it
undoubtedly
would
replied
rockwell
cheerfully
all
the
more
reason
why
we
should
all
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
and
play
up
for
him
no
cried
the
mayor
it
s
insane
stop
the
car
i
ll
step
into
the
nearest
store
and
telephone
that
the
senator
has
fainted
in
the
cab
and
can
t
appear
anything
is
better
than
this
awful
risk
he
put
out
his
hand
for
the
cord
to
signal
to
the
chauffeur
but
rockwell
roughly
struck
his
arm
down
sit
still
he
commanded
savagely
do
you
want
us
to
choke
you
again
this
car
goes
on
to
the
urban
club
senator
norman
has
a
fine
speech
and
he
ll
make
it
well
no
one
will
suspect
the
thing
has
the
one
essential
characteristic
of
successful
imposture
boldness
to
the
point
of
impossibility
if
any
one
notices
any
slight
change
in
his
appearance
or
voice
or
manner
it
will
be
put
down
to
his
illness
it
will
cinch
the
whole
thing
as
nothing
else
could
you
ve
got
to
go
through
with
it
mayor
black
groaned
again
and
relapsed
into
a
dismal
silence
fortunately
he
did
not
have
long
to
brood
nor
merriam
long
to
work
up
the
nervousness
which
this
dialogue
had
naturally
renewed
in
him
in
a
couple
of
minutes
after
the
mayor
s
second
and
more
lamentable
groan
the
limousine
stopped
before
the
imposing
entrance
of
the
urban
club
sit
tight
mayor
rockwell
warned
then
the
doorman
of
the
club
opened
the
car
and
rockwell
descended
and
helped
aunt
mary
out
and
merriam
and
the
mayor
followed
inside
their
coats
and
the
men
s
hats
were
quickly
taken
from
them
by
efficient
checkroom
boys
and
they
were
guided
immediately
to
the
elevator
the
speeches
had
already
begun
upstairs
some
one
said
they
stepped
out
into
the
hallway
outside
the
club
s
big
dining
room
from
inside
came
the
noise
of
clapping
some
one
had
just
finished
speaking
this
is
our
chance
said
rockwell
meaning
doubtless
that
they
could
best
enter
during
the
interlude
between
speeches
go
ahead
senator
take
the
mayor
s
arm
in
a
moment
they
were
passing
through
a
group
of
tuxedoed
servants
at
the
door
merriam
was
conscious
of
a
large
room
in
pleasant
tones
of
brown
with
a
low
raftered
ceiling
and
many
windows
of
small
leaded
panes
the
tables
were
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
great
horseshoe
with
the
closed
end
the
speakers
table
opposite
the
door
the
horseshoe
was
lined
inside
and
out
with
guests
perhaps
two
hundred
in
all
men
who
looked
either
distinguished
or
intelligent
occasionally
both
and
women
who
were
either
distinguished
or
intelligent
or
beautiful
from
some
points
of
view
the
great
city
s
best
then
came
the
turning
of
many
eyes
to
look
at
himself
and
mayor
black
and
the
toastmaster
at
the
center
of
the
speakers
table
rose
and
called
to
them
senator
mayor
this
way
he
pointed
to
two
empty
chairs
on
either
side
of
his
own
merriam
nodded
and
still
propelling
the
black
circled
one
side
of
the
horseshoe
giving
the
line
of
guests
as
wide
a
berth
as
he
could
to
avoid
possible
contretemps
from
personal
greetings
to
which
he
might
be
unable
to
make
suitable
response
arrived
at
the
speakers
table
he
shook
hands
warmly
with
the
toastmaster
a
bald
man
of
much
aplomb
whose
name
he
never
learned
and
with
two
or
three
other
men
from
nearby
chairs
evidently
personal
acquaintances
of
senator
norman
s
who
rose
to
welcome
him
making
talk
the
while
of
apologies
for
being
late
presently
he
found
himself
seated
at
the
toastmaster
s
right
facing
the
distinguished
company
no
one
had
betrayed
any
suspicion
the
imposture
was
in
fact
as
rockwell
had
said
so
bold
as
to
be
unthinkable
mayor
black
had
meanwhile
been
seated
at
the
toastmaster
s
left
and
rockwell
and
aunt
mary
had
been
guided
to
two
vacant
seats
at
the
left
end
of
the
speakers
table
the
necessity
of
greeting
friends
had
somewhat
roused
the
mayor
who
had
found
his
tongue
and
managed
to
respond
though
for
him
haltingly
the
toastmaster
leaned
towards
merriam
and
whispered
you
re
to
speak
last
senator
colonel
edwards
is
next
then
mayor
black
then
you
with
that
he
rose
and
felicitated
the
company
on
the
arrival
of
the
two
distinguished
servants
of
the
city
and
the
nation
between
whom
he
now
had
the
honour
to
sit
he
then
introduced
colonel
edwards
a
stout
quite
gentleman
who
was
earnestly
interested
and
mildly
interesting
on
the
subject
of
good
roads
for
the
space
of
fifteen
minutes
merriam
s
attention
was
distracted
almost
at
the
beginning
of
colonel
edwards
speech
by
the
arrival
at
the
entrance
of
the
dining
room
now
directly
opposite
him
of
the
second
from
the
hotel
alicia
caught
merriam
s
eye
and
smiled
at
him
mischievously
evidently
she
was
enjoying
the
situation
to
the
full
mollie
june
on
the
other
hand
though
deliciously
crowned
with
a
small
blossomy
hat
of
obvious
expensiveness
was
entirely
grave
her
eyes
fixed
almost
too
steadily
and
too
anxiously
on
our
youthful
hero
where
he
sat
in
the
seats
of
the
mighty
outwardly
at
least
as
much
at
ease
as
if
he
had
been
accustomed
for
thirty
years
to
find
himself
at
the
speakers
table
of
historic
clubs
colonel
edwards
suddenly
sat
down
he
was
one
of
those
rare
public
speakers
who
occasionally
disconcert
their
audiences
by
stopping
when
they
are
through
the
toastmaster
gasped
but
rose
to
his
feet
and
the
occasion
and
called
upon
mayor
black
as
the
mayor
slowly
rose
merriam
was
most
uncomfortably
anxious
uncertain
whether
the
city
s
chief
executive
was
even
yet
sufficiently
master
of
himself
to
face
an
audience
successfully
but
black
was
one
of
those
gentlemen
not
uncommon
in
public
life
who
are
apparently
more
at
ease
before
an
audience
than
in
any
other
situation
his
great
mellow
voice
boomed
forth
and
merriam
relaxed
that
speech
was
hardly
perhaps
one
of
the
mayor
s
masterpieces
but
that
mattered
little
of
course
he
produced
an
admirably
even
flow
of
head
tones
it
like
a
perfectly
good
speech
merriam
at
any
rate
was
quite
oblivious
of
any
lack
of
strict
logical
coherence
in
the
mayor
s
remarks
he
was
suddenly
smitten
by
the
realisation
that
his
own
turn
came
next
for
a
moment
he
fought
a
panic
of
blankness
then
mentally
grabbed
at
the
opening
sentences
of
what
he
had
so
carefully
committed
during
the
morning
outwardly
serene
and
attentive
to
the
speaker
inwardly
he
hastily
rehearsed
his
first
half
dozen
paragraphs
and
winking
his
eyes
somewhat
rapidly
perhaps
fixed
the
outline
of
the
rest
of
it
in
his
mind
the
mayor
rose
to
a
climax
of
thunderous
tone
and
eloquent
gesture
and
sat
loud
applause
followed
across
the
clapping
hands
merriam
glanced
at
wayward
and
alicia
and
mollie
june
where
they
sat
at
one
side
of
the
horseshoe
the
other
two
were
clapping
but
mollie
june
was
not
he
thought
she
looked
pale
but
of
course
he
was
too
far
away
to
be
sure
she
is
afraid
for
me
he
thought
and
gratitude
for
her
interest
mingled
with
a
fine
resolve
to
show
her
that
she
had
no
cause
for
fear
that
he
would
give
a
good
account
of
himself
anywhere
for
her
the
glow
of
that
resolution
carried
him
through
the
ordeal
of
the
toastmaster
s
introduction
and
brought
him
to
his
feet
with
smiling
alacrity
at
the
proper
moment
the
applause
was
hearty
there
is
magic
still
strange
as
it
may
seem
in
the
word
senator
he
was
forced
to
bow
again
and
again
then
he
struck
into
his
speech
aunt
mary
s
speech
he
found
himself
he
had
at
least
half
his
mind
free
to
attend
to
his
delivery
he
gave
it
slowly
impressively
grandly
facing
first
one
part
of
his
audience
and
then
another
george
norman
himself
before
packed
galleries
in
the
senate
chamber
at
washington
had
never
done
better
and
it
was
a
good
speech
deftly
conceived
clearly
reasoned
aptly
worded
merriam
himself
in
all
his
morning
s
study
of
it
had
not
realised
how
perfectly
it
was
adapted
to
the
occasion
and
the
audience
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
speakers
table
the
female
author
of
it
sat
unnoticed
watching
with
lips
its
effect
her
only
right
to
be
there
if
any
one
had
asked
you
the
accident
of
her
relationship
to
the
wonderful
senator
he
reached
the
end
as
he
rounded
out
the
last
sentence
his
eyes
rested
triumphantly
for
a
second
on
mollie
june
whether
or
not
her
cheeks
had
been
pale
before
they
were
flushed
now
he
sat
down
the
room
rocked
the
applause
this
time
was
no
mechanical
reaction
it
was
an
ovation
the
toastmaster
leaped
to
his
feet
with
ponderous
agility
and
grabbed
for
merriam
s
hand
the
latter
found
himself
standing
the
center
of
a
group
of
excited
men
all
of
whom
he
must
pretend
to
know
overwhelming
him
with
congratulations
behind
him
he
caught
a
remark
that
was
doubtless
not
intended
for
his
ears
how
the
devil
does
he
keep
his
youthful
looks
and
fire
he
might
be
then
rockwell
charged
into
the
group
excited
himself
but
persistent
with
the
formula
pressing
engagement
and
got
him
out
of
the
room
and
into
the
elevator
and
through
the
hallway
on
the
first
floor
with
his
hat
and
coat
restored
and
into
the
limousine
which
darted
away
for
the
hotel
council
of
merriam
and
rockwell
were
alone
in
the
senator
s
car
merriam
leaned
back
against
the
cushions
and
closed
his
eyes
he
was
at
once
fatigued
and
excited
it
almost
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
still
addressing
the
urban
club
then
he
seemed
to
be
talking
still
but
to
a
single
auditor
a
girl
with
flushed
cheeks
and
eyes
that
shone
with
excited
pride
he
opened
his
eyes
rockwell
was
regarding
him
steadily
i
don
t
wonder
you
feel
done
up
he
said
it
was
splendid
my
boy
you
spoke
like
a
veteran
you
ought
to
go
into
public
life
on
your
own
perhaps
you
will
he
seemed
to
meditate
then
you
saw
crockett
i
suppose
no
exclaimed
merriam
didn
t
you
he
was
seated
six
places
to
your
right
at
the
speakers
table
right
in
line
with
you
of
course
not
strange
you
missed
him
just
as
well
perhaps
it
might
have
shaken
even
nerve
the
phrase
even
nerve
was
pleasant
praise
to
merriam
he
had
never
thought
of
himself
as
possessed
of
any
exceptional
but
perhaps
he
had
behaved
with
rather
creditable
composure
in
a
trying
situation
was
shaken
i
can
tell
you
rockwell
was
saying
lord
i
was
on
pins
i
didn
t
know
but
what
when
you
rose
to
speak
he
would
jump
up
and
denounce
you
but
not
he
he
simply
lay
back
and
stared
and
kept
moistening
his
lips
i
suppose
he
couldn
t
make
up
his
mind
for
sure
whether
you
were
the
senator
or
the
double
or
whether
he
himself
had
gone
crazy
or
not
we
ll
hear
from
him
though
he
added
reflectively
i
suppose
so
said
merriam
wearily
i
wish
to
heaven
we
were
clean
through
the
thing
that
feeling
had
come
suddenly
and
for
the
moment
he
meant
it
though
he
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
so
do
i
said
rockwell
heartily
but
we
re
not
not
by
a
long
shot
so
you
must
buck
up
here
s
the
hotel
you
shall
have
a
real
meal
now
that
ll
put
heart
into
you
again
the
machine
stopped
and
the
door
was
opened
quick
time
now
rockwell
whispered
senator
norman
and
his
new
political
manager
rockwell
of
the
reform
league
rushed
almost
precipitately
into
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
de
soto
and
made
a
bee
line
for
the
nearest
elevator
it
was
obvious
that
important
business
urgently
called
them
for
they
merely
nodded
hurriedly
in
response
to
several
cordial
salutations
as
the
elevator
shot
up
rockwell
leaned
heavily
against
the
side
of
the
car
took
off
his
hat
though
there
was
no
one
with
them
drew
a
deep
breath
and
comically
winked
both
eyes
at
merriam
what
a
life
he
ejaculated
stepping
out
at
floor
three
they
were
greeted
by
the
spectacle
of
hobart
bending
over
the
floor
clerk
s
desk
and
evidently
having
a
delightful
with
the
handsome
young
mistress
of
that
sanctum
whose
eyes
were
coquettishly
raised
to
his
though
her
head
was
slightly
bent
for
she
was
smelling
an
american
beauty
rose
a
large
vase
of
the
same
expensive
flowers
adorned
one
corner
of
her
desk
only
a
momentary
glimpse
did
merriam
and
rockwell
have
of
this
pretty
tableau
for
hobart
at
once
straightened
up
as
if
in
some
embarrassment
and
came
towards
them
i
was
just
thinking
it
was
about
time
for
you
to
be
back
he
said
though
he
surely
did
not
expect
them
to
believe
that
he
had
just
been
thinking
anything
of
the
sort
the
pretty
floor
clerk
no
whit
nonplused
bowed
and
smiled
at
rockwell
but
she
studiously
failed
to
observe
senator
norman
s
presence
hobart
walked
down
the
hall
with
them
how
s
norman
rockwell
asked
no
better
i
m
afraid
said
the
physician
apologetically
he
has
a
high
fever
and
a
while
ago
he
was
slightly
delirious
i
had
to
give
him
more
of
the
drug
he
s
sleeping
again
now
simpson
is
with
him
of
course
damn
said
rockwell
with
a
sort
of
deliberate
earnestness
they
reached
the
sitting
room
and
entered
it
there
was
no
one
there
simpson
was
apparently
in
the
senator
s
bedroom
merriam
dropped
into
a
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
again
rockwell
walked
across
to
a
window
and
stood
staring
out
hobart
stopped
uncertainly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
fiddled
with
a
cigarette
without
being
able
to
make
up
his
mind
to
light
it
for
several
moments
none
of
them
spoke
but
rockwell
was
not
the
man
to
remain
long
in
any
apathy
of
inaction
he
turned
suddenly
and
merriam
whom
the
prolonged
unnatural
silence
had
caused
to
open
his
eyes
saw
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
something
hobart
he
said
i
suppose
simpson
isn
t
practically
necessary
in
there
he
indicated
the
sick
room
said
hobart
i
suppose
not
he
s
just
watching
norman
will
sleep
soundly
for
some
time
then
ask
him
to
come
here
will
you
the
physician
disappeared
into
the
bedroom
and
in
a
moment
returned
with
simpson
simpson
said
rockwell
we
re
going
to
have
a
meal
here
for
nine
people
a
luncheon
if
you
like
but
make
it
hearty
choose
the
stuff
yourself
and
serve
it
as
quickly
as
you
can
please
for
a
moment
simpson
stared
then
as
if
remembering
a
nearly
forgotten
cue
he
replied
submissively
yes
sir
and
turned
to
the
door
as
that
door
closed
behind
simpson
merriam
suddenly
stood
up
i
must
send
a
telegram
to
riceville
he
said
starting
for
the
writing
table
for
a
blank
wait
a
bit
said
rockwell
you
can
send
it
just
as
well
an
hour
from
now
merriam
was
disposed
to
argue
but
just
then
the
rest
of
their
party
trooped
in
having
returned
to
the
hotel
in
mayor
black
s
car
alicia
walked
straight
up
to
merriam
gay
with
enthusiasm
caught
his
hand
and
squeezed
it
my
dear
boy
she
cried
it
was
perfectly
splendid
i
ve
half
a
mind
to
kiss
you
please
do
said
merriam
i
will
said
alicia
promptly
and
before
the
young
man
could
realise
what
was
happening
she
had
put
her
gloved
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
kissed
him
on
one
cheek
merriam
was
vastly
astonished
in
the
circles
in
which
he
had
moved
in
riceville
or
even
at
college
his
remark
could
have
been
taken
only
as
a
daring
pleasantry
but
he
undoubtedly
had
for
he
concealed
his
confusion
or
most
of
it
and
said
let
me
turn
the
other
cheek
oh
i
mustn
t
be
a
pig
said
alicia
i
ll
leave
the
other
cheek
for
mollie
june
at
this
merriam
s
confusion
became
i
fear
perfectly
apparent
for
the
remainder
of
the
party
had
followed
alicia
into
the
room
and
were
grouped
about
him
kiss
him
quick
mollie
dear
said
the
incorrigible
alicia
thereby
causing
confusion
in
a
second
person
present
but
mayor
black
no
longer
to
be
restrained
saved
the
situation
he
seized
merriam
s
hand
and
pumped
it
one
of
the
best
speeches
i
ever
heard
the
senator
make
he
asserted
in
tones
which
merriam
feared
might
rouse
the
real
senator
in
the
adjoining
room
wayward
meanwhile
was
patting
him
on
the
back
and
murmuring
fine
excellent
merriam
turned
to
aunt
mary
i
tried
to
do
it
justice
he
said
you
gave
it
exceedingly
well
said
aunt
mary
with
less
reserve
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
exhibit
before
indeed
you
did
cried
mollie
june
earnestly
her
eyes
shining
with
sincerity
and
that
tribute
from
the
least
qualified
judge
of
them
all
was
i
regret
to
state
the
one
which
young
merriam
treasured
the
most
simpson
who
had
worked
with
amazing
alacrity
and
even
inspired
his
assistants
to
celerity
had
completed
his
preparations
and
announced
that
he
was
ready
to
serve
the
luncheon
rockwell
delayed
the
meal
for
several
minutes
the
sake
of
an
apparently
important
conference
into
which
he
had
drawn
wayward
and
the
mayor
over
by
the
window
presently
however
they
all
sat
down
with
merriam
beside
mollie
june
the
luncheon
passed
as
luncheons
do
in
small
talk
and
anecdote
at
last
rockwell
having
finished
the
last
morsel
of
a
piece
of
french
pastry
laid
down
his
fork
and
fixed
his
eyes
significantly
on
wayward
who
was
in
with
something
like
his
fifteenth
anecdote
wayward
faltered
but
rallied
and
finished
his
story
it
was
the
best
one
he
had
told
but
there
was
only
perfunctory
laughter
every
one
about
the
table
was
looking
at
rockwell
realising
that
at
last
the
great
question
that
was
in
all
their
minds
what
are
we
to
do
next
was
to
be
discussed
and
decided
simpson
it
should
be
added
had
dismissed
his
assistants
as
soon
as
the
dessert
course
was
served
so
that
only
the
initiated
were
present
three
times
during
the
meal
hobart
had
left
the
table
to
enter
the
sick
room
on
the
second
occasion
he
had
remained
away
some
minutes
rockwell
now
turned
to
him
give
us
your
report
doctor
he
said
abruptly
well
replied
the
physician
he
is
better
half
an
hour
ago
he
was
awake
for
perhaps
five
minutes
his
temperature
is
lower
though
he
still
has
some
fever
he
is
sleeping
again
now
more
quietly
than
at
any
time
since
he
returned
to
the
hotel
in
short
he
is
doing
as
well
as
could
be
expected
but
it
is
out
of
the
question
for
him
to
start
on
that
tour
this
evening
undoubtedly
said
aunt
mary
with
much
decision
just
so
said
rockwell
that
being
the
case
two
alternatives
present
themselves
to
announce
his
illness
and
call
off
the
trip
or
to
go
on
playing
the
game
as
we
have
begun
with
merriam
s
help
merriam
gasped
and
opened
his
mouth
to
protest
but
rockwell
waved
him
down
the
mayor
and
wayward
and
i
have
been
discussing
the
matter
at
first
blush
there
may
seem
to
be
little
question
as
to
which
of
these
two
courses
we
should
pursue
having
come
safely
so
far
as
we
know
at
least
through
all
the
perils
of
discovery
thus
far
it
may
seem
that
we
should
tempt
fortune
no
further
but
let
merriam
return
to
his
school
publish
the
fact
of
the
senator
s
illness
and
cancel
the
speaking
engagements
surely
yes
interjected
merriam
and
aunt
mary
and
father
murray
and
mollie
june
and
even
alicia
seemed
to
assent
on
further
consideration
rockwell
continued
imperturbably
i
think
you
will
all
see
that
the
thing
is
not
so
clear
the
course
i
have
just
suggested
may
be
doubtless
is
the
more
prudent
one
if
prudence
were
all
but
it
is
decidedly
unfair
to
george
norman
at
this
aunt
mary
almost
visibly
pricked
up
her
ears
in
his
name
rockwell
went
on
we
have
thrown
over
the
conservative
wing
of
the
party
with
whom
he
has
always
stood
and
who
have
supported
him
have
betrayed
them
as
they
will
put
it
in
this
traction
matter
and
in
aligning
him
with
the
reform
league
we
did
so
on
the
theory
that
he
was
to
appeal
to
the
people
and
to
come
back
stronger
than
ever
as
the
leader
of
the
new
and
growing
progressive
element
which
is
sure
to
be
dominant
in
the
next
election
if
only
they
can
find
such
a
leader
as
norman
could
be
but
if
we
cancel
this
trip
and
let
him
drop
out
of
the
campaign
if
we
stop
now
where
will
he
be
he
will
have
lost
his
old
backers
and
will
not
have
made
new
ones
he
will
be
politically
dead
we
shall
have
played
absolutely
into
the
hands
of
crockett
and
thompson
and
the
rest
of
the
gang
and
shall
have
accomplished
nothing
but
the
political
ruin
of
george
norman
all
the
persons
about
the
table
except
mayor
black
and
wayward
stared
hard
at
rockwell
as
this
new
view
of
their
predicament
sank
into
their
minds
the
mayor
and
wayward
smiled
and
nodded
and
watched
the
effect
on
the
others
particularly
they
watched
merriam
who
sat
dumfounded
and
vaguely
alarmed
what
new
entanglements
was
rockwell
devising
for
him
he
must
get
back
to
riceville
involuntarily
he
could
not
have
said
why
he
cast
a
quick
glance
at
mollie
june
and
encountered
a
similar
glance
from
her
they
both
looked
away
in
confusion
aunt
mary
spoke
tell
us
your
plan
it
was
like
her
that
masterful
acceptance
without
comment
of
the
situation
my
plan
as
you
call
it
said
rockwell
fixing
his
eyes
not
on
aunt
mary
but
on
merriam
is
simply
that
we
should
go
on
for
another
day
or
two
as
we
have
begun
play
the
game
for
george
until
he
can
take
the
cards
in
his
own
hands
this
is
thursday
he
is
scheduled
to
leave
this
evening
for
cairo
to
speak
there
at
nine
o
clock
morning
to
go
on
to
east
louis
for
a
talk
before
the
rotary
club
at
noon
and
then
up
to
springfield
for
an
address
in
the
evening
is
that
correct
yes
said
aunt
mary
and
he
was
to
speak
in
bloomington
and
peoria
on
saturday
and
in
moline
and
freeport
on
sunday
the
speeches
are
all
ready
i
believe
yes
george
and
i
outlined
them
together
some
time
ago
and
i
have
them
written
and
typed
exactly
turn
the
manuscripts
over
to
merriam
as
you
did
this
morning
he
will
have
time
on
the
train
on
the
way
to
each
place
to
master
the
speech
to
be
given
at
that
point
we
shall
take
a
special
car
wayward
and
i
will
go
with
him
you
he
was
addressing
aunt
mary
and
the
mayor
and
hobart
and
simpson
he
added
glancing
up
at
the
waiter
who
stood
listening
in
the
background
and
the
rest
of
you
will
stay
here
to
guard
george
that
will
be
easy
when
the
newspapers
are
full
of
his
speeches
out
in
the
state
crockett
will
know
said
father
murray
timidly
he
may
suspect
said
rockwell
with
a
grin
but
if
you
keep
every
one
away
from
george
conceal
his
presence
here
he
can
t
be
sure
whether
it
s
george
himself
or
his
double
who
is
over
the
state
and
if
he
were
sure
he
wouldn
t
dare
denounce
him
thanks
to
merriam
s
clever
trick
last
night
he
has
a
particularly
strong
reason
for
keeping
his
mouth
shut
if
on
the
other
hand
we
give
up
and
lie
down
cancel
the
trip
he
can
easily
start
all
manner
of
nasty
stories
about
his
escapades
i
m
sorry
to
say
it
but
george
has
a
pretty
widespread
sporting
reputation
rockwell
glanced
apologetically
at
mollie
june
but
continued
when
a
man
with
such
a
character
is
laid
up
people
are
ready
to
believe
anything
except
that
he
is
really
legitimately
sick
things
will
be
safer
here
than
they
would
be
if
we
abandoned
our
trick
and
our
part
out
in
the
state
will
be
nuts
compared
to
what
it
was
at
the
urban
club
this
noon
for
instance
very
few
people
out
there
know
norman
well
there
is
no
question
at
all
that
merriam
will
get
by
and
we
know
from
this
noon
that
he
will
make
the
speeches
in
fine
shape
the
speeches
will
need
to
be
altered
a
bit
said
aunt
mary
if
they
are
to
appeal
to
the
progressives
merriam
can
attend
to
that
on
the
train
said
rockwell
soften
the
standpattism
and
throw
in
some
progressive
dope
can
t
you
he
appealed
to
merriam
i
suppose
i
could
said
merriam
but
my
school
i
know
said
rockwell
but
it
will
be
only
a
day
or
two
longer
we
ll
telegraph
again
of
course
if
you
were
really
sick
as
we
ve
been
telling
them
they
d
have
to
get
along
wouldn
t
they
you
ve
got
to
see
us
through
we
must
keep
the
ball
rolling
it
will
probably
be
only
one
more
day
george
will
be
able
to
travel
i
presume
he
asked
of
hobart
by
noon
anyway
by
noon
i
hope
said
the
physician
with
cheerful
optimism
you
see
said
rockwell
george
can
catch
the
noon
train
for
springfield
and
get
there
in
time
to
take
on
the
evening
speech
merriam
will
have
made
the
two
at
cairo
and
east
louis
he
can
go
back
to
riceville
from
springfield
just
then
the
telephone
rang
and
i
believe
every
person
in
the
room
jumped
rockwell
rose
to
answer
it
senator
norman
yes
he
is
here
but
he
is
engaged
this
is
rockwell
his
manager
you
can
give
the
message
to
me
a
moment
later
he
put
his
hand
over
the
receiver
and
turned
to
merriam
he
insists
on
speaking
to
the
senator
you
ll
have
to
answer
i
think
it
s
crockett
for
heaven
s
sake
be
careful
merriam
took
the
receiver
hello
a
voice
which
he
remembered
only
too
well
from
the
night
before
at
jennie
s
replied
this
is
crockett
i
have
the
honour
i
believe
of
speaking
to
mr
merriam
you
have
the
wrong
number
said
merriam
and
hung
up
but
before
he
had
had
time
to
explain
to
the
others
or
even
to
wonder
whether
he
had
done
wisely
the
bell
jangled
again
he
turned
back
to
the
instrument
rockwell
came
quickly
to
his
side
and
merriam
taking
down
the
receiver
held
it
so
that
his
manager
too
should
be
able
to
hear
what
came
over
the
wire
hello
ah
senator
norman
by
your
voice
said
crockett
in
tones
of
elaborate
irony
i
wish
to
congratulate
you
senator
on
your
speech
this
noon
it
was
a
magnificent
effort
so
full
of
progressive
ideas
and
youthful
virility
thank
you
said
merriam
and
senator
i
really
must
see
you
right
away
i
am
calling
from
the
lobby
i
will
come
up
to
your
rooms
at
once
if
i
may
or
meet
you
anywhere
else
you
say
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
you
mer
he
pretended
to
correct
himself
to
you
senator
as
well
as
to
me
wait
a
minute
said
merriam
he
put
his
hand
over
the
mouthpiece
and
looked
at
rockwell
tell
him
you
will
see
him
at
eight
o
clock
this
evening
here
merriam
repeated
this
message
at
said
crockett
with
significant
emphasis
on
the
hour
very
good
senator
thank
you
he
hung
up
rockwell
and
merriam
turned
to
the
others
aunt
mary
and
the
rest
had
risen
they
were
standing
by
their
places
about
the
table
looking
rather
scared
o
clock
questioned
aunt
mary
with
an
emphasis
similar
to
crockett
s
yes
said
rockwell
doggedly
because
he
addressed
merriam
your
train
goes
at
seven
at
miss
norman
shall
telephone
crockett
expressing
your
regret
that
you
overlooked
the
fact
that
you
would
have
to
be
gone
by
that
time
man
alive
he
cried
don
t
you
see
the
senator
can
t
be
sick
now
after
your
public
appearance
this
noon
half
the
people
who
count
in
chicago
saw
you
him
there
right
as
a
trivet
obviously
perfectly
well
and
we
can
t
keep
here
with
crockett
and
thompson
continually
nosing
round
there
s
nothing
for
it
but
for
you
to
start
on
that
trip
the
trip
s
a
godsend
write
your
telegram
to
riceville
merriam
glanced
around
the
circle
of
faces
mad
as
the
thing
was
they
all
seemed
to
agree
with
rockwell
mayor
black
and
wayward
and
even
simpson
seemed
to
be
asking
him
as
man
to
man
to
stand
by
them
father
murray
was
timidly
expectant
hobart
he
noticed
was
staring
down
at
the
table
as
if
in
thought
aunt
mary
looking
him
full
in
the
eyes
gave
an
affirmative
nod
alicia
s
eyes
and
shoulders
registered
appeal
as
conspicuously
as
if
she
had
been
a
movie
actress
and
mollie
june
seemed
to
be
begging
him
not
to
desert
her
with
a
gesture
of
resignation
he
went
over
to
the
writing
table
and
sat
down
to
compose
his
third
mendacious
telegram
to
riceville
business
of
being
an
the
writing
of
that
telegram
occupied
merriam
for
several
minutes
he
was
distracted
by
scruples
he
did
not
like
lying
and
he
felt
truly
enough
that
he
was
cheating
his
employers
the
board
of
education
of
riceville
and
the
patrons
of
the
school
and
his
boys
and
girls
by
staying
away
from
the
work
he
was
paid
to
do
when
after
a
last
momentary
hesitation
he
wrote
his
name
and
looked
up
he
found
simpson
standing
by
him
ready
to
take
the
message
he
noticed
the
man
s
new
air
of
cheerfulness
but
he
had
no
time
to
reflect
on
this
phenomenon
for
the
party
was
breaking
up
there
were
four
of
them
left
merriam
and
rockwell
aunt
mary
and
mollie
june
well
said
rockwell
with
a
sigh
we
re
off
again
you
d
better
go
to
your
own
room
wilson
s
room
i
promised
the
reporters
to
see
them
at
half
past
four
and
it
s
nearly
that
now
you
ll
need
to
pack
take
these
speeches
with
you
i
ll
let
you
know
when
the
taxi
comes
in
a
moment
merriam
was
crossing
the
senator
s
room
involuntarily
he
cast
a
glance
at
the
sick
man
in
the
bed
in
a
small
chair
by
the
head
of
the
bed
mollie
june
was
sitting
her
eyes
on
her
husband
she
looked
up
as
merriam
traversed
the
room
met
his
gaze
soberly
for
an
instant
and
then
looked
back
at
norman
merriam
passed
through
the
door
on
the
other
side
into
his
own
room
he
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
set
the
portfolio
on
a
chair
and
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
the
tiny
connubial
tableau
of
which
he
had
just
had
a
glimpse
had
brought
home
to
him
as
nothing
before
had
done
the
fact
that
mollie
june
really
was
another
man
s
wife
the
acute
realisation
left
him
blank
he
crossed
over
sank
into
a
chair
by
the
window
and
stared
out
across
the
fire
escape
another
man
s
wife
and
he
loved
her
of
course
he
loved
her
just
as
he
had
always
done
and
she
loved
him
a
little
at
least
that
such
a
thing
should
happen
to
him
and
her
because
he
had
been
a
coward
three
years
ago
in
riceville
how
long
he
sat
dully
revolving
such
thoughts
as
these
he
had
no
idea
he
was
startled
by
the
opening
of
the
door
from
the
senator
s
bedroom
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
the
involuntary
thought
that
it
might
be
mollie
june
though
of
course
she
would
have
knocked
it
was
simpson
shall
i
pack
your
things
sir
why
yes
said
merriam
he
knew
from
novels
that
the
valet
of
the
hero
always
packs
his
bag
evidently
simpson
had
come
in
this
capacity
to
merriam
s
american
it
seemed
an
absurd
practice
why
shouldn
t
any
man
put
his
own
things
into
a
grip
for
himself
but
he
was
glad
of
company
you
can
help
he
added
and
took
a
couple
of
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
bureau
with
the
idea
of
taking
things
out
of
drawers
oh
don
t
bother
sir
said
simpson
quickly
in
his
tone
there
was
something
subtly
patronising
for
he
who
has
been
a
butler
and
a
waiter
and
a
valet
among
the
real
elite
feels
even
himself
to
be
socially
superior
to
the
unbutlered
and
unvaleted
simpson
said
merriam
suddenly
you
ve
seen
jennie
simpson
stopped
absolutely
still
for
a
moment
with
a
couple
of
folded
shirts
in
his
hands
then
he
placed
the
shirts
in
the
suit
case
straightened
up
and
looked
at
merriam
yes
he
hesitated
and
decided
to
use
the
real
name
yes
merriam
i
have
i
went
out
there
this
morning
as
you
suggested
she
let
you
in
yes
she
did
she
let
me
sit
down
on
the
sofa
with
her
and
we
had
a
long
talk
i
ended
by
asking
her
again
to
marry
me
and
she
said
she
would
and
she
kissed
you
merriam
cried
gaily
he
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
his
own
troubles
in
simpson
s
happiness
for
which
he
rightly
felt
he
might
claim
some
credit
and
in
an
appreciative
recollection
of
jennie
s
temperament
within
a
dozen
hours
she
had
also
kissed
crockett
and
himself
but
jennie
was
born
to
kiss
simpson
looked
quickly
at
the
younger
man
and
returned
to
his
packing
yes
he
said
she
did
merriam
regretted
his
exclamation
which
had
in
fact
told
too
much
for
several
minutes
he
watched
in
silence
the
deft
efficient
work
of
his
companion
then
he
asked
when
is
it
to
be
the
wedding
sir
yes
as
soon
as
you
and
rockwell
can
spare
me
sir
simpson
closed
the
hand
bag
closed
the
suit
case
and
strapped
it
is
there
anything
else
i
can
do
sir
i
believe
not
the
waiter
hesitated
then
he
decided
to
speak
what
was
in
his
heart
i
am
very
greatly
indebted
to
you
sir
he
said
with
an
admirable
combination
of
dignity
and
feeling
you
have
made
a
happy
man
of
a
very
wretched
one
and
have
saved
a
young
girl
who
was
on
a
very
wrong
track
if
ever
i
can
render
you
any
service
you
can
always
command
me
sir
merriam
sprang
up
and
advanced
holding
out
his
hand
i
m
tremendously
glad
he
said
i
have
accomplished
one
thing
anyway
with
all
this
miserable
imposture
simpson
shook
his
hand
heartily
then
shall
i
leave
you
now
sir
why
yes
please
said
merriam
he
was
loth
to
be
left
alone
but
there
was
clearly
nothing
more
to
be
said
between
him
and
simpson
in
a
moment
the
waiter
had
withdrawn
through
the
door
into
the
senator
s
bedroom
merriam
s
thoughts
followed
him
into
that
room
where
mollie
june
doubtless
still
sat
by
her
husband
s
bed
but
just
then
a
knock
sounded
at
the
hall
door
he
looked
up
startled
he
was
not
expecting
any
one
to
approach
from
that
direction
who
could
have
any
business
with
wilson
another
knock
merriam
hesitated
should
he
go
to
the
door
or
simply
sit
tight
till
the
knocker
became
convinced
that
there
was
no
one
within
and
went
away
he
decided
upon
the
latter
course
any
one
whom
he
ought
to
see
rockwell
would
bring
to
him
a
third
time
the
knock
sounded
discreet
but
persistent
then
suddenly
a
key
was
inserted
in
the
lock
and
turned
the
door
opened
and
in
stepped
crockett
merriam
sprang
to
his
feet
but
did
not
speak
thank
you
said
crockett
over
his
shoulder
to
whom
merriam
could
not
see
he
closed
the
door
and
advanced
is
it
mr
wilson
he
asked
ironically
or
merriam
or
senator
norman
is
it
crockett
the
financier
or
a
merriam
retorted
crockett
laughed
but
it
was
an
unpleasant
forced
laugh
since
you
do
not
answer
my
question
he
said
i
don
t
see
that
i
need
answer
yours
see
here
he
continued
with
a
change
of
tone
how
much
is
it
worth
to
you
to
turn
over
to
me
those
pictures
you
took
last
night
films
and
all
of
course
and
get
out
of
this
you
won
t
accomplish
anything
by
insulting
me
cried
merriam
a
flare
of
youthful
anger
somewhat
impairing
his
dignity
insulting
you
echoed
crockett
sneeringly
my
dear
sir
as
a
complete
impostor
you
can
hardly
expect
to
get
away
with
that
pose
i
ll
admit
you
re
good
at
it
that
impersonation
of
the
senator
before
the
urban
club
this
noon
was
a
masterpiece
but
what
s
the
game
does
rockwell
really
suppose
he
can
swing
senator
norman
over
permanently
to
the
reformers
let
me
tell
you
that
as
soon
as
the
real
norman
is
on
his
feet
again
thompson
and
i
and
the
rest
of
us
will
get
hold
of
him
and
bring
him
around
in
no
time
we
know
too
many
things
about
your
handsome
boy
senator
he
can
t
shake
us
now
so
what
s
the
use
unless
he
added
suddenly
the
plan
is
to
kill
him
off
and
substitute
you
permanently
hardly
so
desperate
as
that
said
merriam
smiling
the
other
man
s
long
speech
had
given
him
time
to
recover
himself
well
then
why
not
make
a
good
thing
out
of
it
for
yourself
and
get
away
while
you
can
it
isn
t
as
if
no
one
had
suspected
you
not
only
suspect
but
know
i
haven
t
told
any
one
else
yet
but
you
can
hardly
expect
me
to
keep
your
secret
indefinitely
you
forget
the
pictures
said
merriam
as
sweetly
as
he
could
crockett
obviously
mastered
a
damn
and
chased
the
expression
that
rose
to
accompany
it
from
his
face
let
s
keep
to
business
he
said
how
much
is
rockwell
paying
you
for
this
job
no
monetary
consideration
has
been
mentioned
between
us
said
merriam
it
was
the
truth
of
course
but
perhaps
he
need
not
have
been
so
stilted
about
it
you
surely
don
t
expect
me
to
believe
that
come
whatever
the
amount
is
i
ll
double
it
all
i
ask
of
you
is
first
to
hand
over
to
me
the
pictures
and
second
to
pick
up
your
bags
which
i
see
are
already
packed
and
walk
out
of
that
door
with
me
we
ll
step
across
the
street
to
my
bank
i
ll
pay
you
the
sum
in
cash
and
you
can
skidoo
no
exposure
is
involved
you
see
of
you
or
your
friends
i
m
not
revengeful
i
don
t
need
to
be
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
wait
until
i
can
get
hold
of
norman
in
the
meantime
you
get
clear
of
a
situation
that
otherwise
is
likely
to
prove
very
nasty
for
you
personally
and
very
nasty
likewise
for
your
reformer
associates
you
will
note
that
i
trust
to
your
honour
to
give
me
all
the
copies
of
the
pictures
and
not
to
sting
me
on
the
amount
i
am
to
pay
you
honour
among
thieves
queried
merriam
who
s
insulting
now
crockett
demanded
i
am
said
merriam
at
least
i
m
trying
my
best
to
be
crockett
you
spoke
of
walking
out
of
that
door
i
ll
thank
you
to
do
that
very
thing
at
once
if
you
don
t
i
ll
call
in
rockwell
and
we
ll
put
you
out
i
m
tempted
to
try
it
by
myself
but
i
don
t
care
to
risk
any
noisy
scuffling
prudent
young
man
sneered
crockett
retreating
nevertheless
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
door
i
understand
that
you
reject
my
offer
i
certainly
do
very
good
i
hereby
serve
notice
on
you
that
i
shall
immediately
expose
the
whole
of
your
atrocious
masquerade
it
will
be
the
ruin
of
you
and
rockwell
and
norman
and
mayor
black
and
every
other
person
who
has
been
mixed
up
in
it
oh
you
ll
be
a
nine
days
wonder
in
the
city
but
no
one
of
you
will
ever
have
a
scrap
of
public
credit
again
and
on
the
following
day
retorted
merriam
those
pretty
pictures
we
know
of
will
be
published
in
they
ll
be
running
sketches
called
a
financier
in
a
flat
in
every
music
hall
in
town
you
blackmailer
on
the
contrary
you
ve
tried
to
get
me
to
take
blackmail
and
i
ve
refused
it
with
a
sound
remarkably
like
the
snarling
bah
which
regularly
accompanies
the
retreat
of
the
foiled
villain
of
melodrama
crockett
turned
towards
the
door
through
which
he
had
been
invited
to
depart
but
in
the
course
of
the
three
or
four
steps
which
he
had
to
take
to
reach
that
exit
he
recovered
something
of
his
dignity
and
finesse
having
opened
the
door
he
turned
and
bowed
ironically
good
evening
senator
he
said
i
m
afraid
i
shall
be
prevented
from
keeping
my
appointment
with
you
at
eight
if
you
should
change
your
mind
within
the
next
half
hour
you
can
reach
me
by
phone
at
the
union
league
otherwise
look
out
on
this
warning
note
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
merriam
found
himself
with
a
whirling
brain
as
a
quiet
pedagogue
he
was
not
accustomed
to
scenes
of
battle
such
as
he
had
just
passed
through
he
walked
up
and
down
and
mechanically
lit
a
cigarette
as
he
did
so
his
mind
seized
upon
one
question
who
had
unlocked
the
door
for
crockett
some
chambermaid
or
bell
boy
or
the
floor
clerk
at
any
rate
it
must
have
been
done
with
her
connivance
and
by
her
authority
for
she
was
the
commanding
general
of
floor
three
why
had
she
done
or
permitted
this
outrageous
thing
suddenly
merriam
recalled
her
studied
ignoring
of
him
on
the
last
two
occasions
of
his
passing
her
desk
and
compared
it
with
her
whispered
the
violets
are
lovely
when
he
first
asked
for
senator
norman
s
key
there
had
been
something
between
her
and
norman
he
merriam
in
taking
on
the
senator
s
rôle
had
dropped
out
that
part
of
it
and
she
was
offended
how
seriously
he
could
not
tell
he
concluded
that
he
must
attempt
to
reinstate
himself
norman
in
the
pretty
floor
clerk
s
good
graces
and
rather
hastily
decided
upon
a
plan
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
asked
for
the
hotel
florist
how
much
were
violets
well
they
had
some
lovely
large
bunches
for
five
dollars
this
figure
rather
staggered
the
rural
pedagogue
but
he
promptly
asked
to
have
one
of
those
bunches
sent
up
at
once
to
wilson
giving
his
room
number
he
would
present
his
peace
offering
in
person
i
am
sure
these
flowers
will
look
lovely
on
your
desk
or
if
you
will
wear
them
at
your
waist
he
would
say
or
something
of
the
sort
this
was
probably
not
the
way
senator
norman
would
have
done
he
would
have
run
no
such
open
risk
but
we
must
make
allowances
for
merriam
s
inexperience
but
he
never
carried
out
his
plan
for
he
had
barely
left
the
telephone
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
light
knock
on
the
door
leading
into
the
senator
s
bedroom
this
time
he
was
sure
it
was
mollie
june
and
he
was
right
when
he
opened
the
door
she
stood
there
with
a
finger
at
her
lips
aunt
mary
has
taken
my
place
with
george
she
said
in
a
low
tone
she
says
i
may
give
you
some
tea
it
will
be
late
before
you
can
get
your
dinner
on
the
train
would
you
like
it
tremendously
said
merriam
sincerely
come
into
the
sitting
room
then
she
crossed
the
sick
room
to
the
door
at
the
other
side
which
led
to
the
sitting
room
and
he
followed
with
a
nod
to
aunt
mary
who
now
sat
by
the
sleeping
senator
s
bed
arrived
in
the
sitting
room
he
was
further
delighted
to
find
that
neither
rockwell
nor
simpson
was
present
it
was
to
be
a
genuine
by
one
of
the
windows
stood
a
small
table
with
the
tea
things
upon
it
the
kettle
already
singing
over
an
alcohol
flame
beside
the
table
stood
a
large
armchair
and
a
small
rocker
the
big
chair
is
for
you
said
mollie
june
seating
herself
in
the
rocker
and
adjusting
the
flame
thank
you
he
said
and
sat
then
a
mingling
of
pleasure
and
embarrassment
held
him
awkwardly
silent
mollie
june
was
apparently
quite
composed
george
is
ever
so
much
better
she
said
he
was
awake
a
few
minutes
ago
and
he
seemed
almost
well
he
has
only
a
very
little
fever
left
she
smiled
brightly
at
merriam
who
dimly
realised
that
it
was
to
the
fact
that
her
mind
was
now
at
ease
about
her
husband
that
he
owed
this
treat
mollie
june
set
a
brightly
flowered
cup
on
a
saucer
to
match
and
placed
a
small
spoon
beside
it
then
she
took
up
the
sugar
tongs
and
her
hand
hovered
over
the
bowl
one
lump
or
two
two
please
said
merriam
noting
the
slenderness
and
whiteness
of
the
fingers
that
held
the
tongs
and
the
pinkness
of
the
small
nails
why
else
except
to
display
charming
fingers
and
nails
were
sugar
tongs
invented
lemon
or
cream
merriam
was
sophisticated
enough
to
know
that
the
right
answer
was
lemon
but
he
preferred
cream
and
an
admirable
instinct
of
honesty
led
him
to
say
so
through
the
open
window
came
the
pleasant
air
of
the
spring
afternoon
the
street
without
being
an
street
was
flooded
with
sunlight
with
the
breeze
there
entered
also
the
stimulating
roar
of
the
city
s
lively
traffic
the
breeze
stirred
mollie
june
s
soft
wavy
hair
it
also
caused
the
alcohol
flame
under
the
brass
kettle
to
flutter
and
sputter
and
mollie
june
leaned
forward
to
regulate
it
the
youthful
firmness
of
her
cheeks
and
chin
showed
like
a
lovely
cameo
in
the
bright
light
which
would
have
been
unkind
to
an
older
face
having
adjusted
the
flame
she
suddenly
looked
up
at
merriam
and
smiled
mollie
june
he
cried
there
is
nothing
lovelier
in
the
world
than
your
eyes
when
you
look
up
and
smile
like
that
he
had
not
meant
to
say
anything
of
that
sort
but
it
was
forced
out
of
him
mollie
june
s
smile
lingered
and
the
cameo
became
faintly
charmingly
tinted
but
she
evidently
felt
that
some
rebuke
was
needed
mollie
june
you
must
remember
she
said
gently
then
taking
up
her
cup
and
leaning
back
in
her
small
rocker
she
asked
how
did
you
get
along
with
the
speeches
not
very
well
said
merriam
he
hesitated
in
his
mind
whether
to
tell
her
of
crockett
s
interruption
but
decided
not
to
it
would
take
too
long
he
could
not
waste
the
precious
minutes
so
i
ll
have
the
dickens
of
a
time
with
them
he
added
oh
no
you
won
t
she
cried
as
if
shocked
at
the
idea
you
were
wonderful
this
noon
i
was
so
proud
of
you
you
had
a
right
to
be
said
merriam
it
was
because
you
were
there
that
i
could
do
well
which
was
perhaps
partially
true
why
don
t
you
go
into
it
yourself
asked
mollie
june
public
life
perhaps
i
will
i
may
go
back
to
the
university
for
a
law
course
and
then
try
to
get
into
politics
this
plan
had
just
occurred
to
merriam
but
he
did
not
disclose
that
fact
in
uttering
one
s
inspirations
to
a
pretty
woman
one
usually
presents
them
as
though
they
were
the
fruit
of
mature
consideration
that
would
be
fine
said
mollie
june
without
much
enthusiasm
but
you
ll
be
at
riceville
next
year
i
suppose
so
i
ll
have
to
save
up
a
bit
more
i
may
be
at
home
for
christmas
she
said
i
ll
see
you
then
merriam
considered
this
painfully
no
he
said
at
last
slowly
i
shan
t
be
there
i
shall
be
away
for
the
holidays
you
could
stay
over
said
mollie
june
wonderingly
reproachful
i
suppose
i
could
but
i
mustn
t
just
to
see
you
publicly
is
too
hard
on
me
and
if
i
see
you
alone
like
this
i
say
things
i
oughtn
t
to
make
love
to
you
mollie
june
sat
drooping
with
downcast
eyes
her
cup
in
her
lap
suddenly
he
was
on
his
knees
beside
her
he
put
his
arms
about
her
to
the
great
peril
of
flowered
china
mollie
june
he
whispered
he
softly
kissed
her
cheek
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
deep
into
his
john
she
whispered
back
though
she
seemed
to
struggle
not
to
do
so
after
a
moment
he
smiled
sadly
and
got
to
his
feet
i
mustn
t
have
any
more
tea
he
said
as
if
that
beverage
was
too
intoxicating
as
indeed
under
the
circumstances
it
was
fortunately
since
of
all
things
what
they
needed
was
a
diversion
merriam
at
that
moment
became
conscious
of
a
portentous
knocking
on
a
distant
door
he
realised
that
it
was
on
the
door
to
wilson
s
room
and
remembered
the
flowers
for
the
floor
clerk
he
hurried
to
the
hall
and
called
the
boy
from
the
second
door
down
the
corridor
where
he
was
about
to
pound
again
in
a
moment
he
reëntered
the
room
bearing
a
lovely
great
bunch
of
fragrant
english
violets
and
thinking
hard
but
he
was
equal
to
the
emergency
he
advanced
to
mollie
june
who
stood
now
with
her
back
to
the
window
her
slender
form
outlined
against
the
light
her
face
in
shadow
i
ve
never
given
you
anything
mollie
june
he
said
these
are
for
you
and
the
sick
room
he
held
them
for
her
to
smell
she
took
them
from
him
barely
touching
his
hand
as
she
did
so
and
buried
her
face
in
them
for
a
long
minute
then
she
raised
her
eyes
to
him
over
them
thank
you
john
she
said
with
a
sad
smile
and
just
then
aunt
mary
entered
from
the
senator
s
bedroom
see
what
merriam
has
ordered
for
george
said
mollie
june
isn
t
he
thoughtful
very
said
aunt
mary
in
her
customary
dry
tone
code
rockwell
had
returned
with
alicia
he
briskly
declared
that
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
train
mayor
black
it
appeared
was
below
in
his
car
and
was
going
to
the
station
with
them
i
ve
told
simpson
to
take
your
bags
down
except
the
portfolio
you
d
better
keep
that
in
your
own
hands
what
progress
with
the
speeches
not
much
said
merriam
but
i
shall
have
the
whole
evening
on
the
train
i
ll
get
them
he
crossed
the
sick
room
where
hobart
was
now
bending
over
the
senator
apparently
making
an
examination
he
thrust
the
pile
of
manuscripts
back
into
the
portfolio
then
after
a
glance
about
the
room
reminiscent
of
his
burglarious
entry
the
night
before
he
caught
up
his
coat
and
hat
and
returned
to
the
sitting
room
again
are
we
ready
he
asked
of
rockwell
waiting
for
hobart
for
a
final
report
on
the
senator
s
condition
aren
t
you
coming
to
the
station
with
us
mollie
june
alicia
was
saying
no
said
mollie
june
her
eyes
on
a
large
bunch
of
violets
which
she
was
arranging
in
a
bowl
i
must
stay
with
my
husband
but
aunt
mary
will
be
here
i
think
she
owes
it
to
you
to
come
with
us
don
t
you
mr
merriam
no
said
merriam
i
think
she
is
right
in
staying
alicia
looked
from
him
to
mollie
june
then
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
to
rockwell
who
was
cautioning
aunt
mary
as
if
aunt
mary
ever
needed
cautioning
about
maintaining
the
closest
possible
guard
on
the
senator
s
rooms
in
their
absence
merriam
moved
to
mollie
june
s
side
i
shan
t
see
you
again
he
said
no
said
mollie
june
for
a
single
moment
she
looked
up
from
the
flowers
into
his
face
her
eyes
held
tears
and
she
blushed
slightly
in
her
look
he
read
unwilling
love
and
shame
he
would
have
moved
away
impotently
miserable
but
her
hand
which
had
dropped
to
her
side
between
them
suddenly
touched
his
closed
in
his
for
an
instant
and
was
withdrawn
leaving
something
something
very
small
cool
and
fragile
a
single
violet
he
understood
of
course
that
it
was
to
be
his
souvenir
of
her
all
he
could
have
of
her
through
the
long
years
to
come
while
she
played
out
her
loathsome
rôle
as
the
wife
of
the
dissipated
boy
senator
and
he
taught
school
at
riceville
or
what
did
it
matter
what
he
did
his
hand
closed
quickly
on
the
violet
and
he
turned
to
face
hobart
who
was
just
entering
from
the
sick
room
the
physician
was
highly
reassuring
the
senator
was
doing
very
well
indeed
he
ll
be
able
to
meet
us
in
springfield
then
night
demanded
rockwell
i
think
he
ll
be
well
enough
to
do
that
returned
hobart
with
a
slight
evasiveness
which
rockwell
and
merriam
had
occasion
a
few
hours
later
to
recall
with
some
vividness
but
at
the
moment
they
scarcely
noticed
it
good
cried
rockwell
we
re
off
no
wait
he
drew
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
aunt
mary
this
paper
describes
a
simple
form
of
code
telegram
use
it
in
your
messages
to
us
in
regard
to
the
senator
s
progress
and
when
and
where
he
is
to
join
us
you
ll
wire
at
least
once
a
day
of
course
yes
said
aunt
mary
accepting
the
paper
merriam
shook
hands
with
aunt
mary
i
hope
she
said
that
some
day
after
all
this
is
over
we
may
be
able
to
have
you
visit
us
when
george
can
thank
you
for
the
inestimable
service
you
have
rendered
him
i
should
be
delighted
merriam
murmured
though
he
had
no
great
mind
to
be
thanked
by
george
norman
then
he
shook
hands
with
mollie
june
and
met
her
eyes
for
a
moment
but
under
the
gaze
of
aunt
mary
and
rockwell
and
alicia
was
all
he
could
say
thank
you
for
everything
she
replied
and
her
eyes
followed
his
figure
as
rockwell
swept
him
from
the
room
the
closing
of
the
door
of
the
senator
s
sitting
room
upon
merriam
marked
the
beginning
of
a
period
of
a
dozen
hours
or
more
that
was
utterly
phantasmal
and
unreal
to
him
both
at
the
time
and
in
his
recollection
afterwards
he
seemed
to
move
and
speak
and
act
without
volition
and
without
any
clear
realisation
of
what
he
was
doing
or
why
he
was
doing
it
after
dinner
with
rockwell
and
wayward
an
excellent
meal
served
in
the
private
car
by
an
amiable
gentleman
of
colour
merriam
read
the
speech
which
he
was
to
deliver
at
cairo
in
the
morning
and
then
had
to
pull
himself
together
and
commit
that
speech
but
he
did
even
this
mechanically
and
finally
to
bed
in
his
compartment
at
first
to
a
long
uneasy
dream
in
which
he
appeared
to
be
making
an
interminable
speech
to
an
audience
consisting
of
mollie
june
jennie
an
inattentive
floor
clerk
aunt
mary
and
simpson
and
then
to
a
heavy
slumber
from
which
he
was
roused
with
difficulty
the
next
morning
in
the
morning
it
was
the
same
way
with
him
everything
dully
unreal
breakfast
going
over
the
speech
again
then
it
was
nine
o
clock
and
the
train
was
running
into
cairo
a
crowd
at
the
station
a
cheer
or
two
he
was
being
assisted
into
an
automobile
a
sort
of
procession
with
a
band
through
several
blocks
of
streets
to
a
small
park
merriam
found
himself
sitting
with
rockwell
and
wayward
and
several
local
notables
in
a
band
stand
with
a
considerable
concourse
of
people
sitting
and
standing
about
on
the
grass
below
some
native
orator
made
a
short
speech
a
number
by
the
band
then
the
mayor
of
cairo
was
effusively
introducing
senator
norman
the
mayor
sat
down
amid
applause
merriam
rose
advanced
to
the
rail
and
began
on
his
speech
he
felt
himself
to
be
a
sort
of
animated
phonograph
the
words
which
he
had
learned
the
night
before
and
reviewed
that
morning
ran
trippingly
off
his
tongue
his
collegiate
training
and
subsequent
experience
in
public
speaking
came
to
the
aid
of
his
subconscious
self
which
seemed
to
be
functioning
with
practically
no
direction
from
his
higher
centers
he
turned
pleasantly
as
he
spoke
to
face
now
one
part
of
his
circle
of
auditors
and
now
another
he
suited
his
tone
to
the
words
in
different
parts
of
the
speech
he
even
achieved
an
occasional
appropriate
gesture
at
last
he
came
to
the
end
of
what
he
had
learned
and
stopped
as
the
phonograph
stops
when
the
end
of
a
record
is
reached
and
for
a
moment
he
stood
there
by
the
rail
blank
at
a
loss
as
a
phonograph
would
have
stood
he
had
to
rouse
himself
with
a
jerk
of
conscious
attention
before
he
perceived
that
what
he
had
to
do
next
was
to
step
back
and
sit
down
the
applause
was
fairly
satisfactory
the
mayor
of
cairo
leaned
across
rockwell
to
shake
hands
and
congratulate
him
and
wayward
on
the
other
side
patted
his
shoulder
and
said
good
enough
and
the
band
struck
into
a
patriotic
air
merriam
awoke
it
was
as
if
lights
had
been
turned
on
and
doors
opened
he
realised
that
it
was
a
bright
sunny
morning
that
a
band
was
playing
that
he
john
merriam
was
alive
and
young
and
that
he
was
having
a
whimsically
glorious
adventure
which
he
could
not
afford
to
miss
the
joy
of
even
if
mollie
june
was
senator
norman
s
wife
in
this
rejuvenated
mood
he
joyously
descended
with
the
others
from
the
band
stand
and
climbed
into
the
automobile
and
lay
back
happily
between
rockwell
and
the
cairo
mayor
to
relish
the
slow
processional
drive
still
preceded
by
the
band
back
to
the
station
feeling
better
asked
rockwell
who
had
not
failed
to
note
his
previous
lethargy
feeling
fine
he
replied
and
gave
his
attention
to
the
scenery
of
cairo
s
main
street
and
the
crowds
therein
waiting
eagerly
for
a
glimpse
of
the
remarkable
boy
senator
as
the
automobile
passed
close
to
the
curb
on
turning
a
corner
merriam
caught
one
remark
he
does
look
just
like
a
young
man
the
speaker
was
a
decidedly
pretty
girl
in
a
boldish
sort
of
way
merriam
sensed
and
seized
upon
the
privileges
of
age
he
leaned
forward
thank
you
my
dear
he
said
at
least
i
m
young
enough
to
know
a
pretty
girl
when
i
see
one
which
incident
will
serve
to
show
that
merriam
was
really
awake
again
also
it
probably
won
more
votes
for
senator
norman
s
party
at
the
next
election
than
the
whole
of
aunt
mary
s
able
speech
as
delivered
by
the
human
phonograph
a
few
minutes
earlier
they
reached
the
station
and
regained
the
private
car
merriam
sank
into
a
wonderful
armchair
in
the
sitting
room
compartment
glanced
about
him
at
the
luxurious
appointments
and
lit
a
cigarette
with
gusto
i
shouldn
t
mind
this
business
for
quite
a
while
he
thought
mollie
june
was
for
the
time
forgotten
thus
it
is
with
the
fickle
male
rockwell
had
sat
down
in
the
next
chair
merriam
made
an
effort
of
memory
east
louis
next
he
asked
yes
said
rockwell
we
ll
have
to
get
at
the
speech
as
soon
as
the
train
starts
just
then
a
small
but
vociferous
urchin
appeared
in
the
door
of
the
car
his
cap
proclaimed
him
a
telegraph
messenger
telegram
for
mr
rockwell
he
shouted
as
though
rockwell
were
probably
in
the
next
county
rockwell
signed
the
book
and
the
lad
slowly
withdrew
himself
taking
generous
eyefuls
of
rockwell
senator
norman
and
the
private
car
as
he
lingered
with
a
last
backward
stare
in
the
doorway
merriam
winked
at
him
and
the
boy
grinned
and
generously
democratically
winked
back
turning
from
that
wink
to
rockwell
merriam
was
startled
the
man
sat
limp
with
the
telegram
on
his
knee
and
a
pencil
in
his
hand
i
will
not
say
he
was
pale
but
certainly
he
was
haggard
he
handed
the
telegram
to
merriam
merriam
tried
to
read
it
but
could
make
no
sense
at
all
it
was
very
long
but
apparently
a
mere
string
of
words
with
little
intelligible
meaning
what
he
began
it
s
code
said
rockwell
i
ve
underlined
the
words
that
count
picking
out
the
significant
words
by
means
of
rockwell
s
underlining
merriam
read
george
kidnapped
from
rooms
whereabouts
unknown
doctor
disappeared
cancel
trip
return
mary
as
a
moment
later
wayward
who
had
stopped
at
the
station
cigar
stand
to
replenish
his
stock
of
nicotine
rejoined
them
and
was
shown
the
telegram
his
first
comment
was
profane
we
ve
got
to
go
back
said
rockwell
now
that
they
have
norman
in
their
power
for
crockett
is
behind
this
of
course
they
may
denounce
us
may
make
norman
himself
denounce
us
any
minute
they
have
no
end
of
a
grip
on
him
and
he
has
no
great
love
for
the
rôle
of
reformer
himself
nor
for
me
our
only
hope
is
to
get
back
to
chicago
and
find
him
and
get
hold
of
him
again
he
jumped
to
his
feet
i
must
see
the
station
master
at
once
yes
said
wayward
there
s
nothing
else
for
it
rockwell
hastily
departed
to
announce
their
changed
plans
to
the
station
master
and
merriam
and
wayward
looked
at
each
other
the
latter
s
face
had
assumed
the
humorous
smile
which
had
been
his
expression
towards
the
whole
affair
from
the
beginning
it
s
been
a
damn
fool
business
all
along
he
said
i
suppose
it
has
said
merriam
good
fun
for
you
though
wayward
lit
a
cigar
yes
merriam
assented
but
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
back
to
chicago
the
young
rascal
was
realising
that
that
meant
he
should
see
mollie
june
again
wayward
puffed
meditatively
doctor
disappeared
he
quoted
from
the
telegram
that
means
hobart
was
in
it
probably
he
was
the
chief
agent
crockett
s
bribed
him
merriam
suddenly
remembered
the
tableau
which
rockwell
and
he
had
surprised
as
they
stepped
out
of
the
elevator
at
the
hotel
de
soto
on
the
previous
afternoon
hobart
in
confidential
conference
with
the
floor
clerk
probably
they
bribed
the
floor
clerk
too
he
said
hobart
seemed
to
be
sweet
on
her
so
said
wayward
and
after
a
minutes
consideration
very
likely
they
could
hardly
have
managed
without
the
floor
clerk
in
fact
presently
he
added
we
ve
got
to
go
back
all
right
but
i
don
t
what
we
can
do
except
to
surrender
we
still
have
my
pictures
of
crockett
at
jennie
s
well
i
hope
so
unless
they
ve
bribed
simpson
too
those
pictures
are
one
of
the
things
that
may
make
them
give
us
a
chance
to
surrender
the
two
men
smoked
in
silence
for
several
minutes
until
rockwell
returned
well
that
s
fixed
he
announced
there
s
a
express
due
in
half
an
hour
and
reported
on
time
that
will
take
us
into
chicago
by
nine
o
clock
you
re
sick
of
course
senator
he
added
to
merriam
bronchitis
again
they
continued
to
talk
until
the
train
arrived
and
picked
up
their
car
and
they
were
started
on
their
return
trip
at
carbondale
rockwell
sent
off
telegrams
to
the
several
cities
which
merriam
was
to
have
visited
cancelling
senator
norman
s
speaking
tour
on
account
of
a
renewed
attack
of
bronchitis
he
also
sent
a
message
in
code
to
aunt
mary
giving
the
hour
when
they
were
due
to
arrive
the
three
men
talked
of
course
but
they
had
so
few
facts
to
go
on
that
they
could
only
formulate
gloomy
speculations
with
nothing
really
in
the
way
of
definite
conclusion
beyond
what
wayward
and
merriam
had
reached
in
their
first
few
minutes
of
chat
immediately
after
the
arrival
of
aunt
mary
s
message
how
the
kidnapping
had
been
managed
or
where
norman
might
be
they
simply
could
not
tell
they
had
one
practical
point
to
decide
namely
their
first
procedure
on
reaching
the
city
it
was
obviously
not
safe
for
senator
norman
to
go
directly
to
the
hotel
de
soto
they
could
not
tell
what
the
situation
there
might
be
since
the
kidnapping
it
was
finally
agreed
that
rockwell
and
merriam
should
leave
the
train
at
street
and
take
a
taxicab
to
rockwell
s
bachelor
apartment
on
drexel
boulevard
while
wayward
should
go
on
to
the
twelfth
street
station
and
thence
to
the
hotel
to
see
aunt
mary
their
next
step
was
to
depend
on
what
he
learned
there
rockwell
was
afraid
even
to
telephone
from
his
apartment
for
fear
the
wire
to
the
senator
s
suite
might
be
tapped
merriam
was
not
keen
on
this
arrangement
because
it
evidently
postponed
his
seeing
mollie
june
and
might
even
prevent
his
doing
so
altogether
but
this
was
not
an
objection
which
he
could
raise
in
the
discussion
at
last
they
were
running
into
the
city
street
was
reached
and
rockwell
and
merriam
shook
hands
with
wayward
and
descended
from
the
private
car
rockwell
s
first
act
in
the
station
was
to
buy
an
evening
paper
he
scanned
the
sheet
anxiously
with
merriam
looking
over
his
shoulder
the
first
page
carried
a
paragraph
reporting
the
abandonment
of
senator
norman
s
speaking
tour
on
account
of
a
return
of
his
bronchitis
rockwell
had
sent
no
word
to
this
effect
to
any
one
in
chicago
but
evidently
the
news
had
come
in
from
some
one
or
more
of
the
towns
to
which
he
had
wired
cancellations
there
were
however
no
headlines
in
regard
to
the
kidnapping
of
a
united
states
senator
from
one
of
the
city
s
leading
hotels
and
no
exposé
of
their
imposture
they
re
still
keeping
it
dark
said
rockwell
with
a
flash
of
renewed
hope
on
his
haggard
face
we
re
going
to
have
a
chance
to
make
terms
a
moment
later
they
were
in
a
taxicab
bound
for
his
apartment
they
rode
in
silence
merriam
wondered
if
he
should
see
mollie
june
again
though
just
what
good
that
would
do
him
or
what
he
should
say
to
her
he
could
not
have
told
i
shall
see
her
once
alone
he
said
to
himself
whatever
happens
i
ve
done
enough
for
them
to
have
a
right
to
demand
that
and
on
that
scene
of
unhappy
farewell
for
what
else
could
it
be
his
thoughts
halted
his
mind
would
go
no
farther
the
taxicab
stopped
and
they
got
out
and
merriam
found
himself
in
front
of
a
decidedly
imposing
apartment
building
rockwell
hurried
him
through
a
sumptuous
entry
and
into
an
elevator
they
shot
up
three
flights
then
in
a
hallway
rockwell
unlocked
a
door
and
they
entered
the
sitting
room
of
his
apartment
a
large
room
in
quiet
tones
furnished
somewhat
in
the
taste
of
a
good
men
s
club
merriam
sank
into
a
chair
played
out
asked
rockwell
standing
over
him
and
speaking
in
his
old
manner
of
good
humour
which
had
deserted
him
during
that
trying
day
yes
said
merriam
he
felt
in
fact
quite
exhausted
although
he
had
done
nothing
since
ten
o
clock
that
morning
except
smoke
and
eat
two
meals
and
wait
so
am
i
said
rockwell
and
we
must
get
fit
again
we
may
have
a
busy
night
ahead
suppose
we
have
a
shower
and
then
coffee
that
ll
brace
us
up
three
quarters
of
an
hour
later
the
two
men
much
refreshed
by
the
shock
of
cold
water
and
the
odd
stimulation
which
always
follows
in
fresh
clothes
were
sitting
on
opposite
sides
of
rockwell
s
writing
table
waiting
for
an
electric
percolator
to
perk
when
the
doorbell
rang
they
looked
at
each
other
curtain
up
for
the
last
act
said
rockwell
as
he
went
to
answer
it
it
was
wayward
with
aunt
mary
and
father
murray
and
mayor
black
mollie
june
merriam
saw
was
not
with
them
come
in
said
rockwell
oddly
formal
merriam
as
he
rose
noticed
the
change
in
aunt
mary
always
before
she
had
seemed
a
creature
of
no
age
at
all
now
she
was
obviously
a
quite
elderly
woman
the
mayor
s
plump
face
was
gray
and
drawn
with
anxiety
even
wayward
looked
more
worried
than
he
had
seemed
all
day
for
a
moment
the
four
of
them
stood
together
just
inside
the
room
staring
at
merriam
accusingly
as
it
were
as
if
he
had
been
the
cause
of
their
trouble
but
rockwell
having
closed
the
door
turned
and
after
one
glance
at
the
group
spoke
loudly
with
exaggerated
briskness
sit
down
all
of
you
and
tell
me
you
ll
find
this
a
comfortable
chair
aunt
mary
over
there
mayor
you
re
at
home
here
wayward
father
murray
took
aunt
mary
s
arm
and
led
her
to
the
chair
rockwell
had
indicated
solemnly
they
all
sat
down
rockwell
was
both
daunted
and
impatient
after
another
look
at
aunt
mary
he
turned
to
the
mayor
when
did
it
happen
but
before
the
mayor
could
reply
aunt
mary
spoke
up
she
was
not
so
far
gone
as
she
looked
between
five
minutes
after
eight
and
half
past
nine
this
morning
she
said
mollie
june
and
i
had
gone
downstairs
for
breakfast
in
the
wedgewood
room
and
then
for
a
short
walk
over
to
michigan
avenue
and
back
hobart
suggested
both
he
said
we
ought
to
get
out
that
much
before
we
settled
down
for
the
day
in
the
rooms
and
that
he
would
stay
with
george
till
we
returned
he
said
that
george
was
much
better
and
he
looked
better
when
we
got
back
it
was
exactly
half
past
nine
both
he
and
george
were
gone
aunt
mary
paused
for
an
instant
on
this
disastrous
climax
we
were
terribly
upset
she
continued
we
could
hardly
believe
our
senses
mollie
june
cried
and
at
first
i
could
not
think
what
i
ought
to
do
but
presently
i
had
mind
enough
to
telephone
for
mayor
black
and
father
murray
and
by
the
time
they
came
i
was
calm
enough
to
think
quietly
and
join
them
in
making
plans
you
were
wonderful
said
father
murray
we
could
make
no
kind
of
announcement
or
complaint
george
was
not
supposed
to
be
there
you
she
looked
at
merriam
were
probably
at
that
very
moment
making
a
speech
in
his
name
at
cairo
we
could
say
nothing
to
anybody
we
figured
out
that
you
were
either
still
at
cairo
or
on
your
way
to
east
louis
and
we
sent
messages
to
rockwell
at
both
places
we
had
to
stop
that
insane
speaking
tour
and
get
you
both
back
here
as
soon
as
possible
we
telephoned
to
the
hotel
office
for
hobart
but
they
said
he
had
resigned
as
house
physician
the
night
before
then
we
sent
for
simpson
he
didn
t
seem
greatly
surprised
in
fact
he
said
that
hobart
had
offered
him
money
early
that
morning
to
help
in
restoring
senator
norman
to
his
real
that
seems
to
have
been
the
way
hobart
put
it
simpson
refused
the
money
he
said
and
didn
t
learn
what
the
plan
was
he
said
that
he
had
meant
to
tell
me
of
the
offer
but
hadn
t
been
able
to
get
away
from
his
work
it
was
still
only
a
couple
of
hours
since
hobart
had
talked
with
him
he
said
he
would
try
to
find
hobart
and
learn
where
george
was
and
then
he
went
away
and
we
haven
t
heard
from
him
since
finally
i
went
out
to
see
the
floor
clerk
thinking
she
must
have
seen
when
george
was
taken
out
but
there
was
a
new
girl
the
former
one
had
quit
she
said
at
nine
o
clock
simply
telephoned
the
office
that
she
was
leaving
and
hung
up
and
slipped
away
have
you
tried
to
see
crockett
rockwell
asked
i
have
said
the
mayor
been
trying
all
day
but
both
at
his
office
and
at
his
house
they
say
he
isn
t
in
and
they
don
t
know
where
he
is
or
when
he
will
be
back
and
he
wasn
t
at
any
of
his
clubs
it
s
a
pretty
clean
said
rockwell
merriam
spoke
up
i
have
some
hopes
of
simpson
he
said
his
continued
absence
may
mean
that
he
is
following
some
sort
of
trail
maybe
said
rockwell
meanwhile
this
coffee
he
drew
attention
to
the
percolator
is
getting
pretty
black
and
black
coffee
is
what
we
all
need
after
that
we
ll
see
where
is
mrs
norman
merriam
asked
timidly
while
rockwell
was
pouring
and
passing
the
coffee
we
left
her
at
the
hotel
with
alicia
said
wayward
we
had
to
leave
some
one
there
in
case
some
message
should
come
from
simpson
or
from
crockett
or
from
george
himself
the
coffee
was
drunk
in
a
dismal
silence
wayward
attempted
one
or
two
remarks
but
they
fell
flat
the
first
question
said
rockwell
when
the
cups
had
been
emptied
is
where
is
george
norman
crockett
may
have
taken
him
to
his
own
house
but
that
is
unlikely
or
to
some
other
hotel
or
to
one
of
his
clubs
or
if
he
is
still
really
sick
to
a
hospital
i
think
myself
a
hotel
is
the
most
probable
that
could
have
been
managed
with
a
minimum
of
explanations
in
any
case
we
have
got
to
find
him
but
this
is
no
case
for
amateurs
i
propose
to
engage
a
professional
private
detective
and
commission
him
to
find
george
also
hobart
it
oughtn
t
to
take
him
more
than
hours
then
we
can
make
further
plans
if
norman
is
still
sick
we
may
have
to
him
if
he
is
up
and
himself
again
it
will
be
a
matter
of
parleying
with
him
and
crockett
and
making
such
terms
as
we
can
has
any
one
a
better
suggestion
it
appeared
that
no
one
had
and
rockwell
was
looking
up
the
detective
agency
when
the
doorbell
rang
again
father
murray
sprang
to
his
feet
yes
you
answer
it
said
rockwell
before
the
priest
could
reach
the
door
an
impatient
sounded
on
the
panel
he
opened
to
alicia
and
simpson
good
heavens
you
re
slow
cried
alicia
and
glum
as
the
grave
she
added
glancing
about
the
circle
of
faces
simpson
has
found
george
there
were
exclamations
rockwell
put
down
the
telephone
book
and
went
to
alicia
dear
he
said
and
alicia
turning
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
you
poor
fellow
she
cried
then
rockwell
turned
to
simpson
sit
down
here
simpson
he
said
have
some
coffee
you
look
fagged
thank
you
sir
i
pretty
much
all
in
rockwell
drew
a
cup
of
coffee
and
took
it
to
him
and
the
waiter
gulped
it
down
thank
you
sir
he
said
again
now
i
can
tell
you
i
owe
a
good
deal
to
that
young
gentleman
he
indicated
merriam
and
when
i
saw
the
trouble
you
were
all
in
i
decided
to
do
what
i
could
of
course
we
knew
crockett
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
thing
and
i
decided
he
was
the
most
findable
person
in
it
i
figured
that
he
wouldn
t
appear
at
his
office
and
wouldn
t
go
home
but
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
show
up
at
one
of
his
clubs
you
remember
i
asked
you
this
morning
what
clubs
he
belonged
to
this
to
mayor
black
the
mayor
assented
you
mentioned
five
that
was
a
pretty
large
order
but
i
got
some
of
my
pals
who
are
taxicab
drivers
to
help
me
and
between
us
we
kept
a
pretty
close
watch
on
all
of
them
he
didn
t
come
near
the
one
i
was
watching
myself
and
i
didn
t
hear
anything
from
the
others
till
five
o
clock
then
one
of
the
boys
sent
word
to
me
that
he
had
entered
the
grill
club
on
monroe
street
i
went
right
over
and
hung
around
there
for
nearly
three
hours
it
was
a
quarter
to
eight
when
he
came
out
he
took
a
taxi
and
i
followed
in
another
he
drove
to
john
s
hospital
over
on
the
west
side
i
was
right
after
him
and
followed
him
into
the
building
he
doesn
t
know
me
of
course
and
paid
no
attention
to
me
he
spoke
to
the
nurse
at
the
desk
and
then
stepped
into
a
waiting
room
the
nurse
looked
hard
at
me
but
i
said
i
m
with
him
and
stepped
back
towards
the
door
she
thought
i
was
his
man
and
took
no
further
notice
of
me
pretty
soon
hobart
came
down
he
didn
t
see
me
but
i
saw
him
plainly
he
looked
pretty
much
worried
scared
i
thought
he
and
crockett
talked
for
a
while
in
the
waiting
room
but
i
couldn
t
hear
anything
they
said
then
crockett
left
and
hobart
went
back
upstairs
i
could
have
spoken
to
him
after
crockett
had
gone
out
but
i
thought
i
had
better
not
let
them
know
that
any
one
was
on
their
trail
for
fear
they
would
move
him
again
then
i
had
an
idea
i
went
up
to
the
desk
again
i
said
to
the
nurse
how
is
merriam
she
looked
at
me
he
s
pretty
sick
she
said
and
turned
away
i
didn
t
see
what
more
i
could
do
so
i
took
my
taxi
back
to
the
de
soto
and
went
up
to
the
senator
s
suite
and
found
miss
wayward
and
norman
and
miss
wayward
brought
me
here
for
a
moment
rockwell
seemed
sunk
in
thought
then
he
roused
himself
glanced
around
the
circle
of
faces
and
spoke
first
of
all
simpson
i
want
to
say
that
you
have
done
a
very
clever
bit
of
work
we
were
about
to
engage
a
private
detective
to
undertake
what
you
have
already
accomplished
i
think
i
can
safely
say
that
we
will
see
that
you
are
suitably
rewarded
you
can
said
wayward
emphatically
which
was
satisfactory
since
he
was
the
person
present
from
whom
any
substantial
monetary
reward
must
come
thank
you
sir
said
simpson
the
mayor
broke
in
it
s
pretty
clear
what
has
happened
they
got
norman
downstairs
while
miss
norman
and
norman
were
at
breakfast
put
him
in
a
taxi
drove
to
the
hospital
and
entered
him
under
the
name
of
merriam
and
hobart
has
stayed
in
attendance
and
he
s
still
sick
perhaps
worse
said
aunt
mary
anxiously
why
did
they
enter
him
as
merriam
asked
rockwell
thinking
aloud
it
must
mean
that
crockett
doesn
t
dare
denounce
us
or
doesn
t
wish
to
do
so
that
he
means
to
make
terms
with
us
and
preserve
the
secrecy
of
the
whole
affair
as
i
see
it
there
will
have
to
be
one
more
substitution
he
addressed
the
real
owner
of
the
name
of
merriam
of
you
for
norman
at
the
hospital
you
have
reported
yourself
to
your
riceville
people
as
sick
very
well
you
have
gone
to
a
hospital
from
the
hospital
you
return
to
your
work
it
will
strengthen
your
alibi
and
norman
will
be
restored
to
us
on
crockett
s
conditions
of
course
but
we
shall
escape
the
worst
we
shall
come
off
safe
yet
but
it
must
happen
at
once
he
continued
with
a
note
of
new
anxiety
the
whole
state
knows
that
norman
s
speaking
tour
has
been
abandoned
that
he
came
back
to
chicago
that
he
is
in
the
city
now
we
must
get
hold
of
crockett
some
way
the
final
substitution
must
be
made
before
morning
wayward
was
looking
at
his
watch
it
s
eleven
o
clock
now
he
said
but
you
d
better
try
telephoning
his
clubs
i
think
yes
said
rockwell
the
grill
club
that
s
where
you
found
him
simpson
he
may
have
gone
back
there
for
the
night
i
ll
try
that
first
he
went
quickly
to
the
telephone
while
rockwell
was
looking
up
the
number
and
the
rest
waiting
in
painful
expectancy
the
doorbell
for
the
third
time
startled
them
i
ll
go
sir
said
simpson
in
a
moment
he
had
opened
the
door
on
the
threshold
stood
crockett
a
pale
hesitant
almost
seedy
crockett
very
different
from
the
serene
confident
financier
whom
merriam
had
first
encountered
hours
before
at
jennie
s
rockwell
dropped
the
book
come
in
crockett
i
was
just
going
to
phone
to
you
crockett
advanced
a
couple
of
steps
into
the
room
then
he
stopped
there
was
something
portentous
in
his
air
of
mournful
gravity
his
eyes
travelled
from
face
to
face
for
a
moment
they
rested
on
merriam
then
they
came
to
a
full
stop
on
aunt
mary
the
whole
roomful
remained
silent
fascinated
by
his
look
which
seemed
to
speak
not
of
threat
which
they
might
have
expected
but
of
some
disaster
beyond
threat
at
last
with
an
effort
he
turned
his
eyes
from
aunt
mary
to
rockwell
i
have
to
tell
you
he
said
that
george
norman
is
dead
final
i
do
not
suppose
crockett
desired
to
be
unnecessarily
cruel
doubtless
he
would
have
preferred
to
break
his
devastating
news
more
gently
but
he
was
himself
in
a
state
of
nervous
exhaustion
from
fatigue
worry
and
perhaps
remorse
and
the
circle
of
anxious
faces
had
proved
too
much
for
his
realising
too
late
the
brutal
bluntness
of
his
announcement
he
broke
into
a
hurried
flow
of
words
we
took
him
from
the
hotel
this
morning
to
john
s
hospital
we
thought
he
would
be
just
as
well
off
there
even
better
off
hobart
thought
he
was
nearly
well
anyway
but
the
ride
and
the
effort
of
listening
to
hobart
s
explanations
apparently
fatigued
him
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
hospital
he
was
very
sick
again
his
bronchitis
if
it
ever
was
bronchitis
turned
into
pneumonia
double
acute
pneumonia
he
got
worse
and
worse
all
day
hobart
and
the
physicians
and
nurses
at
the
hospital
did
everything
possible
for
him
but
it
was
no
use
he
died
at
nine
o
clock
all
eyes
turned
suddenly
to
aunt
mary
who
had
risen
holding
on
to
the
back
of
her
chair
father
murray
was
at
her
side
in
an
instant
and
alicia
hurried
to
her
no
said
aunt
mary
brokenly
i
m
not
going
to
faint
or
anything
but
i
want
to
be
alone
rockwell
sprang
to
his
feet
my
bedroom
he
said
and
led
the
way
to
the
door
of
his
chamber
which
opened
off
the
sitting
room
in
a
moment
aunt
mary
walking
between
father
murray
and
alicia
had
passed
into
the
bedroom
wayward
s
voice
broke
the
stillness
poor
fellow
he
said
for
a
minute
or
two
they
all
paid
the
tribute
of
silence
to
the
dead
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
really
very
sorry
for
george
norman
he
had
had
an
easy
life
wealth
luxury
fame
and
a
good
time
according
to
his
own
conception
of
a
good
time
up
to
the
very
beginning
of
his
brief
illness
that
his
last
few
largely
unconscious
hours
had
been
passed
in
a
hospital
away
from
his
friends
had
certainly
been
almost
no
grief
to
him
the
only
sorrow
genuinely
possible
was
over
the
common
folly
and
the
universal
final
tragedy
of
humankind
in
a
few
moments
the
thoughts
of
the
entire
group
that
remained
in
rockwell
s
sitting
room
were
irresistibly
drawn
back
to
the
strange
and
somewhat
dangerous
situation
in
which
the
unexpected
death
had
left
them
presently
rockwell
spoke
technically
crockett
i
suppose
it
is
not
senator
norman
but
merriam
who
died
at
john
s
hospital
merriam
was
somewhat
startled
at
this
turn
of
thought
this
phase
of
the
matter
had
not
yet
occurred
to
him
you
have
made
no
announcement
rockwell
asked
no
said
crockett
i
have
done
nothing
when
hobart
telephoned
me
that
what
had
happened
i
rushed
out
to
the
hospital
again
i
don
t
know
why
i
couldn
t
believe
it
then
i
telephoned
from
the
hospital
to
the
de
soto
and
got
norman
and
she
told
me
you
were
all
here
so
i
came
here
i
have
done
nothing
while
he
was
speaking
alicia
and
father
murray
returned
from
the
bedroom
she
is
all
right
said
alicia
she
asked
us
to
leave
her
alone
for
a
few
minutes
did
you
tell
mrs
norman
she
added
addressing
crockett
what
had
happened
yes
said
crockett
merriam
s
thoughts
flew
to
mollie
june
alone
in
the
vast
heartless
hotel
with
the
news
of
her
husband
s
death
ought
not
some
one
to
go
to
her
he
asked
presently
said
rockwell
we
must
first
consider
the
situation
a
little
hers
as
well
as
ours
mayor
black
spoke
up
it
will
be
pretty
awkward
for
her
aside
from
natural
grief
and
all
that
that
her
husband
should
have
died
in
a
hospital
under
another
name
without
her
being
present
while
the
man
to
whom
the
other
name
belongs
was
impersonating
him
in
public
and
awkward
for
miss
norman
for
the
rest
of
us
too
damned
awkward
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
have
to
close
the
career
of
george
norman
with
such
a
story
said
wayward
it
must
never
happen
said
a
voice
behind
them
they
all
turned
aunt
mary
was
standing
in
the
door
of
the
bedroom
she
already
looked
more
like
herself
she
was
one
of
those
souls
who
may
sink
under
passive
anxiety
and
suspense
but
find
themselves
again
immediately
when
a
call
for
action
comes
she
had
scarcely
been
left
alone
apparently
when
the
same
thought
which
the
mayor
and
wayward
had
expressed
had
occurred
to
her
the
peril
to
the
name
of
norman
which
was
perhaps
even
more
dear
to
her
than
her
brother
himself
had
been
and
instantly
by
some
powerful
effort
of
will
she
had
put
grief
behind
her
and
turned
to
face
this
new
danger
it
must
never
happen
she
repeated
advancing
into
the
room
where
alicia
and
the
men
too
unmindful
of
the
etiquette
which
should
have
brought
them
to
their
feet
sat
staring
at
her
the
secret
must
be
kept
it
is
more
important
now
than
ever
with
george
alive
it
would
not
have
mattered
so
much
he
would
have
lived
it
down
triumphantly
only
the
rest
of
us
would
have
suffered
not
he
nor
the
name
but
now
must
be
but
how
it
be
kept
said
crockett
in
a
tone
of
desperation
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
then
rockwell
looking
from
face
to
face
drew
a
deep
breath
there
is
just
one
way
he
said
it
was
john
merriam
who
died
senator
norman
is
alive
he
waved
his
hand
at
merriam
he
must
go
on
living
but
that
is
impossible
said
mayor
black
and
merriam
together
face
the
alternative
first
said
rockwell
george
the
real
george
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
about
nine
o
clock
this
morning
at
that
same
hour
senator
norman
was
making
a
speech
at
cairo
before
an
audience
representing
the
entire
county
that
is
known
all
over
the
state
he
took
the
next
train
back
to
chicago
but
that
train
did
not
reach
chicago
until
after
after
the
death
we
could
have
the
hour
of
the
death
changed
on
the
records
proposed
wayward
it
is
already
announced
all
over
the
state
that
senator
norman
is
ill
again
he
could
be
rushed
from
the
train
to
the
hospital
and
die
there
during
the
night
then
we
should
have
two
deaths
on
our
hands
said
rockwell
and
only
one
body
unless
we
bring
merriam
to
life
again
how
are
we
to
do
that
it
is
pretty
hard
to
get
hospital
authorities
to
falsify
their
records
and
dozens
of
people
must
know
the
supposed
facts
nurses
doctors
clerks
at
the
hospital
we
could
never
keep
them
all
from
talking
the
reporters
would
get
hold
of
it
within
hours
no
senator
norman
can
not
have
died
at
the
hospital
he
is
alive
he
must
go
on
living
can
t
he
die
at
the
hotel
or
said
merriam
then
what
becomes
of
you
asked
rockwell
why
i
should
go
back
to
riceville
you
can
t
you
re
dead
and
how
can
senator
norman
die
at
the
hotel
when
we
should
not
be
able
to
produce
his
body
there
we
could
get
the
body
said
wayward
speaking
in
a
lowered
tone
as
merriam
s
friends
we
would
take
his
body
away
from
the
hospital
to
be
buried
and
bring
it
to
the
hotel
we
shall
have
to
send
for
the
real
merriam
s
friends
said
rockwell
from
riceville
and
wherever
your
people
live
he
looked
at
merriam
we
should
have
no
body
to
show
them
we
could
bury
a
loaded
casket
but
why
should
we
who
must
be
strangers
to
him
from
their
point
of
view
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
when
they
could
get
here
in
a
few
hours
probably
they
would
want
to
take
his
body
elsewhere
for
burial
very
likely
they
would
have
the
coffin
we
had
buried
raised
and
opened
and
how
could
we
get
a
dead
body
into
the
hotel
de
soto
up
a
fire
escape
in
the
earnestness
of
his
argument
rockwell
evidently
did
not
realise
the
gruesomeness
of
his
language
aunt
mary
shuddered
no
she
said
i
will
not
have
george
s
body
smuggled
about
the
city
she
paused
looking
strangely
at
merriam
none
of
the
others
not
even
rockwell
ventured
to
speak
alicia
told
me
i
believe
that
you
have
no
near
relatives
she
said
presently
none
nearer
than
cousins
merriam
replied
for
a
long
minute
more
aunt
mary
stared
at
him
she
closed
her
eyes
opened
them
and
looked
again
then
her
lips
shut
tight
for
a
moment
in
an
expression
of
momentous
decision
she
leaned
forward
you
have
the
norman
blood
in
you
she
said
to
merriam
on
your
mother
s
side
you
are
fine
stuff
we
have
all
seen
that
we
will
make
a
norman
of
you
if
you
will
you
shall
take
george
s
place
to
save
his
name
but
merriam
began
but
rockwell
cut
in
it
s
absolutely
the
only
way
he
cried
the
only
other
alternative
is
to
let
the
whole
story
come
out
then
that
s
what
we
have
to
do
said
wayward
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
no
said
aunt
mary
no
echoed
rockwell
think
what
that
means
to
george
s
memory
first
of
all
that
in
his
last
hours
his
relatives
and
friends
were
conspiring
against
him
with
the
help
of
a
stranger
double
to
force
him
to
abandon
the
kind
of
life
he
was
leading
and
the
disreputable
interests
with
which
he
was
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
crockett
crockett
waved
a
feeble
hand
to
indicate
forgiveness
or
indifference
and
then
to
mollie
june
rockwell
continued
that
she
had
connived
at
the
impersonation
of
her
husband
during
his
last
illness
by
another
man
how
far
did
that
other
man
take
her
husband
s
place
will
be
the
question
every
man
and
woman
in
the
state
will
ask
and
all
the
rest
of
us
aunt
mary
and
merriam
who
will
lose
his
job
and
his
professional
standing
and
the
mayor
and
myself
who
will
be
ruined
politically
and
every
other
way
even
you
wayward
would
find
yourself
in
an
exceedingly
unpleasant
situation
and
crockett
on
the
other
side
would
be
no
better
off
for
the
story
of
the
kidnapping
must
come
out
the
wilted
financier
uttered
a
sort
of
groan
but
can
the
other
thing
be
done
asked
the
mayor
the
perspiration
of
mental
anguish
showing
on
his
forehead
certainly
it
can
said
rockwell
eagerly
senator
norman
has
come
back
to
chicago
here
he
is
presently
he
will
arrive
at
the
hotel
he
will
be
pretty
sick
you
and
i
he
looked
at
wayward
will
support
him
to
the
elevator
and
to
his
rooms
he
will
be
ill
for
several
days
we
must
get
hold
of
hobart
again
to
attend
him
then
we
will
announce
that
he
is
threatened
with
tuberculosis
and
is
to
retire
from
public
life
he
must
resign
his
seat
in
the
senate
we
daren
t
go
ahead
with
that
it
would
be
too
dangerous
and
too
serious
a
fraud
besides
evidently
there
was
some
limit
to
a
reformer
s
unscrupulousness
he
will
go
to
his
ranch
in
colorado
to
recuperate
you
will
actually
go
he
was
addressing
merriam
now
you
must
live
there
for
a
year
or
so
during
that
time
only
a
few
of
norman
s
private
friends
will
visit
you
we
will
coach
you
up
on
these
a
few
at
a
time
if
any
of
them
notice
any
slight
changes
in
you
they
will
lay
it
to
your
illness
you
will
easily
take
your
place
in
the
whole
circle
of
his
private
life
but
the
property
said
wayward
the
norman
fortune
reverts
to
me
and
mollie
june
said
aunt
mary
who
was
evidently
heart
and
soul
with
rockwell
if
we
are
satisfied
she
stopped
the
mention
of
mollie
june
had
recalled
a
phase
of
the
situation
which
rockwell
and
the
mayor
and
even
wayward
had
apparently
forgotten
so
little
are
men
accustomed
to
consider
their
women
folk
when
the
real
game
of
business
or
politics
is
on
merriam
and
alicia
had
not
forgotten
it
but
had
not
been
able
so
far
to
get
a
word
in
as
for
aunt
mary
i
can
not
say
she
was
so
near
to
being
a
man
herself
mollie
june
repeated
rockwell
aghast
exactly
said
merriam
somewhat
bitterly
him
too
rockwell
had
been
treating
pretty
much
as
a
lifeless
pawn
in
the
game
but
aunt
mary
when
roused
was
equal
to
anything
we
shall
manage
that
she
said
i
will
go
to
colorado
with
merriam
mollie
june
can
return
to
her
father
for
a
time
we
can
arrange
a
separation
or
even
aunt
mary
hesitated
but
alicia
took
the
cue
or
they
can
be
married
or
remarried
she
said
fixing
her
bright
eyes
with
a
gleam
of
mischievous
understanding
in
them
on
merriam
the
argument
had
come
to
a
full
stop
the
whole
roomful
sat
looking
at
merriam
who
tried
to
think
and
found
he
could
not
except
that
he
realised
that
all
the
rest
had
tacitly
accepted
rockwell
s
plan
come
said
alicia
vivaciously
it
isn
t
so
bad
is
it
the
norman
fortune
and
mollie
june
bad
the
prospect
was
so
dazzling
to
merriam
that
he
could
not
take
his
mind
off
it
in
order
to
think
calmly
to
die
to
his
old
self
to
his
poverty
and
loneliness
to
his
teaching
with
which
he
had
long
been
bored
and
to
step
as
if
by
magic
into
a
new
life
with
wealth
leisure
and
mollie
june
for
surely
she
loved
him
and
she
had
not
loved
george
norman
she
would
marry
him
after
an
interval
of
course
i
must
think
he
said
weakly
in
response
to
alicia
s
exhortation
of
course
you
must
said
rockwell
you
must
accustom
your
mind
to
it
but
it
will
all
be
perfectly
easy
you
were
brought
up
on
a
farm
weren
t
you
you
will
take
to
the
ranch
life
like
anything
it
s
mostly
you
can
go
in
for
scientific
farming
after
a
few
months
it
would
probably
be
a
good
thing
for
you
to
travel
perhaps
for
a
year
or
two
especially
if
you
and
mollie
june
should
marry
get
out
of
the
country
so
as
to
leave
norman
s
old
life
entirely
behind
you
for
a
while
you
might
take
a
trip
around
the
world
merriam
s
youthful
heart
bounded
in
spite
of
himself
a
trip
around
the
world
with
mollie
june
as
to
your
old
self
rockwell
continued
that
s
quite
simple
too
norman
was
entered
at
the
hospital
under
your
name
a
death
certificate
must
have
been
given
by
now
he
looked
at
crockett
i
don
t
know
said
crockett
hobart
may
have
held
off
on
that
at
any
rate
it
can
be
in
fact
it
will
have
to
be
hobart
shall
telegraph
to
riceville
and
to
your
cousins
wherever
they
are
he
was
the
house
physician
at
the
de
soto
where
you
took
sick
that
was
how
he
came
to
be
attending
you
when
you
got
bad
he
took
you
to
the
hospital
nothing
more
natural
the
rest
of
us
will
not
need
to
appear
at
all
aunt
mary
will
have
to
appear
said
alicia
she
will
want
to
attend
the
funeral
she
became
acquainted
with
you
at
the
hotel
then
said
rockwell
took
an
interest
in
a
young
man
who
was
alone
and
ill
when
your
relatives
and
friends
come
hobart
will
have
the
body
already
laid
out
in
a
casket
he
can
advise
immediate
burial
here
in
the
city
aunt
mary
can
offer
a
lot
in
the
norman
plot
at
lakewood
would
your
cousins
probably
consent
to
that
very
likely
said
merriam
rather
in
a
daze
it
was
confusing
to
be
discussing
the
details
of
one
s
own
interment
then
everything
will
follow
in
regular
course
said
rockwell
speaking
as
if
all
difficulties
were
solved
george
will
be
buried
with
his
family
and
you
can
start
for
colorado
for
a
second
time
the
talk
came
to
a
full
stop
the
new
plan
was
outlined
in
full
it
remained
only
to
decide
upon
it
or
to
reject
it
and
face
the
alternative
of
a
public
confession
all
of
them
except
merriam
had
already
accepted
the
scheme
apparently
gruesome
and
bizarre
as
it
was
it
was
for
all
the
rest
so
much
the
easiest
way
and
the
most
advantageous
but
it
did
not
require
any
of
them
to
die
to
die
to
his
own
self
his
friends
his
very
name
on
the
other
hand
it
did
not
offer
them
any
such
positive
rewards
as
were
proffered
to
merriam
a
fortune
and
love
we
can
hardly
wonder
that
he
was
somewhat
stupefied
by
the
alternatives
that
beat
upon
his
mind
the
loss
of
all
that
up
to
this
point
in
his
life
had
been
his
identity
versus
mollie
june
that
was
the
essence
of
the
struggle
within
him
he
sat
beside
rockwell
s
table
staring
at
the
now
silent
percolator
trying
to
think
but
able
only
to
feel
the
others
were
looking
uneasily
at
him
and
at
one
another
aunt
mary
s
eyes
and
alicia
s
demanded
of
rockwell
who
had
always
managed
everything
that
he
should
manage
this
too
once
he
started
to
speak
but
gave
it
up
and
looked
appealingly
at
alicia
instead
indeed
he
might
justifiably
feel
that
this
was
alicia
s
job
she
acknowledged
as
much
in
her
own
mind
and
was
trying
to
decide
what
to
do
or
say
when
the
one
person
present
who
had
not
spoken
throughout
the
entire
scene
came
to
the
rescue
through
all
their
long
discussion
simpson
had
stood
unobtrusive
and
unnoticed
in
the
background
but
he
had
followed
every
word
for
his
fortunes
too
humble
indeed
but
sufficiently
important
to
him
were
bound
up
in
this
decision
if
the
deception
was
to
be
continued
his
assistance
in
the
matter
of
silence
at
least
would
be
necessary
and
he
could
expect
a
large
honorarium
if
it
came
to
a
public
confession
he
could
still
expect
something
but
probably
a
good
deal
less
and
to
win
and
hold
jennie
he
needed
a
considerable
sum
of
money
so
now
he
advanced
a
step
and
spoke
shall
i
call
a
taxi
for
you
merriam
to
take
you
to
the
hotel
of
course
cried
alicia
jumping
up
you
must
go
and
see
mollie
june
it
all
depends
now
upon
her
the
others
too
stirred
and
expressed
more
or
less
audible
acquiescence
and
simpson
had
his
reward
in
the
shape
of
approving
glances
from
rockwell
and
wayward
merriam
got
to
his
feet
with
the
other
men
because
alicia
had
risen
he
was
not
so
obtuse
nor
so
much
dazed
that
he
did
not
see
what
they
were
doing
they
were
trying
to
rush
him
they
calculated
that
though
mollie
june
in
the
abstract
might
contend
indecisively
with
other
abstract
considerations
mollie
june
in
the
flesh
would
decide
him
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
saw
that
plainly
enough
nevertheless
for
his
part
it
did
now
depend
altogether
upon
mollie
june
if
he
was
to
do
this
thing
to
abandon
his
old
self
and
enter
upon
what
must
be
in
some
degree
a
lifelong
career
of
deception
it
would
be
for
her
sake
not
only
in
order
to
win
her
sooner
years
sooner
than
he
could
otherwise
have
the
slightest
hope
of
doing
but
to
save
her
from
scandal
and
because
she
loved
him
and
wanted
him
too
at
once
comparatively
speaking
as
he
wanted
her
so
his
decision
was
made
almost
as
soon
as
he
was
on
his
feet
he
looked
with
some
dignity
from
one
waiting
face
to
another
about
the
circle
yes
he
said
quietly
it
does
depend
on
her
you
may
call
a
taxi
simpson
almost
before
merriam
s
brief
sentence
was
out
of
his
mouth
simpson
had
started
for
the
telephone
but
mayor
black
spoke
up
my
car
and
chauffeur
are
below
we
came
up
from
the
hotel
in
it
you
can
use
it
you
go
with
him
aunt
mary
said
rockwell
again
taking
command
you
see
her
first
he
continued
merriam
can
wait
somewhere
in
mr
wilson
s
room
when
you
have
explained
the
general
situation
you
can
call
him
in
and
leave
them
together
and
give
him
his
chance
even
at
this
moment
it
was
a
slight
shock
to
merriam
to
realise
that
the
state
of
feeling
between
himself
and
mollie
june
which
they
had
supposed
completely
hidden
had
been
clearly
perceived
by
the
others
or
at
least
he
thought
swiftly
by
rockwell
and
aunt
mary
and
alicia
he
smiled
a
little
cynically
to
himself
as
he
understood
that
they
had
been
willing
to
use
this
interest
of
his
as
a
motive
in
securing
his
easy
acquiescence
in
their
previous
schemes
evidently
they
were
counting
on
it
in
mollie
june
too
that
gave
him
a
thrill
of
hope
which
made
him
forget
his
cynicism
father
murray
had
put
aunt
mary
s
wrap
about
her
and
rockwell
had
got
merriam
s
hat
and
his
own
merriam
found
alicia
by
his
side
she
held
out
her
hand
and
when
he
took
it
she
squeezed
his
fingers
in
the
way
she
had
and
said
significantly
with
all
of
a
woman
s
interest
in
a
romance
good
luck
thank
you
said
merriam
but
his
answering
smile
was
again
a
little
cynical
then
he
opened
the
door
for
aunt
mary
and
waved
his
hand
to
the
others
with
some
amusement
at
the
anxious
looks
with
which
they
were
regarding
him
even
simpson
s
countenance
was
perturbed
rockwell
and
the
mayor
went
down
to
the
street
with
them
and
put
them
in
the
limousine
the
mayor
directed
the
chauffeur
to
drive
them
to
the
hotel
and
then
to
return
for
himself
and
the
others
rockwell
spoke
to
aunt
mary
you
put
the
essential
facts
before
her
and
then
leave
them
leave
merriam
to
do
the
rest
and
again
merriam
smiled
with
an
acid
amusement
that
is
commonly
supposed
to
belong
to
the
and
old
but
is
really
most
characteristic
of
those
who
are
under
thirty
rockwell
glanced
at
merriam
as
if
about
to
give
him
too
a
parting
exhortation
but
hesitated
checked
perhaps
by
the
younger
man
s
expression
and
spoke
to
the
driver
instead
all
right
they
had
started
and
merriam
tried
to
think
his
whole
life
turned
in
a
very
peculiar
sense
on
the
events
of
the
next
hour
whether
he
should
continue
to
be
himself
or
take
up
the
life
of
another
man
he
got
that
far
but
what
he
should
say
to
mollie
june
even
what
it
was
he
wanted
to
say
to
her
he
could
not
get
on
with
it
the
mood
of
youthful
cynicism
was
by
no
means
the
right
mood
for
the
business
in
hand
and
then
too
soon
for
him
now
they
were
at
the
hotel
so
little
had
he
been
able
to
think
clearly
that
it
was
not
until
he
was
helping
aunt
mary
out
of
the
machine
that
he
realised
that
in
entering
the
hotel
with
her
again
this
way
in
the
character
of
the
dead
senator
he
was
already
in
effect
consenting
to
rockwell
s
plan
and
binding
its
consequences
upon
himself
and
mollie
june
he
had
a
wild
idea
of
getting
back
into
the
limousine
and
driving
away
and
later
entering
the
hotel
via
the
fire
escape
again
but
aunt
mary
was
already
on
the
pavement
as
they
entered
the
lobby
merriam
glanced
about
to
see
whether
he
was
noticed
and
recognised
as
the
senator
he
was
at
least
three
men
whom
he
did
not
know
bowed
and
raised
their
hats
and
one
of
them
took
a
step
forward
as
if
to
approach
them
but
merriam
looked
away
and
guided
aunt
mary
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
the
elevators
when
they
emerged
on
floor
three
merriam
asked
for
the
key
explaining
casually
that
wilson
was
a
friend
in
a
couple
of
minutes
he
had
escorted
aunt
mary
to
the
door
of
her
sitting
room
senator
norman
s
no
longer
or
was
it
still
to
be
senator
norman
s
and
had
himself
entered
wilson
s
room
his
first
act
there
was
to
call
up
the
hotel
florist
as
he
had
done
once
before
on
this
same
telephone
but
this
time
merriam
s
order
was
for
roses
to
be
sent
up
at
once
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
walked
nervously
about
the
room
was
it
not
time
for
him
to
go
to
mollie
june
aunt
mary
was
being
terribly
long
about
her
explanation
had
mollie
june
broken
down
under
her
grief
grief
for
george
norman
or
merely
from
anxiety
and
conflicting
emotions
was
she
refusing
to
see
him
was
she
ill
he
jumped
up
and
walked
back
and
forth
in
his
nervousness
watching
the
door
to
the
other
bedroom
at
which
he
might
expect
to
receive
aunt
mary
s
summons
a
knock
at
last
but
it
was
at
the
wrong
door
the
hall
door
in
a
sort
of
hesitating
amazement
he
went
to
answer
it
it
was
the
boy
with
the
roses
he
had
forgotten
ordering
them
he
signed
for
the
flowers
and
brought
them
into
the
room
and
took
them
out
of
their
box
and
tissue
paper
they
were
lovely
the
most
exquisite
colour
between
pink
and
red
that
has
no
name
but
that
of
the
flower
itself
pink
and
red
harmonised
in
soft
coolness
and
fragrance
mollie
june
s
flowers
without
a
doubt
but
had
he
done
well
in
ordering
them
was
this
a
time
for
gifts
should
he
not
have
got
white
roses
such
as
one
sends
to
a
funeral
and
then
as
he
stood
in
this
anxiety
came
aunt
mary
s
knock
at
the
bedroom
door
he
started
as
if
caught
in
a
guilty
action
and
thrust
the
flowers
back
into
their
box
before
he
went
to
open
to
her
how
is
she
but
aunt
mary
herself
looked
so
broken
that
he
led
her
to
a
chair
then
how
is
she
he
repeated
he
could
not
wait
she
is
very
quiet
you
told
her
the
the
plan
yes
she
understood
it
i
think
so
am
i
to
go
to
her
i
suppose
so
said
aunt
mary
with
a
sigh
rockwell
said
she
stopped
merriam
showed
her
the
roses
should
i
take
these
to
her
aunt
mary
looked
at
him
and
at
the
flowers
i
think
perhaps
you
might
she
said
and
then
sat
staring
out
across
the
fire
escape
she
looked
so
very
miserable
that
merriam
impulsively
patted
her
shoulder
she
glanced
up
quickly
at
that
then
turned
her
eyes
to
the
window
again
he
could
not
read
her
look
but
he
was
not
sorry
he
had
betrayed
his
affectionate
sympathy
if
he
was
to
be
her
brother
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
after
a
moment
more
of
hesitation
he
picked
up
the
flowers
and
passed
through
the
former
sick
room
to
the
sitting
room
mollie
june
was
sitting
in
a
small
chair
by
the
window
looking
out
but
merriam
was
sure
at
the
first
glance
that
she
saw
nothing
she
had
merely
turned
automatically
towards
the
light
as
all
but
the
old
or
the
tend
to
do
as
aunt
mary
had
said
she
was
very
quiet
her
back
was
of
course
towards
the
room
and
merriam
he
waited
for
a
moment
just
inside
the
door
looking
at
her
forgetting
the
flowers
in
his
hands
he
was
sorry
for
her
and
very
uncertain
what
he
ought
to
do
then
he
became
a
little
frightened
because
she
sat
so
still
she
gave
no
sign
of
having
heard
him
with
conscious
effort
because
he
must
do
something
he
crossed
the
room
till
he
stood
beside
her
still
she
did
not
turn
her
eyes
from
the
window
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
she
was
a
pathetic
figure
as
she
sat
there
the
more
pathetic
to
the
eyes
of
youth
at
least
because
she
was
so
lovely
so
young
and
fresh
really
although
a
little
pale
and
he
saw
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
which
must
have
come
from
tears
the
sight
of
these
unlocked
him
drowned
all
his
hesitations
in
pitying
love
he
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
her
chair
laying
the
roses
regardlessly
on
the
floor
and
putting
one
hand
on
the
back
of
her
chair
mollie
june
he
said
she
did
not
start
evidently
she
had
known
he
was
there
she
looked
first
at
the
flowers
on
the
floor
and
then
at
his
face
i
am
so
sorry
he
cried
are
you
sorry
or
glad
she
asked
i
am
terribly
sorry
for
you
he
answered
her
hands
lay
together
in
her
lap
and
he
attempted
to
take
one
of
them
but
she
moved
them
slightly
don
t
she
said
don
t
make
me
strange
to
you
mollie
june
he
cried
how
can
i
help
it
she
answered
i
am
strange
to
myself
too
you
see
i
am
glad
i
am
sorry
for
george
she
went
on
quickly
it
is
terrible
to
me
that
he
is
dead
but
i
am
so
glad
i
do
not
have
to
be
his
wife
any
more
once
more
as
on
a
former
occasion
some
dim
notion
came
to
merriam
of
what
it
must
mean
to
a
girl
to
be
connubially
in
the
power
of
a
man
she
does
not
love
he
pitied
and
loved
her
greatly
also
he
marvelled
how
had
she
come
through
it
all
so
fresh
and
unchanged
the
answer
of
course
was
youth
but
youth
could
not
know
the
answer
i
am
glad
too
he
said
her
eyes
which
as
she
dropped
them
had
rested
on
the
roses
on
the
floor
came
back
to
his
face
you
are
glad
i
have
to
marry
you
but
you
don
t
you
know
i
do
instantly
he
saw
that
aunt
mary
had
not
put
the
thing
fairly
before
her
in
aunt
mary
s
mind
it
was
settled
the
course
of
action
which
promised
to
save
the
precious
norman
name
from
scandal
was
the
only
possible
course
of
action
she
had
so
represented
it
to
mollie
june
no
no
merriam
cried
you
shall
not
be
forced
into
this
you
shall
never
be
forced
in
anything
again
if
i
can
help
it
i
will
not
be
forced
myself
even
to
marry
you
what
else
can
we
do
asked
mollie
june
searching
his
face
it
s
fairly
simple
he
said
a
little
bitterly
not
easy
but
simple
i
will
write
a
brief
plain
account
of
the
whole
affair
the
impersonation
from
beginning
to
end
and
send
for
a
reporter
and
give
it
to
him
that
will
end
everything
i
will
sit
down
now
at
that
desk
and
write
it
and
call
for
a
man
and
give
it
to
him
while
aunt
mary
thinks
we
are
still
talking
unless
you
tell
me
not
to
would
you
do
that
indeed
i
will
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
meant
it
and
she
saw
that
he
meant
it
to
be
forced
in
this
thing
was
in
fact
even
less
to
his
liking
perhaps
than
to
hers
standing
he
saw
the
roses
at
his
feet
he
stooped
and
picked
them
up
and
handed
them
to
her
you
ll
let
me
give
you
these
he
said
his
manner
more
determined
than
i
saw
them
from
the
elevator
as
i
was
coming
up
here
with
aunt
mary
they
were
so
like
you
that
i
could
not
help
buying
them
and
bringing
them
to
you
she
accepted
them
passively
looking
up
at
him
perhaps
she
liked
him
determined
rather
than
i
am
not
giving
you
up
he
went
on
gravely
but
you
will
go
away
somewhere
with
aunt
mary
and
i
will
go
back
to
riceville
i
have
my
contract
for
the
rest
of
this
year
at
least
and
if
you
will
wait
a
few
years
you
will
want
to
wait
and
rest
a
while
i
will
come
back
and
win
you
in
my
own
right
she
did
not
answer
but
looked
up
at
him
still
searching
his
face
for
a
moment
he
stood
regarding
her
that
image
of
her
as
she
sat
there
with
the
flowers
in
her
lap
and
her
uplifted
face
and
questioning
eyes
more
lovely
than
ever
in
their
intense
gravity
in
spite
of
their
trace
of
tears
remained
one
of
the
permanent
treasures
of
his
memory
he
turned
away
and
walked
over
to
the
writing
table
and
sat
down
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
he
could
think
why
he
was
there
then
he
remembered
and
drew
towards
him
several
sheets
of
the
hotel
stationery
and
took
up
a
pen
he
realised
that
he
was
in
a
very
poor
frame
of
mind
for
literary
composition
but
he
mastered
his
attention
and
wrote
by
john
merriam
regarding
his
impersonation
of
senator
he
underlined
those
words
and
resisted
an
impulse
to
turn
and
look
at
mollie
june
he
wanted
to
know
whether
she
was
looking
at
him
or
looking
out
at
the
window
again
he
wanted
too
merely
to
see
her
but
he
would
not
look
with
a
heroic
effort
he
brought
his
mind
back
to
the
paper
before
him
how
to
begin
where
to
begin
it
was
a
long
story
he
realised
he
must
make
it
as
brief
as
possible
he
could
omit
much
but
he
must
introduce
himself
the
public
did
not
know
him
from
adam
he
seized
at
this
straw
my
name
is
john
merriam
he
wrote
i
am
the
principal
of
the
high
school
at
riceville
illinois
on
my
mother
s
side
i
am
related
to
he
stopped
abruptly
it
was
the
fragrance
of
roses
that
interrupted
him
mollie
june
had
risen
and
come
over
beside
him
his
effort
of
concentration
had
been
so
great
that
he
had
not
heard
her
she
carried
the
flowers
pressed
against
the
bosom
of
her
dress
the
action
was
probably
mechanical
she
was
too
much
engrossed
to
think
to
put
them
down
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
over
his
shoulder
at
his
writing
she
read
it
apparently
his
opening
statement
caught
her
attention
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
slightly
more
with
her
mouth
than
her
eyes
which
were
still
grave
you
wouldn
t
like
to
change
your
name
would
you
she
said
mollie
june
he
was
on
his
feet
she
backed
away
from
him
pressing
her
flowers
tight
would
you
she
demanded
it
s
not
that
he
said
not
daring
to
advance
towards
her
lest
she
should
retreat
farther
a
woman
always
has
to
change
her
name
when
she
marries
why
shouldn
t
a
man
do
it
for
once
he
started
forward
now
and
caught
her
arm
and
led
her
back
to
her
chair
and
dropped
on
his
knees
again
beside
her
dearest
mollie
june
he
said
i
ll
change
my
name
to
yours
so
gladly
if
you
will
let
me
so
as
to
have
you
sooner
than
i
could
the
other
way
but
not
unless
you
want
me
to
he
added
fiercely
for
yourself
she
looked
at
him
shyly
now
i
would
rather
have
it
the
other
way
myself
she
said
tears
standing
in
her
eyes
at
last
and
wait
and
change
my
name
to
yours
but
i
think
we
ought
to
do
it
this
way
for
george
for
george
yes
and
aunt
mary
she
has
been
very
good
to
me
george
was
good
to
me
too
in
his
way
and
he
was
my
husband
and
he
s
dead
if
we
can
save
his
name
and
save
her
this
way
don
t
you
think
we
ought
to
then
of
course
he
put
his
arms
about
her
i
won
t
call
you
george
though
she
said
presently
very
emphatically
what
will
you
call
me
dearest
she
smiled
at
him
through
her
tears
and
with
a
gesture
that
ravished
him
lifted
his
hand
and
kissed
it
mr
john
she
whispered
he
would
have
kissed
her
again
but
she
hurried
on
we
ll
pretend
to
people
that
it
s
a
nickname
left
over
from
some
game
or
play
it
left
over
from
a
sort
of
play
he
answered
and
then
she
was
ready
for
another
kiss
the
end
