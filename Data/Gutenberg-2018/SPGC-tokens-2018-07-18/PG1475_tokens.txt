to
know
how
to
sell
to
be
able
to
sell
and
to
sell
people
generally
do
not
suspect
how
much
of
the
stateliness
of
paris
is
due
to
these
three
aspects
of
the
same
problem
the
brilliant
display
of
shops
as
rich
as
the
salons
of
the
noblesse
before
the
splendors
of
cafes
which
eclipse
and
easily
eclipse
the
versailles
of
our
day
the
illusions
new
every
morning
nightly
destroyed
the
grace
and
elegance
of
the
young
men
that
come
in
contact
with
fair
customers
the
piquant
faces
and
costumes
of
young
damsels
who
can
not
fail
to
attract
the
masculine
customer
and
and
this
especially
of
late
the
length
the
vast
spaces
the
babylonish
luxury
of
galleries
where
shopkeepers
acquire
a
monopoly
of
the
trade
in
various
articles
by
bringing
them
all
together
all
this
is
as
nothing
everything
so
far
has
been
done
to
appeal
to
a
single
sense
and
that
the
most
exacting
and
jaded
human
faculty
a
faculty
developed
ever
since
the
days
of
the
roman
empire
until
in
our
own
times
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
the
most
fastidious
civilization
the
world
has
yet
seen
its
demands
are
grown
limitless
that
faculty
resides
in
the
eyes
of
paris
those
eyes
require
illuminations
costing
a
hundred
thousand
francs
and
glass
palaces
a
couple
of
miles
long
and
sixty
feet
high
they
must
have
a
fairyland
at
some
fourteen
theatres
every
night
and
a
succession
of
panoramas
and
exhibitions
of
the
triumphs
of
art
for
them
a
whole
world
of
suffering
and
pain
and
a
universe
of
joy
must
resolve
through
the
boulevards
or
stray
through
the
streets
of
paris
for
them
encyclopaedias
of
carnival
frippery
and
a
score
of
illustrated
books
are
brought
out
every
year
to
say
nothing
of
caricatures
by
the
hundred
and
vignettes
lithographs
and
prints
by
the
thousand
to
please
those
eyes
fifteen
thousand
francs
worth
of
gas
must
blaze
every
night
and
to
conclude
for
their
delectation
the
great
city
yearly
spends
several
millions
of
francs
in
opening
up
views
and
planting
trees
and
even
yet
this
is
as
nothing
it
is
only
the
material
side
of
the
question
in
truth
a
mere
trifle
compared
with
the
expenditure
of
brain
power
on
the
shifts
worthy
of
moliere
invented
by
some
sixty
thousand
assistants
and
forty
thousand
damsels
of
the
counter
who
fasten
upon
the
customer
purse
much
as
myriads
of
seine
whitebait
fall
upon
a
chance
crust
floating
down
the
river
gaudissart
in
the
mart
is
at
least
the
equal
of
his
illustrious
namesake
now
become
the
typical
commercial
traveler
take
him
away
from
his
shop
and
his
line
of
business
he
is
like
a
collapsed
balloon
only
among
his
bales
of
merchandise
do
his
faculties
return
much
as
an
actor
is
sublime
only
upon
the
boards
a
french
shopman
is
better
educated
than
his
fellows
in
other
european
countries
he
can
at
need
talk
asphalt
bal
mabille
polkas
literature
illustrated
books
railways
politics
parliament
and
revolution
transplant
him
take
away
his
stage
his
yardstick
his
artificial
graces
he
is
foolish
beyond
belief
but
on
his
own
boards
on
the
of
the
counter
as
he
displays
a
shawl
with
a
speech
at
his
tongue
end
and
his
eye
on
his
customer
he
puts
the
great
talleyrand
into
the
shade
he
is
a
match
for
a
monrose
and
a
moliere
to
boot
talleyrand
in
his
own
house
would
have
outwitted
gaudissart
but
in
the
shop
the
parts
would
have
been
reversed
an
incident
will
illustrate
the
paradox
two
charming
duchesses
were
chatting
with
the
great
diplomatist
the
ladies
wished
for
a
bracelet
they
were
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
a
man
from
a
great
parisian
jeweler
a
gaudissart
accordingly
appeared
with
three
bracelets
of
marvelous
workmanship
the
great
ladies
hesitated
choice
is
a
mental
lightning
flash
hesitate
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
you
are
at
fault
inspiration
in
matters
of
taste
will
not
come
twice
at
last
after
about
ten
minutes
the
prince
was
called
in
he
saw
the
two
duchesses
confronting
doubt
with
its
thousand
facets
unable
to
decide
between
the
transcendent
merits
of
two
of
the
trinkets
for
the
third
had
been
set
aside
at
once
without
leaving
his
book
without
a
glance
at
the
bracelets
the
prince
looked
at
the
assistant
which
would
you
choose
for
your
sweetheart
asked
he
the
young
man
indicated
one
of
the
pair
in
that
case
take
the
other
you
will
make
two
women
happy
said
the
subtlest
of
modern
diplomatists
and
make
your
sweetheart
happy
too
in
my
name
the
two
fair
ladies
smiled
and
the
young
shopman
took
his
departure
delighted
with
the
prince
present
and
the
implied
compliment
to
his
taste
a
woman
alights
from
her
splendid
carriage
before
one
of
the
expensive
shops
where
shawls
are
sold
in
the
rue
vivienne
she
is
not
alone
women
almost
always
go
in
pairs
on
these
expeditions
always
make
the
round
of
half
a
score
of
shops
before
they
make
up
their
minds
and
laugh
together
in
the
intervals
over
the
little
comedies
played
for
their
benefit
let
us
see
which
of
the
two
acts
most
in
character
the
fair
customer
or
the
seller
and
which
has
the
best
of
it
in
such
miniature
vaudevilles
if
you
attempt
to
describe
a
sale
the
central
fact
of
parisian
trade
you
are
in
duty
bound
if
you
attempt
to
give
the
gist
of
the
matter
to
produce
a
type
and
for
this
purpose
a
shawl
or
a
chatelaine
costing
some
three
thousand
francs
is
a
more
exacting
purchase
than
a
length
of
lawn
or
dress
that
costs
three
hundred
but
know
oh
foreign
visitors
from
the
old
world
and
the
new
if
ever
this
study
of
the
physiology
of
the
invoice
should
be
by
you
perused
that
this
selfsame
comedy
is
played
in
haberdashers
shops
over
a
barege
at
two
francs
or
a
printed
muslin
at
four
francs
the
yard
and
you
princess
or
simple
citizen
wife
whichever
you
may
be
how
should
you
distrust
that
very
young
man
with
those
frank
innocent
eyes
and
a
cheek
like
a
peach
covered
with
down
he
is
dressed
almost
as
well
as
your
cousin
let
us
say
his
tones
are
soft
as
the
woolen
stuffs
which
he
spreads
before
you
there
are
three
or
four
more
of
his
like
one
has
dark
eyes
a
decided
expression
and
an
imperial
manner
of
saying
this
is
what
you
wish
another
that
youth
diffident
of
manner
and
meek
of
speech
prompts
the
remark
poor
boy
he
was
not
born
for
business
a
third
with
light
auburn
hair
and
laughing
tawny
eyes
has
all
the
lively
humor
and
activity
and
gaiety
of
the
south
while
the
fourth
he
of
the
tawny
red
hair
and
beard
is
rough
as
a
communist
with
his
portentous
cravat
his
sternness
his
dignity
and
curt
speech
these
varieties
of
shopmen
corresponding
to
the
principal
types
of
feminine
customers
are
arms
as
it
were
directed
by
the
head
a
stout
personage
with
a
countenance
a
partially
bald
forehead
and
a
chest
measure
befitting
a
ministerialist
deputy
occasionally
this
person
wears
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
in
recognition
of
the
manner
in
which
he
supports
the
dignity
of
the
french
drapers
wand
from
the
comfortable
curves
of
his
figure
you
can
see
that
he
has
a
wife
and
family
a
country
house
and
an
account
with
the
bank
of
france
he
descends
like
a
ex
whenever
a
tangled
problem
demands
a
swift
solution
the
feminine
purchasers
are
surrounded
on
all
sides
with
urbanity
youth
pleasant
manners
smiles
and
jests
the
most
human
products
of
civilization
are
here
all
sorted
in
shades
to
suit
all
tastes
just
one
word
as
to
the
natural
effects
of
architecture
optical
science
and
house
decoration
one
short
decisive
terrible
word
of
history
made
on
the
spot
the
work
which
contains
this
instructive
page
is
sold
at
number
rue
de
richelieu
where
above
an
elegant
shop
all
white
and
gold
and
crimson
velvet
there
is
an
entresol
into
which
the
light
pours
straight
from
the
rue
de
menars
as
into
a
studio
clean
clear
even
daylight
what
idler
in
the
streets
has
not
beheld
the
persian
that
asiatic
potentate
ruffling
it
above
the
door
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
bourse
and
the
rue
de
richelieu
with
a
message
to
deliver
et
here
i
reign
more
tranquilly
than
at
lahore
perhaps
but
for
this
immortal
analytical
study
archaeologists
might
begin
to
puzzle
their
heads
about
him
five
hundred
years
hence
and
set
about
writing
quartos
with
plates
like
quatremere
work
on
olympian
jove
to
prove
that
napoleon
was
something
of
a
sofi
in
the
east
before
he
became
emperor
of
the
french
well
the
wealthy
shop
laid
siege
to
the
poor
little
entresol
and
after
a
bombardment
with
banknotes
entered
and
took
possession
the
human
comedy
gave
way
before
the
comedy
of
cashmeres
the
persian
sacrificed
a
diamond
or
two
from
his
crown
to
buy
that
so
necessary
daylight
for
a
ray
of
sunlight
shows
the
play
of
the
colors
brings
out
the
charms
of
a
shawl
and
doubles
its
value
is
an
irresistible
light
literally
a
golden
ray
from
this
fact
you
may
judge
how
far
paris
shops
are
arranged
with
a
view
to
effect
but
to
return
to
the
young
assistants
to
the
beribboned
man
of
forty
whom
the
king
of
the
french
receives
at
his
table
to
the
head
of
the
department
with
his
autocrat
air
week
by
week
these
meritus
gaudissarts
are
brought
in
contact
with
whims
past
counting
they
know
every
vibration
of
the
cashmere
chord
in
the
heart
of
woman
no
one
be
she
lady
or
lorette
a
young
mother
of
a
family
a
respectable
tradesman
wife
a
woman
of
easy
virtue
a
duchess
or
a
an
innocent
young
girl
or
a
too
innocent
foreigner
can
appear
in
the
shop
but
she
is
watched
from
the
moment
when
she
first
lays
her
fingers
upon
the
her
measure
is
taken
at
a
glance
by
seven
or
eight
men
that
stand
in
the
windows
at
the
counter
by
the
door
in
a
corner
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
meditating
to
all
appearance
on
the
joys
of
a
bacchanalian
sunday
holiday
as
you
look
at
them
you
ask
yourself
involuntarily
what
can
they
be
thinking
about
well
in
the
space
of
one
second
a
purse
wishes
intentions
and
whims
are
ransacked
more
thoroughly
than
a
traveling
carriage
at
a
frontier
in
an
hour
and
nothing
is
lost
on
these
intelligent
rogues
as
they
stand
solemn
as
noble
fathers
on
the
stage
they
take
in
all
the
details
of
a
fair
customer
dress
an
invisible
speck
of
mud
on
a
little
shoe
an
antiquated
soiled
or
the
fashion
of
the
dress
the
age
of
a
pair
of
gloves
they
can
tell
whether
the
gown
was
cut
by
the
intelligent
scissors
of
a
victorine
iv
they
know
a
modish
gewgaw
or
a
trinket
from
nothing
in
short
which
can
reveal
a
woman
quality
fortune
or
character
passes
unremarked
tremble
before
them
never
was
the
sanhedrim
of
gaudissarts
with
their
chief
at
their
head
known
to
make
a
mistake
and
moreover
they
communicate
their
conclusions
to
one
another
with
telegraphic
speed
in
a
glance
a
smile
the
movement
of
a
muscle
a
twitch
of
the
lip
if
you
watch
them
you
are
reminded
of
the
sudden
outbreak
of
light
along
the
at
dusk
one
does
not
succeed
another
more
swiftly
than
an
idea
flashes
from
one
shopman
eyes
to
the
next
at
once
if
the
lady
is
english
the
dark
mysterious
portentous
gaudissart
advances
like
a
romantic
character
out
of
one
of
poems
if
she
is
a
city
madam
the
oldest
is
put
forward
he
brings
out
a
hundred
shawls
in
fifteen
minutes
he
turns
her
head
with
colors
and
patterns
every
shawl
that
he
shows
her
is
like
a
circle
described
by
a
kite
wheeling
round
a
hapless
rabbit
till
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
when
her
head
is
swimming
and
she
is
utterly
incapable
of
making
a
decision
for
herself
the
good
lady
meeting
with
a
flattering
response
to
all
her
ideas
refers
the
question
to
the
assistant
who
promptly
leaves
her
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
between
two
equally
irresistible
shawls
this
madame
is
very
becoming
the
color
of
the
season
still
fashions
change
while
as
for
this
other
shawl
an
opportunity
not
to
be
missed
you
will
never
see
the
end
of
it
and
it
will
go
with
any
dress
this
is
the
a
b
c
of
the
trade
you
would
not
believe
how
much
eloquence
is
wanted
in
that
beastly
line
the
head
gaudissart
of
this
particular
establishment
remarked
quite
lately
to
two
acquaintances
duronceret
and
bixiou
who
had
come
trusting
in
his
judgment
to
buy
a
shawl
look
here
you
are
artists
and
discreet
i
can
tell
you
about
the
governor
tricks
and
of
all
the
men
i
ever
saw
he
is
the
cleverest
i
do
not
mean
as
a
manufacturer
there
fritot
is
first
but
as
a
salesman
he
discovered
the
shawl
absolutely
article
yet
we
never
bring
it
out
but
we
sell
it
we
keep
always
a
shawl
worth
five
or
six
hundred
francs
in
a
box
perfectly
plain
outside
but
lined
with
satin
it
is
one
of
the
shawls
that
selim
sent
to
the
emperor
napoleon
it
is
our
imperial
guard
it
is
brought
to
the
front
whenever
the
day
is
almost
lost
se
vend
et
ne
meurt
it
sells
its
life
dearly
time
after
time
as
he
spoke
an
englishwoman
stepped
from
her
jobbed
carriage
and
appeared
in
all
the
glory
of
that
phlegmatic
humor
peculiar
to
britain
and
to
all
its
products
which
make
believe
they
are
alive
the
apparition
put
you
in
mind
of
the
commandant
statue
in
don
juan
it
walked
along
jerkily
by
fits
and
starts
in
an
awkward
fashion
invented
in
london
and
cultivated
in
every
family
with
patriotic
care
an
englishwoman
he
continued
for
bixiou
ear
an
englishwoman
is
our
waterloo
there
are
women
who
slip
through
our
fingers
like
eels
we
catch
them
on
the
staircase
there
are
lorettes
who
chaff
us
we
join
in
the
laugh
we
have
a
hold
on
them
because
we
give
credit
there
are
foreign
ladies
we
take
a
quantity
of
shawls
to
their
houses
and
arrive
at
an
understanding
by
flattery
but
an
englishwoman
you
might
as
well
attack
the
bronze
statue
of
louis
quatorze
that
sort
of
woman
turns
shopping
into
an
occupation
an
amusement
she
quizzes
us
forsooth
the
romantic
assistant
came
to
the
front
does
madame
wish
for
real
indian
shawls
or
french
something
expensive
or
i
will
see
how
much
would
madame
propose
i
will
see
the
shopman
went
in
quest
of
shawls
to
spread
upon
the
giving
his
colleagues
a
significant
glance
what
a
bore
he
said
plainly
with
an
almost
imperceptible
shrug
of
the
shoulders
these
are
our
best
quality
in
indian
red
blue
and
pale
orange
all
at
ten
thousand
francs
here
are
shawls
at
five
thousand
francs
and
others
at
three
the
englishwoman
took
up
her
eyeglass
and
looked
round
the
room
with
gloomy
indifference
then
she
submitted
the
three
stands
to
the
same
scrutiny
and
made
no
sign
have
you
any
more
demanded
she
yes
madame
but
perhaps
madame
has
not
quite
decided
to
take
a
shawl
oh
quite
decided
the
young
man
went
in
search
of
cheaper
wares
these
he
spread
out
solemnly
as
if
they
were
things
of
price
saying
by
his
manner
pay
attention
to
all
this
magnificence
these
are
much
more
expensive
said
he
they
have
never
been
worn
they
have
come
by
courier
direct
from
the
manufacturers
at
lahore
oh
i
see
said
she
they
are
much
more
like
the
thing
i
want
the
shopman
kept
his
countenance
in
spite
of
inward
irritation
which
communicated
itself
to
duronceret
and
bixiou
the
englishwoman
cool
as
a
cucumber
appeared
to
rejoice
in
her
phlegmatic
humor
what
price
she
asked
indicating
a
shawl
covered
with
a
pattern
of
birds
nestling
in
pagodas
seven
thousand
francs
she
took
it
up
wrapped
it
about
her
shoulders
looked
in
the
glass
and
handed
it
back
again
no
i
do
not
like
it
at
all
a
long
quarter
of
an
hour
went
by
in
trying
on
other
shawls
to
no
purpose
this
is
all
we
have
madame
said
the
assistant
glancing
at
the
master
as
he
spoke
madame
is
fastidious
like
all
persons
of
taste
said
the
head
of
the
establishment
coming
forward
with
that
tradesman
suavity
in
which
pomposity
is
agreeably
blended
with
subservience
the
englishwoman
took
up
her
eyeglass
and
scanned
the
manufacturer
from
head
to
foot
unwilling
to
understand
that
the
man
before
her
was
eligible
for
parliament
and
dined
at
the
tuileries
i
have
only
one
shawl
left
he
continued
but
i
never
show
it
it
is
not
to
everybody
taste
it
is
quite
out
of
the
common
i
was
thinking
of
giving
it
to
my
wife
we
have
had
it
in
stock
since
it
belonged
to
the
empress
josephine
let
me
see
it
monsieur
go
for
it
said
the
master
turning
to
a
shopman
it
is
at
my
house
i
should
be
very
much
pleased
to
see
it
said
the
english
lady
this
was
a
triumph
the
splenetic
dame
was
apparently
on
the
point
of
going
she
made
as
though
she
saw
nothing
but
the
shawls
but
all
the
while
she
furtively
watched
the
shopmen
and
the
two
customers
sheltering
her
eyes
behind
the
rims
of
her
eyeglasses
it
cost
sixty
thousand
francs
in
turkey
madame
oh
it
is
one
of
seven
shawls
which
selim
sent
before
his
fall
to
the
emperor
napoleon
the
empress
josephine
a
creole
as
you
know
my
lady
and
very
capricious
in
her
tastes
exchanged
this
one
for
another
brought
by
the
turkish
ambassador
and
purchased
by
my
predecessor
but
i
have
never
seen
the
money
back
our
ladies
in
france
are
not
rich
enough
it
is
not
as
it
is
in
england
the
shawl
is
worth
seven
thousand
francs
and
taking
interest
and
compound
interest
altogether
it
makes
up
fourteen
or
fifteen
thousand
by
now
how
does
it
make
up
asked
the
englishwoman
here
it
is
madame
with
precautions
which
a
custodian
of
the
dresden
might
have
admired
he
took
out
an
infinitesimal
key
and
opened
a
square
box
the
englishwoman
was
much
impressed
with
its
shape
and
plainness
from
that
box
lined
with
black
satin
he
drew
a
shawl
worth
about
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
black
pattern
on
a
ground
of
which
the
startling
color
was
only
surpassed
by
the
surprising
efforts
of
the
indian
imagination
splendid
said
the
lady
in
a
mixture
of
french
and
english
it
is
really
handsome
just
my
ideal
of
a
shawl
it
is
very
magnificent
the
rest
was
lost
in
a
madonna
pose
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
displaying
a
pair
of
frigid
eyes
which
she
believed
to
be
very
fine
it
was
a
great
favorite
with
the
emperor
napoleon
he
took
a
great
favorite
repeated
she
with
her
english
accent
then
she
arranged
the
shawl
about
her
shoulders
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
the
proprietor
took
it
to
the
light
gathered
it
up
in
his
hands
smoothed
it
out
showed
the
gloss
on
it
played
on
it
as
liszt
plays
on
the
pianoforte
keys
it
is
very
fine
beautiful
sweet
said
the
lady
as
composedly
as
possible
duronceret
bixiou
and
the
shopmen
exchanged
amused
glances
the
shawl
is
sold
they
thought
well
madame
inquired
the
proprietor
as
the
englishwoman
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
meditations
infinitely
prolonged
decidedly
said
she
i
would
rather
have
a
carriage
all
the
assistants
listening
with
silent
rapt
attention
started
as
one
man
as
if
an
electric
shock
had
gone
through
them
i
have
a
very
handsome
one
madame
said
the
proprietor
with
unshaken
composure
it
belonged
to
a
russian
princess
the
princess
narzicof
she
left
it
with
me
in
payment
for
goods
received
if
madame
would
like
to
see
it
she
would
be
astonished
it
is
new
it
has
not
been
in
use
altogether
for
ten
days
there
is
not
its
like
in
paris
the
shopmen
amazement
was
suppressed
by
profound
admiration
i
am
quite
willing
if
madame
will
keep
the
shawl
suggested
the
proprietor
she
can
try
the
effect
in
the
carriage
and
he
went
for
his
hat
and
gloves
how
will
this
end
asked
the
head
assistant
as
he
watched
his
employer
offer
an
arm
to
the
english
lady
and
go
down
with
her
to
the
jobbed
brougham
by
this
time
the
thing
had
come
to
be
as
exciting
as
the
last
chapter
of
a
novel
for
duronceret
and
bixiou
even
without
the
additional
interest
attached
to
all
contests
however
trifling
between
england
and
france
twenty
minutes
later
the
proprietor
returned
go
to
the
hotel
lawson
here
is
the
card
noswell
and
take
an
invoice
that
i
will
give
you
there
are
six
thousand
francs
to
take
how
did
you
do
it
asked
duronceret
bowing
before
the
king
of
invoices
oh
i
saw
what
she
was
an
eccentric
woman
that
loves
to
be
conspicuous
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
every
one
stared
at
her
she
said
your
carriage
monsieur
my
mind
is
made
up
i
will
take
the
shawl
while
bigorneau
indicating
the
assistant
was
serving
i
watched
her
carefully
she
kept
one
eye
on
you
all
the
time
to
see
what
you
thought
of
her
she
was
thinking
more
about
you
than
of
the
shawls
englishwomen
are
peculiar
in
their
for
one
can
not
call
it
taste
they
do
not
know
what
they
want
they
make
up
their
minds
to
be
guided
by
circumstances
at
the
time
and
not
by
their
own
choice
i
saw
the
kind
of
woman
at
once
tired
of
her
husband
tired
of
her
brats
regretfully
virtuous
craving
excitement
always
posing
as
a
weeping
willow
these
were
his
very
words
which
proves
that
in
all
other
countries
of
the
world
a
shopkeeper
is
a
shopkeeper
while
in
france
and
in

more

he
