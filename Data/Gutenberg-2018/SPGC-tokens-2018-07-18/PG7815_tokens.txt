the
last
of
the
english
prelude
the
heroic
deeds
of
highlanders
both
in
these
islands
and
elsewhere
have
been
told
in
verse
and
prose
and
not
more
often
nor
more
loudly
than
they
deserve
but
we
must
remember
now
and
then
that
there
have
been
heroes
likewise
in
the
lowland
and
in
the
fen
why
however
poets
have
so
seldom
sung
of
them
why
no
historian
save
motley
in
his
rise
of
the
dutch
republic
has
condescended
to
tell
the
tale
of
their
doughty
deeds
is
a
question
not
difficult
to
answer
in
the
first
place
they
have
been
fewer
in
number
the
lowlands
of
the
world
being
the
richest
spots
have
been
generally
the
soonest
conquered
the
soonest
civilized
and
therefore
the
soonest
taken
out
of
the
sphere
of
romance
and
wild
adventure
into
that
of
order
and
law
hard
work
and
common
sense
as
well
as
too
often
into
the
sphere
of
slavery
cowardice
luxury
and
ignoble
greed
the
lowland
populations
for
the
same
reasons
have
been
generally
the
first
to
deteriorate
though
not
on
account
of
the
vices
of
civilization
the
vices
of
incivilization
are
far
worse
and
far
more
destructive
of
human
life
and
it
is
just
because
they
are
so
that
rude
tribes
deteriorate
physically
less
than
polished
nations
in
the
savage
struggle
for
life
none
but
the
strongest
healthiest
cunningest
have
a
chance
of
living
prospering
and
propagating
their
race
in
the
civilized
state
on
the
contrary
the
weakliest
and
the
silliest
protected
by
law
religion
and
humanity
have
chance
likewise
and
transmit
to
their
offspring
their
own
weakliness
or
silliness
in
these
islands
for
instance
at
the
time
of
the
norman
conquest
the
average
of
man
was
doubtless
superior
both
in
body
and
mind
to
the
average
of
man
now
simply
because
the
weaklings
could
not
have
lived
at
all
and
the
rich
and
delicate
beauty
in
which
the
women
of
the
eastern
counties
still
surpass
all
other
races
in
these
isles
was
doubtless
far
more
common
in
proportion
to
the
numbers
of
the
population
another
reason
and
one
which
every
scot
will
understand
why
lowland
heroes
carent
vate
sacro
is
that
the
lowlands
and
those
who
live
in
them
are
wanting
in
the
poetic
and
romantic
elements
there
is
in
the
lowland
none
of
that
background
of
the
unknown
fantastic
magical
terrible
perpetually
feeding
curiosity
and
wonder
which
still
remains
in
the
scottish
highlands
which
when
it
disappears
from
thence
will
remain
embalmed
forever
in
the
pages
of
walter
scott
against
that
background
his
heroes
stand
out
in
vivid
relief
and
justly
so
it
was
not
put
there
by
him
for
stage
purposes
it
was
there
as
a
fact
and
the
men
of
whom
he
wrote
were
conscious
of
it
were
moulded
by
it
were
not
ashamed
of
its
influence
nature
among
the
mountains
is
too
fierce
too
strong
for
man
he
can
not
conquer
her
and
she
awes
him
he
can
not
dig
down
the
cliffs
or
chain
the
and
his
fear
of
them
takes
bodily
shape
he
begins
to
people
the
weird
places
of
the
earth
with
weird
beings
and
sees
nixes
in
the
dark
linns
as
he
fishes
by
night
dwarfs
in
the
caves
where
he
digs
morsels
of
copper
and
iron
for
his
weapons
witches
and
demons
on
the
which
overwhelms
his
herd
and
his
hut
and
in
the
dark
clouds
which
brood
on
the
untrodden
he
lives
in
fear
and
yet
if
he
be
a
man
his
fears
do
him
little
harm
they
may
break
out
at
times
in
with
all
their
horrible
suspicions
and
thus
breed
cruelty
which
is
the
child
of
fear
but
on
the
whole
they
rather
produce
in
man
thoughtfulness
reverence
a
sense
confused
yet
precious
of
the
boundless
importance
of
the
unseen
world
his
superstitions
develop
his
imagination
the
moving
accidents
of
a
wild
life
call
out
in
him
sympathy
and
pathos
and
the
mountaineer
becomes
instinctively
a
poet
the
lowlander
on
the
other
hand
has
his
own
strength
his
own
virtues
or
manfulnesses
in
the
good
old
sense
of
the
word
but
they
are
not
for
the
most
part
picturesque
or
even
poetical
he
finds
out
soon
enough
for
his
weal
and
his
bane
that
he
is
stronger
than
nature
and
right
tyrannously
and
irreverently
he
lords
it
over
her
clearing
delving
diking
building
without
fear
or
shame
he
knows
of
no
natural
force
greater
than
himself
save
an
occasional
and
against
that
as
he
grows
more
cunning
he
insures
his
crops
why
should
he
reverence
nature
let
him
use
her
and
eat
one
can
not
blame
him
man
was
sent
into
the
world
so
says
the
scripture
to
fill
and
subdue
the
earth
but
he
was
sent
into
the
world
for
other
purposes
which
the
lowlander
is
but
too
apt
to
forget
with
the
awe
of
nature
the
awe
of
the
unseen
dies
out
in
him
meeting
with
no
visible
superior
he
is
apt
to
become
not
merely
unpoetical
and
irreverent
but
somewhat
of
a
sensualist
and
an
atheist
the
sense
of
the
beautiful
dies
out
in
him
more
and
more
he
has
little
or
nothing
around
him
to
refine
or
lift
up
his
soul
and
unless
he
meet
with
a
religion
and
with
a
civilization
which
can
deliver
him
he
may
sink
into
that
dull
brutality
which
is
too
common
among
the
lowest
classes
of
the
english
lowlands
and
remain
for
generations
gifted
with
the
strength
and
industry
of
the
ox
and
with
the
courage
of
the
lion
and
alas
with
the
intellect
of
the
former
and
the
of
the
latter
but
there
may
be
a
period
in
the
history
of
a
lowland
race
when
they
too
become
historic
for
a
while
there
was
such
a
period
for
the
men
of
the
eastern
counties
for
they
proved
it
by
their
deeds
when
the
men
of
wessex
the
once
conquering
race
of
britain
fell
at
hastings
once
and
for
all
and
struck
no
second
blow
then
the
men
of
the
danelagh
disdained
to
yield
to
the
norman
invader
for
seven
long
years
they
held
their
own
not
knowing
like
true
englishmen
when
they
were
beaten
and
fought
on
desperate
till
there
were
none
left
to
fight
their
bones
lay
white
on
every
island
in
the
fens
their
corpses
rotted
on
gallows
beneath
every
norman
keep
their
few
survivors
crawled
into
monasteries
with
eyes
picked
out
or
hands
and
feet
cut
off
or
took
to
the
wild
wood
as
strong
outlaws
like
their
successors
and
representatives
robin
hood
scarlet
and
john
adam
bell
and
clym
of
the
cleugh
and
william
of
cloudeslee
but
they
never
really
bent
their
necks
to
the
norman
yoke
they
kept
alive
in
their
hearts
that
proud
spirit
of
personal
independence
which
they
brought
with
them
from
the
moors
of
denmark
and
the
dales
of
norway
and
they
kept
alive
too
though
in
abeyance
for
a
while
those
free
institutions
which
were
without
a
doubt
the
germs
of
our
british
liberty
they
were
a
changed
folk
since
first
they
settled
in
that
danelagh
since
first
in
the
days
of
king
beorhtric
in
the
year
three
ships
of
northmen
came
from
haeretha
land
and
the
king
s
reeve
rode
to
the
place
and
would
have
driven
them
up
to
the
king
s
town
for
he
knew
not
what
men
they
were
but
they
slew
him
there
and
then
and
after
the
saxons
and
angles
began
to
find
out
to
their
bitter
bale
what
men
they
were
those
fierce
vikings
out
of
the
dark
northeast
but
they
had
long
ceased
to
burn
farms
sack
convents
torture
monks
for
gold
and
slay
every
human
being
they
met
in
mere
berserker
lust
of
blood
no
barnakill
could
now
earn
his
nickname
by
entreating
his
comrades
as
they
tossed
the
children
on
their
to
na
kill
the
gradually
they
had
settled
down
on
the
land
intermarried
with
the
angles
and
saxons
and
colonized
all
england
north
and
east
of
watling
street
a
rough
line
from
london
to
chester
and
the
eastern
lowlands
of
scotland
likewise
gradually
they
had
deserted
thor
and
odin
for
the
white
christ
had
their
own
priests
and
bishops
and
built
their
own
minsters
the
convents
which
the
fathers
had
destroyed
the
sons
or
at
least
the
grandsons
rebuilt
and
often
casting
away
sword
and
axe
they
entered
them
as
monks
themselves
and
peterborough
ely
and
above
all
crowland
destroyed
by
them
in
alfred
s
time
with
a
horrible
destruction
had
become
their
holy
places
where
they
decked
the
altars
with
gold
and
jewels
with
silks
from
the
far
east
and
furs
from
the
far
north
and
where
as
in
sacred
fortresses
they
and
the
liberty
of
england
with
them
made
their
last
unavailing
stand
for
a
while
they
had
been
lords
of
all
england
the
race
was
wearing
out
the
men
of
wessex
and
enslaved
by
their
own
aristocracy
quailed
before
the
free
norsemen
among
whom
was
not
a
single
serf
the
line
of
cerdic
and
alfred
was
worn
out
vain
incapable
profligate
kings
the
tools
of
such
prelates
as
odo
and
dunstan
were
no
match
for
such
wild
heroes
as
thorkill
the
tall
or
olaf
trygvasson
or
swend
forkbeard
the
danes
had
gradually
colonized
not
only
their
own
danelagh
and
northumbria
but
great
part
of
wessex
vast
sums
of
danegelt
were
yearly
sent
out
of
the
country
to
buy
off
the
fresh
invasions
which
were
perpetually
threatened
then
ethelred
the
unready
ethelred
advised
himself
to
fulfil
his
name
and
the
curse
which
dunstan
had
pronounced
against
him
at
the
baptismal
font
by
his
counsel
the
men
of
wessex
rose
against
the
unsuspecting
danes
and
on
brice
s
eve
murdered
them
all
with
tortures
man
woman
and
child
it
may
be
that
they
only
did
to
the
children
as
the
fathers
had
done
to
them
but
the
deed
was
worse
than
a
crime
it
was
a
the
danes
of
the
danelagh
and
of
northumbria
their
brothers
of
denmark
and
norway
the
orkneys
and
the
east
coast
of
ireland
remained
unharmed
a
mighty
host
of
vikings
poured
from
thence
into
england
the
very
next
year
under
swend
forkbeard
and
the
great
canute
and
after
thirteen
fearful
campaigns
came
the
great
battle
of
assingdown
in
essex
where
canute
had
the
victory
and
all
the
english
nation
fought
against
him
and
all
the
nobility
of
the
english
race
was
there
that
same
year
saw
the
mysterious
death
of
edmund
ironside
the
last
man
of
cerdic
s
race
worthy
of
the
name
for
the
next
years
danish
kings
ruled
from
the
forth
to
the
land
s
end
a
noble
figure
he
was
that
great
and
wise
canute
the
friend
of
the
famous
godiva
and
leofric
godiva
s
husband
and
siward
biorn
the
conqueror
of
macbeth
trying
to
expiate
by
justice
and
mercy
the
dark
deeds
of
his
bloodstained
youth
trying
and
not
in
vain
to
blend
the
two
races
over
which
he
ruled
rebuilding
the
churches
and
monasteries
which
his
father
had
destroyed
bringing
back
in
state
to
canterbury
the
body
of
archbishop
elphege
not
unjustly
called
by
the
saxons
martyr
and
saint
whom
tall
thorkill
s
men
had
murdered
with
beef
bones
and
because
he
would
not
give
up
to
them
the
money
destined
for
god
s
poor
rebuking
as
every
child
has
heard
his
housecarles
flattery
by
setting
his
chair
on
the
brink
of
the
rising
tide
and
then
laying
his
golden
crown
in
token
of
humility
on
the
high
altar
of
winchester
never
to
wear
it
more
in
winchester
lie
his
bones
unto
this
day
or
what
of
them
the
civil
wars
have
left
and
by
him
lie
the
bones
of
his
son
hardicanute
in
whom
as
in
his
harold
harefoot
before
him
the
danish
power
fell
to
swift
decay
by
insolence
and
drink
and
civil
war
and
with
the
danish
power
england
fell
to
pieces
likewise
canute
had
divided
england
into
four
great
earldoms
each
ruled
under
him
by
a
jarl
or
earl
a
danish
not
a
saxon
title
at
his
death
in
the
earldoms
of
northumbria
and
east
anglia
the
more
strictly
danish
parts
were
held
by
a
true
danish
hero
siward
biorn

the
stout
conqueror
of
macbeth

of

fairy

his
descent
men
said
by
his
pointed
and
hairy
ears
mercia
the
great
central
plateau
of
england
was
held
by
earl
leofric
husband
of
the
famous
lady
godiva
wessex
which
canute
had
at
first
kept
in
his
own
hands
had
passed
into
those
of
the
famous
earl
godwin
the
then
ablest
man
in
england
possessed
of
boundless
tact
and
cunning
gifted
with
an
eloquence
which
seems
from
the
accounts
remaining
of
it
to
have
been
rather
that
of
a
greek
than
an
englishman
himself
of
high
perhaps
of
royal
sussex
blood
for
the
story
of
his
low
birth
seems
a
mere
fable
of
his
french
enemies
and
married
first
to
canute
s
sister
and
then
to
his
niece
he
was
fitted
alike
by
fortunes
and
by
talents
to
be
the
which
he
became
such
a
system
may
have
worked
well
as
long
as
the
brain
of
a
hero
was
there
to
overlook
it
all
but
when
that
brain
was
turned
to
dust
the
history
of
england
became
till
the
norman
conquest
little
more
than
the
history
of
the
rivalries
of
the
two
great
houses
of
godwin
and
leofric
leofric
had
the
first
success
in
he
though
bearing
a
saxon
name
was
the
champion
of
the
danish
party
and
of
canute
s
son
or
reputed
son
harold
harefoot
and
he
succeeded
by
the
help
of
the
thanes
north
of
thames
and
the
lithsmen
of
london
which
city
was
more
than
half
danish
in
those
days
in
setting
his
puppet
on
the
throne
but
the
blood
of
canute
had
exhausted
itself
within
seven
years
harold
harefoot
and
hardicanute
who
succeeded
him
had
died
as
foully
as
they
lived
and
godwin
s
turn
had
come
he
though
married
to
a
danish
princess
and
acknowledging
his
danish
connection
by
the
norse
names
which
were
borne
by
his
three
most
famous
sons
harold
sweyn
and
tostig
constituted
himself
the
champion
of
the
men
of
wessex
and
the
house
of
cerdic
he
had
murdered
or
at
least
caused
to
be
murdered
horribly
alfred
the
etheling
king
ethelred
s
son
and
when
it
seemed
his
interest
to
support
the
claims
of
hardicanute
against
harefoot
he
now
found
little
difficulty
in
persuading
his
victim
s
younger
brother
to
come
to
england
and
become
at
once
his
king
his
and
his
puppet
edward
the
confessor
if
we
are
to
believe
the
monks
whom
he
pampered
was
naught
but
virtue
and
piety
meekness
and
magnanimity
a
model
ruler
of
men
such
a
model
ruler
he
was
doubtless
as
monks
would
be
glad
to
see
on
every
throne
because
while
he
rules
his
subjects
they
rule
him
no
wonder
therefore
that
according
to
william
of
malmesbury
the
happiness
of
his
times
famed
as
he
was
both
for
miracles
and
the
spirit
of
prophecy
was
revealed
in
a
dream
to
brithwin
bishop
of
wilton
who
made
it
public
who
meditating
in
king
canute
s
time
on
the
near
extinction
of
the
royal
race
of
the
english
was
rapt
up
on
high
and
saw
peter
consecrating
edward
king
his
chaste
life
also
was
pointed
out
and
the
exact
period
of
his
reign
years
determined
and
when
inquiring
about
his
posterity
it
was
answered
the
kingdom
of
the
english
belongs
to
god
after
you
he
will
provide
a
king
according
to
his
but
those
who
will
look
at
the
facts
will
see
in
the
holy
confessor
s
character
little
but
what
is
pitiable
and
in
his
reign
little
but
what
is
tragical
civil
wars
invasions
outlawry
of
godwin
and
his
sons
by
the
danish
party
then
of
alfgar
leofric
s
son
by
the
saxon
party
the
outlaws
on
either
side
attacking
and
plundering
the
english
shores
by
the
help
of
norsemen
welshmen
irish
and
danes
any
mercenaries
who
could
be
got
together
and
then
in
the
same
year
bishop
aldred
consecrated
the
minster
at
gloucester
to
the
glory
of
god
and
of
peter
and
then
went
to
jerusalem
with
such
splendor
as
no
man
had
displayed
before
him
and
so
forth
the
sum
and
substance
of
what
was
done
in
those
happy
times
may
be
well
described
in
the
words
of
the
chronicler
for
the
year
this
year
alfgar
the
earl
was
banished
but
he
came
in
again
with
violence
through
aid
of
griffin
the
king
of
north
wales
his
and
this
year
came
a
fleet
from
norway
it
is
tedious
to
tell
how
these
matters
these
were
the
normal
phenomena
of
a
reign
which
seemed
to
the
eyes
of
monks
a
holy
and
a
happy
one
because
the
king
refused
whether
from
spite
or
superstition
to
have
an
heir
to
the
house
of
cerdic
and
spent
his
time
between
prayer
hunting
the
seeing
of
fancied
visions
the
uttering
of
fancied
prophecies
and
the
performance
of
fancied
miracles
but
there
were
excuses
for
him
an
englishman
only
in
name
a
norman
not
only
of
his
mother
s
descent
she
was
aunt
of
william
the
conqueror
but
by
his
early
education
on
the
continent
he
loved
the
norman
better
than
the
englishman
norman
knights
and
clerks
filled
his
court
and
often
the
high
dignities
of
his
provinces
and
returned
as
often
as
expelled
the
language
became
fashionable
norman
customs
and
manners
the
signs
of
civilization
and
thus
all
was
preparing
steadily
for
the
great
catastrophe
by
which
within
a
year
of
edward
s
death
the
norman
became
master
of
the
land
perhaps
it
ought
to
have
been
so
perhaps
by
no
other
method
could
england
and
with
england
scotland
and
in
due
time
ireland
have
become
partakers
of
that
classic
civilization
and
learning
the
fount
whereof
for
good
and
for
evil
was
rome
and
the
pope
of
rome
but
the
method
was
at
least
wicked
the
actors
in
it
tyrannous
brutal
treacherous
hypocritical
and
the
conquest
of
england
by
william
will
remain
to
the
end
of
time
a
mighty
crime
abetted
one
may
almost
say
made
possible
as
too
many
such
crimes
have
been
before
and
since
by
the
intriguing
ambition
of
the
pope
of
rome
against
that
tyranny
the
free
men
of
the
danelagh
and
of
northumbria
rose
if
edward
the
descendant
of
cerdic
had
been
little
to
them
william
the
descendant
of
rollo
was
still
less
that
knights
should
expel
them
from
their
homes
monks
from
their
convents
because
edward
had
promised
the
crown
of
england
to
william
his
foreign
cousin
or
because
harold
godwinsson
of
wessex
had
sworn
on
the
relics
of
all
the
saints
to
be
william
s
man
was
contrary
to
their
of
right
and
reason
so
they
rose
and
fought
too
late
it
may
be
and
without
unity
or
purpose
and
they
were
worsted
by
an
enemy
who
had
both
unity
and
purpose
whom
superstition
greed
and
feudal
discipline
kept
together
at
least
in
england
in
one
compact
body
of
unscrupulous
and
terrible
confederates
but
theirs
was
a
land
worth
fighting
for
a
good
land
and
large
from
humber
mouth
inland
to
the
trent
and
merry
sherwood
across
to
chester
and
the
dee
round
by
leicester
and
the
five
burghs
of
the
danes
eastward
again
to
huntingdon
and
cambridge
then
a
poor
village
on
the
site
of
an
old
roman
town
and
then
northward
again
into
the
wide
fens
the
land
of
the
girvii
and
the
eormingas
the
children
of
the
where
the
great
central
plateau
of
england
slides
into
the
sea
to
form
from
the
rain
and
river
washings
of
eight
shires
lowlands
of
a
fertility
inexhaustible
because
to
this
day
they
have
a
beauty
of
their
own
these
great
fens
even
now
when
they
are
diked
and
drained
tilled
and
fenced
a
beauty
as
of
the
sea
of
boundless
expanse
and
freedom
much
more
had
they
that
beauty
eight
hundred
years
ago
when
they
were
still
for
the
most
part
as
god
had
made
them
or
rather
was
making
them
even
then
the
low
rolling
uplands
were
clothed
in
primeval
forest
oak
and
ash
beech
and
elm
with
here
and
there
perhaps
a
group
of
ancient
pines
ragged
and
decayed
and
fast
dying
out
in
england
even
then
though
lingering
still
in
the
forests
of
the
scotch
highlands
between
the
forests
were
open
wolds
dotted
with
white
sheep
and
golden
gorse
rolling
plains
of
rich
though
ragged
turf
whether
cleared
by
the
hand
of
man
or
by
the
wild
fires
which
often
swept
over
the
hills
and
between
the
wood
and
the
wold
stood
many
a
danish
town
with
its
clusters
of
low
straggling
buildings
round
the
holder
s
house
stone
or
mud
below
and
wood
above
its
high
dikes
round
tiny
fields
its
flocks
of
sheep
ranging
on
the
wold
its
herds
of
swine
in
the
forest
and
below
a
more
precious
possession
still
its
herds
of
mares
and
colts
which
fed
with
the
cattle
in
the
rich
for
always
from
the
foot
of
the
wolds
the
green
flat
stretched
away
illimitable
to
an
horizon
where
from
the
roundness
of
the
earth
the
distant
trees
and
islands
were
hulled
down
like
ships
at
sea
the
firm
lay
bright
green
along
the
foot
of
the
wold
beyond
it
the
browner
peat
or
deep
fen
and
among
it
dark
velvet
alder
beds
long
lines
of
emerald
in
spring
and
golden
under
the
autumn
sun
shining
broad
meres
dotted
with
a
million
fowl
while
the
cattle
waded
along
their
edges
after
the
rich
or
wallowed
in
the
mire
through
the
hot
summer
s
day
here
and
there
too
upon
the
far
horizon
rose
a
tall
line
of
ashen
trees
marking
some
island
of
firm
rich
soil
here
and
there
too
as
at
ramsey
and
crowland
the
huge
ashes
had
disappeared
before
the
axes
of
the
monks
and
a
minster
tower
rose
over
the
fen
amid
orchards
gardens
cornfields
pastures
with
here
and
there
a
tree
left
standing
for
shade
painted
with
flowers
in
the
spring
with
pleasant
shores
embosomed
in
still
lakes
as
the
of
ramsey
has
it
those
islands
seemed
to
such
as
the
monk
terrestrial
paradises
overhead
the
arch
of
heaven
spread
more
ample
than
elsewhere
as
over
the
open
sea
and
that
vastness
gave
and
still
gives
such
effects
of
cloudland
of
sunrise
and
sunset
as
can
be
seen
nowhere
else
within
these
isles
they
might
well
have
been
star
worshippers
those
girvii
had
their
sky
been
as
clear
as
that
of
the
east
but
they
were
like
to
have
worshipped
the
clouds
rather
than
the
stars
according
to
the
too
universal
law
that
mankind
worship
the
powers
which
do
them
harm
rather
than
the
powers
which
do
them
good
and
therefore
the
danelagh
men
who
feared
not
mortal
sword
or
axe
feared
witches
ghosts
pucks
werewolves
spirits
of
the
wells
and
of
the
trees
and
all
dark
capricious
and
harmful
beings
whom
their
fancy
conjured
up
out
of
the
wild
wet
and
unwholesome
marshes
or
the
dark
woods
for
that
fair
land
like
all
things
on
earth
had
its
darker
aspect
the
foul
exhalations
of
autumn
called
up
fever
and
ague
crippling
and
enervating
and
tempting
almost
compelling
to
that
wild
and
desperate
drinking
which
was
the
scandinavian
s
special
sin
dark
and
sad
were
those
short
autumn
days
when
all
the
distances
were
shut
off
and
the
air
choked
with
foul
brown
fog
and
drenching
rains
from
off
the
eastern
sea
and
pleasant
the
bursting
forth
of
the
keen
wind
with
all
its
whirling
snowstorms
for
though
it
sent
men
hurrying
out
into
the
storm
to
drive
the
cattle
in
from
the
fen
and
lift
the
sheep
out
of
the
and
now
and
then
never
to
return
lost
in
mist
and
mire
in
ice
and
snow
yet
all
knew
that
after
the
snow
would
come
the
keen
frost
and
the
bright
sun
and
cloudless
blue
sky
and
the
fenman
s
yearly
holiday
when
work
being
impossible
all
gave
themselves
up
to
play
and
swarmed
upon
the
ice
on
skates
and
sledges
and
ran
races
township
against
township
or
visited
old
friends
full
forty
miles
away
and
met
everywhere
faces
as
bright
and
ruddy
as
their
own
cheered
by
the
keen
wine
of
that
dry
and
bracing
frost
such
was
the
fenland
hard
yet
cheerful
rearing
a
race
of
hard
and
cheerful
men
showing
their
power
in
old
times
in
valiant
fighting
and
for
many
a
century
since
in
that
valiant
industry
which
has
drained
and
embanked
the
land
of
the
girvii
till
it
has
become
a
very
garden
of
the
and
the
scotsman
who
may
look
from
the
promontory
of
peterborough
the
golden
borough
of
old
time

from
the

of
crowland
while
hereward

torfrida
sleep
in
the

nave
beneath

the
heights

was
so
long

camp
of
refuge
for
english
freedom
over
the
labyrinth
of
dikes

lodes

confess
that

farms
which
leofric
possessed
was
neither
the
stately
hall
at
loughton
by
bridgenorth
nor
the
statelier
castle
of
warwick
but
the
house
of
bourne
in
south
lincolnshire
between
the
great
woods
of
the
bruneswald
and
the
great
level
of
the
fens
it
may
have
been
her
own
paternal
dowry
and
have
come
down
to
her
in
right
of
her
danish
ancestors
and
that
great
and
magnificent
jarl
oslac
from
whom
she
derived
her
blood
this
is
certain
that
leofric
her
husband
went
in
east
anglia
by
the
name
of
leofric
lord
of
bourne
that
as
domesday
book
testifies
his
son
alfgar
and
his
grandson
morcar
held
large
lands
there
and
thereabout
alfgar
s
name
indeed
still
lives
in
the
village
of
and
lady
godiva
and
algar
after
her
enriched
with
great
gifts
crowland
the
island
sanctuary
and
peterborough
where
brand
either
her
brother
or
leofric
s
was
a
monk
and
in
due
time
an
abbot
the
house
of
bourne
as
far
as
it
can
be
reconstructed
by
imagination
was
altogether
unlike
one
of
the
tall
and
gloomy
norman
castles
which
twenty
years
later
reared
their
evil
donjons
over
england
it
was
much
more
like
a
house
in
a
chinese
painting
an
irregular
group
of
low
buildings
almost
all
of
one
story
stone
below
and
timber
above
with
roofs
at
least
in
the
more
danish
country
affording
a
separate
room
or
rather
house
for
each
different
need
of
the
family
such
a
one
may
be
seen
in
the
illuminations
of
the
century
in
the
centre
of
the
building
is
the
hall
with
door
or
doors
opening
out
into
the
court
and
sitting
thereat
at
the
top
of
a
flight
of
steps
the
lord
and
lady
dealing
clothes
to
the
naked
and
bread
to
the
hungry
on
one
side
of
the
hall
is
a
chapel
by
it
a
large
room
or
bower
for
the
ladies
behind
the
hall
a
round
tower
seemingly
the
strong
place
of
the
whole
house
on
the
other
side
a
kitchen
and
stuck
on
to
bower
kitchen
and
every
other
principal
building
after
the
uses
of
which
it
is
impossible
now
to
discover
the
house
had
grown
with
the
wants
of
the
family
as
many
good
old
english
houses
have
done
to
this
day
round
it
would
be
scattered
barns
and
stables
in
which
grooms
and
herdsmen
slept
side
by
side
with
their
own
horses
and
cattle
and
outside
all
the
yard
garth
or
high
with
palisades
on
top
which
formed
a
strong
defence
in
time
of
war
such
was
most
probably
the
villa
ton
or
town
of
earl
leofric
the
lord
of
bourne
the
favorite
residence
of
godiva
once
most
beautiful
and
still
most
holy
according
to
the
holiness
of
those
old
times
now
on
a
day
about
the
year
while
earl
siward
was
helping
to
bring
birnam
wood
to
dunsinane
to
avenge
his
murdered
lady
godiva
sat
not
at
her
hall
door
dealing
food
and
clothing
to
her
thirteen
poor
folk
but
in
her
bower
with
her
youngest
son
a
boy
at
her
knee
she
was
listening
with
a
face
of
shame
and
horror
to
the
complaint
of
herluin
steward
of
peterborough
who
had
fallen
in
that
afternoon
with
hereward
and
his
crew
of
to
keep
a
following
of
stout
housecarles
or
was
the
pride
as
well
as
the
duty
of
an
lord
as
it
was
till
lately
of
a
highland
laird
and
hereward
in
imitation
of
his
father
and
his
elder
brother
must
needs
have
his
following
from
the
time
he
was
but
fifteen
years
old
all
the
unruly
youths
of
the
neighborhood
sons
of
free
holders
who
owed
some
sort
of
military
service
to
earl
leofric
geri
his
cousin
winter
whom
he
called
his
the
wulfrics
the
wulfards
the
azers
and
many
another
wild
blade
had
banded
themselves
round
a
young
nobleman
more
unruly
than
themselves
their
names
were
already
a
terror
to
all
decent
folk
at
wakes
and
fairs
alehouses
and
village
sports
they
atoned
be
it
remembered
for
their
early
sins
by
making
those
names
in
after
years
a
terror
to
the
invaders
of
their
native
land
but
as
yet
their
prowess
was
limited
to
drunken
brawls
and
to
upsetting
old
women
at
their
work
levying
blackmail
from
quiet
chapmen
on
the
high
road
or
bringing
back
in
triumph
sword
in
hand
and
club
on
shoulder
their
leader
hereward
from
some
duel
which
his
insolence
had
provoked
but
this
time
if
the
story
of
the
was
to
be
believed
hereward
and
his
housecarles
had
taken
an
ugly
stride
forward
toward
the
pit
they
had
met
him
riding
along
intent
upon
his
psalter
in
a
lonely
path
of
the
bruneswald
whereon
your
son
most
gracious
lady
bade
me
stand
saying
that
his
men
were
thirsty
and
he
had
no
money
to
buy
ale
withal
and
none
so
likely
to
help
him
thereto
as
a
fat
priest
for
so
he
scandalously
termed
me
who
as
your
ladyship
knows
am
leaner
than
the
minster
with
fasting
wednesdays
and
fridays
throughout
the
year
beside
the
vigils
of
the
saints
and
the
former
and
latter
lents
but
when
he
saw
who
i
was
as
if
inspired
by
a
malignant
spirit
he
shouted
out
my
name
and
bade
his
companions
throw
me
to
the
throw
you
to
the
ground
shuddered
the
lady
godiva
in
much
mire
madam
after
which
he
took
my
palfrey
saying
that
heaven
s
gate
was
too
lowly
for
men
on
horseback
to
get
in
thereat
and
then
my
marten
s
fur
gloves
and
cape
which
your
gracious
self
bestowed
on
me
alleging
that
the
rules
of
my
order
allowed
only
one
garment
and
no
furs
save
catskins
and
such
like
and
lastly
i
tremble
while
i
relate
thinking
not
of
the
loss
of
my
poor
money
but
the
loss
of
an
immortal
soul
took
from
me
a
purse
with
sixteen
silver
pennies
which
i
had
collected
from
our
tenants
for
the
use
of
the
monastery
and
said
blasphemously
that
i
and
mine
had
swindled
your
ladyship
and
therefore
him
your
son
out
of
many
a
fair
manor
ere
now
and
it
was
but
fair
that
he
should
tithe
the
rents
thereof
as
he
should
never
get
the
lands
out
of
our
claws
again
with
more
of
the
like
which
i
blush
to
repeat
and
so
left
me
to
trudge
hither
in
the
wretched
boy
said
the
lady
godiva
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
more
wretched
i
to
have
brought
such
a
son
into
the
world
the
monk
had
hardly
finished
his
doleful
story
when
there
was
a
pattering
of
heavy
feet
a
noise
of
men
shouting
and
laughing
outside
and
a
voice
above
all
calling
for
the
monk
by
name
which
made
that
good
man
crouch
behind
the
curtain
of
lady
godiva
s
bed
the
next
moment
the
door
of
the
bower
was
thrown
violently
open
and
in
walked
or
rather
reeled
a
noble
lad
eighteen
years
old
his
face
was
of
extraordinary
beauty
save
that
the
lower
jaw
was
too
long
and
heavy
and
that
his
eyes
wore
a
strange
and
almost
sinister
expression
from
the
fact
that
the
one
of
them
was
gray
and
the
other
blue
he
was
short
but
of
immense
breadth
of
chest
and
strength
of
limb
while
his
delicate
hands
and
feet
and
long
locks
of
golden
hair
marked
him
of
most
noble
and
even
as
he
really
was
of
ancient
royal
race
he
was
dressed
in
a
gaudy
costume
resembling
on
the
whole
that
of
a
highland
chieftain
his
knees
wrists
and
throat
were
tattoed
in
bright
blue
patterns
and
he
carried
sword
and
dagger
a
gold
ring
round
his
neck
and
gold
rings
on
his
wrists
he
was
a
lad
to
have
gladdened
the
eyes
of
any
mother
but
there
was
no
gladness
in
the
lady
godiva
s
eyes
as
she
received
him
nor
had
there
been
for
many
a
year
she
looked
on
him
with
sternness
with
all
but
horror
and
he
his
face
flushed
with
wine
which
he
had
tossed
off
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
to
steady
his
nerves
for
the
coming
storm
looked
at
her
with
smiling
defiance
the
result
of
long
estrangement
between
mother
and
son
well
my
lady
said
he
ere
she
could
speak
i
heard
that
this
good
fellow
was
here
and
came
home
as
fast
as
i
could
to
see
that
he
told
you
as
few
lies
as
he
has
told
me
said
she
that
you
have
robbed
the
church
of
robbed
him
it
may
be
an
old
hoody
crow
against
whom
i
have
a
grudge
of
ten
years
wretched
wretched
boy
what
wickedness
next
know
you
not
that
he
who
robs
the
church
robs
god
himself
and
he
who
harms
god
s
people
put
in
the
monk
from
behind
the
chair
harms
his
his
maker
said
the
lad
with
concentrated
bitterness
it
would
be
a
gay
world
if
the
maker
thereof
were
in
any
way
like
unto
you
who
call
yourselves
his
people
do
you
remember
who
told
them
to
set
the
on
fire
under
me
ten
years
ago
ah
ha
sir
monk
you
forget
that
i
have
been
behind
the
screen
that
i
have
been
a
monk
myself
or
should
have
been
one
if
my
pious
lady
mother
here
had
had
her
will
of
me
as
she
may
if
she
likes
of
that
doll
there
at
her
knee
do
you
forget
why
i
left
peterborough
abbey
when
winter
and
i
turned
all
your
priest
s
books
upside
down
in
the
choir
and
they
would
have
flogged
us
me
the
earl
s
son
me
the
viking
s
son
me
the
champion
as
i
will
be
yet
and
make
all
lands
ring
with
the
fame
of
my
deeds
as
they
rung
with
the
fame
of
my
forefathers
before
they
became
the
slaves
of
monks
and
how
when
winter
and
i
got
hold
of
the
kitchen
spits
and
up
to
the
top
of
the
and
held
you
all
at
bay
there
a
whole
abbeyful
of
cowards
there
against
two
seven
years
children
it
was
you
bade
set
the
alight
under
us
and
so
bring
us
down
and
would
have
done
it
too
had
it
not
been
for
my
uncle
brand
the
only
man
that
i
care
for
in
this
wide
world
do
you
think
i
have
not
owed
you
a
grudge
ever
since
that
day
monk
and
do
you
think
i
will
not
pay
it
do
you
think
i
would
not
have
burned
peterborough
minster
over
your
head
before
now
had
it
not
been
for
uncle
brand
s
sake
see
that
i
do
not
do
it
yet
see
that
when
there
is
another
prior
in
borough
you
do
not
find
hereward
the
berserker
smoking
you
out
some
dark
night
as
he
would
smoke
a
wasps
nest
and
i
will
by
hereward
hereward
cried
his
mother
godless
boy
what
words
are
these
silence
before
you
burden
your
soul
with
an
oath
which
the
devils
in
hell
will
accept
and
force
you
to
keep
and
she
sprung
up
and
seizing
his
arm
laid
her
hand
upon
his
mouth
hereward
looked
at
her
majestic
face
once
lovely
now
careworn
and
trembled
for
a
moment
had
there
been
any
tenderness
in
it
his
history
might
have
been
a
very
different
one
but
alas
there
was
none
not
that
she
was
in
herself
untender
but
that
her
great
piety
call
it
not
superstition
for
it
was
then
the
only
form
known
or
possible
to
pure
and
devout
souls
was
so
outraged
by
this
or
even
by
the
slightest
insult
to
that
clergy
whose
willing
slave
she
had
become
that
the
only
method
of
reclaiming
the
sinner
had
been
long
forgotten
in
genuine
horror
at
his
sin
is
it
not
enough
she
went
on
sternly
that
you
should
have
become
the
bully
and
the
ruffian
of
all
the
fens
that
hereward
the
leaper
hereward
the
wrestler
hereward
the
thrower
of
the
hammer
sports
after
all
only
fit
for
the
sons
of
slaves
should
be
also
hereward
the
drunkard
hereward
the
common
fighter
hereward
the
breaker
of
houses
hereward
the
leader
of
mobs
of
boon
companions
which
bring
back
to
us
in
shame
and
sorrow
the
days
when
our
heathen
forefathers
ravaged
this
land
with
fire
and
sword
is
it
not
enough
for
me
that
my
son
should
be
a
common
stabber
whoever
called
me
stabber
to
you
lies
if
i
have
killed
men
or
had
them
killed
i
have
done
it
in
fair
but
she
went
on
unheeding
is
it
not
enough
that
after
having
squandered
on
your
fellows
all
the
money
that
you
could
wring
from
my
bounty
or
win
at
your
brutal
sports
you
should
have
robbed
your
own
father
collected
his
rents
behind
his
back
taken
money
and
goods
from
his
tenants
by
threats
and
blows
but
that
after
outraging
them
you
must
add
to
all
this
a
worse
sin
likewise
outraging
god
and
driving
me
me
who
have
borne
with
you
me
who
have
concealed
all
for
your
sake
to
tell
your
father
that
of
which
the
very
telling
will
turn
my
hair
to
gray
so
you
will
tell
my
father
said
hereward
coolly
and
if
i
should
not
this
monk
himself
is
bound
to
do
so
or
his
superior
your
uncle
my
uncle
brand
will
not
and
your
monk
dare
then
i
must
i
have
loved
you
long
and
well
but
there
is
one
thing
which
i
must
love
better
than
you
and
that
is
my
conscience
and
my
those
are
two
things
my
lady
mother
and
not
one
so
you
had
better
not
confound
them
as
for
the
latter
do
you
not
think
that
he
who
made
the
world
is
well
able
to
defend
his
own
property
if
the
lands
and
houses
and
cattle
and
money
which
these
men
wheedle
and
threaten
and
forge
out
of
you
and
my
father
are
really
his
property
and
not
merely
their
plunder
as
for
your
conscience
my
lady
mother
really
you
have
done
so
many
good
deeds
in
your
life
that
it
might
be
beneficial
to
you
to
do
a
bad
one
once
in
a
way
so
as
to
keep
your
soul
in
a
wholesome
state
of
the
monk
groaned
aloud
lady
godiva
groaned
but
it
was
inwardly
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
both
were
abashed
by
the
lad
s
utter
shamelessness
and
you
will
tell
my
father
said
he
again
he
is
at
the
old
s
court
at
westminster
he
will
tell
the
and
i
shall
be
and
if
you
be
wretched
boy
whom
have
you
to
blame
but
yourself
can
you
expect
that
the
king
sainted
even
as
he
is
before
his
death
dare
pass
over
such
an
atrocity
towards
holy
church
blame
i
shall
blame
no
one
pass
over
i
hope
he
will
not
pass
over
it
i
only
want
an
excuse
like
that
for
turning
as
those
norman
puppies
call
it
like
regnar
lodbrog
or
frithiof
or
harold
hardraade
and
try
what
man
can
do
for
himself
in
the
world
with
nothing
to
help
him
in
heaven
and
earth
with
neither
saint
nor
angel
friend
or
counsellor
to
see
to
him
save
his
wits
and
his
good
sword
so
send
off
the
messenger
good
mother
mine
and
i
will
promise
you
i
will
not
have
him
on
the
way
as
some
of
my
housecarles
would
do
for
me
if
i
but
held
up
my
hand
and
let
the
fill
up
the
measure
of
his
folly
by
making
an
enemy
of
one
more
bold
fellow
in
the
and
he
swaggered
out
of
the
room
and
when
he
was
gone
the
lady
godiva
bowed
her
head
into
her
lap
and
wept
long
and
bitterly
neither
her
maidens
nor
the
priest
dare
speak
to
her
for
nigh
an
hour
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
lifted
up
her
head
and
settled
her
face
again
till
it
was
like
that
of
a
marble
saint
over
a
minster
door
and
called
for
ink
and
paper
and
wrote
her
letter
and
then
asked
for
a
trusty
messenger
who
should
carry
it
up
to
westminster
none
so
swift
or
sure
said
the
house
steward
as
martin
lady
godiva
shook
her
head
i
mistrust
that
man
she
said
he
is
too
fond
of
my
poor
of
the
lord
he
is
a
strange
one
my
lady
and
no
one
knows
whence
he
came
and
i
sometimes
fancy
whither
he
may
go
either
but
ever
since
my
lord
threatened
to
hang
him
for
talking
with
my
young
master
he
has
never
spoken
to
him
nor
scarcely
indeed
to
living
soul
and
one
thing
there
is
makes
him
or
any
man
sure
as
long
as
he
is
well
paid
and
that
is
that
he
cares
for
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
save
himself
and
what
he
can
so
martin
lightfoot
was
sent
for
he
came
in
straight
into
the
lady
s
bedchamber
after
the
simple
fashion
of
those
days
he
was
a
tall
lean
bony
man
as
was
to
be
expected
from
his
nickname
with
a
long
hooked
nose
a
scanty
brown
beard
and
a
high
conical
head
his
only
garment
was
a
shabby
gray
woollen
tunic
which
served
him
both
as
coat
and
kilt
and
laced
brogues
of
untanned
hide
he
might
have
been
any
age
from
twenty
to
forty
but
his
face
was
disfigured
with
deep
scars
and
long
exposure
to
the
weather
he
dropped
on
one
knee
holding
his
greasy
cap
in
his
hand
and
looked
not
at
his
lady
s
face
but
at
her
feet
with
a
stupid
and
frightened
expression
she
knew
very
little
of
him
save
that
her
husband
had
picked
him
up
upon
the
road
as
a
wanderer
some
five
years
since
and
that
he
had
been
employed
as
a
doer
of
odd
jobs
and
runner
of
messages
and
that
he
was
supposed
from
his
taciturnity
and
strangeness
to
have
something
uncanny
about
him
martin
said
the
lady
they
tell
me
that
you
are
a
silent
and
a
prudent
that
am
i
tongue
speaketh
bane
though
she
herself
hath
i
shall
try
you
do
you
know
your
way
to
london
to
your
lord
s
lodgings
in
westminster
how
long
shall
you
be
going
there
with
this
letter
a
day
and
a
when
shall
you
be
back
hither
on
the
fourth
and
you
will
go
to
my
lord
and
deliver
this
letter
safely
yes
your
why
do
you
call
me
majesty
the
king
is
you
are
my
what
do
you
mean
man
you
can
hang
i
hang
thee
poor
soul
who
did
i
ever
hang
or
hurt
for
a
moment
if
i
could
help
it
but
the
earl
he
will
neither
hang
nor
hurt
thee
if
thou
wilt
take
this
letter
safely
and
bring
me
back
the
answer
they
will
kill
who
they
said
martin
pointing
to
the
bower
maidens
young
ladies
of
good
family
who
stood
round
chosen
for
their
good
looks
after
the
fashion
of
those
times
to
attend
on
great
ladies
there
was
a
cry
of
angry
and
contemptuous
denial
not
unmixed
with
something
like
laughter
which
showed
that
martin
had
but
spoken
the
truth
hereward
in
spite
of
all
his
sins
was
the
darling
of
his
mother
s
bower
and
there
was
not
one
of
the
damsels
but
would
have
done
anything
short
of
murder
to
have
prevented
martin
carrying
the
letter
silence
man
said
lady
godiva
so
sternly
that
martin
saw
that
he
had
gone
too
far
how
know
st
such
as
thou
what
is
in
this
letter
those
others
will
know
said
martin
sullenly
without
answering
the
last
question
who
his
housecarles
outside
he
has
promised
that
they
shall
not
touch
thee
but
how
knowest
thou
what
is
in
this
letter
i
will
take
it
said
martin
he
held
out
his
hand
took
it
and
looked
at
it
but
upside
down
and
without
any
attempt
to
read
it
his
own
mother
said
he
after
a
while
what
is
that
to
thee
said
lady
godiva
blushing
and
kindling
nothing
i
had
no
mother
but
god
has
one
what
meanest
thou
knave
wilt
thou
take
the
letter
or
no
i
will
take
and
he
again
looked
at
it
without
rising
off
his
knee
his
own
father
what
is
that
to
thee
i
say
again
nothing
i
have
no
father
but
god
s
son
has
one
what
wilt
thou
thou
strange
man
asked
she
puzzled
and
and
how
camest
thou
to
know
what
is
in
this
letter
who
does
not
know
a
city
that
is
set
on
a
hill
can
not
be
hid
on
the
fourth
day
from
this
i
will
be
and
martin
rose
and
putting
the
letter
solemnly
into
the
purse
at
his
girdle
shot
out
of
the
door
with
clenched
teeth
as
a
man
upon
a
fixed
purpose
which
it
would
lighten
his
heart
to
carry
out
he
ran
rapidly
through
the
large
outer
hall
past
the
long
oak
table
at
which
hereward
and
his
boon
companions
were
drinking
and
roistering
and
as
he
passed
the
young
lord
he
cast
on
him
a
look
so
full
of
meaning
that
though
hereward
knew
not
what
the
meaning
was
it
startled
him
and
for
a
moment
softened
him
did
this
man
who
had
sullenly
avoided
him
for
more
than
two
years
whom
he
had
looked
on
as
a
clod
or
a
post
in
the
field
beneath
his
notice
since
he
could
be
of
no
use
to
him
did
this
man
still
care
for
him
hereward
had
reason
to
know
better
than
most
that
there
was
something
strange
and
uncanny
about
the
man
did
he
mean
him
well
or
had
he
some
grudge
against
him
which
made
him
undertake
this
journey
willingly
and
out
of
spite
possibly
with
the
will
to
make
bad
worse
for
an
instant
hereward
s
heart
misgave
him
he
would
stop
the
letter
at
all
risks
hold
him
he
cried
to
his
comrades
but
martin
turned
to
him
laid
his
finger
on
his
lips
smiled
kindly
and
saying
you
promised
caught
up
a
loaf
from
the
table
slipped
from
among
them
like
an
eel
and
darted
out
of
the
door
and
out
of
the
close
they
followed
him
to
the
great
gate
and
there
stopped
some
cursing
some
laughing
to
give
martin
lightfoot
a
yard
advantage
was
never
to
come
up
with
him
again
some
called
for
bows
to
bring
him
down
with
a
parting
shot
but
hereward
forbade
them
and
stood
leaning
against
the
watching
him
trot
on
like
a
lean
wolf
over
the
lawn
till
he
was
lost
in
the
great
which
fringed
the
southern
fen
now
lads
said
hereward
home
with
you
all
and
make
your
peace
with
your
fathers
in
this
house
you
never
drink
ale
they
looked
at
him
surprised
you
are
disbanded
my
gallant
army
as
long
as
i
could
cut
long
thongs
out
of
other
men
s
hides
i
could
feed
you
like
earl
s
sons
but
now
i
must
feed
myself
and
a
dog
over
his
bone
wants
no
company
outlawed
i
shall
be
before
the
week
is
out
and
unless
you
wish
to
be
outlawed
too
you
will
obey
orders
and
we
will
follow
you
to
the
world
s
end
cried
some
to
the
rope
s
end
lads
that
is
all
you
will
get
in
my
company
go
home
with
you
and
those
who
feel
a
calling
let
them
turn
monks
and
those
who
have
not
let
them
learn
for
to
plough
and
to
sow
and
to
reap
and
to
mow
and
to
be
a
farmer
s
good
and
he
went
in
and
shut
the
great
gates
after
him
leaving
them
astonished
to
take
his
advice
and
go
home
was
the
simplest
thing
to
be
done
a
few
of
them
on
their
return
were
soundly
thrashed
and
deserved
it
a
few
were
hidden
by
their
mothers
for
a
week
in
and
till
their
father
s
anger
had
passed
away
but
only
one
turned
monk
or
clerk
and
that
was
leofric
the
unlucky
godson
of
the
great
earl
and
to
the
band
the
next
morning
at
dawn
hereward
mounted
his
best
horse
armed
himself
from
head
to
foot
and
rode
over
to
peterborough
when
he
came
to
the
he
smote
thereon
with
his
till
the
porter
s
teeth
rattled
in
his
head
for
fear
let
me
in
he
shouted
i
am
hereward
leofricsson
i
must
see
my
uncle
o
my
most
gracious
lord
cried
the
porter
thrusting
his
head
out
of
the
wicket
what
is
this
that
you
have
been
doing
to
our
steward
the
tithe
of
what
i
will
do
unless
you
open
the
gate
o
my
lord
said
the
porter
as
he
opened
it
if
our
lady
and
peter
would
but
have
mercy
on
your
fair
face
and
convert
your
soul
to
the
fear
of
god
and
man
she
would
make
me
as
good
an
old
fool
as
you
fetch
my
uncle
the
the
porter
obeyed
the
son
of
earl
leofric
was
as
a
young
lion
among
the
sheep
in
those
parts
and
few
dare
say
him
nay
certainly
not
the
monks
of
peterborough
moreover
the
good
porter
could
not
help
being
strangely
fond
of
hereward
as
was
every
one
whom
he
did
not
insult
rob
or
kill
out
came
brand
a
noble
elder
more
fit
from
his
eye
and
gait
to
be
a
knight
than
a
monk
he
looked
sadly
at
hereward
dear
is
bought
the
honey
that
is
licked
off
the
thorn
quoth
hending
said
he
hending
bought
his
wisdom
by
experience
i
suppose
said
hereward
and
so
must
i
so
i
am
just
starting
out
to
see
the
world
naughty
naughty
boy
if
we
had
thee
safe
here
again
for
a
week
we
would
take
this
hot
blood
out
of
thee
and
send
thee
home
in
thy
right
bring
a
rod
and
whip
me
then
try
and
you
shall
have
your
chance
every
one
else
has
had
and
this
is
the
end
of
their
by
the
chains
of
peter
quoth
the
monk
that
is
just
what
thou
needest
hoist
thee
on
such
another
fool
s
back
truss
thee
up
and
lay
it
on
lustily
till
thou
art
ashamed
to
treat
thee
as
a
man
is
only
to
make
thee
a
more
heady
ass
than
thou
art
true
most
wise
uncle
and
therefore
my
still
wiser
parents
are
going
to
treat
me
like
a
man
indeed
and
send
me
out
into
the
world
to
seek
my
fortunes
eh
they
are
going
to
prove
how
thoroughly
they
trust
me
to
take
care
of
myself
by
outlawing
me
eh
say
i
in
return
is
not
that
an
honor
and
a
proof
that
i
have
not
shown
myself
a
fool
though
i
may
have
a
madman
outlaw
you
o
my
boy
my
darling
my
pride
get
off
your
horse
and
don
t
sit
there
hand
on
hip
like
a
turbaned
saracen
defying
god
and
man
but
come
down
and
talk
reason
to
me
for
the
sake
of
peter
and
all
hereward
threw
himself
off
his
horse
and
threw
his
arms
round
his
uncle
s
neck
pish
now
uncle
don
t
cry
do
what
you
will
lest
i
cry
too

me
to
be
a
man
while
i
live
even
if
i
go
to
the
black
place
when
i
it
shall
not
be

the
monk

all
the
relics

peterborough
minster

must
be

shall
be
i
like
to
be
outlawed

want

like

man

is
not
an
earl
in
england

my
father
who
has
not
been
outlawed
in
his
time
my
brother
alfgar

be
outlawed
before
he
dies
if
he

the
spirit
of
a
man
in
him

is
the
fashion

uncle
and
i
must
follow
it
so

the
rest

word
out
of
the
kaiser
s
treasure
and
pay
thee
back
five
to
what
does
this
son
of
belial
here
asked
an
austere
voice
ah
abbot
leofric
my
very
good
lord
i
have
come
to
ask
hospitality
of
you
for
some
three
days
by
that
time
i
shall
be
a
wolf
s
head
and
out
of
the
law
and
then
if
you
will
give
me
ten
minutes
start
you
may
put
your
bloodhounds
on
my
track
and
see
which
runs
fastest
they
or
i
you
are
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honor
so
i
trust
to
you
to
feed
my
horse
fairly
the
meanwhile
and
not
to
let
your
monks
poison
the
abbot
s
face
relaxed
he
tried
to
look
as
solemn
as
he
could
but
he
ended
in
bursting
into
a
very
great
laughter
and
swearing
likewise
the
insolence
of
this
lad
passes
the
miracles
of
all
saints
he
robs
peter
on
the
highway
breaks
into
his
abbey
insults
him
to
his
face
and
then
asks
him
for
hospitality
and
and
gets
it
quoth
hereward
what
is
to
be
done
with
him
brand
my
friend
if
we
turn
him
out
which
we
can
not
do
said
brand
looking
at
the
and
armed
lad
without
calling
in
half
a
dozen
of
our
in
which
case
there
would
be
blood
shed
and
scandal
made
in
the
holy
and
nothing
gained
for
yield
he
would
not
till
he
was
killed
outright
which
god
forbid
amen
and
if
he
stay
here
he
may
be
persuaded
to
and
as
for
that
quoth
hereward
who
had
remounted
his
horse
from
prudential
motives
and
set
him
athwart
the
gateway
so
that
there
was
no
chance
of
the
doors
being
slammed
behind
him
if
either
of
you
will
lend
me
sixteen
pence
i
will
pay
it
back
to
you
and
peter
before
i
die
with
interest
enough
to
satisfy
any
jew
on
the
word
of
a
gentleman
and
an
earl
s
the
abbot
burst
again
into
a
great
laughter
come
in
thou
graceless
renegade
and
we
will
see
to
thee
and
thy
horse
and
i
will
pray
to
peter
and
i
doubt
not
he
will
have
patience
with
thee
for
he
is
very
merciful
and
after
all
thy
parents
have
been
exceeding
good
to
us
and
the
righteousness
of
the
father
like
his
sins
is
sometimes
visited
on
the
now
why
were
the
two
ecclesiastics
so
uncanonically
kind
to
this
wicked
youth
perhaps
because
both
the
old
bachelors
were
wishing
from
their
hearts
that
they
had
just
such
a
son
of
their
own
and
beside
earl
leofric
was
a
very
great
man
indeed
and
the
wind
might
change
for
it
is
an
unstable
world
only
mind
one
thing
said
the
naughty
boy
as
he
dismounted
and
halloed
to
a
to
see
to
his
horse
don
t
let
me
see
the
face
of
that
and
why
you
have
wronged
him
and
he
will
forgive
you
doubtless
like
a
good
christian
as
he
that
is
his
concern
but
if
i
see
him
i
cut
off
his
head
and
as
uncle
brand
knows
i
always
sleep
with
my
sword
under
my
o
that
such
a
mother
should
have
borne
such
a
groaned
the
abbot
as
they
went
in
on
the
fifth
day
came
martin
lightfoot
and
found
hereward
in
prior
brand
s
private
cell
well
asked
hereward
coolly
is
he
is
he
stammered
brand
and
could
not
finish
his
sentence
martin
nodded
hereward
laughed
a
loud
swaggering
hysterical
laugh
see
what
it
is
to
be
born
of
just
and
pious
parents
come
master
speak
out
and
tell
us
all
about
it
thy
lean
wolf
s
legs
have
run
to
some
purpose
open
thy
lean
wolf
s
mouth
and
speak
for
once
lest
i
ease
thy
legs
for
the
rest
of
thy
life
by
a
cut
across
the
hams
find
thy
lost
tongue
i
say
walls
have
ears
as
well
as
the
said
martin
we
are
safe
here
said
the
prior
so
speak
and
tell
us
the
whole
well
when
the
earl
read
the
letter
he
turned
red
and
pale
again
and
then
naught
but
men
follow
me
to
the
king
at
so
we
went
all
with
our
weapons
twenty
or
more
along
the
strand
and
up
into
the
king
s
new
hall
and
a
grand
hall
it
is
but
not
easy
to
get
into
for
the
crowd
of
monks
and
beggars
on
the
stairs
hindering
honest
folks
business
and
there
sat
the
king
on
a
high
settle
with
his
pink
face
and
white
hair
looking
as
royal
as
a
new
washed
and
on
either
side
of
him
on
the
same
settle
sat
the
old
fox
and
the
young
godwin
and
harold
and
where
was
the
queen
sitting
on
a
stool
at
his
feet
with
her
hands
together
as
if
she
were
praying
and
her
eyes
downcast
as
demure
as
any
cat
and
so
is
fulfilled
the
story
how
the
went
out
to
get
married
and
left
the
fox
the
wolf
and
the
cat
to
guard
the
if
thou
hast
found
thy
tongue
said
brand
thou
art
like
enough
to
lose
it
again
by
slice
of
knife
talking
such
ribaldry
of
dignities
dost
not
know
and
he
sank
his
voice
that
abbot
leofric
is
earl
harold
s
man
and
that
harold
himself
made
him
abbot
i
said
walls
have
ears
it
was
you
who
told
me
that
we
were
safe
however
i
will
bridle
the
unruly
and
he
went
on
and
your
father
walked
up
the
hall
his
left
hand
on
his
looking
an
earl
all
over
as
he
he
is
that
said
hereward
in
a
low
voice
and
he
bowed
and
the
most
magnificent
powerful
and
virtuous
godwin
would
have
beckoned
him
up
to
sit
on
the
high
settle
but
he
looked
straight
at
the
king
as
if
there
were
never
a
godwin
or
a
godwinsson
on
earth
and
cried
as
he
stood
justice
my
lord
the
king
and
at
that
the
king
turned
pale
and
said
who
what
o
miserable
world
o
last
days
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
o
earth
full
of
violence
and
blood
who
has
wronged
thee
now
most
dear
and
noble
earl
justice
against
my
own
at
that
the
fox
looked
at
the
wolf
and
the
wolf
at
the
fox
and
if
they
did
not
smile
it
was
not
for
want
of
will
i
warrant
but
your
father
went
on
and
told
all
his
story
and
when
he
came
to
your
robbing
master
monk
o
apostate
cries
the
o
spawn
of
beelzebub
excommunicate
him
with
bell
book
and
candle
may
he
be
thrust
down
with
korah
balaam
and
iscariot
to
the
most
stygian
pot
of
the
sempiternal
and
at
that
your
father
smiled
that
is
bishops
work
says
he
and
i
want
king
s
work
from
you
lord
king
outlaw
me
this
young
rebel
s
sinful
body
as
by
law
you
can
and
leave
his
sinful
soul
to
the
priests
or
to
god
s
mercy
which
is
like
to
be
more
than
then
the
queen
looked
up
your
own
son
noble
earl
think
of
what
you
are
doing
and
one
whom
all
say
is
so
gallant
and
so
fair
o
persuade
him
father
persuade
him
harold
my
brother
or
if
you
can
not
persuade
him
persuade
the
king
at
least
and
save
this
poor
youth
from
puss
knew
well
enough
said
hereward
in
a
low
voice
that
the
way
to
harden
my
father
s
heart
was
to
set
godwin
and
harold
on
softening
it
they
ask
my
pardon
from
the
king
i
would
not
take
it
at
their
asking
even
if
my
father
there
spoke
a
true
leofricsson
said
brand
in
spite
of
himself
by
the
and
martin
repeated
a
certain
very
solemn
oath
said
your
father
justice
i
will
have
my
lord
king
who
talks
to
me
of
my
own
son
you
put
me
into
my
earldom
to
see
justice
done
and
law
obeyed
and
how
shall
i
make
others
keep
within
bound
if
i
am
not
to
keep
in
my
own
flesh
and
blood
here
is
this
land
running
headlong
to
ruin
because
every
nobleman
ay
every
churl
who
owns
a
manor
if
he
dares
must
needs
arm
and
saddle
and
levy
war
on
his
own
behalf
and
harry
and
slay
the
king
s
lieges
if
he
have
not
garlic
to
his
roast
goose
every
time
he
chooses
and
there
your
father
did
look
at
godwin
once
and
for
all
and
shall
i
let
my
son
follow
the
fashion
and
do
his
best
to
leave
the
land
open
and
weak
for
norseman
or
dane
or
frenchman
or
whoever
else
hopes
next
to
mount
the
throne
of
a
king
who
is
too
holy
to
leave
an
heir
behind
him
ahoi
martin
the
silent
where
learnt
you
so
suddenly
the
trade
of
preaching
i
thought
you
kept
your
wind
for
your
running
this
two
years
past
you
would
make
as
good
a
talker
among
the
witan
as
godwin
himself
you
give
it
us
all
word
for
word
and
voice
and
gesture
withal
as
if
you
were
king
edward
s
french
martin
smiled
i
am
like
falada
the
horse
my
lords
who
could
only
speak
to
his
own
true
princess
why
i
held
my
tongue
of
late
was
only
lest
they
should
cut
my
head
off
for
talking
as
they
did
poor
falada
thou
art
a
very
crafty
knave
said
brand
and
hast
had
in
thy
time
i
can
see
and
made
bad
use
of
it
i
misdoubt
very
much
that
thou
art
some
runaway
that
am
i
not
by
peter
s
chains
said
martin
in
an
eager
terrified
voice
lord
hereward
i
came
hither
as
your
father
s
messenger
and
servant
you
will
see
me
safe
out
of
this
abbey
like
an
honorable
gentleman
i
will
all
i
know
of
him
uncle
is
that
he
used
to
tell
me
stories
when
i
was
a
boy
of
enchanters
and
knights
and
dragons
and
such
like
and
got
into
trouble
for
filling
my
head
with
such
fancies
now
let
him
tell
his
story
in
he
shall
but
i
misdoubt
the
fellow
very
much
he
talks
as
if
he
knew
latin
and
what
business
has
a
slave
to
do
that
so
martin
went
on
somewhat
abashed
and
said
your
father
justice
i
will
have
and
leave
injustice
and
the
overlooking
of
it
to
those
who
wish
to
profit
and
at
that
godwin
smiled
and
said
to
the
king
the
earl
is
wise
as
usual
and
speaks
like
a
very
solomon
your
majesty
must
in
spite
of
your
own
tenderness
of
heart
have
these
letters
of
outlawry
made
then
all
our
men
murmured
and
i
as
loud
as
any
but
old
surturbrand
the
housecarle
did
more
for
out
he
stepped
to
your
father
s
side
and
spoke
right
up
before
the
king
bonny
times
he
said
i
have
lived
to
see
when
a
lad
of
earl
oslac
s
blood
is
sent
out
of
the
land
a
beggar
and
a
wolf
s
head
for
playing
a
boy
s
trick
or
two
and
upsetting
a
shaveling
priest
we
managed
such
wild
young
colts
better
we
vikings
who
conquered
the
danelagh
if
canute
had
had
a
son
like
hereward
as
would
to
god
he
had
had
he
would
have
dealt
with
him
as
old
swend
forkbeard
god
grant
i
meet
him
in
valhalla
in
spite
of
all
priests
did
by
canute
himself
when
he
was
young
and
kicked
and
plunged
awhile
at
being
first
bitted
and
what
does
the
man
say
asked
the
king
for
old
surturbrand
was
talking
broad
danish
he
is
a
housecarle
of
mine
lord
king
a
good
man
and
true
but
old
age
and
rough
danish
blood
has
made
him
forget
that
he
stands
before
kings
and
by
earl
says
surturbrand
i
have
fought
knee
to
knee
beside
a
braver
king
than
that
there
and
nobler
earls
than
ever
a
one
here
and
was
never
afraid
like
a
free
dane
to
speak
my
mind
to
them
by
sea
or
land
and
if
the
king
with
his
french
ways
does
not
understand
a
plain
man
s
talk
the
two
earls
yonder
do
right
well
and
i
say
deal
by
this
lad
in
the
good
old
fashion
give
him
half
a
dozen
long
ships
and
what
crews
he
can
get
together
and
send
him
out
as
canute
would
have
done
to
seek
his
fortune
like
a
viking
and
if
he
comes
home
with
plenty
of
wounds
and
plenty
of
plunder
give
him
an
earldom
as
he
deserves
do
you
ask
your
countess
earl
godwin
she
is
of
the
right
danish
blood
god
bless
her
though
she
is
your
wife
and
see
if
she
does
not
know
how
to
bring
a
naughty
lad
to
his
then
harold
the
earl
said
the
old
man
is
right
king
listen
to
what
he
and
he
told
him
all
quite
how
did
you
know
that
can
you
understand
french
i
am
a
poor
idiot
give
me
a
halfpenny
said
martin
in
a
doleful
voice
as
he
threw
into
his
face
and
whole
figure
a
look
of
helpless
stupidity
and
awkwardness
which
set
them
both
laughing
but
hereward
checked
himself
and
you
think
he
was
in
earnest
as
sure
as
there
are
holy
crows
in
crowland
but
it
was
of
no
use
your
father
got
a
parchment
with
an
outlandish
norman
seal
hanging
to
it
and
sent
me
off
with
it
that
same
night
to
give
to
the
lawman
so
wolf
s
head
you
are
my
lord
and
there
is
no
use
crying
over
spilt
and
harold
spoke
for
me
it
will
be
as
well
to
tell
abbot
leofric
that
in
case
he
be
inclined
to
turn
traitor
and
refuse
to
open
the
gates
once
outside
them
i
care
not
for
mortal
my
poor
boy
there
will
be
many
a
one
whom
thou
hast
wronged
only
too
ready
to
lie
in
wait
for
thee
now
thy
life
is
in
every
man
s
hand
if
the
outlawry
is
published
thou
hadst
best
start
and
get
past
lincoln
before
i
shall
stay
quietly
here
and
get
a
good
night
s
rest
and
then
ride
out
morning
in
the
face
of
the
whole
shire
no
not
a
word
you
would
not
have
me
sneak
away
like
a
coward
brand
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
being
very
much
of
the
same
mind
at
least
go
and
why
north
you
have
no
quarrel
in
northumberland
and
the
king
s
writ
runs
very
slowly
there
if
at
all
old
siward
digre
may
stand
your
he
he
is
a
fast
friend
of
my
father
what
of
that
the
old
viking
will
like
you
none
the
less
for
having
shown
a
touch
of
his
own
temper
go
to
him
i
say
and
tell
him
that
i
sent
but
he
is
fighting
the
scots
beyond
the
so
much
the
better
there
will
be
good
work
for
you
to
do
and
gislebert
of
ghent
is
up
there
too
i
hear
trying
to
settle
himself
among
the
scots
he
is
your
mother
s
kinsman
and
as
for
your
being
an
outlaw
he
wants
hard
hitters
and
hard
riders
and
all
is
fish
that
comes
to
his
net
find
him
out
too
and
tell
him
i
sent
you
are
a
good
old
uncle
said
hereward
why
were
you
not
a
soldier
brand
laughed
somewhat
sadly
if
i
had
been
a
soldier
lad
where
would
you
have
looked
for
a
friend
this
day
no
god
has
done
what
was
merciful
with
me
and
my
sins
may
he
do
the
same
by
thee
and
hereward
made
an
impatient
movement
he
disliked
any
word
which
seemed
likely
to
soften
his
own
hardness
of
heart
but
he
kissed
his
uncle
lovingly
on
both
cheeks
by
the
by
martin
any
message
from
my
lady
mother
none
quite
right
and
pious
i
am
an
enemy
to
holy
church
and
therefore
to
her
good
night
hey
asked
brand
where
is
that
footman
martin
you
call
him
i
must
have
another
word
with
but
martin
was
gone
no
matter
i
shall
question
him
sharply
enough
i
and
hereward
went
out
to
his
lodging
while
the
good
prior
went
to
his
prayers
when
hereward
entered
his
room
martin
started
out
of
the
darkness
and
followed
him
in
then
he
shut
to
the
door
carefully
and
pulled
out
a
bag
there
was
no
message
from
my
lady
but
there
was
the
bag
was
full
of
money
why
did
you
not
tell
me
of
this
before
never
show
money
before
a
villain
would
you
mistrust
my
uncle
any
man
with
a
shaven
crown
peter
is
his
god
and
lord
and
conscience
and
if
he
saw
but
the
shine
of
a
penny
for
peter
he
would
want
and
he
shall
have
it
quoth
hereward
and
flung
out
of
the
room
and
into
his
uncle
s
uncle
i
have
money
i
am
come
to
pay
back
what
i
took
from
the
steward
and
as
much
more
into
the
and
he
told
out
pieces
thank
god
and
all
his
saints
cried
brand
weeping
abundantly
for
joy
for
he
had
acquired
by
long
devotion
the
that
lachrymose
and
somewhat
hysterical
temperament
common
among
pious
monks
and
held
to
be
a
mark
of
grace
blessed
peter
thou
art
repaid
and
thou
wilt
be
merciful
brand
believed
in
common
with
all
monks
then
that
hereward
had
robbed
not
merely
the
abbey
of
peterborough
but
what
was
more
peter
himself
thereby
converting
into
an
implacable
and
internecine
foe
the
chief
of
the
apostles
the
rock
on
which
was
founded
the
whole
church
now
uncle
said
hereward
do
me
one
good
deed
in
return
promise
me
that
if
you
can
help
it
none
of
my
poor
housecarles
shall
suffer
for
my
sins
i
led
them
into
trouble
i
am
punished
i
have
made
restitution
at
least
to
peter
see
that
my
father
and
mother
if
they
be
the
christians
they
call
themselves
forgive
and
forget
all
offences
except
i
will
so
help
me
all
saints
and
our
lord
o
my
boy
my
boy
thou
shouldst
have
been
a
king
s
thane
and
not
an
outlaw
and
he
hurried
off
with
the
news
to
the
abbot
when
hereward
returned
to
his
room
martin
was
gone
farewell
good
men
of
peterborough
said
hereward
as
he
leapt
into
the
saddle
next
morning
i
had
made
a
vow
against
you
and
came
to
try
you
to
see
whether
you
would
force
me
to
fulfil
it
or
not
but
you
have
been
so
kind
that
i
have
half
repented
of
it
and
the
evil
shall
not
come
in
the
days
of
abbot
leofric
nor
of
brand
the
prior
though
it
may
come
in
the
days
of
herluin
the
steward
if
he
live
long
what
do
you
mean
you
incarnate
fiend
only
fit
to
worship
thor
and
odin
asked
brand
that
i
would
burn
goldenborough
and
herluin
the
steward
within
it
ere
i
die
i
fear
i
shall
do
it
i
fear
i
must
do
it
ten
years
ago
come
lammas
herluin
bade
light
the
under
me
do
you
recollect
and
so
he
did
the
hound
quoth
brand
i
had
forgotten
little
hereward
never
forgets
foe
or
friend
ever
since
on
lammas
night
hold
still
horse
i
dream
of
fire
and
flame
and
of
goldenborough
in
the
glare
of
it
if
it
is
written
in
the
big
book
happen
it
must
if
not
so
much
the
better
for
goldenborough
for
it
is
a
pretty
place
and
honest
englishmen
in
it
only
see
that
there
be
not
too
many
frenchmen
crept
in
when
i
come
back
beside
our
french
friend
herluin
and
see
too
that
there
be
not
a
handy
a
word
is
enough
to
wise
men
like
you
good
by
god
help
thee
thou
sinful
boy
said
the
abbot
hereward
hereward
come
back
cried
brand
but
the
boy
had
spurred
his
horse
through
the

this
is
my

penance

i
do

i
persuaded
his

to

him
hither

will

him
who

quoth
the
abbot
and
no
more
he
did
it
was
four
o
clock
on
a
may
morning
when
hereward
set
out
to
see
the
world
with
good
armor
on
his
back
good
weapon
by
his
side
good
horse
between
his
knees
and
good
money
in
his
purse
what
could
a
lad
of
eighteen
want
more
who
under
the
harsh
family
rule
of
those
times
had
known
nothing
of
a
father
s
and
but
too
little
of
a
mother
s
love
he
rode
away
northward
through
the
bruneswald
over
the
higher
land
of
lincolnshire
through
primeval
glades
of
mighty
oak
and
ash
holly
and
thorn
swarming
with
game
which
was
as
highly
preserved
then
as
now
under
canute
s
severe
forest
laws
the
yellow
roes
stood
and
stared
at
him
in
the
young
fern
the
pheasant
called
his
hens
out
to
feed
in
the
dewy
grass
the
blackbird
and
thrush
sang
out
from
every
bough
the
trilled
above
the
high
and
sank
down
on
them
as
his
song
sank
down
and
hereward
rode
on
rejoicing
in
it
all
it
was
a
fine
world
in
the
bruneswald
what
was
it
then
outside
not
to
him
as
to
us
a
world
circular
sailed
round
circumscribed
mapped
botanized
zoologized
a
tiny
planet
about
which
everybody
knows
or
thinks
they
know
everything
but
a
world
infinite
magical
supernatural
because
unknown
a
vast
flat
plain
reaching
no
one
knew
whence
or
where
save
that
the
mountains
stood
on
the
four
corners
thereof
to
keep
it
steady
and
the
four
winds
of
heaven
blew
out
of
them
and
in
the
centre
which
was
to
him
the
bruneswald
such
things
as
he
saw

beyond

unspeakable
dragons

no
he
would
go
off
to

and
join
bruce

and
the
vikings
of
the
northern
seas
and
all
the

found
even

hot
to
hold

to
iceland
and

and
the
sunny
lands
which
they
said
lay
even
beyond
across
the
all
but
unknown
ocean
he
would
go
up
the
baltic
to
the
jomsburg
vikings
and
fight
against
lett
and
esthonian
heathen
and
pierce
inland
perhaps
through
puleyn
and
the
bison
forests
to
the
land
from
whence
came
the
magic
swords
and
the
old
persian
coins
which
he
had
seen
so
often
in
the
halls
of
his
forefathers
no
he
would
go
south
to
the
land
of
sun
and
wine
and
see
the
magicians
of
cordova
and
seville
and
beard
mussulman
hounds
worshipping
their
mahomets
and
perhaps
bring
home
an
emir
s
daughter
with
more
gay
gold
about
her
middle
than
would
buy
half
or
he
would
go
up
the
straits
and
on
to
constantinople
and
the
great
kaiser
of
the
greeks
and
join
the
varanger
guard
and
perhaps
like
harold
hardraade
in
his
own
days
after
being
cast
to
the
lion
for
carrying
off
a
fair
greek
lady
tear
out
the
monster
s
tongue
with
his
own

and
show
the

what
a
viking
s
son
could
do
and
as
he
dreamed
of
the
infinite
world
and
its
infinite
wonders
the
enchanters
he
might
meet
the
jewels
he
might
find
the
adventures
he
might
essay
he
held
that
he
must
succeed
in
all
with
hope
and
wit
and
a
strong
arm
and
forgot
altogether
that
mixed
up
with
the
cosmogony
of
an
infinite
flat
plain
called
the
earth
there
was
joined
also
the
belief
in
a
flat
roof
above
called
heaven
on
which
seen
at
times
in
visions
through
clouds
and
stars
sat
saints
angels
and
archangels
forevermore
harping
on
their
golden
harps
and
knowing
neither
vanity
nor
vexation
of
spirit
lust
nor
pride
murder
nor
war
and
underneath
a
floor
the
name
whereof
was
hell
the
mouths
whereof
as
all
men
knew
might
be
seen
on
hecla
and
aetna
and
stromboli
and
the
fiends
heard
within
tormenting
amid
fire
and
smoke
and
clanking
chains
the
souls
of
the
eternally
lost
as
he
rode
on
slowly
though
cheerfully
as
a
man
who
will
not
tire
his
horse
at
the
beginning
of
a
long
day
s
journey
and
knows
not
where
he
shall
pass
the
night
he
was
aware
of
a
man
on
foot
coming
up
behind
him
at
a
slow
steady
loping
trot
which
in
spite
of
its
slowness
gained
ground
on
him
so
fast
that
he
saw
at
once
that
the
man
could
be
no
common
runner
the
man
came
up
and
behold
he
was
none
other
than
martin
lightfoot
what
art
thou
here
asked
hereward
suspiciously
and
half
cross
at
seeing
any
visitor
from
the
old
world
which
he
had
just
cast
off
how
gottest
thou
out
of
peter
s
last
night
martin
s
tongue
was
hanging
out
of
his
mouth
like
a
running
hound
s
but
he
seemed
like
a
hound
to
perspire
through
his
mouth
for
he
answered
without
the
least
sign
of
distress
without
even
pulling
in
his
tongue
over
the
wall
the
moment
the
prior
s
back
was
turned
i
was
not
going
to
wait
till
i
was
chained
up
in
some
rat
with
a
of
iron
on
my
leg
and
flogged
till
i
confessed
that
i
was
what
i
am
not
a
runaway
and
why
art
here
because
i
am
going
with
going
with
me
said
hereward
what
can
i
do
for
thee
i
can
do
for
you
said
martin
what
groom
your
horse
wash
your
shirt
clean
your
weapons
find
your
inn
fight
your
enemies
cheat
your
friends
anything
and
everything
you
are
going
to
see
the
world
i
am
going
with
thou
canst
be
my
servant
a
right
slippery
one
i
expect
said
hereward
looking
down
on
him
with
some
suspicion
some
are
not
the
rogues
they
seem
i
can
keep
my
secrets
and
yours
before
i
can
trust
thee
with
my
secrets
i
shall
expect
to
know
some
of
thine
said
hereward
martin
lightfoot
looked
up
with
a
cunning
smile
a
servant
can
always
know
his
master
s
secrets
if
he
likes
but
that
is
no
reason
a
master
should
know
his
servant
thou
shalt
tell
me
thine
man
or
i
shall
ride
off
and
leave
not
so
easy
my
lord
where
that
heavy
horse
can
go
martin
lightfoot
can
follow
but
i
will
tell
you
one
secret
which
i
never
told
to
living
man
i
can
read
and
write
like
any
thou
read
and
write
ay
good
latin
enough
and
irish
too
what
is
more
and
now
because
i
love
you
and
because
you
i
will
serve
willy
nilly
i
will
tell
you
all
the
secrets
i
have
as
long
as
my
breath
lasts
for
my
tongue
is
rather
stiff
after
that
long
story
about
the
i
was
born
in
ireland
in
waterford
town
my
mother
was
an
english
slave
one
of
those
that
earl
godwin
s
wife
not
this
one
that
is
now
gyda
but
the
old
one
king
canute
s
sister
used
to
sell
out
of
england
by
the
score
tied
together
with
ropes
boys
and
girls
from
bristol
town
her
master
my
father
that
was
i
shall
know
him
again
got
tired
of
her
and
wanted
to
give
her
away
to
one
of
his
kernes
she
would
not
have
that
so
he
hung
her
up
hand
and
foot
and
beat
her
that
she
died
there
was
an
abbey
hard
by
and
the
church
laid
on
him
a
penance
all
that
they
dared
get
out
of
him
that
he
should
give
me
to
the
monks
being
then
a
boy
well
i
grew
up
in
that
abbey
they
taught
me
my
fa
fa
mi
fa
but
i
liked
better
conning
of
ballads
and
hearing
stories
of
ghosts
and
enchanters
such
as
i
used
to
tell
you
i
ll
tell
you
plenty
more
whenever
you
re
tired
then
they
made
me
work
and
that
i
never
could
abide
at
all
then
they
beat
me
every
day
and
that
i
could
abide
still
less
but
always
i
stuck
to
my
book
for
one
thing
i
saw
that
learning
is
power
my
lord
and
that
the
reason
why
the
monks
are
masters
of
the
land
is
they
are
scholars
and
you
fighting
men
are
none
then
i
fell
in
love
as
young
blood
will
with
an
irish
lass
when
i
was
full
seventeen
years
old
and
when
they
found
out
that
they
held
me
down
on
the
floor
and
beat
me
till
i
was
wellnigh
dead
they
put
me
in
prison
for
a
month
and
between
and
darkness
i
went
nigh
foolish
they
let
me
out
thinking
i
could
do
no
more
harm
to
man
or
lass
and
when
i
found
out
how
profitable
folly
was
foolish
i
remained
at
least
as
foolish
as
seemed
good
to
me
but
one
night
i
got
into
the
abbey
church
stole
therefrom
that
which
i
have
with
me
now
and
which
shall
serve
you
and
me
in
good
stead
yet
out
and
away
aboard
a
ship
among
the
buscarles
and
off
into
the
norway
sea
but
after
a
voyage
or
two
so
it
befell
i
was
wrecked
in
the
wash
by
botulfston
deeps
and
begging
my
way
inland
met
with
your
father
and
took
service
with
him
as
i
have
taken
service
now
with
now
what
has
made
thee
take
service
with
me
because
you
are
give
me
none
of
your
parables
and
dark
sayings
but
speak
out
like
a
man
what
canst
see
in
me
that
thou
shouldest
share
an
outlaw
s
fortune
with
me
i
had
run
away
from
a
monastery
so
had
you
i
hated
the
monks
so
did
you
i
liked
to
tell
stories
since
i
found
good
to
shut
my
mouth
i
tell
them
to
myself
all
day
long
sometimes
all
night
too
when
i
found
out
you
liked
to
hear
them
i
loved
you
all
the
more
then
they
told
me
not
to
speak
to
you
i
held
my
tongue
i
bided
my
time
i
knew
you
would
be
outlawed
some
day
i
knew
you
would
turn
viking
and
and
kill
giants
and
enchanters
and
win
yourself
honor
and
glory
and
i
knew
i
should
have
my
share
in
it
i
knew
you
would
need
me
some
day
and
you
need
me
now
and
here
i
am
and
if
you
try
to
cut
me
down
with
your
sword
i
will
dodge
you
and
follow
you
and
dodge
you
again
till
i
force
you
to
let
me
be
your
man
for
with
you
i
will
live
and
die
and
now
i
can
talk
no
and
with
me
thou
shalt
live
and
die
said
hereward
pulling
up
his
horse
and
frankly
holding
out
his
hand
to
his
new
friend
martin
lightfoot
took
his
hand
kissed
it
licked
it
almost
as
a
dog
would
have
done
i
am
your
man
he
said
amen
and
true
man
i
will
prove
to
you
if
you
will
prove
true
to
and
he
dropped
quietly
back
behind
hereward
s
horse
as
if
the
business
of
his
life
was
settled
and
his
mind
utterly
at
rest
there
is
one
more
likeness
between
us
said
hereward
after
a
few
minutes
thought
if
i
have
robbed
a
church
thou
hast
robbed
one
too
what
is
this
precious
spoil
which
is
to
serve
me
and
thee
in
such
mighty
stead
martin
drew
from
inside
his
shirt
and
under
his
waistband
a
small
and
handed
it
up
to
hereward
it
was
a
tool
the
like
of
which
in
shape
hereward
had
seldom
seen
and
never
its
equal
in
beauty
the
handle
was
some
fifteen
inches
long
made
of
thick
strips
of
black
whalebone
curiously
bound
with
silver
and
butted
with
narwhal
ivory
this
handle
was
evidently
the
work
of
some
cunning
norseman
of
old
but
who
was
the
maker
of
the
blade
it
was
some
eight
inches
long
with
a
sharp
edge
on
one
side
a
sharp
crooked
pick
on
the
other
of
the
finest
steel
inlaid
with
strange
characters
in
gold
the
work
probably
of
some
circassian
tartar
or
persian
such
a
as
rustum
or
zohrab
may
have
wielded
in
fight
upon
the
banks
of
oxus
one
of
those
magic
weapons
brought
men
knew
not
how
out
of
the
magic
east
which
were
hereditary
in
many
a
norse
family
and
sung
of
in
many
a
norse
saga
look
at
it
said
martin
lightfoot
there
is
magic
on
it
it
must
bring
us
luck
whoever
holds
that
must
kill
his
man
it
will
pick
a
lock
of
steel
it
will
crack
a
mail
corslet
as
a
cracks
a
nut
it
will
hew
a
lance
in
two
at
a
single
blow
devils
and
spirits
forged
it
i
know
that
virgilius
the
enchanter
perhaps
or
solomon
the
great
or
whosoever
s
name
is
on
it
graven
there
in
letters
of
gold
handle
it
feel
its
balance
but
no
do
not
handle
it
too
much
there
is
a
devil
in
it
who
would
make
you
kill
me
whenever
i
play
with
it
i
long
to
kill
a
man
it
would
be
so
easy
so
easy
give
it
me
back
my
lord
give
it
me
back
lest
the
devil
come
through
the
handle
into
your
palm
and
possess
hereward
laughed
and
gave
him
back
his
but
he
had
hardly
less
doubt
of
the
magic
virtues
of
such
a
blade
than
had
martin
himself
magical
or
not
thou
wilt
not
have
to
hit
a
man
twice
with
that
martin
my
lad
so
we
two
outlaws
are
both
well
armed
and
having
neither
wife
nor
child
land
nor
beeves
to
lose
ought
to
be
a
match
for
any
six
honest
men
who
may
have
a
grudge
against
us
and
sound
reasons
at
home
for
running
and
so
those
two
went
northward
through
the
green
bruneswald
and
northward
again
through
merry
sherwood
and
were
not
seen
in
that
land

let
antiquaries
decide
of
dunkeld
and
of
duncan
and
of
siward
and
of
the
outraged
sibilla
he
may
have
helped
himself
to
bring
birnam
wood
to
dunsinane
on
the
day
of
the
seven
sleepers
and
heard
siward
when
his
son
asbiorn
s
corpse
was
carried
into
camp
footnote
shakespeare
makes
young
siward
his
son
he
too
was
slain
in
the
battle
but
he
was
siward
s
nephew
ask
only
has
he
all
his
wounds
in
front
he
may
have
seen
old
siward
after
macbeth
s
defeat
not
death
as
shakespeare
relates
the
story
go
back
to
northumbria
with
such
booty
as
no
man
had
obtained
before
a
proof
if
the
fact
be
fact
that
the
scotch
lowlands
were
not
in
the
eleventh
century
the
poor
and
barbarous
country
which
some
have
reported
them
to
have
been
all
this
is
not
only
possible
but
probable
enough
the
dates
considered
the
chroniclers
however
are
silent
they
only
say
that
hereward
was
in
those
days
beyond
northumberland
with
gisebert
of
ghent
gisebert
gislebert
gilbert
guibert
goisbricht
of
ghent
who
afterwards
owned
by
chance
of
war
many
a
fair
manor
about
lincoln
city
was
one
of
those
valiant
flemings
who
settled
along
the
east
and
northeast
coast
of
scotland
in
the
eleventh
century
they
fought
with
the
celtic
princes
and
then
married
with
their
daughters
got
to
themselves
lands
by
the
of
the
sword
and
so
became
the
famous
freskin
the
fleming
especially
the
ancestors
of
the
finest
aristocracy
both
physically
and
intellectually
in
the
world
they
had
their
connections
moreover
with
the
norman
court
of
rouen
through
the
duchess
matilda
daughter
of
their
old
seigneur
baldwin
marquis
of
flanders
their
connections
too
with
the
english
court
through
countess
judith
wife
of
earl
tosti
godwinsson
another
daughter
of
baldwin
s
their
friendship
was
sought
their
enmity
feared
far
and
wide
throughout
the
north
they
seem
to
have
been
civilizers
and
cultivators
and
traders
with
the
instinct
of
true
flemings
as
well
as
conquerors
they
were
in
those
very
days
bringing
to
order
and
tillage
the
rich
lands
of
the
from
the
frith
of
moray
to
that
of
forth
and
forming
a
rampart
for
scotland
against
the
invasions
of
sweyn
hardraade
and
all
the
wild
vikings
of
the
northern
seas
amongst
them
in
those
days
gilbert
of
ghent
seems
to
have
been
a
notable
personage
to
judge
from
the
great
house
which
he
kept
and
the
tyrones
or
squires
in
training
for
the
honor
of
knighthood
who
fed
at
his
table
where
he
lived
the
chroniclers
report
not
to
them
the
country
ultra
northumbriam
beyond
the
forth
was
as
russia
or
cathay
where
geographers
on
pathless
downs
put
elephants
for
want
of
as
indeed
it
was
to
that
french
who
as
late
as
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
not
having
been
to
aberdeen
or
elgin
leaves
all
the
country
north
of
the
tay
a
blank
with
the
inscription
inculte
et
sauvage
habitée
par
les
wherever
gilbert
lived
however
he
heard
that
hereward
was
outlawed
and
sent
for
him
says
the
story
and
there
he
lived
doubtless
happily
enough
fighting
highlanders
and
hunting
deer
so
that
as
yet
the
pains
and
penalties
of
exile
did
not
press
very
hardly
upon
him
the
handsome
petulant
lad
had
become
in
a
few
weeks
the
darling
of
gilbert
s
ladies
and
the
envy
of
all
his
knights
and
gentlemen
hereward
the
singer
dancer
hereward
the
rider
and
hunter
was
in
all
mouths
but
he
himself
was
discontented
at
having
as
yet
fallen
in
with
no
adventure
worthy
of
a
man
and
looked
curiously
and
longingly
at
the
menagerie
of
wild
beasts
enclosed
in
strong
wooden
cages
which
gilbert
kept
in
one
corner
of
the
great
not
for
any
scientific
purposes
but
to
try
with
them
at
christmas
easter
and
whitsuntide
the
mettle
of
the
young
gentlemen
who
were
candidates
for
the
honor
of
knighthood
but
after
looking
over
the
bulls
and
stags
wolves
and
bears
hereward
settled
it
in
his
mind
that
there
was
none
worthy
of
his
steel
save
one
huge
white
bear
whom
no
man
had
yet
dared
to
face
and
whom
hereward
indeed
had
never
seen
hidden
as
he
was
all
day
within
the
old
pict
s
house
of
stone
which
had
been
turned
into
his
den
there
was
a
mystery
about
the
uncanny
brute
which
charmed
hereward
he
was
said
to
be
perhaps
wholly
human
to
be
the
son
of
the
fairy
bear
near
kinsman
if
not
uncle
or
cousin
of
siward
digre
he
had
like
his
fairy
father
iron
claws
he
had
human
intellect
and
understood
human
speech
and
the
arts
of
war
at
least
so
all
in
the
place
believed
and
not
as
absurdly
as
at
first
sight
seems
for
the
brown
bear
and
much
more
the
white
was
among
the
northern
nations
in
himself
a
creature
magical
and
superhuman
he
is
god
s
dog
whispered
the
lapp
and
called
him
the
old
man
in
the
fur
cloak
afraid
to
use
his
right
name
even
inside
the
tent
for
fear
of
his
overhearing
and
avenging
the
insult
he
has
twelve
men
s
strength
and
eleven
men
s
wit
sang
the
norseman
and
prided
himself
accordingly
like
a
true
norseman
on
outwitting
and
slaying
the
enchanted
monster
terrible
was
the
brown
bear
but
more
terrible
the
white
as
the
saxons
called
him
the
hound
of
hrymir
the
whale
s
bane
the
seal
s
dread
the
rider
of
the
iceberg
the
sailor
of
the
floe
who
ranged
for
his
prey
under
the
six
months
night
lighted
by
surtur
s
fires
even
to
the
gates
of
muspelheim
to
slay
him
was
a
feat
worthy
of
beowulf
s
self
and
the
greatest
wonder
perhaps
among
all
the
wealth
of
crowland
was
the
twelve
white
which
lay
before
the
altars
the
gift
of
the
great
canute
how
gilbert
had
obtained
his
white
bear
and
why
he
kept
him
there
in
durance
vile
was
a
mystery
over
which
men
shook
their
heads
again
and
again
hereward
asked
his
host
to
let
him
try
his
strength
against
the
monster
of
the
north
again
and
again
the
shrieks
of
the
ladies
and
gilbert
s
own
pity
for
the
stripling
youth
brought
a
refusal
but
hereward
settled
it
in
his
heart
nevertheless
that
somehow
or
other
when
christmas
time
came
round
he
would
extract
from
gilbert
drunk
or
sober
leave
to
fight
that
bear
and
then
either
make
himself
a
name
or
die
like
a
man
meanwhile
hereward
made
a
friend
among
all
the
ladies
of
gilbert
s
household
however
kind
they
were
inclined
to
be
to
him
he
took
a
fancy
but
to
one
and
that
was
to
a
little
girl
of
eight
years
old
alftruda
was
her
name
he
liked
to
amuse
himself
with
this
child
without
as
he
fancied
any
danger
of
falling
in
love
for
already
his
dreams
of
love
were
of
the
highest
and
most
fantastic
and
an
emir
s
daughter
or
a
princess
of
constantinople
were
the
very
lowest
game
at
which
he
meant
to
fly
alftruda
was
beautiful
too
exceedingly
and
precocious
and
it
may
be
vain
enough
to
repay
his
attentions
in
good
earnest
moreover
she
was
english
as
he
was
and
royal
likewise
a
relation
of
elfgiva
daughter
of
ethelred
once
king
of
england
who
as
all
know
married
uchtred
prince
of
northumberland
and
grandfather
of
gospatrick
earl
of
northumberland
and
ancestor
of
all
the
dunbars
between
the
english
lad
then
and
the
english
maiden
grew
up
in
a
few
weeks
an
innocent
friendship
which
had
almost
become
more
than
friendship
through
the
intervention
of
the
fairy
bear
for
as
hereward
was
coming
in
one
afternoon
from
hunting
hawk
on
fist
with
martin
lightfoot
trotting
behind
crane
and
heron
duck
and
hare
slung
over
his
shoulder
on
reaching
the
gates
he
was
aware
of
screams
and
shouts
within
tumult
and
terror
among
man
and
beast
hereward
tried
to
force
his
horse
in
at
the
gate
the
beast
stopped
and
turned
snorting
with
fear
and
no
wonder
for
in
the
midst
of
the
stood
the
fairy
bear
his
white
mane
bristled
up
till
he
seemed
twice
as
big
as
any
of
the
sober
brown
bears
which
hereward
yet
had
seen
his
long
snake
neck
and
cruel
visage
wreathed
about
in
search
of
prey
a
dead
horse
its
back
broken
by
a
single
blow
of
the
paw
and
two
or
three
writhing
dogs
showed
that
the
beast
had
turned
like
too
many
of
his
human
kindred
the
was
utterly
empty
but
from
the
ladies
bower
came
shrieks
and
shouts
not
only
of
women
but
of
men
and
knocking
at
the
bower
door
adding
her
screams
to
those
inside
was
a
little
white
figure
which
hereward
recognized
as
alftruda
s
they
had
barricaded
themselves
inside
leaving
the
child
out
and
now
dared
not
open
the
door
as
the
bear
swung
and
rolled
towards
it
looking
savagely
right
and
left
for
a
fresh
victim
hereward
leaped
from
his
horse
and
drawing
his
sword
rushed
forward
with
a
shout
which
made
the
bear
turn
round
he
looked
once
back
at
the
child
then
round
again
at
hereward
and
making
up
his
mind
to
take
the
largest
morsel
first
made
straight
at
him
with
a
growl
which
there
was
no
mistaking
he
was
within
two
paces
then
he
rose
on
his
hind
legs
a
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
hereward
and
lifted
the
iron
talons
high
in
air
hereward
knew
that
there
was
but
one
spot
at
which
to
strike
and
he
struck
true
and
strong
before
the
iron
paw
could
fall
right
on
the
muzzle
of
the
monster
he
heard
the
dull
crash
of
the
steel
he
felt
the
sword
jammed
tight
he
shut
his
eyes
for
an
instant
fearing
lest
as
in
dreams
his
blow
had
come
to
naught
lest
his
sword
had
turned
aside
or
melted
like
water
in
his
hand
and
the
next
moment
would
find
him
crushed
to
earth
blinded
and
stunned
something
tugged
at
his
sword
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
huge
carcass
bend
reel
roll
slowly
over
to
one
side
dead
tearing
out
of
his
hand
the
sword
which
was
firmly
fixed
into
the
skull
hereward
stood
awhile
staring
at
the
beast
like
a
man
astonished
at
what
he
himself
had
done
he
had
had
his
first
adventure
and
he
had
conquered
he
was
now
a
champion
in
his
own
right
a
hero
of
the
heroes
one
who
might
take
rank
if
he
went
on
beside
beowulf
frotho
ragnar
lodbrog
or
harald
hardraade
he
had
done
this
deed
what
was
there
after
this
which
he
might
not
do
and
he
stood
there
in
the
fulness
of
his
pride
defiant
of
earth
and
heaven
while
in
his
heart
arose
the
thought
of
that
old
viking
who
cried
in
the
pride
of
his
godlessness
i
never
on
earth
met
him
whom
i
feared
and
why
should
i
fear
him
in
heaven
if
i
met
odin
i
would
fight
with
odin
if
odin
were
the
stronger
he
would
slay
me
if
i
were
the
stronger
i
would
slay
and
there
he
stood
staring
and
dreaming
over
renown
to
come
a
true
pattern
of
the
hero
of
those
rough
times
capable
of
all
vices
except
cowardice
and
capable
too
of
all
virtues
save
humility
do
you
not
see
said
martin
lightfoot
s
voice
close
by
that
there
is
a
fair
lady
trying
to
thank
you
while
you
are
so
rude
or
so
proud
that
you
will
not
vouchsafe
her
one
look
it
was
true
little
alftruda
had
been
clinging
to
him
for
five
minutes
past
he
took
the
child
up
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
with
pure
kisses
which
for
a
moment
softened
his
hard
heart
then
setting
her
down
he
turned
to
martin
i
have
done
it
yes
you
have
done
it
i
spied
you
what
will
the
old
folks
at
home
say
to
this
what
care
i
martin
lightfoot
shook
his
head
and
drew
out
his
knife
what
is
that
for
said
hereward
when
the
master
kills
the
game
the
knave
can
but
skin
it
we
may
sleep
warm
under
this
fur
in
many
a
cold
night
by
sea
and
nay
said
hereward
laughing
when
the
master
kills
the
game
he
must
first
carry
it
home
let
us
take
him
and
set
him
up
against
the
bower
door
there
to
astonish
the
brave
knights
and
stooping
down
he
attempted
to
lift
the
huge
carcass
but
in
vain
at
last
with
martin
s
help
he
got
it
fairly
on
his
shoulders
and
the
two
dragged
their
burden
to
the
bower
and
dashed
it
against
the
door
shouting
with
all
their
might
to
those
within
to
open
it
windows
it
must
be
remembered
were
in
those
days
so
few
and
far
between
that
the
folks
inside
had
remained
quite
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
without
the
door
was
opened
cautiously
enough
and
out
looked
to
the
shame
of
knighthood
be
it
said
two
or
three
knights
who
had
taken
shelter
in
the
bower
with
the
ladies
whatever
they
were
going
to
say
the
ladies
forestalled
for
rushing
out
across
the
prostrate
bear
they
overwhelmed
hereward
with
praises
thanks
and
after
the
straightforward
custom
of
those
days
with
substantial
kisses
you
must
be
knighted
at
once
cried
they
you
have
knighted
yourself
by
that
single
a
pity
then
said
one
of
the
knights
to
the
others
that
he
had
not
given
that
accolade
to
himself
instead
of
to
the
unless
some
means
are
found
said
another
of
taking
down
this
boy
s
conceit
life
will
soon
be
not
worth
having
either
he
must
take
ship
said
a
third
and
look
for
adventures
elsewhere
or
i
martin
lightfoot
heard
those
words
and
knowing
that
envy
and
hatred
like
all
other
vices
in
those
times
were
apt
to
take
very
startling
and
unmistakeable
shapes
kept
his
eye
accordingly
on
those
three
knights
he
must
be
knighted
he
shall
be
knighted
as
soon
as
sir
gilbert
comes
home
said
all
the
ladies
in
chorus
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
said
hereward
with
the
blundering
mock
humility
of
a
boy
that
i
had
done
anything
worthy
of
such
an
honor
i
hope
to
win
my
spurs
by
greater
feats
than
a
burst
of
laughter
from
the
knights
and
gentlemen
followed
how
loud
the
young
bantam
crows
after
his
first
little
scuffle
hark
to
him
what
will
he
do
next
eat
a
dragon
fly
to
the
moon
marry
the
sophy
of
egypt
s
daughter
this
last
touched
hereward
to
the
quick
for
it
was
just
what
he
thought
of
doing
and
his
blood
heated
enough
already
beat
quicker
as
some
one
cried
with
the
evident
intent
of
picking
a
quarrel
that
was
meant
for
us
if
the
man
who
killed
the
bear
has
not
earned
knighthood
what
must
we
be
who
have
not
killed
him
you
understand
his
meaning
gentlemen
don
t
forget
it
hereward
looked
down
and
setting
his
foot
on
the
bear
s
head
wrenched
out
of
it
the
sword
which
he
had
left
till
now
with
pardonable
pride
fast
set
in
the
skull
martin
lightfoot
for
his
part
drew
stealthily
from
his
bosom
the
little
magic
axe
keeping
his
eye
on
the
of
the
last
speaker
the
lady
of
the
house
cried
shame
and
ordered
the
knights
away
with
haughty
words
and
gestures
which
because
they
were
so
well
deserved
only
made
the
quarrel
more
deadly
then
she
commanded
hereward
to
sheathe
his
sword
he
did
so
and
turning
to
the
knights
said
with
all
courtesy
you
mistake
me
sirs
you
were
where
brave
knights
should
be
within
the
beleaguered
fortress
defending
the
ladies
had
you
remained
outside
and
been
eaten
by
the
bear
what
must
have
befallen
them
had
he
burst
open
the
door
as
for
this
little
lass
whom
you
left
outside
she
is
too
young
to
requite
knight
s
prowess
by
lady
s
love
and
therefore
beneath
your
attention
and
only
fit
for
the
care
of
a
boy
like
and
taking
up
alftruda
in
his
arms
he
carried
her
in
and
disappeared
who
now
but
hereward
was
in
all
men
s
mouths
the
minstrels
made
ballads
on
him
the
lasses
sang
his
praises
says
the
chronicler
as
they
danced
upon
the
green
gilbert
s
lady
would
need
give
him
the
seat
and
all
the
honors
of
a
belted
knight
though
knight
he
was
none
and
daily
and
weekly
the
valiant
lad
grew
and
hardened
into
a
valiant
man
and
a
courteous
one
withal
giving
no
offence
himself
and
not
to
take
offence
at
other
men
the
knights
were
civil
enough
to
him
the
ladies
more
than
civil
he
hunted
he
wrestled
he
tilted
he
was
promised
a
chance
of
fighting
for
glory
as
soon
as
a
highland
chief
should
declare
war
against
gilbert
or
drive
off
his
cattle
an
event
which
and
small
blame
to
the
highland
chiefs
happened
every
six
months
no
one
was
so
well
content
with
himself
as
hereward
and
therefore
he
fancied
that
the
world
must
be
equally
content
with
him
and
he
was
much
disconcerted
when
martin
drew
him
aside
one
day
and
whispered
if
i
were
my
lord
i
should
wear
a
mail
shirt
under
my
coat
out
what
the
arrow
that
can
go
through
a
deer
s
bladebone
can
go
through
a
man
who
should
harm
me
any
man
of
the
dozen
who
eat
at
the
same
what
have
i
done
to
them
if
i
had
my
laugh
at
them
they
had
their
laugh
at
me
and
we
are
there
is
another
score
my
lord
which
you
have
forgotten
and
that
is
all
on
your
eh
you
killed
the
bear
do
you
expect
them
to
forgive
you
that
till
they
have
repaid
you
with
interest
pish
you
do
not
want
for
wit
my
lord
use
it
and
think
what
right
has
a
little
boy
like
you
to
come
here
killing
bears
which
grown
men
can
not
kill
what
can
you
expect
but
just
punishment
for
your
insolence
say
a
lance
between
your
shoulders
while
you
stoop
to
drink
as
sigfried
had
for
daring
to
tame
brunhild
and
more
what
right
have
you
to
come
here
and
so
win
the
hearts
of
the
ladies
that
the
lady
of
all
the
ladies
should
say
if
aught
happen
to
my
poor
boy
and
he
can
not
live
long
i
would
adopt
hereward
for
my
own
son
and
show
his
mother
what
a
fool
some
folks
think
her
so
my
lord
put
on
your
mail
shirt
and
take
care
of
narrow
ways
and
sharp
corners
for
it
will
be
tried
that
i
know
before
my
lord
gilbert
comes
back
from
the
highlands
but
by
whom
i
know
not
and
care
little
seeing
that
there
are
half
a
dozen
in
the
house
who
would
be
glad
enough
of
the
hereward
took
his
advice
and
rode
out
with
three
or
four
knights
the
next
morning
into
the
not
afraid
but
angry
and
sad
he
was
not
yet
old
enough
to
estimate
the
virulence
of
envy
to
take
ingratitude
and
treachery
for
granted
he
was
to
learn
the
lesson
then
as
a
wholesome
chastener
to
the
pride
of
success
he
was
to
learn
it
again
in
later
years
as
an
additional
bitterness
in
the
humiliation
of
defeat
and
find
out
as
does
many
a
man
that
if
he
once
fall
or
seem
to
fall
a
hundred
curs
spring
up
to
bark
at
him
who
dared
not
open
their
mouths
while
he
was
on
his
legs
so
they
rode
into
the
forest
and
parted
each
with
his
footman
and
his
dogs
in
search
of
boar
and
deer
and
each
had
his
sport
without
meeting
again
for
some
two
hours
or
more
hereward
and
martin
came
at
last
to
a
narrow
gully
a
murderous
place
enough
huge
roofed
it
in
and
made
a
night
of
noon
high
banks
of
earth
and
great
boulders
walled
it
in
right
and
left
for
twenty
feet
above
the
track
what
with
feet
and
what
with
the
wear
and
tear
of
five
hundred
years
was
a
rut
three
feet
deep
and
two
feet
broad
in
which
no
horse
could
turn
any
other
day
hereward
would
have
cantered
down
it
with
merely
a
tightened
rein
today
he
turned
to
martin
and
said
a
very
fit
and
proper
place
for
this
same
treason
unless
you
have
been
drinking
beer
and
thinking
but
martin
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
a
pebble
thrown
from
the
right
bank
struck
him
and
he
looked
up
martin
s
face
was
peering
through
the
heather
overhead
his
finger
on
his
lips
then
he
pointed
cautiously
first
up
the
pass
then
down
hereward
felt
that
his
sword
was
loose
in
the
sheath
and
then
gripped
his
lance
with
a
heart
beating
but
not
with
fear
the
next
moment
he
heard
the
rattle
of
a
horse
s
hoofs
behind
him
looked
back
and
saw
a
knight
charging
desperately
down
the
gully
his
bow
in
hand
and
arrow
drawn
to
the
head
to
turn
was
impossible
to
stop
even
to
walk
on
was
to
be
ridden
over
and
hurled
to
the
ground
helplessly
to
gain
the
mouth
of
the
gully
and
then
turn
on
his
pursuer
was
his
only
chance
for
the
first
and
almost
the
last
time
in
his
life
he
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
and
ran
away
as
he
went
an
arrow
struck
him
sharply
in
the
back
piercing
the
corslet
but
hardly
entering
the
flesh
as
he
neared
the
mouth
two
other
knights
crashed
their
horses
through
the
brushwood
from
right
and
left
and
stood
awaiting
him
their
spears
ready
to
strike
he
was
caught
in
a
trap
a
shield
might
have
saved
him
but
he
had
none
he
did
not
flinch
dropping
his
reins
and
driving
in
the
spurs
once
more
he
met
them
in
full
shock
with
his
left
hand
he
hurled
aside
the
lance
with
his
right
he
hurled
his
own
with
all
his
force
at
the
foe
and
saw
it
pass
clean
through
the
felon
s
chest
while
his
dropped
and
passed
harmlessly
behind
his
knee
so
much
for
lances
in
front
but
the
knight
behind
would
not
his
sword
the
next
moment
be
through
his
brain
there
was
a
clatter
a
crash
and
looking
back
hereward
saw
horse
and
man
rolling
in
the
rut
and
rolling
with
them
martin
lightfoot
he
had
already
pinned
the
felon
knight
s
head
against
the
steep
bank
and
with
uplifted
axe
was
meditating
a
pick
at
his
face
which
would
have
stopped
alike
his
and
his
fighting
hold
thy
hand
shouted
hereward
let
us
see
who
he
is
and
remember
that
he
is
at
least
a
but
one
that
will
ride
no
more
i
finished
his
horse
s
going
as
i
rolled
down
the
it
was
true
he
had
broken
the
poor
beast
s
leg
with
a
blow
of
the
axe
and
they
had
to
kill
the
horse
out
of
pity
ere
they
left
martin
dragged
his
prisoner
forward
you
cried
hereward
and
i
saved
your
life
three
days
ago
the
knight
answered
nothing
you
will
have
to
walk
home
let
that
be
punishment
enough
for
you
and
he
turned
he
will
have
to
ride
in
a
woodman
s
cart
if
he
have
the
luck
to
find
the
third
knight
had
fled
and
after
him
the
dead
man
s
horse
hereward
and
his
man
rode
home
in
peace
and
the
third
knight
after
trying
vainly
to
walk
a
mile
or
two
fell
and
lay
and
was
fain
to
fulfil
martin
s
prophecy
and
be
brought
home
in
a
cart
to
carry
for
years
after
like
sir
lancelot
the
nickname
of
the
chevalier
de
la
charette
and
so
was
hereward
avenged
of
his
enemies
judicial
even
private
inquiry
into
the
matter
there
was
none
that
gentlemen
should
meet
in
the
forest
and
commit
or
try
to
commit
murder
on
each
other
s
bodies
was
far
too
common
a
mishap
in
the
ages
of
faith
to
stir
up
more
than
an
extra
gossiping
and
cackling
among
the
women
and
an
extra
cursing
and
threatening
among
the
men
and
as
the
former
were
all
but
unanimously
on
hereward
s
side
his
plain
and
honest
story
was
taken
as
it
stood
and
now
fair
lady
said
hereward
to
his
hostess
i
must
thank
you
for
all
your
hospitality
and
bid
you
farewell
forever
and
a
she
wept
and
entreated
him
only
to
stay
till
her
lord
came
back
but
hereward
was
firm
you
lady
and
your
good
lord
will
i
ever
love
and
at
your
service
my
sword
shall
ever
be
but
not
here
ill
blood
i
will
not
make
among
traitors
i
will
not
dwell
i
have
killed
two
of
them
and
shall
have
to
kill
two
of
their
kinsmen
next
and
then
two
more
till
you
have
no
knights
left
and
pity
that
would
be
no
the
world
is
wide
and
there
are
plenty
of
good
fellows
in
it
who
will
welcome
me
without
forcing
me
to
wear
mail
under
my
coat
out
and
he
armed
himself
and
rode
away
great
was
the
weeping
in
the
bower
and
great
the
chuckling
in
the
hall
but
never
saw
they
hereward
again
upon
the
scottish
shore
chapter
iii
how
hereward
succored
a
princess
of
cornwall
the
next
place
in
which
hereward
appeared
was
far
away
on
the
southwest
upon
the
cornish
shore
how
he
came
there
or
after
how
long
the
chronicles
do
not
say
all
that
shall
be
told
is
that
he
went
into
port
on
board
a
merchant
ship
carrying
wine
and
intending
to
bring
back
tin
the
merchants
had
told
him
of
one
alef
a
valiant
or
kinglet
of
those
parts
who
was
indeed
a
distant
connection
of
hereward
himself
having
married
as
did
so
many
of
the
celtic
princes
the
daughter
of
a
danish
of
siward
s
blood
they
told
him
also
that
the
kinglet
increased
his
wealth
not
only
by
the
sale
of
tin
and
of
red
cattle
but
by
a
certain
amount
of
autumnal
piracy
in
company
with
his
danish
from
dublin
and
waterford
and
hereward
who
believed
with
most
englishmen
of
the
east
country
that
cornwall
still
produced
a
fair
crop
of
giants
some
of
them
with
two
and
even
three
heads
had
hopes
that
alef
might
show
him
some
adventure
worthy
of
his
sword
he
sailed
in
therefore
over
a
rolling
bar
between
jagged
points
of
black
rock
and
up
a
tide
river
which
wandered
away
inland
like
a
lake
between
high
green
walls
of
oak
and
ash
till
they
saw
at
the
head
of
the
tide
alef
s
town
nestling
in
a
glen
which
sloped
towards
the
southern
sun
they
discovered
besides
two
ships
drawn
up
upon
the
beach
whose
long
lines
and
beside
the
stoat
carved
on
the
of
one
and
the
adder
on
that
of
the
other
bore
witness
to
the
piratical
habits
of
their
owner
the
merchants
it
seemed
were
well
known
to
the
cornishmen
on
shore
and
hereward
went
up
with
them
unopposed
past
the
ugly
dikes
and
muddy
leats
where
alef
s
slaves
were
streaming
the
gravel
for
tin
ore
through
rich
alluvial
pastures
spotted
with
red
cattle
and
up
to
alef
s
town
earthworks
and
stockades
surrounded
a
little
church
of
ancient
stone
and
a
cluster
of
granite
cabins
thatched
with
turf
in
which
the
slaves
abode
and
in
the
centre
of
all
a
vast
stone
barn
with
low
walls
and
high
sloping
roof
which
contained
alef
s
family
treasures
fighting
tail
horses
cattle
and
pigs
they
entered
at
one
end
between
the
pigsties
passed
on
through
the
then
through
the
stables
and
saw
before
them
dim
through
the
reek
of
thick
a
long
oaken
table
at
which
sat
huge
cornishmen
with
here
and
there
among
them
the
yellow
head
of
a
norseman
who
were
alef
s
following
or
fighting
men
boiled
meat
was
there
in
plenty
barley
cakes
and
ale
at
the
head
of
the
table
on
a
settle
was
alef
himself
a
jolly
giant
who
was
just
setting
to
work
to
drink
himself
stupid
with
mead
made
from
narcotic
heather
honey
by
his
side
sat
a
lovely
girl
with
great
gold
torcs
upon
her
throat
and
wrists
and
a
great
gold
brooch
fastening
a
shawl
which
had
plainly
come
from
the
looms
of
spain
or
of
the
east
and
next
to
her
again
feeding
her
with
titbits
cut
off
with
his
own
dagger
and
laid
on
barley
cake
instead
of
a
plate
sat
a
more
gigantic
personage
even
than
alef
the
biggest
man
that
hereward
had
ever
seen
with
high
cheek
bones
and
small
ferret
eyes
looking
out
from
a
greasy
mass
of
bright
red
hair
and
beard
no
questions
were
asked
of
the
they
set
themselves
down
in
silence
in
empty
places
and
according
to
the
laws
of
the
good
old
cornish
hospitality
were
allowed
to
eat
and
drink
their
fill
before
they
spoke
a
word
welcome
here
again
friend
said
alef
at
last
in
good
enough
danish
calling
the
eldest
merchant
by
name
do
you
bring
wine
the
merchant
nodded
and
you
want
tin
the
merchant
nodded
again
and
lifting
his
cup
drank
alef
s
health
following
it
up
by
a
coarse
joke
in
cornish
which
raised
a
laugh
all
round
the
norse
trader
of
those
days
it
must
be
remembered
was
none
of
the
cringing
and
effeminate
chapmen
who
figure
in
the
stories
of
the
middle
ages
a
free
norse
or
dane
himself
often
of
noble
blood
he
fought
as
willingly
as
he
bought
and
held
his
own
as
an
equal
whether
at
the
court
of
a
cornish
kinglet
or
at
that
of
the
great
kaiser
of
the
greeks
and
you
fair
sir
said
alef
looking
keenly
at
hereward
by
what
name
shall
i
call
you
and
what
service
can
i
do
for
you
you
look
more
like
an
earl
s
son
than
a
merchant
and
are
come
here
surely
for
other
things
besides
health
to
king
alef
said
hereward
raising
the
cup
who
i
am
i
will
tell
to
none
but
alef
s
self
but
an
earl
s
son
i
am
though
an
outlaw
and
a
rover
my
lands
are
the
breadth
of
my
my
plough
is
my
sword
my
treasure
is
my
good
right
hand
nothing
i
have
and
nothing
i
need
save
to
serve
noble
kings
and
earls
and
win
me
a
champion
s
fame
if
you
have
battles
to
fight
tell
me
that
i
may
fight
them
for
you
if
you
have
none
thank
god
for
his
peace
and
let
me
eat
and
drink
and
go
in
king
alef
needs
neither
man
nor
boy
to
fight
his
battle
as
long
as
ironhook
sits
in
his
it
was
the
giant
who
spoke
in
a
broken
tongue
part
scotch
part
cornish
part
danish
which
hereward
could
hardly
understand
but
that
the
ogre
intended
to
insult
him
he
understood
well
enough
hereward
had
hoped
to
find
giants
in
cornwall
and
behold
he
had
found
one
at
once
though
rather
to
judge
from
his
looks
a
pictish
than
a
cornish
giant
and
true
to
his
reckless
determination
to
defy
and
fight
every
man
and
beast
who
was
willing
to
defy
and
fight
him
he
turned
on
his
elbow
and
stared
at
ironhook
in
scorn
meditating
some
speech
which
might
provoke
the
quarrel
as
he
did
so
his
eye
happily
caught
that
of
the
fair
princess
she
was
watching
him
with
a
strange
look
admiring
warning
imploring
and
when
she
saw
that
he
noticed
her
she
laid
her
finger
on
her
lip
in
token
of
silence
crossed
herself
devoutly
and
then
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
again
as
if
beseeching
him
to
be
patient
and
silent
in
the
name
of
him
who
answered
not
again
hereward
as
is
well
seen
wanted
not
for
quick
wit
or
for
chivalrous
feeling
he
had
observed
the
rough
devotion
of
the
giant
to
the
lady
he
had
observed
too
that
she
shrank
from
it
that
she
turned
away
with
loathing
when
he
offered
her
his
own
cup
while
he
answered
by
a
dark
and
deadly
scowl
was
there
an
adventure
here
was
she
in
duress
either
from
this
ironhook
or
from
her
father
or
from
both
did
she
need
hereward
s
help
if
so
she
was
so
lovely
that
he
could
not
refuse
it
and
on
the
chance
he
swallowed
down
his
high
stomach
and
answered
blandly
enough
one
could
see
without
eyes
noble
sir
that
you
were
worth
any
ten
common
men
but
as
every
one
has
not
like
you
the
luck
of
so
lovely
a
lady
by
your
side
i
thought
that
perchance
you
might
hand
over
some
of
your
lesser
quarrels
to
one
like
me
who
has
not
yet
seen
so
much
good
fighting
as
yourself
and
enjoy
yourself
in
pleasant
company
at
home
as
i
should
surely
do
in
your
the
princess
shuddered
and
turned
pale
then
looked
at
hereward
and
smiled
her
thanks
ironhook
laughed
a
savage
laugh
hereward
s
jest
being
translated
into
cornish
for
the
benefit
of
the
company
was
highly
approved
by
all
and
good
humor
being
restored
every
man
got
drunk
save
hereward
who
found
the
mead
too
sweet
and
sickening
after
which
those
who
could
go
to
bed
went
to
bed
not
as
in
england
footnote
cornwall
was
not
then
considered
part
of
england
among
the
rushes
on
the
floor
but
in
the
bunks
or
berths
of
wattle
which
stood
two
or
three
tiers
high
along
the
wall
the
next
morning
as
hereward
went
out
to
wash
his
face
and
hands
in
the
brook
below
he
being
the
only
man
in
the
house
who
did
so
martin
lightfoot
followed
him
what
is
it
martin
hast
thou
had
too
much
of
that
sweet
mead
last
night
that
thou
must
come
out
to
cool
thy
head
too
i
came
out
for
two
reasons
first
to
see
fair
play
in
case
that
ironhook
should
come
to
wash
his
ugly
visage
and
find
you
on
all
fours
over
the
brook
you
understand
and
next
to
tell
you
what
i
heard
last
night
among
the
and
what
did
you
hear
fine
adventures
if
we
can
but
compass
them
you
saw
that
lady
with
the
fellow
i
saw
that
you
saw
well
if
you
will
believe
me
that
man
has
no
more
gentle
blood
than
i
have
has
no
more
right
to
sit
on
the
settle
than
i
he
is
a
s
son
a
pict
from
galloway
who
came
down
with
a
pirate
crew
and
has
made
himself
the
master
of
this
drunken
old
prince
and
the
darling
of
all
his
housecarles
and
now
will
needs
be
his
whether
he
will
or
i
thought
as
much
said
hereward
but
how
didst
thou
find
out
this
i
went
out
and
sat
with
the
knaves
and
the
maids
and
listened
to
their
and
harp
they
can
these
cornish
like
very
elves
and
then
i
too
sang
songs
and
told
them
stories
for
i
can
talk
their
tongue
somewhat
till
they
all
blest
me
for
a
right
good
fellow
and
then
i
fell
to
praising
up
old
ironhook
to
the
praising
him
up
man
ay
just
because
i
suspected
him
for
the
women
are
so
contrary
that
if
you
speak
evil
of
a
man
they
will
surely
speak
good
of
him
but
if
you
will
only
speak
good
of
him
then
you
will
hear
all
the
evil
of
him
he
ever
has
done
and
more
beside
and
this
i
heard
that
the
king
s
daughter
can
not
abide
him
and
would
as
lief
marry
a
one
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
said
hereward
as
long
as
one
has
eyes
in
one
s
head
i
will
kill
the
fellow
and
carry
her
off
ere
hours
be
softly
softly
my
young
master
you
need
to
be
told
something
that
your
eyes
would
not
tell
you
and
that
is
that
the
poor
lass
is
betrothed
already
to
a
son
of
old
king
ranald
the
ostman
of
waterford
son
of
old
king
sigtryg
who
ruled
there
when
i
was
a
he
is
a
kinsman
of
mine
then
said
hereward
all
the
more
reason
that
i
should
kill
this
if
you
can
said
martin
lightfoot
if
i
can
retorted
hereward
fiercely
well
well
wilful
heart
must
have
its
way
only
take
my
counsel
speak
to
the
poor
young
lady
first
and
see
what
she
will
tell
you
lest
you
only
make
bad
worse
and
bring
down
her
father
and
his
men
on
her
as
well
as
hereward
agreed
and
resolved
to
watch
his
opportunity
of
speaking
to
the
princess
as
they
went
in
to
the
morning
meal
they
met
alef
he
was
in
high
good
humor
with
hereward
and
all
the
more
so
when
hereward
told
him
his
name
and
how
he
was
the
son
of
leofric
i
will
warrant
you
are
he
said
by
the
gray
head
you
carry
on
green
shoulders
no
discreeter
man
they
say
in
these
isles
than
the
old
you
speak
truth
sir
said
hereward
though
he
be
no
father
of
mine
now
for
of
leofric
it
is
said
in
king
edward
s
court
that
if
a
man
ask
counsel
of
him
it
is
as
though
he
had
asked
it
of
the
oracles
of
then
you
are
his
true
son
young
man
i
saw
how
you
kept
the
peace
with
ironhook
and
i
owe
you
thanks
for
it
for
though
he
is
my
good
friend
and
will
be
my
erelong
yet
a
quarrel
with
him
is
more
than
i
can
abide
just
now
and
i
should
not
like
to
have
seen
my
guest
and
my
kinsman
slain
in
my
hereward
would
have
said
that
he
thought
there
was
no
fear
of
that
but
he
prudently
held
his
tongue
and
having
an
end
to
gain
listened
instead
of
talking
twenty
years
ago
of
course
i
could
have
thrashed
him
as
easily
as
but
now
i
am
getting
old
and
shaky
and
the
man
has
been
a
great
help
in
need
six
kings
of
these
parts
has
he
killed
for
me
who
drove
off
my
cattle
and
stopped
my
tin
works
and
plundered
my
monks
cells
too
which
is
worse
while
i
was
away
sailing
the
seas
and
he
is
a
right
good
fellow
at
heart
though
he
be
a
little
rough
so
be
friends
with
him
as
long
as
you
stay
here
and
if
i
can
do
you
a
service
i
they
went
in
to
their
morning
meal
at
which
hereward
resolved
to
keep
the
peace
which
he
longed
to
break
and
therefore
as
was
to
be
expected
broke
for
during
the
meal
the
fair
lady
with
no
worse
intention
perhaps
than
that
of
teasing
her
tyrant
fell
to
open
praises
of
hereward
s
fair
face
and
golden
hair
and
being
insulted
therefore
by
the
ironhook
retaliated
by
observations
about
his
personal
appearance
which
were
more
common
in
the
eleventh
century
than
they
happily
are
now
he
to
comfort
himself
drank
deep
of
the
french
wine
which
had
just
been
brought
and
broached
and
then
went
out
into
the
where
in
the
midst
of
his
admiring
he
enacted
a
scene
as
ludicrous
as
it
was
pitiable
all
the
childish
vanity
of
the
savage
boiled
over
he
strutted
he
shouted
he
tossed
about
his
huge
limbs
he
called
for
a
harper
and
challenged
all
around
to
dance
sing
leap
fight
do
anything
against
him
meeting
with
nothing
but
admiring
silence
he
danced
himself
out
of
breath
and
then
began
boasting
once
more
of
his
fights
his
cruelties
his
butcheries
his
impossible
escapes
and
victories
till
at
last
as
luck
would
have
it
he
espied
hereward
and
poured
out
a
stream
of
abuse
against
englishmen
and
english
courage
englishmen
he
said
were
naught
had
he
not
slain
three
of
them
himself
with
one
blow
of
your
mouth
i
suppose
quoth
hereward
who
saw
that
the
quarrel
must
come
and
was
glad
to
have
it
done
and
over
of
my
mouth
roared
ironhook
of
my
sword
man
of
your
mouth
said
hereward
of
your
brain
were
they
begotten
of
the
breath
of
your
mouth
they
were
born
and
by
the
breath
of
your
mouth
you
can
slay
them
again
as
often
as
you
the
joke
as
it
has
been
handed
down
to
us
by
the
old
chroniclers
seems
clumsy
enough
but
it
sent
the
princess
say
they
into
shrieks
of
laughter
were
it
not
that
my
lord
alef
was
here
shouted
ironhook
i
would
kill
you
out
of
promise
to
fight
fair
and
do
your
worst
the
more
fairly
you
fight
the
more
honor
you
will
win
said
hereward
whereupon
the
two
were
parted
for
the
while
two
hours
afterwards
hereward
completely
armed
with
helmet
and
mail
shirt
sword
and
javelin
hurried
across
the
great
with
martin
lightfoot
at
his
heels
towards
the
little
church
upon
the
knoll
above
the
two
wild
men
entered
into
the
cool
darkness
and
saw
before
them
by
the
light
of
a
tiny
lamp
the
crucifix
over
the
altar
and
beneath
it
that
which
was
then
believed
to
be
the
body
of
him
who
made
heaven
and
earth
they
stopped
trembling
for
a
moment
bowed
themselves
before
that
to
them
perpetual
miracle
and
then
hurried
on
to
a
low
doorway
to
the
right
inside
which
dwelt
alef
s
chaplain
one
of
those
good
celtic
priests
who
were
supposed
to
represent
a
christianity
more
ancient
than
and
all
but
independent
of
the
then
church
of
rome
the
cell
was
such
a
one
as
a
convict
would
now
disdain
to
inhabit
a
low
roof
the
slates
and
rafters
unceiled
the
stone
walls
and
floor
unplastered
by
a
window
unglazed
and
closed
with
a
shutter
at
night
a
truss
of
straw
and
a
rug
the
priest
s
bed
lay
in
a
corner
the
only
other
furniture
was
a
large
oak
chest
containing
the
holy
vessels
and
vestments
and
a
few
old
books
it
stood
directly
under
the
window
for
the
sake
of
light
for
it
served
the
good
priest
for
both
table
and
chair
and
on
it
he
was
sitting
reading
in
his
book
at
that
minute
the
sunshine
and
the
wind
streaming
in
behind
his
head
doing
no
good
to
his
rheumatism
of
thirty
years
standing
is
there
a
priest
here
asked
hereward
hurriedly
the
old
man
looked
up
shook
his
head
and
answered
in
cornish
speak
to
him
in
latin
martin
maybe
he
will
understand
martin
spoke
my
lord
here
wants
a
priest
to
shrive
him
and
that
quickly
he
is
going
to
fight
the
great
tyrant
ironhook
as
you
call
ironhook
answered
the
priest
in
good
latin
enough
and
he
so
young
god
help
him
he
is
a
dead
man
what
is
this
a
fresh
soul
sent
to
its
account
by
the
hands
of
that
man
of
belial
can
not
he
entreat
him
can
he
not
make
peace
and
save
his
young
life
he
is
but
a
stripling
and
that
man
like
goliath
of
old
a
man
of
war
from
his
youth
and
my
master
said
martin
lightfoot
proudly
is
like
young
david
one
that
can
face
a
giant
and
kill
him
for
he
has
slain
like
david
his
lion
and
his
bear
ere
now
at
least
he
is
one
that
will
neither
make
peace
nor
entreat
the
face
of
living
man
so
shrive
him
quickly
master
priest
and
let
him
be
gone
to
his
poor
martin
lightfoot
spoke
thus
bravely
only
to
keep
up
his
spirits
and
his
young
lord
s
for
in
spite
of
his
confidence
in
hereward
s
prowess
he
had
given
him
up
for
a
lost
man
and
the
tears
ran
down
his
rugged
cheeks
as
the
old
priest
rising
up
and
seizing
hereward
s
two
hands
in
his
besought
him
with
the
passionate
and
graceful
eloquence
of
his
race
to
have
mercy
upon
his
own
youth
hereward
understood
his
meaning
though
not
his
words
tell
him
he
said
to
martin
that
fight
i
must
and
tell
him
that
shrive
me
he
must
and
that
quickly
tell
him
how
the
fellow
met
me
in
the
wood
below
just
now
and
would
have
slain
me
there
unarmed
as
i
was
and
how
when
i
told
him
it
was
a
shame
to
strike
a
naked
man
he
told
me
he
would
give
me
but
one
hour
s
grace
to
go
back
on
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
for
my
armor
and
weapons
and
meet
him
there
again
to
die
by
his
hand
so
shrive
me
quick
sir
hereward
knelt
down
martin
lightfoot
knelt
down
by
him
and
with
a
trembling
voice
began
to
interpret
for
him
what
does
he
say
asked
hereward
as
the
priest
murmured
something
to
himself
he
said
quoth
martin
now
fairly
blubbering
that
fair
and
young
as
you
are
your
shrift
should
be
as
short
and
as
clean
as
david
hereward
was
touched
anything
but
that
said
he
smiting
on
his
breast
mea
culpa
mea
culpa
mea
maxima
tell
him
how
i
robbed
my
the
priest
groaned
as
martin
did
so
and
how
i
mocked
at
my
mother
and
left
her
in
a
rage
without
ever
a
kind
word
between
us
and
how
i
have
slain
i
know
not
how
many
men
in
battle
though
that
i
trust
need
not
lay
heavily
on
my
soul
seeing
that
i
killed
them
all
in
fair
again
the
priest
groaned
and
how
i
robbed
a
certain
priest
of
his
money
and
gave
it
away
to
my
here
the
priest
groaned
more
bitterly
still
o
my
son
my
son
where
hast
thou
found
time
to
lay
all
these
burdens
on
thy
young
soul
it
will
take
less
time
said
martin
bluntly
for
you
to
take
the
burdens
off
but
i
dare
not
absolve
him
for
robbing
a
priest
heaven
help
him
he
must
go
to
the
bishop
for
that
he
is
more
fit
to
go
on
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
than
to
he
has
no
time
quoth
martin
for
bishops
or
tell
him
says
hereward
that
in
this
purse
is
all
i
have
that
in
it
he
will
find
sixty
silver
pennies
beside
two
strange
coins
of
sir
priest
said
martin
lightfoot
taking
the
purse
from
hereward
and
keeping
it
in
his
own
hand
there
are
in
this
bag
martin
had
no
mind
to
let
the
priest
into
the
secret
of
the
state
of
their
finances
and
tell
him
continued
hereward
that
if
i
fall
in
this
battle
i
give
him
all
that
money
that
he
may
part
it
among
the
poor
for
the
good
of
my
pish
said
martin
to
his
lord
that
is
paying
him
for
having
you
killed
you
should
pay
him
for
keeping
you
and
without
waiting
for
the
answer
he
spoke
in
latin
and
if
he
comes
back
safe
from
this
battle
he
will
give
you
ten
pennies
for
yourself
and
your
church
priest
and
therefore
expects
you
to
pray
your
very
loudest
while
he
is
i
will
pray
i
will
pray
said
the
holy
man
i
will
wrestle
in
prayer
ah
that
he
could
slay
the
wicked
and
reward
the
proud
according
to
his
deservings
ah
that
he
could
rid
me
and
my
master
and
my
young
lady
of
this
son
of
belial
this
devourer
of
widows
and
orphans
this
slayer
of
the
poor
and
needy
who
fills
this
place
with
innocent
blood
him
of
whom
it
is
written
they
stretch
forth
their
mouth
unto
the
heaven
and
their
tongue
goeth
through
the
world
therefore
fall
the
people
unto
them
and
thereout
suck
they
no
small
i
will
shrive
him
shrive
him
of
all
save
robbing
the
priest
and
for
that
he
must
go
to
the
bishop
if
he
live
and
if
not
the
lord
have
mercy
on
his
and
so
weeping
and
trembling
the
good
old
man
pronounced
the
words
of
absolution
hereward
rose
thanked
him
and
then
hurried
out
in
silence
you
will
pray
your
very
loudest
priest
said
martin
as
he
followed
his
young
lord
i
will
i
will
quoth
he
and
kneeling
down
began
to
chant
that
noble
psalm
quam
bonus
israel
which
he
had
just
so
fitly
quoted
thou
gavest
him
the
bag
martin
said
hereward
as
they
hurried
on
you
are
not
dead
yet
no
pay
no
play
is
as
good
a
rule
for
priest
as
for
now
then
martin
lightfoot
come
not
with
me
it
must
never
be
said
even
slanderously
that
i
brought
two
into
the
field
against
one
and
if
i
die
martin
you
won
t
die
said
lightfoot
shutting
his
teeth
if
i
die
go
back
to
my
people
somehow
and
tell
them
that
i
died
like
a
true
earl
s
hereward
held
out
his
hand
martin
fell
on
his
knees
and
kissed
it
watched
him
with
set
teeth
till
he
disappeared
in
the
wood
and
then
started
forward
and
entered
the
bushes
at
a
different
spot
i
must
be
nigh
at
hand
to
see
fair
play
he
muttered
to
himself
in
case
any
of
his
ruffians
be
hanging
about
fair
play
i
ll
see
and
fair
play
i
ll
give
too
for
the
sake
of
my
lord
s
honor
though
i
be
bitterly
loath
to
do
it
so
many
times
as
i
have
been
a
villain
when
it
was
of
no
use
why
mayn
t
i
be
one
now
when
it
would
serve
the
purpose
indeed
why
did
we
ever
come
into
this
accursed
place
but
one
thing
i
will
do
said
he
as
he
ensconced
himself
under
a
thick
holly
whence
he
could
see
the
meeting
of
the
combatants
upon
an
open
lawn
some
twenty
yards
away
if
that
big
kills
my
master
and
i
do
not
jump
on
his
back
and
pick
his
brains
out
with
this
trusty
steel
of
mine
may
my
right
arm
and
martin
lightfoot
swore
a
fearful
oath
which
need
not
here
be
written
the
priest
had
just
finished
his
chant
of
the
psalm
and
had
betaken
himself
in
his
spiritual
warfare
as
it
was
then
called
to
the
equally
apposite
quid
gloriaris
why
boastest
thou
thyself
thou
tyrant
that
thou
canst
do
mischief
whereas
the
goodness
of
god
endureth
yet
daily
father
father
cried
a
soft
voice
in
the
doorway
where
are
you
and
in
hurried
the
princess
hide
this
she
said
breathless
drawing
from
beneath
her
mantle
a
huge
sword
hide
it
where
no
one
dare
touch
it
under
the
altar
behind
the
holy
rood
no
place
too
what
is
it
asked
the
priest
springing
up
from
his
knees
his
sword
the
ogre
s
his
magic
sword
which
kills
whomsoever
it
strikes
i
coaxed
the
wretch
to
let
me
have
it
last
night
when
he
was
tipsy
for
fear
he
should
quarrel
with
the
young
stranger
and
i
have
kept
it
from
him
ever
since
by
one
excuse
or
another
and
now
he
has
sent
one
of
his
ruffians
in
for
it
saying
that
if
i
do
not
give
it
up
at
once
he
will
come
back
and
kill
he
dare
not
do
that
said
the
priest
what
is
there
that
he
dare
not
said
she
hide
it
at
once
i
know
that
he
wants
it
to
fight
with
this
if
he
wants
it
for
that
said
the
priest
it
is
too
late
for
half
an
hour
is
past
since
hereward
went
to
meet
and
you
let
him
go
you
did
not
persuade
him
stop
him
you
let
him
go
hence
to
his
death
in
vain
the
good
man
expostulated
and
explained
that
it
was
no
fault
of
his
you
must
come
with
me
this
instant
to
my
father
to
them
they
must
be
parted
they
shall
be
parted
if
you
dare
not
i
dare
i
will
throw
myself
between
them
and
he
that
strikes
the
other
shall
strike
and
she
hurried
the
priest
out
of
the
house
down
the
knoll
and
across
the
yard
there
they
found
others
on
the
same
errand
the
news
that
a
battle
was
toward
had
soon
spread
and
the
were
hurrying
down
to
the
fight
kept
back
however
by
alef
who
strode
along
at
their
head
alef
was
sorely
perplexed
in
mind
he
had
taken
as
all
honest
men
did
a
great
liking
to
hereward
moreover
he
was
his
kinsman
and
his
guest
save
him
he
would
if
he
could
but
how
to
save
him
without
mortally
offending
his
tyrant
ironhook
he
could
not
see
at
least
he
would
exert
what
little
power
he
had
and
prevent
if
possible
his
from
helping
their
darling
leader
against
the
hapless
lad
alef
s
perplexity
was
much
increased
when
his
daughter
bounded
towards
him
seizing
him
by
the
arm
and
hurried
him
on
showing
by
look
and
word
which
of
the
combatants
she
favored
so
plainly
that
the
ruffians
behind
broke
into
scornful
murmurs
they
burst
through
the
bushes
martin
lightfoot
happily
heard
them
coming
and
had
just
time
to
slip
away
noiselessly
like
a
rabbit
to
the
other
part
of
the
cover
the
combat
seemed
at
the
first
glance
to
be
one
between
a
grown
man
and
a
child
so
unequal
was
the
size
of
the
combatants
but
the
second
look
showed
that
the
advantage
was
by
no
means
with
ironhook
stumbling
to
and
fro
with
the
broken
shaft
of
a
javelin
sticking
in
his
thigh
he
vainly
tried
to
seize
and
crush
hereward
in
his
enormous
arms
hereward
bleeding
but
still
active
and
upright
broke
away
and
sprang
round
him
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
strike
a
deadly
blow
the
housecarles
rushed
forward
with
yells
alef
shouted
to
the
combatants
to
desist
but
ere
the
party
could
reach
them
hereward
s
opportunity
had
come
ironhook
after
a
fruitless
lunge
stumbled
forward
hereward
leapt
aside
and
spying
an
unguarded
spot
below
the
corslet
drove
his
sword
deep
into
the
giant
s
body
and
rolled
him
over
upon
the
sward
then
arose
shouts
of
fury
foul
play
cried
one
and
others
taking
up
the
cry
called
out
sorcery
and
treason
hereward
stood
over
ironhook
as
he
lay
writhing
and
foaming
on
the
ground
killed
by
a
boy
at
last
groaned
he
if
i
had
but
had
my
own
sword
my
which
that
witch
stole
from
me
but
last
night
and
amid
foul
curses
and
bitter
tears
of
shame
his
mortal
spirit
fled
to
its
doom
the
housecarles
rushed
in
on
hereward
who
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
them
at
arm
s
length
by
long
sweeps
of
his
sword
alef
entreated
threatened
promised
a
fair
trial
if
the
men
would
give
fair
play
when
to
complete
the
confusion
the
princess
threw
herself
upon
the
corpse
shrieking
and
tearing
her
hair
and
to
hereward
s
surprise
and
disgust
bewailed
the
prowess
and
the
virtues
of
the
dead
calling
upon
all
present
to
avenge
his
murder
hereward
vowed
inwardly
that
he
would
never
again
trust
woman
s
fancy
or
fight
in
woman
s
quarrel
he
was
now
nigh
at
his
wits
end
the
housecarles
had
closed
round
him
in
a
ring
with
the
intention
of
seizing
him
and
however
well
he
might
defend
his
front
he
might
be
crippled
at
any
moment
from
behind
but
in
the
very
nick
of
time
martin
lightfoot
burst
through
the
crowd
set
himself
heel
to
heel
with
his
master
and
broke
out
not
with
threats
but
with
a
laugh
here
is
a
pretty
coil
about
a
brute
of
a
pict
danes
ostmen
he
cried
are
you
not
ashamed
to
call
such
a
fellow
your
lord
when
you
have
such
a
true
earl
s
son
as
this
to
lead
you
if
you
will
the
ostmen
in
the
company
looked
at
each
other
martin
lightfoot
saw
that
his
appeal
to
the
antipathies
of
race
had
told
and
followed
it
up
by
a
string
of
witticisms
upon
the
pictish
nation
in
general
of
which
the
only
two
fit
for
modern
ears
to
be
set
down
were
the
two
old
stories
that
the
picts
had
feet
so
large
that
they
used
to
lie
upon
their
backs
and
hold
up
their
legs
to
shelter
them
from
the
sun
and
that
when
killed
they
could
not
fall
down
but
died
as
they
were
all
standing
so
that
the
only
foul
play
i
can
see
is
that
my
master
shoved
the
fellow
over
after
he
had
stabbed
him
instead
of
leaving
him
to
stand
upright
there
like
one
of
your
cornish
dolmens
till
his
flesh
should
fall
off
his
hereward
saw
the
effect
of
martin
s
words
and
burst
out
in
danish
likewise
look
at
me
he
said
i
am
hereward
the
outlaw
i
am
the
champion
i
am
the
berserker
i
am
the
viking
i
am
the
land
thief
the
sea
thief
the
ravager
of
the
world
the
the
the
the
darling
of
the
wolf
the
curse
of
the
widow
touch
me
and
i
will
give
you
to
the
raven
and
to
the
wolf
as
i
have
this
ogre
be
my
men
and
follow
me
over
the
swan
s
road
over
the
whale
s
bath
over
the
s
leap
to
the
land
where
the
sea
meets
the
sun
and
golden
apples
hang
on
every
tree
and
we
will
freight
our
ships
with
moorish
maidens
and
the
gold
of
cadiz
and
hark
to
the
viking
hark
to
the
right
earl
s
son
shouted
some
of
the
danes
whose
blood
had
been
stirred
many
a
time
before
by
such
wild
words
and
on
whom
hereward
s
youth
and
beauty
had
their
due
effect
and
now
the
counsels
of
the
ruffians
being
divided
the
old
priest
gained
courage
to
step
in
let
them
deliver
hereward
and
his
serving
man
into
his
custody
he
would
bring
them
forth
on
the
morrow
and
there
should
be
full
investigation
and
fair
trial
and
so
hereward
and
martin
who
both
refused
stoutly
to
give
up
their
arms
were
marched
back
into
the
town
locked
in
the
little
church
and
left
to
their
meditations
hereward
sat
down
on
the
pavement
and
cursed
the
princess
martin
lightfoot
took
off
his
master
s
corslet
and
as
well
as
the
darkness
would
allow
bound
up
his
wounds
which
happily
were
not
severe
were
i
you
said
he
at
last
i
should
keep
my
curses
till
i
saw
the
end
of
this
has
not
the
girl
betrayed
me
shamefully
not
she
i
saw
her
warn
you
as
far
as
looks
could
do
not
to
quarrel
with
the
that
was
because
she
did
not
know
me
little
she
thought
that
i
could
don
t
hollo
till
you
are
out
of
the
wood
this
is
a
night
for
praying
rather
than
she
can
not
really
love
that
wretch
said
hereward
after
a
pause
you
saw
how
she
mocked
women
are
strange
things
and
often
tease
most
where
they
love
but
such
a
misbegotten
women
are
strange
things
say
i
and
with
some
a
big
fellow
is
a
pretty
fellow
be
he
uglier
than
seven
ironhooks
still
just
because
women
are
strange
things
have
patience
say
the
lock
creaked
and
the
old
priest
came
in
martin
leapt
to
the
open
door
but
it
was
slammed
in
his
face
by
men
outside
with
scornful
laughter
the
priest
took
hereward
s
head
in
his
hands
wept
over
him
blessed
him
for
having
slain
goliath
like
young
david
and
then
set
food
and
drink
before
the
two
but
he
answered
martin
s
questions
only
with
sighs
and
shakings
of
the
head
let
us
eat
and
drink
then
said
martin
and
after
that
you
my
lord
sleep
off
your
wounds
while
i
watch
the
door
i
have
no
fancy
for
these
fellows
taking
us
unawares
at
martin
lay
quietly
across
the
door
till
the
small
hours
listening
to
every
sound
till
the
key
creaked
once
more
in
the
lock
he
started
at
the
sound
and
seizing
the
person
who
entered
round
the
neck
whispered
one
word
and
you
are
do
not
hurt
me
half
shrieked
a
stifled
voice
and
martin
lightfoot
to
his
surprise
found
that
he
had
grasped
no
armed
man
but
the
slight
frame
of
a
young
girl
i
am
the
princess
she
whispered
let
me
a
very
pretty
hostage
for
us
thought
martin
and
letting
her
go
seized
the
key
locking
the
door
in
the
inside
take
me
to
your
master
she
cried
and
martin
led
her
up
the
church
wondering
but
half
suspecting
some
further
trap
you
have
a
dagger
in
your
hand
said
he
holding
her
wrist
i
have
if
i
had
meant
to
use
it
it
would
have
been
used
first
on
you
take
it
if
you
she
hurried
up
to
hereward
who
lay
sleeping
quietly
on
the
knelt
by
him
wrung
his
hands
called
him
her
champion
her
deliverer
i
am
not
well
awake
yet
said
he
coldly
and
don
t
know
whether
this
may
not
be
a
dream
as
more
that
i
have
seen
and
heard
seems
to
it
is
no
dream
i
am
true
i
was
always
true
to
you
have
i
not
put
myself
in
your
power
am
i
not
come
here
to
deliver
you
my
deliverer
the
tears
which
you
shed
over
your
ogre
s
corpse
seem
to
have
dried
quickly
cruel
what
else
could
i
do
you
heard
him
accuse
me
to
those
ruffians
of
having
stolen
his
sword
my
life
my
father
s
life
were
not
safe
a
moment
had
i
not
dissembled
and
done
the
thing
i
loathed
ah
she
went
on
bitterly
you
men
who
rule
the
world
and
us
by
cruel
steel
you
forget
that
we
poor
women
have
but
one
weapon
left
wherewith
to
hold
our
own
and
that
is
cunning
and
are
driven
by
you
day
after
day
to
tell
the
lie
which
we
then
you
really
stole
his
sword
and
hid
it
here
for
your
sake
and
she
drew
the
weapon
from
behind
the
altar
take
it
it
is
yours
now
it
is
magical
whoever
smites
with
it
need
never
smite
again
now
quick
you
must
be
gone
but
promise
one
thing
before
you
if
i
leave
this
land
safe
i
will
do
it
be
it
what
it
may
why
not
come
with
me
lady
and
see
it
done
she
laughed
vain
boy
do
you
think
that
i
love
you
well
enough
for
that
i
have
won
you
and
why
should
i
not
keep
you
said
hereward
sullenly
do
you
not
know
that
i
am
betrothed
to
your
kinsman
and
though
that
you
can
not
know
that
i
love
your
kinsman
so
i
have
all
the
blows
and
none
of
the
tush
you
have
the
glory
the
sword
and
the
chance
if
you
will
do
my
bidding
of
being
called
by
all
ladies
a
true
and
gentle
knight
who
cared
not
for
his
own
pleasure
but
for
deeds
of
chivalry
go
to
my
betrothed
to
waterford
over
the
sea
take
him
this
ring
and
tell
him
by
that
token
to
come
and
claim
me
soon
lest
he
run
the
danger
of
losing
me
a
second
time
and
lose
me
then
forever
for
i
am
in
hard
case
here
and
were
it
not
for
my
father
s
sake
perhaps
i
might
be
weak
enough
in
spite
of
what
men
might
say
to
flee
with
you
to
your
kinsman
across
the
trust
me
and
come
said
hereward
whose
young
blood
kindled
with
a
sudden
nobleness
trust
me
and
i
will
treat
you
like
my
sister
like
my
queen
by
the
holy
rood
above
i
will
swear
to
be
true
to
i
do
trust
you
but
it
can
not
be
here
is
money
for
you
in
plenty
to
hire
a
passage
if
you
need
it
is
no
shame
to
take
it
from
me
and
now
one
thing
more
here
is
a
cord
you
must
bind
the
hands
and
feet
of
the
old
priest
inside
and
then
you
must
bind
mine
never
quoth
hereward
it
must
be
how
else
can
i
explain
your
having
got
the
key
i
made
them
give
me
the
key
on
the
pretence
that
with
one
who
had
most
cause
to
hate
you
it
would
be
safe
and
when
they
come
and
find
us
in
the
morning
i
shall
tell
them
how
i
came
here
to
stab
you
with
my
own
hands
you
must
lay
the
dagger
by
me
and
how
you
and
your
man
fell
upon
us
and
bound
us
and
you
escaped
ah
mary
mother
continued
the
maiden
with
a
sigh
when
shall
we
poor
weak
women
have
no
more
need
of
lying
she
lay
down
and
hereward
in
spite
of
himself
gently
bound
her
hands
and
feet
kissing
them
as
he
bound
them
i
shall
do
well
here
upon
the
altar
steps
said
she
how
can
i
spend
my
time
better
till
the
morning
light
than
to
lie
here
and
pray
the
old
priest
who
was
plainly
in
the
plot
submitted
meekly
to
the
same
fate
and
hereward
and
martin
lightfoot
stole
out
locking
the
door
but
leaving
the
key
in
it
outside
to
scramble
over
the
old
earthwork
was
an
easy
matter
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
hurrying
down
the
valley
to
the
sea
with
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
behind
them
from
the
north
did
i
not
tell
you
my
lord
said
martin
lightfoot
to
keep
your
curses
till
you
had
seen
the
end
of
this
adventure
hereward
was
silent
his
brain
was
still
whirling
from
the
adventures
of
the
day
and
his
heart
was
very
deeply
touched
his
shrift
of
the
morning
hurried
and
formal
as
it
had
been
had
softened
him
his
danger
for
he
felt
how
he
had
been
face
to
face
with
death
had
softened
him
likewise
and
he
repented
somewhat
of
his
vainglorious
and
bloodthirsty
boasting
over
a
fallen
foe
as
he
began
to
see
that
there
was
a
purpose
more
noble
in
life
than
ranging
land
and
sea
a
ruffian
among
ruffians
seeking
for
glory
amid
blood
and
flame
the
idea
of
chivalry
of
succoring
the
weak
and
the
opprest
of
keeping
faith
and
honor
not
merely
towards
men
who
could
avenge
themselves
but
towards
women
who
could
not
the
dim
dawn
of
purity
gentleness
and
the
conquest
of
his
own
fierce
passions
all
these
had
taken
root
in
his
heart
during
his
adventure
with
the
fair
cornish
girl
the
seed
was
sown
would
it
he
cut
down
again
by
the
bitter
blasts
of
the
rough
fighting
world
or
would
it
grow
and
bear
the
noble
fruit
of
gentle
very
perfect
knighthood
they
reached
the
ship
clambered
on
hoard
without
ceremony
at
the
risk
of
being
taken
and
killed
as
robbers
and
told
their
case
the
merchants
had
not
completed
their
cargo
of
tin
hereward
offered
to
make
up
their
loss
to
them
if
they
would
set
sail
at
once
and
they
feeling
that
the
place
would
be
for
some
time
to
come
too
hot
to
hold
them
and
being
also
in
high
delight
like
honest
ostmen
with
hereward
s
prowess
agreed
to
sail
straight
for
waterford
and
complete
their
cargo
there
but
the
tide
was
out
it
was
three
full
hours
before
the
ship
could
float
and
for
three
full
hours
they
waited
in
fear
and
trembling
expecting
the
cornishmen
to
be
down
upon
them
in
a
body
every
moment
under
which
wholesome
fear
some
on
board
prayed
fervently
who
had
never
been
known
to
pray
before
chapter
iv
how
hereward
took
service
with
ranald
king
of
waterford
the
coasts
of
ireland
were
in
a
state
of
comparative
peace
in
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
the
ships
of
loghlin
seen
far
out
at
sea
no
longer
drove
the
population
shrieking
inland
heathen
danes
whether
fiongall
from
norway
or
dubgall
from
denmark
proper
no
longer
burned
convents
tortured
monks
for
their
gold
or
as
at
clonmacnoise
set
a
heathen
princess
oda
wife
of
thorgill
son
of
harold
harfager
aloft
on
the
high
altar
to
receive
the
homage
of
the
conquered
the
scandinavian
invaders
had
become
christianized
and
civilized
also
owing
to
their
continual
intercourse
with
foreign
nations
more
highly
than
the
irish
whom
they
had
overcome
that
was
easy
for
early
irish
civilization
seems
to
have
existed
only
in
the
convents
and
for
the
religious
and
when
they
were
crushed
mere
barbarism
was
left
behind
and
now
the
same
process
went
on
in
the
east
of
ireland
which
went
on
a
generation
or
two
later
in
the
east
of
scotland
the
danes
began
to
settle
down
into
peaceful
colonists
and
traders
ireland
was
poor
and
the
convents
plundered
once
could
not
be
plundered
again
the
irish
were
desperately
brave
and
almost
naked
they
were
as
perfect
in
the
arts
of
forest
warfare
as
those
modern
maories
whom
they
so
much
resembled
and
though
their
black
skenes
and
light
darts
were
no
match
for
the
danish
swords
and
which
they
adopted
during
the
middle
age
or
their
plaid
trousers
and
felt
capes
for
the
danish
helmet
and
chain
corslet
still
an
irishman
was
so
ugly
a
foe
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
fight
with
him
unless
he
could
be
robbed
afterwards
the
danes
who
like
their
descendants
of
northumbria
the
lowlands
and
ulster
were
canny
folk
with
a
shrewd
eye
to
interest
found
somewhat
to
their
regret
that
there
were
trades
even
more
profitable
than
robbery
and
murder
they
therefore
concentrated
themselves
round
harbors
and
river
mouths
and
sent
forth
their
ships
to
all
the
western
seas
from
dublin
waterford
wexford
cork
or
limerick
every
important
seaport
in
ireland
owes
its
existence
to
those
sturdy
vikings
sons
in
each
of
these
towns
they
had
founded
a
petty
kingdom
which
endured
until
and
even
in
some
cases
after
the
conquest
of
ireland
by
henry
ii
and
strongbow
they
intermarried
in
the
mean
while
with
the
native
irish
brian
boru
for
instance
was
so
connected
with
danish
royalty
that
it
is
still
a
question
whether
he
himself
had
not
danish
blood
in
his
veins
king
sigtryg
silkbeard
who
fought
against
him
at
clontarf
was
actually
his
and
so
too
according
to
another
irish
chronicler
was
king
olaff
kvaran
who
even
at
the
time
of
the
battle
of
clontarf
was
married
to
brian
boru
s
daughter
a
marriage
which
if
a
fact
was
startlingly
within
the
prohibited
degrees
of
consanguinity
but
the
ancient
irish
were
sadly
careless
on
such
points
and
as
giraldus
cambrensis
says
followed
the
example
of
men
of
old
in
their
vices
more
willingly
than
in
their
more
than
forty
years
had
elapsed
since
that
famous
battle
of
clontarf
and
since
ragnvald
reginald
or
ranald
son
of
sigtryg
the
norseman
had
been
slain
therein
by
brian
boru
on
that
one
day
so
the
irish
sang
the
northern
invaders
were
exterminated
once
and
for
all
by
the
milesian
hero
who
had
craftily
used
the
strangers
to
fight
his
battles
and
then
the
moment
they
became
formidable
to
himself
crushed
them
till
from
howth
to
brandon
in
kerry
there
was
not
a
without
a
danish
slave
threshing
thereon
or
a
quern
without
a
danish
woman
grinding
nevertheless
in
spite
of
the
total
annihilation
of
the
danish
power
in
the
emerald
isle
ranald
seemed
to
the
eyes
of
men
to
be
still
a
hale
old
warrior
ruling
constitutionally
that
is
with
a
wholesome
fear
of
being
outlawed
or
murdered
if
he
misbehaved
over
the
danes
in
waterford
with
five
hundred
warriors
at
his
back
axe
on
shoulder
and
sword
on
thigh
his
ships
drove
a
thriving
trade
with
france
and
spain
in
irish
fish
butter
honey
and
furs
his
workmen
coined
money
in
the
old
round
tower
of
dundory
built
by
his
predecessor
and
namesake
about
the
year
which
stands
as
reginald
s
tower
to
this
day
he
had
fought
many
a
bloody
battle
since
his
death
at
clontarf
by
the
side
of
his
old
leader
sigtryg
silkbeard
he
had
been
many
a
time
to
dublin
to
visit
his
even
more
prosperous
and
formidable
friend
and
was
so
delighted
with
the
new
church
of
the
holy
trinity
which
sigtryg
and
his
bishop
donatus
had
just
built
not
in
the
danish
or
ostman
town
but
in
the
heart
of
ancient
celtic
dublin
plain
proof
of
the
utter
overthrow
of
the
danish
power
that
he
had
determined
to
build
a
like
church
in
honor
of
the
holy
trinity
in
waterford
itself
a
thriving
valiant
old
king
he
seemed
as
he
sat
in
his
great
house
of
pine
logs
under
reginald
s
tower
upon
the
quay
drinking
french
and
spanish
wines
out
of
horns
of
ivory
and
cups
of
gold
and
over
his
head
hanging
upon
the
wall
the
huge
axe
with
which
so
his
flatterers
had
whispered
brian
boru
had
not
slain
him
but
he
brian
boru
nevertheless
then
as
since
alas
the
pleasant
theory
was
preferred
by
the
milesian
historians
to
the
plain
truth
and
far
away
inland
monks
wrote
and
harpers
sung
of
the
death
of
ranald
the
fiongall
and
all
his
mailed
one
teague
macmurrough
indeed
a
famous
bard
of
those
parts
composed
unto
his
harp
a
song
of
clontarf
the
fame
whereof
reached
ranald
s
ears
and
so
amused
him
that
he
rested
not
day
or
night
till
he
had
caught
the
hapless
bard
and
brought
him
in
triumph
into
waterford
there
he
compelled
him
at
sword
s
point
to
sing
to
him
and
his
housecarles
the
milesian
version
of
the
great
historical
event
and
when
the
harper
in
fear
and
trembling
came
to
the
story
of
ranald
s
own
death
at
brian
boru
s
hands
then
the
jolly
old
viking
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
and
instead
of
cutting
off
teague
s
head
gave
him
a
cup
of
goodly
wine
made
him
his
own
harper
thenceforth
and
bade
him
send
for
his
wife
and
children
and
sing
to
him
every
day
especially
the
song
of
clontarf
and
his
own
death
treating
him
very
much
in
fact
as
english
royalty
during
the
last
generation
treated
another
irish
bard
whose
song
was
even
more
sweet
and
his
notions
of
irish
history
even
more
grotesque
than
those
of
teague
macmurrough
it
was
to
this
old
king
or
rather
to
his
son
sigtryg
godson
of
sigtryg
silkbeard
and
distant
cousin
of
his
own
that
hereward
now
took
his
way
and
told
his
story
as
the
king
sat
in
his
hall
drinking
across
the
fire
after
the
old
norse
fashion
the
fire
of
pine
logs
was
in
the
midst
of
the
hall
and
the
smoke
went
out
through
a
louver
in
the
roof
on
one
side
was
a
long
bench
and
in
the
middle
of
it
the
king
s
high
right
and
left
of
him
sat
his
kinsmen
and
the
ladies
and
his
and
men
of
wealth
opposite
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
was
another
bench
in
the
middle
of
that
sat
his
marshal
and
right
and
left
all
his
housecarles
there
were
other
benches
behind
on
which
sat
more
freemen
but
of
lesser
rank
and
they
were
all
drinking
ale
which
a
servant
poured
out
of
a
bucket
into
a
great
bull
s
horn
and
the
men
handed
round
to
each
other
then
hereward
came
in
and
sat
down
on
the
end
of
the
hindermost
bench
and
martin
stood
behind
him
till
one
of
the
ladies
said
who
is
that
young
stranger
who
sits
behind
there
so
humbly
though
he
looks
like
an
earl
s
son
more
fit
to
sit
here
with
us
on
the
high
bench
so
he
does
quoth
king
ranald
come
forward
hither
young
sir
and
and
when
hereward
came
forward
all
the
ladies
agreed
that
he
must
be
an
earl
s
son
for
he
had
a
great
gold
torc
round
his
neck
and
gold
rings
on
his
wrists
and
a
new
scarlet
coat
bound
with
gold
braid
and
scarlet
stockings
with
gold
braid
up
to
the
knee
and
shoes
trimmed
with
martin
s
fur
and
a
short
blue
silk
cloak
over
all
trimmed
with
martin
s
fur
likewise
and
by
his
side
in
a
broad
belt
with
gold
studs
was
the
ogre
s
sword
with
its
ivory
hilt
and
velvet
sheath
and
all
agreed
that
if
he
had
but
been
a
head
taller
they
had
never
seen
a
properer
man
aha
such
a
gay
young
does
not
come
hither
for
naught
drink
first
man
and
tell
us
thy
business
after
and
he
reached
the
horn
to
hereward
hereward
took
it
and
sang
in
this
brave
ranald
i
pledge
in
good
liquor
which
lightens
long
labor
on
good
liquor
which
sweetens
the
song
of
the
thy
voice
is
as
fine
as
thy
feathers
man
nay
drink
it
all
we
ourselves
drink
here
by
the
peg
at
midday
but
a
stranger
is
welcome
to
fill
his
inside
all
hours
of
the
whereon
hereward
finished
the
horn
duly
and
at
ranald
s
bidding
sat
him
down
on
the
high
settle
he
did
not
remark
that
as
he
sat
down
two
handsome
youths
rose
and
stood
behind
him
now
then
sir
priest
quoth
the
king
go
on
with
your
a
priest
irish
by
his
face
and
dress
who
sat
on
the
high
bench
rose
and
renewed
an
oration
which
hereward
s
entrance
had
interrupted
so
o
great
king
as
says
homerus
this
wise
king
called
his
earls
knights
and
housecarles
and
said
unto
them
which
of
these
two
kings
is
in
the
right
who
can
tell
but
mind
you
that
this
king
of
the
enchanters
lives
far
away
in
india
and
we
never
heard
of
him
more
than
his
name
but
this
king
ulixes
and
his
greeks
live
hard
by
and
which
of
the
two
is
it
wiser
to
quarrel
with
him
that
lives
hard
by
or
him
that
lives
far
off
therefore
king
ranald
says
by
the
mouth
of
my
humility
the
great
o
brodar
lord
of
ivark
take
example
by
alcinous
the
wise
king
of
fairy
and
listen
not
to
the
ambassadors
of
those
lying
villains
o
dea
lord
of
slievardagh
maccarthy
king
of
cashel
and
o
sullivan
lord
of
knockraffin
who
all
three
between
them
could
not
raise
kernes
enough
to
drive
off
one
old
widow
s
cow
make
friends
with
me
who
live
upon
your
borders
and
you
shall
go
peaceably
through
my
lands
to
conquer
and
destroy
them
who
live
afar
off
as
they
deserve
the
sons
of
belial
and
and
the
priest
crost
himself
and
sat
down
at
which
speech
hereward
was
seen
to
laugh
why
do
you
laugh
young
sir
the
priest
seems
to
talk
like
a
wise
man
and
is
my
guest
and
an
then
rose
up
hereward
and
bowed
to
the
king
king
ranald
sigtrygsson
it
was
not
for
rudeness
that
i
laughed
for
i
learnt
good
manners
long
ere
i
came
here
but
because
i
find
clerks
alike
all
over
the
how
quick
at
hiding
false
counsel
under
learned
speech
i
know
nothing
of
ulixes
king
nor
of
this
o
brodar
either
and
i
am
but
a
lad
as
you
see
but
i
heard
a
bird
once
in
my
own
country
who
gave
a
very
different
counsel
from
the
priest
speak
on
then
this
lad
is
no
fool
my
merry
men
there
were
three
copses
king
in
our
country
and
each
copse
stood
on
a
hill
in
the
first
there
built
an
eagle
in
the
second
there
built
a
sparhawk
in
the
third
there
built
a
crow
now
the
sparhawk
came
to
the
eagle
and
said
go
shares
with
me
and
we
will
kill
the
crow
and
have
her
wood
to
humph
says
the
eagle
i
could
kill
the
crow
without
your
help
however
i
will
think
of
when
the
crow
heard
that
she
came
to
the
eagle
herself
king
eagle
says
she
why
do
you
want
to
kill
me
who
live
ten
miles
from
you
and
never
flew
across
your
path
in
my
life
better
kill
that
little
rogue
of
a
sparhawk
who
lives
between
us
and
is
always
ready
to
poach
on
your
marches
whenever
your
back
is
turned
so
you
will
have
her
wood
as
well
as
your
you
are
a
wise
crow
said
the
eagle
and
he
went
out
and
killed
the
sparhawk
and
took
his
loud
laughed
king
ranald
and
his
vikings
all
well
spoken
young
man
we
will
take
the
sparhawk
and
let
the
crow
nay
but
quoth
hereward
hear
the
end
of
the
story
after
a
while
the
eagle
finds
the
crow
beating
about
the
edge
of
the
sparhawk
s
wood
oho
says
he
so
you
can
poach
as
well
as
that
little
hooknosed
rogue
and
he
killed
her
too
ah
says
the
crow
when
she
lay
my
blood
is
on
my
own
head
if
i
had
but
left
the
sparhawk
between
me
and
this
great
tyrant
and
so
the
eagle
got
all
three
woods
to
at
which
the
vikings
laughed
more
loudly
than
ever
and
king
ranald
chuckling
at
the
notion
of
eating
up
the
hapless
irish
princes
one
by
one
sent
back
the
priest
not
without
a
present
for
his
church
for
ranald
was
a
pious
man
to
tell
the
great
o
brodar
that
unless
he
sent
into
waterford
by
that
day
week
two
hundred
head
of
cattle
a
hundred
pigs
a
hundredweight
of
clear
honey
and
as
much
of
wax
ranald
would
not
leave
so
much
as
a
alive
in
ivark
the
cause
of
quarrel
of
course
was
too
unimportant
to
be
mentioned
each
had
robbed
and
cheated
the
other
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
last
twenty
years
as
for
the
morality
of
the
transaction
ranald
had
this
salve
for
his
conscience
that
as
he
intended
to
do
to
o
brodar
so
would
o
brodar
have
gladly
done
to
him
had
he
been
living
peaceably
in
norway
and
o
brodar
been
strong
enough
to
invade
and
rob
him
indeed
so
had
o
brodar
done
already
ever
since
he
wore
beard
to
every
chieftain
of
his
own
race
whom
he
was
strong
enough
to
many
a
fair
herd
had
he
driven
off
many
a
fair
farm
burnt
many
a
fair
woman
carried
off
a
slave
after
that
inveterate
fashion
of
lawless
feuds
which
makes
the
history
of
celtic
ireland
from
the
earliest
times
one
dull
and
aimless
catalogue
of
murder
and
devastation
followed
by
famine
and
disease
and
now
as
he
had
done
to
others
so
it
was
to
be
done
to
him
and
now
young
sir
who
seem
as
witty
as
you
are
good
looking
you
may
if
you
will
tell
us
your
name
and
your
business
as
for
the
name
however
if
you
wish
to
keep
it
to
yourself
ranald
sigtrygsson
is
not
the
man
to
demand
it
of
an
honest
hereward
looked
round
and
saw
teague
macmurrough
standing
close
to
him
harp
in
hand
he
took
it
from
him
courteously
enough
put
a
silver
penny
into
the
minstrel
s
hand
and
running
his
fingers
over
the
strings
rose
and
began
outlaw
and
free
thief
landless
and
lawless
through
the
world
fare
i
thoughtless
of
life
soft
is
my
beard
but
hard
my
wake
men
me
call
whom
warrior
or
watchman
never
caught
sleeping
far
in
northumberland
slew
i
the
cleaving
his
at
one
stroke
i
felled
and
so
forth
chanting
all
his
doughty
deeds
with
such
a
voice
and
spirit
joined
to
that
musical
talent
for
which
he
was
afterwards
so
famous
till
the
hearts
of
the
wild
norsemen
rejoiced
and
skall
to
the
stranger
skall
to
the
young
viking
rang
through
the
hall
then
showing
proudly
the
fresh
wounds
on
his
bare
arms
he
sang
of
his
fight
with
the
cornish
ogre
and
his
adventure
with
the
princess
but
always
though
he
went
into
the
most
minute
details
he
concealed
the
name
both
of
her
and
of
her
father
while
he
kept
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
ranald
s
eldest
son
sigtryg
who
sat
at
his
father
s
right
hand
the
young
man
grew
uneasy
red
almost
angry
till
at
last
hereward
sang
a
gold
ring
she
gave
me
right
royally
to
none
will
i
pass
it
for
prayer
or
for
save
to
him
who
can
claim
it
by
love
and
by
troth
plight
let
that
hero
speak
if
that
hero
be
young
sigtryg
half
started
from
his
feet
but
when
hereward
smiled
at
him
and
laid
his
finger
on
his
lips
he
sat
down
again
hereward
felt
his
shoulder
touched
from
behind
one
of
the
youths
who
had
risen
when
he
sat
down
bent
over
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
ah
hereward
we
know
you
do
you
not
know
us
we
are
the
twins
the
sons
of
your

siward

and
siward
the

the
orphans
of
asbiorn
siwardsson
who
fell
at
hereward
sprang
up
struck
the
harp
again
and
sang
outlaw
and
free
thief
my

left
me
and
no

till

whispered
one
of
them
sadly
listen
now
or
never
for
we
have
bad
news
for
you
and
us
your
father
is
dead
and
earl
algar
your
brother
here
in
ireland
outlawed
a
second
a
flood
of
sorrow
passed
through
hereward

heart
he
kept
it
down
and

in

high
heaped
for

to
the

shouted
the
danes
once
more
at
this
outburst
of
heathendom
common
enough
among
their
race
in
times
when
monasticism
made
so
utter
a
divorce
between
the
life
of
the
devotee
and
that
of
the
worldling
that
it
seemed
reasonable
enough
for
either
party
to
have
their
own
heaven
and
their
own
hell
after
all
hereward
was
not
original
in
his
wish
he
had
but
copied
the
which
his
father
s
friend
and
compeer
siward
digre
the
victor
of
dunsinane
had
sung
for
himself
some
three
years
before
all
praised
his
poetry
and
especially
the
quickness
of
his
alliterations
then
a
note
of
the
highest
art
and
the
old
king
filling
not
this
time
the
horn
but
a
golden
goblet
bid
him
drain
it
and
keep
the
goblet
for
his
song
young
sigtryg
leapt
up
and
took
the
cup
to
hereward
such
a
scald
he
said
ought
to
have
no
meaner
than
a
king
s
hereward
drank
it
dry
and
then
fixing
his
eyes
meaningly
on
the
prince
dropt
the
princess
s
ring
into
the
cup
and
putting
it
back
into
sigtryg
s
hand
sang
the
beaker
i
reach
back
more
rich
than
i
took
it
no
gold
will
i
grasp
of
the
king
s
the
till
by
wit
or
by
weapon
i
worthily
win
it
when
brained
by
my
biter
o
brodar
lies
gory
while
over
the
wolf
s
meal
fair
widows
are
does
he
refuse
my
gift
grumbled
ranald
he
has
given
a
fair
reason
said
the
prince
as
he
hid
the
ring
in
his
bosom
leave
him
to
me
for
my
brother
in
arms
he
is
after
which
as
was
the
custom
of
those
parts
most
of
them
drank
too
much
liquor
but
neither
sigtryg
nor
hereward
drank
and
the
two
siwards
stood
behind
their
young
uncle
s
seat
watching
him
with
that
intense
admiration
which
lads
can
feel
for
a
young
man
that
night
when
the
warriors
were
asleep
sigtryg
and
hereward
talked
out
their
plans
they
would
equip
two
ships
they
would
fight
all
the
kinglets
of
cornwall
at
once
if
need
was
they
would
carry
off
the
princess
and
burn
alef
s
town
over
his
head
if
he
said
nay
nothing
could
be
more
simple
than
the
tactics
required
in
an
age
when
might
was
right
then
hereward
turned
to
his
two
nephews
who
lingered
near
him
plainly
big
with
news
and
what
brings
you
here
lads
he
had
hardened
his
heart
and
made
up
his
mind
to
show
no
kindness
to
his
own
kin
the
day
might
come
when
they
might
need
him
then
it
would
be
his
turn
your
father
as
we
told
you
is
so
much
the
better
for
him
and
the
worse
for
england
and
harold
and
the
godwinssons
of
course
are
lords
and
masters
far
and
wide
tosti
has
our
grandfather
siward
s
i
know
that
i
know
too
that
he
will
not
keep
it
long
unless
he
learns
that
northumbrians
are
free
men
and
not
wessex
and
algar
our
uncle
is
outlawed
again
after
king
edward
had
given
him
peaceably
your
father
s
and
why
why
was
he
outlawed
two
years
ago
because
the
godwinssons
hate
him
i
and
algar
is
gone
to
griffin
the
welshman
and
from
him
on
to
dublin
to
get
ships
just
as
he
did
two
years
ago
and
has
sent
us
here
to
get
ships
and
what
will
he
do
with
them
when
he
has
got
them
he
burnt
hereford
last
time
he
was
outlawed
by
way
of
a
wise
deed
minster
and
all
with
ethelbert
s
relics
on
board
and
slew
seven
clergymen
but
they
were
only
honest
canons
with
wives
at
home
and
not
shaveling
monks
so
i
suppose
that
sin
was
easily
shrived
well
i
robbed
a
priest
of
a
few
pence
and
was
outlawed
he
plunders
and
burns
a
whole
minster
and
is
made
a
great
earl
for
it
one
law
for
the
weak
and
one
for
the
strong
young
lads
as
you
will
know
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
and
now
i
suppose
he
will
plunder
and
burn
more
minsters
and
then
patch
up
a
peace
with
harold
again
which
i
advise
him
strongly
to
do
for
i
warn
you
young
lads
and
you
may
carry
that
message
from
me
to
dublin
to
my
good
brother
your
uncle
that
harold
s
little
finger
is
thicker
than
his
whole
body
and
that
false
godwinsson
as
he
is
he
is
the
only
man
with
a
head
upon
his
shoulders
left
in
england
now
that
his
father
and
my
father
and
dear
old
siward
whom
i
loved
better
than
my
father
are
dead
and
the
lads
stood
silent
not
a
little
awed
and
indeed
imposed
on
by
the
cynical
and
tone
which
their
renowned
uncle
had
assumed
at
last
one
of
them
asked
falteringly
then
you
will
do
nothing
for
us
for
you
nothing
against
you
nothing
why
should
i
mix
myself
up
in
my
brother
s
quarrels
will
he
make
that
driveller
at
westminster
reverse
my
outlawry
and
if
he
does
what
shall
i
get
thereby
a
younger
brother
s
portion
a
dirty
of
land
in
kesteven
let
him
leave
me
alone
as
i
leave
him
and
see
if
i
do
not
come
back
to
him
some
day
for
or
against
him
as
he
chooses
with
such
a
host
of
vikings
sons
as
harold
hardraade
himself
would
be
proud
of
by
thor
s
hammer
boys
i
have
been
an
outlaw
but
five
years
now
and
i
find
it
so
cheery
a
life
that
i
do
not
care
if
i
am
an
outlaw
for
fifty
more
the
world
is
a
fine
place
and
a
wide
place
and
it
is
a
very
little
corner
of
it
that
i
have
seen
yet
and
if
you
were
of
my
mettle
you
would
come
along
with
me
and
see
it
throughout
to
the
four
corners
of
heaven
instead
of
mixing
yourselves
up
in
these
paltry
little
quarrels
with
which
our
two
families
are
tearing
england
in
pieces
and
being
murdered
perchance
like
dogs
at
last
by
treachery
as
sweyn
godwinsson
murdered
the
boys
listened
and
hereward
knew
to
whom
he
was
speaking
and
he
had
not
spoken
in
vain
what
do
you
hope
to
get
here
he
went
on
ranald
will
give
you
no
ships
he
will
have
enough
to
do
to
fight
o
brodar
and
he
is
too
cunning
to
thrust
his
head
into
algar
s
we
hoped
to
find
vikings
here
who
would
go
to
any
war
on
the
hope
of
if
there
be
any
i
want
them
more
than
you
and
what
is
more
i
will
have
them
they
know
that
they
will
do
finer
deeds
with
me
for
their
captain
than
burning
a
few
english
homesteads
and
so
may
you
come
with
me
lads
once
and
for
all
come
help
me
to
fight
o
brodar
then
help
me
to
another
little
adventure
which
i
have
on
hand
as
pretty
a
one
as
ever
you
heard
a
minstrel
sing
and
then
we
will
fit
out
a
longship
or
two
and
go
where
fate
leads
to
constantinople
if
you
like
what
can
you
do
better
you
never
will
get
that
earldom
from
tosti
lucky
for
young
waltheof
your
uncle
if
he
gets
it
if
he
and
you
too
are
not
murdered
within
seven
years
for
i
know
tosti
s
humor
when
he
has
rivals
in
his
way
algar
will
protect
us
said
one
i
tell
you
algar
is
no
match
for
the
godwinssons
if
the
died
neither
his
earldom
nor
his
life
would
be
safe
when
i
saw
your
father
asbiorn
lie
dead
at
dunsinane
i
said
there
ends
the
glory
of
the
house
of
the
bear
and
if
you
wish
to
make
my
words
come
false
then
leave
england
to
founder
and
rot
and
fall
to
pieces
as
all
men
say
she
is
doing
without
your
helping
to
hasten
her
ruin
and
seek
glory
and
wealth
too
with
me
around
the
world
the
white
bear
s
blood
is
in
your
veins
lads
take
to
the
sea
like
your
ancestor
and
come
over
the
swan
s
bath
with
me
that
we
will
said
the
two
lads
and
well
they
kept
their
word
chapter
how
hereward
succored
the
princess
of
cornwall
a
second
time
fat
was
the
feasting
and
loud
was
the
harping
in
the
halls
of
alef
the
cornishman
king
of
gweek
savory
was
the
smell
of
fried
pilchard
and
hake
more
savory
still
that
of
roast
porpoise
most
savory
of
all
that
of
fifty
huge
squab
pies
built
up
of
layers
of
apples
bacon
onions
and
mutton
and
at
the
bottom
of
each
a
squab
or
young
cormorant
which
diffused
both
through
the
pie
and
through
the
ambient
air
a
delicate
odor
of
mingled
guano
and
polecat
and
the
occasion
was
worthy
alike
of
the
smell
and
of
the
noise
for
king
alef
finding
that
after
the
ogre
s
death
the
neighboring
kings
were
but
too
ready
to
make
reprisals
on
him
for
his
champion
s
murders
and
robberies
had
made
a
treaty
of
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
with
hannibal
the
son
of
gryll
king
of
marazion
and
had
confirmed
the
same
by
bestowing
on
him
the
hand
of
his
fair
daughter
whether
she
approved
of
the
match
or
not
was
asked
neither
by
king
alef
nor
by
king
hannibal
was
the
morning
the
church
was
to
hallow
the
union
and
after
that
hannibal
grylls
was
to
lead
home
his
bride
among
a
gallant
company
and
as
they
ate
and
drank
and
harped
and
piped
there
came
into
that
hall
four
shabbily
drest
men
one
of
them
a
short
broad
fellow
with
black
and
a
red
beard
and
sat
them
down
sneakingly
at
the
very
lowest
end
of
all
the
benches
in
hospitable
cornwall
especially
on
such
a
day
every
guest
was
welcome
and
the
strangers
sat
peaceably
but
ate
nothing
though
there
was
both
hake
and
pilchard
within
reach
next
to
them
by
chance
sat
a
great
lourdan
of
a
dane
as
honest
brave
and
stupid
a
fellow
as
ever
tugged
at
oar
and
after
a
while
they
fell
talking
till
the
strangers
had
heard
the
reason
of
this
great
feast
and
all
the
news
of
the
country
side
but
whence
did
they
come
not
to
know
it
already
for
all
cornwall
was
talking
thereof
o
they
came
out
of
devonshire
seeking
service
down
west
with
some
merchant
or
rover
being
seafaring
the
stranger
with
the
black
hair
had
been
meanwhile
earnestly
watching
the
princess
who
sat
at
the
board
s
head
he
saw
her
watching
him
in
return
and
with
a
face
sad
enough
at
last
she
burst
into
tears
what
should
the
bride
weep
for
at
such
a
merry
wedding
asked
he
of
his
companion
o
cause
enough
and
he
told
bluntly
enough
the
princess
s
story
and
what
is
more
said
he
the
king
of
waterford
sent
a
ship
over
last
week
with
forty
proper
lads
on
board
and
two
gallant
holders
with
them
to
demand
her
but
for
all
answer
they
were
put
into
the
strong
house
and
there
they
lie
chained
to
a
log
at
this
minute
pity
it
is
and
shame
i
hold
for
i
am
a
dane
myself
and
pity
too
that
such
a
bonny
lass
should
go
to
an
unkempt
welshman
like
this
instead
of
a
tight
smart
viking
s
son
like
the
waterford
the
stranger
answered
nothing
but
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
princess
till
she
looked
at
him
steadfastly
in
return
she
turned
pale
and
red
again
but
after
a
while
she
spoke
there
is
a
stranger
there
and
what
his
rank
may
be
i
know
not
but
he
has
been
thrust
down
to
the
lowest
seat
in
a
house
that
used
to
honor
strangers
instead
of
treating
them
like
slaves
let
him
take
this
dish
from
my
hand
and
eat
joyfully
lest
when
he
goes
home
he
may
speak
scorn
of
bridegroom
and
bride
and
our
cornish
the
servant
brought
the
dish
down
he
gave
a
look
at
the
stranger
s
shabby
dress
turned
up
his
nose
and
pretending
to
mistake
put
the
dish
into
the
hand
of
the
dane
hold
lads
quoth
the
stranger
if
i
have
ears
that
was
meant
for
he
seized
the
platter
with
both
hands
and
therewith
the
hands
both
of
the
cornishman
and
of
the
dane
there
was
a
struggle
but
so
bitter
was
the
stranger
s
grip
that
says
the
chronicler
the
blood
burst
from
the
nails
of
both
his
opponents
he
was
called
a
savage
a
devil
in
man
s
shape
and
other
dainty
names
but
he
was
left
to
eat
his
squab
pie
in
peace
patience
lads
quoth
he
as
he
filled
his
mouth
before
i
take
my
pleasure
at
this
wedding
i
will
hand
my
own
dish
round
as
well
as
any
of
whereat
men
wondered
but
held
their
tongues
and
when
the
eating
was
over
and
the
drinking
began
the
princess
rose
and
came
round
to
drink
the
farewell
health
with
her
maids
behind
her
and
her
harper
before
her
so
was
the
cornish
custom
she
pledged
one
by
one
each
of
the
guests
slave
as
well
as
free
while
the
harper
played
a
tune
she
came
down
at
last
to
the
strangers
her
face
was
pale
and
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
she
filled
a
cup
of
wine
and
one
of
her
maids
offered
it
to
the
stranger
he
put
it
back
courteously
but
firmly
not
from
your
hand
said
he
a
growl
against
his
bad
manners
rose
straightway
and
the
minstrel
who
as
often
happened
in
those
days
was
jester
likewise
made
merry
at
his
expense
and
advised
the
company
to
turn
the
wild
beast
out
of
the
hall
silence
fool
said
the
princess
why
should
he
know
our
ways
he
may
take
it
from
my
hand
if
not
from
and
she
held
out
to
him
the
cup
herself
he
took
it
looking
her
steadily
in
the
face
and
it
seemed
to
the
minstrel
as
if
their
hands
lingered
together
round
the
and
that
he
saw
the
glitter
of
a
ring
like
many
another
of
his
craft
before
and
since
he
was
a
vain
meddlesome
vagabond
and
must
needs
pry
into
a
secret
which
certainly
did
not
concern
him
so
he
could
not
leave
the
stranger
in
peace
and
knowing
that
his
privileged
calling
protected
him
from
that
formidable
fist
he
never
passed
him
by
without
a
sneer
or
a
jest
as
he
wandered
round
the
table
offering
his
harp
in
the
cornish
fashion
to
any
one
who
wished
to
play
and
sing
but
not
to
you
sir
he
that
is
rude
to
a
pretty
girl
when
she
offers
him
wine
is
too
great
a
boor
to
understand
my
it
is
a
fool
s
trick
answered
the
stranger
at
last
to
put
off
what
you
must
do
at
last
if
i
had
but
the
time
i
would
pay
you
for
your
tune
with
a
better
one
than
you
ever
take
the
harp
then
boor
said
the
minstrel
with
a
laugh
and
a
jest
the
stranger
took
it
and
drew
from
it
such
music
as
made
all
heads
turn
toward
him
at
once
then
he
began
to
sing
sometimes
by
himself
and
sometimes
his
comrades
girviorum
tripliciter
joined
their
voices
in
a
in
vain
the
minstrel
jealous
for
his
own
credit
tried
to
snatch
the
harp
away
the
stranger
sang
on
till
all
hearts
were
softened
and
the
princess
taking
the
rich
shawl
from
her
shoulders
threw
it
over
those
of
the
stranger
saying
that
it
was
a
gift
too
poor
for
such
a
scald
scald
roared
the
bridegroom
now
well
in
his
cups
from
the
head
of
the
table
ask
what
thou
wilt
short
of
my
bride
and
my
kingdom
and
it
is
give
me
then
hannibal
grylls
king
of
marazion
the
danes
who
came
from
ranald
of
you
shall
have
them
pity
that
you
have
asked
for
nothing
better
than
such
tarry
ruffians
a
few
minutes
after
the
minstrel
bursting
with
jealousy
and
rage
was
whispering
in
hannibal
s
ear
the
hot
old
punic
footnote
hannibal
still
a
common
name
in
cornwall
is
held
and
not
unlikely
to
have
been
introduced
there
by
the
ancient
phoenician
colonists
blood
flushed
up
in
his
cheeks
and
his
thin
punic
lips
curved
into
a
snaky
smile
perhaps
the
old
punic
treachery
in
his
heart
for
all
that
he
was
heard
to
reply
was
we
must
not
disturb
the
of
a
cornish
the
stranger
nevertheless
and
the
princess
likewise
had
seen
that
bitter
smile
men
drank
hard
and
long
that
night
and
when
daylight
came
the
strangers
were
gone
in
the
morning
the
marriage
ceremony
was
performed
and
then
began
the
pageant
of
leading
home
the
bride
the
minstrels
went
first
harping
and
piping
then
king
hannibal
carrying
his
bride
behind
him
on
a
pillion
and
after
them
a
string
of
servants
and
leading
country
ponies
laden
with
the
bride
s
dower
along
with
them
unarmed
sulky
and
suspicious
walked
the
forty
danes
who
were
informed
that
they
should
go
to
marazion
and
there
be
shipped
off
for
ireland
now
as
all
men
know
those
parts
of
cornwall
flat
and
open
aloft
are
cut
for
many
miles
inland
by
long
branches
of
tide
river
walled
in
by
woods
and
rocks
which
rivers
join
at
last
in
the
great
basin
of
falmouth
harbor
and
by
crossing
one
or
more
of
these
the
bridal
party
would
save
many
a
mile
on
their
road
towards
the
west
so
they
had
timed
their
journey
by
the
tides
lest
finding
low
water
in
the
rivers
they
should
have
to
wade
to
the
waist
deep
in
mud
and
going
down
the
steep
hillside
through
oak
and
ash
and
hazel
copse
they
entered
as
many
as
could
a
great
barge
and
were
rowed
across
some
quarter
of
a
mile
to
land
under
a
jutting
crag
and
go
up
again
by
a
similar
path
into
the
woods
so
the
first
went
up
the
minstrels
in
front
harping
and
piping
till
the
greenwood
rang
king
hannibal
next
with
his
bride
and
behind
him
and
with
a
dane
between
every
two
when
they
had
risen
some
two
hundred
feet
and
were
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
hannibal
turned
and
made
a
sign
to
the
men
behind
him
then
each
pair
of
them
seized
the
dane
between
them
and
began
to
bind
his
hands
behind
his
back
what
will
you
do
with
us
send
you
back
to
ireland
a
king
never
breaks
his
word
but
pick
out
your
right
eyes
first
to
show
your
master
how
much
i
care
for
him
lucky
for
you
that
i
leave
you
an
eye
apiece
to
find
your
friend
the
harper
whom
if
i
catch
i
flay
you
promised
cried
the
princess
and
so
did
you
traitress
and
he
gripped
her
arm
which
was
round
his
waist
till
she
screamed
so
did
you
promise
but
not
to
me
and
you
shall
pass
your
bridal
night
in
my
after
my
has
taught
you
not
to
give
rings
again
to
wandering
the
wretched
princess
shuddered
for
she
knew
too
well
that
such
an
atrocity
was
easy
and
common
enough
she
knew
it
well
why
should
she
not
the
story
of
the
cid
s
daughters
and
the
knights
of
carrion
the
far
more
authentic
one
of
robert
of
belesme
and
many
another
ugly
tale
of
the
early
middle
age
will
prove
but
too
certainly
that
before
the
days
of
chivalry
began
neither
youth
beauty
nor
the
sacred
ties
of
matrimony
could
protect
women
from
the
most
horrible
outrages
at
the
hands
of
those
who
should
have
been
their
protectors
it
was
reserved
for
monks
and
inquisitors
in
the
name
of
religion
and
the
gospel
to
continue
through
after
centuries
those
brutalities
toward
women
of
which
gentlemen
and
knights
had
grown
ashamed
save
when
as
in
the
case
of
the
albigense
crusaders
monks
and
inquisitors
bade
them
torture
mutilate
and
burn
in
the
name
of
him
who
died
on
the
cross
but
the
words
had
hardly
passed
the
lips
of
hannibal
ere
he
reeled
in
the
saddle
and
fell
to
the
ground
a
javelin
through
his
heart
a
strong
arm
caught
the
princess
a
voice
which
she
knew
bade
her
have
no
fear
bind
your
horse
to
a
tree
for
we
shall
want
him
and
wait
three
men
rushed
on
the
nearest
cornishmen
and
hewed
them
down
a
fourth
unbound
the
dane
and
bade
him
catch
up
a
weapon
and
fight
for
his
life
a
second
pair
were
dispatched
a
second
dane
freed
ere
a
minute
was
over
the
cornishmen
struggling
up
the
narrow
path
toward
the
shouts
above
were
overpowered
in
detail
by
continually
increasing
numbers
and
ere
half
an
hour
was
over
the
whole
party
were
freed
mounted
on
the
ponies
and
making
their
way
over
the
downs
toward
the
west
noble
noble
hereward
said
the
princess
as
she
sat
behind
him
on
hannibal
s
horse
i
knew
you
from
the
first
moment
and
my
nurse
knew
you
too
is
she
here
is
she
safe
i
have
taken
care
of
that
she
has
done
us
too
good
service
to
be
left
here
and
be
i
knew
you
in
spite
of
your
hair
by
your
yes
said
hereward
it
is
not
every
man
who
carries
one
gray
eye
and
one
blue
the
more
difficult
for
me
to
go
mumming
when
i
but
how
came
you
hither
of
all
places
in
the
world
when
you
sent
your
nurse
to
me
last
night
to
warn
me
that
treason
was
abroad
it
was
easy
for
me
to
ask
your
road
to
marazion
and
easier
too
when
i
found
that
you
would
go
home
the
very
way
we
came
to
know
that
i
must
make
my
stand
here
or
the
way
you
came
then
where
are
we
going
now
beyond
marazion
to
a
little
cove
i
can
not
tell
its
name
there
lies
sigtryg
your
betrothed
and
three
good
ships
of
there
why
did
he
not
come
for
me
himself
why
because
we
knew
nothing
of
what
was
toward
we
meant
to
have
sailed
straight
up
your
river
to
your
father
s
town
and
taken
you
out
with
a
high
hand
we
had
sworn
an
oath
which
as
you
saw
i
kept
neither
to
eat
nor
drink
in
your
house
save
out
of
your
own
hands
but
the
easterly
wind
would
not
let
us
round
the
lizard
so
we
put
into
that
cove
and
there
i
and
these
two
lads
my
nephews
offered
to
go
forward
as
spies
while
sigtryg
threw
up
an
earthwork
and
made
a
stand
against
the
cornish
we
meant
merely
to
go
back
to
him
and
give
him
news
but
when
i
found
you
as
good
as
wedded
i
had
to
do
what
i
could
while
i
could
and
i
have
done
you
have
my
noble
and
true
champion
said
she
kissing
him
humph
quoth
hereward
laughing
do
not
tempt
me
by
being
too
grateful
it
is
hard
enough
to
gather
honey
like
the
bees
for
other
folks
to
eat
what
if
i
kept
you
myself
now
i
have
got
you
hereward
o
there
is
no
fear
pretty
lady
i
have
other
things
to
think
of
than
making
love
to
you
and
one
is
how
we
are
to
get
to
our
ships
and
moreover
past
marazion
and
hard
work
they
had
to
get
thither
the
country
was
soon
roused
and
up
in
arms
and
it
was
only
by
wandering
a
three
days
circuit
through
bogs
and
moors
till
the
ponies
were
utterly
tired
out
and
left
behind
the
bulkier
part
of
the
dowry
being
left
behind
with
them
that
they
made
their
appearance
on
the
shore
of
mount
s
bay
hereward
leading
the
princess
in
triumph
upon
hannibal
s
horse
after
which
they
all
sailed
away
for
ireland
and
there
like
young
beichan
prepared
another
wedding
with
all
their
hearts
so
full
of
and
this
is
the
episode
of
the
cornish
princess
as
told
by
leofric
of
bourne
the
cunning
minstrel
and
warlike
priest
chapter
vi
how
hereward
was
wrecked
upon
the
flanders
shore
hereward
had
drunk
his
share
at
sigtryg
s
wedding
he
had
helped
to
harry
the
lands
of
o
brodar
till
as
king
ranald
had
threatened
there
was
not
a
left
in
ivark
and
the
poor
folk
died
of
famine
as
they
did
about
every
seven
years
he
had
burst
says
the
chronicler
through
the
irish
camp
with
a
chosen
band
of
berserkers
slain
o
brodar
in
his
tent
brought
off
his
as
a
trophy
and
cut
his
way
back
to
the
danish
army
a
feat
in
which
the
two
siwards
were
grievously
wounded
and
had
in
all
things
shown
himself
a
daring
and
crafty
captain
as
careless
of
his
own
life
as
of
other
folks
then
a
great
had
seized
him
he
would
go
back
and
see
the
old
house
and
the
and
the
meres
and
fens
of
his
boyhood
he
would
see
his
widowed
mother
perhaps
her
heart
was
softened
to
him
by
now
as
his
was
toward
her
and
if
not
he
could
show
her
that
he
could
do
without
her
that
others
thought
him
a
fine
fellow
if
she
did
not
hereward
knew
that
he
had
won
honor
and
glory
for
himself
that
his
name
was
in
the
mouths
of
all
warriors
and
round
the
coasts
as
the
most
likely
young
champion
of
the
time
able
to
rival
if
he
had
the
opportunity
the
prowess
of
harold
hardraade
himself
yes
he
would
go
and
see
his
mother
he
would
be
kind
if
she
was
kind
if
she
were
not
he
would
boast
and
swagger
as
he
was
but
too
apt
to
do
that
he
should
go
back
at
the
risk
of
his
life
that
any
one
who
found
him
on
english
ground
might
kill
him
and
that
many
would
certainly
try
to
kill
him
he
knew
very
well
but
that
only
gave
special
zest
to
the
adventure
martin
lightfoot
heard
this
news
with
joy
i
have
no
more
to
do
here
said
he
i
have
searched
and
asked
far
and
wide
for
the
man
i
want
and
he
is
not
on
the
irish
shores
some
say
he
is
gone
to
the
orkneys
some
to

never

i
shall
find
him
before
i
and
for
whom
art
looking
for
one
thord
gunlaugsson
my
and
what
wantest
with
him
to
put
this
through
his
and
he
showed
his
axe
thy
father
s
brain
look
you
lord
a
man
owes
his
father
naught
and
his
mother
all
at
least
so
hold
i
man
that
is
of
woman
born
say
all
the
world
and
they
say
right
now
if
any
man
hang
up
that
mother
by
hands
and
feet
and
flog
her
to
death
is
not
he
that
is
of
that
mother
born
bound
to
revenge
her
upon
any
man
and
all
the
more
if
that
man
had
first
his
wicked
will
of
that
poor
mother
considering
that
last
lord
i
do
not
know
but
what
i
am
bound
to
avenge
my
mother
s
shame
upon
the
man
even
if
he
had
never
killed
her
no
lord
you
need
not
try
to
talk
this
out
of
my
head
it
has
been
there
nigh
twenty
years
and
i
say
it
over
to
myself
every
night
before
i
sleep
lest
i
should
forget
the
one
thing
which
i
must
do
before
i
die
find
him
i
will
and
find
him
i
shall
if
there
be
justice
in
heaven
so
hereward
asked
ranald
for
ships
and
got
at
once
two
good
vessels
as
payment
for
his
doughty
deeds
one
he
christened
the
from
her
narrow
build
and
long
beak
and
the
other
the
because
he
said
whatever
she
grappled
she
would
never
let
go
till
she
heard
the
bones
crack
they
were
excellent
new
snekrs
nearly
eighty
feet
long
each
with
double
banks
for
twelve
oars
a
side
in
the
waist
which
was
open
save
a
fighting
gangway
along
the
sides
with
high
poop
and
forecastle
decks
and
with
one
large
sail
apiece
embroidered
by
sigtryg
s
princess
and
the
other
ladies
with
a
huge
white
bear
which
hereward
had
chosen
as
his
ensign
as
for
men
there
were
fifty
fellows
as
desperate
as
hereward
himself
to
take
service
with
him
for
that
or
any
other
quest
so
they
ballasted
their
ships
with
great
pebbles
stowed
under
the
thwarts
to
be
used
as
ammunition
in
case
of
boarding
and
over
them
the
barrels
of
ale
and
pork
and
meal
well
covered
with
tarpaulins
they
stowed
in
the
cabins
fore
and
aft
their
weapons
swords
spears
axes
bows
chests
of
leather
bags
of
bowstrings
and
helmets
and
fine
clothes
for
holidays
and
fighting
days
they
hung
their
shields
after
the
old
fashion
along
the
gunwale
and
a
right
gay
show
they
made
and
so
rowed
out
of
waterford
harbor
amid
the
tears
of
the
ladies
and
the
cheers
of
the
men
but
as
it
befell
the
voyage
did
not
prosper
hereward
found
his
vessels
and
had
to
sail
northward
for
fresh
hands
he
got
none
in
dublin
for
they
were
all
gone
to
the
welsh
marches
to
help
earl
alfgar
and
king
griffin
so
he
went
on
through
the
hebrides
intending
of
course
to
plunder
as
he
went
but
there
he
got
but
little
booty
and
lost
several
men
so
he
went
on
again
to
the
orkneys
to
try
for
fresh
hands
from
the
norse
earl
hereof
but
there
befell
a
fresh
mishap
they
were
followed
by
a
whale
which
they
made
sure
was
a
and
boded
more
ill
luck
and
accordingly
they
were
struck
by
a
storm
in
the
pentland
frith
and
the
poor
went
on
shore
on
hoy
and
was
left
there
forever
and
a
day
her
crew
being
hardly
saved
and
very
little
of
her
cargo
however
the
was
now
not
only
manned
but
over
manned
and
hereward
had
to
leave
a
dozen
stout
fellows
in
kirkwall
and
sail
southward
again
singing
cheerily
to
his
men
lightly
the
leaps
after
tempests
gayly
the
glows
after
rain
in
labor
and
daring
lies
luck
for
all
mortals
foul
winds
and
foul
fray
women
but
their
mishaps
were
not
over
yet
they
were
hardly
out
of
stronsay
frith
when
they
saw
the
again
following
them
up
rolling
and
spouting
and
breaching
in
most
uncanny
wise
some
said
that
they
saw
a
gray
woman
on
his
back
and
they
knew
possibly
from
the
look
of
the
sky
but
certainly
from
the
whale
s
behavior
that
there
was
more
heavy
weather
yet
coming
from
the
northward
from
that
day
forward
the
whale
never
left
them
nor
the
wild
weather
neither
they
were
beaten
out
of
all
reckoning
once
they
thought
they
saw
low
land
to
the
eastward
but
what
or
where
who
could
tell
and
as
for
making
it
the
wind
which
had
blown
hard
from
northeast
backed
against
the
sun
and
blew
from
west
from
which
as
well
as
from
the
they
expected
another
gale
from
north
and
round
to
northeast
the
men
grew
sulky
and
fearful
some
were
for
trying
to
run
the
witch
down
and
break
her
back
as
did
frithiof
in
like
case
when
hunted
by
a
whale
with
two
hags
upon
his
back
an
excellent
recipe
in
such
cases
but
somewhat
difficult
in
a
heavy
sea
others
said
that
there
was
a
doomed
man
on
board
and
proposed
to
cast
lots
till
they
found
him
out
and
cast
him
into
the
sea
as
a
sacrifice
to
aegir
the
but
hereward
scouted
that
as
unmanly
and
cowardly
and
sang
with
blood
of
my
bold
ones
with
bale
of
my
comrades
thinks
aegir
his
throat
he
can
slake
though
salt
spray
sweep
in
swan
above
us
true
heroes
together
we
ll
at
last
after
many
days
their
strength
was
all
but
worn
out
they
had
long
since
given
over
rowing
and
contented
themselves
with
running
under
a
canvas
whithersoever
the
storm
should
choose
at
night
a
sea
broke
over
them
and
would
have
swamped
the
had
she
not
been
the
best
of
but
she
only
rolled
the
lee
shields
into
the
water
and
out
again
shook
herself
and
went
on
nevertheless
there
were
three
men
on
the
poop
when
the
sea
came
in
who
were
not
there
when
it
went
out
wet
and
wild
dawned
that
morning
showing
naught
but
gray
sea
and
gray
air
then
sang
hereward
cheerly
my
crow
for
the
weary
and
wet
are
we
water
beladen
wetter
our
comrades
whelmed
by
the
us
aegir
granted
grudging
to
gondul
doomed
to
die
daring
the
whereat
the
hearts
of
the
men
were
much
cheered
all
of
a
sudden
as
is
the
wont
of
gales
at
dawn
the
clouds
rose
tore
up
into
ribbons
and
with
a
fierce
black
shower
or
two
blew
clean
away
disclosing
a
bright
blue
sky
a
green
rolling
sea
and
a
few
miles
off
to
leeward
a
pale
yellow
line
seen
only
as
they
topped
a
wave
but
seen
only
too
well
to
keep
the
ship
off
shore
was
impossible
and
as
they
drifted
nearer
and
nearer
the
line
of
rose
uglier
and
more
formidable
through
the
gray
spray
of
the
surf
we
shall
die
on
shore
but
not
said
martin
do
any
of
you
knights
of
the
know
whether
we
are
going
to
be
drowned
in
christian
waters
i
should
like
a
mass
or
two
for
my
soul
and
shall
die
the
happier
within
sight
of
a
one
dune
is
as
like
another
as
one
pea
we
may
be
anywhere
between
the
texel
and
cap
gris
nez
but
i
think
nearer
the
latter
than
the
so
much
the
worse
for
us
said
another
if
we
had
gone
ashore
among
those
frieslanders
we
should
have
been
only
knocked
on
the
head
outright
but
if
we
fall
among
the
frenchmen
we
shall
be
clapt
in
prison
strong
and
tortured
till
we
find
i
don
t
see
that
said
martin
we
can
all
be
drowned
if
we
like
i
suppose
drowned
we
need
not
be
if
we
be
men
said
the
old
to
hereward
the
tide
is
full
high
and
that
gives
us
one
chance
for
our
lives
keep
her
head
straight
and
row
like
fiends
when
we
are
once
in
the
surf
and
then
beach
her
up
high
and
dry
and
take
what
befalls
and
what
was
likely
to
befall
was
ugly
enough
then
as
centuries
after
all
wrecks
and
wrecked
men
were
public
prey
shipwrecked
mariners
were
liable
to
be
sold
as
slaves
and
the
petty
counts
of
the
french
and
flemish
shores
were
but
too
likely
to
extract
ransom
by
prison
and
torture
as
guy
earl
of
penthieu
would
have
done
so
at
least
william
duke
of
normandy
hinted
by
harold
godwinsson
had
not
william
for
his
own
politic
ends
begged
the
release
of
the
shipwrecked
earl
already
they
had
been
seen
from
the
beach
the
country
folk
who
were
prowling
about
the
shore
after
the
waifs
of
the
storm
deserted
jetsom
and
lagend
and
crowded
to
meet
the
richer
prize
which
was
coming
in
flotsom
to
become
jetsom
in
its
turn
and
put
on
your
harness
and
be
ready
but
neither
strike
nor
shoot
till
i
give
the
word
we
must
land
peaceably
if
we
can
if
not
we
will
die
so
said
hereward
and
took
the
rudder
into
his
own
hand
now
then
as
she
rushed
into
the
breakers
pull
together
rowers
all
and
with
a
the
men
yelled
and
sprang
from
the
thwarts
as
they
tugged
at
the
oars
the
sea
boiled
past
them
surged
into
the
waist
blinded
them
with
spray
she
grazed
the
sand
once
twice
thrice
leaping
forward
gallantly
each
time
and
then
pressed
by
a
huge
wave
drove
high
and
dry
upon
the
beach
as
the
oars
snapt
right
and
left
and
the
men
tumbled
over
each
other
in
heaps
the
peasants
swarmed
down
like
flies
to
a
carcass
but
they
recoiled
as
there
rose
over
the
forecastle
bulwarks
not
the
broad
hats
of
peaceful
buscarles
but
peaked
helmets
round
red
shields
and
glittering
axes
they
drew
back
and
one
or
two
arrows
flew
from
the
crowd
into
the
ship
but
at
hereward
s
command
no
arrows
were
shot
in
answer
bale
her
out
quietly
and
let
us
show
these
fellows
that
we
are
not
afraid
of
them
that
is
the
best
chance
of
at
this
moment
a
mounted
party
came
down
between
the
sandhills
it
might
be
some
twenty
strong
before
them
rode
a
boy
on
a
jennet
and
by
him
a
clerk
as
he
seemed
upon
a
mule
they
stopped
to
talk
with
the
peasants
and
then
to
consult
among
themselves
suddenly
the
boy
turned
from
his
party
and
galloping
down
the
shore
while
the
clerk
called
after
him
in
vain
reined
up
his
horse
fetlock
deep
in
water
within
ten
yards
of
the
ship
s
bows
yield
yourselves
he
shouted
in
french
as
he
brandished
a
hunting
spear
yield
yourselves
or
die
hereward
looked
at
him
smiling
as
he
sat
there
keeping
the
head
of
his
frightened
horse
toward
the
ship
with
hand
and
heel
his
long
locks
streaming
in
the
wind
his
face
full
of
courage
and
command
and
of
honesty
and
sweetness
withal
and
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
so
fair
a
lad
and
who
art
thou
thou
pretty
bold
boy
asked
hereward
in
french
i
said
he
haughtily
enough
as
resenting
hereward
s
familiar
thou
am
arnulf
grandson
and
heir
of
baldwin
marquis
of
flanders
and
lord
of
this
land
and
to
his
grace
i
call
on
you
to
surrender
hereward
looked
not
only
with
interest
but
respect
upon
the
grandson
of
one
of
the
most
famous
and
prosperous
of
northern
potentates
the
descendant
of
the
mighty
charlemagne
himself
he
turned
and
told
the
men
who
the
boy
was
it
would
be
a
good
trick
quoth
one
to
catch
that
young
whelp
and
keep
him
as
a
here
is
what
will
have
him
on
board
before
he
can
turn
said
another
as
he
made
a
running
noose
in
a
rope
quiet
men
am
i
master
in
this
ship
or
you
hereward
saluted
the
lad
courteously
verily
the
blood
of
baldwin
of
the
iron
arm
has
not
degenerated
i
am
happy
to
behold
so
noble
a
son
of
so
noble
a
and
who
are
you
who
speak
french
so
well
and
yet
by
your
dress
are
neither
french
nor
fleming
i
am
harold
naemansson
the
viking
and
these
my
men
i
am
here
sailing
peaceably
for
england
as
for
yielding
mine
yield
to
no
living
man
but
die
as
we
are
weapon
in
hand
i
have
heard
of
your
grandfather
that
he
is
a
just
man
and
a
bountiful
therefore
take
this
message
to
him
young
sir
if
he
have
wars
toward
i
and
my
men
will
fight
for
him
with
all
our
might
and
earn
hospitality
and
ransom
with
our
only
treasure
which
is
our
swords
but
if
he
be
at
peace
then
let
him
bid
us
go
in
peace
for
we
are
vikings
and
must
fight
or
rot
and
you
are
vikings
cried
the
boy
pressing
his
horse
into
the
foam
so
eagerly
that
the
men
mistaking
his
intent
had
to
be
represt
again
by
hereward
you
are
vikings
then
come
on
shore
and
welcome
you
shall
be
my
friends
you
shall
be
my
brothers
i
will
answer
to
my
grandfather
i
have
longed
to
see
vikings
i
long
to
be
a
viking
by
the
hammer
of
thor
cried
the
old
master
and
thou
wouldst
make
a
bonny
one
my
hereward
hesitated
delighted
with
the
boy
but
by
no
means
sure
of
his
power
to
protect
them
but
the
boy
rode
back
to
his
companions
who
had
by
this
time
ridden
cautiously
down
to
the
sea
and
talked
and
gesticulated
eagerly
then
the
clerk
rode
down
and
talked
with
hereward
are
you
christians
shouted
he
before
he
would
adventure
himself
near
the
ship
christians
we
are
sir
clerk
and
dare
do
no
harm
to
a
man
of
the
clerk
rode
nearer
his
handsome
palfrey
furred
cloak
rich
gloves
and
boots
moreover
his
air
of
command
showed
that
he
was
no
common
man
i
said
he
am
the
abbot
of
bertin
of
sithiu
and
tutor
of
yonder
prince
i
can
bring
down
at
a
word
against
you
the
châtelain
of
omer
with
all
his
knights
besides
knights
and
of
my
own
but
i
am
a
man
of
peace
and
not
of
war
and
would
have
no
blood
shed
if
i
can
help
then
make
peace
said
hereward
your
lord
may
kill
us
if
he
will
or
have
us
for
his
guests
if
he
will
if
he
does
the
first
we
shall
kill
each
of
us
a
few
of
his
men
before
we
die
if
the
latter
we
shall
kill
a
few
of
his
foes
if
you
be
a
man
of
god
you
will
counsel
him
alas
alas
said
the
abbot
with
a
shudder
that
ever
since
adam
s
fall
sinful
man
should
talk
of
nothing
but
slaying
and
being
slain
not
knowing
that
his
soul
is
slain
already
by
sin
and
that
a
worse
death
awaits
him
hereafter
than
that
death
of
the
body
of
which
he
makes
so
light
a
very
good
sermon
my
lord
abbot
to
listen
to
next
sunday
morning
but
we
are
hungry
and
wet
and
desperate
just
now
and
if
you
do
not
settle
this
matter
for
us
our
blood
will
be
on
your
head
and
maybe
your
own
the
abbot
rode
out
of
the
water
faster
than
he
had
ridden
in
and
a
fresh
consultation
ensued
after
which
the
boy
with
a
warning
gesture
to
his
companions
turned
and
galloped
away
through
the
he
is
gone
to
his
grandfather
himself
i
verily
believe
quoth
hereward
they
waited
for
some
two
hours
unmolested
and
true
to
their
policy
of
seeming
recklessness
shifted
and
dried
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
ate
what
provisions
were
unspoilt
by
the
salt
water
and
broaching
the
last
barrel
of
ale
drank
healths
to
each
other
and
to
the
flemings
on
shore
at
last
down
rode
with
the
boy
a
man
and
behind
him
more
knights
and
he
announced
himself
as
manasses
châtelain
of
omer
and
repeated
the
demand
to
surrender
there
is
no
need
for
it
said
hereward

are
already
that
young
prince
s
guests
he
has
said
that
we
shall
be
his
friends
and
brothers

has
said
that
he
will
answer
to
his
grandfather
the
great
marquis
whom
i
and
mine
shall
be
proud
to
serve
i
claim

word
of

cried
the
boy
châtelain
abbot

with
me
and
lodge
in
heaven
forefend
murmured
the
abbot
they
will
be
safe
at
least
within
your
ramparts
whispered
the
châtelain
and
they
shall
tell
me
about
the
sea
have
i
not
told
you
how
i
long
for
vikings
how
i
will
have
vikings
of
my
own
and
sail
the
seas
with
them
like
my
uncle
robert
and
go
to
spain
and
fight
the
moors
and
to
constantinople
and
marry
the
kaiser
s
daughter
come
he
cried
to
hereward
come
on
shore
and
he
that
touches
you
or
your
ship
touches
me
sir
châtelain
and
my
lord
abbot
said
hereward
you
see
that
viking
though
i
be
i
am
no
barbarous
heathen
but
a
gentleman
like
yourselves
it
had
been
easy
for
me
had
i
not
been
a
man
of
honor
to
have
cast
a
rope
as
my
sailors
would
have
had
me
do
over
that
young
boy
s
fair
head
and
haled
him
on
board
to
answer
for
my
life
with
his
own
but
i
loved
him
and
trusted
him
as
i
would
an
angel
out
of
heaven
and
i
trust
him
still
to
him
and
him
only
will
i
yield
myself
on
condition
that
i
and
my
men
shall
keep
all
our
arms
and
treasure
and
enter
his
service
to
fight
his
foes
and
his
grandfather
s
wheresoever
they
will
by
land
or
fair
sir
said
the
abbot
pirate
though
you
call
yourself
you
speak
so
courtly
and
clerkly
that
i
too
am
inclined
to
trust
you
and
if
my
young
lord
will
have
it
so
into
bertin
i
will
receive
you
till
our
lord
the
marquis
shall
give
orders
about
you
and
so
promises
were
given
all
round
and
hereward
explained
the
matter
to
the
men
without
whose
advice
for
they
were
all
as
free
as
himself
he
could
not
act
needs
must
grunted
they
as
they
packed
up
each
his
little
valuables
then
hereward
sheathed
his
sword
and
leaping
from
the
bow
came
up
to
the
boy
put
your
hands
between
his
fair
sir
said
the
châtelain
that
is
not
the
manner
of
and
he
took
the
boy
s
right
hand
and
grasped
it
in
the
plain
english
fashion
there
is
the
hand
of
an
honest
man
come
down
men
and
take
this
young
lord
s
hand
and
serve
him
in
the
wars
as
i
will
one
by
one
the
men
came
down
and
each
took
arnulf
s
hand
and
shook
it
till
the
lad
s
face
grew
red
but
none
of
them
bowed
or
made
obeisance
they
looked
the
boy
full
in
the
face
and
as
they
stepped
back
stared
round
upon
the
ring
of
armed
men
with
a
smile
and
something
of
a
swagger
these
are
they
who
bow
to
no
man
and
call
no
man
master
whispered
the
abbot
and
so
they
were
and
so
are
their
descendants
of
scotland
and
northumbria
unto
this
very
day
the
boy
sprang
from
his
horse
and
walked
among
them
and
round
them
in
delight
he
admired
and
handled
their
double
axes
their
short
of
horn
and
their
red
danish
jerkins
their
blue
fastened
on
the
shoulder
with
rich
brooches
and
the
gold
and
silver
bracelets
on
their
wrists
he
wondered
at
their
long
shaggy
beards
and
still
more
at
the
blue
patterns
with
which
the
english
among
them
hereward
especially
were
tattooed
on
throat
and
arm
and
knee
yes
you
are
vikings
just
such
as
my
uncle
robert
tells
me
hereward
knew
well
the
exploits
of
robert
le
frison
in
spain
and
greece
i
trust
that
your
noble
uncle
he
asked
is
well
he
was
one
of
us
poor
and
sailed
the
swan
s
path
gallantly
till
he
became
a
mighty
prince
here
is
a
man
here
who
was
with
your
noble
uncle
in
and
he
thrust
forward
the
old
master
the
boy
s
delight
knew
no
bounds
he
should
tell
him
all
about
that
in
bertin
then
he
rode
back
to
the
ship
and
round
and
round
her
for
the
tide
by
that
time
had
left
her
high
and
dry
and
wondered
at
her
long
lines
and
carven
stem
and
stern
tell
me
about
this
ship
let
me
go
on
board
of
her
i
have
never
seen
a
ship
inland
at
mons
there
and
even
here
there
are
only
heavy
ugly
busses
and
little
no
you
must
be
all
hungry
and
tired
we
will
go
to
bertin
at
once
and
you
shall
be
feasted
royally
hearken
villains
shouted
he
to
the
peasants
this
ship
belongs
to
the
fair
sir
here
my
guest
and
friend
and
if
any
man
dares
to
steal
from
her
a
stave
or
a
nail
i
will
have
his
thief
s
hand
cut
the
ship
fair
lord
said
hereward
is
yours
not
mine
you
should
build
twenty
more
after
her
pattern
and
man
them
with
such
lads
as
these
and
then
go
down
to
miklagard
and
spanialand
that
lie
so
far
on
the
lee
o
as
did
your
noble
uncle
before
and
so
they
marched
inland
after
the
boy
had
dismounted
one
of
his
men
and
put
hereward
on
the
horse
you
gentlemen
of
the
sea
can
ride
as
well
as
sail
said
the
châtelain
as
he
remarked
with
some
surprise
hereward
s
perfect
seat
and
hand
we
should
soon
learn
to
fly
likewise
laughed
hereward
if
there
were
any
booty
to
be
picked
up
in
the
clouds
there
overhead
and
he
rode
on
by
arnulf
s
side
as
the
lad
questioned
him
about
the
sea
and
nothing
else
ah
my
boy
said
hereward
at
last
look
there
and
let
those
be
vikings
who
and
he
pointed
to
the
rich
pastures
broken
by
strips
of
and
snug
farms
which
stretched
between
the
sea
and
the
great
forest
of
flanders
what
do
you
mean
but
hereward
was
silent
it
was
so
like
his
own
native
fens
for
a
moment
there
came
over
him
the
longing
for
a
home
to
settle
down
in
such
a
fair
fat
land
and
call
good
acres
his
own
and
marry
and
beget
stalwart
sons
to
till
the
old
estate
when
he
could
till
no
more
might
not
that
be
a
better
life
at
least
a
happier
one
than
restless
homeless
aimless
adventure
and
now
just
as
he
had
had
a
hope
of
peace
a
hope
of
seeing
his
own
land
his
own
folk
perhaps
of
making
peace
with
his
mother
and
his
king
the
very
waves
would
not
let
him
rest
but
sped
him
forth
a
waif
to
begin
life
anew
fighting
he
cared
not
whom
or
why
in
a
strange
land
so
he
was
silent
and
sad
withal
what
does
he
mean
asked
the
boy
of
the
abbot
he
seems
a
wise
man
let
him
answer
for
the
boy
asked
once
more
lad
lad
said
hereward
waking
as
from
a
dream
if
you
be
heir
to
such
a
fair
land
as
that
thank
god
for
it
and
pray
to
him
that
you
may
rule
it
justly
and
keep
it
in
peace
as
they
say
your
grandfather
and
your
father
do
and
leave
glory
and
fame
and
the
vikings
bloody
trade
to
those
who
have
neither
father
nor
mother
wife
nor
land
but
live
like
the
wolf
of
the
wood
from
one
meal
to
the
i
thank
you
for
those
words
sir
harold
said
the
good
abbot
while
the
boy
went
on
abashed
and
hereward
himself
was
startled
at
his
own
saying
and
rode
silent
till
they
crossed
the
drawbridge
of
bertin
and
entered
that
ancient
fortress
so
strong
that
it
was
the
in
war
time
for
all
the
treasures
of
the
country
and
so
sacred
withal
that
no
woman
dead
or
alive
was
allowed
to
defile
it
by
her
presence
so
that
the
wife
of
baldwin
the
bold
ancestor
of
arnulf
wishing
to
lie
by
her
husband
had
to
remove
his
corpse
from
bertin
to
the
abbey
of
blandigni
where
the
counts
of
flanders
lay
in
glory
for
many
a
generation
the
pirates
entered
not
without
gloomy
distrust
the
gates
of
that
consecrated
fortress
while
the
monks
in
their
turn
were
and
with
some
reason
considerably
frightened
when
they
were
asked
to
entertain
as
guests
forty
norse
rovers
loudly
did
the
elder
among
them
bewail
in
latin
lest
their
guests
should
understand
too
much
the
present
weakness
of
their
monastery
where
bertin
was
left
to
defend
himself
and
his
monks
all
alone
against
the
wicked
world
outside
far
different
had
been
their
case
some
hundred
and
seventy
years
before
then
valeri
and
riquier
of
ponthieu
transported
thither
from
their
own
in
france
for
fear
of
the
invading
northmen
had
joined
their
suffrages
and
merits
to
those
of
bertin
with
such
success
that
the
abbey
had
never
been
defiled
by
the
foot
of
the
heathen
but
alas
the
saints
that
is
their
bodies
after
a
while
became
homesick
and
valeri
appearing
in
a
dream
to
hugh
capet
bade
him
bring
them
back
to
france
in
spite
of
arnulf
count
of
those
parts
who
wished
much
to
retain
so
valuable
an
addition
to
his
household
gods
but
in
vain
hugh
capet
was
a
man
who
took
few
denials
with
knights
and
he
came
and
count
arnulf
had
to
send
home
the
holy
corpses
with
all
humility
and
leave
bertin
all
alone
whereon
valeri
appeared
in
a
dream
to
hugh
capet
and
said
unto
him
because
thou
hast
zealously
done
what
i
commanded
thou
and
thy
successors
shall
reign
in
the
kingdom
of
france
to
everlasting

however
there
was
no
refusing
the
grandson
and
heir
of
count
baldwin
and
the
hearts
of
the
monks
were
comforted
by
hearing
that
hereward
was
a
good
christian
and
that
most
of
his
crew
had
been
at
least
baptized
the
abbot
therefore
took
courage
and
admitted
them
into
the
hospice
with
solemn
warnings
as
to
the
doom
which
they
might
expect
if
they
took
the
value
of
a
from

patrimony
of

less
powerful
or
less
careful
of
his

to
plunder
the
altar
footnote

let
them
remember
too
the
fate
of
their
own
forefathers
the
heathens
of
the
north
and
the
check
which
one
hundred
and
seventy
years
before
they
had
received
under
those
very
walls
they
had
exterminated
the
people
of
walcheren
they
had
taken

they
had
burnt

naught

the

stark
corpses

what
could
withstand
them

they
dared
to
lift
audacious
hands
against

there

they
poured

in

over
the

out

smote
them

their
psalms

of
the
fortress
were
filled

corpses

they
lighted
to
burn
down

gates
turned
their
flames
into
the
norsemen
s
faces
at
the
bidding
of
bertin
and
they
fled
from
that
temporal
fire
to
descend
into
that
which
is
eternal
while
the
gates
of
the
pit
were
too
narrow
for
the
multitude
of
their
miscreant
souls
footnote
this
gallant
feat
was
performed
in
the
so
the
norsemen
heard
and
feared
and
only
cast
longing
eyes
at
the
gold
and
tapestries
of
the
altars
when
they
went
in
to
mass
for
the
good
abbot
gaining
courage
still
further
had
pointed
out
to
hereward
and
his
men
that
it
had
been
surely
by
the
merits
and
suffrages
of
the
blessed
bertin
that
they
had
escaped
a
watery
grave
hereward
and
his
men
for
their
part
were
not
inclined
to
deny
the
theory
that
they
had
miraculously
escaped
from
the
accident
of
the
tide
being
high
they
knew
full
well
and
that
bertin
should
have
done
them
the
service
was
probable
enough
he
of
course
was
lord
and
master
in
his
own
country
and
very
probably
a
few
miles
out
to
sea
likewise
so
hereward
assured
the
abbot
that
he
had
no
mind
to
eat
bertin
s
bread
or
accept
his
favors
without
paying
honestly
for
them
and
after
mass
he
took
from
his
shoulders
a
handsome
silk
cloak
the
only
one
he
had
with
a
great
scotch
cairngorm
brooch
and
bade
them
buckle
it
on
the
shoulders
of
the
great
image
of
bertin
at
which
bertin
was
so
pleased
being
like
many
saints
male
and
female
somewhat
proud
after
their
death
of
the
finery
which
they
despised
during
life
that
he
appeared
that
night
to
a
certain
monk
and
told
him
that
if
hereward
would
continue
duly
to
honor
him
the
blessed
bertin
and
his
monks
at
that
place
he
would
in
his
turn
insure
him
victory
in
all
his
battles
by
land
and
sea
after
which
hereward
stayed
quietly
in
the
abbey
certain
days
and
young
arnulf
in
spite
of
all
remonstrances
from
the
abbot
would
never
leave
his
side
till
he
had
heard
from
him
and
from
his
men
as
much
of
their
adventures
as
they
thought
it
prudent
to
relate

hereward
went
to
the

at
guisnes
the
dominion
of
baldwin
of
lille
baldwin
the
debonair
marquis
of
flanders
and
just
then
the
greatest
potentate
in
europe
after
the
kaiser
of
germany
and
the
kaiser
of
constantinople
extended
from
the
somme
to
the
scheldt
including
thus
much
territory
which
now
belongs
to
france
his
forefathers
had
ruled
there
ever
since
the
days
of
the
foresters
of
charlemagne
who
held
the
vast
forests
against
the
heathens
of
the
fens
and
of
that
famous
baldwin
who
when
the
foul
fiend
rose
out
of
the
scheldt
and
tried
to
drag
him
down
tried
cold
steel
upon
him
being
a
practical
man
and
made
his
ghostly
adversary
feel
so
sorely
the
weight
of
the
iron
arm
that
he
retired
into
his
native
mud
or
even
lower

he
like
a
daring
knight
as
he
was

off
with

her
not

had
verified
the

away

that
one
of

should
dare
to
marry
a

horrible
wickedness

is
no

of
his
repentance

matters

another
motive
for
so
acting
he
fears
lest
baldwin
under
the
weight
of
charles
s
wrath
and
indignation
should
make
alliance
with
the
normans
enemies
of
god
and
the
holy
church
and
thus
an
occasion
arise
of
peril
and
scandal
for
the
people
of
god
whom
charles
ought
to
rule
which
if
it
happened
it
would
be
worse
for
them
and
for
charles
s
own
soul
to
which
very
sensible
and
humane
missive
times
and
creeds
being
considered
charles
answered
after
pouting
and
sulking
by
making
baldwin
king
of
all
between
somme
and
scheldt
and
leaving
him
to
raise
a
royal
race
from
judith
the
wicked
and
the
fair
this
all
happened
about
two
hundred
years
after
there
ruled
over
that
same
land
baldwin
the
debonair
as
marquis
of
the
baldwin
had
had
his
troubles
he
had
fought
the
count
of
holland
he
had
fought
the
emperor
of
germany
during
which
war
he
had
burnt
the
cathedral
of
nimeguen
and
did
other
unrighteous
and
unwise
things
and
had
been
beaten
after
all
baldwin
had
had
his
troubles
and
had
deserved
them
but
he
had
had
his
glories
and
had
deserved
them
likewise
he
had
cut
the
fossé
neuf
or
new
dike
which
parted
artois
from
flanders
he
had
so
beautified
the
cathedral
of
lille
that
he
was
called
baldwin
of
lille
to
his
dying
day
he
had
married
adela
the
queen
countess
daughter
of
the
king
of
france
he
had
become
tutor
of
philip
the
young
king
and
more
or
less
thereby
regent
of
the
north
of
france
and
had
fulfilled
his
office
wisely
and
well
he
had
married
his
eldest
son
baldwin
the
good
to
the
terrible
sorceress
richilda
heiress
of
hainault
wherefore
the
bridegroom
was
named
baldwin
of
mons
he
had
married
one
of
his
daughters
matilda
to
william
of
normandy
afterwards
the
conqueror
and
another
judith
to
tosti
godwinsson
the
son
of
the
great
earl
godwin
of
england
she
afterwards
married
welf
duke
of
bavaria
whereby
it
may
be
the
blood
of
baldwin
of
flanders
runs
in
the
veins
of
queen
victoria
and
thus
there
were
few
potentates
of
the
north
more
feared
and
respected
than
baldwin
the
earl
of
flanders
but
one
sore
thorn
in
the
side
he
had
which
other
despots
after
him
shared
with
him
and
with
even
worse
success
in
extracting
it
namely
the
valiant
men
of
scaldmariland
which
we
now
call
holland
of
them
hereafter
at
the
moment
of
hereward
s
arrival
he
was
troubled
with
a
lesser
thorn
the
count
of
guisnes
who
would
not
pay
him
up
certain
dues
and
otherwise
acknowledge
his
sovereignty
therefore
when
the
châtelain
of
omer
sent
him
word
to
bruges
that
a
strange
viking
had
landed
with
his
crew
calling
himself
harold
naemansson
and
offering
to
take
service
with
him
he
returned
for
answer
that
the
said
harold
might
make
proof
of
his
faith
and
prowess
upon
the
said
count
in
which
if
he
acquitted
himself
like
a
good
knight
baldwin
would
have
further
dealings
with
him
so
the
châtelain
of
omer
with
all
his
knights
and
and
hereward
with
his
marched
northwest
up
to
guisnes
with
little
arnulf
cantering
alongside
in
high
glee
for
it
was
the
first
war
that
he
had
ever
seen
and
they
came
to
the
castle
of
guisnes
and
summoned
the
count
by
trumpet
and
herald
to
pay
or
fight
whereon
the
count
preferring
the
latter
certain
knights
of
his
came
forth
and
challenged
the
knights
of
omer
to
fight
them
man
to
man
whereon
there
was
the
usual
splintering
of
lances
and
slipping
up
of
horses
and
hewing
at
heads
and
shoulders
so
well
defended
in
mail
that
no
one
was
much
hurt
the
archers
and
arbalisters
meanwhile
amused
themselves
with
shooting
at
the
castle
walls
out
of
which
they
chipped
several
small
pieces
of
stone
and
when
they
were
all
tired
they
drew
off
on
both
sides
and
went
in
to
dinner
at
which
hereward
s
men
who
were
accustomed
to
a
more
serious
fashion
of
fighting
stood
by
mightily
amused
and
vowing
it
was
as
pretty
a
play
as
ever
they
saw
in
their
lives
the
next
day
the
same
comedy
was
repeated
let
me
go
in
against
those
knights
sir
châtelain
asked
hereward
who
felt
the
lust
of
battle
tingling
in
him
from
head
to
heel
and
try
if
i
can
not
do
somewhat
towards
deciding
all
this
if
we
fight
no
faster
than
we
did
yesterday
our
beards
will
be
grown
down
to
our
knees
before
we
take
let
my
viking
go
cried
arnulf
let
me
see
him
fight
as
if
he
had
been
a
pet
gamecock
or
bulldog
you
can
break
a
lance
fine
sir
if
it
please
you
said
the
châtelain
i
break
more
than
lances
quoth
hereward
as
he
cantered
off
you
said
he
to
his
men
draw
round
hither
to
the
left
and
when
i
drive
the
frenchmen
to
the
right
make
a
run
for
it
and
get
between
them
and
the
castle
gate
and
we
will
try
the
danish
axe
against
their
horses
then
hereward
spurred
his
horse
shouting
a
bear
a
bear
and
dashed
into
the
press
and
therein
did
mightily
like
any
turpin
or
roland
till
he
saw
lie
on
the
ground
close
to
the
castle
gate
one
of
the
châtelain
s
knights
with
four
guisnes
knights
around
him
then
at
those
knights
he
rode
and
slew
them
every
one
and
mounted
that
wounded
knight
on
his
own
horse
and
led
him
across
the
field
though
the
archers
shot
sore
at
him
from
the
wall
and
when
the
press
of
knights
rode
at
him
his
danish
men
got
between
them
and
the
castle
and
made
a
stand
to
cover
him
then
the
guisnes
knights
rode
at
them
scornfully
crying
what
footpad
churls
have
we
here
who
fancy
they
can
face
horsed
knights
but
they
did
not
know
the
stuff
of
the
danish
men
who
all
shouted
a
bear
a
bear
and
turned
the
lances
points
with
their
targets
and
hewed
off
the
horses
heads
and
would
have
hewed
off
the
riders
likewise
crying
that
the
bear
must
be
fed
had
not
hereward
bidden
them
give
quarter
according
to
the
civilized
fashion
of
france
and
flanders
whereon
all
the
knights
who
were
not
taken
rode
right
and
left
and
let
them
pass
through
in
peace
with
several
prisoners
and
him
whom
hereward
had
rescued
at
which
little
arnulf
was
as
proud
as
if
he
had
done
it
himself
and
the
châtelain
sent
word
to
baldwin
that
the
was
a
prudhomme
of
no
common
merit
while
the
heart
of
the
count
of
guisnes
became
as
water
and
his
knights
both
those
who
were
captives
and
those
who
were
not
complained
indignantly
of
the
unchivalrous
trick
of
the
danes
how
villanous
for
men
on
foot
not
only
to
face
knights
but
to
bring
them
down
to
their
own
standing
ground
by
basely
cutting
off
their
horses
heads
to
which
hereward
answered
that
he
knew
the
rules
of
chivalry
as
well
as
any
of
them
but
he
was
hired
not
to
joust
at
a
tournament
but
to
make
the
count
of
guisnes
pay
his
lord
baldwin
and
make
him
pay
he
would
the
next
day
he
bade
his
men
sit
still
and
look
on
and
leave
him
to
himself
and
when
the
usual
monomachy
began
he
singled
out
the
burliest
and
boldest
knight
whom
he
saw
rode
up
to
him
lance
point
in
air
and
courteously
asked
him
to
come
and
be
killed
in
fair
fight
the
knight
being
says
the
chronicler
magnificent
in
valor
of
soul
and
counsel
of
war
and
held
to
be
as
a
lion
in
fortitude
throughout
the
army
and
seeing
that
hereward
was
by
no
means
a
large
or
heavy
man
replied
as
courteously
that
he
should
have
great
pleasure
in
trying
to
kill
hereward
on
which
they
rode
some
hundred
yards
out
of
the
press
calling
out
that
they
were
to
be
left
alone
by
both
sides
for
it
was
an
honorable
duel
and
turning
their
horses
charged
after
which
act
they
found
themselves
and
their
horses
all
four
in
a
row
sitting
on
their
on
the
ground
amid
the
fragments
of
their
lances
well
ridden
shouted
they
both
at
once
as
they
leaped
up
laughing
and
drew
their
swords
after
which
they
hammered
away
at
each
other
merrily
in
the
devil
s
smithy
the
sparks
flew
and
the
iron
rang
and
all
men
stood
still
to
see
that
gallant
fight
so
they
watched
and
cheered
till
hereward
struck
his
man
such
a
blow
under
the
ear
that
he
dropped
and
lay
like
a
log
i
think
i
can
carry
you
quoth
hereward
and
picking
him
up
he
threw
him
over
his
shoulder
and
walked
toward
his
men
a
bear
a
bear
shouted
they
in
delight
laughing
at
the
likeness
between
hereward
s
attitude
and
that
of
a
bear
waddling
off
on
his
hind
legs
with
his
prey
in
his
arms
he
should
have
killed
his
bullock
outright
before
he
went
to
carry
him
look
there
and
the
knight
awaking
from
his
swoon
struggled
violently
says
leofric
to
escape
but
hereward
though
the
smaller
was
the
stronger
man
and
crushing
him
in
his
arms
walked
on
steadily
knights
to
the
rescue
hoibricht
is
taken
shouted
they
of
guisnes
galloping
towards
him
a
bear
a
bear
to
me
biornssons
to
me
vikings
all
shouted
hereward
and
the
danes
leapt
up
and
ran
toward
him
axe
in
hand
the
châtelain
s
knights
rode
up
likewise
and
so
it
befell
that
hereward
carried
his
prisoner
safe
into
camp
and
who
are
you
gallant
knight
asked
he
of
his
prisoner
hoibricht
nephew
of
eustace
count
of
so
i
suppose
you
will
be
ransomed
till
then
armorer
and
the
hapless
hoibricht
found
himself
chained
and
fettered
and
sent
off
to
hereward
s
tent
under
the
custody
of
martin
lightfoot
the
next
day
says
the
chronicler
the
count
of
guisnes
stupefied
with
grief
at
the
loss
of
his
nephew
sent
the
due
honor
and
service
to
his
prince
besides
gifts
and
and
so
ended
the
troubles
of
baldwin
and
eustace
of
guisnes
chapter
viii
how
a
fair
lady
exercised
the
mechanical
art
to
win
hereward
s
love
the
fair
torfrida
sat
in
an
upper
room
of
her
mother
s
house
in
omer
alternately
looking
out
of
the
window
and
at
a
book
of
mechanics
in
the
garden
outside
the
wryneck
as
is
his
fashion
in
may
was
calling
among
the
gooseberry
bushes
till
the
cobwalls
rang
again
in
the
book
was
a
latin
recipe
for
drying
the
poor
wryneck
and
using
him
as
a
philtre
which
should
compel
the
love
of
any
person
desired
mechanics
it
must
be
understood
in
those
days
were
considered
as
identical
with
mathematics
and
those
again
with
astrology
and
magic
so
that
the
old
chronicler
who
says
that
torfrida
was
skilled
in
the
mechanic
art
uses
the
word
in
the
same
sense
as
does
the
author
of
the
history
of
ramsey
who
tells
us
how
a
certain
holy
bishop
of
dunstan
s
party
riding
down
to
corfe
through
the
forest
saw
the
wicked
elfrida
her
who
had
edward
stabbed
at
corfe
gate
exercising
her
mechanic
art
under
a
great
tree
in
plain
english
performing
heathen
incantations
and
how
when
she
saw
that
she
was
discovered
she
tempted
him
to
deadly
sin
but
when
she
found
him
proof
against
allurement
she
had
him
into
her
bower
and
there
the
enchantress
and
her
ladies
slew
him
by
thrusting
bodkins
under
his
arms
so
that
the
blessed
man
was
martyred
without
any
sign
of
wound
of
all
which
let
every
man
believe
as
much
as
he
list
torfrida
had
had
peculiar
opportunities
of
learning
mechanics
the
fairest
and
richest
damsel
in
omer
she
had
been
left
early
by
her
father
an
orphan
to
the
care
of
a
superstitious
mother
and
of
a
learned
uncle
the
abbot
of
bertin
her
mother
was
a
provençale
one
of
those
arlesiennes
whose
dark
greek
beauty
still
shines
like
diamonds
set
in
jet
in
the
doorways
of
the
quaint
old
city
gay
enough
in
her
youth
she
had
like
a
true
southern
woman
taken
to
superstition
in
her
old
age
and
spent
her
days
in
the
churches
leaving
torfrida
to
do
and
learn
what
she
would
her
nurse
moreover
was
a
lapp
woman
carried
off
in
some
pirating
foray
and
skilled
in
all
the
sorceries
for
which
the
lapps
were
famed
throughout
the
north
her
uncle
partly
from
partly
from
a
pious
hope
that
she
might
enter
religion
and
leave
her
wealth
to
the
church
had
made
her
his
pupil
and
taught
her
the
mysteries
of
books
and
she
had
proved
to
be
a
strangely
apt
scholar
grammar
rhetoric
latin
prose
and
poetry
such
as
were
taught
in
those
days
she
mastered
ere
she
was
grown
up
then
she
fell
upon
romance
and
charlemagne
and
his
paladins
the
heroes
of
troy
alexander
and
his
generals
peopled
her
imagination
she
had
heard
too
of
the
great
necromancer
virgilius
for
into
such
the
middle
age
transformed
the
poet
and
her
fancy
already
excited
by
her
lapp
nurse
s
occult
science
she
began
eagerly
to
court
forbidden
lore
forbidden
indeed
magic
was
by
the
church
in
public
but
as
a
reality
not
as
an
imposture
those
whose
consciences
were
tough
and
their
faith
weak
had
little
scruple
in
applying
to
a
witch
and
asking
help
from
the
powers
below
when
the
saints
above
were
slack
to
hear
them
churchmen
even
were
bold
enough
to
learn
the
mysteries
of
nature
algebra
judicial
astrology
and
the
occult
powers
of
herbs
stones
and
animals
from
the
mussulman
doctors
of
cordova
and
seville
and
like
pope
gerbert
mingle
science
and
magic
in
a
fashion
excusable
enough
in
days
when
true
inductive
science
did
not
exist
nature
had
her
miraculous
powers
how
far
good
how
far
evil
who
could
tell
the
belief
that
god
was
the
sole
maker
and
ruler
of
the
universe
was
confused
and
darkened
by
the
that
the
material
world
had
fallen
under
the
dominion
of
satan
and
his
demons
that
millions
of
spirits
good
and
evil
in
every
degree
exercised
continually
powers
over
crops
and
cattle
mines
and
wells
storms
and
lightning
health
and
disease
riches
honors
and
royalties
too
were
under
the
command
of
the
powers
of
darkness
for
that
generation
which
was
but
too
apt
to
take
its
bible
in
hand
upside
down
had
somehow
a
firm
faith
in
the
word
of
the
devil
and
believed
devoutly
his
somewhat
startling
assertion
that
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
were
his
and
the
glory
of
them
for
to
him
they
were
delivered
and
to
whomsoever
he
would
he
gave
them
while
it
had
a
proportionally
weak
faith
in
our
lord
s
answer
that
they
were
to
worship
and
serve
the
lord
god
alone
how
far
these
powers
extended
how
far
they
might
be
counteracted
how
far
lawfully
employed
were
questions
which
exercised
the
minds
of
men
and
produced
a
voluminous
literature
for
several
centuries
till
the
search
died
out
for
very
weariness
of
failure
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
abbot
of
bertin
therefore
did
not
hesitate
to
keep
in
his
private
library
more
than
one
volume
which
he
would
not
have
willingly
lent
to
the
simple
monks
under
his
charge
nor
to
torfrida
either
had
she
not
acquired
so
complete
a
command
over
the
good
old
man
that
he
could
deny
her
nothing
so
she
read
of
gerbert
pope
silvester
who
had
died
only
a
generation
back
how
to
quote
william
of
malmesbury
he
learned
at
seville
till
he
surpassed
ptolemy
with
the
astrolabe
alcandrus
in
astronomy
and
julius
firmicus
in
judicial
astrology
how
he
learned
what
the
singing
and
flight
of
birds
portended
and
acquired
the
art
of
calling
up
spirits
from
hell
and
in
short
whatever
hurtful
or
healthful
human
curiosity
had
discovered
besides
the
lawful
sciences
of
arithmetic
and
astronomy
music
and
geometry
how
he
acquired
from
the
saracens
the
abacus
a
counting
table
how
he
escaped
from
the
moslem
magician
his
tutor
by
making
a
compact
with
the
foul
fiend
and
putting
himself
beyond
the
power
of
magic
by
hanging
himself
under
a
wooden
bridge
so
as
to
touch
neither
earth
nor
water
how
he
taught
robert
king
of
france
and
otto
the
kaiser
how
he
made
an
hydraulic
organ
which
played
tunes
by
steam
which
stood
even
then
in
the
cathedral
of
rheims
how
he
discovered
in
the
campus
martius
at
rome
wondrous
treasures
and
a
golden
king
and
queen
golden
courtiers
and
guards
all
lighted
by
a
single
carbuncle
and
guarded
by
a
boy
with
a
bent
bow
who
when
gerbert
s
servant
stole
a
golden
knife
shot
an
arrow
at
that
carbuncle
and
all
was
darkness
and
yells
of
demons
all
this
torfrida
had
read
and
read
too
how
gerbert
s
brazen
head
had
told
him
that
he
should
be
pope
and
not
die
till
he
had
sung
mass
at
jerusalem
and
how
both
had
come
true
the
latter
in
mockery
for
he
was
stricken
with
deadly
sickness
in
rome
as
he
sang
mass
at
the
church
called
jerusalem
and
died
horribly
tearing
himself
in
pieces
which
terrible
warning
had
as
little
effect
on
torfrida
as
other
terrible
warnings
have
on
young
folk
who
are
minded
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
so
torfrida
beguiled
her
lonely
life
in
that
dull
town
looking
out
over
dreary
flats
and
muddy
dikes
by
a
whole
of
fantastic
imaginations
and
was
ripe
and
ready
for
any
wild
deed
which
her
wild
brain
might
suggest
pure
she
was
all
the
while
generous
and
and
with
a
deep
and
sincere
longing
as
one
soul
in
ten
thousand
has
after
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
but
ambitious
exceedingly
and
that
not
of
monastic
sanctity
she
laughed
to
scorn
the
notion
of
a
nunnery
and
laughed
to
scorn
equally
the
notion
of
marrying
any
knight
however
much
of
a
prudhomme
whom
she
had
yet
seen
her
uncle
and
marquis
baldwin
could
have
between
them
compelled
her
as
an
orphan
heiress
to
marry
whom
they
liked
but
torfrida
had
as
yet
bullied
the
abbot
and
coaxed
the
count
successfully
lances
had
been
splintered
helmets
split
and
more
than
one
life
lost
in
her
honor
but
she
had
only
as
the
best
safeguard
she
could
devise
given
some
hint
of
encouragement
to
one
ascelin
a
tall
knight
of
valeri
the
most
renowned
bully
of
those
parts
by
bestowing
on
him
a
scrap
of
ribbon
and
bidding
him
keep
it
against
all
comers
by
this
means
she
insured
the
personal
chastisement
of
all
other
youths
who
dared
to
lift
their
eyes
to
her
while
she
by
no
means
bound
herself
to
her
spadassin
of
valeri
it
was
all
very
brutal
but
so
was
the
time
and
what
better
could
a
poor
lady
do
in
days
when
no
man
s
life
or
woman
s
honor
was
safe
unless
as
too
many
were
forced
to
do
she
retired
into
a
cloister
and
got
from
the
church
that
peace
which
this
world
certainly
could
not
give
and
happily
dared
not
take
away
the
arrival
of
hereward
and
his
men
had
of
course
stirred
the
great
current
of
her
life
and
indeed
that
of
omer
usually
as
stagnant
as
that
of
the
dikes
round
its
wall
who
the
unknown
champion
was
for
his
name
of
naemansson
showed
that
he
was
concealing
something
at
least
whence
he
had
come
and
what
had
been
his
previous
exploits
busied
all
the
gossips
of
the
town
would
he
and
his
men
rise
and
plunder
the
abbey
was
not
the
châtelain
mad
in
leaving
young
arnulf
with
him
all
day
madder
still
in
taking
him
out
to
battle
against
the
count
of
guisnes
he
might
be
a
spy
the
of
some
great
invading
force
he
was
come
to
spy
out
the
nakedness
of
the
land
and
would
shortly
vanish
to
return
with
harold
hardraade
of
norway
or
sweyn
of
denmark
and
all
their
hosts
nay
was
he
not
harold
hardraade
himself
in
disguise
and
so
forth
all
which
torfrida
heard
and
thought
within
herself
that
be
he
who
he
might
she
should
like
to
look
on
him
again
then
came
the
news
how
the
very
first
day
that
he
had
gone
out
against
the
count
of
guisnes
he
had
gallantly
rescued
a
wounded
man
a
day
or
two
after
came
fresh
news
of
some
doughty
deed
and
then
another
and
another
and
when
hereward
returned
after
a
week
s
victorious
fighting
all
omer
was
in
the
street
to
stare
at
him
then
torfrida
heard
enough
and
had
it
been
possible
more
than
enough
of
hereward
and
his
prowess
and
when
they
came
riding
in
the
great
marquis
at
the
head
of
them
all
with
robert
le
frison
on
one
side
of
him
and
on
the
other
hereward
looking
as
fresh
as
flowers
in
may
she
looked
down
on
him
out
of
her
little
lattice
in
the
gable
and
loved
him
once
and
for
all
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
and
hereward
looked
up
at
her
and
her
dark
blue
eyes
and
dark
raven
locks
and
thought
her
the
fairest
thing
that
he
had
ever
seen
and
asked
who
she
might
be
and
heard
and
as
he
heard
he
forgot
all
about
the
sultan
s
daughter
and
the
princess
of
constantinople
and
the
fairy
of
brocheliaunde
and
all
the
other
pretty
birds
which
were
still
in
the
bush
about
the
wide
world
and
thought
for
many
a
day
of
naught
but
the
pretty
bird
which
he
held
so
conceited
was
he
of
his
own
powers
of
winning
her
there
safe
in
hand
in
omer
so
he
cast
about
to
see
her
and
to
win
her
love
and
she
cast
about
to
see
him
and
win
his
love
but
neither
saw
the
other
for
a
while
and
it
might
have
been
better
for
one
of
them
had
they
never
seen
the
other
again
if
torfrida
could
have
foreseen
and
foreseen
and
foreseen
why
if
she
were
true
woman
she
would
have
done
exactly
what
she
did
and
taken
the
bitter
with
the
sweet
the
unknown
with
the
known
as
we
all
must
do
in
life
unless
we
wish
to
live
and
die
alone
chapter
ix
how
hereward
went
to
the
war
in
scaldmariland
it
has
been
shown
how
the
count
of
guisnes
had
been
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
baldwin
of
lille
and
how
that
thorn
was
drawn
out
by
hereward
but
a
far
sharper
thorn
in
his
side
and
one
which
had
troubled
many
a
count
before
and
was
destined
to
trouble
others
afterward
was
those
unruly
hollanders
or
frisians
who
dwelt
in
scaldmariland
the
land
of
the
meres
of
the
beyond
the
vast
forests
of
flanders
in
morasses
and
alluvial
islands
whose
names
it
is
impossible
now
to
verify
so
much
has
the
land
changed
both
by
inundations
and
by
embankments
by
the
brute
forces
of
nature
and
the
noble
triumphs
of
art
dwelt
a
folk
poor
savage
living
mostly
as
in
caesar
s
time
in
huts
raised
above
the
sea
on
piles
or
mounds
of
earth
often
without
cattle
or
seedfield
half
savage
half
heathen
but
free
free
with
the
divine
instinct
of
freedom
and
all
the
and
energy
which
spring
thereout
they
were
a
mongrel
race
and
as
most
mongrel
races
are
when
sprung
from
parents
not
too
far
apart
in
blood
a
strong
race
the
remnant
of
those
old
frisians
and
batavians
who
had
defied
and
all
but
successfully
resisted
the
power
of
rome
mingled
with
fresh
crosses
of
teutonic
blood
from
frank
sueve
saxon
and
the
other
german
tribes
who
after
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
had
swept
across
the
land
their
able
modern
historian
has
well
likened
the
struggle
between
civilis
and
the
romans
to
that
between
william
the
silent
and
the
spaniard
it
was
without
doubt
the
foreshadow
of
their
whole
history
they
were
distinguished
above
most
european
races
for
sturdy
independence
and
what
generally
accompanies
it
sturdy
common
sense
they
could
not
understand
why
they
should
obey
foreign
frank
rulers
whether
set
over
them
by
dagobert
or
by
charlemagne
they
could
not
understand
why
they
were
to
pay
tithes
to
foreign
frank
priests
who
had
forced
on
them
at
the
sword
s
point
a
religion
which
they
only
half
believed
and
only
half
understood
many
a
truly
holy
man
preached
to
them
to
the
best
of
his
powers
but
the
cross
of
boniface
had
too
often
to
follow
the
sword
of
charles
martel
and
for
every
frisian
who
was
converted
another
was
killed
free
frisians
nevertheless
they
remained
at
least
in
name
and
in
their
as
long
as
the
wind
blows
out
of
the
clouds
and
the
world
the
feudal
system
never
took
root
in
their
soil
footnote
motley
rise
of
the
dutch
if
a
frank
count
was
to
govern
them
he
must
govern
according
to
their
own
laws
again
and
again
they
rebelled
even
against
that
seemingly
light
rule
again
and
again
they
brought
down
on
themselves
the
wrath
of
their
nominal
sovereigns
the
counts
of
flanders
then
of
the
kaisers
of
germany
and
in
the
thirteenth
century
of
the
inquisition
itself
then
a
crusade
was
preached
against
them
as
stadings
heretics
who
paid
no

monks
and

and

it
may

not
the
spirit
of
the
race
that
crushed
down
and
seemingly
enslaved
during
the
middle
age
under
count
dirk
and
his
descendants
still
lived
destined
at
last
to
conquer
they
were
a
people
who
had
determined
to
see
for
themselves
and
act
for
themselves
in
the
universe
in
which
they
found
themselves
and
moreover
a
necessary
corollary
of
such
a
resolution
to
fight
to
the
death
against
any
one
who
interfered
with
them
in
so
doing
again
and
again
therefore
the
indomitable
spirit
rose
founding
free
towns
with
charters
and
guilds
embanking
the
streams
draining
the
meres
fighting
each
other
and
the
neighboring
princes
till
in
their
last
great
struggle
against
the
pope
and
spain
they
rose
once
and
for
all
heated
hot
with
burning
fears
and
bathed
in
baths
of
hissing
tears
and
battered
with
the
strokes
of
doom
to
shape
and
use
as
the
great
protestant
dutch
republic
a
noble
errand
it
had
been
for
such
a
man
as
hereward
to
help
those
men
toward
freedom
instead
of
helping
frank
counts
to
enslave
them
men
of
his
own
blood
with
laws
and
customs
like
those
of
his
own
living
in
a
land
so
exactly
like
his
own
that
every
mere
and
fen
and
wood
reminded
him
of
the
scenes
of
his
boyhood
the
very
names
of
the
two
lands
were
alike
holland
the
hollow
land
the
one
of
england
the
other
of
flanders
but
all
this
was
hidden
from
hereward
to
do
as
he
would
be
done
by
was
a
lesson
which
he
had
never
been
taught
if
men
had
invaded
his
land
he
would
have
cried
like
the
frisians
whom
he
was
going
to
enslave
i
am
free
as
long
as
the
wind
blows
out
of
the
clouds
and
died
where
he
stood
but
that
was
not
the
least
reason
why
he
should
not
invade
any
other
man
s
land
and
try
whether
or
not
he
too
would
die
where
he
stood
to
him
these
frieslanders
were
simply
savages
probably
heathens
who
would
not
obey
their
lawful
lord
who
was
a
gentleman
and
a
christian
besides
renown
and
possibly
a
little
plunder
might
be
got
by
beating
them
into
obedience
he
knew
not
what
he
did
and
knew
not
likewise
that
as
he
had
done
to
others
so
would
it
be
done
to
him
baldwin
had
at
that
time
made
over
his
troublesome
hollanders
to
his
younger
son
robert
the
viking
whom
little
arnulf
longed
to
imitate
florent
count
of
holland
and
vassal
of
the
great
marquis
had
just
died
leaving
a
pretty
young
widow
to
whom
the
hollanders
had
no
mind
to
pay
one
stiver
more
than
they
were
forced
all
the
isles
of
zeeland
and
the
counties
of
eonham
and
alost
were
doing
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
their
own
eyes
and
finding
themselves
none
the
worse
therefor
though
the
countess
gertrude
doubtless
could
buy
fewer
silks
of
greece
or
gems
of
italy
but
to
such
a
distressed
lady
a
champion
could
not
long
be
wanting
and
robert
after
having
been
driven
out
of
spain
by
the
moors
with
fearful
loss
and
in
a
second
attempt
wrecked
with
all
his
fleet
as
soon
as
he
got
out
of
port
resolved
to
tempt
the
main
no
more
and
leave
the
swan
s
path
for
that
of
the
fat
oxen
and
black
of
holland
so
he
rushed
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
the
countess
gertrude
and
his
father
whose
good
sense
foresaw
that
the
fiery
robert
would
raise
storms
upon
his
path
happily
for
his
old
age
he
did
not
foresee
the
worst
let
him
go
with
his
blessing
so
robert
gathered
to
him
valiant
ruffians
as
many
as
he
could
find
and
when
he
heard
of
the
viking
who
had
brought
eustace
of
guisnes
to
reason
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
a
man
who
would
do
his
work
so
when
the
great
marquis
came
down
to
omer
to
receive
the
homage
of
count
eustace
of
guisnes
robert
came
thither
too
and
saw
hereward
you
have
done
us
good
service
harold
naemansson
as
it
pleases
you
to
be
called
said
baldwin
smiling
but
some
man
s
son
you
are
if
ever
i
saw
a
gallant
knight
by
his
looks
as
well
as
his
hereward
bowed
and
for
me
said
robert
naemansson
or
earl
s
son
here
is
my
viking
s
welcome
to
all
vikings
like
and
he
held
out
his
hand
hereward
took
it
you
failed
in
galicia
beausire
only
because
your
foes
were
a
hundred
to
one
you
will
not
fail
where
you
are
going
if
as
i
hear
they
are
but
ten
to
robert
laughed
vain
and
gratified
then
you
know
where
i
have
been
and
where
i
am
going
why
not
as
you
know
well
we
vikings
are
all
brothers
and
all
know
each
other
s
counsel
from
ship
to
ship
and
port
to
then
the
two
young
men
looked
each
other
in
the
face
and
each
saw
that
the
other
was
a
man
who
would
suit
him
skall
to
the
viking
cried
robert
aping
as
was
his
fancy
the
norse
rovers
slang
will
you
come
with
me
to
holland
you
must
ask
my
young
lord
there
and
he
pointed
to
arnulf
i
am
his
man
now
by
all
laws
of
a
flush
of
jealousy
passed
over
robert
s
face
he
haplessly
for
himself
thought
that
he
had
a
grievance
the
rights
of
primogeniture
d
were
not
respected
in
the
family
of
the
baldwins
as
they
should
have
been
had
prudence
and
common
sense
had
their
way
no
sacred
or
divine
right
is
conferred
by
the
fact
of
a
man
s
being
the
son
if
scripture
be
scripture
the
lord
s
anointed
was
usually
rather
a
younger
son
of
talent
and
virtue
one
born
not
according
to
the
flesh
but
according
to
the
spirit
like
david
and
solomon
and
so
it
was
in
other
realms
besides
flanders
during
the
middle
age
the
father
handed
on
the
work
for
ruling
was
hard
work
in
those
days
to
the
son
most
able
to
do
it
therefore
we
can
believe
lambert
of
aschaffenbourg
when
he
says
that
in
count
baldwin
s
family
for
many
ages
he
who
pleased
his
father
most
took
his
father
s
name
and
was
hereditary
prince
of
all
flanders
while
the
other
brothers
led
an
inglorious
life
of
vassalage
to
him
but
we
can
conceive
likewise
that
such
a
method
would
give
rise
to
intrigues
envyings
calumnies
murders
fratracidal
civil
wars
and
all
the
train
of
miseries
which
for
some
years
after
this
history
made
infamous
the
house
of
baldwin
as
they
did
many
another
noble
house
till
they
were
stopped
by
the
gradual
adoption
of
the
rational
rule
of
primogeniture
so
robert
who
might
have
been
a
daring
and
useful
friend
to
his
brother
had
he
been
forced
to
take
for
granted
from
birth
that
he
was
nobody
and
his
brother
everybody
as
do
all
younger
sons
of
english
noblemen
to
their
infinite
benefit
held
himself
to
be
an
injured
man
for
life
because
his
father
called
his
baldwin
and
promised
him
the
succession
which
indeed
he
had
worthily
deserved
according
to
the
laws
of
mammon
and
this
world
by
bringing
into
the
family
such
an
heiress
as
richilda
and
such
a
dowry
as
mons
but
robert
who
thought
himself
as
good
as
his
brother
though
he
was
not
such
save
in
valor
nursed
black
envy
in
his
heart
hard
it
was
to
him
to
hear
his
elder
brother
called
baldwin
of
mons
when
he
himself
had
not
a
foot
of
land
of
his
own
harder
still
to
hear
him
called
baldwin
the
good
when
he
felt
in
himself
no
title
whatsoever
to
that
epithet
hardest
of
all
to
see
a
beautiful
boy
grow
up
as
heir
both
of
flanders
and
of
hainault
had
he
foreseen
whither
that
envy
would
have
led
him
had
he
foreseen
the
hideous
and
fratracidal
day
of
february
and
that
fair
boy
s
golden
locks
rolling
in
dust
and
blood
the
wild
viking
would
have
crushed
the
growing
snake
within
his
bosom
for
he
was
a
knight
and
a
gentleman
but
it
was
hidden
from
his
eyes
he
had
to
dree
his
weird
to
commit
great
sins
do
great
deeds
and
die
in
his
bed
mighty
and
honored
having
children
to
his
heart
s
desire
and
leaving
the
rest
of
his
substance
to
his
babes
heaven
help
him
and
the
like
of
him
but
he
turned
to
young
arnulf
give
me
your
man
boy
arnulf
pouted
he
wanted
to
keep
his
viking
for
himself
and
said
so
he
is
to
teach
me
to
go
leding
as
the
norsemen
call
it
like
robert
laughed
a
hint
at
his
piratical
attempts
pleased
his
vanity
all
the
more
because
they
had
been
signal
failures
lend
him
me
then
my
pretty
nephew
for
a
month
or
two
till
he
has
conquered
these
friesland
frogs
for
me
and
then
if
thou
wilt
go
leding
with
him
i
hope
you
may
never
come
back
thought
robert
to
himself
but
he
did
not
say
it
let
the
knight
go
quoth
baldwin
let
me
go
with
him
no
by
all
saints
i
can
not
have
thee
poked
through
with
a
friesland
pike
or
rotted
with
a
friesland
arnulf
pouted
still
abbot
what
hast
thou
been
at
with
the
boy
he
thinks
of
naught
but
blood
and
wounds
instead
of
books
and
he
is
gone
mad
after
this
this
the
abbot
said
hereward
knows
by
hearing
of
his
ears
that
i
bid
him
bide
at
home
and
try
to
govern
lands
in
peace
like
his
father
and
you
sir
eh
the
abbot
told
honestly
what
had
passed
between
hereward
and
the
lad
as
they
rode
to
bertin
baldwin
was
silent
thinking
and
smiling
jollily
as
was
the
wont
of
the
debonair

are
a
man
of
sense
beausire

said
he
at
last
and
he
hereward
and
robert
went
into
an
inner
room

down
on
the
settle
by
it
is
too
great
an
nonsense
man

that
i
need
not
be
ashamed
of
having
you
as
sit
hereward
obeyed
of
course
tell
me
who

out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes

and
perplexed
tell
me

robert
who

are
man
and
be
done
with
it
i
believe

already
i
have
asked

and
wandering
knights
and
pirate
rascals

you
found
that
i
was
a
pirate
rascal
i
found
a
pirate
rascal
who
met

years
since
and

gray
eye

quoth
robert
that

to

s
words
were
true
he
found
for
everybody
helped
everybody
against
everybody
else
as
will
be
seen
and
yet
quarrelled
with
nobody
at
least
in
his
old
age
by
the
mere
virtue
of
good
nature
which
blessed
is
the
man
who
possesseth
so
hereward
went
off
to
exterminate
the
wicked
hollanders
and
avenge

wrongs
of
the
countess
gertrude
chapter
x
how
hereward
won
the
magic
armor
torfrida
had
special
opportunities
of
hearing
about
hereward
for
young
arnulf
was
to
her
a
pet
and
almost
a
and
gladly
escaped
from
the
convent
to
tell
her
the
news
he
had
now
had
his
first
taste
of
the
royal
game
of
war
he
had
seen
hereward
fight
by
day
and
heard
him
tell
stories
over
the
by
night
hereward
s
beauty
hereward
s
prowess
hereward
s
songs
hereward
s
strange
adventures
and
wanderings
were
forever
in
the
young
boy
s
mouth
and
he
spent
hours
in
helping
torfrida
to
guess
who
the
great
unknown
might
be
and
then
went
back
to
hereward
and
artlessly
told
him
of
his
beautiful
friend
and
how
they
had
talked
of
him
and
of
nothing
else
and
in
a
week
or
two
hereward
knew
all
about
torfrida
and
torfrida
knew
what
filled
her
heart
with
joy
that
hereward
was
bound
to
no
and
owned
so
he
had
told
arnulf
no
mistress
save
the
sword
on
his
thigh
whereby
there
had
grown
up
in
the
hearts
of
both
the
man
and
the
maid
a
curiosity
which
easily
became
the
parent
of
love
but
when
baldwin
the
great
marquis
came
to
omer
to
receive
the
homage
of
eustace
of
guisnes
young
arnulf
had
run
into
torfrida
s
chamber
in
great
anxiety
would
his
grandfather
approve
of
what
he
had
done
would
he
allow
his
new
friendship
with
the
unknown
what
care
i
said
torfrida
but
if
your
friend
wishes
to
have
the
marquis
s
favor
he
would
be
wise
to
trust
him
at
least
so
far
as
to
tell
his
i
have
told
him
so
i
have
told
him
that
you
would
tell
him
i
have
you
been
talking
to
him
about
me
why
not
that
is
not
well
done
arnulf
to
talk
of
ladies
to
men
whom
they
do
not
arnulf
looked
up
puzzled
and
pained
for
she
spoke
haughtily
i
know
naught
of
your
new
friend
he
may
be
a
man
for
anything
that
i
can
he
is
not
he
is
as
noble
as
i
am
everything
he
says
and
does
every
look
shows
you
are
young
as
you
have
shown
by
talking
of
me
to
him
but
i
have
given
you
my
advice
and
she
moved
languidly
away
let
him
tell
your
grandfather
who
he
is
or
remain
the
boy
went
away
sadly
early
the
next
morning
he
burst
into
torfrida
s
room
as
she
was
dressing
her
hair
how
now
are
these
manners
for
the
heir
of
flanders
he
has
told
all
he
has
and
she
started
and
dropt
her
comb
pick
up
that
comb
girl
you
need
not
go
away
i
have
no
secrets
with
young
i
thought
you
would
be
glad
to
i
what
can
i
want
in
the
matter
save
that
your
grandfather
should
be
satisfied
that
you
are
entertaining
a
man
worthy
to
be
your
guest
and
he
is
worthy
he
has
told
my
grandfather
who
he
but
not
you
no
they
say
i
must
not
know
yet
but
this
i
know
that
they
welcomed
him
when
he
told
them
as
if
he
had
been
an
earl
s
son
and
that
he
is
going
with
my
uncle
robert
against
the
and
if
he
be
an
earl
s
son
how
comes
he
here
wandering
with
rough
seamen
and
hiding
his
honest
name
he
must
have
done
something
of
which
he
is
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
said
arnulf
pouting
what
care
i
i
can
find
out
by
art
magic
if
i
i
don
t
believe
all
that
can
you
find
out
for
instance
what
he
has
on
his
throat
a
but
what
is
under
that
beard
a
you
are
laughing
at
of
course
i
am
as
i
shall
at
any
one
who
challenges
me
to
find
out
anything
so
silly
and
so
i
shall
go
for
she
knew
very
well
that
he
would
come
back
again
nurse
said
torfrida
to
the
old
lapp
woman
when
they
were
alone
find
out
for
me
what
is
the
name
of
this
strange
champion
and
what
he
has
beneath
his
beneath
his
beard
some
scar
i
suppose
or
secret
mark
i
must
know
you
will
find
out
for
your
torfrida
will
you
not
nurse
i
will
make
a
charm
that
will
bring
him
to
you
were
all
the
icebergs
of
quenland
between
you
and
him
and
then
you
can
see
for
no
no
no
not
yet
nurse
and
torfrida
smiled
only
find
me
out
that
one
thing
that
i
must
and
yet
why
she
wanted
to
know
she
could
not
tell
herself
the
old
woman
came
back
to
her
ere
she
went
to
bed
i
have
found
it
out
all
and
more
i
know
where
to
get
scarlet
toadstools
and
i
put
the
juice
in
his
men
s
ale
they
are
laughing
and
roaring
now
every
one
of
but
not
he
no
no
he
is
with
the
marquis
but
in
madness
comes
out
truth
and
that
long
of
his
has
told
us
and
she
told
torfrida
who
hereward
was
and
the
secret
mark
there
is
a
cross
upon
his
throat
beneath
his
chin
pricked
in
after
their
english
torfrida
started
then
then
the
spell
will
not
work
upon
him
the
holy
cross
will
turn
it
it
must
be
a
great
cross
and
a
holy
one
that
will
turn
off
my
charms
said
the
old
hag
with
a
sneer
whatever
it
may
do
against
yours
but
on
the
back
of
his
hand
that
will
be
a
mark
to
know
him
by
there
is
pricked
a
bear
a
white
bear
that
he
and
she
told
the
story
of
the
fairy
bear
which
torfrida
duly
stored
up
in
her
heart
so
he
has
the
cross
on
his
throat
thought
torfrida
to
herself
well
if
it
keep
off
my
charm
it
will
keep
off
others
that
is
one
comfort
and
one
knows
not
what
fairies
or
witches
or
evil
creatures
he
may
meet
with
in
the
forests
and
the
the
discovery
of
hereward
s
rank
did
not
doubtless
lessen
torfrida
s
fancy
for
him
she
was
ambitious
enough
and
proud
enough
of
her
own
lineage
to
be
full
glad
that
her
heart
had
strayed
away
as
it
must
needs
stray
somewhere
to
the
son
of
the
third
greatest
man
in
england
as
for
his
being
an
outlaw
that
mattered
little
he
might
be
inlawed
and
rich
and
powerful
any
day
in
those
uncertain
times
and
for
the
present
his
being
a
wolf
s
head
only
made
him
the
more
interesting
to
her
women
like
to
pity
their
lovers
sometimes
may
all
good
beings
reward
them
for
it
they
love
merely
because
they
pity
and
torfrida
found
it
pleasant
to
pity
the
insolent
young
coxcomb
who
certainly
never
dreamed
of
pitying
himself
when
hereward
went
home
that
night
he
found
the
abbey
of
bertin
in
horrible
confusion
his
men
were
grouped
outside
the
gate
chattering
like
monkeys
the
porter
and
the
monks
from
inside
entreating
them
vainly
to
come
in
and
go
to
bed
quietly
but
they
would
not
they
vowed
and
swore
that
a
great
gulf
had
opened
all
down
the
road
and
that
one
step
more
would
tumble
them
in
headlong
they
manifested
the
most
affectionate
solicitude
for
the
monks
warning
them
on
their
lives
not
to
step
across
the
threshold
or
they
would
be
swallowed
as
martin
who
was
the
maddest
of
the
lot
phrased
it
with
korah
dathan
and
abiram
in
vain
hereward
stormed
assured
them
that
the
supposed
abyss
was
nothing
but
the
gutter
proved
the
fact
by
kicking
martin
over
it
the
men
determined
to
believe
their
own
eyes
and
after
a
while
fell
asleep
in
heaps
in
the
roadside
and
lay
there
till
morning
when
they
woke
declaring
as
did
the
monks
that
they
had
been
all
bewitched
they
knew
not
and
happily
the
lower
orders
both
in
england
and
on
the
continent
do
not
yet
know
the
potent
virtues
of
that
strange
fungus
with
which
lapps
and
samoiedes
have
it
is
said
practised
wonders
for
centuries
past
the
worst
of
the
matter
was
that
martin
lightfoot
who
had
drank
most
of
the
poison
and
had
always
been
dreamy
and
uncanny
in
spite
of
his
shrewdness
and
humor
had
from
that
day
forward
something
very
like
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
but
before
count
robert
and
hereward
could
collect
sufficient
troops
for
the
invasion
of
holland
another
chance
of
being
slain
in
fight
arose
too
tempting
to
be
overlooked
namely
the
annual
tournament
at
pont
de
l
arche
above
rouen
where
all
the
noblest
knights
of
normandy
would
assemble
to
win
their
honor
and
ladies
love
by
hewing
at
each
other
s
sinful
bodies
thither
too
the
best
knights
of
flanders
must
needs
go
and
with
them
hereward
though
no
knight
he
was
allowed
in
flanders
as
he
had
been
in
scotland
to
take
his
place
among
that
honorable
company
for
though
he
still
refused
the
honor
of
knighthood
on
the
ground
that
he
had
as
yet
done
no
deed
deserving
thereof
he
was
held
to
have
deserved
it
again
and
again
and
all
the
more
from
his
modesty
in
declining
it
so
away
they
all
went
to
pont
de
l
arche
a
right
gallant
meinie
and
torfrida
watched
them
go
from
the
lattice
window
and
when
they
had
passed
down
the
street
tramping
and
jingling
and
caracoling
young
arnulf
ran
into
the
house
with
eyes
full
of
tears
because
he
was
not
allowed
to
go
likewise
and
with
a
message
for
torfrida
from
no
other
than
hereward
i
was
to
tell
you
this
and
no
more
that
if
he
meets
your
favor
in
the
field
he
that
wears
it
will
have
hard
work
to
keep
torfrida
turned
pale
as
ashes
first
with
wild
delight
and
then
with
wild
fear
ha
does
he
know
who
sir
ascelin
he
knows
well
enough
why
not
every
one
knows
are
you
afraid
that
he
is
not
a
match
for
that
great
bullock
afraid
who
said
i
was
afraid
sir
ascelin
is
no
bullock
either
but
a
courteous
and
gallant
you
are
as
pale
as
death
and
so
never
mind
what
i
am
said
she
putting
her
hands
over
his
eyes
and
kissing
him
again
and
again
as
a
vent
for
her
joy
the
next
few
days
seemed
years
for
length
but
she
could
wait
she
was
sure
of
him
now
she
needed
no
charms
perhaps
thought
she
as
she
looked
in
the
glass
i
was
my
own
and
indeed
she
had
every
fair
right
to
say
so
at
last
news
came
she
was
sitting
over
her
books
her
mother
as
usual
was
praying
in
the
churches
when
the
old
lapp
nurse
came
in
a
knight
was
at
the
door
his
name
he
said
was
siward
the
white
and
he
came
from
hereward
from
hereward
he
was
at
least
alive
he
might
be
wounded
though
and
she
rushed
out
of
the
chamber
into
the
hall
looking
never
more
beautiful
her
color
heightened
by
the
quick
beating
of
her
heart
her
dark
hair
worn
loose
and
long
after
the
fashion
of
those
days
streaming
around
her
and
behind
her
a
handsome
young
man
stood
in
the
armed
from
head
to
foot
you
are
siward
hereward
s
nephew
he
bowed
assent
she
took
him
by
the
hands
and
after
the
fashion
of
those
days
kissed
him
on
the
small
space
on
either
cheek
which
was
left
bare
between
the
and
the
you
are
welcome
hereward
is
is
alive
alive
and
gay
and
all
the
more
gay
at
being
able
to
send
to
the
lady
torfrida
by
me
something
which
was
once
hers
and
now
is
hers
once
and
he
drew
from
his
bosom
the
ribbon
of
the
knight
of
valeri
she
almost
snatched
it
from
his
hand
in
her
delight
at
recovering
her
favor
how
where
did
he
get
this
he
saw
it
in
the
thick
of
the
tournament
on
the
helm
of
a
knight
who
he
knew
had
vowed
to
maim
him
or
take
his
life
and
wishing
to
give
him
a
chance
of
fulfilling
his
vow
rode
him
down
horse
and
man
the
knight
s
norman
friends
attacked
us
in
force
and
we
flemings
with
hereward
at
our
head
beat
them
off
and
overthrew
so
many
that
we
are
almost
all
horsed
at
the
norman
s
expense
three
more
knights
with
their
horses
fell
before
hereward
s
and
what
of
this
favor
he
sends
it
to
its
owner
let
her
say
what
shall
be
done
with
torfrida
was
on
the
point
of
saying
he
has
won
it
let
him
wear
it
for
my
but
she
paused
she
longed
to
see
hereward
face
to
face
to
speak
to
him
if
but
one
word
if
she
allowed
him
to
wear
the
favor
she
must
at
least
have
the
pleasure
of
giving
it
with
her
own
hands
and
she
paused
and
he
is
killed
who
hereward
sir
only
bruised
but
he
shall
be
killed
if
you
god
forbid
then
said
siward
mistaking
her
meaning
all
i
have
to
tell
hereward
is
it
seems
that
he
has
wasted
his
blow
he
will
return
therefore
to
the
knight
of
valeri
his
horse
and
if
the
lady
torfrida
chooses
the
favor
which
he
has
taken
by
mistake
from
its
rightful
and
he
set
his
teeth
and
could
not
prevent
stamping
on
the
ground
in
evident
passion
there
was
a
tone
too
of
deep
disappointment
in
his
voice
which
made
torfrida
look
keenly
at
him
why
should
hereward
s
nephew
feel
so
deeply
about
that
favor
and
as
she
looked
could
that
man
be
the
youth
siward
young
he
was
but
surely
thirty
years
old
at
least
his
face
could
hardly
be
seen
hidden
by
helmet
and
above
and
mailed
up
to
the
mouth
below
but
his
long
mustache
was
that
of
a
grown
man
his
vast
breadth
of
shoulder
his
hard
hand
his
sturdy
limbs
these
surely
belonged
not
to
the
slim
youth
whom
she
had
seen
from
her
lattice
riding
at
hereward
s
side
and
as
she
looked
she
saw
upon
his
hand
the
bear
of
which
her
nurse
had
told
her
you
are
deceiving
me
and
she
turned
first
deadly
pale
and
then
crimson
you
you
are
hereward
himself
i
pardon
me
my
lady
ten
minutes
ago
i
should
have
been
glad
enough
to
have
been
hereward
now
i
am
thankful
enough
that
i
am
only
siward
and
not
hereward
who
wins
for
himself
contempt
by
overthrowing
a
knight
more
fortunate
than
and
he
bowed
and
turned
away
to
go
hereward
hereward
and
in
her
passion
she
seized
him
by
both
his
hands
i
know
you
i
know
that
device
upon
your
hand
at
last
at
last
my
hero
my
idol
how
i
have
longed
for
this
moment
how
i
have
toiled
for
it
and
not
in
vain
good
heavens
what
am
i
saying
and
she
tried
in
her
turn
to
escape
from
hereward
s
mailed
arms
then
you
do
not
care
for
that
man
for
him
here
take
my
favor
wear
it
before
all
the
world
and
guard
it
as
you
only
can
and
let
them
all
know
that
torfrida
is
your
and
with
hands
trembling
with
passion
she
bound
the
ribbon
round
his
helm
yes
i
am
hereward
he
almost
shouted
the
berserker
the
the
the
the
feeder
of
wolf
and
raven
aoi
ere
my
beard
was
grown
i
was
a
match
for
giants
how
much
more
now
that
i
am
a
man
whom
ladies
love
many
a
champion
has
quailed
before
my
very
glance
how
much
more
now
that
i
wear
torfrida
s
gift
aoi
torfrida
had
often
heard
that
wild
of
aoi
of
which
the
early
minstrels
were
so
fond
with
which
the
great
poet
who
wrote
the
song
of
roland
ends
every
paragraph
which
has
now
fallen
displaced
by
our
modern
hurrah
to
be
merely
a
sailor
s
call
or
hunter
s
cry
but
she
shuddered
as
she
heard
it
close
to
her
ears
and
saw
from
the
flashing
eye
and
dilated
nostril
the
temper
of
the
man
on
whom
she
had
thrown
herself
so
utterly
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
lips
silence
silence
for
pity
s
sake
remember
that
you
are
in
a
maiden
s
house
and
think
of
her
good
hereward
collected
himself
instantly
and
then
holding
her
at
arm
s
length
gazed
upon
her
i
was
mad
a
moment
but
is
it
not
enough
to
make
me
mad
to
look
at
you
do
not
look
at
me
so
i
can
not
bear
it
said
she
hanging
down
her
head
you
forget
that
i
am
a
poor
weak
ah
we
are
rough
wooers
we
we
can
not
pay
glozing
french
compliments
like
your
knights
here
who
fawn
on
a
damsel
with
soft
words
in
the
hall
and
will
kiss
the
dust
off
their
queen
s
feet
and
die
for
a
hair
of
their
goddess
s
eyebrow
and
then
if
they
catch
her
in
the
forest
show
themselves
as
very
ruffians
as
if
they
were
paynim
moors
we
are
rough
lady
we
english
but
those
who
trust
us
find
us
and
i
can
trust
you
she
asked
still
trembling
on
god
s
cross
there
round
your
neck
and
he
took
her
crucifix
and
kissed
it
you
only
i
love
you
only
i
will
love
and
you
will
i
love
in
all
honesty
before
the
angels
of
heaven
till
we
be
wedded
man
and
wife
who
but
a
fool
would
soil
the
flower
which
he
means
to
wear
before
all
the
world
i
knew
hereward
was
noble
i
knew
i
had
not
trusted
him
in
vain
i
kept
faith
and
honor
with
the
princess
of
cornwall
when
i
had
her
at
my
will
and
shall
i
not
keep
faith
and
honor
with
you
the
princess
of
cornwall
asked
torfrida
do
not
be
jealous
fair
queen
i
brought
her
safe
to
her
betrothed
and
wedded
she
is
long
ago
i
will
tell
you
that
story
some
day
and
now
i
must
not
yet
not
yet
i
have
something
to
to
show
she
motioned
him
to
go
up
the
narrow
stairs
or
rather
ladder
which
led
to
the
upper
floor
and
then
led
him
into
her
chamber
a
lady
s
chamber
was
then
in
days
when
privacy
was
little
cared
for
her
usual
reception
room
and
the
bed
which
stood
in
an
alcove
was
the
common
seat
of
her
and
her
guests
but
torfrida
did
not
ask
him
to
sit
down
she
led
the
way
onward
towards
a
door
beyond
hereward
followed
glancing
with
awe
at
the
books
parchments
and
strange
instruments
which
lay
on
the
table
and
the
floor
the
old
lapp
nurse
sat
in
the
window
sewing
busily
she
looked
up
and
smiled
meaningly
but
as
she
saw
torfrida
unlock
the
further
door
with
one
of
the
keys
which
hung
at
her
girdle
she
croaked
out
too
fast
too
fast
trust
lightly
and
repent
trust
once
and
for
all
or
never
trust
at
all
said
torfrida
as
she
opened
the
door
hereward
saw
within
rich
dresses
hung
on
perches
round
the
wall
and
chests
barred
and
padlocked
these
are
treasures
said
she
which
many
a
knight
and
nobleman
has
coveted
by
cunning
by
flattery
by
threats
of
force
even
have
they
tried
to
win
what
lies
here
and
torfrida
herself
too
for
the
sake
of
her
wealth
but
thanks
to
the
abbot
my
uncle
torfrida
is
still
her
own
mistress
and
mistress
of
the
wealth
which
her
forefathers
won
by
sea
and
land
far
away
in
the
east
all
here
is
mine
and
if
you
be
but
true
to
me
all
mine
is
yours
lift
the
lid
for
me
it
is
too
heavy
for
my
hereward
did
so
and
saw
within
golden
cups
and
bracelets
horns
of
ivory
and
silver
bags
of
coin
and
among
them
a
mail
shirt
and
helmet
on
which
he
fixed
at
once
silent
and
greedy
eyes
she
looked
at
his
face
askance
and
smiled
yes
these
are
more
to
hereward
s
taste
than
gold
and
jewels
and
he
shall
have
them
he
shall
have
them
as
a
proof
that
if
torfrida
has
set
her
love
upon
a
worthy
knight
she
is
at
least
worthy
of
him
and
does
not
demand
without
being
able
to
give
in
and
she
took
out
the
armor
and
held
it
up
to
him
this
is
the
work
of
dwarfs
or
enchanters
this
was
not
forged
by
mortal
man
it
must
have
come
out
of
some
old
cavern
or
dragon
s
hoard
said
hereward
in
astonishment
at
the
extreme
delicacy
and
slightness
of
the
and
the
richness
of
the
gold
and
silver
with
which
both
hauberk
and
helm
were
inlaid
enchanted
it
is
they
say
but
its
maker
who
can
tell
my
ancestor
won
it
and
by
the
side
of
charles
martel
listen
and
i
will
tell
you
how
you
have
heard
of
fair
provence
where
i
spent
my
youth
the
land
of
the
sunny
south
the
land
of
the
fig
and
the
olive
the
mulberry
and
the
rose
the
tulip
and
the
anemone
and
all
rich
fruits
and
fair
flowers
the
land
where
every
city
is
piled
with
temples
and
theatres
and
towers
as
high
as
heaven
which
the
old
romans
built
with
their
enchantments
and
tormented
the
blessed
martyrs
heavens
how
beautiful
you
are
cried
hereward
as
her
voice
shaped
itself
into
a
song
and
her
eyes
flashed
at
the
remembrance
of
her
southern
home
torfrida
was
not
altogether
angry
at
finding
that
he
was
thinking
of
her
and
not
of
her
words
peace
and
listen
you
know
how
the
paynim
held
that
land
the
saracens
to
whom
mahound
taught
all
the
wisdom
of
solomon
as
they
teach
us
in
turn
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
and
how
charles
and
his
paladins
charles
martel
and
charlemagne
were
perpetually
confounded
in
the
legends
of
the
time
drove
them
out
and
conquered
the
country
again
for
god
and
his
i
have
heard
but
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
face
they
were
in
the
theatre
at
arles
the
saracens
where
the
blessed
martyr
trophimus
had
died
in
torments
they
had
set
up
there
their
idol
of
mahound
and
turned
the
place
into
a
fortress
charles
burnt
it
over
their
heads
you
see
i
have
seen
the
blackened
walls
the
marbles
to
this
day
then
they
fled
into
the
plain
and
there
they
turned
and
fought
under
montmajeur
by
the
hermit
s
cell
they
fought
a
summer
s
day
till
they
were
all
slain
there
was
an
emir
among
them
black
as
a
raven
clad
in
magic
armor
all
lances
turned
from
it
all
swords
shivered
on
it
he
rode
through
the
press
without
a
wound
while
every
stroke
of
his
scymitar
shore
off
a
head
of
horse
or
man
charles
himself
rode
at
him
and
smote
him
with
his
hammer
they
heard
the
blow
in
avignon
full
thirty
miles
away
the
flame
flashed
out
from
the
magic
armor
a
fathom
s
length
blinding
all
around
and
when
they
recovered
their
sight
the
enchanter
was
far
away
in
the
battle
killing
as
he
went
then
charles
cried
who
will
stop
that
devil
whom
no
steel
can
wound
help
us
o
blessed
martyr
trophimus
and
save
the
soldiers
of
the
cross
from
shame
then
cried
torfrid
my
forefather
what
use
in
crying
to
trophimus
he
could
not
help
himself
when
the
paynim
burnt
him
and
how
can
he
help
us
a
tough
arm
is
worth
a
score
of
martyrs
and
he
rode
at
that
emir
and
gript
him
in
his
arms
they
both
fell
and
rolled
together
on
the
ground
but
torfrid
never
loosed
his
hold
till
he
had
crushed
out
his
unbaptized
soul
and
sent
it
to
join
mahound
in
hell
then
he
took
his
armor
and
brought
it
home
in
triumph
but
after
a
while
he
fell
sick
of
a
fever
and
the
blessed
trophimus
appeared
to
him
and
told
him
that
it
was
a
punishment
for
his
blasphemy
in
the
battle
so
he
repented
and
vowed
to
serve
the
saint
all
his
life
on
which
he
was
healed
instantly
and
fell
to
religion
and
went
back
to
montmajeur
and
there
he
was
a
hermit
in
the
cave
under
the
rock
and
tended
the
graves
hewn
in
the
living
stone
where
his
old
comrades
the
paladins
who
were
slain
sleep
side
by
side
round
the
church
of
the
holy
cross
but
the
armor
he
left
here
and
he
laid
a
curse
upon
it
that
whosoever
of
his
descendants
should
lose
that
armor
in
fight
should
die
childless
without
a
son
to
wield
a
sword
and
therefore
it
is
that
none
of
his
ancestors
valiant
as
they
have
been
have
dared
to
put
this
harness
on
their
and
so
ended
a
story
which
torfrida
believed
utterly
and
hereward
likewise
and
now
hereward
mine
dare
you
wear
that
magic
armor
and
face
old
torfrid
s
curse
what
dare
i
not
think
if
you
lose
it
in
you
your
race
must
let
it
end
i
accept
the
and
he
put
the
armor
on
but
he
trembled
as
he
did
it
atheism
and
superstition
go
too
often
hand
in
hand
and
godless
as
he
was
sceptical
of
providence
itself
and
much
more
of
the
help
of
saint
or
angel
still
the
curse
of
the
old
warrior
like
the
malice
of
a
witch
or
a
demon
was
to
him
a
thing
possible
probable
and
formidable
she
looked
at
him
in
pride
and
exultation

hereward
for
a
magician
of
this
weary
holland
war
which
dragged
itself
on
campaign
after
campaign
for
several
years
what
need
to
tell
there
was
doubtless
the
due
amount
of
murder
plunder
burning
and
worse
and
the
final
event
was
certain
from
the
beginning
it
was
a
struggle
between
civilized
and
disciplined
men
armed
to
the
teeth
well
furnished
with
ships
and
military
engines
against
poor
simple
folk
in
felt
coats
stiffened
with
tar
or
turpentine
or
in
very
short
jackets
of
hide
says
the
chronicler
who
fought
by
threes
two
with
a
crooked
lance
and
three
darts
each
and
between
them
a
man
with
a
sword
or
an
axe
who
held
his
shield
before
those
two
a
very
great
multitude
but
in
composition
utterly
undisciplined
who
came
down
to
the
with
carts
and
wagons
to
carry
off
the
spoils
of
the
flemings
and
bade
them
all
surrender
at
discretion
and
go
home
again
after
giving
up
count
robert
and
hereward
with
the
tribunes
of
the
brigades
to
be
put
to
death
as
valiant
south
sea
islanders
might
have
done
and
then
found
themselves
as
sheep
to
the
slaughter
before
the
cunning
hereward
whom
they
esteemed
a
magician
on
account
of
his
craft
and
his
invulnerable
armor
so
at
least
says
leofric
s
paraphrast
who
tells
long
confused
stories
of
battles
and
campaigns
some
of
them
without
due
regard
to
chronology
for
it
is
certain
that
the
brave
frisians
could
not
on
robert
s
first
landing
have
feared
lest
they
should
be
conquered
by
foreigners
as
they
had
heard
the
english
were
by
the
french
because
that
event
had
not
then
happened
and
so
much
for
the
war
among
the
meres
of
scheldt
chapter
xii
how
hereward
turned
berserk
torfrida
s
heart
misgave
her
that
first
night
as
to
the
effects
of
her
exceeding
frankness
her
pride
in
the
first
place
was
somewhat
wounded
she
had
dreamed
of
a
knight
who
would
worship
her
as
his
queen
hang
on
her
smile
die
at
her
frown
and
she
had
meant
to
bring
hereward
to
her
feet
as
such
a
slave
in
boundless
gratitude
but
had
he
not
rather
held
his
own
and
brought
her
to
his
feet
by
assuming
her
devotion
as
his
right
and
if
he
assumed
that
how
far
could
she
trust
him
not
to
abuse
his
claim
was
he
quite
as
perfect
seen
close
as
seen
afar
off
and
now
that
the
intoxication
of
that
meeting
had
passed
off
she
began
to
remember
more
than
one
little
fault
which
she
would
have
gladly
seen
mended
certain
roughnesses
of
manner
which
contrasted
unfavorably
with
the
polish
merely
external
though
it
was
of
the
flemish
and
norman
knights
a
boastful
too
which
bordered
on
the
ludicrous
at
whiles
even
in
her
partial
eyes
which
would
be
a
matter
of
open
laughter
to
the
knights
of
the
court
besides
if
they
laughed
at
him
they
would
laugh
at
her
for
choosing
him
and
then
wounded
vanity
came
in
to
help
wounded
pride
and
she
sat
over
the
cold
embers
till
almost
dawn
of
day
her
head
between
her
hands
musing
sadly
and
half
wishing
that
the
irrevocable
yesterday
had
never
come
but
when
after
a
few
months
hereward
returned
from
his
first
campaign
in
holland
covered
with
glory
and
renown
all
smiles
and
beauty
and
health
and
and
gratitude
for
the
magic
armor
which
had
preserved
him
unhurt
then
torfrida
forgot
all
her
fears
and
thought
herself
the
happiest
maid
alive
for
hours
at
least
and
then
came
back
and
after
that
again
and
again
the
old
fears
gradually
she
found
out
that
the
sneers
which
she
had
heard
at
english
barbarians
were
not
altogether
without
ground
not
only
had
her
lover
s
life
been
passed
among
and
wild
adventurers
but
like
the
rest
of
his
nation
he
had
never
felt
the
influence
of
that
classic
civilization
without
which
good
manners
seem
even
to
this
day
almost
beyond
the
reach
of
the
white
man
those
among
whom
she
had
been
brought
up
whether
soldiers
or
clerks
were
probably
no
nobler
or
purer
at
heart
she
would
gladly
have
believed
them
far
less
so
than
hereward
but
the
merest
varnish
of
roman
civilization
had
given
a
charm
to
their
manners
a
wideness
of
range
to
their
thoughts
which
hereward
had
not
especially
when
he
had
taken
too
much
to
drink
which
he
did
after
the
danish
fashion
far
oftener
than
the
rest
of
baldwin
s
men
he
grew
rude
boastful
quarrelsome
he
would
chant
his
own
doughty
deeds
and
gab
as
the
norman
word
was
in
painful
earnest
while
they
gabbed
only
in
sport
and
outvied
each
other
in
impossible
fanfaronades
simply
to
laugh
down
a
fashion
which
was
held
inconsistent
with
the
modesty
of
a
true
knight
bitter
it
was
to
her
to
hear
him
announcing
to
the
company
not
for
the
first
or
second
time
how
he
had
slain
the
cornish
giant
whose
height
increased
by
a
foot
at
least
every
time
he
was
mentioned
and
then
to
hear
him
answered
by
some
smart
youth
who
with
as
much
mimicry
of
his
manner
as
he
dared
to
assume
boasted
of
having
slain
in
araby
a
giant
with
two
heads
and
taken
out
of
his
two
mouths
the
two
halves
of
the
princess
whom
he
was
devouring
which
being
joined
together
afterwards
by
the
prayers
of
a
holy
hermit
were
delivered
back
safe
and
sound
to
her
father
the
king
of
antioch
and
more
bitter
still
to
hear
hereward
angrily
dispute
the
story
unaware
at
least
at
first
that
he
was
being
laughed
at
then
she
grew
sometimes
cold
sometimes
contemptuous
sometimes
altogether
fierce
and
shed
bitter
tears
in
secret
when
she
was
complimented
on
the
modesty
of
her
young
savage
but
she
was
a
brave
maiden
and
what
was
more
she
loved
him
with
all
her
heart
else
why
endure
bitter
words
for
his
sake
and
she
set
herself
to
teach
and
train
the
wild
outlaw
into
her
ideal
of
a
very
perfect
knight
she
talked
to
him
of
modesty
and
humility
the
root
of
all
virtues
of
chivalry
and
of
respect
to
the
weak
and
mercy
to
the
fallen
of
devotion
to
god
and
awe
of
his
commandments
she
set
before
him
the
example
of
ancient
heroes
and
philosophers
of
saints
and
martyrs
and
as
much
awed
him
by
her
learning
as
by
the
new
world
of
higher
and
purer
morality
which
was
opened
for
the
first
time
to
the
wandering
viking
and
he
drank
it
all
in
taught
by
a
woman
who
loved
him
he
could
listen
to
humiliating
truths
which
he
would
have
sneered
at
had
they
come
from
the
lips
of
a
hermit
or
a
priest
often
he
rebelled
often
he
broke
loose
and
made
her
angry
and
himself
ashamed
but
the
spell
was
on
him
a
far
surer
as
well
as
purer
spell
than
any
of
which
foolish
torfrida
had
ever
dreamed
the
only
spell
which
can
really
civilize
man
that
of
woman
s
tact
and
woman
s
purity
but
there
were
relapses
as
was
natural
the
wine
at
robert
the
frison
s
table
was
often
too
good
and
then
hereward
s
tongue
was
loosed
and
torfrida
justly
indignant
and
one
evening
there
came
a
very
serious
relapse
and
out
of
which
arose
a
strange
adventure
for
one
day
the
great
marquis
sent
for
his
son
to
bruges
ere
he
set
out
for
another
campaign
in
holland
and
made
him
a
great
feast
to
which
he
invited
torfrida
and
her
mother
for
adela
of
france
the
queen
countess
had
heard
so
much
of
torfrida
s
beauty
that
she
must
needs
have
her
as
one
of
her
and
her
mother
who
was
an
old
friend
of
adela
s
of
course
was
highly
honored
by
such
a
promotion
for
her
daughter
so
they
went
to
bruges
and
hereward
and
his
men
went
of
course
and
they
feasted
and
harped
and
sang
and
the
saying
was
fulfilled
tis
merry
in
the
hall
when
beards
wag
but
the
only
beard
which
wagged
in
that
hall
was
hereward
s
for
the
flemings
like
the
normans
prided
themselves
on
their
civilized
and
chins
and
laughed
behind
his
back
at
hereward
who
prided
himself
on
keeping
his
beautiful
english
beard
with
locks
of
gold
which
like
his
long
golden
hair
were
combed
and
curled
daily
after
the
fashion
of
the
but
hereward
s
beard
began
to
wag
somewhat
too
fast
as
he
sat
by
torfrida
s
side
when
some
knight
near
began
to
tell
of
a
wonderful
mare
called
swallow
which
was
to
be
found
in
one
of
the
islands
of
the
scheldt
and
was
famous
through
all
the
country
round
insinuating
moreover
that
hereward
might
as
well
have
brought
that
mare
home
with
him
as
a
trophy
hereward
answered
in
his
boasting
vein
that
he
would
bring
home
that
mare
or
aught
else
that
he
had
a
liking
to
you
will
find
it
not
so
easy
her
owner
they
say
is
a
mighty
strong
churl
of
a
dirk
hammerhand
by
name
and
as
for
cutting
his
throat
that
you
must
not
do
for
he
has
been
loyal
to
countess
gertrude
and
sent
her
horses
whenever
she
one
may
pick
a
fair
quarrel
with
him
then
you
must
bide
such
a
buffet
as
you
never
abode
before
they
say
his
arm
has
seven
men
s
strength
and
whosoever
visits
him
he
challenges
to
give
and
take
a
blow
but
every
man
that
has
taken
a
blow
as
yet
has
never
needed
hereward
will
have
need
of
his
magic
if
he
tries
that
adventure
quoth
another
ay
retorted
the
first
speaker
but
the
helmet
may
stand
the
rap
well
enough
and
yet
the
brains
inside
be
the
not
a
doubt
i
knew
a
man
once
who
was
so
strong
that
he
would
shake
a
nut
till
the
kernel
went
to
powder
and
yet
never
break
the
that
is
a
lie
quoth
hereward
and
so
it
was
and
told
purposely
to
make
him
expose
himself
whereon
high
words
followed
which
torfrida
tried
in
vain
to
stop
hereward
was
flushed
with
ire
and
scorn
magic
armor
forsooth
cried
he
at
last
what
care
i
for
armor
or
for
magic
i
will
wager
to
you
my
armor
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
but
he
checked
himself
in
time
any
horse
in
my
stable
that
i
go
in
my
shirt
to
scaldmariland
and
bring
back
that
mare
hark
to
the
englishman
he
has
turned
berserk
at
last
like
his
forefathers
you
will
surely
start
in
a
pair
of
hose
as
well
or
the
ladies
will
be
and
so
forth
till
torfrida
was
purple
with
shame
and
wished
herself
fathoms
deep
and
adela
of
france
called
sternly
from
the
head
of
the
table
to
ask
what
the
wrangling
meant
it
is
only
the
english
berserker
the
lady
torfrida
s
champion
said
some
one
in
his
most
courteous
tone
who
is
not
yet
as
well
acquainted
with
the
customs
of
knighthood
as
that
fair
lady
hopes
to
make
him
torfrida
s
champion
asked
adela
in
a
tone
of
surprise
if
not
scorn
if
any
knight
quarrels
with
my
hereward
he
quarrels
with
robert
himself
thundered
count
robert
silence
and
so
the
matter
was
hushed
up
the
banquet
ended
and
they
walked
out
into
the
garden
to
cool
their
heads
and
play
at
games
and
dance
torfrida
avoided
hereward
but
he
with
the
foolish
pertinacity
of
a
man
who
knows
he
has
had
too
much
wine
and
yet
pretends
to
himself
that
he
has
not
would
follow
her
and
speak
to
her
she
turned
away
more
than
once
at
last
she
was
forced
to
speak
to
him
so
you
have
made
me
a
to
these
knights
you
have
scorned
at
my
gifts
you
have
said
and
before
these
men
too
that
you
need
neither
helm
nor
hauberk
give
me
them
back
then
berserker
as
you
are
and
go
sleep
off
your
that
will
i
laughed
hereward
boisterously
you
are
tipsy
said
she
and
do
not
know
what
you
you
are
angry
and
do
not
know
what
you
say
hearken
proud
lass
i
will
take
care
of
one
thing
and
that
is
that
you
shall
speak
the
did
i
not
say
that
you
were
tipsy
pish
you
said
that
i
was
a
berserker
and
truth
you
shall
speak
for
baresark
i
go
to
the
war
and
baresark
i
win
that
mare
or
that
will
be
very
fit
for
and
the
two
turned
haughtily
from
each
other
ere
torfrida
went
to
bed
that
night
there
was
a
violent
knocking
angry
as
she
was
she
was
yet
anxious
enough
to
hurry
out
of
her
chamber
and
open
the
door
herself
martin
lightfoot
stood
there
with
a
large
leather
case
which
he
flung
at
her
feet
somewhat
unceremoniously
there
is
some
gear
of
yours
said
he
as
it
clanged
and
rattled
on
the
floor
what
do
you
mean
man
only
that
my
master
bid
me
say
that
he
cares
as
little
for
his
own
life
as
you
and
he
turned
away
she
caught
him
by
the
arm
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
what
is
in
this
mail
you
should
know
best
if
young
folks
can
not
be
content
when
they
are
well
off
they
will
go
farther
and
fare
worse
says
martin
lightfoot
and
he
slipt
from
her
grasp
and
fled
into
the
night
she
took
the
mail
to
her
room
and
opened
it
it
contained
the
magic
armor
all
her
anger
was
melted
away
she
cried
she
blamed
herself
he
would
be
killed
his
blood
would
be
on
her
head
she
would
have
carried
it
back
to
him
with
her
own
hands
she
would
have
entreated
him
on
her
knees
to
take
it
back
but
how
face
the
courtiers
and
how
find
him
very
probably
too
he
was
by
that
time
hopelessly
drunk
and
at
that
thought
she
drew
herself
into
herself
and
trying
to
harden
her
heart
again
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
and
bitterly
she
cried
as
she
thought
over
the
old
hag
s
croon
quick
joy
long
pain
you
will
take
your
gift
it
might
have
been
five
o
clock
the
next
morning
when
the
clarion
rang
down
the
street
she
sprang
up
and
drest
herself
quickly
but
never
more
carefully
or
gayly
she
heard
the
tramp
of
he
was
moving
early
indeed
should
she
go
to
the
window
to
bid
him
farewell
should
she
hide
herself
in
just
anger
she
looked
out
stealthily
through
the
blind
of
the
little
window
in
the
gable
there
rode
down
the
street
robert
le
frison
in
full
armor
and
behind
him
knight
after
knight
a
wall
of
shining
steel
but
by
his
side
rode
one
his
long
yellow
curls
floating
over
his
shoulders
his
boots
had
golden
spurs
a
gilt
belt
held
up
his
sword
but
his
only
dress
was
a
silk
shirt
and
silk
hose
he
laughed
and
sang
and
made
his
horse
caracol
and
tossed
his
lance
in
the
air
and
caught
it
by
the
point
like
taillefer
at
hastings
as
he
passed
under
the
window
she
threw
open
the
blind
careless
of
all
appearances
she
would
have
called
to
him
but
the
words
choked
her
and
what
should
she
say
he
looked
up
boldly
and
smiled
farewell
fair
lady
mine
drunk
i
was
last
night
but
not
so
drunk
as
to
forget
a
and
he
rode
on
while
torfrida
rushed
away
and
broke
into
wild
weeping
chapter
xiii
how
hereward
won
mare
swallow
on
a
bench
at
the
door
of
his
wooden
house
sat
dirk
hammerhand
the
richest
man
in
walcheren
from
within
the
house
sounded
the
pleasant
noise
of
grinding
and
chatting
at
the
handquern
from
without
the
pleasant
noise
of
geese
and
fowls
without
number
and
as
he
sat
and
drank
his
ale
and
watched
the
herd
of
horses
in
the
fen
he
thought
himself
a
happy
man
and
thanked
his
odin
and
thor
that
owing
to
his
princely
supplies
of
horses
to
countess
gertrude
robert
the
frison
and
his
christian
franks
had
not
harried
him
to
the
bare
walls
as
they
would
probably
do
ere
all
was
over
as
he
looked
at
the
horses
some
off
he
saw
a
strange
stir
among
them
they
began
whinnying
and
pawing
round
a
thing
in
the
midst
which
might
be
a
badger
or
a
wolf
though
both
were
very
uncommon
in
that
pleasant
isle
of
walcheren
but
which
plainly
had
no
business
there
whereon
he
took
up
a
mighty
staff
and
strode
over
the
fen
to
see
he
found
neither
wolf
nor
badger
but
to
his
exceeding
surprise
a
long
lean
man
clothed
in
ragged
whinnying
and
neighing
exactly
like
a
horse
and
then
stooping
to
eat
grass
like
one
he
advanced
to
do
the
first
thing
which
came
into
his
head
namely
to
break
the
man
s
back
with
his
staff
and
ask
him
afterwards
who
he
might
be
but
ere
he
could
strike
the
man
or
horse
kicked
up
with
his
hind
legs
in
his
face
and
then
springing
on
to
the
said
hind
legs
ran
away
with
extraordinary
swiftness
some
fifty
yards
and
then
went
down
on
and
began
grazing
again
beest
thou
man
or
devil
cried
dirk
somewhat
frightened
the
thing
looked
up
the
face
at
least
was
human
art
thou
a
christian
man
asked
it
in
bad
frisian
intermixed
with
snorts
and
neighs
what
s
that
to
thee
growled
dirk
and
began
to
wish
a
little
that
he
was
one
having
heard
that
the
sign
of
the
cross
was
of
great
virtue
in
driving
away
fiends
thou
art
not
christian
thou
believest
in
thor
and
odin
then
there
is
hope
of
what
dirk
was
growing
more
and
more
frightened
of
her
my
sister
ah
my
sister
can
it
be
that
i
shall
find
thee
at
last
after
ten
thousand
miles
and
thirty
years
of
woeful
wandering
i
have
no
man
s
sister
here
at
least
my
wife
s
brother
was
killed
i
speak
not
of
a
sister
in
a
woman
s
shape
mine
alas
o
woeful
prince
o
more
woeful
princess
eats
the
herb
of
the
field
somewhere
in
the
shape
of
a
mare
as
ugly
as
she
was
once
beautiful
but
swifter
than
the
swallow
on
the
i
ve
none
such
here
quoth
dirk
thoroughly
frightened
and
glancing
uneasily
at
mare
swallow
you
have
not
alas
wretched
me
it
was
prophesied
to
me
by
the
witch
that
i
should
find
her
in
the
field
of
one
who
worshipped
the
old
gods
for
had
she
come
across
a
holy
priest
she
had
been
a
woman
again
long
ago
whither
must
i
wander
afresh
and
the
thing
began
weeping
bitterly
and
then
ate
more
grass
i
that
is
thou
poor
miserable
creature
said
dirk
half
pitying
half
wishing
to
turn
the
subject
leave
off
making
a
beast
of
thyself
awhile
and
tell
me
who
thou
i
have
made
no
beast
of
myself
most
noble
earl
of
the
frisians
for
so
you
doubtless
are
i
was
made
a
beast
of
a
horse
of
by
an
enchanter
of
a
certain
land
and
my
sister
a
thou
dost
not
say
so
quoth
dirk
who
considered
such
an
event
quite
possible
i
was
a
prince
of
the
county
of
alboronia
which
lies
between
cathay
and
the
mountains
of
the
moon
as
fair
once
as
i
am
foul
now
and
only
less
fair
than
my
lost
sister
and
by
the
enchantments
of
a
cruel
magician
we
became
what
we
but
thou
art
not
a
horse
at
all
events
am
i
not
thou
knowest
then
more
of
me
than
i
do
of
myself
and
it
ate
more
grass
but
hear
the
rest
of
my
story
my
hapless
sister
was
sold
away
with
me
to
a
merchant
but
i
breaking
loose
from
him
fled
until
i
bathed
in
a
magic
fountain
at
once
i
recovered
my
man
s
shape
and
was
rejoicing
therein
when
out
of
the
fountain
rose
a
fairy
more
beautiful
than
an
elf
and
smiled
upon
me
with
love
she
asked
me
my
story
and
i
told
it
and
when
it
was
told
wretch
she
cried
and
coward
who
hast
deserted
thy
sister
in
her
need
i
would
have
loved
thee
and
made
thee
immortal
as
myself
but
now
thou
shalt
wander
ugly
and
eating
grass
clothed
in
the
which
has
just
dropped
from
thy
limbs
till
thou
shalt
find
thy
sister
and
bring
her
to
bathe
like
thee
in
this
magic
all
good
spirits
help
us
and
you
are
really
a
prince
as
surely
cried
the
thing
with
a
voice
of
sudden
rapture
as
that
mare
is
my
sister
and
he
rushed
at
mare
swallow
i
see
i
see
my
mother
s
eyes
my
father
s
nose
he
must
have
been
a
king
that
then
grinned
dirk
to
himself
the
mare
s
nose
is
as
big
as
a
but
how
can
she
be
a
princess
man
prince
i
mean
she
has
a
foal
running
by
her
a
foal
said
the
thing
solemnly
let
me
behold
it
alas
alas
my
sister
thy
tyrant
s
threat
has
come
true
that
thou
shouldst
be
his
bride
whether
thou
wouldst
or
not
i
see
i
see
in
the
features
of
thy
son
his
hated
why
he
must
be
as
like
a
horse
then
as
your
father
but
this
will
not
do
master
i
know
that
foal
s
pedigree
better
than
i
do
my
man
man
simple
though
honest
hast
thou
never
heard
of
the
skill
of
the
enchanter
of
the
east
how
they
transform
their
victims
at
night
back
again
into
human
shape
and
by
day
into
the
shape
of
beasts
again
yes
well
i
know
that
and
do
you
not
see
how
you
are
deluded
every
night
doubt
not
that
mare
and
foal
take
their
human
shape
again
and
every
night
perhaps
that
foul
enchanter
visits
in
your
fen
perhaps
in
your
very
stable
his
wretched
and
perhaps
unwilling
an
enchanter
in
my
stable
that
is
an
ugly
guest
but
no
i
ve
been
into
the
stables
fifty
times
to
see
if
that
mare
was
safe
mare
was
mare
and
colt
was
colt
mr
prince
if
i
have
eyes
to
and
what
are
eyes
against
enchantments
the
moment
you
opened
the
door
the
spell
was
cast
over
them
again
you
ought
to
thank
your
stars
that
no
worse
has
happened
yet
that
the
enchanter
in
fleeing
has
not
wrung
your
neck
as
he
went
out
or
cast
a
spell
on
you
which
will
fire
your
barns
lame
your
geese
give
your
fowls
the
pip
your
horses
the
glanders
your
cattle
the
murrain
your
children
the
vitus
dance
your
wife
the
creeping
palsy
and
yourself
the
in
all
your
the
lord
have
mercy
on
me
if
the
half
of
this
be
true
i
will
turn
christian
i
will
send
for
a
priest
and
be
baptized
o
my
sister
my
sister
dost
thou
not
know
me
dost
thou
answer
my
caresses
with
kicks
or
is
thy
heart
as
well
as
thy
body
so
enchained
by
that
cruel
necromancer
that
thou
preferest
to
be
his
and
scornest
thine
own
salvation
leaving
me
to
eat
grass
till
i
die
i
say
prince
i
say
what
would
you
have
a
man
to
do
i
bought
the
mare
honestly
and
i
have
kept
her
well
she
can
t
say
aught
against
me
on
that
score
and
whether
she
be
princess
or
not
i
m
loath
to
part
with
keep
her
then
and
keep
with
her
the
curse
of
all
the
saints
and
angels
look
down
ye
holy
saints
and
the
thing
poured
out
a
long
string
of
saints
names
and
avenge
this
catholic
princess
kept
in
bestial
durance
by
an
unbaptized
heathen
may
his
don
t
don
t
roared
dirk
and
don
t
look
at
me
like
that
for
he
feared
the
evil
eye
or
i
ll
brain
you
with
my
staff
fool
if
i
have
lost
a
horse
s
figure
i
have
not
lost
his
swiftness
ere
thou
couldst
strike
i
should
have
run
a
mile
and
back
to
curse
thee
and
the
thing
ran
round
him
and
fell
on
again
and
ate
grass
mercy
mercy
and
that
is
more
than
i
ever
asked
yet
of
man
but
it
is
hard
growled
he
that
a
man
should
lose
his
money
because
a
rogue
sells
him
a
princess
in
then
sell
her
again
sell
her
as
thou
valuest
thy
life
to
the
first
christian
man
thou
meetest
and
yet
no
what
matters
ere
a
month
be
over
the
seven
years
enchantment
will
have
passed
and
she
will
return
to
her
own
shape
with
her
son
and
vanish
from
thy
farm
leaving
thee
to
vain
repentance
and
so
thou
wilt
both
lose
thy
money
and
get
her
curse
farewell
and
my
malison
abide
with
thee
and
the
thing
without
another
word
ran
right
away
neighing
as
it
went
leaving
dirk
in
a
state
of
abject
terror
he
went
home
he
cursed
the
mare
he
cursed
the
man
who
sold
her
he
cursed
the
day
he
saw
her
he
cursed
the
day
he
was
born
he
told
his
story
with
exaggerations
and
confusions
in
plenty
to
all
in
the
house
and
terror
fell
on
them
likewise
no
one
that
evening
dare
go
down
into
the
fen
to
drive
the
horses
up
and
dirk
got
very
drunk
went
to
bed
and
trembled
there
all
night
as
did
the
rest
of
the
household
expecting
the
enchanter
to
enter
on
a
flaming
at
every
howl
of
the
wind
the
next
morning
as
dirk
was
going
about
his
business
with
a
doleful
face
casting
stealthy
glances
at
the
fen
to
see
if
the
mysterious
mare
was
still
there
and
a
chance
of
his
money
still
left
a
man
rode
up
to
the
door
he
was
poorly
clothed
with
a
long
rusty
sword
by
his
side
a
broad
felt
hat
long
boots
and
a
haversack
behind
his
saddle
showed
him
to
be
a
traveller
seemingly
a
for
there
followed
him
tied
head
and
tail
a
brace
of
sorry
nags
heaven
save
all
here
quoth
he
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
can
any
good
christian
give
me
a
drink
of
milk
ale
if
thou
wilt
said
dirk
but
what
art
thou
and
whence
on
any
other
day
he
would
have
tried
to
coax
his
guest
into
trying
a
buffet
with
him
for
his
horse
and
clothes
but
this
morning
his
heart
was
heavy
with
the
thought
of
the
enchanted
mare
and
he
welcomed
the
chance
of
selling
her
to
the
stranger
we
are
not
very
fond
of
strangers
about
here
since
these
flemings
have
been
harrying
our
borders
if
thou
art
a
spy
it
will
be
worse
for
i
am
neither
spy
nor
fleming
but
a
poor
servant
of
the
lord
bishop
of
utrecht
s
buying
a
garron
or
two
for
his
lordship
s
priests
as
for
these
flemings
may
john
baptist
save
from
them
both
me
and
you
do
you
know
of
any
man
who
has
horses
to
sell
hereabouts
there
are
horses
in
the
fen
yonder
quoth
dirk
who
knew
that
churchmen
were
likely
to
give
a
liberal
price
and
pay
in
good
silver
i
saw
them
as
i
rode
up
and
a
fine
lot
they
are
but
of
too
good
a
stamp
for
my
short
purse
or
for
my
holy
master
s
riding
a
fat
priest
likes
a
quiet
nag
my
humph
well
if
quietness
is
what
you
need
there
is
a
mare
down
there
a
child
might
ride
her
with
a
thread
of
wool
but
as
for
price
and
she
has
a
colt
too
running
by
ah
quoth
the
horseman
well
your
walcheren
folk
make
good
milk
that
s
certain
a
colt
by
her
that
s
awkward
my
lord
does
not
like
young
horses
and
it
would
be
troublesome
too
to
take
the
thing
along
with
the
less
anxious
the
dealer
seemed
to
buy
the
more
anxious
grew
dirk
to
sell
but
he
concealed
his
anxiety
and
let
the
stranger
turn
away
thanking
him
for
his
drink
i
say
he
called
after
him
you
might
look
at
her
as
you
ride
past
the
the
stranger
assented
and
they
went
down
into
the
fen
and
looked
over
the
precious
mare
whose
feats
were
afterwards
sung
by
many
an
english
fireside
or
in
the
forest
beneath
the
hollins
green
by
such
as
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men
the
ugliest
as
well
as
the
swiftest
of
mares
she
was
say
the
old
chroniclers
and
it
was
not
till
the
stranger
had
looked
twice
at
her
that
he
forgot
her
great
chuckle
head
and
drooping
and
began
to
see
the
great
length
of
those
same
quarters
the
thighs
let
down
into
the
hocks
the
arched
loin
the
extraordinary
girth
through
the
saddle
the
sloping
shoulder
the
long
arms
the
flat
knees
the
large
hoofs
and
all
the
other
points
which
showed
her
strength
and
speed
and
justified
her
fame
she
might
carry
a
big
man
like
you
through
the
mud
said
he
carelessly
but
as
for
pace
one
can
not
expect
that
with
such
a
chuckle
head
and
if
one
rode
her
through
a
town
the
boys
would
call
after
one
all
head
and
no
why
i
can
t
see
her
tail
for
her
quarters
it
is
so
ill
set
ill
set
on
or
none
said
dirk
testily
don
t
go
to
speak
against
her
pace
till
you
have
seen
it
here
lass
dirk
was
in
his
heart
rather
afraid
of
the
princess
but
he
was
comforted
when
she
came
up
to
him
like
a
dog
she
s
as
sensible
as
a
woman
said
he
and
then
grumbled
to
himself
may
be
she
knows
i
mean
to
part
with
lend
me
your
saddle
said
he
to
the
stranger
the
stranger
did
so
and
dirk
mounting
galloped
her
in
a
ring
there
was
no
doubt
of
her
powers
as
soon
as
she
began
to
move
i
hope
you
won
t
remember
this
against
me
madam
said
dirk
as
soon
as
he
got
out
of
the
stranger
s
hearing
i
can
t
do
less
than
sell
you
to
a
christian
and
certainly
i
have
been
as
good
a
master
to
you
as
if
i
d
known
who
you
were
but
if
you
wish
to
stay
with
me
you
ve
only
to
kick
me
off
and
say
so
and
i
m
yours
to
well
she
can
gallop
a
bit
said
the
stranger
as
dirk
pulled
her
up
and
dismounted
but
an
ugly
brute
she
is
nevertheless
and
such
a
one
as
i
should
not
care
to
ride
for
i
am
a
gay
man
among
the
ladies
however
what
is
your
price
dirk
named
twice
as
much
as
he
would
have
taken
half
that
you
and
the
usual
haggle
began
tell
thee
what
said
dirk
at
last
i
am
a
man
who
has
his
fancies
and
this
shall
be
her
price
half
thy
bid
and
a
box
on
the
the
demon
of
covetousness
had
entered
dirk
s
heart
what
if
he
got
the
money
brained
or
at
least
disabled
the
stranger
and
so
had
a
chance
of
selling
the
mare
a
second
time
to
some
fresh
comer
thou
art
a
strange
fellow
quoth
the
but
so
be
dirk
chuckled
he
does
not
know
thought
he
that
he
has
to
do
with
dirk
hammerhand
and
he
clenched
his
fist
in
anticipation
of
his
rough
joke
there
quoth
the
stranger
counting
out
the
money
carefully
is
thy
coin
and
there
is
thy
box
on
the
and
with
a
blow
which
rattled
over
the
fen
he
felled
dirk
hammerhand
to
the
ground
he
lay
senseless
for
a
moment
and
then
looked
wildly
round
his
jaw
was
broken
villain
groaned
he
it
was
i
who
was
to
give
the
buffet
not
thou
art
mad
asked
the
stranger
as
he
coolly
picked
up
the
coins
which
dirk
had
scattered
in
his
fall
it
is
the
seller
s
business
to
take
and
the
buyer
s
to
and
while
dirk
roared
for
help
in
vain
he
leapt
on
mare

you
thought
to
knock
a

in

cursed
the
day
he
was
born
instead
of
the
mare
and
colt
he
had
got
the
two
wretched
garrons
which
the
stranger
had
left
and
a
face
which
made
him
so
tender
of
his
own
teeth
that
he
never
again
offered
to
try
a

with
a
stranger
chapter
xiv
how
hereward
rode
into
bruges
like
a
beggarman
the
spring
and
summer
had
passed
and
the
autumn
was
almost
over
when
great
news
came
to
the
court
of
bruges
where
torfrida
was
now
a
the
hollanders
had
been
beaten
till
they
submitted
at
least
for
the
present
there
was
peace
at
least
for
the
present
through
all
the
isles
of
scheldt
and
more
than
all
the
lovely
countess
gertrude
had
resolved
to
reward
her
champion
by
giving
him
her
hand
and
the
guardianship
of
her
lands
and
the
infant
son
and
hereward
from
him
or
of
him
there
was
no
word
that
he
was
alive
and
fighting
was
all
the
messenger
could
say
then
robert
came
back
to
bruges
with
a
gallant
retinue
leading
home
his
bride
and
there
met
him
his
father
and
mother
and
his
brother
of
mons
and
richilda
the
beautiful
and
terrible
sorceress
who
had
not
yet
stained
her
soul
with
those
fearful
crimes
which
she
had
expiated
by
fearful
penances
in
after
years
when
young
arnoul
the
son
for
whom
she
had
sold
her
soul
lay
dead
through
the
very
crimes
by
which
she
had
meant
to
make
him
a
mighty
prince
and
torfrida
went
out
with
them
to
meet
count
robert
and
looked
for
hereward
till
her
eyes
were
ready
to
fall
out
of
her
head
but
hereward
was
not
with
them
he
must
be
left
behind
commanding
the
army
thought
she
but
he
might
have
sent
one
word
there
was
a
great
feast
that
day
of
course
and
torfrida
sat
thereat
but
she
could
not
eat
nevertheless
she
was
too
proud
to
let
the
knights
know
what
was
in
her
heart
so
she
chatted
and
laughed
as
gayly
as
the
rest
watching
always
for
any
word
of
hereward
but
none
mentioned
his
name
the
feast
was
long
the
ladies
did
not
rise
till
nigh
bedtime
and
then
the
men
drank
on
they
went
up
to
the
s
chamber
where
a
solemn
undressing
of
that
royal
lady
usually
took
place
the
etiquette
was
this
the
sat
in
her
chair
of
state
in
the
midst
till
her
shoes
were
taken
off
and
her
hair
dressed
for
the
night
right
and
left
of
her
according
to
their
degrees
sat
the
other
great
ladies
and
behind
each
of
them
where
they
could
find
places
the
maidens
it
was
torfrida
s
turn
to
take
off
the
royal
shoes
and
she
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
semicircle
slippers
in
hand
stop
there
said
the
whereat
torfrida
stopped
very
much
frightened
countesses
and
ladies
said
the
mistress
there
are
in
provence
and
the
south
what
i
wish
there
were
here
in
flanders
courts
of
love
at
which
all
offenders
against
the
sacred
laws
of
venus
and
cupid
are
tried
by
an
assembly
of
their
peers
and
punished
according
to
their
torfrida
turned
scarlet
i
know
not
why
we
countesses
and
ladies
should
have
less
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
love
than
those
gayer
dames
of
the
south
whose
blood
runs
to
judge
by
her
dark
hair
in
the
veins
of
yon
fair
there
was
a
silence
torfrida
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
room
more
beautiful
than
even
richilda
the
terrible
and
therefore
there
were
few
but
were
glad
to
see
her
as
it
seemed
in
trouble
torfrida
s
mother
began
whimpering
and
praying
to
six
or
seven
saints
at
once
but
nobody
marked
her
possibly
not
even
the
saints
being
preoccupied
with
torfrida
i
hear
fair
maid
for
that
you
are
that
i
will
do
you
the
justice
to
confess
that
you
are
old
enough
to
be
married
this
four
years
torfrida
stood
like
a
stone
frightened
out
of
her
wits
plentiful
as
they
were
why
are
you
not
married
there
was
of
course
no
answer
i
hear
that
knights
have
fought
for
you
lost
their
lives
for
i
did
not
bid
them
gasped
torfrida
longing
that
the
floor
would
open
and
swallow
up
the
and
all
her
kin
and
followers
as
it
did
for
the
enemies
of
the
blessed
saint
dunstan
while
he
was
arguing
with
them
in
an
upper
room
at
calne
and
that
the
knight
of
valeri
to
whom
you
gave
your
favor
now
lies
languishing
of
wounds
got
in
your
i
i
did
not
bid
him
fight
gasped
torfrida
now
wishing
that
the
floor
would
open
and
swallow
up
herself
and
that
he
who
overthrew
the
knight
of
valeri
to
whom
you
gave
that
favor
and
more
i
gave
him
nothing
a
maiden
might
not
give
cried
torfrida
so
fiercely
that
the
recoiled
somewhat
i
never
said
that
you
did
girl
your
love
you
gave
him
can
you
deny
that
torfrida
laughed
bitterly
her
southern
blood
was
rising
i
put
my
love
out
to
nurse
instead
of
weaning
it
as
many
a
maiden
has
done
before
me
when
my
love
cried
for
hunger
and
cold
i
took
it
back
again
to
my
own
bosom
and
whether
it
has
lived
or
died
there
is
no
one
s
matter
but
my
hunger
and
cold
i
hear
that
him
to
whom
you
gave
your
love
you
drove
out
to
the
cold
bidding
him
go
fight
in
his
bare
shirt
if
he
wished
to
win
your
i
did
not
he
angered
me
he
and
torfrida
found
herself
in
the
act
of
accusing
hereward
she
stopped
instantly
what
more
majesty
if
this
be
true
what
more
may
not
be
true
of
such
a
one
as
i
i
submit
myself
to
your
royal
she
has
confessed
what
punishment
ladies
does
she
deserve
or
rather
what
punishment
would
her
cousins
of
provence
inflict
did
we
send
her
southward
to
be
judged
by
their
courts
of
love
one
lady
said
one
thing
one
another
some
spoke
cruelly
some
worse
than
cruelly
for
they
were
coarse
ages
the
ages
of
faith
and
ladies
said
things
then
in
open
company
which
gentlemen
would
be
ashamed
to
say
in
private
now
marry
her
to
a
fool
said
richilda
at
last
bitterly
that
is
too
common
a
misfortune
answered
the
lady
of
france
if
we
did
no
more
to
her
she
might
grow
as
proud
as
her
adela
knew
that
her
considered
her
husband
a
fool
and
was
somewhat
of
the
same
opinion
though
she
hated
richilda
no
said
she
we
will
do
more
we
will
marry
her
to
the
first
man
who
enters
the
torfrida
looked
at
her
mistress
to
see
if
she
were
mad
but
the
was
serene
and
sane
then
torfrida
s
southern
heat
and
northern
courage
burst
forth
you
marry
me
to
said
she
slowly
with
eyes
so
fierce
and
lips
so
vivid
that
richilda
herself
quailed
there
was
a
noise
of
shouting
and
laughing
in
the
court
below
which
made
all
turn
and
listen
the
next
moment
a
came
in
puzzled
and
inclined
to
laugh
may
it
please
your
majesty
here
is
the
strangest
adventure
there
is
ridden
into
the
a
with
scarce
a
shirt
to
his
back
on
a
great
ugly
mare
with
a
foal
running
by
her
and
a
fool
behind
him
carrying
lance
and
shield
and
he
says
that
he
is
come
to
fight
any
knight
of
the
court
ragged
as
he
stands
for
the
fairest
lady
in
the
court
be
she
who
she
may
if
she
have
not
a
wedded
husband
and
what
says
my
lord
marquis
that
it
is
a
fair
challenge
and
a
good
adventure
and
that
fight
he
shall
if
any
man
will
answer
his
and
i
say
tell
my
lord
the
marquis
that
fight
he
shall
not
for
he
shall
have
the
fairest
maiden
in
this
court
for
the
trouble
of
carrying
her
away
and
that
i
adela
of
france
will
give
her
to
him
so
let
that
beggar
dismount
and
be
brought
up
hither
to
there
was
silence
again
torfrida
looked
round
her
once
more
to
see
whether
or
not
she
was
dreaming
and
whether
there
was
one
human
being
to
whom
she
could
appeal
her
mother
sat
praying
and
weeping
in
a
corner
torfrida
looked
at
her
with
one
glance
of
scorn
which
she
confessed
and
repented
with
bitter
tears
many
a
year
after
in
a
foreign
land
and
then
turned
to
bay
with
the
spirit
of
her
old
paladin
ancestor
who
choked
the
emir
at
mont
majeur
married
to
a
beggar
it
was
a
strange
accident
and
an
ugly
one
and
a
great
cruelty
and
wrong
but
it
was
not
impossible
hardly
improbable
in
days
when
the
caprice
of
the
strong
created
accidents
and
when
cruelty
and
wrong
went
for
nothing
even
with
very
kindly
honest
folk
so
torfrida
faced
the
danger
as
she
would
have
faced
that
of
a
kicking
horse
or
a
flooded
ford
and
like
the
bride
she
pulled
out
a
little
penknife
that
was
both
keen
and
and
considered
that
the
could
wear
no
armor
and
that
she
wore
none
either
for
if
she
succeeded
in
slaying
that
she
might
need
to
slay
herself
after
to
avoid
being
according
to
the
fashion
of
those
days
burnt
alive
so
when
the
arras
was
drawn
back
and
that
came
into
the
room
instead
of
shrieking
fainting
hiding
or
turning
she
made
three
steps
straight
toward
him
looking
him
in
the
face
like
a
at
bay
then
she
threw
up
her
arms
and
fell
upon
his
neck
it
was
hereward
himself
filthy
ragged
but
hereward
his
shirt
was
brown
with
gore
and
torn
with
wounds
and
through
its
rents
showed
more
than
one
hardly
healed
scar
his
hair
and
beard
was
all
in
and
one
heavy
cut
across
the
head
had
shorn
not
only
hair
but
very
close
moreover
any
nose
save
that
of
love
might
have
required
perfume
but
hereward
it
was
and
regardless
of
all
beholders
she
lay
upon
his
neck
and
never
stirred
nor
spoke
i
call
you
to
witness
ladies
cried
the
that
i
am
guiltless
she
has
given
herself
to
this
of
her
own
free
will
what
say
you
and
she
turned
to
torfrida
s
mother
torfrida
s
mother
only
prayed
and
whimpered
countesses
and
ladies
said
the
there
will
be
two
weddings
the
first
will
be
that
of
my
son
robert
and
my
pretty
lady
gertrude
here
the
second
will
be
that
of
my
pretty
torfrida
and
and
the
second
bride
said
the
countess
gertrude
rising
and
taking
torfrida
in
her
arms
will
be
ten
times
prettier
than
the
first
there
sir
i
have
done
all
you
asked
of
me
now
go
and
wash
hereward
said
torfrida
a
week
after
and
did
you
really
never
change
your
shirt
all
that
time
never
i
kept
my
but
it
must
have
been
very
well
i
bathed
now
and
but
it
must
have
been
very
i
am
warm
enough
but
did
you
never
comb
your
hair
neither
well
i
won
t
say
that
travellers
find
strange
but
i
had
half
a
mind
never
to
do
it
at
all
just
to
spite
and
what
matter
would
it
have
been
to
me
o
none
it
is
only
a
danish
fashion
we
have
of
keeping
clean
you
were
dirty
enough
when
you
came
home
how
silly
you
were
if
you
had
sent
me
but
one
word
you
would
have
fancied
me
beaten
and
scolded
me
all
over
again
i
know
your
ways
now
chapter
xv
how
earl
tosti
godwinsson
came
to
omer
the
winter
passed
in
sweet
madness
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
torfrida
regretted
the
lengthening
of
the
days
and
the
flowering
of
the
primroses
and
the
return
of
the
now
needless
wryneck
for
they
warned
her
that
hereward
must
forth
again
to
the
wars
in
scaldmariland
which
had
broken
out
again
as
was
to
be
expected
as
soon
as
count
robert
and
his
bride
had
turned
their
backs
and
hereward
likewise
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
was
loath
to
go
to
war
he
was
doubtless
rich
enough
in
this
world
s
goods
torfrida
herself
was
rich
and
seems
to
have
had
the
disposal
of
her
own
property
for
her
mother
is
not
mentioned
in
connection
therewith
hereward
seems
to
have
dwelt
in
her
house
at
omer
as
long
as
he
remained
in
flanders
he
had
probably
amassed
some
treasure
of
his
own
by
the
simple
but
then
most
aristocratic
method
of
plunder
he
had
too
probably
grants
of
land
in
holland
from
the
frison
the
rents
whereof
were
not
paid
as
regularly
as
might
be
moreover
as
master
of
the
knights
he
had
it
is
likely
pay
as
well
as
honor
and
he
approved
himself
worthy
of
his
good
fortune
he
kept
forty
gallant
housecarles
in
his
hall
all
the
winter
and
torfrida
and
her
lasses
made
and
mended
their
clothes
he
gave
large
gifts
to
the
abbey
of
bertin
and
had
masses
sung
for
the
souls
of
all
whom
he
had
slain
according
to
a
rough
list
which
he
furnished
bidding
the
monks
not
to
be
chary
of
two
or
three
masses
extra
at
times
as
his
memory
was
short
and
he
might
have
sent
more
souls
to
purgatory
than
he
had
recollected
he
gave
great
alms
at
his
door
to
all
the
poor
he
befriended
especially
all
shipwrecked
and
needy
mariners
feeding
and
clothing
them
and
begging
their
freedom
as
a
gift
from
baldwin
he
feasted
the
knights
of
the
neighborhood
who
since
his
baresark
campaign
had
all
vowed
him
the
most
gallant
of
warriors
and
since
his
accession
of
wealth
the
most
courteous
of
gentlemen
and
so
all
went
merrily
as
it
is
written
as
long
as
thou
doest
well
unto
thyself
men
will
speak
well
of
so
he
would
have
fain
stayed
at
home
at
omer
but
he
was
robert
s
man
and
his
good
friend
likewise
and
to
the
wars
he
must
go
forth
once
more
and
for
eight
or
nine
weary
months
torfrida
was
alone
but
very
happy
for
a
certain
reason
of
her
own
at
last
the
short
november
days
came
round
and
a
joyful
woman
was
fair
torfrida
when
martin
lightfoot
ran
into
the
hall
and
throwing
himself
down
on
the
rushes
like
a
dog
announced
that
hereward
and
his
men
would
be
home
before
noon
and
then
fell
fast
asleep
there
was
bustling
to
and
fro
of
her
and
her
maids
decking
of
the
hall
in
the
best
hangings
strewing
of
fresh
rushes
to
the
dislodgement
of
martin
setting
out
of
square
tables
and
stoops
and
mugs
thereon
cooking
of
victuals
broaching
of
casks
and
above
all
for
hereward
s
self
heating
of
much
water
and
setting
out
in
the
inner
chamber
of
the
great
and
which
was
the
special
delight
of
a
hero
fresh
from
the
war
and
by
midday
the
streets
of
omer
rang
with
clank
and
tramp
and
and
in
marched
hereward
and
all
his
men
and
swung
round
through
the
gateway
into
the
court
where
torfrida
stood
to
welcome
them
as
fair
as
day
a
silver
in
her
hand
and
while
the
men
were
taking
off
their
harness
and
dressing
their
horses
she
and
hereward
went
in
together
and
either
took
such
joy
of
the
other
that
a
year
s
parting
was
forgot
in
a
minute
s
meeting
now
cried
she
in
a
tone
half
of
triumph
half
of
tenderness
look
there
a
cradle
and
a
baby
your
is
it
a
boy
asked
hereward
who
saw
in
his
mind
s
eye
a
thing
which
would
grow
and
broaden
at
his
knee
year
by
year
and
learn
from
him
to
ride
to
shoot
to
fight
happy
for
him
if
he
does
not
learn
worse
from
me
thought
hereward
with
a
sudden
movement
of
humility
and
contrition
which
was
surely
marked
in
heaven
for
torfrida
marked
it
on
earth
but
she
mistook
its
meaning
do
not
be
vexed
it
is
a
never
mind
as
if
it
was
a
calamity
over
which
he
was
bound
to
comfort
the
mother
if
she
is
half
as
beautiful
as
you
look
at
this
moment
what
splintering
of
lances
there
will
be
about
her
how
jolly
to
see
the
lads
hewing
at
each
other
while
our
daughter
sits
in
the
pavilion
as
queen
of
love
torfrida
laughed
you
think
of
nothing
but
fighting
bear
of
the
north
every
one
to
his
trade
well
yes
i
am
glad
that
it
is
a
i
thought
you
seemed
vexed
why
did
you
cross
yourself
because
i
thought
to
myself
how
unfit
i
was
to
bring
up
a
boy
to
be
such
a
knight
as
as
you
would
have
him
how
likely
i
was
ere
all
was
over
to
make
him
as
great
a
ruffian
as
hereward
hereward
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
for
the
tenth
time
blessed
be
you
for
those
words
those
are
the
fears
which
never
come
true
for
they
bring
down
from
heaven
the
grace
of
god
to
guard
the
humble
and
contrite
heart
from
that
which
it
ah
torfrida
i
wish
i
were
as
good
as
you
now
my
joy
and
my
life
my
hero
and
my
scald
i
have
great
news
for
you
as
well
as
a
little
baby
news
from
you
and
a
baby
over
and
above
are
worth
all
england
to
but
listen
edward
the
king
is
dead
then
there
is
one
fool
less
on
earth
and
one
saint
more
i
suppose
in
and
harold
godwinsson
is
king
in
his
stead
and
he
has
married
your
niece
aldytha
and
sworn
friendship
with
her
i
expected
no
less
well
every
dog
has
his
and
his
will
be
a
short
one
william
of
normandy
has
sworn
to
drive
him
then
he
will
do
it
and
so
the
poor
little
is
packed
into
a
convent
that
the
houses
of
godwin
and
leofric
may
rush
into
each
other
s
arms
and
perish
together
fools
fools
fools
i
will
hear
no
more
of
such
a
mad
world
my
queen
tell
me
about
your
sweet
self
what
is
all
this
to
me
am
i
not
a
wolf
s
head
and
a
landless
man
o
my
king
have
not
the
stars
told
me
that
you
will
be
an
earl
and
a
ruler
of
men
when
all
your
foes
are
wolves
heads
as
you
are
now
and
the
weird
is
coming
true
already
tosti
godwinsson
is
in
the
town
at
this
moment
an
outlaw
and
a
wolf
s
head
hereward
laughed
a
great
laugh
aha
every
man
to
his
right
place
at
last
tell
me
about
that
for
it
will
amuse
me
i
have
heard
naught
of
him
since
he
sent
the
king
his
hereford
thralls
arms
and
legs
in
the
to
show
him
he
said
that
there
was
plenty
of
cold
meat
on
his
royal
you
have
not
heard
then
how
he
murdered
in
his
own
chamber
at
york
gamel
ormsson
and
ulf
dolfinsson
that
poor
little
lad
well
a
gracious
youth
was
tosti
ever
since
he
went
to
kill
his
brother
harold
with
teeth
and
claws
like
a
wolf
and
as
he
grows
in
years
he
grows
in
grace
but
what
said
ulf
s
father
and
the
gospatricks
dolfin
and
young
gospatrick
were
i
know
not
where
but
old
gospatrick
came
down
to
westminster
to
demand
law
for
his
grandnephew
s
a
silly
thing
of
the
old
thane
to
walk
into
the
wolf
s
and
so
he
found
he
was
stabbed
there
three
days
after
and
men
say
that
queen
edith
did
it
for
love
of
tosti
her
brother
then
dolfin
and
young
gospatrick
took
to
the
sea
and
away
to
scotland
and
so
tosti
rid
himself
of
all
the
good
blood
in
the
north
except
young
waltheof
siwardsson
whose
turn
i
fear
will
come
how
comes
he
here
then
the
northern
men
rose
at
that
killed
his
servant
at
york
took
all
his
treasures
and
marched
down
to
northampton
plundering
and
burning
they
would
have
marched
on
london
town
if
harold
had
not
met
them
there
from
the
king
there
they
cried
out
against
tosti
and
all
his
taxes
and
his
murders
and
his
changing
canute
s
laws
and
would
have
young
morcar
for
their
earl
a
tyrant
they
would
not
endure
free
they
were
born
and
bred
they
said
and
free
they
would
live
and
die
harold
must
needs
do
justice
even
on
his
own
especially
when
he
knows
that
that
brother
is
his
worst
harold
is
a
better
man
than
you
take
him
for
my
hereward
but
be
that
as
it
may
morcar
is
earl
and
tosti
outlawed
and
here
in
omer
with
wife
and
my
nephew
earl
of
northumbria
as
i
might
have
been
if
i
had
been
a
wiser
if
you
had
you
would
never
have
found
true
my
queen
they
say
heaven
tempers
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
but
it
tempers
it
too
sometimes
to
the
hobbled
ass
and
so
it
has
done
by
me
and
so
the
rogues
have
fallen
out
and
honest
men
may
come
by
their
own
for
as
the
northern
men
have
done
by
one
brother
so
will
the
eastern
men
do
by
the
other
let
harold
see
how
many
of
those
fat
lincolnshire
manors
which
he
has
seized
into
his
own
hands
he
holds
by
this
day
twelve
months
but
what
is
all
this
to
me
my
queen
while
you
and
i
can
kiss
and
laugh
the
world
to
scorn
this
to
you
beloved
that
great
as
you
are
torfrida
must
have
you
greater
still
and
out
of
all
this
coil
and
confusion
you
may
win
something
if
you
be
sweet
lips
be
still
and
let
us
love
instead
of
and
this
too
you
shall
not
stop
my
mouth
that
harold
godwinsson
has
sent
a
letter
to
harold
godwinsson
is
my
very
good
lord
sneered
hereward
and
this
it
said
with
such
praises
and
courtesies
concerning
you
as
made
thy
wife
s
heart
beat
high
with
pride
if
hereward
leofricsson
will
come
home
to
england
he
shall
have
his
rights
in
law
again
and
his
manors
in
lincolnshire
and
a
in
east
anglia
and
manors
for
his
and
if
that
be
not
enough
he
shall
have
an
earldom
as
soon
as
there
is
one
to
and
what
says
to
that
torfrida
hereward
s
queen
you
will
not
be
angry
if
i
answered
the
letter
for
you
if
you
answered
it
one
way
no
if
another
torfrida
trembled
then
she
looked
hereward
full
in
the
face
with
her
keen
clear
eyes
now
shall
i
see
whether
i
have
given
myself
to
hereward
in
vain
body
and
soul
or
whether
i
have
trained
him
to
be
my
true
and
perfect
you
answered
then
said
hereward
thus
say
on
said
she
turning
her
face
away
again
hereward
leofricsson
tells
harold
godwinsson
that
he
is
his
equal
and
not
his
man
and
that
he
will
never
put
his
hands
between
the
hands
of
a
son
of
godwin
an
etheling
born
a
king
of
the
house
of
cerdic
outlawed
him
from
his
right
and
none
but
an
etheling
born
shall
give
him
his
right
i
said
it
i
said
it
those
were
my
very
words
and
torfrida
burst
into
tears
while
hereward
kissed
her
almost
fawned
upon
her
calling
her
his
queen
his
his
guardian
angel
i
was
sorely
tempted
sobbed
she
sorely
to
see
you
rich
and
proud
upon
your
own
lands
an
earl
may
be
may
be
i
thought
at
whiles
a
king
but
it
could
not
be
it
did
not
stand
with
honor
my
hero
not
with
not
with
honor
get
me
gay
garments
out
of
the
chest
and
let
us
go
in
royally
and
royally
feast
my
jolly
stay
awhile
said
she
kissing
his
head
as
she
combed
and
curled
his
long
golden
locks
and
her
own
raven
ones
hardly
more
beautiful
fell
over
them
and
mingled
with
them
stay
awhile
my
pride
there
is
another
spell
in
the
wind
stirred
up
by
devil
or
and
it
comes
from
tosti
tosti
the
butcher
what
has
he
to
say
to
me
this
if
hereward
will
come
with
me
to
william
of
normandy
and
help
us
against
harold
the
perjured
then
will
william
do
for
him
all
that
harold
would
have
done
and
more
and
what
answered
torfrida
it
was
not
so
said
to
me
that
i
could
answer
i
had
it
by
a
through
the
countess
footnote
tosti
s
wife
earl
baldwin
s
daughter
sister
of
matilda
william
the
conqueror
s
wife
and
she
had
it
from
her
sister
and
she
of
course
from
duke
william
and
what
would
you
have
answered
if
you
had
answered
pretty
one
nay
i
know
not
i
can
not
be
always
queen
you
must
be
king
torfrida
did
not
say
that
this
latter
offer
had
been
a
much
sorer
temptation
than
the
former
and
has
not
the
frenchman
enough
knights
of
his
own
that
he
needs
the
help
of
an
outlaw
like
me
he
asks
for
help
from
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
he
has
sent
that
lanfranc
to
the
pope
and
there
is
talk
of
a
sacred
banner
and
a
crusade
against
the
monks
are
with
him
then
said
hereward
that
is
one
more
count
in
their
score
but
i
am
no
monk
i
have
shorn
many
a
crown
but
i
have
kept
my
own
hair
as
yet
you
i
do
see
said
she
playing
with
his
locks
but
but
he
wants
you
he
has
sent
for
angevins
poitevins
bretons
flemings
promising
lands
rank
money
what
not
tosti
is
recruiting
for
him
here
in
flanders
now
he
will
soon
be
off
to
the
orkneys
i
suspect
or
to
sweyn
in
denmark
after
here
has
baldwin
promised
him
men
what
could
the
good
old
man
do
he
could
not
refuse
his
own
this
at
least
i
know
that
a
messenger
has
gone
off
to
scotland
to
gilbert
of
ghent
to
bring
or
send
any
bold
flemings
who
may
prefer
fat
england
to
lean
lands
rank
money
eh
so
he
intends
that
the
war
should
pay
itself
out
of
english
purses
what
answer
would
you
have
me
make
to
that
wife
mine
the
duke
is
a
terrible
man
what
if
he
conquers
and
conquer
he
is
that
written
in
your
stars
it
is
i
fear
and
if
he
have
the
pope
s
blessing
and
the
pope
s
banner
dare
we
resist
the
holy
father
holy
you
mean
for
a
he
seems
to
prove
to
merry
england
but
do
you
really
believe
that
an
old
man
down
in
italy
can
make
a
bit
of
rag
conquer
by
saying
a
few
prayers
at
it
if
i
am
to
believe
in
a
magic
flag
give
me
harold
hardraade
s
landcyda
at
least
with
harold
and
his
norsemen
behind
william
s
french
are
as
good
as
those
norsemen
man
for
man
and
horsed
withal
that
may
be
said
he
half
testily
with
a
curse
on
the
tanner
s
grandson
and
his
french
popinjays
and
our
englishmen
are
as
good
as
any
two
norsemen
as
the
norse
themselves
he
could
not
divine
and
torfrida
hardly
liked
to
explain
to
him
the
glamour
which
the
duke
of
normandy
had
cast
over
her
as
the
representative
of
chivalry
learning
civilization
a
new
and
nobler
life
for
men
than
the
world
had
yet
seen
one
which
seemed
to
connect
the
young
races
of
europe
with
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
and
the
magic
glories
of
old
imperial
rome
you
are
not
fair
to
that
man
said
she
after
a
while
hereward
hereward
have
i
not
told
you
how
though
body
be
strong
mind
is
stronger
that
is
what
that
man
knows
and
therefore
he
has
prospered
therefore
his
realms
are
full
of
wise
scholars
and
thriving
schools
and
fair
minsters
and
his
men
are
sober
and
wise
and
learned
like
clerks
and
false
like
clerks
as
he
is
himself
schoolcraft
and
honesty
never
went
yet
together
torfrida
not
in
me
you
are
not
a
clerk
you
are
a
woman
and
more
you
are
an
elf
a
goddess
there
is
none
like
you
but
hearken
to
me
this
man
is
false
all
the
world
knows
he
promises
they
say
to
govern
england
justly
as
king
edward
s
heir
according
to
the
old
laws
and
liberties
of
the
of
course
if
he
does
not
come
as
the
old
monk
s
heir
how
does
he
come
at
all
if
he
does
not
promise
our
their
i
mean
for
i
am
no
englishman
laws
and
liberties
who
will
join
him
but
his
riders
and
hirelings
will
not
fight
for
nothing
they
must
be
paid
with
english
land
and
english
land
they
will
have
for
they
will
be
his
men
whoever
else
are
not
they
will
be
his
darlings
his
housecarles
his
hawks
to
sit
on
his
fist
and
fly
at
his
game
and
english
bones
will
be
picked
clean
to
feed
them
and
you
would
have
me
help
to
do
that
torfrida
is
that
the
honor
of
which
you
spoke
so
boldly
to
harold
godwinsson
torfrida
was
silent
to
have
brought
hereward
under
the
influence
of
william
was
an
old
dream
of
hers
and
yet
she
was
proud
at
the
dream
being
broken
thus
and
so
she
said
you
are
right
it
is
better
for
you
it
is
better
than
to
be
william
s
darling
and
the
greatest
earl
in
his
court
to
feel
that
you
are
still
an
englishman
promise
me
but
one
thing
that
you
will
make
no
fierce
or
desperate
answer
to
the
and
why
not
answer
the
tanner
as
he
deserves
because
my
art
and
my
heart
too
tells
me
that
your
fortunes
and
his
are
linked
together
i
have
studied
my
tables
but
they
would
not
answer
then
i
cast
lots
in
virgilius
and
what
found
you
there
asked
he
anxiously
i
opened
at
the
lines
pacem
me
exanimis
et
martis
sorte
peremptis
oratis
equidem
et
vivis
concedere
and
what
means
that
that
you
may
have
to
pray
him
to
pity
the
slain
and
have
for
answer
that
their
lands
may
be
yours
if
you
will
but
make
peace
with
him
at
least
do
not
break
hopelessly
with
that
man
above
all
never
use
that
word
concerning
him
which
you
used
just
now
the
word
which
he
never
forgives
remember
what
he
did
to
them
of
alençon
when
they
hung
raw
hides
over
the
wall
and
cried
plenty
of
work
for
the
tanner
let
him
pick
out
the
prisoners
eyes
and
chop
off
their
hands
and
shoot
them
into
the
town
from
mangonels
he
must
go
far
and
thrive
well
ere
i
give
him
a
chance
of
doing
that
by
hereward
hereward
my
own
boast
not
but
fear
god
who
knows
in
such
a
world
as
this
to
what
end
we
may
come
night
after
night
i
am
haunted
with
spectres
eyeless
handless
this
is
cold
comfort
for
a
man
just
out
of
hard
fighting
in
the
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
held
him
as
if
she
would
never
let
him
go
when
you
die
i
die
and
you
will
not
die
you
will
be
great
and
glorious
and
your
name
will
be
sung
by
scald
and
minstrel
through
many
a
land
far
and
wide
only
be
not
rash
be
not
promise
me
to
answer
this
man
wisely
the
more
crafty
he
is
the
more
crafty
must
you
be
let
us
tell
this
mighty
hero
then
said
hereward
trying
to
laugh
away
her
fears
and
perhaps
his
own
that
while
he
has
the
holy
father
on
his
side
he
can
need
no
help
from
a
poor
sinful
worm
like
hereward
hereward
why
is
there
aught
about
hides
in
that
i
want
i
want
an
answer
which
may
not
cut
off
all
hope
in
case
of
the
then
let
us
say
boldly
on
the
day
that
william
is
king
of
all
england
hereward
will
come
and
put
his
hands
between
his
and
be
his
that
message
was
sent
to
william
at
rouen
he
laughed
it
is
a
fair
challenge
from
a
valiant
man
the
day
shall
come
when
i
will
claim
tosti
and
hereward
passed
that
winter
in
omer
living
in
the
same
street
passing
each
other
day
by
day
and
never
spoke
a
word
one
to
the
other
robert
the
frison
heard
of
it
and
tried
to
persuade
hereward
let
him
purge
himself
of
the
murder
of
ulf
the
boy
son
of
my
friend
dolfin
and
after
that
of
gamel
son
of
orm
and
after
that
again
of
gospatrick
my
father
s
friend
whom
his
sister
slew
for
his
sake
and
then
an
honest
man
may
talk
with
him
were
he
not
my
good
lord
s
as
he
is
more
s
the
pity
i
would
challenge
him
to
fight
l
with
any
weapons
he
might
heaven
protect
him
in
that
case
quoth
robert
the
frison
as
it
is
i
will
keep
the
peace
and
i
will
see
that
my
men
keep
the
peace
though
there
are
scarborough
and
bamborough
lads
among
them
who
long
to
cut
his
throat
upon
the
streets
but
more
i
will
not
so
tosti
sulked
through
the
winter
at
omer
and
then
went
off
to
get
help
from
sweyn
of
denmark
and
failing
that
from
harold
hardraade
of
norway
but
how
he
sped
there
must
be
read
in
the
words
of
a
cunninger
than
this
chronicler
even
in
those
of
the
icelandic
homer
snorro
sturleson
chapter
xvi
how
hereward
was
asked
to
slay
an
old
comrade
in
those
days
hereward
went
into
bruges
to
marquis
baldwin
about
his
business
and
as
he
walked
in
bruges
street
he
met
an
old
friend
gilbert
of
ghent
he
had
grown
somewhat
stouter
and
somewhat
grayer
in
the
last
ten
years
but
he
was
as
hearty
as
ever
and
as
honest
according
to
his
own
notions
of
honesty
he
shook
hereward
by
both
hands
clapt
him
on
the
back
swore
with
many
oaths
that
he
had
heard
of
his
fame
in
all
lands
that
he
always
said
that
he
would
turn
out
a
champion
and
a
gallant
knight
and
had
said
it
long
before
he
killed
the
bear
as
for
killing
it
it
was
no
more
than
he
expected
and
nothing
to
what
hereward
had
done
since
and
would
do
yet
wherefrom
hereward
opined
that
gilbert
had
need
of
him
they
chatted
on
hereward
asking
after
old
friends
and
sometimes
after
old
foes
whom
he
had
long
since
forgiven
for
though
he
always
avenged
an
injury
he
never
bore
malice
for
one
a
distinction
less
common
now
than
then
when
a
man
s
honor
as
well
as
his
safety
depended
on
his
striking
again
when
he
was
struck
and
how
is
little
alftruda
big
she
must
be
now
asked
he
at
last
the
fiend
fly
away
with
her
or
rather
would
that
he
had
flown
away
with
her
before
ever
i
saw
the
troublesome
little
jade
big
she
is
grown
into
the
most
beautiful
lass
that
ever
was
seen
which
is
what
a
young
fellow
like
you
cares
for
and
more
trouble
to
me
than
all
my
money
which
is
what
an
old
fellow
like
me
cares
for
it
is
partly
about
her
that
i
am
over
here
now
fool
that
i
was
ever
to
let
an
etheliza
footnote
a
princess
of
the
royal
blood
of
cerdic
and
therefore
of
edward
the
confessor
into
my
house
and
gilbert
swore
a
great
deal
how
was
she
an
etheliza
asked
hereward
who
cared
nothing
about
the
matter
and
how
came
she
into
your
house
i
never
could
understand
that
any
more
than
how
the
bear
came
ah
as
to
the
bear
i
have
my
secrets
which
i
tell
no
one
he
is
dead
and
buried
thanks
to
and
i
sleep
on
his
skin
every
you
do
my
little
champion
well
warm
is
the
bed
that
is
well
earned
but
as
for
her
see
here
and
i
ll
tell
you
she
was
gospatrick
s
ward
and
kinswoman
how
i
do
not
rightly
know
but
this
i
know
that
she
comes
from
uchtred
the
earl
whom
canute
slew
and
that
she
is
heir
to
great
estates
in
northumberland
gospatrick
that
fought
at
dunsinane
yes
not
the
old
thane
his
uncle
whom
tosti
has
murdered
but
gospatrick
king
malcolm
s
cousin
dolfin
s
father
well
she
was
his
ward
he
gave
me
her
to
keep
for
he
wanted
her
out
of
harm
s
way
the
lass
having
a
bonny
dower
lands
and
money
till
he
could
marry
her
up
to
one
of
his
sons
i
took
her
of
course
i
was
not
going
to
do
other
men
s
work
for
naught
so
i
would
have
married
her
up
to
my
poor
boy
if
he
had
but
lived
but
he
would
not
live
as
you
know
then
i
would
have
married
her
to
you
and
made
you
my
heir
i
tell
you
honestly
if
you
had
not
flown
off
like
a
young
springald
as
you
were
you
were
very
kind
but
how
is
she
an
etheliza
etheliza
twice
over
her
father
was
of
high
blood
among
those
saxons
and
if
not
are
not
all
the
gospatricks
ethelings
their
grandmother
uchtred
s
wife
was
ethelred
s
daughter
king
edward
of
london
s
sister
and
i
have
heard
that
this
girl
s
grandfather
was
their
son
but
died
young
or
was
killed
with
his
father
who
cares
not
i
quoth
hereward
well
he
wants
to
marry
her
to
dolfin
his
eldest
why
dolfin
had
a
wife
when
i
was
at
but
she
is
dead
since
and
young
ulf
her
son
murdered
by
tosti
last
i
whereon
gospatrick
sends
to
me
for
the
girl
and
her
dowry
what
was
i
to
do
give
her
up
little
it
is
lad
that
i
ever
gave
up
after
i
had
it
once
in
my
grip
or
i
should
be
a
poorer
man
than
i
am
now
have
and
hold
is
my
rule
what
should
i
do
what
i
did
i
was
coming
hither
on
business
of
my
own
so
i
put
her
on
board
ship
and
half
her
dower
where
the
other
half
is
i
know
and
man
must
draw
me
with
wild
horses
before
he
finds
out
and
came
here
to
my
kinsman
baldwin
to
see
if
he
had
any
proper
young
fellow
to
whom
we
might
marry
the
lass
and
so
go
shares
in
her
money
and
the
family
connection
could
a
man
do
more
wisely
impossible
quoth
hereward
but
see
how
a
wise
man
is
lost
by
fortune
when
i
come
here
whom
should
i
find
but
dolfin
himself
the
dog
had
scent
of
my
plan
all
the
way
from
dolfinston
there
by
peebles
he
hunts
me
out
the
hungry
scotch
wolf
rides
for
leith
takes
ship
and
is
here
to
meet
me
having
accused
me
before
baldwin
as
a
robber
and
ravisher
and
offers
to
prove
his
right
to
the
jade
on
my
body
in
single
the
villain
quoth
hereward
there
is
no
modesty
left
on
earth
nor
prudence
either
to
come
here
where
he
might
have
stumbled
on
tosti
who
murdered
his
son
and
i
would
surely
do
the
like
by
him
himself
lucky
for
him
that
tosti
is
off
to
norway
on
his
own
modesty
and
prudence
none
young
sire
nor
justice
either
i
think
for
when
baldwin
hears
us
both
and
i
told
my
story
as
cannily
as
i
could
he
tells
me
that
he
is
very
sorry
for
an
old
vassal
and
kinsman
and
so
forth
but
i
must
either
disgorge
or
then
fight
quoth
hereward
per
se
aut
per
campioneem
that
s
the
old
law
you
not
a
doubt
of
look
you
hereward
i
am
no
coward
nor
a
clumsy
man
of
my
he
is
either
fool
or
liar
who
says
but
see
i
find
it
hard
work
to
hold
my
own
in
scotland
now
folks
don
t
like
me
or
trust
me
i
can
t
say
how
unreasonable
quoth
hereward
and
if
i
kill
this
youth
and
so
have
a
with
gospatrick
i
have
a
hornet
s
nest
about
my
ears
not
only
he
and
his
sons
who
are
masters
of
scotch
northumberland
footnote
between
tweed
and
forth
but
all
his
cousins
king
malcolm
and
donaldbain
and
for
aught
i
know
harold
and
the
godwinssons
if
he
bid
them
take
up
the
quarrel
and
beside
that
dolfin
is
a
big
man
if
you
cross
scot
and
saxon
you
breed
a
very
big
man
if
you
cross
again
with
a
dane
or
a
norseman
you
breed
a
giant
his
grandfather
was
a
scots
prince
his
grandmother
an
english
etheliza
his
mother
a
norse
princess
as
you
know
and
how
big
he
is
you
should
remember
he
weighs
half
as
much
again
as
i
and
twice
as
much
as
butchers
count
by
weight
and
knights
by
courage
quoth
hereward
very
well
for
you
who
are
young
and
active
but
i
take
him
to
be
a
better
man
than
that
ogre
of
cornwall
whom
they
say
you
what
care
i
let
him
be
twice
as
good
i
d
try
ah
i
knew
you
were
the
old
hereward
still
now
hearken
to
me
be
my
champion
you
owe
me
a
service
lad
fight
that
man
challenge
him
in
open
field
kill
him
as
you
are
sure
to
do
claim
the
lass
and
win
her
and
then
we
will
part
her
dower
and
though
it
is
little
that
i
care
for
young
lasses
fancies
to
tell
you
truth
she
never
favored
any
man
but
hereward
started
at
the
snare
which
had
been
laid
for
him
and
then
fell
into
a
very
great
laughter
my
most
dear
and
generous
host
you
are
the
wiser
the
older
you
grow
a
plan
worthy
of
solomon
you
are
rid
of
sieur
dolfin
without
any
blame
to
just
while
i
win
the
lass
and
living
here
in
flanders
am
tolerably
safe
from
any
of
the
just
perfect
but
there
is
only
one
small
hindrance
to
the
plan
and
that
is
that
i
am
married
gilbert
stopped
short
and
swore
a
great
oath
but
he
said
after
a
while
does
that
matter
so
much
after
all
very
little
indeed
as
all
the
world
knows
if
one
has
money
enough
and
power
and
you
have
both
they
say
but
still
more
unhappily
my
money
is
my
wife
peste
and
more
unhappily
still
i
am
so
foolishly
fond
of
her
that
i
would
sooner
have
her
in
her
smock
than
any
other
woman
with
half
england
for
a
then
i
suppose
i
must
look
out
for
another
or
save
yourself
the
trouble
by
being
just
as
a
change
an
honest
i
believe
you
are
right
said
gilbert
laughing
but
it
is
hard
to
begin
so
late
in
and
after
one
has
had
so
little
aha
thou
art
the
same
merry
dog
of
a
hereward
come
along
but
could
we
not
poison
this
dolfin
after
all
to
which
proposal
hereward
gave
no
encouragement
and
now
my
très
beausire
may
i
ask
you
in
return
what
business
brings
you
to
flanders
have
i
not
told
you
no
but
i
have
guessed
gilbert
of
ghent
is
on
his
way
to
william
of
well
why
not
why
not
certainly
and
has
brought
out
of
scotland
a
few
gallant
gentlemen
and
stout
housecarles
of
my
gilbert
laughed
you
may
well
say
that
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
have
flitted
bag
and
baggage
i
don
t
believe
that
we
have
left
a
dog
so
you
intend
to
colonize
in
england
as
the
learned
clerks
would
call
it
to
settle
to
own
land
and
enter
like
the
jews
of
old
into
goodly
houses
which
you
builded
not
farms
which
you
tilled
not
wells
which
you
digged
not
and
orchards
which
you
planted
not
why
what
a
clerk
you
are
that
sounds
like
and
so
it
is
i
heard
it
in
a
french
priest
s
sermon
which
he
preached
here
in
omer
a
sunday
or
two
back
exhorting
all
good
catholics
in
the
pope
s
name
to
enter
upon
the
barbarous
land
of
england
tainted
with
the
sin
of
simon
magus
and
expel
thence
the
heretical
priests
and
so
forth
promising
them
that
they
should
have
free
leave
to
cut
long
thongs
out
of
other
men
s
gilbert
chuckled
you
laugh
the
priest
did
not
for
after
sermon
i
went
up
to
him
and
told
him
how
i
was
an
englishman
and
an
outlaw
and
a
desperate
man
who
feared
neither
saint
nor
devil
and
if
i
heard
such
talk
as
that
again
in
omer
i
would
so
shave
the
speaker
s
crown
that
he
should
never
need
razor
to
his
dying
and
what
is
that
to
me
said
gilbert
in
an
uneasy
tone
for
hereward
s
tone
had
been
more
than
this
that
there
are
certain
broad
lands
in
england
which
were
my
father
s
and
are
now
my
nephews
and
my
mother
s
and
some
which
should
by
right
be
mine
and
i
advise
you
as
a
friend
not
to
make
entry
on
those
lands
lest
hereward
in
turn
make
entry
on
you
and
who
is
he
that
will
deliver
you
out
of
my
hand
god
and
his
saints
alone
thou
fiend
out
of
the
pit
quoth
gilbert
laughing
but
he
was
growing
warm
and
began
to
tutoyer
hereward
i
am
in
earnest
gilbert
of
ghent
my
good
friend
of
old
i
know
thee
well
enough
man
why
in
the
name
of
all
glory
and
plunder
art
thou
not
coming
with
us
they
say
william
has
offered
thee
the
earldom
of
he
has
not
and
if
he
has
it
is
not
his
to
give
and
if
it
were
it
is
by
right
neither
mine
nor
my
nephews
but
waltheof
siwardsson
s
now
hearken
unto
me
and
settle
it
in
your
mind
thou
and
william
both
that
your
quarrel
is
against
none
but
harold
and
the
godwinssons
and
their
men
of
wessex
but
that
if
you
go
to
cross
the
watling
street
and
meddle
with
the
free
danes
who
are
none
of
harold
s
men
stay
harold
has
large
manors
in
lincolnshire
and
so
has
edith
his
sister
and
what
of
them
sir
hereward
that
the
man
who
touches
them
even
though
the
men
on
them
may
fight
on
harold
s
side
had
better
have
put
his
head
into
a
hornet
s
nest
unjustly
were
they
seized
from
their
true
owners
by
harold
and
his
fathers
and
the
holders
of
them
will
owe
no
service
to
him
a
day
longer
than
they
can
help
but
will
if
he
fall
demand
an
earl
of
their
own
race
or
fight
to
the
best
make
young
waltheof
earl
best
keep
thy
foot
out
of
them
and
the
foot
of
any
man
for
whom
thou
carest
now
good
by
friends
we
are
and
friends
let
us
ah
that
thou
wert
coming
to
england
i
bide
my
time
come
i
may
when
i
see
fit
but
whether
i
come
as
friend
or
foe
depends
on
that
of
which
i
have
given
thee
fair
so
they
parted
for
the
time
it
will
be
seen
hereafter
how
gilbert
took
his
own
advice
about
young
waltheof
but
did
not
take
hereward
s
advice
about
the
lincoln
manors
in
baldwin
s
hall
that
day
hereward
met
dolfin
and
when
the
magnificent
young
scot
sprang
to
him
embraced
him
talked
over
old
passages
complimented
him
on
his
fame
lamented
that
he
himself
had
won
no
such
honors
in
the
field
hereward
felt
much
more
inclined
to
fight
for
him
than
against
him
presently
the
ladies
entered
from
the
bower
inside
the
hall
a
buzz
of
expectation
rose
from
all
the
knights
and
alftruda
s
name
was
whispered
round
she
came
in
and
hereward
saw
at
the
first
glance
that
gilbert
had
for
once
in
his
life
spoken
truth
so
beautiful
a
girl
he
had
never
beheld
and
as
she
swept
down
toward
him
he
for
one
moment
forgot
torfrida
and
stood
like
the
rest
her
eye
caught
his
if
his
face
showed
recognition
hers
showed
none
the
remembrance
of
their
early
friendship
of
her
deliverance
from
the
monster
had
plainly
passed
away
fickle
ungrateful
things
these
women
thought
hereward
she
passed
him
close
and
as
she
did
so
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
one
moment
haughty
and
cold
so
you
could
not
wait
for
me
said
she
in
a
quiet
whisper
and
went
on
straight
to
dolfin
who
stood
trembling
with
expectation
and
delight
she
put
her
hand
into
his
here
stands
my
champion
said
she
say
here
kneels
your
slave
cried
the
scot
dropping
to
the
pavement
a
true
highland
knee
whereon
forth
shrieked
a
bagpipe
and
dolfin
s
minstrel
sang
in
most
melodious
gaelic
strong
as
a
horse
s
hock
shaggy
as
a
stag
s
brisket
is
the
knee
of
the
young
the
pride
of
the
house
of
crinan
it
bent
not
to
macbeth
the
accursed
it
bends
not
even
to
malcolm
the
anointed
but
it
bends
like
a
harebell
who
shall
blame
it
before
the
breath
of
which
magnificent
effusion
being
interpreted
by
hereward
for
the
instruction
of
the
ladies
procured
for
the
bard
more
than
one
handsome
gift
a
sturdy
voice
arose
out
of
the
crowd
the
fair
lady
my
lord
count
and
knights
all
will
need
no
champion
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
when
one
sees
so
fair
a
pair
together
what
can
a
knight
say
in
the
name
of
all
knighthood
but
that
the
heavens
have
made
them
for
each
other
and
that
it
were
sin
and
shame
to
sunder
them
the
voice
was
that
of
gilbert
of
ghent
who
making
a
virtue
of
necessity
walked
up
to
the
pair
his
countenance
wreathed
into
what
were
meant
for
paternal
smiles
why
did
you
not
say
as
much
in
scotland
and
save
me
all
this
trouble
pertinently
asked
the
scot
my
lord
prince
you
owe
me
a
debt
for
my
caution
without
it
the
poor
lady
had
never
known
the
whole
fervency
of
your
love
or
these
noble
knights
and
yourself
the
whole
evenness
of
count
baldwin
s
alftruda
turned
her
head
away
half
contemptuously
and
as
she
did
so
she
let
her
hand
drop
listlessly
from
dolfin
s
grasp
and
drew
back
to
the
other
ladies
a
suspicion
crossed
hereward
s
mind
did
she
really
love
the
prince
did
those
strange
words
of
hers
mean
that
she
had
not
yet
forgotten
hereward
himself
however
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
no
concern
of
his
as
it
certainly
was
not
went
home
to
torfrida
told
her
everything
that
had
happened
laughed
over
it
with
her
and
then
forgot
alftruda
dolfin
and
gilbert
in
the
prospect
of
a
great
campaign
in
holland
chapter
xvii
how
hereward
took
the
news
from
stanford
brigg
and
hastings
after
that
news
came
thick
and
fast
news
of
all
the
fowl
of
heaven
flocking
to
the
feast
of
the
great
god
that
they
might
eat
the
flesh
of
kings
and
captains
and
mighty
men
and
horses
and
them
that
sit
on
them
and
the
flesh
of
all
men
both
bond
and
free
news
from
rome
how
england
when
conquered
was
to
be
held
as
a
fief
of
peter
and
spiritually
as
well
as
temporarily
enslaved
news
how
the
gonfanon
of
peter
and
a
ring
with
a
bit
of
peter
himself
enclosed
therein
had
come
to
rouen
to
go
before
the
norman
host
as
the
ark
went
before
that
of
israel
then
news
from
the
north
how
tosti
had
been
to
sweyn
and
bid
him
come
back
and
win
the
country
again
as
canute
his
uncle
had
done
and
how
the
cautious
dane
had
answered
that
he
was
a
much
smaller
man
than
canute
and
had
enough
to
hold
his
own
against
the
norsemen
and
could
not
afford
to
throw
for
such
high
stakes
as
his
mighty
uncle
then
how
tosti
had
been
to
norway
to
harold
hardraade
and
asked
him
why
he
had
been
fighting
fifteen
years
for
denmark
when
england
lay
open
to
him
and
how
harold
of
norway
had
agreed
to
come
and
how
he
had
levied
one
half
of
the
men
in
norway
and
how
he
was
gathering
a
mighty
fleet
at
solundir
in
the
mouth
of
the
sogne
fiord
of
all
this
hereward
was
well
informed
for
tosti
came
back
again
to
omer
and
talked
big
but
hereward
and
he
had
no
dealings
with
each
other
but
at
last
when
tosti
tried
to
entice
some
of
hereward
s
men
to
sail
with
him
hereward
sent
him
word
that
if
he
met
him
he
would
kill
him
in
the
streets
then
tosti
who
though
he
wanted
not
for
courage
knew
that
he
was
no
match
for
hereward
went
off
to
bruges
leaving
his
wife
and
family
behind
gathered
sixty
ships
at
ostend
went
off
to
the
isle
of
wight
and
forced
the
landsfolk
to
give
him
money
and
food
and
then
harold
of
england
s
fleet
which
was
watching
the
coast
against
the
normans
drove
him
away
and
he
sailed
off
north
full
of
black
rage
against
his
brother
harold
and
all
englishmen
and
burned
plundered
and
murdered
along
the
coast
of
lincolnshire
out
of
brute
spite
to
the
danes
who
had
expelled
him
then
came
news
how
he
had
got
into
the
humber
how
earl
edwin
and
his
northumbrians
had
driven
him
out
and
how
he
went
off
to
scotland
to
meet
harold
of
norway
and
how
he
had
put
his
hands
between
harold
s
and
become
his
man
and
all
the
while
the
norman
camp
at
grew
and
grew
and
all
was
ready
if
the
wind
would
but
change
and
so
hereward
looked
on
helpless
and
saw
these
two
great
growing
one
from
north
and
one
from
south
to
burst
upon
his
native
land
two
invasions
at
the
same
moment
of
time
and
these
no
mere
viking
raids
for
plunder
but
deliberate
attempts
at
conquest
and
colonization
by
the
two
most
famous
captains
of
the
age
what
if
both
succeeded
what
if
the
two
swept
across
england
each
on
its
own
path
and
met
in
the
midst
to
hurl
their
lightnings
into
each
other
a
fight
between
william
of
normandy
and
harold
of
norway
on
some
moorland
in
mercia
it
would
be
a
battle
of
giants
a
sight
at
which
odin
and
the
gods
of
valhalla
would
rise
from
their
seats
and
throw
away
the
to
stare
down
on
the
deeds
of
heroes
scarcely
less
mighty
than
themselves
would
that
neither
might
win
would
that
they
would
destroy
and
devour
till
there
was
none
left
of
frenchmen
or
of
norwegians
so
sang
hereward
after
his
heathen
fashion
and
his
housecarles
applauded
the
song
but
torfrida
shuddered
and
what
will
become
of
the
poor
english
in
the
mean
time
they
have
brought
it
on
themselves
said
hereward
bitterly
instead
of
giving
the
crown
to
the
man
who
should
have
had
it
to
sweyn
of
denmark
they
let
godwin
put
it
on
the
head
of
a
drivelling
monk
and
as
they
sowed
so
will
they
but
hereward
s
own
soul
was
black
within
him
to
see
these
mighty
events
passing
as
it
were
within
reach
of
his
hand
and
he
unable
to
take
his
share
in
them
for
what
share
could
he
take
that
of
tosti
godwinsson
against
his
own
nephews
that
of
harold
godwinsson
the
usurper
that
of
the
tanner
s
grandson
against
any
man
ah
that
he
had
been
in
england
ah
that
he
had
been
where
he
might
have
been
where
he
ought
to
have
been
but
for
his
own
folly
high
in
power
in
his
native
land
perhaps
a
great
earl
perhaps
commander
of
all
the
armies
of
the
danelagh
and
bitterly
he
cursed
his
youthful
sins
as
he
rode
to
and
fro
almost
daily
to
the
port
of
calais
asking
for
news
and
getting
often
only
too
much
for
now
came
news
that
the
norsemen
had
landed
in
humber
that
edwin
and
morcar
were
beaten
at
york
that
hardraade
and
tosti
were
masters
of
the
north
and
with
that
news
that
by
the
virtue
of
the
relics
of
valeri
which
had
been
brought
out
of
their
shrine
to
frighten
the
demons
of
the
storm
and
by
the
intercession
of
the
blessed
michael
patron
of
normandy
the
winds
had
changed
and
william
s
whole
armament
had
crossed
the
channel
landed
upon
an
undefended
shore
and
fortified
themselves
at
pevensey
and
hastings
and
then
followed
a
fortnight
of
silence
and
torturing
suspense
hereward
could
hardly
eat
drink
sleep
or
speak
he
answered
torfrida
s
consolations
curtly
and
angrily
till
she
betook
herself
to
silent
caresses
as
to
a
sick
animal
but
she
loved
him
all
the
better
for
his
sullenness
for
it
showed
that
his
english
heart
was
wakening
again
sound
and
strong
at
last
news
came
he
was
down
as
usual
at
the
port
a
ship
had
just
come
in
from
the
northward
a
man
just
landed
stood
on
the
beach
gesticulating
and
calling
in
an
unknown
tongue
to
the
bystanders
who
laughed
at
him
and
seemed
inclined
to
misuse
him
hereward
galloped
down
the
beach
out
of
the
way

one

have
been
proud

dream
said
thord
turning
from
martin
angrily
he
was
standing
in
the
king
s
ship
and
he
saw
a
great
witchwife
with
a
fork
and
a
trough
stand
on
the
island
and
he
saw
a
fowl
on
every
ship
s
stem
a
raven
or
else
an
eagle
and
he
heard
the
witchwife
sing
an
evil
by
this
time
they
were
in
omer
hereward
rode
straight
to
the
countess
judith
s
house
he
never
had
entered
it
yet
and
was
likely
to
be
attacked
if
he
entered
it
now
but
when
the
door
was
opened
he
thrust
in
with
so
earnest
and
sad
a
face
that
the
servants
let
him
pass
but
not
without
growling
and
motions
as
of
getting
their
weapons
i
come
in
peace
my
men
i
come
in
peace
this

ladies

her
madam
that
hereward
waits
her
commands
and

and
all
saints
to
vouchsafe
him
one
word
in
the
lady
hurried
into
the
bower
the
next
moment
judith
hurried
out
into
the
hall
her
fair
face
blanched
her
fair
eyes
wide
with
terror
hereward
fell
on
his
knee
what
is
this
it
must
be
bad
news
if
you
bring
madam
the
grave
covers
all
feuds
earl

valiant
hero

she
did
not
hear
the
end
of
the
sentence
but
fell
back
with
a
shriek
into
the
women
s
arms
hereward
told
them
all
that
they
needed
to
know
of
that
fratricidal
strife
and

the
marshal
took
this
off
his
neck
and
bade
me
give
it
to
none
but
his
lady
therefore
with
your
pardon
sir
earl
i
did
not
tell
you
that
i
had
it
not
knowing
whether
you
were
an
honest
thou
hast
done
well
and
an
honest
man
thou
shall
find
me
come
home
and
i
will
feed
thee
at
my
own
table
for
i
have
been
a
and
a
viking
they
left
the
reliquary
with
the
ladies
and
went
see
to
this
good
man
that
will
i
as
the
apple
of
my
and
hereward
went
into
torfrida
s
room
i
have
news
news
so
have
harold
hardraade
is
slain
and
tosti
too
where
how
harold
godwinsson
slew
them
by
brother
has
slain
brother
o
god
that
died
on
cross
murmured
torfrida
when
will
men
look
to
thee
and
have
mercy
on
their
own
souls
but
hereward
i
have
news
news
more
terrible
by
far
it
came
an
hour
ago
i
have
been
dreading
your
coming
say
on
if
harold
hardraade
is
dead
no
worse
can
but
harold
godwinsson
is
dead
dead
who
next
william
of
normandy
the
world
seems
coming
to
an
end
as
the
monks
say
it
will
footnote
there
was
a
general
rumor
abroad
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
that
the
one
thousand
years
of
prophecy
had
expired
a
great
battle
has
been
fought
at
a
place
they
call
close
by
hastings
close
to
the
harold
must
have
flown
thither
back
from
york
what
a
captain
the
man
is
after
was
he
is
dead
and
all
the
godwinssons
and
england
if
torfrida
had
feared
the
effect
of
her
news
her
heart
was
lightened
at
once
as
hereward
answered
haughtily
england
lost
sussex
is
not
england
nor
wessex
either
any
more
than
harold
was
king
thereof
england
lost
let
the
tanner
try
to
cross
the
watling
street
and
he
will
find
out
that
he
has
another
stamp
of
englishmen
to
deal
hereward
hereward
do
not
be
unjust
to
the
dead
men
say
the
normans
say
that
they
fought
like
i
never
doubted
that
but
it
makes
me
mad
as
it
does
all
eastern
and
northern
men
to
hear
these
wessex
churls
and
godwinssons
calling
themselves
all
torfrida
shook
her
head
to
her
as
to
most
foreigners
wessex
and
the
southeast
counties
were
england
the
most
civilized
the
most
norman
the
seat
of
royalty
having
all
the
prestige
of
law
and
order
and
wealth
and
she
was
shrewd
enough
to
see
that
as
it
was
the
part
of
england
which
had
most
sympathy
with
norman
civilization
it
was
the
very
part
where
the
norman
could
most
easily
gain
and
keep
his
hold
the
event
proved
that
torfrida
was
right
but
all
she
said
was
it
is
dangerously
near
to
france
at
it
is
that
i
would
sooner
see
french
north
of
the
humber
than
in
kent
and
sussex
where
he
can
hurry
over
supplies
and
men
every
week
it
is
the
for
him
if
he
means
to
conquer
england
and
he
and
he
shall
not
and
hereward
started
up
and
walked
to
and
fro
if
all
the
godwinssons
be
dead
there
are
leofricssons
left
i
trust
and
siward
s
kin
and
the
gospatricks
in
northumbria
ah
where
were
my
nephews
in
the
battle
not
killed
too
i
trust
they
were
not
in
the
not
with
their
new
much
he
has
gained
by
throwing
away
the
like
a
base
hound
as
he
was
and
marrying
my
pretty
niece
but
where
were
they
no
man
knows
clearly
they
followed
him
down
as
far
as
london
and
then
lingered
about
the
city
meaning
no
man
can
tell
what
but
we
shall
hear
and
i
fear
hear
too
much
before
a
week
is
heavens
this
is
madness
indeed
this
is
the
way
to
be
eaten
up
one
by
one
neither
to
do
the
thing
nor
leave
it
alone
if
i
had
been
there
if
i
had
been
there
you
would
have
saved
england
my
hero
and
torfrida
believed
her
own
words
i
don
t
say
that
besides
i
say
that
england
is
not
lost
but
there
were
but
two
things
to
do
either
to
have
sent
to
william
at
once
and
offered
him
the
crown
if
he
would
but
guarantee
the
danish
laws
and
liberties
to
all
north
of
the
watling
street
and
if
he
would
fall
on
the
godwinssons
themselves
by
fair
means
or
foul
and
send
their
heads
to
or
what
or
have
marched
down
after
him
with
every
man
they
could
muster
and
thrown
themselves
on
the
frenchman
s
flank
in
the
battle
or
between
him
and
the
sea
cutting
him
off
from
france
or
o
that
i
had
but
been
there
what
things
could
i
have
done
and
now
these
two
wretched
boys
have
fooled
away
their
only
chance
some
say
that
they
hoped
for
the
crown
themselves
which
not
both
vain
babies
and
hereward
laughed
bitterly
i
suppose
one
will
murder
the
other
next
in
order
to
make
himself
the
stronger
by
being
the
sole
rival
to
the
tanner
the
midden
cock
sole
rival
to
the
eagle
boy
waltheof
will
set
up
his
claim
next
i
presume
as
siward
s
son
and
then
gospatrick
as
ethelred
s
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
till
they
all
eat
each
other
up
and
the
tanner
s
grandson
eats
the
last
what
care
i
tell
me
about
the
battle
my
lady
if
you
know
aught
that
is
more
to
my
way
than
their
and
torfrida
told
him
all
she
knew
of
the
great
fight
on
heathfield
down
which
men
call
senlac
and
the
battle
of
hastings
and
as
she
told
it
in
her
wild
eloquent
fashion
hereward
s
face
reddened
and
his
eyes
kindled
and
when
she
told
of
the
last
struggle
round
the
dragon
footnote
i
have
dared
to
differ
from
the
excellent
authorities
who
say
that
the
standard
was
that
of
a
fighting
man
because
the
bayeux
tapestry
represents
the
last
struggle
as
in
front
of
a
dragon
standard
which
must
be
as
is
to
be
expected
the
old
standard
of
wessex
the
standard
of
english
royalty
that
harold
had
also
a
fighting
man
standard
and
that
it
was
sent
by
william
to
the
pope
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
but
if
the
bayeux
tapestry
be
correct
the
fury
of
the
fight
for
the
standard
would
be
explained
it
would
be
a
fight
for
the
very
symbol
of
king
edward
s
dynasty
standard
of
harold
s
mighty
figure
in
the
front
of
all
hewing
with
his
great
axe
and
then
rolling
in
gore
and
agony
an
arrow
in
his
eye
of
the
last
rally
of
the
men
of
kent
of
gurth
the
last
defender
of
the
standard
falling
by
william
s
sword
the
standard
hurled
to
the
ground
and
the
popish
gonfanon
planted
in
its
place
then
hereward
s
eyes
for
the
first
and
last
time
for
many
a
year
were
flushed
with
noble
tears
and
springing
up
he
cried
honor
to
the
godwinssons
honor
to
the
southern
men
honor
to
all
true
english
hearts
why
was
i
not
there
to
go
with
them
to
valhalla
torfrida
caught
him
round
the
neck
because
you
are
here
my
hero
to
free
your
country
from
her
tyrants
and
win
yourself
immortal
fool
that
i
am
i
verily
believe
i
am
those
tears
said
she
as
she
kissed
them
away
are
more
precious
to
torfrida
than
the
spoils
of
a
hundred
fights
for
they
tell
me
that
hereward
still
loves
his
country
still
honors
virtue
even
in
a
and
thus
torfrida
whether
from
woman
s
sentiment
of
pity
or
from
a
woman
s
instinctive
abhorrence
of
villany
and
wrong
had
become
there
and
then
an
englishwoman
of
the
english
as
she
proved
by
strange
deeds
and
sufferings
for
many
a
year
where
is
that
norseman
martin
asked
hereward
that
night
ere
he
went
to
bed
i
want
to
hear
more
of
poor
you
can
t
speak
to
him
now
master
he
is
sound
asleep
this
two
hours
and
warm
enough
i
will
where
in
the
great
green
bed
with
blue
curtains
just
above
the
what
nonsense
is
this
the
bed
where
you
and
i
shall
lie
some
day
and
the
kitchen
which
we
shall
be
sent
down
to
to
turn
our
own
spits
unless
we
mend
our
manners
hereward
looked
at
the
man
madness
glared
in
his
eyes
unmistakably
you
have
killed
him
and
buried
him
cheating
the
villain
cried
hereward
seizing
him
take
your
hands
off
my
throat
master
he
was
only
my
hereward
stood
shocked
and
puzzled
after
all
the
man
was
and
would
not
be
missed
and
martin
lightfoot
letting
alone
his
madness
was
as
a
third
hand
and
foot
to
him
all
day
long
so
all
he
said
was
i
hope
you
have
buried
him
well
and
safely
you
may
walk
your
bloodhound
over
his
grave
without
finding
and
where
he
lay
hereward
never
knew
but
from
that
night
martin
got
a
trick
of
stroking
and
patting
his
little
axe
and
talking
to
it
as
if
it
had
been
alive
chapter
xviii
how
earl
godwin
s
widow
came
to
omer
it
would
be
vain
to
attempt
even
a
sketch
of
the
reports
which
came
to
flanders
from
england
during
the
next
two
years
or
of
the
conversation
which
ensued
thereon
between
baldwin
and
his
courtiers
or
hereward
and
torfrida
two
reports
out
of
three
were
doubtless
false
and
two
conversations
out
of
three
founded
on
those
false
reports
it
is
best
therefore
to
interrupt
the
thread
of
the
story
by
some
small
sketch
of
the
state
of
england
after
the
battle
of
hastings
that
so
we
may
at
least
guess
at
the
tenor
of
hereward
and
torfrida
s
counsels
william
had
as
yet
conquered
little
more
than
the
south
of
england
hardly
indeed
all
that
for
herefordshire
worcestershire
and
the
neighboring
parts
which
had
belonged
to
sweyn
harold
s
brother
were
still
insecure
and
the
noble
old
city
of
exeter
confident
in
her
roman
walls
did
not
yield
till
two
years
after
in
north
of
his
conquered
territory
mercia
stretched
almost
across
england
from
chester
to
the
wash
governed
by
edwin
and
morcar
the
two
fair
grandsons
of
leofric
the
great
earl
and
sons
of
alfgar
edwin
called
himself
earl
of
mercia
and
held
the
danish
burghs
on
the
extreme
northwest
the
roman
city
of
chester
was
his
while
on
the
extreme
southeast
as
domesday
book
testifies
morcar
held
large
lands
round
bourne
and
throughout
the
south
of
lincolnshire
besides
calling
himself
the
earl
of
northumbria
the
young
men
seemed
the
darlings
of
the
northmen

wales
was
their
nephew
northumbria
likewise
was
not
yet
in
william
s
hands
indeed
it
was
in
no
man
s
hands
since
the
free
danes
north
of
the
humber
had
expelled
tosti
harold
s
brother
putting
morcar
in
his
place
and
helped
that
brother
to
slay
him
at
stanford
brigg
morcar
instead
of
residing
in
his
earldom
of
northumbria
had
made
one
oswulf
his
deputy
but
he
had
rivals
enough
there
was
gospatrick
claiming
through
his
grandfather
uchtred
and
strong
in
the
protection
of
his
cousin
malcolm
king
of
scotland
there
was
young
waltheof
the
forest
thief
who
had
been
born
to
siward
biorn
in
his
old
age
just
after
the
battle
of
dunsinane
a
fine
and
gallant
young
man
destined
to
a
swift
and
sad
end
william
sent
to
the
northumbrians
one
copsi
a
thane
of
mark
and
worth
as
his
procurator
to
expel
oswulf
oswulf
and
the
answered
by
killing
copsi
and
doing
every
man
that
which
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
william
determined
to
propitiate
the
young
earls
perhaps
he
intended
to
govern
the
centre
and
north
of
england
through
them
as
feudal
vassals
and
hoped
meanwhile
to
pay
his
norman
conquerors
sufficiently
out
of
the
forfeited
lands
of
harold
and
those
who
had
fought
by
his
side
at
hastings
it
was
not
his
policy
to
make
himself
much
less
to
call
himself
the
conqueror
of
england
he
claimed
to
be
its
legitimate
sovereign
deriving
from
his
cousin
edward
the
confessor
and
whosoever
would
acknowledge
him
as
such
had
neither
right
nor
cause
to
fear
therefore
he
sent
for
the
young
earls
he
courted
waltheof
and
more
really
loved
him
he
promised
edwin
his
daughter
in
marriage
some
say
it
was
constance
afterwards
married
to
alan
fergant
of
brittany
but
it
may
also
have
been
the
beautiful
adelaide
who
none
knew
why
early
gave
up
the
world
and
died
in
a
convent
be
that
as
it
may
the
two
young
people
saw
each
and
loved
each
other
at
rouen
whither
william
took
waltheof
edwin
and
his
brother
as
honored
guests
in
name
in
reality
as
hostages
likewise
with
the
same
rational
and
prudent
policy
william
respected
the
fallen
royal
families
both
of
harold
and
of
edward
at
least
he
warred
not
against
women

the

under

the

heir
of

treated
by
william
not
only
with
courtesy

with
affection
and
allowed
to
rebel
when
he
did
rebel
with
impunity

the

of

become
a
civilized
chivalrous
christian
knight
his
mighty
forefather
would
have
split

a
frank
king
would
have
shaved
the
young
man
s
head
and
immersed
him
in
a
monastery
an
eastern
sultan
would
have
thrust
out
his
eyes
or
strangled
him
at
once
but
william
however
cruel
however
unscrupulous
had
a
knightly
heart
and
somewhat
of
a
christian
conscience
and
his
conduct
to
his
only
lawful
rival
is
a
noble
trait
amid
many
sins
so
far
all
went
well
till
william
went
back
to
france
to
be
likened
not
as
his
ancestors
to
the
gods
of
valhalla
or
the
barbarous
and
destroying
viking
of
mythic
ages
but
to
caesar
pompey
vespasian
and
the
civilized
and
civilizing
heroes
of
classic
rome
but
while
he
sat
at
the
easter
feast
at
fécamp
displaying
to
franks
flemings
and
bretons
as
well
as
to
his
own
normans
the
treasures
of
edward
s
palace
at
westminster
and
more
english
wealth
than
could
be
found
in
the

estate

gaul
while
he
sat
there
in
his
glory
with
his
young
dupes
edwin
morcar
and
waltheof
by
his
side
having
sent
harold
s

in
triumph
to
the

as
a
token
that
he
had
conquered
the
church
as
well
as
the

having
founded
abbeys

to
him

had

great
crime
at
that
very
hour
the
handwriting
was
on
the

unseen
by
man

he
and
his
policy
and
his

were
weighed
in
the
balance
and
found
wanting

now
broke
out
in
england
that
which
endured
as
long
as
she
was
a
mere
appanage
and
foreign
farm
of
norman
kings

hearts
and
homes
were

footnote
the
late
sir
f
palgrave
as
if
the
normans
released
from
all
authority
all
restraint
all
fear
of
retaliation
determined
to
reduce
the
english
nation
to
servitude
and
drive
them
to
in
the
latter
attempt
they
succeeded
but
too
soon
in
the
former
they
succeeded
at
last
but
they
paid
dearly
for
their
success
hot
young
englishmen
began
to
emigrate
some
went
to
the
court
of
constantinople
to
join
the
varanger
guard
and
have
their
chance
of
a
polotaswarf
like
harold
hardraade
some
went
to
scotland
to
malcolm
canmore
and
brooded
over
return
and
revenge
but
harold
s
sons
went
to
their
father
s
cousin
to
sweyn
swend
sweno
ulfsson
and
called
on
him
to
come
and
reconquer
england
in
the
name
of
his
uncle
canute

many
an
englishman
went

gospatrick
watched
as
earl
so
far
as
he
could
make
any
one
obey
him
in
the
utter
subversion
of
all
order
of
the
lands
between
forth
and
tyne
and
he
determined
to
flee
ere
evil
befell
him
to
his
cousin
malcolm
canmore
taking
with
him
marlesweyn
of
lincolnshire
who
had
fought
it
is
said
by
harold
s
side
at
hastings
and
young
waltheof
of
york
but
moreover
having
a
head
and
being
indeed
as
his
final
success
showed
a
man
of
ability
and
courage
he
determined
on
a
stroke
of
policy
which
had
incalculable
on
the
history
of
scotland
he
persuaded
agatha
the
hungarian
margaret
and
christina
her
daughters
and
edgar
the
etheling
himself
to
flee
with
him
to
scotland

he

to
romsey
far
south
in
hampshire
how
they
contrived
to
escape
to
the
humber
and
thence
up
to
the
forth
this
is
a
romance
in
itself
of
which
the
chroniclers
have
left
hardly
a
hint
but
the
thing
was
done
and
at
margaret
s
hope
as
tradition
tells
the
scottish
king
met
and
claimed
as
his
unwilling
bride
that
fair
and
holy
maiden
who
was
destined
to
soften
his
fierce
passions
to
civilize
and
purify
his
people
and
to
become
if
all
had
their
just
dues
the
true
patron
saint
of
scotland
malcolm
canmore
promised
a
mighty
army
sweyn
a
mighty
fleet
and
meanwhile
eustace
of
boulogne
the
confessor
s
himself
a
norman
rebelled
at
the
head
of
the
men
of
kent
and
the
welshmen
were
harrying
herefordshire
with
fire
and
sword
in
revenge
for
norman
ravages
but
as
yet
the
storm
did
not
burst
william
returned
and
with
him
something
like
order
he
conquered
exeter
he
destroyed
churches
and
towns
to
make
his
new
forest
he
brought
over
his
queen
matilda
with
pomp
and
great
glory
and
with
her
the
bayeux
tapestry
which
she
had
wrought
with
her
own
hands
and
meanwhile
sweyn
ulfsson
was
too
busy
threatening
olaf
haroldsson
the
new
king
of
norway
to
sail
for
england
and
the
sons
of
king
harold
of
england
had
to
seek
help
from
the
irish
danes
and
ravaging
the
country
round
bristol
be
beaten
off
by
the
valiant
burghers
with
heavy
loss
so
the
storm
did
not
burst
and
need
not
have
burst
it
may
be
at
all
had
william
kept
his
plighted
word
but
he
would
not
give
his
fair
daughter
to
edwin
his
norman
nobles
doubtless
looked
upon
such
an
alliance
as
debasing
to
a
civilized
lady
in
their
eyes
the
englishman
was
a
barbarian
and
though
the
norman
might
well
marry
the
englishwoman
if
she
had
beauty
or
wealth
it
was
a
dangerous
precedent
to
allow
the
englishman
to
marry
the
norman
woman
and
that
woman
a
princess
beside
there
were
those
who
coveted
edwin
s
broad
lands
roger
de
montgomery
who
already
it
is
probable
held
part
of
them
as
earl
of
shrewsbury
had
no
wish
to
see
edwin
the
of
his
sovereign
be
the
cause
what
it
may
william
faltered
and
refused
and
edwin
and
morcar
left
the
court
of
westminster
in
wrath
waltheof
followed
them
having
discovered
what
he
was
weak
enough
continually
to
forget
again
the
treachery
of
the
norman
the
young
earls
went
off
one
midlandward
one
northward
the
people
saw
their
wrongs
in
those
of
their
earls
and
the
rebellion
burst
forth
at
once
the
welsh
under
blethyn
and
the
cumbrians
under
malcolm
and
donaldbain
giving
their
help
in
the
struggle
it
was
the
year
a
more
evil
year
for
england
than
even
the
year
of
hastings
the
rebellion
was
crushed
in
a
few
months
the
great
general
marched
steadily
north
taking
the
boroughs
one
by
one
storming
massacring
young
and
old
burning
sometimes
whole
towns
and
leaving
as
he
went
on
a
new
portent
a
norman
donjon
till
then
all
but
unseen

england
as
a
place

the
huge
barrow

doomed

borough

castle
with
its
tall
square
tower
within
its
bailey
around
and
all
the
appliances
of
that
ancient
roman
science
of
fortification
of
which
the
danes
as
well
as
the
saxons
knew
nothing
their
struggle
had
only
helped
to
tighten
their
bonds
and
what
wonder
there
was
among
them
neither
unity
nor
plan
nor
governing

and
will
hereward
s
words
had
come
true
the
only
man
save
gospatrick
who
had
a
head
in
england
was
harold
godwinsson
and
he
lay
in
waltham
abbey
while
the
monks
sang
masses
for
his
soul
edwin
morcar
and
waltheof
trembled
before
a
genius
superior
to
their
own
a
genius
indeed
which
had
not
its
equal
then
in
christendom
they
came
in
and
begged
grace
of
the
king
they
got
it
but
edwin
s
earldom
was
forfeited
and
he
and
his
brother
became
from
thenceforth
desperate
men
malcolm
of
scotland
trembled
likewise
and
asked
for
peace
the
clans
it
is
said
rejoiced
thereat
having
no
wish
for
a
war
which
could
buy
them
neither
spoil
nor
land
malcolm
sent
ambassadors
to
william
and
took
that
oath
of
fealty
to
the
basileus
of
britain
which
more
than
one
scottish
king
and
kinglet
had
taken
before
with
the
secret
proviso
which
during
the
middle
ages
seems
to
have
been
thoroughly
understood
in
such
cases
by
both
parties
that
he
should
be
william
s
man
just
as
long
as
william
could
compel
him
to
be
so
and
no
longer
then
came
cruel
and
unjust
confiscations
ednoth
the
had
fallen
at
bristol
fighting
for
william
against
the
haroldssons
yet
all
his
lands
were
given
away
to
normans
edwin
and
morcar
s
lands
were
parted
likewise
and
to
specify
cases
which
bear
especially
on
the
history

many
of
morcar
s
manors
round
bourne
and
gilbert
of

many
belonging
to

about
lincoln
city
and
so
did
that
valiant
and
crafty
knight
find
his
legs
once
more
on
other
men
s
ground
and
reappears
in
monkish
story
as
the
most
devout
and
pious
earl
gilbert
of
what
followed
hereward
heard
not
from
flying
rumors
but
from
one
who
had
seen
and
known
and
judged
of
all
footnote
for
gyda
s
coming
to
omer
that
year
see
ordericus
vitalis
for
one
day
about
this
time
hereward
was
riding
out
of
the
gate
of
omer
when
the
porter
appealed
to
him
begging
for
admittance
were
some
twenty
women
and
a
clerk
or
two
and
they
must
needs
see
the
châtelain
the
châtelain
was
away
what
should
he
do
hereward
looked
at
the
party
and
saw
to
his
surprise
that
they
were
englishwomen
and
two
of
them
women
of
rank
to
judge
from
the
rich
materials
of
their
and
tattered
garments
the
ladies
rode
on
sorry
country
garrons
plainly
hired
from
the
peasants
who
drove
them
the
rest
of
the
women
had
walked
and
weary
and
footsore
enough
they
were
you
are
surely
englishwomen
asked
he
of
the
foremost
as
he
lifted
his
cap
the
lady
bowed
assent
beneath
a
heavy
veil
then
you
are
my
guests
let
them
pass
and
hereward
threw
himself
off
his
horse
and
took
the
lady
s
bridle
stay
she
said
with
an
accent
half
wessex
half
danish
i
seek
the
countess
judith
if
it
will
please
you
to
tell
me
where
she
the
countess
judith
lady
lives
no
longer
in
omer
since
her
husband
s
death
she
lives
with
her
mother
at
the
lady
made
a
gesture
of
disappointment
it
were
best
for
you
therefore
to
accept
my
hospitality
till
such
time
as
i
can
send
you
and
your
ladies
on
to
i
must
first
know
who
it
is
who
offers
me
hospitality
this
was
said
so
proudly
that
hereward
answered
proudly
enough
in
return
i
am
hereward
leofricsson
whom
his
foes
call
hereward
the
outlaw
and
his
friends
hereward
the
master
of
she
started
and
threw
her
veil
hack
looking
intently
at
him
he
for
his
part
gave
but
one
glance
and
then
cried
mother
of
heaven
you
are
the
great
countess
yes
i
was
that
woman
once
if
all
be
not
a
dream
i
am
now
i
know
not
what
seeking
hospitality
if
i
can
believe
my
eyes
and
ears
of
godiva
s
and
from
godiva
s
son
you
shall
have
it
as
though
you
were
godiva
s
self
god
so
deal
with
my
mother
madam
as
i
will
deal
with
his
father
s
wit
and
his
mother
s
beauty
said
the
great
countess
looking
upon
him
too
too
like
my
own
lost
harold
not
so
my
lady
i
am
a
dwarf
compared
to
and
hereward
led
the
garron
on
by
the
bridle
keeping
his
cap
in
hand
while
all
wondered
who
the
dame
could
be
before
whom
hereward
the
champion
would
so
abase
himself
leofric
s
son
does
me
too
much
honor
he
has
forgotten
in
his
chivalry
that
i
am
godwin
s
i
have
not
forgotten
that
you
are
sprakaleg
s
daughter
and
niece
of
canute
king
of
kings
neither
have
i
forgotten
that
you
are
an
english
lady
in
times
in
which
all
english
folk
are
one
and
all
old
english
feuds
are
wiped
in
english
blood
ah
if
these
last
words
of
yours
were
true
as
you
perhaps
might
make
them
true
england
might
be
saved
even
saved
if
there
were
one
man
in
it
who
cared
for
aught
but
hereward
was
silent
and
thoughtful
he
had
sent
martin
back
to
his
house
to
tell
torfrida
to
prepare
bath
and
food
for
the
countess
gyda
with
all
her
train
was
coming
to
be
her
guest
and
when
they
entered
the
court
torfrida
stood
ready
is
this
your
lady
asked
gyda
as
hereward
lifted
her
from
her
horse
i
am
his
lady
and
your
servant
said
torfrida
bowing
child
child
bow
not
to
me
talk
not
of
servants
to
a
wretched
slave
who
only
longs
to
crawl
into
some
hole
and
die
forgetting
all
she
was
and
all
she
and
the
great
countess
reeled
with
weariness
and
woe
and
fell
upon
torfrida
s
neck
a
tall
veiled
lady
next
her
helped
to
support
her
and
between
them
they
almost
carried
her
through
the
hall
and
into
torfrida
s
best
and
there
they
gave
her
wine
and
comforted
her
and
let
her
weep
awhile
in
peace
the
second
lady
had
unveiled
herself
displaying
a
beauty
which
was
still
brilliant
in
spite
of
sorrow
hunger
the
stains
of
travel
and
more
than
forty
years
of
life
she
must
be
gunhilda
guessed
torfrida
to
herself
and
not
amiss
she
offered
gyda
a
bath
which
she
accepted
eagerly
like
a
true
dane
i
have
not
washed
for
weeks
not
since
we
sat
starving
on
the
there
in
the
severn
sea
i
have
become
as
foul
as
my
own
fortunes
and
why
not
it
is
all
of
a
piece
why
should
not
beggars
beg
unwashed
but
when
torfrida
offered
gunhilda
the
bath
she
declined
i
have
done
lady
with
such
carnal
vanities
what
use
in
cleansing
that
body
which
is
itself
unclean
and
whitening
the
outside
of
this
sepulchre
if
i
can
but
cleanse
my
soul
fit
for
my
heavenly
bridegroom
the
body
may
become
as
it
must
at
last
food
for
she
will
needs
enter
religion
poor
child
said
gyda
and
what
wonder
i
have
chosen
the
better
part
and
it
shall
not
be
taken
from
taken
taken
hark
to
her
she
means
to
mock
me
the
proud
nun
with
that
same
god
forbid
mother
then
why
say
taken
to
me
from
whom
all
is
taken
husband
sons
wealth
land
renown
power
power
which
i
loved
wretch
that
i
was
as
well
as
husband
and
as
sons
ah
god
the
girl
is
right
better
to
rot
in
the
convent
than
writhe
in
the
world
better
never
to
have
had
than
to
have
had
and
amen
said
gunhilda
blessed
are
the
barren
and
they
that
never
gave
suck
saith
the
no
not
so
cried
torfrida
better
countess
to
have
had
and
lost
than
never
to
have
had
at
all
the
glutton
was
right
swine
as
he
was
when
he
said
that
not
even
heaven
could
take
from
him
the
dinners
he
had
eaten
how
much
more
we
if
we
say
not
even
heaven
can
take
from
us
the
love
wherewith
we
have
loved
will
not
our
souls
be
richer
thereby
through
all
eternity
in
purgatory
asked
gunhilda
in
purgatory
or
where
else
you
will
i
love
my
love
and
though
my
love
prove
false
he
has
been
true
though
he
trample
me
under
foot
he
has
held
me
in
his
bosom
though
he
kill
me
he
has
lived
for
me
what
i
have
had
will
still
be
mine
when
that
which
i
have
shall
fail
and
you
would
buy
short
joy
with
lasting
woe
that
would
i
like
a
brave
man
s
child
i
say
the
present
is
mine
and
i
will
enjoy
it
as
greedily
as
a
child
let
the
morrow
take
thought
for
the
things
of
countess
your
bath
is
nineteen
years
after
when
the
great
conqueror
lay
tossing
with
agony
and
remorse
upon
his
dying
bed
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
his
victims
the
clerks
of
saviour
s
in
bruges
city
were
putting
up
a
leaden
tablet
which
remains
they
say
unto
this
very
day
to
the
memory
of
one
whose
gentle
soul
had
gently
passed
away
charitable
to
the
poor
kind
and
agreeable
to
her
attendants
courteous
to
strangers
and
only
severe
to
herself
gunhilda
had
lingered
on
in
a
world
of
war
and
crime
and
had
gone
it
may
be
to
meet
torfrida
beyond
the
grave
and
there
finish
their
doubtful
argument
the
countess
was
served
with
food
in
torfrida
s
chamber
hereward
and
his
wife
refused
to
sit
and
waited
on
her
standing
i
wish
to
show
these
saucy
flemings
said
he
that
an
english
princess
is
a
princess
still
in
the
eyes
of
one
more
nobly
born
than
any
of
but
after
she
had
eaten
she
made
torfrida
sit
before
her
on
the
bed
and
hereward
likewise
and
began
to
talk
eagerly
as
one
who
had
not
unburdened
her
mind
for
many
weeks
and
eloquently
too
as
became
sprakaleg
s
daughter
and
godwin
s
wife
she
told
them
how
she
had
fled
from
the
storm
of
exeter
with
a
troop
of
women
who
dreaded
the
brutalities
of
the
normans
footnote
to
do
william
justice
he
would
not
allow
his
men
to
enter
the
city
while
they
were
and
so
prevented
as
far
as
he
could
the
excesses
which
gyda
had
feared
how
they
had
wandered
up
through
devon
found
fishers
boats
at
watchet
in
somersetshire
and
gone
off
to
the
little
desert
island
of
the

hopes
of
there
meeting
with
the
irish
fleet
which
her
sons
edmund
and
godwin
were
bringing
against
the
west
of
england
how
the
fleet
had
never
come
and
they
had
starved
for
many
days
and
how
she
had
bribed
a
passing
merchantman
to
take
her
and
her
wretched
train
to
the
land
of
baldwin
the
débonnaire
who
might
have
pity
on
her
for
the
sake
of
his
daughter
judith
and
tosti
her
husband
who
died
in
his
sins
and
at
his
name
her
tears
began
to
flow
afresh
fallen
in
his
overweening
pride
like
sweyn
like
harold
like
herself
the
time
was
when
i
would
not
weep
if
i
could
i
would
not
for
a
year
lady
after
senlac
i
sat
like
a
stone
i
hardened
my
heart
like
a
wall
of
brass
against
god
and
man
then
there
upon
the
feeding
on
listening
to
the
wail
of
the
looking
outside
the
wan
water
for
the
sails
which
never
came
my
heart
broke
down
in
a
moment
and
i
heard
a
voice
crying
there
is
no
help
in
man
go
thou
to
and
i
answered
that
were
a
beggar
s
trick
to
go
to
god
in
need
when
i
went
not
to
him
in
plenty
no
without
god
i
planned
and
without
him
i
must
fail
without
him
i
went
into
the
battle
and
without
him
i
must
bide
the
brunt
and
at
best
can
he
give
me
back
my
sons
and
i
hardened
my
heart
again
like
a
stone
and
shed
no
tear
till
i
saw
your
fair
face
this
and
now
she
said
turning
sharply
on
hereward
what
do
you
do
here
do
you
not
know
that
your
nephews
lands
are
parted
between
grooms
from
angers
and
scullions
from
normandy
so
much
the
worse
for
both
them
and
the
sir
you
forget
lady
that
i
am
an
but
do
you
not
know
that
your
mother
s
lands
are
seized
likewise
she
will
take
refuge
with
her
grandsons
who
are
as
i
hear
again
on
good
terms
with
their
new
master
showing
thereby
a
most
laudable
and
christian
spirit
of
on
good
terms
do
you
not
know
then
that
they
are
fighting
again
outlaws
and
desperate
at
the
frenchman
s
treachery
do
you
not
know
that
they
have
been
driven
out
of
york
after
defending
the
city
street
by
street
house
by
house
do
you
not
know
that
there
is
not
an
old
man
or
a
child
in
arms
left
in
york
and
that
your
nephews
and
the
few
fighting
men
who
were
left
went
down
the
humber
in
boats
and
north
to
scotland
to
gospatrick
and
waltheof
do
you
not
know
that
your
mother
is
left
alone
at
bourne
or
god
knows
where
to
endure
at
the
hands
of
norman
ruffians
what
thousands
more
endure
hereward
made
no
answer
but
played
with
his
dagger
and
do
you
not
know
that
england
is
ready
to
burst
into
a
blaze
if
there
be
one
man
wise
enough
to
put
the
live
coal
into
the
right
place
that
sweyn
ulffson
his
kinsman
or
osbern
his
brother
will
surely
land
there
within
the
year
with
a
mighty
host
and
that
if
there
be
one
man
in
england
of
wit
enough
and
knowledge
enough
of
war
to
lead
the
armies
of
england
the
frenchman
may
be
driven
into
the
sea
is
there
any
here
who
understands
english
none
but
and
canute
s
nephew
sit
on
canute
s
throne
hereward
still
played
with
his
dagger
not
the
sons
of
harold
then
asked
he
after
a
while
never
i
promise
you
that
i
countess
gyda
their
why
promise
me
of
all
men
o
great
lady
because
i
will
tell
you
after
but
this
i
say
my
curse
on
the
grandson
of
mine
who
shall
try
to
seize
that
fatal
crown
which
cost
the
life
of
my
fairest
my
noblest
my
wisest
my
bravest
hereward
bowed
his
head
as
if
consenting
to
the
praise
of
harold
but
he
knew
who
spoke
and
he
was
thinking
within
himself
her
curse
may
be
on
him
who
shall
seize
and
yet
not
on
him
to
whom
it
is
all
that
they
young
and
unskilful
lads
have
a
right
to
ask
is
their
father
s
earldoms
and
their
father
s
lands
edwin
and
morcar
would
keep
their
earldoms
as
of
right
it
is
a
pity
that
there
is
no
lady
of
the
house
of
godwin
whom
we
could
honor
by
offering
her
to
one
of
your
nephews
in
return
for
their
nobleness
in
giving
aldytha
to
my
harold
but
this
foolish
girl
here
refuses
to
wed
and
is
past
forty
thought
hereward
to
himself
however
some
plan
to
join
the
families
more
closely
together
might
be
thought
of
one
of
the
young
earls
might
marry
judith
here
footnote
tosti
s
widow
daughter
of
baldwin
of
flanders
waltheof
would
have
northumbria
in
right
of
his
father
and
ought
to
be
well
content
for
although
she
is
somewhat
older
than
he
she
is
peerlessly
beautiful
to
marry
your
niece

widow
and

as

northumbria
if

it
he

our

will
be

once
and
but
what
of
sweyn
s
gallant
holders
and
housecarles
who
are
to
help
to
do
this
mighty
deed
senlac
left
gaps
enough
among
the
noblemen
of
the
south
which
they
can
fill
up
in
the
place
of
the
french
scum
who
now
riot
over
wessex
and
if
that
should
not
suffice
what
higher
honor
for
me
or
for
my
daughter
the
than
to
devote
our
lands
to
the
heroes
who
have
won
them
back
for
us
hereward
hoped
inwardly
that
gyda
would
be
as
good
as
her
word
for
her
greedy
grasp
had
gathered
to
itself
before
the
battle
of
hastings
no
less
than
thousand
acres
of
good
english
soil
i
have
always
heard
said
he
bowing
that
if
the
lady
gyda
had
been
born
a
man
england
would
have
had
another
and
statesman
and
earl
godwin
a
rival
instead
of
a
helpmate
now
i
believe
what
i
have
but
torfrida
looked
sadly
at
the
countess
there
was
something
pitiable
in
the
sight
of
a
woman
ruined
bereaved
seemingly
hopeless
portioning
out
the
very
land
from
which
she
was
a
fugitive
unable
to
restrain
the
passion
for
intrigue
which
had
been
the
toil
and
the
bane
of
her
sad
and
splendid
life
and
now
she
went
on
surely
some
kind
saint
brought
me
even
on
my
first
landing
to
you
of
all
living
doubtless
the
blessed
bertin
beneath
whose
shadow
we
repose
here
in
peace
said
hereward
somewhat
dryly
i
will
go
barefoot
to
his
altar
and
offer
my
last
jewel
said
gunhilda
you
said
gyda
without
noticing
her
daughter
are
above
all
men
the
man
who
is
and
she
began
praising
hereward
s
valor
his
fame
his
eloquence
his
skill
as
a
general
and
engineer
and
when
he
suggested
smiling
that
he
was
an
exile
and
an
outlaw
she
insisted
that
he
was
all
the
fitter
from
that
very
fact
he
had
no
enemies
among
the
nobles
he
had
been
mixed
up
in
none
of
the
civil
wars
and
blood
feuds
of
the
last
fifteen
years
he
was
known
only
as
that
which
he
was
the
ablest
captain
of
his
day
the
only
man
who
could
cope
with
william
the
only
man
whom
all
parties
in
england
would
alike
obey
and
so
with
flattery
as
well
as
with
truth
she
persuaded
if
not
hereward
at
least
torfrida
that
he
was
the
man
destined
to
free
england
once
more
and
that
an
earldom
anything
which
he
chose
to
ask
would
be
the
sure
reward
of
his
assistance
torfrida
said
hereward
that
night
kiss
me
well
for
you
will
not
kiss
me
again
for
a
what
i
am
going
to
england
alone

and
martin
to
spy
out
the
land
and
a
dozen
or
so
of
housecarles
to
take
care
of
the
ship
in

you
have
promised
to
fight
the
viscount
of

will
be
back
again
in

for
him
not
a
word
i
must
go
to

gyda

will
squire
her
to
bruges
you
and
the
rest
of

you
must
tell
her
all
she

tell
baldwin
i
shall
be

she
cried
herself
to
sleep
upon
his
bosom
but
she
knew
that
it
was
the
right
and
knightly
and
christian
thing
to
do
two
days
after
a
long
ship
ran
out
of
calais
and
sailed
away
north
and
east
chapter
xix
how
hereward
cleared
bourne
of
frenchmen
it
may
have
been
well
a
week
after
that
hereward
rode
from
the
direction
of
boston
with
martin
running
at
his
heels
as
hereward
rode
along
the
summer
wold
the
summer
sun
sank
low
till
just
before
it
went
down
he
came
to
an
island
of
small
enclosed
fields
high
banks
and
a
farm
inside
one
of
those
most
ancient
holdings
of
the
south
and
east
counts
still
to
be
distinguished
by
their
huge
banks
and
dikes
full
of
hedgerow
timber
from
the
more
modern
outside
which
were
in
hereward
s
time
mostly
common
this
should
be

said
he
and
there
inside
as
i
live
stands
azer
getting
in
his
crops
but
who
has
he
with
him
with
the
old

were
some
men
of
his
own
rank

or
two
standing
on

of
the
rascally
normans

we
have
come
back
and
a
very
strong
fortress
are
they
holding

hereward
against

norman
horsemen

norman
arrows
how
to
dislodge
those
six
fellows
without
six
times
their
number
i
do
not
see
it
is
well
to
recollect
and
so
he
did
and
turned
to
use
again
and
again
in
after
years
the
strategetic
capabilities
of
an
english
farm
hereward
spurred
his
horse
up
to
the
nearest
gate
and
was
instantly
confronted
by
a
little
man
as
broad
as
he
was
tall
who
heaved
up
a
long
twybill
or
double
axe
and
bade
him
across
the

go
to
a

shrieked
the
doughty
little
man
i
took
you
for
an
accursed
norman
in
those
outlandish
clothes
and
lifting
up
no
little
voice
he
shouted
hereward
is
back
and
martin
lightfoot
at
his
heels
the
gate
was
thrown
open
and
hereward
all
but
pulled
off
his
horse
he
was
clapped
on
the
back
turned
round
and
round
admired
from
head
to
foot
shouted
at
by
old
companions
of
his
boyhood
naughty
young
housecarles
of

troop
now
settled
down
into

again

of

doings
over

was

hereward

valiant

and
ulfard
the
white
and
others
some
of
whose
names
and
those
of
their

still
stand
in
and
what
asked
hereward
after
the
first
congratulations
were
over
of
my
mother
what
of
the
folk
at
bourne
all
looked
each
at
the
other
and
were
silent
you
are
too
late
young
lord
said
azer
too
late
the
norman
azer
called
him
what
most
men
called
him
then
has
given
it
to
a
man
of
gilbert
of
ghent
s
his
butler
groom
cook
for
aught
i
to
gilbert
s
man
and
my
mother
god
help
your
mother
and
your
young
brother
too
we
only
know
that
three
days
ago
some
french
marched
into
the
and
you
did
not
stop
them
young
sir
who
are
we
to
stop
an
army
we
have
enough
to
keep
our
own
gilbert
let
alone
the
villain
ivo
of
spalding
can
send
a
hundred
men
down
on
us
in
then
i
said
hereward
in
a
voice
of
thunder
will
find
the
way
to
send
two
hundred
down
on
him
and
turning
his
horse
from
the
gate
he
rode
away
furiously
towards
bourne
he
turned
back
as
suddenly
and
galloped
into
the
field
lads
old
comrades
will
you
stand
by
me
if
i
need
you
will
you
follow
hereward
as
hundreds
have
followed
him
already
if
he
will
only
go
before
we
will
we
i
shall
be
back
ere
morning
what
you
have
to
do
i
will
tell
you
stop
and
eat
but
for
a
quarter
of
an
then
hereward
swore
a
great
oath
by
oak
and
ash
and
thorn
that
he
would
neither
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
while
there
was
a
norman
left
in
bourne
a
little
ale
then
if
no
water
said
azer
hereward
laughed
and
rode
away
you
will
not
go
against
all
those
ruffians
shouted
the
old
man
after
him
saddle
lads
and
go
with
him
some
of
you
for
very
shame
s
but
when
they
galloped
after
hereward
he
sent
them
back
he
did
not
know
yet
he
said
what
he
would
do
better
that
they
should
gather
their
forces
and
see
what
men
they
could
afford
him
in
case
of
open
battle
and
he
rode
swiftly
on
when
he
came
within
the
lands
of
bourne
it
was
dark
so
much
the
better
thought
hereward
i
have
no
wish
to
see
the
old
place
till
i
have
somewhat
cleaned
it
he
rode
slowly
into
the
long
street
between
the
overhanging
gables
at
the
upper
end
he
could
see
the
high
garden
walls
of
his
mother
s
house
and
rising
over
them
the
great
hall
its
narrow
windows
all
ablaze
with
light
with
a
bitter
growl
he
rode
on
trying
to
recollect
a
house
where
he
could
safely
lodge
martin
pointed
one
out
old
viking
surturbrand
the
housecarle
did
live
there
and
maybe
lives
there
we
will
and
martin
knocked
at
the
door
the
wicket
was
opened
but
not
the
door
and
through
the
wicket
window
a
surly
voice
asked
who
was
there
who
lives
here
perry
son
of
surturbrand
who
art
thou
who
askest
an
honest
gentleman
and
his
servant
looking
for
a
night
s
this
is
no
place
for
honest
as
for
that
we
don
t
wish
to
be
more
honest
than
you
would
have
us
but
lodging
we
will
pay
for
freely
and
we
want
none
of
your
money
and
the
wicket
was
shut
martin
pulled
out
his
axe
and
drove
the
panel
in
what
are
you
doing
we
shall
rouse
the
town
said
hereward
let
be
these
are
no
french
but
honest
english
and
like
one
all
the
better
for
a
little
what
didst
do
that
for
asked
the
surly
voice
again
were
it
not
for
those
rascal
frenchmen
up
above
i
would
come
out
and
split
thy
skull
for
if
there
be
frenchmen
up
above
said
martin
in
a
voice
of
feigned
terror
take
us
in
for
the
love
of
the
virgin
and
all
the
saints
or
murdered
we
shall
be
ere
morning
you
have
no
call
to
stay
in
the
town
man
unless
you
hereward
rode
close
to
the
wicket
and
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
a
nobleman
of
flanders
good
sir
and
a
sworn
foe
to
all
french
my
horse
is
weary
and
can
not
make
a
step
forward
and
if
you
be
a
christian
man
you
will
take
me
in
and
let
me
go
off
safe
ere
morning
from
flanders
and
the
man
turned
and
seemed
to
consult
those
within
at
length
the
door
was
slowly
opened
and
perry
appeared
his
double
axe
over
his
shoulder
if
you
be
from
flanders
come
in
for
mercy
but
be
quick
ere
those
frenchmen
get
wind
of
hereward
went
in
five
or
six
men
were
standing
round
the
long
table
upon
which
they
had
just
laid
down
their
double
axes
and
javelins
more
than
one
countenance
hereward
recognized
at
once
over
the
in
the
sat
a
very
old
man
his
hands
upon
his
knees
as
he
warmed
his
bare
feet
at
the
embers
he
started
up
at
the
noise
and
hereward
saw
at
once
that
it
was
old
surturbrand
and
that
he
was
blind
who
is
it
is
hereward
come
asked
he
with
the
dull
dreamy
voice
of
age
not
hereward
father
said
some
one
but
a
knight
from
the
old
man
dropped
his
head
upon
his
breast
again
with
a
querulous
whine
while
hereward
s
heart
beat
high
at
hearing
his
own
name
at
all
events
he
was
among
friends
and
approaching
the
table
he
unbuckled
his
sword
and
laid
it
down
among
the
other
weapons
at
least
said
he
i
shall
have
no
need
of
thee
as
long
as
i
am
here
among
honest
what
shall
i
do
with
my
master
s
horse
asked
martin
he
can
t
stand
in
the
street
to
be
stolen
by
drunken
french
bring
him
in
at
the
front
door
and
out
at
the
back
said
perry
fine
times
these
when
a
man
dare
not
open
his
own
you
seem
to
be
all
besieged
here
said
hereward
how
is
this
besieged
we
are
said
the
man
and
then
partly
to
turn
the
subject
off
will
it
please
you
to
eat
noble
sir
hereward
ate
and
drank
while
his
hosts
eyed
him
not
without
some
lingering
suspicion
but
still
with
admiration
and
some
respect
his
splendid
armor
and
weapons
as
well
as
the
golden
locks
which
fell
far
below
his
shoulders
and
conveniently
hid
a
face
which
he
did
not
wish
yet
to
have
recognized
showed
him
to
be
a
man
of
the
highest
rank
while
the
palm
of
his
small
hand
as
hard
and
bony
as
any
woodman
s
proclaimed
him
to
be
no
novice
of
a
fighting
man
the
strong
flemish
accent
which
both
he
and
martin
lightfoot
had
assumed
prevented
the
honest
englishmen
from
piercing
his
disguise
they
watched
him
while
he
in
turn
watched
them
struck
by
their
uneasy
looks
and
sullen
silence
we
are
a
dull
company
said
he
after
a
while
courteously
enough
we
used
to
be
told
in
flanders
that
there
were
none
such
stout
drinkers
and
none
such
jolly
singers
as
you
gallant
men
of
the
danelagh
dull
times
make
dull
company
said
one
and
no
offence
to
you
sir
are
you
such
a
stranger
asked
perry
that
you
do
not
know
what
has
happened
in
this
town
during
the
last
three
days
no
good
i
will
warrant
if
you
have
frenchmen
in
why
was
not
hereward
here
wailed
the
old
man
in
the
corner
it
never
would
have
happened
if
he
had
been
in
the
what
asked
hereward
trying
to
command
himself
what
has
happened
said
perry
makes
a
free
englishman
s
blood
boil
to
tell
of
here
sir
knight
three
days
ago
comes
in
this
frenchman
with
some
twenty
ruffians
of
his
own
and
more
of
one
taillebois
s
too
to
see
him
safe
says
that
this
new
king
this
frenchman
has
given
away
all
earl
morcar
s
lands
and
that
bourne
is
his
kills
a
man
or
two
upsets
the
women
gets
drunk
ruffles
and
roisters
breaks
into
my
lady
s
bower
calling
her
to
give
up
her
keys
and
when
she
gives
them
will
have
all
her
jewels
too
she
faces
them
like
a
brave
princess
and
two
of
the
hounds
lay
hold
of
her
and
say
that
she
shall
ride
through
bourne
as
she
rode
through
coventry
the
boy
godwin
he
that
was
the
great
earl
s
godson
our
last
hope
the
last
of
our
house
draws
sword
on
them
and
he
a
boy
of
sixteen
summers
kills
them
both
out
of
hand
the
rest
set
on
him
cut
his
head
off
and
there
it
sticks
on
the
gable
spike
of
the
hall
to
this
hour
and
do
you
ask
after
that
why
free
englishmen
are
dull
company
and
our
turn
will
come
next
growled
somebody
the
turn
will
go
all
round
no
man
s
life
or
land
wife
or
daughters
will
be
safe
soon
for
these
accursed
frenchmen
unless
as
the
old
man
says
hereward
comes
once
again
the
old
man
wailed
out
of
the
why
did
they
ever
send
hereward
away
i
warned
the
good
earl
i
warned
my
good
lady
many
a
time
to
let
him
sow
his
wild
oats
and
be
done
with
them
or
they
might
need
him
some
day
when
they
could
not
find
him
he
was
a
lad
he
was
a
lad
and
again
he
whined
and
sank
into
silence
hereward
heard
all
this
hardening
his
heart
into
a
great
resolve
this
is
a
dark
story
said
he
calmly
and
it
would
behoove
me
as
a
gentleman
to
succor
this
distressed
lady
did
i
but
know
how
tell
me
what
i
can
do
now
and
i
will
do
your
health
cried
one
you
speak
like
a
true
and
he
looks
the
man
to
keep
his
word
i
ll
warrant
him
spoke
another
he
does
said
perry
shaking
his
head
but
if
anything
could
have
been
done
sir
be
sure
we
would
have
done
it
but
all
our
armed
men
are
scattered
up
and
down
the
country
each
taking
care
as
is
natural
of
his
own
cattle
and
his
own
women
there
are
not
ten
in
bourne
this
night
and
what
is
worse
sir
as
you
know
who
seem
to
have
known
war
as
well
as
me
there
is
no
man
to
lead
here
hereward
was
on
the
point
of
saying
and
what
if
i
led
you
on
the
point
too
of
discovering
himself
but
he
stopped
short
was
it
fair
to
involve
this
little
knot
of
gallant
fellows
in
what
might
be
a
hopeless
struggle
and
have
all
bourne
burned
over
their
heads
ere
morning
by
the
ruffian
frenchmen
no
his
mother
s
quarrel
was
his
own
private
quarrel
he
would
go
alone
and
see
the
strength
of
the
enemy
and
after
that
may
be
he
would
raise
the
country
on
them
or
and
half
a
dozen
plans
suggested
themselves
to
his
crafty
brain
as
he
sat
brooding
and
scheming
then
as
always
utterly
he
was
startled
by
a
burst
of
noise
outside
music
laughter
and
shouts
there
said
perry
bitterly
are
those
frenchmen
dancing
and
singing
in
the
hall
with
my
lord
godwin
s
head
above
them
and
curses
bitter
and
deep
went
round
the
room
they
sat
sullen
and
silent
it
may
be
for
an
hour
or
more
only
moving
when
at
some
fresh
outbreak
of
revelry
the
old
man
started
from
his
doze
and
asked
if
that
was
hereward
coming
and
who
is
this
hereward
of
whom
you
speak
said
hereward
at
last
we
thought
you
might
know
him
sir
knight
if
you
come
from
flanders
as
you
say
you
do
said
three
or
four
voices
in
a
surprised
and
surly
tone
certainly
i
know
such
a
man
if
he
be
hereward
the
wolf
hereward
the
outlaw
as
they
call
him
and
a
good
soldier
he
is
though
he
be
not
yet
made
a
knight
and
married
too
to
a
rich
and
fair
lady
i
served
under
this
hereward
a
few
months
ago
in
the
friesland
war
and
know
no
man
whom
i
would
sooner
nor
i
neither
chimed
in
martin
lightfoot
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
nor
we
cried
all
the
at
once
each
vying
with
the
other
in
extravagant
stories
of
their
hero
s
prowess
and
in
asking
the
knight
of
flanders
whether
they
were
true
or
not
to
avoid
offending
them
hereward
was
forced
to
confess
to
a
great
many
deeds
which
he
had
never
done
but
he
was
right
glad
to
find
that
his
fame
had
reached
his
native
place
and
that
he
could
count
on
the
men
if
he
needed
them
but
who
is
this
hereward
said
he
that
he
should
have
to
do
with
your
town
here
half
a
dozen
voices
at
once
told
him
his
own
story
i
always
heard
said
he
dryly
that
that
gentleman
was
of
some
very
noble
kin
and
i
will
surely
tell
him
all
that
has
befallen
here
as
soon
as
i
return
to
at
last
they
grew
sleepy
and
the
men
went
out
and
brought
in
bundles
of
sweet
rush
and
spread
them
against
the
wall
and
prepared
to
lie
down
each
his
weapon
by
his
side
and
when
they
were
lain
down
hereward
beckoned
to
him
perry
and
martin
lightfoot
and
went
out
into
the
back
yard
under
the
pretence
of
seeing
to
his
horse
perry
surturbrandsson
said
he
you
seem
to
be
an
honest
man
as
we
in
foreign
parts
hold
all
the
danelagh
to
be
now
it
is
fixed
in
my
mind
to
go
up
and
my
servant
to
your
hall
and
see
what
those
french
upstarts
are
about
will
you
trust
me
to
go
without
my
fleeing
back
here
if
i
am
found
out
or
in
any
way
bringing
you
to
harm
by
mixing
you
up
in
my
private
matters
and
will
you
if
i
do
not
come
back
keep
for
your
own
the
horse
which
is
in
your
stable
and
give
moreover
this
purse
and
this
ring
to
your
lady
if
you
can
find
means
to
see
her
face
to
face
and
say
thus
to
her
that
he
that
sent
that
purse
and
ring
may
be
found
if
he
be
alive
at
omer
or
with
baldwin
count
of
flanders
and
that
if
he
be
dead
as
he
is
like
enough
to
be
his
trade
being
naught
but
war
she
will
still
find
at
omer
a
home
and
wealth
and
friends
till
these
evil
times
be
overpast
as
hereward
had
spoken
with
some
slight
emotion
he
had
dropped
unawares
his
assumed
flemish
accent
and
had
spoken
in
broad
burly
lincolnshire
and
therefore
it
was
that
perry
who
had
been
staring
at
him
by
the
moonlight
all
the
while
said
when
he
was
done
tremblingly
either
you
are
hereward
or
you
are
his
fetch
you
speak
like
hereward
you
look
like
hereward
just
what
hereward
would
be
now
you
are
you
are
my
lord
and
you
can
not
deny
perry
if
you
know
me
speak
of
me
to
no
living
soul
save
to
your
lady
my
mother
and
let
me
and
my
go
free
out
of
your
if
i
ask
you
before
morning
to
open
it
again
to
me
you
will
know
that
there
is
not
a
frenchman
left
in
the
hall
of
perry
threw
his
arms
around
him
and
embraced
him
silently
get
me
only
said
hereward
some
long
woman
s
gear
and
black
mantle
if
you
can
to
cover
this
bright
armor
of
perry
went
off
in
silence
as
one
stunned
brought
the
mantle
and
let
them
out
of
the
in
ten
minutes
more
the
two
slipping
in
by
paths
stood
under
the
gable
of
the
great
hall
not
a
soul
was
stirring
outside
the
serfs
were
all
cowering
in
their
huts
like
so
many
rabbits
in
their
burrows
listening
in
fear
to
the
revelry
of
their
new
tyrants
the
night
was
dark
but
not
so
dark
but
that
hereward
could
see
between
him
and
the
sky
his
brother
s
long
locks
floating
in
the
breeze
that
i
must
have
done
at
least
said
he
in
a
low
voice
then
here
is
wherewithal
said
martin
lightfoot
as
he
stumbled
over
something
the
drunken
villains
have
left
the
ladder
in
the
hereward
got
up
the
ladder
took
down
the
head
and
wrapped
it
in
the
cloak
and
ere
he
did
so
kissed
the
cold
forehead
how
he
had
hated
that
boy
well
at
least
he
had
never
wilfully
harmed
him
or
the
boy
him
either
for
that
matter
and
now
he
had
died
like
a
man
killing
his
foe
he
was
of
the
true
old
blood
after
all
and
hereward
felt
that
he
would
have
given
all
that
he
had
save
his
wife
or
his
to
have
that
boy
alive
again
to
pet
him
and
train
him
and
teach
him
to
fight
at
his
side
then
he
slipped
round
to
one
of
the
narrow
unshuttered
windows
and
looked
in
the
hall
was
in
a
wasteful
blaze
of
light
a
whole
month
s
candles
burning
in
one
night
the
table
was
covered
with
all
his
father
s
choicest
plate
the
wine
was
running
waste
upon
the
floor
the
men
were
lolling
at
the
table
in
every
stage
of
drunkenness
the
loose
women
and
such
like
almost
as
drunk
as
their
masters
and
at
the
table
head
most
drunk
of
all
sat
in
earl
leofric
s
seat
the
new
lord
of
bourne
hereward
could
scarce
believe
his
eyes
he
was
none
other
than
gilbert
of
ghent
s
stout
flemish
cook
whom
he
had
seen
many
a
time
in
scotland
hereward
turned
from
the
window
in
disgust
but
looked
again
as
he
heard
words
which
roused
his
anger
still
more
for
in
the
open
space
nearest
the
door
stood
a
gleeman
a
dancing
harping
fellow
who
was
showing
off
ape
s
tricks
jesting
against
the
english
and
shuffling
about
in
mockeries
of
english
dancing
at
some
particularly
coarse
jest
of
his
the
new
lord
of
bourne
burst
into
a
roar
of
admiration
ask
what
thou
wilt
fellow
and
thou
shalt
have
it
thou
wilt
find
me
a
better
master
to
thee
than
ever
was
morcar
the
english
the
scoundrel
say
the
old
chroniclers
made
a
request
concerning
hereward
s
family
which
can
not
be
printed
here
hereward
ground
his
teeth
if
thou
livest
till
morning
light
said
he
i
will
the
last
brutality
awoke
some
better
feeling
in
one
of
the
girls
a
large
coarse
fleming
who
sat
by
the
new
lord
s
side
fine
words
said
she
scornfully
enough
for
the
sweepings
of
norman
and
flemish
kennels
you
forget
that
you
left
one
of
this
very
leofric
s
sons
behind
in
flanders
who
would
besom
all
out
if
he
was
here
before
the
morning
s
hereward
cried
the
cook
striking
her
down
with
a
drunken
blow
the
scoundrel
who
stole
the
money
which
the
frisians
sent
to
count
baldwin
and
gave
it
to
his
own
troops
we
are
safe
enough
from
him
at
all
events
he
dare
not
show
his
face
on
this
side
the
alps
for
fear
of
the
hereward
had
heard
enough
he
slipped
down
from
the
window
to
martin
and
led
him
round
the
house
now
then
down
with
the
ladder
quick
and
dash
in
the
door
i
go
in
stay
thou
outside
if
any
man
passes
me
see
that
he
pass
not
martin
chuckled
a
ghostly
laugh
as
he
helped
the
ladder
down
in
another
moment
the
door
was
burst
in
and
hereward
stood
upon
the
threshold
he
gave
one
his
own
terrible
name
and
then
rushed
forward
as
he
passed
the
gleeman
he
gave
him
one
stroke
across
the
loins
the
wretch
fell
shrieking
and
then
began
a
murder
grim
and
great
they
fought
with
with
knives
with
benches
but
drunken
and
unarmed
they
were
hewn
down
like
sheep
fourteen
normans
says
the
chronicler
were
in
the
hall
when
hereward
burst
in
when
the
sun
rose
there
were
fourteen
heads
upon
the
gable
escape
had
been
impossible
martin
had
laid
the
ladder
across
the
door
and
the
few
who
escaped
the
master
s
terrible
sword
stumbled
over
it
to
be
brained
by
the
man
s
not
less
terrible
axe
then
hereward
took
up
his
brother
s
head
and
went
in
to
his
mother
the
women
in
the
bower
opened
to
him
they
had
seen
all
that
passed
from
the
gallery
above
which
as
usual
hidden
by
a
curtain
enabled
the
women
to
watch
unseen
what
passed
in
the
hall
below
the
lady
godiva
sat
crouched
together
all
but
alone
for
her
had
fled
or
been
carried
off
long
since
upon
a
low
stool
beside
a
long
dark
thing
covered
with
a
pall
so
utterly
crushed
was
she
that
she
did
not
even
lift
up
her
head
as
hereward
entered
he
placed
his
ghastly
burden
reverently
beneath
the
pall
and
then
went
and
knelt
before
his
mother
for
a
while
neither
spoke
a
word
then
the
lady
godiva
suddenly
drew
back
her
hood
and
dropping
on
her
knees
threw
her
arms
round
hereward
s
neck
and
wept
till
she
could
weep
no
more
blessed
strong
arms
sobbed
she
at
last
around
me
to
feel
something
left
in
the
world
to
protect
me
something
left
in
the
world
which
loves
you
forgive
me
mother
you
forgive
me
it
was
i
i
who
was
in
fault
i
who
should
have
cherished
you
my
strongest
my
bravest
my
noblest
now
my
no
it
was
all
my
fault
and
on
my
head
is
all
this
misery
if
i
had
been
here
as
i
ought
to
have
been
all
this
might
have
never
you
would
only
have
been
murdered
too
no
thank
god
you
were
away
or
god
would
have
taken
you
with
the
rest
his
arm
is
bared
against
me
and
his
face
turned
away
from
me
all
in
vain
in
vain
vain
to
have
washed
my
hands
in
innocency
and
worshipped
him
night
and
day
vain
to
have
builded
minsters
in
his
honor
and
heaped
the
shrines
of
his
saints
with
gold
vain
to
have
fed
the
hungry
and
clothed
the
naked
and
washed
the
feet
of
his
poor
that
i
might
atone
for
my
own
sins
and
the
sins
of
my
house
this
is
his
answer
he
has
taken
me
up
and
dashed
me
down
and
naught
is
left
but
like
job
to
abhor
myself
and
repent
in
dust
and
ashes
of
i
know
not
god
has
not
deserted
you
see
he
has
sent
you
me
said
hereward
wondering
to
find
himself
of
all
men
on
earth
preaching
consolation
yes
i
have
you
hold
me
love
me
let
me
feel
that
one
thing
loves
me
upon
earth
i
want
love
i
must
have
it
and
if
god
and
his
mother
and
all
the
saints
refuse
their
love
i
must
turn
to
the
creature
and
ask
it
to
love
me
but
for
a
for
ever
you
will
not
leave
me
if
i
do
i
come
back
to
finish
what
i
have
more
blood
o
god
hereward
not
that
let
us
return
good
for
evil
let
us
take
up
our
crosses
let
us
humble
ourselves
under
god
s
hand
and
flee
into
some
convent
and
there
die
praying
for
our
country
and
our
men
must
work
while
women
pray
i
will
take
you
to
a
minster
to
no
not
to
peterborough
but
my
uncle
brand
is
abbot
there
they
tell
me
now
this
four
years
and
that
rogue
herluin
prior
in
his
he
is
dying
dying
of
a
broken
heart
like
me
and
the
frenchman
has
given
his
abbey
to
one
thorold
the
tyrant
of
malmesbury
a
frenchman
like
himself
no
take
me
where
i
shall
never
see
a
french
face
take
me
to
crowland
and
him
with
me
where
i
shall
see
naught
but
english
faces
and
hear
english
chants
and
die
a
free
englishwoman
under
guthlac
s
ah
said
hereward
bitterly
st
guthlac
is
a
right
englishman
and
will
have
some
sort
of
for
us
while
peter
of
course
is
somewhat
too
fond
of
rome
and
those
italian
monks
well
blood
is
thicker
than
water
so
i
hardly
blame
the
blessed
do
not
talk
so
much
the
saints
have
done
for
us
mother
that
we
are
to
be
so
very
respectful
to
their
high
mightinesses
i
fear
if
this
frenchman
goes
on
with
his
plan
of
thrusting
his
monks
into
our
abbeys
i
shall
have
to
do
more
even
for
guthlac
than
ever
he
did
for
me
do
not
say
more
mother
this
night
has
made
hereward
a
new
man
now
prepare
and
she
knew
what
he
meant
and
gather
all
your
treasures
and
we
will
start
for
crowland
chapter
xx
how
hereward
was
made
a
knight
after
the
fashion
of
the
english
a
wild
night
was
that
in
bourne
all
the
folk
free
and
unfree
man
and
woman
out
on
the
streets
asking
the
meaning
of
those
terrible
shrieks
followed
by
a
more
terrible
silence
at
last
hereward
strode
down
from
the
hall
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
silence
good
folks
and
hearken
to
me
once
for
all
there
is
not
a
frenchman
left
alive
in
bourne
if
you
be
the
men
i
take
you
for
there
shall
not
be
one
left
alive
between
wash
and
humber
silence
again
as
a
fierce
cry
of
rage
and
joy
arose
and
men
rushed
forward
to
take
him
by
the
hand
women
to
embrace
him
this
is
no
time
for
compliments
good
folks
but
for
quick
wit
and
quick
blows
for
the
law
we
fight
if
we
do
fight
and
by
the
law
we
must
work
fight
or
not
where
is
the
lawman
of
the
town

a
robber

crows

the
gates

wiser

will
follow

you
will
lead
hereward
is
come
home
cried
a
feeble
voice
behind
let
me
come
to
him
let
me
feel
and
through
the
crowd
supported
by
two
ladies
tottered
the
mighty
form
of
surturbrand
the
blind
viking
hereward
is
come
cried
he
as
he
folded
his
master
s
son
in
his
arms
hoi
he
is
wet
with
blood
hoi
he
smells
of
blood
hoi
the
ravens
will
grow
fat
now
for
hereward
is
come
home
some
would
have
led
the
old
man
away
but
he
thrust
them
off
fiercely
hoi
come
wolf
hoi
come
kite
hoi
come
erne
from
off

fen

and
we
fed
you
well
when
swend
forkbeard
brought
us
over
the
sea
follow
us
now
and
we
will
feed
you
better
still
with
the
mongrel
frenchers
who
scoff
at
the
tongue
of
their
forefathers
and
would
rob
their
nearest
kinsman
of
land
and
lass
hoi
swend
s
men
hoi
canute
s
men
vikings
sons
sons
berserkers
sons
all
split
up
the
and
send
it
round
and
the
curse
of
odin
on
every
man
that
will
not
pass
it
on
a
and
hildur
s
game
next
day
that
the
old
surturbrand
may
fall
like
a
freeholder
axe
in
hand
and
not
die
like
a
cow
in
the
straw
which
the
frenchman
has
spared
all
men
were
silent
as
the
old
viking
s
voice
cracked
and
feeble
when
he
began
gathered
strength
from
rage
till
it
rang
through
the
still
like
a
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
long
wild
cry
from
the
forest
which
made
the
women
start
and
catch
their
children
closer
to
them
it
was
the
howl
of
a
wolf
hark
to
the
witch
s
horse
hark
to
the
son
of
fenris
how
he
calls
for
meat
are
ye
your
fathers
sons
ye
men
of
bourne
they
never
let
the
gray
beast
call
in
hereward
saw
his
opportunity
and
seized
it
there
were
those
in
the
crowd
he
well
knew
as
there
must
needs
be
in
all
crowds
who
wished
themselves
well
out
of
the
business
who
shrank
from
the
thought
of
facing
the
norman
barons
much
more
the
norman
king
who
were
ready
enough
had
the
tide
of
feeling
begun
to
ebb
of
blaming
hereward
for
rashness
even
though
they
might
not
have
gone
so
far
as
to
give
him
up
to
the
normans
who
would
have
advised
some
sort
of
compromise
pacifying
or
other
weak
plan
for
escaping
present
danger
by
delivering
themselves
over
to
future
destruction
but
three
out
of
four
there
were
good
men
and
true
the
savage
chant
of
the
old
barbarian
might
have
startled
them
somewhat
for
they
were
tolerably
orthodox
christian
folk
but
there
was
sense
as
well
as
spirit
in
its
savageness
and
they
growled
applause
as
he
ceased
but
hereward
heard
and
cried
the
viking
is
right
so
speaks
the
spirit
of
our
fathers
and
we
must
show
ourselves
their
true
sons
send
round
the
and
death
to
the
man
who
does
not
pass
it
on
better
die
bravely
together
than
falter
and
part
company
to
be
hunted
down
one
by
one
by
men
who
will
never
forgive
us
as
long
as
we
have
an
acre
of
land
for
them
to
seize
perry
son
of
surturbrand
you
are
the
lawman
put
it
to
the
vote
send
round
the
shouted
perry
himself
and
if
there
was
a
man
or
two
who
shrank
from
the
proposal
they
found
it
prudent
to
shout
as
loudly
as
did
the
rest
ere
the
morning
light
the
was
split
into
four
splinters
and
carried
out
to
the
four
airts
through
all
kesteven
if
the
splinter
were
put
into
the
s
hand
he
must
send
it
on
at
once
to
the
next
freeman
s
house
if
he
were
away
it
was
stuck
into
his
or
into
his
great
chair
by
the
fireside
and
woe
to
him
if
on
his
return
he
sent
it
not
on
likewise
all
through
kesteven
went
that
night
the
and
with
them
the
whisper
hereward
is
come
again
and
before
midday
there
were
fifty
men
in
the
old
outside
the
town
and
hereward
haranguing
them
in
words
of
fire
a
chill
came
over
them
nevertheless
when
he
told
them
that
he
must
return
at
once
to
flanders
but
it
must
be
he
said
he
had
promised
his
good
lord
and
sovereign
baldwin
of
flanders
and
his
word
of
honor
he
must
keep
two
visits
he
must
pay
ere
he
went
and
then
to
sea
but
within
the
year
if
he
were
alive
on
ground
he
would
return
and
with
him
ships
and
men
it
might
be
with
sweyn
and
all
the
power
of
denmark
only
let
them
hold
their
own
till
the
danes
should
come
and
all
would
be
well
and
whenever
he
came
back
he
would
set
a
light
to
three
farms
that
stood
upon
a
hill
whence
they
could
be
seen
far
and
wide
over
the
bruneswold
and
over
all
the
fen
and
then
all
men
might
know
for
sure
that
hereward
was
come
again
and
of
them
says
the
chronicler
he
chose
to
guard
bourne
seemingly
the
lands
which
had
been
his
nephew
morcar
s
till
he
should
come
back
and
take
them
for
himself
godiva
s
lands
of
witham
toft
and
mainthorpe
gery
his
cousin
should
hold
till
his
return
and
send
what
he
could
off
them
to
his
mother
at
crowland
then
they
went
down
to
the
water
and
took
barge
and
laid
the
corpse
therein
and
godiva
and
hereward
sat
at
the
dead
lad
s
head
and
winter
steered
the
boat
and
gwenoch
took
the
and
they
rowed
away
for
crowland
by
many
a
mere
and
many
an
ea
through
narrow
reaches
of
clear
brown
glassy
water
between
the
alders
between
the
reeds
where
the
coot
clanked
and
the
bittern
boomed
and
the
not
content
with
its
own
sweet
song
mocked
the
song
of
all
the
birds
around
and
then
out
into
the
broad
lagoons
where
hung
motionless
high
overhead
hawk
beyond
hawk
buzzard
beyond
buzzard
kite
beyond
kite
as
far
as
eye
could
see
into
the
air
as
they
rowed
on
whirred
up
the
great
skeins
of
wild
fowl
innumerable
with
a
cry
as
of
all
the
bells
of
crowland
or
all
the
hounds
of
bruneswold
and
clear
above
all
the
noise
sounded
the
wild
whistle
of
the
curlews
and
the
of
the
great
white
swan
out
of
the
reeds
like
an
arrow
shot
the
peregrine
singled
one
luckless
mallard
from
the
flock
caught
him
up
struck
him
stone
dead
with
one
blow
of
his
terrible
heel
and
swept
his
prey
with
him
into
the
reeds
again
death
death
death
said
lady
godiva
as
the
feathers
fluttered
down
into
the
boat
and
rested
on
the
dead
boy
s
pall
war
among
man
and
beast
war
on
earth
war
in
air
war
in
the
water
beneath
as
a
great
pike
rolled
at
his
bait
sending
a
shoal
of
white
fish
flying
along
the
surface
and
war
says
holy
writ
in
heaven
above
o
thou
who
didst
die
to
destroy
death
when
will
it
all
be
over
and
thus
they
glided
on
from
stream
to
stream
until
they
came
to
the
sacred
isle
of
the
inheritance
of
the
lord
the
soil
of
mary
and
bartholomew
the
most
holy
sanctuary
of
guthlac
and
his
monks
the
minster
most
free
from
worldly
servitude
the
special
almshouse
of
the
most
illustrious
kings
the
sole
place
of
refuge
for
any
one
in
all
tribulations
the
perpetual
abode
of
the
saints
the
possession
of
religious
men
especially
set
apart
by
the
common
council
of
the
kingdom
by
reason
of
the
frequent
miracles
of
the
most
holy
confessor
an
ever
fruitful
mother
of
camphire
in
the
vineyards
of
engedi
and
by
reason
of
the
privileges
granted
by
the
kings
a
city
of
grace
and
safety
to
all
who
as
they
drew
near
they
passed
every
minute
some
fisher
s
log
canoe
in
which
worked
with
net
or
line
the
criminal
who
had
saved
his
life
by
fleeing
to
guthlac
and
becoming
his
man
henceforth
the
slave
who
had
fled
from
his
master
s
cruelty
and
here
and
there
in
those
evil
days
the
master
who
had
fled
from
the
cruelty
of
normans
who
would
have
done
to
him
as
he
had
done
to
others
but
all
old
grudges
were
put
away
there
they
had
sought
the
peace
of
guthlac
and
therefore
they
must
keep
his
peace
and
get
their
living
from
the
fish
of
the
five
rivers
within
the
bounds
whereof
was
peace
as
of
their
own
quiet
streams
for
the
abbot
and
guthlac
were
the
only
lords
thereof
and
neither
summoner
nor
sheriff

the
king
nor

force
of
knight
or
earl

enter

they
came

a
vast
range
of
buildings
founded
on
piles
of

up
a

with
narrow
windows
and
leaden
roofs
and
above
all
the
great
wooden
tower
from
which
on
high
days
chimed
out
the
melody
of
the
seven
famous
bells
which
had
not
their
like
in
english
land
guthlac
bartholomew
and

the

of
the

of

saw
them

few
years
after
pouring

his
own
head
in

of
melted
metal

the

of

beyond
them
again
the
natural
park
of
grass
dotted
with
mighty
oaks
and
ashes
and
beyond
all
those
cornlands
of
inexhaustible
fertility
broken
up
by
the
good
abbot
egelric
some
hundred
years
before
from
which
in
times
of
dearth
the
monks
of
crowland
fed
the
people
of
all
the
neighboring
fens
they
went
into
the

all

were
busy
baking

brewing
carpentering

tailoring
in

praying

singing
in

fifty
years
old

where
they
would
or
basked
against
a
sunny
wall
like
autumn
flies
with
each
a
young
monk
to
guide
him
and
listen
to
his
tattle
of
old
days
for

of

with
the
greatest
peace

tranquillity
they
shall
await

raged

of

of

and
lady
godiva
called
for
old
abbot
ulfketyl
the
good
and
brave
and
fell
upon
his
neck
and
told
him
all
her
tale
and
ulfketyl
wept
upon
her
neck
for
they
were
old
and
faithful
friends
and
they
passed
into
the
dark
cool
church
where
in
the
crypt
under
the
high
altar
lay
the
thumb
of
bartholomew
which
old
abbot
turketul
used
to
carry
about
that
he
might
cross
himself
with
it
in
times
of
danger
tempest
and
lightning
and
some
of
the
hair
of
mary
queen
of
heaven
in
a
box
of
gold
and
a
bone
of
leodegar
of
aquitaine
and
some
few
remains
too
of
the
holy
bodies
of
guthlac
and
of
bettelm
his
servant
and
tatwin
who
steered
him
to
crowland
and
egbert
his
confessor
and
cissa
the
anchorite
and
of
the
most
holy
virgin
etheldreda
and
many
more
but
little
of
them
remained
since
sigtryg
and
bagsac
s
heathen
danes
had
heaped
them
pellmell
on
the
floor
and
burned
the
church
over
them
and
the
bodies
of
the
slaughtered
monks
the
plunder
which
was
taken
from
crowland
on
that
evil
day
lay
and
lies
still
with
the
plunder
of
peterborough
and
many
a
minster
more
at
the
bottom
of
the
nene
at
huntingdon
bridge
but
it
had
been
more
than
replaced
by
the
piety
of
the
danish
kings
and
nobles
and
above
the
twelve
white
bearskins
which
lay
at
the
twelve
altars
blazed
in
the
light
of
many
a
wax
candle
gold
and
jewels
inferior
only
to
those
of
peterborough
and
coventry
and
there
in
the
nave
they
buried
the
lad
godwin
with
chant
and
dirge
and
when
the
funeral
was
done
hereward
went
up
toward
the
high
altar
and
bade
winter
and
gwenoch
come
with
him
and
there
he
knelt
and
vowed
a
vow
to
god
and
guthlac
and
the
lady
torfrida
his
true
love
never
to
leave
from
slaying
while
there
was
a
frenchman
left
alive
on
english
ground
and
godiva
and
ulfketyl
heard
his
vow
and
shuddered
but
they
dared
not
stop
him
for
they
too
had
english
hearts
and
winter
and
gwenoch
heard
it
and
repeated
it
word
for
word
then
he
kissed
his
mother
and
called
winter
and
gwenoch
and
went
forth
he
would
be
back
again
he
said
on
the
third
day
then
those
three
went
to
peterborough
and
asked
for
abbot
brand
and
the
monks
let
them
in
for
the
fame
of
their
deed
had
passed
through
the
forest
and
all
the
french
had
fled
and
old
brand
lay
back
in
his
great
his
legs
all
muffled
up
in
furs
for
he
could
get
no
heat
and
by
him
stood
herluin
the
prior
and
wondered
when
he
would
die
and
thorold
take
his
place
and
they
should
drive
out
the
old
gregorian
chants
from
the
choir
and
have
the
new
norman
chants
of
robert
of
fécamp
and
bring
in
customs
in
all
things
and
rule
the
english
boors
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
old
brand
knew
all
that
was
in
his
heart
and
looked
up
like
a
patient
ox
beneath
the
butcher
s
axe
and
said
have
patience
with
me
brother
herluin
and
i
will
die
as
soon
as
i
can
and
go
where
there
is
neither
french
nor
english
jew
nor
gentile
bond
or
free
but
all
are
alike
in
the
eyes
of
him
who
made
but
when
he
saw
hereward
come
in
he
cast
the
mufflers
off
him
and
sprang
up
from
his
chair
and
was
young
and
strong
in
a
moment
and
for
a
moment
and
he
threw
his
arms
round
hereward
and
wept
upon
his
neck
as
his
mother
had
done
and
hereward
wept
upon
his
neck
though
he
had
not
wept
upon
his
mother
s
then
brand
held
him
at
arms
length
or
thought
he
held
him
for
he
was
leaning
on
hereward
and
tottering
all
the
while
and
extolled
him
as
the
champion
the
warrior
the
stay
of
his
house
the
avenger
of
his
kin
the
hero
of
whom
he
had
always
prophesied
that
his
kin
would
need
him
and
that
then
he
would
not
fail
but
hereward
answered
him
modestly
and
mildly
speak
not
so
to
me
and
of
me
uncle
brand
i
am
a
very
foolish
vain
sinful
man
who
have
come
through
great
adventures
i
know
not
how
to
great
and
strange
happiness
and
now
again
to
great
and
strange
sorrows
and
to
an
adventure
greater
and
stranger
than
all
that
has
befallen
me
from
my
youth
up
until
now
therefore
make
me
not
proud
uncle
brand
but
keep
me
modest
and
lowly
as
befits
all
true
knights
and
penitent
sinners
for
they
tell
me
that
god
resists
the
proud
and
giveth
grace
to
the
humble
and
i
have
that
to
do
which
do
i
can
not
unless
god
and
his
saints
give
me
grace
from
this
day
brand
looked
at
him
astonished
and
then
turned
to
herluin
did
i
not
tell
thee
prior
this
is
the
lad
whom
you
called
graceless
and
a
savage
and
see
since
he
has
been
in
foreign
lands
and
seen
the
ways
of
knights
he
talks
as
clerkly
as
a
frenchman
and
as
piously
as
any
the
lord
hereward
said
herluin
has
doubtless
learned
much
from
the
manners
of
our
nation
which
he
would
not
have
learned
in
england
i
rejoice
to
see
him
returned
so
christian
and
so
courtly
a
the
lord
hereward
prior
herluin
has
learnt
one
thing
in
his
travels
to
know
somewhat
of
men
and
the
hearts
of
men
and
to
deal
with
them
as
they
deserve
of
him
they
tell
me
that
one
thorold
of
malmesbury
thorold
of
fécamp
the
minstrel
he
that
made
the
song
of
rowland
that
he
desires
this
i
have
so
heard
my
then
i
command
i
hereward
lord
of
bourne
that
this
abbey
be
held
against
him
and
all
frenchmen
in
the
name
of
swend
ulfsson
king
of
england
and
of
me
and
he
that
admits
a
frenchman
therein
i
will
shave
his
crown
for
him
so
well
that
he
shall
never
need
razor
more
this
i
tell
thee
and
this
i
shall
tell
your
monks
before
i
go
and
unless
you
obey
the
same
my
dream
will
be
fulfilled
and
you
will
see
goldenbregh
in
a
light
low
and
burning
yourselves
in
the
midst
swend
ulfsson
swend
of
denmark
what
words
are
these
cried
brand
you
will
know
within
six
months
i
shall
know
better
things
my
boy
before
six
months
are
uncle
uncle
do
not
say
why
not
if
this
mortal
life
be
at
best
a
prison
and
a
grave
what
is
it
worth
now
to
an
englishman
more
than
ever
for
never
had
an
englishman
such
a
chance
of
showing
english
mettle
and
winning
renown
for
the
english
name
uncle
you
must
do
something
for
me
and
my
comrades
ere
we
well
boy
make
us
knights
lad
i
thought
you
had
been
a
belted
knight
this
dozen
years
i
might
have
been
made
a
knight
by
many
after
the
french
fashion
many
a
year
agone
i
might
have
been
knight
when
i
slew
the
white
bear
ladies
have
prayed
me
to
be
knighted
again
and
again
since
something
kept
me
from
it
perhaps
with
a
glance
at
herluin
i
wanted
to
show
that
an
english
squire
could
be
the
rival
and
the
leader
of
french
and
flemish
and
thou
hast
shown
it
brave
lad
said
brand
clapping
his
great
hands
perhaps
i
longed
to
do
some
mighty
deed
at
last
which
would
give
me
a
right
to
go
to
the
bravest
knight
in
all
christendom
and
say
give
me
the
accolade
then
thou
only
art
worthy
to
knight
as
good
a
man
as
pride
and
vainglory
said
brand
shaking
his
head
but
now
i
am
of
a
sounder
mind
i
see
now
why
i
was
kept
from
being
knighted
till
i
had
done
a
deed
worthy
of
a
true
knight
till
i
had
mightily
avenged
the
wronged
and
mightily
succored
the
oppressed
till
i
had
purged
my
soul
of
my
enmity
against
my
own
kin
and
could
go
out
into
the
world
a
new
man
with
my
mother
s
blessing
on
my
but
not
of
the
robbery
of
peter
said
herluin
the
french
monk
wanted
not
for
moral
courage
no
french
monk
did
in
those
days
and
he
proved
it
by
those
words
do
not
anger
the
lad
prior
now
too
above
all
times
when
his
heart
is
softened
toward
the
he
has
not
angered
me
the
man
is
right
here
lord
abbot
and
sir
prior
is
a
chain
of
gold
won
in
the
wars
it
is
worth
fifty
times
the
sixteen
pence
which
i
stole
and
which
i
repaid
double
let
peter
take
it
for
the
sins
of
me
and
my
two
comrades
and
forgive
and
now
sir
prior
i
do
to
thee
what
i
never
did
for
mortal
man
i
kneel
and
ask
thy
forgiveness
kneel
winter
kneel
gwenoch
and
hereward
knelt
herluin
was
of
double
mind
he
longed
to
keep
hereward
out
of
peter
s
grace
he
longed
to
see
hereward
dead
at
his
feet
not
because
of
any
personal
hatred
but
because
he
foresaw
in
him
a
terrible
foe
to
the
norman
cause
but
he
wished
too
to
involve
abbot
brand
as
much
as
possible
in
hereward
s
rebellions
and
misdeeds
and
above
all
in
the
of
knighting
him
for
for
that
end
he
saw
hereward
was
come
moreover
he
was
touched
with
the
sudden
frankness
and
humility
of
the
famous
champion
so
he
answered
mildly
verily
thou
hast
a
knightly
soul
may
god
and
peter
so
forgive
thee
and
thy
companions
as
i
forgive
thee
freely
and
from
my
now
cried
hereward
a
boon
a
boon
knight
me
and
these
my
fellows
uncle
brand
this
brand
was
old
and
weak
and
looked
at
herluin
i
know
said
hereward
that
the
french
look
on
us
english
knights
as
spurious
and
adulterine
unworthy
of
the
name
of
knight
but
i
hold
and
what
churchman
will
gainsay
me
that
it
is
nobler
to
receive
sword
and
belt
from
a
man
of
god
than
from
a
man
of
blood
like
one
s
self
the
fittest
to
consecrate
the
soldier
of
an
earthly
king
is
the
soldier
of
christ
the
king

then
this
night
you
shall

in
the
church
after
the
gospel
the
thing
shall
be
done
as
you
that
night
two
messengers
knights
of
the
abbot
galloped
from
peterborough
one
to
ivo
taillebois
at
spalding
to
tell
him
that
hereward
was
at
peterborough
and
that
he
must
try
to
cut
him
off
upon
the
egelric
s
road
the
causeway
which
one
of
the
many
abbots
egelric
had
made
some
thirty
years
before
through
deeping
fen
to
spalding
at
an
enormous
expense
of
labor
and
of
timber
the
other
knight
rode
south
along
the
roman
road
to
london
to
tell
king
william
of
the
rising
of
kesteven
and
all
the
evil
deeds
of
hereward
and
of
brand
and
old
brand
slept
quietly
in
his
bed
little
thinking
on
what
errands
his
prior
had
sent
his
knights
hereward
and
his
comrades
watched
that
night
in
peter
s
church
oppressed
with
weariness
of
body
and
awe
of
mind
they
heard
the
monks
drone
out
their
chants
through
the
misty
gloom
they
confessed
the
sins
and
they
were
many
of
their
past
wild
lives
they
had
to
summon
up
within
themselves
courage
and
strength
henceforth
to
live
not
for
themselves
but
for
the
fatherland
which
they
hoped
to
save
they
prayed
to
all
the
heavenly
powers
of
that
pantheon
which
then
stood
between
man
and
god
to
help
them
in
the
coming
struggle
but
ere
the
morning
dawned
they
were
nodding
unused
to
any
long
strain
of
mind
suddenly
hereward
started
and
sprang
up
with
a
cry
of
fire
what
where
cried
his
comrades
and
the
monks
who
ran
up
the
minster
is
full
of
flame
no
use
too
late
you
can
not
put
it
out
it
must
you
have
been
dreaming
said
one
i
have
not
said
hereward
is
it
lammas
night
what
a
question
it
is
the
vigil
of
the
nativity
of
peter
and
thank
heaven
i
thought
my
old
lammas
night
s
dream
was
coming
true
at
herluin
heard
and
knew
what
he
meant
after
which
hereward
was
silent
filled
with
many
thoughts
the
next
morning
before
the
high
mass
those
three
brave
men
walked
up
to
the
altar
laid
thereon
their
belts
and
swords
and
then
knelt
humbly
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
till
the
gospel
was
finished
then
came
down
from
the
altar
wilton
of
ely
and
laid
on
each
man
s
bare
neck
the
bare
blade
and
bade
him
take
back
his
sword
in
the
name
of
god
and
of
peter
and
paul
and
use
it
like
a
true
knight
for
a
terror
and
punishment
to
and
a
defence
for
women
and
orphans
and
the
poor
and
the
oppressed
and
the
monks
the
servants
of
god
and
then
the
monks
girded
each
man
with
his
belt
and
sword
once
more
and
after
mass
was
sung
they
rose
and
went
forth
each
feeling
himself
and
surely
not
in
vain
a
better
man
at
least
this
is
certain
that
hereward
would
say
to
his
dying
day
how
he
had
often
proved
that
none
would
fight
so
well
as
those
who
had
received
their
sword
from
god
s
knights
the
monks
and
therefore
he
would
have
in
after
years
almost
all
his
companions
knighted
by
the
monks
and
brought
into
ely
with
him
that
same
good
custom
which
he
had
learnt
at
peterborough
and
kept
it
up
as
long
as
he
held
the
isle
so
says
the
chronicler
leofric
the
minstrel
and
priest
it
was
late
when
they
got
back
to
crowland
the
good
abbot
received
them
with
a
troubled
face
as
i
feared
my
lord
you
have
been
too
hot
and
hasty
the
french
have
raised
the
country
against
i
have
raised
it
against
them
my
lord
but
we
have
news
that
sir
frederick
and
who
may
he
be
a
very
terrible
goliath
of
these
french
old
and
crafty
a
brother
of
old
earl
warrenne
of
norfolk
whom
god
confound
and
he
has
sworn
to
have
your
life
and
has
gathered
knights
and
at
lynn
in
very
good
i
will
visit
him
as
i
go
home
lord
abbot
not
a
word
of
this
to
any
i
tremble
for
thee
thou
young
one
can
not
live
forever
my
lord
a
week
after
a
boatman
brought
news
to
crowland
how
sir
frederick
was
sitting
in
his
inn
at
lynn
when
there
came
in
one
with
a
sword
and
said
i
am
hereward
i
was
told
that
thou
didst
desire
greatly
to
see
me
therefore
i
am
come
being
a
courteous
knight
and
therewith
smote
off
his
head
and
when
the
knights
and
others
would
have
stopped
him
he
cut
his
way
through
them
killing
some
three
or
four
at
each
stroke
himself
unhurt
for
he
was
clothed
from
head
to
foot
in
magic
armor
and
whosoever
smote
it
their
swords
melted
in
their
hands
and
so
gaining
the
door
he
vanished
in
a
great
cloud
of
that
cried
forever
hereward
is
come
home
again
and
after
that
the
said
to
each
other
that
all
the
birds
upon
the
meres
cried
nothing
save
hereward
is
come
home
again
and
so
already
surrounded
with
myth
and
mystery
hereward
flashed
into
the
fens
and
out
again
like
the
lightning
brand
destroying
as
he
passed
and
the
hearts
of
all
the
french
were
turned
to
water
and
the
land
had
peace
from
its
tyrants
for
many
days
chapter
xxi
how
ivo
taillebois
marched
out
of
spalding
town
a
proud
man
was
ivo
taillebois
as
he
rode
next
morning
out
of
spalding
town
with
hawk
on
fist
and
hound
at
heel
and
a
dozen
at
his
back
who
would
on
due
or
undue
cause
shown
hunt
men
while
he
hunted
game
an
adventurer
from
anjou
brutal
ignorant
and
profligate
too
for
his
own
men
whispered
behind
his
back
that
he
was
no
more
than
his
name
hinted
a
s
son
he
still
had
his
deserts
valiant
he
was
cunning
and
skilled
in
war
he
and
his
troop
of
angevine
ruttiers
had
fought
like
tigers
by
william
s
side
at
hastings
and
he
had
been
rewarded
with
many
a
manor
which
had
been
earl
algar
s
and
should
now
have
been
earl
edwin
s
or
morcar
s
or
it
may
be
hereward
s
own
a
fat
land
and
fair
said
he
to
himself
and
after
i
have
hanged
a
few
more
of
these
barbarians
a
peaceful
fief
enough
to
hand
down
to
the
lawful
heirs
of
my
body
if
i
had
one
i
must
marry
blessed
virgin
this
it
is
to
serve
and
honor
your
gracious
majesty
as
i
have
always
done
according
to
my
poor
humility
who
would
have
thought
that
ivo
taillebois
would
ever
rise
so
high
in
life
as
to
be
looking
out
for
a
wife
and
that
a
lady
too
then
thought
he
over
the
peerless
beauties
of
the
lady
lucia
edwin
and
morcar
s
sister
almost
as
fair
as
that
hapless
aunt
of
hers
first
married
though
that
story
is
now
denied
to
the
wild
griffin
prince
of
snowdon
and
then
to
his
conqueror
and
by
complicity
murderer
harold
the
hapless
king
eddeva
faira
eddeva
pulcra
stands
her
name
in
even
now
known
even
to
her
norman
conquerors
as
the
beauty
of
her
time
as
godiva
her
mother
had
been
before
her
scarcely
less
beautiful
was
lucia
as
ivo
had
seen
her
at
william
s
court
half
captive
and
half
guest
and
he
longed
for
her
love
her
he
could
not
i
have
her
father
s
lands
quoth
he
what
more
reasonable
than
to
have
the
daughter
too
and
have
her
i
will
unless
the
mamzer
in
his
present
merciful
and
politic
mood
makes
a
countess
of
her
and
marries
her
up
to
some
norman
coxcomb
with
a
long
pedigree
invented
the
year
before
last
if
he
does
throw
away
his
daughter
on
that
earl
edwin
in
his
fancy
for
petting
and
patting
these
savages
into
good
humor
he
is
not
likely
to
throw
away
edwin
s
sister
on
a
taillebois
well
i
must
put
a
spoke
in
edwin
s
wheel
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
make
him
or
morcar
or
both
of
them
traitors
we
must
have
a
rebellion
in
these
parts
i
will
talk
about
it
to
gilbert
of
ghent
we
must
make
these
savages
desperate
and
william
furious
or
he
will
be
soon
giving
them
back
their
lands
beside
asking
them
to
court
and
then
how
are
valiant
knights
like
us
who
have
won
england
for
him
to
be
paid
for
their
trouble
no
no
we
must
have
a
rebellion
and
a
confiscation
and
then
when
english
lasses
are
going
cheap
perhaps
the
lady
lucia
may
fall
to
my
and
ivo
taillebois
kept
his
word
and
without
difficulty
for
he
had
many
to
help
him
to
drive
the
english
to
desperation
and
get
a
pretext
for
seizing
their
lands
was
the
game
which
the
normans
played
and
but
too
well
as
he
rode
out
of
spalding
town
a
man
was
being
hanged
on
the
gallows
there
permanently
provided
that
was
so
common
a
sight
that
ivo
would
not
have
stopped
had
not
a
priest
who
was
comforting
the
criminal
ran
forward
and
almost
thrown
himself
under
the
horse
s
feet
mercy
good
my
lord
in
the
name
of
god
and
all
his
saints
ivo
went
to
ride
on
mercy
and
he
laid
hands
on
ivo
s
bridle
if
he
took
a
few
pike
out
of
your
mere
remember
that
the
mere
was
his
and
his
father
s
before
him
and
do
not
send
a
sorely
tempted
soul
out
of
the
world
for
a
paltry
and
where
am
i
to
get
fish
for
lent
sir
priest
if
every
rascal
nets
my
waters
because
his
father
did
so
before
him
take
your
hand
off
my
bridle
or
par
le
splendeur
dex
ivo
thought
it
fine
to
use
king
william
s
favorite
oath
i
will
hew
it
off
the
priest
looked
at
him
with
something
of
honest
english
fierceness
in
his
eyes
and
dropping
the
bridle
muttered
to
himself
in
latin
the
bloodthirsty
and
deceitful
man
shall
not
live
out
half
his
days
nevertheless
my
trust
shall
be
in
thee
o
lord
what
art
muttering
beast
go
home
to
thy
wife
wife
was
by
no
means
the
word
which
ivo
used
and
make
the
most
of
her
before
i
rout
out
thee
and
thy
and
put
in
good
monks
from
normandy
in
the
place
of
your
drunken
english
swine
hang
him
shouted
he
as
the
fell
on
their
knees
before
the
tyrant
crouching
in
terror
every
woman
for
her
husband
every
man
for
wife
and
daughter
and
hearken
you
all
who
touches
pike
or
eel
swimming
or
wading
fowl
within
these
meres
of
mine
without
my
leave
i
will
hang
him
as
i
hanged
this
man
as
i
hanged
four
brothers
in
a
row
on
wrokesham
bridge
but
go
to
wrokesham
bridge
and
see
shouted
a
shrill
cracked
voice
from
behind
the
crowd
all
looked
round
and
more
than
one
of
ivo
s
men
set
up
a
yell
the
hangman
loudest
of
all
that
s
he
the
heron
again
catch
him
stop
him
shoot
him
but
that
was
not
so
easy
as
ivo
pushed
his
horse
through
the
crowd
careless
of
whom
he
crushed
he
saw
a
long
lean
figure
flying
through
the
air
seven
feet
aloft
with
his
heels
higher
than
his
head
on
the
further
side
of
a
deep
broad
ditch
and
on
the
nearer
side
of
the
same
one
of
his
best
men
lying
stark
with
a
cloven
skull
go
to
wrokesham
shrieked
the
lean
man
as
he
rose
and
showed
a
ridiculously
long
nose
neck
and
legs
a
type
still
not
uncommon
in
the
fens
a
quilted
leather
coat
a
axe
slung
over
his
shoulder
by
a
thong
a
round
shield
at
his
back
and
a
pole
three
times
as
long
as
himself
which
he
dragged
after
him
like
an
unwieldy
tail
the
heron
the
heron
shouted
the
english
follow
him
men
heron
or
hawk
shouted
ivo
galloping
his
horse
up
to
the
ditch
and
stopping
short
at
fifteen
feet
of
water
shoot
some
one
where
are
the
bows
gone
the
heron
was
gone
two
hundred
yards
running
in
spite
of
his
pole
at
a
wonderful
pace
before
a
bow
could
be
brought
to
bear
he
seemed
to
expect
an
arrow
for
he
stopped
glanced
his
eye
round
threw
himself
flat
on
his
face
with
his
shield
not
over
his
body
but
over
his
bare
legs
sprang
up
as
the
shaft
stuck
in
the
ground
beside
him
ran
on
planted
his
pole
in
the
next
dike
and
flew
over
it
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
beyond
pursuit
and
ivo
turned
breathless
with
rage
to
ask
who
he
was
alas
sir
he
is
the
man
who
set
free
the
four
men
at
wrokesham
bridge
last
set
free
are
they
not
hanged
and
dead
we
we
dared
not
tell
you
but
he
came
upon
us
you
cowards
sir
he
is
not
a
man
but
a
witch
or
a
devil
he
asked
us
what
we
did
there
one
of
our
men
laughed
at
his
long
neck
and
legs
and
called
him
heron
heron
i
am
says
he
and
strike
like
a
heron
right
at
the
eyes
and
with
that
he
cuts
the
man
over
the
face
with
his
axe
and
laid
him
dead
and
then
another
and
till
you
all
ran
away
villains
we
gave
back
a
step
no
more
and
he
freed
one
of
those
four
and
he
again
the
rest
and
then
they
all
set
on
us
and
went
to
hang
us
in
their
own
when
there
were
ten
of
you
i
thought
sir
as
we
told
you
he
is
no
mortal
man
but
a
beasts
fools
well
i
have
hanged
this
one
at
least
growled
ivo
and
then
rode
sullenly
on
who
is
this
fellow
cried
he
to
the
trembling
english
wulfric
raher
wulfric
the
heron
of
wrokesham
in
aha
and
i
hold
a
manor
of
his
said
ivo
to
himself
look
you
villains
this
fellow
is
in
league
with
a
burst
of
abject
denial
followed
since
the
french
since
sir
frederick
as
they
call
him
drove
him
out
of
his
wrokesham
lands
he
wanders
the
country
as
you
see
here
but
heaven
only
knows
where
he
will
be
and
finds
of
course
a
friend
everywhere
now
march
and
a
string
of
threats
and
curses
followed
it
was
hard
to
see
why
wulfric
should
not
have
found
friends
as
he
was
simply
a
small
holder
or
squire
driven
out
of
house
and
land
and
turned
adrift
on
the
wide
world
for
the
offence
of
having
fought
in
harold
s
army
at
the
battle
of
hastings
but
to
give
him
food
or
shelter
was
in
norman
eyes
an
act
of
rebellion
against
the
rightful
king
william
and
ivo
rode
on
boiling
over
with
righteous
indignation
along
the
narrow
drove
which
led
toward
deeping
a
pretty
lass
came
along
the
drove
driving
a
few
sheep
before
her
and
spinning
as
she
walked
whose
lass
are
you
shouted
ivo
the
abbot
of
crowland
s
please
your
lordship
said
she
trembling
much
too
pretty
to
belong
to
monks
chuck
her
up
behind
you
one
of
the
shrieking
and
struggling
girl
was
mounted
behind
a
horseman
and
bound
and
ivo
rode
on
a
woman
ran
out
of
a
on
the
drove
side
attracted
by
the
girl
s
cries
it
was
her
mother
my
lass
give
me
my
lass
for
the
love
of
mary
and
all
saints
and
she
clung
to
ivo
s
bridle
he
struck
her
down
and
rode
on
over
her
a
man
cutting
sedges
in
a
punt
in
the
lode
alongside
looked
up
at
the
girl
s
shrieks
and
leapt
on
shore
scythe
in
hand
father
father
cried
she
i
ll
rid
thee
lass
or
die
for
it
said
he
as
he
sprang
up
the
and
swept
right
and
left
at
the
horses
legs
the
men
recoiled
one
horse
went
down
lamed
for
life
another
staggered
backwards
into
the
further
lode
and
was
drowned
but
an
arrow
went
through
the
brave
serf
s
heart
and
ivo
rode
on
cursing
more
bitterly
than
ever
and
comforted
himself
by
flying
his
hawks
at
a
covey
of
patridges
soon
a
group
came
along
the
drove
which
promised
fresh
sport
to
the
but
as
the
foremost
person
came
up
ivo
stopped
in
wonder
at
the
shout
of
ivo
ivo
taillebois
halt
and
have
a
care
the
english
are
risen
and
we
are
all
dead
men
the
words
were
spoken
in
french
and
in
french
ivo
answered
laughing
thou
art
not
a
dead
man
yet
it
seems
sir
robert
art
going
on
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
that
thou
comest
in
this
fashion
or
dost
mean
to
return
to
anjou
as
bare
as
thou
camest
out
of
it
for
sir
robert
had
like
edgar
in
shakespear
s
reserved
himself
a
blanket
else
had
we
all
been
but
very
little
more
did
either
he
his
lady
and
his
three
children
wear
as
they
trudged
along
the
drove
in
even
poorer
case
than
that
robert
of
coningsby
who
came
out
of
normandy
with
his
wife
tiffany
and
his
maid
maupas
and
his
dog
hardigras
for
the
love
of
heaven
and
all
chivalry
joke
me
no
jokes
sir
ivo
but
give
me
and
mine
clothes
and
food
the
barbarians
rose
on
us
last
night
with
azer
the
ruffian
who
owned
my
lands
at
their
head
and
drove
us
out
into
the
night
as
we
are
bidding
us
carry
the
news
to
you
for
your
turn
would
come
next
there
are
forty
or
more
of
them
in
west
deeping
now
and
coming
eastward
they
say
to
visit
you
and
what
is
more
than
all
hereward
is
come
hereward
cried
ivo
who
knew
that
name
well
whereon
sir
robert
told
him
the
terrible
tragedy
of
bourne
mount
the
lady
on
a
horse
and
wrap
her
in
my
cloak
get
that
dead
villain
s
clothes
for
sir
robert
as
we
go
back
put
your
horses
heads
about
and
ride
for
what
shall
we
do
with
the
lass
we
can
not
be
burdened
with
the
jade
she
has
cost
us
two
good
horses
already
leave
her
in
the
road
bound
as
she
is
and
let
us
see
if
guthlac
her
master
will
come
and
untie
so
they
rode
back
coming
from
deeping
two
hours
after
azer
and
his
men
found
the
girl
on
the
road
dead
another
count
in
the
long
score
quoth
azer
but
when
in
two
hours
more
they
came
to
spalding
town
they
found
all
the
folk
upon
the
street
shouting
and
praising
the
host
of
heaven
there
was
not
a
frenchman
left
in
the
town
for
when
ivo
returned
home
ere
yet
sir
robert
and
his
family
were
well
clothed
and
fed
there
galloped
into
spalding
from
the
north
sir
ascelin
nephew
and
man
of
thorold
abbot
of
peterborough
and
one
of
the
garrison
of
lincoln
which
was
then
held
by
hereward
s
old
friend
gilbert
of
ghent
not
bad
news
i
hope
cried
ivo
as
ascelin
clanked
into
the
hall
we
have
enough
of
our
own
here
is
all
kesteven
as
the
barbarians
call
it
risen
and
they
are
murdering
us
right
and
worse
news
than
that
ivo
taillebois
sir
or
sieur
ascelin
was
loath
to
call
him
being
himself
a
man
of
family
and
fashion
and
holding
the
in
deep
contempt
worse
news
than
that
the
north
has
risen
again
and
proclaimed
prince
edgar
a
king
of
words
what
care
i
or
you
as
long
as
the
mamzer
god
bless
him
is
a
king
of
deeds
they
have
done
their
deeds
though
too
gospatrick
and
marlesweyn
are
back
out
of
scotland
they
attacked
robert
de
comines
footnote
ancestor
of
the
comyns
of
scotland
at
durham
and
burnt
him
in
his
own
house
there
was
but
one
of
his
men
got
out
of
durham
to
tell
the
news
and
now
they
have
marched
on
york
and
all
the
chiefs
they
say
have
joined
them
archill
the
thane
and
edwin
and
morcar
and
waltheof
too
the
young
blessed
virgin
cried
ivo
thou
art
indeed
gracious
to
thy
most
unworthy
knight
what
do
you
mean
you
will
see
some
day
now
i
will
tell
you
but
one
word
when
fools
make
hay
wise
men
can
build
ricks
this
rebellion
if
it
had
not
come
of
itself
i
would
have
roused
it
we
wanted
it
to
cure
william
of
this
just
and
benevolent
policy
of
his
which
would
have
ended
in
sending
us
back
to
france
as
poor
as
we
left
it
now
what
am
i
expected
to
do
what
says
gilbert
of
ghent
the
wise
man
of
lic
nic
what
the
pest
do
you
call
that
outlandish
place
which
no
civilized
lips
can
pronounce
replied
ascelin
who
like
the
rest
of
the
french
never
could
manage
to
say
lincoln
he
says
march
to
me
and
with
me
to
join
the
king
at
then
he
says
well
these
fat
acres
will
be
none
the
leaner
if
i
leave
the
english
slaves
to
crop
them
for
six
months
men
arm
and
horse
sir
robert
of
deeping
then
arm
and
horse
yourselves
we
march
north
in
half
an
hour
bag
and
baggage
scrip
and
scrippage
you
are
all
bachelors
like
me
and
travel
light
so
off
with
you
sir
ascelin
you
will
eat
and
drink
that
will
quick
then
butler
and
after
that
pack
up
the
englishman
s
which
we
inherited
by
right
of
fist
the
only
plate
and
the
only
i
ever
now
sir
ascelin
as
the
three
knights
the
lady
and
the
poor
children
ate
their
fastest
listen
to
me
the
art
of
war
lies
in
this
one
nutshell
to
put
the
greatest
number
of
men
into
one
place
at
one
time
and
let
all
other
places
shift
to
strike
swiftly
and
strike
heavily
that
is
the
rule
of
our
liege
lord
king
william
and
by
it
he
will
conquer
england
or
the
world
if
he
will
and
while
he
does
that
he
shall
never
say
that
ivo
taillebois
stayed
at
home
to
guard
his
own
manors
while
he
could
join
his
king
and
win
all
the
manors
of
england
once
and
for
pardieu
whatever
men
may
say
of
thy
lineage
or
thy
virtues
they
can
not
deny
this
that
thou
art
a
most
wise
and
valiant
that
am
i
quoth
taillebois
too
much
pleased
with
the
praise
to
care
about
being
by
younger
men
as
for
my
lineage
my
lord
the
king
has
a
for
upstarts
and
the
woodman
s
grandson
may
very
well
serve
the
tanner
s
now
men
is
the
litter
ready
for
the
lady
and
children
i
am
sorry
to
rattle
you
about
thus
madame
but
war
has
no
courtesies
and
march
i
and
so
the
french
went
out
of
spalding
town
don
t
be
in
a
hurry
to
thank
your
saints
shouted
ivo
to
his
victims
i
shall
be
back
this
day
three
months
and
then
you
shall
see
a
row
of
gibbets
all
the
way
from
here
to
deeping
and
an
englishman
hanging
on
every
chapter
xxii
how
hereward
sailed
foe
england
once
and
for
all
so
hereward
fought
the
viscount
of
pinkney
who
had
the
usual
luck
which
befell
those
who
crossed
swords
with
him
and
plotted
meanwhile
with
gyda
and
the
countess
judith
abbot
egelsin
sent
them
news
from
king
sweyn
in
denmark
soon
judith
and
tosti
s
two
sons
went
themselves
to
sweyn
and
helped
the
plot
and
the
fitting
out
of
the
armament
news
they
had
from
england
in
plenty
by
messengers
from
queen
matilda
to
the
sister
who
was
intriguing
to
dethrone
her
husband
and
by
private
messengers
from
durham
and
from
york
baldwin
the
marquis
had
not
lived
to
see
this
fruit
of
his
long
efforts
to
please
everybody
he
had
gone
to
his
rest
the
year
before
and
now
there
ruled
in
bruges
his
son
baldwin
the
good
count
palatine
as
he
styled
himself
and
his
wife
richilda
the
lady
of
hainault
they
probably
cared
as
little
for
the
success
of
their
sister
matilda
as
they
did
for
that
of
their
sister
judith
and
followed
out
baldwin
at
least
the
great
marquis
s
plan
of
making
flanders
a
retreat
for
the
fugitives
of
all
the
countries
round
at
least
if
as
seems
sweyn
s
fleet
made
the
coast
of
flanders
its
rendezvous
and
base
of
operations
against
king
william
baldwin
offered
no
resistance
so
the
messengers
came
and
the
plots
went
on
great
was
the
delight
of
hereward
and
the
ladies
when
they
heard
of
the
taking
of
durham
and
york
but
bitter
their
surprise
and
rage
when
they
heard
that
gospatrick
and
the
confederates
had
proclaimed
edgar
atheling
king
fools
they
will
ruin
all
cried
gyda
do
they
expect
swend
ulfsson
who
never
moved
a
finger
yet
unless
he
saw
that
it
would
pay
him
within
the
hour
to
spend
blood
and
treasure
in
putting
that
puppet
boy
upon
the
throne
instead
of
himself
calm
yourself
great
countess
said
hereward
with
a
smile
the
man
who
puts
him
on
the
throne
will
find
it
very
easy
to
take
him
off
again
when
he
pish
said
gyda
he
must
put
him
on
the
throne
first
and
how
will
he
do
that
will
the
men
of
the
danelagh
much
less
the
northumbrians
ever
rally
round
an
atheling
of
cerdic
s
house
they
are
raising
a
wessex
army
in
northumbria
a
southern
army
in
the
north
there
is
no
real
loyalty
there
toward
the
atheling
not
even
the
tie
of
kin
as
there
would
be
to
swend
the
boy
is
a
mere
behind
which
each
of
these
greedy
chiefs
expects
to
get
back
his
own
lands
and
if
they
can
get
them
back
by
any
other
means
well
and
good
mark
my
words
sir
hereward
that
cunning
frenchman
will
treat
with
them
one
by
one
and
betray
them
one
by
one
till
there
is
none
how
far
gyda
was
right
will
be
seen
hereafter
but
a
less
practised
diplomat
than
the
great
countess
might
have
speculated
reasonably
on
such
an
event
at
least
let
this
be
said
that
when
historians
have
complained
of
the
treachery
of
king
swend
ulfsson
and
his
danes
they
have
forgotten
certain
broad
and
simple
facts
swend
sailed
for
england
to
take
a
kingdom
which
he
believed
to
be
his
by
right
which
he
had
formerly
demanded
of
william
when
he
arrived
there
he
found
himself
a
mere
cat
for
recovering
that
kingdom
for
an
incapable
boy
whom
he
believed
to
have
no
right
to
the
throne
at
all
then
came
darker
news
as
ivo
had
foreseen
and
as
ivo
had
done
his
best
to
bring
about
william
dashed
on
york
and
drove
out
the
confederates
with
terrible
slaughter
profaned
the
churches
plundered
the
town
gospatrick
and
the
earls
retreated
to
durham
the
atheling
more
cautious
to
scotland
then
came
a
strange
story
worthy
of
the
grown
children
who
in
those
old
times
bore
the
hearts
of
boys
with
the
ferocity
and
intellect
of
men
a
great
fog
fell
on
the
frenchmen
as
they
struggled
over
the
durham
moors
the
doomed
city
was
close
beneath
them
they
heard
wear
roaring
in
his
wooded
gorge
but
a
darkness
as
of
egypt
lay
upon
them
neither
rose
any
from
his
then
the
frenchmen
cried
this
darkness
is
from
cuthbert
himself
we
have
invaded
his
holy
soil
who
has
not
heard
how
none
who
offend
cuthbert
ever
went
unpunished
how
palsy
blindness
madness
fall
on
those
who
dare
to
violate
his
sanctuary
and
the
french
turned
and
fled
from
before
the
face
of
cuthbert
and
william
went
down
to
winchester
angry
and
sad
and
then
went
off
to
gloucestershire
and
hunted
for
whatever
befell
he
still
would
hunt
in
the
forest
of
dean
and
still
swend
and
his
danes
had
not
sailed
and
hereward
walked
to
and
fro
in
his
house
impatiently
and
bided
his
time
in
july
baldwin
died
arnoul
the
boy
was
count
of
flanders
and
richilda
his
ruled
the
land
in
his
name
she
began
to
oppress
the
flemings
not
those
of
french
flanders
round
omer
but
those
of
flemish
flanders
toward
the
north
they
threatened
to
send
for
robert
the
frison
to
right
them
hereward
was
perplexed
he
was
robert
the
frison
s
friend
and
old
soldier
richilda
was
torfrida
s
friend
so
was
still
more
the
boy
arnoul
which
party
should
he
take
neither
if
he
could
help
it
and
he
longed
to
be
safe
out
of
the
land
and
at
last
his
time
came
martin
lightfoot
ran
in
breathless
to
tell
how
the
sails
of
a
mighty
fleet
were
visible
from
the
dunes
here
cried
hereward
what
are
the
fools
doing
down
here
wandering
into
the
very
jaws
of
the
wolf
how
will
they
land
here
they
were
to
have
gone
straight
to
the
lincolnshire
coast
god
grant
this
mistake
be
not
the
first
of
dozens
hereward
went
into
torfrida
s
bower
this
is
an
evil
business
the
danes
are
here
where
they
have
no
business
instead
of
being
off
scheldtmouth
as
i
entreated
them
but
go
we
must
or
be
forever
shamed
now
true
wife
are
you
ready
dare
you
leave
home
and
kin
and
friends
once
and
for
all
to
go
you
know
not
whither
with
one
who
may
be
a
gory
corpse
by
this
day
week
i
dare
said
she
so
they
went
down
to
calais
by
night
with
torfrida
s
mother
and
all
their
jewels
and
all
they
had
in
the
world
and
their
housecarles
went
with
them
forty
men
tried
and
trained
who
had
vowed
to
follow
hereward
round
the
world
and
there
were
two
long
ships
ready
and
twenty
good
mariners
in
each
so
when
the
danes
made
the
south
foreland
the
next
morning
they
were
aware
of
two
gallant
ships
bearing
down
on
them
with
a
great
white
bear
embroidered
on
their
sails
a
proud
man
was
hereward
that
day
as
he
sailed
into
the
midst
of
the
danish
fleet
and
up
to
the
royal
ships
and
shouted
i
am
hereward
the
berserker
and
i
come
to
take
service
under
my
rightful
lord
sweyn
king
of
come
on
board
then
we
know
you
well
and
right
glad
we
are
to
have
hereward
with
and
hereward
laid
his
ship
s
bow
upon
the
quarter
of
the
royal
ship
to
lay
alongside
was
impossible
for
fear
of
breaking
oars
and
came
on
board
and
thou
art
hereward
asked
a
tall
and
noble
warrior
i
am
and
thou
art
swend
ulfsson
the
king
i
am
earl
osbiorn
his
then
where
is
the
king
he
is
in
denmark
and
i
command
his
fleet
and
with
me
are
canute
and
harold
sweyn
s
sons
and
earls
and
bishops
enough
for
all
this
was
spoken
in
a
somewhat
haughty
tone
in
answer
to
the
look
of
surprise
and
disappointment
which
hereward
had
unawares
allowed
to
pass
over
his
face
thou
art
better
than
none
said
hereward
now
hearken
osbiorn
the
earl
had
swend
been
here
i
would
have
put
my
hand
between
his
and
said
in
my
own
name
and
that
of
all
the
men
in
kesteven
and
the
fens
swend
s
men
we
are
to
live
and
die
but
now
as
it
is
i
say
for
me
and
them
thy
men
we
are
to
live
and
die
as
long
as
thou
art
true
to
true
to
you
i
will
be
said
osbiorn
be
it
so
said
hereward
true
we
shall
be
whatever
betide
now
whither
goes
earl
osbiorn
and
all
his
great
meinie
we
purpose
to
try
you
will
not
take
it
the
frenchman
has
strengthened
it
with
one
of
his
accursed
keeps
and
without
you
may
sit
before
it
a
what
if
i
asked
you
to
go
in
thither
yourself
and
try
the
mettle
and
the
luck
which
they
say
never
failed
hereward
yet
i
should
say
that
it
was
a
child
s
trick
to
throw
away
against
a
paltry
stone
wall
the
life
of
a
man
who
was
ready
to
raise
for
you
in
lincolnshire
and
cambridgeshire
five
times
as
many
men
as
you
will
lose
in
taking
hereward
is
right
said
more
than
one
earl
we
shall
need
him
in
his
own
if
you
are
wise
to
that
country
you
yourselves
will
go
it
is
ready
to
receive
you
this
is
ready
to
oppose
you
you
are
attacking
the
frenchman
at
his
strongest
point
instead
of
his
weakest
did
i
not
send
again
and
again
entreating
you
to
cross
from
scheldtmouth
to
the
wash
and
send
me
word
that
i
might
come
and
raise
the
for
you
and
then
we
would
all
go
north
together
i
have
heard
ere
now
said
earl
osbiorn
haughtily
that
hereward
though
he
be
a
valiant
viking
is
more
fond
of
giving
advice
than
of
taking
hereward
was
about
to
answer
very
fiercely
if
he
had
no
one
would
have
thought
any
harm
in
those
times
but
he
was
wise
and
restrained
himself
remembering
that
torfrida
was
there
all
but
alone
in
the
midst
of
a
fleet
of
savage
men
and
that
beside
he
had
a
great
deed
to
do
and
must
do
it
as
he
could
so
he
answered
osbiorn
the
earl
has
not
it
seems
heard
this
of
hereward
that
because
he
is
accustomed
to
command
he
is
also
accustomed
to
obey
what
thou
wilt
do
do
and
bid
me
do
he
that
quarrels
with
his
captain
cuts
his
own
throat
and
his
fellows
wisely
spoken
said
the
earls
and
hereward
went
back
to
his
ship
torfrida
said
he
bitterly
the
game
is
lost
before
it
is
god
forbid
my
beloved
what
words
are
these
swend
fool
that
he
is
with
his
always
the
same
has
let
the
prize
slip
from
between
his
fingers
he
has
sent
osbiorn
instead
of
but
why
is
that
so
terrible
a
mistake
we
do
not
want
a
fleet
of
vikings
in
england
to
plunder
the
french
and
english
alike
we
want
a
king
a
king
a
king
and
hereward
stamped
with
rage
and
instead
of
a
king
we
have
this
osbiorn
all
men
know
him
greedy
and
false
and
here
he
is
going
to
be
beaten
off
at
dover
and
then
i
suppose
at
the
next
port
and
so
forth
till
the
whole
season
is
wasted
and
the
ships
and
men
lost
by
driblets
pray
for
us
to
god
and
his
saints
torfrida
you
who
are
nearer
to
heaven
than
i
for
we
never
needed
it
and
osbiorn
went
in
tried
to
take
dover
and
was
beaten
off
with
heavy
loss
then
the
earls
bade
him
take
hereward
s
advice
but
he
would
not
so
he
went
round
the
foreland
and
tried
sandwich
as
if
landing
there
he
would
have
been
safe
in
marching
on
london
in
the
teeth
of
the
of
normandy
but
he
was
beaten
off
there
with
more
loss
then
too
late
he
took
hereward
s
advice
or
rather
half
of
it
and
sailed
north
but
only
to
commit
more
follies
he
dared
not
enter
the
thames
he
would
not
go
on
to
the
wash
but
he
went
into
the
orwell
and
attacked
ipswich
plundering
right
and
left
instead
of
proclaiming
king
sweyn
and
calling
the
danish
folk
around
him
the
danish
folk
of
suffolk
rose
and
like
valiant
men
beat
him
off
while
hereward
lay
outside
the
river
mouth
his
soul
within
him
black
with
disappointment
rage
and
shame
he
would
not
go
in
he
would
not
fight
against
his
own
countrymen
he
would
not
help
to
turn
the
whole
plan
into
a
marauding
raid
and
he
told
earl
osbiorn
so
so
fiercely
that
his
life
would
have
been
in
danger
had
not
the
force
of
his
arm
been
as
much
feared
as
the
force
of
his
name
was
needed
at
last
they
came
to
yarmouth
osbiorn
would
needs
land
there
and
try
norwich
hereward
was
nigh
desperate
but
he
hit
upon
a
plan
let
osbiorn
do
so
if
he
would
he
himself
would
sail
round
to
the
wash
raise
the
and
march
eastward
at
their
head
through
norfolk
to
meet
him
osbiorn
himself
could
not
refuse
so
rational
a
proposal
all
the
earls
and
bishops
approved
loudly
and
away
hereward
went
to
the
wash
his
heart
broken
foreseeing
nothing
but
evil
chapter
xxiii
how
hereward
gathered
an
army
the
voyage
round
the
norfolk
coast
was
rough
and
wild
torfrida
was
ill
the
little
girl
was
ill
the
poor
old
mother
was
so
ill
that
she
could
not
even
say
her
prayers
packed
uncomfortably
under
the
awning
on
the
poop
torfrida
looked
on
from
beneath
it
upon
the
rolling
with
a
heart
full
of
gloomy
forebodings
and
a
brain
whirling
with
wild
fancies
the
wreaths
of
cloud
were
gray
witches
hurrying
on
with
the
ship
to
work
her
woe
the
low
red
was
streaked
with
blood
the
water
which
gurgled
all
night
under
the
lee
was
alive
with
hoarse
voices
and
again
and
again
she
started
from
fitful
slumber
to
clasp
the
child
closer
to
her
or
look
up
for
comfort
to
the
sturdy
figure
of
her
husband
as
he
stood
like
a
tower
of
strength
steering
and
commanding
the
long
night
through
yes
on
him
she
could
depend
on
his
courage
on
his
skill
and
as
for
his
love
had
she
not
that
utterly
and
what
more
did
woman
need
but
she
was
going
she
scarce
knew
whither
and
she
scarce
knew
for
what
at
least
on
a
fearful
adventure
which
might
have
a
fearful
end
she
looked
at
the
fair
child
and
reproached
herself
for
a
moment
at
the
poor
old
mother
whining
and
mumbling
her
soft
southern
heart
quite
broken
by
the
wild
chill
northern
and
reproached
herself
still
more
but
was
it
not
her
duty
him
she
loved
and
his
she
was
and
him
she
must
follow
over
sea
and
land
till
death
and
if
possible
beyond
death
again
forever
for
his
sake
she
would
slave
for
his
sake
she
would
be
strong
if
ever
there
rose
in
her
a
homesickness
a
regret
for
leaving
flanders
and
much
more
for
that
sunnier
south
where
she
was
born
he
at
least
should
never
be
saddened
or
weakened
by
one
hint
of
her
sadness
and
weakness
and
so
it
befell
that
by
the
time
they
made
the
coast
she
had
as
the
old
chronicler
says
altogether
conquered
all
womanly
and
yet
she
shuddered
at
the
dreary
into
which
they
ran
their
ships
at
the
dreary
flats
on
which
they
landed
shivering
swept
over
by
the
keen
northeast
wind
a
lonely
land
and
within
she
knew
not
what
of
danger
it
might
be
of
hideous
death
but
she
would
be
strong
and
when
they
were
all
landed
men
arms
baggage
and
had
pitched
the
tents
which
the
wise
hereward
had
brought
with
them
she
rose
up
like
a
queen
and
took
her
little
one
by
the
hand
and
went
among
the
men
and
spoke
housecarles
and
mariners
you
are
following
a
great
captain
upon
a
great
adventure
how
great
he
is
you
know
as
well
as
i
have
given
him
myself
my
wealth
and
all
i
have
and
have
followed
him
i
know
not
whither
because
i
trust
him
utterly
men
trust
him
as
i
trust
him
and
follow
him
to
the
that
will
we
and
men
i
am
here
among
you
a
weak
woman
trying
to
be
brave
for
his
sake
and
for
yours
be
true
to
me
too
as
i
have
been
true
to
you
for
your
sake
have
i
worked
hard
day
and
night
for
many
a
year
for
you
i
have
baked
and
brewed
and
cooked
like
any
poor
churl
s
wife
is
there
a
garment
on
your
backs
which
my
hands
have
not
mended
is
there
a
wound
on
your
limbs
which
my
hands
have
not
salved
o
if
torfrida
has
been
true
to
you
promise
me
this
day
that
you
will
be
true
men
to
her
and
hers
that
if
which
heaven
forbid
aught
should
befall
him
and
me
you
will
protect
this
my
poor
old
mother
and
this
my
child
who
has
grown
up
among
you
all
a
lamb
brought
up
within
the
lions
den
look
at
her
men
and
promise
me
on
the
faith
of
valiant
soldiers
that
you
will
be
lions
on
her
behalf
if
she
shall
ever
need
you
promise
me
that
if
you
have
but
one
more
stroke
left
to
strike
on
earth
you
will
strike
it
to
defend
the
daughter
of
hereward
and
torfrida
from
cruelty
and
shame
the
men
answered
by
a
shout
which
rolled
along
the
fen
and
startled
the
up
from
pools
they
crowded
round
their
lady
they
kissed
her
hands
they
bent
down
and
kissed
their
little
playmate
and
swore
one
by
god
and
his
apostles
and
the
next
by
odin
and
thor
that
she
should
be
a
daughter
to
each
and
every
one
of
them
as
long
as
they
could
grip
steel
in
hand
then
says
the
chronicler
hereward
sent
on
spies
to
see
whether
the
frenchmen
were
in
the
land
and
how
folks
fared
at
holbeach
spalding
and
bourne
the
two
young
siwards
as
knowing
the
country
and
the
folk
pushed
forward
and
with
them
martin
lightfoot
to
bring
back
news
martin
ran
back
all
the
way
from
holbeach
the
very
first
day
with
right
good
news
there
was
not
a
frenchman
in
the
town
neither
was
there
they
said
in
spalding
ivo
taillebois
was
still
away
at
the
wars
and
long
might
he
stay
so
forward
they
marched
and
everywhere
the
landsfolk
were
tilling
the
ground
in
peace
and
when
they
saw
that
stout
array
they
hurried
out
to
meet
the
troops
and
burdened
them
with
food
and
ale
and
all
they
needed
and
at
holbeach
and
at
spalding
hereward
split
up
the
and
sent
it
through
kesteven
and
south
into
the
cambridge
fens
calling
on
all
men
to
arm
and
come
to
him
at
bourne
in
the
name
of
waltheof
and
morcar
the
earls
and
at
every
farm
and
town
he
blew
the
and
summoned
every
man
who
could
bear
arms
to
be
ready
against
the
coming
of
the
danish
host
from
norwich
and
so
through
all
the
fens
came
true
what
the
said
upon
the
meres
that
hereward
was
come
again
and
when
he
came
to
bourne
all
men
were
tilling
in
peace
the
terror
of
hereward
had
fallen
on
the
frenchmen
and
no
man
had
dared
to
enter
on
his
inheritance
or
to
set
a
french
foot
over
the
threshold
of
that
ghastly
hall
over
the
gable
whereof
still
grinned
the
fourteen
heads
on
the
floor
whereof
still
spread
the
dark
stains
of
blood
only
geri
dwelt
in
a
corner
of
the
house
and
with
him
leofric
the
unlucky
once
a
roistering
housecarle
of
hereward
s
youth
now
a
monk
of
crowland
and
a
deacon
whom
lady
godiva
had
sent
thither
that
he
might
take
care
of
her
poor
and
there
geri
and
leofric
had
kept
house
and
told
sagas
to
each
other
over
the
fire
night
after
night
for
all
leofric
s
study
was
says
the
chronicler
to
gather
together
for
the
edification
of
his
hearers
all
the
acts
of
giants
and
warriors
out
of
the
fables
of
the
ancients
or
from
faithful
report
and
commit
them
to
writing
that
he
might
keep
england
in
mind
which
leofric
was
afterwards
ordained
priest
probably
in
ely
by
bishop
egelwin
of
durham
and
was
hereward
s
chaplain
for
many
a
year
then
hereward
as
he
had
promised
set
fire
to
the
three
farms
close
to
the
bruneswold
and
all
his
outlawed
friends
lurking
in
the
forest
knew
by
that
signal
that
hereward
was
come
again
so
they
cleansed
out
the
old
house
though
they
did
not
take
down
the
heads
from
off
the
gable
and
torfrida
went
about
it
and
about
it
and
confessed
that
england
was
after
all
a
pleasant
place
enough
and
they
were
as
happy
it
may
be
for
a
week
or
two
as
ever
they
had
been
in
their
lives
and
now
said
torfrida
while
you
see
to
your
army
i
must
be
doing
for
i
am
a
lady
now
and
mistress
of
great
estates
so
i
must
be
seeing
to
the
but
you
can
not
speak
their
can
i
not
do
you
think
that
in
the
face
of
coming
to
england
and
fighting
here
and
plotting
here
and
being
may
be
an
earl
s
countess
i
have
not
made
martin
lightfoot
teach
me
your
english
tongue
till
i
can
speak
it
as
well
as
you
i
kept
that
hidden
as
a
surprise
for
you
that
you
might
find
out
when
you
most
needed
how
torfrida
loved
as
if
i
had
not
found
out
already
o
woman
woman
i
verily
believe
that
god
made
you
alone
and
left
the
devil
to
make
us
butchers
of
meanwhile
went
round
through
all
the
fens
and
north
into
the
bruneswold
and
away
again
to
lincoln
and
merry
sherwood
that
hereward
was
come
again
and
gilbert
of
ghent
keeping
lincoln
castle
for
the
conqueror
was
perplexed
in
mind
and
looked
well
to
gates
and
bars
and
sentinels
for
hereward
sent
him
at
once
a
message
that
forasmuch
as
he
had
forgotten
his
warning
in
bruges
street
and
put
a
rascal
cook
into
his
mother
s
manors
he
should
ride
odin
s
horse
on
the
highest
ash
in
the
bruneswold
on
which
gilbert
of
ghent
inquiring
what
odin
s
horse
might
be
and
finding
it
to
signify
the
whereon
as
sacred
to
odin
thieves
were
hanged
by
danes
and
norse
made
answer
that
he
gilbert
had
not
put
his
cook
into
bourne
nor
otherwise
harmed
hereward
or
his
that
bourne
had
been
seized
by
the
king
himself
together
with
earl
morcar
s
lands
in
those
parts
as
all
men
knew
that
the
said
cook
so
pleased
the
king
with
a
dish
of
stewed
which
he
served
up
to
him
at
cambridge
and
which
the
king
had
never
eaten
before
that
the
king
begged
the
said
cook
of
him
gilbert
and
took
him
away
and
that
after
so
he
heard
the
said
cook
had
begged
the
said
manors
of
bourne
of
the
king
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
him
gilbert
that
he
therefore
knew
naught
of
the
matter
that
if
hereward
meant
to
keep
the
king
s
peace
he
might
live
in
bourne
till
doomsday
for
aught
he
gilbert
cared
but
that
if
he
and
his
men
meant
to
break
the
king
s
peace
and
attack
lincoln
city
he
gilbert
would
nail
their
skins
to
the
door
of
lincoln
cathedral
as
they
used
to
do
by
the
heathen
danes
in
old
time
and
that
therefore
they
now
understood
each
other
at
which
hereward
laughed
and
said
that
they
had
done
that
for
many
a
year
and
now
poured
into
bourne
from
every
side
brave
men
and
true
some
great
holders
dispossessed
of
their
land
some
the
sons
of
holders
who
were
not
yet

set

he
slew

honor

of

english
race
these
valiant

the

more

fewer
they
would

constituted
a
formidable
force
as
after
years
proved
well

having
got
his
men
hereward
s
first
care
was
doubtless
to
teach
them
that
art
of
war
of
which
they
like
true
englishmen
knew
nothing
the
art
of
war
has
changed
little
if
at
all
by
the
introduction
of
gunpowder
the
campaigns
of
hannibal
and
caesar
succeeded
by
the
same
tactics
as
those
of
frederic
or
wellington
and
so
as
far
as
we
can
judge
did
those
of
the
of
his
age
william
of
normandy
but
of
those
tactics
the
english
knew
nothing
their
armies
were
little
more
than
tumultuous
levies
in
which
men
marched
and
fought
under
local
leaders
often
divided
by
local
jealousies
the
commissariats
of
the
armies
seem
to
have
been
so
worthless
that
they
had
to
plunder
friends
as
well
as
foes
as
they
went
along
and
with
plunder
came
every
sort
of
excess
as
when
the
northern
men
marching
down
to
meet
harold
godwinsson
and
demand
young
edwin
as
their
earl
laid
waste
seemingly
out
of
mere
brute
wantonness
the
country
round
northampton
which
must
have
been
in
edwin
s
earldom
or
at
least
in
that
of
his
brother
morcar
and
even
the
local
leaders
were
not
obeyed
the
reckless
spirit
of
personal
independence
especially
among
the
prevented
anything
like
discipline
or
organized
movement
of
masses
and
made
every
battle
degenerate
into
a
confusion
of
single
combats
but
hereward
had
learned
that
art
of
war
which
enabled
the
norman
to
crush
piecemeal
with
inferior
numbers
the
vast
but
straggling
levies
of
the
english
his
men
mostly
outlaws
and
homeless
kept
together
by
the
pressure
from
without
and
free
from
local
jealousies
resembled
rather
an
army
of
professional
soldiers
than
a
country
and
to
the
discipline
which
he
instilled
into
them
to
his
ability
in
marching
and
manoeuvring
troops
to
his
care
for
their
food
and
for
their
transport
possibly
also
to
his
training
them
in
that
art
of
fighting
on
horseback
in
which
the
men
of
wessex
if
not
the
of
the
east
are
said
to
have
been
quite
unskilled
in
short
to
all
that
he
had
learned
as
a
mercenary
under
robert
the
frison
and
among
the
highly
civilized
warriors
of
flanders
and
normandy
must
be
attributed
the
fact
that
he
and
his
little
army
defied
for
years
the
utmost
efforts
of
the
normans
appearing
and
disappearing
with
such
strange
swiftness
and
conquering
against
such
strange
odds
as
enshrouded
the
guerilla
captain
in
an
atmosphere
of
myth
and
wonder
only
to
be
accounted
for
in
the
mind
of
normans
as
well
as
english
by
the
supernatural
counsels
of
his
sorceress
wife
but
hereward
grew
anxious
and
more
anxious
as
days
and
weeks
went
on
and
yet
there
was
no
news
of
osbiorn
and
his
danes
at
norwich
time
was
precious
he
had
to
march
his
little
army
to
the
wash
and
then
transport
it
by
boats
no
easy
matter
to
lynn
in
norfolk
as
his
nearest
point
of
attack
and
as
the
time
went
on
earl
warren
and
ralph
de
guader
would
have
gathered
their
forces
between
him
and
the
danes
and
a
landing
at
lynn
might
become
impossible
meanwhile
there
were
bruits
of
great
doings
in
the
north
of
lincolnshire
young
earl
waltheof
was
said
to
be
there
and
edgar
the
atheling
with
him
but
what
it
portended
no
man
knew
morcar
was
said
to
have
raised
the
centre
of
mercia
and
to
be
near
stafford
edwin
to
have
raised
the
welsh
and
to
be
at
chester
with
alfgiva
his
sister
harold
godwinsson
s
widow
and
hereward
sent
spies
along
the
roman
watling
street
the
only
road
then
toward
the
northwest
of
england
and
spies
northward
along
the
roman
road
to
lincoln
but
the
former
met
the
french
in
force
near
stafford
and
came
back
much
faster
than
they
went
and
the
latter
stumbled
on
gilbert
of
ghent
riding
out
of
lincoln
to
sleaford
and
had
to
flee
into
the
fens
and
came
back
much
slower
than
they
went
at
last
news
came
for
into
bourne
stalked
wulfric
the
heron
with
axe
and
bow
and
on
shoulder
and
an
evil
tale
he
brought
the
danes
had
been
beaten
utterly
at
norwich
ralph
de
guader
and
his
frenchmen
had
fought
like
lions
they
had
killed
many
danes
in
the
assault
on
the
castle
they
had
sallied
out
on
them
as
they
recoiled
and
driven
them
into
the
river
drowning
many
more
the
danes
had
gone
down
the
yare
again
and
out
to
sea
northward
no
man
knew
whither
he
the
heron
prowling
about
the
fenlands
of
norfolk
to
pick
off
straggling
frenchmen
and
looking
out
for
the
danes
had
heard
all
the
news
from
the
landsfolk
he
had
watched
the
danish
fleet
along
the
shore
as
far
as
blakeney
but
when
they
came
to
the
isle
they
stood
out
to
sea
right
northwest
he
the
heron
believed
that
they
were
gone
for
humber
mouth
after
a
while
he
had
heard
how
hereward
was
come
again
and
sent
round
the
and
thought
that
a
landless
man
could
be
in
no
better
company
wherefore
he
had
taken
boat
and
come
across
the
deep
fen
and
there
he
was
if
they
had
need
of
him
need
of
you
said
hereward
who
had
heard
of
the
deed
at
wrokesham
bridge
need
of
a
hundred
like
you
but
this
is
bitter
and
he
went
in
to
ask
counsel
of
torfrida
ready
to
weep
with
rage
he
had
disappointed
deceived
his
men
he
had
drawn
them
into
a
snare
he
had
promised
that
the
danes
should
come
how
should
he
look
them
in
the
face
look
them
in
the
face
do
that
at
once
now
without
losing
a
moment
call
them
together
and
tell
them
all
if
their
hearts
are
staunch
you
may
do
great
things
without
the
traitor
earl
if
their
hearts
fail
them
you
would
have
done
nothing
with
them
worthy
of
yourself
had
you
had
norway
as
well
as
denmark
at
your
back
at
least
be
true
with
them
as
your
only
chance
of
keeping
them
true
to
wise
wise
wife
said
hereward
and
went
out
and
called
his
band
together
and
told
them
every
word
and
all
that
had
passed
since
he
left
calais
straits
and
now
i
have
deceived
you
and
entrapped
you
and
i
have
no
right
to
be
your
captain
more
he
that
will
depart
in
peace
let
him
depart
before
the
frenchmen
close
in
on
us
on
every
side
and
swallow
us
up
at
one
not
a
man
answered
i
say
it
again
he
that
will
depart
let
him
they
stood
thoughtful
ranald
the
monk
of
ramsey
drove
the
banner
firm
into
the
earth
tucked
up
his
monk
s
frock
and
threw
his
long
axe
over
his
shoulder
as
if
preparing
for
action
winter
spoke
at
last
if
all
go
there
are
two
men
here
who
stay
and
fight
by
hereward
s
side
as
long
as
there
is
a
frenchman
left
on
english
soil
for
they
have
sworn
an
oath
to
heaven
and
to
peter
and
that
oath
will
they
keep
what
say
you
gwenoch
knighted
with
us
at
peterborough
gwenoch
stepped
to
hereward
s
side
none
shall
go
shouted
a
dozen
voices
with
hereward
we
will
live
and
die
let
him
lead
us
to
lincoln
to
stafford
where
he
will
we
can
save
england
for
ourselves
without
the
help
of
it
is
well
for
one
at
least
of
you
gentlemen
that
you
are
in
this
pleasant
mind
quoth
ranald
the
monk
well
for
all
of
us
thou
valiant
purveyor
of
beef
and
well
for
one
for
the
first
man
that
had
turned
to
go
i
would
have
brained
him
with
this
and
now
gallant
gentlemen
said
hereward
we
must
take
new
counsel
as
our
old
has
failed
whither
shall
we
go
for
stay
here
eating
up
the
country
we
must
not
they
say
that
waltheof
is
in
lindsay
raising
the
landsfolk
let
us
go
and
join
we
can
at
least
find
what
he
means
to
do
there
can
be
no
better
counsel
let
us
march
only
we
must
keep
clear
of
lincoln
as
yet
i
hear
that
gilbert
has
a
strong
garrison
there
and
we
are
not
strong
enough
yet
to
force
so
they
rode
north
and
up
the
roman
road
toward
lincoln
sending
out
spies
as
they
went
and
soon
they
had
news
of
waltheof
news
too
that
he
was
between
them
and
lincoln
then
the
sooner
we
are
with
him
the
better
for
he
will
find
himself
in
trouble
ere
long
if
old
gilbert
gets
news
of
him
so
run
your
best
footmen
for
forward
we
must
and
as
they
came
up
the
roman
road
they
were
aware
of
a
great
press
of
men
in
front
of
them
and
hard
fighting
toward
some
of
the
english
would
have
spurred
forward
at
once
but
hereward
held
them
back
with
loud
reproaches
will
you
forget
all
i
have
told
you
in
the
first
skirmish
like
so
many
dogs
when
they
see
a
bull
keep
together
for
five
minutes
more
the
pot
will
not
be
cool
before
we
get
our
sup
of
it
i
verily
believe
that
it
is
waltheof
and
that
gilbert
has
caught
him
as
he
spoke
one
part
of
the
combatants
broke
up
and
fled
right
and
left
and
a
knight
in
full
armor
galloped
furiously
down
the
road
right
at
them
followed
by
two
or
three
more
here
comes
some
one
very
valiant
or
very
much
afeared
said
hereward
as
the
horseman
rode
right
upon
him
shouting
i
am
the
king
the
king
roared
hereward
and
dropping
his
lance
spurred
his
horse
forward
kicking
his
feet
clear
of
the
stirrups
he
caught
the
knight
round
the
neck
dragged
him
over
his
horse
s
tail
and
fell
with
him
to
the
ground
the
armor
clashed
the
sparks
flew
from
the
old
gray
roman
flints
and
hereward
rolling
over
once
rose
and
knelt
upon
his
prisoner
william
of
normandy
yield
or
die
the
knight
lay
still
and
stark
ride
on
roared
hereward
from
the
ground
ride
at
them
and
strike
hard
you
will
soon
find
out
which
is
which
this
booty
i
must
pick
for
myself
what
are
you
at
roared
he
after
his
knights
spread
off
the
road
and
keep
your
line
as
i
told
you
and
don
t
override
each
other
curse
the
fools
the
normans
will
scatter
them
like
sparrows
run
on
to
stop
the
french
if
we
are
broken
and
don
t
forget
guisnes
field
and
the
horses
legs
now
king
are
you
come
to
life
yet
you
have
killed
him
quoth
leofric
the
deacon
whom
hereward
had
beckoned
to
stop
with
him
i
hope
not
lend
me
a
knife
he
is
a
much
slighter
man
than
i
fancied
said
hereward
as
they
got
his
helmet
off
and
when
it
was
off
both
started
and
stared
for
they
had
uncovered
not
the
beetling
brow
roman
nose
and
firm
curved
lip
of
the
ulysses
of
the
middle
age
but
the
face
of
a
fair
lad
with
long
hair
and
soft
blue
eyes
staring
into
vacancy
who
are
you
shouted
hereward
saying
very
bad
words
who
come
here
aping
the
name
of
king
mother
christina
margaret
waltheof
earl
moaned
the
lad
raising
his
head
and
letting
it
fall
again
it
is
the
atheling
cried
leofric
hereward
rose
and
stood
over
the
boy
ah
what
was
i
doing
to
handle
him
so
tenderly
i
took
him
for
the
mamzer
and
thought
of
a
king
s
do
you
call
that
tenderly
you
have
nigh
pulled
the
boy
s
head
would
that
i
had
ah
went
on
hereward
apostrophizing
the
unconscious
atheling
ah
that
i
had
broken
that
white
neck
once
and
for
all
to
have
sent
thee
feet
foremost
to
winchester
to
lie
by
thy
grandfathers
and
and
then
to
tell
norman
william
that
he
must
fight
it
out
henceforth
not
with
a
straw
malkin
like
thee
which
the
very
crows
are
not
afraid
to
perch
on
but
with
a
cock
of
a
very
different
hackle
sweyn
ulfsson
king
of
and
hereward
drew
for
mercy
s
sake
you
will
not
harm
the
lad
if
i
were
a
wise
man
now
and
as
wise
men
should
be
i
should
i
should
and
he
played
the
point
of
the
sword
backwards
and
forwards
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
lad
s
throat
master
master
cried
leofric
clinging
to
his
knees
by
all
the
saints
what
would
the
blessed
virgin
say
to
such
a
deed
well
i
suppose
you
are
right
and
i
fear
what
my
lady
at
home
might
say
and
we
must
not
do
anything
to
vex
her
you
know
well
let
us
do
it
handsomely
if
we
must
do
it
get
water
somewhere
in
his
helmet
no
you
need
not
linger
i
will
not
cut
his
throat
before
you
come
leofric
went
off
in
search
of
water
and
hereward
knelt
with
the
atheling
s
head
on
his
knee
and
on
his
lip
a
sneer
at
all
things
in
heaven
and
earth
to
have
that
lad
stand
between
him
and
all
his
projects
and
to
be
forced
for
honor
s
sake
to
let
him
stand
but
soon
his
men
returned
seemingly
in
high
glee
and
other
knights
with
them
hey
lads
said
he
i
aimed
at
the
falcon
and
shot
the
goose
here
is
edgar
atheling
prisoner
shall
we
put
him
to
ransom
he
has
no
money
and
malcolm
of
scotland
is
much
too
wise
to
lend
him
any
said
some
one
and
some
more
rough
jokes
passed
do
you
know
sirs
that
he
who
lies
there
is
your
king
asked
a
very
tall
and
knight
that
do
we
not
said
hereward
sharply
there
is
no
king
in
england
this
day
as
far
as
i
know
and
there
will
be
none
north
of
the
watling
street
till
he
be
chosen
in
full
husting
and
anointed
at
york
as
well
as
winchester
or
london
we
have
had
one
king
made
for
us
in
the
last
forty
years
and
we
intend
to
make
the
next
and
who
art
thou
who
talkest
so
bold
of
and
who
art
thou
who
askest
so
bold
who
i
am
i
am
waltheof
siwardsson
the
earl
and
yon
is
my
army
behind
and
i
am
hereward
leofricsson
the
outlaw
and
yon
is
my
army
behind
if
the
two
champions
had
flown
at
each
other
s
throats
and
their
armies
had
followed
their
example
simply
as
dogs
fly
at
each
other
they
know
not
why
no
one
would
have
been
astonished
in
those
unhappy
times
but
it
fell
not
out
upon
that
wise
for
waltheof
leaping
from
his
horse
pulled
off
his
helmet
and
seizing
hereward
by
both
hands
cried
blessed
is
the
day
which
sees
again
in
england
hereward
who
has
upheld
throughout
all
lands
and
seas
the
honor
of
english
chivalry
and
blessed
is
the
day
in
which
hereward
meets
the
head
of
the
house
of
siward
where
he
should
be
at
the
head
of
his
own
men
in
his
own
earldom
when
i
saw
my
friend
thy
brother
osbiorn
brought
into
the
camp
at
dunsinane
with
all
his
wounds
in
front
i
wept
a
young
man
s
tears
and
said
there
ends
the
glory
of
the
s
house
but
this
day
i
say
the
s
blood
is
risen
from
the
grave
in
waltheof
siwardsson
who
with
his
single
axe
kept
the
gate
of
york
against
all
the
army
of
the
french
and
who
shall
keep
against
them
all
england
if
he
will
be
as
wise
as
he
is
was
hereward
honest
in
his
words
hardly
so
he
wished
to
be
honest
as
he
looked
upon
that
magnificent
young
man
he
hoped
and
trusted
that
his
words
were
true
but
he
gave
a
second
look
at
the
face
and
whispered
to
himself
weak
weak
he
will
be
led
by
priests
perhaps
by
william
himself
i
must
be
courteous
but
confide
i
must
the
men
stood
round
and
looked
with
admiration
on
the
two
most
splendid
englishmen
then
alive
hereward
had
taken
off
his
helmet
likewise
and
the
contrast
between
the
two
was
as
striking
as
the
completeness
of
each
of
them
in
his
own
style
of
beauty
it
was
the
contrast
between
the
and
the
each
alike
high
bred
but
the
former
short
sturdy
cheerful
and
sagacious
the
latter
tall
stately
melancholy
and
not
withal
waltheof
was
a
full
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
hereward
one
of
the
tallest
men
of
his
generation
and
of
a
strength
which
would
have
been
gigantic
but
for
the
too
great
length
of
neck
and
limb
which
made
him
loose
and
slow
in
body
as
he
was
somewhat
loose
and
slow
in
mind
an
old
man
s
child
although
that
old
man
was
as
one
of
the
old
giants
there
was
a
vein
of
weakness
in
him
which
showed
in
the
arched
eyebrow
the
sleepy
pale
blue
eye
the
small
soft
mouth
the
lazy
voice
the
narrow
and
lofty
brain
over
a
shallow
brow
his
face
was
not
that
of
a
warrior
but
of
a
saint
in
a
painted
window
and
to
his
own
place
he
went
and
became
a
saint
in
his
due
time
but
that
he
could
outgeneral
william
that
he
could
even
manage
gospatrick
and
his
intrigues
hereward
expected
as
little
as
that
his
own
nephews
edwin
and
morcar
could
do
it
i
have
to
thank
you
noble
sir
said
waltheof
languidly
for
sending
your
knights
to
our
rescue
when
we
were
really
hard
bested
i
fear
much
by
our
own
fault
had
they
told
me
whose
men
they
were
i
should
not
have
spoken
to
you
so
roughly
as
i
fear
i
there
is
no
offence
let
englishmen
speak
their
minds
as
long
as
english
land
is
above
sea
but
how
did
you
get
into
trouble
and
with
whom
waltheof
told
him
how
he
was
going
round
the
country
raising
forces
in
the
name
of
the
atheling
when
as
they
were
straggling
along
the
roman
road
gilbert
of
ghent
had
dashed
out
on
them
from
a
wood
cut
their
line
in
two
driven
waltheof
one
way
and
the
atheling
another
and
that
the
atheling
had
only
escaped
by
riding
as
they
saw
for
his
life
well
done
old
gilbert
laughed
hereward
you
must
beware
my
lord
earl
how
you
venture
within
reach
of
that
old
bear
s
paw
bear
by
the
by
sir
hereward
asked
waltheof
whose
thoughts
ran
loosely
right
and
left
why
is
it
that
you
carry
the
white
bear
on
your
banner
do
you
not
know
your
house
ought
to
have
a
against
me
i
slew
your
or
cousin
or
some
other
kinsman
at
gilbert
s
house
in
scotland
long
ago
and
since
then
i
sleep
on
his
skin
every
night
and
carry
his
picture
in
my
banner
all
are
solemn
things
said
waltheof
frowning
karl
killed
my
grandfather
aldred
at
the
battle
of
settrington
and
his
four
sons
are
with
the
army
at
york
now
for
the
love
of
all
saints
and
of
england
do
not
think
of
avenging
that
every
man
must
now
put
away
old
grudges
and
remember
that
he
has
but
one
foe
william
and
his
very
nobly
spoken
but
those
sons
of
karl
and
i
think
you
said
you
had
killed
a
kinsman
of
mine
it
was
a
bear
lord
earl
a
great
white
bear
can
not
you
understand
a
jest
or
are
you
going
to
take
up
the
quarrels
of
all
white
bears
that
are
slain
between
here
and
iceland
you
will
end
by
burning
crowland
minster
then
for
there
are
twelve
of
your
kinsmen
s
skins
there
which
canute
gave
forty
years
burn
crowland
minster
guthlac
and
all
saints
forbid
said
waltheof
crossing
himself
devoutly
are
you
a
into
the
bargain
as
well
as
a
dolt
a
bad
prospect
for
us
if
you
are
said
hereward
to
himself
ah
my
dear
lord
king
said
waltheof
and
you
are
recovering
somewhat
said
the
lad
sitting
up
under
the
care
of
this
kind
he
is
a
monk
sir
atheling
and
not
a
knight
said
hereward
our
fenmen
can
wear
a
as
easily
as
a
frock
and
handle
a
twybill
as
neatly
as
a
waltheof
shook
his
head
it
is
contrary
to
the
canons
of
holy
so
are
many
things
that
are
done
in
england
just
now
need
has
no
master
now
sir
earl
and
sir
atheling
what
are
you
going
to
do
neither
of
them
it
seemed
very
well
knew
they
would
go
to
york
if
they
could
get
there
and
join
gospatrick
and
marlesweyn
and
certainly
it
was
the
most
reasonable
thing
to
be
done
but
if
you
mean
to
get
to
york
you
must
march
after
another
fashion
than
this
said
hereward
see
sir
earl
why
you
were
broken
by
gilbert
and
why
you
will
be
broken
again
if
this
order
holds
if
you
march
your
men
along
one
of
these
old
roman
streets
by
mary
these
romans
had
more
wits
than
we
for
we
have
spoilt
the
roads
they
left
us
and
never
made
a
new
one
of
our
own
they
were
heathens
and
enchanters
and
waltheof
crossed
himself
and
conquered
the
world
well
if
you
march
along
one
of
these
streets
you
must
ride
as
i
rode
when
i
came
up
to
you
you
must
not
let
your
knights
go
first
and
your
straggle
after
in
a
tail
a
mile
long
like
a
scratch
pack
of
hounds
all
sizes
but
except
each
others
you
must
keep
your
footmen
on
the
high
street
and
make
your
knights
ride
in
two
bodies
right
and
left
upon
the
wold
to
protect
their
flanks
and
but
the
knights
won
t
as
gentlemen
they
have
a
right
to
the
best
then
they
may
go
to
whither
they
will
go
if
the
french
come
upon
them
if
they
are
on
the
flanks
and
you
are
attacked
then
they
can
charge
in
right
and
left
on
the
enemy
s
flank
while
the
footmen
make
a
stand
to
cover
the
yes
that
is
very
good
i
believe
that
is
your
french
fashion
it
is
the
fashion
of
like
all
things
which
but
you
see
the
knights
would
not
submit
to
ride
in
the
then
you
must
make
them
what
else
have
they
horses
for
while
honester
men
than
they
trudge
on
foot
make
them
said
waltheof
with
a
shrug
and
a
smile
they
are
all
free
gentlemen
like
and
like
ourselves
will
come
to
utter
ruin
because
every
one
of
them
must
needs
go
his
own
i
am
glad
said
waltheof
as
they
rode
along
that
you
called
this
my
earldom
i
hold
it
to
be
mine
of
course
in
right
of
my
father
but
the
landsfolks
you
know
gave
it
to
your
nephew
i
care
not
to
whom
it
is
given
i
care
for
the
man
who
is
on
it
to
raise
these
landsfolk
and
make
them
fight
you
are
here
therefore
you
are
yes
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
by
you
must
not
strain
that
text
too
far
lord
earl
for
the
only
power
that
is
whom
i
see
in
england
worse
luck
for
it
is
william
the
so
i
have
often
you
have
as
i
feared
to
himself
the
pike
will
have
you
next
gudgeon
he
has
with
him
the
holy
father
at
rome
and
therefore
the
blessed
apostle
peter
of
course
and
is
a
man
right
in
the
sight
of
heaven
who
resists
them
i
only
say
it
but
where
a
man
looks
to
the
salvation
of
his
own
soul
he
must
needs
think
thereof
seriously
at
o
are
you
at
that
thought
hereward
est
the
question
is
earl
said
he
aloud
simply
this
how
many
men
can
you
raise
off
this
shire
i
have
raised
not
so
many
as
i
could
wish
harold
and
edith
s
men
have
joined
me
fairly
well
but
your
nephew
morcar
s
i
can
command
them
i
have
half
of
them
here
then
then
we
may
raise
the
rest
that
depends
my
lord
earl
for
whom
we
fight
for
whom
i
do
not
whether
we
fight
for
that
lad
child
edgar
or
for
sweyn
of
denmark
the
rightful
king
of
sweyn
of
denmark
who
should
be
the
rightful
king
but
the
heir
of
the
blessed
edward
blessed
old
fool
he
has
done
harm
to
us
enough
on
earth
without
leaving
his
aunts
malkins
to
harm
us
after
he
is
in
sir
hereward
sir
hereward
i
fear
thou
art
not
as
good
a
christian
as
so
good
a
knight
should
christian
or
not
i
am
as
good
a
one
as
my
neighbors
i
am
leofric
s
son
leofric
put
harthacanute
on
the
throne
and
your
father
who
was
a
man
helped
him
you
know
what
has
befallen
england
since
we
danes
left
the
danish
stock
at
godwin
s
bidding
and
put
our
necks
under
the
yoke
of
wessex
monks
and
you
may
follow
your
father
s
track
or
not
as
you
like
i
shall
follow
my
father
s
and
fight
for
sweyn
ulfsson
and
no
man
and
i
said
waltheof
shall
follow
the
anointed
of
the
the
anointed
of
gospatrick
and
two
or
three
boys
said
hereward
knights
turn
your
horses
heads
right
about
face
all
we
are
going
back
to
the
bruneswold
to
live
and
die
free
and
to
waltheof
s
astonishment
who
had
never
before
seen
discipline
the
knights
wheeled
round
the
followed
them
and
waltheof
and
the
atheling
were
left
to
themselves
on
lincoln
heath
chapter
xxiv
how
archbishop
aldred
died
of
sorrow
in
the
tragedies
of
the
next
few
months
hereward
took
no
part
but
they
must
be
looked
at
near
in
order
to
understand
somewhat
of
the
men
who
were
afterwards
mixed
up
with
him
for
weal
or
woe
when
william
went
back
to
the
south
the
confederates
child
edgar
the
atheling
gospatrick
and
their
friends
had
come
south
again
from
durham
it
was
undignified
a
confession
of
weakness
if
a
norman
had
likened
them
to
mice
coming
out
when
the
cat
went
away
none
could
blame
him
but
so
they
did
and
osbiorn
and
his
danes
landing
in
were
met
says
the
chronicle
by
child
edgar
and
earl
waltheof
and
marlesweyn
and
earl
gospatrick
with
the
men
of
northumberland
riding
and
marching
joyfully
with
an
immense
army
not
having
the
spirit
of
prophecy
or
foreseeing
those
things
which
were
coming
on
the
earth
to
them
repaired
edwin
and
morcar
the
two
young
earls
arkill
and
karl
the
great
thanes
or
at
least
the
four
sons
of
karl
for
accounts
differ
and
what
few
else
of
the
northern
nobility
tosti
had
left
unmurdered
the
men
of
northumberland
received
the
danes
with
open
arms
they
would
besiege
york
they
would
storm
the
new
norman
keep
they
would
proclaim
edgar
king
at
york
in
that
keep
sat
two
men
one
of
whom
knew
his
own
mind
the
other
did
not
one
was
william
malet
knight
one
of
the
heroes
of
hastings
a
noble
norman
and
châtelain
of
york
castle
the
other
was
archbishop
aldred
aldred
seems
to
have
been
a
man
like
too
many
more
pious
and
virtuous
and
harmless
enough
and
not
without
worldly
prudence
but
his
prudence
was
of
that
sort
which
will
surely
swim
with
the
stream
and
honor
the
powers
that
be
if
they
be
but
prosperous
enough
for
after
all
if
success
be
not
god
it
is
like
enough
to
him
in
some
men
s
eyes
to
do
instead
so
archbishop
aldred
had
crowned
harold
godwinsson
when
harold
s
star
was
in
the
ascendant
and
who
but
archbishop
aldred
should
crown
william
when
his
star
had
cast
harold
s
down
from
heaven
he
would
have
crowned
satanas
himself
had
he
only
proved
himself
king
as
he
asserts
himself
to
be
of
this
wicked
world
so
aldred
who
had
not
only
crowned
william
but
supported
his
power
north
of
humber
by
all
means
lawful
sat
in
york
keep
and
looked
at
william
malet
wondering
what
he
would
do
malet
would
hold
it
to
the
last
as
for
the
new
keep
it
was
surely
impregnable
the
old
walls
the
roman
walls
on
which
had
floated
the
flag
of
constantine
the
great
were
surely
strong
enough
to
keep
out
men
without
balistas
or
artillery
of
any
kind
what
mattered
osbiorn
s
two
hundred
and
forty
ships
and
their
crews
of
some
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
men
what
mattered
the
tens
of
thousands
of
northern
men
with
gospatrick
at
their
head
let
them
rage
and
rob
round
the
walls
a
messenger
had
galloped
in
from
william
in
the
forest
of
dean
to
tell
malet
to
hold
out
to
the
last
he
had
galloped
out
again
bearing
for
answer
that
the
normans
could
hold
york
for
a
year
but
the
archbishop
s
heart
misgave
him
as
from
north
and
south
at
once
came
up
the
dark
masses
of
two
mighty
armies
broke
up
into
columns
and
surged
against
every
gate
of
the
city
at
the
same
time
they
had
no
to
breach
the
ancient
walls
but
they
had
and
none
knew
it
better
than
aldred
hundreds
of
friends
inside
who
would
throw
open
to
them
the
gates
one
gate
he
could
command
from
the
castle
tower
his
face
turned
pale
as
he
saw
a
mob
of
armed
townsmen
rushing
down
the
street
towards
it
a
furious
scuffle
with
the
french
guards
and
then
through
the
gateway
the
open
champaign
beyond
and
a
gleaming
wave
of
axes
helms
and
spears
pouring
in
and
up
the
street
the
traitors
he
almost
shrieked
as
he
turned
and
ran
down
the
ladder
to
tell
malet
below
malet
was
firm
but
pale
as
aldred
we
must
fight
to
the
last
said
he
as
he
hurried
down
commanding
his
men
to
sally
at
once
and
clear
the
city
the
mistake
was
fatal
the
french
were
entangled
in
the
narrow
streets
the
houses
shut
to
them
were
opened
to
the
english
and
danes
and
overwhelmed
from
above
as
well
as
in
front
the
greater
part
of
the
norman
garrison
perished
in
the
first
fight
the
remnant
were
shut
up
in
the
castle
the
danes
and
english
seized
the
houses
round
and
shot
from
the
windows
at
every
loophole
and
embrasure
where
a
norman
showed
himself
shoot
fire
upon
the
houses
said
malet
you
will
not
burn
york
o
god
is
it
come
to
this
and
why
not
york
town
or
york
minster
or
rome
itself
with
the
pope
inside
it
rather
than
yield
to
barbarians
archbishop
aldred
went
into
his
room
and
lay
down
on
his
bed
outside
was
the
roar
of
the
battle
and
soon
louder
and
louder
the
roar
of
flame
this
was
the
end
of
his
and
and
he
said
many
prayers
and
beat
his
breast
and
then
called
to
his
chaplain
for
blankets
for
he
was
very
cold
i
have
slain
my
own
sheep
he
moaned
slain
my
own
sheep
his
chaplain
hapt
him
up
in
bed
and
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
fight
there
was
no
lull
neither
was
there
any
great
advantage
on
either
side
only
from
the
southward
he
could
see
fresh
bodies
of
danes
coming
across
the
plain
the
carcass
is
here
and
the
eagles
are
gathered
together
fetch
me
the
holy
sacrament
chaplain
and
god
be
merciful
to
an
unfaithful
the
chaplain
went
i
have
slain
my
own
sheep
moaned
the
archbishop
i
have
given
them
up
to
the
wolves
given
my
own
minster
and
all
the
treasures
of
the
saints
and
and
i
am
very
when
the
chaplain
came
back
with
the
blessed
sacrament
archbishop
aldred
was
more
than
cold
for
he
was
already
dead
and
stiff
but
william
malet
would
not
yield
he
and
his
normans
fought
day
after
day
with
the
energy
of
despair
they
asked
leave
to
put
forth
the
body
of
the
archbishop
and
young
waltheof
who
was
a
pious
man
insisted
that
leave
should
be
given
so
the
archbishop
s
coffin
was
thrust
forth
of
the
and
the
monks
from
the
abbey
came
and
bore
it
away
and
buried
it
in
the
cathedral
church
and
then
the
fight
went
on
day
after
day
and
more
and
more
houses
burned
till
york
was
all
aflame
on
the
eighth
day
the
minster
was
in
a
light
low
over
archbishop
aldred
s
grave
all
was
burnt
minster
churches
old
roman
palaces
and
all
the
glories
of
constantine
the
great
and
the
mythic
past
the
besiegers
hewing
and
hammering
gate
after
gate
had
now
won
all
but
the
keep
itself
then
malet
s
heart
failed
him
a
wife
he
had
and
children
and
for
their
sake
he
turned
coward
and
fled
by
night
with
a
few
across
the
burning
ruins
then
into
what
once
was
york
the
confederate
earls
and
thanes
marched
in
triumph
and
proclaimed
edgar
king
a
king
of
dust
and
ashes
and
where
were
edwin
and
morcar
the
meanwhile
it
is
not
told
were
they
struggling
against
william
at
stafford
or
helping
edric
the
wild
and
his
welshmen
to
besiege
chester
probably
they
were
aiding
the
insurrection
if
not
at
these
two
points
still
at
some
other
of
their
great
earldoms
of
mercia
and
chester
they
seemed
to
triumph
for
a
while
during
the
autumn
of
the
greater
part
of
england
seemed
lost
to
william
many
normans
packed
up
their
plunder
and
went
back
to
france
and
those
whose
hearts
were
too
stout
to
return
showed
no
mercy
to
the
english
even
as
william
showed
none
to
crush
the
heart
of
the
people
by
massacres
and
mutilations
and
devastations
was
the
only
hope
of
the
invader
and
thoroughly
he
did
his
work
whenever
he
had
a
chance
chapter
xxv
how
hereward
found
a
wiser
man
in
england
than
himself
there
have
been
certain
men
so
great
that
he
who
describes
them
in
words
much
more
pretends
to
analyze
their
inmost
feelings
must
be
a
very
great
man
himself
or
incur
the
accusation
of
presumption
and
such
a
great
man
was
william
of
normandy
one
of
those
unfathomable
who
must
not
be
rashly
dragged
on
any
stage
the
genius
of
a
bulwer
in
attempting
to
draw
him
took
care
with
a
wise
modesty
not
to
draw
him
in
too
much
detail
to
confess
always
that
there
was
much
beneath
and
behind
in
william
s
character
which
none
even
of
his
contemporaries
could
guess
and
still
more
modest
than
bulwer
is
this
chronicler
bound
to
be
but
one
may
fancy
for
once
in
a
way
what
william
s
thoughts
were
when
they
brought
him
the
evil
news
of
york
for
we
know
what
his
acts
were
and
he
acted
up
to
his
thoughts
hunting
he
was
they
say
in
the
forest
of
dean
when
first
he
heard
that
all
england
north
of
the
watling
street
had
broken
loose
and
that
he
was
king
of
only
half
the
isle
did
he
as
when
hunting
in
the
forest
of
rouen
he
got
the
news
of
harold
s
coronation
play
with
his
bow
stringing
and
unstringing
it
nervously
till
he
had
made
up
his
mighty
mind
then
did
he
go
home
to
his
lodge
and
there
spread
on
the
rough
oak
board
a
parchment
map
of
england
which
no
child
would
deign
to
learn
from
now
but
was
then
good
enough
to
guide
armies
to
victory
because
the
eyes
of
a
great
general
looked
upon
it
as
he
pored
over
the
map
by
the
light
of
torch
or
rush
candle
what
would
he
see
upon
it
three
separate
blazes
of
insurrection
from
northwest
to
east
along
the
watling
street
at
chester
edric
the
wild
thane
who
according
to
had
lost
vast
lands
in
shropshire
algitha
harold
s
widow
and
blethwallon
and
all
his
welsh
the
white
mantles
swarming
along
chester
streets
not
as
usually
to
tear
and
ravage
like
the
of
their
own
rocks
but
fast
friends
by
blood
of
algitha
once
their
queen
on
penmaenmawr

the
admirable
description
of
the
tragedy
of
penmaenmawr
in
bulwer
s
edwin
the
young
earl
algitha
s
brother
hereward
s
nephew
he
must
be
with
them
too
if
he
were
a
man
eastward
round
stafford
and
the
centre
of
mercia
another
blaze
of
furious
english
valor
morcar
edwin
s
brother
must
be
there
as
their
earl
if
he
too
was
a
man
then
in
the
fens
and
kesteven
what
meant
this
news
that
hereward
of
omer
was
come
again
and
an
army
with
him
that
he
was
levying
war
on
all
frenchmen
in
the
name
of
sweyn
king
of
denmark
and
of
england
he
is
an
outlaw
a
desperado
a
boastful
thought
william
it
may
be
to
himself
he
found
out
in
after
years
that
he
had
mistaken
his
man
and
north
at
york
in
the
rear
of
those
three
insurrections
lay
gospatrick
waltheof
and
marlesweyn
with
the
northumbrian
host
durham
was
lost
and
comyn
burnt
therein
but
york
so
boasted
william
malet
could
hold
out
for
a
year
he
should
not
need
to
hold
out
for
so
long
and
last
and
worst
of
all
hung
on
the
eastern
coast
the
mighty
fleet
of
sweyn
who
claimed
england
as
his
of
right
the
foe
whom
he
had
part
feared
ever
since
he
set
foot
on
english
soil
a
collision
with
whom
had
been
inevitable
all
along
was
come
at
last
but
where
would
he
strike
his
blow
william
knew
it
may
be
that
the
danes
had
been
defeated
at
norwich
he
knew
doubt
it
not
for
his
spies
told
him
everything
that
they
had
purposed
entering
the
to
prevent
a
junction
between
them
and
hereward
was
impossible
he
must
prevent
a
junction
between
them
and
edwin
and
morcar
s
men
he
determined
it
seems
for
he
did
it
to
cut
the
english
line
in
two
and
marched
upon
stafford
as
its
centre
so
it
seems
for
all
records
of
these
campaigns
are
fragmentary
confused
contradictory
the
normans
fought
and
had
no
time
to
write
history
the
english
beaten
and
crushed
died
and
left
no
sign
the
only
chroniclers
of
the
time
are
monks
and
little
could
ordericus
vitalis
or
florence
of
worcester
or
he
of
peterborough
faithful
as
he
was
who
filled
up
the
sad
pages
of
the
chronicle
little
could
they
see
or
understand
of
the
masterly
strategy
which
was
conquering
all
england
for
norman
monks
in
order
that
they
following
the
army
like
black
ravens
might
feast
themselves
upon
the
prey
which
others
won
for
them
to
them
the
death
of
an
abbot
the
squabbles
of
a
monastery
the
journey
of
a
prelate
to
rome
are
more
important
than
the
manoeuvres
which
decided
the
life
and
freedom
of
tens
of
thousands
so
all
we
know
is
that
william
fell
upon
morcar
s
men
at
stafford
and
smote
them
with
a
great
destruction
rolling
the
fugitives
west
and
east
toward
edwin
perhaps
at
chester
certainly
toward
hereward
in
the
fens
at
stafford
met
him
the
fugitives
from
york
malet
his
wife
and
children
with
the
dreadful
news
that
the
danes
had
joined
gospatrick
and
that
york
was
lost
william
burst
into
fiendish
fury
he
accused
the
wretched
men
of
treason
he
cut
off
their
hands
thrust
out
their
eyes
threw
malet
into
prison
and
stormed
on
north
he
lay
at
pontefract
for
three
weeks
the
bridges
over
the
aire
were
broken
down
but
at
last
he
crossed
and
marched
on
york
no
man
opposed
him
the
danes
were
gone
down
to
the
humber
gospatrick
and
waltheof
s
hearts
had
failed
them
and
they
had
retired
before
the
great
captain
florence
of
worcester
says
that
william
bought
earl
osbiorn
off
giving
him
much
money
and
leave
to
forage
for
his
fleet
along
the
coast
and
that
osbiorn
was
outlawed
on
his
return
to
denmark
doubtless
william
would
have
so
done
if
he
could
doubtless
the
angry
and
disappointed
english
raised
such
accusations
against
the
earl
believing
them
to
be
true
but
is
not
the
simpler
cause
of
osbiorn
s
conduct
to
be
found
in
this
plain
fact
he
had
sailed
from
denmark
to
put
sweyn
his
brother
on
the
throne
he
found
on
his
arrival
that
gospatrick
and
waltheof
had
seized
it
in
the
name
of
edgar
atheling
what
had
he
to
do
more
in
england
save
what
he
did
go
out
into
the
humber
and
winter
safely
there
waiting
till
sweyn
should
come
with
reinforcements
in
the
spring
then
william
had
his
revenge
he
destroyed
in
the
language
of
scripture
the
life
of
the
far
and
wide
the
farms
were
burnt
over
their
owners
heads
the
growing
crops
upon
the
ground
the
horses
were
houghed
the
cattle
driven
off
while
of
human
death
and
misery
there
was
no
end
yorkshire
and
much
of
the
neighboring
counties
lay
waste
for
the
next
nine
years
it
did
not
recover
itself
fully
till
several
generations
after
the
danes
had
boasted
that
they
would
keep
their
yule
at
york
william
kept
his
yule
there
instead
he
sent
to
winchester
for
the
regalia
of
the
confessor
and
in
the
midst
of
the
blackened
ruins
while
the
english
for
miles
around
wandered
starving
in
the
snows
feeding
on
carrion
on
rats
and
mice
and
at
last
upon
each
other
s
corpses
he
sat
in
his
royal
robes
and
gave
away
the
lands
of
edwin
and
morcar
to
his
liegemen
and
thus
like
the
romans
from
whom
he
derived
both
his
strategy
and
his
civilization
he
made
a
solitude
and
called
it
he
did
not
give
away
waltheof
s
lands
and
only
part
of
gospatrick
s
he
wanted
gospatrick
he
loved
waltheof
and
wanted
him
likewise
therefore
through
the
desert
which
he
himself
had
made
he
forced
his
way
up
to
the
tees
a
second
time
over
moors
and
this
time
cuthbert
had
sent
no
fog
being
satisfied
presumably
with
william
s
orthodox
attachment
to
peter
and
rome
so
the
conqueror
treated
quietly
with
waltheof
and
gospatrick
who
lay
at
durham
gospatrick
got
back
his
ancestral
earldom
from
tees
to
tyne
and
paid
down
for
it
much
hard
money
and
treasure
bought
it
in
fact
he
said
waltheof
got
back
his
earldom
and
much
of
morcar
s
from
the
fens
to
the
tees
was
to
be
his
province
and
then
to
the
astonishment
alike
of
normans
and
english
and
it
may
be
of
himself
he
married
judith
the
conqueror
s
niece
and
became
once
more
william
s
loved
and
trusted
friend
or
slave
it
seems
inexplicable
at
first
sight
inexplicable
save
as
an
instance
of
that
fascination
which
the
strong
sometimes
exercise
over
the
weak
then
william
turned
southwest
edwin
wild
edric
the
dispossessed
thane
of
shropshire
and
the
wilder
blethwallon
and
his
welshmen
were
still
harrying
and
slaying
they
had
just
attacked
shrewsbury
william
would
come
upon
them
by
a
way
they
thought
not
of
so
over
the
backbone
of
england
by
way
probably
of
halifax
or
huddersfield
through
pathless
moors
and
bogs
down
towards
the
plains
of
lancashire
and
cheshire
he
pushed
over
and
on
his
soldiers
from
the
plains
of
sunny
france
could
not
face
the
cold
the
rain
the
bogs
the
hideous
gorges
the
valiant
peasants
still
the
finest
and
shrewdest
race
of
men
in
all
england
who
set
upon
them
in
wooded
glens
or
rolled
stones
on
them
from
the
limestone
crags
they
prayed
to
be
dismissed
to
go
home
cowards
might
go
back
said
william
he
should
go
on
if
he
could
not
ride
he
would
walk
whoever
lagged
he
would
be
and
cheered
by
his
example
the
army
at
last
debouched
upon
the
cheshire
flats
then
he
fell
upon
edwin
as
he
had
fallen
upon
morcar
he
drove
the
wild
welsh
through
the
pass
of
mold
and
up
into
their
native
hills
he
laid
all
waste
with
fire
and
sword
for
many
a
mile
as
testifies
to
this
day
he
strengthened
the
walls
of
chester
and
trampled
out
the
last
embers
of
rebellion
he
went
down
south
to
salisbury
king
of
england
once
again
why
did
he
not
push
on
at
once
against
the
one
rebellion
left
alight
that
of
hereward
and
his
fenmen
it
may
be
that
he
understood
him
and
them
it
may
be
that
he
meant
to
treat
with
sweyn
as
he
had
done
if
the
story
be
true
with
osbiorn
it
is
more
likely
that
he
could
do
no
more
that
his
army
after
so
swift
and
long
a
campaign
required
rest
it
may
be
that
the
time
of
service
of
many
of
his
mercenaries
was
expired
be
that
as
it
may
he
mustered
them
at
old
sarum
the
roman
british
burgh
which
still
stands
on
the
down
side
and
rewarded
them
according
to
their
deserts
from
the
lands
of
the
conquered
english
how
soon
hereward
knew
all
this
or
how
he
passed
the
winter
of
we
can
not
tell
but
to
him
it
must
have
been
a
winter
of
bitter
perplexity
it
was
impossible
to
get
information
from
edwin
and
news
from
york
was
almost
as
impossible
to
get
for
gilbert
of
ghent
stood
between
him
and
it
he
felt
himself
now
pent
in
all
but
trapped
since
he
had
set
foot
last
in
england
ugly
things
had
risen
up
on
which
he
had
calculated
too
little
namely
norman
castles
a
whole
ring
of
them
in
norfolk
and
suffolk
cut
him
off
from
the
south
a
castle
at
cambridge
closed
the
south
end
of
the
fens
another
at
bedford
the
western
end
while
lincoln
castle
to
the
north
cut
him
off
from
york
his
men
did
not
see
the
difficulty
and
wanted
him
to
march
towards
york
and
clear
all
lindsay
and
right
up
to
the
humber
gladly
would
he
have
done
so
when
he
heard
that
the
danes
were
wintering
in
the
humber
but
how
can
we
take
lincoln
castle
without
artillery
or
even
a
let
us
march
past
it
then
and
leave
it
ah
my
sons
said
hereward
laughing
sadly
do
you
suppose
that
the
mamzer
spends
his
time
and
englishmen
s
life
and
labor
in
heaping
up
those
great
stone
mountains
that
you
and
i
may
walk
past
them
they
are
put
there
just
to
prevent
our
walking
past
unless
we
choose
to
have
the
garrison
sallying
out
to
attack
our
rear
and
cut
us
off
from
home
and
carry
off
our
women
into
the
bargain
when
our
backs
are
the
english
swore
and
declared
that
they
had
never
thought
of
that
no
we
drink
too
much
ale
this
side
of
the
channel
to
think
of
that
or
of
anything
but
said
leofwin
prat
if
we
have
no
artillery
we
can
make
spoken
like
yourself
good
comrade
if
we
only
knew
i
know
said
torfrida
i
have
read
of
such
things
in
books
of
the
ancients
and
i
have
watched
them
making
continually
i
little
knew
why
or
that
i
should
ever
turn
what
is
there
that
you
do
not
know
cried
they
all
at
once
and
torfrida
actually
showed
herself
a
fair
practical
engineer
but
where
was
iron
to
come
from
iron
for
catapult
springs
iron
for
ram
heads
iron
for
bolts
and
bars
torfrida
said
hereward
you
are
wise
can
you
use
the
why
my
knight
because
there
might
be
iron
ore
in
the
wolds
and
if
you
could
find
it
by
the
rod
we
might
get
it
up
and
smelt
torfrida
said
humbly
that
she
would
try
and
walked
with
the
between
her
pretty
fingers
for
many
a
mile
in
wood
and
wold
wherever
the
ground
looked
red
and
rusty
but
she
never
found
any
iron
we
must
take
the
tires
off
the
said
leofwin
prat
but
how
will
the
carts
do
without
for
we
shall
want
them
if
we
in
provence
where
i
was
born
the
wheels
of
the
carts
are
made
out
of
one
round
piece
of
wood
could
we
not
cut
out
wheels
like
them
asked
torfrida
you
are
the
wise
woman
as
usual
said
hereward
torfrida
burst
into
a
violent
flood
of
tears
no
one
knew
why
there
came
over
her
a
vision
of
the
creaking
carts
and
the
little
sleek
oxen
and
with
their
canvas
mantles
tied
neatly
on
to
keep
off
heat
and
flies
lounging
on
with
their
light
load
of
vine
and
olive
twigs
beneath
the
blazing
southern
sun
when
should
she
see
the
sun
once
more
she
looked
up
at
the
brown
branches
overhead
howling
in
the
december
gale
and
down
at
the
brown
fen
below
dying
into
mist
and
darkness
as
the
low
december
sun
died
down
and
it
seemed
as
if
her
life
was
dying
down
with
it
there
would
be
no
more
sun
and
no
more
summers
for
her
upon
this
earth
none
certainly
for
her
poor
old
mother
her
southern
blood
was
chilling
more
and
more
beneath
the
bitter
sky
of
kesteven
the
fall
of
the
leaf
had
brought
with
it
rheumatism
ague
an
many
miseries
cunning
old
treated
the
french
lady
with
tonics
mugwort
and
bogbean
and
good
wine
enow
but
like
david
of
old
she
got
no
heat
and
before
came
she
had
prayed
herself
safely
out
of
this
world
and
into
the
world
to
come
and
torfrida
s
heart
was
the
more
light
when
she
saw
her
go
she
was
absorbed
utterly
in
hereward
and
his
plots
she
lived
for
nothing
else
and
clung
to
them
all
the
more
fiercely
the
more
desperate
they
seemed
so
that
small
band
of
gallant
men
labored
on
waiting
for
the
danes
and
trying
to
make
artillery
and
take
lincoln
keep
and
all
the
while
so
unequal
is
fortune
when
god
so
wills
throughout
the
southern
weald
from
hastings
to
every
copse
glared
with
every
glen
was
burrowed
with
iron
diggings
every
stamped
and
gurgled
night
and
day
smelting
and
forging
english
iron
wherewith
the
frenchmen
might
slay
englishmen
william
though
perhaps
he
knew
it
not
himself
had
in
securing
sussex
and
surrey
secured
the
then
great
of
england
and
an
unlimited
supply
of
weapons
and
to
that
circumstance
it
may
be
as
much
as
to
any
other
the
success
of
his
campaigns
may
be
due
it
must
have
been
in
one
of
these
december
days
that
a
handful
of
knights
came
through
the
bruneswold
mud
and
blood
bespattered
urging
on
tired
horses
as
men
desperate
and
foredone
and
the
foremost
of
them
all
when
he
saw
hereward
at
the
gate
of
bourne
leaped
down
and
threw
his
arms
round
his
neck
and
burst
into
bitter
weeping
hereward
i
know
you
though
you
know
me
not
i
am
your
nephew
morcar
algarsson
and
all
is
as
the
winter
ran
on
other
fugitives
came
in
mostly
of
rank
and
family
at
last
edwin
himself
came
young
and
fair
like
morcar
he
who
should
have
been
the
conqueror
s
for
whom
his
pined
as
he
pined
in
vain
where
were
sweyn
and
his
danes
whither
should
they
go
till
he
came
to
ely
answered
hereward
whether
or
not
it
was
his
wit
which
first
seized
on
the
military
capabilities
of
ely
is
not
told
leofric
the
deacon
who
is
likely
to
know
best
says
that
there
were
men
there
already
holding
theirs
out
against
william
and
that
they
sent
for
hereward
but
it
is
not
clear
from
his
words
whether
they
were
fugitives
or
merely
bold
abbot
thurstan
and
his
monks
it
is
but
probable
nevertheless
that
hereward
as
the
only
man
among
the
fugitives
who
ever
showed
any
ability
whatsoever
and
who
was
also
the
only
leader
save
morcar
connected
with
the
fen
conceived
the
famous
camp
of
refuge
and
made
it
a
formidable
fact
be
that
as
it
may
edwin
and
morcar
went
to
ely
and
there
joined
them
a
count
tosti
according
to
leofric
unknown
to
history
a
siward
barn
or
the
boy
who
had
been
dispossessed
of
lands
in
lincolnshire
and
other
valiant
and
noble
gentlemen
the
last
wrecks
of
the
english
aristocracy
and
there
they
sat
in
abbot
thurstan
s
hall
and
waited
for
sweyn
and
the
danes
but
the
worst
job
s
messenger
who
during
that
evil
winter
and
spring
came
into
the
fen
was
bishop
egelwin
of
durham
he
it
was
most
probably
who
brought
the
news
of
yorkshire
laid
waste
with
fire
and
sword
he
it
was
most
certainly
who
brought
the
worse
news
still
that
gospatrick
and
waltheof
were
gone
over
to
the
king
he
was
at
durham
seemingly
when
he
saw
that
and
fled
for
his
life
ere
evil
overtook
him
for
to
yield
to
william
that
brave
bishop
had
no
mind
but
when
hereward
heard
that
waltheof
was
married
to
the
conqueror
s
niece
he
smote
his
hands
together
and
cursed
him
and
the
mother
who
bore
him
to
siward
the
stout
could
thy
father
rise
from
his
grave
he
would
split
thy
craven
head
in
the
very
lap
of
the
a
hard
lap
will
he
find
it
hereward
said
torfrida
i
know
her
wanton
false
and
vain
heaven
grant
he
do
not
rue
the
day
he
ever
saw
her
heaven
grant
he
may
rue
it
would
that
her
bosom
were
knives
and
like
that
of
the
statue
in
the
see
what
he
has
done
for
us
he
is
earl
not
only
of
his
own
lands
but
he
has
taken
poor
morcar
s
too
and
half
his
earldom
he
is
earl
of
huntingdon
of
cambridge
they
say
of
this
ground
on
which
we
stand
what
right
have
i
here
now
how
can
i
call
on
a
single
man
to
arm
as
i
could
in
morcar
s
name
i
am
an
outlaw
here
and
a
robber
and
so
is
every
man
with
me
and
do
you
think
that
william
did
not
know
that
he
saw
well
enough
what
he
was
doing
when
he
set
up
that
great
brainless
idol
as
earl
again
he
wanted
to
split
up
the
danish
folk
and
he
has
done
it
the
northumbrians
will
stick
to
waltheof
they
think
him
a
mighty
hero
because
he
held
alone
with
his
own
axe
against
all
the
well
that
was
a
gallant
pish
we
are
all
gallant
men
we
english
it
is
not
courage
that
we
want
it
is
brains
so
the
yorkshire
and
lindsay
men
and
the
nottingham
men
too
will
go
with
waltheof
and
round
here
and
all
through
the
fens
every
coward
every
prudent
man
even
every
man
who
likes
to
be
within
the
law
and
feel
his
head
safe
on
his
shoulders
no
blame
to
him
will
draw
each
from
me
for
fear
of
this
new
earl
and
leave
us
to
end
as
a
handful
of
outlaws
i
see
it
all
as
william
sees
it
all
he
is
wise
enough
the
mamzer
and
so
is
his
father
belial
to
whom
he
will
go
home
some
day
yes
torfrida
he
went
on
after
a
pause
more
gently
but
in
a
tone
of
exquisite
sadness
you
were
right
as
you
always
are
i
am
no
match
for
that
man
i
see
it
i
never
said
that
only
only
you
told
me
again
and
again
that
he
was
the
wisest
man
on
and
yet
for
that
very
reason
i
bade
you
win
glory
without
end
by
defying
the
wisest
man
on
and
do
you
bid
me
do
it
still
god
knows
what
i
bid
said
torfrida
bursting
into
tears
let
me
go
pray
for
i
never
needed
it
hereward
watched
her
kneeling
as
he
sat
moody
all
but
desperate
then
he
glided
to
her
side
and
said
gently
teach
me
how
to
pray
torfrida
i
can
say
a
pater
or
an
ave
but
that
does
not
comfort
a
man
s
heart
as
far
as
i
could
ever
find
teach
me
to
pray
as
you
and
my
mother
and
she
put
her
arms
round
the
wild
man
s
neck
and
tried
to
teach
him
like
a
little
child
chapter
xxvi
how
hereward
fulfilled
his
words
to
the
prior
of
the
golden
borough
in
the
course
of
that
winter
died
good
abbot
brand
hereward
went
over
to
see
him
and
found
him
mumbling
to
himself
texts
of
isaiah
and
confessing
the
sins
of
his
people
woe
to
the
vineyard
that
bringeth
forth
wild
grapes
woe
to
those
that
join
house
to
house
and
field
to
field
like
us
and
the
godwinssons
and
every
man
that
could
till
we
stood
alone
in
the
many
houses
great
and
fair
shall
be
without
it
is
all
foretold
in
holy
writ
hereward
my
son
woe
to
those
who
rise
early
to
fill
themselves
with
strong
drink
and
the
tabret
and
harp
are
in
their
feasts
but
they
regard
not
the
works
of
the
therefore
my
people
are
gone
into
captivity
because
they
have
no
ah
those
frenchmen
have
knowledge
and
too
much
of
it
while
we
have
brains
filled
with
ale
instead
of
justice
therefore
hell
hath
enlarged
herself
and
opened
her
mouth
without
measure
and
all
go
down
into
it
one
by
one
and
dost
thou
think
thou
shalt
escape
hereward
thou
i
neither
know
nor
care
but
this
i
know
that
whithersoever
i
go
i
shall
go
sword
in
they
that
take
the
sword
shall
perish
by
the
sword
said
brand
and
blessed
hereward
and
died
a
week
after
came
news
that
thorold
of
malmesbury
was
coming
to
take
the
abbey
of
peterborough
and
had
got
as
far
as
stamford
with
a
right
royal
train
then
hereward
sent
abbot
thorold
word
that
if
he
or
his
frenchmen
put
foot
into
peterborough
he
hereward
would
burn
it
over
their
heads
and
that
if
he
rode
a
mile
beyond
stamford
town
he
should
walk
back
into
it
barefoot
in
his
shirt
whereon
thorold
abode
at
stamford
and
kept
up
his
spirits
by
singing
the
songs
of
roland
which
some
say
he
himself
composed
a
week
after
that
and
the
danes
were
come
a
mighty
fleet
with
sweyn
ulfsson
at
their
head
went
up
the
ouse
toward
ely
another
with
osbiorn
at
their
head
having
joined
them
off
the
mouth
of
the
humber
sailed
it
seems
up
the
nene
all
the
chivalry
of
denmark
and
ireland
was
come
and
with
it
all
the
chivalry
and
the
unchivalry
of
the
baltic
shores
vikings
from
jomsburg
and
arkona
gottlanders
from
wisby
and
with
them
savages
from
esthonia
finns
from
äland
letts
who
still
offered
in
the
forests
of
rugen
human
victims
to
the
swantowit
foul
hordes
in
and
primeval
filth
who
might
have
been
scented
from
hunstanton
cliff
ever
since
their
ships
had
rounded
the
skaw
hereward
hurried
to
them
with
all
his
men
he
was
anxious
of
course
to
prevent
their
plundering
the
landsfolk
as
they
went
and
that
the
savages
from
the
baltic
shore
would
certainly
do
if
they
could
however
reasonable
the
danes
orkneymen
and
irish
ostmen
might
be
food
of
course
they
must
take
where
they
could
find
it
but
outrages
were
not
a
necessary
though
a
too
common
adjunct
to
the
process
of
emptying
a
farmer
s
granaries
he
found
the
danes
in
a
dangerous
mood
sulky
and
disgusted
as
they
had
good
right
to
be
they
had
gone
to
the
humber
and
found
nothing
but
ruin
the
land
waste
the
french
holding
both
the
shores
of
the
humber
and
osbiorn
cowering
in
hardly
able
to
feed
his
men
they
had
come
to
conquer
england
and
nothing
was
left
for
them
to
conquer
but
a
few
then
they
would
have
what
there
was
in
them
every
one
knew
that
gold
grew
up
in
england
out
of
the
ground
wherever
a
monk
put
his
foot
and
they
would
plunder
crowland
their
forefathers
had
done
it
and
had
fared
none
the
worse
english
gold
they
would
have
if
they
could
not
get
fat
english
manors
no
not
crowland
said
hereward
any
place
but
crowland
endowed
and
honored
by
canute
the
great
crowland
whose
abbot
was
a
danish
nobleman
whose
monks
were
danes
to
a
man
of
their
own
flesh
and
blood
canute
s
soul
would
rise
up
in
valhalla
and
curse
them
if
they
took
the
value
of
a
penny
from
guthlac
guthlac
was
their
good
friend
he
would
send
them
bread
meat
ale
all
they
needed
but
woe
to
the
man
who
set
foot
upon
his
hereward
sent
off
messengers
to
crowland
warning
all
to
be
ready
to
escape
into
the
fens
and
entreating
ulfketyl
to
empty
his
storehouses
into
his
barges
and
send
food
to
the
danes
ere
a
day
was
past
and
ulfketyl
worked
hard
and
well
till
a
string
of
barges
wound
its
way
through
the
fens
laden
with
beeves
and
bread
and
in
plenty
and
with
monks
too
who
welcomed
the
danes
as
their
brethren
talked
to
them
in
their
own
tongue
blessed
them
in
guthlac
s
name
as
the
saviors
of
england
and
went
home
again
chanting
so
sweetly
their
thanks
to
heaven
for
their
safety
that
the
wild
vikings
were
awed
and
agreed
that
guthlac
s
men
were
wise
folk
and
and
that
it
was
a
shame
to
do
them
harm
but
plunder
they
must
have
and
plunder
you
shall
have
said
hereward
as
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
i
will
show
you
the
way
to
the
golden
borough
the
richest
minster
in
england
and
all
the
treasures
of
the
golden
borough
shall
be
yours
if
you
will
treat
englishmen
as
friends
and
spare
the
people
of
the
it
was
a
great
crime
in
the
eyes
of
men
of
that
time
a
great
crime
taken
simply
in
hereward
s
own
eyes
but
necessity
knows
no
law
something
the
danes
must
have
and
ought
to
have
and
peter
s
gold
was
better
in
their
purses
than
in
that
of
thorold
and
his
french
monks
so
he
led
them
across
the
fens
and
side
rivers
till
they
came
into
the
old
nene
which
men
call
catwater
and
muscal
now
as
he
passed
nomanslandhirne
and
the
mouth
of
the
crowland
river
he
trembled
and
trusted
that
the
danes
did
not
know
that
they
were
within
three
miles
of
guthlac
s
sanctuary
but
they
went
on
ignorant
and
up
the
muscal
till
they
saw
peter
s
towers
on
the
wooded
rise
and
behind
them
the
great
forest
which
now
is
milton
park
there
were
two
parties
in
peterborough
minster
a
smaller
faction
of
english
a
larger
one
who
favored
william
and
the
french
customs
with
prior
herluin
at
their
head
herluin
wanted
not
for
foresight
and
he
knew
that
evil
was
coming
on
him
he
knew
that
the
danes
were
in
the
fen
he
knew
that
hereward
was
with
them
he
knew
that
they
had
come
to
crowland
hereward
could
never
mean
to
let
them
sack
it
peterborough
must
be
their
point
and
herluin
set
his
teeth
like
a
bold
man
determined
to
abide
the
worst
and
barred
and
barricaded
every
gate
and
door
that
night
a
hapless
churchwarden
ywar
was
his
name
might
have
been
seen
galloping
through
milton
and
castor
hanglands
and
on
by
barnack
quarries
over
southorpe
heath
with
saddlebags
of
huge
size
stuffed
with
gospels
cassocks
and
other
garments
and
such
other
small
things
as
he
could
carry
and
he
came
before
day
to
stamford
where
abbot
thorold
lay
at
his
ease
in
his
inn
with
his
d
asleep
in
the
hall
and
the
churchwarden
knocked
them
up
and
drew
abbot
thorold
s
curtains
with
a
face
such
as
his
who
drew
priam
s
curtains
in
the
dead
of
night
and
would
have
told
him
half
his
troy
was
burned
and
told
abbot
thorold
that
the
monks
of
peterborough
had
sent
him
and
that
unless
he
saddled
and
rode
his
best
that
night
with
his
meinie
of
his
golden
borough
would
be
even
as
troy
town
by
morning
light
a
moi
hommes
d
armes
shouted
thorold
as
he
used
to
shout
whenever
he
wanted
to
scourge
his
wretched
english
monks
at
malmesbury
into
some
french
fashion
the
men
leaped
up
and
poured
in
growling
take
me
this
monk
and
kick
him
into
the
street
for
waking
me
with
such
but
gracious
lord
the
outlaws
will
surely
burn
peterborough
and
folks
said
that
you
were
a
mighty
man
of
so
i
am
but
if
i
were
roland
oliver
and
turpin
rolled
into
one
how
am
i
to
fight
hereward
and
the
danes
with
forty
answer
me
that
thou
english
porker
kick
him
and
ywar
was
kicked
into
the
cold
while
thorold
raged
up
and
down
his
chamber
in
mantle
and
slippers
wringing
his
hands
over
the
treasure
of
the
golden
borough
snatched
from
his
fingers
just
as
he
was
closing
them
upon
it
that
night
the
monks
of
peterborough
prayed
in
the
minster
till
the
long
hours
passed
into
the
short
the
poor
corrodiers
and
other
servants
of
the
monastery
fled
from
the
town
outside
into
the
milton
woods
the
monks
prayed
on
inside
till
an
hour
after
matin
when
the
first
flush
of
the
summer
s
dawn
began
to
show
in
the
northeastern
sky
they
heard
mingling
with
their
own
chant
another
chant
which
peterborough
had
not
heard
since
it
was
medehampstead
three
hundred
years
ago
the
terrible
the
of
the
vikings
of
the
north
their
chant
stopped
of
itself
with
blanched
faces
and
trembling
knees
they
fled
regardless
of
all
discipline
up
into
the
minster
tower
and
from
the
leads
looked
out
northeastward
on
the
fen
the
first
rays
of
the
summer
sun
were
just
streaming
over
the
vast
sheet
of
emerald
and
glittering
upon
the
winding
river
and
on
a
winding
line
too
seemingly
endless
of
scarlet
coats
and
shields
black
hulls
gilded
poops
and
vanes
and
and
the
flash
and
foam
of
innumerable
oars
and
nearer
and
louder
came
the
like
thunder
working
up
from
the
northeast
and
mingled
with
it
that
grim
yet
laughing
heysaa
which
bespoke
in
its
very
note
the
revelry
of
slaughter
the
ships
had
all
their
sails
on
deck
but
as
they
came
nearer
the
monks
could
see
the
banners
of
the
two
foremost
vessels
the
one
was
the
red
and
white
of
the
terrible
dannebrog
the
other
the
scarcely
less
terrible
white
bear
of
hereward
he
will
burn
the
minster
he
has
vowed
to
do
it
as
a
child
he
vowed
and
he
must
do
it
in
this
very
minster
the
fiend
entered
into
him
and
possessed
him
and
to
this
minster
has
the
fiend
brought
him
back
to
do
his
will
satan
my
brethren
having
a
special
spite
as
must
needs
be
against
peter
rock
and
pillar
of
the
holy
church
chose
out
and
inspired
this
man
even
from
his
mother
s
womb
that
he
might
be
the
foe
and
robber
of
peter
and
the
hater
of
all
who
like
my
humility
honor
him
and
strive
to
bring
this
english
land
into
due
obedience
to
that
blessed
apostle
bring
forth
the
relics
my
brethren
bring
forth
above
all
things
those
filings
of
peter
s
own
chains
the
special
glory
of
our
monastery
and
perhaps
its
safeguard
this
some
such
bombast
would
any
monk
of
those
days
have
talked
in
like
case
and
yet
so
strange
a
thing
is
man
he
might
have
been
withal
like
herluin
a
shrewd
and
valiant
man
they
brought
out
all
the
relics
they
brought
out
the
filings
themselves
in
a
box
of
gold
they
held
them
out
over
the
walls
at
the
ships
and
called
on
all
the
saints
to
whom
they
belonged
but
they
stopped
that
line
of
scarlet
black
and
gold
as
much
as
their
spiritual
descendants
stop
the
of
vesuvius
when
they
hold
out
similar
matters
at
them
with
a
hope
unchanged
by
the
experience
of
eight
hundred
years
the
heysaa
rose
louder
and
nearer
the
danes
were
coming
and
they
came
and
all
the
while
a
thousand
skylarks
rose
from
off
the
fen
and
chanted
their
own
chant
aloft
as
if
appealing
to
heaven
against
that
which
man
s
greed
and
man
s
rage
and
man
s
superstition
had
made
of
this
fair
earth
of
god
the
relics
had
been
brought
out
but
as
they
would
not
work
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
put
them
back
again
and
hide
them
safe
lest
they
should
bow
down
like
bel
and
stoop
like
nebo
and
be
carried
like
them
into
captivity
themselves
being
worth
a
very
large
sum
of
money
in
the
eyes
of
the
more
christian
part
of
the
danish
host
then
to
hide
the
treasures
as
well
as
they
could
which
says
the
chronicle
they
hid
somewhere
in
the
steeple
the
danes
were
landing
now
the
shout
which
they
gave
as
they
leaped
on
shore
made
the
hearts
of
the
poor
monks
sink
low
would
they
be
murdered
as
well
as
robbed
perhaps
not
probably
not
hereward
would
see
to
that
and
some
wanted
to
capitulate
herluin
would
not
hear
of
it
they
were
safe
enough
peter
s
relic
might
not
have
worked
a
miracle
on
the
spot
but
it
must
have
done
something
peter
had
been
appealed
to
on
his
honor
and
on
his
honor
he
must
surely
take
the
matter
up
at
all
events
the
walls
and
gates
were
strong
and
the
danes
had
no
artillery
let
them
howl
and
rage
round
the
holy
place
till
abbot
thorold
and
the
frenchmen
of
the
country
rose
and
drove
them
to
their
ships
in
that
last
thought
the
cunning
norman
was
not
so
far
wrong
the
danes
pushed
up
through
the
little
town
and
to
the
minster
gates
but
entrance
was
impossible
and
they
prowled
round
and
round
like
raging
wolves
about
a
winter
steading
but
found
no
crack
of
entry
prior
herluin
grew
bold
and
coming
to
the
leads
of
the
gateway
tower
looked
over
cautiously
and
holding
up
a
certain
most
sacred
emblem
not
to
be
profaned
in
these
pages
cursed
them
in
the
name
of
his
whole
pantheon
aha
herluin
are
you
there
asked
a
short
square
man
in
gay
armor
have
you
forgotten
the
outside
bolldyke
gate
and
how
you
bade
light
it
under
me
thirty
years
since
thou
art
winter
and
the
prior
uttered
what
would
be
considered
from
any
but
a
churchman
s
lips
a
blasphemous
and
bloodthirsty
curse
but
which
was
as
their
writings
sufficiently
testify
merely
one
of
the
lawful
weapons
or
arts
of
those
christians
who
were
forbidden
to
fight
the
other
weapon
or
art
being
that
of
lying
aha
that
goes
like
rain
off
a
duck
s
back
to
one
who
has
been
a
minster
scholar
in
his
time
you
danes
ostmen
down
if
you
shoot
at
that
man
i
ll
cut
your
heads
off
he
is
the
oldest
foe
i
have
in
the
world
and
the
only
one
who
ever
hit
me
without
my
hitting
him
again
and
nobody
shall
touch
him
but
me
so
down
bows
i
the
danes
humorous
all
of
them
saw
that
there
was
a
jest
toward
and
perhaps
some
earnest
too
and
joined
in
jeering
the
prior
herluin
had
ducked
his
head
behind
the
parapet
not
from
cowardice
but
simply
because
he
had
on
no
mail
and
might
be
shot
any
moment
but
when
he
heard
winter
forbid
them
to
touch
him
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
gave
his
old
pupil
as
good
as
he
brought
with
his
sharp
swift
norman
priest
s
tongue
he
sneered
he
jeered
he
scolded
he
argued
and
then
threatened
suddenly
changing
his
tone
in
words
of
real
eloquence
he
appealed
to
the
superstitions
of
his
hearers
he
threatened
them
with
supernatural
vengeance
some
of
them
began
to
slink
away
frightened
peter
was
an
ill
man
to
have
a
blood
feud
with
winter
stood
laughing
and
jeering
again
for
full
ten
minutes
at
last
i
asked
and
you
have
not
answered
have
you
forgotten
the
outside
bolldyke
gate
for
if
you
have
hereward
has
not
he
has
piled
it
against
the
gate
and
it
should
be
burnt
through
by
this
time
go
and
herluin
disappeared
with
a
curse
now
you
said
winter
springing
up
we
ll
to
the
bolldyke
gate
and
all
start
the
bolldyke
gate
was
on
fire
and
more
so
were
the
suburbs
there
was
no
time
to
save
them
as
hereward
would
gladly
have
done
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
corrodiers
they
must
go
on
to
the
bolldyke
gate
who
cared
to
put
out
flames
behind
him
with
all
the
treasures
of
golden
borough
before
him
in
a
few
minutes
all
the
town
was
alight
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
monastery
likewise
a
fire
is
detestable
enough
at
all
times
but
most
detestable
by
day
at
night
it
is
customary
a
work
of
darkness
which
lights
up
the
dark
picturesque
magnificent
with
a
fitness
tartarean
and
diabolic
but
under
a
glaring
sun
amid
green
fields
and
blue
skies
all
its
wickedness
is
revealed
without
its
beauty
you
see
its
works
and
little
more
the
flame
is
hardly
noticed
all
that
is
seen
is
a
canker
eating
up
god
s
works
cracking
the
bones
of
its
prey
for
that
horrible
cracking
is
uglier
than
all
glares
cruelly
and
shamelessly
under
the
very
eye
of
the
great
honest
kindly
sun
and
that
felt
hereward
as
he
saw
peterborough
burn
he
could
not
put
his
thoughts
into
words
as
men
of
this
day
can
so
much
the
better
for
him
perhaps
but
he
felt
all
the
more
intensely
as
did
men
of
his
day
the
things
he
could
not
speak
all
he
said
was
aside
to
winter
it
is
a
dark
job
i
wish
it
had
been
done
in
the
and
winter
knew
what
he
meant
then
the
men
rushed
into
the
bolldyke
gate
while
hereward
and
winter
stood
and
looked
with
their
men
whom
they
kept
close
together
waiting
their
commands
the
danes
and
their
allies
cared
not
for
the
great
glowing
heap
of
peat
they
cared
not
for
each
other
hardly
for
themselves
they
rushed
into
the
gap
they
thrust
the
glowing
heap
inward
through
the
gateway
with
their
lances
they
thrust
each
other
down
into
it
and
trampled
over
them
to
fall
themselves
rising
scorched
and
withered
and
yet
struggling
on
toward
the
gold
of
the
golden
borough
one
savage
lett
caught
another
round
the
waist
and
hurled
him
bodily
into
the
fire
crying
in
his
wild
tongue
you
will
make
a
good
for
that
is
not
fair
quoth
hereward
and
clove
him
to
the
chine
it
was
wild
work
but
the
golden
borough
was
won
we
must
in
now
and
save
the
monks
said
hereward
and
dashed
over
the
embers
he
was
only
just
in
time
in
the
midst
of
the
great
court
were
all
the
monks
huddled
together
like
a
flock
of
sheep
some
kneeling
most
weeping
bitterly
after
the
fashion
of
monks
only
herluin
stood
in
front
of
them
at
bay
a
lofty
crucifix
in
his
hand
he
had
no
mind
to
weep
but
with
a
face
of
calm
and
bitter
wrath
he
preferred
words
of
peace
and
entreaty
they
were
what
the
time
needed
therefore
they
should
be
given
he
would
write
to
bishop
egelsin
to
excommunicate
with
bell
book
and
candle
to
the
lowest
pit
of
tartarus
all
who
had
done
the
deed
but
he
spoke
them
fair
however
his
fair
speeches
profited
little
not
being
understood
by
a
horde
of
letts
and
finns
who
howled
and
bayed
at
him
and
tried
to
tear
the
crucifix
from
his
hands
but
feared
the
white
they
were
already
gaining
courage
from
their
own
yells
in
a
moment
more
blood
would
have
been
shed
and
then
a
general
massacre
must
have
ensued
hereward
saw
it
and
shouting
after
me
hereward
s
men
a
bear
a
bear
swung
letts
and
finns
right
and
left
like
and
stood
face
to
face
with
herluin
an
angry
finn
smote
him
on
the
full
with
a
stone
axe
he
staggered
and
then
looked
round
and
laughed
fool
hast
thou
not
heard
that
hereward
s
armor
was
forged
by
dwarfs
in
the
off
and
hunt
for
gold
or
it
will
be
all
the
finn
who
was
astonished
at
getting
no
more
from
his
blow
than
a
few
sparks
and
expected
instant
death
in
return
took
the
hint
and
vanished
jabbering
as
did
his
fellows
now
herluin
the
frenchman
said
hereward
now
hereward
the
robber
of
saints
said
herluin
it
was
a
fine
sight
the
soldier
and
the
churchman
the
englishman
and
the
frenchman
the
man
of
the
then
world
and
the
man
of
the
then
church
pitted
fairly
face
to
face
hereward
tried
for
one
moment
to
stare
down
herluin
but
those
terrible
before
which
vikings
had
quailed
turned
off
harmless
from
the
more
terrible
glance
of
the
man
who
believed
himself
backed
by
the
maker
of
the
universe
and
all
the
hierarchy
of
heaven
a
sharp
unlovely
face
it
was
though
like
many
a
great
churchman
s
face
of
those
days
it
was
neither
thin
nor
haggard
but
rather
round
sleek
of
a
puffy
and
unwholesome
paleness
but
there
was
a
thin
lip
above
a
broad
square
jaw
which
showed
that
herluin
was
neither
fool
nor
coward
a
robber
and
a
child
of
belial
thou
hast
been
from
thy
cradle
and
a
robber
and
a
child
of
belial
thou
art
now
dare
thy
last
iniquity
and
slay
the
servants
of
peter
on
peter
s
altar
with
thy
worthy
comrades
the
heathen
saracens
footnote
the
danes
were
continually
mistaken
by
norman
churchmen
for
saracens
and
the
saracens
considered
to
be
idolaters
a
maumee
or
idol
means
a
mahomet
and
set
up
mahound
with
them
in
the
holy
hereward
laughed
so
jolly
a
laugh
that
the
prior
was
taken
aback
slay
peter
s
rats
i
kill
men
not
monks
there
shall
not
a
hair
of
your
head
be
touched
here
hereward
s
men
march
these
traitors
and
their
french
prior
safe
out
of
the
walls
and
into
milton
woods
to
look
after
their
poor
corrodiers
and
comfort
their
souls
after
they
have
ruined
their
bodies
by
their
treason
out
of
this
place
i
stir
not
here
i
am
and
here
i
will
live
or
die
as
peter
shall
send
but
as
he
spoke
he
was
precipitated
rudely
forward
and
hurried
almost
into
hereward
s
arms
the
whole
body
of
monks
when
they
heard
hereward
s
words
cared
to
hear
no
more
but
desperate
between
fear
and
joy
rushed
forward
bearing
away
their
prior
in
the
midst
so
go
the
rats
out
of
peterborough
and
so
is
my
dream
fulfilled
now
for
the
treasure
and
then
to
but
herluin
burst
himself
clear
of
the
frantic
mob
of
monks
and
turned
back
on
hereward
thou
wast
dubbed
knight
in
that
church
i
know
it
man
and
that
church
and
the
relics
of
the
saints
in
it
are
safe
therefore
hereward
gives
his
that
but
not
that
only
if
thou
art
a
true
knight
as
thou
holdest
hereward
growled
savagely
and
made
an
ugly
step
toward
herluin
that
was
a
point
which
he
would
not
have
questioned
then
behave
as
a
knight
and
save
save
as
the
monks
dragged
him
away
save
the
hospice
there
are
women
ladies
there
shouted
he
as
he
was
borne
off
they
never
met
again
on
earth
but
both
comforted
themselves
in
after
years
that
two
old
enemies
last
deed
in
common
had
been
one
of
mercy
hereward
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
if
the
wild
letts
even
the
jomsburgers
had
got
in
all
was
lost
he
rushed
to
the
door
it
was
not
yet
burst
but
a
bench
swung
by
strong
arms
was
battering
it
in
fast
winter
geri
siwards
to
me
hereward
s
men
stand
back
fellows
here
are
friends
here
inside
if
you
do
not
i
ll
cut
you
but
in
vain
the
door
was
burst
and
in
poured
the
savage
mob
hereward
unable
to
stop
them
headed
them
or
pretended
to
do
so
with
five
or
six
of
his
own
men
round
him
and
went
into
the
hall
on
the
rushes
lay
some
grooms
they
were
butchered
instantly
simply
because
they
were
there
hereward
saw
but
could
not
prevent
he
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
to
the
foot
of
the
wooden
stair
which
led
to
the
upper
floor
guard
the
winter
and
he
ran
up
two
women
cowered
upon
the
floor
shrieking
and
praying
with
hands
clasped
over
their
heads
he
saw
that
the
arms
of
one
of
them
were
of
the
most
exquisite
whiteness
and
judging
her
to
be
the
lady
bent
over
her
lady
you
are
safe
i
will
protect
you
i
am
she
sprang
up
and
threw
herself
with
a
scream
into
his
arms
hereward
hereward
save
me
i
am
alftruda
said
hereward
it
was
alftruda
if
possible
more
beautiful
than
ever
i
have
got
you
she
cried
i
am
safe
now
take
me
away
out
of
this
horrible
place
take
me
into
the
woods
anywhere
only
do
not
let
me
be
burnt
here
stifled
like
a
rat
give
me
air
give
me
water
and
she
clung
to
him
so
madly
that
hereward
as
he
held
her
in
his
arms
and
gazed
on
her
extraordinary
beauty
forgot
torfrida
for
the
second
time
but
there
was
no
time
to
indulge
in
evil
thoughts
even
had
any
crossed
his
mind
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
commanding
the
maid
to
follow
hurried
down
the
stair
winter
and
the
siwards
were
defending
the
foot
with
swinging
blades
the
savages
were
howling
round
like
curs
about
a
bull
and
when
hereward
appeared
above
with
the
women
there
was
a
loud
yell
of
rage
and
envy
he
should
not
have
the
women
to
himself
they
would
share
the
plunder
equally
was
shouted
in
half
a
dozen
barbarous
dialects
have
you
left
any
valuables
in
the
chamber
whispered
he
to
alftruda
yes
jewels
robes
let
them
have
all
only
save
me
let
me
pass
roared
hereward
there
is
rich
booty
in
the
room
above
and
you
may
have
it
as
these
ladies
ransom
them
you
do
not
touch
back
i
say
let
me
pass
and
he
rushed
forward
winter
and
the
housecarles
formed
round
him
and
the
women
and
hurried
down
the
hall
while
the
savages
hurried
up
the
ladder
to
quarrel
over
their
spoil
they
were
out
in
the
and
safe
for
the
moment
but
whither
should
he
take
her
to
earl
osbiorn
said
one
of
the
siwards
but
how
to
find
him
there
is
bishop
christiern
and
the
bishop
was
caught
and
stopped
this
is
an
evil
day
s
work
sir
then
help
to
mend
it
by
taking
care
of
these
ladies
like
a
man
of
and
he
explained
the
case
you
may
come
safely
with
me
my
poor
lambs
said
the
bishop
i
am
glad
to
find
something
to
do
fit
for
a
churchman
to
me
my
but
they
were
all
off
plundering
we
will
stand
by
you
and
the
ladies
and
see
you
safe
down
to
the
ships
said
winter
and
so
they
went
off
hereward
would
gladly
have
gone
with
them
as
alftruda
piteously
entreated
him
but
he
heard
his
name
called
on
every
side
in
angry
tones
who
wants
hereward
earl
osbiorn
here
he
those
scoundrel
monks
have
hidden
all
the
altar
furniture
if
you
wish
to
save
them
from
being
tortured
to
death
you
had
best
find
hereward
ran
with
him
into
the
cathedral
it
was
a
hideous
sight
torn
books
and
vestments
broken
tabernacle
work
foul
savages
swarming
in
and
out
of
every
dark
aisle
and
cloister
like
wolves
in
search
of
prey
five
or
six
ruffians
aloft
upon
the
rood
screen
one
tearing
the
golden
crown
from
the
head
of
the
crucifix
another
the
golden
footstool
from
its
feet
footnote
the
crucifix
was
probably
of
the
greek
pattern
in
which
the
figure
stood
upon
a
flat
slab
projecting
from
the
cross
as
hereward
came
up
crucifix
and
man
fell
together
crashing
upon
the
pavement
amid
shouts
of
brutal
laughter
he
hurried
past
them
shuddering
into
the
choir
the
altar
was
bare
the
golden
pallium
which
covered
it
gone
it
may
be
in
the
crypt
below
i
suppose
the
monks
keep
their
relics
there
said
osbiorn
no
not
there
do
not
touch
the
relics
would
you
have
the
curse
of
all
the
saints
stay
i
know
an
old
it
may
be
there
up
into
the
steeple
with
and
in
a
chamber
in
the
steeple
they
found
the
golden
pall
and
treasures
countless
and
wonderful
we
had
better
keep
the
knowledge
of
this
to
ourselves
awhile
said
earl
osbiorn
looking
with
greedy
eyes
on
a
heap
of
wealth
such
as
he
had
never
beheld
before
not
we
hereward
is
a
man
of
his
word
and
we
will
share
and
share
and
he
turned
and
went
down
the
narrow
winding
stair
earl
osbiorn
gave
one
look
at
his
turned
back
an
evil
spirit
of
covetousness
came
over
him
and
he
smote
hereward
full
and
strong
upon
the
the
sword
turned
upon
the
magic
helm
and
the
sparks
flashed
out
bright
and
wide
earl
osbiorn
shrunk
back
appalled
and
trembling
aha
said
hereward
without
looking
round
i
never
thought
there
would
be
loose
stones
in
the
roof
here
up
here
vikings
berserker
and
all
here
jutlanders
jomsburgers
letts
finns
witches
sons
and
devils
sons
all
here
cried
he
while
osbiorn
profited
by
that
moment
to
thrust
an
especially
brilliant
jewel
into
his
boot
here
is
gold
here
is
the
dwarfs
work
come
up
and
take
your
polotaswarf
you
would
not
get
a
richer
out
of
the
kaiser
s
treasury
here
wolves
and
ravens
eat
gold
drink
gold
roll
in
gold
and
know
that
hereward
is
a
man
of
his
word
and
pays
his
soldiers
wages
royally
they
rushed
up
the
narrow
stair
trampling
each
other
to
death
and
thrust
hereward
and
the
earl
choking
into
a
corner
the
room
was
so
full
for
a
few
moments
that
some
died
in
it
hereward
and
osbiorn
protected
by
their
strong
armor
forced
their
way
to
the
narrow
window
and
breathed
through
it
looking
out
upon
the
sea
of
flame
below
that
was
an
unlucky
blow
said
hereward
that
fell
upon
my
very
unlucky
i
saw
it
coming
but
had
no
time
to
warn
you
why
do
you
hold
my
wrist
men
s
daggers
are
apt
to
get
loose
at
such
times
as
what
do
you
mean
and
earl
osbiorn
went
from
him
and
into
the
now
thinning
press
soon
only
a
few
remained
to
search
by
the
glare
of
the
flames
for
what
their
fellows
might
have
overlooked
now
the
play
is
played
out
said
hereward
we
may
as
well
go
down
and
to
our
some
drunken
ruffians
would
have
burnt
the
church
for
mere
mischief
but
osbiorn
as
well
as
hereward
stopped
that
and
gradually
they
got
the
men
down
to
the
ships
some
drunk
some
struggling
under
plunder
some
cursing
and
quarrelling
because
nothing
had
fallen
to
their
lot
it
was
a
hideous
scene
but
one
to
which
hereward
as
well
as
osbiorn
was
too
well
accustomed
to
see
aught
in
it
save
an
hour
s
inevitable
trouble
in
getting
the
men
on
board
the
monks
had
all
fled
only
leofwin
the
long
was
left
and
he
lay
sick
in
the
infirmary
whether
he
was
burned
therein
or
saved
by
hereward
s
men
is
not
told
and
so
was
the
golden
borough
sacked
and
burnt
now
then
whither
the
danes
were
to
go
to
ely
and
join
the
army
there
hereward
would
march
on
to
stamford
secure
that
town
if
he
could
then
to
huntingdon
to
secure
it
likewise
and
on
to
ely
afterwards
you
will
not
leave
me
among
these
savages
said
alftruda
heaven
forbid
you
shall
come
with
me
as
far
as
stamford
and
then
i
will
set
you
on
your
my
way
said
alftruda
in
a
bitter
and
hopeless
tone
hereward
mounted
her
on
a
good
horse
and
rode
beside
her
looking
and
he
well
knew
it
a
very
perfect
knight
soon
they
began
to
talk
what
had
brought
alftruda
to
peterborough
of
all
places
on
earth
a
woman
s
fortune
because
i
am
rich
and
some
say
fair
i
am
a
puppet
and
a
slave
a
prey
i
was
going
back
to
my
to
have
you
been
away
from
him
then
what
do
you
not
know
how
should
i
know
lady
yes
most
true
how
should
hereward
know
anything
about
alftruda
but
i
will
tell
you
maybe
you
may
not
care
to
hear
about
you
anything
i
have
often
longed
to
know
how
what
you
were
is
it
possible
is
there
one
human
being
left
on
earth
who
cares
to
hear
about
alftruda
then
listen
you
know
when
gospatrick
fled
to
scotland
his
sons
went
with
him
young
gospatrick
waltheof
footnote
this
waltheof
gospatricksson
must
not
be
confounded
with
waltheof
siwardsson
the
young
earl
he
became
a
wild
border
chieftain
then
baron
of
atterdale
and
then
gave
atterdale
to
his
sister
queen
ethelreda
and
turned
monk
and
at
last
abbot
of
crowland
crawling
home
poor
fellow
like
many
another
to
die
in
peace
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
danes
and
he
dolfin
ethelreda
his
girl
went
too
and
she
is
to
marry
they
say
duncan
malcolm
s
eldest
son
by
ingebiorg
so
gospatrick
will
find
himself
some
day
of
the
king
of
i
will
warrant
him
to
find
his
nest
well
lined
wherever
he
be
but
of
yourself
i
refused
to
go
i
could
not
face
again
that
bleak
black
north
beside
but
that
is
no
concern
of
hereward
s
hereward
was
on
the
point
of
saying
can
anything
concern
you
and
not
be
interesting
to
me
but
she
went
on
i
refused
and
and
he
misused
you
asked
he
fiercely
better
if
he
had
better
if
he
had
tied
me
to
his
stirrup
and
scourged
me
along
into
scotland
than
have
left
me
to
new
dangers
and
to
old
what
temptations
alftruda
did
not
answer
but
went
on
he
told
me
in
his
lofty
scots
fashion
that
i
was
free
to
do
what
i
list
that
he
had
long
since
seen
that
i
cared
not
for
him
and
that
he
would
find
many
a
fairer
lady
in
his
own
there
he
lied
so
you
did
not
care
for
him
he
is
a
noble
what
is
that
to
me
women
s
hearts
are
not
to
be
bought
and
sold
with
their
bodies
as
i
was
sold
care
for
him
i
care
for
no
creature
upon
earth
once
i
cared
for
hereward
like
a
silly
child
now
i
care
not
even
for
hereward
was
sorry
to
hear
that
men
are
vainer
than
women
just
as
peacocks
are
vainer
than
peahens
and
hereward
was
alas
for
him
a
specially
vain
man
of
course
for
him
to
fall
in
love
with
alftruda
would
have
been
a
shameful
sin
he
would
not
have
committed
it
for
all
the
treasures
of
constantinople
but
it
was
a
not
unpleasant
thought
that
alftruda
should
fall
in
love
with
him
but
he
only
said
tenderly
and
courteously
alas
poor
lady
poor
lady
too
true
that
last
for
whither
am
i
going
now
back
to
that
man
once
to
dolfin
to
my
master
like
a
runaway
slave
i
went
down
south
to
queen
matilda
i
knew
her
well
and
she
was
kind
to
me
as
she
is
to
all
things
that
breathe
but
now
that
gospatrick
is
come
into
the
king
s
grace
again
and
has
bought
the
earldom
of
northumbria
from
tweed
to
tyne
bought
the
earldom
that
has
he
and
paid
for
it
right
traitor
and
fool
he
will
not
keep
it
seven
years
the
frenchman
will
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
and
cheat
him
out
of
earldom
and
money
the
which
william
did
within
three
years
may
it
be
so
but
when
he
came
into
the
king
s
grace
he
must
needs
demand
me
back
in
his
son
s
what
does
dolfin
want
with
you
his
father
wants
my
money
and
stipulated
for
it
with
the
king
and
besides
i
suppose
i
am
a
pretty
plaything
enough
you
you
are
divine
perfect
dolfin
is
right
how
could
a
man
who
had
once
enjoyed
you
live
without
you
alftruda
laughed
a
laugh
full
of
meaning
but
what
that
meaning
was
hereward
could
not
divine
so
now
she
said
what
hereward
has
to
do
as
a
true
and
courteous
knight
is
to
give
alftruda
safe
conduct
and
if
he
can
a
guard
and
to
deliver
her
up
loyally
and
knightly
to
his
old
friend
and
dolfin
gospatricksson
earl
of
whatever
he
can
lay
hold
of
for
the
current
are
you
in
earnest
alftruda
laughed
one
of
her
strange
laughs
looking
straight
before
her
indeed
she
had
never
looked
hereward
in
the
face
during
the
whole
ride
what
are
those
open
holes
graves
they
are
barnack
which
alfgar
my
brother
gave
to
so
that
is
pity
i
thought
they
had
been
graves
and
then
you
might
have
covered
me
up
in
one
of
them
and
left
me
to
sleep
in
what
can
i
do
for
you
alftruda
my
old
alftruda
whom
i
saved
from
the
bear
if
she
had
foreseen
the
second
monster
into
whose
jaws
she
was
to
fall
she
would
have
prayed
you
to
hold
that
terrible
hand
of
yours
which
never
since
men
say
has
struck
without
victory
and
renown
you
won
your
first
honor
for
my
sake
but
who
am
i
now
that
you
should
turn
out
of
your
glorious
path
for
me
i
will
do
anything
anything
but
why
miscall
this
noble
prince
a
monster
if
he
were
fairer
than
john
more
wise
than
solomon
and
more
valiant
than
king
william
he
is
to
me
a
monster
for
i
loathe
him
and
i
know
not
why
but
do
your
duty
as
a
knight
sir
convey
the
lawful
wife
to
her
lawful
what
cares
an
outlaw
for
law
in
a
land
where
law
is
dead
and
gone
i
will
do
what
i
what
you
like
come
with
me
to
torfrida
at
bourne
and
let
me
see
the
man
who
dares
try
to
take
you
out
of
my
alftruda
laughed
again
no
no
i
should
interrupt
the
little
doves
in
their
nest
beside
the
billing
and
cooing
might
make
me
envious
and
i
alas
who
carry
misery
with
me
round
the
land
might
make
your
torfrida
hereward
was
of
the
same
opinion
and
rode
silent
and
thoughtful
through
the
great
woods
which
are
now
the
noble
park
of
burghley
i
have
found
it
said
he
at
last
why
not
go
to
gilbert
of
ghent
at
lincoln
gilbert
why
should
he
befriend
me
he
will
do
that
or
anything
else
which
is
for
his
own
profit
all
the
world
seems
determined
to
make
profit
out
of
me
i
presume
you
would
if
i
had
come
with
you
to
i
do
not
doubt
it
this
is
a
very
wild
sea
to
swim
in
and
a
man
must
be
forgiven
if
he
catches
at
every
bit
of
selfishness
selfishness
everywhere
and
i
suppose
you
expect
to
gain
by
sending
me
to
gilbert
of
ghent
i
shall
gain
nothing
alftruda
save
the
thought
that
you
are
not
so
far
from
me
from
us
but
that
we
can
hear
of
you
send
succor
to
you
if
you
alftruda
was
silent
at
last
and
you
think
that
gilbert
would
not
be
afraid
of
angering
the
king
he
would
not
anger
the
king
gilbert
s
friendship
is
more
important
to
william
at
this
moment
than
that
of
a
dozen
gospatricks
he
holds
lincoln
town
and
with
it
the
key
of
waltheof
s
earldom
and
things
may
happen
alftruda
i
tell
you
but
if
you
tell
gilbert
may
hereward
s
curse
be
on
you
not
that
any
man
s
curse
save
yours
said
she
in
so
passionate
a
voice
that
a
thrill
of
fire
ran
through
hereward
and
he
recollected
her
scoff
at
bruges
so
he
could
not
wait
for
me
and
a
storm
of
evil
thoughts
swept
through
him
would
to
heaven
said
he
to
himself
crushing
them
gallantly
down
i
had
never
thought
of
lincoln
but
there
is
no
other
but
he
did
not
tell
alftruda
as
he
meant
to
do
that
she
might
see
him
soon
in
lincoln
castle
as
its
conqueror
and
lord
he
half
hoped
that
when
that
day
came
alftruda
might
be
somewhere
else
gilbert
can
say
he
went
on
steadying
himself
again
that
you
feared
to
go
north
on
account
of
the
disturbed
state
of
the
country
and
that
as
you
had
given
yourself
up
to
him
of
your
own
accord
he
thought
it
wisest
to
detain
you
as
a
hostage
for
dolfin
s
he
shall
say
so
i
will
make
him
say
so
be
it
now
here
we
are
at
stamford
town
and
i
must
to
my
trade
do
you
like
to
see
fighting
alftruda
the
man
s
game
the
royal
game
the
only
game
worth
a
thought
on
earth
for
you
are
like
to
see
a
little
in
the
next
ten
i
should
like
to
see
you
fight
they
tell
me
none
is
so
swift
and
terrible
in
the
battle
as
hereward
how
can
you
be
otherwise
who
slew
the
bear
when
we
were
two
happy
children
together
but
shall
i
be
safe
safe
of
course
said
hereward
who
longed
to
show
off
his
prowess
before
a
lady
who
was
there
was
no
denying
it
far
more
beautiful
than
even
torfrida
but
he
had
no
opportunity
to
show
off
his
prowess
for
as
he
galloped
in
over
stamford
bridge
abbot
thorold
galloped
out
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
town
through
casterton
and
up
the
roman
road
to
grantham
after
whom
hereward
sent
alftruda
for
he
heard
that
thorold
was
going
to
gilbert
at
lincoln
with
a
guard
of
knights
bidding
them
do
him
no
harm
but
say
that
hereward
knew
him
to
be
a
and
lover
of
fair
ladies
that
he
had
sent
him
a
right
fair
one
to
bear
him
company
to
lincoln
and
hoped
that
he
would
sing
to
her
on
the
way
the
song
of
roland
and
alftruda
who
knew
thorold
went
willingly
since
it
could
no
better
be
after
which
according
to
gaimar
hereward
tarried
three
days
at
stamford
laying
a
heavy
tribute
on
the
burgesses
for
harboring
thorold
and
his
normans
and
also
surprised
at
a
a
certain
special
enemy
of
his
and
chased
him
from
room
to
room
sword
in
hand
till
he
took
refuge
shamefully
in
an
outhouse
and
begged
his
life
and
when
his
knights
came
back
from
grantham
he
marched
to
bourne
the
next
night
says
leofric
the
deacon
or
rather
the
monk
who
paraphrased
his
saga
in
latin
prose
hereward
saw
in
his
dreams
a
man
standing
by
him
of
inestimable
beauty
old
of
years
terrible
of
countenance
in
all
the
raiment
of
his
body
more
splendid
than
all
things
which
he
had
ever
seen
or
conceived
in
his
mind
who
threatened
him
with
a
great
club
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
and
with
a
fearful
doom
that
he
should
take
back
to
his
church
all
that
had
been
carried
off
the
night
before
and
have
them
restored
utterly
each
in
its
place
if
he
wished
to
provide
for
the
salvation
of
his
soul
and
escape
on
the
spot
a
pitiable
death
but
when
awakened
he
was
seized
with
a
divine
terror
and
restored
in
the
same
hour
all
that
he
took
away
and
so
departed
going
onward
with
all
his
so
says
leofric
wishing
as
may
be
well
believed
to
advance
the
glory
of
peter
and
purge
his
master
s
name
from
the
stain
of
sacrilege
beside
the
monks
of
peterborough
no
doubt
had
no
wish
that
the
world
should
spy
out
their
nakedness
and
become
aware
that
the
golden
borough
was
stript
of
all
its
gold
nevertheless
truth
will
out
golden
borough
was
golden
borough
no
more
the
treasures
were
never
restored
they
went
to
sea
with
the
danes
and
were
scattered
far
and
wide
to
norway
to
ireland
to
denmark
all
the
spoils
says
the
chronicle
which
reached
the
latter
country
being
the
pallium
and
some
of
the
shrines
and
crosses
and
many
of
the
other
treasures
they
brought
to
one
of
the
king
s
towns
and
laid
them
up
in
the
church
but
one
night
through
their
carelessness
and
drunkenness
the
church
was
burned
with
all
that
was
therein
thus
was
the
minster
of
peterborough
burned
and
pillaged
may
almighty
god
have
pity
on
it
in
his
great
hereward
when
blamed
for
the
deed
said
always
that
he
did
it
because
of
his
allegiance
to
the
rather
than
that
the
treasures
gathered
by
danish
monks
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
french
robbers
let
them
be
given
to
their
own
danish
kinsmen
in
payment
for
their
help
to
english
liberty
but
some
of
the
treasure
at
least
he
must
have
surely
given
back
it
so
appeased
the
angry
shade
of
peter
for
on
that
night
when
marching
past
stamford
they
lost
their
way
to
whom
when
they
had
lost
their
way
a
certain
wonder
happened
and
a
miracle
if
it
can
be
said
that
such
would
be
worked
in
favor
of
men
of
blood
for
while
in
the
wild
night
and
dark
they
wandered
in
the
wood
a
huge
wolf
met
them
wagging
his
tail
like
a
tame
dog
and
went
before
them
on
a
path
and
they
taking
the
gray
beast
in
the
darkness
for
a
white
dog
cheered
on
each
other
to
follow
him
to
his
farm
which
ought
to
be
hard
by
and
in
the
silence
of
the
midnight
that
they
might
see
their
way
suddenly
candles
appeared
burning
and
clinging
to
the
lances
of
all
the
knights
not
very
bright
however
but
like
those
which
the
folk
call
wills
of
the
wisp
but
none
could
pull
them
off
or
altogether
extinguish
them
or
throw
them
from
their
hands
and
thus
they
saw
their
way
and
went
on
although
astonished
out
of
mind
with
the
wolf
leading
them
until
day
dawned
and
they
saw
to
their
great
astonishment
that
he
was
a
wolf
and
as
they
questioned
among
themselves
about
what
had
befallen
the
wolf
and
the
candles
disappeared
and
they
came
whither
they
had
been
minded
beyond
stamford
town
thanking
god
and
wondering
at
what
had
after
which
hereward
took
torfrida
and
his
child
and
all
he
had
and
took
ship
at
bardeney
and
went
for
ely
which
when
earl
warrenne
heard
he
laid
wait
for
him
seemingly
near
southery
but
got
nothing
thereby
according
to
leofric
but
the
pleasure
of
giving
and
taking
a
great
deal
of
bad
language
and
after
his
men
had
refused
reasonably
enough
to
swim
the
ouse
and
attack
hereward
an
arrow
which
hereward
se
stooping
forward
says
leofric
who
probably
saw
the
deed
shot
at
him
across
the
ouse
as
the
earl
stood
cursing
on
the
top
of
the
dike
which
arrow
flew
so
stout
and
strong
that
though
it
sprang
back
from
earl
warrenne
s
hauberk
it
knocked
him
almost
senseless
off
his
horse
and
forced
him
to
defer
his
purpose
of
avenging
sir
frederic
his
brother
after
which
hereward
threw
himself
into
ely
and
assumed
by
consent
of
all
the
command
of
the
english
who
were
therein
chapter
xxvii
how
they
held
a
great
meeting
in
the
hall
of
ely
there
sat
round
the
hall
of
ely
all
the
magnates
of
the
east
land
and
east
sea
the
abbot
on
his
high
seat
and
on
a
seat
higher
than
his
prepared
specially
sweyn
ulfsson
king
of
denmark
and
england
by
them
sat
the
bishops
egelwin
the
englishman
and
christiern
the
dane
osbiorn
the
young
earls
edwin
and
morcar
and
sweyn
s
two
sons
and
it
may
be
the
sons
of
tosti
godwinsson
and
arkill
the
great
thane
and
hereward
himself
below
them
were
knights
vikings
captains
great
holders
from
denmark
and
the
prior
and
inferior
officers
of
ely
minster
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
misty
hall
on
the
other
side
of
the
column
of
blue
vapor
which
went
trembling
up
from
the
great
heap
of
burning
turf
amidst
were
housecarles
monks
wild
men
from
the
baltic
shores
crowded
together
to
hear
what
was
done
in
that
parliament
of
their
betters
they
spoke
like
free
danes
the
betters
from
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
but
every
man
as
he
chose
they
were
in
full
thing
in
parliament
as
their
forefathers
had
been
wont
to
be
for
countless
ages
their
house
of
lords
and
their
house
of
commons
were
not
yet
defined
from
each
other
but
they
knew
the
rules
of
the
house
the
courtesies
of
debate
and
by
practice
of
free
speech
had
educated
themselves
to
bear
and
forbear
like
gentlemen
but
the
speaking
was
loud
and
earnest
often
angry
that
day
what
was
to
be
done
was
the
question
before
the
house
that
depended
said
sweyn
the
wise
and
prudent
king
on
what
could
be
done
by
the
english
to
with
and
what
that
was
has
been
already
told
when
tosti
godwinsson
ye
bishops
earls
knights
and
holders
came
to
me
five
years
ago
and
bade
me
come
and
take
the
kingdom
of
england
i
answered
him
that
i
had
not
wit
enough
to
do
the
deeds
which
canute
my
uncle
did
and
so
sat
still
in
peace
i
little
thought
that
i
should
have
lost
in
five
years
so
much
of
those
small
wits
which
i
confessed
to
that
i
should
come
after
all
to
take
england
and
find
two
kings
in
it
already
both
more
to
the
english
mind
than
me
while
william
the
frenchman
is
king
by
the
sword
and
edgar
the
englishman
king
by
proclamation
of
danish
earls
and
thanes
there
seems
no
room
here
for
sweyn
we
will
make
room
for
you
we
will
make
a
rid
road
from
here
to
winchester
shouted
the
holders
and
knights
it
is
too
late
what
say
you
hereward
leofricsson
who
go
for
a
wise
man
among
men
hereward
rose
and
spoke
gracefully
earnestly
eloquently
but
he
could
not
deny
sweyn
s
plain
words
sir
hereward
beats
about
the
bush
said
earl
osbiorn
rising
when
hereward
sat
down
none
knows
better
than
he
that
all
is
over
earl
edwin
and
earl
morcar
who
should
have
helped
us
along
watling
street
are
here
fugitives
earl
gospatrick
and
earl
waltheof
are
william
s
men
now
soon
to
raise
the
landsfolk
against
us
we
had
better
go
home
before
we
have
eaten
up
the
monks
of
then
hereward
rose
again
and
without
an
openly
insulting
word
poured
forth
his
scorn
and
rage
upon
osbiorn
why
had
he
not
kept
to
the
agreement
which
he
and
countess
gyda
had
made
with
him
through
tosti
s
sons
why
had
he
wasted
time
and
men
from
dover
to
norwich
instead
of
coming
straight
into
the
fens
and
marching
inland
to
succor
morcar
and
edwin
osbiorn
had
ruined
the
plan
and
he
only
if
it
was
ruined
and
who
was
i
to
obey
hereward
asked
osbiorn
fiercely
and
who
wert
thou
to
disobey
me
asked
sweyn
in
a
terrible
voice
hereward
is
right
we
shall
see
what
thou
sayest
to
all
this
in
full
thing
at
home
in
then
edwin
rose
entreating
peace
they
were
beaten
the
hand
of
god
was
against
them
why
should
they
struggle
any
more
or
if
they
struggled
on
why
should
they
involve
the
danes
in
their
own
ruin
then
holder
after
holder
rose
and
spoke
rough
danish
common
sense
they
had
come
hither
to
win
england
they
had
found
it
won
already
let
them
take
what
they
had
got
from
peterborough
and
go
then
winter
sprang
up
take
the
pay
and
sail
off
with
it
without
having
done
the
work
that
would
be
a
noble
tale
to
carry
home
to
your
fair
wives
in
jutland
i
shall
not
call
you
niddering
being
a
man
of
peace
as
all
whereat
all
laughed
for
the
doughty
little
man
had
not
a
hand
s
breadth
on
head
or
arm
without
its
scar
but
if
your
ladies
call
you
so
you
must
have
a
shrewd
answer
to
give
beside
knocking
them
sweyn
spoke
without
rising
the
good
knight
forgets
that
this
expedition
has
cost
denmark
already
nigh
as
much
as
harold
hardraade
s
cost
norway
it
is
hard
upon
the
danes
if
they
are
to
go
away
as
well
as
the
king
has
right
cried
hereward
let
them
take
the
plunder
of
peterborough
as
pay
for
what
they
have
done
and
what
beside
they
would
have
done
if
osbiorn
the
earl
nay
men
of
england
let
us
be
just
what
they
would
have
done
if
there
had
been
heart
and
wit
one
mind
and
one
purpose
in
england
the
danes
have
done
their
best
they
have
shown
themselves
what
they
are
our
blood
and
kin
i
know
that
some
talk
of
treason
of
bribes
let
us
have
no
more
such
vain
and
foul
suspicions
they
came
as
our
friends
and
as
our
friends
let
them
go
and
leave
us
to
fight
out
our
own
quarrel
to
the
last
drop
of
would
god
said
sweyn
thou
wouldest
go
too
thou
good
knight
here
earls
and
gentlemen
of
england
sweyn
ulfsson
offers
to
every
one
of
you
who
will
come
to
denmark
with
him
shelter
and
hospitality
till
better
times
shall
then
arose
a
mixed
cry
some
would
go
some
would
not
some
of
the
danes
took
the
proposal
cordially
some
feared
bringing
among
themselves
men
who
would
needs
want
land
of
which
there
was
none
to
give
if
the
english
came
they
must
go
up
the
baltic
and
conquer
fresh
lands
for
themselves
from
heathen
letts
and
finns
then
hereward
rose
again
and
spoke
so
nobly
and
so
well
that
all
ears
were
charmed
they
were
englishmen
and
they
would
rather
die
in
their
own
merry
england
than
conquer
new
kingdoms
in
the
cold
northeast
they
were
sworn
the
leaders
of
them
to
die
or
conquer
fighting
the
accursed
frenchman
they
were
bound
to
peter
and
to
guthlac
and
to
felix
of
ramsey
and
etheldreda
the
holy
virgin
beneath
whose
roof
they
stood
to
defend
against
frenchmen
the
saints
of
england
whom
they
despised
and
blasphemed
whose
servants
they
cast
out
thrust
into
prison
and
murdered
that
they
might
bring
in
frenchmen
from
normandy
italians
from
the
pope
of
rome
sweyn
ulfsson
spoke
as
became
him
as
a
prudent
and
a
generous
prince
the
man
who
alone
of
all
kings
defied
and
fought
the
great
hardraade
till
neither
could
fight
more
the
true
nephew
of
canute
the
king
of
kings
and
they
thanked
him
but
they
would
live
and
die
englishmen
and
every
englishman
shouted
hereward
has
right
we
will
live
and
die
fighting
the
french
and
sweyn
ulfsson
rose
again
and
said
with
a
great
oath
that
if
there
had
been
three
such
men
as
hereward
in
england
all
would
have
gone
hereward
laughed
thou
art
wrong
for
once
wise
king
we
have
failed
just
because
there
were
a
dozen
men
in
england
as
good
as
me
every
man
wanting
his
own
way
and
too
many
cooks
have
spoiled
the
broth
what
we
wanted
is
not
a
dozen
men
like
me
but
one
like
thee
to
take
us
all
by
the
back
of
the
neck
and
shake
us
soundly
and
say
do
that
or
die
and
so
after
much
talk
the
meeting
broke
up
and
when
it
broke
up
there
came
to
hereward
in
the
hall
a
man
of
his
own
age
and
put
his
hand
within
his
and
said
do
you
not
know
me
hereward
leofricsson
i
know
thee
not
good
knight
more
pity
but
by
thy
dress
and
carriage
thou
shouldest
be
a
true
viking
s
i
am
sigtryg
ranaldsson
now
king
of
waterford
and
my
wife
said
to
me
if
there
be
treachery
or
remember
this
that
hereward
leofricsson
slew
the
ogre
and
hannibal
of
gweek
likewise
and
brought
me
safe
to
thee
and
therefore
if
thou
provest
false
to
him
niddering
thou
art
and
no
niddering
is
spouse
of
thou
art
sigtryg
ranaldsson
cried
hereward
clasping
him
in
his
arms
as
the
scenes
of
his
wild
youth
rushed
across
his
mind
better
is
old
wine
than
new
and
old
friends
and
i
and
my
five
ships
are
thine
to
death
let
who
will
go
they
must
go
said
hereward
sweyn
has
right
and
osbiorn
too
the
game
is
played
out
sweep
the
chessmen
off
the
board
as
earl
ulf
did
by
canute
the
and
lost
his
life
thereby
i
shall
stand
by
and
see
thee
play
the
last
and
lose
thy
life
what
matter
i
heard
thee
sing
a
a
priest
death
a
straw
death
a
cow
death
such
death
likes
not
me
nor
likes
it
me
either
hereward
so
the
danes
sailed
away
but
sigtryg
ranaldsson
and
his
five
ships
remained
hereward
went
to
the
minster
tower
and
watched
the
ouse
flashing
with
countless
oars
northward
toward
southrey
fen
and
when
they
were
all
out
of
sight
he
went
back
and
lay
down
on
his
bed
and
wept
once
and
for
all
then
he
arose
and
went
down
into
the
hall
to
abbots
and
monks
and
earls
and
knights
and
was
the
boldest
cheeriest
wittiest
of
them
all
they
say
quoth
he
to
torfrida
that
night
that
some
men
have
gray
heads
on
green
shoulders
i
have
a
gray
heart
in
a
green
and
my
heart
is
growing
very
gray
too
said
torfrida
certainly
not
thy
and
he
played
with
her
raven
locks
that
may
come
too
and
too
for
indeed
they
were
in
very
evil
case
chapter
xxviii
how
they
fought
at
aldreth
when
william
heard
that
the
danes
were
gone
he
marched
on
ely
as
on
an
easy
prey
ivo
taillebois
came
with
him
hungry
after
those
spalding
lands
the
rents
whereof
hereward
had
been
taking
for
his
men
for
now
twelve
months
william
de
warrenne
was
there
vowed
to
revenge
the
death
of
sir
frederic
his
brother
ralph
guader
was
there
flushed
with
his
success
at
norwich
and
with
them
all
the
frenchmen
of
the
east
who
had
been
either
expelled
from
their
lands
or
were
in
fear
of
expulsion
with
them
too
was
a
great
army
of
mercenaries
ruffians
from
all
france
and
flanders
hired
to
fight
for
a
certain
term
on
the
chance
of
plunder
or
of
fiefs
in
land
their
brains
were
all
aflame
with
the
tales
of
inestimable
riches
hidden
in
ely
there
were
there
the
jewels
of
all
the
monasteries
round
there
were
the
treasures
of
all
the
fugitive
english
nobles
there
were
there
what
was
there
not
and
they
grumbled
when
william
halted
them
and
hutted
them
at
cambridge
and
began
to
feel
cautiously
the
strength
of
the
place
which
must
be
strong
or
hereward
and
the
english
would
not
have
made
it
their
camp
of
refuge
perhaps
he
rode
up
to
madingley
windmill
and
saw
fifteen
miles
away
clear
against
the
sky
the
long
line
of
what
seemed
naught
but
a
low
upland
park
with
the
minster
tower
among
the
trees
and
between
him
and
them
a
rich
champaign
of
grass
over
which
it
was
easy
enough
to
march
all
the
armies
of
europe
and
thought
ely
an
easy
place
to
take
but
men
told
him
that
between
him
and
those
trees
lay
a
black
abyss
of
mud
and
peat
and
reeds
haddenham
fen
and
smithy
fen
with
the
deep
sullen
west
water
or
of
the
ouse
winding
through
them
the
old
roman
road
was
sunk
and
gone
long
since
under
the
bog
whether
by
english
neglect
or
whether
as
some
think
by
actual
and
bodily
sinking
of
the
whole
land
the
narrowest
space
between
dry
land
and
dry
land
was
a
full
and
how
to
cross
that
no
man
knew
what
were
the
approaches
on
the
west
there
were
none
beyond
earith
where
now
run
the
great
washes
of
the
bedford
level
was
a
howling
wilderness
of
meres
seas
and
floating
through
which
only
the
wandered
with
and
log
canoe
what
in
the
east
the
dry
land
neared
the
island
on
that
side
and
it
may
be
that
william
rowed
round
by
burwell
to
fordham
and
soham
and
thought
of
attempting
the
island
by
way
of
barraway
and
saw
beneath
him
a
labyrinth
of
islands
meres
fens
with
the
ouse
now
increased
by
the
volume
of
the
cam
lying
deep
and
broad
between
barraway
and
and
saw
too
that
a
disaster
in
that
labyrinth
might
be
a
destruction
so
he
determined
on
the
near
and
straight
path
through
long
stratton
and
willingham
down
the
old
from
willingham
ploughed
field
every
village
there
and
in
the
isle
likewise
had
and
has
still
its
field
or
ancient
clearing
of
ploughed
land
and
then
to
try
that
terrible
with
the
courage
and
wit
of
a
general
to
whom
human
lives
were
as
those
of
the
gnats
under
the
hedge
so
all
his
host
camped
themselves
in
willingham
field
by
the
old
earthwork
which
men
now
call
belsar
s
hills
and
down
the
poured
countless
men
bearing
timber
and
fagots
cut
from
all
the
hills
that
they
might
bridge
the
black
they
made
a
narrow
firm
path
through
the
reeds
and
down
to
the
brink
of
the
ouse
if
brink
it
could
be
called
where
the
water
rising
and
falling
a
foot
or
two
each
tide
covered
the
floating
peat
for
many
yards
before
it
sunk
into
a
brown
depth
of
bottomless
slime
they
would
make
a
bottom
for
themselves
by
driving
piles
the
piles
would
not
hold
and
they
began
to
make
a
floating
bridge
with
long
beams
says
leofric
and
to
float
them
soon
they
made
a
floating
sow
and
thrust
it
on
before
them
as
they
worked
across
the
stream
for
they
were
getting
under
shot
from
the
island
meanwhile
the
besieged
had
not
been
idle
they
had
thrown
up
says
leofric
a
turf
rampart
on
the
island
shore
and
et
propugnacula
doubtless
overhanging
hoardings
or
scaffolds
through
the
floor
of
which
they
could
shower
down
missiles
and
so
they
awaited
the
attack
contenting
themselves
with
gliding
in
and
out
of
the
reeds
in
their
canoes
and
annoying
the
builders
with
arrows
and
bolts
at
last
the
bridge
was
finished
and
the
sow
safe
across
the
west
water
and
thrust
in
as
far
as
it
would
float
among
the
reeds
on
the
high
tide
they
in
the
fort
could
touch
it
with
a
pole
the
english
would
have
destroyed
it
if
they
could
but
hereward
bade
them
leave
it
alone
he
had
watched
all
their
work
and
made
up
his
mind
to
the
event
the
rats
have
set
a
trap
for
themselves
he
said
to
his
men
and
we
shall
be
fools
to
break
it
up
till
the
rats
are
safe
so
there
the
huge
sow
lay
black
and
silent
showing
nothing
to
the
enemy
but
a
side
of
strong
plank
covered
with
hide
to
prevent
its
being
burned
it
lay
there
for
three
hours
and
hereward
let
it
lie
he
had
never
been
so
cheerful
so
confident
play
the
man
this
day
every
one
of
you
and
ere
nightfall
you
will
have
taught
the
norman
once
more
the
lesson
of
york
he
seems
to
have
forgotten
that
it
is
me
to
remind
him
of
and
he
looked
to
his
bow
and
to
his
arrows
and
prepared
to
play
the
man
himself
as
was
the
fashion
in
those
old
days
when
a
general
proved
his
worth
by
hitting
harder
and
more
surely
than
any
of
his
men
at
last
the
army
was
in
motion
and
willingham
field
opposite
was
like
a
crawling
ants
nest
brigade
after
brigade
moved
down
to
the
reed
beds
and
the
assault
began
and
now
advanced
along
the
causeway
and
along
the
bridge
a
dark
column
of
men
surmounted
by
glittering
steel
knights
in
complete
mail
footmen
in
leather
coats
and
quilted
jerkins
at
first
orderly
enough
each
under
the
banner
of
his
lord
but
more
and
more
mingled
and
crowded
as
they
hurried
forward
each
eager
for
his
selfish
share
of
the
inestimable
treasures
of
ely
they
pushed
along
the
bridge
the
mass
became
more
and
more
crowded
men
stumbled
over
each
other
and
fell
off
into
the
mire
and
the
water
calling
vainly
for
help
while
their
comrades
hurried
on
unheeding
in
the
mad
thirst
for
spoil
on
they
came
in
thousands
and
fresh
thousands
streamed
out
of
the
fields
as
if
the
whole
army
intended
to
pour
itself
into
the
isle
at
once
they
are
numberless
said
torfrida
in
a
serious
and
astonished
voice
as
she
stood
by
hereward
s
side
would
they
were
said
hereward
let
them
come
on
thick
and
threefold
the
more
their
numbers
the
fatter
will
the
fish
below
be
before
morning
look
there
already
and
already
the
bridge
was
swaying
and
sinking
beneath
their
weight
the
men
in
places
were
ankle
deep
in
water
they
rushed
on
all
the
more
eagerly
and
filled
the
sow
and
swarmed
up
to
its
roof
then
what
with
its
own
weight
what
with
the
weight
of
the
laden
bridge
which
dragged
upon
it
from
behind
the
huge
sow
began
to
tilt
backwards
and
slide
down
the
slimy
bank
the
men
on
the
top
tried
vainly
to
keep
their
footing
to
hurl
grapnels
into
the
rampart
to
shoot
off
their
quarrels
and
arrows
you
must
be
quick
frenchmen
shouted
hereward
in
derision
if
you
mean
to
come
on
board
the
normans
knew
that
well
and
as
hereward
spoke
two
panels
in
the
front
of
the
sow
creaked
on
their
hinges
and
dropped
landward
forming
two
over
which
reeled
to
the
attack
a
close
body
of
knights
mingled
with
soldiers
bearing
scaling
ladders
they
recoiled
between
the
ends
of
the
and
the
foot
of
the
rampart
was
some
two
fathoms
depth
of
black
ooze
the
catastrophe
which
hereward
had
foreseen
was
come
and
a
shout
of
derision
arose
from
the
unseen
defenders
above
come
on
leap
it
like
men
send
back
for
your
horses
knights
and
ride
them
at
it
like
bold
huntsmen
the
front
rank
could
not
but
rush
on
for
the
pressure
behind
forced
them
forward
whether
they
would
or
not
in
a
moment
they
were
wallowing
waist
deep
trampled
on
and
disappearing
under
their
struggling
comrades
who
disappeared
in
their
turn
look
torfrida
if
they
plant
their
scaling
ladders
it
will
be
on
a
foundation
of
their
comrades
torfrida
gave
one
glance
through
the
openings
of
the
hoarding
upon
the
writhing
mass
below
and
turned
away
in
horror
the
men
were
not
so
merciful
down
between
the
rained
stones
javelins
arrows
increasing
the
agony
and
death
the
scaling
ladders
would
not
stand
in
the
mire
if
they
had
stood
a
moment
the
struggles
of
the
dying
would
have
thrown
them
down
and
still
fresh
victims
pressed
on
from
behind
shouting
dex
aie
on
to
the
gold
of
ely
and
still
the
sow
under
the
weight
slipped
further
and
further
back
into
the
stream
and
the
foul
gulf
widened
between
besiegers
and
besieged
at
last
one
scaling
ladder
was
planted
upon
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
hooked
firmly
on
the
gunwale
of
the
hoarding
ere
it
could
be
hurled
off
again
by
the
english
it
was
so
crowded
with
men
that
even
hereward
s
strength
was
insufficient
to
lift
it
off
he
stood
at
the
top
ready
to
hew
down
the
first
comer
and
he
hewed
him
down
but
the
normans
were
not
to
be
daunted
man
after
man
dropped
dead
from
the
ladder
top
man
after
man
took
his
place
sometimes
two
at
a
time
sometimes
scrambling
over
each
other
s
backs
the
english
even
in
the
insolence
of
victory
cheered
them
with
honest
admiration
you
are
fellows
worth
fighting
you
french
so
we
are
shouted
a
knight
the
first
and
last
who
crossed
that
parapet
for
thrusting
hereward
back
with
a
blow
of
his
he
staggered
past
him
over
the
hoarding
and
fell
on
his
knees
a
dozen
men
were
upon
him
but
he
was
up
again
and
shouting
to
me
a
dade
a
dade
but
no
man
answered
yield
quoth
hereward
sir
dade
answered
by
a
blow
on
hereward
s
helmet
which
felled
the
chief
to
his
knees
and
broke
the
sword
into
twenty
splinters
well
hit
said
hereward
as
he
rose
don
t
touch
him
men
this
is
my
quarrel
now
yield
sir
you
have
done
enough
for
your
honor
it
is
madness
to
throw
away
your
the
knight
looked
round
on
the
fierce
ring
of
faces
in
the
midst
of
which
he
stood
alone
to
none
but
hereward
am
ah
said
the
knight
had
i
but
hit
a
little
harder
you
would
have
broke
your
sword
into
more
splinters
my
armor
is
enchanted
so
yield
like
a
reasonable
and
valiant
what
care
i
said
the
knight
stepping
on
to
the
earthwork
and
sitting
down
quietly
i
vowed
to
mary
and
king
william
that
into
ely
i
would
get
this
day
and
in
ely
i
am
so
i
have
done
my
and
now
you
shall
taste
as
such
a
gallant
knight
deserves
the
hospitality
of
it
was
torfrida
who
spoke
my
husband
s
prisoners
are
mine
and
i
when
i
find
them
such
as
you
are
have
no
lighter
chains
for
them
than
that
which
a
lady
s
bower
can
sir
dade
was
going
to
make
an
equally
courteous
answer
when
over
and
above
the
shouts
and
curses
of
the
combatants
rose
a
yell
so
keen
so
dreadful
as
made
all
hurry
forward
to
the
rampart
that
which
hereward
had
foreseen
was
come
at
last
the
bridge
strained
more
and
more
by
its
living
burden
and
by
the
falling
tide
had
parted
not
at
the
ely
end
where
the
sliding
of
the
sow
took
off
the
pressure
but
at
the
end
nearest
the
camp
one
sideway
roll
it
gave
and
then
turning
over
engulfed
in
that
foul
stream
the
flower
of
norman
chivalry
leaving
a
line
a
full
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
of
wretches
drowning
in
the
dark
water
or
more
hideous
still
in
the
bottomless
slime
of
peat
and
mud
thousands
are
said
to
have
perished
their
armor
and
weapons
were
found
at
times
by
delvers
and
dikers
for
centuries
after
are
found
at
times
unto
this
day
beneath
the
rich
drained
cornfields
which
now
fill
up
that
black
or
in
the
bed
of
the
narrow
brook
to
which
the
westwater
robbed
of
its
streams
by
the
bedford
level
has
dwindled
down
at
last
william
they
say
struck
his
tents
and
departed
forthwith
groaning
from
deep
grief
of
heart
and
so
ended
the
first
battle
of
aldreth
chapter
xxix
how
sir
dade
brought
news
from
ely
a
month
after
the
fight
there
came
into
the
camp
at
cambridge
riding
on
a
good
horse
himself
fat
and
none
other
than
sir
dade
boisterously
he
was
received
as
one
alive
from
the
dead
and
questioned
as
to
his
adventures
and
sufferings
adventures
i
have
had
and
strange
ones
but
for
sufferings
instead
of
i
bring
back
as
you
see
a
new
suit
of
clothes
instead
of
an
empty
and
starved
stomach
a
surfeit
from
good
victuals
and
good
liquor
and
whereas
i
went
into
ely
on
foot
i
came
out
on
a
fast
so
into
william
s
tent
he
went
and
there
he
told
his
tale
so
dade
my
friend
quoth
the
duke
in
high
good
humor
for
he
loved
dade
you
seem
to
have
been
in
good
company
never
in
better
sire
save
in
your
presence
of
the
earls
and
knights
in
ely
all
i
can
say
is
god
s
pity
that
they
are
rebels
for
more
gallant
and
courteous
knights
or
more
perfect
warriors
never
saw
i
neither
in
normandy
nor
at
constantinople
among
the
varangers
eh
and
what
are
the
names
of
these
gallants
for
you
have
used
your
eyes
and
ears
of
course
edwin
and
morcar
the
earls
two
fine
young
i
know
it
go
on
and
a
shade
passed
over
william
s
brow
as
he
thought
of
his
own
falsehood
and
his
fair
constance
weeping
in
vain
for
the
fair

had
promised

her
siward

as
they
call
him

those
are

there
too
and
besides
them
all
and
above
them
all
hereward
the
like
of
that
knight
i
may
have
seen
his
better
saw
i
sir
fool
said
earl
warrenne
who
had
not
yet
small
blame
to
him
forgotten
his
brother
s
death
they
have
soused
thy
brains
with
their
muddy
ale
till
thou
knowest
not
friend
from
foe
what
hast
thou
to
come
hither
praising
up
to
the
king
s
majesty
such
an
outlawed
villain
as
that
with
whom
no
honest
knight
would
keep
company
if
you
earl
warrenne
ever
found
dade
drunk
or
lying
it
is
more
than
the
king
here
has
let
him
speak
earl
said
william
i
have
not
an
honester
man
in
my
camp
and
he
speaks
for
my
information
not
for
then
for
yours
will
i
speak
sir
king
these
men
treated
me
knightly
and
sent
me
away
without
they
had
an
eye
to
their
own
profit
it
seems
grumbled
the
earl
but
force
me
they
did
to
swear
on
the
holy
gospels
that
i
should
tell
your
majesty
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
and
i
keep
my
oath
quoth
dade
go
on
then
without
fear
or
favor
are
there
any
other
men
of
note
in
the
island
are
they
in
want
of
provisions
look
how
they
have
fattened
what
do
they
complain
of
i
will
tell
you
sir
king
the
monks
like
many
more
took
fright
at
the
coming
over
of
our
french
men
of
god
to
set
right
all
their
filthy
barbarous
ways
and
that
is
why
they
threw
ely
open
to
the
i
will
be
even
with
the
sots
quoth
william
however
they
think
that
danger
blown
over
just
now
for
they
have
a
story
among
them
which
as
my
lord
the
king
never
heard
before
he
may
as
well
hear
eh
how
your
majesty
should
have
sent
across
the
sea
a
whole
shipload
of
french
that
have
i
and
will
more
till
i
reduce
these
swine
into
something
like
obedience
to
his
holiness
of
ah
but
your
majesty
has
not
heard
how
one
bruman
a
valiant
english
knight
was
sailing
on
the
sea
and
caught
those
monks
whereon
he
tied
a
great
sack
to
the
ship
s
head
and
cut
the
bottom
out
and
made
every
one
of
those
monks
get
into
that
sack
and
so
fall
through
into
the
sea
whereby
he
rid
the
monks
of
ely
of
their
pish
why
tell
me
such
an
fable
knight
because
the
monks
believe
that
fable
and
are
and
the
blood
of
martyrs
is
the
seed
of
the
church
said
william
s
chaplain
a
pupil
and
friend
of
lanfranc
and
if
these
men
of
belial
drowned
every
man
of
god
in
normandy
ten
would
spring
up
in
their
places
to
convert
this
benighted
and
besotted
land
of
simonites
and
balaamites
whose
priests
like
the
brutes
which
perish
scruple
not
to
defile
themselves
and
the
service
of
the
altar
with
things
which
they
impudently
call
their
we
know
that
good
chaplain
quoth
william
impatiently
he
had
enough
of
that
language
from
lanfranc
himself
and
moreover
was
thinking
more
of
the
isle
of
ely
than
of
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
well
sir
dade
so
they
have
got
together
all
their
kin
for
among
these
monks
every
one
is
kin
to
a
thane
or
knight
or
even
an
earl
and
there
they
are
brother
by
brother
cousin
by
cousin
knee
to
knee
and
back
to
back
like
a
pack
of
wolves
and
that
in
a
hold
which
you
will
not
enter
yet
does
my
friend
dade
doubt
his
duke
s
skill
at
last
sir
duke
sir
king
i
mean
now
for
king
you
are
and
deserve
to
be
i
know
what
you
can
do
i
remember
how
we
took
england
at
one
blow
on
senlac
field
but
see
you
here
sir
king
how
will
you
take
an
island
where
four
kings
such
as
you
if
the
world
would
hold
four
such
at
once
could
not
stop
one
churl
from
ploughing
the
land
or
one
from
setting
and
what
if
i
can
not
stop
the
do
they
expect
to
lime
frenchmen
as
easily
as
sparrows
sparrows
it
is
not
sparrows
that
i
have
been
fattening
on
this
last
month
i
tell
you
sire
i
have
seen
alone
in
that
island
enough
to
feed
them
all
the
year
round
i
was
there
in
the
and
saw
them
take
one
day
one
hundred
one
two
hundred
and
once
as
i
am
a
belted
knight
a
thousand
duck
out
of
one
single
mere
there
is
a
wood
there
with
herons
sprawling
about
the
i
did
not
think
there
were
so
many
in
the
world
and
fish
for
lent
and
fridays
in
every
puddle
and
leat
pike
and
perch
tench
and
eels
on
every
s
table
while
the
knights
think
scorn
of
anything
worse
than
smelts
and
splendeur
dex
quoth
william
who
did
not
dislike
a
good
dinner
i
must
keep
lent
in
ely
before
i
then
you
had
best
make
peace
with
the
knights
my
but
have
they
the
isle
is
half
of
it
a
garden
richer
land
they
say
is
none
in
these
realms
and
i
believe
it
but
besides
that
there
is
a
there
with
a
thousand
head
in
it
red
and
fallow
and
plenty
of
swine
in
woods
and
sheep
and
cattle
and
if
they
fail
there
are
plenty
more
to
be
got
they
know
they
know
where
do
you
sir
knight
asked
william
keenly
out
of
every
little
island
in
their
fens
for
forty
miles
on
end
there
are
the
herds
fattening
themselves
on
the
richest
pastures
in
the
land
and
no
man
needing
to
herd
them
for
they
are
all
safe
among
dikes
and
i
will
make
my
boats
sweep
their
fens
clear
of
every
head
take
care
my
lord
king
lest
never
a
boat
come
back
from
that
errand
with
their
narrow
punts
cut
out
of
a
single
log
and
their
wherewith
they
fly
over
dikes
of
thirty
feet
in
width
they
can
ambuscade
in
those
and
kill
whom
they
will
and
then
flee
away
through
the
marsh
like
so
many
and
if
not
one
trick
have
they
left
which
they
never
try
save
when
driven
into
a
corner
but
from
that
may
all
saints
save
us
what
then
firing
the
and
destroying
their
own
cover
true
therefore
they
will
only
do
it
in
then
to
despair
will
i
drive
them
and
try
their
worst
so
these
monks
are
as
stout
rebels
as
the
earls
i
only
say
what
i
saw
at
the
there
dined
each
day
maybe
some
fifty
belted
knights
with
every
one
a
monk
next
to
him
and
at
the
high
table
the
abbot
and
the
three
earls
and
hereward
and
his
lady
and
thurkill
barn
and
behind
each
knight
and
each
monk
likewise
hung
against
the
wall
lance
and
shield
helmet
and
hauberk
sword
and
to
monk
as
well
as
knight
as
i
am
a
knight
myself
and
were
as
well
used
too
for
aught
i
saw
the
monks
took
turns
with
the
knights
as
sentries
and
as
foragers
too
and
the
knights
themselves
told
me
openly
the
monks
were
as
good
men
as
as
wicked
you
mean
groaned
the
chaplain
o
accursed
and
bloodthirsty
race
why
does
not
the
earth
open
and
swallow
you
with
korah
dathan
and
abiram
they
would
not
mind
quoth
dade
they
are
born
and
bred
in
the
bottomless
pit
already
they
would
jump
over
or
flounder
out
as
they
do
to
their
own
bogs
every
you
speak
irreverently
my
friend
quoth
william
ask
those
who
are
in
camp
and
not
me
as
for
whither
they
went
or
how
the
english
were
not
likely
to
tell
me
all
i
know
is
that
i
saw
fresh
cattle
come
every
few
days
and
fresh
farms
burnt
too
on
the
norfolk
side
there
were
farms
burning
last
night
only
between
here
and
cambridge
ask
your
sentinels
on
the
how
that
came
about
i
can
answer
that
quoth
a
voice
from
the
other
end
of
the
tent
i
was
on
the
last
night
close
down
to
the
fen
worse
luck
and
shame
for
answer
then
quoth
william
with
one
of
his
horrible
oaths
glad
to
have
some
one
on
whom
he
could
turn
his
rage
and
disappointment
there
came
seven
men
in
a
boat
up
from
ely
yestereven
and
five
of
them
were
monks
they
came
up
from
burwell
fen
and
plundered
and
burnt
burwell
and
where
were
all
you
mighty
men
of
war
ten
of
us
ran
down
to
stop
them
with
richard
earl
osbern
s
nephew
at
their
head
the
villains
got
to
the
top
of
the
and
made
a
stand
and
before
we
could
get
to
them
thy
men
had
run
of
they
were
every
one
dead
or
wounded
save
richard
and
he
was
fighting
with
an
englishman
while
the
other
six
stood
around
and
looked
then
they
fought
fairly
said
william
as
fairly
to
do
them
justice
as
if
they
had
been
frenchmen
and
not
english
churls
as
we
came
down
along
the
dike
a
little
man
of
them
steps
between
the
two
and
strikes
down
their
swords
as
if
they
had
been
two
reeds
come
cries
he
enough
of
this
you
are
two
well
matched
and
you
can
fight
out
this
any
other
day
and
away
he
and
his
men
go
down
the
to
the
leaving
richard
safe
wounded
a
little
but
safe
and
then
we
followed
them
to
the
boat
as
hard
as
we
could
killed
one
with
a
javelin
and
caught
knightly
done
and
william
swore
an
awful
oath
and
worthy
of
valiant
frenchmen
these
english
set
you
the
example
of
chivalry
by
letting
your
comrade
fight
his
own
battle
fairly
instead
of
setting
on
him
all
together
and
you
repay
them
by
hunting
them
down
with
darts
because
you
dare
not
go
within
sword
of
better
men
than
yourselves
go
i
am
ashamed
of
you
no
stay
where
is
your
prisoner
for
splendeur
dex
i
will
send
him
back
safe
and
sound
in
return
for
dade
to
tell
the
knights
of
ely
that
if
they
know
so
well
the
courtesies
of
war
william
of
rouen
does
the
prisoner
sire
quoth
the
knight
trembling
is
is
you
have
not
murdered
him
heaven
forbid
but
he
broke
his
bonds
and
escaped
gnawed
them
through
sire
as
we
suppose
and
escaped
through
the
mire
in
the
dark
after
the
fashion
of
these
accursed
frogs
of
but
did
he
tell
you
naught
ere
he
bade
you
good
morning
he
told
as
the
names
of
all
the
seven
he
that
beat
down
the
swords
was
hereward
i
thought
as
much
when
shall
i
have
that
fellow
at
my
side
he
that
fought
richard
was
one
i
have
heard
of
he
that
we
slew

more

we
took

azer

monk
of
nicole

rest
were

the

monk
of

and
if
i
catch
them

will
make
an

deprecating
tone
chapter

how
hereward
played
the
potter
and
how
he
cheated
the
king
they
of
ely
were
now
much
straitened
being
shut
in
both
by
land
and
water
and
what
was
to
be
done
either
by
themselves
or
by
the
king
they
knew
not
would
william
simply
starve
them
or
at
least
inflict
on
them
so
perpetual
a
lent
for
of
fish
there
could
be
no
lack
even
if
they
ate
or
drove
away
all
the
fowl
as
would
tame
down
their
proud
spirits
which
a
diet
of
fish
and
vegetables
from
some
ludicrous
theory
of
monastic
physicians
was
supposed
to
do
footnote
the
cornish

stoutest
tallest
and
most
prolific
race
of
the
south
live
on
hardly
anything
else
but
fish

was
he
gathering
vast
armies
from

knew
not
whence
to
try
once
and
for
all
another
assault
on
the
island
it
might
be
from
several
points
at

they
must
send
out
a
spy
and
find
out
news
from
the
outer
world
if

were

who
would
go

asked
the
bishop

the
earls
in

in
the

s
lodging
torfrida
was
among

she
was
always
among

now
she
was
their
their
vala
their
wise
woman
whose
counsels
all
received
as
more
than
human
i
will
go
said
she
rising
up
like
a
goddess
on
olympus
i
will
cut
off
my
hair
and
put
on
boy
s
clothes
and
smirch
myself
brown
with
walnut
leaves
and
i
will
go
i
can
talk
their
french
tongue
i
know
their
french
ways
and
as
for
a
story
to
cover
my
journey
and
my
doings
trust
a
woman
s
wit
to
invent
they
looked
at
her
with
delight
in
her
courage
but
with
doubt
if
william
s
french
grooms
got
hold
of
you
torfrida
it
would
not
be
a
little
walnut
brown
which
would
hide
you
said
hereward
it
is
like
you
to
offer
worthy
of
you
who
have
no
that
she
has
not
quoth
churchmen
and
soldiers
alike
but
to
send
you
would
be
to
send
hereward

wrong
half
the
right
half
of
hereward
is
going
and
that
is
uncle
uncle
said
the
young
earls
send

geri
leofwin
prat
any
of
your
fellows
but
not
yourself
if
we
lose
you
we
lose
our
head
and
our
and
all
prayed
hereward
to
let
any
man
go
rather
than
himself
i
am
going
lords
and
knights
and
what
hereward
says
he
does
it
is
one
day
to
brandon
it
may
be
two
days
back
for
if
i
miscarry
as
i
most
likely
shall
i
must
come
home
round
about
on
the
fourth
day
you
shall
hear
of
me
or
from
me
come
with
me
and
he
strode
out
he
cropped
his
golden
locks
he
cropped
his
golden
beard
and
torfrida
cried
as
she
cropped
them
half
with
fear
for
him
half
for
sorrow
over
his
shorn
glories
i
am
no
samson
my
lady
my
strength
lieth
not
in
my
locks
now
for
some
rascal
s
clothes
as
little
dirty
as
you
can
get
me
for
fear
of
and
hereward
put
on
filthy
garments
and
taking
mare
swallow
with
him
got
into
a
barge
and
went
across
the
river
to
soham
he
could
not
go
down
the
great
ouse
and
up
the
little
ouse
which
was
his
easiest
way
for
the
french
held
all
the
river
below
the
isle
and
beside
to
have
come
straight
from
ely
might
cause
suspicion
so
he
went
down
to
fordham
and
crossed
the
lark
at
mildenhall
and
just
before
he
got
to
mildenhall
he
met
a
potter
carrying
pots
upon
a
pony
halt
my
stout
fellow
quoth
he
and
put
thy
pots
on
my
mare
s
the
man
who
wants
them
must
fight
for
them
quoth
that
stout
churl
raising
a
heavy
staff
then
here
is
he
that
will
quoth
hereward
and
jumping
off
his
mare
he
twisted
the
staff
out
of
the
potter
s
hands
and
knocked
him
down
therewith
that
will
teach
thee
to
know
an
englishman
when
thou
seest
i
have
met
my
master
quoth
the
churl
rubbing
his
head
but
dog
does
not
eat
dog
and
it
is
hard
to
be
robbed
by
an
englishman
after
being
robbed
a
dozen
times
by
the
i
will
not
rob
thee
there
is
a
silver
penny
for
thy
pots
and
thy
coat
for
that
i
must
have
likewise
and
if
thou
tellest
to
mortal
man
aught
about
this
i
will
find
those
who
will
cut
thee
to
ribbons
and
if
not
then
turn
thy
horse
s
head
and
ride
back
to
ely
if
thou
canst
cross
the
water
and
say
what
has
befallen
thee
and
thou
wilt
find
there
an
abbot
who
will
give
thee
another
penny
for
thy
so
hereward
took
the
pots
and
the
potter
s
coat
and
went
on
through
mildenhall
crying
saith
the
chronicler
after
the
manner
of
potters
in
the
english
tongue
pots
pots
good
pots
and
pans
but
when
he
got
through
mildenhall
and
well
into
the
he
gave
mare
swallow
a
kick
and
went
over
the
heath
so
fast
northward
that
his
pots
danced
such
a
dance
as
broke
half
of
them
before
he
got
to
brandon
never
mind
quoth
he
they
will
think
that
i
have
sold
and
when
he
neared
brandon
he
pulled
up
sorted
his
pots
kept
the
whole
ones
threw
the
sherds
at
the
rabbits
and
walked
on
into
brandon
solemnly
leading
the
mare
and
crying
pots
so
semper
marcida
et
deformis
aspectu
lean
and
was
that
famous
mare
says
the
chronicler
that
no
one
would
suspect
her
splendid
powers
or
take
her
for
anything
but
a
potter
s
nag
when
she
was
caparisoned
in
proper
character
hereward
felt
thoroughly
at
home
in
his
part
as
able
to
play
the
englishman
which
he
was
by
rearing
as
the
frenchman
which
he
was
by
education
he
was
full
of
heart
and
happy
he
enjoyed
the
keen
fresh
air
of
the
warrens
he
enjoyed
the
ramble
out
of
the
isle
in
which
he
had
been
cooped
up
so
long
he
enjoyed
the
fun
of
the
thing
disguise
stratagem
adventure
danger
and
so
did
the
english
who
adored
him
none
of
hereward
s
deeds
is
told
so
carefully
and
lovingly
and
none
doubt
it
not
was
so
often
sung
in
after
years
by
hearths
or
in
the
outlaws
lodge
as
this
robin
hood
himself
may
have
trolled
out
many
a
time
in
doggrel
strain
how
hereward
played
the
potter
and
he
came
to
brandon
to
the
king
s
court
probably
weeting
hall
or
castle
from
which
william
could
command
the
streams
of
wissey
and
little
ouse
with
all
their
fens
and
cast
about
for
a
night
s
lodging
for
it
was
dark
outside
the
town
was
a
wretched
cabin
of
mud
and
turf
such
a
one
as
irish
folk
live
in
to
this
day
and
hereward
said
to
himself
this
is
bad
enough
to
be
good
enough
for
so
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
knocked
till
it
was
opened
and
a
hideous
old
crone
put
out
her
head
who
wants
to
see
me
at
this
time
of
night
any
one
would
who
had
heard
how
beautiful
you
are
do
you
want
any
pots
pots
what
have
i
to
do
with
pots
thou
saucy
fellow
i
thought
it
was
some
one
wanting
a
and
she
shut
the
door
a
charm
thought
hereward
maybe
she
can
tell
me
news
if
she
be
a
witch
they
are
shrewd
souls
these
witches
and
know
more
than
they
tell
but
if
i
can
get
any
news
i
care
not
if
satan
brings
it
in
so
he
knocked
again
till
the
old
woman
looked
out
once
more
and
bade
him
angrily
be
off
but
i
am
belated
here
good
dame
and
afraid
of
the
french
and
i
will
give
thee
the
best
bit
of
clay
on
my
mare
s
back
pot
pan
pansion
crock
jug
or
what
thou
wilt
for
a
night
s
have
you
any
little
jars
jars
no
longer
than
my
hand
asked
she
for
she
used
them
in
her
trade
and
had
broken
one
of
late
but
to
pay
for
one
she
had
neither
money
nor
mind
so
she
agreed
to
let
hereward
sleep
there
for
the
value
of
two
jars
but
what
of
that
ugly
brute
of
a
horse
of
thine
she
will
do
well
enough
in
the
then
thou
must
pay
with
a
ugh
groaned
hereward
thou
drivest
a
hard
bargain
for
an
englishwoman
with
a
poor
how
knowest
thou
that
i
am
english
so
much
the
better
if
thou
art
not
thought
hereward
and
bargained
with
her
for
a
pannikin
against
a
lodging
for
the
horse
in
the
and
a
bottle
of
bad
hay
then
he
went
in
bringing
his
panniers
with
him
with
ostentatious
care
thou
canst
sleep
there
on
the
rushes
i
have
naught
to
give
thee
to
naught
needs
naught
said
hereward
threw
himself
down
on
a
bundle
of
rush
and
in
a
few
minutes
snored
loudly
but
he
was
never
less
asleep
he
looked
round
the
whole
cabin
and
he
listened
to
every
word
the
devil
as
usual
was
a
bad
paymaster
for
the
witch
s
cabin
seemed
only
somewhat
more
miserable
than
that
of
other
old
women
the
floor
was
mud
the
rafters
unceiled
the
stars
shone
through
the
turf
roof
the
only
hint
of
her
trade
was
a
hanging
shelf
on
which
stood
five
or
six
little
earthen
jars
and
a
few
packets
of
leaves
a
parchment
scrawled
with
characters
which
the
owner
herself
probably
did
not
understand
hung
against
the
cob
wall
and
a
human
skull
probably
used
only
to
frighten
her
patients
dangled
from
the
but
in
a
corner
stuck
against
the
wall
was
something
which
chilled
hereward
s
blood
a
little
a
dried
human
hand
which
he
knew
must
have
been
stolen
off
the
gallows
gripping
in
its
fleshless
fingers
a
candle
which
he
knew
was
made
of
human
fat
that
candle
he
knew
duly
lighted
and
carried
would
enable
the
witch
to
walk
unseen
into
any
house
on
earth
yea
through
the
court
of
king
william
himself
while
it
drowned
all
men
in
preternatural
slumber
hereward
was
very
much
frightened
he
believed
as
devoutly
in
the
powers
of
a
witch
as
did
then
and
does
now
for
aught
italian
literature
permissu
shows
the
pope
of
rome
so
he
trembled
on
his
rushes
and
wished
himself
safe
through
that
adventure
without
being
turned
into
a
hare
or
a
wolf
i
would
sooner
be
a
wolf
than
a
hare
of
course
killing
being
more
in
my
trade
than
being
killed
but
who
comes
here
and
to
the
first
old
crone
who
sat
winking
her
bleared
eyes
and
warming
her
bleared
hands
over
a
little
heap
of
peat
in
the
middle
of
the
cabin
entered
another
crone
if
possible
uglier
two
of
them
if
i
am
not
roasted
and
eaten
this
night
i
am
a
lucky
and
hereward
crossed
himself
devoutly
and
invoked
ethelfrida
of
ely
guthlac
of
crowland
felix
of
ramsey
to
whom
he
recollected
he
had
been
somewhat
remiss
but
above
all
peter
of
peterborough
whose
treasures
he
had
given
to
the
danes
and
he
argued
stoutly
with
peter
and
with
his
own
conscience
that
the
means
sanctify
the
end
and
that
he
had
done
it
all
for
the
best
if
thou
wilt
help
me
out
of
this
strait
and
the
rest
blessed
apostle
i
will
give
thee
i
will
go
to
constantinople
but
what
i
will
win
it
a
golden
table
twice
as
fine
as
those
villains
carried
off
and
one
of
the
bourne
manors
witham
or
toft
or
mainthorpe
whichever
pleases
thee
best
in
full
fee
and
a
and
a
but
while
hereward
was
casting
in
his
mind
what
gewgaw
further
might
suffice
to
appease
the
apostle
he
was
recalled
to
business
and
by
hearing
the
two
old
hags
talk
to
each
other
in
french
his
heart
leapt
for
joy
and
he
forgot
peter
utterly
well
how
have
you
sped
have
you
seen
the
king
no
but
ivo
taillebois
eh
who
the
foul
fiend
have
you
lying
there
only
an
english
brute
he
can
not
understand
us
talk
on
only
don
t
wake
the
hog
have
you
got
the
gold
never
then
there
was
a
grumbling
and
a
quarrelling
from
which
hereward
understood
that
the
gold
was
to
be
shared
between
them
but
it
is
a
bit
of
chain
to
cut
it
will
spoil
the
other
insisted
and
he
heard
them
chop
the
gold
chain
in
two
and
is
this
all
i
had
work
enough
to
get
that
he
said
no
play
no
pay
and
he
would
give
it
me
after
the
isle
was
taken
but
i
told
him
my
spirit
was
a
jewish
spirit
that
used
to
serve
solomon
the
wise
and
he
would
not
serve
me
much
less
come
over
the
sea
from
normandy
unless
he
smelt
gold
for
he
loved
it
like
any
and
what
did
you
tell
him
then
that
the
king
must
go
back
to
aldreth
again
for
only
from
thence
he
would
take
the
isle
for
and
that
was
true
enough
i
dreamt
i
saw
all
the
water
of
aldreth
full
of
wolves
clambering
over
into
the
island
on
each
other
s
that
means
that
some
of
them
will
be
let
them
drown
i
left
him
to
find
out
that
part
of
the
dream
for
himself
then
i
told
him
how
he
must
make
another
causeway
bigger
and
stronger
than
the
last
and
a
tower
on
which
i
could
stand
and
curse
the
english
and
i
promised
him
to
bring
a
storm
right
in
the
faces
of
the
english
so
that
they
could
neither
fight
nor
but
if
the
storm
does
not
come
it
will
come
i
know
the
signs
of
the
sky
who
better
and
the
weather
will
break
up
in
a
week
therefore
i
told
him
he
must
begin
his
works
at
once
before
the
rain
came
on
and
that
we
would
go
and
ask
the
spirit
of
the
well
to
tell
us
the
fortunate
day
for
that
is
my
business
said
the
other
and
my
spirit
likes
the
smell
of
gold
as
well
as
yours
little
you
would
have
got
from
me
if
you
had
not
given
me
half
the
then
the
two
rose
let
us
see
whether
the
english
hog
is
one
of
them
came
and
listened
to
hereward
s
breathing
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
chest
his
hair
stood
on
end
a
cold
sweat
came
over
him
but
he
snored
more
loudly
than
ever
the
two
old
crones
went
out
satisfied
then
hereward
rose
and
glided
after
them
they
went
down
a
meadow
to
a
little
well
which
hereward
had
marked
as
he
rode
thither
hung
round
with
bits
of
rag
and
flowers
as
similar
holy
wells
are
decorated
in
ireland
to
this
day
he
hid
behind
a
hedge
and
watched
them
stooping
over
the
well
mumbling
he
knew
not
what
of
cantrips
then
there
was
silence
and
a
tinkling
sound
as
of
water
once
twice
thrice
counted
the
witches
nine
times
he
counted
the
tinkling
sound
the
ninth
day
the
ninth
day
and
the
king
shall
take
ely
said
one
in
a
cracked
scream
rising
and
shaking
her
fist
toward
the
isle
hereward
was
more
than
to
have
put
his
dagger
the
only
weapon
which
he
had
into
the
two
old
beldames
on
the
spot
but
the
fear
of
an
outcry
kept
him
still
he
had
found
out
already
so
much
that
he
was
determined
to
find
out
more
so
he
would
go
up
to
the
court
itself
and
take
what
luck
sent
he
slipt
back
to
the
cabin
and
lay
down
again
and
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
the
two
old
crones
safe
asleep
fell
asleep
himself
and
was
so
tired
that
he
lay
till
the
sun
was
high
get
up
screamed
the
old
dame
at
last
kicking
him
or
i
shall
make
you
give
me
another
crock
for
a
double
night
s
he
paid
his
lodging
put
the
panniers
on
the
mare
and
went
on
crying
pots
when
he
came
to
the
outer
gateway
of
the
court
he
tied
up
the
mare
and
carried
the
crockery
in
on
his
own
back
boldly
the
scullions
saw
him
and
called
him
into
the
kitchen
to
see
his
crockery
without
the
least
intention
of
paying
for
what
they
took
a
man
of
rank
belonging
to
the
court
came
in
and
stared
fixedly
at
hereward
you
are
mightily
like
that
villain
hereward
man
quoth
he
anon
asked
hereward
looking
as
stupid
as
he
could
if
it
were
not
for
his
brown
face
and
short
hair
he
is
as
like
the
fellow
as
a
churl
can
be
to
a
bring
him
into
the
hall
quoth
another
and
let
us
see
if
any
man
knows
into
the
great
hall
he
was
brought
and
stared
at
by
knights
and
squires
he
bent
his
knees
rounded
his
shoulders
and
made
himself
look
as
mean
as
he
could
ivo
taillebois
and
earl
warrenne
came
down
and
had
a
look
at
him
hereward
said
ivo
i
will
warrant
that
little
slouching
cur
is
not
he
hereward
must
be
half
as
big
again
if
it
be
true
that
he
can
kill
a
man
with
one
blow
of
his
you
may
try
the
truth
of
that
for
yourself
some
day
thought
hereward
does
any
one
here
talk
english
let
us
question
the
fellow
said
earl
warrenne
hereward
hereward
who
wants
to
know
about
that
villain
answered
the
potter
as
soon
as
he
was
asked
in
english
would
to
heaven
he
were
here
and
i
could
see
some
of
you
noble
knights
and
earls
paying
him
for
me
for
i
owe
him
more
than
ever
i
shall
pay
what
does
he
mean
he
came
out
of
the
isle
ten
days
ago
nigh
on
to
evening
and
drove
off
a
cow
of
mine
and
four
sheep
which
was
all
my
living
noble
knights
save
these
and
where
is
he
since
in
the
isle
my
lords
wellnigh
starved
and
his
folk
falling
away
from
him
daily
from
hunger
and
i
doubt
if
there
be
a
hundred
sound
men
left
in
have
you
been
in
thither
then
villain
heaven
forbid
i
in
ely
i
in
the
wolf
s
den
if
i
went
in
with
naught
but
my
skin
they
would
have
it
off
me
before
i
got
out
again
if
your
lordships
would
but
come
down
and
make
an
end
of
him
once
for
all
for
he
is
a
great
tyrant
and
terrible
and
devours
us
poor
folk
like
so
many
mites
in
take
this
babbler
into
the
kitchen
and
feed
him
quoth
earl
warrenne
and
so
the
colloquy
ended
into
the
kitchen
again
the
potter
went
the
king
s
luncheon
was
preparing
and
he
listened
to
their
chatter
and
picked
up
this
at
least
which
was
valuable
to
him
that
the
witches
story
was
true
that
a
great
attack
would
be
made
from
aldreth
that
boats
had
been
ordered
up
the
river
to
cotinglade
and
pioneers
and
entrenching
tools
were
to
be
sent
on
that
day
to
the
site
of
the
old
causeway
but
soon
he
had
to
take
care
of
himself
earl
warrenne
s
commands
to
feed
him
were
construed
by
the
and
scullions
into
a
command
to
make
him
drunk
likewise
to
make
a
of
an
englishman
was
too
tempting
a
jest
to
be
resisted
and
hereward
was
drenched
says
the
chronicler
with
wine
and
beer
and
sorely
baited
and
badgered
at
last
one
rascal
hit
upon
a
notable
plan
pluck
out
the
english
hog
s
hair
and
beard
and
put
him
blindfold
in
the
midst
of
his
pots
and
see
what
a
smash
we
shall
hereward
pretended
not
to
understand
the
words
which
were
spoken
in
french
but
when
they
were
interpreted
to
him
he
grew
somewhat
red
about
the
ears
submit
he
would
not
but
if
he
defended
himself
and
made
an
uproar
in
the
king
s
court
he
might
very
likely
find
himself
riding
odin
s
horse
before
the
hour
was
out
however
happily
for
him
the
wine
and
beer
had
made
him
stout
of
heart
and
when
one
fellow
laid
hold
of
his
beard
he
resisted
sturdily
the
man
struck
him
and
that
hard
hereward
hot
of
temper
and
careless
of
life
struck
him
again
right
under
the
ear
the
fellow
dropped
for
dead
up
leapt
scullions
who
hung
about
the
kitchen
to
lick
the
platters
and
all
the
rascality
of
a
great
mediaeval
household
and
attacked
hereward
fureis
et
tridentibus
with
forks
and
then
was
hereward
aware
of
a
great
broach
or
spit
before
the
fire
and
recollecting
how
he
had
used
such
a
one
as
a
boy
against
the
monks
of
peterborough
was
minded
to
use
it
against
the
cooks
of
brandon
which
he
did
so
heartily
that
in
a
few
moments
he
had
killed
one
and
driven
the
others
backward
in
a
heap
but
his
case
was
hopeless
he
was
soon
overpowered
by
numbers
from
outside
and
dragged
into
the
hall
to
receive
judgment
for
the
mortal
crime
of
slaying
a
man
within
the
precincts
of
the
court
he
kept
up
heart
he
knew
that
the
king
was
there
he
knew
that
he
should
most
likely
get
justice
from
the
king
if
not
he
could
but
discover
himself
and
so
save
his
life
for
that
the
king
would
kill
him
knowingly
he
did
not
believe
so
he
went
in
boldly
and
willingly
and
up
the
hall
where
on
the
dais
stood
william
the
norman
william
had
finished
his
luncheon
and
was
standing
at
the
board
side
a
page
held
water
in
a
silver
basin
in
which
he
was
washing
his
hands
two
more
knelt
and
laced
his
long
boots
for
he
was
as
always
going
then
hereward
looked
at
the
face
of
the
great
man
and
felt
at
once
that
it
was
the
face
of
the
greatest
man
whom
he
had
ever
met
i
am
not
that
man
s
match
said
he
to
himself
perhaps
it
will
all
end
in
being
his
man
and
he
my
silence
knaves
said
william
and
speak
one
of
you
at
a
time
how
came
this
a
likely
story
forsooth
said
he
when
he
had
heard
a
poor
english
potter
comes
into
my
court
and
murders
my
men
under
my
very
eyes
for
mere
sport
i
do
not
believe
you
rascals
you
churl
and
he
spoke
through
an
english
interpreter
tell
me
your
tale
and
justice
you
shall
have
or
take
as
you
deserve
i
am
the
king
of
england
man
and
i
know
your
tongue
though
i
speak
it
not
yet
more
hereward
fell
on
his
knees
if
you
are
indeed
my
lord
the
king
then
i
am
safe
for
there
is
justice
in
you
at
least
so
all
men
and
he
told
his
tale
manfully
splendeur
dex
but
this
is
a
far
likelier
story
and
i
believe
it
hark
you
you
ruffians
here
am
i
trying
to
conciliate
these
english
by
justice
and
mercy
whenever
they
will
let
me
and
here
are
you
outraging
them
and
driving
them
mad
and
desperate
just
that
you
may
get
a
handle
against
them
and
thus
rob
the
poor
wretches
and
drive
them
into
the
forest
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
from
ivo
taillebois
there
down
to
you
you
are
all
at
the
same
game
and
i
will
stop
it
the
next
time
i
hear
of
outrage
to
unarmed
man
or
harmless
woman
i
will
hang
that
culprit
were
he
odo
my
brother
this
excellent
speech
was
enforced
with
oaths
so
strange
and
terrible
that
ivo
taillebois
shook
in
his
boots
and
the
chaplain
prayed
fervently
that
the
roof
might
not
fall
in
on
their
heads
thou
smilest
man
said
william
quickly
to
the
kneeling
hereward
so
thou
understandest
french
a
few
words
only
most
gracious
king
which
we
potters
pick
up
wandering
everywhere
with
our
wares
said
hereward
speaking
in
french
for
so
keen
was
william
s
eye
that
he
thought
it
safer
to
play
no
tricks
with
him
nevertheless
he
made
his
french
so
execrable
that
the
very
scullions
grinned
in
spite
of
their
fear
look
you
said
william
you
are
no
common
churl
you
have
fought
too
well
for
that
let
me
see
your
hereward
drew
up
his
sleeve
potters
do
not
carry
like
those
neither
are
they
tattooed
like
english
thanes
hold
up
thy
head
man
and
let
us
see
thy
hereward
who
had
carefully
hung
down
his
head
to
prevent
his
being
seen
was
forced
to
lift
it
up
aha
so
i
expected
more
fair
ladies
work
there
is
not
this
he
who
was
said
to
be
so
like
hereward
very
good
put
him
in
ward
till
i
come
back
from
hunting
but
do
him
no
harm
for
and
william
fixed
on
hereward
eyes
of
the
most
intense
intelligence
were
he
hereward
himself
i
should
be
right
glad
to
see
hereward
safe
and
sound
my
man
at
last
and
earl
of
all
between
humber
and
the
but
hereward
did
not
rise
at
the
bait
with
a
face
of
stupid
and
ludicrous
terror
he
made
reply
in
broken
french
have
mercy
mercy
lord
king
make
not
that
fiend
earl
over
us
even
ivo
taillebois
there
would
be
better
than
he
send
him
to
be
earl
over
the
imps
in
hell
or
over
the
wild
welsh
who
are
worse
still
but
not
over
us
good
lord
king
whom
he
hath
polled
and
peeled
till
we
are
silence
said
william
laughing
as
did
all
round
him
thou
art
a
cunning
rogue
enough
whoever
thou
art
go
into
limbo
and
behave
thyself
till
i
come
all
saints
send
your
grace
good
sport
and
thereby
me
a
good
deliverance
quoth
hereward
who
knew
that
his
fate
might
depend
on
the
temper
in
which
william
returned
so
he
was
thrust
into
an
outhouse
and
there
locked
up
he
sat
on
an
empty
barrel
meditating
on
the
chances
of
his
submitting
to
the
king
after
all
when
the
door
opened
and
in
strode
one
with
a
drawn
sword
in
one
hand
and
a
pair
of
in
the
other
hold
out
thy
shins
fellow
thou
art
not
going
to
sit
at
thine
ease
there
like
an
abbot
after
killing
one
of
us
grooms
and
bringing
the
rest
of
us
into
disgrace
hold
out
thy
legs
i
say
nothing
easier
quoth
hereward
cheerfully
and
held
out
a
leg
but
when
the
man
stooped
to
put
on
the
fetters
he
received
a
kick
which
sent
him
staggering
after
which
he
recollected
very
little
at
least
in
this
world
for
hereward
cut
off
his
head
with
his
own
sword
after
which
says
the
chronicler
he
broke
away
out
of
the
house
and
over
garden
walls
and
palings
hiding
and
running
till
he
got
to
the
front
gate
and
leaped
upon
mare
swallow
and
none
saw
him
save
one
unlucky
who
stood
yelling
and
cursing
in
front
of
the
mare
s
head
and
went
to
seize
the
bridle
whereon
between
the
imminent
danger
and
the
bad
language
hereward
s
blood
rose
and
he
smote
that
unlucky
but
whether
he
slew
him
or
not
the
chronicler
had
rather
not
say
then
he
shook
up
mare
swallow
and
rode
for
his
life
with
knights
and
squires
for
the
hue
and
cry
was
raised
galloping
at
her
heels
who
then
were
astonished
but
those
knights
as
they
saw
the
ugly
potter
s
garron
gaining
on
them
length
after
length
till
she
and
her
rider
had
left
them
far
behind
who
then
was
proud
but
hereward
as
the
mare
tucked
her
great
thighs
under
her
and
swept
on
over
heath
and
rabbit
burrow
over
rush
and
fen
sound
ground
and
rotten
all
alike
to
that
enormous
stride
to
that
keen
bright
eye
which
foresaw
every
footfall
to
that
raking
shoulder
which
picked
her
up
again
at
every
stagger
hereward
laid
the
bridle
on
her
neck
and
let
her
go
fall
she
could
not
and
tire
she
could
not
and
he
half
wished
she
might
go
on
forever
where
could
a
man
be
better
than
on
a
good
horse
with
all
the
cares
of
this
life
blown
away
out
of
his
brains
by
the
keen
air
which
rushed
around
his
temples
and
he
galloped
on
as
cheery
as
a
boy
shouting
at
the
rabbits
as
they
scuttled
from
under
his
feet
and
laughing
at
the
dottrel
as
they
postured
and
anticked
on
the
but
think
he
must
at
last
of
how
to
get
home
for
to
go
through
mildenhall
again
would
not
be
safe
and
he
turned
over
the
moors
to
icklingham
and
where
he
went
after
no
man
can
tell
certainly
not
the
chronicler
for
he
tells
how
hereward
got
back
by
the
isle
of
somersham
which
is
all
but
impossible
for
somersham
is
in
huntingdonshire
many
a
mile
on
the
opposite
side
of
ely
isle
and
of
all
those
knights
that
followed
him
none
ever
saw
or
heard
sign
of
him
save
one
and
his
horse
came
to
a
standstill
in
the
aforesaid
wood
which
the
chronicler
says
was
somersham
and
he
rolled
off
his
horse
and
lay
breathless
under
a
tree
looking
up
at
his
horse
s
heaving
flanks
and
wagging
tail
and
wondering
how
he
should
get
out
of
that
place
before
the
english
found
him
and
made
an
end
of
him
then
there
came
up
to
him
a
ragged
churl
and
asked
him
who
he
was
and
offered
to
help
him
for
the
sake
of
god
and
courtesy
quoth
he
his
norman
pride
being
wellnigh
beat
out
of
him
if
thou
hast
seen
or
heard
anything
of
hereward
good
fellow
tell
me
and
i
will
repay
thee
as
thou
hast
asked
me
for
the
sake
of
god
and
of
courtesy
sir
knight
i
will
tell
thee
i
am
hereward
and
in
token
thereof
thou
shalt
give
me
up
thy
lance
and
sword
and
take
instead
this
sword
which
i
carried
off
from
the
king
s
court
and
promise
me
on
the
faith
of
a
knight
to
bear
it
back
to
king
william
and
tell
him
that
hereward
and
he
have
met
at
last
and
that
he
had
best
beware
of
the
day
when
they
shall
meet
so
that
knight
not
having
recovered
his
wind
was
fain
to
submit
and
go
home
a
sadder
and
a
wiser
man
and
king
william
laughed
a
royal
laugh
and
commanded
his
knights
that
they
should
in
no
wise
harm
hereward
but
take
him
alive
and
bring
him
in
and
they
should
have
great
rewards
which
seemed
to
them
more
easily
said
than
done
chapter
xxxi
how
they
fought
again
at
aldreth
hereward
came
back
in
fear
and
trembling
after
all
he
believed
in
the
magic
powers
of
the
witch
of
brandon
and
he
asked
torfrida
in
his
simplicity
whether
she
was
not
cunning
enough
to
defeat
her
spells
by
counter
spells
torfrida
smiled
and
shook
her
head
my
knight
i
have
long
since
given
up
such
vanities
let
us
not
fight
evil
with
evil
but
rather
with
good
better
are
prayers
than
charms
for
the
former
are
heard
in
heaven
above
and
the
latter
only
in
the
pit
below
let
me
and
all
the
women
of
ely
go
rather
in
procession
to
etheldreda
s
well
there
above
the
fort
at
aldreth
and
pray
etheldreda
to
be
with
us
when
the
day
shall
come
and
defend
her
own
isle
and
the
honor
of
us
women
who
have
taken
refuge
in
her
holy
so
all
the
women
of
ely
walked
out
barefoot
to
etheldreda
s
well
with
torfrida
at
their
head
clothed
in
sackcloth
and
with
fetters
on
her
wrists
and
waist
and
ankles
which
she
vowed
after
the
strange
sudden
earnest
fashion
of
those
times
never
to
take
off
again
till
she
saw
the
french
host
flee
from
aldreth
before
the
face
of
etheldreda
so
they
prayed
while
hereward
and
his
men
worked
at
the
forts
below
and
when
they
came
back
and
torfrida
was
washing
her
feet
sore
and
bleeding
from
her
pilgrimage
hereward
came
in
you
have
murdered
your
poor
soft
feet
and
taken
nothing
thereby
i
i
have
if
i
had
walked
on
sharp
razors
all
the
way
i
would
have
done
it
gladly
to
know
what
i
know
now
as
i
prayed
i
looked
out
over
the
fen
and
etheldreda
put
a
thought
into
my
heart
but
it
is
so
terrible
a
one
that
i
fear
to
tell
it
to
you
and
yet
it
seems
our
only
hereward
threw
himself
at
her
feet
and
prayed
her
to
tell
at
last
she
spoke
as
one
half
afraid
of
her
own
words
will
the
reeds
burn
hereward
hereward
kissed
her
feet
again
and
again
calling
her
his
prophetess
his
savior
burn
yes
like
tinder
in
this
march
wind
if
the
drought
only
holds
pray
that
the
drought
may
hold
there
there
say
no
more
how
war
makes
even
us
women
there
help
me
to
take
off
this
rough
sackcloth
and
dress
myself
meanwhile
william
had
moved
his
army
again
to
cambridge
and
on
to
willingham
field
and
there
he
began
to
throw
up
those
globos
and
montanas
of
which
leofric
s
paraphraser
talks
but
of
which
now
no
trace
remains
then
he
began
to
rebuild
his
causeway
broader
and
stronger
and
commanded
all
the
fishermen
of
the
ouse
to
bring
their
boats
to
cotinglade
and
ferry
over
his
materials
among
whom
came
hereward
in
his
boat
with
head
and
beard
shaven
lest
he
should
be
known
and
worked
diligently
among
the
rest
but
the
sun
did
not
set
that
day
without
mischief
for
before
hereward
went
off
he
finished
his
work
by
setting
the
whole
on
fire
so
that
it
was
all
burnt
and
some
of
the
french
killed
and
and
so
he
went
on
with
stratagems
and
ambushes
till
after
seven
days
continual
fighting
they
had
hardly
done
one
day
s
work
save
four
globos
of
wood
in
which
they
intended
to
put
their
artillery
but
on
the
eighth
day
they
determined
to
attack
the
isle
putting
in
the
midst
of
them
that
pythoness
woman
on
a
high
place
where
she
might
be
safe
freely
to
exercise
her
it
was
not
hereward
alone
who
had
entreated
torfrida
to
exercise
her
magic
art
in
their
behalf
but
she
steadily
refused
and
made
good
abbot
thurstan
support
her
refusal
by
a
strict
declaration
that
he
would
have
no
fiends
games
played
in
ely
as
long
as
he
was
abbot
alive
on
land
torfrida
meanwhile
grew
utterly
wild
her
conscience
smote
her
in
spite
of
her
belief
that
etheldreda
had
inspired
her
at
the
terrible
resource
which
she
had
hinted
to
her
husband
and
which
she
knew
well
he
would
carry
out
with
terrible
success
pictures
of
agony
and
death
floated
before
her
eyes
and
kept
her
awake
at
night
she
watched
long
hours
in
the
church
in
prayer
she
fasted
she
disciplined
her
tender
body
with
sharp
pains
she
tried
after
the
fashion
of
those
times
to
atone
for
her
sin
if
sin
it
was
at
last
she
had
worked
herself
up
into
a
religious
frenzy
she
saw
etheldreda
in
the
clouds
towering
over
the
isle
menacing
the
french
host
with
her
virgin
she
uttered
wild
prophecies
of
ruin
and
defeat
to
the
french
and
then
when
her
frenzy
collapsed
moaned
secretly
of
ruin
and
defeat
hereafter
to
themselves
but
she
would
be
bold
she
would
play
her
part
she
would
encourage
the
heroes
who
looked
to
her
as
one
inspired
wiser
and
loftier
than
themselves
and
so
it
befell
that
when
the
men
marched
down
to
haddenham
that
afternoon
torfrida
rode
at
their
head
on
a
white
charger
robed
from
throat
to
ankle
in
sackcloth
her
fetters
clanking
on
her
limbs
but
she
called
on
the
english
to
see
in
her
the
emblem
of
england
captive
yet
unconquered
and
to
break
her
fetters
and
the
worse
fetters
of
every
woman
in
england
who
was
the
toy
and
slave
of
the
brutal
invaders
and
so
fierce
a
triumph
sparkled
from
her
wild
that
the
englishmen
looked
up
to
her
weird
beauty
as
to
that
of
an
inspired
saint
and
when
the
normans
came
on
to
the
assault
there
stood
on
a
grassy
mound
behind
the
english
fort
a
figure
clothed
in
sackcloth
barefooted
and
bareheaded
with
fetters
shining
on
waist
and
wrist
and
ankle
her
long
black
locks
streaming
in
the
wind
her
long
white
arms
stretched
crosswise
toward
heaven
in
imitation
of
moses
of

above
the
battle
with
amalek
invoking
etheldreda
and
all
the
powers
of
heaven
and
chanting
doom
and
defiance
to
the
invaders
and
the
english
looked
on
her
and
cried
she
is
a
prophetess
we
will
surely
do
some
great
deed
this
day
or
die
around
her
feet
like
heroes
and
opposite
to
her
upon
the
norman
tower
the
old
hag
of
brandon
howled
and
gibbered
with
filthy
gestures
calling
for
the
which
did
not
come
for
all
above
the
sky
was
cloudless
blue
and
the
english
saw
and
felt
though
they
could
not
speak
it
dumb
nation
as
they
were
the
contrast
between
the
spirit
of
cruelty
and
darkness
and
the
spirit
of
freedom
and
light
so
strong
was
the
new
bridge
that
william
trusted
himself
upon
it
on
horseback
with
ivo
taillebois
at
his
side
william
doubted
the
powers
of
the
witch
and
felt
rather
ashamed
of
his
new
helpmate
but
he
was
confident
in
his
bridge
and
in
the
heavy
artillery
which
he
had
placed
in
his
four
towers
ivo
taillebois
was
utterly
confident
in
his
witch
and
in
the
bridge
likewise
william
waited
for
the
rising
of
the
tide
and
when
the
tide
was
near
its
height
he
commanded
the
artillery
to
open
and
clear
the
fort
opposite
of
the
english
then
with
crash
and
twang
the
balistas
and
catapults
went
off
and
great
stones
and
heavy
lances
hurtled
through
the
air
back
shouted
torfrida
raised
almost
to
madness
by
fasting
and
religious
frenzy
out
of
yon
fort
every
man
why
waste
your
lives
under
that
artillery
stand
still
this
day
and
see
how
the
saints
of
heaven
shall
fight
for
so
utter
was
the
reverence
which
she
commanded
for
the
moment
that
every
man
drew
back
and
crowded
round
her
feet
outside
the
fort
the
cowards
are
fleeing
already
let
your
men
go

king
shouted
taillebois
on
to
the
assault

william

said
he
to
himself
that
this
is
some
stratagem
of

the
evening
breeze
curled
up
the
reach
the
great
pike
splashed
out
from
the
weedy
shores
and
sent
the
flying
in
shoals
into
the
low
glare
of
the
setting
sun
and
heeded
not
stupid
things
the
barges
packed
with
mailed
men
which
swarmed
in
the
reeds
on
either
side
the
bridge
and
began
to
push
out
into
the
river
the
starlings
swung
in
thousands
round
the
looking
to
settle
in
their
wonted
place
but
dare
not
and
rose
and
swung
round
again
telling
each
other
in
their
manifold
pipings
how
all
the
teemed
with
mailed
men
and
all
above
the
sky
was
cloudless
blue
and
then
came
a
trample
a
roll
of
many
feet
on
the
soft
spongy
peat
a
low
murmur
which
rose
into
wild
shouts
of
dex

as
a
human
tide
poured
along
the

said
william
there
was
twenty
yards
of
deep
clear
water
between
frenchman
and
englishman
only
twenty
yards
not
only
the
arrows
and
arblast
quarrels
but
heavy
flew
across
every
moment
every
now
and
then
a
man
toppled
forward
and
plunged
into
the
blue
depth
among
the
eels
and
pike
to
find
his
comrades
of
the
summer
before
then
the
stream
was
still
once
more
the
coots
and
swam
in
and
out
of
the
reeds
and
wondered
what
it
was
all
about
the
flapped
upon
the
ripple
as
lonely
as
in
the
loneliest
mere
but
their
floats
were
soon
broken
their
white
cups
stained
with
human
gore
twenty
yards
of
deep
clear
water
and
treasure
inestimable
to
win
by
crossing
it
they
thrust
out
baulks
canoes
pontoons
they
crawled
upon
them
like
ants
and
thrust
out
more
yet
beyond
heedless
of
their
comrades
who
slipped
and
splashed
and
sank
holding
out
vain
hands
to
hands
too
busy
to
seize
them
and
always
the
old
witch
jabbered
overhead
with
her
cantrips
pointing
mumming
praying
for
the
storm
while
all
above
the
sky
was
cloudless
blue
and
always
on
the
mound
opposite
while
darts
and
quarrels
whistled
round
her
head
stood
torfrida
pointing
with
outstretched
scornful
finger
at
the
stragglers
in
the
river
and
chanting
loudly
what
the
frenchmen
could
not
tell
but
it
made
their
hearts
as
it
was
meant
to
do
melt
like
wax
within
them
they
have
a
counter
witch
to
yours
ivo
it
seems
and
a
fairer
one
i
am
afraid
the
devils
especially
if
asmodeus
be
at
hand
are
more
likely
to
listen
to
her
than
to
that
old
fair
is
that
fair

sir
a
good
argument
for
honest
men

none
for

earnestly

somewhat
among

to

will
say
for

torfrida
s
bold
song
coming
clear
and
sweet
across
the
water
rose
louder
and
shriller
till
it
almost
drowned
the
jabbering
of
the

clean
through

from

the
bits
of

wretched
old

injured

they
said
were
stronger

theirs
or
than
the
daring
of
brave
men
let
william
take
torfrida
and
burn
her
as
she
had
burned
them
with

out
of

torfrida

exhausted

and
the

weight
of

sustained
during

passion
weighed
her
down
she
dropped
senseless
on

in

trance
for
many
hours

arose

chapter
xxxii
how
king
william
took
counsel
of
a
churchman
if
torfrida
was
exhausted
so
was
hereward
likewise
he
knew
well
that
a
repulse
was
not
a
defeat
he
knew
well
the
indomitable
persistence
the
boundless
resources
of
the
mastermind
whom
he
defied
and
he
knew
well
that
another
attempt
would
be
made
and
then
another
till
though
it
took
seven
years
in
the
doing
ely
would
be
won
at
last
to
hold
out
doggedly
as
long
as
he
could
was
his
plan
to
obtain
the
best
terms
he
could
for
his
comrades
and
he
might
obtain
good
terms
at
last
william
might
be
glad
to
pay
a
fair
price
in
order
to
escape
such
a
thorn
in
his
side
as
the
camp
of
refuge
and
might
deal
or
at
least
promise
to
deal
mercifully
and
generously
with
the
last
remnant
of
the
english
gentry
for
himself
yield
he
would
not
when
all
was
over
he
would
flee
to
the
sea
with
torfrida
and
his
own
housecarles
and
turn
viking
or
go
to
sweyn
ulfsson
in
denmark
and
die
a
free
man
the
english
did
not
foresee
these
things
their
hearts
were
lifted
up
with
their
victory
and
they
laughed
at
william
and
his
french
and
drank
torfrida
s
health
much
too
often
for
their
own
good
hereward
did
not
care
to
undeceive
them
but
he
could
not
help
speaking
his
mind
in
the
abbot
s
chamber
to
thurstan
egelwin
and
his
nephews
and
to
sigtryg
ranaldsson
who
was
still
in
ely
not
only
because
he
had
promised
to
stay
there
but
because
he
could
not
get
out
if
he
would
blockaded
they
were
utterly
by
land
and
water
the
isle
furnished
a
fair
supply
of
food
and
what
was
wanting
they
obtained
by
foraging
but
they
had
laid
the
land
waste
for
so
many
miles
round
that
their
plundering
raids
brought
them
in
less
than
of
old
and
if
they
went
far
they
fell
in
with
the
french
and
lost
good
men
even
though
they
were
generally
successful
so
provisions
were
running
somewhat
short
and
would
run
shorter
still
moreover
there
was
a
great
cause
of
anxiety
bishop
egelwin
abbot
thurstan
and
the
monks
of
ely
were
in
rebellion
not
only
against
king
william
but
more
or
less
against
the
pope
of
rome
they
might
be
excommunicated
the
minster
lands
might
be
taken
away
bishop
egelwin
set
his
face
like
a
flint
he
expected
no
mercy
all
he
had
ever
done
for
the
french
was
to
warn
robert
comyn
that
if
he
stayed
in
durham
evil
would
befall
him
but
that
was
as
little
worth
to
him
as
it
was
to
the
said
robert
and
no
mercy
he
craved
the
less
a
man
had
the
more
fit
he
was
for
heaven
he
could
but
die
and
that
he
had
known
ever
since
he
was
a
whether
he
died
in
ely
or
in
prison
mattered
little
to
him
provided
they
did
not
refuse
him
the
sacraments
and
that
they
would
hardly
do
but
call
the
duke
of
normandy
his
rightful
sovereign
he
would
not
because
he
was
not
nor
anybody
else
just
now
as
far
as
he
could
see
valiant
likewise
was
abbot
thurstan
for
himself
but
he
had
unlike
bishop
egelwin
whose
diocese
had
been
given
to
a
frenchman
an
abbey
monks
and
broad
lands
whereof
he
was
father
and
steward
and
he
must
do
what
was
best
for
the
abbey
and
also
what
the
monks
would
let
him
do
for
severe
as
was
the
discipline
of
a
minster
in
time
of
peace
yet
in
time
of
war
when
life
and
death
were
in
question
monks
had
ere
now
turned
valiant
from
very
fear
like
cato
s
mouse
and
mutinied
and
so
might
the
monks
of
ely
and
edwin
and
morcar
no
man
knows
what
they
said
or
thought
perhaps
no
man
cared
much
even
in
their
own
days
no
hint
does
any
chronicler
give
of
what
manner
of
men
they
were
or
what
manner
of
deeds
they
did
fair
gentle
noble
beloved
even
by
william
they
are
mere
names
and
nothing
more
in
history
and
it
is
to
be
supposed
therefore
that
they
were
nothing
more
in
fact
the
race
of
leofric
and
godiva
had
worn
itself
out
one
night
the
confederates
had
sat
late
talking
over
the
future
more
earnestly
than
usual
edwin
usually
sad
enough
was
especially
sad
that
night
hereward
jested
with
him
tried
to
cheer
him
but
he
was
silent
would
not
drink
and
went
away
before
the
rest
the
next
morning
he
was
gone
and
with
him
half
a
dozen
of
his
private
housecarles
hereward
was
terrified
if
defections
once
began
they
would
be
endless
the
camp
would
fall
to
pieces
and
every
man
among
them
would
be
hanged
mutilated
or
imprisoned
one
by
one
helplessly
they
must
stand
or
fall
together
he
went
raging
to
morcar
morcar
knew
naught
of
it
on
the
faith
and
honor
of
a
knight
he
knew
naught
only
his
brother
had
said
to
him
a
day
or
two
before
that
he
must
see
his
betrothed
before
he
died
he
is
gone
to
william
then
does
he
think
to
win
her
now
an
outcast
and
a
beggar
when
he
was
refused
her
with
broad
lands
and
a
thousand
men
at
his
back

see
that
thou
play
not
the
fool
likewise

or
what
said
morcar
defiantly
or
thou
wilt
go
whither
edwin
is
gone
to
betrayal
and
why
so
he
has
been
kind
enough
to
waltheof
and
gospatrick
why
not
to
edwin
because
laughed
hereward
he
wanted

he
does
not

north
as
you
should
know
already
and
must
have
one
of
themselves
over
them
to
keep
them
in
good
humor
for
a
while
when
he
has
used
waltheof
as
his
long
enough
to
build
a

every
ten
miles
he
will
throw
him
away

hour
how
well
have
you
kept
your
own
twice
a
rebel
that
you
should
appeal
to
mine
take
him
and
hang
him
asked
ivo
taillebois
pish
no
thou
old
butcher
put
him
in
irons
and
send
him
into
send
him
to
roger
de
beaumont
sire
roger
s
son
is
safe
in
morcar
s
castle
at
warwick
so
it
is
but
fair
that
morcar
should
be
safe
in
roger
and
to
roger
de
beaumont
he
was
sent
while
young
roger
was
lord
of
warwick
and
all
around
that
once
was
leofric
and
godiva
s
morcar
lay
in
a
norman
keep
till
the
day
of
william
s
death
on
his
the
tyrant
s
heart
smote
him
and
he
sent
orders
to
release
him
for
a
few
short
days
or
hours
he
breathed
free
air
again
then
rufus
shut
him
up
once
more
and
forever
and
that
was
the
end
of
earl
morcar
a
few
weeks
after
three
men
came
to
the
camp
at
brandon
and
they
brought
a
head
to
the
king
and
when
william
looked
upon
it
it
was
the
head
of
edwin
the
human
heart
must
have
burst
up
again
in
the
tyrant
as
he
looked
on
the
fair
face
of
him
he
had
so
loved
and
so
wronged
for
they
say
he
wept
the
knights
and
earls
stood
round
amazed
and
awed
as
they
saw
iron
tears
ran
down
pluto
s
cheek
how
came
this
here
knaves
thundered
he
at
last
they
told
a
rambling
story
how
edwin
always
would
needs
go
to
winchester
to
see
the
queen
for
she
would
stand
his
friend
and
do
him
right
and
how
they
could
not
get
to
winchester
for
fear
of
the
french
and
wandered
in
woods
and
wolds
and
how
they
were
set
upon
and
hunted
and
how
edwin
still
was
mad
to
go
to
winchester
but
when
he
could
not
he
would
go
to
blethwallon
and
his
welsh
and
how
earl
randal
of
chester
set
upon
them
and
how
they
got
between
a
stream
and
the
of
the
dee
and
were
cut
off
and
how
edwin
would
not
yield
and
how
then
they
slew
him
in
and
randal
let
them
bring
the
head
to
the
king
this
or
something
like
it
was
their
story
but
who
could
believe
traitors
where
edwin
wandered
what
he
did
during
those
months
no
man
knows
all
that
is
known
is
three
men
brought
his
head
to
william
and
told
some
such
tale
and
so
the
old
nobility
of
england
died
up
and
down
the
ruts
and
shaughs
like
wounded
birds
and
as
of
wounded
birds
none
knew
or
cared
how
far
they
had
run
or
how
their
broken
bones
had
ached
before
they
died
out
of
their
own
mouths
they
are
condemned
says
holy
writ
thundered
william
hang
them
on
and
hanged
on
high
they
were
on
brandon
heath
then
the
king
turned
on
his
courtiers
glad
to
ease
his
own
conscience
by
cursing
them
this
is
your
doing
sirs
if
i
had
not
listened
to
your
base
counsels
edwin
might
have
been
now
my
faithful
liegeman
and
my
and
i
had
had
one
more
englishman
left
in
peace
and
one
less
sin
upon
my
and
one
less
thorn
in
thy
side
quoth
ivo
taillebois
who
spoke
to
thee
ralph
guader
thou
gavest
me
the
counsel
thou
wilt
answer
it
to
god
and
his
that
did
i
not
it
was
earl
roger
because
he
wanted
the
man
s
shropshire
whereon
high
words
ensued
and
the
king
gave
the
earl
the
lie
in
his
teeth
which
the
earl
did
not
forget
i
think
said
the
rough
shrewd
voice
of
ivo
that
instead
of
crying
over
spilt
milk
for
milk
the
lad
was
and
never
would
have
grown
to
good
beef
had
he
lived
to
my
age
who
spoke
to
thee
no
man
and
for
that
reason
i
spoke
myself
i
have
lands
in
spalding
by
your
majesty
s
grace
and
wish
to
enjoy
them
in
peace
having
worked
for
them
hard
enough
and
how
can
i
do
that
as
long
as
hereward
sits
in
ely
splendeur
dex
said
william
them
art
right
old
so
they
laid
their
heads
together
to
slay
hereward
and
after
they
had
talked
awhile
then
spoke
william
s
chaplain
for
the
nonce
an
italian
a
friend
and
pupil
of
lanfranc
of
pavia
an
italian
also
then
archbishop
of
canterbury
scourging
and
imprisoning
english
monks
in
the
south
and
he
spoke
like
an
italian
of
those
times
who
knew
the
ways
of
rome
if
his
majesty
will
allow
my
humility
to
suggest
what
thy
humility
is
proud
enough
under
the
rose
i
will
warrant
but
it
has
a
roman
wit
under
the
rose
likewise
speak
that
when
the
secular
and
carnal
arm
has
failed
as
it
is
written
footnote
i
do
not
laugh
at
holy
scripture
myself
i
only
insert
this
as
a
specimen
of
the
usual
mediaeval
cant
a
name
and
a
practice
which
are
both
derived
not
from
puritans
but
from
monks
he
poureth
contempt
upon
princes
and
letteth
them
wander
out
of
the
way
in
the
wilderness
or
fens
for
the
latin
word
and
i
doubt
not
the
hebrew
has
both
splendeur
dex
cried
william
bitterly
that
hath
he
done
with
a
vengeance
thou
art
right
so
far
clerk
yet
helpeth
he
the
poor
videlicet
his
church
and
the
religious
who
are
vowed
to
holy
poverty
out
of
misery
videlicet
the
oppression
of
barbarous
customs
and
maketh
them
households
like
a
flock
of
they
do
that
for
themselves
already
here
in
england
said
william
with
a
sneer
at
the
fancied
morals
of
the
english
monks
and
clergy
footnote
the
alleged
profligacy
and
sensuality
of
the
english
church
before
the
conquest
rests
merely
on
a
few
violent
and
vague
expressions
of
the
norman
monks
who
displaced
them
no
facts
as
far
as
i
can
find
have
ever
been
alleged
and
without
facts
on
the
other
side
an
impartial
man
will
hold
by
the
one
fact
which
is
certain
that
the
church
of
england
popish
as
it
was
was
unfortunately
for
it
not
popish
enough
and
from
its
insular
freedom
obnoxious
to
the
church
of
rome
and
the
ultramontane
clergy
of
normandy
and
was
therefore
to
be
believed
capable
and
therefore
again
accused
of
any
and
every
crime
but
heaven
and
not
the
church
does
it
for
the
true
poor
whom
your
majesty
is
bringing
in
to
your
endless
but
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
taking
ely
asked
william
impatiently
i
asked
thee
for
reason
and
not
this
that
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
holy
father
and
that
power
he
would
doubtless
allow
you
as
his
dear
son
and
most
faithful
servant
to
employ
for
yourself
without
sending
to
rome
which
might
cause
painful
delays
to
it
might
seem
strange
that
william
taillebois
guader
warrenne
warriors
could
allow
complacently
a
smooth
churchman
to
dawdle
on
like
this
counting
his
periods
on
his
fingers
and
seemingly
never
coming
to
the
point
but
they
knew
well
that
the
churchman
was
a
far
cunninger
as
well
as
a
more
learned
man
than
themselves
they
knew
well
that
they
could
not
hurry
him
and
that
they
need
not
that
he
would
make
his
point
at
last
hunting
it
out
step
by
step
and
letting
them
see
how
he
got
thither
like
a
cunning
hound
they
knew
that
if
he
spoke
he
had
thought
long
and
craftily
till
he
had
made
up
his
mind
and
that
therefore
he
would
very
probably
make
up
their
minds
likewise
it
was
as
usual
in
that
age
the
conquest
not
of
a
heavenly
spirit
though
it
boasted
itself
such
but
of
a
cultivated
mind
over
brute
flesh
they
might
have
said
all
this
aloud
and
yet
the
churchman
would
have
gone
on
as
he
did
where
he
left
off
with
unaltered
blandness
of
tone
to
convert
to
other
uses
the
goods
of
the
church
to
convert
them
to
profane
uses
would
i
need
not
say
be
a
sacrilege
as
horrible
to
heaven
as
impossible
to
so
pious
a
monarch
ivo
taillebois
winced
he
had
just
stolen
a
manor
from
the
monks
of
crowland
and
meant
to
keep
it
church
lands
belonging
to
abbeys
or
sees
whose
abbots
or
bishops
are
contumaciously
disobedient
to
the
holy
see
or
to
their
lawful
monarch
he
being
in
the
communion
of
the
church
and
at
peace
with
the
said
holy
see
if
therefore
to
come
to
that
point
at
which
my
incapacity
through
the
devious
windings
of
my
own
simplicity
has
been
tending
but
with
halting
steps
from
the
moment
that
your
majesty
deigned
to
hear
put
in
the
spur
man
said
ivo
tired
at
last
and
run
the
deer
to
hurry
no
man
s
cattle
especially
thine
own
answered
the
churchman
with
so
shrewd
a
wink
and
so
cheery
a
voice
that
ivo
when
he
recovered
from
his
surprise
cried
why
thou
art
a
good
huntsman
thyself
i
believe
all
things
to
all
men
if
by
any
means
but
to
return
if
your
majesty
should
think
fit
to
proclaim
to
the
recalcitrants
of
ely
that
unless
they
submit
themselves
to
your
royal
grace
and
to
that
of
course
of
his
holiness
our
father
within
a
certain
day
you
will
convert
to
other
uses
premising
to
avoid
scandal
that
those
uses
shall
be
for
the
benefit
of
holy
church
all
lands
and
manors
of
theirs
lying
without
the
precincts
of
the
isle
of
ely
those
lands
being
as
is
known
large
and
of
great
value
quid
plura
why
burden
your
exalted
intellect
by
detailing
to
you
consequences
which
it
has
long
ere
now
quoth
william
who
was
as
sharp
as
the
italian
and
had
seen
it
all
i
will
make
thee
a
bishop
spare
to
burden
my
weakness
said
the
chaplain
and
slipt
away
into
the
shade
you
will
take
his
advice
asked
ivo
i
then
i
shall
see
that
torfrida
burn
at
burn
her
and
william
swore
i
promised
my
soldiers
to
burn
the
witch
with
reeds
out
of
haddenham
fen
as
she
had
burned
them
and
i
must
keep
my
knightly
william
swore
yet
more
ivo
taillebois
was
a
butcher
and
a
churl
call
me
not
butcher
and
churl
too
often
lord
king
ere
thou
hast
found
whether
thou
needest
me
or
not
rough
i
may
be
false
was
i
that
thou
wert
not
said
william
who
needed
taillebois
much
and
feared
him
somewhat
and
remarked
something
meaning
in
his
voice
which
made
him
calm
himself
diplomat
as
he
was
instantly
but
burn
torfrida
thou
shalt
well
i
care
not
i
have
seen
a
woman
burnt
ere
now
and
had
no
fancy
for
the
screeching
beside
they
say
she
is
a
very
fair
dame
and
has
a
fair
daughter
too
coming
on
and
she
may
very
well
make
a
wife
for
a
marry
her
i
shall
have
to
kill
hereward
then
do
it
and
i
will
give
thee
his
i
may
have
to
kill
others
before
you
may
and
so
the
matter
dropped
but
william
caught
ivo
alone
after
an
hour
and
asked
him
what
he
meant
no
pay
no
play
lord
king
i
have
served
thee
well
rough
and
thou
hast
and
hast
been
well
paid
but
if
i
have
said
aught
hasty
pish
majesty
i
am
a
man
and
like
a
master
but
instead
of
marrying
torfrida
or
her
daughter
i
have
more
mind
to
her
niece
who
is
younger
and
has
no
hereward
to
be
killed
her
niece
who
lucia
as
we
call
her
edwin
and
morcar
s
sister
hereward
s
niece
torfrida
s
no
pay
no
play
saidst
thou
so
say
i
what
meant
you
by
having
to
kill
others
before
hereward
beware
of
waltheof
said
ivo
waltheof
pish
this
is
one
of
thy
inventions
for
making
me
hunt
every
englishman
to
death
that
thou
mayest
gnaw
their
is
it
then
this
i
say
more
beware
of
ralph
guader
pish
pish
on
lord
etiquette
was
not
yet
discovered
by
norman
barons
and
earls
who
thought
themselves
all
but
as
good
as
their
king
gave
him
their
advice
when
they
thought
fit
and
if
he
did
not
take
it
attacked
him
with
all
their
meinie
pish
on
but
listen
beware
of
roger
and
what
more
and
give
me
lucia
i
want
her
i
will
have
william
laughed
thou
of
all
men
to
mix
that
with
that
wine
they
were
mixed
in
thy
blood
lord
king
and
thou
art
the
better
man
for
it
so
says
the
world
old
wine
and
old
blood
throw
any
lees
to
the
bottom
of
the
cask
and
we
shall
have
a
son
worthy
to
ride
behind
take
care
quoth
william
the
greatest
captain
upon
william
laughed
again
like
odin
s
self
thou
shalt
have
lucia
for
that
and
thou
shalt
have
the
plot
ere
it
breaks
as
it
to
this
have
i
come
at
last
said
william
to
himself
as
they
parted
to
murder
these
english
nobles
to
marry
their
daughters
to
my
grooms
heaven
forgive
me
they
have
brought
it
upon
themselves
by
contumacy
to
holy
call
my
secretary

valiant
and
honorable
and
illustrious
knight

morcar
now
with
the
queen
and
with
her
her
manors
you
will
prepare
the
papers
i
am
yours
to
death
said
ivo
to
do
you
justice
i
think
thou
wert
that
already
stay
here
sir
priest
do
you
know
any
man
who
knows
this
torfrida
i
do
majesty
said
ivo
there
is
one
sir
ascelin
a
man
of
gilbert
s
in
the
send
for
this
torfrida
said
william
haunts
pray
heaven
she
have
not
bewitched
your
tut
i
am
too
old
a
campaigner
to
take
much
harm
by
woman
s
sharpshooting
at
fifteen
score
yards
off
beside
a
deep
stream
between
no
the
woman
has
courage
and
beauty
too
you
say
what
of
that
o
prince
said
the
italian
who
more
beautiful
if
report
be
true
than
those
lost
women
who
dance
nightly
in
the
forests
with
venus
and
herodias
as
it
may
be
this
torfrida
has
done
many
a
time
you
priests
are
apt
to
be
hard
upon
poor
the
fox
found
that
the
grapes
were
sour
said
the
italian
laughing
at
himself
and
his
cloth
or
at
anything
else
by
which
he
could
curry
favor
and
this
woman
was
no
vulgar
witch
that
sort
of
personage
suits
taillebois
s
taste
rather
than
hereward
hungry
dogs
eat
dirty
pudding
said
ivo
pertinently
the
woman
believed
herself
in
the
right
she
believed
that
the
saints
of
heaven
were
on
her
side
i
saw
it
in
her
attitude
in
her
gestures
perhaps
she
was
sire
said
both
in
astonishment
i
would
fain
see
that
woman
and
see
her
husband
too
they
are
folks
after
my
own
heart
i
would
give
them
an
earldom
to
win
i
hope
that
in
that
day
you
will
allow
your
faithful
servant
ivo
to
retire
to
his
ancestral
manors
in
anjou
for
england
will
be
too
hot
for
him
sire
you
know
not
this
man
a
liar
a
bully
a
robber
a
ruffian
who
and
ivo
ran
on
with
furious
invective
after
the
fashion
of
the
normans
who
considered
no
name
too
bad
for
an
english
rebel
sir
ascelin
said
william
as
ascelin
came
in
you
know
hereward
ascelin
bowed
assent
are
these
things
true
which
ivo
alleges
the
lord
taillebois
may
know
best
what
manner
of
man
he
is
since
he
came
into
this
english
air
which
changes
some
folks
mightily
with
a
hardly
disguised
sneer
at
ivo
but
in
flanders
he
was
a
very
perfect
knight
beloved
and
honored
of
all
men
and
especially
of
your
the
great
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
then
no
man
less
i
owe
him
more
than
one
grudge
though
all
in
fair
quarrel
and
one
at
least
which
can
only
be
wiped
out
in
eh
what
ascelin
hesitated
tell
me
sir
thundered
william
unless
you
have
aught
to
be
ashamed
it
is
no
shame
as
far
as
i
know
to
confess
that
i
was
once
a
suitor
as
were
all
knights
for
miles
round
for
the
hand
of
the
once
peerless
torfrida
and
no
shame
to
confess
that
when
hereward
knew
thereof
he
sought
me
out
at
a
tournament
and
served
me
as
he
has
served
many
a
better
man
before
and
since
over
thy
horse
s
croup
eh
said
william
i
am
not
a
bad
horseman
as
all
know
lord
king
but
heaven
save
me
and
all
i
love
from
that
hereward
they
say
he
has
seven
men
s
strength
and
i
verily
can
testify
to
the
truth
that
may
be
by
enchantment
interposed
the
italian
true
sir
priest
this
i
know
that
he
wears
enchanted
armor
which
torfrida
gave
him
before
she
married
enchantments
again
said
the
secretary
tell
me
now
about
torfrida
said
william
ascelin
told
him
all
about
her
not
forgetting
to
say
what
according
to
the
chronicler
was
a
common
report
that
she
had
compassed
hereward
s
love
by
magic
arts
she
used
to
practise
sorcery
he
said
with
her
sorceress
mistress
richilda
of
hainault
all
men
knew
it
arnoul
richilda
s
son
was
as
a
brother
to
her
and
after
old
baldwin
died
and
baldwin
of
mons
and
richilda
came
to
bruges
torfrida
was
always
with
her
while
hereward
was
at
the
wars
the
woman
is
a
manifest
and
notorious
witch
said
the
secretary
it
seems
so
indeed
said
william
with
something
like
a
sigh
and
so
were
torfrida
s
early
follies
visited
on
her
as
all
early
follies
are
but
hereward
you
say
is
a
good
knight
and
true
doubtless
even
when
he
committed
that
great
crime
at
peterborough
for
which
he
and
all
his
are
duly
excommunicated
by
the
bishop
said
the
secretary
he
did
a
very
courteous
and
honorable
and
ascelin
told
how
he
had
saved
alftruda
and
instead
of
putting
her
to
ransom
had
sent
her
safe
to
gilbert
a
very
knightly
deed
he
should
be
rewarded
for
why
not
burn
the
witch
and
reward
him
with
alftruda
instead
since
your
majesty
is
in
so
gracious
a
humor
said
ivo
alftruda
who
is
she
ay
i
recollect
her
young
dolfin
s
wife
why
she
has
a
husband
ay
but
his
holiness
at
rome
can
set
that
right
what
is
there
that
he
can
not
do
there
are
limits
i
fear
even
to
his
power
eh
priest
what
his
holiness
s
powers
as
the
viceroy
of
divinity
on
earth
might
be
did
he
so
choose
it
were
irreverent
to
inquire
but
as
he
condescends
to
use
that
power
only
for
the
good
of
mankind
he
condescends
like
divinity
to
be
bound
by
the
very
laws
which
he
has
promulgated
for
the
benefit
of
his
subjects
and
to
make
himself
only
a
sun
when
he
might
be
a
destructive
he
is
very
kind
and
we
all
owe
him
thanks
said
ivo
who
had
a
confused
notion
that
the
pope
might
strike
him
dead
with
lightning
but
was
enough
not
to
do
so
still
he
might
think
of
this
plan
for
they
say
that
the
lady
is
an
old
friend
of
hereward
s
and
not
over
fond
of
her
scotch
that
i
know
well
said
william
and
beside
if
aught
untoward
should
happen
to
dolfin
and
his
kin
she
might
with
her
broad
lands
be
a
fine
bait
for
hereward
i
see
now
do
this
by
my
command
send
a
trusty
monk
into
ely
let
him
tell
the
monks
that
we
have
determined
to
seize
all
their
outlying
lands
unless
they
surrender
within
the
week
and
let
him
tell
hereward
by
the
faith
and
oath
of
william
of
normandy
that
if
he
will
surrender
himself
to
my
grace
he
shall
have
his
lands
in
bourne
and
a
free
pardon
for
himself
and
all
his
the
men
assented
much
against
their
will
and
went
out
on
their
errand
you
have
played
me
a
scurvy
trick
sir
said
ascelin
in
advising
the
king
to
give
the
lady
alftruda
to
what
did
you
want
her
yourself
on
my
honor
i
knew
not
of
it
but
have
patience
you
shall
have
her
yet
and
all
her
lands
if
you
will
hear
my
counsel
and
keep
but
you
would
give
her
to
hereward
and
to
you
too
it
is
a
poor
bait
say
these
frogs
of
fenmen
that
will
not
take
two
pike
running
listen
to
me
i
must
kill
this
hereward
i
hate
him
i
can
not
eat
my
meat
for
thinking
of
him
kill
him
i
and
so
must
then
we
are
both
agreed
let
us
work
together
and
never
mind
if
one
s
blood
be
old
and
the
other
s
new
i
am
neither
fool
nor
weakly
as
thou
ascelin
could
not
but
assent
then
here
we
must
send
the
king
s
message
but
we
must
add
to
that
is
so
is
war
so
is
eating
drinking
so
is
everything
but
we
must
not
let
hereward
come
in
we
must
drive
him
to
despair
make
the
messenger
add
but
one
word
that
the
king
exempts
from
the
amnesty
torfrida
on
account
of
you
can
put
it
into
more
scholarly
shape
than
i
on
account
of
her
abominable
and
notorious
sorceries
and
demands
that
she
shall
be
given
up
forthwith
to
the
ecclesiastical
power
to
be
judged
as
she
just
so
and
then
for
a
load
of
reeds
out
of
haddenham
heaven
forbid
said
ascelin
who
had
loved
her
once
would
not
perpetual
imprisonment
suffice
what
care
i
that
is
the
churchmen
s
affair
not
ours
but
i
fear
we
shall
not
get
her
even
so
hereward
will
flee
with
her
maybe
escape
to
flanders
or
denmark
he
can
escape
through
a
rat
if
he
will
and
then
we
are
at
peace
i
had
sooner
kill
him
and
have
done
with
it
but
out
of
the
way
he
must
be
so
they
sent
a
monk
in
with
the
message
and
commanded
him
to
tell
the
article
about
the
lady
torfrida
not
only
to
hereward
but
to
the
abbot
and
all
the
monks
a
curt
and
fierce
answer
came
back
not
from
hereward
but
from
torfrida
herself
that
william
of
normandy
was
no
knight
himself
or
he
would
not
offer
a
knight
his
life
on
condition
of
burning
his
lady
william
swore
horribly
what
is
all
this
about
they
told
him
as
much
as
they
chose
to
tell
him
he
was
very
wroth
who
was
ivo
taillebois
to
add
to
his
message
he
had
said
that
torfrida
should
not
taillebois
was
stout
for
he
had
won
the
secretary
over
to
his
side
meanwhile
he
had
said
nothing
about
burning
he
had
merely
supplied
an
oversight
of
the
king
s
the
woman
as
the
secretary
knew
could
not
with
all
deference
to
his
majesty
be
included
in
an
amnesty
she
was
liable
to
ecclesiastical
censure
and
the
ecclesiastical
courts
william
might
exercise
his
influence
on
them
in
all
lawful
ways
and
more
remit
her
sentence
even
so
far
as
to
pardon
her
entirely
if
his
merciful
temper
should
so
incline
him
but
meanwhile
what
better
could
he
ivo
have
done
than
to
remind
the
monks
of
ely
that
she
was
a
sorceress
that
she
had
committed
grave
crimes
and
was
liable
to
punishment
herself
and
they
to
punishment
also
as
her
shelterers
and
accomplices
what
he
wanted
was
to
bring
over
the
monks
and
he
believed
that
message
had
been
a
good
stroke
toward
that
as
for
hereward
the
king
need
not
think
of
him
he
never
would
come
in
alive
he
had
sworn
an
oath
and
he
would
keep
it
and
so
the
matter
ended
chapter
xxxiii
how
the
monks
of
ely
did
after
their
kind
william
s
bolt
or
rather
inextinguishable
greek
fire
could
not
have
fallen
into
ely
at
a
more
propitious
moment
hereward
was
away
with
a
large
body
of
men
and
many
ships
foraging
in
the
northeastern
fens
he
might
not
be
back
for
a
week
abbot
thurstan
for
what
cause
is
not
said
had
lost
heart
a
little
while
before
and
fled
to
angerhale
taking
with
him
the
ornaments
and
treasure
of
the
hereward
had
discovered
his
flight
with
deadly
fear
but
provisions
he
must
have
and
forth
he
must
go
leaving
ely
in
charge
of
half
a
dozen
independent
english
gentlemen
each
of
whom
would
needs
have
his
own
way
just
because
it
was
his
own
only
torfrida
he
took
and
put
her
hand
into
the
hand
of
ranald
sigtrygsson
and
said
thou
true
comrade
and
perfect
knight
as
i
did
by
thy
wife
do
thou
by
mine
if
aught
and
ranald
swore
first
by
the
white
christ
and
then
by
the
head
of
sleipnir
odin
s
horse
that
he
would
stand
by
torfrida
till
the
last
and
then
if
need
was
slay
her
you
will
not
need
king
ranald
i
can
slay
myself
said
she
as
she
took
the
s
hard
honest
hand
and
hereward
went
seemingly
by
mepal
or
sutton
then
came
the
message
and
all
men
in
ely
knew
it
torfrida
stormed
down
to
the
monks
in
honest
indignation
to
demand
that
they
should
send
to
william
and
purge
her
of
the
calumny
she
found
the
barred
and
bolted
they
were
all
gabbling
inside
like
starlings
on
a
foggy
morning
and
would
not
let
her
in
she
hurried
back
to
ranald
fearing
treason
and
foreseeing
the
effect
of
the
message
upon
the
monks
but
what
could
ranald
do
to
find
out
their
counsels
was
impossible
for
him
or
any
man
in
ely
for
the
monks
could
talk
latin
and
the
men
could
not
torfrida
alone
knew
the
sacred
tongue
if
torfrida
could
but
listen
at
the
keyhole
well
all
was
fair
in
war
and
to
the
door
she
went
guarded
by
ranald
and
some
of
his
housecarles
and
listened
with
a
beating
heart
she
heard
words
now
incomprehensible
that
men
who
most
of
them
lived
no
better
than
their
own
serfs
who
could
have
no
amount
of
wealth
not
even
the
hope
of
leaving
that
wealth
to
their
children
should
cling
to
wealth
struggle
forge
lie
do
anything
for
wealth
to
be
used
almost
entirely
not
for
themselves
but
for
the
honor
and
glory
of
the
convent
indicates
an
intensity
of
corporate
feeling
unknown
in
the
outer
world
then
or
now
the
monastery
would
be
ruined
without
this
manor
without
that
wood
without
that
stone
quarry
that
fishery
what
would
become
of
them
but
mingled
with
those
words
were
other
words
unfortunately
more
intelligible
to
this
day
those
of
superstition
what
would
etheldreda
say
how
dare
they
provoke
her
wrath
would
she
submit
to
lose
her
lands
she
might
do
what
might
she
not
do
her
bones
would
refuse
ever
to
work
a
miracle
again
they
had
been
but
too
slack
in
for
many
years
she
might
strike
the
isle
with
barrenness
the
minster
with
lightning
she
might
send
a
flood
up
the
fens
she
might
william
the
norman
to
do
them
justice
those
valiant
monks
feared
not
for
he
was
man
and
could
but
kill
the
body
but
etheldreda
a
virgin
goddess
with
all
the
host
of
heaven
to
back
her
might
she
not
by
intercession
with
powers
still
higher
than
her
own
destroy
both
body
and
soul
in
hell
we
are
betrayed
they
are
going
to
send
for
the
abbot
from
angerhale
said
torfrida
at
last
reeling
from
the
door
all
is
shall
we
burst
open
the
door
and
kill
them
all
asked
ranald
simply
no
king
no
they
are
god
s
men
and
we
have
blood
enough
on
our
we
can
keep
the
gates
lest
any
go
out
to
the
impossible
they
know
the
isle
better
than
we
and
have
a
thousand
so
all
they
could
do
was
to
wait
in
fear
and
trembling
for
hereward
s
return
and
send
martin
lightfoot
off
to
warn
him
wherever
he
might
be
the
monks
remained
perfectly
quiet
the
organ
droned
the
chants
wailed
as
usual
nothing
interrupted
the
stated
order
of
the
services
and
in
the
hall
each
day
they
met
the
knights
as
cheerfully
as
ever
greed
and
superstition
had
made
cowards
of
them
and
now
traitors
it
was
whispered
that
abbot
thurstan
had
returned
to
the
minster
but
no
man
saw
him
and
so
three
or
four
days
went
on
martin
found
hereward
after
incredible
labors
and
told
him
all
clearly
and
shrewdly
the
man
s
manifest
insanity
only
seemed
to
quicken
his
wit
and
increase
his
powers
of
bodily
endurance
hereward
was
already
on
his
way
home
and
never
did
he
and
his
good
men
row
harder
than
they
rowed
that
day
back
to
sutton
he
landed
and
hurried
on
with
half
his
men
leaving
the
rest
to
disembark
the
booty
he
was
anxious
as
to
the
temper
of
the
monks
he
foresaw
all
that
torfrida
had
foreseen
and
as
for
torfrida
herself
he
was
half
mad
ivo
taillebois
s
addition
to
william
s
message
had
had
its
due
effect
he
vowed
even
deadlier
hate
against
the
norman
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
he
ascended
the
heights
to
sutton
it
was
his
shortest
way
to
ely
he
could
not
see
aldreth
from
thence
but
he
could
see
willingham
field
and
belsar
s
hills
round
the
corner
of
haddenham
hill
the
sun
was
setting
long
before
they
reached
ely
but
just
as
he
sank
into
the
western
fen
winter
stopped
pointing
was
that
the
flash
of
arms
there
far
away
just
below
willingham
town
or
was
it
the
setting
sun
upon
the
ripple
of
some
long
water
there
is
not
wind
enough
for
such
a
ripple
said
one
but
ere
they
could
satisfy
themselves
the
sun
was
down
and
all
the
fen
was
gray
hereward
was
still
more
uneasy
if
that
had
been
the
flash
of
arms
it
must
have
come
off
a
very
large
body
of
men
moving
in
column
and
on
the
old
straight
road
between
cambridge
and
ely
he
hastened
on
his
men
but
ere
they
were
within
sight
of
the
they
were
aware
of
a
horse
galloping
violently
towards
them
through
the
dusk
hereward
called
a
halt
he
heard
his
own
heart
beat
as
he
stopped
the
horse
was
pulled
up
short
among
them
and
a
lad
threw
himself
off
hereward
thank
god
i
am
in
time
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
torfrida
treason
she
gasped
i
knew
the
french
are
in
the
island
they
have
got
aldreth
the
whole
army
is
marching
from
cambridge
the
whole
fleet
is
coming
up
from
southrey
and
you
have
time
to
burn
ely
over
the
monks
heads
men
get
bogwood
out
of
yon
cottage
make
yourselves
torches
and
onward
then
rose
a
babel
of
questions
which
torfrida
answered
as
she
could
but
she
had
nothing
to
tell
clerks
cunning
she
said
bitterly
was
an
overmatch
for
woman
s
she
had
sent
out
a
spy
but
he
had
not
returned
till
an
hour
since
then
he
came
back
breathless
with
the
news
that
the
french
army
was
on
the
march
from
cambridge
and
that
as
he
came
over
the
water
at
alrech
he
found
a
party
of
french
knights
in
the
fort
on
the
ely
side
talking
peaceably
with
the
monks
on
guard
she
had
run
up
to
the
borough
hill
which
men
call
cherry
hill
at
this
day
and
one
look
to
the
northeast
had
shown
her
the
river
swarming
with
ships
she
had
rushed
home
put
on
men
s
clothes
hid
a
few
jewels
in
her
bosom
saddled
swallow
and
ridden
for
her
life
thither
and
king
ranald
he
and
his
men
had
gone
desperately
out
towards
haddenham
with
what
english
they
could
muster
but
all
were
in
confusion
some
were
getting
the
women
and
children
into
boats
to
hide
them
in
the
reeds
others
battering
the
minster
gates
vowing
vengeance
on
the
monks
then
ranald
will
be
cut
off
alas
for
the
day
that
ever
brought
his
brave
heart
hither
and
when
the
men
heard
that
a
yell
of
fury
and
despair
burst
from
all
throats
should
they
go
back
to
their
boats
no
onward
cried
hereward
revenge
first
and
safety
after
let
us
leave
nothing
for
the
accursed
frenchmen
but
smoking
ruins
and
then
gather
our
comrades
and
cut
our
way
back
to
the
good
counsel
cried
winter
we
know
the
roads
and
they
do
not
and
in
such
a
dark
night
as
is
coming
we
can
march
out
of
the
island
without
their
being
able
to
follow
us
a
they
hurried
on
but
stopped
once
more
at
the
galloping
of
another
horse
who
comes

or
foe
alwyn
son
of
orgar
cried
a
voice
under
breath
don

make
such
a
noise

within
half
a
mile
of
then
one
traitor

cried
hereward
seizing
him
by
the
throat
for
heaven

cried
torfrida
seizing
his
arm
you
know
not
what
he
may
have
to
i
am
no
traitor
hereward
i
have
fought
by
your
side
as
well
as
the
best
and
if
any
but
you
had
called
alwyn
a
curse
on
your
boasting
tell
us
the
the
abbot
has
made
peace
with
the
king
he
would
give
up
the
island
and
etheldreda
should
keep
all
her
lands
and
honors
i
said
what
i
could
but
who
was
i
to
resist
the
whole
chapter
could
i
alone
brave
etheldreda
s
wrath
alwyn
the
valiant
afraid
of
a
dead
girl
blaspheme
not
hereward
she
may
hear
you
at
this
moment
look
there
and
pointing
up
the
monk
cowered
in
terror
as
a
meteor
flashed
through
the
sky
that
is
etheldreda
shooting
at
us
eh
then
all
i
can
say
is
she
is
a
very
bad
marksman
and
the
french
are
in
the
island
they
then
forward
men
for
one
s
pleasure
and
then
to
die
like
on
cried
alwyn
you
can
not
go
on
the
king
is
at
whichford
at
this
moment
with
all
his
army
half
a
mile
off
right
across
the
road
to
ely
hereward
grew
berserk
on
men
shouted
he
we
shall
kill
a
few
frenchmen
apiece
before
we
die
hereward
cried
torfrida
you
shall
not
go
on
if
you
go
i
shall
be
taken
and
if
i
am
taken
i
shall
be
burned
and
i
can
not

i
can
not
i
shall
go
mad
with
terror
before
i
come
to
the
stake
i
can
not
go
stript
to
my
smock
before
those
frenchmen
i
can
not
be
roasted
piecemeal
hereward
take
me
away
take
me
away
or
kill
me
now
and
here
he
paused
he
had
never
seen
torfrida
thus
overcome
let
us
flee
the
stars
are
against
us
god
is
against
us
let
us
hide
escape
abroad
beg
our
bread
go
on
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
together
for
together
it
must
be
always
but
take
me
away
we
will
go
back
to
the
boats
men
said
hereward
but
they
did
not
go
they
stood
there
irresolute
looking
towards
ely
the
sky
was
pitchy
dark
the
minster
roofs
lying
northeast
were
utterly
invisible
against
the
blackness
we
may
at
least
save
some
who
escape
out
said
hereward
march
on
quickly
to
the
left
under
the
hill
to
the
they
did
so
lie
down
men
there
are
the
french
close
on
our
right
down
among
the
and
they
heard
the
heavy
tramp
of
men
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
cover
the
mare
s
eyes
and
hold
her
mouth
lest
she
neigh
said
winter
hereward
and
torfrida
lay
side
by
side
upon
the
heath
she
was
shivering
with
cold
and
horror
he
laid
his
cloak
over
her
put
his
arm
round
her
your
stars
did
not
foretell
you
this
he
spoke
not
bitterly
but
in
utter
sadness
she
burst
into
an
agony
of
weeping
my
stars
at
least
foretold
me
nothing
but
woe
since
first
i
saw
your
why
did
you
marry
me
then
asked
he
half
angrily
because
i
loved
you
because
i
love
you
then
you
do
not
regret
never
never
never
i
am
quite
happy
quite
happy
why
not
a
low
murmur
from
the
men
made
them
look
up
they
were
near
enough
to
the
town
to
hear
only
too
much
they
heard
the
tramp
of
men
shouts
and
yells
then
the
shrill
cries
of
women
all
dull
and
muffled
the
sounds
came
to
them
through
the
still
night
and
they
lay
there
as
in
a
nightmare
as
men
assisting
at
some
horrible
tragedy
which
they
had
no
power
to
prevent
then
there
was
a
glare
and
a
wisp
of
smoke
against
the
black
sky
and
then
a
house
began
burning
brightly
and
then
another
this
is
the
frenchman
s
faith
and
all
the
while
as
the
sack
raged
in
the
town
below
the
minster
stood
above
dark
silent
and
safe
the
church
had
provided
for
herself
by
sacrificing
the
children
beneath
her
fostering
shadow
they
waited
nearly
an
hour
but
no
fugitives
came
out
come
men
said
hereward
wearily
we
may
as
well
to
the
and
so
they
went
walking
on
like
men
in
a
dream
as
yet
too
stunned
to
realize
to
themselves
the
hopeless
horror
of
their
situation
only
hereward
and
torfrida
saw
it
all
looking
back
on
the
splendid
past
the
splendid
hopes
for
the
future
glory
honor
an
earldom
a
free
danish
england
and
this
was
all
that
was
left
no
it
is
not
cried
torfrida
suddenly
as
if
answering
her
own
unspoken
thoughts
and
his
love
is
still
left
the
gallows
and
the
stake
can
not
take
that
and
she
clung
closer
to
her
husband
s
side
and
he
again
to
hers
they
reached
the
shore
and
told
their
tale
to
their
comrades
whither
now
to
well
to
the
wide
mere
said
hereward
but
their
ships
will
hunt
us
out
we
shall
need
no
hunting
we
must
pick
up
the
men
at
cissham
you
would
not
leave
them
to
be
murdered
too
as
we
have
left
the
ely
men
no
they
would
go
to
well
and
then
the
bruneswald
and
the
merry
greenwood
said
hereward
hey
for
the
merry
greenwood
shouted
leofric
the
deacon
and
the
men
in
the
sudden
delight
of
finding
any
place
any
purpose
answered
with
a
lusty
cheer
brave
hearts
said
hereward
we
will
live
and
die
together
like
we
will
we
will
where
shall
we
stow
the
mare
asked
geri
the
boats
are
full
leave
her
to
me
on
board
he
got
on
board
last
leading
the
mare
by
the
bridle
swim
good
lass
said
he
as
they
pushed
off
and
the
good
lass
who
had
done
it
many
a
time
before
waded
in
and
was
soon
swimming
behind
hereward
turned
and
bent
over
the
side
in
the
darkness
there
was
a
strange
gurgle
a
splash
and
a
swirl
he
turned
round
and
sat
upright
again
they
rowed
on
that
mare
will
never
swim
all
the
way
to
well
said
one
she
will
not
need
it
said
hereward
why
cried
torfrida
feeling
in
the
darkness
she
is
loose
what
is
this
in
your
hand
your
dagger
and
wet
mare
swallow
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
reach
we
could
never
have
got
her
to
and
you
have
cried
a
dozen
voices
do
you
think
that
i
would
let
a
cursed
frenchman
ay
even
william
s
self
say
that
he
had
bestridden
hereward
s
mare
none
answered
but
torfrida
as
she
laid
her
head
upon
her
husband
s
bosom
felt
the
great
tears
running
down
from
his
cheek
on
to
her
own
none
spoke
a
word
the
men
were
there
was
something
despairing
and
in
the
deed
and
yet
there
was
a
savage
grandeur
in
it
which
bound
their
savage
hearts
still
closer
to
their
chief
and
so
mare
swallow
s
bones
lie
somewhere
in
the
peat
unto
this
day
they
got
to
well
they
sent
out
spies
to
find
the
men
who
had
been
wasting
cissham
with
fire
and
sword
and
at
last
brought
them
in
ill
news
as
usual
had
travelled
fast
they
had
heard
of
the
fall
of
ely
and
hidden
themselves
in
a
certain
very
small
island
which
is
called
stimtench
where
thinking
that
the
friends
in
search
of
them
were
frenchmen
in
pursuit
they
hid
themselves
among
the
high
reeds
there
two
of
them
one
starkwolf
by
name
the
other
broher
hiding
near
each
other
thought
that
as
they
were
monks
it
might
conduce
to
their
safety
if
they
had
shaven
crowns
and
set
to
work
with
their
swords
to
shave
each
other
s
heads
as
well
as
they
could
but
at
last
by
their
and
their
speech
recognizing
each
other
they
left
off
fighting
and
went
after
hereward
so
jokes
grimly
enough
leofric
the
deacon
who
must
have
seen
them
come
in
the
next
morning
with
bleeding
coxcombs
and
could
laugh
over
the
thing
in
after
years
but
he
was
in
no
humor
for
jesting
in
the
days
in
which
they
lay
at
well
nor
was
he
in
jesting
humor
when
a
week
afterwards
hunted
by
the
normans
from
well
and
forced
too
take
to
meres
and
waterways
known
only
to
them
and
too
shallow
and
narrow
for
the
norman
ships
they
found
their
way
across
into
the
old
nene
and
so
by
thorney
on
toward
crowland
leaving
peterborough
far
on
the
left
for
as
they
neared
crowland
they
saw
before
them
rowing
slowly
a
barge
full
of
men
and
as
they
neared
that
barge
behold
all
they
who
rowed
were
blind
of
both
their
eyes
and
all
they
who
sat
and
guided
them
were
maimed
of
both
their
hands
and
as
they
came
alongside
there
was
not
a
man
in
all
that
ghastly
crew
but
was
an
ancient
friend
by
whose
side
they
had
fought
full
many
a
day
and
with
whom
they
had
drunk
deep
full
many
a
night
they
were
the
of
william
s
vengeance
thrust
into
that
boat
to
tell
the
rest
of
the
what
those
had
to
expect
who
dared
oppose
the
norman
and
they
were
going
by
some
to
crowland
to
the
sanctuary
of
the
danish
that
they
might
cast
themselves
down
before
guthlac
and
ask
of
him
that
mercy
for
their
souls
which
the
conqueror
had
denied
to
their
bodies
alas
for
them
they
were
but
a
handful
among
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
mutilated
cripples
who
swarmed
all
over
england
and
especially
in
the
north
and
east
throughout
the
reign
of
the
norman
conquerors
they
told
their
comrades
fate
slaughtered
in
the
first
attack
or
hanged
afterwards
as
rebels
and
traitors
to
a
foreigner
whom
they
had
never
seen
and
to
whom
they
owed
no
fealty
by
law
of
god
or
man
and
ranald
sigtrygsson
none
knew
aught
of
him
he
never
got
home
again
to
his
irish
princess
and
the
poor
women
asked
torfrida
but
she
received
no
answer
and
the
men
swore
a
great
oath
and
kept
it
never
to
give
quarter
to
a
norman
as
long
as
there
was
one
left
on
english
ground
neither
were
the
monks
of
ely
in
jesting
humor
when
they
came
to
count
up
the
price
of
their
own
baseness
they
had
as
was
in
that
day
the
cant
of
all
cowardly
english
churchmen
as
well
as
of
the
more
crafty
normans
obeyed
the
apostolic
injunction
to
submit
to
the
powers
that
be
because
they
are
ordained
but
they
found
the
hand
of
the
powers
that
be
a
very
heavy
one
forty
knights
were
billeted
on
them
at
free
quarters
with
all
their
men
every
morning
the
butler
had
to
distribute
to
them
food
and
pay
in
the
great
hall
and
in
vain
were
their
complaints
of
bad
faith
william
meanwhile
who
loved
money
as
well
as
he
loved
the
tall
deer
had
had
another
says
marks
of
them
as
the
price
of
their
church
s
safety
for
the
payment
whereof
if
one
authority
is
to
be
trusted
they
sold
all
the
furniture
of
gold
and
silver
crosses
altars
coffers
covers
chalices
platters
ewers
urnets
basons
cups
and
nay
the
idols
themselves
were
not
spared
for
beside
that
they
sold
a
goodly
image
of
our
lady
with
her
little
son
in
a
throne
wrought
with
marvellous
workmanship
which
elsegus
the
abbot
had
made
likewise
they
stripped
many
images
of
holy
virgins
of
much
furniture
of
gold
and
footnote
these
details
are
from
a
story
found
in
the
isle
of
ely
published
by
giles
it
seems
a
late
composition
probably
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
has
manifest
errors
of
fact
but
so
that
poor
etheldreda
had
no
finery
in
which
to
appear
on
festivals
and
went
in
russet
for
many
years
after
the
which
money
according
to
another
footnote
stow
s
they
took
as
they
had
promised
to
picot
the
viscount
at
cambridge
he
weighed
the
money
and
finding
it
an
ounce
short
accused
them
of
cheating
the
king
and
sentenced
them
to
pay
marks
more
after
which
the
royal
commissioners
came
plundered
the
abbey
of
all
that
was
left
and
took
away
likewise
a
great
mass
of
gold
and
silver
found
in
wentworth
wherewith
the
brethren
meant
to
repair
the
altar
vessels
and
also
a
notable

died
in
a
few
months
egelwin
the
bishop
of
durham
was
taken
in
the
abbey
he
was
a
bishop
and
they
dared
not
kill
him
but
he
was
a
patriot
and
must
have
no
mercy
they
accused
him
of
stealing
the
treasures
of
durham
which
he
had
brought
to
ely
for
the
service
of
his
country
and
shut
him

a

months
after
the
brave
man
was
found
starved
and
dead
whether
of
his

and
so
ended

we

not

coaxed

at
times
to

they
got
their
grace
of
the

and
entered
the
king
s
service
but
the
craving
after
the
greenwood
was
upon
them
they
dreaded
and
hated
the
four
stone
walls
of
a
norman
castle
and
like

slipt
back
to
the
forest

gradually
too

rose
among

lawless
as
they
were
the
instinct
of
discipline
and
side
by
side
with
that
of
personal
independence
which
is
the
peculiar
mark
and
peculiar
strength
of
the
english
character
who
knows
not
how
in
the
lytell

of

shot
at
the

this
was
the
old
outlaw
spirit
which
has
descended
to
their
inlawed
descendants
and
makes
to
this
day
the
life
and
marrow
of
an
english
public
school
one
fixed
idea
the
outlaw
had
hatred
of
the
invader
if
his
herde
were
the
king
s
deer
his
treasure
was
the
earl
s
purse
and
still
oftener
the
purse
of
the
foreign
churchman
norman
or
italian
who
had
expelled
the
outlaw
s
english
cousins
from
their
convents
shamefully
scourged
and
cruelly
imprisoned
them
as
the
blessed
archbishop
lanfranc
did
at
canterbury
because
they
would
not
own
allegiance
to
a
french
abbot
or
murdered
them
at
the
high
altar
as
did
the
new
abbot
of
glastonbury
because
they
would
not
change
their
old
gregorian
chant
for
that
of
william
of
fécamp
footnote
see
the
chronicle
on
these
mitred
tyrants
the
outlaw
had
no
mercy
as
far
as
their
purses
were
concerned
their
persons
as
consecrated
were
even
to
him
sacred
and
inviolable
at

from
wounds
and
death
and
one
may
suppose

that

even
so
it
was
with
hereward
in
the
bruneswald
if
the
old
chroniclers
leofric
especially
are
to
be
believed
and
now
torfrida
was
astonished
she
had
given
way
utterly
at
ely
from
woman
s
fear
and
woman
s
disappointment
all
was
over
all
was
lost
what
was
left
save
to
die
but
and
it
was
a
new
and
unexpected
fact
to
one
of
her
excitable
southern
blood
easily
raised
and
easily
depressed
she
discovered
that
neither
her
husband
nor
winter
nor
geri
nor
wenoch
nor
ranald
of
ramsey
nor
even
the
romancing
harping
leofric
thought
that
all
was
lost
she
argued
it
with
them
not
to
persuade
them
into
base
submission
but
to
satisfy
her
own
surprise
but
what
will
you
do
live
in
the
and
what
then
burn
every
town
which
a
frenchman
holds
and
kill
every
frenchman
we
but
what
plan
have
you
who
wants
a
plan
as
you
call
it
while
he
has
the
green
hollies
overhead
the
dun
deer
on
the
lawn
bow
in
his
hand
and
sword
by
his
side
but
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
all
we
shall
live
till
we
but
william
is
master
of
all
what
is
that
to
us
he
is
not
our
but
he
must
be
some
day
you
will
grow
fewer
and
fewer
his
government
will
grow
stronger
and
what
is
that
to
us
when
we
are
dead
there
will
be
brave
yeomen
in
plenty
to
take
our
place
you
would
not
turn
traitor
i
never
never
i
will
live
and
die
with
you
in
your
greenwood
as
you
call
it
only
i
did
not
understand
you
torfrida
did
not
she
was
discovering
the
fact
which
her
nation
have
more
than
once
discovered
since
that
the
stupid
valor
of
the
englishman
never
knows
when
it
is
beaten
and
sometimes
by
that
ignorance
succeeds
in
not
being
beaten
after
all
so
hereward

the

led

hunted

the

swarming
with
pheasant
roe

and
more
wolves
than
were

broken
glades

the

came
out
from

for

evening
graze
and
the
partridges
and

whirred
up
and
the

loped
away
innumerable
and
where
hollies

always
gave

need

whose

were

they
were

and
why
not
the

had
once
been
theirs
the

and
if
godric
of

slew
the
irnham
deer
burned
irnham

over
the
head
of
the
new
norman
lord
and
thought
no
harm
he
did
but
what
he
would
with
that
which
had
been
once
his
own
easy
it
was
to
dash
out
by
night
and
make
a
raid
to
harry
the
places
which
they
once
had
owned
themselves
in
the
vale
of
belvoir
to
the
west
or
to
the
east
in
the
strip
of
fertile
land

that
the

had
left

the
said

or
turketil
misspelt
by
frenchmen
and
sweyn
and
many
a
good
man
more
for
ivo
s
possessions
were
enormous
were
thorns
in
the
sides
of
ivo
and
his
men
which
must
be
extracted
and
the
bruneswald
a
nest
of
hornets
which
must
be
smoked
out
at
any
cost
wherefore
it
befell
that
once
upon
a
day
there
came
riding
to
hereward
in
the
bruneswald
a
horseman
all
alone
and
meeting
with
hereward
and
his
men
he
made
signs
of
amity
and
bowed
himself
low
and
pulled
out
of
his
purse
a
letter
protesting
that
he
was
an
englishman
and
a
good
felawe
and
that
though
he
came
from
lincoln
town
a
friend
to
the
english
had
sent
him
that
was
believable
enough
for
hereward
had
his
friends
and
his
spies
far
and
wide
and
when
he
opened
the
letter
and
looked
first
like
a
wary
man
at
the
signature
a
sudden
thrill
went
through
him
it
was
alftruda
s
if
he
was
interested
in
her
considering
what
had
passed
between
them
from
her
childhood
it
was
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
yet
somehow
he
felt
ashamed
of
that
same
sudden
thrill
and
hereward
had
reason
to
be
ashamed
he
had
been
faithful
to
torfrida
a
virtue
most
rare
in
those
days
few
were
faithful
then
save
it
may
be
baldwin
of
mons
to
his
tyrant
and
idol
the
sorceress
richilda
and
william
of
normandy
whatever
were
his
other
sins
to
his
wise
and
sweet
and
beautiful
matilda
the
stories
of
his
coldness
and
cruelty
to
her
seem
to
rest
on
no
foundation
one
need
believe
them
as
little
as
one
does
the
myth
of
one
chronicler
that
when
she
tried
to
stop
him
from
some
expedition
and
clung
to
him
as
he
sat
upon
his
horse
he
smote
his
spur
so
deep
into
her
breast
that
she
fell
dead
the
man
had
and
feared
god
in
his
own
wild
way
therefore
it
was
perhaps
that
he
conquered
and
hereward
had
been
faithful
likewise
to
torfrida
and
loved
her
with
an
overwhelming
adoration
as
all
true
men
love
and
for
that
very
reason
he
was
the
more
aware
that
his
feeling
for
alftruda
was
strangely
like
his
feeling
for
torfrida
and
yet
strangely
different
there
was
nothing
in
the
letter
that
he
should
not
have
read
she
called
him
her
best
and
dearest
friend
twice
the
savior
of
her
life
what
could
she
do
in
return
but
at
any
risk
to
herself
try
and
save
his
life
the
french

the

thereof
just
now
is
the
pious
and
loyal
waltheof
as
he
is
of
huntingdon
and
cambridge
is
he
going
to
join
young
from
warwick
and
leicester
to
root
out
the
last
englishman
why
not
that
would
be
a
deed
worthy
of
the
man
who
married
judith
and
believes
in
the
powers
that
be
and
eats
dirt
daily
at
william
s
then
he
read
on
ascelin
had
been
mentioned
he
remarked
three
or
four
times
in
the
letter
which
was
long
as
from
one
lingering
over
the
paper
wishing
to
say
more
than
she
dared
at
the
end
was
a
hint
of
the
reason
o
that
having
saved
me
twice
you
could
save
me
once
more
know
you
that
gospatrick
has
been
driven
from
his
earldom
on
charge
of
treason
and
that
waltheof
has
northumbria
in
his
place
as
well
as
the
parts
round
you
and
that
gospatrick
is
fled
to
scotland
again
with
his
sons
my
man
among
them
and
now
the
report
comes
that
my
man
is
slain
in
battle
on
the
border
and
that
i
am
to
be
given
away
as
i
have
been
given
away
twice
before
to
ascelin
this
i
know
as
i
know
all
not
only
from
him
of
ghent
but
from
him
of
peterborough
ascelin
s
hereward
laughed
a
laugh
of
cynical
triumph
pardonable
enough
in
a
broken
man
gospatrick
the
wittol
the
woodcock
looking
at
the
springe
and
then
coolly
putting
his
head
therein
throwing
the
hatchet
after
the
helve
selling
his
soul
and
never
getting
the
price
of
it
i
foresaw
it
foretold
it
i
believe
to
alftruda
herself
foretold
that
he
would
not
keep
his
bought
earldom
three
years
what
a
people
we
are
we
english
if
gospatrick
is
as
he
is
the
shrewdest
man
among
us
with
a
dash
of
canny
scots
blood
too
among
the
the
blind
is
king
says
torfrida
out
of
her
wise
ancients
and
blind
we
are
if
he
is
our
best
no
there
is
one
better
man
left
i
trust
one
that
will
never
be
fool
enough
to
put
his
head
into
the
wolf
s
mouth
and
trust
the
norman
and
that
is
hereward
the
and
hereward
boasted
to
himself
at
gospatrick
s
expense
of
his
own
superior
wisdom
till
his
eye
caught
a
line
or
two
which
finished
the
letter
o
that
you
would
change
your
mind
much
as
i
honor
you
for
it
o
that
you
would
come
in
to
the
king
who
loves
and
trusts
you
having
seen
your
constancy
and
faith
proved
by
so
many
years
of
affliction
great
things
are
open
to
you
and
great
joys
i
dare
not
tell
you
what
but
i
know
them
if
you
would
come
in
you
to
waste
yourself
in
the
forest
an
outlaw
and
a
savage
opportunity
once
lost
never
returns
time
flies
fast
hereward
my
friend
and
we
shall
all
grow
old
i
think
at
times
that
i
shall
soon
grow
old
and
the
joys
of
life
will
be
impossible
and
nothing
left
but
vain
hey
said
hereward
a
very
clerkly
letter
i
did
not
think
she
was
so
good
a
scholar
almost
as
good
a
one
as
that
was
all
he
said
and
as
for
thinking
he
had
the
of
seven
counties
to
think
of
but
what
could
those
great
fortunes
and
joys
be
which
alftruda
did
not
dare
to
describe
she
growing
old
too
impossible
that
was
woman
s
vanity
it
was
but
two
years
since
she
was
as
fair
as
a
saint
in
a
window
she
shall
not
marry
ascelin
i
will
cut
his
head
off
she
shall
have
her
own
choice
for
once
poor
and
hereward
found
himself
worked
up
to
a
great
height
of
paternal
solicitude
for
alftruda
and
righteous
indignation
against
ascelin
he
did
not
confess
to
himself
that
he
disliked
much
in
his
selfish
vanity
the
notion
of
alftruda
s
marrying
any
one
at
all
he
did
not
want
to
marry
her
himself
of
course
not
but
there
is
no
dog
in
the
manger
so
churlish
on
such
points
as
a
vain
man
there
are
those
who
will
not
willingly
let
their
own
sisters
their
own
daughters
their
own
servants
marry
why
should
a
woman
wish
to
marry
any
one
but
them
but
hereward
however
vain
was
no
dreamer
or
sluggard
he
set
to
work
joyfully
cheerfully
scenting
battle
afar
off
like
job
s
and
pawing
for
the
battle
he
sent
back
alftruda
s
messenger
with
this
answer
tell
your
lady
that
i
kiss
her
hands
and
feet
that
i
can
not
write
for
outlaws
carry
no
pen
and
ink
but
that
what
she
has
commanded
that
will
i
it
is
noteworthy
that
when
hereward
showed
torfrida
which
he
did
frankly
alftruda
s
letter
he
did
not
tell
her
the
exact
words
of
his
answer
and
stumbled
and
varied
much
vexing
her
thereby
when
she
naturally
wished
to
hear
them
word
for
word
then
he
sent
out
spies
to
the
four
airts
of
heaven
and
his
spies
finding
a
friend
and
a
meal
in
every
hovel
brought
home
all
the
news
he
needed
he
withdrew
torfrida
and
his
men
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
no
hint
of
the
place
is
given
by
the
chronicler
cut
down
trees
formed
an
abattis
of
trunks
and
branches
and
awaited
the
enemy
chapter
xxxv
how
abbot
thorold
was
put
to
ransom
though
hereward
had
as
yet
no
feud
against
bysshoppes
and
archbysshoppes
save
egelsin
of
selsey
who
had
excommunicated
him
but
who
was
at
the
other
end
of
england
he
had
feud
as
may
be
supposed
against
thorold
abbot
of
peterborough
and
thorold
feud
likewise
against
him
when
thorold
had
entered
the
golden
borough
hoping
to
fatten
himself
with
all
its
treasures
he
had
found
it
a
smoking
ruin
and
its
treasures
gone
to
ely
to
pay
sweyn
and
his
danes
and
such
a
sacrilege
especially
when
he
was
the
loser
thereby
was
the
unpardonable
sin
itself
in
the
eyes
of
thorold
as
he
hoped
it
might
be
in
the
eyes
of
peter
joyfully
therefore
he
joined
his
friend
ivo
taillebois
when
with
his
usual
pompous
verbosity
saith
peter
of
blois
writing
on
this
very
matter
he
asked
him
to
join
in
destroying
hereward
nevertheless
with
all
the
norman
chivalry
at
their
back
it
behoved
them
to
move
with
caution
for
so
says
the
chronicler
hereward
had
in
these
days
very
many
foreigners
as
well
as
landsfolk
who
had
come
to
him
to
practise
and
learn
war
and
fled
from
their
masters
and
friends
when
they
heard
of
his
fame
and
some
of
them
the
king
s
courtiers
who
had
come
to
see
whether
those
things
which
they
heard
were
true
whom
hereward
nevertheless
received
cautiously
on
plighted
troth
and
so
ivo
taillebois
summoned
all
his
men
and
all
other
men
s
men
who
would
join
him
and
rode
forth
through
spalding
and
bourne
having
announced
to
lucia
his
bride
that
he
was
going
to
slay
her
one
remaining
relative
and
when
she
wept
cursed
and
kicked
her
as
he
did
once
a
week
after
which
he
came
to
thorold
of
peterborough
so
on
the
two
worthies
rode
from
peterborough
to
stamford
and
from
stamford
into
the
wilderness
no
man
knows
whither
and
far
they
rode
by
bush
and
shaugh
and
far
by
moss
and
mire
but
never
found
a
track
of
hereward
or
his
men
and
ivo
taillebois
left
off
boasting
how
he
would
burn
torfrida
over
a
slow
fire
and
confined
himself
to
cursing
and
abbot
thorold
left
off
warbling
the
song
of
roland
as
if
he
had
been
going
to
a
second
battle
of
hastings
and
wished
himself
in
warm
bed
at
peterborough
but
at
the
last
they
struck
upon
a
great
and
followed
it
at
their
best
pace
for
several
miles
and
yet
no
sign
of
hereward
catch
an
englishman
quoth
the
abbot
but
that
was
not
so
easy
the
poor
folk
had
hidden
themselves
like
israel
of
old
in
thickets
and
dens
and
caves
of
rocks
at
the
sight
of
the
norman
tyrants
and
not
a
living
soul
had
appeared
for
twenty
miles
at
last
they
caught
a
ragged
wretch
herding
swine
and
haled
him
up
to
ivo
have
you
seen
hereward
villain
asked
he
through
an
interpreter
you
lie
these
are
his
fresh
and
you
must
have
seen
him
eh
thrust
out
one
of
his
eyes
and
he
will
find
his
it
was
done
will
you
answer
now
the
poor
wretch
only
howled
thrust
out
the
no
not
that
mercy
i
will
tell
he
is
gone
by
this
four
hours
how
have
you
not
met
him
fool
the
hoofs
point
onward
ay
and
the
fellow
could
hardly
hide
a
grin
but
he
had
shod
all
his
horses
a
storm
of
execration
followed
they
might
be
thrown
twenty
miles
out
of
their
right
road
by
the
stratagem
so
you
had
seen
hereward
and
would
not
tell
put
out
his
other
eye
said
taillebois
as
a
vent
to
his
own
feelings
and
they
turned
their
horses
heads
and
rode
back
leaving
the
man
blind
in
the
forest
the
day
was
waning
now
the
fog
hung
heavy
on
the
treetops
and
dripped
upon
their
heads
the
horses
were
getting
tired
and
slipped
and
stumbled
in
the
deep
clay
paths
the
footmen
were
more
tired
still
and
cold
and
hungry
straggled
more
and
more
the
led
over
an
open
lawn
of
grass
and
fern
with
here
and
there
an
ancient
thorn
and
round
it
on
three
sides
thick
wood
of
oak
and
beech
with
under
copse
of
holly
and
hazel
into
that
wood
the
led
by
a
path
on
which
there
was
but
room
for
one
horse
at
a
time
here
they
are
at
last
cried
ivo
i
see
the
fresh
footmarks
of
men
as
well
as
horses
push
on
knights
and
men
the
abbot
looked
at
the
dark
dripping
wood
and
meditated
i
think
that
it
will
be
as
well
for
some
of
us
to
remain
here
and
spreading
our
men
along
the
woodside
prevent
the
escape
of
the
villains
moi
hommes
d
armes
as
you
like
i
will
go
in
and
bolt
the
rabbit
and
you
shall
snap
him
up
as
he
comes
and
ivo
who
was
as
brave
as
a
thrust
his
horse
into
the
path
while
the
abbot
sat
shivering
outside
certain
nobles
of
higher
rank
says
peter
de
blois
followed
his
example
not
wishing
to
rust
their
armor
or
tear
their
fine
clothes
in
the
dank
the
knights
and
straggled
slowly
into
the
forest
some
by
the
path
some
elsewhere
grumbling
audibly
at
the
black
work
before
them
at
last
the
crashing
of
the
branches
died
away
and
all
was
still
abbot
thorold
sat
there
upon
his
shivering
horse
shivering
himself
as
the
cold
pierced
through
his
wet
mail
and
as
near
an
hour
past
and
no
sign
of
foe
or
friend
appeared
he
cursed
the
hour
in
which
he
took
off
the
beautiful
garments
of
the
sanctuary
to
endure
those
of
the
he
thought
of
a
warm
chamber
warm
bath
warm
footcloths
warm
pheasant
and
warm
wine
he
kicked
his
freezing
iron
feet
in
the
freezing
iron
stirrup
he
tried
to
blow
his
nose
with
his
freezing
iron
hand
but
dropt
his
handkerchief
into
the
mud
and
his
horse
trod
on
it
he
tried
to
warble
the
song
of
roland
but
the
words
exploded
in
a
cough
and
a
sneeze
and
so
dragged
on
the
weary
hours
says
the
chronicler
nearly
all
day
till
the
ninth
hour
but
never
did
they
see
coming
out
of
the
forest
the
men
who
had
gone
in
a
shout
from
his
nephew
sir
ascelin
made
all
turn
their
heads
behind
them
on
the
open
lawn
in
the
throat
between
the
woods
by
which
they
had
entered
were
some
forty
knights
galloping
toward
them
ivo
no
almost
shrieked
the
abbot
there
is
the
banner
it
is
there
is
winter
on
his
left
cried
one
and
there
with
the
standard
is
the
accursed
monk
ranald
of
and
on
they
came
having
debouched
from
the
wood
some
two
hundred
yards
off
behind
a
roll
in
the
lawn
just
far
enough
off
to
charge
as
soon
as
they
were
in
line
on
they
came
two
deep
with
lances
high
over
their
shoulders
heads
and
heels
well
down
while
the
green
tufts
flew
behind
them
moi
hommes
d
armes
shouted
the
abbot
but
too
late
the
french
turned
right
and
left
to
form
was
impossible
ere
the
human
whirlwind
would
be
upon
them
another
and
with
a
shout
of
a
bear
a
bear
the
wake
the
wake
they
were
struck
ridden
through
hurled
over
and
trampled
into
the
mud
i
yield
grace
i
yield
cried
thorold
struggling
from
under
his
horse
but
there
was
no
one
to
whom
to
yield
the
knights
backs
were
fifty
yards
off
their
right
arms
high
in
the
air
striking
and
stabbing
the
battle
was
l
there
was
no
quarter
given
that
day
and
he
that
came
live
out
thereof
was
he
that
ran
the
abbot
tried
to
make
for
the
wood
but
ere
he
could
gain
it
the
knights
had
turned
and
one
rode
straight
at
him
throwing
away
a
broken
lance
and
drawing
his
sword
abbot
thorold
may
not
have
been
the
coward
which
peter
of
blois
would
have
him
over
and
above
being
the
bully
which
all
men
would
have
him
but
if
so
even
a
worm
will
turn
and
so
did
the
abbot
he
drew
sword
from
thigh
got
well
under
his
shield
his
left
foot
forward
and
struck
one
blow
for
his
life
and
at
the
right
place
his
foe
s
bare
knee
but
he
had
to
do
with
a
warier
man
than
himself
there
was
a
quick
jerk
of
the
rein
the
horse
swerved
round
right
upon
him
and
knocked
him
head
over
heels
while
his
blow
went
into
empty
air
yield
or
die
cried
the
knight
leaping
from
his
horse
and
kneeling
on
his
head
i
am
a
man
of
god
an
abbot
churchman
man
of
all
the
devils
and
the
knight
lugged
him
up
and
bound
his
arms
behind
him
with
the
abbot
s
own
belt
ahoi
here
i
have
caught
a
fish
i
have
got
the
golden
borough
in
my
purse
roared
he
how
much
has
peter
gained
since
we
borrowed
of
him
last
abbot
he
will
have
to
pay
out
the
silver
pennies
bonnily
if
he
wishes
to
get
back
blaspheme
not
godless
barbarian
whereat
the
knight
kicked
him
and
you

thorold
the
scoundrel

cried
hereward
galloping
up
and
we
have
three
or
four
more
dainty
french
knights
and
a
viscount
of
i
know
not
where
among
them
this
is
a
good
day
s
work
now
for
ivo
and
his
and
the
abbot
with
four
or
five
more
prisoners
were
hoisted
on
to
their
own
horses
tied
firmly
and
led
away
into
the
forest
path
do
not
leave
a
wounded
man
to
die
cried
a
knight
who
lay
on
the
lawn
never
we
i
will
come
back
and
put
you
out
of
your
pain
quoth
some
one
siward
siward

the
knight
in
french
that

thorold

i
wish

company
but
friends

are
and

and
he
dismounted
and
did
his
best
for
the
wounded
man
promising
to
return
and
fetch
him
off
before
night
or
send
yeomen
to
do
so
as
he
pushed
on
through
the
wood
the
abbot
began
to
see
signs
of
a
fight
riderless
horses
crashing
through
the
copse
wounded
men
straggling
back
to
be
cut
down
without
mercy
by
the
english
the
war
had
been
l
for
a
long
while
none
gave
or
asked
quarter
the
knights
might
be
kept
for
ransom
they
had
money
the
wretched
men
of
the
lower
classes
who
had
none
were
slain
as
they
would
have
slain
the
english
soon
they
heard
the
noise
of
battle
and
saw
horsemen
and
footmen
tangled
in
an
abattis
from
behind
which
archers
and
shot
them
down
in
safety
hereward
dashed
forward
with
the
shout
of
torfrida
and
at
that
the
french
taken
in
the
flank
fled
and
were
smitten
as
they
fled
hip
and
thigh
hereward
bade
them
spare
a
fugitive
and
bring
him
to
him
i
give
you
your
life
so
run
and
carry
my
message
that
is
taillebois
s
banner
there
forward
is
it
not
then
go
after
him
and
tell
him
hereward
has
the
abbot
of
burgh
and
half
a
dozen
knights
safe
by
the
heels
and
unless
ivo
clears
the
wood
of
his
men
by
nightfall
i
will
hang
every
one
of
them
up
for
the
crows
before
ivo
got
the
message
and
having
had
enough
fighting
for
the
day
drew
off
says
the
chronicler
for
the
sake
of
the
abbot
and
his
two
hours
after
the
abbot
and
the
other
prisoners
were
sitting
unbound
but
unarmed
in
the
forest
encampment
waiting
for
a
right
good
meal
with
torfrida
bustling
about
them
after
binding
up
the
very
few
wounded
among
their
own
men
every
courtesy
was
shown
them
and
their
hearts
were
lifted
up
as
they
beheld
approaching
among
the
trees
great
caldrons
of
good
soup
forest
salads
red
deer
and
roe
roasted
on
the
wood
embers
spits
of
pheasants
and
partridges
larks
and
buntings
thrust
off
one
by
one
by
fair
hands
into
the
burdock
leaves
which
served
as
platters
and
last
but
not
least
jacks
of
ale
and
wine
appearing
mysteriously
from
a
cool
old
stone
quarry
abbot
thorold
ate
to
his
heart
s
content
complimented
every
one
vowed
he
would
forswear
all
norman
cooks
and
take
to
the
greenwood
himself
and
was
as
gracious
and
courtly
as
if
he
had
been
at
the
new
palace
at
winchester
and
all
the
more
for
this
reason
that
he
had
intended
to
overawe
the
english
barbarians
by
his
polished
norman
manners
he
found
those
of
hereward
and
torfrida
at
least
as
polished
as
his
own
i
am
glad
you
are
content
lord
abbot
said
torfrida
i
trust
you
prefer
dining
with
me
to
burning
me
as
you
meant
to
i
burn
such
peerless
beauty
i
injure
a
form
made
only
for
the
courts
of
kings
heaven
and
all
saints
knighthood
and
all
chivalry
forbid
what
taillebois
may
have
said
i
know
not
i
am
no
more
answerable
for
his
intentions
than
i
am
for
his
parentage
or
his
success
this
day
let
churls
be
churls
and
i
at
least
thanks
to
my
ancestors
am
a
and
as
a
gentleman
will
of
course
contribute
to
the
pleasure
of
your
hosts
it
will
surely
please
you
to
gratify
us
with
one
stave
at
least
of
that
song
which
has
made
your
name
famous
among
all
knights
holding
out
a
harp
i
blush
but
obey
a
harp
in
the
greenwood
a
court
in
the
wilderness
what
joy
and
the
vain
abbot
took
the
harp
and
said
these
if
you
will
allow
my
modesty
to
choose
are
the
staves
on
which
i
especially
pride
myself
the
staves
which
taillefer
you
will
pardon
my
mentioning
him
why
pardon
a
noble
minstrel
he
was
and
a
brave
warrior
though
our
foe
and
often
have
i
longed
to
hear
him
little
thinking
that
i
should
hear
instead
the
maker
so
said
hereward
and
the
abbot
sang
those
wondrous
staves
where
roland
left
alone
of
all
the
paladins
finds
death
come
on
him
fast
and
on
the
pyrenaean
peak
beneath
the
pine
he
lays
himself
his
face
toward
the
ground
and
under
him
his
sword
and
magic
horn
that
charles
his
lord
may
say
and
all
his
folk
the
gentle
count
he
died
a
conqueror
and
then
turns
his
eyes
southward
toward
spain
betakes
himself
to
remember
many
things
of
so
many
lands
which
he
conquered
valiantly
of
pleasant
france
of
the
men
of
his
lineage
of
charlemagne
his
lord
who
brought
him
up
he
could
not
help
to
weep
and
sigh
but
yet
himself
he
would
not
forget
he
bewailed
his
sins
and
prayed
god
s
mercy
true
father
who
ne
er
yet
didst
lie
who
raised
lazarus
from
death
and
guarded
daniel
from
the
lions
guard
my
soul
from
all
perils
for
the
sins
which
in
my
life
i
did
his
right
glove
then
he
offered
to
god
gabriel
took
it
from
his
hand
on
his
arm
the
chief
bowed
down
with
joined
hands
he
went
unto
his
end
god
sent
down
his
angel
cherubim
and
michael
whom
men
call
del
together
with
them
gabriel
he
came
the
soul
of
the
count
they
bore
to
and
the
abbot
ended
sadly
and
gently
without
that
wild
aoi
the
with
which
he
usually
ends
his
staves
and
the
wild
men
of
the
woods
were
softened
and
saddened
by
the
melody
and
as
many
as
understood
french
said
when
he
finished
amen
so
may
all
good
knights
die
thou
art
a
great
maker
abbot
they
told
truths
of
thee
sing
us
more
of
thy
great
and
he
sang
them
the
staves
of
the
olifant
the
magic
horn
how
roland
would
not
sound
it
in
his
pride
and
sounded
it
at
turpin
s
bidding
but
too
late
and
how
his
temples
burst
with
that
great
blast
and
charles
and
all
his
peers
heard
it
through
the
gorges
leagues
away
in
france
and
then
his
aoi
rang
forth
so
loud
and
clear
like
any
trumpet
blast
under
the
oaken
glades
that
the
wild
men
leaped
to
their
feet
and
shouted
health
to
the
gleeman
health
to
the
abbot
thorold
i
have
won
them
thought
the
abbot
to
himself
strange
mixture
that
man
must
have
been
if
all
which
is
told
of
him
is
true
a
very
typical
norman
compact
of
cunning
and
ferocity
chivalry
and
poetry
vanity
and
superstition
and
yet
able
enough
to
help
to
conquer
england
for
the
pope
then
he
pressed
hereward
to
sing
with
many
compliments
and
hereward
sang
and
sang
again
and
all
his
men
crowded
round
him
as
the
outlaws
of
judaea
may
have
crowded
round
david
in
carmel
or
hebron
to
hear
like
children
old
ditties
which
they
loved
the
better
the
oftener
they
heard
them
no
wonder
that
you
can
keep
these
knights
together
if
you
can
charm
them
thus
with
song
would
that
i
could
hear
you
singing
thus
in
william
s
no
more
of
that
sir
abbot
the
only
music
which
i
have
for
william
is
the
music
of
steel
on
hereward
answered
sharply
because
he
was
half
of
thorold
s
mind
now
said
torfrida
as
it
grew
late
we
must
ask
our
noble
guest
for
what
he
can
give
us
as
easily
and
well
as
he
can
song
and
that
is
news
we
hear
naught
here
in
the
greenwood
and
must
throw
oneself
on
the
kindness
of
a
chance
the
abbot
leapt
at
the
bait
and
told
them
news
court
gossip
bringing
in
great
folks
names
and
his
own
as
often
and
as
familiarly
mingled
as
he
could
what
of
richilda
asked
torfrida
ever
since
young
arnoul
was
killed
at
cassel
arnoul
killed
shrieked
torfrida
is
it
possible
that
you
do
not
know
how
should
i
know
shut
up
in
ely
for
years
it
but
they
fought
at
cassel
three
months
before
you
went
to
be
it
so
only
tell
me
arnoul
killed
then
the
abbot
told
not
without
feeling
a
fearful
story
robert
the
frison
and
richilda
had
come
to
open
war
and
gerbod
the
fleming
earl
of
clueter
had
gone
over
from
england
to
help
robert
william
had
sent
earl
of
hereford
the
scourge
and
tyrant
of
the
welsh
to
help
richilda
fitz
osbern
had
married
her
there
and
then
she
had
asked
help
of
her
liege
lord
the
king
of
france
and
he
had
sent
her
troops
robert
and
richilda
had
fought
on
peter
s
day
nearly
two
years
before
at
bavinchorum
by
cassel
richilda
had
played
the
heroine
and
routed
robert
s
left
wing
taken
him
prisoner
and
sent
him
off
to
omer
men
said
that
she
had
done
it
by
her
enchantments
but
her
enchantments
betrayed
her
nevertheless
fitz
osbern
her
bridegroom
fell
dead
young
arnoul
had
two
horses
killed
under
him
then
gerbod
smote
him
to
the
ground
and
richilda
and
her
troops
fled
in
horror
richilda
was
taken
and
exchanged
for
the
frison
at
which
the
king
of
france
being
enraged
had
come
down
and
burnt
omer
then
richilda
undaunted
had
raised
fresh
troops
to
avenge
her
son
then
robert
had
met
them
at
broqueroie
by
mons
and
smote
them
with
a
dreadful
slaughter
footnote
the
place
was
called
till
late
and
may
be
now
the
hedges
of
then
richilda
had
turned
and
fled
wildly
into
a
convent
and
so
men
said
tortured
herself
night
and
day
with
fearful
penances
if
by
any
means
she
might
atone
for
her
great
sins
torfrida
heard
and
laid
her
head
upon
her
knees
and
wept
so
bitterly
that
the
abbot
entreated
pardon
for
having
pained
her
so
much
the
news
had
a
deep
and
lasting
effect
on
her
the
thought
of
richilda
shivering
and
starving
in
the
squalid
darkness
of
a
convent
abode
by
her
thenceforth
should
she
ever
find
herself
atoning
in
like
wise
for
her
sorceries
harmless
as
they
had
been
for
her
ambitions
just
as
they
had
been
for
her
crimes
but
she
had
committed
none
no
she
had
sinned
in
many
things
but
she
was
not
as
richilda
and
yet
in
the
loneliness
and
sadness
of
the
forest
she
could
not
put
richilda
from
before
the
eyes
of
her
mind
it
saddened
hereward
likewise
for
richilda
he
cared
little
but
that
boy
how
he
had
loved
him
how
he
had
taught
him
to
ride
and
sing
and
joust
and
handle
sword
and
all
the
art
of
war
how
his
own
rough
soul
had
been
the
better
for
that
love
how
he
had
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
arnoul
should
be
a
great
prince
and
requite
him
with
love
now
he
was
gone
gone
who
was
not
gone
or
going
he
seemed
to
himself
the
last
tree
in
the
forest
when
should
his
time
come
and
the
lightning
strike
him
down
to
rot
beside
the
rest
but
he
tost
the
sad
thoughts
aside
he
could
not
afford
to
nourish
them
it
was
his
only
chance
of
life
to
be
merry
and
desperate
well
said
hereward
ere
they
hapt
themselves
up
for
the
night
we
owe
you
thanks
abbot
thorold
for
an
evening
worthy
of
a
king
s
court
rather
than
a
i
have
won
him
over
thought
the
abbot
so
charming
a
courtier
so
sweet
a
minstrel
so
agreeable
a
newsmonger
could
i
keep
you
in
a
cage
forever
and
hang
you
on
a
bough
i
were
but
too
happy
but
you
are
too
fine
a
bird
to
sing
in
captivity
so
you
must
go
i
fear
and
leave
us
to
the
nightingales
and
i
will
take
for
your
ransom
abbot
thorold
s
heart
beat
high
thirty
thousand
silver
thirty
thousand
fiends
my
beau
sire
will
you
undervalue
yourself
will
you
degrade
yourself
i
took
abbot
thorold
from
his
talk
to
be
a
man
who
set
even
a
higher
value
on
himself
than
other
men
set
on
him
what
higher
compliment
can
i
pay
to
your
vast
worth
than
making
your
ransom
high
accordingly
after
the
spirit
of
our
ancient
english
laws
take
it
as
it
is
meant
beau
sire
be
proud
to
pay
the
money
and
we
will
throw
you
sir
ascelin
into
the
bargain
as
he
seems
a
friend
of
siward
thorold
hoped
that
hereward
was
drunk
and
might
forget
or
relent
but
he
was
so
sore
at
heart
that
he
slept
not
a
wink
that
night
but
in
the
morning
he
found
to
his
sorrow
that
hereward
had
been
as
sober
as
himself
in
fine
he
had
to
pay
the
money
and
was
a
poor
man
all
his
days
aha
sir
ascelin
said
hereward
apart
as
he
bade
them
all
farewell
with
many
courtesies
i
think
i
have
put
a
spoke
in
your
wheel
about
the
fair
eh
how
most
courteous
victor
sir
ascelin
is
not
a
very
wealthy
ascelin
laughed
assent
nudus
intravi
nudus
exeo
england
and
i
fear
now
this
mortal
life
but
he
looked
to
his
rich
uncle
the
abbot
to
further
a
certain
of
his
and
of
course
neither
my
friend
gilbert
of
ghent
nor
my
enemy
william
of
normandy
are
likely
to
give
away
so
rich
an
heiress
without
some
gratification
in
sir
hereward
knows
the
world
it
so
he
has
been
told
before
and
therefore
having
no
intention
that
sir
ascelin
however
worthy
of
any
and
every
fair
lady
should
marry
this
one
he
took
care
to
cut
off
the
stream
at
the
if
he
hears
that
the
suit
is
still
pushed
he
may
cut
off
another
head
beside
the
fountain
there
will
be
no
need
said
ascelin
laughing
again
you
have
very
sufficiently
ruined
my
uncle
and
my
my
head
said
he
as
soon
as
hereward
was
out
of
hearing
if
i
do
not
cut
off
thy
head
ere
all
is
over
there
is
neither
luck
nor
craft
left
among
normans
i
shall
catch
the
wake
sleeping
some
day
let
him
be
never
so
chapter
xxxvi
how
alftruda
wrote
to
hereward
the
weary
months
ran
on
from
summer
into
winter
and
winter
into
summer
again
for
two
years
and
more
and
neither
torfrida
nor
hereward
were
the
better
for
them
hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
sick
and
a
sick
heart
is
but
too
apt
to
be
a
peevish
one
so
there
were
fits
of
despondency
jars
mutual
recriminations
if
i
had
not
taken
your
advice
i
should
not
have
been
if
i
had
not
loved
you
so
well
i
might
have
been
very
differently
off
and
so
forth
the
words
were
wiped
away
the
next
hour
perhaps
the
next
minute
by
sacred
kisses
but
they
had
been
said
and
would
be
recollected
and
perhaps
said
again
then
again
the
merry
greenwood
was
merry
enough
in
the
summer
tide
when
shaughs
were
green
and
the
woodwele
sang
and
would
not
cease
sitting
upon
the
spray
so
loud
it
wakened
robin
hood
in
the
greenwood
where
he
but
it
was
a
sad
place
enough
when
the
autumn
fog
crawled
round
the
gorse
and
dripped
off
the
hollies
and
choked
alike
the
breath
and
the
eyesight
when
the
air
sickened
with
the
graveyard
smell
of
rotting
leaves
and
the
stood
in
the
clay
holes
over
the
poached
and
sloppy
lawns
it
was
merry
enough
too
when
they
were
in
winter
quarters
in
friendly
as
long
as
the
bright
sharp
frosts
lasted
and
they
tracked
the
hares
and
deer
merrily
over
the
frozen
snows
but
it
was
doleful
enough
in
those
same
in
the
howling
wet
weather
when
wind
and
rain
lashed
in
through
unglazed
window
and
roof
and
there
were
coughs
and
colds
and
rheumatisms
and
torfrida
ached
from
head
to
foot
and
once
could
not
stand
upright
for
a
whole
month
together
and
every
cranny
was
stuffed
up
with
bits
of
board
and
rags
keeping
out
light
and
air
as
well
as
wind
and
water
and
there
was
little
difference
between
the
short
day
and
the
long
night
and
the
men
gambled
and
wrangled
amid
clouds
of
over
draughtboards
and
chessmen
which
they
had
carved
for
themselves
and
torfrida
sat
stitching
and
sewing
making
and
mending
her
eyes
bleared
with
her
hands
sore
and
coarse
from
continual
labor
her
cheek
bronzed
her
face
thin
and
hollow
and
all
her
beauty
worn
away
for
very
trouble
then
sometimes
there
was
not
enough
to
eat
and
every
one
grumbled
at
her
or
some
one
s
clothes
were
not
mended
and
she
was
grumbled
at
again
and
sometimes
a
foraging
party
brought
home
liquor
and
all
who
could
got
drunk
to
drive
dull
care
away
and
hereward
forgetful
of
all
her
warnings
got
more
than
was
good
for
him
likewise
and
at
night
she
coiled
herself
up
in
her
furs
cold
and
contemptuous
and
hereward
coiled
himself
up
guilty
and
defiant
and
woke
her
again
and
again
with
startings
and
wild
words
in
his
sleep
and
she
felt
that
her
beauty
was
gone
and
that
he
saw
it
and
she
fancied
him
perhaps
it
was
only
fancy
less
tender
than
of
yore
and
then
in
very
pride
disdained
to
take
any
care
of
her
person
and
said
to
herself
though
she
dare
not
say
it
to
him
that
if
he
only
loved
her
for
her
face
he
did
not
love
her
at
all
and
because
she
fancied
him
cold
at
times
she
was
cold
likewise
and
grew
less
and
less
caressing
when
for
his
sake
as
well
as
her
own
she
should
have
grown
more
so
day
by
day
alas
for
them
there
are
many
excuses
sorrow
may
be
a
softening
medicine
at
last
but
at
first
it
is
apt
to
be
a
hardening
one
and
that
savage
outlaw
life
which
they
were
leading
can
never
have
been
a
wholesome
one
for
any
soul
of
man
and
its
graces
must
have
existed
only
in
the
brains
of
harpers
and
gleemen
away
from
law
from
from
refinement
from
elegance
from
the
very
sound
of
a
bell
they
were
sinking
gradually
down
to
the
level
of
the
coarse
men
and
women
whom
they
saw
the
worse
and
not
the
better
parts
of
both
their
characters
were
getting
the
upper
hand
and
it
was
but
too
possible
that
after
a
while
the
hero
might
sink
into
the
ruffian
the
lady
into
a
slattern
and
a
shrew
but
in
justice
to
them
be
it
said
that
neither
of
them
had
complained
of
the
other
to
any
living
soul
their
love
had
been
as
yet
too
perfect
too
sacred
for
them
to
confess
to
another
and
thereby
confess
to
themselves
that
it
could
in
any
wise
fail
they
had
each
idolized
the
other
and
been
too
proud
of
their
idolatry
to
allow
that
their
idol
could
crumble
or
decay
and
yet
at
last
that
point
too
was
reached
one
day
they
were
wrangling
about
somewhat
as
they
too
often
wrangled
and
hereward
in
his
temper
let
fall
the
words
as
i
said
to
winter
the
other
day
you
grow
harder
and
harder
upon
torfrida
started
and
fixed
on
him
wide
terrible
scornful
eyes
so
you
complain
of
me
to
your
boon
companions
and
she
turned
and
went
away
without
a
word
a
gulf
had
opened
between
them
they
hardly
spoke
to
each
other
for
a
week
hereward
complained
of
torfrida
what
if
torfrida
should
complain
of
hereward
but
to
whom
not
to
the
coarse
women
round
her
her
pride
revolted
from
that
thought
and
yet
she
longed
for
counsel
for
sympathy
to
open
her
heart
but
to
one
she
would
go
to
the
lady
godiva
at
crowland
and
take
counsel
of
her
whether
there
was
any
method
for
so
she
put
it
to
herself
of
saving
hereward
for
she
saw
but
too
clearly
that
he
was
fast
forgetting
all
her
teaching
and
falling
back
to
a
point
lower
than
that
even
from
which
she
had
raised
him
up
to
go
to
crowland
was
not
difficult
it
was
the
dikes
were
all
frozen
hereward
was
out
foraging
in
the
lincolnshire
wolds
so
torfrida
taking
advantage
of
his
absence
proposed
another
foraging
party
to
crowland
itself
she
wanted
stuff
for
clothes
needles
thread
what
not
a
dozen
stout
fellows
volunteered
at
once
to
take
her
the
friendly
monks
of
crowland
would
feast
them
royally
and
send
them
home
heaped
with
all
manner
of
good
things
while
as
for
meeting
ivo
taillebois
s
men
if
they
had
but
three
to
one
against
them
there
was
a
fair
chance
of
killing
a
few
and
carrying
off
their
clothes
and
weapons
which
would
be
useful
so
they
made
a
sledge
tied
underneath
it
put
torfrida
thereon
well
wrapped
in
deer
and
fox
and
badger
skin
and
then
putting
on
their
skates
swept
her
over
the
fen
to
crowland
singing
like
larks
along
the
dikes
and
torfrida
went
in
to
godiva
and
wept
upon
her
knees
and
godiva
wept
likewise
and
gave
her
such
counsel
as
she
could
how
if
the
woman
will
keep
the
men
heroic
she
must
keep
herself
not
heroic
only
but
devout
likewise
how
she
herself
by
that
one
deed
which
had
rendered
her
name
famous
then
and
famous
though
she
never
dreamt
thereof
now
and
it
may
be
to
the
end
of
time
had
once
for
all
tamed
chained
and
as
it
were
converted
the
heart
of
her
fierce
young
lord
and
enabled
her
to
train
him
in
good
time
into
the
most
wise
most
just
most
pious
of
all
king
edward
s
earls
and
torfrida
said
yes
and
yes
and
yes
and
felt
in
her
heart
that
she
knew
all
that
already
had
not
she
too
taught
entreated
softened
civilized
had
not
she
too
spent
her
life
upon
a
man
and
that
man
a
wolf
and
a
landless
outlaw
more
utterly
than
godiva
could
ever
have
spent
hers
on
one
who
lived
lapped
in
luxury
and
wealth
and
power
torfrida
had
done
her
best
and
she
had
failed
or
at
least
fancied
in
her
haste
that
she
had
failed
what
she
wanted
was
not
counsel
but
love
and
she
clung
round
the
lady
godiva
till
the
broken
and
ruined
widow
opened
all
her
heart
to
her
and
took
her
in
her
arms
and
fondled
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
babe
and
the
two
women
spoke
few
words
after
that
for
indeed
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
only
at
last
my
child
my
child
cried
godiva
better
for
thee
body
and
soul
to
be
here
with
me
in
the
house
of
god
than
there
amid
evil
spirits
and
deeds
of
darkness
in
the
wild
not
a
cloister
not
a
cloister
cried
torfrida
shuddering
and
half
struggling
to
get
away
it
is
the
only
place
poor
wilful
child
the
only
place
this
side
the
grave
in
which
we
wretched
creatures
who
for
our
sins
are
women
born
can
find
aught
of
rest
or
peace
by
us
sin
came
into
the
world
and
eve
s
curse
lies
heavy
on
us
to
this
day
and
our
desire
is
to
our
lords
and
they
rule
over
us
and
when
the
slave
can
work
for
her
master
no
more
what
better
than
to
crawl
into
the
house
of
god
and
lay
down
our
crosses
at
the
foot
of
his
cross
and
die
you
too
will
come
here
torfrida
some
day
i
know
it
well
you
too
will
come
here
to
never
never
shrieked
torfrida
never
to
these
horrid
vaults
i
will
die
in
the
fresh
air
i
will
be
buried
under
the
green
hollies
and
the
nightingales
as
they
wander
up
from
my
own
provence
shall
build
and
sing
over
my
grave
never
never
murmured
she
to
herself
all
the
more
eagerly
because
something
within
her
said
that
it
would
come
to
pass
the
two
women
went
into
the
church
to
matins
and
prayed
long
and
fervently
and
at
the
early
daybreak
the
party
went
back
laden
with
good
things
and
hearty
blessings
and
caught
one
of
ivo
taillebois
s
men
by
the
way
and
slew
him
and
got
off
him
a
new
suit
of
clothes
in
which
the
poor
fellow
was
going
courting
and
so
they
got
home
safe
into
the
bruneswald
but
torfrida
had
not
found
rest
unto
her
soul
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
since
she
became
the
bride
of
hereward
she
had
had
a
confidence
concerning
him
and
unknown
to
him
it
was
to
his
own
mother
true
and
yet
she
felt
as
if
she
had
betrayed
him
but
then
had
he
not
betrayed
her
and
to
winter
of
all
men
it
might
have
been
two
months
afterwards
that
martin
lightfoot
put
a
letter
into
torfrida
s
hand
the
letter
was
addressed
to
hereward
but
there
was
nothing
strange
in
martin
s
bringing
it
to
his
mistress
ever
since
their
marriage
she
had
opened
and
generally
answered
the
very
few
epistles
with
which
her
husband
was
troubled
she
was
going
to
open
this
one
as
a
matter
of
course
when
glancing
at
the
superscription
she
saw
or
fancied
she
saw
that
it
was
in
a
woman
s
hand
she
looked
at
it
again
it
was
sealed
plainly
with
a
woman
s
seal
and
she
looked
up
at
martin
lightfoot
she
had
remarked
as
he
gave
her
the
letter
a
sly
significant
look
in
his
face
what
doest
thou
know
of
this
letter
she
inquired
sharply
that
it
is
from
the
countess
alftruda
whomsoever
she
may
a
chill
struck
through
her
heart
true
alftruda
had
written
before
only
to
warn
hereward
of
danger
to
his
life
and
hers
she
might
be
writing
again
only
for
the
same
purpose
but
still
she
did
not
wish
that
either
hereward
or
she
should
owe
alftruda
their
lives
or
anything
they
had
struggled
on
through
weal
and
woe
without
her
for
many
a
year
let
them
do
so
without
her
still
that
alftruda
had
once
loved
hereward
she
knew
well
why
should
she
not
the
wonder
was
to
her
that
every
woman
did
not
love
him
but
she
had
long
since
gauged
alftruda
s
character
and
seen
in
it
a
persistence
like
her
own
yet
as
she
proudly
hoped
of
a
lower
temper
the
persistence
of
the
base
weasel
not
of
the
noble
hound
yet
the
creeping
weasel
might
endure
and
win
when
the
hound
was
tired
out
by
his
own
gallant
pace
and
there
was
a
something
in
the
tone
of
alftruda
s
last
letter
which
seemed
to
tell
her
that
the
weasel
was
still
upon
the
scent
of
its
game
but
she
was
too
proud
to
mistrust
hereward
or
rather
to
seem
to
mistrust
him
and
yet
how
dangerous
alftruda
might
be
as
a
rival
if
rival
she
choose
to
be
she
was
up
in
the
world
now
free
rich
gay
beautiful
a
favorite
at
queen
matilda
s
court
while
she
how
came
this
letter
into
thy
hands
asked
she
as
carelessly
as
she
could
i
was
in
peterborough
last
night
said
martin
concerning
little
matters
of
my
own
and
there
came
to
me
in
the
street
a
bonny
young
page
with
smart
jacket
on
his
back
smart
cap
on
his
head
and
smiles
and
bows
and
you
are
one
of
hereward
s
men
quoth
say
that
again
young
jackanapes
said
i
and
i
ll
cut
your
tongue
out
whereat
he
took
fright
and
all
but
cried
he
was
very
sorry
and
meant
no
harm
but
he
had
a
letter
for
my
master
and
he
heard
i
was
one
of
his
men
who
told
him
that
well
one
of
the
monks
he
could
not
justly
say
which
or
wouldn
t
and
i
thinking
the
letter
of
more
importance
than
my
own
neck
ask
him
quietly
into
my
friend
s
house
there
he
pulls
out
this
and
five
silver
pennies
and
i
shall
have
five
more
if
i
bring
an
answer
back
but
to
none
than
hereward
must
i
give
it
with
that
i
calling
my
friend
who
is
an
honest
woman
and
nigh
as
strong
in
the
arms
as
i
am
ask
her
to
clap
her
back
against
the
door
and
pull
out
my
now
said
i
i
must
know
a
little
more
about
this
letter
tell
me
knave
who
gave
it
thee
or
i
ll
split
thy
the
young
man
cries
and
blubbers
and
says
that
it
is
the
countess
alftruda
who
is
staying
in
the
monastery
and
that
he
is
her
serving
man
and
that
it
is
as
much
as
my
life
is
worth
to
touch
a
hair
of
his
head
and
so
forth
so
far
so
good
then
i
asked
him
again
who
told
him
i
was
my
master
s
man
and
he
confessed
that
it
was
herluin
the
prior
he
that
was
lady
godiva
s
chaplain
of
old
whom
my
master
robbed
of
his
money
when
he
had
the
cell
of
bourne
years
agone
very
well
quoth
i
to
myself
that
s
one
more
count
on
our
score
against
master
herluin
then
i
asked
him
how
herluin
and
the
lady
alftruda
came
to
know
aught
of
each
other
and
he
said
that
she
had
been
questioning
all
about
the
monastery
without
abbot
thorold
s
knowledge
for
one
that
knew
hereward
and
favored
him
well
that
was
all
i
could
get
from
the
knave
he
cried
so
for
fright
so
i
took
his
money
and
his
letter
warning
him
that
if
he
betrayed
me
there
were
those
would
roast
him
alive
before
he
was
done
with
me
and
so
away
over
the
town
wall
and
ran
here
miles
before
breakfast
and
thought
it
better
as
you
see
to
give
the
letter
to
my
lady
you
have
been
officious
said
torfrida
coldly
tis
addressed
to
your
master
take
it
to
him
martin
lightfoot
whistled
and
obeyed
while
torfrida
walked
away
proudly
and
silently
with
a
beating
heart
again
godiva
s
words
came
over
her
should
she
end
in
the
convent
of
crowland
and
suspecting
fearing
imagining
all
sorts
of
baseless
phantoms
she
hardened
her
heart
into
a
great
hardness
martin
had
gone
with
the
letter
and
torfrida
never
heard
any
more
of
it
so
hereward
had
secrets
which
he
would
not
tell
to
her
at
last
that
at
least
was
a
misery
which
she
would
not
confide
to
lady
godiva
or
to
any
soul
on
earth
but
a
misery
it
was
such
a
misery
as
none
can
delineate
save
those
who
have
endured
it
themselves
or
had
it
confided
to
them
by
another
and
happy
are
they
to
whom
neither
has
befallen
she
wandered
on
and
into
the
and
sat
down
by
a
spring
she
looked
in
it
her
only
mirror
at
her
wan
coarse
face
with
wild
black
hanging
round
it
and
wondered
whether
alftruda
in
her
luxury
and
prosperity
was
still
so
very
beautiful
ah
that
that
fountain
were
the
fountain
of
jouvence
the
spring
of
perpetual
youth
which
all
believed
in
those
days
to
exist
somewhere
how
would
she
plunge
into
it
and
be
young
and
fair
once
more
no
she
would
not
she
had
lived
her
life
and
lived
it
well
gallantly
lovingly
heroically
she
had
given
that
man
her
youth
her
beauty
her
wealth
her
wit
he
should
not
have
them
a
second
time
he
had
had
his
will
of
her
if
he
chose
to
throw
her
away
when
he
had
done
with
her
to
prove
himself
base
at
last
unworthy
of
all
her
care
her
counsels
her
training
dreadful
thought
to
have
lived
to
keep
that
man
for
her
own
and
just
when
her
work
seemed
done
to
lose
him
no
there
was
worse
than
that
to
have
lived
that
she
might
make
that
man
a
perfect
knight
and
just
when
her
work
seemed
done
to
see
him
lose
himself
and
she
wept
till
she
could
weep
no
more
then
she
washed
away
her
tears
in
that
well
had
it
been
in
greece
of
old
that
well
would
have
become
a
sacred
well
thenceforth
and
torfrida
s
tears
have
changed
into
and
fringed
its
marge
with
azure
evermore
then
she
went
back
calm
all
but
cold
but
determined
not
to
betray
herself
let
him
do
what
he
would
perhaps
it
was
all
a
mistake
a
fancy
at
least
she
would
not
degrade
him
and
herself
by
showing
suspicion
it
would
be
dreadful
shameful
to
herself
wickedly
unjust
to
him
to
accuse
him
were
he
innocent
after
all
hereward
she
remarked
was
more
kind
to
her
now
but
it
was
a
kindness
which
she
did
not
like
it
was
shy
faltering
as
of
a
man
guilty
and
ashamed
and
she
repelled
it
as
much
as
she
dared
and
then
once
or
twice
returned
it
passionately
madly
in
hopes
but
he
never
spoke
a
word
of
that
letter
after
a
dreadful
month
martin
came
mysteriously
to
her
again
she
trembled
for
she
had
remarked
in
him
lately
a
strange
change
he
had
lost
his
usual
loquacity
and
quaint
humor
and
had
fallen
back
into
that
sullen
taciturnity
which
so
she
heard
he
had
kept
up
in
his
youth
he
too
must
know
evil
which
he
dared
not
tell
there
is
another
letter
come
it
came
last
night
said
he
what
is
that
to
thee
or
me
my
lord
has
his
state
secrets
is
it
for
us
to
pry
into
them
go
i
thought
i
thought
go
i
say
that
your
ladyship
might
wish
for
a
guide
to
crowland
almost
shrieked
torfrida
for
the
thought
of
crowland
had
risen
in
her
own
wretched
mind
instantly
and
involuntarily
go
madman
martin
went
torfrida
paced
madly
up
and
down
the
farmhouse
then
she
settled
herself
into
fierce
despair
there
was
a
noise
of
trampling
horses
outside
the
men
were
arming
and
saddling
seemingly
for
a
raid
hereward
hurried
in
for
his
armor
when
he
saw
torfrida
he
blushed
scarlet
you
want
your
arms
said
she
quietly
let
me
fetch
no
never
mind
i
can
harness
myself
i
am
going
southwest
to
pay
taillebois
a
visit
i
am
in
a
great
hurry
i
shall
be
back
in
three
days
then
he
snatched
his
arms
off
a
perch
and
hurried
out
again
dragging
them
on
as
he
passed
her
he
offered
to
kiss
her
she
put
him
back
and
helped
him
on
with
his
armor
while
he
thanked
her
confusedly
he
was
as
glad
not
to
kiss
me
after
all
she
looked
after
him
as
he
stood
his
hand
on
his
horse
s
withers
how
noble
he
looked
and
a
great
yearning
came
over
her
to
throw
her
arms
round
his
neck
once
and
then
to
stab
herself
and
set
him
free
dying
as
she
had
lived
for
him
two
bonny
boys
were
wrestling
on
the
lawn
young
outlaws
who
had
grown
up
in
the
forest
with
ruddy
cheeks
and
iron
limbs
ah
winter
she
heard
him
say
had
i
had
such
a
boy
as
that
she
heard
no
more
she
turned
away
her
heart
dead
within
her
she
knew
all
that
these
words
implied
in
days
when
the
possession
of
land
was
everything
to
the
free
man
and
the
possession
of
a
son
necessary
to
pass
that
land
on
in
the
ancestral
line
only
to
have
a
son
only
to
prevent
the
old
estate
passing
with
an
heiress
into
the
hands
of
strangers
what
crimes
did
not
men
commit
in
those
days
and
find
themselves
excused
for
them
by
public
opinion
and
now
her
other
children
if
she
ever
had
any
had
died
in
childhood
the
little
torfrida
named
after
herself
was
all
that
she
had
brought
to
hereward
and
he
was
the
last
of
his
house
in
him
the
race
of
leofric
of
godiva
of
earl
oslac
would
become
extinct
and
that
girl
would
marry
whom
whom
but
some
french
conqueror
or
at
best
some
english
outlaw
in
either
case
hereward
would
have
no
descendants
for
whom
it
was
worth
his
while
to
labor
or
to
fight
what
wonder
if
he
longed
for
a
son
and
not
a
son
of
hers
the
barren
tree
to
pass
his
name
down
to
future
generations
it
might
be
worth
while
for
that
to
come
in
to
the
king
to
recover
his
lands
to
she
saw
it
all
now
and
her
heart
was
dead
within
her
she
spent
that
evening
neither
eating
nor
drinking
but
sitting
over
the
log
embers
her
head
upon
her
hands
and
thinking
over
all
her
past
life
and
love
since
she
saw
him
from
the
gable
window
ride
the
first
time
into
omer
she
went
through
it
all
with
a
certain
stern
delight
in
the
deliberately
day
by
day
year
by
year
all
its
lofty
aspirations
all
its
blissful
passages
all
its
deep
disappointments
and
found
in
it
so
she
chose
to
fancy
in
the
wilfulness
of
her
misery
nothing
but
cause
for
remorse
self
in
all
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
for
herself
she
had
loved
him
for
herself
she
had
tried
to
raise
him
for
herself
she
had
set
her
heart
on
man
and
not
on
god
she
had
sown
the
wind
and
behold
she
had
reaped
the
whirlwind
she
could
not
repent
she
could
not
pray
but
oh
that
she
could
die
she
was
unjust
to
herself
in
her
great
nobleness
it
was
not
true
not
half
not
a
tenth
part
true
but
perhaps
it
was
good
for
her
that
it
should
seem
true
for
that
moment
that
she
should
be
emptied
of
all
earthly
things
for
once
if
so
she
might
be
filled
from
above
at
last
she
went
into
the
inner
room
to
lie
down
and
try
to
sleep
at
her
feet
under
the
perch
where
hereward
s
armor
had
hung
lay
an
open
letter
she
picked
it
up
surprised
at
seeing
such
a
thing
there
and
kneeling
down
held
it
eagerly
to
the
wax
candle
which
was
on
a
spike
at
the
bed
s
head
she
knew
the
handwriting
in
a
moment
it
was
alftruda
s
this
then
was
why
hereward
had
been
so
strangely
hurried
he
must
have
had
that
letter
and
dropped
it
her
eye
and
mind
took
it
all
in
in
one
instant
as
the
lightning
flash
reveals
a
whole
landscape
and
then
her
mind
became
as
dark
as
that
landscape
when
the
flash
is
past
it
congratulated
hereward
on
having
shaken
himself
free
from
the
fascination
of
that
sorceress
it
said
that
all
was
settled
with
king
william
hereward
was
to
come
to
winchester
she
had
the
king
s
writ
for
his
safety
ready
to
send
to
him
the
king
would
receive
him
as
his
liegeman
alftruda
would
receive
him
as
her
husband
archbishop
lanfranc
had
made
difficulties
about
the
dissolution
of
the
marriage
with
torfrida
but
gold
would
do
all
things
at
rome
and
lanfranc
was
her
very
good
friend
and
a
reasonable
man
and
so
forth
men
and
beasts
likewise
when
stricken
with
a
mortal
wound
will
run
and
run
on
blindly
aimless
impelled
by
the
mere
instinct
of
escape
from
intolerable
agony
and
so
did
torfrida
half
undrest
as
she
was
she
fled
forth
into
the
forest
she
knew
not
whither
running
as
one
does
wrapt
in
fire
but
the
fire
was
not
without
her
but
within
she
cast
a
passing
glance
at
the
girl
who
lay
by
her
sleeping
a
pure
and
gentle
sleep
o
that
thou
hadst
but
been
a
boy
then
she
thought
no
more
of
her
not
even
of
hereward
but
all
of
which
she
was
conscious
was
a
breast
and
brain
bursting
an
intolerable
choking
from
which
she
must
escape
she
ran
and
ran
on
for
miles
she
knew
not
whether
the
night
was
light
or
dark
warm
or
cold
her
tender
feet
might
have
been
ankle
deep
in
snow
the
branches
over
her
head
might
have
been
howling
in
the
tempest
or
dripping
with
rain
she
knew
not
and
heeded
not
the
owls
hooted
to
each
other
under
the
staring
moon
but
she
heard
them
not
the
wolves
glared
at
her
from
the
brakes
and
slunk
off
appalled
at
the
white
ghostly
figure
but
she
saw
them
not
the
deer
stood
at
gaze
in
the
glades
till
she
was
close
upon
them
and
then
bounded
into
the
wood
she
ran
right
at
them
past
them
heedless
she
had
but
one
thought
to
flee
from
the
agony
of
a
soul
alone
in
the
universe
with
its
own
misery
at
last
she
was
aware
of
a
man
close
beside
her
he
had
been
following
her
a
long
way
she
recollected
now
but
she
had
not
feared
him
even
heeded
him
but
when
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm
she
turned
fiercely
but
without
dread
she
looked
to
see
if
it
was
hereward
to
meet
him
would
be
death
if
it
were
not
he
she
cared
not
who
it
was
it
was
not
hereward
and
she
cried
angrily
off
off
and
hurried
on
but
you
are
going
the
wrong
way
the
wrong
way
said
the
voice
of
martin
lightfoot
the
wrong
way
fool
which
is
the
right
way
for
me
save
the
path
which
leads
to
a
land
where
all
is
forgotten
to
crowland
to
crowland
to
the
minster
to
the
monks
that
is
the
only
right
way
for
poor
wretches
in
a
world
like
this
the
lady
godiva
told
you
you
must
go
to
crowland
and
now
you
are
going
i
too
i
ran
away
from
a
monastery
when
i
was
young
and
now
i
am
going
back
come
along
you
are
right
crowland
crowland
and
a
nun
s
cell
till
death
which
is
the
way
martin
o
a
wise
lady
a
reasonable
lady
but
you
will
be
cold
before
you
get
thither
there
will
be
a
frost
ere
morn
so
when
i
saw
you
run
out
i
caught
up
something
to
put
over
torfrida
shuddered
as
martin
wrapped
her
in
the
white
bearskin
no
not
that
anything
but
that
and
she
struggled
to
shake
it
off
then
you
will
be
dead
ere
dawn
folks
that
run
wild
in
the
forest
thus
for
but
one
night
die
would
god
i
could
die
that
shall
be
as
he
wills
you
do
not
die
while
martin
can
keep
you
alive
why
you
are
staggering
martin
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
threw
her
over
his
shoulder
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
and
hurried
on
in
the
strength
of
madness
at
last
he
stopped
at
a
cottage
door
set
her
down
upon
the
turf
and
knocked
loudly
grimkel
tolison
grimkel
i
say
and
martin
burst
the
door
open
with
his
foot
give
me
a
horse
on
your
life
said
he
to
the
man
inside
i
am
martin
hereward
s
man
upon
my
master
s
what
is
mine
is
hereward
s
god
bless
him
said
the
man
struggling
into
a
garment
and
hurrying
out
to
the
shed
there
is
a
ghost
against
the
gate
cried
he
recoiling
that
is
my
matter
not
yours
get
me
a
horse
to
put
the
ghost
torfrida
lay
against
the
exhausted
now
but
quite
unable
to
think
martin
lifted
her
on
to
the
beast
and
led
her
onward
holding
her
up
again
and
again
you
are
tired
you
had
run
four
miles
before
i
could
make
you
hear
would
i
had
run
four
and
she
relapsed
into
stupor
they
passed
out
of
the
forest
across
open
wolds
and
at
last
down
to
the
river
martin
knew
of
a
boat
there
he
lifted
her
from
the
horse
turned
him
loose
put
torfrida
into
the
boat
and
took
the
oars
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
roofs
of
bourne
shining
white
in
the
moonlight
and
then
she
lifted
up
her
voice
and
shrieked
three
times
lost
lost
lost
with
such
a
dreadful
cry
that
the
starlings
whirred
up
from
the
reeds
and
the
rose
clanging
off
the
meres
and
the
in
bourne
and
mainthorpe
barked
and
howled
and
folk
told
fearfully
next
morning
how
a
white
ghost
had
gone
down
from
the
forest
to
the
fen
and
wakened
them
with
its
unearthly
cry
the
sun
was
high
when
they
came
to
crowland
minster
torfrida
had
neither
spoken
nor
stirred
and
martin
who
in
the
midst
of
his
madness
kept
a
strange
courtesy
and
delicacy
had
never
disturbed
her
save
to
wrap
the
more
closely
over
her
when
they
came
to
the
bank
she
rose
stepped
out
without
his
help
and
drawing
the
closely
round
her
and
over
her
head
walked
straight
up
to
the
gate
of
the
house
of
nuns
all
men
wondered
at
the
white
ghost
but
martin
walked
behind
her
his
left
finger
on
his
lips
his
right
hand
grasping
his
little
axe
with
such
a
stern
and
serious
face
and
so
fierce
an
eye
that
all
drew
back
in
silence
and
let
her
pass
the
portress
looked
through
the
wicket
i
am
torfrida
said
a
voice
of
terrible
calm
i
am
come
to
see
the
lady
godiva
let
me
the
portress
opened
utterly
astounded
madam
said
martin
eagerly
as
torfrida
entered
what
what
she
seemed
to
waken
from
a
dream
god
bless
thee
thou
good
and
faithful
servant
and
she
turned
again
madam
say
what
shall
i
go
back
and
kill
him
and
he
held
out
the
little
axe
torfrida
snatched
it
from
his
grasp
with
a
shriek
and
cast
it
inside
the
convent
door
mother
mary
and
all
saints
cried
the
portress
your
garments
are
in
rags
madam
never
mind
bring
me
garments
of
yours
i
shall
need
none
other
till
i
die
and
she
walked
in
and
on
she
is
come
to
be
a
nun
whispered
the
portress
to
the
next
sister
and
she
again
to
the
next
and
they
all
gabbled
and
lifted
up
their
hands
and
eyes
and
thanked
all
the
saints
of
the
calendar
over
the
blessed
and
miraculous
conversion
of
the
lady
torfrida
and
the
wealth
which
she
would
probably
bring
to
the
convent
torfrida
went
straight
on
speaking
to
no
one
not
even
to
the
prioress
and
into
lady
godiva
s
chamber
there
she
dropped
at
the
countess
s
feet
and
laid
her
head
upon
her
knees
i
am
come
as
you
always
told
me
i
should
do
but
it
has
been
a
long
way
hither
and
i
am
very
my
child
what
is
this
what
brings
you
here
i
am
doing
penance
for
my
and
your
feet
all
cut
and
are
they
said
torfrida
vacantly
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
when
i
and
she
fell
fast
asleep
with
her
head
in
godiva
s
lap
the
countess
did
not
speak
or
stir
she
beckoned
the
good
prioress
who
had
followed
torfrida
in
to
go
away
she
saw
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
and
prayed
as
she
awaited
the
news
torfrida
slept
for
a
full
hour
then
she
woke
with
a
start
where
am
i
hereward
then
followed
a
dreadful
shriek
which
made
every
nun
in
that
quiet
house
shudder
and
thank
god
that
she
knew
nothing
of
those
agonies
of
soul
which
were
the
lot
of
the
foolish
virgins
who
married
and
were
given
in
marriage
themselves
instead
of
waiting
with
oil
in
their
lamps
for
the
true
bridegroom
i
recollect
all
now
said
torfrida
listen
and
she
told
the
countess
all
with
speech
so
calm
and
clear
that
godiva
was
awed
by
the
power
and
spirit
of
that
marvellous
woman
but
she
groaned
in
bitterness
of
soul
anything
but
this
rather
death
from
him
than
treachery
this
last
worst
woe
had
god
kept
in
his
quiver
for
me
most
miserable
of
women
and
now
his
bolt
has
fallen
hereward
hereward
that
thy
mother
should
wish
her
last
child
laid
in
his
grave
not
so
said
torfrida
it
is
well
as
it
is
how
better
it
is
his
only
chance
for
comfort
for
honor
for
life
itself
he
would
have
grown
a
i
was
growing
bad
and
foul
myself
in
that
ugly
wilderness
now
he
will
be
a
knight
once
more
among
knights
and
win
himself
fresh
honor
in
fresh
fields
let
him
marry
her
why
not
he
can
get
a
dispensation
from
the
pope
and
then
there
will
be
no
sin
in
it
you
know
if
the
holy
father
can
not
make
wrong
right
who
can
yes
it
is
very
well
as
it
is
and
i
am
very
well
where
i
am
women
bring
me
scissors
and
one
of
your
nun
s
dresses
i
am
come
to
be
a
nun
like
godiva
would
have
stopped
her
but
torfrida
rose
upon
her
knees
and
calmly
made
a
solemn
vow
which
though
canonically
void
without
her
husband
s
consent
would
she
well
knew
never
be
disputed
by
any
there
and
as
for
him
he
has
lost
me
and
forever
torfrida
never
gives
herself
away
there
s
carnal
pride
in
those
words
my
poor
child
said
godiva
cruel
said
she
proudly
when
i
am
sacrificing
myself
utterly
for
and
thy
poor
girl
he
will
let
her
come
hither
said
torfrida
with
forced
calm
he
will
see
that
it
is
not
fit
that
she
should
grow
up
with
yes
he
will
send
her
to
me
to
us
and
i
shall
live
for
her
and
for
you
if
you
will
let
me
be
your
bower
woman
dress
you
serve
you
read
to
you
you
know
that
i
am
a
pretty
scholar
you
will
let
me
mother
i
may
call
you
mother
may
i
not
and
torfrida
fondled
the
old
woman
s
thin
hands
for
i
do
want
so
much
something
to
love
thy
heavenly
bridegroom
the
only
love
worthy
of
woman
said
godiva
as
her
tears
fell
fast
on
torfrida
s
head
she
gave
a
toss
that
may
come
in
good
time
as
yet
it
is
enough
to
do
if
i
can
keep
down
this
devil
here
in
my
throat
women
bring
me
the
and
torfrida
cut
off
her
raven
locks
now
streaked
with
gray
and
put
on
the
nun
s
dress
and
became
a
nun
thenceforth
on
the
second
day
there
came
to
crowland
leofric
the
priest
and
with
him
the
poor
child
she
had
woke
in
the
morning
and
found
no
mother
leofric
and
the
other
men
searched
the
woods
round
far
and
wide
the
girl
mounted
her
horse
and
would
go
with
them
then
they
took
a
bloodhound
and
he
led
them
to
grimkel
s
hut
there
they
heard
of
martin
the
ghost
must
have
been
torfrida
then
the
hound
brought
them
to
the
river
and
they
divined
at
once
that
she
was
gone
to
crowland
to
godiva
but
why
they
could
not
guess
then
the
girl
insisted
prayed
at
last
commanded
them
to
take
her
to
crowland
and
to
crowland
they
came
leofric
left
the
girl
at
the
nun
s
house
door
and
went
into
the
monastery
where
he
had
friends
enow
runaway
and
renegade
as
he
was
as
he
came
into
the
great
court
whom
should
he
meet
but
martin
lightfoot
in
a
lay
brother
s
frock
aha
and
are
you
come
home
likewise
have
you
renounced
the
devil
and
this
last
work
of
his
what
work
what
devil
asked
leofric
who
saw
method
in
martin
s
madness
and
what
do
you
here
in
a
long
frock
devil
hereward
the
devil
i
would
have
killed
him
with
my
axe
but
she
got
it
from
me
and
threw
it
in
among
the
holy
sisters
and
i
had
work
to
get
it
again
shame
on
her
to
spoil
my
chance
of
heaven
for
i
should
have
surely
won
heaven
you
know
if
i
had
killed
the
after
much
beating
about
leofric
got
from
martin
the
whole
tragedy
and
when
he
heard
it
he
burst
out
weeping
o
hereward
hereward
o
knightly
honor
o
faith
and
troth
and
gratitude
and
love
in
return
for
such
love
as
might
have
tamed
lions
and
made
tyrants
mild
are
they
all
carnal
vanities
works
of
the
weak
flesh
bruised
reeds
which
break
when
they
are
leaned
upon
if
so
you
are
right
martin
and
there
is
naught
left
but
to
flee
from
a
world
in
which
all
men
are
and
leofric
in
the
midst
of
crowland
yard
tore
off
his
belt
and
trusty
sword
his
hauberk
and
helm
also
and
letting
down
his
monk
s
frock
which
he
wore
trussed
to
the
he
went
to
the
abbot
s
lodgings
and
asked
to
see
old
ulfketyl
bring
him
up
said
the
good
abbot
for
he
is
a
valiant
man
and
true
in
spite
of
all
his
vanities
and
may
be
he
brings
news
of
hereward
whom
god
and
when
leofric
came
in
he
fell
upon
his
knees
bewailing
and
confessing
his
sinful
life
and
begged
the
abbot
to
take
him
back
again
into
crowland
minster
and
lay
upon
him
what
penance
he
thought
fit
and
put
him
in
the
lowest
office
because
he
was
a
man
of
blood
if
only
he
might
stay
there
and
have
a
sight
at
times
of
his
dear
lady
torfrida
without
whom
he
should
surely
die
so
leofric
was
received
back
in
full
chapter
by
abbot
and
prior
and
all
the
monks
but
when
he
asked
them
to
lay
a
penance
upon
him
ulfketyl
arose
from
his
high
chair
and
spoke
shall
we
who
have
sat
here
at
ease
lay
a
penance
on
this
man
who
has
shed
his
blood
in
fifty
valiant
fights
for
us
and
for
guthlac
and
for
this
english
land
look
at
yon
scars
upon
his
head
and
arms
he
has
had
sharper
discipline
from
cold
steel
than
we
could
give
him
here
with
rod
and
has
fasted
in
the
wilderness
more
sorely
many
a
time
than
we
have
fasted
and
all
the
monks
agreed
that
no
penance
should
be
laid
on
leofric
only
that
he
should
abstain
from
singing
vain
and
carnal
ballads
which
turned
the
heads
of
the
young
brothers
and
made
them
dream
of
naught
but
battles
and
giants
and
enchanters
and
ladies
love
hereward
came
back
on
the
third
day
and
found
his
wife
and
daughter
gone
his
guilty
conscience
told
him
in
the
first
instant
why
for
he
went
into
the
chamber
and
there
upon
the
floor
lay
the
letter
which
he
had
looked
for
in
vain
no
one
had
touched
it
where
it
lay
perhaps
no
one
had
dared
to
enter
the
chamber
if
they
had
they
would
not
have
dared
to
meddle
with
writing
which
they
could
not
read
and
which
might
contain
some
magic
spell
letters
were
very
safe
in
those
old
days
there
are
moods
of
man
which
no
one
will
dare
to
describe
unless
like
shakespeare
he
is
shakespeare
and
like
shakespeare
knows
it
not
therefore
what
hereward
thought
and
felt
will
not
be
told
what
he
did
was
this
he
raged
and
blustered
he
must
hide
his
shame
he
must
justify
himself
to
his
knights
and
much
more
to
himself
or
if
not
justify
himself
must
shift
some
of
the
blame
over
to
the
opposite
side
so
he
raged
and
blustered
he
had
been
robbed
of
his
wife
and
daughter
they
had
been
cajoled
away
by
the
monks
of
crowland
what
villains
were
those
to
rob
an
honest
man
of
his
family
while
he
was
fighting
for
his
country
so
he
rode
down
to
the
river
and
there
took
two
great
barges
and
rowed
away
to
crowland
with
forty
and
all
the
while
he
thought
of
alftruda
as
he
had
seen
her
at
peterborough
and
of
no
one
else
not
so
for
all
the
while
he
felt
that
he
loved
torfrida
s
little
finger
better
than
alftruda
s
whole
body
and
soul
into
the
bargain
what
a
long
way
it
was
to
crowland
how
wearying
were
the
hours
through
mere
and
sea
how
wearying
the
monotonous
pulse
of
the
oars
if
tobacco
had
been
known
then
hereward
would
have
smoked
all
the
way
and
been
none
the
wiser
though
the
happier
for
it
for
the
herb
that
drives
away
the
evil
spirits
of
anxiety
drives
away
also
the
good
though
stern
spirits
of
remorse
but
in
those
days
a
man
could
only
escape
facts
by
drinking
and
hereward
was
too
much
afraid
of
what
he
should
meet
in
crowland
to
go
thither
drunk
sometimes
he
hoped
that
torfrida
might
hold
her
purpose
and
set
him
free
to
follow
his
wicked
will
all
the
lower
nature
in
him
so
long
crushed
under
leapt
up
chuckling
and
grinning
and
tumbling
head
over
heels
and
cried
now
i
shall
have
a
holiday
sometimes
he
hoped
that
torfrida
might
come
out
to
the
shore
and
settle
the
matter
in
one
moment
by
a
glance
of
her
great
hawk
s
eyes
if
she
would
but
quell
him
by
one
look
leap
on
board
seize
the
helm
and
assume
without
a
word
the
command
of
his
men
and
him
steer
them
back
to
bourne
and
sit
down
beside
him
with
a
kiss
as
if
nothing
had
happened
if
she
would
but
do
that
and
ignore
the
past
would
he
not
ignore
it
would
he
not
forget
alftruda
and
king
william
and
all
the
world
and
go
up
with
her
into
sherwood
and
then
north
to
scotland
and
gospatrick
and
be
a
man
once
more
no
he
would
go
with
her
to
the
baltic
or
the
mediterranean
constantinople
and
the
varangers
would
be
the
place
and
the
men
ay
there
to
escape
out
of
that
charmed
ring
into
a
new
life
no
he
did
not
deserve
such
luck
and
he
would
not
get
it
she
would
talk
it
all
out
she
must
for
she
was
a
woman
she
would
blame
argue
say
dreadful
words
dreadful
because
true
and
deserved
then
she
would
grow
angry
as
women
do
when
they
are
most
in
the
right
and
say
too
much
dreadful
words
which
would
be
untrue
and
undeserved
then
he
should
resist
recriminate
he
would
not
stand
it
he
could
not
stand
it
no
he
could
never
face
her
again
and
yet
if
he
had
seen
a
man
insult
her
if
he
had
seen
her
at
that
moment
in
peril
of
the
slightest
danger
the
slightest
bruise
he
would
have
rushed
forward
like
a
madman
and
died
saving
her
from
that
bruise
and
he
knew
that
and
with
the
strange
of
human
nature
he
soothed
his
own
conscience
by
the
thought
that
he
loved
her
still
and
that
therefore
somehow
or
other
he
cared
not
to
make
out
how
he
had
done
her
no
wrong
then
he
blustered
again
for
the
benefit
of
his
men
he
would
teach
these
monks
of
crowland
a
lesson
he
would
burn
the
minster
over
their
heads
that
would
be
pity
seeing
they
are
the
only
englishmen
left
in
england
said
siward
the
white
his
nephew
very
simply
what
is
that
to
thee
thou
hast
helped
to
burn
peterborough
at
my
bidding
and
thou
shalt
help
to
burn
i
am
a
free
gentleman
of
england
and
what
i
choose
i
do
i
and
my
brother
are
going
to
constantinople
to
join
the
varanger
guard
and
shall
not
burn
crowland
or
let
any
man
burn
shall
not
let
no
said
the
young
man
so
quietly
that
hereward
was
cowed
i
i
only
meant
if
they
did
not
do
right
by
do
right
thyself
said
siward
hereward
swore
awfully
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
but
he
did
not
draw
it
for
he
thought
he
saw
overhead
a
cloud
which
was
very
like
the
figure
of
guthlac
in
crowland
window
and
an
awe
fell
upon
him
from
above
so
they
came
to
crowland
and
hereward
landed
and
beat
upon
the
gates
and
spoke
high
words
but
the
monks
did
not
open
the
gates
for
a
while
at
last
the
gates
creaked
and
opened
and
in
the
gateway
stood
abbot
ulfketyl
in
his
robes
of
state
and
behind
him
prior
and
all
the
officers
and
all
the
monks
of
the
house
comes
hereward
in
peace
or
in
war
in
war
said
hereward
then
that
true
and
trusty
old
man
who
sealed
his
patriotism
if
not
with
his
blood
for
the
very
normans
had
not
the
heart
to
take
that
still
with
long
and
bitter
sorrows
lifted
up
his
head
and
said
like
a
valiant
dane
as
his
name
bespoke
him
against
the
traitor
and
the
adulterer
i
am
neither
roared
hereward
thou
wouldst
be
if
thou
couldst
whoso
looketh
upon
a
woman
to
preach
me
no
sermons
man
let
me
in
to
seek
my
over
my
body
said
ulfketyl
and
laid
himself
down
across
the
threshold
hereward
recoiled
if
he
had
dared
to
step
over
that
sacred
body
there
was
not
a
ruffian
in
his
crew
who
dared
to
follow
him
rise
rise
for
god
s
sake
lord
abbot
said
he
whatever
i
am
i
need
not
that
you
should
disgrace
me
thus
only
let
me
see
her
reason
with
she
has
vowed
herself
to
god
and
is
none
of
thine
hence
it
is
against
the
canons
a
wrong
and
a
ulfketyl
rose
grand
as
ever
hereward
leofricsson
our
joy
and
our
glory
once
hearken
to
the
old
man
who
will
soon
go
whither
thine
uncle
brand
is
gone
and
be
free
of
frenchmen
and
of
all
this
wicked
world
when
the
walls
of
crowland
dare
not
shelter
the
wronged
woman
fleeing
from
man
s
treason
to
god
s
faithfulness
then
let
the
roofs
of
crowland
burn
till
the
flame
reaches
heaven
for
a
sign
that
the
children
of
god
are
as
false
as
the
children
of
this
world
and
break
their
faith
like
any
belted
hereward
was
silenced
his
men
shrunk
back
from
him
he
felt
as
if
god
and
the
mother
of
god
and
guthlac
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
were
shrinking
back
from
him
likewise
he
turned
to
supplications
compromises
what
else
was
left
at
least
you
will
let
me
have
speech
of
her
or
of
my
mother
they
must
answer
that
not
hereward
sent
in
entreating
to
see
one
or
both
tell
him
said
lady
godiva
who
calls
himself
my
son
that
my
sons
were
men
of
honor
and
that
he
must
have
been
changed
at
tell
him
said
torfrida
that
i
have
lived
my
life
and
am
dead
dead
if
he
would
see
me
he
will
only
see
my
you
would
not
slay
yourself
what
is
there
that
i
dare
not
do
you
do
not
know
torfrida
he
and
hereward
did
and
went
back
again
like
a
man
stunned
after
a
while
there
came
by
boat
to
crowland
all
torfrida
s
wealth
clothes
jewels
not
a
shred
had
hereward
kept
the
magic
armor
came
with
them
torfrida
gave
all
to
the
abbey
there
and
then
only
the
armor
she
wrapped
up
in
the
white
bear
s
skin
and
sent
it
back
to
hereward
with
her
blessing
and
entreaty
not
to
refuse
that
her
last
bequest
hereward
did
not
refuse
for
very
shame
but
for
very
shame
he
never
wore
that
armor
more
for
very
shame
he
never
slept
again
upon
the
white
bear
s
skin
on
which
he
and
his
true
love
had
lain
so
many
a
year
and
torfrida
turned
herself
utterly
to
serve
the
lady
godiva
and
to
teach
and
train
her
child
as
she
had
never
done
before
while
she
had
to
love
hereward
and
to
work
day
and
night
with
her
own
fingers
for
all
his
men
all
pride
all
fierceness
all
care
of
self
had
passed
away
from
her
in
penitence
humility
obedience
and
gentleness
she
went
on
never
smiling
but
never
weeping
her
heart
was
broken
and
she
felt
it
good
for
herself
to
let
it
break
and
leofric
the
priest
and
mad
martin
lightfoot
watched
like
two
dogs
for
her
going
out
and
coming
in
and
when
she
went
among
the
poor
corrodiers
and
nursed
the
sick
and
taught
the
children
and
went
to
and
fro
upon
her
holy
errands
blessing
and
blessed
the
two
wild
men
had
a
word
from
her
mouth
or
a
kiss
of
her
hand
and
were
happy
all
the
day
after
for
they
loved
her
with
a
love
mightier
than
ever
hereward
had
heaped
upon
her
for
she
had
given
him
all
but
she
had
given
those
two
wild
men
naught
but
the
beatific
vision
of
a
noble
woman
chapter
xxxvii
how
hereward
lost
sword
on
account
of
which
says
the
chronicler
many
troubles
came
to
hereward
because
torfrida
was
most
wise
and
of
great
counsel
in
need
for
afterwards
as
he
himself
confessed
things
went
not
so
well
with
him
as
they
did
in
her
and
the
first
thing
that
went
ill
was
this
he
was
riding
through
the
bruneswald
and
behind
him
geri
wenoch
and
matelgar
these
three
and
there
met
him
in
an
open
glade
a
knight
the
biggest
man
he
had
ever
seen
on
the
biggest
horse
and
five
knights
behind
him
he
was
an
englishman
and
not
a
frenchman
by
his
dress
and
hereward
spoke
courteously
enough
to
him
but
who
he
was
and
what
his
business
was
in
the
bruneswald
hereward
thought
that
he
had
a
right
to
ask
tell
me
who
thou
art
who
askest
before
i
tell
thee
who
i
am
who
am
asked
riding
here
on
common
land
quoth
the
knight
surlily
enough
i
am
hereward
without
whose
leave
no
man
has
ridden
the
bruneswald
for
many
a
and
i
am
letwold
the
englishman
who
rides
whither
he
will
in
merry
england
without
care
for
any
frenchman
upon
frenchman
why
callest
thou
me
frenchman
man
i
am
then
thou
art
if
tales
be
true
as
french
as
ivo
taillebois
i
hear
that
thou
hast
left
thy
true
lady
like
a
fool
and
a
churl
and
goest
to
london
or
winchester
or
the
nether
pit
i
care
not
which
to
make
thy
peace
with
the
the
man
was
a
surly
brute
but
what
he
said
was
so
true
that
hereward
s
wrath
arose
he
had
promised
torfrida
many
a
time
never
to
quarrel
with
an
englishman
but
to
endure
all
things
now
out
of
very
spite
to
torfrida
s
counsel
because
it
was
torfrida
s
and
he
had
promised
to
obey
it
he
took
up
the
quarrel
if
i
am
a
fool
and
a
churl
thou
art
a
greater
fool
to
provoke
thine
own
death
and
a
greater
spare
your
breath
said
the
big
man
and
let
me
try
hereward
as
i
have
many
whereon
they
dropped
their
and
rode
at
each
other
like
two
mad
bulls
and
by
the
contagion
of
folly
common
in
the
middle
age
at
each
other
rode
hereward
s
three
knights
and
letwold
s
five
the
two
leaders
found
themselves
both
rolling
on
the
ground
jumped
up
drew
their
swords
and
hewed
away
at
each
other
geri
unhorsed
his
man
at
the
first
charge
and
left
him
stunned
then
he
turned
on
another
and
did
the
same
by
him
wenoch
and
matelgar
each
upset
their
man
the
fifth
of
letwold
s
knights
threw
up
his
not
liking
his
new
company
geri
and
the
other
two
rode
in
on
the
two
chiefs
who
were
fighting
hard
each
under
shield
stand
back
roared
hereward
and
give
the
knight
fair
play
when
did
any
one
of
us
want
a
man
to
help
him
kill
or
die
single
has
been
our
rule
and
shall
they
threw
up
their
and
stood
round
to
see
that
great
fight
letwold
s
knight
rode
in
among
them
and
stood
likewise
and
friend
and
foe
looked
on
as
they
might
at
a
pair
of
hereward
had
to
his
own
surprise
and
that
of
his
fellows
met
his
match
the
sparks
flew
the
iron
clanged
but
so
heavy
were
the
stranger
s
strokes
that
hereward
reeled
again
and
again
so
sure
was
the
guard
of
his
shield
that
hereward
could
not
wound
him
hit
where
he
would
at
last
he
dealt
a
furious
blow
on
the
stranger
s
head
if
that
does
not
bring
your
master
down
quoth
geri
by
is
gone
it
was
too
true
sword
s
end
was
come
the
ogre
s
magic
blade
had
snapt
off
short
by
the
handle
your
master
is
a
true
englishman
by
the
hardness
of
his
brains
quoth
wenoch
as
the
stranger
reeling
for
a
moment
lifted
up
his
head
and
stared
at
hereward
in
the
face
doubtful
what
to
do
will
you
yield
or
fight
on
cried
he
yield
shouted
hereward
rushing
upon
him
as
a
mastiff
might
on
a
lion
and
striking
at
his
helm
though
shorter
than
him
by
a
head
and
shoulders
such
swift
and
terrible
blows
with
the
broken
hilt
as
staggered
the
tall
stranger
what
are
you
at
forgetting
what
you
have
at
your
side
roared
geri
hereward
sprang
back
he
had
as
was
his
custom
a
second
sword
on
his
right
thigh
i
forget
everything
now
said
he
to
himself
angrily
and
that
was
too
true
but
he
drew
the
second
sword
and
sprang
at
his
man
once
more
the
stranger
tried
according
to
the
chronicler
who
probably
had
it
from
one
of
the
three
a
blow
which
has
cost
many
a
brave
man
his
life
he
struck
right
down
on
hereward
s
head
hereward
raised
his
shield
warding
the
stroke
and
threw
in
that
de
which
there
is
no
guarding
after
the
downright
blow
has
been
given
the
stranger
dropped
upon
his
wounded
knee
yield
cried
hereward
in
his
turn
that
is
not
my
and
the
stranger
fought
on
upon
his
stumps
like
witherington
in
chevy
chase
hereward
mad
with
the
sight
of
blood
struck
at
him
four
or
five
times
the
stranger
s
shield
was
so
quick
that
he
could
not
hit
him
even
on
his
knee
he
held
his
hand
and
drew
back
looking
at
his
new
rival
what
the
murrain
are
we
two
fighting
about
said
he
at
last
i
know
not
neither
care
said
the
other
with
a
grim
chuckle
but
if
any
man
will
fight
me
him
i
fight
ever
since
i
had
beard
to
my
thou
art
the
best
man
that
ever
i
that
is
like
what
wilt
thou
take
if
i
give
thee
thy
life
my
way
on
which
i
was
going
for
i
turn
back
for
no
man
alive
on
then
thou
hast
not
had
enough
of
me
not
by
another
thou
must
be
born
of
fiend
and
not
of
very
like
it
is
a
wise
son
knows
his
own
hereward
burst
out
laughing
would
to
heaven
i
had
had
thee
for
my
man
this
three
years
perhaps
i
would
not
have
been
thy
why
not
because
i
have
been
my
own
man
ever
since
i
was
born
and
am
well
content
with
myself
for
my
shall
i
bind
up
thy
leg
asked
hereward
having
no
more
to
say
and
not
wishing
to
kill
the
man
no
it
will
grow
again
like
a
crab
s
thou
art
a
and
hereward
turned
away
sulky
and
half
afraid
very
like
no
man
knows
what
a
devil
he
is
till
he
what
dost
mean
and
hereward
turned
angrily
back
fiends
we
are
all
till
god
s
grace
little
grace
has
come
to
thee
yet
by
thy
ungracious
rough
to
men
may
be
gracious
to
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
women
asked
hereward
fiercely
i
have
a
wife
and
i
love
thou
art
not
like
to
get
back
to
her
i
fear
not
with
this
paltry
scratch
i
had
looked
for
a
cut
from
thee
would
have
saved
me
all
fighting
what
dost
mean
asked
hereward
with
an
oath
that
my
wife
is
in
heaven
and
i
would
needs
follow
hereward
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
away
never
could
he
find
out
who
that
sir
letwold
was
or
how
he
came
into
the
bruneswald
all
he
knew
was
that
he
never
had
had
such
a
fight
since
he
wore
beard
and
that
he
had
lost
sword
brainbiter
from
which
his
evil
conscience
augured
that
his
luck
had
turned
and
that
he
should
lose
many
things
beside
chapter
xxxviii
how
hereward
came
in
to
the
king
after
these
things
hereward
summoned
all
his
men
and
set
before
them
the
hopelessness
of
any
further
resistance
and
the
promises
of
amnesty
lands
and
honors
which
william
had
offered
him
and
persuaded
them
and
indeed
he
had
good
arguments
enough
and
to
spare
that
they
should
go
and
make
their
peace
with
the
king
they
were
so
accustomed
to
look
up
to
his
determination
that
when
it
gave
way
theirs
gave
way
likewise
they
were
so
accustomed
to
trust
his
wisdom
that
most
of
them
yielded
at
once
to
his
arguments
that
the
band
should
break
up
all
agreed
a
few
of
the
more
suspicious
or
more
desperate
said
that
they
could
never
trust
the
norman
that
hereward
himself
had
warned
them
again
and
again
of
his
treachery
that
he
was
now
going
to
do
himself
what
he
had
laughed
at
gospatrick
and
the
rest
for
doing
what
had
brought
ruin
on
edwin
and
morcar
what
he
had
again
and
again
prophesied
would
bring
ruin
on
waltheof
himself
ere
all
was
over
but
hereward
was
deaf
to
their
arguments
he
had
said
as
little
to
them
as
he
could
about
alftruda
for
very
shame
but
he
was
utterly
besotted
on
her
for
her
sake
he
had
determined
to
run
his
head
blindly
into
the
very
snare
of
which
he
had
warned
others
and
he
had
seared
so
he
fancied
his
conscience
it
was
torfrida
s
fault
now
not
his
if
she
left
him
if
she
herself
freed
him
of
her
own
will
why
he
was
free
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
about
it
and
hereward
says
the
chronicler
took
gwenoch
geri
and
matelgar
and
rode
south
to
the
king
where
were
the
two
young
siwards
it
is
not
said
probably
they
and
a
few
desperadoes
followed
the
fashion
of
so
many
english
in
those
sad
days
when
as
sings
the
norse
scald
cold
heart
and
bloody
hand
now
rule
english
land
and
took
ship
for
constantinople
and
enlisted
in
the
varanger
guard
and
died
full
of
years
and
honors
leaving
children
behind
them
to
become
varangers
in
their
turn
be
that
as
it
may
hereward
rode
south
but
when
he
had
gotten
a
long
way
upon
the
road
a
fancy
says
the
chronicler
came
over
him
he
was
not
going
in
pomp
and
glory
enough
it
seemed
mean
for
the
once
great
hereward
to
sneak
into
winchester
with
three
knights
perhaps
it
seemed
not
over
safe
for
the
once
great
hereward
to
travel
with
only
three
knights
so
he
went
back
all
the
way
to
camp
and
took
says
the
chronicler
forty
most
famous
knights
all
big
and
tall
of
stature
and
splendid
if
from
nothing
else
from
their
looks
and
their
harness
so
hereward
and
those
forty
knights
rode
down
from
peterborough
along
the
roman
road
for
the
roman
roads
were
then
and
for
centuries
after
the
only
roads
in
this
land
and
our
forefathers
looked
on
them
as
the
work
of
gods
and
giants
and
called
them
after
the
names
of
their
old
gods
and
heroes
irmen
street
watling
street
and
so
forth
and
then
like
true
englishmen
our
own
forefathers
showed
their
respect
for
the
said
divine
works
not
by
copying
them
but
by
picking
them
to
pieces
to
pave
every
man
his
own
be
it
so
the
neglect
of
new
roads
the
destruction
of
the
old
ones
was
a
natural
evil
consequence
of
local
a
cheap
price
perhaps
after
all
to
pay
for
that
power
of
local
which
has
kept
england
free
unto
this
day
be
that
as
it
may
down
the
roman
road
hereward
went
past
alconbury
hill
of
the
old
posting
days
past
wimpole
park
then
deep
forest
past
hatfield
then
deep
forest
likewise
and
so
to
alban
s
and
there
they
lodged
in
the
minster
for
the
monks
thereof
were
good
english
and
sang
masses
daily
for
king
harold
s
soul
and
the
next
day
they
went
south
by
ways
which
are
not
so
clear
just
outside
alban
s
verulamium
of
the
romans
the
ruins
whereof
were
believed
to
be
full
of
ghosts
demons
and
magic
treasures
they
turned
at
stephen
s
to
the
left
off
the
roman
road
to
london
and
by
another
roman
road
struck
into
the
vast
forest
which
ringed
london
round
from
northeast
to
southwest
following
the
upper
waters
of
the
colne
which
ran
through
the
woods
on
their
left
they
came
to
watford
and
then
turned
probably
to
rickmansworth
no
longer
on
the
roman
paved
ways
they
followed
between
the
forest
and
the
rich
of
the
colne
as
far
as
denham
and
then
struck
into
a
roman
road
again
at
the
north
end
of
langley
park
from
thence
over
heathy
commons
for
that
western
part
of
buckinghamshire
its
soil
being
light
and
some
gravel
was
little
cultivated
then
and
hardly
all
cultivated
now
they
held
on
straight
by
langley
town
into
the
vale
of
thames
little
they
dreamed
as
they
rode
down
by
ditton
green
off
the
heathy
commons
past
the
poor
scattered
farms
on
to
the
vast
rushy
meadows
while
upon
them
was
the
dull
weight
of
disappointment
shame
all
but
despair
their
race
enslaved
their
country
a
prey
to
strangers
and
all
its
future
like
their
own
a
lurid
blank
little
they
dreamed
of
what
that
vale
would
be
within
eight
hundred
years
the
eye
of
england
and
it
may
be
of
the
world
a
spot
which
owns
more
wealth
and
peace
more
art
and
civilization
more
beauty
and
more
virtue
it
may
be
than
any
of
god
s
gardens
which
make
fair
this
earth
windsor
on
its
crowned
steep
was
to
them
but
a
new
hunting
palace
of
the
old
edward
who
had
just
ruined
england
runnymede
a
mile
below
them
down
the
broad
stream
was
but
a
fringed
with
where
the
men
of
wessex
had
met
of
old
to
counsel
and
to
bring
the
country
to
this
pass
and
as
they
crossed
by
ford
or
the
shallows
of
old
windsor
whither
they
had
been
tending
all
along
and
struck
into
the
moorlands
of
wessex
itself
they
were
as
men
going
into
an
unknown
wilderness
behind
them
ruin
and
before
them
unknown
danger
on
through

which
runs
along

side
of
chobham

some
quarter
of
a
mile
broad
every
rut
and

as
fresh
at
this

as
when
the
ancient
briton
finding
that
his
neighbor
s
essedum
chariot
or
rather
cart
had
worn
the
ruts
too
deep
struck
out
a
fresh
wandering
line
for
himself
across
the
dreary
heath
over
the
blackwater
by
sandhurst
and
along
the
flats
of

where
the
old
ruts
show
the

this

down
into
the

forests
of

and
up
out
of
them
again
at
basing
on
to
the
clean
crisp
chalk
turf
to
strike
at
popham
lane
the
roman
road
from
silchester
and
hold
it
over
the
high
downs
till
they
saw
far
below
them
the
royal
city
of
winchester
itchen
silver
as
they
looked
on
her
from
above
but
when
they
came
down
to
her
so
clear
that
none
could
see
where
water
ended
and
where
air
began
hurried
through
the
city
in
many
a
stream
beyond
it
rose
the
white
camp
the
venta

the
circular
earthwork
of
white
chalk
on
the
high
down
within
the
city
rose

ancient

built
by
ethelwold

even
then
where
slept
the
ancient
kings
kennulf
egbert
and
ethelwulf
the
saxons
and
by
them
the
danes
canute
the
great
and
hardicanute
his
son
and
norman
emma
his
wife
and
ethelred
s
before
him
and
the
great
earl
godwin
who
seemed
to
hereward
to
have
died
not
twenty
but
two
hundred
years
ago
and
it
may
be
an
old
saxon
hall
upon
the
little
isle
whither
edgar
had
bidden
bring
the
heads
of
all
the
wolves
in
wessex
where
afterwards
the
bishops
built
wolvesey
palace
but
nearer
to
them
on
the
down
which
sloped
up
to
the
west
stood
an
uglier
thing
which
they
saw
with
curses
deep
and
loud
the
keep
of
the
new
norman
castle
by
the
west
gate
hereward
halted
his
knights
upon
the
down
outside
the
northern
gate
then
he
rode
forward
himself
the
gate
was
open
wide
but
he
did
not
care
to
go
in
so
he
rode
into
the
gateway
and
smote
upon
that
gate
with
his
but
the
porter
saw
the
knights
upon
the
down
and
was
afraid
to
come
out
for
he
feared
treason
then
hereward
smote
a
second
time
but
the
porter
did
not
come
out
then
he
took
the
lance
by
the
shaft
and
smote
a
third
time
and
he
smote
so
hard
that
the
flew
to
flinders
against
winchester
gate
and
at
that
started
out
two
knights
who
had
come
down
from
the
castle
seeing
the
meinie
on
the
down
and
asked
who
art
thou
who
knockest
here
so
bold
who
i
am
any
man
can
see
by
those
splinters
if
he
knows
what
men
are
left
in
england
this
the
knights
looked
at
the
broken
wood
and
then
at
each
other
who
could
the
man
be
who
could
beat
an
ash
stave
to
flinders
at
a
single
blow
you
are
young
and
do
not
know
me
and
no
shame
to
you
go
and
tell
william
the
king
that
hereward
is
come
to
put
his
hands
between
the
king
s
and
be
the
king
s
man
you
are
hereward
asked
one
half
awed
half
disbelieving
at
hereward
s
short
stature
you
are
i
know
not
who
pick
up
those
splinters
and
take
them
to
king
william
and
say
the
man
who
broke
that
lance
against
the
gate
is
here
to
make
his
peace
with
thee
and
he
will
know
who
i
and
so
cowed
were
these
two
knights
with
hereward
s
royal
voice
and
royal
eye
and
royal
strength
that
they
went
simply
and
did
what
he
bade
them
and
when
king
william
saw
the
splinters
he
was
as
joyful
as
man
could
be
and
said
send
him
to
me
and
tell
him
bright
shines
the
sun
to
me
that
lights
hereward
into
but
lord
king
he
has
with
him
a
meinie
of
full
forty
so
much
the
better
i
shall
have
the
more
valiant
englishmen
to
help
my
valiant
so
hereward
rode
round
outside
the
walls
to
william
s
new
entrenched
palace
outside
the
west
gate
by
the
castle
and
then
hereward
went
in
and
knelt
before
the
norman
and
put
his
hands
between
william
s
hands
and
swore
to
be
his
man
i
have
kept
my
word
said
he
which
i
sent
to
thee
at
rouen
seven
years
agone
thou
art
king
of
all
england
and
i
am
the
last
man
to
say
and
since
thou
hast
said
it
i
am
king
indeed
come
with
me
and
dine
and
i
will
see
thy
and
william
walked
out
of
the
hall
leaning
on
hereward
s
shoulder
at
which
all
the
normans
gnashed
their
teeth
with
envy
and
for
my
knights
lord
king
thine
and
mine
will
mix
for
a
while
yet
like
oil
and
water
and
i
fear
lest
there
be
murder
done
between
likely
so
the
knights
were
bestowed
in
a
vill
near
by
and
the
next
day
the
venerable
king
himself
went
forth
to
see
those
knights
and
caused
them
to
stand
and
march
before
him
both
with
arms
and
without
with
whom
being
much
delighted
he
praised
them
congratulating
them
on
their
beauty
and
stature
and
saying
that
they
must
all
be
knights
of
fame
in
after
which
hereward
sent
them
all
home
except
two
and
waited
till
he
should
marry
alftruda
and
get
back
his
heritage
and
when
that
happens
said
william
why
should
we
not
have
two
weddings
beausire
as
well
as
one
i
hear
that
you
have
in
crowland
a
fair
daughter
and
hereward
bowed
and
i
have
found
a
husband
for
her
suitable
to
her
years
and
who
may
conduce
to
your
peace
and
hereward
bit
his
lip
to
refuse
was
impossible
in
those
days
but
i
trust
that
your
grace
has
found
a
knight
of
higher
lineage
than
him
whom
after
so
many
honors
you
honored
with
the
hand
of
my
william
laughed
it
was
not
his
interest
to
quarrel
with
hereward
aha
ivo
the
s
son
i
ask
your
pardon
for
that
sir
hereward
had
you
been
my
man
then
as
you
are
now
it
might
have
been
if
a
king
ask
my
pardon
i
can
only
ask
his
in
you
must
be
friends
with
taillebois
he
is
a
brave
knight
and
a
wise
none
ever
doubted
and
to
cover
any
little
blots
in
his
escutcheon
i
have
made
him
an
earl
as
i
may
make
you
some
your
majesty
like
a
true
king
knows
how
to
reward
who
is
this
knight
whom
you
have
chosen
for
my
lass
sir
hugh
of
evermue
a
neighbor
of
yours
and
a
man
of
blood
and
i
know
him
and
his
lineage
and
it
is
very
well
i
humbly
thank
your
can
i
be
the
same
man
said
hereward
to
himself
bitterly
and
he
was
not
the
same
man
he
was
besotted
on
alftruda
and
humbled
himself
accordingly
chapter
xxxix
how
torfrida
confessed
that
she
had
been
inspired
by
the
devil
after
a
few
days
there
came
down
a
priest
to
crowland
and
talked
with
torfrida
in
archbishop
lanfranc
s
name
whether
lanfranc
sent
him
or
merely
as
is
probable
alftruda
he
could
not
have
come
in
a
more
fit
name
torfrida
knew
with
all
the
world
how
lanfranc
had
arranged
william
the
norman
s
uncanonical
marriage
with
the
pope
by
help
of
archdeacon
hildebrand
afterwards
pope
himself
and
had
changed
his
mind
deftly
to
william
s
side
when
he
saw
that
william
might
be
useful
to
holy
church
and
could
enslave
if
duly
managed
not
only
the
nation
of
england
to
himself
but
the
clergy
of
england
to
rome
all
this
torfrida
and
the
world
knew
and
therefore
she
answered
lanfranc
i
can
hardly
credit
you
for
i
hear
that
he
is
a
good
man
though
hard
but
he
has
settled
a
queen
s
marriage
suit
so
he
may
very
well
settle
after
which
they
talked
together
and
she
answered
him
the
priest
said
so
wisely
and
well
that
he
never
had
met
with
a
woman
of
so
clear
a
brain
or
of
so
stout
a
heart
at
last
being
puzzled
to
get
that
which
he
wanted
he
touched
on
the
matter
of
her
marriage
with
hereward
she
wished
it
he
said
dissolved
she
wished
herself
to
enter
religion
archbishop
lanfranc
would
be
most
happy
to
sanction
so
holy
a
desire
but
there
were
objections
she
was
a
married
woman
and
her
husband
had
not
given
his
consent
let
him
give
it
there
were
still
objections
he
had
nothing
to
bring
against
her
which
could
justify
the
dissolution
of
the
holy
bond
unless
unless
i
bring
some
myself
there
have
been
rumors
i
say
not
how
true
of
magic
and
sorcery
torfrida
leaped
up
from
her
seat
and
laughed
such
a
laugh
that
the
priest
said
in
after
years
it
rung
through
his
head
as
if
it
had
arisen
out
of
the
pit
of
the
lost
so
that
is
what
you
want
churchman
then
you
shall
have
it
bring
me
pen
and
ink
i
need
not
to
confess
to
you
you
shall
read
my
confession
when
it
is
done
i
am
a
better
scribe
mind
you
than
any
clerk
between
here
and
she
seized
the
pen
and
ink
and
wrote
not
fiercely
as
the
priest
expected
but
slowly
and
carefully
then
she
gave
it
the
priest
to
read
will
that
do
churchman
will
that
free
my
soul
and
that
of
your
french
archbishop
and
the
priest
read
to
himself
how
torfrida
of
omer
born
at
aries
in
provence
confest
that
from
her
youth
up
she
had
been
given
to
the
practice
of
diabolic
arts
and
had
at
divers
times
and
places
used
the
same
both
alone
and
with
richilda
late
countess
of
hainault
how
wickedly
wantonly
and
instinct
with
a
malignant
spirit
she
had
compassed
by
charms
and
spells
to
win
the
love
of
hereward
how
she
had
ever
since
kept
in
bondage
him
and
others
whom
she
had
not
loved
with
the
same
carnal
love
but
only
desired
to
make
them
useful
to
her
own
desire
of
power
and
glory
by
the
same
magical
arts
for
which
she
now
humbly
begged
pardon
of
holy
church
and
of
all
christian
folk
and
penetrated
with
compunction
desired
only
that
she
might
retire
into
the
convent
of
crowland
she
asserted
the
marriage
which
she
had
so
unlawfully
compassed
to
be
null
and
void
and
prayed
to
be
released
therefrom
as
a
burden
to
her
conscience
and
soul
that
she
might
spend
the
rest
of
her
life
in
penitence
for
her
many
enormous
sins
she
submitted
herself
to
the
judgment
of
holy
church
only
begging
that
this
her
free
confession
might
be
counted
in
her
favor
and
that
she
might
not
be
put
to
death
as
she
deserved
nor
sent
into
perpetual
imprisonment
because
her
according
to
the
flesh
the
countess
godiva
being
old
and
infirm
had
daily
need
of
her
and
she
wished
to
serve
her
menially
as
long
as
she
lived
after
which
she
put
herself
utterly
upon
the
judgment
of
the
church
and
meanwhile
she
desired
and
prayed
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
remain
at
large
in
the
said
monastery
of
crowland
not
leaving
the
precincts
thereof
without
special
leave
given
by
the
abbot
and
prioress
in
one
case
between
her
and
them
reserved
to
wear
garments
of
to
fast
all
the
year
on
bread
and
water
and
to
be
disciplined
with
rods
or
otherwise
at
such
times
as
the
prioress
should
command
and
to
such
degree
as
her
body
softened
with
carnal
luxury
could
reasonably
endure
and
beyond
that
being
dead
to
the
world
god
might
have
mercy
on
her
soul
and
she
meant
what
she
said
the
madness
of
remorse
and
disappointment
so
common
in
the
wild
middle
age
had
come
over
her
and
with
it
the
twin
madness
of
the
priest
read
and
trembled
not
for
torfrida
but
for
himself
lest
she
should
enchant
him
after
all
she
must
have
been
an
awful
sinner
said
he
to
the
monks
when
he
got
safe
out
of
the
room
comparable
only
to
the
witch
of
endor
or
the
woman
jezebel
of
whom
john
writes
in
the
i
do
not
know
how
you
frenchmen
measure
folks
when
you
see
them
but
to
our
mind
she
is
for
goodness
humility
and
patience
comparable
only
to
an
angel
of
god
said
abbot
ulfketyl
you
englishmen
will
have
to
change
your
minds
on
many
points
if
you
mean
to
stay
we
shall
not
change
them
and
we
shall
stay
here
quoth
the
abbot
how
you
will
not
get
sweyn
and
his
danes
to
help
you
a
second
no
we
shall
all
die
and
give
you
your
wills
and
you
will
not
have
the
heart
to
cast
our
bones
into
the
fens
not
unless
you
intend
to
work
miracles
and
set
up
for
saints
like
your
alphege
heaven
forbid
that
we
should
compare
ourselves
with
them
only
let
us
alone
till
we
if
you
let
us
alone
and
do
not
turn
traitor
abbot
ulfketyl
bit
his
lip
and
kept
down
the
rising
fiend
and
now
said
the
priest
deliver
me
over
torfrida
the
younger
daughter
of
hereward
and
this
woman
that
i
may
take
her
to
the
king
who
has
found
a
fit
husband
for
you
will
hardly
get
not
get
her
not
without
her
mother
s
consent
the
lass
cares
for
naught
but
pish
that
sorceress
send
for
the
abbot
ulfketyl
forced
in
his
own
abbey
great
and
august
lord
though
he
was
to
obey
any
upstart
of
a
norman
priest
who
came
backed
by
the
king
and
lanfranc
sent
for
the
lass
the
young
outlaw
came
in
hawk
on
fist
and
its
hood
off
for
it
was
a
pet
short
sturdy
upright
with
hard
hands
and
face
but
with
the
of
her
father
and
her
mother
and
the
hawks
among
which
she
was
bred
she
looked
the
priest
over
from
head
to
foot
till
he
was
abashed
a
frenchman
said
she
and
she
said
no
more
the
priest
looked
at
her
eyes
and
then
at
the
hawk
s
eyes
they
were
disagreeably
like
each
other
he
told
his
errand
as
courteously
as
he
could
for
he
was
not
a
man
for
a
norman
priest
the
lass
laughed
him
to
scorn
the
king
s
commands
she
never
saw
a
king
in
the
greenwood
and
cared
for
none
there
was
no
king
in
england
now
since
sweyn
ulfsson
sailed
back
to
denmark
who
was
this
norman
william
to
sell
a
free
english
lass
like
a
colt
or
a
cow
the
priest
might
go
back
to
the
slaves
of
wessex
and
command
them
if
he
could
but
in
the
fens
men
were
free
and
lasses
too
the
priest
was
piously
shocked
and
indignant
and
began
to
argue
she
played
with
her
hawk
instead
of
listening
and
then
was
marching
out
of
the
room
your
mother
said
he
is
a
you
are
a
knave
or
set
on
by
knaves
you
lie
and
you
know
you
and
she
turned
away
again
she
has
confessed
you
have
driven
her
mad
between
you
till
she
will
confess
anything
i
presume
you
threatened
to
burn
her
as
some
of
you
did
awhile
and
the
young
lady
made
use
of
words
equally
strong
and
true
the
priest
was
not
accustomed
to
the
direct
language
of
the
greenwood
and
indignant
on
his
own
account
threatened
and
finally
offered
to
use
force
whereon
there
looked
up
into
his
face
such
a
demon
so
he
said
as
he
never
had
seen
or
dreamed
of
and
said
if
you
lay
a
finger
on
me
i
will
brittle
you
like
any
and
therewith
pulled
out
a
about
half
as
long
again
as
the
said
priest
s
hand
being
very
sharp
so
he
deposed
down
the
whole
length
of
one
edge
and
likewise
down
his
little
finger
s
length
of
the
other
not
being
versed
in
the
terms
of
english
venery
he
asked
abbot
ulfketyl
what
brittling
of
a
deer
might
mean
and
being
informed
that
it
was
that
operation
on
the
carcass
of
a
stag
which
his
countrymen
called
and
highland
gillies
now
gralloching
he
subsided
and
thought
it
best
to
go
and
consult
the
young
lady
s
mother
she
to
his
astonishment
submitted
at
once
and
utterly
the
king
and
he
whom
she
had
called
her
husband
were
very
gracious
it
was
all
well
she
would
have
preferred
and
the
lady
godiva
too
after
their
experience
of
the
world
and
the
flesh
to
have
devoted
her
daughter
to
heaven
in
the
minster
there
but
she
was
unworthy
who
was
she
to
train
a
bride
for
him
who
died
on
cross
she
accepted
this
as
part
of
her
penance
with
thankfulness
and
humility
she
had
heard
that
sir
hugh
of
evermue
was
a
gentleman
of
ancient
birth
and
good
prowess
and
she
thanked
the
king
for
his
choice
let
the
priest
tell
her
daughter
that
she
commanded
her
to
go
with
him
to
winchester
she
did
not
wish
to
see
her
she
was
stained
with
many
crimes
and
unworthy
to
approach
a
pure
maiden
besides
it
would
only
cause
misery
and
tears
she
was
trying
to
die
to
the
world
and
to
the
flesh
and
she
did
not
wish
to
reawaken
their
power
within
her
yes
it
was
very
well
let
the
lass
go
with
thou
art
indeed
a
true
penitent
said
the
priest
his
human
heart
softening
him
thou
art
very
much
mistaken
said
she
and
turned
away
the
girl
when
she
heard
her
mother
s
command
wept
shrieked
and
went
at
least
she
was
going
to
her
father
and
from
wholesome
fear
of
that
same
the
priest
left
her
in
peace
all
the
way
to
winchester
after
which
abbot
ulfketyl
went
into
his
lodgings
and
burst
like
a
noble
old
nobleman
as
he
was
into
bitter
tears
of
rage
and
shame
but
torfrida
s
eyes
were
as
dry
as
her
own
sackcloth
the
priest
took
the
letter
back
to
winchester
and
showed
it
it
may
be
to
archbishop
lanfranc
but
what
he
said
this
chronicler
would
not
dare
to
say
for
he
was
a
very
wise
man
and
a
very
stanch
and
strong
pillar
of
the
holy
roman
church
meanwhile
he
was
man
enough
not
to
require
that
anything
should
be
added
to
torfrida
s
penance
and
that
was
enough
to
prove
him
a
man
in
those
days
at
least
for
a
churchman
as
it
proved
archbishop
or
ailred
to
be
a
few
years
after
in
the
case
of
the
nun
of
watton
to
be
read
in
gale
s
scriptores
then
he
showed
the
letter
to
alftruda
and
she
laughed
one
of
her
laughs
and
said
i
have
her
at
last
then
as
it
befell
he
was
forced
to
shew
the
letter
to
queen
matilda
and
she
wept
over
it
human
tears
such
as
she
the
noble
heart
had
been
forced
to
keep
many
a
time
before
and
said
the
poor
soul
you
alftruda
woman
does
hereward
know
of
this
no
madam
said
alftruda
not
adding
that
she
had
taken
good
care
that
he
should
not
know
it
is
the
best
thing
which
i
have
heard
of
him
i
should
tell
him
were
it
not
that
i
must
not
meddle
with
my
lord
s
plans
god
grant
him
a
good
delivery
as
they
say
of
the
poor
souls
in
jail
well
madam
you
have
your
will
at
last
god
give
you
grace
thereof
for
you
have
not
given
him
much
chance
as
your
majesty
will
honor
us
by
coming
to
the
wedding
asked
alftruda
utterly
unabashed
matilda
the
good
looked
at
her
with
a
face
of
such
calm
childlike
astonishment
that
alftruda
dropped
her
fairy
neck
at
last
and
slunk
out
of
the
presence
like
a
beaten
cur
william
went
to
the
wedding
and
swore
horrible
oaths
that
they
were
the
handsomest
pair
he
had
ever
seen
and
so
hereward
married
alftruda
how
holy
church
settled
the
matter
is
not
said
but
that
hereward
married
alftruda
under
these
very
circumstances
may
be
considered
a
historic
fact
being
vouched
for
by
gaimar
and
by
the
peterborough
chronicler
and
doubtless
holy
church
contrived
that
it
should
happen
without
sin
if
it
conduced
to
her
own
interest
and
little
torfrida
then
it
seems
some
sixteen
years
of
age
was
married
to
hugh
of
evermue
she
wept
and
struggled
as
she
was
dragged
into
the
church
but
i
do
not
want
to
be
married
i
want
to
go
back
to
my
the
diabolic
instinct
may
have
descended
to
her
said
the
priests
and
attracts
her
to
the
sorceress
we
had
best
sprinkle
her
with
holy
so
they
sprinkled
her
with
holy
water
and
used
exorcisms
indeed
the
case
being
an
important
one
the
personages
of
rank
they
brought
out
from
their
treasures
the
apron
of
a
certain
virgin

was
according
to

a

therefore
doubtless
a

man

offered
to
strike
her
as
was
the
fashion
in
those
chivalrous
days
whereon
she
turned
upon
him
like
a
tigress
and
bidding
him
remember
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
hereward
and
torfrida
gave
him
such
a
beating
that
he
not
wishing
to
draw
sword
upon
her
surrendered
at
discretion

with

not
knowing

deservedly
so
why
should
he

again
why
not
unless
it
be
true
that
the
wages
of
sin
are
not
a
new
life
but
death
and
yet
he
has
his

has

him
for
turning
him
out
of

he
had
comfortably
held
for
two
years
past

sending

him
for

ivo

him
for
existing

only
gilbert
of
ghent
the
pious
and
illustrious
earl
sent
messages
of
congratulation
and
friendship
to
hereward
it
being
his
custom
to
sail
with
the
wind
and
worship
the
rising
sun
till
it
should
decline
again
but
more
hardly
one
of
the
normans
round
but
in
the
conceit
of
their
yesterday
s
civilization
look
on
hereward
as
a
barbarian
englishman
who
has
his
throat
tattooed
and
wears
a
short
coat
and
prefers
the
churl
to
talk
english
in
his
own
hall
though
he
can
talk
as
good
french
as
they
when
he
is
with
them
beside
three
or
four
barbarian
tongues
if
he
has
need
but
more
still
if
they
are
not
likely
to
bestow
their
love
on
hereward
hereward
is
not
likely
to
win
love
from
them
of
his
own
will
he
is
peevish
and
wrathful
often
insolent
and
quarrelsome
and
small
blame
to
him
the
normans
are
invaders
and
tyrants
who
have
no
business
there
and
should
not
be
there
if
he
had
his
way
and
they
and
he
can
no
more
amalgamate
than
fire
and
water
moreover
he
is
a
very
great
man
or
has
been
such
once
and
he
thinks
himself
one
still
he
has
been
accustomed
to
command
men
whole
armies
and
he
will
no
more
treat
these
normans
as
his
equals
than
they
will
treat
him
as
such
his
own
hugh
of
evermue
has
to
take
hard
words
thoroughly
well
deserved
it
may
be
but
all
the
more
unpleasant
for
that
reason
the
truth
was
that
hereward
s
heart
was
gnawed
with
shame
and
remorse
and
therefore
he
fancied
and
not
without
reason
that
all
men
pointed
at
him
the
finger
of
scorn
he
had
done
a
bad
base
accursed
deed
and
he
knew
it
once
in
his
life
for
his
other
sins
were
but
the
sins
of
his
age
the
father
of
men
seems
if
the
chroniclers
say
truth
to
have
put
before
this
splendid
barbarian
good
and
evil
saying
choose
and
he
knew
that
the
evil
was
evil
and
chose
it
nevertheless
eight
hundred
years
after
a
still
greater
genius
and
general
had
the
same
choice
as
far
as
human
cases
of
conscience
can
be
alike
put
before
him
and
he
chose
as
hereward
chose
but
as
with
napoleon
and
josephine
so
it
was
with
hereward
and
torfrida
neither
throve
after
it
was
not
punished
by
miracle
what
sin
is
it
worked
out
its
own
punishment
that
which
it
merited
deserved
or
earned
by
its
own
labor
no
man
could
commit
such
a
sin
without
shaking
his
whole
character
to
the
root
hereward
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
his
was
not
shaken
that
he
was
the
same
hereward
as
ever
but
he
could
not
deceive
himself
long
his
conscience
was
evil
he
was
discontented
with
all
mankind
and
with
himself
most
of
all
he
tried
to
be
good
as
good
as
he
chose
to
be
if
he
had
done
wrong
in
one
thing
he
might
make
up
for
it
in
others
but
he
could
not
all
his
higher
instincts
fell
from
him
one
by
one
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
good
and
noble
things
he
dared
not
think
of
them
he
felt
not
at
first
but
as
the
months
rolled
on
that
he
was
a
changed
man
that
god
had
left
him
his
old
bad
habits
began
to
return
to
him
gradually
he
sank
back
into
the
very
vices
from
which
torfrida
had
raised
him
sixteen
years
before
he
took
to
drinking
again
to
dull
the
malady
of
thought
he
excused
himself
to
himself
he
wished
to
forget
his
defeats
his
disappointment
the
ruin
of
his
country
the
splendid
past
which
lay
behind
him
like
a
dream
true
but
he
wished
to
forget
likewise
torfrida
fasting
and
weeping
in
crowland
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
crowland
tower
on
the
far
green
horizon
the
sound
of
crowland
bells
booming
over
the
flat
on
the
he
never
rode
down
into
the
fens
he
never
went
to
see
his
daughter
at
deeping
because
crowland
lay
that
way
he
went
up
into
the
old
bruneswald
hunted
all
day
long
through
the
glades
where
he
and
his
merry
men
had
done
their
doughty
deeds
and
came
home
in
the
evening
to
get
drunk
then
he
lost
his
sleep
he
sent
down
to
crowland
to
leofric
the
priest
that
he
might
come
to
him
and
sing
his
sagas
of
the
old
heroes
that
he
might
get
rest
but
leofric
sent
back
for
answer
that
he
would
not
come
that
night
alftruda
heard
him
by
her
side
in
the
still
hours
weeping
silently
to
himself
she
caressed
him
but
he
gave
no
heed
to
her
i
believe
said
she
bitterly
at
last
that
you
love
torfrida
still
better
than
you
do
and
hereward
answered
like
mahomet
in
like
case
that
do
i
by
heaven
she
believed
in
me
when
no
one
else
in
the
world
and
the
vain
hard
alftruda
answered
angrily
and
there
was
many
a
fierce
quarrel
between
them
after
that
with
his
love
of
drinking
his
love
of
boasting
came
back
because
he
could
do
no
more
great
deeds
or
rather
had
not
the
spirit
left
in
him
to
do
more
he
must
needs
like
a
old
man
babble
of
the
great
deeds
which
he
had
done
insult
and
defy
his
norman
neighbors
often
talk
what
might
be
easily
caricatured
into
treason
against
king
william
himself
there
were
great
excuses
for
his
follies
as
there
are
for
those
of
every
beaten
man
but
hereward
was
spent
he
had
lived
his
life
and
had
no
more
life
which
he
could
live
for
every
man
it
would
seem
brings
into
the
world
with
him
a
certain
capacity
a
certain
amount
of
vital
force
in
body
and
in
soul
and
when
that
is
used
up
the
man
must
sink
down
into
some
sort
of
second
childhood
and
end
like
hereward
very
much
where
he
began
unless
the
grace
of
god
shall
lift
him
up
above
the
capacity
of
the
mere
flesh
into
a
life
literally
new
and
eternal
but
the
grace
of
god
had
gone
away
from
hereward
as
it
goes
away
from
all
men
who
are
unfaithful
to
their
wives
it
was
very
pitiable
let
no
man
judge
him
life
to
most
is
very
hard
work
there
are
those
who
endure
to
the
end
and
are
saved
there
are
those
again
who
do
not
endure
upon
whose
souls
may
god
have
mercy
so
hereward
soon
became
as
intolerable
to
his
norman
neighbors
as
they
were
intolerable
to
him
whereon
according
to
the
simple
fashion
of
those
primitive
times
they
sought
about
for
some
one
who
would
pick
a
quarrel
with
hereward
and
slay
him
in
fair
fight
but
an
archibald
was
not
to
be
found
on
every
hedge
but
it
befell
that
oger
the
breton
he
who
had
morcar
s
lands
round
bourne
came
up
to
see
after
his
lands
and
to
visit
his
friend
and
ivo
taillebois
ivo
thought
the
breton
who
had
already
insulted
hereward
with
impunity
at
winchester
the
fittest
man
for
his
purpose
and
asked
him
over
his
cups
whether
he
had
settled
with
that
english
ruffian
about
the
docton
land
now
king
william
had
judged
that
hereward
and
oger
should
hold
that
land
between
them
as
he
and
toli
had
done
but
when
two
dogs
as
ivo
said
have
hold
of
the
same
bone
it
is
hard
if
they
can
not
get
a
snap
at
each
other
s
oger
agreed
to
that
opinion
and
riding
into
bourne
made
inquisition
into
the
doings
at
docton
and
scandalous
injustice
he
found
that
an
old
woman
had
sent
six
hens
to
hereward
whereof
she
should
have
kept
three
for
him
so
he
sent
to
demand
formally
of
hereward
those
three
hens
and
was
unpleasantly
disappointed
when
hereward
instead
of
offering
to
fight
him
sent
him
them
in
an
hour
and
a
lusty
young
cock
into
the
bargain
with
this
message
that
he
hoped
they
might
increase
and
multiply
for
it
was
a
shame
of
an
honest
englishman
if
he
did
not
help
a
poor
breton
churl
to
eat
roast
fowls
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
after
feeding
on
nothing
better
than
like
his
own
ponies
to
which
oger
who
like
a
true
breton
believed
himself
descended
from
king
arthur
sir
tristram
and
half
the
knights
of
the
round
table
replied
that
his
blood
was
to
that
of
hereward
as
wine
to
and
that
bretons
used
only
to
scourge
the
backs
of
insolent
barbarians
to
which
hereward
replied
that
there
were
gnats
enough
pestering
him
in
the
fens
already
and
that
one
more
was
of
no
consequence
wherefrom
the
breton
judged
as
at
winchester
that
hereward
had
no
lust
to
fight
the
next
day
he
met
hereward
going
out
to
hunt
and
was
confirmed
in
his
opinion
when
hereward
lifted
his
cap
to
him
most
courteously
saying
that
he
was
not
aware
before
that
his
neighbor
was
a
gentleman
of
such
high
blood
blood
better
at
least
than
thine
thou
saxon
who
has
dared
to
call
me
churl
so
you
must
needs
have
your
throat
cut
i
took
you
for
a
wiser
many
have
taken
me
for
that
which
i
am
not
if
you
will
harness
yourself
i
will
do
the
same
and
we
will
ride
up
into
the
bruneswald
and
settle
this
matter
in
three
men
on
each
side
to
see
fair
play
said
the
breton
and
up
into
the
bruneswald
they
rode
and
fought
long
without
advantage
on
either
side
hereward
was
not
the
man
which
he
had
been
his
nerve
was
gone
as
well
as
his
conscience
and
all
the
dash
and
fury
of
his
old
onslaughts
gone
therewith
he
grew
tired
of
the
fight
not
in
body
but
in
mind
and
more
than
once
drew
back
let
us
stop
this
child
s
play
said
he
according
to
the
chronicler
what
need
have
we
to
fight
here
all
day
about
nothing
whereat
the
breton
fancied
him
already
more
than
and
attacked
more
furiously
than
ever
he
would
be
the
first
man
on
earth
who
ever
had
had
the
better
of
the
great
outlaw
he
would
win
himself
eternal
glory
as
the
champion
of
all
england
but
he
had
mistaken
his
man
and
his
indomitable
english
pluck
it
was
hereward
s
fashion
in
fight
and
war
says
the
chronicler
always
to
ply
the
man
most
at
the
and
so
found
the
breton
for
hereward
suddenly
lost
patience
and
rushing
on
him
with
one
of
his
old
shouts
hewed
at
him
again
and
again
as
if
his
arm
would
never
tire
oger
gave
back
would
he
or
not
in
a
few
moments
his
dropt
to
his
side
cut
half
through
have
you
had
enough
sir
tristram
the
younger
quoth
hereward
wiping
his
sword
and
walking
moodily
away
oger
went
out
of
bourne
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
took
counsel
with
ivo
taillebois
whereon
they
two
mounted
and
rode
to
lincoln
and
took
counsel
with
gilbert
of
ghent
the
fruit
of
which
was
this
that
a
fortnight
after
gilbert
rode
into
bourne
with
a
great
meinie
full
a
hundred
strong
and
with
him
the
sheriff
and
the
king
s
writ
and
arrested
hereward
on
a
charge
of
speaking
evil
of
the
king
breaking
his
peace
compassing
the
death
of
his
faithful
lieges
and
various
other
wicked
traitorous
and
diabolical
acts
hereward
was
minded
at
first
to
fight
and
die
but
gilbert
who
to
do
him
justice
wished
no
harm
to
his
ancient
squire
reasoned
with
him
why
should
he
destroy
not
only
himself
but
perhaps
his
people
likewise
why
should
he
throw
away
his
last
chance
the
king
was
not
so
angry
as
he
seemed
and
if
hereward
would
but
be
reasonable
the
matter
might
be
arranged
as
it
was
he
was
not
to
be
put
to
strong
prison
he
was
to
be
in
the
custody
of
robert
of
herepol
châtelain
of
bedford
who
hereward
knew
was
a
reasonable
and
courteous
man
the
king
had
asked
him
gilbert
to
take
charge
of
hereward
and
what
said
you
that
i
had
rather
have
in
my
pocket
the
seven
devils
that
came
out
of
mary
magdalene
and
that
i
would
not
have
thee
within
ten
miles
of
lincoln
town
to
be
earl
of
all
the
danelagh
so
i
begged
him
to
send
thee
to
sir
robert
just
because
i
knew
him
to
be
a
mild
and
gracious
a
year
before
hereward
would
have
scorned
the
proposal
and
probably
by
one
of
his
famous
stratagems
escaped
there
and
then
out
of
the
midst
of
all
gilbert
s
men
but
his
spirit
was
broken
indeed
so
was
the
spirit
of
every
englishman
and
he
mounted
his
horse
sullenly
and
rode
alongside
of
gilbert
unarmed
for
the
first
time
for
many
a
year
you
had
better
have
taken
me
said
sir
ascelin
aside
to
the
weeping
alftruda
i
helpless
wretch
that
i
am
what
shall
i
do
for
my
own
safety
now
he
is
gone
let
me
come
and
provide
for
out
wretch
traitor
cried
she
there
is
nothing
very
traitorous
in
succoring
distressed
ladies
said
ascelin
if
i
can
be
of
the
least
service
to
alftruda
the
peerless
let
her
but
send
and
i
fly
to
do
her
so
they
rode
off
hereward
went
through
cambridge
and
potton
like
a
man
stunned
and
spoke
never
a
word
he
could
not
even
think
till
he
heard
the
key
turned
on
him
in
a
room
not
a
small
or
doleful
one
in
bedford
keep
and
found
an
iron
shackle
on
his
leg
fastened
to
the
stone
bench
on
which
he
sat
robert
of
herepol
had
meant
to
leave
his
prisoner
loose
but
there
were
those
in
gilbert
s
train
who
told
him
and
with
truth
that
if
he
did
so
no
man
s
life
would
be
safe
that
to
brain
the
jailer
with
his
own
keys
and
then
twist
out
of
his
bowels
a
line
wherewith
to
let
himself
down
from
the
top
of
the
castle
would
be
not
only
easy
but
amusing
to
the
famous
so
robert
consented
to
fetter
him
so
far
but
no
further
and
begged
his
pardon
again
and
again
as
he
did
it
pleading
the
painful
necessities
of
his
office
but
hereward
heard
him
not
he
sat
in
stupefied
despair
a
great
black
cloud
had
covered
all
heaven
and
earth
and
entered
into
his
brain
through
every
sense
till
his
mind
as
he
said
afterwards
was
like
hell
with
the
fire
gone
out
a
jailer
came
in
he
knew
not
how
long
after
bringing
a
good
meal
and
wine
he
came
cautiously
toward
the
prisoner
and
when
still
beyond
the
length
of
his
chain
set
the
food
down
and
thrust
it
toward
him
with
a
stick
lest
hereward
should
leap
on
him
and
wring
his
neck
but
hereward
never
even
saw
him
or
the
food
he
sat
there
all
day
all
night
and
nearly
all
the
next
day
and
hardly
moved
hand
or
foot
the
jailer
told
sir
robert
in
the
evening
that
he
thought
the
man
was
mad
and
would
die
so
good
sir
robert
went
up
to
him
and
spoke
kindly
and
hopefully
but
all
hereward
answered
was
that
he
was
very
well
that
he
wanted
nothing
that
he
had
always
heard
well
of
sir
robert
that
he
should
like
to
get
a
little
sleep
but
that
sleep
would
not
come
the
next
day
sir
robert
came
again
early
and
found
him
sitting
in
the
same
place
he
was
very
well
he
said
how
could
he
be
otherwise
he
was
just
where
he
ought
to
be
a
man
could
not
be
better
than
in
his
right
whereon
sir
robert
gave
him
up
for
mad
then
he
bethought
of
sending
him
a
harp
knowing
the
fame
of
hereward
s
music
and
singing
and
when
he
saw
the
harp
the
jailer
said
he
wept
but
bade
take
the
thing
away
and
so
sat
still
where
he
in
this
state
of
dull
despair
he
remained
for
many
weeks
at
last
he
woke
up
there
passed
through
and
by
bedford
large
bodies
of
troops
going
as
it
were
to
and
from
battle
the
clank
of
arms
stirred
hereward
s
heart
as
of
old
and
he
sent
to
sir
robert
to
ask
what
was
toward
sir
robert
the
venerable
man
came
to
him
joyfully
and
at
once
glad
to
speak
to
an
illustrious
captive
whom
he
looked
on
as
an
injured
man
and
told
him
news
enough
taillebois
s
warning
about
ralph
guader
and
waltheof
had
not
been
needless
ralph
as
the
most
influential
of
the
bretons
was
on
no
good
terms
with
the
normans
save
with
one
and
that
one
of
the
most
powerful
earl
of
hereford
his
sister
ralph
was
to
have
married
but
william
for
reasons
unknown
forbade
the
match
the
two
great
earls
celebrated
the
wedding
in
spite
of
william
and
asked
waltheof
as
a
guest
and
at
exning
between
the
fen
and
newmarket
heath
was
that
which
was
man
s
for
there
was
matured
the
plot
which
ivo
and
others
had
long
seen
brewing
william
had
made
himself
hateful
to
all
men
by
his
cruelties
and
tyrannies
and
indeed
his
government
was
growing
more
unrighteous
day
by
day
let
them
drive
him
out
of
england
and
part
the
land
between
them
two
should
be
dukes
the
third
king
paramount
waltheof
i
presume
plotted
drunk
and
repented
sober
when
too
late
the
wittol
he
should
have
been
a
repented
he
has
if
ever
he
was
guilty
for
he
fled
to
archbishop
lanfranc
and
confessed
to
him
so
much
that
lanfranc
declares
him
innocent
and
has
sent
him
on
to
william
in
o
kind
priest
true
priest
to
send
his
sheep
into
the
wolf
s
you
forget
dear
sire
that
william
is
our
i
can
hardly
forget
that
with
this
pretty
ring
upon
my
ankle
but
after
my
experience
of
how
he
has
kept
faith
with
me
what
can
i
expect
for
waltheof
the
wittol
save
that
which
i
have
foretold
many
a
time
as
for
you
dear
sire
the
king
has
been
misinformed
concerning
you
i
have
sent
messengers
to
reason
with
him
again
and
again
but
as
long
as
taillebois
warrenne
and
robert
malet
had
his
ear
of
what
use
were
my
poor
words
and
what
said
they
that
there
would
be
no
peace
in
england
if
you
were
they
lied
i
am
no
boy
like
waltheof
i
know
when
the
game
is
played
out
and
it
is
played
out
now
the
frenchman
is
master
and
i
know
it
well
were
i
loose
and
as
great
a
fool
as
waltheof
what
could
i
do
with
it
may
be
some
forty
knights
and
a
hundred
against
all
william
s
armies
but
how
goes
on
this
fool
s
rebellion
if
i
had
been
loose
i
might
have
helped
to
crush
it
in
the
and
you
would
have
done
that
against
waltheof
why
not
against
him
he
is
but
bringing
more
misery
on
england
tell
that
to
william
tell
him
that
if
he
sets
me
free
i
will
be
the
first
to
attack
waltheof
or
whom
he
will
there
are
no
english
left
to
fight
against
said
he
bitterly
for
waltheof
is
none
he
shall
know
your
words
when
he
returns
to
what
is
he
abroad
and
all
this
evil
going
on
in
normandy
but
the
english
have
risen
for
the
king
in
herefordshire
and
beaten
earl
roger
and
odo
of
bayeux
and
bishop
mowbray
are
on
their
way
to
cambridge
where
they
hope
to
give
a
good
account
of
earl
ralph
and
that
the
english
may
help
them
and
they
shall
they
hate
ralph
guader
as
much
as
i
do
can
you
send
a
message
for
me
whither
to
bourne
in
the
bruneswald
and
say
to
hereward
s
men
wherever
they
are
let
them
rise
and
arm
if
they
love
hereward
and
down
to
cambridge
to
be
the
foremost
at
bishop
odo
s
side
against
ralph
guader
or
waltheof
himself
send
send
o
that
i
were
free
would
to
heaven
thou
wert
free
my
gallant
sir
said
the
good
man
from
that
day
hereward
woke
up
somewhat
he
was
still
a
broken
man
querulous
peevish
but
the
hope
of
freedom
and
the
hope
of
battle
woke
him
up
if
he
could
but
get
to
his
men
but
his
melancholy
returned
his
men
some
of
them
at
least
went
down
to
odo
at
cambridge
and
did
good
service
guader
was
utterly
routed
and
escaped
to
norwich
and
thence
to
brittany
his
home
the
bishops
punished
their
prisoners
the
rebel
normans
with
horrible
mutilations
the
wolves
are
beginning
to
eat
each
other
said
hereward
to
himself
but
it
was
a
sickening
thought
to
him
that
his
men
had
been
fighting
and
he
not
at
their
head
after
a
while
there
came
to
bedford
castle
two
witty
knaves
one
was
a
cook
who
came
to
buy
milk
says
the
chronicler
the
other
seemingly
a
gleeman
they
told
stories
jested
harped
sang
drank
and
pleased
much
the
garrison
and
sir
robert
who
let
them
hang
about
the
place
they
asked
next
whether
it
were
true
that
the
famous
hereward
was
there
if
so
might
a
man
have
a
look
at
him
the
jailer
said
that
many
men
might
have
gone
to
see
him
so
easy
was
sir
robert
to
him
but
he
would
have
no
man
and
none
dare
enter
save
sir
robert
and
he
for
fear
of
their
lives
but
he
would
ask
him
of
herepol
the
good
knight
of
herepol
said
let
the
rogues
go
in
they
may
amuse
the
poor
so
they
went
in
and
as
soon
as
they
went
he
knew
them
one
was
martin
lightfoot
the
other
leofric
the
unlucky
who
sent
you
asked
he
surlily
turning
his
face
away
who
we
know
but
one
she
and
she
is
at
she
sent
you
and
wherefore
that
we
might
sing
to
you
and
make
you
hereward
answered
them
with
a
terrible
word
and
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
groaning
and
then
bade
them
sternly
to
go
so
they
went
for
the
time
the
jailer
told
this
to
sir
robert
who
saw
all
being
a
man
from
his
poor
first
wife
eh
well
there
can
be
no
harm
in
that
nor
if
they
came
from
this
lady
alftruda
either
for
that
matter
let
them
go
in
and
out
when
they
but
they
may
be
spies
and
then
we
can
but
hang
robert
of
herepol
it
would
appear
from
the
chronicle
did
not
much
care
whether
they
were
spies
or
not
so
the
men
went
to
and
fro
and
often
sat
with
hereward
but
he
forbade
them
sternly
to
mention
torfrida
s
name
alftruda
sent
to
him
meanwhile
again
and
again
messages
of
passionate
love
and
sorrow
and
he
listened
to
them
as
sullenly
as
he
did
to
his
two
servants
and
sent
no
answer
back
and
so
sat
more
weary
months
in
the
very
prison
it
may
be
in
the
very
room
in
which
john
bunyan
sat
nigh
six
hundred
years
after
but
in
a
very
different
frame
of
mind
one
day
sir
robert
was
going
up
the
stairs
with
another
knight
and
met
the
two
coming
down
he
was
talking
to
that
knight
earnestly
indignantly
and
somehow
as
he
passed
leofric
and
martin
he
thought
fit
to
raise
his
voice
as
if
in
a
great
wrath
shame
to
all
honor
and
chivalry
good
saints
in
heaven
what
a
thing
is
human
fortune
that
this
man
who
had
once
a
gallant
army
at
his
back
should
be
at
this
moment
going
like
a
sheep
to
the
slaughter
to
buckingham
castle
at
the
mercy
of
his
worst
enemy
ivo
taillebois
of
all
men
in
the
world
if
there
were
a
dozen
knights
left
of
all
those
whom
he
used
to
heap
with
wealth
and
honor
worthy
the
name
of
knights
they
would
catch
us
between
here
and
stratford
and
make
a
free
man
of
their
so
spake
or
words
to
that
effect
according
to
the
latin
chronicler
who
must
have
got
them
from
leofric
himself
the
good
knight
of
herepol
hillo
knaves
said
he
seeing
the
two
are
you
here
eavesdropping
out
of
the
castle
this
instant
on
your
which
hint
those
two
witty
knaves
took
on
the
spot
a
few
days
after
hereward
was
travelling
toward
buckingham
chained
upon
a
horse
with
sir
robert
and
his
men
and
a
goodly
company
of
knights
belonging
to
ivo
ivo
as
the
story
runs
seems
to
have
arranged
with
ralph
pagnel
at
buckingham
to
put
him
into
the
keeping
of
a
creature
of
his
own
and
how
easy
it
was
to
put
out
a
man
s
eyes
or
starve
him
to
death
in
a
norman
keep
none
knew
better
than
hereward
but
he
was
past
fear
or
sorrow
a
dull
heavy
cloud
of
despair
had
settled
down
upon
his
soul
black
with
sin
his
heart
could
not
pray
he
had
hardened
himself
against
all
heaven
and
earth
and
thought
when
he
thought
at
all
only
of
his
wrongs
but
never
of
his
sins
they
passed
through
a
forest
seemingly
somewhere
near
what
is
newport
pagnel
named
after
ralph
his
jailer
suddenly
from
the
trees
dashed
out
a
body
of
knights
and
at
their
head
the
banner
in
ranald
of
ramsey
s
hand
halt
shouted
sir
robert
we
are
past
the
stone
earl
ivo
s
and
earl
ralph
s
men
are
answerable
now
for
the
treason
shouted
ivo
s
men
and
one
would
have
struck
hereward
through
with
his
lance
but
winter
was
too
quick
for
him
and
bore
him
from
his
saddle
and
then
dragged
hereward
out
of
the
fight
the
normans
surprised
while
their
helmets
were
hanging
at
their
saddles
and
their
arms
not
ready
for
battle
were
scattered
at
once
but
they
returned
to
the
attack
confident
in
their
own
numbers
they
were
over
confident
hereward
s
fetters
were
knocked
off
and
he
was
horsed
and
armed
and
mad
with
freedom
and
battle
fighting
like
himself
once
more
only
as
he
rode
to
and
fro
thrusting
and
hewing
he
shouted
to
his
men
to
spare
sir
robert
and
all
his
meinie
crying
that
he
was
the
savior
of
his
life
and
when
the
fight
was
over
and
all
ivo
s
and
ralph
s
men
who
were
not
slain
had
ridden
for
their
lives
into
stratford
he
shook
hands
with
that
venerable
knight
giving
him
innumerable
thanks
and
courtesies
for
his
honorable
keeping
and
begged
him
to
speak
well
of
him
to
the
king
and
so
these
two
parted
in
peace
and
hereward
was
a
free
man
chapter

how
earl
waltheof
was
made
a
saint
a
few
months
after
there
sat
in
abbot
thorold
s
lodgings
in
peterborough
a
select
company
of
normans
talking
over
affairs
of
state
after
their
supper

abbot
as
he
sipped
his
wine
the

of
our
good
king
which
is
happily
the
cause
of
holy
church
goes
well
i
think
we
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
when
we
review
the
events
of
the
past
year

have

to
which

descend
we
have
not
a

left
which
is
not

we
have
not
an

i
said
ivo
taillebois
till
i
see
hereward
s
head
on
bourne
gable
where
he
stuck
up
those
norman
s
heads
seven
years
ago
but
what
the
lord
abbot
means
by
saying
that
we
have
done
with
english
saints
i
do
not
see
for
the
villains
of
crowland
have
just
made
a
new
one
for
a
new
one
i
tell
you
truth
and
fact
i
will
tell
you
all
lord
abbot
and
you
shall
judge
whether
it
is
not
enough
to
drive
an
honest
man
mad
to
see
such
things
going
on
under
his
nose
men
say
of
me
that
i
am
rough
and
swear
and
blaspheme
i
put
it
to
you
lord
abbot
if
job
would
not
have
cursed
if
he
had
been
lord
of
spalding
you
know
that
the
king
let
these
crowland
monks
have
waltheof
s
body
yes
i
thought
it
an
unwise
act
of
grace
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
leave
him
as
he
desired
out
on
the
down
in
ground
of
course
of
course
for
what
has
happened
that
old
traitor
ulfketyl
and
his
monks
bring
the
body
to
crowland
and
bury
it
as
if
it
had
been
the
pope
s
in
a
week
they
begin
to
spread
their
lies
that
waltheof
was
innocent
that
archbishop
lanfranc
himself
said
that
was
the
only
act
of
human
weakness
which
i
have
ever
known
the
venerable
prelate
commit
said
thorold
that
these
normans
at
winchester
were
so
in
the
traitor
s
favor
that
the
king
had
to
have
him
out
and
cut
off
his
head
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
ere
folks
were
up
and
about
that
the
fellow
was
so
holy
that
he
passed
all
his
time
in
prison
in
weeping
and
praying
and
said
over
the
whole
psalter
every
day
because
his
mother
had
taught
it
him
i
wish
she
had
taught
him
to
be
an
honest
man
and
that
when
his
head
was
on
the
block
he
said
all
the
paternoster
as
far
as
lead
us
not
into
temptation
and
then
off
went
his
head
whereon
his
head
being
off
finished
the
prayer
with
you
know
best
what
comes
next
abbot
deliver
us
from
evil
amen
what
a
manifest
lie
the
traitor
was
not
permitted
it
is
plain
to
ask
for
that
which
could
never
be
granted
to
him
but
his
soul
unworthy
to
be
delivered
from
evil
entered
instead
into
evil
and
howls
forever
in
the
but
all
the
rest
may
be
true
said
oger
and
yet
that
be
no
reason
why
these
monks
should
say
so
i
told
them
and
threatened
them
too
for
not
content
with
making
him
a
martyr
they
are
making
him
a
impious
who
can
do
that
save
the
holy
father
said
thorold
you
had
best
get
your
bishop
to
look
to
them
then
for
they
are
carrying
blind
beggars
and
mad
girls
by
the
dozen
to
be
cured
at
the
man
s
tomb
that
is
all
their
fellows
in
the
cell
at
spalding
went
about
to
take
a
girl
that
had
fits
off
one
of
my
manors
to
cure
her
but
that
i
stopped
with
a
good
and
and
gave
the
monks
a
piece
of
my
mind
and
drove
them
clean
out
of
their
cell
home
to
what
a
piece
of
ivo
s
mind
on
this
occasion
might
be
let
ingulf
describe
against
our
monastery
and
all
the
people
of
crowland
he
was
by
the
instigation
of
the
devil
raised
to
such
an
extreme
pitch
of
fury
that
he
would
follow
their
animals
in
the
marshes
with
his
dogs
drive
them
to
a
great
distance
down
in
the
lakes
mutilate
some
in
the
tails
others
in
the
ears
while
often
by
breaking
the
backs
and
legs
of
the
beasts
of
burden
he
rendered
them
utterly
useless
against
our
cell
also
at
spalding
and
our
brethren
his
neighbors
the
prior
and
monks
who
dwelt
all
day
within
his
presence
he
rages
with
tyrannical
and
frantic
fury
lamed
their
oxen
and
horses
daily
impounded
their
sheep
and
poultry
striking
down
killing
and
slaying
their
swine
and
pigs
while
at
the
same
time
the
servants
of
the
prior
were
oppressed
in
the
earl
s
court
with
insupportable
exactions
were
often
assaulted
in
the
highways
with
swords
and
staves
and
sometimes
well
went
on
the
injured
earl
this
hereward
gets
news
of
me
and
news
too
i
don
t
know
whence
but
true
enough
it
is
that
i
had
sworn
to
drive
ulfketyl
out
of
crowland
by
writ
from
king
and
bishop
and
lock
him
up
as
a
minister
at
the
other
end
of
you
will
do
but
right
i
will
send
a
knight
off
to
the
king
this
day
telling
him
all
and
begging
him
to
send
us
up
a
trusty
norman
as
abbot
of
crowland
that
we
may
have
one
more
gentleman
in
the
land
fit
for
our
you
must
kill
hereward
first
for
as
i
was
going
to
say
he
sent
word
to
me
that
the
monks
of
crowland
were
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
and
abbot
ulfketyl
to
him
as
more
than
a
father
and
that
if
i
dared
to
lay
a
finger
on
them
or
their
property
he
would
cut
my
head
he
has
promised
to
cut
my
head
off
likewise
said
ascelin
earl
knights
and
gentlemen
do
you
not
think
it
wiser
that
we
should
lay
our
wits
together
once
and
for
all
and
cut
off
but
who
will
catch
the
wake
sleeping
said
ivo
laughing
that
will
i
have
my
plans
and
my
and
so
those
wicked
men
took
counsel
together
to
slay
hereward
chapter
xlii
how
hereward
got
the
best
of
his
soul
s
price
in
those
days
a
messenger
came
riding
post
to
bourne
the
countess
judith
wished
to
visit
the
tomb
of
her
late
husband
earl
waltheof
and
asked
hospitality
on
her
road
of
hereward
and
alftruda
of
course
she
would
come
with
a
great
train
and
the
trouble
and
expense
would
be
great
but
the
hospitality
of
those
days
when
money
was
scarce
and
wine
scarcer
still
was
unbounded
and
a
matter
of
course
and
alftruda
was
overjoyed
no
doubt
judith
was
the
most
unpopular
person
in
england
at
that
moment
called
by
all
a
traitress
and
a
fiend
but
she
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
alftruda
s
she
was
the
king
s
niece
she
was
immensely
rich
not
only
in
manors
of
her
own
but
in
manors
as
testifies
about
lincolnshire
and
the
counties
round
which
had
belonged
to
her
murdered
husband
which
she
had
too
probably
received
as
the
price
of
her
treason
so
alftruda
looked
to
her
visit
as
to
an
honor
which
would
enable
her
to
hold
her
head
high
among
the
proud
norman
dames
who
despised
her
as
the
wife
of
an
englishman
hereward
looked
on
the
visit
in
a
different
light
he
called
judith
ugly
names
not
undeserved
and
vowed
that
if
she
entered
his
house
by
the
front
door
he
would
go
out
at
the
back
torfrida
prophesied
he
said
that
she
would
betray
her
husband
and
she
had
done
torfrida
prophesied
did
she
prophesy
that
i
should
betray
you
likewise
asked
alftruda
in
a
tone
of
bitter
scorn
no
you
handsome
fiend
will
you
do
it
yes
i
am
a
handsome
fiend
am
i
not
and
she
bridled
up
her
magnificent
beauty
and
stood
over
him
as
a
snake
stands
over
a
mouse
yes
you
are
handsome
beautiful
i
adore
and
yet
you
will
not
do
what
i
wish
what
you
wish
what
would
i
not
do
for
you
what
have
i
not
done
for
you
then
receive
judith
and
now
go
hunting
and
bring
me
in
game
i
want
deer
roe
fowls
anything
and
everything
from
the
greatest
to
the
smallest
go
and
and
hereward
trembled
and
went
there
are
flowers
whose
scent
is
so
luscious
that
silly
children
will
plunge
their
heads
among
them
drinking
in
their
odor
to
the
exclusion
of
all
fresh
air
on
a
sudden
sometimes
comes
a
revulsion
of
the
nerves
the
sweet
odor
changes
in
a
moment
to
a
horrible
one
and
the
child
can
not
bear
for
years
after
the
scent
which
has
once
disgusted
it
by
and
so
had
it
happened
to
hereward
he
did
not
love
alftruda
now
he
loathed
hated
dreaded
her
and
yet
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
for
a
moment
off
her
beauty
he
watched
every
movement
of
her
hand
to
press
it
obey
it
he
would
have
preferred
instead
of
hunting
simply
to
sit
and
watch
her
go
about
the
house
at
her
work
he
was
to
a
thing
which
he
regarded
with
horror
but
he
was
told
to
go
and
hunt
and
he
went
with
all
his
men
and
sent
home
large
supplies
for
the
larder
and
as
he
hunted
the
free
fresh
air
of
the
forest
comforted
him
the
free
forest
life
came
back
to
him
and
he
longed
to
be
an
outlaw
once
more
and
hunt
on
forever
he
would
not
go
back
yet
at
least
to
face
that
judith
so
he
sent
back
the
greater
part
of
his
men
with
a
story
he
was
ill
he
was
laid
up
at
a
far
away
in
the
forest
and
begged
the
countess
to
excuse
his
absence
he
had
sent
fresh
supplies
of
game
and
a
goodly
company
of
his
men
knights
and
housecarles
who
would
escort
her
royally
to
crowland
judith
cared
little
for
his
absence
he
was
but
an
english
barbarian
alftruda
was
half
glad
to
have
him
out
of
the
way
lest
his
now
sullen
and
uncertain
temper
should
break
out
and
bowed
herself
to
the
earth
before
judith
who
patronized
her
to
her
heart
s
content
and
offered
her
slyly
insolent
condolences
on
being
married
to
a
barbarian
she
herself
could
sympathize
who
more
alftruda
might
have
answered
with
scorn
that
she
was
an
adeliza
and
of
better
english
blood
than
judith
s
norman
blood
but
she
had
her
ends
to
gain
and
gained
them
for
judith
was
pleased
to
be
so
delighted
with
her
that
she
kissed
her
lovingly
and
said
with
much
emotion
that
she
required
a
friend
who
would
support
her
through
her
coming
trial
and
who
better
than
one
who
herself
had
suffered
so
much
would
she
accompany
her
to
crowland
alftruda
was
overjoyed
and
away
they
went
and
to
crowland
they
came
and
to
the
tomb
in
the
minster
whereof
men
said
already
that
the
sacred
corpse
within
worked
miracles
of
healing
and
judith
habited
in
widow
s
weeds
approached
the
tomb
and
laid
on
it
as
a
to
the
manes
of
the
dead
a
splendid
pall
of
silk
and
gold
a
fierce
blast
came
howling
off
the
fen
screeched
through
the
minster
towers
swept
along
the
dark
aisles
and
then
so
say
the
chroniclers
caught
up
the
pall
from
off
the
tomb
and
hurled
it
far
away
into
a
corner
a
miracle
cried
all
the
monks
at
once
and
honestly
enough
like
true
englishmen
as
they
were
the
holy
heart
refuses
the
gift
countess
said
old
ulfketyl
in
a
voice
of
awe
judith
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
turned
away
trembling
and
walked
out
while
all
looked
upon
her
as
a
thing
accursed
of
her
subsequent
life
her
folly
her
wantonness
her
disgrace
her
poverty
her
wanderings
her
wretched
death
let
others
tell
but
these
normans
believed
that
the
curse
of
heaven
was
upon
her
from
that
day
and
the
best
of
them
believed
likewise
that
waltheof
s
murder
was
the
reason
that
william
her
uncle
prospered
no
more
in
life
ah
saucy
sir
said
alftruda
to
ulfketyl
as
she
went
out
there
is
one
waiting
at
peterborough
now
who
will
teach
thee
manners
ingulf
of
fontenelle
abbot
in
thy
does
hereward
know
that
asked
ulfketyl
looking
keenly
at
her
what
is
that
to
thee
said
she
fiercely
and
flung
out
of
the
minster
but
hereward
did
not
know
there
were
many
things
abroad
of
which
she
told
him
nothing
they
went
back
and
were
landed
at
deeping
town
and
making
their
way
along
the
king
street
or
old
roman
road
to
bourne
thereon
a
man
met
them
running
they
had
best
stay
where
they
were
the
frenchmen
were
out
and
there
was
fighting
up
in
bourne
alftruda
s
knights
wanted
to
push
on
to
see
after
the
bourne
folk
judith
s
knights
wanted
to
push
on
to
help
the
french
and
the
two
parties
were
ready
to
fight
each
other
there
was
a
great
tumult
the
ladies
had
much
ado
to
still
it
alftruda
said
that
it
might
be
but
a
countryman
s
rumor
that
at
least
it
was
shame
to
quarrel
with
their
guests
at
last
it
was
agreed
that
two
knights
should
gallop
on
into
bourne
and
bring
back
news
but
those
knights
never
came
back
so
the
whole
body
moved
on
bourne
and
there
they
found
out
the
news
for
themselves
hereward
had
gone
home
as
soon
as
they
had
departed
and
sat
down
to
eat
and
drink
his
manner
was
sad
and
strange
he
drank
much
at
the
midday
meal
and
then
lay
down
to
sleep
setting
guards
as
usual
after
a
while
he
leapt
up
with
a
shriek
and
a
shudder
they
ran
to
him
asking
whether
he
was
ill
no
yes
ill
at
heart
i
have
had
a
dream
an
ugly
dream
i
thought
that
all
the
men
i
ever
slew
on
earth
came
to
me
with
their
wounds
all
gaping
and
cried
at
me
our
luck
then
thy
luck
chaplain
is
there
not
a
verse
somewhere
uncle
brand
said
it
to
me
on
his
deathbed
whoso
sheddeth
man
s
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
surely
the
master
is
fey
whispered
gwenoch
in
fear
to
the
chaplain
answer
him
out
of
text
none
such
that
i
know
of
quoth
priest
ailward
a
graceless
fellow
who
had
taken
leofric
s
place
if
that
were
the
law
it
would
be
but
few
honest
men
that
would
die
in
their
beds
let
us
drink
and
drive
girls
fancies
out
of
our
so
they
drank
again
and
hereward
fell
asleep
once
more
it
is
thy
turn
to
watch
priest
said
gwenoch
to
ailward
so
keep
the
door
well
for
i
am
worn
out
with
hunting
and
so
fell
asleep
ailward
shuffled
into
his
harness
and
went
to
the
door
the
wine
was
heady
the
sun
was
hot
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
asleep
likewise
hereward
slept
who
can
tell
how
long
but
at
last
there
was
a
bustle
a
heavy
fall
and
waking
with
a
start
he
sprang
up
he
saw
ailward
lying
dead
across
the
gate
and
above
him
a
crowd
of
fierce
faces
some
of
which
he
knew
too
well
he
saw
ivo
taillebois
he
saw
oger
he
saw
his
sir
raoul
de
dol
he
saw
sir
ascelin
he
saw
sir
aswa
thorold
s
man
he
saw
sir
hugh
of
evermue
his
own
and
with
them
he
saw
or
seemed
to
see
the
ogre
of
cornwall
and
o
brodar
of
ivark
and
dirk
hammerhand
of
walcheren
and
many
another
old
foe
long
underground
and
in
his
ear
rang
the
text
whoso
sheddeth
man
s
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
and
hereward
knew
that
his
end
was
come
there
was
no
time
to
put
on
mail
or
helmet
he
saw
the
old
sword
and
shield
hang
on
a
perch
and
tore
them
down
as
he
girded
the
sword
on
winter
sprang
to
his
side
i
have
three
lances
two
for
me
and
one
for
you
and
we
can
hold
the
door
against
till
they
fire
the
house
over
our
heads
shall
hereward
die
like
a
wolf
in
a
cave
forward
all
hereward
s
men
and
he
rushed
out
upon
his
fate
no
man
followed
him
save
winter
the
rest
disperst
unarmed
were
running
hither
and
thither
helplessly
brothers
in
arms
and
brothers
in
valhalla
shouted
winter
as
he
rushed
after
him
a
knight
was
running
to
and
fro
in

court
shouting
hereward

name
where
is
the
villain
wake
we
have
caught
thee
asleep
at

am
out
quoth
hereward
as
the
man
almost
stumbled
against
him
and
this
is
and
through
shield
hauberk
and
body
as
says
gaima
went
hereward
s
javelin
while
all
drew
back
confounded
for
the
moment
at
that
mighty
stroke
felons
shouted
hereward
your
king
has
given
me
his
truce
and
do
you
dare
break
my
house
and
kill
my
folk
is
that
your
norman
law
and
is
this
your
norman
honor
to
take
a
man
unawares
over
his
meat
come
on
traitors
all
and
get
what
you
can
of
a
naked
man

without

you
will
buy
it
dear
guard
my
back
winter
and
he
ran
right
at
the
press
of
knights
and
the
fight
began
he
gored
them
like
a
boar
as
long
as
that
lance
might
endure
says
gaimar
and
when
that
lance
did
break
in
hand
full
fell
enough
he
smote
with
and
as
he
hewed
on
silently
with
grinding
teeth
and
hard
glittering
eyes
of
whom
did
he
think
of
alftruda
not
so
but
of
that
pale
ghost
with
great
black
hollow
eyes
who
sat
in
crowland
with
thin
bare
feet
and
sackcloth
on
her
tender
limbs
watching
praying
longing
loving
uncomplaining
that
ghost
had
been
for
many
a
month
the
background
of
all
his
thoughts
and
dreams
it
was
so
clear
before
his
mind
s
eye
now
that
unawares
to
himself
he
shouted
torfrida
as
he
struck
and
struck
the
harder
at
the
sound
of
his
old
and
now
he
is
all
wounded
and
and
winter
who
has
fought
back
to
back
with
him
has
fallen
on
his
face
and
hereward
stands
alone
turning
from
side
to
side
as
he
sweeps
his
sword
right
and
left
till
the
forest
rings
with
the
blows
but
staggering
as
he
turns
within
a
ring
of
eleven
corpses
he
stands
who
will
go
in
and
make
the
twelfth
a
knight
rushes
in
to
fall
headlong
down
cloven
through
the
helm
but
hereward
s
blade
snaps
short
and
he
hurls
it
away
as
his
foes
rush
in
with
a
shout
of
joy
he
tears
his
shield
from
his
left
arm
and
with
it
says
gaimar
brains
two
more
but
the
end
is
come
taillebois
and
evermue
are
behind
him
now
four
lances
are
through
his
back
and
bear
him
down
to
his
knees
cut
off
his
head
breton
shouted
ivo
raoul
de
dol
rushed
forward
sword
in
hand
at
that
cry
hereward
lifted
up
his
dying
head
one
stroke
more
ere
it
was
all
done
forever
and
with
a
shout
of
torfrida
which
made
the
bruneswald
ring
he
hurled
the
shield
full
in
the
breton
s
face
and
fell
forward
dead
the
knights
drew
their
lances
from
that
terrible
corpse
slowly
and
with
caution
as
men
who
have
felled
a
bear
yet
dare
not
step
within
reach
of
the
seemingly
lifeless
paw
the

said
ivo
lucky
for
us
that
sir
ascelin
had
news
of
his
knights
being
gone
to
crowland
if
he
had
had
them
to
back
him
we
had
not
done
this
deed
i
will
make
sure
said
ascelin
as
he
struck
off
the
once
fair
and
golden
head
ho
breton
cried
ivo
the
villain
is
dead
get
up
man
and
see
for
yourself
what
ails
him
but
when
they
lifted
up
raoul
de
dol
his
brains
were
running
down
his
face
and
all
men
stood
astonished
at
that
last
mighty
stroke
that
blow
said
ascelin
will
be
sung
hereafter
by
minstrel
and
maiden
as
the
last
blow
of
the
last
englishman
knights
we
have
slain
a
better
knight
than
ourselves
if
there
had
been
three
more
such
men
in
this
realm
they
would
have
driven
us
and
king
william
back
again
into
the
so
said
ascelin
those
words
of
his
too
were
sung
by
many
a
jongleur
norman
as
well
as
english
in
the
times
that
were
to
come
likely
enough
said
ivo
but
that
is
the
more
reason
why
we
should
set
that
head
of
his
up
over
the
as
a
warning
to
these
english
churls
that
their
last
man
is
dead
and
their
last
stake
thrown
and
so
perished
the
last
of
the
it
was
the
third
day
the
normans
were
drinking
in
the
hall
of
bourne
casting
lots
among
themselves
who
should
espouse
the
fair
alftruda
who
sat
weeping
within
over
the
headless
corpse
when
in
the
afternoon
a
servant
came
in
and
told
them
how
a
barge
full
of
monks
had
come
to
the
shore
and
that
they
seemed
to
be
monks
from
crowland
ivo
taillebois
bade
drive
them
back
again
into
the
barge
with
whips
but
hugh
of
evermue
spoke
up

and
cursed
but
the
monks
came
up
and
into
the
hall
and
at
their
head
ingulf
himself
to
receive
whom
all
men
rose
save
taillebois
i
come

in

courtly
french

in

a
haughty
voice

a
nun
stepped
forward
who
had
stood
just
behind
ingulf
she
was
clothed
entirely
in
black
her
bare
feet
were
bleeding
from
the
stones
her
hand
as
she
lifted
it
was
as
thin
as
a
skeleton
s
she
threw
back
her
veil
and
showed
to
the
knights
what
had
been
once
the
famous
beauty
of
torfrida
but
the
beauty
was
long
past
away
her
hair
was
white
as
snow
her
cheeks
were
fallen
in
her
features
were
all
sharp
and
hard
only
in
their
hollow
sockets
burned
still
the
great
black
eyes
so
fiercely
that
all
men
turned
uneasily
from
her
gaze
churl
barbarian
she
said
slowly
and
quietly
but
with
an
intensity
which
was
more
terrible
than
rage
who
gives
such
names
to
one
who
was
as
much
better
born
and
better
bred

fixed
steadily
on

eyes

widened
every

he
turned
shrinking
from

said
torfrida

flung
open
the

at
their

discovering

sitting
by

by

then
with

drew

the

sprang
in

out
glad
to
escape
in
a
minute
he
returned
the
head
was
already
taken
down
a
tall
lay
brother
the
moment
he
had
seen
it
had
climbed
the
gable
snatched
it
away
and
now
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
yard
holding
it
on
his
knees
talking
to
it
chiding
it
as
if
it
had
been
alive
when
men
had
offered
to
take
it
he
had
drawn
a
from
under
his
frock
and
threatened
to
brain
all
comers
and
the
monks
had
warned
off
ascelin
saying
that
the
man
was
mad
and
had
berserk
fits
of
superhuman
strength
and
rage
he
will
give
it

said
torfrida

went
out
look
at
that

head
said
the
madman
ten
years
agone
you
and
i
took
down
from
thence
another
head

get
yourself
at

up
into
that

why
would

torfrida
took
it

went
in

the
monks
silently
took
up
the
bier
and
all
went
forth
and
down
the
hill
toward
the
fen
they
laid
the
corpse
within
the

then
died
far
off
within
the
boundless
mist
and
left
the
norman
master
of
the
land
so
torfrida
took
the
corpse
home
to
crowland
and
buried
it
in
the
choir
near
the
blessed
martyr
waltheof
after
which
she
did
not
die

with
pains
unspeakable
for
never
were
any
martyrs
tormented
as
these
were
they
hung
some
by
their
feet
and
smoked
them
with
foul
smoke
some
by
the
thumbs
or
by
the
head
and
put
burning
things
on
their
feet
they
put
a
knotted
string
round
their
heads
and
twisted
it
till
it
went
into
the
brain
they
put
them
in
dungeons
wherein
were
adders
and
snakes
and
toads
and
thus
wore
them
out
some
they
put
into
a
that
is
into
a
chest
that
was
short
and
narrow
and
they
put
sharp
stones
therein
and
crushed
the
man
so
that
they
broke
all
his
bones
there
were
hateful
and
grim
things
called
sachenteges
in
many
of
the
castles
which
two
or
three
men
had
enough
to
do
to
carry
this
sachentege
was
made
thus
it
was
fastened
to
a
beam
having
a
sharp
iron
to
go
round
a
man
s
throat
and
neck
so
that
he
might
no
ways
sit
nor
lie
nor
sleep
but
he
must
bear
all
the
iron
many
thousands
they
wore
out
with
hunger
they
were
continually
levying
a
tax
from
the
towns
which
they
called
truserie
and
when
the
wretched
townsfolk
had
no
more
to
give
then
burnt
they
all
the
towns
so
that
well
mightest
thou
walk
a
whole
day
s
journey
or
ever
thou
shouldest
see
a
man
settled
in
a
town
or
its
lands
tilled
then
was
corn
dear
and
flesh
and
cheese
and
butter
for
there
was
none
in
the
land
wretched
men
starved
with
hunger
some
lived
on
alms
who
had
been
once
rich
some
fled
the
country
never
was
there
more
misery
and
never
heathens
acted
worse
than
for
now
the
sons
of
the
church
s
darlings
of
the
crusaders
whom
the
pope
had
sent
beneath
a
gonfalon
blessed
by
him
to
destroy
the
liberties
of
england
turned
by
a
just
retribution
upon
that
very
norman
clergy
who
had
abetted
all
their
iniquities
in
the
name
of
rome
they
spared
neither
church
nor
churchyard
but
took
all
that
was
valuable
therein
and
then
burned
the
church
and
all
together
neither
did
they
spare
the
lands
of
bishops
nor
of
abbots
nor
of
priests
but
they
robbed
the
monks
and
clergy
and
every
man
plundered
his
neighbor
as
much
as
he
could
if
two
or
three
men
came
riding
to
a
town
all
the
townsfolk
fled
before
them
and
thought
that
they
were
robbers
the
bishops
and
clergy
were
forever
cursing
them
but
this
to
them
was
nothing
for
they
were
all
accursed
and
forsworn
and
reprobate
the
earth
bare
no
corn
you
might
as
well
have
tilled
the
sea
for
all
the
land
was
ruined
by
such
deeds
and
it
was
said
openly
that
christ
and
his
saints
and
so
was
avenged
the
blood
of
harold
and
his
brothers
of
edwin
and
morcar
of
waltheof
and
hereward
and
those
who
had
the
spirit
of
hereward
in
them
fled
to
the
merry
greenwood
and
became
bold
outlaws
with
robin
hood
scarlet
and
john
adam
bell
and
clym
of
the
cleugh
and
william
of
cloudeslee
and
watched
with
sullen
joy
the
norman
robbers
tearing
in
pieces
each
other
and
the
church
who
had
blest
their
crime
and
they
talked
and
sung
of
hereward
and
all
his
doughty
deeds
over
the
hearth
in
lone
or
in
the
outlaw
s
lodge
beneath
the
hollins
green
and
all
the
burden
of
their
song
was
ah
that
hereward
were
alive
again
for
they
knew
not
that
hereward
was
alive
forevermore
that
only
his
husk
and
shell
lay
mouldering
there
in
crowland
choir
that
above
them
and
around
them
and
in
them
destined
to
raise
them
out
of
that
bitter
bondage
and
mould
them
into
a
great
nation
and
the
parents
of
still
greater
nations
in
lands
as
yet
unknown
brooded
the
immortal
spirit
of
hereward
now
purged
from
all
earthly
dross
even
the
spirit
of
freedom
which
can
never
die

how
deeping

was
drained
but
war
and
disorder
ruin
and
death
can
not
last
forever
they
are
by
their
own
nature
exceptional
and
suicidal
and
spend
themselves
with

they
feed
on
and
then
the
true

of

themselves
as
they
have
been
waiting
all
along
to
do
hid
in
god
s
presence
from
the
strife
of
men
and
even
so
it
was
with
bourne
nearly
eighty
years
after
in
the
year
of
grace
there
might
have
been
seen
sitting
side
by
side
and
hand
in
hand
upon
a
sunny
bench
on
the
bruneswald
slope
in
the
low
december
sun
an
old
knight
and
an
old
lady
the
master
and
mistress
of
bourne
much
had
changed
since
hereward
s
days
the
house
below
had
been
raised
a
whole
story
there
were
fresh
herbs
and
flowers
in
the
garden
unknown
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
but
the
great
change
was
in
the
fen
especially
away
toward
deeping
on
the
southern
horizon
where
had
been
lonely
meres
foul
watercourses
stagnant
slime
there
were
now
great
dikes
rich
and
fair
corn
and
grass
lands
rows
of
pure
white
cottages
the
land
swarmed
with
stocks
of
new
breeds
horses
and
sheep
from
flanders
cattle
from
normandy
for
richard
de
rulos
was
the
first
as
far
as
history
tells
of
that
noble
class
of
agricultural
squires
who
are
england
s
blessing
and
england
s
pride
for
this
richard
de
rulos
says
ingulf
or
whoever
wrote
in
his
name
who
had
married
the
daughter
and
heiress
of
hugh
of
evermue
lord
of
bourne
and
deeping
being
a
man
of
agricultural
pursuits
got
permission
from
the
monks
of
crowland
for
twenty
marks
of
silver
to
enclose
as
much
as
he
would
of
the
common
marshes
so
he
shut
out
the
welland
by
a
strong
embankment
and
building
thereon
numerous
tenements
and
cottages
in
a
short
time
he
formed
a
large
vill
marked
out
gardens
and
cultivated
fields
while
by
shutting
out
the
river
he
found
in
the
meadow
land
which
had
been
lately
deep
lakes
and
impassable
marshes
wherefore
the
place
was
called
deeping
the
deep
meadow
most
fertile
fields
and
desirable
lands
and
out
of
sloughs
and
bogs
accursed
made
quiet
a
garden
of
so
there
the
good
man
the
beginner
of
the
good
work
of
centuries
sat
looking
out
over
the
fen
and
listening
to
the
music
which
came
on
the
southern
breeze
above
the
low
of
the
kine
and
the
clang
of
the
settling
down
to
rest
from
the
bells
of
crowland
minster
far
away
they
were
not
the
same
bells
which
tolled
for
hereward
and
torfrida
those
had
run
down
in
molten
streams
upon
that
fatal
night
when
abbot
ingulf
leaped
out
of
bed
to
see
the
vast
wooden
sanctuary
wrapt
in
one
sheet
of
roaring
flame
from
the
carelessness
of
a
plumber
who
had
raked
the
ashes
over
his
fire
in
the
and
left
it
to
smoulder
through
the
night
then
perished
all
the
riches
of
crowland
its
library
too
of
more
than
seven
hundred
volumes
with
that
famous
nadir
or
orrery
the
like
whereof
was
not
in
all
england
wherein
the
seven
planets
were
represented
each
in
their
proper
metals
and
even
worse
all
the
charters
of
the
monastery
perished
a
loss
which
involved
the
monks
thereof
in
centuries
of
lawsuits
and
compelled
them
to
become
as
industrious
and
skilful
forgers
of
documents
as
were
to
be
found
in
the
minsters
of
the
middle
age
but
crowland
minster
had
been
rebuilt
in
greater
glory
than
ever
by
the
help
of
the
norman
gentry
round
abbot
ingulf
finding
that
guthlac
s
plain
inability
to
take
care
of
himself
had
discredited
him
much
in
the
s
eyes
fell
back
norman
as
he
was
on
the
virtues
of
the
holy
martyr
waltheof
whose
tomb
he
opened
with
due
reverence
and
found
the
body
as
whole
and
uncorrupted
as
on
the
day
on
which
it
was
buried
and
the
head
united
to
the
body
while
a
fine
crimson
line
around
the
neck
was
the
only
sign
remaining
of
his
decollation
on
seeing
which
ingulf
could
not
contain
himself
for
joy
and
interrupting
the
response
which
the
brethren
were
singing
with
a
loud
voice
began
the
hymn
te
deum
laudamus
on
which
the
chanter
taking
it
up
enjoined
the
rest
of
the
brethren
to
sing
after
which
ingulf
who
had
never
seen
waltheof
in
life
discovered
that
it
was
none
other
than
he
whom
he
had
seen
in
a
vision
at
fontenelle
as
an
earl
most
gorgeously
arrayed
with
a
torc
of
gold
about
his
neck
and
with
him
an
abbot
two
bishops
and
two
saints
the
two
former
being
usfran
and
ausbert
the
abbots
wandresigil
of
fontenelle
and
the
two
saints
of
course
guthlac
and
neot
whereon
crawling
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
kissed
the
face
of
the
holy
martyr
and
perceived
such
a
sweet
odor
proceeding
from
the
holy
body
as
he
never
remembered
to
have
smelt
either
in
the
palace
of
the
king
or
in
syria
with
all
its
aromatic
plura
what
more
was
needed
for
a
convent
of
monks
waltheof
was
translated
in
state
to
the
side
of
guthlac
and
the
news
of
this
translation
of
the
holy
martyr
being
spread
throughout
the
country
multitudes
of
the
faithful
flocked
daily
to
the
tomb
and
offering
up
their
vows
there
tended
in
a
great
degree
to
resuscitate
our
but
more
the
virtues
of
waltheof
were
too
great
not
to
turn
themselves
or
be
turned
to
some
practical
use
so
if
not
in
the
days
of
ingulf
at
least
in
those
of
abbot
joffrid
who
came
after
him
waltheof
began
says
peter
of
blois
to
work
wonderful
deeds
the
blind
received
their
sight
the
deaf
their
hearing
the
lame
their
power
of
walking
and
the
dumb
their
power
of
speech
while
each
day
troops
innumerable
of
other
sick
persons
were
arriving
by
every
road
as
to
the
very
fountain
of
their
safety
and
by
the
offerings
of
the
pilgrims
who
came
flocking
in
from
every
part
the
revenues
of
the
monastery
were
increased
in
no
small
only
one
wicked
norman
monk
of
alban
s
audwin
by
name
dared
to
dispute
the
sanctity
of
the
martyr
calling
him
a
wicked
traitor
who
had
met
with
his
deserts
in
vain
did
abbot
joffrid
himself
a
norman
from
evroult
expostulate
with
the
inconvenient
blasphemer
he
launched
out
into
invective
beyond
measure
till
on
the
spot
in
presence
of
the
said
father
he
was
seized
with
such
a
that
he
went
home
to
alban
s
and
died
in
a
few
days
after
which
all
went
well
with
crowland
and
the
norman
monks
who
worked
the
english
martyr
to
get
money
out
of
the
english
whom
they
had
enslaved
and
yet
so
strangely
mingled
for
good
and
evil
are
the
works
of
men
that
lying
brotherhood
of
crowland
set
up
in
those
very
days
for
pure
love
of
learning
and
of
teaching
learning
a
little
school
of
letters
in
a
poor
town
hard
by
which
became
under
their
auspices
the
university
of
cambridge
so
the
bells
of
crowland
were
restored
more
melodious
than
ever
and
richard
of
rulos
doubtless
had
his
share
in
their
restoration
and
that
day
they
were
ringing
with
a
will
and
for
a
good
reason
for
that
day
had
come
the
news
that
henry
plantagenet
was
crowned
king
of
england
lord
said
the
good
old
knight
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
this
day
at
last
he
sees
an
english
king
head
the
english
god
grant
said
the
old
lady
that
he
may
be
such
a
lord
to
england
as
thou
hast
been
to
if
he
will
be
and
better
far
will
he
be
by
god
s
grace
from
what
i
hear
of
him
than
ever
i
have
been
he
must
learn
that
which
i
learnt
from
thee
to
understand
these
englishmen
and
know
what
stout
and
trusty
prudhommes
they
are
all
down
to
the
meanest
serf
when
once
one
can
humor
their
sturdy
independent
and
he
must
learn
too
the
lesson
which
thou
didst
teach
me
when
i
would
have
had
thee
in
the
pride
of
youth
put
on
the
magic
armor
of
my
ancestors
and
win
me
fame
in
every
tournament
and
blessed
be
the
day
when
richard
of
rulos
said
to
me
if
others
dare
to
be
men
of
war
i
dare
more
for
i
dare
to
be
a
man
of
peace
have
patience
with
me
and
i
will
win
for
thee
and
for
myself
a
renown
more
lasting
before
god
and
man
than
ever
was
won
with
lance
do
you
remember
those
words
richard
mine
the
old
man
leant
his
head
upon
his
hands
it
may
be
that
not
those
words
but
the
deeds
which
god
has
caused
to
follow
them
may
by
christ
s
merits
bring
us
a
short
purgatory
and
a
long
amen
only
whatever
grief
we
may
endure
in
the
next
life
for
our
sins
may
we
endure
it
as
we
have
the
griefs
of
this
life
hand
in
amen
torfrida
there
is
one
thing
more
to
do
before
we
die
the
tomb
in
crowland
ever
since
the
fire
blackened
it
it
has
seemed
to
me
too
poor
and
mean
to
cover
the
dust
which
once
held
two
such
noble
souls
let
us
send
over
to
normandy
for
fair
white
stone
of
caen
and
let
carve
a
tomb
worthy
of
thy
and
what
shall
we
write
thereon
what
but
that
which
is
there
already
here
lies
the
last
of
the
not
so
we
will
write
here
lies
the
last
of
the
old
but
upon
thy
tomb
when
thy
time
comes
the
monks
of
crowland
shall
write
here
lies
the
first
of
the
new
english
who
by
the
inspiration
of
god
began
to
drain
the
