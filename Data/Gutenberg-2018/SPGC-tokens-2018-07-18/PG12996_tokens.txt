with

of
my
soul
chapter
i
the
revolution
of
spain
maintained
control
of
the
philippine
islands
for
more
than
three
centuries
and
a
half
during
which
period
the
tyranny
misconduct
and
abuses
of
the
friars
and
the
civil
and
military
administration
exhausted
the
patience
of
the
natives
and
caused
them
to
make
a
desperate
effort
to
shake
off
the
unbearable
galling
yoke
on
the
and
august
then
commencing
the
revolution
in
the
provinces
of
manila
and
cavite
on
these
memorable
days
the
people
of
balintawak
santa
mesa
kalookan
kawit
noveleta
and
san
francisco
de
malabon
rose
against
the
spaniards
and
proclaimed
the
independence
of
the
philippines
and
in
the
course
of
the
next
five
days
these
uprisings
were
followed
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
other
towns
in
cavite
province
joining
in
the
revolt
against
the
spanish
government
although
there
was
no
previous
arrangement
looking
to
a
general
revolt
the
latter
were
undoubtedly
moved
to
action
by
the
noble
example
of
the
former
with
regard
to
the
rising
in
the
province
of
cavite
it
should
be
stated
that
although
a
call
to
arms
bearing
the
signatures
of
don
augustin
rieta
don
candido
firona
and
myself
who
were
lieutenants
of
the
revolutionary
forces
was
circulated
there
was
no
certainty
about
the
orders
being
obeyed
or
even
received
by
the
people
for
it
happened
that
one
copy
of
the
orders
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
spaniard
named
don
fernando
parga
military
governor
of
the
province
who
at
that
time
was
exercising
the
functions
of
civil
governor
who
promptly
reported
its
contents
to
the
of
the
philippines
don
ramon
blanco
y
erenas
the
latter
at
once
issued
orders
for
the
spanish
troops
to
attack
the
revolutionary
forces
it
would
appear
beyond
doubt
that
one
whom
eye
of
man
hath
not
seen
in
his
wisdom
and
mercy
ordained
that
the
emancipation
of
the
oppressed
people
of
the
philippines
should
be
undertaken
at
this
time
for
otherwise
it
is
inexplicable
how
men
armed
only
with
sticks
and
wholly
unorganized
and
undisciplined
could
defeat
the
spanish
regulars
in
severe
engagements
at
bakoor
imus
and
noveleta
and
in
addition
to
making
many
of
them
prisoners
captured
a
large
quantity
of
arms
and
ammunition
it
was
owing
to
this
astonishing
success
of
the
revolutionary
troops
that
general
blanco
quickly
concluded
to
endeavour
to
maintain
spanish
control
by
the
adoption
of
a
conciliatory
policy
under
the
pretext
that
thereby
he
could
quel
the
rebellion
his
first
act
being
a
declaration
to
the
effect
that
it
was
not
the
purpose
of
his
government
to
oppress
the
people
and
he
had
no
desire
to
slaughter
the
the
government
of
madrid
disapproved
of
general
blanco
new
policy
and
speedily
appointed
don
camilo
polavieja
to
supersede
him
and
despatched
forthwith
a
large
number
of
regulars
to
the
philippines
general
polavieja
advanced
against
the
revolutionary
forces
with
men
armed
with
mausers
and
one
field
battery
he
had
scarcely
reconquered
half
of
cavite
province
when
he
resigned
owing
to
bad
health
that
was
in
april
polavieja
was
succeeded
by
the
veteran
general
don
fernando
primo
de
rivera
who
had
seen
much
active
service
as
soon
as
rivera
had
taken
over
command
of
the
forces
he
personally
led
his
army
in
the
assault
upon
and
pursuit
of
the
revolutionary
forces
and
so
firmly
as
well
as
humanely
was
the
campaign
conducted
that
he
soon
reconquered
the
whole
of
cavite
province
and
drove
the
insurgents
into
the
mountains
then
i
established
my
headquarters
in
the
wild
and
unexplored
mountain
fastness
of
where
i
formed
the
republican
government
of
the
philippines
at
the
end
of
may
chapter
ii
the
treaty
of
don
pedro
alejandro
paterno
who
was
appointed
by
the
spanish
sole
mediator
in
the
discussion
of
the
terms
of
peace
visited
several
times
to
negotiate
terms
of
the
treaty
which
after
negotiations
extending
over
five
months
and
careful
consideration
had
been
given
to
each
clause
was
finally
completed
and
signed
on
the
december
the
following
being
the
principal
conditions
that
i
would
and
any
of
my
associates
who
desired
to
go
with
me
be
free
to
live
in
any
foreign
country
having
fixed
upon
hongkong
as
my
place
of
residence
it
was
agreed
that
payment
of
the
indemnity
of
mexican
should
be
made
in
three
installments
namely
when
all
the
arms
in
were
delivered
to
the
spanish
authorities
when
the
arms
surrendered
amounted
to
eight
hundred
stand
the
final
payment
to
be
made
when
one
thousand
stand
of
arms
shall
have
been
handed
over
to
the
authorities
and
the
sung
in
the
cathedral
in
manila
as
thanksgiving
for
the
restoration
of
peace
the
latter
part
of
february
was
fixed
as
the
limit
of
time
wherein
the
surrender
of
arms
should
be
completed
the
whole
of
the
money
was
to
be
paid
to
me
personally
leaving
the
disposal
of
the
money
to
my
discretion
and
knowledge
of
the
understanding
with
my
associates
and
other
insurgents
prior
to
evacuating
the
remainder
of
the
insurgent
forces
under
primo
de
rivera
should
send
to
two
general
of
the
spanish
army
to
be
held
as
hostages
by
my
associates
who
remained
there
until
i
and
a
few
of
my
compatriots
arrived
in
hongkong
and
the
first
installment
of
the
money
payment
namely
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
was
paid
to
me
it
was
also
agreed
that
the
religious
corporations
in
the
philippines
be
expelled
and
an
autonomous
system
of
government
political
and
administrative
be
established
though
by
special
request
of
general
primo
de
rivera
these
conditions
were
not
insisted
on
in
the
drawing
up
of
the
treaty
the
general
contending
that
such
concessions
would
subject
the
spanish
government
to
severe
criticism
and
even
ridicule
general
primo
de
rivera
paid
the
first
installment
of
while
the
two
generals
were
hold
as
hostages
in
we
the
revolutionaries
discharged
our
obligation
to
surrender
our
arms
which
were
over
stand
as
everybody
knows
it
having
been
published
in
the
manila
newspapers
but
the
captain
general
primo
de
rivera
failed
to
fulfill
the
agreement
as
faithfully
as
we
did
the
other
installments
were
never
paid
the
friars
were
neither
restricted
in
their
acts
of
tyranny
and
oppression
nor
were
any
steps
taken
to
expel
them
or
secularize
the
religious
orders
the
reforms
demanded
were
not
inaugurated
though
the
was
sung
this
failure
of
the
spanish
authorities
to
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
caused
me
and
my
companions
much
unhappiness
which
quickly
changed
to
exasperation
when
i
received
a
letter
from
don
miguel
primo
de
rivera
nephew
and
private
secretary
of
the
general
informing
me
that
i
and
my
companions
could
never
return
to
manila
was
the
procedure
of
this
special
representative
of
spain
just
chapter
iii
negotiations
but
i
and
my
companions
were
not
to
be
kept
long
in
our
distress
grieving
over
the
bad
faith
of
the
spaniards
for
in
the
month
of
march
of
the
year
referred
to
some
people
came
to
me
and
in
the
name
of
the
commander
of
the
asked
for
a
conference
in
compliance
with
the
wishes
of
admiral
dewey
i
had
some
interviews
with
the
commander
during
the
evening
of
the
march
and
april
during
which
the
commander
urged
me
to
return
to
the
philippines
to
renew
hostilities
against
the
spaniards
with
the
object
of
gaining
our
independence
and
he
assured
me
of
the
assistance
of
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
war
between
the
united
states
and
spain
i
then
asked
the
commander
of
the
what
the
united
states
could
concede
to
the
filipinos
in
reply
he
said
united
states
is
a
great
and
rich
nation
and
needs
no
in
view
of
this
reply
i
suggested
to
the
commander
the
advisability
of
stating
in
writing
what
would
be
agreed
to
by
the
united
states
and
be
replied
that
he
would
refer
the
matter
to
admiral
dewey
in
the
midst
of
my
negotiations
with
the
commander
of
the
i
was
interrupted
by
letters
from
isabelo
artacho
and
his
solicitors
on
the
april
claiming
of
the
money
received
from
the
spanish
authorities
and
asserting
that
he
artacho
should
receive
this
sum
as
salary
due
to
him
while
acting
as
secretary
of
the
interior
he
having
been
it
was
alleged
a
member
of
the
filipino
government
established
in
these
letters
contained
the
threat
that
failure
to
comply
with
the
demand
of
artacho
would
result
in
him
bringing
me
before
the
courts
of
law
in
hongkong
it
may
make
the
matter
clearer
if
i
mention
at
this
point
that
isabelo
artacho
arrived
at
and
made
himself
known
to
and
mixed
with
the
officers
in
the
revolutionary
camp
on
the
day
of
september
and
was
appointed
secretary
of
the
interior
in
the
early
part
of
november
of
that
year
when
the
treaty
of
peace
proposed
and
negotiated
by
don
pedro
alejandro
paterno
was
almost
concluded
as
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
document
was
signed
on
the
of
december
of
that
year
in
the
light
of
these
facts
the
unjust
and
unreasonable
nature
of
the
claim
of
artacho
is
easily
discernable
for
it
is
monstrous
to
claim
for
services
rendered
to
the
revolutionary
government
during
such
a
brief
period
moreover
it
is
a
fact
that
it
was
agreed
between
ourselves
the
leaders
of
the
revolution
assembled
in
that
in
the
event
of
the
spaniards
failing
to
comply
with
each
and
every
one
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
agreement
the
money
obtained
from
the
spanish
government
should
not
be
divided
but
must
be
employed
in
the
purchase
of
arms
and
ammunition
to
renew
the
war
of
independence
it
is
therefore
evident
that
artacho
in
making
this
preposterous
demand
was
acting
as
a
spy
for
the
enemy
as
an
agent
of
general
primo
de
rivera
for
he
wanted
to
extinguish
the
rebellion
by
depriving
its
organizers
and
leaders
of
the
most
indispensable
element
the
sinews
of
war
which
is
money
this
was
the
view
too
of
the
whole
of
my
colleagues
and
it
was
resolved
by
us
that
i
should
leave
hongkong
immediately
and
thereby
avoid
the
litigation
which
artacho
seemed
bent
upon
and
thereby
afford
my
companions
time
and
opportunity
to
remove
this
new
and
wholly
unexpected
barrier
to
the
realization
of
our
cherished
plans
for
the
emancipation
of
our
beloved
fatherland
i
am
profoundly
pleased
to
say
that
they
succeeded
artacho
withdrawing
the
suit
through
a
transaction
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
the
meeting
above
referred
to
i
left
hongkong
quietly
on
the
april
on
board
the
steamship
and
after
calling
at
saigon
i
reached
singapore
as
a
passenger
by
the
landing
there
as
secretly
as
possible
on
the
april
i
at
once
proceeded
to
the
residence
of
one
of
my
countrymen
thus
is
explained
the
cause
of
the
interruption
of
the
vitally
important
negotiations
with
admiral
dewey
initiated
by
the
commander
of
the
but
man
proposes
and
god
disposes
is
a
proverb
which
was
verified
in
its
fullest
sense
on
this
occasion
for
notwithstanding
the
precautions
taken
in
my
journey
to
avoid
identification
yet
at
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
i
arrived
at
singapore
an
englishman
came
to
the
house
in
which
i
was
residing
and
in
a
cautious
manner
stated
that
the
united
states
consul
at
that
port
spencer
pratt
wished
to
have
an
interview
with
don
emilio
aguinaldo
the
visitor
was
told
that
in
that
house
they
did
not
know
aguinaldo
this
being
the
prearranged
answer
for
any
callers
but
the
englishman
returned
to
the
house
several
times
and
persisted
in
saying
that
it
was
no
use
trying
to
conceal
the
fact
of
arrival
for
consul
pratt
had
received
notice
from
admiral
dewey
of
general
aguinaldo
journey
to
singapore
in
reply
the
consul
said
he
would
telegraph
about
this
matter
to
admiral
dewey
who
was
he
said
of
the
squadron
which
would
invade
the
philippines
and
who
had
he
also
stated
full
powers
conferred
on
him
by
president
mckinley
between
or
in
the
forenoon
of
the
next
day
the
conference
was
renewed
and
pratt
then
informed
me
that
the
admiral
had
sent
him
a
telegram
in
reply
to
the
wish
i
had
expressed
for
an
agreement
in
writing
he
said
the
admiral
reply
was
the
united
states
would
at
least
recognize
the
independence
of
the
philippines
under
the
protection
of
the
united
states
navy
the
consul
added
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
entering
into
a
formal
written
agreement
because
the
word
of
the
admiral
and
of
the
united
states
consul
were
in
fact
equivalent
to
the
most
solemn
pledge
that
their
verbal
promises
and
assurance
would
be
fulfilled
to
the
letter
and
were
not
to
be
classed
with
spanish
promises
or
spanish
ideas
of
a
man
word
of
honour
in
conclusion
the
consul
said
the
government
of
north
america
is
a
very
honest
just
and
powerful
being
informed
of
what
had
been
said
by
the
visitor
i
consented
to
meet
consul
pratt
and
had
a
strictly
private
interview
with
him
between
and
on
april
in
one
of
the
suburbs
of
singapore
as
soon
as
pratt
met
me
he
said
that
war
had
been
formally
declared
by
the
united
states
against
spain
the
day
before
on
the
april
in
the
course
of
the
interview
alluded
to
consul
pratt
told
me
that
as
the
spaniards
had
not
fulfilled
the
promises
made
in
the
agreement
the
filipinos
had
the
right
to
continue
the
revolution
which
had
been
checked
by
the
arrangement
and
after
urging
me
to
resume
hostilities
against
the
spaniards
he
assured
me
that
the
united
states
would
grant
much
greater
liberty
and
more
material
benefits
to
the
filipinos
than
the
spaniards
ever
promised
i
then
asked
the
consul
what
benefits
the
united
states
would
confer
on
the
philippines
pointing
out
at
the
same
time
the
advisability
of
making
an
agreement
and
setting
out
all
the
terms
and
conditions
in
black
and
white
being
as
anxious
to
be
in
the
philippines
as
admiral
dewey
and
the
north
american
consul
to
renew
the
struggle
for
our
independence
i
took
the
opportunity
afforded
me
by
these
representatives
of
the
united
states
and
placing
the
fullest
confidence
in
their
word
of
honour
i
said
to
pratt
in
response
to
his
persistent
professions
of
solicitude
for
the
welfare
of
my
countrymen
that
he
could
count
upon
me
when
i
returned
to
the
philippines
to
raise
the
people
as
one
man
against
the
spaniards
with
the
one
grand
object
in
view
as
above
mentioned
if
i
could
take
firearms
with
me
to
distribute
amongst
my
countrymen
i
assured
him
that
i
would
put
forth
my
utmost
endeavours
to
crush
and
extinguish
the
power
of
spain
in
the
islands
and
i
added
that
if
in
possession
of
one
battery
of
a
dozen
i
would
make
the
spaniards
surrender
manila
in
about
two
weeks
the
consul
said
he
would
help
me
to
get
over
to
the
philippines
the
consignment
of
arms
in
respect
of
which
i
had
made
the
preliminary
arrangements
in
hongkong
and
he
added
that
he
would
at
once
telegraph
to
admiral
dewey
informing
him
of
this
promise
in
order
that
the
admiral
might
give
what
assistance
laid
in
his
power
to
make
the
expedition
in
question
a
success
on
the
april
the
last
conference
was
held
in
the
united
states
consulate
at
singapore
i
was
invited
by
the
consul
to
meet
him
on
this
occasion
and
as
soon
as
we
met
he
said
he
had
received
a
telegram
from
the
admiral
requesting
him
to
ask
me
to
proceed
to
hongkong
by
first
steamer
to
join
the
admiral
who
was
then
with
his
squadron
in
mir
bay
a
chinese
harbour
close
to
hongkong
i
replied
to
this
proposal
in
the
affirmative
and
gave
directions
to
my
to
at
once
procure
passages
for
myself
and
companions
care
being
taken
that
the
tickets
should
bear
the
assumed
names
we
had
adopted
on
the
occasion
of
our
journey
from
hongkong
to
singapore
it
being
advisable
that
we
should
continue
to
travel
on
the
april
i
called
on
consul
pratt
to
bid
him
adieu
on
the
eve
of
my
departure
from
singapore
by
the
steamship
the
consul
after
telling
me
that
when
i
got
near
the
port
of
hongkong
i
would
be
met
by
the
admiral
launch
and
taken
from
the
to
the
american
squadron
a
precaution
against
news
of
my
movements
becoming
public
property
of
which
i
highly
approved
then
asked
me
to
appoint
him
representative
of
the
philippines
in
the
united
states
there
to
zealously
advocate
official
recognition
of
our
independence
my
answer
was
that
i
would
propose
him
for
the
position
of
representative
of
the
philippines
in
the
united
states
when
the
philippine
government
was
properly
organized
though
i
thought
it
an
insignificant
reward
for
his
assistance
for
in
the
event
of
our
independence
becoming
fait
i
intended
to
offer
him
a
high
position
in
the
customs
department
besides
granting
certain
commercial
advantages
and
contributing
towards
the
cost
of
the
war
whatever
sum
he
might
consider
due
to
his
government
because
the
filipinos
had
already
decided
such
a
policy
was
the
natural
outcome
of
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
and
could
be
construed
only
as
a
right
and
proper
token
of
the
nation
gratitude
but
to
continue
the
statement
of
facts
respecting
my
return
to
hongkong
from
singapore
i
left
singapore
with
my
sres
pilar
and
leyba
bound
for
hongkong
by
the
arriving
at
hongkong
at
on
the
may
without
seeing
or
hearing
anything
of
the
launch
which
i
had
been
led
by
consul
pratt
to
expect
to
meet
me
near
the
entrance
of
hongkong
harbour
in
response
to
an
invitation
from
rounsevelle
wildman
united
states
consul
at
hongkong
i
wended
my
way
to
the
united
states
consulate
and
between
and
of
the
same
day
i
had
an
interview
with
him
wildman
told
me
that
admiral
dewey
left
for
manila
hurriedly
in
accordance
with
imperative
orders
from
his
government
directing
him
to
attack
the
spanish
fleet
he
was
therefore
unable
to
await
my
arrival
before
weighing
anchor
and
going
forth
to
give
battle
to
the
spaniards
wildman
added
that
admiral
dewey
left
word
with
him
that
he
would
send
a
gunboat
to
take
me
across
to
the
philippines
in
the
course
of
this
interview
with
wildman
i
spoke
to
him
about
the
shipment
of
arms
to
the
islands
which
i
had
previously
planned
with
him
and
it
was
then
agreed
among
ourselves
that
he
rounsevelle
wildman
and
the
filipino
teodoro
sandico
should
complete
the
arrangements
for
the
despatch
of
the
expedition
and
i
there
and
then
handed
to
and
deposited
with
them
the
sum
of
a
steam
launch
was
quickly
purchased
for
while
a
contract
was
made
and
entered
into
for
the
purchase
of
rifles
at
each
and
rounds
of
ammunition
at
and
per
a
week
later
may
the
american
arrived
from
manila
bringing
news
of
admiral
dewey
victory
over
the
spanish
fleet
but
did
not
bring
orders
to
convey
me
to
manila
at
that
night
i
had
another
interview
with
consul
wildman
at
his
request
on
the
of
the
same
month
the
again
arrived
at
hongkong
from
manila
this
time
bringing
orders
to
convey
me
and
my
companions
to
manila
i
was
promptly
notified
of
this
by
consul
wildman
who
requested
that
we
go
on
board
the
at
at
night
on
may
accompanied
by
consul
wildman
the
captain
of
the
and
john
barrett
who
then
usually
styled
himself
of
the
united
states
legation
in
siam
we
boarded
an
american
steam
launch
and
proceeded
to
chinese
kowloon
bay
where
the
was
anchored
while
bidding
us
adieu
barrett
said
he
would
call
on
me
in
the
philippines
which
he
did
later
on
in
cavite
and
malolos
wildman
strongly
advised
me
to
establish
a
dictatorship
as
soon
as
i
arrived
in
the
philippines
and
he
assured
me
that
he
would
use
his
best
endeavours
to
have
the
arms
already
contracted
for
delivered
to
me
in
the
philippines
which
he
in
fact
did
it
is
to
be
observed
though
that
the
first
expedition
having
been
conducted
satisfactorily
the
arms
reaching
me
in
due
course
i
was
naturally
grateful
and
had
confidence
in
the
sincerity
and
good
faith
of
consul
wildman
and
there
was
nothing
surprising
therefore
in
the
fact
that
i
asked
him
to
fit
out
another
expedition
and
caused
the
sum
of
to
be
deposited
with
him
for
that
purpose
i
regret
to
state
however
that
wildman
has
failed
to
comply
with
my
request
and
i
am
informed
that
he
refuses
to
refund
the
money
the
left
hongkong
at
on
the
may
and
arrived
off
cavite
manila
bay
between
noon
and
on
the
idem
no
sooner
had
the
dropped
anchor
than
the
admiral
launch
carrying
his
adjutant
and
private
secretary
came
alongside
to
convey
me
the
flagship
where
i
was
received
with
my
adjutant
leyba
with
the
honours
due
to
a
general
the
admiral
ushered
me
into
his
private
quarters
and
after
the
exchange
of
the
usual
greetings
i
asked
it
was
true
that
he
had
sent
all
the
telegrams
to
the
consul
at
singapore
pratt
which
that
gentleman
had
told
me
he
received
in
regard
to
myself
the
admiral
replied
in
the
affirmative
adding
that
the
united
states
had
come
to
the
philippines
to
protect
the
natives
and
free
them
from
the
yoke
of
spain
he
said
moreover
that
america
is
exceedingly
well
off
as
regards
territory
revenue
and
resources
and
therefore
needs
no
assuring
me
finally
that
was
no
occasion
for
me
to
entertain
any
doubts
whatever
about
the
recognition
of
the
independence
of
the
philippines
by
the
united
then
admiral
dewey
asked
me
if
i
could
induce
the
people
to
rise
against
the
spaniards
and
make
a
short
sharp
and
decisive
campaign
of
it
i
said
in
reply
that
events
would
speak
for
themselves
but
while
a
certain
arms
expedition
respecting
which
consul
wildman
was
duly
informed
that
it
would
be
despatched
from
a
chinese
port
was
delayed
in
china
we
could
do
nothing
because
without
arms
every
victory
would
assuredly
cost
us
the
lives
of
many
brave
and
dashing
filipino
warriors
the
admiral
thereupon
offered
to
despatch
a
steamer
to
hurry
up
the
expedition
this
be
it
borne
in
mind
in
addition
to
the
general
orders
he
had
given
the
consul
to
assist
us
to
procure
arms
and
ammunition
then
he
at
once
placed
at
my
disposal
all
the
guns
seized
onboard
the
spanish
warships
as
well
as
mausers
and
a
good
many
rounds
of
ammunition
which
had
been
brought
up
from
corregidor
island
by
the
i
then
availed
myself
of
an
early
opportunity
to
express
to
the
admiral
my
deep
gratitude
for
the
assistance
rendered
to
the
people
of
the
philippines
by
the
united
states
as
well
as
my
unbounded
admiration
of
the
grandeur
and
beneficence
of
the
american
people
i
also
candidly
informed
the
admiral
that
before
i
left
hongkong
the
filipinos
residing
in
that
colony
hold
a
meeting
at
which
the
following
question
was
fully
discussed
namely
possibility
that
after
the
spaniards
were
defeated
and
their
power
and
prestige
in
the
islands
destroyed
the
filipinos
might
have
to
wage
war
against
the
united
states
owing
to
the
american
government
declining
to
recognize
our
independence
in
that
event
the
americans
it
was
generally
agreed
would
be
sure
to
defeat
us
for
they
would
find
us
worn
out
and
short
of
ammunition
owing
to
our
struggle
with
the
spaniards
i
concluded
by
asking
the
gallant
admiral
to
excuse
me
for
an
amount
of
frankness
that
night
appear
to
border
on
impudence
and
assured
him
of
the
fact
that
i
was
actuated
only
by
a
desire
to
have
a
perfectly
clear
understanding
in
the
interest
of
both
admiral
said
he
was
very
glad
to
have
this
evidence
of
our
earnestness
and
straightforwardness
and
he
thought
the
filipinos
and
americans
should
act
towards
one
another
as
friends
and
allies
and
therefore
it
was
right
and
proper
that
all
doubts
should
be
expressed
frankly
in
order
that
explanations
be
made
difficulties
avoided
and
distrust
removed
adding
that
as
he
had
already
united
states
would
unquestionably
recognize
the
independence
of
the
people
of
the
philippines
guaranteed
as
it
was
by
the
word
of
honour
of
he
said
is
more
positive
more
irrevocable
than
any
written
agreement
which
might
not
be
regarded
as
binding
when
there
is
an
intention
or
desire
to
repudiate
it
as
was
the
case
in
respect
of
the
compact
made
with
the
spaniards
at
then
the
admiral
advised
me
to
at
once
have
made
a
filipino
national
flag
which
he
said
he
would
recognize
and
protect
in
the
presence
of
the
other
nations
represented
by
the
various
squadrons
anchored
in
manila
bay
adding
however
that
he
thought
it
advisable
that
we
should
destroy
the
power
of
spain
before
hoisting
our
national
flag
in
order
that
the
act
would
appear
more
important
and
creditable
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
of
the
united
states
in
particular
then
when
the
filipino
vessels
passed
to
and
fro
with
the
national
flag
fluttering
in
the
breeze
they
would
attract
more
attention
and
be
more
likely
to
induce
respect
for
the
national
i
again
thanked
the
admiral
for
his
good
advice
and
generous
offers
giving
him
to
understand
clearly
that
i
was
willing
to
sacrifice
my
own
life
if
he
would
be
thereby
more
exalted
in
the
estimation
of
the
united
states
more
honoured
by
his
i
added
that
under
the
present
conditions
of
hearty
good
fellowship
and
a
clear
understanding
the
whole
nation
would
respond
to
the
call
to
arms
to
shake
off
the
yoke
of
spain
and
obtain
their
freedom
by
destroying
the
power
of
spain
in
all
parts
of
the
archipelago
if
however
all
did
not
at
once
join
in
the
movement
that
should
not
cause
surprise
for
there
would
be
many
unable
to
assist
owing
to
lack
of
arms
and
ammunition
while
others
again
might
be
reluctant
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
campaign
on
account
of
the
loss
and
inconvenience
to
themselves
and
families
that
would
result
from
open
hostility
to
the
spaniards
thus
ended
my
first
interview
with
admiral
dewey
to
whom
i
signified
my
intention
to
reside
for
a
while
at
the
headquarters
of
the
naval
commandant
of
cavite
arsenal
chapter
iv
the
revolution
of
i
returned
to
the
to
give
directions
for
the
landing
of
the
luggage
and
which
i
brought
over
with
me
from
hongkong
on
my
way
to
the
i
met
several
of
my
old
associates
in
the
revolution
who
had
come
over
from
bataan
province
to
these
friends
i
gave
two
letters
directing
the
people
of
that
province
and
zambales
to
rise
against
the
spaniards
and
vigorously
attack
them
before
returning
to
the
arsenal
and
when
near
the
landing
place
i
came
across
several
large
open
boats
loaded
with
revolutionists
of
kawit
my
who
told
me
they
had
been
looking
out
for
me
for
about
two
weeks
the
americans
having
announced
that
i
would
soon
return
to
the
islands
the
feeling
of
joy
which
i
experienced
on
the
occasion
of
this
reunion
with
my
own
kith
and
kin
people
who
had
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
me
in
the
desperate
struggles
of
the
revolution
is
simply
indescribable
words
fail
to
express
my
feelings
joy
mingled
with
sadness
and
strong
determination
to
accomplish
the
salvation
the
emancipation
of
my
beloved
countrymen
hardly
had
i
set
foot
in
the
naval
headquarters
at
cavite
at
in
the
afternoon
than
i
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
to
give
these
faithful
adherents
orders
similar
to
those
despatched
to
bataan
and
zambales
i
was
engaged
the
whole
of
that
night
with
my
companions
drawing
up
orders
and
circulars
for
the
above
mentioned
purpose
we
were
also
kept
very
busy
replying
to
letters
which
were
pouring
in
from
all
sides
asking
for
news
respecting
the
reported
return
of
myself
to
the
islands
and
requesting
definite
instructions
regarding
a
renewal
of
hostilities
against
the
spaniards
that
the
invisible
albeit
irresistible
hand
of
providence
was
guiding
every
movement
and
beneficently
favouring
all
efforts
to
rid
the
country
of
the
detestable
foreign
yoke
is
fairly
evidenced
by
the
rapid
sequence
of
events
above
recorded
for
in
no
other
way
can
one
account
for
the
wonderful
celebrity
with
which
news
of
my
projected
return
spread
far
and
wide
volunteers
organized
and
armed
by
the
spaniards
with
mausers
and
remingtons
from
san
roque
and
caridad
placed
themselves
under
my
orders
at
first
the
americans
apprehended
some
danger
from
the
presence
of
this
armed
force
which
was
promptly
placed
on
guard
at
the
entrance
to
the
arsenal
when
i
heard
of
this
i
went
down
and
gave
them
orders
to
occupy
dalajican
thereby
preventing
the
spaniards
from
carrying
out
their
intention
to
approach
cavite
by
that
route
when
the
americans
were
informed
of
what
i
had
done
they
were
reassured
and
orders
were
given
to
the
captain
of
the
to
hand
over
to
me
the
rifles
and
ammunition
which
admiral
dewey
had
kindly
promised
about
the
launch
landed
the
arms
and
ammunition
in
question
at
the
arsenal
and
no
time
was
lost
in
distributing
the
arms
among
the
men
who
were
by
this
time
coming
in
ever
increasing
numbers
to
offer
their
services
to
me
and
expressing
their
willingness
to
be
armed
and
assigned
for
duty
at
the
outposts
and
on
the
firing
line
during
the
evening
of
the
may
the
old
revolutionary
officer
luciano
san
miguel
now
a
general
in
command
of
a
brigade
came
to
me
and
asked
for
orders
which
were
given
to
him
to
effect
the
uprising
of
the
provinces
of
manila
laguna
batangas
tayabas
bulakan
morong
pampanga
tarlak
newva
ecija
and
other
northern
provinces
he
left
the
same
night
to
execute
the
orders
during
the
and
and
subsequent
days
of
that
month
my
headquarters
were
simply
besieged
by
my
countrymen
who
poured
into
cavite
from
all
sides
to
offer
their
services
in
the
impending
struggle
with
the
spaniards
to
such
an
extent
indeed
were
my
quarters
in
the
arsenal
invaded
that
i
soon
found
it
necessary
to
repair
to
another
house
in
the
town
leaving
the
place
entirely
at
the
disposal
of
the
marines
who
were
then
in
charge
of
and
guarding
cavite
arsenal
chapter
v
the
dictatorial
government
on
the
may
a
dictatorial
government
was
established
my
first
proclamation
being
issued
that
day
announcing
the
system
of
government
then
adopted
and
stating
that
i
had
assumed
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
head
of
such
government
several
copies
of
this
proclamation
were
delivered
to
admiral
dewey
and
through
the
favour
of
his
good
offices
forwarded
to
the
representatives
of
the
foreign
powers
then
residing
in
manila
notwithstanding
our
lack
of
intercourse
with
manila
a
few
days
later
the
dictatorial
government
was
removed
to
the
house
formerly
occupied
by
the
spanish
civil
governor
of
cavite
because
owing
to
the
great
number
of
visitors
from
the
provinces
and
the
rapid
increase
of
work
the
accommodation
in
the
private
house
was
wholly
inadequate
and
too
cramped
it
was
while
quartered
in
the
first
mentioned
house
that
glad
tidings
reached
me
of
the
arrival
at
cavite
of
the
arms
expedition
the
whole
cargo
consisting
of
rifles
and
rounds
of
ammunition
besides
other
special
munitions
of
war
was
landed
at
the
very
same
dock
of
the
arsenal
and
was
witnessed
by
the
i
immediately
despatched
a
commission
to
convey
to
the
admiral
my
thanks
for
the
trouble
he
had
taken
in
sending
to
hurry
up
the
expedition
i
also
caused
my
commissioners
to
inform
the
admiral
that
i
had
fixed
the
may
as
the
day
when
the
revolutionary
forces
should
make
a
general
attack
upon
the
spaniards
the
admiral
returned
the
compliment
by
sending
his
secretary
to
congratulate
me
and
my
government
upon
the
activity
and
enthusiasm
displayed
in
preparing
for
the
campaign
but
he
suggested
that
it
was
advisable
to
postpone
the
opening
of
the
campaign
to
a
later
date
in
order
that
the
insurgent
troops
might
be
better
organized
and
better
drilled
i
replied
to
the
admiral
through
his
secretary
that
there
was
no
cause
for
any
anxiety
for
everything
would
be
in
perfect
readiness
by
the
and
moreover
that
the
filipinos
were
very
anxious
to
free
themselves
from
the
galling
spanish
yoke
that
they
would
therefore
fight
and
my
troops
would
make
up
for
any
deficiency
in
discipline
by
a
display
of
fearlessness
and
determination
to
defeat
the
common
enemy
which
would
go
far
to
ensure
success
i
was
i
added
nevertheless
profoundly
grateful
to
the
admiral
for
his
friendly
advice
i
promptly
gave
orders
for
the
distribution
of
the
arms
which
had
just
arrived
sending
some
to
various
provinces
and
reserving
the
remainder
for
the
revolutionaries
of
kawit
the
latter
being
smuggled
into
the
district
of
alapang
during
the
night
of
may
chapter
vi
the
first
triumphs
the
next
day
may
just
when
we
were
distributing
arms
to
the
revolutionists
of
kawit
in
the
above
mentioned
district
a
column
composed
of
over
spanish
naval
infantry
appeared
in
sight
they
were
sent
out
by
the
spanish
general
peña
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
the
said
consignment
of
arms
then
it
was
that
the
first
engagement
of
the
revolution
of
which
may
be
rightly
styled
a
continuation
of
the
campaign
of
took
place
the
battle
raged
from
to
when
the
spaniards
ran
out
of
ammunition
and
surrendered
with
all
their
arms
to
the
filipino
revolutionists
who
took
their
prisoners
to
cavite
in
commemoration
of
this
glorious
achievement
i
hoisted
our
national
flag
in
presence
of
a
great
crowd
who
greeted
it
with
tremendous
applause
and
loud
spontaneous
and
prolonged
cheers
for
independent
philippines
and
for
the
generous
nation
the
united
states
of
america
several
officers
and
marines
from
the
american
fleet
who
witnessed
the
ceremony
evinced
sympathy
with
the
filipino
cause
by
joining
in
the
natural
and
popular
rejoicings
of
the
people
this
glorious
triumph
was
merely
the
prelude
to
a
succession
of
brilliant
victories
and
when
the
may
came
the
date
fixed
for
general
uprising
of
the
whole
of
the
philippines
the
people
rose
as
one
man
to
crush
the
power
of
spain
the
second
triumph
was
effected
in
binakayan
at
a
place
known
as
where
the
spanish
garrison
consisting
of
about
men
was
attacked
by
our
raw
levvies
and
surrendered
in
a
few
hours
their
stock
of
ammunition
being
completely
exhausted
i
again
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
to
hoist
our
national
flag
and
did
so
from
an
upper
story
of
the
facing
the
sea
with
the
object
of
causing
the
sacred
insignia
of
our
liberty
and
independence
to
be
seen
fluttering
in
the
breeze
by
the
warships
representing
all
the
great
and
civilized
nations
of
the
world
which
were
congregated
in
the
harbour
observing
the
providential
evolution
going
on
in
the
philippines
after
upwards
of
three
hundred
years
of
spanish
domination
scarcely
had
another
hour
elapsed
before
another
flag
was
seen
flying
over
the
steeple
of
the
church
at
bakoor
which
is
also
in
full
view
of
vessels
in
the
harbour
being
the
signal
of
another
triumph
of
our
troops
over
the
spanish
forces
which
held
that
town
the
garrison
consisted
of
about
men
who
surrendered
to
the
revolutionary
army
when
their
ammunition
was
exhausted
and
so
the
revolution
progressed
triumph
following
triumph
in
quick
succession
evidencing
the
power
resolution
and
ability
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
philippines
to
rid
themselves
of
any
foreign
yoke
and
exist
as
an
independent
state
as
i
affirmed
to
admiral
dewey
and
in
respect
of
which
he
and
several
american
commanders
and
officers
warmly
congratulated
me
specially
mentioning
the
undeniable
triumphs
of
the
philippine
army
as
demonstrated
and
proved
by
the
great
number
of
prisoners
we
brought
into
cavite
from
all
parts
of
luzon

hoisted
the
national
flag
the
marines
of
the
filipino
flotilla
being
the
first
to
execute
that
order
our
little
flotilla
consisted
of
some
eight
spanish
steam
launches
which
had
been
captured
and
five
vessels
of
greater
dimensions
namely
the
baldyan
taal
and
these
vessels
were
presented
to
the
philippine
government
by
their
native
owners
and
were
converted
by
us
at
our
arsenal
into
gunboats
and
centimetre
guns
taken
from
the
spanish
being
mounted
on
board
ah
what
a
beautiful
inspiring
joyous
sight
that
flag
was
fluttering
in
the
breeze
from
the
topmasts
of
our
vessels

side
as
it
were
with
the
ensigns
of

among
whose
mighty
warships
our
little
cruisers
passed
to
and
fro
dipping
their
colours
the
ensign
of
liberty
and
independence
with
what
reverence
and
adoration
it
was
viewed
as
it
suddenly
rose
in
its
stately
loneliness
crowning
our
victories
and
as
it
were
smiling
approvingly
upon
the
undisciplined
philippine
army
in
the
moment
of
its
triumphs
over
the
regular
forces
of
the
spanish
government
heart
swells
and
throbs
again
with
the
emotions
of
extreme
delight
the
soul
is
filled
with
pride
and
the
goal
of
patriotism
seems
reached
in
the
midst
of
such
a
magnificent
spectacle
at
the
end
of
june
i
called
on
admiral
dewey
who
after
complimenting
me
on
rapid
triumphs
of
the
philippine
told
me
he
had
been
asked
by
the
german
and
french
admirals
why
he
allowed
the
filipinos
to
display
on
their
vessels
a
flag
that
was
not
recognized
admiral
dewey
said
his
reply
to
the
french
and
german
admirals
was
with
knowledge
and
consent
the
filipinos
used
that
and
apart
from
this
he
was
of
opinion
that
in
view
of
the
courage
and
steadfastness
of
purpose
displayed
in
the
war
against
the
spaniards
the
filipinos
deserved
the
right
to
use
their
flag
i
thereupon
expressed
to
the
admiral
my
unbounded
gratitude
for
such
unequivocal
protection
and
on
returning
to
the
shore
immediately
ordered
the
philippine
flotilla
to
convey
troops
to
the
other
provinces
of
luzon
and
to
the
southern
islands
to
wage
war
against
the
spaniards
who
garrisoned
them

the
expedition
to

was
a
complete
success
as
far
as
the
conveyance
of
our
troops
to
the
chief
strategic
points
was
concerned
our

so
much

at
once
mounted
on

this

and
she
was
loaded
with
troops
and
despatched
for
olongapo
but
she
had
not
gone
far
before
i
sent
another
gunboat
to
recall
her
because
admiral
dewey
requested
me
to
do
so
in
order
that
a
question
raised
by
the
french
consul
might
be
duly
settled
the
admiral
having
been
informed
that
when
captured
the
de
was
flying
the
spanish
flag
abstained
from
interfering
in
the
matter
and
handed
the
french
consul
protest
over
to
me
affirming
at
the
same
time
that
and
his
forces
were
in
no
way
concerned
in
the
this
incident
which
was
soon
settled
clearly
demonstrates
the
recognition
of
and
protection
extended
to
the
philippine
revolution
by
admiral
dewey
the
as
this
steamer
has
since
been
styled

again
despatched
to
olongapo
and
on
her
way
back
landed
troops
in
the
provinces

for
the
purpose
of
wresting
the
government
of
those
districts

more
recently
been
changed

at
present
ashore
in

owing
to
some
damage

this
act
in
conformity
with
the
rules

international
courtesy
a
demonstration
of

the
prisoners
and
arms
on

latter
however

demanded

should
give
back
the
prisoners
to
him

distinguished
general
called
on
me
in
the
filipino
government
house
at
cavite
an
honour
and
courtesy
which
i
promptly
returned
as
was
right
and
proper
seeing
that
we
were
friends
of
equal
rank
and
allies
in
the
course
of
official
intercourse
general
anderson
solemnly
and
completely
endorsed
the
promises
made
by
admiral
dewey
to
me
asserting
on
his
word
of
honour
that
america
had
not
come
to
the
philippines
to
wage
war
against
the
natives
nor
to
conquer
and
retain
territory
but
only
to
liberate
the
people
from
the
oppression
of
the
spanish
government

days

military
expedition

consented
to
the
movement
of
troops
as
proposed
during
that
month
july
admiral
dewey
accompanied
by
general
anderson
visited
cavite
and
after
the
usual
exchange
of
courtesies
he
said
you
have
had
ocular
demonstration
and
confirmation
of
all
i
have
told
you
and
promised
you
how
pretty
your
flag
is
it
has
a
triangle
and
is
something
like
the
cubans
will
you
give
me
one
as
a
memento
when
i
go
back
home
i
replied
that
i
was
fully
satisfied
with
his
word
of
honour
and
of
the
needlessness
of
having
our
agreement
in
documentary
form
as
to
the
flag
he
wanted
he
could
have
one
whenever
he
wished
the
admiral
continued
are
useless
when
there
is
no
sense
of
honour
on
one
side
as
was
the
case
in
respect
of
the
compact
with
the
spaniards
who
failed
to
act
up
to
what
had
been
written
and
signed
have
faith
in
my
word
and
i
assure
you
that
the
united
states
will
recognize
the
independence
of
the
country
but
i
recommend
you
to
keep
a
good
deal
of
what
we
have
said
and
agreed
secret
at
present
i
further
request
you
to
have
patience
if
any
of
our
soldiers
insult
any
filipinos
for
being
volunteers
they
are
as
yet
i
replied
that
i
would
bear
in
mind
all
his
advice
regarding
cautiousness
and
that
with
respect
to
the
misconduct
of
the
soldiers
orders
had
already
been
issued
enjoining
forbearance
and
i
passed
the
same
remarks
to
the
admiral
about
unpleasantness
possibly
arising
through
lack
of
discipline
of
our
own
forces
chapter
xi
the
spanish
commission
at
this
juncture
the
admiral
suddenly
changed
the
topic
of
conversation
and
asked
why
do
the
people
in
manila
rise
against
the
spaniards
as
their
countrymen
in
the
provinces
have
done
is
it
true
that
they
accept
the
offered
by
general
augustin
with
a
representative
assembly
is
the
report
which
has
reached
me
true
that
a
filipino
commission
has
been
sent
from
manila
to
propose
to
you
the
acceptance
of
that
coupled
with
a
recognition
of
your
rank
of
general
as
well
as
recognition
of
the
rank
held
by
your
companions
the
people
of
manila
i
answered
are
quiet
because
they
have
no
arms
and
because
as
merchants
and
landlords
they
fear
that
their
valuable
properties
and
money
in
the
banks
will
be
confiscated
by
the
spaniards
if
they
rise
up
and
begin
burning
and
destroying
the
property
of
others
on
this
account
they
had
ostensibly
accepted
not
because
that
was
what
they
wanted
but
more
as
a
means
of
deceiving
the
spaniards
and
being
allowed
to
live
in
peace
but
i
am
confident
that
all
the
filipinos
in
manila
are
for
as
will
be
proved
the
very
day
our
troops
capture
manila
at
that
time
i
fully
expect
the
people
of
manila
will
join
with
us
in
raising
loud
cheers
for
the
independence
of
the
philippines
making
fresh
demonstrations
of
loyalty
to
our
government
i
also
told
him
it
was
true
that
a
mixed
commission
had
arrived
and
in
the
name
of
general
augustin
and
archbishop
nozaleda
made
certain
proposals
but
they
made
known
to
us
their
intention
to
adhere
to
our
cause
the
members
of
the
commission
said
the
spaniards
instructed
them
to
say
they
came
without
being
formally
appointed
or
by
the
spanish
authorities
in
what
they
should
say
representing
on
the
contrary
that
they
were
faithful
interpreters
of
the
sentiment
of
the
people
of
manila
and
that
they
had
good
reason
for
believing
that
if
i
was
willing
to
accept
general
augustin
and
archbishop
nozaleda
would
recognize
my
rank
of
general
and
that
of
my
companions
would
give
me
the
indemnity
agreed
upon
at
and
still
unpaid
as
well
as
liberal
rewards
for
and
salaries
to
the
members
of
a
popular
assembly
promises
which
the
commissioners
did
not
put
any
faith
in
though
some
of
them
held
the
opinion
that
the
money
should
be
accepted
because
it
would
reduce
the
funds
of
the
spanish
government
and
also
because
the
money
had
been
wrung
from
filipinos
the
commissioners
i
added
left
after
assuring
me
that
the
people
in
manila
would
rise
against
the
spaniards
if
supplied
with
arms
and
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
make
an
attack
on
manila
at
the
places
they
pointed
out
as
being
the
weakest
parts
of
the
spanish
defense
and
consequently
the
easiest
to
overcome
i
thanked
the
commission
for
their
loyalty
and
straightforwardness
told
them
they
would
be
given
an
escort
to
take
them
safely
back
to
the
spanish
lines
and
that
when
they
got
back
they
should
inform
those
who
had
sent
them
that
they
were
not
received
because
they
were
not
duly
accredited
and
that
even
if
they
had
brought
credentials
according
to
what
they
had
seen
and
heard
from
the
revolutionists

would
certainly
not
consider
much
less
accept
their
proposals
respecting
autonomy
because
the
filipino
people
had
sufficient
experience
to
govern
themselves
that
they
are
tired
of
being
victimised
and
subjected
to
gross
abuses
by
a
foreign
nation
under
whose
domination
they
have
no
wish
to
continue
to
live
but
rather
wish
for
their
therefore
the
spaniards
might
prepare
to
defend
their
sovereignty
for
the
filipino
army
would
vigorously
assault
the
city
and
with
unflagging
zeal
prosecute
the
siege
until
manila
was
captured
i
also
told
the
commissioners
to
tell
archbishop
nozaleda
that
he
was
abusing
the
privileges
and
authority
of
his
exalted
position
that
such
conduct
was
at
variance
with
the
precepts
of
his
holiness
the
pope
and
if
he
failed
to
rectify
matters
i
would
throw
light
on
the
subject
in
a
way
which
would
bring
shame
and
disgrace
upon
him
i
added
that
i
knew
he
and
general
augustin
had
commissioned
four
germans
and
five
frenchmen
to
disguise
themselves
and
assassinate
me
in
the
vain
hope
that
once
i
am
disposed
of
the
people
of
the
philippines
would
calmly
submit
to
the
sovereignty
of
spain
which
was
a
great
mistake
for
were
i
assassinated
the
inhabitants
of
the
philippines
would
assuredly
continue
the
struggle
with
greater
vigor
than
ever
other
men
would
come
forward
to
avenge
my
death
lastly
i
recommended
the
commissioners
to
tell
the
people
in
manila
to
go
on
with
their
trades
and
industries
and
be
perfectly
at
ease
about
our
government
whose
actions
were
guided
in
the
paths
of
rectitude
and
justice
and
that
since
there
were
no
more
friars
to
corrupt
the
civic
virtues
the
filipino
government
was
now
endeavouring
to
demonstrate
its
honesty
of
purpose
before
the
whole
world
there
was
therefore
no
reason
why
they
should
not
go
on
with
their
business
as
usual
and
should
not
think
of
leaving
manila
and
coming
into
the
camp
where
the
resources
were
limited
where
already
more
were
employed
than
was
necessary
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
government
and
the
army
and
where
too
the
lack
of
arms
was
sorely
felt
the
commissioners
asked
me
what
conditions
the
united
states
would
impose
and
what
benefits
they
would
confer
on
the
filipinos
to
which
i
replied
that
is
was
difficult
to
answer
that
question
in
view
of
the
secret
i
was
in
honour
bound
to
keep
in
respect
of
the
terms
of
the
agreement
contenting
myself
by
saying
that
they
could
learn
a
good
deal
by
carefully
observing
the
acts
equivalent
to
the
exercise
of
sovereign
rights
of
the
dictatorial
government
and
especially
the
occular
demonstrations
of
such
rights
on
the
waters
of
the
harbour
these
statements
which
were
translated
by
my
interpreter
leyba
made
such
an
impression
on
the
admiral
that
he
interrupted
asking
why
did
you
reveal
our
secret
do
you
mean
that
you
do
not
intend
to
keep
inviolate
our
well
understood
silence
and
watchword
i
said
in
reply
that
i
had
revealed
nothing
of
the
secret
connected
with
him
and
the
consul
the
admiral
then
thanked
me
for
my
cautiousness
bid
we
and
left
with
general
anderson
after
requesting
me
to
refrain
from
assaulting
manila
because
he
said
they
were
studying
a
plan
to
take
the
walled
city
with
their
troops
leaving
the
suburbs
for
the
filipino
forces
he
advised
me
nevertheless
to
study
other
plans
of
taking
the
city
in
conjunction
with
their
forces
which
i
agreed
to
do
chapter

more
american
troops
a
few
days
later
american
troops
arrived
and
with
them
came
general
merritt
the
admiral
secretary
and
two
officers
came
to
the
dictatoriat
government
and
asked
that
we
allow
them
to
occupy
our
trenches
at
maytubig
from
the
harbour
side
of
that
place
right
up
to
the
main
road
where
they
would
form
a
continuation
of
our
lines
at
pasay
and
singalong
this
i
also
agreed
to
on
account
of
the
solemn
promises
of
the
admiral
and
the
trust
naturally
placed
in
them
owing
to
the
assistance
rendered
and
recognition
of
our
independence
ten
days
after
the
americans
occupied
the
trenches
at
maytubig
this
move
being
well
known
by
the
spaniards
who
were
entrenched
at
the
magazine
in
san
antonio
abad
their
outposts
composed
of
a
few
men
only
were
surprised
by
the
spaniards
who
made
a
night
attack
on
them
they
had
barely
time
to
get
out
of
their
beds
and
fall
back
on
the
centre
abandoning
their
rifles
and
six
in
their
precipitate
retreat
the
firing
being
distinctly
heard
our
troops
immediately
rushed
to
the
assistance
of
our
friends
and
allies
repulsing
the
spaniards
and
recapturing
the
rifles
and
which
i
ordered
to
be
returned
to
the
americans
as
a
token
of
our
and
friendship
general
noriel
was
opposed
to
this
restitution
alleging
that
the
arms
did
not
belong
to
the
americans
since
the
filipino
troops
captured
them
from
the
spaniards
but
i
paid
no
attention
to
the
reasonable
opposition
of
my
general
and
gave
imperative
instructions
that
they
be
returned
to
the
americans
showing
thereby
clearly
and
positively
the
of
the
filipinos
the
said
rifles
and
with
a
large
quantity
of
ammunition
was
therefore
restored
to
those
who
were
then
our
allies
notwithstanding
the
fact
of
general

capturing
them
at
a
cost
of
many
lives
of
our
compatriots
later
on
more
american
reinforcements
arrived
and
again
admiral
dewey
through
his
secretary
asked
for
more
trenches
for
their
troops
averring
that
those
which
we
had
given
up
to
them
before
were
insufficient
we
at
once
agreed
and
their
lines
were
then
extended

in

general

succeeded
in
advancing

attacked

the

held

entered

the

to
the

were
not

the

a
mystery
that
was
cleared

details
of
the
capitulation
of
manila
by
general
jaudenes
in
accordance
with
terms
of
an
agreement
with
general
merritt
became
public
property
a
capitulation
which
the
american
generals
reserved
for
their
own
benefit
and
credit

contravention
of

with

final
combined
assault
on

capture

by
the
allied
forces
american
and
filipino
some
light
was
thrown
upon
this
apparently
inexplicable
conduct
of
the
american
commanders
by
the
telegrams
which
i
received
during
that
day
from
general
anderson
who
wired
me
from
maitubig
asking
me
to
issue
orders
forbidding
our
troops
to
enter
manila
a
request
which
i
did
not
comply
with
because
it
was
not
in
conformity
with
the
agreement
and
it
was
moreover
diametrically
opposed
to
the
high
ends
of
the
revolutionary
government
that
after
going
to
the
trouble
of
besieging
manila
for
two
months
and
a
half
sacrificing
thousands
of
lives
and
millions
of
material
interests
it
should
be
supposed
such
sacrifices
were
made
with
any
other
object
in
view
than
the
capture
of
manila
and
the
spanish
garrison
which
stubbornly
defended
the
city
but
general
merritt
persistent
in
his
designs
begged
me
not
only
through
the
admiral
but
also
through
major
bell
to
withdraw
my
troops
from
the
suburbs
to
as
it
was
argued
prevent
the
danger
of
conflict
which
is
always
to
be
looked
for
in
the
event
of
dual
military
occupation
also
by
so
doing
to
avoid
bringing
ridicule
upon
the
american
forces
offering
at
the
same
time
in
three
letters
to
negotiate
after
his
wishes
were
complied
with
to
this
i
agreed
though
neither
immediately
nor
at
one
time
but
making
our
troops
retire
gradually
up
to
the
blockhouses
in
order
that
the
whole
of
the
inhabitants
of
manila
should
witness
the
proceedings
of
our
troops
and
amicability
toward
our
american
allies
up
to
that
time
and
in
fact
right
up
to
the
time
when
the
americans
openly
commenced
hostilities
against
us
i
entertained
in
my
soul
strong
hopes
that
the
american
commanders
would
make
absolute
with
their
government
the
verbal
agreement
made
and
entered
into
with
the
leader
of
the
philippine
revolution
notwithstanding
the
indications
to
the
contrary
which
were
noticeable
in
their
conduct
especially
in
respect
of
the
conduct
of
admiral
dewey
who
without
any
reason
or
justification
one
day
in
the
month
of
october
seized
all
our
steamers
and
launches
being
informed
of
this
strange
proceeding
and
at
the
time
when
the
revolutionary
government
had
its
headquarters
in
malolos
i
despatched
a
commission
to
general
otis
to
discuss
the
matter
with
him
general
otis
gave
the
commissioners
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
admiral
to
whom
he
referred
them
but
the
admiral
declined
to
receive
the
commission
notwithstanding
general
otis
recommendation
notwithstanding
the
procedure
of
the
american
commanders
so
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
all
the
compacts
and
antecedents
above
mentioned
i
continued
to
maintain
a
friendly
attitude
towards
them
sending
a
commission
to
general
merritt
to
bid
him
farewell
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
for
paris
in
his
acknowledgement
of
his
courtesy
general
merritt
was
good
enough
to
say
that
he
would
advocate
the
filipino
cause
in
the
united
states
in
the
same
manner
i
sent
to
admiral
dewey
a
in
a
solid
silver
scabbard
and
a
walking
stick
of
the
very
best
cane
with
gold
handle
engraved
by
the
most
skilful
silversmiths
as
a
souvenir
and
mark
of
our
friendship
this
the
admiral
accepted
thereby
in
some
measure
relieving
my
feelings
and
the
anxiety
of
my
compatriots
constituting
the
revolutionary
government
whose
hearts
were
again
filled
with
pleasant
hopes
of
a
complete
understanding
with
admiral
dewey
chapter
xv
vain
hopes
vain
indeed
became
these
hope
when
news
arrived
that
admiral
dewey
had
acted
and
was
continuing
to
act
against
the
revolutionary
government
by
order
of
his
excellency
mckinley
who
prompted
by
the
imperialist
party
had
decided
to
annex
the
philippines
granting
in
all
probability
concessions
to
adventurers
to
exploit
the
immense
natural
wealth
lying
concealed
under
our
virgin
soil
this
news
was
received
in
the
revolutionary
camp
like
a
thunderbolt
out
of
a
clear
sky
some
cursed
the
hour
and
the
day
we
treated
verbally
with
the
americans
some
denounced
the
ceding
of
the
suburbs
while
others
again
were
of
opinion
that
a
commission
should
be
sent
to
general
otis
to
draw
from
him
clear
and
positive
declarations
on
the
situation
drawing
up
a
treaty
of
amity
and
commerce
if
the
united
states
recognize
our
independence
or
at
once
commence
hostilities
if
the
states
refused
in
this
crisis
i
advised
moderation
and
prudence
for
i
still
had
confidence
in
the
justice
and
rectitude
of
united
states
congress
which
i
believed
would
not
approve
the
designs
of
the
imperialist
party
and
would
give
heed
to
the
declarations
of
admiral
dewey
who
in
the
capacity
of
an
exalted
representative
of
the
united
states
in
these
islands
concerted
and
covenanted
with
me
and
the
people
of
the
philippines
recognition
of
our
independence
in
fact
in
no
other
way
was
such
a
serious
matter
to
be
regarded
for
if
america
entrusted
to
admiral
dewey
the
honour
of
her
forces
in
such
a
distant
region
surely
the
filipinos
might
equally
place
their
trust
in
the
word
of
honour
of
such
a
polished
chivalrous
gentleman
and
brave
sailor
in
the
firm
belief
of
course
that
the
great
and
noble
american
people
would
neither
reject
his
decision
nor
expose
to
ridicule
the
illustrious
conqueror
of
the
spanish
fleet
in
the
same
way
the
not
less
known
and
notorious
circumstances
that
the
american
commanders
who
came
soon
after
the
echoes
of
the
victory
reached
their
native
shores
namely
generals
merritt
anderson
and
otis
proclaimed
to
the
people
of
the
philippines
that
america
not
come
to
conquer
territories
but
to
liberate
its
inhabitants
from
the
oppression
of
spanish
i
would
therefore
also
expose
to
universal
ridicule
and
contempt
the
honour
of
these
commanders
if
the
united

by
repudiating
their
official
and
public
acts

chapter

the
american
commission
with
such
prudent
as
well
as
well
founded
reflections
i
succeeded
in
calming
my
companions
shortly
before
the
official
news
arrived
reporting
that
the
washington
government
acting
on
admiral
suggestion
had
intimated
its
intention
to
despatch
a
civil
commission
to
manila
which
would
treat
with
the
filipinos
with
a
view
to
arriving
at
a
definite
understanding
respecting
the
government
of
the
islands
joy
and
satisfaction
now
filled
the
breasts
of
all
the
revolutionists
and
i
thereupon
set
about
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
meet
the
american
commissioners
at
the
same
time
i
gave
strict
orders
that
the
most
friendly
relations
should
be
maintained
with
the
americans
enjoining
toleration
and
overlooking
of
the
abuses
and
atrocities
of
the
soldiery
because
the
effect
on
the
commissioners
would
not
be
good
it
they
found
us
at
loggerheads
with
their
nation
forces
but
the
abases
of
the
americans
were
now
becoming
intolerable
in
the
at
arroceros
they
killed
a
woman
and
a
little
boy
under
the
pretext
that
they
were
surprising
a
gambling
den
thus
causing
the
greatest
indignation
of
a
great
concourse
of
people
in
that
vicinity
my
adjutants
too
who
hold
passes
permitting
them
to
enter
manila
with
their
uniform
and
sidearms
were
molested
by
being
repeatedly
stopped
by
every
patrol
they
met
it
being
perfectly
evident
that
the
intention
was
to
irritate
them
by
exposing
them
to
public
ridicule
while
this
sort
of
thing
was
going
on
as
against
our
people
the
american
commanders
and
officers
who
visited
our
camp
were
treated
with
the
utmost
courtesy
and
consideration

as
it
was
during

regime
while
the
american
soldiers
at
the
outposts
often
invaded
our
lines
thus
irritating
our
sentries

would
make
this
book
a
very
large
volume
if
i
continued
to
state
seriatim
the
abuses
and
atrocities
committed
by
the
american
soldiery
in
those
days

anxiety
it
seemed
as
if
the
abuses
were
authorised

at

winked
at
in
official
quarters
for
the
purpose
of
provoking
an
outbreak
of
hostilities
excitement
ran
high
among
all
classes
of
people
but
the
filipino
government
which
had
assumed
responsibility
for
the
acts
of
the
people
by
the
constant
issue
of
prudent
orders
succeeded
in
calming
the
excited

sufferers
to
be
patient
and
prudent

the
american
forces
to
commit
two
more
impolitic
acts
one
of
them
was
the
order
to
search
our
telegraph
offices
in
sagunro
street
in
tondo
where
the
searching
party
seized
the
apparatus
and
detained
the
officer
in
charge
reyna
in
the
fuerza
santiago
under
the
pretext
that
he
was
conspiring
against
the
americans
how
and
why
was
reyna
conspiring
was
not
this
sufficient
for
the
filipino
government
to
give
the
order
to
attack
and
rescue
reyna
and
thereby
we
eight
thousand
strong
be
plunged
immediately
into
war
with
the
united
states
was
there
any
reason
for
conspiring
when
the
power
was
in
our
own
hands
and
above
all
would
a
telegraphist
be
likely
to
interfere
in
de
when
there
was
an
army
near
by
to
attend
to
such
matters
it
was
abundantly
manifest
that
the
object
was
by
wounding
the
feelings
of
and
belittling
the
filipino
government
to
provoke
a
collision
and
it
was
clear
also
that
this
system
of
exasperating
us
was
not
merely
the
wanton
act
of
the
soldiery
but
was
actually
prompted
by
general
otis
himself
who
imbued
with
imperialistic
tendencies
regarded
the
coming
of
the
civil
commission
with
disfavour
and
especially
would
it
be
unsatisfactory
that
this
commission
should
find
the
philippines
in
a
state
of
perfect
tranquility
because
it
was
evident
to
the
said
general
as
well
as
to
the
whole
world
that
the
filipinos
would
assuredly
have
arrived
at
a
definite
amicable
agreement
with
the
aforesaid
commission
if
it
reached
the
islands
while
peace
prevailed
we
the
filipinos
would
have
received
the
commission
with
open
arms
and
complete
accord
as
honourable
agents
of
the
great
american
nation
the
commissioners
could
have
visited
all
our
provinces
seeing
and
taking
note
of
the
complete
tranquility
throughout
our
territory
they
could
have
seen
our
cultivated
lands
examined
our
constitution
and
investigated
the
administration
of
public
affairs
in
perfect
peace
and
safety
and
have
felt
and
enjoyed
the
inimitable
charm
of
our
oriental
style
half
negligent
half
solicitude
warmth
and
chilliness
simple
confidence
and
suspiciousness
characteristics
which
cause
descriptions
of
contact
with
us
to
be
depicted
by
foreigners
in
thousands
of
different
hues
ah
but
neither
did
general
otis
nor
the
imperialists
wish
for
such
a
landscape
it
was
better
for
their
criminal
designs
that
the
american
commission
should
view
the
desolation
and
horrors
of
war
in
the
philippines
inhaling
on
the
very
day
of
their
arrival
the
revolting
odour
emitted
from
american
and
filipino
corpses
it
was
better
for
their
purposes
that
that
gentleman
schurman
president
of
the
commission
should
return
from
manila
limiting
his
investigation
to
inquiries
among
the
few
filipinos
who
seduced
with
gold
were
siding
with
the
imperialists
it
were
better
for
them
that
the
commission
should
view
the
philippines
problem
through
fire
and
slaughter
in
the
midst
of
whizzing
bullets
and
the
uncontrolled
passion
of
infuriated
foes
thus
preventing
them
from
forming
correct
judgment
of
the
exact
and
natural
conditions
of
the
problem
ah
it
was
lastly
better
that
the
commission
return
to
the
states
defeated
in
its
mission
of
obtaining
peace
and
blaming
me
and
other
filipinos
for
its
inability
to
settle
matters
when
in
reality
i
and
all
the
philippine
people
were
longing
that
that
peace
had
been
concluded
yesterday
long
before
now
but
an
honest
and
honourable
peace
honourable
alike
for
the
united
states
and
the
philippine
republic
in
order
that
it
be
sincere
and
everlasting
the
second
impolitic
act
of
general
otis
was
the
issue
of
a
proclamation
on
the
of
january
asserting
in
the
name
of
president
mckinley
the
sovereignty
of
america
in
these
islands
with
threats
of
ruin
death
and
desolation
to
all
who
declined
to
recognize
it
i
emilio
aguinaldo
though
the
humble
servant
of
all
am
as
president
of
the
philippine
republic
charged
with
the
safeguarding
of
the
rights
and
independence
of
the
people
who
appointed
me
to
such
an
exalted
position
of
trust
and
responsibility
mistrusted
for
the
first
time
the
honour
of
the
americans
perceiving
of
course
that
this
proclamation
of
general
otis
completely
exceeded
the
limits
of
prudence
and
that
therefore
no
other
course
was
open
to
me
but
to
repel
with
arms
such
unjust
and
unexpected
procedure
on
the
part
of
the
commander
of
friendly
forces
i
protested
therefore
against
such
a
proclamation
also
threatening
an
immediate
rupture
of
friendly
relations
for
the
whole
populace
was
claiming
that
an
act
of
treason
had
been
committed
plausibly
asserting
that
the
announcement
of
the
commission
applied
for
by
admiral
dewey
was
a
ruse
and
that
what
general
otis
was
scheming
for
was
to
keep
us
quiet
while
he
brought
reinforcement
after
reinforcement
from
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
crashing
our
untrained
and
badly
equipped
army
with
one
blow
but
now
general
otis
acted
for
the
first
time
like
a
diplomatist
and
wrote
me
through
his
secretary
carman
a
letter
inviting
the
filipino
government
to
send
a
commission
to
meet
an
american
commission
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
an
amicable
arrangement
between
both
parties
and
although
i
placed
no
trust
in
the
professions
of
friendly
intentions
of
the
said
general
whose
determination
to
prevent
the
commission
arriving
at
a
peaceful
solution
of
the
difficulties
was
already
evident
i
acceded
to
the
request
partly
because
i
saw
the
order
dated
january
given
by
the
above
mentioned
general
confirmed
and
on
the
other
hand
to
show
before
the
whole
world
my
manifest
wishes
for
the
conservation
of
peace
and
friendship
with
the
united
states
solemnly
compacted
with
admiral
dewey
chapter
xviii
the
mixed
commission
conferences
of
the
mixed
commission
americans
and
filipinos
were
held
in
manila
from
the
to
the
of
the
said
month
of
january
the
filipino
commissioners
clearly
expressing
the
wish
of
our
people
for
recognition
as
an
independent
nation
they
also
frankly
stated
the
complaints
of
the
filipino
people
about
the
abuses
and
atrocities
of
the
american
soldiery
being
attentively
and
benevolently
listened
to
by
the
american
commissioners
the
latter
replied
that
they
had
no
authority
to
recognize
the
filipino
government
their
mission
being
limited
to
hearing
what
the
filipinos
said
to
collect
data
to
formulate
the
will
of
our
people
and
transmit
it
fully
and
faithfully
to
the
government
of
washington
who
alone
could
arrive
at
a
definite
decision
on
the
subject
these
conferences
ended
in
perfect
harmony
auguring
well
for
happier
times
and
definite
peace
when
mckinley
should
reply
to
general
telegrams
transmitting
our
wishes
with
his
favourable
recommendations
as
the
american
commissioners
said
chapter
xix
outbreak
of
hostilities
while
i
the
government
the
congress
and
the
entire
populace
were
awaiting
the
arrival
of
such
a
greatly
desired
reply
many
fairly
overflowing
with
pleasant
thoughts
there
came
the
fatal
day
of
the
february
during
the
night
of
which
day
the
american
forces
suddenly
attacked
all
our
lines
which
were
in
fact
at
the
time
almost
deserted
because
being
saturday
the
day
before
a
regular
feast
day
our
generals
and
some
of
the
most
prominent
officers
had
obtained
leave
to
pass
the
sabbath
with
their
respective
families
general
pantaleon
garcia
was
the
only
one
who
at
such
a
critical
moment
was
at
his
post
in
maypajo
north
of
manila
generals
noriel
rizal
and
ricarte
and
colonels
san
miguel
cailles
and
others
being
away
enjoying
their
leave
general
otis
according
to
trustworthy
information
telegraphed
to
washington
stating
that
the
filipinos
had
attacked
the
american
army
president
mckinley
read
aloud
the
telegram
in
the
senate
where
the
treaty
of
paris
of
the
december
was
being
discussed
with
a
view
to
its
ratification
the
question
of
annexation
of
the
philippines
being
the
chief
subject
of
debate
and
through
this
criminal
procedure
secured
the
acceptation
of
the
said
treaty
by
a
majority
of
only
three
votes
which
were
cast
simultaneously
with
a
declaration
that
the
voters
sided
with
the
ayes
on
account
of
war
having
broken
out
in
these
islands
this
singular
comedy
could
not
continue
for
a
great
length
of
time
because
the
filipinos
could
never
be
the
aggressors
as
against
the
american
forces
with
whom
we
had
sworn
eternal
friendship
and
in
whose
power
we
expected
to
find
the
necessary
protection
to
enable
us
to
obtain
recognition
of
our
independence
from
the
other
powers
the
confusion
and
obfuscation
of
the
first
moments
was
indeed
great
but
before
long
it
gave
place
to
the
light
of
truth
which
shone
forth
serene
bringing
forth
serious
reflections
when
sensible
people
studied
the
acts
of
mckinley
sending
reinforcement
after
reinforcement
to
manila
at
a
time
after
an
armistice
was
agreed
upon
and
even
when
peace
with
spain
prevailed
when
they
took
into
account
that
the
despatch
of
the
civil
commission
to
settle
terms
of
a
treaty
of
amity
with
the
filipinos
was
being
delayed
when
too
they
knew
of
the
antecedents
of
my
alliance
with
admiral
dewey
prepared
and
arranged
by
the
american
consuls
of
singapore
and
hongkong
pratt
and
wildman
when
they
became
acquainted
with
the
actual
state
of
affairs
on
the
february
knowing
that
the
filipinos
were
awaiting
the
reply
of
mckinley
to
the
telegram
of
general
otis
in
which
he
transmitted
the
peaceful
wish
of
the
filipino
people
of
live
as
an
independent
nation
when
lastly
they
riveted
their
attention
to
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
paris
the
approval
of
which
in
as
far
as
it
concerned
the
annexation
of
the
philippines
was
greeted
with
manifestations
of
joy
and
satisfaction
by
the
imperialist
party
led
by
mckinley
then
their
eyes
were
opened
to
the
revelations
of
truth
clearly
perceiving
the
base
selfish
and
inhuman
policy
which
mckinley
had
followed
in
his
dealings
with
us
the
filipinos
sacrificing
remorselessly
to
their
unbridled
ambition
the
honour
of
admiral
dewey
exposing
this
worthy
gentleman
and
illustrious
conqueror
of
the
spanish
fleet
to
universal
ridicule
for
no
other
deduction
can
follow
from
the
fact
that
about
the
middle
of
may
of
the
brought
me
with
my
revolutionary
companions
from
hongkong
by
order
of
the
above
mentioned
admiral
while
now
actually
the
united
states
squadron
is
engaged
in
bombarding
the
towns
and
ports
held
by
these
revolutionists
whose
objective
is
and
always
has
been
liberty
and
independence
the
facts
as
stated
are
of
recent
date
and
must
still
be
fresh
in
the
memory
of
all
those
who
in
may
admired
the
courage
of
admiral
dewey
sailors
and
the
humanitarianism
of
this
illustrious
commander
in
granting
visible
aid
to
an
oppressed
people
to
obtain
freedom
and
independence
surely
can
not
place
an
honest
construction
upon
the
present
inhuman
war
when
contrasting
it
with
those
lofty
and
worthy
sentiments
i
need
not
dwell
on
the
cruelty
which
from
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
hostilities
has
characterized
general
treatment
of
the
filipinos
shooting
in
secret
many
who
declined
to
sign
a
petition
asking
for
autonomy
i
need
not
recapitulate
the
ruffianly
abuses
which
the
american
soldiers
committed
on
innocent
and
defenseless
people
in
manila
shooting
women
and
children
simply
because
they
were
leaning
out
of
windows
entering
houses
at
midnight
without
the
occupants
permission
forcing
open
trunks
and
wardrobes
and
stealing
money
jewellery
and
all
valuables
they
came
across
breaking
chairs
tables
and
mirrors
which
they
could
not
carry
away
with
them
because
anyhow
they
are
consequences
of
the
war
though
improper
in
the
case
of
civilized
forces
but
what
i
would
not
leave
unmentioned
is
the
inhuman
conduct
of
that
general
in
his
dealings
with
the
filipino
army
when
to
arrange
a
treaty
of
peace
with
the
civil
commission
of
which
schurman
was
president
i
thrice
sent
emissaries
asking
for
a
cessation
of
hostilities
general
otis
refused
the
envoys
fair
and
reasonable
request
replying
that
he
would
not
stop
hostilities
so
long
as
the
philippine
army
declined
to
lay
down
their
arms
but
why
does
not
this
army
deserve
some
consideration
at
the
hands
of
general
otis
and
the
american
forces
had
they
already
forgotten
the
important
service
the
filipino
army
rendered
to
the
americans
in
the
late
war
with
spain
had
general
otis
forgotten
the
favours
conferred
on
him
by
the
filipino
army
giving
up
to
him
and
his
army
the
suburbs
and
blockhouses
which
at
such
great
sacrifice
to
themselves
the
filipinos
had
occupied
why
should
general
otis
make
such
a
humiliating
condition
a
prime
factor
or
basis
of
terms
of
peace
with
an
army
which
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
american
forces
freely
shedding
its
blood
and
whose
heroism
and
courage
were
extolled
by
admiral
dewey
and
other
americans
this
unexplained
conduct
of
general
otis
so
manifestly
contrary
to
the
canons
of
international
law
and
military
honour
is
eloquent
testimony
of
his
deliberate
intention
to
neutralize
the
effects
of
schurman
pacific
mission
what
peace
can
be
concerted
by
the
roaring
of
cannon
and
the
whizzing
of
bullets
what
is
and
has
been
the
course
of
procedure
of
general
brooke
in
cuba
are
not
the
cubans
still
armed
notwithstanding
negotiations
for
the
pacification
and
future
government
of
that
island
are
still
going
on
are
we
perchance
less
deserving
of
liberty
and
independence
than
those
revolutionists
oh
dear
philippines
blame
your
wealth
your
beauty
for
the
stupendous
disgrace
that
rests
upon
your
faithful
sons
you
have
aroused
the
ambition
of
the
imperialists
and
expansionists
of
north
america
and
both
have
placed
their
sharp
claws
upon
your
entrails
loved
mother
sweet
mother
we
are
here
to
defend
your
liberty
and
independence
to
the
death
we
do
not
want
war
on
the
contrary
we
wish
for
peace
but
honourable
peace
which
does
not
make
you
blush
nor
stain
your
forehead
with
shame
and
confusion
and
we
swear
to
you
and
promise
that
while
america
with
all
her
power
and
wealth
could
possibly
vanquish
us
killing
all
of
us
but
enslave
us
never
no
this
humiliation
is
not
the
compact
i
celebrated
in
singapore
with
the
american
consul
pratt
this
was
not
the
agreement
stipulated
for
with
wildman
american
consul
in
hongkong
finally
it
was
not
the
subjection
of
my
beloved
country
to
a
new
alien
yoke
that
admiral
dewey
promised
me
it
is
certain
that
these
three
have
abandoned
me
forgetting
that
i
was
sought
for
and
taken
from
my
exile
and
deportation
forgetting
also
that
neither
of
these
three
solicited
my
services
in
behalf
of
american
sovereignty
they
paying
the
expense
of
the
philippine
revolution
for
which
manifestly
they
sought
me
and
brought
me
back
to
your
beloved
bosom
if
there
is
as
i
believe
one
god
the
root
and
fountain
of
all
justice
and
only
eternal
judge
of
international
disputes
it
will
not
take
long
dear
mother
to
save
you
from
the
hands
of
your
unjust
enemies
so
i
trust
in
the
honour
of
admiral
dewey
so
i
trust
in
the
rectitude
of
the
great
people
of
the
united
states
of
america
where
if
there
are
ambitious
imperialists
there
are
defenders
of
the
humane
doctrines
of
the
immortal
monroe
franklin
and
washington
unless
the
race
of
noble
citizens
glorious
founders
of
the
present
greatness
of
the
north
american
republic
have
so
degenerated
that
their
benevolent
influence
has
become
subservient
to
the
grasping
ambition
of
the
expansionists
in
which
latter
unfortunate
circumstance
would
not
death
be
preferable
to
bondage
oh
sensible
american
people
deep
is
the
admiration
of
all
the
philippine
people
and
of
their
untrained
army
of
the
courage
displayed
by
your
commanders
and
soldiers
we
are
weak
in
comparison
with
such
titanic
instruments
of
your
government
ambitious
caesarian
policy
and
find
it
difficult
to
effectively
resist
their
courageous
onslaught
limited
are
our
warlike
resources
but
we
will
continue
this
unjust
bloody
and
unequal
struggle
not
for
the
love
of
war
which
we
abhor
but
to
defend
our
incontrovertible
rights
of
liberty
and
independence
so
dearly
won
in
war
with
spain
and
our
territory
which
is
threatened
by
the
ambitions
of
that
is
trying
to
subjugate
us
distressing
indeed
is
war
its
ravages
cause
us
horror
luckless
filipinos
succumb
in
the
confusion
of
combat
leaving
behind
them
mothers
widows
and
children
america
could
put
up
with
all
the
misfortunes
she
brings
on
us
without
discomfort
but
what
the
north
american
