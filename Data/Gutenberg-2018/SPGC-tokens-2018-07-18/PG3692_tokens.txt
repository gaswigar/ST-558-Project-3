a
sonnet
is
a
moment
monument
memorial
from
the
soul
eternity
to
one
dead
deathless
hour
look
that
it
be
whether
for
lustral
rite
or
dire
portent
of
its
own
arduous
fulness
reverent
carve
it
in
ivory
or
in
ebony
as
day
or
night
may
rule
and
let
time
see
its
flowering
crest
impearled
and
orient
a
sonnet
is
a
coin
its
face
reveals
the
soul
its
converse
to
what
power
is
due
whether
for
tribute
to
the
august
appeals
of
life
or
dower
in
love
high
retinue
it
serve
or
the
dark
wharf
cavernous
breath
in
charon
palm
it
pay
the
toll
to
death
love
enthroned
i
marked
all
kindred
powers
the
heart
finds
fair
truth
with
awed
lips
and
hope
with
eyes
upcast
and
fame
whose
loud
wings
fan
the
ashen
past
to
oblivion
flight
to
scare
and
youth
with
still
some
single
golden
hair
unto
his
shoulder
clinging
since
the
last
embrace
wherein
two
sweet
arms
held
him
fast
and
life
still
wreathing
flowers
for
death
to
wear
love
throne
was
not
with
these
but
far
above
all
passionate
wind
of
welcome
and
farewell
he
sat
in
breathless
bowers
they
dream
not
of
though
truth
foreknow
love
heart
and
hope
foretell
and
fame
be
for
love
sake
desirable
and
youth
be
dear
and
life
be
sweet
to
love
bridal
birth
as
when
desire
long
darkling
dawns
and
first
the
mother
looks
upon
the
child
even
so
my
lady
stood
at
gaze
and
smiled
when
her
soul
knew
at
length
the
love
it
nursed
born
with
her
life
creature
of
poignant
thirst
and
exquisite
hunger
at
her
heart
love
lay
quickening
in
darkness
till
a
voice
that
day
cried
on
him
and
the
bonds
of
birth
were
burst
now
shielded
in
his
wings
our
faces
yearn
together
as
his
fullgrown
feet
now
range
the
grove
and
his
warm
hands
our
couch
prepare
till
to
his
song
our
bodiless
souls
in
turn
be
born
his
children
when
death
nuptial
change
leaves
us
for
light
the
halo
of
his
hair
redemption
o
thou
who
at
love
hour
ecstatically
unto
my
lips
dost
evermore
present
the
body
and
blood
of
love
in
sacrament
whom
i
have
neared
and
felt
thy
breath
to
be
the
inmost
incense
of
his
sanctuary
who
without
speech
hast
owned
him
and
intent
upon
his
will
thy
life
with
mine
hast
blent
and
murmured
the
cup
remember
me
o
what
from
thee
the
grace
for
me
the
prize
and
what
to
love
the
glory
when
the
whole
of
the
deep
stair
thou
to
the
dim
shoal
and
weary
water
of
the
place
of
sighs
and
there
dost
work
deliverance
as
thine
eyes
draw
up
my
prisoned
spirit
to
thy
soul
lovesight
when
do
i
see
thee
most
beloved
one
when
in
the
light
the
spirits
of
mine
eyes
before
thy
face
their
altar
solemnize
the
worship
of
that
love
through
thee
made
known
or
when
in
the
dusk
hours
we
two
alone
and
eloquent
of
still
replies
thy
glimmering
visage
lies
and
my
soul
only
sees
thy
soul
its
own
o
love
my
love
if
i
no
more
should
see
thyself
nor
on
the
earth
the
shadow
of
thee
nor
image
of
thine
eyes
in
any
spring
how
then
should
sound
upon
life
darkening
slope
the
of
the
perished
leaves
of
hope
the
wind
of
death
imperishable
wing
heart
hope
by
what
word
power
the
key
of
paths
untrod
shall
i
the
difficult
deeps
of
love
explore
till
parted
waves
of
song
yield
up
the
shore
even
as
that
sea
which
israel
crossed
for
lo
in
some
poor
rhythmic
period
lady
i
fain
would
tell
how
evermore
thy
soul
i
know
not
from
thy
body
nor
thee
from
myself
neither
our
love
from
god
yea
in
god
name
and
love
and
thine
would
i
draw
from
one
loving
heart
such
evidence
as
to
all
hearts
all
things
shall
signify
tender
as
dawn
first
and
intense
as
instantaneous
penetrating
sense
in
spring
of
other
springs
gone
by
the
kiss
what
smouldering
senses
in
death
sick
delay
or
seizure
of
malign
vicissitude
can
rob
this
body
of
honour
or
denude
this
soul
of
worn
for
lo
even
now
my
lady
lips
did
play
with
these
my
lips
such
consonant
interlude
as
laurelled
orpheus
longed
for
when
he
wooed
the
hungering
face
with
that
last
lay
i
was
a
child
beneath
her
touch
a
man
when
breast
to
breast
we
clung
even
i
and
she
a
spirit
when
her
spirit
looked
through
me
a
god
when
all
our
met
to
fan
our
till
love
emulous
ardours
ran
fire
within
fire
desire
in
deity
sic
nuptial
sleep
at
length
their
long
kiss
severed
with
sweet
smart
and
as
the
last
slow
sudden
drops
are
shed
from
sparkling
eaves
when
all
the
storm
has
fled
so
singly
flagged
the
pulses
of
each
heart
their
bosoms
sundered
with
the
opening
start
of
married
flowers
to
either
side
outspread
from
the
knit
stem
yet
still
their
mouths
burnt
red
fawned
on
each
other
where
they
lay
apart
sleep
sank
them
lower
than
the
tide
of
dreams
and
their
dreams
watched
them
sink
and
slid
away
slowly
their
souls
swam
up
again
through
gleams
of
watered
light
and
dull
drowned
waifs
of
day
till
from
some
wonder
of
new
woods
and
streams
he
woke
and
wondered
more
for
there
she
lay
supreme
surrender
o
all
the
spirits
of
love
that
wander
by
along
the
fallowfield
of
sleep
my
lady
lies
apparent
and
the
deep
calls
to
the
deep
and
no
man
sees
but
i
the
bliss
so
long
afar
at
length
so
nigh
rests
there
attained
methinks
proud
love
must
weep
when
fate
control
doth
from
his
harvest
reap
the
sacred
hour
for
which
the
years
did
sigh
first
touched
the
hand
now
warm
around
my
neck
taught
memory
long
to
mock
desire
and
lo
across
my
breast
the
abandoned
hair
doth
flow
where
one
shorn
tress
long
stirred
the
longing
ache
and
next
the
heart
that
trembled
for
its
sake
lies
the
in
sovereign
overthrow
love
lovers
some
ladies
love
the
jewels
in
love
zone
and
darts
he
hath
for
painless
play
in
idle
scornful
hours
he
flings
away
and
some
that
listen
to
his
lure
soft
tone
do
love
to
deem
the
silver
praise
their
own
some
prize
his
blindfold
sight
and
there
be
they
who
kissed
his
wings
which
brought
him
yesterday
and
thank
his
wings
that
he
is
flown
my
lady
only
loves
the
heart
of
love
therefore
love
heart
my
lady
hath
for
thee
his
bower
of
unimagined
flower
and
tree
there
kneels
he
now
and
of
thine
eyes
in
shadowing
hair
above
seals
with
thy
mouth
his
immortality
passion
and
worship
one
brought
a
even
where
my
lady
and
i
lay
all
alone
saying
this
minstrel
is
unknown
bid
him
depart
for
i
am
minstrel
here
only
my
strains
are
to
love
dear
ones
dear
then
said
i
thine
hautboy
rapturous
tone
unto
my
lady
still
this
harp
makes
moan
and
still
she
deems
the
cadence
deep
and
clear
then
said
my
lady
art
passion
of
love
and
this
love
worship
both
he
plights
to
me
thy
mastering
music
walks
the
sunlit
sea
but
where
wan
water
trembles
in
the
grove
and
the
wan
moon
is
all
the
light
thereof
this
harp
still
makes
my
name
its
voluntary
the
portrait
o
lord
of
all
compassionate
control
o
love
let
this
my
lady
picture
glow
under
my
hand
to
praise
her
name
and
show
even
of
her
inner
self
the
perfect
whole
that
he
who
seeks
her
beauty
furthest
goal
beyond
the
light
that
the
sweet
glances
throw
and
refluent
wave
of
the
sweet
smile
may
know
the
very
sky
and
of
her
soul
lo
it
is
done
above
the
long
lithe
throat
the
mouth
mould
testifies
of
voice
and
kiss
the
shadowed
eyes
remember
and
foresee
her
face
is
made
her
shrine
let
all
men
note
that
in
all
years
o
love
thy
gift
is
this
they
that
would
look
on
her
must
come
to
me
the
warmed
by
her
hand
and
shadowed
by
her
hair
as
close
she
leaned
and
poured
her
heart
through
thee
whereof
the
articulate
throbs
accompany
the
smooth
black
stream
that
makes
thy
whiteness
fair
sweet
fluttering
sheet
even
of
her
breath
aware
oh
let
thy
silent
song
disclose
to
me
that
soul
wherewith
her
lips
and
eyes
agree
like
married
music
in
love
answering
air
fain
had
i
watched
her
when
at
some
fond
thought
her
bosom
to
the
writing
closelier
press
and
her
breast
secrets
peered
into
her
breast
when
through
eyes
raised
an
instant
her
soul
sought
my
soul
and
from
the
sudden
confluence
caught
the
words
that
made
her
love
the
loveliest
the
lovers
walk
sweet
twining
hedgeflowers
in
no
wise
on
this
june
day
and
hand
that
clings
in
hand
still
glades
and
meeting
faces
scarcely
fann
an
stream
that
draws
the
skies
deep
to
its
heart
and
mirrored
eyes
in
eyes
fresh
hourly
wonder
the
summer
land
of
light
and
cloud
and
two
souls
softly
with
one
heaven
of
smiles
and
sighs
even
such
their
path
whose
bodies
lean
unto
each
other
visible
sweetness
amorously
whose
passionate
hearts
lean
by
love
high
decree
together
on
his
heart
for
ever
true
as
the
firmamental
blue
rests
on
the
blue
line
of
a
foamless
sea
antiphony
love
you
sweet
how
can
you
ever
learn
how
much
i
love
you
i
love
even
so
and
so
i
learn
it
you
can
not
know
how
fair
you
are
fair
enough
to
earn
your
love
so
much
is
all
my
love
concern
love
grows
hourly
sweet
too
doth
grow
yet
love
seemed
full
so
many
hours
ago
thus
lovers
speak
till
kisses
claim
their
turn
ah
happy
they
to
whom
such
words
as
these
in
youth
have
served
for
speech
the
whole
day
long
hour
after
hour
remote
from
the
world
throng
work
contest
fame
all
life
confederate
pleas
what
while
love
breathed
in
sighs
and
silences
through
two
blent
souls
one
rapturous
undersong
youth
on
this
sweet
bank
your
head
thrice
sweet
and
dear
i
lay
and
spread
your
hair
on
either
side
and
see
the
newborn
wood
flowers
look
through
the
golden
tresses
here
and
there
on
these
borders
of
the
year
spring
foot
half
falters
scarce
she
yet
may
know
the
leafless
from
the
snow
and
through
her
bowers
the
wind
way
still
is
clear
but
april
sun
strikes
down
the
glades
so
shut
your
eyes
upturned
and
feel
my
kiss
creep
as
the
spring
now
thrills
through
every
spray
up
your
warm
throat
to
your
warm
lips
for
this
is
even
the
hour
of
love
sworn
suitservice
with
whom
cold
hearts
are
counted
castaway
sic
the
have
you
not
noted
in
some
family
where
two
were
born
of
a
first
how
still
they
own
their
gracious
bond
though
fed
and
nursed
on
the
forgotten
breast
and
knee
how
to
their
father
children
they
shall
be
in
act
and
thought
of
one
goodwill
but
each
shall
for
the
other
have
in
silence
speech
and
in
a
word
complete
community
even
so
when
first
i
saw
you
seemed
it
love
that
among
souls
allied
to
mine
was
yet
one
nearer
kindred
than
life
hinted
of
o
born
with
me
somewhere
that
men
forget
and
though
in
years
of
sight
and
sound
unmet
known
for
my
soul
well
enough
a
day
of
love
those
envied
places
which
do
know
her
well
and
are
so
scornful
of
this
lonely
place
even
now
for
once
are
emptied
of
her
grace
nowhere
but
here
she
is
and
while
love
spell
from
his
predominant
presence
doth
compel
all
alien
hours
an
outworn
populace
the
hours
of
love
fill
full
the
echoing
space
with
sweet
confederate
music
favourable
now
many
memories
make
solicitous
the
delicate
of
her
mouth
till
lit
with
quivering
fire
the
words
take
wing
from
it
as
here
between
our
kisses
we
sit
thus
speaking
of
things
remembered
and
so
sit
speechless
while
things
forgotten
call
to
us
beauty
pageant
what
at
the
heart
of
heaven
or
last
incarnate
flower
of
culminating
day
what
marshalled
marvels
on
the
skirts
of
may
or
song
sweet
june
encomiast
what
glory
of
change
by
nature
hand
can
vie
with
all
those
moods
of
varying
grace
which
one
loveliest
woman
form
and
face
within
this
hour
within
this
room
have
pass
love
very
vesture
and
elect
disguise
was
each
fine
movement
wonder
of
lily
or
swan
or
galiot
joy
to
his
sight
who
now
the
sadlier
sighs
parted
again
and
sorrow
yet
for
eyes
unborn
that
read
these
words
and
saw
her
not
genius
in
beauty
beauty
like
hers
is
genius
not
the
call
of
homer
or
of
dante
heart
sublime
not
michael
hand
furrowing
the
zones
of
time
is
more
with
compassed
mysteries
musical
nay
not
in
spring
or
summer
sweet
footfall
more
gathered
gifts
exuberant
life
than
doth
this
sovereign
face
whose
breathes
even
from
its
shadowed
contour
on
the
wall
as
many
men
are
poets
in
their
youth
but
for
one
soul
the
wires
prolong
even
through
all
change
the
indomitable
song
so
in
likewise
the
envenomed
years
whose
tooth
rends
shallower
grace
with
ruin
void
of
ruth
upon
this
beauty
power
shall
wreak
no
wrong
sic
silent
noon
your
hands
lie
open
in
the
long
fresh
grass
the
look
through
the
rosy
blooms
your
eyes
smile
peace
the
pasture
gleams
and
glooms
billowing
skies
that
scatter
and
amass
all
round
our
nest
far
as
the
eye
can
pass
are
golden
with
silver
edge
where
the
skirts
the
is
visible
silence
still
as
the
deep
in
the
growths
the
hangs
like
a
blue
thread
loosened
from
the
sky
so
this
wing
hour
is
dropt
to
us
from
above
oh
clasp
we
to
our
hearts
for
deathless
dower
this
inarticulate
hour
when
twofold
silence
was
the
song
of
love
gracious
moonlight
even
as
the
moon
grows
queenlier
in
when
the
sky
darkens
and
her
car
thrills
with
intenser
radiance
from
afar
so
lambent
lady
beams
thy
sovereign
grace
when
the
drear
soul
desires
thee
of
that
face
what
shall
be
said
which
like
a
governing
star
gathers
and
garners
from
all
things
that
are
their
silent
penetrative
loveliness
and
wild
waifs
of
spring
there
where
the
iris
rears
its
sheaf
with
flowering
rush
and
sceptred
so
have
i
marked
queen
dian
in
bright
ring
of
cloud
above
and
wave
below
take
wing
and
chase
night
gloom
as
thou
the
spirit
grief
sweet
dimness
of
her
loosened
hair
downfall
about
thy
face
her
sweet
hands
round
thy
head
in
gracious
fostering
union
garlanded
her
tremulous
smiles
her
glances
sweet
recall
of
love
her
murmuring
sighs
memorial
her
mouth
culled
sweetness
by
thy
kisses
shed
on
cheeks
and
neck
and
eyelids
and
so
led
back
to
her
mouth
which
answers
there
for
all
what
sweeter
than
these
things
except
the
thing
in
lacking
which
all
these
would
lose
their
sweet
the
confident
heart
still
fervour
the
swift
beat
and
soft
subsidence
of
the
spirit
wing
then
when
it
feels
in
cloud
girt
wayfaring
the
breath
of
kindred
plumes
against
its
feet
heart
haven
sometimes
she
is
a
child
within
mine
arms
cowering
beneath
dark
wings
that
love
must
chase
with
still
tears
showering
and
averted
face
inexplicably
filled
with
faint
alarms
and
oft
from
mine
own
spirit
hurtling
harms
i
crave
the
refuge
of
her
deep
embrace
against
all
ills
the
fortified
strong
place
and
sweet
reserve
of
sovereign
and
love
our
light
at
night
and
shade
at
noon
lulls
us
to
rest
with
songs
and
turns
away
all
shafts
of
shelterless
tumultuous
day
like
the
moon
growth
his
face
gleams
through
his
tune
and
as
soft
waters
warble
to
the
moon
our
answering
spirits
chime
one
roundelay
love
baubles
i
stood
where
love
in
brimming
armfuls
bore
slight
wanton
flowers
and
foolish
toys
of
fruit
and
round
him
ladies
thronged
in
warm
pursuit
fingered
and
lipped
and
proffered
the
strange
store
and
from
one
hand
the
petal
and
the
core
savoured
of
sleep
and
cluster
and
curled
shoot
seemed
from
another
hand
like
shame
salute
gifts
that
i
felt
my
cheek
was
blushing
for
at
last
love
bade
my
lady
give
the
same
and
as
i
looked
the
dew
was
light
thereon
and
as
i
took
them
at
her
touch
they
shone
with
inmost
of
the
heart
of
flame
and
then
love
said
when
the
hand
is
hers
follies
of
love
are
love
true
ministers
pride
of
youth
even
as
a
child
of
sorrow
that
we
give
the
dead
but
little
in
his
heart
can
find
since
without
need
of
thought
to
his
clear
mind
their
turn
it
is
to
die
and
his
to
live
even
so
the
winged
new
love
smiles
to
receive
along
his
eddying
plumes
the
auroral
wind
nor
forward
glorying
casts
one
look
behind
where
shrouds
the
old
love
fugitive
there
is
a
change
in
every
hour
recall
and
the
last
cowslip
in
the
fields
we
see
on
the
same
day
with
the
first
alas
for
hourly
change
alas
for
all
the
loves
that
from
his
hand
proud
youth
lets
fall
even
as
the
beads
of
a
told
rosary
winged
hours
each
hour
until
we
meet
is
as
a
bird
that
wings
from
far
his
gradual
way
along
the
rustling
covert
of
my
soul
his
song
still
loudlier
trilled
through
leaves
more
deeply
stirr
but
at
the
hour
of
meeting
a
clear
word
is
every
note
he
sings
in
love
own
tongue
yet
love
thou
the
sweet
strain
wrong
through
our
contending
kisses
oft
unheard
what
of
that
hour
at
last
when
for
her
sake
no
wing
may
fly
to
me
nor
song
may
flow
when
wandering
round
my
life
unleaved
i
the
bloodied
feathers
scattered
in
the
brake
and
think
how
she
far
from
me
with
like
eyes
sees
through
the
untuneful
bough
the
wingless
skies
thou
lovely
and
beloved
thou
my
love
whose
kiss
seems
still
the
first
whose
summoning
eyes
even
now
as
for
our
new
sunrise
shed
very
dawn
whose
voice
attuned
above
all
modulation
of
the
dove
is
like
a
hand
laid
softly
on
the
soul
whose
hand
is
like
a
sweet
voice
to
control
those
worn
tired
brows
it
hath
the
keeping
of
what
word
can
answer
to
thy
word
what
gaze
to
thine
which
now
absorbs
within
its
sphere
my
worshipping
face
till
i
am
mirrored
there
in
a
heaven
of
rays
what
clasp
what
kiss
mine
inmost
heart
can
prove
o
lovely
and
beloved
o
my
love
heart
compass
sometimes
thou
not
as
thyself
alone
but
as
the
meaning
of
all
things
that
are
a
breathless
wonder
shadowing
forth
afar
some
heavenly
solstice
hushed
and
halcyon
whose
unstirred
lips
are
music
visible
tone
whose
eyes
the
of
the
soul
unbar
being
of
its
furthest
fires
oracular
the
evident
heart
of
all
life
sown
and
mown
even
such
love
is
and
is
not
thy
name
love
yea
by
thy
hand
the
rends
apart
all
gathering
clouds
of
night
ambiguous
art
flings
them
far
down
and
sets
thine
eyes
above
and
simply
as
some
gage
of
flower
or
glove
stakes
with
a
smile
the
world
against
thy
heart
what
other
woman
could
be
loved
like
you
or
how
of
you
should
love
possess
his
fill
after
the
fulness
of
all
rapture
still
as
at
the
end
of
some
deep
avenue
a
tender
glamour
of
day
there
comes
to
view
far
in
your
eyes
a
yet
more
hungering
thrill
such
fire
as
love
hands
distil
even
from
his
inmost
arc
of
light
and
dew
and
as
the
traveller
triumphs
with
the
sun
glorying
in
heat
yet
startide
brings
wonder
and
still
fresh
transport
springs
from
limpid
lambent
hours
of
day
begun
even
so
through
eyes
and
voice
your
soul
doth
move
my
soul
with
changeful
light
of
infinite
love
the
moonstar
lady
i
thank
thee
for
thy
loveliness
because
my
lady
is
more
lovely
still
glorying
i
gaze
and
yield
with
glad
goodwill
to
thee
thy
tribute
by
whose
dress
of
delicate
life
love
labours
to
assess
my
lady
absolute
queendom
saying
how
high
this
beauty
is
which
yet
doth
show
but
as
that
beauty
sovereign
votaress
lady
i
saw
thee
with
her
side
by
side
and
as
when
night
fair
fires
their
queen
surround
an
emulous
star
too
near
the
moon
will
ride
even
so
thy
rays
within
her
luminous
bound
were
traced
no
more
and
by
the
light
so
drown
lady
not
thou
but
she
was
glorified
last
fire
love
through
your
spirit
and
mine
what
summer
eve
now
glows
with
glory
of
all
things
possess
since
this
day
sun
of
rapture
filled
the
west
and
the
light
sweetened
as
the
fire
took
leave
awhile
now
softlier
let
your
bosom
heave
as
in
love
harbour
even
that
loving
breast
all
care
takes
refuge
while
we
sink
to
rest
and
mutual
dreams
the
bygone
bliss
retrieve
many
the
days
that
winter
keeps
in
store
sunless
throughout
or
whose
brief
scarce
shed
the
heaped
snow
through
the
naked
trees
this
day
at
least
was
summer
paramour
to
the
imperishable
core
with
sweet
of
love
and
full
heart
ease
her
gifts
high
grace
the
dower
of
queens
and
therewithal
some
wonder
sweet
simplicity
a
glance
like
water
brimming
with
the
sky
or
where
fall
such
thrilling
pallor
of
cheek
as
doth
enthral
the
heart
a
mouth
whose
passionate
forms
imply
all
music
and
all
silence
held
thereby
deep
golden
locks
her
sovereign
coronal
a
round
reared
neck
meet
column
of
love
shrine
to
cling
to
when
the
heart
takes
sanctuary
hands
which
for
ever
at
love
bidding
be
and
feet
still
answering
to
his
sign
these
are
her
gifts
as
tongue
may
tell
them
breathe
low
her
name
my
soul
for
that
means
more
equal
troth
not
by
one
measure
mayst
thou
mete
our
love
for
how
should
i
be
loved
as
i
love
thee
i
graceless
joyless
lacking
absolutely
all
gifts
that
with
thy
queenship
best
behove
thou
throned
in
every
heart
elect
alcove
and
crowned
with
garlands
culled
from
every
tree
which
for
no
head
but
thine
by
love
decree
all
beauties
and
all
mysteries
interwove
but
here
thine
eyes
and
lips
yield
soft
rebuke
only
thou
i
love
thee
less
when
thou
couldst
doubt
my
love
equality
peace
sweet
if
not
to
sum
but
worth
we
look
thy
heart
transcendence
not
my
heart
excess
then
more
a
thousandfold
thou
than
venus
victrix
could
juno
self
more
sovereign
presence
wear
than
thou
other
ladies
throned
in
grace
or
pallas
when
thou
with
face
poet
page
in
thy
hair
dost
thou
than
venus
seem
less
heavenly
fair
when
the
sea
of
love
tumultuous
trance
hovers
thy
smile
and
mingles
with
thy
glance
that
sweet
voice
like
the
last
wave
murmuring
there
before
such
triune
loveliness
divine
awestruck
i
ask
which
goddess
here
most
claims
the
prize
that
adjudged
is
thine
then
love
breathes
low
the
sweetest
of
thy
names
and
venus
victrix
to
my
heart
doth
bring
herself
the
helen
of
her
guerdoning
the
dark
glass
not
i
myself
know
all
my
love
for
thee
how
should
i
reach
so
far
who
can
not
weigh
dower
by
gage
of
yesterday
shall
birth
and
death
and
all
dark
names
that
be
as
doors
and
windows
bared
to
some
loud
sea
lash
deaf
mine
ears
and
blind
my
face
with
spray
and
shall
my
sense
pierce
love
the
last
relay
and
ultimate
outpost
of
eternity
lo
what
am
i
to
love
the
lord
of
all
one
murmuring
shell
he
gathers
from
the
sand
one
little
sheltered
in
his
hand
yet
through
thine
eyes
he
grants
me
clearest
call
and
veriest
touch
of
powers
primordial
that
any
life
may
understand
the
lamp
shrine
sometimes
i
fain
would
find
in
thee
some
fault
that
i
might
love
thee
still
in
spite
of
it
yet
how
should
our
lord
love
curtail
one
whit
thy
perfect
praise
whom
most
he
would
exalt
alas
he
can
but
make
my
heart
low
vault
even
in
men
sight
unworthier
being
lit
by
thee
who
thereby
more
exquisite
like
fiery
chrysoprase
in
deep
basalt
yet
will
i
nowise
shrink
but
at
love
shrine
myself
within
the
beams
his
brow
doth
dart
will
set
the
flashing
jewel
of
thy
heart
in
that
dull
chamber
where
it
deigns
to
shine
for
lo
in
honour
of
thine
excellencies
my
heart
takes
pride
to
show
how
poor
it
is
not
in
thy
body
is
thy
life
at
all
but
in
this
lady
lips
and
hands
and
eyes
through
these
she
yields
the
life
that
vivifies
what
else
were
sorrow
servant
and
death
thrall
look
on
thyself
without
her
and
recall
the
waste
remembrance
and
forlorn
surmise
that
lived
but
in
a
breath
of
sighs
vanished
hours
and
hours
eventual
even
so
much
life
hath
the
poor
tress
of
hair
which
stored
apart
is
all
love
hath
to
show
for
and
for
long
ago
even
so
much
life
endures
unknown
even
where
change
the
changeless
night
environeth
lies
all
that
golden
hair
undimmed
in
death
the
that
dead
face
bowered
in
the
furthest
years
which
once
was
all
the
life
years
held
for
thee
can
now
scarce
bide
the
tides
of
memory
cast
on
thy
soul
a
little
spray
of
tears
how
canst
thou
gaze
into
these
eyes
of
hers
whom
now
thy
heart
delights
in
and
not
see
within
each
orb
love
philtred
euphrasy
make
them
of
buried
troth
remembrancers
pitiful
love
nay
loving
pity
well
thou
knowest
that
in
these
twain
i
have
two
very
voices
of
thy
summoning
bell
nay
master
shall
not
death
make
manifest
in
these
the
culminant
changes
which
approve
the
that
must
light
my
soul
to
love
the
morrow
message
ghost
i
said
is
thy
name
yesterday
son
with
such
an
abject
brow
and
can
be
more
pale
than
thou
while
yet
i
spoke
the
silence
answered
henceforth
our
issue
is
all
grieved
and
grey
and
each
beforehand
makes
such
poor
avow
as
of
old
leaves
beneath
the
budding
bough
or
that
the
sundawn
shreds
away
then
cried
i
of
many
malisons
o
earth
receive
me
to
thy
dusty
bed
but
therewithal
the
tremulous
silence
said
love
yet
bids
thy
lady
greet
thee
once
yea
twice
whereby
thy
life
is
still
the
sun
and
thrice
whereby
the
shadow
of
death
is
dead
sleepless
dreams
girt
in
dark
growths
yet
glimmering
with
one
star
o
night
desirous
as
the
nights
of
youth
why
should
my
heart
within
thy
spell
forsooth
now
beat
as
the
bride
are
quickened
within
the
girdling
golden
bar
what
wings
are
these
that
fan
my
pillow
smooth
and
why
does
sleep
waved
back
by
joy
and
ruth
tread
softly
round
and
gaze
at
me
from
far
nay
night
and
would
love
feign
in
thee
some
shadowy
palpitating
grove
that
bears
rest
for
man
eyes
and
music
for
his
ears
o
lonely
night
art
thou
not
known
to
me
a
thicket
hung
with
masks
of
mockery
and
watered
with
the
wasteful
warmth
of
tears
severed
selves
two
separate
divided
silences
which
brought
together
would
find
loving
voice
two
glances
which
together
would
rejoice
in
love
now
lost
like
stars
beyond
dark
trees
two
hands
apart
whose
touch
alone
gives
ease
two
bosoms
which
with
mutual
flame
would
meeting
in
one
clasp
be
made
the
same
two
souls
the
shores
of
sundering
seas
such
are
we
now
ah
may
our
hope
forecast
indeed
one
hour
again
when
on
this
stream
of
darkened
love
once
more
the
light
shall
gleam
an
hour
how
slow
to
come
how
quickly
past
which
blooms
and
fades
and
only
leaves
at
last
faint
as
shed
flowers
the
attenuated
dream
through
death
to
love
like
moonclouds
faint
to
flee
from
winds
that
sweep
the
wold
like
multiform
circumfluence
manifold
of
night
like
terrors
that
agree
of
fire
and
inarticulate
sea
even
such
within
some
glass
dimmed
by
our
breath
our
hearts
discern
wild
images
of
death
shadows
and
shoals
that
edge
eternity
howbeit
athwart
death
imminent
shade
doth
soar
one
power
than
flow
of
stream
or
flight
of
dove
sweeter
to
glide
around
to
brood
above
tell
me
my
heart
what
door
or
threshold
of
hath
guest
as
thine
whose
lord
is
love
hope
overtaken
i
deemed
thy
garments
o
my
hope
were
grey
so
far
i
viewed
thee
now
the
space
between
is
passed
at
length
and
garmented
in
green
even
as
in
days
of
yore
thou
ah
god
and
but
for
lingering
dull
dismay
on
all
that
road
our
footsteps
erst
had
been
even
thus
commingled
and
our
shadows
seen
blent
on
the
hedgerows
and
the
o
hope
of
mine
whose
eyes
are
living
love
no
eyes
but
hers
o
love
and
hope
the
same
lean
close
to
me
for
now
the
sinking
sun
that
warmed
our
feet
scarce
gilds
our
hair
above
o
hers
thy
voice
and
very
hers
thy
name
alas
cling
round
me
for
the
day
is
done
love
and
hope
bless
love
and
hope
full
many
a
withered
year
whirled
past
us
eddying
to
its
chill
doomsday
and
clasped
together
where
the
blown
leaves
lay
we
long
have
knelt
and
wept
full
many
a
tear
yet
lo
one
hour
at
last
the
spring
compeer
flutes
softly
to
us
from
some
green
byeway
those
years
those
tears
are
dead
but
only
they
bless
love
and
hope
true
soul
for
we
are
here
cling
heart
to
heart
nor
of
this
hour
demand
whether
in
very
truth
when
we
are
dead
our
hearts
shall
wake
to
know
love
golden
head
sole
sunshine
of
the
imperishable
land
or
but
discern
through
night
unfeatured
scope
at
length
the
illusive
eyes
of
hope
sic
cloud
and
wind
love
should
i
fear
death
most
for
you
or
me
yet
if
you
die
can
i
not
follow
you
forcing
the
straits
of
change
alas
but
who
shall
wrest
a
bond
from
night
inveteracy
ere
yet
my
hazardous
soul
put
forth
to
be
her
warrant
against
all
her
haste
might
rue
ah
in
your
eyes
so
reached
what
dumb
adieu
what
unsunned
gyres
of
waste
eternity
and
if
i
die
the
first
shall
death
be
then
a
lampless
watchtower
whence
i
see
you
weep
or
woe
is
me
a
bed
wherein
my
sleep
notes
as
death
dear
cup
at
last
you
drain
the
hour
when
you
too
learn
that
all
is
vain
and
that
hope
sows
what
love
shall
never
reap
secret
parting
because
our
talk
was
of
the
and
of
the
journeying
face
of
fate
her
tremulous
kisses
faltered
at
love
gate
and
her
eyes
dreamed
against
a
distant
goal
but
soon
remembering
her
how
brief
the
whole
of
joy
which
its
own
hours
annihilate
her
set
gaze
gathered
thirstier
than
of
late
and
as
she
kissed
her
mouth
became
her
soul
thence
in
what
ways
we
wandered
and
how
strove
to
build
with
vows
the
piteous
home
which
memory
haunts
and
whither
sleep
may
roam
they
only
know
for
whom
the
roof
of
love
is
the
secret
of
the
grove
nor
spire
may
rise
nor
bell
be
heard
therefrom
parted
love
what
shall
be
said
of
this
embattled
day
and
armed
occupation
of
this
night
by
all
thy
foes
beleaguered
now
when
sight
nor
sound
denotes
the
loved
one
far
away
of
these
thy
vanquished
hours
what
shalt
thou
say
as
every
sense
to
which
she
dealt
delight
now
labours
lonely
the
stark
to
reach
the
sunset
desolate
disarray
stand
still
fond
fettered
wretch
while
memory
art
parades
the
past
before
thy
face
and
lures
thy
spirit
to
her
passionate
portraitures
till
the
tempestuous
flung
apart
flood
with
wild
will
the
hollows
of
thy
heart
and
thy
heart
rends
thee
and
thy
body
endures
broken
music
the
mother
will
not
turn
who
thinks
she
hears
her
nursling
speech
first
grow
articulate
but
breathless
with
averted
eyes
elate
she
sits
with
open
lips
and
open
ears
that
it
may
call
her
twice
doubts
and
fears
thus
oft
my
soul
has
hearkened
till
the
song
a
central
moan
for
days
at
length
found
tongue
and
the
sweet
music
welled
and
the
sweet
tears
but
now
whatever
while
the
soul
is
fain
to
list
that
wonted
murmur
as
it
were
the
low
importunate
strain
no
breath
of
song
thy
voice
alone
is
there
o
bitterly
beloved
and
all
her
gain
is
but
the
pang
of
unpermitted
prayer
there
came
an
image
in
life
retinue
that
had
love
wings
and
bore
his
gonfalon
fair
was
the
web
and
nobly
wrought
thereon
o
face
thy
form
and
hue
bewildering
sounds
such
as
spring
wakens
to
shook
in
its
folds
and
through
my
heart
its
power
sped
trackless
as
the
immemorable
hour
when
birth
dark
portal
groaned
and
all
was
new
but
a
veiled
woman
followed
and
she
caught
the
banner
round
its
staff
to
furl
and
cling
then
plucked
a
feather
from
the
bearer
wing
and
held
it
to
his
lips
that
stirred
it
not
and
said
to
me
there
is
no
breath
i
and
this
love
are
one
and
i
am
death
willowwood
i
i
sat
with
love
upon
a
woodside
well
leaning
across
the
water
i
and
he
nor
ever
did
he
speak
nor
looked
at
me
but
touched
his
lute
wherein
was
audible
the
certain
secret
thing
he
had
to
tell
only
our
mirrored
eyes
met
silently
in
the
low
wave
and
that
sound
came
to
be
the
passionate
voice
i
knew
and
my
tears
fell
and
at
their
fall
his
eyes
beneath
grew
hers
and
with
his
foot
and
with
his
he
swept
the
spring
that
watered
my
heart
drouth
then
the
dark
ripples
spread
to
waving
hair
and
as
i
stooped
her
own
lips
rising
there
bubbled
with
brimming
kisses
at
my
mouth
ii
and
now
love
sang
but
his
was
such
a
song
so
meshed
with
hard
to
free
as
souls
disused
in
death
sterility
may
sing
when
the
new
birthday
tarries
long
and
i
was
made
aware
of
a
dumb
throng
that
stood
aloof
one
form
by
every
tree
all
mournful
forms
for
each
was
i
or
she
the
shades
of
those
our
days
that
had
no
tongue
they
looked
on
us
and
knew
us
and
were
known
while
fast
together
alive
from
the
abyss
clung
the
implacable
close
kiss
and
pity
of
self
through
all
made
broken
moan
which
said
once
for
once
for
once
alone
and
still
love
sang
and
what
he
sang
was
this
iii
ye
all
ye
that
walk
in
that
walk
with
hollow
faces
burning
white
what
of
widowhood
what
long
what
longer
hours
one
lifelong
night
ere
ye
again
who
so
in
vain
have
wooed
your
last
hope
lost
who
so
in
vain
invite
your
lips
to
that
their
unforgotten
food
ere
ye
ere
ye
again
shall
see
the
light
alas
the
bitter
banks
in
willowwood
with
wan
with
burning
red
alas
if
ever
such
a
pillow
could
steep
deep
the
soul
in
sleep
till
she
were
dead
better
all
life
forget
her
than
this
thing
that
willowwood
should
hold
her
wandering
iv
so
sang
he
and
as
meeting
rose
and
rose
together
cling
through
the
wind
wellaway
nor
change
at
once
yet
near
the
end
of
day
the
leaves
drop
loosened
where
the
glows
so
when
the
song
died
did
the
kiss
unclose
and
her
face
fell
back
drowned
and
was
as
grey
as
its
grey
eyes
and
if
it
ever
may
meet
mine
again
i
know
not
if
love
knows
only
i
know
that
i
leaned
low
and
drank
a
long
draught
from
the
water
where
she
sank
her
breath
and
all
her
tears
and
all
her
soul
and
as
i
leaned
i
know
i
felt
love
face
pressed
on
my
neck
with
moan
of
pity
and
grace
till
both
our
heads
were
in
his
aureole
without
her
what
of
her
glass
without
her
the
blank
grey
there
where
the
pool
is
blind
of
the
moon
face
her
dress
without
her
the
tossed
empty
space
of
whence
the
moon
has
passed
away
her
paths
without
her
day
appointed
sway
usurped
by
desolate
night
her
pillowed
place
without
her
tears
ah
me
for
love
good
grace
and
cold
forgetfulness
of
night
or
day
what
of
the
heart
without
her
nay
poor
heart
of
thee
what
word
remains
ere
speech
be
still
a
wayfarer
by
barren
ways
and
chill
steep
ways
and
weary
without
her
thou
art
where
the
long
cloud
the
long
wood
counterpart
sheds
doubled
darkness
up
the
labouring
hill
love
fatality
sweet
love
but
oh
most
dread
desire
of
love
linked
in
gyves
i
saw
them
stand
love
shackled
with
hand
to
hand
and
one
was
eyed
as
the
blue
vault
above
but
hope
tempestuous
like
a
hove
i
the
other
gaze
even
as
in
his
whose
wand
vainly
all
night
with
power
has
the
unyielding
caves
of
some
deep
also
his
lips
two
writhen
flakes
of
flame
made
moan
o
love
thus
leashed
with
me
thou
once
born
free
and
i
thy
cowering
self
in
chains
grown
tame
bound
to
thy
body
and
soul
named
with
thy
name
life
iron
heart
even
love
fatality
stillborn
love
the
hour
which
might
have
been
yet
might
not
be
which
man
and
woman
heart
conceived
and
bore
yet
whereof
life
was
barren
on
what
shore
bides
it
the
breaking
of
time
weary
sea
bondchild
of
all
consummate
joys
set
free
it
somewhere
sighs
and
serves
and
mute
before
the
house
of
love
hears
through
the
echoing
door
his
hours
elect
in
choral
consonancy
but
lo
what
wedded
souls
now
hand
in
hand
together
tread
at
last
the
immortal
strand
with
eyes
where
burning

lights

how
the

has
turned

the

wing
with
fires
of
sunrise
and
of
sunsetting
the
furtive
flickering
streams
to
light
airs
and
valorous
lusts
of
morn
while
all
the
daughters
of
the
daybreak
sing
these

loves
and

and
when
flown
all
joys
and
through
dark
in
flight
the
wind
swoops
onward
brandishing
the
light
even
yet
the
verdure
left
alone
will
flush
all
ruddy
though
the
rose
be
gone
with
ditties
and
with
dirges
infinite
known
in
vain
as
two
whose
love
first
foolish
widening
scope
knows
suddenly
with
music
high
and
soft
the
holy
of
holies
who
because
they
are
now
amazed
with
shame
nor
dare
to
cope
with
the
whole
truth
aloud
lest
heaven
should
ope
yet
at
their
meetings
laugh
not
as
they
in
speech
nor
speak
at
length
but
sitting
oft
together
within
hopeless
sight
of
hope
for
hours
are
silent
so
it
happeneth
when
work
and
will
awake
too
late
to
gaze
after
their
life
sailed
by
and
hold
their
breath
ah
who
shall
dare
to
search
through
what
sad
maze
thenceforth
their
incommunicable
ways
follow
the
desultory
feet
of
death
heart
of
the
night
from
child
to
youth
from
youth
to
arduous
man
from
lethargy
to
fever
of
the
heart
from
faithful
life
to
days
apart
from
trust
to
doubt
from
doubt
to
brink
of
ban
thus
much
of
change
in
one
swift
cycle
ran
till
now
alas
the
soul
how
soon
must
she
accept
her
primal
immortality
the
flesh
resume
its
dust
whence
it
began
o
lord
of
work
and
peace
o
lord
of
life
o
lord
the
awful
lord
of
will
though
late
even
yet
renew
this
soul
with
duteous
breath
that
when
the
peace
is
garnered
in
from
strife
the
work
retrieved
the
will
regenerate
this
soul
may
see
thy
face
o
lord
of
death
the
landmark
was
the
landmark
what
the
foolish
well
whose
wave
low
down
i
did
not
stoop
to
drink
but
sat
and
flung
the
pebbles
from
its
brink
in
sport
to
send
its
imaged
skies
and
mine
own
image
had
i
noted
well
was
that
my
point
of
turning
i
had
thought
the
stations
of
my
course
should
rise
unsought
as
or
ensigned
citadel
but
lo
the
path
is
missed
i
must
go
back
and
thirst
to
drink
when
next
i
reach
the
spring
which
once
i
stained
which
since
may
have
grown
black
yet
though
no
light
be
left
nor
bird
now
sing
as
here
i
turn
i
thank
god
hastening
that
the
same
goal
is
still
on
the
same
track
a
dark
day
the
gloom
that
breathes
upon
me
with
these
airs
is
like
the
drops
which
strike
the
traveller
brow
who
knows
not
darkling
if
they
bring
him
now
fresh
storm
or
be
old
rain
the
covert
bears
ah
bodes
this
hour
some
harvest
of
new
tares
or
hath
but
memory
of
the
day
whose
plough
sowed
hunger
once
the
night
at
length
when
thou
o
prayer
found
vain
didst
fall
from
out
my
prayers
how
prickly
were
the
growths
which
yet
how
smooth
along
the
hedgerows
of
this
journey
shed
lie
by
time
grace
till
night
and
sleep
may
soothe
even
as
the
thistledown
from
pathsides
dead
gleaned
by
a
girl
in
autumns
of
her
youth
which
one
new
year
makes
soft
her
autumn
idleness
this
sunlight
shames
november
where
he
grieves
in
dead
red
leaves
and
will
not
let
him
shun
the
day
though
bough
with
bough
be
but
with
a
blessing
every
glade
receives
high
salutation
while
from
the
deer
gaze
calling
dappled
white
and
dun
as
if
being
foresters
of
old
the
sun
had
marked
them
with
the
shade
of
here
dawn
unveiled
her
magic
glass
here
noon
now
gives
the
thirst
and
takes
the
dew
till
eve
bring
rest
when
other
good
things
pass
and
here
the
lost
hours
the
lost
hours
renew
while
i
still
lead
my
shadow
the
grass
nor
know
for
longing
that
which
i
should
do
the
hill
summit
this
of
the
sun
his
altar
there
in
the
broad
west
has
blazed
for
and
i
have
loitered
in
the
vale
too
long
and
gaze
now
a
belated
worshipper
yet
may
i
not
forget
that
i
was
so
journeying
of
his
face
at
intervals
transfigured
where
the
fringed
horizon
falls
a
fiery
bush
with
coruscating
hair
and
now
that
i
have
climbed
and
won
this
height
i
must
tread
downward
through
the
sloping
shade
and
travel
the
bewildered
tracks
till
night
yet
for
this
hour
i
still
may
here
be
stayed
and
see
the
gold
air
and
the
silver
fade
and
the
last
bird
fly
into
the
last
light
the
choice
i

thou

surely
the

our

then
loose
me
love

hold
thy

up

i
may
pour
for
thee
this

round
the

thy

we
drown
all

thy

while
hours
toil
shall
leap
as
fountains
veil
the

that
there
are

those
my

who
increase
vain

vain

beyond
those

there
is
more
sea
sic
old
and
new
art
luke
the
painter
give
honour
unto
luke
evangelist
for
he
it
was
the
aged
legends
say
who
first
taught
art
to
fold
her
hands
and
pray
scarcely
at
once
she
dared
to
rend
the
mist
of
devious
symbols
but
soon
having
wist
how
and
and
this
day
are
symbols
also
in
some
deeper
way
she
looked
through
these
to
god
and
was
god
priest
and
if
past
noon
her
toil
began
to
irk
and
she
sought
talismans
and
turned
in
vain
to
soulless
of
man
skill
yet
now
in
this
the
twilight
she
might
still
kneel
in
the
latter
grass
to
pray
again
ere
the
night
cometh
and
she
may
not
work
ii
not
as
these
am
not
as
these
are
the
poet
saith
in
youth
pride
and
the
painter
among
men
at
bay
where
never
pencil
comes
nor
pen
and
shut
about
with
his
own
frozen
breath
to
others
for
whom
only
rhyme
wins
faith
as
poets
only
paint
as
painters
then
he
turns
in
the
cold
silence
and
again
shrinking
am
not
as
these
are
he
saith
and
say
that
this
is
so
what
follows
it
for
were
thine
eyes
set
backwards
in
thine
head
such
words
were
well
but
they
see
on
and
far
unto
the
lights
of
the
great
past
fair
for
the
future
track
look
thou
instead
say
thou
instead
am
not
as
are
iii
the
husbandmen
though
god
as
one
that
is
an
householder
called
these
to
labour
in
his
first
before
the
husk
of
darkness
was
well
burst
bidding
them
grope
their
way
out
and
bestir
who
questioned
of
their
wages
answered
unto
each
man
a
penny
though
the
worst
burthen
of
heat
was
theirs
and
the
dry
thirst
though
god
hath
since
found
none
such
as
these
were
to
do
their
work
like
them
because
of
this

not
ye

which

after

appointed

shall
give
a

to
their
past
soul
beauty
under
the
arch
of
life
where
love
and
death
terror
and
mystery
guard
her
shrine
i
saw
beauty
enthroned
and
though
her
gaze
struck
awe
i
drew
it
in
as
simply
as
my
breath
hers
are
the
eyes
which
over
and
beneath
the
sky
and
sea
bend
on
thee
which
can
draw
by
sea
or
sky
or

to
one
law
the
allotted
bondman
of
her
palm
and
wreath
this
is
that
lady
beauty
in
whose
praise
thy
voice
and
hand
shake
still
long
known
to
thee
by
flying
hair
and
fluttering
hem
the
beat
following
her
daily
of
thy
heart
and
feet
how
passionately
and
irretrievably
in
what
fond
flight
how
many
ways
and
days
body
beauty
of
adam
first
wife
lilith
it
is
told
the
witch
he
loved
before
the
gift
of
eve
that
ere
the
snake
her
sweet
tongue
could
deceive
and
her
enchanted
hair
was
the
first
gold
and
still
she
sits
young
while
the
earth
is
old
and
subtly
of
herself
contemplative
draws
men
to
watch
the
bright
web
she
can
weave
till
heart
and
body
and
life
are
in
its
hold
the
rose
and
poppy
are
her
flowers
for
where
is
he
not
found
o
lilith
whom
shed
scent
and
kisses
and
soft
sleep
shall
snare
lo
as
that
youth
eyes
burned
at
thine
so
went
thy
spell
through
him
and
left
his
straight
neck
bent
and
round
his
heart
one
strangling
golden
hair
the
monochord
is
it
this
sky
vast
vault
or
ocean
sound
that
is
life
self
and
draws
my
life
from
me
and
by
instinct
ineffable
decree
holds
my
breath
quailing
on
the
bitter
bound
nay
is
it
life
or
death
thus
that
the
tide
of
all
emergency
now
notes
my
separate
wave
and
to
what
sea
its
difficult
eddies
labour
in
the
ground
oh
what
is
this
that
knows
the
road
i
came
the
flame
turned
cloud
the
cloud
returned
to
flame
the
lifted
shifted
steeps
and
all
the
way
that
draws
round
me
at
last
this
space
and
in
regenerate
rapture
turns
my
face
upon
the
devious
coverts
of
dismay
from
dawn
to
noon
as
the
child
knows
not
if
his
mother
face
be
fair
nor
of
his
elders
yet
can
deem
what
each
most
is
but
as
of
hill
or
stream
at
dawn
all
glimmering
life
surrounds
his
place
who
yet
noon
of
his
race
pausing
awhile
beneath
the
high
and
gazing
steadily
back
as
through
a
dream
in
things
long
past
new
features
now
can
trace
even
so
the
thought
that
is
at
length
fullgrown
turns
back
to
note
the
paths
all
grey
and
marvellous
once
where
first
it
walked
alone
and
haply
doubts
amid
the
unblenching
day
which
most
or
least
impelled
its
onward
way
those
unknown
things
or
these
things
overknown
memorial
thresholds
what
place
so
strange
though
unrevealed
snow
with
unimaginable
fires
arise
at
the
earth
end
what
passion
of
surprise
like
scenes
of
long
ago
lo
this
is
none
but
i
this
hour
and
lo
this
is
the
very
place
which
to
mine
eyes
those
mortal
hours
in
vain
immortalize
hurrying
crowds
with
what
alone
i
know
city
of
thine
a
single
simple
door
by
some
new
power
reduplicate
must
be
even
yet
my
in
eternity
even
with
one
presence
filled
as
once
of
yore
or
mocking
winds
whirl
round
a
floor
thee
and
thy
years
and
these
my
words
and
me
hoarded
joy
i
said
pluck
not
let
the
first
fruit
be
even
as
thou
sayest
it
is
sweet
and
red
but
let
it
ripen
still
the
tree
bent
head
sees
in
the
stream
its
own
fecundity
and
bides
the
day
of
fulness
shall
not
we
at
the
sun
hour
that
day
possess
the
shade
and
claim
our
fruit
before
its
ripeness
fade
and
eat
it
from
the
branch
and
praise
the
tree
i
say
our
fruit
hath
wooed
the
sun
too
long
is
fallen
and
floats
adown
the
stream
lo
the
last
clusters
pluck
them
every
one
and
let
us
sup
with
summer
ere
the
gleam
of
autumn
set
the
year
pent
sorrow
free
and
the
woods
wail
like
echoes
from
the
sea
barren
spring
so
now
the
changed
year
turning
wheel
returns
and
as
a
girl
sails
balanced
in
the
wind
and
now
before
and
now
again
behind
stoops
as
it
swoops
with
cheek
that
laughs
and
burns
so
spring
comes
merry
towards
me
now
but
earns
no
answering
smile
from
me
whose
life
is
with
the
dead
boughs
that
winter
still
must
bind
and
whom
the
spring
no
more
concerns
behold
this
crocus
is
a
withering
flame
this
snowdrop
snow
this
part
to
breed
the
fruit
that
breeds
the
serpent
art
nay
for
these
turn
thy
face
from
them
nor
gaze
till
on
the
year
last
the
white
cup
shrivels
round
the
golden
heart
farewell
to
the
glen
sweet
glen
why
say
to
thee
who
so
well
and
for
ever
smooth
the
brow
of
time
where
man
may
read
no
ruth
nay
do
thou
rather
say
to
me
who
now
fare
forth
in
bitterer
fantasy
than
erst
was
mine
where
other
shade
might
soothe
by
other
streams
what
while
in
fragrant
youth
the
bliss
of
being
sad
made
melancholy
and
yet
farewell
for
better
shalt
thou
fare
when
children
bathe
sweet
faces
in
thy
flow
and
happy
lovers
blend
sweet
shadows
there
in
hours
to
come
than
when
an
hour
ago
thine
echoes
had
but
one
man
sighs
to
bear
and
thy
trees
whispered
what
he
feared
to
know
vain
virtues
what
is
the
sorriest
thing
that
enters
hell
none
of
the
sins
but
this
and
that
fair
deed
which
a
soul
sin
at
length
could
supersede
these
yet
are
virgins
whom
death
timely
knell
might
once
have
sainted
whom
the
fiends
compel
together
now
in
shuddering
sheaves
of
anguish
while
the
scorching
bridegroom
leaves
their
refuse
maidenhood
abominable
night
sucks
them
down
the
garbage
of
the
pit
whose
names
half
entered
in
the
book
of
life
were
god
desire
at
noon
and
as
their
hair
and
eyes
sink
last
the
torturer
deigns
no
whit
to
gaze
but
yearning
waits
his
worthier
wife
the
sin
still
blithe
on
earth
that
sent
them
there
lost
days
the
lost
days
of
my
life
until
what
were
they
could
i
see
them
on
the
street
lie
as
they
fell
would
they
be
ears
of
wheat
sown
once
for
food
but
trodden
into
clay
or
golden
coins
squandered
and
still
to
pay
or
drops
of
blood
dabbling
the
guilty
feet
or
such
spilt
water
as
in
dreams
must
cheat
the
throats
of
men
in
hell
who
thirst
alway
i
do
not
see
them
here
but
after
death
god
knows
i
know
the
faces
i
shall
see
each
one
a
murdered
self
with
low
last
breath
am
thyself
what
hast
thou
done
to
me
i
and
i
thyself
lo
each
one
saith
thou
thyself
to
all
eternity
death
songsters
when
first
that
horse
within
whose
populous
womb
the
birth
was
death
troy
with
fate
her
elders
dubious
of
its
grecian
freight
brought
helen
there
to
sing
the
songs
of
home
she
whispered
i
am
alone
come
come
then
crouched
within
ulysses
waxed
afraid
and
on
his
comrades
quivering
mouths
he
laid
his
hands
and
held
them
till
the
voice
was
dumb
the
same
was
he
who
lashed
to
his
own
mast
there
where
the
screen
the
beside
the
sirens
singing
island
pass
till
sweetness
failed
along
the
inveterate
waves

passed
death
haggard
hills
and
ye
whom
trees
that

shall
cease

and
still
stand
silent
is
it
all
a
show
a
wisp
that
laughs
upon
the
wall
decree
of
some
inexorable
supremacy
which
ever
as
man
strains
his

surmise
from

unabashed
augury

hillocks

stooping
against

a

from

by

hair
so
shall

be

hurled
abroad
by
reinless

satan
oft

thee
praise
leave
these
weak
feet
to
tread
in
narrow
ways
thou
still
upon
the
broad
path
mayst
wait
the
turning
of
the
phials
of
wrath
for
certain
years
for
certain
months
and
days
lost
on
both
sides
as
when
two
men
have
loved
a
woman
well
each
hating
each
through
love
and
death
deceit
since
not
for
either
this
stark
and
the
long
pauses
of
this
wedding
bell
yet
her
grave
the
night
and
day
dispel
at
last
their
feud
forlorn
with
cold
and
heat
nor
other
than
dear
friends
to
death
may
fleet
the
two
lives
left
that
most
of
her
can
tell
so
separate
hopes
which
in
a
soul
had
wooed
the
one
same
peace
strove
with
each
other
long
and
peace
before
their
faces
perished
since
so
through
that
soul
in
restless
brotherhood
they
roam
together
now
and
wind
among
its
knocking
at
the
dusty
inns
the
sun
shame
i
beholding
youth
and
hope
in
mockery
caught
from
life
and
mocking
pulses
that
remain
when
the
soul
death
of
bodily
death
is
fain
honour
unknown
and
honour
known
unsought
and
penury
sedulous
thought
on
gold
whose
master
therewith
buys
his
bane
and
woman
longing
all
in
vain
for
lonely
man
with
love
desire
distraught
and
wealth
and
strength
and
power
and
pleasantness
given
unto
bodies
of
whose
souls
men
say
none
poor
and
weak
slavish
and
foul
as
they
beholding
these
things
i
behold
no
less
the
blushing
morn
and
blushing
eve
confess
the
shame
that
loads
the
intolerable
day
as
some
true
chief
of
men
bowed
down
with
stress
of
life
disastrous
eld
on
blossoming
youth
may
gaze
and
murmur
with
and
ruth
i
thy
fruitless
treasure
but
possess
such
blessing
of
mine
all
coming
years
should
bless
then
sends
one
sigh
forth
to
the
unknown
goal
and
bitterly
feels
breathe
against
his
soul
the
hour
of
nearer
nothingness
even
so
the
world
grey
soul
to
the
green
world
perchance
one
hour
must
cry
me
for
whom
inveteracy
of
ill
portends
the
doom
whose
heart
old
fire
in
shadow
of
shame
is
furl
while
thou
even
as
of
yore
art
journeying
all
soulless
now
yet
merry
with
the
spring
michelangelo
kiss
great
michelangelo
with
age
grown
bleak
and
uttermost
labours
having
once
all
grievous
memories
on
his
long
life
shed
this
worst
regret
to
one
true
heart
could
speak
that
when
with
sorrowing
love
and
reverence
meek
he
stooped
sweet
colonna
dying
bed
his
muse
and
dominant
lady
her
hand
he
kissed
but
not
her
brow
or
cheek
o
buonarruoti
good
at
art
to
urge
her
chariot
even
thus
the
soul
touching
at
length
some
goal
earns
oftenest
but
a
little
her
appeals
were
deep
and
mute
lowly
her
claim
let
be
what
holds
for
her
death
garner
and
for
thee
the
vase
of
life
around
the
vase
of
life
at
your
slow
pace
he
has
not
crept
but
turned
it
with
his
hands
and
all
its
sides
already
understands
there
girt
one
breathes
alert
for
some
great
race
whose
road
runs
far
by
sands
and
fruitful
space
who
laughs
yet
through
the
jolly
throng
has
pass
who
weeps
nor
stays
for
weeping
who
at
last
a
youth
stands
somewhere
crowned
with
silent
face
and
he
has
filled
this
vase
with
wine
for
blood
with
blood
for
tears
with
spice
for
burning
vow
with
watered
flowers
for
buried
love
most
fit
and
would
have
cast
it
shattered
to
the
flood
yet
in
fate
name
has
kept
it
whole
which
now
stands
empty
till
his
ashes
fall
in
it
life
the
beloved
as
thy
friend
face
with
shadow
of
soul
somewhile
unto
thy
sight
perchance
hath
been
ghastly
and
strange
yet
never
so
is
seen
in
thought
but
to
all
fortunate
favour
wed
as
thy
love
features
never
dead
to
memory
glass
return
but
contravene
frail
fugitive
days
and
always
keep
i
ween
than
all
new
life
a
livelier
lovelihead
so
life
herself
thy
spirit
friend
and
love
even
still
as
spring
authentic
harbinger
glows
with
fresh
hours
for
hope
to
glorify
though
pale
she
lay
when
in
the
winter
grove
her
funeral
flowers
were
shed
on
her
and
the
red
wings
of
rent
the
sky
a
superscription
look
in
my
face
my
name
is
i
am
also
called
farewell
unto
thine
ear
i
hold
the
shell
cast
up
thy
life
feet
between
unto
thine
eyes
the
glass
where
that
is
seen
which
had
life
form
and
love
but
by
my
spell
is
now
a
shaken
shadow
intolerable
of
ultimate
things
unuttered
the
frail
screen
mark
me
how
still
i
am
but
should
there
dart
one
moment
through
thy
soul
the
soft
surprise
of
that
winged
peace
which
lulls
the
breath
of
sighs
then
shalt
thou
see
me
smile
and
turn
apart
thy
visage
to
mine
ambush
at
thy
heart
sleepless
with
cold
commemorative
eyes
he
and
i
whence
came
his
feet
into
my
field
and
why
how
is
it
that
he
sees
it
all
so
drear
how
do
i
see
his
seeing
and
how
hear
the
name
his
bitter
silence
knows
it
by
this
was
the
little
fold
of
separate
sky
whose
pasturing
clouds
in
the
soul
atmosphere
drew
living
light
from
one
continual
year
how
should
he
find
it
lifeless
he
or
i
lo
this
new
self
now
wanders
round
my
field
with
plaints
for
every
flower
and
for
each
tree
a
moan
the
sighing
wind
auxiliary
and
sweet
waters
of
my
life
that
yield
unto
his
lips
no
draught
but
tears
unseal
even
in
my
place
he
weeps
even
i
not
he
newborn
death
i
death
seems
to
me
an
infant
child
which
her
worn
mother
life
upon
my
knee
has
set
to
grow
my
friend
and
play
with
me
if
haply
so
my
heart
might
be
to
find
no
terrors
in
a
face
so
mild
if
haply
so
my
weary
heart
might
be
unto
the
newborn
milky
eyes
of
thee
o
death
before
resentment
reconcil
how
long
o
death
and
shall
thy
feet
depart
still
a
young
child
with
mine
or
wilt
thou
stand
fullgrown
the
helpful
daughter
of
my
heart
what
time
with
thee
indeed
i
reach
the
strand
of
the
pale
wave
which
knows
thee
what
thou
art
and
drink
it
in
the
hollow
of
thy
hand
ii
and
thou
o
life
the
lady
of
all
bliss
with
whom
when
our
first
heart
beat
full
and
fast
i
wandered
till
the
haunts
of
men
were
pass
and
in
fair
places
found
all
bowers
amiss
till
only
woods
and
waves
might
hear
our
kiss
while
to
the
winds
all
thought
of
death
we
cast
ah
life
and
must
i
have
from
thee
at
last
no
smile
to
greet
me
and
no
babe
but
this
lo
love
the
child
once
ours
and
song
whose
hair
blew
like
a
flame
and
blossomed
like
a
wreath
and
art
whose
eyes
were
worlds
by
god
found
fair
these
the
book
of
nature
mixed
their
breath
with
arms
as
oft
we
watched
them
there
and
did
these
die
that
thou
mightst
bear
me
death
the
one
hope
when
all
desire
at
last
and
all
regret
go
hand
in
hand
to
death
and
all
is
vain
what
shall
assuage
the
unforgotten
pain
and
teach
the
unforgetful
to
forget
shall
peace
be
still
a
sunk
stream
long
unmet
or
may
the
soul
at
once
in
a
green
plain
stoop
through
the
spray
of
some
sweet
and
cull
the
flowering
amulet
ah
when
the
wan
soul
in
that
golden
air
between
the
scriptured
petals
softly
blown
peers
breathless
for
the
gift
of
grace
unknown
ah
let
none
other
written
spell
but
only
the
one
hope
one
name
be
there
not
less
nor
more
but
even
that
word
alone
