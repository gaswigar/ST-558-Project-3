the
doctor
has
just
left
me
at
last
i
have
got
at
something
definite
for
all
his
cunning
he
had
to
speak
out
at
last
yes
i
am
soon
very
soon
to
die
the
frozen
rivers
will
break
up
and
with
the
last
snow
i
shall
most
likely
swim
away
whither
god
knows
to
the
ocean
too
well
well
since
one
must
die
one
may
as
well
die
in
the
spring
but
is
it
absurd
to
begin
a
diary
a
fortnight
perhaps
before
death
what
does
it
matter
and
by
how
much
are
fourteen
days
less
than
fourteen
years
fourteen
centuries
beside
eternity
they
say
all
is
nothingness
yes
but
in
that
case
eternity
too
is
nothing
i
see
i
am
letting
myself
drop
into
metaphysics
that
a
bad
sign
am
i
not
rather
perchance
i
had
better
begin
a
description
of
some
sort
it
damp
and
windy
out
of
doors
i
forbidden
to
go
out
what
can
i
write
about
then
no
decent
man
talks
of
his
maladies
to
write
a
novel
is
not
in
my
line
reflections
on
elevated
topics
are
beyond
me
descriptions
of
the
life
going
on
around
me
could
not
even
interest
me
while
i
am
weary
of
doing
nothing
and
too
lazy
to
read
ah
i
have
it
i
will
write
the
story
of
all
my
life
for
myself
a
idea
just
before
death
it
is
a
suitable
thing
to
do
and
can
be
of
no
harm
to
any
one
i
will
begin
i
was
born
thirty
years
ago
the
son
of
fairly
landowners
my
father
had
a
passion
for
gambling
my
mother
was
a
woman
of
character
a
very
virtuous
woman
only
i
have
known
no
woman
whose
moral
excellence
was
less
productive
of
happiness
she
was
crushed
beneath
the
weight
of
her
own
virtues
and
was
a
source
of
misery
to
every
one
from
herself
upwards
in
all
the
fifty
years
of
her
life
she
never
once
took
rest
or
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
she
was
for
ever
fussing
and
bustling
about
like
an
ant
and
to
absolutely
no
good
purpose
which
can
not
be
said
of
the
ant
the
worm
of
restlessness
fretted
her
night
and
day
only
once
i
saw
her
perfectly
tranquil
and
that
was
the
day
after
her
death
in
her
coffin
looking
at
her
it
positively
seemed
to
me
that
her
face
wore
an
expression
of
subdued
amazement
with
the
lips
the
sunken
cheeks
and
eyes
it
seemed
expressing
all
over
the
words
good
to
be
at
rest
yes
it
is
good
good
to
be
rid
at
last
of
the
wearing
sense
of
life
of
the
persistent
restless
consciousness
of
existence
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
i
was
brought
up
badly
and
not
happily
my
father
and
mother
both
loved
me
but
that
made
things
no
better
for
me
my
father
was
not
even
in
his
own
house
of
the
slightest
authority
or
consequence
being
a
man
openly
abandoned
to
a
shameful
and
ruinous
vice
he
was
conscious
of
his
degradation
and
not
having
the
strength
of
will
to
give
up
his
darling
passion
he
tried
at
least
by
his
invariably
amiable
and
humble
demeanour
and
his
unswerving
submissiveness
to
win
the
condescending
consideration
of
his
exemplary
wife
my
mother
certainly
did
bear
her
trial
with
the
superb
and
majestic
of
virtue
in
which
there
is
so
much
of
egoistic
pride
she
never
reproached
my
father
for
anything
gave
him
her
last
penny
and
paid
his
debts
without
a
word
he
exalted
her
as
a
paragon
to
her
face
and
behind
her
back
but
did
not
like
to
be
at
home
and
caressed
me
by
stealth
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
contaminating
me
by
his
presence
but
at
such
times
his
distorted
features
were
full
of
such
kindness
the
nervous
grin
on
his
lips
was
replaced
by
such
a
touching
smile
and
his
brown
eyes
encircled
by
fine
wrinkles
shone
with
such
love
that
i
could
not
help
pressing
my
cheek
to
his
which
was
wet
and
warm
with
tears
i
wiped
away
those
tears
with
my
handkerchief
and
they
flowed
again
without
effort
like
water
from
a
brimming
glass
i
fell
to
crying
too
and
he
comforted
me
stroking
my
back
and
kissing
me
all
over
my
face
with
his
quivering
lips
even
now
more
than
twenty
years
after
his
death
when
i
think
of
my
poor
father
dumb
sobs
rise
into
my
throat
and
my
heart
beats
as
hotly
and
bitterly
and
aches
with
as
poignant
a
pity
as
if
it
had
long
to
go
on
beating
as
if
there
were
anything
to
be
sorry
for
my
mother
behaviour
to
me
on
the
contrary
was
always
the
same
kind
but
cold
in
children
books
one
often
comes
across
such
mothers
sermonising
and
just
she
loved
me
but
i
did
not
love
her
yes
i
fought
shy
of
my
virtuous
mother
and
passionately
loved
my
vicious
father
but
enough
for
it
a
beginning
and
as
for
the
end
whatever
it
may
be
i
need
trouble
my
head
about
it
that
for
my
illness
to
see
to
it
is
marvellous
weather
warm
bright
the
sunshine
frolicking
gaily
on
the
melting
snow
everything
shining
steaming
dripping
the
sparrows
chattering
like
mad
things
about
the
drenched
dark
hedges
sweetly
and
terribly
too
the
moist
air
frets
my
sick
chest
spring
spring
is
coming
i
sit
at
the
window
and
look
across
the
river
into
the
open
country
o
nature
nature
i
love
thee
so
but
i
came
forth
from
thy
womb
good
for
nothing
not
fit
even
for
life
there
goes
a
hopping
along
with
outspread
wings
he
chirrups
and
every
note
every
ruffled
feather
on
his
little
body
is
breathing
with
health
and
strength
what
follows
from
that
nothing
he
is
well
and
has
a
right
to
chirrup
and
ruffle
his
wings
but
i
am
ill
and
must
die
that
all
it
not
worth
while
to
say
more
about
it
and
tearful
invocations
to
nature
are
mortally
absurd
let
us
get
back
to
my
story
i
was
brought
up
as
i
have
said
very
badly
and
not
happily
i
had
no
brothers
or
sisters
i
was
educated
at
home
and
indeed
what
would
my
mother
have
had
to
occupy
her
if
i
had
been
sent
to
a
or
a
government
college
that
what
children
are
for
that
their
parents
may
not
be
bored
we
lived
for
the
most
part
in
the
country
and
sometimes
went
to
moscow
i
had
tutors
and
teachers
as
a
matter
of
course
one
in
particular
has
remained
in
my
memory
a
tearful
german
rickmann
an
exceptionally
mournful
creature
cruelly
maltreated
by
destiny
and
fruitlessly
consumed
by
an
intense
pining
for
his
fatherland
sometimes
near
the
stove
in
the
fearful
stuffiness
of
the
close
full
of
the
sour
smell
of
stale
kvas
my
unshaved
vassily
nicknamed
goose
would
sit
playing
cards
with
the
coachman
potap
in
a
new
sheepskin
white
as
foam
and
superb
tarred
boots
while
in
the
next
room
rickmann
would
sing
behind
the
partition
herz

herz

so
traurig

after
my
father
death
we
moved
to
moscow
for
good
i
was
twelve
years
old
my
father
died
in
the
night
from
a
stroke
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
i
was
sleeping
soundly
as
children
generally
do
but
i
remember
even
in
my
sleep
i
was
aware
of
a
heavy
gasping
noise
at
regular
intervals
suddenly
i
felt
some
one
taking
hold
of
my
shoulder
and
poking
me
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
my
nurse
is
it
along
come
along
alexey
mihalitch
is
dying
i
was
out
of
bed
and
away
like
a
mad
thing
into
his
bedroom
i
looked
my
father
was
lying
with
his
head
thrown
back
all
red
and
gasping
fearfully
the
servants
were
crowding
round
the
door
with
terrified
faces
in
the
hall
some
one
was
asking
in
a
thick
voice
they
sent
for
the
doctor
in
the
yard
outside
a
horse
was
being
led
from
the
stable
the
gates
were
creaking
a
tallow
candle
was
burning
in
the
room
on
the
floor
my
mother
was
there
terribly
upset
but
not
oblivious
of
the
proprieties
nor
of
her
own
dignity
i
flung
myself
on
my
father
bosom
and
hugged
him
faltering
papa
he
lay
motionless
screwing
up
his
eyes
in
a
strange
way
i
looked
into
his
face
an
unendurable
horror
caught
my
breath
i
shrieked
with
terror
like
a
roughly
captured
bird
they
picked
me
up
and
carried
me
away
only
the
day
before
as
though
aware
his
death
was
at
hand
he
had
caressed
me
so
passionately
and
despondently
a
sleepy
unkempt
doctor
smelling
strongly
of
spirits
was
brought
my
father
died
under
his
lancet
and
the
next
day
utterly
stupefied
by
grief
i
stood
with
a
candle
in
my
hands
before
a
table
on
which
lay
the
dead
man
and
listened
senselessly
to
the
bass
of
the
deacon
interrupted
from
time
to
time
by
the
weak
voice
of
the
priest
the
tears
kept
streaming
over
my
cheeks
my
lips
my
collar
my
i
was
dissolved
in
tears
i
watched
persistently
i
watched
intently
my
father
rigid
face
as
though
i
expected
something
of
him
while
my
mother
slowly
bowed
down
to
the
ground
slowly
rose
again
and
pressed
her
fingers
firmly
to
her
forehead
her
shoulders
and
her
chest
as
she
crossed
herself
i
had
not
a
single
idea
in
my
head
i
was
utterly
numb
but
i
felt
something
terrible
was
happening
to
me
death
looked
me
in
the
face
that
day
and
took
note
of
me
we
moved
to
moscow
after
my
father
death
for
a
very
simple
cause
all
our
estate
was
sold
up
by
auction
for
debts
that
is
absolutely
all
except
one
little
village
the
one
in
which
i
am
at
this
moment
living
out
my
magnificent
existence
i
must
admit
that
in
spite
of
my
youth
at
the
time
i
grieved
over
the
sale
of
our
home
or
rather
in
reality
i
grieved
over
our
garden
almost
my
only
bright
memories
are
associated
with
our
garden
it
was
there
that
one
mild
spring
evening
i
buried
my
best
friend
an
old
dog
trix
it
was
there
that
hidden
in
the
long
grass
i
used
to
eat
stolen
apples
sweet
red
novgorod
apples
they
were
there
too
i
saw
for
the
first
time
among
the
ripe
raspberry
bushes
the
housemaid
klavdia
who
in
spite
of
her
nose
and
habit
of
giggling
in
her
kerchief
aroused
such
a
tender
passion
in
me
that
i
could
hardly
breathe
and
stood
faint
and
in
her
presence
and
once
at
easter
when
it
came
to
her
turn
to
kiss
my
seignorial
hand
i
almost
flung
myself
at
her
feet
to
kiss
her
slippers
my
god
can
all
that
be
twenty
years
ago
it
seems
not
long
ago
that
i
used
to
ride
on
my
shaggy
chestnut
pony
along
the
old
fence
of
our
garden
and
standing
up
in
the
stirrups
used
to
pick
the
poplar
leaves
while
a
man
is
living
he
is
not
conscious
of
his
own
life
it
becomes
audible
to
him
like
a
sound
after
the
lapse
of
time
oh
my
garden
oh
the
tangled
paths
by
the
tiny
pond
oh
the
little
sandy
spot
below
the
tumbledown
dike
where
i
used
to
catch
gudgeons
and
you
tall
with
long
hanging
branches
from
beyond
which
came
floating
a
peasant
mournful
song
broken
by
the
uneven
jolting
of
the
cart
i
send
you
my
last
farewell
on
parting
with
life
to
you
alone
i
stretch
out
my
hands
would
i
might
once
more
inhale
the
fresh
bitter
fragrance
of
the
wormwood
the
sweet
scent
of
the
mown
buckwheat
in
the
fields
of
my
native
place
would
i
might
once
more
hear
far
away
the
modest
tinkle
of
the
cracked
bell
of
our
parish
church
once
more
lie
in
the
cool
shade
under
the
oak
sapling
on
the
slope
of
the
familiar
ravine
once
more
watch
the
moving
track
of
the
wind
flitting
a
dark
wave
over
the
golden
grass
of
our
meadow
ah
what
the
good
of
all
this
but
i
ca
go
on
enough
till
it
cold
and
overcast
again
such
weather
is
a
great
deal
more
suitable
it
more
in
harmony
with
my
task
yesterday
quite
inappropriately
stirred
up
a
multitude
of
useless
emotions
and
memories
within
me
this
shall
not
occur
again
sentimental
are
like
liquorice
when
first
you
suck
it
it
not
bad
but
afterwards
it
leaves
a
very
nasty
taste
in
the
mouth
i
will
set
to
work
simply
and
serenely
to
tell
the
story
of
my
life
and
so
we
moved
to
moscow
but
it
occurs
to
me
is
it
really
worth
while
to
tell
the
story
of
my
life
no
it
certainly
is
not
my
life
has
not
been
different
in
any
respect
from
the
lives
of
numbers
of
other
people
the
parental
home
the
university
the
government
service
in
the
lower
grades
retirement
a
little
circle
of
friends
decent
poverty
modest
pleasures
unambitious
pursuits
moderate
desires
kindly
tell
me
is
that
new
to
any
one
and
so
i
will
not
tell
the
story
of
my
life
especially
as
i
am
writing
for
my
own
pleasure
and
if
my
past
does
not
afford
even
me
any
sensation
of
great
pleasure
or
great
pain
it
must
be
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
deserving
of
attention
i
had
better
try
to
describe
my
own
character
to
myself
what
manner
of
man
am
i
it
may
be
observed
that
no
one
asks
me
that
question
admitted
but
there
i
dying
by
jove
i
dying
and
at
the
point
of
death
i
really
think
one
may
be
excused
a
desire
to
find
out
what
sort
of
a
queer
fish
one
really
was
after
all
thinking
over
this
important
question
and
having
moreover
no
need
whatever
to
be
too
bitter
in
my
expressions
in
regard
to
myself
as
people
are
apt
to
be
who
have
a
strong
conviction
of
their
valuable
qualities
i
must
admit
one
thing
i
was
a
man
or
perhaps
i
should
say
a
fish
utterly
superfluous
in
this
world
and
that
i
propose
to
show
as
i
keep
coughing
like
an
old
sheep
and
my
nurse
terentyevna
gives
me
no
peace
down
my
good
sir
she
says
drink
a
little
i
know
why
she
keeps
on
at
me
she
wants
some
tea
herself
well
she
welcome
why
not
let
the
poor
old
woman
extract
the
utmost
benefit
she
can
from
her
master
at
the
last
as
long
as
there
is
still
the
chance
winter
again
the
snow
is
falling
in
flakes
superfluous
superfluous
that
a
capital
word
i
have
hit
on
the
more
deeply
i
probe
into
myself
the
more
intently
i
review
all
my
past
life
the
more
i
am
convinced
of
the
strict
truth
of
this
expression
superfluous
that
just
it
to
other
people
that
term
is
not
applicable
people
are
bad
or
good
clever
stupid
pleasant
and
disagreeable
but
superfluous
no
understand
me
though
the
universe
could
get
on
without
those
people
too
no
doubt
but
uselessness
is
not
their
prime
characteristic
their
most
distinctive
attribute
and
when
you
speak
of
them
the
word
is
not
the
first
to
rise
to
your
lips
but
i
there
nothing
else
one
can
say
about
me
i
superfluous
and
nothing
more
a
supernumerary
and
that
all
nature
apparently
did
not
reckon
on
my
appearance
and
consequently
treated
me
as
an
unexpected
and
uninvited
guest
a
facetious
gentleman
a
great
devotee
of
preference
said
very
happily
about
me
that
i
was
the
forfeit
my
mother
had
paid
at
the
game
of
life
i
am
speaking
about
myself
calmly
now
without
any
bitterness
all
over
and
done
with
throughout
my
whole
life
i
was
constantly
finding
my
place
taken
perhaps
because
i
did
not
look
for
my
place
where
i
should
have
done
i
was
apprehensive
reserved
and
irritable
like
all
sickly
people
moreover
probably
owing
to
excessive
perhaps
as
the
result
of
the
generally
unfortunate
cast
of
my
personality
there
existed
between
my
thoughts
and
feelings
and
the
expression
of
those
feelings
and
thoughts
a
sort
of
inexplicable
irrational
and
utterly
insuperable
barrier
and
whenever
i
made
up
my
mind
to
overcome
this
obstacle
by
force
to
break
down
this
barrier
my
gestures
the
expression
of
my
face
my
whole
being
took
on
an
appearance
of
painful
constraint
i
not
only
seemed
i
positively
became
unnatural
and
affected
i
was
conscious
of
this
myself
and
hastened
to
shrink
back
into
myself
then
a
terrible
commotion
was
set
up
within
me
i
analysed
myself
to
the
last
thread
compared
myself
with
others
recalled
the
slightest
glances
smiles
words
of
the
people
to
whom
i
had
tried
to
open
myself
out
put
the
worst
construction
on
everything
laughed
vindictively
at
my
own
pretensions
to
like
every
one
else
and
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
my
laughter
collapsed
utterly
into
gloom
sank
into
absurd
dejection
and
then
began
again
as
before
went
round
and
round
in
fact
like
a
squirrel
on
its
wheel
whole
days
were
spent
in
this
harassing
fruitless
exercise
well
now
tell
me
if
you
please
to
whom
and
for
what
is
such
a
man
of
use
why
did
this
happen
to
me
what
was
the
reason
of
this
trivial
fretting
at
myself
who
knows
who
can
tell
i
remember
i
was
driving
once
from
moscow
in
the
diligence
it
was
a
good
road
but
the
driver
though
he
had
four
horses
harnessed
abreast
hitched
on
another
alongside
of
them
such
an
unfortunate
utterly
useless
fifth
horse
fastened
somehow
on
to
the
front
of
the
shaft
by
a
short
stout
cord
which
mercilessly
cuts
his
shoulder
forces
him
to
go
with
the
most
unnatural
action
and
gives
his
whole
body
the
shape
of
a
comma
always
arouses
my
deepest
pity
i
remarked
to
the
driver
that
i
thought
we
might
on
this
occasion
have
got
on
without
the
fifth
horse
he
was
silent
a
moment
shook
his
head
lashed
the
horse
a
dozen
times
across
his
thin
back
and
under
his
distended
belly
and
with
a
grin
responded
to
be
sure
why
do
we
drag
him
along
with
us
what
the
devil
he
for
and
here
am
i
too
dragged
along
but
thank
goodness
the
station
is
not
far
off
superfluous
i
promised
to
show
the
justice
of
my
opinion
and
i
will
carry
out
my
promise
i
do
think
it
necessary
to
mention
the
thousand
trifles
everyday
incidents
and
events
which
would
however
in
the
eyes
of
any
thinking
man
serve
as
irrefutable
evidence
in
my
support
i
mean
in
support
of
my
contention
i
had
better
begin
straight
away
with
one
rather
important
incident
after
which
probably
there
will
be
no
doubt
left
of
the
accuracy
of
the
term
superfluous
i
repeat
i
do
not
intend
to
indulge
in
minute
details
but
i
can
not
pass
over
in
silence
one
rather
serious
and
significant
fact
that
is
the
strange
behaviour
of
my
friends
i
too
used
to
have
friends
whenever
i
met
them
or
even
called
on
them
they
used
to
seem
ill
at
ease
as
they
came
to
meet
me
they
would
give
a
not
quite
natural
smile
look
not
into
my
eyes
nor
at
my
feet
as
some
people
do
but
rather
at
my
cheeks
articulate
hurriedly
how
are
you
tchulkaturin
such
is
the
surname
fate
has
burdened
me
with
or
here
tchulkaturin
turn
away
at
once
and
positively
remain
stockstill
for
a
little
while
after
as
though
trying
to
recollect
something
i
used
to
notice
all
this
as
i
am
not
devoid
of
penetration
and
the
faculty
of
observation
on
the
whole
i
am
not
a
fool
i
sometimes
even
have
ideas
come
into
my
head
that
are
amusing
not
absolutely
commonplace
but
as
i
am
a
superfluous
man
with
a
padlock
on
my
inner
self
it
is
very
painful
for
me
to
express
my
idea
the
more
so
as
i
know
beforehand
that
i
shall
express
it
badly
it
positively
sometimes
strikes
me
as
extraordinary
the
way
people
manage
to
talk
and
so
simply
and
freely
marvellous
really
when
you
think
of
it
though
to
tell
the
truth
i
too
in
spite
of
my
padlock
sometimes
have
an
itch
to
talk
but
i
did
actually
utter
words
only
in
my
youth
in
riper
years
i
almost
always
pulled
myself
up
i
would
murmur
to
myself
we
better
hold
our
tongue
and
i
was
still
we
are
all
good
hands
at
being
silent
our
women
especially
are
great
in
that
line
many
an
exalted
russian
young
lady
keeps
silent
so
strenuously
that
the
spectacle
is
calculated
to
produce
a
faint
shudder
and
cold
sweat
even
in
any
one
prepared
to
face
it
but
that
not
the
point
and
it
not
for
me
to
criticise
others
i
proceed
to
my
promised
narrative
a
few
years
back
owing
to
a
combination
of
circumstances
very
insignificant
in
themselves
but
very
important
for
me
it
was
my
lot
to
spend
six
months
in
the
district
town
o
this
town
is
all
built
on
a
slope
and
very
uncomfortably
built
too
there
are
reckoned
to
be
about
eight
hundred
inhabitants
in
it
of
exceptional
poverty
the
houses
are
hardly
worthy
of
the
name
in
the
chief
street
by
way
of
an
apology
for
a
pavement
there
are
here
and
there
some
huge
white
slabs
of
limestone
in
consequence
of
which
even
carts
drive
round
it
instead
of
through
it
in
the
very
middle
of
an
astoundingly
dirty
square
rises
a
diminutive
yellowish
edifice
with
black
holes
in
it
and
in
these
holes
sit
men
in
big
caps
making
a
pretence
of
buying
and
selling
in
this
place
there
is
an
extraordinarily
high
striped
post
sticking
up
into
the
air
and
near
the
post
in
the
interests
of
public
order
by
command
of
the
authorities
there
is
kept
a
cartload
of
yellow
hay
and
one
government
hen
struts
to
and
fro
in
short
existence
in
the
town
of
o
is
truly
delightful
during
the
first
days
of
my
stay
in
this
town
i
almost
went
out
of
my
mind
with
boredom
i
ought
to
say
of
myself
that
though
i
am
no
doubt
a
superfluous
man
i
am
not
so
of
my
own
seeking
i
morbid
myself
but
i
ca
bear
anything
morbid
i
not
even
averse
to
happiness
indeed
i
tried
to
approach
it
right
and
left
and
so
it
is
no
wonder
that
i
too
can
be
bored
like
any
other
mortal
i
was
staying
in
the
town
of
o
on
official
business
terentyevna
has
certainly
sworn
to
make
an
end
of
me
here
a
specimen
of
our
conversation
terentyevna
oh
oh
my
good
sir

are

ever
writing
for
it

terentyevna
she
eh
eh
good
sir
why
do
you
talk
so
well
i
go
and
heat
the
samovar
oh
decrepit
yellow
toothless
creature
am
i
really
even
in
your
eyes
not
a
man
sharp
on
the
very
day
of
my
arrival
in
the
town
of
o
the
official
business
above
referred
to
brought
me
into
contact
with
a
certain
kirilla
matveitch
ozhogin
one
of
the
chief
functionaries
of
the
district
but
i
became
intimate
or
as
it
is
called
with
him
a
fortnight
later
his
house
was
in
the
principal
street
and
was
distinguished
from
all
the
others
by
its
size
its
painted
roof
and
the
lions
on
its
gates
lions
of
that
species
extraordinarily
resembling
unsuccessful
dogs
whose
natural
home
is
moscow
from
those
lions
alone
one
might
safely
conclude
that
ozhogin
was
a
man
of
property
and
so
it
was
he
was
the
owner
of
four
hundred
peasants
he
entertained
in
his
house
all
the
best
society
of
the
town
of
o
and
had
a
reputation
for
hospitality
at
his
door
was
seen
the
mayor
with
his
wide
droshky
and
pair
an
exceptionally
bulky
man
who
seemed
as
though
cut
out
of
material
that
had
been
laid
by
for
a
long
time
the
other
officials
too
used
to
drive
to
his
receptions
the
attorney
a
yellowish
spiteful
creature
the
land
surveyor
a
wit
of
german
extraction
with
a
tartar
face
the
inspector
of
means
of
communication
a
soft
soul
who
sang
songs
but
a
scandalmonger
a
former
marshal
of
the
district
a
gentleman
with
dyed
hair
crumpled
shirt
front
and
tight
trousers
and
that
lofty
expression
of
face
so
characteristic
of
men
who
have
stood
on
trial
there
used
to
come
also
two
landowners
inseparable
friends
both
no
longer
young
and
indeed
a
little
the
worse
for
wear
of
whom
the
younger
was
continually
crushing
the
elder
and
putting
him
to
silence
with
one
and
the
same
reproach
you
talk
sergei
sergeitch
what
have
you
to
say
why
you
spell
the
word
cork
with
two
in
it
yes
gentlemen
he
would
go
on
with
all
the
fire
of
conviction
turning
to
the
bystanders
sergeitch
spells
it
not
cork
but
kork
and
every
one
present
would
laugh
though
probably
not
one
of
them
was
conspicuous
for
special
accuracy
in
orthography
while
the
luckless
sergei
sergeitch
held
his
tongue
and
with
a
faint
smile
bowed
his
head
but
i
am
forgetting
that
my
hours
are
numbered
and
am
letting
myself
go
into
too
minute
descriptions
and
so
without
further
beating
about
the
bush
ozhogin
was
married
he
had
a
daughter
elizaveta
kirillovna
and
i
fell
in
love
with
this
daughter
ozhogin
himself
was
a
commonplace
person
neither
nor
his
wife
resembled
an
aged
chicken
but
their
daughter
had
not
taken
after
her
parents
she
was
very
pretty
and
of
a
bright
and
gentle
disposition
her
clear
grey
eyes
looked
out
kindly
and
directly
from
under
childishly
arched
brows
she
was
almost
always
smiling
and
she
laughed
too
pretty
often
her
fresh
voice
had
a
very
pleasant
ring
she
moved
freely
rapidly
and
blushed
gaily
she
did
not
dress
very
stylishly
only
plain
dresses
suited
her
i
did
not
make
friends
quickly
as
a
rule
and
if
i
were
at
ease
with
any
one
from
the
first
which
however
scarcely
ever
occurred
it
said
i
must
own
a
great
deal
for
my
new
acquaintance
i
did
not
know
at
all
how
to
behave
with
women
and
in
their
presence
i
either
scowled
and
put
on
a
morose
air
or
grinned
in
the
most
idiotic
way
and
in
my
embarrassment
turned
my
tongue
round
and
round
in
my
mouth
with
elizaveta
kirillovna
on
the
contrary
i
felt
at
home
from
the
first
moment
it
happened
in
this
way
i
called
one
day
at
ozhogin
before
dinner
asked
home
was
told
master
at
home
dressing
please
to
walk
into
the
i
went
into
the
i
beheld
standing
at
the
window
with
her
back
to
me
a
girl
in
a
white
gown
with
a
cage
in
her
hands
i
was
as
my
way
was
somewhat
taken
aback
however
i
showed
no
sign
of
it
but
merely
coughed
for
good
manners
the
girl
turned
round
quickly
so
quickly
that
her
curls
gave
her
a
slap
in
the
face
saw
me
bowed
and
with
a
smile
showed
me
a
little
box
half
full
of
seeds
do
mind
i
of
course
as
is
the
usual
practice
in
such
cases
first
bowed
my
head
and
at
the
same
time
rapidly
crooked
my
knees
and
straightened
them
out
again
as
though
some
one
had
given
me
a
blow
from
behind
in
the
legs
a
sure
sign
of
good
breeding
and
pleasant
easy
manners
and
then
smiled
raised
my
hand
and
softly
and
carefully
brandished
it
twice
in
the
air
the
girl
at
once
turned
away
from
me
took
a
little
piece
of
board
out
of
the
cage
began
vigorously
scraping
it
with
a
knife
and
suddenly
without
changing
her
attitude
uttered
the
following
words
is
papa
parrot
are
you
fond
of
parrots
prefer
siskins
i
answered
not
without
some
effort
like
siskins
too
but
look
at
him
is
he
pretty
look
he
not
afraid
what
surprised
me
was
that
i
was
not
afraid
closer
his
name
popka
i
went
up
and
bent
down
he
really
sweet
she
turned
her
face
to
me
but
we
were
standing
so
close
together
that
she
had
to
throw
her
head
back
to
get
a
look
at
me
with
her
clear
eyes
i
gazed
at
her
her
rosy
young
face
was
smiling
all
over
in
such
a
friendly
way
that
i
smiled
too
and
almost
laughed
aloud
with
delight
the
door
opened
ozhogin
came
in
i
promptly
went
up
to
him
and
began
talking
to
him
very
unconstrainedly
i
do
know
how
it
was
but
i
stayed
to
dinner
and
spent
the
whole
evening
with
them
and
next
day
the
ozhogins
footman
an
elongated
person
smiled
upon
me
as
a
friend
of
the
family
when
he
helped
me
off
with
my
overcoat
to
find
a
haven
of
refuge
to
build
oneself
even
a
temporary
nest
to
feel
the
comfort
of
daily
intercourse
and
habits
was
a
happiness
i
a
superfluous
man
with
no
family
associations
had
never
before
experienced
if
anything
about
me
had
had
any
resemblance
to
a
flower
and
if
the
comparison
were
not
so
hackneyed
i
would
venture
to
say
that
my
soul
blossomed
from
that
day
everything
within
me
and
about
me
was
suddenly
transformed
my
whole
life
was
lighted
up
by
love
the
whole
of
it
down
to
the
paltriest
details
like
a
dark
deserted
room
when
a
light
has
been
brought
into
it
i
went
to
bed
and
got
up
dressed
ate
my
breakfast
and
smoked
my
pipe
differently
from
before
i
positively
skipped
along
as
i
walked
as
though
wings
were
suddenly
sprouting
from
my
shoulders
i
was
not
for
an
instant
i
remember
in
uncertainty
with
regard
to
the
feeling
elizaveta
kirillovna
inspired
in
me
i
fell
passionately
in
love
with
her
from
the
first
day
and
from
the
first
day
i
knew
i
was
in
love
during
the
course
of
three
weeks
i
saw
her
every
day
those
three
weeks
were
the
happiest
time
in
my
life
but
the
recollection
of
them
is
painful
to
me
i
ca
think
of
them
alone
i
can
not
help
dwelling
on
what
followed
after
them
and
the
intensest
bitterness
slowly
takes
possession
of
my
softened
heart
when
a
man
is
very
happy
his
brain
as
is
well
known
is
not
very
active
a
calm
and
delicious
sensation
the
sensation
of
satisfaction
pervades
his
whole
being
he
is
swallowed
up
by
it
the
consciousness
of
personal
life
vanishes
in
him
he
is
in
beatitude
as
badly
educated
poets
say
but
when
at
last
this
is
over
a
man
is
sometimes
vexed
and
sorry
that
in
the
midst
of
his
bliss
he
observed
himself
so
little
that
he
did
not
by
reflection
by
recollection
redouble
and
prolong
his
feelings
as
though
the
man
had
time
and
it
were
worth
his
while
to
reflect
on
his
sensations
the
happy
man
is
what
the
fly
is
in
the
sunshine
and
so
it
is
that
when
i
recall
those
three
weeks
it
is
almost
impossible
for
me
to
retain
in
my
mind
any
exact
and
definite
impression
all
the
more
so
as
during
that
time
nothing
very
remarkable
took
place
between
us
those
twenty
days
are
present
to
my
imagination
as
something
warm
and
young
and
fragrant
a
sort
of
streak
of
light
in
my
dingy
greyish
life
my
memory
becomes
all
at
once
remorselessly
clear
and
trustworthy
only
from
the
instant
when
to
use
the
phrase
of
writers
the
blows
of
destiny
began
to
fall
upon
me
yes
those
three
weeks
not
but
what
they
have
left
some
images
in
my
mind
sometimes
when
it
happens
to
me
to
brood
a
long
while
on
that
time
some
memories
suddenly
float
up
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
past
like
stars
which
suddenly
come
out
against
the
evening
sky
to
meet
the
eyes
straining
to
catch
sight
of
them
one
country
walk
in
a
wood
has
remained
particularly
distinct
in
my
memory
there
were
four
of
us
old
madame
ozhogin
liza
i
and
a
certain
bizmyonkov
a
petty
official
of
the
town
of
o
a
and
harmless
person
i
shall
have
more
to
say
of
him
later
ozhogin
had
stayed
at
home
he
had
a
headache
from
sleeping
too
long
the
day
was
exquisite
warm
and
soft
i
must
observe
that
and
are
not
to
the
taste
of
the
average
russian
in
district
towns
in
the
public
gardens
you
never
meet
a
living
soul
at
any
time
of
the
year
at
the
most
some
old
woman
sits
sighing
and
moaning
on
a
green
garden
seat
broiling
in
the
sun
not
far
from
a
sickly
tree
and
that
only
if
there
is
no
greasy
little
bench
in
the
gateway
near
but
if
there
happens
to
be
a
scraggy
birchwood
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
town
tradespeople
and
even
officials
gladly
make
excursions
thither
on
sundays
and
holidays
with
samovars
pies
and
melons
set
all
this
abundance
on
the
dusty
grass
close
by
the
road
sit
round
and
eat
and
drink
tea
in
the
sweat
of
their
brows
till
evening
just
such
a
wood
there
was
at
that
time
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
town
of
o
we
repaired
there
after
dinner
duly
drank
our
fill
of
tea
and
then
all
four
began
to
wander
about
the
wood
bizmyonkov
walked
with
madame
ozhogin
on
his
arm
i
with
liza
on
mine
the
day
was
already
drawing
to
evening
i
was
at
that
time
in
the
very
fire
of
first
love
not
more
than
a
fortnight
had
passed
since
our
first
meeting
in
that
condition
of
passionate
and
concentrated
adoration
when
your
whole
soul
innocently
and
unconsciously
follows
every
movement
of
the
beloved
being
when
you
can
never
have
enough
of
her
presence
listen
enough
to
her
voice
when
you
smile
with
the
look
of
a
child
convalescent
after
sickness
and
a
man
of
the
smallest
experience
can
not
fail
at
the
first
glance
to
recognise
a
hundred
yards
off
what
is
the
matter
with
you
till
that
day
i
had
never
happened
to
have
liza
on
my
arm
we
walked
side
by
side
stepping
slowly
over
the
green
grass
a
light
breeze
as
it
were
flitted
about
us
between
the
white
stems
of
the
birches
every
now
and
then
flapping
the
ribbon
of
her
hat
into
my
face
i
incessantly
followed
her
eyes
until
at
last
she
turned
gaily
to
me
and
we
both
smiled
at
each
other
the
birds
were
chirping
approvingly
above
us
the
blue
sky
peeped
caressingly
at
us
through
the
delicate
foliage
my
head
was
going
round
with
excess
of
bliss
i
hasten
to
remark
liza
was
not
a
bit
in
love
with
me
she
liked
me
she
was
never
shy
with
any
one
but
it
was
not
reserved
for
me
to
trouble
her
childlike
peace
of
mind
she
walked
arm
in
arm
with
me
as
she
would
with
a
brother
she
was
seventeen
then
and
meanwhile
that
very
evening
before
my
eyes
there
began
that
soft
inward
ferment
which
precedes
the
metamorphosis
of
the
child
into
the
woman
i
was
witness
of
that
transformation
of
the
whole
being
that
guileless
bewilderment
that
agitated
dreaminess
i
was
the
first
to
detect
the
sudden
softness
of
the
glance
the
sudden
ring
in
the
voice
and
oh
fool
oh
superfluous
man
for
a
whole
week
i
had
the
face
to
imagine
that
i
i
was
the
cause
of
this
transformation
this
was
how
it
happened
we
walked
rather
a
long
while
till
evening
and
talked
little
i
was
silent
like
all
inexperienced
lovers
and
she
probably
had
nothing
to
say
to
me
but
she
seemed
to
be
pondering
over
something
and
shook
her
head
in
a
peculiar
way
as
she
pensively
nibbled
a
leaf
she
had
picked
sometimes
she
started
walking
ahead
so
resolutely
then
all
at
once
stopped
waited
for
me
and
looked
round
with
lifted
eyebrows
and
a
vague
smile
on
the
previous
evening
we
had
read
together
prisoner
of
the
with
what
eagerness
she
had
listened
to
me
her
face
propped
in
both
hands
and
her
bosom
pressed
against
the
table
i
began
to
speak
of
our
yesterday
reading
she
flushed
asked
me
whether
i
had
given
the
parrot
any
before
starting
began
humming
some
little
song
aloud
and
all
at
once
was
silent
again
the
copse
ended
on
one
side
in
a
rather
high
and
abrupt
precipice
below
coursed
a
winding
stream
and
beyond
it
over
an
immense
expanse
stretched
the
boundless
prairies
rising
like
waves
spreading
wide
like
a
and
broken
here
and
there
by
ravines
liza
and
i
were
the
first
to
come
out
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
bizmyonkov
and
the
elder
lady
were
behind
we
came
out
stood
still
and
involuntarily
we
both
half
shut
our
eyes
directly
facing
us
across
a
lurid
mist
the
vast
purple
sun
was
setting
half
the
sky
was
flushed
and
glowing
red
rays
fell
slanting
on
the
meadows
casting
a
crimson
reflection
even
on
the
side
of
the
ravines
in
shadow
lying
in
gleams
of
fire
on
the
stream
where
it
was
not
hidden
under
the
overhanging
bushes
and
as
it
were
leaning
on
the
bosom
of
the
precipice
and
the
copse
we
stood
bathed
in
the
blazing
brilliance
i
am
not
capable
of
describing
all
the
impassioned
solemnity
of
this
scene
they
say
that
by
a
blind
man
the
colour
red
is
imagined
as
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
i
do
know
how
far
this
comparison
is
correct
but
really
there
was
something
of
a
challenge
in
this
glowing
gold
of
the
evening
air
in
the
crimson
flush
on
sky
and
earth
i
uttered
a
cry
of
rapture
and
at
once
turned
to
liza
she
was
looking
straight
at
the
sun
i
remember
the
sunset
glow
was
reflected
in
little
points
of
fire
in
her
eyes
she
was
overwhelmed
deeply
moved
she
made
no
response
to
my
exclamation
for
a
long
while
she
stood
not
stirring
with
drooping
head
i
held
out
my
hand
to
her
she
turned
away
from
me
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
i
looked
at
her
with
secret
almost
delighted
amazement
the
voice
of
bizmyonkov
was
heard
a
couple
of
yards
off
liza
quickly
wiped
her
tears
and
looked
with
a
faltering
smile
at
me
the
elder
lady
came
out
of
the
copse
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
escort
they
in
their
turn
admired
the
view
the
old
lady
addressed
some
question
to
liza
and
i
could
not
help
shuddering
i
remember
when
her
broken
voice
like
cracked
glass
sounded
in
reply
meanwhile
the
sun
had
set
and
the
afterglow
began
to
fade
we
turned
back
again
i
took
liza
arm
in
mine
it
was
still
light
in
the
wood
and
i
could
clearly
distinguish
her
features
she
was
confused
and
did
not
raise
her
eyes
the
flush
that
overspread
her
face
did
not
vanish
it
was
as
though
she
were
still
standing
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
her
hand
scarcely
touched
my
arm
for
a
long
while
i
could
not
frame
a
sentence
my
heart
was
beating
so
violently
through
the
trees
there
was
a
glimpse
of
the
carriage
in
the
distance
the
coachman
was
coming
at
a
walking
pace
to
meet
us
over
the
soft
sand
of
the
road
kirillovna
i
brought
out
at
last
did
you
cry
for
do
know
she
answered
after
a
short
silence
she
looked
at
me
with
her
soft
eyes
still
wet
with
tears
her
look
struck
me
as
changed
and
she
was
silent
again
are
very
fond
i
see
of
nature
i
pursued
that
was
not
at
all
what
i
meant
to
say
and
the
last
words
my
tongue
scarcely
faltered
out
to
the
end
she
shook
her
head
i
could
not
utter
another
word
i
was
waiting
for
something
not
an
avowal
how
was
that
possible
i
waited
for
a
confiding
glance
a
question
but
liza
looked
at
the
ground
and
kept
silent
i
repeated
once
more
in
a
whisper
was
it
and
received
no
reply
she
had
grown
i
saw
that
ill
at
ease
almost
ashamed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
were
sitting
in
the
carriage
driving
to
the
town
the
horses
flew
along
at
an
even
trot
we
were
rapidly
whirled
along
through
the
darkening
damp
air
i
suddenly
began
talking
more
than
once
addressing
first
bizmyonkov
and
then
madame
ozhogin
i
did
not
look
at
liza
but
i
could
see
that
from
her
corner
in
the
carriage
her
eyes
did
not
once
rest
on
me
at
home
she
roused
herself
but
would
not
read
with
me
and
soon
went
off
to
bed
a
that
i
have
spoken
of
had
been
reached
by
her
she
had
ceased
to
be
a
little
girl
she
too
had
begun
like
me
to
wait
for
something
she
had
not
long
to
wait
but
that
night
i
went
home
to
my
lodgings
in
a
state
of
perfect
ecstasy
the
vague
half
presentiment
half
suspicion
which
had
been
arising
within
me
had
vanished
the
sudden
constraint
in
liza
manner
towards
me
i
ascribed
to
maidenly
bashfulness
timidity
had
i
read
a
thousand
times
over
in
many
books
that
the
first
appearance
of
love
always
agitates
and
alarms
a
young
girl
i
felt
supremely
happy
and
was
already
making
all
sorts
of
plans
in
my
head
if
some
one
had
whispered
in
my
ear
then
raving
my
dear
chap
that
not
a
bit
what
in
store
for
you
what
in
store
for
you
is
to
die
all
alone
in
a
wretched
little
cottage
amid
the
insufferable
grumbling
of
an
old
hag
who
will
await
your
death
with
impatience
to
sell
your
boots
for
a
few
coppers
yes
one
ca
help
saying
with
the
russian
philosopher
one
to
know
what
one
does
know
enough
for
a
white
winter
i
have
read
over
what
i
wrote
yesterday
and
was
all
but
tearing
up
the
whole
manuscript
i
think
my
story
too
spun
out
and
too
sentimental
however
as
the
rest
of
my
recollections
of
that
time
presents
nothing
of
a
pleasurable
character
except
that
peculiar
sort
of
consolation
which
lermontov
had
in
view
when
he
said
there
is
pleasure
and
pain
in
irritating
the
sores
of
old
wounds
why
not
indulge
oneself
but
one
must
know
where
to
draw
the
line
and
so
i
will
continue
without
any
sort
of
sentimentality
during
the
whole
of
the
week
after
the
country
excursion
my
position
was
in
reality
in
no
way
improved
though
the
change
in
liza
became
more
noticeable
every
day
i
interpreted
this
change
as
i
have
said
before
in
the
most
favourable
way
for
me
the
misfortune
of
solitary
and
timid
people
who
are
timid
from
is
just
that
though
they
have
eyes
and
indeed
open
them
wide
they
see
nothing
or
see
everything
in
a
false
light
as
though
through
coloured
spectacles
their
own
ideas
and
speculations
trip
them
up
at
every
step
at
the
commencement
of
our
acquaintance
liza
behaved
confidingly
and
freely
with
me
like
a
child
perhaps
there
may
even
have
been
in
her
attitude
to
me
something
more
than
mere
childish
liking
but
after
this
strange
almost
instantaneous
change
had
taken
place
in
her
after
a
period
of
brief
perplexity
she
felt
constrained
in
my
presence
she
unconsciously
turned
away
from
me
and
was
at
the
same
time
melancholy
and
dreamy
she
was
waiting
for
what
she
did
not
know
while
i
i
as
i
have
said
above
was
delighted
at
this
change
yes
by
god
i
was
ready
to
expire
as
they
say
with
rapture
though
i
am
prepared
to
allow
that
any
one
else
in
my
place
might
have
been
deceived
who
is
free
from
vanity
i
need
not
say
that
all
this
was
only
clear
to
me
in
the
course
of
time
when
i
had
to
lower
my
clipped
and
at
no
time
wings
the
misunderstanding
that
had
arisen
between
liza
and
me
lasted
a
whole
week
and
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
that
it
has
been
my
lot
to
be
a
witness
of
misunderstandings
that
have
lasted
for
years
and
years
who
was
it
said
by
the
way
that
truth
alone
is
powerful
falsehood
is
just
as
living
as
truth
if
not
more
so
to
be
sure
i
recollect
that
even
during
that
week
i
felt
from
time
to
time
an
uneasy
gnawing
astir
within
me
but
solitary
people
like
me
i
say
again
are
as
incapable
of
understanding
what
is
going
on
within
them
as
what
is
taking
place
before
their
eyes
and
besides
is
love
a
natural
feeling
is
it
natural
for
man
to
love
love
is
a
sickness
and
for
sickness
there
is
no
law
granting
that
there
was
at
times
an
unpleasant
pang
in
my
heart
well
everything
inside
me
was
turned
upside
down
and
how
is
one
to
know
in
such
circumstances
what
is
all
right
and
what
is
all
wrong
and
what
is
the
cause
and
what
the
significance
of
each
separate
symptom
but
be
that
as
it
may
all
these
misconceptions
presentiments
and
hopes
were
shattered
in
the
following
manner
one
day
it
was
in
the
morning
about
twelve
i
had
hardly
entered
ozhogin
hall
when
i
heard
an
unfamiliar
mellow
voice
in
the
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
and
slim
man
of
appeared
in
the
doorway
escorted
by
the
master
of
the
house
he
rapidly
put
on
a
military
overcoat
which
lay
on
the
slab
and
took
cordial
leave
of
kirilla
matveitch
as
he
brushed
past
me
he
carelessly
touched
his
foraging
cap
and
vanished
with
a
clink
of
his
spurs
is
that
i
asked
ozhogin
latter
responded
with
a
preoccupied
face
from
petersburg
to
collect
recruits
but
where
are
the
servants
he
went
on
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
one
handed
him
his
coat
we
went
into
the
he
been
here
long
i
inquired
yesterday
evening
i
told
i
offered
him
a
room
here
but
he
refused
he
seems
a
very
nice
fellow
though
he
been
long
with
you
an
hour
he
asked
me
to
introduce
him
to
olimpiada
nikitishna
did
you
introduce
him
course
lizaveta
kirillovna
too
did
he
made
her
acquaintance
too
of
course
i
was
silent
for
a
space
he
come
here
for
long
do
you
know
i
believe
he
has
to
be
here
for
a
fortnight
and
kirilla
matveitch
hurried
away
to
dress
i
walked
several
times
up
and
down
the
i
do
recollect
that
prince
arrival
made
any
special
impression
on
me
at
the
time
except
that
feeling
of
hostility
which
usually
possesses
us
on
the
appearance
of
any
new
person
in
our
domestic
circle
possibly
there
was
mingled
with
this
feeling
something
too
of
the
nature
of
envy
of
a
shy
and
obscure
person
from
moscow
towards
a
brilliant
officer
from
petersburg
prince
i
mused
an
upstart
from
the
capital
he
look
down
upon
us
i
had
not
seen
him
for
more
than
an
instant
but
i
had
had
time
to
perceive
that
he
was
clever
and
at
his
ease
after
pacing
the
room
for
some
time
i
stopped
at
last
before
a
pulled
a
comb
out
of
my
pocket
gave
a
picturesque
carelessness
to
my
hair
and
as
sometimes
happens
became
suddenly
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
my
own
face
i
remember
my
attention
centred
anxiously
about
my
nose
the
soft
and
undefined
outlines
of
that
feature
afforded
me
no
great
satisfaction
when
suddenly
in
the
dark
depths
of
the
sloping
mirror
which
reflected
almost
the
whole
room
the
door
opened
and
the
slender
figure
of
liza
appeared
i
know
why
i
did
not
stir
and
kept
the
same
expression
on
my
face
liza
craned
her
head
forward
looked
intently
at
me
and
raising
her
eyebrows
biting
her
lips
and
holding
her
breath
as
any
one
does
who
is
glad
at
not
being
noticed
she
cautiously
drew
back
and
stealthily
drew
the
door
to
after
her
the
door
creaked
slightly
liza
started
and
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
i
still
kept
from
stirring
she
pulled
the
handle
again
and
vanished
there
was
no
possibility
of
doubt
the
expression
of
liza
face
at
the
sight
of
my
figure
that
expression
in
which
nothing
could
be
detected
except
a
desire
to
get
away
again
successfully
to
escape
a
disagreeable
interview
the
quick
flash
of
delight
i
had
time
to
catch
in
her
eyes
when
she
fancied
she
really
had
managed
to
creep
away
unnoticed
it
all
spoke
too
clearly
that
girl
did
not
love
me
for
a
long
long
while
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
that
motionless
dumb
door
which
was
once
more
a
patch
of
white
in
the
i
tried
to
smile
at
my
own
long
face
dropped
my
head
went
home
again
and
flung
myself
on
the
sofa
i
felt
extraordinarily
heavy
at
heart
so
much
so
that
i
could
not
cry
and
besides
what
was
there
to
cry
about
it
possible
i
repeated
incessantly
lying
as
though
i
were
murdered
on
my
back
with
my
hands
folded
on
my
breast
it
possible
do
you
think
that
rather
good
that
it
possible
when
next
day
after
long
hesitation
and
with
a
low
sinking
at
my
heart
i
went
into
the
ozhogins
familiar
i
was
no
longer
the
same
man
as
they
had
known
during
the
last
three
weeks
all
my
old
peculiarities
which
i
had
begun
to
get
over
under
the
influence
of
a
new
feeling
reappeared
and
took
possession
of
me
like
proprietors
returning
to
their
house
people
of
my
sort
are
usually
guided
not
so
much
by
positive
facts
as
by
their
own
impressions
i
who
no
longer
ago
than
the
day
before
had
been
dreaming
of
the
of
love
returned
was
that
day
no
less
convinced
of
my
and
was
absolutely
despairing
though
i
was
not
myself
able
to
find
any
rational
ground
for
my
despair
i
could
not
as
yet
be
jealous
of
prince
and
whatever
his
qualities
might
be
his
mere
arrival
was
not
sufficient
to
extinguish
liza
towards
me
at
once
but
stay
was
there
any
on
her
part
i
recalled
the
past
of
the
walk
in
the
wood
i
asked
myself
of
the
expression
of
her
face
in
the
glass
i
went
on
walk
in
the
wood
i
think
fie
on
me
my
god
what
a
wretched
creature
i
am
i
said
at
last
out
loud
of
such
sort
were
the
unphrased
incomplete
thoughts
that
went
round
and
round
a
thousand
times
over
in
a
monotonous
whirl
in
my
head
i
repeat
i
went
back
to
the
ozhogins
the
same
hypersensitive
suspicious
constrained
creature
i
had
been
from
my
childhood
up
i
found
the
whole
family
in
the
bizmyonkov
was
sitting
there
too
in
a
corner
every
one
seemed
in
high
ozhogin
in
particular
positively
beamed
and
his
first
word
was
to
tell
me
that
prince
had
spent
the
whole
of
the
previous
evening
with
them
liza
gave
me
a
tranquil
greeting
said
i
to
myself
i
understand
why
you
in
such
spirits
i
must
own
the
prince
second
visit
puzzled
me
i
had
not
anticipated
it
as
a
rule
fellows
like
me
anticipate
everything
in
the
world
except
what
is
bound
to
occur
in
the
natural
order
of
things
i
sulked
and
put
on
the
air
of
an
injured
but
magnanimous
person
i
tried
to
punish
liza
by
showing
my
displeasure
from
which
one
must
conclude
i
was
not
yet
completely
desperate
after
all
they
do
say
that
in
some
cases
when
one
is
really
loved
it
positively
of
use
to
torment
the
adored
one
but
in
my
position
it
was
indescribably
stupid
liza
in
the
most
innocent
way
paid
no
attention
to
me
no
one
but
madame
ozhogin
observed
my
solemn
taciturnity
and
she
inquired
anxiously
after
my
health
i
replied
of
course
with
a
bitter
smile
that
i
was
thankful
to
say
i
was
perfectly
well
ozhogin
continued
to
expatiate
on
the
subject
of
their
visitor
but
noticing
that
i
responded
reluctantly
he
addressed
himself
principally
to
bizmyonkov
who
was
listening
to
him
with
great
attention
when
a
servant
suddenly
came
in
announcing
the
arrival
of
prince
our
host
jumped
up
and
ran
to
meet
him
liza
upon
whom
i
at
once
turned
an
eagle
eye
flushed
with
delight
and
made
as
though
she
would
move
from
her
seat
the
prince
came
in
all
agreeable
perfume
gaiety
cordiality
as
i
am
not
composing
a
romance
for
a
gentle
reader
but
simply
writing
for
my
own
amusement
it
stands
to
reason
i
need
not
make
use
of
the
usual
dodges
of
our
respected
authors
i
will
say
straight
out
without
further
delay
that
liza
fell
passionately
in
love
with
the
prince
from
the
first
day
she
saw
him
and
the
prince
fell
in
love
with
her
too
partly
from
having
nothing
to
do
and
partly
from
a
propensity
for
turning
women
heads
and
also
owing
to
the
fact
that
liza
really
was
a
very
charming
creature
there
was
nothing
to
be
wondered
at
in
their
falling
in
love
with
each
other
he
had
certainly
never
expected
to
find
such
a
pearl
in
such
a
wretched
shell
i
am
alluding
to
the
town
of
o
and
she
had
never
in
her
wildest
dreams
seen
anything
in
the
least
like
this
brilliant
clever
fascinating
aristocrat
after
the
first
courtesies
ozhogin
introduced
me
to
the
prince
who
was
very
affable
in
his
behaviour
to
me
he
was
as
a
rule
very
affable
with
every
one
and
in
spite
of
the
immeasurable
distance
between
him
and
our
obscure
provincial
circle
he
was
clever
enough
to
avoid
being
a
source
of
constraint
to
any
one
and
even
to
make
a
show
of
being
on
our
level
and
only
living
at
petersburg
as
it
were
by
accident
that
first
evening
oh
that
first
evening
in
our
happy
days
of
childhood
our
teachers
used
to
describe
and
set
up
before
us
as
an
example
the
manly
fortitude
of
the
young
spartan
who
having
stolen
a
fox
and
hidden
it
under
his
tunic
without
uttering
one
shriek
let
it
devour
all
his
entrails
and
so
preferred
death
itself
to
disgrace
i
can
find
no
better
comparison
for
my
indescribable
sufferings
during
the
evening
on
which
i
first
saw
the
prince
by
liza
side
my
continual
forced
smile
and
painful
vigilance
my
idiotic
silence
my
miserable
and
ineffectual
desire
to
get
away
all
that
was
doubtless
something
truly
remarkable
in
its
own
way
it
was
not
one
wild
beast
alone
gnawing
at
my
vitals
jealousy
envy
the
sense
of
my
own
insignificance
and
helpless
hatred
were
torturing
me
i
could
not
but
admit
that
the
prince
really
was
a
very
agreeable
young
man
i
devoured
him
with
my
eyes
i
really
believe
i
forgot
to
blink
as
usual
as
i
stared
at
him
he
talked
not
to
liza
alone
but
all
he
said
was
of
course
really
for
her
he
must
have
felt
me
a
great
bore
he
most
likely
guessed
directly
that
it
was
a
discarded
lover
he
had
to
deal
with
but
from
sympathy
for
me
and
also
a
profound
sense
of
my
absolute
harmlessness
he
treated
me
with
extraordinary
gentleness
you
can
fancy
how
this
wounded
me
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
tried
i
remember
to
smooth
over
my
mistake
i
positively
do
laugh
at
me
whoever
you
may
be
who
chance
to
look
through
these
lines
especially
as
it
was
my
last
illusion
i
positively
in
the
midst
of
my
different
sufferings
imagined
all
of
a
sudden
that
liza
wanted
to
punish
me
for
my
haughty
coldness
at
the
beginning
of
my
visit
that
she
was
angry
with
me
and
only
flirting
with
the
prince
from
pique
i
seized
my
opportunity
and
with
a
meek
but
gracious
smile
i
went
up
to
her
and
muttered
forgive
me
not
that
i
afraid
and
suddenly
without
awaiting
her
reply
i
gave
my
features
an
extraordinarily
cheerful
and
expression
with
a
set
grin
passed
my
hand
above
my
head
in
the
direction
of
the
ceiling
i
wanted
i
remember
to
set
my
cravat
straight
and
was
even
on
the
point
of
pirouetting
round
on
one
foot
as
though
to
say
is
over
i
am
happy
let
all
be
happy
i
did
not
however
execute
this
manoeuvre
as
i
was
afraid
of
losing
my
balance
owing
to
an
unnatural
stiffness
in
my
knees
liza
failed
absolutely
to
understand
me
she
looked
in
my
face
with
amazement
gave
a
hasty
smile
as
though
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
as
quickly
as
possible
and
again
approached
the
prince
blind
and
deaf
as
i
was
i
could
not
but
be
inwardly
aware
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
angry
and
was
not
annoyed
with
me
at
that
instant
she
simply
never
gave
me
a
thought
the
blow
was
a
final
one
my
last
hopes
were
shattered
with
a
crash
just
as
a
block
of
ice
thawed
by
the
sunshine
of
spring
suddenly
falls
into
tiny
morsels
i
was
utterly
defeated
at
the
first
skirmish
and
like
the
prussians
at
jena
lost
everything
at
once
in
one
day
no
she
was
not
angry
with
me
alas
it
was
quite
the
contrary
she
too
i
saw
that
was
being
swept
off
her
feet
by
the
torrent
like
a
young
tree
already
half
torn
from
the
bank
she
bent
eagerly
over
the
stream
ready
to
abandon
to
it
for
ever
the
first
blossom
of
her
spring
and
her
whole
life
a
man
whose
fate
it
has
been
to
be
the
witness
of
such
a
passion
has
lived
through
bitter
moments
if
he
has
loved
himself
and
not
been
loved
i
shall
for
ever
remember
that
devouring
attention
that
tender
gaiety
that
innocent
that
glance
still
a
child
and
already
a
woman
that
happy
as
it
were
flowering
smile
that
never
left
the
lips
and
glowing
cheeks
all
that
liza
had
vaguely
foreshadowed
during
our
walk
in
the
wood
had
come
to
pass
now
and
she
as
she
gave
herself
up
utterly
to
love
was
at
once
stiller
and
brighter
like
new
wine
which
ceases
to
ferment
because
its
full
maturity
has
come
i
had
the
fortitude
to
sit
through
that
first
evening
and
the
subsequent
evenings
all
to
the
end
i
could
have
no
hope
of
anything
liza
and
the
prince
became
every
day
more
devoted
to
each
other
but
i
had
absolutely
lost
all
sense
of
personal
dignity
and
could
not
tear
myself
away
from
the
spectacle
of
my
own
misery
i
remember
one
day
i
tried
not
to
go
swore
to
myself
in
the
morning
that
i
would
stay
at
home
and
at
eight
in
the
evening
i
usually
set
off
at
seven
leaped
up
like
a
madman
put
on
my
hat
and
ran
breathless
into
kirilla
matveitch
my
position
was
excessively
absurd
i
was
obstinately
silent
sometimes
for
whole
days
together
i
did
not
utter
a
sound
i
was
as
i
have
said
already
never
distinguished
for
eloquence
but
now
everything
i
had
in
my
mind
took
flight
as
it
were
in
the
presence
of
the
prince
and
i
was
left
bare
and
bereft
besides
when
i
was
alone
i
set
my
wretched
brain
working
so
hard
slowly
going
over
everything
i
had
noticed
or
surmised
during
the
preceding
day
that
when
i
went
back
to
the
ozhogins
i
scarcely
had
energy
left
to
observe
again
they
treated
me
considerately
as
a
sick
person
i
saw
that
every
morning
i
adopted
some
new
final
resolution
for
the
most
part
painfully
hatched
in
the
course
of
a
sleepless
night
at
one
time
i
made
up
my
mind
to
have
it
out
with
liza
to
give
her
friendly
advice
but
when
i
chanced
to
be
alone
with
her
my
tongue
suddenly
ceased
to
work
froze
as
it
were
and
we
both
in
great
discomfort
waited
for
the
entrance
of
some
third
person
another
time
i
meant
to
run
away
of
course
for
ever
leaving
my
beloved
a
letter
full
of
reproaches
and
i
even
one
day
began
this
letter
but
the
sense
of
justice
had
not
yet
quite
vanished
in
me
i
realised
that
i
had
no
right
to
reproach
any
one
for
anything
and
i
flung
what
i
had
written
in
the
fire
then
i
suddenly
offered
myself
up
wholly
as
a
sacrifice
gave
liza
my
benediction
praying
for
her
happiness
and
smiled
in
meek
and
friendly
fashion
from
my
corner
at
the
prince
but
the
lovers
not
only
never
thanked
me
for
my
they
never
even
noticed
me
and
were
apparently
quite
ready
to
dispense
with
my
smiles
and
my
blessings
then
in
wrath
i
suddenly
flew
into
quite
the
opposite
mood
i
swore
to
myself
wrapping
my
cloak
about
me
like
a
spaniard
to
rush
out
from
some
dark
corner
and
stab
my
lucky
rival
and
with
brutal
glee
i
imagined
liza
despair
but
in
the
first
place
such
corners
were
few
in
the
town
of
o
and
secondly
the
wooden
fence
the
street
lamp
the
policeman
in
the
distance
no
in
such
corners
it
was
somehow
far
more
suitable
to
sell
buns
and
oranges
than
to
shed
human
blood
i
must
own
that
among
other
means
of
deliverance
as
i
very
vaguely
expressed
it
in
my
colloquies
with
myself
i
did
entertain
the
idea
of
having
recourse
to
ozhogin
himself
of
calling
the
attention
of
that
nobleman
to
the
perilous
situation
of
his
daughter
and
the
mournful
consequences
of
her
indiscretion
i
even
once
began
speaking
to
him
on
a
certain
delicate
subject
but
my
remarks
were
so
indirect
and
misty
that
after
listening
and
listening
to
me
he
suddenly
as
it
were
waking
up
rubbed
his
hand
rapidly
and
vigorously
all
over
his
face
not
sparing
his
nose
gave
a
snort
and
walked
away
from
me
it
is
needless
to
say
that
in
resolving
on
this
step
i
persuaded
myself
that
i
was
acting
from
the
most
disinterested
motives
was
desirous
of
the
general
welfare
and
was
doing
my
duty
as
a
friend
of
the
house
but
i
venture
to
think
that
even
had
kirilla
matveitch
not
cut
short
my
outpourings
i
should
in
any
case
not
have
had
courage
to
finish
my
monologue
at
times
i
set
to
work
with
all
the
solemnity
of
some
sage
of
antiquity
weighing
the
qualities
of
the
prince
at
times
i
comforted
myself
with
the
hope
that
it
was
all
of
no
consequence
that
liza
would
recover
her
senses
that
her
love
was
not
real
love
oh
no
in
short
i
know
no
idea
that
i
did
not
worry
myself
with
at
that
time
there
was
only
one
resource
which
never
i
candidly
admit
entered
my
head
i
never
once
thought
of
taking
my
life
why
it
did
not
occur
to
me
i
do
know
possibly
even
then
i
had
a
presentiment
i
should
not
have
long
to
live
in
any
case
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
in
such
unfavourable
circumstances
my
manner
my
behaviour
with
people
was
more
than
ever
marked
by
unnaturalness
and
constraint
even
madame
ozhogin
that
creature
from
her
birth
up
began
to
shun
me
and
at
times
did
not
know
in
what
way
to
approach
me
bizmyonkov
always
polite
and
ready
to
do
services
avoided
me
i
fancied
even
at
that
time
that
i
had
in
him
a
companion
in
misfortune
that
he
too
loved
liza
but
he
never
responded
to
my
hints
and
altogether
showed
a
reluctance
to
converse
with
me
the
prince
behaved
in
a
very
friendly
way
to
him
the
prince
one
might
say
respected
him
neither
bizmyonkov
nor
i
was
any
obstacle
to
the
prince
and
liza
but
he
did
not
shun
them
as
i
did
nor
look
savage
nor
injured
and
readily
joined
them
when
they
desired
it
it
is
true
that
on
such
occasions
he
was
not
conspicuous
for
any
special
mirthfulness
but
his
had
always
been
somewhat
subdued
in
character
in
this
fashion
about
a
fortnight
passed
by
the
prince
was
not
only
handsome
and
clever
he
played
the
piano
sang
sketched
fairly
well
and
was
a
good
hand
at
telling
stories
his
anecdotes
drawn
from
the
highest
circles
of
petersburg
society
always
made
a
great
impression
on
his
audience
all
the
more
so
from
the
fact
that
he
seemed
to
attach
no
importance
to
them
the
consequence
of
this
if
you
like
simple
accomplishment
of
the
prince
was
that
in
the
course
of
his
not
very
protracted
stay
in
the
town
of
o
he
completely
fascinated
all
the
neighbourhood
to
fascinate
us
poor
dwellers
in
the
steppes
is
at
all
times
a
very
easy
task
for
any
one
coming
from
higher
spheres
the
prince
frequent
visits
to
the
ozhogins
he
used
to
spend
his
evenings
there
of
course
aroused
the
jealousy
of
the
other
worthy
gentry
and
officials
of
the
town
but
the
prince
like
a
clever
person
and
a
man
of
the
world
never
neglected
a
single
one
of
them
he
called
on
all
of
them
to
every
married
lady
and
every
unmarried
miss
he
addressed
at
least
one
flattering
phrase
allowed
them
to
feed
him
on
elaborately
solid
edibles
and
to
make
him
drink
wretched
wines
with
magnificent
names
and
conducted
himself
in
short
like
a
model
of
caution
and
tact
prince
n
was
in
general
a
man
of
lively
manners
sociable
and
genial
by
inclination
and
in
this
case
incidentally
from
prudential
motives
also
he
could
not
fail
to
be
a
complete
success
in
everything
ever
since
his
arrival
all
in
the
house
had
felt
that
the
time
had
flown
by
with
unusual
rapidity
everything
had
gone
off
beautifully
papa
ozhogin
though
he
pretended
that
he
noticed
nothing
was
doubtless
rubbing
his
hands
in
private
at
the
idea
of
such
a
the
prince
for
his
part
managed
matters
with
the
utmost
sobriety
and
discretion
when
all
of
a
sudden
an
unexpected
incident
till
i
tired
these
recollections
irritate
me
even
at
the
edge
of
the
grave
terentyevna
noticed
that
my
nose
has
already
begun
to
grow
sharp
and
that
they
say
is
a
bad
sign
thaw
things
were
in
the
position
described
above
the
prince
and
liza
were
in
love
with
each
other
the
old
ozhogins
were
waiting
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
bizmyonkov
was
present
at
the
proceedings
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
said
of
him
i
was
struggling
like
a
fish
on
the
ice
and
watching
with
all
my
might
i
remember
that
at
that
time
i
set
myself
the
task
of
preventing
liza
at
least
from
falling
into
the
snares
of
a
seducer
and
consequently
began
paying
particular
attention
to
the
maidservants
and
the
fateful
stairs
though
on
the
other
hand
i
often
spent
whole
nights
in
dreaming
with
what
touching
magnanimity
i
would
one
day
hold
out
a
hand
to
the
betrayed
victim
and
say
to
her
traitor
has
deceived
thee
but
i
am
thy
true
friend
let
us
forget
the
past
and
be
happy
when
sudden
and
glad
tidings
overspread
the
whole
town
the
marshal
of
the
district
proposed
to
give
a
great
ball
in
honour
of
their
respected
guest
on
his
private
estate
gornostaevka
all
the
official
world
big
and
little
of
the
town
of
o
received
invitations
from
the
mayor
down
to
the
apothecary
an
excessively
emaciated
german
with
ferocious
pretensions
to
a
good
russian
accent
which
led
him
into
continually
and
quite
inappropriately
employing
racy
colloquialisms
tremendous
preparations
were
of
course
put
in
hand
one
purveyor
of
cosmetics
sold
sixteen
jars
of
pomatum
which
bore
the
inscription
la
the
young
ladies
provided
themselves
with
tight
dresses
agonising
in
the
waist
and
jutting
out
sharply
over
the
stomach
the
mammas
put
formidable
erections
on
their
heads
by
way
of
caps
the
busy
papas
were
half
dead
with
the
bustle
the
day
arrived
at
last
i
was
among
those
invited
from
the
town
to
gornostaevka
was
reckoned
between
seven
and
eight
miles
kirilla
matveitch
offered
me
a
seat
in
his
coach
but
i
refused
in
the
same
way
children
who
have
been
punished
wishing
to
pay
their
parents
out
refuse
their
favourite
dainties
at
table
besides
i
felt
that
my
presence
would
be
felt
as
a
constraint
by
liza
bizmyonkov
took
my
place
the
prince
drove
in
his
own
carriage
and
i
in
a
wretched
little
droshky
hired
for
an
immense
sum
for
this
solemn
occasion
i
am
not
going
to
describe
that
ball
everything
about
it
was
just
as
it
always
is
there
was
a
band
with
trumpets
extraordinarily
out
of
tune
in
the
gallery
there
were
country
gentlemen
greatly
flustered
with
their
inevitable
families
mauve
ices
viscous
lemonade
servants
in
boots
trodden
down
at
heel
and
knitted
cotton
gloves
provincial
lions
with
spasmodically
contorted
faces
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
all
this
little
world
was
revolving
round
its
sun
round
the
prince
lost
in
the
crowd
unnoticed
even
by
the
young
ladies
of
with
red
pimples
on
their
brows
and
blue
flowers
on
the
top
of
their
heads
i
stared
incessantly
first
at
the
prince
then
at
liza
she
was
very
charmingly
dressed
and
very
pretty
that
evening
they
only
twice
danced
together
it
is
true
he
danced
the
mazurka
with
her
but
it
seemed
to
me
at
least
that
there
was
a
sort
of
secret
continuous
communication
between
them
even
while
not
looking
at
her
while
not
speaking
to
her
he
was
still
as
it
were
addressing
her
and
her
alone
he
was
handsome
and
brilliant
and
charming
with
other
people
for
her
sake
only
she
was
apparently
conscious
that
she
was
the
queen
of
the
ball
and
that
she
was
loved
her
face
at
once
beamed
with
childlike
delight
and
innocent
pride
and
was
suddenly
illuminated
by
another
deeper
feeling
happiness
radiated
from
her
i
observed
all
this
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
watched
them
at
first
this
wounded
me
intensely
afterwards
it
as
it
were
touched
me
but
finally
it
infuriated
me
i
suddenly
felt
extraordinarily
wrathful
and
i
remember
was
extraordinarily
delighted
at
this
new
sensation
and
even
conceived
a
certain
respect
for
myself
show
them
we
not
crushed
yet
i
said
to
myself
when
the
first
inviting
notes
of
the
mazurka
sounded
i
looked
about
me
with
composure
and
with
a
cool
and
easy
air
approached
a
young
lady
with
a
red
and
shiny
nose
a
mouth
that
stood
awkwardly
open
as
though
it
had
come
unbuttoned
and
a
scraggy
neck
that
recalled
the
handle
of
a
i
went
up
to
her
and
with
a
perfunctory
scrape
of
my
heels
invited
her
to
the
dance
she
was
wearing
a
dress
of
faded
rosebud
pink
not
rose
colour
on
her
head
quivered
a
striped
and
dejected
beetle
of
some
sort
on
a
thick
bronze
pin
and
altogether
this
lady
was
if
one
may
so
express
it
soaked
through
and
through
with
a
sort
of
sour
ennui
and
inveterate
lack
of
success
from
the
very
commencement
of
the
evening
she
had
not
once
stirred
from
her
seat
no
one
had
thought
of
asking
her
to
dance
one
youth
of
sixteen
had
through
lack
of
a
partner
been
on
the
point
of
addressing
this
lady
and
had
taken
a
step
in
her
direction
but
had
thought
better
of
it
stared
at
her
and
hurriedly
dived
into
the
crowd
you
can
fancy
with
what
joyful
amazement
she
agreed
to
my
proposal
i
led
her
in
triumph
right
across
the
ballroom
picked
out
two
chairs
and
sat
down
with
her
in
the
ring
of
the
mazurka
among
ten
couples
almost
opposite
the
prince
who
had
of
course
been
offered
the
first
place
the
prince
as
i
have
said
already
was
dancing
with
liza
neither
i
nor
my
partner
was
disturbed
by
invitations
consequently
we
had
plenty
of
time
for
conversation
to
tell
the
truth
my
partner
was
not
conspicuous
for
her
capacity
for
the
utterance
of
words
in
consecutive
speech
she
used
her
mouth
principally
for
the
achievement
of
a
strange
downward
smile
such
as
i
had
never
till
then
beheld
while
she
raised
her
eyes
upward
as
though
some
unseen
force
were
pulling
her
face
in
two
but
i
did
not
feel
her
lack
of
eloquence
happily
i
felt
full
of
wrath
and
my
partner
did
not
make
me
shy
i
fell
to
finding
fault
with
everything
and
every
one
in
the
world
with
especial
emphasis
on
youngsters
and
petersburg
dandies
and
went
to
such
lengths
at
last
that
my
partner
gradually
ceased
smiling
and
instead
of
turning
her
eyes
upward
began
suddenly
from
astonishment
i
suppose
to
squint
and
that
so
strangely
as
though
she
had
for
the
first
time
observed
the
fact
that
she
had
a
nose
on
her
face
and
one
of
the
lions
referred
to
above
who
was
sitting
next
me
did
not
once
take
his
eyes
off
me
he
positively
turned
to
me
with
the
expression
of
an
actor
on
the
stage
who
has
waked
up
in
an
unfamiliar
place
as
though
he
would
say
it
really
you
while
i
poured
forth
this
tirade
i
still
however
kept
watch
on
the
prince
and
liza
they
were
continually
invited
but
i
suffered
less
when
they
were
both
dancing
and
even
when
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
and
smiling
as
they
talked
to
each
other
that
sweet
smile
which
hardly
leaves
the
faces
of
happy
lovers
even
then
i
was
not
in
such
torture
but
when
liza
flitted
across
the
room
with
some
desperate
dandy
of
an
hussar
while
the
prince
with
her
blue
gauze
scarf
on
his
knees
followed
her
dreamily
with
his
eyes
as
though
delighting
in
his
conquest
then
oh
then
i
went
through
intolerable
agonies
and
in
my
anger
gave
vent
to
such
spiteful
observations
that
the
pupils
of
my
partner
eyes
simply
fastened
on
her
nose
meanwhile
the
mazurka
was
drawing
to
a
close
they
were
beginning
the
figure
called
in
this
figure
the
lady
sits
in
the
middle
of
a
circle
chooses
another
lady
as
her
confidant
and
whispers
in
her
ear
the
name
of
the
gentleman
with
whom
she
wishes
to
dance
her
partner
conducts
one
after
another
of
the
dancers
to
her
but
the
lady
who
is
in
the
secret
refuses
them
till
at
last
the
happy
man
fixed
on
beforehand
arrives
liza
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
and
chose
the
daughter
of
the
host
one
of
those
young
ladies
of
whom
one
says
help
them
the
prince
proceeded
to
discover
her
choice
after
presenting
about
a
dozen
young
men
to
her
in
vain
the
daughter
of
the
house
refused
them
all
with
the
most
amiable
of
smiles
he
at
last
turned
to
me
something
extraordinary
took
place
within
me
at
that
instant
i
as
it
were
twitched
all
over
and
would
have
refused
but
got
up
and
went
along
the
prince
conducted
me
to
liza
she
did
not
even
look
at
me
the
daughter
of
the
house
shook
her
head
in
refusal
the
prince
turned
to
me
and
probably
incited
by
the
expression
of
my
face
made
me
a
deep
bow
this
sarcastic
bow
this
refusal
transmitted
to
me
through
my
triumphant
rival
his
careless
smile
liza
indifferent
inattention
all
this
lashed
me
to
frenzy
i
moved
up
to
the
prince
and
whispered
furiously
think
fit
to
laugh
at
me
it
seems
the
prince
looked
at
me
with
contemptuous
surprise
took
my
arm
again
and
making
a
show
of
me
to
my
seat
answered
coldly
you
i
went
on
in
a
whisper
obeying
however
that
is
to
say
following
him
to
my
place
but
i
do
not
intend
to
permit
any
petersburg
the
prince
smiled
tranquilly
almost
condescendingly
pressed
my
arm
whispered
understand
you
but
this
is
not
the
place
we
will
have
a
word
later
turned
away
from
me
went
up
to
bizmyonkov
and
led
him
up
to
liza
the
pale
little
official
turned
out
to
be
the
chosen
partner
liza
got
up
to
meet
him
sitting
beside
my
partner
with
the
dejected
beetle
on
her
head
i
felt
almost
a
hero
my
heart
beat
violently
my
breast
heaved
gallantly
under
my
starched
shirt
front
i
drew
deep
and
hurried
breaths
and
suddenly
gave
the
local
lion
near
me
such
a
magnificent
glare
that
there
was
an
involuntary
quiver
of
his
foot
in
my
direction
having
disposed
of
this
person
i
scanned
the
whole
circle
of
dancers
i
fancied
two
or
three
gentlemen
were
staring
at
me
with
some
perplexity
but
in
general
my
conversation
with
the
prince
had
passed
unnoticed
my
rival
was
already
back
in
his
chair
perfectly
composed
and
with
the
same
smile
on
his
face
bizmyonkov
led
liza
back
to
her
place
she
gave
him
a
friendly
bow
and
at
once
turned
to
the
prince
as
i
fancied
with
some
alarm
but
he
laughed
in
response
with
a
graceful
wave
of
his
hand
and
must
have
said
something
very
agreeable
to
her
for
she
flushed
with
delight
dropped
her
eyes
and
then
bent
them
with
affectionate
reproach
upon
him
the
heroic
frame
of
mind
which
had
suddenly
developed
in
me
had
not
disappeared
by
the
end
of
the
mazurka
but
i
did
not
indulge
in
any
more
epigrams
or
i
contented
myself
with
glancing
occasionally
with
gloomy
severity
at
my
partner
who
was
obviously
beginning
to
be
afraid
of
me
and
was
utterly
and
continuously
blinking
by
the
time
i
placed
her
under
the
protection
of
her
mother
a
very
fat
woman
with
a
red
cap
on
her
head
having
consigned
the
scared
maiden
lady
to
her
natural
belongings
i
turned
away
to
a
window
folded
my
arms
and
began
to
await
what
would
happen
i
had
rather
long
to
wait
the
prince
was
the
whole
time
surrounded
by
his
host
surrounded
simply
as
england
is
surrounded
by
the
sea
to
say
nothing
of
the
other
members
of
the
marshal
family
and
the
rest
of
the
guests
and
besides
he
could
hardly
go
up
to
such
an
insignificant
person
as
me
and
begin
to
talk
without
arousing
a
general
feeling
of
surprise
this
insignificance
i
remember
was
positively
a
joy
to
me
at
the
time
right
i
thought
as
i
watched
him
courteously
addressing
first
one
and
then
another
highly
respected
personage
honoured
by
his
notice
if
only
for
an
flash
as
the
poets
say
right
my
dear
you
come
to
me
soon
insulted
you
anyway
at
last
the
prince
adroitly
escaping
from
the
throng
of
his
adorers
passed
close
by
me
looked
somewhere
between
the
window
and
my
hair
was
turning
away
and
suddenly
stood
still
as
though
he
had
recollected
something
yes
he
said
turning
to
me
with
a
smile
the
way
i
have
a
little
matter
to
talk
to
you
about
two
country
gentlemen
of
the
most
persistent
who
were
obstinately
pursuing
the
prince
probably
imagined
the
matter
to
relate
to
official
business
and
respectfully
fell
back
the
prince
took
my
arm
and
led
me
apart
my
heart
was
thumping
at
my
ribs
i
believe
he
began
emphasising
the
word
and
looking
at
my
chin
with
a
contemptuous
expression
which
strange
to
say
was
supremely
becoming
to
his
fresh
and
handsome
face
said
something
abusive
to
me
said
what
i
thought
i
replied
raising
my
voice
quietly
he
observed
people
do
bawl
you
would
like
perhaps
to
fight
me
your
affair
i
answered
drawing
myself
up
shall
be
obliged
to
challenge
you
he
remarked
carelessly
you
do
withdraw
your
expressions
do
not
intend
to
withdraw
from
anything
i
rejoined
with
pride
he
observed
with
an
ironical
smile
that
case
he
continued
after
a
brief
pause
shall
have
the
honour
of
sending
my
second
to
you
good
said
in
a
voice
if
possible
even
more
indifferent
the
prince
gave
a
slight
bow
can
not
prevent
you
from
considering
me
he
added
with
a
haughty
droop
of
his
eyelids
the
princes
n
can
not
be
upstarts
till
we
meet
mr
mr
shtukaturin
he
quickly
turned
his
back
on
me
and
again
approached
his
host
who
was
already
beginning
to
get
excited
mr
shtukaturin
my
name
is
tchulkaturin
i
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
to
him
in
reply
to
this
last
insult
and
could
only
gaze
after
him
with
fury
i
muttered
clenching
my
teeth
and
i
at
once
looked
for
an
officer
of
my
acquaintance
a
cavalry
captain
in
the
uhlans
called
koloberdyaev
a
desperate
rake
and
a
very
good
fellow
to
him
i
related
in
few
words
my
quarrel
with
the
prince
and
asked
him
to
be
my
second
he
of
course
promptly
consented
and
i
went
home
i
could
not
sleep
all
night
from
excitement
not
from
cowardice
i
am
not
a
coward
i
positively
thought
very
little
of
the
possibility
confronting
me
of
losing
my
life
that
as
the
germans
assure
us
highest
good
on
earth
i
could
think
only
of
liza
of
my
ruined
hopes
of
what
i
ought
to
do
i
to
try
to
kill
the
prince
i
asked
myself
and
of
course
i
wanted
to
kill
him
not
from
revenge
but
from
a
desire
for
liza
good
she
will
not
survive
such
a
blow
i
went
on
better
let
him
kill
me
i
must
own
it
was
an
agreeable
reflection
too
that
i
an
obscure
provincial
person
had
forced
a
man
of
such
consequence
to
fight
a
duel
with
me
the
morning
light
found
me
still
absorbed
in
these
reflections
and
not
long
after
it
appeared
koloberdyaev
he
asked
me
entering
my
room
with
a
clatter
the
prince
second
my
word
i
answered
with
annoyance
seven
at
the
most
the
prince
is
still
asleep
i
should
imagine
that
case
replied
the
cavalry
officer
in
nowise
daunted
some
tea
for
me
my
head
aches
from
yesterday
evening
i
not
taken
my
clothes
off
all
night
though
indeed
he
added
with
a
yawn
do
as
a
rule
often
take
my
clothes
off
some
tea
was
given
him
he
drank
off
six
glasses
of
tea
and
rum
smoked
four
pipes
told
me
he
had
on
the
previous
day
bought
for
next
to
nothing
a
horse
the
coachman
refused
to
drive
and
that
he
was
meaning
to
drive
her
out
with
one
of
her
fore
legs
tied
up
and
fell
asleep
without
undressing
on
the
sofa
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
i
got
up
and
put
my
papers
to
rights
one
note
of
invitation
from
liza
the
one
note
i
had
received
from
her
i
was
on
the
point
of
putting
in
my
bosom
but
on
second
thoughts
i
flung
it
in
a
drawer
koloberdyaev
was
snoring
feebly
with
his
head
hanging
from
the
leather
pillow
for
a
long
while
i
remember
i
scrutinised
his
unkempt
daring
careless
and
face
at
ten
the
man
announced
the
arrival
of
bizmyonkov
the
prince
had
chosen
him
as
second
we
both
together
roused
the
soundly
sleeping
cavalry
officer
he
sat
up
stared
at
us
with
dim
eyes
in
a
hoarse
voice
demanded
vodka
he
recovered
himself
and
exchanging
greetings
with
bizmyonkov
he
went
with
him
into
the
next
room
to
arrange
matters
the
consultation
of
the
worthy
seconds
did
not
last
long
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
they
both
came
into
my
bedroom
koloberdyaev
announced
to
me
that
going
to
fight
at
three
with
pistols
in
silence
i
bent
my
head
in
token
of
my
agreement
bizmyonkov
at
once
took
leave
of
us
and
departed
he
was
rather
pale
and
inwardly
agitated
like
a
man
unused
to
such
jobs
but
he
was
nevertheless
very
polite
and
chilly
i
felt
as
it
were
in
his
presence
and
did
not
dare
look
him
in
the
face
koloberdyaev
began
telling
me
about
his
horse
this
conversation
was
very
welcome
to
me
i
was
afraid
he
would
mention
liza
but
the
cavalry
officer
was
not
a
gossip
and
moreover
he
despised
all
women
calling
them
god
knows
why
green
stuff
at
two
we
had
lunch
and
at
three
we
were
at
the
place
fixed
upon
the
very
birch
copse
in
which
i
had
once
walked
with
liza
a
couple
of
yards
from
the
precipice
we
arrived
first
but
the
prince
and
bizmyonkov
did
not
keep
us
long
waiting
the
prince
was
without
exaggeration
as
fresh
as
a
rose
his
brown
eyes
looked
out
with
excessive
cordiality
from
under
the
peak
of
his
cap
he
was
smoking
a
cigar
and
on
seeing
koloberdyaev
shook
his
hand
in
a
friendly
way
even
to
me
he
bowed
very
genially
i
was
conscious
on
the
contrary
of
being
pale
and
my
hands
to
my
terrible
vexation
were
slightly
trembling
my
throat
was
parched
i
had
never
fought
a
duel
before
god
i
thought
only
that
ironical
gentleman
take
my
agitation
for
timidity
i
was
inwardly
cursing
my
nerves
but
glancing
at
last
straight
in
the
prince
face
and
catching
on
his
lips
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
i
suddenly
felt
furious
again
and
was
at
once
at
my
ease
meanwhile
our
seconds
were
fixing
the
barrier
measuring
out
the
paces
loading
the
pistols
koloberdyaev
did
most
bizmyonkov
rather
watched
him
it
was
a
magnificent
day
as
fine
as
the
day
of
that
walk
the
thick
blue
of
the
sky
peeped
as
then
through
the
golden
green
of
the
leaves
their
lisping
seemed
to
mock
me
the
prince
went
on
smoking
his
cigar
leaning
with
his
shoulder
against
the
trunk
of
a
young
take
your
places
gentlemen
ready
koloberdyaev
pronounced
at
last
handing
us
pistols
the
prince
walked
a
few
steps
away
stood
still
and
turning
his
head
asked
me
over
his
shoulder
still
refuse
to
take
back
your
words
then
i
tried
to
answer
him
but
my
voice
failed
me
and
i
had
to
content
myself
with
a
contemptuous
wave
of
the
hand
the
prince
smiled
again
and
took
up
his
position
in
his
place
we
began
to
approach
one
another
i
raised
my
pistol
was
about
to
aim
at
my
enemy
chest
but
suddenly
tilted
it
up
as
though
some
one
had
given
my
elbow
a
shove
and
fired
the
prince
tottered
and
put
his
left
hand
to
his
left
temple
a
thread
of
blood
was
flowing
down
his
cheek
from
under
the
white
leather
glove
bizmyonkov
rushed
up
to
him
all
right
he
said
taking
off
his
cap
which
the
bullet
had
pierced
it
in
the
head
and
i
not
fallen
it
must
be
a
mere
scratch
he
calmly
pulled
a
cambric
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
and
put
it
to
his
curls
i
stared
at
him
as
though
i
were
turned
to
stone
and
did
not
stir
up
to
the
barrier
if
you
please
koloberdyaev
observed
severely
i
obeyed
the
duel
to
go
on
he
added
addressing
bizmyonkov
bizmyonkov
made
him
no
answer
but
the
prince
without
taking
the
handkerchief
from
the
wound
without
even
giving
himself
the
satisfaction
of
tormenting
me
at
the
barrier
replied
with
a
smile
duel
is
at
an
end
and
fired
into
the
air
i
was
almost
crying
with
rage
and
vexation
this
man
by
his
magnanimity
had
utterly
trampled
me
in
the
mud
he
had
completely
crushed
me
i
was
on
the
point
of
making
objections
on
the
point
of
demanding
that
he
should
fire
at
me
but
he
came
up
to
me
and
held
out
his
hand
all
forgotten
between
us
is
it
he
said
in
a
friendly
voice
i
looked
at
his
blanched
face
at
the
handkerchief
and
utterly
confounded
put
to
shame
and
annihilated
i
pressed
his
hand
he
added
turning
to
the
seconds
i
hope
will
be
kept
secret
course
cried
koloberdyaev
prince
allow
me
and
he
himself
bound
up
his
head
the
prince
as
he
went
away
bowed
to
me
once
more
but
bizmyonkov
did
not
even
glance
at
me
shattered
morally
shattered
went
homewards
with
koloberdyaev
what
the
matter
with
you
the
cavalry
captain
asked
me
your
mind
at
rest
the
wound
not
serious
he
be
able
to
dance
by
if
you
like
or
are
you
sorry
you
did
kill
him
wrong
if
you
are
he
a
fellow
business
had
he
to
spare
me
i
muttered
at
last
so
that
it
the
cavalry
captain
rejoined
tranquilly
you
writing
fellows
are
too
much
for
me
i
do
know
what
put
it
into
his
head
to
consider
me
an
author
i
absolutely
decline
to
describe
my
torments
during
the
evening
following
upon
that
luckless
duel
my
vanity
suffered
indescribably
it
was
not
my
conscience
that
tortured
me
the
consciousness
of
my
imbecility
crushed
me
have
given
myself
the
last
decisive
blow
by
my
own
act
i
kept
repeating
as
i
strode
up
and
down
my
room
prince
wounded
by
me
and
forgiving
me
yes
liza
is
now
his
now
nothing
can
save
her
nothing
can
hold
her
back
on
the
edge
of
the
abyss
i
knew
very
well
that
our
duel
could
not
be
kept
secret
in
spite
of
the
prince
words
in
any
case
it
could
not
remain
a
secret
for
liza
prince
is
not
such
a
fool
i
murmured
in
a
frenzy
of
rage
not
to
profit
by
but
meanwhile
i
was
mistaken
the
whole
town
knew
of
the
duel
and
of
its
real
cause
next
day
of
course
but
the
prince
had
not
blabbed
of
it
on
the
contrary
when
with
his
head
bandaged
and
an
explanation
ready
he
made
his
appearance
before
liza
she
had
already
heard
everything
whether
bizmyonkov
had
betrayed
me
or
the
news
had
reached
her
by
other
channels
i
can
not
say
though
indeed
can
anything
ever
be
concealed
in
a
little
town
you
can
fancy
how
liza
received
him
how
all
the
family
of
the
ozhogins
received
him
as
for
me
i
suddenly
became
an
object
of
universal
indignation
and
loathing
a
monster
a
jealous
bloodthirsty
madman
my
few
acquaintances
shunned
me
as
if
i
were
a
leper
the
authorities
of
the
town
promptly
addressed
the
prince
with
a
proposal
to
punish
me
in
a
severe
and
befitting
manner
nothing
but
the
persistent
and
urgent
entreaties
of
the
prince
himself
averted
the
calamity
that
menaced
me
that
man
was
fated
to
annihilate
me
in
every
way
by
his
generosity
he
had
shut
as
it
were
a
down
upon
me
it
needless
to
say
that
the
ozhogins
doors
were
at
once
closed
against
me
kirilla
matveitch
even
sent
me
back
a
bit
of
pencil
i
had
left
in
his
house
in
reality
he
of
all
people
had
no
reason
to
be
angry
with
me
my
that
was
the
expression
current
in
the
town
jealousy
had
pointed
out
defined
so
to
speak
the
relations
of
the
prince
to
liza
both
the
old
ozhogins
themselves
and
their
began
to
look
on
him
almost
as
betrothed
to
her
this
could
not
as
a
fact
have
been
quite
to
his
liking
but
he
was
greatly
attracted
by
liza
and
meanwhile
he
had
not
at
that
time
attained
his
aims
with
all
the
adroitness
of
a
clever
man
of
the
world
he
took
advantage
of
his
new
position
and
promptly
entered
as
they
say
into
the
spirit
of
his
new
part
but
i
for
myself
for
my
future
i
renounced
all
hopes
at
that
time
when
suffering
reaches
the
point
of
making
our
whole
being
creak
and
groan
like
an
overloaded
cart
it
ought
to
cease
to
be
ridiculous
but
no
laughter
not
only
accompanies
tears
to
the
end
to
exhaustion
to
the
impossibility
of
shedding
more
it
even
rings
and
echoes
where
the
tongue
is
dumb
and
complaint
itself
is
dead
and
so
as
in
the
first
place
i
do
intend
to
expose
myself
as
ridiculous
even
to
myself
and
secondly
as
i
am
fearfully
tired
i
will
put
off
the
continuation
and
please
god
the
conclusion
of
my
story
till
tomorrow
a
slight
frost
yesterday
it
was
yesterday
i
had
not
the
strength
to
go
on
with
my
diary
like
poprishtchin
i
lay
for
the
most
part
on
my
bed
and
talked
to
terentyevna
what
a
woman
sixty
years
ago
she
lost
her
first
betrothed
from
the
plague
she
has
outlived
all
her
children
she
is
inexcusably
old
drinks
tea
to
her
heart
desire
is
well
fed
and
warmly
clothed
and
what
do
you
suppose
she
was
talking
to
me
about
all
day
yesterday
i
had
sent
another
utterly
destitute
old
woman
the
collar
of
an
old
livery
half
to
put
on
her
vest
she
wears
strips
over
the
chest
by
way
of
vest
and
why
was
it
given
to
her
i
your
nurse
i
should
think
oh
oh
my
good
sir
it
too
bad
of
you
after
i
looked
after
you
as
i
have
and
so
on
the
merciless
old
woman
utterly
wore
me
out
with
her
reproaches
but
to
get
back
to
my
story
and
so
i
suffered
like
a
dog
whose
hindquarters
have
been
run
over
by
a
wheel
it
was
only
then
only
after
my
banishment
from
the
house
that
i
fully
realised
how
much
happiness
a
man
can
extract
from
the
contemplation
of
his
own
unhappiness
o
men
pitiful
race
indeed
but
away
with
philosophical
reflections
i
spent
my
days
in
complete
solitude
and
could
only
by
the
most
roundabout
and
even
humiliating
methods
find
out
what
was
passing
in
the
household
and
what
the
prince
was
doing
my
man
had
made
friends
with
the
cousin
of
the
latter
coachman
wife
this
acquaintance
afforded
me
some
slight
relief
and
my
man
soon
guessed
from
my
hints
and
little
presents
what
he
was
to
talk
about
to
his
master
when
he
pulled
his
boots
off
every
evening
sometimes
i
chanced
to
meet
some
one
of
the
ozhogins
family
bizmyonkov
or
the
prince
in
the
street
to
the
prince
and
to
bizmyonkov
i
bowed
but
i
did
not
enter
into
conversation
with
them
liza
i
only
saw
three
times
once
with
her
mamma
in
a
fashionable
shop
once
in
an
open
carriage
with
her
father
and
mother
and
the
prince
and
once
in
church
of
course
i
was
not
impudent
enough
to
approach
her
and
only
watched
her
from
a
distance
in
the
shop
she
was
very
much
preoccupied
but
cheerful
she
was
ordering
something
for
herself
and
busily
matching
ribbons
her
mother
was
gazing
at
her
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
and
her
nose
in
the
air
smiling
with
that
foolish
and
devoted
smile
which
is
only
permissible
in
adoring
mothers
in
the
carriage
with
the
prince
liza
was
i
shall
never
forget
that
meeting
the
old
people
were
sitting
in
the
back
seats
of
the
carriage
the
prince
and
liza
in
the
front
she
was
paler
than
usual
on
her
cheek
two
patches
of
pink
could
just
be
seen
she
was
half
facing
the
prince
leaning
on
her
straight
right
arm
in
the
left
hand
she
was
holding
a
sunshade
with
her
little
head
drooping
languidly
she
was
looking
straight
into
his
face
with
her
expressive
eyes
at
that
instant
she
surrendered
herself
utterly
to
him
intrusted
herself
to
him
for
ever
i
had
not
time
to
get
a
good
look
at
his
face
the
carriage
galloped
by
too
quickly
but
i
fancied
that
he
too
was
deeply
touched
the
third
time
i
saw
her
in
church
not
more
than
ten
days
had
passed
since
the
day
when
i
met
her
in
the
carriage
with
the
prince
not
more
than
three
weeks
since
the
day
of
my
duel
the
business
upon
which
the
prince
had
come
to
o
was
by
now
completed
but
he
still
kept
putting
off
his
departure
at
petersburg
he
was
reported
to
be
ill
in
the
town
it
was
expected
every
day
that
he
would
make
a
proposal
in
form
to
kirilla
matveitch
i
was
myself
only
awaiting
this
final
blow
to
go
away
for
ever
the
town
of
o
had
grown
hateful
to
me
i
could
not
stay
indoors
and
wandered
from
morning
to
night
about
the
suburbs
one
grey
gloomy
day
as
i
was
coming
back
from
a
walk
which
had
been
cut
short
by
the
rain
i
went
into
a
church
the
evening
service
had
only
just
begun
there
were
very
few
people
i
looked
round
me
and
suddenly
near
a
window
caught
sight
of
a
familiar
profile
for
the
first
instant
i
did
not
recognise
it
that
pale
face
that
spiritless
glance
those
sunken
cheeks
could
it
be
the
same
liza
i
had
seen
a
fortnight
before
wrapped
in
a
cloak
without
a
hat
on
with
the
cold
light
from
the
broad
white
window
falling
on
her
from
one
side
she
was
gazing
fixedly
at
the
holy
image
and
seemed
striving
to
pray
striving
to
awake
from
a
sort
of
listless
stupor
a
fat
little
page
with
yellow
trimmings
on
his
chest
was
standing
behind
her
and
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
stared
in
sleepy
bewilderment
at
his
mistress
i
trembled
all
over
was
about
to
go
up
to
her
but
stopped
short
i
felt
choked
by
a
torturing
presentiment
till
the
very
end
of
the
evening
service
liza
did
not
stir
all
the
people
went
out
a
beadle
began
sweeping
out
the
church
but
still
she
did
not
move
from
her
place
the
page
went
up
to
her
said
something
to
her
touched
her
dress
she
looked
round
passed
her
hand
over
her
face
and
went
away
i
followed
her
home
at
a
little
distance
and
then
returned
to
my
lodging
is
lost
i
cried
when
i
had
got
into
my
room
as
a
man
i
do
know
to
this
day
what
my
sensations
were
at
that
moment
i
flung
myself
i
remember
with
clasped
hands
on
the
sofa
and
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
floor
but
i
do
know
in
the
midst
of
my
woe
i
was
as
it
were
pleased
at
something
i
would
not
admit
this
for
anything
in
the
world
if
i
were
not
writing
only
for
myself
i
had
been
tormented
certainly
by
terrible
harassing
suspicions
and
who
knows
i
should
perhaps
have
been
greatly
disconcerted
if
they
had
not
been
fulfilled
is
the
heart
of
man
some
russian
teacher
would
exclaim
at
this
point
in
an
expressive
voice
while
he
raises
a
fat
forefinger
adorned
with
a
cornelian
ring
but
what
have
we
to
do
with
the
opinion
of
a
russian
teacher
with
an
expressive
voice
and
a
cornelian
on
his
finger
be
that
as
it
may
my
presentiment
turned
out
to
be
well
founded
suddenly
the
news
was
all
over
the
town
that
the
prince
had
gone
away
presumably
in
consequence
of
a
summons
from
petersburg
that
he
had
gone
away
without
making
any
proposal
to
kirilla
matveitch
or
his
wife
and
that
liza
would
have
to
deplore
his
treachery
till
the
end
of
her
days
the
prince
departure
was
utterly
unexpected
for
only
the
evening
before
his
coachman
so
my
man
assured
me
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
of
his
master
intentions
this
piece
of
news
threw
me
into
a
perfect
fever
i
at
once
dressed
and
was
on
the
point
of
hastening
to
the
ozhogins
but
on
thinking
the
matter
over
i
considered
it
more
seemly
to
wait
till
the
next
day
i
lost
nothing
however
by
remaining
at
home
the
same
evening
there
came
to
see
me
in
all
haste
a
certain
pandopipopulo
a
wandering
greek
stranded
by
some
chance
in
the
town
of
o
a
scandalmonger
of
the
first
magnitude
who
had
been
more
indignant
with
me
than
any
one
for
my
duel
with
the
prince
he
did
not
even
give
my
man
time
to
announce
him
he
fairly
burst
into
my
room
warmly
pressed
my
hand
begged
my
pardon
a
thousand
times
called
me
a
paragon
of
magnanimity
and
courage
painted
the
prince
in
the
darkest
colours
censured
the
old
ozhogins
who
in
his
opinion
had
been
punished
as
they
deserved
made
a
slighting
reference
to
liza
in
passing
and
hurried
off
again
kissing
me
on
my
shoulder
among
other
things
i
learned
from
him
that
the
prince
vrai
grand
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
in
response
to
a
delicate
hint
from
kirilla
matveitch
had
answered
coldly
that
he
had
no
intention
of
deceiving
any
one
and
no
idea
of
marrying
had
risen
made
his
bow
and
that
was
all
next
day
i
set
off
to
the
ozhogins
the
shortsighted
footman
leaped
up
from
his
bench
on
my
appearance
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
i
bade
him
announce
me
the
footman
hurried
away
and
returned
at
once
in
he
said
are
begged
to
go
in
i
went
into
kirilla
matveitch
study
the
rest
and
so
i
went
into
kirilla
matveitch
study
i
would
pay
any
one
handsomely
who
could
show
me
now
my
own
face
at
the
moment
when
that
highly
respected
official
hurriedly
flinging
together
his
approached
me
with
outstretched
arms
i
must
have
been
a
perfect
picture
of
modest
triumph
indulgent
sympathy
and
boundless
magnanimity
i
felt
myself
something
in
the
style
of
scipio
africanus
ozhogin
was
visibly
confused
and
cast
down
he
avoided
my
eyes
and
kept
fidgeting
about
i
noticed
too
that
he
spoke
unnaturally
loudly
and
in
general
expressed
himself
very
vaguely
vaguely
but
with
warmth
he
begged
my
forgiveness
vaguely
alluded
to
their
departed
guest
added
a
few
vague
generalities
about
deception
and
the
instability
of
earthly
blessings
and
suddenly
feeling
the
tears
in
his
eyes
hastened
to
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
probably
in
order
to
deceive
me
as
to
the
cause
of
his
tearfulness
he
used
the
russian
green
snuff
and
it
well
known
that
that
article
forces
even
old
men
to
shed
tears
that
make
the
human
eye
look
dull
and
senseless
for
several
minutes
i
behaved
of
course
very
cautiously
with
the
old
man
inquired
after
the
health
of
his
wife
and
daughter
and
at
once
artfully
turned
the
conversation
on
to
the
interesting
subject
of
the
rotation
of
crops
i
was
dressed
as
usual
but
the
feeling
of
gentle
propriety
and
soft
indulgence
which
filled
me
gave
me
a
fresh
and
festive
sensation
as
though
i
had
on
a
white
waistcoat
and
a
white
cravat
one
thing
agitated
me
the
thought
of
seeing
liza
ozhogin
at
last
proposed
of
his
own
accord
to
take
me
up
to
his
wife
the
but
foolish
woman
was
at
first
terribly
embarrassed
on
seeing
me
but
her
brain
was
not
capable
of
retaining
the
same
impression
for
long
and
so
she
was
soon
at
her
ease
at
last
i
saw
liza
she
came
into
the
room
i
had
expected
to
find
in
her
a
shamed
and
penitent
sinner
and
had
assumed
beforehand
the
most
affectionate
and
reassuring
expression
of
face
why
lie
about
it
i
really
loved
her
and
was
thirsting
for
the
happiness
of
forgiving
her
of
holding
out
a
hand
to
her
but
to
my
unutterable
astonishment
in
response
to
my
significant
bow
she
laughed
coldly
observed
carelessly
is
that
you
and
at
once
turned
away
from
me
it
is
true
that
her
laugh
struck
me
as
forced
and
in
any
case
did
not
accord
well
with
her
terribly
thin
face
but
all
the
same
i
had
not
expected
such
a
reception
i
looked
at
her
with
amazement
what
a
change
had
taken
place
in
her
between
the
child
she
had
been
and
the
woman
before
me
there
was
nothing
in
common
she
had
as
it
were
grown
up
straightened
out
all
the
features
of
her
face
especially
her
lips
seemed
defined
her
gaze
had
grown
deeper
harder
and
gloomier
i
stayed
on
at
the
till
she
got
up
went
out
of
the
room
and
came
back
again
answered
questions
with
composure
and
designedly
took
no
notice
of
me
she
wanted
i
saw
to
make
me
feel
that
i
was
not
worth
her
anger
though
i
had
been
within
an
ace
of
killing
her
lover
i
lost
patience
at
last
a
malicious
allusion
broke
from
my
lips
she
started
glanced
swiftly
at
me
got
up
and
going
to
the
window
pronounced
in
a
rather
shaky
voice
can
say
anything
you
like
but
let
me
tell
you
that
i
love
that
man
and
always
shall
love
him
and
do
not
consider
that
he
has
done
me
any
injury
quite
the
her
voice
broke
she
stopped
tried
to
control
herself
but
could
not
burst
into
tears
and
went
out
of
the
room
the
old
people
were
much
upset
i
pressed
the
hands
of
both
sighed
turned
my
eyes
heavenward
and
withdrew
i
am
too
weak
i
have
too
little
time
left
i
am
not
capable
of
describing
in
the
same
detail
the
new
range
of
torturing
reflections
firm
resolutions
and
all
the
other
fruits
of
what
is
called
inward
conflict
that
arose
within
me
after
the
renewal
of
my
acquaintance
with
the
ozhogins
i
did
not
doubt
that
liza
still
loved
and
would
long
love
the
prince
but
as
one
reconciled
to
the
inevitable
and
anxious
myself
to
conciliate
i
did
not
even
dream
of
her
love
i
desired
only
her
affection
i
desired
to
gain
her
confidence
her
respect
which
we
are
assured
by
persons
of
experience
forms
the
surest
basis
for
happiness
in
marriage
unluckily
i
lost
sight
of
one
rather
important
circumstance
which
was
that
liza
had
hated
me
ever
since
the
day
of
the
duel
i
found
this
out
too
late
i
began
as
before
to
be
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
house
of
the
ozhogins
kirilla
matveitch
received
me
with
more
effusiveness
and
affability
than
he
had
ever
done
i
have
even
ground
for
believing
that
he
would
at
that
time
have
cheerfully
given
me
his
daughter
though
i
was
certainly
not
a
match
to
be
coveted
public
opinion
was
very
severe
upon
him
and
liza
while
on
the
other
hand
it
extolled
me
to
the
skies
liza
attitude
to
me
was
unchanged
she
was
for
the
most
part
silent
obeyed
when
they
begged
her
to
eat
showed
no
outward
signs
of
sorrow
but
for
all
that
was
wasting
away
like
a
candle
i
must
do
kirilla
matveitch
the
justice
to
say
that
he
spared
her
in
every
way
old
madame
ozhogin
only
ruffled
up
her
feathers
like
a
hen
as
she
looked
at
her
poor
nestling
there
was
only
one
person
liza
did
not
shun
though
she
did
not
talk
much
even
to
him
and
that
was
bizmyonkov
the
old
people
were
rather
short
not
to
say
rude
in
their
behaviour
to
him
they
could
not
forgive
him
for
having
been
second
in
the
duel
but
he
went
on
going
to
see
them
as
though
he
did
not
notice
their
unamiability
with
me
he
was
very
chilly
and
strange
to
say
i
felt
as
it
were
afraid
of
him
this
state
of
things
went
on
for
a
fortnight
at
last
after
a
sleepless
night
i
resolved
to
have
it
out
with
liza
to
open
my
heart
to
her
to
tell
her
that
in
spite
of
the
past
in
spite
of
all
possible
gossip
and
scandal
i
should
consider
myself
only
too
happy
if
she
would
give
me
her
hand
and
restore
me
her
confidence
i
really
did
seriously
imagine
that
i
was
showing
what
they
call
in
the
school
an
unparalleled
example
of
magnanimity
and
that
from
sheer
amazement
alone
she
would
consent
in
any
case
i
resolved
to
have
an
explanation
and
to
escape
at
last
from
suspense
behind
the
ozhogins
house
was
a
rather
large
garden
which
ended
in
a
little
grove
of
neglected
and
overgrown
in
the
middle
of
this
thicket
stood
an
old
in
the
chinese
style
a
wooden
paling
separated
the
garden
from
a
blind
alley
liza
would
sometimes
walk
for
hours
together
alone
in
this
garden
kirilla
matveitch
was
aware
of
this
and
forbade
her
being
disturbed
or
followed
let
her
grief
wear
itself
out
he
said
when
she
could
not
be
found
indoors
they
had
only
to
ring
a
bell
on
the
steps
at
and
she
made
her
appearance
at
once
with
the
same
stubborn
silence
on
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
and
some
little
leaf
crushed
up
in
her
hand
so
noticing
one
day
that
she
was
not
in
the
house
i
made
a
show
of
going
away
took
leave
of
kirilla
matveitch
put
on
my
hat
and
went
out
from
the
hall
into
the
courtyard
and
from
the
courtyard
into
the
street
but
promptly
darted
in
at
the
gate
again
with
extraordinary
rapidity
and
hurried
past
the
kitchen
into
the
garden
luckily
no
one
noticed
me
without
losing
time
in
deliberation
i
went
with
rapid
steps
into
the
grove
in
a
little
path
before
me
was
standing
liza
my
heart
beat
violently
i
stood
still
drew
a
deep
sigh
and
was
just
on
the
point
of
going
up
to
her
when
suddenly
she
lifted
her
hand
without
turning
round
and
began
listening
from
behind
the
trees
in
the
direction
of
the
blind
alley
came
a
distinct
sound
of
two
knocks
as
though
some
one
were
tapping
at
the
paling
liza
clapped
her
hands
together
there
was
heard
the
faint
creak
of
the
gate
and
out
of
the
thicket
stepped
bizmyonkov
i
hastily
hid
behind
a
tree
liza
turned
towards
him
without
speaking
without
speaking
he
drew
her
arm
in
his
and
the
two
walked
slowly
along
the
path
together
i
looked
after
them
in
amazement
they
stopped
looked
round
disappeared
behind
the
bushes
reappeared
again
and
finally
went
into
the
this
was
a
diminutive
round
edifice
with
a
door
and
one
little
window
in
the
middle
stood
an
old
table
overgrown
with
fine
green
moss
two
discoloured
deal
benches
stood
along
the
sides
some
distance
from
the
damp
and
darkened
walls
here
on
exceptionally
hot
days
in
bygone
times
perhaps
once
a
year
or
so
they
had
drunk
tea
the
door
did
not
quite
shut
the
had
long
ago
come
out
of
the
window
and
hung
disconsolately
only
attached
at
one
corner
like
a
bird
broken
wing
i
stole
up
to
the
and
peeped
cautiously
through
the
chink
in
the
window
liza
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
benches
with
her
head
drooping
her
right
hand
lay
on
her
knees
the
left
bizmyonkov
was
holding
in
both
his
hands
he
was
looking
sympathetically
at
her
do
you
feel
he
asked
her
in
a
low
voice
the
same
she
answered
better
nor
the
emptiness
the
fearful
emptiness
she
added
raising
her
eyes
dejectedly
bizmyonkov
made
her
no
answer
do
you
think
she
went
on
he
write
to
me
once
more
do
think
so
lizaveta
kirillovna
she
was
silent
after
all
why
should
he
write
he
told
me
everything
in
his
first
letter
i
could
not
be
his
wife
but
i
have
been
happy
not
for
long
i
have
been
happy
bizmyonkov
looked
down
she
went
on
quickly
you
knew
how
i
loathe
that
tchulkaturin
i
always
fancy
i
see
on
that
man
hands
his
blood
i
shuddered
behind
my
chink
indeed
she
added
dreamily
knows
perhaps
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
duel
ah
when
i
saw
him
wounded
i
felt
at
once
that
i
was
altogether
his
loves
you
observed
bizmyonkov
is
that
to
me
i
do
want
any
one
she
stopped
and
added
slowly
yours
yes
my
friend
your
love
is
necessary
to
me
except
for
you
i
should
be
lost
you
have
helped
me
to
bear
terrible
moments
she
broke
off
bizmyonkov
began
with
fatherly
tenderness
stroking
her
hand
no
help
for
it
what
is
one
to
do
what
is
one
to
do
lizaveta
kirillovna
he
repeated
several
times
now
indeed
she
went
on
in
a
lifeless
voice
should
die
i
think
if
it
were
not
for
you
it
you
alone
that
keep
me
up
besides
you
remind
me
of
him
you
knew
all
about
it
you
see
do
you
remember
how
fine
he
was
that
day
but
forgive
me
it
must
be
hard
for
you
on
go
on
nonsense
bless
you
bizmyonkov
interrupted
her
she
pressed
his
hand
are
very
good
bizmyonkov
she
went
on
you
are
good
as
an
angel
what
can
i
do
i
feel
i
shall
love
him
to
the
grave
i
have
forgiven
him
i
am
grateful
to
him
god
give
him
happiness
may
god
give
him
a
wife
after
his
own
heart
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
only
he
does
not
forget
me
if
only
he
will
sometimes
think
of
his
liza
let
us
go
she
added
after
a
brief
silence
bizmyonkov
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
know
she
began
again
hotly
one
is
blaming
me
now
every
one
is
throwing
stones
at
me
let
them
i
would
any
way
change
my
misery
for
their
happiness
no
no
he
did
not
love
me
for
long
but
he
loved
me
he
never
deceived
me
he
never
told
me
i
should
be
his
wife
i
never
dreamed
of
it
myself
it
was
only
poor
papa
hoped
for
it
and
even
now
i
am
not
altogether
unhappy
the
memory
remains
to
me
and
however
fearful
the
results
i
stifling
here
it
was
here
i
saw
him
the
last
time
let
go
into
the
air
they
got
up
i
had
only
just
time
to
skip
on
one
side
and
hide
behind
a
thick
they
came
out
of
the
and
as
far
as
i
could
judge
by
the
sound
of
their
steps
went
away
into
the
thicket
i
do
know
how
long
i
went
on
standing
there
without
stirring
from
my
place
plunged
in
a
sort
of
senseless
amazement
when
suddenly
i
heard
steps
again
i
started
and
peeped
cautiously
out
from
my
bizmyonkov
and
liza
were
coming
back
along
the
same
path
both
were
greatly
agitated
especially
bizmyonkov
i
fancied
he
was
crying
liza
stopped
looked
at
him
and
distinctly
uttered
the
following
words
do
consent
bizmyonkov
i
would
never
have
agreed
if
you
were
only
trying
to
save
me
to
rescue
me
from
a
terrible
position
but
you
love
me
you
know
everything
and
you
love
me
i
shall
never
find
a
trustier
truer
friend
i
will
be
your
wife
bizmyonkov
kissed
her
hand
she
smiled
at
him
mournfully
and
moved
away
towards
the
house
bizmyonkov
rushed
into
the
thicket
and
i
went
my
way
seeing
that
bizmyonkov
had
apparently
said
to
liza
precisely
what
i
had
intended
to
say
to
her
and
she
had
given
him
precisely
the
reply
i
was
longing
to
hear
from
her
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
trouble
myself
further
within
a
fortnight
she
was
married
to
him
the
old
ozhogins
were
thankful
to
get
any
husband
for
her
now
tell
me
am
i
not
a
superfluous
man
did
i
play
throughout
the
whole
story
the
part
of
a
superfluous
person
the
prince
part
of
that
it
needless
to
speak
bizmyonkov
part
too
is
comprehensible
but
i
with
what
object
was
i
mixed
up
in
it
a
senseless
fifth
wheel
to
the
cart
ah
it
bitter
bitter
for
me
but
there
as
the
say
more
pull
and
one
more
yet
one
day
more
and
one
more
yet
and
there
will
be
no
more
bitter
nor
sweet
for
me
i
in
a
bad
way
i
am
writing
these
lines
in
bed
since
yesterday
evening
there
has
been
a
sudden
change
in
the
weather
is
hot
almost
a
summer
day
everything
is
thawing
breaking
up
flowing
away
the
air
is
full
of
the
smell
of
the
opened
earth
a
strong
heavy
stifling
smell
steam
is
rising
on
all
sides
the
sun
seems
beating
seems
smiting
everything
to
pieces
i
am
very
ill
i
feel
that
i
am
breaking
up
i
meant
to
write
my
diary
and
instead
of
that
what
have
i
done
i
have
related
one
incident
of
my
life
i
gossiped
on
slumbering
reminiscences
were
awakened
and
drew
me
away
i
have
written
without
haste
in
detail
as
though
i
had
years
before
me
and
here
now
there
no
time
to
go
on
death
death
is
coming
i
can
hear
her
menacing
the
time
is
come
the
time
is
come
and
indeed
what
does
it
matter
is
it
all
the
same
whatever
i
write
in
sight
of
death
the
last
earthly
cares
vanish
i
feel
i
have
grown
calm
i
am
becoming
simpler
clearer
too
late
i
gained
sense
it
a
strange
thing
i
have
grown
calm
certainly
and
at
the
same
time
i
full
of
dread
yes
i
full
of
dread
half
hanging
over
the
silent
yawning
abyss
i
shudder
turn
away
with
greedy
intentness
gaze
at
everything
about
me
every
object
is
doubly
precious
to
me
i
can
not
gaze
enough
at
my
poor
cheerless
room
saying
farewell
to
each
spot
on
my
walls
take
your
fill
for
the
last
time
my
eyes
life
is
retreating
slowly
and
smoothly
she
is
flying
away
from
me
as
the
shore
flies
from
the
eyes
of
one
at
sea
the
old
yellow
face
of
my
nurse
tied
up
in
a
dark
kerchief
the
hissing
samovar
on
the
table
the
pot
of
geranium
in
the
window
and
you
my
poor
dog
tresór
the
pen
i
write
these
lines
with
my
own
hand
i
see
you
now
here
you
are
here
is
it
possible
can
it
be
i
shall
never
see
you
again
it
hard
for
a
live
creature
to
part
with
life
why
do
you
fawn
on
me
poor
dog
why
do
you
come
putting
your
forepaws
on
the
bed
with
your
stump
of
a
tail
wagging
so
violently
and
your
kind
mournful
eyes
fixed
on
me
all
the
while
are
you
sorry
for
me
or
do
you
feel
already
that
your
master
will
soon
be
gone
ah
if
i
could
only
keep
my
thoughts
too
resting
on
all
the
objects
in
my
room
i
know
these
reminiscences
are
dismal
and
of
no
importance
but
i
have
no
other
emptiness
the
fearful
emptiness
as
liza
said
o
my
god
my
god
here
i
am
dying
a
heart
capable
of
loving
and
ready
to
love
will
soon
cease
to
beat
and
can
it
be
it
will
be
still
for
ever
without
having
once
known
happiness
without
having
once
expanded
under
the
sweet
burden
of
bliss
alas
it
impossible
impossible
i
know
if
only
now
at
least
before
death
for
death
after
all
is
a
sacred
thing
after
all
it
elevates
any
being
if
any
kind
sad
friendly
voice
would
sing
over
me
a
farewell
song
of
my
own
sorrow
i
could
perhaps
be
resigned
to
it
but
to
die
stupidly
stupidly
i
believe
i
beginning
to
rave
farewell
life
farewell
my
garden
and
you
my
when
the
summer
comes
do
not
forget
to
be
clothed
with
flowers
from
head
to
foot
and
may
it
be
sweet
for
people
to
lie
in
your
fragrant
shade
on
the
fresh
grass
among
the
whispering
chatter
of
your
leaves
lightly
stirred
by
the
wind
farewell
farewell
farewell
everything
and
for
ever
farewell
liza
i
wrote
those
two
words
and
almost
laughed
aloud
this
exclamation
strikes
me
as
taken
out
of
a
book
it
as
though
i
were
writing
a
sentimental
novel
and
ending
up
a
despairing
letter
is
the
first
of
april
can
i
be
going
to
die
that
would
be
really
too
unseemly
it
just
right
for
me
though
how
the
doctor
did
chatter
it
is
over
life
is
over
i
shall
certainly
die
it
hot
outside
almost
suffocating
or
is
it
that
my
lungs
are
already
refusing
to
breathe
my
little
comedy
is
played
out
the
curtain
is
falling
sinking
into
nothing
i
cease
to
be
superfluous
ah
how
brilliant
that
sun
is
those
mighty
beams
breathe
of
eternity
farewell
terentyevna
this
morning
as
she
sat
at
the
window
she
was
crying
perhaps
over
me
and
perhaps
because
she
too
will
soon
have
to
die
i
have
made
her
promise
not
to
kill
tresór
it
hard
for
me
to
write
i
will
put
down
the
pen
it
high
time
death
is
already
approaching
with
rumble
like
a
carriage
at
night
over
the
pavement
it
is
here
it
is
flitting
about
me
like
the
light
breath
which
made
the
prophet
hair
stand
up
on
end
i
am
dying
live
you
who
are
living
about
the
grave
may
youthful
life
rejoice
and
nature
heedless
glow
with
eternal
beauty
by
the
under
this
last
line
was
a
head
in
profile
with
a
big
streak
of
hair
and
moustaches
with
eyes
and
eyelashes
like
rays
and
under
the
head
some
one
had
written
the
following
words
manuscript
was
read
and
the
contents
of
it
not
approved
by
peter
zudotyeshin
my
my
my
my
dear
sir
peter
zudotyeshin
dear
sir
but
as
the
handwriting
of
these
lines
was
not
in
the
least
like
the
handwriting
in
which
the
other
part
of
the
manuscript
was
written
the
editor
considers
that
he
is
justified
in
concluding
that
the
above
lines
were
added
subsequently
by
another
person
especially
since
it
has
come
to
his
the
editor
knowledge
that
tchulkaturin
actually
did
die
on
the
night
between
the
and
of
april
in
the
year
at
his
native
place
sheep
springs
a
tour
in
the
forest
first
day
the
sight
of
the
vast
pinewood
embracing
the
whole
horizon
the
sight
of
the
recalls
the
sight
of
the
ocean
and
the
sensations
it
arouses
are
the
same
the
same
primaeval
untouched
force
lies
outstretched
in
its
breadth
and
majesty
before
the
eyes
of
the
spectator
from
the
heart
of
the
eternal
forest
from
the
undying
bosom
of
the
waters
comes
the
same
voice
have
nothing
to
do
with
thee
nature
says
to
man
reign
supreme
while
do
thou
bestir
thyself
to
thy
utmost
to
escape
dying
but
the
forest
is
gloomier
and
more
monotonous
than
the
sea
especially
the
pine
forest
which
is
always
alike
and
almost
soundless
the
ocean
menaces
and
caresses
it
frolics
with
every
colour
speaks
with
every
voice
it
reflects
the
sky
from
which
too
comes
the
breath
of
eternity
but
an
eternity
as
it
were
not
so
remote
from
us
the
dark
unchanging
keeps
sullen
silence
or
is
filled
with
a
dull
roar
and
at
the
sight
of
it
sinks
into
man
heart
more
deeply
more
irresistibly
the
sense
of
his
own
nothingness
it
is
hard
for
man
the
creature
of
a
day
born
yesterday
and
doomed
to
death
on
the
morrow
it
is
hard
for
him
to
bear
the
cold
gaze
of
the
eternal
isis
fixed
without
sympathy
upon
him
not
only
the
daring
hopes
and
dreams
of
youth
are
humbled
and
quenched
within
him
enfolded
by
the
icy
breath
of
the
elements
no
his
whole
soul
sinks
down
and
swoons
within
him
he
feels
that
the
last
of
his
kind
may
vanish
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
not
one
needle
will
quiver
on
those
twigs
he
feels
his
isolation
his
feebleness
his
fortuitousness
and
in
hurried
secret
panic
he
turns
to
the
petty
cares
and
labours
of
life
he
is
more
at
ease
in
that
world
he
has
himself
created
there
he
is
at
home
there
he
dares
yet
believe
in
his
own
importance
and
in
his
own
power
such
were
the
ideas
that
came
into
my
mind
some
years
ago
when
standing
on
the
steps
of
a
little
inn
on
the
bank
of
the
marshy
little
river
ressetta
i
first
gazed
upon
the
forest
the
bluish
masses
of
lay
in
long
continuous
ridges
before
me
here
and
there
was
the
green
patch
of
a
small
the
whole
was
hugged
by
the
nowhere
was
there
the
white
gleam
of
a
church
nor
bright
stretches
of
meadow
it
was
all
trees
and
trees
everywhere
the
ragged
edge
of
the
and
a
delicate
dim
mist
the
eternal
mist
of
the
forest
hung
over
them
in
the
distance
it
was
not
indolent
repose
this
immobility
of
life
suggested
no
the
absence
of
life
something
dead
even
in
its
grandeur
was
what
came
to
me
from
every
side
of
the
horizon
i
remember
big
white
clouds
were
swimming
by
slowly
and
very
high
up
and
the
hot
summer
day
lay
motionless
upon
the
silent
earth
the
reddish
water
of
the
stream
glided
without
a
splash
among
the
thick
reeds
at
its
bottom
could
be
dimly
discerned
round
cushions
of
pointed
moss
and
its
banks
sank
away
in
the
swampy
mud
and
sharply
reappeared
again
in
white
hillocks
of
fine
crumbling
sand
close
by
the
little
inn
ran
the
trodden
highroad
on
this
road
just
opposite
the
steps
stood
a
cart
loaded
with
boxes
and
hampers
its
owner
a
thin
pedlar
with
a
hawk
nose
and
eyes
bent
and
lame
was
putting
in
it
his
little
nag
lame
like
himself
he
was
a
who
was
making
his
way
to
the
fair
at
karatchev
suddenly
several
people
appeared
on
the
road
others
straggled
after
them
at
last
quite
a
crowd
came
trudging
into
sight
all
of
them
had
sticks
in
their
hands
and
satchels
on
their
shoulders
from
their
fatigued
yet
swinging
gait
and
from
their
faces
one
could
see
they
had
come
from
a
long
distance
they
were
leatherworkers
and
diggers
coming
back
from
working
for
hire
an
old
man
of
seventy
white
all
over
seemed
to
be
their
leader
from
time
to
time
he
turned
round
and
with
a
quiet
voice
urged
on
those
who
lagged
behind
now
now
lads
he
said
ow
they
all
walked
in
silence
in
a
sort
of
solemn
hush
only
one
of
them
a
little
man
with
a
wrathful
air
in
a
sheepskin
coat
wide
open
and
a
lambswool
cap
pulled
right
over
his
eyes
on
coming
up
to
the
gingerbread
man
suddenly
inquired
much
is
the
gingerbread
you
tomfool
sort
of
gingerbread
will
it
be
worthy
sir
the
disconcerted
gingerbread
man
responded
in
a
thin
little
voice
are
a
farthing
and
others
cost
a
halfpenny
have
you
a
halfpenny
in
your
purse
i
guess
it
will
sweeten
the
belly
too
much
retorted
the
sheepskin
and
he
retreated
from
the
cart
up
lads
hurry
up
i
heard
the
old
man
voice
far
yet
to
our
night
rest
uneducated
folk
said
the
with
a
squint
at
me
directly
all
the
crowd
had
trudged
past
such
a
dainty
for
the
likes
of
them
and
quickly
harnessing
his
horse
he
went
down
to
the
river
where
a
little
wooden
ferry
could
be
seen
a
peasant
in
a
white
felt
the
usual
headgear
in
the
forest
came
out
of
a
low
mud
hut
to
meet
him
and
ferried
him
over
to
the
opposite
bank
the
little
cart
with
one
wheel
creaking
from
time
to
time
crawled
along
the
trodden
and
deeply
rutted
road
i
fed
my
horses
and
i
too
was
ferried
over
after
struggling
for
a
couple
of
miles
through
the
boggy
prairie
i
got
at
last
on
to
a
narrow
raised
wooden
causeway
to
a
clearing
in
the
forest
the
cart
jolted
unevenly
over
the
round
beams
of
the
causeway
i
got
out
and
went
along
on
foot
the
horses
moved
in
step
snorting
and
shaking
their
heads
from
the
gnats
and
flies
the
forest
took
us
into
its
bosom
on
the
outskirts
nearer
to
the
prairie
grew
birches
aspens
limes
maples
and
oaks
then
they
met
us
more
rarely
the
dense
firwood
moved
down
on
us
in
an
unbroken
wall
further
on
were
the
red
bare
trunks
of
pines
and
then
again
a
stretch
of
mixed
copse
overgrown
with
underwood
of
hazelnut
mountain
ash
and
bramble
and
stout
vigorous
weeds
the
sun
rays
threw
a
brilliant
light
on
the
and
filtering
through
the
branches
here
and
there
reached
the
ground
in
pale
streaks
and
patches
birds
i
scarcely
heard
they
do
not
like
great
forests
only
from
time
to
time
there
came
the
doleful
call
of
a
hoopoe
and
the
angry
screech
of
a
nuthatch
or
a
jay
a
silent
always
solitary
bird
kept
fluttering
across
the
clearing
with
a
flash
of
golden
azure
from
its
lovely
feathers
at
times
the
trees
grew
further
apart
ahead
of
us
the
light
broke
in
the
cart
came
out
on
a
cleared
sandy
open
space
thin
rye
was
growing
over
it
in
rows
noiselessly
nodding
its
pale
ears
on
one
side
there
was
a
dark
dilapidated
little
chapel
with
a
slanting
cross
over
a
well
an
unseen
brook
was
babbling
peaceably
with
changing
ringing
sounds
as
though
it
were
flowing
into
an
empty
bottle
and
then
suddenly
the
road
was
cut
in
half
by
a
recently
fallen
and
the
forest
stood
around
so
old
lofty
and
slumbering
that
the
air
seemed
pent
in
in
places
the
clearing
lay
under
water
on
both
sides
stretched
a
forest
bog
all
green
and
dark
all
covered
with
reeds
and
tiny
alders
ducks
flew
up
in
pairs
and
it
was
strange
to
see
those
darting
rapidly
about
among
the
pines
ga
ga
ga
their
call
kept
rising
unexpectedly
then
a
shepherd
drove
a
flock
through
the
underwood
a
brown
cow
with
short
pointed
horns
broke
noisily
through
the
bushes
and
stood
stockstill
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
her
big
dark
eyes
fixed
on
the
dog
running
before
me
a
slight
breeze
brought
the
delicate
pungent
smell
of
burnt
wood
a
white
smoke
in
the
distance
crept
in
eddying
rings
over
the
pale
blue
forest
air
showing
that
a
peasant
was
for
a
or
for
a
foundry
the
further
we
went
on
the
darker
and
stiller
it
became
all
round
us
in
the
it
is
always
still
there
is
only
high
overhead
a
sort
of
prolonged
murmur
and
subdued
roar
in
the
one
goes
on
and
on
and
this
eternal
murmur
of
the
forest
never
ceases
and
the
heart
gradually
begins
to
sink
and
a
man
longs
to
come
out
quickly
into
the
open
into
the
daylight
he
longs
to
draw
a
full
breath
again
and
is
oppressed
by
the
fragrant
damp
and
decay
for
about
twelve
miles
we
drove
on
at
a
walking
pace
rarely
at
a
trot
i
wanted
to
get
by
daylight
to
svyatoe
a
hamlet
lying
in
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
twice
we
met
peasants
with
stripped
bark
or
long
logs
on
carts
it
far
to
svyatoe
i
asked
one
of
them
not
far
far
be
a
little
over
two
miles
another
hour
and
a
half
went
by
we
were
still
driving
on
and
on
again
we
heard
the
creak
of
a
laden
cart
a
peasant
was
walking
beside
it
far
brother
is
it
still
to
svyatoe
far
to
svyatoe
miles
the
sun
was
already
setting
when
at
last
i
got
out
of
the
forest
and
saw
facing
me
a
little
village
about
twenty
homesteads
were
grouped
close
about
an
old
wooden
church
with
a
single
green
cupola
and
tiny
windows
brilliantly
red
in
the
evening
glow
this
was
svyatoe
i
drove
into
its
outskirts
a
herd
returning
homewards
overtook
my
cart
and
with
lowing
grunting
and
bleating
moved
by
us
young
girls
and
bustling
peasant
women
came
to
meet
their
beasts
whiteheaded
boys
with
merry
shrieks
went
in
chase
of
refractory
pigs
the
dust
swirled
along
the
street
in
light
clouds
flushed
crimson
as
they
rose
higher
in
the
air
i
stopped
at
the
house
of
the
village
elder
a
crafty
and
clever
one
of
those
foresters
of
whom
they
say
he
can
see
two
yards
into
the
ground
early
next
morning
accompanied
by
the
village
elder
son
and
another
peasant
called
yegor
i
set
off
in
a
little
cart
with
a
pair
of
peasant
horses
to
shoot
woodcocks
and
moorhens
the
forest
formed
a
continuous
bluish
ring
all
round
the
there
was
reckoned
to
be
two
hundred
acres
no
more
of
ploughed
land
round
svyatoe
but
one
had
to
go
some
five
miles
to
find
good
places
for
game
the
elder
son
was
called
kondrat
he
was
a
young
fellow
with
a
peaceable
expression
of
face
obliging
and
talkative
he
drove
the
horses
yegor
sat
by
my
side
i
want
to
say
a
few
words
about
him
he
was
considered
the
cleverest
sportsman
in
the
whole
district
every
step
of
the
ground
for
fifty
miles
round
he
had
been
over
again
and
again
he
seldom
fired
at
a
bird
for
lack
of
powder
and
shot
but
it
was
enough
for
him
to
decoy
a
moorhen
or
to
detect
the
track
of
a
grouse
yegor
had
the
character
of
being
a
straightforward
fellow
and
talker
he
did
not
care
for
talking
and
never
exaggerated
the
number
of
birds
he
had
taken
a
trait
rare
in
a
sportsman
he
was
of
medium
height
thin
and
had
a
pale
long
face
and
big
honest
eyes
all
his
features
especially
his
straight
and
lips
were
expressive
of
untroubled
serenity
he
gave
a
slight
as
it
were
inward
smile
whenever
he
uttered
a
word
very
sweet
was
that
quiet
smile
he
never
drank
spirits
and
worked
industriously
but
nothing
prospered
with
him
his
wife
was
always
ailing
his
children
did
live
he
got
poorer
and
poorer
and
could
never
pick
up
again
and
there
is
no
denying
that
a
passion
for
the
chase
is
no
good
for
a
peasant
and
any
one
who
with
a
gun
is
sure
to
be
a
poor
manager
of
his
land
either
from
constantly
being
in
the
forest
face
to
face
with
the
stern
and
melancholy
scenery
of
that
inhuman
country
or
from
the
peculiar
cast
and
formation
of
his
character
there
was
noticeable
in
every
action
of
yegor
a
sort
of
modest
dignity
and
stateliness
stateliness
it
was
and
not
melancholy
the
stateliness
of
a
majestic
stag
he
had
in
his
time
killed
seven
bears
lying
in
wait
for
them
in
the
oats
the
last
he
had
only
succeeded
in
killing
on
the
fourth
night
of
his
ambush
the
bear
persisted
in
not
turning
sideways
to
him
and
he
had
only
one
bullet
yegor
had
killed
him
the
day
before
my
arrival
when
kondrat
brought
me
to
him
i
found
him
in
his
back
yard
squatting
on
his
heels
before
the
huge
beast
he
was
cutting
the
fat
out
with
a
short
blunt
knife
a
fine
fellow
you
knocked
over
there
i
observed
yegor
raised
his
head
and
looked
first
at
me
then
at
the
dog
who
had
come
with
me
it
shooting
you
come
after
sir
there
are
woodcocks
at
moshnoy
three
coveys
and
five
of
moorhens
he
observed
and
set
to
work
again
with
yegor
and
with
kondrat
i
went
out
the
next
day
in
search
of
sport
we
drove
rapidly
over
the
open
ground
surrounding
svyatoe
but
when
we
got
into
the
forest
we
crawled
along
at
a
walking
pace
once
more
there
a
said
kondrat
suddenly
turning
to
me
knock
it
over
yegor
looked
in
the
direction
kondrat
pointed
but
said
nothing
the
was
over
a
hundred
paces
from
us
and
one
ca
kill
it
at
forty
paces
there
is
such
strength
in
its
feathers
a
few
more
remarks
were
made
by
the
conversational
kondrat
but
the
forest
hush
had
its
influence
even
on
him
he
became
silent
only
rarely
exchanging
a
word
or
two
looking
straight
ahead
and
listening
to
the
puffing
and
snorting
of
the
horses
we
got
at
last
to
that
is
the
name
given
to
the
older
overgrown
in
places
by
fir
saplings
we
got
out
kondrat
led
the
cart
into
the
bushes
so
that
the
gnats
should
not
bite
the
horses
yegor
examined
the
cock
of
his
gun
and
crossed
himself
he
never
began
anything
without
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
forest
into
which
we
had
come
was
exceedingly
old
i
do
know
whether
the
tartars
had
wandered
over
it
but
russian
thieves
or
lithuanians
in
disturbed
times
might
certainly
have
hidden
in
its
recesses
at
a
respectful
distance
from
one
another
stood
the
mighty
pines
with
their
slightly
curved
massive
trunks
between
them
stood
in
single
file
others
rather
younger
the
ground
was
covered
with
greenish
moss
sprinkled
all
over
with
dead
blueberries
grew
in
dense
bushes
the
strong
perfume
of
the
berries
like
the
smell
of
musk
oppressed
the
breathing
the
sun
could
not
pierce
through
the
high
network
of
the
but
it
was
stiflingly
hot
in
the
forest
all
the
same
and
not
dark
like
big
drops
of
sweat
the
heavy
transparent
resin
stood
out
and
slowly
trickled
down
the
coarse
bark
of
the
trees
the
still
air
with
no
light
or
shade
in
it
stung
the
face
everything
was
silent
even
our
footsteps
were
not
audible
we
walked
on
the
moss
as
on
a
carpet
yegor
in
particular
moved
as
silently
as
a
shadow
even
the
brushwood
did
not
crackle
under
his
feet
he
walked
without
haste
from
time
to
time
blowing
a
shrill
note
on
a
whistle
a
woodcock
soon
answered
back
and
before
my
eyes
darted
into
a
thick
but
in
vain
yegor
pointed
him
out
to
me
however
much
i
strained
my
eyes
i
could
not
make
him
out
yegor
had
to
take
a
shot
at
him
we
came
upon
two
coveys
of
moorhens
also
the
cautious
birds
rose
at
a
distance
with
an
abrupt
heavy
sound
we
succeeded
however
in
killing
three
young
ones
at
one
footnote
is
the
name
given
to
a
place
where
tar
has
been
author
note
yegor
suddenly
stopped
and
called
me
up
bear
has
been
trying
to
get
water
he
observed
pointing
to
a
broad
fresh
scratch
made
in
the
very
middle
of
a
hole
covered
with
fine
moss
that
the
print
of
his
paw
i
inquired
but
the
water
has
dried
up
that
the
track
of
him
too
on
that
pine
he
has
been
climbing
after
honey
he
has
cut
into
it
with
his
claws
as
if
with
a
knife
we
went
on
making
our
way
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
yegor
only
rarely
looked
upwards
and
walked
on
serenely
and
confidently
i
saw
a
high
round
rampart
enclosed
by
a
ditch
that
a
too
i
inquired
answered
yegor
where
the
thieves
town
stood
ago
ago
our
grandfathers
remember
it
here
they
buried
their
treasure
and
they
took
a
mighty
oath
on
human
blood
we
went
on
another
mile
and
a
half
i
began
to
feel
thirsty
down
a
little
while
said
yegor
will
go
for
water
there
is
a
well
not
far
from
here
he
went
away
i
was
left
alone
i
sat
down
on
a
felled
stump
leaned
my
elbows
on
my
knees
and
after
a
long
stillness
raised
my
head
and
looked
around
me
oh
how
still
and
sullenly
gloomy
was
everything
around
me
no
not
gloomy
even
but
dumb
cold
and
menacing
at
the
same
time
my
heart
sank
at
that
instant
at
that
spot
i
had
a
sense
of
death
breathing
upon
me
i
felt
i
almost
touched
its
perpetual
closeness
if
only
one
sound
had
vibrated
one
momentary
rustle
had
arisen
in
the
engulfing
stillness
of
the
that
hemmed
me
in
on
all
sides
i
let
my
head
sink
again
almost
in
terror
it
was
as
though
i
had
looked
in
where
no
man
ought
to
look
i
put
my
hand
over
my
eyes
and
all
at
once
as
though
at
some
mysterious
bidding
i
began
to
remember
all
my
life
there
passed
in
a
flash
before
me
my
childhood
noisy
and
peaceful
quarrelsome
and
with
hurried
joys
and
swift
sorrows
then
my
youth
rose
up
vague
queer
with
all
its
mistakes
and
beginnings
with
disconnected
work
and
agitated
indolence
there
came
back
too
to
my
memory
the
comrades
who
shared
those
early
aspirations
then
like
lightning
in
the
night
there
came
the
gleam
of
a
few
bright
memories
then
the
shadows
began
to
grow
and
bear
down
on
me
it
was
darker
and
darker
about
me
more
dully
and
quietly
the
monotonous
years
ran
by
and
like
a
stone
dejection
sank
upon
my
heart
i
sat
without
stirring
and
gazed
gazed
with
effort
and
perplexity
as
though
i
saw
all
my
life
before
me
as
though
scales
had
fallen
from
my
eyes
oh
what
have
i
done
my
lips
involuntarily
murmured
in
a
bitter
whisper
o
life
life
where
how
have
you
gone
without
a
trace
how
have
you
slipped
through
my
clenched
fingers
have
you
deceived
me
or
was
it
that
i
knew
not
how
to
make
use
of
your
gifts
is
it
possible
is
this
fragment
this
poor
handful
of
dusty
ashes
all
that
is
left
of
you
is
this
cold
stagnant
unnecessary
something
i
the
i
of
old
days
how
the
soul
was
athirst
for
happiness
so
perfect
she
rejected
with
such
scorn
all
that
was
small
all
that
was
insufficient
she
waited
soon
happiness
would
burst
on
her
in
a
torrent
and
has
not
one
drop
moistened
the
parched
lips
oh
my
golden
strings
you
that
once
so
delicately
so
sweetly
quivered
i
have
never
it
seems
heard
your
music
you
had
but
just
sounded
when
you
broke
or
perhaps
happiness
the
true
happiness
of
all
my
life
passed
close
by
me
smiled
a
resplendent
smile
upon
me
and
i
failed
to
recognise
its
divine
countenance
or
did
it
really
visit
me
sit
at
my
bedside
and
is
forgotten
by
me
like
a
dream
like
a
dream
i
repeated
disconsolately
elusive
images
flitted
over
my
soul
awakening
in
it
something
between
pity
and
bewilderment
you
too
i
thought
dear
familiar
lost
faces
you
thronging
about
me
in
this
deadly
solitude
why
are
you
so
profoundly
and
mournfully
silent
from
what
abyss
have
you
arisen
how
am
i
to
interpret
your
enigmatic
glances
are
you
greeting
me
or
bidding
me
farewell
oh
can
it
be
there
is
no
hope
no
turning
back
why
are
these
heavy
belated
drops
trickling
from
my
eyes
o
heart
why
to
what
end
grieve
more
try
to
forget
if
you
would
have
peace
harden
yourself
to
the
meek
acceptance
of
the
last
parting
to
the
bitter
words
and
ever
do
not
look
back
do
not
remember
do
not
strive
to
reach
where
it
is
light
where
youth
laughs
where
hope
is
wreathed
with
the
flowers
of
spring
where
dovelike
delight
soars
on
azure
wings
where
love
like
dew
in
the
sunrise
flashes
with
tears
of
ecstasy
look
not
where
is
bliss
and
faith
and
power
that
is
not
our
place
is
water
for
you
i
heard
yegor
musical
voice
behind
me
with
god
blessing
i
could
not
help
starting
this
living
speech
shook
me
sent
a
delightful
tremor
all
through
me
it
was
as
though
i
had
fallen
into
unknown
dark
depths
where
all
was
hushed
about
me
and
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
soft
persistent
moan
of
some
unending
grief
i
was
faint
and
could
not
struggle
and
all
at
once
there
floated
down
to
me
a
friendly
voice
and
some
mighty
hand
with
one
pull
drew
me
up
into
the
light
of
day
i
looked
round
and
with
unutterable
consolation
saw
the
serene
and
honest
face
of
my
guide
he
stood
easily
and
gracefully
before
me
and
with
his
habitual
smile
held
out
a
wet
flask
full
of
clear
liquid
i
got
up
go
on
lead
the
way
i
said
eagerly
we
set
off
and
wandered
a
long
while
till
evening
directly
the
noonday
heat
was
over
it
became
cold
and
dark
so
rapidly
in
the
forest
that
one
felt
no
desire
to
remain
in
it
restless
mortals
it
seemed
whispering
sullenly
from
each
pine
we
came
out
but
it
was
some
time
before
we
could
find
kondrat
we
shouted
called
to
him
but
he
did
not
answer
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
profound
stillness
of
the
air
we
heard
his
wo
sound
distinctly
in
a
ravine
close
to
us
the
wind
which
had
suddenly
sprung
up
and
as
suddenly
dropped
again
had
prevented
him
from
hearing
our
calls
only
on
the
trees
which
stood
some
distance
apart
were
traces
of
its
onslaught
to
be
seen
many
of
the
leaves
were
blown
inside
out
and
remained
so
giving
a
variegated
look
to
the
motionless
foliage
we
got
into
the
cart
and
drove
home
i
sat
swaying
to
and
fro
and
slowly
breathing
in
the
damp
rather
keen
air
and
all
my
recent
reveries
and
regrets
were
drowned
in
the
one
sensation
of
drowsiness
and
fatigue
in
the
one
desire
to
get
back
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
shelter
of
a
warm
house
to
have
a
good
drink
of
tea
with
cream
to
nestle
into
the
soft
yielding
hay
and
to
sleep
to
sleep
to
sleep
second
day
the
next
morning
the
three
of
us
set
off
to
the
wood
ten
years
before
several
thousand
acres
in
the
had
been
burnt
down
and
had
not
up
to
that
time
grown
again
here
and
there
young
firs
and
pines
were
shooting
up
but
for
the
most
part
there
was
nothing
but
moss
and
ashes
in
this
wood
which
is
reckoned
to
be
about
nine
miles
from
svyatoe
there
are
all
sorts
of
berries
growing
in
great
profusion
and
it
is
a
favourite
haunt
of
grouse
who
are
very
fond
of
strawberries
and
bilberries
we
were
driving
along
in
silence
when
suddenly
kondrat
raised
his
head
he
exclaimed
that
never
efrem
standing
yonder
to
you

he
added
raising
his
voice
and
lifting
his
cap
a
short
peasant
in
a
short
black
smock
with
a
cord
round
the
waist
came
out
from
behind
a
tree
and
approached
the
cart
have
they
let
you
off
inquired

replied
the
peasant
and
he
grinned

the
peasant
suddenly
inquired

his
little
eyes
rapidly
upon

kondrat

little
blue
eyes
positively
danced
like

stood
in

his
physiognomy

by
his
nose
kondrat
often
used
to
drive
with
gentlemen
and
had
been
in
the
chief
town
of
the
province
and
so
liked
on
occasion
to
show
off
his
attainments
positively

how
many
times
taken

upon
my
soul

used
to
it
from
childhood

for
him
there
last
summer
he
came
at
night
straight
across
from
altuhin
to
svyatoe
and
no
one
had
ever
been
known
to
walk
it
it
be
over
thirty
miles
and
he
steals
honey
too
no
one
can
beat
him
at
that
and
the
bees
do
sting
him
there
not
a
hive
he
has
plundered
expect
he
does
spare
the
wild
bees
either
no
i
wo
lay
a
false
charge
against
him
that
sin
never
been
observed
in
him
the
wild
bees
nest
is
a
holy
thing
with
us
a
hive
is
shut
in
by
fences
there
a
watch
kept
if
you
get
the
honey
it
your
luck
but
the
wild
bee
is
a
thing
of
god
not
guarded
only
the
bear
touches
it
he
is
a
bear
remarked
yegor
he
married
be
sure
and
he
has
a
son
and
wo
he
be
a
thief
too
the
son

taken
after
his
father
and
he
training
him
now
too
the
other
day
he
took
a
pot
with
some
old
coppers
in
it
stolen
somewhere
no
doubt
went
and
buried
it
in
a
clearing
in
the
forest
and
went
home
and
sent
his
son
to
the
clearing
till
you
find
the
pot
says
he
i
wo
give
you
anything
to
eat
or
let
you
into
the
place
the
son
stayed
the
whole
day
in
the
forest
and
spent
the
night
there
but
he
found
the
pot
yes
he
a
smart
chap
that
efrem
when
he
at
home

a
civil
fellow
presses
every
one
you
may
eat
and
drink
as
you
will
and
there
be
dancing

up
at
his
place
and
of
all
sorts
and
when
he
comes
to
the
meeting
we
have
a
parish
meeting
you
know
in
our
village
well
no
one
talks
better
sense
than
he
does
he
come
up
behind
listen
say
a
word
as
if
he
chopped
it
off
and
away
again
and
a
weighty
word
it
be
too
but
when
he
about
in
the
forest
ah
that
means
trouble
we
to
look
out
for
mischief
though
i
must
say
he
does
touch
his
own
people
unless
he
in
a
fix
if
he
meets
a
svyatoe
man
go
along
with
you

a
long
way
away
the
forest
devil
upon
me

bad
business
can

all
be
thinking
about
a
whole
district
ca
get
even
with
one
man
that
just
how
it
is
any
way
he
a
sorcerer
then
can
say
here
some
days
ago
he
crept
round
at
night
to
the
deacon
near
after
the
honey
and
the
deacon
was
watching
the
hive
himself
well
he
caught
him
and
in
the
dark
he
gave
him
a
good
hiding
when
he
done
efrem
he
says
to
him
but
know
who
it
is
you
been
beating
the
deacon
when
he
knew
him
by
his
voice
was
fairly
dumfoundered
well
my
good
friend
says
efrem
you
wo
get
off
so
easily
for
this
the
deacon
fell
down
at
his
feet
take
says
he
what
you
please
no
says
he
i
take
it
from
you
at
my
own
time
and
as
i
choose
and
what
do
you
think
since
that
day
the
deacon
as
though
he
been
scalded
he
wanders
about
like
a
ghost
it
taken
says
he
all
the
heart
out
of
me
it
was
a
dreadful
powerful
saying
to
be
sure
the
brigand
fastened
upon
me
that
how
it
is
with
him
with
the
deacon
deacon
must
be
a
fool
i
observed
fool
well
but
what
do
you
say
to
this
there
was
once
an
order
issued
to
seize
this
fellow
efrem
we
had
a
police
commissary
then
a
sharp
man
and
so
a
dozen
chaps
went
off
into
the
forest
to
take
efrem
they
look
and
there
he
is
coming
to
meet
them
one
of
them
shouts
here
he
is
hold
him
tie
him
but
efrem
stepped
into
the
forest
and
cut
himself
a
branch
two
fingers
thickness
like
this
and
then
out
he
skips
into
the
road
again
looking
so
frightful
so
terrible
and
gives
the
command
like
a
general
at
a
review
on
your
knees
all
of
them
fairly
fell
down
but
who
says
he
shouted
hold
him
tie
him
you
seryoga
the
fellow
simply
jumped
up
and
ran
and
efrem
after
him
and
kept
swinging
his
branch
at
his
heels
for
nearly
a
mile
he
stroked
him
down
and
afterwards
he
never
ceased
to
regret
ah
say
it
is
annoying
i
did
lay
him
up
for
the
confession
for
it
was
just
before
philip
day
well
they
changed
the
police
commissary
soon
after
but
it
all
ended
the
same
way
did
they
all
give
in
to
him
well
it
is
so
has
frightened
you
all
and
now
he
does
as
he
likes
with
you
yes
he
frighten
any
one
and
he
a
wonderful
hand
at
contrivances
my
goodness
yes
i
once
came
upon
him
in
the
forest
there
was
a
heavy
rain
falling
i
was
for
edging
away
but
he
looked
at
me
and
beckoned
to
me
with
his
hand
like
this
come
along
says
he
kondrat
do
be
afraid
let
me
show
you
how
to
live
in
the
forest
and
to
keep
dry
in
the
rain
i
went
up
to
him
and
he
was
sitting
under
a
and
he
made
a
fire
of
damp
twigs
the
smoke
hung
about
in
the
and
kept
the
rain
from
dripping
through
i
was
astonished
at
him
then
and
i
tell
you
what
he
contrived
one
time
and
kondrat
laughed
really
did
do
a
funny
thing
been
thrashing
the
oats
at
the
and
they
finished
they
had
time
to
rake
up
the
last
heap
well
they
set
two
by
it
for
the
night
and
they
were
the
of
the
chaps
either
well
they
were
sitting
and
gossiping
and
efrem
takes
and
stuffs
his
full
of
straw
ties
up
the
and
puts
the
shirt
up
over
his
head
and
so
he
steals
up
in
that
shape
to
the
and
just
pops
out
from
behind
the
corner
and
gives
them
a
peep
of
his
horns
one
chap
says
to
the
other
do
you
see
yes
says
the
other
and
did
he
give
a
screech
all
of
a
sudden
and
then
the
fences
creaked
and
nothing
more
was
seen
of
them
efrem
shovelled
up
the
oats
into
a
bag
and
dragged
it
off
home
he
told
the
story
himself
afterwards
he
put
them
to
shame
he
did
the
chaps
he
did
really
kondrat
laughed
again
and
yegor
smiled
the
fences
creaked
and
that
was
all
he
commented
was
nothing
more
seen
of
them
kondrat
assented
were
simply
gone
in
a
flash
we
were
all
silent
again
suddenly
kondrat
started
and
sat
up
mercy
upon
us
he
ejaculated
it
never
a
fire
where
we
asked
see
in
front
where
we
going
a
fire
it
is
efrem
there
efrem
why
he
foretold
it
if
it
not
his
doing
the
damned
fellow
i
glanced
in
the
direction
kondrat
was
pointing
two
or
three
miles
ahead
of
us
behind
a
green
strip
of
low
fir
saplings
there
really
was
a
thick
column
of
dark
blue
smoke
slowly
rising
from
the
ground
gradually
twisting
and
coiling
into
a
cloud
to
the
right
and
left
of
it
could
be
seen
others
smaller
and
whiter
a
peasant
all
red
and
perspiring
in
nothing
but
his
shirt
with
his
hair
hanging
dishevelled
about
his
scared
face
galloped
straight
towards
us
and
with
difficulty
stopped
his
hastily
bridled
horse
he
inquired
breathlessly
you
seen
the
foresters
we
have
what
is
it
is
the
forest
on
fire
we
must
get
the
people
together
or
else
if
it
gets
to
trosnoe
the
peasant
tugged
with
his
elbows
pounded
with
his
heels
on
the
horse
sides
it
galloped
off
kondrat
too
whipped
up
his
pair
we
drove
straight
towards
the
smoke
which
was
spreading
more
and
more
widely
in
places
it
suddenly
grew
black
and
rose
up
high
the
nearer
we
moved
to
it
the
more
indefinite
became
its
outlines
soon
all
the
air
was
clouded
over
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
burning
and
here
and
there
between
the
trees
with
a
strange
weird
quivering
in
the
sunshine
gleamed
the
first
pale
red
tongues
of
flame
thank
god
observed
kondrat
seems
it
an
overground
fire
that
one
that
runs
along
over
the
earth
with
an
underground
fire
now
it
a
difficult
job
to
deal
what
one
to
do
when
the
earth
on
fire
for
a
whole
yard
depth
there
only
one
means
of
safety
digging
ditches
and
do
you
suppose
that
easy
but
an
overground
fire
nothing
it
only
scorches
the
grasses
and
burns
the
dry
leaves
the
forest
will
be
all
the
better
for
it
ouf
though
mercy
on
us
look
how
it
flares
we
drove
almost
up
to
the
edge
of
the
fire
i
got
down
and
went
to
meet
it
it
was
neither
dangerous
nor
difficult
the
fire
was
running
over
the
scanty
against
the
wind
it
moved
in
an
uneven
line
or
to
speak
more
accurately
in
a
dense
jagged
wall
of
curved
tongues
the
smoke
was
carried
away
by
the
wind
kondrat
had
told
the
truth
it
really
was
an
overground
fire
which
only
scorched
the
grass
and
passed
on
without
finishing
its
work
leaving
behind
it
a
black
and
smoking
but
not
even
smouldering
track
at
times
it
is
true
when
the
fire
came
upon
a
hole
filled
with
dry
wood
and
twigs
it
suddenly
and
with
a
kind
of
peculiar
rather
vindictive
roar
rose
up
in
long
quivering
points
but
it
soon
sank
down
again
and
ran
on
as
before
with
a
slight
hiss
and
crackle
i
even
noticed
more
than
once
an
with
dry
hanging
leaves
hemmed
in
all
round
and
yet
untouched
except
for
a
slight
singeing
at
its
base
i
must
own
i
could
not
understand
why
the
dry
leaves
were
not
burned
kondrat
explained
to
me
that
it
was
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
fire
was
overground
to
say
not
angry
it
fire
all
the
same
i
protested
fire
repeated
kondrat
however
overground
as
it
was
the
fire
none
the
less
produced
its
effect
hares
raced
up
and
down
with
a
sort
of
disorder
running
back
with
no
sort
of
necessity
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
fire
birds
fell
down
in
the
smoke
and
whirled
round
and
round
horses
looked
back
and
neighed
the
forest
itself
fairly
hummed
and
man
felt
discomfort
from
the
heat
suddenly
beating
into
his
face
are
we
looking
at
said
yegor
suddenly
behind
my
back
go
on
where
are
we
to
go
asked
kondrat
the
left
over
the
dry
bog
we
shall
get
through
we
turned
to
the
left
and
got
through
though
it
was
sometimes
difficult
for
both
the
horses
and
the
cart
the
whole
day
we
wandered
over
the
charred
wood
at
evening
the
sunset
had
not
yet
begun
to
redden
in
the
sky
but
the
shadows
from
the
trees
already
lay
long
and
motionless
and
in
the
grass
one
could
feel
that
chill
that
comes
before
the
dew
i
lay
down
by
the
roadside
near
the
cart
in
which
kondrat
without
haste
was
harnessing
the
horses
after
their
feed
and
i
recalled
my
cheerless
reveries
of
the
day
before
everything
around
was
as
still
as
the
previous
evening
but
there
was
not
the
forest
stifling
and
weighing
down
the
spirit
on
the
dry
moss
on
the
crimson
grasses
on
the
soft
dust
of
the
road
on
the
slender
stems
and
pure
little
leaves
of
the
young
lay
the
clear
soft
light
of
the
no
longer
scorching
sinking
sun
everything
was
resting
plunged
in
soothing
coolness
nothing
was
yet
asleep
but
everything
was
getting
ready
for
the
restoring
slumber
of
evening
and
everything
seemed
to
be
saying
to
man
brother
of
ours
breathe
lightly
and
grieve
not
thou
too
at
the
sleep
close
before
thee
i
raised
my
head
and
saw
at
the
very
end
of
a
delicate
twig
one
of
those
large
flies
with
emerald
head
long
body
and
four
transparent
wings
which
the
fanciful
french
call
while
our
guileless
people
has
named
them
for
a
long
while
more
than
an
hour
i
did
not
take
my
eyes
off
her
soaked
through
and
through
with
sunshine
she
did
not
stir
only
from
time
to
time
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
shaking
her
lifted
wings
that
was
all
looking
at
her
it
suddenly
seemed
to
me
that
i
understood
the
life
of
nature
understood
its
clear
and
unmistakable
though
to
many
still
mysterious
significance
a
subdued
quiet
animation
an
unhasting
restrained
use
of
sensations
and
powers
an
equilibrium
of
health
in
each
separate
creature
there
is
her
very
basis
her
unvarying
law
that
is
what
she
stands
upon
and
holds
to
everything
that
goes
beyond
this
level
above
or
below
it
makes
no
difference
she
flings
away
as
worthless
many
insects
die
as
soon
as
they
know
the
joys
of
love
which
destroy
the
equilibrium
the
sick
beast
plunges
into
the
thicket
and
expires
there
alone
he
seems
to
feel
that
he
no
longer
has
the
right
to
look
upon
the
sun
that
is
common
to
all
nor
to
breathe
the
open
air
he
has
not
the
right
to
live
and
the
man
who
from
his
own
fault
or
from
the
fault
of
others
is
faring
ill
in
the
world
ought
at
least
to
know
how
to
keep
silence
yegor
cried
kondrat
all
at
once
he
had
already
settled
himself
on
the
box
of
the
cart
and
was
shaking
and
playing
with
the
reins
sit
down
what
are
you
so
thoughtful
about
still
about
the
cow
the
cow
what
cow
i
repeated
and
looked
at
yegor
calm
and
stately
as
ever
he
certainly
did
seem
thoughtful
and
was
gazing
away
into
the
distance
towards
the
fields
already
beginning
to
get
dark
you
know
answered
kondrat
last
cow
died
last
night
he
has
no
what
are
you
going
to
do
yegor
sat
down
on
the
box
without
speaking
and
we
drove
off
man
knows
how
to
bear
in
silence
i
thought
yakov
pasinkov
i
it
happened
in
petersburg
in
the
winter
on
the
first
day
of
the
carnival
i
had
been
invited
to
dinner
by
one
of
my
schoolfellows
who
enjoyed
in
his
youth
the
reputation
of
being
as
modest
as
a
maiden
and
turned
out
in
the
sequel
a
person
by
no
means
over
rigid
in
his
conduct
he
is
dead
now
like
most
of
my
schoolfellows
there
were
to
be
present
at
the
dinner
besides
me
konstantin
alexandrovitch
asanov
and
a
literary
celebrity
of
those
days
the
literary
celebrity
kept
us
waiting
for
him
and
finally
sent
a
note
that
he
was
not
coming
and
in
place
of
him
there
turned
up
a
little
gentleman
one
of
the
everlasting
uninvited
guests
with
whom
petersburg
abounds
the
dinner
lasted
a
long
while
our
host
did
not
spare
the
wine
and
by
degrees
our
heads
were
affected
everything
that
each
of
us
kept
hidden
in
his
heart
and
who
is
there
that
has
not
something
hidden
in
his
heart
came
to
the
surface
our
host
face
suddenly
lost
its
modest
and
reserved
expression
his
eyes
shone
with
a
impudence
and
a
vulgar
grin
curved
his
lips
the
gentleman
laughed
in
a
feeble
way
with
a
senseless
crow
but
asanov
surprised
me
more
than
any
one
the
man
had
always
been
conspicuous
for
his
sense
of
propriety
but
now
he
began
by
suddenly
rubbing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
giving
himself
airs
boasting
of
his
connections
and
continually
alluding
to
a
certain
uncle
of
his
a
very
important
personage
i
positively
should
not
have
known
him
he
was
unmistakably
jeering
at
us
he
all
but
avowed
his
contempt
for
our
society
asanov
insolence
began
to
exasperate
me
i
said
to
him
we
are
such
poor
creatures
to
your
thinking
you
better
go
and
see
your
illustrious
uncle
but
possibly
he
not
at
home
to
you
asanov
made
me
no
reply
and
went
on
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
a
set
of
people
he
said
again
never
been
in
any
decent
society
never
been
acquainted
with
a
single
decent
woman
while
i
have
here
he
cried
hurriedly
pulling
a
out
of
his
and
tapping
it
with
his
hand
whole
pack
of
letters
from
a
girl
whom
you
would
find
the
equal
of
in
the
whole
world
our
host
and
the
gentleman
paid
no
attention
to
last
words
they
were
holding
each
other
by
their
buttons
and
both
relating
something
but
i
pricked
up
my
ears
you
bragging
nephew
of
an
illustrious
personage
i
said
going
up
to
asanov
have
any
letters
at
all
you
think
so
he
retorted
and
he
looked
down
loftily
at
me
this
then
he
opened
the
and
showed
me
about
a
dozen
letters
addressed
to
him
a
familiar
handwriting
i
fancied
i
feel
the
flush
of
shame
mounting
to
my
cheeks
my
is
suffering
horribly
no
one
likes
to
own
to
a
mean
action
but
there
is
nothing
for
it
when
i
began
my
story
i
knew
i
should
have
to
blush
to
my
ears
in
the
course
of
it
and
so
i
am
bound
to
harden
my
heart
and
confess
that
well
this
was
what
passed
i
took
advantage
of
the
intoxicated
condition
of
asanov
who
had
carelessly
dropped
the
letters
on
the
tablecloth
my
own
head
was
dizzy
enough
too
and
hurriedly
ran
my
eyes
over
one
of
the
letters
my
heart
stood
still
alas
i
was
myself
in
love
with
the
girl
who
had
written
to
asanov
and
i
could
have
no
doubt
now
that
she
loved
him
the
whole
letter
which
was
in
french
expressed
tenderness
and
devotion
cher
ami
constantin
so
it
began
and
it
ended
with
the
words
careful
as
before
and
i
will
be
yours
or
no
one
stunned
as
by
a
thunderbolt
i
sat
for
a
few
instants
motionless
at
last
i
regained
my
jumped
up
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
i
was
back
at
home
in
my
own
lodgings
the
family
of
the
zlotnitskys
was
one
of
the
first
whose
acquaintance
i
made
on
coming
to
petersburg
from
moscow
it
consisted
of
a
father
and
mother
two
daughters
and
a
son
the
father
a
man
already
grey
but
still
vigorous
who
had
been
in
the
army
held
a
fairly
important
position
spent
the
morning
in
a
government
office
went
to
sleep
after
dinner
and
in
the
evening
played
cards
at
his
club
he
was
seldom
at
home
spoke
little
and
unwillingly
looked
at
one
from
under
his
eyebrows
with
an
expression
half
surly
half
indifferent
and
read
nothing
except
books
of
travels
and
geography
sometimes
he
was
unwell
and
then
he
would
shut
himself
up
in
his
own
room
and
paint
little
pictures
or
tease
the
old
grey
parrot
popka
his
wife
a
sickly
consumptive
woman
with
hollow
black
eyes
and
a
sharp
nose
did
not
leave
her
sofa
for
days
together
and
was
always
embroidering
in
canvas
as
far
as
i
could
observe
she
was
rather
afraid
of
her
husband
as
though
she
had
somehow
wronged
him
at
some
time
or
other
the
elder
daughter
varvara
a
plump
rosy
girl
of
eighteen
was
always
sitting
at
the
window
watching
the
people
that
passed
by
the
son
who
was
being
educated
in
a
government
school
was
only
seen
at
home
on
sundays
and
he
too
did
not
care
to
waste
his
words
even
the
younger
daughter
sophia
the
girl
with
whom
i
was
in
love
was
of
a
silent
disposition
in
the
zlotnitskys
house
there
reigned
a
perpetual
stillness
it
was
only
broken
by
the
piercing
screams
of
popka
but
visitors
soon
got
used
to
these
and
were
conscious
again
of
the
burden
and
oppression
of
the
eternal
stillness
visitors
however
seldom
looked
in
upon
the
zlotnitskys
their
house
was
a
dull
one
the
very
furniture
the
red
paper
with
yellow
patterns
in
the
the
numerous
chairs
in
the
the
faded
cushions
embroidered
with
figures
of
girls
and
dogs
on
the
sofa
the
branching
lamps
and
the
portraits
on
the
walls
everything
inspired
an
involuntary
melancholy
about
everything
there
clung
a
sense
of
chill
and
flatness
on
my
arrival
in
petersburg
i
had
thought
it
my
duty
to
call
on
the
zlotnitskys
they
were
relations
of
my
mother
i
managed
with
difficulty
to
sit
out
an
hour
with
them
and
it
was
a
long
while
before
i
went
there
again
but
by
degrees
i
took
to
going
oftener
and
oftener
i
was
drawn
there
by
sophia
whom
i
had
not
cared
for
at
first
and
with
whom
i
finally
fell
in
love
she
was
a
slender
almost
thin
girl
of
medium
height
with
a
pale
face
thick
black
hair
and
big
brown
eyes
always
half
closed
her
severe
and
features
especially
her
tightly
shut
lips
showed
determination
and
strength
of
will
at
home
they
knew
her
to
be
a
girl
with
a
will
of
her
own
like
her
eldest
sister
like
katerina
madame
zlotnitsky
said
one
day
as
she
sat
alone
with
me
in
her
husband
presence
she
did
not
dare
to
mention
the
said
katerina
do
know
her
she
in
the
caucasus
married
at
thirteen
only
fancy
she
fell
in
love
with
her
husband
and
announced
to
us
at
the
time
that
she
would
never
marry
any
one
else
we
did
everything
we
could
nothing
was
of
any
use
she
waited
till
she
was
and
braved
her
father
anger
and
so
married
her
idol
there
is
no
saying
what
sonitchka
might
not
do
the
lord
preserve
her
from
such
stubbornness
but
i
am
afraid
for
her
she
only
sixteen
now
and
there
no
turning
her
zlotnitsky
came
in
and
his
wife
was
instantly
silent
what
had
captivated
me
in
sophia
was
not
her
strength
of
will
no
but
with
all
her
dryness
her
lack
of
vivacity
and
imagination
she
had
a
special
charm
of
her
own
the
charm
of
straightforwardness
genuine
sincerity
and
purity
of
heart
i
respected
her
as
much
as
i
loved
her
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
too
looked
with
friendly
eyes
on
me
to
have
my
illusions
as
to
her
feeling
for
me
shattered
and
her
love
for
another
man
proved
conclusively
was
a
blow
to
me
the
discovery
i
had
made
astonished
me
the
more
as
asanov
was
not
often
at
the
zlotnitskys
house
much
less
so
than
i
and
had
shown
no
marked
preference
for
sonitchka
he
was
a
handsome
dark
fellow
with
expressive
but
rather
heavy
features
with
brilliant
prominent
eyes
with
a
large
white
forehead
and
full
red
lips
under
fine
moustaches
he
was
very
discreet
but
severe
in
his
behaviour
confident
in
his
criticisms
and
utterances
and
dignified
in
his
silence
it
was
obvious
that
he
thought
a
great
deal
of
himself
asanov
rarely
laughed
and
then
with
closed
teeth
and
he
never
danced
he
was
rather
loosely
and
clumsily
built
he
had
at
one
time
served
in
the
th
regiment
and
was
spoken
of
as
a
capable
officer
strange
thing
i
ruminated
lying
on
the
sofa
was
it
i
noticed
nothing
careful
as
before
those
words
in
letter
suddenly
recurred
to
my
memory
i
thought
it
what
a
sly
little
hussy
and
i
thought
her
open
and
sincere
wait
a
bit
that
all
i
let
you
know
but
at
this
point
if
i
can
trust
my
memory
i
began
weeping
bitterly
and
could
not
get
to
sleep
all
night
next
day
at
two
i
set
off
to
the
zlotnitskys
the
father
was
not
at
home
and
his
wife
was
not
sitting
in
her
usual
place
after
the
pancake
festival
of
the
preceding
day
she
had
a
headache
and
had
gone
to
lie
down
in
her
bedroom
varvara
was
standing
with
her
shoulder
against
the
window
looking
into
the
street
sophia
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
her
arms
folded
across
her
bosom
popka
was
shrieking
how
do
you
do
said
varvara
lazily
directly
i
came
into
the
room
and
she
added
at
once
in
an
undertone
goes
a
peasant
with
a
tray
on
his
head
she
had
the
habit
of
keeping
up
a
running
commentary
on
the
to
herself
do
you
do
i
responded
do
you
do
sophia
nikolaevna
where
is
tatiana
vassilievna
has
gone
to
lie
down
answered
sophia
still
pacing
the
room
had
pancakes
observed
varvara
without
turning
round
you
come
where
can
that
clerk
be
going
i
had
time
arms
the
parrot
screeched
shrilly
popka
is
shrieking
always
does
shriek
like
that
observed
sophia
we
were
all
silent
for
a
time
has
gone
in
at
the
gate
said
varvara
and
she
suddenly
got
up
on
the
and
opened
the
window
are
you
about
asked
sophia
a
beggar
responded
varvara
she
bent
down
picked
up
a
piece
from
the
window
the
remains
of
a
fumigating
pastille
still
stood
in
a
grey
heap
of
ashes
on
the
copper
coin
as
she
flung
it
into
the
street
then
she
slammed
the
window
to
and
jumped
heavily
down
to
the
floor
had
a
very
pleasant
time
yesterday
i
began
seating
myself
in
an
dined
with
a
friend
of
mine
konstantin
alexandritch
was
there
i
looked
at
sophia
not
an
eyebrow
quivered
on
her
face
i
must
own
i
continued
a
good
deal
of
wine
we
emptied
eight
bottles
between
the
four
of
us
sophia
articulated
serenely
and
she
shook
her
head
i
went
on
slightly
irritated
at
her
composure
do
you
know
what
sophia
nikolaevna
it
a
true
saying
it
seems
that
in
wine
is
truth
so
alexandritch
made
us
laugh
only
fancy
he
began
all
at
once
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
like
this
and
saying
i
a
fine
fellow
i
an
uncle
a
celebrated
man
ha
came
varvara
short
abrupt
laugh
popka
popka
the
parrot
dinned
back
at
her
sophia
stood
still
in
front
of
me
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
you
what
did
you
say
she
asked
you
remember
i
could
not
help
blushing
do
remember
i
expect
i
was
pretty
absurd
too
it
certainly
is
dangerous
to
drink
i
added
with
significant
emphasis
begins
chattering
at
once
and
one
apt
to
say
what
no
one
ought
to
know
one
sure
to
be
sorry
for
it
afterwards
but
then
it
too
late
did
you
let
out
some
secret
asked
sophia
am
not
referring
to
myself
sophia
turned
away
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
again
i
stared
at
her
raging
inwardly
my
word
i
thought
is
a
child
a
baby
and
how
she
has
herself
in
hand
she
made
of
stone
simply
but
wait
a
bit
nikolaevna
i
said
aloud
sophia
stopped
is
it
you
play
me
something
on
the
piano
by
the
way
i
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
i
added
dropping
my
voice
sophia
without
saying
a
word
walked
into
the
other
room
i
followed
her
she
came
to
a
standstill
at
the
piano
am
i
to
play
you
she
inquired
you
like
one
of
chopin
nocturnes
sophia
began
the
nocturne
she
played
rather
badly
but
with
feeling
her
sister
played
nothing
but
polkas
and
waltzes
and
even
that
very
seldom
she
would
go
sometimes
with
her
indolent
step
to
the
piano
sit
down
let
her
coat
slip
from
her
shoulders
down
to
her
elbows
i
never
saw
her
without
a
coat
begin
playing
a
polka
very
loud
and
without
finishing
it
begin
another
then
she
would
suddenly
heave
a
sigh
get
up
and
go
back
again
to
the
window
a
queer
creature
was
that
varvara
i
sat
down
near
sophia
nikolaevna
i
began
watching
her
intently
from
one
side
ought
to
tell
you
a
piece
of
news
news
disagreeable
to
me
what
is
it
tell
you
up
till
now
i
have
been
mistaken
in
you
completely
mistaken
was
that
she
rejoined
going
on
playing
and
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
fingers
imagined
you
to
be
open
i
imagined
that
you
were
incapable
of
hypocrisy
of
hiding
your
feelings
deceiving
sophia
bent
her
face
closer
over
the
music
do
understand
you
what
more
i
went
on
could
never
have
conceived
that
you
at
your
age
were
already
quite
capable
of
acting
a
part
in
such
masterly
fashion
sophia
hands
faintly
trembled
above
the
keys
are
you
saying
this
she
said
still
not
looking
at
me
play
a
part
you
do
she
smiled
i
was
seized
with
spiteful
fury
pretend
to
be
indifferent
to
a
man
and
and
you
write
letters
to
him
i
added
in
a
whisper
sophia
cheeks
grew
white
but
she
did
not
turn
to
me
she
played
the
nocturne
through
to
the
end
got
up
and
closed
the
piano
are
you
going
i
asked
her
in
some
perplexity
have
no
answer
to
make
me
answer
can
i
make
you
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
and
i
am
not
good
at
pretending
she
began
putting
by
the
music
the
blood
rushed
to
my
head
you
know
what
i
am
talking
about
i
said
and
i
too
got
up
from
my
seat
if
you
like
i
will
remind
you
directly
of
some
of
your
expressions
in
one
letter
be
as
careful
as
before
sophia
gave
a
faint
start
never
should
have
expected
this
of
you
she
said
at
last
never
should
have
expected
i
retorted
you
sophia
nikolaevna
would
have
deigned
to
notice
a
man
who
sophia
turned
with
a
rapid
movement
to
me
i
instinctively
stepped
back
a
little
from
her
her
eyes
always
half
closed
were
so
wide
open
that
they
looked
immense
and
they
glittered
wrathfully
under
her
frowning
brows
if
that
it
she
said
me
tell
you
that
i
love
that
man
and
that
it
absolutely
no
consequence
to
me
what
you
think
about
him
or
about
my
love
for
him
and
what
business
is
it
of
yours
what
right
have
you
to
speak
of
this
if
i
have
made
up
my
mind
she
stopped
speaking
and
went
hurriedly
out
of
the
room
i
stood
still
i
felt
all
of
a
sudden
so
uncomfortable
and
so
ashamed
that
i
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
i
realised
all
the
impropriety
all
the
baseness
of
my
behaviour
and
choked
with
shame
and
remorse
i
stood
as
it
were
in
disgrace
i
thought
i
done
nikititch
i
heard
the
saying
in
the
a
glass
of
water
quick
for
sophia
nikolaevna
wrong
answered
the
man
fancy
she
crying
i
started
up
and
went
into
the
for
my
hat
were
you
talking
about
to
sonitchka
varvara
inquired
indifferently
and
after
a
brief
pause
she
added
in
an
undertone
that
clerk
again
i
began
saying
are
you
going
stay
a
little
mamma
is
coming
down
directly
i
ca
now
i
said
had
better
call
and
see
her
another
time
at
that
instant
to
my
horror
to
my
positive
horror
sophia
walked
with
resolute
steps
into
the
her
face
was
paler
than
usual
and
her
eyelids
were
a
little
red
she
never
even
glanced
at
me
sonia
observed
varvara
a
clerk
keeps
continually
passing
our
house
spy
perhaps
sophia
remarked
coldly
and
contemptuously
this
was
too
much
i
went
away
and
i
really
do
know
how
i
got
home
i
felt
very
miserable
wretched
and
miserable
beyond
description
in
hours
two
such
cruel
blows
i
had
learned
that
sophia
loved
another
man
and
i
had
for
ever
forfeited
her
respect
i
felt
myself
so
utterly
annihilated
and
disgraced
that
i
could
not
even
feel
indignant
with
myself
lying
on
the
sofa
with
my
face
turned
to
the
wall
i
was
revelling
in
the
first
rush
of
despairing
misery
when
i
suddenly
heard
footsteps
in
the
room
i
lifted
my
head
and
saw
one
of
my
most
intimate
friends
yakov
pasinkov
i
was
ready
to
fly
into
a
rage
with
any
one
who
had
come
into
my
room
that
day
but
with
pasinkov
i
could
never
be
angry
quite
the
contrary
in
spite
of
the
sorrow
devouring
me
i
was
inwardly
rejoiced
at
his
coming
and
i
nodded
to
him
he
walked
twice
up
and
down
the
room
as
his
habit
was
clearing
his
throat
and
stretching
out
his
long
limbs
then
he
stood
a
minute
facing
me
in
silence
and
in
silence
he
seated
himself
in
a
corner
i
had
known
pasinkov
a
very
long
while
almost
from
childhood
he
had
been
brought
up
at
the
same
private
school
kept
by
a
german
winterkeller
at
which
i
had
spent
three
years
yakov
father
a
poor
major
on
the
retired
list
a
very
honest
man
but
a
little
deranged
mentally
had
brought
him
when
a
boy
of
seven
to
this
german
had
paid
for
him
for
a
year
in
advance
and
had
then
left
moscow
and
been
lost
sight
of
completely
from
time
to
time
there
were
dark
strange
rumours
about
him
eight
years
later
it
was
known
as
a
positive
fact
that
he
had
been
drowned
in
a
flood
when
crossing
the
irtish
what
had
taken
him
to
siberia
god
knows
yakov
had
no
other
relations
his
mother
had
long
been
dead
he
was
simply
left
stranded
on
winterkeller
hands
yakov
had
it
is
true
a
distant
relation
a
but
she
was
so
poor
that
she
was
afraid
at
first
to
go
to
her
nephew
for
fear
she
should
have
the
care
of
him
thrust
upon
her
her
fears
turned
out
to
be
groundless
the
german
kept
yakov
with
him
let
him
study
with
his
other
pupils
fed
him
dessert
however
was
not
offered
him
except
on
sundays
and
rigged
him
out
in
clothes
cut
out
of
the
usually
of
his
mother
an
old
livonian
lady
still
alert
and
active
in
spite
of
her
great
age
owing
to
all
these
circumstances
and
owing
generally
to
yakov
inferior
position
in
the
school
his
schoolfellows
treated
him
in
rather
a
casual
fashion
looked
down
upon
him
and
used
to
call
him
the
of
the
his
aunt
invariably
wore
a
very
peculiar
with
a
bunch
of
yellow
ribbons
sticking
straight
upright
like
a
globe
artichoke
upon
it
and
sometimes
the
of
yermak
because
his
father
had
like
that
hero
been
drowned
in
the
irtish
but
in
spite
of
those
nicknames
in
spite
of
his
ridiculous
garb
and
his
absolute
destitution
every
one
was
fond
of
him
and
indeed
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
fond
of
him
a
sweeter
nobler
nature
i
imagine
has
never
existed
upon
earth
he
was
very
good
at
lessons
too
when
i
saw
him
first
he
was
sixteen
years
old
and
i
was
only
just
thirteen
i
was
an
exceedingly
selfish
and
spoilt
boy
i
had
grown
up
in
a
rather
wealthy
house
and
so
on
entering
the
school
i
lost
no
time
in
making
friends
with
a
little
prince
an
object
of
special
solicitude
to
winterkeller
and
with
two
or
three
other
juvenile
aristocrats
while
i
gave
myself
great
airs
with
all
the
rest
pasinkov
i
did
not
deign
to
notice
at
all
i
regarded
the
long
gawky
lad
in
a
shapeless
coat
and
short
trousers
which
showed
his
coarse
thread
stockings
as
some
sort
of
one
of
the
at
best
a
person
of
the
working
class
pasinkov
was
extremely
courteous
and
gentle
to
everybody
though
he
never
sought
the
society
of
any
one
if
he
were
rudely
treated
he
was
neither
humiliated
nor
sullen
he
simply
withdrew
and
held
himself
aloof
with
a
sort
of
regretful
look
as
it
were
biding
his
time
this
was
just
how
he
behaved
with
me
about
two
months
passed
one
bright
summer
day
i
happened
to
go
out
of
the
playground
after
a
noisy
game
of
and
walking
into
the
garden
i
saw
pasinkov
sitting
on
a
bench
under
a
high
he
was
reading
i
glanced
at
the
cover
of
the
book
as
i
passed
and
read
on
the
back
i
stopped
short
you
mean
to
say
you
know
german
i
questioned
pasinkov
i
feel
ashamed
to
this
day
as
i
recall
all
the
arrogance
there
was
in
the
very
sound
of
my
voice
pasinkov
softly
raised
his
small
but
expressive
eyes
and
looked
at
me
he
answered
you
should
hope
so
i
retorted
feeling
insulted
at
the
question
and
i
was
about
to
go
on
my
way
but
something
held
me
back
is
it
you
are
reading
of
schiller
i
asked
with
the
same
haughty
insolence
this
moment
i
am
reading
resignation
a
beautiful
poem
would
you
like
me
to
read
it
to
you
come
and
sit
here
by
me
on
the
bench
i
hesitated
a
little
but
i
sat
down
pasinkov
began
reading
he
knew
german
far
better
than
i
did
he
had
to
explain
the
meaning
of
several
lines
for
me
but
already
i
felt
no
shame
at
my
ignorance
and
his
superiority
to
me
from
that
day
from
the
very
hour
of
our
reading
together
in
the
garden
in
the
shade
of
the
i
loved
pasinkov
with
my
whole
soul
i
attached
myself
to
him
and
fell
completely
under
his
sway
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
his
appearance
in
those
days
he
changed
very
little
however
later
on
he
was
tall
thin
and
rather
awkwardly
built
with
a
long
back
narrow
shoulders
and
a
hollow
chest
which
made
him
look
rather
frail
and
delicate
although
as
a
fact
he
had
nothing
to
complain
of
on
the
score
of
health
his
large
head
was
carried
a
little
on
one
side
his
soft
flaxen
hair
straggled
in
lank
locks
about
his
slender
neck
his
face
was
not
handsome
and
might
even
have
struck
one
as
absurd
owing
to
the
long
full
and
reddish
nose
which
seemed
almost
to
overhang
his
wide
straight
mouth
but
his
open
brow
was
splendid
and
when
he
smiled
his
little
grey
eyes
gleamed
with
such
mild
and
affectionate
goodness
that
every
one
felt
warmed
and
cheered
at
heart
at
the
very
sight
of
him
i
remember
his
voice
too
soft
and
even
with
a
peculiar
sort
of
sweet
huskiness
in
it
he
spoke
as
a
rule
little
and
with
noticeable
difficulty
but
when
he
warmed
up
his
words
flowed
freely
and
strange
to
say
his
voice
grew
still
softer
his
glance
seemed
turned
inward
and
lost
its
fire
while
his
whole
face
faintly
glowed
on
his
lips
the
words
however
enthusiastically
they
were
uttered
never
rang
with
a
false
note
without
strain
without
effort
he
stepped
into
the
realm
of
the
ideal
his
pure
soul
was
at
any
moment
ready
to
stand
before
the
shrine
of
beauty
it
awaited
only
the
welcoming
call
the
contact
of
another
soul
pasinkov
was
an
idealist
one
of
the
last
idealists
whom
it
has
been
my
lot
to
come
across
idealists
as
we
all
know
are
all
but
extinct
in
these
days
there
are
none
of
them
at
any
rate
among
the
young
people
of
to
day
so
much
the
worse
for
the
young
people
of
about
three
years
i
spent
with
pasinkov
in
soul
as
the
saying
is
i
was
the
confidant
of
his
first
love
with
what
grateful
sympathy
and
intentness
i
listened
to
his
avowal
the
object
of
his
passion
was
a
niece
of
winterkeller
a
pretty
little
german
with
a
chubby
almost
childish
little
face
and
confidingly
soft
blue
eyes
she
was
very
kind
and
sentimental
she
loved
mattison
uhland
and
schiller
and
repeated
their
verses
very
sweetly
in
her
timid
musical
voice
pasinkov
love
was
of
the
most
platonic
he
only
saw
his
beloved
on
sundays
when
she
used
to
come
and
play
at
forfeits
with
the
winterkeller
children
and
he
had
very
little
conversation
with
her
but
once
when
she
said
to
him
lieber
lieber
herr
jacob
he
did
not
sleep
all
night
from
excess
of
bliss
it
never
even
struck
him
at
the
time
that
she
called
all
his
schoolfellows
lieber
i
remember
too
his
grief
and
dejection
when
the
news
suddenly
reached
us
that
fräulein
frederike
that
was
her
name
was
going
to
be
married
to
herr
kniftus
the
owner
of
a
prosperous
butcher
shop
a
very
handsome
man
and
well
educated
too
and
that
she
was
marrying
him
not
simply
in
submission
to
parental
authority
but
positively
from
love
it
was
a
bitter
blow
for
pasinkov
and
his
sufferings
were
particularly
severe
on
the
day
of
the
young
people
first
visit
the
former
fräulein
now
frau
frederike
presented
him
once
more
addressing
him
as
herr
jacob
to
her
husband
who
was
all
splendour
from
top
to
toe
his
eyes
his
black
hair
brushed
up
into
a
tuft
his
forehead
and
his
teeth
and
his
coat
buttons
and
the
chain
on
his
waistcoat
everything
down
to
the
boots
on
his
rather
large
feet
shone
brilliantly
pasinkov
pressed
herr
kniftus
hand
and
wished
him
and
the
wish
was
sincere
that
i
am
certain
complete
and
enduring
happiness
this
took
place
in
my
presence
i
remember
with
what
admiration
and
sympathy
i
gazed
at
yakov
i
thought
him
a
hero
and
afterwards
what
mournful
conversations
passed
between
us
consolation
in
art
i
said
to
him
he
answered
me
in
poetry
in
friendship
i
added
in
friendship
he
repeated
oh
happy
days
it
was
a
grief
to
me
to
part
from
pasinkov
just
before
i
left
school
he
had
after
prolonged
efforts
and
difficulties
after
a
correspondence
often
amusing
succeeded
in
obtaining
his
certificates
of
birth
and
baptism
and
his
passport
and
had
entered
the
university
he
still
went
on
living
at
winterkeller
expense
but
instead
of
jackets
and
breeches
he
was
provided
now
with
ordinary
attire
in
return
for
lessons
on
various
subjects
which
he
gave
the
younger
pupils
pasinkov
was
unchanged
in
his
behaviour
to
me
up
to
the
end
of
my
time
at
the
school
though
the
difference
in
our
ages
began
to
be
more
noticeable
and
i
i
remember
grew
jealous
of
some
of
his
new
student
friends
his
influence
on
me
was
most
beneficial
it
was
a
pity
it
did
not
last
longer
to
give
a
single
instance
as
a
child
i
was
in
the
habit
of
telling
lies
in
yakov
presence
i
could
not
bring
my
tongue
to
utter
an
untruth
what
i
particularly
loved
was
walking
alone
with
him
or
pacing
by
his
side
up
and
down
the
room
listening
while
he
not
looking
at
me
read
poetry
in
his
soft
intense
voice
it
positively
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
slowly
gradually
getting
away
from
the
earth
and
soaring
away
to
some
radiant
glorious
land
of
mystery
i
remember
one
night
we
were
sitting
together
under
the
same
we
were
fond
of
that
spot
all
our
companions
were
asleep
but
we
had
softly
got
up
dressed
fumbling
in
the
dark
and
stealthily
stepped
out
dream
it
was
fairly
warm
out
of
doors
but
a
fresh
breeze
blew
now
and
then
and
made
us
huddle
closer
together
we
talked
we
talked
a
lot
and
with
much
warmth
so
much
so
that
we
positively
interrupted
each
other
though
we
did
not
argue
in
the
sky
gleamed
stars
innumerable
yakov
raised
his
eyes
and
pressing
my
hand
he
softly
cried
out
our
heads
the
sky
with
the
eternal
stars
above
the
stars
their
maker
a
thrill
of
awe
ran
through
me
i
felt
cold
all
over
and
sank
on
his
shoulder
my
heart
was
full
where
are
those
raptures
alas
where
youth
is
in
petersburg
i
met
yakov
again
eight
years
after
i
had
only
just
been
appointed
to
a
position
in
the
service
and
some
one
had
got
him
a
little
post
in
some
department
our
meeting
was
most
joyful
i
shall
never
forget
the
moment
when
sitting
alone
one
day
at
home
i
suddenly
heard
his
voice
in
the
passage
how
i
started
with
what
throbbing
at
the
heart
i
leaped
up
and
flung
myself
on
his
neck
without
giving
him
time
to
take
off
his
fur
overcoat
and
unfasten
his
scarf
how
greedily
i
gazed
at
him
through
bright
involuntary
tears
of
tenderness
he
had
grown
a
little
older
during
those
seven
years
lines
delicate
as
if
they
had
been
traced
by
a
needle
furrowed
his
brow
here
and
there
his
cheeks
were
a
little
more
hollow
and
his
hair
was
thinner
but
he
had
hardly
more
beard
and
his
smile
was
just
the
same
as
ever
and
his
laugh
a
soft
inward
as
it
were
breathless
laugh
was
the
same
too
mercy
on
us
what
did
we
talk
about
that
day
the
favourite
poems
we
read
to
one
another
i
began
begging
him
to
move
and
come
and
live
with
me
but
he
would
not
consent
he
promised
however
to
come
every
day
to
see
me
and
he
kept
his
word
in
soul
too
pasinkov
was
unchanged
he
showed
himself
just
the
same
idealist
as
i
had
always
known
him
however
rudely
life
chill
the
bitter
chill
of
experience
had
closed
in
about
him
the
tender
flower
that
had
bloomed
so
early
in
my
friend
heart
had
kept
all
its
pure
beauty
untouched
there
was
no
trace
of
sadness
even
no
trace
even
of
melancholy
in
him
he
was
quiet
as
he
had
always
been
but
everlastingly
glad
at
heart
in
petersburg
he
lived
as
in
a
wilderness
not
thinking
of
the
future
and
knowing
scarcely
any
one
i
took
him
to
the
zlotnitskys
he
used
to
go
and
see
them
rather
often
not
being
he
was
not
shy
but
in
their
house
as
everywhere
he
said
very
little
they
liked
him
however
even
the
tedious
old
man
tatiana
vassilievna
husband
was
friendly
to
him
and
both
the
silent
girls
were
soon
quite
at
home
with
him
sometimes
he
would
arrive
bringing
with
him
in
the
back
pocket
of
his
coat
some
book
that
had
just
come
out
and
for
a
long
time
would
not
make
up
his
mind
to
read
but
would
keep
stretching
his
neck
out
on
one
side
like
a
bird
looking
about
him
as
though
inquiring
he
at
last
he
would
establish
himself
in
a
corner
he
always
liked
sitting
in
corners
would
pull
out
a
book
and
set
to
reading
at
first
in
a
whisper
then
louder
and
louder
occasionally
interrupting
himself
with
brief
criticisms
or
exclamations
i
noticed
that
varvara
was
readier
to
sit
by
him
and
listen
than
her
sister
though
she
certainly
did
not
understand
much
literature
was
not
in
her
line
she
would
sit
opposite
pasinkov
her
chin
in
her
hands
staring
at
him
not
into
his
eyes
but
into
his
whole
face
and
would
not
utter
a
syllable
but
only
heave
a
noisy
sudden
sigh
sometimes
in
the
evenings
we
used
to
play
forfeits
especially
on
sundays
and
holidays
we
were
joined
on
these
occasions
by
two
plump
short
young
ladies
sisters
and
distant
relations
of
the
zlotnitskys
terribly
given
to
giggling
and
a
few
lads
from
the
military
school
very
quiet
fellows
pasinkov
always
used
to
sit
beside
tatiana
vassilievna
and
with
her
judge
what
was
to
be
done
to
the
one
who
had
to
pay
a
forfeit
sophia
did
not
like
the
kisses
and
such
demonstrations
with
which
forfeits
are
often
paid
while
varvara
used
to
be
cross
if
she
had
to
look
for
anything
or
guess
something
the
young
ladies
giggled
incessantly
laughter
seemed
to
bubble
up
by
some
magic
in
them
i
sometimes
felt
positively
irritated
as
i
looked
at
them
but
pasinkov
only
smiled
and
shook
his
head
old
zlotnitsky
took
no
part
in
our
games
and
even
looked
at
us
rather
disapprovingly
from
the
door
of
his
study
only
once
utterly
unexpectedly
he
came
in
to
us
and
proposed
that
whoever
had
next
to
pay
a
forfeit
should
waltz
with
him
we
of
course
agreed
it
happened
to
be
tatiana
vassilievna
who
had
to
pay
the
forfeit
she
crimsoned
all
over
and
was
confused
and
abashed
like
a
girl
of
fifteen
but
her
husband
at
once
told
sophia
to
go
to
the
piano
while
he
went
up
to
his
wife
and
waltzed
two
rounds
with
her
of
the
waltz
i
remember
how
his
bilious
gloomy
face
with
its
eyes
kept
appearing
and
disappearing
as
he
slowly
turned
round
his
stern
expression
never
relaxing
he
waltzed
with
a
long
step
and
a
hop
while
his
wife
pattered
rapidly
with
her
feet
and
huddled
up
with
her
face
close
to
his
chest
as
though
she
were
in
terror
he
led
her
to
her
place
bowed
to
her
went
back
to
his
room
and
shut
the
door
sophia
was
just
getting
up
but
varvara
asked
her
to
go
on
went
up
to
pasinkov
and
holding
out
her
hand
with
an
awkward
smile
said
you
like
a
turn
pasinkov
was
surprised
but
he
jumped
up
he
was
always
distinguished
by
the
most
delicate
courtesy
and
took
varvara
by
the
waist
but
he
slipped
down
at
the
first
step
and
leaving
hold
of
his
partner
at
once
rolled
right
under
the
pedestal
on
which
the
cage
was
standing
the
cage
fell
the
parrot
was
frightened
and
shrieked
arms
every
one
laughed
zlotnitsky
appeared
at
his
study
door
looked
grimly
at
us
and
slammed
the
door
to
from
that
time
forth
one
had
only
to
allude
to
this
incident
before
varvara
and
she
would
go
off
into
peals
of
laughter
at
once
and
look
at
pasinkov
as
though
anything
cleverer
than
his
behaviour
on
that
occasion
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
pasinkov
was
very
fond
of
music
he
used
often
to
beg
sophia
to
play
him
something
and
to
sit
on
one
side
listening
and
now
and
then
humming
in
a
thin
voice
the
most
pathetic
passages
he
was
particularly
fond
of
schubert
constellation
he
used
to
declare
that
when
he
heard
the
air
played
he
could
always
fancy
that
with
the
sounds
long
rays
of
azure
light
came
pouring
down
from
on
high
straight
upon
him
to
this
day
whenever
i
look
upon
a
cloudless
sky
at
night
with
the
softly
quivering
stars
i
always
recall
schubert
melody
and
pasinkov
an
excursion
into
the
country
comes
back
to
my
mind
we
set
out
a
whole
party
of
us
in
two
hired
carriages
to
pargolovo
i
remember
we
took
the
carriages
from
the
vladimirsky
they
were
very
old
and
painted
blue
with
round
springs
and
a
wide
and
bundles
of
hay
inside
the
brown
horses
that
drew
us
along
at
a
slow
trot
were
each
lame
in
a
different
leg
we
strolled
a
long
while
about
the
pinewoods
round
pargolovo
drank
milk
out
of
earthenware
pitchers
and
ate
wild
strawberries
and
sugar
the
weather
was
exquisite
varvara
did
not
care
for
long
walks
she
used
soon
to
get
tired
but
this
time
she
did
not
lag
behind
us
she
took
off
her
hat
her
hair
came
down
her
heavy
features
lighted
up
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
meeting
two
peasant
girls
in
the
wood
she
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
ground
called
them
to
her
did
not
patronise
them
but
made
them
sit
down
beside
her
sophia
looked
at
them
from
some
distance
with
a
cold
smile
and
did
not
go
up
to
them
she
was
walking
with
asanov
zlotnitsky
observed
that
varvara
was
a
regular
hen
for
sitting
varvara
got
up
and
walked
away
in
the
course
of
the
walk
she
several
times
went
up
to
pasinkov
and
said
to
him
ivanitch
i
want
to
tell
you
something
but
what
she
wanted
to
tell
him
remained
unknown
but
it
high
time
for
me
to
get
back
to
my
story
i
was
glad
to
see
pasinkov
but
when
i
recalled
what
i
had
done
the
day
before
i
felt
unutterably
ashamed
and
i
hurriedly
turned
away
to
the
wall
again
after
a
brief
pause
yakov
asked
me
if
i
were
unwell
quite
well
i
answered
through
my
teeth
my
head
aches
yakov
made
no
reply
and
took
up
a
book
more
than
an
hour
passed
by
i
was
just
coming
to
the
point
of
confessing
everything
to
yakov
suddenly
there
was
a
ring
at
the
outer
bell
of
my
flat
the
door
on
to
the
stairs
was
opened
i
listened
asanov
was
asking
my
servant
if
i
were
at
home
pasinkov
got
up
he
did
not
care
for
asanov
and
telling
me
in
a
whisper
that
he
would
go
and
lie
down
on
my
bed
he
went
into
my
bedroom
a
minute
later
asanov
entered
from
the
very
sight
of
his
flushed
face
from
his
brief
cool
bow
i
guessed
that
he
had
not
come
to
me
without
some
set
purpose
in
his
mind
is
going
to
happen
i
wondered
he
began
quickly
seating
himself
in
an
armchair
have
come
to
you
for
you
to
settle
a
matter
of
doubt
for
me
that
is
is
i
wish
to
know
whether
you
are
an
honest
man
i
flew
into
a
rage
the
meaning
of
that
i
demanded
tell
you
what
the
meaning
of
it
he
retorted
underlining
as
it
were
each
word
i
showed
you
a
containing
letters
from
a
certain
person
to
me
you
repeated
to
that
person
with
reproach
with
reproach
observe
some
expressions
from
those
letters
without
having
the
slightest
right
to
do
so
i
should
like
to
know
what
explanation
you
can
give
of
this
i
should
like
to
know
what
right
you
have
to
me
i
answered
trembling
with
fury
and
inward
shame
chose
to
boast
of
your
uncle
of
your
correspondence
i
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
got
all
your
letters
all
right
have
you
letters
are
all
right
but
i
was
yesterday
in
a
condition
in
which
you
could
easily
short
sir
i
began
speaking
intentionally
as
loud
as
i
could
beg
you
to
leave
me
alone
do
you
hear
i
do
want
to
know
anything
about
it
and
i
not
going
to
give
you
any
explanation
you
can
go
to
that
person
for
explanations
i
felt
that
my
head
was
beginning
to
go
round
asanov
turned
upon
me
a
look
to
which
he
obviously
tried
to
impart
an
air
of
scornful
penetration
pulled
his
moustaches
and
got
up
slowly
know
now
what
to
think
he
observed
face
is
the
best
evidence
against
you
but
i
must
tell
you
that
that
not
the
way
honourable
people
behave
to
read
a
letter
on
the
sly
and
then
to
go
and
worry
an
honourable
girl
you
go
to
the
devil
i
shouted
stamping
send
me
a
second
i
do
mean
to
talk
to
you
refrain
from
telling
me
what
to
do
asanov
retorted
frigidly
i
certainly
will
send
a
second
to
you
he
went
away
i
fell
on
the
sofa
and
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
some
one
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
i
moved
my
hands
before
me
was
standing
pasinkov
this
is
it
true
he
asked
me
read
another
letter
i
had
not
the
strength
to
answer
but
i
nodded
in
assent
pasinkov
went
to
the
window
and
standing
with
his
back
to
me
said
slowly
read
a
letter
from
a
girl
to
asanov
who
was
the
girl
zlotnitsky
i
answered
as
a
prisoner
on
his
trial
answers
the
judge
for
a
long
while
pasinkov
did
not
utter
a
word
but
passion
could
to
some
extent
excuse
you
he
began
at
last
you
in
love
then
with
the
younger
zlotnitsky
pasinkov
was
silent
again
for
a
little
thought
so
and
you
went
to
her
and
began
reproaching
her
yes
yes
i
articulated
desperately
you
can
despise
me
pasinkov
walked
a
couple
of
times
up
and
down
the
room
she
loves
him
he
queried
loves
him
pasinkov
looked
down
and
gazed
a
long
while
at
the
floor
without
moving
it
must
be
set
right
he
began
raising
his
head
things
be
left
like
this
and
he
took
up
his
hat
are
you
going
asanov
i
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
i
wo
let
you
good
heavens
how
can
you
what
will
he
think
pasinkov
looked
at
me
do
you
think
it
better
to
keep
this
folly
up
to
bring
ruin
on
yourself
and
disgrace
on
the
girl
what
are
you
going
to
say
to
asanov
try
and
explain
things
to
him
i
tell
him
you
beg
his
forgiveness
i
do
want
to
apologise
to
him
do
why
are
you
in
fault
i
looked
at
pasinkov
the
calm
and
severe
though
mournful
expression
of
his
face
impressed
me
it
was
new
to
me
i
made
no
reply
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
pasinkov
went
out
in
what
agonies
of
suspense
i
waited
for
his
return
with
what
cruel
slowness
the
time
lingered
by
at
last
he
came
back
late
i
queried
in
a
timid
voice
goodness
he
answered
all
settled
have
been
at
asanov
and
he
made
a
great
i
suppose
i
articulated
with
an
effort
i
ca
say
that
i
expected
more
he
he
not
such
a
vulgar
fellow
as
i
thought
and
have
you
seen
any
one
else
besides
i
asked
after
a
brief
pause
been
at
the
zlotnitskys
my
heart
began
to
throb
i
did
not
dare
look
pasinkov
in
the
face
and
she
nikolaevna
is
a
reasonable
girl
yes
she
is
a
girl
she
felt
awkward
at
first
but
she
was
soon
at
ease
but
our
whole
conversation
only
lasted
five
minutes
you
told
her
everything
about
me
everything
told
her
what
was
necessary
shall
never
be
able
to
go
and
see
them
again
now
i
pronounced
dejectedly
no
you
can
go
occasionally
on
the
contrary
you
are
absolutely
bound
to
go
and
see
them
so
that
nothing
should
be
thought
yakov
you
will
despise
me
now
i
cried
hardly
keeping
back
my
tears
despise
you
his
affectionate
eyes
glowed
with
love
you
silly
fellow
do
i
see
how
hard
it
been
for
you
how
you
suffering
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
i
fell
on
his
neck
and
broke
into
sobs
after
a
few
days
during
which
i
noticed
that
pasinkov
was
in
very
low
spirits
i
made
up
my
mind
at
last
to
go
to
the
zlotnitskys
what
i
felt
as
i
stepped
into
their
it
would
be
difficult
to
convey
in
words
i
remember
that
i
could
hardly
distinguish
the
persons
in
the
room
and
my
voice
failed
me
sophia
was
no
less
ill
at
ease
she
obviously
forced
herself
to
address
me
but
her
eyes
avoided
mine
as
mine
did
hers
and
every
movement
she
made
her
whole
being
expressed
constraint
mingled
why
conceal
the
truth
with
secret
aversion
i
tried
as
far
as
possible
to
spare
her
and
myself
from
such
painful
sensations
this
meeting
was
happily
our
last
before
her
marriage
a
sudden
change
in
my
fortunes
carried
me
off
to
the
other
end
of
russia
and
i
bade
a
long
farewell
to
petersburg
to
the
zlotnitsky
family
and
what
was
most
grievous
of
all
for
me
to
dear
yakov
pasinkov
ii
seven
years
had
passed
by
i
do
think
it
necessary
to
relate
all
that
happened
to
me
during
that
period
i
moved
restlessly
about
over
russia
and
made
my
way
into
the
remotest
wilds
and
thank
god
i
did
the
wilds
are
not
so
much
to
be
dreaded
as
some
people
suppose
and
in
the
most
hidden
places
under
the
fallen
twigs
and
rotting
leaves
in
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
spring
up
flowers
of
sweet
fragrance
one
day
in
spring
as
i
was
passing
on
some
official
duties
through
a
small
town
in
one
of
the
outlying
provinces
of
eastern
russia
through
the
dim
little
window
of
my
coach
i
saw
standing
before
a
shop
in
the
square
a
man
whose
face
struck
me
as
exceedingly
familiar
i
looked
attentively
at
the
man
and
to
my
great
delight
recognised
him
as
elisei
pasinkov
servant
i
at
once
told
the
driver
to
stop
jumped
out
of
the
coach
and
went
up
to
elisei
friend
i
began
with
difficulty
concealing
my
excitement
you
here
with
your
master
i
with
my
master
he
responded
slowly
and
then
suddenly
cried
out
sir
is
it
you
i
did
know
you
you
here
with
yakov
ivanitch
sir
with
him
to
be
sure
whom
else
would
i
be
with
me
to
him
quickly
be
sure
to
be
sure
this
way
please
this
way
we
stopping
here
at
the
tavern
elisei
led
me
across
the
square
incessantly
repeating
now
wo
yakov
ivanitch
be
pleased
this
man
of
kalmuck
extraction
and
hideous
even
savage
appearance
but
the
creature
and
by
no
means
a
fool
was
passionately
devoted
to
pasinkov
and
had
been
his
servant
for
ten
years
yakov
ivanitch
quite
well
i
asked
him
elisei
turned
his
dusky
yellow
little
face
to
me
sir
he
in
a
poor
way
in
a
poor
way
sir
you
wo
know
his
honour
he
not
long
for
this
world
i
afraid
that
how
it
is
we
stopped
here
or
we
had
been
going
on
to
odessa
for
his
health
do
you
come
from
siberia
sir
siberia
sir
yakov
ivanitch
was
sent
to
a
post
out
there
it
was
there
his
honour
got
his
wound
you
mean
to
say
he
went
into
the
military
service
no
sir
he
served
in
the
civil
service
a
strange
thing
i
thought
meanwhile
we
had
reached
the
tavern
and
elisei
ran
on
in
front
to
announce
me
during
the
first
years
of
our
separation
pasinkov
and
i
had
written
to
each
other
pretty
often
but
his
last
letter
had
reached
me
four
years
before
and
since
then
i
had
heard
nothing
of
him
come
up
sir
elisei
shouted
to
me
from
the
staircase
ivanitch
is
very
anxious
to
see
you
i
ran
hurriedly
up
the
tottering
stairs
went
into
a
dark
little
room
and
my
heart
sank
on
a
narrow
bed
under
a
fur
cloak
pale
as
a
corpse
lay
pasinkov
and
he
was
stretching
out
to
me
a
bare
wasted
hand
i
rushed
up
to
him
and
embraced
him
passionately
i
cried
at
last
wrong
with
you
he
answered
in
a
faint
voice
a
bit
feeble
what
chance
brought
you
here
i
sat
down
on
a
chair
beside
pasinkov
bed
and
never
letting
his
hands
out
of
my
hands
i
began
gazing
into
his
face
i
recognised
the
features
i
loved
the
expression
of
the
eyes
and
the
smile
were
unchanged
but
what
a
wreck
illness
had
made
of
him
he
noticed
the
impression
he
was
making
on
me
three
days
since
i
shaved
he
observed
to
be
sure
not
been
combed
and
brushed
but
except
for
that
i
not
so
bad
me
please
yasha
i
began
this
elisei
been
telling
me
you
were
wounded
yes
it
quite
a
history
he
replied
tell
you
it
later
yes
i
was
wounded
and
only
fancy
what
by
an
arrow
arrow
an
arrow
only
not
a
mythological
one
not
cupid
arrow
but
a
real
arrow
of
very
flexible
wood
with
a
tip
at
one
end
a
very
unpleasant
sensation
is
produced
by
such
an
arrow
especially
when
it
sticks
in
one
lungs
however
did
it
come
about
upon
my
word
tell
you
how
it
happened
you
know
there
always
was
a
great
deal
of
the
absurd
in
my
life
do
you
remember
my
comical
correspondence
about
getting
my
passport
well
i
was
wounded
in
an
absurd
fashion
too
and
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
what
person
in
our
enlightened
century
would
permit
himself
to
be
wounded
by
an
arrow
and
not
accidentally
observe
not
at
sports
of
any
sort
but
in
a
battle
you
still
do
tell
me
right
wait
a
minute
he
interrupted
know
that
soon
after
you
left
petersburg
i
was
transferred
to
novgorod
i
was
a
good
time
at
novgorod
and
i
must
own
i
was
bored
there
though
even
there
i
came
across
one
creature
he
sighed
no
matter
about
that
now
two
years
ago
i
got
a
capital
little
berth
some
way
off
true
in
the
irkutsk
province
but
what
of
that
it
seems
as
though
my
father
and
i
were
destined
from
birth
to
visit
siberia
a
splendid
country
siberia
rich
fertile
every
one
will
tell
you
the
same
i
liked
it
very
much
there
the
natives
were
put
under
my
rule
they
a
harmless
lot
of
people
but
as
my
would
have
it
they
took
it
into
their
heads
a
dozen
of
them
not
more
to
smuggle
in
contraband
goods
i
was
sent
to
arrest
them
arrest
them
i
did
but
one
of
them
crazy
he
must
have
been
thought
fit
to
defend
himself
and
treated
me
to
the
arrow
i
almost
died
of
it
however
i
got
all
right
again
now
here
i
am
going
to
get
completely
cured
the
government
god
give
them
all
good
health
have
provided
the
cash
pasinkov
let
his
head
fall
back
on
the
pillow
exhausted
and
ceased
speaking
a
faint
flush
suffused
his
cheeks
he
closed
his
eyes
ca
talk
much
elisei
who
had
not
left
the
room
murmured
in
an
undertone
a
silence
followed
nothing
was
heard
but
the
sick
man
painful
breathing
here
he
went
on
opening
his
eyes
been
stopping
a
fortnight
in
this
little
town
i
caught
cold
i
suppose
the
district
doctor
here
is
attending
me
you
see
him
he
seems
to
know
his
business
i
awfully
glad
it
happened
so
though
or
how
should
we
have
met
and
he
took
my
hand
his
hand
which
had
just
before
been
cold
as
ice
was
now
burning
hot
me
something
about
yourself
he
began
again
throwing
the
cloak
back
off
his
chest
and
i
have
seen
each
other
since
god
knows
when
i
hastened
to
carry
out
his
wish
so
as
not
to
let
him
talk
and
started
giving
an
account
of
myself
he
listened
to
me
at
first
with
great
attention
then
asked
for
drink
and
then
began
closing
his
eyes
again
and
turning
his
head
restlessly
on
the
pillow
i
advised
him
to
have
a
little
nap
adding
that
i
should
not
go
on
further
till
he
was
well
again
and
that
i
should
establish
myself
in
a
room
beside
him
very
nasty
here
pasinkov
was
beginning
but
i
stopped
his
mouth
and
went
softly
out
elisei
followed
me
is
it
elisei
why
he
dying
is
he
i
questioned
the
faithful
servant
elisei
simply
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
and
turned
away
having
dismissed
my
driver
and
rapidly
moved
my
things
into
the
next
room
i
went
to
see
whether
pasinkov
was
asleep
at
the
door
i
ran
up
against
a
tall
man
very
fat
and
heavily
built
his
face
and
puffy
expressed
laziness
and
nothing
else
his
tiny
little
eyes
seemed
as
it
were
glued
up
and
his
lips
looked
polished
as
though
he
were
just
awake
me
to
ask
i
questioned
him
you
not
the
doctor
the
fat
man
looked
at
me
seeming
with
an
effort
to
lift
his
overhanging
forehead
with
his
eyebrows
sir
he
responded
at
last
me
the
favour
mr
doctor
wo
you
please
to
come
this
way
into
my
room
yakov
ivanitch
is
i
believe
now
asleep
i
am
a
friend
of
his
and
should
like
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
about
his
illness
which
makes
me
very
uneasy
good
answered
the
doctor
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
try
and
say
talk
so
much
i
have
come
anyway
and
he
followed
me
me
please
i
began
as
soon
as
he
had
dropped
into
a
chair
my
friend
condition
serious
what
do
you
think
answered
the
fat
man
tranquilly
is
it
very
serious
it
serious
that
he
may
even
die
may
i
confess
i
looked
almost
with
hatred
at
the
fat
man
heavens
i
began
must
take
some
steps
call
a
consultation
or
something
you
know
we
ca
mercy
on
us
consultation
quite
possible
why
not
it
possible
call
in
ivan
efremitch
the
doctor
spoke
with
difficulty
and
sighed
continually
his
stomach
heaved
perceptibly
when
he
spoke
as
it
were
emphasising
each
word
is
ivan
efremitch
parish
doctor
we
send
to
the
chief
town
of
the
province
what
do
you
think
there
are
sure
to
be
good
doctors
there
you
might
who
is
considered
the
best
doctor
there
best
there
was
a
doctor
kolrabus
there
only
i
fancy
he
been
transferred
somewhere
else
though
i
must
own
there
no
need
really
to
send
so
the
best
doctor
will
be
of
no
use
to
your
friend
is
he
so
bad
he
run
down
what
way
precisely
is
he
ill
received
a
wound
the
lungs
were
affected
in
consequence
and
then
he
taken
cold
too
and
fever
was
set
up
and
so
on
and
there
no
reserve
force
a
man
ca
get
on
you
know
yourself
with
no
reserve
force
we
were
both
silent
for
a
while
about
trying
homoeopathy
said
the
fat
man
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
me
why
you
an
allopath
are
you
of
that
do
you
think
i
do
understand
homoeopathy
i
understand
it
as
well
as
the
other
why
the
chemist
here
among
us
treats
people
homeopathically
and
he
has
no
learned
degree
whatever
i
thought
a
bad
doctor
i
observed
had
better
treat
him
according
to
your
usual
method
you
please
the
fat
man
got
up
and
heaved
a
sigh
are
going
to
him
asked
i
must
have
a
look
at
him
and
he
went
out
i
did
not
follow
him
to
see
him
at
the
bedside
of
my
poor
sick
friend
was
more
than
i
could
stand
i
called
my
man
and
gave
him
orders
to
drive
at
once
to
the
chief
town
of
the
province
to
inquire
there
for
the
best
doctor
and
to
bring
him
without
fail
there
was
a
slight
noise
in
the
passage
i
opened
the
door
quickly
the
doctor
was
already
coming
out
of
pasinkov
room
i
questioned
him
in
a
whisper
all
right
i
have
prescribed
a
mixture
have
decided
doctor
to
send
to
the
chief
town
i
have
no
doubt
of
your
skill
but
as
you
aware
two
heads
are
better
than
one
that
very
praiseworthy
responded
the
fat
man
and
he
began
to
descend
the
staircase
he
was
obviously
tired
of
me
i
went
in
to
pasinkov
you
seen
the
local
aesculapius
he
asked
i
answered
i
like
about
him
remarked
pasinkov
his
astounding
composure
a
doctor
ought
to
be
phlegmatic
ought
he
it
so
encouraging
for
the
patient
i
did
not
of
course
try
to
controvert
this
towards
the
evening
pasinkov
contrary
to
my
expectations
seemed
better
he
asked
elisei
to
set
the
samovar
announced
that
he
was
going
to
regale
me
with
tea
and
drink
a
small
cup
himself
and
he
was
noticeably
more
cheerful
i
tried
though
not
to
let
him
talk
and
seeing
that
he
would
not
be
quiet
i
asked
him
if
he
would
like
me
to
read
him
something
as
at
winterkeller
do
you
remember
he
answered
you
will
i
shall
be
delighted
what
shall
we
read
look
there
are
my
books
in
the
i
went
to
the
window
and
took
up
the
first
book
that
my
hand
chanced
upon
is
it
he
asked
lermontov
excellent
pushkin
is
greater
no
doubt
do
you
remember
once
more
the
gather
close
above
me
in
the
perfect
calm
or
for
the
last
time
thy
image
sweet
in
thought
i
dare
caress
ah
marvellous
marvellous
but
lermontov
fine
too
well
i
tell
you
what
dear
boy
you
take
the
book
open
it
by
chance
and
read
what
you
find
i
opened
the
book
and
was
disconcerted
i
had
chanced
upon
last
will
i
tried
to
turn
over
the
page
but
pasinkov
noticed
my
action
and
said
hurriedly
no
no
read
what
turned
up
there
was
no
getting
out
of
it
i
read
last
will
footnote
the
last
will
alone
with
thee
brother
i
would
wish
to
be
on
earth
so
they
tell
me
i
have
not
long
to
stay
soon
you
will
go
home
see
that
but
nay
for
my
fate
to
speak
the
truth
no
one
is
very
greatly
troubled
but
if
any
one
asks
well
whoever
may
ask
tell
them
that
through
the
breast
i
was
shot
by
a
bullet
that
i
died
honourably
for
the
tsar
that
our
doctors
are
not
much
good
and
that
to
my
native
land
i
send
a
humble
greeting
my
father
and
mother
hardly
will
you
find
living
i
own
i
should
be
sorry
that
they
should
grieve
for
me
thing
said
pasinkov
directly
i
had
finished
the
last
verse
thing
but
it
queer
he
added
after
a
brief
pause
queer
you
should
have
chanced
just
on
that
queer
i
began
to
read
another
poem
but
pasinkov
was
not
listening
to
me
he
looked
away
and
twice
he
repeated
again
i
let
the
book
drop
on
my
knees
there
is
a
girl
their
neighbour
he
whispered
and
turning
to
me
he
asked
say
do
you
remember
sophia
zlotnitsky
i
turned
red
should
think
i
did
was
married
i
suppose
asanov
long
long
ago
i
wrote
to
you
about
it
but
if
either
of
them
is
living
say
i
am
lazy
about
writing
that
our
regiment
has
been
sent
forward
and
that
they
must
not
expect
me
home
there
is
a
girl
their
neighbour
as
you
remember
it
long
since
we
parted
she
will
not
ask
for
me
all
the
same
you
tell
her
all
the
truth
do
spare
her
empty
heart
let
her
weep
a
little
it
will
not
hurt
her
much
be
sure
to
be
sure
so
you
did
did
her
father
forgive
her
in
the
end
forgave
her
but
he
would
not
receive
asanov
old
fellow
well
and
are
they
supposed
to
be
happy
do
know
really
i
fancy
they
happy
they
live
in
the
country
in
province
i
never
seen
them
though
i
have
been
through
their
parts
have
they
any
children
think
so
by
the
way
pasinkov
i
began
questioningly
he
glanced
at
me
do
you
remember
you
were
unwilling
to
answer
my
question
at
the
time
did
you
tell
her
i
cared
for
her
told
her
everything
the
whole
truth
i
always
told
her
the
truth
to
be
hypocritical
with
her
would
have
been
a
sin
pasinkov
was
silent
for
a
while
tell
me
he
began
again
you
soon
get
over
caring
for
her
or
not
very
soon
but
i
got
over
it
what
the
good
of
sighing
in
vain
pasinkov
turned
over
facing
me
i
brother
he
began
and
his
lips
were
quivering
no
match
for
you
there
i
not
got
over
caring
for
her
to
this
day
i
cried
in
indescribable
amazement
you
love
her
loved
her
said
pasinkov
slowly
and
he
put
both
hands
behind
his
head
i
loved
her
god
only
knows
i
never
spoken
of
it
to
any
one
to
any
one
in
the
world
and
i
never
meant
to
but
there
on
earth
so
they
tell
me
i
have
not
long
to
stay
what
does
it
matter
pasinkov
unexpected
avowal
so
utterly
astonished
me
that
i
could
positively
say
nothing
i
could
only
wonder
it
possible
how
was
it
i
never
suspected
it
he
went
on
as
though
speaking
to
himself
loved
her
i
never
ceased
to
love
her
even
when
i
knew
her
heart
was
asanov
but
how
bitter
it
was
for
me
to
know
that
if
she
had
loved
you
i
should
at
least
have
rejoiced
for
you
but
asanov
how
did
he
make
her
care
for
him
it
was
just
his
luck
and
change
her
feelings
cease
to
care
she
could
not
a
true
heart
does
not
change
i
recalled
asanov
visit
after
the
fatal
dinner
intervention
and
i
could
not
help
flinging
up
my
hands
in
astonishment
learnt
it
all
from
me
poor
fellow
i
cried
you
undertook
to
go
and
see
her
then
pasinkov
began
again
explanation
with
her
i
shall
never
forget
it
it
was
then
i
found
out
then
i
realised
the
meaning
of
the
word
i
had
chosen
for
myself
long
before
resignation
but
still
she
has
remained
my
constant
dream
my
ideal
and
he
to
be
pitied
who
lives
without
an
ideal
i
looked
at
pasinkov
his
eyes
fastened
as
it
were
on
the
distance
shone
with
feverish
brilliance
loved
her
he
went
on
loved
her
her
calm
true
unapproachable
incorruptible
when
she
went
away
i
was
almost
mad
with
grief
since
then
i
have
never
cared
for
any
and
suddenly
turning
he
pressed
his
face
into
the
pillow
and
began
quietly
weeping
i
jumped
up
bent
over
him
and
began
trying
to
comfort
him
no
matter
he
said
raising
his
head
and
shaking
back
his
hair
nothing
i
felt
a
little
bitter
a
little
sorry
for
myself
that
is
but
it
all
no
matter
it
all
the
fault
of
those
verses
read
me
something
else
more
cheerful
i
took
up
lermontov
and
began
hurriedly
turning
over
the
pages
but
as
fate
would
have
it
i
kept
coming
across
poems
likely
to
agitate
pasinkov
again
at
last
i
read
him
gifts
of
terek
rhetoric
said
my
poor
friend
with
the
tone
of
a
preceptor
there
are
fine
passages
since
i
saw
you
brother
i
tried
my
hand
at
poetry
and
began
one
poem
the
cup
of
life
but
it
come
off
it
for
us
brother
to
appreciate
not
to
create
but
i
rather
tired
i
sleep
a
little
what
do
you
say
what
a
splendid
thing
sleep
is
come
to
think
of
it
all
our
life
a
dream
and
the
best
thing
in
it
is
dreaming
too
poetry
i
queried
a
dream
too
but
a
dream
of
paradise
pasinkov
closed
his
eyes
i
stood
for
a
little
while
at
his
bedside
i
did
not
think
he
would
get
to
sleep
quickly
but
soon
his
breathing
became
more
even
and
prolonged
i
went
away
on
tiptoe
turned
into
my
own
room
and
lay
down
on
the
sofa
for
a
long
while
i
mused
on
what
pasinkov
had
told
me
recalled
many
things
wondered
at
last
i
too
fell
asleep
some
one
touched
me
i
started
up
before
me
stood
elisei
in
to
my
master
he
said
i
got
up
at
once
the
matter
with
him
delirious
and
has
it
ever
been
so
before
with
him
he
was
delirious
last
night
too
only
it
is
something
terrible
i
went
to
pasinkov
room
he
was
not
lying
down
but
sitting
up
in
bed
his
whole
body
bent
forward
he
was
slowly
gesticulating
with
his
hands
smiling
and
talking
talking
all
the
time
in
a
weak
hollow
voice
like
the
whispering
of
rushes
his
eyes
were
wandering
the
gloomy
light
of
a
night
light
set
on
the
floor
and
shaded
off
by
a
book
lay
an
unmoving
patch
on
the
ceiling
pasinkov
face
seemed
paler
than
ever
in
the
half
darkness
i
went
up
to
him
called
him
by
his
name
he
did
not
answer
i
began
listening
to
his
whispering
he
was
talking
of
siberia
of
its
forests
from
time
to
time
there
was
sense
in
his
ravings
trees
he
whispered
up
to
the
sky
what
frost
on
them
silver
snowdrifts
and
here
are
little
tracks
that
a
hare
leaping
that
a
white
weasel
no
it
my
father
running
with
my
papers
here
he
is
here
he
is
must
go
the
moon
is
shining
must
go
look
for
my
papers
ah
a
flower
a
crimson
flower
there
sophia
oh
the
bells
are
ringing
the
frost
is
crackling
ah
no
it
the
stupid
bullfinches
hopping
in
the
bushes
whistling
see
the
redthroats
cold
ah
asanov
oh
yes
of
course
he
a
cannon
a
copper
cannon
and
his
is
green
that
how
it
is
he
liked
is
it
a
star
has
fallen
no
it
an
arrow
flying
ah
how
quickly
and
straight
into
my
heart
who
shot
it
you
sonitchka
he
bent
his
head
and
began
muttering
disconnected
words
i
glanced
at
elisei
he
was
standing
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
gazing
ruefully
at
his
master
brother
so
you
become
a
practical
person
eh
he
asked
suddenly
turning
upon
me
such
a
clear
such
a
fully
conscious
glance
that
i
could
not
help
starting
and
was
about
to
reply
but
he
went
on
at
once
i
brother
have
not
become
a
practical
person
i
have
and
that
all
about
it
a
dreamer
i
was
born
a
dreamer
dreaming
dreaming
what
is
dreaming
sobakevitch
peasant
dreaming
ugh
almost
till
morning
pasinkov
wandered
in
delirium
at
last
he
gradually
grew
quieter
sank
back
on
the
pillow
and
dozed
off
i
went
back
into
my
room
worn
out
by
the
cruel
night
i
slept
soundly
elisei
again
waked
me
sir
he
said
in
a
shaking
voice
do
believe
yakov
ivanitch
is
dying
i
ran
in
to
pasinkov
he
was
lying
motionless
in
the
light
of
the
coming
day
he
looked
already
a
corpse
he
recognised
me
he
whispered
her
for
me
i
dying
i
cried
you
are
going
to
live
no
i
am
dying
here
take
this
as
a
keepsake
he
pointed
to
his
breast
this
he
began
suddenly
the
sea
all
golden
and
blue
isles
upon
it
marble
temples
incense
he
ceased
speaking
stretched
within
half
an
hour
he
was
no
more
elisei
flung
himself
weeping
at
his
feet
i
closed
his
eyes
on
his
neck
there
was
a
little
silken
amulet
on
a
black
cord
i
took
it
three
days
afterwards
he
was
buried
one
of
the
noblest
hearts
was
hidden
for
ever
in
the
grave
i
myself
threw
the
first
handful
of
earth
upon
him
iii
another
year
and
a
half
passed
by
business
obliged
me
to
visit
moscow
i
took
up
my
quarters
in
one
of
the
good
hotels
there
one
day
as
i
was
passing
along
the
corridor
i
glanced
at
the
with
the
list
of
visitors
staying
in
the
hotel
and
almost
cried
out
aloud
with
astonishment
opposite
the
number
stood
distinctly
written
in
chalk
the
name
sophia
nikolaevna
asanova
of
late
i
had
chanced
to
hear
a
good
deal
that
was
bad
about
her
husband
i
had
learned
that
he
was
addicted
to
drink
and
to
gambling
had
ruined
himself
and
was
generally
misconducting
himself
his
wife
was
spoken
of
with
respect
in
some
excitement
i
went
back
to
my
room
the
passion
that
had
long
long
ago
grown
cold
began
as
it
were
to
stir
within
my
heart
and
it
throbbed
i
resolved
to
go
and
see
sophia
nikolaevna
a
long
time
has
passed
since
the
day
we
parted
i
thought
has
most
likely
forgotten
everything
there
was
between
us
in
those
days
i
sent
elisei
whom
i
had
taken
into
my
service
after
the
death
of
pasinkov
with
my
to
her
door
and
told
him
to
inquire
whether
she
was
at
home
and
whether
i
might
see
her
elisei
quickly
came
back
and
announced
that
sophia
nikolaevna
was
at
home
and
would
see
me
i
went
at
once
to
sophia
nikolaevna
when
i
went
in
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
taking
leave
of
a
tall
stout
gentleman
you
like
he
was
saying
in
a
rich
mellow
voice
is
not
a
harmless
person
he
a
useless
person
and
every
useless
person
in
a
society
is
harmful
harmful
harmful
with
those
words
the
tall
gentleman
went
out
sophia
nikolaevna
turned
to
me
long
it
is
since
we
met
she
said
down
please
we
sat
down
i
looked
at
her
to
see
again
after
long
absence
the
features
of
a
face
once
dear
perhaps
beloved
to
recognise
them
and
not
recognise
them
as
though
across
the
old
unforgotten
countenance
a
new
one
like
but
strange
were
looking
out
at
one
instantaneously
almost
unconsciously
to
note
the
traces
time
has
laid
upon
it
all
this
is
rather
melancholy
too
must
have
changed
in
the
same
way
each
is
inwardly
thinking
sophia
nikolaevna
did
not
however
look
much
older
though
when
i
had
seen
her
last
she
was
sixteen
and
that
was
nine
years
ago
her
features
had
become
still
more
correct
and
severe
as
of
old
they
expressed
sincerity
of
feeling
and
firmness
but
in
place
of
her
former
serenity
a
sort
of
secret
ache
and
anxiety
could
be
discerned
in
them
her
eyes
had
grown
deeper
and
darker
she
had
begun
to
show
a
likeness
to
her
mother
sophia
nikolaevna
was
the
first
to
begin
the
conversation
are
both
changed
she
began
have

all
this
time

rolling
stone

said
in
a
rather
hurried
voice

always
very
fond
of
horses

know
and
he

that
account
he

now
at
that
instant
there
walked
into
the
room
a
little
girl
of
eight
years
old
with
her
hair
in
a
pigtail
with
a
very
keen
and
lively
little
face
and
large
dark
grey
eyes
on
seeing
me
she
at
once
drew
back
her
little
foot
dropped
a
hasty
curtsey
and
went
up
to
sophia
nikolaevna
is
my
little
daughter

me
introduce
her
to

said
sophia
nikolaevna

finger

little
girl

stop
at
home
she
persuaded
me
to
bring
her
with
me
the
little
girl
scanned
me
with
her
rapid
glance
and
faintly
dropped
her
eyelids
is
a
capital
little
person
sophia
nikolaevna
went
on
nothing
she
afraid
of
and
she
good
at
her
lessons
i
must
say
that

her

an
undertone

over
to

little
girl
glanced
at
me
again

face

konstantin
alexandritch
i
was
going
on
yes
sophia
nikolaevna
interposed
while
her
little
daughter
kept
her
attentive
eyes
fastened
upon
her
husband
of
course
he
is
very
fond
of
children
a
strange
expression
flitted
across
lidia
clever
little
face
there
was
a
slight
pout
about
her
lips
she
hung
her
head
me
sophia
nikolaevna
added
hurriedly

expect

enfant

te
dirai

sophia
nikolaevna
smiled
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
me
please
sophia
nikolaevna
began
again
you
remember
you
had
a
friend
what
was
his
name
he
had
such
a
face
he
was
always
reading
poetry
such
an
enthusiastic
pasinkov
yes

now

dead
repeated
sophia
nikolaevna
a
pity
i
seen
him
the
little
girl
asked
in
a
hurried
whisper
lidia
you
never
seen
what
a
pity
repeated
sophia
nikolaevna
regret
him
i
began
if
you
had
known
him
as
i
knew
him
but
why
did
you
speak
of
him
may
i
ask
i
do
know
sophia
nikolaevna
dropped
her
eyes
she
added
away
to
your
nurse
call
me
when
i
may
come
back
asked
the
little
girl
the
little
girl
went
away
sophia
nikolaevna
turned
to
me
me
please
all
you
know
about
pasinkov
i
began
telling
her
his
story
i
sketched
in
brief
words
the
whole
life
of
my
friend
tried
as
far
as
i
was
able
to
give
an
idea
of
his
soul
described
his
last
meeting
with
me
and
his
end
a
man
like
that
i
cried
as
i
finished
my
story
left
us
unnoticed
almost
unappreciated
but
that
no
great
loss
what
is
the
use
of
man
appreciation
what
pains
me
what
wounds
me
is
that
such
a
man
with
such
a
loving
and
devoted
heart
is
dead
without
having
once
known
the
bliss
of
love
returned
without
having
awakened
interest
in
one
woman
heart
worthy
of
him
such
as
i
may
well
know
nothing
of
such
happiness
we
do
deserve
it
but
pasinkov
and
yet
have
i
met
thousands
of
men
in
my
life
who
could
not
compare
with
him
in
any
respect
who
were
loved
must
one
believe
that
some
faults
in
a
man
conceit
for
instance
or
frivolity
are
essential
to
gain
a
woman
devotion
or
does
love
fear
perfection
the
perfection
possible
on
earth
as
something
strange
and
terrible
sophia
nikolaevna
heard
me
to
the
end
without
taking
her
stern
searching
eyes
off
me
without
moving
her
lips
only
her
eyebrows
contracted
from
time
to
time
makes
you
suppose
she
observed
after
a
brief
silence
no
woman
ever
loved
your
friend
i
know
it
know
it
for
a
fact
sophia
nikolaevna
seemed
about
to
say
something
but
she
stopped
she
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
herself
are
mistaken
she
began
at
last
know
a
woman
who
loved
your
dead
friend
passionately
she
loves
him
and
remembers
him
to
this
day
and
the
news
of
his
death
will
be
a
fearful
blow
for
her
is
this
woman
may
i
know
sister
varia
nikolaevna
i
cried
in
amazement
varvara
nikolaevna
i
repeated
will
finish
your
sentence
sophia
nikolaevna
took
me
up
girl
you
thought
so
cold
so
listless
and
indifferent
loved
your
friend
that
is
why
she
has
never
married
and
never
will
marry
till
this
day
no
one
has
known
of
this
but
me
varia
would
die
before
she
would
betray
her
secret
in
our
family
we
know
how
to
suffer
in
silence
i
looked
long
and
intently
at
sophia
nikolaevna
involuntarily
pondering
on
the
bitter
significance
of
her
last
words
have
surprised
me
i
observed
at
last
do
you
know
sophia
nikolaevna
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
recalling
disagreeable
memories
i
might
surprise
you
too
do
understand
you
she
rejoined
slowly
and
with
some
embarrassment
certainly
do
understand
me
i
said
hastily
getting
up
so
allow
me
instead
of
verbal
explanation
to
send
you
something
what
is
it
she
inquired
be
alarmed
sophia
nikolaevna
it
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
bowed
and
went
back
to
my
room
took
out
the
little
silken
bag
i
had
taken
off
pasinkov
and
sent
it
to
sophia

confessed

the

timofeitch
of
his

when
he
went

twice
he
did

then
he
wrote

he
did
wish
it

sister
but
afterwards
mother
was
cross
with
me
and
my
sister
was
crowded
up
too
she
has
a
lot
of
children
and
so
i
moved
i
always
rested
my
hopes
on
yakov
ivanitch
and
longed
for
nothing
but
to
see
him
and
he
was
always
good
to
me

took
several
letters
out
of
her
pocket
and
handed
them
to
me
them
she
added
i
opened
one
letter
and
recognised
pasinkov
hand
masha
he
wrote
in
large
distinct
letters
leaned
your
little
head
against
my
head
yesterday
and
when
i
asked
why
you
do
so
you
told
me
i
want
to
hear
what
you
are
thinking
i
tell
you
what
i
was
thinking
i
was
thinking
how
nice
it
would
be
for
masha
to
learn
to
read
and
write
she
could
make
out
this
letter
masha
glanced
at
the
letter
he
wrote
me
in
novgorod
she
observed
he
was
just
going
to
teach
me
to
read
look
at
the
others
there
one
from
siberia
here
read
this
i
read
the
letters
they
were
very
affectionate

tender
in
one
of
them
the
first
one
from
siberia
pasinkov
called
masha
his
best
friend
promised
to
send
her
the
money
for
the
journey
to
siberia
and
ended
with
the
following
words
kiss
your
pretty
little
hands
the
girls

not
hands
like
yours
and
their
heads
are
no
match
for
yours
nor
their
hearts

gave
you
and
think
of
me
and
i
not

the
only

cared
for
me
and
so
i
want
to
belong

he
was
very
much
attached
to
you
i
said

the
letters
back
to
her

very
fond
of
me
replied
masha
putting
the
letters
carefully
into
her
pocket
and
the
tears
flowed
slowly
down
her
cheeks
always
trusted
in
him
if
the
lord
had
vouchsafed
him
long
life
he
would
not
have
abandoned
me
god
grant
him
his
heavenly
peace
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
a
corner
of
her
kerchief

i
inquired

came
here

place

poor

yakov
ivanitch
used
often
to
talk
of

she
added
getting
up
and
bowing
always
loved
you
and
thought
of

faltering

from
pasinkov

words
what

friend
of
his
i
was
wo

small
sum
masha
glanced
at
me
she
asked

masha
flushed
all
over
and
hung
her
head

murmured

but

stranger

accept
this
from
me
in
memory
of
our
friend
i
turned
away
hurriedly
pulled
a
few
notes
out
of
my
and
handed
them
to
her
masha
was
standing
motionless
her
head
still
more
downcast
it
i
persisted
she
slowly
raised
her
eyes
to
me
looked
me
in
the
face
mournfully
slowly
drew
her
pale
hand
from
under
her
kerchief
and
held
it
out
to
me
i
laid
the
notes
in
her
cold
fingers
without
a
word
she
hid
the
hand
again
under
her
kerchief
and
dropped
her
eyes
future

petrovna
i
resumed

be
in
want
of
anything

directly
to
me

will
give
you
my
address
humbly
thank
you
she
said
and
after
a
short
pause
she
added
did
not
speak
to
you
of
me
only
met
him
the
day
before
his
death
maria
petrovna
but
i
not
sure
i
believe
he
did
say
something
masha
passed
her
hand
over
her
hair
pressed
her
cheek
lightly
thought
a
moment
and
saying
walked
out
of
the
room
i
sat
at
the
table
and
fell
into
bitter
musings
this
masha
her
relations
with
pasinkov
his
letters
the
hidden
love
of
sophia
nikolaevna
sister
for
him
fellow
poor
fellow
i
whispered
with
a
catching
in
my
breath
i
thought
of
all
life
his
childhood
his
youth
fräulein
frederike
i
thought
fate
gave
to
thee
much
cause
for
joy
next
day
i
went
again
to
see
sophia
nikolaevna
i
was
kept
waiting
in
the
and
when
i
entered
lidia
was
already
seated
by
her
mother
i
understood
that
sophia
nikolaevna
did
not
wish
to
renew
the
conversation
of
the
previous
day
we
began
to
talk
i
really
do
remember
what
about
about
the
news
of
the
town
public
affairs
lidia
often
put
in
her
little
word
and
looked
slily
at
me
an
amusing
air
of
importance
had
suddenly
become
apparent
on
her
mobile
little
visage
the
clever
little
girl
must
have
guessed
that
her
mother
had
intentionally
stationed
her
at
her
side
i
got
up
and
began
taking
leave
sophia
nikolaevna
conducted
me
to
the
door
made
you
no
answer
yesterday
she
said
standing
still
in
the
doorway
indeed
what
answer
was
there
to
make
our
life
is
not
in
our
own
hands
but
we
all
have
one
anchor
from
which
one
can
never
without
one
own
will
be
torn
a
sense
of
duty
without
a
word
i
bowed
my
head
in
sign
of
assent
and
parted
from
the
youthful
puritan
all
that
evening
i
stayed
at
home
but
i
did
not
think
of
her
i
kept
thinking
and
thinking
of
my
dear
pasinkov
the
last
of
the
idealists
and
emotions
mournful
and
tender
pierced
with
sweet
anguish
into
my
soul
rousing
echoes
on
the
strings
of
a
heart
not
yet
quite
grown
old
peace
to
your
ashes
unpractical
man
idealist
and
god
grant
to
all
practical
men
to
whom
you
were
always
incomprehensible
and
who
perhaps
will
laugh
even
now
over
you
in
the
grave
god
grant
to
them
to
experience
even
a
hundredth
part
of
those
pure
delights
in
which
in
spite
of
fate
and
men
your
poor
and
unambitious
life
was
so
rich
andrei
kolosov
in
a
small
decently
furnished
room
several
young
men
were
sitting
before
the
fire
the
winter
evening
was
only
just
beginning
the
samovar
was
boiling
on
the
table
the
conversation
had
hardly
taken
a
definite
turn
but
passed
lightly
from
one
subject
to
another
they
began
discussing
exceptional
people
and
in
what
way
they
differed
from
ordinary
people
every
one
expounded
his
views
to
the
best
of
his
abilities
they
raised
their
voices
and
began
to
be
noisy
a
small
pale
man
after
listening
long
to
the
disquisitions
of
his
companions
sipping
tea
and
smoking
a
cigar
the
while
suddenly
got
up
and
addressed
us
all
i
was
one
of
the
disputants
in
the
following
words
all
your
profound
remarks
are
excellent
in
their
own
way
but
unprofitable
every
one
as
usual
hears
his
opponent
views
and
every
one
retains
his
own
convictions
but
it
not
the
first
time
we
have
met
nor
the
first
time
we
have
argued
and
so
we
have
probably
by
now
had
ample
opportunity
for
expressing
our
own
views
and
learning
those
of
others
why
then
do
you
take
so
much
trouble
uttering
these
words
the
small
man
carelessly
flicked
the
ash
off
his
cigar
into
the
fireplace
dropped
his
eyelids
and
smiled
serenely
we
all
ceased
speaking
what
are
we
to
do
then
according
to
you
said
one
of
us
cards
or
what
go
to
sleep
break
up
and
go
home
cards
is
agreeable
and
sleep
always
salutary
retorted
the
small
man
it
early
yet
to
break
up
and
go
home
you
understand
me
though
listen
i
propose
if
it
comes
to
that
that
each
of
you
should
describe
some
exceptional
personality
tell
us
of
any
meeting
you
may
have
had
with
any
remarkable
man
i
can
assure
you
even
the
feeblest
description
has
far
more
sense
in
it
than
the
finest
argument
we
pondered
a
strange
thing
observed
one
of
us
an
inveterate
jester
myself
i
do
know
a
single
exceptional
person
and
with
my
life
you
are
all
i
fancy
familiar
already
however
if
you
insist
cried
another
do
but
i
tell
you
what
he
added
addressing
the
small
man
begin
you
have
put
a
stopper
on
all
of
us
you
the
person
to
fill
the
gap
only
mind
if
we
do
care
for
your
story
we
shall
hiss
you
you
like
answered
the
small
man
he
stood
close
to
the
fire
we
sat
round
him
and
kept
quiet
the
small
man
looked
at
all
of
us
glanced
at
the
ceiling
and
began
as
follows
years
ago
my
dear
friends
i
was
a
student
at
moscow
my
father
a
virtuous
landowner
of
the
steppes
had
handed
me
over
to
a
retired
german
professor
who
for
a
hundred
roubles
a
month
undertook
to
lodge
and
board
me
and
to
watch
over
my
morals
this
german
was
the
fortunate
possessor
of
an
exceedingly
solemn
and
decorous
manner
at
first
i
went
in
considerable
awe
of
him
but
on
returning
home
one
evening
i
saw
with
indescribable
emotion
my
preceptor
sitting
with
three
or
four
companions
at
a
round
table
on
which
there
stood
a
collection
of
empty
bottles
and
glasses
on
seeing
me
my
revered
preceptor
got
up
and
waving
his
arms
and
stammering
presented
me
to
the
honourable
company
who
all
promptly
offered
me
a
glass
of
punch
this
agreeable
spectacle
had
a
most
illuminating
effect
on
my
intelligence
my
future
rose
before
me
in
the
most
seductive
images
and
as
a
fact
from
that
memorable
day
i
enjoyed
unbounded
freedom
and
all
but
worried
my
preceptor
to
death
he
had
a
wife
who
always
smelt
of
smoke
and
pickled
cucumbers
she
was
still
youngish
but
had
not
a
single
front
tooth
in
her
head
all
german
women
as
we
know
very
quickly
lose
those
indispensable
ornaments
of
the
human
frame
i
mention
her
solely
because
she
fell
passionately
in
love
with
me
and
fed
me
almost
into
my
grave
the
point
to
the
point
we
shouted
it
not
your
own
adventures
you
going
to
tell
us
gentlemen
the
small
man
replied
composedly
am
an
ordinary
mortal
and
so
i
lived
at
my
german
as
the
saying
is
in
clover
i
did
not
attend
lectures
with
too
much
assiduity
while
at
home
i
did
positively
nothing
in
a
very
short
time
i
had
got
to
know
all
my
comrades
and
was
on
intimate
terms
with
all
of
them
among
my
new
friends
was
one
rather
decent
and
fellow
the
son
of
a
town
provost
on
the
retired
list
his
name
was
bobov
this
bobov
got
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
see
me
and
seemed
to
like
me
i
too
do
you
know
i
did
like
him
nor
dislike
him
i
was
more
or
less
indifferent
i
must
tell
i
had
in
all
moscow
a
single
relation
except
an
old
uncle
who
used
sometimes
to
ask
me
for
money
i
never
went
anywhere
and
was
particularly
afraid
of
women
i
also
avoided
all
acquaintance
with
the
parents
of
my
college
friends
ever
after
one
such
parent
in
my
presence
pulled
his
son
hair
because
a
button
was
off
his
uniform
while
at
the
very
time
i
had
more
than
six
buttons
on
my
whole
coat
in
comparison
with
many
of
my
comrades
i
passed
for
being
a
person
of
wealth
my
father
used
to
send
me
every
now
and
then
small
packets
of
faded
blue
notes
and
consequently
i
not
only
enjoyed
a
position
of
independence
but
i
was
continually
surrounded
by
toadies
and
flatterers
what
am
i
saying
why
for
that
matter
so
was
my
bobtail
dog
armishka
who
in
spite
of
his
setter
pedigree
was
so
frightened
of
a
shot
that
the
very
sight
of
a
gun
reduced
him
to
indescribable
misery
like
every
young
man
however
i
was
not
without
that
vague
inward
fermentation
which
usually
after
bringing
forth
a
dozen
more
or
less
shapeless
poems
passes
off
in
a
peaceful
and
propitious
manner
i
wanted
something
strove
towards
something
and
dreamed
of
something
i
own
i
did
know
precisely
what
it
was
i
dreamed
of
now
i
understand
what
was
lacking
i
felt
my
loneliness
thirsted
for
the
society
of
live
people
the
word
life
waked
echoes
in
my
heart
and
with
a
vague
ache
i
listened
to
the
sound
of
it
valerian
nikitich
pass
me
a
cigarette
lighting
the
cigarette
the
small
man
continued
fine
morning
bobov
came
running
to
me
out
of
breath
do
you
know
old
man
the
great
news
kolosov
has
arrived
kolosov
and
who
on
earth
is
mr
kolosov
you
do
know
him
andriusha
kolosov
come
old
boy
let
go
to
him
directly
he
came
back
last
night
from
a
holiday
engagement
but
what
sort
of
fellow
is
he
an
exceptional
man
my
boy
let
me
assure
you
an
exceptional
man
i
answered
then
you
go
alone
i
stop
at
home
i
know
your
exceptional
men
a
rhymester
with
an
everlastingly
ecstatic
smile
oh
no
kolosov
not
like
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
observing
that
it
was
for
kolosov
to
call
on
me
but
i
do
know
why
i
obeyed
bobov
and
went
bobov
conducted
me
to
one
of
the
very
dirtiest
crookedest
and
narrowest
streets
in
moscow
the
house
in
which
kolosov
lodged
was
built
in
the
style
rambling
and
uncomfortable
we
went
into
the
courtyard
a
fat
peasant
woman
was
hanging
out
clothes
on
a
line
stretched
from
the
house
to
the
fence
children
were
squalling
on
the
wooden
staircase
on
get
on
we
objected
plaintively
see
gentlemen
you
do
care
for
the
agreeable
and
cling
solely
to
the
profitable
as
you
please
we
groped
our
way
through
a
dark
and
narrow
passage
to
kolosov
room
we
went
in
you
have
most
likely
an
approximate
idea
of
what
a
poor
student
room
is
like
directly
facing
the
door
kolosov
was
sitting
on
a
chest
of
drawers
smoking
a
pipe
he
gave
his
hand
to
bobov
in
a
friendly
way
and
greeted
me
affably
i
looked
at
kolosov
and
at
once
felt
irresistibly
drawn
to
him
gentlemen
bobov
was
right
kolosov
really
was
a
remarkable
person
let
me
describe
a
little
more
in
detail
he
was
rather
tall
slender
graceful
and
exceedingly
his
face
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
describe
his
face
it
is
easy
to
describe
all
the
features
one
by
one
but
how
is
one
to
convey
to
any
one
else
what
constitutes
the
distinguishing
characteristic
the
essence
of
just
face
byron
calls
the
music
of
the
face
observed
a
tightly
pallid
gentleman
so
and
therefore
i
will
confine
myself
to
a
single
remark
the
especial
something
to
which
i
have
just
referred
consisted
in
kolosov
case
in
a
carelessly
gay
and
fearless
expression
of
face
and
also
in
an
exceedingly
captivating
smile
he
did
not
remember
his
parents
and
had
had
a
wretched
in
the
house
of
a
distant
relative
who
had
been
degraded
from
the
service
for
taking
bribes
up
to
the
age
of
fifteen
he
had
lived
in
the
country
then
he
found
his
way
into
moscow
and
after
two
years
spent
in
the
care
of
an
old
deaf
priest
wife
he
entered
the
university
and
began
to
get
his
living
by
lessons
he
gave
instruction
in
history
geography
and
russian
grammar
though
he
had
only
a
dim
notion
of
these
branches
of
science
but
in
the
first
place
there
is
an
abundance
of
among
us
in
russia
of
the
greatest
usefulness
to
teachers
and
secondly
the
requirements
of
the
respectable
merchants
who
confided
their
children
education
to
kolosov
were
exceedingly
limited
kolosov
was
neither
a
wit
nor
a
humorist
but
you
can
not
imagine
how
readily
we
all
fell
under
that
fellow
sway
we
felt
a
sort
of
instinctive
admiration
of
him
his
words
his
looks
his
gestures
were
all
so
full
of
the
charm
of
youth
that
all
his
comrades
were
head
over
ears
in
love
with
him
the
professors
considered
him
as
a
fairly
intelligent
lad
but
no
marked
abilities
and
lazy
kolosov
presence
gave
a
special
harmony
to
our
evening
reunions
before
him
our
liveliness
never
passed
into
vulgar
riotousness
if
we
were
all
melancholy
this
half
childlike
melancholy
in
his
presence
led
on
to
quiet
sometimes
fairly
sensible
conversation
and
never
ended
in
dejected
boredom
you
are
smiling
gentlemen
i
understand
your
smile
no
doubt
many
of
us
since
then
have
turned
out
pretty
cads
but
youth
youth
talk
not
to
me
of
a
name
great
in
story
the
days
of
our
youth
are
the
days
of
our
glory
commented
the
same
pallid
gentleman
jove
what
a
memory
he
got
and
all
from
byron
observed
the
storyteller
one
word
kolosov
was
the
soul
of
our
set
i
was
attached
to
him
by
a
feeling
stronger
than
any
i
have
ever
felt
for
any
woman
and
yet
i
do
feel
ashamed
even
now
to
remember
that
strange
love
yes
love
it
was
for
i
recollect
i
went
through
at
that
time
all
the
tortures
of
that
passion
jealousy
for
instance
kolosov
liked
us
all
equally
but
was
particularly
friendly
with
a
silent
and
unobtrusive
youth
called
gavrilov
from
gavrilov
he
was
almost
inseparable
he
would
often
speak
to
him
in
a
whisper
and
used
to
disappear
with
him
out
of
moscow
no
one
knew
where
for
two
or
three
days
at
a
time
kolosov
did
not
care
to
be
questioned
and
i
was
lost
in
surmises
it
was
not
simple
curiosity
that
disturbed
me
i
longed
to
become
the
friend
the
attendant
squire
of
kolosov
i
was
jealous
of
gavrilov
i
envied
him
i
could
never
find
an
explanation
to
satisfy
me
of
kolosov
strange
absences
meanwhile
he
had
none
of
that
air
of
mysteriousness
about
him
which
is
the
proud
possession
of
youths
endowed
with
vanity
pallor
black
hair
and
eyes
nor
had
he
anything
of
that
studied
carelessness
under
which
we
are
given
to
understand
that
vast
forces
are
slumbering
no
he
was
quite
open
and
free
but
when
he
was
possessed
by
passion
an
intense
impulsive
energy
was
apparent
in
everything
about
him
only
he
did
not
waste
his
energies
in
vain
and
never
under
any
circumstances
became
or
affected
by
the
way
tell
me
the
truth
has
it
happened
to
you
to
sit
smoking
a
pipe
with
an
air
of
as
weary
solemnity
as
if
you
had
just
resolved
on
a
grand
achievement
while
you
were
simply
pondering
on
what
colour
to
choose
for
your
next
pair
of
trousers
but
the
point
is
that
i
was
the
first
to
observe
in
kolosov
always
cheerful
and
friendly
as
he
was
these
instinctive
passionate
impulses
they
may
well
say
that
love
is
penetrating
i
made
up
my
mind
at
all
hazards
to
get
into
his
confidence
it
was
no
use
for
me
to
lay
myself
out
to
please
kolosov
i
had
such
a
childlike
adoration
for
him
that
he
could
have
no
doubt
of
my
devotion
but
to
my
indescribable
vexation
i
had
at
last
to
yield
to
the
conviction
that
kolosov
avoided
closer
intimacy
with
me
that
he
was
as
it
were
oppressed
by
my
uninvited
attachment
once
when
with
obvious
displeasure
he
asked
me
to
lend
him
money
the
very
next
day
he
returned
me
the
loan
with
ironical
gratitude
during
the
whole
winter
my
relations
with
kolosov
were
utterly
unchanged
i
often
compared
myself
with
gavrilov
and
could
not
make
out
in
what
respect
he
was
better
than
i
but
suddenly
everything
was
changed
in
the
middle
of
april
gavrilov
fell
ill
and
died
in
the
arms
of
kolosov
who
never
left
his
room
for
an
instant
and
went
nowhere
for
a
whole
week
afterwards
we
were
all
grieved
for
poor
gavrilov
the
pale
silent
lad
seemed
to
have
had
a
foreboding
of
his
end
i
too
grieved
sincerely
for
him
but
my
heart
ached
with
expectation
of
something
one
ever
memorable
evening
i
was
alone
lying
on
the
sofa
gazing
idly
at
the
ceiling
some
one
rapidly
opened
the
door
of
my
room
and
stood
still
in
the
doorway
i
raised
my
head
before
me
stood
kolosov
he
slowly
came
in
and
sat
down
beside
me
have
come
to
you
he
began
in
a
rather
thick
voice
you
care
more
for
me
than
any
of
the
others
do
i
have
lost
my
best
friend
his
voice
shook
a
little
i
feel
lonely
none
of
you
knew
gavrilov
none
of
you
knew
he
got
up
paced
up
and
down
the
room
came
rapidly
towards
me
again
you
take
his
place
he
said
and
gave
me
his
hand
i
leaped
up
and
flung
myself
on
his
breast
my
genuine
delight
touched
him
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
i
was
choking
kolosov
looked
at
me
and
softly
laughed
we
had
tea
at
tea
he
talked
of
gavrilov
i
heard
that
that
timid
gentle
boy
had
saved
life
and
i
could
not
but
own
to
myself
that
in
gavrilov
place
i
could
have
resisted
chattering
about
it
boasting
of
my
luck
it
struck
eight
kolosov
got
up
went
to
the
window
drummed
on
the
panes
turned
swiftly
round
to
me
tried
to
say
something
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
without
a
word
i
took
his
hand
truly
truly
i
deserve
your
confidence
he
looked
straight
into
my
eyes
if
so
he
brought
out
at
last
your
cap
and
come
along
to
did
not
ask
me
i
was
silent
at
once
you
play
at
cards
we
went
out
took
a
cab
to
one
of
the
gates
of
the
town
at
the
gate
we
got
out
kolosov
went
on
in
front
very
quickly
i
followed
him
we
walked
along
the
highroad
after
we
had
gone
of
a
mile
kolosov
turned
off
meanwhile
night
had
come
on
on
the
right
in
the
fog
were
the
twinkling
lights
the
innumerable
of
the
immense
city
on
the
left
two
white
horses
were
grazing
in
a
meadow
skirting
the
forest
before
us
stretched
fields
covered
with
greyish
mists
i
followed
kolosov
in
silence
he
stopped
all
at
once
stretched
his
hand
out
in
front
of
him
and
said
this
is
where
we
are
going
i
saw
a
small
dark
house
two
little
windows
showed
a
dim
light
in
the
fog
this
house
kolosov
went
on
a
man
called
sidorenko
a
retired
lieutenant
with
his
sister
an
old
maid
and
his
daughter
i
shall
pass
you
off
as
a
relation
of
mine
you
must
sit
down
and
play
at
cards
with
him
i
nodded
without
a
word
i
wanted
to
show
kolosov
that
i
could
be
as
silent
as
gavrilov
but
i
will
own
i
was
suffering
agonies
of
curiosity
as
we
went
up
to
the
steps
of
the
house
i
caught
sight
at
a
lighted
window
of
the
slender
figure
of
a
girl
she
seemed
waiting
for
us
and
vanished
at
once
we
went
into
a
dark
and
narrow
passage
a
crooked
hunchback
old
woman
came
to
meet
us
and
looked
at
me
with
astonishment
ivan
semyonitch
at
home
inquired
kolosov
is
at
is
at
home
called
a
deep
masculine
voice
from
within
we
went
into
the
if
one
can
call
the
long
rather
dirty
room
a
small
old
piano
huddled
unassumingly
in
a
corner
beside
the
stove
a
few
chairs
stood
out
along
the
walls
which
had
once
been
yellow
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
tall
stooping
man
of
fifty
in
a
greasy
i
looked
at
him
more
attentively
a
morose
looking
countenance
hair
standing
up
like
a
brush
a
low
forehead
grey
eyes
immense
whiskers
thick
lips
nice
customer
i
thought
a
longish
time
since
we
seen
you
andrei
nikolaevitch
he
observed
holding
out
his
hideous
red
hand
longish
time
it
is
and
sevastian
sevastianovitch
is
dead
answered
kolosov
mournfully
you
do
say
so
and
who
this
relation
i
have
the
honour
to
present
to
you
nikolai
alexei
right
all
right
ivan
semyonitch
cut
him
short
delighted
and
does
he
play
cards
of
course
he
does
then
that
capital
we
sit
down
directly
hey
matrona
semyonovna
where
are
you
the
quick
and
tea
with
these
words
sidorenko
walked
into
the
next
room
kolosov
looked
at
me
he
said
think
how
ashamed
i
am
i
shut
him
up
you
there
your
name
this
way
called
ivan
semyonitch
i
went
into
the
the
was
even
smaller
than
the
on
the
walls
hung
some
monstrosities
of
portraits
in
front
of
the
sofa
of
which
the
stuffing
protruded
in
several
places
stood
a
green
table
on
the
sofa
sat
ivan
semyonitch
already
shuffling
the
cards
near
him
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
low
chair
sat
a
spare
woman
in
a
white
cap
and
a
black
gown
yellow
and
wrinkled
with
eyes
and
thin
lips
said
ivan
semyonitch
me
introduce
him
the
first
man
dead
andrei
nikolaevitch
has
brought
us
another
let
see
how
he
plays
the
old
lady
bowed
awkwardly
and
cleared
her
throat
i
looked
round
kolosov
was
no
longer
in
the
room
that
coughing
matrona
semyonovna
sheep
cough
grumbled
sidorenko
i
sat
down
the
game
began
sidorenko
got
fearfully
hot
and
furious
at
my
slightest
mistake
he
pelted
his
sister
with
abusive
epithets
but
she
had
apparently
had
time
to
get
used
to
her
amenities
and
only
blinked
in
response
but
when
he
announced
to
matrona
semyonovna
that
she
was
the
poor
old
woman
fired
up
semyonitch
she
protested
with
heat
were
the
death
of
your
wife
anfisa
karpovna
but
you
sha
worry
me
into
my
grave
you
sha
you
sha
they
kept
it
up
in
this
fashion
for
some
time
my
position
was
as
you
perceive
not
merely
an
unenviable
one
it
was
positively
idiotic
i
conceive
what
had
induced
kolosov
to
bring
me
i
have
never
been
a
good
but
on
that
occasion
i
was
aware
myself
that
i
was
playing
excruciatingly
badly
the
retired
lieutenant
repeated
continually
you
ca
hold
a
candle
to
sevastianovitch
no
you
play
carelessly
i
you
may
be
sure
was
inwardly
wishing
him
at
the
devil
this
torture
continued
for
two
hours
they
beat
me
hollow
before
the
end
of
the
last
rubber
i
heard
a
slight
sound
behind
my
chair
i
looked
round
and
saw
kolosov
beside
him
stood
a
girl
of
seventeen
who
was
watching
me
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
me
my
pipe
varia
muttered
ivan
semyonitch
the
girl
promptly
flew
off
into
the
other
room
she
was
not
very
pretty
rather
pale
rather
thin
but
never
before
or
since
have
i
seen
such
hair
such
eyes
we
finished
the
rubber
somehow
i
paid
up
sidorenko
lighted
his
pipe
and
grumbled
now
it
time
for
supper
kolosov
presented
me
to
varia
that
is
to
varvara
ivanovna
the
daughter
of
ivan
semyonitch
varia
was
embarrassed
i
too
was
embarrassed
but
in
a
few
minutes
kolosov
as
usual
had
got
everything
and
everyone
into
full
swing
he
sat
varia
down
to
the
piano
begged
her
to
play
a
dance
tune
and
proceeded
to
dance
a
cossack
dance
in
competition
with
ivan
semyonitch
the
lieutenant
uttered
little
shrieks
stamped
and
cut
such
incredible
capers
that
even
matrona
semyonovna
burst
out
laughing
and
retreated
to
her
own
room
upstairs
the
hunchback
old
woman
laid
the
table
we
sat
down
to
supper
at
supper
kolosov
told
all
sorts
of
nonsensical
stories
the
lieutenant
guffaws
were
deafening
i
peeped
from
under
my
eyelids
at
varia
she
never
took
her
eyes
off
kolosov
and
from
the
expression
of
her
face
alone
i
could
divine
that
she
both
loved
him
and
was
loved
by
him
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
her
head
bent
a
little
forward
a
faint
colour
kept
flitting
across
her
whole
face
from
time
to
time
she
sighed
deeply
suddenly
dropped
her
eyes
and
softly
laughed
to
herself
i
rejoiced
for
kolosov
but
at
the
same
time
deuce
take
it
i
was
envious
after
supper
kolosov
and
i
promptly
took
up
our
caps
which
did
not
however
prevent
the
lieutenant
from
saying
with
a
yawn
paid
us
a
long
visit
gentlemen
it
time
to
say
varia
accompanied
kolosov
into
the
passage
are
you
coming
andrei
nikolaevitch
she
whispered
to
him
a
few
days
for
certain
him
too
she
added
with
a
very
sly
smile
course
of
course
humble
servant
thought
i
on
the
way
home
i
heard
the
following
story
six
months
before
kolosov
had
become
acquainted
with
sidorenko
in
a
rather
queer
way
one
rainy
evening
kolosov
was
returning
home
from
shooting
and
had
reached
the
gate
of
the
city
when
suddenly
at
no
great
distance
from
the
highroad
he
heard
groans
interspersed
with
curses
he
had
a
gun
without
thinking
long
he
made
straight
for
the
sound
and
found
a
man
lying
on
the
ground
with
a
dislocated
ankle
this
man
was
sidorenko
with
great
difficulty
he
got
him
home
handed
him
over
to
the
care
of
his
frightened
sister
and
his
daughter
and
ran
for
the
doctor
meantime
it
was
nearly
morning
kolosov
was
almost
dropping
with
fatigue
with
the
permission
of
matrona
semyonovna
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
parlour
and
slept
till
eight
on
waking
up
he
would
at
once
have
gone
home
but
they
kept
him
and
gave
him
some
tea
in
the
night
he
had
twice
succeeded
in
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
pale
face
of
varvara
ivanovna
he
had
not
particularly
noticed
her
but
in
the
morning
she
made
a
decidedly
agreeable
impression
on
him
matrona
semyonovna
garrulously
praised
and
thanked
kolosov
varvara
sat
silent
pouring
out
the
tea
glanced
at
him
now
and
then
and
with
timid
attentiveness
handed
him
first
a
cup
of
tea
then
the
cream
then
the
meanwhile
the
lieutenant
waked
up
loudly
called
for
his
pipe
and
after
a
short
pause
bawled
hi
sister
matrona
semyonovna
went
to
his
bedroom
about
that
what
the
devil
his
name
is
he
gone
i
still
here
answered
kolosov
going
up
to
the
door
you
better
now
answered
the
lieutenant
in
here
my
good
sir
kolosov
went
in
sidorenko
looked
at
him
and
reluctantly
observed
thanks
come
sometimes
and
see
me
what
your
name
who
the
devil
to
know
answered
andrei
well
come
and
see
us
but
it
no
use
your
sticking
on
here
now
i
daresay
they
expecting
you
at
home
kolosov
retreated
said
to
matrona
semyonovna
bowed
to
varvara
ivanovna
and
returned
home
from
that
day
he
began
to
visit
ivan
semyonitch
at
first
at
long
intervals
then
more
and
more
frequently
the
summer
came
on
he
would
sometimes
take
his
gun
put
on
his
knapsack
and
set
off
as
if
he
were
going
shooting
he
would
go
to
the
retired
lieutenant
and
stay
on
there
till
evening
varvara
ivanovna
father
had
served
years
in
the
army
had
saved
a
small
sum
of
money
and
bought
himself
a
few
acres
of
land
a
mile
and
a
half
from
moscow
he
could
scarcely
read
and
write
but
in
spite
of
his
external
clumsiness
and
coarseness
he
was
shrewd
and
cunning
and
even
on
occasion
capable
of
sharp
practice
like
many
little
russians
he
was
a
fearful
egoist
obstinate
as
an
ox
and
in
general
exceedingly
impolite
especially
with
strangers
i
even
detected
in
him
something
like
a
contempt
for
the
whole
human
race
he
indulged
himself
in
every
caprice
like
a
spoilt
child
would
know
no
one
and
lived
for
his
own
pleasure
we
were
once
somehow
or
other
talking
about
marriages
with
him
marriage
said
he
the
devil
would
i
let
my
daughter
marry
eh
what
should
i
do
it
for
for
her
husband
to
knock
her
about
as
i
used
to
my
wife
besides
whom
should
i
be
left
with
such
was
the
retired
lieutenant
ivan
semyonitch
kolosov
used
to
go
and
see
him
not
on
his
account
of
course
but
for
the
sake
of
his
daughter
one
fine
evening
andrei
was
sitting
in
the
garden
with
her
chatting
about
something
ivan
semyonitch
went
up
to
him
looked
sullenly
at
varia
and
called
andrei
away
my
dear
fellow
he
said
to
him
find
it
good
fun
i
see
gossiping
with
my
only
child
but
i
dull
in
my
old
age
bring
some
one
with
you
or
i
nobody
to
deal
a
card
to
d
hear
i
sha
give
admittance
to
you
by
yourself
the
next
day
kolosov
turned
up
with
gavrilov
and
poor
sevastian
sevastianovitch
had
for
a
whole
autumn
and
winter
been
playing
cards
in
the
evenings
with
the
retired
lieutenant
that
worthy
treated
him
without
ceremony
as
it
is
called
in
other
words
fearfully
rudely
you
now
probably
realise
why
it
was
that
after
gavrilov
death
kolosov
took
me
with
him
to
ivan
semyonitch
as
he
communicated
all
these
details
kolosov
added
love
varia
she
is
the
dearest
girl
she
liked
you
i
have
forgotten
i
fancy
to
make
known
to
you
that
up
to
that
time
i
had
been
afraid
of
women
and
avoided
them
though
i
would
sometimes
in
solitude
spend
whole
hours
in
dreaming
of
tender
interviews
of
love
of
mutual
love
and
so
on
varvara
ivanovna
was
the
first
girl
with
whom
i
was
forced
to
talk
by
necessity
by
necessity
it
really
was
varia
was
an
ordinary
girl
and
yet
there
are
very
few
such
girls
in
holy
russia
you
will
ask
me
why
so
because
i
never
noticed
in
her
anything
strained
unnatural
affected
because
she
was
a
simple
candid
rather
melancholy
creature
because
one
could
never
call
her
young
lady
i
liked
her
soft
smile
i
liked
her
ringing
little
voice
her
light
and
mirthful
laugh
her
attentive
though
by
no
means
glances
the
child
promised
nothing
but
you
could
not
help
admiring
her
as
you
admire
the
sudden
soft
cry
of
the
oriole
at
evening
in
the
lofty
dark
i
must
confess
that
at
the
present
time
i
should
pass
by
such
a
creature
with
some
indifference
i
no
taste
now
for
solitary
evening
strolls
and
orioles
but
in
those
days
i
no
doubt
gentlemen
that
like
all
persons
you
have
been
in
love
at
least
once
in
the
course
of
your
life
and
have
learnt
from
your
own
experience
how
love
springs
up
and
develops
in
the
human
heart
and
therefore
i
not
going
to
enlarge
too
much
on
what
took
place
with
me
at
that
time
kolosov
and
i
used
to
go
pretty
often
to
ivan
semyonitch
and
though
those
damned
cards
often
drove
me
to
utter
despair
still
in
the
mere
proximity
of
the
woman
one
loves
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
varia
there
is
a
sort
of
strange
sweet
tormenting
joy
i
made
no
effort
to
suppress
this
growing
feeling
besides
by
the
time
i
had
at
last
brought
myself
to
call
the
emotion
by
its
true
name
it
was
already
too
strong
i
cherished
my
love
in
silence
and
jealously
and
shyly
concealed
it
i
myself
enjoyed
this
agonising
ferment
of
silent
passion
my
sufferings
did
not
rob
me
of
my
sleep
nor
of
my
appetite
but
for
whole
days
together
i
was
conscious
of
that
peculiar
physical
sensation
in
my
breast
which
is
a
symptom
of
the
presence
of
love
i
am
incapable
of
depicting
the
conflict
of
various
sensations
which
took
place
within
me
when
for
example
kolosov
came
in
from
the
garden
with
varia
and
her
whole
face
was
aglow
with
ecstatic
devotion
exhaustion
from
excess
of
bliss
she
so
completely
lived
in
his
life
was
so
completely
taken
up
with
him
that
unconsciously
she
adopted
his
ways
looked
as
he
looked
laughed
as
he
laughed
i
can
imagine
the
moments
she
passed
with
andrei
the
raptures
she
owed
to
him
while
he
kolosov
did
not
lose
his
freedom
in
her
absence
he
did
not
i
suppose
even
think
of
her
he
was
still
the
same
unconcerned
gay
and
happy
fellow
we
had
always
known
him
and
as
i
have
already
told
you
we
used
kolosov
and
i
to
go
pretty
often
to
ivan
semyonitch
sometimes
when
he
was
out
of
humour
the
retired
lieutenant
did
not
make
me
sit
down
to
cards
on
such
occasions
he
would
shrink
into
a
corner
in
silence
scowling
and
looking
crossly
at
every
one
the
first
time
i
was
delighted
at
his
letting
me
off
so
easily
but
afterwards
i
would
sometimes
begin
myself
begging
him
to
sit
down
to
whist
the
part
of
third
person
was
so
insupportable
i
was
so
unpleasantly
in
kolosov
and
varia
way
though
they
did
assure
each
other
that
there
was
no
need
to
mind
me
meanwhile
time
went
on
they
were
happy
i
have
no
great
fondness
for
describing
other
people
happiness
but
then
i
began
to
notice
that
varia
childish
ecstasy
had
gradually
given
way
to
a
more
womanly
more
restless
feeling
i
began
to
surmise
that
the
new
song
was
being
sung
to
the
old
tune
that
is
that
kolosov
was
little
by
little
cooling
this
discovery
i
must
own
delighted
me
i
did
not
feel
i
must
confess
the
slightest
indignation
against
andrei
the
intervals
between
our
visits
became
longer
and
longer
varia
began
to
meet
us
with
eyes
reproaches
were
heard
sometimes
i
asked
kolosov
with
affected
indifference
shall
we
go
to
ivan
semyonitch
he
looked
coldly
at
me
and
answered
quietly
we
not
going
i
sometimes
fancied
that
he
smiled
slily
when
he
spoke
to
me
of
varia
i
failed
generally
to
fill
gavrilov
place
with
him
gavrilov
was
a
thousand
times
more
and
foolish
than
i
now
allow
me
a
slight
digression
when
i
spoke
of
my
university
comrades
i
did
not
mention
a
certain
shtchitov
he
was
he
had
been
a
student
for
ten
years
already
i
can
see
even
now
his
rather
long
pale
face
his
little
brown
eyes
his
long
hawk
nose
crooked
at
the
end
his
thin
sarcastic
lips
his
solemn
upstanding
shock
of
hair
and
his
chin
that
lost
itself
complacently
in
the
wide
striped
cravat
of
the
colour
of
a
raven
wing
the
shirt
front
with
bronze
buttons
the
open
blue
and
striped
waistcoat
i
can
hear
his
unpleasantly
jarring
laugh
he
went
everywhere
was
conspicuous
at
all
possible
kinds
of
classes
i
remember
i
could
not
listen
to
his
cynical
stories
without
a
peculiar
shudder
kolosov
once
compared
him
to
an
unswept
russian
refreshment
bar
a
horrible
comparison
and
with
all
that
there
was
a
lot
of
intelligence
common
sense
observation
and
wit
in
the
man
he
sometimes
impressed
us
by
some
saying
so
apt
so
true
and
cutting
that
we
were
all
involuntarily
reduced
to
silence
and
looked
at
him
with
amazement
but
to
be
sure
it
is
just
the
same
to
a
russian
whether
he
has
uttered
an
absurdity
or
a
clever
thing
shtchitov
was
especially
dreaded
by
those
dreamy
and
not
particularly
gifted
youths
who
spend
whole
days
in
painfully
hatching
a
dozen
trashy
lines
of
verse
and
reading
them
in
to
their
and
who
despise
every
sort
of
positive
science
one
such
he
simply
drove
out
of
moscow
by
continually
repeating
to
him
two
of
his
own
lines
yet
all
the
while
shtchitov
himself
did
nothing
and
learnt
nothing
but
that
all
in
the
natural
order
of
things
well
shtchitov
god
only
knows
why
began
jeering
at
my
romantic
attachment
to
kolosov
the
first
time
with
noble
indignation
i
told
him
to
go
to
the
devil
the
second
time
with
chilly
contempt
i
informed
him
that
he
was
not
capable
of
judging
of
our
friendship
but
i
did
not
send
him
away
and
when
on
taking
leave
of
me
he
observed
that
without
kolosov
permission
i
did
even
dare
to
praise
him
i
felt
annoyed
shtchitov
last
words
sank
into
my
for
more
than
a
fortnight
i
had
not
seen
varia
pride
love
a
vague
anticipation
a
number
of
different
feelings
were
astir
within
me
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
a
fearful
sinking
at
my
heart
i
set
off
alone
to
ivan
semyonitch
i
do
know
how
i
made
my
way
to
the
familiar
little
house
i
remember
i
sat
down
several
times
by
the
road
to
rest
not
from
fatigue
but
from
emotion
i
went
into
the
passage
and
had
not
yet
had
time
to
utter
a
single
word
when
the
door
of
the
flew
open
and
varia
ran
to
meet
me
last
she
said
in
a
quavering
voice
andrei
nikolaevitch
has
not
come
i
muttered
with
an
effort
come
she
repeated
he
told
me
to
tell
you
that
he
was
detained
i
positively
did
not
know
what
i
was
saying
and
i
did
not
dare
to
raise
my
eyes
varia
stood
silent
and
motionless
before
me
i
glanced
at
her
she
turned
away
her
head
two
big
tears
rolled
slowly
down
her
cheeks
in
the
expression
of
her
face
there
was
such
sudden
bitter
suffering
the
conflict
between
bashfulness
sorrow
and
confidence
in
me
was
so
simply
so
touchingly
apparent
in
the
unconscious
movement
of
her
poor
little
head
that
it
sent
a
pang
to
my
heart
i
bent
a
little
forward
she
gave
a
hurried
start
and
ran
away
in
the
parlour
i
was
met
by
ivan
semyonitch
this
my
good
sir
are
you
alone
he
asked
me
with
a
queer
twitch
of
his
left
eyelid
i
come
alone
i
stammered
sidorenko
went
off
into
a
sudden
guffaw
and
departed
into
the
next
room
i
had
never
been
in
such
a
foolish
position
it
was
too
devilishly
disgusting
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
i
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
was
the
fat
pig
laughing
at
i
wondered
matrona
semyonovna
came
into
the
room
with
a
stocking
in
her
hands
and
sat
down
in
the
window
i
began
talking
to
her
meanwhile
tea
was
brought
in
varia
came
downstairs
pale
and
sorrowful
the
retired
lieutenant
made
jokes
about
kolosov
know
said
he
sort
of
customer
he
is
you
could
tempt
him
here
with
lollipops
now
i
expect
varia
hurriedly
got
up
and
went
away
ivan
semyonitch
looked
after
her
and
gave
a
sly
whistle
i
glanced
at
him
in
perplexity
it
be
i
wondered
he
knows
all
about
it
and
the
lieutenant
as
though
divining
my
thoughts
nodded
his
head
affirmatively
directly
after
tea
i
got
up
and
took
leave
my
good
sir
we
shall
see
again
observed
the
lieutenant
i
did
not
say
a
word
in
reply
i
began
to
feel
simply
frightened
of
the
man
on
the
steps
a
cold
and
trembling
hand
clutched
at
mine
i
looked
round
varia
must
speak
to
you
she
whispered
rather
earlier
straight
into
the
garden
after
dinner
papa
is
asleep
no
one
will
interfere
with
us
i
pressed
her
hand
without
a
word
and
we
parted
next
day
at
three
in
the
afternoon
i
was
in
ivan
garden
in
the
morning
i
had
not
seen
kolosov
though
he
had
come
to
see
me
it
was
a
grey
autumn
day
but
soft
and
warm
delicate
yellow
blades
of
grass
nodded
over
the
blanching
turf
the
nimble
tomtits
were
hopping
about
the
bare
twigs
some
belated
larks
were
hurriedly
running
about
the
paths
a
hare
was
creeping
cautiously
about
among
the
greens
a
herd
of
cattle
wandered
lazily
over
the
stubble
i
found
varia
in
the
garden
under
the
on
the
little
she
was
wearing
a
dark
dress
rather
creased
her
weary
eyes
the
dejected
droop
of
her
hair
seemed
to
express
genuine
suffering
i
sat
down
beside
her
we
were
both
silent
for
a
long
while
she
kept
twisting
a
twig
in
her
hand
she
bent
her
head
and
uttered
nikolaevitch
i
noticed
at
once
by
the
twitching
of
her
lips
that
she
was
getting
ready
to
cry
and
began
consoling
her
assuring
her
hotly
of
andrei
devotion
she
heard
me
nodded
her
head
mournfully
articulated
some
indistinct
words
and
then
was
silent
but
did
not
cry
the
first
moments
i
had
dreaded
most
of
all
had
gone
off
fairly
well
she
began
little
by
little
to
talk
about
andrei
know
that
he
does
not
love
me
now
she
repeated
be
with
him
i
imagine
how
i
am
to
live
without
him
i
do
sleep
at
nights
i
keep
weeping
what
am
i
to
do
what
am
i
to
do
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
thought
him
so
kind
and
here
varia
wiped
her
eyes
cleared
her
throat
and
sat
up
seems
such
a
little
while
ago
she
went
on
was
reading
to
me
out
of
pushkin
sitting
with
me
on
this
bench
varia
naïve
communicativeness
touched
me
i
listened
in
silence
to
her
confessions
my
soul
was
slowly
filled
with
a
bitter
torturing
bliss
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
that
pale
face
those
long
wet
eyelashes
and
rather
parched
lips
and
meanwhile
i
felt
would
you
care
to
hear
a
slight
psychological
analysis
of
my
emotions
at
that
moment
in
the
first
place
i
was
tortured
by
the
thought
that
it
was
not
i
that
was
loved
not
i
that
as
making
varia
suffer
secondly
i
was
delighted
at
her
confidence
i
knew
she
would
be
grateful
to
me
for
giving
her
an
opportunity
of
expressing
her
sorrow
thirdly
i
was
inwardly
vowing
to
myself
to
bring
kolosov
and
varia
together
again
and
was
deriving
consolation
from
the
consciousness
of
my
magnanimity
in
the
fourth
place
i
hoped
by
my
to
touch
varia
heart
and
then
you
see
i
do
not
spare
myself
no
thank
god
it
high
time
but
from
the
of
the
monastery
near
it
struck
five
the
evening
was
coming
on
rapidly
varia
got
up
hastily
thrust
a
little
note
into
my
hand
and
went
off
towards
the
house
i
overtook
her
promised
to
bring
andrei
to
her
and
stealthily
like
a
happy
lover
crept
out
by
the
little
gate
into
the
field
on
the
note
was
written
in
an
unsteady
hand
the
words
to
andrei
nikolaevitch
next
day
i
set
off
early
in
the
morning
to
kolosov
i
bound
to
confess
that
although
i
assured
myself
that
my
intentions
were
not
only
honourable
but
positively
brimful
of
i
was
yet
conscious
of
a
certain
awkwardness
even
timidity
i
arrived
at
kolosov
there
was
with
him
a
fellow
called
puzyritsin
a
former
student
who
had
never
taken
his
degree
one
of
those
authors
of
sensational
novels
of
the
or
school
puzyritsin
was
a
very
and
shy
person
and
was
always
preparing
to
be
an
hussar
in
spite
of
his
years
he
belonged
to
that
class
of
people
who
feel
it
absolutely
necessary
once
in
the
hours
to
utter
a
phrase
after
the
pattern
of
beautiful
always
falls
into
decay
in
the
flower
of
its
splendour
such
is
the
fate
of
the
beautiful
in
the
world
in
order
to
smoke
his
pipe
with
redoubled
zest
all
the
rest
of
the
day
in
a
circle
of
comrades
on
this
account
he
was
called
an
idealist
well
so
puzyritsin
was
sitting
with
kolosov
reading
him
some
i
began
to
listen
it
was
all
about
a
youth
who
loves
a
maiden
kills
her
and
so
on
at
last
puzyritsin
finished
and
retreated
his
absurd
production
solemnly
bawling
voice
his
presence
altogether
had
put
kolosov
into
a
mood
of
sarcastic
irritability
i
felt
that
i
had
come
at
an
unlucky
moment
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
it
without
any
kind
of
preface
i
handed
andrei
varia
note
kolosov
looked
at
me
in
perplexity
tore
open
the
note
ran
his
eyes
over
it
said
nothing
but
smiled
composedly
ho
he
said
at
last
you
been
at
ivan
semyonitch
i
was
there
yesterday
alone
i
answered
abruptly
and
resolutely
observed
kolosov
ironically
and
he
lighted
his
pipe
i
said
to
him
you
sorry
for
her
if
you
had
seen
her
tears
and
i
launched
into
an
eloquent
description
of
my
visit
of
the
previous
day
i
was
genuinely
moved
kolosov
did
not
speak
and
smoked
his
pipe
sat
with
her
under
the
in
the
garden
he
said
at
last
remember
in
may
i
too
used
to
sit
with
her
on
that
seat
the
was
in
blossom
the
fresh
white
flowers
fell
upon
us
sometimes
i
held
both
varia
hands
we
were
happy
then
now
the
is
over
and
the
apples
on
the
tree
are
sour
i
flew
into
a
passion
of
noble
indignation
began
reproaching
andrei
for
coldness
for
cruelty
argued
with
him
that
he
had
no
right
to
abandon
a
girl
so
suddenly
after
awakening
in
her
a
multitude
of
new
emotions
i
begged
him
at
least
to
go
and
say
to
varia
kolosov
heard
me
to
the
end
he
said
to
me
when
agitated
and
exhausted
i
flung
myself
into
an
armchair
you
as
my
friend
may
be
allowed
to
criticise
me
but
hear
my
defence
at
least
though
here
he
paused
for
a
little
while
and
smiled
curiously
an
excellent
girl
he
went
on
has
done
me
no
wrong
whatever
on
the
contrary
i
am
greatly
very
greatly
indebted
to
her
i
have
left
off
going
to
see
her
for
a
very
simple
reason
i
have
left
off
caring
for
her
why
why
i
interrupted
him
knows
why
while
i
loved
her
i
was
entirely
hers
i
never
thought
of
the
future
and
everything
my
whole
life
i
shared
with
her
now
this
passion
has
died
out
in
me
well
you
would
tell
me
to
be
a
humbug
to
play
at
being
in
love
would
you
but
what
for
from
pity
for
her
if
she
a
decent
girl
she
wo
care
for
such
charity
herself
but
if
she
is
glad
to
be
consoled
by
my
my
sympathy
well
she
not
good
for
much
kolosov
carelessly
offhand
expressions
offended
me
perhaps
the
more
because
they
were
applied
to
the
woman
with
whom
i
was
secretly
in
love
i
fired
up
i
said
to
him
i
know
why
you
have
given
up
going
to
see
varia
has
forbidden
you
to
in
uttering
these
words
i
fancied
i
was
dealing
a
most
cutting
blow
at
andrei
taniusha
was
a
very
young
lady
dark
free
in
her
manners
and
devilishly
clever
a
shtchitov
in
petticoats
kolosov
quarrelled
with
her
and
made
it
up
again
half
a
dozen
times
in
a
month
she
was
passionately
fond
of
him
though
sometimes
during
their
misunderstandings
she
would
vow
and
declare
that
she
thirsted
for
his
blood
and
andrei
too
could
not
get
on
without
her
kolosov
looked
at
me
and
responded
serenely
so
perhaps
so
i
shouted
certainly
kolosov
at
last
got
sick
of
my
reproaches
he
got
up
and
put
on
his
cap
are
you
going
a
walk
you
and
puzyritsin
have
given
me
a
headache
between
you
are
angry
with
me
he
answered
smiling
his
sweet
smile
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
me
anyway
what
do
you
wish
me
to
tell
varia
he
thought
a
little
told
you
he
said
we
had
read
pushkin
together
remind
her
of
one
line
of
pushkin
line
what
line
i
asked
impatiently
one
what
has
been
will
not
be
again
with
those
words
he
went
out
of
the
room
i
followed
him
on
the
stairs
he
stopped
is
she
very
much
upset
he
asked
me
pulling
his
cap
over
his
eyes
very
much
thing
console
her
nikolai
you
love
her
you
know
i
have
grown
fond
of
her
certainly
love
her
repeated
kolosov
and
he
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
i
turned
away
without
a
word
and
we
separated
on
reaching
home
i
was
in
a
perfect
fever
have
done
my
duty
i
thought
have
overcome
my
own
egoism
i
have
urged
andrei
to
go
back
to
varia
now
i
am
in
the
right
he
that
will
not
when
he
may
at
the
same
time
andrei
indifference
wounded
me
he
had
not
been
jealous
of
me
he
told
me
to
console
her
but
is
varia
such
an
ordinary
girl
is
she
not
even
worthy
of
sympathy
there
are
people
who
know
how
to
appreciate
what
you
despise
andrei
nikolaitch
but
what
the
good
she
does
not
love
me
no
she
does
not
love
me
now
while
she
has
not
quite
lost
hope
of
kolosov
return
but
afterwards
who
knows
my
devotion
will
touch
her
i
will
make
no
claims
i
will
give
myself
up
to
her
wholly
irrevocably
varia
is
it
possible
you
will
not
love
me
never
never
such
were
the
speeches
your
humble
servant
was
rehearsing
in
the
city
of
moscow
in
the
year
in
the
house
of
his
revered
preceptor
i
wept
i
felt
faint
the
weather
was
horrible
a
fine
rain
trickled
down
the
window
panes
with
a
persistent
thin
little
patter
damp
hung
stationary
over
the
town
i
dined
hurriedly
made
no
response
to
the
anxious
inquiries
of
the
kind
german
woman
who
whimpered
a
little
herself
at
the
sight
of
my
red
swollen
eyes
germans
as
is
well
known
are
always
glad
to
weep
i
behaved
very
ungraciously
to
my
preceptor
and
at
once
after
dinner
set
off
to
ivan
semyonitch
bent
double
in
a
jolting
droshky
i
kept
asking
myself
whether
i
should
tell
varia
all
as
it
was
or
go
on
deceiving
her
and
little
by
little
turn
her
heart
from
andrei
i
reached
ivan
semyonitch
without
knowing
what
to
decide
upon
i
found
all
the
family
in
the
parlour
on
seeing
me
varia
turned
fearfully
white
but
did
not
move
from
her
place
sidorenko
began
talking
to
me
in
a
peculiarly
jeering
way
i
responded
as
best
i
could
looking
from
time
to
time
at
varia
and
almost
unconsciously
giving
a
dejected
and
pensive
expression
to
my
features
the
lieutenant
started
whist
again
varia
sat
near
the
window
and
did
not
stir
dull
now
i
suppose
ivan
semyonitch
asked
her
twenty
times
over
at
last
i
succeeded
in
seizing
a
favourable
opportunity
are
alone
again
varia
whispered
to
me
i
answered
gloomily
probably
for
long
she
swiftly
drew
in
her
head
you
give
him
my
letter
she
asked
in
a
voice
hardly
audible
she
gasped
for
breath
i
glanced
at
her
there
was
a
sudden
flash
of
spiteful
pleasure
within
me
told
me
to
tell
you
i
pronounced
deliberately
what
has
been
will
not
be
again
varia
pressed
her
left
hand
to
her
heart
stretched
her
right
hand
out
in
front
staggered
and
went
quickly
out
of
the
room
i
tried
to
overtake
her
ivan
semyonitch
stopped
me
i
stayed
another
two
hours
with
him
but
varia
did
not
appear
on
the
way
back
i
felt
ashamed
ashamed
before
varia
before
andrei
before
myself
though
they
say
it
is
better
to
cut
off
an
injured
limb
at
once
than
to
keep
the
patient
in
prolonged
suffering
but
who
gave
me
a
right
to
deal
such
a
merciless
blow
at
the
heart
of
a
poor
girl
for
a
long
while
i
could
not
sleep
but
i
fell
asleep
at
last
in
general
i
must
repeat
that
never
once
deprived
me
of
sleep
i
began
to
go
pretty
often
to
ivan
semyonitch
i
used
to
see
kolosov
as
before
but
neither
he
nor
i
ever
referred
to
varia
my
relations
with
her
were
of
a
rather
curious
kind
she
became
attached
to
me
with
that
sort
of
attachment
which
excludes
every
possibility
of
love
she
could
not
help
noticing
my
warm
sympathy
and
talked
eagerly
with
me
of
what
do
you
suppose
of
kolosov
nothing
but
kolosov
the
man
had
taken
such
possession
of
her
that
she
did
not
as
it
were
belong
to
herself
i
tried
in
vain
to
arouse
her
pride
she
was
either
silent
or
if
she
talked
chattered
on
about
kolosov
i
did
not
even
suspect
in
those
days
that
sorrow
of
that
kind
talkative
sorrow
is
in
reality
far
more
genuine
than
any
silent
suffering
i
must
own
i
passed
many
bitter
moments
at
that
time
i
was
conscious
that
i
was
not
capable
of
filling
kolosov
place
i
was
conscious
that
varia
past
was
so
full
so
rich
and
her
present
so
poor
i
got
to
the
point
of
an
involuntary
shudder
at
the
words
you
with
which
almost
every
sentence
of
hers
began
she
grew
a
little
thinner
during
the
first
days
of
our
acquaintance
but
afterwards
got
better
again
and
even
grew
cheerful
she
might
have
been
compared
then
with
a
wounded
bird
not
yet
quite
recovered
meanwhile
my
position
had
become
insupportable
the
lowest
passions
gradually
gained
possession
of
my
soul
it
happened
to
me
to
slander
kolosov
in
presence
i
resolved
to
cut
short
such
unnatural
relations
but
how
part
from
varia
i
could
not
declare
my
love
to
her
i
did
not
dare
i
felt
that
i
could
not
as
yet
hope
for
a
return
marry
her
this
idea
alarmed
me
i
was
only
eighteen
i
felt
a
dread
of
putting
all
my
future
into
bondage
so
early
i
thought
of
my
father
i
could
hear
the
jeering
comments
of
kolosov
comrades
but
they
say
every
thought
is
like
dough
you
have
only
to
knead
it
well
you
can
make
anything
you
like
of
it
i
began
for
whole
days
together
to
dream
of
marriage
i
imagined
what
gratitude
would
fill
varia
heart
when
i
the
friend
and
confidant
of
kolosov
should
offer
her
my
hand
knowing
her
to
be
hopelessly
in
love
with
another
persons
of
experience
i
remembered
had
told
me
that
marriage
for
love
is
a
complete
absurdity
i
began
to
indulge
my
fancy
i
pictured
to
myself
our
peaceful
life
together
in
some
snug
corner
of
south
russia
an
mentally
i
traced
the
gradual
transition
in
varia
heart
from
gratitude
to
affection
from
affection
to
love
i
vowed
to
myself
at
once
to
leave
moscow
the
university
to
forget
everything
and
every
one
i
began
to
avoid
meeting
kolosov
at
last
one
bright
winter
day
varia
had
been
somehow
peculiarly
enchanting
the
previous
evening
i
dressed
myself
in
my
best
slowly
and
solemnly
sallied
out
from
my
room
took
a
sledge
and
drove
down
to
ivan
semyonitch
varia
was
sitting
alone
in
the
reading
karamzin
on
seeing
me
she
softly
laid
the
book
down
on
her
knees
and
with
agitated
curiosity
looked
into
my
face
i
had
never
been
to
see
them
in
the
morning
before
i
sat
down
beside
her
my
heart
beat
painfully
are
you
reading
i
asked
her
at
last
are
you
taking
up
russian
literature
she
suddenly
cut
me
short
me
have
you
come
from
andrei
that
name
that
trembling
questioning
voice
the
expression
of
her
face
all
these
unmistakable
signs
of
persistent
love
pierced
to
my
heart
like
arrows
i
resolved
either
to
part
from
varia
or
to
receive
from
her
herself
the
right
to
chase
the
hated
name
of
andrei
from
her
lips
for
ever
i
do
not
remember
what
i
said
to
her
at
first
i
must
have
expressed
myself
in
rather
confused
fashion
as
for
a
long
while
she
did
not
understand
me
at
last
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
almost
shouted
love
you
i
want
to
marry
you
love
me
said
varia
in
bewilderment
i
fancied
she
meant
to
get
up
to
go
away
to
refuse
me
god
sake
i
whispered
breathlessly
answer
me
do
say
yes
or
no
think
it
over
i
will
come
again
for
a
final
answer
i
have
long
loved
you
i
do
ask
of
you
love
i
want
to
be
your
champion
your
friend
do
answer
me
now
do
answer
till
with
these
words
i
rushed
out
of
the
room
in
the
passage
ivan
semyonitch
met
me
and
not
only
showed
no
surprise
at
my
visit
but
positively
with
an
agreeable
smile
offered
me
an
apple
such
unexpected
amiability
so
struck
me
that
i
was
simply
dumb
with
amazement
the
apple
it
a
nice
apple
really
persisted
ivan
semyonitch
mechanically
i
took
the
apple
at
last
and
drove
all
the
way
home
with
it
in
my
hand
you
may
easily
imagine
how
i
passed
all
that
day
and
the
following
morning
that
night
i
slept
rather
badly
god
my
god
i
kept
thinking
she
refuses
me
i
shall
die
i
shall
die
i
repeated
wearily
she
will
certainly
refuse
me
and
why
was
i
in
such
a
hurry
wishing
to
turn
my
thoughts
i
began
to
write
a
letter
to
my
father
a
desperate
resolute
letter
speaking
of
myself
i
used
the
expression
son
bobov
came
in
to
see
me
i
began
weeping
on
his
shoulder
which
must
have
surprised
poor
bobov
not
a
little
i
afterwards
learned
that
he
had
come
to
me
to
borrow
money
his
landlord
had
threatened
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
he
had
no
choice
but
to
hook
it
as
the
students
say
at
last
the
great
moment
arrived
on
going
out
of
my
room
i
stood
still
in
the
doorway
what
feelings
thought
i
i
cross
this
threshold
again
my
emotion
at
the
sight
of
ivan
semyonitch
little
house
was
so
great
that
i
got
down
picked
up
a
handful
of
snow
and
pressed
it
to
my
face
heavens
i
thought
i
find
varia
alone
i
am
lost
my
legs
were
giving
way
under
me
i
could
hardly
get
to
the
steps
things
were
as
i
had
hoped
i
found
varia
in
the
parlour
with
matrona
semyonovna
i
made
my
bows
awkwardly
and
sat
down
by
the
old
lady
varia
face
was
rather
paler
than
usual
i
fancied
that
she
tried
to
avoid
my
eyes
but
what
were
my
feelings
when
matrona
semyonovna
suddenly
got
up
and
went
into
the
next
room
i
began
looking
out
of
the
window
i
was
trembling
inwardly
like
an
autumn
leaf
varia
did
not
speak
at
last
i
mastered
my
timidity
went
up
to
her
bent
my
head
are
you
going
to
say
to
me
i
articulated
in
a
breaking
voice
varia
turned
away
the
tears
were
glistening
on
her
eyelashes
see
i
went
on
useless
for
me
to
varia
looked
shyly
round
and
gave
me
her
hand
without
a
word
i
cried
involuntarily
and
stopped
as
though
frightened
at
my
own
hopes
to
papa
she
articulated
at
last
permit
me
to
speak
to
ivan
semyonitch
i
covered
her
hands
with
kisses
do
whispered
varia
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
i
sat
down
beside
her
talked
soothingly
to
her
wiped
away
her
tears
luckily
ivan
semyonitch
was
not
at
home
and
matrona
semyonovna
had
gone
up
to
her
own
little
room
i
made
vows
of
love
of
constancy
to
varia
she
said
suppressing
her
sobs
and
continually
wiping
her
eyes
know
you
are
a
good
man
an
honest
man
you
are
not
like
name
again
thought
i
but
with
what
delight
i
kissed
those
warm
damp
little
hands
with
what
subdued
rapture
i
gazed
into
that
sweet
face
i
talked
to
her
of
the
future
walked
about
the
room
sat
down
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
hid
my
eyes
in
my
hands
and
shuddered
with
happiness
ivan
semyonitch
heavy
footsteps
cut
short
our
conversation
varia
hurriedly
got
up
and
went
off
to
her
own
room
without
however
pressing
my
hand
or
glancing
at
me
sidorenko
was
even
more
amiable
than
on
the
previous
day
he
laughed
rubbed
his
stomach
made
jokes
about
matrona
semyonovna
and
so
on
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
for
his
blessing
there
and
then
but
i
thought
better
of
it
and
deferred
doing
so
till
the
next
day
his
ponderous
jokes
jarred
upon
me
besides
i
was
exhausted
i
said
to
him
and
went
away
i
am
one
of
those
persons
who
love
brooding
over
their
own
sensations
though
i
can
not
endure
such
persons
myself
and
so
after
the
first
transport
of
heartfelt
joy
i
promptly
began
to
give
myself
up
to
all
sorts
of
reflections
when
i
had
got
half
a
mile
from
the
house
of
the
retired
lieutenant
i
flung
my
hat
up
in
the
air
in
excessive
delight
and
shouted
but
while
i
was
being
jolted
through
the
long
crooked
streets
of
moscow
my
thoughts
gradually
took
another
turn
all
sorts
of
rather
sordid
doubts
began
to
crowd
upon
my
mind
i
recalled
my
conversation
with
ivan
semyonitch
about
marriage
in
general
and
unconsciously
i
murmured
to
myself
he
was
putting
it
on
the
old
humbug
it
is
true
that
i
continually
repeated
then
varia
is
mine
mine
yet
that
alas
that
and
then
too
the
words
is
mine
aroused
in
me
not
a
deep
overwhelming
rapture
but
a
sort
of
paltry
egoistic
triumph
if
varia
had
refused
me
i
should
have
been
burning
with
furious
passion
but
having
received
her
consent
i
was
like
a
man
who
has
just
said
to
a
guest
yourself
at
home
and
sees
the
guest
actually
beginning
to
settle
into
his
room
as
if
he
were
at
home
she
had
loved
kolosov
i
thought
was
it
she
consented
so
soon
it
clear
she
glad
to
marry
any
one
well
what
of
it
all
the
better
for
it
was
with
such
vague
and
curious
feelings
that
i
crossed
the
threshold
of
my
room
possibly
gentlemen
my
story
does
not
strike
you
as
sounding
true
i
do
know
whether
it
sounds
true
or
not
but
i
know
that
all
i
have
told
is
the
absolute
and
literal
truth
however
i
gave
myself
up
all
that
day
to
a
feverish
gaiety
assured
myself
that
i
simply
did
not
deserve
such
happiness
but
next
morning
a
wonderful
thing
is
sleep
it
not
only
renews
one
body
in
a
way
it
renews
one
soul
restoring
it
to
primaeval
simplicity
and
naturalness
in
the
course
of
the
day
you
succeed
in
yourself
in
soaking
yourself
in
falsity
in
false
ideas
sleep
with
its
cool
wave
washes
away
all
such
pitiful
trashiness
and
on
waking
up
at
least
for
the
first
few
instants
you
are
capable
of
understanding
and
loving
truth
i
waked
up
and
reflecting
on
the
previous
day
i
felt
a
certain
discomfort
i
was
as
it
were
ashamed
of
all
my
own
actions
with
instinctive
uneasiness
i
thought
of
the
visit
to
be
made
that
day
of
my
interview
with
ivan
semyonitch
this
uneasiness
was
acute
and
distressing
it
was
like
the
uneasiness
of
the
hare
who
hears
the
barking
of
the
dogs
and
is
bound
at
last
to
run
out
of
his
native
forest
into
the
open
country
and
there
the
sharp
teeth
of
the
harriers
are
awaiting
him
was
i
in
such
a
hurry
i
repeated
just
as
i
had
the
day
before
but
in
quite
a
different
sense
i
remember
the
fearful
difference
between
yesterday
and
struck
myself
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
me
that
in
human
life
there
lie
hid
secrets
strange
secrets
with
childish
perplexity
i
gazed
into
this
new
not
fantastic
real
world
by
the
word
many
people
understand
perhaps
it
sometimes
is
so
but
i
must
own
that
the
first
appearance
of
before
me
shook
me
profoundly
scared
me
impressed
me
what
phrases
all
about
love
that
did
come
off
to
use
gogol
expression
i
come
back
to
my
story
in
the
course
of
that
day
i
assured
myself
again
that
i
was
the
most
blissful
of
mortals
i
drove
out
of
the
town
to
ivan
semyonitch
he
received
me
very
gleefully
he
had
been
meaning
to
go
and
see
a
neighbour
but
i
myself
stopped
him
i
was
afraid
to
be
left
alone
with
varia
the
evening
was
cheerful
but
not
reassuring
varia
was
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
neither
cordial
nor
melancholy
neither
pretty
nor
plain
i
looked
at
her
as
the
philosophers
say
objectively
that
is
to
say
as
the
man
who
has
dined
looks
at
the
dishes
i
thought
her
hands
were
rather
red
sometimes
however
my
heart
warmed
and
watching
her
i
gave
way
to
other
dreams
and
reveries
i
had
only
just
made
her
an
offer
as
it
is
called
and
here
i
was
already
feeling
as
though
we
were
living
as
husband
and
wife
as
though
our
souls
already
made
up
one
lovely
whole
belonged
to
one
another
and
consequently
were
trying
each
to
seek
out
a
separate
path
for
itself
have
you
spoken
to
papa
varia
said
to
me
as
soon
as
we
were
left
alone
this
inquiry
impressed
me
most
disagreeably
i
thought
to
myself
pleased
to
be
in
a
desperate
hurry
varvara
ivanovna
yet
i
answered
rather
shortly
i
will
speak
to
him
altogether
i
behaved
rather
casually
with
her
in
spite
of
my
promise
i
said
nothing
definite
to
ivan
semyonitch
as
i
was
leaving
i
pressed
his
hand
significantly
and
informed
him
that
i
wanted
to
have
a
little
talk
with
him
that
was
all
i
said
to
varia
we
meet
said
she
i
will
not
keep
you
long
in
suspense
gentlemen
i
am
afraid
of
exhausting
your
patience
we
never
met
again
i
never
went
back
to
ivan
semyonitch
the
first
days
it
is
true
of
my
voluntary
separation
from
varia
did
not
pass
without
tears
and
emotion
i
was
frightened
myself
at
the
rapid
drooping
of
my
love
twenty
times
over
i
was
on
the
point
of
starting
off
to
see
her
vividly
i
pictured
to
myself
her
amazement
her
grief
her
wounded
feelings
but
i
never
went
to
ivan
semyonitch
again
in
her
absence
i
begged
her
forgiveness
fell
on
my
knees
before
her
assured
her
of
my
profound
repentance
and
once
when
i
met
a
girl
in
the
street
slightly
resembling
her
i
took
to
my
heels
without
looking
back
and
only
breathed
freely
in
a
after
the
fifth
the
word
was
invented
for
irresolute
people
and
for
children
like
a
baby
i
lulled
myself
with
that
magic
word
i
will
go
to
her
whatever
happens
i
said
to
myself
and
ate
and
slept
well
i
began
to
think
a
great
deal
more
about
kolosov
than
about
varia
everywhere
continually
i
saw
his
open
bold
careless
face
i
began
going
to
see
him
as
before
he
gave
me
the
same
welcome
as
ever
but
how
deeply
i
felt
his
superiority
to
me
how
ridiculous
i
thought
all
my
fancies
my
pensive
melancholy
during
the
period
of
kolosov
connection
with
varia
my
magnanimous
resolution
to
bring
them
together
again
my
anticipations
my
raptures
my
remorse
i
had
played
a
wretched
part
of
screaming
farce
but
he
had
passed
so
simply
so
well
through
it
all
you
will
say
is
there
wonderful
in
that
your
kolosov
fell
in
love
with
a
girl
then
fell
out
of
love
again
and
threw
her
over
why
that
happens
with
everybody
agreed
but
which
of
us
knows
just
when
to
break
with
our
past
which
of
us
tell
me
is
not
afraid
of
the
reproaches
i
do
mean
of
the
woman
the
reproaches
of
every
chance
fool
which
of
us
is
proof
against
the
temptation
of
making
a
display
of
magnanimity
or
of
playing
egoistically
with
another
devoted
heart
which
of
us
in
fact
has
the
force
of
character
to
be
superior
to
petty
vanity
to
fine
sympathy
and
oh
gentlemen
the
man
who
leaves
a
woman
at
that
great
and
bitter
moment
when
he
is
forced
to
recognise
that
his
heart
is
not
altogether
not
fully
hers
that
man
believe
me
has
a
truer
and
deeper
comprehension
of
the
sacredness
of
love
than
the
creatures
who
from
dulness
or
weakness
go
on
playing
on
the
strings
of
their
flabby
and
sentimental
hearts
at
the
beginning
of
my
story
i
told
you
that
we
all
considered
andrei
kolosov
an
extraordinary
man
and
if
a
clear
simple
outlook
upon
life
if
the
absence
of
every
kind
of
cant
in
a
young
man
can
be
called
an
extraordinary
thing
kolosov
deserved
the
name
at
a
certain
age
to
be
natural
is
to
be
extraordinary
it
is
time
to
finish
though
i
thank
you
for
your
attention
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
three
months
after
my
last
visit
i
met
the
old
humbug
ivan
semyonitch
i
tried
of
course
to
glide
hurriedly
and
unnoticed
by
him
but
yet
i
could
not
help
overhearing
the
words
scoundrels
uttered
angrily
what
became
of
varia
asked
some
one
do
know
answered
the
we
all
got
up
and
separated
a
correspondence
a
few
years
ago
i
was
in
dresden
i
was
staying
at
an
hotel
from
early
morning
till
late
evening
i
strolled
about
the
town
and
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
make
acquaintance
with
my
neighbours
at
last
it
reached
my
ears
in
some
chance
way
that
there
was
a
russian
in
the
hotel
lying
ill
i
went
to
see
him
and
found
a
man
in
galloping
consumption
i
had
begun
to
be
tired
of
dresden
i
stayed
with
my
new
acquaintance
it
dull
work
sitting
with
a
sick
man
but
even
dulness
is
sometimes
agreeable
moreover
my
patient
was
not
and
was
very
ready
to
talk
we
tried
to
kill
time
in
all
sorts
of
ways
we
played
the
two
of
us
together
and
made
fun
of
the
doctor
my
compatriot
used
to
tell
this
very
german
all
sorts
of
fictions
about
himself
which
the
doctor
had
always
ago
anticipated
he
used
to
mimic
his
astonishment
at
any
new
exceptional
symptom
to
throw
his
medicines
out
of
window
and
so
on
i
observed
more
than
once
however
to
my
friend
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
send
for
a
good
doctor
before
it
was
too
late
that
his
complaint
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
so
on
but
alexey
my
new
friend
name
was
alexey
petrovitch
s
always
turned
off
my
advice
with
jests
at
the
expense
of
doctors
in
general
and
his
own
in
particular
and
at
last
one
rainy
autumn
evening
he
answered
my
urgent
entreaties
with
such
a
mournful
look
he
shook
his
head
so
sorrowfully
and
smiled
so
strangely
that
i
felt
somewhat
disconcerted
the
same
night
alexey
was
worse
and
the
next
day
he
died
just
before
his
death
his
usual
cheerfulness
deserted
him
he
tossed
about
uneasily
in
his
bed
sighed
looked
round
him
in
anguish
clutched
at
my
hand
and
whispered
with
an
effort
it
hard
to
die
you
know
dropped
his
head
on
the
pillow
and
shed
tears
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
and
sat
in
silence
by
his
bed
but
alexey
soon
got
the
better
of
these
last
late
regrets
say
he
said
to
me
doctor
come
and
find
me
dead
i
can
fancy
his
and
the
dying
man
tried
to
mimic
him
he
asked
me
to
send
all
his
things
to
russia
to
his
relations
with
the
exception
of
a
small
packet
which
he
gave
me
as
a
souvenir
this
packet
contained
letters
a
girl
letters
to
alexey
and
copies
of
his
letters
to
her
there
were
fifteen
of
them
alexey
petrovitch
s
had
known
marya
alexandrovna
b
long
before
in
their
childhood
i
fancy
alexey
petrovitch
had
a
cousin
marya
alexandrovna
had
a
sister
in
former
years
they
had
all
lived
together
then
they
had
been
separated
and
had
not
seen
each
other
for
a
long
while
later
on
they
had
chanced
one
summer
to
be
all
together
again
in
the
country
and
they
had
fallen
in
love
alexey
cousin
with
marya
alexandrovna
and
alexey
with
her
sister
the
summer
had
passed
by
the
autumn
came
they
parted
alexey
like
a
sensible
person
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
not
in
love
at
all
and
had
effected
a
very
satisfactory
parting
from
his
charmer
his
cousin
had
continued
writing
to
marya
alexandrovna
for
nearly
two
years
longer
but
he
too
perceived
at
last
that
he
was
deceiving
her
and
himself
in
an
unconscionable
way
and
he
too
dropped
the
correspondence
i
could
tell
you
something
about
marya
alexandrovna
gentle
reader
but
you
will
find
out
what
she
was
from
her
letters
alexey
wrote
his
first
letter
to
her
soon
after
she
had
finally
broken
with
his
cousin
he
was
at
that
time
in
petersburg
he
went
suddenly
abroad
fell
ill
and
died
at
dresden
i
resolved
to
print
his
correspondence
with
marya
alexandrovna
and
trust
the
reader
will
look
at
it
with
indulgence
as
these
letters
are
not
heaven
forbid
are
as
a
rule
only
read
by
two
persons
they
read
them
over
a
thousand
times
to
make
up
and
to
a
third
person
they
are
unendurable
if
not
ridiculous
i
from
alexey
petrovitch
to
marya
alexandrovna
petersburg
dear
marya
alexandrovna
i
fancy
i
have
never
written
to
you
before
and
here
i
am
writing
to
you
now
i
have
chosen
a
curious
time
to
begin
have
i
i
tell
you
what
gave
me
the
impulse
mon
cousin
théodore
was
with
me
and
how
shall
i
put
it
and
he
confided
to
me
as
the
greatest
secret
he
never
tells
one
anything
except
as
a
great
secret
that
he
was
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
here
and
that
this
time
he
is
firmly
resolved
to
be
married
and
that
he
has
already
taken
the
first
step
he
has
declared
himself
i
made
haste
of
course
to
congratulate
him
on
an
event
so
agreeable
for
him
he
has
been
longing
to
declare
himself
for
a
great
while
but
inwardly
i
must
own
i
was
rather
astonished
although
i
knew
that
everything
was
over
between
you
still
i
had
fancied
in
short
i
was
surprised
i
had
made
arrangements
to
go
out
to
see
friends
but
i
have
stopped
at
home
and
mean
to
have
a
little
gossip
with
you
if
you
do
not
care
to
listen
to
me
fling
this
letter
forthwith
into
the
fire
i
warn
you
i
mean
to
be
frank
though
i
feel
you
are
fully
justified
in
taking
me
for
a
rather
impertinent
person
observe
however
that
i
would
not
have
taken
up
my
pen
if
i
had
not
known
your
sister
was
not
with
you
she
is
staying
so
théodore
told
me
the
whole
summer
with
your
aunt
madame
b
god
give
her
every
blessing
and
so
this
is
how
it
has
all
worked
out
but
i
am
not
going
to
offer
you
my
friendship
and
all
that
i
am
shy
as
a
rule
of
speeches
and
effusions
in
beginning
to
write
this
letter
i
simply
obeyed
a
momentary
impulse
if
there
is
another
feeling
latent
within
me
let
it
remain
hidden
under
a
bushel
for
the
time
i
not
going
to
offer
you
sympathy
either
in
sympathising
with
others
people
for
the
most
part
want
to
get
rid
as
quick
as
they
can
of
an
unpleasant
feeling
of
involuntary
egoistic
regret
i
understand
genuine
warm
sympathy
but
such
sympathy
you
would
not
accept
from
just
any
one
do
please
get
angry
with
me
if
you
angry
you
be
sure
to
read
my
missive
to
the
end
but
what
right
have
i
to
write
to
you
to
talk
of
my
friendship
of
my
feelings
of
consolation
none
absolutely
none
that
i
am
bound
to
admit
and
i
can
only
throw
myself
on
your
kindness
do
you
know
what
the
preface
of
my
letter
like
i
tell
you
some
or
walking
into
the
of
a
lady
who
does
in
the
least
expect
him
and
who
does
perhaps
expect
some
one
else
he
realises
that
he
has
come
at
an
unlucky
moment
but
there
no
help
for
it
he
sits
down
begins
talking
goodness
knows
what
about
poetry
the
beauties
of
nature
the
advantages
of
a
good
education
talks
the
most
awful
rot
in
fact
but
meanwhile
the
first
five
minutes
have
gone
by
he
has
settled
himself
comfortably
the
lady
has
resigned
herself
to
the
inevitable
and
so
or
regains
his
takes
breath
and
begins
a
real
conversation
to
the
best
of
his
ability
in
spite
though
of
all
this
rigmarole
i
do
still
feel
quite
comfortable
i
seem
to
see
your
bewildered
even
rather
wrathful
face
i
feel
that
it
will
be
almost
impossible
you
should
not
ascribe
to
me
some
hidden
motives
and
so
like
a
roman
who
has
committed
some
folly
i
wrap
myself
majestically
in
my
toga
and
await
in
silence
your
final
sentence
the
question
is
will
you
allow
me
to
go
on
writing
to
you
i
remain
sincerely
and
warmly
devoted
to
you
alexey
ii
from
marya
alexandrovna
to
alexey
petrovitch
village
of
x
dear
sir
alexey
petrovitch
i
have
received
your
letter
and
i
really
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
i
should
not
even
have
answered
you
at
all
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
fancied
that
under
your
jesting
remarks
there
really
lies
hid
a
feeling
of
some
friendliness
your
letter
made
an
unpleasant
impression
on
me
in
answer
to
your
rigmarole
as
you
call
it
let
me
too
put
to
you
one
question
for
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
or
you
with
me
i
do
not
ascribe
to
you
any
bad
motives
on
the
contrary
grateful
for
your
sympathy
but
we
are
strangers
to
each
other
and
i
just
now
at
least
feel
not
the
slightest
inclination
for
greater
intimacy
with
any
one
with
sincere
esteem
i
remain
marya
iii
from
alexey
petrovitch
to
marya
alexandrovna
petersburg
thank
you
marya
alexandrovna
thank
you
for
your
note
brief
as
it
was
all
this
time
i
have
been
in
great
suspense
twenty
times
a
day
i
have
thought
of
you
and
my
letter
you
ca
imagine
how
bitterly
i
laughed
at
myself
but
now
i
am
in
an
excellent
frame
of
mind
and
very
much
pleased
with
myself
marya
alexandrovna
i
am
going
to
begin
a
correspondence
with
you
confess
this
was
not
at
all
what
you
expected
after
your
answer
i
surprised
myself
at
my
boldness
well
i
do
care
here
goes
but
do
be
uneasy
i
want
to
talk
to
you
not
of
you
but
of
myself
it
like
this
do
you
see
it
absolutely
needful
for
me
in
the
phraseology
to
open
my
heart
to
some
one
i
have
not
the
slightest
right
to
select
you
for
my
confidant
agreed
but
listen
i
wo
demand
of
you
an
answer
to
my
letters
i
do
even
want
to
know
whether
you
read
my
but
in
the
name
of
all
that
holy
do
send
my
letters
back
to
me
let
me
tell
you
i
am
utterly
alone
on
earth
in
my
youth
i
led
a
solitary
life
though
i
never
i
remember
posed
as
a
byronic
hero
but
first
circumstances
and
secondly
a
faculty
of
imaginative
dreaming
and
a
love
for
dreaming
rather
cool
blood
pride
indolence
a
number
of
different
causes
in
fact
cut
me
off
from
the
society
of
men
the
transition
from
to
real
life
took
place
in
me
late
perhaps
too
late
perhaps
it
has
not
fully
taken
place
up
to
now
so
long
as
i
found
entertainment
in
my
own
thoughts
and
feelings
so
long
as
i
was
capable
of
abandoning
myself
to
causeless
and
unuttered
transports
and
so
on
i
did
not
complain
of
my
solitude
i
had
no
associates
i
had
what
are
called
friends
sometimes
i
needed
their
presence
as
an
electrical
machine
needs
a
discharger
and
that
was
all
love
of
that
subject
we
will
not
speak
for
the
present
but
now
i
will
own
now
solitude
weighs
heavy
on
me
and
at
the
same
time
i
see
no
escape
from
my
position
i
do
not
blame
fate
i
alone
am
to
blame
and
am
deservedly
punished
in
my
youth
i
was
absorbed
by
one
thing
my
precious
self
i
took
my
for
modesty
i
avoided
society
and
here
i
am
now
a
fearful
bore
to
myself
what
am
i
to
do
with
myself
there
is
no
one
i
love
all
my
relations
with
other
people
are
somehow
strained
and
false
and
i
no
memories
either
for
in
all
my
past
life
i
can
find
nothing
but
my
own
personality
save
me
to
you
i
have
made
no
passionate
protestations
of
love
you
i
have
never
smothered
in
a
flood
of
aimless
babble
i
passed
by
you
rather
coldly
and
it
is
just
for
that
reason
i
make
up
my
mind
to
have
recourse
to
you
now
i
have
had
thoughts
of
doing
so
before
this
but
at
that
time
you
were
not
free
among
all
my
sensations
pleasures
and
sufferings
the
one
genuine
feeling
was
the
not
great
but
instinctive
attraction
to
you
which
withered
up
at
the
time
like
a
single
ear
of
wheat
in
the
midst
of
worthless
weeds
let
me
just
for
once
look
into
another
face
into
another
soul
my
own
face
has
grown
hateful
to
me
i
am
like
a
man
who
should
have
been
condemned
to
live
all
his
life
in
a
room
with
walls
of
i
do
not
ask
of
you
any
sort
of
confessions
oh
mercy
no
bestow
on
me
a
sister
unspoken
sympathy
or
at
least
the
simple
curiosity
of
a
reader
i
will
entertain
you
i
will
really
meanwhile
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
sincere
friend
iv
from
alexey
petrovitch
to
marya
alexandrovna
petersburg
i
am
writing
to
you
again
though
i
foresee
that
without
your
approval
i
shall
soon
cease
writing
i
must
own
that
you
can
not
but
feel
some
distrust
of
me
well
perhaps
you
are
right
too
in
old
days
i
should
have
triumphantly
announced
to
you
and
very
likely
i
should
have
quite
believed
my
own
words
myself
that
i
had
made
progress
since
the
time
when
we
parted
with
condescending
almost
affectionate
contempt
i
should
have
referred
to
my
past
and
with
touching
have
initiated
you
into
the
secrets
of
my
real
present
life
but
now
i
assure
you
marya
alexandrovna
i
positively
ashamed
and
sick
to
remember
the
capers
and
antics
cut
at
times
by
my
paltry
egoism
do
be
afraid
i
am
not
going
to
force
upon
you
any
great
truths
any
profound
views
i
have
none
of
them
of
those
truths
and
views
i
have
become
a
simple
good
fellow
really
i
am
bored
marya
alexandrovna
i
simply
bored
past
all
enduring
that
is
why
i
am
writing
to
you
i
really
believe
we
may
come
to
be
friends
but
i
positively
incapable
of
talking
to
you
till
you
hold
out
a
hand
to
me
till
i
get
a
note
from
you
with
the
one
word
marya
alexandrovna
are
you
willing
to
listen
to
me
that
the
yours
devotedly
v
from
marya
alexandrovna
to
alexey
petrovitch
village
of
x
what
a
strange
person
you
are
very
well
yes
marya
vi
from
alexey
petrovitch
to
marya
alexandrovna
petersburg
hurrah
thanks
marya
alexandrovna
thanks
you
are
a
very
kind
and
indulgent
creature
i
will
begin
according
to
my
promise
to
talk
about
myself
and
i
shall
talk
with
a
relish
approaching
to
appetite
that
just
it
of
anything
in
the
world
one
may
speak
with
fire
with
enthusiasm
with
ecstasy
but
with
appetite
one
talks
only
of
oneself
let
me
tell
you
during
the
last
few
days
a
very
strange
experience
has
befallen
me
i
have
for
the
first
time
taken
an
view
of
my
past
you
understand
me
every
one
of
us
often
recalls
what
is
over
with
regret
or
vexation
or
simply
from
nothing
to
do
but
to
bend
a
cold
clear
gaze
over
all
one
past
life
as
a
traveller
turns
and
looks
from
a
high
mountain
on
the
plain
he
has
passed
through
is
only
possible
at
a
certain
age
and
a
secret
chill
clutches
at
a
man
heart
when
it
happens
to
him
for
the
first
time
mine
anyway
felt
a
sick
pang
while
we
are
young
an
view
is
impossible
but
my
youth
is
over
and
like
one
who
has
climbed
on
to
a
mountain
everything
lies
clear
before
me
yes
my
youth
is
gone
gone
never
to
return
here
it
lies
before
me
as
it
were
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
a
sorry
spectacle
i
will
confess
to
you
marya
alexandrovna
i
am
very
sorry
for
myself
my
god
my
god
can
it
be
that
i
have
myself
so
utterly
ruined
my
life
so
mercilessly
embroiled
and
tortured
myself
now
i
have
come
to
my
senses
but
it
too
late
has
it
ever
happened
to
you
to
save
a
fly
from
a
spider
has
it
you
remember
you
put
it
in
the
sun
its
wings
and
legs
were
stuck
together
glued
how
awkwardly
it
moved
how
clumsily
it
attempted
to
get
clear
after
prolonged
efforts
it
somehow
gets
better
crawls
tries
to
open
its
wings
but
there
is
no
more
frolicking
for
it
no
more
buzzing
in
the
sunshine
as
before
when
it
was
flying
through
the
open
window
into
the
cool
room
and
out
again
freely
winging
its
way
into
the
hot
air
the
fly
at
least
fell
through
none
of
its
own
doing
into
the
dreadful
web
but
i
i
have
been
my
own
spider
and
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
greatly
blame
myself
who
indeed
tell
me
pray
is
ever
to
blame
for
anything
alone
or
to
put
it
better
we
are
all
to
blame
and
yet
we
ca
be
blamed
circumstances
determine
us
they
shove
us
into
one
road
or
another
and
then
they
punish
us
for
it
every
man
has
his
destiny
wait
a
bit
wait
a
bit
a
cleverly
but
true
comparison
has
just
come
into
my
head
as
the
clouds
are
first
condensed
from
the
vapours
of
earth
rise
from
out
of
her
bosom
then
separate
move
away
from
her
and
at
last
bring
her
prosperity
or
ruin
so
about
every
one
of
us
and
out
of
ourselves
is
fashioned
how
is
one
to
express
it
is
fashioned
a
sort
of
element
which
has
afterwards
a
destructive
or
saving
influence
on
us
this
element
i
call
destiny
in
other
words
and
speaking
simply
every
one
makes
his
own
destiny
and
destiny
makes
every
one
every
one
makes
his
destiny
yes
but
people
like
us
make
it
too
much
that
what
wrong
with
us
consciousness
is
awakened
too
early
in
us
too
early
we
begin
to
keep
watch
on
ourselves
we
russians
have
set
ourselves
no
other
task
in
life
but
the
cultivation
of
our
own
personality
and
when
we
children
hardly
we
set
to
work
to
cultivate
it
this
luckless
personality
receiving
no
definite
guidance
from
without
with
no
real
respect
for
anything
no
strong
belief
in
anything
we
are
free
to
make
what
we
choose
of
ourselves
one
expect
every
one
to
understand
on
the
spot
the
uselessness
of
intellect
in
vain
activity
and
so
we
get
again
one
monster
the
more
in
the
world
one
more
of
those
worthless
creatures
in
whom
habits
of
distort
the
very
striving
for
truth
and
a
ludicrous
simplicity
exists
side
by
side
with
a
pitiful
duplicity
one
of
those
beings
of
impotent
restless
thought
who
all
their
lives
know
neither
the
satisfaction
of
natural
activity
nor
genuine
suffering
nor
the
genuine
thrill
of
conviction
mixing
up
together
in
ourselves
the
defects
of
all
ages
we
rob
each
defect
of
its
good
redeeming
side
we
are
as
silly
as
children
but
we
are
not
sincere
as
they
are
we
are
cold
as
old
people
but
we
have
none
of
the
good
sense
of
old
age
to
make
up
we
are
psychologists
oh
yes
we
are
great
psychologists
but
our
psychology
is
akin
to
pathology
our
psychology
is
that
subtle
study
of
the
laws
of
morbid
condition
and
morbid
development
with
which
healthy
people
have
nothing
to
do
and
what
is
the
chief
point
we
are
not
young
even
in
our
youth
we
are
not
young
and
at
the
same
time
why
libel
ourselves
were
we
never
young
did
we
never
know
the
play
the
fire
the
thrill
of
life
forces
we
too
have
been
in
arcady
we
too
have
strayed
about
her
bright
meadows
have
you
chanced
strolling
about
a
copse
to
come
across
those
dark
grasshoppers
which
jumping
up
from
under
your
very
feet
suddenly
with
a
whirring
sound
expand
bright
red
wings
fly
a
few
yards
and
then
drop
again
into
the
grass
so
our
dark
youth
at
times
spread
its
particoloured
wings
for
a
few
moments
and
for
no
long
flight
do
you
remember
our
silent
evening
walks
the
four
of
us
together
beside
your
garden
fence
after
some
long
warm
spirited
conversation
do
you
remember
those
blissful
moments
nature
benign
and
stately
took
us
to
her
bosom
we
plunged
swooning
into
a
flood
of
bliss
all
around
the
sunset
with
a
sudden
and
soft
flush
the
glowing
sky
the
earth
bathed
in
light
everything
on
all
sides
seemed
full
of
the
fresh
and
fiery
breath
of
youth
the
joyous
triumph
of
some
deathless
happiness
the
sunset
flamed
and
like
it
our
rapturous
hearts
burned
with
soft
and
passionate
fire
and
the
tiny
leaves
of
the
young
trees
quivered
faintly
and
expectantly
over
our
heads
as
though
in
response
to
the
inward
tremor
of
vague
feelings
and
anticipations
in
us
do
you
remember
the
purity
the
goodness
and
trustfulness
of
ideas
the
softening
of
noble
hopes
the
silence
of
full
hearts
were
we
not
really
then
worth
something
better
than
what
life
has
brought
us
to
why
was
it
ordained
for
us
only
at
rare
moments
to
see
the
shore
and
never
to
stand
firmly
on
it
never
to
touch
it
to
weep
with
joy
like
the
first
jew
upon
the
border
of
the
promised
land
these
two
lines
of
fet
remind
me
of
others
also
his
do
you
remember
once
as
we
stood
in
the
highroad
we
saw
in
the
distance
a
cloud
of
pink
dust
blown
up
by
the
light
breeze
against
the
setting
sun
an
eddying
cloud
you
began
and
we
were
all
still
at
once
to
listen
an
eddying
cloud
dust
rises
in
the
distance
rider
or
man
on
foot
is
seen
not
in
the
dust
i
see
some
one
trotting
on
a
gallant
steed
friend
of
mine
friend
far
away
think
oh
think
of
me
you
ceased
we
all
felt
a
shudder
pass
over
us
as
though
the
breath
of
love
had
flitted
over
our
hearts
and
each
of
us
i
am
sure
of
it
felt
irresistibly
drawn
into
the
distance
the
unknown
distance
where
the
phantom
of
bliss
rises
and
lures
through
the
mist
and
all
the
while
observe
the
strangeness
why
one
wonders
should
we
have
a
yearning
for
the
far
away
were
we
not
in
love
with
each
other
was
not
happiness
close
so
possible
as
i
asked
you
just
now
why
was
it
we
did
not
touch
the
shore
because
falsehood
walked
hand
in
hand
with
us
because
it
poisoned
our
best
feelings
because
everything
in
us
was
artificial
and
strained
because
we
did
not
love
each
other
at
all
but
were
only
trying
to
love
fancying
we
loved
but
enough
enough
why
inflame
one
wounds
besides
it
is
all
over
and
done
with
what
was
good
in
our
past
moved
me
and
on
that
good
i
will
take
leave
of
you
for
a
while
it
time
to
make
an
end
of
this
long
letter
i
am
going
out
for
a
breath
here
of
the
may
air
in
which
spring
is
breaking
through
the
dry
fastness
of
winter
with
a
sort
of
damp
keen
warmth
yours
vii
from
marya
alexandrovna
to
alexey
petrovitch
village
of
x
i
have
received
your
letter
alexey
petrovitch
and
do
you
know
what
feeling
t
aroused
in
me
indignation
yes
indignation
and
i
will
explain
to
you
at
once
why
it
aroused
just
that
feeling
in
me
it
only
a
pity
i
not
a
great
hand
with
my
pen
i
rarely
write
and
am
not
good
at
expressing
my
thoughts
precisely
and
in
few
words
but
you
will
i
hope
come
to
my
aid
you
must
try
on
your
side
to
understand
me
if
only
to
find
out
why
i
am
indignant
with
you
tell
me
you
have
brains
have
you
ever
asked
yourself
what
sort
of
creature
a
russian
woman
is
what
is
her
destiny
her
position
in
the
world
in
short
what
is
her
life
i
do
know
if
you
have
had
time
to
put
this
question
to
yourself
i
ca
picture
to
myself
how
you
would
answer
it
i
should
perhaps
in
conversation
be
capable
of
giving
you
my
ideas
on
the
subject
but
on
paper
i
am
scarcely
equal
to
it
no
matter
though
this
is
the
point
you
will
certainly
agree
with
me
that
we
women
those
of
us
at
least
who
are
not
satisfied
with
the
common
interests
of
domestic
life
receive
our
final
education
in
any
case
from
you
men
you
have
a
great
and
powerful
influence
on
us
now
consider
what
you
do
to
us
i
am
talking
about
young
girls
especially
those
who
like
me
live
in
the
wilds
and
there
are
very
many
such
in
russia
besides
i
do
know
anything
of
others
and
can
not
judge
of
them
picture
to
yourself
such
a
girl
her
education
suppose
is
finished
she
begins
to
live
to
enjoy
herself
but
enjoyment
alone
is
not
much
to
her
she
demands
much
from
life
she
reads
and
dreams
of
love
always
nothing
but
love
you
will
say
suppose
so
but
that
word
means
a
great
deal
to
her
i
repeat
that
i
am
not
speaking
of
a
girl
to
whom
thinking
is
tiresome
and
boring
she
looks
round
her
is
waiting
for
the
time
when
he
will
come
for
whom
her
soul
yearns
at
last
he
makes
his
appearance
she
is
captivated
she
is
wax
in
his
hands
all
happiness
and
love
and
thought
all
have
come
with
a
rush
together
with
him
all
her
tremors
are
soothed
all
her
doubts
solved
by
him
truth
itself
seems
speaking
by
his
lips
she
venerates
him
is
at
her
own
happiness
learns
loves
great
is
his
power
over
her
at
that
time
if
he
were
a
hero
he
would
fire
her
would
teach
her
to
sacrifice
herself
and
all
sacrifices
would
be
easy
to
her
but
there
are
no
heroes
in
our
times
anyway
he
directs
her
as
he
pleases
she
devotes
herself
to
whatever
interests
him
every
word
of
his
sinks
into
her
soul
she
has
not
yet
learned
how
worthless
and
empty
and
false
a
word
may
be
how
little
it
costs
him
who
utters
it
and
how
little
it
deserves
belief
after
these
first
moments
of
bliss
and
hope
there
usually
comes
through
circumstances
circumstances
are
always
to
blame
there
comes
a
parting
they
say
there
have
been
instances
of
two
kindred
souls
on
getting
to
know
one
another
becoming
at
once
inseparably
united
i
have
heard
it
said
too
that
things
did
not
always
go
smoothly
with
them
in
consequence
but
of
what
i
have
not
seen
myself
i
will
not
speak
and
that
the
pettiest
calculation
the
most
pitiful
prudence
can
exist
in
a
youthful
heart
side
by
side
with
the
most
passionate
enthusiasm
of
that
i
have
to
my
sorrow
had
practical
experience
and
so
the
parting
comes
happy
the
girl
who
realises
at
once
that
it
is
the
end
of
everything
who
does
not
beguile
herself
with
expectations
but
you
valorous
just
men
for
the
most
part
have
not
the
pluck
nor
even
the
desire
to
tell
us
the
truth
it
is
less
disturbing
for
you
to
deceive
us
however
i
am
ready
to
believe
that
you
deceive
yourselves
together
with
us
parting
to
bear
separation
is
both
hard
and
easy
if
only
there
be
perfect
untouched
faith
in
him
whom
one
loves
the
soul
can
master
the
anguish
of
parting
i
will
say
more
it
is
only
then
when
she
is
left
alone
that
she
finds
out
the
sweetness
of
solitude
not
fruitless
but
filled
with
memories
and
ideas
it
is
only
then
that
she
finds
out
herself
comes
to
her
true
self
grows
strong
in
the
letters
of
her
friend
far
away
she
finds
a
support
for
herself
in
her
own
she
very
likely
for
the
first
time
finds
full
but
as
two
people
who
start
from
a
source
along
opposite
banks
at
first
can
touch
hands
then
only
communicate
by
voice
and
finally
lose
sight
of
each
other
altogether
so
two
natures
grow
apart
at
last
by
separation
well
what
then
you
will
say
it
clear
they
were
not
destined
to
be
together
but
herein
the
difference
between
a
man
and
a
woman
comes
out
for
a
man
it
means
nothing
to
begin
a
new
life
to
shake
off
all
his
past
a
woman
can
not
do
this
no
she
can
not
fling
off
her
past
she
can
not
break
away
from
her
roots
no
a
thousand
times
no
and
now
begins
a
pitiful
and
ludicrous
spectacle
gradually
losing
hope
and
faith
in
herself
and
how
bitter
that
is
you
can
not
even
imagine
she
pines
and
wears
herself
out
alone
obstinately
clinging
to
her
memories
and
turning
away
from
everything
that
the
life
around
offers
her
but
he
look
for
him
where
is
he
and
is
it
worth
his
while
to
stand
still
when
has
he
time
to
look
round
why
it
all
a
thing
of
the
past
for
him
or
else
this
is
what
happens
it
happens
that
he
feels
a
sudden
inclination
to
meet
the
former
object
of
his
feelings
that
he
even
makes
an
excursion
with
that
aim
but
mercy
on
us
the
pitiful
conceit
that
leads
him
into
doing
that
in
his
gracious
sympathy
in
his
friendly
advice
in
his
indulgent
explanation
of
the
past
such
consciousness
of
his
superiority
is
manifest
it
is
so
agreeable
and
cheering
for
him
to
let
himself
feel
every
instant
what
a
clever
person
he
is
and
how
kind
and
how
little
he
understands
what
he
has
done
how
clever
he
is
at
not
even
guessing
what
is
passing
in
a
woman
heart
and
how
offensive
is
his
compassion
if
he
does
guess
it
tell
me
please
where
is
she
to
get
strength
to
bear
all
this
recollect
this
too
for
the
most
part
a
girl
in
whose
brain
to
her
misfortune
thought
has
begun
to
stir
such
a
girl
when
she
begins
to
love
and
falls
under
a
man
influence
inevitably
grows
apart
from
her
family
her
circle
of
friends
she
was
not
even
before
then
satisfied
with
their
life
though
she
moved
in
step
with
them
while
she
treasured
all
her
secret
dreams
in
her
soul
but
the
discrepancy
soon
becomes
apparent
they
cease
to
comprehend
her
and
are
ready
to
look
askance
at
everything
she
does
at
first
this
is
nothing
to
her
but
afterwards
afterwards
when
she
is
left
alone
when
what
she
was
striving
towards
for
which
she
had
sacrificed
everything
when
heaven
is
not
gained
while
everything
near
everything
possible
is
lost
what
is
there
to
support
her
jeers
sly
hints
the
vulgar
triumph
of
coarse
commonsense
she
could
still
endure
somehow
but
what
is
she
to
do
what
is
to
be
her
refuge
when
an
inner
voice
begins
to
whisper
to
her
that
all
of
them
are
right
and
she
was
wrong
that
life
whatever
it
may
be
is
better
than
dreams
as
health
is
better
than
sickness
when
her
favourite
pursuits
her
favourite
books
grow
hateful
to
her
books
out
of
which
there
is
no
reading
happiness
what
tell
me
is
to
be
her
support
must
she
not
inevitably
succumb
in
such
a
struggle
how
is
she
to
live
and
to
go
on
living
in
such
a
desert
to
know
oneself
beaten
and
to
hold
out
one
hand
like
a
beggar
to
persons
quite
indifferent
for
them
to
bestow
the
sympathy
which
the
proud
heart
had
once
fancied
it
could
well
dispense
with
all
that
would
be
nothing
but
to
feel
yourself
ludicrous
at
the
very
instant
when
you
are
shedding
bitter
bitter
tears
o
god
spare
such
suffering
my
hands
are
trembling
and
i
am
quite
in
a
fever
my
face
burns
it
is
time
to
stop
i
send
off
this
letter
quickly
before
ashamed
of
its
feebleness
but
for
god
sake
in
your
answer
not
a
word
do
you
hear
not
a
word
of
sympathy
or
i
never
write
to
you
again
understand
me
i
should
not
like
you
to
take
this
letter
as
the
outpouring
of
a
misunderstood
soul
complaining
ah
i
care
viii
from
alexey
petrovitch
to
marya
alexandrovna
petersburg
marya
alexandrovna
you
are
a
splendid
person
you
your
letter
revealed
the
truth
to
me
at
last
my
god
what
suffering
a
man
is
constantly
thinking
that
now
at
last
he
has
reached
simplicity
that
he
no
longer
showing
off
humbugging
lying
but
when
you
come
to
look
at
him
more
attentively
he
become
almost
worse
than
before
and
this
too
one
must
remark
the
man
himself
alone
that
is
never
attains
this
try
as
he
will
his
eyes
can
not
see
his
own
defects
just
as
the
compositor
wearied
eyes
can
not
see
the
slips
he
makes
another
fresh
eye
is
needed
for
that
my
thanks
to
you
marya
alexandrovna
you
see
i
speak
to
you
of
myself
of
you
i
dare
not
speak
ah
how
absurd
my
last
letter
seems
to
me
now
so
flowery
and
sentimental
i
beg
you
earnestly
go
on
with
your
confession
i
fancy
you
too
will
be
the
better
for
it
and
it
will
do
me
great
good
a
true
saying
woman
wit
better
than
many
a
reason
and
a
woman
heart
far
and
away
by
god
yes
if
women
knew
how
much
better
nobler
and
wiser
they
are
than
men
yes
wiser
they
would
grow
conceited
and
be
spoiled
but
happily
they
do
know
it
they
do
know
it
because
their
intelligence
is
in
the
habit
of
turning
incessantly
upon
themselves
as
with
us
they
think
very
little
about
themselves
that
their
weakness
and
their
strength
that
the
whole
secret
i
wo
say
of
our
superiority
but
of
our
power
they
lavish
their
soul
as
a
prodigal
heir
does
his
father
gold
while
we
exact
a
percentage
on
every
worthless
morsel
how
are
they
to
hold
their
own
with
us
all
this
is
not
compliments
but
the
simple
truth
proved
by
experience
once
more
i
beseech
you
marya
alexandrovna
go
on
writing
to
me
if
you
knew
all
that
is
coming
into
my
brain
but
i
have
no
wish
now
to
speak
i
want
to
listen
to
you
my
turn
will
come
later
write
your
devoted
ix
from
marya
alexandrovna
to
alexey
petrovitch
village
of
x
i
had
hardly
sent
off
my
last
letter
to
you
alexey
petrovitch
when
i
regretted
it
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
then
one
thing
reassures
me
somewhat
i
am
sure
you
realised
that
it
was
under
the
influence
of
feelings
long
ago
suppressed
that
it
was
written
and
you
excused
me
i
did
not
even
read
through
at
the
time
what
i
had
written
to
you
i
remember
my
heart
beat
so
violently
that
the
pen
shook
in
my
fingers
however
though
i
should
probably
have
expressed
myself
differently
if
i
had
allowed
myself
time
to
reflect
i
do
mean
all
the
same
to
disavow
my
own
words
or
the
feelings
which
i
described
to
you
as
best
i
could
i
am
much
cooler
and
far
more
i
remember
at
the
end
of
my
letter
i
spoke
of
the
painful
position
of
a
girl
who
is
conscious
of
being
solitary
even
among
her
own
people
i
wo
expatiate
further
upon
them
but
will
rather
tell
you
a
few
instances
i
think
i
shall
bore
you
less
in
that
way
in
the
first
place
then
let
me
tell
you
that
all
over
the
i
am
never
called
anything
but
the
female
philosopher
the
ladies
especially
honour
me
with
that
name
some
assert
that
i
sleep
with
a
latin
book
in
my
hand
and
in
spectacles
others
declare
that
i
know
how
to
extract
cube
roots
whatever
they
may
be
not
a
single
one
of
them
doubts
that
i
wear
manly
apparel
on
the
sly
and
instead
of
address
people
spasmodically
with
sand
and
indignation
grows
apace
against
the
female
philosopher
we
have
a
neighbour
a
man
of
a
great
wit
at
least
he
is
reputed
a
great
wit
for
him
my
poor
personality
is
an
inexhaustible
subject
of
jokes
he
used
to
tell
of
me
that
directly
the
moon
rose
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
it
and
he
will
mimic
the
way
in
which
i
gaze
at
it
and
declares
that
i
positively
take
my
coffee
with
moonshine
instead
of
with
milk
that
to
say
i
put
my
cup
in
the
moonlight
he
swears
that
i
use
phrases
of
this
kind
is
easy
because
it
is
difficult
though
on
the
other
hand
it
is
difficult
because
it
is
easy
he
asserts
that
i
am
always
looking
for
a
word
always
striving
and
with
comic
rage
inquires
whither
he
has
also
circulated
a
story
about
me
that
i
ride
at
night
up
and
down
by
the
river
singing
schubert
serenade
or
simply
moaning
beethoven
she
is
he
will
say
such
an
impassioned
old
person
and
so
on
and
so
on
of
course
all
this
comes
straight
to
me
this
surprises
you
perhaps
but
do
not
forget
that
four
years
have
passed
since
your
stay
in
these
parts
you
remember
how
every
one
frowned
upon
us
in
those
days
their
turn
has
come
now
and
all
that
too
is
no
consequence
i
have
to
hear
many
things
that
wound
my
heart
more
than
that
i
wo
say
anything
about
my
poor
good
mother
never
having
been
able
to
forgive
me
for
your
cousin
indifference
to
me
but
my
whole
life
is
burning
away
like
a
house
on
fire
as
my
nurse
expresses
it
course
i
am
constantly
hearing
ca
keep
pace
with
you
we
are
plain
people
we
are
guided
by
nothing
but
though
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
what
have
all
these
metaphysics
and
books
and
intimacies
with
learned
folks
brought
you
to
you
perhaps
remember
my
sister
not
the
one
to
whom
you
were
once
not
indifferent
but
the
other
elder
one
who
is
married
her
husband
if
you
recollect
is
a
simple
and
rather
comic
person
you
often
used
to
make
fun
of
him
in
those
days
but
she
happy
after
all
she
the
mother
of
a
family
she
fond
of
her
husband
her
husband
adores
her
am
like
every
one
else
she
says
to
me
sometimes
you
and
she
right
i
envy
her
and
yet
i
feel
i
should
not
care
to
change
with
her
all
the
same
let
them
call
me
a
female
philosopher
a
queer
fish
or
what
they
choose
i
will
remain
true
to
the
end
to
what
to
an
ideal
or
what
yes
to
my
ideal
yes
i
will
be
faithful
to
the
end
to
what
first
set
my
heart
throbbing
to
what
i
have
recognised
and
recognise
still
as
truth
and
good
if
only
my
strength
does
not
fail
me
if
only
my
divinity
does
not
turn
out
to
be
a
dumb
and
soulless
idol
if
you
really
feel
any
friendship
for
me
if
you
have
really
not
forgotten
me
you
ought
to
aid
me
you
ought
to
solve
my
doubts
and
strengthen
my
convictions
though
after
all
what
help
can
you
give
me
that
rubbish
was
said
to
me
yesterday
by
my
uncle
i
think
you
know
him
a
retired
naval
officer
a
very
sensible
man
children
a
pot
of
soup
to
look
after
the
husband
and
children
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
pot
that
what
a
woman
tell
me
is
he
right
if
he
really
is
right
i
can
still
make
up
for
the
past
i
can
still
get
into
the
common
groove
why
should
i
wait
any
longer
what
have
i
to
hope
for
in
one
of
your
letters
you
spoke
of
the
wings
of
youth
how
often
how
long
they
are
tied
and
later
on
comes
the
time
when
they
fall
off
and
there
is
no
rising
above
earth
no
flying
to
heaven
any
more
write
to
yours
x
from
alexey
petrovitch
to
marya
alexandrovna
petersburg
i
hasten
to
answer
your
letter
dear
marya
alexandrovna
i
will
confess
to
you
that
if
it
were
not
i
ca
say
for
business
for
i
have
none
if
it
were
not
that
i
am
stupidly
accustomed
to
this
place
i
should
have
gone
off
to
see
you
again
and
should
have
talked
to
my
heart
content
but
on
paper
it
all
comes
out
cold
and
dead
marya
alexandrovna
i
tell
you
again
women
are
better
than
men
and
you
ought
to
prove
this
in
practice
let
such
as
us
fling
away
our
convictions
like
clothes
or
abandon
them
for
a
crust
of
bread
or
lull
them
into
an
untroubled
sleep
and
put
over
them
as
over
the
dead
once
dear
to
us
a
gravestone
at
which
to
come
at
rare
intervals
to
pray
let
us
do
all
this
but
you
women
must
not
be
false
to
yourselves
you
must
not
be
false
to
your
ideal
that
word
has
become
ridiculous
to
fear
being
ridiculous
is
not
to
love
truth
it
happens
indeed
that
the
senseless
laughter
of
the
fool
drives
even
good
men
into
giving
up
a
great
deal
as
for
instance
the
defence
of
an
absent
friend
i
have
been
guilty
of
that
myself
but
i
repeat
you
women
are
better
than
we
in
trifling
matters
you
give
in
sooner
than
we
but
you
know
how
to
face
fearful
odds
better
than
we
i
do
want
to
give
you
either
advice
or
help
how
should
i
besides
you
have
no
need
of
it
but
i
hold
out
my
hand
to
you
i
say
to
you
have
patience
struggle
on
to
the
end
and
let
me
tell
you
that
as
a
sentiment
the
consciousness
of
an
honestly
sustained
struggle
is
almost
higher
than
the
triumph
of
victory
victory
does
not
depend
on
ourselves
of
course
your
uncle
is
right
from
a
certain
point
of
view
family
life
is
everything
for
a
woman
for
her
there
is
no
other
life
but
what
does
that
prove
none
but
jesuits
will
maintain
that
any
means
are
good
if
only
they
attain
the
end
it
false
it
false
feet
sullied
with
the
mud
of
the
road
are
unworthy
to
go
into
a
holy
temple
at
the
end
of
your
letter
is
a
phrase
i
do
not
like
you
want
to
get
into
the
common
groove
take
care
do
make
a
false
step
besides
do
not
forget
there
is
no
erasing
the
past
and
however
much
you
try
whatever
pressure
you
put
on
yourself
you
will
not
turn
into
your
sister
you
have
reached
a
higher
level
than
she
but
your
soul
has
been
scorched
in
the
fire
hers
is
untouched
descend
to
her
level
stoop
to
her
you
can
but
nature
will
not
give
up
her
rights
and
the
burnt
place
will
not
grow
again
you
are
afraid
let
us
speak
plainly
you
are
afraid
of
being
left
an
old
maid
you
are
i
know
already
certainly
the
position
of
old
maids
is
an
unenviable
one
every
one
is
so
ready
to
laugh
at
them
every
one
comments
with
such
ungenerous
amusement
on
their
peculiarities
and
weaknesses
but
if
you
scrutinise
with
a
little
attention
any
old
bachelor
one
may
just
as
well
point
the
finger
of
scorn
at
him
one
will
find
plenty
in
him
too
to
laugh
at
there
no
help
for
it
there
is
no
getting
happiness
by
struggling
for
it
but
we
must
not
forget
that
it
not
happiness
but
human
dignity
that
the
chief
aim
in
life
you
describe
your
position
with
great
humour
i
well
understand
all
the
bitterness
of
it
your
position
one
may
really
call
tragic
but
let
me
tell
you
you
are
not
alone
in
it
there
is
scarcely
any
quite
modern
person
who
is
placed
in
it
you
will
say
that
that
makes
it
no
better
for
you
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
suffering
in
company
with
thousands
is
quite
a
different
matter
from
suffering
alone
it
is
not
a
matter
of
egoism
but
a
sense
of
a
general
inevitability
which
comes
in
all
this
is
very
fine
granted
you
will
say
but
not
practicable
in
reality
why
not
practicable
i
have
hitherto
imagined
and
i
hope
i
shall
never
cease
to
imagine
that
in
god
world
everything
honest
good
and
true
is
practicable
and
will
sooner
or
later
come
to
pass
and
not
only
will
be
realised
but
is
already
being
realised
let
each
man
only
hold
firm
in
his
place
not
lose
patience
nor
desire
the
impossible
but
do
all
in
his
power
but
i
fancy
i
have
gone
off
too
much
into
abstractions
i
will
defer
the
continuation
of
my
reflections
till
the
next
letter
but
i
can
not
lay
down
my
pen
without
warmly
most
warmly
pressing
your
hand
and
wishing
you
from
my
soul
all
that
is
good
on
earth
yours
by
the
way
you
say
it
useless
for
you
to
wait
that
you
have
nothing
to
hope
for
how
do
you
know
that
let
me
ask
xi
from
marya
alexandrovna
to
alexey
petrovitch
village
of
x
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
for
your
letter
alexey
petrovitch
how
much
good
it
did
me
i
see
you
really
are
a
good
and
trustworthy
man
and
so
i
shall
not
be
reserved
with
you
i
trust
you
i
know
you
would
make
no
unkind
use
of
my
openness
and
will
give
me
friendly
counsel
here
is
the
question
you
noticed
at
the
end
of
my
letter
a
phrase
which
you
did
not
quite
like
i
will
tell
what
it
had
reference
to
there
is
one
of
the
neighbours
here
he
was
not
here
when
you
were
and
you
have
not
seen
him
he
i
could
marry
him
if
i
liked
he
is
still
young
and
has
property
there
are
no
difficulties
on
the
part
of
my
parents
on
the
contrary
they
i
know
for
a
fact
desire
this
marriage
he
is
a
good
man
and
i
think
he
loves
me
but
he
is
so
spiritless
and
narrow
his
aspirations
are
so
limited
that
i
can
not
but
be
conscious
of
my
superiority
to
him
he
is
aware
of
this
and
as
it
were
rejoices
in
it
and
that
is
just
what
sets
me
against
him
i
can
not
respect
him
though
he
has
an
excellent
heart
what
am
i
to
do
tell
me
think
for
me
and
write
me
your
opinion
sincerely
but
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
for
your
letter
do
you
know
i
have
been
haunted
at
times
by
such
bitter
thoughts
do
you
know
i
had
come
to
the
point
of
being
almost
ashamed
of
every
feeling
not
of
enthusiasm
only
but
even
of
faith
i
used
to
shut
a
book
with
vexation
whenever
there
was
anything
about
hope
or
happiness
in
it
and
turned
away
from
a
cloudless
sky
from
the
fresh
green
of
the
trees
from
everything
that
was
smiling
and
joyful
what
a
painful
condition
it
was
i
say
as
though
it
were
over
i
do
know
whether
it
is
over
i
know
that
if
it
does
not
return
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
it
do
you
see
alexey
petrovitch
how
much
good
you
have
done
perhaps
without
suspecting
it
yourself
by
the
way
do
you
know
i
feel
very
sorry
for
you
we
are
now
in
the
full
blaze
of
summer
the
days
are
exquisite
the
sky
blue
and
brilliant
it
could
be
lovelier
in
italy
even
and
you
are
staying
in
the
stifling
baking
town
and
walking
on
the
burning
pavement
what
induces
you
to
do
so
you
might
at
least
move
into
some
summer
villa
out
of
town
they
say
there
are
bright
spots
at
peterhof
on
the
i
should
like
to
write
more
to
you
but
it
impossible
such
a
sweet
fragrance
comes
in
from
the
garden
that
i
ca
stay
indoors
i
am
going
to
put
on
my
hat
and
go
for
a
walk
till
another
time
good
alexey
petrovitch
yours
devotedly
b
i
forgot
to
tell
you
only
fancy
that
witty
gentleman
about
whom
i
wrote
to
you
the
other
day
has
made
me
a
declaration
of
love
and
in
the
most
ardent
terms
i
thought
at
first
he
was
laughing
at
me
but
he
finished
up
with
a
formal
proposal
what
do
you
think
of
him
after
all
his
libels
but
he
is
positively
too
old
yesterday
evening
to
tease
him
i
sat
down
to
the
piano
before
the
open
window
in
the
moonlight
and
played
beethoven
it
was
so
nice
to
feel
its
cold
light
on
my
face
so
delicious
to
fill
the
fragrant
night
air
with
the
sublime
music
through
which
one
could
hear
at
times
the
singing
of
a
nightingale
it
is
long
since
i
have
been
so
happy
but
write
to
me
about
what
i
asked
you
at
the
beginning
of
my
letter
it
is
very
important
xii
from
alexey
petrovitch
to
marya
alexandrovna
petersburg
dear
marya
alexandrovna
here
is
my
opinion
in
a
couple
of
words
both
the
old
bachelor
and
the
young
suitor
overboard
with
them
both
there
is
no
need
even
to
consider
it
neither
of
them
is
worthy
of
you
that
as
clear
as
that
twice
two
makes
four
the
young
neighbour
is
very
likely
a
person
but
that
enough
about
him
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
him
and
you
and
you
can
fancy
how
amusing
it
would
be
for
you
to
live
together
besides
why
be
in
a
hurry
is
it
a
possible
thing
that
a
woman
like
you
i
do
want
to
pay
compliments
and
that
why
i
do
expatiate
further
that
such
a
woman
should
meet
no
one
who
would
be
capable
of
appreciating
her
no
marya
alexandrovna
listen
to
me
if
you
really
believe
that
i
am
your
friend
and
that
my
advice
is
of
use
but
confess
it
was
agreeable
to
see
the
old
scoffer
at
your
feet
if
i
had
been
in
your
place
i
have
kept
him
singing
beethoven
adelaïda
and
gazing
at
the
moon
the
whole
night
long
enough
of
them
though
your
adorers
it
not
of
them
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
am
in
a
strange
state
of
mind
in
consequence
of
a
letter
i
got
yesterday
i
am
enclosing
a
copy
of
it
to
you
this
letter
was
written
by
one
of
my
friends
of
long
ago
a
colleague
in
the
service
a
but
rather
limited
person
he
went
abroad
two
years
ago
and
till
now
has
not
written
to
me
once
here
is
his
he
is
very
alexis
i
am
in
naples
sitting
at
the
window
in
my
room
in
chiaja
the
weather
is
superb
i
have
been
staring
a
long
while
at
the
sea
then
i
was
seized
with
impatience
and
suddenly
the
brilliant
idea
entered
my
head
of
writing
a
letter
to
you
i
always
felt
drawn
to
you
my
dear
boy
on
my
honour
i
did
and
so
now
i
feel
an
inclination
to
pour
out
my
soul
into
your
bosom
that
how
one
expresses
it
i
believe
in
your
exalted
language
and
why
i
been
overcome
with
impatience
is
this
i
expecting
a
friend
a
woman
we
going
together
to
baiae
to
eat
oysters
and
oranges
and
see
the
tanned
shepherds
in
red
caps
dance
the
tarantella
to
bask
in
the
sun
like
lizards
in
short
to
enjoy
life
to
the
utmost
my
dear
boy
i
am
more
happy
than
i
can
possibly
tell
you
if
only
i
had
your
style
oh
what
a
picture
i
would
draw
for
you
but
unfortunately
as
you
are
aware
i
an
illiterate
person
the
woman
i
am
expecting
and
who
has
kept
me
now
more
than
a
hour
continually
starting
and
looking
at
the
door
loves
me
but
how
i
love
her
i
fancy
even
your
fluent
pen
could
not
describe
must
tell
you
that
it
is
three
months
since
i
got
to
know
her
and
from
the
very
first
day
of
our
acquaintance
my
love
mounts
continually
like
a
chromatic
scale
higher
and
higher
and
at
the
present
moment
i
am
simply
in
the
seventh
heaven
i
jest
but
in
reality
my
devotion
to
this
woman
is
something
extraordinary
supernatural
fancy
i
scarcely
talk
to
her
i
can
do
nothing
but
stare
at
her
and
laugh
like
a
fool
i
sit
at
her
feet
i
feel
that
awfully
silly
and
happy
simply
inexcusably
happy
it
sometimes
happens
that
she
lays
her
hand
on
my
head
well
i
tell
you
simply
but
there
you
ca
understand
it
you
a
philosopher
and
always
were
a
philosopher
her
name
is
nina
ninetta
as
you
like
she
the
daughter
of
a
rich
merchant
here
fine
as
any
of
your
raphaels
fiery
as
gunpowder
gay
so
clever
that
it
amazing
how
she
can
care
for
a
fool
like
me
she
sings
like
a
bird
and
her
eyes
excuse
this
unintentional
break
i
fancied
the
door
creaked
no
she
not
coming
yet
the
heartless
wretch
you
will
ask
me
how
all
this
is
going
to
end
and
what
i
intend
to
do
with
myself
and
whether
i
shall
stay
here
long
i
know
nothing
about
it
my
boy
and
i
do
want
to
what
will
be
will
be
why
if
one
were
to
be
for
ever
stopping
and
considering
she
running
up
the
staircase
singing
she
is
here
well
my
boy
no
time
for
you
now
i
so
sorry
she
has
bespattered
the
whole
letter
she
slapped
a
wet
nosegay
down
on
the
paper
for
the
first
moment
she
thought
i
was
writing
to
a
woman
when
she
knew
that
it
was
to
a
friend
she
told
me
to
send
her
greetings
and
ask
you
if
you
have
any
flowers
and
whether
they
are
sweet
well
if
you
could
hear
her
laughing
silver
ca
ring
like
it
and
the
in
every
note
of
it
you
want
to
kiss
her
little
feet
for
it
we
are
going
going
do
mind
the
untidy
smudges
and
envy
yours
the
letter
was
in
fact
bespattered
all
over
and
smelt
of
two
white
petals
had
stuck
to
the
paper
this
letter
has
agitated
me
i
remember
my
stay
in
naples
the
weather
was
magnificent
then
too
may
was
just
beginning
i
had
just
reached
but
i
knew
no
ninetta
i
sauntered
about
alone
consumed
with
a
thirst
for
bliss
at
once
torturing
and
sweet
so
sweet
that
it
was
as
it
were
like
bliss
itself
ah
what
is
it
to
be
young
i
remember
i
went
out
once
for
a
row
in
the
bay
there
were
two
of
us
the
boatman
and
i
what
did
you
imagine
what
a
night
it
was
and
what
a
sky
what
stars
how
they
quivered
and
broke
on
the
waves
with
what
delicate
flame
the
water
flashed
and
glimmered
under
the
oars
what
delicious
fragrance
filled
the
whole
sea
can
not
describe
this
though
my
style
may
be
in
the
harbour
was
a
french
ship
of
the
line
it
was
all
red
with
lights
long
streaks
of
red
the
reflection
of
the
lighted
windows
stretched
over
the
dark
sea
the
captain
of
the
ship
was
giving
a
ball
the
gay
music
floated
across
to
me
in
snatches
at
long
intervals
i
recall
in
particular
the
trill
of
a
little
flute
in
the
midst
of
the
deep
blare
of
the
trumpets
it
seemed
to
flit
like
a
butterfly
about
my
boat
i
bade
the
man
row
to
the
ship
twice
he
took
me
round
it
i
caught
glimpses
at
the
windows
of
women
figures
borne
gaily
round
in
the
of
the
waltz
i
told
the
boatman
to
row
away
far
away
straight
into
the
darkness
i
remember
a
long
while
the
music
persistently
pursued
me
at
last
the
sounds
died
away
i
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
in
the
dumb
agony
of
desire
stretched
out
my
arms
to
the
sea
oh
how
my
heart
ached
at
that
moment
how
bitter
was
my
loneliness
to
me
with
what
rapture
would
i
have
abandoned
myself
utterly
then
utterly
utterly
if
there
had
been
any
one
to
abandon
myself
to
with
what
a
bitter
emotion
in
my
soul
i
flung
myself
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
like
repetilov
asked
to
be
taken
anywhere
anywhere
away
but
my
friend
here
has
experienced
nothing
like
that
and
why
should
he
he
has
managed
things
far
more
wisely
than
i
he
is
living
while
i
he
may
well
call
me
a
philosopher
strange
they
call
you
a
philosopher
too
what
has
brought
this
calamity
on
both
of
us
i
am
not
living
but
who
is
to
blame
for
that
why
am
i
staying
on
here
in
petersburg
what
am
i
doing
here
why
am
i
wearing
away
day
after
day
why
do
i
go
into
the
country
what
is
amiss
with
our
steppes
has
not
one
free
breathing
space
in
them
is
one
cramped
in
them
a
strange
craze
to
pursue
dreams
when
happiness
is
perhaps
within
reach
resolved
i
am
going
going
if
i
can
i
am
going
home
that
is
to
you
it
just
the
same
we
only
twenty
versts
from
one
another
why
after
all
grow
stale
here
and
how
was
it
this
idea
did
not
strike
me
sooner
dear
marya
alexadrovna
we
shall
soon
see
each
other
it
extraordinary
though
that
this
idea
never
entered
my
head
before
i
ought
to
have
gone
long
long
ago
till
we
meet
marya
alexandrovna
i
purposely
gave
myself
hours
for
reflection
and
am
now
absolutely
convinced
that
i
have
no
reason
to
stay
here
the
dust
in
the
streets
is
so
penetrating
that
my
eyes
are
bad
i
am
beginning
to
pack
the
day
after
i
shall
most
likely
start
and
within
ten
days
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
i
trust
you
will
welcome
me
as
in
old
days
by
the
way
your
sister
is
still
staying
at
your
aunt
is
she
marya
alexandrovna
let
me
press
your
hand
warmly
and
say
from
my
heart
till
we
meet
i
had
been
getting
ready
to
go
away
but
that
letter
has
hastened
my
project
supposing
the
letter
proves
nothing
supposing
even
ninetta
would
not
please
any
one
else
me
for
instance
still
i
am
going
that
decided
now
till
we
meet
yours
xiii
from
marya
alexandrovna
to
alexey
petrovitch
village
of
x
you
are
coming
here
alexey
petrovitch
you
will
soon
be
with
us
eh
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
this
news
both
rejoices
and
disturbs
me
how
shall
we
meet
will
the
spiritual
tie
persist
which
as
it
seems
to
me
has
sprung
up
between
us
will
it
not
be
broken
by
our
meeting
i
do
know
i
feel
somehow
afraid
i
will
not
answer
your
last
letter
though
i
could
say
much
i
am
putting
it
all
off
till
our
meeting
my
mother
is
very
much
pleased
at
your
coming
she
knew
i
was
corresponding
with
you
the
weather
is
delicious
we
will
go
a
great
many
walks
and
i
will
show
you
some
new
places
i
have
discovered
i
especially
like
one
long
narrow
valley
it
lies
between
hillsides
covered
with
forest
it
seems
to
be
hiding
in
their
windings
a
little
brook
courses
through
it
scarcely
seeming
to
move
through
the
thick
grass
and
flowers
you
shall
see
come
perhaps
you
will
not
be
bored
i
think
you
will
not
see
my
sister
she
is
still
staying
at
my
aunt
i
fancy
but
this
is
between
ourselves
she
is
going
to
marry
a
very
agreeable
young
man
an
officer
why
did
you
send
me
that
letter
from
naples
life
here
can
not
help
seeming
dingy
and
poor
in
contrast
with
that
luxuriance
and
splendour
but
mademoiselle
ninetta
is
wrong
flowers
grow
and
smell
sweet
with
us
too
xiv
from
marya
alexandrovna
to
alexey
petrovitch
village
of
x
i
have
written
to
you
several
times
alexey
petrovitch
you
have
not
answered
are
you
living
or
perhaps
you
are
tired
of
our
correspondence
perhaps
you
have
found
yourself
some
diversion
more
agreeable
than
what
can
be
afforded
for
you
by
the
letters
of
a
provincial
young
lady
you
remembered
me
it
is
easy
to
see
simply
from
want
of
anything
better
to
do
if
that
so
i
wish
you
all
happiness
if
you
do
not
even
now
answer
me
i
will
not
trouble
you
further
it
only
remains
for
me
to
regret
my
indiscretion
in
having
allowed
myself
to
be
agitated
for
nothing
in
having
held
out
a
hand
to
a
friend
and
having
come
for
one
minute
out
of
my
lonely
corner
i
must
remain
in
it
for
ever
must
lock
myself
up
that
is
my
apportioned
lot
the
lot
of
all
old
maids
i
ought
to
accustom
myself
to
this
idea
it
useless
to
come
out
into
the
light
of
day
needless
to
wish
for
fresh
air
when
the
lungs
can
not
bear
it
by
the
way
we
are
now
hemmed
in
all
round
by
deadly
drifts
of
snow
for
the
future
i
will
be
wiser
people
do
die
of
dreariness
but
of
misery
perhaps
one
might
perish
if
i
am
wrong
prove
it
to
me
but
i
fancy
i
am
not
wrong
in
any
case
i
wish
you
all
happiness
xv
from
alexey
petrovitch
to
marya
alexandrovna
dresden
i
am
writing
to
you
my
dear
marya
alexandrovna
and
i
am
writing
only
because
i
do
not
want
to
die
without
saying
to
you
without
recalling
myself
to
your
memory
i
am
given
up
by
the
doctors
and
i
feel
myself
that
my
life
is
ebbing
away
on
my
table
stands
a
rose
before
it
withers
i
shall
be
no
more
this
comparison
is
not
however
altogether
an
apt
one
a
rose
is
far
more
interesting
than
i
am
as
you
see
abroad
it
is
now
six
months
since
i
have
been
in
dresden
i
received
your
last
letters
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
more
than
a
year
ago
i
lost
some
of
them
and
never
answered
them
i
will
tell
you
directly
why
but
it
seems
you
were
always
dear
to
me
to
no
one
but
you
have
i
any
wish
to
say
and
perhaps
i
have
no
one
else
to
take
leave
of
soon
after
my
last
letter
to
you
i
was
on
the
very
point
of
going
down
to
your
neighbourhood
and
had
made
various
plans
in
advance
an
incident
occurred
which
had
one
may
truly
say
a
great
influence
on
my
fate
so
great
an
influence
that
here
i
am
dying
thanks
to
that
incident
i
went
to
the
theatre
to
see
a
ballet
i
never
cared
for
ballets
and
for
every
sort
of
actress
singer
and
dancer
i
had
always
had
a
secret
feeling
of
repulsion
but
it
is
clear
there
no
changing
one
fate
and
no
one
knows
himself
and
one
can
not
foresee
the
future
in
reality
in
life
it
only
the
unexpected
that
happens
and
we
do
nothing
in
a
whole
lifetime
but
accommodate
ourselves
to
facts
but
i
seem
to
be
rambling
off
into
philosophising
again
an
old
habit
in
brief
i
fell
in
love
with
a
this
was
the
more
curious
as
one
could
not
even
call
her
a
beauty
it
is
true
she
had
marvellous
hair
of
ashen
gold
colour
and
great
clear
eyes
with
a
dreamy
and
at
the
same
time
daring
look
in
them
could
i
fail
to
know
the
expression
of
those
eyes
for
a
whole
year
i
was
pining
and
swooning
in
the
light
of
them
she
was
splendidly
and
when
she
danced
her
national
dance
the
audience
would
stamp
and
shout
with
delight
but
i
fancy
no
one
but
i
fell
in
love
with
her
at
least
no
one
was
in
love
with
her
as
i
was
from
the
very
minute
when
i
saw
her
for
the
first
time
would
you
believe
it
i
have
only
to
close
my
eyes
and
at
once
the
theatre
is
before
me
the
almost
empty
stage
representing
the
heart
of
a
forest
and
she
running
in
from
the
wing
on
the
right
with
a
wreath
of
vine
on
her
head
and
a
over
her
shoulders
from
that
fatal
moment
i
have
belonged
to
her
utterly
just
as
a
dog
belongs
to
its
master
and
if
now
that
i
am
dying
i
do
not
belong
to
her
it
is
only
because
she
has
cast
me
off
to
tell
the
truth
she
never
troubled
herself
particularly
about
me
she
scarcely
noticed
me
though
she
was
very
in
making
use
of
my
money
i
was
for
her
as
she
expressed
it
in
her
broken
french
rousso
boun
enfant
and
nothing
more
but
i
i
could
not
live
where
she
was
not
living
i
tore
myself
away
once
for
all
from
everything
dear
to
me
from
my
country
even
and
followed
that
woman
you
will
suppose
perhaps
that
she
had
brains
not
in
the
least
one
had
only
to
glance
at
her
low
brow
one
needed
only
one
glimpse
of
her
lazy
careless
smile
to
feel
certain
at
once
of
the
scantiness
of
her
intellectual
endowments
and
i
never
imagined
her
to
be
an
exceptional
woman
in
fact
i
never
for
one
instant
deceived
myself
about
her
but
that
was
of
no
avail
to
me
whatever
i
thought
of
her
in
her
absence
in
her
presence
i
felt
nothing
but
slavish
adoration
in
german
the
knights
often
fall
under
such
an
enchantment
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
her
features
i
could
never
tire
of
listening
to
her
talk
of
admiring
all
her
gestures
i
positively
drew
my
breath
as
she
breathed
however
she
was
unconstrained
too
unconstrained
indeed
did
not
give
herself
airs
as
actresses
generally
do
there
was
a
lot
of
life
in
her
that
is
a
lot
of
blood
that
splendid
southern
blood
into
which
the
sun
of
those
parts
must
have
infused
some
of
its
beams
she
slept
nine
hours
out
of
the
enjoyed
her
dinner
never
read
a
single
line
of
print
except
perhaps
the
newspaper
articles
in
which
she
was
mentioned
and
almost
the
only
tender
feeling
in
her
life
was
her
devotion
to
il
signore
carlino
a
greedy
little
italian
who
waited
on
her
in
the
capacity
of
secretary
and
whom
later
on
she
married
and
such
a
woman
i
could
fall
in
love
with
i
a
man
versed
in
all
sorts
of
intellectual
subtleties
and
no
longer
young
who
could
have
anticipated
it
i
at
least
never
anticipated
it
i
never
anticipated
the
part
i
was
to
play
i
never
anticipated
that
i
should
come
to
hanging
about
rehearsals
waiting
bored
and
frozen
behind
the
scenes
breathing
in
the
smut
and
grime
of
the
theatre
making
friends
with
all
sorts
of
utterly
unpresentable
persons
making
friends
did
i
say
cringing
slavishly
upon
them
i
never
anticipated
that
i
should
carry
a
shawl
buy
her
her
new
gloves
clean
her
old
ones
with
i
did
even
that
alas
carry
home
her
bouquets
hang
about
the
offices
of
journalists
and
editors
waste
my
substance
give
serenades
catch
colds
wear
myself
out
i
never
expected
in
a
little
german
town
to
receive
the
jeering
nickname
and
all
this
for
nothing
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
for
nothing
that
just
it
do
you
remember
how
we
used
in
talk
and
by
letter
to
reason
together
about
love
and
indulge
in
all
sort
of
subtleties
but
in
actual
life
it
turns
out
that
real
love
is
a
feeling
utterly
unlike
what
we
pictured
to
ourselves
love
indeed
is
not
a
feeling
at
all
it
a
malady
a
certain
condition
of
soul
and
body
it
does
not
develop
gradually
one
can
not
doubt
about
it
one
can
not
outwit
it
though
it
does
not
always
come
in
the
same
way
usually
it
takes
possession
of
a
person
without
question
suddenly
against
his
will
for
all
the
world
like
cholera
or
fever
it
clutches
him
poor
dear
as
the
hawk
pounces
on
the
chicken
and
bears
him
off
at
its
will
however
he
struggles
or
resists
in
love
there
no
equality
none
of
the
free
union
of
souls
and
such
idealisms
concocted
at
their
leisure
by
german
professors
no
in
love
one
person
is
slave
and
the
other
master
and
well
may
the
poets
talk
of
the
fetters
put
on
by
love
yes
love
is
a
fetter
and
the
heaviest
to
bear
at
least
i
have
come
to
this
conviction
and
have
come
to
it
by
the
path
of
experience
i
have
bought
this
conviction
at
the
cost
of
my
life
since
i
am
dying
in
my
slavery
what
a
life
mine
has
been
if
you
think
of
it
in
my
first
youth
nothing
would
satisfy
me
but
to
take
heaven
by
storm
for
myself
then
i
fell
to
dreaming
of
the
good
of
all
humanity
of
the
good
of
my
country
then
that
passed
too
i
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
making
a
home
family
life
for
myself
and
so
tripped
over
an
and
plop
down
into
the
grave
ah
we
great
hands
we
russians
at
making
such
a
finish
but
it
time
to
turn
away
from
all
that
it
long
been
time
may
this
burden
be
loosened
from
off
my
soul
together
with
life
i
want
for
the
last
time
if
only
for
an
instant
to
enjoy
the
sweet
and
gentle
feeling
which
is
shed
like
a
soft
light
within
me
directly
i
think
of
you
your
image
is
now
doubly
precious
to
me
with
it
rises
up
before
me
the
image
of
my
country
and
i
send
to
it
and
to
you
a
farewell
greeting
live
live
long
and
happily
and
remember
one
thing
whether
you
remain
in
the
wilds
of
the
steppes
where
you
have
sometimes
been
so
sorrowful
but
where
i
should
so
like
to
spend
my
last
days
or
whether
you
enter
upon
a
different
career
remember
life
deceives
all
but
him
who
does
not
reflect
upon
her
and
demanding
nothing
of
her
accepts
serenely
her
few
gifts
and
serenely
makes
the
most
of
them
go
forward
while
you
can
but
if
your
strength
fails
you
sit
by
the
wayside
and
watch
those
that
pass
by
without
anger
or
envy
they
too
have
not
far
to
go
in
old
days
i
did
not
tell
you
this
but
death
will
teach
any
one
though
who
says
what
is
life
what
is
truth
do
you
remember
who
it
was
made
no
reply
to
that
question
farewell
marya
alexandrovna
farewell
for
the
last
time
and
do
not
remember
evil
against
poor
alexey
