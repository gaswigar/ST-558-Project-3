the
war
trail
the
hunt
of
the
wild
horse
by
captain
mayne
reid
this
book
along
with
several
other
of
this
author
occupies
an
important
position
in
the
history
of
english
literature
for
it
was
one
of
the
first
to
deal
with
the
wild
west
the
events
take
place
shortly
after
the
mexican
war
of
the
late
the
mexicans
themselves
have
been
conquered
but
now
it
is
necessary
to
protect
them
from
a
further
enemy
one
who
would
war
with
both
americans
and
mexicans
the
comanche
indians
the
troop
of
rangers
consists
of
many
kinds
of
men
of
scots
irish
english
german
swiss
polish
descent
and
many
others
some
of
these
take
major
roles
in
this
story
and
their
words
are
reported
just
as
they
would
have
been
said
numerous
extremely
difficult
situations
are
encountered
and
it
is
often
the
woodcraft
and
ingenuity
of
these
men
that
gets
them
out
of
them
sometimes
in
extremely
for
you
and
me
unexpected
ways
this
results
in
a
series
of
tense
incidents
and
though
the
literary
style
is
a
bit
unusual
they
are
very
gripping
many
books
by
this
author
were
published
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
some
of
them
were
printed
with
rather
damaged
type
the
copy
of
this
book
that
we
worked
from
was
one
of
these
so
there
may
well
be
a
very
few
typos
left
for
which

of
some

have
i
sweet
memories
of
thee
for
who
could
traverse
thy
fields
without
beholding
some
fair
flower
ever
after
to
be
borne
upon
his
bosom
and
yet
not
all
my
souvenirs
are
glad
pleasant
and
painful
sweet
and
sad
they
thrill
my
heart
with
alternate
throes
but
the
sad
emotions
have
been
tempered
by
time
and
the
glad
ones
at
each
returning
tide
seem
tinged
with
brighter
glow
in
thy
bowers
as
elsewhere
roses
must
be
plucked
from
thorns
but
in
memory
mellowed
light
i
see
not
the
thorns
i
behold
only

beautiful

a
mexican
frontier
village
a
mexican
on
the
banks
of
the
rio
bravo
del
norte
a
mere
or
hamlet
the
quaint
old
church
of
style
with
its
cupola
of
motley
japan
the
residence
of
the
and
the
house
of
the
are
the
only
stone
structures
in
the
place
these
constitute
three
sides
of
the
piazza
a
somewhat
spacious
square
the
remaining
side
is
taken
up
with
shops
or
dwellings
of
the
common
people
they
are
built
of
large
unburnt
bricks
some
of
them
washed
with
lime
others
gaudily
coloured
like
the
proscenium
of
a
theatre
but
most
of
them
uniform
in
their
muddy
and
forbidding
brown
all
have
heavy
doors
and
windows
without
glass
or
sash
the
of
iron
bars
set
vertically
opposes
the
burglar
not
the
weather
from
the
four
corners
of
the
piazza
narrow
unpaved
dusty
lanes
lead
off
to
the
country
for
some
distance
bordered
on
both
sides
by
the
adobe
houses
still
farther
out
on
the
skirts
of
the
village
and
sparsely
placed
are
dwellings
of
frailer
build
but
more
picturesque
appearance
they
are
structures
of
the
split
trunks
of
that
gigantic
lily
the
arborescent
yucca
its
branches
form
the
rafters
its
tough
fibrous
leaves
the
thatch
in
these
dwell
the
poor
peons
the
descendants
of
the
conquered
race
the
stone
dwellings
and
those
of
mud
likewise
are
tiled
or
cemented
sometimes
tastefully
japanned
with
a
parapet
running
round
the
edge
this
flat
roof
is
the
characteristic
of
mexican
architecture
when
the
sun
is
low
and
the
evening
cool
the
azotea
is
a
pleasant
especially
when
the
proprietor
of
the
house
has
a
taste
for
flowers
then
it
is
converted
into
an
aerial
garden
and
displays
the
rich
flora
for
which
the
of
mexico
is
justly
celebrated
it
is
just
the
place
to
enjoy
a
cigar
a
glass
of
or
if
you
prefer
it
the
smoke
is
wafted
away
and
the
open
air
gives
a
relish
to
the
beverage
besides
your
eye
is
feasted
you
enjoy
the
privacy
of
a
while
you
command
what
is
passing
in
the
street
the
slight
parapet
gives
security
while
hindering
a
too
free
view
from
below
you
see
without
being
seen
the
world
moves
on
busied
with
earthly
affairs
and
does
not
think
of
looking
up
i
stand
upon
such
an
azotea
it
is
that
over
the
house
of
the
alcalde
and
his
being
the
tallest
roof
in
the
village
i
command
a
view
of
all
the
others
i
can
see
beyond
them
all
and
note
the
prominent
features
of
the
surrounding
country
my
eye
wanders
with
delight
over
the
deep
rich
verdure
of
its
tropic
vegetation
i
can
even
distinguish
its
more
characteristic
forms
the
cactus
the
yucca
and
the
agave
i
observe
that
the
village
is
girdled
by
a
belt
of
open
ground
cultivated
fields
where
the
maize
waves
its
silken
tassels
in
the
breeze
contrasting
with
the
darker
leaves
of
the
capsicums
and
frijoles
this
open
ground
is
of
limited
extent
the
with
its
thorny
thicket
of
acacias
mimosae
ingas
and
robinias
a
perfect
maze
of
leguminous
trees
hems
it
in
and
so
near
is
the
verge
of
this
jungle
that
i
can
distinguish
its
undergrowth
of
stemless
palms
and
bromelias
the
and
scarlet
leaves
of
the
plant
shining
in
the
distance
like
lists
of
fire
this
propinquity
of
the
forest
to
the
little
pueblita
bespeaks
the
indolence
of
the
inhabitants
perhaps
not
it
must
be
remembered
that
these
people
are
not
agriculturists
but
herdsmen
and
that
the
glades
and
openings
of
that
thick
chapparal
are
speckled
with
herds
of
fierce
spanish
cattle
and
droves
of
small
andalusian
horses
of
the
race
of
the
barb
the
fact
of
so
little
cultivation
does
not
abnegate
the
existence
of
industry
on
the
part
of
the
villagers
grazing
is
their
occupation
not
farming
only
a
little
of
the
latter
to
give
them
maize
for
their
chile
to
season
it
with
and
black
beans
to
complete
the
repast
these
three
with
the
beef
of
their
wide
pastures
constitute
the
staple
of
food
throughout
all
mexico
for
drink
the
denizen
of
the
high
find
his
favourite
beverage
the
rival
of
champagne
in
the
core
of
the
gigantic
aloe
while
he
of
the
tropic
refreshes
himself
from
the
juice
of
another
native
endogen
the
acrocomia
palm
favoured
land
ceres
loves
thee
and
bacchus
too
to
thy
fields
both
the
god
and
the
goddess
have
been
freely
bounteous
food
and
drink
may
be
had
from
them
on
easy
terms
alas
as
in
all
other
lands
one
only
excepted
nature
divine
views
have
been
thwarted
her
aim
set
aside
by
the
malignity
of
man
as
over
the
broad
world
the
blight
of
the
despot
is
upon
thy
beauty
why
are
these
people
crowded
together
hived
as
it
were
in
towns
and
villages
herdsmen
one
would
expect
to
find
them
scattered
by
reason
of
their
occupation
besides
a
sky
continually
bright
a
genial
clime
a
picturesqueness
of
scene
all
seem
to
invite
to
rural
life
and
yet
i
have
ridden
for
hours
a
succession
of
lovely
landscapes
rising
before
my
eyes
all
of
them
wild
wanting
in
that
one
feature
which
makes
the
rural
picture
perfect
the
house
the
dwelling
of
man
towns
there
are
and
at
long
intervals
the
huge
of
the
landed
lord
walled
in
like
a
fortress
but
where
are
the
the
homes
of
the
common
people
true
i
have
noticed
the
ruins
of
many
and
that
explains
the
puzzle
i
remember
now
that
i
am
on
the
that
for
years
past
the
banks
of
the
rio
bravo
from
its
source
to
the
sea
have
been
hostile
ground
a
of
fifteen
hundred
miles
in
length
many
a
red
conflict
has
occurred
is
still
occurring
between
those
arabs
of
the
american
desert
the
indians
and
the
descendants
of
the
spaniard
that
is
why
the
ranchos
exist
only
in
ruins
that
is
why
the
haciendas
are
loopholed
and
the
populace
pent
up
within
walls
the
condition
of
feudal
europe
exists
in
free
america
on
the
banks
of
the
rio
bravo
del
norte
nearly
a
mile
off
looking
westward
i
perceive
the
sheen
of
water
it
is
a
reach
of
the
great
river
that
glances
under
the
setting
sun
the
river
curves
at
that
point
and
the
summit
of
a
gentle
hill
half
girdled
by
the
stream
is
crowned
by
the
low
white
walls
of
a
hacienda
though
only
one
story
high
this
hacienda
appears
from
its
extent
and
the
style
of
its
architecture
to
be
a
noble
mansion
like
all
of
its
class
it
is
but
the
parapet
is
crenated
and
small
ornamental
turrets
over
the
angles
and
the
great
gateway
relieve
the
monotony
of
its
outlines
a
larger
tower
the
belfry
of
a
chapel
appears
in
the
background
the
mexican
hacienda
is
usually
provided
with
its
little
for
the
convenient
worship
of
the
peon
retainers
the
emblems
of
religion
such
as
it
is
are
thick
over
the
land
the
glimmer
of
glass
behind
the
iron
rejas
relieves
to
some
extent
the
aspect
so
characteristic
of
mexican
this
is
further
modified
by
the
appearance
over
the
parapet
of
green
foliage
forms
of
tropic
vegetation
show
above
the
wall
among
others
the
graceful
curving
fronds
of
a
palm
this
must
be
an
exotic
for
although
the
lower
half
of
the
rio
bravo
is
within
the
zone
of
the
palms
the
species
that
grow
so
far
north
are
and
this
one
is
of
far
different
form
with
pinnate
fronds
of
the
character
of
or
i
note
the
fact
not
from
any
botanical
curiosity
with
which
it
inspires
me
but
rather
because
the
presence
of
this
exotic
palm
has
a
significance
it
illustrates
a
point
in
the
character
of
him
it
may
be
who
is
the
presiding
spirit
of
the
place
no
doubt
there
is
a
fair
garden
upon
the
azotea
perhaps
a
fair
being
among
its
flowers
pleasant
thoughts
spring
up
anticipations
i
long
to
climb
that
sloping
hill
to
enter
that
splendid
mansion
and
longing
still
i
gaze
the
ring
of
a
bugle
startles
me
from
this
pleasant
reverie
is
only
a
but
it
has
driven
sweet
reflections
out
of
my
mind
and
my
eyes
are
turned
away
from
the
bright
mansion
and
rest
upon
the
piazza
of
the
pueblita
there
a
far
different
scene
greets
their
glance
chapter
three
the
rangers
on
picket
the
centre
of
the
piazza
presents
a
salient
point
in
the
picture
there
the
well
with
its
gigantic
wheel
its
huge
leathern
belt
and
buckets
its
trough
of
cemented
offers
an
oriental
aspect
verily
it
is
the
persian
wheel
is
odd
to
a
northern
eye
to
find
such
a
structure
in
this
western
land
but
the
explanation
is
easy
the
persian
wheel
has
travelled
from
egypt
along
the
southern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
with
the
moors
it
crossed
the
straits
of
gibraltar
and
the
spaniard
has
carried
it
over
the
atlantic
the
reader
of
the
sacred
volume
will
find
many
a
familiar
passage
illustrated
in
the
customs
of
mexico
the
genius
of
the
arab
has
shaped
many
a
thought
for
the
brain
of
the
aztec
my
eye
rests
not
long
upon
the
well
but
turns
to
gaze
on
the
scene
of
active
life
that
is
passing
near
and
around
it
forms
and
varied
ones
i
trow
are
moving
there
gliding
with
silent
step
and
dubious
look
his
wide
flapping
around
his
ankles
his
arms
and
shoulders
shrouded
in
the
mottled
serape
his
black
hat
darkening
still
more
his
swarth
face
goes
the
the
denizen
of
the
adobe
hut
he
shuns
the
centre
of
the
piazza
keeping
around
the
walls
but
at
intervals
his
eyes
are
turned
towards
the
well
with
a
look
of
mingled
fierceness
and
fear
he
reaches
a
doorway
it
is
silently
opened
by
a
hand
within
he
enters
quickly
and
seems
glad
to
get
out
of
sight
a
little
afterwards
i
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
sombre
face
dimly
visible
behind
the
bars
of
the
reja
at
distant
corners
i
descry
small
groups
of
his
class
all
similarly
costumed
in
calzoneros
striped
blankets
and
glaze
hats
all
like
him
wearing
uneasy
looks
they
gesticulate
little
contrary
to
their
usual
habit
and
converse
only
in
whispers
or
low
mutterings
unusual
circumstances
surround
them
most
of
the
women
are
within
doors
a
few
of
the
poorer
class
of
pure
indian
race
are
seated
in
the
piazza
they
are
hucksters
and
their
wares
are
spread
before
them
on
a
thin
mat
while
another
similar
one
supported
on
a
stem
screens
them
and
their
merchandise
from
the
sun
their
dyed
woollen
garments
their
bare
heads
their
coarse
black
hair
adorned
with
twists
of
scarlet
worsted
impart
to
them
somewhat
of
a
gipsy
look
they
appear
as
free
of
care
as
the
zingali
themselves
they
laugh
and
chatter
and
show
their
white
teeth
all
day
long
asking
each
to
purchase
their
fruits
and
vegetables
their
and
their
not
unmusical
voices
ring
pleasantly
upon
the
ear
now
and
then
a
young
girl
with
red
poised
upon
her
crown
trips
lightly
across
the
piazza
in
the
direction
of
the
well
perhaps
she
is
a
one
of
the
belles
of
the
village
in
petticoat
embroidered
but
sleeveless
chemisette
with
small
satin
slippers
upon
her
feet
head
shoulders
and
bosom
shrouded
in
the
arms
and
ankles
bare
several
of
these
may
be
seen
passing
to
and
fro
they
appear
less
uneasy
than
the
men
they
even
smile
at
intervals
and
reply
to
the
rude
badinage
uttered
in
an
unknown
tongue
by
the
strangers
around
the
well
the
mexican
women
are
courageous
as
they
are
amiable
as
a
race
their
beauty
is
undeniable
but
who
are
these
strangers
they
do
not
belong
to
the
place
that
is
evident
and
equally
so
that
they
are
objects
of
terror
to
those
who
do
at
present
they
are
masters
here
their
numbers
their
proud
confident
swagger
and
the
bold
loud
tone
of
their
conversation
attest
that
they
are
masters
of
the
ground
who
are
they
i
have
styled
them
and
the
phrase
is
to
be
taken
in
its
full
significance
a
more
set
of
fellows
never
mustered
in
a
mexican
piazza
nor
elsewhere
there
are
fourscore
of
them
and
but
that
each
carries
a
yager
rifle
in
his
hand
a
knife
in
his
belt
and
a
colt
pistol
on
his
thigh
you
could
not
discover
the
slightest
point
of
resemblance
between
any
two
of
them
their
arms
are
the
only
things
about
them
denoting
and
some
sort
of
organisation
for
the
rest
they
are
as
unlike
one
another
as
the
various
shapes
and
hues
of
coarse
broadcloth
woollen
jeans
cottonades
coloured
blankets
and
buckskin
can
make
them
they
wear
caps
of
and
and
squirrel
hats
of
beaver
and
felt
and
glaze
of
wool
and
palmetto
of
every
imaginable
shape
and
slouch
even
of
the
modern
monster
the
silken
tile
samples
might
be
seen
there
are
coats
of
broadcloth
few
in
number
and
well
worn
but
many
are
the
garments
of
kentucky
jeans
of
of
nigger
cloth
and
cottonade
some
wear
coats
made
of
green
blankets
others
of
blue
ones
and
some
of
a
scarlet
red
there
are
of
dressed
deerskin
with
plaited
skirt
and
cape
fringed
and
jauntily
adorned
with
beads
and
embroidery
the
favourite
style
of
the
backwoods
hunter
but
others
there
are
of
true
indian
cut
open
only
at
the
throat
and
hanging
loose
or
fastened
around
the
waist
with
a
belt
the
same
that
secures
the
knife
and
pistol
there
are
cloth
jackets
too
such
as
are
worn
by
sailors
and
others
of
cottonade
the
costume
of
the
creole
of
louisiana
some
of
leather
the
of
the
and
still
another
fashion
the
embroidered
spencer
of
the
mexican
ranchero
some
shoulders
are
covered
by
serapes
and
some
by
the
more
graceful
and
manga
look
lower
down
examine
the
limbs
of
the
men
of
this
motley
band
the
covering
of
these
is
not
less
varied
than
their
upper
garments
you
see
wrappers
of
coarse
cloth
of
flannel
and
of
baize
they
are
blue
and
scarlet
and
green
you
see
leggings
of
raw
hide
and
of
buckskin
boots
of
reaching
to
the
thighs
nigger
boots
of
still
coarser
fabric
with
the
pantaloons
tucked
under
of
unstained
and
moccasins
of
varied
cut
betokening
the
fashion
of
more
than
one
indian
tribe
you
may
see
limbs
encased
in
calzoneros
and
others
in
the
heavy
stamped
leather
of
the
mexican
horseman
resembling
the
greaves
of
warriors
of
the
olden
time
the
heels
of
all
are
armed
though
their
armature
is
as
varied
as
the
costumes
there
are
spurs
of
silver
and
steel
some
plated
and
some
with
the
plating
worn
off
some
strapped
and
others
screwed
into
the
heel
of
the
boot
some
light
with
small
rowels
and
tiny
teeth
while
others
are
seen
the
heavy
spur
of
mexico
of
several
pounds
weight
with
rowels
five
inches
in
diameter
and
teeth
that
might
be
dashed
through
the
ribs
of
a
horse
cruel
weapons
of
the

these
spurs
in
the
piazza
these
botas
and
calzoneros
these
mangas
and
serapes
are
not
worn
by
their
present
wearers
are
men
of
a
different
race
most
of
those
tall
stalwart
bodies
are
the
product
of
the
of
kentucky
and
tennessee
or
the
buckwheat
and
of
the
fertile
flats
of
ohio
indiana
and
the
illinois
they
are
the
squatters
and
hunters
of
the
backwoods
the
farmers
of
the
great
western
slopes
of
the
alleghanies
the

of

gay
city
spark
from
the
larger
towns
of
the
great
west
yes
and
from
other
sources
are
individuals
of
that
mixed
band
i
recognise
the
teutonic
type
the
fair
hair
and
moustache
of
the
german
the
florid
englishman
the
staid
scot
and
his
contrast
the
noisy
hibernian
both
equally
brave
i
behold
the
adroit
and
nimble
frenchman
full
of
laugh
and
chatter
the
stanch
soldierly
swiss
and
the
moustached
exile
of
poland
dark
sombre
and
silent
what
a
study
for
an
ethnologist
is
that
band
of
men
who
are
they
you
have
thrice
asked
the
question
i
answer
it
they
are
a
corps
of
rangers
guerilla
of
the
american
and
who
am
i
i
am
their
captain
their
chief
yes
i
am
the
leader
of
that
queer
crew
and
despite
their
rough
motley
aspect
i
dare
affirm
that
not
in
europe
not
in
america
elsewhere
not
upon
the
great
globe
surface
can
be
found
a
band
of
like
numbers
to
equal
them
in
strength
daring
and
warlike
intelligence
many
of
them
have
spent
half
a
life
in
the
sharpening
practice
of
border
warfare
indian
or
mexican
and
from
these
the
others
have
learnt
some
have
been
gentlemen
upon
whom
fortune
has
frowned
a
few
have
been
desperadoes
within
the
pale
of
civilised
life
and
a
smaller
few
perhaps
beyond
it
bad
materials
wherewith
to
not
so
bad
if
you
go
but
to
rude
as
is
the
of
the
corps
i
am
proud
to
say
that
a
high
sentiment
of
honour
pervades
it
higher
than
will
be
found
in
the
picked
de
of
an
emperor
true
they
appear
rough
and
reckless
terrible
i
might
say
for
most
of
them
with
their
long
beards
and
hair
faces
slouched
hats
and
odd
habiliments
belted
as
they
are
with
knife
pistol
and
pouch
present
such
an
aspect
but
you
would
wrong
them
to
take
them
as
they
look
few
among
them
are
the
pure
bandits
whose
aim
is
plunder
many
a
noble
heart
beats
beneath
a
rude
exterior
many
a
one
truly
humane
there
are
hearts
in
that
band
that
throb
under
the
influence
of
patriotism
some
are
guided
by
a
still
nobler
impulse
a
desire
to
extend
the
area
of
freedom
others
it
is
true
yearn
but
for
revenge
these
last
are
chiefly
texans
who
mourn
a
friend
or
brother
slain
by
mexican
treachery
they
have
not
forgotten
the
cowardly
assassination
of
goliad
they
remember
the
red
butchery
of
the
alamo
perhaps
i
alone
of
all
the
band
have
no
motive
for
being
here
if
one
slight
scarce
so
noble
as
vengeance
mere
chance
the
love
of
excitement
and
adventure
perhaps
some
weak
fondness
for
power
and
fame
are
all
the
excuses
i
can
urge
for
taking
a
hand
in
this
affair
a
poor
adventurer
without
friends
without
home
without
country
for
my
native
land
is
no
more
a
nation
my
heart
is
not
cheered
by
a
single
throb
of
patriotism
i
have
no
private
wrong
to
redress
no
public
cause
no
country
for
which
to
combat
during
intervals
of
inaction
these
thoughts
recur
to
me
and
give
me
pain
the
men
have
picketed
their
horses
in
the
church
enclosure
some
are
tied
to
trees
and
others
to
the
of
the
windows

riders

a

weeks
ago
was

all
be
seen
in
the

of
two
distinct
races
the
large
gaunt
mule
of

of
the
soil
my
own
black
steed
with
his
pretty
muzzle
stands
near
the
fountain
in
the
centre
of
the
piazza
my
eye
wanders
with
a
sort
of
habitual
delight
over
the
oval
outlines
of
his
body
how
proudly
he
curves
his
swan
like
neck
and
with
mock
anger
paws
up
the
dust
he
knows
that
my
eyes
are
upon
him
we
have
been
scarcely
an
hour
in
the
rancheria
we
are
perfect
strangers
to
it
we
are
the
first
american
troop
its
people
have
yet
seen
although
the
war
has
been
going
on
for
some
months
farther
down
the
river
we
have
been
despatched
upon
scouting
duty
with
orders
to
scour
the
surrounding
country
as
far
as
it
is
safe
the
object
in
sending
us
hither
is
not
so
much
to
guard
against
a
surprise
from
our
mexican
foe
who
is
not
upon
this
side
but
to
guard
the
mexicans
from
another
enemy
an
enemy
of
of
the
comanche
these
indian
ishmaelites
report
says
are
upon
the
and
have
quite
an
army
in
the
field
it
is
said
they
are
foraging
higher
up
the
river
where
they
have
it
all
to
themselves
and
have
just
pillaged
a
settlement
in
that
direction
butchered
the
men
as
is
their
wont
and
carried
off
the
women
children
and
chattels
we
came
hither
to
conquer
the
mexicans
but
we
must
while
them
de
chapter
four
making
a
captive
i
was
musing
upon
the
singular
character
of
this
war
when
my
reverie
was
disturbed
by
the
hoof
strokes
of
a
horse
the
sounds
came
from
a
distance
outside
the
village
the
strokes
were
those
of
a
horse
at
full
gallop
i
stepped
hastily
across
the
azotea
and
looked
over
the
parapet
in
hopes
of
obtaining
a
view
of
this
rapid
rider
i
was
not
disappointed
as
i
neared
the
wall
the
road
and
the
rider
came
full
under
my
eyes
in
the
latter
i
beheld
a
picturesque
object
he
appeared
to
be
a
very
young
man
a
mere
youth
without
beard
or
moustache
but
of
singularly
handsome
features
the
complexion
was
dark
almost
brown
but
even
at
the
distance
of
two
hundred
yards
i
could
perceive
the
flash
of
a
noble
eye
and
note
a
damask
redness
upon
his
cheeks
his
shoulders
were
covered
with
a
scarlet
manga
that
draped
backward
over
the
hips
of
his
horse
and
upon
his
head
he
wore
a
light
sombrero
laced
banded
and
tasselled
with
bullion
of
gold
the
horse
was
a
small
but
finely
proportioned
mustang
spotted
like
a
jaguar
upon
a
ground
colour
of
cream
a
true
andalusian
the
horseman
was
advancing
at
a
gallop
without
fear
of
the
ground
before
him
by
chance
his
eyes
were
raised
to
the
level
of
the
azotea
on
which
i
stood
my
uniform
and
the
sparkle
of
my
accoutrements
caught
his
glance
and
quick
as
thought
as
if
by
an
involuntary
movement
he
reined
up
his
mustang
until
its
ample
tail
lay
clustered
upon
the
dust
of
the
road
it
was
then
that
i
noted
the
singular
appearance
of
both
horse
and
rider
just
at
that
moment
the
ranger
who
held
picket
on
that
side
of
the
village
sprang
forth
from
his
and
challenged
the
horseman
to
halt
the
challenge
was
unheeded
another
jerk
of
the
rein
spun
the
mustang
round
as
upon
a
pivot
and
the
next
instant
impelled
by
the
spur
the
animal
resumed
his
gallop
he
did
not
return
by
the
road
but
shot
off
in
a
new
direction
nearly
at
right
angles
to
his
former
course
a
would
have
followed
and
most
likely
have
stopped
the
career
of
either
horse
or
rider
had
not
i
just
in
the
nick
of
time
shouted
to
the
sentry
to
hold
his
fire
a
reflection
had
occurred
to
me
the
game
was
too
noble
too
beautiful
to
be
butchered
by
a
bullet
it
was
worth
a
chase
and
a
capture
my
horse
was
by
the
i
had
noticed
that
he
was
not
yet
unsaddled
and
the
bridle
was
still
on
he
had
been
warmed
by
the
morning
scout
and
i
had
ordered
my
negro
groom
to
walk
him
round
for
an
hour
or
so
before
letting
him
at
the
water
i
did
not
wait
to
descend
by
the
i
sprang
upon
the
parapet
and
from
that
into
the
piazza
the
groom
perceiving
my
intention
met
me
with
the
horse
i
seized
the
reins
and
bounded
into
the
saddle
several
of
the
readiest
of
the
rangers
followed
my
example
and
as
i
galloped
down
the
lane
that
led
out
of
the
rancheria
i
could
tell
by
the
clattering
of
hoofs
that
of
them
were
at
my
heels
i
cared
not
much
for
that
for
surely
i
was
a
match
for
the
stripling
we
meant
to
chase
i
knew
moreover
that
speed
at
the
moment
was
of
more
importance
than
strength
and
that
if
the
spotted
horse
possessed
as
much
bottom
as
he
evidently
did
heels
his
rider
and
i
would
have
it
to
ourselves
in
the
end
i
knew
that
all
the
horses
of
my
troop
were
less
swift
than
my
own
and
from
the
springs
i
had
witnessed
on
the
part
of
the
mustang
i
felt
satisfied
that
it
remained
only
for
me
to
overhaul
him
my
springing
down
from
the
roof
and
up
into
the
saddle
had
occupied
scarcely
two
minutes
time
and
in
two
more
i
had
cleared
the
houses
and
was
scouring
across
the
fields
after
the
scarlet
horseman
he
was
evidently
making
to
get
round
the
village
and
continue
the
journey
our
presence
had
so
suddenly
interrupted
the
chase
led
through
a
field
of
my
horse
sank
deeply
in
the
loose
earth
while
the
lighter
mustang
bounded
over
it
like
a
hare
he
was
distancing
me
and
i
began
to
fear
i
should
lose
him
when
all
at
once
i
saw
that
his
course
was
intercepted
by
a
list
of
magueys
running
transversely
right
and
left
the
plants
were
of
luxuriant
growth
eight
or
ten
feet
high
and
placed
alternately
so
that
their
huge
hooked
blades
interlocked
with
each
other
forming
a
natural
this
barrier
at
first
glance
seemed
impassable
for
either
man
or
horse
it
brought
the
mexican
to
a
halt
he
was
turning
to
skirt
it
when
he
perceived
that
i
had
leaned
into
the
diagonal
line
and
could
not
fail
to
head
him
with
a
quick
wrench
upon
the
rein
he
once
more
wheeled
round
set
his
horse
against
the
magueys
plied
the
spur
and
dashed
right
into
their
midst
in
a
moment
both
horse
and
rider
were
out
of
sight
but
as
i
spurred
up
to
the
spot
i
could
hear
the
thick
blades
crackle
under
the
hoofs
of
the
mustang
there
was
no
time
for
reflection
i
must
either
follow
or
abandon
the
pursuit
the
alternative
was
not
thought
of
i
was
on
my
honour
my
steed
upon
his
mettle
and
without
halt
we
went
plunging
through
the
magueys
torn
and
bleeding
we
came
out
on
the
opposite
side
and
i
perceived
to
my
satisfaction
that
i
had
made
better
time
than
the
red
rider
before
me
his
halt
had
lessened
the
distance
between
us
but
another
field
of
milpas
had
to
be
passed
and
he
was
again
gaining
upon
me
as
we
galloped
over
the
heavy
ground
when
nearly
through
the
field
i
perceived
something
glancing
before
us
it
was
water
a
wide
drain
or
ditch
a
for
irrigating
the
field
like
the
magueys
it
ran
transversely
to
our
course
that
will
stop
him
thought
i
he
must
take
to
the
right
or
left
and
then
my
thoughts
were
interrupted
instead
of
turning
either
to
right
or
left
the
mexican
headed
his
horse
at
the
zequia
and
the
noble
creature
rushing
forward
rose
like
a
bird
upon
the
wing
and
cleared
the
canal
i
had
no
time
to
expend
in
admiring
the
feat
i
hastened
to
imitate
it
and
galloping
forward
i
set
myself
for
the
leap
my
brave
steed
needed
neither
whip
nor
spur
he
had
seen
the
other
leap
the
zequia
and
he
knew
what
was
expected
of
him
with
a
bound
he
went
over
clearing
the
drain
by
several
feet
and
then
as
if
resolved
upon
bringing
the
affair
to
an
end
he
laid
his
head
forward
and
stretched
himself
at
speed
a
broad
grassy
plain
a
savannah
lay
before
us
and
the
hoofs
of
both
horses
pursuer
and
pursued
now
rang
upon
hard
firm
turf
the
rest
of
the
chase
would
have
been
a
simple
trial
of
speed
and
i
made
sure
of
overhauling
the
mustang
before
he
could
reach
the
opposite
side
when
a
new
obstacle
presented
itself
a
vast
herd
of
cattle
and
horses
studded
the
savannah
throughout
its
whole
extent
these
startled
by
our
wild
gallop
tossed
their
heads
and
ran
affrighted
in
every
direction
but
frequently
as
otherwise
directly
in
our
way
more
than
once
i
was
forced
to
rein
in
to
save
my
neck
or
my
horse
from
being
broken
over
a
fierce
bull
or
a
lumbering
ox
and
more
than
once
i
was
compelled
to
swerve
from
my
course
what
vexed
me
most
was
that
in
this
zigzag
race
the
mustang
from
practice
perhaps
had
the
advantage
and
while
it
continued
he
increased
his
distance
we
cleared
the
drove
at
length
but
to
my
chagrin
i
perceived
that
we
were
nearly
across
the
plain
as
i
glanced
ahead
i
saw
the
chapparal
near
with
taller
trees
rising
over
it
beyond
i
saw
the
swell
of
a
hill
with
white
walls
upon
its
summit
it
was
the
hacienda
already
mentioned
we
were
riding
directly
towards
it
i
was
growing
anxious
about
the
result
should
the
horseman
reach
the
thicket
i
would
be
almost
certain
to
lose
him
dared
not
let
him
what
would
my
men
say
if
i
went
back
without
him
i
had
hindered
the
sentry
from
firing
and
permitted
to
escape
perhaps
a
spy
perhaps
some
important
personage
his
desperate
efforts
to
get
off
favoured
the
supposition
that
he
was
one
or
the
other
must
be
under
fresh
impulse
derived
from
these
reflections
i
lanced
the
flanks
of
my
horse
more
deeply
than
ever
moro
seemed
to
divine
my
thoughts
and
stretched
himself
to
his
utmost
there
were
no
more
cattle
not
an
obstacle
and
his
superior
speed
soon
lessened
the
distance
between
himself
and
the
mustang
ten
seconds
more
would
do
it
the
ten
seconds
flew
by
i
felt
myself
within
shooting
distance
i
drew
my
pistol
from
its
holster
o
yo
halt
or
i
fire
i
cried
aloud
there
was
no
reply
the
mustang
kept
on
halt
i
cried
again
unwilling
to
take
the
life
of
a
halt
or
you
are
a
dead
man
no
reply
again
there
were
not
six
yards
between
myself
and
the
mexican
horseman
riding
straight
behind
him
i
could
have
sent
a
bullet
into
his
back
some
secret
instinct
restrained
me
it
was
partly
though
not
altogether
a
feeling
of
admiration
there
was
an
indefinable
idea
in
my
mind
at
the
moment
my
finger
rested
on
the
trigger
and
i
could
not
draw
it
he
must
not
escape
he
is
nearing
the
trees
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
enter
the
thicket
i
must
cripple
the
horse
i
looked
for
a
place
to
aim
at
his
hips
were
towards
me
should
i
hit
him
there
he
might
still
get
off
where
should
i
aim
at
this
moment
the
animal
wheeled
as
if
guided
by
his
own
impulse
perhaps
by
the
knees
of
his
rider
and
shot
off
in
a
new
direction
the
object
of
this
manoeuvre
was
to
throw
me
out
of
the
track
so
far
it
was
successful
but
it
gave
me
just
the
opportunity
to
aim
as
i
wanted
as
it
brought
the
mustang
side
towards
me
and
levelling
my
pistol
i
sent
a
bullet
through
his
kidneys
a
single
plunge
forward
was
his
last
and
both
horse
and
rider
came
to
the
ground
in
an
instant
the
latter
had
disengaged
himself
from
his
struggling
steed
and
stood
upon
his
feet
fearing
that
he
might
still
endeavour
to
escape
to
the
cover
of
the
thicket
i
spurred
forward
pistol
in
hand
and
pointed
the
weapon
at
his
head
but
he
made
no
attempt
either
at
further
flight
or
resistance
on
the
contrary
he
stood
with
folded
arms
fronting
the
levelled
tube
and
looking
me
full
in
the
face
said
with
an
air
of
perfect
coolness
matame
amigo
soy
do
not
kill
me
friend
i
am
a
woman
chapter
five
my
captive
not
kill
me
friend
i
am
a
this
declaration
scarcely
astonished
me
i
was
half
prepared
for
it
during
our
wild
gallop
i
had
noticed
one
or
two
circumstances
which
led
me
to
suspect
that
the
spy
i
pursued
was
a
female
as
the
mustang
sprung
over
the
zequia
the
flowing
skirt
of
the
manga
was
puffed
upward
and
hung
for
some
moments
spread
out
in
the
air
a
velvet
bodice
beneath
a
skirt
the
of
the
form
all
impressed
me
as
singular
for
a
cavallero
however
rich
and
young
the
limbs
i
could
not
see
as
the
were
drawn
over
them
but
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
gold
spur
and
a
heel
of
a
tiny
red
boot
to
which
it
was
attached
the
clubbed
hair
too
loosened
by
the
violent
motion
had
fallen
backward
and
in
two
thick
plaits
slightly
dishevelled
rested
upon
the
croup
of
the
horse
a
young
indian
might
have
been
equally
as
long
but
tresses
would
have
been
and
whereas
those
under
my
eyes
were
soft
silky
and
neither
the
style
of
riding
la
duchesse
de
nor
the
manlike
costume
of
manga
and
hat
were
averse
to
the
idea
that
the
rider
was
a
woman
both
the
style
and
costume
are
common
to
the
of
mexico
moreover
as
the
mustang
made
his
last
double
i
had
caught
a
near
view
of
the
side
face
of
the
rider
the
features
of
no
man
not
of
the
trojan
shepherd
not
of
adonis
or
endymion
were
so
exquisitely
chiselled
as
they
certainly
a
woman
her
declaration
at
once
put
an
end
to
my
conjectures
but
as
i
have
said
did
not
astonish
me
i
astonished
however
by
its
tone
and
manner
instead
of
being
uttered
in
accents
of
alarm
it
was
pronounced
as
coolly
as
if
the
whole
thing
had
been
a
jest
sadness
not
supplication
was
the
prevailing
tone
which
was
further
carried
out
as
she
knelt
to
the
ground
pressed
her
lips
to
the
muzzle
of
the
still
breathing
mustang
and
exclaimed
pobre
yegua
muerte
alas
me
poor
mare
dead
dead
a
woman
said
i
feigning
astonishment
my
interrogatory
was
unheeded
she
did
not
even
look
up
pobre
yegua
lola
she
repeated
as
coolly
as
if
the
dead
mustang
was
the
only
object
of
her
thoughts
and
i
the
armed
assassin
fifty
miles
from
the
spot
a
woman
i
again
ejaculated
in
my
embarrassment
scarcely
knowing
what
to
say
senor
nada
quiere
yes
sir
nothing
more
what
do
you
want
as
she
made
this
reply
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
confronting
me
without
the
slightest
semblance
of
fear
so
unexpected
was
the
answer
both
in
tone
and
sentiment
that
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
help
breaking
into
a
laugh
you
are
merry
sir
you
have
made
sad
you
have
killed
my
favourite
i
shall
not
easily
forget
the
look
that
accompanied
these
words
sorrow
anger
contempt
defiance
were
expressed
in
one
and
the
same
glance
my
laughter
was
suddenly
checked
i
felt
humiliated
in
that
proud
presence
senorita
i
replied
i
deeply
regret
the
necessity
i
have
been
under
it
might
have
been
worse
and
how
pray
how
worse
demanded
she
interrupting
me
my
pistol
might
have
been
aimed
at
but
for
a
suspicion
cried
she
again
interrupting
me
it
could
not
have
been
worse
i
loved
that
creature
dearly
dearly
as
i
do
my
life
i
love
my
and
as
she
thus
wildly
expressed
herself
she
bent
down
passed
her
arms
around
the
neck
of
the
mustang
and
once
more
pressed
her
lips
to
its
velvet
muzzle
then
gently
closing
its
eyelids
she
rose
to
an
erect
attitude
and
stood
with
folded
arms
regarding
the
lifeless
form
with
a
sad
and
bitter
expression
of
countenance
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
i
was
in
a
dilemma
with
my
fair
captive
i
would
have
given
a
month
of
my
payroll
to
have
restored
the
spotted
mustang
to
life
but
as
that
was
out
of
the
question
i
bethought
me
of
some
means
of
making
restitution
to
its
owner
an
offer
of
money
would
not
be
delicate
what
then
a
thought
occurred
to
me
that
promised
to
relieve
me
from
my
embarrassment
the
eagerness
of
the
rich
mexicans
to
obtain
our
large
american
horses
as
they
term
them
was
well
known
throughout
the
army
fabulous
prices
were
often
paid
for
them
by
these
who
wanted
them
for
display
upon
the
we
had
many
good
bloods
in
the
troop
one
of
these
thought
i
might
be
acceptable
even
to
a
lady
who
had
lost
her
pet
i
made
the
offer
as
delicately
as
i
could
it
was
rejected
with
scorn
what
senor
cried
she
striking
the
ground
with
her
foot
till
the
rowels
rang
what
a
horse
to
me
she
continued
pointing
to
the
plain
look
there
sir
there
are
a
thousand
horses
they
are
mine
now
know
the
value
of
your
offer
do
i
stand
in
need
of
a
horse
but
senorita
stammered
i
apologisingly
these
are
horses
of
native
race
the
one
i
propose
to
bah
she
exclaimed
interrupting
me
and
pointing
to
the
mustang
i
would
not
have
exchanged
for
all
the
frisones
in
your
troop
not
one
of
them
was
its
equal
a
personal
slight
would
not
have
called
forth
a
contradiction
yet
this
defiance
had
that
effect
she
had
touched
the
chord
of
my
vanity
i
might
almost
say
of
my
affection
with
some
pique
i
replied
senorita
i
looked
towards
moro
as
i
spoke
her
eyes
followed
mine
and
she
stood
for
some
moments
gazing
at
him
in
silence
i
watched
the
expression
of
her
eye
i
saw
it
kindle
into
admiration
as
it
swept
over
the
gracefully
curving
outlines
of
my
noble
steed
he
looked
at
the
moment
superb
the
short
skurry
had
drawn
the
foam
from
his
lips
and
flakes
of
it
clung
against
his
neck
and
counter
contrasting
finely
with
the
shining
black
of
his
skin
his
sides
heaved
and
fell
in
regular
undulations
and
the
smoke
issued
from
his
nostrils
his
eye
was
still
on
fire
and
his
neck
proudly
arched
as
though
conscious
of
his
late
triumph
and
the
interest
he
was
now
exciting
for
a
long
while
she
stood
gazing
upon
him
and
though
she
spoke
not
a
word
i
saw
that
she
recognised
his
fine
points
you
are
right
cavallero
she
said
at
length
and
thoughtfully
he
just
then
a
series
of
reflections
were
passing
through
my
mind
that
rendered
me
extremely
uncomfortable
and
i
felt
regret
that
i
had
so
pointedly
drawn
her
attention
to
the
horse
would
she
demand
that
was
the
thought
that
troubled
me
i
had
not
promised
her
horse
in
my
troop
and
moro
i
would
not
have
given
for
her
herd
of
a
thousand
but
on
the
strength
of
the
offer
i
had
made
what
if
she
should
fancy
the
circumstances
were
awkward
for
a
refusal
indeed
under
any
circumstances
refusal
would
have
been
painful
i
began
to
feel
that
i
could
deny
her
nothing
this
proud
beautiful
woman
already
my
interest
with
my
position
was
a
delicate
one
fortunately
i
was
relieved
from
it
by
an
incident
that
carried
our
thoughts
into
a
new
current
the
troopers
who
had
followed
me
at
that
moment
rode
up
she
seemed
uneasy
at
their
presence
that
could
not
be
wondered
at
considering
their
wild
garb
and
fierce
looks
i
ordered
them
back
to
their
quarters
they
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
fallen
mustang
with
its
rich
trappings
at
its
late
rider
and
her
picturesque
garments
and
then
muttering
a
few
words
to
one
another
obeyed
the
order
i
was
once
more
alone
with
my
captive
chapter
six
isolina
de
vargas
as
soon
as
the
men
were
out
of
hearing
she
said
interrogatively
some
of
them
are
texans
not
all
you
are
their
chief
i
am
capitan
i
presume
that
is
my
rank
and
now
senor
capitan
am
i
your
captive
the
question
took
me
by
surprise
and
for
the
moment
i
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
the
excitement
of
the
chase
the
encounter
and
its
curious
developments
perhaps
above
all
other
things
the
bewitching
beauty
of
my
captive
had
driven
out
of
my
mind
the
whole
purpose
of
the
pursuit
and
for
some
minutes
i
had
not
been
thinking
of
any
result
the
interrogatory
reminded
me
that
i
had
a
delicate
duty
to
perform
was
this
lady
a
such
a
supposition
was
by
no
means
improbable
as
my
old
campaigner
can
testify
fair
ladies
though
never
one
so
fair
as
she
have
ere
now
served
their
country
in
this
fashion
she
may
be
the
bearer
of
some
important
dispatch
for
the
enemy
if
so
and
i
permit
her
to
go
free
the
consequences
may
be
serious
unpleasant
even
to
myself
so
ran
my
reflections
on
the
other
hand
i
disliked
the
duty
of
taking
her
back
a
prisoner
i
feared
to
execute
it
i
dreaded
displeasure
wished
to
be
friends
with
i
felt
the
influence
of
that
mysterious
power
which
transcends
all
strength
the
power
of
beauty
i
had
been
but
ten
minutes
in
the
company
of
this
maiden
and
already
she
controlled
my
heart
as
though
she
had
been
its
mistress
for
life
i
knew
not
how
to
reply
she
saw
that
i
hesitated
and
again
put
the
question
am
i
your
captive
i
fear
senorita
i
am
i
was
prompted
to
this
declaration
partly
to
escape
from
a
direct
answer
and
partly
giving
way
to
the
passion
already
fast
gathering
in
my
bosom
it
was
no
coquetry
on
my
part
no
desire
to
make
a
pretty
passage
of
words
though
i
spoke
only
from
impulse
i
was
serious
and
with
no
little
anxiety
did
i
watch
the
effect
of
my
speech
her
large
lustrous
eyes
rested
upon
me
at
first
with
a
puzzled
expression
this
gradually
changed
to
one
of
more
significance
one
that
pleased
me
better
she
seemed
for
a
moment
to
throw
aside
her
indifference
and
regard
me
with
more
attention
i
fancied
from
the
glance
she
gave
that
she
was
contented
with
what
i
had
said
for
all
that
the
slight
curl
upon
her
pretty
lip
had
a
provoking
air
of
triumph
in
it
and
she
resumed
her
proud
as
she
replied
come
cavallero
this
is
idle
compliment
am
i
free
to
go
i
wavered
betwixt
duty
and
a
compromise
offered
itself
lady
said
i
approaching
her
and
looking
as
seriously
as
i
could
into
her
beautiful
eyes
if
you
give
me
your
word
that
you
are
a
you
are
free
to
go
your
word
i
ask
nothing
more
i
prescribed
these
conditions
rather
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
than
command
i
affected
sternness
but
my
countenance
must
have
mocked
me
my
captive
broke
into
unrestrained
laughter
crying
out
at
intervals
i
a
spy
a
spy
ha
ha
ha
senor
capitan
you
are
jesting
i
hope
senorita
are
in
earnest
you
are
no
spy
then
you
bear
no
dispatch
for
our
enemy
nothing
of
the
sort
mio
capitan
and
she
continued
her
light
laughter
why
then
did
you
try
to
make
away
from
us
ah
cavallero
are
you
not
tejanos
do
not
be
offended
when
i
tell
you
that
your
people
bear
but
an
indifferent
reputation
among
us
mexicans
but
your
attempt
to
escape
was
to
say
the
least
rash
and
imprudent
you
risked
life
by
it
yes
i
perceive
i
did
and
she
looked
significantly
at
the
mustang
while
a
bitter
smile
played
upon
her
lips
i
perceive
it
now
i
did
not
then
i
did
not
think
there
was
a
horseman
in
all
your
troop
could
come
up
with
me
there
was
have
overtaken
me
could
have
done
it
as
she
uttered
these
words
her
large
brown
eyes
were
once
more
turned
upon
me
not
in
a
fixed
gaze
but
wandering
she
scanned
me
from
the
on
my
crown
to
the
spur
upon
my
heel
i
watched
her
eye
with
eager
interest
i
fancied
that
its
scornful
expression
was
giving
way
i
fancied
there
was
a
ray
of
tenderness
in
the
glance
i
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
divined
her
thoughts
at
that
moment
our
eyes
met
and
parted
in
mutual
embarrassment
at
least
i
fancied
so
for
on
turning
again
i
saw
that
her
head
drooped
and
her
gaze
was
directed
downward
as
if
some
new
thought
occupied
her
for
some
moments
both
were
silent
we
might
have
remained
longer
thus
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
acting
rudely
the
lady
was
still
my
captive
i
had
not
yet
given
her
permission
to
depart
i
hastened
to
tender
it
spy
or
no
spy
senorita
i
shall
not
detain
you
i
shall
bear
the
risk
you
are
free
to
go
i
and
now
since
you
have
behaved
so
handsomely
i
shall
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
the
read
she
handed
me
a
folded
paper
at
a
glance
i
recognised
the
of
the
enjoining
upon
all
to
respect
its
bearer
the
isolina
de
you
perceive
mio
capita
i
was
not
your
captive
after
all
ha
ha
ha
lady
you
are
too
general
not
to
pardon
the
rudeness
to
which
you
have
been
subjected
freely
capitan
freely
i
shudder
at
thought
of
the
risk
you
have
run
why
did
you
act
with
such
imprudence
your
sudden
flight
at
sight
of
our
picket
caused
suspicion
and
of
course
it
was
our
duty
to
follow
and
capture
you
with
the
safeguard
you
had
no
cause
for
flight
ha
it
was
that
very
that
caused
me
to
fly
the
senorita
pray
explain
can
i
trust
prudence
capitan
i
promise
know
then
that
i
was
not
certain
you
were
for
aught
i
could
see
you
might
have
been
a
guerilla
of
my
how
would
it
be
if
this
paper
and
sundry
others
i
carry
were
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
caiales
you
perceive
capitan
we
fear
our
more
than
our
i
now
fully
comprehended
the
motive
of
her
flight
you
speak
spanish
too
well
mio
capitan
continued
she
had
you
cried
in
your
native
tongue
i
should
at
once
have
pulled
up
and
perhaps
saved
my
pet
ah
me
yegua
pobre
as
she
uttered
the
last
exclamation
her
feelings
once
more
overcame
her
and
sinking
down
upon
her
knees
she
passed
her
arms
around
the
neck
of
the
mustang
now
stiff
and
cold
her
face
was
buried
in
the
long
thick
mane
and
i
could
perceive
the
tears
sparkling
like
over
the
tossed
hair
she
continued
i
have
good
cause
to
grieve
i
had
reason
to
love
you
well
more
than
once
you
saved
me
from
the
fierce
lipan
and
the
brutal
comanche
what
am
i
to
do
now
i
dread
the
indian
foray
i
shall
tremble
at
every
sign
of
the
savage
i
dare
no
more
venture
upon
the
prairie
i
dare
not
go
abroad
i
must
tamely
stay
at
home
you
were
my
wings
they
are
clipped
i
fly
no
more
all
this
was
uttered
in
a
tone
of
extreme
bitterness
and
i
i
who
so
loved
my
own
brave
steed
could
appreciate
her
feelings
with
the
hope
of
imparting
even
a
little
consolation
i
repeated
my
offer
senorita
i
said
i
have
swift
horses
in
my
troop
some
of
noble
race
you
have
no
horse
in
your
troop
i
value
you
have
not
seen
them
all
all
every
one
of
them
as
you
filed
out
of
the
city
indeed
indeed
yes
noble
capitan
i
saw
you
as
you
carried
yourself
so
cavalierly
at
the
head
of
your
troop
of
ha
ha
ha
senorita
i
saw
not
you
it
was
not
for
the
want
of
using
your
eyes
there
was
not
a
or
into
which
you
did
not
glance
not
a
smile
in
the
whole
street
you
did
not
seem
anxious
to
reciprocate
ha
ha
ha
i
fear
senor
capitan
you
are
the
don
juan
de
tenorio
of
the
north
lady
it
is
not
my
character
nonsense
you
are
proud
of
it
i
never
saw
man
who
was
not
but
come
a
truce
to
badinage
about
the
horse
you
have
none
in
your
troop
i
value
save
i
trembled
as
she
spoke
it
is
she
continued
pointing
to
moro
i
felt
as
if
i
should
sink
into
the
earth
my
embarrassment
prevented
me
for
some
time
from
replying
she
noticed
my
hesitation
but
remained
silent
awaiting
my
answer
senorita
i
stammered
out
at
length
that
steed
is
a
great
favourite
an
old
and
tried
friend
you
desire
to
possess
him
he
is
he
is
at
your
service
in
emphasising
the
if
i
was
appealing
to
her
generosity
it
was
to
no
purpose
thank
you
she
replied
coolly
he
shall
be
well
cared
for
no
doubt
he
will
serve
my
purpose
is
his
i
was
choking
with
vexation
and
could
not
reply
i
began
to
hate
her
let
me
try
him
continued
she
ah
you
have
a
curb
bit
that
will
do
but
it
is
not
equal
to
ours
i
use
a
mameluke
help
me
to
that
lazo
she
pointed
to
a
lazo
of
white
horsehair
beautifully
plaited
that
was
coiled
upon
the
saddle
of
the
mustang
i
unloosed
the
rope
mechanically
i
did
and
in
the
same
way
adjusted
it
to
the
horn
of
my
saddle
i
noticed
that
the
was
of
silver
i
shortened
the
leathers
to
the
proper
length
now
capitan
cried
she
gathering
the
reins
in
her
small
gloved
hand
now
i
shall
see
how
he
performs
at
the
word
she
bounded
into
the
saddle
her
small
foot
scarcely
touching
the
stirrup
she
had
thrown
off
her
manga
and
her
form
was
now
displayed
in
all
its
undulating
outlines
the
silken
skirt
draped
down
to
her
ankles
and
underneath
appeared
the
tiny
red
boot
the
glancing
spur
and
the
lace
ruffle
of
her
a
scarlet
sash
encircled
her
waist
with
its
fringed
ends
drooping
to
the
saddle
and
the
tight
bodice
lashed
with
lace
displayed
the
full
rounding
of
her
bosom
as
it
rose
and
fell
in
quiet
regular
breathing
for
she
seemed
in
no
way
excited
or
nervous
her
full
round
eye
expressed
only
calmness
and
courage
i
stood
transfixed
with
admiration
i
thought
of
the
amazons
were
they
beautiful
like
her
with
a
troop
of
such
warriors
one
might
a
a
bull
moved
by
curiosity
or
otherwise
had
separated
from
the
herd
and
was
seen
approaching
the
spot
where
we
were
this
was
just
what
the
fair
rider
wanted
at
a
touch
of
the
spur
the
horse
sprang
forward
and
galloped
directly
for
the
bull
the
latter
cowed
at
the
sudden
onset
turned
and
ran
but
his
swift
pursuer
soon
came
within
lazo
distance
the
noose
circled
in
the
air
and
launched
forward
was
seen
to
settle
around
the
horns
of
the
animal
the
horse
was
now
wheeled
round
and
headed
in
an
opposite
direction
the
rope
tightened
with
a
sudden
pluck
and
the
bull
was
thrown
with
violence
to
the
plain
where
he
lay
stunned
and
apparently
lifeless
before
he
had
time
to
recover
himself
the
rider
turned
her
horse
trotted
up
to
the
prostrate
animal
bent
over
in
the
saddle
unfastened
the
noose
and
after
coiling
the
rope
under
her
arm
came
galloping
back
superb
magnificent
she
exclaimed
leaping
from
the
saddle
and
gazing
at
the
steed
beautiful
most
beautiful
ah
lola
poor
lola
i
fear
i
shall
soon
forget
thee
the
last
words
were
addressed
to
the
mustang
then
turning
to
me
she
added
and
this
horse
is
mine
yes
lady
if
you
will
it
i
replied
somewhat
cheerlessly
for
i
felt
as
if
my
best
friend
was
about
to
be
taken
from
me
but
i
do
will
it
said
she
with
an
air
of
determination
and
then
breaking
into
a
laugh
she
cried
out
ha
capitan
i
know
your
thoughts
think
you
i
can
not
appreciate
the
sacrifice
you
would
make
keep
your
favourite
enough
that
one
of
us
should
suffer
and
she
pointed
to
the
mustang
keep
the
brave
black
you
well
know
how
to
ride
him
were
he
mine
no
mortal
could
influence
me
to
part
with
him
there
is
who
could
influence
as
i
said
this
i
looked
anxiously
for
the
answer
it
was
not
in
words
i
expected
it
but
in
the
glance
assuredly
there
was
no
frown
i
even
fancied
i
could
detect
a
smile
a
blending
of
triumph
and
satisfaction
it
was
and
my
heart
fell
again
under
her
light
laugh
ha
ha
ha
that
one
is
of
course
your
well
noble
capitan
if
you
are
as
true
to
her
as
to
you
brave
steed
she
will
have
no
cause
to
doubt
your
fealty
i
must
leave
you
adios
shall
i
not
be
permitted
to
accompany
you
to
your
home
no
senor
i
am
at
home
my
father
house
she
pointed
to
the
hacienda
here
is
one
who
will
look
to
the
remains
of
poor
lola
and
she
signalled
to
a
vaquero
at
that
moment
coming
from
the
herd
remember
capitan
you
are
an
enemy
i
must
not
accept
your
politeness
neither
may
i
offer
you
hospitality
ah
you
know
not
us
you
know
not
the
tyrant
santa
anna
perhaps
even
at
this
moment
his
spies
are
she
glanced
suspiciously
around
as
she
spoke
o
heavens
she
exclaimed
with
a
start
as
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
form
of
a
man
advancing
down
the
hill
it
is
ijurra
ijurra
only
my
cousin
but
she
hesitated
and
then
suddenly
changing
to
an
expression
of
entreaty
she
continued
o
leave
me
senor
amor
leave
me
adieu
adieu
though
i
longed
to
have
a
nearer
view
of
ijurra
the
hurried
earnestness
of
her
manner
overcame
me
and
without
making
other
reply
than
a
simple
adios
i
vaulted
into
the
saddle
and
rode
off
on
reaching
the
border
of
the
woods
curiosity
a
stronger
feeling
perhaps
mastered
my
politeness
and
under
the
pretence
of
adjusting
my
stirrup
i
turned
in
the
saddle
and
glanced
back
ijurra
had
arrived
upon
the
ground
i
beheld
a
tall
dark
man
dressed
in
the
usual
costume
of
the
ricos
of
mexico
dark
cloth
blue
military
trousers
with
scarlet
sash
around
his
waist
and
hat
upon
his
head
he
appeared
about
thirty
years
of
age
whiskered
moustached
and
after
a
fashion
handsome
it
was
not
his
age
nor
his
personal
appearance
nor
yet
his
costume
that
had
my
attention
at
the
moment
i
watched
only
his
actions
he
stood
confronting
his
cousin
or
rather
he
stood
her
for
she
appeared
before
him
in
an
attitude
of
fear
he
held
a
paper
in
one
hand
and
i
saw
he
was
pointing
to
it
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
fierce
expression
upon
his
face
and
even
in
the
distance
i
could
tell
from
the
tones
of
his
voice
that
he
was
talking
angrily
why
should
she
fear
why
submit
to
such
rude
rebuke
he
must
have
a
strange
power
over
that
spirit
who
could
force
it
thus
tamely
to
listen
to
reproach
these
were
my
reflections
my
impulse
was
to
drive
the
spurs
into
the
sides
of
my
horse
and
gallop
back
upon
the
ground
i
might
have
done
so
had
the
scene
lasted
much
longer
but
i
saw
the
lady
suddenly
leave
the
spot
and
walk
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
hacienda
i
wheeled
round
again
and
plunging
under
the
shadows
of
the
forest
soon
fell
into
a
road
leading
to
the
rancheria
with
my
thoughts
full
of
the
incident
that
had
just
transpired
i
rode
unconsciously
leaving
my
horse
to
his
own
guidance
my
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
challenge
of
one
of
my
own
sentries
which
admonished
me
that
i
had
arrived
at
the
entrance
of
the
village
chapter
seven
an
order
to
forage
my
adventure
did
not
end
with
the
day
it
was
continued
into
the
night
and
repeated
in
my
dreams
i
rode
the
chase
over
again
i
dashed
through
the
magueys
i
leaped
the
and
galloped
through
the
affrighted
herd
i
beheld
the
spotted
mustang
stretched
lifeless
upon
the
plain
its
rider
bending
and
weeping
over
it
that
face
of
rare
beauty
that
form
of
exquisite
proportion
that
eye
rotund
and
noble
that
tongue
so
free
and
heart
so
bold
all
were
again
encountered
in
dreamland
a
dark
face
was
in
the
vision
and
at
intervals
crossed
the
picture
like
a
cloud
it
was
the
face
of
ijurra
i
think
it
was
that
awoke
me
but
the
of
the
bugle
was
ringing
in
my
ears
as
i
leaped
from
my
couch
for
some
moments
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
adventure
had
been
a
dream
an
object
that
hung
on
the
opposite
wall
came
under
my
eyes
and
recalled
the
reality
it
was
my
saddle
over
the
holsters
of
which
lay
a
coil
of
white
horsehair
rope
with
a
silver
ring
at
the
end
i
remembered
the
lazo
when
fairly
awake
i
reviewed
my
yesterday
adventure
from
first
to
last
i
tried
to
think
calmly
upon
it
i
tried
to
get
it
out
of
my
thoughts
and
return
seriously
to
my
duties
a
vain
attempt
the
more
i
reflected
upon
the
incident
the
more
i
became
conscious
of
the
powerful
interest
its
heroine
had
excited
within
me
interest
indeed
say
rather
a
passion
that
in
one
single
hour
had
grown
as
large
as
my
heart
it
was
not
love
of
my
life
i
was
nigh
thirty
years
of
age
i
had
been
enamoured
before
more
than
once
it
may
be
and
i
understood
what
the
feeling
was
i
needed
no
cupid
to
tell
me
i
was
in
love
again
to
the
very
ends
of
my
fingers
to
paint
the
object
of
my
passion
is
a
task
i
shall
not
attempt
beauty
like
hers
must
be
left
to
the
imagination
think
of
the
woman
you
love
or
have
loved
fancy
her
in
her
fairest
moments
in
bower
or
boudoir
perchance
a
blushing
bride
and
you
may
form
some
idea
no
no
no
you
could
never
have
looked
upon
woman
so
lovely
as
isolina
de
vargas
oh
that
i
could
fix
that
fleeting
phantom
of
beauty
that
i
could
paint
that
likeness
for
the
world
to
admire
it
can
not
be
the
most
puissant
pen
is
powerless
the
brightest
colour
too
cold
though
deeply
graven
upon
the
tablet
of
my
heart
i
can
not
multiply
the
impression
it
is
idle
to
talk
of
wavy
hair
profuse
and
glossed
of
almond
eyes
with
long
dark
fringes
of
teeth
and
cheeks
tinted
with
damascene
all
these
had
she
but
they
are
not
peculiar
characteristics
other
women
are
thus
gifted
the
traits
of
beauty
lay
in
the
intellectual
as
much
as
the
physical
in
a
happy
combination
of
both
the
soul
the
spirit
had
its
share
in
producing
this
incomparable
picture
it
was
to
behold
the
play
of
those
noble
features
to
watch
the
changing
cheek
the
varying
smile
the
falling
lash
the
flashing
eye
the
glance
now
tender
now
sublime
it
was
to
look
on
all
this
and
be
impressed
with
an
idea
of
the
divinest
loveliness
as
i
ate
my
frugal
breakfast
such
a
vision
was
passing
before
me
i
contemplated
the
future
with
pleasant
hopes
but
not
without
feelings
of
uneasiness
i
had
not
forgotten
the
abrupt
parting
no
invitation
to
renew
the
acquaintance
no
hope
no
prospect
that
i
should
ever
behold
that
beautiful
woman
again
unless
blind
chance
should
prove
my
friend
i
am
not
a
fatalist
and
i
therefore
resolved
not
to
rely
upon
mere
destiny
but
if
possible
to
help
it
a
little
in
its
evolution
before
i
had
finished
my
coffee
a
dozen
schemes
had
passed
through
my
mind
all
tending
towards
one
object
the
renewal
of
my
acquaintance
with
isolina
de
vargas
unless
favoured
by
some
lucky
accident
or
what
was
more
desirable
the
lady
i
knew
we
might
never
meet
again
in
such
times
it
was
not
likely
she
would
be
much
and
in
a
few
days
hours
perhaps
i
might
be
ordered
never
more
to
return
to
that
interesting
outpost
as
the
district
was
of
course
under
martial
law
and
i
was
dictator
you
will
imagine
that
i
might
easily
have
procured
the
right
of
entry
anywhere
not
so
whatever
be
the
licence
of
the
mere
soldier
as
regards
the
common
people
of
a
conquered
country
the
position
of
the
officer
with
its
higher
class
is
essentially
different
if
a
gentleman
he
naturally
feels
a
delicacy
in
making
any
advances
towards
an
acquaintance
and
his
honour
restrains
him
from
the
freer
forms
of
introduction
to
take
advantage
of
his
position
of
power
would
be
a
positive
meanness
of
which
a
true
gentleman
can
not
be
guilty
besides
there
may
be
rancour
on
the
part
of
the
conquered
there
usually
is
but
even
when
no
such
feeling
exists
another
barrier
stands
in
the
way
of
free
association
between
the
officer
and
society
the
latter
feels
that
the
position
of
affairs
will
not
be
permanent
the
enemy
will
in
time
evacuate
and
then
the
vengeance
of
is
to
be
dreaded
never
did
the
ricos
of
mexico
feel
more
secure
than
while
under
the
protection
of
the
american
army
many
of
them
were
disposed
to
be
friendly
but
the
phantom
of
the
future
with
its
mob
stared
them
in
the
face
and
under
this
dread
they
were
forced
to
adopt
a
hypocritical
exclusiveness
epaulettes
must
not
be
seen
glancing
through
the
windows
of
their
under
such
circumstances
my
situation
was
difficult
enough
i
might
gaze
upon
the
outside
walls
of
that
handsome
hacienda
till
my
heart
ached
but
how
was
i
to
effect
an
entrance
to
charge
a
fort
a
battery
an
intrenched
camp
to
storm
a
castle
or
break
a
solid
square
one
or
all
would
have
been
child
play
compared
with
the
difficulty
of
crossing
that
glacial
line
of
etiquette
that
separated
me
from
my
beautiful
enemy
to
effect
this
purpose
a
dozen
schemes
were
passed
through
my
mind
and
rejected
till
my
eyes
at
length
rested
upon
the
most
interesting
object
in
the
apartment
the
little
white
rope
that
hung
from
my
saddlebow
in
the
lazo
i
recognised
my
that
pretty
implement
must
be
returned
to
its
owner
myself
should
take
it
so
far
should
be
guided
by
beyond
i
should
have
to
put
my
trust
in
destiny
i
think
best
under
the
influence
of
a
cigar
and
lighting
one
i
ascended
to
the
azotea
to
complete
my
little
scheme
i
had
scarcely
made
two
turns
of
the
roof
when
a
horseman
galloped
into
the
piazza
he
was
in
dragoon
uniform
and
i
soon
perceived
he
was
an
orderly
from
headquarters
inquiring
for
the
commandant
of
the
outpost
one
of
the
men
pointed
to
me
and
the
orderly
trotting
forward
drew
up
in
front
of
the
alcalde
house
and
announced
that
he
was
the
bearer
of
a
dispatch
from
the
at
the
same
time
showing
a
folded
paper
i
directed
him
to
pass
it
up
on
the
point
of
his
sabre
which
he
did
and
then
saluting
me
he
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back
as
he
had
come
i
opened
the
dispatch
and
read
army
of
sir
you
will
take
a
sufficient
number
of
your
men
and
proceed
to
the
hacienda
of
don
ramon
de
yargas
in
the
neighbourhood
of
your
station
you
will
there
find
five
thousand
head
of
beeves
which
you
will
cause
to
be
driven
to
the
camp
of
the
american
army
and
delivered
to
the
you
will
find
the
necessary
drivers
upon
the
ground
and
a
portion
of
your
troop
will
form
the
escort
the
enclosed
will
enable
you
to
understand
the
nature
of
your
duty
captain
warfield
surely
thought
i
as
i
finished
reading
surely
there
is
a
that
shapes
our
ends
just
as
i
was
cudgelling
my
brains
for
some
scheme
of
introduction
to
don
ramon
de
vargas
here
comes
one
ready
fashioned
to
my
hand
i
thought
no
more
about
the
lazo
the
rope
was
no
longer
an
object
of
prime
interest
trimmed
and
embellished
with
the
graceful
excuse
of
duty
i
should
now
ride
boldly
up
to
the
hacienda
and
enter
its
gates
with
the
confident
air
of
a
welcome
guest
welcome
indeed
a
contract
for
five
thousand
beeves
and
at
a
good
stroke
of
business
on
the
part
of
the
old
don
of
course
i
shall
see
him
embrace
him
hobnob
with
him
over
a
glass
of
canario
or
xeres
get
upon
the
most
intimate
terms
and
so
be
asked
back
i
am
usually
popular
with
old
gentlemen
and
i
trusted
to
my
bright
star
to
place
me
with
don
ramon
de
vargas
the
coralling
of
the
cattle
would
occupy
some
time
a
brace
of
hours
at
the
least
that
would
be
outside
work
and
i
could
intrust
it
to
my
lieutenant
or
a
sergeant
for
myself
i
was
determined
to
stay
by
the
walls
the
don
must
go
out
to
look
after
his
vaqueros
it
would
be
rude
to
leave
me
alone
he
would
introduce
me
to
his
daughter
he
could
not
do
less
a
customer
on
so
large
a
scale
we
should
be
left
to
ourselves
and
then
ha
ijurra
i
had
forgotten
would
be
there
the
recollection
of
this
man
fell
like
a
shadow
over
the
bright
fancies
i
had
conjured
up
a
dispatch
from
calls
for
prompt
attention
and
my
reflections
were
cut
short
by
the
necessity
of
carrying
the
order
into
execution
without
loss
of
time
i
issued
the
command
for
about
fifty
of
the
rangers
to
boot
and
saddle
i
was
about
to
pay
more
than
ordinary
attention
to
my
toilet
when
it
occurred
to
me
i
might
as
well
first
peruse
the
note
referred
to
in
the
dispatch
i
opened
the
paper
to
my
surprise
the
document
was
in
spanish
this
did
not
puzzle
me
and
i
read
the
five
thousand
beeves
are
ready
for
you
according
to
the
contract
but
can
not
take
upon
me
to
deliver
them
must
be
taken
from
with
a
of
and
even
a
on
the
part
of
those
you
send
would
not
be
out
of
place
my
vaqueros
are
at
your
service
but
must
not
command
them
you
may
them
ramon
de
vargas
this
note
was
addressed
to
the
of
the
american
army
its
meaning
though
to
the
uninitiated
a
little
obscure
was
to
me
as
clear
as
noonday
and
although
it
gave
me
a
high
opinion
of
the
administrative
talents
of
don
ramon
de
vargas
it
was
by
no
means
a
welcome
document
it
rendered
null
every
act
of
the
fine
programme
i
had
sketched
out
by
its
directions
there
was
to
be
no
embracing
no
hobnobbing
over
wine
no
friendly
chat
with
the
don
no
with
his
beautiful
daughter
no
but
on
the
contrary
i
was
to
ride
up
with
a
swagger
bang
the
doors
threaten
the
trembling
porter
kick
the
peons
and
demand
from
their
master
five
thousand
head
of
all
in
true
freebooting
style
a
nice
figure
i
shall
cut
thought
i
in
the
eyes
of
isolina
a
little
reflection
however
convinced
me
that
that
intelligent
creature
would
be
in
the
secret
yes
she
will
understand
my
motives
i
can
act
with
as
much
mildness
as
circumstances
will
permit
my
texan
lieutenant
will
do
the
kicking
of
the
peons
and
that
without
much
pressing
if
she
be
not
cloistered
i
will
have
a
glimpse
at
her
so
here
goes
the
bugle
gave
the
signal
fifty
rangers
with
lieutenants
holingsworth
and
wheatley
leaped
into
their
saddles
and
next
moment
were
filing
by
twos
from
the
piazza
myself
at
their
head
a
twenty
minutes
trot
brought
us
to
the
front
gate
of
the
hacienda
where
we
halted
the
great
door
massive
and
was
closed
locked
and
barred
the
shutters
of
the
windows
as
well
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
outside
not
even
the
apparition
of
a
frightened
peon
i
had
given
my
texan
lieutenant
his
cue
he
knew
enough
of
spanish
for
the
purpose
flinging
himself
out
of
the
saddle
he
approached
the
gate
and
commenced
hammering
upon
it
with
the
butt
of
his
pistol
la
open
the
door
cried
he
no
answer
he
repeated
in
a
louder
tone
still
no
answer
la
once
more
vociferated
the
lieutenant
at
the
same
time
thundering
on
the
woodwork
with
his
weapon
when
the
noise
ceased
a
faint
who
is
it
was
heard
from
within
bawled
wheatley
answered
the
voice
in
a
somewhat
tremulous
key
anda
somos
hombres
de
quick
then
we
are
honest
men
a
rattling
of
chains
and
shooting
of
bolts
now
commenced
and
lasted
for
at
least
a
couple
of
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
great
opened
inward
displaying
to
view
the
swarthy
the
and
a
portion
of
the
or
courtyard
within
as
soon
as
the
door
was
fairly
open
wheatley
made
a
rush
at
the
trembling
porter
caught
him
by
the
jerkin
boxed
both
his
ears
and
then
commanded
him
in
a
loud
voice
to
summon
the
this
conduct
somewhat
unexpected
on
the
part
of
the
rangers
seemed
to
be
just
to
their
taste
and
i
could
hear
behind
me
the
whole
troop
chuckling
in
laughter
as
they
were
they
had
never
been
allowed
much
licence
in
their
dealings
with
the
inhabitants
the
of
the
country
and
much
less
had
they
witnessed
such
conduct
on
the
part
of
their
officers
indeed
it
was
cause
of
complaint
in
the
ranks
of
the
american
army
and
with
many
officers
too
that
even
hostile
mexicans
were
treated
with
a
lenient
consideration
denied
to
themselves
wheatley
behaviour
therefore
touched
a
chord
in
the
hearts
of
our
following
that
vibrated
pleasantly
enough
they
began
to
believe
that
the
campaign
was
about
to
become
a
little
more
jolly
stammered
the
porter
the
du
du
dueno
has
given
or
orders
he
wi
wi
will
not
any
one
not
echoed
wheatley
go
tell
him
he
yes
i
said
soothingly
for
i
began
to
fear
the
man
would
be
too
badly
frightened
to
deliver
his
message
go
say
to
your
master
that
an
american
officer
has
business
with
him
and
see
him
immediately
the
man
went
off
after
a
little
more
persuasion
from
the
free
hand
of
wheatley
of
course
leaving
the
gates
open
behind
him
we
did
not
wait
for
his
return
the
patio
looked
inviting
and
directing
holingsworth
to
remain
outside
with
the
men
and
the
texan
lieutenant
to
follow
me
i
headed
my
horse
for
the
great
archway
and
rode
in
chapter
eight
don
ramon
on
entering
the
courtyard
a
somewhat
novel
scene
presented
itself
a
spanish
picture
with
some
transatlantic
touches
the
of
a
mexican
house
is
its
proper
front
here
you
no
longer
look
upon
door
and
windows
but
facades
gaily
frescoed
curtained
verandahs
and
glazed
sashes
that
reach
to
the
ground
the
patio
of
don
ramon
mansion
was
paved
with
brick
a
fountain
with
its
tank
of
japanned
stood
in
the
centre
stretched
their
fronds
over
the
water
their
golden
globes
and
white
flowers
perfumed
the
atmosphere
which
cooled
by
the
constant
evaporation
of
the
felt
fresh
and
fragrant
around
three
sides
of
the
court
extended
a
verandah
its
floor
of
painted
tiles
rising
but
a
few
inches
above
the
level
of
the
pavement
a
row
of
supported
the
roof
of
this
verandah
and
the
whole
corridor
was
railed
in
and
curtained
the
curtains
were
and
except
at
one
point
the
entrance
between
two
of
the
portales
the
corridor
was
completely
screened
from
our
view
and
consequently
all
the
windows
of
the
house
that
opened
into
the
verandah
no
human
face
greeted
our
searching
glances
in
looking
to
the
rear
into
the
great
or
we
could
see
numerous
peons
in
their
brown
leathern
dresses
with
naked
legs
and
sandalled
feet
vaqueros
in
all
their
grandeur
of
velveteens
and
gold
or
silver
lace
with
a
number
of
women
and
young
girls
in
coloured
and
rebosos
a
busy
scene
was
presented
in
that
quarter
it
was
the
great
cattle
enclosure
for
the
estate
of
don
ramon
de
vargas
was
a
de
or
grand
a
title
which
in
no
way
detracts
from
the
presumed
respectability
of
its
owner
many
of
the
noble
hidalgoes
of
mexico
being
on
a
large
scale
on
entering
the
patio
i
only
glanced
back
at
the
corral
my
eyes
were
busy
with
the
curtained
verandah
and
failing
there
were
carried
up
to
the
azotea
in
hopes
of
discovering
the
object
of
my
thoughts
the
house
as
i
have
elsewhere
stated
was
but
a
single
story
in
height
and
from
the
saddle
i
could
almost
look
into
the
azotea
i
could
see
that
it
was
a
sanctuary
of
rare
plants
and
the
broad
leaves
and
bright
corollas
of
some
of
the
taller
ones
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
parapet
abundance
of
fair
flowers
i
could
perceive
but
not
that
one
for
which
i
was
looking
no
face
yet
showed
no
voice
greeted
us
with
a
welcome
the
shouts
of
the
vaqueros
the
music
of
caged
along
the
corridor
and
the
murmur
of
the
fountain
were
the
only
sounds
the
two
former
suddenly
became
hushed
as
the
hoofs
of
our
horses
rang
upon
the
stone
pavement
and
the
heedless
water
alone
continued
to
utter
its
soft
monotone
once
more
my
eyes
swept
the
curtain
gazing
intently
into
the
few
apertures
left
by
a
careless
drawing
once
more
they
sought
the
azotea
and
glanced
along
the
parapet
my
scrutiny
still
remained
unrewarded
without
exchanging
a
word
wheatley
and
i
sat
silent
in
our
saddles
awaiting
the
return
of
the
portero
already
the
peons
vaqueros
and
wenches
had
poured
in
through
the
back
gateway
and
stood
staring
with
astonishment
at
the
unexpected
guests
after
a
considerable
pause
the
tread
of
feet
was
heard
upon
the
corridor
and
presently
the
messenger
appeared
and
announced
that
the
was
coming
in
a
minute
after
one
of
the
curtains
was
drawn
back
and
an
old
gentleman
made
his
appearance
behind
the
railing
he
was
a
person
of
large
frame
and
although
slightly
stooping
with
age
his
step
was
firm
and
his
whole
aspect
bespoke
a
wonderful
energy
and
resolution
his
eyes
were
large
and
brilliant
shadowed
by
heavy
brows
upon
which
the
hair
still
retained
its
dark
colour
although
that
of
his
head
was
white
as
snow
he
was
simply
habited
in
a
jacket
of
nankeen
cloth
and
wide
trousers
of
like
material
he
wore
neither
waistcoat
nor
cravat
a
full
white
shirt
of
finest
linen
covered
his
breast
and
a
sash
of
dull
blue
colour
was
twisted
around
his
waist
on
his
head
was
a
costly
hat
of
the
guayaquil
grass
and
in
his
fingers
a
husk
cigarrito
smoking
at
the
end
altogether
the
aspect
of
don
ramon
for
it
was
he
despite
its
assumed
sternness
was
pleasing
and
intelligent
and
i
should
have
relished
a
friendly
chat
with
him
even
upon
his
own
account
this
however
was
out
of
the
question
i
must
abide
by
the
spirit
of
my
orders
the
farce
must
be
played
out
so
touching
the
flanks
of
my
horse
i
rode
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
verandah
and
placed
myself
with
the
don
are
you
don
ramon
de
vargas
si
senor
was
the
reply
in
a
tone
of
angry
astonishment
i
am
an
officer
of
the
american
army
i
spoke
loud
and
in
spanish
of
course
for
the
benefit
of
the
peons
and
vaqueros
i
am
sent
to
offer
you
a
contract
to
supply
the
army
with
beeves
i
have
here
an
order
from
the
i
have
no
beeves
for
sale
interrupted
don
ramon
in
a
loud
indignant
voice
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
american
army
then
sir
retorted
i
i
must
take
your
beeves
without
your
consent
you
shall
be
paid
for
them
but
take
them
i
must
my
orders
require
that
i
should
do
so
moreover
your
vaqueros
must
accompany
us
and
drive
the
cattle
to
the
american
camp
as
i
said
this
i
signalled
to
holingsworth
who
rode
in
with
his
following
and
then
the
whole
troop
filing
through
the
back
gateway
began
to
collect
the
frightened
vaqueros
and
set
them
about
their
work
i
protest
against
this
robbery
shouted
don
ramon
it
is
infamous
contrary
to
the
laws
of
civilised
warfare
i
shall
appeal
to
my
government
to
yours
i
shall
have
redress
you
shall
have
payment
don
ramon
said
i
apparently
trying
to
pacify
him
payment
payment
from
robbers
come
come
old
gentleman
cried
wheatley
who
was
only
half
behind
the
scenes
and
who
spoke
rather
in
earnest
keep
a
good
tongue
in
your
head
or
you
may
lose
something
of
more
value
to
you
than
your
cattle
remember
whom
you
are
talking
to
hissed
don
ramon
with
an
earnest
application
of
the
latter
phrase
that
would
certainly
have
brought
wheatley
revolver
from
his
belt
had
i
not
at
the
moment
whispered
a
word
in
the
lieutenant
ear
hang
the
old
rascal
muttered
he
in
reply
to
me
i
thought
he
in
earnest
look
here
old
fellow
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
don
ramon
do
you
be
scared
about
the
dollars
uncle
sam
a
liberal
trader
and
a
good
paymaster
i
wish
your
beef
was
mine
and
i
had
promise
to
pay
for
it
so
take
things
a
little
easier
if
you
please
and
do
be
so
free
of
your
and
texans
ai
used
to
such
talk
don
ramon
suddenly
cut
short
the
colloquy
by
angrily
closing
the
curtains
and
hiding
himself
from
our
sight
during
the
whole
scene
i
had
great
difficulty
in
controlling
my
countenance
i
could
perceive
that
the
mexican
laboured
under
a
similar
difficulty
there
was
a
laughing
devil
in
the
corner
of
his
keen
eye
that
required
restraint
and
i
thought
once
or
twice
either
he
or
i
should
lose
our
equanimity
certainly
should
have
done
so
but
that
my
heart
and
eyes
were
most
of
the
time
in
other
quarters
as
for
the
don
he
was
playing
an
important
part
and
a
suspicion
of
his
hypocrisy
on
the
minds
of
some
of
the
who
listened
to
the
dialogue
might
have
afterwards
brought
him
to
grief
most
of
them
were
his
own
domestics
and
retainers
but
not
all
there
were
free
among
them
some
who
belonged
to
the
pueblita
itself
some
perchance
who
had
figured
in
who
voted
at
elections
and
styled
themselves
the
don
therefore
had
good
reasons
for
assuming
a
character
and
well
did
the
old
gentleman
sustain
it
as
he
drew
the
curtain
his
adios
capitan
heard
only
by
myself
sounded
full
of
sweetness
and
and
i
felt
rather
contented
as
i
straightened
myself
in
the
saddle
and
issued
the
order
for
his
cattle
chapter
nine
un
papelcito
wheatley
now
rode
after
the
troop
with
which
holingworth
had
already
entered
the
corral
a
band
of
drivers
was
speedily
pressed
into
service
and
with
these
the
two
lieutenants
proceeded
to
the
great
plain
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
where
most
of
don
ramon
cattle
were
at
pasture
by
this
arrangement
i
was
left
alone
if
i
except
the
company
of
slippered
wenches
the
deities
of
the
who
clustered
in
the
corner
of
the
patio
eyed
me
with
mingled
looks
of
curiosity
and
fear
the
verandah
curtains
remained
hermetically
closed
and
though
i
glanced
at
every
aperture
that
offered
a
chance
to
an
observing
eye
no
one
appeared
to
be
stirring
behind
them
too
perhaps
indifferent
thought
i
the
latter
supposition
was
by
no
means
gratifying
to
my
vanity
after
all
now
that
the
others
are
gone
out
of
the
way
don
ramon
ask
me
to
step
inside
ah
no
these
mestizo
women
would
tell
tales
i
perceive
it
would
never
do
i
may
as
well
give
it
up
i
shall
ride
out
and
join
the
troop
as
i
turned
my
horse
to
put
this
design
into
execution
the
fountain
came
under
my
eyes
its
water
reminded
me
that
i
was
thirsty
for
it
was
a
july
day
and
a
hot
one
a
gourd
cup
lay
on
the
edge
of
the
tank
without
dismounting
i
was
able
to
lay
hold
of
the
vessel
and
filling
it
with
the
cool
sparkling
liquid
i
drained
it
off
it
was
very
good
water
but
not
canario
or
xeres
sweeping
the
curtain
once
more
i
turned
with
a
disappointed
glance
and
jagging
my
horse
rode
doggedly
out
through
the
back
gateway
once
in
the
rear
of
the
buildings
i
had
a
full
view
of
the
great
meadow
already
known
to
me
and
pulling
up
i
sat
in
the
saddle
and
watched
the
animated
scene
that
was
there
being
enacted
bulls
half
wild
rushing
to
and
fro
in
mad
fury
vaqueros
mounted
on
their
light
mustangs
with
streaming
sash
and
winding
lazo
rangers
upon
their
heavier
steeds
offering
but
a
clumsy
aid
to
the
more
adroit
and
practised
herdsmen
others
driving
off
large
groups
that
had
been
already
collected
and
brought
into
subjection
and
all
this
amidst
the
fierce
bellowing
of
the
bulls
the
shouts
and
laughter
of
the
delighted
troopers
the
shriller
cries
of
the
vaqueros
and
peons
the
whole
forming
a
picture
that
under
other
circumstances
i
should
have
contemplated
with
interest
just
then
my
spirits
were
not
attuned
to
its
enjoyment
and
although
i
remained
for
some
minutes
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
plain
my
thoughts
were
wandering
elsewhere
i
confess
to
a
strong
faith
in
woman
curiosity
that
such
a
scene
could
be
passing
under
the
windows
of
the
most
aristocratic
mansion
without
its
most
aristocratic
inmate
deigning
to
take
a
peep
at
it
i
could
not
believe
besides
isolina
was
the
very
reverse
ha
despite
that
jealous
curtain
those
beautiful
eyes
are
glancing
through
some
aperture
window
or
loophole
i
doubt
not
and
with
this
reflection
i
once
more
turned
my
face
to
the
buildings
just
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
not
sufficiently
reconnoitred
the
of
the
dwelling
as
we
approached
it
we
had
observed
that
the
shutters
of
the
windows
were
closed
but
these
opened
inward
and
since
that
time
one
or
other
of
them
might
have
been
set
a
little
ajar
from
my
knowledge
of
mexican
interiors
i
knew
that
the
front
windows
are
those
of
the
principal
apartments
of
the
and
grand
or
precisely
those
where
the
inmates
of
that
hour
should
be
found
fool
thought
i
to
have
remained
so
long
in
the
patio
had
i
gone
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
i
might
have
is
not
too
late
there
a
chance
yet
under
the
impulse
of
this
new
hope
i
rode
back
through
the
corral
and
the
patio
the
mestizas
were
still
there
chattering
and
flurried
as
ever
and
the
curtain
had
not
been
stirred
a
glance
at
it
was
all
i
gave
and
without
stopping
i
walked
my
horse
across
the
paved
court
and
entered
under
the
arched
the
massive
gate
stood
open
as
we
had
left
it
and
on
looking
into
the
little
box
of
the
portero
i
perceived
that
it
was
empty
the
man
had
hid
himself
in
dread
of
a
second
interview
with
the
texan
lieutenant
in
another
moment
i
had
emerged
from
the
gateway
and
was
about
turning
my
horse
to
inspect
the
windows
when
i
heard
the
word
capitan
pronounced
in
a
voice
that
sounded
soft
as
a
silver
bell
and
thrilled
to
my
heart
like
a
strain
of
music
i
looked
towards
the
windows
it
came
not
thence
they
were
close
shut
as
ever
whence
before
i
had
time
to
ask
myself
the
question
the
capitan
was
repeated
in
a
somewhat
louder
key
and
i
now
perceived
that
the
voice
proceeded
from
above
from
the
azotea
i
wrenched
my
horse
round
at
the
same
time
turning
my
eyes
upward
i
could
see
no
one
but
just
at
that
moment
an
arm
that
might
have
been
attached
to
the
bust
of
venus
was
protruded
through
a
notch
in
the
parapet
in
the
small
hand
wickedly
sparkling
with
jewels
was
something
white
which
i
could
not
distinguish
until
i
saw
it
projected
on
the
grass
at
the
same
moment
that
the
phrase
un
papelcito
reached
my
ears
without
hesitation
i
dismounted
made
myself
master
of
the
and
then
leaping
once
more
into
the
saddle
looked
upward
i
had
purposely
drawn
my
horse
some
distance
from
the
walls
so
that
i
might
command
a
better
view
i
was
not
disappointed
isolina
the
face
that
lovely
face
was
just
distinguishable
through
the
slender
embrasure
the
large
brown
eyes
gazing
upon
me
with
that
glance
i
had
already
noticed
and
which
produced
within
me
both
pleasure
and
pain
i
was
about
to
speak
to
her
when
i
saw
the
expression
suddenly
change
a
hurried
glance
was
thrown
backwards
as
if
the
approach
of
some
one
disturbed
her
a
finger
rested
momentarily
on
her
lips
and
then
her
face
disappeared
behind
the
screening
wall
of
the
parapet
i
understood
the
universal
sign
and
remained
silent
for
some
moments
i
was
undecided
whether
to
go
or
stay
she
had
evidently
withdrawn
from
the
front
of
the
building
though
she
was
still
upon
the
azotea
some
one
had
joined
her
and
i
could
hear
voices
in
conversation
her
own
contrasting
with
the
harsher
tones
of
a
man
perhaps
her
father
perhaps
that
other
less
agreeable
supposition
i
was
about
to
ride
off
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
better
first
master
the
contents
of
the
papelcito
perhaps
it
might
throw
some
light
on
the
situation
and
enable
me
to
adopt
the
more
pleasant
alternative
of
remaining
a
while
longer
upon
the
premises
i
had
thrust
the
into
the
breast
of
my
frock
and
now
looked
around
for
some
place
where
i
might
draw
it
forth
and
peruse
it
unobserved
the
great
arched
gateway
shadowy
and
tenantless
offered
the
desired
accommodation
and
heading
my
horse
to
it
i
once
more
rode
inside
the
saguan
facing
around
so
as
to
hide
my
front
from
the
i
drew
forth
the
strip
of
folded
paper
and
spread
it
open
before
me
though
written
in
pencil
and
evidently
in
a
hurried
impromptu
i
had
no
difficulty
in
deciphering
it
my
heart
throbbed
exultingly
as
i
read
capitan
i
know
you
will
pardon
our
dry
hospitality
a
cup
of
cold
water
ha
ha
ha
remember
what
i
told
you
yesterday
we
fear
our
more
than
our
and
we
have
a
in
the
house
my
father
dreads
more
than
you
and
your
terrible
i
am
not
angry
with
you
for
my
pet
but
you
have
carried
off
my
lazo
as
well
ah
capitan
would
you
rob
me
of
adios
isolina
thrusting
the
paper
back
into
my
bosom
i
sat
for
some
time
pondering
upon
its
contents
part
was
clear
enough
the
remaining
part
full
of
mystery
we
fear
our
more
than
i
was
behind
the
scenes
sufficiently
to
comprehend
what
was
intended
by
that
cunningly
worded
phrase
it
simply
meant
that
don
ramon
de
vargas
was
in
other
words
a
friend
to
the
american
cause
or
as
some
loud
demagogues
would
have
pronounced
him
a
traitor
to
his
country
it
did
not
follow
however
that
he
was
anything
of
the
kind
he
might
have
wished
success
to
the
american
arms
and
still
remained
a
true
friend
to
his
country
not
one
of
those
blind
bigots
whose
standard
displays
the
brigand
motto
our
country
right
or
wrong
but
an
enlightened
patriot
who
desired
more
to
see
mexico
enjoy
peace
and
happiness
under
foreign
domination
than
that
it
should
continue
in
anarchy
under
the
iron
rule
of
native
despots
what
is
there
in
the
empty
title
of
without
peace
without
liberty
after
all
patriotism
in
its
ordinary
sense
is
but
a
doubtful
virtue
perhaps
nearer
to
a
crime
it
will
one
day
appear
so
one
day
in
the
far
future
it
will
be
supplanted
by
a
virtue
of
higher
order
the
patriotism
that
knows
no
boundaries
of
nations
but
whose
is
the
whole
earth
that
however
would
be
patriotism
was
don
ramon
de
vargas
a
patriot
in
this
sense
a
man
of
progress
who
cared
not
that
the
of
mexico
should
be
blotted
from
the
map
so
long
as
peace
and
prosperity
should
be
given
to
his
country
under
another
name
was
don
ramon
one
of
these
it
might
be
there
were
many
such
in
mexico
at
that
time
and
these
principally
of
the
class
to
which
senor
de
vargas
belonged
the
or
proprietors
it
is
easy
enough
to
explain
why
the
ayankieados
were
of
the
class
of
ricos
perhaps
the
affection
of
don
ramon
for
the
american
cause
had
less
lofty
motives
perhaps
the
five
thousand
beeves
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
whether
or
no
i
could
not
tell
nor
did
i
stay
to
consider
i
only
reflected
upon
the
matter
at
all
as
offering
an
explanation
to
the
ambiguous
phrase
now
twice
used
by
his
fair
daughter
we
fear
our
more
than
our
on
either
supposition
the
meaning
was
clear
what
followed
was
far
from
being
equally
perspicuous
guest
in
the
house
dreaded
by
her
here
was
mystery
indeed
who
could
that
guest
be
who
but
but
ijurra
was
her
cousin
she
had
said
so
if
a
cousin
why
should
he
be
dreaded
was
there
still
another
guest
in
the
house
that
might
be
i
had
not
been
inside
to
see
the
mansion
was
large
enough
to
accommodate
another
half
a
score
of
others
for
all
that
my
thoughts
constantly
turned
upon
ijurra
why
i
know
not
but
i
could
not
resist
the
belief
that
he
was
the
person
pointed
at
the
guest
that
was
dreaded
the
behaviour
which
i
had
noticed
on
the
day
before
the
first
and
only
time
i
had
ever
seen
the
man
his
angry
speech
and
looks
addressed
to
isolina
her
apparent
fear
of
him
these
it
was
no
doubt
that
guided
my
instincts
and
i
at
length
came
to
the
conviction
that
he
was
the
fiend
dreaded
by
don
ramon
and
she
too
feared
him
god
grant
she
do
not
also
him
such
was
my
mental
ejaculation
as
i
passed
on
to
consider
the
closing
sentences
of
the
hastily
written
note
in
these
i
also
encountered
ambiguity
of
expression
whether
i
construed
it
aright
time
would
tell
perhaps
my
wish
was
too
much
parent
to
my
thoughts
but
it
was
with
an
exulting
heart
i
read
the
closing
sentence
and
rode
forth
from
the
gateway
chapter
ten
an
old
enmity
i
rode
slowly
and
but
a
few
paces
before
reining
up
my
horse
although
i
was
under
the
impression
that
it
would
be
useless
remaining
and
that
an
interview
with
isolina
was
impossible
for
that
day
at
least
i
could
not
divest
myself
of
the
desire
to
linger
a
little
longer
near
the
spot
perhaps
she
might
appear
again
upon
the
azotea
if
but
for
a
moment
if
but
to
wave
her
hand
and
waft
me
an
adieu
if
but
when
a
short
distance
separated
me
from
the
walls
i
drew
up
and
turning
in
the
saddle
glanced
back
to
the
parapet
a
face
was
there
where
hers
had
been
but
oh
the
contrast
between
her
lovely
features
and
those
that
now
met
my
gaze
hyperion
to
the
satyr
not
that
the
face
now
before
me
was
ugly
or
there
are
some
and
women
too
who
would
have
termed
it
handsome
to
my
eyes
it
was
hideous
let
me
confess
that
this
hideousness
or
more
properly
its
cause
rested
in
the
moral
rather
than
the
physical
expression
perhaps
too
little
of
it
might
have
been
found
in
my
own
heart
under
other
circumstances
i
might
not
have
criticised
that
face
so
harshly
all
the
world
did
not
agree
with
me
about
the
face
of
rafael
ijurra
for
it
was
he
who
was
gazing
over
the
parapet
our
eyes
met
and
that
first
glance
stamped
the
relationship
between
us
hostility
for
life
not
a
word
passed
and
yet
the
looks
of
each
told
the
other
in
the
plainest
language
am
your
had
we
sworn
it
in
wild
oaths
in
all
the
bitter
hyperbole
of
insult
neither
of
us
would
have
felt
it
more
profound
and
keen
i
shall
not
stay
to
analyse
this
feeling
of
sudden
and
unexpressed
hostility
though
the
philosophy
of
it
is
simple
enough
you
too
have
experienced
it
perhaps
more
than
once
in
your
life
without
being
exactly
able
to
explain
it
i
am
not
in
that
dilemma
i
could
explain
it
easily
enough
but
it
scarcely
merits
an
explanation
suffice
to
say
that
while
gazing
upon
the
face
of
that
man
i
entertained
it
in
all
its
strength
i
have
called
it
an
hostility
therein
i
have
spoken
without
thought
it
was
fully
expressed
by
both
of
us
though
not
in
words
words
are
but
weak
symbols
of
a
passion
compared
with
the
passion
itself
exhibited
in
the
clenched
hand
the
lip
compressed
the
flashing
eye
the
clouded
cheek
the
quick
play
of
the
muscles
weak
symbols
are
words
compared
with
signs
like
these
no
words
passed
between
ijurra
and
myself
none
were
needed
each
read
in
the
other
a
rival
a
rival
in
love
a
competitor
for
the
heart
of
a
lovely
woman
the
in
mexico
it
is
needless
to
say
that
under
such
an
aspect
each
hated
the
other
at
sight
in
the
face
of
ijurra
i
read
more
i
saw
before
me
a
man
of
bad
heart
and
brutal
nature
his
large
and
to
speak
the
truth
beautiful
eyes
had
in
them
an
animal
expression
they
were
not
without
intelligence
but
so
much
the
worse
for
that
intelligence
expressed
ferocity
and
bad
faith
his
beauty
was
the
beauty
of
the
jaguar
he
had
the
air
of
an
accomplished
man
accustomed
to
conquest
in
the
field
of
love
heartless
reckless
false
o
mystery
of
our
nature
there
are
those
who
love
such
men
in
ijurra
face
i
read
more
knew
my
the
significant
glance
of
his
eye
told
me
so
he
knew
why
i
was
lingering
there
the
satiric
smile
upon
his
lip
attested
it
he
saw
my
efforts
to
obtain
an
interview
and
confident
in
his
own
position
held
my
failure
but
lightly
a
something
only
to
amuse
him
i
could
tell
all
this
by
the
sardonic
sneer
that
sat
upon
his
features
as
we
continued
to
gaze
neither
moving
his
eyes
from
the
other
this
sneer
became
too
oppressive
to
be
silently
borne
i
could
no
longer
stand
such
a
satirical
reading
of
my
thoughts
the
insult
was
as
marked
as
words
could
have
made
it
and
i
was
about
to
have
recourse
to
words
to
reply
when
the
clatter
of
a
horse
hoofs
caused
me
to
turn
my
eyes
in
an
opposite
direction
a
horseman
was
coming
up
the
hill
in
a
direct
line
from
the
pastures
i
saw
it
was
one
of
the
lieutenants
holingsworth
a
few
more
stretches
of
his
horse
brought
the
lieutenant
upon
the
ground
where
he
pulled
up
directly
in
front
of
me
captain
warfield
said
he
speaking
in
an
official
tone
the
cattle
are
collected
shall
we
proceed
he
proceeded
no
further
with
that
sentence
his
eye
chance
directed
was
carried
up
to
the
azotea
and
rested
upon
the
face
of
ijurra
he
started
in
his
saddle
as
if
a
serpent
had
stung
him
his
hollow
eyes
shot
prominently
out
glaring
wildly
from
their
sockets
while
the
muscles
of
his
throat
and
jaws
twitched
in
convulsive
action
for
a
moment
the
desperate
passion
seemed
to
stifle
his
breathing
and
while
thus
silent
the
expression
of
his
eyes
puzzled
me
it
was
of
frantic
joy
and
ill
became
that
face
where
i
had
never
observed
a
smile
but
the
strange
look
was
soon
explained
it
was
not
of
friendship
but
the
joy
of
anticipated
vengeance
breaking
into
a
wild
laugh
he
shrieked
out
rafael
ijurra
by
the
eternal
god
this
awful
and
emphatic
recognition
produced
its
effect
i
saw
that
ijurra
knew
the
man
who
addressed
him
his
dark
countenance
turned
suddenly
pale
and
then
became
mottled
with
livid
spots
while
his
eyes
scintillated
and
rolled
about
in
the
unsteady
glances
of
terror
he
made
no
reply
beyond
the
ejaculation
demonio
which
seemed
involuntarily
to
escape
him
he
appeared
unable
to
reply
surprise
and
fright
held
him
and
speechless
traitor
villain
murderer
shrieked
holingsworth
we
met
at
last
now
for
a
squaring
of
our
accounts
and
in
the
next
instant
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
was
pointing
to
the
notch
in
the
parapet
pointing
to
the
face
of
ijurra
hold
holingsworth
hold
cried
i
pressing
my
heel
deeply
into
my
horse
flanks
and
dashing
forward
though
my
steed
sprang
instantly
to
the
spur
and
as
quickly
i
caught
the
lieutenant
arm
i
was
too
late
to
arrest
the
shot
i
spoiled
his
aim
however
and
the
bullet
instead
of
passing
through
the
brain
of
rafael
ijurra
as
it
would
certainly
have
done
glanced
upon
the
mortar
of
the
parapet
sending
a
cloud
of
into
his
face
up
to
that
moment
the
mexican
had
made
no
attempt
to
escape
beyond
the
aim
of
his
antagonist
terror
must
have
glued
him
to
the
spot
it
was
only
when
the
report
of
the
rifle
and
the
blinding
mortar
broke
the
spell
that
he
was
able
to
turn
and
fly
when
the
dust
cleared
away
his
head
was
no
longer
above
the
wall
i
turned
to
my
companion
and
addressed
him
in
some
warmth
lieutenant
holingsworth
i
command
captain
warfield
interrupted
he
in
a
tone
of
cool
determination
you
may
command
me
in
all
matters
of
duty
and
i
shall
obey
you
this
is
a
private
affair
and
by
the
eternal
the
general
himself
bah
i
lose
time
the
villain
will
escape
and
before
i
could
seize
either
himself
or
his
holingsworth
had
shot
his
horse
past
me
and
entered
the
gateway
at
a
gallop
i
followed
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
reached
the
patio
almost
as
soon
as
he
but
too
late
to
hinder
him
from
his
purpose
i
grasped
him
by
the
arm
but
with
determined
strength
he
wrenched
himself
free
at
the
same
instant
gliding
out
of
the
saddle
pistol
in
hand
he
rushed
up
the
his
trailing
scabbard
clanking
upon
the
stone
steps
as
he
went
he
was
soon
out
of
my
sight
behind
the
parapet
of
the
azotea
flinging
myself
from
the
saddle
i
followed
as
fast
as
my
legs
would
carry
me
while
on
the
stairway
i
heard
loud
words
and
oaths
above
the
crash
of
falling
objects
and
then
two
shots
following
quick
and
fast
upon
each
other
i
heard
screaming
in
a
woman
voice
and
then
a
groan
the
last
uttered
by
a
man
one
of
them
is
dead
or
dying
thought
i
on
reaching
the
azotea
which
i
did
in
a
few
seconds
of
time
i
found
perfect
silence
there
i
saw
no
one
male
or
female
living
or
dead
true
the
place
was
like
a
garden
with
plants
shrubs
and
even
trees
growing
in
gigantic
pots
i
could
not
view
it
all
at
once
they
might
still
be
there
behind
the
screen
of
leaves
i
ran
to
and
fro
over
the
whole
roof
i
saw
freshly
broken
it
was
the
crash
of
them
i
had
heard
while
coming
up
i
saw
no
man
neither
holingsworth
nor
ijurra
they
could
not
be
standing
up
or
i
should
have
seen
them
perhaps
they
are
down
among
the
pots
both
there
were
two
shots
perhaps
both
are
down
dead
but
where
was
she
who
screamed
was
it
isolina
half
distracted
i
rushed
to
another
part
of
the
roof
i
saw
a
small
escalera
a
private
stair
that
led
into
the
interior
of
the
house
ha
they
must
have
gone
down
by
it
she
who
screamed
must
have
gone
that
way
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
to
follow
but
it
was
no
time
to
stand
upon
etiquette
and
i
was
preparing
to
plunge
down
the
stairway
when
i
heard
shouting
outside
the
walls
and
then
another
shot
from
a
pistol
i
turned
and
stepped
hastily
across
the
azotea
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
i
looked
over
the
parapet
down
the
slope
of
the
hill
two
men
were
running
at
the
top
of
their
speed
one
after
the
other
the
hindmost
held
in
his
hand
a
drawn
sabre
it
was
holingsworth
still
in
pursuit
of
ijurra
the
latter
appeared
to
be
gaining
upon
his
vengeful
pursuer
who
burdened
with
his
accoutrements
ran
heavily
the
mexican
was
evidently
making
for
the
woods
that
grew
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
in
a
few
seconds
more
he
had
entered
the
timber
and
passed
out
of
sight
like
a
hound
upon
the
trail
holingsworth
followed
and
disappeared
from
my
view
at
the
same
spot
hoping
i
might
still
be
able
to
prevent
the
shedding
of
blood
i
descended
hastily
from
the
azotea
mounted
my
horse
and
galloped
down
the
hill
i
reached
the
edge
of
the
woods
where
the
two
had
gone
in
and
followed
some
distance
upon
their
trail
but
i
lost
it
at
length
and
came
to
a
halt
i
remained
for
some
minutes
listening
for
voices
or
what
i
more
expected
to
hear
the
report
of
a
pistol
neither
sound
reached
me
i
heard
only
the
shouts
of
the
vaqueros
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
and
this
reminding
me
of
my
duty
i
turned
my
horse
and
rode
back
to
the
hacienda
there
everything
was
silent
not
a
face
was
to
be
seen
the
inmates
of
the
house
had
hidden
themselves
in
rooms
barred
up
and
dark
even
the
damsels
of
the
kitchen
had
disappeared
thinking
no
doubt
that
an
attack
would
be
made
upon
the
premises
and
that
spoliation
and
plunder
were
intended
i
was
puzzled
how
to
act
holingsworth
strange
conduct
had
disarranged
my
ideas
i
should
have
demanded
admission
and
explained
the
occurrence
to
don
ramon
but
i
had
no
explanation
to
give
i
rather
needed
one
for
myself
and
under
a
painful
feeling
of
suspense
as
to
the
result
i
rode
off
from
the
place
rangers
were
left
upon
the
ground
with
orders
to
await
the
return
of
holingsworth
and
then
gallop
after
us
while
the
remainder
of
the
troop
with
wheatley
and
myself
in
advance
of
the
vast
drove
took
the
route
for
the
american
camp
chapter
eleven
rafael
ijurra
in
i
journeyed
along
the
hot
sun
and
the
dusty
road
did
not
improve
my
temper
ruffled
as
it
was
by
the
unpleasant
incident
i
was
far
from
satisfied
with
my
first
lieutenant
whose
conduct
was
still
a
mystery
wheatley
could
not
explain
it
some
old
enmity
no
doubt
both
of
us
believed
some
story
of
wrong
and
revenge
no
everyday
man
was
holingsworth
but
one
altogether
of
peculiar
character
and
temperament
as
unlike
him
who
rode
by
my
side
as
acid
to
alkali
the
latter
was
a
dashing
cheerful
fellow
dressed
in
costume
who
could
ride
a
wild
horse
and
throw
the
lazo
with
any
vaquero
in
the
crowd
he
was
a
true
texan
almost
by
birth
had
shared
the
fortunes
of
the
young
republic
since
the
days
of
austin
and
was
never
more
happy
than
while
engaged
in
the
border
warfare
that
with
slight
intervals
had
been
carried
on
against
either
mexican
or
indian
foeman
ever
since
the
had
spread
its
banner
to
the
breeze
no
raw
recruit
was
wheatley
though
young
he
was
what
texans
term
an
old
indian
fighter
a
real
texas
ranker
holingsworth
was
not
a
texan
but
a
tennessean
though
texas
had
been
for
some
years
his
adopted
home
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
crossed
the
rio
grande
he
had
been
one
of
the
unfortunate
mier
expedition
a
survivor
of
that
decimated
band
afterwards
carried
in
chains
to
mexico
and
there
compelled
to
work
in
the
mud
of
the
great
that
traverse
the
streets
such
experience
might
account
for
the
serious
somewhat
stern
expression
that
habitually
rested
upon
his
countenance
and
gave
him
the
character
of
a
dark
saturnine
man
i
have
said
incidentally
that
i
never
saw
him
smile
never
he
spoke
seldom
and
as
a
general
thing
only
upon
matters
of
duty
but
at
times
when
he
fancied
himself
alone
i
have
heard
him
mutter
threats
while
a
convulsive
twitching
of
the
muscles
and
a
mechanical
clenching
of
the
fingers
accompanied
his
words
as
though
he
stood
in
the
presence
of
some
deadly
foe
i
had
more
than
once
observed
these
frenzied
outbursts
without
knowing
aught
of
their
cause
harding
holingsworth
such
was
his
full
name
was
a
man
with
whom
no
one
would
have
cared
to
take
the
liberty
of
asking
an
explanation
of
his
conduct
his
courage
and
were
well
known
among
the
texans
but
it
is
idle
to
add
this
since
otherwise
he
could
not
have
stood
among
them
in
the
capacity
of
a
leader
men
like
them
who
have
the
election
of
their
own
officers
do
not
trust
their
lives
to
the
guidance
of
either
stripling
or
coward
wheatley
and
i
were
talking
the
matter
over
as
we
rode
along
and
endeavouring
to
account
for
the
strange
behaviour
of
holingsworth
we
had
both
concluded
that
the
affair
had
arisen
from
some
old
enmity
perhaps
connected
with
the
mier
expedition
when
accidentally
i
mentioned
the
mexican
name
up
to
this
moment
the
texan
lieutenant
had
not
seen
ijurra
having
been
busy
with
the
cattle
upon
the
other
side
of
the
hill
nor
had
the
name
been
pronounced
in
his
hearing
ijurra
he
exclaimed
with
a
start
reining
up
and
turning
upon
me
an
inquiring
look
ijurra
ijurra
do
you
think
yes
rafael
that
is
the
name
a
tall
dark
fellow
moustached
and
whiskered
not
yes
he
might
answer
that
description
i
replied
if
it
be
the
same
rafael
ijurra
that
used
to
live
at
san
antonio
there
more
than
one
texan
would
like
to
raise
hair
the
same
it
must
be
there
no
two
of
the
name
likely
no
what
do
you
know
of
him
know
that
he
about
the
most
precious
scoundrel
in
all
texas
or
mexico
either
and
that
saying
a
good
deal
rafael
ijurra
is
he
by
thunder
it
be
nobody
else
and
holingsworth
ha
now
i
think
of
it
it
just
the
man
and
harding
holingsworth
of
all
men
living
has
good
reasons
to
remember
how
explain
the
texan
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
to
collect
his
scattered
memories
and
then
proceeded
to
detail
what
he
knew
of
rafael
ijurra
his
account
without
the
expletives
and
emphatic
ejaculations
which
adorned
it
was
substantially
as
follows
rafael
ijurra
was
by
birth
a
texan
of
mexican
race
he
had
formerly
possessed
a
hacienda
near
san
antonio
de
bexar
with
other
considerable
property
all
of
which
he
had
spent
at
play
or
otherwise
dissipated
so
that
he
had
sunk
to
the
status
of
a
professional
gambler
up
to
the
date
of
the
mier
expedition
he
had
passed
off
as
a
citizen
of
texas
under
the
new
regime
and
pretended
much
patriotic
attachment
to
the
young
republic
when
the
mier
adventure
was
about
being
organised
ijurra
had
influence
enough
to
have
himself
elected
one
of
its
officers
no
one
suspected
his
fidelity
to
the
cause
he
was
one
of
those
who
at
the
halt
by
laredo
urged
the
imprudent
advance
upon
mier
and
his
presumed
knowledge
of
the
country
of
which
he
was
a
native
gave
weight
to
his
counsel
it
afterwards
proved
that
his
free
advice
was
intended
for
the
benefit
of
the
enemy
with
whom
he
was
in
secret
correspondence
on
the
night
before
the
battle
ijurra
was
missing
the
texan
army
was
captured
after
a
brave
defence
in
which
they
slew
more
than
their
own
number
of
the
enemy
and
under
guard
the
remnant
was
marched
off
for
the
capital
of
mexico
on
the
second
or
third
day
of
their
march
what
was
the
astonishment
of
the
texan
prisoners
to
see
rafael
ijurra
the
uniform
of
a
mexican
officer
and
forming
part
of
their
but
that
their
hands
were
bound
they
would
have
torn
him
to
pieces
so
enraged
were
they
at
this
piece
of
black
treason
i
was
not
in
that
ugly
scrape
continued
the
lieutenant
as
luck
would
have
it
i
was
down
with
a
fever
in
brazos
bottom
or
i
guess
i
should
have
had
to
my
with
the
rest
of
poor
fellows
wheatley
allusion
to
drawing
his
bean
i
understood
well
enough
all
who
have
ever
read
the
account
of
this
adventure
will
remember
that
the
texans
goaded
by
rose
upon
their
guard
disarmed
and
conquered
them
but
in
their
subsequent
attempt
to
escape
ill
managed
and
ill
guided
nearly
all
of
them
were
recaptured
and
each
tenth
man
having
been
shot
like
a
dog
the
mode
of
choosing
the
victims
was
by
lot
and
the
black
and
white
beans
of
mexico
were
made
use
of
as
the
expositors
of
the
fatal
decrees
of
destiny
a
number
of
the
beans
corresponding
to
the
number
of
the
captives
was
placed
within
an
earthen
there
being
a
black
bean
for
every
nine
white
ones
he
who
drew
the
black
bean
must
die
during
the
drawing
of
this
fearful
lottery
there
occurred
incidents
exhibiting
character
as
heroic
as
has
ever
been
recorded
in
story
read
from
an
they
all
drew
their
beans
with
manly
dignity
and
firmness
some
of
lighter
temper
jested
over
the
bloody
tragedy
one
would
say
this
beats
raffling
all
to
another
this
is
the
tallest
i
ever
was
robert
beard
who
lay
upon
the
ground
exceedingly
ill
called
his
brother
william
and
said
if
you
draw
a
black
bean
i
take
your
place
i
want
to
die
the
brother
with
overwhelming
anguish
replied
i
will
keep
my
own
place
am
stronger
and
better
able
to
die
than
major
cocke
when
he
drew
the
fatal
bean
held
it
up
between
his
finger
and
thumb
and
with
a
smile
of
contempt
said
i
told
you
so
i
never
failed
in
my
life
to
draw
a
prize
he
then
coolly
added
only
rob
me
of
forty
years
henry
whaling
one
of
cameron
best
fighters
as
he
drew
his
black
bean
said
in
a
joyous
tone
they
make
much
out
of
me
anyhow
i
know
i
killed
of
them
then
demanding
his
dinner
in
a
firm
voice
he
added
shall
not
cheat
me
out
of
it
saying
this
he
ate
heartily
smoked
a
cigar
and
in
twenty
minutes
after
had
ceased
to
live
the
mexicans
fired
fifteen
shots
at
whaling
before
he
expired
young
torrey
quite
a
youth
but
in
spirit
a
giant
said
that
he
perfectly
willing
to
meet
his
fate
for
the
glory
of
his
country
he
had
fought
and
for
her
glory
he
was
willing
to
die
edward
este
spoke
of
his
death
with
the
coolest
indifference
cash
said
they
murdered
my
brother
with
colonel
fannin
and
they
are
about
to
murder
me
jones
said
to
the
interpreter
the
officer
to
look
upon
men
who
are
not
afraid
to
die
for
their
country
captain
eastland
behaved
with
the
most
patriotic
dignity
he
desired
that
his
country
should
not
particularly
avenge
his
death
major
dunham
said
he
was
prepared
to
die
for
his
country
james
ogden
with
his
usual
equanimity
of
temper
smiled
at
his
fate
and
said
am
prepared
to
meet
it
young
robert
harris
behaved
in
the
most
unflinching
manner
and
called
upon
his
companions
to
avenge
their
murder
they
were
bound
together
their
eyes
being
bandaged
and
set
upon
a
log
near
the
wall
with
their
backs
towards
their
executioners
they
all
begged
the
officer
to
shoot
them
in
front
and
at
a
short
distance
saying
they
not
afraid
to
look
death
in
the
this
request
the
mexican
refused
and
to
make
his
cruelty
as
refined
as
possible
caused
the
fire
to
be
delivered
from
a
distance
and
to
be
continued
for
ten
or
twelve
minutes
lacerating
and
mangling
those
heroes
in
a
manner
too
horrible
for
description
when
you
talk
of
thermopylae
think
also
of
texas
but
what
of
holingsworth
i
asked
ah
holingsworth
replied
the
lieutenant
good
cause
to
remember
ijurra
now
i
think
of
it
i
shall
give
the
story
to
you
as
i
heard
it
and
my
companion
proceeded
with
a
relation
which
caused
the
blood
to
curdle
in
my
veins
as
i
listened
it
fully
explained
if
it
did
not
palliate
the
fierce
hatred
of
the
tennessean
towards
rafael
ijurra
in
the
mier
expedition
holingsworth
had
a
brother
who
like
himself
was
made
prisoner
he
was
a
delicate
youth
and
could
ill
endure
the
hardships
much
less
the
barbarous
treatment
to
which
the
prisoners
were
exposed
during
that
memorable
march
he
became
reduced
to
a
skeleton
and
worse
than
that
footsore
so
that
he
could
no
longer
endure
the
pain
of
his
feet
and
ankles
worn
skinless
and
charged
with
the
spines
of
acacias
cactus
and
the
numerous
thorny
plants
in
which
the
dry
soil
of
mexico
is
so
prolific
in
agony
he
fell
down
upon
the
road
ijurra
was
in
command
of
the
guard
from
him
holingsworth
brother
begged
to
be
allowed
the
use
of
a
mule
the
youth
had
known
ijurra
at
san
antonio
and
had
even
lent
him
money
which
was
never
returned
to
your
feet
and
forward
was
ijurra
answer
i
can
not
move
a
step
said
the
youth
despairingly
can
not
we
shall
see
whether
you
can
here
pablo
continued
he
addressing
himself
to
one
of
the
soldiers
of
the
guard
give
this
fellow
the
spur
he
is
restive
the
ruffian
soldier
approached
with
fixed
bayonet
seriously
intending
to
use
its
point
on
the
poor
wayworn
invalid
the
latter
rose
with
an
effort
and
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
keep
on
but
his
resolution
again
failed
him
he
could
not
endure
the
agonising
pain
and
after
staggering
a
pace
or
two
he
fell
up
against
a
rock
i
can
not
he
again
cried
i
can
not
march
farther
let
me
die
here
forward
or
you
die
here
shouted
ijurra
drawing
a
pistol
from
his
belt
and
cocking
it
evidently
with
the
determination
to
carry
out
his
threat
forward
i
can
not
faintly
replied
the
youth
forward
or
i
fire
fire
cried
the
young
man
throwing
open
the
flaps
of
his
and
making
one
last
effort
to
stand
erect
you
are
scarce
worth
a
bullet
said
the
monster
with
a
sneer
at
the
same
instant
he
levelled
his
pistol
at
the
breast
of
his
victim
and
fired
when
the
smoke
was
blown
aside
the
body
of
young
holingsworth
was
seen
lying
at
the
base
of
the
rock
doubled
up
dead
a
thrill
of
horror
ran
through
the
line
of
captives
even
their
habitually
brutal
guards
were
touched
by
such
wanton
barbarity
the
brother
of
the
youth
was
not
six
yards
from
the
spot
tightly
bound
and
witness
of
the
whole
scene
fancy
his
feelings
at
that
moment
no
wonder
continued
the
texan
no
wonder
that
harding
holingsworth
do
stand
upon
ceremony
as
to
where
and
when
he
may
attack
rafael
ijurra
i
verily
believe
that
the
presence
of
the
would
restrain
him
from
taking
vengeance
it
ai
to
be
wondered
at
in
hopes
that
my
companion
might
help
me
to
some
knowledge
of
the
family
at
the
hacienda
i
guided
the
conversation
in
that
direction
and
don
ramon
de
vargas
is
ijurra
uncle
sure
enough
he
must
be
ha
i
did
not
think
of
that
don
ramon
the
uncle
i
ought
to
have
known
him
this
morning
that
confounded
i
drank
knocked
him
out
of
my
mind
altogether
i
have
seen
the
old
fellow
several
times
he
used
to
come
to
san
antonio
once
on
business
with
the
merchants
there
i
remember
too
he
once
brought
a
daughter
with
him
splendid
girl
that
and
no
mistake
faith
she
crazed
half
the
young
fellows
in
san
antonio
and
there
was
no
end
of
duels
about
her
she
used
to
ride
wild
horses
and
fling
the
lazo
like
a
comanche
but
what
am
i
talking
about
that
mezcal
got
into
my
brains
sure
enough
it
must
have
been
you
chased
sure
as
shooting
it
was
probable
enough
i
replied
in
a
careless
way
my
companion
little
knew
the
deep
feverish
interest
his
remarks
were
exciting
or
the
struggle
it
was
costing
me
to
conceal
my
emotions
one
thing
i
longed
to
learn
from
him
whether
any
of
these
amorous
duellists
had
been
favoured
with
the
approbation
of
the
lady
i
longed
to
put
this
question
and
yet
the
absolute
dread
of
the
answer
restrained
my
tongue
i
remained
silent
till
the
opportunity
had
passed
the
of
horses
coming
rapidly
from
the
rear
interrupted
the
conversation
without
surprise
i
perceived
that
it
was
holingsworth
and
the
rangers
who
had
been
left
at
the
hacienda
captain
warfield
said
the
tennessean
as
he
spurred
alongside
my
conduct
no
doubt
surprises
you
i
shall
be
able
to
explain
it
to
satisfaction
when
time
permits
it
a
long
story
a
painful
one
to
me
you
will
not
require
it
from
me
now
this
much
let
me
say
for
good
reason
i
hold
rafael
ijurra
as
my
most
deadly
foe
came
to
mexico
to
kill
that
and
by
the
eternal
if
i
do
succeed
i
care
not
who
kills
you
have
then
with
a
feeling
of
relief
i
put
the
question
for
i
read
he
answer
in
the
look
of
disappointed
vengeance
that
gleamed
in
the
eyes
of
the
tennessean
i
was
not
permitted
to
finish
the
interrogatory
he
knew
what
i
was
going
to
ask
and
interrupted
me
with
the
reply
no
no
the
villain
has
escaped
but
by
the
rest
of
the
emphatic
vow
was
inaudible
but
the
wild
glance
that
flashed
from
the
speaker
eye
expressed
his
deep
purpose
more
plainly
than
words
the
next
moment
he
fell
back
to
his
place
in
the
troop
and
with
his
head
slightly
bent
forward
rode
on
in
silence
his
dark
taciturn
features
were
lit
up
at
intervals
by
an
ominous
gleam
showing
that
he
still
brooded
over
his
unavenged
wrong
chapter
twelve
the
yellow
domino
the
next
two
days
i
passed
in
feverish
restlessness
conduct
had
quite
disconcerted
my
plans
from
the
concluding
sentences
of
isolina
note
i
had
construed
an
invitation
to
revisit
the
hacienda
in
some
more
quiet
guise
than
that
of
a
filibustero
but
after
what
had
transpired
i
could
not
muster
courage
to
present
myself
under
any
pretence
it
was
not
likely
i
should
be
welcome
i
the
associate
nay
the
commander
of
the
man
who
had
attempted
to
take
the
life
of
a
nephew
a
cousin
don
ramon
had
stipulated
for
a
little
rudeness
he
had
had
the
full
measure
of
his
bargain
and
a
good
deal
more
he
could
not
otherwise
than
think
so
were
i
to
present
myself
at
the
hacienda
i
could
not
be
else
than
coldly
received
in
short
unwelcome
i
thought
of
apologies
and
pretexts
but
to
no
purpose
for
two
days
i
remained
in
vacillating
indecision
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
of
her
who
engrossed
my
thoughts
news
from
a
grand
ball
to
be
given
in
the
city
this
bit
of
gossip
fell
upon
my
ear
without
producing
the
slightest
impression
for
i
cared
little
for
dancing
and
less
for
grand
balls
in
early
youth
i
had
liked
both
but
not
then
the
thing
would
at
once
have
passed
from
my
thoughts
had
it
not
been
for
some
additional
information
imparted
at
the
same
time
which
to
me
at
once
rendered
the
ball
attractive
the
information
i
allude
to
was
that
the
ball
was
got
up
by
authority
and
would
be
upon
a
grand
scale
its
object
was
political
in
other
words
it
was
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
about
a
friendly
intercourse
between
the
conquerors
and
the
conquered
a
desirable
end
every
effort
would
be
made
to
draw
out
the
native
society
and
let
them
see
that
we
yankee
officers
were
not
such
barbarians
as
they
affected
to
deem
and
in
reality
pronounced
us
it
was
known
so
stated
my
informant
that
many
families
of
the
ayankieados
would
be
present
and
in
order
to
make
it
pleasanter
for
those
who
feared
the
ball
was
to
be
a
masked
one
baile
de
the
ayankieados
are
to
be
there
and
she
my
heart
bounded
with
new
hope
and
i
resolved
to
make
one
of
the
maskers
not
that
i
intended
to
go
in
in
my
slender
wardrobe
was
a
civilian
dress
proper
cut
and
tolerably
well
preserved
that
would
answer
my
purpose
the
ball
was
to
come
off
on
the
night
following
that
on
which
i
had
word
of
it
my
suspense
would
be
short
the
time
appeared
long
enough
but
at
length
the
he
arrived
and
mounting
my
good
steed
i
started
off
for
the
city
a
brisk
ride
of
two
hours
brought
me
on
the
ground
and
i
found
that
i
was
late
enough
to
be
fashionable
as
i
entered
the
i
saw
that
most
of
the
company
had
arrived
and
the
floor
was
grouped
with
dancers
it
was
evident
the
affair
was
a
success
there
were
four
or
five
hundred
persons
present
nearly
half
of
them
ladies
many
were
in
character
costumes
as
tyrolese
peasants
andalusian
bavarian
wallachian
boyards
turkish
sultanas
and
indian
belles
a
greater
number
were
disguised
in
the
ungraceful
domino
while
not
a
few
appeared
in
regular
evening
dress
most
of
the
ladies
wore
masks
some
simply
hid
their
faces
behind
the
coquettish
while
others
permitted
their
charms
to
be
gazed
upon
as
the
time
passed
on
and
an
occasional
de
strengthened
the
nerves
of
the
company
the
uncovered
faces
became
more
numerous
and
masks
got
lost
or
put
away
as
for
the
gentlemen
a
number
of
them
also
wore
masks
some
were
in
costume
but
uniforms
predominated
stamping
the
ball
with
a
military
character
it
was
not
a
little
singular
to
see
a
number
of
officers
mingling
in
the
throng
these
were
of
course
prisoners
on
and
their
more
brilliant
uniforms
of
french
patterns
contrasted
oddly
with
the
plain
blue
dresses
of
their
conquerors
the
presence
of
these
prisoners
in
the
full
glitter
of
their
was
not
exactly
in
good
taste
but
a
moment
reflection
convinced
one
it
was
not
a
matter
of
choice
with
them
poor
fellows
had
they
abided
by
the
laws
of
etiquette
they
could
not
have
been
there
and
no
doubt
they
were
as
desirous
of
shaking
their
legs
in
the
dance
as
the
gayest
of
their
captors
indeed
in
this
species
of
rivalry
they
far
outstripped
the
latter
i
spent
but
little
time
in
observing
these
peculiarities
but
one
idea
engrossed
my
mind
and
that
was
to
find
isolina
de
vargas
no
easy
task
amid
such
a
multitude
of
maskers
among
the
uncovered
faces
she
was
not
i
soon
scanned
them
all
or
rather
glanced
at
them
it
needed
no
scanning
to
recognise
hers
if
there
she
was
one
of
the
and
i
addressed
myself
to
a
close
observation
of
the
en
and
the
dominoes
hopeless
enough
appeared
the
prospect
of
recognising
her
but
a
little
hope
sustained
me
in
the
reflection
that
being
myself
uncovered
she
might
recognise
when
a
full
had
passed
away
and
my
surveillance
was
still
unrewarded
this
hope
died
within
me
and
what
may
appear
strange
i
began
to
wish
she
was
there
if
present
thought
i
she
must
have
seen
me
ere
this
and
to
have
taken
no
notice
a
little
pang
of
chagrin
accompanied
this
reflection
i
flung
myself
upon
a
seat
and
endeavoured
to
assume
an
air
of
indifference
though
i
was
far
from
feeling
indifferent
and
my
eyes
as
before
kept
eagerly
scanning
the
fair
masters
now
and
then
the
of
an
ankle
i
had
seen
isolina
or
the
elliptical
sweep
of
a
fine
figure
inspired
me
with
fresh
hope
but
as
the
mascaritas
who
owned
them
were
near
enough
to
have
seen
and
yet
took
no
notice
of
me
i
conjectured
in
fact
that
none
of
them
was
she
indeed
a
ankle
is
no
distinctive
mark
among
the
fair
of
mexico
at
length
a
pair
of
unusually
neat
ones
supporting
a
figure
of
such
superb
outlines
that
even
the
ungraceful
domino
could
not
conceal
them
came
under
my
eyes
and
riveted
my
attention
my
heart
beat
wildly
as
i
gazed
i
could
not
help
the
belief
that
the
lady
in
the
yellow
domino
was
isolina
de
vargas
she
was
waltzing
with
a
young
dragoon
officer
and
as
they
passed
me
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
approached
the
orbit
of
the
dance
in
order
to
keep
them
under
my
eyes
as
they
passed
me
a
second
time
i
fancied
the
lady
regarded
me
through
her
mask
i
fancied
i
saw
her
start
i
was
almost
sure
it
was
isolina
my
feeling
was
now
that
of
jealousy
the
young
officer
was
one
of
the
elegant
gentlemen
of
the
service
a
professed
lady
killer
a
fellow
who
notwithstanding
his
deficiency
of
brains
was
ever
welcome
among
women
she
seemed
to
press
closely
to
him
as
they
whirled
around
while
her
head
rested
languishingly
upon
his
shoulder
she
appeared
to
be
with
her
partner
i
could
scarcely
endure
the
agony
of
my
fancies
it
was
a
relief
to
me
when
the
music
ceased
and
the
waltz
ended
the
circle
broke
up
and
the
waltzers
scattered
in
different
directions
but
my
eyes
followed
only
the
dragoon
officer
and
his
partner
he
conducted
her
to
a
seat
and
then
placing
himself
by
her
side
the
two
appeared
to
engage
in
an
earnest
and
interesting
conversation
with
me
politeness
was
now
out
of
the
question
i
had
grown
as
jealous
as
a
tiger
and
i
drew
near
enough
become
a
listener
the
lowness
of
the
tone
in
which
conversed
precluded
the
possibility
of
my
hearing
much
of
what
was
said
but
i
could
make
out
that
the
spark
was
coaxing
his
partner
to
remove
her
mask
the
voice
that
replied
was
surely
isolina
i
could
myself
have
torn
the
silken
screen
from
her
face
through
very
vexation
but
i
was
saved
that
indiscretion
for
the
request
of
her
cavalier
seemed
to
prevail
and
the
next
instant
the
mask
was
removed
by
the
lady
own
hand
shade
of
erebus
what
did
i
see
she
was
black
a
not
black
as
ebony
but
nearly
so
with
thick
lips
high
and
a
row
of
short
kinky
curls
dangling
over
the
arch
of
her
glistening
forehead
my
astonishment
though
perhaps
of
a
more
agreeable
kind
was
not
greater
than
that
of
the
dragoon
lieutenant
who
by
the
way
was
also
a
southerner
at
sight
of
his
partner
face
he
started
as
if
a
shot
had
winded
him
and
after
a
few
excuses
he
rose
with
an
air
of
extreme
and
hurrying
off
hid
himself
behind
the
crowd
the
coloured
lady
mortified
as
i
presumed
she
must
be
hastily
readjusted
her
mask
and
rising
from
her
seat
glided
away
from
the
scene
of
her
humiliation
i
gazed
after
her
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
curiosity
and
pity
i
saw
her
pass
out
of
the
door
alone
evidently
with
the
intention
of
leaving
the
ball
i
fancied
she
had
departed
as
her
domino
conspicuous
by
its
bright
yellow
colour
was
no
more
seen
among
the
maskers
chapter
thirteen
the
blue
domino
thus
disappointed
i
gave
up
all
hope
of
meeting
her
for
whose
sake
i
had
come
to
the
ball
she
was
either
there
or
did
not
wish
to
be
recognised
even
by
the
latter
supposition
was
the
more
bitter
of
the
two
and
goaded
by
it
and
one
or
two
other
uncongenial
thoughts
i
paid
frequent
visits
to
the
where
wine
flowed
freely
a
cup
or
two
drove
the
out
of
my
mind
and
after
a
while
i
grew
more
companionable
and
determined
to
enjoy
myself
like
others
around
me
i
had
not
danced
as
yet
but
the
wine
soon
got
to
my
toes
as
well
as
into
my
head
and
i
resolved
to
put
myself
in
motion
with
the
first
partner
that
offered
i
soon
found
one
a
blue
domino
that
came
right
in
my
way
as
if
the
fates
had
determined
we
should
dance
together
the
lady
was
engaged
for
the
next
she
would
be
most
happy
this
by
the
way
was
said
in
which
would
have
taken
me
by
surprise
had
i
not
known
that
there
were
many
french
people
living
in
c
as
in
all
the
large
cities
of
mexico
they
are
usually
jewellers
dentists
milliners
or
rather
artisans
of
that
class
who
drive
a
lucrative
trade
among
the
to
know
there
were
french
people
in
the
place
was
to
be
certain
you
would
find
them
at
the
ball
and
there
were
they
numbers
of
them
pirouetting
about
and
comporting
themselves
with
the
gay
characteristic
of
their
nation
i
was
not
surprised
then
when
my
blue
domino
addressed
me
in
french
a
french
conjectured
i
as
soon
as
she
spoke
milliner
or
no
it
mattered
not
to
me
i
wanted
a
dancing
partner
and
after
another
phrase
or
two
in
the
same
sweet
tongue
away
went
she
and
i
in
the
curving
whirl
of
a
waltz
after
sailing
once
round
the
room
i
had
two
quite
new
and
distinct
impressions
upon
my
mind
the
first
that
i
had
a
partner
could
a
thing
not
to
be
met
with
every
day
my
blue
domino
seemed
to
have
no
feet
under
her
but
floated
around
me
as
if
borne
upon
the
air
for
the
moment
i
fancied
myself
in
ranelagh
or
mabille
my
other
impression
was
that
my
arm
encircled
as
pretty
a
waist
as
ever
was
clasped
by
a
lover
there
was
a
pleasing
rotundity
about
it
combined
with
a
general
symmetry
of
form
and
serpentine
yieldiness
of
movement
that
rendered
dancing
with
such
a
partner
both
easy
and
delightful
my
observation
at
the
moment
was
that
if
the
face
of
the
modiste
bore
any
sort
of
proportion
to
her
figure
she
needed
not
have
come
so
far
from
france
to
push
her
fortune
with
such
a
partner
i
could
not
otherwise
than
waltz
well
and
never
better
than
upon
that
occasion
we
were
soon
under
the
observation
of
the
company
and
became
the
cynosure
of
a
circle
this
i
did
not
relish
and
drawing
my
blue
domino
to
one
side
we
waltzed
towards
a
seat
into
which
i
handed
her
with
the
usual
polite
expression
of
thanks
this
seat
was
in
a
little
recess
or
blind
window
where
two
persons
might
freely
converse
without
fear
of
an
i
had
no
desire
to
run
away
from
a
partner
who
danced
so
well
though
she
were
a
modiste
there
was
room
for
two
upon
the
bench
and
i
asked
permission
to
sit
beside
her
oh
certainly
was
the
frank
reply
and
will
you
permit
me
to
remain
with
you
till
the
music
recommences
if
you
desire
it
and
dance
with
you
again
with
pleasure
monsieur
if
it
suit
your
convenience
but
is
there
no
other
who
claims
you
as
a
partner
no
other
in
this
assemblage
you
would
prefer
not
one
i
assure
you
you
are
the
only
one
present
with
whom
i
care
to
dance
as
i
said
this
i
thought
i
perceived
a
slight
movement
that
indicated
some
emotion
it
was
a
gallant
speech
and
the
modiste
is
pleased
with
the
compliment
thought
i
her
reply
it
flatters
me
sir
that
you
prefer
my
company
to
that
of
the
many
splendid
beauties
who
are
in
this
saloon
though
it
may
gratify
me
still
more
you
knew
who
i
the
last
clause
was
uttered
with
an
emphasis
and
followed
by
a
sigh
poor
girl
thought
i
she
fancies
that
i
mistake
her
for
some
grand
dame
that
if
i
knew
her
real
position
her
humble
avocation
i
should
not
longer
care
to
dance
with
her
in
that
she
is
mistaken
i
make
no
distinction
between
a
milliner
and
a
marchioness
especially
in
a
there
grace
and
beauty
alone
guide
to
preference
after
giving
way
to
some
such
reflections
i
replied
it
is
my
regret
not
to
have
the
happiness
of
knowing
who
you
are
and
it
is
not
possible
i
ever
may
unless
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
remove
your
mask
ah
monsieur
what
you
request
is
impossible
impossible
and
why
may
i
ask
because
were
you
to
see
my
face
i
should
not
have
you
for
my
partner
in
the
next
dance
and
to
say
the
truth
i
should
regret
that
since
you
waltz
so
admirably
oh
refusal
and
flattery
in
the
same
breath
no
i
am
sure
face
will
never
be
the
means
of
your
losing
a
partner
come
let
me
beg
of
you
to
remove
that
envious
counterfeit
let
us
converse
freely
face
to
face
am
not
masked
as
you
see
in
truth
sir
you
have
no
reason
to
hide
your
face
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
many
other
men
in
this
room
milliner
thought
i
bravo
ranelagh
vive
la
mabille
thanks
amiable
masker
i
replied
but
you
are
too
generous
you
flatter
me
it
is
worth
while
rejoined
she
interrupting
me
it
improves
your
cheek
blushes
become
you
ha
ha
ha
the
deuce
i
ejaculated
half
aloud
this
du
is
laughing
at
me
but
what
you
she
continued
suddenly
changing
her
tone
you
are
not
a
mexican
are
you
soldier
or
civilian
what
would
you
take
me
for
a
poet
from
your
pale
face
but
more
from
the
manner
in
which
i
have
heard
you
sigh
i
have
not
sighed
since
we
sat
down
no
but
before
we
sat
down
what
in
the
dance
no
before
the
dance
ha
then
you
observed
me
before
o
yes
your
plain
dress
rendered
you
conspicuous
among
so
many
uniforms
besides
your
manner
what
manner
i
asked
with
some
degree
of
confusion
fearing
that
in
my
search
after
isolina
i
had
committed
some
stupid
piece
of
four
abstraction
and
by
the
way
had
you
not
little
for
a
yellow
domino
a
yellow
domino
repeated
i
raising
my
hand
to
my
head
as
though
it
cost
me
an
effort
to
remember
it
a
yellow
domino
ay
ay
a
rejoined
my
companion
with
sarcastic
emphasis
a
yellow
domino
who
waltzed
with
a
young
officer
not
by
the
way
ah
i
think
i
remember
well
i
think
you
rejoined
my
tormentor
and
well
too
you
took
sufficient
pains
to
ah
aw
yes
stammered
i
i
thought
you
were
conning
verses
to
her
and
as
you
had
not
the
advantage
of
her
were
making
them
to
her
feet
ha
ha
what
an
idea
of
yours
in
the
end
she
was
not
ungenerous
she
let
you
see
the
face
the
devil
exclaimed
i
starting
you
saw
the
then
ha
ha
ha
laughed
she
of
course
i
saw
the
denouement
ha
ha
was
it
very
replied
i
not
much
relishing
the
joke
but
endeavouring
to
join
my
companion
in
the
laugh
how
silly
the
spark
looked
ha
ha
very
silly
indeed
ha
ha
ha
and
how
disappointed
eh
how
disappointed
looked
monsieur
oh
ah
i
no
i
assure
you
i
had
no
interest
in
the
affair
i
was
not
at
least
not
as
you
imagine
ah
the
feeling
uppermost
in
my
mind
was
pity
for
the
poor
girl
and
you
really
pity
her
this
question
was
put
with
an
earnestness
that
sounded
somewhat
strange
at
the
moment
i
really
did
the
creature
seemed
so
mortified
she
seemed
mortified
did
she
of
course
she
left
the
room
immediately
after
and
has
not
returned
since
no
doubt
she
has
gone
home
poor
devil
poor
devil
is
that
the
extent
of
your
pity
well
after
all
it
must
be
confessed
she
was
a
superb
deception
a
finer
dancer
i
never
saw
i
beg
pardon
i
except
my
present
partner
a
good
foot
an
elegant
figure
and
then
to
turn
out
what
i
fear
monsieur
you
americans
are
not
very
gallant
towards
the
ladies
of
colour
it
is
different
here
in
mexico
which
you
term
i
felt
the
rebuke
to
change
the
subject
continued
she
are
you
a
poet
i
do
not
deserve
the
name
of
poet
yet
i
will
not
deny
that
i
have
made
verses
i
thought
as
much
what
an
instinct
i
have
o
that
i
could
prevail
upon
you
to
write
some
verses
to
me
what
without
knowing
either
your
name
or
having
looked
upon
your
face
i
must
at
least
set
the
features
i
am
called
upon
to
praise
ah
monsieur
you
little
know
were
i
to
unmask
those
features
i
should
stand
but
a
poor
chance
of
getting
the
verses
my
plain
face
would
counteract
all
your
poetic
inspirations
shade
of
lucretia
this
is
no
needlewoman
though
dealing
in
weapons
quite
as
sharp
modiste
indeed
i
have
been
labouring
under
a
mistake
this
is
some
some
grand
lady
i
had
now
grown
more
than
curious
to
look
upon
the
face
of
my
companion
her
conversation
had
won
me
a
woman
who
could
talk
so
i
fancied
could
not
be
such
an
enchanting
spirit
could
not
be
hidden
behind
a
plain
face
besides
there
was
the
gracefulness
of
form
the
small
gloved
hand
the
dainty
foot
and
ankle
demonstrated
in
the
dance
a
voice
that
rang
like
music
and
the
flash
of
a
superb
eye
which
i
could
perceive
even
through
the
mask
beyond
a
doubt
she
was
beautiful
lady
i
said
speaking
with
more
earnestness
than
ever
i
entreat
you
to
unmask
yourself
were
it
not
in
a
i
should
beg
the
favour
upon
my
knees
and
were
i
to
grant
it
you
could
hardly
rise
soon
enough
and
pronounce
your
lukewarm
hat
monsieur
think
of
the
yellow
domino
you
take
pleasure
in
mortifying
me
you
deem
me
capable
of
such
fickleness
suppose
for
a
moment
you
are
not
what
the
world
calls
beautiful
you
could
not
by
removing
your
mask
also
strip
yourself
of
the
attractions
of
your
conversation
of
that
voice
that
thrills
through
my
heart
of
that
grace
exhibited
in
your
every
movement
with
such
endowments
how
could
a
woman
appear
if
your
face
was
even
as
black
as
hers
of
the
yellow
domino
i
verily
believe
i
could
not
perceive
its
darkness
ha
ha
ha
take
care
what
you
say
monsieur
i
presume
you
are
not
more
indulgent
than
the
rest
of
your
sex
and
well
know
i
that
with
you
men
ugliness
is
the
greatest
crime
of
a
woman
i
am
different
i
swear
do
not
perjure
yourself
as
you
will
if
i
but
remove
my
mask
i
tell
you
sir
that
in
spite
of
all
the
fine
qualities
you
imagine
me
to
possess
i
am
a
vision
that
would
horrify
you
to
look
upon
impossible
your
form
your
grace
your
voice
oh
unmask
i
accept
every
consequence
for
the
favour
i
ask
then
be
it
as
you
wish
but
i
shall
not
be
the
means
of
punishing
you
receive
from
your
own
hands
the
chastisement
of
your
curiosity
you
permit
me
then
thanks
thanks
it
is
fastened
behind
yes
the
knot
is
here
now
i
have
it
so
so
with
trembling
fingers
i
undid
the
string
and
pulled
off
the
piece
of
taffety
shade
of
sheba
what
did
i
see
the
mask
fell
from
my
fingers
as
though
it
had
been
iron
at
a
cherry
heat
astonishment
caused
me
to
drop
it
rather
say
horror
horror
at
beholding
the
face
underneath
the
face
the
yellow
yes
there
was
the
same
negress
with
her
thick
lips
high
and
the
little
kinks
hanging
like
corkscrews
over
her
temples
i
knew
not
either
what
to
say
or
do
my
gallantry
was
clean
gone
and
although
i
resumed
my
seat
i
remained
perfectly
dumb
had
i
looked
in
a
mirror
at
that
moment
i
should
certainly
have
beheld
the
face
of
a
fool
my
companion
who
seemed
to
have
made
up
her
mind
to
such
a
result
instead
of
being
mortified
burst
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
at
the
same
time
crying
out
in
a
tone
of
raillery
now
monsieur
le
poete
does
my
face
inspire
you
when
may
i
expect
the
verses
soon
never
ah
monsieur
i
fear
you
are
not
more
gallant
to
us
poor
ob
colour
than
your
countryman
the
lieutenant
ha
ha
ha
i
was
too
much
ashamed
of
my
own
conduct
and
too
deeply
wounded
by
her
reproach
to
make
reply
fortunately
her
continued
laughter
offered
me
an
opportunity
to
mutter
some
broken
phrases
accompanied
by
very
clumsy
gestures
and
thus
take
myself
off
certainly
in
all
my
life
i
never
made
a
more
awkward
adieu
i
walked
or
rather
towards
the
entrance
determined
to
leave
the
and
gallop
home
on
reaching
the
door
my
curiosity
grew
stronger
than
my
shame
and
i
resolved
to
take
a
parting
look
at
this
singular
ethiopian
the
blue
domino
still
within
the
niche
caught
my
eye
at
once
but
on
looking
up
to
the
face
gracious
heaven
was
i
stood
as
if
turned
into
stone
my
gaze
was
fixed
upon
her
face
and
i
could
not
take
it
off
she
was
looking
at
me
but
oh
the
expression
with
which
those
eyes
regarded
me
that
was
a
glance
to
be
remembered
for
life
she
no
longer
laughed
but
her
proud
lip
seemed
to
curl
with
a
sarcastic
smile
as
of
scorn
i
hesitated
whether
to
return
and
apologise
but
no
it
was
too
late
i
could
have
fallen
upon
my
knees
and
begged
forgiveness
it
was
too
late
i
should
only
subject
myself
to
further
ridicule
from
that
capricious
spirit
perhaps
my
look
of
remorse
had
more
effect
than
words
i
thought
her
expression
changed
her
glance
became
more
tender
as
if
inviting
me
back
perhaps
at
this
moment
a
man
approached
and
without
ceremony
seated
himself
by
her
side
his
face
was
towards
me
i
recognised
ijurra
they
converse
is
it
of
is
it
of
if
so
he
will
laugh
a
world
to
see
that
man
laugh
and
know
it
is
at
if
he
do
i
shall
soon
cast
off
the
load
that
is
crushing
my
heart
he
laughs
not
not
even
a
smile
is
traceable
on
his
sombre
features
she
has
not
told
him
and
well
for
him
she
has
not
prudence
perchance
restrains
her
tongue
she
might
guess
the
result

are
on
their
feet

her
to
the

some

a
deep
long
draught
a
few
seconds
spent
in
buckling
on
my
sword
a
few
more
in
reaching
the
gate
one
spring
and
my
saddled
steed
was
under
me
i
rode
with
desperate
heart
and
hot
head
but
the
cool
the
motion
of
my
horse
and
his
proud
spirit
mingling
with
mine
gave
me
relief
and
i
soon
felt
calmer
on
reaching
the
rancheria
i
found
my
lieutenants
still
up
eating
their
rudely
cooked
supper
as
my
appetite
was
roused
i
joined
them
at
their
meal
and
their
friendly
converse
restored
for
the
time
my
equanimity
chapter
fourteen
a
dread
feeling
is
jealousy
mortified
vanity
or
whatever
you
may
designate
the
disappointment
of
love
i
have
experienced
the
sting
of
shame
the
blight
of
broken
fortune
the
fear
of
death
itself
yet
none
of
these
ever
wrung
my
heart
so
rudely
as
the
pang
of
an
unreciprocated
passion
the
former
are
but
transient
trials
and
their
bitterness
soon
has
an
end
jealousy
like
the
tooth
of
the
serpent
carries
poison
in
its
sting
and
long
and
slow
is
the
healing
of
its
wound
well
knew
he
this
that
master
of
the
human
heart
iago
prayer
was
not
meant
for
mockery
to
drown
my
mortification
i
had
drunk
wine
freely
at
the
ball
and
on
returning
home
had
continued
my
potations
with
the
more
fiery
spirit
of
catalan
by
this
means
i
gained
relief
and
sleep
but
only
of
short
duration
long
before
day
i
was
awake
awake
to
the
double
bitterness
of
jealousy
and
shame
awake
to
both
mental
and
physical
pain
for
the
fumes
of
the
vile
stuff
i
had
drunk
wrecked
my
brain
as
though
they
would
burst
open
my
skull
an
ounce
of
opium
would
not
have
set
me
to
sleep
again
and
i
tossed
on
my
couch
like
one
labouring
under
delirium
of
course
the
incidents
of
the
preceding
night
were
uppermost
in
my
mind
every
scene
and
action
that
had
occurred
were
as
plainly
before
me
as
if
i
was
again
witnessing
them
every
effort
to
alienate
my
thoughts
and
fix
them
upon
some
other
theme
proved
vain
and
idle
they
ever
returned
to
the
same
circle
of
reflections
in
the
centre
of
which
was
isolina
de
vargas
i
thought
of
all
that
had
passed
of
all
she
had
said
i
remembered
every
word
how
bitterly
i
remembered
that
scornful
laugh
how
bitterly
that
sarcastic
smile
when
the
double
mask
was
removed
the
very
remembrance
of
her
beauty
pained
me
it
was
now
to
me
as
to
tantalus
the
crystal
waters
never
to
be
tasted
before
i
had
formed
hopes
had
indulged
in
prospective
dreams
the
masquerade
adventure
had
dissipated
them
i
no
longer
hoped
no
longer
permitted
myself
to
dream
of
pleasant
times
to
come
i
felt
that
i
was
scorned
this
feeling
produced
a
momentary
revulsion
in
my
thoughts
there
were
moments
when
i
hated
her
and
vengeful
impulses
careered
across
my
soul
these
were
fleeting
moments
again
before
me
rose
that
lovely
form
that
proud
grand
spirit
in
the
full
entirety
of
its
power
and
again
my
soul
became
absorbed
in
admiration
and
yielded
itself
to
its
hopeless
passion
it
was
far
from
being
my
first
love
and
thus
experienced
i
could
reason
upon
it
i
felt
certain
it
was
to
be
the
strongest
and
stormiest
of
my
life
i
know
of
three
loves
distinct
in
kind
and
power
first
when
the
passion
is
reciprocated
when
the
heart
of
the
beloved
yields
back
thought
for
thought
and
throb
for
throb
without
one
reserved
pulsation
this
is
bliss
upon
earth
not
always
ending
perchance
in
a
species
of
sublimated
friendship
to
have
is
no
longer
to
desire
the
second
is
love
entirely
unrequited
love
that
never
knew
word
or
smile
of
encouragement
no
soft
whisper
to
fan
it
into
flame
no
ray
of
hope
to
feed
upon
such
dies
of
inanition
the
sooner
that
its
object
is
out
of
the
way
and
absence
in
time
will
conquer
it
the
third
is
the
love
that
dotes
yet
doubts
that
doubts
but
never
dies
no
never
the
jealousy
that
pains
only
sustains
it
it
lives
on
now
happy
in
the
honeyed
conviction
of
triumph
now
smarting
under
real
or
fancied
scorn
on
on
so
long
as
its
object
is
accessible
to
sight
or
hearing
no
matter
how
worthless
that
object
may
be
or
become
no
matter
how
lost
or
fallen
love
regards
not
this
it
has
nought
to
do
with
the
moral
part
of
our
nature
beauty
is
the
shrine
of
its
worship
and
beauty
is
not
morality
in
my
own
mind
i
am
conscious
of
three
elements
or
classes
of
feeling
the
the
and
what
i
may
term
the
the
last
as
distinct
from
either
of
the
other
two
as
oil
from
spirits
or
water
to
the
last
belongs
love
which
i
repeat
again
has
no
sympathy
with
the
moral
feelings
of
our
nature
but
alas
as
one
might
almost
believe
with
their
opposite
even
a
plain
but
wicked
coquette
will
captivate
more
hearts
than
a
beautiful
saint
and
the
brilliant
murderess
ere
now
has
made
conquests
at
the
very
foot
of
the
scaffold
it
pains
me
to
pronounce
these
convictions
derived
as
they
are
from
experience
there
is
as
little
gain
as
pleasure
in
so
doing
but
popularity
must
be
sacrificed
at
the
shrine
of
truth
for
the
sake
of
effect
i
shall
not
play
false
with
philosophy
rough
ranger
as
i
was
i
had
studied
psychology
sufficiently
to
understand
these
truths
and
i
endeavoured
to
analyse
my
passion
for
this
girl
or
woman
to
discover
i
loved
her
her
physical
beauty
was
of
the
highest
order
and
that
no
doubt
was
an
element
but
it
was
not
all
had
i
merely
looked
upon
this
beauty
under
ordinary
circumstances
that
is
without
coming
in
contact
with
the
spirit
that
animated
it
i
might
have
loved
her
or
i
might
not
it
was
the
spirit
then
that
had
won
me
though
not
alone
the
same
gem
in
a
less
brilliant
setting
might
have
failed
to
draw
my
admiration
i
was
the
captive
both
of
the
spirit
and
the
form
soul
and
body
had
in
producing
my
passion
and
this
may
account
for
its
suddenness
and
profundity
why
i
loved
her
person
i
knew
i
was
not
ignorant
of
the
laws
of
beauty
but
why
the
spirit
i
knew
not
certainly
not
from
any
idea
i
had
formed
of
her
high
qualities
i
had
no
evidence
of
these
of
her
courage
even
to
daring
i
had
proof
of
energy
and
determined
will
of
the
power
of
thought
quick
and
versatile
but
these
are
not
qualities
they
are
not
even
true
she
wept
over
her
slain
steed
humanity
i
have
knows
a
hardened
weep
bitter
tears
for
her
cat
she
refused
to
take
from
me
my
horse
generosity
she
had
a
thousand
within
sight
alas
in
thus
reviewing
all
that
had
passed
between
myself
and
the
beautiful
isolina
in
search
of
her
moral
qualities
i
met
with
but
little
success
mystery
of
our
nature
i
loved
her
not
the
less
and
yet
my
passion
was
pure
and
i
do
not
believe
that
my
heart
was
wicked
mystery
of
our
nature
he
who
reads
all
hearts
alone
can
solve
thee
i
loved
without
reason
but
i
loved
now
without
hope
hope
i
had
before
that
night
her
glance
through
the
turrets
her
note
its
contents
a
word
a
look
at
other
times
had
inspired
me
with
hopes
however
faint
they
were
the
incident
of
the
had
crushed
them
ijurra
dark
face
kept
lowering
before
me
even
in
my
visions
he
was
always
by
her
side
what
was
between
the
two
perhaps
a
nearer
relationship
than
that
of
cousin
perhaps
they
were
affianced
married
the
thought
maddened
me
i
could
rest
upon
my
couch
no
longer
i
rose
and
sought
the
open
air
i
climbed
to
the
azotea
and
paced
it
to
and
fro
as
the
tiger
walks
his
cage
my
thoughts
were
wild
and
my
movements
without
method
to
add
to
the
bitterness
of
my
reflections
i
now
discovered
that
i
had
sustained
a
loss
not
in
property
but
something
that
annoyed
me
still
more
i
had
lost
the
order
and
its
enclosure
the
note
of
don
ramon
i
had
dropped
them
on
the
day
in
which
they
were
received
and
i
believed
in
the
patio
of
the
hacienda
where
they
must
have
been
picked
up
at
once
if
by
don
ramon
himself
then
all
was
well
but
if
they
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
some
of
the
herdsmen
ill
affected
to
don
ramon
it
might
be
an
awkward
affair
for
that
gentleman
indeed
for
myself
such
negligence
would
scarcely
be
overlooked
at
and
i
had
ill
forebodings
about
the
result
it
was
one
of
my
soul
darkest
hours
from
its
very
darkness
i
might
have
known
that
light
was
near
for
the
proverb
is
equally
true
in
the
moral
as
in
the
material
world
light
near
chapter
fifteen
an
odd
epistle
breakfast
i
hardly
tasted
a
of
chocolate
and
a
small
sugared
cake
the
of
every
mexican
were
brought
and
these
served
me
for
breakfast
a
glass
of
cognac
and
a
havanna
were
more
to
the
purpose
and
helped
to
stay
the
wild
trembling
of
my
nerves
fortunately
there
was
no
duty
to
perform
else
i
could
ill
have
attended
to
it
i
remained
on
the
azotea
till
near
the
storm
raging
within
prevented
me
from
taking
note
of
what
was
passing
around
the
scenes
in
the
piazza
the
rangers
and
their
steeds
the
greasers
in
their
striped
blankets
the
squatted
on
their
the
pretty
poblanas
were
all
unnoticed
by
me
at
intervals
my
eyes
rested
upon
the
walls
of
the
distant
dwelling
it
was
not
so
distant
but
that
a
human
form
could
have
been
distinguished
upon
its
roof
had
one
been
there
there
was
none
and
twenty
ay
fifty
times
did
i
turn
away
my
disappointed
gaze
about
noon
the
serjeant
of
the
guard
reported
that
a
mexican
wished
to
speak
with
me
mechanically
i
gave
orders
for
the
man
to
be
sent
up
but
it
was
not
until
he
appeared
before
me
that
i
thought
of
what
i
was
doing
the
presence
of
the
mexican
at
once
aroused
me
from
my
unpleasant
reverie
i
recognised
him
as
one
of
the
vaqueros
of
don
ramon
de
vargas
the
same
i
had
seen
on
the
plain
during
my
first
interview
with
isolina
there
was
something
in
his
manner
that
betokened
him
a
messenger
a
folded
note
which
he
drew
from
under
his
jerkin
after
having
glanced
around
to
see
whether
he
was
noticed
confirmed
my
observation
i
took
the
note
there
was
no
superscription
nor
did
i
stay
to
look
for
one
my
fingers
trembled
as
i
tore
open
the
seal
as
my
eye
rested
on
the
writing
and
recognised
it
my
heart
throbbed
so
as
almost
to
choke
my
utterance
i
muttered
some
directions
to
the
messenger
and
to
conceal
my
emotion
from
him
i
turned
away
and
proceeded
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
azotea
before
reading
the
note
i
called
back
to
the
man
to
go
below
and
wait
for
an
answer
and
then
relieved
of
his
presence
i
read
as
follows
capitan
allow
me
to
bid
you
a
for
i
presume
that
after
the
fatigues
of
last
night
it
is
but

with
you
yet
do
you
dream
of

sable

provoked
at

of
address
for

rendered
emphatic
by
underlining
it
was
a
letter
to
taunt
me
for
my
ill
behaviour
i
felt
inclined
to
fling
it
down
but
my
eye
wandering
over
the
paper
caught
some
words
that
induced
me
to
read
on

of

who
are
afflicted
by
a
similar
affection
for
the
noble
moro
in
an
evil
hour
your
aim
too
true
alas
robbed
me
of
my
favourite
but
you
offered
to
repay
me
by
yourself
for
well
know
i
that
the
black
is
to
you
dearest
object
upon
indeed
were
i
the
lady
of
your
love
i
should
ill
brook
such
a
divided
affection
well
mio
capitan
i
understood
the
generous
sacrifice
you
would
have
made
and
forbade
it
but
i
know
you
are
desirous
of
cancelling
your
debt
it
is
in
your
power
to
do
so
listen
some
conditions
i
anticipated
would
follow
i
recked
not
of
that
there
was
no
sacrifice
i
was
not
ready
to
make
i
would
have
dared
any
deed
however
wild
to
have
won
that
proud
heart
to
have
inoculated
it
with
the
pain
that
was
wringing
my
own
i
read
on
there
is
a
horse
famed
in
these
parts
as
the
steed
of
the
prairies
cavallo
bianco
de
los
he
is
a
of
course
in
colour
beautiful
in
form
swift
as
the
swallow
but
why
need
i
describe
to
you
the
steed
of
the
prairies
you
are
a
tejano
and
must
have
heard
of
him
ere
this
well
mio
capitan
i
have
long
had
a
desire
a
frantic
one
let
me
add
to
possess
this
horse
i
have
offered
rewards
to
hunters
to
our
own
vaqueros
for
he
sometimes
appears
upon
our
plains
but
to
no
purpose
not
one
of
them
can
capture
though
they
have
often
seen
and
chased
him
some
say
that
he
be
that
he
is
so
fleet
as
to
gallop
or
rather
out
of
sight
in
a
glance
and
that
too
on
the
open
prairie
there
are
those
who
assert
that
he
is
a
phantom
surely
so
beautiful
a
creature
can
not
be
the
devil
besides
i
have
always
heard
and
if
i
recollect
aright
some
one
said
so
last
night
that
the
devil
was
devil
ha
ha
ha
i
rather
welcomed
this
allusion
to
my
misconduct
of
the
preceding
night
for
i
began
to
feel
easier
under
the
perception
that
the
whole
affair
was
thus
treated
in
jest
instead
of
the
anger
and
scorn
i
had
anticipated
with
pleasanter
presentiments
i
read
on
to
the
point
mio
capitan
there
are
some
incredulous
people
who
believe
the
white
steed
of
the
prairies
to
be
a
myth
and
deny
his
existence
altogether
i
know
that
he
exist
and
what
is
more
to
my
present
purpose
he
is
or
but
two
hours
ago
within
ten
miles
of
where
i
am
writing
this
note
one
of
our
vaqueros
saw
him
near
the
banks
of
a
beautiful
arroyo
which
i
know
to
be
his
favourite
ground
for
reasons
known
to
me
the
vaquero
did
not
either
chase
or
molest
him
but
in
breathless
haste
brought
me
the
news
now
capitan
gallant
and
grand
there
is
but
one
who
can
capture
this
famed
horse
and
that
is
your
puissant
self
ah
have
made
captive
what
was
once
at
wild
and
yes
can
do
it
you
and
moro
bring
me
the
white
steed
of
the
prairies
i
shall
cease
to
grieve
for
poor
lola
i
shall
forgive
you
that
i
shall
forgive
all
even
your
rudeness
to
my
double
mask
ha
ha
ha
bring
me
the
white
steed
the
white
steed
isolina
as
i
finished
reading
this
singular
epistle
a
thrill
of
pleasure
ran
through
my
veins
i
dwelt
not
on
the
oddness
of
its
contents
thoroughly
characteristic
of
the
writer
its
meaning
was
clear
enough
i
heard
of
the
white
horse
of
the
prairies
what
hunter
or
trapper
trader
or
traveller
throughout
all
the
wide
borders
of
has
not
many
a
romantic
story
of
him
had
i
listened
to
around
the
blazing
campfire
many
a
tale
of
in
which
the
white
horse
played
hero
for
nearly
a
century
has
he
figured
in
the
legends
of
the
prairie
mariner
a
counterpart
of
the
flying
dutchman
the
of
the
forecastle
like
this
too
ubiquitous
seen
today
scouring
the
sandy
plains
of
the
platte
bounding
over
the
broad
llanos
of
texas
a
thousand
miles
to
the
southward
that
there
existed
a
white
stallion
of
great
speed
and
splendid
proportions
that
there
were
twenty
perhaps
a
hundred
such
among
the
countless
herds
of
that
roam
over
the
great
plains
i
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
i
myself
had
seen
and
chased
more
than
one
that
might
have
been
termed
a
magnificent
animal
and
that
no
ordinary
horse
could
overtake
but
the
one
known
as
the
white
steed
of
the
prairies
had
a
peculiar
marking
that
distinguished
him
from
all
the
rest
ears
were
only
his
ears
and
these
were
of
the
deep
colour
of
ebony
the
rest
of
his
body
mane
and
tail
was
white
as
snow
it
was
to
this
singular
and
mysterious
animal
that
the
letter
pointed
it
was
the
steed
i
was
called
upon
to
capture
the
contents
of
the
note
were
specific
and
plain
one
expression
alone
puzzled
me
have
made
captive
what
was
once
as
wild
and
what
i
asked
myself
i
scarce
dared
to
give
credence
to
the
answer
that
leaped
like
an
exulting
echo
from
out
my
heart
there
was
a
postscript
of
course
but
this
contained
only
business
it
gave
minuter
details
as
to
when
how
and
where
the
white
horse
had
been
seen
and
stated
that
the
bearer
of
the
note
the
vaquero
who
had
seen
him
would
act
as
my
guide
i
pondered
not
long
upon
the
strange
request
its
fulfilment
promised
to
recover
me
the
position
which
but
a
moment
before
i
had
looked
upon
as
lost
for
ever
i
at
once
resolved
upon
the
undertaking
yes
lovely
isolina
if
horse
and
man
can
do
it
ere
another
sun
sets
you
shall
be
mistress
of
the
steed
of
the
chapter
sixteen
the
manada
in
after
with
the
vaquero
for
my
guide
i
rode
quietly
out
of
the
rancheria
a
dozen
rangers
followed
close
behind
and
having
crossed
the
river
at
a
ford
nearly
opposite
the
village
we
struck
off
into
the
on
the
opposite
side
the
men
whom
i
had
chosen
to
accompany
me
were
most
of
them
old
hunters
fellows
who
could
trail
and
crease
with
accurate
aim
i
had
confidence
in
their
skill
and
aided
by
them
i
had
great
hopes
we
should
find
the
game
we
were
in
search
of
my
hopes
however
would
not
have
been
so
sanguine
but
for
another
circumstance
it
was
this
our
guide
had
informed
me
that
when
he
saw
the
white
steed
the
latter
was
in
company
with
a
large
drove
of
mares
a
doubtless
his
harem
he
would
not
be
likely
to
separate
from
them
and
even
if
these
had
since
left
the
ground
they
could
be
the
more
easily
trailed
in
consequence
of
their
numbers
indeed
but
for
this
prospect
our
hunt
would
have
partaken
largely
of
the
character
of
a
chase
the
steed
by
all
accounts
of
him
might
have
been
seen
upon
one
arroyo
and
by
the
banks
of
some
other
stream
a
hundred
miles
off
on
the
morrow
the
presence
of
his
manada
offered
some
guarantee
that
he
might
still
be
near
the
ground
where
the
vaquero
had
marked
him
once
found
i
trusted
to
the
swiftness
of
my
horse
and
my
own
skill
in
the
use
of
the
lazo
as
we
rode
along
i
revealed
to
my
following
the
purpose
of
the
expedition
all
of
them
knew
the
white
steed
by
fame
one
or
two
averred
they
had
seen
him
in
their
prairie
wanderings
the
whole
party
were
delighted
at
the
idea
of
such
a
scout
and
exhibited
as
much
excitement
as
if
i
was
leading
them
to
a
skirmish
with
guerilleros
the
country
through
which
we
passed
was
at
first
a
dense
chapparal
consisting
of
the
various
thorny
shrubs
and
plants
for
which
this
part
of
mexico
is
so
celebrated
the
greater
proportion
belonged
to
the
family
of
and
the
texan
acacias
of
more
than
one
species
there
known
as
aloes
too
formed
part
of
the
to
the
no
small
annoyance
of
the
traveller
the
wild
species
known
as
the
or
whose
core
is
cooked
for
food
whose
fibrous
leaves
serve
for
the
manufacture
of
thread
cordage
or
cloth
while
its
sap
yields
by
distillation
the
fiery
here
and
there
a
tree
yucca
grew
by
the
way
its
fascicles
of
rigid
leaves
reminding
one
of
the
plumed
heads
of
indian
warriors
some
i
saw
with
edible
fruits
growing
in
clusters
like
bunches
of
bananas
several
species
are
there
of
these
yuccas
in
the
region
of
the
rio
grande
as
yet
unknown
to
the
scientific
botanist
i
observed
also
the
or
another
yucca
whose
roots
yield
an
excellent
substitute
for
soap
and
various
forms
of
cactus
never
out
of
sight
on
mexican
soil
grew
thickly
around
a
characteristic
feature
of
the
landscape
plants
of
humbler
stature
covered
the
surface
among
which
the
syngenesists
predominated
while
the
fetid
and
the
still
more
disagreeably
odorous
creosote
plant
grew
upon
spots
that
were
sandy
and
arid
pleasanter
objects
to
the
eye
were
the
scarlet
panicles
of
the
then
undescribed
by
botanists
and
yet
to
become
a
favourite
of
the
arboretums
i
was
in
no
mood
for
botanising
at
the
time
but
i
well
remember
how
i
admired
this
elegant
species
its
tall
stems
surmounted
by
panicles
of
brilliant
flowers
rising
high
above
the
level
of
the
surrounding
thicket
like
banners
above
a
host
not
that
i
possess
the
refined
taste
of
a
lover
of
flowers
and
much
less
then
but
cold
must
be
the
heart
that
could
look
upon
the
floral
beauty
of
mexico
without
remembering
some
portion
of
its
charms
even
the
rudest
of
my
followers
could
not
otherwise
than
admire
and
once
or
twice
as
we
journeyed
along
i
could
hear
them
give
utterance
to
that
fine
epithet
of
the
heart
desire
beautiful
as
we
advanced
the
aspect
changed
the
surface
became
freer
of
jungle
a
succession
of
glade
and
thicket
in
short
a
mezquite
prairie
still
advancing
the
openings
became
larger
while
the
timbered
surface
diminished
in
extent
and
now
and
then
the
glades
joined
each
other
without
interruption
we
had
ridden
nearly
ten
miles
without
drawing
bridle
when
our
guide
struck
upon
the
trail
of
the
manada
several
of
the
old
hunters
without
dismounting
pronounced
the
tracks
to
be
those
of
wild
which
they
easily
distinguished
from
tracks
their
judgment
proved
correct
for
following
the
trail
but
a
short
distance
farther
we
came
full
in
sight
of
the
drove
which
the
vaquero
confidently
pronounced
was
the
manada
we
were
in
search
of
so
far
our
success
equalled
our
expectations
but
to
get
sight
of
a
of
and
to
capture
its
swiftest
steed
are
two
things
of
very
unequal
difficulty
this
fact
my
anxiously
beating
heart
and
quickly
throbbing
pulse
revealed
to
me
at
the
moment
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
mingled
feelings
of
anxious
doubt
and
joyous
hope
that
passed
through
my
mind
as
from
afar
off
i
gazed
upon
that
shy
herd
still
unconscious
of
our
approach
the
prairie
upon
which
the
mares
were
browsing
was
more
then
a
mile
in
width
and
like
those
we
had
been
passing
through
it
was
surrounded
by
the
low
chapparal
forest
although
there
were
avenues
that
communicated
with
other
openings
of
a
similar
kind
near
its
centre
was
the
manada
some
of
the
mares
were
quietly
browsing
upon
the
grass
while
others
were
frisking
and
playing
about
now
rearing
up
as
if
in
combat
now
rushing
in
wild
gallop
their
tossed
manes
and
full
tails
flung
loosely
upon
the
wind
even
in
the
distance
we
could
trace
the
full
rounded
development
of
their
bodies
and
their
smooth
coats
glistening
under
the
sun
denoted
their
fair
condition
they
were
of
all
colours
known
to
the
horse
for
in
this
the
race
of
the
spanish
horse
is
somewhat
peculiar
there
were
bays
and
blacks
and
whites
the
last
being
most
numerous
there
were
greys
both
iron
and
roan
and
duns
with
white
manes
and
tails
and
some
of
a
mole
colour
and
not
a
few
of
the
kind
known
in
mexico
as
piebalds
for
spotted
horses
are
not
uncommon
among
the
mustangs
all
of
course
with
full
manes
and
tails
since
the
mutilating
shears
of
the
jockey
had
never
curtailed
their
flowing
glories
but
where
was
the
lord
of
this
splendid
harem
where
the
steed
this
was
the
thought
that
was
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
all
the
question
upon
every
tongue
our
eyes
wandered
over
the
herd
now
here
now
there
white
horses
there
were
numbers
of
them
but
it
needed
but
a
glance
to
tell
that
the
steed
of
the
prairies
was
not
there
we
eyed
each
other
with
looks
of
disappointment
even
my
companions
felt
that
but
a
far
more
bitter
feeling
was
growing
upon
me
as
i
gazed
upon
the
leaderless
troop
could
i
have
captured
and
carried
back
the
whole
drove
the
present
would
not
have
purchased
one
smile
from
isolina
the
steed
was
not
among
them
he
might
still
be
in
the
neighbourhood
or
had
he
forsaken
the
manada
altogether
and
gone
far
away
over
the
wide
prairie
in
search
of
new
conquests
the
vaquero
believed
he
was
not
far
off
i
had
faith
in
this
opinion
who
having
passed
his
life
in
the
observation
of
wild
and
horses
had
a
perfect
knowledge
of
their
habits
there
was
hope
then
the
steed
might
be
near
perhaps
lying
down
in
the
shade
of
the
thicket
perhaps
with
a
portion
of
the
manada
or
some
favourite
in
one
of
the
adjacent
glades
if
so
our
guide
assured
us
we
should
soon
have
him
in
view
he
would
soon
bring
the
steed
upon
the
ground
how
simply
by
startling
the
mares
whose
neigh
of
alarm
would
be
heard
from
afar
the
plan
seemed
feasible
enough
but
it
was
advisable
that
we
should
surround
the
manada
before
attempting
to
disturb
them
else
they
might
gallop
off
in
the
opposite
direction
before
any
of
us
could
get
near
without
delay
we
proceeded
to
effect
the
surround
the
chapparal
aided
us
by
concealing
our
movements
and
in
we
had
deployed
around
the
prairie
the
drove
still
browsed
and
played
they
had
no
suspicion
that
a
cordon
of
hunters
was
being
formed
around
them
else
they
would
have
long
since
galloped
away
of
all
wild
creatures
the
shyest
is
the
the
deer
the
antelope
and
buffalo
are
far
less
fearful
of
the
approach
of
man
the
mustang
seems
to
understand
the
doom
that
awaits
him
in
captivity
one
could
almost
fancy
that
the
runaways
from
the
settlements
occasionally
seen
amongst
them
had
poured
into
their
ears
the
tale
of
their
hardships
and
long
endurance
i
had
myself
ridden
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
prairie
in
order
to
be
certain
when
the
circle
was
complete
i
was
now
alone
having
dropped
my
companions
at
intervals
along
the
margin
of
the
timber
i
had
brought
with
me
the
bugle
with
a
note
or
two
of
which
i
intended
to
give
the
alarm
to
the
mares
i
had
placed
myself
in
a
clump
of
mezquite
trees
and
was
about
raising
the
horn
to
my
lips
when
a
shrill
scream
from
behind
caused
me
to
bring
down
the
instrument
and
turn
suddenly
in
my
seat
for
a
moment
i
was
in
doubt
as
to
what
could
have
produced
such
a
singular
utterance
when
a
second
time
it
fell
on
my
ear
and
then
i
recognised
it
it
was
the
neigh
of
the
prairie
stallion
near
me
was
a
break
in
the
thicket
a
sort
of
avenue
leading
out
into
another
prairie
in
this
i
could
hear
the
of
a
horse
going
at
a
gallop
as
fast
as
the
underwood
would
allow
i
pressed
forward
and
came
out
upon
the
edge
of
the
open
ground
but
the
sun
low
down
flashed
in
my
eyes
and
i
could
see
no
object
distinctly
the
tread
of
the
hoofs
and
the
shrill
neighing
still
rang
in
my
ears
presently
the
dazzling
light
no
longer
quite
blinded
me
i
shaded
my
eyes
with
my
hand
and
could
perceive
the
form
of
a
noble
steed
stretching
in
full
gallop
down
the
avenue
and
coming
in
the
direction
of
the
manada
springs
brought
him
opposite
the
beam
was
no
longer
in
my
eyes
and
as
he
galloped
past
i
saw
before
me
the
white
steed
of
the
prairies
there
was
no
mistaking
the
marks
of
that
splendid
creature
there
was
the
body
the
ears
of
jetty
blackness
the
blue
muzzle
the
red
projected
nostril
the
broad
oval
quarters
the
rounded
and
symmetric
limbs
all
the
points
of
an
incomparable
steed
like
an
arrow
he
shot
past
he
did
not
arrest
his
pace
for
an
instant
but
galloped
on
in
a
direct
line
for
the
drove
the
mares
had
answered
his
first
signal
with
a
responsive
neigh
and
tossing
up
their
heads
the
whole
manada
was
instantly
in
motion
in
a
few
seconds
they
stood
at
rest
again
in
as
exact
as
could
have
been
done
by
a
troop
of
cavalry
and
fronting
their
leader
as
he
galloped
up
indeed
standing
as
they
were
with
their
heads
high
in
air
it
was
easy
to
fancy
them
mounted
men
in
the
array
of
battle
and
often
have
been
mistaken
for
such
by
the
prairie
traveller
concealment
or
stratagem
could
no
longer
avail
the
chase
was
fairly
up
speed
and
the
lazo
must
now
decide
the
result
and
with
this
conviction
i
gave
moro
the
spur
and
bounded
into
the
open
plain
the
neighing
of
the
steed
had
signalled
my
companions
who
shot
almost
simultaneously
out
of
the
timber
and
spurred
towards
the
drove
yelling
as
they
came
i
had
no
eyes
for
aught
but
the
white
steed
and
after
him
i
directed
myself
on
nearing
the
line
of
mares
he
halted
in
his
wild
gallop
twice
reared
his
body
upward
as
if
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
and
then
uttering
another
of
his
shrill
screams
broke
off
in
a
direct
line
towards
the
edge
of
the
prairie
a
wide
avenue
leading
out
in
that
direction
seemed
to
have
guided
his
instincts
the
manada
followed
at
first
galloping
in
line
but
this
became
broken
as
the
swifter
individuals
passed
ahead
of
the
others
and
the
drove
were
soon
strung
out
upon
the
prairie
through
the
opening
now
swept
the
chase
the
pursuers
keenly
plying
the
spur
the
pursued
straining
every
muscle
to
escape
chapter
seventeen
the
hunt
of
the
my
gallant
horse
soon
gave
proof
of
his
superior
qualities
one
after
another
of
my
companions
was
passed
and
as
we
cleared
the
avenue
and
entered
a
second
prairie
i
found
myself
mixing
with
the
hindmost
of
the
mares
pretty
creatures
some
of
them
were
and
upon
any
other
occasion
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
fling
a
lazo
over
one
of
them
which
i
might
easily
have
done
then
i
only
thought
of
getting
them
out
of
the
way
as
they
were
hindering
my
onward
gallop
before
we
had
quite
crossed
the
second
prairie
i
had
forged
into
the
front
rank
and
the
mares
seeing
i
had
headed
them
broke
to
the
right
and
left
and
scattered
away
all
were
now
behind
me
all
but
the
white
steed
he
alone
kept
the
course
at
intervals
uttering
that
same
shrill
neigh
as
if
to
tantalise
and
lure
me
on
he
was
yet
far
in
advance
and
apparently
running
his
the
horse
i
bestrode
needed
neither
spur
nor
guidance
he
saw
before
him
the
object
of
the
chase
and
he
divined
the
will
of
his
rider
i
felt
him
rising
under
me
like
a
his
hoofs
struck
the
turf
without
impinging
upon
it
at
each
fresh
spring
he
came
up
with
elastic
rebound
while
his
flanks
heaved
with
the
conscious
possession
of
power
before
the
second
prairie
was
crossed
he
had
gained
considerably
upon
the
white
steed
but
to
my
chagrin
i
now
saw
the
latter
dash
right
into
the
thicket
i
found
a
path
and
followed
my
ear
served
to
guide
me
for
the
branches
crackled
as
the
broke
through
now
and
then
i
caught
glimpses
of
his
white
body
glancing
among
the
green
leaves
apprehensive
of
losing
him
i
rode
recklessly
after
now
breasting
the
thicket
now
tracing
its
labyrinthine
aisles
i
heeded
not
the
thorny
mimosas
my
horse
heeded
them
not
but
large
trees
of
the
false
acacia
stood
thickly
in
the
way
and
their
horizontal
branches
hindered
me
often
was
i
obliged
to
bend
flat
to
the
saddle
in
order
to
pass
under
them
all
this
was
in
favour
of
the
pursued
and
against
the
pursuer
i
longed
for
the
open
prairie
and
to
my
relief
it
at
length
appeared
not
yet
quite
treeless
but
studded
with
timber
islands
amid
these
the
white
steed
was
sailing
off
but
in
passing
through
the
thicket
he
had
gained
ground
and
was
now
a
long
way
in
advance
of
me
but
he
was
making
for
the
open
plain
that
lay
beyond
and
this
showed
that
it
was
his
habit
to
trust
to
his
heels
for
safety
perhaps
with
such
a
pursuer
he
would
have
been
safer
to
have
kept
the
chapparal
but
that
remained
to
be
seen
in
ten
minutes
time
we
had
passed
through
the
timber
islands
and
now
the
prairie
the
grand
limitless
prairie
stretched
bee
us
far
beyond
the
reach
of
vision
on
goes
the
chase
over
its
grassy
level
on
till
the
trees
are
no
longer
behind
us
and
the
eye
sees
nought
but
the
green
savannah
and
the
blue
canopy
arching
over
it
on
across
the
centre
of
that
vast
circle
which
has
for
its
boundary
the
whole
horizon
the
rangers
lost
in
the
mazes
of
the
chapparal
have
long
since
fallen
off
the
mustangs
have
gone
back
on
all
that
wide
plain
but
two
objects
appear
the
form
of
the
flying
steed
and
the
dark
horseman
that
follows
it
is
a
long
wild
ride
a
cruel
gallop
for
my
matchless
moro
ten
miles
of
the
prairie
have
we
passed
more
than
that
and
as
yet
i
have
neither
used
whip
nor
spur
the
brave
steed
needs
no
such
prompting
he
too
has
his
interest
in
the
chase
the
ambition
not
to
be
outrun
my
motive
is
different
i
think
only
of
the
smiles
of
a
woman
but
such
motive
ere
now
has
led
to
the
loss
of
a
crown
or
the
conquest
of
a
world
on
moro
on
you
must
overtake
him
or
die
there
is
no
longer
an
obstacle
he
can
not
hide
from
us
here
the
plain
with
its
sward
of
short
grass
is
level
and
smooth
as
the
sleeping
ocean
not
an
object
intrudes
upon
the
sight
he
can
not
conceal
himself
anywhere
there
is
still
an
hour
of
sunlight
he
can
not
hide
from
us
in
the
darkness
ere
that
comes
down
he
shall
be
our
captive
on
moro
on
on
we
glide
in
silence
the
steed
has
ceased
to
utter
his
taunting
neigh
he
has
lost
confidence
in
his
speed
he
now
runs
in
dread
never
before
has
he
been
so
sorely
pressed
he
runs
in
silence
and
so
too
his
pursuer
not
a
sound
is
heard
but
the
stroke
of
the
galloping
hoofs
an
impressive
silence
that
betokens
the
earnestness
of
the
chase
less
than
two
hundred
yards
separate
us
i
feel
certain
of
victory
a
touch
of
the
spur
would
now
bring
moro
within
range
it
is
time
to
put
an
end
to
this
desperate
ride
now
brave
moro
another
stretch
and
you
shall
have
rest
i
look
to
my
lazo
it
hangs
coiled
over
the
horn
of
my
saddle
one
end
is
fast
to
a
ring
and
staple
firmly
riveted
in
the
is
the
loop
clear
and
free
it
is
the
coil
is
it
straight
yes
all
as
it
should
be
i
lift
the
coil
and
rest
it
lightly
over
my
bridle
arm
i
separate
the
noose
and
hold
it
in
my
right
hand
i
am
ready
of
heaven
the
it
was
a
wild
exclamation
but
it
was
drawn
from
me
by
no
common
cause
in
arranging
my
lazo
i
had
taken
my
eyes
from
the
chase
only
for
a
moment
when
i
looked
out
again
horse
had
with
a
mechanical
movement
i
drew
bridle
almost
wrenching
my
horse
upon
his
haunches
indeed
the
animal
had
half
halted
of
his
own
accord
and
with
a
low
whimper
seemed
to
express
terror
what
could
it
mean
where
was
the
i
wheeled
round
and
round
again
scanning
the
prairie
on
every
side
though
a
single
glance
might
have
served
the
plain
as
already
described
was
level
as
a
table
the
horizon
bounded
the
view
there
was
neither
rock
nor
tree
nor
bush
nor
weed
nor
even
long
grass
the
sward
was
of
the
kind
known
upon
the
prairies
as
short
when
full
grown
but
then
rising
scarcely
two
inches
above
the
soil
a
serpent
could
hardly
have
found
concealment
under
it
but
a
horse
merciful
heaven
was
the
an
indefinable
feeling
of
awe
crept
over
me
i
trembled
i
felt
my
horse
trembling
between
my
thighs
he
was
covered
with
foam
and
sweat
so
was
i
the
effects
of
the
hard
ride
but
the
cold
perspiration
of
terror
was
fast
breaking
upon
me
the
mystery
was
heavy
and
appalling
chapter
eighteen
the
i
have
encountered
dangers
not
a
few
but
they
were
the
ordinary
perils
of
flood
and
field
and
i
understood
them
i
have
had
one
limb
broken
and
its
fellow
bored
with
an
ounce
of
lead
i
have
swum
from
a
sinking
ship
and
have
fallen
upon
the
i
have
looked
at
the
muzzles
of
a
hundred
muskets
aimed
at
my
person
at
less
than
thirty
yards
distance
and
felt
the
certainty
of
death
though
the
volley
was
fired
and
i
still
live
well
you
will
no
doubt
acknowledge
these
to
be
perils
do
not
mistake
me
i
am
not
boasting
of
having
encountered
them
i
met
them
with
more
or
less
courage
some
of
them
with
fear
but
if
the
fears
inspired
by
all
were
combined
into
one
emotion
of
terror
it
would
not
equal
in
intensity
that
which
i
experienced
at
the
moment
i
pulled
up
my
horse
upon
the
prairie
i
have
never
been
given
to
superstition
perhaps
my
religion
is
not
strong
enough
for
that
but
at
that
moment
i
could
not
help
yielding
to
a
full
belief
in
the
supernatural
there
was
no
cause
i
could
think
of
none
that
would
account
for
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
horse
i
had
often
sneered
at
the
credulous
sailor
and
his
had
i
lived
to
look
upon
a
phenomenon
equally
strange
yet
true
a
the
hunters
and
trappers
had
indeed
invested
the
white
steed
with
this
character
their
stories
recurred
to
my
memory
at
the
moment
i
had
used
to
smile
at
the
simple
credulity
of
the
narrators
i
was
now
prepared
to
believe
them
they
were
true
or
was
i
dreaming
was
it
not
all
a
dream
the
search
for
the
white
steed
the
surround
the
chase
the
long
long
gallop
for
some
moments
i
actually
fancied
that
such
be
the
case
but
soon
my
consciousness
became
clear
again
i
was
in
the
saddle
and
my
panting
smoking
steed
was
under
me
that
was
real
and
positive
i
remembered
all
the
incidents
of
the
chase
they
too
were
real
of
a
certainty
the
white
steed
had
been
there
he
was
gone
the
trappers
spoke
the
truth
the
horse
was
a
phantom
oppressed
with
this
thought
which
had
almost
become
a
conviction
i
sat
in
my
saddle
bent
and
silent
my
eyes
turned
upon
the
earth
but
their
gaze
fixed
on
vacuity
the
lazo
had
dropped
from
my
fingers
and
the
trailed
untouched
over
the
withers
of
my
horse
my
belief
in
the
supernatural
was
of
short
duration
how
long
i
know
not
for
during
its
continuance
i
remained
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
my
senses
at
length
returned
my
eyes
had
fallen
upon
a
fresh
on
the
turf
directly
in
front
of
me
i
knew
it
was
that
made
by
the
white
steed
and
this
awoke
me
to
a
process
of
reasoning
had
the
horse
been
a
phantom
he
could
not
have
made
a
track
i
had
never
heard
of
the
track
of
a
ghost
though
a
might
be
different
from
the
common
kind
my
reflections
on
this
head
ended
in
the
determination
to
follow
the
trail
as
far
as
it
should
lead
of
course
to
the
point
where
the
steed
must
have
mounted
into
the
air
or
evaporated
the
scene
of
his
apotheosis
with
this
resolve
i
gathered
my
reins
and
rode
forward
upon
the
trail
keeping
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
the
line
was
direct
and
i
had
ridden
nearly
two
hundred
yards
when
my
horse
came
to
a
sudden
stop
i
looked
out
forward
to
discover
the
cause
of
his
halting
with
that
glance
vanished
my
superstitions
at
the
distance
of
some
thirty
paces
a
dark
line
was
seen
upon
the
prairie
running
transversely
to
the
course
i
was
following
it
appeared
to
be
a
narrow
crack
in
the
plain
but
on
spurring
nearer
it
proved
to
be
a
fissure
of
considerable
width
one
of
those
formations
known
throughout
spanish
america
as
the
earth
yawned
as
though
rent
by
an
earthquake
but
water
had
evidently
something
to
do
with
the
formation
of
the
chasm
it
was
of
nearly
equal
width
at
top
and
bottom
and
its
bed
was
covered
with
a
of
rocks
rounded
by
attrition
its
sides
were
perfectly
vertical
and
the
stratification
even
to
the
exactly
corresponded
thus
rendering
it
invisible
at
the
distance
of
but
a
few
paces
from
its
brink
it
appeared
to
shallow
to
the
right
and
no
doubt
ended
not
far
off
in
that
direction
towards
the
left
on
the
contrary
i
could
see
that
it
became
deeper
and
wider
at
the
point
where
i
had
reached
it
its
bottom
was
nearly
twenty
feet
from
the
surface
of
the
prairie
of
course
the
disappearance
of
the
white
steed
was
no
longer
a
mystery
he
had
made
a
fearful
leap
nearly
twenty
feet
sheer
there
was
the
torn
turf
on
the
brink
of
the
chasm
and
the
displacement
of
the
loose
stones
where
he
had
bounded
into
its
bed
he
had
gone
to
the
left
down
the
barranca
the
abrasion
of
his
hoofs
was
visible
upon
the
rocks
i
looked
down
the
defile
he
was
not
to
be
seen
the
barranca
turned
off
by
an
angle
at
no
great
distance
he
had
already
passed
round
the
angle
and
was
out
of
sight
it
was
clear
that
he
had
escaped
that
to
fellow
would
be
of
no
use
and
with
this
reflection
i
abandoned
all
thoughts
of
carrying
the
chase
farther
after
giving
way
to
a
pang
or
two
of
disappointment
i
began
to
think
of
the
position
in
which
i
had
placed
myself
it
is
true
i
was
now
relieved
from
the
feeling
of
awe
that
but
a
moment
before
had
oppressed
me
but
my
situation
was
far
from
being
a
pleasant
one
i
was
at
least
thirty
miles
from
the
rancheria
and
i
could
not
tell
in
what
direction
it
lay
the
sun
was
setting
and
therefore
i
had
the
points
of
the
compass
but
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
whether
we
had
ridden
eastward
or
westward
after
leaving
the
settlements
i
might
ride
back
on
my
own
trail
i
might
it
was
a
doubtful
point
neither
through
the
timber
nor
on
the
open
prairie
had
the
chase
gone
in
a
direct
line
moreover
i
noticed
in
many
places
as
we
glided
swiftly
along
that
the
turf
was
cut
up
by
numerous
droves
of
mustangs
had
passed
over
the
ground
it
would
be
no
easy
matter
for
me
to
retrace
the
windings
of
that
long
gallop
one
thing
was
evident
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
make
the
attempt
before
morning
there
was
not
of
sun
left
and
at
night
the
trail
could
not
be
followed
i
had
no
alternative
but
to
remain
where
i
was
until
another
day
should
break
but
how
remain
i
was
hungry
still
worse
i
was
choking
with
thirst
not
a
drop
of
water
was
near
i
had
seen
none
for
twenty
miles
the
long
hot
ride
had
made
me
thirsty
to
an
unusual
degree
and
my
poor
horse
was
in
a
similar
condition
the
knowledge
that
no
water
was
near
added
as
it
always
does
to
the
agony
and
rendered
the
physical
want
more
difficult
to
be
endured
i
scanned
the
bottom
of
the
barranca
and
tracked
it
with
my
eye
as
far
as
i
could
see
it
was
waterless
as
the
lain
itself
the
rocks
rested
upon
dry
sand
and
gravel
not
a
drop
of
the
element
appeared
within
its
bed
although
it
was
evident
that
at
some
time
a
torrent
must
have
swept
along
its
channel
after
some
reflection
it
occurred
to
me
that
by
following
the
barranca
i
might
find
water
at
least
this
was
the
most
likely
direction
in
which
to
search
for
it
i
rode
forward
therefore
directing
my
horse
along
the
edge
of
the
chasm
the
fissure
deepened
as
i
advanced
until
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
from
where
i
first
struck
it
the
gulf
yawned
full
fifty
feet
into
the
plain
the
sides
still
preserving
their
vertical
steepness
the
sun
had
now
gone
down
the
twilight
promised
to
be
a
short
one
i
dared
not
traverse
that
plain
in
the
darkness
i
might
ride
over
the
precipitous
edge
of
the
barranca
besides
it
was
not
the
only
one
i
saw
there
were
others
smaller
ones
the
beds
of
tributary
streams
in
seasons
of
rain
these
branched
off
diagonally
or
at
right
angles
and
were
more
or
less
deep
and
steep
night
was
fast
closing
over
the
prairie
i
dared
not
ride
farther
amid
these
perilous
abysms
i
must
soon
come
to
a
halt
without
finding
water
i
should
have
to
spend
the
long
hours
without
relief
the
prospect
of
such
a
night
was
fearful
i
was
still
riding
slowly
onward
mechanically
conducting
my
horse
when
a
bright
object
fell
under
my
eyes
causing
me
to
start
in
my
saddle
with
an
exclamation
of
joy
it
was
the
gleam
of
water
i
saw
it
in
a
westerly
direction
the
direction
in
which
i
was
going
it
proved
to
be
a
small
lake
or
in
the
phraseology
of
the
country
a
pond
it
was
not
in
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
where
i
had
hitherto
been
looking
for
water
but
up
on
the
high
prairie
there
was
no
timber
around
it
no
sedge
its
shores
were
without
vegetation
of
any
kind
and
its
surface
appeared
to
correspond
with
the
level
of
the
plain
itself
i
rode
towards
it
with
joyful
anticipation
yet
not
without
some
anxiety
was
it
a
it
might
be
often
had
i
been
deceived
by
such
appearances
but
no
it
had
not
the
filmy
halo
that
hangs
over
the
mirage
its
outlines
were
sharply
defined
by
the
prairie
turf
and
the
last
lingering
rays
of
the
sun
glistened
upon
its
surface
it
water
fully
assured
of
this
i
rode
forward
at
a
more
rapid
rate
i
had
arrived
within
about
two
hundred
paces
of
the
spot
still
keeping
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
glistening
water
when
all
at
once
my
horse
started
and
drew
back
i
looked
ahead
to
discover
the
cause
the
twilight
had
nearly
passed
but
in
the
obscurity
i
could
still
distinguish
the
surface
of
the
prairie
the
barranca
again
frowned
before
me
running
transversely
across
my
path
to
my
chagrin
i
perceived
that
the
chasm
had
made
a
sudden
turn
and
that
the
pond
was
on
its
chapter
nineteen
a
prairie
dream
there
was
no
hope
of
crossing
in
the
darkness
the
barranca
was
here
deeper
than
at
any
point
above
so
deep
that
i
could
but
indistinctly
see
the
rocky
boulders
at
its
bottom
perhaps
with
the
daylight
i
might
be
able
to
find
a
but
from
that
doubtful
hypothesis
i
derived
little
consolation
it
had
now
grown
quite
dark
and
i
had
no
choice
but
to
pass
the
night
where
i
was
though
i
anticipated
a
night
of
torture
i
dropped
to
the
ground
and
having
led
my
horse
a
few
rods
into
the
prairie
so
as
to
keep
him
clear
of
the
precipice
i
relieved
him
of
his
saddle
and
bridle
and
left
him
to
browse
to
the
full
length
of
the
lazo
for
myself
i
had
but
few
preparations
to
make
there
was
no
supper
to
be
cooked
but
eating
was
a
matter
of
secondary
importance
on
that
occasion
i
should
have
preferred
a
cup
of
water
to
a
roast
turkey
i
had
but
few
implements
to
dispose
of
in
my
temporary
camp
only
my
rifle
and
with
horn
and
pouch
and
the
gourd
which
served
as
and
which
alas
had
been
emptied
at
an
early
hour
of
the
day
fortunately
my
mexican
blanket
was
buckled
to
the
croupe
this
i
unstrapped
and
having
enveloped
myself
in
its
ample
folds
and
placed
my
head
in
the
hollow
of
my
saddle
i
composed
myself
as
well
as
i
could
in
the
hope
of
falling
asleep
for
a
long
time
this
luxury
was
denied
me
the
torture
of
thirst
will
rob
one
of
sleep
as
effectually
as
the
stinging
pain
of
toothache
i
turned
and
turned
again
glaring
at
the
moon
she
was
visible
only
at
intervals
as
black
clouds
were
coursing
across
the
canopy
but
when
she
shone
out
her
light
caused
the
little
lake
to
glisten
like
a
sheet
of
silver
oh
how
that
bright
water
mocked
me
with
its
wavy
ripple
i
could
comprehend
the
sufferings
of
tantalus
i
thought
at
the
time
that
the
gods
could
not
have
devised
a
more
exquisite
torture
for
the
royal
lydian
after
some
time
the
pain
of
thirst
was
less
intensely
felt
perhaps
the
cold
damp
air
of
night
had
the
effect
of
relieving
it
but
it
is
more
likely
that
fatigue
and
long
endurance
had
rendered
the
sense
less
acute
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
i
suffered
less
and
felt
myself
yielding
to
sleep
there
was
no
sound
to
keep
me
awake
perfect
stillness
reigned
around
even
the
usual
howling
bark
of
the
did
not
reach
my
ear
the
place
seemed
too
lonely
for
this
almost
ubiquitous
the
only
sign
of
life
that
told
me
i
was
not
alone
was
the
occasional
stroke
of
my
steed
hoof
upon
the
hard
turf
and
the
crop
crop
that
told
me
he
was
busy
with
the
short
but
these
were
soothing
sounds
as
they
admonished
me
that
my
faithful
companion
was
enjoying
himself
after
his
hard
gallop
and
strengthened
my
desire
for
repose
i
slept
but
not
lightly
no
my
sleep
was
heavy
and
full
of
troubled
dreams
i
have
a
sort
of
half
belief
that
the
we
play
in
these
wears
the
body
as
much
as
if
we
enacted
it
in
reality
i
have
often
awaked
from
such
visions
feeble
from
fatigue
if
such
be
the
fact
during
that
night
upon
the
prairie
i
went
through
the
toils
of
the
preceding
day
with
considerable
additions
first
of
all
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
lovely
woman
she
was
a
brunette
a
beauty
i
traced
the
features
of
isolina
i
gazed
into
her
eyes
i
was
happy
in
her
smiles
i
fancied
i
was
beloved
bright
objects
were
around
me
the
whole
scene
was
this
was
a
short
episode
it
was
interrupted
i
heard
shouts
and
savage
yells
i
looked
out
the
house
was
surrounded
by
indians
they
were
already
within
the
enclosure
and
the
moment
after
crowds
of
them
entered
the
house
there
was
much
struggling
and
confusion
battled
with
such
arms
as
i
could
lay
hold
of
several
fell
before
me
but
one
a
tall
savage
the
chief
as
i
thought
threw
his
arms
around
my
mistress
and
carried
her
away
out
of
my
sight
i
remember
not
how
i
got
mounted
but
i
was
upon
horseback
and
galloping
over
the
wide
prairie
in
pursuit
of
the
ravisher
i
could
see
the
savage
ahead
upon
a
steed
with
isolina
in
his
arms
i
urged
my
horse
with
voice
and
spur
but
as
i
thought
for
long
long
hours
in
vain
the
white
steed
still
kept
far
in
advance
and
i
could
get
no
nearer
to
him
i
thought
the
savage
had
changed
his
form
he
was
no
longer
an
indian
chief
but
the
fiend
himself
i
saw
the
horns
upon
his
head
his
feet
were
cloven
hoofs
i
thought
he
was
luring
me
to
the
brink
of
some
fell
precipice
and
i
had
no
longer
the
power
to
stay
my
horse
ha
the
demon
and
his
have
gone
over
the
cliff
they
have
carried
her
along
with
them
i
must
follow
i
can
not
remain
behind
i
am
on
the
brink
my
steed
springs
over
the
chasm
i
am
falling
falling
falling
i
reach
the
rocks
at
length
i
am
not
killed
how
strange
it
is
i
have
not
been
crushed
but
no
i
still
live
and
yet
i
suffer
thirst
chokes
and
tortures
me
my
heart
and
brain
are
aching
and
my
tongue
is
on
fire
the
sound
of
water
is
in
my
ears
a
torrent
rushes
by
near
me
if
i
could
only
reach
it
i
might
drink
and
live
but
i
can
not
move
i
am
chained
to
the
rocks
i
grasp
one
after
another
and
endeavour
to
drag
myself
along
i
partially
succeed
but
oh
what
efforts
i
make
the
labour
exhausts
my
strength
i
renew
my
exertions
i
am
gaining
ground
rock
after
rock
is
passed
i
have
neared
the
rushing
water
i
feel
its
cold
spray
sprinkling
me
i
am
saved
after
such
fashion
was
my
dream
it
was
the
shadow
of
a
reality
somewhat
disorganised
but
the
most
pleasant
reality
was
that
which
awoke
me
i
found
myself
in
the
act
of
being
sprinkled
not
by
the
spray
of
a
torrent
but
by
a
plashing
shower
from
the
clouds
under
other
circumstances
this
might
have
been
less
welcome
but
now
i
hailed
it
with
a
shout
of
joy
the
thunder
was
rolling
almost
continuously
lightning
blazed
at
short
intervals
and
i
could
hear
the
roar
of
a
torrent
passing
down
the
barranca
to
assuage
thirst
was
my
first
thought
and
for
this
purpose
i
stretched
out
my
concave
palms
and
held
my
mouth
wide
open
thus
drinking
from
the
very
fountains
of
the
sky
though
the
drops
fell
thick
and
heavy
the
process
was
too
slow
and
a
better
plan
suggested
itself
i
knew
that
my
was
it
was
one
of
the
best
of
parras
fabric
and
had
cost
me
a
hundred
silver
dollars
this
i
spread
to
its
full
extent
pressing
the
central
parts
into
a
hollow
of
the
prairie
in
five
minutes
time
i
had
forgotten
what
thirst
was
and
wondered
how
such
a
thing
should
have
caused
me
so
much
torture
moro
drank
from
the
same
trough
and
betook
himself
to
the
grass
again
the
under
side
of
the
blanket
was
still
dry
and
the
patch
of
ground
which
it
had
sheltered
along
this
i
stretched
myself
drew
the
serape
over
me
and
after
listening
a
while
to
the
loud
lullaby
of
the
thunder
fell
fast
asleep
chapter
twenty
lost
upon
the
prairie
i
slept
sweetly
and
soundly
i
had
no
dreams
or
only
such
as
were
light
and
forgotten
with
the
return
of
consciousness
it
was
late
when
i
awoke
a
bright
sun
was
mounting
into
the
blue
and
cloudless
sky
this
orb
was
already
many
degrees
above
the
horizon
hunger
was
the
father
of
my
first
thought
i
had
eaten
nothing
since
an
early
hour
of
the
preceding
day
and
then
only
the
light
of
and
chocolate
to
one
not
accustomed
to
long
fasting
a
single
day
without
food
will
give
some
idea
of
the
pain
of
hunger
that
pain
will
increase
upon
a
second
day
and
by
the
third
will
have
reached
its
maximum
upon
the
fourth
and
fifth
the
body
grows
weaker
and
the
brain
becomes
deranged
the
nerve
however
is
less
acute
and
though
the
suffering
is
still
intense
hunger
is
never
harder
to
endure
than
upon
the
second
or
third
days
of
course
these
remarks
apply
only
to
those
not
habituated
to
long
fasts
i
have
known
men
who
could
endure
hunger
for
six
days
and
feel
less
pain
than
others
under
a
fast
of
hours
indians
or
were
those
men
and
fortunately
for
them
that
they
are
endowed
with
such
powers
of
endurance
often
driven
as
they
are
into
circumstances
of
the
most
dire
necessity
truly
the
lord
tempers
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
as
i
have
said
my
first
thought
was
of
something
to
eat
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
with
my
eye
swept
the
prairie
in
every
direction
no
object
living
or
dead
greeted
my
sight
beast
or
bird
there
was
none
my
horse
alone
met
my
glance
quietly
browsing
on
his
i
could
not
help
envying
him
as
i
scanned
his
sides
i
thought
of
the
bounty
of
the
creator
in
thus
providing
for
his
less
intelligent
creatures
giving
them
the
power
to
live
where
man
would
starve
who
does
not
in
this
recognise
the
hand
of
a
providence
i
walked
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
barranca
and
looked
over
it
was
a
grim
abyss
over
a
hundred
feet
in
depth
and
about
the
same
in
width
its
sides
were
less
precipitous
at
this
point
the
escarpment
rocks
had
fallen
in
and
formed
a
sort
of
shelving
bank
by
which
a
man
on
foot
might
have
descended
into
its
bed
and
climbed
out
on
the
opposite
side
but
it
was
not
passable
for
a
horse
its
cliffs
were
furrowed
and
uneven
rocks
jutted
out
and
hung
over
and
in
the
seams
grew
cactus
plants
bramble
and
small
trees
of
dwarf
cedar
i
looked
into
its
channel
i
had
heard
the
torrent
rolling
down
in
the
night
i
saw
traces
of
the
water
among
the
rocks
a
large
body
must
have
passed
and
yet
not
a
cupful
could
now
have
been
lifted
from
its
bed
what
remained
was
fast
filtering
into
the
sand
or
rising
back
to
the
heavens
upon
the
heated
atmosphere
i
had
brought
with
me
my
rifle
in
hopes
of
espying
some
living
creature
but
after
walking
for
a
considerable
distance
along
the
edge
i
abandoned
the
search
no
trace
of
bird
or
quadruped
could
be
found
and
i
turned
and
went
back
to
the
place
where
i
had
slept
to
draw
the
of
my
horse
and
saddle
him
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
this
done
i
began
to
bethink
me
of
i
was
back
to
the
rancheria
of
course
that
was
the
natural
reply
to
such
a
question
but
there
was
another
far
less
easily
answered
how
was
i
to
find
the
way
my
design
of
the
previous
night
to
follow
back
my
own
trail
was
no
longer
practicable
rain
had
effaced
the
i
remembered
that
i
had
passed
over
wide
stretches
of
light
dusty
soil
where
the
hoof
scarcely
impressed
itself
i
remembered
that
the
rain
had
been
of
that
character
known
as
planet
showers
with
large
heavy
drops
that
in
such
places
must
have
blotted
out
every
trace
of
the
trail
to
follow
the
was
no
longer
possible
i
had
not
before
thought
of
this
difficulty
and
now
that
it
presented
itself
to
my
mind
it
was
accompanied
by
a
new
feeling
of
dread
i
felt
that
was
as
you
sit
in
your
you
may
fancy
that
this
is
a
mere
bagatelle
a
little
bewilderment
that
one
may
easily
escape
from
who
has
a
good
horse
between
his
thighs
it
is
only
to
strike
boldly
out
and
by
riding
on
a
straight
you
must
in
time
arrive
no
doubt
that
is
your
idea
but
permit
me
to
inform
you
that
the
success
of
such
a
course
depends
very
much
upon
circumstances
it
would
indeed
be
trusting
to
blind
chance
you
might
arrive
somewhere
and
that
somewhere
might
be
the
very
point
from
which
you
had
started
do
you
fancy
you
can
ride
ten
miles
in
a
direct
line
over
a
prairie
without
a
single
object
to
guide
you
be
undeceived
then
you
can
not
the
best
mounted
men
have
perished
under
such
circumstances
it
may
take
days
to
escape
out
of
a
prairie
and
days
bring
death
hunger
and
thirst
soon
gain
strength
and
agony
the
sooner
that
you
know
you
have
not
the
wherewith
to
satisfy
the
one
nor
quench
the
other
besides
there
is
in
your
very
loneliness
a
feeling
of
bewilderment
painful
to
an
extreme
degree
and
from
which
only
the
oldest
are
free
your
senses
lose
half
their
power
your
energy
is
diminished
and
your
resolves
become
weak
and
vacillating
you
feel
doubtful
at
each
step
as
to
whether
you
be
following
the
right
path
and
are
ready
at
every
moment
to
turn
into
another
believe
me
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
be
alone
when
lost
upon
the
prairies
i
felt
this
keenly
enough
i
had
been
on
the
great
plains
before
but
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
the
misfortune
to
wander
astray
on
them
and
i
was
the
more
terrified
that
i
already
hungered
to
no
common
degree
there
was
something
singular
too
in
the
circumstances
that
had
brought
me
into
my
present
situation
the
disappearance
of
the
white
steed
although
accounted
for
by
perfectly
natural
causes
had
left
upon
my
mind
a
strange
impression
that
he
should
have
lured
me
so
far
and
then
eluded
me
in
such
a
way
i
could
not
help
fancying
design
in
it
and
fancying
so
i
could
attribute
such
design
only
to
a
higher
intelligence
in
fact
to
some
supernatural
cause
i
was
again
on
the
edge
of
superstition
my
mind
began
to
give
way
and
yield
itself
to
hideous
fancies
i
struggled
against
such
thoughts
and
succeeded
in
rousing
myself
to
reflect
upon
some
active
measures
for
my
safety
i
saw
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
remain
where
i
was
i
knew
that
i
could
make
a
straight
path
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
least
the
sun
was
in
the
sky
and
that
would
guide
me
until
near
the
meridian
hours
then
i
should
have
to
halt
and
wait
a
while
for
in
that
southern
latitude
and
just
at
that
time
of
the
year
the
sun
at
noon
is
so
near
the
zenith
that
a
practised
astronomer
could
not
tell
north
from
south
i
reflected
that
before
noon
i
might
reach
the
timber
though
that
would
not
insure
my
safety
even
the
naked
plain
is
not
more
bewildering
than
the
openings
of
the
mezquite
groves
and
the
chapparal
that
border
it
among
these
you
may
travel
for
days
without
getting
twenty
miles
from
your
and
they
are
often
as
destitute
of
the
means
of
life
as
the
desert
itself
such
were
my
reflections
as
i
had
saddled
and
bridled
my
horse
and
stood
scanning
the
plain
in
order
to
make
up
my
mind
as
to
the
direction
i
should
take
chapter
twenty
one
a
prairie
repast
in
gazing
out
my
eye
was
attracted
by
some
objects
they
were
animals
but
of
what
species
i
could
not
tell
there
are
times
upon
the
prairies
when
form
and
size
present
the
most
illusory
aspects
a
wolf
seems
as
large
as
a
horse
and
a
raven
sitting
upon
a
swell
of
the
plain
has
been
mistaken
for
a
buffalo
a
peculiar
state
of
the
atmosphere
is
the
magnifying
cause
and
it
is
only
the
experienced
eye
of
the
trapper
that
can
reduce
the
magnified
proportions
and
distorted
form
to
their
proper
size
and
shape
the
objects
i
had
noticed
were
full
two
miles
off
they
were
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
and
of
course
on
the
other
side
of
the
barranca
there
were
several
forms
five
i
counted
moving
against
the
rim
of
the
horizon
something
drew
my
attention
from
them
for
a
short
while
a
period
of
perhaps
three
or
four
minutes
duration
when
i
looked
out
again
they
were
no
longer
to
be
seen
but
by
the
edge
of
the
pond
at
less
than
five
hundred
yards
distance
five
beautiful
creatures
were
standing
which
i
knew
to
be
antelopes
they
were
so
close
to
the
pond
that
their
graceful
forms
were
shadowed
in
the
water
and
their
erect
attitudes
told
that
they
had
just
halted
after
a
run
their
number
corresponded
with
the
objects
i
had
seen
but
the
moment
before
far
out
upon
the
prairie
i
was
convinced
they
were
the
same
the
distance
was
nothing
these
creatures
travel
with
the
speed
of
a
swallow
the
sight
of
the
stimulated
my
hunger
my
first
thought
was
how
to
get
near
them
curiosity
had
brought
them
to
the
pond
they
had
espied
my
horse
and
myself
afar
off
and
had
galloped
up
to
reconnoitre
us
but
they
still
appeared
shy
and
timid
and
were
evidently
not
inclined
to
approach
nearer
the
barranca
lay
between
them
and
me
but
i
saw
that
if
i
could
entice
them
to
its
brink
they
would
be
within
range
of
my
rifle
once
more
staking
down
my
horse
i
tried
every
plan
i
could
think
of
i
laid
myself
along
the
grass
upon
my
back
and
kicked
my
heels
in
the
air
but
to
no
purpose
the
game
would
not
move
from
the
water
edge
remembering
that
my
serape
was
of
very
brilliant
colours
i
bethought
me
of
another
plan
which
when
adroitly
practised
rarely
fails
of
success
taking
the
blanket
i
lashed
one
edge
to
the
ramrod
of
my
rifle
having
first
passed
the
latter
through
the
upper
swivel
of
the
piece
with
the
thumb
of
my
left
hand
i
was
thus
enabled
to
hold
the
rammer
steady
and
transverse
to
the
barrel
i
now
dropped
upon
my
knees
holding
the
gun
and
the
serape
spread
out
almost
to
its
full
extent
hung
to
the
ground
and
formed
a
complete
cover
for
my
person
before
making
these
arrangements
i
had
crept
to
the
very
edge
of
the
barranca
in
order
to
be
as
near
as
possible
should
the
antelopes
approach
upon
the
opposite
side
of
course
every
manoeuvre
was
executed
with
all
the
silence
and
caution
i
could
observe
i
was
in
no
reckless
humour
to
frighten
off
the
game
hunger
was
my
monitor
i
knew
that
not
my
breakfast
alone
but
my
life
might
be
depending
on
the
successful
issue
of
the
experiment
it
was
not
long
before
i
had
the
gratification
of
perceiving
that
my
decoy
was
likely
to
prove
attractive
the
antelope
like
most
animals
of
its
kind
has
one
strongly
developed
propensity
that
of
although
to
a
known
enemy
it
is
the
most
timid
of
creatures
yet
in
the
presence
of
an
object
that
is
new
to
it
it
appears
to
throw
aside
its
timidity
or
rather
its
curiosity
overcomes
its
sense
of
fear
and
impelled
by
the
former
it
will
approach
very
near
to
any
strange
form
and
regard
it
with
an
air
of
bewilderment
the
a
creature
that
surpasses
even
the
fox
in
cunning
well
knows
this
weakness
of
the
antelope
and
often
takes
advantage
of
it
the
wolf
is
less
fleet
than
the
antelope
and
his
pursuit
of
it
in
a
direct
manner
would
be
vain
but
with
the
astute
creature
stratagem
makes
up
for
the
absence
of
speed
should
a
band
of
antelopes
chance
to
be
passing
the
lays
himself
flat
upon
the
grass
clews
his
body
into
a
round
ball
and
thus
rolls
himself
over
the
ground
or
goes
through
a
series
of
contortions
all
the
while
approaching
nearer
to
his
victims
until
he
has
them
within
springing
distance
usually
he
is
assisted
in
these
manoeuvres
by
several
companions
for
the
is
social
and
hunts
in
packs
the
square
of
bright
colours
soon
produced
its
effect
the
five
came
trotting
around
the
edge
of
the
lake
halted
gazed
upon
it
a
moment
and
then
dashed
off
again
to
a
greater
distance
soon
however
they
turned
and
came
running
back
this
time
apparently
with
greater
confidence
and
a
stronger
feeling
of
curiosity
i
could
hear
them
uttering
their
quick
snorts
as
they
tossed
up
their
tiny
muzzles
and
snuffed
the
air
fortunately
the
wind
was
in
my
favour
blowing
directly
from
the
game
and
towards
me
otherwise
they
would
have
winded
me
and
discovered
the
cheat
for
they
both
know
and
fear
the
scent
of
the
human
hunter
the
band
consisted
of
a
young
buck
and
four
females
his
wives
the
nucleus
no
doubt
of
a
much
larger
establishment
in
prospect
for
the
antelope
is
polygamous
and
some
of
the
older
males
have
an
extensive
following
i
knew
the
buck
by
his
greater
size
and
forking
horns
which
the
does
want
he
appeared
to
direct
the
actions
of
the
others
as
they
all
stood
in
a
line
behind
him
following
and
imitating
his
motions
at
the
second
approach
they
came
within
a
hundred
yards
of
me
my
rifle
was
equal
to
this
range
and
i
prepared
to
fire
the
leader
was
nearest
and
him
i
selected
as
the
victim
taking
sight
i
pulled
trigger
as
soon
as
the
smoke
cleared
off
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
buck
down
upon
the
prairie
in
the
act
of
giving
his
last
kick
to
my
surprise
none
of
the
others
had
been
frightened
off
by
the
report
but
stood
gazing
at
their
fallen
leader
apparently
bewildered
i
bethought
me
of
reloading
but
i
had
incautiously
risen
to
my
feet
and
so
revealed
my
form
to
the
eyes
of
the
antelopes
this
produced
an
effect
which
neither
the
crack
of
the
rifle
nor
the
fall
of
their
comrade
had
done
and
the
now
terrified
animals
wheeled
about
and
sped
away
like
the
wind
in
less
than
two
minutes
they
were
beyond
the
reach
of
vision
the
next
question
that
arose
was
how
i
was
to
get
across
the
barranca
the
tempting
morsel
lay
upon
the
other
side
and
i
therefore
set
about
examining
the
chasm
in
order
to
find
a
practicable
crossing
this
i
fortunately
discovered
on
both
sides
the
cliff
was
somewhat
broken
down
and
might
be
scaled
though
not
without
considerable
difficulty
after
once
more
looking
to
the
security
of
my
horse
i
placed
my
rifle
where
i
had
slept
and
set
out
to
cross
the
barranca
taking
only
my
knife
i
could
have
no
use
for
the
gun
and
it
would
hinder
me
in
scaling
the
cliffs
i
succeeded
in
reaching
to
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
and
commenced
ascending
on
the
opposite
side
where
it
was
steeper
but
i
was
assisted
by
the
branches
of
the
trailing
cedar
that
grew
among
the
rocks
i
noticed
and
with
some
surprise
that
the
path
must
have
been
used
before
either
by
men
or
animals
the
soil
that
laid
upon
the
ledges
was
paddled
as
by
feet
and
the
rock
in
some
places
scratched
and
discoloured
these
indications
only
caused
me
a
momentary
reflection
i
was
too
hungry
to
dwell
upon
any
thought
but
that
of
eating
at
length
i
reached
the
scarp
of
the
cliff
and
having
climbed
out
upon
the
prairie
soon
stood
over
the
carcass
of
the
my
knife
was
out
in
a
trice
and
next
moment
i
was
playing
the
part
of
the
butcher
you
will
no
doubt
fancy
that
the
next
thing
i
did
was
to
go
in
search
of
something
to
make
a
fire
for
the
purpose
of
cooking
my
breakfast
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
ate
my
breakfast
without
cooking
ate
it
and
you
been
in
my
situation
delicate
as
you
are
you
would
have
done
the
same
it
is
true
that
after
i
had
satisfied
the
first
cravings
of
appetite
with
the
tongue
of
the
antelope
and
a
few
morsels
of
steak
i
became
more
fastidious
and
thought
a
little
roasting
might
improve
the
venison
for
this
purpose
i
was
about
to
return
to
the
barranca
in
order
to
gather
some
sticks
of
when
my
eyes
fell
upon
an
object
that
drove
all
thoughts
of
cookery
out
of
my
head
and
sent
a
thrill
of
terror
to
my
heart
chapter
twenty
two
chased
by
a
grizzly
the
object
that
inspired
me
with
such
alarm
was
an
animal
the
most
dreaded
of
all
that
inhabit
the
prairies
the
this
bear
was
one
of
the
largest
but
it
was
not
his
size
that
impressed
me
with
fear
so
much
as
the
knowledge
of
his
fierce
nature
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
encountered
the
grizzly
bear
and
i
knew
his
habits
well
i
was
familiar
with
the
form
and
aspect
and
could
not
be
mistaken
as
to
the
species
the
long
shaggy
pelage
the
straight
front
and
broad
facial
disk
which
distinguishes
this
species
from
the
the
yellowish
eyes
the
large
teeth
but
half
concealed
by
the
lips
and
above
all
the
long
curving
claws
the
most
prominent
marks
of
the
grizzly
bear
as
they
are
his
most
formidable
means
of
attack
were
all
easily
identified
when
my
eyes
first
rested
upon
the
brute
he
was
just
emerging
out
of
the
barranca
at
the
very
spot
where
i
had
climbed
up
myself
it
was
tracks
then
i
had
observed
while
scaling
the
cliff
on
reaching
the
level
of
the
prairie
he
advanced
a
pace
or
two
and
then
halting
reared
himself
erect
and
stood
upon
his
at
the
same
time
he
uttered
a
snorting
sound
which
resembled
the
blowing
of
hogs
when
suddenly
startled
in
the
forest
for
some
moments
he
remained
in
this
upright
attitude
rubbing
his
head
with
his
and
playing
his
huge
arms
about
after
the
manner
of
monkeys
in
fact
as
he
stood
fronting
me
he
looked
not
unlike
a
gigantic
ape
and
his
colour
favoured
a
resemblance
to
the
great
ourang
when
i
say
that
i
was
terrified
by
the
presence
of
this
unwelcome
intruder
i
speak
no
more
than
truth
had
i
been
on
horseback
i
should
have
regarded
the
creature
no
more
than
the
snail
that
crawled
upon
the
grass
the
grizzly
bear
is
too
slow
to
overtake
a
horse
but
i
was
afoot
and
knew
that
the
animal
could
outrun
me
however
swift
i
might
deem
myself
to
suppose
that
he
would
not
attack
me
would
have
been
to
suppose
an
improbability
i
did
not
reckon
upon
such
a
chance
i
knew
too
well
the
disposition
of
the
enemy
that
was
approaching
i
knew
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
grizzly
bear
is
the
assailant
that
no
animal
in
america
will
willingly
risk
a
contest
with
him
and
i
am
not
certain
that
the
lion
of
africa
would
wear
his
laurels
after
an
encounter
with
this
fierce
quadruped
man
himself
shuns
such
an
encounter
unless
mounted
upon
the
friendly
horse
and
even
then
where
the
ground
is
not
clear
and
open
the
prudent
trapper
always
gives
old
ephraim
the
prairie
sobriquet
of
the
grizzly
a
wide
berth
and
rides
on
without
molesting
him
the
white
hunter
reckons
a
grizzly
bear
equal
in
prowess
to
two
indians
while
the
indian
himself
accounts
the
destruction
of
one
of
these
animals
a
great
feat
in
his
life
history
among
indian
braves
a
necklace
of
claws
is
a
badge
of
honour
since
these
adornments
can
be
worn
only
by
the
man
who
has
himself
killed
the
animals
from
which
they
have
been
taken
on
the
other
hand
the
grizzly
bear
fears
no
adversary
he
assails
the
largest
animals
on
sight
the
elk
the
moose
the
bison
or
if
caught
is
instantly
killed
with
a
blow
of
his
paw
he
can
lay
open
the
flesh
as
if
it
had
been
gashed
with
an
axe
and
he
can
drag
the
body
of
a
buffalo
to
any
distance
he
rushes
upon
man
whether
mounted
or
on
foot
and
a
dozen
hunters
have
retreated
before
his
furious
assault
a
dozen
bullets
ay
nearly
twice
that
number
have
been
fired
into
the
body
of
a
grizzly
bear
without
killing
him
and
only
a
shot
through
the
brain
or
the
heart
will
prove
instantaneously
mortal
gifted
with
such
tenacity
of
life
and
sanguinary
fierceness
of
disposition
no
wonder
the
grizzly
bear
is
a
dreaded
creature
were
he
possessed
of
the
fleetness
of
the
lion
or
tiger
he
would
be
a
more
terrible
assailant
than
either
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
his
haunts
would
be
unapproachable
by
man
compared
with
the
horse
however
he
is
slow
of
foot
and
there
is
another
circumstance
scarcely
less
favourable
to
those
who
pass
through
his
district
he
is
not
a
indeed
he
does
not
inhabit
the
forest
but
there
is
usually
some
timber
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
haunts
and
many
a
life
has
been
saved
by
his
intended
victim
having
taken
refuge
in
a
tree
i
was
well
acquainted
with
these
points
in
the
natural
history
of
the
grizzly
bear
and
you
may
fancy
the
feelings
i
experienced
at
finding
myself
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
largest
and
fiercest
upon
the
naked
plain
alone
dismounted
almost
unarmed
there
was
not
a
bush
where
i
could
hide
myself
not
a
tree
into
which
i
might
climb
there
was
no
means
of
escape
and
almost
none
of
defence
the
knife
was
the
only
weapon
i
had
with
me
my
rifle
i
had
left
upon
the
other
side
of
the
barranca
and
to
reach
it
was
out
of
the
question
even
could
i
have
got
to
the
path
that
led
down
the
cliff
it
would
have
been
madness
to
attempt
crossing
there
for
although
not
a
the
grizzly
bear
by
means
of
his
great
claws
could
have
scaled
the
cliff
more
expeditiously
than
i
had
i
made
the
attempt
i
should
have
been
caught
before
i
could
have
reached
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
the
bear
was
directly
in
the
path
it
would
have
been
literally
flinging
myself
into
his
embrace
to
have
gone
that
way
these
reflections
occupy
minutes
of
your
time
to
i
them
in
less
than
moments
a
single
glance
around
showed
me
the
utter
helplessness
of
my
situation
i
saw
there
was
no
alternative
but
a
desperate
conflict
a
conflict
with
the
knife
despair
that
for
a
moment
had
unnerved
now
had
the
effect
of
bracing
me
and
fronting
my
fierce
foe
i
stood
ready
to
receive
him
i
had
heard
of
hunters
having
conquered
and
killed
the
grizzly
bear
with
no
other
weapon
than
a
knife
but
after
a
terrible
and
protracted
struggle
after
many
wounds
and
sore
loss
of
blood
i
had
read
in
the
book
of
a
naturalist
that
a
man
might
end
a
struggle
with
a
bear
in
a
few
instants
if
one
hand
be
sufficiently
at
liberty
to
grasp
the
throat
of
the
animal
with
the
thumb
and
fingers
externally
at
the
root
of
the
as
flight
degree
of
compression
there
will
generally
suffice
to
produce
a
spasm
of
the
glottis
that
will
soon
suffocate
the
bear
beyond
the
power
of
offering
resistance
or
doing
injury
beautiful
theory
sagacious
naturalist
how
wouldst
thou
like
to
make
the
experiment
hast
thou
ever
heard
of
birds
being
caught
by
the
application
of
salt
to
the
tail
the
theory
is
as
correct
as
thine
and
i
am
certain
the
practice
of
it
would
not
be
more
difficult
but
i
digress
among
these
i
had
no
time
to
reflect
upon
compressions
of
the
tongue
or
spasms
of
the
glottis
my
antagonist
soon
finished
his
reconnaissance
of
me
and
dropping
upon
and
uttering
a
loud
scream
rushed
towards
me
with
open
mouth
i
had
resolved
to
await
his
onset
but
as
he
came
nearer
and
i
beheld
his
great
gaunt
form
his
gleaming
teeth
and
his
eyes
flashing
like
fire
changed
my
design
a
new
thought
came
suddenly
into
my
mind
i
turned
and
fled
the
thought
that
prompted
me
to
adopt
this
course
was
that
just
then
i
remembered
the
antelope
i
had
shot
the
bear
might
be
attracted
by
the
carcass
and
pause
over
it
maybe
long
enough
to
give
me
a
start
or
enable
me
to
escape
altogether
if
not
my
situation
could
be
no
worse
than
it
then
was
alas
my
hope
was
on
reaching
the
antelope
the
fierce
monster
made
no
halt
i
glanced
back
to
see
he
was
already
past
it
and
following
rapidly
upon
my
heels
i
am
a
swift
runner
one
of
the
swiftest
many
a
triumph
can
i
remember
but
what
was
my
speed
against
such
a
competitor
i
was
only
running
myself
out
of
breath
i
should
be
less
prepared
for
the
desperate
conflict
that
must
after
all
take
place
better
for
me
to
turn
and
at
once
face
the
foe
i
had
half
resolved
was
about
to
turn
in
fact
when
an
object
flashed
before
my
eyes
that
dazzled
them
inadvertently
i
had
run
in
the
direction
of
the
pond
i
was
now
upon
its
edge
it
was
the
sun
gleaming
from
the
water
that
had
dazzled
me
for
the
surface
was
calm
as
a
mirror
a
new
idea
a
sort
of
rushed
into
my
mind
it
was
the
straw
to
the
drowning
man
the
fierce
brute
was
close
behind
me
another
instant
and
we
must
have
grappled
not
yet
not
yet
thought
i
i
shall
fight
him
in
the
water
in
the
deep
water
that
may
give
me
an
advantage
perhaps
then
the
contest
will
be
more
equal
perhaps
i
may
escape
by
diving
i
sprang
into
the
pond
without
a
moment
of
hesitation
the
water
was
i
plunged
onward
making
for
the
centre
the
spray
rose
round
me
the
pond
deepened
as
i
advanced
i
was
soon
up
to
the
waist
i
glanced
around
with
anxious
heart
the
bear
was
standing
upon
the
shore
to
my
surprise
and
joy
i
saw
that
he
had
halted
and
seemed
disinclined
to
follow
me
i
say
to
my
surprise
i
saw
this
for
i
knew
that
water
has
no
terrors
for
the
grizzly
bear
i
knew
that
he
could
swim
i
had
seen
many
of
his
kind
crossing
deep
lakes
and
rapid
rivers
what
then
hindered
him
from
following
me
i
could
not
guess
nor
indeed
did
i
try
to
guess
at
the
moment
i
thought
of
nothing
but
getting
farther
from
the
shore
and
waded
on
till
i
had
arrived
near
the
centre
of
the
lake
and
stood
in
the
water
i
could
go
no
farther
without
swimming
and
therefore
came
to
a
stand
with
my
face
turned
towards
my
pursuer
i
watched
his
every
movement
he
had
risen
once
more
upon
his
and
in
this
attitude
stood
looking
after
me
but
still
apparently
without
any
intention
of
taking
to
the
water
after
regarding
me
for
some
moments
he
fell
back
upon
and
commenced
running
round
the
border
of
the
pond
as
if
searching
for
a
place
to
enter
there
were
still
not
over
two
hundred
paces
between
us
for
the
pond
was
only
twice
that
in
diameter
he
could
easily
have
reached
me
had
he
felt
so
disposed
but
for
some
reason
or
other
he
seemed
disinclined
to
a
swim
though
for
nearly
he
kept
running
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
shore
now
and
then
he
made
short
excursions
out
into
the
prairie
but
always
returned
again
and
regarded
me
afresh
as
though
determined
not
to
lose
sight
of
me
for
any
length
of
time
i
was
in
hopes
that
he
might
stray
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
pond
and
give
me
the
chance
of
making
a
rush
for
the
ravine
but
no
he
continued
on
that
side
where
he
had
first
appeared
as
though
he
suspected
my
design
i
knew
not
how
long
the
siege
was
to
last
but
as
i
well
understood
the
implacable
disposition
of
the
grizzly
bear
i
could
not
hope
that
the
scene
would
be
otherwise
than
protracted
it
lasted
a
long
while
more
than
an
hour
i
should
think
i
began
to
despair
i
shivered
the
pond
must
have
been
a
spring
so
chill
were
its
waters
i
shivered
but
kept
my
place
i
dared
not
move
out
of
it
i
even
feared
to
agitate
the
water
around
me
lest
by
so
doing
i
might
excite
my
fierce
enemy
and
tempt
his
onset
i
shivered
but
stood
still
my
patience
was
at
length
rewarded
the
bear
making
one
of
his
short
tours
into
the
prairie
espied
the
carcass
of
the
antelope
i
saw
that
he
had
halted
over
something
though
i
could
not
tell
what
for
my
eyes
were
below
the
level
of
the
plain
presently
his
head
was
raised
again
and
in
his
jaws
were
the
remains
of
the
to
my
joy
i
perceived
that
he
was
dragging
it
towards
the
barranca
and
in
another
minute
he
had
disappeared
with
it
behind
the
cliff
chapter
twenty
three
the
toughest
struggle
of
my
life
i
swam
a
few
strokes
and
then
wading
gently
and
without
noise
i
stood
upon
the
sandy
shore
with
shivering
frame
and
dripping
garments
i
stood
uncertain
what
course
to
pursue
i
was
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
i
mean
opposite
to
where
i
had
entered
it
i
had
chosen
that
side
intentionally
lest
the
bear
should
suddenly
return
he
might
deposit
the
carcass
in
his
lair
and
come
back
to
look
after
me
it
is
a
habit
of
these
animals
when
not
pressed
by
immediate
hunger
to
bury
their
food
or
store
it
in
their
caves
even
the
devouring
of
the
little
antelope
would
have
been
an
affair
of
only
a
few
minutes
time
and
the
bear
might
still
return
more
ravenous
that
he
had
tasted
blood
i
was
filled
with
irresolution
should
i
run
off
across
the
plain
beyond
the
reach
of
pursuit
i
should
have
to
return
again
for
my
horse
and
rifle
to
take
to
the
prairie
on
foot
would
be
like
going
to
sea
without
a
boat
even
had
i
been
sure
of
reaching
the
settlements
in
safety
without
my
horse
i
could
not
think
of
leaving
him
behind
i
loved
my
moro
too
well
for
that
i
would
have
risked
life
itself
rather
than
part
with
the
noble
creature
no
the
idea
of
deserting
him
was
not
entertained
for
a
moment
but
how
was
i
to
join
him
the
only
path
by
which
i
could
cross
the
barranca
had
just
been
taken
by
the
bear
the
latter
was
no
doubt
still
upon
it
in
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
to
attempt
passing
over
would
be
to
bring
myself
once
more
under
the
eyes
of
the
fierce
brute
and
i
should
certainly
become
his
victim
another
idea
suggested
itself
to
go
up
the
barranca
and
find
a
crossing
or
else
head
the
chasm
altogether
and
come
down
upon
the
opposite
side
that
was
possibly
the
best
plan
to
pursue
i
was
about
starting
forward
to
execute
it
when
to
my
dismay
i
again
beheld
the
bear
this
time
not
upon
the
same
side
with
myself
but
upon
the
opposite
one
where
moro
was
picketed
he
was
just
climbing
out
of
the
ravine
when
i
first
saw
him
slowly
dragging
his
huge
body
over
the
escarpment
of
the
cliff
in
a
moment
he
stood
erect
upon
the
open
plain
i
was
filled
with
a
new
consternation
i
perceived
too
surely
that
he
was
about
to
attack
the
horse
the
latter
had
already
observed
the
bear
approach
and
seemed
to
be
fully
aware
of
his
danger
i
had
staked
him
at
the
distance
of
about
four
hundred
yards
from
the
barranca
and
upon
a
lazo
of
about
twenty
in
length
at
sight
of
the
bear
he
had
run
out
to
the
end
of
his
and
was
snorting
and
plunging
with
affright
this
new
dilemma
arrested
me
and
i
stood
with
anxious
feelings
to
watch
the
result
i
had
no
hope
of
being
able
to
yield
the
slightest
aid
to
my
poor
horse
at
least
none
occurred
to
me
at
the
moment
the
bear
made
directly
towards
him
and
my
heart
throbbed
wildly
as
i
saw
the
brute
approach
almost
within
clawing
distance
the
horse
sprang
round
however
and
galloped
upon
a
circle
of
which
the
lazo
was
the
radius
i
knew
from
the
hard
jerks
he
had
already
given
to
the
rope
that
there
was
no
chance
of
its
yielding
and
freeing
him
no
it
was
a
lazo
of
the
toughest
thong
i
knew
its
power
and
i
remembered
how
firmly
i
had
driven
home
the
this
i
now
regretted
what
would
i
have
given
to
have
been
able
at
that
moment
to
draw
the
blade
of
my
knife
across
that
rope
i
continued
to
watch
the
struggle
with
a
painful
feeling
of
suspense
the
horse
still
kept
out
of
the
bear
reach
by
galloping
round
the
circumference
of
the
circle
while
the
boar
made
his
attacks
by
crossing
its
chords
or
running
in
circles
of
lesser
diameter
the
whole
scene
bore
a
resemblance
to
an
act
at
the
hippodrome
moro
being
the
steed
and
the
bear
taking
the
part
of
the
once
or
twice
the
rope
circling
round
and
quite
taut
caught
upon
the
legs
of
the
bear
and
after
carrying
him
along
with
it
for
some
distance
flung
him
over
upon
his
back
this
seemed
to
add
to
his
rage
since
after
recovering
his
legs
again
he
ran
after
the
horse
with
redoubled
fury
i
could
have
been
amused
at
the
singular
spectacle
but
that
my
mind
was
too
painfully
agitated
about
the
result
the
scene
continued
for
some
minutes
without
much
change
in
the
relative
position
of
the
actors
i
began
to
hope
that
the
bear
might
be
baffled
after
all
and
finding
the
horse
too
nimble
for
him
might
desist
from
his
attacks
particularly
as
the
horse
had
already
administered
to
him
several
kicks
that
would
have
discomfited
any
other
assailant
these
however
only
rendered
the
brute
more
savage
and
vengeful
just
at
this
time
the
scene
assumed
a
new
phase
likely
to
bring
about
the
the
rope
had
once
more
pressed
against
the
bear
but
this
time
instead
of
trying
to
avoid
it
he
seized
it
in
his
teeth
and
paws
i
thought
at
first
he
was
going
to
cut
it
and
this
was
exactly
what
i
wished
for
but
no
to
my
consternation
i
saw
that
he
was
crawling
along
it
by
constantly
renewing
his
hold
and
thus
gradually
and
surely
drawing
nearer
to
his
victim
the
horse
now
screamed
with
terror
i
could
bear
the
sight
no
longer
i
remembered
that
i
had
left
my
rifle
near
the
edge
of
the
barranca
and
some
distance
from
the
horse
i
remembered
too
that
after
shooting
the
antelope
i
had
carefully
reloaded
it
i
ran
forward
to
the
cliff
and
dashed
madly
down
its
face
i
climbed
the
opposite
steep
and
clutching
the
gun
rushed
towards
the
scene
of
strife
i
was
still
in
time
the
bear
had
not
yet
reached
his
victim
though
now
within
less
than
six
feet
of
him
i
advanced
within
ten
paces
and
fired
as
though
my
shot
had
cut
the
thong
it
gave
way
at
the
moment
and
the
horse
with
a
wild
neigh
sprang
off
into
the
prairie
i
had
hit
the
bear
as
i
afterwards
ascertained
but
not
in
a
vital
part
and
my
bullet
had
no
more
effect
upon
him
than
if
it
had
been
a
drop
of
it
was
the
strength
of
despair
that
had
broken
the
rope
and
set
free
the
steed
it
was
my
turn
now
for
the
bear
as
soon
as
he
perceived
that
the
horse
had
escaped
him
turned
and
sprang
upon
me
uttering
as
he
did
so
a
loud
scream
i
had
no
choice
but
fight
i
had
no
time
to
reload
i
struck
the
brute
once
with
my
clubbed
rifle
and
flinging
the
gun
away
grasped
the
readier
knife
with
the
strong
keen
blade
the
knife
was
a
bowie
i
struck
out
before
me
but
the
next
moment
i
felt
myself
grappled
and
held
fast
the
sharp
claws
tore
up
my
flesh
one
paw
was
griped
over
my
hips
another
rested
on
my
shoulder
while
the
white
teeth
gleamed
before
my
eyes
my
was
free
i
had
watched
this
when
grappling
and
with
all
the
energy
of
despair
i
plunged
the
keen
blade
between
the
ribs
of
my
antagonist
again
and
again
i
plunged
it
seeking
for
the
heart
at
every
stab
we
rolled
together
upon
the
ground
over
and
over
again
the
red
blood
covered
us
both
i
saw
it
welling
from
the
lips
of
the
fierce
monster
and
i
joyed
to
think
that
my
knife
reached
his
vitals
i
was
wild
i
was
mad
i
was
burning
with
a
fierce
vengeance
with
anger
such
as
one
might
feel
for
a
human
foe
over
and
over
the
ground
in
the
fierce
struggle
of
life
and
death
again
i
felt
the
terrible
claws
the
tearing
teeth
again
sank
my
blade
up
to
the
hilt
gracious
heaven
how
many
lives
has
he
will
he
never
yield
to
the
red
steel
see
the
blood
rivers
of
blood
the
prairie
is
red
we
roll
in
blood
i
am
sick
sick
i
faint
chapter
twenty
four
old
comrades
i
fancied
myself
in
a
future
world
battling
with
some
fearful
demon
no
those
forms
i
see
around
me
are
of
the
earth
i
still
live
my
wounds
pain
me
some
one
is
binding
them
up
his
hand
is
rude
but
the
tender
expression
of
his
eye
tells
me
that
his
heart
is
kind
who
is
he
whence
came
he
i
am
still
upon
the
wide
prairie
i
see
that
clearly
enough
where
is
my
terrible
antagonist
i
remember
our
fierce
fight
everything
that
occurred
but
thought
he
had
killed
i
certainly
dead
but
no
it
can
not
have
been
i
still
live
i
see
above
me
the
blue
sky
around
me
the
green
plain
near
me
are
forms
the
forms
of
men
and
yonder
are
horses
too
into
whose
hands
have
i
fallen
whoever
they
be
they
are
friends
they
must
have
rescued
me
from
the
gripe
of
the
monster
but
how
no
one
was
in
sight
how
could
they
have
arrived
in
time
i
would
ask
but
have
not
strength
the
men
are
still
bending
over
me
i
observe
one
with
large
beard
and
brown
bushy
workers
there
is
another
face
old
and
thin
and
tanned
to
a
copper
colour
my
eyes
wander
from
one
to
the
other
some
distant
recollections
stir
within
me
those
faces
now
i
see
them
but
dimly
i
see
them
no
longer
i
fainted
and
was
again
insensible
once
more
i
became
conscious
and
this
time
felt
stronger
i
could
better
understand
what
was
passing
around
me
i
observed
that
the
sun
was
going
down
a
buffalo
robe
suspended
upon
two
upright
saplings
guarded
his
slanting
rays
from
the
spot
where
i
lay
my
seraph
was
under
me
and
my
head
rested
in
my
saddle
over
which
another
robe
had
been
laid
i
lay
upon
my
side
and
the
position
gave
me
a
view
of
all
that
was
passing
a
fire
was
burning
near
by
which
were
two
persons
one
seated
the
other
standing
my
eyes
passed
from
one
to
the
other
scanning
each
in
turn
the
younger
stood
leaning
on
his
rifle
looking
into
the
fire
he
was
the
type
of
a
mountain
man
a
trapper
he
was
full
six
feet
in
his
moccasins
and
of
a
build
that
suggested
the
idea
of
strength
and
saxon
ancestry
his
arms
were
like
young
oaks
and
his
hand
grasping
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
appeared
large
fleshless
and
muscular
his
cheek
was
broad
and
firm
and
was
partially
covered
with
a
bushy
whisker
that
met
over
the
chin
while
a
beard
of
the
same
colour
dull
brown
fringed
his
lips
the
eye
was
grey
or
bluish
grey
small
and
rarely
wandering
the
hair
was
light
brown
and
the
complexion
of
the
face
which
had
evidently
once
been
blonde
was
now
nearly
as
dark
as
that
of
a
had
produced
this
metamorphosis
the
countenance
was
prepossessing
it
might
have
been
once
handsome
its
expression
was
bold
but
and
bespoke
a
kind
and
generous
nature
the
dress
of
this
individual
was
the
costume
of
his
class
a
of
dressed
smoked
to
the
softness
of
a
glove
leggings
reaching
to
the
hips
and
fringed
down
the
seams
moccasins
of
true
indian
make
soled
with
buffalo
hide
the
was
belted
around
the
waist
but
open
above
so
as
to
leave
the
throat
and
part
of
the
breast
uncovered
but
over
the
breast
could
be
seen
the
of
finer
material
the
dressed
skin
of
the
young
antelope
or
the
fawn
of
the
a
short
cape
part
of
the
hung
gracefully
over
the
shoulders
ending
in
a
deep
fringe
cut
out
of
the
buckskin
itself
a
similar
fringe
embellished
the
draping
of
the
skirt
on
the
head
was
a
the
face
of
the
animal
over
the
front
while
the
barred
tail
like
a
plume
fell
drooping
over
the
left
shoulder
the
accoutrements
were
a
made
from
the
undressed
skin
of
a
ornamented
with
the
head
of
the
beautiful
this
hung
under
the
right
arm
suspended
by
a
and
attached
in
a
similar
manner
was
a
huge
horn
upon
which
was
carved
many
a
strange
souvenir
his
arms
consisted
of
a
knife
and
pistol
both
stuck
in
the
and
a
long
rifle
so
straight
that
the
line
of
the
barrel
seemed
scarcely
to
deflect
from
that
of
the
butt
but
little
attention
had
been
paid
to
ornament
in
either
his
dress
arms
or
equipments
and
yet
there
was
a
gracefulness
in
the
hang
of
his
shirt
a
stylishness
about
the
fringing
and
and
an
air
of
jauntiness
in
the
set
of
the
cap
that
showed
the
wearer
was
not
altogether
unmindful
of
his
personal
appearance
a
small
pouch
or
case
ornamented
with
stained
porcupine
quills
hung
down
upon
his
breast
this
was
the
no
doubt
a
from
some
damsel
like
himself
a
denizen
of
the
wilderness
his
companion
was
very
different
in
appearance
unlike
him
in
almost
every
respect
unlike
anybody
in
the
world
the
whole
appearance
of
this
individual
was
odd
and
striking
he
was
seated
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
with
his
face
partially
turned
towards
me
and
his
head
sunk
down
between
a
pair
of
long
lank
thighs
he
looked
more
like
the
stump
of
a
tree
dressed
in
buckskin
than
a
human
being
and
had
his
arms
not
been
in
motion
he
might
have
been
mistaken
for
such
an
object
both
his
arms
and
jaws
were
moving
the
latter
engaged
in
polishing
a
rib
of
meat
which
he
had
half
roasted
over
the
coals
his
dress
if
dress
it
could
be
called
was
simple
as
it
was
savage
it
consisted
of
what
might
have
once
been
a
but
which
now
looked
more
like
a
leathern
bag
with
the
bottom
ripped
open
and
sleeves
sewed
into
the
sides
it
was
of
a
colour
wrinkled
at
the
hollow
of
the
arms
patched
round
the
armpits
and
greasy
all
over
it
was
fairly
caked
with
dirt
there
was
no
attempt
at
either
ornament
or
fringe
there
had
been
a
cape
but
this
had
evidently
been
drawn
upon
from
time
to
time
for
patches
and
other
uses
until
scarcely
a
vestige
of
it
remained
the
leggings
and
moccasins
were
on
a
par
with
the
shirt
and
seemed
to
have
been
manufactured
out
of
the
same
hide
they
too
were
patched
wrinkled
and
greasy
they
did
not
meet
each
other
but
left
bare
a
piece
of
the
ankle
and
that
also
was
like
the
buckskin
there
was
no
undershirt
waistcoat
or
other
garment
to
be
seen
with
the
exception
of
a
cap
which
had
once
been
catskin
but
the
hair
was
all
worn
off
leaving
a
greasy
surface
that
corresponded
well
with
the
other
parts
of
the
dress
cap
shirt
leggings
and
moccasins
looked
as
if
they
had
never
been
stripped
off
since
the
day
they
were
first
tried
on
and
that
might
have
been
many
a
year
ago
the
shirt
was
open
displaying
the
naked
breast
and
throat
and
these
as
well
as
the
face
hands
and
ankles
had
been
tanned
by
the
sun
and
smoked
by
the
fire
to
the
hue
of
rusty
copper
the
whole
man
clothes
and
all
looked
as
if
he
had
been
smoked
on
purpose
his
face
bespoke
a
man
of
sixty
or
thereabout
his
features
were
sharp
and
somewhat
aquiline
and
the
small
eyes
were
dark
quick
and
piercing
his
hair
was
black
and
cut
short
his
complexion
had
been
naturally
brunette
though
there
was
nothing
of
the
frenchman
or
spaniard
in
his
physiognomy
he
was
more
likely
of
the
breed
as
i
looked
at
this
man
i
saw
that
there
was
a
strangeness
about
him
independently
of
the
oddness
of
his
attire
there
was
something
peculiar
about
his
head
something
what
was
it
that
was
wanting
it
was
his
ears
there
is
something
awful
in
a
man
without
his
ears
it
suggests
some
horrid
drama
some
terrible
scene
of
cruel
vengeance
it
suggests
the
idea
of
crime
committed
and
punishment
inflicted
i
might
have
had
such
unpleasant
imaginings
but
that
i
chanced
to
know
why
those
ears
were
wanting
i
remembered
the
man
who
was
sitting
before
me
it
seemed
a
dream
or
rather
the
of
an
old
scene
years
before
i
had
seen
that
individual
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
situation
very
similar
my
eyes
first
rested
upon
him
seated
as
he
was
now
over
a
fire
roasting
and
eating
the
attitude
was
the
same
the
in
no
respect
different
there
was
the
same
greasy
catskin
cap
the
same
scant
leggings
the
same
brown
buckskin
covering
over
the
lanky
frame
perhaps
neither
shirt
nor
leggings
had
been
taken
off
since
i
last
saw
them
they
appeared
no
dirtier
however
that
was
not
possible
nor
was
it
possible
having
once
looked
upon
the
wearer
ever
to
forget
him
i
remembered
him
at
a
glance
reuben
bawling
or
old
rube
as
he
was
more
commonly
called
one
of
the
most
celebrated
of
trappers
the
younger
man
was
bill
garey
another
celebrity
of
the
same
profession
and
old
rube
partner
and
constant
companion
my
heart
gladdened
at
the
sight
of
these
old
acquaintances
i
knew
i
was
with
friends
i
was
about
to
call
out
to
them
when
my
eye
wandering
beyond
rested
upon
the
group
of
horses
and
what
i
saw
startled
me
from
my
recumbent
position
there
was
rube
old
blind
her
lank
grizzled
body
naked
tail
and
mulish
look
i
remembered
well
there
too
was
the
large
powerful
horse
of
garey
and
there
was
my
own
steed
moro
picketed
beside
them
this
was
a
joyful
surprise
to
me
as
he
had
galloped
off
after
his
escape
from
the
bear
and
i
had
felt
anxious
about
recovering
him
but
it
was
not
the
sight
of
moro
that
caused
me
to
start
with
astonishment
it
was
at
seeing
another
animal
another
horse
was
i
mistaken
was
it
an
illusion
were
my
eyes
or
my
fancy
again
mocking
me
no
it
was
a
reality
there
was
the
noble
form
the
graceful
and
symmetrical
outlines
the
smooth
coat
of
silver
white
the
flowing
tail
the
upright
jetty
ears
all
were
before
my
eyes
it
was
he
white
steed
of
the
chapter
twenty
five
a
queer
conversation
the
surprise
with
the
exertion
i
had
made
in
raising
myself
overcame
me
and
i
fell
back
in
a
swoon
it
was
but
a
momentary
dizziness
and
in
a
short
while
i
was
again
conscious
meanwhile
the
two
men
had
approached
and
having
applied
something
cold
to
my
temples
stood
near
me
conversing
i
heard
every
word
durn
the
weemen
i
recognised
rube
voice
thur
allers
a
gittin
a
fellur
into
some
scrape
hyur
a
putty
pickle
to
be
in
an

drawlingly
responded
garey

strong

rube
although
i
had
my
eyes
partially
open
i
could
not
see
rube
as
he
was
standing
behind
the
suspended
robe
but
a
gurgling
clucking
sound
somewhat
like
that
made
in
pouring
water
from
a
bottle
reached
my
ears
and
told
me
what
effect
garey
remark
had
produced
upon
his
companion
cuss
me

the
latter
at
length
rejoined

no
part
in
the
conversation
nor
had
i
indicated
to
either
of
the
trappers
that
i
was
aware
of
their
presence
everything
was
enveloped
in
mystery
the
presence
of
the
white
steed
had
sufficiently
astonished
me
and
not
less
that
of
my
old
acquaintances
rube
and
garey
the
whole
scene
was
a
puzzle
i
was
equally
at
a
loss
to
account
for
their
being
acquainted
with
the
cause
that
had
brought
there
that
they
were
so
was
evident
from
their
conversation
where
could
they
have
procured
their
information
on
this
head
neither
of
them
had
been
at
the
rancheria
nor
in
the
army
anywhere
certainly
not
else
i
should
have
heard
of
them
indeed
either
of
them
would
have
made
himself
known
to
me
as
a
strong
friendship
had
formerly
existed
between
us
but
they
alone
could
give
me
an
explanation
and
without
further
conjecture
i
turned
to
them
rube
garey
i
said
holding
out
my
hand
hilloo

said
the
other
with
an
air
of
rude
kindness
at
the
same
time
holding
out
a
small
gourd
which
i
applied
to
my
lips
it
was
of
el
paso
better
known
among
the
as
the
immediate
effect
of
this
strong
but
not
bad
spirit
was
to
strengthen
my
nerves
and
render
me
abler
to
converse
i
see

o
and
so
saying
the
leathery
figure
moved
off
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
followed
by
his
younger
companion
although
i
was
anxious
to
have
a
further
explanation
about
the
other
points
that
puzzled
me
about
the
steed
the
trappers
own
presence
their
knowledge
of
my
wild
hunt
and
its
antecedents
i
knew
it
would
be
useless
to
question
old
rube
any
further
after
what
he
had
said
i
was
compelled
therefore
to
follow
his
advice
and
remain
quiet
chapter
twenty
six
vows
of
vengeance
i
soon
fell
asleep
again
and
this
time
slept
long
and
profoundly
it
was
after
nightfall
in
fact
near
midnight
when
i
awoke
the
air
had
grown
chilly
but
i
found
i
had
not
been
neglected
my
serape
was
wrapped
closely
around
me
and
with
a
had
sufficiently
protected
me
from
the
cold
while
i
slept
on
awaking
i
felt
much
better
and
stronger
i
looked
around
for
my
companions
the
fire
had
gone
out
no
doubt
intentionally
extinguished
lest
its
glare
amid
the
darkness
might
attract
the
eye
of
some
roving
indian
the
night
was
a
clear
one
though
moonless
but
the
heaven
was
spangled
with
its
sparkling
worlds
and
the
starlight
enabled
me
to
make
out
the
forms
of
the
two
trappers
and
the
group
of
browsing
horses
of
the
former
one
only
was
asleep
the
other
sat
upright
keeping
guard
over
the
camp
he
was
motionless
as
a
statue
but
the
small
spark
gleaming
like
a
glowworm
from
the
bowl
of
his
tobacco
pipe
gave
token
of
his
wakefulness
dim
as
the
light
was
i
could
distinguish
the
upright
form
to
be
that
of
the
earless
trapper
it
was
garey
who
was
sleeping
i
could
have
wished
it
otherwise
i
was
anxious
to
have
some
conversation
with
the
younger
of
my
companions
i
was
longing
for
an
explanation
and
i
should
have
preferred
addressing
myself
to
garey
my
anxiety
would
not
allow
me
to
wait
and
i
turned
towards
rube
he
sat
near
me
and
i
spoke
in
a
low
tone
so
as
not
to
awake
the
sleeper
how
came
you
to
find
me
by
follerin
yur
trail
oh

followed
me
then

for
you
i
might
never

left
this
spot
thanks
old
comrades
thanks
every
point
was
now
cleared
up
there
was
mystery
no
longer
though
from
an
expression
which
garey
had
dropped
i
still
desired
a
word
with
him
in
private
on
further
inquiry
i
learned
that
the
trappers
were
on
their
way
to
take
part
in
the
campaign
some
barbarous
treatment
they
had
experienced
from
mexican
soldiers
at
a
frontier
post
had
rendered
both
of
them
inveterate
foes
to
mexico
and
rube
declared
he
would
never
be
contented
until
he
had
plugged
a
score
of
the
vamints
the
breaking
out
of
the
war
gave
them
the
opportunity
they
desired
and
they
were
now
on
their
way
from
a
distant
part
of
to
take
a
hand
in
it
the
vehemence
of
their
hostility
towards
the
mexicans
somewhat
surprised
me
as
i
knew
it
was
a
recent
feeling
with
them
and
i
inquired
more
particularly
into
the
nature
of
the
they
had
received
they
answered
me
by
giving
a
detailed
account
of
the
affair
it
had
occurred
at
one
of
the
mexican
frontier
towns
where
upon
a
slight
pretext
the
trappers
had
been
arrested
and
flogged
by
order
of
the
commanding
officer
of
the
post
said
rube
the
words
hissing
angrily
through
his
teeth
flogged
a
flogged
by
a
cussed
monkey
of
a
mexikin
a
mind
a
mind
by
the
god
an
when
i
say
thet
i
swar
it
this
niggur
do
leave
mexiko
till
he
hes
rubbed
out
a
soger
for
every
lash
they
gin
him
an
that
twenty
hyur
another
old
hoss
cried
garey
with
equal
earnestness
of
manner
hyur
another
that
swars
the
same
oath
yes
billee
boy
i
guess
we
count
some
in
a
skrimmage
thur
two
lookee
thur
young
fellur
as
rube
said
this
he
held
his
rifle
close
to
my
eyes
pointing
with
his
finger
to
a
particular
part
of
the
stock
i
saw
two
small
notches
freshly
cut
in
the
wood
i
knew
well
enough
what
these
notches
meant
they
were
a
registry
of
the
deaths
of
two
mexicans
who
had
fallen
by
the
hand
or
bullet
of
the
trapper
they
had
not
been
the
only
victims
of
that
unerring
and
deadly
weapon
on
the
same
piece
of
i
could
see
long
rows
of
similar
apart
from
each
other
only
differing
a
little
in
shape
i
knew
something
of
the
signification
of
these
horrible
hieroglyphics
i
knew
they
were
the
history
of
a
life
fearfully
spent
a
life
of
red
realities
the
sight
was
far
from
pleasant
i
turned
my
eyes
away
and
remained
silent
mark
me
young
fellur
continued
rube
who
noticed
that
i
was
not
gratified
by
the
inspection
do
mistake
bill
garey
an
me
for
wild
beests
we
ai
thet
quite
we
been
mighty
riled
i
but
all
thet
we
ai
to
take

on

no

whur
i

bekase
the
injuns
thet
we
left
we
jest
kum
from
thur
we
want
fair
fight
among
christyun
whites
thet
why
we
hyur
now
young
fellur
i
was
glad
to
hear
rube
talk
in
this
manner
and
i
so
signified
to
him
indianised
as
the
old
trapper
was
with
all
his
savageness
all
his
reckless
indifference
to
ordinary
emotions
i
knew
there
was
still
a
touch
of
humanity
in
his
breast
indeed
on
more
than
one
occasion
i
had
witnessed
singular
displays
of
fine
feeling
on
the
part
of
rube
circumstanced
as
he
was
he
is
not
to
be
judged
by
the
laws
of
civilised
life
your
intention
then
is
to
join
some
corps
of
rangers
is
it
not
i
asked
after
a
pause
i
shed
like
it
replied
garey
i
shed
like
to
join
your
company
but
rube
hyur
wo
consent
to
it
no
exclaimed
the
other
with
emphasis
i
jine
no
kumpny
this
niggur
fights
on
his

hook
yur

young
fellur
i
hev
been
all
my
life
a
free
mountaineeman
an
do
understan
sogerin
nohow
i

boyee
i
guess
so
old
hoss
replied
garey
mildly
but
for
all
that
rube
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
go
at
it
in
a
reglar
way
particlarly
as
the
hyur
would
make
the
sogerin
part
as
easy
as
possible
yur
the
discipline
of
my
corps
is
not
very
severe
we
are
and
our
duties
are
different
from
those
of
regular
soldiers
it
ur
no
use
interrupted
rube
i
must
fight
as
i
allers

free

i
wo
bind
myself
to
nuthin
i

by

chapter
twenty
seven
a
weed
on
fire
my
recovery
was
rapid
my
wounds
though
deep
were
not
dangerous
they
were
only
and
closed
rapidly
under
the
cauterising
influence
of
the
rude
as
my
doctors
were
in
the
matter
of
such
a
malady
i
could
not
have
fallen
into
better
hands
both
during
their
lives
of
accident
and
exposure
had
ample
practice
in
the
healing
art
and
i
would
have
trusted
either
in
the
curing
of
a
bite
or
the
tear
of
a
grizzly
bear
claw
in
preference
to
the
most
accomplished
surgeon
old
rube
in
particular
thoroughly
understood
the
simple
pharmacopoeia
of
the
prairies
and
his
application
to
my
wounds
of
the
sap
of
the
plant
obtained
among
the
rocks
of
the
ravine
bespoke
his
skill
this
plant
a
bromelia
is
of
the
same
genus
as
the
and
by
travellers
often
confounded
with
the
latter
though
quite
a
distinct
plant
from
the
of
cultivation
it
grows
in
most
parts
of
mexico
and
south
america
extending
as
far
north
as
the
latitude
of
degrees
and
even
farther
there
is
no
spot
too
arid
or
barren
to
give
support
to
it
it
is
a
true
desert
plant
and
even
on
the
naked
rock
its
curved
and
thorny
blades
may
be
seen
radiating
on
all
sides
from
the
tall
that
shoots
upward
like
a
to
the
height
of
twenty
feet
as
already
observed
its
uses
are
manifold
the
fibre
of
its
leaves
can
be
manufactured
into
thread
cordage
and
cloth
fences
are
constructed
of
the
growing
plant
and
thatch
of
the
blades
when
cut
its
sap
distilled
furnishes
the
fiery
but
not
unwholesome
mezcal
and
the
large
core
or
stem
is
eaten
for
food
tribes
of
indians
lipans
comanches
and
apaches
use
it
extensively
as
an
article
of
diet
one
branch
of
the
great
apache
nation
are
distinguished
eaters
of
the
they
bake
it
in
of
heated
stones
along
with
the
flesh
of
the
it
is
firm
when
cooked
with
a
translucent
appearance
like
candied
fruits
i
have
eaten
it
it
is
palatable
i
might
say
delicious
the
mastication
of
it
is
accompanied
by
a
prinkling
sensation
upon
the
tongue
singular
to
one
unaccustomed
to
it
it
is
a
gift
of
nature
to
the
desert
regions
where
it
grows
in
greatest
luxuriance
and
where
it
serves
the
same
purpose
in
the
economy
of
the
savage
natives
as
the
and
the
caffre
bread
upon
the
arid
karoos
of
southern
africa
one
of
the
most
esteemed
qualities
of
this
bromelia
is
the
cauterising
property
of
its
juice
well
known
to
the
natives
of
the
mexican
and
to
the
peruvians
where
several
species
are
found
of
like
virtues
it
will
cause
ordinary
wounds
to
cicatrise
in
a
few
hours
and
even
ugly
gashes
will
yield
to
it
in
time
my
companions
had
full
knowledge
of
its
effects
and
having
extracted
the
sap
from
its
large
succulent
leaves
and
boiled
it
to
the
consistency
of
honey
they
applied
it
to
my
wounds
this
operation
they
from
time
to
time
repeated
and
the
scratches
were
healed
in
a
period
marvellously
short
my
strength
too
was
soon
restored
garey
with
his
gun
catered
for
the
cuisine
and
the
ruffed
grouse
the
prairie
partridge
and
roasted
ribs
of
fresh
venison
were
dainties
even
to
an
invalid
in
three
days
i
was
strong
enough
to
mount
and
bidding
adieu
to
our
we
all
three
set
forth
taking
with
us
our
beautiful
captive
he
was
still
as
wild
as
a
deer
but
we
had
adopted
precautions
to
prevent
him
from
getting
away
from
us
the
trappers
led
him
between
them
secured
to
the
saddles
of
both
by
a
lazo
we
did
not
return
in
the
direction
of
our
old
trail
my
companions
knew
a
shorter
route
at
least
one
upon
which
we
should
sooner
reach
water
and
that
is
the
most
important
consideration
on
a
we
headed
in
a
more
westerly
direction
by
which
keeping
in
a
straight
line
we
expected
to
strike
the
rio
grande
some
distance
above
the
rancheria
the
sky
was
the
sun
not
being
visible
and
with
no
guide
in
the
heavens
we
knew
that
we
might
easily
diverge
from
a
direct
course
to
provide
against
this
my
companions
had
recourse
to
a
compass
of
their
own
invention
on
taking
our
departure
from
camp
a
sapling
was
stuck
into
the
ground
and
upon
the
top
of
this
was
adjusted
a
piece
of
which
with
the
long
hair
upon
it
could
be
distinguished
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
or
more
the
direction
having
been
determined
upon
another
wand
similarly
garnished
with
a
tuft
of
the
was
set
up
several
hundred
yards
distant
from
the
first
turning
our
backs
upon
these
we
rode
off
with
perfect
confidence
glancing
back
at
intervals
to
make
sure
we
were
keeping
the
line
so
long
as
they
remained
in
sight
and
with
each
other
we
could
not
otherwise
than
travel
in
a
straight
path
it
was
an
ingenious
contrivance
but
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
been
witness
to
the
ingenuity
of
my
and
therefore
i
was
not
astonished
when
the
black
tufts
were
hidden
from
view
a
similar
pair
the
materials
for
which
had
been
brought
along
were
erected
and
these
insured
our
direction
for
another
stretch
of
a
mile
then
fresh
saplings
were
planted
and
so
on
till
we
had
passed
over
six
miles
of
the
plain
we
now
came
in
sight
of
timber
right
ahead
of
us
and
apparently
about
five
miles
distant
towards
this
we
directed
our
course
we
reached
the
timber
about
noon
and
found
it
to
consist
of
and
groves
with
mezquite
and
wild
interspersed
and
here
and
there
some
taller
trees
of
the
it
was
not
a
close
forest
but
a
succession
of
groves
with
openings
between
avenues
and
grassy
glades
there
were
many
pleasant
spots
and
faint
with
the
ride
i
would
fain
have
chosen
one
of
them
for
a
but
there
was
no
water
and
without
water
we
could
not
halt
a
short
distance
farther
and
we
should
reach
a
stream
a
small
an
affluent
of
the
rio
grande
so
promised
my
companions
and
we
rode
onward
after
passing
a
mile
or
so
through
the
we
came
out
on
the
edge
of
a
prairie
of
considerable
extent
it
was
full
three
miles
in
diameter
and
differed
altogether
from
the
plain
we
had
left
behind
us
it
was
of
the
kind
known
in
hunter
phraseology
as
a
that
is
instead
of
having
a
grassy
turf
its
surface
was
covered
in
a
thick
growth
of
as
malvas
altheas
and
other
tall
annuals
standing
side
by
side
and
frequently
laced
together
by
vines
and
various
species
of
convolvulus
such
a
was
the
one
now
before
us
but
not
a
flower
was
in
sight
they
had
all
bloomed
faded
and
fallen
perhaps
unseen
by
human
eye
and
the
withered
stalks
burned
by
a
hot
sun
looked
brown
and
forbidding
they
tracked
and
broke
at
the
slightest
touch
their
shelling
their
contents
like
rain
upon
the
loose
earth
instead
of
striking
across
this
prairie
we
skirted
around
its
edge
and
at
no
great
distance
arrived
on
the
banks
of
the
arroyo
we
had
made
but
a
short
march
but
my
companions
fearful
that
a
longer
ride
might
bring
on
fever
proposed
to
encamp
there
for
the
night
and
finish
our
journey
on
the
following
day
though
i
felt
strong
enough
to
have
gone
farther
i
made
no
objection
to
the
proposal
and
our
horses
were
at
once
unsaddled
and
picketed
near
the
banks
of
the
arroyo
the
stream
ran
through
a
little
covered
with
a
sward
of
grass
and
upon
this
we
staked
our
steeds
but
a
better
place
offered
for
our
camp
upon
the
higher
ground
and
we
chose
a
spot
under
the
shade
of
a
large
upon
the
edge
of
the
great
wilderness
of
weeds
to
this
place
we
carried
our
saddles
bridles
and
blankets
and
having
collected
a
quantity
of
dead
branches
kindled
our
we
had
already
quenched
our
thirst
at
the
stream
but
although
we
were
all
three
hungry
enough
the
dried
flesh
of
the
grizzly
bear
proved
but
a
poor
repast
the
rivulet
looked
promising
for
fish
garey
had
both
hooks
and
line
in
his
possible
sack
and
i
proposed
the
angle
the
young
trapper
soon
baited
his
hooks
and
he
and
i
repairing
to
the
stream
cast
our
lines
sat
down
and
waited
for
a
nibble
fishing
was
not
to
rube
taste
for
a
few
minutes
he
stood
watching
us
but
evidently
with
little
interest
either
in
the
sport
or
what
it
might
produce
rube
was
not
a
durn
yur
fish
exclaimed
he
at
length
i
ruther
hev
a
hunk
than
all
the
fish
in
texas
i
jest
see
ef
i
kin
scare
up
somethin
the
place
looks
likely
for
deer
it
do
so
saying
the
old
trapper
shouldered
his
long
rifle
and
stalking
off
up
the
bank
was
soon
out
of
sight
garey
and
i
continued
bobbing
with
but
indifferent
success
we
had
succeeded
in
drawing
out
a
couple
of
not
the
most
palatable
of
the
finny
tribe
when
the
crack
of
rube
rifle
sounded
in
our
ears
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
and
we
both
ran
up
on
the
high
bank
to
ascertain
what
success
had
attended
the
shot
sure
enough
rube
was
out
in
the
prairie
nearly
half
a
mile
distant
from
the
camp
his
head
and
shoulders
were
just
visible
above
the
tall
stalks
of
the
helianthus
and
we
could
see
by
his
stooping
at
intervals
that
he
was
bending
over
some
game
he
had
killed
skinning
or
cutting
it
up
the
game
we
could
not
see
on
account
of
the
interposed
culms
of
the
weeds
a
deer
i
remarked
garey
buffler
do
often
o
late
years
stray
so
far
to
the
southert
though
i
killed
some
on
the
grande
higher
up
without
other
remark
passing
between
us
we
descended
to
the
arroyo
and
recommenced
our
fishing
we
took
it
for
granted
that
rube
did
not
require
any
aid
or
he
would
have
signalled
to
us
he
would
soon
return
with
his
game
to
the
camp
we
had
just
discovered
that
a
species
of
were
plentiful
in
the
stream
and
this
kept
our
attention
fixed
we
were
desirous
of
taking
some
of
them
for
our
dinner
knowing
them
to
be
excellent
eating
and
far
superior
to
the
despised
cat
having
changed
our
bait
for
some
small
pieces
of
which
my
uniform
furnished
we
succeeded
in
pulling
several
of
these
beautiful
creatures
out
of
the
water
and
were
congratulating
one
another
upon
the
delicious
broil
we
should
have
when
our
conversation
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
crackling
noise
that
caused
both
of
us
to
turn
our
faces
towards
the
prairie
the
sight
that
met
our
eyes
prompted
us
to
spring
simultaneously
to
our
feet
our
horses
already
reared
upon
their
lazoes
neighing
with
affright
and
the
wild
screams
of
rube
were
loud
and
continuous
there
was
no
mystery
about
the
cause
that
was
obvious
at
a
glance
the
wind
had
blown
some
sparks
among
the
dry
the
was
on
fire
though
startled
at
the
first
sight
of
the
conflagration
for
ourselves
we
had
nothing
to
fear
the
bottom
on
which
we
stood
was
a
sward
of
short
it
was
not
likely
to
catch
fire
and
even
if
it
did
we
could
easily
escape
from
it
there
is
not
much
danger
in
a
burning
prairie
where
the
grass
is
light
and
short
one
can
dash
through
the
line
of
flame
with
no
greater
injury
than
the
singeing
of
his
hair
or
a
little
suffocation
from
the
smoke
but
upon
a
plain
covered
with
rank
and
thick
vegetation
the
case
is
very
different
we
therefore
felt
no
apprehension
for
ourselves
but
we
did
for
our
companion
situation
filled
us
with
alarm
was
he
still
where
we
had
last
seen
him
this
was
the
first
question
we
asked
one
another
if
so
then
his
peril
was
great
indeed
his
escape
would
be
almost
hopeless
we
had
observed
him
a
full
out
among
the
weeds
and
on
foot
too
to
have
attempted
a
retreat
towards
the
opposite
side
of
the
prairie
would
have
been
folly
it
was
three
miles
off
even
on
horseback
the
flames
would
have
overtaken
him
mounted
or
on
foot
he
could
not
have
got
out
of
the
way
through
those
tall
stalks
laced
as
they
were
by
and
other
trailing
plants
whose
tough
tangle
would
have
hindered
the
progress
even
of
the
strongest
horse
to
have
returned
to
the
near
side
would
be
his
only
chance
but
that
would
be
in
the
very
face
of
the
fire
and
unless
he
had
started
long
before
the
flames
broke
out
it
was
evident
that
his
retreat
in
that
direction
would
be
cut
off
as
already
stated
the
weeds
were
as
dry
as
tinder
and
the
flames
impelled
by
gusts
of
wind
at
intervals
shot
out
their
red
tongues
licking
up
the
withered
stalks
coiling
like
serpents
around
them
and
consuming
them
almost
instantaneously
filled
with
forebodings
my
companion
and
i
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
prairie
when
first
noticed
by
us
the
fire
had
extended
but
a
few
yards
on
each
side
of
the
we
had
chosen
for
our
camp
we
were
not
opposite
this
point
at
the
moment
having
gone
a
little
way
down
the
arroyo
we
ran
therefore
not
towards
the
camp
but
for
the
nearest
point
of
high
ground
in
order
to
discover
the
situation
of
our
friend
on
reaching
the
high
ground
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
locust
we
saw
to
our
astonishment
that
the
fire
had
already
spread
and
was
now
burning
forward
to
the
spot
where
we
had
climbed
up
we
had
only
a
moment
to
glance
outward
when
the
conflagration
hissing
and
crackling
as
it
passed
rolled
in
front
of
us
and
with
its
wall
of
flame
shut
off
our
view
of
the
prairie
but
that
glance
had
shown
us
all
and
filled
our
hearts
with
sorrow
and
dismay
it
revealed
the
situation
of
the
trapper
no
longer
a
situation
of
peril
but
as
we
supposed
of
certain
death
he
was
still
in
the
place
where
we
had
last
seen
him
he
had
evidently
made
no
attempt
to
escape
from
it
perhaps
the
knowledge
that
such
an
attempt
must
have
failed
and
hindered
him
from
making
it
the
reflection
that
he
might
as
well
die
where
he
stood
as
be
licked
up
by
the
flames
in
the
act
of
fleeing
from
them
had
bound
him
to
the
spot
wavering
and
undecided
oh
it
was
a
dread
sight
to
see
that
old
man
hardened
sinner
that
he
was
about
to
be
snatched
into
eternity
i
remember
his
wild
look
as
the
red
flame
roiling
between
us
shut
him
from
our
sight
we
saw
him
but
for
a
single
instant
his
head
and
shoulders
were
alone
visible
above
the
tall
weeds
he
made
no
sign
either
with
voice
or
arm
but
i
fancied
that
even
at
that
distance
i
could
read
his
glance
of
despair
was
there
no
hope
could
no
exertion
be
made
to
rescue
him
could
he
do
nothing
for
himself
was
there
no
chance
of
his
being
able
to
clear
a
circle
round
him
and
burn
off
a
space
before
the
line
of
fire
could
come
up
such
a
ruse
has
often
availed
but
no
never
in
such
a
ground
as
that
the
weeds
were
too
thick
and
tall
it
could
not
be
done
garey
said
it
could
not
be
done
there
was
no
hope
then
old
trapper
was
chapter
twenty
eight
rube
roasted
alive
doomed
beyond
doubt
doomed
to
quick
awful
and
certain
death
was
the
earless
trapper
in
five
minutes
more
he
must
perish
the
wall
of
flame
moving
faster
than
charging
cavalry
would
soon
envelope
him
and
surer
than
the
carbine
volley
or
the
keen
was
the
death
borne
forward
upon
the
wings
of
that
hissing
crackling
cohort
of
fire
here
and
there
tall
jets
shooting
suddenly
upward
stalked
far
in
advance
of
the
main
line
fiery
giants
with
red
arms
stretched
forth
as
if
eager
to
grasp
their
victim
already
their
hot
breath
was
upon
him
another
minute
and
he
must
perish
in
a
sort
of
stupor
we
stood
garey
and
i
watching
the
advance
of
the
flames
neither
of
us
uttered
a
word
painful
emotions
prevented
speech
both
our
hearts
were
beating
audibly
mine
was
bitterly
wrung
but
i
knew
that
the
heart
of
my
companion
was
enduring
the
very
acme
of
anguish
i
glanced
upward
to
his
face
his
eye
was
fixed
and
looked
steadfastly
in
one
direction
as
though
it
would
pierce
the
sheet
of
flame
that
rolled
farther
and
farther
from
where
we
stood
and
nearer
to
the
fatal
spot
the
expression
of
garey
eye
was
fearful
to
behold
it
was
a
look
of
concentrated
agony
a
single
tear
had
escaped
from
it
and
was
rolling
down
the
rude
cheek
little
used
to
such
bedewing
the
broad
chest
was
heaving
in
short
quick
spasms
and
it
was
evident
the
man
was
struggling
with
his
breath
he
was
listening
through
all
this
intensity
of
gaze
listening
for
the
of
his
old
comrade
his
not
long
was
the
suspense
though
there
was
no
shriek
no
cry
of
human
voice
to
indicate
the
crisis
if
any
arose
it
was
not
heard
by
us
it
could
not
have
been
it
would
have
been
drowned
amid
the
roar
of
the
flames
and
the
crackling
of
the
hollow
culms
whose
gases
set
free
by
the
fire
sounded
like
the
continuous
rolling
of
musketry
no
fell
upon
our
ears
but
for
all
that
we
were
satisfied
that
the
drama
had
reached
its
the
unfortunate
trapper
had
been
roasted
alive
already
the
flames
had
passed
over
the
spot
where
we
had
last
seen
him
far
beyond
leaving
the
ground
charred
and
black
behind
them
though
the
smoke
hindered
our
of
the
plain
we
knew
that
the
climax
had
passed
the
hapless
victim
had
succumbed
and
it
remained
only
to
look
for
his
bones
among
the
smouldering
ashes
up
to
this
moment
garey
had
stood
in
a
fixed
attitude
silent
and
rigid
as
a
statue
it
was
not
hope
that
had
held
him
thus
he
had
entertained
no
such
feeling
from
the
first
it
was
rather
a
paralysis
produced
by
despair
now
that
the
crisis
was
over
and
he
felt
certain
that
his
comrade
had
perished
his
muscles
so
long
held
in
tension
suddenly
relaxed
his
arms
fell
loosely
to
his
sides
the
tears
chased
each
other
over
his
cheeks
his
head
reclined
forward
and
in
a
hoarse
husky
voice
he
exclaimed
o
god
he
rubbed
out
rubbed
out
we
seed
the
last
o
poor
old
rube
my
sorrow
though
perhaps
not
so
keen
as
that
of
my
companion
was
nevertheless
sufficiently
painful
i
knew
the
earless
trapper
well
had
been
his
associate
under
strange
circumstances
amid
scenes
of
danger
that
draw
men
hearts
more
closely
together
than
any
phrases
of
flattery
or
compliment
more
than
once
had
i
seen
him
tried
in
the
hour
of
peril
and
i
knew
that
notwithstanding
the
wildness
and
eccentricity
of
his
character
of
his
crimes
i
might
add
his
heart
ill
directed
by
early
education
ill
guided
by
was
still
rife
with
many
virtues
many
proofs
of
this
could
i
recall
and
i
confess
that
a
feeling
akin
to
friendship
had
sprung
up
between
myself
and
this
singular
man
between
him
and
garey
the
ties
were
still
stronger
long
and
inseparable
companionship
years
of
participation
in
a
life
of
hardships
and
perils
like
thoughts
and
habitudes
though
perhaps
dispositions
age
and
characters
a
good
deal
unlike
all
had
combined
to
unite
the
two
in
a
firm
bond
of
friendship
to
use
their
own
expressive
phrase
they
to
each
other
no
wonder
then
that
the
look
with
which
the
young
trapper
regarded
that
black
plain
was
one
of
indescribable
anguish
to
his
mournful
speech
i
made
no
reply
what
could
i
have
said
i
could
not
offer
consolation
i
was
grieving
as
well
as
he
my
silence
was
but
an
assent
to
his
sad
soliloquy
after
a
moment
he
continued
his
voice
still
tremulous
with
sorrow
come
commarade
it
are
no
use
our
cryin
like
a
kupple
o
squaws
with
his
large
finger
he
dashed
the
tears
aside
as
if
ashamed
of
having
shed
them
it
are
all
over
now
he
continued
let
look
arter
his
bones
that
is
if
thar
anythin
left
o
and
gie
christyun
burial
come
we
caught
our
horses
and
mounting
rode
off
over
the
burnt
ground
the
hoofs
of
the
animals
tossed
up
the
smouldering
ashes
as
we
advanced
the
hot
red
cinders
causing
them
to
prance
the
smoke
pained
our
eyes
and
prevented
us
from
seeing
far
ahead
but
we
guided
ourselves
as
well
as
we
could
towards
the
point
where
we
had
last
seen
the
trapper
and
where
we
expected
to
find
his
remains
on
nearing
the
spot
our
eyes
fell
upon
a
dark
mass
that
lay
upon
the
plain
but
it
appeared
much
larger
than
the
body
of
a
man
we
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
until
within
a
few
feet
of
it
and
even
then
it
was
difficult
to
recognise
it
as
the
carcass
of
a
buffalo
though
truly
in
reality
it
was
it
was
no
doubt
the
game
which
the
hunter
had
killed
it
rested
as
it
had
fallen
as
these
animals
usually
fall
upon
the
breast
with
legs
widely
spread
and
humped
shoulders
upward
we
could
perceive
that
the
unfortunate
man
had
nearly
finished
skinning
it
for
the
hide
parted
along
the
spine
had
been
removed
from
the
back
and
sides
and
with
the
fleshy
side
turned
outward
was
hanging
to
the
ground
so
as
to
conceal
the
lower
half
of
the
carcass
the
whole
surface
was
burnt
to
the
colour
of
charcoal
but
where
were
the
remains
of
the
hunter
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
near
the
spot
the
smoke
had
now
cleared
away
sufficiently
to
enable
us
to
observe
the
ground
for
several
hundred
yards
around
us
an
object
of
small
dimensions
could
have
been
distinguished
upon
the
now
bare
surface
but
none
was
seen
yes
a
mass
lay
close
to
the
carcass
which
drew
our
attention
for
a
moment
but
on
riding
up
to
it
we
perceived
that
it
was
the
stomach
and
intestines
of
the
buffalo
black
and
half
broiled
but
where
were
the
bones
of
rube
had
he
got
away
from
the
spot
and
perished
elsewhere
we
glanced
towards
the
fire
still
raging
on
the
distant
plain
no
it
was
not
probable
he
had
moved
thence
by
the
last
look
we
had
obtained
of
him
he
did
not
appear
to
be
making
any
effort
to
escape
and
he
could
scarcely
have
gone
a
hundred
yards
before
the
flames
swept
over
the
spot
and
must
have
enveloped
him
how
then
were
his
bones
entirely
consumed
calcined
reduced
to
ashes
the
lean
withered
body
of
the
old
favoured
such
a
supposition
and
we
began
seriously
to
entertain
it
for
in
no
other
way
could
we
account
for
the
total
absence
of
all
remains
for
some
moments
we
sat
in
our
saddles
under
the
influence
of
strange
emotions
but
without
exchanging
a
word
we
scanned
the
black
plain
round
and
round
the
smoke
no
longer
hindered
our
view
of
the
ground
in
the
there
is
no
grassy
turf
and
the
dry
herbaceous
stems
of
the
annuals
had
burned
out
with
the
rapidity
of
blazing
flax
so
that
nothing
was
left
to
cause
a
smoke
the
fire
was
red
or
dead
in
an
instant
we
could
see
clear
enough
all
the
surface
of
the
ground
but
nothing
that
resembled
the
remains
of
a
human
being
no
said
garey
with
a
sigh
poor
old
rube
the
classed

burned

a
voice
that
caused
both
of

to
start
in
our
saddles
as
if
it
had
been
rube
ghost
that
addressed
us

the
voice

out
o
this

to
our
astonishment
the
pendent
hide
of
the
buffalo
was
raised
by
an
invisible
hand
and
underneath
appeared
protruding
through
a
hole
in
the
side
of
the
carcass
the
unmistakable
physiognomy
of
the
earless
trapper
there
was
something
so
ludicrous
in
the
apparition
that
the
sight
of
it
combined
with
the
joyful
reaction
of
our
feelings
sent
both
garey
and
myself
into
convulsions
of
laughter
the
young
trapper
lay
back
in
the
saddle
to
give
freer
play
to
his
lungs
and
his
loud
cachinnations
varied
at
intervals
by
savage
yells
caused
our
horses
to
dance
about
as
if
they
anticipated
an
onslaught
of
indians
at
first
i
could
detect
a
significant
smile
at
the
angles
formed
by
rube
thin
lips
but
this
disappeared
as
the
laughter
continued
too
long
for
his
patience

i
garey
now
leaped
from
his
horse
and
taking
hold
of
his
comrade
by
the
claws
drew
him
out
of
his
singular
but
the
appearance
of
the
old
trapper
as
he
stood
erect
red
reeking
and
greasy
was
so
supremely
ludicrous
that
both
garey
and
i
were
driven
off
into
a
fresh
fit
of
laughter
which
lasted
for
several
minutes
rube
once
released
from
his
uncomfortable
situation
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
our
mirth
but
stooping
down
drew
out
his
long
rifle
from
where
he
had
secured
it
under
the
hanging
skin
and
after
having
examined
the
piece
to
see
that
no
harm
had
come
to
it
he
laid
it
gently
across
the
horns
of
the
bull
then
taking
the
bowie
from
his
belt
he
quietly
proceeded
with
the
skinning
of
the
buffalo
as
if
nothing
had
happened
to
interrupt
the
operation
meanwhile
garey
and
i
had
laughed
ourselves
hoarse
and
moreover
were
brimful
of
curiosity
to
know
the
particulars
of
rube
adventure
but
for
some
time
he
fought
shy
of
our
queries
and
pretended
to
be
miffed
at
the
manner
in
which
we
had
him
to
again
it
was
all
pretence
however
as
garey
well
knew
and
the
latter
having
thrust
into
his
comrade
hand
the
gourd
still
containing
a
small
drop
of
soon
conciliated
him
and
after
a
little
more
coaxing
the
old
trapper
condescended
to
give
us
the
details
of
his
curious
escapade

after

of
seasoned
with

appetites

washed
down
by
a
cup
of

from

we
saddled
up
and
headed
for
a

just
visible
over
the

my

knew
the
landmark
well
it
lay
directly
in

route
we
should

near

would

us

sight
of
the
rancheria
from
the
roof
of
the
alcalde
house
i
had
frequently
noticed
it
outlined
against
the
horizon
in
a
direction
from
the
village
in
clear
weather
only
was
it
visible
struck
with
the
singularity
of
this
i
had
longed
to
examine
it
and
had
even
projected
a
visit
to
it
but
circumstances
had
prevented
me
from
carrying
out
my
intention
i
was
at
length
to
have
the
pleasure
of
a
nearer
acquaintance
with
it
i
have
called
it
singular
most
isolated
hills
are
conical
or
this
one
differed
from
the
usual
configuration
hence
its
singularity
it
presented
the
appearance
of
a
huge
box
set
upon
the
prairie
not
unlike
that
rare
formation
the
cofre
which
crowns
the
summit
of
the
mountain
perote
its
sides
in
the
distance
appeared
perfectly
vertical
and
its
top
horizontal
as
the
plain
on
which
it
rested
as
we
drew
nearer
i
could
perceive
by
the
dark
band
along
its
crest
that
it
was
covered
with
a
growth
of
timber
this
was
the
more
readily
observed
from
contrast
with
the
perpendicular
sides
which
were
almost
of
a
snowy
whiteness
on
account
of
the
gypsum
chalk
or
milky
quartz
of
which
the
rock
was
composed
the
most
peculiar
feature
of
the
mound
was
perhaps
its
apparently
regular
form
a
perfect
parallelopipedon
but
it
was
striking
in
other
respects
its
sides
glistened
fantastically
under
the
rays
of
the
sun
as
though
it
were
studded
with
settings
of
glass
this
however
was
easily
accounted
for
and
i
knew
that
the
sparkling
effect
was
produced
by
plates
of
mica
or
selenite
that
entered
into
the
composition
of
the
rock
i
had
seen
large
mountains
that
presented
a
similar
appearance
more
than
one
such
exist
in
the
great
american
saara
in
whose
glittering
cliffs
viewed
from
afar
may
be
found
the
origin
of
that
wild
chimera
the
of
although
neither
a
mountain
of
gold
nor
silver
the
mound
in
question
was
an
object
of
rare
interest
a
very
enchanted
castle
it
did
appear
and
it
was
difficult
to
assign
its
formation
to
nature
alone
human
agency
one
could
not
help
fancying
must
have
had
something
to
do
in
piling
up
a
structure
so
regular
and
compact
but
he
who
has
travelled
over
much
of
the
earth
surface
will
have
met
with
many
freaks
of
nature
exhibiting
like
appearance
of
design
in
her
world
of
inorganic
matter
it
was
in
fact
one
of
those
formations
of
which
many
are
met
with
in
the
of
america
known
in
spanish
phraseology
as
this
name
is
given
to
them
in
allusion
to
the
flat
tops
which
distinguish
them
from
other
elevated
summits
sometimes
one
of
these
mesas
is
found
hundreds
of
miles
from
any
similar
eminence
more
frequently
a
number
of
them
stand
near
each
other
like
truncated
cones
the
summits
of
all
being
on
the
same
level
and
often
covered
with
a
vegetation
differing
materially
from
that
of
the
surrounding
plains
geologists
have
affirmed
that
these
are
the
ancient
level
of
the
plains
themselves
and
that
all
around
and
intervening
between
them
has
either
sunk
or
submitted
to
the
degradation
of
water
it
is
a
vague
explanation
and
scarcely
satisfies
the
speculative
mind
the
of
mexico
is
still
a
geological
puzzle
as
we
approached
this
singular
object
i
could
not
help
regarding
it
with
a
degree
of
curiosity
i
had
seen
mesa
heights
before
in
the
mauvaise
terre
upon
the
missouri
in
the
navajo
country
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
along
the
edges
of
the
llano
estacado
which
of
itself
is
a
vast
mesa
the
mound
before
us
was
peculiar
from
its
very
regular
form
and
the
sparkling
sheen
of
its
cliffs
its
complete
isolation
moreover
added
to
the
effect
for
no
other
eminence
appeared
in
sight
the
low
hills
that
bordered
the
rio
grande
could
barely
be
distinguished
in
the
distance
on
getting
nearer
to
it
its
character
became
somewhat
altered
the
square
form
appeared
less
regular
and
it
was
then
perceived
that
the
parallelopipedon
was
not
perfect
slight
ledges
could
be
traced
traversing
the
face
of
its
cliffs
and
here
and
there
the
rectangular
lines
were
broken
to
the
eye
nature
after
all
had
not
been
so
exact
in
her
architecture
yet
with
every
deduction
it
was
a
singular
structure
to
look
upon
not
the
less
so
that
its
summit
was
inaccessible
to
human
foot
a
precipice
fifty
yards
sheer
fronted
outward
on
all
sides
no
one
had
ever
scaled
this
precipice
so
alleged
my
companions
who
were
well
acquainted
with
the
locality
we
had
approached
within
less
than
a
mile
of
its
base
our
conversation
had
dropped
at
least
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
my
thoughts
were
occupied
with
the
mound
and
my
eyes
wandering
over
its
outlines
i
was
endeavouring
to
make
out
the
character
of
the
vegetation
which
seemed
to
flourish
luxuriantly
on
its
summit
the
dark
foliage
was
evidently
that
of
some
species
of
acicular
trees
perhaps
the
common
red
cedar
but
there
were
others
of
lighter
hue
in
all
likelihood
the
pines
with
edible
cones
peculiar
to
this
region
i
noticed
also
growing
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
yuccas
and
aloes
whose
radiating
blades
stretching
out
curved
gracefully
over
the
white
rock
forms
of
cactus
too
were
apparent
and
several
plants
of
the
great
rose
high
above
the
cliff
like
gigantic
candelabra
strange
objects
in
such
a
situation
my
companions
seemed
to
have
no
eyes
for
these
rare
vegetable
beauties
i
could
hear
them
at
intervals
engaged
in
conversation
but
the
subject
had
no
reference
to
the
scene
and
i
paid
little
attention
to
what
they
were
saying
all
at
once
i
was
startled
by
the
voice
of
garey
giving
utterance
to
the
emphatic
announcement
injuns
by
god
indians
where
the
interrogation
as
it
escaped
my
lips
was
half
involuntary
and
needed
no
reply
garey
glance
guided
me
and
following
its
direction
i
observed
a
string
of
horsemen
just
debouching
from
behind
the
mesa
and
spurring
forward
upon
the
plain
both
my
companions
had
drawn
bridle
and
halted
i
followed
their
example
and
all
three
of
us
sat
in
our
saddles
scanning
this
sudden
apparition
of
mounted
men
a
dozen
had
now
cleared
themselves
from
behind
the
mesa
and
were
riding
towards
us
we
were
yet
nearly
a
mile
from
them
and
at
that
distance
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
a
white
man
from
an
indian
i
should
rather
say
impossible
even
at
half
the
distance
the
oldest
are
sometimes
puzzled
the
garments
are
often
not
very
dissimilar
and
and
dust
confound
the
complexions
although
garey
at
first
sight
of
them
had
pronounced
the
horsemen
to
be
indians
the
most
probable
supposition
under
the
circumstances
it
was
but
a
random
conjecture
and
for
some
time
we
remained
in
doubt
if
they
injuns
suggested
garey
they
comanche
an
if
thur
kimanch
added
rube
with
ominous
emphasis

to

counsel
was
instantly
followed
necessity
quickened
our
precautions
all
of
us
well
knew
that
should
the
approaching
horsemen
turn
out
to
be
comanches
we
had
no
alternative
but
fight
this
warlike
nation
occupies
the
whole
western
area
of
texas
ranging
from
the
rio
grande
on
the
south
to
the
arkansas
on
the
north
they
are
with
their
kindred
tribes
the
most
powerful
indian
alliance
on
the
continent
they
affect
the
ownership
of
all
styling
themselves
its
lords
though
their
sovereignty
towards
the
north
is
successfully
disputed
by
the
pawnees
sioux
blackfeet
and
others
as
warlike
as
they
from
the
earliest
times
they
have
been
the
of
the
texan
settler
and
a
detailed
account
of
their
forays
and
pillaging
expeditions
would
fill
a
score
of
volumes
but
from
these
they
have
not
gone
back
unscathed
the
reprisals
have
outnumbered
the
assaults
and
the
rifle
of
the
has
done
its
work
of
vengeance
in
mexico
they
have
found
less
puissant
defenders
of
the
hearth
and
home
and
into
the
provinces
of
that
unhappy
country
the
comanches
have
been
for
the
last
in
the
habit
of
making
an
annual
expedition
of
war
and
plunder
in
fact
plunder
has
become
the
better
part
of
their
subsistence
as
they
usually
return
from
these
rieving
incursions
laden
with
spoil
and
carrying
with
them
vast
droves
of
horses
mules
horned
cattle
and
for
a
short
time
these
dusky
freebooters
were
at
peace
with
the
colonists
of
texas
it
was
but
a
temporary
armistice
brought
about
by
houston
but
lamar
administration
of
a
less
pacific
character
succeeded
and
the
settlers
were
again
embroiled
with
the
indians
war
to
the
knife
was
declared
and
carried
on
red
and
white
killed
each
other
on
sight
when
two
men
met
upon
the
prairie
the
colour
of
the
skin
determined
the
relations
between
them
if
they
differed
in
this
the
were
enemies
without
parley
and
to
kill
the
other
was
the
first
thought
of
each
the
was
the
custom
of
the
hour
if
the
rancour
could
possibly
have
been
augmented
an
incident
had
just
transpired
calculated
to
produce
that
effect
a
band
of
comanche
warriors
had
offered
their
services
to
the
of
the
american
army
they
held
the
following
language
let
us
fight
on
your
side
we
have
no
quarrel
with
you
you
are
warriors
we
know
it
and
respect
you
we
fight
against
the
cowardly
mexicans
who
robbed
us
of
our
country
fight
for
these
words
uttered
along
the
whole
northern
frontier
of
mexico
are
full
of
strange
import
the
american
commander
prudently
declined
the
comanche
alliance
and
the
result
was
the
bitter
war
in
which
as
already
noticed
we
were
now
engaged
if
then
the
approaching
horsemen
were
indians
of
the
comanche
tribe
rube
forecast
was
correct
we
had
got
to
fight
with
this
understanding
we
lost
no
time
in
putting
ourselves
in
an
attitude
of
defence
hastily
dismounting
and
sheltering
our
bodies
behind
those
of
our
horses
we
awaited
the
approach
of
the
band
chapter
thirty
guerrilleros
the
manoeuvre
had
occupied
only
a
few
seconds
of
time
and
the
horsemen
were
yet
distant
they
had
thrown
themselves
into
a
formation
and
this
movement
took
us
by
surprise
the
tactics
were
not
indian
comanches
never
march
in
double
file
the
horsemen
could
not
be
indians
who
then
a
sudden
hope
crossed
my
mind
that
it
might
be
a
party
of
my
own
people
out
in
search
of
me
by
twos
was
our
favourite
and
habitual
order
of
march
but
no
the
long
lances
and
streaming
pennons
at
once
dissipated
the
hope
there
was
not
a
lance
in
the
american
army
they
could
not
be
rangers
comanches
on
the
would
have
been
armed
with
the
lance
but
clearly
they
were
comanches
wagh
exclaimed

after
eyeing
them
intently

added
raising
his

thur
a

thet
what
they
ur
all
three
of
us
had
arrived
simultaneously
at
the
same
conviction
the
horsemen
were
mexicans
it
was
no
great
source
of
rejoicing
to
know
this
and
the
knowledge
produced
no
change
in
our
defensive
attitude
we
well
knew
that
a
band
of
mexicans
armed
as
these
were
could
not
be
other
than
a
hostile
party
and
bitter
too
in
their
hostility
for
several
weeks
past
the
had
been
waged
with
dire
vengeance
the
neutral
ground
had
been
the
scene
of
reprisals
and
terrible
retaliations
on
one
side
had
been
attacked
and
captured
harmless
teamsters
murdered
or
mutilated
whilst
still
alive
i
saw
one
with
his
arms
cut
off
by
the
his
heart
taken
out
and
thrust
between
his
teeth
he
was
dead
but
another
whom
i
saw
still
lived
with
the
cross
deeply
gashed
upon
his
breast
on
his
brow
upon
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
the
palms
of
his
hands
a
horrid
spectacle
to
behold
on
the
other
side
ranchos
had
been
ransacked
and
ruined
villages
given
to
the
flames
and
men
on
mere
suspicion
shot
down
upon
the
spot
or
hanged
upon
the
nearest
tree
such
a
character
had
the
war
assumed
and
under
these
circumstances
we
knew
that
the
approaching
horsemen
were
our
deadly
foes
beyond
a
doubt
it
was
either
a
of
mexican
lancers
a
or
a
band
of
robbers
during
the
war
the
two
last
were
nearly
synonymous
and
the
first
not
unfrequently
partook
of
the
character
of
both
one
thing
that
puzzled
us
what
could
any
of
the
three
be
doing
in
that
quarter
the
neutral
ground
the
scene
of
operations
lay
between
the
two
armies
and
we
were
now
far
remote
from
it
in
fact
altogether
away
from
the
settlements
what
could
have
brought
lancers
guerrilleros
or
robbers
out
upon
the
plains
there
was
no
in
that
quarter
for
any
of
these
gentry
neither
an
american
force
to
be
attacked
nor
a
traveller
to
be
plundered
my
own
troop
was
the
extreme
in
this
direction
and
it
was
full
ten
miles
off
the
only
thing
likely
to
be
met
with
near
the
mesa
would
be
a
of
comanches
and
we
knew
the
mexicans
well
enough
to
be
convinced
that
whether
soldiers
or
freebooters
they
were
in
search
of
that
such
reflections
made
in
time
occurred
to
us
as
we
scanned
the
advancing
troop
up
to
this
moment
they
had
ridden
directly
towards
us
and
were
now
nearly
in
a
line
between
us
and
the
mesa
on
getting
within
about
of
our
position
they
turned
sharply
towards
the
west
and
rode
as
if
to
make
round
to
our
rear
this
manoeuvre
of
course
placed
us
upon
their
flank
and
now
outlined
against
the
sky
we
could
distinctly
trace
their
forms
and
note
their
habiliments
and
armour
nearly
all
wore
sombreros
with
jacket
sash
and
calzoneros
they
carried
lances
lazoes
and
carbines
or
we
could
distinguish
sabres
and
the
universal
weapon
of
the
mexican
ranchero
they
could
not
be
drilled
troops
their
costumes
as
well
as
a
certain
irregularity
in
their
manoeuvring
forbade
this
supposition
their
lances
moreover
were
borne
in
all
sorts
of
ways
some
couched
some
resting
in
the
stirrup
and
held
correctly
while
others
were
carried
over
the
shoulder
like
a
firelock
no
they
could
not
be
a
troop
of
regulars
they
were
either
or
true
after
riding
nearly
a
round
still
keeping
at
the
same
distance
the
troop
suddenly
made
front
towards
as
and
halted
we
had
been
puzzled
by
their
going
round
we
could
not
divine
their
object
in
so
doing
it
could
not
be
to
cut
off
our
retreat
the
timber
in
the
back
direction
was
miles
off
had
it
been
near
enough
we
should
certainly
have
retreated
to
it
long
before
but
we
knew
it
was
too
distant
rube
and
his
old
mare
would
have
been
overtaken
by
our
enemies
long
ere
we
could
have
gained
the
woods
we
knew
this
and
therefore
did
not
think
of
making
the
attempt
on
the
other
side
was
the
which
by
their
late
movement
had
been
left
open
to
us
it
was
but
a
off
and
perhaps
by
making
a
dash
we
might
have
reached
it
but
not
a
tree
grew
near
it
except
those
on
its
summit
and
its
rocky
wall
apparently
offered
no
advantage
to
us
any
more
than
the
open
plain
the
enemy
seemed
to
be
aware
of
this
else
they
would
not
have
ridden
round
and
by
so
doing
left
the
way
clear
until
the
moment
of
their
halt
therefore
we
remained
ignorant
of
their
motive
in
moving
to
our
rear
it
was
explained
their
object
was
evident
to
all
of
us
they
had
halted
between
us
and
the
sun
it
was
a
cunning
manoeuvre
worthy
of
a
of
indians
and
told
us
we
had
no
common
enemy
to
deal
with
by
approaching
us
from
that
direction
they
would
have
a
decided
advantage
our
aim
would
be
spoiled
by
the
sun
now
low
down
upon
the
horizon
and
gleaming
right
in
our
eyes
my
companions
were
wroth
at
the
trick
that
had
been
thus
played
so
adroitly
though
we
could
not
have
hindered
it
even
if
forewarned
of
their
intention
we
were
allowed
but
little
time
to
reflect
upon
the
matter
we
saw
by
the
movements
of
the
horsemen
that
they
were
preparing
to
charge
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
leader
mounted
upon
a
larger
horse
than
any
of
the
rest
was
addressing
them
he
rode
along
the
line
speaking
in
a
loud
tone
and
gesticulating
violently
he
was
answered
with
which
we
could
plainly
hear
every
moment
we
looked
to
see
them
gallop
forward
we
knew
there
was
no
alternative
but
fight
or
surrender
though
not
one
of
us
entertained
an
idea
of
the
latter
for
myself
i
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
turning
my
pistol
to
my
own
head
my
uniform
tattered
as
it
was
would
easily
reveal
my
character
to
the
enemy
and
if
captured
i
knew
that
i
should
be
hung
or
perhaps
in
the
absence
of
trees
shot
down
upon
the
spot
my
comrades
had
reasons
for
knowing
that
shrift
would
be
equally
short
neither
thought
for
a
moment
of
tamely
yielding
no
emphatically
pronounced

responded
garey
without
the
slightest
show
of
excitement
better
not
come
too
near
telling
thar
bisness
i
see
one
saddle
that
i
empy
the
minnit
they
pass
yon

and
the
speaker
indicated
a
bunch
of
the
plant
that
grew
some
two
hundred
paces
off
in
the
direction
of
the
horsemen
the
reckless
talk
of
the
old
trapper
with
the
contrasted
cool
bearing
of
his
younger
companion
had
fixed
my
nerves
fully
at
the
first
sight
of
so
many
adversaries
i
was
not
without
some
misgivings
in
truth
i
felt
fear
such
odds
against
us
four
to
one
was
fair
cause
for
apprehension
but
it
was
not
my
first
fight
against
large
odds
both
indian
and
mexican
and
on
that
account
i
regarded
it
the
less
seriously
notwithstanding
the
superiority
of
our
enemy
in
numbers
i
knew
we
were
not
so
unequal
unless
shot
down
by
the
first
volley
of
their
carbines
and
escopettes
each
of
our
three
rifles
was
sure
of
its
man
i
had
confidence
in
my
own
weapon
and
a
still
more
perfect
reliance
on
those
of
my
comrades
they
were
men
that
never
missed
men
who
never
fired
a
random
shot
never
drew
trigger
till
their
aim
was
sure
i
felt
certain
therefore
that
should
the
horsemen
charge
upon
us
only
of
the
twelve
would
ever
get
within
of
us
and
for
that
distance
we
were
well
prepared
i
carried
in
my
belt
a
revolver
one
of
colt
best
garey
had
another
a
present
i
had
made
him
many
years
before
and
rube
was
armed
with
a
pair
of
stout
likely
enough
to
do
good
service
shots
wid
our
bowies
to
fall
back
upon
cried
garey
triumphantly
as
we
finished
a
hasty
survey
of
our
arms
as
yet
the
enemy
did
not
advance
notwithstanding
their
and
ejaculations
they
appeared
to
hesitate
about
charging
their
leader
and
another
a
lieutenant
perhaps
were
still
seen
riding
along
their
line
as
if
animating
them
by
further
speech
giving
them
orders
how
to
act
meanwhile
had
not
been
idle
we
had
to
receive
the
charge
you
may
smile
but
such
was
in
reality
the
case
we
had
formed
square
with
our
horses
there
were
four
of
them
for
the
counted
one
garey
who
like
a
comanche
had
broken
him
at
our
last
camp
and
he
was
now
perfectly
tractable
the
shake
of
a
lazo
rendered
him
docile
as
a
lamb
the
four
were
tied
head
to
head
and
croup
to
croup
and
each
formed
one
side
of
the
square
they
could
not
have
broken
it
even
under
a
charge
of
cavalry
bridles
must
be
untied
or
cut
and
lazoes
set
loose
before
that
could
be
destroyed
within
stood
we
fronting
our
foes
the
large
horse
of
garey
forming
our
barricade
towards
them
our
heads
and
feet
alone
visible
to
the
enemy
thus
did
we
await
their
onset
chapter
thirty
one
the
parley
another
chorus
of
announced
that
the
guerrilla
captain
had
finished
his
oration
and
that
the
attack
was
about
to
be
made
we
saw
the
chief
himself
with
one
or
two
others
advance
in
front
of
the
line
and
head
towards
us
as
if
intending
to
lead
the
charge
now

though
at
the
time
steadiness

my
heart
was
heaving
in
quick
pulsations
at
the
near
prospect
of
the
terrible
drama
about
to
be
enacted
at
this
moment
the
forward
fell
upon
our
ears
and
with
the
wild
notes
of
the
bugle
came
the
words
anda
dios
y
on
forward
god
and
guadalupe
in
an
instant
the
troop
was
in
motion
galloping
down
to
the
charge
they
had
not
made
many
stretches
before
their
line
became
broken
several
of
the
swiftest
or
most
courageous
having
forged

muttered
cautions
slowly
drawled
out
were
changed
to
an
exclamation
that
betokened
surprise
followed
by
a
long
low
whistle
of
the
same
import
the
cause
was
clear
the
guerrilleros
had
got
within
three
hundred
yards
of
us
still
going
at
a
gallop
but
we
could
perceive
that
their
pace
slackened
as
they
advanced
already
it
was
more
of
an
amble
than
the
forward
dash
of
an
earnest
charge
it
was
evident
they
had
no
stomach
for
the
business
now
that
they
were
near
enough
to
see
the
shining
barrels
and
black
hollow
tubes
of
our
levelled
rifles
garey
was
waiting
till
the
foremost
should
pass
the
for
by
that
he
had
calculated
the
range
of
his
rifle
another
moment
and
its
crack
would
have
been
heard
but
the
horseman
as
if
warned
by
instinct
seemed
to
divine
the
exact
limit
of
danger
before
reaching
the
bush
his
heart
failed
him
and
in
a
wavering
irresolute
manner
he
drew
bridle
and
halted
the
others
nothing
loath
followed
his
example
until
the
whole
troop
had
pulled
up
within
less
than
three
hundred
yards
of
the
muzzles
of
our
guns
cowed
by
god
shouted
rube
with
a
derisive
laugh
hulloo
continued
he
raising
his
voice
still
louder
and
addressing
the
halted
line
what
do
ee
want
anyhow
why
the
hell
do
ee
come
on
whether
rube
comical
interrogatory
was
understood
or
not
it
elicited
a
reply
somos
we
are
friends
shouted
back
the
leader
of
the
band
friends
be
damned
exclaimed
the
trapper
who
knew
enough
of
spanish
to
understand
the
signification
of
nice
friends
you
wagh
think
to
bamfoozle
us
keep
yur
distance
now
continued
he
raising
his
rifle
in
a
threatening
manner
as
a
movement
was
perceptible
among
the
horsemen

or
by
the
airthquake
i
plug

damn
sich
friends
as
you
the
leader
now
conversed
in
a
low
tone
with
his
lieutenant
and
some
new
design
seemed
to
be
discussed
between
them
a
change
of
tactics
was
evidently
devised
during
this
pause
in
the
action
after
a
while
the
chief
again
addressed
us
speaking
as
before
in
spanish
we
are
friends
said
he
we
mean
you
no
harm
to
prove
it
i
shall
order
my
men
to
fall
back
upon
the
prairie
while
my
lieutenant
unarmed
will
meet
one
of
you
on
the
neutral
ground
surely
you
can
have
no
objection
to
that
and
why
such
an
arrangement
inquired
garey
who
spoke
spanish
fluently
we
want
nothing
of
what
do
you
want
from
with
all
this
infernal
fuss
i
have
business
with
you
replied
the
mexican
and
sir
in
particular
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
i
do
wish
others
to
hear
as
he
said
this
the
speaker
turned
his
head
and
nodded
significantly
towards
his
own
following
he
was
candid
with
them
at
least
this
unexpected
dialogue
took
all
three
of
us
by
surprise
what
could
the
man
want
with
garey
the
latter
knew
nothing
of
him
had
never
as
he
declared
sot
eyes
on
the
niggur
afore
although
at
such
a
distance
with
the
sun
in
his
face
and
the
mexican
sombrero
slouched
as
it
was
garey
might
be
mistaken
it
might
be
some
one
whom
he
had
met
though
he
could
not
recall
him
to
mind
after
a
short
consultation
we
agreed
that
garey
should
accept
the
proposal
no
evil
could
result
from
it
none
that
we
could
think
of
garey
could
easily
get
back
before
any
attack
could
be
made
upon
him
and
rube
and
i
should
still
be
ready
to
protect
him
with
our
pieces
if
they
meditated
treachery
we
could
not
perceive
the
advantage
they
were
to
gain
from
the
proceeding
the
parley
therefore
was
accepted
and
the
conditions
arranged
with
due
caution
on
our
part
the
horsemen
with
the
exception
of
the
leader
and
his
lieutenant
were
to
ride
back
to
the
distance
of
the
leader
was
to
remain
where
he
was
and
halfway
between
him
and
us
garey
and
the
lieutenant
were
to
meet
both
of
them
on
foot
and
unarmed
at
an
order
from
their
chief
the
guerrilleros
fell
back
the
lieutenant
dismounted
laid
his
lance
along
the
ground
unbuckled
his
sabre
drew
the
pistols
from
his
belt
and
placing
them
beside
the
lance
advanced
towards
the
appointed
spot
garey
had
likewise
disarmed
himself
and
leaving
his
weapons
in
charge
of
rube
and
myself
stepped
forth
to
meet
the
mexican
in
another
minute
the
two
stood
face
to
face
and
the
parley
began
it
was
of
short
duration
the
speaking
which
appeared
to
be
principally
done
by
the
mexican
was
carried
on
in
a
low
tone
and
rube
and
i
saw
that
he
pointed
frequently
in
our
direction
as
if
we
were
the
subject
of
his
discourse
we
observed
that
his
harangue
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
garey
who
turning
round
at
the
same
instant
cried
out
to
us
in
english
hillow
rube
what
do
yer
think
the
skunk
wants
how
shed
i
know
replied
rube
what
do
want
why
he
wants
garey
voice
rose
louder
with
indignation
he
wants
us
to
give
up
the
an
sez
if
we
do
you
an
me
can
go
free
ha
ha
ha
and
the
young
trapper
ended
his
announcement
with
a
scornful
laugh
simultaneous
with
garey
laugh
i
could
hear
rube
utter
a
low
whistle
and
the
words
thet
how
the
stick
floats
and
then
raising
his
voice
he
called
out
an
what
answer
hev
you
gin
him
billee
i
hai
answered
him
yet
was
the
prompt
reply
but
hyar
the
answer
i
saw
garey
arm
raised
with
his
huge
fist
clenched
i
saw
it
descend
like
a
upon
the
face
of
the
mexican
who
under
the
blow
fell
heavily
to
the
earth
chapter
thirty
two
a
dead
shot
the
unexpected
closing
of
the
conference
elicited
an
angry
shout
from
the
mexican
horsemen
and
without
waiting
for
orders
they
galloped
up
to
their
chief
halting
at
they
fired
their
carbines
and
escopettes
but
their
bullets
cut
the
grass
far
in
front
of
us
and
one
or
two
that
hurtled
past
were
wide
of
the
mark
the
lieutenant
who
had
been
only
stunned
soon
recovered
his
legs
but
not
his
temper
his
wrath
overbalanced
his
prudence
else
the
moment
he
found
his
feet
he
would
have
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
his
horse
and
comrades
instead
of
doing
so
he
turned
full
front
towards
us
raised
his
arm
in
the
air
shook
his
clenched
fist
in
a
menacing
manner
accompanying
the
action
with
a
torrent
of
defiant
speech
of
what
he
said
we
understood
but
the
concluding
phrase
and
that
was
the
bitter
and
blasphemous
that
hissed
through
his
teeth
with
the
energetic
aspiration
of
rage
and
revenge
that
oath
was
the
last
word
he
ever
uttered
his
parting
breath
scarcely
carried
it
from
his
lips
ere
he
ceased
to
live
i
heard
the
fierce
word
and
almost
simultaneously
the
crack
of
a
rifle
fired
close
to
my
ear
i
saw
the
dust
puff
out
from
the
embroidered
spencer
of
the
mexican
and
directly
over
his
heart
i
saw
his
hand
pass
rapidly
to
the
spot
and
the
next
moment
i
saw
him
fall
forward
upon
his
face
without
a
groan
without
a
struggle
he
lay
as
he
had
fallen
spread
dead
and
motionless
upon
the
prairie
thur
now
an
damn
yur
carajo
cried
a
voice
at
my
shoulder
ee
for
me
agin
ye
skunk
thet
yur
wo
though
i
turned
involuntarily
to
the
speaker
it
was
not
for
an
explanation
of
course
it
was
rube
who
spoke
his
rifle
was
smoking
at
the
muzzle
and
he
was
proceeding
to
reload
it
woop
continued
he
uttering
his
wild
thet
shortens
thur
count
i
another

wagh
a

too
the

or
i

boys
he
continued
in
a
more
earnest
tone
do
fire
till
loaded
for
yur
lives
do
all
right
rube
cried
garey
who
hastily
passing
under
the
belly
of
his
horse
had
the
square
and
once
more
handled
his
rifle
all
right
old
boy
a
fear
we
wait
for
ye
somewhat
to
our
surprise
rube
was
allowed
ample
time
to
reload
and
our
three
barrels
once
more
protruded
over
the
shoulders
of
garey
horse
our
animals
still
held
their
respective
positions
three
of
them
were
too
well
used
to
such
scenes
to
be
startled
by
the
detonation
of
a
rifle
and
the
fourth
fastened
as
he
was
kept
his
place
perforce
i
say
to
our
surprise
we
were
allowed
time
to
get
into
our
old
for
we
had
expected
an
immediate
charge
from
the
guerrilla
vengeance
for
the
death
of
their
comrade
would
give
them
courage
enough
for
that
so
thought
we
but
we
were
mistaken
as
their
ire
only
vented
itself
in
fierce
yells
violent
gestures
and
ejaculations
they
had
now
clustered
around
their
chief
without
order
or
formation
though
they
seemed
to
pay
but
slight
regard
to
his
authority
some
appeared
to
be
urging
him
to
lead
them
on
others
came
galloping
nearer
and
fired
their
carbines
or
shook
their
lances
in
a
threatening
manner
but
one
and
all
were
careful
to
keep
outside
that
perilous
circle
whose
circumference
marked
the
range
of
our
rifles
they
seemed
even
less
inclined
for
close
quarters
than
ever
the
fate
of
their
comrade
had
awed
them
the
dead
man
lay
about
between
them
and
us
glittering
in
his
picturesque
habiliments
they
were
weaker
by
his
loss
for
not
only
had
he
been
one
of
their
leaders
but
one
of
their
best
men
they
saw
he
was
dead
though
none
had
dared
to
approach
him
they
knew
the
texan
rifle
of
old
these
spangled
heroes
they
knew
moreover
that
we
were
armed
with
revolvers
and
the
fame
of
this
terrible
weapon
had
been
already
carried
beyond
the
frontier
of
the
rio
grande
notwithstanding
all
that
men
of
our
race
under
similar
circumstances
would
have
charged
without
hesitation
so
too
would
men
of
theirs
three
centuries
ago
perhaps
in
that
band
was
an
alvarado
a
sandoval
a
diaz
or
de
soto
only
in
name
o
cortez
and
you
could
you
have
beheld
your
degenerate
descendants
and
yet
not
all
of
them
were
cowards
some
i
dare
say
were
brave
enough
for
there
brave
men
among
the
mexicans
a
few
were
evidently
willing
to
make
the
attack
but
they
wanted
combination
they
wanted
a
leader
he
who
acted
as
such
appeared
to
be
endowed
with
more
prudence
than
valour
meanwhile
we
kept
our
eyes
fixed
upon
them
listening
to
their
varied
cries
and
closely
watching
their
movements
in
perfect
coolness
we
regarded
them
at
least
so
much
can
i
say
for
my
comrades
though
life
or
death
rested
upon
the
issue
both
were
as
cool
at
that
moment
as
if
they
had
been
only
observing
the
movements
of
a
gang
of
buffaloes
there
was
no
sign
of
trepidation
hardly
a
symptom
of
excitement
visible
in
the
countenance
of
either
now
and
then
a
ejaculation
a
rapid
exchange
of
thought
relating
to
some
fresh
movement
of
the
enemy
alone
told
that
both
were
alive
to
the
peril
of
the
situation
i
can
not
affirm
that
i
shared
with
them
this
extreme
and
perfect
though
upon
my
nerves
less
indifferent
to
danger
their
example
had
its
effect
and
inspired
me
with
courage
sufficient
for
the
occasion
besides
i
drew
confidence
from
another
source
in
case
of
defeat
i
had
a
resource
unshared
by
my
companions
perhaps
unthought
of
by
them
trusting
to
the
matchless
speed
of
my
horse
as
a
last
resort
i
might
possibly
escape
i
could
have
ridden
off
at
that
moment
without
fear
of
being
overtaken
but
the
craven
thought
was
not
entertained
for
an
instant
by
my
honour
no
i
should
have
accepted
death
upon
the
spot
rather
than
desert
the
brave
men
who
stood
by
my
side
to
i
was
indebted
for
my
life
was
for
that
theirs
were
now
in
peril
and
from
the
first
moment
i
had
determined
to
stand
by
them
to
the
end
and
sell
my
blood
at
its
dearest
in
the
event
of
both
falling
before
me
it
would
then
be
time
enough
to
think
of
flight
even
this
contingency
had
the
effect
of
strengthening
my
courage
and
at
that
moment
i
viewed
the
vengeful
foe
with
a
coolness
and
freedom
from
fear
that
now
in
the
retrospect
surprises
me
during
the
interval
of
inaction
that
followed
i
was
cool
enough
to
reflect
upon
the
demand
which
the
guerrilla
leader
had
made
the
surrender
of
my
person
why
was
i
singled
out
we
were
all
enemies
alike
all
americans
or
texans
on
mexican
soil
and
armed
for
strife
why
did
they
want
alone
was
it
because
i
was
superior
in
rank
to
my
companions
but
how
knew
they
this
how
knew
they
i
was
a
ha
they
must
have
known
it
before
they
must
have
come
out
specially
in
search
of
me
a
light
flashed
suddenly
into
my
mind
a
suspicion
strong
almost
as
certainty
but
for
the
sun
glancing
in
my
eyes
i
might
have
earlier
obtained
an
explanation
of
the
mystery
i
drew
down
the
visor
of
my
stretching
it
to
its
full
extent
i
increased
the
shade
with
my
flattened
palms
and
from
under
them
strained
my
eyes
upon
the
leader
of
the
band
already
his
voice
while
in
conversation
with
garey
had
aroused
a
faint
recollection
within
me
i
had
heard
that
voice
only
once
but
i
thought
i
remembered
it
guided
by
my
suspicion
i
now
scrutinised
more
closely
the
countenance
of
the
man
fortunately
the
face
was
turned
towards
me
and
despite
the
dazzling
of
the
sunbeams
despite
the
slouched
sombrero
i
recognised
the
dark
features
of
rafael
ijurra
in
that
glance
i
comprehended
the
situation
he
it
was
who
wanted
the
there
was
doubt
no
longer
my
suspicion
was
a
certainty
but
with
the
next
throb
of
my
heart
rose
another
a
thousand
times
more
painful
a
suspicion
of
with
an
effort
i
stifled
my
emotions
a
movement
was
perceptible
among
the
guerrilleros
the
moment
of
action
had
arrived
chapter
thirty
three
a
though
our
enemies
were
once
more
in
motion
we
no
longer
anticipated
a
direct
attack
the
time
for
that
had
passed
the
fate
of
their
comrade
had
evidently
checked
their
ardour
and
too
much
shouting
and
bravado
had
cooled
rather
than
heightened
their
enthusiasm
we
could
tell
by
their
manoeuvring
that
some
new
mode
of
assault
had
been
planned
and
was
about
to
be
practised
cowardly
skunks
muttered
rube
they
hai
the
pluck
to
charge

who
ever
heerd
o

he
continued
in
a
more
serious
tone
what
do
think
it
be
billee
i
thinkin
old
boy
replied
garey
whose
keen
grey
eye
had
been
for
some
time
fixed
on
the
movements
of
the
guerrilla
i
thinkin

injun
fashion
yur

assented
rube
thet
thur
game
scalp
me
ef
look
yanner
thur
they
go
the
horsemen
were
no
longer
in
line
nor
formed
in
any
fashion
irregularly
grouped
they
exhibited
a
clump
upon
the
prairie
some
standing
still
others
in
motion
as
rube
uttered
the
last
words
one
of
them
was
seen
to
shoot
out
from
the
main
body
spurring
his
steed
into
a
gallop
as
he
parted
from
the
crowd
one
might
have
fancied
he
was
about
to
ride
off
from
the
ground
but
no
that
was
not
his
intention
when
he
had
made
stretches
over
the
plain
he
guided
his
horse
into
a
curve
evidently
with
the
design
of
riding
around
us
as
soon
as
he
had
gained
some
score
of
yards
from
the
troop
a
second
horseman
followed
repeating
the
manoeuvre
and
then
another
and
another
until
five
of
the
band
thus
deployed
galloped
round
us
in
circles
the
remaining
six
kept
their
ground
we
observed
that
the
five
had
left
their
lances
behind
them
and
carried
only
their
carbines
we
were
not
astonished
at
this
we
divined
the
intention
of
our
enemies
they
were
about
to
practise
an
old
a
stratagem
of
the
with
which
all
three
of
us
were
familiar
we
might
have
been
more
apprehensive
about
the
result
had
it
been
really
indians
who
were
going
to
practise
the
manoeuvre
since
in
an
attack
of
this
kind
the
bow
with
its
many
missiles
in
a
minute
is
far
more
dangerous
than
either
carbine
or
rifle
but
the
fact
that
our
assailants
understood
the
stratagem
told
us
we
were
opposed
to
men
who
had
seen
indian
fight
no
doubt
the
picked
men
of
the
frontier
and
to
defend
ourselves
would
require
all
the
courage
and
cunning
we
possessed
it
did
not
surprise
us
that
only
a
portion
of
the
band
galloped
out
to
effect
the
surround
there
was
design
in
that
and
we
knew
it
the
five
who
had
been
detached
were
to
wheel
round
us
in
circles
dash
at
intervals
within
range
fire
their
carbines
kill
some
of
our
horses
keep
us
distracted
and
if
possible
the
fire
of
our
rifles
this
purpose
effected
the
other
six
who
had
already
approached
as
near
as
was
safe
for
them
would
charge
forward
empty
their
guns
and
then
use
their
lazoes
with
effect
of
this
last
my
companions
had
more
dread
than
of
all
the
others
carried
by
our
foes
they
had
reason
they
knew
that
our
rifles
once
empty
the
lazo
could
be
used
beyond
and
by
such
men
with
far
surer
aim
than
either
carbine
or
escopette
we
were
allowed
but
scant
time
to
entertain
these
doubts
fears
and
conjectures
or
to
communicate
them
to
one
another
they
passed
before
us
like
the
lightning
flash
the
quicker
that
they
were
old
thoughts
things
familiar
from
experience
we
were
conscious
that
the
stratagem
of
our
enemy
had
increased
the
peril
of
our
situation
but
we
thought
not
yet
of
yielding
to
despair
in
an
instant
we
had
altered
our
relative
positions
the
three
of
us
no
longer
fronted
in
one
direction
but
stood
back
to
back
each
to
guard
the
third
of
the
circle
before
his
face
thus
stood
we
rifles
in
hand
the
five
horsemen
were
not
slow
in
the
execution
of
their
manoeuvre
once
or
twice
they
galloped
round
us
in
a
wide
circle
and
then
following
a
spiral
curve
drew
nearer
and
nearer
when
within
each
fired
his
piece
and
retreating
outward
upon
the
main
body
hastily
exchanged
his
empty
gun
for
one
that
was
loaded
and
galloped
back
as
before
in
the
first
volley
most
of
their
bullets
discharged
at
random
had
passed
over
our
heads
we
heard
them
hissing
in
the
air
high
above
us
one
however
had
been
better
aimed
and
struck
rube
mare
in
the
hip
causing
the
old
mustang
to
squeal
and
kick
violently
it
did
but
little
damage
though
it
was
an
earnest
of
what
we
might
expect
and
it
was
with
increased
apprehension
that
we
saw
the
horsemen
come
back
on
their
circling
career
you
will
wonder
why
we
did
not
return
their
fire
our
guns
carried
as
far
as
theirs
why
did
we
not
use
them
while
the
horsemen
were
within
range
not
one
of
the
three
of
us
thought
of
drawing
a
trigger
you
will
wonder
at
this
it
requires
explanation
know
then
that
the
five
men
who
galloped
round
us
were
five
of
the
best
horsemen
in
the
world
no
doubt
the
picked
riders
of
the
band
not
in
arabia
not
in
the
hippodromes
of
paris
or
london
could
they
have
found
their
superiors
perhaps
not
their
equals
for
these
men
literally
live
in
the
saddle
each
as
he
approached
the
dangerous
circle
covered
by
our
rifles
disappeared
the
body
of
his
a
boot
and
spur
over
the
hollow
of
the
deep
perhaps
a
hand
grasping
the
of
the
horse
were
all
of
the
rider
that
could
be
seen
presently
a
face
might
be
observed
suddenly
veiled
by
a
puff
of
smoke
from
the
carbine
and
then
ducked
instantly
out
of
sight
perhaps
the
barrel
of
the
piece
might
be
noticed
glancing
along
the
horse
counter
while
the
stream
of
fire
pouring
forth
told
that
the
rider
had
taken
aim
under
the
throat
of
his
steed
the
latter
all
the
while
going
at
full
gallop
during
these
manoeuvres
sharp
shots
as
my
comrades
were
and
fair
marksman
as
i
was
myself
there
was
no
instant
when
we
could
have
hit
any
one
of
the
five
horsemen
it
would
have
been
easier
to
have
brought
down
a
bird
upon
the
wing
their
horses
we
might
have
killed
or
crippled
but
that
would
not
have
repaid
us
for
the
risk
of
an
empty
rifle
we
dared
not
waste
a
bullet
on
the
horses
that
was
our
reason
for
reserving
our
fire
do
not
fancy
from
this
my
prolixity
of
explanation
that
were
so
slow
in
comprehending
all
these
points
no
we
understood
our
situation
well
enough
we
knew
that
to
discharge
our
pieces
even
though
a
horse
should
fall
to
every
shot
was
just
what
the
enemy
desired
that
was
the
main
object
of
their
but
we
were
too
well
used
to
the
wiles
of
indian
warfare
to
be
beguiled
by
so
shallow
an
artifice
words
of
caution
passed
between
us
and
we
stood
to
our
guns
with
as
much
patience
as
we
could
command
it
was
tempting
enough
provoking
i
should
rather
say
thus
to
be
fired
at
without
the
chance
of
returning
it
and
my
companions
notwithstanding
their
habitual
coolness
chafed
angrily
under
the
infliction
once
more
the
five
horsemen
came
galloping
around
us
and
discharged
their
pieces
as
before
but
this
time
with
more
effect
a
bullet
struck
garey
in
the
shoulder
tearing
away
a
patch
of
his
and
drawing
the
blood
while
another
went
whizzing
past
the
cheek
of
old
rube
creasing
his
catskin
cap
hooray
shouted
the
latter
clapping
his
hand
over
the
place
where
the
lead
had
wounded
him
clost
enough
thet
wur
cuss
me
eft
carried
away
one
o
my
ears
and
the
old
trapper
accompanied
the
remark
with
a
wild
reckless
laugh
the
rent
of
the
bullet
and
the
blood
upon
garey
shoulder
now
fell
under
his
eye
and
suddenly
changing
countenance
he
exclaimed
by
the
yur
hit

like

in

what
do
think
added
he
addressing
himself
to
me
just
then
an
idea
had
occurred
to
me
why
not
gallop
to
the
cliff
i
inquired
looking
toward
the
mesa
they
ca
surround
us
there
with
our
backs
to
the
rock
and
our
horses
in
front
of
us
we
may
defy
the
rabble
we
might
easily
reach
it
by
a
dash
scalp
me
ef
the
young
fellur
ai
right
cried
rube
interrupting
my
speech
it
the
very
idee
plum
centre
it
are
echoed
garey
it
are
we
hai
a
second
to
lose
they
be
round
us
again
in
a
squ
jump
look
yonder
this
conversation
had
occupied
but
a
few
seconds
of
time
it
occurred
just
after
the
five
horsemen
had
the
second
time
emptied
their
guns
and
galloped
back
to
exchange
them
before
they
could
return
to
deliver
a
third
fire
our
determination
was
taken
and
we
had
hastily
undone
the
fastenings
of
our
horses
and
were
ready
to
mount
this
we
accomplished
so
quietly
that
it
was
evident
the
enemy
had
not
perceived
us
and
therefore
entertained
no
suspicion
of
our
design
hence
the
road
towards
the
mesa
was
still
perfectly
open
to
us
in
another
minute
however
the
five
riders
would
have
been
circling
around
us
and
that
would
have
naturally
altered
our
situation
hurry
rube
cried
garey
hurry
man
and
let
be
off
keep
cool
billee
rejoined
rube
who
was
adjusting
the
bridle
of
garey
horse
plenty
o
time
i
they
ai
a
comin
yit
he
woo
ole
gal
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
the
mare
we
to
leave
you
ahint
a
bit
but
i
yu
turn
up
agin
they
wo
eat
ye
anyhow
so
do
be
skeeart
about
thet
ole
gal
now
billee
i
ready
it
was
time
for
the
riders
were
again
spurring
forward
to
surround
us
without
waiting
to
observe
further
we
all
three
leaped
simultaneously
on
horseback
and
plying
the
spur
deeply
shot
off
in
a
direct
line
of
the
mesa
a
glance
behind
showed
us
the
guerrilleros
the
whole
band
coming
in
full
tilt
after
us
while
their
cries
sounded
in
our
ears
to
our
satisfaction
we
saw
we
had
gained
ground
upon
them
our
sudden
start
having
taken
them
by
surprise
and
produced
in
their
ranks
a
momentary
hesitation
we
had
no
fear
of
being
able
to
reach
the
mesa
before
they
could
overtake
us
for
my
own
part
i
could
soon
have
ridden
out
of
sight
altogether
so
could
garey
mounted
on

them

ur
gettin

we
were
riding
directly
for
the
middle
of
the
mesa
whose
cliff
like
a
vast
wall
rose
up
from
the
level
plain
we
headed
for
its
central
part
as
though
we
expected
some
gate
to
open
in
the
rock
and
give
us
shelter
shouts
of
astonishment
could
be
heard
mingling
with
the
some
of
the
expressions
we
heard
distinctly
whither
go
they
do
they
intend
to
ride
up
the
cliff
bueno
bueno
van
en
la
good
they
are
going
into
the
trap
shouts
of
exultation
followed
as
they
saw
us
thus
voluntarily
placing
ourselves
in
a
position
from
which
retreat
appeared
impossible
they
had
been
apprehensive
on
our
first
galloping
off
that
we
might
be
mounted
on
swift
horses
and
meditated
escaping
by
speed
but
on
discovering
that
this
was
not
our
intention
cries
of
joyful
import
were
heard
and
as
we
approached
the
cliff
we
saw
them
deploying
behind
us
with
the
design
of
hemming
us
in
it
was
just
the
movement
we
had
anticipated
and
the
very
thing
we
desired
them
to
do
we
galloped
up
close
to
the
rocky
wall
before
drawing
bridle
then
suddenly
flinging
ourselves
to
the
ground
we
placed
our
backs
to
the
cliff
drew
our
horses
in
front
of
us
and
holding
the
bridles
in
our
teeth
raised
our
rifles
towards
the
foe
once
more
the
three
shining
tubes
were
levelled
promising
certain
death
to
the
first
who
should
approach
within
range
chapter
thirty
four
rube
charger
our
attitude
of
defence
thus
suddenly
assumed
produced
a
quick
effect
upon
our
pursuers
who
pulled
up
simultaneously
on
the
prairie
some
who
had
been
foremost
and
who
fancied
they
had
ridden
too
near
wheeled
round
and
galloped

we
at
once
perceived
the
advantage
of
our
new
position
we
could
all
three
show
front
wherever
the
enemy
threatened
there
was
no
longer
any
danger
of
their
practising
the
surround
the
behind
us
was
covered
by
the
mesa
and
that
could
not
be
scaled
we
had
only
to
guard
the
semicircle
in
front
in
fact
less
than
a
semicircle
for
we
now
perceived
that
the
place
was
a
sort
of
angle
formed
by
two
oblique
faces
of
the
cliff
the
walls
that
flanked
it
extended
three
hundred
yards
on
either
side
so
that
no
cover
commanded
our
position
for
defence
we
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
situation
gallop
round
as
they
might
the
guerrilleros
would
always
find
us
with
our
teeth
towards
them
we
saw
our
advantage
at
a
glance
neither
were
our
enemies
slow
to
perceive
it
and
their
exulting
shouts
changed
to
exclamations
that
betokened
their
disappointment
almost
as
suddenly
their
tone
again
changed
and
cries
of
triumph
were
once
more
heard
along
their
line
we
looked
forth
to
discover
the
cause
to
our
dismay
we
perceived
a
reinforcement
just
joining
them
five
fresh
horsemen
were
riding
up
evidently
a
portion
of
the
band
they
appeared
to
have
come
from
behind
the
mesa
from
the
direction
of
the
rancheria
though
as
we
galloped
forward
we
had
not
observed
them
the
mound
had
concealed
them
from
our
view
notwithstanding
this
accession
to
their
strength
their
courage
did
not
appear
to
gain
by
it
as
no
charge
was
attempted
almost
on
the
instant
that
their
new
allies
arrived
upon
the
ground
the
troop
filed
off
by
twos
and
deployed
across
the
mouth
of
the
little
bay
in
which
we
had
taken
shelter
the
movement
was
soon
completed
and
six
pair
of
them
were
now
ranged
before
us
at
equal
distances
from
each
other
the
remaining
three
men
ijurra
and
two
others
kept
their
places
directly
in
front
of
us
in
one
of
the
i
recognised
a
ruffian
whom
i
had
frequently
noticed
at
the
rancheria
he
was
a
man
of
large
size
and
what
is
rare
among
mexicans
but
i
believe
he
was
a
among
whom
men
are
not
uncommon
he
was
familiarly
known
by
the
sobriquet
of
the
fox
probably
on
account
of
the
hue
of
his
hair
and
i
had
heard
from
good
authority
that
of
the
that
the
fellow
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a

intervals

boldly
through
the
streets
and
freely
mingles
in
society
such
was
el
zorro
one
of
the
men
of
ijurra
the
design
of
our
enemy
was
now
manifest
they
had
no
intention
of
making
an
immediate
attack
upon
us
they
saw
that
our
retreat
was
impossible
and
had
resolved
to
hold
us
in
siege
perhaps
till
thirst
and
hunger
should
force
us
to
surrender
their
calculation
was
founded
on
probability
if
their
valour
was
weak
their
cunning
was
strong
and
subtle
rube
was
now
greatly
out
of
sorts
when
he
saw
the
guerrilleros
fixing
themselves
in
the
manner
described
he
seemed
to
regret
that
we
had
taken
our
stand

see

the
emphatic
utterance
of
the
last
words
caused
garey
and
myself
to
look
towards
the
speaker
and
then
in
the
direction
in
which
he
pointed
a
spectacle
came
before
our
eyes
that
spite
the
depression
of
our
spirits
caused
both
of
us
to
break
into
loud
laughter
the
ole
mar
that
for
many
long
years
had
carried
rube
over
the
mountains
and
prairies
was
a
creature
that
scarce
yielded
to
himself
in
peculiarity
she
was
a
lank
animal
like
all
of
her
race
for
she
belonged
to
the
race
of
rosinante
the
long
ears
caused
her
to
look
mulish
and
at
a
distance
she
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
mixed
breed
but
it
was
not
so
she
was
a
true
mustang
and
spite
of
her
degenerate
look
a
pure
andalusian
she
seemed
to
have
been
at
an
earlier
period
of
her
life
of
that
dun
yellowish
colour
known
as
a
common
hue
among
mexican
horses
but
time
and
scars
had
metamorphosed
her
and
grey
hairs
predominated
particularly
about
the
head
and
neck
these
parts
were
covered
with
a
dirty
grizzle
of
mixed
colour
she
was
badly
and
at
stated
intervals
of
several
minutes
each
her
back
from
the
spasmodic
action
of
the
lungs
heaved
up
with
a
jerk
as
though
she
was
trying
to
kick
and
could
her
body
was
as
thin
as
a
rail
and
her
head
habitually
carried
below
the
level
of
her
shoulders
but
there
was
something
in
the
twinkle
of
her
solitary
eye
for
she
had
but
one
that
told
you
she
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
for
a
long
time
to
come
as
rube
often
alleged
she
was
game
to
the
backbone
such
was
the
ole
mar
and
it
was
to
her
that
our
attention
was
now
so
suddenly
called
having
parted
from
her
on
the
prairie
in
the
wild
gallop
that
followed
we
had
thought
no
more
of
the
creature
not
caring
that
is
garey
and
myself
what
became
of
her
rube
however
was
far
from
sharing
our
indifference
as
to
her
fate
he
would
almost
as
soon
have
parted
with
one
of
his
claws
as
that
same
faithful
companion
and
we
had
heard
him
expressing
his
hopes
that
no
harm
would
come
to
her
or
course
we
had
concluded
that
she
would
either
be
shot
or
lazoed
by
one
of
the
guerrilleros
it
appeared
however
that
this
was
not
to
be
her
fate
just
then
resolving
not
to
be
parted
from
her
master
so
easily
she
had
galloped
after
us
being
slow
she
soon
fell
behind
and
for
a
while
was
mixed
up
with
the
horses
of
the
guerrilleros
of
course
the
men
had
noticed
her
but
seeing
that
she
was
a
worthless
brute
had
not
deigned
to
make
a
capture
of
her
in
due
time
she
fell
into
the
rear
of
the
whole
troop
but
even
that
did
not
turn
her
from
her
original
intention
and
at
the
moment
of
exclamation
she
was
just
breaking
through
the
line
of
deployment
on
her
way
to
join
her
master
from
the
manner
in
which
her
nose
was
held
as
she
ran
she
appeared
to
be
trailing
him
by
the
scent
seeing
her
pass
one
of
the
guerrilleros
dashed
after
to
capture
her
perhaps
because
there
was
an
old
saddle
with
some
of
rube
traps
buckled
upon
it
mare
saddle
and
all
were
scarcely
worth
the
fling
of
lazo
and
so
the
man
appeared
to
think
for
instead
of
using
his
lazo
he
rode
forward
with
the
intention
of
seizing
the
mare
by
the
bridle
the
feat
proved
not
so
easy
of
accomplishment
as
the
fellow
bent
down
to
grasp
the
rein
the
old
mare
uttered
one
of
her
wild
squeals
slewed
her
about
and
raising
her
heels
high
in
air
delivered
them
right
upon
the
ribs
of
the
mexican
the
heavy
thud
was
heard
by
all
of
us
and
the
man
swayed
from
his
saddle
and
fell
to
the
ground
to
all
appearance
badly
hurt
and
most
probably
with
a
pair
of
broken
ribs
the
squeal
of
the
mare
was
echoed
by
a
shrill
laugh
from
the
throat
of
her
delighted
master
and
not
until
she
had
galloped
up
to
him
did
he
cease
to
make
the
locks
ring
with
his
wild
cachinnations
woop
yur
thur
ole

he
shouted
as
the
animal
halted
before
him
you

kum
hyur
this
away
thur
now
and
the
speaker
proceeded
after
some
more
apostrophising
to
draw
the
animal
closer
up
to
the
cliff
placing
her
body
as
an
additional
barricade
in
front
of
his
own
our
involuntary
mirth
was
of
short
duration
it
was
interrupted
by
an
object
that
filled
our
hearts
with
new
apprehension
chapter
thirty
five
el
zorro
the
new
object
of
dread
was
a
large
gun
which
had
been
brought
upon
the
ground
by
one
of
those
lately
arrived
in
all
probability
it
belonged
to
el
zorro
as
it
was
in
his
hands
we
first
observed
it
it
appeared
to
be
a
long
musket
or
such
as
the
roers
in
use
among
south
african
hunters
whatever
sort
of
weapon
it
was
we
soon
found
to
our
annoyance
that
it
pitched
an
ounce
of
lead
nearly
twice
as
far
as
any
of
our
rifles
and
with
sufficient
precision
to
make
it
probable
that
before
the
sun
had
set
el
zorro
would
be
able
to
pick
off
our
horses
and
perhaps
ourselves
in
detail
it
would
be
before
darkness
should
screen
us
with
its
friendly
shelter
and
he
had
already
commenced
practice
his
first
shot
had
been
fired
the
bullet
struck
the
cliff
close
to
my
own
head
scattering
the
fragments
of
gypsum
rock
about
my
ears
and
then
fell
flattened
like
a
spanish
dollar
at
my
feet
the
report
was
far
louder
than
that
of
either
carbine
or
escopette
and
an
ejaculation
from
rube
as
he
saw
the
effect
of
the
shot
followed
by
his
usual
ominous
whistle
told
that
the
old
trapper
was
not
disposed
to
make
light
of
this
new
piece
of
ordnance
neither
was
garey
his
look
testified
to
what
all
three
of
us
were
thinking
which
was
that
this
mode
of
attack
was
likely
to
put
us
in
a
more
awkward
dilemma
than
we
had
yet
been
placed
in
el
zorro
might
shoot
us
down
at
his
leisure
with
our
rifles
we
could
neither
answer
his
fire
nor
silence
it
our
peril
was
obvious
the
salteador
had
delivered
his
first
shot
off
hand
for
we
had
seen
him
level
the
piece
perhaps
it
was
fortunate
for
us
he
had
not
taken
aim
over
a
lean
but
fortune
from
that
source
was
not
going
to
favour
us
any
farther
for
we
now
observed
ijurra
stick
two
lances
obliquely
in
the
ground
so
that
they
crossed
each
other
at
a
proper
height
thus
forming
as
perfect
a
rest
as
marksman
could
have
desired
as
soon
as
the
gun
was
reloaded
el
zorro
knelt
behind
the
lances
placed
his
barrel
in
the
fork
and
once
more
took
aim
i
felt
satisfied
he
was
aiming
at
or
my
horse
indeed
the
direction
of
the
long
dark
tube
would
have
told
me
so
but
i
saw
ijurra
directing
him
and
that
made
me
sure
of
it
i
had
little
fear
for
myself
i
was
sheltered
sufficiently
but
i
trembled
for
the
brave
horse
that
shielded
me
i
waited
with
anxious
heart
i
saw
the
blaze
of
the
priming
as
it
puffed
upward
the
red
flame
projected
from
the
muzzle
and
simultaneously
i
felt
the
shock
of
the
heavy
bullet
striking
upon
my
horse
splinters
of
wood
flew
about
my
face
they
were
fragments
of
the
the
ball
had
passed
through
the
pommel
but
my
noble
steed
was
untouched
it
was
a
close
shot
however
too
close
to
allow
of
rejoicing
so
long
as
others
of
the
like
were
to
follow
i
was
getting
as
riled
as
rube
himself
when
all
at
once
a
significant
shout
from
the
old
trapper
drew
my
attention
from
el
zorro
and
his
gun
rube
was
on
my
right
and
i
saw
that
he
was
pointing
along
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
to
some
object
in
that
direction
i
could
not
see
what
it
was
as
his
horses
were
in
the
way
but
the
next
moment
i
observed
him
hurrying
them
along
the
cliff
at
the
same
time
calling
to
garey
and
myself
to
follow
i
lost
no
time
in
putting
my
horse
in
motion
and
garey
as
hastily
trotted
after
we
had
not
advanced
many
paces
before
we
comprehended
the
strange
behaviour
of
our
companion
scarcely
twenty
yards
from
where
we
had
first
halted
a
large
rock
rested
upon
the
plain
it
was
a
fragment
that
had
fallen
from
the
cliff
and
was
now
lying
several
feet
from
its
base
it
was
of
such
size
and
in
such
a
position
that
there
was
ample
space
behind
it
to
shelter
both
men
and
horses
room
for
us
all
we
were
only
astonished
we
had
not
observed
it
sooner
but
this
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
its
colour
corresponded
exactly
with
that
of
the
cliff
and
it
was
difficult
even
at
twenty
yards
distance
to
distinguish
it
from
the
latter
besides
our
eyes
from
the
moment
of
our
halting
had
been
turned
in
another
direction
we
did
not
stay
to
give
words
to
our
surprise
but
hurrying
our
horses
along
with
us
with
joyful
exclamations
glided
behind
the
rock
it
was
not
an
echo
of
our
joy
but
a
cry
of
disappointed
rage
that
pealed
along
the
line
of
the
guerrilla
they
saw
at
once
that
their
long
gun
would
no
longer
avail
them
and
both
ijurra
and
his
marksman
were
now
seen
dancing
over
the
ground
like
madmen
el
zorro
was
at
an
end
a
more
perfect
harbour
of
refuge
could
not
have
been
found
in
all
as
garey
alleged
it
beat
all
hollow
a
little
fortress
in
fact
in
which
we
might
defy
even
twice
the
number
of
our
assailants
unless
indeed
they
should
wax
desperately
brave
and
try
us
hand
to
hand
our
sudden
disappearance
had
created
a
new
sensation
in
their
ranks
from
their
shouts
we
could
tell
that
some
of
them
regarded
it
with
feelings
of
wonder
perhaps
with
emotions
of
a
still
stronger
kind
we
could
hear
the
exclamations
with
the
phrase
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
indeed
from
the
position
which
they
occupied
it
must
have
appeared
to
them
that
we
had
gone
into
the
cliff
for
the
separation
of
the
rock
from
the
wall
behind
it
was
not
perceptible
from
the
plain
else
should
have
perceived
it
as
we
rode
forward
if
our
enemies
knew
of
this
outlying
boulder
it
was
strange
they
had
left
the
way
open
to
so
safe
a
retreat
strange
since
it
did
not
correspond
with
the
cunning
they
had
otherwise
given
proofs
of
and
yet
stranger
they
should
be
ignorant
of
its
existence
most
of
them
were
natives
of
this
frontier
and
must
have
frequently
visited
the
mesa
which
was
one
of
the
lions
of
the
district
perhaps
they
had
never
troubled
their
thoughts
about
it
there
is
no
people
who
take
less
interest
in
the
rare
features
of
their
beautiful
country
than
the
mexicans
nature
charms
them
not
a
mexican
dwelling
with
a
garden
around
it
is
a
rarity
a
lawn
or
a
shrubbery
is
never
seen
but
indeed
nature
has
bounteously
supplied
them
with
all
these
they
dwell
amidst
scenes
of
picturesque
beauty
they
gaze
over
green
savannas
down
into
deep
barrancas
up
to
the
summits
of
mighty
mountains
without
experiencing
one
emotion
of
the
sublime
a
tortured
bull
a
cock
roman
candles
and
the
chinese
wheel
are
to
them
the
sights
of
superior
interest
and
furnish
them
with
all
their
petty
emotions
so
is
it
with
nations
as
with
men
who
have
passed
the
age
of
their
strength
and
reached
the
period
of
senility
and
second
childhood
but
there
was
another
and
perhaps
a
better
reason
why
none
of
our
adversaries
should
be
intimate
with
the
locality
as
my
companions
alleged
the
spot
was
a
favourite
of
the
comanches
have
an
eye
for
the
picturesque
but
perhaps
the
existence
of
a
spring
that
was
near
had
more
to
do
in
guiding
the
preference
of
these
lords
of
the
prairies
the
mesa
therefore
had
for
years
been
dangerous
ground
and
little
trodden
by
the
idle
curious
possibly
not
one
of
the
heroes
we
saw
before
us
had
for
years
ventured
so
far
out

plains
chapter
thirty
six
a
plan
of
escape
if
our
enemies
were
awed
by
our
sudden
disappearance
it
was
soon
robbed
of
its
mysterious
character
our
faces
and
the
dark
barrels
of
our
rifles
visible
around
the
edges
of
the
white
rock
must
have
dispelled
all
ideas
of
the
supernatural
having
hastily
disposed
of
our
horses
we
had
placed
ourselves
thus
in
case
of
a
charge
being
made
though
of
this
we
had
no
longer
any
great
apprehension
and
still
less
as
we
watched
the
movements
of
our
adversaries
el
zorro
continued
for
some
time
to
fire
his
big
gun
the
bullets
of
which
we
could
dodge
as
easily
as
if
they
had
been
turnips
hurled
at
us
and
the
leaden
missiles
fell
harmlessly
at
our
feet
seeing
this
the
salteador
at
length
ceased
firing
and
with
another
rode
off
in
the
direction
of
the
settlements
no
doubt
sent
on
some
errand
by
ijurra
one
pair
of
eyes
was
sufficient
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
besiegers
garey
undertook
this
duty
leaving
rube
and
myself
free
to
think
over
some
plan
of
escape
that
we
were
not
to
be
attacked
was
now
certain
we
had
the
choice
then
of
two
alternatives
either
to
keep
the
position
we
were
in
till
thirst
should
force
us
to
surrender
or
attack
and
by
a
bold
cut
our
way
through
their
line
as
to
the
former
we
well
knew
that
thirst
would
soon
compel
us
to
yield
hunger
we
dreaded
not
we
had
our
knives
and
before
us
a
plentiful
stock
of
that
food
on
which
the
prairie
wanderer
often
sustains
life
we
had
all
eaten
and
could
do
so
again
but
for
the
thirst
we
had
made
no
provision
our
were
empty
had
been
empty
for
hours
we
were
actually
pushing
for
the
when
the
enemy
first
came
in
sight
we
were
then
athirst
but
the
excitement
of
the
skirmish
with
the
play
of
passion
incident
thereto
had
augmented
the
appetite
and
already
were
we
a
prey
to
its
keenest
pangs
we
mumbled
as
we
talked
for
each
of
us
was
chewing
the
leaden
bullet
thirst
we
dreaded
even
more
than
our
armed
enemy
the
other
alternative
was
a
desperate
one
now
more
desperate
than
ever
from
the
increased
number
of
our
foes
to
cut
our
way
through
them
had
no
other
signification
than
to
fight
the
whole
party
hand
to
hand
and
we
regretted
that
we
had
not
done
so
when
only
eleven
were
opposed
to
us
a
little
reflection
however
convinced
us
that
we
were
in
a
yet
better
position
we
might
make
the
attempt
in
the
darkness
night
would
favour
us
to
some
extent
could
we
succeed
by
a
bold
dash
in
breaking
through
their
deployed
line
we
might
escape
under
the
friendly
cover
of
the
night
and
the
confusion
consequent
upon
the
melee
there
was
probability
in
this
the
boldest
was
clearly
the
wisest
course
we
could
pursue
desperate
it
appeared
one
or
other
of
us
might
fall
but
it
offered
the
only
hope
that
of
us
might
get
free
for
we
knew
that
to
surrender
was
to
be
shot
perhaps
worse
we
had
but
faint
hopes
of
a
rescue
so
faint
we
scarcely
entertained
them
i
knew
that
my
friends
the
rangers
would
be
in
search
of
me
wheatley
and
holingsworth
would
not
give
me
up
without
making
an
effort
for
my
recovery
but
then
the
search
would
be
made
in
a
different
direction
that
in
which
i
had
gone
and
which
lay
many
miles
from
the
route
by
the
mesa
even
had
they
thought
of
sending
to
the
mound
the
search
must
have
been
already
made
and
the
party
returned
from
it
too
long
time
had
elapsed
to
make
any
calculation
on
a
chance
like
this
the
hope
was
not
worth
holding
and
we
held
it
not
for
some
time
rube
and
i
thought
in
combination
canvassing
the
details
of
the
plan
that
had
offered
after
a
while
we
stood
apart
and
each
pursued
the
train
of
his
own
reflections
i
declare
that
in
that
hour
i
had
more
painful
thoughts
than
those
that
arose
from
the
peril
of
my
situation
this
i
solemnly
declare
i
have
already
said
that
when
i
first
recognised
the
leader
of
the
guerrilla
i
experienced
an
unpleasant
suspicion
since
then
i
had
not
time
to
dwell
upon
it
engrossing
all
my
thoughts
now
that
i
found
more
leisure
for
reflection
the
dire
doubt
returned
in
full
strength
and
i
bitterly
pondered
upon
it
need
i
name
the
subject
of
my
wretched
reflections
isolina
de
vargas
knew
of
this
knew
she
that
ijurra
was
the
chief
of
a
guerrilla
her
cousin
sharer
of
the
same
roof
she
could
scarcely
be
ignorant
of
it
who
set
him
on
our
trail
oh
bitter
thought
was
the
hunt
of
the
wild
horse
a
a
scheme
to
separate
me
from
my
command
and
thus
render
it
an
easy
prey
to
the
mexican
guerrilleros
perhaps
my
straggling
followers
were
by
this
cut
off
perhaps
the
post
had
been
attacked
by
a
large
body
of
the
enemy
captured
i
was
not
only
to
lose
life
but
had
already
lost
my
honour
i
the
proud
captain
of
a
boasted
troop
to
be
thus
entrapped
by
artifice
the
artifice
of
a
woman
my
heart
overwhelmed
with
such
bitter
fancies
stayed
not
to
reason
presently
followed
a
calmer
interval
and
i
began
to
discuss
the
probability
of
my
suspicions
what
motive
could
she
have
to
plot
my
destruction
surely
not
from
any
feeling
of
love
for
her
country
and
hatred
towards
its
enemies
from
all
i
had
learned
no
such
sentiment
existed
in
her
mind
but
rather
an
opposite
one
a
truer
patriotism
she
was
a
woman
of
sufficient
aim
and
intellect
to
have
a
feeling
one
way
or
the
other
but
had
i
not
good
grounds
for
believing
her
a
friend
to
our
cause
a
foe
to
the
tyrants
we
would
conquer
if
otherwise
i
was
the
victim
of
profound
deception
and
unparalleled
hypocrisy
perhaps
however
her
feeling
was
personal
not
national
was
alone
the
object
of
her
hatred
had
i
done
aught
by
word
or
deed
to
call
forth
her
antagonism
to
deserve
such
cruel
vengeance
if
so
i
was
sadly
ignorant
of
the
fact
if
she
hated
me
she
hated
one
who
loved
with
his
whole
soul
absorbed
in
the
passion
but
no
i
could
not
think
that
i
was
an
object
of
hatred
to
her
why
should
she
hate
me
how
she
i
could
think
of
but
one
motive
why
she
should
make
herself
instrumental
in
the
accomplishment
of
my
ruin
it
was
explicable
only
on
the
presumption
that
she
was
attached
to
ijurra
that
rafael
ijurra
was
the
lord
of
her
heart
if
so
he
could
easily
bend
it
to
his
will
for
this
is
but
the
sequence
of
the
other
could
influence
her
to
whatever
act
as
for
ijurra
there
was
motive
enough
for
his
hostility
even
to
the
seeking
of
my
life
the
insult
put
upon
him
at
our
first
meeting
the
knowledge
that
i
loved
for
i
was
certain
he
knew
it
with
the
additional
fact
that
i
was
an
enemy
one
of
the
invaders
of
his
country
these
were
sufficient
motives
though
doubtless
the
two
first
far
outweighed
the
other
with
rafael
ijurra
revenge
and
jealousy
were
stronger
passions
than
patriotism
then
came
consolation
thoughts
of
brighter
hue
in
the
face
of
all
was
the
fact
that
white
steed
had
been
and
captured
there
stood
the
beautiful
creature
before
my
eyes
there
was
no
deception
in
that
there
could
be
none
no
scheme
could
have
contrived
a
contingency
so
remarkable
ijurra
might
easily
have
known
of
the
expedition
without
agency
its
result
he
would
have
learned
from
the
returned
vaqueros
he
had
time
enough
then
to
collect
his
band
and
set
after
me
perhaps
she
even
knew
not
that
he
was
a
leader
of
guerrilleros
i
had
heard
that
his
movements
were
shrouded
in
mystery
that
mystery
which
covers
the
designs
of
the

had
served
in
the

chapter

elijah
quackenboss
while
these
reflections
were
passing
through
my
mind
i
was
standing
or
rather
leaning
with
my
back
against
the
boulder
and
my
face
towards
the
wall
of
the
mesa
directly
in
front
of
me
was
a
recess
or
indentation
in
the
cliff
carried
upward
and
deepening
as
it
approached
the
summit
it
was
a
slight
gorge
or
furrow
evidently
formed
by
the
attrition
of
water
and
probably
the
conduit
of
the
rain
that
fell
upon
the
table
surface
of
the
mound
though
the
cliffs
on
each
side
were
perfectly
vertical
the
gorge
had
a
considerable
inclination
and
the
instant
my
eyes
rested
upon
it
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
precipice
at
this
point
could
be
scaled
up
to
this
moment
i
had
not
thought
of
such
a
thing
for
i
had
been
under
the
impression
from
what
my
companions
had
told
me
that
the
summit
of
the
mesa
was
inaccessible
housing
myself
to
more
energetic
observation
i
scrutinised
the
cliff
from
base
to
summit
and
the
more
i
regarded
it
the
stronger
grew
my
conviction
that
without
great
difficulty
an
active
climber
might
reach
the
top
there
were
protuberances
on
the
rock
that
would
serve
as
and
here
and
there
small
bushes
of
the
trailing
cedar
hung
out
from
the
seams
that
would
materially
assist
any
one
making
the
ascent
while
scanning
these
peculiarities
i
was
startled
by
observing
several
abrasions
on
the
face
of
the
rock
these
marks
appeared
quite
fresh
and
evidently
made
by
some
other
agency
than
that
of
the
elements
after
a
short
examination
i
became
convinced
that
they
were
marks
made
by
a
human
foot
the
scratches
of
a
shoe
beyond
a
doubt
cliff
had
been
my
first
impulse
was
to
communicate
the
discovery
to
my
companions
but
i
forbore
for
a
while
in
order
to
satisfy
myself
that
the
person
who
had
made
this
daring
attempt
had
actually
succeeded
in
reaching
the
summit
twilight
was
on
and
i
could
get
only
an
indistinct
view
of
the
gorge
at
its
upper
part
but
i
saw
enough
to
convince
me
that
the
attempt
had
been
successful
what
bold
fellow
had
ventured
this
and
with
what
object
were
the
questions
i
naturally
asked
myself
vague
recollections
were
stirring
within
me
presently
they
grew
more
distinct
and
all
at
once
i
was
able
to
answer
both
the
interrogatories
i
had
put
i
knew
the
man
who
had
climbed
that
cliff
i
only
wondered
i
had
not
thought
of
him
before
among
the
many
odd
characters
in
the
piebald
band
of
which
i
had
the
honour
to
be
chief
not
the
least
odd
was
one
who
answered
to
the
euphonious
name
of
elijah
quackenboss
he
was
a
mixture
of
yankee
and
german
originating
somewhere
in
the
mountains
of
pennsylvania
he
had
been
a
schoolmaster
among
his
native
hills
had
picked
up
some
little
but
what
rendered
him
more
interesting
to
me
was
the
fact
that
he
was
a
botanist
not
a
very
scientific
one
it
is
true
but
in
whatever
way
obtained
he
possessed
a
respectable
knowledge
of
and
and
evinced
an
aptitude
for
the
study
not
inferior
to
linneus
himself
the
more
surprising
was
this
that
such
inclinations
are
somewhat
rare
among
americans
but
quackenboss
no
doubt
drew
his
instinct
from
his
teutonic
ancestry
if
his
intellectual
disposition
was
odd
not
less
so
was
his
physical
his
person
was
tall
crooked
and
lanky
and
none
of
those
members
that
should
have
been
counterparts
of
each
other
seemed
exactly
to
match
his
arms
were
odd
ones
his
limbs
were
unlike
and
all
four
looked
as
if
they
had
met
by
accident
and
could
not
agree
upon
anything
his
eyes
were
no
better
mated
and
never
consented
to
look
in
the
same
direction
but
with
the
right
one
elijah
quackenboss
could
sight
a
rifle
and
drive
in
a
nail
at
a
hundred
yards
distance
from
his
odd
habits
his
companions
the
rangers
regarded
him
as
hardly
square
but
this
idea
was
partially
derived
from
seeing
him
engaged
in
his
botanical
researches
an
occupation
that
to
them
appeared
simply
absurd
they
knew
however
that
dutch
lige
such
was
his
sobriquet
could
shoot
plum
centre
and
notwithstanding
his
quiet
demeanour
had
proved
himself
good
stuff
at
the
bottom
and
this
shielded
him
from
the
ridicule
he
would
otherwise
have
experienced
at
their
hands
than
quackenboss
a
more
ardent
student
of
botany
i
never
saw
no
labour
retarded
him
in
the
pursuit
no
matter
how
wearied
with
drill
or
other
duties
the
moment
the
hours
became
his
own
he
would
be
off
in
search
of
rare
plants
wandering
far
from
camp
and
at
times
placing
himself
in
situations
of
extreme
danger
since
his
arrival
on
texan
ground
he
had
devoted
much
attention
to
the
study
of
the
and
now
having
reached
mexico
the
home
of
these
singular
endogens
he
might
be
said
to
have
gone
every
day
his
researches
disclosed
to
him
new
forms
of
cactus
or
cereus
and
it
was
in
connexion
with
one
of
these
that
he
was
now
recalled
to
my
memory
i
remembered
his
having
told
me
for
a
similarity
of
tastes
frequently
brought
us
into
conversation
of
his
having
discovered
but
a
few
days
before
a
new
and
singular
species
of
he
had
found
it
growing
upon
a
which
he
had
climbed
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
his
botany
adding
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
observed
the
species
only
upon
the
top
of
this
mound
and
nowhere
else
in
the
surrounding
country
this
mound
was
our
mesa
it
had
been
climbed
by
elijah
quackenboss
if
he
awkward
animal
that
he
was
had
been
able
to
scale
the
height
why
could
not
this
was
my
reflection
and
without
staying
to
consider
what
advantage
we
should
derive
from
such
a
proceeding
i
communicated
the
discovery
to
my
companions
both
appeared
delighted
and
after
a
short
scrutiny
declared
the
path
practicable
garey
believed
he
could
easily
go
up
and
rube
in
his
terse
way
said
that
his
jeints
so
stiff
yit
only
a
month
ago
he
had
clomd
a
bluff
than
it
but
now
the
reflection
occurred
to
what
purpose
should
we
make
the
ascent
we
could
not
escape
in
that
way
there
was
no
chance
of
our
being
able
to
descend
upon
the
other
side
for
there
the
cliff
was
impracticable
the
behaviour
of
the
guerrilleros
had
given
proof
of
this
some
time
before
ijurra
with
another
had
gone
to
the
rear
of
the
mound
evidently
to
reconnoitre
it
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
assail
us
from
behind
but
they
had
returned
and
their
gestures
betokened
their
disappointment
why
then
should
we
ascend
if
we
could
not
also
descend
on
the
opposite
side
true
upon
the
summit
we
should
be
perfectly
safe
from
an
attack
of
the
guerrilla
but
not
from
and
this
was
the
enemy
we
now
dreaded
water
would
not
be
found
on
the
top
of
the
mesa
it
could
not
better
our
situation
to
go
there
on
the
contrary
we
should
be
in
a
worse
fix
than
ever
so
said
garey
where
we
were
we
had
our
horses
a
spare
one
to
eat
when
that
became
necessary
and
the
others
to
aid
us
in
our
attempt
to
escape
should
we
climb
the
cliff
these
must
be
left
behind
from
the
top
was
less
than
fifty
yards
and
our
rifles
would
still
cover
them
from
the
clutch
of
our
enemies
but
to
what
advantage
like
ourselves
they
must
in
time
fall
before
thirst
and
hunger
the
gleam
of
hope
died
within
us
as
suddenly
as
it
had
sprung
up
it
could
in
no
wise
serve
us
to
scale
the
cliff
we
were
better
in
our
present
position
we
could
hold
that
so
long
as
thirst
would
allow
us
we
could
not
do
more
within
the
granite
walls
of
an
impregnable
fortress
this
was
the
conclusion
at
which
garey
and
i
had
simultaneously
arrived
rube
had
not
yet
expressed
himself
the
old
man
was
standing
with
both
hands
clutching
his
long
rifle
the
butt
of
which
rested
upon
the
ground
he
held
the
piece
near
the
muzzle
partially
leaning
upon
it
while
he
appeared
gazing
intently
into
the
barrel
this
was
one
of
his
ways
when
endeavouring
to
unravel
a
knotty
question
and
garey
and
i
knowing
this
peculiarity
on
the
part
of
the
old
trapper
remained
silent
leaving
him
to
the
free
development
of
his
instincts
chapter
thirty
eight
rube
plan
for
several
minutes
rube
preserved
his
meditative
attitude
without
uttering
a
word
or
making
the
slightest
motion
at
length
a
low
but
cheerful
whistle
escaped
his
lips
and
at
the
same
time
his
body
became
erect
eh
what
old
boy
inquired
garey
who
understood
the
signal
and
knew
that
the
whistle
denoted
some
discovery

the

to

for

as
coolly

cheerfully
as
if
no

was
within
a
thousand
miles
of
the
spot
garey
and
i
were
chafing
with
impatience
but
we
knew
that
our
comrade
was
in
one
of
his
queer
moods
and
it
was
no
use
attempting
to
push
him
faster
than
he
was
disposed
to
go
when
his
chuckling
fit
was
ended
he
assumed
a
more
serious
air
and
once
more
appeared
to
busy
himself

before
he
had
ceased
talking
both
garey
and

had
divined
his
plan
but
we
refrained
from
telling
him
so
to
have
anticipated
the
old
trapper
in
his
disclosure
would
have
been
a
mortal
offence

meant
what
think
you
of
the
plan
mentally
both
garey
and
i
had
already
approved
of
it
and
we
promptly
signified
our
approval
it
really
promised
well
should
we
succeed
in
carrying
out
the
details
without
being
detected
it
was
probable
enough
that
within
a
few
hours
we
might
be
safe
in
the
piazza
of
the
rancheria
and
quenching
our
thirst
at
its
crystal
well
the
anticipated
pleasure
filled
us
with
fresh
energy
and
we
instantly
set
about
putting
everything
in
readiness
one
watched
while
the
other
two
worked
our
lazoes
were
knotted
together
and
the
four
horses
fastened
head
to
head
with
their
bridles
and
secured
so
as
to
keep
them
behind
the
boulder
this
done
we
awaited
the
falling
of
night
would
it
be
a
dark
night
about
this
we
now
felt
anxious
it
was
already
closing
down
and
gave
promise
of
favouring
us
a
layer
of
clouds
covered
the
sky
and
we
knew
there
could
be
no
moon
before
midnight
rube
who
boasted
he
could
read
like
a
sailor
scrutinised
the
sky
wal
old
hos
interrogated
garey
what
do
ye
think
will
it
be
dark
eh
black
as
a
bar
muttered
rube
in
reply
and
then
as
if
not
satisfied
with
the
simile
he
added
black
as
the
inside
o
a
buffler
belly
on
a
burnt
paraira
the
old
trapper
laughed
heartily
at
the
ludicrous
conceit
and
garey
and
i
could
not
refrain
from
joining
in
the
laugh
the
guerrilleros
must
have
heard
us
they
must
have
deemed
us
mad
rube
prognostication
proved
correct
the
night
came
down
dark
and
lowering
the
leaden
layer
broke
up
into
black
cumulus
clouds
that
slowly
careered
across
the
canopy
of
the
sky
a
storm
portended
and
already
some
big
drops
that
shot
vertically
downward
could
be
heard
plashing
heavily
upon
our
saddles
all
this
was
to
our
satisfaction
but
at
that
moment
a
flash
of
lightning
illumined
the
whole
arch
of
the
heavens
lighting
the
prairie
as
with
a
thousand
torches
it
was
none
of
the
pale
light
seen
in
northern
climes
but
a
brilliant
blaze
that
appeared
to
pervade
all
space
and
almost
rivalled
the
brightness
of
day
its
sudden
and
unexpected
appearance
filled
us
with
dismay
we
recognised
in
it
an
obstacle
to
our
designs
durn
the
tarnal
thing
exclaimed
rube
peevishly
it
ur
wuss
than
a
moon
durn
it
is
it
going
to
be
the
or
the
inquired
garey
with
a
reference
to
two
distinct
modes
in
which
upon
these
southern
prairies
the
electric
fluid
exhibits
itself
in
the
former
the
flashes
are
quick
and
and
the
intervals
of
darkness
also
of
short
duration
bolts
pierce
the
clouds
in
straight
shafts
or
forking
and
followed
by
thunder
in
loud
unequal
bursts
and
dashes
of
intermittent
rain
the
other
is
very
distinct
from
this
there
are
no
shafts
or
bolts
but
a
steady
blaze
which
fills
the
whole
firmament
with
a
white
quivering
light
lasting
many
seconds
of
time
and
followed
by
long
intervals
of
amorphous
darkness
such
lightning
is
rarely
accompanied
by
thunder
and
rain
is
not
always
its
concomitant
though
it
was
this
sort
we
now
witnessed
and
were
falling
echoed
rube
in
reply
to
his
comrade
interrogatory
no
dod
rot
it
not
so
bad
as
thet
it
ur
the
blazey
thur
no
thunder
do
see
wal
we
must
grope
our
way
up
atween
the
glimps
i
understood
why
rube
preferred
the
blazey
the
long
intervals
of
darkness
between
the
flashes
might
enable
us
to
carry
out
our
plan
he
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
the
lightning
gleamed
a
second
time
and
the
prairie
was
lit
up
like
a
theatre
during
the
grand
scene
in
a
spectacle
we
could
see
the
guerrilleros
standing
by
their
horses
in
cordon
across
the
plain
we
could
distinguish
their
arms
and
equipments
even
the
buttons
upon
their
jackets
with
their
faces
rendered
ghastly
under
the
glare
and
their
bodies
magnified
to
gigantic
proportions
they
presented
to
our
eyes
a
wild
and
spectral
appearance
with
the
flash
there
was
no
thunder
neither
the
close
quick
clap
nor
the
distant
rumble
there
was
perfect
silence
which
rendered
the
scene
more
awfully
impressive
all
right
muttered
rube
as
he
saw
that
the
besiegers
still
kept
their
places
we
must
jest
grope
our
way
up
atween
the
glimps
but
fust
let
see
we
still
hyur
we
protruded
our
faces
and
rifles
around
the
rock
and
in
this
position
awaited
another
flash
it
came
bright
as
before
the
enemy
could
not
fail
to
have
noticed
us
our
programme
was
already
prepared
garey
was
to
ascend
first
and
take
up
the
rope
he
only
waited
for
the
termination
of
another
blaze
one
end
of
the
lazo
was
fastened
round
his
waist
and
the
rope
hung
down
behind
him
when
the
light
gleamed
again
he
was
ready
and
the
moment
it
went
out
he
glided
forward
to
the
cliff
and
commenced
his
ascent
oh
for
a
long
interval
of
darkness
chapter
thirty
nine
scaling
the
cliff
oh
for
a
long
interval
of
darkness
our
hearts
beat
anxiously
at
least
i
can
answer
for
my
own
rube
watched
the
guerrilleros
permitting
his
head
to
be
seen
by
them
my
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
rocky
wall
but
through
the
thick
darkness
i
looked
in
vain
for
our
comrade
i
listened
to
hear
how
he
was
progressing
i
could
distinguish
a
slight
scratching
against
the
cliff
each
moment
higher
and
farther
away
but
garey
climbed
with
a
moccasined
foot
and
the
noise
was
too
faint
to
reach
the
ears
of
our
enemies
oh
for
a
long
interval
of
darkness
it
appeared
a
long
one
perhaps
it
was
not
five
minutes
but
it
twice
that
before
the
lightning
again
blazed
forth
with
the
flash
i
ran
my
eyes
up
the
precipitous
wall
oh
god
garey
was
still
upon
its
face
as
yet
scarce
midway
up
he
was
standing
on
a
ledge
his
body
flattened
against
the
rock
and
with
his
arms
extended
horizontally
he
presented
the
appearance
of
a
man
crucified
upon
the
cliff
so
long
as
the
glare
lasted
he
remained
in
this
attitude
motionless
as
the
rock
itself
i
turned
with
anxious
look
towards
the
guerrilleros
i
heard
no
voice
i
observed
no
movement
thank
heaven
they
saw
him
not
near
where
he
was
resting
some
bushes
of
the
trailing
cedar
grew
out
of
the
cliff
their
dark
foliage
mottled
its
white
face
rendering
the
form
of
the
climber
less
conspicuous
another
long
spell
of
darkness
another
blaze
of
light
i
scanned
the
gorge
no
human
form
was
visible
i
saw
a
dark
line
that
like
a
crack
vertically
intersected
the
cliff
from
parapet
to
base
it
was
the
rope
garey
had
carried
up
he
had
reached
the
summit
in
safety
it
was
my
turn
next
for
rube
insisted
on
retaining
the
post
of
danger
and
with
my
rifle
slung
on
my
back
i
stood
ready
i
had
given
the
parting
whisper
to
my
brave
steed
and
pressed
his
velvet
muzzle
to
my
cheek
with
the
last
flicker
of
the
electric
gleam
i
seized
the
hanging
lazo
and
drew
myself
upward
i
had
confidence
in
the
rope
i
knew
it
was
fastened
above
or
safe
in
the
strong
grasp
of
garey
with
its
aid
the
ascent
was
rendered
easy
i
experienced
no
difficulty
in
climbing
from
ledge
to
ledge
and
before
the
light
came
again
i
had
reached
the
crest
of
the
cliff
we
lay
flat
among
the
bushes
that
grew
by
the
very
brink
scarcely
showing
our
faces
to
the
front
i
saw
that
the
rope
had
been
fastened
round
the
trunk
of
a
small
tree
presently
we
perceived
by
its
jerking
that
rube
had
begun
his
ascent
shortly
after
we
could
hear
him
sprawling
and
scratching
upward
and
then
his
thin
dark
form
loomed
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
dead
beat
for
breath
he
staggered
silently
into
the
bushes
beside
us
even
in
the
darkness
i
noticed
something
peculiar
in
his
appearance
his
head
looked
smaller
but
i
had
no
time
to
question
him
we
waited
only
for
another
glance
at
the
guerrilleros
they
were
still
at
their
posts
evidently
unconscious
of
our
movements
rube
cap
cunningly
adjusted
upon
the
boulder
satisfied
them
that
we
were
still
at
ours
and
explained
moreover
the
oddness
i
had
observed
about
the
upper
story
of
the
trapper
rube
had
now
recovered
wind
and
gathering
up
the
rope
we
stole
away
over
the
to
search
for
a
place
of
descent
on
reaching
the
opposite
side
we
at
once
found
what
we
wanted
a
tree
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
many
small
pines
grew
upon
the
escarpment
and
selecting
one
we
knotted
the
rope
securely
around
its
trunk
there
was
yet
much
to
be
done
before
any
of
us
could
attempt
the
descent
we
knew
that
the
cliff
was
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
vertical
height
and
to
glide
down
a
rope
of
that
length
is
a
trying
feat
worthy
the
most
expert
of
tars
none
of
us
might
be
able
to
accomplish
it
the
first
could
be
lowered
down
easily
enough
and
this
was
our
intention
so
might
the
second
but
the
last
would
have
to
glide
down
the
rope
without
aid
we
were
not
long
delayed
by
the
contemplation
of
this
obstacle
my
comrades
were
men
of
quick
thought
and
a
plan
to
get
over
the
difficulty
soon
suggested
itself
their
knives
were
out
in
a
trice
a
sapling
was
procured
and
cut
into
short
pieces
these
were
notched
and
tied
at
intervals
along
the
rope
our
jacob
ladder
was
ready
it
still
remained
to
make
sure
that
the
rope
was
of
sufficient
length
the
knots
had
somewhat
shortened
it
but
this
point
was
soon
settled
with
like
ingenuity
a
small
stone
was
tied
to
one
end
and
then
dropped
over
the
cliff
we
listened
we
heard
the
dull
thump
of
the
stone
upon
the
prairie
turf
the
rope
therefore
reached
to
the
ground
it
was
again
drawn
up
the
stone
taken
out
and
the
noose
fastened
around
the
body
of
rube
under
his
armpits
he
was
the
lightest
and
for
this
reason
had
been
chosen
to
make
the
first
descent
as
he
would
least
try
the
strength
of
the
rope
still
a
doubtful
point
the
ascent
had
not
proved
it
for
in
climbing
up
but
of
our
weight
had
been
upon
it
our
feet
resting
either
against
the
cliff
or
upon
its
ledges
on
reaching
the
plain
rube
was
to
submit
the
rope
to
trial
before
either
garey
or
i
should
attempt
to
go
down
this
he
was
to
do
by
adding
a
large
stone
to
his
own
weight
making
both
at
least
equal
to
that
of
garey
who
was
by
far
the
heaviest
of
the
party
all
being
arranged
the
old
trapper
slid
silently
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
garey
and
i
giving
out
the
rope
slowly
and
with
caution
foot
by
foot
and
yard
by
yard
it
was
drawn
through
our
hands
by
the
weight
of
the
descending
body
now
lost
to
our
sight
over
the
brow
of
the
cliff
still
slowly
and
with
caution
we
allowed
the
lazo
to
pass
taking
care
that
it
should
glide
gradually
so
as
not
to
jerk
and
cause
the
body
of
our
comrade
to
oscillate
with
too
much
violence
against
the
rocks
we
were
both
seated
close
together
our
faces
turned
to
the
plain
more
than
of
the
rope
had
passed
from
us
and
we
were
congratulating
ourselves
that
the
trial
would
soon
be
over
when
to
our
dismay
the
strain
ceased
with
a
suddenness
that
caused
both
of
us
to
recoil
upon
our
backs
at
the
same
instant
we
heard
the
twang
of
the
snapping
rope
followed
by
a
sharp
cry
from
below
we
sprang
to
our
feet
and
mechanically
recommenced
hauling
upon
the
rope
the
weight
was
no
longer
upon
it
it
was
light
as
packthread
and
returned
to
our
hands
without
effort
desisting
we
fronted
to
each
other
but
not
for
an
explanation
neither
required
it
neither
uttered
a
word
the
case
was
clear
the
rope
had
broken
our
comrade
had
been
hurled
to
the
earth
with
a
simultaneous
impulse
we
dropped
upon
our
knees
and
crawling
forward
to
the
brink
of
the
precipice
looked
over
and
downward
we
could
see
nothing
in
the
dark
abysm
that
frowned
below
and
we
waited
till
the
light
should
break
forth
again
we
listened
with
ears
keenly
set
was
it
a
groan
we
heard
a
cry
of
agony
no
its
repetition
told
us
what
it
was
the
howl
of
the
no
human
voice
reached
our
ears
alas
no
even
a
cry
of
pain
would
have
been
welcome
since
it
would
have
told
us
our
comrade
still
lived
but
no
he
was
silent
dead
perhaps
broken
to
atoms
it
was
long
ere
the
lightning
gleamed
again
before
it
did
we
heard
voices
they
came
from
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
directly
under
us
but
there
were
two
and
neither
was
the
voice
of
the
trapper
it
is
easy
to
distinguish
the
full
intonation
of
the
saxon
from
the
shrill
treble
of
the
sons
of
anahuac
the
voices
were
those
of
our
foes
presently
the
light
discovered
them
to
us
two
there
were
they
were
on
horseback
moving
on
the
plain
below
and
close
into
the
cliff
we
saw
them
distinctly
but
we
saw
not
what
we
had
expected
the
mangled
body
of
our
comrade
the
gleam
long
continued
had
given
us
full
time
to
scrutinise
the
ground
we
could
have
distinguished
upon
it
any
object
as
large
as
a
cat
rube
living
or
dead
was
certainly
not
there
had
he
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
guerrilla
the
two
we
saw
carried
lances
but
no
prisoner
it
was
not
likely
they
had
captured
him
besides
we
knew
that
rube
unless
badly
crippled
would
never
have
surrendered
without
a
struggle
and
neither
shot
not
shout
had
been
heard
we
were
soon
relieved
from
all
uneasiness
on
this
score
the
brigands
continued
their
conversation
and
the
light
breeze
wafted
their
voices
upwards
so
that
we
could
distinguish
part
of
what
was
said
carrambo
exclaimed
one
impatiently
you
must
have
been
mistaken
it
was
the
coyote
you
heard
capitan
i
am
confident
it
was
a
man
voice
then
it
must
have
proceeded
from
one
of
the
behind
the
rock
there
is
no
one
out
here
but
come
let
us
return
by
the
other
side
of
the
mesa
the
admonished
us
that
they
were
passing
onward
to
carry
out
the
design
of
the
last
speaker
who
was
no
other
than
ijurra
himself
it
was
a
relief
to
know
that
our
comrade
had
not
yet
fallen
into
their
clutches
how
far
he
was
injured
we
could
not
have
an
idea
the
rope
had
given
way
close
to
the
top
and
rube
had
carried
most
of
it
down
with
him
in
the
confusion
we
had
not
noticed
how
much
remained
our
hands
when
he
fell
and
now
we
could
only
guess
seeing
that
he
had
disappeared
from
the
spot
we
were
in
high
hope
that
he
had
sustained
no
serious
injury
but
whither
had
he
gone
had
he
but
away
and
was
yet
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mesa
if
so
they
might
still
light
upon
him
there
was
none
either
by
the
base
of
the
cliff
or
on
the
surrounding
plain
garey
and
i
were
anxious
about
the
result
the
more
so
that
the
guerrilleros
had
heard
his
cry
and
were
in
search
of
him
he
might
easily
be
found
in
such
a
naked
spot
we
hastily
formed
the
determination
to
cross
the
table
summit
to
the
other
side
and
watch
the
movements
of
the
two
horsemen
guided
by
their
voices
we
once
more
knelt
above
them
at
the
rearmost
angle
of
the
mound
they
had
there
halted
to
examine
the
ground
and
only
waited
for
the
flash
we
too
waited
above
them
and
we
kin
fetch
them
out
o
thar
saddles
whispered
my
companion
i
hesitated
to
give
my
assent
perhaps
it
was
prudence
that
restrained
me
for
i
had
now
conceived
hopes
of
a
surer
deliverance
at
that
moment
gleamed
the
lightning
the
dark
horsemen
loomed
large
under
its
yellow
glare
they
were
less
than
fifty
paces
from
the
muzzles
of
our
guns
we
could
have
sighted
them
with
sure
aim
and
bayed
as
we
had
been
i
was
almost
tempted
to
yield
to
the
solicitations
of
my
companion
just
then
an
object
came
under
our
eyes
that
caused
both
of
us
to
draw
back
our
rifles
that
object
was
the
body
of
our
comrade
rube
it
was
lying
flat
along
the
ground
the
arms
and
legs
stretched
out
to
their
full
extent
and
the
face
buried
deep
in
the
grass
from
the
elevation
at
which
we
viewed
it
it
appeared
like
the
hide
of
a
young
buffalo
spread
out
to
dry
and
pinned
tightly
to
the
turf
but
we
knew
it
was
not
that
we
knew
it
was
the
body
of
a
man
dressed
in
brown
buckskin
the
body
of
the
earless
trapper
it
was
not
dead
neither
no
dead
body
could
have
placed
itself
in
such
an
attitude
for
it
lay
flattened
along
the
turf
like
a
gigantic
newt
the
object
of
this
attitude
was
evident
to
us
and
our
hearts
beat
with
a
painful
anxiety
while
the
light
flickered
around
the
body
was
scarcely
five
hundred
yards
out
but
though
perfectly
visible
from
our
position
it
must
have
been
inconspicuous
to
the
horsemen
below
for
as
soon
as
it
darkened
we
heard
them
to
our
great
relief
ride
back
toward
the
front
ijurra
reiterating
his
doubts
as
they
passed
away
fortunate
it
was
for
both
him
and
his
companion
they
had
not
espied
that
prostrate
form
fortunate
for
rube
for
all
of
us
garey
and
i
kept
our
places
and
waited
for
another
flash
when
it
came
the
brown
buckskin
was
no
longer
in
sight
far
off
nearly
a
mile
off
we
fancied
we
could
distinguish
the
same
form
flattened
out
as
before
but
the
gloam
of
the
rendered
our
vision
uncertain
of
one
thing
however
we
were
certain
our
comrade
had
escaped
chapter
forty
a
reinforcement
for
the
first
time
since
encountering
the
guerrilla
i
breathed
freely
and
felt
confident
we
should
get
free
my
comrade
shared
my
belief
and
it
is
needless
to
say
that
we
recrossed
the
summit
of
the
mesa
with
lighter
hearts
and
step
more
buoyant
of
course
we
no
longer
speculated
about
making
the
descent
with
the
fragment
of
rope
left
that
was
impossible
we
were
simply
returning
to
the
front
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
guerrilleros
and
if
possible
prevent
them
from
approaching
our
horses
should
they
by
any
chance
discover
that
we
had
retreated
from
our
position
behind
the
rock
we
were
the
more
anxious
about
our
horses
now
that
we
had
less
apprehension
for
ourselves
at
least
i
can
answer
for
myself
and
the
explanation
is
easy
so
long
as
i
felt
the
probability
that
every
moment
might
be
the
last
of
my
life
the
fate
of
moro
and
the
white
steed
was
but
a
secondary
consideration
now
that
i
felt
certain
i
should
survive
this
perilous
escapade
the
future
once
more
urged
its
claims
and
i
was
anxious
not
only
to
preserve
my
own
steed
but
the
beautiful
creature
that
had
led
me
into
all
this
peril
but
whose
capture
still
promised
its
rich
reward
that
all
danger
was
past
that
in
a
few
hours
we
should
be
free
was
the
full
belief
both
of
my
companion
and
myself
perhaps
you
may
not
comprehend
from
what
we
drew
so
confident
and
comfortable
a
conclusion
though
our
reasoning
was
simple
enough
we
knew
that
rube
would
reach
the
rancheria
and
return
with
a
rescue
that
was
all
is
true
we
were
not
without
some
anxiety
the
rangers
might
no
longer
be
there
the
army
might
have
marched
perhaps
the
picket
was
withdrawn
rube
himself
might
be
intercepted
or
slain
the
last
hypothesis
gave
us
least
concern
we
had
full
trust
in
the
trapper
ability
to
penetrate
to
the
american
camp
to
the
enemy
if
necessary
we
had
just
been
favoured
with
a
specimen
of
his
skill
whether
the
army
had
advanced
or
not
rube
would
reach
it
before
morning
if
he
should
have
to
steal
a
horse
upon
the
way
he
would
soon
find
the
rangers
and
even
without
orders
holingsworth
would
him
a
few
of
them
would
be
enough
in
the
worst
view
of
the
case
there
were
stragglers
enough
about
the
camp
odd
birds
that
could
easily
be
enlisted
for
such
a
duty
we
had
scarcely
a
doubt
that
our
comrade
would
come
back
with
a
rescue
as
to
the
time
we
were
left
to
conjectures
it
might
be
before
morning
light
it
might
not
be
before
late
in
the
following
day
or
even
the
night
after
but
that
was
a
consideration
that
now
weighed
lightly
we
could
hold
our
aerial
fortress
for
a
week
a
month
ay
far
longer
and
against
hundreds
we
could
not
be
assailed
with
our
rifles
to
guard
the
cliff
no
could
approach
no
forlorn
hope
could
scale
our
battlements
but
what
of
thirst
and
hunger
you
will
ask
ha
we
dreaded
not
either
fortune
favours
had
fallen
upon
us
in
showers
even
on
that
lone
summit
we
found
the
means
to
assuage
the
one
and
satisfy
the
other
in
crossing
the
we
stumbled
upon
huge
that
grew
over
the
ground
like
or
gigantic
they
were
the
of
quackenboss
and
some
of
them
ten
feet
in
diameter
garey
knife
was
out
in
a
trice
a
portion
of
the
spinous
coat
of
the
largest
was
stripped
off
its
top
truncated
and
a
bowl
scooped
in
the
soft
succulent
mass
in
another
minute
we
had
assuaged
our
thirst
from
this
vegetable
fountain
of
the
desert
with
similar
facility
were
we
enabled
to
gratify
the
kindred
appetite
as
i
had
conjectured
on
viewing
them
from
the
plain
the
trees
of
foliage
were
pinons
the
of
which
there
are
several
species
in
northern
mexico
whose
cones
contain
seeds
edible
and
nutritious
a
few
handfuls
of
these
we
gathered
and
hungered
no
more
they
would
have
been
better
roasted
but
at
that
moment
we
were
contented
to
eat
them
raw
no
wonder
then
that
with
such
a
supply
for
the
present
and
such
hopes
for
the
future
we
no
longer
dreaded
the
impotent
fury
of
our
foes
we
lay
down
at
the
top
of
the
gorge
to
watch
their
further
movements
and
cover
our
horses
from
their
attack
the
flash
of
the
lightning
showed
them
still
on
guard
just
as
we
had
left
them
one
of
each
file
was
mounted
while
his
companion
on
foot
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
intervals
of
the
cordon
their
measures
were
cunningly
taken
they
were
evidently
determined
we
should
not
steal
past
them
in
the
darkness
the
lightning
began
to
abate
and
the
intervals
between
the
flashes
became
longer
and
longer
during
one
of
these
intervals
we
were
startled
by
the
sound
of
at
some
distance
off
it
was
the
tramp
of
horses
upon
the
hard
plain
there
is
a
difference
between
the
of
a
ridden
horse
and
one
that
is
riderless
and
the
is
rarely
puzzled
to
distinguish
them
my
companion
at
once
pronounced
the
horses
to
be
mounted
the
guerrilleros
on
the
alert
had
heard
them
at
the
same
time
as
we
and
two
of
them
had
galloped
out
to
reconnoitre
this
we
ascertained
only
by
for
we
could
not
distinguish
an
object
six
feet
from
our
faces
the
darkness
being
almost
palpable
to
the
touch
the
sounds
came
from
a
considerable
distance
but
as
they
were
continually
growing
more
distinct
we
could
tell
that
the
horsemen
were
advancing
the
mesa
we
drew
no
hope
from
this
advent
rube
could
not
yet
have
even
reached
the
rancheria
the
were
el
zorro
and
his
companion
on
their
return
we
were
not
kept
long
in
doubt
the
horsemen
approached
and
shouts
and
salutations
were
exchanged
between
them
and
the
guerrilleros
while
the
horses
of
both
parties
neighed
in
response
as
if
they
knew
each
other
at
this
moment
the
lightning
shone
again
and
to
our
surprise
we
perceived
not
only
el
zorro
but
a
reinforcement
of
full
thirty
men
the
trampling
of
many
hoofs
had
half
prepared
us
for
this
discovery
it
was
not
without
feelings
of
alarm
that
we
beheld
this
accession
to
the
enemy
strength
surely
they
would
no
longer
hesitate
to
assail
our
fortress
behind
the
rock
at
least
then
our
horses
would
be
captured
besides
rube
rescue
might
be
too
weak
for
such
a
force
there
were
now
nearly
fifty
of
the
guerrilleros
our
anxiety
as
to
the
first
two
points
was
soon
at
an
end
to
our
astonishment
we
perceived
that
no
assault
was
to
be
made
as
yet
we
saw
them
increase
the
strength
of
their
cordon
of
sentries
and
make
other
dispositions
to
carry
on
the
siege
evidently
they
regarded
us
as
hunters
do
the
grizzly
bear
the
lion
or
tiger
not
to
be
attacked
in
our
lair
they
dreaded
the
havoc
which
they
well
knew
would
be
made
by
our
rifles
and
revolvers
and
they
determined
to
reduce
us
by
starvation
on
no
other
principle
could
we
account
for
the
cowardly
continence
of
their
revenge
chapter
forty
one
the
indian
spy
it
was
past
the
hour
of
midnight
the
lightning
that
for
some
time
had
appeared
only
at
long
intervals
now
ceased
altogether
its
fitful
glare
gave
place
to
a
softer
steadier
light
for
the
moon
had
arisen
and
was
climbing
up
the
eastern
sky
cumulus
clouds
still
hung
in
the
heavens
slowly
floating
across
the
canopy
but
their
masses
were
detached
and
the
azure
firmament
was
visible
through
the
spaces
between
the
beautiful
planet
venus
and
here
and
there
a
solitary
star
twinkled
in
these
blue
voids
or
gleamed
through
the
filmy
bordering
of
the
clouds
but
the
chiefs
of
the
constellations
alone
were
visible
the
moon
disc
was
clear
and
well
defined
whiter
from
contrast
with
the
dark
cumuli
and
her
beam
frosted
the
prairie
till
the
grass
looked
hoar
there
was
neither
mist
nor
mirage
the
electric
fluid
had
purged
the
atmosphere
of
its
gases
and
the
air
was
cool
limpid
and
bracing
though
the
moon
had
passed
the
full
so
brilliant
was
her
beam
that
an
object
could
have
been
distinguished
far
off
upon
the
plain
whose
silvery
level
extended
on
all
sides
to
the
horizon
the
thick
black
clouds
however
moving
silently
over
the
sky
occasioned
long
intervals
of
eclipse
during
which
the
prairie
as
before
was
shrouded
in
sombre
darkness
up
to
this
time
garey
and
i
had
remained
by
the
head
of
the
little
gorge
through
which
we
had
ascended
the
moon
was
behind
us
for
the
guerrilla
was
on
the
western
side
of
the
mesa
the
shadow
of
the
mound
was
thrown
far
out
upon
the
plain
and
just
beyond
its
edge
was
the
line
of
sentinels
thickly
posted
on
our
knees
among
the
low
shrubbery
we
were
unseen
by
them
while
we
commanded
a
perfect
view
of
the
whole
troop
as
they
smoked
chattered
shouted
and
sang
for
they
gave
such
tokens
of
their
jovial
humour
after
quietly
watching
them
for
some
time
garey
left
me
to
take
a
turn
round
the
summit
and
reconnoitre
the
opposite
or
eastern
side
in
that
direction
lay
the
rancheria
and
if
the
picket
was
still
stationed
there
we
might
soon
expect
the
rescue
my
rangers
were
not
the
men
to
tarry
called
forth
on
such
a
duty
and
under
rube
guidance
they
would
be
most
likely
to
make
their
approach
by
the
rear
of
the
mound
garey
therefore
went
in
that
direction
to
make
his
reconnaissance
he
had
not
parted
from
me
more
than
a
minute
when
a
dark
object
out
upon
the
plain
attracted
my
glance
i
fancied
it
was
the
figure
of
a
man
though
it
was
prostrate
and
flattened
against
the
ground
just
as
old
rube
had
appeared
when
making
his
escape
surely
it
was
not
he
i
had
but
an
indistinct
view
of
it
for
it
was
full
six
hundred
yards
from
the
mesa
and
directly
beyond
the
line
of
the
guerrilleros
just
then
a
cloud
crossing
the
moon
disc
shrouded
the
plain
and
the
dark
object
was
no
longer
visible
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
spot
and
waited
for
the
returning
light
when
the
cloud
passed
the
figure
was
no
longer
where
i
had
first
noticed
it
but
nearer
to
the
horsemen
i
perceived
the
same
object
and
in
the
same
attitude
as
before
it
was
now
within
less
than
two
hundred
yards
of
the
mexican
line
but
a
bunch
of
tufted
grass
appeared
to
shelter
it
from
the
eyes
of
the
guerrilleros
since
none
of
them
gave
any
sign
that
it
was
perceived
by
them
from
my
elevated
position
the
grass
did
not
conceal
it
i
had
a
clear
view
of
the
figure
and
was
certain
it
was
the
body
of
a
man
and
still
more
of
a
man
for
it
glistened
under
the
sheen
of
the
moonlight
as
only
a
naked
body
would
have
done
up
to
this
time
i
had
fancied
or
rather
it
might
be
rube
i
say
feared
for
i
had
no
wish
to
see
rube
upon
his
return
present
himself
in
that
fashion
surely
he
would
not
come
back
alone
and
why
should
he
be
thus
playing
the
spy
since
he
already
knew
the
exact
position
of
our
enemy
the
apparition
puzzled
me
and
i
was
for
a
while
in
doubt
but
the
body
reassured
me
it
could
not
be
rube
the
skin
was
of
a
dark
hue
but
so
was
that
of
the
old
trapper
though
born
white
the
sun
dirt
gunpowder
and
grease
with
the
smoke
of
many
a
had
altered
rube
complexion
to
the
true
and
in
point
of
colour
he
had
but
little
advantage
over
a
indian
but
rube
would
not
have
been
naked
he
never
doffed
his
buckskins
besides
the
oily
glitter
of
that
body
was
not
rube
his
hide
would
not
have
shone
so
under
the
moonlight
no
the
prostrate
form
was
not
his
another
cloud
cast
new
shadows
and
while
these
continued
i
saw
no
more
of
the
skulking
figure
as
the
moon
again
shone
forth
i
perceived
that
it
was
gone
from
behind
the
tuft
of
grass
i
scanned
the
ground
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
it
was
not
to
be
seen
but
on
looking
farther
out
i
could
just
distinguish
the
figure
of
a
man
bent
forward
and
rapidly
gliding
away
i
followed
it
with
my
eyes
until
it
disappeared
in
the
distance
as
though
melting
into
the
moonlight
while
gazing
over
the
distant
plain
in
the
direction
whence
the
figure
had
retreated
i
was
startled
at
beholding
not
one
but
many
forms
dimly
outlined
upon
the
prairie
edge
it
rube
thought
i
and
yonder
are
the
rangers
i
strained
my
eyes
to
the
utmost
they
were
horsemen
beyond
a
doubt
but
to
my
astonishment
instead
of
being
close
together
one
followed
another
in
single
file
until
a
long
line
was
traced
against
the
sky
like
the
links
of
a
gigantic
chain
except
in
the
narrow
defile
or
the
my
rangers
never
rode
in
that
fashion
it
could
not
be
they
at
this
crisis
a
new
thought
came
into
my
mind
more
than
once
in
my
life
had
i
witnessed
a
spectacle
similar
to
that
now
under
my
eyes
more
than
once
had
i
looked
upon
it
with
dread
that
serried
line
was
an
old
acquaintance
it
was
a
band
of
indian
warriors
on
their
midnight
march
upon
the
the
actions
of
the
spy
were
explained
he
was
an
indian
runner
the
party
to
whom
he
belonged
was
about
to
approach
the
mesa
perhaps
with
the
design
of
encamping
there
he
had
been
sent
forward
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
what
effect
his
tale
would
have
i
could
not
guess
i
could
see
that
the
horsemen
were
halted
perhaps
awaiting
the
return
of
their
messenger
they
were
too
distant
to
be
seen
by
the
mexicans
and
the
minute
after
they
were
also
invisible
to
my
eyes
upon
the
prairie
before
communicating
with
garey
i
resolved
to
wait
for
another
gleam
of
moonlight
so
that
i
might
have
a
more
distinct
story
to
tell
chapter
forty
two
the
caballada
it
was
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
cloud
moved
away
and
then
to
my
surprise
i
saw
a
clump
of
horses
not
upon
the
prairie
and
scarcely
distant
from
the
mesa
not
one
of
them
was
mounted
and
to
all
appearance
it
was
a
drove
of
that
had
galloped
up
during
the
interval
of
darkness
and
were
now
standing
silent
and
motionless
i
strained
my
eyes
upon
the
distant
prairie
but
the
dim
horsemen
were
no
longer
to
be
seen
they
must
have
ridden
off
beyond
the
range
of
vision
i
was
about
to
seek
my
comrade
and
communicate
to
him
what
had
passed
when
on
rising
to
my
feet
i
found
him
standing
by
my
side
he
had
been
all
around
the
summit
without
seeing
aught
and
had
returned
to
satisfy
himself
that
the
guerrilla
were
still
quiet
hillow
he
exclaimed
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
what
the
darnation
yonder
a
drove
o
wild
hosses
it
mighty
strange
them
niggers
do
notice
by
the
etarnal
i
know
not
what
garey
meant
to
have
said
his
words
were
drowned
by
the
wild
yell
that
broke
simultaneously
from
the
mexican
line
and
the
next
moment
the
whole
troop
were
seen
springing
to
their
saddles
and
putting
themselves
in
motion
we
of
course
supposed
that
they
had
just
discovered
the
caballada
of
and
it
was
that
that
was
producing
this
sudden
stampede
what
was
our
astonishment
on
perceiving
that
we
ourselves
were
the
cause
of
the
alarm
for
the
guerrilleros
instead
of
fronting
to
the
plain
rode
closer
up
to
the
cliff
and
screaming
wildly
fired
their
carbines
at
among
the
rest
we
could
distinguish
the
great
gun
of
el
zorro
and
the
hiss
of
its
leaden
bullet
as
it
passed
close
to
our
ears
we
were
puzzled
at
first
to
know
how
they
had
discovered
us
a
glance
explained
that
the
moon
had
risen
higher
in
the
heavens
and
the
shadow
cast
by
the
mound
had
been
gradually
foreshortened
while
gazing
out
at
the
caballada
we
had
incautiously
kept
our
feet
and
our
figures
magnified
to
gigantic
proportions
were
thrown
forward
upon
the
plain
directly
under
the
eyes
of
our
enemies
they
had
but
to
look
up
to
see
us
where
we
stood
instantly
we
knelt
down
among
the
bushes
clutching
our
rifles
the
surprise
occasioned
by
our
appearance
upon
the
cliff
seemed
to
have
deprived
our
enemies
for
the
moment
of
their
habitual
prudence
as
several
of
them
rode
boldly
within
range
perhaps
they
were
some
of
the
late
arrivals
in
the
dark
shadow
we
could
not
make
out
their
forms
but
one
had
the
misfortune
to
be
mounted
on
a
white
horse
and
that
guided
the
trapper
aim
i
saw
him
glancing
along
his
barrel
and
heard
the
sharp
crack
i
fancied
i
heard
a
stifled
groan
from
below
and
the
next
moment
the
white
horse
was
seen
galloping
out
into
the
moonlight
but
the
rider
was
no
longer
upon
his
back
another
cloud
passed
over
the
moon
and
the
plain
was
again
shrouded
from
our
sight
garey
was
proceeding
to
reload
when
a
cry
arose
amidst
the
darkness
that
caused
him
to
pause
and
listen
the
cry
was
again
repeated
and
then
uttered
continuously
with
that
wild
intonation
which
can
alone
proceed
from
the
throat
of
the
savage
it
was
not
the
guerrilla
that
was
uttering
that
cry
it
was
the
yell
of
the
indian
warrior
comanche
cried
garey
after
listening
a
moment
comanche
by
the
etarnal
hooraw
the
injuns
are
upon
amidst
the
cries
we
could
hear
the
rapid
trampling
of
horses
and
the
ground
appeared
to
vibrate
under
the
quick
heavy
tread
each
moment
the
strokes
sounded
nearer
the
savages
were
charging
the
guerrilla
the
moon
shot
forth
from
the
cloud
there
was
no
longer
a
doubt
the
were
mounted
each
carried
an
indian
naked
to
the
waist
his
painted
body
glaring
red
in
the
moonlight
and
terrible
to
behold
by
this
time
the
mexicans
had
all
mounted
and
faced
towards
the
unexpected
foe
but
with
evident
signs
of
irresolution
in
their
ranks
they
would
never
stand
the
charge
no
never
so
said
garey
and
he
was
right
the
savages
had
advanced
within
less
than
a
hundred
paces
of
the
mexican
line
when
they
were
observed
to
pull
suddenly
up
it
was
but
a
momentary
halt
just
time
enough
to
enable
them
to
mark
the
formation
of
their
foes
and
send
a
flight
of
arrows
into
their
midst
that
done
they
dashed
onward
uttering
their
wild
yells
and
brandishing
their
long
spears
the
guerrilleros
only
waited
to
discharge
their
carbines
and
escopettes
they
did
not
think
of
reloading
most
of
them
flung
away
their
guns
as
soon
as
they
had
fired
and
the
retreat
began
the
whole
troop
turned
its
back
upon
the
enemy
and
spurring
their
horses
to
a
gallop
came
sweeping
round
the
base
of
the
mesa
in
headlong
flight
the
indians
uttering
their
demoniac
yells
followed
as
fast
they
were
rendered
more
furious
that
their
hated
foe
was
likely
to
escape
them
the
latter
were
indebted
to
us
for
having
put
them
upon
the
alert
but
for
that
circumstance
the
indians
would
have
charged
them
while
dismounted
and
far
different
might
have
been
their
fate
mounted
and
ready
for
flight
most
of
them
would
probably
get
clear
the
moment
we
saw
the
direction
the
chase
was
about
to
take
garey
and
i
rushed
across
the
summit
to
the
other
side
on
arriving
at
the
brow
of
the
precipice
our
view
was
perfect
and
we
could
see
both
parties
as
they
passed
along
its
base
directly
below
us
both
were
riding
in
straggling
clumps
and
scarcely
two
hundred
paces
separated
the
rearmost
of
the
pursued
from
the
headmost
of
the
pursuers
the
latter
still
uttered
their
while
the
former
now
rode
in
silence
their
breath
bound
and
their
voices
hushed
in
the
deathlike
stillness
of
terror
all
at
once
a
cry
arose
from
the
guerrilla
short
quick
and
despairing
the
voice
of
some
new
consternation
at
the
same
moment
the
whole
troop
were
seen
to
pull
up
we
looked
for
the
cause
of
this
extraordinary
conduct
our
eyes
and
ears
both
guided
us
to
the
explanation
from
the
opposite
direction
and
scarcely
three
hundred
yards
distant
appeared
a
band
of
horsemen
coming
up
at
a
gallop
they
were
right
in
the
moon
eye
and
we
could
see
glancing
arms
and
hear
loud
voices
the
hoofs
could
be
heard
pounding
the
prairie
and
my
companion
and
i
recognised
the
heavy
tread
of
the
american
horse
still
more
certain
were
we
about
that
hoarse
hurrah
neither
indian
nor
mexican
could
have
uttered
that
shout
hooraw
the
rangers
cried
garey
as
he
echoed
the
cry
at
the
full
pitch
of
his
voice
the
guerrilleros
stupified
by
surprise
at
sight
of
this
new
enemy
had
paused
for
a
moment
no
doubt
fancying
it
was
another
party
of
indians
their
halt
was
of
short
duration
the
dim
light
favoured
them
rifles
already
played
upon
their
ranks
and
suddenly
wheeling
to
the
left
they
struck
out
into
the
open
plain
the
indians
seeing
them
turn
off
leaned
into
the
diagonal
line
to
intercept
them
but
the
rangers
already
close
up
had
just
made
a
similar
movement
and
savage
and
saxon
were
now
obliquing
towards
each
other
the
moon
that
for
some
minutes
had
been
yielding
but
a
faint
light
became
suddenly
eclipsed
by
a
cloud
and
the
darkness
was
now
greater
than
ever
garey
and
i
saw
no
more
of
the
strife
but
we
heard
the
shock
of
the
opposing
bands
we
heard
the
of
the
savage
mingling
with
the
ranger
vengeful
shout
we
heard
the
crack
crack
crack
of
yager
rifles
and
the
quick
detonations
of
revolvers
the
clashing
of
upon
the
ring
of
breaking
steel
the
neighing
of
steeds
the
victor
cry
of
triumph
and
the
deep
anguished
groan
of
the
victim
with
anxious
hearts
and
nerves
excited
to
their
utmost
we
stood
upon
the
cliff
and
listened
to
these
sounds
of
dread
import
not
long
did
they
last
the
fierce
struggle
was
soon
over
when
the
moon
gleamed
forth
again
the
battle
was
ended
prostrate
forms
both
of
man
and
horse
were
lying
upon
the
plain
far
to
the
south
a
dark
clump
was
seen
disappearing
over
the
edge
it
was
the
cowardly
guerrilla
to
the
west
horsemen
galloped
away
alone
or
in
straggling
groups
but
the
cheer
of
triumph
that
reached
us
from
the

chapter
forty

a
chapter
of
explanations
the
fight
could
not
have
lasted
more
than
ten
minutes
the
whole
skirmish
had
the
semblance
of
a
moonlight
dream
interrupted
by
interludes
of
darkness
so
rapid
had
been
the
movements
of
the
forces
engaged
that
after
the
first
fire
not
a
gun
was
reloaded
as
for
the
guerrilleros
the
indian
seemed
to
have
shaken
the
pieces
out
of
their
hands
for
the
ground
where
they
had
first
broken
off
was
literally
strewed
with
carbines
escopettes
and
lances
the
great
gun
of
el
zorro
was
found
among
the
spoils
notwithstanding
the
shortness
of
the
affair
it
proved
sufficiently
tragical
to
both
mexicans
and
indians
five
of
the
guerrilleros
had
bit
the
dust
and
twice
that
number
of
savage
warriors
lay
lifeless
upon
the
plain
their
bodies
glaring
under
the
red
as
if
shrouded
in
blood
the
mexicans
lay
near
the
foot
of
the
mesa
having
fallen
under
the
first
fire
of
the
rangers
delivered
as
they
galloped
up
the
indians
were
farther
out
upon
the
plain
where
they
had
dropped
to
the
thick
rapid
detonations
of
the
revolvers
that
so
long
as
the
warriors
held
their
ground
played
upon
them
with
fearful
effect
they
may
have
heard
of
this
weapon
and
perhaps
have
seen
a
revolver
in
the
hands
of
some
trapper
or
traveller
but
to
my
knowledge
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
ever
encountered
a
band
of
men
armed
with
so
terrible
a
power
to
destroy
for
the
rangers
were
indeed
the
first
military
organisation
that
carried
colt
pistol
into
battle
the
high
cost
of
the
arm
having
deterred
the
government
from
extending
it
to
other
branches
of
the
service
nor
did
the
rangers
themselves
come
unscathed
out
of
the
fight
two
had
dropped
out
of
their
saddles
pierced
by
the
comanche
spear
while
nearly
a
dozen
were
more
or
less
severely
wounded
by
arrows
while
quackenboss
was
climbing
the
cliff
garey
and
i
found
time
to
talk
over
the
strange
incidents
to
which
we
had
been
witness
we
were
aided
by
explanations
from
below
but
without
these
we
had
no
difficulty
in
comprehending
all
the
indians
were
a
band
of
comanches
as
their
had
already
made
known
to
us
their
arrival
on
the
ground
at
that
moment
was
purely
accidental
so
far
as
we
or
the
mexicans
were
concerned
it
was
a
and
upon
the
with
the
intention
of
reiving
a
rich
mexican
town
on
the
other
side
of
the
rio
grande
some
twenty
leagues
from
the
rancheria
their
spy
had
discovered
the
horsemen
by
the
mesa
and
made
them
out
to
be
mexicans
a
foe
which
the
lordly
comanche
holds
in
supreme
contempt
not
so
contemptible
in
his
eyes
are
mexican
horses
saddles
speckled
serapes
mangas
of
fine
cloth
breeches
arms
and
accoutrements
and
it
was
to
sweep
this
paraphernalia
that
the
attack
had
been
made
though
hereditary
hatred
of
the
spanish
race
old
as
the
conquest
and
revenge
for
more
recent
wrongs
were
of
themselves
sufficient
motives
to
have
impelled
the
indians
to
their
hostile
attempt
all
this
we
learned
from
one
of
their
braves
who
remained
wounded
upon
the
ground
and
who
upon
closer
examination
turned
out
to
be
a
mexican
captive
now
completely
indianised
fortunately
for
the
mexican
town
the
savages
thus
checked
abandoned
their
design
and
returned
to
their
mountain
fastnesses
sadly
humbled
the
rest
of
the
affair
was
still
of
easier
explanation
to
garey
and
myself
rube
as
we
conjectured
had
arrived
safe
at
the
rancheria
and
in
ten
minutes
after
his
story
had
been
told
fifty
rangers
with
holingsworth
at
their
head
rode
rapidly
for
the
mesa
rube
had
guided
them
with
his
usual
craft
like
the
indians
they
had
been
moving
forward
during
the
intervals
of
darkness
but
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
they
had
kept
the
mound
between
them
and
their
foe
and
trusting
to
this
advantage
were
in
hopes
of
taking
the
guerrilleros
by
surprise
they
had
approached
almost
within
charging
distance
when
the
of
the
savage
sounded
in
their
ears
and
they
were
met
by
the
retreating
band
knowing
that
all
who
came
that
way
must
be
enemies
they
delivered
their
fire
upon
the
approaching
horsemen
and
then
galloping
forward
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
painted
warriors
of
the
plains
the
mutual
surprise
of
rangers
and
indians
caused
by
the
unexpected
rencontre
proved
a
happy
circumstance
for
the
cowardly
guerrilla
who
during
the
short
halt
of
their
double
pursuers
and
the
confused
fight
that
followed
were
enabled
to
gallop
off
beyond
reach
of
pursuit
it
was
a
curious
conjecture
what
would
have
been
the
result
had
the
rangers
not
arrived
on
the
ground
certainly
the
indians
would
have
rescued
us
from
our
not
less
savage
foes
my
companion
and
i
might
have
remained
undiscovered
but
we
should
have
lost
our
precious
horses
as
it
was
we
were
soon
once
more
upon
their
backs
and
free
from
all
thought
of
peril
now
joyfully
turned
our
faces
towards
the
rancheria
wheatley
rode
by
my
side
holingsworth
with
a
party
remained
upon
the
ground
to
collect
the
spoils
and
bury
our
unfortunate
comrades
as
we
moved
away
i
turned
and
for
a
moment
gazed
back
on
the
scene
of
strife
i
saw
holingsworth
dismounted
on
the
plain
he
was
moving
among
the
bodies
of
the
five
guerrilleros
one
after
another
he
turned
them
over
till
the
moon
glared
upon
their
ghastly
features
so
odd
were
his
movements
and
so
earnest
did
he
appear
that
one
might
have
fancied
him
engaged
in
searching
for
a
fallen
friend
or
more
like
some
prowling
robber
intent
upon
stripping
the
dead
but
neither
object
was
his
on
the
contrary
he
was
searching
for
a
foe
he
found
him
not
after
scanning
the
features
of
all
five
he
was
seen
to
turn
away
and
the
unconcerned
manner
in
which
he
moved
from
the
spot
told
that
he
who
was
sought
was
not
among
the
slain
the
news
wheatley
news
cap
grand
news
by
thunder
it
appears
we
have
been
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
at
least
so
thinks
president
polk
they
say
we
reach
mexico
on
this
line
so
we
all
going
to
be
drawn
off
and
shipped
to
some
port
farther
down
the
gulf
vera
cruz
i
believe
ah
grand
news
indeed
i
do
like
it
a
bit
continued
wheatley
the
less
so
since
it
is
rumoured
that
old
and
ready
is
to
be
recalled
and
we
to
be
commanded
by
that
book
martinet
scott
it
shabby
treatment
of
taylor
after
what
the
old
vet
has
accomplished
they
afraid
of
him
setting
up
for
president
next
go
hang
their
politics
it
a
confounded
shame
by
thunder
i
could
partly
understand
wheatley
reluctance
to
be
ordered
upon
the
new
line
of
operations
the
gay
lieutenant
was
never
troubled
with
ennui
his
leisure
hours
he
contrived
to
pass
pleasantly
enough
in
company
with
conchita
the
plump
daughter
of
the
alcalde
more
than
once
i
had
unwittingly
interrupted
them
in
their
amorous
dalliance
the
rancheria
with
its
mud
huts
and
dusty
lanes
in
the
eyes
of
the
texan
was
a
city
of
gilded
palaces
its
streets
paved
with
gold
it
was
wheatley
heaven
and
conchita
was
the
angel
who
inhabited
it
little
as
either
he
or
i
had
liked
the
post
at
first
neither
of
us
desired
a
change
of
quarters
as
yet
no
order
had
arrived
to
call
the
picket
in
but
my
companion
affirmed
that
the
was
a
substantial
one
and
believed
that
we
might
expect
such
a
command
at
any
moment
what
say
they
of
me
i
inquired
of
you
cap
why
nothing
what
do
you
expect
them
to
say
of
you
surely
there
has
been
some
talk
about
my
absence
oh
that
no
not
a
word
at
least
at
for
the
simple
reason
that
you
not
yet
reported
missing
ah
that
is
good
news
but
how
why
the
truth
is
holingsworth
and
i
thought
we
might
serve
you
better
by
keeping
the
thing
dark
at
all
events
till
we
should
be
sure
you
were
dead
lost
we
had
given
up
all
hope
the
greaser
who
guided
you
out
brought
back
word
that
two
trappers
had
gone
after
you
from
his
description
i
knew
that
queer
old
case
rube
and
was
satisfied
that
if
anything
remained
of
you
he
was
the
man
to
find
it
thanks
my
friend
you
have
acted
wisely
your
discreet
conduct
will
save
me
a
world
of
mortification
no
other
news
i
inquired
after
a
pause
no
said
wheatley
none
worth
telling
oh
yes
he
continued
suddenly
recollecting
himself
there
is
a
bit
you
remember
those
greasers
that
used
to
loaf
about
the
village
when
we
first
came
well
they
gone
by
thunder
every
mother
son
of
them
clean
from
the
place
and
not
a
left
of
them
you
may
walk
through
the
whole
settlement
without
seeing
a
mexican
except
the
old
men
and
the
women
i
asked
the
alcalde
where
they
had
cleared
to
but
the
old
chap
only
shook
his
head
and
drawled
out
his
eternal
sabe
of
course
they
off
to
join
some
band
of
guerrillas
by
thunder
when
i
think
of
it
i
would
wonder
if
they
were
among
that
lot
we
just
scattered
sure
as
shootin
they
are
i
saw
holingsworth
examine
the
five
dead
ones
as
we
rode
off
he
know
them
i
guess
and
can
tell
us
if
any
of
our
old
acquaintances
are
among
them
knowing
more
of
this
matter
than
wheatley
himself
i
enlightened
him
as
to
the
guerrilleros
and
their
leader
thought
so
by
thunder
rafael
ijurra
no
wonder
holingsworth
was
so
keen
to
start
in
such
a
hurry
to
reach
the
mound
he
forgot
to
tell
me
who
we
were
after
deuce
take
it
what
fools
we
been
to
let
these
fellows
slide
we
should
have
strung
up
every
man
of
them
when
we
first
reached
the
place
we
should
by
thunder
for
some
minutes
we
rode
on
in
silence
twenty
times
a
question
was
upon
my
lips
but
i
refrained
from
putting
it
in
hopes
that
wheatley
might
have
something
more
to
tell
me
something
of
more
interest
than
aught
he
had
yet
communicated
he
remained
provokingly
silent
with
the
design
of
drawing
him
out
i
assumed
a
careless
air
and
inquired
have
we
had
no
visitors
at
the
post
any
one
from
the
camp
not
a
soul
replied
he
and
again
relapsed
into
meditative
silence
no
visitors
whatever
has
no
one
inquired
for
i
asked
determined
to
come
boldly
to
the
point
no
was
the
discouraging
oh
stay
oh
ah
yes
indeed
he
added
correcting
himself
while
i
could
perceive
that
he
spoke
in
a
peculiar
tone
yes
you
inquired
for
by
whom
asked
i
in
a
careless
drawl
well
that
i
ca
tell
answered
the
lieutenant
in
an
evident
tone
of
badinage
but
there
appears
to
be
mighty
uneasy
about
you
a
slip
of
a
mexican
boy
has
been
backward
and
forward
something
less
than
a
million
of
times
it
plain
somebody
sends
the
boy
but
he
a
close
little
shaver
that
same
he
wo
tell
either
who
sends
him
or
what
his
business
he
only
inquires
if
you
have
returned
and
looks
dead
down
in
the
mouth
when
he
told
no
i
have
noticed
that
he
comes
and
goes
on
the
that
leads
to
the
the
last
words
were
spoken
with
a
distinct
emphasis
we
might
have
arrested
the
little
fallow
as
a
spy
continued
wheatley
in
a
tone
of
quiet
irony
but
we
fancied
he
might
have
been
sent
by
some
friend
of
yours
the
speaker
concluded
with
another
marked
emphasis
and
under
the
moonlight
i
could
see
a
smile
playing
across
his
features
more
than
once
i
had
chaffed
my
lieutenant
about
conchita
he
was
having
his
revenge
i
was
not
in
a
mood
to
take
offence
my
companion
could
have
taken
any
liberty
with
me
at
that
moment
his
communication
had
fallen
like
sweet
music
upon
my
ears
and
i
rode
forward
with
the
proud
consciousness
that
i
was
not
forgotten
isolina
was
true
soon
after
my
eyes
rested
upon
a
shining
object
it
was
the
gilded
vane
of
the
little
capilla
and
beneath
glistened
the
white
vails
of
the
hacienda
bathed
in
the
milky
light
of
the
moon
my
heart
beat
with
strange
emotions
as
i
gazed
upon
the
mansion
and
thought
of
the
lovely
jewel
which
that
bright
casket
contained
was
she
asleep
did
she
dream
of
what
of
whom
was
she
dreaming
chapter
forty
four
dutch
lige
in
a
difficulty
the
soft
blue
light
of
morning
was
just
perceptible
along
the
eastern
horizon
as
we
rode
into
the
rancheria
i
no
longer
felt
hunger
some
of
the
more
provident
of
the
rangers
had
brought
with
them
haversacks
and
had
made
me
welcome
to
the
contents
from
their
canteens
i
had
satisfied
my
thirst
and
wheatley
as
usual
carried
his
free
flask
relieved
of
the
protracted
strain
upon
my
nerves
of
fear
and
vigil
i
felt
deadly
weary
and
scarcely
undressing
i
flung
myself
upon
my
leathern
and
at
once
fell
asleep
a
few
hours
repose
had
the
desired
effect
and
restored
both
the
strength
of
my
body
and
the
vigour
of
my
mind
i
awoke
full
of
health
and
hope
a
world
of
sweet
anticipations
was
before
me
the
sky
and
fortune
were
both
smiling
i
made
my
toilette
with
some
care
my
with
less
and
then
with
lighted
cigar
ascended
to
my
favourite
lounge
on
the
azotea
the
beautiful
captive
was
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
proudly
curving
his
neck
as
if
conscious
of
the
admiration
he
excited
the
rangers
the
poblanas
the
hucksters
of
the
piazza
even
some
sulky
leperos
stood
near
gazing
with
wondering
eyes
upon
the
splendid
present
thought
i
worthy
the
acceptance
of
a
princess
it
had
been
my
intention
to
make
the
offering
in
person
hence
the
care
bestowed
upon
my
toilette
after
more
mature
reflection
i
abandoned
this
design
i
was
influenced
by
a
variety
of
considerations
one
among
others
being
a
delicate
apprehension
that
a
persona
visit
from
me
might
compromise
the
family
at
the
hacienda
the
sentiment
was
every
day
growing
more
intense
even
the
acceptance
of
a
present
was
a
dangerous
matter
but
the
steed
was
not
to
be
a
gift
only
a
return
for
the
favourite
that
had
fallen
by
my
hand
and
i
was
not
to
appear
in
the
character
of
a
donor
my
sable
groom
therefore
would
convey
the
beautiful
captive
already
the
white
lazo
formed
into
a
halter
was
adjusted
around
the
head
and
the
negro
only
awaited
orders
to
lead
him
away
i
confess
that
at
that
moment
i
felt
somewhat
annoyed
at
the
publicity
of
my
affair
my
rough
rangers
were
men
of
keen
intelligence
i
could
tell
from
some
whispers
that
had
reached
me
that
one
and
all
of
them
knew
i
had
gone
upon
the
wild
hunt
and
i
dreaded
their
satire
i
would
have
given
something
at
that
moment
to
have
rendered
the
steed
invisible
to
have
been
able
to
transport
him
to
his
destination
under
cover
of
a
cloud
i
thought
of
waiting
for
the
friendly
shelter
of
night
just
then
however
an
incident
occurred
which
gave
me
the
very
opportunity
i
wanted
a
scene
so
ludicrous
that
the
steed
was
no
longer
the
cynosure
of
admiring
eyes
the
hero
of
this
scene
was
elijah
quackenboss
of
all
the
men
in
my
band
dutch
lige
was
the
worst
clad
not
that
there
was
less
money
expended
upon
his
outward
man
but
partly
from
his
ungainly
form
and
loose
untidy
habits
and
more
perhaps
from
the
wear
and
tear
caused
by
his
botanising
excursions
a
suit
of
broadcloth
did
not
keep
sound
upon
him
for
a
week
he
was
habitually
in
tatters
the
skirmish
of
the
night
had
been
profitable
to
lige
it
was
his
true
aim
that
had
brought
down
one
of
the
live
guerrilleros
on
his
asserting
this
his
comrades
had
laughed
at
it
as
an
idle
vaunt
but
quackenboss
proved
his
assertion
to
be
correct
by
picking
his
bullet
out
of
the
man
body
and
holding
it
up
before
their
eyes
the
peculiar
bore
of
his
rifle
rendered
the
bullet
easy
of
identification
and
all
agreed
that
lige
had
shot
his
man
by
the
laws
of
the
spoils
of
this
particular
individual
became
the
property
of
quackenboss
and
the
result
was
that
he
had
shaken
off
his
tattered
rags
and
now
appeared
in
the
piazza
in
full
mexican
costume
comprising
calzoneros
and
calzoncillos
sash
and
serape
jacket
and
glazed
hat
botas
with
gigantic
spurs
in
short
a
complete
set
of
ranchero
habiliments
never
was
such
a
pair
of
legs
encased
in
mexican
velveteens
never
were
two
such
arms
thrust
into
the
sleeves
of
an
embroidered
and
so
odd
was
the
of
the
ranger
thus
attired
that
his
appearance
in
the
piazza
was
hailed
by
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
both
from
his
comrades
and
the
natives
who
stood
around
even
the
gloomy
indians
showed
their
white
teeth
and
joined
in
the
general
chorus
but
this
was
not
the
end
among
other
spoils
lige
had
made
capture
of
a
comanche
mustang
and
as
his
own
had
been
for
a
long
time
on
the
decline
this
afforded
him
an
excellent
opportunity
for
a
remount
some
duty
of
the
day
had
called
him
forth
and
he
now
appeared
in
the
piazza
leading
the
mustang
to
which
he
had
transferred
his
own
saddle
and
bridle
a
fine
handsome
horse
it
appeared
more
than
one
of
his
comrades
envied
him
this
splendid
prize
the
laughter
had
scarcely
subsided
when
the
order
was
given
to
mount
and
with
others
quackenboss
sprang
to
his
horse
but
his
hips
were
hardly
snug
in
the
saddle
when
the
wicked
comanche
humped
his
back
and
entered
upon
a
round
of
kicking
which
seemed
to
exhibit
every
pose
and
attitude
of
equestrian
exercise
first
his
hind
feet
then
his
fore
ones
then
all
together
could
be
seen
glancing
in
the
air
now
a
hoof
whizzed
past
the
ear
of
the
affrighted
rider
now
a
set
of
teeth
threatened
his
thighs
while
every
moment
he
appeared
in
danger
of
being
hurled
with
violence
to
the
earth
the
sombrero
had
long
since
parted
from
his
head
and
the
rifle
from
his
hand
and
what
with
the
flapping
of
the
wide
trousers
the
waving
of
the
loose
serape
the
dancing
of
the
steel
scabbard
the
distracted
motion
of
the
rider
arms
his
lank
streaming
hair
and
look
of
terror
all
combined
to
form
a
spectacle
sufficiently
ludicrous
and
the
whole
crowd
was
convulsed
with
laughter
while
the
piazza
rang
with
such
shouts
as
bravo
well
done
lige
hooraw
for
you
old
beeswax
but
what
surprised
his
comrades
was
the
fact
that
quackenboss
still
kept
his
seat
it
was
well
known
that
he
was
the
worst
rider
in
the
troop
yet
despite
all
the
doubling
and
flinging
of
the
mustang
that
had
now
lasted
for
several
minutes
he
was
still
safe
in
the
saddle
he
was
winning
golden
opinions
upon
the
strength
of
his
splendid
horsemanship
the
rangers
were
being
astonished
all
at
once
however
this
mystery
was
explained
and
the
cause
of
his
firm
seat
discovered
one
of
the
bystanders
sharper
than
the
rest
had
chanced
to
look
under
the
belly
of
the
mustang
and
the
next
moment
shouted
out
hoy
look
yonder
by
geehorum
spars
are
all
eyes
were
lowered
and
a
fresh
peal
of
laughter
broke
forth
from
the
crowd
as
they
perceived
that
this
was
in
reality
the
case
lige
upon
mounting
under
the
suspicion
that
the
mustang
was
disposed
for
a
fling
had
clutched
firmly
with
his
legs
and
these
on
account
of
their
extreme
length
completely
enveloped
the
body
of
the
animal
so
that
his
heels
met
underneath
he
had
forgotten
his
new
spurs
the
rowels
of
which
six
inches
in
diameter
irritated
the
mustang
and
were
no
doubt
the
cause
of
such
violent
kicking
these
after
a
few
turns
had
got
locked
and
of
course
held
quackenboss
as
firmly
as
if
he
had
been
strapped
to
the
saddle
but
as
the
rowels
were
now
buried
in
the
ribs
of
the
mustang
the
fierce
brute
maddened
with
the
pain
only
grew
more
furious
at
each
fling
and
it
was
natural
enough
he
should
do
his
utmost
to
rid
himself
of
so
cruel
a
rider
how
long
he
might
have
kept
up
the
pitching
frolic
before
his
involuntary
tormentor
could
have
freed
himself
is
a
matter
of
conjecture
it
would
have
been
an
unfortunate
fix
to
have
been
placed
in
alone
upon
the
prairies
lige
however
found
a
compassionate
bystander
who
having
flung
his
lazo
around
the
neck
of
the
mustang
brought
the
spectacle
to
a
termination
chapter
forty
five
a
lover
on
the
trail
taking
advantage
of
the
distraction
caused
by
quackenboss
and
his
troubles
i
despatched
the
black
upon
his
interesting
errand
and
with
no
slight
anxiety
awaited
the
result
from
my
position
on
the
roof
i
saw
my
messenger
climb
the
hill
leading
the
proud
steed
and
saw
him
enter
the
great
portal
of
the
hacienda
promptly
almost
directly
the
groom
came
out
again
the
horse
the
present
had
been
accepted
so
far
well
i
counted
the
moments
till
heavy
footsteps
were
heard
upon
the
escalera
and
a
shining
black
face
rose
over
the
roof
there
was
no
letter
no
message
beyond
i
felt
a
pang
of
chagrin
i
had
expected
thanks
more
formal
than
this
mere
phrase
of
compliment
my
man
appeared
better
satisfied
a

gleamed
in
his

i
could
have
broken
the
rascal
thick
skull
but
that
the
queenly
douceur
gave
proof
of
the
satisfaction
with
which
my
offering
had
been
received
even
on
this
trivial
circumstance
i
built
my
hopes
of
yet
receiving
a
fuller
meed
of
thanks
absorbed
in
these
hopes
i
continued
to
pace
the
azotea
alone
it
was
a
de
in
the
rancheria
bells
had
already
commenced
their
clangour
and
other
notes
of
rejoicing
fell
upon
the
ear
the
poblanas
appeared
in
their
gayest
attire
the
indians
in
bright
naguas
with
red
and
purple
threads
twisted
in
their
black
hair
the
denizens
of
the
ranchitos
were
pouring
into
the
piazza
and
processions
were
being
formed
by
the
church
were
twanging
their
music
and
pyrotechnic
machines
were
set
up
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
saints
were
carried
about
on
the
shoulders
of
painted
maskers
and
there
were
pilate
and
the
centurion
and
the
saviour
a
spectacle
absurd
and
unnatural
and
yet
a
spectacle
that
may
be
witnessed
every
week
in
a
mexican
village
and
which
with
but
slight
variation
has
been
exhibited
every
week
for
three
centuries
i
had
no
eyes
for
this
disgusting
fanfarronade
of
a
degrading
superstition
sick
of
the
sight
wearied
with
the
sounds
i
had
given
orders
for
my
horse
to
be
saddled
intending
to
ride
forth
and
seek
repose
for
my
spirit
amid
the
silent
glades
of
the
chapparal
while
waiting
for
my
steed
an
object
came
under
my
eyes
that
quickened
the
beatings
of
my
pulse
my
gaze
had
been
long
turned
in
one
direction
upon
the
hacienda
of
don
ramon
de
vargas
just
then
i
saw
emerging
from
its
gate
and
passing
rapidly
down
the
hill
a
horse
with
a
rider
upon
his
back
the
colour
of
this
horse
and
the
scarlet
manga
of
the
rider
both
contrasting
with
the
green
of
the
surrounding
landscape
could
not
escape
observation
even
at
that
distance
and
my
eyes
at
once
caught
the
bright
object
i
hesitated
not
to
form
my
conclusion
it
was
the
white
steed
i
saw
and
the
rider
i
remembered
the
manga
as
when
first
my
eyes
rested
upon
that
fair
form
the
rider
was
isolina
she
was
passing
down
the
slope
that
stretched
from
the
hacienda
to
the
river
and
the
minute
after
the
thick
foliage
of
the
platanus
trees
shrouded
the
shining
meteor
from
my
sight
i
noticed
that
she
halted
a
moment
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
fancied
that
she
gazed
earnestly
towards
the
village
but
the
road
she
had
taken
led
almost
in
the
opposite
direction
i
chafed
with
impatience
for
my
horse
my
resolve
made
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
was
to
follow
the
white
steed
and
his
rider
once
in
the
saddle
i
hurried
out
of
the
piazza
passed
the
ranchos
of
yucca
and
reaching
the
open
country
pressed
my
horse
into
a
gallop
my
road
lay
up
the
river
through
a
heavily
timbered
bottom
of
gum
and
these
were
thickly
beset
with
the
curious
whose
silvery
festoons
stretching
from
branch
to
branch
shrouded
the
sun
causing
amongst
the
the
obscurity
of
twilight
in
the
midst
of
one
of
these
shadowy
aisles
i
met
or
passed
some
one
i
saw
that
it
was
a
mexican
boy
but
the
sombre
light
and
the
rapidity
with
which
i
was
riding
prevented
me
from
noting
anything
more
the
lad
shouted
after
me
uttering
some
words
which
were
drowned
by
the
of
my
horse
i
deemed
it
some
expression
of
boyish
and
without
heeding
it
rode
on
not
until
far
out
of
sight
and
hearing
did
it
occur
to
me
that
i
knew
the
voice
and
the
lad
i
recollected
a
sort
of
attached
to
the
hacienda
and
whom
i
had
seen
more
than
once
at
the
rancheria
i
now
remembered
the
badinage
of
wheatley
and
would
have
returned
to
question
the
youth
but
i
had
left
him
too
far
in
the
rear
after
a
moment
reflection
i
spurred
on
i
soon
arrived
at
the
base
of
the
hill
on
which
stood
the
hacienda
and
here
leaving
the
main
road
i
followed
a
that
skirted
the
hill
a
few
hundred
yards
brought
me
to
the
spot
where
i
had
last
observed
the
object
of
my
pursuit
the
of
the
white
horse
now
guided
me
and
upon
his
trail
i
entered
the
woods
for
some
distance
it
followed
a
path
a
but
all
at
once
it
diverged
from
this
and
struck
off
into
a
heavily
timbered
bottom
where
not
the
semblance
of
path
existed
keeping
the
trace
in
view
i
rode
after
as
i
advanced
the
timber
grew
thicker
and
the
path
more
difficult
a
close
underwood
of
arundinaria
and
sabal
palms
shut
up
the
way
and
the
view
trailing
roots
obstructed
progress
below
while
higher
up
the
trelliswork
of
llianas
bamboo
briars
sarsaparilla
and
gigantic
rendered
it
necessary
to
bend
down
in
the
saddle
in
order
to
pass
onward
to
my
surprise
i
noticed
all
this
for
what
purpose
could
she
have
chosen
such
a
path
was
it
indeed
isolina
i
had
seen
a
white
horse
and
a
scarlet
manga
are
not
uncommon
things
in
mexico
it
might
not
be
but
the
i
dismounted
and
examined
it
i
knew
it
at
a
glance
it
was
that
of
the
noble
steed
and
the
rider
could
be
no
other
than
isolina
de
vargas
no
longer
in
doubt
though
still
wondering
i
followed
the
tracks
for
a
or
more
the
path
meandered
through
thick
forest
here
turning
around
some
giant
trunk
there
diverging
to
the
right
or
left
to
avoid
the
impervious
network
of
canes
and
llianas
at
length
it
began
to
slope
upwards
and
i
perceived
by
the
ascent
that
i
was
climbing
a
hill
the
woods
became
more
open
as
i
advanced
here
and
there
alternating
with
glades
the
trees
were
of
slender
growth
and
the
foliage
lighter
and
thinner
i
was
no
longer
among
the
heavy
trunks
of
platanus
and
liquidambar
the
were
the
prevailing
trees
and
many
beautiful
forms
of
inga
acacia
and
mimosa
grew
around
myrtles
too
mingled
their
foliage
with
wild
limes
their
branches
twined
with
flowering
parasites
as
the
climbing
with
its
long
clusters
convolvuli
with
large
white
blossoms
and
the
beautiful
bauhinia
it
was
a
wild
garden
of
flowers
a
shrubbery
of
nature
own
planting
the
eye
wandering
through
the
vistas
and
glades
beheld
almost
every
form
of
inflorescence
there
were
the
bignonias
convolvuli
in
pendulous
bells
syngenesists
disposed
in
spreading
umbels
and
over
them
closely
set
upon
tall
spikes
rose
the
showy
blossoms
of
the
bromelias
aloes
and
even
from
the
tops
of
the
highest
trees
hung
gaudy
catkins
wafted
to
and
fro
by
the
light
breeze
mingling
their
sheen
and
their
perfume
with
the
floral
and
parasites
that
clustered
around
the
branches
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
these
flowers
are
gifted
with
life
and
enjoy
during
their
short
and
transient
existence
both
pleasure
and
pain
the
bright
warm
sun
is
their
happiness
while
the
cold
cloudy
sky
is
the
reflection
of
their
misery
as
i
rode
onward
another
reflection
passed
through
my
mind
it
was
caused
by
my
perceiving
that
the
atmosphere
was
charged
with
pleasant
perfumes
literally
loaded
with
fragrance
i
perceived
moreover
that
the
same
breeze
carried
upon
its
breath
the
sweet
music
of
birds
whose
notes
sounded
clear
soft
and
harmonious
what
hath
asserted
that
the
flowers
of
this
fair
land
are
devoid
of
fragrance
that
its
birds
though
brightly
plumed
are
songless
ah
monsieur
buffon
with
all
your
eloquence
such
presumptive
assertion
will
one
day
strip
you
of
half
your
fame
you
could
never
have
approached
within
two
hundred
paces
of
a
of
the
of
the
with
its
mantle
of
blossoms
you
could
never
have
passed
near
the
pothos
plant
the
serbereae
and
tabernamon
taneae
the
callas
eugenias
ocotas
and
nictiginas
you
could
never
have
ridden
through
a
chapparal
of
acacias
and
mimosas
among
orchids
whose
presence
fills
whole
forests
with
fragrant
aroma
and
more
monsieur
you
could
never
have
listened
to
the
incomparable
melody
of
the
the
full
charming
notes
of
the
blue
the
sweet
warbling
voices
of
the
silvias
finches
and
tanagers
that
not
only
adorn
the
american
woods
with
their
gorgeous
colours
but
make
them
vocal
with
song
no
monsieur
you
could
never
have
inhaled
the
perfume
of
these
flowers
nor
listed
to
the
melody
of
these
sweet
songsters
and
sad
it
was
of
you
and
silly
as
sad
to
have
yielded
to
the
prejudice
of
a
slender
spirit
and
denied
their
existence
both
exist
the
singing
birds
and
the
fragrant
flowers
both
exist
and
thou
art
gone
on
such
reflections
i
dwelt
but
for
a
moment
they
were
merely
the
natural
impressions
of
surrounding
objects
sensations
almost
instantaneously
passing
away
the
soul
benighted
with
love
has
neither
eye
nor
ear
for
aught
beyond
the
object
of
its
passion
from
the
contemplation
of
that
only
does
it
derive
pleasure
and
even
the
fairest
pictures
of
nature
may
be
spread
before
it
without
challenging
observation
it
was
only
that
the
one
through
which
i
was
passing
was
of
such
transcendent
beauty
so
like
to
some
scene
of
paradise
that
i
could
not
help
regarding
it
with
momentary
admiration
but
my
eyes
soon
returned
to
the
earth
and
once
more
taking
up
the
trace
of
the
steed
i
rode
on
i
had
advanced
near
the
summit
the
tracks
were
quite
recent
the
branches
that
had
been
touched
by
the
flanks
of
the
horse
had
not
yet
ceased
to
vibrate
the
rider
could
not
be
far
in
advance
i
fancied
i
heard
the
silently
i
pressed
on
expecting
every
moment
to
catch
the
gleam
of
the
scarlet
manga
or
the
white
sheen
of
the
steed
a
few
paces
farther
and
both
were
under
my
eyes
glittering
through
the
feathery
frondage
of
the
mimosas
i
had
followed
the
true
track
the
rider
was
isolina
i
saw
that
she
had
halted
she
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
growth
of
timber
ceased
an
opening
of
about
an
acre
there
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
flowery
woods
the
very
of
a
summer
glade
the
open
summit
commanded
a
view
of
the
surrounding
country
for
the
hill
was
a
high
one
while
the
charming
spot
itself
enjoyed
perfect
privacy
and
repose
in
this
glade
she
had
drawn
up
and
was
sitting
silently
in
the
saddle
as
if
to
enjoy
the
warbling
of
birds
the
hum
of
the
bees
and
the
fragrance
of
flowers
i
myself
drew
rein
and
remained
for
some
moments
in
a
state
of
hesitancy
as
to
whether
i
should
ride
forward
or
go
back
a
feeling
of
shame
was
upon
me
and
i
believe
i
would
have
turned
my
horse
and
stolen
gently
away
but
just
then
i
saw
the
fair
rider
draw
forth
from
her
bosom
something
that
glittered
in
the
sun
it
was
a
watch
and
she
appeared
to
note
the
time
i
observed
that
she
looked
anxiously
over
the
tops
of
the
low
trees
in
the
direction
of
the
plain
below
these
circumstances
trivial
as
they
might
appear
produced
within
me
a
quick
sense
of
pain
i
felt
as
if
hot
steel
was
passing
through
my
heart
i
had
ridden
to
my
ruin
i
had
followed
to
be
present
at
an
assignation
thus
only
could
i
explain
the
solitary
ride
and
by
such
difficult
and
devious
paths
thus
only
could
i
account
for
the
anxious
glance
the
ear
acutely
bent
beyond
a
doubt
she
was
listening
for
the
footsteps
of
a
lover
the
rein
fell
from
my
fingers
i
sat
irresolute
i
scarcely
breathed
my
heart
felt
cold
and
feeble
the
birds
mocked
me
the
parrots
screeched
his
name
the
in
hoarse
concert
cried
out
the
name
nerved
me
as
blood
knits
the
sinews
of
the
tiger
once
more
my
fingers
closed
upon
my
bridle
my
feet
became
firm
in
the
stirrups
and
heart
and
arm
swelled
to
their
full
strength
was
but
a
light
rapier
that
hung
against
my
thigh
no
matter
he
might
be
no
better
weaponed
but
even
armed
from
head
to
heel
i
feared
him
not
three
passions
hatred
jealousy
and
revenge
supplied
an
arm
of
treble
strength
and
under
the
influence
of
these
i
felt
bold
and
sure
of
conquest
yes
i
felt
at
that
moment
as
though
i
could
have
slain
my
hated
rival
with
my
naked
hands
i
was
no
longer
troubled
with
scruples
of
etiquette
no
this
monster
owed
me
satisfaction
life
itself
he
had
striven
to
take
mine
and
now
his
should
be
forfeit
to
my
vengeance
on
that
spot
even
in
her
presence
should
he
die
or
i
myself
become
the
victim
the
two
of
us
should
never
go
thence
alive
oh
that
he
may
reach
the
ground
while
my
blood
is
thus
hot
and
my
hand
ready
the
fierce
thoughts
stirring
within
me
must
have
roused
my
horse
for
at
that
moment
he
tossed
his
head
and
neighed
wildly
a
response
came
like
an
echo
from
the
glade
and
the
instant
after
a
voice
called
quien
concealment
was
no
longer
possible
i
saw
that
i
was
observed
and
spurring
my
horse
into
the
open
ground
i
rode
up
and
halted
face
to
face
with
isolina
chapter
forty
six
a
declaration
on
horseback
face
to
face
with
my
beautiful
brunette
her
eyes
flashed
upon
me
with
an
expression
of
surprise
i
felt
abashed
by
the
glance
my
conduct
was
not
i
bethought
me
of
an
apology
what
excuse
could
i
offer
for
such
unceremonious
intrusion
accident
she
would
not
believe
it
the
time
and
the
place
were
against
such
a
supposition
with
an
intellect
like
hers
it
would
be
idle
to
adopt
so
shallow
an
artifice
no
i
would
not
dissemble
i
would
boldly
avow
the
truth
jealousy
had
rendered
me
reckless
of
the
result
said
she
interrupting
my
hurried
reflections
where
is
your
guide
how
have
you
found
this
place
easily
enough
senorita
i
followed
the
tracks
of
your
horse
but
so
soon
i
did
not
expect
you
no
you
expected
another
certainly
i
thought
cyprio
would
arrive
before
you
cyprio
cyprio
yes
cyprio
senorita
if
this
be
another
name
for
your
protean
cousin
i
have
to
say
it
will
be
better
for
him
he
should
not
arrive
at
all
my
cousin
better
not
arrive
holy
trinity
capitan
i
do
not
comprehend
you
her
large
brown
eyes
were
rolling
in
astonishment
i
was
as
much
puzzled
as
she
but
i
had
begun
my
explanation
and
was
determined
to
carry
it
to
the
end
then
senorita
de
vargas
i
shall
be
more
explicit
if
rafael
ijurra
appear
upon
this
ground
either
he
or
i
leave
it
not
alive
he
has
attempted
my
life
and
i
have
vowed
to
take
his
whenever
and
wherever
i
may
meet
him
pray
heaven
you
may
keep
your
vow

cousin

cousin

worst
foe

direst
enemy

our
house

little
timid
though
i
be
i
should
not
desire

be
here
alone
with
rafael
ijurra
lady
you
astonish
me
pray
explain
gallant
capitan
is
you
who
need
explain
i
sought
this
interview
to
thank
you
for
your
noble
gift
you
meet
me
with
anger
in
your
eye
and
bitter
words
upon
your
tongue
you
sought
this
interview
say
you
so
lady
certainly
i
did
for
reasons
already
known
to
you
i
dared
not
invite
you
to
our
house
so
i
have
chosen
this
pretty
glade
for
my
how
do
you
like
it
cavallero
in
your
society
senorita
the
rudest
spot
would
appear
a
paradise
again
the
poet
tongue
ah
capitan
remember
the
yellow
domino
no
more
flattery
i
pray
we
are
no
longer
face
to
face
let
us
be
candid
with
each
other
with
all
my
heart
i
accept
the
conditions
candour
is
the
very
thing
i
desire
for
to
say
the
truth
i
came
prepared
for
a
confession
a
confession
precisely
so
but
since
you
are
an
advocate
for
candour
may
i
first
ask
a
question
ho
you
wish
to
play
the
confessor
with
me
i
do
senorita
bravo
capitan
proceed
i
shall
answer
you
in
all
sincerity
then
lady
what
i
would
ask
first
who
is
this
cyprio
whom
you
expected
cyprio
ha
ha
ha
who
should
cyprio
be
but
my
mozo
he
who
carried
my
message
to
you
why
do
you
put
such
a
question
he
who
carried
your
message
to
me
of
course
yonder
is
the
himself
hola
cyprio
you
may
return
to
the
house
capitan
both
he
and
you
must
have
sped
well
i
did
not
expect
you
for
but
you
soldiers
are
soon
in
the
saddle
so
much
the
better
for
it
is
getting
late
and
i
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
you
a
light
had
broken
upon
me
was
cyprio
i
had
passed
in
the
forest
shade
the
boy
was
the
bearer
of
a
message
hence
his
having
hailed
me
was
i
who
was
expected
to
keep
the
assignation
was
i
for
whom
the
timepiece
had
been
consulted
for
whom
those
earnest
glances
had
been
given
the
bitter
moments
were
past
and
my
heart
swelled
anew
with
proud
and
pleasant
emotions
as
yet
she
knew
not
that
i
had
come
without
invitation
cyprio
at
the
word
of
command
had
gone
off
without
making
any
reply
and
my
prompt
appearance
upon
the
ground
was
still
unexplained
i
was
about
to
account
for
it
and
offer
some
apology
for
my
brusque
behaviour
when
i
was
challenged
to
the
confession
i
had
just
promised
minor
thoughts
gave
way
before
the
important
purpose
i
had
formed
and
to
which
the
banter
now
recalled
me
so
fair
an
opportunity
might
never
offer
again
in
the
vicissitudes
of
a
soldier
life
the
chance
of
should
not
be
disregarded
may
bring
change
either
in
the
scene
or
the
circumstances
and
i
was
skilled
enough
in
to
know
that
an
hour
unimproved
is
often
followed
by
an
age
of
regrets
but
in
truth
i
do
some
wrong
to
my
character
i
was
but
little
under
the
influence
of
such
cunning
cognisance
at
that
moment
i
acted
not
by
volition
but
rather
under
pressure
of
a
passion
that
held
complete
mastery
over
my
will
and
compelled
me
to
the
declaration
i
was
about
to
make
it
was
simple
enough
three
little
words
in
either
of
the
two
sweet
tongues
in
which
we
understood
each
other
i
chose
the
one
of
all
others
most
attuned
to
the
tones
of
the
loving
heart
and
bending
low
to
that
fair
face
and
gazing
into
the
liquid
depths
of
those
large
inquiring
eyes
i
whispered
the
sweet
though
phrase
te
the
words
quivered
upon
my
lips
but
their
tone
proved
the
sincerity
in
which
i
had
spoken
no
doubt
it
was
further
manifest
by
the
earnestness
of
my
manner
as
i
awaited
her
reply
the
habitual
smile
had
departed
from
her
lips
the
damask
red
deepened
and
mounted
higher
upon
her
cheeks
the
dark
fringes
drooped
downward
and
the
burning
orbs
beneath
the
face
of
the
gay
girl
had
suddenly
assumed
the
serious
air
of
womanhood
at
first
i
was
terrified
by
the
expression
and
could
scarcely
control
my
dread
but
i
drew
hope
from
the
flushed
cheek
the
roseate
neck
the
swelling
panting
bosom
strong
emotions
were
stirring
in
that
breast
oh
what
emotions
will
she
not
speak
will
she
not
declare
them
there
was
a
long
interval
of
silence
to
me
it
seemed
an
age
senor
she
said
at
length
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
that
voice
tremble
senor
you
promised
to
be
candid
you
have
been
so
are
you
equally
i
have
spoken
from
the
depth
of
my
soul
the
long
lashes
were
raised
and
the
gleamed
in
her
liquid
eyes
for
a
moment
it
burned
steadily
bathing
my
heart
as
with
balm
heaven
itself
could
not
have
shed
a
brighter
beam
upon
my
spirit
all
at
once
a
smile
played
upon
her
features
in
which
i
detected
or
fancied
so
the
gay
that
springs
from
indifference
to
me
it
was
another
moment
of
pain
she
continued
and
pray
capitan
what
would
you
have
do
i
felt
embarrassed
and
replied
not
would
you
have
me
declare
that
i
love
you
oh
you
can
not
you
do
not
you
have
not
asked
the
question
no
lady
i
too
much
dread
the
answer
ho
what
a
coward
you
have
grown
of
late
a
pity
i
am
not
masked
shall
i
draw
this
veil
ha
ha
ha
it
was
not
the
manner
of
love
love
laughs
not
my
heart
was
heavy
i
made
no
reply
but
with
eyes
upon
the
ground
sat
in
my
saddle
feeling
like
one
condemned
for
some
moments
her
laughter
rang
in
my
ears
as
i
fancied
in
mockery
her
sweet
silvery
voice
only
grated
upon
my
heart
oh
that
i
had
never
listened
to
its
siren
tones
i
heard
the
of
her
horse
and
looking
up
saw
that
she
was
moving
away
from
the
spot
was
she
going
to
leave
me
thus
she
spurred
towards
the
centre
of
the
glade
where
the
ground
was
higher
and
there
again
pulled
up
come
hither
cavallero
she
cried
beckoning
to
me
with
her
small
gloved
hand
mechanically
i
moved
forward
to
the
spot
so
gallant
capitan
you
who
are
brave
enough
to
meet
a
score
of
foes
have
not
the
courage
to
ask
a
woman
if
she
loves
you
a
dismal
smile
was
my
only
reply
to
this
bitter
badinage
ah
capitan
she
continued
i
will
not
believe
it
ere
now
you
have
put
that
dreaded
interrogatory
often
i
fear
too
often
i
looked
at
her
with
surprise
there
was
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
tone
the
gay
smile
was
gone
her
eyelids
drooped
her
look
was
turned
upon
the
ground
was
this
real
or
only
a
seeming
the
prelude
to
some
abrupt
antithesis
some
fresh
outburst
of
satire
senorita
said
i
the
hypothesis
whether
true
or
false
can
have
but
little
interest
for
you
she
answered
me
with
a
smile
of
strange
intelligence
i
fancied
there
was
sadness
in
it
i
fancied
we
can
not
recover
the
past
said
she
interrupting
my
thoughts
no
no
no
but
for
the
present
say
again
tell
me
again
that
you
love
me
love
you
yes
lady
and
i
have
your
heart
your
whole
heart
never
can
i
love
another
thanks
thanks
no
more
than
thanks
isolina
for
some
moments
she
remained
silent
her
eyes
averted
from
me
she
appeared
struggling
with
some
emotion
yes
more
than
thanks
she
replied
at
length
gratitude
three
things
more
if
they
will
suffice
to
prove
my
gratitude
name
them
why
should
prudery
tie
my
tongue
i
promised
to
be
candid
i
too
came
here
to
make
confession
listen
three
things
i
have
said
look
around
you
north
south
east
and
west
the
land
you
see
is
mine
be
it
yours
if
you
will
isolina
this
too
can
i
bestow
she
held
forth
her
little
hand
which
i
clasped
with
fervid
emotion
more
more
the
third
the
third
on
second
thoughts
i
can
not
give
is
yours
already
it
is
my
heart
those
splendid
steeds
like
creatures
of
intelligence
appeared
to
understand
what
was
said
they
had
gradually
moved
closer
and
closer
till
their
muzzles
touched
and
their
steel
curbs
rang
together
at
the
last
words
they
came
side
by
side
as
if
yoked
in
a
chariot
it
appeared
delight
to
them
to
press
their
proud
heaving
flanks
against
each
other
while
their
riders
closing
in
mutual
clasp
leaned
over
and
met
their
lips
in
that
wild
fervid
kiss
the
climax
of
love
chapter
forty
seven
strayed
from
the
track
we
parted
upon
the
top
of
the
hill
it
was
not
prudent
for
us
to
be
seen
riding
together
and
isolina
went
away
first
leaving
me
in
the
glade
we
had
bidden
adieu
in
that
phrase
of
pleasant
promise
la
until
we
should
meet
again
and
we
should
visit
that
sweet
spot
repeat
our
burning
words
renew
our
blissful
vows
i
remained
some
minutes
on
the
ground
now
hallowed
and
holy
within
the
tumult
of
triumphant
passion
had
passed
and
was
succeeded
by
the
calm
repose
of
perfect
contentment
my
heart
longings
had
been
gratified
it
had
found
all
that
it
desired
even
to
the
full
reciprocity
of
its
passion
what
would
it
more
there
is
no
more
of
mundane
bliss
life
has
no
felicity
to
cope
with
requited
love
it
alone
can
give
us
a
foretaste
of
future
joys
by
it
only
may
we
form
some
idea
of
the
angel
existence
of
heaven
the
world
without
was
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
within
the
scene
around
me
was
the
flowers
appeared
fresher
in
tint
and
breathed
a
sweeter
fragrance
in
the
air
the
hum
of
the
homeward
bee
laden
with
treasures
for
his
fell
with
a
dreamy
pleasance
upon
the
ear
the
voices
of
the
birds
sounded
softer
and
more
musical
even
the
and
paroquets
chanting
in
a
more
subdued
tone
no
longer
pronounced
that
hated
name
and
the
tiny
mexican
doves
scarcely
so
large
as
finches
walked
with
proud
gait
over
the
ground
or
side
by
side
upon
the
branches
of
the
myrtles
like
types
of
tender
love
told
their
heart
tale
in
soft
and
amorous
cooing
long
could
i
have
lingered
by
that
consecrated
spot
even
la
but
duty
claimed
me
and
its
calls
must
not
be
disregarded
already
the
setting
sun
was
flinging
purple
beams
over
the
distant
prairie
and
heading
my
horse
down
the
hill
i
once
more
plunged
under
the
shadows
of
the
mimosas
absorbed
in
my
supreme
happiness
i
took
no
heed
of
aught
else
i
noticed
neither
track
nor
path
had
i
left
my
horse
to
himself
most
likely
he
would
have
taken
the
right
road
but
in
my
reverie
perhaps
i
had
mechanically
dragged
upon
the
rein
and
turned
him
from
it
whether
or
not
after
a
lapse
of
time
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
thick
woods
with
not
the
semblance
of
a
trail
to
guide
me
and
i
knew
not
whether
i
was
riding
in
the
right
direction
i
ought
rather
to
say
that
i
knew
the
contrary
else
i
must
long
before
have
reached
the
clearings
around
the
village
without
much
reflection
i
turned
in
a
new
direction
and
rode
for
some
time
without
striking
a
trail
this
led
me
once
more
into
doubt
and
i
made
head
back
again
but
still
without
success
i
was
in
a
but
i
could
find
no
path
leading
anywhere
and
amid
the
underwood
of
palmettoes
i
could
not
see
any
great
distance
around
me
beyond
a
question
i
had
strayed
far
out
of
my
way
at
an
early
hour
of
the
day
this
would
have
given
me
little
concern
but
the
sun
had
now
set
and
already
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
it
was
nearly
dark
night
would
be
down
in
a
few
minutes
and
in
all
probability
i
should
be
obliged
to
spend
it
in
the
forest
by
no
means
an
agreeable
prospect
and
the
less
so
that
i
was
thinly
clad
and
hungry
true
i
might
pass
some
hours
in
sweet
reflection
upon
the
pleasant
incident
of
the
day
i
might
dream
rosy
dreams
but
alas
the
soul
is
sadly
under
the
influence
of
the
body
the
spiritual
must
ever
yield
to
the
physical
and
even
love
itself
becomes
a
victim
to
the
vulgar
appetite
of
hunger
i
began
to
fear
that
after
all
i
should
have
but
a
sorry
night
of
it
i
should
be
too
hungry
to
think
too
cold
either
to
sleep
or
dream
besides
i
was
likely
to
get
wet
to
the
shirt
as
the
rain
had
commenced
falling
in
large
heavy
drops
after
another
unsuccessful
effort
to
strike
a
trail
i
pulled
up
and
sat
listening
my
eyes
would
no
longer
avail
me
perhaps
my
ears
might
do
better
service
and
so
it
chanced
the
report
of
a
rifle
reached
them
apparently
fired
some
hundred
yards
off
in
the
woods
considering
that
i
was
upon
hostile
ground
such
a
sound
might
have
caused
me
alarm
but
i
knew
from
the
sharp
crack
that
the
piece
was
a
hunter
rifle
and
no
mexican
ever
handled
a
gun
of
that
kind
moreover
i
had
heard
closely
following
upon
the
shot
a
dull
concussion
as
of
some
heavy
body
dropped
from
a
high
elevation
to
the
ground
i
was
hunter
enough
to
know
the
signification
of
this
sound
it
was
the
game
bird
or
beast
that
had
fallen
from
a
tree
an
american
must
have
fired
that
shot
but
who
there
were
only
three
or
four
of
the
rangers
who
carried
the
a
very
different
weapon
from
the
regulation
piece
old
backwoodsmen
who
had
been
indulged
in
their
whim
it
might
be
one
of
these
without
hesitation
i
headed
my
horse
for
the
spot
and
rode
as
rapidly
as
the
underwood
would
permit
me
i
kept
on
for
five
minutes
or
more
without
halting
i
certainly
must
have
passed
the
place
where
the
shot
had
been
fired
and
yet
i
saw
no
one
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
pull
up
again
a
voice
reached
me
from
behind
with
the
words
by
the
jumpin
geehosophat
it
ur
the
young
fellur
the
turning
i
beheld
my
trapper
comrades
just
emerging
from
the
bushes
where
they
had
cautiously
themselves
on
hearing
the
of
my
horse
and
lain
hid
till
i
had
passed
them
rube
carried
upon
his
shoulders
a
large
turkey
gobbler
the
game
i
had
heard
drop
while
upon
garey
back
i
observed
the
choice
portions
of
a
deer
you
have
been
foraging
to
some
advantage
i
remarked
as
they
came
up
yes
replied
garey
wo
want
for
rashuns
not
but
that
your
rangers
offered
us
a
plenty
to
eat
but
ye
see
we
could
in
honour
accept
o
it
for
we
promised
to
find
for
ourselves
durn
it
added
rube
we
free
mountainee
men
ai
a
gwine
to
sponge
on
nobody
we
ai
an
continued
garey

do
appear
to
be
any
great

about
the
place
for

if
yu
just

turkey
and
one
o
these
hyar
quarters
o
the
plenty
left
for
rube
an
me
ai
thar
rube
gobs
was
the
laconic
answer
i
was
not
loath
to
satisfy
the
wish
of
the
hunters
for
to
say
the
truth
the
village
larder
had
no
such
delicacies
as
either
wild
turkey
or
venison
and
having
signified
my
assent
we
all
three
moved
away
from
the
spot
with
the
trappers
for
my
guides
i
should
soon
get
into
the
right
road
they
too
were
on
their
return
to
the
post
they
had
been
in
the
woods
since
noon
they
were
both
afoot
having
left
their
horses
at
the
rancheria
after
winding
about
among
the
trees
we
came
out
upon
a
narrow
road
here
my
companions
who
were
unacquainted
with
the
neighbourhood
were
at
fault
as
well
as
myself
and
knew
not
which
direction
to
take
it
was
dark
as
pitch
but
as
on
the
night
before
there
was
lightning
at
intervals
unlike
the
preceding
night
however
it
was
now
raining
as
if
all
the
sluices
of
the
sky
had
been
set
open
and
by
this
time
we
were
all
three
of
us
soaking
wet
the
whole
canopy
of
heaven
was
shrouded
in
black
without
a
single
streak
of
light
upon
it
not
even
a
star
who
could
discover
the
direction
in
such
a
night
as
the
lightning
flashed
i
saw
rube
bending
down
over
the
road
he
appeared
to
be
examining
the
tracks
i
noticed
that
there
were
deep
ruts
evidently
made
by
the
rude
of
a
it
was
these
that
the
trapper
was
scanning
almost
as
soon
as
a
man
could
have
read
the
direction
from
a
rube
raised
himself
erect
and
crying
out
all
right
set
off
along
the
road
i
was
curious
to
know
how
he
had
determined
the
point
and
questioned
him
wal
yur
see
young
fellur
it
ur
the
trail
o
a
mexikin
cart
anybody
as
iver
seed
thet
ur
vamint
knows
it
hez
got
only
two
wheels
but
thur
are
four
tracks
hyur
an
thurfor
the
cart
must
a
gone
back
for
i
seed
they
wur
the
same
set
o
wheels
now
raizonable
to
thet
the
leads
to
the
settlements
an
thisaway
but
how
could
you
tell
which
was
the
wagh
thet
ur
easy
as
fallin
off
a
log
the
back
track
ur
the
fresher
by
a
kupple
o
hours
pondering
upon
the
singular
instinct
that
enabled
our
guide
to
distinguish
the
tracks
i
rode
on
in
silence
shortly
after
i
again
heard
the
voice
of
rube
who
was
some
paces
in
the
advance
i
kud
a
knowd
the
way
he
said
the
they
only
made
things
more
sartint
sure
how
i
asked
what
other
clue
had
you
the
water
replied
he
see
or
mout
ef
you
a
looked
into
the
tracks
thet
it
ur
runnin
do
ee
hear
thet
thur
i
listened
i
heard
distinctly
the
sound
of
running
water
as
of
a
small
stream
carried
down
a
rough
rocky
channel
yes
i
hear
it
but
how
should
the
water
guide
you
wal
continued
the
trapper
it
ur
a
branch
made
by
the
rain
we
a
follerin
it
down
an
thurfor
must
kum
to
the
river
jest
whur
we
want
to
git
oncest
thur
we
soon
find
our
way
i
wagh
how
the
durned
rain
kums
down
it
drown
a
wagh
the
result
proved
the
trapper
reasoning
correct
the
was
running
in
the
direction
we
had
taken
and
shortly
after
the
brawling
branch
shot
out
from
among
the
bushes
and
crossed
our
path
diverging
from
it
at
an
acute
angle
we
could
see
however
as
we
plunged
through
the
now
swollen
streamlet
that
the
current
in
its
general
direction
was
the
same
with
our
road
it
would
certainly
guide
us
to
the
river
it
did
so
half
a
mile
farther
on
we
came
out
upon
its
banks
and
struck
the
main
road
leading
to
the
rancheria
a
few
minutes
brisk
travelling
carried
us
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
we
expected
soon
to
be
under
shelter
when
we
were
all
three
brought
to
a
sudden
halt
by
the
sharp
hail
of
the
sentry
who
called
out
the
usual
interrogatory
who
goes
there
friends
i
replied
is
you
quackenboss
i
had
recognised
the
voice
of
the
and
under
the
lightning
saw
him
standing
by
the
trunk
of
a
tree
halt
give
the
countersign
was
the
response
in
a
firm
determined
tone
i
did
not
know
this
masonic
on
riding
out
i
had
not
thought
of
such
a
thing
and
i
began
to
anticipate
some
trouble
i
resolved
however
to
make
trial
of
the
sentry
we
have
got
the
countersign
is
i
quackenboss
i
am
i
announced
my
name
and
rank
do
care
for
all
that
was
the
somewhat
surly
rejoinder
ca
pass
the
countersign
yer
durned
fool
it
yur
captin
cried
rube
in
a
peevish
tone
maybe
replied
the
imperturbable
sentry
ca
let
him
pass
countersign
i
now
saw
that
we
were
in
a
real
dilemma
send
for
the
corporal
of
the
guard
or
either
of
the
lieutenants
i
suggested
thinking
that
that
might
be
the
shortest
way
to
get
over
the
difficulty
hai
got
nobody
to
send
came
the
gruff
voice
of
quackenboss
from
out
the
darkness
i
go
promptly
answered
garey
the
big
trapper
thinking
in
his
innocence
there
could
be
no
reason
why
should
not
carry
the
message
to
quarters
and
as
he
spoke
he
made
a
step
or
two
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
sentinel
halt
there
thundered
the
voice
of
quackenboss
halt
another
step
and
i
plug
you
with
a
bullet
what
thet
plug
he
sez
screamed
rube
leaping
to
the
front
geezus
geehosophat
yu
plug
eh
yur
durned
mulehead
if
shoot
this
way
it
be
the
last
time
yu
ever
lay
claw
to
a
trigger
now
then
and
rube
stood
with
his
rifle
half
raised
to
the
level
and
threatening
to
raise
it
still
higher
at
that
moment
the
lightning
gleamed
i
saw
the
sentry
with
piece
also
at
a
level
i
well
knew
the
accuracy
of
his
aim
i
trembled
for
the
result
in
my
loudest
voice
i
called
out
hold
quackenboss
hold
your
fire
we
shall
wait
till
some
one
comes
and
as
i
spoke
i
caught
both
my
companions
and
drew
them
back
whether
it
was
the
commanding
tone
of
my
voice
which
the
ranger
had
heard
before
or
whether
in
the
light
he
had
recognised
my
features
i
saw
him
before
it
darkened
lower
his
piece
and
i
felt
easy
again
but
he
still
obstinately
refused
to
let
us
pass
further
parley
was
to
no
purpose
and
only
led
to
an
exchange
of
rather
rough
compliments
between
quackenboss
and
my
two
companions
so
after
endeavouring
to
make
peace
between
them
i
stood
still
to
await
the
chance
of
some
one
of
the
guard
coming
within
hail
fortunately
at
that
moment
a
ranger
somewhat
the
worse
for
aguardiente
appeared
in
the
direction
of
the
piazza
quackenboss
condescended
to
call
him
up
and
after
a
crooked
palaver
he
was
despatched
to
bring
the
corporal
of
the
guard
the
arrival
of
the
latter
ended
our
troubles
and
we
were
permitted
to
reach
the
piazza
without
further
hindrance
but
as
we
passed
the
stern
sentry
i
could
hear
rube
mutter
to
him
ee
durned
mulehead
ef
i
hed
ye
out
upon
the
parairas
wud
i
wagh
chapter
forty
eight
an
adios
and
and
a
of
love
whose
every
hour
was
consecrated
to
its
god
at
earliest
dawn
by
the
rosy
rays
of
aurora
at
golden
noon
shadowed
under
sweet
acacias
in
the
gleam
of
the
purple
twilight
the
silvery
light
of
the
moon
that
both
laid
our
hearts
upon
his
altar
and
willing
knelt
before
the
shrine
witness
ye
bright
birds
and
perfumed
flowers
ye
green
myrtles
and
mimosas
witness
ye
blue
skies
of
anahuac
ye
alone
were
our
witnesses
for
you
who
have
loved
i
need
not
portray
the
pleasure
of
this
noble
passion
for
you
who
have
not
loved
i
can
not
love
is
a
delight
that
may
be
known
only
to
those
who
have
experienced
it
ours
was
a
of
happiness
without
alloy
true
there
were
moments
of
pain
the
moments
of
daily
parting
but
these
were
brief
and
perhaps
only
prevented
the
cloyment
of
too
much
joy
if
such
a
thing
be
possible
moreover
these
sorrows
were
in
part
neutralised
by
the
knowledge
we
should
soon
meet
again
we
never
parted
without
exchanging
that
fair
promise
in
the
morning
it
was
la
at
night
our
last
words
were
por
la
lovers
have
felt
and
poets
have
sung
the
pleasures
of
hope
oft
the
anticipation
of
a
pleasure
rivals
in
piquancy
its
actual
enjoyment
let
memory
not
be
forgotten
it
too
has
its
joys
and
oh
how
sweet
the
retrospect
of
those
blissful
hours
if
there
was
monotony
it
was
a
monotone
of
which
my
heart
could
never
tire
it
was
an
intoxication
i
could
have
endured
for
life
there
is
no
surfeit
of
such
sweets
why
are
we
not
permitted
to
enjoy
them
for
ever
alas
there
is
an
ending
there
was
so
a
crisis
came
and
we
must
part
not
with
the
pretty
promise
upon
our
lips
until
the
morning
until
the
evening
but
for
long
weeks
months
maybe
years
an
uncertain
time
se
acabo
la
until
the
war
is
over
oh
the
misery
of
that
parting
cruel
destiny
of
war
never
felt
i
so
weary
of
wearing
a
sword
there
was
a
struggle
love
and
duty
no
not
duty
i
might
have
sheathed
my
sword
and
wronged
no
one
i
was
but
a
cipher
among
thousands
whose
blade
would
scarcely
have
been
missed
nor
would
i
have
wronged
myself
i
was
simply
as
i
have
already
declared
an
adventurer
the
country
for
which
i
fought
could
not
claim
me
i
was
bound
by
no
political
conscience
no
patriotic
perhaps
now
and
then
i
entertained
the
idea
that
i
was
aiding
the
designs
of
manifest
destiny
that
i
was
doing
god
work
in
battling
against
the
despotic
form
yes
i
may
confess
that
such
sparks
glowed
within
me
at
intervals
and
at
such
intervals
only
did
i
feel
enthusiasm
in
the
cause
but
it
was
no
consideration
of
this
kind
that
hindered
me
from
deserting
my
banner
far
otherwise
i
was
influenced
by
a
motive
purely
selfish
pride
i
could
not
an
adventurer
almost
penniless
i
not
presume
to
claim
that
richly
dowried
hand
fortune
i
might
never
have
to
equal
hers
but
fame
is
worthy
wealth
and
glory
mates
with
beauty
i
knew
that
i
was
gifted
with
an
apt
head
and
bold
aspiring
heart
i
knew
that
i
carried
a
keen
blade
and
hoped
to
hew
my
way
to
rank
and
fame
perhaps
i
might
return
with
a
star
upon
my
shoulder
and
a
better
handle
to
my
name
and
then
ah
for
all
that
it
was
a
bitter
parting
it
was
hard
to
list
unheeding
to
those
earnest
entreaties
adjuring
me
to
stay
terrible
to
entwine
those
tender
arms
terrible
to
utter
that
last
our
troth
was
plighted
within
that
same
glade
that
had
echoed
our
first
vows
it
had
been
plighted
a
hundred
times
but
never
sadly
as
now
amidst
sobs
and
tears
when
the
bright
form
screened
by
the
frondage
had
passed
out
of
sight
i
felt
as
if
the
sun
had
become
suddenly
eclipsed
i
lingered
not
long
though
i
could
have
stayed
for
hours
upon
the
hallowed
spot
again
duty
that
stern
commander
summoned
me
away
it
was
already
close
upon
sunset
and
by
dawn
i
must
be
with
my
troop
i
was
about
heading
my
horse
into
the
track
now
well
known
to
me
isolina
had
gone
down
the
hill
on
the
opposite
side
by
a
path
that
led
more
directly
to
the
hacienda
from
precaution
this
had
been
our
habitual
mode
of
parting
and
we
also
met
from
opposite
sides
in
the
wild
region
of
the
for
by
this
name
was
the
hill
known
we
never
encountered
a
human
being
there
was
no
habitation
near
and
the
vaqueros
rarely
strayed
that
way
so
that
our
place
of
meeting
remained
a
secret
at
least
we
fancied
so
and
we
acted
without
much
apprehension
and
perhaps
without
sufficient
caution
each
hour
we
had
grown
more
confident
of
security
and
blinded
by
love
had
taken
less
pains
to
conceal
the
fact
of
our
daily
assignation
it
was
only
that
morning
i
had
heard
a
whisper
that
our
affair
was
known
and
that
they
of
the
rancheria
were
not
as
benighted
as
we
supposed
them
wheatley
was
my
informant
conchita
his
the
lieutenant
had
added
some
friendly
advice
cautioning
me
against
the
imprudence
of
going
so
far
from
the
post
unattended
perhaps
i
might
have
treated
his
remonstrance
with
less
neglect
but
as
this
was
to
be
our
last
meeting
for
a
long
time
my
heart
grew
heavy
under
the
prospect
of
the
parting
scene
i
preferred
going
companionless
i
had
no
apprehension
that
any
enemy
was
near
as
for
ijurra
he
was
no
longer
in
the
neighbourhood
he
had
not
been
seen
since
the
night
of
the
battle
and
we
had
positive
information
that
he
had
joined
his
band
with
the
guerrilla
of
the
celebrated
canales
then
operating
on
the
road
between
camargo
and
monterey
indeed
had
ijurra
been
near
he
could
hardly
have
escaped
the
keen
search
of
holingsworth
and
the
rangers
who
night
and
day
had
been
upon
the
scout
in
hopes
of
overhauling
him
i
was
about
turning
into
the
old
track
when
a
yearning
came
over
me
a
desire
to
obtain
one
more
look
at
my
beloved
by
this
time
she
would
have
reached
her
home
i
should
pass
near
the
house
perhaps
i
might
see
her
upon
the
azotea
a
distant
glance
a
wave
of
the
hand
haply
the
sweet
prayer
con
wafted
upon
the
breeze
something
of
the
kind
i
anticipated
my
horse
seemed
to
divine
my
wishes
scarcely
waiting
for
the
guidance
of
the
rein
he
moved
forward
upon
the
path
taken
by
the
steed
of
isolina
i
soon
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
entering
the
heavy
timber
traversed
a
tangled
wood
similar
to
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
cerro
there
was
no
path
but
the
tracks
of
the
white
steed
were
easily
followed
and
guiding
myself
by
them
i
rode
forward
i
had
not
gone
five
hundred
yards
from
the
hill
when
i
heard
voices
through
the
woods
directly
in
front
of
me
and
apparently
at
no
great
distance
years
of
had
imbued
me
with
an
intuitive
caution
that
resembled
instinct
and
as
if
by
mechanical
effort
i
pulled
up
and
listened
a
woman
was
speaking
and
instantly
i
recognised
the
voice
there
was
but
one
that
rang
with
that
rich
metallic
tone
i
might
well
remember
it
for
the
sweet
sad
sounds
of
the
con
had
not
yet
ceased
to
vibrate
in
my
ears
with
whom
was
she
in
converse
whom
had
she
encountered
in
such
a
place
amid
the
wild
woods
she
ceased
speaking
with
ears
keenly
set
i
listened
for
the
rejoinder
naturally
i
expected
it
in
the
voice
of
a
man
but
not
that
man
oh
heavens
it
was
the
voice
of
rafael
ijurra
chapter
forty
nine
threats
yes
the
voice
was
ijurra
i
knew
it
well
while
listening
to
it
by
the
mesa
i
had
noted
its
tones
sufficiently
to
remember
them
round
sonorous
of
true
spanish
accent
and
not
inharmonious
though
at
that
moment
they
grated
harshly
upon
my
ear
an
indescribable
feeling
came
over
me
it
was
not
jealousy
i
was
too
confident
to
be
jealous
and
yet
i
shame
to
confess
i
felt
a
sensation
sadly
akin
to
it
after
those
earnest
oaths
those
tears
and
frenzied
kisses
so
soon
after
oh
shame
upon
me
alas
the
experienced
heart
no
more
enjoys
the
tranquil
continuity
of
faith
its
belief
is
like
a
broken
dream
an
intermittence
of
light
and
shade
it
was
my
misfortune
my
error
perhaps
my
crime
to
remember
too
many
pairs
of
pretty
perjured
lips
in
a
word
i
was
once
more
jealous
in
spite
of
all
that
had
passed
of
sighs
and
tears
and
plighted
vows
once
more
jealous
of
ijurra
but
the
moment
before
his
name
was
on
her
tongue
and
spoken
with
scorn
in
the
same
breath
i
was
assured
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
neighbourhood
that
he
was
far
away
no
he
was
upon
the
spot
in
close
conversation
with
her
and
scarcely
five
minutes
after
the
oath
had
been
sworn
that
bound
her
to
me
for
life
less
wonder
i
was
jealous
that
the
feeling
lasted
only
for
an
instant
might
be
some
palliation
but
it
was
no
merit
of
mine
that
brought
it
so
quickly
to
a
termination
i
can
not
screen
my
conduct
behind
an
act
of
volition
for
although
the
poisoned
sting
rankled
but
for
a
few
seconds
of
time
during
that
short
period
i
yielded
obedience
to
its
demoniac
promptings
i
slipped
down
gently
from
my
saddle
and
with
the
crouching
gait
and
silent
tread
of
the
jaguar
approached
the
speakers
my
horse
well
trained
to
such
tactics
stayed
where
i
had
dismounted
without
tie
or
hopple
no
fear
that
his
hoof
would
betray
me
step
by
step
i
advanced
with
my
hands
cautiously
parting
the
boughs
the
fronds
of
a
curious
sabal
palm
befriended
me
they
grew
vertically
on
short
petioles
like
large
green
fans
and
overlying
one
another
formed
a
perfect
screen
through
which
the
keenest
eye
could
not
perceive
the
approach
of
an
intruder
in
a
few
seconds
i
stood
behind
the
last
row
that
bounded
the
edge
of
a
small
opening
and
peering
through
the
serrate
interstices
of
the
leaves
i
saw
my
betrothed
and
her
cousin
isolina
was
still
in
the
saddle
ijurra
was
on
foot
and
standing
by
her
stirrup
with
one
hand
resting
upon
the
pommel
the
other
grasping
the
rein
up
to
this
moment
my
heart
had
continued
its
painful
throbbing
but
the
attitude
of
ijurra
with
his
troubled
and
angry
look
at
once
produced
a
revulsion
in
my
feelings
i
saw
that
the
encounter
had
been
accidental
at
least
on
the
part
of
isolina
i
saw
that
she
was
i
could
not
see
her
face
it
was
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
and
towards
ijurra
but
the
tones
of
her
voice
reached
me
and
by
these
i
perceived
that
she
addressed
him
in
anger
oh
how
those
accents
of
indignation
ravished
my
heart
sweeter
were
they
to
me
than
the
softest
melody
as
yet
i
had
heard
nothing
of
what
had
passed
between
them
the
loud
beating
of
my
heart
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
under
my
feet
of
the
boughs
as
i
pressed
through
them
had
prevented
me
from
distinguishing
what
was
said
these
sounds
ceased
as
i
came
to
a
stop
and
although
still
fifty
paces
distant
from
the
speakers
i
could
catch
every
word
of
their
conversation
favoured
by
the
loud
tone
in
which
it
was
carried
on
so
then
you
refuse
it
was
ijurra
who
put
this
interrogatory
i
have
done
so
before
rafael
your
conduct
has
given
me
no
cause
to
change
my
mind
ha
my
conduct
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
have
other
reasons
isolina
do
not
imagine
i
am
such
a
i
know
your
secret
you
love
this
this
yankee
captain
and
suppose
i
do
that
is
my
affair
nay
more
sir
shall
not
even
attempt
to
make
a
secret
of
it
i
do
love
him
i
do
i
do
ijurra
eyes
gleamed
with
malignant
fire
his
lips
turned
white
and
tightened
over
his
teeth
he
seemed
endeavouring
to
curb
the
exposure
of
his
spleen
and
you
would
marry
him
he
asked
with
compressed
emphasis
i
marry
him
was
the
prompt
reply
todos
it
shall
never
be
and
who
is
to
hinder
it
i
ha
ha
ha
you
are
raving
rafael
ijurra
you
may
love
him
to
your
heart
content
i
care
not
but
marry
him
never
never
indeed
by
the
saints
i
swear
it
i
swear
you
have
sworn
enough
you
are
sufficiently
perjured
already
furiously
shouted
ijurra
as
if
losing
patience
listen
to
me
isolina
de
vargas
i
have
something
to
say
that
may
not
be
so
pleasant
you
can
say
nothing
pleasant
but
i
listen
first
then
here
are
certain
documents
that
concern
you
both
you
and
your
father
i
saw
some
folded
papers
in
his
hand
which
he
had
taken
from
under
his
jacket
he
opened
and
held
them
before
her
face
as
he
continued
this
safeguard
is
one
given
by
the
american
to
the
dona
isolina
de
vargas
perhaps
you
have
seen
it
before
and
here
is
a
letter
from
don
ramon
de
vargas
to
the
of
the
american
army
enclosed
within
another
from
that
functionary
to
your
pet
filibustero
a
pretty
piece
of
treason
this
well
sir
not
so
well
for
you
madame
you
forget
that
general
santa
anna
is
now
chief
of
this
republic
think
you
he
will
not
punish
such
traitorous
correspondence
if
i
but
lay
these
documents
before
his
excellency
i
shall
have
an
order
for
the
arrest
of
both
yourself
and
your
father
as
quickly
as
it
can
be
spoken
no
more
the
estate
will
be
proscript
and
confiscated
it
will
become
mine
mine
the
speaker
paused
as
if
for
an
answer
isolina
remained
silent
i
could
not
see
her
face
to
notice
the
effect
i
fancied
that
the
threat
had
terrified
her
ijurra
continued
now
senorita
you
better
comprehend
our
relative
positions
give
your
consent
to
become
my
wife
and
these
papers
shall
be
destroyed
on
the
instant
never
was
the
firm
response
that
delighted
my
ears
never
echoed
ijurra
then
dread
the
consequences
i
shall
obtain
orders
for
your
arrest
and
as
soon
as
this
horde
of
yankee
ruffians
has
been
driven
from
the
country
the
property
shall
be
mine
ha
ha
ha
came
the
scornful
laugh
in
reply
ha
ha
ha
you
mistake
rafael
ijurra
you
are
not
so
as
you
deem
yourself
you
forget
that
my
father
land
lies
on
the
side
of
the
rio
grande
and
ere
that
horde
of
yankee
ruffians
as
you
term
them
be
driven
out
they
will
establish
this
river
for
their
boundary
where
then
will
lie
the
power
of
confiscation
not
with
you
and
your
cowardly
master
ha
ha
ha
the
reply
maddened
ijurra
still
further
for
he
saw
the
probability
of
what
had
been
said
his
face
became
livid
and
he
seemed
to
lose
all
control
of
himself
even
so
he
shouted
with
the
addition
of
a
fierce
oath
even
so
shall
never
inherit
those
lands
listen
isolina
de
vargas
listen
to
another
secret
i
have
for
you
know
senorita
that
you
are
not
the
lawful
daughter
of
don
ramon
i
saw
the
proud
girl
start
as
if
struck
with
an
arrow
i
have
the
proofs
of
what
i
repeat
continued
ijurra
and
even
should
the
united
states
triumph
its
laws
can
not
make
legitimate
you
are
not
the
heiress
of
the
hacienda
de
vargas
as
yet
not
a
word
from
isolina
she
sat
silent
and
motionless
but
i
could
tell
by
the
rising
and
falling
of
her
shoulders
that
a
terrible
storm
was
gathering
in
her
bosom
the
fiend
continued
now
madame
you
may
know
how
disinterested
it
was
of
me
to
offer
you
marriage
nay
more
i
never
loved
you
if
i
told
you
so
it
was
a
lie
he
never
lied
in
his
life
as
he
was
doing
at
that
moment
his
face
bespoke
the
falsehood
of
his
words
it
was
the
utterance
of
purest
spleen
i
read
in
his
look
the
unmistakable
expression
of
jealousy
coarse
as
the
passion
may
have
been
he
loved
her
oh
how
could
it
have
been
otherwise
love
you
indeed
ha
ha
ha
love
you
the
daughter
of
a
poor
indian
a
the
climax
had
come
the
heaving
bosom
could
bear
silence
no
longer
the
insult
was
unendurable
base
wretch
cried
she
in
a
voice
of
compressed
agony
stand
aside
from
my
path
not
yet
answered
ijurra
grasping
the
bridle
more
firmly
i
have
something
further
to
communicate
villain
release
the
rein
before
i
do
you
shall
promise
you
shall
swear
again
let
go
or
this
bullet
to
your
heart
i
had
sprung
from
out
the
thicket
and
was
running
forward
to
her
rescue
i
saw
her
right
hand
raised
on
high
and
something
shining
in
its
grasp
it
was
a
pistol
its
muzzle
was
pointed
at
ijurra
no
doubt
the
resolute
character
of
her
who
held
it
was
well
known
to
him
for
the
threat
produced
an
immediate
effect
the
coward
relaxed
his
hold
the
reins
dropped
from
his
fingers
and
with
a
mingled
look
of
hatred
and
fear
he
stepped
back
a
pace
the
moment
the
bridle
became
free
the
steed
already
startled
by
the
spur
bounded
forward
and
after
springs
both
horse
and
rider
disappeared
behind
the
screen
of
the
palmettoes
i
was
too
late
to
play
the
the
ladye
faire
had
not
needed
my
help
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
me
and
by
the
time
i
arrived
upon
the
ground
she
had
passed
out
of
sight
and
ijurra
was
alone
chapter
fifty
awkward
odds
ijurra
was
alone
and
i
continued
to
advance
to
the
spot
where
he
was
standing
his
back
was
towards
me
for
he
still
fronted
in
the
direction
in
which
isolina
had
galloped
off
he
had
followed
her
with
his
eyes
with
a
cry
of
disappointed
rage
with
a
threat
of
malignant
vengeance
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
hindered
him
from
hearing
mine
and
he
was
not
aware
of
my
presence
when
i
paused
scarcely
three
feet
from
where
he
stood
and
directly
behind
him
i
held
my
sword
drawn
i
could
have
thrust
him
in
the
back
through
and
through
again
before
he
could
have
offered
either
defence
or
resistance
he
was
completely
in
my
power
fortunate
was
it
for
him
at
that
moment
that
i
had
been
bred
a
gentleman
else
in
another
instant
his
lifeless
body
would
have
lain
at
my
feet
a
plebeian
blade
would
have
made
short
work
with
the
ruffian
and
i
confess
that
my
instincts
of
were
sorely
tried
i
had
before
me
a
man
who
had
sought
my
life
a
deadly
foe
a
deadly
foe
to
her
i
loved
a
perjured
villain
a
murderer
with
such
titles
for
himself
he
had
none
to
the
laws
of
honour
and
i
confess
that
for
one
short
moment
i
felt
like
ignoring
his
claim
was
but
for
a
moment
the
thought
revolted
me
wicked
and
worthless
as
he
was
i
could
not
stab
him
in
the
back
i
leaned
forward
and
tapping
him
upon
the
shoulder
pronounced
his
name
it
was
the
first
intimation
he
had
of
my
presence
and
starting
as
if
hit
by
a
bullet
he
turned
face
towards
me
the
flush
of
anger
upon
his
cheek
suddenly
gave
place
to
deadly
pallor
and
his
eyes
became
set
in
that
peculiar
stare
that
indicates
an
apprehension
of
danger
this
he
must
have
felt
keenly
for
my
determined
look
and
drawn
sword
to
say
nothing
of
the
surprise
by
which
i
had
come
upon
him
were
calculated
to
produce
that
effect
it
was
the
first
time
we
had
stood
face
to
face
and
i
now
perceived
that
he
was
a
much
larger
man
than
myself
but
i
saw
too
that
his
eye
quailed
and
his
lip
quivered
at
the
encounter
i
saw
that
he
was
cowed
felt
that
i
was
his
master
you
are
rafael
ijurra
i
repeated
as
he
had
not
made
answer
to
my
first
interrogation
he
answered
hesitatingly
what
want
you
with
me
you
have
some
documents
there
he
still
held
the
papers
in
his
hand
a
portion
of
them
belongs
to
me
i
shall
trouble
you
to
hand
them
over
are
you

he
asked
after
a
pause
at
the
same
time
pretending
to
examine
the
superscription
upon
the
commissary
letter
i
saw
that
his
fingers
trembled
i
am
captain
warfield
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
without
noticing
the
insinuation
he
replied
true
there
is
a
letter
here
bearing
that
address
i
found
it
upon
the
road
you
are
welcome
to
it
senor
as
he
said
this
he
handed
me
the
commissary
order
still
retaining
the
other
documents
there
was
an
enclosure
i
perceive
you
have
it
in
your
hand
i
beg
you
will
make
me
equally
welcome
to
that
oh
a
note
signed
ramon
de
vargas
it
was
an
enclosure
precisely
so
and
of
course
goes
along
with
the
letter
oh
certainly
here
it
is
senor
there
is
still
another
little
document
in
your
possession
a
safeguard
from
the
american
commander
granted
to
a
certain
lady
it
is
not
yours
senor
ijurra
i
beg
you
will
deliver
it
to
me
i
wish
to
return
it
to
the
lady
to
whom
it
belongs
this
was
the
bitterest
pill
i
had
yet
presented
to
him
he
glanced
hastily
first
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
as
if
desirous
of
making
escape
he
would
fain
have
done
so
but
i
kept
him
under
my
eye
and
he
saw
that
my
hand
was
ready
certainly
there
is
a
safeguard
replied
he
after
a
pause
and
with
a
feigned
attempt
at
laughter
is
a
worthless
document
to
me
is
at
your
service
sir
captain
and
as
he
handed
me
the
paper
he
accompanied
the
act
with
another
sorry
cachinnation
i
folded
the
precious
documents
and
thrust
all
three
under
the
breast
of
my
coat
then
placing
myself
in
fighting
attitude
i
cried
out
to
my
adversary
to
draw
and
defend
himself
i
had
already
noticed
that
he
wore
a
sword
and
like
myself
it
appeared
to
be
the
only
weapon
he
carried
i
saw
no
pistols
upon
his
person
i
had
none
myself
nothing
save
a
light
sword
it
was
far
slighter
than
the
sabre
of
my
antagonist
but
it
was
a
weapon
that
had
seen
service
in
my
hands
and
i
had
perfect
confidence
in
it
i
had
no
fear
for
the
result
against
so
cowardly
an
adversary
i
was
not
awed
either
by
his
heavier
blade
or
the
superior
size
of
his
person
to
my
astonishment
he
hesitated
to
unsheath
his
sword
you
draw
i
shouted
with
emphasis
you
or
i
have
now
to
die
if
you
do
not
defend
yourself
i
shall
run
you
through
the
body
coward
would
you
have
me
kill
you
with
your
blade
in
its
sheath
even
the
taunt
did
not
nerve
him
never
saw
i
complete
a
poltroon
his
white
lips
trembled
his
eyes
rolled
wildly
from
side
to
side
seeking
an
opportunity
to
escape
i
am
certain
that
could
he
have
hoped
to
get
clear
he
would
at
that
crisis
have
turned
and
run
all
at
once
and
to
my
surprise
the
coward
appeared
smitten
with
courage
and
grasping
the
hilt
of
his
sabre
he
drew
the
blade
ringing
from
its
scabbard
with
all
the
energy
of
a
determined
man
his
reluctance
to
fight
seemed
suddenly
to
have
forsaken
him
had
i
mistaken
my
man
or
was
it
despair
that
was
nerving
his
arm
his
cowed
look
had
disappeared
his
eyes
flashed
with
fury
and
vengeance
his
teeth
gritted
together
and
a
fierce
hissed
from
his
lips
our
blades
met
the
sparks
crackled
along
the
creasing
steel
and
the
combat
began
fortunate
for
me
that
in
avoiding
the
first
lunge
of
my
antagonist
i
had
to
turn
half
round
fortunately
i
turned
so
soon
else
i
should
never
have
left
that
glade
alive
as
i
faced
in
the
new
direction
i
saw
two
men
running
towards
us
sword
in
hand
a
single
glance
told
me
they
were
guerrilleros
they
were
already
within
ten
paces
of
the
spot
and
must
have
been
seen
long
before
by
ijurra
this
was
the
key
to
his
altered
demeanour
their
approach
it
was
that
had
inspired
him
with
courage
to
begin
the
fight
for
he
had
calculated
the
time
when
they
should
be
able
to
get
up
and
assail
me
from
behind
shouted
he
seeing
that
i
had
discovered
them
el
anda
anda
mueran
los
yankies
at
muerte
con
el
for
the
first
time
i
felt
myself
in
danger
three
swords
to
one
was
awkward
odds
and
the
red
giant
with
a
companion
nearly
as
large
as
himself
would
no
doubt
prove
very
different
antagonists
from
the
poltroon
with
whom
i
was
engaged
yes
i
was
conscious
of
danger
and
might
have
retreated
had
i
deemed
such
a
course
possible
but
my
horse
was
too
far
off
and
the
were
directly
in
the
path
i
should
have
to
take
to
reach
him
i
could
not
hope
to
escape
on
foot
i
well
knew
that
these
men
run
as
lightly
as
indians
for
we
had
often
proved
their
capacity
in
that
accomplishment
they
were
already
near
i
should
be
overtaken
struck
down
pierced
with
my
back
to
the
foe
i
had
no
time
to
reflect
just
enough
to
leap
back
a
pace
or
two
so
as
to
bring
all
three
of
them
in
front
of
me
when
i
found
my
sword
clashing
against
their
blades
and
parrying
their
blows
one
after
the
other
i
can
describe
the
unequal
combat
no
farther
it
was
a
confused
medley
of
cut
and
thrust
in
which
i
both
gave
wounds
and
received
them
i
was
wounded
in
several
places
and
felt
the
warm
blood
running
under
my
clothes
and
over
my
face
i
grew
wearied
to
death
and
every
second
growing
weaker
and
fainter
i
saw
the
red
giant
before
me
with
his
hand
raised
on
high
his
blade
had
already
drawn
my
blood
and
was
crimsoned
at
the
point
it
was
about
to
descend
with
a
finishing
stroke
i
should
be
unable
to
parry
it
for
i
had
just
exhausted
my
strength
in
guarding
against
a
blow
from
ijurra
my
hopeless
peril
wrung
from
me
a
cry
of
despair
was
it
my
cry
that
caused
the
blade
to
drop
from
the
hand
of
my
antagonist
and
the
uplifted
arm
to
fall
loosely
by
his
side
was
it
my
cry
that
created
the
consternation
suddenly
visible
in
the
faces
of
my
foes
i
might
have
fancied
so
had
i
not
heard
a
sharp
crack
from
behind
and
seen
that
the
arm
of
el
zorro
was
broken
by
a
shot
it
seemed
like
the
awaking
from
some
horrid
dream
one
moment
i
was
battling
face
to
face
with
three
desperate
men
the
instant
after
their
backs
were
towards
me
and
all
three
were
running
as
for
life
i
followed
them
with
my
eyes
but
not
far
for
at
twenty
paces
off
they
plunged
into
the
thicket
and
disappeared
i
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
a
man
was
running
across
the
open
ground
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
he
was
advancing
towards
the
spot
where
i
stood
it
was
he
who
had
fired
the
shot
i
saw
that
he
was
in
mexican
costume
surely
he
was
one
of
the
guerrilleros
he
had
aimed
at
me
and
wounded
his
comrade
for
some
seconds
i
fancied
that
such
might
be
the
case
evidently
he
was
bolder
than
any
of
the
three
for
he
continued
to
advance
as
if
determined
to
attack
me
alone
i
placed
myself
in
readiness
for
this
new
antagonist
taking
a
fresh
grasp
on
my
sword
and
wiping
the
blood
from
my
eyes
that
i
might
the
better
receive
him
it
was
not
until
he
was
close
to
the
point
of
my
blade
that
i
recognised
the
long
arms
and
crooked
mateless
limbs
of
elijah
quackenboss
the
ranger
after
delivering
his
fire
had
not
waited
to
reload
but
ran
forward
with
the
intention
of
joining
me
in
the
fight
though
he
carried
no
other
weapon
than
his
empty
gun
but
this
would
have
been
an
efficient
arm
in
such
hands
for
despite
his
unsymmetrical
build
dutch
lige
was
stalwart
and
though
and
would
have
been
a
full
match
for
any
two
of
my
assailants
had
they
stood
their
ground
but
the
crack
of
the
gun
had
set
them
off
like
deer
they
fancied
no
doubt
that
a
stronger
force
was
near
perhaps
they
remembered
the
terrible
rifles
of
the
trappers
and
no
doubt
believed
it
was
they
who
had
arrived
to
the
rescue
indeed
such
was
my
own
belief
until
i
saw
the
ranger
bounding
towards
the
spot
a
glance
satisfied
me
that
i
owed
my
preservation
to
lige
love
of
botanical
science
a
large
cactus
plant
bristling
like
a
hedgehog
hung
dangling
from
the
swivel
of
his
gun
it
was
thus
carried
to
save
his
fingers
from
contact
with
its
barbed
spines
while
stuck
into
every
loop
and
of
his
dress
could
be
seen
the
leaves
and
branchlets
and
fruits
and
flowers
of
a
host
of
curious
and
unknown
plants
he
had
been
herborising
in
the
woods
and
coming
by
chance
within
earshot
of
the
scuffle
had
scrambled
through
the
bushes
just
in
time
to
spoil
the
intended
by
el
zorro
thanks
quackenboss
thanks
my
brave
friend
you
came
in
good
time
you
have
saved
me
but
a
poor
shot
i
made
capten
i
ought
to
have
broken
that
red
divel
skull
or
sent
my
bullet
into
his
stomach
he
got
off
too
easy
it
was
a
good
shot
you
broke
his
arm
i
think
ach
was
a
poor
shot
the
cactus
spoiled
my
aim
you
hurt
capten
i
am
wounded
but
not
mortally
i
think
i
feel
a
little
faint
is
only
the
blood
my
horse
you
will
find
him
yonder
among
the
trees
yonder
go
lige
bring
my
horse
my
horse
for
some
minutes
i
was
out
of
the
world
when
consciousness
came
back
i
perceived
that
my
steed
had
been
brought
up
and
stood
near
the
botanist
was
bending
over
me
and
binding
up
my
wounds
with
strips
torn
from
his
own
shirt
he
had
one
boot
on
the
other
stood
by
full
of
water
a
portion
of
which
he
had
already
poured
down
my
throat
and
with
the
rest
he
proceeded
to
bathe
my
temples
and
wash
the
blood
from
my
face
this
done
i
soon
felt
refreshed
and
strong
enough
to
mount
and
having
climbed
into
the
saddle
i
set
out
for
the
rancheria
my
companion
half
guiding
half
leadin
my
horse
by
the
path
which
we
followed
we
should
have
to
pass
close
to
the
hacienda
and
within
sight
of
it
but
night
had
come
on
and
the
darkness
would
hinder
us
from
being
observed
it
was
what
i
now
desired
though
i
had
left
the
cerro
with
hopes
and
wishes
directly
the
reverse
with
a
red
gash
upon
my
forehead
my
uniform
torn
and
i
feared
being
seen
lest
my
invalid
appearance
should
create
unnecessary
alarm
but
we
passed
on
without
meeting
any
one
either
by
the
hill
or
upon
the
main
road
and
in
after
i
was
safe
within
my
in
the
house
of
the
alcalde
chapter
fifty
one
an
official
black
list
the
incidents
of
the
day
preyed
upon
my
spirits
and
i
was
far
from
feeling
easy
about
the
future
i
knew
that
my
betrothed
would
be
true
till
death
and
i
felt
ashamed
that
i
had
doubted
her
even
for
a
moment
about
her
loyalty
i
had
no
uneasiness
and
i
mentally
vowed
never
more
to
give
way
to
suspicion
it
was
no
thought
of
that
that
now
troubled
me
but
an
anxiety
about
personal
and
this
grew
stronger
the
more
i
pondered
upon
it
till
it
assumed
almost
the
form
of
a
fear
the
man
who
had
used
such
bitter
threats
and
behaved
with
so
much
rudeness
would
scarcely
stop
at
anything
is
true
i
had
deprived
him
of
much
of
his
power
over
her
by
stripping
him
of
the
dangerous
documents
but
it
was
not
this
time
nor
was
he
the
man
to
stand
upon
nice
distinctions
of
legality
where
jealousy
and
cupidity
were
the
incentives
to
action
holding
a
sort
of
irresponsible
office
as
the
chief
of
what
was
less
a
patriotic
guerrilla
than
a
band
of
brigands
it
was
difficult
to
tell
what
such
a
monster
might
or
might
not
attempt
in
our
absence
from
the
post
the
ruffian
would
be
full
master
of
the
neighbourhood
what
deed
might
he
not
accomplish
with
impunity
holding
his
power
directly
from
the
unprincipled
dictator
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
imitate
as
a
model
and
who
would
indorse
any
act
of
villainy
provided
it
was
the
act
of
one
of
his
own
satellites
i
shuddered
as
i
reflected
the
reappearance
of
ijurra
and
his
band
for
i
doubted
not
that
his
followers
were
near
their
reappearance
in
that
vicinity
and
at
such
a
crisis
just
as
we
were
being
withdrawn
had
something
ominous
in
it
they
must
have
known
ere
this
of
the
plan
of
campaign
designed
for
the
american
army
wheatley
rumour
had
proved
well
founded
the
new
scott
had
arrived
upon
the
ground
and
of
the
army
of
occupation
had
been
draughted
to
form
the
expedition
destined
to
act
upon
vera
cruz
as
this
greedy
general
stripped
our
old
favourite
rough
and
ready
of
his
best
troops
we
had
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
the
rangers
were
among
the
picked
though
for
all
that
many
of
us
would
have
preferred
remaining
with
the
brave
veteran
who
had
already
led
us
so
often
to
victory
i
can
answer
for
wheatley
and
myself
i
might
also
vouch
for
holingsworth
though
far
different
were
his
motives
for
wishing
to
remain
on
the
rio
grande
his
sweetheart
was
revenge
in
his
breast
long
cherished
to
his
heart
faithful
and
true
i
have
said
that
our
design
must
have
been
known
to
the
enemy
ere
this
indeed
our
army
was
already
in
movement
troops
and
brigades
were
marching
upon
brazos
santiago
and
tampico
there
to
be
embarked
for
the
south
and
all
that
were
to
go
had
received
their
orders
the
provinces
on
the
rio
grande
were
not
to
be
entirely
abandoned
but
the
army
left
there
was
to
have
its
lines
contracted
and
would
therefore
cover
much
less
ground
not
only
was
our
little
post
to
be
deserted
but
the
neighbouring
town
which
had
long
been
the
of
a
division
was
also
to
be
evacuated
no
force
of
ours
would
remain
within
fifty
miles
of
the
rancheria
and
perhaps
no
american
troop
would
ever
again
visit
that
isolated
village
the
reflection
rendered
me
more
than
melancholy
no
doubt
of
it
then
the
enemy
was
apprised
of
our
movements
in
our
special
case
that
the
rangers
were
to
march
on
the
following
morning
was
well
known
to
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
it
had
been
known
to
them
for
several
days
and
it
had
not
passed
unobserved
by
us
that
the
citizens
of
the
place
those
who
were
not
ayankieados
had
lately
shown
themselves
more
sulky
and
inhospitable
in
proportion
as
the
time
approached
for
our
departure
this
had
led
to
several
in
which
knives
had
been
drawn
and
blood
spilled
and
much
bad
blood
begotten
on
both
sides
another
circumstance
was
not
unnoticed
amongst
us
ribald
pasquinades
rudely
written
and
accompanied
by
threats
of
proscription
were
at
this
time
thrust
under
the
doors
of
such
of
the
citizens
as
had
been
friendly
to
us
even
the
alcalde
had
received
some
documents
of
this
character
perhaps
emanating
from
a
jealous
who
had
looked
with
bitter
eye
upon
the
courtship
of
wheatley
and
conchita
it
was
not
till
afterwards
i
learned
that
similar
missives
had
come
to
hand
in
a
quarter
that
more
concerned
myself
some
scouted
the
absurdity
of
these
acts
alleging
that
they
sprung
from
personal
enmity
or
originated
in
the
of
the
it
was
not
so
as
we
afterwards
learned
the
government
of
the
country
or
at
all
events
several
of
its
prominent
members
countenanced
the
meanness
and
at
their
instigation
a
black
list
was
made
out
in
every
town
and
village
through
which
the
american
army
had
occasion
to
pass
let
the
minister
senor
o
make
answer
to
this
accusation
i
was
musing
on
this
disagreeable
theme
after
my
return
from
the
cerro
and
endeavouring
to
sketch
out
some
plan
for
the
safety
of
my
betrothed
during
my
absence
but
my
thoughts
proved
barren
with
a
sort
of
faint
hope
that
the
villain
ijurra
might
yet
fall
into
our
hands
i
had
despatched
holingsworth
nothing
loath
for
the
duty
with
a
party
of
rangers
upon
his
trail
and
i
was
impatiently
awaiting
their
return
the
voice
of
wheatley
aroused
me
from
my
reverie
well
lieutenant
what
is
it
only
that
precious
boy
answered
he
with
a
significant
smile
at
the
same
time
ushering
cyprio
into
the
room
the
lad
carried
a
note
which
i
opened
a
green
sprig
of
juniper
was
enclosed
and
the
simple
word
was
written
in
pencil
i
knew
the
symbol
well
the
juniper
is
in
that
most
beautiful
of
tongues
and
from
a
lady
signifies
yours
anything
more
i
asked
of
the
messenger
nothing
senor
capitan
answered
the
intelligent
boy
only
to
inquire
if
you
had
arrived
safe
she
had
been
anxious
then
i
separated
the
branchlet
into
two
equal
parts
one
i
placed
in
my
bosom
the
other
having
fervently
kissed
i
enclosed
in
a
folded
sheet
upon
which
i
wrote
the
words
la
cyprio
bore
back
my
parting
message
at
midnight
holingsworth
and
his
party
came
in
from
the
scout
nothing
had
been
seen
of
the
guerrilla
chapter
fifty
two
the
route
it
was
a
struggle
between
aurora
and
the
moon
which
of
them
should
rule
the
sky
when
our
bugle
rang
its
clear
rousing
the
rangers
from
their
slumber
and
startling
their
steeds
at
the
stall
the
goddess
of
morning
soon
triumphed
and
under
her
soft
blue
light
men
and
horses
could
be
seen
moving
about
until
the
bugle
again
sounded
this
time
to
boot
and
saddle
and
the
rangers
began
to
form
in
the
piazza
and
prepare
for
the
route
a
single
wagon
with
its
white
tilt
and
long
team
of
mules
already
hitched
up
stood
near
the
centre
of
the
square
it
constituted
the
whole
of
the
corps
and
served
as
an
ambulance
for
our
invalids
both
baggage
and
sick
had
been
safely
stowed
and
the
vehicle
was
ready
for
the
road
the
bugler
already
in
his
saddle
awaited
orders
to
sound
the
forward
i
had
climbed
to
my
favourite
the
azotea
perhaps
it
was
the
last
time
i
should
ever
set
foot
on
those
painted
tiles
my
eyes
wandered
over
the
piazza
though
i
little
heeded
what
was
passing
there
only
the
salient
points
of
the
picture
were
noted
by
me
steeds
under
saddle
and
bridle
men
buckling
on
folded
blankets
holsters
and
valises
a
few
already
in
the
saddle
a
few
more
standing
by
the
heads
of
their
horses
and
still
another
few
grouped
round
the
door
of
the
having
a
last
drink
of
or
with
their
swarthy
mexican
acquaintances
here
and
there
in
front
of
some
adobe
hut
might
be
observed
a
more
tender
the
ranger
fully
equipped
with
arms
haversack
and
canteen
leaning
against
the
heavy
bars
of
a
window
his
face
turned
inward
as
though
he
was
talking
to
some
prisoner
through
the
grating
of
a
jail
but
he
is
himself
the
real
captive
ensnared
during
his
short
sojourn
and
still
held
in
chains
by
the
whose
dark
liquid
eyes
may
be
seen
on
the
other
side
of
the
reja
flashing
with
love
or
melting
with
sad
tenderness
at
the
prospect
of
parting
others
again
are
bidding
their
in
retired
corners
under
the
shadow
of
the
church
walls
or
in
groups
of
four
or
five
more
openly
in
the
piazza
itself
early
as
is
the
hour
the
people
have
all
arisen
and
not
a
few
of
the
brown
wenches
are
already
on
their
way
on
crown
to
the
fountain
there
the
pitchers
are
filled
and
lifted
on
their
heads
perhaps
for
the
last
time
by
the
rangers
who
perform
the
office
with
all
the
rude
grace
in
their
power
then
follows
a
profusion
of
smiles
and
bows
and
a
dialogue
on
the
ranger
part
extending
to
the
whole
of
his
spanish
which
consists
of
the
phrase
mucho
bueno
muchacha
the
usual
reply
accompanied
with
a
display
of
pretty
white
teeth
is
mucho
bueno
cavallero
mucho
bueno
tejano
given
in
like
ungrammatical
phrase
in
order
that
it
may
be
intelligible
to
the
person
to
whom
it
is
addressed
i
have
often
been
surprised
at
the
success
of
my
great
uncouth
followers
with
these
damsels
of
anahuac
but
indeed
many
of
the
rangers
are
not
men
on
the
contrary
there
are
handsome
fellows
among
them
if
they
were
only
put
into
clean
shirts
and
a
little
more
closely
shaven
but
woman
eye
is
in
such
matters
she
easily
penetrates
through
the
disguise
of
dust
the
bronze
of
and
the
shaggy
mask
of
an
beard
and
no
eye
is
quicker
in
this
respect
than
that
of
the
fair
mexicana
in
the
big
apparently
rude
individual
called
a
ranger
she
beholds
a
type
of
strength
and
courage
a
heart
that
can
cherish
and
an
arm
that
can
protect
her
these
are
qualities
that
from
all
time
have
won
the
love
of
woman
it
is
evident
they
are
not
all
friends
whom
we
are
leaving
behind
us
hostile
faces
may
be
observed
many
of
them
peering
from
open
doors
or
windows
here
and
there
a
sulky
lepero
swings
about
in
his
blanket
or
cowers
by
the
corner
of
the
street
scowling
savagely
from
under
his
hat
most
of
this
class
are
absent
as
long
since
ascertained
with
the
guerrilla
but
a
few
still
remain
to
give
shadow
to
the
picture
they
regard
the
approaches
towards
their
women
with
anger
and
would
resent
this
politeness
if
they
dared
they
confine
the
exhibition
of
their
spite
to
the
dastardly
meanness
of
the
women
themselves
whenever
they
have
an
opportunity
no
later
than
the
night
before
one
of
them
was
detected
in
beating
his
sweetheart
or
mistress
for
the
crime
as
was
alleged
of
dallying
too
long
in
the
company
of
a
tejano
the
tejano
in
this
case
took
the
law
into
his
own
hands
and
severely
chastised
the
jealous
even
in
the
hurried
glance
which
i
gave
to
these
scenes
of
i
could
not
help
noticing
an
expression
on
the
faces
of
some
of
the
young
girls
that
had
in
it
a
strange
significance
it
was
something
more
than
sadness
it
was
more
like
the
uneasy
look
that
betokens
apprehension
perhaps
the
state
of
mind
i
was
in
magnified
my
perceptions
at
that
moment
a
struggle
was
passing
in
my
own
breast
and
a
feeling
of
irresolution
lay
heavy
upon
me
all
night
long
had
my
mind
dwelt
upon
the
same
thought
the
danger
that
menaced
my
betrothed
all
night
long
i
had
been
occupied
with
plans
to
avert
it
but
no
reasonable
scheme
had
i
succeeded
in
devising
it
is
true
the
danger
was
only
hypothetical
and
undefined
but
it
was
just
this
supposititious
indefiniteness
that
caused
the
difficulty
in
providing
against
it
had
it
assumed
a
tangible
shape
i
might
more
easily
have
adopted
some
means
of
avoiding
it
but
no
it
remained
a
shadow
and
against
a
shadow
i
knew
not
what
precautions
to
take
when
morning
broke
i
was
still
struggling
under
the
same
nervous
indecision
problematical
as
was
the
peril
my
fancy
had
formed
there
were
moments
when
it
appalled
me
moments
when
my
mind
laboured
under
a
painful
presentiment
and
i
could
not
cast
the
load
by
any
act
of
volition
with
all
my
philosophy
i
could
not
fortify
myself
against
the
belief
that
coming
events
cast
their
shadows
before
and
spite
of
myself
i
kept
repeating
in
thought
the
weird
prophetic
words
upon
my
soul
certainly
there
were
shadows
and
dark
ones
if
the
events
should
have
any
correspondence
with
them
then
there
was
misery
before
me
i
have
termed
the
danger
in
which
isolina
was
placed
indefinite
it
was
not
so
indefinite
after
a
fair
analysis
it
was
directly
traceable
to
the
presence
of
rafael
ijurra
true
there
were
other
sources
of
apprehension
other
perils
surrounded
her
arising
from
the
disturbed
state
of
the
country
but
these
did
not
point
at
her
in
particular
that
frontier
province
had
been
for
years
in
a
distracted
condition
by
revolution
or
indian
invasion
and
war
was
no
new
thing
to
its
people
in
the
midst
of
strife
had
this
fair
flower
grown
to
perfect
blooming
without
having
been
either
crushed
or
trodden
upon
isolina
de
vargas
was
a
woman
of
sufficient
spirit
to
resist
insult
and
cast
off
intrusion
i
had
just
had
proof
of
this
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
had
no
fear
that
she
would
be
unequal
to
the
emergency
but
the
circumstances
in
which
she
now
stood
were
not
of
that
character
they
were
extraordinary
and
that
to
an
extreme
degree
in
addition
to
the
light
thrown
upon
ijurra
designs
by
his
own
menacing
confession
i
knew
other
particulars
of
him
holingsworth
had
helped
me
to
a
knowledge
of
this
bad
man
and
this
knowledge
it
was
that
rendered
me
apprehensive
from
a
nature
so
base
and
brutal
it
was
natural
i
should
dread
the
worst
but
what
could
i
do
i
might
have
thrown
up
my
commission
and
remained
upon
the
spot
but
this
would
have
been
worse
than
idle
i
could
not
have
protected
myself
much
less
another
the
rangers
once
gone
from
the
place
my
life
would
not
have
been
safe
there
for
a
single
hour
only
one
plan
suggested
itself
that
had
the
semblance
of
feasibility
to
seek
another
interview
with
isolina
her
father
as
well
and
adjure
them
to
remove
at
once
from
the
scene
of
danger
they
might
proceed
to
san
antonio
de
bexar
where
far
removed
from
hostile
ground
they
could
live
in
safety
till
the
war
should
be
ended
it
was
only
at
the
last
moment
that
this
happy
idea
came
into
my
head
and
i
reviled
myself
that
i
had
not
conceived
it
sooner
the
chief
difficulty
would
lie
in
the
opposition
of
don
ramon
i
knew
that
he
was
aware
of
the
that
existed
between
his
daughter
and
myself
and
furthermore
that
he
had
opposed
no
obstacle
to
it
but
how
could
i
convince
him
of
the
necessity
for
so
sudden
an
expatriation
as
the
one
i
was
about
to
propose
how
should
i
persuade
him
of
the
peril
i
myself
dreaded
and
from
such
a
source
another
difficulty
i
might
encounter
in
the
proud
spirit
of
isolina
herself
much
did
i
fear
she
would
never
consent
to
be
thus
driven
from
her
home
and
by
such
a
poltroon
as
she
knew
her
cousin
to
be
she
had
cowed
and
conquered
him
but
the
day
before
she
feared
him
not
she
would
not
be
likely
to
partake
of
my
painful
apprehensions
my
counsel
might
be
disregarded
my
motives
misconstrued
the
time
too
was
unfavourable
we
must
be
on
the
march
by
sunrise
so
ran
our
orders
and
already
the
day
was
breaking
i
cared
not
much
for
this
i
could
easily
have
overtaken
my
troop
but
it
was
a
delicate
matter
that
could
only
be
excused
by
a
certain
knowledge
of
danger
to
awake
a
gentleman
family
at
such
an
hour
even
for
the
purpose
of
warning
them
moreover
should
my
advice
prove
fruitless
i
reflected
that
my
visit
which
could
not
be
made
in
secret
might
aid
in
bringing
about
the
very
danger
i
apprehended
a
circumstance
so
extraordinary
could
not
fail
to
be
noticed
by
all
it
was
thus
that
i
was
held
in
irresolution
while
my
troop
was
forming
for
the
march
at
the
last
moment
thanks
to
the
thoughtful
holingsworth
a
compromise
offered
he
suggested
that
i
should
send
my
advice
in
writing
in
that
i
could
be
as
explicit
as
i
pleased
and
bring
before
my
proteges
all
the
arguments
i
might
be
able
to
adduce
perhaps
more
successfully
than
if
urged
by
a
personal
appeal
my
comrade
suggestion
was
adopted
and
in
haste
but
with
a
fervour
resulting
from
my
fears
i
penned
the
admonitory
epistle
a
trusty
messenger
was
found
in
one
of
the
who
promised
as
soon
as
the
family
should
be
stirring
to
carry
the
letter
to
its
destination
with
my
heart
somewhat
relieved
of
its
load
though
still
far
from
light
i
gave
the
order
to
march
the
bugle
rang
clear
and
loud
and
its
cheerful
notes
as
i
sprang
into
the
saddle
combined
with
the
inspiration
borrowed
from
my
buoyant
steed
produced
a
soothing
effect
upon
my
spirits
chapter
fifty
three
camp
gossip
it
was
but
a
light
a
passing
gleam
and
soon
again
fell
the
shadow
dark
as
ever
strive
as
i
might
i
could
not
cast
the
load
that
weighed
upon
my
bosom
reason
as
i
would
i
could
not
account
for
its
heaviness
it
was
natural
that
a
parting
like
ours
should
produce
pain
and
misgivings
as
to
the
future
my
life
was
to
be
staked
in
the
lottery
of
war
i
might
fall
on
the
field
of
fight
i
might
perish
by
a
foe
that
in
the
campaign
kills
more
soldiers
than
sword
or
shot
the
many
perils
of
flood
and
field
were
before
me
and
it
was
natural
i
should
regard
the
future
with
a
degree
of
doubtfulness
but
it
was
not
the
contemplation
of
all
these
dangers
that
filled
me
with
such
a
terrible
foreboding
strange
to
say
i
had
a
forecast
that
i
should
survive
them
it
was
almost
a
conviction
yet
it
failed
to
comfort
me
for
it
comprehended
not
the
safety
of
isolina
no
but
the
contrary
along
with
it
came
the
presentiment
that
we
should
never
meet
again
once
or
twice
as
this
dread
feeling
became
most
acute
i
reined
up
my
horse
half
resolved
to
gallop
back
but
again
the
wild
idea
passed
from
me
and
i
continued
irresolutely
on
something
of
prudence
too
now
restrained
me
from
returning
it
would
no
longer
have
been
safe
to
go
back
to
the
rancheria
as
we
issued
from
the
piazza
we
could
hear
distant
jeering
and
cries
of
los
it
was
with
difficulty
i
could
restrain
the
rangers
from
turning
to
take
vengeance
one
the
worse
for
mezcal
had
loitered
behind
under
the
influence
of
the
drink
fancying
himself
secure
him
the
had
bonneted
and
otherwise
maltreated
they
would
have
murdered
him
outright
but
that
some
of
them
more
prudent
than
their
fellows
had
counselled
the
mob
to
let
him
go
alleging
that
the
tejanos
were
yet
too
near
and
might
come
back
again
i
had
strife
with
my
men
they
would
have
returned
and
fired
the
place
had
i
permitted
them
fortunately
he
who
had
been
was
a
fellow
scarcely
worth
the
sympathy
of
his
comrades
and
i
was
well
satisfied
at
his
having
received
a
lesson
it
might
be
useful
and
was
much
needed
for
straggling
was
one
of
the
most
difficult
to
cure
along
the
road
we
saw
signs
of
a
guerrilla
shots
were
fired
at
us
from
a
hill
but
a
party
sent
to
the
place
encountered
no
one
were
observed
and
once
a
brace
of
mounted
men
were
seen
galloping
away
over
a
distant
slope
it
might
be
the
band
of
ijurra
and
doubtless
it
was
so
but
we
fancied
at
the
time
that
canales
himself
was
near
and
as
an
encounter
with
his
large
and
force
would
be
a
very
different
affair
from
a
skirmish
with
the
other
we
felt
the
necessity
of
advancing
with
caution
the
prospect
of
a
fight
with
this
noted
partisan
created
quite
an
excitement
in
the
ranks
to
have
captured
canales
the
chapparal
fox
as
the
texans
termed
him
or
to
have
made
conquest
of
his
band
would
have
been
esteemed
a
feat
of
grand
consequence
only
inferior
in
importance
to
a
pitched
battle
or
the
taking
of
santa
anna
himself
i
confess
that
to
me
the
idea
of
measuring
strength
with
the
famed
guerrillero
was
at
that
moment
rife
with
charms
and
the
excitement
derived
from
the
hope
of
meeting
him
for
a
while
abstracted
my
mind
from
its
painful
bodings
but
we
reached
the
town
without
seeing
aught
of
the
chapparal
fox
it
was
not
likely
that
he
was
on
our
road
or
if
so
he
took
care
not
to
show
himself
canales
fought
not
for
glory
alone
and
the
rangers
were
not
the
foes
he
cared
to
encounter
rich
were
the
game
he
was
used
to
hunt
and
our
solitary
filled
with
sick
soldiers
and
tattered
blankets
half
alive
with
those
charming
little
insects
of
the
genera
and
had
no
attractions
for
the
gallant
guerrillero
on
reaching
the
town
we
were
surprised
to
find
that
the
division
had
not
yet
moved
it
was
to
have
marched
on
that
morning
but
a
countermand
had
arrived
from
delaying
the
movement
for
some
days
perhaps
a
week
this
was
rare
news
to
me
and
as
soon
as
i
heard
it
my
mind
became
occupied
with
projects
and
anticipations
of
a
pleasant
nature
i
had
hoped
that
we
should
be
sent
back
to
the
rancheria
but
alas
no
our
orders
were
to
remain
with
the
division
as
every
available
building
was
occupied
by
troops
the
rangers
as
usual
were
treated
as
outsiders
and
compelled
to
take
to
the
grass
from
the
town
a
spot
was
shown
us
for
our
camp
it
was
on
the
banks
of
a
pretty
rivulet
and
there
having
picketed
our
steeds
stretched
our
canvas
to
the
sun
and
washed
the
dust
from
our
faces
we
made
ourselves
at
home
i
did
not
remain
long
by
the
camp
as
soon
as
the
tents
were
fairly
pitched
i
left
them
and
walked
back
into
the
town
partly
to
get
more
definite
information
as
to
the
future
movements
of
the
army
and
partly
with
the
design
of
indulging
a
little
in
the
social
feeling
i
had
some
old
comrades
among
the
different
regiments
of
the
division
and
after
such
a
long
spell
of
rustication
i
was
not
indisposed
to
refresh
my
spirit
by
the
renewal
of
former
fellowships
at
i
learned
definitely
that
we
should
not
march
for
a
week
at
the
least
so
far
good
and
after
hearing
this
i
proceeded
to
the
the
rendezvous
of
all
the
jovial
spirits
of
the
army
here
i
encountered
the
friends
of
whom
i
was
in
search
and
for
a
short
while
i
found
respite
from
the
thoughts
that
had
been
harrowing
me
i
soon
gathered
the
current
camp
gossip
and
learned
who
were
the
newspaper
heroes
of
the
hour
over
many
of
whose
names
my
friends
and
i
could
not
restrain
either
our
satire
or
laughter
it
appeared
that
the
men
of
deeds
were
scarcely
known
beyond
the
limits
of
the
army
itself
while
others
who
in
the
field
of
battle
had
actually
played
the
poltroon
had
at
home
become
household
words
in
the
mouths
of
the
people
one
general
whom
i
myself
saw
hiding
in
a
ditch
daring
the
rage
of
battle
was
the
theme
of
speech
sentiment
and
song
the
newspapers
were
filled
with
praises
and
the
windows
with
pictures
of
a
gallant
dragoon
officer
who
had
somehow
obtained
the
credit
of
capturing
a
certain
battery
my
rangers
cried
bah
when
i
told
them
this
they
themselves
were
the
men
who
had
first
galloped
over
those
mexican
guns
keeping
an
editor
in
pay
was
a
standing
sarcasm
applicable
to
more
than
one
of
our
generals
and
the
army
correspondent
taking
advantage
of
this
pruriency
for
fame
lived
well
and
swaggered
in
proportional
importance
ah
glory
what
sacrifices
men
make
for
thee
upon
the
shrine
of
conscience
for
my
part
i
do
not
think
i
could
feel
happy
under
the
credit
of
a
feat
i
had
not
performed
surely
the
consciousness
of
having
done
a
deed
is
of
itself
a
sufficient
reward
he
is
but
an
unhappy
hero
who
is
not
a
hero
to
himself
pleasanter
gossip
i
heard
about
the
relations
existing
between
our
troops
and
the
people
of
the
town
many
of
the
inhabitants
had
grown
quite
friendly
in
consequence
of
our
excellent
behaviour
towards
them
our
conduct
was
compared
with
that
which
they
had
lately
experienced
at
the
hands
of
their
own
army
the
latter
was
in
the
habit
of
seizing
property
at
pleasure
on
pretence
of
using
it
for
the
defence
of
the
state
we
on
the
contrary
paid
for
everything
round
prices
too
in
bright
american
dollars
the
ricos
and
merchants
preferred
this
system
and
had
no
objections
to
making
it
permanent
outrages
were
few
on
the
part
of
our
soldiery
and
severely
punished
by
the
general
our
enemies
contrasted
the
modest
bearing
of
the
american
soldier
with
the
conceited
strut
and
insolent
swagger
of
their
own
who
were
wont
on
all
occasions
to
take
the
wall
of
them
it
was
only
outside
the
lines
between
stragglers
and
leperos
that
the
retaliation
system
was
carried
on
so
fiercely
within
the
walls
everything
was
order
with
a
mildness
too
rare
under
martial
law
private
property
was
strictly
regarded
and
private
dwellings
were
not
occupied
by
our
troops
even
the
officers
were
not
billeted
in
private
houses
and
many
of
them
had
to
make
shift
in
rather
uncomfortable
quarters
while
most
of
the
soldiers
lived
under
canvas
this
state
of
things
was
scarcely
satisfactory
to
the
troops
and
some
grumbling
was
heard
there
was
no
complaint
however
from
the
mexicans
who
seemed
rather
astonished
at
so
much
forbearance
on
the
part
of
their
conquerors
i
doubt
whether
in
the
whole
history
of
war
can
be
found
a
conquest
characterised
by
equal
mildness
and
humanity
with
the
second
conquest
of
mexico
it
was
principally
for
this
reason
the
people
had
grown
so
well
affected
towards
us
but
there
was
another
reason
perhaps
not
less
potent
from
the
extensive
operations
we
were
now
about
to
undertake
they
saw
that
we
meant
war
in
earnest
and
the
belief
had
become
general
that
a
large
annexation
was
to
follow
that
perhaps
the
whole
valley
of
the
rio
grande
would
become
american
territory
it
was
but
human
nature
in
them
to
do
homage
to
the
rising
sun
the
ricos
were
better
disposed
towards
us
than
the
common
people
but
this
enigma
is
easily
explained
the
latter
were
more
that
is
more
ready
to
fight
for
native
tyranny
than
accept
freedom
from
a
foreign
hand
is
so
in
all
lands
in
the
event
of
a
war
with
england
the
black
slave
of
carolina
would
range
himself
by
the
side
of
his
master
and
prove
the
bitterest
foe
to
the
enemies
not
of
but
of
his
the
of
mexico
had
good
reasons
for
being
friendly
to
us
they
had
a
stake
to
lose
which
under
their
own
government
had
been
ill
guarded
for
them
no
wonder
they
should
desire
to
come
under
the
broad
protecting
wings
of
the
northern
eagle
i
found
that
another
species
of
annexation
had
been
going
on
during
my
absence
one
of
our
officers
had
become
annexed
to
a
wealthy
senorita
of
the
place
and
the
had
been
performed
with
great
pomp
and
splendour
another
was
talked
of
as
being
and
it
was
expected
that
the
example
would
find
numerous
imitators
i
need
not
say
that
i
was
much
interested
by
these
and
i
returned
with
lighter
heart
to
the
chapter
fifty
four
the
ruined
rancho
the
pleasant
excitement
caused
by
the
visit
to
my
old
comrades
was
soon
over
and
having
nothing
to
do
but
lounge
about
my
tent
i
became
again
the
victim
of
the
same
painful
bodings
i
could
not
shake
them
off
subtle
and
mysterious
is
the
within
us
certainly
does
it
seem
to
have
prescience
of
the
future
is
it
an
electric
chain
connecting
what
is
with
what
is
to
be
or
is
it
the
of
instinct
certainly
there
are
times
when
something
within
whispers
a
warning
as
in
the
physical
world
god
wild
creatures
are
warned
from
without
of
the
earthquake
and
the
storm
how
often
do
we
experience
the
realisation
of
portentous
dreams
why
should
not
the
waking
soul
have
also
its
moments
of
clairvoyance
as
i
lay
stretched
upon
my
leathern
i
gave
way
to
such
reflections
i
soon
succeeded
in
reasoning
myself
into
a
full
belief
in
foreknowledge
and
my
apprehensions
were
proportionately
strengthened
but
i
had
conceived
a
design
and
the
prospect
of
putting
it
in
execution
somewhat
relieved
me
from
the
heaviness
i
had
hitherto
felt
my
new
project
was
to
take
a
score
of
my
best
men
to
ride
back
the
road
we
had
come
place
the
party
in
ambush
near
the
hacienda
while
i
alone
should
enter
the
house
and
further
urge
the
counsels
i
had
committed
to
writing
if
i
should
find
that
these
had
been
already
followed
so
much
the
better
i
should
be
assured
and
return
content
but
i
felt
almost
certain
that
don
ramon
had
rejected
them
at
all
events
i
was
determined
to
know
the
truth
determined
moreover
to
gratify
my
longing
for
one
more
interview
with
my
beloved
i
had
warned
the
men
and
fixed
the
hour
as
soon
it
was
dark
enough
to
conceal
our
departure
from
the
camp
i
had
two
reasons
for
not
starting
earlier
first
because
i
did
not
wish
this
to
be
known
at
it
is
true
that
in
such
matters
we
rangers
had
the
advantage
of
regular
troops
though
belonging
to
the
division
our
duty
was
usually
detached
from
it
and
we
were
rarely
missed
when
absent
there
was
thus
a
sort
of
pleasant
independence
in
my
command
which
i
for
one
fully
appreciated
for
all
that
i
did
not
desire
the
whole
world
to
know
of
an
expedition
like
the
one
projected
my
second
motive
for
going
in
the
night
was
simple
prudence
i
dared
not
take
the
whole
of
my
command
along
with
me
without
permission
from
the
absence
of
the
corps
without
leave
would
certainly
be
noticed
even
were
it
but
for
a
few
hours
and
with
the
smaller
party
i
intended
to
take
caution
would
be
requisite
should
we
move
along
the
road
before
it
was
deserted
some
swift
messenger
might
carry
the
tidings
and
get
us
into
trouble
i
designed
to
start
at
the
earliest
hour
of
darkness
so
that
i
might
not
alarm
the
hacienda
by
a
midnight
visit
an
hour
and
a
half
of
constant
riding
would
bring
me
to
its
gate
at
the
last
moment
of
twilight
we
leaped
into
our
saddles
and
rode
silently
into
the
chapparal
that
skirted
the
camp
after
filing
for
some
distance
through
a
narrow
path
we
debouched
upon
the
road
the
same
that
conducted
to
the
rancheria
the
trappers
rube
and
garey
acting
as
scouts
went
forward
in
the
advance
they
were
on
foot
their
horses
remaining
behind
with
the
party
it
was
a
mode
of
march
i
had
adopted
after
some
experience
in
the
scouts
of
a
marching
force
should
always
go
on
foot
whether
the
main
body
be
dragoons
or
infantry
in
this
manner
they
can
take
advantage
of
the
ground
and
by
keeping
under
cover
of
the
timber
are
enabled
to
reconnoitre
the
angles
of
the
road
in
a
much
safer
way
than
when
on
horseback
the
great
danger
to
a
scout
and
consequently
to
the
party
for
which
he
is
acting
lies
in
his
being
seen
and
the
risk
is
greater
when
he
is
mounted
the
horse
can
not
be
drawn
under
cover
without
an
effort
and
the
sound
of
the
hoof
may
be
heard
whereas
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
a
man
on
foot
that
is
such
a
man
as
either
rube
rawlings
or
bill
garey
will
discover
the
enemy
before
he
is
himself
seen
or
any
ambuscade
can
be
attempted
of
course
the
scout
should
never
advance
beyond
the
possibility
of
retreating
upon
the
party
he
is
guiding
with
full
confidence
in
the
men
who
had
been
sent
forward
we
rode
on
timing
our
pace
so
as
not
to
overtake
them
now
and
then
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
them
at
the
further
end
of
a
long
stretch
skirting
the
bushes
or
stooping
behind
the
cover
to
reconnoitre
the
road
in
advance
to
our
chagrin
it
was
clear
moonlight
and
we
could
distinguish
their
forms
at
a
great
distance
we
should
have
preferred
a
darker
night
the
road
we
were
travelling
upon
was
entirely
without
habitations
most
of
it
ran
through
light
chapparal
forest
with
neither
clearing
nor
homestead
one
solitary
rancho
stood
at
about
equal
distances
between
the
town
and
the
rancheria
and
was
known
among
the
rangers
by
the
familiar
sobriquet
of
the
house
it
was
a
poor
hovel
of
yucca
with
a
small
patch
around
that
had
once
grown
yams
and
a
stock
of
maize
for
whoever
had
tilled
it
but
the
occupants
of
the
little
rancho
had
long
since
disappeared
the
prowling
from
the
camp
had
paid
it
many
a
visit
and
its
household
gods
lay
broken
upon
the
hearth
the
stone
and
red
earthen
ollas
calabash
cups
bedsteads
and
benches
of
the
a
whirligig
spindle
an
old
stringless
or
bandolon
with
other
like
effects
lay
in
fragments
upon
the
floor
mingling
with
these
were
cheap
coloured
of
saints
and
saviour
that
had
been
dragged
from
the
walls
and
with
the
torn
leaves
of
an
old
spanish
trampled
in
dust
and
dishonour
i
paint
this
tableau
of
ruin
not
that
it
was
in
any
way
connected
with
the
events
of
our
narrative
but
that
it
had
strangely
affected
me
on
the
day
before
as
we
rode
past
i
had
halted
a
moment
by
the
rancho
and
contemplated
the
scene
with
a
feeling
of
melancholy
that
amounted
almost
to
sadness
little
thought
i
that
a
still
sadder
spectacle
awaited
me
in
that
same
spot
we
had
approached
within
less
than
of
the
ruined
house
when
a
strange
medley
of
sounds
reached
our
ears
human
voices
they
were
and
borne
upon
the
light
breeze
we
could
distinguish
them
to
be
the
voices
of
women
occasionally
harsher
tones
were
heard
mingling
in
the
murmur
but
most
of
them
had
the
soft
rich
intonation
that
distinguishes
the
female
voice
we
all
drew
bridle
and
listened
the
sounds
continued
in
the
same
confused
chorus
but
there
was
neither
song
nor
joy
in
the
accents
on
the
contrary
the
carried
upon
its
wings
the
voices
of
lamentation
and
wailing
there
are
women
in
trouble
remarked
one
of
my
followers
in
a
suggestive
tone
the
remark
caused
all
of
us
simultaneously
to
ply
the
spur
and
ride
forward
before
we
had
galloped
a
dozen
lengths
a
man
appeared
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
and
advancing
rapidly
up
the
middle
of
the
road
we
saw
it
was
the
scout
garey
and
once
more
reining
up
we
awaited
his
approach
i
was
at
the
head
of
the
little
troop
and
as
the
trapper
drew
near
i
could
see
his
face
full
under
the
light
of
the
moon
its
expression
was
ominous
of
evil
tidings
he
spoke
not
until
he
had
laid
his
hand
upon
the
pommel
of
my
saddle
and
then
only
in
a
subdued
and
saddened
tone
his
words
were
thar
ugly
news
oh
that
terrible
foreboding
news
ill
news
i
stammered
out
what
for
heaven
sake
speak
garey
they
been
playin
the
devil
at
the
rancherie
them
ruffins
hez
behaved
wuss
than
injuns
would
a
done
but
ride
forrard
an
see
for
yurself
the
weemen
are
clost
by
hyar
at
the
shanty
rube
a
tryin
to
pacify
them
poor
critters
oh
that
terrible
foreboding
i
made
no
response
to
garey
last
speech
but
rode
forward
as
fast
as
my
horse
could
carry
me
a
brace
of
minutes
brought
me
up
to
the
rancho
and
there
i
beheld
a
spectacle
that
caused
the
blood
to
curdle
in
my
veins
chapter
fifty
five
a
cruel
proscription
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
hovel
was
occupied
by
a
group
of
women
most
of
them
young
girls
there
were
six
or
seven
i
did
not
count
them
there
were
two
or
three
men
mexicans
mixed
up
in
the
group
rube
was
in
their
midst
endeavouring
in
his
broken
spanish
to
give
them
consolation
and
assurance
of
safety
poor
victims
they
needed
both
the
women
were
some
of
them
simply
their
long
black
hair
fell
loosely
over
their
shoulders
looking
tossed
wet
and
draggly
there
was
blood
upon
it
there
was
blood
upon
their
cheeks
in
seams
half
dried
but
still
dropping
the
same
horrid
red
mottled
their
necks
and
bosoms
and
there
was
blood
upon
the
hands
that
had
wiped
them
a
blotch
appeared
upon
the
foreheads
of
all
in
the
moonlight
it
looked
as
if
the
skin
had
been
burnt
i
rode
closer
to
one
and
examined
it
it
was
a
brand
the
of
iron
the
skin
around
was
scarlet
but
in
the
midst
of
this
halo
of
inflammation
i
could
distinguish
from
their
darker
hue
the
outlines
of
the
two
letters
i
wore
upon
my
button
the
she
who
was
nearest
me
raised
her
hands
and
tossing
back
from
her
cheeks
the
thick
clustered
hair
cried
out
senor
oh
heaven
my
flesh
crept
as
i
looked
upon
the
source
of
that
crimson
haemorrhage
her
ears
had
been
cut
off
they
were
wanting
i
needed
no
further
uplifting
of
their
hair
to
satisfy
me
that
the
others
had
been
served
in
like
manner
the
red
stream
still
trickling
adown
their
necks
was
evidence
enough
the
men
too
had
been
similarly
abused
two
of
them
had
suffered
still
further
mutilation
they
held
up
their
right
arms
before
my
face
not
their
hands
were
no
i
saw
the
hanging
sleeve
and
the
bandage
on
the
stump
their
hands
had
been
chopped
off
at
the
wrists
horrid
sight
both
men
and
women
gathered
around
me
clasping
my
knees
and
uttering
prayers
and
entreaties
no
doubt
most
of
them
were
known
to
me
by
sight
but
their
features
were
now
unrecognisable
they
had
been
the
friends
and
sweethearts
of
the
corps
and
my
followers
were
already
addressing
them
by
name
the
lovers
of
one
or
two
were
present
sadly
embracing
them
one
appeared
more
richly
costumed
than
the
rest
and
upon
her
my
eyes
had
fallen
as
i
first
rode
up
i
almost
dreaded
to
approach
her
as
she
stood
a
little
apart
but
no
it
could
not
be
she
was
not
tall
enough
besides
the
ruffians
would
not
dare
your
name
senorita
hija
del
the
tears
burst
from
her
eyes
mingling
with
blood
as
they
ran
down
her
cheeks
oh
that
i
too
could
have
wept
poor
wheatley
he
was
not
with
us
he
had
yet
to
receive
the
blow
it
would
soon
fall
my
heart
was
on
fire
so
were
those
of
my
followers
they
swore
and
foamed
at
the
mouth
some
drew
pistols
and
knives
calling
out
to
me
to
lead
them
on
never
saw
i
men
in
such
a
frenzy
of
rage
the
most
among
them
seemed
to
have
suddenly
gone
mad
i
could
scarcely
restrain
them
till
we
should
hear
the
tale
we
guessed
it
already
but
we
needed
some
details
to
guide
us
in
the
execution
of
vengeance
it
was
told
by
many
mouths
interrupting
or
confirming
one
another
one
of
the
men
was
more
coherent
pedro
who
used
to
sell
mezcal
to
the
troop
to
him
we
listened
the
substance
of
his
story
was
as
follows
shortly
after
we
had
left
the
rancheria
it
was
entered
by
the
guerrilleros
with
cries
of
santa
anna
viva
and
to
the
they
commenced
by
breaking
open
the
and
drinking
mezcal
and
whatever
they
could
find
they
were
joined
by
the
mob
of
the
place
by
and
others
pedro
noticed
the
blacksmith
and
the
taking
a
conspicuous
part
there
were
many
women
in
the
mob
the
mistresses
of
the
guerrilleros
and
others
of
the
town
after
drinking
a
while
they
grew
more
excited
then
was
heard
the
cry
los
and
the
crowd
scattering
in
different
directions
entered
the
houses
shouting
afuera
drag
them
out
kill
them
the
poor
girls
and
all
who
had
been
friendly
to
the
were
dragged
into
the
piazza
amidst
the
oaths
and
execrations
of
the
guerrilla
and
hissings
and
hootings
from
the
mob
they
were
spit
upon
called
by
filthy
names
pelted
with
mud
and
and
then
some
of
the
crowd
suggested
that
they
should
be
so
that
their
friends
the
should
know
them
again
the
suggestion
was
adopted
the
women
more
fiendish
than
the
men
exciting
the
latter
to
the
deed
voices
were
heard
calling
to
the
blacksmith
el
fierro
traiga
el
bring
the
others
cried
out
las
cut
off
their
ears
the
brutal
blacksmith
and
butcher
both
half
drunk
obeyed
the
call
willingly
pedro
alleged
the
former
used
the
already
prepared
while
the
latter
performed
his
bloody
office
with
the
knife
of
his
trade
most
of
the
guerrilleros
wore
masks
the
leaders
were
all
masked
and
watched
the
proceedings
from
the
roof
of
the
alcalde
house
one
pedro
knew
in
spite
of
his
disguise
he
knew
him
by
his
great
size
and
red
hair
it
was
the
el
zorro
others
he
guessed
at
but
he
had
no
doubt
it
was
the
band
of
don
rafael
ijurra
nor
had
we
had
they
left
the
rancheria
before
pedro
and
the
others
came
away
pedro
thought
not
he
and
the
other
victims
as
soon
as
they
got
out
of
the
hands
of
the
mob
had
fled
to
the
chapparal
and
were
making
for
the
american
camp
when
met
by
our
scouts
they
were
straggling
along
the
road
one
after
the
other
rube
had
detained
them
by
the
rancho
till
we
should
come
up
pedro
feared
that
they
were
not
all
who
had
suffered
that
there
were
other
victims
the
alcalde
he
feared
had
been
worse
than
mutilated
he
had
been
this
last
information
the
poor
fellow
imparted
in
a
whisper
at
the
same
time
casting
a
sorrowful
look
towards
conchita
i
had
not
the
courage
to
inquire
further
the
question
arose
whether
we
should
send
back
for
more
men
and
wait
till
they
arrived
or
advance
at
once
to
the
rancheria
the
former
was
negatived
with
unanimous
voice
we
were
strong
enough
and
vengeance
was
impatient
i
was
joyed
by
this
decision
could
not
have
waited
the
women
were
directed
to
continue
on
to
the
pedro
mounted
behind
one
of
the
men
should
go
with
us
we
needed
him
for
purposes
of
we
were
about
to
move
forward
when
a
figure
appeared
along
the
road
in
the
direction
we
were
going
to
take
on
coming
within
sight
of
us
the
figure
was
seen
to
skulk
and
hide
in
the
bushes
rube
and
garey
ran
rapidly
forward
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
bringing
with
them
a
mexican
youth
another
of
the
victims
he
had
left
the
scene
of
his
sufferings
somewhat
later
than
the
rest
was
the
guerrilla
still
in
the
place
no
they
were
gone
from
the
village
whither
was
the
anxious
interrogatory
they
had
taken
the
road
the
hacienda
de
they
had
passed
the
boy
as
he
lay
concealed
among
some
magueys
he
had
heard
their
cries
as
they
rushed
past
what
cries
they
shouted

traidor

traidora

chapter
fifty
six
the
bivouac
of
the
guerrilla
i
stayed
to
hear
no
more
but
drove
the
spur
against
the
ribs
of
my
horse
till
he
sprang
in
full
gallop
along
the
road
eager
as
were
my
men
to
follow
was
as
much
as
they
could
do
to
keep
up
we
no
longer
thought
of
scouts
or
cautious
marching
the
trappers
had
mounted
and
were
galloping
with
the
rest
we
thought
only
of
we
rode
for
the
hacienda
de
vargas
straight
up
the
river
although
it
was
beyond
the
rancheria
we
could
reach
it
without
passing
through
the
latter
which
lay
some
distance
back
from
the
stream
we
could
return
to
the
village
afterwards
but
first
for
the
hacienda
there
i
wished
to
arrive
in
the
shortest
time
possible
the
miles
flew
behind
us
like
the
dust
of
the
road
oh
should
we
not
be
in
time
i
feared
to
calculate
the
length
of
the
interval
since
the
boy
had
heard
that
rabble
rout
was
it
more
than
an
hour
five
miles
to
the
rancho
and
he
on
foot
had
he
travelled
rapidly
yes
here
and
there
but
he
had
made
a
stop
some
men
had
passed
him
and
he
had
hidden
in
the
bushes
till
they
were
out
of
sight
he
had
been
more
than
an
hour
on
the
way
nearly
two
and
one
would
be
enough
for
the
execution
of
the
darkest
deed
oh
we
should
not
arrive
in
time
there
was
no
delay
now
we
were
going
at
and
in
silence
scarcely
exchanging
a
word
alone
might
be
heard
the
clattering
of
hoofs
the
chinking
of
bits
or
the
ringing
of
steel
scabbards
neither
the
slimy
gutter
nor
the
deep
rut
of
wheels
stayed
our
advance
our
horses
leaped
over
or
went
sweltering
through
them
in
five
minutes
we
came
to
the
where
the
road
forked
the
left
branch
leading
to
the
village
we
saw
no
one
and
kept
on
by
the
right
the
direct
road
to
the
hacienda
another
mile
and
we
should
reach
the
house
a
quarter
of
that
distance
and
we
should
come
in
sight
of
it
the
trees
alone
hindered
our
view
of
its
walls
on
on
what
means
that
light
is
the
sun
rising
in
the
west
is
the
chapparal
on
fire
whence
comes
the
yellow
gleam
half
intercepted
by
the
trunks
of
the
trees
is
it
not
the
moon
ho
the
hacienda
is
in
flames
no
it
can
not
be
a
house
of
stone
with
scarcely
enough
timber
to
make
a
blaze
it
can
not
be
that
it
is
not
that
we
emerge
from
the
forest
the
hacienda
is
before
our
eyes
its
white
walls
gleam
under
a
yellow
light
the
light
of
fire
but
not
of
a
conflagration
the
house
stands
intact
a
huge
bonfire
burns
in
front
of
the
portal
it
was
this
that
caused
the
glare
through
the
forest
we
draw
up
and
gaze
upon
it
with
surprise
we
behold
a
huge
pile
the
material
supplied
from
the
household
stock
of
dry
faggots
a
vast
blaze
drowning
the
pale
moonshine
we
can
see
the
hacienda
and
all
around
it
as
distinctly
as
by
the
light
of
day
for
what
purpose
this
holocaust
of
crackling
acacias
around
the
fire
we
behold
many
forms
living
and
moving
there
are
men
women
dogs
and
saddled
horses
huge
joints
are
roasting
over
the
red
coals
and
others
roasted
are
being
greedily
eaten
are
they
savages
who
surround
that
blazing
pile
no
we
can
see
their
faces
with
full
distinctness
the
white
skins
and
black
beards
of
the
men
the
cotton
garments
of
the
women
we
can
see
sombreros
and
serapes
cloth
cloaks
and
calzoneros
of
velveteen
sashes
and
sabres
we
can
distinguish
their
voices
as
they
shout
sing
and
carouse
we
note
their
lascivious
movements
in
the
national
dance
the
no
indians
they
is
a
bivouac
of
the
guerrilleros
the
ruffians
for
whom
we
are
in
search
oh
that
i
had
listened
to
the
voice
of
prudence
and
adopted
the
strategy
of
a
surround
but
my
blood
was
boiling
and
i
feared
to
lose
even
a
moment
of
time
lest
we
might
be
too
late
but
one
or
two
of
my
followers
counselled
delay
and
as
the
event
proved
they
were
the
wisest
the
rest
like
myself
were
impatient
for
action
the
word
was
given
and
like
hounds
fresh
loosed
from
the
leash
we
rushed
forward
with
charging
cheer
it
was
the
madness
of
fools
well
knew
our
enemy
the
hoarse
texan
hurrah
it
had
been
shouted
to
terrify
them
when
there
was
no
need
they
would
never
have
stood
ground
the
shout
warned
them
causing
them
to
scatter
like
a
herd
of
deer
the
steep
hill
proved
too
heavy
for
our
horses
and
before
we
could
reach
its
summit
the
main
body
of
the
guerrilla
had
mounted
and
scampered
off
into
the
darkness
six
of
them
fell
to
our
shots
and
as
many
more
with
their
remained
prisoners
in
our
hands
but
as
usual
that
subtle
coward
had
contrived
to
escape
pursuit
was
idle
they
had
taken
to
the
dark
woods
beyond
the
hill
i
thought
not
of
pursuit
my
mind
was
bent
on
a
far
different
purpose
i
rode
into
the
the
court
was
lit
up
by
the
glare
of
the
fire
it
presented
a
picture
of
ruin
rich
furniture
was
scattered
about
in
the
verandah
and
over
the
pavement
broken
or
tumbled
down
i
called
her
name
the
name
of
don
ramon
loudly
and
earnestly
did
i
raise
my
voice
but
echo
gave
the
only
reply
i
dismounted
and
rushed
into
the
verandah
still
vociferating
and
still
without
receiving
a
response
i
hurried
from
room
to
room
from
to
from
to
up
to
the
azotea
everywhere
even
to
the
in
the
rear
the
moonbeams
gleamed
upon
the
altar
but
no
human
form
was
there
the
whole
house
was
deserted
the
domestics
even
the
women
of
the
had
disappeared
my
horse
and
i
seemed
the
only
living
things
within
those
walls
for
my
followers
had
remained
outside
with
their
prisoners
a
sudden
hope
gleamed
across
my
heart
perhaps
they
had
taken
my
counsel
and
gone
off
before
the
mob
appeared
heaven
grant
it
might
be
so
i
rushed
out
to
question
the
captives
they
should
know
both
men
and
women
they
could
certainly
tell
me
a
glance
showed
me
i
was
too
late
to
receive
information
from
the
men
a
large
tree
stood
at
one
corner
of
the
building
the
firelight
glared
upon
it
from
its
branches
hung
six
human
forms
with
drooping
heads
and
feet
far
from
the
earth
they
had
just
ceased
to
live
one
told
me
that
the
herredero
was
among
them
and
also
the
cruel
matador
pedro
had
identified
both
the
others
were
of
the
town
who
had
borne
part
in
the
affair
of
the
day
their
judges
had
made
quick
work
and
equally
quick
had
been
the
ceremony
of
execution
lazos
had
been
reeved
over
the
limbs
of
the
pecan
and
with
these
all
six
had
been
jerked
up
without
shrift
or
prayer
it
was
not
revenge
for
which
i
panted
i
turned
to
the
women
many
of
these
had
made
off
but
there
were
still
a
dozen
or
more
in
the
hands
of
the
men
they
looked
haggard
with
drink
some
sullen
and
some
terrified
they
had
reason
to
be
afraid
in
answer
to
my
questions
they
shook
their
heads
but
gave
me
no
information
some
remained
doggedly
silent
others
denied
all
knowledge
of
don
ramon
or
his
daughter
threats
had
no
effect
they
either
knew
not
or
to
what
had
befallen
them
oh
heaven
could
it
be
the
latter
i
was
turning
away
angered
and
despairing
when
my
eyes
fell
upon
a
figure
that
seemed
to
skulk
under
the
shadow
of
the
walls
a
shout
of
joy
escaped
me
as
i
recognised
the
boy
cyprio
just
emerging
from
his
place
of
concealment
cyprio
i
cried
answered
he
advancing
rapidly
to
where
i
stood
tell
me
cyprio
where
are
they
gone
where
where
these
bad
men
have
carried
the
away
i
do
not
know
whither
the
senora
the
senora
oh
es
una
cosa
it
is
a
terrible
thing
quick
tell
me
all
quickly
cyprio
senor
there
came
men
with
black
masks
who
broke
into
the
house
and
carried
off
the
master
then
they
dragged
out
dona
isolina
into
the
patio
de
i
can
not
tell
you
what
they
did
before
there
was
blood
running
down
her
neck
and
over
her
breast
she
was
not
dressed
and
i
could
see
it
some
went
to
the
caballeriza
and
led
out
the
white
horse
the
steed
that
was
brought
from
the
upon
his
back
they
bound
dona
isolina
me
such
a
sight
go
on
then
senor
they
led
the
horse
across
the
river
and
out
to
the
plain
beyond
all
went
along
to
see
the
sport
as
they
said
de
such
sport
i
did
not
go
for
they
beat
and
threatened
to
kill
me
but
i
saw
all

chapter
fifty
seven
taking
the
trail
i
had
merely
swooned
my
nerves
and
frame
were
still
weak
from
the
i
had
received
in
the
combat
of
yesterday
the
shock
of
the
horrid
news
was
too
much
for
my
powers
of
endurance
i
was
insensible
only
for
a
short
while
the
cold
water
revived
me
when
consciousness
returned
i
was
by
the
fountain
my
back
leaning
against
its
parapet
edge
rube
garey
and
others
were
around
me
from
my
dripping
garments
i
perceived
that
they
had
me
and
one
was
pouring
a
fiery
spirit
down
my
throat
there
were
men
on
horseback
who
had
ridden
into
the
patio
the
iron
hoofs
causing
the
court
to
ring
they
were
rangers
but
not
those
who
had
left
camp
in
my
company
some
had
arrived
since
and
others
were
still
galloping
up
the
girls
had
reached
the
ranger
camp
and
told
their
tale
the
men
had
not
waited
for
orders
or
even
for
one
another
but
rushing
to
their
horses
took
the
road
in
twos
and
threes
every
moment
a
horseman
or
several
together
came
riding
forward
in
hot
haste
carrying
their
rifles
as
if
ready
for
action
and
uttering
loud
cries
of
indignation
wheatley
had
arrived
among
the
foremost
poor
fellow
his
habitual
buoyancy
had
departed
the
gay
smile
was
gone
from
his
lips
his
eyes
were
on
fire
and
his
teeth
set
in
the
stern
expression
of
vengeance
amidst
the
hoarse
shouting
of
the
men
i
heard
screaming
in
the
shriller
voices
of
women
it
came
from
without
i
rose
hastily
and
ran
towards
the
spot
i
saw
several
of
the
wretched
captives
stripped
to
the
waist
and
men
in
the
act
of
flogging
them
with
and
pieces
of
rope
i
had
feared
it
was
worse
i
had
feared
that
their
captors
were
inflicting
upon
them
a
in
but
no
angry
as
were
my
followers
they
had
not
proceeded
to
such
a
fiendish
extremity
it
required
all
the
authority
of
a
command
to
put
an
end
to
the
distressing
spectacle
they
desisted
at
length
and
the
screeching
and
affrighted
wretches
were
permitted
to
take
themselves
away
all
disappearing
rapidly
beyond
the
light
of
the
fire
at
this
crisis
a
shout
was
raised
to
the
rancheria
to
the
rancheria
and
instantly
a
party
with
wheatley
and
holingsworth
at
its
head
rode
off
for
the
village
pedro
went
along
with
them
i
waited
not
for
their
return
i
had
formed
a
plan
of
action
for
myself
that
would
admit
of
no
delay
in
its
execution
at
first
stunned
by
the
blow
and
the
distraction
of
my
swooning
senses
i
had
not
been
able
to
as
soon
as
the
confusion
passed
and
i
could
reflect
more
clearly
the
course
i
ought
to
pursue
was
at
once
apparent
vengeance
i
had
felt
as
the
first
impulse
and
a
strong
desire
to
follow
up
the
fiend
ijurra
night
and
day
to
follow
him
though
the
pursuit
should
lead
me
into
the
heart
of
the
hostile
ground
this
was
but
a
momentary
impulse
vengeance
must
be
stifled
for
the
time
a
path
was
to
be
taken
that
widely
diverged
from
that
of
the
retreating
guerrilla
trail
of
the
white
mounting
cyprio
and
choosing
from
my
band
of
the
best
was
the
work
of
a
moment
in
another
we
were
in
the
saddle
and
descending
the
hill
we
plunged
rapidly
through
the
stream
crossed
the
skirting
timber
and
soon
rode
out
upon
the
open
prairie
under
cyprio
guidance
we
found
the
spot
desecrated
by
that
cruel
display
the
ground
was
trampled
by
many
hoofs
fragments
of
paper
broken
and
fuses
strewed
the
sward
the
pyrotechnic
of
the
fiendish
spectacle
we
halted
not
there
by
the
aid
of
our
guide
and
the
moonlight
we
rode
clear
of
the
confusion
and
taking
up
the
trail
of
the
horse
struck
off
upon
it
and
were
soon
far
out
upon
the
prairie
for
more
than
a
mile
we
advanced
at
a
gallop
time
was
everything
trusting
to
the
intelligence
of
the
mexican
boy
we
scarcely
scrutinised
the
track
but
made
directly
for
the
point
where
the
horse
had
been
last
seen
cyprio
information
did
not
deceive
us
a
of
timber
had
served
him
as
a
mark
the
steed
had
passed
close
to
its
edge
beyond
it
he
had
seen
him
no
more
and
the
boy
was
sent
back
beyond
it
we
found
the
tracks
easily
recognisable
by
rube
garey
and
myself
there
was
a
peculiarity
by
which
we
were
prevented
from
mistaking
them
three
of
the
prints
were
clearly
cut
in
the
turf
almost
perfect
circles
the
curve
of
the
fourth
of
the
off
was
interrupted
by
a
slight
indentation
where
a
piece
had
been
broken
from
the
hoof
it
had
been
done
in
that
terrible
leap
upon
the
rocky
bed
of
the
barranca
taking
the
trail
again
we
kept
on
now
advancing
at
a
slower
pace
and
with
a
greater
degree
of
caution
late
rain
had
moistened
the
and
we
could
perceive
the
racks
without
dismounting
at
intervals
there
were
stretches
of
drier
surface
where
the
hoof
had
scarcely
left
its
impression
in
such
places
one
leaped
from
the
saddle
and
led
the
way
on
foot
rube
or
garey
usually
performed
this
office
and
so
rapidly
did
they
move
along
the
trail
that
our
horses
were
seldom
in
a
walk
with
bodies
half
bent
and
eyes
gliding
along
the
ground
they
pressed
forward
like
hounds
running
by
the
scent
but
unlike
these
the
trackers
made
no
noise
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
any
one
i
had
no
list
for
speech
my
agony
was
too
intense
for
utterance
with
cyprio
i
had
conversed
upon
the
harrowing
theme
and
that
only
at
starting
from
him
i
had
gathered
further
details
no
doubt
the
matador
had
performed
his
office
oh
god
without
ears
cyprio
had
seen
blood
it
was
streaming
adown
her
neck
and
over
her
bosom
her
slight
garments
were
stained
red
with
it
he
knew
not
whence
it
came
or
why
she
was
bleeding
he
was
not
present
when
that
blood
had
been
drawn
it
was
in
her
chamber
he
thought
she
was
bleeding
when
the
ruffians
dragged
her
forth
belike
too
the
herredero
had
done
his
work
cyprio
had
seen
the
blacksmith
but
not
the
he
heard
they
had
branded
some
at
the
piazza
among
others
the
daughter
of
the
alcalde
he
did
not
see
them
brand
the
dona
isolina
the
ruffian
deed
might
have
been
accomplished
for
all
that
there
was
plenty
of
time
while
the
boy
lay
hid
or
before
she
had
been
dragged
from
her
chamber
how
was
she
placed
upon
the
horse
despite
my
heart
bitterness
as
i
put
these
interrogatories
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
cossack
legend
the
famed
classic
picture
came
vividly
before
my
mind
wide
was
the
distance
between
the
ukraine
and
the
rio
bravo
had
the
monsters
who
this
scene
on
the
banks
of
the
mexican
river
had
these
ever
heard
of
mazeppa
possibly
their
leader
had
but
it
was
still
more
probable
that
the
fiendish
thought
was
original
the
fashion
at
least
was
cyprio
had
seen
and
described
it
she
was
laid
longitudinally
upon
the
back
of
the
steed
her
head
resting
upon
the
point
of
his
shoulder
her
face
was
downward
her
cheek
touching
the
withers
her
arms
embraced
the
neck
and
her
wrists
were
made
fast
under
the
animal
throat
her
body
was
held
in
this
position
by
means
of
a
belt
around
her
waist
attached
to
a
surcingle
on
the
horse
both
tightly
buckled
in
addition
to
this
her
ankles
bound
together
by
a
thong
were
fastened
to
the
croup
with
her
feet
projecting
beyond
the
hips
i
groaned
as
i
listened
to
the
details
the
ligature
was
perfect
cruelly
complete
there
was
no
hope
that
such
fastenings
would
give
way
those
thongs
of
would
not
come
undone
horse
and
rider
could
never
part
from
that
unwilling
embrace
never
till
hunger
thirst
death
no
not
even
death
could
part
them
oh
horror
not
without
groans
could
i
contemplate
the
hideous
fate
of
my
betrothed
of
her
whose
love
had
become
my
life
i
left
the
tracking
to
my
comrades
and
my
horse
to
follow
after
i
rode
with
loose
rein
and
head
drooping
forward
i
scarcely
gave
thought
to
design
my
heart
was
broken
chapter
fifty
eight
the
voyageur
we
had
not
gone
far
when
some
one
closed
up
beside
me
and
muttered
a
word
of
cheer
i
recognised
the
friendly
voice
of
the
big
trapper

in

tone
of

in

i
began
to
feel
hope
it
was
but
a
momentary
gleam
and
died
out
in
the
next
instant
if
the
moon
only
hold
out
continued

with

emphasis
denoting

who
had
uttered
the
unpleasant
prognostication
in

peevish

tone
all
eyes
were
turned
upward
the
moon
round
and
white
was
sailing
through
a
cloudless
sky
and
almost
in
the
zenith
how
then
was
she
to
give
out
she
was

i
needed
not
to
inquire
the
consequences
should
rube
prediction
prove
correct
that
was
evident
to
all
of
us
the
moon
once
obscured
by
clouds
our
progress
would
be
arrested
even
a
horse
could
not
be
tracked
in
the
darkness
we
were
not
long
in
suspense
again
the
foresight
of
the
old
trapper
proved
unerring
cumuli
rolled
up
the
sky
one
after
another
until
their
black
masses
shrouded
the
moon
at
first
they
came
only
in
detached
clouds
and
there
was
light
at
intervals
but
these
were
only
the
advanced
columns
of
a
heavier
body
that
soon
after
appeared
and
without
a
break
spread
itself
over
the
firmament
the
moon
disc
became
entirely
hidden
from
our
view
her
scattered
beams
died
out
and
the
prairie
lay
dark
as
if
shadowed
by
an
eclipse
we
could
follow
the
trail
no
farther
the
ground
itself
was
not
visible
much
less
the
we
had
been
tracing
and
halting
simultaneously
we
drew
our
horses
togther
and
sat
in
our
saddles
to
deliberate
upon
what
was
best
to
be
done
the
consultation
was
a
short
one
they
who
formed
that
little
party
were
all
men
of
prairie
or
backwoods
experience
and
well
versed
in
the
ways
of
the
wilderness
it
took
them
but
little
time
to
decide
what
course
should
be
followed
and
they
were
unanimous
in
their
opinion
should
the
sky
continue
clouded
we
must
give
up
the
pursuit
till
morning
or
adopt
the
only
alternative
follow
the
trail
by
of
course
the
latter
was
determined
upon
it
was
yet
early
in
the
night
many
hours
must
intervene
before
we
should
have
the
light
of
day
i
could
not
live
through
those
long
hours
without
action
even
though
our
progress
might
be
slow
the
knowledge
that
we
were
advancing
would
help
to
stifle
the
painfulness
of
reflection
a
torch
a
torch
where
was
such
a
thing
to
be
procured
we
had
with
us
no
material
with
which
to
make

there
was

were

chapter
fifty
nine
trailing
by
while
thus
inactive
my
mind
yielded
itself
up
to
the
contemplation
of
painful
probabilities
horrid
spectacles
passed
before
my
imagination
i
saw
the
white
horse
galloping
over
the
plain
pursued
by
wolves
and
shadowed
by
black
vultures
to
escape
these
hungry
pursuers
i
saw
him
dash
into
the
thick
chapparal
there
to
encounter
the
red
panther
or
the
fierce
prowling
bear
there
to
encounter
the
sharp
thorns
of
the
acacias
the
barbed
spines
of
the
cactus
and
the
recurving
armature
of
the
wild
aloes
i
could
see
the
red
blood
streaming
adown
his
white
flanks
not
blood
but
that
of
the
helpless
victim
stretched
prostrate
along
his
back
i
could
see
the
lacerated
limbs
the
ankles
chafed
and
swollen
the
garments
torn
to
shreds
the
drooping
head
the
long
loose
hair
tossed
and
trailing
to
the
earth
the
white
wan
lips
the
eyes
oh
i
could
bear
my
reflections
no
longer
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
paced
the
prairie
with
the
aimless
unsteady
step
of
a
madman
again
the
trapper
approached
and
renewed
his
efforts
to
console
me
we
could
follow
the
trail
he
said
by
torch
or
candle
light
almost
as
fast
as
we
could
travel
we
should
be
many
miles
along
it
before
morning
maybe
before
then
we
should
get
sight
of
the
steed
it
would
not
be
hard
to
surround
and
capture
him
now
that
he
was
he
might
not
run
from
us
if
he
did
he
could
be
overtaken
once
in
view
we
would
not
lose
sight
of
him
again
the
saynyora
would
be
safe
enough
there
was
nothing
to
hurt
her
the
wolves
would
not
know
the
she
was
in
neyther
the
nor
we
should
be
sure
to
come
up
with
her
before
the
next
night
an
would
find
her
a
little
tired
and
hungry
no
doubt
but
nothing
to
hurt
we
should
relieve
her
and
rest
would
set
all
right
again
notwithstanding
the
rude
phrase
in
which
these
consolatory
remarks
were
made
i
appreciated
their
kind
intention
garey
speech
had
the
effect
of
rendering
me
more
hopeful
and
in
calmer
mood
i
awaited
the
return
of
quackenboss
and
the
canadian
these
did
not
linger
two
hours
had
been
allowed
them
to
perform
their
errand
but
long
before
the
expiration
of
that
period
we
heard
the
double
tramp
of
their
horses
as
they
came
galloping
across
the
plain
in
a
few
minutes
they
rode
up
and
we
could
see
in
the
hands
of
le
blanc
three
whitish
objects
that
in
length
and
thickness
resembled
stout
we
recognised
chandelles
they
were
the
property
of
the
church
designed
no
doubt
to
have
illumined
the
altar
upon
the
occasion
of
some
grand
de
voila
mon
capitaine
cried
the
canadian
as
he
rode
forward
voila

ah

brave

the
messengers
had
brought
news
from
the
village
some
rough
proceedings
had
taken
place
since
our
departure
men
had
been
punished
fresh
victims
had
been
found
under
the
guidance
of
pedro
and
others
of
the
abused
the
trees
in
the
church
enclosure
that
night
bore
horrid
fruit
the
alcalde
was
not
dead
and
don
ramon
it
was
supposed
still
survived
but
had
been
carried
off
a
prisoner
by
the
guerrilla
the
rangers
were
yet
at
the
rancheria
many
had
been
desirous
of
returning
with
le
blanc
and
quackenboss
but
i
had
sent
orders
to
the
lieutenants
to
take
all
back
to
camp
as
soon
as
their
affair
was
over
the
fewer
of
the
troop
that
should
be
absent
the
less
likelihood
of
our
being
missed
and
those
i
had
with
me
i
deemed
enough
for
my
purpose
whether
successful
or
not
we
should
soon
return
to
camp
it
would
then
be
time
to
devise
some
scheme
for
capturing
the
leader
and
prime
actor
in
this
terrible
tragedy
hardly
waiting
to
hear
the
story
we
lighted
the
great
candles
and
moved
once
more
along
the
trail
fortunately
the
breeze
was
but
slight
and
only
served
to
make
the
huge
waxen
torches
flare
more
freely
by
their
brilliant
blaze
we
were
enabled
to
take
up
the
tracks
quite
as
rapidly
as
by
the
moonlight
at
this
point
the
horse
had
been
still
going
at
full
gallop
and
his
course
as
it
ran
in
a
direct
line
was
the
more
easily
followed
dark
as
the
night
was
we
soon
perceived
we
were
heading
for
a
point
well
known
to
all
of
us
the
prairie
mound
and
under
a
faint
belief
that
the
steed
might
have
there
come
to
a
stop
we
pressed
forward
with
a
sort
of
hopeful
anticipation
after
an
hour
tracking
the
white
cliffs
loomed
within
the
circle
of
our
view
the
shining
selenite
glancing
back
the
light
of
our
tapers
like
a
wall
set
with
diamonds
we
approached
with
caution
still
keeping
on
the
trail
but
also
keenly
scrutinising
the
ground
in
advance
of
us
in
hopes
of
perceiving
the
object
of
our
search
neither
by
the
cliff
nor
in
the
gloom
around
was
living
form
to
be
traced
sure
enough
the
steed
had
halted
there
or
at
all
events
ceased
from
his
wild
gallop
he
had
approached
the
mound
in
a
walk
as
the
tracks
testified
but
how
and
in
what
direction
had
he
gone
thence
his
no
longer
appeared
he
had
passed
over
the
shingle
that
covered
the
plain
to
a
distance
of
many
yards
from
the
base
of
the
cliff
and
no
track
could
be
found
beyond
several
times
we
went
around
the
mesa
carrying
our
candles
everywhere
we
saw
skeletons
of
men
and
horses
with
skulls
detached
fragments
of
dresses
and
pieces
of
broken
armour
souvenirs
of
our
late
skirmish
we
looked
into
our
little
fortress
and
gazed
upon
the
rock
that
had
sheltered
us
we
glanced
up
the
gorge
where
we
had
climbed
and
beheld
the
rope
by
which
we
had
descended
still
hanging
in
its
place
all
these
we
saw
but
no
further
traces
of
the
steed
round
and
round
we
went
back
and
forward
over
the
stony
shingle
and
along
its
outer
edge
but
still
without
coming
upon
the
tracks
whither
could
the
horse
have
gone
perhaps
with
a
better
light
we
might
have
found
the
trail
but
for
a
long
hour
we
searched
without
striking
upon
any
sign
of
it
perhaps
we
might
still
have
found
it
even
with
our
waxen
torches
but
for
an
incident
that
not
only
interrupted
our
search
but
filled
us
with
fresh
apprehension
and
almost
stifled
our
hopes
of
success
the
interruption
did
not
come
unexpected
the
clouds
had
for
some
time
given
ample
warning
the
big
solitary
drops
that
at
intervals
fell
with
plashing
noise
upon
the
rocks
were
but
the
of
one
of
the
great
rainstorms
of
the
prairie
when
water
descends
as
if
from
a
we
knew
from
the
signs
that
such
a
storm
was
nigh
and
while
casting
around
to
recover
the
trail
it
came
down
in
all
its
fury
almost
in
an
instant
our
lights
were
extinguished
and
our
bootless
search
brought
to
a
termination
we
drew
up
under
the
rocks
and
stood
side
by
side
in
sullen
silence
even
the
elements
seemed
against
me
in
my
heart
bitterness
i
cursed
them
chapter
sixty
the
sombrero
the
horses
cowered
under
the
cold
rain
all
of
them
jaded
and
hungry
the
hot
dusty
march
of
the
morning
and
the
long
rough
gallop
of
the
night
had
exhausted
their
strength
and
they
stood
with
drooped
heads
and
hanging
ears
dozing
and
motionless
the
men
too
were
wearied
some
of
them
quite
worn
out
a
few
kept
their
feet
bridle
in
hand
under
shelter
of
the
impending
cliff
the
others
having
staggered
down
with
their
backs
against
the
rock
had
almost
instantly
fallen
asleep
for
me
was
neither
sleep
nor
rest
i
did
not
even
seek
protection
against
the
storm
but
standing
clear
of
the
cliff
received
the
drenching
shower
full
upon
my
shoulders
it
was
the
chill
rain
of
the
norther
but
at
that
moment
neither
cold
nor
hot
sirocco
could
have
produced
upon
me
an
impression
of
pain
to
physical
suffering
i
was
insensible
i
should
even
have
welcomed
it
for
i
well
understood
the
truth
proverbially
expressed
in
that
language
rich
above
all
others
in
proverbial
lore
clavo
saca
otro
and
still
more
fully
illustrated
by
the
poet
me
hacen
triste
tristezas
salgo
a
buscar
a
ver
si
con

tristezas
puedo
yes
under
any
other
form
i
should
have
welcomed
physical
pain
as
a
neutraliser
of
my
mental
anguish
but
that
cold
norther
brought
no
consolation
sadly
the
reverse
it
was
the
harbinger
of
keen
apprehension
for
not
only
had
it
interrupted
our
search
but
should
the
heavy
rain
continue
only
for
a
few
hours
we
might
be
able
neither
to
find
or
further
to
follow
the
trail
it
would
be
obliterated
lost
can
you
wonder
that
in
my
heart
i
execrated
those
black
clouds
and
that
driving
deluge
that
with
my
lips
i
cursed
the
sky
and
the
storm
the
moon
and
the
stars
the
red
lightning
and
the
rolling
thunder
my
anathema
ended
i
stood
in
sullen
silence
leaning
against
the
body
of
my
brave
horse
whose
sides
shivered
under
the
chilly
rain
though
i
felt
not
its
chill
absorbed
in
gloomy
thought
i
recked
not
what
was
passing
around
me
and
for
an
unnoted
period
i
remained
in
this
speechless
abstraction
my
reverie
was
broken
some
expressions
that
reached
my
ear
told
me
that
at
least
two
of
my
followers
had
not
yet
yielded
to
weariness
or
despair
two
of
them
were
in
conversation
and
i
easily
recognised
the
voices
of
the
trappers
tireless
used
to
stern
struggles
to
constant
warfare
with
the
elements
with
nature
herself
these
true
men
never
thought
of
giving
up
until
the
last
effort
of
human
ingenuity
had
failed
from
their
conversation
i
gathered
that
they
had
not
yet
lost
hope
of
finding
the
trail
but
were
meditating
on
some
plan
for
recovering
and
following
it
with
renewed
eagerness
i
faced
towards
them
and
listened
both
talked
in
a
low
voice
garey

speaking
as
i
turned
to
them

into

remained

we

there
was
a
little
pique
in
the
trapper
tone
the
breach
that
the
ranger
had
made
while
acting
as
a
faithful
sentinel
was
not
yet
healed
garey
made
no
further
attempts
to
arouse
the
sleeper
but
in
obedience
to
the
order
of
his
comrade
lifted
off
the
hat
and
having
procured
one
of
the
great
candles
he
and
rube
started
off
without
saying
another
word
of
giving
any
clue
to
their
design
though
joyed
at
what
i
had
heard
i
refrained
from
interrogating
them
some
of
my
followers
who
put
questions
received
only
ambiguous
answers
from
the
manner
of
the
trappers
i
saw
that
they
wished
to
be
left
to
themselves
and
i
could
well
trust
them
to
the
development
of
whatever
design
they
had
conceived
on
leaving
us
they
walked
straight
out
from
the
cliff
but
how
far
they
continued
in
this
direction
it
was
impossible
to
tell
they
had
not
lighted
the
candle
and
after
going
steps
their
forms
disappeared
from
our
view
amidst
the
darkness
and
rain
chapter
sixty
one
the
trail
recovered
the
rangers
after
a
moment
of
speculation
as
to
the
designs
of
the
trappers
resumed
their
attitude
of
repose
fatigued
as
they
were
even
the
cold
could
not
keep
them
awake
after
a
pause
the
voice
of
quackenboss
could
be
heard
in
proof
that
that
heavy
sleeper
was
at
length
aroused
the
rain
falling
upon
his
skull
had
been
more
effective
than
the
shouts
and
shaking
of
garey
hillo
where
my
hat
inquired
he
in
a
mystified
tone
at
the
same
time
stirring
himself
and
groping
about
among
the
rocks
where
my
hat
boys
did
any
o
ye
see
anything

his
shouts
again
awoke

sleepers

what
lige
old
fellow
you
lost
your
hat
while
you
were
a
ridin
the
mustang
just
now
the
hoss
kicked
it
off
o
your
head
a
chorus
of
laughter
followed
this
sally
in
the
midst
of
which
quackenboss
could
be
heard
apostrophising
both
his
hat
and
his
comrades
in
no
very
respectful
terms
while
he
commenced
scrambling
over
the
ground
in
vain
search
after
the
lost
sombrero
amidst
the
jokes
and
laughter
uttered
at
his
expense
to
this
merriment
of
my
followers
i
gave
but
little
heed
my
thoughts
were
intent
on
other
things
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
that
bright
spot
in
the
sky
that
had
been
pointed
out
by
rube
and
my
heart
gladdened
as
i
perceived
that
it
was
every
moment
growing
brighter
and
bigger
the
rain
still
fell
thick
and
fast
but
the
edge
of
the
was
slowly
rising
above
the
eastern
horizon
as
though
drawn
up
by
some
invisible
hand
should
the
movement
continue
i
felt
confident
that
in
a
few
minutes
as
rube
had
predicted
the
sky
would
be
clear
again
and
the
moon
shining
brightly
as
ever
these
were
joyous
anticipations
at
intervals
i
glanced
towards
the
prairie
and
listened
to
catch
some
sound
either
the
voices
of
the
trappers
or
the
tread
of
their
returning
footsteps
no
such
sounds
could
be
heard
i
was
becoming
impatient
when
i
perceived
a
sudden
waif
of
light
far
out
upon
the
plain
it
seemed
to
be
again
extinguished
but
in
the
same
place
and
the
moment
after
appeared
a
small
steady
flame
twinkling
like
a
solitary
star
through
the
bluish
mist
of
the
rain
for
a
few
seconds
it
remained
fixed
and
then
commenced
moving
as
if
carried
low
down
along
the
surface
of
the
ground
there
was
nothing
mysterious
about
this
lone
light
to
quackenboss
only
it
remained
an
unexplained
apparition
and
he
might
have
mistaken
it
for
the
the
others
had
been
awake
when
rube
and
garey
took
their
departure
and
easily
recognised
the
lighted
candle
in
the
hands
of
the
trappers
for
some
time
the
light
appeared
to
move
backwards
and
forwards
turning
at
short
distances
as
if
borne
in
irregular
circles
or
in
lines
we
could
perceive
the
sheen
of
water
between
us
and
the
flame
as
though
there
was
a
pond
or
perhaps
a
portion
of
the
prairie
flooded
by
the
rain
after
a
while
the
light
became
fixed
and
a
sharp
exclamation
was
heard
across
the
plain
which
all
of
us
recognised
as
being
in
the
voice
of
the
trapper
rube
again
the
light
was
in
motion
now
flitting
along
more
rapidly
and
as
if
carried
in
a
straight
line
over
the
prairie
we
followed
it
with
eager
eyes
we
saw
it
was
moving
further
and
further
away
and
my
companions
hazarded
the
conjecture
that
the
trappers
had
recovered
the
trail
this
was
soon
verified
by
one
of
themselves
garey
whose
huge
form
looming
through
the
mist
was
seen
approaching
the
spot
and
though
the
expression
of
his
face
could
not
be
noted
in
the
darkness
his
bearing
betokened
that
he
brought
cheerful
tidings
rube
struck
the
trail
said
he
in
a
quiet
voice
as
he
came
up
yonder
he
goes
whar
you
see
the
bleeze
o
the
cannel
he
soon
be
out
o
sight
if
we
do
make
haste
an
follow
without
another
word
we
seized
the
reins
sprang
once
more
into
our
saddles
and
rode
off
after
the
twinkling
star
that
beaconed
us
across
the
plain
rube
was
soon
overtaken
and
we
perceived
that
despite
the
storm
he
was
rapidly
progressing
along
the
trail
his
candle
sheltered
from
the
rain
under
the
ample
sombrero
in
answer
to
numerous
queries
the
old
trapper
vouchsafed
only
an
occasional
wagh
evidently
proud
of
this
new
exhibition
of
his
skill
with
garey
the
curious
succeeded
better
and
as
we
continued
on
the
latter
explained
to
them
how
the
trail
had
been
recovered
by
his
comrade
for
to
rube
it
appeared
was
the
credit
due
rube
remembered
the
mesa
spring
it
was
the
water
in
its
branch
that
we
had
seen
gleaming
under
the
light
the
thoughtful
trapper
conjectured
and
rightly
as
it
proved
that
the
steed
would
stop
there
to
drink
he
had
passed
along
the
stony
shingle
by
the
mound
simply
because
around
the
cliff
lay
his
nearest
way
to
the
water
and
had
followed
a
dry
ridge
that
led
directly
from
the
mesa
to
the
along
this
ridge
going
gently
at
the
time
his
hoof
had
left
no
marks
at
least
none
that
could
be
distinguished
by
and
this
was
why
the
trail
had
been
for
the
moment
lost
rube
however
remembered
that
around
the
spring
there
was
a
tract
of
soft
boggy
ground
and
he
anticipated
that
in
this
the
would
leave
a
deep
impression
to
find
them
he
needed
only
a
kiver
for
the
candle
and
the
huge
hat
of
quackenboss
served
the
purpose
well
an
umbrella
would
scarcely
have
been
better
as
the
trappers
had
conjectured
they
found
the
tracks
in
the
muddy
margin
of
the
the
steed
had
drunk
at
the
pool
but
immediately
after
had
resumed
his
wild
flight
going
westward
from
the
mound
why
had
he
gone
off
at
a
gallop
had
he
been
alarmed
by
aught
or
had
he
taken
fresh
affright
at
the
strange
rider
upon
his
back
i
questioned
garey
i
saw
that
he
knew
why
he
needed
pressing
for
the
answer
he
gave
it
at
length
but
with
evident
reluctance
these
were
his
words
of
explanation
thar
are
on
the
trail
chapter
sixty
two
wolves
on
the
track
the
wolves
then
were
after
him
the
trackers
had
made
out
their
footprints
in
the
mud
of
the
arroyo
both
kinds
had
been
there
the
large
brown
wolf
of
texas
and
the
small
barking
of
the
plains
a
full
pack
there
had
been
as
the
trappers
could
tell
by
the
numerous
tracks
and
that
they
were
following
the
horse
the
tracks
also
testified
to
these
men
of
strange
intelligence
how
knew
they
this
by
what
sign
to
my
inquiries
i
obtained
answer
from
garey
above
the
extended
a
shelving
bank
up
this
the
steed
had
bounded
after
drinking
at
the
pool
up
this
too
the
wolves
had
sprung
after
they
had
left
the
indentation
of
their
claws
in
the
soft
loam
how
knew
garey
that
they
were
in
pursuit
of
the
horse
the
scratches
told
him
they
were
going
at
their
fastest
and
they
would
not
have
sprung
so
far
had
they
not
been
pursuing
some
prey
there
were
footmarks
of
no
other
animal
except
theirs
and
the
of
that
steed
and
that
they
were
after
him
was
evident
to
the
trapper
because
tracks
of
the
wolves
covered
those
of
the
garey
had
no
more
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
his
reasoning
than
a
geometrician
of
the
truth
of
a
theorem
in
euclid
i
groaned
in
spirit
as
i
was
forced
to
adopt
his
conclusion
but
it
was
all
probable
too
probable
had
the
steed
been
alone
unembarrassed
free
it
was
not
likely
the
wolves
would
have
chased
him
thus
the
in
his
prime
is
rarely
the
object
of
their
attack
though
the
old
and
infirm
the
gravid
mare
and
the
feeble
colt
often
fall
before
these
hungry
hunters
of
the
plains
both
common
wolf
and
coyote
possess
all
the
astuteness
of
the
fox
and
know
as
if
by
instinct
the
animal
that
is
wounded
to
death
they
will
follow
the
stricken
deer
that
has
escaped
from
the
hunter
but
if
it
prove
to
be
but
slightly
harmed
instinctively
they
abandon
the
chase
their
instinct
had
told
them
that
the
steed
was
not
ridden
by
a
free
hand
they
had
seen
that
there
was
and
in
the
hope
of
running
down
both
horse
and
rider
they
had
followed
with
hungry
howl
another
fact
lent
probability
to
this
painful
conjecture
we
knew
that
by
the
mesa
were
many
wolves
the
spring
was
the
constant
resort
of
ruminant
animals
deer
and
antelopes
the
cattle
of
the
drank
there
and
the
tottering
calf
oft
became
the
prey
of
the
coyote
and
his
more
powerful
congener
the
gaunt
texan
wolf
there
was
still
another
reason
why
the
place
must
of
late
have
been
the
favourite
prowl
of
these
hideous
brutes
the
of
our
skirmish
had
furnished
them
with
many
a
midnight
banquet
they
had
ravened
upon
the
blood
of
men
and
the
flesh
of
horses
and
they
hungered
for
more
that
they
might
succeed
in
running
down
the
steed
cumbered
as
he
was
was
probable
enough
sooner
or
later
they
would
overtake
him
it
might
be
after
a
long
long
gallop
over
hill
and
dale
through
swamp
and
chapparal
but
still
it
was
probable
those
tough
tireless
pursuers
would
overtake
him
they
would
launch
themselves
upon
his
flanks
they
would
seize
upon
his
wearied
limbs
upon
hers
the
helpless
victim
on
his
back
both
horse
and
rider
would
be
dragged
to
the
earth
both
torn
parted
in
pieces
devoured
i
groaned
under
the
horrid
apprehension
look
thar
said
garey
pointing
to
the
ground
and
holding
his
torch
so
as
to
illuminate
the
surface
the
hoss
has
made
a
slip
thar
see
hyar
the
track
o
the
big
wolf
he
hes
sprung
up
jest
hyar
i
can
tell
by
the
scratch
o
his
i
examined
the
sign
even
to
my
eyes
it
was
readable
and
just
as
garey
had
interpreted
it
there
were
other
tracks
of
wolves
on
the
damp
soil
but
one
had
certainly
launched
himself
forward
in
a
long
leap
as
though
in
an
effort
to
fasten
himself
upon
the
flanks
of
some
animal
the
plainly
showed
that
the
steed
had
slipped
as
he
sprang
over
the
wet
grass
and
this
had
tempted
the
spring
of
the
watchful
pursuer
we
hurried
on
our
excited
feelings
hindered
us
from
causing
longer
than
a
moment
both
rangers
and
trappers
snared
my
eagerness
as
well
as
my
apprehensions
fast
as
the
torches
could
be
carried
we
hurried
on
shortly
after
parting
from
the
mesa
there
occurred
a
change
in
our
favour
the
lights
had
been
carried
under
hats
to
protect
them
from
the
rain
this
precaution
was
no
longer
required
the
storm
had
passed
the
shower
ceasing
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
on
the
clouds
were
fast
driving
from
the
face
of
the
firmament
in
five
minutes
more
the
moon
would
shine
forth
already
her
refracted
rays
lightened
the
prairie
we
did
not
stay
for
her
full
beam
time
was
too
precious
still
trusting
to
the
torches
we
hurried
on
the
beautiful
queen
of
the
night
kept
her
promise
in
five
minutes
her
cheering
orb
shot
out
beyond
the
margin
of
the
dark
pall
that
had
hitherto
shrouded
it
and
her
white
disc
as
if
purified
by
the
storm
shone
with
unwonted
brightness
the
ground
became
conspicuous
almost
as
in
day
the
torches
were
extinguished
and
we
followed
the
trail
more
rapidly
by
the
light
of
the
moon
here
still
in
full
gallop
had
passed
the
and
for
miles
beyond
still
had
he
gone
at
utmost
speed
still
close
upon
his
heels
had
followed
the
ravenous
and
untiring
wolves
here
and
there
were
the
prints
of
their
clawed
feet
the
signs
of
their
unflagging
pursuit
the
roar
of
water
sounded
in
our
ears
it
came
from
the
direction
towards
which
the
trail
was
conducting
us
a
stream
was
not
far
distant
we
soon
diminished
the
distance
a
glassy
sheet
glistened
under
the
moonlight
and
towards
this
the
trail
trended
in
a
straight
line
it
was
a
river
a
cataract
was
near
down
which
the
water
freshened
by
the
late
rain
came
tumbling
broken
by
the
rocks
into
hummocks
of
white
foam
under
the
moonlight
it
appeared
like
an
avalanche
of
snow
the
trappers
recognised
an
affluent
of
the
rio
bravo
running
from
the
north
from
the
high
steppe
of
the
llano
estacado
we
hurried
forward
to
its
bank
and
opposite
the
frothing
rapids
the
trail
conducted
us
to
this
point
to
the
very
edge
of
the
foaming
water
it
led
no
farther
there
were
the
forward
to
the
brink
but
not
back
the
horse
had
plunged
into
the
torrent
chapter
sixty
three
across
the
torrent
surely
was
it
so
into
that
seething
rapid
the
steed
had
launched
himself
where
the
spume
was
whitest
and
the
rocks
gave
out
their
hoarsest
echoes
the
four
close
together
upon
the
bank
showed
the
point
from
which
he
had
sprung
and
the
deeply
indented
turf
testified
that
he
had
made
no
timid
leap
the
pursuers
had
been
close
upon
his
heels
and
he
had
flung
himself
with
desperate
plunge
upon
the
water
had
he
succeeded
in
crossing
it
was
our
first
thought
it
appeared
improbable
impossible
notwithstanding
its
surface
the
current
was
swift
and
looked
as
though
it
would
sweep
either
man
or
horse
from
his
footing
surely
it
was
too
deep
to
be
forded
though
here
and
there
rocks
were
seen
above
the
surface
they
were
but
the
crests
of
large
boulders
and
between
them
the
impetuous
wave
ran
dark
and
rapid
had
the
horse
lost
footing
had
he
been
forced
to
swim
if
so
he
must
have
been
carried
down
by
the
current
his
body
submerged
his
withers
sunk
below
the
surface
his
helpless
rider
the
conclusion
was
evident
to
all
of
us
all
felt
the
conviction
simultaneously
no
not
all
there
came
a
word
of
comfort
from
the
oldest
and
wisest
a
word
that
gave
cheer

my
drooping

we
bent
down
to

ground
sure
enough
it
was
covered
with
the
tracks
of
wolves
a
numerous
band
had
crowded
together
on
the
spot
and
as
the
prints
of
their
feet
pointed
in
all
directions
it
was
evident
they
had
not
gone
forward
but
brought
to
a
stand
by
the
torrent
had
given
up
the
chase
and
scattered
away
pray
heaven
it
was
no
mere
conjecture
with
rube
it
was
a
belief
and
as
i
had
grown
to
put
implicit
reliance
in
the
old
trapper
i
felt
reassured
rube
opinions
both
as
to
the
steed
having
safely
crossed
and
the
discomfiture
of
the
wolves
were
shared
by
the
rest
of
my
followers
not
one
of
whom
was
a
mean
authority
on
such
a
subject
garey
second
only
to
his
older
comrade
in
the
working
out
of
a
prairie
syllogism
gave
rube
statement
his
emphatic
confirmation
the
steed
was
yet
safe
and
pray
heaven
the
rider
with
lighter
heart
i
sprang
back
into
the
saddle
my
followers
imitated
the
example
and
with
eyes
scanning
the
stream
we
rode
along
the
bank
to
seek
for
a
crossing
there
was
no
ford
near
the
spot
perhaps
where
the
steed
had
passed
over
the
stream
might
have
been
waded
at
but
now
during
the
freshet
the
current
would
have
swept
off
horse
and
man
like
so
much
the
rocks
the
black
waves
that
rushed
between
them
the
boiling
frothing
eddies
discouraged
any
attempt
at
crossing
there
we
all
saw
that
it
was
impracticable
some
rode
up
stream
others
went
in
the
opposite
direction
both
parties
met
again
with
blank
looks
neither
had
found
a
crossing
there
was
no
time
to
search
further
at
least
my
impatience
would
no
longer
brook
delay
it
was
not
the
first
time
for
both
my
horse
and
myself
to
cross
a
river
without
ford
nor
was
it
the
first
time
for
many
of
my
followers
below
the
rapids
the
current
ran
slow
apparently
ceasing
altogether
the
water
was
still
though
wider
from
bank
to
bank
a
hundred
yards
or
more
by
the
aid
of
the
moonlight
i
could
tell
that
the
bank
on
the
opposite
side
was
low
and
shelving
it
could
be
easily
climbed
by
a
horse
i
stayed
to
reason
no
further
many
a
hundred
yards
had
moro
swum
with
his
rider
on
his
back
many
a
current
had
he
cleft
with
his
proud
breast
far
more
rapid
than
that
i
headed
him
to
the
bank
gave
him
the
spur
and
went
plunging
into
the
flood
plunge
plunge
plunge
i
heard
behind
me
till
the
last
of
my
followers
had
launched
themselves
on
the
wave
and
were
swimming
silently
over
one
after
another
we
reached
the
opposite
side
and
ascended
the
bank
hurriedly
i
counted
our
number
as
the
men
rode
out
one
had
not
yet
arrived
who
was
missing
rube
answered
some
one
i
glanced
back
but
without
feeling
any
uneasiness
i
had
no
fear
for
the
trapper
garey
alleged
he
was
safe
to
turn
up
something
had
detained
him
could
his
old
mare
swim
like
a
mink
replied
garey
but
rube
wo
ride
her
across
afeerd
to
sink
her
too
deep
in
the
water

of

faces
were
observed
rippling
the
wave
one
directly
in
the
wake
of
the
other
the
foremost
was
the
grizzled
front
of
the
old
mustang
the
other
the
unmistakeable
physiognomy
of
her
master
the
moonlight
shining
upon
both
rendered
them
conspicuous
above
the
dark
brown
water
and
the
spectacle
drew
a
laugh
from
those
who
had
reached
the
bank
rube
mode
of
crossing
was
unique
like
every
action
of
this
singular
man
perhaps
he
adopted
it
from
sheer
eccentricity
or
maybe
in
order
that
his
mustang
might
swim
more
freely
he
had
ridden
gently
into
the
water
and
kept
his
saddle
till
the
mare
was
beyond
her
depth
then
sliding
backward
over
her
hips
he
took
the
tail
in
his
teeth
and
partly
towed
like
a
fish
upon
the
hook
and
partly
striking
to
assist
in
the
passage
he
swam
after
as
soon
as
the
mare
again
touched
bottom
he
drew
himself
up
over
the
croup
and
in
this
way
regained
his
saddle
mare
and
man
as
they
climbed
out
on
the
bank
the
thin
skeleton
bodies
of
both
reduced
to
their
slenderest
dimensions
by
the
soaking
water
presented
a
spectacle
so
ludicrous
as
to
elicit
a
fresh
chorus
of
laughter
from
his
comrades
i
stayed
not
till
its
echoes
had
died
away
but
pressing
my
steed
along
the
bank
soon
arrived
at
the
rapids
where
i
expected
to
recover
the
trail
to
my
joy
were
there
directly
opposite
the
point
where
the
steed
had
taken
to
the
stream
rube
was
right
he
had
waded
safely
across
thank
heaven
at
least
from
that
peril
has
she
been
saved
chapter
sixty
four
a
lilliputian
forest
on
resuming
the
trail
i
was
cheered
by
three
considerations
the
peril
of
the
flood
was
past
she
was
not
drowned
the
wolves
were
thrown
off
the
dangerous
rapid
had
deterred
them
on
the
other
side
their
footprints
were
no
longer
found
thirdly
the
steed
had
slackened
his
pace
after
climbing
the
bank
he
had
set
off
in
a
rapid
gait
but
not
at
a
gallop
he
been
pacin
hyar
remarked
garey
as
soon
as
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
tracks
pacing
i
knew
what
was
meant
by
this
i
knew
that
gait
peculiar
to
the
prairie
horse
fast
but
smooth
as
the
amble
of
a
palfrey
his
rider
would
scarcely
perceive
the
gentle
movement
her
torture
would
be
less
perhaps
too
no
longer
frighted
by
the
fierce
pursuers
the
horse
would
come
to
a
stop
his
wearied
limbs
would
admonish
him
and
then
surely
he
could
not
have
gone
much
farther
we
too
were
wearied
one
and
all
but
these
pleasing
conjectures
beguiled
us
from
thinking
of
our
toil
and
we
advanced
more
hopefully
along
the
trail
alas
it
was
my
fate
to
be
the
victim
of
alternate
hopes
and
fears
my
joy
was
and
fast
fleeted
away
we
had
gone
but
a
few
hundred
paces
from
the
river
when
we
encountered
an
obstacle
that
proved
not
only
a
serious
barrier
to
our
progress
but
almost
brought
our
tracking
to
a
termination
this
obstacle
was
a
forest
of
oaks
not
oaks
as
these
famed
trees
are
usually
designated
but
the
very
reverse
a
forest
of
oaks
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
extended
this
singular
wood
in
which
no
tree
rose
above
thirty
inches
in
height
yet
was
it
no
thicket
no
of
shrubs
but
a
true
forest
of
oaks
each
tree
having
its
separate
stem
its
boughs
its
lobed
leaves
and
its
bunches
of
brown
acorns
shin
oak
cried
the
trappers
as
we
entered
the
verge
of
this
miniature
forest
wagh
exclaimed
rube
in
a
tone
of
impatience
hyur
bother
may
all
get
out
o
yur
saddles
an
rest
yur
critturs
we
hev
to
crawl
hyur
and
so
it
resulted
for
long
weary
hours
we
followed
the
trail
going
not
faster
than
we
could
have
crawled
upon
our
hands
and
knees
the
tracks
of
the
steed
were
plain
enough
and
in
daylight
could
have
been
easily
followed
but
the
little
oaks
grew
close
and
regular
as
if
planted
by
the
hand
of
man
and
through
their
thick
foliage
the
moonlight
scarcely
penetrated
their
boughs
almost
touched
each
other
so
that
the
whole
surface
lay
in
dark
shadow
rendering
it
almost
impossible
to
make
out
the
here
and
there
a
broken
branch
or
a
bunch
of
tossed
leaves
their
shining
glaucous
in
the
moonlight
enabled
us
to
advance
at
a
quicker
rate
but
as
the
horse
had
passed
gently
over
the
ground
these
signs
were
few
and
far
between
for
long
fretful
hours
we
toiled
through
the
forest
our
heads
far
overtopping
its
tallest
trees
we
might
have
fancied
that
we
were
threading
our
way
through
some
extended
nursery
the
trail
led
directly
across
its
central
part
and
ere
we
had
reached
its
furthest
verge
the
moon
rays
were
mingling
with
the
purple
light
of
morning
soon
after
the
forest
opened
the
little
dwarfs
grew
further
apart
here
scattered
thinly
over
the
ground
there
disposed
in
clumps
or
miniature
grove
until
at
length
the
sward
of
the
prairie
predominated
the
trouble
of
the
trackers
was
at
an
end
the
welcome
light
of
the
sun
was
thrown
upon
the
trail
so
that
they
could
lift
it
as
fast
as
we
could
ride
and
no
longer
hindered
by
brake
or
bush
we
advanced
at
a
rapid
rate
across
the
prairie
over
this
ground
the
steed
had
also
passed
rapidly
he
had
continued
to
pace
for
some
distance
after
emerging
from
the
forest
but
all
at
once
as
we
could
tell
by
his
tracks
he
had
bounded
off
again
and
resumed
his
headlong
gallop
what
had
started
him
afresh
we
were
at
a
loss
to
imagine
even
the
were
puzzled
had
wolves
again
attacked
him
or
some
other
enemy
no
nor
one
nor
other
it
was
a
green
prairie
over
which
he
had
gone
a
smooth
sward
of
but
there
were
spots
where
the
growth
was
thin
patches
nearly
bare
and
these
were
softened
by
the
rain
even
the
light
paw
of
a
wolf
would
have
impressed
itself
in
such
places
sufficiently
to
be
detected
by
the
men
of
the
plains
the
horse
had
passed
since
the
rain
had
ceased
falling
no
wolf
or
other
animal
had
been
after
him
perhaps
he
had
taken
a
start
of
himself
freshly
affrighted
at
the
novel
mode
in
which
he
was
ridden
still
under
excitement
from
the
rough
usage
he
had
received
and
from
which
he
had
not
yet
cooled
down
perhaps
the
barbed
points
of
the
cohetes
rankled
in
his
flesh
acting
like
spurs
perhaps
some
distant
sound
had
led
him
to
fancy
the
hooting
mob
or
the
howling
wolves
still
coming
at
his
heels
perhaps
an
exclamation
from
the
trackers
who
were
riding
in
the
advance
put
an
end
to
these
conjectures
both
had
pulled
up
and
were
pointing
to
the
ground
no
words
were
spoken
none
needed
we
all
read
with
our
eyes
an
explanation
of
the
renewed
gallop
directly
in
front
of
us
the
sward
was
cut
and
scored
by
numerous
tracks
not
four
but
four
hundred
were
indented
in
the
turf
all
of
them
fresh
as
the
trail
we
were
following
and
amidst
these
the
tracks
of
the
steed
becoming
intermingled
were
lost
to
our
view
a
drove
of
wild
horses
pronounced
the
guides
at
a
glance
they
were
the
tracks
of
unshod
hoofs
though
that
would
scarcely
have
proved
them
wild
an
indian
troop
might
have
ridden
past
without
leaving
any
other
sign
but
these
horses
had
not
been
mounted
as
the
trappers
confidently
alleged
and
among
them
were
the
of
foals
and
colts
which
proved
the
drove
to
be
a
of
mustangs
at
the
point
where
we
first
struck
their
tracks
they
had
been
going
in
full
speed
and
the
trail
of
the
steed
converged
until
it
closed
with
theirs
at
an
acute
angle

in

involuntarily
i
raised
my
eyes
fancying
from
these
words
that
the
horses
were
in
sight
but
no
the
speaker
was
riding
forward
leaning
over
in
his
saddle
with
looks
fixed
upon
the
ground
all
that
he
had
spoken
he
had
been
reading
from
the
surface
of
the
prairie
from
hieroglyphics
to
me
unintelligible
but
to
him
more
easily
interpreted
than
a
page
of
the
printed
book
i
knew
that
what
he
was
saying
was
true
the
steed
had
galloped
after
a
drove
of
wild
horses
he
had
overtaken
them
and
at
the
point
where
we
now
were
had
been
passing
along
in
their
midst
dark
thoughts
came
crowding
into
my
mind
at
this
discovery
another
shadow
across
my
heart
i
perceived
at
once
a
new
situation
of
peril
for
my
betrothed
new
and
strange
and
awful
i
saw
her
in
the
midst
of
a
troop
of
neighing
stallions
with
fiery
eyes
and
red
steaming
nostrils
these
perhaps
angry
at
the
white
steed
and
jealous
of
his
approach
to
the
in
mad
rage
rushing
upon
him
with
open
mouth
and
yellow
glistening
teeth
rearing
around
and
above
him
and
striking
down
with
deadly
desperate
hoof
oh
it
was
a
horrid
apprehension
a
fearful
fancy
yet
fearful
as
it
was
it
proved
to
be
the
exact
shadow
of
a
reality
as
the
mirage
refracts
distant
objects
upon
the
retina
of
the
eye
so
some
spiritual
mirage
must
have
thrown
upon
my
mind
the
image
of
things
that
were
real
not
distant
though
then
unseen
not
distant
was
the
real
rapidly
i
ascended
another
swell
of
the
prairie
and
from
its
crest
beheld
almost
the
counterpart
of
the
terrible
scene
that
my
imagination
had
conjured
up
was
it
a
dream
was
it
still
fancy
that
was
cheating
my
eyes
no
there
was
the
drove
there
the
rearing
screaming
stallions
there
the
white
steed
in
their
midst
he
too
rearing
erect
there
upon
his
back
o
god
look
down
in
mercy
save
her
save
her
chapter
sixty
five
scattering
the
wild
stallions
such
rude
appeal
was
wrung
from
my
lips
by
the
dread
spectacle
on
which
my
eyes
rested
i
scarcely
waited
the
echo
of
my
words
i
waited
not
the
counsel
of
my
comrades
but
plunging
deeply
the
spur
galloped
down
the
hill
in
the
direction
of
the
drove
there
was
no
method
observed
no
attempt
to
keep
under
cover
there
was
no
time
either
for
caution
or
concealment
i
acted
under
instantaneous
impulse
and
with
but
one
thought
to
charge
forward
scatter
the
stallions
and
if
yet
in
time
save
her
from
those
hurling
heels
and
fierce
glittering
teeth
yet
in
ay
such
provisory
parenthesis
was
in
my
mind
at
the
moment
but
i
drew
hope
from
observing
that
the
steed
kept
a
ring
cleared
around
him
his
assailants
only
threatened
at
a
distance
had
he
been
alone
i
might
have
acted
with
more
caution
and
perhaps
have
thought
of
some
stratagem
to
capture
him
as
it
was
stratagem
was
out
of
the
question
the
circumstances
required
speed
both
trappers
and
rangers
acting
under
like
impulse
with
myself
had
spurred
their
horses
into
a
gallop
and
followed
close
at
my
heels
the
drove
was
yet
distant
the
wind
blew
from
them
a
brisk
breeze
we
were
down
the
hill
and
still
the
wild
horses
neither
heard
saw
nor
scented
us
i
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
i
wished
to
startle
and
put
them
to
flight
my
followers
shouted
in
chorus
but
our
voices
reached
not
the
quarrelling
caballada
a
better
expedient
suggested
itself
i
drew
my
pistol
from
its
holster
and
fired
several
shots
in
the
air
the
first
would
have
been
sufficient
its
report
was
heard
despite
the
opposing
wind
and
the
mustangs
affrighted
by
the
sound
suddenly
forsook
the
encounter
some
bounded
away
at
once
others
came
wheeling
around
us
snorting
fiercely
and
tossing
their
heads
in
the
air
a
few
galloped
almost
within
range
of
our
rifles
and
then
uttering
their
shrill
neighing
turned
and
broke
off
in
rapid
flight
the
steed
and
his
rider
alone
remained
where
we
had
first
observed
them
for
some
moments
he
kept
the
ground
as
if
bewildered
by
the
sudden
scattering
of
his
assailants
but
he
too
must
have
heard
the
shots
and
perhaps
alone
divined
something
of
what
had
caused
those
singular
noises
in
the
loud
concussion
he
recognised
the
voice
of
his
greatest
enemy
and
yet
he
stirred
not
from
the
spot
was
he
going
to
await
our
approach
had
he
become
tamed
reconciled
to
captivity
or
was
it
that
we
had
rescued
him
from
his
angry
rivals
that
he
was
grateful
and
no
longer
feared
us
such
odd
ideas
rushed
rapidly
through
my
mind
as
i
hurried
forward
i
had
begun
to
deem
it
probable
that
he
would
stay
our
approach
and
suffer
us
quietly
to
recapture
him
alas
i
was
soon
undeceived
i
was
still
a
long
way
off
many
hundred
yards
when
i
saw
him
rear
upward
wheel
round
upon
his
as
on
a
pivot
and
then
bound
off
in
determined
flight
his
shrill
scream
pealing
back
upon
the
breeze
fell
upon
my
ears
like
the
taunt
of
some
deadly
foe
it
seemed
the
utterance
of
mockery
and
revenge
mockery
at
the
impotence
of
my
pursuit
revenge
that
i
had
once
made
him
my
captive
i
obeyed
the
only
impulse
i
could
have
at
such
a
moment
and
galloped
after
as
fast
as
my
horse
could
go
i
stayed
for
no
consultation
with
my
companions
i
had
already
forged
far
ahead
of
them
they
were
too
distant
for
speech
i
needed
not
their
wisdom
to
guide
me
no
plan
required
conception
or
deliberation
the
course
was
clear
by
speed
alone
could
the
horse
be
taken
and
his
rider
saved
from
destruction
yet
oh
the
fearfulness
of
this
last
reflection
the
agony
of
the
doubt
it
was
not
the
hour
to
indulge
in
idle
anguish
i
repressed
the
emotion
and
bent
myself
earnestly
upon
the
pursuit
i
spoke
to
my
brave
steed
addressing
him
by
name
i
urged
him
with
hands
and
knees
only
at
intervals
did
i
inflict
the
cruel
steel
upon
his
ribs
i
soon
perceived
that
he
was
flagging
i
perceived
it
with
increased
apprehension
for
the
result
he
had
worn
his
saddle
too
long
on
the
day
before
and
the
wet
weary
night
had
jaded
him
he
had
been
and
i
felt
his
weariness
as
he
galloped
with
feebler
stroke
the
must
have
been
fresh
in
comparison
but
life
and
death
were
upon
the
issue
her
life
perhaps
my
own
i
cared
not
to
survive
her
she
must
be
saved
the
spur
must
be
plied
without
remorse
the
steed
must
be
overtaken
even
if
moro
should
die
it
was
a
rolling
prairie
over
which
the
chase
led
a
surface
that
undulated
like
the
billows
of
the
ocean
we
galloped
transversely
to
the
direction
of
the
swells
that
rose
one
after
the
other
in
rapid
succession
perhaps
the
rapidity
with
which
we
were
crossing
them
brought
them
to
each
other
to
me
there
appeared
no
level
ground
between
these
up
hill
and
down
hill
in
quick
alternation
was
the
manner
of
our
progress
a
severe
trial
upon
the
girths
a
hard
killing
gallop
for
my
poor
horse
but
life
and
death
were
upon
the
issue
and
the
spur
must
be
plied
without
remorse
a
long
cruel
gallop
would
it
never
come
to
an
end
i
would
the
steed
never
tire
would
he
never
stop
surely
in
time
he
must
become
weary
surely
moro
was
his
equal
in
strength
as
in
speed
superior
to
him
in
both
ah
the
prairie
horse
possessed
a
double
advantage
he
had
started
fresh
he
was
on
his
native
ground
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
him
not
for
one
moment
did
i
withdraw
my
glance
a
mysterious
apprehension
was
upon
me
i
feared
to
look
around
lest
he
should
disappear
the
souvenirs
of
the
former
chase
still
haunted
me
weird
remembrances
clung
to
my
spirit
i
was
once
more
in
the
region
of
the
supernatural
i
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
but
straight
before
me
straight
at
the
object
of
my
pursuit
and
the
distance
that
lay
between
us
this
last
i
continuously
scanned
now
with
fresh
hope
and
now
again
with
doubt
it
seemed
to
vary
with
the
ground
at
one
time
i
was
nearer
as
the
descending
slope
gave
me
the
advantage
but
the
moment
after
the
steep
declivity
retarded
the
speed
of
my
horse
and
increased
the
intervening
distance
it
was
with
joy
i
crossed
the
last
swell
of
the
rolling
prairie
and
beheld
a
level
plain
stretching
before
us
it
was
with
joy
i
perceived
that
upon
the
new
ground
i
was
rapidly
gaining
upon
the
steed
and
rapidly
i
continued
to
gain
upon
him
until
scarcely
three
hundred
yards
were
between
us
so
near
was
i
that
i
could
trace
the
outlines
of
form
her
prostrate
limbs
still
lashed
to
the
croup
her
garments
loose
and
torn
her
ankles
her
long
dark
hair
dishevelled
and
trailing
to
the
ground
even
her
pallid
cheek
i
could
perceive
as
at
intervals
the
steed
tossed
back
his
head
to
utter
his
wild
taunting
neigh
o
god
there
was
blood
upon
it
i
was
near
enough
to
be
heard
i
shouted
in
my
loudest
voice
i
called
her
by
name
i
kept
my
eyes
upon
her
and
with
throbbing
anxiety
listened
for
a
response
i
fancied
that
her
head
was
raised
as
though
she
understood
and
would
have
answered
me
i
could
hear
no
voice
but
her
feeble
cry
might
have
been
drowned
by
the
clatter
of
the
hoofs
again
i
called
aloud
again
and
again
pronouncing
her
name
surely
i
heard
a
cry
surely
her
head
was
raised
from
the
withers
of
the
horse
it
was
so
i
could
not
be
mistaken
thank
heaven
she
lives
i
had
scarcely
uttered
the
prayer
when
i
felt
my
steed
yield
beneath
me
as
though
he
was
sinking
into
the
bosom
of
the
earth
i
was
hurled
out
of
the
saddle
and
flung
upon
the
plain
my
horse
had
broken
through
the
burrow
of
the
prairie
marmot
and
the
false
step
had
brought
him
with
violence
to
the
ground
i
was
neither
stunned
nor
entangled
by
the
fall
and
in
a
few
seconds
had
regained
my
feet
my
bridle
and
saddle
but
as
i
headed
my
horse
once
more
toward
the
chase
the
white
steed
and
his
rider
had
passed
out
of
sight
chapter
sixty
six
lost
in
a
chapparal
i
was
chagrined
frantic
and
despairing
but
not
surprised
this
time
there
was
no
mystery
about
the
disappearance
of
the
steed
the
chapparal
explained
it
though
i
no
longer
saw
him
he
was
yet
within
hearing
his
footfall
on
the
firm
ground
the
occasional
snapping
of
a
dead
stick
the
whisk
of
the
recoiling
branches
all
reached
my
ears
as
i
was
remounting
these
sounds
guided
me
and
without
staying
to
follow
his
tracks
i
dashed
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
chapparal
at
the
point
nearest
to
where
i
heard
him
moving
i
did
not
pause
to
look
for
an
opening
but
heading
in
the
direction
whence
came
the
sounds
i
spurred
forward
into
the
thicket
breasting
the
bushes
that
reached
around
his
neck
or
bounding
over
them
my
brave
horse
pressed
on
but
he
had
not
gone
three
lengths
of
himself
before
i
recognised
the
imprudence
of
the
course
i
was
pursuing
i
now
saw
i
should
have
the
i
no
longer
heard
the
movements
of
the
steed
neither
nor
snapping
sticks
nor
breaking
branches
the
noise
made
by
my
own
horse
amid
the
crackling
acacias
drowned
every
other
sound
and
so
long
as
i
kept
in
motion
i
moved
with
uncertainty
it
was
only
when
i
made
stop
that
i
could
again
hear
the
chase
struggling
through
the
thicket
but
now
the
sounds
were
faint
and
far
distant
growing
still
fainter
as
i
listened
once
more
i
urged
forward
my
horse
heading
him
almost
at
random
but
i
had
not
advanced
a
hundred
paces
before
the
misery
of
uncertainty
again
impelled
me
to
halt
this
time
i
listened
and
heard
nothing
not
even
the
recoil
of
a
bough
the
steed
had
either
stopped
and
was
standing
silent
or
what
was
more
probable
had
gained
so
so
far
in
advance
of
me
that
his
was
out
of
hearing
angered
at
myself
too
much
excited
for
cool
reflection
i
lanced
the
sides
of
my
horse
and
galloped
madly
through
the
thicket
i
rode
several
hundred
yards
before
drawing
bridle
in
a
sort
of
desperate
hope
i
might
once
more
bring
myself
within
earshot
of
the
chase
again
i
halted
to
listen
my
recklessness
proved
of
no
avail
not
a
sound
reached
my
ear
even
had
there
been
sounds
i
should
scarcely
have
heard
them
above
that
that
was
issuing
from
the
nostrils
of
my
panting
horse
but
sound
there
was
none
silent
was
the
chapparal
around
me
silent
as
death
not
even
a
bird
moved
among
its
branches
i
felt
something
like
my
imprudence
i
denounced
over
and
over
but
for
my
rash
haste
i
might
yet
have
been
upon
the
trail
perhaps
within
sight
of
the
object
of
pursuit
where
the
steed
had
gone
surely
i
could
have
followed
now
he
was
gone
i
knew
not
whither
lost
his
trail
lost
all
lost
to
recover
the
trace
of
him
i
made
several
casts
across
the
thicket
i
rode
first
in
one
direction
then
in
another
but
all
to
no
purpose
i
could
find
neither
nor
broken
branch
i
next
bethought
me
of
returning
to
the
open
prairie
there
retaking
the
trail
and
following
it
thence
this
was
clearly
the
wisest
in
fact
the
only
course
in
which
there
was
reason
i
should
easily
recover
the
trail
at
the
point
where
the
horse
had
entered
the
chapparal
and
thence
i
might
follow
it
without
difficulty
i
turned
my
horse
round
and
headed
him
in
the
direction
of
the
prairie
or
rather
in
what
i
supposed
to
be
the
direction
for
this
too
had
become
conjecture
it
was
not
till
i
had
ridden
for
a
for
more
than
a
mile
through
glade
and
bush
not
till
i
had
ridden
nearly
twice
as
far
in
the
opposite
direction
and
then
to
right
and
then
to
left
that
i
pulled
up
my
broken
horse
dropped
the
rein
upon
his
withers
and
sat
bent
in
my
saddle
under
the
full
conviction
that
i
too
was
lost
lost
in
the
chapparal
that
parched
and
hideous
jungle
where
every
plant
that
carries
a
thorn
seemed
to
have
place
around
grew
mimosas
gleditschias
robinias
all
the
thorny
legumes
of
the
world
above
towered
the
splendid
with
spinous
stem
there
nourished
the
tornillo
with
its
twisted
beans
there
the
junco
whose
very
leaves
are
thorns
there
saw
i
yuccas
and
clawed
bromelias
and
there
too
the
universal
cactacese
mamillaria
and
even
the
very
grass
was
thorny
for
it
was
a
species
of
the
whose
knotted
culms
are
armed
with
sharp
spurs
through
this
horrid
thicket
i
had
not
passed
unscathed
my
garments
were
already
torn
my
limbs
were
bleeding
limbs
and
hers
of
hers
alone
was
i
thinking
those
members
those
arms
that
smooth
delicate
skin
bosom
and
shoulders
bare
the
thorn
the
scratch
the
tear
oh
it
was
agony
to
think
by
action
alone
might
i
hope
to
still
my
emotions
and
once
more
rousing
myself
from
the
lethargy
of
painful
thought
i
urged
my
steed
onward
through
the
bushes
chapter
sixty
seven
encounter
with
javall
i
had
no
mark
to
guide
me
either
on
the
earth
or
in
the
heavens
i
had
an
indefinite
idea
that
the
chase
had
led
westward
and
therefore
to
get
back
to
the
prairie
i
ought
to
head
towards
the
east
but
how
was
i
to
distinguish
east
from
west
in
the
chapparal
both
were
alike
and
so
too
upon
the
sky
no
sun
was
visible
the
canopy
of
heaven
was
of
a
uniform
leaden
colour
upon
its
face
were
no
signs
by
which
the
cardinal
points
could
have
been
discovered
had
i
been
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
surrounded
by
a
northern
i
could
have
made
out
my
course
the
oak
or
the
elm
the
or
maple
the
beech
or
sycamore
any
of
them
would
have
been
compass
sufficient
for
me
but
in
that
thicket
of
thorny
shrubs
i
was
completely
at
fault
it
was
a
subtropical
flora
or
rather
a
vegetation
of
the
arid
desert
to
which
i
was
almost
a
stranger
i
knew
there
were
men
skilled
in
the
craft
of
the
chapparal
who
in
the
midst
of
it
could
tell
north
from
south
without
compass
or
stars
not
i
could
think
of
no
better
mode
than
to
trust
to
the
guidance
of
my
horse
more
than
once
when
lost
in
the
thick
forest
or
on
the
boundless
plain
had
i
reposed
a
similar
trust
in
his
instincts
more
than
once
had
he
borne
me
out
of
my
bewilderment
but
whither
could
he
take
me
back
to
the
path
by
which
we
had
come
probably
enough
had
that
path
led
to
a
home
but
it
did
not
my
poor
steed
like
myself
had
no
home
he
too
was
a
ranger
for
years
had
been
flitting
from
place
to
place
hundreds
ay
thousands
of
miles
from
each
other
long
had
he
forgotten
his
native
stall
i
surmised
that
if
there
was
water
near
his
instinct
might
carry
him
to
that
and
much
needed
it
both
horse
and
rider
should
we
reach
a
running
stream
it
would
serve
as
a
guide
i
dropped
the
rein
upon
his
neck
and
left
him
to
his
will
i
had
already
shouted
in
my
loudest
voice
in
hopes
of
being
heard
by
my
comrades
by
none
other
than
them
for
what
could
human
being
do
in
such
a
spot
shunned
even
by
the
brute
creation
the
horned
lizard
the
ground
rattlesnake
the
armadillo
and
the
coyote
alone
inhabit
these
dry
jungles
and
now
and
then
the
javali
feeding
upon
the
twisted
legumes
of
the
tornillo
passes
through
their
midst
but
even
these
are
rare
and
the
traveller
may
ride
for
scores
of
miles
through
a
mexican
chapparal
without
encountering
aught
that
lives
and
moves
there
reigns
the
stillness
of
death
unless
the
wind
be
rustling
among
the
pinnate
fronds
of
the
acacias
or
the
unseen
locust
utters
its
harsh
shrieking
amid
the
parched
herbage
the
weary
wayfarer
may
ride
on
cheered
by
no
other
sound
than
his
own
voice
or
the
footfall
of
his
horse
there
was
still
the
chance
that
my
followers
might
hear
me
i
knew
that
they
would
not
stray
from
the
trail
though
they
must
have
been
far
behind
when
i
entered
the
chapparal
following
the
tracks
they
would
in
time
be
sure
to
come
up
it
was
a
question
whether
they
would
follow
mine
or
those
of
the
steed
this
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
and
i
paused
to
consider
it
if
the
former
then
was
i
wrong
in
moving
onward
as
i
should
only
be
going
them
and
leading
them
on
a
longer
search
already
had
i
given
them
a
knot
to
unravel
my
devious
path
forming
a
labyrinthine
maze
it
was
more
than
probable
they
would
follow
in
the
belief
that
i
had
some
reason
for
deviating
from
the
trail
of
the
steed
perhaps
for
the
purpose
of
heading
or
intercepting
him
this
conjecture
decided
me
against
advancing
farther
at
least
until
some
time
should
elapse
enough
for
them
to
get
up
out
of
compassion
for
my
horse
i
dismounted
at
intervals
i
shouted
aloud
and
fired
shots
from
my
pistols
after
each
i
listened
but
neither
shot
nor
shout
reached
me
in
reply
they
must
have
been
distant
indeed
not
to
hear
the
report
of
for
had
they
heard
them
they
would
have
been
certain
to
make
answer
in
a
similar
manner
all
of
them
carried
rifles
and
pistols
i
began
to
think
it
was
full
time
for
them
to
have
reached
me
again
i
fired
several
shots
but
as
before
echo
was
the
only
reply
perhaps
they
had
followed
me
perhaps
they
had
kept
on
upon
the
trail
of
the
steed
and
it
might
be
leading
them
far
away
beyond
hearing
of
the
reports
perhaps
there
was
not
yet
time
for
them
to
have
arrived
while
thus
conjecturing
my
ears
were
assailed
by
the
screeching
of
birds
at
some
distance
off
i
recognised
the
harsh
notes
of
the
jay
mingling
with
the
chatter
of
the
red
cardinal
from
the
tones
i
knew
that
these
birds
were
excited
by
the
presence
of
some
enemy
perhaps
they
were
defending
their
nests
against
the
black
snake
or
the
or
it
might
be
my
followers
approaching
it
might
be
the
steed
like
me
still
wandering
in
the
chapparal
i
sprang
to
my
saddle
to
get
a
better
view
and
gazed
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
guided
by
the
voices
of
the
birds
i
soon
discovered
the
scene
of
the
commotion
at
some
distance
off
i
saw
both
jays
and
cardinals
fluttering
among
the
branches
evidently
busy
with
something
on
the
ground
beneath
them
at
the
same
time
i
heard
strange
noises
far
louder
than
the
voices
of
the
birds
but
could
not
tell
what
was
causing
them
my
spirits
sank
for
i
knew
they
could
not
be
produced
either
by
my
comrades
or
the
steed
it
was
not
far
and
i
determined
to
satisfy
myself
as
to
what
was
causing
such
a
commotion
in
this
hitherto
silent
place
i
rode
towards
the
spot
as
fast
as
my
horse
could
make
way
through
the
bushes
i
was
soon
satisfied
coming
out
on
the
edge
of
a
little
glade
i
became
spectator
to
a
singular
scene
a
battle
between
the
red
cougar
and
a
band
of
javali
the
fierce
little
boars
were
ringing
the
panther
who
was
fighting
desperately
in
their
midst
several
of
them
lay
upon
the
ground
struck
senseless
or
dead
by
the
strong
paws
of
the
huge
cat
but
the
others
nothing
daunted
had
completely
surrounded
their
enemy
and
were
bounding
upon
him
with
open
mouths
and
wounding
him
with
their
sharp
shining
tusks
the
scene
aroused
my
hunter
instincts
and
suddenly
unslinging
my
rifle
i
set
my
eye
to
the
sights
i
had
no
hesitation
about
the
selection
of
my
mark
the
panther
by
all
means
and
drawing
trigger
i
sent
my
bullet
through
the
creature
skull
that
stretched
him
out
in
the
midst
of
his
assailants
three
seconds
had
not
elapsed
before
i
had
reason
to
regret
the
choice
i
had
made
of
a
victim
i
should
have
let
the
cougar
alone
and
either
held
my
fire
or
directed
it
upon
one
of
his
enemies
for
the
moment
he
was
de
his
assailants
became
mine
transferring
their
surround
to
my
horse
and
myself
with
all
the
savage
fierceness
they
had
just
exhibited
towards
the
panther
i
had
no
means
of
punishing
the
ungrateful
brutes
they
had
not
given
me
time
to
reload
my
rifle
before
commencing
their
attack
and
my
pistols
were
both
empty
my
horse
startled
by
the
unexpected
assault
as
well
as
by
the
strange
creatures
that
were
making
it
snorted
and
plunged
wildly
over
the
ground
but
go
where
he
would
a
score
of
the
ferocious
brutes
followed
springing
up
against
his
thighs
and
scoring
his
shanks
with
their
terrible
tusks
well
for
me
i
was
able
to
keep
the
saddle
had
i
been
thrown
from
it
at
that
moment
i
should
certainly
have
been
torn
to
pieces
i
saw
no
hope
of
safety
but
in
flight
and
spurring
my
horse
i
gave
him
full
rein
alas
through
that
tangled
thicket
the
javali
could
go
as
fast
as
he
and
after
advancing
a
hundred
yards
or
so
i
perceived
the
whole
flock
still
around
me
assailing
as
fiercely
as
ever
the
limbs
of
my
steed
the
result
might
have
proved
awkward
enough
but
at
that
moment
i
heard
voices
and
saw
mounted
men
breaking
through
the
underwood
they
were
stanfield
quackenboss
and
the
rest
of
the
rangers
in
another
instant
they
were
on
the
ground
and
their
revolvers
playing
rapidly
soon
thinned
the
ranks
of
the
javali
and
caused
the
survivors
to
retreat
grunting
and
screaming
into
the
thicket
chapter
sixty
eight
the
woods
on
fire
the
trappers
were
not
among
those
who
had
rescued
me
where
were
they
the
others
made
answer
though
i
already
guessed
what
they
had
to
tell
rube
and
garey
had
followed
the
tracks
of
the
steed
leaving
the
rangers
to
come
after
me
i
was
pleased
with
the
ready
intelligence
of
my
comrades
they
had
acted
exactly
as
they
should
have
done
i
was
myself
found
and
i
no
longer
entertained
any
apprehension
that
the
trail
would
be
lost
by
this
time
the
trackers
must
be
far
upon
it
more
than
an
hour
had
elapsed
since
they
and
the
others
had
parted
company
my
zigzag
path
had
cost
my
followers
many
a
bewildering
pause
but
they
had
not
ridden
recklessly
as
i
and
could
find
their
way
back
as
it
was
impossible
to
tell
in
what
direction
rube
and
garey
had
gone
this
course
was
the
best
to
be
followed
and
under
the
guidance
of
stanfield
an
expert
woodsman
we
rode
back
towards
the
prairie
it
was
not
necessary
to
retrace
our
own
crooked
trail
the
kentuckian
had
noted
the
lay
of
the
chapparal
and
led
us
out
of
its
labyrinths
by
an
almost
direct
path
on
reaching
the
open
ground
we
made
no
pause
but
upon
the
tracks
of
rube
garey
and
the
steed
the
chapparal
we
had
no
difficulty
about
our
course
it
was
plainly
traced
out
for
us
the
trappers
had
blazed
it
in
most
places
the
tracks
of
the
three
horses
were
sufficient
indices
of
the
route
but
there
were
stretches
where
the
ground
was
stony
and
upon
the
parched
arid
herbage
even
the
shod
hoof
left
no
visible
mark
in
such
places
a
branch
of
acacia
broken
and
pendulous
the
bent
of
an
aloe
or
the
succulent
leaves
of
the
cactus
slashed
with
a
sharp
knife
were
conspicuous
and
unmistakeable
signs
and
by
the
guidance
of
these
we
made
rapid
advance
we
must
have
gone
much
faster
than
the
trackers
themselves
for
notwithstanding
the
freshness
of
the
trail
there
were
dry
spots
and
patches
of
cut
rock
over
which
it
passed
and
where
it
must
have
cost
them
both
time
and
keen
perception
to
trace
it
as
we
were
travelling
so
much
more
rapidly
than
rube
and
garey
could
have
done
i
looked
forward
to
our
soon
overtaking
them
with
eager
anticipation
i
looked
forward
surely
they
would
have
some
news
for
me
now
that
they
had
been
so
long
in
the
advance
surely
by
this
time
they
must
have
come
in
sight
of
the
steed
perhaps
captured
him
oh
joyous
anticipation
or
would
they
return
with
a
different
tale
was
i
to
meet
the
report
that
he
still
hurried
on
on
for
ever
that
he
had
swum
some
rapid
stream
or
plunged
over
a
precipice
into
some
dark
abysm
though
hastening
on
after
the
trackers
there
were
moments
when
i
feared
to
overtake
them
moments
when
i
dreaded
to
hear
their
tale
we
had
worked
our
way
about
five
miles
through
the
hideous
jungle
when
i
began
to
feel
a
strange
sensation
in
my
eyes
a
sensation
of
pain
what
is
usually
termed
a
smarting
i
at
first
attributed
it
to
the
want
of
sleep
my
companions
complained
that
they
were
affected
in
a
similar
manner
it
was
not
until
we
had
gone
some
distance
farther
that
we
found
the
true
explanation
on
perceiving
that
there
was
in
the
smoke
it
was
that
was
causing
the
bitterness
in
our
eyes
the
denizen
of
the
prairie
never
regards
such
an
indication
with
indifference
where
there
is
smoke
there
is
fire
and
where
fire
danger
at
least
upon
the
broad
grassy
steppes
of
the
west
a
burning
forest
may
be
shunned
you
may
stand
near
a
forest
on
fire
and
contemplate
such
a
scene
with
safety
but
a
blazing
prairie
is
a
phenomenon
of
a
different
character
and
it
is
indeed
a
rare
position
where
you
may
view
without
peril
this
sublime
spectacle
there
are
prairies
that
will
not
burn
the
plains
covered
with
the
short
and
the
sward
of
various
species
of
gramma
rarely
take
fire
or
if
they
do
horse
man
buffalo
or
antelope
can
easily
escape
by
leaping
across
the
blaze
is
only
the
reptile
world
snakes
lizards
the
toad
and
the
that
fall
victims
to
such
a
flame
not
so
upon
the
or
those
where
the
tall
rises
above
the
withers
of
a
horse
its
culms
matted
and
laced
together
by
the
trailing
stems
of
various
species
of
bindweed
by
creeping
convolvulus
cucurbitacese
and
wild
in
the
dry
season
when
a
fire
lays
its
hold
upon
vegetation
of
this
character
there
is
danger
indeed
where
it
rages
there
is
death
it
was
smoke
that
affected
our
eyes
causing
them
to
wince
and
water
fire
must
be
causing
the
smoke
what
was
on
fire
i
could
detect
apprehension
in
the
looks
of
my
followers
as
we
rode
on
it
was
but
slight
for
as
yet
the
smoke
was
scarcely
perceptible
and
the
fire
wherever
it
was
must
be
distant
so
fancied
we
as
we
advanced
the
glances
of
the
men
became
more
uneasy
beyond
a
doubt
the
smoke
was
thickening
around
us
the
sky
was
fast
becoming
darker
and
the
pain
in
our
eyes
more
acute
the
woods
are
on
fire
said
stanfield
stanfield
was
a
backwoodsman
his
thoughts
ran
upon
woods
whether
forest
or
prairie
a
conflagration
was
certainly
raging
it
might
be
far
off
for
the
wind
will
carry
the
smoke
of
a
prairie
fire
a
long
distance
but
i
had
an
unpleasant
suspicion
that
it
was
distant
i
noticed
dropping
around
us
the
white
floe
of
burnt
leaves
and
from
the
intense
bitterness
of
the
smoke
i
reasoned
that
it
could
not
have
floated
far
its
gases
were
not
yet
dissipated
it
was
not
the
distance
of
the
fire
that
so
much
troubled
me
as
its
direction
the
wind
blew
right
in
our
teeth
and
the
smoke
was
travelling
with
the
wind
the
conflagration
must
be
ahead
directly
upon
the
trail
the
smoke
grew
thicker
and
thicker
ahead
the
sky
appeared
slashed
with
a
lurid
light
i
fancied
i
could
hear
the
crackling
of
the
flames
the
air
felt
hot
and
dry
a
choking
sensation
was
produced
in
our
throats
and
one
and
all
were
hacking
and
gasping
for
breath
so
dark
had
it
suddenly
become
or
rather
so
blinded
were
we
with
the
smoke
we
could
scarcely
make
out
the
trail
my
followers
would
have
stopped
but
i
urged
them
on
with
voice
and
example
i
urged
them
on
myself
leading
the
way
my
heart
was
too
full
of
anxiety
to
make
pause
where
in
all
this
were
rube
and
garey
we
had
come
far
and
fast
we
should
now
be
nearly
up
with
them
they
could
not
be
much
ahead
i
halloed
as
we
advanced
hullow
came
the
response
in
the
rough
baritone
of
the
younger
trapper
we
hurried
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
the
path
conducted
to
an
opening
in
the
chapparal
in
the
centre
of
which
through
the
smoke
we
could
distinguish
the
forms
of
men
and
horses
with
eager
eyes
i
scanned
the
group
a
glance
was
sufficient
there
were
of
each
only
the
trackers

this
assurance
seemed
to
gratify
not
only
the
timid
canadian
but
others
who
up
to
this
moment
were
apprehensive
that
it
was
the
thicket
that
was
on
fire
for
myself
i
had
no
such
fears
i
perceived
that
the
chapparal
could
not
burn
here
and
there
patches
of
dry
would
have
caught
like
tinder
but
in
most
places
a
succulent
endogenous
vegetation
formed
three
parts
of
the
jungle
and
rendered
it
this
was
especially
the
case
around
the
glade
where
the
trappers
had
taken
their
stand
and
which
was
completely
enclosed
by
a
wall
of
the
great
organ
cactus
with
aloes
opuntias
and
other
plants
in
the
opening
we
were
as
safe
from
the
fire
as
though
it
was
a
hundred
miles
off
we
suffered
only
from
the
smoke
that
now
quite
filled
the
atmosphere
causing
a
darkness
that
rivalled
night
itself
i
had
no
apprehension
for
safety
it
was
not
of
that
i
was
thinking
to
the
hasty
dialogue
between
rube
and
the
canadian
i
had
scarcely
given
heed
garey
had
advanced
to
meet
me
and
i
listened
with
anxious
ear
to
the
tale
of
the
tracker
it
was
soon
told
rube
and
he
had
followed
the
trail
until
it
emerged
from
the
chapparal
and
struck
out
into
a
wide
the
edge
of
the
thicket
was
close
by
but
they
had
gone
a
considerable
distance
beyond
it
and
across
the
plain
they
were
still
advancing
when
to
their
consternation
they
perceived
that
the
prairie
was
on
fire
directly
ahead
of
them
the
wind
was
rolling
both
smoke
and
flames
before
it
with
the
rapidity
of
a
running
horse
and
it
was
with
difficulty
they
had
escaped
from
it
by
galloping
back
to
the
chapparal
and
the
steed
what
had
become
of
him
had
they
seen
nothing
i
did
not
put
these
questions
in
words
only
in
thought
did
i
ask
them
and
in
thought
only
were
they
answered
both
the
trackers
were
silent
and
that
was
an
answer
in
the
negative
yes
i
read
an
ominous
negative
in
their
looks
of
gloom
we
were
compelled
to
halt
even
the
smoke
rendered
further
progress
impossible
but
we
could
hear
the
fire
at
no
great
distance
the
culms
of
the
coarse
cracking
like
volleys
of
musketry
now
and
then
a
scared
deer
broke
through
the
bushes
passing
us
at
full
speed
a
band
of
antelopes
dashed
into
the
glade
and
halted
close
beside
us
the
frightened
creatures
not
knowing
where
to
run
at
their
heels
came
a
pack
of
but
not
in
pursuit
of
them
these
also
stopped
near
a
black
bear
and
a
cougar
arrived
next
and
fierce
beasts
of
prey
and
gentle
ruminants
stood
side
by
side
both
terrified
out
of
their
natural
habits
birds
shrieked
among
the
branches
eagles
screamed
in
the
air
and
black
vultures
could
be
seen
hovering
through
the
smoke
with
no
thought
of
stooping
upon
a
quarry
the
hunter
man
alone
preserved
his
instincts
my
followers
were
hungry
rifles
were
levelled
and
the
bear
and
one
of
the
antelopes
fell
victims
to
the
deadly
aim
both
were
soon
stripped
of
their
skins
and
butchered
a
fire
was
kindled
in
the
glade
and
upon
and
sapling
spits
the
choice
morsels
of
venison
and
were
roasted
and
eaten
with
many
a
jest
about
the
smoky
kitchen
i
was
myself
hungered
i
shared
the
repast
but
not
the
merriment
at
that
moment
no
wit
could
have
won
from
me
a
smile
the
most
luxurious
table
could
not
have
furnished
me
with
cheer
a
worse
appetite
than
hunger
assailed
my
companions
and
i
felt
it
with
the
rest
it
was
thirst
for
hours
all
had
been
suffering
from
it
the
long
hard
ride
had
brought
it
on
and
now
the
smoke
and
the
dry
hot
atmosphere
increased
the
appetite
till
it
had
grown
agonising
almost
unendurable
no
water
had
been
passed
since
the
stream
we
had
crossed
before
day
there
was
none
in
the
chapparal
the
trackers
saw
none
so
far
as
they
had
gone
we
were
in
a
waterless
desert
and
the
very
thought
itself
renders
the
pang
of
thirst
keener
and
harder
to
endure
some
chewed
their
leaden
bullets
or
pebbles
of
chalcedony
which
they
had
picked
up
others
obtained
relief
by
drinking
the
blood
of
the
slaughtered
animals
the
bear
and
the
antelope
but
we
found
a
better
source
of
assuagement
in
the
succulent
stems
of
the
cactus
and
agave
the
relief
was
but
temporary
the
juice
cooled
our
lips
and
tongues
but
there
is
an
acrid
principle
in
some
of
these
plants
that
soon
acted
and
our
thirst
became
more
intense
than
ever
some
talked
of
returning
on
the
trail
in
search
of
water
of
going
back
even
to
the
stream
more
than
twenty
miles
distant
under
such
circumstances
even
military
command
loses
its
authority
nature
is
stronger
than
martial
law
i
cared
not
if
they
did
return
i
cared
not
who
left
me
so
long
as
the
trappers
remained
true
i
had
no
fear
that
they
would
forsake
me
and
my
disapprobation
of
it
checked
the
cheerless
proposal
and
once
more
all
declared
their
willingness
to
go
on
fortunately
at
that
crisis
the
smoke
began
to
clear
away
and
the
atmosphere
to
lighten
up
the
fire
had
burnt
on
to
the
edge
of
the
chapparal
where
it
was
now
opposed
by
the
trees
the
grass
had
been
all
consumed
the
conflagration
was
at
an
end
mounting
our
horses
we
rode
out
from
the
glade
and
following
the
trail
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
we
emerged
from
the
thicket
and
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
desolated
plain
chapter
seventy
a
burnt
prairie
the
earth
offers
no
aspect
more
drear
and
desolate
than
that
of
a
burnt
prairie
the
ocean
when
its
waves
are
grey
a
blighted
heath
a
flat
fenny
country
under
a
rapid
thaw
all
these
impress
the
beholder
with
a
feeling
of
chill
monotony
but
the
water
has
motion
the
heath
colour
and
the
flat
exhibits
variety
in
its
mottling
of
white
and
ground
not
so
the
steppe
that
has
been
fired
and
burned
in
this
the
eye
perceives
neither
colour
nor

nor
motion
it
roams
over
the
limitless
level
in
search
of
one
or
other
but
in
vain
and
in
the
absence
of
all
three
it
tires
and
the
heart
grows
cheerless
and
sick
even
the
sky
scarcely
offers
relief
it
too
by

from
the

beneath

perhaps
the

to

the

as

than

of

red
and
orange
even
these
fair
tints
grow
tiresome
to
the
sight
and
the
eye
yearns
for
form
and
motion
if
so
what
must
be
the
prairie
when
divested
of
all
these
verdant
and
flowery
charms
when
burned
to
black
ashes
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
the
aspect
of
dreary
monotony
it
then
presents
more
difficult
to
describe
it
words
will
not
paint
such
a
scene
and
such
presented
itself
to
our
eyes
as
we
rode
out
from
the
chapparal
the
fire
was
past
even
the
smoke
had
ceased
to
ascend
except
in
spots
where
the
damp
earth
still
reeked
under
the
heat
but
right
and
left
and
far
ahead
on
to
the
very
hem
of
the
horizon
the
surface
was
of
one
uniform
hue
as
if
covered
with
a
vast
crape
there
was
nought
of
form
to
be
seen
living
or
lifeless
there
was
neither
life
nor
motion
even
in
the
elements
all
sounds
had
ceased
an
awful
stillness
reigned
above
and
around
the
world
seemed
dead
and
shrouded
in
a
vast
sable
pall
under
other
circumstances
i
might
have
stayed
to
regard
such
a
scene
though
not
to
admire
it
on
that
interminable
waste
there
was
nought
to
be
admired
not
even
sublimity
but
no
spectacle
however
sublime
however
beautiful
could
have
won
from
me
a
thought
at
that
moment
the
trackers
had
already
ridden
far
out
and
were
advancing
half
concealed
by
the
cloud
of
black
stoor
flung
up
from
the
heels
of
their
horses
for
some
distance
they
moved
straight
on
without
looking
for
the
tracks
of
the
steed
before
meeting
the
fire
they
had
traced
them
beyond
the
edge
of
the
chapparal
and
therefore
knew
the
direction
after
a
while
i
observed
them
moving
more
slowly
with
their
eyes
upon
the
ground
as
if
they
had
lost
it
i
had
doubts
of
their
being
able
either
to
find
or
follow
it
now
the
shallow
would
be
filled
with
the
debris
of
the
burnt
herbage
surely
they
could
no
longer
be
traced
by
myself
they
could
not
nor
by
a
common
man
but
it
seemed
that
to
the
eyes
of
those
keen
hunters
the
trail
was
as
conspicuous
as
ever
i
saw
that
after
searching
a
few
seconds
they
had
taken
it
up
and
were
once
more
moving
along
guided
by
the
tracks
some
slight
hollows
i
could
perceive
distributed
here
and
there
over
the
ground
and
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
surrounding
level
certainly
without
having
been
told
what
they
were
i
should
not
have
known
them
to
be
the
tracks
of
a
horse
it
proved
a
wide
prairie
and
we
seemed
to
be
crossing
its
central
part
the
fire
had
spread
far
at
one
place
nearly
midway
where
the
trail
was
faint
and
difficult
to
make
out
we
stopped
for
a
short
while
to
give
the
trackers
time
a
momentary
curiosity
induced
me
to
gaze
around
awful
was
the
scene
awful
without
sublimity
even
the
thorny
chapparal
no
longer
relieved
the
eye
the
outline
of
its
low
shrubbery
had
sunk
below
the
horizon
and
on
all
sides
stretched
the
charred
plain
up
to
the
rim
of
the
leaden
canopy
black
black
illimitable
had
i
been
alone
i
might
easily
have
yielded
to
the
fancy
that
the
world
was
dead
gazing
over
this
vast
opacity
i
for
a
moment
forgot
my
companions
and
fell
into
a
sort
of
lethargic
stupor
i
fancied
that
i
too
was
dead
or
dreaming
i
fancied
that
i
was
in
hell
the
avernus
of
the
ancients
in
my
youth
i
had
the
misfortune
to
be
well
schooled
in
classic
lore
to
the
neglect
of
studies
more
useful
and
often
in
life
have
the
poetical
absurdities
of
greek
and
latin
mythology
intruded
themselves
upon
my
spirit
both
asleep
and
awake
i
fancied
therefore
that
some
anchises
had
introduced
me
to
the
regions
below
and
that
the
black
plain
before
me
was
some
landscape
in
the
kingdom
of
pluto
reflection
had
i
been
capable
of
that
would
have
convinced
me
of
my
error
no
part
of
that
monarch
dominions
can
be
so
thinly
peopled
i
was
summoned
to
reason
again
by
the
voices
of
my
followers
the
lost
trail
had
been
found
and
they
were
moving
on
chapter
seventy
one
the
talk
of
the
trackers
i
spurred
after
and
soon
overtook
them
regardless
of
the
dust
i
rode
close
in
the
rear
of
the
trackers
and
listened
to
what
they
were
saying
these
men
of
the
mountains
as
they
prided
to
call
themselves
were
peculiar
in
everything
while
engaged
in
a
duty
such
as
the
present
they
would
scarce
disclose
their
thoughts
even
to
me
much
less
were
they
communicative
with
the
rest
of
my
following
whom
they
were
accustomed
to
regard
as
greenhorns
their
favourite
appellation
for
all
men
who
have
not
made
the
tour
of
the
grand
prairies
notwithstanding
that
stanfield
and
black
were
backwoodsmen
and
hunters
by
profession
quackenboss
a
splendid
shot
le
blanc
a
regular
and
the
others
more
or
less
skilled
in
woodcraft
all
were
greenhorns
in
the
opinion
of
the
trappers
to
be
otherwise
a
man
must
have
starved
upon
a
run
buffalo
by
the
yellowstone
or
platte
fought
injun
and
shot
indian
have
lost
scalp
or
ears
spent
a
winter
in
pierre
hole
upon
green
river
or
camped
amid
the
snows
of
the
rocky
mountains
some
one
of
all
these
feats
must
needs
have
been
performed
ere
the
greenhorn
can
matriculate
and
take
rank
as
a
mountain
man
i
of
all
my
party
was
the
only
one
who
in
the
eyes
of
rube
and
garey
was
a
greenhorn
and
even
i
that
i
was
was
hardly
up
either
in
their
confidence
or
their
craft
it
is
indeed
true
with
all
my
classic
accomplishments
with
my
fine
words
my
fine
horse
and
fine
clothes
so
long
as
we
were
within
the
limits
of
i
acknowledged
these
men
as
my
superiors
they
were
my
guides
my
instructors
my
masters
since
overtaking
them
on
the
trail
i
had
not
asked
them
to
give
any
opinion
i
dreaded
a
direct
answer
for
i
had
noticed
something
like
a
despairing
look
in
the
eyes
of
both
as
i
followed
them
over
the
black
plain
however
i
thought
that
their
faces
brightened
a
little
and
appeared
once
more
lit
up
by
a
faint
ray
of
hope
for
that
reason
i
rode
close
upon
their
heels
and
eagerly
caught
up
every
word
that
was
passing
between
them

thet
story
thet
dutch
an
frenchy
hev
fetched
from
the
rancherie
gies
me
a
insight
inter
the
hull
bizness
i
knew
the
story
to
which
rube
had
reference
lige
and
le
blanc
when
at
the
village
had
heard
some
rumour
of
an
indian
foray
that
had
just
been
made
against
one
of
the
mexican
towns
not
far
from
the
rancheria
it
had
occurred
on
the
same
day
that
we
marched
out
the
indians
supposed
to
be
lipans
or
comanches
had
sacked
the
place
and
carried
off
both
plunder
and
captives
a
party
of
them
had
passed
near
the
rancheria
after
we
ourselves
had
left
it
this
party
had
called
at
the
hacienda
de
vargas
and
completed
the
pillage
left
unfinished
by
the
guerilla
this
was
the
substance
of
what
the
messengers
had
heard
you
mean
about
the
injuns
said
garey
half
interrogatively
in
coorse
rejoined
rube
belike
enuf

the

niggurs

a
chance
at
the
mexikin
town
an
thur

why

it
ur
plain
as

on
a
summery
day
i
do

responded
garey
in
a
thoughtful
tone
well
this
child
an
this
ur
the
reezun
as
i
tell
the
injuns
hai
forgot
the
lambaystin
they
hed
by

an
preehaps
bein
now
a
weak
party
an
thinkin
thet
we
as

still
i

thet
on

o
thur

they
burnt
the
parairy
to
kiver
thur
trail
preezactly
so
by
gosh
you
right
rube
it
uncommon
like
but
whar
do
you
think
this
trail
goin
surely
the
hoss
hai
been
caught
in
the
fire
i
bent
forward
in
the
saddle
and
listened
with
acute
eagerness
to
my
great
relief
the
answer
of
the
old
trapper
was
in
the
negative
he
hai
said
he
a
bit
o
it
his
trail
do
ee
see
runs
in
a
or
clost
on
a
now
ef
the
fire
hed
begun
afore
he
wur
acrosst
this
paraira
he
wud
long
since
doubled
an
tuk
the
back
track
but
see
he
hai
did
so
thurfor
i
conclude
safe
through
it
an
the
grass
must
been
sot
afire
ahint
i
breathed
freely
after
listening
to
these
words
a
load
seemed
lifted
from
my
breast
for
up
to
this
moment
i
had
been
vainly
endeavouring
to
combat
the
fearful
apprehension
that
had
shaped
itself
in
my
imagination
from
the
moment
that
we
had
entered
the
burning
prairie
my
eyes
constantly
and
almost
mechanically
had
sought
the
ground
in
front
of
our
course
had
wandered
over
it
with
uneasy
glance
in
dread
of
beholding
forms
lifeless
burned
and
charred
the
words
of
the
trapper
gave
relief
almost
an
assurance
that
the
steed
and
his
rider
were
still
safe
and
under
the
inspiration
of
renewed
hope
i
rode
forward
with
lighter
heart
chapter
seventy
two
injun
sign
after
a
pause
the
guides
resumed
their
conversation
and
i
continued
to
listen
i
had
a
reason
for
not
mingling
in
it
if
i
joined
them
in
their
counsels
they
might
not
express
their
convictions
so
freely
and
i
was
desirous
of
knowing
what
they
truly
thought
by
keeping
close
behind
them
i
could
hear
all
myself
unnoticed
under
the
cloud
of
dust
that
ascended
around
us
on
the
soft
ashes
the
was
scarcely
audible
our
horses
gliding
along
in
a
sweeping
silent
walk
by
gosh
then
said
garey
if
injuns
fired
the
parairy
they
must
done
it
to
an

travellin

old

ay
replied
rube
in
a
low
but
significant
drawl
ef
it
do
an
ef
this
niggur
do
a
miskalkerlate
it
lead
right
on
straight
custrut
into
thur
i
started
on
hearing
this
i
could
no
longer
remain
silent
but
brushing
rapidly
forward
to
the
side
of
the
trapper
in
hasty
phrase
demanded
his
meaning
jest
what
heern
me
say
young
fellur
was
his
reply
you
think
that
there
are
indians
ahead
that
the
horse
has
gone
to
their
camp
no
not
thur
nor
kin
i
say
for
sartint
thur
ur
injuns
ahead
though
it
looks
mighty
like
thur
nuthin
else
to
guv
reezun
for
the
fire
nuthin
as
bill
or
me
kin
think
o
an
ef
thur
be
injuns
then
i
do
think
the
hoss
hez
to
thur
camp
but
i
do
kalkerlate
mighty
like
he
been
thur
thet
what
i
thinks
young
fellur
you
mean
that
the
indians
have
captured
him
thet
preezactly
what
this
child
means
but
how
what
reason
have
you
for
thinking
so
wal
jest
because
i
think
so
pray
explain
rube
i
said
in
an
appealing
tone
i
feared
that
his
secretive
instincts
would
get
the
better
of
him
and
he
would
delay
giving
his
reasons
out
of
the
pure
love
of
mystification
that
was
inherent
in
the
old
fellow
nature
i
was
too

were
fixed
what
is

i

nothing

as

i
certainly
noticed
some
slight

nearly
levelled

said
one
of
the
rangers
riding
up
and
surveying
the
sign
wild
jackasses
angrily
retorted
the
old
trapper
whur
did
ever
see
a
do
i
turned
do
stan
thur
my
mar
he
cried
talking
to
his
mare
flinging
his
lean
carcass
out
of
the
saddle
at
the
same
time
stan
thur
knows
better

how
a
mountain
man
kin
read
sign
wagh
after
thus
delivering
himself
the
trapper
dropped
upon
his
knees
placed
his
lips
close
to
the
ground
and
commenced
blowing
at
the
black
ashes
the
others
had
by
this
time
ridden
up
and
sat
in
their
saddles
watching
him
we
saw
that
he
was
clearing
the
ashes
out
of
one
of
the
hollows
which
he
had
pronounced
to
be
and
which
now
proved
to
be
so
now
mister
said
he
turning
triumphantly
and
rather
savagely
upon
the
ranger
who
had
questioned
the
truth
of
his
conjecture
a
track
shod
wi
parflesh
too
did
ever
see
a
or
a
wild
mule
or
a
wild
jackass

ef
did
it
rube
rawlins
ever
seed
an
thet
ur
trapper
been
on
the
forty
yeern
wagh
of
course
there
was
no
reply
to
this
interrogatory
there
was
the
track
and
dismounting
all
examined
it
in
turn
sure
enough
it
was
the
track
of
a
shod
horse
shod
with
thick
leather
made
from
the
hide
of
the
buffalo
bull
we
all
knew
this
to
be
a
mode
of
shoeing
practised
by
the
of
the
plains
and
only
by
them
the
evidence
was
conclusive
indians
had
been
upon
the
ground
chapter
seventy
three
translating
the
sign
this
discovery
brought
us
to
a
pause
a
consultation
ensued
in
which
all
took
part
but
as
usual
the
others
listened
to
the
opinions
of
the
and
especially
to
that
of
rube
the
old
trapper
was
inclined
to
sulk
for
some
time
and
acted
as
if
he
meant
to
withhold
his
advice
nothing
miffed
him
more
than
to
have
his
word
contradicted
or
his
skill
called
in
question
i
have
known
him
to
be
out
of
sorts
for
days
from
having
his
doubted
by
some
one
whom
he
deemed
less
experienced
than
himself
and
indeed
there
were
few
of
his
kind
whose
knowledge
of
the
wilderness
was
at
all
comparable
with
his
he
was
not
always
in
the
right
but
generally
where
instincts
failed
it
wat
idle
to
try
further
in
the
present
case
the
man
who
had
thoughtlessly
doubted
him
was
one
of
the
greenest
of
the
party
but
this
only
aggravated
the
matter
in
the
eyes
of
old
rube
sich
a
fellur
as
you
he
said
giving
a
last
dig
to
the
offending
ranger
sich
a
fellur
as
you
oughter
keep
yur
head
shet
up
thet
ur
tongue
o
yourn
s
allers
a
gwine
like
a
bull
tail
in
wagh
as
the
man
made
no
reply
to
this
rather
rough
remonstrance
dander
soon
smoothed
down
and
once
more
becoming
cool
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
business
of
the
hour
that
there
had
been
indians
upon
the
ground
was
now
an
ascertained
fact
the
peculiar
shoeing
of
the
horses
rendered
it
indubitable
mexican
horses
if
shod
at
all
would
have
had
a
shoeing
of
iron
at
least
on
their
wild
mustangs
would
have
had
the
hoof
naked
while
the
tracks
of
texan
or
american
horses
could
have
been
easily
told
either
from
the
peculiar
shoeing
or
the
superior
size
of
their
hoofs
the
horses
that
had
galloped
over
that
ground
were
neither
wild
texan
nor
mexican
indian
they
must
have
been
although
the
one
track
first
examined
might
have
settled
the
point
it
was
a
fact
of
too
much
importance
to
be
left
under
the
slightest
doubt
the
presence
of
indians
meant
the
presence
of
enemies
foes
dire
and
deadly
and
it
was
with
something
more
than
feelings
of
mere
curiosity
that
my
companions
scrutinised
the
sign
the
ashes
were
blown
out
from
several
others
and
these
carefully
studied
additional
facts
were
brought
to
light
by
those
champollions
of
the
prairie
rube
and
garey
whoever
rode
the
horses
had
been
going
in
a
gallop
they
had
not
ridden
long
in
one
course
but
here
and
there
had
turned
and
struck
off
in
new
directions
there
had
been
a
score
or
so
of
them
no
two
had
been
galloping
together
their
tracks
converged
or
crossed
one
another
now
zigzagging
now
running
in
right
lines
or
sweeping
in
curves
and
circles
over
the
plain
all
this
knowledge
the
trackers
had
obtained
in
less
than
ten
minutes
simply
by
riding
around
and
examining
the
tracks
not
to
disturb
them
in
their
diagnosis
the
rest
of
us
halted
and
awaited
the
result
of
their
scrutiny
in
ten
minutes
time
both
came
back
to
us
they
had
read
the
sign
to
their
satisfaction
and
needed
no
further
light
that
sign
had
disclosed
to
them
one
fact
of
more
significance
than
all
the
rest
of
course
we
all
knew
that
the
indian
horsemen
had
gone
over
the
ground
before
the
grass
had
been
burnt
but
how
long
before
we
had
no
difficulty
in
making
out
that
it
was
upon
that
same
day
and
since
the
rising
of
the
sun
these
were
trifles
easily
ascertained
but
at
had
they
passed
late
or
early
with
the
steed
before
or
after
him
about
this
point
i
was
most
anxious
but
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
it
could
be
decided
by
the
sign
to
my
astonishment
those
cunning
hunters
returned
to
tell
me
not
only
the
very
hour
at
which
the
steed
had
passed
the
spot
but
also
that
the
indian
horsemen
had
been
riding
clairvoyance
could
scarcely
have
gone
farther
the
old
trapper
had
grown
expletive
more
than
was
his
wont
it
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
tracking
the
white
steed
indians
were
near
caution
had
become
necessary
and
neither
the
company
nor
counsel
of
the
humblest
was
to
be
scorned
we
might
soon
stand
in
need
of
the
strength
even
of
the
weakest
in
our
party
freely
then
the
trackers
communicated
their
discoveries
in
answer
to
my
interrogation

ur
the
conclusion
was
clear
indeed
the
indians
must
have
been
him
we
stayed
no
longer
upon
the
spot
but
once
more
sending
the
trackers
forward
moved
on
after
them
we
had
advanced
about
farther
when
the
hitherto
scattered
and
tending
in
different
directions
became
merged
together
as
though
the
indians
had
been
riding
not
in
single
file
as
is
their
ordinary
method
but
in
an
irregular
body
of
several
abreast
the
trackers
after
proceeding
along
this
new
trail
for
a
hundred
yards
or
so
deliberately
drew
up
and
dismounting
bent
down
upon
their
hands
and
knees
as
if
once
more
to
examine
the
sign
the
rest
of
us
halted
a
little
behind
and
watched
their
proceedings
without
offering
to
interrupt
them
both
were
observed
to
be
busy
blowing
aside
the
ashes
not
now
from
any
particular
track
but
from
the
full
breadth
of
the
trail
in
a
few
minutes
they
succeeded
in
removing
the
black
dust
from
a
stretch
of
several
yards
so
that
the
numerous
could
be
distinctly
traced
side
by
side
or
overlapping
and
half
obliterating
one
another
rube
now
returned
to
where
they
had
commenced
and
then
once
more
leisurely
advancing
upon
his
knees
with
eyes
close
to
the
surface
appeared
to
scrutinise
the
print
of
every
hoof
separately
before
he
had
reached
the
spot
where
garey
was
still
engaged
in
clearing
off
the
dust
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
an
air
that
told
he
was
satisfied
and
turning
to
his
companion
cried
out
do
bother

bill
it

jest

i
thort
they
roped
by

chapter
seventy
four
the

it
was
not
the
emphatic
tone
in
which
this
announcement
was
made
that
produced
within
me
conviction
of
its
truth
i
should
have
been
convinced
without
that
i
was
better
than
half
prepared
for
the
intelligence
thus
rudely
conveyed
for
i
was
myself
not
altogether
unskilled
in
that
art
of
which
my
were
masters
i
had
observed
the
sudden
convergence
of
the
i
had
noticed
also
that
after
coming
together
the
animals
had
proceeded
at
a
slow
pace
at
a
walk
i
needed
only
to
perceive
the
hoof
of
the
steed
among
the
others
to
know
that
he
no
longer
ran
free
that
he
was
a
captive
this
the
tracker
had
found
hence
the
decisive
declaration
that
the
indians
had
roped
him
in
other
words
had
caught
him

their
lazoes

somewhur
hyur
by

thur
boun
to
be
sartint
as
the
suspicion
that
had
half
formed
itself
in
my
mind
was
no
longer
hypothetical
the
sign
upon
the
trail
had
settled
that
it
was
now
a
positive
intelligence
a
conviction
the
steed
had
been
taken
he
and
his
rider
were
captive
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
this
knowledge
brought
with
it
a
crowd
of
new
thoughts
in
which
emotions
of
the
most
opposite
character
were
mingled
together
the
first
was
a
sensation
of
joy
the
steed
had
been
captured
and
by
human
beings
indians
at
least
were
men
and
possessed
human
hearts
though
in
the
rider
they
might
recognise
the
lineaments
of
their
foes
not
so
strongly
neither
yet
a
woman
and
in
such
a
dilemma
what
reason
could
they
have
for
hostility
to
her
none
perhaps
the
very
opposite
passion
might
be
excited
by
the
spectacle
of
her
helpless
situation
they
would
see
before
them
the
victim
of
some
cruel
revenge
the
act
too
of
their
own
enemies
this
would
be
more
likely
to
inspire
them
with
sympathy
and
pity
they
would
relieve
her
from
her
perilous
position
would
minister
to
her
wants
and
wounds
would
tenderly
nurse
and
cherish
her
yes
of
all
this
i
felt
confident
they
were
human
how
could
they
do
otherwise
such
was
the
first
rush
of
my
reflections
on
becoming
assured
that
the
steed
had
been
captured
by
indians
that
isolina
was
in
their
hands
i
only
thought
of
her
safety
that
she
was
rescued
from
pain
and
peril
perhaps
from
death
and
the
thought
was
a
gleam
of
joy
alas
only
a
gleam
and
the
reflections
that
followed
were
painfully
bitter
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
character
of
the
savages
into
whose
hands
she
had
fallen
if
they
were
the
same
band
that
had
harried
the
frontier
town
then
were
they
southern
indians
comanche
or
lipan
the
report
said
one
or
other
and
it
was
but
too
probable
true
the
remnant
of
shawanos
and
delawares
with
the
kickapoos
and
texan
cherokees
sometimes
stray
as
far
as
the
banks
of
the
rio
grande
but
the
conduct
was
not
theirs
these
tribes
from
long
intercourse
with
whites
have
been
inducted
into
a
sort
of
and
their
hereditary
hostility
for
the
has
died
out
pillage
and
murder
are
no
longer
their
trade
it
could
not
have
been
they
who
had
made
the
late
foray
it
might
have
been
wild
cat
with
his
wicked
seminoles
now
settled
on
the
texan
frontier
but
the
act
was
more
in
keeping
with
the
character
of
the
apaches
who
of
late
years
had
been
pushing
their
expeditions
far
down
the
river
even
so
it
mattered
little
apaches
are
but
comanches
or
rather
comanches
apaches
and
whether
the
indians
on
whose
trail
we
were
standing
were
one
or
the
other
whether
apache
lipan
comanche
or
their
allies
caygua
waco
or
it
mattered
not
one
and
all
were
alike
one
or
other
of
them
my
reflections
were
bitterly
the
same
well
understood
i
the
character
of
these
red
men
of
the
south
so
far
differing
from
their
kindred
of
the
north
so
far
different
from
that
ideal
type
of
cold
continence
it
has
pleased
the
poet
and
the
writer
of
romance
to
ascribe
to
them
the
reverse
of
the
medal
was
before
my
mind
eye
the
memory
of
many
a
scene
was
in
my
thoughts
of
many
a
tale
i
had
heard
illustrating
the
uxorious
disposition
the
wild
unbridled
wantonness
of
these
lords
of
the
southern
plains
not
then
did
i
dwell
long
on
such
thoughts
for
they
had
their
influence
in
urging
me
onward
and
onward
i
spurred
there
was
another
reason
for
our
rapid
advance
all
of
us
were
under
the
extreme
agony
of
thirst
literally
gasping
for
water
and
thus
physical
suffering
impelled
us
to
ride
forward
as
fast
as
our
jaded
horses
could
carry
us
over
the
ground
timber
was
at
length
before
our
eyes
green
foliage
looking
all
the
fresher
and
brighter
from
contrast
with
the
black
plain
which
it
bounded
it
was
a
grove
of
cottonwoods
skirting
a
and
beyond
this
the
fire
had
not
extended
wild
joyous
cries
escaped
from
men
and
horses
as
their
eyes
rested
upon
the
limpid
stream
the
men
galloped
over
the
bank
leaped
out
of

without
a
thought
of
drowning
plunged
into
the
water
some
lifted
the
crystal
liquid
in
their
palms
others
more
impatient
bent
down
and
ducking
their
faces
in
the
flood
drank
la

i
noticed
that
the
trappers
behaved
less
recklessly
than
the
rest
before
going
down
to
drink
the
eyes
of
both
were
directed
with
instinctive
caution
along
the
banks
and
into
the
timber
close
to
where
we
had
halted
i
observed
a
crossing
where
numerous
tracks
of
animals
formed
in
the
soil
a
deep
path
eyes
were
upon
it
and
i
saw
that
they
were
glistening

unusual
excitement

you
may
be
asking
what
the
trapper
meant
by
a
it
has
been
a
phrase
of
frequent
occurrence
with
us
it
is
a
phrase
of
the
frontier
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
let
me
offer
its
explanation
for
half
a
century
ay
for
three
centuries
and
more
even
since
the
conquest
itself
the
northern
frontier
of
mexico
has
been
in
what
is
termed
in
phraseology
a
disturbed
state
though
the
aztecs
and
the
kindred
races
of
indians
easily
yielded
to
the
sword
of
the
spanish
conquerors
far
different
has
been
the
history
of
the
wild
tribes
the
free
hunters
of
the
plains
upon
those
mighty
steppes
that
occupy
the
whole
central
area
of
the
north
american
continent
dwell
tribes
of
indians
nations
they
might
be
called
who
neither
know
nor
ever
have
known
other
rule
than
that
of
their
own
chieftains
even
when
spain
was
at
her
strongest
she
failed
to
subjugate
the
indios
bravos
of
her
frontiers
who
to
the
present
hour
have
preserved
their
wild
freedom
i
speak
not
of
the
great
nations
of
the
northern
prairies
sioux
and
cheyenne
blackfeet
and
crow
pawnee
and
arapahoe
with
these
the
spanish
race
scarcely
ever
came
in
contact
i
refer
more
particularly
to
the
tribes
whose
range
impinges
upon
the
frontiers
of
mexico
comanche
lipan
utah
apache
and
navajo
it
is
not
in
the
annals
of
spain
to
prove
that
any
one
of
these
tribes
ever
yielded
to
her
conquering
sword
and
equally
a
failure
has
been
the
attempt
to
wheedle
them
into
a
fanatical
civilisation
by
the
conquest
of
the
free
then
the
prairie
indians
are
from
white
man
rule
and
free
have
they
been
as
though
the
keels
of
columbus
had
never
ploughed
the
carib
sea
but
although
they
have
preserved
their
independence
for
three
centuries
for
three
centuries
have
they
never
known
peace
between
the
red
indian
and
the
white
iberian

the

of
northern
mexico

existed
since
the
days
of

the
present

constantly
shifting
north
or

the

to
a

of

lies

the

side
half
defended
by
a
line
of
garrisoned
forts
on
the
other
sheltered
from
attack
by
the
wild
and
waterless
desert
i
have
stated
that
this
has
been
constantly
shifting
either
northward
or
southward
such
was
its
history
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
present
cycle
since
then
a
remarkable
change
has
been
going
forward
in
the
relative
position
of
indian
and
iberian
and
the
line
of
hostile
ground
has
been
moving
only
in
one
direction
continually
the
to
speak
in
less
metaphorical
phrase
the
red
man
has
been
encroaching
upon
the
territory
of
the
white
man
the
savage
has
been
gaining
ground
upon
the
domain
of
civilisation
not
slowly
or
gradually
either
but
by
gigantic
strides
by
the
conquest
of
whole
provinces
as
large
as
england
ten
times
told
i
shall
make
the
announcement
of
a
fact
or
rather
a
hypothesis
scarcely
well
known
though
strange
enough
it
may
interest
if
not
surprise
the
ethnologist
i
assert
then
that
had
the
four
tribes
of
north
mexican
indians
comanche
lipano
apache
and
navajo
been
left
to
themselves
less
than
another
century
they
would
have
driven
the
degenerate
descendants
of
the
conquerors
of
cortez
from
the
soil
of
i
make
this
assertion
with
a
full
belief
and
clear
conviction
of
its
truthfulness
the
hypothesis
rests
upon
a
basis
of
realities
it
would
require
but
very
simple
logic
to
prove
it
but
a
few
facts
may
yield
illustration
with
the
fall
of
spanish
rule
in
mexico
ended
the
predominance
of
the
spaniard
over
the
indian
by
revolution
the
presidios
became
shorn
of
their
strength
and
no
longer
offered
a
barrier
even
to
the
weakest
incursion
in
fact
a
neutral
line
no
more
exists
whole
provinces
sonora
chihuahua
tamaulipas
cinaloa
and
leon
are
no
better
than
neutral
ground
or
to
speak
more
definitely
form
an
extended
territory
conquered
and
desolated
by
the
indians
even
beyond
these
into
the
provincias
internas
have
the
bold
freebooters
of
late
carried
their
forays
even
to
the
very
gates
of
durango
two
hundred
comanche
warriors
or
as
many
apaches
fear
not
to
ride
hundreds
of
miles
into
the
heart
of
civilised
mexico
hesitate
not
to
attack
a
city
or
a
settlement
scruple
not
to
drag
from
hearth
and
home
lovely
maids
and
tender
children
these
and
carry
them
slave
and
captive
to
their
wild
fastnesses
in
the
desert
and
this
is
no
occasional
foray
no
long
gathering
outburst
of
revenge
or
retaliation
but
an
expedition
forming
part
of
the
regular
routine
of
the
year
and
occurring
at
the
season
when
the
buffalo
have
migrated
to
the
north
occurring
in
that
month
in
the
calendar
of
these
aboriginal
brigands
jocosely
styled
the
mexican
moon
upon
whose
head
falls
the
blow
thus
periodically
repeated
upon
the
poor
and
unprotected
no
doubt
you
will
fancy
so
a
single
fact
may
serve
to
undeceive
you
only
a
few
years
ago
trias
a
man
of
first
family
in
mexico
and
governor
of
the
large
state
of
chihuahua
lost
one
of
his
sons
by
an
indian
foray
the
boy
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
comanches
and
it
was
only
after
years
of
negotiation
and
payment
of
a
large
sum
that
the
father
recovered
his
child
thus
the
governor
of
a
province
with
means
and
military
at
his
command
was
not
powerful
enough
to
cause
the
surrender
of
his
captive
son
he
was
forced
to
him
it
is
computed
that
at
this
moment
there
are
three
thousand
white
captives
in
the
hands
of
the
north
mexican
indians
nearly
all
of
them
of
spanish
descent
they
are
mostly
females
and
live
as
the
of
their
captors
if
such
connexion
may
be
dignified
by
the
name
there
are
white
men
too
among
the
indians
prisoners
taken
in
their
youth
and
strange
as
it
may
appear
few
of
them
either
of
the
men
or
women
evince
any
desire
to
return
to
their
former
life
or
homes
some
when
ransomed
have
refused
the
boon
not
uncommon
along
the
frontier
has
been
witnessed
that
scene
a
father
who
had
recovered
his
child
from
the
savages
and
yet
unable
to
reclaim
its
affection
or
even
to
arouse
it
to
a
recognition
of
its
parentage
in
a
few
years
sometimes
only
months
the
captives
forget
their
early
ties
and
become
wedded
to
their
new
life
become
but
a
short
time
before
an
instance
had
come
under
our
own
observation
the
wounded
brave
taken
in
the
skirmish
at
the
mound
was
a
mexican
had
been
carried
off
by
the
comanches
some
years
before
from
the
settlements
on
the
lower
rio
grande
in
consideration
of
this
we
gave
him
his
liberty
under
the
impression
that
he
would
gladly
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
return
to
his
kindred
he
proved
wanting
in
gratitude
as
in
natural
affection
the
same
night
on
which
he
was
set
free
he
took
the
route
back
to
the
prairies
mounted
upon
one
of
the
best
horses
of
our
troop
which
he
had
stolen
from
its
unfortunate
owner
such
are
the
cosas
de
mexico
a
few
of
the
traits
of
on
the
rio
bravo
del
norte
but
what
of
the
that
is
not
yet
explained
know
then
that
from
the
country
of
the
indians
to
that
of
the
mexicans
extend
many
great
paths
running
for
hundreds
of
miles
from
point
to
point
they
follow
the
courses
of
streams
or
cross
vast
desert
plains
where
water
is
found
only
at
long
intervals
of
distance
they
are
marked
by
the
tracks
of
mules
horses
and
captives
here
and
there
they
are
whitened
by
bones
the
bones
of
men
of
women
of
animals
that
have
perished
by
the
way
strange
paths
are
these
what
are
they
and
who
have
made
them
who
travel
by
these
roads
that
lead
through
the
wild
and
homeless
desert
indians
they
are
the
paths
of
the
comanche
and
caygua
the
roads
made
by
their
warriors
during
the
mexican
moon
it
was
upon
one
of
these
that
the
trapper
was
gazing
when
he
gave
out
the
emphatic
utterance
by
the
eturnal
chapter
seventy
six
on
the
scarcely
staying
to
quench
my
thirst
i
led
my
horse
across
the
stream
and
commenced
scrutinising
the
trail
upon
the
opposite
bank
the
faithful
trackers
were
by
my
side
no
fear
of
them
lagging
behind
i
had
won
the
hearts
of
both
these
men
and
that
they
would
have
risked
life
to
serve
me
i
could
no
longer
doubt
since
over
and
over
again
they
risked
it
for
garey
strong
courageous
handsome
in
the
true
sense
and
i
felt
real
friendship
which
the
young
trapper
reciprocated
for
his
older
comrade
the
feeling
i
had
was
like
himself
indefinable
indescribable
it
was
strongly
tinctured
with
admiration
but
admiration
of
the
intellectual
rather
than
the
moral
or
personal
qualities
of
the
man
instead
of
intellectual
i
should
rather
say
instinctive
for
his
keen
intuitive
thoughts
appeared
more
like
instincts
than
the
results
of
a
process
of
ratiocination
that
the
old
trapper
admired
me
in
his
own
phraseology
liked
me
mightily
i
was
aware
he
was
equally
zealous
as
the
younger
in
my
service
but
too
free
an
exhibition
of
zeal
was
in
his
eyes
a
weakness
and
he
endeavoured
to
conceal
it
his
admiration
of
myself
was
perhaps
owing
to
the
fact
that
i
neither
attempted
to
thwart
him
in
his
humours
nor
rival
him
in
his
peculiar
knowledge
the
craft
of
the
prairie
in
this
i
was
but
his
pupil
and
behaved
as
such
generally
deferring
to
his
judgment
another
impulse
acted
upon
the
trackers
sheer
love
of
the
part
they
were
now
playing
just
as
the
hound
loves
the
trail
so
did
they
and
hunger
thirst
weariness
one
or
all
must
be
felt
to
an
extreme
degree
before
they
would
voluntarily
forsake
it
scarcely
staying
therefore
to
quench
their
thirst
they
followed
me
out
of
the
water
and
all
three
of
us
together
bent
our
attention
to
the
sign
it
was
a
a
true
there
was
not
the
track
of
a
dog
not
the
drag
of
a
upon
it
had
it
been
a
moving
encampment
of
peaceable
indians
these
signs
would
have
been
visible
moreover
there
would
have
been
seen
numerous
footsteps
of
indian
women
of
squaws
for
the
of
the
lordly
comanche
is
compelled
to
traverse
the
prairies
loaded
like
the
packhorse
that
follows
at
her
heels
but
though
no
of
indian
women
appeared
there
tracks
of
women
scores
of
them
plainly
imprinted
in
the
soil
of
the
those
slender
impressions
scarcely
a
span
in
length
smoothly
moulded
in
the
mud
were
not
to
be
mistaken
for
the
footsteps
of
an
indian
squaw
there
was
not
the
wide
divergence
at
the
heels
with
the
toes
turned
inward
neither
was
there
the
no
those
tiny
tracks
must
have
been
made
by
women
of
that
nation
who
possess
the
smallest
and
prettiest
feet
in
the
world
by
women
of
mexico
captives
we
exclaimed
as
soon
as
our
eyes
rested
upon
the
tracks
ay
poor
critters
said
rube
sympathisingly
the
cussed
niggurs
hev
made
fut
it
while
thur

wagh
a

poor
gurls
in
sech
kumpny
as
they
got
into
it
ur
a
life
they
got
to
lead
wagh
rube
did
not
reflect
how
heavily
his
words
were
falling
upon
my
heart
there
were
the
tracks
of
more
than
a
hundred
horses
and
as
many
mules
some
of
both
were
but
for
all
that
we
knew
they
had
been
either
ridden
or
driven
by
indians
they
too
were
captives
the
sign
helped
my
companions
to
much
knowledge
that
would
have
been
unintelligible
to
me
it
was
certainly
the
path
of
a
of
indians
the
they
were
laden
with
plunder
and
driving
before
them
or
forcing
to
follow
a
crowd
of
captives
horses
mules
and
women
children
too
for
we
saw
the
tiny
of
tender
age
the
trail
was
significant
of
all
this
even
to
me
but
my
comrades
saw
more
they
no
longer
doubted
that
the
indians
were
comanches
a
moccasin
had
been
picked
up
a
castaway
and
the
leathern
tassel
attached
to
the
heel
declared
the
tribe
to
which
its
wearer
belonged
to
be
the
comanche
the
trail
was
quite
fresh
that
is
but
a
few
hours
had
intervened
since
the
indians
passed
along
it
notwithstanding
the
dryness
of
the
atmosphere
the
mud
on
the
had
not
yet
become
skinned
as
the
trappers
expressed
it
the
indians
had
forded
the
stream
about
the
time
the
prairie
was
set
on
fire
the
horses
we
had
been
following
across
the
burnt
plain
were
those
of
a
party
who
had
gone
out
in
pursuit
of
the
steed
just
at
the
ford
they
had
overtaken
the
main
body
who
carried
along
the
spoil
and
captives
from
that
point
all
had
advanced
together
had
they
done
so
this
was
our
first
object
of
inquiry
it
was
almost
too
probable
to
admit
of
a
doubt
but
we
desired
to
be
certain
about
a
matter
of
such
primary
importance
and
we
looked
for
the
hoof
with
the
piece
chipped
from
its
edge
easily
to
be
identified
by
all
of
us
in
the
muddy
margin
of
the
stream
we
could
not
find
it
but
the
steed
may
have
been
led
or
ridden
in
front
of
the
rest
and
his
tracks
trampled
out
by
the
thick
drove
that
followed
at
this
moment
stanfield
came
up
and
joined
us
in
the
examination
the
ranger
had
scarcely
bent
his
eyes
on
the
trail
when
a
significant
exclamation
escaped
him
he
stood
pointing
downward
to
the
track
of
a
shod
horse
my
horse
cried
he
my
horse

time

capture
such
had
been
rube
advice
overruled
of
course
by
the
more
merciful
of
his
comrades
the
trapper
had
assigned
some
reason
he
knew
something
of
the
man
history
he
now
repeated

the

had

the

who
had

hurried

and
this

ha
strange
remembrances
were
crowding
into
my
brain
i
remembered
meeting
this
skulking
about
the
road
after
we
had
granted
him
his
parole
i
remembered
upon
one
occasion
seeing
him
while
riding
out
with
i
remembered
the
rude
expression
with
which
he
had
regarded
my
companion
the
glance
i
remembered
that
it
made
me
angry
that
i
rebuked
and
threatened
him
i
now
remembered
all
wild
thoughts
came
rushing
into
my
mind
worse
thoughts
than
ever
i
sprang
to
my
saddle
and
calling
out
some
orders
rode
rapidly
along
the
trail
chapter
seventy
seven
the
writing
on
the
maguey
the
skill
of
the
trackers
was
no
longer
called
in
need
the
was
as
easily
followed
as
a
a
blind
man
could
have
guided
himself
along
such
a
highway
our
rate
of
speed
was
now
ruled
by
the
capacity
of
our
horses
alas
their
power
was
nearly
at
an
end
they
had
been
two
days
and
a
night
under
the
saddle
with
but
a
few
hours
to
refresh
themselves
by
food
or
rest
they
could
not
hold
out
much
longer
one
by
one
they
began
to
lag
until
the
greater
number
of
them
followed
with
tottering
step
hundreds
of
yards
in
the
rear
it
was
in
vain
to
contend
against
nature
the
men
were
still
willing
though
they
too
were
wearied
to
death
but
their
horses
were
quite
done
up
even
whip
and
spur
could
force
them
no
farther
only
my
own
matchless
steed
could
have
continued
the
journey
alone
i
might
have
advanced
but
that
would
have
been
madness
what
could
i
have
accomplished
alone
night
was
fast
coming
down
it
was
already
twilight
i
saw
by
the
clouded
sky
we
should
have
no
moon
we
might
follow
the
trail
with
our
waxen
torches
not
yet
burnt
out
but
that
would
no
longer
be
safe
for
myself
i
was
reckless
enough
to
have
risked
life
in
any
way
but
the
lives
of
my
comrades
were
not
mine
i
could
not
give
them
i
should
not
wastefully
fling
them
away
reluctantly
i
glided
from
my
saddle
gave
my
steed
to
the
grass
and
sat
down
upon
the
earth
my
followers
coming
up
said
not
a
word
but
picketing
their
horses
seated
themselves
around
me
one
by
one
they
stretched
themselves
along
the
sward
and
in
ten
minutes
all
were
asleep
i
alone
could
not
sleep
the
fever
of
unrest
was
upon
me
the
demon
of
thought
would
not
let
me
close
my
eyes
though
my
orbs
ached
with
the
long
protracted
vigil
i
thought
that
not
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
world
could
have
given
me
repose
at
that
moment
i
felt
as
one
who
suffers
under
delirium
produced
by
the
intoxicating
cup
the
fearful
i
could
neither
sleep
nor
rest
i
could
not
even
remain
seated
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
wandered
around
without
heed
of
where
i
was
going
i
strode
over
the
recumbent
forms
of
my
sleeping
companions
i
went
among
the
horses
i
paced
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
there
a
stream
a
small
arroyo
or
rivulet
it
was
this
that
had
caused
me
to
halt
in
that
particular
spot
for
wild
as
were
my
thoughts
i
had
enough
of
reason
left
to
know
that
we
could
not
encamp
without
water
the
sight
of
the
arroyo
had
decided
my
wavering
resolution
and
upon
its
banks
almost
mechanically
i
had
drawn
bridle
and
dismounted
i
once
more
descended
to
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
raising
the
water
in
the
palms
of
my
hands
repeatedly
applied
it
to
my
lips
and
temples
the
cool
liquid
refreshed
me
and
seemed
to
soothe
both
my
nerves
and
my
spirit
after
a
time
both
felt
calmer
and
i
sat
down
upon
the
bank
and
watched
for
a
while
the
clear
rivulet
rippling
past
over
its
bed
of
yellow
sand
and
glistening
pebbles
of
quartz
the
water
was
perfectly
diaphanous
and
though
the
sun
was
no
longer
shining
i
could
see
tiny
silver
fish
of
the
genus
sporting
themselves
in
the
lowest
depths
of
the
pool
how
i
envied
them
their
innocent
gambols
their
life
of
crystal
purity
and
freedom
here
in
this
remote
prairie
stream
dwelt
not
the
alligator
nor
the
ravenous
garfish
here
came
no
dolphin
or
shark
to
chase
them
no
tyrant
of
the
waters
to
put
them
in
fear
to
be
envied
indeed
such
an
happy
existence
i
watched
them
for
a
long
while
till
i
thought
that
my
eyes
were
growing
heavy
and
after
all
i
might
seep
the
murmur
of
the
arroyo
helped
to
increase
this
inclination
to
repose
and
perhaps
i
might
have
slept
but
at
that
moment
chancing
to
look
around
my
eyes
rested
upon
an
object
that
again
drove
sleep
far
away
and
i
was
soon
as
wakeful
as
ever
close
to
where
i
had
seated
myself
grew
a
large
plant
of
the
mexican
aloe
it
was
the
wild
maguey
of
course
but
of
a
species
with
broad
fleshy
leaves
of
colour
somewhat
resembling
the
maguey
of
cultivation
i
noticed
that
one
of
the
great
blades
of
the
plant
was
bruised
down
and
the
spine
which
had
terminated
it
torn
off
all
this
would
not
have
drawn
my
attention
i
was
already
aware
that
the
indians
had
made
a
halt
where
we
were
encamped
and
their
sign
was
plenteous
around
in
the
tracks
of
their
animals
and
the
broken
branches
of
trees
one
of
their
horses
or
mules
might
have
munched
at
the
maguey
in
passing
and
viewing
the
bruised
blade
from
a
distance
i
should
have
hazarded
just
such
a
conjecture
but
my
eyes
were
close
to
the
plant
and
to
my
astonishment
i
observed
that
there
writing
upon
the
i
turned
over
upon
my
knees
and
seizing
the
huge
blade
bent
it
down
before
me
so
as
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
its
surface
i
read
by
with
many
and
de
mi
pobres
ninas
from
this
place
saved
from
death
alas
i
the
writing
ended
abruptly
there
was
no
signature
but
it
needed
not
that
i
had
no
doubts
about
who
was
the
writer
in
fact
rude
as
was
the
chirography
from
the
materials
used
i
easily
identified
the
hand
it
was
isolina
de
vargas
who
had
written
i
saw
that
she
had
torn
off
the
terminal
spine
and
using
it
as
a
stylus
had
graven
those
characters
upon
the
epidermis
of
the
plant
sweet
subtle
spirit
under
any
guise
i
could
have
recognised
its
outpourings
saved
from
death
thank
heaven
for
that
alas
i
fear
oh
what
feared
she
was
it
worse
than
death
that
terrible
fate
too
terrible
to
think
of
she
had
broken
off
without
finishing
the
sentence
why
had
she
done
so
the
sheet
was
broad
would
have
held
many
more
words
why
had
she
not
written
more
did
she
dread
to
tell
the
cause
of
her
fear
or
had
she
been
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
some
of
her
tyrant
captors
o
merciful
heaven
save
me
from
thought
i
the
words
over
and
over
there
was
nothing
more
i
examined
the
other
leaves
of
the
plant
on
both
sides
concave
and
convex
i
examined
them
not
a
word
more
could
i
find
what
i
had
read
was
all
she
had
written
chapter
seventy
eight
the
southern
savage
i
need
not
tell
how
deeply
i
was
affected
by
the
unexpected
communication
all
at
once
were
decided
a
variety
of
doubts
all
at
once
was
i
made
aware
of
the
exact
situation
isolina
still
lived
that
was
no
longer
doubtful
and
the
knowledge
produced
joy
more
than
this
she
was
still
uninjured
able
to
think
to
act
to
write
not
only
living
but
well
the
singular
billet
was
proof
of
all
this
another
point
her
hands
must
have
been
free
her
hands
at
least
else
how
could
she
have
traced
those
lines
and
with
such
a
pencil
it
argued
indulgence
perhaps
kind
treatment
on
the
part
of
her
captors
another
point
yet
knew
i
was
in
she
seen
me
then
as
i
galloped
after
it
her
cry
i
had
heard
as
the
steed
dashed
into
the
chapparal
she
had
recognised
me
and
called
back
she
knew
i
would
still
be
following
she
knew
i
was
following
and
for
me
was
the
writing
meant
sweet
subtle
spirit
once
more
i
devoured
the
welcome
words
but
my
heart
grew
heavy
as
i
pondered
over
them
what
had
caused
her
to
break
off
so
abruptly
what
was
it
her
intention
to
have
said
of
what
was
she
in
fear
it
was
thinking
about
this
that
caused
the
heaviness
upon
my
heart
and
forced
me
to
give
way
to
horrid
imaginings
naturally
my
thoughts
reverted
to
her
captors
naturally
i
reflected
upon
the
character
of
the
prairie
savage
so
different
from
that
of
the
forest
indian
opposite
as
is
the
aspect
of
their
homes
and
perhaps
influenced
by
this
very
cause
though
there
are
many
others
climate
contact
with
spanish
civilisation
so
distinct
from
saxon
the
horse
conquest
over
white
foes
concubinage
with
white
and
beautiful
women
the
daughters
of
the
race
of
cortez
all
these
have
combined
to
produce
in
the
southern
indian
a
spiritual
existence
that
more
resembles
andalusia
than
england
more
like
mexico
than
boston
or
new
york
psychologically
speaking
there
is
not
so
much
difference
between
paris
and
the
prairies
between
the
of
the
bal
mabille
and
the
of
the

of

these
were
not
imaginings
they
were
not
fancies
begot
in
my
own
brain
would
they
had
been
so
too
well
did
i
know
they
were
facts
horrid
realities
can
you
wonder
that
sleep
was
shaken
from
my
eyelids
that
i
could
not
think
of
rest
or
stay
till
i
had
delivered
my
loved
one
my
betrothed
from
the
danger
of
such
a
destiny
all
thought
of
sleep
was
banished
even
weariness
forsook
me
i
felt
fresh
as
if
i
had
slept
my
nerves
were
strung
for
emprise
it
was
but
the
excitement
renewed
by
what
i
had
read
the
impatience
of
a
new
and
keen
apprehension
i
would
have
mounted
and
gone
forward
spurning
rest
and
sleep
regardless
of
danger
would
i
have
followed
but
what
could
i
do
alone
ay
and
what
with
my
few
followers
ha
i
had
not
thought
of
this
up
to
that
moment
i
had
not
put
this
important
question
and
i
had
need
to
reflect
upon
the
answer
what
if
we
should
overtake
this
band
of
brigands
as
they
were
and
cumbered
with
captives
surely
we
could
come
up
with
them
by
night
or
by
day
but
what
then
ay
what
then
there
were
nine
of
us
and
we
were
in
pursuit
of
a
of
at
least
one
hundred
in
number
one
hundred
braves
armed
and
equipped
for
battle
the
choice
warriors
of
their
tribe
flushed
with
late
success
and
vengeful
against
ourselves
on
account
of
former
defeat
if
conquered
we
need
look
for
no
mercy
at
their
hands
conquered
how
could
it
be
otherwise
nine
against
a
hundred
how
could
conquer
up
to
this
moment
i
say
i
had
not
thought
of
the
result
i
was
borne
along
by
only
one
impulse
the
idea
of
overtaking
the
steed
and
rescuing
his
rider
from
her
perilous
situation
it
was
only
within
the
hour
that
her
peril
had
assumed
a
new
phase
only
an
hour
since
we
had
learned
that
she
had
escaped
from
one
danger
to
be
brought
within
the
influence
of
another
at
first
had
i
felt
joy
but
the
feeling
was
of
short
existence
for
i
now
recognised
in
the
new
situation
a
greater
peril
than
that
she
had
outlived
she
had
been
rescued
from
death
to
become
the
victim
of
dishonour
chapter
seventy
nine
a
subterranean
fire
in
the
midst
of
my
meditations
night
descended
upon
the
earth
it
promised
to
be
a
moonless
night
a
robe
of
sable
clouds
formed
a
sombre
lining
to
the
sky
and
through
this
neither
moon
nor
stars
were
visible
it
grew
darker
apace
until
in
the
dim
light
i
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
forms
of
my
companions
neither
men
nor
horses
though
both
were
near
me
the
men
were
still
asleep
stretched
along
the
grass
in
various
attitudes
like
so
many
bodies
upon
a
the
horses
were
too
hungry
to
sleep
the
constant
told
that
they
were
greedily
browsing
upon
the
sward
of
that
by
good
fortune
grew
luxuriantly
around
this
would
be
the
best
rest
for
them
and
i
was
glad
to
think
that
this
splendid
provender
would
in
a
few
hours
recruit
their
strength
it
was
the
the
favourite
food
of
horses
and
cattle
and
in
its
effects
upon
their
condition
almost
equal
to
the
bean
or
the
oat
i
knew
it
would
soon
freshen
the
jaded
animals
and
make
them
ready
for
the
road
at
least
in
this
there
was
some
consolation
notwithstanding
the
of
my
thoughts
i
began
to
be
sensible
of
a
physical
discomfort
which
despite
their
low
latitude
is
often
experienced
upon
the
southern
prairies
cold
a
chill
breeze
had
set
in
with
the
night
which
in
became
a
strong
and
violent
wind
increasing
in
coldness
as
in
strength
in
that
the
thermometer
must
have
fallen
at
least
fifty
fahrenheit
degrees
and
such
a
phenomenon
is
not
rare
upon
the
plains
of
texas
the
wind
was
the
which
often
kills
both
men
and
animals
that
chance
to
be
exposed
to
its
icy
breath
i
have
endured
the
rigour
of
a
canadian
winter
have
crossed
the
frozen
lakes
have
slept
upon
a
amidst
the
wild
wastes
of
land
but
i
can
not
remember
cold
more
intensely
chilling
than
that
i
have
suffered
in
a
texan
norther
this
extreme
does
not
arise
from
the
absolute
depression
of
the
thermometer
which
at
least
is
but
a
poor
indicator
of
either
heat
or
cold
i
mean
the
sensation
of
either
it
is
more
probably
the
contrast
springing
from
the
sudden
change
the
exposure
the
absence
of
proper
clothing
or
shelter
the
state
of
the
blood
and
other
like
circumstances
that
cause
both
heat
and
cold
to
be
more
sensibly
felt
i
had
ofttimes
experienced
the
chill
blast
of
the
norther
but
never
more
acutely
than
upon
that
night
the
day
had
been
sweltering
hot
the
thermometer
at
noon
ranging
about
the
fahrenheit
degree
while
in
the
first
hour
of
darkness
it
could
not
have
been
far
above
the
twentieth
had
i
judged
by
my
sensations
i
should
have
put
it
even
lower
certainly
it
had
passed
the
and
sharp
sleet
and
hail
were
borne
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
with
nerves
deranged
from
want
of
rest
and
sleep
after
the
hot
march
after
the
perspiration
produced
by
long
exposure
upon
the
heated
surface
of
the
burnt
prairie
i
perhaps
felt
the
cold
more
acutely
than
i
should
otherwise
have
done
my
blood
seemed
to
stagnate
and
freeze
within
my
veins
i
was
fain
to
wrap
around
my
body
a
which
some
careless
savage
had
dropped
upon
the
trail
my
followers
were
not
so
well
furnished
starting
as
we
had
done
without
any
thought
of
being
absent
for
the
night
no
preparation
had
been
made
for
camping
out
only
a
portion
of
them
chanced
to
have
their
blankets
strapped
upon
the
cantles
of
their
saddles
these
were
now
the
fortunate
ones
the
norther
had
roused
all
of
them
from
their
slumbers
had
awaked
them
as
suddenly
as
a
douche
of
cold
water
would
have
done
and
one
and
all
were
groping
about
in
the
darkness
some
seeking
for
their
blankets
others
for
such
shelter
as
was
afforded
by
the
of
the
bushes
fortunately
there
were
some
and
these
were
soon
dragged
from
the
backs
of
the
horses
the
poor
brutes
themselves
suffered
equally
with
their
owners
they
stood
cowering
under
the
cold
with
their
hips
to
the
cutting
blast
their
limbs
drawn
close
together
and
their
flanks
shaggy
and
shivering
some
of
them
half
sheltered
themselves
behind
the
bushes
scarce
caring
to
touch
the
grass
at
their
feet
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
make
a
fire
there
was
dry
wood
in
plenty
near
the
spot
and
of
the
best
kind
for
burning
the
large
species
of
mezquite
some
of
the
men
were
for
kindling
fires
at
once
regardless
of
consequences
but
this
design
was
overruled
by
the
more
prudent
of
the
party
the
trappers
were
strongly
against
it
cold
as
was
the
night
and
dark
they
knew
that
neither
the
norther
nor
the
darkness
would
deter
indians
from
being
abroad
a
party
might
be
out
upon
the
prowl
the
very
we
had
picked
up
might
bring
a
squad
of
them
back
for
it
was
the
grand
robe
of
some
brave
or
chief
whose
whole
was
delineated
in
hieroglyphical
painting
upon
its
inner
surface
to
have
made
a
fire
might
have
cost
us
our
lives
so
alleged
the
trappers
rube
and
garey
it
would
be
better
to
endure
the
cold
than
risk
our
scalps
so
counselled
they
but
for
all
that
rube
had
no
idea
of
being
starved
to
death
he
could
kindle
a
fire
and
burn
it
upon
an
open
prairie
without
the
least
fear
of
its
being
seen
and
in
a
few
minutes
time
he
had
succeeded
in
making
one
that
could
not
have
been
discovered
by
the
most
indian
in
creation
i
had
watched
the
operation
with
some
interest
he
first
collected
a
quantity
of
dead
leaves
dry
grass
and
short
sticks
of
the
all
of
which
he
placed
under
his
to
prevent
the
rain
and
sleet
from
wetting
them
this
done
he
drew
out
his
and
with
the
blade
crowed
a
hole
into
the
turf
about
a
foot
deep
and
ten
inches
or
a
foot
in
diameter
in
the
bottom
of
this
hole
he
placed
the
grass
and
leaves
having
first
ignited
them
by
means
of
his
flint
steel
and
punk
tinder
all
of
which
implements
formed
part
of
the
contents
of
rube
pouch
and
possible
sack
ever
present
on
the
top
of
the
now
blazing
leaves
and
grass
he
placed
the
dry
sticks
first
the
smaller
ones
and
then
those
of
larger
dimensions
until
the
hole
was
filled
up
to
the
brim
and
over
all
he
laid
the
piece
of
sod
originally
cut
from
the
surface
and
which
fitted
as
neatly
as
a
lid
his
furnace
being
now
finished
and
in
full
blast
the
old
trapper
hunkered
down
close
to
its
edge
in
such
a
position
as
to
embrace
the
fire
between
his
thighs
and
have
it
nearly
under
him
he
then
drew
his
old
over
his
shoulders
allowing
it
to
droop
behind
until
he
had
secured
it
under
the
salient
points
of
his
lank
angular
hips
in
front
he
passed
the
blanket
over
his
knees
until
both
ends
reaching
the
ground
were
gripped
tightly
between
his
toes
the
contrivance
was
complete
and
there
sat
the
earless
trapper
like
a
over
a
plant
of
spring
rhubarb
a
slight
smoke
oozing
through
the
apertures
of
the
scant
blanket
and
curling
up
around
his
ears
as
though
he
was
hatching
upon
a
hotbed
but
no
fire
could
be
seen
though
rube
shivered
no
longer
he
soon
found
imitators
garey
had
already
constructed
a
similar
furnace
and
the
others
were
soon
warming
themselves
by
this
simple
but
ingenious
device
i
did
not
disdain
to
avail
myself
of
the
extra
shaft
which
the
garey
had
sunk
for
my
accommodation
and
having
placed
myself
by
its
side
and
drawn
the
ample
robe
over
my
shoulders
i
felt
as
warm
as
if
seated
in
front
of
a
fire
under
other
circumstances
i
might
have
joined
in
the
merriment
produced
among
my
companions
by
the
ludicrous
spectacle
which
we
presented
a
comic
spectacle
indeed
nine
of
us
squatted
at
intervals
over
the
ground
the
blue
smoke
escaping
through
the
interstices
of
our
robes
and
blankets
and
rising
around
our
heads
as
though
one
and
all
of
us
were
on
fire
wind
sleet
and
darkness
continued
throughout
the
whole
night
cold
wind
sharp
icy
sleet
and
black
darkness
that
seemed
palpable
to
the
touch
ever
so
eager
ever
so
fresh
we
could
not
have
advanced
along
the
trail
grand
as
it
was
it
could
not
have
been
traced
under
that
amorphous
obscurity
and
we
had
no
means
of
carrying
a
light
even
had
it
been
safe
to
do
so
we
had
no
lantern
and
the
norther
with
one
blast
would
have
whisked
out
a
torch
of
we
thought
no
more
of
going
forward
until
either
the
day
should
break
or
the
wind
come
to
a
lull
at
midnight
we
replenished
our
subterranean
fires
and
remained
on
the
ground
hail
rain
wind
and
darkness
my
companions
rested
their
heads
upon
their
knees
or
nodding
slept
no
sleep
for
me
not
even
the
repose
of
thought
like
some
fevered
sufferer
on
his
wakeful
couch
i
counted
the
hours
the
minutes
the
minutes
seemed
hours
rain
hail
sleet
and
wind
seemed
like
darkness
itself
to
belong
to
the
night
as
long
as
night
lasted
so
long
continued
they
when
it
came
to
an
end
all
vanished
together
the
norther
had
exhausted
its
strength
a
wild
turkey
killed
before
nightfall
with
some
steaks
of
the
furnished
us
with
an
ample
breakfast
it
was
hastily
cooked
and
hastily
eaten
and
as
the
first
streak
of
dawn
appeared
along
the
horizon
we
were
in
our
saddles
and
advancing
upon
the
trail
chapter
eighty
a
red
epistle
the
trail
led
as
written
upon
the
maguey
no
doubt
isolina
had
heard
her
captors
forespeak
their
plans
i
knew
that
she
herself
understood
something
of
the
comanche
language
the
accomplishment
may
appear
strange
and
not
strange
either
when
it
is
known
that
her
mother
could
have
spoken
it
well
with
her
it
was
a
but
even
without
this
knowledge
she
might
still
have
learned
the
designs
of
the
savages
for
these
southern
comanches
are
accomplished
linguists
many
of
them
can
speak
the
beautiful
language
of
andalusia
there
was
a
time
when
a
portion
of
the
tribe
submitted
to
the
teaching
of
the
mission
padres
besides
a
few
among
them
might
boast
which
they
do
not
of
iberian
blood
no
doubt
then
that
the
captive
in
their
midst
had
overheard
them
discussing
their
projects
we
had
ridden
about
two
hours
when
we
came
upon
the
ground
where
the
indians
had
made
their
we
approached
it
warily
and
with
stealth
for
we
were
now
travelling
with
great
caution
we
had
need
should
a
single
savage
straggling
behind
set
eyes
upon
us
we
might
as
well
be
seen
by
the
whole
band
if
discovered
upon
the
our
lives
would
not
be
worth
much
some
of
us
might
escape
but
even
if
all
of
us
survived
our
plan
would
be
completely
frustrated
i
say
plan
for
i
had
formed
one
during
the
long
vigil
of
the
night
my
thoughts
had
not
been
idle
and
a
course
of
action
i
had
traced
out
though
it
was
not
yet
fully
developed
in
my
mind
circumstances
might
yet
alter
it
or
aid
me
in
its
execution
we
approached
their
then
warily
and
with
stealth
the
smoke
of
its
smouldering
fires
pointed
out
the
place
and
warned
us
from
afar
we
found
it
quite
deserted
the
gaunt
wolf
and
coyote
alone
occupying
the
ground
disputing
with
each
other
possession
of
the
hide
and
bones
of
a
horse
the
debris
of
the
indian
breakfast
had
we
not
known
already
the
trappers
could
have
told
by
the
sign
of
the
camp
to
what
tribe
the
indians
belonged
there
were
still
standing
the
poles
of
a
tent
only
one
doubtless
the
lodge
of
the
head
chief
the
poles
were
temporary
ones
saplings
cut
from
the
adjacent
thicket
they
were
placed
in
a
circle
and
meeting
at
the
top
were
tied
together
with
a
piece
of
thong
so
that
when
covered
the
lodge
would
have
exhibited
the
form
of
a
perfect
cone
this
we
knew
was
the
fashion
of

clairvoyance
extended
further
the
savages
had
been
astart
as
early
as
ourselves
they
had
decamped
about
daylight
and
were
now
exactly
two
hours
ahead
of
us
on
the
trail
why
were
they
travelling
so
rapidly
not
from
fear
of
pursuit
by
any
enemy
the
soldiers
of
mexico
had
these
been
regarded
by
them
were
too
busy
with
the
saxon
foe
and
they
could
hardly
be
expecting
upon
an
expedition
to
rob
them
of
their
captives
perhaps
they
were
driving
forward
to
be
in
time
for
the
great
herds
of
buffalo
that
along
with
the
cold
northers
might
now
be
looked
for
in
the
higher
latitudes
of
the
comanche
range
this
was
the
explanation
given
by
the
trappers
most
probably
the
true
one
under
the
influence
of
singular
emotions
i
rode
over
the
ground
there
were
other
signs
besides
those
of
the
savage
signs
of
the
plunder
with
which
they
were
laden
signs
of
civilisation
there
were
fragments
of
broken
cups
and
musical
instruments
torn
leaves
of
books
remnants
of
dresses
silks
and
velvets
a
small
satin
slipper
the
peculiar
of
the
mexican
manola
side
by
side
with
a
moccasin
fit
emblems
of
savage
and
civilised
life
there
was
no
time
for
speculating
on
so
curious
a
confusion
i
was
looking
for
signs
of
her
for
traces
of
my
betrothed
i
cast
around
me
inquiring
glances
where
was
it
probable
she
had
passed
the
night
where
involuntarily
my
eyes
rested
upon
the
naked
poles
the
tent
of
the
chief
how
could
it
be
otherwise
who
among
all
the
captives
like
her
grandly
beautiful
to
satisfy
the
eye
even
of
a
savage
chieftain
grandly
magnificently
beautiful
how
could
she
escape
his
notice
there
in
his
lodge
shrouded
under
the
brown
skins
of
buffaloes
under
hideous
devices
in
the
arms
of
a
painted
savage

for

the
object
which
he
held
between
his
fingers
had
more
interest
for
me
than
either
the
history
of
his
own
early
days
or
the
story
of
the
betrayal
it
was
a
paper
a
note
actually
folded
and
addressed
warfield
he
had
found
it
upon
the
grass
close
to
where
the
tent
had
stood
where
it
was
held
in
the
crotch
of
a
split
reed
the
other
end
of
which
was
sticking
in
the
ground
no
wonder
the
trapper
had
remarked
upon
the
ink
there
was
no
mistaking
the
character
of
that
livid
red
the
writing
was
hastily
unfolding
the
paper
i
read
i
am
still
safe
but
in
dread
of
a
sad
fate
of
the
poor
white
captive
among
these
hideous
men
last
night
i
feared
it
but
the
virgin
shielded
me
it
has
not
come
oh
i
shall
not
shall
die
by
my

hand
a
strange
chance
has
hitherto
saved
me
from
this
horrid
outrage
no
it
was
not
chance
but
heaven
that
interposed
it
is
thus
two
of
my
captors
claim
the
son
of

whom
you
granted

freedom

of
the
steed
therefore
both
claim
me
as
their
property
the
claim
is
not
yet
adjusted
hence
have
i
been
spared
but
alas
i
fear
my
hour
is
nigh
a
council
is
to
be
held
that
will
decide
to
which
of
these
monsters
i
am
to
be
given
if
to
either
it
is
a
horrid
fate
if
to
neither
a
doom
still
more
horrible
perchance
you
know
their
custom
i
should
be
common
victim
of
all
dios
de
mi
alma
not
henri
lord
of
my
heart
fear
not
that
i
shall
dishonour
your
love
in
my
breast
its
purity
shall
be
preserved
even
at
the
sacrifice
of
my
life
i
shall
bathe
it
with
my
blood
ah
me
my
heart
is
bleeding
now
they
come
to
drag
me
away
farewell
such
were
the
contents
of
the
page
the
of
a
torn
missal
upon
the
other
side
was
a
vignette
a
picture
of
dolores
the
weeping
saint
of
mexico
had
it
been
chosen
the
emblem
could
scarcely
have
been
more
appropriate
i
thrust
the
red
writing
into
my
bosom
and
without
waiting
to
exchange
a
word
with
my
companions
pressed
forward
upon
the
trail
chapter
eighty
one
more
writing
in
red
the
men
followed
as
before
we
needed
no
trackers
to
point
out
the
way
the
path
was
plain
as
a
drover
road
a
thousand
hoofs
had
made
their
mark
upon
the
ground
we
rode
at
a
regular
pace
not
rapidly
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
come
up
with
the
savages
i
desired
to
get
sight
of
them
just
after
nightfall
not
before
lest
they
might
also
get
sight
of
us
the
plan
i
proposed
to
myself
for
the
rescue
of
my
betrothed
could
not
be
accomplished
in
the
daytime
darkness
alone
could
avail
me
in
carrying
it
out
and
for
nightfall
must
i
wait
we
could
easily
have
overtaken
the
indians
before
night
they
were
but
two
short
hours
in
the
advance
of
us
and
would
be
certain
as
is
their
custom
on
the
to
make
a
of
several
hours
duration
even
indian
horses
require
to
be
rested
we
calculated
the
rate
at
which
they
were
travelling
how
many
miles
to
the
hour
the
could
tell
to
a
furlong
both
the
gait
and
the
distance
the
tracks
of
the
poor
captives
were
still
seen
along
the
trail
this
showed
that
the
party
could
not
have
been
going
faster
than
a
walk
the
alleged
there
were
many
horses
without
riders
led
or
driven
many
mules
too
the
product
of
the
foray
why
were
the
poor
captives
not
permitted
to
ride
them
was
it
sheer
cruelty
or
brutal
indifference
on
the
part
of
their
captors
did
the
inhuman
monsters
gloat
over
the
sufferings
of
these
unfortunates
and
deny
them
even
the
alleviation
of
physical
pain
the
affirmative
answer
to
all
these
questions
was
probably
the
true
one
since
hardly
better
no
better
indeed
is
the
behaviour
of
these
savages
towards
the
women
of
their
own
blood
and
kind
their
own
squaws
talk
not
to
me
of
the
noble
savage
of
the
simplicity
and
gentleness
of
that
condition
falsely
termed
a
state
of
nature
it
is
not
nature
god
meant
not
man
to
be
a
wild
ishmaelite
on
the
face
of
the
earth
man
was
made
for
civilisation
for
society
and
only
under
its
influence
does
he
assume
the
form
and
grace
of
true
nobility
leave
him
to
himself
to
the
play
of
his
instincts
to
the
indulgence
of
his
evil
impulses
and
man
becomes
a
brute
a
beast
of
prey
even
worse
for
wolf
and
tiger
gently
consort
with
their
kind
and
still
more
gently
with
their
family
they
feel
the
tenderness
of
the
family
tie
where
is
the
savage
upon
all
the
earth
who
does
not
usurp
dominion
and
practise
the
meanest
tyranny
over
his
weaker
mate
where
can
you
find
him
not
on
the
karoos
of
africa
not
upon
the
of
the
amazon
not
by
the
icy
shores
of
the
arctic
sea
certainly
not
upon
the
prairies
of
north
america
no
man
can
be
noble
who
would
in
wrath
lay
his
finger
upon
weaker
woman
talk
not
then
of
the
noble
savage
fancy
of
poets
myth
of
romancers
the
tracks
of
riderless
horses
the
footsteps
of
walking
women
tender
girls
and
children
upon
that
long
tiresome
trail
had
for
me
a
cruel
significance
those
slender
tiny
tracks
of
pretty
feet
there
was
one
that
fixed
my
attention
more
than
the
rest
every
now
and
then
my
eyes
were
upon
it
i
fancied
i
could
identify
it
it
was
exactly
the
size
i
thought
the
perfect
symmetry
and
configuration
the
oval
curve
of
the
heel
the
high
instep
the
row
of
small
graduated
globes
made
by
the
impression
of
the
toes
the
smooth
surface
left
by
the
imprint
of
the
delicate
epidermis
all
these
points
seemed
to
characterise
the
footprint
of
a
lady
surely
it
could
not
be
hers
oh
surely
she
would
not
be
toiling
along
that
weary
track
cruel
as
were
the
hearts
of
her
captors
brutal
as
were
their
natures
surely
they
would
not
inflict
this
unnecessary
pain
beauty
like
hers
should
command
kinder
treatment
should
inspire
compassion
even
in
the
breast
of
a
savage
alas
i
deemed
it
doubtful
we
rode
slowly
on
as
already
said
not
desirous
of
yet
overtaking
the
foe
we
were
allowing
them
time
to
depart
from
their
noon
we
might
have
stopped
there
a
while
longer
but
i
could
not
submit
to
the
repose
of
a
halt
motion
however
slow
appeared
progress
and
in
some
measure
hindered
me
from
dwelling
upon
thoughts
that
only
produced
unnecessary
pain
notwithstanding
the
incumbrance
of
their
spoils
the
indians
must
have
been
travelling
faster
than
we
they
had
no
fear
of
foes
to
retard
them
nought
to
require
either
spies
or
caution
they
were
now
in
their
own
country
in
the
very
heart
of
the
comanche
range
and
in
dread
of
no
enemy
they
were
moving
freely
and
without
fear
we
on
the
contrary
had
to
keep
our
scouts
in
the
advance
every
bend
of
the
road
had
to
be
reconnoitred
by
them
every
bush
examined
every
rise
of
the
ground
approached
with
extreme
care
and
watchfulness
these
manoeuvres
occupied
time
and
we
moved
slowly
enough
it
was
after
when
we
arrived
at
the
of
the
savages
the
smoke
as
before
warned
us
and
approaching
under
cover
we
perceived
that
they
were
gone
they
had
kindled
fires
and
cooked
flesh
the
bones
clean
picked
were
easily
identified
and
the
meal
showed
that
there
had
been
no
change
in
the
diet
of
these
hippophagists
dinner
and
dejeuner
had
been
alike
drawn
from
the
same
larder
again
i
searched
the
ground
but
as
before
the
eyes
of
the
trapper
proved
better
than
mine
hyur
a
other
young
fellur
said
he
handing
me
the
paper
another
leaf
from
the
missal
i
seized
it
eagerly
eagerly
i
devoured
its
contents
this
time
they
were
more
brief
more
i
open
my
veins
the
council
meets
in
a
few
hours
it
will
be
decided
whose
property
i
am
whose
slave
whose
santissima
maria
i
can
not
write
the
word
i
shall
attempt
to
escape
they
leave
my
hands
free
but
my
limbs
are
tightly
bound
i
have
tried
to
undo
my
fastenings
but
can
not
o
if
i
but
had
a
knife
i
know
where
one
is
kept
i
may
contrive
to
seize
it
but
it
must
be
in
the
last
moment
it
will
not
do
to
fail
henri
i
am
firm
and
resolute
i
do
not
yield
to
despair
one
way
or
the
other
i
shall
free
myself
from
the
hideous
embrace
of
they
come
the
villain
watches
me
i
the
writing
ended
abruptly
her
jailers
had
suddenly
approached
the
paper
had
evidently
been
concealed
from
them
in
haste
it
had
been
crumpled
up
and
flung
upon
the
grass
for
so
was
it
when
found
we
remained
for
a
while
upon
the
spot
to
rest
and
refresh
our
horses
the
poor
brutes
needed
both
there
was
water
at
the
place
and
that
might
not
be
met
with
again
the
sun
was
far
down
when
we
resumed
our
march
last
march
along
the
chapter
eighty
two
an
injun
on
the
we
had
advanced
about
a
mile
farther
when
our
scouts
who
as
usual
had
gone
forward
to
reconnoitre
having
ascended
a
swell
of
the
prairie
were
observed
crouching
behind
some
bushes
that
grew
upon
its
crest
we
all
drew
bridle
to
await
the
result
of
their
reconnoissance
the
peculiar
attitude
in
which
they
had
placed
themselves
and
the
apparent
earnestness
with
which
they
glanced
over
the
bushes
led
us
to
believe
that
some
object
was
before
their
eyes
of
more
than
common
interest
so
it
proved
we
had
scarcely
halted
when
they
were
seen
to
retire
suddenly
from
the
cover
and
rising
erect
run
at
full
speed
back
down
the
hill
at
the
same
time
making
signals
to
us
to
conceal
ourselves
in
the
timber
fortunately
there
was
timber
near
and
in
a
few
seconds
we
had
all
ridden
into
it
taking
the
horses
of
the
trappers
along
with
us
the
declivity
of
the
hill
enabled
the
scouts
to
run
with
swiftness
and
they
were
among
the
trees
almost
as
soon
as
we
what
is
it
inquired
several
in
the
same
breath

the
replied
the
panting
trappers

how
many
of
them
naturally
asked

of
the
rangers
who
slayed

the
pithy
chapter
of
instructions
above
detailed
was
delivered
in
far
less
time
than
it
takes
to
read
it
the
speaker
never
paused
till
he
had
uttered
the
final
emphatic
expression
which
was
one
of
his
favourite
phrases
of
embellishment
at
the
same
instant
i
saw
just
appearing
above
the
crest
of
the
ridge
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
savage
in
a
few
seconds
more
the
body
rose
in
sight
and
then
the
thighs
and
legs
with
a
large
piebald
mustang
between
them
i
need
scarcely
add
that
the
horse
was
going
at
a
gallop
it
is
a
rare
sight
when
a
rides
any
other
gait
there
was
only
one
the
scouts
were
sure
of
this
beyond
the
swell
stretched
an
open
prairie
and
if
the
indian
had
had
companions
or
followers
they
would
have
been
seen
he
was
alone
what
had
brought
him
back
on
the
trail
was
he
upon
the
scout
no
he
was
riding
without
thought
and
without
precaution
a
scout
would
have
acted
otherwise
he
might
have
been
a
messenger
but
whither
bound
surely
the
indians
had
left
no
party
in
our
rear
quickly
these
inquiries
passed
among
us
and
quick
conjectures
were
offered
in
answer
the
voyageur
gave
the
most
probable
solution
pe
gar
he
go

for

what

mon

the
explanation
was
understood
le
blanc
had
observed
a
shield
among
the
bushes
where
we
had
halted
like
enough
left
behind
by
some
of
the
braves
it
was
garnished
with
scalps
fresh
mexican
scalps
like
enough
the
indian
had
forgotten
both
his
armour
and
his
trophies
he
was
on
his
way
to
recover
them
like
enough
there
was
no
time
either
for
further
talk
or
conjecture
the
red
horseman
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
in
ten
seconds
more
he
would
be
lazoed
or
shot
garey
and
i
placed
ourselves
on
opposite
sides
of
the
path
both
with
our
lazoes
coiled
and
ready
the
trapper
was
an
adept
in
the
use
of
this
singular
weapon
and
i
too
understood
something
of
its
management
the
trees
were
in
our
way
and
would
have
prevented
the
proper
winding
of
it
but
it
was
our
intention
to
spur
clear
of
the
timber
the
moment
the
indian
came
within
range
and
rope
him
on
the
run
rube
crouched
behind
garey
rifle
in
hand
and
the
rangers
were
also
ready
in
case
both
the
lazoes
and
rube
rifle
should
miss
it
would
not
do
to
let
the
indian
either
go
on
or
go
back
in
either
case
he
would
us
should
he
pass
the
spot
where
we
were
he
would
observe
our
tracks
in
a
minute
time
even
amidst
the
thousands
of
others
and
would
be
certain
to
return
by
another
route
should
he
escape
from
us
and
gallop
away
still
worse
he
must
not
be
permitted
either
to
go
on
or
go
back
he
must
be
captured
or
killed
for
my
part
i
desired
that
the
former
should
be
his
destiny
i
had
no
feeling
of
revenge
to
gratify
by
taking
the
life
of
this
red
man
and
had
his
capture
not
been
absolutely
necessary
to
our
own
safety
i
should
willingly
have
let
him
come
and
go
as
he
listed
some
of
my
comrades
were
actuated
by
very
different
motives
killing
a
comanche
indian
was
by
their
creed
no
greater
crime
than
killing
a
wolf
a
panther
or
a
grizzly
bear
and
it
was
not
from
any
motives
of
mercy
that
the
trapper
had
cautioned
the
others
to
hold
their
fire
prudence
alone
dictated
the
advice
he
had
given
his
reason
the
reports
of
our
guns
might
be
heard
through
the
leaves
i
looked
upon
the
horseman
as
he
advanced
a
fellow
he
was
no
doubt
one
of
the
distinguished
warriors
of
his
tribe
what
his
face
was
i
could
not
see
for
the
disfigured
it
with
a
hideous
mask
but
his
body
was
large
his
chest
broad
and
full
his
limbs
symmetrical
and
well
turned
to
the
very
toes
he
sat
his
horse
like
a
centaur
i
had
no
opportunity
for
prolonged
observation
without
hesitating
the
indian
galloped
up
i
sprang
my
horse
clear
of
the
timber
i
wound
the
lazo
around
my
head
and
hurled
it
towards
him
i
saw
the
noose
settling
over
his
shoulders
and
falling
down
to
his
hips
i
spurred
in
the
opposite
direction
i
felt
the
quick
jerk
and
the
taut
rope
told
me
i
had
secured
the
victim
i
turned
in
my
saddle
and
glanced
back
i
saw
the
rope
of
garey
around
the
neck
of
the
indian
mustang
tightened
and
holding
him
fast
horse
and
horseman
both
were
ours
chapter
eighty
three
my
plan
the
savage
did
not
yield
himself
up
without
resistance
resistance
with
an
indian
is
instinctive
as
with
a
wild
animal
he
flung
himself
from
his
horse
and
drawing
his
knife
with
a
single
cut
severed
the
thong
that
bound
him
in
another
instant
he
would
have
been
off
among
the
bushes
but
before
he
could
move
from
the
spot
strong
arms
were
around
him
and
in
spite
of
his
struggles
and
the
dangerous
thrusts
of
his
long
spanish
knife
he
was
choked
down
and
held
fast
my
followers
were
for
making
short
work
with
him
more
than
one
had
bared
their
blades
to
finish
him
upon
the
spot
and
would
have
done
so
had
i
not
interfered
i
was
averse
to
spilling
his
blood
and
by
my
intercession
his
life
was
spared
to
prevent
him
from
giving
us
further
trouble
however
we
tied
him
to
a
tree
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
not
possibly
free
himself
the
mode
of
securing
him
was
suggested
by
stanfield
the
backwoodsman
it
was
simple
and
safe
a
tree
was
chosen
whose
trunk
was
large
enough
to
fill
the
embrace
of
the
indian
so
that
the
ends
of
his
fingers
just
met
when
his
arms
were
drawn
to
their
full
stretch
around
it
upon
his
wrists
thongs
of
raw
hide
were
firmly
looped
and
then
knotted
together
his
ankles
were
also
bound
by
similar
cords
the
ends
of
which
were
staked
so
as
to
hinder
him
from
worming
around
the
tree
and
perchance
wearing
off
his
thongs
or
chafing
them
so
that
they
might
break
the
ligature
was
perfect
the
most
expert
could
not
have
freed
himself
from
such
a
fastening
it
was
our
intention
to
leave
him
thus
and
set
him
free
upon
our
return
if
we
should
return
by
that
way
a
doubtful
hypothesis
i
thought
not
at
the
time
of
the
cruelty
we
were
committing
we
had
spared
the
indian
life
a
mercy
at
the
moment
and
i
was
too
much
concerned
about
the
future
of
others
to
waste
reflection
on
his
we
had
taken
the
precaution
to
leave
him
at
some
distance
from
the
place
of
his
capture
others
of
his
party
might
come
after
and
discover
him
soon
enough
to
interfere
with
our
plans
his
prison
had
been
chosen
far
off
in
the
depth
of
the
woods
even
his
shouts
could
not
have
been
heard
by
any
one
passing
along
the
trail
he
was
not
to
be
left
entirely
alone
a
horse
was
to
be
his
companion
not
his
own
for
one
of
the
rangers
had
fancied
an
exchange
stanfield
not
well
mounted
had
proposed
a
swop
as
he
jocosely
termed
it
to
which
the
savage
had
no
alternative
but
consent
and
the
kentuckian
having
hitched
his
nag
to
a
tree
led
off
the
mustang
in
triumph
declaring
that
he
was
now
squar
wi
the
indyens
stanfield
would
have
liked
it
better
had
the
swop
been
made
with
the
renegade
who
had
robbed
him
we
were
about
to
leave
the
place
and
move
on
when
a
bright
idea
suddenly
came
into
my
head
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
too
might
effect
a
profitable
exchange
with
our
captive
a
swop
not
of
horses
but
of
men
in
short
an
exchange
of
persons
of
identities
in
truth
a
bright
idea
it
was
and
one
that
promised
well
i
have
said
that
i
had
already
conceived
a
plan
for
the
rescue
of
my
betrothed
i
had
done
so
during
the
night
and
all
along
the
route
in
my
mind
i
had
been
maturing
it
the
incident
that
had
just
transpired
had
given
rise
to
a
host
of
new
ideas
one
above
all
that
promised
to
aid
me
in
facilitating
the
execution
of
my
design
the
capture
of
the
savage
which
had
at
first
given
me
uneasiness
i
now
regarded
in
a
very
different
light
as
a
fortunate
circumstance
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
i
recognised
in
it
the
finger
of
providence
and
the
thought
inspired
me
with
hope
i
felt
that
i
was
not
forsaken
the
plan
i
had
proposed
to
myself
was
simple
enough
it
would
require
more
of
courage
than
stratagem
but
to
the
former
i
was
sufficiently
nerved
by
the
desperate
circumstances
in
which
we
had
become
involved
i
proposed
to
enter
the
indian
camp
in
the
night
of
course
by
stealth
and
under
cover
of
the
darkness
to
find
the
captive
if
possible
set
her
limbs
free
and
then
trust
to
chance
for
the
escape
of
both
of
us
if
once
inside
the
encampment
and
within
reach
of
her
a
sudden
might
accomplish
all
this
success
was
not
beyond
possibility
nor
probability
neither
and
the
circumstances
admitted
of
no
plan
that
promised
so
fairly
to
have
attempted
fight
with
my
few
followers
against
such
a
host
to
have
attacked
the
indian
camp
even
under
the
advantage
of
an
alarm
would
have
been
sheer
madness
it
must
have
resulted
not
only
in
our
immediate
defeat
but
would
have
destroyed
our
last
chance
of
rescuing
the
captive
the
savages
once
alarmed
and
warned
could
never
be
approached
again
isolina
would
be
lost
for
ever
my
followers
agreed
with
me
upon
the
imprudence
of
an
attack
folly
they
termed
it
and
not
from
any
motives
of
fear
they
were
willing
to
risk
all
and
had
i
so
ordered
would
have
charged
with
me
rifle
in
hand
into
the
very
midst
of
the
enemy
lines
i
knew
they
would
every
man
of
them
even
the
voyageur
the
least
brave
of
the
party
would
not
have
flinched
for
in
the
midst
of
brave
men
cowards
cease
to
be
but
such
a
course
would
indeed
have
been
folly
madness
we
thought
not
of
adopting
it
all
approved
of
the
plan
i
had
formed
and
which
i
had
already
laid
before
them
as
we
tarried
by
the
noon
several
had
volunteered
to
be
my
companions
to
venture
along
with
me
into
the
camp
of
the
savage
to
share
with
me
the
extreme
of
the
danger
but
for
several
reasons
i
was
determined
to
go
alone
should
even
one
of
them
be
along
with
me
i
saw
it
would
double
the
risk
of
detection
in
this
matter
stratagem
not
strength
was
needed
and
speed
in
the
last
moments
would
be
worth
both
of
course
i
did
not
think
to
get
the
captive
clear
without
being
observed
and
pursued
such
an
expectation
would
have
been
preposterous
she
would
be
too
well
watched
by
the
savages
not
only
by
her
jailers
but
by
the
jealous
eyes
of
those
rival
claimants
of
her
body
no
on
the
contrary
i
anticipated
pursuit
close
and
eager
it
might
be
strife
but
i
trusted
to
my
own
swiftness
of
foot
and
to
hers
for
well
knew
i
her
bold
heart
and
free
limb
it
was
no
helpless
burden
i
should
have
to
bring
away
i
trusted
to
my
being
able
to
baffle
their
pursuit
to
keep
them
back
while
she
ran
forward
for
that
purpose
i
should
take
with
me
my
knife
and
revolvers
i
trusted
to
these
and
much
to
chance
or
perhaps
i
should
rather
say
to
god
my
cause
was
good
my
heart
firm
and
hopeful
other
precautions
i
intended
to
take
horses
ready
as
near
as
they
might
be
brought
men
also
ready
in
their
saddles
rifle
in
hand
ready
for
fight
or
flight
such
was
the
enterprise
upon
which
i
was
resolved
success
or
death
was
staked
upon
the
issue
if
not
successful
i
cared
not
to
survive
it
chapter
eighty
four
painting
injun
withal
i
was
not
reckless
if
not
sanguine
i
was
far
from
despondent
and
as
i
continued
to
dwell
upon
it
the
prospect
seemed
to
brighten
and
success
to
appear
less
problematical
one
of
the
chief
difficulties
i
should
have
to
encounter
would
be
the
camp
once
inside
the
lines
that
is
among
the
and
tents
if
there
should
be
any
i
should
be
comparatively
safe
this
i
knew
from
experience
for
it
would
not
be
my
first
visit
to
an
encampment
of
even
in
their
midst
mingling
with
the
savages
themselves
and
under
the
light
of
their
glaring
fires
i
should
be
less
exposed
to
the
danger
of
detection
than
while
attempting
to
cross
their
lines
first
i
should
have
to
pass
the
outlying
pickets
then
within
these
the
and
within
these
again
the
horses
themselves
you
may
smile
when
i
assert
that
the
last
was
to
me
a
source
of
apprehension
as
great
as
either
of
the
others
an
indian
horse
is
a
sentinel
not
to
be
despised
he
is
as
much
the
enemy
of
the
white
man
as
his
master
and
partly
from
fear
and
partly
from
actual
antipathy
he
will
not
permit
the
former
to
approach
him
the
human
watcher
may
be
negligent
may
sleep
upon
his
post
the
horse
never
the
scent
of
a
white
man
or
the
sight
of
a
skulking
form
will
cause
him
to
snort
and
neigh
so
that
a
whole
camp
will
either
be
or
put
upon
the
alert
in
a
few
minutes
many
a
attack
has
been
defeated
by
the
of
the
sentinel
mustang
it
is
not
that
the
feels
any
peculiar
attachment
for
the
indian
strange
if
he
did
since
tyrant
more
cruel
to
the
equine
race
does
not
exist
no
driver
more
severe
no
rider
more
hard
than
a
it
is
simply
the
faithfulness
which
the
noble
animal
exhibits
for
his
companion
and
master
with
the
instinct
which
tells
him
when
that
master
is
menaced
by
danger
he
will
do
the
same
service
for
a
white
as
for
a
red
man
and
often
does
the
weary
trapper
take
his
lone
rest
with
full
confidence
that
the
vigil
will
be
faithfully
kept
by
his
horse
had
there
been
dogs
in
the
indian
camp
my
apprehensions
would
have
been
still
more
acute
the
danger
would
have
been
more
than
doubled
within
the
lines
these
cunning
brutes
would
have
known
me
as
an
enemy
the
disguise
of
garments
would
not
have
availed
me
by
the
scent
an
indian
dog
can
at
once
tell
the
white
from
the
red
man
and
they
appear
to
hold
a
real
antipathy
against
the
race
of
the
celt
or
saxon
even
in
time
of
truce
a
white
man
entering
an
indian
camp
can
scarcely
be
protected
from
the
wolfish
pack
i
knew
there
were
no
dogs
we
saw
tracks
of
none
the
indians
had
been
upon
the
and
when
they
proceed
on
these
grand
expeditions
their
dogs
like
their
women
are
left
at
home
i
had
reason
to
be
thankful
that
such
was
their
custom
of
course
it
was
my
intention
to
go
disguised
it
would
have
been
madness
to
have
gone
otherwise
in
the
darkest
night
my
uniform
would
have
betrayed
me
but
necessarily
in
my
search
for
the
captive
i
should
be
led
within
the
light
of
the
fires
it
was
my
design
therefore
to
counterfeit
the
indian
costume
and
how
to
do
this
had
been
for
some
time
the
subject
of
my
reflections
i
had
been
congratulating
myself
on
the
possession
of
the
that
would
go
far
towards
the
disguise
but
other
articles
were
wanting
to
complete
my
costume
the
leggings
and
moccasins
the
plumed
and
neck
ornaments
the
long
elfin
locks
the
bronze
complexion
of
arms
and
breast
the
piebald
face
of
chalk
charcoal
and
vermilion
where
were
all
these
to
be
obtained
there
was
no
in
the
desert
in
the
moment
of
excitement
that
succeeded
the
capture
of
the
savage
i
had
been
thinking
of
other
things
it
was
only
when
we
were
about
to
part
from
him
that
the
idea
jumped
into
my
mind
that
bright
idea
that
could
me
the
very
man
i
turned
back
to
reconnoitre
his
person
dismounting
i
scanned
him
from
head
to
foot
with
delight
my
eyes
rested
upon
his
his
moccasins
his
pendent
collar
of
his
stained
red
and
the
ample
robe
of
that
draped
his
back
all
pleased
me
much
but
that
we
were
bent
on
an
errand
of
peril
the
article
would
not
have
been
left
there
my
followers
had
eyed
it
with
avidity
and
more
than
one
of
them
had
been
desirous
of
removing
it
but
the
prospect
of
proximate
peril
had
damped
the
ardour
for
spoil
and
the
splendid
robe
had
been
permitted
to
remain
where
so
gracefully
it
hung
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
savage
it
soon
replaced
the
buffalo
robe
upon
mine
my
boots
were
cast
aside
and
my
legs
encased
in
the
leggings
my
hips
were
swathed
in
the
leathern
and
my
feet
thrust
into
the
of
the
comanche
which
by
good
fortune
fitted
to
a
hair
there
was
yet
much
required
to
make
me
an
indian
comanches
upon
the
go
naked
from
the
waist
upward
the
is
only
worn
by
them
when
hunting
or
on
ordinary
occasions
how
was
i
to
counterfeit
the
copper
skin
the
bronzed
arms
and
shoulders
the
mottled
breast
the
face
of
red
and
white
and
black
paint
only
could
aid
me
and
where
was
paint
to
be
procured
the
black
we
could
imitate
with
gunpowder
but
wagh
ejaculated
rube
who
was
seen
holding
in
his
hands
a
prettily
trimmed
and
garnished
with
quills
and
beads
the
of
the
indian
wagh
i
thort
we
find
the
mateeruls
in
the
hyur
they
be
rube
had
dived
his
hand
to
the
bottom
of
the
embroidered
bag
and
while
speaking
drew
it
triumphantly
forth
several
little
leathern
packets
appeared
between
his
fingers
which
from
their
stained
outsides
evidently
contained
pigments
of
various
colours
whilst
a
small
shining
object
in
their
midst
proved
on
closer
inspection
to
be
a
neither
the
trappers
nor
myself
were
astonished
at
finding
these
odd
notions
in
such
a
place
on
the
contrary
it
was
natural
we
should
have
looked
for
them
there
seldom
in
peace
but
never
in
time
of
war
does
the
indian
ride
abroad
without
his
rouge
and
his
mirror
the
colours
were
of
the
right
sort
and
corresponded
exactly
with
those
that
glittered
upon
the
skin
of
the
captive
warrior
under
the
keen
edge
of
a
bowie
my
moustaches
came
off
in
a
twinkling
a
little
grease
was
procured
the
paints
were
mixed
and
placing
myself
side
by
side
with
the
indian
i
stood
for
portrait
rube
was
the
painter
a
piece
of
soft
buckskin
his
brush
the
broad
palm
of
garey
his
palette
the
operation
did
not
last
a
great
while
in
twenty
minutes
it
was
all
over
and
the
indian
brave
and
i
appeared
the
exact
counterparts
of
each
other
streak
by
streak
and
spot
by
spot
had
the
old
trapper
imitated
those
hideous
hieroglyphics
even
to
the
red
hand
upon
the
breast
and
the
cross
upon
the
brow
in
horrid
aspect
the
copy
quite
equalled
the
original
one
thing
was
still
lacking
an
important
element
in
the
metamorphosis
of
disguise
i
wanted
the
long
snaky
black
tresses
that
adorned
the
head
of
the
comanche
the
want
was
soon
supplied
again
the
bowie
blade
was
called
upon
to
serve
as
scissors
and
with
garey
to
perform
the
tonsorial
feat
the
of
the
indian
was
shorn
of
its
flowing
glories
the
savage
winced
as
the
keen
blade
glistened
around
his
brow
he
had
no
other
thought
than
that
he
was
about
to
be
scalped
alive
the
way
i
raise
his
har
the
dodrotted
skunk
muttered

as
he
stood
watching
the
operation

garey
did
not
give
heed
to
this
cruel
counsel
which
he
knew
was
not
meant
for
earnest
a
rude
scratch
was
soon
constructed
and
being
placed
upon
my
head
was
attached
to
my
own
waving
locks
fortunately
these
were
of
dark
colour
and
the
hue
corresponded
i
fancied
i
saw
the
indian
smile
when
he
perceived
the
use
we
were
making
of
his
splendid
tresses
it
was
a
grim
smile
however
and
from
the
first
moment
to
the
last
neither
word
nor
ejaculation
escaped
from
his
lips
even
i
was
forced
to
smile
i
could
not
restrain
myself
the
odd
travestie
in
which
we
were
engaged
the
strange
commingling
of
the
comic
and
serious
in
the
act
and
above
all
the
ludicrous
look
of
the
captive
indian
after
they
had
close
cropped
him
was
enough
to
make
a
stone
smile
my
comrades
could
not
contain
themselves
but
laughed
outright
the

now
placed
on
my
head
it
was
fortunate
the
brave
had
one

this
magnificent

rarely
worn
on
a
fortunate
for
it
aided
materially
in
completing
the
counterfeit
with
it
upon
my
head
the
false
hair
could
hardly
have
been
detected
under
the
light
of
day
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
the
painter
hairdresser
and
costumier
had
performed
their
several
offices
i
was
ready
for
the
masquerade
chapter
eighty
five
the
last
hours
on
the
trail
more
cautiously
than
ever
we
now
crept
along
the
trail
advancing
only
after
the
ground
had
been
thoroughly
quartered
by
the
scouts
time
was
of
the
least
consequence
the
fresh
sign
of
the
indians
told
us
they
were
but
a
short
way
ahead
of
us
we
believed
we
could
have
ridden
within
sight
of
them
at
any
moment
we
did
not
wish
to
set
eyes
on
them
before
sunset
it
could
be
no
advantage
to
us
to
overtake
them
on
the
march
but
the
contrary
some
lagging
indian
might
be
found
in
the
rear
of
the
band
we
might
come
in
contact
with
him
and
thus
defeat
all
our
designs
we
hung
back
therefore
allowing
sufficient
time
for
the
savages
to
pitch
their
camp
and
for
their
stragglers
to
get
into
it
on
the
other
hand
i
did
not
desire
to
arrive
late
the
council
was
to
be
held
that
night
so
she
had
learned
and
after
the
council
would
come
the
i
must
be
in
time
for
both
at
what
hour
would
the
council
take
place
it
might
be
just
after
they
had
halted
the
son
of
a
chief
and
a
chief
himself
for
the
white
renegade
was
a
leader
of
red
men
a
question
between
two
such
men
would
not
remain
long
undecided
and
a
question
of
so
much
importance
involving
such
consequence
property
in
body
and
soul
possession
of
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
oh
i
wondered
could
these
hideous
brutes
appreciate
that
peerless
beauty
impossible
i
thought
the
delicate
lines
of
her
loveliness
would
be
lost
upon
their
gross
eyes
and
coarse
sensual
hearts
that
pearl
beyond
price
paste
would
have
satisfied
them
as
well
they
could
not
distinguish
the
diamond
from
common
glass
and
yet
the
comanche
is
not
without
coarse
as
might
be
the
passion
no
doubt
they
loved
her
both
loved
her
red
savage
and
white
savage
for
this
very
reason
the
trial
would
not
be
delayed
the
question
would
be
speedily
decided
in
order
that
the
quarrel
of
the
chiefs
might
be
brought
to
an
end
for
this
very
reason
the
crisis
might
be
hastened
the
council
take
place
at
an
early
hour
for
this
very
reason
i
too
must
needs
be
early
upon
the
spot
it
was
my
aim
to
arrive
within
sight
of
the
indian
encampment
just
before
night
in
the
twilight
if
possible
that
we
might
be
able
to
make
reconnoissance
of
the
ground
before
darkness
should
cover
it
from
our
view
we
were
desirous
of
acquainting
ourselves
with
the
lay
of
the
surrounding
country
as
well
so
that
in
the
event
of
our
escape
we
should
know
which
was
the
best
direction
to
take
we
timed
our
advance
by
the
sign
upon
the
trail
the
keen
scouts
could
tell
almost
to
a
minute
when
the
latest
tracks
were
made
and
by
this
we
were
guided
both
glided
silently
along
their
eyes
constantly
and
earnestly
turned
upon
the
ground
mine
were
more
anxiously
bent
upon
the
sky
from
that
quarter
i
most
feared
an
obstacle
to
the
execution
of
my
purpose
what
a
change
had
come
over
my
desires
how
different
were
they
from
those
of
the
two
preceding
nights
the
very
same
aspect
of
the
heavens
that
had
hitherto
chagrined
and
baffled
me
would
now
have
been
welcome
in
my
heart
i
had
lately
execrated
the
clouds
in
that
same
heart
i
was
now
praying
for
cloud
and
storm
and
darkness
now
could
i
have
blessed
the
clouds
but
there
were
none
to
bless
not
a
speck
appeared
over
the
whole
face
of
the
firmament
the
eye
beheld
only
the
illimitable
ether
in
another
hour
that
boundless
blue
would
be
studded
with
millions
of
bright
stars
and
silvered
by
the
light
of
a
resplendent
moon
the
night
would
be
as
day
i
was
dismayed
at
the
prospect
i
prayed
for
cloud
and
storm
and
darkness
human
heart
when
blinded
by
its
own
petty
passions
unreasoning
and
unreasonable
my
petition
was
opposed
to
the
unalterable
laws
of
nature
it
could
not
be
heard
i
can
scarcely
describe
how
the
aspect
of
that
bright
sky
troubled
and
pained
me
the
which
joys
only
in
deepest
darkness
could
not
have
liked
it
less
should
there
be
moonlight
the
enterprise
would
be
made
more
perilous
doubly
more
should
there
be
moonlight
why
need
i
form
an
hypothesis
moonlight
there
be
to
a
certainty
it
was
the
middle
of
the
lunar
month
and
the
moon
would
be
up
almost
as
the
sun
went
down
full
round
and
almost
as
bright
as
he
with
no
cloud
to
cover
her
face
to
shroud
the
earth
from
her
white
light
certainly
there
would
be
moonlight
well
thought
of
was
that
disguise
well
spent
our
labour
in
making
it
so
perfect
under
the
moonlight
to
it
only
could
i
trust
by
it
only
might
i
expect
to
preserve
my
incognito
but
the
eye
of
the
indian
savage
is
sharp
and
his
perception
keen
almost
as
instinct
itself
i
could
not
rely
much
upon
my
borrowed
plumes
should
speech
be
required
from
me
just
on
account
of
the
cunning
imitation
the
perfectness
of
the
pattern
some
friends
of
the
original
might
have
business
with
me
might
approach
and
address
me
i
knew
but
a
few
words
of
comanche
how
should
i
escape
from
the
colloquy
such
thoughts
were
troubling
me
as
we
rode
onward
night
was
near
the
sun
lower
limb
rested
on
the
far
horizon
of
the
west
the
hour
was
an
anxious
one
to
me
the
scouts
had
been
for
some
time
in
the
advance
without
returning
to
report
and
we
had
halted
in
a
copse
to
wait
for
them
a
high
hill
was
before
us
wooded
only
at
the
summit
over
this
hill
the
led
we
had
observed
the
scouts
go
into
the
timber
we
kept
our
eyes
upon
the
spot
waiting
for
their
return
presently
one
of
them
appeared
just
outside
the
edge
of
the
wood
garey
we
saw
it
was
he
made
signs
to
us
to
come
on
we
rode
up
the
hill
and
entered
among
the
trees
after
going
a
little
farther
we
diverged
from
the
trail
the
scout
guided
us
through
the
trunks
over
the
high
summit
on
the
other
side
the
wood
extended
only
a
little
below
but
we
did
not
ride
beyond
it
we
halted
before
coming
to
its
edge
and
dismounting
tied
our
horses
to
the
trees
we
crept
forward
on
our
hands
and
knees
till
we
had
reached
the
utmost
verge
of
the
timber
through
the
leaves
we
peered
looking
down
into
the
plain
beyond
we
saw
smokes
and
fires
and
a
in
their
midst
we
saw
dark
forms
around
men
moving
over
the
ground
and
horses
with
their
heads
to
the
grass
we
were
looking
upon
the
camp
of
the
comanches
chapter
eighty
six
the
comanche
camp
we
had
reached
our
ground
just
at
the
moment
i
desired
it
was
twilight
dark
enough
to
render
ourselves
inconspicuous
under
the
additional
shadow
of
the
trees
yet
sufficiently
clear
to
allow
a
full
reconnoissance
of
the
enemy
position
our
point
of
view
was
a
good
one
under
a
single
commanding
the
encampment
and
a
vast
extent
of
country
around
it
the
hill
we
had
climbed
a
sort
of
isolated
was
the
only
eminence
of
any
considerable
elevation
for
miles
around
and
the
site
of
the
camp
was
upon
the
plain
that
stretched
away
from
its
base
apparently
beyond
limit
the
plain
was
what
is
termed
a
pecan
prairie
that
is
a
prairie
half
covered
with
groves
copses
and
lists
of
woodland
in
which
the
predominating
tree
is
the
pecan
a
species
of
hickory
bearing
an
oval
edible
nut
of
commercial
value
between
the
groves
and
of
timber
single
trees
stood
apart
their
heads
fully
developed
by
the
free
play
given
to
their
branches
these
trees
with
the
groves
of
the
pecan
lent
an
air
of
high
civilisation
to
the
landscape
and
a
winding
stream
whose
water
under
the
still
lingering
rays
glistened
with
the
sheen
of
silver
added
to
the
deception
withal
it
was
a
wilderness
a
beautiful
wilderness
human
hands
had
never
planted
those
groves
human
agency
had
nought
to
do
with
the
formation
or
adornment
of
that
lovely
landscape
upon
the
bank
of
the
stream
and
about
half
a
mile
from
the
base
of
the
hill
stood
the
indian
camp
a
glance
at
the
position
showed
how
well
it
had
been
chosen
not
so
much
for
defence
as
to
protect
it
against
a
surprise
assuming
the
lodge
there
was
but
one
as
the
centre
of
the
camp
it
was
placed
upon
the
edge
of
a
small
grove
and
fronting
the
stream
from
the
tent
to
the
water
edge
the
plain
sloped
gently
downward
like
the
glacis
of
a
fortification
the
smooth
sward
that
covered
the
space
between
the
trees
and
the
water
was
the
ground
of
the
camp
on
this
could
be
seen
the
dusky
warriors
some
afoot
standing
in
listless
attitudes
or
moving
about
others
reclining
upon
the
grass
and
still
others
bending
over
the
fires
as
if
engaged
in
the
preparation
of
their
evening
meal
a
line
of
spears
regularly
placed
marked
the
allotment
of
each
the
slender
shafts
nearly
five
yards
in
length
rose
tall
above
the
turf
like
masts
of
distant
ships
displaying
their
profusion
of
pennons
and
bannerets
of
painted
plumes
and
human
hair
at
the
base
of
each
could
be
seen
the
gaudy
shield
the
bow
and
quiver
the
embroidered
pouch
and
of
the
owner
and
grouped
around
many
of
them
appeared
objects
of
a
far
different
character
objects
that
we
could
not
contemplate
without
acute
emotion
they
were
women
enough
of
light
still
ruled
the
sky
to
show
us
their
faces
they
were
white
women
the
captives
strange
were
my
sensations
as
i
regarded
those
forms
and
faces
but
they
were
far
off
even
a
lover
eye
was
unequal
to
the
distance
flanking
the
camp
on
right
and
left
were
the
horses
they
occupied
a
broad
belt
of
ground
for
they
were
staked
out
to
feed
and
each
was
allowed
the
length
of
his
lazo
their
line
converged
to
the
rear
and
met
behind
the
grove
so
that
the
camp
was
embraced
by
an
arc
of
browsing
animals
the
river
forming
its
chord
across
the
stream
the
encampment
did
not
extend
i
have
said
that
the
spot
was
well
selected
to
guard
against
a
surprise
its
peculiar
adaptability
consisted
in
the
fact
that
the
little
grove
that
backed
the
camp
was
the
only
timber
within
a
radius
of
a
thousand
yards
all
around
and
even
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
the
plain
was
treeless
and
free
from
cover
of
any
kind
there
were
no
inequalities
of
ground
neither
brake
bush
nor
scaur
to
shelter
the
approach
of
an
enemy
had
this
position
been
chosen
or
was
it
accidental
in
such
a
place
and
at
such
a
time
it
was
not
likely
they
had
any
fear
of
a
surprise
but
with
the
indian
caution
is
so
habitually
exercised
that
it
becomes
almost
an
instinct
and
doubtless
under
such
a
habit
and
without
any
forethought
whatever
the
savages
had
fixed
upon
the
spot
where
they
were
encamped
the
grove
gave
them
wood
the
stream
water
the
plain
pabulum
for
their
horses
with
one
of
these
last
for
their
own
food
they
had
all
the
requisites
of
an
indian
camp
at
the
first
glance
i
saw
the
strength
of
their
position
not
so
much
with
the
eye
of
a
soldier
as
with
that
of
a
hunter
and
did
i
perceive
it
in
a
military
sense
it
offered
no
point
of
defence
but
it
could
not
be
approached
by
stratagem
and
that
is
all
the
ever
fears
alarm
him
not
too
suddenly
give
him
five
minutes
warning
and
he
can
not
be
attacked
if
superior
in
strength
you
may
chase
him
but
you
must
be
better
mounted
than
he
to
bring
him
to
close
combat
retreat
not
defence
is
generally
the
leading
idea
of
comanche
strategy
unless
when
opposed
to
a
mexican
foe
then
he
will
stand
fight
with
the
courage
of
a
master
as
i
continued
to
gaze
at
the
indian
encampment
my
heart
sank
within
me
except
under
cover
of
a
dark
night
a
very
dark
night
it
could
not
be
entered
the
keenest
spy
could
not
have
approached
it
it
appeared
unapproachable
the
same
thought
must
at
that
moment
have
occupied
the
minds
of
my
companions
i
saw
the
gloom
of
disappointment
on
the
brows
of
all
as
they
knelt
beside
me
silent
and
sullen
none
of
them
said
a
word
they
had
not
spoken
since
we
came
upon
the
ground
chapter
eighty
seven
no
cover
in
silence
i
continued
to
scrutinise
the
camp
but
could
discover
no
mode
of
approaching
it
secretly
or
in
safety
as
i
have
said
the
adjacent
plain
for
nearly
a
thousand
yards
radius
was
a
smooth
prairie
even
the
grass
was
short
it
would
scarcely
have
sheltered
the
smallest
game
much
less
afford
cover
for
the
body
of
a
man
much
less
for
that
of
a
horse
i
should
willingly
have
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
over
the
that
separated
us
from
the
encampment
but
that
would
have
been
of
no
service
i
might
just
as
well
have
walked
erect
erect
or
prostrate
i
should
be
seen
all
the
same
by
the
occupants
of
the
camp
or
the
guards
of
the
horses
even
if
i
succeeded
in
effecting
an
entrance
within
the
lines
what
then
even
should
i
succeed
in
finding
isolina
what
then
what
hope
was
there
of
our
getting
off
there
was
no
probability
of
our
being
able
to
pass
the
lines
unseen
not
the
least
we
should
certainly
be
pursued
and
what
chance
for
us
to
escape
it
was
not
probable
we
could
run
for
a
thousand
yards
with
the
hue
and
cry
after
us
no
we
should
be
overtaken
recaptured
speared
or
tomahawked
upon
the
spot
the
design
i
had
formed
was
to
bring
my
horse
as
close
as
possible
to
the
camp
to
leave
him
under
cover
and
within
such
a
distance
as
would
make
it
possible
to
reach
him
by
a
run
then
mounting
with
my
betrothed
in
my
arms
to
gallop
on
to
my
comrades
the
men
i
had
intended
should
be
placed
in
ambush
as
near
to
the
camp
as
the
nature
of
the
ground
would
permit
but
my
preconceived
plan
was
entirely
frustrated
by
the
peculiar
situation
of
the
indian
encampment
i
had
anticipated
that
there
would
be
either
trees
brushwood
or
broken
ground
in
its
neighbourhood
under
shelter
of
which
we
might
approach
it
to
my
chagrin
i
now
saw
that
there
was
none
of
the
three
there
was
no
timber
nearer
than
the
grove
in
which
we
were
lying
the
copse
excepted
and
to
have
reached
this
would
have
been
to
enter
the
camp
itself
we
appeared
to
have
advanced
to
the
utmost
limit
possible
that
afforded
cover
a
few
feet
farther
would
have
carried
us
outside
the
margin
of
the
wood
and
then
we
should
have
been
as
conspicuous
to
the
denizens
of
the
camp
as
they
now
were
to
us
forward
we
dared
not
stir
not
a
step
farther
i
was
puzzled
and
perplexed
once
more
i
turned
my
eyes
upon
the
sky
but
i
drew
not
thence
a
ray
of
hope
the
heavens
were
too
bright
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
the
west
but
in
the
east
was
rising
full
round
and
red
almost
his
counterpart
how
i
should
have
welcomed
an
eclipse
i
thought
of
omnipotent
power
i
thought
of
the
command
of
the
israelitish
captain
i
should
have
joyed
to
see
the
shadow
of
the
opaque
earth
pass
over
that
shining
orb
and
rob
it
of
its
borrowed
light
if
only
for
a
single
hour
eclipse
or
cloud
there
was
none
no
prospect
of
one
or
other
no
hope
either
from
the
earth
or
the
sky
verily
then
must
i
abandon
my
design
and
adopt
some
other
for
the
rescue
of
my
betrothed
what
other
i
could
think
of
none
there
was
no
other
that
might
be
termed
a
plan
we
might
gallop
forward
and
openly
attack
the
camp
sheer
desperation
alone
could
impel
us
to
such
a
course
and
the
result
would
be
ruin
to
all
to
her
among
the
rest
we
could
not
hope
to
rescue
nine
to
a
hundred
for
we
saw
and
could
now
count
our
dusky
foemen
they
would
see
us
afar
off
would
be
prepared
to
receive
us
prepared
to
hurl
their
masses
upon
us
to
destroy
us
altogether
sheer
desperation
what
other
plan
what
something
of
one
occurred
to
me
at
that
moment
a
slight
shadow
of
it
had
crossed
my
mind
before
it
seemed
practicable
though
fearfully
perilous
but
what
of
peril
it
was
not
the
time
nor
was
i
in
the
mood
to
regard
danger
anything
short
of
the
prospect
of
certain
death
had
no
terror
for
me
then
and
even
this
i
should
have
preferred
to
failure
we
had
along
with
us
the
horse
of
the
captive
comanche
stanfield
had
brought
the
animal
having
left
his
own
in
exchange
i
thought
of
mounting
the
indian
horse
and
riding
him
into
the
camp
in
this
consisted
the
whole
of
the
scheme
that
now
presented
itself
surely
the
idea
was
a
good
one
a
slight
alteration
of
my
original
plan
i
had
already
undertaken
to
play
the
of
an
indian
warrior
while
within
the
camp
it
would
only
require
me
to
begin
the
personation
outside
the
lines
and
make
my
along
with
my
there
would
be
more
dramatic
appropriateness
with
a
proportionate
increase
of
danger
but
i
did
not
jest
thus
i
had
no
thought
of
merriment
at
the
time
the
travesty
i
had
undertaken
was
no
burlesque
the
worst
feature
of
this
new
scheme
was
the
increased
risk
of
being
brought
in
contact
with
the
friends
of
the
warrior
of
the
red
hand
of
being
accosted
by
them
and
of
course
expected
to
make
reply
how
could
i
avoid
meeting
them
one
or
more
of
them
if
interrogated
how
shun
making
answer
i
knew
a
few
words
of
the
comanche
tongue
but
not
enough
to
hold
a
conversation
in
it
either
my
false
accent
or
my
voice
would
betray
me
true
i
might
answer
in
spanish
many
of
the
comanches
speak
this
language
but
my
using
it
would
appear
a
suspicious
circumstance
there
was
another
source
of
apprehension
i
could
not
confide
in
the
indian
horse
he
had
endeavoured
to
fling
stanfield
all
along
the
way
kicking
violently
and
biting
at
his
saxon
rider
while
seated
upon
his
back
should
he
behave
in
a
similar
manner
with
me
while
entering
the
camp
it
would
certainly
attract
the
attention
of
the
indian
guards
it
would
lead
to
scrutiny
and
suspicion
still
another
fear
even
should
i
succeed
in
the
main
points
in
entering
the
camp
finding
the
captive
and
wresting
her
from
the
hands
of
her
jailers
how
after
i
could
never
depend
upon
this
capricious
mustang
to
carry
us
clear
of
the
pursuit
there
would
be
others
as
swift
perhaps
swifter
than
he
and
we
should
only
be
carried
back
to
die
oh
that
i
could
have
taken
my
own
steed
near
to
the
line
of
yonder
guard
oh
that
i
could
have
hidden
him
there
it
might
not
be
i
saw
that
it
could
not
be
and
i
was
forced
to
abandon
the
thoughts
of
it
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
risk
all
the
chances
of
my
assumed
character
by
mounting
the
indian
horse
to
my
comrades
i
imparted
the
idea
and
asked
their
counsel
all
regarded
it
as
fraught
with
danger
one
or
two
advised
me
against
it
they
were
those
who
did
not
understand
my
motives
who
could
not
comprehend
the
sentiment
of
love
who
knew
not
the
strength
and
courage
which
that
noble
passion
may
impart
little
understood
they
how
its
emotions
inspire
to
deeds
of
daring
how
love
absorbs
all
selfishness
even
life
becoming
a
secondary
consideration
when
weighed
against
the
happiness
or
safety
of
its
object
these
rude
men
had
never
loved
as
i
gave
no
ear
to
their
too
prudent
counsels
others
acknowledged
the
danger
but
saw
not
how
i
could
act
differently
one
or
two
had
in
their
life
course
experienced
a
touch
of
tender
feeling
akin
to
mine
these
could
appreciate
and
counselled
me
in
consonance
with
my
resolution
i
liked
their
counsel
best
one
had
not
yet
spoken
one
upon
whose
advice
i
placed
a
higher
value
than
upon
the
combined
wisdom
of
all
the
others
i
had
not
yet
taken
the
opinion
of
the
earless
trapper
chapter
eighty
eight
rube
consulting
his
oracle
he
was
standing
apart
from
the
rest
leaning
i
should
rather
say
for
his
body
was
not
erect
but
diagonal
in
this
attitude
it
was
propped
by
his
rifle
the
butt
of
which
was
steadied
against
the
stump
of
a
tree
whilst
the
muzzle
appeared
to
rest
upon
the
bridge
of
rube
own
nose
as
the
man
and
the
piece
were
about
of
a
length
the
two
just
placed
in
juxtaposition
presented
the
exact
figure
of
an
inverted
v
and
the
small
skull
of
the
trapper
formed
a
sufficiently
tapering
apex
to
the
angle
both
his
hands
were
clasped
round
the
barrel
near
its
muzzle
his
fingers
interlocking
while
the
thumbs
lay
flat
one
upon
each
side
of
his
nose
at
first
glance
it
was
difficult
to
tell
whether
he
was
gazing
into
the
barrel
of
the
piece
or
beyond
it
upon
the
indian
camp
the
attitude
was
not
new
to
him
nor
to
me
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
observed
him
in
a
posture
precisely
similar
i
knew
it
was
his
favourite
when
any
question
of
unusual
difficulty
required
all
the
energy
of
his
instincts
he
was
now
as
often
of
yore
consulting
his
divinity
presumed
to
dwell
far
down
within
the
dark
tube
of
targuts
after
a
time
all
the
others
ceased
to
speak
and
stood
watching
him
they
knew
that
no
step
would
be
taken
before
rube
advice
had
been
received
and
they
waited
with
more
or
less
patience
for
him
to
speak
full
ten
minutes
passed
and
still
the
old
trapper
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
nor
lip
nor
muscle
of
him
was
seen
to
move
the
eyes
alone
could
be
detected
in
motion
and
these
small
orbs
scintillating
in
their
deep
sockets
were
the
only
signs
of
life
which
he
showed
standing
rigid
and
still
he
appeared
not
a
statue
but
a
scarecrow
propped
up
by
a
stick
and
the
long
brown
rifle
did
not
belie
the
resemblance
full
ten
minutes
passed
and
still
he
spoke
not
his
oracle
had
not
yet
yielded
its
response
i
have
said
that
at
the
first
glance
it
was
difficult
to
tell
whether
the
old
man
was
gazing
into
the
barrel
of
his
gun
or
beyond
it
after
watching
him
closely
i
observed
that
he
was
doing
both
now
his
eyes
were
a
little
raised
as
if
he
looked
upon
the
plain
anon
they
were
lowered
and
apparently
peering
into
the
tube
he
was
drawing
the
data
of
his
problem
from
facts
he
was
trusting
to
his
divinity
for
the
solution
for
a
long
time
he
kept
up
this
singular
process
of
conjuration
alternating
his
glances
in
equal
distribution
between
the
hollow
cylinder
and
the
circle
of
vision
that
comprehended
within
its
circumference
the
comanche
encampment
the
others
began
to
grow
impatient
all
were
interested
in
the
result
and
not
without
reason
standing
upon
the
limits
of
a
it
is
not
strange
they
should
feel
anxiety
about
the
issue
thus
far
however
none
had
offered
to
interrupt
or
question
the
queer
old
man
none
dared
one
or
two
of
the
party
had
already
had
a
taste
of
his
quality
when
fretted
or
interfered
with
and
no
one
desired
to
draw
upon
himself
the
sharp
talk
of
the
earless
trapper
garey
at
length
approached
but
not
until
rube
with
a
triumphant
toss
of
his
head
and
a
scarcely
audible
wheep
from
his
thin
lips
showed
signs
that
the
consultation
had
ended
and
that
the
joss
who
dwelt
at
the
bottom
of
his
had
vouchsafed
an
answer
i
had
watched
him
with
the
rest
i
liked
that
expressive
hitch
of
the
head
i
liked
the
low
but
momentous
sibillation
that
terminated
the
between
him
and
his
familiar
spirit
they
were
signs
that
the
knot
was
unravelled
that
the
old
trapper
had
devised
some
feasible
plan
by
which
the
indian
camp
might
be
entered
garey
and
i
drew
near
but
not
to
question
him
we
understood
him
too
well
for
that
we
knew
that
he
must
be
left
free
to
develop
his
purpose
in
his
own
time
and
we
left
him
free
simply
placing
ourselves

he
moved
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
timber
making
a
sign
for
garey
and
myself
to
follow
on
reaching
its
outer
edge
but
still
within
cover
he
dropped
down
upon
his
knees
behind
some
evergreen
bushes
i
imitated
his
example
and
knelt
upon
his
right
while
garey
crouched
down
on
the
left
our
eyes
were
directed
upon
the
indian
camp
of
which
and
the
plain
around
it
we
had
a
good
view
as
good
as
could
be
obtained
under
the
light
of
a
brilliant
moon
alas
too
brilliant
after
we
had
surveyed
the
scene
for
some
moments
in
silence
the
old
trapper
condescended
to
begin
the
conversation

interrogatively
unner

ivery

the

o

garey
and
i
once
more
scrutinised
the
whole
circumference
of
the
encampment
and
the
ground
adjacent
we
could
perceive
no
cover
by
which
the
camp
could
be
approached
surely
there
was
none
what
could
rube
mean
were
there
clouds
in
the
sky
had
he
perceived
some
portent
of
coming
darkness
and
had
his
words
reference
to
this
i
raised
my
eyes
and
swept
the
whole
canopy
with
inquiring
glances
up
to
the
zenith
around
the
horizon
east

north
and
south
i
looked
for
clouds
but
looked
in

a
few
light
cirrhi
floated
high
in
the
atmosphere
but
these
even
when
crossing
the
moon
disk
cast
no
perceptible
shadow
on
the
contrary
they
were
tokens
of
settled
weather
and
moving
slowly
almost
fixed
upon
the
face
of
the
heavens
were
evidence
that
no
sudden
change
might
be
expected
when
the
trapper
talked
of
entering
the
camp
under
cover
he
could
not
have
meant
under

of
darkness

o

as
blind
as

kittlins
o

neither
of
us
made
reply
to
the
final
interrogatory
for
the
first
time
we
began
to
comprehend
rube
meaning
and
our
eyes
as
well
as
thoughts
were
suddenly
directed
upon
the
object
indicated
by
his
words
the
bank
of
the
stream
for
to
that
he
referred
i
have
stated
that
the
little
river
ran
close
to
the
indian
lines
and
on
one
side
formed
the
boundary
of
the
camp
we
could
tell
that
the
current
was
towards
us
for
the
stream
on
reaching
the
hill
upon
which
we
were
turned
sharply
off
and
swept
round
its
base
the
indian
camp
was
on
the
left
bank
though
upon
its
right
when
viewed
as
we
were
regarding
it
any
one
proceeding
up
the
left
bank
must
therefore
necessarily
pass
within
the
lines
and
through
among
the
horses
that
were
staked
nearest
to
the
water
it
need
not
be
supposed
that
under
our
keen
scrutiny
the
stream
had
hitherto
escaped
observation
i
myself
had
long
ago
thought
of
it
as
a
means
of
covering
my
approach
and
time
after
time
had
my
eyes
dwelt
upon
it
but
without
result
in
its
channel
i
could
perceive
no
shelter
from
observation
its
banks
were
low
and
without
either
rush
or
bush
upon
them
the
green
turf
of
the
prairie
stretched
up
to
the
very
brink
and
scarcely
twelve
inches
below
its
level
was
the
surface
of
the
current
water
this
was
especially
the
case
along
the
front
of
the
encampment
and
for
some
distance
above
and
below
any
one
endeavouring
to
enter
the
camp
by
stealing
up
the
channel
must
have
gone
completely
under
the
water
for
a
swimmer
could
have
been
observed
upon
its
surface
even
if
a
man
could
have
approached
in
this
way
there
was
no
hope
that
a
horse
could
be
taken
with
him
and
without
the
horse
what
prospect
of
ultimate
escape
it
had
seemed
to
me
impossible
more
than
once

i
taken
into
consideration

thet

appeared

enough
the
sinking
of
the
water
was
a
new
element
it
had
escaped
my
observation
though
rube
had
noted
it
it
was
this
that
had
delayed
him
so
long
in
giving
his
opinion
he
had
been
watching
it
while
leaning
upon
his
rifle
though
none
of
the
rest
of
us
had
thought
of
such
a
thing
he
remembered
the
heavy
rain
of
the
night
before
he
saw
that
it
had
caused
a
freshet
in
the
little
river
that
its
subsidence
had
begun
and
as
in
most
was
progressing
with
rapidity
his
keen
eye
had
detected
a
fall
of
several
inches
during
the
we
had
been
upon
the
ground
i
could
myself
observe
now
the
thing
was
pointed
out
to
me
that
the
banks
were
than
before
certainly
the
idea
of
approaching
by
the
stream
had
assumed
a
more
feasible
aspect
if
the
channel
should
prove
deep
enough
i
might
get
the
horse
sufficiently
near
the

have

be

desized

safest
ur
i
was
not
long
in
making
up
my
mind
rube
counsel
decided
me
and
i
resolved
to
act
accordingly
chapter
ninety
taking
to
the
water
i
spent
but
little
time
in
preparations
these
had
been
made
already
it
remained
only
to
tighten
my
look
to
the
caps
of
my
revolvers
and
place
both
pistols
and
knife
in
the
belt
behind
my
back
where
the
weapons
would
be
concealed
by
the
pendent
robe
of
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
ready
i
still
loitered
a
while
to
wait
for
the
falling
of
the
water
not
long
my
anxiety
did
not
permit
me
to
tarry
long
the
hour
of
the
council
might
be
nigh
i
might
be
too
late
for
the
crisis
not
long
did
i
loiter
it
was
not
necessary
even
by
the
moonlight
we
could
distinguish
the
dark
line
of
the
bank
separating
the
grassy
turf
from
the
surface
of
the
water
the
rippling
current
was
shining
like
and
by
contrast
the
brown
earthy
strip
that
rose
vertically
above
it
could
be
observed
more
distinctly
it
was
sensibly
broader
i
could
wait
no
longer
i
leaped
into
the
saddle
my
comrades
crowded
around
me
to
say
a
parting
word
and
with
a
wish
or
a
prayer
upon
their
lips
one
after
another
pressed
my
hand
some
doubted
of
their
ever
seeing
me
again
i
could
tell
this
from
the
tone
of
their
others
were
more
confident
all
vowed
to
revenge
me
if
i
fell
rube
and
garey
went
with
me
down
the
hill
at
the
point
where
the
stream
impinged
upon
the
hill
there
were
bushes
these
continued
up
the
declivity
and
joined
the
timber
upon
the
summit
under
their
cover
we
descended
reaching
the
bank
just
at
the
salient
angle
of
the
bend
a
thin
skirting
of
similar
bushes
ran
around
the
base
of
the
hill
and
we
now
perceived
that
by
following
the
path
on
which
we
had
come
the
ambuscade
might
have
been
brought
a
little
nearer
to
the
camp
but
the
cover
was
not
so
good
as
the
grove
upon
the
summit
and
in
case
of
a
retreat
it
would
be
necessary
to
gallop
up
the
naked
face
of
the
slope
and
thus
expose
our
numbers
it
was
decided
therefore
after
a
short
consultation
to
leave
the
men
where
they
were
from
the
bend
where
we
stood
to
the
indian
camp
the
river
trended
almost
in
a
straight
line
and
its
long
reach
lay
before
our
eyes
like
a
band
of
shining
metal
along
its
banks
the
bush
extended
no
farther
a
single
step
towards
the
camp
would
have
exposed
us
to
the
view
of
its
occupants
at
this
point
therefore
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
take
to
the
water
and
dismounting
i
made
ready
for
the
immersion
the
trappers
had
spoken
their
last
words
of
instruction
and
counsel
they
had
both
grasped
my
hand
giving
it
a
significant
squeeze
that
promised
more
than
words
but
to
these
too
had
they
given
utterance
do
be
afeerd
said
the
younger
rube
and
i
wo
be
far
off
if
we
hear
your
pistols
we
make
a
rush
you
and
meet
you
anyhow
and
if
onything
should
happen
amiss
here
garey

with
emphasis

depend

us
put
straight
for
the
timmer
an
gallip
as
ef
ole
scratch
wur
at
the
tail
o
yur
critter
i
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
leading
moro
down
the
bank
at
a
place
where
it
sloped
i
stepped
gently
into
the
current
my
steed
followed
without
hesitation
and
in
another
instant
we
were
both
in
the
flood
the
water
was
just
the
depth
i
desired
there
was
a
of
bank
that
rose
vertically
above
the
surface
and
this
was
sufficient
to
shelter
either
my
own
head
as
i
stood
erect
or
the
frontlet
of
my
horse
should
the
channel
continue
of
uniform
depth
as
far
as
the
camp
the
approach
would
be
easy
indeed
and
for
certain
hydrographic
reasons
i
was
under
the
belief
it
would
the
plumes
of
the
indian
bonnet
rose
above
the
level
of
the
and
as
the
feathers
dyed
of
gay
colours
would
have
formed
a
conspicuous
object
i
took
off
the
gaudy
and
carried
it
in
my
hand
i
also
raised
the
robe
of
over
my
shoulders
in
order
to
keep
it
dry
and
for
the
same
reason
temporarily
carried
my
pistols
above
the
the
making
of
these
slight
alterations
occupied
only
a
minute
or
so
and
as
soon
as
they
were
completed
i
moved
forward
through
the
water
the
very
depth
of
the
stream
proved
a
circumstance
in
my
favour
in
wading
both
horse
and
man
make
less
noise
in
deep
than
in
shallow
water
and
this
was
an
important
consideration
the
night
was
still
too
still
for
my
wishes
and
the
plunging
sound
would
have
been
heard
afar
off
but
fortunately
there
were
rapids
below
just
where
the
stream
forced
its
way
through
the
spur
of
the
hill
and
the
hissing
sough
of
these
louder
in
the
still
night
was
borne
upon
the
air
to
the
distance
of
many
miles
their
noise
to
my
own
ears
almost
drowned
the
plashing
made
by
moro
and
myself
i
had
noted
this
before
embarking
upon
the
enterprise
at
the
distance
of
two
hundred
yards
from
the
bushes
i
paused
to
look
back
my
purpose
was
to
fix
in
my
memory
the
direction
of
the
hill
and
more
especially
the
point
where
my
comrades
had
been
left
in
ambush
in
the
event
of
a
close
pursuit
it
would
not
do
to
mistake
their
exact
situation
i
easily
made
out
the
place
and
observed
that
for
several
reasons
a
better
could
not
have
been
chosen
the
trees
that
timbered
the
crest
of
the
hill
were
of
a
peculiar
kind
none
more
so
upon
the
earth
they
were
a
species
of
arborescent
yucca
then
unknown
to
botanists
many
of
them
were
forty
feet
in
height
and
their
thick
angular
branches
and
terminal
fascicles
of
rigid
leaves
outlined
against
the
sky
formed
a
singular
almost
an
unearthly
spectacle
it
was
unlike
any
other
vegetation
upon
earth
more
resembling
a
grove
of
than
a
wood
of
exogenous
trees
why
i
regarded
the
spot
as
favourable
for
an
ambush
was
chiefly
this
a
party
approaching
it
from
the
plain
and
climbing
the
hill
might
fancy
a
host
of
enemies
in
their
front
for
the
trees
themselves
with
their
heads
of
radiating
blades
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
an
array
of
plumed
gigantic
warriors
many
of
the
yuccas
were
only
six
feet
in
height
with
tufted
heads
and
branchless
trunks
as
gross
as
the
body
of
a
man
and
they
might
readily
have
been
mistaken
for
human
beings
i
perceived
at
a
glance
the
advantage
of
the
position
should
the
indians
pursue
me
and
i
could
succeed
in
reaching
the
timber
before
them
a
volley
from
my
comrades
would
check
the
pursuers
however
numerous
the
nine
rifles
would
be
enough
with
a
few
shots
from
the
revolvers
the
savages
would
fancy
nine
hundred
under
the
mystifying
shadows
of
that
grove
with
confidence
strengthened
by
these
considerations
i
once
more
turned
my
face
and
breasting
the
current
waded
on
chapter
ninety
one
my
progress
was
far
from
being
rapid
the
water
was
occasionally
deeper
or
shallower
but
generally
rising
above
my
hips
deep
enough
to
render
my
advance
a
task
of
time
and
difficulty
the
current
was
of
course
against
me
and
though
not
very
swift
seriously
impeded
me
i
could
have
advanced
more
rapidly
but
for
the
necessity
of
keeping
my
head
and
that
of
my
horse
below
the
escarpment
of
the
bank
at
times
it
was
a
close
fit
with
scarcely
an
inch
to
spare
and
in
several
places
i
was
compelled
to
move
with
my
neck
bent
and
my
horse
nose
held
close
down
to
the
surface
of
the
water
at
intervals
i
paused
to
rest
myself
for
the
exertion
of
wading
against
the
current
wearied
me
and
took
away
my
breath
this
was
particularly
the
case
when
i
required
to
go
in
a
crouching
attitude
but
i
chose
my
where
the
channel
was
deepest
and
where
i
could
stand
erect
i
was
all
the
while
anxious
to
look
up
and
take
a
survey
of
the
camp
i
wished
to
ascertain
its
distance
and
position
but
i
dared
not
raise
my
head
above
the
level
of
the
bank
the
sward
that
crowned
it
was
smooth
as
a
mown
meadow
and
the
of
the
turf
even
and
unbroken
had
i
shown
but
my
hand
above
it
it
might
have
been
seen
in
that
clear
white
light
i
dared
not
show
either
hand
or
head
i
had
advanced
i
knew
not
how
far
but
i
fancied
i
must
be
near
the
lines
all
the
way
i
had
kept
close
under
the
left
bank
which
as
rube
had
predicted
now
rose
a
full
above
the
this
was
a
favourable
circumstance
and
another
equally
so
was
the
fact
that
the
moon
on
that
the
eastern
side
was
yet
low
in
the
sky
and
consequently
the
bank
flung
a
broad
black
shadow
that
extended
nearly
across
the
stream
in
this
shadow
i
walked
and
its
friendly
darkness
sheltered
both
myself
and
my
horse
i
fancied
i
must
be
near
the
lines
and
longed
to
reconnoitre
them
but
for
the
reasons
already
given
dared
not
i
was
equally
afraid
to
make
any
farther
advance
for
that
might
be
still
more
perilous
i
had
already
noted
the
direction
of
the
wind
it
blew
the
river
and
the
camp
and
should
i
bring
my
horse
opposite
the
line
of
the
mustangs
i
would
then
be
directly
to
windward
of
them
and
in
danger
from
their
keen
nostrils
they
would
be
almost
certain
to
take
up
the
scent
of
my
steed
and
utter
their
warning
snorts
the
breeze
was
light
but
so
much
the
worse
there
was
sufficient
to
carry
the
smell
and
not
enough
to
drown
the
plunging
noise
necessarily
made
by
my
horse
moving
through
the
water
with
the
occasional
hollow
pounding
of
his
hoofs
upon
the
rocks
at
the
bottom
if
i
raised
my
head
over
the
bank
there
was
the
danger
of
being
seen
if
i
advanced
the
prospect
was
one
of
equal
peril
of
being
scented
for
some
moments
i
stood
hesitating
uncertain
as
to
whether
i
should
leave
my
horse
or
lead
him
a
little
farther
i
heard
noises
from
the
camp
but
they
were
not
distinct
enough
to
guide
me
i
looked
back
down
the
river
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
calculate
the
distance
i
had
come
and
by
that
means
decide
where
i
was
but
my
observation
furnished
no
data
by
which
i
could
determine
my
position
with
my
eyes
almost
on
a
level
with
the
surface
of
the
water
i
could
not
judge
satisfactorily
of
distance
i
turned
my
face
again
and
scrutinised
the
parapet
line
of
the
bank
just
then
i
saw
an
object
over
its
edge
that
answered
well
to
guide
me
it
was
the
croup
and
of
a
horse
one
of
the
mustangs
staked
near
the
bank
i
saw
neither
the
head
nor
shoulders
of
the
animal
its
were
towards
the
stream
its
head
was
to
the
grass
it
was
browsing
the
sight
gratified
me
the
mustang
was
full
two
hundred
yards
above
the
point
i
had
reached
i
knew
that
its
position
marked
the
outer
line
of
the
encampment
i
was
in
the
very
place
where
i
wanted
to
be
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
lines
just
at
that
distance
i
desired
to
leave
my
horse
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
bring
with
me
my
one
of
the
essentials
of
the
prairie
traveller
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
to
delve
it
into
the
bank
i
needed
not
to
drive
it
with
violence
my
steed
never
broke
fastening
however
slight
with
him
the
stake
was
only
required
as
a
sign
that
he
was
not
free
to
wander
in
a
moment
then
he
was
staked
and
with
a
whisper
i
parted
from
him
and
kept
on
i
had
not
waded
a
dozen
yards
farther
when
i
perceived
a
break
in
the
line
of
the
bank
it
was
a
little
that
led
slantingly
from
the
level
of
the
prairie
down
to
the
bed
of
the
stream
its
counterpart
i
perceived
on
the
opposite
side
the
two
indicated
a
ford
or
crossing
used
by
buffaloes
and
other
denizens
of
the
prairie
at
first
i
viewed
it
with
apprehension
i
feared
it
might
uncover
my
body
to
the
eyes
of
the
enemy
but
on
coming
opposite
my
fears
were
allayed
the
slope
was
abrupt
and
the
high
ground
screened
me
as
before
there
would
be
no
danger
in
passing
the
place
as
i
was
about
moving
on
an
idea
arrested
me
and
i
paused
to
regard
the
gully
with
a
look
of
greater
interest
i
perceived
an
advantage
in
it
i
had
been
troubled
about
the
position
in
which
i
had
left
my
horse
should
i
succeed
in
getting
back
of
course
it
would
be
under
the
pressure
of
a
hot
pursuit
and
my
steed
was
not
conveniently
placed
his
back
was
below
the
level
of
the
bank
he
might
easily
be
mounted
but
how
should
i
get
him
out
of
the
channel
of
the
stream
only
by
a
desperate
leap
might
he
reach
the
plain
above
but
he
might
fail
in
the
effort
time
might
be
lost
when
time
and
speed
would
be
most
wanted
i
had
been
troubled
with
this
thought
it
need
trouble
me
no
longer
the
crossing
afforded
easy
access
either
to
or
from
the
bed
of
the
river
the
very
thing
i
wanted
i
was
not
slow
to
profit
by
the
discovery
i
turned
back
and
having
released
the
rein
led
my
horse
gently
up
to
the
break
choosing
a
spot
under
the
highest
part
of
the
bank
i
fastened
him
as
before
and
again
left
him
i
now
moved
with
more
ease
and
confidence
but
with
increased
caution
i
was
getting
too
near
to
risk
making
the
slightest
noise
in
the
water
a
single
plash
might
betray
me
it
was
my
intention
to
keep
within
the
channel
until
i
had
passed
the
point
where
the
horses
were
staked
by
so
doing
i
should
avoid
crossing
the
line
of
the
and
what
was
quite
as
important
that
of
the
horses
themselves
for
i
was
equally
apprehensive
of
being
discovered
by
the
latter
once
inside
their
circle
they
would
take
no
notice
of
me
for
doubtless
there
would
be
other
indians
within
sight
and
i
trusted
to
my
semblance
of
savagery
to
deceive
the
eyes
of
these
equine
sentinels
i
did
not
wish
to
go
far
beyond
their
line
that
would
bring
me
in
front
of
the
camp
itself
too
near
its
fires
and
its
idle
groups
i
had
noticed
before
starting
that
there
was
a
broad
belt
between
the
place
occupied
by
the
men
and
that
where
their
horses
were
staked
this
neutral
ground
was
little
used
by
the
camp
loungers
and
somewhere
on
the
edge
of
it
i
was
desirous
of
making
my
i
succeeded
to
my
utmost
wishes
closely
hugging
the
bank
i
passed
the
browsing
mustangs
under
their
very
noses
i
glided
past
for
i
could
hear
them
munching
the
herbage
right
over
me
but
so
silently
did
i
steal
along
that
neither
snort
nor
heralded
my
advance
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
sufficiently
beyond
them
for
my
purpose
i
raised
my
head
slowly
and
gently
i
raised
it
till
my
eyes
were
above
the
level
of
the
prairie
slope
no
one
was
near
i
could
see
the
swarth
savages
grouped
around
their
fires
but
they
were
a
hundred
yards
off
or
more
they
were
capering
and
talking
and
laughing
but
no
ear
was
bent
and
no
eye
seemed
turned
towards
me
no
one
was
near
i
grasped
the
bank
with
my
hands
and
drew
myself
up
slowly
and
silently
i
ascended
like
some
demon
from
the
dark
of
a
stage
on
my
knees
i
reached
the
level
of
the
turf
and
then
gently
rising
to
my
feet
i
stood
erect
within
the
limits
of
the
indian
camp
to
all
appearance
as
complete
a
savage
as
any
upon
the
ground
chapter
ninety
two
of
the
camp
for
some
minutes
i
stood
motionless
as
a
statue
i
stirred
neither
hand
nor
foot
lest
the
movement
should
catch
the
eye
either
of
the
or
those
moving
around
the
fires
i
had
already
donned
my
plumed
before
climbing
out
of
the
channel
and
after
getting
on
the
bank
my
first
thought
was
to
replace
my
pistols
in
the
belt
behind
my
back
the
movement
was
stealthily
made
and
with
like
stealthy
action
i
suffered
the
mantle
of
to
drop
from
my
shoulders
and
hang
to
its
full
length
i
had
saved
the
robe
from
getting
wet
and
its
ample
skirt
now
served
me
in
concealing
my
soaked
as
well
as
the
upper
half
of
my
leggings
these
and
the
moccasins
were
of
course
saturated
with
water
but
i
had
not
much
uneasiness
about
that
in
a
prairie
camp
and
upon
the
banks
of
a
deep
stream
an
indian
with
wet
leggings
could
not
be
a
spectacle
to
excite
suspicion
there
would
be
many
reasons
why
my
counterpart
might
choose
to
immerse
his
extremities
in
the
river
moreover
the
buckskin
dressed
was
speedily
casting
the
water
it
would
soon
drip
dry
or
even
if
wet
would
scarcely
be
observed
under
such
a
light
the
spot
where
i
had
landed
chanced
to
be
one
of
the
least
conspicuous
in
the
whole
area
of
the
camp
i
was
just
between
two
lights
the
red
glare
of
the
campfires
and
the
mellower
beams
of
the
moon
and
the
atmospheric
confusion
occasioned
by
the
meeting
of
the
distinct
kinds
of
light
favoured
me
by
producing
a
species
of
optical
delusion
it
was
but
slight
and
i
could
easily
be
seen
from
the
centre
of
the
camp
but
not
with
sufficient
distinctness
for
my
disguise
to
be
penetrated
by
any
one
therefore
it
was
hardly
probable
that
any
of
the
savages
would
approach
or
trouble
their
heads
about
me
i
might
pass
for
one
of
themselves
indulging
in
a
solitary
saunter
yielding
himself
to
a
moment
of
abstraction
or
melancholy
i
was
well
enough
acquainted
with
indian
life
to
know
that
there
was
nothing
or
unlikely
in
this
behaviour
such
conduct
was
perfectly
i
did
not
remain
long
on
that
spot
only
long
enough
to
catch
the
salient
features
of
the
scene
i
saw
there
were
many
fires
and
around
each
was
grouped
number
of
human
forms
some
squatted
some
standing
the
night
was
cold
enough
to
make
them
draw
near
to
the
burning
logs
and
for
this
reason
but
few
were
wandering
about
a
fortunate
circumstance
for
me
there
was
one
fire
larger
than
the
rest
from
its
dimensions
it
might
be
termed
a
bonfire
such
as
is
made
by
the
flattering
and
flunkeyish
peasantry
of
lands
when
they
welcome
home
the
squire
and
the
count
it
was
placed
directly
in
front
of
the
solitary
tent
and
not
a
dozen
paces
from
its
entrance
its
blazing
pile
gave
forth
a
flood
of
red
light
that
reached
even
to
the
spot
where
i
stood
and
flickered
in
my
face
i
even
fancied
i
could
feel
its
glow
upon
my
cheeks
around
this
fire
were
many
forms
of
men
all
of
them
standing
up
i
could
see
the
faces
of
those
who
were
upon
its
farther
side
but
only
the
figures
of
these
on
the
nearer
the
former
i
could
see
with
almost
as
much
distinctness
as
if
i
had
been
close
beside
them
i
could
trace
the
lineaments
of
their
features
the
painted
devices
on
their
breasts
and
faces
the
style
of
their
habiliments
the
sight
of
these
last
somewhat
astonished
me
i
had
expected
to
see
warriors
in
leggings
moccasins
and
with
heads
naked
or
plumed
and
shoulders
draped
under
brown
robes
of
some
such
there
were
but
not
all
of
them
were
so
costumed
on
the
contrary
i
beheld
savages
shrouded
in
serapes
and
cloaks
of
broadcloth
with
calzoneros
on
their
legs
and
upon
their
heads
huge
hats
of
black
glaze
regular
mexican
sombreros
in
short
i
beheld
numbers
of
them
in
full
mexican
costume
others
again
were
dressed
somewhat
in
a
military
fashion
with
helmets
or
stiff
shakos
uniform
coats
of
red
or
blue
cloth
oddly
contrasting
with
the
brown
buckskin
that
covered
their
legs
and
feet
with
some
astonishment
i
observed
these
fancy
dresses
but
my
surprise
passed
away
when
i
reflected
upon
who
were
the
men
before
me
and
whence
they
had
lately
come
where
they
had
been
and
on
what
errand
it
was
no
travesty
but
a
scene
of
actual
life
the
savages
were
clad
in
the
spoils
they
had
captured
from
civilisation
i
need
not
have
been
at
such
pains
with
my
toilet
under
any
guise
i
could
scarcely
have
looked
odd
in
the
midst
of
such
a
motley
crew
even
my
own
uniform
might
have
passed
muster
all
except
the
colour
of
my
skin
fortunately
a
few
of
the
band
still
preserved
their
native
costume
a
few
appeared
in
full
paint
and
plumes
else
i
should
have
been
for
such
a
company
it
cost
not
a
minute
to
note
these
peculiarities
nor
did
i
stay
to
observe
them
minutely
my
eyes
were
in
search
of
isolina
i
cast
inquiring
glances
on
all
sides
i
scrutinised
the
groups
around
the
different
fires
i
saw
others
women
whom
i
knew
to
be
captives
but
i
saw
not
her
i
scanned
their
forms
and
the
faces
of
those
who
were
turned
towards
me
a
glance
would
have
been
enough
i
could
easily
have
recognised
her
face
under
the
firelight
under
any
light
it
was
not
before
me
in
the
tent
in
the
tent
she
must
be
there
i
determined
to
move
away
from
the
spot
where
i
had
hitherto
been
standing
my
eye
quickened
by
the
necessity
of
action
had
fallen
upon
the
copse
that
stretched
along
the
entire
background
of
the
camp
at
a
glance
i
detected
the
advantage
offered
by
its
shadowy
cover
the
tent
as
already
stated
was
placed
close
to
the
edge
of
the
timber
and
in
front
of
the
tent
was
the
great
fire
plainly
this
was
the
gravitating
point
the
centre
of
motive
and
motion
if
aught
of
interest
was
to
be
enacted
there
would
lie
the
scene
in
the
lodge
or
near
it
would
she
be
found
certainly
she
would
be
there
and
there
i
resolved
to
seek
her
chapter
ninety
three
a
friendly
encounter
just
then
the
shrill
voice
of
a
crier
pealed
through
the
camp
and
i
observed
a
general
movement
i
could
not
make
out
what
the
man
said
but
the
peculiar
intonation
told
that
he
was
uttering
some
signal
or
summons
something
of
importance
was
about
to
transpire
the
indians
now
commenced
circling
around
the
blazing
pile
meeting
and
passing
each
other
as
if
threading
the
mazes
of
some
silent
and
solemn
dance
others
were
seen
hastening
up
from
distant
parts
of
the
camp
as
if
to
observe
the
actions
of
those
around
the
fire
or
join
with
them
in
the
movement
i
did
not
wait
to
watch
them
their
attention
thus
occupied
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
reaching
the
copse
unobserved
and
without
further
ado
i
started
towards
it
i
walked
slowly
and
with
an
assumed
air
of
careless
indifference
i
counterfeited
the
comanche
walk
not
that
bold
free
port
the
magnificent
and
inimitable
stride
so
characteristic
of
chippewa
and
shawano
of
huron
and
iroquois
but
the
shuffling
gingery
step
of
an
english
jockey
for
such
in
reality
is
the
gait
of
the
comanche
indian
when
afoot
i
must
have
played
my
part
well
a
savage
crossing
from
the
towards
the
great
fire
passed
near
me
and
hailed
me
by
name
cried
he
well
what
matter
i
replied
in
spanish
imitating
as
well
as
i
could
the
indian
voice
and
accent
it
was
a
venture
but
i
was
taken
at
a
strait
and
could
not
well
remain
silent
the
man
appeared
some
little
surprised
at
being
addressed
in
the
language
of
mexico
nevertheless
he
understood
it
and
made
rejoinder
you
hear
the
summons
wakono
why
do
you
not
come
forward
the
council
meets
is
already
there
i
understood
what
was
said
more
from
the
indian
gestures
than
his
speech
though
the
words
summons
council
and
the
name
helped
me
to
comprehend
his
meaning
i
chanced
to
know
the
comanche
epithets
for
the
two
first
and
also
that
the
spanish
wolf
was
the
indian
appellation
of
the
mexican
renegade
though
i
understood
what
was
said
i
was
not
prepared
with
a
reply
i
dared
not
risk
the
answer
in
spanish
for
i
knew
not
the
extent
of
wakono
proficiency
in
the
andalusian
tongue
i
felt
myself
in
a
dilemma
and
the
importunate
savage
no
doubt
some
friend
of
wakono
himself
appeared
determined
to
stick
to
me
how
was
i
to
get
rid
of
him
a
happy
idea
came
to
my
relief
assuming
an
air
of
extreme
dignity
and
as
though
i
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
in
my
meditations
i
raised
my
hand
and
waved
the
man
a
parting
salute
at
the
same
time
turning
my
head
i
walked
slowly
away
the
indian
accepted
the
and
moved
off
but
evidently
with
an
air
of
reluctance
as
i
glanced
back
over
my
shoulder
i
could
see
him
parting
from
the
spot
with
a
hesitating
step
no
doubt
somewhat
astonished
at
the
strange
behaviour
of
his
friend
wakono
i
did
not
look
back
again
until
i
had
placed
myself
under
the
shadow
of
the
timber
then
i
turned
to
reconnoitre
my
friend
had
continued
on
i
saw
him
just
entering
among
the
crowd
that
circled
around
the
great
fire
screened
from
observation
by
the
shadow
i
could
now
pause
and
reflect
the
trifling
incident
that
had
caused
me
some
apprehension
had
also
helped
me
to
some
useful
knowledge
first
i
had
learned
my
own
name
second
that
a
council
was
about
to
take
place
and
thirdly
that
the
renegade
had
something
to
do
with
the
council
this
was
knowledge
of
importance
combined
with
my
previous
information
everything
was
now
made
clear
this
council
could
be
no
other
than
the
between
the
renegade
and
the
yet
nameless
chief
the
same
that
was
to
decide
to
which
belonged
the
right
of
property
in
my
betrothed
it
was
about
to
meet
it
had
not
assembled
as
yet
then
had
i
arrived
in
time
neither
white
savage
nor
red
savage
had
yet
come
into
possession
neither
had
dared
to
lay
hand
on
the
coveted
and
priceless
gem
isolina
was
still
safe
thus
singularly
preserved
from
brutal
contact
these
dogs
in
the
manger
their
mutual
jealousy
had
proved
her
protection
i
was
consoled
by
the
thought
strange
source
of
consolation
i
was
in
time
but
where
was
she
from
my
new
position
i
had
a
still
better
view
of
the
camp
its
fires
and
its
denizens
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
in
the
lodge
then
she
must
certainly
be
there
or
a
new
suspicion
occurred
to
me
she
may
be
kept
apart
from
the
other
captives
in
the
copse
she
may
be
concealed
in
the
copse
until
the
sentence
be
pronounced
this
last
conjecture
brought
along
with
it
hopes
and
resolves
i
determined
to
search
the
copse
if
i
should
find
her
there
my
emprise
would
be
easy
indeed
at
all
events
easier
than
i
had
anticipated
though
guarded
by
the
savages
i
should
rescue
her
from
their
grasp
the
lives
of
six
men
perhaps
twice
that
number
were
under
my
belt
the
odds
of
unarmed
numbers
would
be
nothing
against
the
deadly
bullets
from
my
revolvers
and
i
perceived
too
that
most
of
the
savages
had
laid
aside
their
weapons
confident
in
the
security
of
their
camp
but
i
might
find
her
alone
or
perhaps
with
but
a
single
jailer
the
meeting
of
the
council
favoured
the
supposition
the
men
would
all
be
there
some
to
take
part
others
interested
in
the
result
or
merely
from
curiosity
to
watch
the
proceedings
yes
of
them
would
have
an
interest
in
the
issue
too
surely
all
the
barbarous
customs
of
these
savage
brutes
at
that
moment
came
to
my
remembrance
i
stayed
no
longer
to
reflect
but
gliding
into
the
grove
commenced
my
search
for
the
captive
the
ground
was
favourable
to
my
progress
there
was
not
much
underwood
and
the
trees
grew
thinly
i
could
easily
pass
amongst
them
without
the
necessity
of
crouching
and
without
making
noise
the
silent
tread
of
the
moccasin
was
in
my
favour
as
also
the
dark
shadowy
foliage
that
stretched
overhead
hiding
the
sky
from
my
view
the
chief
timber
of
the
copse
was
the
pecan
hickory
almost
an
evergreen
and
the
trees
were
still
in
full
leaf
only
here
and
there
where
the
trunks
stood
far
apart
did
the
moonbeams
strike
through
the
thick
frondage
the
surface
of
the
ground
was
shrouded
from
her
light
and
the
narrow
aisles
through
which
i
passed
were
as
dark
as
if
no
moon
had
been
shining
there
was
still
light
enough
to
reveal
some
horrid
scenes
o
heaven
my
heart
bleeds
at
the
remembrance
i
was
wrong
in
my
conjectures
the
men
had
not
gone
to
the
council
the
captive
women
were
not
by
the
i
beheld
ruffian
men
beside
their
helpless
victims
women
fair
white
women
with
drooping
heads
and
listless
air
dishevelled
weeping
o
heaven
my
heart
bleeds
at
the
remembrance
it
recoiled
at
the
sight
it
burned
with
indignation
at
every
turn
did
it
prompt
me
to
draw
knife
or
pistol
at
every
step
my
fingers
itched
to
immolate
a
hideous
brute
to
slay
a
noble
savage
i
was
restrained
only
by
my
own
desperate
situation
by
my
apprehensions
for
the
safety
of
isolina
now
more
acute
than
ever
what
horrid
imaginings
crowded
into
my
brain
begot
by
the
barbarous
scenes
that
were
being
enacted
around
me
the
monsters
too
earnestly
occupied
with
their
captives
took
no
heed
of
me
and
i
passed
on
without
interruption
i
threaded
the
pathways
of
the
grove
one
after
another
gliding
through
as
rapidly
as
the
path
would
permit
i
entered
every
aisle
and
glade
i
sought
everywhere
even
to
the
farthest
limits
of
the
wood
i
saw
more
men
more
weeping
women
more
red
ruffianism
i
saw
nought
of
her
for
whom
i
searched
in
the
tent
then
must
be
i
turned
my
face
towards
the
lodge
and
moving
with
stealthy
step
soon
arrived
among
the
trees
that
stood
in
the
rear
i
halted
near
the
edge
and
separating
the
leaves
with
my
hands
peered
cautiously
through
i
had
no
need
to
search
further
isolina
was
before
my
eyes
chapter
ninety
four
the
council
yes
there
was
my
betrothed
within
sight
within
hearing
almost
within
reach
of
my
hands
and
i
dared
not
touch
i
dared
not
speak
i
scarcely
dared
look
upon
her
my
fingers
trembled
among
the
leaves
my
heart
rose
and
fell
i
could
feel
within
my
breast
its
strokes
rapid
and
irregular
i
could
hear
its
sonorous
vibration
it
was
not
at
the
first
glance
that
i
saw
isolina
on
looking
through
the
leaves
the
was
a
scene
that
quite
astonished
me
and
for
a
while
occupied
my
attention
since
i
had
last
gazed
upon
the
great
fire
the
grouping
around
it
had
undergone
an
entire
change
a
new
tableau
was
presented
that
for
the
moment
held
me
under
a
spell
of
surprise
the
fire
no
longer
blazed
or
only
slightly
and
when
stirred
the
logs
had
burned
into
coals
and
now
yielded
a
fainter
light
but
one
more
red
and
garish
it
was
steady
nevertheless
and
the
vastness
of
the
pile
rendered
it
strong
enough
to
illumine
the
to
its
utmost
limits
the
fire
was
still
encircled
by
savages
but
no
longer
standing
nor
grouped
irregularly
as
i
had
before
observed
them
on
the
contrary
they
were
seated
or
rather
squatted
at
equal
distances
from
each
other
and
forming
a
ring
that
girdled
the
huge
mound
of
embers
there
were
about
twenty
of
these
men
i
did
not
count
them
but
i
observed
that
all
were
in
their
native
costume
leggings
and
to
the
waist
nothing
above
save
the
armlets
and
of
nose
ears
and
neck
all
were
profusely
painted
with
chalk
ochre
and
vermilion
beyond
doubt
i
was
looking
upon
the
council
the
other
indians
they
in
fancy
dresses
were
still
upon
the
ground
but
they
were
standing
behind
retired
a
pace
or
two
from
the
circle
and
in
groups
of
two
three
or
four
talking
in
low
mutterings
others
were
moving
about
at
a
still
greater
distance
from
the
fire
my
observation
of
all
these
features
of
the
scene
did
not
occupy
ten
seconds
of
time
just
so
long
as
my
eyes
were
getting
accustomed
to
the
light
at
the
end
of
that
interval
my
glance
rested
upon
isolina
and
there
became
fixed
my
fingers
trembled
among
the
leaves
my
heart
rose
and
fell
i
could
feel
within
my
breast
its
strokes
rapid
and
irregular
i
could
hear
its
sonorous
vibration
in
the
chain
of
indians
that
encircled
the
fire
there
was
a
break
an
interval
of
ten
or
a
dozen
feet
it
was
directly
in
front
of
the
lodge
and
the
fire
for
the
ground
gently
sloped
from
the
tent
towards
the
stream
in
this
spot
the
captive
was
seated
her
situation
was
exactly
between
the
lodge
and
the
fire
and
a
little
retired
behind
the
circle
of
the
council
the
tent
intervening
between
her
and
my
position
had
prevented
me
from
seeing
her
at
first
she
was
upon
a
robe
of
wolfskins
i
saw
that
her
arms
were
free
i
saw
that
her
limbs
were
bound
her
back
was
to
the
tent
her
face
turned
towards
the
council
i
could
not
see
it
to
recognise
my
betrothed
i
did
not
need
to
look
upon
her
face
her
matchless
form
outlined
against
the
red
embers
was
easily
identified
the
full
round
curve
of
the
neck
the
oval
lines
of
the
head
the
majestic
sweep
of
the
shoulders
the
arms
smooth
and
symmetrical
all
these
were
familiar
to
my
eyes
for
oft
had
they
dwelt
on
them
in
admiration
i
could
not
be
mistaken
the
form
before
me
was
that
graven
upon
my
heart
it
was
isolina
there
was
another
salient
point
in
this
singular
tableau
that
could
not
escape
observation
beyond
the
fire
and
directly
opposite
to
where
isolina
was
placed
i
saw
another
object
the
white
steed
he
was
not
staked
there
but
haltered
and
held
in
hand
by
one
of
the
indians
he
must
have
been
lately
brought
upon
the
ground
for
from
neither
of
my
former
points
of
observation
had
i
noticed
him
he
like
his
mistress
was
on
trial
his
ownership
was
also
matter
of
dispute
there
was
in
sight
one
more
object
that
interested
me
not
with
friendly
interest
did
i
regard
it
but
with
disgust
and
indignation
not
seated
in
the
council
ring
nor
standing
among
the
idle
groups
but
apart
from
all
i
beheld
the
renegade
savage
as
were
the
red
warriors
as
they
appeared
with
their
visages
not
one
looked
so
savage
or
as
he
the
features
of
this
man
were
naturally
bad
but
the
paint
for
he
had
adopted
this
with
every
other
vile
custom
of
barbarian
life
rendered
their
expression
positively
ferocious
the
device
upon
his
forehead
was
a
and
done
in
white
chalk
and
upon
his
breast
appeared
the
semblance
of
a
bleeding
scalp
the
appropriate
symbols
of
a
cruel
disposition
there
was
something
unnatural
in
a
white
skin
thus
disfigured
for
the
native
complexion
was
not
hidden
here
and
there
it
could
be
perceived
forming
the
ground
of
the
motley
elaboration
its
pallid
hue
in
strange
contrast
with
the
deeper
colours
that
daubed
it
it
was
not
the
canvas
for
such
a
picture
yet
there
the
picture
was
in
red
and
yellow
black
white
and
blue
there
stood
the
villain
i
saw
not
his
rival
i
looked
for
him
but
saw
him
not
perhaps
he
was
one
of
those
who
stood
around
perhaps
he
had
not
yet
come
up
he
was
the
son
of
the
perhaps
he
was
inside
the
lodge
the
last
was
the
most
probable
conjecture
the
great
calumet
was
brought
forward
and
lit
by
the
fire
it
was
passed
around
the
circle
from
mouth
to
mouth
each
savage
satisfying
himself
with
a
single
draw
from
its
tube
i
knew
that
this
was
the
inauguration
of
the
council
the
trial
was
about
to
proceed
chapter
ninety
five
measuring
the
chances
the
situation
in
which
i
was
placed
by
chance
could
not
have
been
better
had
i
deliberately
chosen
it
i
had
under
my
eyes
the
council
fire
and
council
the
groups
around
in
short
the
whole
area
of
the
camp
what
was
of
most
importance
i
could
see
without
being
seen
along
the
edge
of
the
copse
there
extended
a
narrow
belt
of
shadow
similar
to
that
which
had
favoured
me
while
in
the
channel
and
produced
by
a
like
cause
for
the
stream
and
the
selvage
of
the
grove
were
parallel
to
each
other
the
moonbeams
fell
obliquely
upon
the
grove
and
under
the
thick
foliage
of
the
pecans
i
was
well
screened
from
her
light
behind
while
the
lodge
covered
me
from
the
glare
of
the
fire
in
front
i
could
not
have
been
better
placed
for
my
purpose
i
saw
the
advantage
of
the
position
and
resolved
therefore
to
abide
in
it
the
observations
and
reflections
thus
given
in
detail
occupied
me
but
a
few
minutes
of
time
thought
is
quick
and
at
that
crisis
mine
was
more
than
usually
on
the
alert
almost
instantaneously
did
i
perceive
the
points
that
most
interested
me
or
had
reference
to
my
plans
almost
instantaneously
i
had
mastered
the
situation
and
i
next
bent
my
mind
upon
the
way
to
take
advantage
of
it
i
saw
there
was
but
one
way
to
proceed
my
original
scheme
must
be
carried
cut
under
so
many
eyes
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
that
the
captive
could
be
away
she
must
be
taken
openly
and
by
a
bold
stroke
of
this
was
i
convinced
the
question
arose
when
should
i
make
the
attempt
at
that
moment
she
was
not
ten
paces
from
where
i
stood
could
i
rush
forward
and
with
my
knife
set
free
her
limbs
might
we
then
get
off
before
the
savages
could
fling
themselves
upon
us
hopeless
impossible
she
was
too
near
them
she
was
too
near
the
renegade
who
claimed
her
as
his
property
he
was
standing
almost
over
her
within
distance
of
a
single
leap
in
his
belt
i
saw
the
long
triangular
blade
of
a
spanish
knife
he
could
have
cut
me
down
ere
i
could
have
severed
a
cord
of
her
fastenings
the
attempt
would
fail
success
was
hopeless
impossible
i
must
wait
for
a
better
opportunity
and
i
waited
i
remembered
rube
last
word
of
counsel
not
to
act
too
hastily
and
his
reasons
that
if
i
must
make
a
desprit
strike
for
it
to
leave
the
grand
to
the
last
moment
the
circumstances
could
be
no
more
unfavourable
then
than
now
under
the
influence
of
this
idea
i
checked
my
impatience
and
waited
i
watched
i
watched
the
squatted
forms
around
the
fire
i
watched
the
straggling
groups
behind
them
in
turn
my
eyes
wandered
from
one
to
the
other
at
intervals
too
they
rested
upon
isolina
up
to
this
moment
i
had
not
seen
her
countenance
i
saw
only
the
reverse
of
that
beautiful
image
so
deeply
graven
upon
my
heart
but
even
then
under
that
suspense
of
peril
strange
thoughts
were
passing
within
me
i
felt
a
singular
longing
to
look
upon
her
face
i
remembered
the
it
pleased
fortune
to
smile
upon
me
so
many
little
incidents
were
occurring
in
my
favour
that
i
began
to
believe
the
fates
propitious
and
my
hopes
of
success
were
growing
stronger
apace
just
then
the
captive
turned
her
head
and
her
face
was
towards
me
there
was
no
mark
on
that
fair
brow
that
soft
cheek
was
without
a
scar
the
delicate
skin
was
intact
smooth
and
diaphanous
as
ever
the
herredero
had
been
merciful
perhaps
something
had
occurred
to
interrupt
or
hinder
him
from
his
horrid
work
i
prayed
that
the
matador
had
met
with
a
similar
interruption
i
could
not
tell
those
profuse
clusters
covered
all
neck
bosom
and
shoulders
all
were
hidden
under
the
dark
dishevelment
i
could
not
tell
but
i
did
not
dare
to
hope
cyprio
had
seen
the
blood
it
was
but
a
momentary
glance
and
her
face
was
again
turned
away
at
intervals
she
repeated
it
and
i
saw
that
she
looked
in
other
directions
i
could
note
the
uneasiness
of
her
manner
i
could
tell
why
those
glances
were
given
i
knew
her
design
o
for
one
word
in
her
hearing
one
whisper
it
might
not
be
she
was
too
closely
watched
jealous
eyes
were
upon
her
savage
hearts
were
gloating
over
her
beauty
no
word
could
have
reached
her
that
would
not
have
been
heard
by
others
by
all
around
the
fire
for
the
silence
was
profound
the
council
had
not
yet
essayed
to
speak
the
stillness
was
at
length
broken
by
the
voice
of
a
crier
who
in
a
shrill
tone
proclaimed
that
the
council
was
in
session
there
was
something
so
ceremonious
in
the
whole
proceedings
and
every
movement
was
made
with
such
regularity
that
but
for
the
open
air
the
fire
the
wild
savage
costumes
and
fierce
painted
faces
i
might
have
fancied
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
civilised
court
and
witnessing
a
trial
by
jury
it
was
in
effect
just
such
a
trial
though
judge
there
was
none
the
members
of
the
jury
were
themselves
the
judges
for
in
the
simplicity
of
such
primitive
litigation
each
was
presumed
to
understand
the
law
without
an
interpreter
pleaders
too
were
equally
absent
each
party
plaintiff
and
defendant
was
expected
to
plead
his
own
case
such
is
the
simple
fashion
in
the
high
court
of
the
prairies
a
fashion
which
might
elsewhere
be
adopted
with
advantage
the
name
of
pealed
upon
the
air
the
crier
was
calling
him
into
court
another
parallel
with
the
customs
of
civilisation
three
times
the
name
was
pronounced
at
each
repetition
in
louder
voice
than
before
the
man
might
have
spared
his
breath
he
who
was
summoned
was
upon
the
spot
and
ready
to
answer
before
the
echo
died
away
the
renegade
uttered
a
response
and
stepping
to
an
open
space
within
the
ring
halted
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
folded
his
arms
and
in
this
attitude
stood
waiting
at
that
crisis
the
thought
occurred
to
me
whether
i
should
rash
forward
and
at
once
decide
the
fate
of
myself
and
my
betrothed
the
seated
warriors
appeared
to
be
all
unarmed
and
the
renegade
whose
hand
i
most
regarded
was
now
farther
off
having
gone
round
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
the
situation
was
favourable
and
for
a
moment
i
stood
straining
upon
the
spring
but
my
eye
fell
upon
the
spectators
in
the
background
many
of
them
were
directly
in
the
way
i
should
have
to
take
i
saw
that
many
of
them
carried
weapons
either
in
their
hands
or
upon
their
persons
and
himself
was
still
too
near
i
could
never
fight
my
way
against
such
odds
i
could
not
break
such
a
line
it
would
be
madness
to
attempt
it
rube
counsel
was
again
ringing
in
my
ears
and
once
more
i
abandoned
the
rash
design
chapter
ninety
six
the
chief
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
a
dramatic
pause
that
lasted
for
more
than
a
minute
it
was
ended
by
one
of
the
council
rising
to
his
feet
and
by
a
gesture
inviting
to
speak
the
renegade
began
red
warriors
of
the
hietan
brothers
what
i
have
to
say
before
the
council
will
not
require
many
words
i
claim
yonder
mexican
girl
as
my
captive
and
therefore
as
my
own
who
denies
my
right
i
claim
the
white
horse
as
mine
my
prize
fairly
taken
the
speaker
paused
as
if
to
wait
for
further
commands
from
the
council
has
spoken
his
claim
to
the
mexican
maiden
and
the
white
steed
he
has
not
said
upon
what
right
he
rests
it
let
him
declare
his
right
in
presence
of
the
council
this
was
said
by
the
same
indian
who
had
made
the
gesture
and
who
appeared
to
direct
the
proceedings
he
was
not
acting
by
any
superior
authority
which
he
may
have
possessed
but
merely
by
reason
of
his
being
the
oldest
of
the
party
among
the
indians
age
gives
precedence
brothers
continued
in
obedience
to
the
command
my
claim
is
just
of
that
you
are
to
be
the
judges
i
know
your
true
hearts
you
will
not
shut
them
against
justice
i
need
not
read
to
you
your
own
law
that
he
who
makes
a
captive
has
the
right
to
keep
it
to
do
with
it
as
he
will
this
is
the
law
of
your
tribe
of
my
tribe
as
well
for
yours
is
mine
grunts
of
approbation
caused
a
momentary
interruption
in
the
speech
hietans
resumed
the
speaker
my
skin
is
white
but
my
heart
is
the
colour
of
your
own
you
did
me
the
honour
to
adopt
me
into
your
nation
you
honoured
me
by
making
me
first
a
warrior
and
afterwards
a
have
i
ever
given
you
cause
to
regret
what
you
have
done
have
i
ever
betrayed
your
trust
a
volley
of
exclamations
indicated
a
response
in
the
negative
i
have
confidence
then
in
your
love
of
justice
and
truth
i
have
no
fear
that
the
colour
of
my
skin
will
blind
your
eyes
for
you
all
know
the
colour
of
my
heart
fresh
signs
of
approbation
followed
this
adroit
stroke
of
eloquence
then
brothers
listen
to
my
cause
i
claim
the
maiden
and
the
horse
i
need
not
tell
where
they
were
found
and
how
your
own
eyes
were
witnesses
of
their
capture
there
has
been
talk
of
a
doubt
as
to
who
made
it
for
many
horsemen
were
in
the
pursuit
i
deny
that
there
is
any
doubt
my
lazo
was
first
over
the
head
of
the
horse
was
first
tightened
around
his
throat
first
brought
him
to
a
stand
to
take
the
horse
was
to
take
the
rider
it
was
my
deed
both
are
my
captives
i
claim
both
as
my
property
who
is
he
that
disputes
my
claim
let
him
stand
forth
having
delivered
this
challenge
with
a
defiant
emphasis
the
speaker
fell
back
into
his
former
attitude
and
once
more
folding
his
arms
remained
silent
and
immobile
another
pause
followed
which
was
again
terminated
by
a
sign
from
the
old
warrior
who
had
first
spoken
this
gesture
was
directed
to
the
crier
who
the
moment
after
raising
his
shrill
voice
called
out
the
name
caused
me
to
start
as
if
struck
by
an
arrow
it
was
my
own
appellation
i
was
wakono
it
was
pronounced
thrice
each
time
louder
than
the
preceding
wakono
wakono
wakono
a
light
flashed
upon
me
wakono
was
the
rival
claimant
he
whose
was
around
my
hips
whose
robe
hung
from
my
shoulders
whose
plumed
bonnet
adorned
my
head
whose
pigments
disfigured
my
face
he
of
the
red
hand
upon
his
breast
and
the
cross
upon
his
brow
was
no
other
than
wakono
i
can
not
describe
the
singular
sensation
i
felt
at
this
discovery
i
was
in
a
perilous
position
indeed
my
fingers
trembled
among
the
leaves
i
released
the
branchlets
and
let
them
close
up
before
my
face
i
dared
not
trust
myself
to
look
forth
for
some
moments
i
stood
still
and
silent
but
not
without
trembling
i
could
not
steady
my
nerves
under
such
a
dread
agitation
i
listened
but
looked
not
there
was
an
interval
of
breathless
silence
no
one
seemed
to
stir
or
speak
they
were
waiting
the
effect
of
the
summons
once
more
the
voice
of
the
crier
was
heard
pronouncing
in
triple
repetition
wakono
wakono
wakono
again
followed
an
interval
of
silence
but
i
could
hear
low
mutterings
of
surprise
and
disappointment
as
soon
as
it
was
perceived
that
the
indian
did
not
answer
to
his
name
i
alone
knew
the
reason
of
his
absence
i
knew
that
wakono
not
the
true
wakono
that
his
counterfeit
not
come
though
i
had
undertaken
to
personate
the
savage
chieftain
for
this
act
in
the
drama
i
was
not
prepared
the
stage
must
wait
even
at
that
moment
i
was
sensible
of
the
ludicrousness
of
the
situation
so
extreme
was
it
that
even
at
that
moment
of
direst
peril
i
felt
a
half
inclination
for
laughter
but
the
feeling
was
easily
checked
and
once
more
parting
the
branches
i
ventured
to
look
forth
i
saw
there
was
some
confusion
wakono
had
been
reported
missing
the
members
of
the
council
still
preserved
both
their
seats
and
stoical
composure
but
the
younger
warriors
behind
were
uttering
harsh
ejaculations
and
moving
about
from
place
to
place
with
that
restless
air
that
betokens
at
once
surprise
and
disappointment
at
this
crisis
an
indian
was
seen
emerging
from
the
tent
he
was
a
man
of
somewhat
venerable
aspect
though
venerable
more
from
age
than
any
positive
expression
of
virtue
his
cheeks
were
furrowed
by
time
and
his
hair
white
as
bleached
flax
a
rare
sight
among
indians
there
was
something
about
this
individual
that
bespoke
him
a
person
of
authority
wakono
was
the
son
of
the
chief
the
chief
then
should
be
an
old
man
this
must
be
he
i
had
no
doubt
of
it
and
my
conjecture
proved
to
be
correct
the
indian
stepped
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
ring
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
commanded
silence
the
command
was
instantly
obeyed
the
murmurings
ceased
and
all
placed
themselves
in
fixed
attitudes
to
listen
chapter
ninety
seven
speeches
in
council
hietans
began
the
chief
for
such
in
reality
was
the
old
indian
my
children
and
brothers
in
council
i
appeal
to
you
to
stay
judgment
in
this
matter
i
am
your
chief
but
i
claim
no
consideration
on
that
account
wakono
is
my
son
but
for
him
i
ask
no
favour
i
demand
only
justice
and
right
such
as
would
be
given
to
the
humblest
in
on
tribe
i
ask
no
more
for
my
son
wakono
wakono
is
a
brave
warrior
who
among
you
does
not
know
it
his
shield
is
garnished
with
many
trophies
taken
from
the
hated
his
leggings
are
fringed
with
scalps
of
the
utah
and
cheyenne
at
his
heels
drag
the
long
locks
of
the
pawnee
and
arapaho
who
will
deny
that
wakono
my
son
wakono
is
a
brave
warrior
a
murmur
of
assent
was
the
response
to
this
paternal
appeal
the
spanish
wolf
too
is
a
warrior
a
brave
warrior
i
deny
it
not
he
is
stout
of
heart
and
strong
of
arm
he
has
taken
many
scalps
from
the
enemies
of
the
hietan
i
honour
him
for
his
achievements
who
among
us
does
not
a
general
chorus
of
ughs
and
other
ejaculations
from
both
council
and
spectators
responded
to
this
interrogatory
the
response
both
in
tone
and
manner
was
strongly
in
the
affirmative
and
i
could
tell
by
this
that
the
renegade
not
wakono
was
the
favourite
the
old
chief
also
perceived
that
such
was
the
prevailing
sentiment
and
despite
his
pretensions
to
he
was
evidently
nettled
at
the
reply
the
father
of
wakono
was
undoubtedly
no
brutus
after
a
momentary
pause
he
resumed
speech
but
in
a
tone
entirely
altered
he
was
now
painting
the
reverse
side
of
portrait
and
as
he
threw
in
the
darker
touches
it
was
with
evident
pique
and
hostility
i
honour
the
spanish
wolf
he
continued
i
honour
him
for
his
strong
arm
and
his
stout
heart
i
have
said
so
but
hear
me
hietans
hear
me
children
and
brothers
there
are
two
of
every
kind
there
is
a
night
and
a
day
a
winter
and
a
summer
a
green
prairie
and
a
desert
plain
and
like
these
is
the
tongue
of
it
speaks
two
ways
that
differ
as
the
light
from
the
darkness
it
is
double
it
forks
like
the
tongue
of
the
it
is
not
to
be
believed
the
chief
ceased
speaking
and
the
spanish
wolf
was
permitted
to
make
reply
he
did
not
attempt
to
defend
himself
from
the
charge
of
the
double
tongue
perhaps
he
knew
that
the
accusation
was
just
enough
and
he
had
no
reason
to
tremble
for
his
popularity
on
that
score
he
must
have
been
a
great
liar
indeed
to
have
excelled
or
even
equalled
the
most
ordinary
in
the
comanche
nation
for
the
mendacity
of
these
indians
would
have
been
a
match
for
sparta
herself
the
renegade
did
not
even
deny
the
aspersion
he
seemed
to
be
confident
in
his
case
he
simply
replied
if
the
tongue
of
is
double
let
not
the
council
rely
upon
his
words
let
witnesses
be
called
there
are
many
who
are
ready
to
testify
to
the
truth
of
what
has
spoken
first
hear
wakono
let
wakono
be
heard
where
is
wakono
these
demands
were
made
by
various
members
of
the
council
who
spoke
simultaneously
once
more
the
crier
voice
was
heard
calling
wakono
brothers
again
spoke
the
chief
it
is
for
this
i
would
stay
your
judgment
my
son
is
not
in
the
camp
he
went
back
upon
the
trail
and
has
not
returned
i
know
not
his
purpose
my
heart
is
in
doubt
but
not
in
fear
wakono
is
a
strong
warrior
and
can
take
care
of
himself
he
will
not
be
long
absent
he
must
soon
return
for
this
i
ask
you
to
delay
the
judgment
a
murmur
of
disapprobation
followed
this
avowal
the
allies
of
the
renegade
evidently
mustered
stronger
than
the
friends
of
the
young
chief
once
more
addressed
the
council
what
trifling
would
this
be
warriors
of
the
hietan
two
suns
have
gone
down
and
this
question
is
not
decided
i
ask
only
justice
by
our
laws
the
judgment
can
not
stand
over
the
captives
must
belong
to
some
one
i
claim
them
as
mine
and
i
offer
witnesses
to
prove
my
right
wakono
has
no
claim
else
why
is
he
not
here
to
avow
it
he
has
no
proofs
beyond
his
own
word
he
is
ashamed
to
stand
before
you
without
proof
that
is
why
he
is
now
absent
from
the
camp
wakono
is
not
absent
cried
a
voice
from
among
the
bystanders
he
is
in
the
camp
this
announcement
produced
a
sensation
and
i
could
perceive
that
the
old
chief
partook
equally
with
the
others
of
the
surprise
created
who
says
wakono
is
in
the
camp
inquired
he
in
a
loud
voice
an
indian
stepped
forth
from
the
crowd
of
spectators
i
recognised
the
man
whom
i
had
met
crossing
from
the
wakono
is
in
the
camp
repeated
he
as
he
paused
outside
the
circle
i
saw
the
young
chief
i
spoke
with
him
when
only
now
where
the
man
pointed
to
the
scene
of
our
accidental
rencontre
he
was
going
yonder
said
he
he
went
among
the
trees
i
saw
him
not
after
this
intelligence
evidently
increased
the
astonishment
it
could
not
be
comprehended
why
wakono
should
be
upon
the
ground
and
yet
not
come
forward
to
assert
his
claim
had
he
abandoned
it
altogether
the
father
of
the
claimant
appeared
as
much
puzzled
as
any
one
he
made
no
attempt
to
explain
the
absence
of
his
son
he
could
not
he
stood
silent
and
evidently
in
a
state
of
mystification
several
now
suggested
that
a
search
be
made
for
the
absent
warrior
it
was
proposed
to
send
messengers
throughout
the
camp
search
the
my
blood
ran
cold
as
i
listened
to
the
proposal
my
knees
trembled
beneath
me
i
knew
that
if
the
grove
was
to
be
searched
i
should
have
no
chance
of
remaining
longer
concealed
the
dress
of
wakono
was
conspicuous
i
saw
that
there
was
none
other
like
it
no
other
wore
a
robe
of
and
this
would
betray
me
even
the
paint
would
not
avail
i
should
be
led
into
the
firelight
the
counterfeit
would
be
detected
i
should
be
butchered
upon
the
spot
perhaps
tortured
for
the
treatment
we
had
given
the
true
wakono
which
would
soon
become
known
my
apprehensions
had
reached
the
climax
of
acuteness
when
they
were
suddenly
relieved
by
some
words
from
the
spanish
wolf
why
search
for
wakono
cried
he
wakono
knows
his
own
name
it
has
been
called
and
loud
enough
wakono
has
ears
surely
he
can
hear
for
himself
if
he
be
in
the
camp
call
him
again
if
you
will
this
proposition
appeared
reasonable
it
was
adopted
and
the
crier
once
more
summoned
the
young
chief
by
name
the
voice
as
all
perceived
could
have
been
heard
to
the
farthest
bounds
of
the
camp
and
far
beyond
an
interval
was
allowed
during
which
there
reigned
perfect
silence
every
one
bending
his
ears
to
listen
there
came
no
answer
no
wakono
appeared
to
the
summons
now
triumphantly
exclaimed
the
renegade
is
it
not
as
i
have
said
warriors
i
demand
your
judgment
there
was
no
immediate
reply
a
long
pause
followed
during
which
no
one
spoke
either
in
the
circle
or
among
the
spectators
at
length
the
oldest
of
the
council
rose
the
calumet
and
after
taken
a
whiff
from
the
tube
handed
it
to
the
indian
seated
on
his
left
this
one
in
like
manner
passed
it
to
the
next
and
he
to
the
next
until
the
pipe
had
made
the
circuit
of
the
fire
and
was
returned
to
the
old
warrior
who
had
first
smoked
from
it
the
latter
now
laid
aside
the
pipe
and
in
a
formal
manner
but
in
a
voice
inaudible
to
the
spectators
proposed
the
question
the
vote
was
taken
in
rotation
and
was
also
delivered
the
judgment
only
was
pronounced
aloud
the
decision
was
singular
and
somewhat
unexpected
the
jury
had
been
moved
by
a
strong
leaning
towards
equity
and
an
amicable
adjustment
that
might
prove
acceptable
to
all
parties
the
was
adjudged
to
wakono
the
was
declared
the
property
of
the
spanish
wolf
chapter
ninety
eight
a
rough
courtship
the
decision
appeared
to
give
satisfaction
to
all
a
grim
smile
upon
his
face
testified
that
the
renegade
himself
was
pleased
how
could
he
be
otherwise
he
had
certainly
the
best
of
the
suit
for
what
was
a
beautiful
horse
to
a
beautiful
woman
and
such
a
woman
even
the
chief
seemed
satisfied
perhaps
of
the
two
the
old
savage
jockey
preferred
the
horse
it
might
have
been
different
had
wakono
been
upon
the
ground
i
was
much
mistaken
if
he
would
so
tamely
have
acquiesced
in
the
decision
yes
the
renegade
was
satisfied
more
than
that
he
was
rejoiced
his
bearing
bespoke
his
consciousness
of
the
possession
of
a
rare
and
thing
he
was
unable
to
conceal
the
gratification
he
felt
and
with
an
air
of
triumph
and
exultation
he
approached
the
spot
where
the
captive
sat
as
soon
as
the
sentence
was
pronounced
the
indians
who
had
been
seated
rose
to
their
feet
the
council
was
dismissed
some
of
the
members
strolled
off
on
their
own
business
others
remained
by
the
great
fire
mixing
among
their
comrades
no
longer
with
the
solemn
gravity
of
councillors
but
chatting
laughing
shouting
and
gesticulating
as
glibly
and
gaily
as
if
they
had
been
an
assemblage
of
french
the
trial
and
its
objects
appeared
to
be
at
once
forgotten
neither
plaintiff
defendant
nor
cause
seemed
any
longer
to
occupy
the
thoughts
of
any
one
the
horse
had
been
delivered
to
a
friend
of
wakono
the
maiden
to
and
the
thing
was
settled
and
over
perhaps
here
and
there
some
young
brave
with
a
pain
in
his
heart
may
have
bent
wistful
glances
upon
the
lovely
captive
no
doubt
there
were
many
who
looked
with
envious
thoughts
upon
and
his
fortunes
if
so
their
emotions
were
concealed
their
glances
furtive
after
the
council
was
over
no
one
interfered
no
one
seemingly
took
any
interest
either
in
the
renegade
or
his
squaw
they
were
left
to
themselves
and
to
me
from
that
moment
my
eyes
and
thoughts
rested
only
on
them
i
saw
no
one
else
i
thought
of
nothing
else
i
watched
but
the
wolf
and
his
victim
the
old
chief
had
retired
into
the
tent
isolina
was
left
alone
only
a
moment
alone
had
it
been
otherwise
i
should
have
sprung
forward
my
fingers
had
moved
mechanically
towards
my
knife
but
there
was
not
time
in
the
next
instant
stood
beside
her
he
addressed
her
in
spanish
he
did
not
desire
the
others
to
understand
what
was
said
speaking
in
this
language
there
would
be
less
fear
of
them
doing
so
there
was
one
who
listened
to
every
word
listened
not
a
syllable
escaped
me
now
began
he
in
an
exulting
tone
now
dona
isolina
de
vargas
you
have
heard
i
know
you
understand
the
tongue
in
which
the
council
has
spoken
your
tongue
ha
ha
ha
the
brute
was
jeering
her
you
are
mine
soul
and
body
mine
you
have
heard
i
have
heard
was
the
reply
in
a
tone
of
resignation
and
surely
you
are
satisfied
are
you
not
you
should
be
i
am
white
as
yourself
i
have
saved
you
from
the
embrace
of
a
red
indian
surely
you
are
satisfied
with
the
judgment
i
am
satisfied
this
was
uttered
in
the
same
tone
of
resignation
the
answer
somewhat
surprised
me
is
a
lie
rejoined
the
brutal
monster
you
are
playing
false
with
me
sweet
senorita
but
yesterday
you
spoke
words
of
scorn
you
would
scorn
me
still
i
have
no
power
to
scorn
you
i
am
your
captive
carrambo
you
speak
truth
you
have
no
power
either
to
scorn
or
refuse
me
ha
ha
ha
and
as
little
do
i
care
if
you
did
you
may
like
me
or
not
at
your
pleasure
perhaps
you
will
take
to
me
in
time
as
much
as
i
may
wish
it
but
that
will
be
for
consideration
sweet
senorita
meanwhile
you
are
mine
body
and
soul
you
are
mine
and
i
mean
to
enjoy
my
prize
after
my
own
fashion
the
coarse
taunt
caused
my
blood
already
hot
enough
to
boil
within
my
veins
i
grasped
the
haft
of
my
knife
and
like
a
tiger
stood
cowering
on
the
spring
my
intent
was
first
to
cut
down
the
ruffian
and
then
set
free
the
limbs
of
the
captive
with
the
blade
the
chances
were
still
against
me
a
score
of
savages
were
yet
around
the
fire
even
should
he
fall
at
the
first
blow
i
could
not
hope
to
get
clear
but
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
would
have
risked
the
chances
at
that
moment
had
not
my
foot
been
stayed
by
some
words
that
followed
come
exclaimed
the
renegade
speaking
to
his
victim
and
making
sign
for
her
to
follow
him
come
sweet
senorita
this
place
is
too
public
i
would
talk
with
you
elsewhere
i
know
where
there
are
softer
spots
for
that
fair
form
to
recline
upon
pretty
glades
and
arbours
choice
retreats
within
the
shadow
of
the
grove
there
dearest
shall
we
retire
though
hideous
the
signification
of
this
speech
i
joyed
at
hearing
it
it
arrested
my
hand
and
limb
both
of
which
had
been
ready
for
action
the
choice
retreats
within
the
shadow
of
the
grove
promised
a
with
an
effort
therefore
i
restrained
myself
and
resolved
to
wait
i
listened
for
the
reply
of
isolina
i
watched
her
as
well
i
noted
her
every
movement
i
saw
that
she
pointed
to
her
limbs
to
the
around
her
ankles
how
can
i
follow
you
she
inquired
in
a
calm
voice
and
in
a
tone
of
surprise
surely
that
tone
was
feigned
surely
she
meditated
some
design
true
said
the
man
turning
back
and
drawing
the
knife
from
his
belt
carrai
i
had
not
thought
of
that
but
we
shall
soon
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
it
and
in
an
attitude
that
betokened
hesitation
in
this
attitude
he
remained
awhile
gazing
into
the
eyes
of
his
victim
then
as
if
suddenly
changing
his
mind
he
struck
the
knife
back
into
his
sheath
and
at
the
same
time
cried
out
by
the
virgin
i
shall
not
trust
you
you
are
too
free
of
limb
sweet
you
might
try
to
give
me
the
slip
this
is
a
better
plan
come
raise
yourself
up
a
little
higher
so
now
we
go
now
for
the
grove
while
delivering
the
last
words
the
ruffian
bent
himself
over
the
captive
and
placing
his
arm
underneath
wound
it
around
her
waist
he
then
raised
her
upward
until
her
bosom
rested
upon
his
the
bosom
of
my
betrothed
in
juxtaposition
with
the
painted
breast
of
this
worse
than
savage
i
saw
it
and
slew
him
not
i
saw
it
and
kept
cool
i
can
scarcely
tell
why
for
it
is
not
a
characteristic
of
my
nature
my
nerves
from
being
so
much
played
upon
during
the
preceding
hours
had
acquired
the
firmness
of
steel
perhaps
this
enabled
me
to
endure
the
sight
this
combined
with
the
almost
certain
prospect
of
an
improved
opportunity
at
all
events
i
kept
cool
and
remained
in
my
place
though
only
for
a
moment
longer
chapter
ninety
nine
the
crisis
the
renegade
having
raised
the
unresisting
captive
in
his
arms
proceeded
to
carry
her
from
the
spot
he
scarcely
carried
her
her
feet
naked
and
bound
trailed
along
the
grass
both
together
he
passed
the
lodge
and
was
going
towards
the
copse
in
an
oblique
direction
the
savages
who
saw
him
made
no
attempt
to
interfere
shouted
some
lewd
phrases
and
laughed
i
waited
neither
to
see
nor
hear
more
still
keeping
within
the
timber
i
glided
along
its
edge
with
quick
but
noiseless
step
i
went
making
for
the
same
point
towards
which
the
ruffian
ravisher
was
tending
i
arrived
first
and
stooping
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
waited
with
knife
in
hand
firm
grasped
and
ready
his
burden
had
delayed
him
he
had
stopped
midway
to
rest
and
was
now
scarcely
ten
paces
from
the
edge
of
the
grove
with
the
girl
still
in
his
arms
and
apparently
leaning
against
him
there
was
a
momentary
wavering
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
i
should
not
then
rush
forth
and
strike
the
the
chance
seemed
as
good
a
one
as
i
might
get
i
was
about
deciding
in
the
affirmative
when
i
saw
that
had
again
taken
up
his
warden
and
was
moving
towards
me
he
was
making
directly
for
the
spot
where
i
stood
the
crisis
was
near
it
was
even
nearer
than
i
thought
the
man
had
scarcely
made
three
steps
from
the
point
of
rest
when
i
saw
him
stumble
and
fall
to
the
earth
carrying
the
captive
along
with
him
the
fall
appealed
accidental
i
might
have
deemed
it
so
but
for
the
wild
shout
with
which
it
was
accompanied
something
more
than
a
mere
stumble
elicited
that
fearful
cry
there
was
a
short
struggle
upon
the
ground
the
bodies
became
separated
one
was
seen
to
spring
suddenly
back
i
saw
it
was
isolina
there
was
something
in
her
hand
both
moonlight
and
firelight
gleamed
upon
a
crimsoned
blade
she
who
grasped
it
bent
for
an
instant
downward
its
keen
edge
severed
the
thongs
from
her
limbs
and
the
moment
after
she
was
running
in
full
flight
across
the
level
sward
of
the
without
reflection
i
sprang
out
of
the
covert
and
rushed
after
i
passed
the
renegade
who
had
his
feet
and
appeared
but
slightly
wounded
astonishment
as
much
as
aught
else
seemed
to
hold
him
to
the
spot
he
was
shouting
and
swearing
calling
for
help
and
uttering
threats
of
vengeance
i
could
have
slain
him
and
was
to
the
act
but
there
was
no
time
to
stay
i
only
thought
of
overtaking
the
fugitive
and
aiding
her
in
her
flight
the
alarm
was
given
the
camp
was
in
commotion
fifty
savages
were
starting
upon
the
chase
as
we
ran
my
eyes
fell
upon
a
horse
a
white
horse
it
was
the
steed
a
man
was
leading
him
by
a
lazo
he
was
taking
him
from
the
fires
towards
the
ground
occupied
by
the
mustangs
he
was
going
to
picket
him
on
the
grass
horse
and
man
were
directly
in
front
of
us
as
we
ran
in
front
of
the
fugitive
she
was
making
towards
them
i
divined
her
intention
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
up
to
the
horse
and
had
seized
the
rope
the
indian
struggled
and
tried
to
take
it
away
from
her
the
red
blade
gleamed
in
his
eyes
and
he
gave
back
he
still
clung
to
the
rope
but
in
an
instant
it
was
cut
from
his
hands
and
quick
as
thought
the
heroic
woman
leaped
upon
the
back
of
the
steed
and
was
seen
galling
away
the
indian
was
one
of
the
and
was
therefore
armed
he
carried
bow
and
quiver
before
the
horse
had
galloped
beyond
reach
he
had
bent
his
bow
and
sent
an
arrow
from
the
string
i
heard
the
wheep
of
the
shaft
and
fancied
i
heard
it
strike
but
the
steed
kept
on
i
had
plucked
up
one
of
the
long
spears
as
i
ran
across
the
camp
before
the
indian
could
adjust
another
arrow
to
the
string
i
had
thrust
him
in
the
back
i
drew
out
the
spear
and
keeping
the
white
horse
in
view
ran
on
i
was
soon
in
the
midst
of
the
mustangs
many
of
them
had
already
stampeded
and
were
galloping
to
and
fro
over
the
ground
the
guards
were
dismayed
but
as
yet
knew
not
the
cause
of
the
alarm
the
steed
with
his
rider
passed
safely
through
their
line
i
followed
on
foot
and
as
fast
as
i
could
run
fifty
savages
were
after
me
i
could
hear
their
shouts
i
could
hear
them
cry
wakono
but
i
was
soon
far
in
advance
of
all
the
as
i
passed
them
were
shouting
wakono
as
soon
as
i
had
cleared
the
i
again
perceived
the
steed
but
he
was
now
some
distance
off
to
my
joy
he
was
going
in
the
right
direction
straight
for
the
yuccas
upon
the
hill
my
men
would
see
and
intercept
him
i
ran
along
the
stream
with
all
speed
i
reached
the
broken
bank
and
without
stopping
rushed
into
the
gully
for
my
horse
what
was
my
astonishment
to
find
that
he
was
gone
my
noble
steed
gone
and
in
his
place
the
spotted
mustang
of
the
indian
i
looked
up
and
down
the
channel
i
looked
along
its
banks
moro
was
not
in
sight
i
was
puzzled
perplexed
furious
i
knew
no
explanation
of
the
mystery
i
could
think
of
none
who
could
have
done
it
who
my
followers
must
have
done
it
rube
must
have
done
it
but
why
in
my
hot
haste
i
could
find
no
reason
for
this
singular
behaviour
i
had
no
time
to
reflect
not
a
moment
i
drew
the
animal
from
the
water
and
leaping
upon
his
back
rode
out
of
the
channel
as
i
regained
the
level
of
the
plain
i
saw
mounted
men
a
crowd
of
them
coming
from
the
camp
they
were
the
savages
in
pursuit
one
was
far
ahead
of
the
rest
and
before
i
could
turn
my
horse
to
flee
he
was
close
up
to
me
in
the
moonlight
i
easily
recognised
him
it
was
the
renegade
slave
shouted
he
speaking
in
the
comanche
tongue
and
with
furious
emphasis
it
is
you
who
have
planned
this
squaw
coward
you
shall
die
the
white
captive
is
mine
mine
wakono
and
you
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
i
still
carried
the
comanche
spear
my
six
months
service
in
a
now
stood
me
in
stead
the
mustang
behaved
handsomely
and
carried
me
full
tilt
upon
my
foe
in
another
instant
the
renegade
and
his
horse
were
parted
the
former
lay
levelled
upon
the
grass
transfixed
with
the
long
spear
while
the
latter
was
galloping
riderless
over
the
plain
at
this
crisis
i
perceived
the
crowd
coming
up
and
close
to
the
spot
there
were
twenty
or
more
and
i
saw
that
i
should
soon
be
surrounded
a
happy
idea
came
opportunely
to
my
relief
all
along
i
had
observed
that
i
was
mistaken
for
wakono
the
indians
in
the
camp
had
cried
wakono
the
shouted
wakono
as
i
passed
the
pursuers
were
calling
wakono
as
they
rode
up
the
renegade
had
fallen
with
the
name
upon
his
lips
the
spotted
horse
the
robe
of
the
plumed
the
red
hand
the
white
cross
all
proclaimed
me
wakono
i
urged
my
horse
a
length
or
two
forward
and
reined
up
in
front
of
the
pursuers
i
raised
my
arm
and
shook
it
in
menace
before
their
faces
at
the
same
instant
i
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
i
am
wakono
death
to
him
who
follows
i
spoke
in
comanche
i
was
not
so
sure
of
the
correctness
of
my
words
either
of
the
pronunciation
or
the
syntax
but
i
had
the
gratification
to
perceive
that
i
was
understood
perhaps
my
gestures
helped
the
savages
to
comprehend
me
the
meaning
of
these
was
not
to
be
mistaken
from
whatever
cause
the
pursuers
made
no
further
advance
but
one
and
all
drawing
in
their
horses
halted
upon
the
spot
i
stayed
not
for
further
parley
but
wheeling
quickly
round
galloped
away
from
them
as
fast
as
the
mustang
could
carry
me
chapter
one
hundred
the
last
chase
on
facing
towards
the
hill
i
perceived
the
steed
still
not
so
distant
his
white
body
gleaming
under
the
clear
moonlight
could
have
been
easily
distinguished
at
a
far
greater
distance
i
had
expected
to
see
him
much
farther
away
but
after
all
the
tilt
of
lances
and
the
menace
delivered
to
the
pursuing
horsemen
had
scarcely
occupied
a
score
of
seconds
and
he
could
not
in
the
time
have
gone
out
of
sight
he
was
still
running
between
myself
and
the
foot
of
the
hill
apparently
keeping
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
i
put
the
indian
horse
to
his
full
speed
the
point
of
my
knife
served
for
whip
and
spur
i
was
no
longer
encumbered
with
the
spear
it
had
been
left
in
the
body
of
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
steed
but
he
was
fast
closing
in
to
the
timber
that
skirted
the
base
of
the
hill
he
was
nearing
the
bend
where
i
had
taken
to
the
water
and
would
soon
be
hidden
from
my
view
behind
the
bushes
all
at
once
i
saw
him
swerve
and
strike
away
to
the
left
across
the
open
plain
to
my
surprise
i
saw
this
for
i
had
conjectured
that
his
rider
was
aiming
to
reach
the
cover
offered
by
the
thicket
without
waiting
to
think
of
an
explanation
i
headed
the
mustang
into
the
diagonal
line
and
galloped
forward
i
was
in
hopes
of
getting
nearer
by
the
advantage
thus
given
me
but
i
was
ill
satisfied
with
the
creeping
pace
of
the
indian
horse
so
unlike
the
long
free
stretch
of
my
matchless
moro
where
was
he
why
was
i
not
bestriding
him
the
white
steed
soon
shot
clear
of
the
hill
and
was
now
running
upon
the
plain
that
stretched
beyond
it
i
saw
that
i
was
not
gaining
upon
him
on
the
contrary
he
was
every
moment
widening
the
distance
between
us
where
was
moro
why
had
he
been
taken
away
at
that
instant
i
perceived
a
dark
horseman
making
along
the
foot
of
the
ridge
as
if
to
intercept
me
he
was
dashing
furiously
through
the
thicket
that
skirted
the
base
of
the
declivity
i
could
hear
the
bushes
rattling
against
the
flanks
of
his
horse
he
was
evidently
making
all
the
haste
in
his
power
at
the
same
time
aiming
to
keep
concealed
from
the
view
of
those
upon
the
plain
i
recognised
my
horse
and
upon
his
back
the
thin
lank
form
of
the
earless
trapper
we
met
the
moment
after
at
the
point
where
the
thicket
ended
without
a
word
passing
between
us
both
simultaneously
flung
ourselves
to
the
ground
exchanged
horses
and
remounted
thank
heaven
moro
was
at
last
between
my
knees
now
young
fellur
cried
the
trapper
as
i
parted
from
him
gallip
like
hell
an
kitch
up
with
her
we
soon
be
arter
on
yur
trail
all
right
thur
away
i
needed
no
prompting
from
rube
his
speech
was
not
finished
before
i
had
sprung
my
horse
forward
and
was
going
like
the
wind
it
was
only
then
that
i
could
comprehend
why
the
horses
had
been
changed
a
it
was
an
of
the
cunning
trappers
had
i
mounted
my
own
conspicuous
steed
by
the
camp
the
indians
would
in
all
probability
have
suspected
something
and
continued
the
pursuit
it
was
the
spotted
mustang
that
had
enabled
me
to
carry
out
the
counterfeit
i
had
now
beneath
me
a
horse
i
could
depend
upon
and
with
renewed
vigour
i
bent
myself
to
the
chase
for
the
third
time
the
black
and
white
stallions
were
to
make
trial
of
their
speed
for
the
third
time
was
it
to
be
a
struggle
between
these
noble
creatures
would
the
struggle
be
hard
and
long
would
moro
again
be
defeated
such
were
my
reflections
as
i
swept
onward
in
the
pursuit
i
rode
in
silence
i
scarcely
drew
breath
so
keen
were
my
apprehensions
about
the
result
a
long
start
had
the
my
delay
had
thrown
me
far
behind
him
nearly
a
mile
but
for
the
friendly
light
i
should
have
lost
sight
of
him
altogether
but
the
plain
was
open
the
moon
shining
brightly
and
the
form
like
a
meteor
beaconed
me
onward
i
had
not
galloped
far
before
i
perceived
that
i
was
rapidly
gaining
upon
the
steed
surely
he
was
not
running
at
his
fleetest
surely
he
was
going
more
slowly
than
was
his
wont
oh
could
his
rider
but
know
who
was
coming
after
could
she
but
hear
me
i
would
have
called
but
the
distance
was
still
too
great
she
could
not
have
heard
even
my
shouts
how
then
distinguish
my
voice
i
galloped
on
in
silence
i
was
gaining
constantly
and
rapidly
gaining
surely
i
was
drawing
nearer
or
were
my
eyes
playing
false
under
the
light
of
the
moon
i
fancied
that
the
steed
was
running
heavily
slowly
and
heavily
as
if
he
was
labouring
in
the
race
i
fancied
no
it
was
no
fancy
i
was
sure
of
it
beyond
a
doubt
he
was
not
going
at
his
swiftest
speed
what
could
it
mean
was
he
broken
by
fatigue
still
nearer
and
nearer
i
came
until
scarcely
three
hundred
yards
appeared
between
us
my
shout
might
now
be
heard
my
voice
i
called
aloud
i
called
the
name
of
my
betrothed
coupling
it
with
my
own
but
no
answer
came
back
no
sign
of
recognition
to
cheer
me
the
ground
that
lay
between
us
favoured
a
speed
and
i
was
about
putting
my
horse
to
his
full
stretch
when
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
the
white
steed
stagger
forward
and
fall
headlong
to
the
earth
it
did
not
check
my
career
and
in
a
few
seconds
more
i
was
upon
the
spot
and
halting
over
horse
and
rider
still
prostrate
i
flung
myself
from
the
saddle
just
as
isolina
disengaged
herself
and
rose
to
her
feet
with
her
right
hand
clasping
the
red
knife
she
stood
confronting
me
savage
approach
me
not
she
cried
in
the
comanche
tongue
and
with
a
gesture
that
told
her
determination
isolina
i
am
not
it
is
henri
no
words
interrupted
that
wild
embrace
no
sound
could
be
heard
save
that
made
by
our
hearts
as
they
throbbed
closely
together
silently
i
stood
upon
the
plain
with
my
betrothed
in
my
arms
moro
was
by
our
side
proudly
curving
his
neck
and
chafing
the
steel
between
his
foaming
lips
at
our
feet
lay
the
with
the
barb
in
his
vitals
and
the
feathered
shaft
protruding
from
his
side
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
glassy
blood
still
ran
from
his
spread
nostrils
but
his
beautiful
limbs
were
motionless
in
death
horsemen
were
seen
approaching
the
spot
we
did
not
attempt
to
flee
from
them
i
recognised
my
followers
they
came
galloping
up
and
drawing
bridle
sat
silent
in
their
saddles
we
looked
back
over
the
plain
there
was
no
sign
of
pursuit
but
for
all
that
we
did
not
tarry
there
we
knew
not
how
soon
the
indians
might
be
after
us
the
friends
of
might
yet
come
upon
the
trail
of
wakono
we
scarce
gave
a
parting
look
to
that
noble
form
stretched
lifeless
at
our
feet
but
plying
the
spur
rode
rapidly
away
it
was
near
daybreak
when
we
halted
to
rest
and
then
only
after
the
prairie
had
been
fired
behind
us
we
found
shelter
in
a
pretty
grove
of
acacias
and
a
grassy
turf
on
which
to
repose
my
wearied
followers
soon
fell
asleep
i
slept
not
i
watched
over
the
slumbers
of
my
betrothed
her
beautiful
head
rested
upon
my
knees
her
soft
damask
cheek
was
pillowed
upon
the
robe
of
and
my
eyes
were
upon
it
the
thick
tresses
had
fallen
aside
and
i
saw
the
matador
too
had
been
merciful
or
had
gold
bribed
him
from
his
cruel
intent
no
matter
which
he
had
failed
in
his
fiendish
duty
there
in
full
entirety
were
those
delicate
organs
perfect
complete
i
saw
but
the
trifling
scar
where
the
gold
circlet
had
been
rudely
plucked
the
source
of
that
red
haemorrhage
that
had
been
noticed
by
cyprio
i
was
too
happy
to
sleep
it
was
our
last
night
upon
the
prairies
before
the
setting
of
another
sun
we
had
crossed
the
rio
grande
and
arrived
in
the
camp
of
our
army
under
the
broad
protecting
wings
of
the
american
eagle
my
betrothed
could
repose
in
safety
until
that
blissful
hour
when
of
the
comanches
we
never
heard
more
the
story
of
one
only
was
afterwards
told
a
fearful
tale
wakono
a
horrid
end
was
his
an
tale
by
the
prairie
is
that
of
the
skeleton
of
an
indian
warrior
found
clasping
the
trunk
of
a
tree
wakono
had
horribly
perished
we
had
no
design
of
giving
him
to
such
a
fate
without
thought
had
we
acted
and
though
he
may
have
deserved
death
we
had
not
designed
for
him
such
terrible
retribution
perhaps
i
was
the
only
one
who
had
any
remorseful
feeling
but
the
remembrance
of
that
shield
the
scenes
in
that
cyprian
grove
those
weeping
captives
wedded
to
a
woeful
lot
the
remembrance
of
these
cruel
realities
evermore
rose
before
my
mind
stifling
the
remorse
i
should
otherwise
have
felt
for
the
doom
of
the
savage
his
death
though
terrible
in
kind
was
merited
by
his
deeds
and
was
perhaps
as
just
as
punishments
usually
are
poetical
justice
demands
the
death
of
ijurra
and
by
the
hand
of
holingsworth
truth
enables
me
to
satisfy
the
demand
on
my
return
to
the
camp
i
learned
that
the
act
was
already
consummated
the
brother
blood
had
been
avenged
it
was
a
tragic
tale
and
would
take
many
chapters
in
the
telling
i
may
not
give
them
here
let
a
few
particulars
suffice
from
that
dread
night
holingsworth
had
found
a
willing
hand
to
aid
him
in
his
purpose
of
retribution
one
who
yearned
for
vengeance
keenly
as
himself
wheatley
was
the
man
the
two
with
a
chosen
party
had
thrown
themselves
on
the
trail
of
the
guerrilla
and
with
pedro
as
their
guide
had
followed
it
far
within
the
hostile
lines
like
had
they
followed
it
night
and
day
until
they
succeeded
in
tracking
the
guerrilleros
to
their
lair
it
was
a
desperate
conflict
hand
to
hand
and
knife
to
knife
but
the
rangers
at
length
triumphed
most
of
the
guerrilleros
were
slain
and
the
band
nearly
annihilated
ijurra
fell
by
holingsworth
own
hand
while
the
death
of
the
red
ruffian
el
zorro
by
the
bowie
knife
of
the
texan
lieutenant
was
an
appropriate
punishment
for
the
cruelty
inflicted
upon
conchita
the
revenge
of
both
was
complete
though
both
still
bore
the
sorrow
within
their
hearts
the
expedition
of
the
two
lieutenants
was
productive
of
other
fruits
in
the
of
the
guerrilla
they
found
many
prisoners
yankees
and
ayankieados
among
others
that
rare
diplomatist
don
ramon
de
vargas
of
course
the
old
gentleman
was
released
from
captivity
and
had
arrived
at
the
american
camp
just
in
time
to
welcome
his
fair
daughter
and
future
from
their
grand
tour
upon
the
prairies
