preface
the
book
called
consolation
of
philosophy
was
throughout
the
middle
ages
and
down
to
the
beginnings
of
the
modern
epoch
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
scholar
familiar
companion
few
books
have
exercised
a
wider
influence
in
their
time
it
has
been
translated
into
every
european
tongue
and
into
english
nearly
a
dozen
times
from
king
alfred
paraphrase
to
the
translations
of
lord
preston
causton
ridpath
and
duncan
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
belief
that
what
once
pleased
so
widely
must
still
have
some
charm
is
my
excuse
for
attempting
the
present
translation
the
great
work
of
boethius
with
its
alternate
prose
and
verse
skilfully
fitted
together
like
dialogue
and
chorus
in
a
greek
play
is
unique
in
literature
and
has
a
pathetic
interest
from
the
time
and
circumstances
of
its
composition
it
ought
not
to
be
forgotten
those
who
can
go
to
the
original
will
find
their
reward
there
may
be
room
also
for
a
new
translation
in
english
after
an
interval
of
close
on
a
hundred
years
some
of
the
editions
contain
a
reproduction
of
a
bust
purporting
to
represent
boethius
lord
preston
translation
for
example
has
such
a
portrait
which
it
refers
to
an
original
in
marble
at
rome
this
i
have
been
unable
to
trace
and
suspect
that
it
is
apocryphal
the
hope
collection
at
oxford
contains
a
completely
different
portrait
in
a
print
which
gives
no
authority
i
have
ventured
to
use
as
a
frontispiece
a
reproduction
from
a
in
the
ashmolean
museum
taken
from
an
ivory
diptych
preserved
in
the
bibliotheca
quiriniana
at
brescia
which
represents
narius
manlius
boethius
the
father
of
the
philosopher
portraiture
of
this
period
is
so
rare
that
it
seemed
that
failing
a
likeness
of
the
author
himself
this
authentic
representation
of
his
father
might
have
interest
as
giving
the
consular
dress
and
insignia
of
the
time
and
also
as
illustrating
the
decadence
of
contemporary
art
the
consul
wears
a
cloak
his
right
hand
holds
a
staff
surmounted
by
the
roman
eagle
his
left
the
circensis
or
napkin
used
for
starting
the
races
in
the
circus
at
his
feet
are
palms
and
bags
of
money
prizes
for
the
victors
in
the
games
for
permission
to
use
this
cast
my
thanks
are
due
to
the
authorities
of
the
ashmolean
museum
as
also
to
jackson
curator
of
the
hope
collection
who
first
called
my
attention
to
its
existence
i
have
to
thank
my
brother
james
of
radley
college
for
much
valuable
help
and
for
correcting
the
of
the
translation
the
text
used
is
that
of
peiper
leipsic
proem
anicus
manlius
severinus
boethius
lived
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
fifth
century
and
the
first
quarter
of
the
sixth
he
was
growing
to
manhood
when
theodoric
the
famous
ostrogoth
crossed
the
alps
and
made
himself
master
of
italy
boethius
belonged
to
an
ancient
family
which
boasted
a
connection
with
the
legendary
glories
of
the
republic
and
was
still
among
the
foremost
in
wealth
and
dignity
in
the
days
of
abasement
his
parents
dying
early
he
was
brought
up
by
symmachus
whom
the
age
agreed
to
regard
as
of
almost
saintly
character
and
afterwards
became
his
his
varied
gifts
aided
by
an
excellent
education
won
for
him
the
reputation
of
the
most
accomplished
man
of
his
time
he
was
orator
poet
musician
philosopher
it
is
his
peculiar
distinction
to
have
handed
on
to
the
middle
ages
the
tradition
of
greek
philosophy
by
his
latin
translations
of
the
works
of
aristotle
called
early
to
a
public
career
the
highest
honours
of
the
state
came
to
him
unsought
he
was
sole
consul
in
and
was
ultimately
raised
by
theodoric
to
the
dignity
of
magister
officiorum
or
head
of
the
whole
civil
administration
he
was
no
less
happy
in
his
domestic
life
in
the
virtues
of
his
wife
rusticiana
and
the
fair
promise
of
his
two
sons
symmachus
and
boethius
happy
also
in
the
society
of
a
refined
circle
of
friends
noble
wealthy
accomplished
universally
esteemed
for
his
virtues
high
in
the
favour
of
the
gothic
king
he
appeared
to
all
men
a
signal
example
of
the
union
of
merit
and
good
fortune
his
felicity
seemed
to
culminate
in
the
year
when
by
special
and
extraordinary
favour
his
two
sons
young
as
they
were
for
so
exalted
an
honour
were
created
joint
consuls
and
rode
to
the
attended
by
a
throng
of
senators
and
the
acclamations
of
the
multitude
boethius
himself
amid
the
general
applause
delivered
the
public
speech
in
the
king
honour
usual
on
such
occasions
within
a
year
he
was
a
solitary
prisoner
at
pavia
stripped
of
honours
wealth
and
friends
with
death
hanging
over
him
and
a
terror
worse
than
death
in
the
fear
lest
those
dearest
to
him
should
be
involved
in
the
worst
results
of
his
downfall
it
is
in
this
situation
that
the
opening
of
the
of
philosophy
brings
boethius
before
us
he
represents
himself
as
seated
in
his
prison
distraught
with
grief
indignant
at
the
injustice
of
his
misfortunes
and
seeking
relief
for
his
melancholy
in
writing
verses
descriptive
of
his
condition
suddenly
there
appears
to
him
the
divine
figure
of
philosophy
in
the
guise
of
a
woman
of
superhuman
dignity
and
beauty
who
by
a
succession
of
discourses
convinces
him
of
the
vanity
of
regret
for
the
lost
gifts
of
fortune
raises
his
mind
once
more
to
the
contemplation
of
the
true
good

then
i
while
i
was
thus
mutely
pondering
within
myself
and
recording
my
sorrowful
complainings
with
my
pen
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
appeared
above
my
head
a
woman
of
a
countenance
exceeding
venerable
her
eyes
were
bright
as
fire
and
of
a
more
than
human
keenness
her
complexion
was
lively
her
vigour
showed
no
trace
of
enfeeblement
and
yet
her
years
were
right
full
and
she
plainly
seemed
not
of
our
age
and
time
her
stature
was
difficult
to
judge
at
one
moment
it
exceeded
not
the
common
height
at
another
her
forehead
seemed
to
strike
the
sky
and
whenever
she
raised
her
head
higher
she
began
to
pierce
within
the
very
heavens
and
to
baffle
the
eyes
of
them
that
looked
upon
her
her
garments
were
of
an
imperishable
fabric
wrought
with
the
finest
threads
and
of
the
most
delicate
workmanship
and
these
as
her
own
lips
afterwards
assured
me
she
had
herself
woven
with
her
own
hands
the
beauty
of
this
vesture
had
been
somewhat
tarnished
by
age
and
neglect
and
wore
that
dingy
look
which
marble

this

moreover
had
been
torn
by
the
hands
of
violent

who
had
each
snatched
away
what
he
could
clutch

her
right
hand
held
a
in
her
left
she
bore
a
staff
and
when
she
saw
the
muses
of
poesie
standing
by
my
bedside
dictating
the
words
of
my
lamentations
she
was
moved
awhile
to
wrath
and
her
eyes
flashed
sternly
said
she
allowed
yon

approach
this
sick
man

so
far
from

downcast

dimmed
with
much
weeping

not

woman

authority

i
was
dumfoundered
and
with
my
gaze
fastened
on
the
earth
continued
silently
to
await
what
she
might
do
next
then
she
drew
near
me
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
my
couch
and
looking
into
my
face
all
heavy
with
grief
and
fixed
in
sadness
on

me
not

nothing

mute

utterly
incapable
of

she
gently
touched
my

these
are
the
symptoms

obscured
in
starless
night
but
if
in
wild
onset
sweeping
boreas
frees
day
prisoned
light
all
suddenly
the
radiant
god
outstreams
and
strikes
our
dazzled
eyesight
with
his
beams
iii
even
so
the
clouds
of
my
melancholy
were
broken
up
i
saw
the
clear
sky
and
regained
the
power
to
recognise
the
face
of
my
physician
accordingly
when
i
had
lifted
my
eyes
and
fixed
my
gaze
upon
her
i
beheld
my
nurse
philosophy
whose
halls
i
had
frequented
from
my
youth
up
why
i
cried
of
all
excellence
hast
thou
come
down
from
on
high
and
entered
the
solitude
of
this
my
exile
is
it
that
thou
too
even
as
i
mayst
be
persecuted
with
false
accusations
i
desert
thee
child
said
she
not
lighten
the
burden
which
thou
hast
taken
upon
thee
through
the
hatred
of
my
name
by
sharing
this
trouble
even
forgetting
that
it
were
not
lawful
for
philosophy
to
leave
companionless
the
way
of
the
innocent
should
i
thinkest
thou
fear
to
incur
reproach
or
shrink
from
it
as
though
some
strange
new
thing
had
befallen
thinkest
thou
that
now
for
the
first
time
in
an
evil
age
wisdom
hath
been
assailed
by
peril
did
i
not
often
in
days
of
old
before
my
servant
plato
lived
wage
stern
warfare
with
the
rashness
of
folly
in
his
lifetime
too
socrates
his
master
won
with
my
aid
the
victory
of
an
unjust
death
and
when
one
after
the
other
the
epicurean
herd
the
stoic
and
the
rest
each
of
them
as
far
as
in
them
lay
went
about
to
seize
the
heritage
he
left
and
were
dragging
me
off
protesting
and
resisting
as
their
booty
they
tore
in
pieces
the
garment
which
i
had
woven
with
my
own
hands
and
clutching
the
torn
pieces
went
off
believing
that
the
whole
of
me
had
passed
into
their
possession
and
some
of
them
because
some
traces
of
my
vesture
were
seen
upon
them
were
destroyed
through
the
mistake
of
the
lewd
multitude
who
falsely
deemed
them
to
be
my
disciples
it
may
be
thou
knowest
not
of
the
banishment
of
anaxagoras
of
the
poison
draught
of
socrates
nor
of
zeno
torturing
because
these
things
happened
in
a
distant
country
yet
mightest
thou
have
learnt
the
fate
of
arrius
of
seneca
of
soranus
whose
stories
are
neither
old
nor
unknown
to
fame
these
men
were
brought
to
destruction
for
no
other
reason
than
that
settled
as
they
were
in
my
principles
their
lives
were
a
manifest
contrast
to
the
ways
of
the
wicked
so
there
is
nothing
thou
shouldst
wonder
at
if
on
the
seas
of
this
life
we
are
tossed
by
seeing
that
we
have
made
it
our
chiefest
aim
to
refuse
compliance
with
and
though
maybe
the
host
of
the
wicked
is
many
in
number
yet
is
it
contemptible
since
it
is
under
no
leadership
but
is
hurried
hither
and
thither
at
the
blind
driving
of
mad
error
and
if
at
times
and
seasons
they
set
in
array
against
us
and
fall
on
in
overwhelming
strength
our
leader
draws
off
her
forces
into
the
citadel
while
they
are
busy
plundering
the
useless
baggage
but
we
from
our
vantage
ground
safe
from
all
this
wild
work
laugh
to
see
them
making
prize
of
the
most
valueless
of
things
protected
by
a
bulwark
which
aggressive
folly
may
not
aspire
to
reach
song
iv
nothing
can
subdue
virtue
whoso
calm
serene
sedate
sets
his
foot
on
haughty
fate
firm
and
steadfast
come
what
will
keeps
his
mien
unconquered
still
him
the
rage
of
furious
seas
tossing
high
wild
menaces
nor
the
flames
from
smoky
forges
that
vesuvius
disgorges
nor
the
bolt
that
from
the
sky
smites
the
tower
can
terrify
why
then
shouldst
thou
feel
affright
at
the
tyrant
weakling
might
dread
him
not
nor
fear
no
harm
and
thou
shall
his
rage
disarm
but
who
to
hope
or
fear
gives
way
lost
his
bosom
rightful
sway
he
hath
cast
away
his
shield
like
a
coward
fled
the
field
he
hath
forged
all
unaware
fetters
his
own
neck
must
bear
iv
thou
understand
she
asks
do
my
words
sink
into
thy
mind
or
art
thou
dull
as
the
ass
to
the
sound
of
the
lyre
why
dost
thou
weep
why
do
tears
stream
from
thy
eyes
speak
out
hide
it
not
in
thy
heart
if
thou
lookest
for
the
physician
help
thou
must
needs
disclose
thy
wound
then
i
gathering
together
what
strength
i
could
began
there
still
need
of
telling
is
not
the
cruelty
of
fortune
against
me
plain
enough
doth
not
the
very
aspect
of
this
place
move
thee
is
this
the
library
the
room
which
thou
hadst
chosen
as
thy
constant
resort
in
my
home
the
place
where
we
so
often
sat
together
and
held
discourse
of
all
things
in
heaven
and
earth
was
my
garb
and
mien
like
this
when
i
explored
with
thee
nature
hid
secrets
and
thou
didst
trace
for
me
with
thy
wand
the
courses
of
the
stars
moulding
the
while
my
character
and
the
whole
conduct
of
my
life
after
the
pattern
of
the
celestial
order
is
this
the
recompense
of
my
obedience
yet
thou
hast
enjoined
by
plato
mouth
the
maxim
that
states
would
be
happy
either
if
philosophers
ruled
them
or
if
it
should
so
befall
that
their
rulers
would
turn
philosophers
by
his
mouth
likewise
thou
didst
point
out
this
imperative
reason
why
philosophers
should
enter
public
life
to
wit
lest
if
the
reins
of
government
be
left
to
unprincipled
and
profligate
citizens
trouble
and
destruction
should
come
upon
the
good
following
these
precepts
i
have
tried
to
apply
in
the
business
of
public
administration
the
principles
which
i
learnt
from
thee
in
leisured
seclusion
thou
art
my
witness
and
that
divinity
who
hath
implanted
thee
in
the
hearts
of
the
wise
that
i
brought
to
my
duties
no
aim
but
zeal
for
the
public
good
for
this
cause
i
have
become
involved
in
bitter
and
irreconcilable
feuds
and
as
happens
inevitably
if
a
man
holds
fast
to
the
independence
of
conscience
i
have
had
to
think
nothing
of
giving
offence
to
the
powerful
in
the
cause
of
justice
how
often
have
i
encountered
and
balked
conigastus
in
his
assaults
on
the
fortunes
of
the
weak
how
often
have
i
thwarted
trigguilla
steward
of
the
king
household
even
when
his
villainous
schemes
were
as
good
as
accomplished
how
often
have
i
risked
my
position
and
influence
to
protect
poor
wretches
from
the
false
charges
innumerable
with
which
they
were
for
ever
being
harassed
by
the
greed
and
license
of
the
barbarians
no
one
has
ever
drawn
me
aside
from
justice
to
oppression
when
ruin
was
overtaking
the
fortunes
of
the
provincials
through
the
combined
pressure
of
private
rapine
and
public
taxation
i
grieved
no
less
than
the
sufferers
when
at
a
season
of
grievous
scarcity
a
forced
sale
disastrous
as
it
was
unjustifiable
was
proclaimed
and
threatened
to
overwhelm
campania
with
starvation
i
embarked
on
a
struggle
with
the
prætorian
prefect
in
the
public
interest
i
fought
the
case
at
the
king
and
succeeded
in
preventing
the
enforcement
of
the
sale
i
rescued
the
consular
paulinus
from
the
gaping
jaws
of
the
court
bloodhounds
who
in
their
covetous
hopes
had
already
made
short
work
of
his
wealth
to
save
albinus
who
was
of
the
same
exalted
rank
from
the
penalties
of
a
prejudged
charge
i
exposed
myself
to
the
hatred
of
cyprian
the
informer
thou
i
had
laid
up
for
myself
store
of
enmities
enough
well
with
the
rest
of
my
countrymen
at
any
rate
my
safety
should
have
been
assured
since
my
love
of
justice
had
left
me
no
hope
of
security
at
court
yet
who
was
it
brought
the
charges
by
which
i
have
been
struck
down
why
one
of
my
accusers
is
basil
who
after
being
dismissed
from
the
king
household
was
driven
by
his
debts
to
lodge
an
information
against
my
name
there
is
opilio
there
is
gaudentius
men
who
for
many
and
various
offences
the
king
sentence
had
condemned
to
banishment
and
when
they
declined
to
obey
and
sought
to
save
themselves
by
taking
sanctuary
the
king
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
it
decreed
that
if
they
did
not
depart
from
the
city
of
ravenna
within
a
prescribed
time
they
should
be
branded
on
the
forehead
and
expelled
what
would
exceed
the
rigour
of
this
severity
and
yet
on
that
same
day
these
very
men
lodged
an
information
against
me
and
the
information
was
admitted
just
heaven
had
i
deserved
this
by
my
way
of
life
did
it
make
them
fit
accusers
that
my
condemnation
was
a
foregone
conclusion
has
fortune
no
shame
if
not
at
the
accusation
of
the
innocent
at
least
for
the
vileness
of
the
accusers
perhaps
thou
wonderest
what
is
the
sum
of
the
charges
laid
against
me
i
wished
they
say
to
save
the
senate
but
how
i
am
accused
of
hindering
an
informer
from
producing
evidence
to
prove
the
senate
guilty
of
treason
tell
me
then
what
is
thy
counsel
o
my
mistress
shall
i
deny
the
charge
lest
i
bring
shame
on
thee
but
i
did
wish
it
and
i
shall
never
cease
to
wish
it
shall
i
admit
it
then
the
work
of
thwarting
the
informer
will
come
to
an
end
shall
i
call
the
wish
for
the
preservation
of
that
illustrious
house
a
crime
of
a
truth
the
senate
by
its
decrees
concerning
me
has
made
it
such
but
blind
folly
though
it
deceive
itself
with
false
names
can
not
alter
the
true
merits
of
things
and
mindful
of
the
precept
of
socrates
i
do
not
think
it
right
either
to
keep
the
truth
concealed
or
allow
falsehood
to
pass
but
this
however
it
may
be
i
leave
to
thy
judgment
and
to
the
verdict
of
the
discerning
moreover
lest
the
course
of
events
and
the
true
facts
should
be
hidden
from
posterity
i
have
myself
committed
to
writing
an
account
of
the
transaction
need
to
speak
of
the
forged
letters
by
which
an
attempt
is
made
to
prove
that
i
hoped
for
the
freedom
of
rome
their
falsity
would
have
been
manifest
if
i
had
been
allowed
to
use
the
confession
of
the
informers
themselves
evidence
which
has
in
all
matters
the
most
convincing
force
why
what
hope
of
freedom
is
left
to
us
would
there
were
any
i
should
have
answered
with
the
epigram
of
canius
when
caligula
declared
him
to
have
been
cognisant
of
a
conspiracy
against
him
if
i
had
known
said
he
thou
shouldst
never
have
known
grief
hath
not
so
blunted
my
perceptions
in
this
matter
that
i
should
complain
because
impious
wretches
contrive
their
villainies
against
the
virtuous
but
at
their
achievement
of
their
hopes
i
do
exceedingly
marvel
for
evil
purposes
are
perchance
due
to
the
imperfection
of
human
nature
that
it
should
be
possible
for
scoundrels
to
carry
out
their
worst
schemes
against
the
innocent
while
god
beholdeth
is
verily
monstrous
for
this
cause
not
without
reason
one
of
thy
disciples
asked
if
god
exists
whence
comes
evil
yet
whence
comes
good
if
he
exists
not
however
it
might
well
be
that
wretches
who
seek
the
blood
of
all
honest
men
and
of
the
whole
senate
should
wish
to
destroy
me
also
whom
they
saw
to
be
a
bulwark
of
the
senate
and
all
honest
men
but
did
i
deserve
such
a
fate
from
the
fathers
also
thou
rememberest
methinks
since
thou
didst
ever
stand
by
my
side
to
direct
what
i
should
do
or
say
thou
rememberest
i
say
how
at
verona
when
the
king
eager
for
the
general
destruction
was
bent
on
implicating
the
whole
senatorial
order
in
the
charge
of
treason
brought
against
albinus
with
what
indifference
to
my
own
peril
i
maintained
the
innocence
of
its
members
one
and
all
thou
knowest
that
what
i
say
is
the
truth
and
that
i
have
never
boasted
of
my
good
deeds
in
a
spirit
of
for
whenever
a
man
by
proclaiming
his
good
deeds
receives
the
recompense
of
fame
he
diminishes
in
a
measure
the
secret
reward
of
a
good
conscience
what
issues
have
overtaken
my
innocency
thou
seest
instead
of
reaping
the
rewards
of
true
virtue
i
undergo
the
penalties
of
a
guilt
falsely
laid
to
my
charge
nay
more
than
this
never
did
an
open
confession
of
guilt
cause
such
unanimous
severity
among
the
assessors
but
that
some
consideration
either
of
the
mere
frailty
of
human
nature
or
of
fortune
universal
instability
availed
to
soften
the
verdict
of
some
few
had
i
been
accused
of
a
design
to
fire
the
temples
to
slaughter
the
priests
with
impious
sword
of
plotting
the
massacre
of
all
honest
men
i
should
yet
have
been
produced
in
court
and
only
punished
on
due
confession
or
conviction
now
for
my
too
great
zeal
towards
the
senate
i
have
been
condemned
to
outlawry
and
death
unheard
and
undefended
at
a
distance
of
near
five
hundred
miles
away
c
oh
my
judges
well
do
ye
deserve
that
no
one
should
hereafter
be
convicted
of
a
fault
like
mine
even
my
very
accusers
saw
how
honourable
was
the
charge
they
brought
against
me
and
in
order
to
overlay
it
with
some
shadow
of
guilt
they
falsely
asserted
that
in
the
pursuit
of
my
ambition
i
had
stained
my
conscience
with
sacrilegious
acts
and
yet
thy
spirit
indwelling
in
me
had
driven
from
the
chamber
of
my
soul
all
lust
of
earthly
success
and
with
thine
eye
ever
upon
me
there
could
be
no
place
left
for
sacrilege
for
thou
didst
daily
repeat
in
my
ear
and
instil
into
my
mind
the
pythagorean
maxim
follow
after
god
it
was
not
likely
then
that
i
should
covet
the
assistance
of
the
vilest
spirits
when
thou
wert
moulding
me
to
such
an
excellence
as
should
conform
me
to
the
likeness
of
god
again
the
innocency
of
the
inner
sanctuary
of
my
home
the
company
of
friends
of
the
highest
probity
a
revered
at
once
for
his
pure
character
and
his
active
beneficence
shield
me
from
the
very
suspicion
of
sacrilege
yet
atrocious
as
it
is
they
even
draw
credence
for
this
charge
from
i
am
like
to
be
thought
implicated
in
wickedness
on
this
very
account
that
i
am
imbued
with
teachings
and
stablished
in
ways
so
it
is
not
enough
that
my
devotion
to
thee
should
profit
me
nothing
but
thou
also
must
be
assailed
by
reason
of
the
odium
which
i
have
incurred
verily
this
is
the
very
crown
of
my
misfortunes
that
men
opinions
for
the
most
part
look
not
to
real
merit
but
to
the
event
and
only
recognise
foresight
where
fortune
has
crowned
the
issue
with
her
approval
whereby
it
comes
to
pass
that
reputation
is
the
first
of
all
things
to
abandon
the
unfortunate
i
remember
with
chagrin
how
perverse
is
popular
report
how
various
and
discordant
men
judgments
this
only
will
i
say
that
the
most
crushing
of
misfortune
burdens
is
that
as
soon
as
a
charge
is
fastened
upon
the
unhappy
they
are
believed
to
have
deserved
their
sufferings
i
for
my
part
who
have
been
banished
from
all
life
blessings
stripped
of
my
honours
stained
in
repute
am
punished
for
now
methinks
i
see
the
villainous
dens
of
the
wicked
surging
with
joy
and
gladness
all
the
most
recklessly
unscrupulous
threatening
a
new
crop
of
lying
informations
the
good
prostrate
with
terror
at
my
danger
every
ruffian
incited
by
impunity
to
new
daring
and
to
success
by
the
profits
of
audacity
the
guiltless
not
only
robbed
of
their
peace
of
mind
but
even
of
all
means
of
defence
wherefore
i
would
fain
cry
out
footnotes
c
the
distance
from
rome
to
pavia
the
place
of
imprisonment
is
roman
miles
song
boethius
prayer
of

with

thee

thee

its

not
in

to
submit
to
whose
governance
and
to
obey

thou
ignorant

ancient

whereby
it
is
decreed
that
no
one
whatsoever
who
hath
chosen

truly
there
is
no
fear
that
one
who
is

by
its
ramparts
and
defences
should
deserve
to
be
exiled

he
who
has
ceased
to
wish
to
dwell
therein
he
likewise
ceases
to
deserve
to

so

so
it

what
thou
hast

little

with
the
greatness
of
thy
deservings
the
things
laid
to

whereof
thou
hast
spoken
whether
such
as
redound

thy

accusations
are

known
as
for
the
crimes

deceits
of

thou
hast
rightly
deemed
it
fitting
to
pass
them
over
lightly
because
the
popular
voice
hath
better
and
more
fully
pronounced
upon

thou
hast
bitterly
complained
of
the
injustice
of

thou
hast
grieved
over
my
calumniation
and
likewise
hast
lamented
the
damage
to
my

thine

hast
complained

questions
thou
choosest

then
said

world
of

thinkest
thou
it
is
governed
haphazard
and
fortuitously
or
believest
thou
that
there
is
in
it
any
rational
guidance
said
i
no
wise
may
i
deem
that
such
fixed
motions
can
be
determined
by
random
hazard
but
i
know
that
god
the
creator
presideth
over
his
work
nor
will
the
day
ever
come
that
shall
drive
me
from
holding
fast
the
truth
of
this
belief
said
she
didst
even
but
now
affirm
it
in
song
lamenting
that
men
alone
had
no
portion
in
the
divine
care
as
to
the
rest
thou
wert
unshaken
in
the
belief
that
they
were
ruled
by
reason
yet
i
marvel
exceedingly
how
in
spite
of
thy
firm
hold
on
this
opinion
thou
art
fallen
into
sickness
but
let
us
probe
more
deeply
something
or
other
is
missing
i
think
now
tell
me
since
thou
doubtest
not
that
god
governs
the
world
dost
thou
perceive
by
what
means
he
rules
it
scarcely
understand
what
thou
meanest
i
said
less
can
i
answer
thy
question
i
not
say
truly
that
something
is
missing
whereby
as
through
a
breach
in
the
ramparts
disease
hath
crept
in
to
disturb
thy
mind
but
tell
me
dost
thou
remember
the
universal
end
towards
which
the
aim
of
all
nature
is
directed
once
heard
said
i
sorrow
hath
dulled
my
recollection
yet
thou
knowest
whence
all
things
have
proceeded
that
i
know
said
i
have
answered
that
it
is
from
god
how
is
it
possible
that
thou
knowest
not
what
is
the
end
of
existence
when
thou
dost
understand
its
source
and
origin
however
these
disturbances
of
mind
have
force
to
shake
a
man
position
but
can
not
pluck
him
up
and
root
him
altogether
out
of
himself
but
answer
this
also
i
pray
thee
rememberest
thou
that
thou
art
a
man
should
i
not
said
i
canst
thou
say
what
man
is
this
thy
question
whether
i
know
myself
for
a
being
endowed
with
reason
and
subject
to
death
surely
i
do
acknowledge
myself
such
then
she
know
nothing
else
that
thou
art
said
she
know
another
cause
of
thy
disease
one
too
of
grave
moment
thou
hast
ceased
to
know
thy
own
nature
so
then
i
have
made
full
discovery
both
of
the
causes
of
thy
sickness
and
the
means
of
restoring
thy
health
it
is
because
forgetfulness
of
thyself
hath
bewildered
thy
mind
that
thou
hast
bewailed
thee
as
an
exile
as
one
stripped
of
the
blessings
that
were
his
it
is
because
thou
knowest
not
the
end
of
existence
that
thou
deemest
abominable
and
wicked
men
to
be
happy
and
powerful
while
because
thou
hast
forgotten
by
what
means
the
earth
is
governed
thou
deemest
that
fortune
changes
ebb
and
flow
without
the
restraint
of
a
guiding
hand
these
are
serious
enough
to
cause
not
sickness
only
but
even
death
but
thanks
be
to
the
author
of
our
health
the
light
of
nature
hath
not
yet
left
thee
utterly
in
thy
true
judgment
concerning
the
world
government
in
that
thou
believest
it
subject
not
to
the
random
drift
of
chance
but
to
divine
reason
we
have
the
divine
spark
from
which
thy
recovery
may
be
hoped
have
then
no
fear
from
these
weak
embers
the
vital
heat
shall
once
more
be
kindled
within
thee
but
seeing
that
it
is
not
yet
time
for
strong
remedies
and
that
the
mind
is
manifestly
so
constituted
that
when
it
casts
off
true
opinions
it
straightway
puts
on
false

arises
a
cloud
of
confusion
that
disturbs
its

i

now
try
and
disperse
these
mists
by
mild
and
soothing
application
that
so
the
darkness
of
misleading
passion
may
be
scattered

thou
mayst

thereafter
for
awhile
she
remained
silent
and
when
she
had
restored
my
flagging
attention
by
a
moderate
pause
in
her
discourse
she
thus
began
i
have
thoroughly
ascertained
the
character
and
causes
of
thy
sickness
thou
art
pining
with
regretful
longing
for
thy
former
fortune
it
is
the
change
as
thou
deemest
of
this
fortune
that
hath
so
wrought
upon
thy
mind
well
do
i
understand
that
siren
manifold
wiles
the
fatal
charm
of
the
friendship
she
pretends
for
her
victims
so
long
as
she
is
scheming
to
entrap
them
how
she
unexpectedly
abandons
them
and
leaves
them
overwhelmed
with
insupportable
grief
bethink
thee
of
her
nature
character
and
deserts
and
thou
wilt
soon
acknowledge
that
in
her
thou
hast
neither
possessed
nor
hast
thou
lost
aught
of
any
worth
methinks
i
need
not
spend
much
pains
in
bringing
this
to
thy
mind
since
even
when
she
was
still
with
thee
even
while
she
was
caressing
thee
thou
usedst
to
assail
her
in
manly
terms
to
rebuke
her
with
maxims
drawn
from
my
holy
but
all
sudden
changes
of
circumstances
bring
inevitably
a
certain
commotion
of
spirit
thus
it
hath
come
to
pass
that
thou
also
for
awhile
hast
been
parted
from
thy
mind
tranquillity
but
it
is
time
for
thee
to
take
and
drain
a
draught
soft
and
pleasant
to
the
taste
which
as
it
penetrates
within
may
prepare
the
way
for
stronger
potions
wherefore
i
call
to
my
aid
the
sweet
persuasiveness
of
rhetoric
who
then
only
walketh
in
the
right
way
when
she
forsakes
not
my
instructions
and
music
my
handmaid
i
bid
to
join
with
her
singing
now
in
lighter
now
in
graver
strain
is
it
then
poor
mortal
that
hath
cast
thee
into
lamentation
and
mourning
some
strange
unwonted
sight
methinks
have
thine
eyes
seen
thou
deemest
fortune
to
have
changed
towards
thee
thou
mistakest
such
ever
were
her
ways
ever
such
her
nature
rather
in
her
very
mutability
hath
she
preserved
towards
thee
her
true
constancy
such
was
she
when
she
loaded
thee
with
caresses
when
she
deluded
thee
with
the
allurements
of
a
false
happiness
thou
hast
found
out
how
changeful
is
the
face
of
the
blind
goddess
she
who
still
veils
herself
from
others
hath
fully
discovered
to
thee
her
whole
character
if
thou
likest
her
take
her
as
she
is
and
do
not
complain
if
thou
abhorrest
her
perfidy
turn
from
her
in
disdain
renounce
her
for
baneful
are
her
delusions
the
very
thing
which
is
now
the
cause
of
thy
great
grief
ought
to
have
brought
thee
tranquillity
thou
hast
been
forsaken
by
one
of
whom
no
one
can
be
sure
that
she
will
not
forsake
him
or
dost
thou
indeed
set
value
on
a
happiness
that
is
certain
to
depart
again
i
ask
is
presence
dear
to
thee
if
she
can
not
be
trusted
to
stay
and
though
she
will
bring
sorrow
when
she
is
gone
why
if
she
can
not
be
kept
at
pleasure
and
if
her
flight
overwhelms
with
calamity
what
is
this
fleeting
visitant
but
a
token
of
coming
trouble
truly
it
is
not
enough
to
look
only
at
what
lies
before
the
eyes
wisdom
gauges
the
issues
of
things
and
this
same
mutability
with
its
two
aspects
makes
the
threats
of
fortune
void
of
terror
and
her
caresses
little
to
be
desired
finally
thou
oughtest
to
bear
with
whatever
takes
place
within
the
boundaries
of
fortune
demesne
when
thou
hast
placed
thy
head
beneath
her
yoke
but
if
thou
wishest
to
impose
a
law
of
staying
and
departing
on
her
whom
thou
hast
of
thine
own
accord

for
thy

with
thy
daily
complainings
what
wrong
have
i
done
thee
what
goods
of
thine
have
i
taken
from
thee
choose
an
thou
wilt
a
judge
and
let
us
dispute
before
him
concerning
the
rightful
ownership
of
wealth
and
rank
if
thou
succeedest
in
showing
that
any
one
of
these
things
is
the
true
property
of
mortal
man
i
freely
grant
those
things
to
be
thine
which
thou
claimest
when
nature
brought
thee
forth
out
of
thy
mother
womb
i
took
thee
naked
and
destitute
as
thou
wast
i
cherished
thee
with
my
substance
and
in
the
partiality
of
my
favour
for
thee
i
brought
thee
up
somewhat
too
indulgently
and
this
it
is
which
now
makes
thee
rebellious
against
me
i
surrounded
thee
with
a
royal
abundance
of
all
those
things
that
are
in
my
power
now
it
is
my
pleasure
to
draw
back
my
hand
thou
hast
reason
to
thank
me
for
the
use
of
what
was
not
thine
own
thou
hast
no
right
to
complain
as
if
thou
hadst
lost
what
was
wholly
thine
why
then
dost
bemoan
thyself
i
have
done
thee
no
violence
wealth
honour
and
all
such
things
are
placed
under
my
control
my
handmaidens
know
their
mistress
with
me
they
come
and
at
my
going
they
depart
i
might
boldly
affirm
that
if
those
things
the
loss
of
which
thou
lamentest
had
been
thine
thou
couldst
never
have
lost
them
am
i
alone
to
be
forbidden
to
do
what
i
will
with
my
own
unrebuked
the
skies
now
reveal
the
brightness
of
day
now
shroud
the
daylight
in
the
darkness
of
night
the
year
may
now
engarland
the
face
of
the
earth
with
flowers
and
fruits
now
disfigure
it
with
storms
and
cold
the
sea
is
permitted
to
invite
with
smooth
and
tranquil
surface
to
roughen
with
wave
and
storm
shall
man
insatiate
greed
bind
to
a
constancy
foreign
to
my
character
this
is
my
art
this
the
game
i
never
cease
to
play
i
turn
the
wheel
that
spins
i
delight
to
see
the
high
come
down
and
the
low
ascend
mount
up
if
thou
wilt
but
only
on
condition
that
thou
wilt
not
think
it
a
hardship
to
come
down
when
the
rules
of
my
game
require
it
wert
thou
ignorant
of
my
character
didst
not
know
how
croesus
king
of
the
lydians
erstwhile
the
dreaded
rival
of
cyrus
was
afterwards
pitiably
consigned
to
the
flame
of
the
pyre
and
only
saved
by
a
shower
sent
from
heaven
has
it
thee
how
paullus
paid
a
meed
of
pious
tears
to
the
misfortunes
of
king
perseus
his
prisoner
what
else
do
tragedies
make
such
woeful
outcry
over
save
the
overthrow
of
kingdoms
by
the
indiscriminate
strokes
of
fortune
didst
thou
not
learn
in
thy
childhood
how
there
stand
at
the
threshold
of
zeus
jars
one
full
of
blessings
the
other
of
calamities
how
if
thou
hast
drawn
from
the
good
jar
what
if
not
even
now
have
i
departed
wholly
from
thee
what
if
this
very
mutability
of
mine
is
a
just
ground
for
hoping
better
things
but
listen
now
and
cease
to
let
thy
heart
consume
away
with
fretfulness
nor
expect
to
live
on
thine
own
terms
in
a
realm
that
is
common
to
all
song

covetousness
what
though
plenty
pour
her
gifts
with
a
lavish
hand
numberless
as
are
the
stars
countless

the
race
of

murmur
and
lament
nay
though
god
give
gold
at
man

honours
rank
and
fame
content
not
a
whit
is
nigher
but
an
greed
yawns
with
need
then
what
bounds
can
restrain
this
wild
lust
of
having
when
with
each
new
bounty
fed
grows
the
frantic
craving

iii
fortune
should
plead
thus
against
thee
assuredly
thou
wouldst
not
have
one
word
to
offer
in
reply
or
if
thou
canst
find
any
justification
of
thy
complainings
thou
must
show
what
it
is
i
will
give
thee
space
to
speak
then
said
i
thy
pleas
are
plausible
yea
steeped
in
the
honeyed
sweetness
of
music
and
rhetoric
but
their
charm
lasts
only
while
they
are
sounding
in
the
ear
the
sense
of
his
misfortunes
lies
deeper
in
the
heart
of
the
wretched
so
when
the
sound
ceases
to
vibrate
upon
the
air
the
heart
indwelling
sorrow
is
felt
with
renewed
bitterness
then
said
she
is
indeed
as
thou
sayest
for
we
have
not
yet
come
to
the
curing
of
thy
sickness
as
yet
these
are
but
lenitives
conducing
to
the
treatment
of
a
malady
hitherto
obstinate
the
remedies
which
go
deep
i
will
apply
in
due
season
nevertheless
to
deprecate
thy
determination
to
be
thought
wretched
i
ask
thee
hast
thou
forgotten
the
extent
and
bounds
of
thy
felicity
i
say
nothing
of
how
when
orphaned
and
desolate
thou
wast
taken
into
the
care
of
illustrious
men
how
thou
wast
chosen
for
alliance
with
the
highest
in
the
state
and
even
before
thou
wert
bound
to
their
house
by
marriage
wert
already
dear
to
their
love
which
is
the
most
precious
of
all
ties
did
not
all
pronounce
thee
most
happy
in
the
virtues
of
thy
wife
the
splendid
honours
of
her
father
and
the
blessing
of
male
issue
i
pass
over
for
i
care
not
to
speak
of
blessings
in
which
others
also
have
shared
the
distinctions
often
denied
to
age
which
thou
enjoyedst
in
thy
youth
i
choose
rather
to
come
to
the
unparalleled
culmination
of
thy
good
fortune
if
the
fruition
of
any
earthly
success
has
weight
in
the
scale
of
happiness
can
the
memory
of
that
splendour
be
swept
away
by
any
rising
flood
of
troubles
that
day
when
thou
didst
see
thy
two
sons
ride
forth
from
home
joint
consuls
followed
by
a
train
of
senators
and
welcomed
by
the
of
the
people
when
these
two
sat
in
curule
chairs
in
the
and
thou
by
thy
panegyric
on
the
king
didst
earn
the
fame
of
eloquence
and
ability
when
in
the
circus
seated
between
the
two
consuls
thou
didst
glut
the
multitude
thronging
around
with
the
triumphal
largesses
for
which
they
looked
methinks
thou
didst
cozen
fortune
while
she
caressed
thee
and
made
thee
her
darling
thou
didst
bear
off
a
boon
which
she
had
never
before
granted
to
any
private
person
art
thou
then
minded
to
cast
up
a
reckoning
with
fortune
now
for
the
first
time
she
has
turned
a
jealous
glance
upon
thee
if
thou
compare
the
extent
and
bounds
of
thy
blessings
and
misfortunes
thou
canst
not
deny
that
thou
art
still
fortunate
or
if
thou
esteem
not
thyself
favoured
by
fortune
in
that
thy
then
seeming
prosperity
hath
departed
deem
not
thyself
wretched
since
what
thou
now
believest
to
be
calamitous
passeth
also
what
art
thou
but
now
come
suddenly
and
a
stranger
to
the
scene
of
this
life
thinkest
thou
there
is
any
stability
in
human
affairs
when
man
himself
vanishes
away
in
the
swift
course
of
time
it
is
true
that
there
is
little
trust
that
the
gifts
of
chance
will
abide
yet
the
last
day
of
life
is
in
a
manner
the
death
of
all
remaining
fortune
what
difference
then
thinkest
thou
is
there
whether
thou
leavest
her
by
dying
or
she
leave
thee
by
fleeing
away

all
passes
when
in

chariot
drawn
phoebus
to
light
the
dawn
by
his
flaming
beams
assailed
every
glimmering
star
is
paled
when

grove
by
zephyrs

with
blushes

doth
rude
auster
breathe
thereon
bare
it
stands
its
glory
gone
smooth
and

thy

a

whose
splendid

does

unharmed
and
while

bewails
thy

this
rare
nature
in
whom
wisdom

nobly
blended
is

out
of

a
boon
thou
wouldst
have

thy

yet
lives
with
her
gentle
disposition
her
peerless
modesty
and
virtue
this
the
epitome
of
all
her
graces
that
she
is
the
true
daughter
of
her
sire
she
lives
i
say
and
for
thy
sake
only
preserves
the
breath
of
life
though
she
loathes
it
and
pines
away
in
grief
and
tears
for
thy
absence
wherein
if
in
naught
else
i
would
allow
some
marring
of
thy
felicity
what
shall
i
say
of
thy
sons
and
their
consular
dignity
how
in
them
so
far
as
may
be
in
youths
of
their
age
the
example
of
their
father
and
grandfather
character
shines
out
since
then
the
chief
care
of
mortal
man
is
to
preserve
his
life
how
happy
art
thou
couldst
thou
but
recognise
thy
blessings
who
possessest
even
now
what
no
one
doubts
to
be
dearer
than
life
wherefore
now
dry
thy
tears
fortune
hate
hath
not
involved
all
thy
dear
ones
the
stress
of
the
storm
that
has
assailed
thee
is
not
beyond
measure
intolerable
since
there
are
anchors
still
holding
firm
which
suffer
thee
not
to
lack
either
consolation
in
the
present
or
hope
for
the
future
pray
that
they
still
may
hold
for
while
they
still
remain
however
things
may
go
i
shall
ride
out
the
storm
yet
thou
seest
how
much
is
shorn
of
the
splendour
of
my
fortunes
are
gaining
a
little
ground
said
she
there
is
something
in
thy
lot
wherewith
thou
art
not
yet
altogether
discontented
but
i
can
not
stomach
thy
daintiness
when
thou
complainest
with
such
violence
of
grief
and
anxiety
because
thy
happiness
falls
short
of
completeness
why
who
enjoys
such
settled
felicity
as
not
to
have
some
quarrel
with
the
circumstances
of
his
lot
a
troublous
matter
are
the
conditions
of
human
bliss
either
they
are
never
realized
in
full
or
never
stay
permanently
one
has
abundant
riches
but
is
shamed
by
his
ignoble
birth
another
is
conspicuous
for
his
nobility
but
through
the
embarrassments
of
poverty
would
prefer
to
be
obscure
a
third
richly
endowed
with
both
laments
the
loneliness
of
an
unwedded
life
another
though
happily
married
is
doomed
to
childlessness
and
nurses
his
wealth
for
a
stranger
to
inherit
yet
another
blest
with
children
mournfully
bewails
the
misdeeds
of
son
or
daughter
wherefore
it
is
not
easy
for
anyone
to
be
at
perfect
peace
with
the
circumstances
of
his
lot
there
lurks
in
each
several
portion
something
which
they
who
experience
it
not
know
nothing
of
but
which
makes
the
sufferer
wince
besides
the
more
favoured
a
man
is
by
fortune
the
more
fastidiously
sensitive
is
he
and
unless
all
things
answer
to
his
whim
he
is
overwhelmed
by
the
most
trifling
misfortunes
because
utterly
unschooled
in
adversity
so
petty
are
the
trifles
which
rob
the
most
fortunate
of
perfect
happiness
how
many
are
there
dost
thou
imagine
who
would
think
themselves
nigh
heaven
if
but
a
small
portion
from
the
wreck
of
thy
fortune
should
fall
to
them
this
very
place
which
thou
callest
exile
is
to
them
that
dwell
therein
their
native
land
so
true
is
it
that
nothing
is
wretched
but
thinking
makes
it
so
and
conversely
every
lot
is
happy
if
borne
with
equanimity
who
is
so
blest
by
fortune
as
not
to
wish
to
change
his
state
if
once
he
gives
rein
to
a
rebellious
spirit
with
how
many
bitternesses
is
the
sweetness
of
human
felicity
blent
and
even
if
that
sweetness
seem
to
him
to
bring
delight
in
the
enjoying
yet
he
can
not
keep
it
from
departing
when
it
will
how
manifestly
wretched
then
is
the
bliss
of
earthly
fortune
which
lasts
not
for
ever
with
those
whose
temper
is
equable
and
can
give
no
perfect
satisfaction
to
the
then
ye
children
of
mortality
seek
ye
from
without
that
happiness
whose
seat
is
only
within
us
error
and
ignorance
bewilder
you
i
will
show
thee
in
brief
the
hinge
on
which
perfect
happiness
turns
is
there
anything
more
precious
to
thee
than
thyself
nothing
thou
wilt
say
if
then
thou
art
master
of
thyself
thou
wilt
possess
that
which
thou
wilt
never
be
willing
to
lose
and
which
fortune
can
not
take
from
thee
and
that
thou
mayst
see
that
happiness
can
not
possibly
consist
in
these
things
which
are
the
sport
of
chance
reflect
that
if
happiness
is
the
highest
good
of
a
creature
living
in
accordance
with
reason
and
if
a
thing
which
can
in
any
wise
be
reft
away
is
not
the
highest
good
since
that
which
can
not
be
taken
away
is
better
than
it
it
is
plain
that
fortune
can
not
aspire
to
bestow
happiness
by
reason
of
its
instability
and
besides
a
man
borne
along
by
this
transitory
felicity
must
either
know
or
not
know
its
unstability
if
he
knows
not
how
poor
is
a
happiness
which
depends
on
the
blindness
of
ignorance
if
he
knows
it
he
needs
must
fear
to
lose
a
happiness
whose
loss
he
believes
to
be
possible
wherefore
a
fear
suffers
him
not
to
be
happy
or
does
he
count
the
possibility
of
this
loss
a
trifling
matter
insignificant
then
must
be
the
good
whose
loss
can
be
borne
so
equably
and
further
i
know
thee
to
be
one
settled
in
the
belief
that
the
souls
of
men
certainly
die
not
with
them
and
convinced
thereof
by
numerous
proofs
it
is
clear
also
that
the
felicity
which
fortune
bestows
is
brought
to
an
end
with
the
death
of
the
body
therefore
it
can
not
be
doubted
but
that
if
happiness
is
conferred
in
this
way
the
whole
human
race
sinks
into
misery
when
death
brings
the
close
of
all
but
if
we
know
that
many
have
sought
the
joy
of
happiness
not
through
death
only
but
also
through
pain
and
suffering
how
can
life
make
men
happy
by
its
presence
when
it
makes
them
not
wretched
by
its
loss

or
in
their
own
what
are
they
but
mere
gold
and
heaps
of
money
yet
these
fine
things
show
their
quality
better
in
the
spending
than
in
the
hoarding
for
i
suppose
is
plain
that
greed
alva
makes
men
hateful
while
liberality
brings
fame
but
that
which
is
transferred
to
another
can
not
remain
in
one
own
possession
and
if
that
be
so
then
money
is
only
precious
when
it
is
given
away
and
by
being
transferred
to
others
ceases
to
be
one
own
again
if
all
the
money
in
the
world
were
heaped
up
in
one
man
possession
all
others
would
be
made
poor
sound
fills
the
ears
of
many
at
the
same
time
without
being
broken
into
parts
but
your
riches
can
not
pass
to
many
without
being
lessened
in
the
process
and
when
this
happens
they
must
needs
impoverish
those
whom
they
leave
how
poor
and
cramped
a
thing
then
is
riches
which
more
than
one
can
not
possess
as
an
unbroken
whole
which
falls
not
to
any
one
man
lot
without
the
impoverishment
of
everyone
else
or
is
it
the
glitter
of
gems
that
allures
the
eye
yet
how
rarely
excellent
soever
may
be
their
splendour
remember
the
flashing
light
is
in
the
jewels
not
in
the
man
indeed
i
greatly
marvel
at
men
admiration
of
them
for
what
can
rightly
seem
beautiful
to
a
being
endowed
with
life
and
reason
if
it
lack
the
movement
and
structure
of
life
and
although
such
things
do
in
the
end
take
on
them
more
beauty
from
their
maker
care
and
their
own
brilliancy
still
they
in
no
wise
merit
your
admiration
since
their
excellence
is
set
at
a
lower
grade
than
your
own
the
beauty
of
the
fields
delight
you
surely
yes
it
is
a
beautiful
part
of
a
right
beautiful
whole
fitly
indeed
do
we
at
times
enjoy
the
serene
calm
of
the
sea
admire
the
sky
the
stars
the
moon
the
sun
yet
is
any
of
these
thy
concern
dost
thou
venture
to
boast
thyself
of
the
beauty
of
any
one
of
them
art
decked
with
spring
flowers
is
it
fertility
that
swelleth
in
the
fruits
of
autumn
why
art
thou
moved
with
empty
transports
why
embracest
thou
an
alien
excellence
as
thine
own
never
will
fortune
make
thine
that
which
the
nature
of
things
has
excluded
from
thy
ownership
doubtless
the
fruits
of
the
earth
are
given
for
the
sustenance
of
living
creatures
but
if
thou
art
content
to
supply
thy
wants
so
far
as
suffices
nature
there
is
no
need
to
resort
to
fortune
bounty
nature
is
content
with
few
things
and
with
a
very
little
of
these
if
thou
art
minded
to
force
superfluities
upon
her
when
she
is
satisfied
that
which
thou
addest
will
prove
either
unpleasant
or
harmful
but
now
thou
thinkest
it
fine
to
shine
in
raiment
of
divers
colours
yet
if
indeed
there
is
any
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
such
things
it
is
the
texture
or
the
artist
skill
which
i
shall
admire
perhaps
it
is
a
long
train
of
servants
that
makes
thee
happy
why
if
they
behave
viciously
they
are
a
ruinous
burden
to
thy
house
and
exceeding
dangerous
to
their
own
master
while
if
they
are
honest
how
canst
thou
count
other
men
virtue
in
the
sum
of
thy
possessions
from
all
which
is
plainly
proved
that
not
one
of
these
things
which
thou
reckonest
in
the
number
of
thy
possessions
is
really
thine
and
if
there
is
in
them
no
beauty
to
be
desired
why
shouldst
thou
either
grieve
for
their
loss
or
find
joy
in
their
continued
possession
while
if
they
are
beautiful
in
their
own
nature
what
is
that
to
thee
they
would
have
been
not
less
pleasing
in
themselves
though
never
included
among
thy
possessions
for
they
derive
not
their
preciousness
from
being
counted
in
thy
riches
but
rather
thou
hast
chosen
to
count
them
in
thy
riches
because
they
seemed
to
thee
precious
what
seek
ye
by
all
this
noisy
outcry
about
fortune
to
chase
away
poverty
i
ween
by
means
of
abundance
and
yet
ye
find
the
result
just
contrary
why
this
varied
array
of
precious
furniture
needs
more
accessories
for
its
protection
it
is
a
true
saying
that
they
want
most
who
possess
most
and
conversely
they
want
very
little
who
measure
their
abundance
by
nature
requirements
not
by
the
superfluity
of
vain
display
have
ye
no
good
of
your
own
implanted
within
you
that
ye
seek
your
good
in
things
external
and
separate
is
the
nature
of
things
so
reversed
that
a
creature
divine
by
right
of
reason
can
in
no
other
way
be
splendid
in
his
own
eyes
save
by
the
possession
of
lifeless
chattels
yet
while
other
things
are
content
with
their
own
ye
who
in
your
intellect
are
seek
from
the
lowest
of
things
adornment
for
a
nature
of
supreme
excellence
and
perceive
not
how
great
a
wrong
ye
do
your
maker
his
will
was
that
mankind
should
excel
all
things
on
earth
ye
thrust
down
your
worth
beneath
the
lowest
of
things
for
if
that
in
which
each
thing
finds
its
good
is
plainly
more
precious
than
that
whose
good
it
is
by
your
own
estimation
ye
put
yourselves
below
the
vilest
of
things
when
ye
deem
these
vile
things
to
be
your
good
nor
does
this
fall
out
undeservedly
indeed
man
is
so
constituted
that
he
then
only
excels
other
things
when
he
knows
himself
but
he
is
brought
lower
than
the
beasts
if
he
lose
this
for
that
other
creatures
should
be
ignorant
of
themselves
is
natural
in
man
it
shows
as
a
defect
how
extravagant
then
is
this
error
of
yours
in
thinking
that
anything
can
be
embellished
by
adornments
not
its
own
it
can
not
be
for
if
such
accessories
add
any
lustre
it
is
the
accessories
that
get
the
praise
while
that
which
they
veil
and
cover
remains
in
its
pristine
ugliness
and
again
i
say
that
is
no
which
injures
its
possessor
is
this
untrue
no
quite
true
thou
sayest
and
yet
riches
have
often
hurt
those
that
possessed
them
since
the
worst
of
men
who
are
all
the
more
covetous
by
reason
of
their
wickedness
think
none
but
themselves
worthy
to
possess
all
the
gold
and
gems
the
world
contains
so
thou
who
now
dreadest
pike
and
sword
mightest
have
trolled
a
carol
in
the
robber
face
hadst
thou
entered
the
road
of
life
with
empty
pockets
oh
wondrous
blessedness
of
perishable
wealth
whose
acquisition
robs
thee
of
security
song
the
former
age
too
blest
the
former
age
their
life
who
in
the
fields
contented
led
and
still
by
luxury
unspoiled
on
frugal
acorns
sparely
fed
no
skill
was
theirs
the
luscious
grape
with
honey
sweetness
to
confuse
nor
china
soft
and
sheeny
silks
t
empurple
with
brave
tyrian
hues
the
grass
their
wholesome
couch
their
drink
the
stream
their
roof
the
pine
tall
shade
not
theirs
to
cleave
the
deep
nor
seek
in
strange
far
lands
the
spoils
of
trade
the
trump
of
war
was
heard
not
yet
nor
soiled
the
fields
by
bloodshed
stain
for
why
should
war
fierce
madness
arm
when
strife
brought
wound
but
brought
not
gain
ah
would
our
hearts
might
still
return
to
following
in
those
ancient
ways
alas
the
greed
of
getting
glows
more
fierce
than
etna
fiery
blaze
woe
woe
for
him
it
was
who
first
gold
hidden
store
revealed
and
perilous
dug
out
the
gems
that
fain
would
be
concealed
vi
now
shall
i
say
of
rank
and
power
whereby
because
ye
know
not
true
power
and
dignity
ye
hope
to
reach
the
sky
yet
when
rank
and
power
have
fallen
to
the
worst
of
men
did
ever
an
etna
belching
forth
flame
and
fiery
deluge
work
such
mischief
verily
as
i
think
thou
dost
remember
how
thine
ancestors
sought
to
abolish
the
consular
power
which
had
been
the
foundation
of
their
liberties
on
account
of
the
overweening
pride
of
the
consuls
and
how
for
that
pride
they
had
already
abolished
the
kingly
title
and
if
as
happens
but
rarely
these
prerogatives
are
conferred
on
virtuous
men
it
is
only
the
virtue
of
those
who
exercise
them
that
pleases
so
it
appears
that
honour
cometh
not
to
virtue
from
rank
but
to
rank
from
virtue
look
too
at
the
nature
of
that
power
which
ye
find
so
attractive
and
glorious
do
ye
never
consider
ye
creatures
of
earth
what
ye
are
and
over
whom
ye
exercise
your
fancied
lordship
suppose
now
that
in
the
mouse
tribe
there
should
rise
up
one
claiming
rights
and
powers
for
himself
above
the
rest
would
ye
not
laugh
consumedly
yet
if
thou
lookest
to
his
body
alone
what
creature
canst
thou
find
more
feeble
than
man
who
oftentimes
is
killed
by
the
bite
of
a
fly
or
by
some
insect
creeping
into
the
inner
passage
of
his
system
yet
what
rights
can
one
exercise
over
another
save
only
as
regards
the
body
and
that
which
is
lower
than
the
body
i
mean
fortune
what
wilt
thou
bind
with
thy
mandates
the
free
spirit
canst
thou
force
from
its
due
tranquillity
the
mind
that
is
firmly
composed
by
reason
a
tyrant
thought
to
drive
a
man
of
free
birth
to
reveal
his
accomplices
in
a
conspiracy
but
the
prisoner
bit
off
his
tongue
and
threw
it
into
the
furious
tyrant
face
thus
the
tortures
which
the
tyrant
thought
the
instrument
of
his
cruelty
the
sage
made
an
opportunity
for
heroism
moreover
what
is
there
that
one
man
can
do
to
another
which
he
himself
may
not
have
to
undergo
in
his
turn
we
are
told
that
busiris
who
used
to
kill
his
guests
was
himself
slain
by
his
guest
hercules
regulus
had
thrown
into
bonds
many
of
the
carthaginians
whom
he
had
taken
in
war
soon
after
he
himself
submitted
his
hands
to
the
chains
of
the
vanquished
then
thinkest
thou
that
man
hath
any
power
who
can
not
prevent
another
being
able
to
do
to
him
what
he
himself
can
do
to
others
if
there
were
any
element
of
natural
and
proper
good
in
rank
and
power
they
would
never
come
to
the
utterly
bad
since
opposites
are
not
wont
to
be
associated
nature
brooks
not
the
union
of
contraries
so
seeing
there
is
no
doubt
that
wicked
wretches
are
oftentimes
set
in
high
places
it
is
also
clear
that
things
which
suffer
association
with
the
worst
of
men
can
not
be
good
in
their
own
nature
indeed
this
judgment
may
with
some
reason
be
passed
concerning
all
the
gifts
of
fortune
which
fall
so
plentifully
to
all
the
most
wicked
this
ought
also
to
be
considered
here
i
think
no
one
doubts
a
man
to
be
brave
in
whom
he
has
observed
a
brave
spirit
residing
it
is
plain
that
one
who
is
endowed
with
speed
is
so
also
music
makes
men
musical
the
healing
art
physicians
rhetoric
public
speakers
for
each
of
these
has
naturally
its
own
proper
working
there
is
no
confusion
with
the
effects
of
contrary
things
nay
even
of
itself
it
rejects
what
is
incompatible
and
yet
wealth
can
not
extinguish
insatiable
greed
nor
has
power
ever
made
him
master
of
himself
whom
vicious
lusts
kept
bound
in
indissoluble
fetters
dignity
conferred
on
the
wicked
not
only
fails
to
make
them
worthy
but
contrarily
reveals
and
displays
their
unworthiness
why
does
it
so
happen
because
ye
take
pleasure
in
calling
by
false
names
things
whose
nature
is
quite
incongruous
thereto
by
names
which
are
easily
proved
false
by
the
very
effects
of
the
things
themselves
even
so
it
is
these
riches
that
power
this
dignity
are
none
of
them
rightly
so
called
finally
we
may
draw
the
same
conclusion
concerning
the
whole
sphere
of
fortune
within
which
there
is
plainly
nothing
to
be
truly
desired
nothing
of
intrinsic
excellence
for
she
neither
always
joins
herself
to
the
good
nor
does
she
make
good
men
of
those
to
whom
she
is
united
song
vi
nero
infamy
we
know
what
mischief
dire
he
wrought
rome
fired
the
fathers
slain
whose
hand
with
brother
slaughter
wet
a
mother
blood
did
stain
no
pitying
tear
his
cheek
bedewed
as
on
the
corse
he
gazed
that
mother
beauty
once
so
fair
a
critic
voice
appraised
yet
far
and
wide
from
east
to
west
his
sway
the
nations
own
and
scorching
south
and
icy
north
obey
his
will
alone
did
then
high
power
a
curb
impose
on
nero
phrenzied
will
ah
woe
when
to
the
evil
heart
is
joined
the
sword
to
kill
vii
then
said
i
knowest
thyself
that
ambition
for
worldly
success
hath
but
little
swayed
me
yet
i
have
desired
opportunity
for
action
lest
virtue
in
default
of
exercise
should
languish
away
then
she
is
that
last
infirmity
which
is
able
to
allure
minds
which
though
of
noble
quality
have
not
yet
been
moulded
to
any
exquisite
refinement
by
the
perfecting
of
the
virtues
i
mean
the
love
of
glory
and
fame
for
high
services
rendered
to
the
commonweal
and
yet
consider
with
me
how
poor
and
unsubstantial
a
thing
this
glory
is
the
whole
of
this
earth
globe
as
thou
hast
learnt
from
the
demonstration
of
astronomy
compared
with
the
expanse
of
heaven
is
found
no
bigger
than
a
point
that
is
to
say
if
measured
by
the
vastness
of
sphere
it
is
held
to
occupy
absolutely
no
space
at
all
now
of
this
so
insignificant
portion
of
the
universe
it
is
about
a
fourth
part
as
ptolemy
proofs
have
taught
us
which
is
inhabited
by
living
creatures
known
to
us
if
from
this
fourth
part
you
take
away
in
thought
all
that
is
usurped
by
seas
and
marshes
or
lies
a
vast
waste
of
waterless
desert
barely
is
an
exceeding
narrow
area
left
for
human
habitation
you
then
who
are
shut
in
and
prisoned
in
this
merest
fraction
of
a
point
space
do
ye
take
thought
for
the
blazoning
of
your
fame
for
the
spreading
abroad
of
your
renown
why
what
amplitude
or
magnificence
has
glory
when
confined
to
such
narrow
and
petty
limits
the
straitened
bounds
of
this
scant
are
inhabited
by
many
nations
differing
widely
in
speech
in
usages
in
mode
of
life
to
many
of
these
from
the
difficulty
of
travel
from
diversities
of
speech
from
want
of
commercial
intercourse
the
fame
not
only
of
individual
men
but
even
of
cities
is
unable
to
reach
why
in
cicero
days
as
he
himself
somewhere
points
out
the
fame
of
the
roman
republic
had
not
yet
crossed
the
caucasus
and
yet
by
that
time
her
name
had
grown
formidable
to
the
parthians
and
other
nations
of
those
parts
seest
thou
then
how
narrow
how
confined
is
the
glory
ye
take
pains
to
spread
abroad
and
extend
can
the
fame
of
a
single
roman
penetrate
where
the
glory
of
the
roman
name
fails
to
pass
moreover
the
customs
and
institutions
of
different
races
agree
not
together
so
that
what
is
deemed
praise
worthy
in
one
country
is
thought
punishable
in
another
wherefore
if
any
love
the
applause
of
fame
it
shall
not
profit
him
to
publish
his
name
among
many
peoples
then
each
must
be
content
to
have
the
range
of
his
glory
limited
to
his
own
people
the
splendid
immortality
of
fame
must
be
confined
within
the
bounds
of
a
single
race
more
how
many
of
high
renown
in
their
own
times
have
been
lost
in
oblivion
for
want
of
a
record
indeed
of
what
avail
are
written
records
even
which
with
their
authors
are
overtaken
by
the
dimness
of
age
after
a
somewhat
longer
time
but
ye
when
ye
think
on
future
fame
fancy
it
an
immortality
that
ye
are
begetting
for
yourselves
why
if
thou
scannest
the
infinite
spaces
of
eternity
what
room
hast
thou
left
for
rejoicing
in
the
durability
of
thy
name
verily
if
a
single
moment
space
be
compared
with
ten
thousand
years
it
has
a
certain
relative
duration
however
little
since
each
period
is
definite
but
this
same
number
of
years
ay
and
a
number
many
times
as
great
can
not

if

not

nothing

as
for

ye

the

and
win
the
empty
applause
of

ye
abandon
the
superlative
worth
of
conscience

virtue

ask
a
recompense
from
the
poor
words
of
others
let
me
tell
thee
how
wittily
one
did
mock
the
shallowness
of
this
sort
of
arrogance
a
certain
man
assailed
one
who
had
put
on
the
name
of
philosopher
as
a
cloak
to
pride
and
not
for
the
practice
of
real
virtue
and
added
now
shall
i
know
if
thou
art
a
philosopher
if
thou
bearest
reproaches
calmly
and
patiently
the
other
for
awhile
affected
to
be
patient
and
having
endured
to
be
abused
cried
out
derisively
do
you
see
that
i
am
a
philosopher
the
other
with
biting
sarcasm
retorted
i
should
have
hadst
thou
held
thy
peace
moreover
what
concern
have
choice
spirits
for
it
is
of
such
men
we
speak
men
who
seek
glory
by
virtue
what
concern
i
say
have
these

fame
after
the
dissolution
of
the

if
men
die
wholly
which
our
reasonings
forbid
us
to
believe
there
is
no
such
thing
as
glory
at
all
since
he
to
whom
the
glory
is
said
to
belong
is
altogether
but
if
the
mind
conscious
of
its
own
rectitude
is
released
from
its
earthly
prison
and
seeks
heaven
in
free
flight
doth
it
not
despise
all
earthly
things

it
rejoices
in
its
deliverance
from

is

inconstancy

the

the
one
enchains
the
minds
of
those
who
enjoy

favour
by
the
semblance

good
the

delivers
them

thou
mayst
see

fickle
shifting
as

the

good
fortune
by
her
allurements
draws
men
far

the

ill
fortune
ofttimes
draws
men

good

it

is

manner
therefore
the

man
partakes
also
of
the

all
other
ends
are
relative
to
this

since
they
are
all
pursued
only
for
the

it

which
is
the
sole

she
ceased
but
i
stood
fixed
by
the
sweetness
of
the
song
in
wonderment
and
eager
expectation
my
ears
still
strained
to
listen
and
then
after
a
little
i
said
sovereign

of
the
stricken
soul
what
refreshment
hast
thou
brought
me
no
less
by
the
sweetness
of
thy

by
the
weightiness
of
thy
discourse

i
think
not
that
i
shall
hereafter
be
unequal
to
the
blows
of
fortune
wherefore
i
no
longer
dread
the
remedies
which
thou
saidst
were
something
too
severe
for
my
strength
nay
rather
i
am
eager
to
hear
of
them
and
call
for
them
with
all
vehemence
then
said
she
marked
thee
fastening
upon
my
words
silently
and
intently
and
i
expected
or
to
speak
more
truly
i
myself
brought
about
in
thee
this
state
of
mind
what
now
remains
is
of
such
sort
that
to
the
taste
indeed
it
is
biting
but
when
received
within
it
turns
to
sweetness
but
whereas
thou
dost
profess
thyself
desirous
of
hearing
with
what
ardour
wouldst
thou
not
burn
didst
thou
but
perceive
whither
it
is
my
task

thee

mayst

for
a
little
space
she
remained
in
a
fixed
gaze
withdrawn
as
it
were
into
the
august
chamber
of
her
mind
then
she
thus
began
mortal
creatures
in
those
anxious
aims
which
find
employment
in
so
many
varied
pursuits
though
they
take
many
paths
yet
strive
to
reach
one
goal
the
goal
of
happiness
now
is
that
which
when
a
man
hath
got
he
can
lack
nothing
further
this
it
is
which
is
the
supreme
good
of
all
containing
within
itself
all
particular
good
so
that
if
anything
is
still
wanting
thereto
this
can
not
be
the
supreme
good
since
something
would
be
left
outside
which
might
be
desired
is
clear
then
that
happiness
is
a
state
perfected
by
the
assembling
together
of
all
good
things
to
this
state
as
we
have
said
all
men
try
to
attain
but
by
different
paths
for
the
desire
of
the
true
good
is
naturally
implanted
in
the
minds
of
men
only
error
leads
them
aside
out
of
the
way
in
pursuit
of
the
false
some
deeming
it
the
highest
good
to
want
for
nothing
spare
no
pains
to
attain
affluence
others
judging
the
good
to
be
that
to
which
respect
is
most
worthily
paid
strive
to
win
the
reverence
of
their
by
the
attainment
of
official
dignity
some
there
are
who
fix
the
chief
good
in
supreme
power
these
either
wish
themselves
to
enjoy
sovereignty
or
try
to
attach
themselves
to
those
who
have
it
those
again
who
think
renown
to
be
something
of
supreme
excellence
are
in
haste
to
spread
abroad
the
glory
of
their
name
either
through
the
arts
of
war
or
of
peace
a
great
many
measure
the
attainment
of
good
by
joy
and
gladness
of
heart
these
think
it
the
height
of
happiness
to
give
themselves
over
to
pleasure
others
there
are
again
who
interchange
the
ends
and
means
one
with
the
other
in
their
aims
for
instance
some
want
riches
for
the
sake
of
pleasure
and
power
some
covet
power
either
for
the
sake
of
money
or
in
order
to
bring
renown
to
their
name
so
it
is
on
these
ends
then
that
the
aim
of
human
acts
and
wishes
is
centred
and
on
others
like
to
these
for
instance
noble
birth
and
popularity
which
seem
to
compass
a
certain
renown
wife
and
children
which
are
sought
for
the
sweetness
of
their
possession
while
as
for
friendship
the
most
sacred
kind
indeed
is
counted
in
the
category
of
virtue
not
of
fortune
but
other
kinds
are
entered
upon
for
the
sake
of
power
or
of
enjoyment
and
as
for
bodily
excellences
it
is
obvious
that
they
are
to
be
ranged
with
the
above
for
strength
and
stature
surely
manifest
power
beauty
and
fleetness
of
foot
bring
celebrity
health
brings
pleasure
it
is
plain
then
that
the
only
object
sought
for
in
all
these
ways
is
for
that
which
each
seeks
in
preference
to
all
else
that
is
in
his
judgment
the
supreme
good
and
we
have
defined
the
supreme
good
to
be
happiness
therefore
that
state
which
each
wishes
in
preference
to
all
others
is
in
his
judgment
happy
hast
then
set
before
thine
eyes
something
like
a
scheme
of
human
happiness
wealth
rank
power
glory
pleasure
now
epicurus
from
a
sole
regard
to
these
considerations
with
some
consistency
concluded
the
highest
good
to
be
pleasure
because
all
the
other
objects
seem
to
bring
some
delight
to
the
soul
but
to
return
to
human
pursuits
and
aims
man
mind
seeks
to
recover
its
proper
good
in
spite
of
the
mistiness
of
its
recollection
but
like
a
drunken
man
knows
not
by
what
path
to
return
home
think
you
they
are
wrong
who
strive
to
escape
want
nay
truly
there
is
nothing
which
can
so
well
complete
happiness
as
a
state
abounding
in
all
good
things
needing
nothing
from
outside
but
wholly
do
they
fall
into
error
who
deem
that
which
is
best
to
be
also
best
deserving
to
receive
the
homage
of
reverence
not
at
all
that
can
not
possibly
be
vile
and
contemptible
to
attain
which
the
endeavours
of
nearly
all
mankind
are
directed
then
is
power
not
to
be
reckoned
in
the
category
of
good
why
can
that
which
is
plainly
more
efficacious
than
anything
else
be
esteemed
a
thing
feeble
and
void
of
strength
or
is
renown
to
be
thought
of
no
account
nay
it
can
not
be
ignored
that
the
highest
renown
is
constantly
associated
with
the
highest
excellence
and
what
need
is
there
to
say
that
happiness
is
not
haunted
by
care
and
gloom
nor
exposed
to
trouble
and
vexation
since
that
is
a
condition
we
ask
of
the
very
least
of
things
from
the
possession
and
enjoyment
of
which
we
expect
delight
so
then
these
are
the
blessings
men
wish
to
win
they
want
riches
rank
sovereignty
glory
pleasure
because
they
believe
that
by
these
means
they
will
secure
independence
reverence
power
renown
and
joy
of
heart
therefore
it
is
which
men
seek
by
such
divers
courses
and
herein
is
easily
shown
the
might
of
nature
power
since
although
opinions
are
so
various
and
discordant
yet
they
agree
in
cherishing
as
the

the

of

how
the

of

all
the

ways
how

of
the

i
in

rehearse
lo

he
dread

once
the
taste

his
cruel
lips
once
more
straight
his
slumbering
fierceness
wakes
with
one
roar
his
bonds
he
breaks
and
first
wreaks
his
vengeful
force
on
his
trainer
mangled
corse
and
the
woodland
songster
pent
in
forlorn
imprisonment

spy
the

afar

with
sheltering
foliage
all
these
dainties
he
will
spurn
to
the
woods
his
heart
will
turn
only
for
the
woods
he
longs
pipes
the
woods
in
all
his
songs
to
rude
force

thus
are
all
things
seen
to
yearn
in
due
time
for
due
return
and
no
order
fixed
may
stay
save
which
in
th
appointed
way
joins
the
end
to
the
beginning
in
a
steady
cycle
spinning
iii
too
creatures
of
earth
have
some
glimmering
of
your
origin
however
faint
and
though
in
a
vision
dim
and
clouded
yet
in
some
wise
notwithstanding
ye
discern
the
true
end
of
happiness
and
so
the
aim
of
nature
leads
you
thither
to
that
true
good
while
error
in
many
forms
leads
you
astray
therefrom
for
reflect
whether
men
are
able
to
win
happiness
by
those
means
through
which
they
think
to
reach
the
proposed
end
truly
if
either
wealth
rank
or
any
of
the
rest
bring
with
them
anything
of
such
sort
as
seems
to
have
nothing
wanting
to
it
that
is
good
we
too
acknowledge
that
some
are
made
happy
by
the
acquisition
of
these
things
but
if
they
are
not
able
to
fulfil
their
promises
and
moreover
lack
many
good
things
is
not
the
happiness
men
seek
in
them
clearly
discovered
to
be
a
false
show
therefore
do
i
first
ask
thee
thyself
who
but
lately
wert
living
in
affluence
amid
all
that
abundance
of
wealth
was
thy
mind
never
troubled
in
consequence
of
some
wrong
done
to
thee
said
i
can
not
ever
remember
a
time
when
my
mind
was
so
completely
at
peace
as
not
to
feel
the
pang
of
some
uneasiness
it
not
because
either
something
was
absent
which
thou
wouldst
not
have
absent
or
present
which
thou
wouldst
have
away
said
i
thou
didst
want
the
presence
of
the
one
the
absence
of
the
other
a
man
lacks
that
of
which
he
is
in
want
does
he
who
lacks
something
is
not
in
all
points
certainly
not
said
i
wert
thou
then
in
the
plenitude
of
thy
wealth
supporting
this
insufficiency
must
have
been
then
can
not
make
its
possessor
independent
and
free
from
all
want
yet
this
was
what
it
seemed
to
promise
moreover
i
think
this
also
well
deserves
to
be
considered
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
special
nature
of
money
to
hinder
its
being
taken
away
from
those
who
possess
it
against
their
will
admit
it
of
course
when
every
day
the
stronger
wrests
it
from
the
weaker
without
his
consent
else
whence
come
lawsuits
except
in
seeking
to
recover
moneys
which
have
been
taken
away
against
their
owner
will
by
force
or
fraud
said
i
everyone
will
need
some
extraneous
means
of
protection
to
keep
his
money
safe
can
venture
to
deny
it
he
would
not
unless
he
possessed
the
money
which
it
is
possible
to
lose
he
certainly
would
not
we
have
worked
round
to
an
opposite
conclusion
the
wealth
which
was
thought
to
make
a
man
independent
rather
puts
him
in
need
of
further
protection
how
in
the
world
then
can
want
be
driven
away
by
riches
can
not
the
rich
feel
hunger
can
not
they
thirst
are
not
the
limbs
of
the
wealthy
sensitive
to
the
winter
cold
but
thou
wilt
say
the
rich
have
the
wherewithal
to
sate
their
hunger
the
means
to
get
rid
of
thirst
and
cold
true
enough
want
can
thus
be
soothed
by
riches
wholly
removed
it
can
not
be
for
if
this
want
is
glutted
by
wealth
it
needs
must
be
that
the
want
itself
which
can
be
so
glutted
still
remains
i
do
not
speak
of
how
very
little
suffices
for
nature
and
how
for
avarice
nothing
is
enough
wherefore
if
wealth
can
not
get
rid
of
want
and
makes
new
wants
of
its
own
how
can
ye
believe
that
it
bestows
independence
song
iii
the
insatiableness
of
avarice
though
the
covetous
grown
wealthy
see
his
piles
of

rise
high
though
he
gather
store
of
treasure
that
can
never

his
eyes
are
closed
in

iv
but
official
dignity
clothes
him
to
whom
it
comes
with
honour
and
reverence
have
then
offices
of
state
such
power
as
to
plant
virtue
in
the
minds
of
their
possessors
and
drive
out
vice
nay
they
are
rather
wont
to
signalize
iniquity
than
to
chase
it
away
and
hence
arises
our
indignation
that
honours
so
often
fall
to
the
most
iniquitous
of
men
accordingly
catullus
calls
nonius
an
though
sitting
in
the
curule
chair
dost
not
see
what
infamy
high
position
brings
upon
the
bad
surely
their
unworthiness
will
be
less
conspicuous
if
their
rank
does
not
draw
upon
them
the
public
notice
in
thy
own
case
wouldst
thou
ever
have
been
induced
by
all
these
perils
to
think
of
sharing
office
with
decoratus
since
thou
hast
discerned
in
him
the
spirit
of
a
rascally
parasite
and
informer
no
we
can
not
deem
men
worthy
of
reverence
on
account
of
their
office
whom
we
deem
unworthy
of
the
office
itself
but
didst
thou
see
a
man
endued
with
wisdom
couldst
thou
suppose
him
not
worthy
of
reverence
nor
of
that
wisdom
with
which
he
was
endued
certainly
not
is
in
virtue
a
dignity
of
her
own
which
she
forthwith
passes
over
to
those
to
whom
she
is
united
and
since
public
honours
can
not
do
this
it
is
clear
that
they
do
not
possess
the
true
beauty
of
dignity
and
here
this
well
deserves
to
be
noticed
that
if
a
man
is
the
more
scorned
in
proportion
as
he
is
despised
by
a
greater
number
high
position
not
only
fails
to
win
reverence
for
the
wicked
but
even
loads
them
the
more
with
contempt
by
drawing
more
attention
to
them
but
not
without
retribution
for
the
wicked
pay
back
a
return
in
kind
to
the
dignities
they
put
on
by
the
pollution
of
their
touch
perhaps
too
another
consideration
may
teach
thee
to
confess
that
true
reverence
can
not
come
through
these
counterfeit
dignities
it
is
this
if
one
who
had
been
many
times
consul
chanced
to
visit
barbaric
lands
would
his
office
win
him
the
reverence
of
the
barbarians
and
yet
if
reverence
were
the
natural
effect
of
dignities
they
would
not
forego
their
proper
function
in
any
part
of
the
world
even
as
fire
never
anywhere
fails
to
give
forth
heat
but
since
this
effect
is
not
due
to
their
own
efficacy
but
is
attached
to
them
by
the
mistaken
opinion
of
mankind
they
disappear
straightway
when
they
are
set
before
those
who
do
not
esteem
them
dignities
thus
the
case
stands
with
foreign
peoples
but
does
their
repute
last
for
ever
even
in
the
land
of
their
origin
why
the
prefecture
which
was
once
a
great
power
is
now
an
empty
name
a
burden
merely
on
the
senator
fortune
the
commissioner
of
the
public
corn
supply
was
once
a
personage
now
what
is
more
contemptible
than
this
office
for
as
we
said
just
now
that
which
hath
no
true
comeliness
of
its
own
now
receives
now
loses
lustre
at
the
caprice
of
those
who
have
to
do
with
it
so
then
if
dignities
can
not
win
men
reverence
if
they
are
actually
sullied
by
the
contamination
of
the
wicked
if
they
lose
their
splendour
through
time
changes
if
they
come
into
contempt
merely
for
lack
of
public
estimation
what
precious
beauty
have
they
in
themselves
much
less
to
give
to
others
song
iv
disgrace
of
honours
conferred
by
a
tyrant
though
royal
purple
soothes
his
pride
and
snowy
pearls
his
neck
adorn
nero
in
all
his
riot
lives
the
mark
of
universal
scorn
yet
he
on
reverend
heads
conferred
th
inglorious
honours
of
the
state
shall
we
then
deem
them
truly
blessed
whom
such
preferment
hath
made
great
then
does
sovereignty
and
the
intimacy
of
kings
prove
able
to
confer
power
why
surely
does
not
the
happiness
of
kings
endure
for
ever
and
yet
antiquity
is
full
of
examples
and
these
days
also
of
kings
whose
happiness
has
turned
into
calamity
how
glorious
a
power
which
is
not
even
found
effectual
for
its
own
preservation
but
if
happiness
has
its
source
in
sovereign
power
is
not
happiness
diminished
and
misery
inflicted
in
its
stead
in
so
far
as
that
power
falls
short
of
completeness
yet
however
widely
human
sovereignty
be
extended
there
must
still
be
more
peoples
left
over
whom
each
several
king
holds
no
sway
now
at
whatever
point
the
power
on
which
happiness
depends
ceases
here
powerlessness
steals
in
and
makes
wretchedness
so
by
this
way
of
reckoning
there
must
needs
be
a
balance
of
wretchedness
in
the
lot
of
the
king
the
tyrant

had
made
trial
of
the
perils
of
his
condition

that
he
found
in
his
sons
his
tormentors
and
how
galling
such
a
contingency
would
be
i
must
needs
put
thee
in
mind
since
thou
hast
never
in
any
wise
suffered
such
experiences
nor
art
thou
now
under
any
uneasiness
in
such
a
case
i
agree
with
my
servant
euripides
who
said
that
a
man
without
children
was
fortunate
in
his
misfortune
h
footnotes
h
paley
translates
the
lines
in
euripides
the
childless
are
indeed
spared
from
much
pain
and
sorrow
but
their
supposed
happiness
is
after
all
but
wretchedness
euripides
meaning
is
therefore
really
just
the
reverse
of
that
which
boethius
makes
it
see
euripides

pleasure
sting
this
is
the
way
of
pleasure
she
stings
them
that
despoil
her
and
like
the
wingéd
toiler
who
lost
her
honeyed
treasure
she
flies
but
leaves
her
smart
in
the
heart
viii
is
beyond
doubt
then
that
these
paths
do
not
lead
to
happiness
they
can
not
guide
anyone
to
the
promised
goal
now
i
will
very
briefly
show
what
serious
evils
are
involved
in
following
them
just
consider
is
it
thy
endeavour
to
heap
up
money
why
thou
must
wrest
it
from
its
present
possessor
art
thou
minded
to
put
on
the
splendour
of
official
dignity
thou
must
beg
from
those
who
have
the
giving
of
it
thou
who
covetest
to
outvie
others
in
honour
must
lower
thyself
to
the
humble
posture
of
petition
dost
thou
long
for
power
thou
must
face
perils
for
thou
wilt
be
at
the
mercy
of
thy
subjects
plots
is
glory
thy
aim
thou
art
lured
on
through
all
manner
of
hardships
and
there
is
an
end
to
thy
peace
of
mind
art
fain
to
lead
a
life
of
pleasure
yet
who
does
not
scorn
and
contemn
one
who
is
the
slave
of
the
weakest
and
vilest
of
things
the
body
again
on
how
slight
and
perishable
a
possession
do
they
rely
who
set
before
themselves
bodily
excellences
can
ye
ever
surpass
the
elephant
in
bulk
or
the
bull
in
strength
can
ye
excel
the
tiger
in
swiftness
look
upon
the
infinitude
the
solidity
the
swift
motion
of
the
heavens
and
for
once
cease
to
admire
things
mean
and
worthless
and
yet
the
heavens
are
not
so
much
to
be
admired
on
this
account
as
for
the
reason
which
guides
them
then
how
transient
is
the
lustre
of
beauty
how
soon
gone
more
fleeting
than
the
fading
bloom
of
spring
flowers
and
yet
if
as
aristotle
says
men
should
see
with
the
eyes
of
lynceus
so
that
their
sight
might
pierce
through
obstructions
would
not
that
body
of
alcibiades
so
gloriously
fair
in
outward
seeming
appear
altogether
loathsome
when
all
its
inward
parts
lay
open
to
the
view
therefore
it
is
not
thy
own
nature
that
makes
thee
seem
beautiful
but
the
weakness
of
the
eyes
that
see
thee
yet
prize
as
unduly
as
ye
will
that
body
excellences
so
long
as
ye
know
that
this
that
ye
admire
whatever
its
worth
can
be
dissolved
away
by
the
feeble
flame
of
a
three
days
fever
from
all
which
considerations
we
may
conclude
as
a
whole
that
these
things
which
can
not
make
good
the
advantages
they
promise
which
are
never
made
perfect
by
the
assemblage
of
all
good
things
these
neither
lead
as
to
happiness
nor
themselves
make
men
completely
happy

human
folly
alas
how
wide
astray
doth
ignorance
these
wretched
mortals
lead
from
truth
own
way
for
not
on
leafy
stems
do
ye
within
the
green
wood
look
for
gold
nor
strip
the
vine
for
gems
your
nets
ye
do
not
spread
upon
the
that
the
groaning
board
with
fish
be
furnishèd
if
ye
are
fain
to
chase
the
bounding
goat
ye
sweep
not
in
vain
search
the
ocean
ruffled
face
the
sea
far
depths
they
know
each
hidden
nook
wherein
the
waves
the
pearl
as
white
as
snow
where
lurks
the
tyrian
shell
where
fish
and
prickly
urchins
do
abound
all
this
they
know
full
well
but
not
to
know
or
care
where
hidden
lies
the
good
all
hearts
desire
this
blindness
they
can
bear
with
gaze
on
earth
they
seek
for
that
which
reacheth
far
beyond
the
starry
firmament
what
curse
shall
i
call
down
on
hearts
so
dull
may
they
the
race
still
run
for
wealth
and
high
renown
and
when
with
much
ado
the
false
good
they
have
grasped
ah
then
too
late
may
they
discern
the
true
ix
much
may
well
suffice
to
set
forth
the
form
of
false
happiness
if
this
is
now
clear
to
thine
eyes
the
next
step
is
to
show
what
true
happiness
is
said
i
see
clearly
enough
that
neither
is
independence
to
be
found
in
wealth
nor
power
in
sovereignty
nor
reverence
in
dignities
nor
fame
in
glory
nor
true
joy
in
pleasures
thou
discerned
also
the
causes
why
this
is
so
seem
to
have
some
inkling
but
i
should
like
to
learn
more
at
large
from
thee
truly
the
reason
is
hard
at
hand
which
is
simple
and
indivisible
by
nature
human
error
and
transforms
from
the
true
and
perfect
to
the
false
and
imperfect
dost
thou
imagine
that
which
lacketh
nothing
can
want
power
not
for
if
there
is
any
feebleness
of
strength
in
anything
in
this
there
must
necessarily
be
need
of
external
protection
is
so
the
nature
of
independence
and
power
is
one
and
the
same
seems
so
but
dost
think
that
anything
of
such
a
nature
as
this
can
be
looked
upon
with
contempt
or
is
it
rather
of
all
things
most
worthy
of
veneration
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
that
us
then
add
reverence
to
independence
and
power
and
conclude
these
three
to
be
one
must
if
we
will
acknowledge
the
truth
thou
then
this
combination
of
qualities
to
be
obscure
and
without
distinction
or
rather
famous
in
all
renown
just
consider
can
that
want
renown
which
has
been
agreed
to
be
lacking
in
nothing
to
be
supreme
in
power
and
right
worthy
of
honour
for
the
reason
that
it
can
not
bestow
this
upon
itself
and
so
comes
to
appear
somewhat
poor
in
esteem
can
not
but
acknowledge
that
being
what
it
is
this
union
of
qualities
is
also
right
famous
follows
then
that
we
must
admit
that
renown
is
not
different
from
the
other
three
does
said
i
then
which
needs
nothing
outside
itself
which
can
accomplish
all
things
in
its
own
strength
which
enjoys
fame
and
compels
reverence
must
not
this
evidently
be
also
fully
crowned
with
joy
sooth
i
can
not
conceive
said
i
any
sadness
can
find
entrance
into
such
a
state
wherefore
i
must
needs
acknowledge
it
full
of
joy
at
least
if
our
former
conclusions
are
to
hold
for
the
same
reasons
this
also
is
necessary
that
independence
power
renown
reverence
and
sweetness
of
delight
are
different
only
in
name
but
in
substance
differ
no
wise
one
from
the
other
is
said
i
then
which
is
one
and
simple
by
nature
human
perversity
separates
and
in
trying
to
win
a
part
of
that
which
has
no
parts
fails
to
attain
not
only
that
portion
since
there
are
no
portions
but
also
the
whole
to
which
it
does
not
dream
of
aspiring
so
said
i
who
to
escape
want
seeks
riches
gives
himself
no
concern
about
power
he
prefers
a
mean
and
low
estate
and
also
denies
himself
many
pleasures
dear
to
nature
to
avoid
losing
the
money
which
he
has
gained
but
at
this
rate
he
does
not
even
attain
to
independence
a
weakling
void
of
strength
vexed
by
distresses
mean
and
despised
and
buried
in
obscurity
he
again
who
thirsts
alone
for
power
squanders
his
wealth
despises
pleasure
and
thinks
fame
and
rank
alike
worthless
without
power
but
thou
seest
in
how
many
ways
his
state
also
is
defective
sometimes
it
happens
that
he
lacks
necessaries
that
he
is
gnawed
by
anxieties
and
since
he
can
not
rid
himself
of
these
inconveniences
even
ceases
to
have
that
power
which
was
his
whole
end
and
aim
in
like
manner
may
we
cast
up
the
reckoning
in
case
of
rank
of
glory
or
of
pleasure
for
since
each
one
of
these
severally
is
identical
with
the
rest
whosoever
seeks
any
one
of
them
without
the
others
does
not
even
lay
hold
of
that
one
which
he
makes
his
aim
said
i
then
anyone
desire
to
obtain
them
together
he
does
indeed
wish
for
happiness
as
a
whole
but
will
he
find
it
in
these
things
which
as
we
have
proved
are
unable
to
bestow
what
they
promise
by
no
means
said
i
happiness
must
certainly
not
be
sought
in
these
things
which
severally
are
believed
to
afford
some
one
of
the
blessings
most
to
be
desired
must
not
i
admit
no
conclusion
could
be
more
true
then
the
form
and
the
causes
of
false
happiness
are
set
before
thine
eyes
now
turn
thy
gaze
to
the
other
side
there
thou
wilt
straightway
see
the
true
happiness
i
promised
indeed
is
plain
to
the
blind
said
i
didst
point
it
out
even
now
in
seeking
to
unfold
the
causes
of
the
false
for
unless
i
am
mistaken
that
is
true
and
perfect
happiness
which
crowns
one
with
the
union
of
independence
power
reverence
renown
and
joy
and
to
prove
to
thee
with
how
deep
an
insight
i
have
listened
since
all
these
are
the
same
that
which
can
truly
bestow
one
of
them
i
know
to
be
without
doubt
full
and
complete
happiness
art
thou
my
scholar
in
this
thy
conviction
only
one
thing
shouldst
thou
add
is
that
said
i
there
aught
thinkest
thou
amid
these
mortal
and
perishable
things
which
can
produce
a
state
such
as
this
surely
not
and
this
thou
hast
so
amply
demonstrated
that
no
word
more
is
needed
then
these
things
seem
to
give
to
mortals
shadows
of
the
true
good
or
some
kind
of
imperfect
good
but
the
true
and
perfect
good
they
can
not
bestow
so
said
i
then
thou
hast
learnt
what
that
true
happiness
is
and
what
men
falsely
call
happiness
it
now
remains
that
thou
shouldst
learn
from
what
source
to
seek
this
to
this
i
have
long
been
eagerly
looking
forward
since
as
plato
maintains
in
the
timæus
we
ought
even
in
the
most
trivial
matters
to
implore
the
divine
protection
what
thinkest
thou
should
we
now
do
in
order
to
deserve
to
find
the
seat
of
that
highest
good

invoke

footnotes
i
the
substance
of
this
poem
is
taken
from
plato
see
jowett
vol
pp
third
edition
x
now
thou
hast
seen
what
is
the
form
of
the
imperfect
good
and
what
the
form
of
the
perfect
also
methinks
i
should
next
show
in
what
manner
this
perfection
of
felicity
is
built
up
and
here
i
conceive
it
proper
to
inquire
first
whether
any
excellence
such
as
thou
hast
lately
defined
can
exist
in
the
nature
of
things
lest
we
be
deceived
by
an
empty
fiction
of
thought
to
which
no
true
reality
answers
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
such
does
exist
and
is
as
it
were
the
source
of
all
things
good
for
everything
which
is
called
imperfect
is
spoken
of
as
imperfect
by
reason
of
the
privation
of
some
perfection
so
it
comes
to
pass
that
whenever
imperfection
is
found
in
any
particular
there
must
necessarily
be
a
perfection
in
respect
of
that
particular
also
for
were
there
no
such
perfection
it
is
utterly
inconceivable
how
that
should
come
into
existence
nature
does
not
make
a
beginning
with
things
mutilated
and
imperfect
she
starts
with
what
is
whole
and
perfect
and
falls
away
later
to
these
feeble
and
inferior
productions
so
if
there
is
as
we
showed
before
a
happiness
of
a
frail
and
imperfect
kind
it
can
not
be
doubted
but
there
is
also
a
happiness
substantial
and
perfect
true
is
thy
conclusion
and
most
sure
said
i
to
consider
where
the
of
this
happiness
may
be
the
common
belief
of
all
mankind
agrees
that
god
the
supreme
of
all
things
is
good
for
since
nothing
can
be
imagined
better
than
god
how
can
we
doubt
him
to
be
good
than
whom
there
is
nothing
better
now
reason
shows
god
to
be
good
in
such
wise
as
to
prove
that
in
him
is
perfect
good
for
were
it
not
so
he
would
not
be
supreme
of
all
things
for
there
would
be
something
else
more
excellent
possessed
of
perfect
good
which
would
seem
to
have
the
advantage
in
priority
and
dignity
since
it
has
clearly
appeared
that
all
perfect
things
are
prior
to
those
less
complete
wherefore
lest
we
fall
into
an
infinite
regression
we
must
acknowledge
the
supreme
god
to
be
full
of
supreme
and
perfect
good
but
we
have
determined
that
true
happiness
is
the
perfect
good
therefore
true
happiness
must
dwell
in
the
supreme
deity
accept
thy
reasonings
said
i
can
not
in
any
wise
be
disputed
come
see
how
strictly
and
incontrovertibly
thou
mayst
prove
this
our
assertion
that
the
supreme
godhead
hath
fullest
possession
of
the
highest
good
what
way
pray
said
i
not
rashly
suppose
that
he
who
is
the
father
of
all
things
hath
received
that
highest
good
of
which
he
is
said
to
be
possessed
either
from
some
external
source
or
hath
it
as
a
natural
endowment
in
such
sort
that
thou
mightest
consider
the
essence
of
the
happiness
possessed
and
of
the
god
who
possesses
it
distinct
and
different
for
if
thou
deemest
it
received
from
without
thou
mayst
esteem
that
which
gives
more
excellent
than
that
which
has
received
but
him
we
most
worthily
acknowledge
to
be
the
most
supremely
excellent
of
all
things
if
however
it
is
in
him
by
nature
yet
is
logically
distinct
the
thought
is
inconceivable
since
we
are
speaking
of
god
who
is
supreme
of
all
things
who
was
there
to
join
these
distinct
essences
finally
when
one
thing
is
different
from
another
the
things
so
conceived
as
distinct
can
not
be
identical
therefore
that
which
of
its
own
nature
is
distinct
from
the
highest
good
is
not
itself
the
highest
good
an
impious
thought
of
him
than
whom
is
plain
nothing
can
be
more
excellent
for
universally
nothing
can
be
better
in
nature
than
the
source
from
which
it
has
come
therefore
on
most
true
grounds
of
reason
would
i
conclude
that
which
is
the
source
of
all
things
to
be
in
its
own
essence
the
highest
good
most
justly
said
i
the
highest
good
has
been
admitted
to
be
happiness
said
she
is
necessary
to
acknowledge
that
god
is
very
happiness
said
i
can
not
gainsay
my
former
admissions
and
i
see
clearly
that
this
is
a
necessary
inference
therefrom
also
said
she
the
same
conclusion
is
not
further
confirmed
by
considering
that
there
can
not
be
two
supreme
goods
distinct
one
from
the
other
for
the
goods
which
are
different
clearly
can
not
be
severally
each
what
the
other
is
wherefore
neither
of
the
two
can
be
perfect
since
to
either
the
other
is
wanting
but
since
it
is
not
perfect
it
can
not
manifestly
be
the
supreme
good
by
no
means
then
can
goods
which
are
supreme
be
different
one
from
the
other
but
we
have
concluded
that
both
happiness
and
god
are
the
supreme
good
wherefore
that
which
is
highest
divinity
must
also
itself
necessarily
be
supreme
happiness
conclusion
said
i
be
truer
to
fact
nor
more
soundly
reasoned
out
nor
more
worthy
of
god
further
said
she
as
geometricians
are
wont
to
draw
inferences
from
their
demonstrations
to
which
they
give
the
name
deductions
so
will
i
add
here
a
sort
of
corollary
for
since
men
become
happy
by
the
acquisition
of
happiness
while
happiness
is
very
godship
it
is
manifest
that
they
become
happy
by
the
acquisition
of
godship
but
as
by
the
acquisition
of
justice
men
become
just
and
wise
by
the
acquisition
of
wisdom
so
by
parity
of
reasoning
by
acquiring
godship
they
must
of
necessity
become
gods
so
every
man
who
is
happy
is
a
god
and
though
in
nature
god
is
one
only
yet
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
that
very
many
should
be
gods
by
participation
in
that
nature
fair
conclusion
and
a
precious
said
i
or
corollary
by
whichever
name
thou
wilt
call
it
yet
said
she
one
whit
fairer
than
this
which
reason
persuades
us
to
add
what
said
i
seeing
happiness
has
many
particulars
included
under
it
should
all
these
be
regarded
as
forming
one
body
of
happiness
as
it
were
made
up
of
various
parts
or
is
there
some
one
of
them
which
forms
the
full
essence
of
happiness
while
all
the
rest
are
relative
to
this
would
thou
wouldst
unfold
the
whole
matter
to
me
at
large
judge
happiness
to
be
good
do
we
not
the
supreme
good
this
superlative
applies
to
all
for
this
same
happiness
is
adjudged
to
be
the
completest
independence
the
highest
power
reverence
renown
and
pleasure
then
all
these
goods
independence
power
and
the
rest
to
be
deemed
members
of
happiness
as
it
were
or
are
they
all
relative
to
good
as
to
their
summit
and
crown
understand
the
problem
but
i
desire
to
hear
how
thou
wouldst
solve
it
then
listen
to
the
determination
of
the
matter
were
all
these
members
composing
happiness
they
would
differ
severally
one
from
the
other
for
this
is
the
nature
of
parts
that
by
their
difference
they
compose
one
body
all
these
however
have
been
proved
to
be
the
same
therefore
they
can
not
possibly
be
members
otherwise
happiness
will
seem
to
be
built
up
out
of
one
member
which
can
not
be
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
that
said
i
i
am
impatient
to
hear
what
remains
it
is
manifest
that
all
the
others
are
relative
to
the
good
for
the
very
reason
why
independence
is
sought
is
that
it
is
judged
good
and
so
power
also
because
it
is
believed
to
be
good
the
same
too
may
be
supposed
of
reverence
of
renown
and
of
pleasant
delight
good
then
is
the
sum
and
source
of
all
desirable
things
that
which
has
not
in
itself
any
good
either
in
reality
or
in
semblance
can
in
no
wise
be
desired
contrariwise
even
things
which
by
nature
are
not
good
are
desired
as
if
they
were
truly
good
if
they
seem
to
be
so
whereby
it
comes
to
pass
that
goodness
is
rightly
believed
to
be
the
sum
and
hinge
and
cause
of
all
things
desirable
now
that
for
the
sake
of
which
anything
is
desired
itself
seems
to
be
most
wished
for
for
instance
if
anyone
wishes
to
ride
for
the
sake
of
health
he
does
not
so
much
wish
for
the
exercise
of
riding
as
the
benefit
of
his
health
since
then
all
things
are
sought
for
the
sake
of
the
good
it
is
not
these
so
much
as
good
itself
that
is
sought
by
all
but
that
on
account
of
which
all
other
things
are
wished
for
was
we
agreed
happiness
wherefore
thus
also
it
appears
that
it
is
happiness
alone
which
is
sought
from
all
which
it
is
transparently
clear
that
the
essence
of
absolute
good
and
of
happiness
is
one
and
the
same
can
not
see
how
anyone
can
dissent
from
these
conclusions
we
have
also
proved
that
god
and
true
happiness
are
one
and
the
same
said
i
we
can
safely
conclude
also
that
god
essence
is
seated
in
absolute
good
and
nowhere
else

thy

hold
admirably
together

thou
put
upon

shouldst
thou
come

the
knowledge
of
the
absolute
good
an
infinite
said
i
only
i
were
so
blest
as
to
learn
to
know
god
also
who
is
the
good
this
will
i
make
clear
to
thee
on
truest
grounds
of
reason
if
only
our
recent
conclusions
stand
fast
will
we
not
shown
that
those
things
which
most
men
desire
are
not
true
and
perfect
good
precisely
for
this
cause
that
they
differ
severally
one
from
another
and
seeing
that
one
is
wanting
to
another
they
can
not
bestow
full
and
absolute
good
but
that
they
become
the
true
good
when
they
are
gathered
as
it
were
into
one
form
and
agency
so
that
that
which
is
independence
is
likewise
power
reverence
renown
and
pleasant
delight
and
unless
they
are
all
one
and
the
same
they
have
no
claim
to
be
counted
among
things
desirable
this
was
clearly
proved
and
can
not
in
any
wise
be
doubted
when
things
are
far
from
being
good
while
they
are
different
but
become
good
as
soon
as
they
are
one
is
it
not
true
that
these
become
good
by
acquiring
unity
seems
so
said
i
dost
not
thou
allow
that
all
which
is
good
is
good
by
participation
in
goodness
is
thou
must
on
similar
grounds
admit
that
unity
and
goodness
are
the
same
for
when
the
effects
of
things
in
their
natural
working
differ
not
their
essence
is
one
and
the
same
is
no
denying
it
dost
thou
know
said
she
all
which
is
abides
and
subsists
so
long
as
it
continues
one
but
so
soon
as
it
ceases
to
be
one
it
perishes
and
falls
to
pieces
what
way
take
animals
for
example
when
soul
and
body
come
together
and
continue
in
one
this
is
we
say
a
living
creature
but
when
this
unity
is
broken
by
the
separation
of
these
two
the
creature
dies
and
is
clearly
no
longer
living
the
body
also
while
it
remains
in
one
form
by
the
joining
together
of
its
members
presents
a
human
appearance
but
if
the
separation
and
dispersal
of
the
parts
break
up
the
body
unity
it
ceases
to
be
what
it
was
and
if
we
extend
our
survey
to
all
other
things
without
doubt
it
will
manifestly
appear
that
each
several
thing
subsists
while
it
is
one
but
when
it
ceases
to
be
one
perishes
when
i
consider
further
i
see
it
to
be
even
as
thou
sayest
is
there
aught
said
she
in
so
far
as
it
acts
conformably
to
nature
abandons
the
wish
for
life
and
desires
to
come
to
death
and
corruption
to
living
creatures
which
have
some
faults
of
choice
i
find
none
that
without
external
compulsion
forego
the
will
to
live
and
of
their
own
accord
hasten
to
destruction
for
every
creature
diligently
pursues
the
end
of
and
shuns
death
and
destruction
as
to
herbs
and
trees
and
inanimate
things
generally
i
am
altogether
in
doubt
what
to
think
yet
there
is
no
possibility
of
question
about
this
either
since
thou
seest
how
herbs
and
trees
grow
in
places
suitable
for
them
where
as
far
as
their
nature
admits
they
can
not
quickly
wither
and
die
some
spring
up
in
the
plains
others
in
the
mountains
some
grow
in
marshes
others
cling
to
rocks
and
others
again
find
a
fertile
soil
in
the
barren
sands
and
if
you
try
to
transplant
these
elsewhere
they
wither
away
nature
gives
to
each
the
soil
that
suits
it
and
uses
her
diligence
to
prevent
any
of
them
dying
so
long
as
it
is
possible
for
them
to
continue
alive
why
do
they
all
draw
their
nourishment
from
roots
as
from
a
mouth
dipped
into
the
earth
and
distribute
the
strong
bark
over
the
pith
why
are
all
the
softer
parts
like
the
pith
deeply
encased
within
while
the
external
parts
have
the
strong
texture
of
wood
and
outside
of
all
is
the
bark
to
resist
the
inclemency
like
a
champion
stout
in
endurance
again
how
great
is
nature
diligence
to
secure
universal
propagation
by
multiplying
seed
who
does
not
know
all
these
to
be
contrivances
not
only
for
the
present
maintenance
of
a
species
but
for
its
lasting
continuance
generation
after
generation
for
ever
and
do
not
also
the
things
believed
inanimate
on
like
grounds
of
reason
seek
each
what
is
proper
to
itself
why
do
the
flames
shoot
lightly
upward
while
the
earth
presses
downward
with
its
weight
if
it
is
not
that
these
motions
and
situations
are
suitable
to
their
respective
natures
moreover
each
several
thing
is
preserved
by
that
which
is
agreeable
to
its
nature
even
as
it
is
destroyed
by
things
inimical
things
solid
like
stones
resist
disintegration
by
the
close
adhesion
of
their
parts
things
fluid
like
air
and
water
yield
easily
to
what
divides
them
but
swiftly
flow
back
and
mingle
with
those
parts
from
which
they
have
been
severed
while
fire
again
refuses
to
be
cut
at
all
and
we
are
not
now
treating
of
the
voluntary
motions
of
an
intelligent
soul
but
of
the
drift
of
nature
even
so
is
it
that
we
digest
our
food
without
thinking
about
it
and
draw
our
breath
unconsciously
in
sleep
nay
even
in
living
creatures
the
love
of
life
cometh
not
of
conscious
will
but
from
the
principles
of
nature
for
oftentimes
in
the
stress
of
circumstances
will
chooses
the
death
which
nature
shrinks
from
and
contrarily
in
spite
of
natural
appetite
will
restrains
that
work
of
reproduction
by
which
alone
the
persistence
of
perishable
creatures
is
maintained
so
entirely
does
this
love
of
self
come
from
drift
of
nature
not
from
animal
impulse
providence
has
furnished
things
with
this
most
cogent
reason
for
continuance
they
must
desire
life
so
long
as
it
is
naturally
possible
for
them
to
continue
living
wherefore
in
no
way
mayst
thou
doubt
but
that
things
naturally
aim
at
continuance
of
existence
and
shun
destruction
confess
said
i
what
i
lately
thought
uncertain
i
now
perceive
to
be
indubitably
clear
that
which
seeks
to
subsist
and
continue
desires
to
be
one
for
if
its
oneness
be
gone
its
very
existence
can
not
continue
said
i
things
then
desire
to
be
one
agree
we
have
proved
that
one
is
the
very
same
thing
as
good
have
things
then
seek
the
good
indeed
you
may
express
the
fact
by
defining
good
as
that
which
all
desire
could
be
more
truly
thought
out
either
there
is
no
single
end
to
which
all
things
are
relative
or
else
the
end
to
which
all
things
universally
hasten
must
be
the
highest
good
of
all
then
she
do
i
rejoice
dear
pupil
thine
eye
is
now
fixed
on
the
very
central
mark
of
truth
moreover
herein
is
revealed
that
of
which
thou
didst
erstwhile
profess
thyself
ignorant
is
that
said
i
end
and
aim
of
the
whole
universe
surely
it
is
that
which
is
desired
of
all
and
since
we
have
concluded
the
good
to
be
such
we
ought
to
acknowledge
the
end
and
aim
of
the
whole

at

then
said
i
all
my
heart
i
agree
with
plato
indeed
this
is
now
the
second
time
that
these
things
have
been
brought
back
to
my
mind
first
i
lost
them
through
the
clogging
contact
of
the
body
then
after
through
the
stress
of
heavy
grief
then
she
continued
thou
wilt
reflect
upon
thy
former
admissions
it
will
not
be

before
thou
dost

of

erstwhile
thou
didst

said
she
i
remember
my
confession
and
although
i
now
anticipate
what
thou
intendest
i
have
a
desire
to
hear
the
argument
plainly
set
forth
ago
thou
deemedst
it
beyond
all
doubt
that
god
doth
govern
the
world
do
not
think
it
doubtful
now
nor
shall
i
ever
and
by
what
reasons
i
am
brought
to
this
assurance
i
will
briefly
set
forth
this
world
could
never
have
taken
shape
as
a
single
system
out
of
parts
so
diverse
and
opposite
were
it
not
that
there
is
one
who
joins
together
these
so
diverse
things
and
when
it
had
once
come
together
the
very
diversity
of
natures
would
have
dissevered
it
and
torn
it
asunder
in
universal
discord
were
there
not
one
who
keeps
together
what
he
has
joined
nor
would
the
order
of
nature
proceed
so
regularly
nor
could
its
course
exhibit
motions
so
fixed
in
respect
of
position
time
range
efficacy
and
character
unless
there
were
one
who
himself
abiding
disposed
these
various
vicissitudes
of
change
this
power
whatsoever
it
be
whereby
they
remain
as
they
were
created
and
are
kept
in
motion
i
call
by
the
name
which
all
recognise
god
then
said
she
that
such
is
thy
belief
it
will
cost
me
little
trouble
i
think
to
enable
thee
to
win
happiness
and
return
in
safety
to
thy
own
country
but
let
us
give
our
attention
to
the
task
that
we
have
set
before
ourselves
have
we
not
counted
independence
in
the
category
of
happiness
and
agreed
that
god
is
absolute
happiness
we
have
he
will
need
no
external
assistance
for
the
ruling
of
the
world
otherwise
if
he
stands
in
need
of
aught
he
will
not
possess
complete
independence
is
necessarily
so
said
i
by
his
own
power
alone
he
disposes
all
things
can
not
be
denied
god
was
proved
to
be
absolute
good
i
remember
he
disposes
all
things
by
the
agency
of
good
if
it
be
true
that
rules
all
things
by
his
own
power
whom
we
have
agreed
to
be
good
and
he
is
as
it
were
the
rudder
and
helm
by
which
the
mechanism
is
kept
steady
and
in
order
do
i
agree
and
indeed
i
anticipated
what
thou
wouldst
say
though
it
may
be
in
feeble
surmise
only
well
believe
it
said
she
as
i
think
thou
now
bringest
to
the
search
eyes
quicker
in
discerning
truth
but
what
i
shall
say
next
is
no
less
plain
and
easy
to
see
is
it
said
i
said
she
god
is
rightly
believed
to
govern
all
things
with
the
rudder
of
goodness
and
since
all
things
do
likewise
as
i
have
taught
haste
towards
good
by
the
very
aim
of
nature
can
it
be
doubted
that
his
governance
is
willingly
accepted
and
that
all
submit
themselves
to
the
sway
of
the
disposer
as
conformed
and
attempered
to
his
rule
so
said
i
rule
would
seem
happy
if
it
were
a
yoke
imposed
on
reluctant
wills
and
not
the
of
obedient
subjects
is
nothing
then
which
while
it
follows
nature
endeavours
to
resist
good
nothing
if
anything
should
will
it
have
the
least
success
against
him
whom
we
rightly
agreed
to
be
supreme
lord
of
happiness
would
be
utterly
impotent
is
nothing
then
which
has
either
the
will
or
the
power
to
oppose
this
supreme
good
i
think
not
then
said
she
is
the
supreme
good
which
rules
in
strength
and
graciously
disposes
all
things
then
said
i
delighted
am
i
at
thy
reasonings
and
the
conclusion
to
which
thou
hast
brought
them
but
most
of
all
at
these
very
words
which
thou
usest
i
am
now
at
last
ashamed
of
the
folly
that
so
sorely
vexed
me
hast
heard
the
story
of
the
giants
assailing
heaven
but
a
beneficent
strength
disposed
of
them
also
as
they
deserved
but
shall
we
submit
our
arguments
to
the
shock
of
mutual
collision
it
may
be
from
the
impact
some
fair
spark
of
truth
may
be
struck
out
it
be
thy
good
pleasure
said
i
one
can
doubt
that
god
is
one
at
all
can
question
it
who
thinks
consistently
there
is
nothing
which
one
who
is
can
not
do
can
god
do
evil
then
by
no
means
evil
is
nothing
said
she
he
to
whom
nothing
is
impossible
is
unable
to
do
evil
thou
mocking
me
said
i
a
labyrinth
of
tangled
arguments
now
seeming
to
begin
where
thou
didst
end
and
now
to
end
where
thou
didst
begin
or
dost
thou
build
up
some
wondrous
circle
of
divine
simplicity
for
truly
a
little
before
thou
didst
begin
with
happiness
and
say
it
was
the
supreme
good
and
didst
declare
it
to
be
seated
in
the
supreme
godhead
god
himself
too
thou
didst
affirm
to
be
supreme
good
and
happiness
and
from
this
thou
didst
go
on
to
add
as
by
the
way
the
proof
that
no
one
would
be
happy
unless
he
were
likewise
god
again
thou
didst
say
that
the
very
form
of
good
was
the
essence
both
of
god
and
of
happiness
and
didst
teach
that
the
absolute
one
was
the
absolute
good
which
was
sought
by
universal
nature
thou
didst
maintain
also
that
god
rules
the
universe
by
the
governance
of
goodness
that
all
things
obey
him
willingly
and
that
evil
has
no
existence
in
nature
and
all
this
thou
didst
unfold
without
the
help
of
assumptions
from
without
but
by
inherent
and
proper
proofs
drawing
credence
one
from
the
other
then
answered
she
is
it
from
me
to
mock
thee
nay
by
the
blessing
of
god
whom
we
lately
addressed
in
prayer
we
have
achieved
the
most
important
of
all
objects
for
such
is
the
form
of
the
divine
essence

neither
can
it
pass
into
things
external

take
up
anything

thee

aught
of
the

of
her
expression
or

then
forasmuch
as
i
was
as
yet
unable
to
forget
my
sorrow
just
as
she
was
about
to
say
something
further
i
broke
in
and
cried
thou
guide
into
the
way
of
true
light
all
that
thy
voice
hath
uttered
from
the
beginning
even
unto
now
has
manifestly
seemed
to
me
at
once
divine
contemplated
in
itself
and
by
the
force
of
thy
arguments
placed
beyond
the
possibility
of
overthrow
moreover
these
truths
have
not
been
altogether
unfamiliar
to
me
heretofore
though
because
of
indignation
at
my
wrongs
they
have
for
a
time
been
forgotten
but
lo
herein
is
the
very
chiefest
cause
of
my
grief
that
while
there
exists
a
good
ruler
of
the
universe
it
is
possible
that
evil
should
be
at
all
still
more
that
it
should
go
unpunished
surely
thou
must
see
how
deservedly
this
of
itself
provokes
astonishment
but
a
yet
greater
marvel
follows
while
wickedness
reigns
and
flourishes
virtue
not
only
lacks
its
reward
but
is
even
thrust
down
and
trampled
under
the
feet
of
the
wicked
and
suffers
punishment
in
the
place
of
crime
that
this
should
happen
under
the
rule
of
a
god
who
knows
all
things
and
can
do
all
things
but
wills
only
the
good
can
not
be
sufficiently
wondered
at
nor
sufficiently
lamented
then
said
she
would
indeed
be
infinitely
astounding
and
of
all
monstrous
things
most
horrible
if
as
thou
esteemest
in
the
home
of
so
great
a
householder
the
base
vessels
should
be
held
in
honour
the
precious
left
to
neglect
but
it
is
not
so
for
if
we
hold
unshaken
those
conclusions
which
we
lately
reached
thou
shall
learn
that
by
the
will
of
him
of
whose
realm
we
are
speaking
the
good
are
always
strong
the
bad
always
weak
and
impotent
that
vices
never
go
unpunished
nor
virtues
unrewarded
that
good
fortune
ever
befalls
the
good
and
ill
fortune
the
bad
and
much
more
of
the
sort
which
shall
hush
thy
murmurings
and
stablish
thee
in
the
strong
assurance
of
conviction
and
since
by
my
late
instructions
thou
hast
seen
the
form
of
happiness
hast
learnt
too
the
seat
where
it
is

due

return
safe

then
said
i
wondrous
great
are
thy
promises
yet
i
do
not
doubt
but
thou
canst
make
them
good
only
keep
me
not
in
suspense
after
raising
such
hopes
then
first
said
she
that
power
ever
waits
upon
the
good
while
the
bad
are
left
wholly
destitute
of
strength
k
of
these
truths
the
one
proves
the
other
for
since
good
and
evil
are
contraries
if
it
is
made
plain
that
good
is
power
the
feebleness
of
evil
is
clearly
seen
and
conversely
if
the
frail
nature
of
evil
is
made
manifest
the
strength
of
good
is
thereby
known
however
to
win
ampler
credence
for
my
conclusion
i
will
pursue
both
paths
and
draw
confirmation
for
my
statements
first
in
one
way
and
then
in
the
other
carrying
out
of
any
human
action
depends
upon
two
things
to
wit
will
and
power
if
either
be
wanting
nothing
can
be
accomplished
for
if
the
will
be
lacking
no
attempt
at
all
is
made
to
do
what
is
not
willed
whereas
if
there
be
no
power
the
will
is
all
in
vain
and
so
if
thou
seest
any
man
wishing
to
attain
some
end
yet
utterly
failing
to
attain
it
thou
canst
not
doubt
that
he
lacked
the
power
of
getting
what
he
wished
for
certainly
not
there
is
no
denying
it
thou
then
doubt
that
he
whom
thou
seest
to
have
accomplished
what
he
willed
had
also
the
power
to
accomplish
it
course
not
in
respect
of
what
he
can
accomplish
a
man
is
to
be
reckoned
strong
in
respect
of
what
he
can
not
accomplish
weak
said
i
dost
thou
remember
that
by
our
former
reasonings
it
was
concluded
that
the
whole
aim
of
man
will
though
the
means
of
pursuit
vary
is
set
intently
upon
happiness
do
remember
that
this
too
was
proved
thou
also
call
to
mind
how
happiness
is
absolute
good
and
therefore
that
when
happiness
is
sought
it
is
good
which
is
in
all
cases
the
object
of
desire
i
do
not
so
much
call
to
mind
as
keep
it
fixed
in
my
memory
all
men
good
and
bad
alike
with
one
indistinguishable
purpose
strive
to
reach
good
that
follows
it
is
certain
that
by
the
attainment
of
good
men
become
good
is
do
the
good
attain
their
object
seems
so
if
the
bad
were
to
attain
the
good
which
is
object
they
could
not
be
bad
since
both
seek
good
but
while
the
one
sort
attain
it
the
other
attain
it
not
is
there
any
doubt
that
the
good
are
endued
with
power
while
they
who
are
bad
are
weak
any
doubt
it
he
is
incapable
of
reflecting
on
the
nature
of
things
or
the
consequences
involved
in
reasoning
supposing
there
are
two
things
to
which
the
same
function
is
prescribed
in
the
course
of
nature
and
one
of
these
successfully
accomplishes
the
function
by
natural
action
the
other
is
altogether
incapable
of
that
natural
action
instead
of
which
in
a
way
other
than
is
agreeable
to
its
nature
it
i
will
not
say
fulfils
its
function
but
feigns
to
fulfil
it
which
of
these
two
would
in
thy
view
be
the
stronger
guess
thy
meaning
but
i
pray
thee
let
me
hear
thee
more
at
large
is
man
natural
motion
is
it
not
dost
not
doubt
i
suppose
that
it
is
natural
for
the
feet
to
discharge
this
function
surely
i
do
not
if
one
man
who
is
able
to
use
his
feet
walks
and
another
to
whom
the
natural
use
of
his
feet
is
wanting
tries
to
walk
on
his
hands
which
of
the
two
wouldst
thou
rightly
esteem
the
stronger
on
said
i
one
can
question
but
that
he
who
has
the
natural
capacity
has
more
strength
than
he
who
has
it
not
the
supreme
good
is
set
up
as
the
end
alike
for
the
bad
and
for
the
good
but
the
good
seek
it
through
the
natural
action
of
the
virtues
whereas
the
bad
try
to
attain
this
same
good
through
all
manner
of
concupiscence
which
is
not
the
natural
way
of
attaining
good
or
dost
thou
think
otherwise
rather
one
further
consequence
is
clear
to
me
for
from
my
admissions
it
must
needs
follow
that
the
good
have
power
and
the
bad
are
impotent
anticipatest
rightly
and
that
as
physicians
reckon
is
a
sign
that
nature
is
set
working
and
is
throwing
off
the
disease
but
since
i
see
thee
so
ready
at
understanding
i
will
heap
proof
on
proof
look
how
manifest
is
the
extremity
of
vicious
men
weakness
they
can
not
even
reach
that
goal
to
which
the
aim
of
nature
leads
and
almost
constrains
them
what
if
they
were
left
without
this
mighty
this
irresistible
help
of
nature
guidance
consider
also
how
momentous
is
the
powerlessness
which
incapacitates
the
wicked
not
light
or
trivial
l
are
the
prizes
which
they
contend
for
but
which
they
can
not
win
or
hold
nay
their
failure
concerns
the
very
sum
and
crown
of
things
poor
wretches
they
fail
to
compass
even
that
for
which
they
toil
day
and
night
herein
also
the
strength
of
the
good
conspicuously
appears
for
just
as
thou
wouldst
judge
him
to
be
the
strongest
walker
whose
legs
could
carry
him
to
a
point
beyond
which
no
further
advance
was
possible
so
must
thou
needs
account
him
strong
in
power
who
so
attains
the
end
of
his
desires
that
nothing
further
to
be
desired
lies
beyond
whence
follows
the
obvious
conclusion
that
they
who
are
wicked
are
seen
likewise
to
be
wholly
destitute
of
strength
for
why
do
they
forsake
virtue
and
follow
vice
is
it
from
ignorance
of
what
is
good
well
what
is
more
weak
and
feeble
than
the
blindness
of
ignorance
do
they
know
what
they
ought
to
follow
but
lust
drives
them
aside
out
of
the
way
if
it
be
so
they
are
still
frail
by
reason
of
their
incontinence
for
they
can
not
fight
against
vice
or
do
they
knowingly
and
wilfully
forsake
the
good
and
turn
aside
to
vice
why
at
this
rate
they
not
only
cease
to
have
power
but
cease
to
be
at
all
for
they
who
forsake
the
common
end
of
all
things
that
are
they
likewise
also
cease
to
be
at
all
now
to
some
it
may
seem
strange
that
we
should
assert
that
the
bad
who
form
the
greater
part
of
mankind
do
not
exist
but
the
fact
is
so
i
do
not
indeed
deny
that
they
who
are
bad
are
bad
but
that
they
in
an
unqualified
and
absolute
sense
i
deny
just
as
we
call
a
corpse
a
dead
man
but
can
not
call
it
simply
man
so
i
would
allow
the
vicious
to
be
bad
but
that
they
in
an
absolute
sense
i
can
not
allow
that
only
which
maintains
its
place
and
keeps
its
nature
whatever
falls
away
from
this
forsakes
the
existence
which
is
essential
to
its
nature
but
thou
wilt
say
the
bad
have
an
ability
nor
do
i
wish
to
deny
it
only
this
ability
of
theirs
comes
not
from
strength
but
from
impotence
for
their
ability
is
to
do
evil
which
would
have
had
no
efficacy
at
all
if
they
could
have
continued
in
the
performance
of
good
so
this
ability
of
theirs
proves
them
still
more
plainly
to
have
no
power
for
if
as
we
concluded
just
now
evil
is
nothing
is
clear
that
the
wicked
can
effect
nothing
since
they
are
only
able
to
do
evil
evident
that
thou
mayst
understand
what
is
the
precise
force
of
this
power
we
determined
did
we
not
awhile
back
that
nothing
has
more
power
than
supreme
good
did
said
i
that
same
highest
good
can
not
do
evil
not
there
anyone
then
who
thinks
that
men
are
able
to
do
all
things
but
a
madman
they
are
able
to
do
evil
would
they
could
not
then
he
who
can
do
only
good
is
omnipotent
while
they
who
can
do
evil
also
are
not
omnipotent
it
is
manifest
that
they
who
can
do
evil
have
less
power
there
is
this
also
we
have
shown
that
all
power
is
to
be
reckoned
among
things
desirable
and
that
all
desirable
things
are
referred
to
good
as
to
a
kind
of
consummation
of
their
nature
but
the
ability
to
commit
crime
can
not
be
referred
to
the
good
therefore
it
is
not
a
thing
to
be
desired
and
yet
all
power
is
desirable
it
is
clear
then
that
ability
to
do
evil
is
not
power
from
all
which
considerations
appeareth
the
power
of
the
good
and
the
indubitable
weakness
of
the
bad
and
it
is
clear
that
plato
judgment
was
true
the
wise
alone
are
able
to
do
what
they
would
while
the
wicked
follow
their
own
hearts
lust
but
can
accomplish
what
they
would
for
they
go
on
in
their
wilfulness
fancying
they
will
attain
what
they
wish
for
in
the
paths
of
delight
but
they
are
very
far
from
its
attainment
since
shameful
deeds
lead
not
to
happiness

iii
seest
then
in
what
foulness
unrighteous
deeds
are
sunk
with
what
splendour
righteousness
shines
whereby
it
is
manifest
that
goodness
never
lacks
its
reward
nor
crime
its
punishment
for
verily
in
all
manner
of
transactions
that
for
the
sake
of
which
the
particular
action
is
done
may
justly
be
accounted
the
reward
of
that
action
even
as
the
wreath
for
the
sake
of
which
the
race
is
run
is
the
reward
offered
for
running
now
we
have
shown
happiness
to
be
that
very
good
for
the
sake
of
which
all
things
are
done
absolute
good
then
is
offered
as
the
common
prize
as
it
were
of
all
human
actions
but
truly
this
is
a
reward
from
which
it
is
impossible
to
separate
the
good
man
for
one
who
is
without
good
can
not
properly
be
called
good
at
all
wherefore
righteous
dealing
never
misses
its
reward
rage
the
wicked
then
never
so
violently
the
crown
shall
not
fall
from
the
head
of
the
wise
nor
wither
verily
other
men
unrighteousness
can
not
pluck
from
righteous
souls
their
proper
glory
were
the
reward
in
which
the
soul
of
the
righteous
delighteth
received
from
without
then
might
it
be
taken
away
by
him
who
gave
it
or
some
other
but
since
it
is
conferred
by
his
own
righteousness
then
only
will
he
lose
his
prize
when
he
has
ceased
to
be
righteous
lastly
since
every
prize
is
desired
because
it
is
believed
to
be
good
who
can
account
him
who
possesses
good
to
be
without
reward
and
what
a
prize
the
fairest
and
grandest
of
all
for
remember
the
corollary
which
i
chiefly
insisted
on
a
little
while
back
and
reason
thus
since
absolute
good
is
happiness
is
clear
that
all
the
good
must
be
happy
for
the
very
reason
that
they
are
good
but
it
was
agreed
that
those
who
are
happy
are
gods
so
then
the
prize
of
the
good
is
one
which
no
time
may
impair
no
man
power
lessen
no
unrighteousness
tarnish
is
very
godship
and
this
being
so
the
wise
man
can
not
doubt
that
punishment
is
inseparable
from
the
bad
for
since
good
and
bad
and
likewise
reward
and
punishment
are
contraries
it
necessarily
follows
that
corresponding
to
all
that
we
see
accrue
as
reward
of
the
good
there
is
some
penalty
attached
as
punishment
of
evil
as
then
righteousness
itself
is
the
reward
of
the
righteous
so
wickedness
itself
is
the
punishment
of
the
unrighteous
now
no
one
who
is
visited
with
punishment
doubts
that
he
is
visited
with
evil
accordingly
if
they
were
but
willing
to
weigh
their
own
case
could
think
themselves
free
from
punishment
whom
wickedness
worst
of
all
evils
has
not
only
touched
but
deeply
tainted
also
from
the
opposite
standpoint
the
standpoint
of
the
good
what
a
penalty
attends
upon
the
wicked
thou
didst
learn
a
little
since
that
whatever
is
is
one
and
that
unity
itself
is
good
accordingly
by
this
way
of
reckoning
whatever
falls
away
from
goodness
ceases
to
be
whence
it
comes
to
pass
that
the
bad
cease
to
be
what
they
were
while
only
the
outward
aspect
is
still
left
to
show
they
have
been
men
wherefore
by
their
perversion
to
badness
they
have
lost
their
true
human
nature
further
since
righteousness
alone
can
raise
men
above
the
level
of
humanity
it
must
needs
be
that
unrighteousness
degrades
below
man
level
those
whom
it
has
cast
out
of
man
estate
it
results
then
that
thou
canst
not
consider
him
human
whom
thou
seest
transformed
by
vice
the
violent
despoiler
of
other
men
goods
enflamed
with
covetousness
surely
resembles
a
wolf
a
bold
and
restless
spirit
ever
wrangling
in
is
like
some
yelping
cur
the
secret
schemer
taking
pleasure
in
fraud
and
stealth
is
own
brother
to
the
fox
the
passionate
man
phrenzied
with
rage
we
might
believe
to
be
animated
with
the
soul
of
a
lion
the
coward
and
runaway
afraid
where
no
fear
is
may
be
likened
to
the
timid
deer
he
who
is
sunk
in
ignorance
and
stupidity
lives
like
a
dull
ass
he
who
is
light
and
inconstant
never
holding
long
to
one
thing
is
for
all
the
world
like
a
bird
he
who
wallows
in
foul
and
unclean
lusts
is
sunk
in
the
pleasures
of
a
filthy
hog
so
it
comes
to
pass
that
he
who
by
forsaking
righteousness
ceases
to
be
a
man
can
not
pass
into
a
godlike
condition
but
actually
turns
into

iv
then
said
i
is
very
true
i
see
that
the
vicious
though
they
keep
the
outward
form
of
man
are
rightly
said
to
be
changed
into
beasts
in
respect
of
their
spiritual
nature
but
inasmuch
as
their
cruel
and
polluted
minds
vent
their
rage
in
the
destruction
of
the
good
i
would
this
license
were
not
permitted
to
them
is
it
said
she
shall
be
shown
in
the
fitting
place
yet
if
that
license
which
thou
believest
to
be
permitted
to
them
were
taken
away
the
punishment
of
the
wicked
would
be
in
great
part
remitted
for
verily
incredible
as
it
may
seem
to
some
it
needs
must
be
that
the
bad
are
more
unfortunate
when
they
have
accomplished
their
desires
than
if
they
are
unable
to
get
them
fulfilled
if
it
is
wretched
to
will
evil
to
have
been
able
to
accomplish
evil
is
more
wretched
for
without
the
power
the
wretched
will
would
fail
of
effect
accordingly
those
whom
thou
seest
to
will
to
be
able
to
accomplish
and
to
accomplish
crime
must
needs
be
the
victims
of
a
threefold
wretchedness
since
each
one
of
these
states
has
its
own
measure
of
wretchedness
said
i
i
earnestly
wish
they
might
speedily
be
quit
of
this
misfortune
by
losing
the
ability
to
accomplish
crime
will
lose
it
said
she
than
perchance
thou
wishest
or
they
themselves
think
likely
since
verily
within
the
narrow
bounds
of
our
brief
life
there
is
nothing
so
late
in
coming
that
anyone
least
of
all
an
immortal
spirit
should
deem
it
long
to
wait
for
their
great
expectations
the
lofty
fabric
of
their
crimes
is
oft
overthrown
by
a
sudden
and
ending
and
this
but
sets
a
limit
to
their
misery
for
if
wickedness
makes
men
wretched
he
is
necessarily
more
wretched
who
is
wicked
for
a
longer
time
and
were
it
not
that
death
at
all
events
puts
an
end
to
the
evil
doings
of
the
wicked
i
should
account
them
wretched
to
the
last
degree
indeed
if
we
have
formed
true
conclusions
about
the
ill
fortune
of
wickedness
that
wretchedness
is
plainly
infinite
which
is
doomed
to
be
eternal
then
said
i
wonderful
inference
and
difficult
to
grant
but
i
see
that
it
agrees
entirely
with
our
previous
conclusions
art
right
said
she
if
anyone
finds
it
hard
to
admit
the
conclusion
he
ought
in
fairness
either
to
prove
some
falsity
in
the
premises
or
to
show
that
the
combination
of
propositions
does
not
adequately
enforce
the
necessity
of
the
conclusion
otherwise
if
the
premises
be
granted
nothing
whatever
can
be
said
against
the
inference
of
the
conclusion
and
here
is
another
statement
which
seems
not
less
wonderful
but
on
the
premises
assumed
is
equally
necessary
is
that
wicked
are
happier
in
undergoing
punishment
than
if
no
penalty
of
justice
chasten
them
and
i
am
not
now
meaning
what
might
occur
to
anyone
that
bad
character
is
amended
by
retribution
and
is
brought
into
the
right
path
by
the
terror
of
punishment
or
that
it
serves
as
an
example
to
warn
others
to
avoid
transgression
but
i
believe
that
in
another
way
the
wicked
are
more
unfortunate
when
they
go
unpunished
even
though
no
account
be
taken
of
amendment
and
no
regard
be
paid
to
example
what
other
way
is
there
beside
these
said
i
then
said
she
we
not
agreed
that
the
good
are
happy
and
the
evil
wretched
said
i
if
said
she
one
in
affliction
there
be
given
along
with
his
misery
some
good
thing
is
he
not
happier
than
one
whose
misery
is
misery
pure
and
simple
without
admixture
of
any
good
would
seem
so
if
to
one
thus
wretched
one
destitute
of
all
good
some
further
evil
be
added
besides
those
which
make
him
wretched
is
he
not
to
be
judged
far
more
unhappy
than
he
whose
ill
fortune
is
alleviated
by
some
share
of
good
could
scarcely
be
otherwise
then
the
wicked
when
they
are
punished
have
a
good
thing
added
to
them
to
wit
the
punishment
which
by
the
law
of
justice
is
good
and
likewise
when
they
escape
punishment
a
new
evil
attaches
to
them
in
that
very
freedom
from
punishment
which
thou
hast
rightly
acknowledged
to
be
an
evil
in
the
case
of
the
unrighteous
can
not
deny
it
the
wicked
are
far
more
unhappy
when
indulged
with
an
unjust
freedom
from
punishment
than
when
punished
by
a
just
retribution
now
it
is
manifest
that
it
is
just
for
the
wicked
to
be
punished
and
for
them
to
escape
unpunished
is
unjust
who
would
venture
to
deny
it
too
no
one
can
possibly
deny
that
all
which
is
just
is
good
and
conversely
all
which
is
unjust
is
bad
then
i
answered
inferences
do
indeed
follow
from
what
we
lately
concluded
but
tell
me
said
i
thou
take
no
account
of
the
punishment
of
the
soul
after
the
death
of
the
body
truly
said
she
are
these
penalties
some
of
them
inflicted
i
imagine
in
the
severity
of
retribution
others
in
the
mercy
of
purification
but
it
is
not
my
present
purpose
to
speak
of
these
so
far
my
aim
hath
been
to
make
thee
recognise
that
the
power
of
the
bad
which
shocked
thee
so
exceedingly
is
no
power
to
make
thee
see
that
those
of
whose
freedom
from
punishment
thou
didst
complain
are
never
without
the
proper
penalties
of
their
unrighteousness
to
teach
thee
that
the
license
which
thou
prayedst
might
soon
come
to
an
end
is
not
that
it
would
be
more
unhappy
if
it
lasted
longer
most
unhappy
of
all
if
it
lasted
for
ever
thereafter
that
the
unrighteous
are
more
wretched
if
unjustly
let
go
without
punishment
than
if
punished
by
a
just
retribution
from
which
point
of
view
it
follows
that
the
wicked
are
afflicted
with
more
severe
penalties
just
when
they
are
supposed
to
escape
punishment
then
said
i
i
follow
thy
reasonings
i
am
deeply
impressed
with
their
truth
but
if
i
turn
to
the
common
convictions
of
men
i
find
few
who
will
even
listen
to
such
arguments
let
alone
admit
them
to
be
credible
said
she
can
not
lift
eyes
accustomed
to
darkness
to
the
light
of
clear
truth
and
are
like
those
birds
whose
vision
night
illumines
and
day
blinds
for
while
they
regard
not
the
order
of
the
universe
but
their
own
dispositions
of
mind
they
think
the
license
to
commit
crime
and
the
escape
from
punishment
to
be
fortunate
but
mark
the
ordinance
of
eternal
law
hast
thou
fashioned
thy
soul
to
the
likeness
of
the
better
thou
hast
no
need
of
a
judge
to
award
the
prize
by
thine
own
act
hast
thou
raised
thyself
in
the
scale
of
excellence
hast
thou
perverted
thy
affections
to
baser
things
look
not
for
punishment
from
one
without
thee
thine
own
act
hath
degraded
thee
and
thrust
thee
down
even
so
if
alternately
thou
turn
thy
gaze
upon
the
vile
earth
and
upon
the
heavens
though
all
without
thee
stand
still
by
the
mere
laws
of
sight
thou
seemest
now
sunk
in
the
mire
now
soaring
among
the
stars
but
the
common
herd
regards
not
these
things
what
then
shall
we
go
over
to
those
whom
we
have
shown
to
be
like
brute
beasts
why
suppose
now
one
who
had
quite
lost
his
sight
should
likewise
forget
that
he
had
ever
possessed
the
faculty
of
vision
and
should
imagine
that
nothing
was
wanting
in
him
to
human
perfection
should
we
deem
those
who
saw
as
well
as
ever
blind
why
they
will
not
even
assent
to
this
either
that
they
who
do
wrong
are
more
wretched
than
those
who
suffer
wrong
though
the
proof
of
this
rests
on
grounds
of
reason
no
less
strong
me
hear
these
same
reasons
said
i
thou
deny
that
every
wicked
man
deserves
punishment
would
not
certainly
that
those
who
are
wicked
are
unhappy
is
clear
in
manifold
ways
i
replied
dost
not
doubt
then
that
those
who
deserve
punishment
are
wretched
said
i
then
if
thou
wert
sitting
in
judgment
on
whom
wouldst
thou
decree
the
infliction
of
punishment
on
him
who
had
done
the
wrong
or
on
him
who
had
suffered
it
doubt
i
would
compensate
the
sufferer
at
the
cost
of
the
doer
of
the
wrong
the
injurer
would
seem
more
wretched
than
the
injured
it
follows
and
so
for
this
and
other
reasons
resting
on
the
same
ground
inasmuch
as
baseness
of
its
own
nature
makes
men
wretched
it
is
plain
that
a
wrong
involves
the
misery
of
the
doer
not
of
the
sufferer
yet
says
she
practice
of
the
is
just
the
opposite
advocates
try
to
arouse
the
commiseration
of
the
judges
for
those
who
have
endured
some
grievous
and
cruel
wrong
whereas
pity
is
rather
due
to
the
criminal
who
ought
to
be
brought
to
the
by
his
accusers
in
a
spirit
not
of
anger
but
of
compassion
and
kindness
as
a
sick
man
to
the
physician
to
have
the
ulcer
of
his
fault
cut
away
by
punishment
whereby
the
business
of
the
advocate
would
either
wholly
come
to
a
standstill
or
did
men
prefer
to
make
it
serviceable
to
mankind
would
be
restricted
to
the
practice
of
accusation
the
wicked
themselves
also
if
through
some
chink
or
cranny
they
were
permitted
to
behold
the
virtue
they
have
forsaken
and
were
to
see
that
by
the
pains
of
punishment
they
would
rid
themselves
of
the
uncleanness
of
their
vices
and
win
in
exchange
the
recompense
of
righteousness
they
would
no
longer
think
these
sufferings
pains
they
would
refuse
the
help
of
advocates
and
would
commit
themselves
wholly
into
the
hands
of
their
accusers
and
judges
whence
it
comes
to
pass
that
for
the
wise
no
place
is
left
for
hatred
only
the
most
foolish
would
hate
the
good
and
to
hate
the
bad
is
unreasonable
for
if
vicious
propensity
is
as
it
were
a
disease
of
the
soul
like
bodily
sickness
even
as
we
account
the
sick
in
body
by
no
means
deserving
of
hate
but
rather
of
pity
so
and
much
more
should
they
be
pitied
whose
minds
are
assailed
by
wickedness
which
is
more
frightful
than
any
sickness
song
iv
the
unreasonableness
of
hatred
why
all
this
furious
strife
oh
why
with
rash
and
wilful
hand
provoke
death
destined
day
if
death
ye
seek
lo
death
is
nigh
not
of
their
master
will
those
coursers
swift
delay
the
wild
beasts
vent
on
man
their
rage
yet
their
brothers
lives
men
point
the
murderous
steel
unjust
and
cruel
wars
they
wage
and
haste
with
flying
darts
the
death
to
meet
or
deal
no
right
nor
reason
can
they
show
is
but
because
their
lands
and
laws
are
not
the
same
wouldst
give
each
his
due
then
know
thy
love
the
good
must
have
the
bad
thy
pity
claim
on
this
i
said
see
how
there
is
a
happiness
and
misery
founded
on
the
actual
deserts
of
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
nevertheless
i
wonder
in
myself
whether
there
is
not
some
good
and
evil
in
fortune
as
the
vulgar
understand
it
surely
no
sensible
man
would
rather
be
exiled
poor
and
disgraced
than
dwell
prosperously
in
his
own
country
powerful
wealthy
and
high
in
honour
indeed
the
work
of
wisdom
is
more
clear
and
manifest
in
its
operation
when
the
happiness
of
rulers
is
somehow
passed
on
to
the
people
around
them
especially
considering
that
the
prison
the
law
and
the
other
pains
of
legal
punishment
are
properly
due
only
to
mischievous
citizens
on
whose
account
they
were
originally
instituted
accordingly
i
do
exceedingly
marvel
why
all
this
is
completely
reversed
why
the
good
are
harassed
with
the
penalties
due
to
crime
and
the
bad
carry
off
the
rewards
of
virtue
and
i
long
to
hear
from
thee
what
reason
may
be
found
for
so
unjust
a
state
of
disorder
for
assuredly
i
should
wonder
less
if
i
could
believe
that
all
things
are
the
confused
result
of
chance
but
now
my
belief
in
governance
doth
add
amazement
to
amazement
for
seeing
that
he
sometimes
assigns
fair
fortune
to
the
good
and
harsh
fortune
to
the
bad
and
then
again
deals
harshly
with
the
good
and
grants
to
the
bad
their
hearts
desire
how
does
this
differ
from
chance
unless
some
reason
is
discovered
for
it
all
it
is
not
wonderful
said
she
all
should
be
thought
random
and
confused

the
principle
of

is
not
known

though
thou
knowest
not
the
causes
on
which
this

depends

thee

to

of

did

the
mind
living
fire
to
suppress
them
for
there
come
within
its
scope
the
questions
of
the
essential
simplicity
of
providence
of
the
order
of
fate
of
unforeseen
chance
of
the
divine
knowledge
and
predestination
and
of
the
freedom
of
the
will
how
heavy
is
the
weight
of
all
this
thou
canst
judge
for
thyself
but
inasmuch
as
to
know
these
things
also
is
part
of
the
treatment
of
thy
malady
we
will
try
to
give
them
some
consideration
despite
the
restrictions
of
the
narrow
limits
of

moreover
thou
must
for
a
time
dispense
with
the
pleasures
of

so
be
that
thou
findest
any
delight
therein
whilst
i
weave
together
the
connected
train
of
reasons
in
proper
order
thou
wilt
said
i
then
as
if
making
a
new
beginning
she
thus
discoursed
coming
into
being
of
all
things
the
whole
course
of
development
in
things
that
change
every
sort
of
thing
that
moves
in
any
wise
receives
its
due
cause
order
and
form
from
the
steadfastness
of
the
divine
mind
this
mind
calm
in
the
citadel
of
its
own
essential
simplicity
has
decreed
that
the
method
of
its
rule
shall
be
manifold
viewed
in
the
very
purity
of
the
divine
intelligence
this
method
is
called
but
viewed
in
regard
to
those
things
which
it
moves
and
disposes
it
is
what
the
ancients
called
that
these
two
are
different
will
easily
be
clear
to
anyone
who
passes
in
review
their
respective
efficacies
providence
is
the
divine
reason
itself
seated
in
the
supreme
being
which
disposes
all
things
fate
is
the
disposition
inherent
in
all
things
which
move
through
which
providence
joins
all
things
in
their
proper
order
providence
embraces
all
things
however
different
however
infinite
fate
sets
in
motion
separately
individual
things
and
assigns
to
them
severally
their
position
form
and
time
the
unfolding
of
this
temporal
order
unified
into
the
foreview
of
the
divine
mind
is
providence
while
the
same
unity
broken
up
and
unfolded
in
time
is
fate
and
although
these
are
different
yet
is
there
a
dependence
between
them
for
the
order
of
destiny
issues
from
the
essential
simplicity
of
providence
for
as
the
artificer
forming
in
his
mind
beforehand
the
idea
of
the
thing
to
be
made
carries
out
his
design
and
develops
from
moment
to
moment
what
he
had
before
seen
in
a
single
instant
as
a
whole
so
god
in
his
providence
ordains
all
things
as
parts
of
a
single
unchanging
whole
but
carries
out
these
very
ordinances
by
fate
in
a
time
of
manifold
unity
so
whether
fate
is
accomplished
by
divine
spirits
as
the
ministers
of
providence
or
by
a
soul
or
by
the
service
of
all
nature
whether
by
the
celestial
motion
of
the
stars
by
the
efficacy
of
angels
or
by
the
cunning
of
demons
whether
by
all
or
by
some
of
these
the
destined
series
is
woven
this
at
least
is
manifest
that
providence
is
the
fixed
and
simple
form
of
destined
events
fate
their
shifting
series
in
order
of
time
as
by
the
disposal
of
the
divine
simplicity
they
are
to
take
place
whereby
it
is
that
all
things
which
are
under
fate
are
subjected
also
to
providence
on
which
fate
itself
is
dependent
whereas
certain
things
which
are
set
under
providence
are
above
the
chain
of
fate
those
things
which
by
their
nearness
to
the
primal
divinity
are
steadfastly
fixed
and
lie
outside
the
order
of
fate
movements
for
as
the
innermost
of
several
circles
revolving
round
the
same
centre
approaches
the
simplicity
of
the
midmost
point
and
is
as
it
were
a
pivot
round
which
the
exterior
circles
turn
while
the
outermost
whirled
in
ampler
orbit
takes
in
a
wider
and
wider
sweep
of
space
in
proportion
to
its
departure
from
the
indivisible
unity
of
the
centre
while
further
whatever
joins
and
allies
itself
to
the
centre
is
narrowed
to
a
like
simplicity
and
no
longer
expands
vaguely
into
space
even
so
whatsoever
departs
widely
from
primal
mind
is
involved
more
deeply
in
the
meshes
of
fate
and
things
are
free
from
fate
in
proportion
as
they
seek
to
come
nearer
to
that
central
pivot
while
if
aught
cleaves
close
to
supreme
mind
in
its
absolute
fixity
this
too
being
free
from
movement
rises
above
fate
necessity
therefore
as
is
reasoning
to
pure
intelligence
as
that
which
is
generated
to
that
which
is
time
to
eternity
a
circle
to
its
centre
so
is
the
shifting
series
of
fate
to
the
steadfastness
and
simplicity
of
providence
is
this
causal
series
which
moves
heaven
and
the
stars
attempers
the
elements
to
mutual
accord
and
again
in
turn
transforms
them
into
new
combinations
which
renews
the
series
of
all
things
that
are
born
and
die
through
like
successions
of
germ
and
birth
it
is
operation
which
binds
the
destinies
of
men
by
an
indissoluble
nexus
of
causality
and
since
it
issues
in
the
beginning
from
unalterable
providence
these
destinies
also
must
of
necessity
be
immutable
accordingly
the
world
is
ruled
for
the
best
if
this
unity
abiding
in
the
divine
mind
puts
forth
an
inflexible
order
of
causes
and
this
order
by
its
intrinsic
immutability
restricts
things
mutable
which
otherwise
would
ebb
and
flow
at
random
and
so
it
happens
that
although
to
you
who
are
not
altogether
capable
of
understanding
this
order
all
things
seem
confused
and
disordered
nevertheless
there
is
everywhere
an
appointed
limit
which
guides
all
things
to
good
verily
nothing
can
be
done
for
the
sake
of
evil
even
by
the
wicked
themselves
for
as
we
abundantly
proved
they
seek
good
but
are
drawn
out
of
the
way
by
perverse
error
far
less
can
this
order
which
sets
out
from
the
supreme
centre
of
good
turn
aside
anywhither
from
the
way
in
which
it
began
yet
what
confusion
thou
wilt
say
can
be
more
unrighteous
than
that
prosperity
and
adversity
should
indifferently
befall
the
good
what
they
like
and
what
they
loathe
come
alternately
to
the
bad
yes
but
have
men
in
real
life
such
soundness
of
mind
that
their
judgments
of
righteousness
and
wickedness
must
necessarily
correspond
with
facts
why
on
this
very
point
their
verdicts
conflict
and
those
whom
some
deem
worthy
of
reward
others
deem
worthy
of
punishment
yet
granted
there
were
one
who
could
rightly
distinguish
the
good
and
bad
yet
would
he
be
able
to
look
into
the
soul
inmost
constitution
as
it
were
if
we
may
borrow
an
expression
used
of
the
body
the
marvel
here
is
not
unlike
that
which
astonishes
one
who
does
not
know
why
in
health
sweet
things
suit
some
constitutions
and
bitter
others
or
why
some

are
best
alleviated

the
physician
who
distinguishes
the
precise
conditions
and
characteristics
of
health
and
sickness
does
not
marvel
now
the
health
of
the
soul
is
nothing
but
righteousness
and
vice
is
its
sickness
god
the
guide
and
physician
of
the
mind
it
is
who
preserves
the
good
and
banishes
the
bad
and
he
looks
forth
from
the
lofty
of
his
providence
perceives
what
is
suited
to
each
and
assigns
what
he
knows
to
be
suitable
then
is
what
that
extraordinary
mystery
of
the
order
of
destiny
comes
to
that
something
is
done
by
one
who
knows
whereat
the
ignorant
are
astonished
but
let
us
consider
a
few
instances
whereby
appears
what
is
the
competency
of
human
reason
to
fathom
the
divine
unsearchableness
here
is
one
whom
thou
deemest
the
perfection
of
justice
and
scrupulous
integrity
to
providence
it
seems
far
otherwise
we
all
know
our
lucan
admonition
that
it
was
the
winning
cause
that
found
favour
with
the
gods
the
beaten
cause
with
cato
so
shouldst
thou
see
anything
in
this
world
happening
differently
from
thy
expectation
doubt
not
but
events
are
rightly
ordered
it
is
in
thy
judgment
that
there
is
perverse
confusion
however
there
be
somewhere
found
one
of
so
happy
a
character
that
god
and
man
alike
agree
in
their
judgments
about
him
yet
is
he
somewhat
infirm
in
strength
of
mind
it
may
be
if
he
fall
into
adversity
he
will
cease
to
practise
that
innocency
which
has
failed
to
secure
his
fortune
therefore
god
wise
dispensation
spares
him
whom
adversity
might
make
worse
will
not
let
him
suffer
who
is
ill
fitted
for
endurance
another
there
is
perfect
in
all
virtue
so
holy
and
nigh
to
god
that
providence
judges
it
unlawful
that
aught
untoward
should
befall
him
nay
doth
not
even
permit
him
to
be
afflicted
with
bodily
disease
as
one
more
excellent
than
i
n
hath
said
the
very
body
of
the
holy
saint
is
built
of
purest
ether
often
it
happens
that
the
governance
is
given
to
the
good
that
a
restraint
may
be
put
upon
superfluity
of
wickedness
to
others
providence
assigns
some
mixed
lot
suited
to
their
spiritual
nature
some
it
will
plague
lest
they
grow
rank
through
long
prosperity
others
it
will
suffer
to
be
vexed
with
sore
afflictions
to
confirm
their
virtues
by
the
exercise
and
practice
of
patience
some
fear
overmuch
what
they
have
strength
to
bear
others
despise
overmuch
that
to
which
their
strength
is
unequal
all
these
it
brings
to
the
test
of
their
true
self
through
misfortune
some
also
have
bought
a
name
revered
to
future
ages
at
the
price
of
a
glorious
death
some
by
invincible
constancy
under
their
sufferings
have
afforded
an
example
to
others
that
virtue
can
not
be
overcome
by
calamity
all
which
things
without
doubt
come
to
pass
rightly
and
in
due
order
and
to
the
benefit
of
those
to
whom
they
are
seen
to
happen
to
the
other
side
of
the
marvel
that
the
bad
now
meet
with
affliction
now
get
their
hearts
desire
this
too
springs
from
the
same
causes
as
to
the
afflictions
of
course
no
one
marvels
because
all
hold
the
wicked
to
be
ill
deserving
the
truth
is
their
punishments
both
frighten
others
from
crime
and
amend
those
on
whom
they
are
inflicted
while
their
prosperity
is
a
powerful
sermon
to
the
good
what
judgments
they
ought
to
pass
on
good
fortune
of
this
kind
which
often
attends
the
wicked
so
assiduously
is
another
object
which
may
i
believe
be
attained
in
such
cases
there
is
one
perhaps
whose
nature
is
so
reckless
and
violent
that
poverty
would
drive
him
more
desperately
into
crime
disorder
providence
relieves
by
allowing
him
to
amass
money
such
a
one
in
the
uneasiness
of
a
conscience
stained
with
guilt
while
he
contrasts
his
character
with
his
fortune
perchance
grows
alarmed
lest
he
should
come
to
mourn
the
loss
of
that
whose
possession
is
so
pleasant
to
him
he
will
then
reform
his
ways
and
through
the
fear
of
losing
his
fortune
he
forsakes
his
iniquity
some
through
a
prosperity
unworthily
borne
have
been
hurled
headlong
to
ruin
to
some
the
power
of
the
sword
has
been
committed
to
the
end
that
the
good
may
be
tried
by
discipline
and
the
bad
punished
for
while
there
can
be
no
peace
between
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
neither
can
the
wicked
agree
among
themselves
how
should
they
when
each
is
at
variance
with
himself
because
his
vices
rend
his
conscience
and
ofttimes
they
do
things
which
when
they
are
done
they
judge
ought
not
to
have
been
done
hence
it
is
that
this
supreme
providence
brings
to
pass
this
notable
marvel
that
the
bad
make
the
bad
good
for
some
when
they
see
the
injustice
which
they
themselves
suffer
at
the
hands
of

inflamed
with
detestation
of
the
offenders
and
in
the
endeavour
to
be
unlike
those
whom
they
hate
return
to
the
ways
of
virtue
it
is
the
divine
power
alone
to
which
things
evil
are
also
good
in
that
by
putting
them
to
suitable
use
it
bringeth
them

some
good

evil
from

necessity
whereby
it
comes
to

can
that
be

alike
has
for
its
object
the
reward
or
trial
of
the

the

of
the

every
fortune
must
be
good

it
is

so
long
as
i
reflect
upon
the
providence
and
fate
of
which
thou
hast
taught
me
based
on
a
strong
foundation
yet
with
thy
leave
we
will
count
it
among
those
which
just
now
thou
didst
set
down
as
paradoxical
why
so
said
she
ordinary
speech
is
apt
to
assert
and
that
frequently
that
some
men
fortune
is
bad
we
then
for
awhile
approach
more
nearly
to
the
language
of
the
vulgar
that
we
may
not
seem
to
have
departed
too
far
from
the
usages
of
men
thy
good
pleasure
said
i
which
advantageth
thou
callest
good
dost
thou
not
that
which
either
tries
or
amends
advantageth
good
then
course
this
is
case
who
have
attained
virtue
and
wage
war
with
adversity
or
turn
from
vice
and
lay
hold
on
the
path
of
virtue
can
not
deny
it
of
the
good
fortune
which
is
given
as
reward
of
the
good
do
the
vulgar
adjudge
it
bad
but
that
they
deem
it
to
be
the
best
as
indeed
it
is
then
of
that
which
remains
which
though
it
is
harsh
puts
the
restraint
of
just
punishment
on
the
bad
does
popular
opinion
deem
it
good
of
all
that
can
be
imagined
it
is
accounted
the
most
miserable
then
if
in
following
popular
opinion
we
have
not
ended
in
a
conclusion
quite
paradoxical
so
said
i
it
results
from
our
admissions
that
of
all
who
have
attained
or
are
advancing
in
or
are
aiming
at
virtue
the
fortune
is
in
every
case
good
while
for
those
who
remain
in
their
wickedness
fortune
is
always
utterly
bad
is
true
said
i
no
one
dare
acknowledge
it
said
she
wise
man
ought
not
to
take
it
ill
if
ever
he
is
involved
in

it
becomes
a
brave

to
be
offended

at

the

the
time
of
trial
is
the
express
opportunity
for
the
one
to
win
glory
for
the
other
to
perfect
his
wisdom
hence
indeed
virtue
gets
its
name
because
relying
on
its
own
efficacy
it
yieldeth
not
to
adversity
and
ye
who
have
taken
your
stand
on

for
you

that

what

perplexity
arises
from
our
viewing

from

we
must
try
and
rise
to
the
higher
standpoint
of

ch

to
understand
this
higher
form
of

we
must
consider

god
is

eternity
is
more
than
mere
everlasting
duration
accordingly
his
knowledge
surveys
past
and
future
in
the
timelessness
of
an
eternal
present
his
foreseeing
is
seeing
yet
this
foreseeing
does
not
in
itself
impose
necessity
any
more
than
our
seeing
things
happen
makes
their
happening

we
may
however
if
we
please
distinguish
two
necessities
one
absolute
the
other
conditional
on

in
this
conditional
sense
alone
do
the
things
which
god
foresees
necessarily
come
to
pass

this
kind
of

affects
not
the
nature

leaves

defined
as
a

movement
without

of

connection
i
roundly
affirm
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
chance
at
all
and
consider
the
word
to
be
altogether
without
meaning
except
as
a
symbol
of
the
thing
designated
what
place
can
be
left
for
random
action
when
god
constraineth
all
things
to
order
for
ex
nihilo
nihil
is
sound
doctrine
which
none
of
the
ancients
gainsaid
although
they
used
it
of
material
substance
not
of
the
efficient
principle
this
they
laid
down
as
a
kind
of
basis
for
all
their
reasonings
concerning
nature
now
if
a
thing
arise
without
causes
it
will
appear
to
have
arisen
from
nothing
but
if
this
can
not
be
neither
is
it
possible
for
there
to
be
chance
in
accordance
with
the
definition
just
given
said
i
there
then
nothing
which
can
properly
be
called
chance
or
accident
or
is
there
something
to
which
these
names
are
appropriate
though
its
nature
is
dark
to
the
vulgar
good
aristotle
says
she
defined
it
concisely
in
his
physics
and
closely
in
accordance
with
the
truth
pray
said
i
says
she
something
is
done
for
the
sake
of
a
particular
end
and
for
certain
reasons
some
other
result
than
that
designed
ensues
this
is
called
chance
for
instance
if
a
man
is
digging
the
earth
for
tillage
and
finds
a
mass
of
buried
gold
now
such
a
find
is
regarded
as
accidental
yet
it
is
not
ex
nihilo
for
it
has
its
proper
causes
the
unforeseen
and
unexpected
concurrence
of
which
has
brought
the
chance
about
for
had
not
the
cultivator
been
digging
had
not
the
man
who
hid
the
money
buried
it
in
that
precise
spot
the
gold
would
not
have
been
found
these
then
are
the
reasons
why
the
find
is
a
chance
one
in
that
it
results
from
causes
which
met
together
and
concurred
not
from
any
intention
on
the
part
of
the
discoverer
since
neither
he
who
buried
the
gold
nor
he
who
worked
in
the
field
that
the
money
should
be
found
but
as
i
said
it
by
coincidence
that
one
dug
where
the
other
buried
the
treasure
we
may
then
define
chance
as
being
an
unexpected
result
flowing
from
a
concurrence
of
causes
where
the
several
factors
had
some
definite
end
but
the
meeting
and
concurrence
of
these
causes
arises
from
that
inevitable
chain
of
order
which
flowing
from
the
of
providence
disposes
all
things
in
their
due
time

place

ii
am
following
needfully
said
i
i
agree
that
it
is
as
thou
sayest
but
in
this
series
of
linked
causes
is
there
any
freedom
left
to
our
will
or
does
the
chain
of
fate
bind
also
the
very
motions
of
our
souls
is
freedom
said
she
indeed
can
any
creature
be
rational
unless
he
be
endowed
with
free
will
for
that
which
hath
the
natural
use
of
reason
has
the
faculty
of
discriminative
judgment
and
of
itself
distinguishes
what
is
to
be
shunned
or
desired
now
everyone
seeks
what
he
judges
desirable
and
avoids
what
he
thinks
should
be
shunned
wherefore
beings
endowed
with
reason
possess
also
the
faculty
of
free
choice
and
refusal
but
i
suppose
this
faculty
not
equal
alike
in
all
the
higher
divine
essences
possess
a
judgment
an
uncorrupt
will
and
an
effective
power
of
accomplishing
their
wishes
human
souls
must
needs
be
comparatively
free
while
they
abide
in
the
contemplation
of
the
divine
mind
less
free
when
they
pass
into
bodily
form
and
still
less
again
when
they
are
enwrapped
in
earthly
members
but
when
they
are
given
over
to
vices
and
fall
from
the
possession
of
their
proper
reason
then
indeed
their
condition
is
utter
slavery
for
when
they
let
their
gaze
fall
from
the
light
of
highest
truth
to
the
lower
world
where
darkness
reigns
soon
ignorance
blinds
their
vision
they
are
disturbed
by
baneful
affections
by
yielding
and
assenting
to
which
they
help
to
promote
the
slavery
in
which
they
are
involved
and
are
in
a
manner
led
captive
by
reason
of
their
very
liberty

who
seeth
all

from

then
said
i
now
i
am
once
more
perplexed
by
a
problem
yet
more
difficult
what
is
that
said
she
in
truth
i
can
guess
what
it
is
that
troubles
you
seems
said
i
much
of
a
paradox
and
a
contradiction
that
god
should
know
all
things
and
yet
there
should
be
free
will
for
if
god
foresees
everything
and
can
in
no
wise
be
deceived
that
which
providence
foresees
to
be
about
to
happen
must
necessarily
come
to
pass
wherefore
if
from
eternity
he
foreknows
not
only
what
men
will
do
but
also
their
designs
and
purposes
there
can
be
no
freedom
of
the
will
seeing
that
nothing
can
be
done
nor
can
any
sort
of
purpose
be
entertained
save
such
as
a
divine
providence
incapable
of
being
deceived
has
perceived
beforehand
for
if
the
issues
can
be
turned
aside
to
some
other
end
than
that
foreseen
by
providence
there
will
not
then
be
any
sure
foreknowledge
of
the
future
but
uncertain
conjecture
instead
and
to
think
this
of
god
i
deem
impiety
i
do
not
approve
the
reasoning
by
which
some
think
to
solve
this
puzzle
for
they
say
that
it
is
not
because
god
has
foreseen
the
coming
of
an
event
that
it
is
sure
to
come
to
pass
but
conversely
because
something
is
about
to
come
to
pass
it
can
not
be
hidden
from
divine
providence
and
accordingly
the
necessity
passes
to
the
opposite
side
and
it
is
not
that
what
is
foreseen
must
necessarily
come
to
pass
but
that
what
is
about
to
come
to
pass
must
necessarily
be
foreseen
but
this
is
just
as
if
the
matter
in
debate
were
which
is
cause
and
which
effect
whether
foreknowledge
of
the
future
cause
of
the
necessity
or
the
necessity
of
the
future
of
the
foreknowledge
but
we
need
not
be
at
the
pains
of
demonstrating
that
whatsoever
be
the
order
of
the
causal
sequence
the
occurrence
of
things
foreseen
is
necessary
even
though
the
foreknowledge
of
future
events
does
not
in
itself
impose
upon
them
the
necessity
of
their
occurrence
for
example
if
a
man
be
seated
the
supposition
of
his
being
seated
is
necessarily
true
and
conversely
if
the
supposition
of
his
being
seated
is
true
because
he
is
really
seated
he
must
necessarily
be
sitting
so
in
either
case
there
is
some
necessity
involved
in
this
latter
case
the
necessity
of
the
fact
in
the
former
of
the
truth
of
the
statement
but
in
both
cases
the
sitter
is
not
therefore
seated
because
the
opinion
is
true
but
rather
the
opinion
is
true
because
antecedently
he
was
sitting
as
a
matter
of
fact
thus
though
the
cause
of
the
truth
of
the
opinion
comes
from
the
other
side
p
yet
there
is
a
necessity
on
both
sides
alike
we
can
obviously
reason
similarly
in
the
case
of
providence
and
the
future
even
if
future
events
are
foreseen
because
they
are
about
to
happen
and
do
not
come
to
pass
because
they
are
foreseen
still
all
the
same
there
is
a
necessity
both
that
they
should
be
foreseen
by
god
as
about
to
come
to
pass
and
that
when
they
are
foreseen
they
should
happen
and
this
is
sufficient
for
the
destruction
of
free
will
however
it
is
preposterous
to
speak
of
the
occurrence
of
events
in
time
as
the
cause
of
eternal
foreknowledge
and
yet
if
we
believe
that
god
foresees
future
events
because
they
are
about
to
come
to
pass
what
is
it
but
to
think
that
the
occurrence
of
events
is
the
cause
of
his
supreme
providence
further
just
as
when
i
that
anything
is
that
thing
is
so
when
i
know
that
anything
will
be
it
will
be
it
follows
then
that
things
foreknown
come
to
pass
inevitably
to
think
of
a
thing
as
being
in
any
way
other
than
what
it
is
is
not
only
not
knowledge
but
it
is
false
opinion
widely
different
from
the
truth
of
knowledge
consequently
if
anything
is
about
to
be
and
yet
its
occurrence
is
not
certain
and
necessary
how
can
anyone
foreknow
that
it
will
occur
for
just
as
knowledge
itself
is
free
from
all
admixture
of
falsity
so
any
conception
drawn
from
knowledge
can
not
be
other
than
as
it
is
conceived
for
this
indeed
is
the
cause
why
knowledge
is
free
from
falsehood
because
of
necessity
each
thing
must
correspond
exactly
with
the
knowledge
which
grasps
its
nature
in
what
way
then
are
we
to
suppose
that
god
foreknows
these
uncertainties
as
about
to
come
to
pass
for
if
he
thinks
of
events
which
possibly
may
not
happen
at
all
as
inevitably
destined
to
come
to
pass
he
is
deceived
and
this
it
is
not
only
impious
to
believe
but
even
so
much
as
to
express
in
words
if
on
the
other
hand
he
sees
them
in
the
future
as
they
are
in
such
a
sense
as
to
know
that
they
may
equally
come
to
pass
or
not
what
sort
of
foreknowledge
is
this
which
comprehends
nothing
certain
nor
fixed
what
better
is
this
than
the
absurd
vaticination
of
teiresias
i
say
shall
either
come
to
pass
or
not
in
that
case
too
in
what
would
divine
providence
surpass
human
opinion
if
it
holds
for
uncertain
things
the
occurrence
of
which
is
uncertain
even
as
men
do
but
if
at
that
perfectly
sure
of
all
things
no
shadow
of
uncertainty
can
possibly
be
found
then
the
occurrence
of
those
things
which
he
has
surely
foreknown
as
coming
is
certain
wherefore
there
can
be
no
freedom
in
human
actions
and
designs
but
the
divine
mind
which
foresees
all
things
without
possibility
of
mistake
ties
and
binds
them
down
to
one
only
issue
but
this
admission
once
made
what
an
upset
of
human
affairs
manifestly
ensues
vainly
are
rewards
and
punishments
proposed
for
the
good
and
bad
since
no
free
and
voluntary
motion
of
the
will
has
deserved
either
one
or
the
other
nay
the
punishment
of
the
wicked
and
the
reward
of
the
righteous
which
is
now
esteemed
the
perfection
of
justice
will
seem
the
most
flagrant
injustice
since
men
are
determined
either
way
not
by
their
own
proper
volition
but
by
the
necessity
of
what
must
surely
be
and
therefore
neither
virtue
nor
vice
is
anything
but
rather
good
and
ill
desert
are
confounded
together
without
distinction
moreover
seeing
that
the
whole
course
of
events
is
deduced
from
providence
and
nothing
is
left
free
to
human
design
it
comes
to
pass
that
our
vices
also
are
referred
to
the
author
of
all
good
a
thought
than
which
none
more
abominable
can
possibly
be
conceived
again
no
ground
is
left
for
hope
or
prayer
since
how
can
we
hope
for
blessings
or
pray
for
mercy
when
every
object
of
desire
depends
upon
the
links
of
an
unalterable

it
be

that
we
ever
earn
the
inestimable
recompense
of
the
divine
favour
at
the
price
of
a
due
humility
for
this
is
the
one
way
whereby
men
seem
able
to
hold
communion
with
god
and
are
joined
to
that
unapproachable
light
by
the
very

can
not
cope
with
the
simplicity
of
the
divine
foreknowledge
for
if
a
conception
of
its
nature
could
in
any
wise
be
framed
no
shadow
of
uncertainty
would
remain
with
a
view
of
making
this
at
last
clear
and
plain
i
will
begin
by
considering
the
arguments
by
which
thou
art
swayed
first
i
inquire
into
the
reasons
why
thou
art
dissatisfied
with
the
solution
proposed
which
is
to
the
effect
that
seeing
the
fact
of
foreknowledge
is
not
thought
the
cause
of
the
necessity
of
future
events
foreknowledge
is
not
to
be
deemed
any
hindrance
to
the
freedom
of
the
will
now
surely
the
sole
ground
on
which
thou
arguest
the
necessity
of
the
future
is
that
things
which
are
foreknown
can
not
fail
to
come
to
pass
but
if
as
thou
wert
ready
to
acknowledge
just
now
the
fact
of
foreknowledge
imposes
no
necessity
on
things
future
what
reason
is
there
for
supposing
the
results
of
voluntary
action
constrained
to
a
fixed
issue
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
and
to
see
what
follows
we
assume
that
there
is
no
foreknowledge
are
willed
actions
then
tied
down
to
any
necessity
in
case
not
us
assume
foreknowledge
again
but
without
its
involving
any
actual
necessity
the
freedom
of
the
will
i
imagine
will
remain
in
complete
integrity
but
thou
wilt
say
that
even
although
the
foreknowledge
is
not
the
necessity
of
the
future
event
occurrence
yet
it
is
a
sign
that
it
will
necessarily
happen
granted
but
in
this
case
it
is
plain
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
foreknowledge
the
issues
would
have
been
inevitably
certain
for
a
sign
only
indicates
something
which
is
does
not
bring
to
pass
that
of
which
it
is
the
sign
we
require
to
show
beforehand
that
all
things
without
exception
happen
of
necessity
in
order
that
a
preconception
may
be
a
sign
of
this
necessity
otherwise
if
there
is
no
such
universal
necessity
neither
can
any
preconception
be
a
sign
of
a
necessity
which
exists
not
manifestly
too
a
proof
established
on
firm
grounds
of
reason
must
be
drawn
not
from
signs
and
loose
general
arguments
but
from
suitable
and
necessary
causes
but
how
can
it
be
that
things
foreseen
should
ever
fail
to
come
to
pass
why
this
is
to
suppose
us
to
believe
that
the
events
which
providence
foresees
to
be
coming
were
not
about
to
happen
instead
of
our
supposing
that
although
they
should
come
to
pass
yet
there
was
no
necessity
involved
in
their
own
nature
compelling
their
occurrence
take
an
illustration
that
will
help
to
convey
my
meaning
there
are
many
things
which
we
see
taking
place
before
our
eyes
the
movements
of
charioteers
for
instance
in
guiding
and
turning
their
cars
and
so
on
now
is
any
one
of
these
movements
compelled
by
any
necessity
certainly
not
there
would
be
no
efficacy
in
skill
if
all
motions
took
place
perforce
things
which
in
taking
place
are
free
from
any
necessity
as
to
their
being
in
the
present
must
also
before
they
take
place
be
about
to
happen
without
necessity
wherefore
there
are
things
which
will
come
to
pass
the
occurrence
of
which
is
perfectly
free
from
necessity
at
all
events
i
imagine
that
no
one
will
deny
that
things
now
taking
place
were
about
to
come
to
pass
before
they
were
actually
happening
such
things
however
much
foreknown
are
in
their
occurrence
for
even
as
knowledge
of
things
present
imports
no
necessity
into
things
that
are
taking
place
so
foreknowledge
of
the
future
imports
none
into
things
that
are
about
to
come
but
this
thou
wilt
say
is
the
very
point
in
dispute
whether
any
foreknowing
is
possible
of
things
whose
occurrence
is
not
necessary
for
here
there
seems
to
thee
a
contradiction
and
if
they
are
foreseen
their
necessity
follows
whereas
if
there
is
no
necessity
they
can
by
no
means
be
foreknown
and
thou
thinkest
that
nothing
can
be
grasped
as
known
unless
it
is
certain
but
if
things
whose
occurrence
is
uncertain
are
foreknown
as
certain
this
is
the
very
mist
of
opinion
not
the
truth
of
knowledge
for
to
think
of
things
otherwise
than
as
they
are
thou
believest
to
be
incompatible
with
the
soundness
of
knowledge
the
cause
of
the
mistake
is
this
that
men
think
that
all
knowledge
is
cognized
purely
by
the
nature
and
efficacy
of
the
thing
known
whereas
the
case
is
the
very
reverse
all
that
is
known
is
grasped
not
conformably
to
its
own
efficacy
but
rather
conformably
to
the
faculty
of
the
knower
an
example
will
make
this
clear
the
roundness
of
a
body
is
recognised
in
one
way
by
sight
in
another
by
touch
sight
looks
upon
it
from
a
distance
as
a
whole
by
a
simultaneous
reflection
of
rays
touch
grasps
the
roundness
piecemeal
by
contact
and
attachment
to
the
surface
and
by
actual
movement
round
the
periphery
itself
man
himself
likewise
is
viewed
in
one
way
by
sense
in
another
by
imagination
in
another
way
again
by
thought
in
another
by
pure
intelligence
sense
judges
figure
clothed
in
material
substance
imagination
figure
alone
without
matter
thought
transcends
this
again
and
by
its
contemplation
of
universals
considers
the
type
itself
which
is
contained
in
the
individual
the
eye
of
intelligence
is
yet
more
exalted
for
overpassing
the
sphere
of
the
universal
it
will
behold
absolute
form
itself
by
the
pure
force
of
the
mind
vision
wherein
the
main
point
to
be
considered
is
this
the
higher
faculty
of
comprehension
embraces
the
lower
while
the
lower
can
not
rise
to
the
higher
for
sense
has
no
efficacy
beyond
matter
nor
can
imagination
behold
universal
ideas
nor
thought
embrace
pure
form
but
intelligence
looking
down
as
it
were
from
its
higher
standpoint
in
its
intuition
of
form
discriminates
also
the
several
elements
which
underlie
it
but
it
comprehends
them
in
the
same
way
as
it
comprehends
that
form
itself
which
could
be
cognized
by
no
other
than
itself
for
it
cognizes
the
universal
of
thought
the
figure
of
imagination
and
the
matter
of
sense
without
employing
thought
imagination
or
sense
but
surveying
all
things
so
to
speak
under
the
aspect
of
pure
form
by
a
single
flash
of
intuition
thought
also
in
considering
the
universal
embraces
images
and
without
resorting
to
imagination
or
sense
for
it
is
thought
which
has
thus
defined
the
universal
from
its
conceptual
point
of
view
man
is
a
animal
endowed
with
reason
this
is
indeed
a
universal
notion
yet
no
one
is
ignorant
that
the
is
imaginable
and
presentable
to
sense
because
thought
considers
it
not
by
imagination
or
sense
but
by
means
of
rational
conception
imagination
too
though
its
faculty
of
viewing
and
forming
representations
is
founded
upon
the
senses
nevertheless
surveys
without
calling
in
sense
not
in
the
way
of
but
of
imagination
thou
then
how
all
things
in
cognizing
use
rather
their
own
faculty
than
the
faculty
of
the
things
which
they
cognize
nor
is
this
strange
for
since
every
judgment
is
the
act
of
the
judge
it
is
necessary
that
each
should
accomplish
its
task
by
its
own
not
by
another
power

although
in
the
case
of
bodies
endowed
with
sentiency
the
qualities
of
external
objects
affect
the
and
the
activity
of
mind
is
preceded
by
a
bodily
affection
which
calls
forth
the
action
upon
itself
and
stimulates
the
forms
till
that

i
say
if
in
these

the
mind
is
not
inscribed
by
mere
passive
affection
but
of
its
own
efficacy
discriminates
the
impressions
furnished
to
the
body
how
much
more
do
intelligences
free
from
all
bodily
affections
employ
in
their
discrimination
their
own
mental
activities
instead
of
conforming
to
external
objects
so
on
these
principles
various
modes
of
cognition
belong
to
distinct
and
different
substances
for
to
creatures
void
of
motive
power
and
other
such
creatures
which
cling
to
rocks

of
gaining
knowledge

whom
some
capacity
of
seeking
and
shunning
seems
to
have
arisen
imagination
also
thought
pertains
only
to
the
human
race
as
intelligence
to
divinity
alone
hence
it
follows
that
that
form
of
knowledge
exceeds
the
rest
which
of
its
own
nature
cognizes
not
only
its
proper
object
but
the
objects
of
the
other
forms
of
knowledge
also
but
what
if
sense
and
imagination
were
to
gainsay
thought
and
declare
that
universal
which
thought
deems
itself
to
behold
to
be
nothing
for
the
object
of
sense
and
imagination
can
not
be
universal
so
that
either
the
judgment
of
reason
is
true
and
there
is
no
or
since
they
know
full
well
that
many
objects
are
presented
to
sense
and
imagination
the
conception
of
reason
which
looks
on
that
which
is
perceived
by
sense
and
particular
as
if
it
were
a
something
universal
is
empty
of
content
suppose
further
that
reason
maintains
in
reply
that
it
does
indeed
contemplate
the
object
of
both
sense
and
imagination
under
the
form
of
universality
while
sense
and
imagination
can
not
aspire
to
the
knowledge
of
the
universal
since
their
cognizance
can
not
go
beyond
bodily
figures
and
that
in
the
cognition
of
reality
we
ought
rather
to
trust
the
stronger
and
more
perfect
faculty
of
judgment
in
a
dispute
of
this
sort
should
not
we
in
whom
is
planted
the
faculty
of
reasoning
as
well
as
of
imagining
and
perceiving
espouse
the
cause
of
reason

manner
is
it
that
human
reason
thinks
that
divine
intelligence
can
not
see
the
future
except
after
the
fashion
in
which
its
own
knowledge
is
obtained
for
thy
contention
is
if
events
do
not
appear
to
involve
certain
and
necessary
issues
they
can
not
be
foreseen
as
certainly
about
to
come
to
pass
there
is
then
no
foreknowledge
of
such
events
or
if
we
can
ever
bring
ourselves
to
believe
that
there
is
there
can
be
nothing
which
does
not
happen
of
necessity
if
however
we
could
have
some
part
in
the
judgment
of
the
divine
mind
even
as
we
participate
in
reason
we
should
think
it
perfectly
just
that
human
reason
should
submit
itself
to
the
divine
mind
no
less
than
we
judged
that
imagination
and
sense
ought
to
yield
to
reason
wherefore
let
us
soar
if
we
can
to
the
heights
of
that
supreme
intelligence
for
there
reason
will
see
what
in
itself
it
can
not
look
upon
and
that
is
in
what
way
things
whose
occurrence
is
not
certain
may
yet
be
seen
in
a
sure
and
definite
foreknowledge
and
that
this
foreknowledge
is

then
as
we
lately
proved
everything

nature

character

that
we
may
be
able
to
understand
also
the
nature
of
its
knowledge
is
eternal
in
this
judgment
all
rational
beings
agree
let
us
then
consider
what
eternity
is
for
this
word
carries
with
it
a
revelation
alike
of
the
divine
nature
and
of
the
divine
knowledge
now
eternity
is
the
possession
of
endless
life
whole
and
perfect
at
a
single
moment
what
this
is
becomes
more
clear
and
manifest
from
a
comparison
with
things
temporal
for
whatever
lives
in
time
is
a
present
proceeding
from
the
past
to
the
future
and
there
is
nothing
set
in
time
which
can
embrace
the
whole
space
of
its
life
together
state
it
grasps
not
yet
while
it
has
already
lost
yesterday
nay
even
in
the
life
of
ye
live
no
longer
than
one
brief
transitory
moment
whatever
therefore
is
subject
to
the
condition
of
time
although
as
aristotle
deemed
of
the
world
it
never
have
either
beginning
or
end
and
its
life
be
stretched
to
the
whole
extent
of
time
infinity
it
yet
is
not
such
as
rightly
to
be
thought
eternal
for
it
does
not
include
and
embrace
the
whole
space
of
infinite
life
at
once
but
has
no
present
hold
on
things
to
come
not
yet
accomplished
accordingly
that
which
includes
and
possesses
the
whole
fulness
of
unending
life
at
once
from
which
nothing
future
is
absent
from
which
nothing
past
has
escaped
this
is
rightly
called
eternal
this
must
of
necessity
be
ever
present
to
itself
in
full
and
hold
the
infinity
of
movable
time
in
an
abiding
present
wherefore
they
deem
not
rightly
who
imagine
that
on
plato
principles
the
created
world
is
made
with
the
creator
because
they
are
told
that
he
believed
the
world
to
have
had
no
beginning
in
time
s
and
to
be
destined
never
to
come
to
an
end
for
it
is
one
thing
for
existence
to
be
endlessly
prolonged
which
was
what
plato
ascribed
to
the
world
another
for
the
whole
of
an
endless
life
to
be
embraced
in
the
present
which
is
manifestly
a
property
peculiar
to
the
divine
mind
nor
need
god
appear
earlier
in
mere
duration
of
time
to
created
things
but
only
prior
in
the
unique
simplicity
of
his
nature
for
the
infinite
progression
of
things
in
time
copies
this
immediate
existence
in
the
present
of
the
changeless
life
and
when
it
can
not
succeed
in
equalling
it
declines
from
movelessness
into
motion
and
falls
away
from
the
simplicity
of
a
perpetual
present
to
the
infinite
duration
of
the
future
and
the
past
and
since
it
can
not
possess
the
whole
fulness
of
its
life
together
for
the
very
reason
that
in
a
manner
it
never
ceases
to
be
it
seems
up
to
a
certain
point
to
rival
that
which
it
can
not
complete
and
express
by
attaching
itself
indifferently
to
any
present
moment
of
time
however
swift
and
brief
and
since
this
bears
some
resemblance
to
that
present
it
bestows
on
everything
to
which
it
is
assigned
the
semblance
of
existence
but
since
it
can
not
abide
it
hurries
along
the
infinite
path
of
time
and
the
result
has
been
that
it
continues
by
ceaseless
movement
the
life
the
completeness
of
which
it
could
not
embrace
while
it
stood
still
so
if
we
are
minded
to
give
things
their
right
names
we
shall
follow
plato
in
saying
that
god
indeed
is
eternal
but
the
world
everlasting
then
every
mode
of
judgment
comprehends
its
objects
conformably
to
its
own
nature
and
since
god
abides
for
ever
in
an
eternal
present
his
knowledge
also
transcending
all
movement
of
time
dwells
in
the
simplicity
of
its
own
changeless
present
and
embracing
the
whole
infinite
sweep
of
the
past
and
of
the
future
contemplates
all
that
falls
within
its
simple
cognition
as
if
it
were
now
taking
place
and
therefore
if
thou
wilt
carefully
consider
that
immediate
presentment
whereby
it
discriminates
all
things
thou
wilt
more
rightly
deem
it
not
foreknowledge
as
of
something
future
but
knowledge
of
a
moment
that
never
passes
for
this
cause
the
name
chosen
to
describe
it
is
not
prevision
but
providence
because
since
utterly
removed
in
nature
from
things
mean
and
trivial
its
outlook
embraces
all
things
as
from
some
lofty
height
why
then
dost
thou
insist
that
the
things
which
are
surveyed
by
the
divine
eye
are
involved
in
necessity
whereas
clearly
men
impose
no
necessity
on
things
which
they
see
does
the
act
of
vision
add
any
necessity
to
the
things
which
thou
seest
before
thy
eyes
not
yet
if
we
may
without
unfitness
compare
god
present
and
man
just
as
ye
see
certain
things
in
this
your
temporary
present
so
does
he
see
all
things
in
his
eternal
present
wherefore
this
divine
anticipation
changes
not
the
natures
and
properties
of
things
and
it
beholds
things
present
before
it
just
as
they
will
hereafter
come
to
pass
in
time
nor
does
it
confound
things
in
its
judgment
but
in
the
one
mental
view
distinguishes
alike
what
will
come
necessarily
and
what
without
necessity
for
even
as
ye
when
at
one
and
the
same
time
ye
see
a
man
walking
on
the
earth
and
the
sun
rising
in
the
sky
distinguish
between
the
two
though
one
glance
embraces
both
and
judge
the
former
voluntary
the
latter
necessary
action
so
also
the
divine
vision
in
its
universal
range
of
view
does
in
no
wise
confuse
the
characters
of
the
things
which
are
present
to
its
regard
though
future
in
respect
of
time
whence
it
follows
that
when
it
perceives
that
something
will
come
into
existence
and
yet
is
perfectly
aware
that
this
is
unbound
by
any
necessity
its
apprehension
is
not
opinion
but
rather
knowledge
based
on
truth
and
if
to
this
thou
sayest
that
what
god
sees
to
be
about
to
come
to
pass
can
not
fail
to
come
to
pass
and
that
what
can
not
fail
to
come
to
pass
happens
of
necessity
and
wilt
tie
me
down
to
this
word
necessity
i
will
acknowledge
that
thou
affirmest
a
most
solid
truth
but
one
which
scarcely
anyone
can
approach
to
who
has
not
made
the
divine
his
special
study
for
my
answer
would
be
that
the
same
future
event
is
necessary
from
the
standpoint
of
divine
knowledge
but
when
considered
in
its
own
nature
it
seems
absolutely
free
and
unfettered
so
then
there
are
two
necessities
one
simple
as
that
men
are
necessarily
mortal
the
other
conditioned
as
that
if
you
know
that
someone
is
walking
he
must
necessarily
be
walking
for
that
which
is
known
can
not
indeed
be
otherwise
than
as
it
is
known
to
be
and
yet
this
fact
by
no
means
carries
with
it
that
other
simple
necessity
for
the
former
necessity
is
not
imposed
by
the
thing
own
proper
nature
but
by
the
addition
of
a
condition
no
necessity
compels
one
who
is
voluntarily
walking
to
go
forward
although
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
go
forward
at
the
moment
of
walking
in
the
same
way
then
if
providence
sees
anything
as
present
that
must
necessarily
be
though
it
is
bound
by
no
necessity
of
nature
now
god
views
as
present
those
coming
events
which
happen
of
free
will
these
accordingly
from
the
standpoint
of
the
divine
vision
are
made
necessary
conditionally
on
the
divine
cognizance
viewed
however
in
themselves
they
desist
not
from
the
absolute
freedom
naturally
theirs
accordingly
without
doubt
all
things
will
come
to
pass
which
god
foreknows
as
about
to
happen
but
of
these
certain
proceed
of
free
will
and
though
these
happen
yet
by
the
fact
of
their
existence
they
do
not
lose
their
proper
nature
in
virtue
of
which
before
they
happened
it
was
really
possible
that
they
might
not
have
come
to
pass
difference
then
does
the
denial
of
necessity
make
since
through
their
being
conditioned
by
divine
knowledge
they
come
to
pass
as
if
they
were
in
all
respects
under
the
compulsion
of
necessity
this
difference
surely
which
we
saw
in
the
case
of
the
instances
i
formerly
took
the
sun
rising
and
the
man
walking
which
at
the
moment
of
their
occurrence
could
not
but
be
taking
place
and
yet
one
of
them
before
it
took
place
was
necessarily
obliged
to
be
while
the
other
was
not
so
at
all
so
likewise
the
things
which
to
god
are
present
without
doubt
exist
but
some
of
them
come
from
the
necessity
of
things
others
from
the
power
of
the
agent
quite
rightly
then
have
we
said
that
these
things
are
necessary
if
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
the
divine
knowledge
but
if
they
are
considered
in
themselves
they
are
free
from
the
bonds
of
necessity
even
as
everything
which
is
accessible
to
sense
regarded
from
the
standpoint
of
thought
is
universal
but
viewed
in
its
own
nature
particular
but
thou
wilt
say
if
it
is
in
my
power
to
change
my
purpose
i
shall
make
void
providence
since
i
shall
perchance
change
something
which
comes
within
its
foreknowledge
my
answer
is
thou
canst
indeed
turn
aside
thy
purpose
but
since
the
truth
of
providence
is
ever
at
hand
to
see
that
thou
canst
and
whether
thou
dost
and
whither
thou
turnest
thyself
thou
canst
not
avoid
the
divine
foreknowledge
even
as
thou
canst
not
escape
the
sight
of
a
present
spectator
although
of
thy
free
will
thou
turn
thyself
to
various
actions
wilt
thou
then
say
shall
the
divine
knowledge
be
changed
at
my
discretion
so
that
when
i
will
this
or
that
providence
changes
its
knowledge
correspondingly
not
for
the
divine
vision
anticipates
all
that
is
coming
and
transforms
and
reduces
it
to
the
form
of
its
own
present
knowledge
and
varies
not
as
thou
deemest
in
its
foreknowledge
alternating
to
this
or
that
but
in
a
single
flash
it
forestalls
and
includes
thy
mutations
without
altering
and
this
comprehension
and
survey
of
all
things
god
has
received
not
from
the
issue
of
future
events
but
from
the
simplicity
of
his
own
nature
hereby
also
is
resolved
the
objection
which
a
little
while
ago
gave
thee
offence
that
our
doings
in
the
future
were
spoken
of
as
if
supplying
the
cause
of
god
knowledge
for
this
faculty
of
knowledge
embracing
all
things
in
its
immediate
cognizance
has
itself
fixed
the
bounds
of
all
things
yet
itself
owes
nothing
to
what
comes
after
all
this
being
so
the
freedom
of
man
will
stands
unshaken
and
laws
are
not
unrighteous
since
their
rewards
and
punishments
are
held
forth
to
wills
unbound
by
any
necessity
god
who
foreknoweth
all
things
still
looks
down
from
above
and
the
eternity
of
his
vision
concurs
with
the
future
character
of
all
our
acts
and
dispenseth
to
the
good
rewards
to
the
bad
punishments
our
hopes
and
prayers
also
are
not
fixed
on
god
in
vain
and
when
they
are
rightly
directed
can
not
fail
of
effect
therefore
withstand
vice
practise
virtue
lift
up
your
souls
to
right
hopes
offer
humble
prayers
to
heaven
great
is
the
necessity
of
righteousness
laid
upon
you
if
ye
will
not
hide
it
from
yourselves
seeing
that
all
your
actions
are
done
before
the
eyes
of
a
judge

all
things
