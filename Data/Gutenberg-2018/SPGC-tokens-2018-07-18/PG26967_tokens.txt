june
introduction
by
sam
moskowitz
of
the
gravest
editorial
problems
faced
by
the
editors
of
amazing
stories
when
they
launched
its
first
issue
dated
april
was
the
problem
of
finding
or
developing
authors
who
could
write
the
type
of
story
they
needed
as
a
the
first
two
issues
of
amazing
stories
were
devoted
entirely
to
reprints
but
reprints
were
to
constitute
a
declining
portion
of
the
publication
contents
for
the
following
four
years
the
first
new
story
the
magazine
bought
was
of
the
by
peyton
wertenbaker
which
appeared
in
its
third
issue
wertenbaker
was
not
technically
a
newcomer
to
science
fiction
since
he
had
sold
his
first
story
to
gernsback
science
and
invention
man
from
the
in
when
he
was
only
now
at
the
ripe
old
age
of
he
was
appearing
in
the
world
first
truly
complete
science
fiction
scope
of
his
imagination
was
truly
impressive
and
despite
the
author
youth
of
the
builds
to
a
climax
of
considerable
under
the
name
of
green
peyton
went
on
to
sell
his
first
novel

eventually
became
an
authority
on
the
southwest
with
many
regional
volumes
to
his
credit
god
and
and
antonio
city
of
the
but
he
never
lost
his
interest
in
space
travel
assisting
hubertus
strughold
on
the
writing
of
green
and
red
a
scientific
appraisal
of
the
possibilities
of
life
on
the
planet
mars
published
in
he
also
served
for
a
time
as
london
correspondent
for
fortune
it
is
strange
to
be
alone
and
so
cold
to
be
the
last
man
on
earth
the
snow
drives
silently
about
me
ceaselessly
drearily
and
i
am
isolated
in
this
tiny
white
indistinguishable
corner
of
a
blurred
world
surely
the
loneliest
creature
in
the
universe
how
many
thousands
of
years
is
it
since
i
last
knew
the
true
companionship
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
lonely
but
there
were
people
creatures
of
flesh
and
blood
now
they
are
gone
now
i
have
not
even
the
stars
to
keep
me
company
for
they
are
all
lost
in
an
infinity
of
snow
and
twilight
here
below
if
only
i
could
know
how
long
it
has
been
since
first
i
was
imprisoned
upon
the
earth
it
can
not
matter
now
and
yet
some
vague
dissatisfaction
some
faint
instinct
asks
over
and
over
in
my
throbbing
ears
what
year
what
year
it
was
in
the
year
that
the
great
thing
began
in
my
life
there
was
then
a
very
great
man
who
performed
operations
on
his
fellows
to
compose
their
vitals
we
called
such
men
surgeons
john
granden
wore
the
title
sir
before
his
name
in
indication
of
nobility
by
birth
according
to
the
prevailing
standards
in
england
but
surgery
was
only
a
hobby
of
sir
john
if
i
must
be
precise
for
while
he
had
achieved
an
enormous
reputation
as
a
surgeon
he
always
felt
that
his
real
work
lay
in
the
experimental
end
of
his
profession
he
was
in
a
way
a
dreamer
but
a
dreamer
who
could
make
his
dreams
come
true
i
was
a
very
close
friend
of
sir
john
in
fact
we
shared
the
same
apartments
in
london
i
have
never
forgotten
that
day
when
he
first
mentioned
to
me
his
momentous
discovery
i
had
just
come
in
from
a
long
in
the
country
with
alice
and
i
was
seated
drowsily
in
the
writing
idly
in
my
mind
a
description
of
the
wind
and
the
snow
and
the
grey
twilight
of
the
evening
it
is
strange
is
it
not
that
my
tale
should
begin
and
end
with
the
snow
and
the
twilight
sir
john
opened
suddenly
a
door
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
came
hurrying
across
to
another
door
he
looked
at
me
grinning
rather
like
a
triumphant
maniac
it
coming
he
cried
without
pausing
i
almost
got
it
i
smiled
at
him
he
looked
very
ludicrous
at
that
moment
what
have
you
got
i
asked
good
lord
man
the
secret
the
secret
and
then
he
was
gone
again
the
door
closing
upon
his
victorious
cry
the
secret
i
was
of
course
amused
but
i
was
also
very
much
interested
i
knew
sir
john
well
enough
to
realize
that
however
amazing
his
appearance
might
be
there
would
be
nothing
absurd
about
his
secret
whatever
it
was
but
it
was
useless
to
speculate
i
could
only
hope
for
enlightenment
at
dinner
so
i
immersed
myself
in
one
of
the
volumes
from
his
fine
library
of
imagination
and
waited
i
think
the
book
was
one
of
wells
probably
the
sleeper
awakes
or
some
other
of
his
brilliant
fantasies
and
predictions
for
i
was
in
a
mood
conducive
to
belief
in
almost
anything
when
later
we
sat
down
together
across
the
table
i
only
wish
i
could
give
some
idea
of
the
atmosphere
that
permeated
our
apartments
the
reality
it
lent
to
whatever
was
vast
and
amazing
and
strange
you
could
then
whoever
you
are
understand
a
little
the
ease
with
which
i
accepted
sir
john
new
discovery
he
began
to
explain
it
to
me
at
once
as
though
he
could
keep
it
to
himself
no
longer
did
you
think
i
had
gone
mad
dennell
he
asked
i
quite
wonder
that
i
have
why
i
have
been
studying
for
many
years
for
most
of
my
life
on
this
problem
and
suddenly
i
have
solved
it
or
rather
i
am
afraid
i
have
solved
another
one
much
greater
tell
me
about
it
but
for
god
sake
do
be
technical
right
he
said
then
he
paused
dennell
it
it
will
change
everything
that
is
in
the
world
his
eyes
held
mine
suddenly
with
the
fatality
of
a
hypnotist
dennell
it
is
the
secret
of
eternal
life
he
said
good
lord
sir
john
i
cried
half
inclined
to
laugh
i
mean
it
he
said
you
know
i
have
spent
most
of
my
life
studying
the
processes
of
birth
trying
to
find
out
precisely
what
went
on
in
the
whole
history
of
conception
you
have
found
out
no
that
is
just
what
amuses
me
i
have
discovered
something
else
without
knowing
yet
what
causes
either
process
i
do
want
to
be
technical
and
i
know
very
little
of
what
actually
takes
place
myself
but
i
can
try
to
give
you
some
idea
of
it
it
is
thousands
perhaps
millions
of
years
since
sir
john
explained
to
me
what
little
i
understood
at
the
time
i
may
have
forgotten
yet
i
try
to
reproduce
what
i
can
of
his
theory
in
my
study
of
the
processes
of
birth
he
began
i
discovered
the
rudiments
of
an
action
which
takes
place
in
the
bodies
of
both
men
and
women
there
are
certain
properties
in
the
foods
we
eat
that
remain
in
the
body
for
the
reproduction
of
life
two
distinct
essences
so
to
speak
of
which
one
is
retained
by
the
woman
another
by
the
man
it
is
the
union
of
these
two
properties
that
of
course
creates
the
child
now
i
made
a
slight
mistake
one
day
in
experimenting
with
a
and
i
certain
organs
which
i
need
not
describe
so
that
i
thought
i
had
completely
messed
up
the
poor
abdomen
it
lived
however
and
i
laid
it
aside
it
was
some
years
later
that
i
happened
to
notice
it
again
it
had
not
given
birth
to
any
young
but
i
was
amazed
to
note
that
it
had
apparently
grown
no
older
it
seemed
precisely
in
the
same
state
of
growth
in
which
i
had
left
it
from
that
i
built
up
i
the
and
observed
it
carefully
i
need
not
detail
my
studies
but
in
the
end
i
found
that
my
had
in
reality
been
a
momentous
discovery
i
found
that
i
had
only
to
close
certain
organs
to
certain
ducts
and
to
open
certain
dormant
organs
and
the
whole
process
of
reproduction
was
changed
you
have
heard
of
course
that
our
bodies
are
continually
changing
hour
by
hour
minute
by
minute
so
that
every
few
years
we
have
been
literally
reborn
some
such
principle
as
this
seems
to
operate
in
reproduction
except
that
instead
of
the
old
body
being
replaced
by
the
new
and
in
its
form
approximately
the
new
body
is
created
apart
from
it
it
is
the
creation
of
children
that
causes
us
to
die
it
would
seem
because
if
this
activity
is
so
to
speak
dammed
up
or
turned
aside
into
new
channels
the
reproduction
operates
on
the
old
body
renewing
it
continually
it
is
very
obscure
and
very
absurd
is
it
not
but
the
most
absurd
part
of
it
is
that
it
is
true
whatever
the
true
explanation
may
be
the
fact
remains
that
the
operation
can
be
done
that
it
actually
prolongs
life
indefinitely
and
that
i
alone
know
the
secret
sir
john
told
me
a
very
great
deal
more
but
after
all
i
think
it
amounted
to
little
more
than
this
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
express
the
great
hold
his
discovery
took
upon
my
mind
the
moment
he
recounted
it
from
the
very
first
under
the
spell
of
his
personality
i
believed
and
i
knew
he
was
speaking
the
truth
and
it
opened
up
before
me
new
vistas
i
began
to
see
myself
become
suddenly
eternal
never
again
to
know
the
fear
of
death
i
could
see
myself
storing
up
century
after
century
an
amplitude
of
wisdom
and
experience
that
would
make
me
truly
a
god
sir
john
i
cried
long
before
he
was
finished
you
must
perform
that
operation
on
me
but
dennell
you
are
too
hasty
you
must
not
put
yourself
so
rashly
into
my
hands
you
have
perfected
the
operation
have
you
that
is
true
he
said
you
must
try
it
out
on
somebody
must
you
not
yes
of
course
and
yet
somehow
dennell
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
man
is
not
yet
prepared
for
such
a
vast
thing
there
are
sacrifices
one
must
give
up
love
and
all
sensual
pleasure
this
operation
not
only
takes
away
the
mere
fact
of
reproduction
but
it
deprives
one
of
all
the
things
that
go
with
sex
all
love
all
sense
of
beauty
all
feeling
for
poetry
and
the
arts
it
leaves
only
the
few
emotions
selfish
emotions
that
are
necessary
to
do
you
not
see
one
becomes
an
intellect
nothing
more
a
cold
apotheosis
of
reason
and
i
for
one
can
not
face
such
a
thing
calmly
but
sir
john
like
many
fears
it
is
largely
horrible
in
the
foresight
after
you
have
changed
your
nature
you
can
not
regret
it
what
you
are
would
be
as
horrible
an
idea
to
you
afterwards
as
the
thought
of
what
you
will
be
seems
now
true
true
i
know
it
but
it
is
hard
to
face
nevertheless
i
am
not
afraid
to
face
it
you
do
not
understand
it
dennell
i
am
afraid
and
i
wonder
whether
you
or
i
or
any
of
us
on
this
earth
are
ready
for
such
a
step
after
all
to
make
a
race
deathless
one
should
be
sure
it
is
a
perfect
race
sir
john
i
said
it
is
not
you
who
have
to
face
this
nor
any
one
else
in
the
world
till
you
are
ready
but
i
am
firmly
resolved
and
i
demand
it
of
you
as
my
friend
well
we
argued
much
further
but
in
the
end
i
won
sir
john
promised
to
perform
the
operation
three
days
later
but
do
you
perceive
now
what
i
had
forgotten
during
all
that
discussion
the
one
thing
i
had
thought
i
could
never
forget
so
long
as
i
lived
not
even
for
an
instant
it
was
my
love
for
alice
i
had
forgotten
that
i
can
not
write
here
all
the
infinity
of
emotions
i
experienced
later
when
with
alice
in
my
arms
it
suddenly
came
upon
me
what
i
had
done
ages
ago
i
have
forgotten
how
to
feel
i
could
name
now
a
thousand
feelings
i
used
to
have
but
i
can
no
longer
even
understand
them
for
only
the
heart
can
understand
the
heart
and
the
intellect
only
the
intellect
with
alice
in
my
arms
i
told
the
whole
story
it
was
she
who
with
her
quick
instinct
grasped
what
i
had
never
noticed
but
carl
she
cried
do
you
see
it
will
mean
that
we
can
never
be
married
and
for
the
first
time
i
understood
if
only
i
could
some
conception
of
that
love
i
have
always
known
since
the
last
shred
of
comprehension
slipped
from
me
that
i
lost
something
very
wonderful
when
i
lost
love
but
what
does
it
matter
i
lost
alice
too
and
i
could
not
have
known
love
again
without
her
we
were
very
sad
and
very
tragic
that
night
for
hours
and
hours
we
argued
the
question
over
but
i
felt
somewhat
that
i
was
inextricably
caught
in
my
fate
that
i
could
not
retreat
now
from
my
resolve
i
was
perhaps
very
but
i
felt
that
it
would
be
cowardice
to
back
out
now
but
it
was
alice
again
who
perceived
a
final
aspect
of
the
matter
carl
she
said
to
me
her
lips
very
close
to
mine
it
need
not
come
between
our
love
after
all
ours
would
be
a
poor
sort
of
love
if
it
were
not
more
of
the
mind
than
of
the
flesh
we
shall
remain
lovers
but
we
shall
forget
mere
carnal
desire
i
shall
submit
to
that
operation
too
and
i
could
not
shake
her
from
her
resolve
i
would
speak
of
danger
that
i
could
not
let
her
face
but
after
the
fashion
of
women
she
disarmed
me
with
the
accusation
that
i
did
not
love
her
that
i
did
not
want
her
love
that
i
was
trying
to
escape
from
love
what
answer
had
i
for
that
but
that
i
loved
her
and
would
do
anything
in
the
world
not
to
lose
her
i
have
wondered
sometimes
since
whether
we
might
have
known
the
love
of
the
mind
is
love
something
entirely
of
the
flesh
something
created
by
an
ironic
god
merely
to
propagate
his
race
or
can
there
be
love
without
emotion
love
without
passion
love
between
two
cold
intellects
i
do
not
know
i
did
not
ask
then
i
accepted
anything
that
would
make
our
way
more
easy
there
is
no
need
to
draw
out
the
tale
already
my
hand
wavers
and
my
time
grows
short
soon
there
will
be
no
more
of
me
no
more
of
my
tale
no
more
of
mankind
there
will
be
only
the
snow
and
the
ice
and
the
cold
three
days
later
i
entered
john
hospital
with
alice
on
my
arm
all
my
affairs
and
they
were
few
enough
were
in
order
i
had
insisted
that
alice
wait
until
i
had
come
safely
through
the
operation
before
she
submitted
to
it
i
had
been
carefully
starved
for
two
days
and
i
was
lost
in
an
unreal
world
of
white
walls
and
white
clothes
and
white
lights
drunk
with
my
dreams
of
the
future
when
i
was
wheeled
into
the
operating
room
on
the
long
hard
table
for
a
moment
it
shone
with
brilliant
distinctness
a
neat
methodical
white
chamber
tall
and
more
or
less
circular
then
i
was
beneath
the
glare
of
soft
white
lights
and
the
room
faded
into
a
misty
vagueness
from
which
little
steel
rays
flashed
and
quivered
from
silvery
cold
instruments
for
a
moment
our
hands
sir
john
and
mine
gripped
and
we
were
saying
for
a
little
while
in
the
way
men
say
these
things
then
i
felt
the
warm
touch
of
alice
lips
upon
mine
and
i
felt
sudden
painful
things
i
can
not
describe
that
i
could
not
have
described
then
for
a
moment
i
felt
that
i
must
rise
and
cry
out
that
i
could
not
do
it
but
the
feeling
passed
and
i
was
passive
something
was
pressed
about
my
mouth
and
nose
something
with
an
ethereal
smell
staring
eyes
swam
about
me
from
behind
their
white
masks
i
struggled
instinctively
but
in
vain
i
was
held
securely
infinitesimal
points
of
light
began
to
wave
back
and
forth
on
a
background
a
great
hollow
buzzing
echoed
in
my
head
my
head
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
all
throat
a
great
cavernous
empty
throat
in
which
sounds
and
lights
were
mingled
together
in
a
swift
rhythm
approaching
receding
eternally
then
i
think
there
were
dreams
but
i
have
forgotten
them
i
began
to
emerge
from
the
effect
of
the
ether
everything
was
dim
but
i
could
perceive
alice
beside
me
and
sir
john
bravely
done
sir
john
was
saying
and
alice
too
was
saying
something
but
i
can
not
remember
what
for
a
long
while
we
talked
i
speaking
the
nonsense
of
those
who
are
coming
out
from
under
ether
they
teasing
me
a
little
solemnly
but
after
a
little
while
i
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
were
about
to
leave
suddenly
god
knows
why
i
knew
that
they
must
not
leave
something
cried
in
the
back
of
my
head
that
they
stay
one
can
not
explain
these
things
except
by
after
events
i
began
to
press
them
to
remain
but
they
smiled
and
said
they
must
get
their
dinner
i
commanded
them
not
to
go
but
they
spoke
kindly
and
said
they
would
be
back
before
long
i
think
i
even
wept
a
little
like
a
child
but
sir
john
said
something
to
the
nurse
who
began
to
reason
with
me
firmly
and
then
they
were
gone
and
somehow
i
was
asleep
when
i
awoke
again
my
head
was
fairly
clear
but
there
was
an
abominable
reek
of
ether
all
about
me
the
moment
i
opened
my
eyes
i
felt
that
something
had
happened
i
asked
for
sir
john
and
for
alice
i
saw
a
swift
curious
look
that
i
could
not
interpret
come
over
the
face
of
the
nurse
then
she
was
calm
again
her
countenance
impassive
she
reassured
me
in
quick
meaningless
phrases
and
told
me
to
sleep
but
i
could
not
sleep
i
was
absolutely
sure
that
something
had
happened
to
them
to
my
friend
and
to
the
woman
i
loved
yet
all
my
insistence
profited
me
nothing
for
the
nurses
were
a
silent
lot
finally
i
think
they
must
have
given
me
a
sleeping
potion
of
some
sort
for
i
fell
asleep
again
for
two
endless
chaotic
days
i
saw
nothing
of
either
of
them
alice
or
sir
john
i
became
more
and
more
agitated
the
nurse
more
and
more
taciturn
she
would
only
say
that
they
had
gone
away
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
on
the
third
day
i
found
out
they
thought
i
was
asleep
the
night
nurse
had
just
come
in
to
relieve
the
other
has
he
been
asking
about
them
again
she
asked
yes
poor
fellow
i
have
hardly
managed
to
keep
him
quiet
we
will
have
to
keep
it
from
him
until
he
is
recovered
fully
there
was
a
long
pause
and
i
could
hardly
control
my
labored
breathing
how
sudden
it
was
one
of
them
said
to
be
killed
like
that
i
heard
no
more
for
i
leapt
suddenly
up
in
bed
crying
out
quick
for
god
sake
tell
me
what
has
happened
i
jumped
to
the
floor
and
seized
one
of
them
by
the
collar
she
was
horrified
i
shook
her
with
a
superhuman
strength
tell
me
i
shouted
tell
me
or
i
she
told
me
what
else
could
she
do
they
were
killed
in
an
accident
she
gasped
in
a
taxi
a
collision
the
strand
and
at
that
moment
a
crowd
of
nurses
and
attendants
arrived
called
by
the
other
frantic
woman
and
they
put
me
to
bed
again
i
have
no
memory
of
the
next
few
days
i
was
in
delirium
and
i
was
never
told
what
i
said
during
my
ravings
nor
can
i
express
the
feelings
i
was
saturated
with
when
at
last
i
regained
my
mind
again
between
my
old
emotions
and
any
attempt
to
put
them
into
words
or
even
to
remember
them
lies
always
that
insurmountable
wall
of
my
change
i
can
not
understand
what
i
must
have
felt
i
can
not
express
it
i
only
know
that
for
weeks
i
was
sunk
in
a
misery
beyond
any
misery
i
had
ever
imagined
before
the
only
two
friends
i
had
on
earth
were
gone
to
me
i
was
left
alone
and
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
see
before
me
all
these
endless
years
that
would
be
the
same
dull
lonely
yet
i
recovered
i
could
feel
each
day
the
growth
of
a
strange
new
vigor
in
my
limbs
a
vast
force
that
was
something
tangibly
expressive
to
eternal
life
slowly
my
anguish
began
to
die
after
a
week
more
i
began
to
understand
how
my
emotions
were
leaving
me
how
love
and
beauty
and
everything
of
which
poetry
was
made
how
all
this
was
going
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
at
first
i
would
look
at
the
golden
sunlight
and
the
blue
shadow
of
the
wind
and
i
would
say
god
how
beautiful
and
the
words
would
echo
meaninglessly
in
my
ears
or
i
would
remember
alice
face
that
face
i
had
once
loved
so
inextinguishably
and
i
would
weep
and
clutch
my
forehead
and
clench
my
fists
crying
o
god
how
can
i
live
without
her
yet
there
would
be
a
little
strange
fancy
in
my
head
at
the
same
moment
saying
who
is
this
alice
you
know
no
such
person
and
truly
i
would
wonder
whether
she
had
ever
existed
so
slowly
the
old
emotions
were
shed
away
from
me
and
i
began
to
joy
in
a
corresponding
growth
of
my
mental
perceptions
i
began
to
toy
idly
with
mathematical
formulae
i
had
forgotten
years
ago
in
the
same
fashion
that
a
poet
toys
with
a
word
and
its
shades
of
meaning
i
would
look
at
everything
with
new
seeing
eyes
new
perception
and
i
would
understand
things
i
had
never
understood
before
because
formerly
my
emotions
had
always
occupied
me
more
than
my
thoughts
and
so
the
weeks
went
by
until
one
day
i
was
well
what
after
all
is
the
use
of
this
chronicle
surely
there
will
never
be
men
to
read
it
i
have
heard
them
say
that
the
snow
will
never
go
i
will
be
buried
it
will
be
buried
with
me
and
it
will
be
the
end
of
us
both
yet
somehow
it
eases
my
weary
soul
a
little
to
write
need
i
say
that
i
lived
thereafter
many
thousands
of
thousands
of
years
until
this
day
i
can
not
detail
that
life
it
is
a
long
round
of
new
fantastic
impressions
coming
one
after
another
melting
into
each
other
in
looking
back
as
in
looking
back
upon
dreams
i
seem
to
recall
only
a
few
isolated
periods
clearly
and
it
seems
that
my
imagination
must
have
filled
in
the
swift
movement
between
episodes
i
think
now
of
necessity
in
terms
of
centuries
and
millenniums
rather
than
days
and
months
the
snow
blows
terribly
about
my
little
fire
and
i
know
it
will
soon
gather
courage
to
quench
us
both
years
passed
at
first
with
a
sort
of
clear
wonder
i
watched
things
that
took
place
everywhere
in
the
world
i
studied
the
other
students
were
much
amazed
to
see
me
a
man
of
thirty
odd
coming
back
to
college
but
judas
dennell
you
already
got
your
what
more
do
you
want
so
they
would
all
ask
me
and
i
would
reply
i
want
an
and
an
i
did
tell
them
that
i
wanted
degrees
in
law
too
and
in
biology
and
chemistry
in
architecture
and
engineering
in
psychology
and
philosophy
even
so
i
believe
they
thought
me
mad
but
poor
fools
i
would
think
they
can
hardly
realize
that
i
have
all
of
eternity
before
me
to
study
i
went
to
school
for
many
decades
i
would
pass
from
university
to
university
leisurely
gathering
all
the
fruits
of
every
subject
i
took
up
revelling
in
study
as
no
student
revelled
ever
before
there
was
no
need
of
hurry
in
my
life
no
fear
of
death
too
soon
there
was
a
magnificence
of
vigor
in
my
body
and
a
magnificence
of
vision
and
clarity
in
my
brain
i
felt
myself
a
i
had
only
to
go
on
storing
up
wisdom
until
the
day
should
come
when
all
knowledge
of
the
world
was
mine
and
then
i
could
command
the
world
i
had
no
need
for
hurry
o
vast
life
how
i
gloried
in
my
eternity
and
how
little
good
it
has
ever
done
me
by
the
irony
of
god
for
several
centuries
changing
my
name
and
passing
from
place
to
place
i
continued
my
studies
i
had
no
consciousness
of
monotony
for
to
the
intellect
monotony
can
not
exist
it
was
one
of
those
emotions
i
had
left
behind
one
day
however
in
the
year
a
great
discovery
was
made
by
a
man
called
zarentzov
it
had
to
do
with
the
curvature
of
space
quite
changing
the
conceptions
that
we
had
all
followed
since
einstein
i
had
long
ago
mastered
the
last
detail
of
einstein
theory
as
had
in
time
the
rest
of
the
world
i
threw
myself
immediately
into
the
study
of
this
new
conception
to
my
amazement
it
all
seemed
to
me
curiously
dim
and
elusive
i
could
not
quite
grasp
what
zarentzov
was
trying
to
formulate
why
i
cried
the
thing
is
a
monstrous
fraud
i
went
to
the
professor
of
physics
in
the
university
i
then
attended
and
i
told
him
it
was
a
fraud
a
huge
book
of
mere
nonsense
he
looked
at
me
rather
pityingly
i
am
afraid
modevski
he
said
addressing
me
by
the
name
i
was
at
the
time
using
i
am
afraid
you
do
not
understand
it
that
is
all
when
your
mind
has
broadened
you
will
you
should
apply
yourself
more
carefully
to
your
physics
but
that
angered
me
for
i
had
mastered
my
physics
before
he
was
ever
born
i
challenged
him
to
explain
the
theory
and
he
did
he
put
it
obviously
in
the
clearest
language
he
could
yet
i
understood
nothing
i
stared
at
him
dumbly
until
he
shook
his
head
impatiently
saying
that
it
was
useless
that
if
i
could
not
grasp
it
i
would
simply
have
to
keep
on
studying
i
was
stunned
i
wandered
away
in
a
daze
for
do
you
see
what
happened
during
all
those
years
i
had
studied
ceaselessly
and
my
mind
had
been
clear
and
quick
as
the
day
i
first
had
left
the
hospital
but
all
that
time
i
had
been
able
only
to
remain
what
i
was
an
extraordinarily
intelligent
man
of
the
twentieth
century
and
the
rest
of
the
race
had
been
progressing
it
had
been
swiftly
gathering
knowledge
and
power
and
ability
all
that
time
faster
and
faster
while
i
had
been
only
remaining
still
and
now
here
was
zarentzov
and
the
teachers
of
the
universities
and
probably
a
hundred
intelligent
men
who
had
all
outstripped
me
i
was
being
left
behind
and
that
is
what
happened
i
need
not
dilate
further
upon
it
by
the
end
of
that
century
i
had
been
left
behind
by
all
the
students
of
the
world
and
i
never
did
understand
zarentzov
other
men
came
with
other
theories
and
these
theories
were
accepted
by
the
world
but
i
could
not
understand
them
my
intellectual
life
was
at
an
end
i
had
nothing
more
to
understand
i
knew
everything
i
was
capable
of
knowing
and
thenceforth
i
could
only
play
wearily
with
the
old
ideas
many
things
happened
in
the
world
a
time
came
when
the
east
and
west
two
mighty
unified
hemispheres
rose
up
in
arms
the
civil
war
of
a
planet
i
recall
only
chaotic
visions
of
fire
and
thunder
and
hell
it
was
all
incomprehensible
to
me
like
a
bizarre
dream
things
happened
people
rushed
about
but
i
never
knew
what
they
were
doing
i
lurked
during
all
that
time
in
a
tiny
shuddering
hole
under
the
city
of
yokohama
and
by
a
miracle
i
survived
and
the
east
won
but
it
seems
to
have
mattered
little
who
did
win
for
all
the
world
had
become
in
all
except
its
few
remaining
prejudices
a
single
race
and
nothing
was
changed
when
it
was
all
rebuilt
again
under
a
single
government
i
saw
the
first
of
the
strange
creatures
who
appeared
among
us
in
the
year
men
who
were
later
known
to
be
from
the
planet
venus
but
they
were
repulsed
for
they
were
savages
compared
with
the
earthmen
although
they
were
about
equal
to
the
people
of
my
own
century
those
of
them
who
did
not
perish
of
the
cold
after
the
intense
warmth
of
their
world
and
those
who
were
not
killed
by
our
hands
those
few
returned
silently
home
again
and
i
have
always
regretted
that
i
had
not
the
courage
to
go
with
them
i
watched
a
time
when
the
world
reached
perfection
in
mechanics
when
men
could
accomplish
anything
with
a
touch
of
the
finger
strange
men
these
creatures
of
the
hundredth
century
men
with
huge
brains
and
tiny
shriveled
bodies
atrophied
limbs
and
slow
ponderous
movements
on
their
little
conveyances
it
was
i
with
my
ancient
compunctions
who
shuddered
when
at
last
they
put
to
death
all
the
perverts
the
criminals
and
the
insane
ridding
the
world
of
the
scum
for
which
they
had
no
more
need
it
was
then
that
i
was
forced
to
produce
my
tattered
old
papers
proving
my
identity
and
my
story
they
knew
it
was
true
in
some
strange
fashion
of
theirs
and
thereafter
i
was
kept
on
exhibition
as
an
archaic
survival
i
saw
the
world
made
immortal
through
the
new
invention
of
a
man
called
kathol
who
used
somewhat
the
same
method
legend
decreed
had
been
used
upon
me
i
observed
the
end
of
speech
of
all
perceptions
except
one
when
men
learned
to
communicate
directly
by
thought
and
to
receive
directly
into
the
brain
all
the
myriad
vibrations
of
the
universe
all
these
things
i
saw
and
more
until
that
time
when
there
was
no
more
discovery
but
a
perfect
world
in
which
there
was
no
need
for
anything
but
memory
men
ceased
to
count
time
at
last
several
hundred
years
after
the
dynasty
from
the
last
war
or
as
we
would
have
counted
in
my
time
about
official
records
of
time
were
no
longer
kept
carefully
they
fell
into
disuse
men
began
to
forget
years
to
forget
time
at
all
of
what
significance
was
time
when
one
was
immortal
after
long
long
uncounted
centuries
a
time
came
when
the
days
grew
noticeably
colder
slowly
the
winters
became
longer
and
the
summers
diminished
to
but
a
month
or
two
fierce
storms
raged
endlessly
in
winter
and
in
summer
sometimes
there
was
severe
frost
sometimes
there
was
only
frost
in
the
high
places
and
in
the
north
and
the
south
the
snow
came
and
would
not
go
men
died
by
the
thousands
in
the
higher
latitudes
new
york
became
after
awhile
the
furthest
habitable
city
north
an
arctic
city
where
warmth
seldom
penetrated
and
great
fields
of
ice
began
to
make
their
way
southward
grinding
before
them
the
brittle
remains
of
civilizations
covering
over
relentlessly
all
of
man
proud
work
snow
appeared
in
florida
and
italy
one
summer
in
the
end
snow
was
there
always
men
left
new
york
chicago
paris
yokohama
and
everywhere
they
traveled
by
the
millions
southward
perishing
as
they
went
pursued
by
the
snow
and
the
cold
and
that
inevitable
field
of
ice
they
were
feeble
creatures
when
the
cold
first
came
upon
them
but
i
speak
in
terms
of
thousands
of
years
and
they
turned
every
weapon
of
science
to
the
recovery
of
their
physical
power
for
they
foresaw
that
the
only
chance
for
survival
lay
in
a
hard
strong
body
as
for
me
at
last
i
had
found
a
use
for
my
few
powers
for
my
physique
was
the
finest
in
that
world
it
was
but
little
comfort
however
for
we
were
all
united
in
our
awful
fear
of
that
cold
and
that
grinding
field
of
ice
all
the
great
cities
were
deserted
we
would
catch
silent
fearful
glimpses
of
them
as
we
sped
on
in
our
machines
over
the
snow
great
hungry
haggard
skeletons
of
cities
shrouded
in
banks
of
snow
snow
that
the
wind
rustled
through
desolate
streets
where
the
cream
of
human
life
once
had
passed
in
calm
security
yet
still
the
ice
pursued
for
men
had
forgotten
about
that
last
ice
age
when
they
ceased
to
reckon
time
when
they
lost
sight
of
the
future
and
steeped
themselves
in
memories
they
had
not
remembered
that
a
time
must
come
when
ice
would
lie
white
and
smooth
over
all
the
earth
when
the
sun
would
shine
bleakly
between
unending
intervals
of
dim
twilight
snow
and
sleet
slowly
the
ice
pursued
us
down
the
earth
until
all
the
feeble
remains
of
civilization
were
gathered
in
egypt
and
india
and
south
america
the
deserts
flowered
again
but
the
frost
would
come
always
to
bite
the
tiny
crops
for
still
the
ice
came
all
the
world
now
but
for
a
narrow
strip
about
the
equator
was
one
great
silent
desolate
vista
of
stark
ice
that
brooded
above
the
hidden
ruins
of
cities
that
had
endured
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
it
was
terrible
to
imagine
the
awful
solitude
and
the
endless
twilight
that
lay
on
these
places
and
the
grim
snow
sailing
in
silence
over
all
it
surrounded
us
on
all
sides
until
life
remained
only
in
a
few
scattered
clearings
all
about
that
equator
of
the
globe
with
an
eternal
fire
going
to
hold
away
the
hungry
ice
perpetual
winter
reigned
now
and
we
were
becoming
beasts
that
preyed
on
each
other
for
a
life
already
doomed
ah
but
i
i
the
archaic
survival
i
had
my
revenge
then
with
my
great
physique
and
strong
jaws
god
let
me
think
of
something
else
those
men
who
lived
upon
each
other
it
was
horrible
and
i
was
one
so
inevitably
the
ice
closed
in
one
day
the
men
of
our
tiny
clearing
were
but
a
score
we
huddled
about
our
dying
fire
of
bones
and
stray
logs
we
said
nothing
we
just
sat
in
deep
wordless
thoughtless
silence
we
were
the
last
outpost
of
mankind
i
think
suddenly
something
very
noble
must
have
transformed
these
creatures
to
a
semblance
of
what
they
had
been
of
old
i
saw
in
their
eyes
the
question
they
sent
from
one
to
another
and
in
every
eye
i
saw
that
the
answer
was
yes
with
one
accord
they
rose
before
my
eyes
and
ignoring
me
as
a
baser
creature
they
stripped
away
their
load
of
tattered
rags
and
one
by
one
they
stalked
with
their
tiny
shrivelled
limbs
into
the
shivering
gale
of
swirling
gusting
snow
and
disappeared
and
i
was
alone
so
am
i
alone
now
i
have
written
this
last
fantastic
history
of
myself
and
of
mankind
upon
a
substance
that
will
i
know
outlast
even
the
snow
and
the
ice
as
it
has
outlasted
mankind
that
made
it
it
is
the
only
thing
with
which
i
have
never
parted
for
is
it
not
irony
that
i
should
be
the
historian
of
this
race
i
a
savage
an
archaic
survival
why
do
i
write
god
knows
but
some
instinct
prompts
me
although
there
will
never
be
men
to
read
i
have
been
sitting
here
waiting
and
i
have
thought
often
of
sir
john
and
alice
whom
i
loved
can
it
be
that
i
am
feeling
again
after
all
these
ages
some
tiny
portion
of
that
emotion
that
great
passion
i
once
knew
i
see
her
face
before
me
the
face
i
have
lost
from
my
thoughts
for
eons
and
something
is
in
it
that
stirs
my
blood
again
her
eyes
are
and
deep
her
lips
are
parted
as
though
i
could
crush
them
with
an
infinity
of
wonder
and
discovery
o
god
it
is
love
again
love
that
i
thought
was
lost
they
have
often
smiled
upon
me
when
i
spoke
of
god
and
muttered
about
my
foolish
primitive
superstitions
but
they
are
gone
and
i
am
left
who
believe
in
god
and
surely
there
is
purpose
in
it
i
am
cold
i
have
written
ah
i
am
frozen
my
breath
freezes
as
it
mingles
with
the
air
and
i
can
hardly
move
my
numbed
fingers
the
ice
is
closing
over
me
and
i
can
not
break
it
any
longer
the
storm
cries
weirdly
all
about
me
in
the
twilight
and
i
know
this
is
the
end
the
end
of
the
world
and
i
i
the
last
man
the
last
man
i
am
cold
cold
but
is
it
you
alice
is
it
you
the
end
