preface
english
writers
who
have
spoken
of
goethe
doctrine
of
colours
have
generally
confined
their
remarks
to
those
parts
of
the
work
in
which
he
has
undertaken
to
account
for
the
colours
of
the
prismatic
spectrum
and
of
refraction
altogether
on
principles
different
from
the
received
theory
of
newton
the
less
questionable
merits
of
the
treatise
consisting
of
a
mass
of
observations
and
experiments
many
of
which
are
important
and
interesting
have
thus
been
in
a
great
measure
overlooked
the
translator
aware
of
the
opposition
which
the
theoretical
views
alluded
to
have
met
with
intended
at
first
to
make
a
selection
of
such
of
the
experiments
as
seem
more
directly
applicable
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
painting
finding
however
that
the
alterations
this
would
have
involved
would
have
been
incompatible
with
a
clear
and
connected
view
of
the
statements
he
preferred
giving
the
theory
itself
entire
reflecting
at
the
same
time
that
some
scientific
readers
may
be
curious
to
hear
the
author
speak
for
himself
even
on
the
points
at
issue
in
reviewing
the
history
and
progress
of
his
opinions
and
researches
goethe
tells
us
that
he
first
submitted
his
views
to
the
public
in
two
short
essays
entitled
contributions
to
optics
among
the
circumstances
which
he
supposes
were
unfavourable
to
him
on
that
occasion
he
mentions
the
choice
of
his
title
observing
that
by
a
reference
to
optics
he
must
have
appeared
to
make
pretensions
to
a
knowledge
of
mathematics
a
science
with
which
he
admits
he
was
very
imperfectly
acquainted
another
cause
to
which
he
attributes
the
severe
treatment
he
experienced
was
his
having
ventured
so
openly
to
question
the
truth
of
the
established
theory
but
this
last
provocation
could
not
be
owing
to
mere
inadvertence
on
his
part
indeed
the
larger
work
in
which
he
alludes
to
these
circumstances
is
still
more
remarkable
for
the
violence
of
his
objections
to
the
newtonian
doctrine
there
can
be
no
doubt
however
that
much
of
the
opposition
goethe
met
with
was
to
be
attributed
to
the
manner
as
well
as
to
the
substance
of
his
statements
had
he
contented
himself
with
merely
detailing
his
experiments
and
showing
their
application
to
the
laws
of
chromatic
harmony
leaving
it
to
others
to
reconcile
them
as
they
could
with
the
system
or
even
to
doubt
in
consequence
the
truth
of
some
of
the
newtonian
conclusions
he
would
have
enjoyed
the
credit
he
deserved
for
the
accuracy
and
the
utility
of
his
investigations
as
it
was
the
uncompromising
expression
of
his
convictions
only
exposed
him
to
the
resentment
or
silent
neglect
of
a
great
portion
of
the
scientific
world
so
that
for
a
time
he
could
not
even
obtain
a
fair
hearing
for
the
less
objectionable
or
rather
highly
valuable
communications
contained
in
his
book
a
specimen
of
his
manner
of
alluding
to
the
newtonian
theory
will
be
seen
in
the
preface
it
was
quite
natural
that
this
spirit
should
call
forth
a
somewhat
vindictive
feeling
and
with
it
not
a
little
uncandid
as
well
as
unsparing
criticism
the
doctrine
of
colours
met
with
this
reception
in
germany
long
before
it
was
noticed
in
england
where
a
milder
and
fairer
treatment
could
hardly
be
expected
especially
at
a
time
when
owing
perhaps
to
the
limited
intercourse
with
the
continent
german
literature
was
far
less
popular
than
it
is
at
present
this
last
fact
it
is
true
can
be
of
little
importance
in
the
present
instance
for
although
the
change
of
opinion
with
regard
to
the
genius
of
an
enlightened
nation
must
be
acknowledged
to
be
beneficial
it
is
to
be
hoped
there
is
no
fashion
in
science
and
the
translator
begs
to
state
once
for
all
that
in
advocating
the
neglected
merits
of
the
doctrine
of
colours
he
is
far
from
undertaking
to
defend
its
imputed
errors
sufficient
time
has
however
now
elapsed
since
the
publication
of
this
work
in
to
allow
a
calmer
and
more
candid
examination
of
its
claims
in
this
more
pleasing
task
germany
has
again
for
some
time
led
the
way
and
many
scientific
investigators
have
followed
up
the
hints
and
observations
of
goethe
with
a
due
acknowledgment
of
the
acuteness
of
his
views
it
may
require
more
magnanimity
in
english
scientific
readers
to
do
justice
to
the
merits
of
one
who
was
so
open
and
in
many
respects
it
is
believed
so
mistaken
an
opponent
of
newton
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
statements
of
goethe
contain
more
useful
principles
in
all
that
relates
to
harmony
of
colour
than
any
that
have
been
derived
from
the
established
doctrine
it
is
no
derogation
of
the
more
important
truths
of
the
newtonian
theory
to
say
that
the
views
it
contains
seldom
appear
in
a
form
calculated
for
direct
application
to
the
arts
the
principle
of
contrast
so
universally
exhibited
in
nature
so
apparent
in
the
action
and
of
the
eye
itself
is
scarcely
hinted
at
the
equal
pretensions
of
seven
colours
as
such
and
the
fanciful
analogies
which
their
assumed
proportions
could
suggest
have
rarely
found
favour
with
the
votaries
of
taste
indeed
they
have
long
been
abandoned
even
by
scientific
authorities
and
here
the
translator
stops
he
is
quite
aware
that
the
defects
which
make
the
newtonian
theory
so
little
available
for
æsthetic
application
are
far
from
invalidating
its
more
important
conclusions
in
the
opinion
of
most
scientific
men
in
carefully
abstaining
therefore
from
any
comparison
between
the
two
theories
in
these
latter
respects
he
may
still
be
permitted
to
advocate
the
clearness
and
fulness
of
experiments
the
german
philosopher
reduces
the
colours
to
their
origin
and
simplest
elements
he
sees
and
constantly
bears
in
mind
and
sometimes
ably
elucidates
the
phenomena
of
contrast
and
gradation
two
principles
which
may
be
said
to
make
up
the
artist
world
and
to
constitute
the
chief
elements
of
beauty
these
hints
occur
mostly
in
what
may
be
called
the
scientific
part
of
the
work
on
the
other
hand
in
the
portion
expressly
devoted
to
the
æsthetic
application
of
the
doctrine
the
author
seems
to
have
made
but
an
inadequate
use
of
his
own
principles
in
that
part
of
the
chapter
on
chemical
colours
which
relates
to
the
colours
of
plants
and
animals
the
same
genius
and
originality
which
are
displayed
in
the
essays
on
morphology
and
which
have
secured
to
goethe
undisputed
rank
among
the
investigators
of
nature
are
frequently
apparent
but
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
goethe
theory
although
it
can
not
be
a
recommendation
in
a
scientific
point
of
view
is
that
it
contains
undoubtedly
with
very
great
improvements
the
general
doctrine
of
the
ancients
and
of
the
italians
at
the
revival
of
letters
the
translator
has
endeavoured
in
some
notes
to
point
out
the
connexion
between
this
theory
and
the
practice
of
the
italian
painters
the
doctrine
of
colours
as
first
published
in
consists
of
two
volumes
in
and
sixteen
plates
with
descriptions
in
it
is
divided
into
three
parts
a
didactic
a
controversial
and
an
historical
part
the
present
translation
is
confined
to
the
first
of
these
with
such
extracts
from
the
other
two
as
seemed
necessary
in
fairness
to
the
author
to
explain
some
of
his
statements
the
polemical
and
historical
parts
are
frequently
alluded
to
in
the
preface
and
elsewhere
in
the
present
work
but
it
has
not
been
thought
advisable
to
omit
these
allusions
no
alterations
whatever
seem
to
have
been
made
by
goethe
in
the
didactic
portion
in
later
editions
but
he
subsequently
wrote
an
additional
chapter
on
entoptic
colours
expressing
his
wish
that
it
might
be
inserted
in
the
theory
itself
at
a
particular
place
which
he
points
out
the
form
of
this
additional
essay
is
however
very
different
from
that
of
the
rest
of
the
work
and
the
translator
has
therefore
merely
given
some
extracts
from
it
in
the
appendix
the
polemical
portion
has
been
more
than
once
omitted
in
later
editions
in
the
two
first
parts
the
author
statements
are
arranged
numerically
in
the
style
of
bacon
natural
history
this
we
are
told
was
for
the
convenience
of
reference
but
many
passages
are
thus
separately
numbered
which
hardly
seem
to
have
required
it
the
same
arrangement
is
however
strictly
followed
in
the
translation
to
facilitate
a
comparison
with
the
original
where
it
may
be
desired
and
here
the
translator
observes
that
although
he
has
sometimes
permitted
himself
to
make
slight
alterations
in
order
to
avoid
unnecessary
repetition
or
to
make
the
author
meaning
clearer
he
feels
that
an
apology
may
rather
be
expected
from
him
for
having
omitted
so
little
he
was
scrupulous
on
this
point
having
once
determined
to
translate
the
whole
treatise
partly
as
before
stated
from
a
wish
to
deal
fairly
with
a
controversial
writer
and
partly
because
many
passages
not
directly
bearing
on
the
scientific
views
are
still
characteristic
of
goethe
the
observations
which
the
translator
has
ventured
to
add
are
inserted
in
the
appendix
these
observations
are
chiefly
confined
to
such
of
the
author
opinions
and
conclusions
as
have
direct
reference
to
the
arts
they
seldom
interfere
with
the
scientific
propositions
even
where
these
have
been
considered
most
vulnerable
farbenlehre
in
the
present
translation
generally
rendered
theory
of
colours
sixteen
years
after
the
appearance
of
the
farbenlehre
johannes
müller
devoted
a
portion
of
his
work
zur
vergleichenden
physiologie
des
gesichtssinnes
des
menschen
und
der
thiere
to
the
critical
examination
of
goethe
theory
in
his
introductory
remarks
he
expresses
himself
as
follows
for
my
own
part
i
readily
acknowledge
that
i
have
been
greatly
indebted
to
goethe
treatise
and
can
truly
say
that
without
having
studied
it
for
some
years
in
connexion
with
the
actual
phenomena
the
present
work
would
hardly
have
been
undertaken
i
have
no
hesitation
in
confessing
more
particularly
that
i
have
full
faith
in
goethe
statements
where
they
are
merely
descriptive
of
the
phenomena
and
where
the
author
does
not
enter
into
explanations
involving
a
decision
on
the
great
points
of
controversy
the
names
of
hegel
schelling
seebeck
steffens
may
also
be
mentioned
and
many
others
might
be
added
as
authorities
more
or
less
favourable
to
the
farbenlehre
when
newton
attempted
to
reckon
up
the
rays
of
light
decomposed
by
the
prism
says
sir
john
leslie
and
ventured
to
assign
the
famous
number
he
was
apparently
influenced
by
some
lurking
disposition
towards
mysticism
if
any
unprejudiced
person
will
fairly
repeat
the
experiment
he
must
soon
be
convinced
that
the
various
coloured
spaces
which
paint
the
spectrum
slide
into
each
other
by
indefinite
shadings
he
may
name
four
or
five
principal
colours
but
the
subordinate
spaces
are
evidently
so
multiplied
as
to
be
incapable
of
enumeration
the
same
illustrious
mathematician
we
can
hardly
doubt
was
betrayed
by
a
passion
for
analogy
when
he
imagined
that
the
primary
colours
are
distributed
over
the
spectrum
after
the
proportions
of
the
diatonic
scale
of
music
since
those
intermediate
spaces
have
really
no
precise
and
defined
limits
on
various
subjects
of
natural
and
chemical
preface
to
the
first
edition
of
it
may
naturally
be
asked
whether
in
proposing
to
treat
of
colours
light
itself
should
not
first
engage
our
attention
to
this
we
briefly
and
frankly
answer
that
since
so
much
has
already
been
said
on
the
subject
of
light
it
can
hardly
be
desirable
to
multiply
repetitions
by
again
going
over
the
same
ground
indeed
strictly
speaking
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
express
the
nature
of
a
thing
abstractedly
effects
we
can
perceive
and
a
complete
history
of
those
effects
would
in
fact
sufficiently
define
the
nature
of
the
thing
itself
we
should
try
in
vain
to
describe
a
character
but
let
his
acts
be
collected
and
an
idea
of
the
character
will
be
presented
to
us
the
colours
are
acts
of
light
its
active
and
passive
modifications
thus
considered
we
may
expect
from
them
some
explanation
respecting
light
itself
colours
and
light
it
is
true
stand
in
the
most
intimate
relation
to
each
other
but
we
should
think
of
both
as
belonging
to
nature
as
a
whole
for
it
is
nature
as
a
whole
which
manifests
itself
by
their
means
in
an
especial
manner
to
the
sense
of
sight
the
completeness
of
nature
displays
itself
to
another
sense
in
a
similar
way
let
the
eye
be
closed
let
the
sense
of
hearing
be
excited
and
from
the
lightest
breath
to
the
wildest
din
from
the
simplest
sound
to
the
highest
harmony
from
the
most
vehement
and
impassioned
cry
to
the
gentlest
word
of
reason
still
it
is
nature
that
speaks
and
manifests
her
presence
her
power
her
pervading
life
and
the
vastness
of
her
relations
so
that
a
blind
man
to
whom
the
infinite
visible
is
denied
can
still
comprehend
an
infinite
vitality
by
means
of
another
organ
and
thus
as
we
descend
the
scale
of
being
nature
speaks
to
other
senses
to
known
misunderstood
and
unknown
senses
so
speaks
she
with
herself
and
to
us
in
a
thousand
modes
to
the
attentive
observer
she
is
nowhere
dead
nor
silent
she
has
even
a
secret
agent
in
inflexible
matter
in
a
metal
the
smallest
portions
of
which
tell
us
what
is
passing
in
the
entire
mass
however
manifold
complicated
and
unintelligible
this
language
may
often
seem
to
us
yet
its
elements
remain
ever
the
same
with
light
poise
and
counterpoise
nature
oscillates
within
her
prescribed
limits
yet
thus
arise
all
the
varieties
and
conditions
of
the
phenomena
which
are
presented
to
us
in
space
and
time
infinitely
various
are
the
means
by
which
we
become
acquainted
with
these
general
movements
and
tendencies
now
as
a
simple
repulsion
and
attraction
now
as
an
upsparkling
and
vanishing
light
as
undulation
in
the
air
as
commotion
in
matter
as
oxydation
and
but
always
uniting
or
separating
the
great
purpose
is
found
to
be
to
excite
and
promote
existence
in
some
form
or
other
the
observers
of
nature
finding
however
that
this
poise
and
counterpoise
are
respectively
unequal
in
effect
have
endeavoured
to
represent
such
a
relation
in
terms
they
have
everywhere
remarked
and
spoken
of
a
greater
and
lesser
principle
an
action
and
resistance
a
doing
and
suffering
an
advancing
and
retiring
a
violent
and
moderating
power
and
thus
a
symbolical
language
has
arisen
which
from
its
close
analogy
may
be
employed
as
equivalent
to
a
direct
and
appropriate
terminology
to
apply
these
designations
this
language
of
nature
to
the
subject
we
have
undertaken
to
enrich
and
amplify
this
language
by
means
of
the
theory
of
colours
and
the
variety
of
their
phenomena
and
thus
facilitate
the
communication
of
higher
theoretical
views
was
the
principal
aim
of
the
present
treatise
the
work
itself
is
divided
into
three
parts
the
first
contains
the
outline
of
a
theory
of
colours
in
this
the
innumerable
cases
which
present
themselves
to
the
observer
are
collected
under
certain
leading
phenomena
according
to
an
arrangement
which
will
be
explained
in
the
introduction
and
here
it
may
be
remarked
that
although
we
have
adhered
throughout
to
experiment
and
throughout
considered
it
as
our
basis
yet
the
theoretical
views
which
led
to
the
arrangement
alluded
to
could
not
but
be
stated
it
is
sometimes
unreasonably
required
by
persons
who
do
not
even
themselves
attend
to
such
a
condition
that
experimental
information
should
be
submitted
without
any
connecting
theory
to
the
reader
or
scholar
who
is
himself
to
form
his
conclusions
as
he
may
list
surely
the
mere
inspection
of
a
subject
can
profit
us
but
little
every
act
of
seeing
leads
to
consideration
consideration
to
reflection
reflection
to
combination
and
thus
it
may
be
said
that
in
every
attentive
look
on
nature
we
already
theorise
but
in
order
to
guard
against
the
possible
abuse
of
this
abstract
view
in
order
that
the
practical
deductions
we
look
to
should
be
really
useful
we
should
theorise
without
forgetting
that
we
are
so
doing
we
should
theorise
with
mental
and
to
use
a
bold
word
with
irony
in
the
second
part
we
examine
the
newtonian
theory
a
theory
which
by
its
ascendancy
and
consideration
has
hitherto
impeded
a
free
inquiry
into
the
phenomena
of
colours
we
combat
that
hypothesis
for
although
it
is
no
longer
found
available
it
still
retains
a
traditional
authority
in
the
world
its
real
relations
to
its
subject
will
require
to
be
plainly
pointed
out
the
old
errors
must
be
cleared
away
if
the
theory
of
colours
is
not
still
to
remain
in
the
rear
of
so
many
other
better
investigated
departments
of
natural
science
since
however
this
second
part
of
our
work
may
appear
somewhat
dry
as
regards
its
matter
and
perhaps
too
vehement
and
excited
in
its
manner
we
may
here
be
permitted
to
introduce
a
sort
of
allegory
in
a
lighter
style
as
a
prelude
to
that
graver
portion
and
as
some
excuse
for
the
earnestness
alluded
to
we
compare
the
newtonian
theory
of
colours
to
an
old
castle
which
was
at
first
constructed
by
its
architect
with
youthful
precipitation
it
was
however
gradually
enlarged
and
equipped
by
him
according
to
the
exigencies
of
time
and
circumstances
and
moreover
was
still
further
fortified
and
secured
in
consequence
of
feuds
and
hostile
demonstrations
the
same
system
was
pursued
by
his
successors
and
heirs
their
increased
wants
within
the
harassing
vigilance
of
their
opponents
without
and
various
accidents
compelled
them
in
some
places
to
build
near
in
others
in
connexion
with
the
fabric
and
thus
to
extend
the
original
plan
it
became
necessary
to
connect
all
these
incongruous
parts
and
additions
by
the
strangest
galleries
halls
and
passages
all
damages
whether
inflicted
by
the
hand
of
the
enemy
or
the
power
of
time
were
quickly
made
good
as
occasion
required
they
deepened
the
moats
raised
the
walls
and
took
care
there
should
be
no
lack
of
towers
battlements
and
embrasures
this
care
and
these
exertions
gave
rise
to
a
prejudice
in
favour
of
the
great
importance
of
the
fortress
and
still
upheld
that
prejudice
although
the
arts
of
building
and
fortification
were
by
this
time
very
much
advanced
and
people
had
learnt
to
construct
much
better
dwellings
and
defences
in
other
cases
but
the
old
castle
was
chiefly
held
in
honour
because
it
had
never
been
taken
because
it
had
repulsed
so
many
assaults
had
baffled
so
many
hostile
operations
and
had
always
preserved
its
virgin
renown
this
renown
this
influence
lasts
even
now
it
occurs
to
no
one
that
the
old
castle
is
become
uninhabitable
its
great
duration
its
costly
construction
are
still
constantly
spoken
of
pilgrims
wend
their
way
to
it
hasty
sketches
of
it
are
shown
in
all
schools
and
it
is
thus
recommended
to
the
reverence
of
susceptible
youth
meanwhile
the
building
itself
is
already
abandoned
its
only
inmates
are
a
few
invalids
who
in
simple
seriousness
imagine
that
they
are
prepared
for
war
thus
there
is
no
question
here
respecting
a
tedious
siege
or
a
doubtful
war
so
far
from
it
we
find
this
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
already
nodding
to
its
fall
as
a
deserted
piece
of
antiquity
and
begin
at
once
without
further
ceremony
to
dismantle
it
from
gable
and
roof
downwards
that
the
sun
may
at
last
shine
into
the
old
nest
of
rats
and
owls
and
exhibit
to
the
eye
of
the
wondering
traveller
that
labyrinthine
incongruous
style
of
building
with
its
scanty
contrivances
the
result
of
accident
and
emergency
its
intentional
artifice
and
clumsy
repairs
such
an
inspection
will
however
only
be
possible
when
wall
after
wall
arch
after
arch
is
demolished
the
rubbish
being
at
once
cleared
away
as
well
as
it
can
be
to
effect
this
and
to
level
the
site
where
it
is
possible
to
do
so
to
arrange
the
materials
thus
acquired
so
that
they
can
be
hereafter
again
employed
for
a
new
building
is
the
arduous
duty
we
have
undertaken
in
this
second
part
should
we
succeed
by
a
cheerful
application
of
all
possible
ability
and
dexterity
in
razing
this
bastille
and
in
gaining
a
free
space
it
is
thus
by
no
means
intended
at
once
to
cover
the
site
again
and
to
encumber
it
with
a
new
structure
we
propose
rather
to
make
use
of
this
area
for
the
purpose
of
passing
in
review
a
pleasing
and
varied
series
of
illustrative
figures
the
third
part
is
thus
devoted
to
the
historical
account
of
early
inquirers
and
investigators
as
we
before
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
history
of
an
individual
displays
his
character
so
it
may
here
be
well
affirmed
that
the
history
of
science
is
science
itself
we
can
not
clearly
be
aware
of
what
we
possess
till
we
have
the
means
of
knowing
what
others
possessed
before
us
we
can
not
really
and
honestly
rejoice
in
the
advantages
of
our
own
time
if
we
know
not
how
to
appreciate
the
advantages
of
former
periods
but
it
was
impossible
to
write
or
even
to
prepare
the
way
for
a
history
of
the
theory
of
colours
while
the
newtonian
theory
existed
for
no
aristocratic
presumption
has
ever
looked
down
on
those
who
were
not
of
its
order
with
such
intolerable
arrogance
as
that
betrayed
by
the
newtonian
school
in
deciding
on
all
that
had
been
done
in
earlier
times
and
all
that
was
done
around
it
with
disgust
and
indignation
we
find
priestley
in
his
history
of
optics
like
many
before
and
after
him
dating
the
success
of
all
researches
into
the
world
of
colours
from
the
epoch
of
a
decomposed
ray
of
light
or
what
pretended
to
be
so
looking
down
with
a
supercilious
air
on
the
ancient
and
less
modern
inquirers
who
after
all
had
proceeded
quietly
in
the
right
road
and
who
have
transmitted
to
us
observations
and
thoughts
in
detail
which
we
can
neither
arrange
better
nor
conceive
more
justly
we
have
a
right
to
expect
from
one
who
proposes
to
give
the
history
of
any
science
that
he
inform
us
how
the
phenomena
of
which
it
treats
were
gradually
known
and
what
was
imagined
conjectured
assumed
or
thought
respecting
them
to
state
all
this
in
due
connexion
is
by
no
means
an
easy
task
need
we
say
that
to
write
a
history
at
all
is
always
a
hazardous
affair
with
the
most
honest
intention
there
is
always
a
danger
of
being
dishonest
for
in
such
an
undertaking
a
writer
tacitly
announces
at
the
outset
that
he
means
to
place
some
things
in
light
others
in
shade
the
author
has
nevertheless
long
derived
pleasure
from
the
prosecution
of
his
task
but
as
it
is
the
intention
only
that
presents
itself
to
the
mind
as
a
whole
while
the
execution
is
generally
accomplished
portion
by
portion
he
is
compelled
to
admit
that
instead
of
a
history
he
furnishes
only
materials
for
one
these
materials
consist
in
translations
extracts
original
and
borrowed
comments
hints
and
notes
a
collection
in
short
which
if
not
answering
all
that
is
required
has
at
least
the
merit
of
having
been
made
with
earnestness
and
interest
lastly
such
materials
not
altogether
untouched
it
is
true
but
still
not
exhausted
may
be
more
satisfactory
to
the
reflecting
reader
in
the
state
in
which
they
are
as
he
can
easily
combine
them
according
to
his
own
judgment
this
third
part
containing
the
history
of
the
science
does
not
however
thus
conclude
the
subject
a
fourth
supplementary
portion
is
added
this
contains
a
recapitulation
or
revision
with
a
view
to
which
chiefly
the
paragraphs
are
headed
numerically
in
the
execution
of
a
work
of
this
kind
some
things
may
be
forgotten
some
are
of
necessity
omitted
so
as
not
to
distract
the
attention
some
can
only
be
arrived
at
as
corollaries
and
others
may
require
to
be
exemplified
and
verified
on
all
these
accounts
postscripts
additions
and
corrections
are
indispensable
this
part
contains
besides
some
detached
essays
for
example
that
on
the
atmospheric
colours
for
as
these
are
introduced
in
the
theory
itself
without
any
classification
they
are
here
presented
to
the
mind
eye
at
one
view
again
if
this
essay
invites
the
reader
to
consult
nature
herself
another
is
intended
to
recommend
the
artificial
aids
of
science
by
circumstantially
describing
the
apparatus
which
will
in
future
be
necessary
to
assist
researches
into
the
theory
of
colours
in
conclusion
it
only
remains
to
speak
of
the
plates
which
are
added
at
the
end
of
the
work
and
here
we
confess
we
are
reminded
of
that
incompleteness
and
imperfection
which
the
present
undertaking
has
in
common
with
all
others
of
its
class
for
as
a
good
play
can
be
in
fact
only
half
transmitted
to
writing
a
great
part
of
its
effect
depending
on
the
scene
the
personal
qualities
of
the
actor
the
powers
of
his
voice
the
peculiarities
of
his
gestures
and
even
the
spirit
and
favourable
humour
of
the
spectators
so
it
is
in
a
still
greater
degree
with
a
book
which
treats
of
the
appearances
of
nature
to
be
enjoyed
to
be
turned
to
account
nature
herself
must
be
present
to
the
reader
either
really
or
by
the
help
of
a
lively
imagination
indeed
the
author
should
in
such
cases
communicate
his
observations
orally
exhibiting
the
phenomena
he
describes
as
a
text
in
the
first
instance
partly
as
they
appear
to
us
unsought
partly
as
they
may
be
presented
by
contrivance
to
serve
in
particular
illustration
explanation
and
description
could
not
then
fail
to
produce
a
lively
impression
the
plates
which
generally
accompany
works
like
the
present
are
thus
a
most
inadequate
substitute
for
all
this
a
physical
phenomenon
exhibiting
its
effects
on
all
sides
is
not
to
be
arrested
in
lines
nor
denoted
by
a
section
no
one
ever
dreams
of
explaining
chemical
experiments
with
figures
yet
it
is
customary
in
physical
researches
nearly
allied
to
these
because
the
object
is
thus
found
to
be
in
some
degree
answered
in
many
cases
however
such
diagrams
represent
mere
notions
they
are
symbolical
resources
hieroglyphic
modes
of
communication
which
by
degrees
assume
the
place
of
the
phenomena
and
of
nature
herself
and
thus
rather
hinder
than
promote
true
knowledge
in
the
present
instance
we
could
not
dispense
with
plates
but
we
have
endeavoured
so
to
construct
them
that
they
may
be
confidently
referred
to
for
the
explanation
of
the
didactic
and
polemical
portions
some
of
these
may
even
be
considered
as
forming
part
of
the
apparatus
before
mentioned
we
now
therefore
refer
the
reader
to
the
work
itself
first
only
repeating
a
request
which
many
an
author
has
already
made
in
vain
and
which
the
modern
german
reader
especially
so
seldom
grants
si
quid
novisti
rectius
istis
candidus
imperti
si
non

the
polemical
part
this
preface
must
have
been
written
before
the
work
was
finished
for
at
the
conclusion
of
the
historical
part
there
is
only

introduction
the
desire
of
knowledge
is
first
stimulated
in
us
when
remarkable
phenomena
attract
our
attention
in
order
that
this
attention
be
continued
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
feel
some
interest
in
exercising
it
and
thus
by
degrees
we
become
better
acquainted
with
the
object
of
our
curiosity
during
this
process
of
observation
we
remark
at
first
only
a
vast
variety
which
presses
indiscriminately
on
our
view
we
are
forced
to
separate
to
distinguish
and
again
to
combine
by
which
means
at
last
a
certain
order
arises
which
admits
of
being
surveyed
with
more
or
less
satisfaction
to
accomplish
this
only
in
a
certain
degree
in
any
department
requires
an
unremitting
and
close
application
and
we
find
for
this
reason
that
men
prefer
substituting
a
general
theoretical
view
or
some
system
of
explanation
for
the
facts
themselves
instead
of
taking
the
trouble
to
make
themselves
first
acquainted
with
cases
in
detail
and
then
constructing
a
whole
the
attempt
to
describe
and
class
the
phenomena
of
colours
has
been
only
twice
made
first
by
theophrastus
and
in
modern
times
by
boyle
the
pretensions
of
the
present
essay
to
the
third
place
will
hardly
be
disputed
our
historical
survey
enters
into
further
details
here
we
merely
observe
that
in
the
last
century
such
a
classification
was
not
to
be
thought
of
because
newton
had
based
his
hypothesis
on
a
phenomenon
exhibited
in
a
complicated
and
secondary
state
and
to
this
the
other
cases
that
forced
themselves
on
the
attention
were
contrived
to
be
referred
when
they
could
not
be
passed
over
in
silence
just
as
an
astronomer
would
do
if
from
whim
he
were
to
place
the
moon
in
the
centre
of
our
system
he
would
be
compelled
to
make
the
earth
sun
and
planets
revolve
round
the
lesser
body
and
be
forced
to
disguise
and
gloss
over
the
error
of
his
first
assumption
by
ingenious
calculations
and
plausible
statements
in
our
prefatory
observations
we
assumed
the
reader
to
be
acquainted
with
what
was
known
respecting
light
here
we
assume
the
same
with
regard
to
the
eye
we
observed
that
all
nature
manifests
itself
by
means
of
colours
to
the
sense
of
sight
we
now
assert
extraordinary
as
it
may
in
some
degree
appear
that
the
eye
sees
no
form
inasmuch
as
light
shade
and
colour
together
constitute
that
which
to
our
vision
distinguishes
object
from
object
and
the
parts
of
an
object
from
each
other
from
these
three
light
shade
and
colour
we
construct
the
visible
world
and
thus
at
the
same
time
make
painting
possible
an
art
which
has
the
power
of
producing
on
a
flat
surface
a
much
more
perfect
visible
world
than
the
actual
one
can
be
the
eye
may
be
said
to
owe
its
existence
to
light
which
calls
forth
as
it
were
a
sense
that
is
akin
to
itself
the
eye
in
short
is
formed
with
reference
to
light
to
be
fit
for
the
action
of
light
the
light
it
contains
corresponding
with
the
light
without
we
are
here
reminded
of
a
significant
adage
in
constant
use
with
the
ancient
ionian
school
like
is
only
known
by
like
and
again
of
the
words
of
an
old
mystic
writer
which
may
be
thus
rendered
if
the
eye
were
not
sunny
how
could
we
perceive
light
if
god
own
strength
lived
not
in
us
how
could
we
delight
in
divine
things
this
immediate
affinity
between
light
and
the
eye
will
be
denied
by
none
to
consider
them
as
identical
in
substance
is
less
easy
to
comprehend
it
will
be
more
intelligible
to
assert
that
a
dormant
light
resides
in
the
eye
and
that
it
may
be
excited
by
the
slightest
cause
from
within
or
from
without
in
darkness
we
can
by
an
effort
of
imagination
call
up
the
brightest
images
in
dreams
objects
appear
to
us
as
in
broad
daylight
awake
the
slightest
external
action
of
light
is
perceptible
and
if
the
organ
suffers
an
actual
shock
light
and
colours
spring
forth
here
however
those
who
are
wont
to
proceed
according
to
a
certain
method
may
perhaps
observe
that
as
yet
we
have
not
decidedly
explained
what
colour
is
this
question
like
the
definition
of
light
and
the
eye
we
would
for
the
present
evade
and
would
appeal
to
our
inquiry
itself
where
we
have
circumstantially
shown
how
colour
is
produced
we
have
only
therefore
to
repeat
that
colour
is
a
law
of
nature
in
relation
with
the
sense
of
sight
we
must
assume
too
that
every
one
has
this
sense
that
every
one
knows
the
operation
of
nature
on
it
for
to
a
blind
man
it
would
be
impossible
to
speak
of
colours
that
we
may
not
however
appear
too
anxious
to
shun
such
an
explanation
we
would
restate
what
has
been
said
as
follows
colour
is
an
elementary
phenomenon
in
nature
adapted
to
the
sense
of
vision
a
phenomenon
which
like
all
others
exhibits
itself
by
separation
and
contrast
by
commixture
and
union
by
augmentation
and
neutralization
by
communication
and
dissolution
under
these
general
terms
its
nature
may
be
best
comprehended
we
do
not
press
this
mode
of
stating
the
subject
on
any
one
those
who
like
ourselves
find
it
convenient
will
readily
adopt
it
but
we
have
no
desire
to
enter
the
lists
hereafter
in
its
defence
from
time
immemorial
it
has
been
dangerous
to
treat
of
colour
so
much
so
that
one
of
our
predecessors
ventured
on
a
certain
occasion
to
say
the
ox
becomes
furious
if
a
red
cloth
is
shown
to
him
but
the
philosopher
who
speaks
of
colour
only
in
a
general
way
begins
to
rave
nevertheless
if
we
are
to
proceed
to
give
some
account
of
our
work
to
which
we
have
appealed
we
must
begin
by
explaining
how
we
have
classed
the
different
conditions
under
which
colour
is
produced
we
found
three
modes
in
which
it
appears
three
classes
of
colours
or
rather
three
exhibitions
of
them
all
the
distinctions
of
these
classes
are
easily
expressed
thus
in
the
first
instance
we
considered
colours
as
far
as
they
may
be
said
to
belong
to
the
eye
itself
and
to
depend
on
an
action
and
of
the
organ
next
they
attracted
our
attention
as
perceived
in
or
by
means
of
colourless
mediums
and
lastly
where
we
could
consider
them
as
belonging
to
particular
substances
we
have
denominated
the
first
physiological
the
second
physical
the
third
chemical
colours
the
first
are
fleeting
and
not
to
be
arrested
the
next
are
passing
but
still
for
a
while
enduring
the
last
may
be
made
permanent
for
any
length
of
time
having
separated
these
classes
and
kept
them
as
distinct
as
possible
with
a
view
to
a
clear
didactic
exposition
we
have
been
enabled
at
the
same
time
to
exhibit
them
in
an
unbroken
series
to
connect
the
fleeting
with
the
somewhat
more
enduring
and
these
again
with
the
permanent
hues
and
thus
after
having
carefully
attended
to
a
distinct
classification
in
the
first
instance
to
do
away
with
it
again
when
a
larger
view
was
desirable
in
a
fourth
division
of
our
work
we
have
therefore
treated
generally
what
was
previously
detailed
under
various
particular
conditions
and
have
thus
in
fact
given
a
sketch
for
a
future
theory
of
colours
we
will
here
only
anticipate
our
statements
so
far
as
to
observe
that
light
and
darkness
brightness
and
obscurity
or
if
a
more
general
expression
is
preferred
light
and
its
absence
are
necessary
to
the
production
of
colour
next
to
the
light
a
colour
appears
which
we
call
yellow
another
appears
next
to
the
darkness
which
we
name
blue
when
these
in
their
purest
state
are
so
mixed
that
they
are
exactly
equal
they
produce
a
third
colour
called
green
each
of
the
two
colours
can
however
of
itself
produce
a
new
tint
by
being
condensed
or
darkened
they
thus
acquire
a
reddish
appearance
which
can
be
increased
to
so
great
a
degree
that
the
original
blue
or
yellow
is
hardly
to
be
recognised
in
it
but
the
intensest
and
purest
red
especially
in
physical
cases
is
produced
when
the
two
extremes
of
the
and
are
united
this
is
the
actual
state
of
the
appearance
and
generation
of
colours
but
we
can
also
assume
an
existing
red
in
addition
to
the
definite
existing
blue
and
yellow
and
we
can
produce
contrariwise
by
mixing
what
we
directly
produced
by
augmentation
or
deepening
with
these
three
or
six
colours
which
may
be
conveniently
included
in
a
circle
the
elementary
doctrine
of
colours
is
alone
concerned
all
other
modifications
which
may
be
extended
to
infinity
have
reference
more
to
the
application
have
reference
to
the
technical
operations
of
the
painter
and
dyer
and
the
various
purposes
of
artificial
life
to
point
out
another
general
quality
we
may
observe
that
colours
throughout
are
to
be
considered
as
as
on
which
account
if
they
are
so
mixed
as
reciprocally
to
destroy
their
specific
hues
a
shadowy
tint
a
grey
is
produced
in
the
fifth
division
of
our
inquiry
we
had
proposed
to
point
out
the
relations
in
which
we
should
wish
our
doctrine
of
colours
to
stand
to
other
pursuits
important
as
this
part
of
our
work
is
it
is
perhaps
on
this
very
account
not
so
successful
as
we
could
wish
yet
when
we
reflect
that
strictly
speaking
these
relations
can
not
be
described
before
they
exist
we
may
console
ourselves
if
we
have
in
some
degree
failed
in
endeavouring
for
the
first
time
to
define
them
for
undoubtedly
we
should
first
wait
to
see
how
those
whom
we
have
endeavoured
to
serve
to
whom
we
have
intended
to
make
an
agreeable
and
useful
offering
how
such
persons
we
say
will
accept
the
result
of
our
utmost
exertion
whether
they
will
adopt
it
whether
they
will
make
use
of
it
and
follow
it
up
or
whether
they
will
repel
reject
and
suffer
it
to
remain
unassisted
and
neglected
meanwhile
we
venture
to
express
what
we
believe
and
hope
from
the
philosopher
we
believe
we
merit
thanks
for
having
traced
the
phenomena
of
colours
to
their
first
sources
to
the
circumstances
under
which
they
simply
appear
and
are
and
beyond
which
no
further
explanation
respecting
them
is
possible
it
will
besides
be
gratifying
to
him
that
we
have
arranged
the
appearances
described
in
a
form
that
admits
of
being
easily
surveyed
even
should
he
not
altogether
approve
of
the
arrangement
itself
the
medical
practitioner
especially
him
whose
study
it
is
to
watch
over
the
organ
of
sight
to
preserve
it
to
assist
its
defects
and
to
cure
its
disorders
we
reckon
to
make
especially
our
friend
in
the
chapter
on
the
physiological
colours
in
the
appendix
relating
to
those
that
are
more
strictly
pathological
he
will
find
himself
quite
in
his
own
province
we
are
not
without
hopes
of
seeing
the
physiological
phenomena
a
hitherto
neglected
and
we
may
add
most
important
branch
of
the
theory
of
colours
completely
investigated
through
the
exertions
of
those
individuals
who
in
our
own
times
are
treating
this
department
with
success
the
investigator
of
nature
should
receive
us
cordially
since
we
enable
him
to
exhibit
the
doctrine
of
colours
in
the
series
of
other
elementary
phenomena
and
at
the
same
time
enable
him
to
make
use
of
a
corresponding
nomenclature
nay
almost
the
same
words
and
designations
as
under
the
other
rubrics
it
is
true
we
give
him
rather
more
trouble
as
a
teacher
for
the
chapter
of
colours
is
not
now
to
be
dismissed
as
heretofore
with
a
few
paragraphs
and
experiments
nor
will
the
scholar
submit
to
be
so
scantily
entertained
as
he
has
hitherto
been
without
murmuring
on
the
other
hand
an
advantage
will
afterwards
arise
out
of
this
for
if
the
newtonian
doctrine
was
easily
learnt
insurmountable
difficulties
presented
themselves
in
its
application
our
theory
is
perhaps
more
difficult
to
comprehend
but
once
known
all
is
accomplished
for
it
carries
its
application
along
with
it
the
chemist
who
looks
upon
colours
as
indications
by
which
he
may
detect
the
more
secret
properties
of
material
things
has
hitherto
found
much
inconvenience
in
the
denomination
and
description
of
colours
nay
some
have
been
induced
after
closer
and
nicer
examination
to
look
upon
colour
as
an
uncertain
and
fallacious
criterion
in
chemical
operations
yet
we
hope
by
means
of
our
arrangement
and
the
nomenclature
before
alluded
to
to
bring
colour
again
into
credit
and
to
awaken
the
conviction
that
a
progressive
augmenting
mutable
quality
a
quality
which
admits
of
alteration
even
to
inversion
is
not
fallacious
but
rather
calculated
to
bring
to
light
the
most
delicate
operations
of
nature
in
looking
a
little
further
round
us
we
are
not
without
fears
that
we
may
fail
to
satisfy
another
class
of
scientific
men
by
an
extraordinary
combination
of
circumstances
the
theory
of
colours
has
been
drawn
into
the
province
and
before
the
tribunal
of
the
mathematician
a
tribunal
to
which
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
amenable
this
was
owing
to
its
affinity
with
the
other
laws
of
vision
which
the
mathematician
was
legitimately
called
upon
to
treat
it
was
owing
again
to
another
circumstance
a
great
mathematician
had
investigated
the
theory
of
colours
and
having
been
mistaken
in
his
observations
as
an
experimentalist
he
employed
the
whole
force
of
his
talent
to
give
consistency
to
this
mistake
were
both
these
circumstances
considered
all
misunderstanding
would
presently
be
removed
and
the
mathematician
would
willingly
with
us
especially
in
the
physical
department
of
the
theory
to
the
practical
man
to
the
dyer
on
the
other
hand
our
labour
must
be
altogether
acceptable
for
it
was
precisely
those
who
reflected
on
the
facts
resulting
from
the
operations
of
dyeing
who
were
the
least
satisfied
with
the
old
theory
they
were
the
first
who
perceived
the
insufficiency
of
the
newtonian
doctrine
the
conclusions
of
men
are
very
different
according
to
the
mode
in
which
they
approach
a
science
or
branch
of
knowledge
from
which
side
through
which
door
they
enter
the
literally
practical
man
the
manufacturer
whose
attention
is
constantly
and
forcibly
called
to
the
facts
which
occur
under
his
eye
who
experiences
benefit
or
detriment
from
the
application
of
his
convictions
to
whom
loss
of
time
and
money
is
not
indifferent
who
is
desirous
of
advancing
who
aims
at
equalling
or
surpassing
what
others
have
accomplished
such
a
person
feels
the
unsoundness
and
erroneousness
of
a
theory
much
sooner
than
the
man
of
letters
in
whose
eyes
words
consecrated
by
authority
are
at
last
equivalent
to
solid
coin
than
the
mathematician
whose
formula
always
remains
infallible
even
although
the
foundation
on
which
it
is
constructed
may
not
square
with
it
again
to
carry
on
the
figure
before
employed
in
entering
this
theory
from
the
side
of
painting
from
the
side
of
æsthetic
colouring
generally
we
shall
be
found
to
have
accomplished
a
most
office
for
the
artist
in
the
sixth
part
we
have
endeavoured
to
define
the
effects
of
colour
as
addressed
at
once
to
the
eye
and
mind
with
a
view
to
making
them
more
available
for
the
purposes
of
art
although
much
in
this
portion
and
indeed
throughout
has
been
suffered
to
remain
as
a
sketch
it
should
be
remembered
that
all
theory
can
in
strictness
only
point
out
leading
principles
under
the
guidance
of
which
practice
may
proceed
with
vigour
and
be
enabled
to
attain
legitimate
results
the
treatise
to
which
the
author
alludes
in
more
generally
ascribed
to
t
æsthetic
belonging
to
taste
as
mere
internal
sense
from
αἰσθάνομαι
to
feel
the
word
was
first
used
by
t
part
physiological
colours
we
naturally
place
these
colours
first
because
they
belong
altogether
or
in
a
great
degree
to
the
to
the
eye
itself
they
are
the
foundation
of
the
whole
doctrine
and
open
to
our
view
the
chromatic
harmony
on
which
so
much
difference
of
opinion
has
existed
they
have
been
hitherto
looked
upon
as
extrinsic
and
casual
as
illusion
and
infirmity
their
appearances
have
been
known
from
ancient
date
but
as
they
were
too
evanescent
to
be
arrested
they
were
banished
into
the
region
of
phantoms
and
under
this
idea
have
been
very
variously
described
thus
they
are
called
by
boyle
and
by
rizetti
by
buffon
by
scherfer
apparent
colours
and
of
by
many
by
hamberger
by
darwin
we
have
called
them
physiological
because
they
belong
to
the
eye
in
a
healthy
state
because
we
consider
them
as
the
necessary
conditions
of
vision
the
lively
alternating
action
of
which
with
reference
to
external
objects
and
a
principle
within
it
is
thus
plainly
indicated
to
these
we
subjoin
the
pathological
colours
which
like
all
deviations
from
a
constant
law
afford
a
more
complete
insight
into
the
nature
of
the
physiological
colours
effects
of
light
and
darkness
on
the
eye
the
retina
after
being
acted
upon
by
light
or
darkness
is
found
to
be
in
two
different
states
which
are
entirely
opposed
to
each
other
if
we
keep
the
eyes
open
in
a
totally
dark
place
a
certain
sense
of
privation
is
experienced
the
organ
is
abandoned
to
itself
it
retires
into
itself
that
stimulating
and
grateful
contact
is
wanting
by
means
of
which
it
is
connected
with
the
external
world
and
becomes
part
of
a
whole
if
we
look
on
a
white
strongly
illumined
surface
the
eye
is
dazzled
and
for
a
time
is
incapable
of
distinguishing
objects
moderately
lighted
the
whole
of
the
retina
is
acted
on
in
each
of
these
extreme
states
and
thus
we
can
only
experience
one
of
these
effects
at
a
time
in
the
one
case
we
found
the
organ
in
the
utmost
relaxation
and
susceptibility
in
the
other
in
an
overstrained
state
and
scarcely
susceptible
at
all
if
we
pass
suddenly
from
the
one
state
to
the
other
even
without
supposing
these
to
be
the
extremes
but
only
perhaps
a
change
from
bright
to
dusky
the
difference
is
remarkable
and
we
find
that
the
effects
last
for
some
time
in
passing
from
bright
daylight
to
a
dusky
place
we
distinguish
nothing
at
first
by
degrees
the
eye
recovers
its
susceptibility
strong
eyes
sooner
than
weak
ones
the
former
in
a
minute
while
the
latter
may
require
seven
or
eight
minutes
the
fact
that
the
eye
is
not
susceptible
to
faint
impressions
of
light
if
we
pass
from
light
to
comparative
darkness
has
led
to
curious
mistakes
in
scientific
observations
thus
an
observer
whose
eyes
required
some
time
to
recover
their
tone
was
long
under
the
impression
that
rotten
wood
did
not
emit
light
at
even
in
a
dark
room
the
fact
was
he
did
not
see
the
faint
light
because
he
was
in
the
habit
of
passing
from
bright
sunshine
to
the
dark
room
and
only
subsequently
remained
so
long
there
that
the
eye
had
time
to
recover
itself
the
same
may
have
happened
to
doctor
wall
who
in
the
daytime
even
in
a
dark
room
could
hardly
perceive
the
electric
light
of
amber
our
not
seeing
the
stars
by
day
as
well
as
the
improved
appearance
of
pictures
seen
through
a
double
tube
is
also
to
be
attributed
to
the
same
cause
if
we
pass
from
a
totally
dark
place
to
one
illumined
by
the
sun
we
are
dazzled
in
coming
from
a
lesser
degree
of
darkness
to
light
that
is
not
dazzling
we
perceive
all
objects
clearer
and
better
hence
eyes
that
have
been
in
a
state
of
repose
are
in
all
cases
better
able
to
perceive
moderately
distinct
appearances
prisoners
who
have
been
long
confined
in
darkness
acquire
so
great
a
susceptibility
of
the
retina
that
even
in
the
dark
probably
a
darkness
very
slightly
illumined
they
can
still
distinguish
objects
in
the
act
which
we
call
seeing
the
retina
is
at
one
and
the
same
time
in
different
and
even
opposite
states
the
greatest
brightness
short
of
dazzling
acts
near
the
greatest
darkness
in
this
state
we
at
once
perceive
all
the
intermediate
gradations
of
and
all
the
varieties
of
hues
we
will
proceed
in
due
order
to
consider
and
examine
these
elements
of
the
visible
world
as
well
as
the
relation
in
which
the
organ
itself
stands
to
them
and
for
this
purpose
we
take
the
simplest
objects
the
german
distinction
between
and
is
so
generally
understood
and
adopted
that
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
explain
that
the
subject
is
the
in
this
case
the
the
object
that
is
without
t
ii
effects
of
black
and
white
objects
on
the
eye
in
the
same
manner
as
the
retina
generally
is
affected
by
brightness
and
darkness
so
it
is
affected
by
single
bright
or
dark
objects
if
light
and
dark
produce
different
results
on
the
whole
retina
so
black
and
white
objects
seen
at
the
same
time
produce
the
same
states
together
which
light
and
dark
occasioned
in
succession
a
dark
object
appears
smaller
than
a
bright
one
of
the
same
size
let
a
white
disk
be
placed
on
a
black
ground
and
a
black
disk
on
a
white
ground
both
being
exactly
similar
in
size
let
them
be
seen
together
at
some
distance
and
we
shall
pronounce
the
last
to
be
about
a
fifth
part
smaller
than
the
other
if
the
black
circle
be
made
larger
by
so
much
they
will
appear
equal
thus
tycho
de
brahe
remarked
that
the
moon
in
conjunction
the
darker
state
appears
about
a
fifth
part
smaller
than
when
in
opposition
the
bright
full
state
the
first
crescent
appears
to
belong
to
a
larger
disk
than
the
remaining
dark
portion
which
can
sometimes
be
distinguished
at
the
period
of
the
new
moon
black

illustration
black
as
the
equivalent
of
darkness
leaves
the
organ
in
a
state
of
repose
white
as
the
representative
of
light
excites
it
we
may
perhaps
conclude
from
the
above
experiment
that
the
unexcited
retina
if
left
to
itself
is
drawn
together
and
occupies
a
less
space
than
in
its
active
state
produced
by
the
excitement
of
light

a
however
this
may
be
both
impressions
derived
from
such
objects
remain
in
the
organ
itself
and
last
for
some
time
even
when
the
external
cause
is
removed
in
ordinary
experience
we
scarcely
notice
this
for
objects
are
seldom
presented
to
us
which
are
very
strongly
relieved
from
each
other
and
we
avoid
looking
at
those
appearances
that
dazzle
the
sight
in
glancing
from
one
object
to
another
the
succession
of
images
appears
to
us
distinct
we
are
not
aware
that
some
portion
of
the
impression
derived
from
the
object
first
contemplated
passes
to
that
which
is
next
looked
at
if
in
the
morning
on
waking
when
the
eye
is
very
susceptible
we
look
intently
at
the
bars
of
a
window
relieved
against
the
dawning
sky
and
then
shut
our
eyes
or
look
towards
a
totally
dark
place
we
shall
see
a
dark
cross
on
a
light
ground
before
us
for
some
time
every
image
occupies
a
certain
space
on
the
retina
and
of
course
a
greater
or
less
space
in
proportion
as
the
object
is
seen
near
or
at
a
distance
if
we
shut
the
eyes
immediately
after
looking
at
the
sun
we
shall
be
surprised
to
find
how
small
the
image
it
leaves
appears
if
on
the
other
hand
we
turn
the
open
eye
towards
the
side
of
a
room
and
consider
the
visionary
image
in
relation
to
other
objects
we
shall
always
see
it
larger
in
proportion
to
the
distance
of
the
surface
on
which
it
is
thrown
this
is
easily
explained
by
the
laws
of
perspective
according
to
which
a
small
object
near
covers
a
great
one
at
a
distance
the
duration
of
these
visionary
impressions
varies
with
the
powers
or
structure
of
the
eye
in
different
individuals
just
as
the
time
necessary
for
the
recovery
of
the
tone
of
the
retina
varies
in
passing
from
brightness
to
darkness
it
can
be
measured
by
minutes
and
seconds
indeed
much
more
exactly
than
it
could
formerly
have
been
by
causing
a
lighted
linstock
to
revolve
rapidly
so
as
to
appear
a
note
b
but
the
force
with
which
an
impinging
light
impresses
the
eye
is
especially
worthy
of
attention
the
image
of
the
sun
lasts
longest
other
objects
of
various
degrees
of
brightness
leave
the
traces
of
their
appearance
on
the
eye
for
a
proportionate
time
these
images
disappear
by
degrees
and
diminish
at
once
in
distinctness
and
in
size
they
are
reduced
from
the
contour
inwards
and
the
impression
on
some
persons
has
been
that
in
square
images
the
angles
become
gradually
blunted
till
at
last
a
diminished
round
image
floats
before
the
eye
such
an
image
when
its
impression
is
no
more
observable
can
immediately
after
be
again
revived
on
the
retina
by
opening
and
shutting
the
eye
thus
alternately
exciting
and
resting
it
images
may
remain
on
the
retina
in
morbid
affections
of
the
eye
for
fourteen
seventeen
minutes
or
even
longer
this
indicates
extreme
weakness
of
the
organ
its
inability
to
recover
itself
while
visions
of
persons
or
things
which
are
the
objects
of
love
or
aversion
indicate
the
connexion
between
sense
and
thought
if
while
the
image
of
the
before
mentioned
lasts
we
look
upon
a
light
grey
surface
the
cross
will
then
appear
light
and
the
panes
dark
in
the
first
case
the
image
was
like
the
original
picture
so
that
the
visionary
impression
also
could
continue
unchanged
but
in
the
present
instance
our
attention
is
excited
by
a
contrary
effect
being
produced
various
examples
have
been
given
by
observers
of
nature
the
scientific
men
who
made
observations
in
the
cordilleras
saw
a
bright
appearance
round
the
shadows
of
their
heads
on
some
clouds
this
example
is
a
case
in
point
for
while
they
fixed
their
eyes
on
the
dark
shadow
and
at
the
same
time
moved
from
the
spot
the
compensatory
light
image
appeared
to
float
round
the
real
dark
one
if
we
look
at
a
black
disk
on
a
light
grey
surface
we
shall
presently
by
changing
the
direction
of
the
eyes
in
the
slightest
degree
see
a
bright
halo
floating
round
the
dark
circle
a
similar
circumstance
happened
to
myself
for
while
as
i
sat
in
the
open
air
i
was
talking
to
a
man
who
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
me
relieved
on
a
grey
sky
it
appeared
to
me
as
i
slightly
altered
the
direction
of
my
eyes
after
having
for
some
time
looked
fixedly
at
him
that
his
head
was
encircled
with
a
dazzling
light
in
the
same
way
probably
might
be
explained
the
circumstance
that
persons
crossing
dewy
meadows
at
sunrise
see
a
brightness
round
each
other
heads
the
brightness
in
this
case
may
be
also
iridescent
as
the
phenomena
of
refraction
come
into
the
account
thus
again
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
shadows
of
a
balloon
thrown
on
clouds
were
bordered
with
bright
and
somewhat
variegated
circles
beccaria
made
use
of
a
paper
kite
in
some
experiments
on
electricity
round
this
kite
appeared
a
small
shining
cloud
varying
in
size
the
same
brightness
was
even
observed
round
part
of
the
string
sometimes
it
disappeared
and
if
the
kite
moved
faster
the
light
appeared
to
float
to
and
fro
for
a
few
moments
on
the
place
before
occupied
this
appearance
which
could
not
be
explained
by
those
who
observed
it
at
the
time
was
the
image
which
the
eye
retained
of
the
kite
relieved
as
a
dark
mass
on
a
bright
sky
that
image
being
changed
into
a
light
mass
on
a
comparatively
dark
background
in
optical
and
especially
in
chromatic
experiments
where
the
observer
has
to
do
with
bright
lights
whether
colourless
or
coloured
great
care
should
be
taken
that
the
spectrum
which
the
eye
retains
in
consequence
of
a
previous
observation
does
not
mix
with
the
succeeding
one
and
thus
affect
the
distinctness
and
purity
of
the
impression
these
appearances
have
been
explained
as
follows
that
portion
of
the
retina
on
which
the
dark
cross
was
impressed
is
to
be
considered
in
a
state
of
repose
and
susceptibility
on
this
portion
therefore
the
moderately
light
surface
acted
in
a
more
lively
manner
than
on
the
rest
of
the
retina
which
had
just
been
impressed
with
the
light
through
the
panes
and
which
having
thus
been
excited
by
a
much
stronger
brightness
could
only
view
the
grey
surface
as
a
dark
this
mode
of
explanation
appears
sufficient
for
the
cases
in
question
but
in
the
consideration
of
phenomena
hereafter
to
be
adduced
we
are
forced
to
trace
the
effects
to
higher
sources
the
eye
after
sleep
exhibits
its
vital
elasticity
more
especially
by
its
tendency
to
alternate
its
impressions
which
in
the
simplest
form
change
from
dark
to
light
and
from
light
to
dark
the
eye
can
not
for
a
moment
remain
in
a
particular
state
determined
by
the
object
it
looks
upon
on
the
contrary
it
is
forced
to
a
sort
of
opposition
which
in
contrasting
extreme
with
extreme
intermediate
degree
with
intermediate
degree
at
the
same
time
combines
these
opposite
impressions
and
thus
ever
tends
to
a
whole
whether
the
impressions
are
successive
or
simultaneous
and
confined
to
one
image
perhaps
the
peculiarly
grateful
sensation
which
we
experience
in
looking
at
the
skilfully
treated
of
colourless
pictures
and
similar
works
of
art
arises
chiefly
from
the
impression
of
a
whole
which
by
the
organ
itself
is
sought
rather
than
arrived
at
in
and
which
whatever
may
be
the
result
can
never
be
arrested

grey
surfaces
and
objects
a
moderate
light
is
essential
to
many
chromatic
experiments
this
can
be
presently
obtained
by
surfaces
more
or
less
grey
and
thus
we
have
at
once
to
make
ourselves
acquainted
with
this
simplest
kind
of
middle
tint
with
regard
to
which
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
observe
that
in
many
cases
a
white
surface
in
shadow
or
in
a
low
light
may
be
considered
equivalent
to
a
grey
since
a
grey
surface
is
intermediate
between
brightness
and
darkness
it
admits
of
our
illustrating
a
phenomenon
before
described
by
an
easy
experiment
let
a
black
object
be
held
before
a
grey
surface
and
let
the
spectator
after
looking
steadfastly
at
it
keep
his
eyes
unmoved
while
it
is
taken
away
the
space
it
occupied
appears
much
lighter
let
a
white
object
be
held
up
in
the
same
manner
on
taking
it
away
the
space
it
occupied
will
appear
much
darker
than
the
rest
of
the
surface
let
the
spectator
in
both
cases
turn
his
eyes
this
way
and
that
on
the
surface
the
visionary
images
will
move
in
like
manner
a
grey
object
on
a
black
ground
appears
much
brighter
than
the
same
object
on
a
white
ground
if
both
comparisons
are
seen
together
the
spectator
can
hardly
persuade
himself
that
the
two
greys
are
identical
we
believe
this
again
to
be
a
proof
of
the
great
excitability
of
the
retina
and
of
the
silent
resistance
which
every
vital
principle
is
forced
to
exhibit
when
any
definite
or
immutable
state
is
presented
to
it
thus
inspiration
already
presupposes
expiration
thus
every
systole
its
diastole
it
is
the
universal
formula
of
life
which
manifests
itself
in
this
as
in
all
other
cases
when
darkness
is
presented
to
the
eye
it
demands
brightness
and
it
shows
its
vital
energy
its
fitness
to
receive
the
impression
of
the
object
precisely
by
spontaneously
tending
to
an
opposite
state
iv
dazzling
colourless
objects
if
we
look
at
a
dazzling
altogether
colourless
object
it
makes
a
strong
lasting
impression
and
its
is
accompanied
by
an
appearance
of
colour
let
a
room
be
made
as
dark
as
possible
let
there
be
a
circular
opening
in
the
about
three
inches
in
diameter
which
may
be
closed
or
not
at
pleasure
the
sun
being
suffered
to
shine
through
this
on
a
white
surface
let
the
spectator
from
some
little
distance
fix
his
eyes
on
the
bright
circle
thus
admitted
the
hole
being
then
closed
let
him
look
towards
the
darkest
part
of
the
room
a
circular
image
will
now
be
seen
to
float
before
him
the
middle
of
this
circle
will
appear
bright
colourless
or
somewhat
yellow
but
the
border
will
at
the
same
moment
appear
red
after
a
time
this
red
increasing
towards
the
centre
covers
the
whole
circle
and
at
last
the
bright
central
point
no
sooner
however
is
the
whole
circle
red
than
the
edge
begins
to
be
blue
and
the
blue
gradually
encroaches
inwards
on
the
red
when
the
whole
is
blue
the
edge
becomes
dark
and
colourless
this
darker
edge
again
slowly
encroaches
on
the
blue
till
the
whole
circle
appears
colourless
the
image
then
becomes
gradually
fainter
and
at
the
same
time
diminishes
in
size
here
again
we
see
how
the
retina
recovers
itself
by
a
succession
of
vibrations
after
the
powerful
external
impression
it
received
by
several
repetitions
similar
in
result
i
found
the
comparative
duration
of
these
appearances
in
my
own
case
to
be
as
follows
i
looked
on
the
bright
circle
five
seconds
and
then
having
closed
the
aperture
saw
the
coloured
visionary
circle
floating
before
me
after
thirteen
seconds
it
was
altogether
red
seconds
next
elapsed
till
the
whole
was
blue
and
seconds
till
it
appeared
colourless
by
shutting
and
opening
the
eye
i
constantly
revived
the
image
so
that
it
did
not
quite
disappear
till
seven
minutes
had
elapsed
future
observers
may
find
these
periods
shorter
or
longer
as
their
eyes
may
be
stronger
or
weaker
but
it
would
be
very
remarkable
if
notwithstanding
such
variations
a
corresponding
proportion
as
to
relative
duration
should
be
found
to
exist
but
this
remarkable
phenomenon
no
sooner
excites
our
attention
than
we
observe
a
new
modification
of
it
if
we
receive
the
impression
of
the
bright
circle
as
before
and
then
look
on
a
light
grey
surface
in
a
moderately
lighted
room
an
image
again
floats
before
us
but
in
this
instance
a
dark
one
by
degrees
it
is
encircled
by
a
green
border
that
gradually
spreads
inwards
over
the
whole
circle
as
the
red
did
in
the
former
instance
as
soon
as
this
has
taken
place
a
dingy
yellow
appears
and
filling
the
space
as
the
blue
did
before
is
finally
lost
in
a
negative
shade
these
two
experiments
may
be
combined
by
placing
a
black
and
a
white
plane
surface
next
each
other
in
a
moderately
lighted
room
and
then
looking
alternately
on
one
and
the
other
as
long
as
the
impression
of
the
light
circle
lasts
the
spectator
will
then
perceive
at
first
a
red
and
green
image
alternately
and
afterwards
the
other
changes
after
a
little
practice
the
two
opposite
colours
may
be
perceived
at
once
by
causing
the
floating
image
to
fall
on
the
junction
of
the
two
planes
this
can
be
more
conveniently
done
if
the
planes
are
at
some
distance
for
the
spectrum
then
appears
larger
i
happened
to
be
in
a
forge
towards
evening
at
the
moment
when
a
glowing
mass
of
iron
was
placed
on
the
anvil
i
had
fixed
my
eyes
steadfastly
on
it
and
turning
round
i
looked
accidentally
into
an
open
a
large
red
image
now
floated
before
my
eyes
and
as
i
turned
them
from
the
dark
opening
to
the
light
boards
of
which
the
shed
was
constructed
the
image
appeared
half
green
half
red
according
as
it
had
a
lighter
or
darker
ground
behind
it
i
did
not
at
that
time
take
notice
of
the
subsequent
changes
of
this
appearance
the
occasioned
by
a
total
dazzling
of
the
retina
corresponds
with
that
of
a
circumscribed
bright
object
the
red
colour
seen
by
persons
who
are
dazzled
with
snow
belongs
to
this
class
of
phenomena
as
well
as
the
singularly
beautiful
green
colour
which
dark
objects
seem
to
wear
after
looking
long
on
white
paper
in
the
sun
the
details
of
such
experiments
may
be
investigated
hereafter
by
those
whose
young
eyes
are
capable
of
enduring
such
trials
further
for
the
sake
of
science
with
these
examples
we
may
also
class
the
black
letters
which
in
the
evening
light
appear
red
perhaps
we
might
insert
under
the
same
category
the
story
that
drops
of
blood
appeared
on
the
table
at
which
henry
iv
of
france
had
seated
himself
with
the
duc
de
guise
to
play
at
dice
coloured
objects
we
have
hitherto
seen
the
physiological
colours
displayed
in
the
of
colourless
bright
objects
and
also
in
the
of
general
colourless
brightness
we
shall
now
find
analogous
appearances
if
a
given
colour
be
presented
to
the
eye
in
considering
this
all
that
has
been
hitherto
detailed
must
be
present
to
our
recollection
the
impression
of
coloured
objects
remains
in
the
eye
like
that
of
colourless
ones
but
in
this
case
the
energy
of
the
retina
stimulated
as
it
is
to
produce
the
opposite
colour
will
be
more
apparent
let
a
small
piece
of
paper
or
silk
stuff
be
held
before
a
moderately
lighted
white
surface
let
the
observer
look
steadfastly
on
the
small
coloured
object
and
let
it
be
taken
away
after
a
time
while
his
eyes
remain
unmoved
the
spectrum
of
another
colour
will
then
be
visible
on
the
white
plane
the
coloured
paper
may
be
also
left
in
its
place
while
the
eye
is
directed
to
another
part
of
the
white
plane
the
same
spectrum
will
be
visible
there
too
for
it
arises
from
an
image
which
now
belongs
to
the
eye
in
order
at
once
to
see
what
colour
will
be
evoked
by
this
contrast
the
chromatic
circle
may
be
referred
to
the
colours
are
here
arranged
in
a
general
way
according
to
the
natural
order
and
the
arrangement
will
be
found
to
be
directly
applicable
in
the
present
case
for
the
colours
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other
in
this
diagram
are
those
which
reciprocally
evoke
each
other
in
the
eye
thus
yellow
demands
purple
orange
blue
red
green
and
thus
again
all
intermediate
gradations
reciprocally
evoke
each
other
the
simpler
colour
demanding
the
compound
and
note
the
cases
here
under
consideration
occur
oftener
than
we
are
aware
in
ordinary
life
indeed
an
attentive
observer
sees
these
appearances
everywhere
while
on
the
other
hand
the
uninstructed
like
our
predecessors
consider
them
as
temporary
visual
defects
sometimes
even
as
symptoms
of
disorders
in
the
eye
thus
exciting
serious
apprehensions
a
few
remarkable
instances
may
here
be
inserted
i
had
entered
an
inn
towards
evening
and
as
a
girl
with
a
brilliantly
fair
complexion
black
hair
and
a
scarlet
bodice
came
into
the
room
i
looked
attentively
at
her
as
she
stood
before
me
at
some
distance
in
half
shadow
as
she
presently
afterwards
turned
away
i
saw
on
the
white
wall
which
was
now
before
me
a
black
face
surrounded
with
a
bright
light
while
the
dress
of
the
perfectly
distinct
figure
appeared
of
a
beautiful
among
the
materials
for
optical
experiments
there
are
portraits
with
colours
and
shadows
exactly
opposite
to
the
appearance
of
nature
the
spectator
after
having
looked
at
one
of
these
for
a
time
will
see
the
visionary
figure
tolerably
true
to
nature
this
is
conformable
to
the
same
principles
and
consistent
with
experience
for
in
the
former
instance
a
negress
with
a
white
would
have
given
me
a
white
face
surrounded
with
black
in
the
case
of
the
painted
figures
however
which
are
commonly
small
the
parts
are
not
distinguishable
by
every
one
in
the
a
phenomenon
which
has
before
excited
attention
among
the
observers
of
nature
is
to
be
attributed
i
am
persuaded
to
the
same
cause
it
has
been
stated
that
certain
flowers
towards
evening
in
summer
coruscate
become
phosphorescent
or
emit
a
momentary
light
some
persons
have
described
their
observation
of
this
minutely
i
had
often
endeavoured
to
witness
it
myself
and
had
even
resorted
to
artificial
contrivances
to
produce
it
on
the
of
june
late
in
the
evening
when
the
twilight
was
deepening
into
a
clear
night
as
i
was
walking
up
and
down
the
garden
with
a
friend
we
very
distinctly
observed
a
appearance
near
the
oriental
poppy
the
flowers
of
which
are
remarkable
for
their
powerful
red
colour
we
approached
the
place
and
looked
attentively
at
the
flowers
but
could
perceive
nothing
further
till
at
last
by
passing
and
repassing
repeatedly
while
we
looked
sideways
on
them
we
succeeded
in
renewing
the
appearance
as
often
as
we
pleased
it
proved
to
be
a
physiological
phenomenon
such
as
others
we
have
described
and
the
apparent
coruscation
was
nothing
but
the
spectrum
of
the
flower
in
the
compensatory
colour
in
looking
directly
at
a
flower
the
image
is
not
produced
but
it
appears
immediately
as
the
direction
of
the
eye
is
altered
again
by
looking
sideways
on
the
object
a
double
image
is
seen
for
a
moment
for
the
spectrum
then
appears
near
and
on
the
real
object
the
twilight
accounts
for
the
eye
being
in
a
perfect
state
of
repose
and
thus
very
susceptible
and
the
colour
of
the
poppy
is
sufficiently
powerful
in
the
summer
twilight
of
the
longest
days
to
act
with
full
effect
and
produce
a
compensatory
image
i
have
no
doubt
these
appearances
might
be
reduced
to
experiment
and
the
same
effect
produced
by
pieces
of
coloured
paper
those
who
wish
to
take
the
most
effectual
means
for
observing
the
appearance
in
nature
suppose
in
a
garden
should
fix
the
eyes
on
the
bright
flowers
selected
for
the
purpose
and
immediately
after
look
on
the
gravel
path
this
will
be
seen
studded
with
spots
of
the
opposite
colour
the
experiment
is
practicable
on
a
cloudy
day
and
even
in
the
brightest
sunshine
for
the
by
enhancing
the
brilliancy
of
the
flower
renders
it
fit
to
produce
the
compensatory
colour
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
perceptible
even
in
a
bright
light
thus
peonies
produce
beautiful
green
marigolds
vivid
blue
spectra
as
the
opposite
colour
is
produced
by
a
constant
law
in
experiments
with
coloured
objects
on
portions
of
the
retina
so
the
same
effect
takes
place
when
the
whole
retina
is
impressed
with
a
single
colour
we
may
convince
ourselves
of
this
by
means
of
coloured
glasses
if
we
look
long
through
a
blue
pane
of
glass
everything
will
afterwards
appear
in
sunshine
to
the
naked
eye
even
if
the
sky
is
grey
and
the
scene
colourless
in
like
manner
in
taking
off
green
spectacles
we
see
all
objects
in
a
red
light
every
decided
colour
does
a
certain
violence
to
the
eye
and
forces
the
organ
to
opposition
we
have
hitherto
seen
the
opposite
colours
producing
each
other
successively
on
the
retina
it
now
remains
to
show
by
experiment
that
the
same
effects
can
exist
simultaneously
if
a
coloured
object
impinges
on
one
part
of
the
retina
the
remaining
portion
at
the
same
moment
has
a
tendency
to
produce
the
compensatory
colour
to
pursue
a
former
experiment
if
we
look
on
a
yellow
piece
of
paper
placed
on
a
white
surface
the
remaining
part
of
the
organ
has
already
a
tendency
to
produce
a
purple
hue
on
the
colourless
surface
in
this
case
the
small
portion
of
yellow
is
not
powerful
enough
to
produce
this
appearance
distinctly
but
if
a
white
paper
is
placed
on
a
yellow
wall
we
shall
see
the
white
tinged
with
a
purple
hue
although
this
experiment
may
be
made
with
any
colours
yet
red
and
green
are
particularly
recommended
for
it
because
these
colours
seem
powerfully
to
evoke
each
other
numerous
instances
occur
in
daily
experience
if
a
green
paper
is
seen
through
striped
or
flowered
muslin
the
stripes
or
flowers
will
appear
reddish
a
grey
building
seen
through
green
pallisades
appears
in
like
manner
reddish
a
modification
of
this
tint
in
the
agitated
sea
is
also
a
compensatory
colour
the
light
side
of
the
waves
appears
green
in
its
own
colour
and
the
shadowed
side
is
tinged
with
the
opposite
hue
the
different
direction
of
the
waves
with
reference
to
the
eye
produces
the
same
effect
objects
seen
through
an
opening
in
a
red
or
green
curtain
appear
to
wear
the
opposite
hue
these
appearances
will
present
themselves
to
the
attentive
observer
on
all
occasions
even
to
an
unpleasant
degree
having
made
ourselves
acquainted
with
the
simultaneous
exhibition
of
these
effects
in
direct
cases
we
shall
find
that
we
can
also
observe
them
by
indirect
means
if
we
place
a
piece
of
paper
of
a
bright
orange
colour
on
the
white
surface
we
shall
after
looking
intently
at
it
scarcely
perceive
the
compensatory
colour
on
the
rest
of
the
surface
but
when
we
take
the
orange
paper
away
and
when
the
blue
spectrum
appears
in
its
place
immediately
as
this
spectrum
becomes
fully
apparent
the
rest
of
the
surface
will
be
overspread
as
if
by
a
flash
with
a
light
thus
exhibiting
to
the
spectator
in
a
lively
manner
the
productive
energy
of
the
organ
in
constant
conformity
with
the
same
law
as
the
compensatory
colours
easily
appear
where
they
do
not
exist
in
nature
near
and
after
the
original
opposite
ones
so
they
are
rendered
more
intense
where
they
happen
to
mix
with
a
similar
real
hue
in
a
court
which
was
paved
with
grey
limestone
flags
between
which
grass
had
grown
the
grass
appeared
of
an
extremely
beautiful
green
when
the
evening
clouds
threw
a
scarcely
perceptible
reddish
light
on
the
pavement
in
an
opposite
case
we
find
in
walking
through
meadows
where
we
see
scarcely
anything
but
green
the
stems
of
trees
and
the
roads
often
gleam
with
a
reddish
hue
this
tone
is
not
uncommon
in
the
works
of
landscape
painters
especially
those
who
practice
in
they
probably
see
it
in
nature
and
thus
unconsciously
imitating
it
their
colouring
is
criticised
as
unnatural
these
phenomena
are
of
the
greatest
importance
since
they
direct
our
attention
to
the
laws
of
vision
and
are
a
necessary
preparation
for
future
observations
on
colours
they
show
that
the
eye
especially
demands
completeness
and
seeks
to
eke
out
the
colorific
circle
in
itself
the
purple
or
violet
colour
suggested
by
yellow
contains
red
and
blue
orange
which
responds
to
blue
is
composed
of
yellow
and
red
green
uniting
blue
and
yellow
demands
red
and
so
through
all
gradations
of
the
most
complicated
combinations
that
we
are
compelled
in
this
case
to
assume
three
leading
colours
has
been
already
remarked
by
other
observers
when
in
this
completeness
the
elements
of
which
it
is
composed
are
still
appreciable
by
the
eye
the
result
is
justly
called
harmony
we
shall
subsequently
endeavour
to
show
how
the
theory
of
the
harmony
of
colours
may
be
deduced
from
these
phenomena
and
how
simply
through
these
qualities
colours
may
be
capable
of
being
applied
to
æsthetic
purposes
this
will
be
shown
when
we
have
gone
through
the
whole
circle
of
our
observations
returning
to
the
point
from
which
we
started
plate
fig
vi
coloured
shadows
before
however
we
proceed
further
we
have
yet
to
observe
some
very
remarkable
cases
of
the
vivacity
with
which
the
suggested
colours
appear
in
the
neighbourhood
of
others
we
allude
to
coloured
shadows
to
arrive
at
these
we
first
turn
our
attention
to
shadows
that
are
colourless
or
negative
a
shadow
cast
by
the
sun
in
its
full
brightness
on
a
white
surface
gives
us
no
impression
of
colour
it
appears
black
or
if
a
contrary
light
here
assumed
to
differ
only
in
degree
can
act
upon
it
it
is
only
weaker
grey
two
conditions
are
necessary
for
the
existence
of
coloured
shadows
first
that
the
principal
light
tinge
the
white
surface
with
some
hue
secondly
that
a
contrary
light
illumine
to
a
certain
extent
the
cast
shadow
let
a
short
lighted
candle
be
placed
at
twilight
on
a
sheet
of
white
paper
between
it
and
the
declining
daylight
let
a
pencil
be
placed
upright
so
that
its
shadow
thrown
by
the
candle
may
be
lighted
but
not
overcome
by
the
weak
daylight
the
shadow
will
appear
of
the
most
beautiful
blue
that
this
shadow
is
blue
is
immediately
evident
but
we
can
only
persuade
ourselves
by
some
attention
that
the
white
paper
acts
as
a
reddish
yellow
by
means
of
which
the
complemental
blue
is
excited
in
the
note
in
all
coloured
shadows
therefore
we
must
presuppose
a
colour
excited
or
suggested
by
the
hue
of
the
surface
on
which
the
shadow
is
thrown
this
may
be
easily
found
to
be
the
case
by
attentive
consideration
but
we
may
convince
ourselves
at
once
by
the
following
experiment
place
two
candles
at
night
opposite
each
other
on
a
white
surface
hold
a
thin
rod
between
them
upright
so
that
two
shadows
be
cast
by
it
take
a
coloured
glass
and
hold
it
before
one
of
the
lights
so
that
the
white
paper
appear
coloured
at
the
same
moment
the
shadow
cast
by
the
coloured
light
and
slightly
illumined
by
the
colourless
one
will
exhibit
the
complemental
hue
an
important
consideration
suggests
itself
here
to
which
we
shall
frequently
have
occasion
to
return
colour
itself
is
a
degree
of
darkness
hence
kircher
is
perfectly
right
in
calling
it
as
it
is
allied
to
shadow
so
it
combines
readily
with
it
it
appears
to
us
readily
in
and
by
means
of
shadow
the
moment
a
suggesting
cause
presents
itself
we
could
not
refrain
from
adverting
at
once
to
a
fact
which
we
propose
to
trace
and
develop
note
select
the
moment
in
twilight
when
the
light
of
the
sky
is
still
powerful
enough
to
cast
a
shadow
which
can
not
be
entirely
effaced
by
the
light
of
a
candle
the
candle
may
be
so
placed
that
a
double
shadow
shall
be
visible
one
from
the
candle
towards
the
daylight
and
another
from
the
daylight
towards
the
candle
if
the
former
is
blue
the
latter
will
appear
this
is
in
fact
however
only
the
light
of
the
candle
diffused
over
the
whole
paper
and
which
visible
in
this
is
best
exemplified
by
the
former
experiment
with
two
candles
and
coloured
glasses
the
surprising
readiness
with
which
shadow
assumes
a
colour
will
again
invite
our
attention
in
the
further
consideration
of
reflections
and
elsewhere
thus
the
phenomena
of
coloured
shadows
may
be
traced
to
their
cause
without
difficulty
henceforth
let
any
one
who
sees
an
instance
of
the
kind
observe
only
with
what
hue
the
light
surface
on
which
they
are
thrown
is
tinged
nay
the
colour
of
the
shadow
may
be
considered
as
a
chromatoscope
of
the
illumined
surface
for
the
spectator
may
always
assume
the
colour
of
the
light
to
be
the
opposite
of
that
of
the
shadow
and
by
an
attentive
examination
may
ascertain
this
to
be
the
fact
in
every
instance
these
appearances
have
been
a
source
of
great
perplexity
to
former
observers
for
as
they
were
remarked
chiefly
in
the
open
air
where
they
commonly
appeared
blue
they
were
attributed
to
a
certain
inherent
blue
or
blue
colouring
quality
in
the
air
the
inquirer
can
however
convince
himself
by
the
experiment
with
the
candle
in
a
room
that
no
kind
of
blue
light
or
reflection
is
necessary
to
produce
the
effect
in
question
the
experiment
may
be
made
on
a
cloudy
day
with
white
curtains
drawn
before
the
light
and
in
a
room
where
no
trace
of
blue
exists
and
the
blue
shadow
will
be
only
so
much
the
more
beautiful
de
saussure
in
the
description
of
his
ascent
of
mont
blanc
says
a
second
remark
which
may
not
be
uninteresting
relates
to
the
colour
of
the
shadows
these
notwithstanding
the
most
attentive
observation
we
never
found
dark
blue
although
this
had
been
frequently
the
case
in
the
plain
on
the
contrary
in
instances
we
saw
them
once
yellowish
six
times
pale
bluish
eighteen
times
colourless
or
black
and
times
pale
violet
some
natural
philosophers
suppose
that
these
colours
arise
from
accidental
vapours
diffused
in
the
air
which
communicate
their
own
hues
to
the
shadows
not
that
the
colours
of
the
shadows
are
occasioned
by
the
reflection
of
any
given
sky
colour
or
interposition
of
any
given
air
colour
the
above
observations
seem
to
favour
this
opinion
the
instances
given
by
de
saussure
may
be
now
explained
and
classed
with
analogous
examples
without
difficulty
at
a
great
elevation
the
sky
was
generally
free
from
vapours
the
sun
shone
in
full
force
on
the
snow
so
that
it
appeared
perfectly
white
to
the
eye
in
this
case
they
saw
the
shadows
quite
colourless
if
the
air
was
charged
with
a
certain
degree
of
vapour
in
consequence
of
which
the
light
snow
would
assume
a
yellowish
tone
the
shadows
were
and
this
effect
it
appears
occurred
oftenest
they
saw
also
bluish
shadows
but
this
happened
less
frequently
and
that
the
blue
and
violet
were
pale
was
owing
to
the
surrounding
brightness
by
which
the
strength
of
the
shadows
was
mitigated
once
only
they
saw
the
shadow
yellowish
in
this
case
as
we
have
already
seen
the
shadow
is
cast
by
a
colourless
light
and
slightly
illumined
by
a
coloured
one
in
travelling
over
the
harz
in
winter
i
happened
to
descend
from
the
brocken
towards
evening
the
wide
slopes
extending
above
and
below
me
the
heath
every
insulated
tree
and
projecting
rock
and
all
masses
of
both
were
covered
with
snow
or
the
sun
was
sinking
towards
the
oder
ponds
during
the
day
owing
to
the
yellowish
hue
of
the
snow
shadows
tending
to
violet
had
already
been
observable
these
might
now
be
pronounced
to
be
decidedly
blue
as
the
illumined
parts
exhibited
a
yellow
deepening
to
orange
but
as
the
sun
at
last
was
about
to
set
and
its
rays
greatly
mitigated
by
the
thicker
vapours
began
to
diffuse
a
most
beautiful
red
colour
over
the
whole
scene
around
me
the
shadow
colour
changed
to
a
green
in
lightness
to
be
compared
to
a
in
beauty
to
the
green
of
the
emerald
the
appearance
became
more
and
more
vivid
one
might
have
imagined
oneself
in
a
fairy
world
for
every
object
had
clothed
itself
in
the
two
vivid
and
so
beautifully
harmonising
colours
till
at
last
as
the
sun
went
down
the
magnificent
spectacle
was
lost
in
a
grey
twilight
and
by
degrees
in
a
clear
night
one
of
the
most
beautiful
instances
of
coloured
shadows
may
be
observed
during
the
full
moon
the
and
may
be
contrived
to
be
exactly
equal
in
force
both
shadows
may
be
exhibited
with
equal
strength
and
clearness
so
that
both
colours
balance
each
other
perfectly
a
white
surface
being
placed
opposite
the
full
moon
and
the
candle
being
placed
a
little
on
one
side
at
a
due
distance
an
opaque
body
is
held
before
the
white
plane
a
double
shadow
will
then
be
seen
that
cast
by
the
moon
and
illumined
by
the
will
be
a
powerful
and
contrariwise
that
cast
by
the
candle
and
illumined
by
the
moon
will
appear
of
the
most
beautiful
blue
the
shadow
composed
of
the
union
of
the
two
shadows
where
they
cross
each
other
is
black
the
yellow
shadow
can
not
perhaps
be
exhibited
in
a
more
striking
manner
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
blue
and
the
interposing
black
shadow
make
the
appearance
the
more
agreeable
it
will
even
be
found
if
the
eye
dwells
long
on
these
colours
that
they
mutually
evoke
and
enhance
each
other
the
increasing
red
in
the
one
still
producing
its
contrast
viz
a
kind
of
we
are
here
led
to
remark
that
in
this
and
in
all
cases
a
moment
or
two
may
perhaps
be
necessary
to
produce
the
complemental
colour
the
retina
must
be
first
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
demanding
hue
before
the
responding
one
can
be
distinctly
observable
when
divers
are
under
water
and
the
sunlight
shines
into
the
everything
is
seen
in
a
red
light
the
cause
of
which
will
be
explained
hereafter
while
the
shadows
appear
green
the
very
same
phenomenon
which
i
observed
on
a
high
mountain
is
presented
to
others
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
thus
nature
throughout
is
in
harmony
with
herself
some
observations
and
experiments
which
equally
illustrate
what
has
been
stated
with
regard
to
coloured
objects
and
coloured
shadows
may
be
here
added
let
a
white
paper
blind
be
fastened
inside
the
window
on
a
winter
evening
in
this
blind
let
there
be
an
opening
through
which
the
snow
of
some
neighbouring
roof
can
be
seen
towards
dusk
let
a
candle
be
brought
into
the
room
the
snow
seen
through
the
opening
will
then
appear
perfectly
blue
because
the
paper
is
tinged
with
warm
yellow
by
the
the
snow
seen
through
the
aperture
is
here
equivalent
to
a
shadow
illumined
by
a
contrary
light
and
may
also
represent
a
grey
disk
on
a
coloured
surface
another
very
interesting
experiment
may
conclude
these
examples
if
we
take
a
piece
of
green
glass
of
some
thickness
and
hold
it
so
that
the
window
bars
be
reflected
in
it
they
will
appear
double
owing
to
the
thickness
of
the
glass
the
image
which
is
reflected
from
the
under
surface
of
the
glass
will
be
green
the
image
which
is
reflected
from
the
upper
surface
and
which
should
be
colourless
will
appear
red
the
experiment
may
be
very
satisfactorily
made
by
pouring
water
into
a
vessel
the
inner
surface
of
which
can
act
as
a
mirror
for
both
reflections
may
first
be
seen
colourless
while
the
water
is
pure
and
then
by
tinging
it
they
will
exhibit
two
opposite
hues
reservoirs
in
which
water
is
collected
from
various
small
streams
to
work
the
t
vii
faint

light
in
its
full
force
appears
purely
white
and
it
gives
this
impression
also
in
its
highest
degree
of
dazzling
splendour
light
which
is
not
so
powerful
can
also
under
various
conditions
remain
colourless
several
naturalists
and
mathematicians
have
endeavoured
to
measure
its
degrees
lambert
bouguer
rumford
yet
an
appearance
of
colour
presently
manifests
itself
in
fainter
lights
for
in
their
relation
to
absolute
light
they
resemble
the
coloured
spectra
of
dazzling
objects
a
light
of
any
kind
becomes
weaker
either
when
its
own
force
from
whatever
cause
is
diminished
or
when
the
eye
is
so
circumstanced
or
placed
that
it
can
not
be
sufficiently
impressed
by
the
action
of
the
light
those
appearances
which
may
be
called
objective
come
under
the
head
of
physical
colours
we
will
only
advert
here
to
the
transition
from
white
to
red
heat
in
glowing
iron
we
may
also
observe
that
the
flames
of
lights
at
night
appear
redder
in
proportion
to
their
distance
from
the
note
at
night
acts
as
yellow
when
seen
near
we
can
perceive
this
by
the
effect
it
produces
on
other
colours
at
night
a
pale
yellow
is
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
white
blue
approaches
to
green
and
to
orange
at
twilight
acts
powerfully
as
a
yellow
light
this
is
best
proved
by
the
purple
blue
shadows
which
under
these
circumstances
are
evoked
by
the
eye
the
retina
may
be
so
excited
by
a
strong
light
that
it
can
not
perceive
fainter
lights
if
it
perceive
these
they
appear
coloured
hence
by
day
appears
reddish
thus
resembling
in
its
relation
to
fuller
light
the
spectrum
of
a
dazzling
object
nay
if
at
night
we
look
long
and
intently
on
the
flame
of
a
light
it
appears
to
increase
in
redness
there
are
faint
lights
which
notwithstanding
their
moderate
lustre
give
an
impression
of
a
white
or
at
the
most
of
a
light
yellow
appearance
on
the
retina
such
as
the
moon
in
its
full
splendour
rotten
wood
has
even
a
kind
of
bluish
light
all
this
will
hereafter
be
the
subject
of
further
remarks
if
at
night
we
place
a
light
near
a
white
or
greyish
wall
so
that
the
surface
be
illumined
from
this
central
point
to
some
extent
we
find
on
observing
the
spreading
light
at
some
distance
that
the
boundary
of
the
illumined
surface
appears
to
be
surrounded
with
a
yellow
circle
which
on
the
outside
tends
to
we
thus
observe
that
when
light
direct
or
reflected
does
not
act
in
its
full
force
it
gives
an
impression
of
yellow
of
reddish
and
lastly
even
of
red
here
we
find
the
transition
to
halos
which
we
are
accustomed
to
see
in
some
mode
or
other
round
luminous
points
viii
subjective
halos
halos
may
be
divided
into
subjective
and
objective
the
latter
will
be
considered
under
the
physical
colours
the
first
only
belong
here
these
are
distinguished
from
the
objective
halos
by
the
circumstance
of
their
vanishing
when
the
point
of
light
which
produces
them
on
the
retina
is
covered
we
have
before
noticed
the
impression
of
a
luminous
object
on
the
retina
and
seen
that
it
appears
larger
but
the
effect
is
not
at
an
end
here
it
is
not
confined
to
the
impression
of
the
image
an
expansive
action
also
takes
place
spreading
from
the
centre
that
a
nimbus
of
this
kind
is
produced
round
the
luminous
image
in
the
eye
may
be
best
seen
in
a
dark
room
if
we
look
towards
a
moderately
large
opening
in
the
in
this
case
the
bright
image
is
surrounded
by
a
circular
misty
light
i
saw
such
a
halo
bounded
by
a
yellow
and
circle
on
opening
my
eyes
at
dawn
on
an
occasion
when
i
passed
several
nights
in
a
halos
appear
most
vivid
when
the
eye
is
susceptible
from
having
been
in
a
state
of
repose
a
dark
background
also
heightens
their
appearance
both
causes
account
for
our
seeing
them
so
strong
if
a
light
is
presented
to
the
eyes
on
waking
at
night
these
conditions
were
combined
when
descartes
after
sleeping
as
he
sat
in
a
ship
remarked
such
a
halo
round
the
light
a
light
must
shine
moderately
not
dazzle
in
order
to
produce
the
impression
of
a
halo
in
the
eye
at
all
events
the
halos
of
dazzling
lights
can
not
be
observed
we
see
a
splendour
of
this
kind
round
the
image
of
the
sun
reflected
from
the
surface
of
water
a
halo
of
this
description
attentively
observed
is
found
to
be
encircled
towards
its
edge
with
a
yellow
border
but
even
here
the
expansive
action
before
alluded
to
is
not
at
an
end
but
appears
still
to
extend
in
varied
circles
several
cases
seem
to
indicate
a
circular
action
of
the
retina
whether
owing
to
the
round
form
of
the
eye
itself
and
its
different
parts
or
to
some
other
cause
if
the
eye
is
pressed
only
in
a
slight
degree
from
the
inner
corner
darker
or
lighter
circles
appear
at
night
even
without
pressure
we
can
sometimes
perceive
a
succession
of
such
circles
emerging
from
or
spreading
over
each
other
we
have
already
seen
that
a
yellow
border
is
apparent
round
the
white
space
illumined
by
a
light
placed
near
it
this
may
be
a
kind
of
objective
halo
subjective
halos
may
be
considered
as
the
result
of
a
conflict
between
the
light
and
a
living
surface
from
the
conflict
between
the
exciting
principle
and
the
excited
an
undulating
motion
arises
which
may
be
illustrated
by
a
comparison
with
the
circles
on
water
the
stone
thrown
in
drives
the
water
in
all
directions
the
effect
attains
a
maximum
it
reacts
and
being
opposed
continues
under
the
surface
the
effect
goes
on
culminates
again
and
thus
the
circles
are
repeated
if
we
have
ever
remarked
the
concentric
rings
which
appear
in
a
glass
of
water
on
trying
to
produce
a
tone
by
rubbing
the
edge
if
we
call
to
mind
the
intermitting
pulsations
in
the
reverberations
of
bells
we
shall
approach
a
conception
of
what
may
take
place
on
the
retina
when
the
image
of
a
luminous
object
impinges
on
it
not
to
mention
that
as
a
living
and
elastic
structure
it
has
already
a
circular
principle
in
its
note
the
bright
circular
space
which
appears
round
the
shining
object
is
yellow
ending
in
red
then
follows
a
greenish
circle
which
is
terminated
by
a
red
border
this
appears
to
be
the
usual
phenomenon
where
the
luminous
body
is
somewhat
considerable
in
size
these
halos
become
greater
the
more
distant
we
are
from
the
luminous
object
halos
may
however
appear
extremely
small
and
numerous
when
the
impinging
image
is
minute
yet
powerful
in
its
effect
the
experiment
is
best
made
with
a
piece
of
placed
on
the
ground
and
illumined
by
the
sun
in
these
cases
the
halos
appear
in
variegated
rays
the
iridescent
appearance
produced
in
the
eye
when
the
sun
pierces
through
the
leaves
of
trees
seems
also
to
belong
to
the
same
class
of
phenomena
pathological
colours
appendix
we
are
now
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
physiological
colours
to
distinguish
them
from
the
pathological
we
know
what
appearances
belong
to
the
eye
in
a
healthy
state
and
are
necessary
to
enable
the
organ
to
exert
its
complete
vitality
and
activity
morbid
phenomena
indicate
in
like
manner
the
existence
of
organic
and
physical
laws
for
if
a
living
being
deviates
from
those
rules
with
reference
to
which
it
is
constructed
it
still
seeks
to
agree
with
the
general
vitality
of
nature
in
conformity
with
general
laws
and
throughout
its
whole
course
still
proves
the
constancy
of
those
principles
on
which
the
universe
has
existed
and
by
which
it
is
held
together
we
will
here
first
advert
to
a
very
remarkable
state
in
which
the
vision
of
many
persons
is
found
to
be
as
it
presents
a
deviation
from
the
ordinary
mode
of
seeing
colours
it
might
be
fairly
classed
under
morbid
impressions
but
as
it
is
consistent
in
itself
as
it
often
occurs
may
extend
to
several
members
of
a
family
and
probably
does
not
admit
of
cure
we
may
consider
it
as
bordering
only
on
the
nosological
cases
and
therefore
place
it
first
i
was
acquainted
with
two
individuals
not
more
than
twenty
years
of
age
who
were
thus
affected
both
had
eyes
an
acute
sight
for
near
and
distant
objects
by
and
and
their
mode
of
seeing
colours
was
in
the
main
quite
similar
they
agreed
with
the
rest
of
the
world
in
denominating
white
black
and
grey
in
the
usual
manner
both
saw
white
untinged
with
any
hue
one
saw
a
somewhat
brownish
appearance
in
black
and
in
grey
a
somewhat
reddish
tinge
in
general
they
appeared
to
have
a
very
delicate
perception
of
the
gradations
of
light
and
dark
they
appeared
to
see
yellow
and
like
others
in
the
last
case
they
said
they
saw
the
yellow
passing
as
it
were
over
the
red
as
if
glazed
some
carmine
which
had
dried
in
a
saucer
they
called
red
but
now
a
striking
difference
presented
itself
if
the
carmine
was
passed
thinly
over
the
white
saucer
they
would
compare
the
light
colour
thus
produced
to
the
colour
of
the
sky
and
call
it
blue
if
a
rose
was
shown
them
beside
it
they
would
in
like
manner
call
it
blue
and
in
all
the
trials
which
were
made
it
appeared
that
they
could
not
distinguish
light
blue
from
they
confounded
blue
and
violet
on
all
occasions
these
colours
only
appeared
to
them
to
be
distinguished
from
each
other
by
delicate
shades
of
lighter
darker
intenser
or
fainter
appearance
again
they
could
not
distinguish
green
from
dark
orange
nor
more
especially
from
a
red
brown
if
any
one
accidentally
conversing
with
these
individuals
happened
to
question
them
about
surrounding
objects
their
answers
occasioned
the
greatest
perplexity
and
the
interrogator
began
to
fancy
his
own
wits
were
out
of
order
with
some
method
we
may
however
approach
to
a
nearer
knowledge
of
the
law
of
this
deviation
from
the
general
law
these
persons
as
may
be
gathered
from
what
has
been
stated
saw
fewer
colours
than
other
people
hence
arose
the
confusion
of
different
colours
they
called
the
sky
and
the
rose
blue
or
the
question
now
is
did
they
see
both
blue
or
both
did
they
see
green
orange
or
orange
green
this
singular
enigma
appears
to
solve
itself
if
we
assume
that
they
saw
no
blue
but
instead
of
it
a
light
pure
red
a
we
can
comprehend
what
would
be
the
result
of
this
by
means
of
the
chromatic
diagram
if
we
take
away
blue
from
the
chromatic
circle
we
shall
miss
violet
and
green
as
well
pure
red
occupies
the
place
of
blue
and
violet
and
in
again
mixing
with
yellow
the
red
produces
orange
where
green
should
be
professing
to
be
satisfied
with
this
mode
of
explanation
we
have
named
this
remarkable
deviation
from
ordinary
vision
acyanoblepsia
we
have
prepared
some
coloured
figures
for
its
further
elucidation
and
in
explaining
these
we
shall
add
some
further
details
among
the
examples
will
be
found
a
landscape
coloured
in
the
mode
in
which
the
individuals
alluded
to
appeared
to
see
nature
the
sky
and
all
that
should
be
green
varying
from
yellow
to
brown
red
nearly
as
foliage
appears
to
us
in
autumn
note
we
now
proceed
to
speak
of
morbid
and
other
extraordinary
affections
of
the
retina
by
which
the
eye
may
be
susceptible
of
an
appearance
of
light
without
external
light
reserving
for
a
future
occasion
the
consideration
of
galvanic
light
if
the
eye
receives
a
blow
sparks
seem
to
spread
from
it
in
some
states
of
body
again
when
the
blood
is
heated
and
the
system
much
excited
if
the
eye
is
pressed
first
gently
and
then
more
and
more
strongly
a
dazzling
and
intolerable
light
may
be
excited
if
those
who
have
been
recently
couched
experience
pain
and
heat
in
the
eye
they
frequently
see
fiery
flashes
and
sparks
these
symptoms
last
sometimes
for
a
week
or
fortnight
or
till
the
pain
and
heat
diminish
a
person
suffering
from
saw
sparks
and
balls
of
light
in
the
eye
during
each
attack
as
long
as
the
pain
lasted
persons
suffering
from
worms
often
experience
extraordinary
appearances
in
the
eye
sometimes
sparks
of
fire
sometimes
spectres
of
light
sometimes
frightful
figures
which
they
can
not
by
an
effort
of
the
will
cease
to
see
sometimes
these
appearances
are
double
hypochondriacs
frequently
see
dark
objects
such
as
threads
hairs
spiders
flies
wasps
these
appearances
also
exhibit
themselves
in
the
incipient
hard
cataract
many
see
small
tubes
forms
like
wings
of
insects
bubbles
of
water
of
various
sizes
which
fall
slowly
down
if
the
eye
is
raised
sometimes
these
congregate
together
so
as
to
resemble
the
spawn
of
frogs
sometimes
they
appear
as
complete
spheres
sometimes
in
the
form
of
lenses
as
light
appeared
in
the
former
instances
without
external
light
so
also
these
images
appear
without
corresponding
external
objects
the
images
are
sometimes
transient
sometimes
they
last
during
the
patient
life
colour
again
frequently
accompanies
these
impressions
for
hypochondriacs
often
see
stripes
in
the
eye
these
are
generally
more
vivid
and
numerous
in
the
morning
or
when
lasting
we
have
before
seen
that
the
impression
of
any
object
may
remain
for
a
time
in
the
eye
this
we
have
found
to
be
a
physiological
phenomenon
the
excessive
duration
of
such
an
impression
on
the
other
band
may
be
considered
as
morbid
the
weaker
the
organ
the
longer
the
impression
of
the
image
lasts
the
retina
does
not
so
soon
recover
itself
and
the
effect
may
be
considered
as
a
kind
of
paralysis
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
in
the
case
of
dazzling
lights
if
any
one
looks
at
the
sun
he
may
retain
the
image
in
his
eyes
for
several
days
boyle
relates
an
instance
of
ten
years
the
same
takes
place
in
a
certain
degree
with
regard
to
objects
that
are
not
dazzling
büsch
relates
of
himself
that
the
image
of
an
engraving
complete
in
all
its
parts
was
impressed
on
his
eye
for
seventeen
minutes
a
person
inclined
to
fulness
of
blood
retained
the
image
of
a
bright
red
calico
with
white
spots
many
minutes
in
the
eye
and
saw
it
float
before
everything
like
a
veil
it
only
disappeared
by
rubbing
the
eye
for
some
time
scherfer
observes
that
the
red
colour
which
is
the
consequence
of
a
powerful
impression
of
light
may
last
for
some
hours
as
we
can
produce
an
appearance
of
light
on
the
retina
by
pressure
on
the
eyeball
so
by
a
gentle
pressure
a
red
colour
appears
thus
corresponding
with
the
of
an
impression
of
light
many
sick
persons
on
awaking
see
everything
in
the
colour
of
the
morning
sky
as
if
through
a
red
veil
so
if
in
the
evening
they
doze
and
wake
again
the
same
appearance
presents
itself
it
remains
for
some
minutes
and
always
disappears
if
the
eye
is
rubbed
a
little
red
stars
and
balls
sometimes
accompany
the
impression
this
state
may
last
for
a
considerable
time
the
aëronauts
particularly
zambeccari
and
his
companions
relate
that
they
saw
the
moon
at
the
highest
elevation
as
they
had
ascended
above
the
vapours
of
the
earth
through
which
we
see
the
moon
and
sun
naturally
of
such
a
colour
it
may
be
suspected
that
this
appearance
may
be
classed
with
the
pathological
colours
the
senses
namely
may
be
so
influenced
by
an
unusual
state
that
the
whole
nervous
system
and
particularly
the
retina
may
sink
into
a
kind
of
inertness
and
inexcitability
hence
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
moon
might
act
as
a
very
subdued
light
and
thus
produce
the
impression
of
the
red
colour
the
sun
even
appeared
to
the
aëronauts
of
hamburgh
if
those
who
are
at
some
elevation
in
a
balloon
scarcely
hear
each
other
speak
may
not
this
too
be
attributed
to
the
inexcitable
state
of
the
nerves
as
well
as
to
the
thinness
of
the
air
objects
are
often
seen
by
sick
persons
in
variegated
colours
boyle
relates
an
instance
of
a
lady
who
after
a
fall
by
which
an
eye
was
bruised
saw
all
objects
but
especially
white
objects
glittering
in
colours
even
to
an
intolerable
degree
physicians
give
the
name
of
chrupsia
to
an
affection
of
the
sight
occurring
in
typhoid
maladies
in
these
cases
the
patients
state
that
they
see
the
boundaries
of
objects
coloured
where
light
and
dark
meet
a
change
probably
takes
place
in
the
humours
of
the
eye
through
which
their
achromatism
is
affected
in
cases
of
milky
cataract
a
very
turbid
crystalline
lens
causes
the
patient
to
see
a
red
light
in
a
case
of
this
kind
which
was
treated
by
the
application
of
electricity
the
red
light
changed
by
degrees
to
yellow
and
at
last
to
white
when
the
patient
again
began
to
distinguish
objects
these
changes
of
themselves
warranted
the
conclusion
that
the
turbid
state
of
the
lens
was
gradually
approaching
the
transparent
state
we
shall
be
enabled
easily
to
trace
this
effect
to
its
source
as
soon
as
we
become
better
acquainted
with
the
physical
colours
if
again
it
may
be
assumed
that
a
jaundiced
patient
sees
through
an
actually
humour
we
are
at
once
referred
to
the
department
of
chemical
colours
and
it
is
thus
evident
that
we
can
only
thoroughly
investigate
the
chapter
of
pathological
colours
when
we
have
made
ourselves
acquainted
with
the
whole
range
of
the
remaining
phenomena
what
has
been
adduced
may
therefore
suffice
for
the
present
till
we
resume
the
further
consideration
of
this
portion
of
our
subject
in
conclusion
we
may
however
at
once
advert
to
some
peculiar
states
or
dispositions
of
the
organ
there
are
painters
who
instead
of
rendering
the
colours
of
nature
diffuse
a
general
tone
a
warm
or
cold
hue
over
the
picture
in
some
again
a
predilection
for
certain
colours
displays
itself
in
others
a
want
of
feeling
for
harmony
lastly
it
is
also
worthy
of
remark
that
savage
nations
uneducated
people
and
children
have
a
great
predilection
for
vivid
colours
that
animals
are
excited
to
rage
by
certain
colours
that
people
of
refinement
avoid
vivid
colours
in
their
dress
and
the
objects
that
are
about
them
and
seem
inclined
to
banish
them
altogether
from
their
note
i
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
follow
the
author
nomenclature
throughout
of
blue
it
has
not
been
thought
necessary
to
copy
the
plates
here
referred
t
part
ii
physical
colours
we
give
this
designation
to
colours
which
are
produced
by
certain
material
mediums
these
mediums
however
have
no
colour
themselves
and
may
be
either
transparent
yet
transmitting
light
or
altogether
opaque
the
colours
in
question
are
thus
produced
in
the
eye
through
such
external
given
causes
or
are
merely
reflected
to
the
eye
when
by
whatever
means
they
are
already
produced
without
us
although
we
thus
ascribe
to
them
a
certain
objective
character
their
distinctive
quality
still
consists
in
their
being
transient
and
not
to
be
arrested
they
are
called
by
former
investigators
apparentes
fluxi
fugitivi
phantastici
falsi
they
are
also
called
and
on
account
of
their
striking
splendour
they
are
immediately
connected
with
the
physiological
colours
and
appear
to
have
but
little
more
reality
for
while
in
the
production
of
the
physiological
colours
the
eye
itself
was
chiefly
efficient
and
we
could
only
perceive
the
phenomena
thus
evoked
within
ourselves
but
not
without
us
we
have
now
to
consider
the
fact
that
colours
are
produced
in
the
eye
by
means
of
colourless
objects
that
we
thus
too
have
a
colourless
surface
before
us
which
is
acted
upon
as
the
retina
itself
is
and
that
we
can
perceive
the
appearance
produced
upon
it
without
us
in
such
a
process
however
every
observation
will
convince
us
that
we
have
to
do
with
colours
in
a
progressive
and
mutable
but
not
in
a
final
or
complete
state
hence
in
directing
our
attention
to
these
physical
colours
we
find
it
quite
possible
to
place
an
objective
phenomenon
beside
a
subjective
one
and
often
by
means
of
the
union
of
the
two
successfully
to
penetrate
farther
into
the
nature
of
the
appearance
thus
in
the
observations
by
which
we
become
acquainted
with
the
physical
colours
the
eye
is
not
to
be
considered
as
acting
alone
nor
is
the
light
ever
to
be
considered
in
immediate
relation
with
the
eye
but
we
direct
our
attention
especially
to
the
various
effects
produced
by
mediums
those
mediums
being
themselves
colourless
light
under
these
circumstances
may
be
affected
by
three
conditions
first
when
it
flashes
back
from
the
surface
of
a
medium
in
considering
which
experiments
invite
our
attention
secondly
when
it
passes
by
the
edge
of
a
medium
the
phenomena
thus
produced
were
formerly
called
we
prefer
the
term
thirdly
when
it
passes
through
either
a
merely
or
an
actually
transparent
body
thus
constituting
a
class
of
appearances
on
which
experiments
are
founded
we
have
called
a
fourth
class
of
physical
colours
as
the
phenomena
exhibit
themselves
on
the
colourless
surface
of
bodies
under
various
conditions
without
previous
or
actual
dye
βαφή
note
in
examining
these
categories
with
reference
to
our
three
leading
divisions
according
to
which
we
consider
the
phenomena
of
colours
in
a
physiological
physical
or
chemical
view
we
find
that
the
catoptrical
colours
are
closely
connected
with
the
physiological
the
paroptical
are
already
somewhat
more
distinct
and
independent
the
dioptrical
exhibit
themselves
as
entirely
and
strictly
physical
and
as
having
a
decidedly
objective
character
the
epoptical
although
still
only
apparent
may
be
considered
as
the
transition
to
the
chemical
colours
if
we
were
desirous
of
prosecuting
our
investigation
strictly
in
the
order
of
nature
we
ought
to
proceed
according
to
the
classification
which
has
just
been
made
but
in
didactic
treatises
it
is
not
of
so
much
consequence
to
connect
as
to
duly
distinguish
the
various
divisions
of
a
subject
in
order
that
at
last
when
every
single
class
and
case
has
been
presented
to
the
mind
the
whole
may
be
embraced
in
one
comprehensive
view
we
therefore
turn
our
attention
forthwith
to
the
dioptrical
class
in
order
at
once
to
give
the
reader
the
full
impression
of
the
physical
colours
and
to
exhibit
their
characteristics
the
more
strikingly
ix
dioptrical
colours
colours
are
called
dioptrical
when
a
colourless
medium
is
necessary
to
produce
them
the
medium
must
be
such
that
light
and
darkness
can
act
through
it
either
on
the
eye
or
on
opposite
surfaces
it
is
thus
required
that
the
medium
should
be
transparent
or
at
least
capable
to
a
certain
degree
of
transmitting
light
according
to
these
conditions
we
divide
the
dioptrical
phenomena
into
two
classes
placing
in
the
first
those
which
are
produced
by
means
of
imperfectly
transparent
yet
mediums
and
in
the
second
such
as
are
exhibited
when
the
medium
is
in
the
highest
degree
transparent
dioptrical
colours
of
the
first
class
space
if
we
assume
it
to
be
empty
would
have
the
quality
of
absolute
transparency
to
our
vision
if
this
space
is
filled
so
that
the
eye
can
not
perceive
that
it
is
so
there
exists
a
more
or
less
material
transparent
medium
which
may
be
of
the
nature
of
air
and
gas
may
be
fluid
or
even
solid
the
pure
and
medium
is
only
an
accumulated
form
of
the
transparent
medium
it
may
therefore
be
presented
to
us
in
three
modes
the
extreme
degree
of
this
accumulation
is
white
the
simplest
brightest
first
opaque
occupation
of
space
transparency
itself
empirically
considered
is
already
the
first
degree
of
the
opposite
state
the
intermediate
degrees
from
this
point
to
opaque
white
are
infinite
at
whatever
point
short
of
opacity
we
arrest
the
thickening
medium
it
exhibits
simple
and
remarkable
phenomena
when
placed
in
relation
with
light
and
darkness
the
highest
degree
of
light
such
as
that
of
the
sun
of
phosphorus
burning
in
oxygen
is
dazzling
and
colourless
so
the
light
of
the
fixed
stars
is
for
the
most
part
colourless
this
light
however
seen
through
a
medium
but
very
slightly
thickened
appears
to
us
yellow
if
the
density
of
such
a
medium
be
increased
or
if
its
volume
become
greater
we
shall
see
the
light
gradually
assume
a
hue
which
at
last
deepens
to
a
note
if
on
the
other
hand
darkness
is
seen
through
a
medium
which
is
itself
illumined
by
a
light
striking
on
it
a
blue
colour
appears
this
becomes
lighter
and
paler
as
the
density
of
the
medium
is
increased
but
on
the
contrary
appears
darker
and
deeper
the
more
transparent
the
medium
becomes
in
the
least
degree
of
dimness
short
of
absolute
transparence
always
supposing
a
perfectly
colourless
medium
this
deep
blue
approaches
the
most
beautiful
violet
if
this
effect
takes
place
in
the
eye
as
here
described
and
may
thus
be
pronounced
to
be
subjective
it
remains
further
to
convince
ourselves
of
this
by
objective
phenomena
for
a
light
thus
mitigated
and
subdued
illumines
all
objects
in
like
manner
with
a
yellow
or
red
hue
and
although
the
effect
of
darkness
through
the
medium
does
not
exhibit
itself
so
powerfully
yet
the
blue
sky
displays
itself
in
the
camera
obscura
very
distinctly
on
white
paper
as
well
as
every
other
material
colour
in
examining
the
cases
in
which
this
important
leading
phenomenon
appears
we
naturally
mention
the
atmospheric
colours
first
most
of
these
may
be
here
introduced
in
order
the
sun
seen
through
a
certain
degree
of
vapour
appears
with
a
yellow
disk
the
centre
is
often
dazzlingly
yellow
when
the
edges
are
already
red
the
orb
seen
through
a
thick
yellow
mist
appears
as
was
the
case
in
even
in
the
north
the
same
appearance
is
still
more
decided
owing
to
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
when
the
scirocco
prevails
in
southern
climates
the
clouds
generally
surrounding
the
sun
in
the
latter
case
are
of
the
same
colour
which
is
reflected
again
on
all
objects
the
red
hues
of
morning
and
evening
are
owing
to
the
same
cause
the
sun
is
announced
by
a
red
light
in
shining
through
a
greater
mass
of
vapours
the
higher
he
rises
the
yellower
and
brighter
the
light
becomes
if
the
darkness
of
infinite
space
is
seen
through
atmospheric
vapours
illumined
by
the
the
blue
colour
appears
on
high
mountains
the
sky
appears
by
day
intensely
blue
owing
to
the
few
thin
vapours
that
float
before
the
endless
dark
space
as
soon
as
we
descend
in
the
valleys
the
blue
becomes
lighter
till
at
last
in
certain
regions
and
in
consequence
of
increasing
vapours
it
altogether
changes
to
a
very
pale
blue
the
mountains
in
like
manner
appear
to
us
blue
for
as
we
see
them
at
so
great
a
distance
that
we
no
longer
distinguish
the
local
tints
and
as
no
light
reflected
from
their
surface
acts
on
our
vision
they
are
equivalent
to
mere
dark
objects
which
owing
to
the
interposed
vapours
appear
blue
so
we
find
the
shadowed
parts
of
nearer
objects
are
blue
when
the
air
is
charged
with
thin
vapours
the
on
the
other
hand
at
a
great
distance
still
appear
white
or
approaching
to
a
yellowish
hue
because
they
act
on
our
eyes
as
brightness
seen
through
atmospheric
vapour
the
blue
appearance
at
the
lower
part
of
the
flame
of
a
candle
belongs
to
the
same
class
of
phenomena
if
the
flame
be
held
before
a
white
ground
no
blue
will
be
seen
but
this
colour
will
immediately
appear
if
the
flame
is
opposed
to
a
black
ground
this
phenomenon
may
be
exhibited
most
strikingly
with
a
spoonful
of
lighted
spirits
of
wine
we
may
thus
consider
the
lower
part
of
the
flame
as
equivalent
to
the
vapour
which
although
infinitely
thin
is
still
apparent
before
the
dark
surface
it
is
so
thin
that
one
may
easily
see
to
read
through
it
on
the
other
hand
the
point
of
the
flame
which
conceals
objects
from
our
sight
is
to
be
considered
as
a
body
lastly
smoke
is
also
to
be
considered
as
a
medium
which
appears
to
us
yellow
or
reddish
before
a
light
ground
but
blue
before
a
dark
one
if
we
now
turn
our
attention
to
fluid
mediums
we
find
that
water
deprived
in
a
very
slight
degree
of
its
transparency
produces
the
same
effects
the
infusion
of
the
lignum
nephriticum
guilandina
linnæi
which
formerly
excited
so
much
attention
is
only
a
liquor
which
in
dark
wooden
cups
must
appear
blue
but
held
towards
the
sun
in
a
transparent
glass
must
exhibit
a
yellow
appearance
a
drop
of
scented
water
of
spirit
varnish
of
several
metallic
solutions
may
be
employed
to
give
various
degrees
of
opacity
to
water
for
such
experiments
spirit
of
soap
perhaps
answers
best
the
bottom
of
the
sea
appears
to
divers
of
a
red
colour
in
bright
sunshine
in
this
case
the
water
owing
to
its
depth
acts
as
a
medium
under
these
circumstances
they
find
the
shadows
green
which
is
the
complemental
colour
among
solid
mediums
the
opal
attracts
our
attention
first
its
colours
are
at
least
partly
to
be
explained
by
the
circumstance
that
it
is
in
fact
a
medium
through
which
sometimes
light
sometimes
dark
substrata
are
visible
for
these
experiments
however
the
vitrum
astroides
girasole
is
the
most
desirable
material
it
is
prepared
in
various
ways
and
its
is
produced
by
metallic
oxydes
the
same
effect
is
produced
also
by
melting
pulverised
and
calcined
bones
together
with
the
glass
on
which
account
it
is
also
known
by
the
name
of
but
prepared
in
this
mode
it
easily
becomes
too
opaque
this
glass
may
be
adapted
for
experiments
in
various
ways
it
may
either
be
made
in
a
very
slight
degree
in
which
case
the
light
seen
through
various
layers
placed
one
upon
the
other
may
be
deepened
from
the
lightest
yellow
to
the
deepest
red
or
if
made
originally
more
opaque
it
may
be
employed
in
thinner
or
thicker
laminæ
the
experiments
may
be
successfully
made
in
both
ways
in
order
however
to
see
the
bright
blue
colour
the
glass
should
neither
be
too
opaque
nor
too
thick
for
as
it
is
quite
natural
that
darkness
must
act
weakly
through
the
medium
so
this
medium
if
too
thick
soon
approaches
whiteness
panes
of
glass
throw
a
yellow
light
on
objects
through
those
parts
where
they
happen
to
be
and
these
same
parts
appear
blue
if
we
look
at
a
dark
object
through
them
smoked
glass
may
be
also
mentioned
here
and
is
in
like
manner
to
be
considered
as
a
medium
it
exhibits
the
sun
more
or
less
and
although
this
appearance
may
be
attributed
to
the
colour
of
the
soot
we
may
still
convince
ourselves
that
a
medium
here
acts
if
we
hold
such
a
glass
moderately
smoked
and
lit
by
the
sun
on
the
unsmoked
side
before
a
dark
object
for
we
shall
then
perceive
a
bluish
appearance
a
striking
experiment
may
be
made
in
a
dark
room
with
sheets
of
parchment
if
we
fasten
a
piece
of
parchment
before
the
opening
in
the
when
the
sun
shines
it
will
appear
nearly
white
by
adding
a
second
a
yellowish
colour
appears
which
still
increases
as
more
leaves
are
added
till
at
last
it
changes
to
red
a
similar
effect
owing
to
the
state
of
the
crystalline
lens
in
milky
cataract
has
been
already
adverted
to
having
now
in
tracing
these
phenomena
arrived
at
the
effect
of
a
degree
of
opacity
scarcely
capable
of
transmitting
light
we
may
here
mention
a
singular
appearance
which
was
owing
to
a
momentary
state
of
this
kind
a
portrait
of
a
celebrated
theologian
had
been
painted
some
years
before
the
circumstance
to
which
we
allude
by
an
artist
who
was
known
to
have
considerable
skill
in
the
management
of
his
materials
the
very
reverend
individual
was
represented
in
a
rich
velvet
dress
which
was
not
a
little
admired
and
which
attracted
the
eye
of
the
spectator
almost
more
than
the
face
the
picture
however
from
the
effect
of
the
smoke
of
lamps
and
dust
had
lost
much
of
its
original
vivacity
it
was
therefore
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
painter
who
was
to
clean
it
and
give
it
a
fresh
coat
of
varnish
this
person
began
his
operations
by
carefully
washing
the
picture
with
a
sponge
no
sooner
however
had
he
gone
over
the
surface
once
or
twice
and
wiped
away
the
first
dirt
than
to
his
amazement
the
black
velvet
dress
changed
suddenly
to
a
light
blue
plush
which
gave
the
ecclesiastic
a
very
secular
though
somewhat
appearance
the
painter
did
not
venture
to
go
on
with
his
washing
he
could
not
comprehend
how
a
light
blue
should
be
the
ground
of
the
deepest
black
still
less
how
he
could
so
suddenly
have
removed
a
glazing
colour
capable
of
converting
the
one
tint
to
the
other
at
all
events
he
was
not
a
little
disconcerted
at
having
spoilt
the
picture
to
such
an
extent
nothing
to
characterize
the
ecclesiastic
remained
but
the
round
wig
which
made
the
exchange
of
a
faded
plush
for
a
handsome
new
velvet
dress
far
from
desirable
meanwhile
the
mischief
appeared
irreparable
and
the
good
artist
having
turned
the
picture
to
the
wall
retired
to
rest
with
a
mind
ill
at
ease
but
what
was
his
joy
the
next
morning
when
on
examining
the
picture
he
beheld
the
black
velvet
dress
again
in
its
full
splendour
he
could
not
refrain
from
again
wetting
a
corner
upon
which
the
blue
colour
again
appeared
and
after
a
time
vanished
on
hearing
of
this
phenomenon
i
went
at
once
to
see
the
miraculous
picture
a
wet
sponge
was
passed
over
it
in
my
presence
and
the
change
quickly
took
place
i
saw
a
somewhat
faded
but
decidedly
light
blue
plush
dress
the
folds
under
the
arm
being
indicated
by
some
brown
strokes
i
explained
this
appearance
to
myself
by
the
doctrine
of
the
medium
the
painter
in
order
to
give
additional
depth
to
his
black
may
have
passed
some
particular
varnish
over
it
on
being
washed
this
varnish
imbibed
some
moisture
and
hence
became
in
consequence
of
which
the
black
underneath
immediately
appeared
blue
perhaps
those
who
are
practically
acquainted
with
the
effect
of
varnishes
may
through
accident
or
contrivance
arrive
at
some
means
of
exhibiting
this
singular
appearance
as
an
experiment
to
those
who
are
fond
of
investigating
natural
phenomena
notwithstanding
many
attempts
i
could
not
myself
succeed
in
it
having
now
traced
the
most
splendid
instances
of
atmospheric
appearances
as
well
as
other
less
striking
yet
sufficiently
remarkable
cases
to
the
leading
examples
of
mediums
we
have
no
doubt
that
attentive
observers
of
nature
will
carry
such
researches
further
and
accustom
themselves
to
trace
and
explain
the
various
appearances
which
present
themselves
in
experience
on
the
same
principle
we
may
also
hope
that
such
investigators
will
provide
themselves
with
an
adequate
apparatus
in
order
to
place
remarkable
facts
before
the
eyes
of
others
who
may
be
desirous
of
information
we
venture
once
for
all
to
call
the
leading
appearance
in
question
as
generally
described
in
the
foregoing
pages
a
primordial
and
elementary
phenomenon
and
we
may
here
be
permitted
at
once
to
state
what
we
understand
by
the
term
the
circumstances
which
come
under
our
notice
in
ordinary
observation
are
for
the
most
part
insulated
cases
which
with
some
attention
admit
of
being
classed
under
general
leading
facts
these
again
range
themselves
under
theoretical
rubrics
which
are
more
comprehensive
and
through
which
we
become
better
acquainted
with
certain
indispensable
conditions
of
appearances
in
detail
from
henceforth
everything
is
gradually
arranged
under
higher
rules
and
laws
which
however
are
not
to
be
made
intelligible
by
words
and
hypotheses
to
the
understanding
merely
but
at
the
same
time
by
real
phenomena
to
the
senses
we
call
these
primordial
phenomena
because
nothing
appreciable
by
the
senses
lies
beyond
them
on
the
contrary
they
are
perfectly
fit
to
be
considered
as
a
fixed
point
to
which
we
first
ascended
step
by
step
and
from
which
we
may
in
like
manner
descend
to
the
commonest
case
of
experience
such
an
original
phenomenon
is
that
which
has
lately
engaged
our
attention
we
see
on
the
one
side
light
brightness
on
the
other
darkness
obscurity
we
bring
the
medium
between
the
two
and
from
these
contrasts
and
this
medium
the
colours
develop
themselves
contrasted
in
like
manner
but
soon
through
a
reciprocal
relation
directly
tending
again
to
a
point
of
union
with
this
conviction
we
look
upon
the
mistake
that
has
been
committed
in
the
investigation
of
this
subject
to
be
a
very
serious
one
inasmuch
as
a
secondary
phenomenon
has
been
thus
placed
higher
in
order
the
primordial
phenomenon
has
been
degraded
to
an
inferior
place
nay
the
secondary
phenomenon
has
been
placed
at
the
head
a
compound
effect
has
been
treated
as
simple
a
simple
appearance
as
compound
owing
to
this
contradiction
the
most
capricious
complication
and
perplexity
have
been
introduced
into
physical
inquiries
the
effects
of
which
are
still
apparent
but
when
even
such
a
primordial
phenomenon
is
arrived
at
the
evil
still
is
that
we
refuse
to
recognise
it
as
such
that
we
still
aim
at
something
beyond
although
it
would
become
us
to
confess
that
we
are
arrived
at
the
limits
of
experimental
knowledge
let
the
observer
of
nature
suffer
the
primordial
phenomenon
to
remain
undisturbed
in
its
beauty
let
the
philosopher
admit
it
into
his
department
and
he
will
find
that
important
elementary
facts
are
a
worthier
basis
for
further
operations
than
insulated
cases
opinions
and
note
that
is
according
to
the
author
statement
both
tend
to
red
the
yellow
deepening
to
orange
as
the
comparatively
dark
medium
is
thickened
before
brightness
the
blue
deepening
to
violet
as
the
light
medium
is
thinned
before
t
pg
xi
dioptrical
colours
of
the
second
refraction
dioptrical
colours
of
both
classes
are
closely
connected
as
will
presently
appear
on
a
little
examination
those
of
the
first
class
appeared
through
mediums
those
of
the
second
class
will
now
appear
through
transparent
mediums
but
since
every
substance
however
transparent
may
be
already
considered
to
partake
of
the
opposite
quality
as
every
accumulation
of
a
medium
called
transparent
proves
so
the
near
affinity
of
the
two
classes
is
sufficiently
manifest
we
will
however
first
consider
transparent
mediums
abstractedly
as
such
as
entirely
free
from
any
degree
of
opacity
and
direct
our
whole
attention
to
a
phenomenon
which
here
presents
itself
and
which
is
known
by
the
name
of
refraction
in
treating
of
the
physiological
colours
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
vindicate
what
pg
were
formerly
called
illusions
of
sight
as
the
active
energies
of
the
healthy
and
duly
efficient
eye
and
we
are
now
again
invited
to
consider
similar
instances
confirming
the
constancy
of
the
laws
of
vision
throughout
nature
as
presented
to
the
senses
everything
depends
on
the
relation
which
things
bear
to
each
other
but
especially
on
the
relation
which
man
the
most
important
of
these
bears
to
the
rest
hence
the
world
divides
itself
into
two
parts
and
the
human
being
as
stands
opposed
to
the
thus
the
practical
man
exhausts
himself
in
the
accumulation
of
facts
the
thinker
in
speculation
each
being
called
upon
to
sustain
a
conflict
which
admits
of
no
peace
and
no
decision
but
still
the
main
point
always
is
whether
the
relations
are
truly
seen
as
our
senses
if
healthy
are
the
surest
witnesses
of
external
relations
so
we
may
be
convinced
that
in
all
instances
where
they
appear
to
contradict
reality
they
lay
the
greater
and
surer
stress
on
true
relations
thus
a
distant
object
appears
to
us
smaller
and
precisely
by
this
means
we
are
aware
of
distance
we
produced
coloured
appearances
on
colourless
objects
through
colourless
mediums
and
at
the
same
moment
our
attention
was
called
to
the
degree
of
opacity
in
the
medium
thus
the
different
degrees
of
opacity
in
transparent
mediums
nay
even
other
physical
and
chemical
properties
belonging
to
them
are
known
to
our
vision
by
means
of
refraction
and
invite
us
to
make
further
trials
in
order
to
penetrate
more
completely
by
physical
and
chemical
means
into
those
secrets
which
are
already
opened
to
our
view
on
one
side
objects
seen
through
mediums
more
or
less
transparent
do
not
appear
to
us
in
the
place
which
they
should
occupy
according
to
the
laws
of
perspective
on
this
fact
the
dioptrical
colours
of
the
second
class
depend
those
laws
of
vision
which
admit
of
being
expressed
in
mathematical
formulæ
are
based
on
the
principle
that
as
light
proceeds
in
straight
lines
it
must
be
possible
to
draw
a
straight
line
from
the
eye
to
any
given
object
in
order
that
it
be
seen
if
therefore
a
case
arises
in
which
the
light
arrives
to
us
in
a
bent
or
broken
line
that
we
see
the
object
by
means
of
a
bent
or
broken
line
we
are
at
once
informed
that
the
medium
between
the
eye
and
the
object
is
denser
or
that
it
has
assumed
this
or
that
foreign
nature
this
deviation
from
the
law
of
vision
is
known
by
the
general
term
of
refraction
and
although
we
may
take
it
for
granted
that
our
readers
are
sufficiently
acquainted
with
its
effects
yet
we
will
here
once
more
briefly
exhibit
it
in
its
objective
and
subjective
point
of
view
let
the
sun
shine
diagonally
into
an
empty
cubical
vessel
so
that
the
opposite
side
be
illumined
but
not
the
bottom
let
water
be
then
poured
into
this
vessel
and
the
direction
of
the
light
will
be
immediately
altered
for
a
part
of
the
bottom
is
shone
upon
at
the
point
where
the
light
enters
the
thicker
medium
it
deviates
from
its
rectilinear
direction
and
appears
broken
hence
the
phenomenon
is
called
the
breaking
or
refraction
thus
much
of
the
objective
experiment
we
arrive
at
the
subjective
fact
in
the
following
mode
let
the
eye
be
substituted
for
the
sun
let
the
sight
be
directed
in
like
manner
pg
diagonally
over
one
side
so
that
the
opposite
inner
side
be
entirely
seen
while
no
part
of
the
bottom
is
visible
on
pouring
in
water
the
eye
will
perceive
a
part
of
the
bottom
and
this
takes
place
without
our
being
aware
that
we
do
not
see
in
a
straight
line
for
the
bottom
appears
to
us
raised
and
hence
we
give
the
term
elevation
to
the
subjective
phenomenon
some
points
which
are
particularly
remarkable
with
reference
to
this
will
be
adverted
to
hereafter
were
we
now
to
express
this
phenomenon
generally
we
might
here
repeat
in
conformity
with
the
view
lately
taken
that
the
relation
of
the
objects
is
changed
or
deranged
but
as
it
is
our
intention
at
present
to
separate
the
objective
from
the
subjective
appearances
we
first
express
the
phenomenon
in
a
subjective
form
and
say
a
derangement
or
displacement
of
the
object
seen
or
to
be
seen
takes
place
but
that
which
is
seen
without
a
limiting
outline
may
be
thus
affected
without
our
perceiving
the
change
on
the
other
hand
if
what
we
look
at
has
a
visible
termination
we
have
an
evident
indication
that
a
displacement
occurs
if
therefore
pg
we
wish
to
ascertain
the
relation
or
degree
of
such
a
displacement
we
must
chiefly
confine
ourselves
to
the
alteration
of
surfaces
with
visible
boundaries
in
other
words
to
the
displacement
of
circumscribed
objects
the
general
effect
may
take
place
through
parallel
mediums
for
every
parallel
medium
displaces
the
object
by
bringing
it
perpendicularly
towards
the
eye
the
apparent
change
of
position
is
however
more
observable
through
mediums
that
are
not
parallel
these
latter
may
be
perfectly
spherical
or
may
be
employed
in
the
form
of
convex
or
concave
lenses
we
shall
make
use
of
all
these
as
occasion
may
require
in
our
experiments
but
as
they
not
only
displace
the
object
from
its
position
but
alter
it
in
various
ways
we
shall
in
most
cases
prefer
employing
mediums
with
surfaces
not
indeed
parallel
with
reference
to
each
other
but
still
altogether
plane
namely
prisms
these
have
a
triangle
for
their
base
and
may
it
is
true
be
considered
as
portions
of
a
lens
but
they
are
particularly
available
for
our
experiments
inasmuch
as
they
very
perceptibly
displace
the
object
from
its
position
without
producing
a
remarkable
distortion
and
now
in
order
to
conduct
our
observations
with
as
much
exactness
as
possible
and
to
avoid
all
confusion
and
ambiguity
we
confine
ourselves
at
first
to
subjective
experiments
in
which
namely
the
object
is
seen
by
the
observer
through
a
refracting
medium
as
soon
as
we
have
treated
these
in
due
series
the
objective
experiments
will
follow
in
similar
order
xii
refraction
without
the
appearance
of
colour
refraction
can
visibly
take
place
without
our
perceiving
an
appearance
of
colour
to
whatever
extent
a
colourless
or
uniformly
coloured
surface
may
be
altered
as
to
its
position
by
refraction
no
colour
consequent
upon
refraction
appears
within
it
provided
it
has
no
outline
or
boundary
we
may
convince
ourselves
of
this
in
various
ways
place
a
glass
cube
on
any
larger
surface
and
look
through
the
glass
perpendicularly
or
obliquely
the
unbroken
surface
opposite
the
eye
appears
altogether
raised
but
no
colour
exhibits
itself
if
we
look
at
a
pure
grey
or
blue
sky
or
a
uniformly
white
or
coloured
wall
through
a
prism
the
portion
of
the
surface
which
the
eye
thus
embraces
will
be
altogether
changed
as
to
its
position
without
our
therefore
observing
the
smallest
appearance
of
colour
xiii
conditions
of
the
appearance
of
colour
although
in
the
foregoing
experiments
we
have
found
all
unbroken
surfaces
large
or
small
colourless
yet
at
the
outlines
or
boundaries
where
the
surface
is
relieved
upon
a
darker
or
lighter
object
we
observe
a
coloured
appearance
outline
as
well
as
surface
is
necessary
to
constitute
a
figure
or
circumscribed
object
we
therefore
express
the
leading
fact
thus
circumscribed
objects
must
be
displaced
by
refraction
in
order
to
the
exhibition
of
an
appearance
of
colour
we
place
before
us
the
simplest
object
a
light
disk
on
a
dark
ground
a
a
displacement
occurs
with
regard
to
this
object
if
we
apparently
extend
its
outline
from
the
centre
by
magnifying
it
this
may
be
done
with
any
convex
glass
and
in
this
case
we
see
a
blue
edge
b
we
can
to
appearance
contract
the
circumference
of
the
same
light
disk
towards
the
centre
by
diminishing
the
object
the
edge
will
then
appear
yellow
c
this
may
be
done
with
a
concave
glass
which
however
should
not
be
ground
thin
like
common
but
must
have
some
substance
in
order
however
to
make
this
experiment
at
once
with
the
convex
glass
let
a
smaller
black
disk
be
inserted
within
the
light
disk
on
a
black
ground
if
we
magnify
the
black
disk
on
a
white
ground
with
a
convex
glass
the
same
result
takes
place
as
if
we
diminished
the
white
disk
for
we
extend
the
black
outline
upon
the
white
and
we
thus
perceive
the
yellow
edge
together
with
the
blue
edge
d
these
two
appearances
the
blue
and
yellow
exhibit
themselves
in
and
upon
the
white
they
both
assume
a
reddish
hue
in
proportion
as
they
mingle
with
the
black
illustration
in
this
short
statement
we
have
described
the
primordial
phenomena
of
all
appearance
of
colour
occasioned
by
refraction
these
undoubtedly
may
be
repeated
varied
and
rendered
more
striking
may
be
combined
complicated
confused
but
after
all
may
be
still
restored
to
their
original
simplicity
in
examining
the
process
of
the
experiment
just
given
we
find
that
in
the
one
case
we
have
to
appearance
extended
the
white
edge
upon
the
dark
surface
in
the
other
we
have
extended
the
dark
edge
upon
the
white
surface
supplanting
one
by
the
other
pushing
one
over
the
other
we
will
now
endeavour
step
by
step
to
analyse
these
and
similar
cases
if
we
cause
the
white
disk
to
move
in
appearance
entirely
from
its
place
which
can
be
done
effectually
by
prisms
it
will
be
coloured
according
to
the
direction
in
which
it
apparently
moves
in
conformity
with
the
above
laws
if
we
look
at
the
disk
through
a
prism
so
that
it
appear
moved
to
the
outer
edge
will
appear
blue
and
according
to
the
law
of
the
figure
b
fig
the
other
edge
being
yellow
and
according
to
the
law
of
the
figure
c
fig
for
in
the
first
case
the
white
figure
is
as
it
were
extended
over
the
dark
boundary
and
in
the
other
case
the
dark
boundary
is
passed
over
the
white
figure
the
same
happens
if
the
disk
is
to
appearance
moved
from
to
from
to
and
so
throughout
the
circle
as
it
is
with
the
simple
effect
so
it
is
with
more
complicated
appearances
if
we
look
through
a
horizontal
prism
at
a
white
disk
placed
at
some
distance
behind
it
at
the
disk
will
be
raised
to
and
coloured
according
to
the
above
law
if
we
remove
this
prism
and
look
through
a
vertical
one
at
the
same
disk
it
will
appear
at
and
coloured
according
to
the
same
law
if
we
place
the
two
prisms
one
upon
the
other
the
disk
will
appear
displaced
diagonally
in
conformity
with
a
general
law
of
nature
and
will
be
coloured
as
before
that
is
according
to
its
movement
in
the
direction
if
we
attentively
examine
these
opposite
coloured
edges
we
find
that
they
only
appear
in
the
direction
of
the
apparent
change
of
place
a
round
figure
leaves
us
in
some
degree
uncertain
as
to
this
a
quadrangular
figure
removes
all
doubt
the
quadrangular
figure
moved
in
the
direction
or
exhibits
no
colour
on
the
sides
which
are
parallel
with
the
direction
in
which
it
moves
on
the
other
hand
if
moved
in
the
direction
parallel
with
its
diagonal
all
the
edges
of
the
figure
appear
coloured
thus
a
former
position
is
here
confirmed
viz
to
produce
colour
an
object
must
be
so
displaced
that
the
light
edges
be
apparently
carried
over
a
dark
surface
the
dark
edges
over
a
light
surface

figure

its
boundary

boundary

the
figure

the
rectilinear
boundaries
of
a
figure
could
be
indefinitely
extended
by
refraction

figure
and
background
might
only
pursue
their
course
next
but
not
over
each
other
no
colour
would
appear

paragraph
xiv
conditions
under
which
the
appearance
of
colour
increases
we
have
seen
in
the
foregoing
experiments
that
all
appearance
of
colour
occasioned
by
refraction
depends
on
the
condition
that
the
boundary
or
edge
be
moved
in
upon
the
object
itself
or
the
object
itself
over
the
ground
that
the
figure
should
be
as
it
were
carried
over
itself
or
over
the
ground
and
we
shall
now
find
that
by
increased
displacement
of
the
object
the
appearance
of
colour
exhibits
itself
in
a
greater
degree
this
takes
place
in
subjective
experiments
to
which
for
the
present
we
confine
ourselves
under
the
following
conditions
first
if
in
looking
through
parallel
mediums
the
eye
is
directed
more
obliquely
secondly
if
the
surfaces
of
the
medium
are
no
longer
parallel
but
form
a
more
or
less
acute
angle
thirdly
owing
to
the
increased
proportion
of
the
medium
whether
parallel
mediums
be
increased
in
size
or
whether
the
angle
be
increased
provided
it
does
not
attain
a
right
angle
fourthly
owing
to
the
distance
of
the
eye
armed
with
a
refracting
medium
from
the
object
to
be
displaced
fifthly
owing
to
a
chemical
property
that
may
be
communicated
to
the
glass
and
which
may
be
afterwards
increased
in
effect
the
greatest
change
of
place
short
of
considerable
distortion
of
the
object
is
produced
by
means
of
prisms
and
this
is
the
reason
why
the
appearance
of
colour
can
be
exhibited
most
powerfully
through
glasses
of
this
form
yet
we
will
not
in
employing
them
suffer
ourselves
to
be
dazzled
by
the
splendid
appearances
they
exhibit
but
keep
the
above
simple
principles
calmly
in
view
the
colour
which
is
outside
or
foremost
in
the
apparent
change
of
an
object
by
refraction
is
always
the
broader
and
we
will
henceforth
call
this
a
the
colour
that
remains
next
the
outline
is
the
narrower
and
this
we
will
call
an
if
we
move
a
dark
boundary
towards
a
light
surface
the
yellow
broader
border
is
foremost
and
the
narrower
edge
follows
close
to
the
outline
if
we
move
a
light
boundary
towards
a
dark
surface
the
broader
violet
border
is
foremost
and
the
narrower
blue
edge
follows
if
the
object
is
large
its
centre
remains
uncoloured
its
inner
surface
is
then
to
be
considered
as
unlimited
it
is
displaced
but
not
otherwise
altered
but
if
the
object
is
so
narrow
that
under
the
above
conditions
the
yellow
border
can
reach
the
blue
edge
the
space
between
the
outlines
will
be
entirely
covered
with
colour
if
we
make
this
experiment
with
a
white
stripe
on
a
black
ground
the
two
extremes
will
presently
meet
and
thus
produce
green
we
shall
then
see
the
following
series
of
colours
yellow
green
blue
if
we
place
a
black
band
or
stripe
on
white
paper
the
violet
border
will
spread
till
it
meets
the
edge
in
this
case
the
intermediate
black
is
effaced
as
the
intermediate
white
was
in
the
last
experiment
and
in
its
stead
a
splendid
pure
red
will
appear
the
series
of
colours
will
now
be
as
follows
blue
red
yellow
the
yellow
and
blue
in
the
first
case
can
by
degrees
meet
so
fully
that
the
two
colours
blend
entirely
in
green
and
the
order
will
then
be
green
in
the
second
case
under
similar
circumstances
we
see
only
blue

yellow
this
appearance
is
best
exhibited
by
refracting
the
bars
of
a
window
when
they
are
relieved
on
a
grey
sky
in
all
this
we
are
never
to
forget
that
this
appearance
is
not
to
be
considered
as
a
complete
or
final
state
but
always
as
a
progressive
increasing
and
in
many
senses
controllable
appearance
thus
we
find
that
by
the
negation
of
the
above
five
conditions

gradually
decreases
and

last
disappears

explanation
of
the
foregoing
phenomena
before
we
proceed
further
it
is
incumbent
on
us
to
explain
the
first
tolerably
simple
phenomenon
and
to
show
its
connexion
with
the
principles
first
laid
down
in
order
that
the
observer
of
nature
may
be
enabled
clearly
to
comprehend
the
more
complicated
appearances
that
follow
in
the
first
place
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
we
have
to
do
with
circumscribed
objects
in
the
act
of
seeing
generally
it
is
the
circumscribed
visible
which
chiefly
invites
our
observation
and
in
the
present
instance
in
speaking
of
the
appearance
of
colour
as
occasioned
by
refraction
the
circumscribed
visible
the
detached
object
solely
occupies
our
attention
for
our
chromatic
exhibitions
we
can
however
divide
objects
generally
into
and
the
expressions
of
themselves
denote
what
we
understand
by
them
but
our
meaning
will
be
rendered
still
more
plain
by
what
follows
primary
objects
may
be
considered
firstly
as
as
images
which
are
impressed
on
the
eye
by
things
before
it
and
which
assure
us
of
their
reality
to
these
the
secondary
images
may
be
opposed
as
images
which
remain
in
the
organ
when
the
object
itself
is
taken
away
those
apparent
which
have
been
circumstantially
treated
of
in
the
doctrine
of
physiological
colours
the
primary
images
again
may
be
considered
as
images
which
like
the
original
impressions
are
conveyed
immediately
from
the
object
to
the
eye
in
contradistinction
to
these
the
secondary
images
may
be
considered
as
being
only
conveyed
to
us
as
it
were
at
from
a
reflecting
surface
these
are
the
mirrored
or
catoptrical
images
which
in
certain
cases
can
also
become
double
images
when
namely
the
reflecting
body
is
transparent
and
has
two
parallel
surfaces
one
behind
the
other
in
such
a
case
an
image
may
be
reflected
to
the
eye
from
both
surfaces
and
thus
arise
double
images
inasmuch
as
the
upper
image
does
not
quite
cover
the
under
one
this
may
take
place
in
various
ways
let
a
be
held
before
a
mirror
we
shall
at
first
see
the
distinct
image
of
the
card
but
the
edge
of
the
whole
card
as
well
as
that
of
every
spot
upon
it
will
be
bounded
on
one
side
with
a
border
which
is
the
beginning
of
the
second
reflection
this
effect
varies
in
different
mirrors
according
to
the
different
thickness
of
the
glass
and
the
accidents
of
polishing
if
a
person
wearing
a
white
waistcoat
with
the
remaining
part
of
his
dress
dark
stands
before
certain
mirrors
the
border
appears
very
distinctly
and
in
like
manner
the
metal
buttons
on
dark
cloth
exhibit
the
double
reflection
very
evidently
the
reader
who
has
made
himself
acquainted
with
our
former
descriptions
of
experiments
will
the
more
readily
follow
the
present
statement
the
reflected
by
plates
of
glass
appear
double
and
by
increased
thickness
of
the
glass
and
a
due
adaptation
of
the
angle
of
reflection
the
two
reflections
may
be
entirely
separated
from
each
other
so
a
vase
full
of
water
with
a
plane
bottom
reflects
any
object
twice
the
two
reflections
being
more
or
less
separated
under
the
same
conditions
in
these
cases
it
is
to
be
observed
that
where
the
two
reflections
cover
each
other
the
perfect
vivid
image
is
reflected
but
where
they
are
separated
they
exhibit
only
weak
transparent
and
shadowy
images
if
we
wish
to
know
which
is
the
under
and
which
the
upper
image
we
have
only
to
take
a
coloured
medium
for
then
a
light
object
reflected
from
the
under
surface
is
of
the
colour
of
the
medium
while
that
reflected
from
the
upper
surface
presents
the
complemental
colour
with
dark
objects
it
is
the
reverse
hence
black
and
white
surfaces
may
be
here
also
conveniently
employed
how
easily
the
double
images
assume
and
evoke
colours
will
here
again
be
striking
thirdly
the
primary
images
may
be
considered
as
images
while
the
secondary
can
be
as
it
were
annexed
to
these
as
images
such
an
accessory
image
produces
a
sort
of
double
form
except
that
it
does
not
separate
itself
from
the
principal
object
although
it
may
be
said
to
be
always
endeavouring
to
do
so
it
is
with
secondary
images
of
this
last
description
that
we
have
to
do
in
prismatic
appearances
a
surface
without
a
boundary
exhibits
no
appearance
of
colour
when
refracted
whatever
is
seen
must
be
circumscribed
by
an
outline
to
produce
this
effect
in
other
words
a
figure
an
object
is
required
this
object
undergoes
an
apparent
change
of
place
by
refraction
the
change
is
however
not
complete
not
clean
not
sharp
but
incomplete
inasmuch
as
an
accessory
image
only
is
produced
in
examining
every
appearance
of
nature
but
especially
in
examining
an
important
and
striking
one
we
should
not
remain
in
one
spot
we
should
not
confine
ourselves
to
the
insulated
fact
nor
dwell
on
it
exclusively
but
look
round
through
all
nature
to
see
where
something
similar
something
that
has
affinity
to
it
appears
for
it
is
only
by
combining
analogies
that
we
gradually
arrive
at
a
whole
which
speaks
for
itself
and
requires
no
further
explanation
thus
we
here
call
to
mind
that
in
certain
cases
refraction
unquestionably
produces
double
images
as
is
the
case
in
iceland
spar
similar
double
images
are
also
apparent
in
cases
of
refraction
through
large
rock
crystals
and
in
other
instances
phenomena
which
have
not
hitherto
been
sufficiently
observed
but
since
in
the
case
under
consideration
the
question
relates
not
to
double
but
to
accessory
images
we
refer
to
a
phenomenon
already
adverted
to
but
not
yet
thoroughly
investigated
we
allude
to
an
earlier
experiment
in
which
it
appeared
that
a
sort
of
conflict
took
place
in
regard
to
the
retina
between
a
light
object
and
its
dark
ground
and
between
a
dark
object
and
its
light
ground
the
light
object
in
this
case
appeared
larger
the
dark
one
smaller
by
a
more
exact
observation
of
this
phenomenon
we
may
remark
that
the
forms
are
not
sharply
distinguished
from
the
ground
but
that
they
appear
with
a
kind
of
grey
in
some
degree
coloured
edge
in
short
with
an
accessory
image
if
then
objects
seen
only
with
the
naked
eye
produce
such
effects
what
may
not
take
place
when
a
dense
medium
is
interposed
it
is
not
that
alone
which
presents
itself
to
us
in
obvious
operation
which
produces
and
suffers
effects
but
likewise
all
principles
that
have
a
mutual
relation
only
of
some
sort
are
efficient
accordingly
and
indeed
often
in
a
very
high
degree
thus
when
refraction
produces
its
effect
on
an
object
there
appears
an
accessory
image
next
the
object
itself
the
real
form
thus
refracted
seems
even
to
linger
behind
as
if
resisting
the
change
of
place
but
the
accessory
image
seems
to
advance
and
extends
itself
more
or
less
in
the
mode
already
shown
we
also
remarked
that
in
double
images
the
fainter
appear
only
half
substantial
having
a
kind
of
transparent
evanescent
character
just
as
the
fainter
shades
of
double
shadows
must
always
appear
as
these
latter
assume
colours
easily
and
produce
them
readily
the
former
also
and
the
same
takes
place
in
the
instance
of
accessory
images
which
it
is
true
do
not
altogether
quit
the
real
object
but
still
advance
or
extend
from
it
as
images
and
hence
can
appear
coloured
so
quickly
and
so
powerfully
that
the
prismatic
appearance
is
in
fact
an
accessory
image
we
may
convince
ourselves
in
more
than
one
mode
it
corresponds
exactly
with
the
form
of
the
object
itself
whether
the
object
be
bounded
by
a
straight
line
or
a
curve
indented
or
waving
the
form
of
the
accessory
image
corresponds
throughout
exactly
with
the
form
of
the
object
again
not
only
the
form
but
other
qualities
of
the
object
are
communicated
to
the
accessory
image
if
the
object
is
sharply
relieved
from
its
ground
like
white
on
black
the
coloured
accessory
image
in
like
manner
appears
in
its
greatest
force
it
is
vivid
distinct
and
powerful
but
it
is
most
especially
powerful
when
a
luminous
object
is
shown
on
a
dark
ground
which
may
be
contrived
in
various
ways
but
if
the
object
is
but
faintly
distinguished
from
the
ground
like
grey
objects
on
black
or
white
or
even
on
each
other
the
accessory
image
is
also
faint
and
when
the
original
difference
of
tint
or
force
is
slight
becomes
hardly
discernible
the
appearances
which
are
observable
when
coloured
objects
are
relieved
on
light
dark
or
coloured
grounds
are
moreover
well
worthy
of
attention
in
this
case
a
union
takes
place
between
the
apparent
colour
of
the
accessory
image
and
the
real
colour
of
the
object
a
compound
colour
is
the
result
which
is
either
assisted
and
enhanced
by
the
accordance
or
neutralised
by
the
opposition
of
its
ingredients
but
the
common
and
general
characteristic
both
of
the
double
and
accessory
image
is
the
tendency
of
a
transparent
medium
to
become
only
half
transparent
or
merely
has
been
before
adverted
to
let
the
reader
assume
that
he
sees
within
or
through
such
a
medium
a
visionary
image
and
he
will
at
once
pronounce
this
latter
to
be
a
image
thus
the
colours
produced
by
refraction
may
be
fitly
explained
by
the
doctrine
of
the
mediums
for
where
dark
passes
over
light
as
the
border
of
the
accessory
image
advances
yellow
appears
and
on
the
other
hand
where
a
light
outline
passes
over
the
dark
background
blue
appears
the
advancing
foremost
colour
is
always
the
broader
thus
the
yellow
spreads
over
the
light
with
a
broad
border
but
the
appears
as
a
narrower
stripe
and
is
next
the
dark
according
to
the
doctrine
of
augmentation
as
an
effect
of
shade
on
the
opposite
side
the
condensed
blue
is
next
the
edge
while
the
advancing
border
spreading
as
a
thinner
veil
over
the
black
produces
the
violet
colour
precisely
on
the
principles
before
explained
in
treating
of
mediums
principles
which
will
hereafter
be
found
equally
efficient
in
many
other
cases
since
an
analysis
like
the
present
requires
to
be
confirmed
by
ocular
demonstration
we
beg
every
reader
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
experiments
hitherto
adduced
not
in
a
superficial
manner
but
fairly
and
thoroughly
we
have
not
placed
arbitrary
signs
before
him
instead
of
the
appearances
themselves
no
modes
of
expression
are
here
proposed
for
his
adoption
which
may
be
repeated
for
ever
without
the
exercise
of
thought
and
without
leading
any
one
to
think
but
we
invite
him
to
examine
intelligible
appearances
which
must
be
present
to
the
eye
and
mind
in
order
to
enable
him
clearly
to
trace
these
appearances
to
their
origin
and
to
explain
them
to
himself
and
to
others
the
date
of
the
publication
is
sometimes
to
be
t
the
forms
in
fig

when
seen
through
a
prism
are
again
intended
to
exemplify
this
in
the
plates
to
the
original
work
curvilinear
figures
are
added
but
the
circles
fig
in
the
same
plate
may
answer
the
same
t
the
author
has
before
observed
that
colour
is
a
degree
of
darkness
and
he
here
means
that
increase
of
darkness
produced
by
transparent
mediums
is
to
a
certain
extent
increase
of
t
xvi
decrease
of
the
appearance
of
colour
we
need
only
take
the
five
conditions
under
which
the
appearance
of
colour
increases
in
the
contrary
order
to
produce
the
contrary
or
decreasing
state
it
may
be
as
well
however
briefly
to
describe
and
review
the
corresponding
modifications
which
are
presented
to
the
eye
at
the
highest
point
of
complete
junction
of
the
opposite
edges
the
colours
appear
as
follows
blue
green
red
yellow
where
the
junction
is
less
complete
the
appearance
is
as
follows
blue
yellow
green
red
blue
yellow
here
therefore
the
surface
still
appears
completely
coloured
but
neither
series
is
to
be
considered
as
an
elementary
series
always
developing
itself
in
the
same
manner
and
in
the
same
degrees
on
the
contrary
they
can
and
should
be
resolved
into
their
elements
and
in
doing
this
we
become
better
acquainted
with
their
nature
and
character
these
elements
then
are

yellow

black
blue
yellow
here
the
surface
itself
the
original
object
which
has
been
hitherto
completely
covered
and
as
it
were
lost
again
appears
in
the
centre
of
the
colours
asserts
its
right
and
enables
us
fully
to
recognise
the
secondary
nature
of
the
accessory
images
which
exhibit
themselves
as
edges
and
borders
note
we
can
make
these
edges
and
borders
as
narrow
as
we
please
nay
we
can
still
have
refraction
in
reserve
after
having
done
away
with
all
appearance
of
colour
at
the
boundary
of
the
object
having
now
sufficiently
investigated
the
exhibition
of
colour
in
this
phenomenon
we
repeat
that
we
can
not
admit
it
to
be
an
elementary
phenomenon
on
the
contrary
we
have
traced
it
to
an
antecedent
and
a
simpler
one
we
have
derived
it
in
connexion
with
the
theory
of
secondary
images
from
the
primordial
phenomenon
of
light
and
darkness
as
affected
or
acted
upon
by
mediums
thus
prepared
we
proceed
to
describe
the
appearances
which
refraction
produces
on
grey
and
coloured
objects
and
this
will
complete
the
section
of
subjective
phenomena
xvii
grey
objects
displaced
by
refraction
hitherto
we
have
confined
our
attention
to
black
and
white
objects
relieved
on
respectively
opposite
grounds
as
seen
through
the
prism
because
the
coloured
edges
and
borders
are
most
clearly
displayed
in
such
cases
we
now
repeat
these
experiments
with
grey
objects
and
again
find
similar
results
as
we
called
black
the
equivalent
of
darkness
and
white
the
representative
of
light
so
we
now
venture
to
say
that
grey
represents
which
partakes
more
or
less
of
light
and
darkness
and
thus
stands
between
the
two
we
invite
the
reader
to
call
to
mind
the
following
facts
as
bearing
on
our
present
view
grey
objects
appear
lighter
on
a
black
than
on
a
white
ground
they
appear
as
a
light
on
a
black
ground
and
larger
as
a
dark
on
the
white
ground
and
smaller
the
darker
the
grey
the
more
it
appears
as
a
faint
light
on
black
as
a
strong
dark
on
white
and
hence
the
accessory
images
of
on
black
are
faint
on
white
strong
so
the
accessory
images
of
on
white
are
faint
on
black
strong
grey
on
black
seen
through
the
prism
will
exhibit
the
same
appearances
as
white
on
black
the
edges
are
coloured
according
to
the
same
law
only
the
borders
appear
fainter
if
we
relieve
grey
on
white
we
have
the
same
edges
and
borders
which
would
be
produced
if
we
saw
black
on
white
through
the
note
o
various
shades
of
grey
placed
next
each
other
in
gradation
will
exhibit
at
their
edges
either
blue
and
violet
only
or
red
and
yellow
only
according
as
the
darker
grey
is
placed
over
or
under
a
series
of
such
shades
of
grey
placed
horizontally
next
each
other
will
be
coloured
conformably
to
the
same
law
according
as
the
whole
series
is
relieved
on
a
black
or
white
ground
above
or
below
the
observer
may
see
the
phenomena
exhibited
by
the
prism
at
one
glance
by
enlarging
the
plate
intended
to
illustrate
this
section
it
is
of
great
importance
duly
to
examine
and
consider
another
experiment
in
which
a
grey
object
is
placed
partly
on
a
black
and
partly
on
a
white
surface
so
that
the
line
of
division
passes
vertically
through
the
object
the
colours
will
appear
on
this
grey
object
in
conformity
with
the
usual
law
but
according
to
the
opposite
relation
of
the
light
to
the
dark
and
will
be
contrasted
in
a
line
for
as
the
grey
is
as
a
light
to
the
black
so
it
exhibits
the
red
and
yellow
above
the
blue
and
violet
below
again
as
the
grey
is
as
a
dark
to
the
white
the
blue
and
violet
appear
above
the
red
and
yellow
below
this
experiment
will
be
found
of
great
importance
with
reference
to
the
next
chapter
it
has
been
thought
unnecessary
to
give
all
the
examples
in
the
plate
alluded
to
but
the
leading
instance
referred
to
in
the
next
paragraph
will
be
found
in
plate
fig
the
grey
square
when
seen
through
a
prism
will
exhibit
the
effects
described
in
par
t
xviii
coloured
objects
displaced
by
refraction
an
unlimited
coloured
surface
exhibits
no
prismatic
colour
in
addition
to
its
own
hue
thus
not
at
all
differing
from
a
black
white
or
grey
surface
to
produce
the
appearance
of
colour
light
and
dark
boundaries
must
act
on
it
either
accidentally
or
by
contrivance
hence
experiments
and
observations
on
coloured
surfaces
as
seen
through
the
prism
can
only
be
made
when
such
surfaces
are
separated
by
an
outline
from
another
differently
tinted
surface
in
short
when
are
coloured
all
colours
whatever
they
may
be
correspond
so
far
with
grey
that
they
appear
darker
than
white
and
lighter
than
black
this
quality
of
colour
σκιέρον
has
been
already
alluded
to
and
will
become
more
and
more
evident
if
then
we
begin
by
placing
coloured
objects
on
black
and
white
surfaces
and
examine
them
through
the
prism
we
shall
again
have
all
that
we
have
seen
exhibited
with
grey
surfaces
illustration
if
we
displace
a
coloured
object
by
refraction
there
appears
as
in
the
case
of
colourless
objects
and
according
to
the
same
laws
an
accessory
image
this
accessory
image
retains
as
far
as
colour
is
concerned
its
usual
nature
and
acts
on
one
side
as
a
blue
and
on
the
opposite
side
as
a
yellow
and
hence
the
apparent
colour
of
the
edge
and
border
will
be
either
homogeneous
with
the
real
colour
of
the
object
or
not
so
in
the
first
case
the
apparent
image
identifies
itself
with
the
real
one
and
appears
to
increase
it
while
in
the
second
case
the
real
image
may
be
vitiated
rendered
indistinct
and
reduced
in
size
by
the
apparent
image
we
proceed
to
review
the
cases
in
which
these
effects
are
most
strikingly
exhibited
if
we
take
a
coloured
drawing
enlarged
from
the
plate
which
illustrates
this
experiment
and
examine
the
red
and
blue
squares
placed
next
each
other
on
a
black
ground
through
the
prism
as
usual
we
shall
find
that
as
both
colours
are
lighter
than
the
ground
similarly
coloured
edges
and
borders
will
appear
above
and
below
at
the
outlines
of
both
only
they
will
not
appear
equally
distinct
to
the
eye
red
is
proportionally
much
lighter
on
black
than
blue
is
the
colours
of
the
edges
will
therefore
appear
stronger
on
the
red
than
on
the
blue
which
here
acts
as
a
but
little
different
from
black
the
extreme
red
edge
will
identify
itself
with
the
vermilion
colour
of
the
square
which
will
thus
appear
a
little
elongated
in
this
direction
while
the
yellow
border
immediately
underneath
it
only
gives
the
red
surface
a
more
brilliant
appearance
and
is
not
distinguished
without
attentive
observation
on
the
other
hand
the
red
edge
and
yellow
border
are
heterogeneous
with
the
blue
square
a
dull
red
appears
at
the
edge
and
a
dull
green
mingles
with
the
figure
and
thus
the
blue
square
seems
at
a
hasty
glance
to
be
comparatively
diminished
on
this
side
at
the
lower
outline
of
the
two
squares
a
blue
edge
and
a
violet
border
will
appear
and
will
produce
the
contrary
effect
for
the
blue
edge
which
is
heterogeneous
with
the
warm
red
surface
will
vitiate
it
and
produce
a
neutral
colour
so
that
the
red
on
this
side
appears
comparatively
reduced
and
driven
upwards
and
the
violet
border
on
the
black
is
scarcely
perceptible
on
the
other
hand
the
blue
apparent
edge
will
identify
itself
with
the
blue
square
and
not
only
not
reduce
but
extend
it
the
blue
edge
and
even
the
violet
border
next
it
have
the
apparent
effect
of
increasing
the
surface
and
elongating
it
in
that
direction
the
effect
of
homogeneous
and
heterogeneous
edges
as
i
have
now
minutely
described
it
is
so
powerful
and
singular
that
the
two
squares
at
the
first
glance
seem
pushed
out
of
their
relative
horizontal
position
and
moved
in
opposite
directions
the
red
upwards
the
blue
downwards
but
no
one
who
is
accustomed
to
observe
experiments
in
a
certain
succession
and
respectively
to
connect
and
trace
them
will
suffer
himself
to
be
deceived
by
such
an
unreal
effect
a
just
impression
with
regard
to
this
important
phenomenon
will
however
much
depend
on
some
nice
and
even
troublesome
conditions
which
are
necessary
to
produce
the
illusion
in
question
paper
should
be
tinged
with
vermilion
or
the
best
minium
for
the
red
square
and
with
deep
indigo
for
the
blue
square
the
blue
and
red
prismatic
edges
will
then
unite
imperceptibly
with
the
real
surfaces
where
they
are
respectively
homogeneous
where
they
are
not
they
vitiate
the
colours
of
the
squares
without
producing
a
very
distinct
middle
tint
the
real
red
should
not
incline
too
much
to
yellow
otherwise
the
apparent
deep
red
edge
above
will
be
too
distinct
at
the
same
time
it
should
be
somewhat
yellow
otherwise
the
transition
to
the
yellow
border
will
be
too
observable
the
blue
must
not
be
light
otherwise
the
red
edge
will
be
visible
and
the
yellow
border
will
produce
a
too
decided
green
while
the
violet
border
underneath
would
not
give
us
the
impression
of
being
part
of
an
elongated
light
blue
square
all
this
will
be
treated
more
circumstantially
hereafter
when
we
speak
of
the
apparatus
intended
to
facilitate
the
experiments
connected
with
this
part
of
our
subject
every
inquirer
should
prepare
the
figures
himself
in
order
fairly
to
exhibit
this
specimen
of
ocular
deception
and
at
the
same
time
to
convince
himself
that
the
coloured
edges
even
in
this
case
can
not
escape
accurate
examination
meanwhile
various
other
combinations
as
exhibited
in
the
plate
are
fully
calculated
to
remove
all
doubt
on
this
point
in
the
mind
of
every
attentive
observer
if
for
instance
we
look
at
a
white
square
next
the
blue
one
on
a
black
ground
the
prismatic
hues
of
the
opposite
edges
of
the
white
which
here
occupies
the
place
of
the
red
in
the
former
experiment
will
exhibit
themselves
in
their
utmost
force
the
red
edge
extends
itself
above
the
level
of
the
blue
almost
in
a
greater
degree
than
was
the
case
with
the
red
square
itself
in
the
former
experiment
the
lower
blue
edge
again
is
visible
in
its
full
force
next
the
white
while
on
the
other
hand
it
can
not
be
distinguished
next
the
blue
square
the
violet
border
underneath
is
also
much
more
apparent
on
the
white
than
on
the
blue
if
the
observer
now
compares
these
double
squares
carefully
prepared
and
arranged
one
above
the
other
the
red
with
the
white
the
two
blue
squares
together
the
blue
with
the
red
the
blue
with
the
white
he
will
clearly
perceive
the
relations
of
these
surfaces
to
their
coloured
edges
and
borders
the
edges
and
their
relations
to
the
coloured
surfaces
appear
still
more
striking
if
we
look
at
the
coloured
squares
and
a
black
square
on
a
white
ground
for
in
this
case
the
illusion
before
mentioned
ceases
altogether
and
the
effect
of
the
edges
is
as
visible
as
in
any
case
that
has
come
under
our
observation
let
the
blue
and
red
squares
be
first
examined
through
the
prism
in
both
the
blue
edge
now
appears
above
this
edge
homogeneous
with
the
blue
surface
unites
with
it
and
appears
to
extend
it
upwards
only
the
blue
edge
owing
to
its
lightness
is
somewhat
too
distinct
in
its
upper
portion
the
violet
border
underneath
it
is
also
sufficiently
evident
on
the
blue
the
apparent
blue
edge
is
on
the
other
hand
heterogeneous
with
the
red
square
it
is
neutralised
by
contrast
and
is
scarcely
visible
meanwhile
the
violet
border
uniting
with
the
real
red
produces
a
hue
resembling
that
of
the
if
thus
owing
to
the
above
causes
the
upper
outlines
of
these
squares
do
not
appear
level
with
each
other
the
correspondence
of
the
under
outlines
is
the
more
observable
for
since
both
colours
the
red
and
the
blue
are
darks
compared
with
the
white
as
in
the
former
case
they
were
light
compared
with
the
black
the
red
edge
with
its
yellow
border
appears
very
distinctly
under
both
it
exhibits
itself
under
the
warm
red
surface
in
its
full
force
and
under
the
dark
blue
nearly
as
it
appears
under
the
black
as
may
be
seen
if
we
compare
the
edges
and
borders
of
the
figures
placed
one
above
the
other
on
the
white
ground
in
order
to
present
these
experiments
with
the
greatest
variety
and
perspicuity
squares
of
various
colours
are
so
arranged
that
the
boundary
of
the
black
and
white
passes
through
them
vertically
according
to
the
laws
now
known
to
us
especially
in
their
application
to
coloured
objects
we
shall
find
the
squares
as
usual
doubly
coloured
at
each
edge
each
square
will
appear
to
be
split
in
two
and
to
be
elongated
upwards
or
downwards
we
may
here
call
to
mind
the
experiment
with
the
grey
figure
seen
in
like
manner
on
the
line
of
division
between
black
and
white
a
phenomenon
was
before
exhibited
even
to
illusion
in
the
instance
of
a
red
and
blue
square
on
a
black
ground
in
the
present
experiment
the
elongation
upwards
and
downwards
of
two
differently
coloured
figures
is
apparent
in
the
two
halves
of
one
and
the
same
figure
of
one
and
the
same
colour
thus
we
are
still
referred
to
the
coloured
edges
and
borders
and
to
the
effects
of
their
homogeneous
and
heterogeneous
relations
with
respect
to
the
real
colours
of
the
objects
i
leave
it
to
observers
themselves
to
compare
the
various
gradations
of
coloured
squares
placed
half
on
black
half
on
white
only
inviting
their
attention
to
the
apparent
alteration
which
takes
place
in
contrary
directions
for
red
and
yellow
appear
elongated
upwards
if
on
a
black
ground
downwards
if
on
a
white
blue
downwards
if
on
a
black
ground
upwards
if
on
a
white
all
which
however
is
quite
in
accordance
with
the
diffusely
detailed
examples
above
given
let
the
observer
now
turn
the
figures
so
that
the
squares
placed
on
the
line
of
division
between
black
and
white
may
be
in
a
horizontal
series
the
black
above
the
white
underneath
on
looking
at
these
squares
through
the
prism
he
will
observe
that
the
red
square
gains
by
the
addition
of
two
red
edges
on
more
accurate
examination
he
will
observe
the
yellow
border
on
the
red
figure
and
the
lower
yellow
border
upon
the
white
will
be
perfectly
apparent
the
upper
red
edge
on
the
blue
square
is
on
the
other
hand
hardly
visible
the
yellow
border
next
it
produces
a
dull
green
by
mingling
with
the
figure
the
lower
red
edge
and
the
yellow
border
are
displayed
in
lively
colours
after
observing
that
the
red
figure
in
these
cases
appears
to
gain
by
an
addition
on
both
sides
while
the
dark
blue
on
one
side
at
least
loses
something
we
shall
see
the
contrary
effect
produced
by
turning
the
same
figures
upside
down
so
that
the
white
ground
be
above
the
black
below
for
as
the
homogeneous
edges
and
borders
now
appear
above
and
below
the
blue
square
this
appears
elongated
and
a
portion
of
the
surface
itself
seems
even
more
brilliantly
coloured
it
is
only
by
attentive
observation
that
we
can
distinguish
the
edges
and
borders
from
the
colour
of
the
figure
itself
the
yellow
and
red
squares
on
the
other
hand
are
comparatively
reduced
by
the
heterogeneous
edges
in
this
position
of
the
figures
and
their
colours
are
to
a
certain
extent
vitiated
the
blue
edge
in
both
is
almost
invisible
the
violet
border
appears
as
a
beautiful
hue
on
the
red
as
a
very
pale
colour
of
the
same
kind
on
the
yellow
both
the
lower
edges
are
green
dull
on
the
red
vivid
on
the
yellow
the
violet
border
is
but
faintly
perceptible
under
the
red
but
is
more
apparent
under
the
yellow
every
inquirer
should
make
it
a
point
to
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
all
the
appearances
here
adduced
and
not
consider
it
irksome
to
follow
out
a
single
phenomenon
through
so
many
modifying
circumstances
these
experiments
it
is
true
may
be
multiplied
to
infinity
by
differently
coloured
figures
upon
and
between
differently
coloured
grounds
under
all
such
circumstances
however
it
will
be
evident
to
every
attentive
observer
that
coloured
squares
only
appear
relatively
altered
or
elongated
or
reduced
by
the
prism
because
an
addition
of
homogeneous
or
heterogeneous
edges
produces
an
illusion
the
inquirer
will
now
be
enabled
to
do
away
with
this
illusion
if
he
has
the
patience
to
go
through
the
experiments
one
after
the
other
always
comparing
the
effects
together
and
satisfying
himself
of
their
correspondence
experiments
with
coloured
objects
might
have
been
contrived
in
various
ways
why
they
have
been
exhibited
precisely
in
the
above
mode
and
with
so
much
minuteness
will
be
seen
hereafter
the
phenomena
although
formerly
not
unknown
were
much
misunderstood
and
it
was
necessary
to
investigate
them
thoroughly
to
render
some
portions
of
our
intended
historical
view
clearer
in
conclusion
we
will
mention
a
contrivance
by
means
of
which
our
scientific
readers
may
be
enabled
to
see
these
appearances
distinctly
at
one
view
and
even
in
their
greatest
splendour
cut
in
a
piece
of
pasteboard
five
perfectly
similar
square
openings
of
about
an
inch
next
each
other

in
a
horizontal
line
behind
these
openings
place
five
coloured
glasses

the
natural
order

let
the
series
thus
adjusted
be
fastened
in
an
opening
of
the
camera
obscura
so
that
the
bright
sky
may
be
seen
through
the
squares
or
that
the
sun
may
shine
on
them
they
will
thus
appear
very
powerfully
coloured
let
the
spectator
now
examine
them
through
the
prism
and
observe
the
appearances
already
familiar
by
the
foregoing
experiments
with
coloured
objects
namely
the
partly
assisting
partly
neutralising
effects
of
the
edges
and
borders
and
the
consequent
apparent
elongation
or
reduction
of
the
coloured
squares
with
reference
to
the
horizontal
line
the
results
witnessed
by
the
observer
in
this
case
entirely
correspond
with
those
in
the
cases
before
analysed
we
do
not
therefore
go
through
them
again
in
detail
especially
as
we
shall
find
frequent
occasions
hereafter

achromatism
and
hyperchromatism
formerly
when
much
that
is
regular
and
constant
in
nature
was
considered
as
mere
aberration
and
accident
the
colours
arising
from
refraction
were
but
little
attended
to
and
were
looked
upon
as
an
appearance
attributable
to
particular
local
circumstances
but
after
it
had
been
assumed
that
this
appearance
of
colour
accompanies
refraction
at
all
times
it
was
natural
that
it
should
be
considered
as
intimately
and
exclusively
connected
with
that
phenomenon
the
belief
obtaining
that
the
measure
of
the
coloured
appearance
was
in
proportion
to
the
measure
of
the
refraction
and
that
they
must
advance
with
each
other
if
again
philosophers
ascribed
the
phenomenon
of
a
stronger
or
weaker
refraction
not
indeed
wholly
but
in
some
degree
to
the
different
density
of
the
medium
as
purer
atmospheric
air
air
charged
with
vapours
water
glass
according
to
their
increasing
density
increase
the
refraction
or
displacement
of
the
object
so
they
could
hardly
doubt
that
the
appearance
of
colour
must
increase
in
the
same
proportion
and
hence
took
it
for
granted
in
combining
different
mediums
which
were
to
counteract
refraction
that
as
long
as
refraction
existed
the
appearance
of
colour
must
take
place
and
that
as
soon
as
the
colour
disappeared
the
refraction
also
must
cease
afterwards
it
was
however
discovered
that
this
relation
which
was
assumed
to
correspond
was
in
fact
dissimilar
that
two
mediums
can
refract
an
object
with
equal
power
and
yet
produce
very
dissimilar
coloured
borders
it
was
found
that
in
addition
to
the
physical
principle
to
which
refraction
was
ascribed
a
chemical
one
was
also
to
be
taken
into
the
account
we
propose
to
pursue
this
subject
hereafter
in
the
chemical
division
of
our
inquiry
and
we
shall
have
to
describe
the
particulars
of
this
important
discovery
in
our
history
of
the
doctrine
of
colours
what
follows
may
suffice
for
the
present
in
mediums
of
similar
or
nearly
similar
refracting
power
we
find
the
remarkable
circumstance
that
a
greater
and
lesser
appearance
of
colour
can
be
produced
by
a
chemical
treatment
the
greater
effect
is
owing
namely
to
acids
the
lesser
to
alkalis
if
metallic
oxydes
are
introduced
into
a
common
mass
of
glass
the
coloured
appearance
through
such
glasses
becomes
greatly
increased
without
any
perceptible
change
of
refracting
power
that
the
lesser
effect
again
is
produced
by
alkalis
may
be
easily
supposed
those
kinds
of
glass
which
were
first
employed
after
the
discovery
are
called
flint
and
crown
glass
the
first
produces
the
stronger
the
second
the
fainter
appearance
of
colour
we
shall
make
use
of
both
these
denominations
as
technical
terms
in
our
present
statement
and
assume
that
the
refractive
power
of
both
is
the
same
but
that
produces
the
coloured
appearance
more
strongly
by
than
the
the
diagram
plate
fig
may
serve
in
illustration
a
black
surface
is
here
divided
into
compartments
for
more
convenient
demonstration
let
the
spectator
imagine
five
white
squares
between
the
parallel
lines
b
and
the
square
no
is
presented
to
the
naked
eye
unmoved
from
its
place
but
let
the
square
no
seen
through
a
prism
be
supposed
to
be
displaced
by
refraction
three
compartments
exhibiting
the
coloured
borders
to
a
certain
extent
again
let
the
square
no
seen
through
a
flint
glass
prism
in
like
manner
be
moved
downwards
three
compartments
when
it
will
exhibit
the
coloured
borders
by
about
a
third
wider
than
no
again
let
us
suppose
that
the
square
no
has
like
no
been
moved
downwards
three
compartments
by
a
prism
of
and
that
then
by
an
oppositely
placed
prism
of
it
has
been
again
raised
to
its
former
situation
where
it
now
stands
here
it
is
true
the
refraction
is
done
away
with
by
the
opposition
of
the
two
but
as
the
prism
in
displacing
the
square
by
refraction
through
three
compartments
produces
coloured
borders
wider
by
a
third
than
those
produced
by
the
prism
so
notwithstanding
the
refraction
is
neutralised
there
must
be
an
excess
of
coloured
border
remaining
the
position
of
this
colour
as
usual
depends
on
the
direction
of
the
apparent
motion
communicated
to
the
square
by
the
prism
and
consequently
it
is
the
reverse
of
the
appearance
in
the
two
squares
and
which
have
been
moved
in
an
opposite
direction
this
excess
of
colour
we
have
called
hyperchromatism
and
from
this
the
achromatic
state
may
be
immediately
arrived
at
for
assuming
that
it
was
the
square
no
which
was
removed
three
compartments
from
its
first
supposed
place
like
no
by
a
prism
of
it
would
only
be
necessary
to
reduce
the
angle
of
a
prism
of
and
to
connect
it
reversed
to
the
prism
in
order
to
raise
the
square
no
two
degrees
or
compartments
by
which
means
the
hyperchromatism
of
the
first
case
would
cease
the
figure
would
not
quite
return
to
its
first
position
and
yet
be
already
colourless
the
prolonged
lines
of
the
united
prisms
under
no
show
that
a
single
complete
prism
remains
again
we
have
only
to
suppose
the
lines
curved
and
an
presents
itself
such
is
the
principle
of
the
achromatic
telescopes
for
these
experiments
a
small
prism
composed
of
three
different
prisms
as
prepared
in
england
is
extremely
well
adapted
it
is
to
be
hoped
our
own
opticians
will
in
future
enable
every
friend
of
science
to
provide
himself
with
this
necessary
instrument
xx
advantages
of
subjective
transition
to
the
objective
we
have
presented
the
appearances
of
colour
as
exhibited
by
refraction
first
by
means
of
subjective
experiments
and
we
have
so
far
arrived
at
a
definite
result
that
we
have
been
enabled
to
deduce
the
phenomena
in
question
from
the
doctrine
of
mediums
and
double
images
in
statements
which
have
reference
to
nature
everything
depends
on
ocular
inspection
and
these
experiments
are
the
more
satisfactory
as
they
may
be
easily
and
conveniently
made
every
amateur
can
procure
his
apparatus
without
much
trouble
or
cost
and
if
he
is
a
tolerable
adept
in
pasteboard
contrivances
he
may
even
prepare
a
great
part
of
his
machinery
himself
a
few
plain
surfaces
on
which
black
white
grey
and
coloured
objects
may
be
exhibited
alternately
on
a
light
and
dark
ground
are
all
that
is
necessary
the
spectator
fixes
them
before
him
examines
the
appearances
at
the
edge
of
the
figures
conveniently
and
as
long
as
he
pleases
he
retires
to
a
greater
distance
again
approaches
and
accurately
observes
the
progressive
states
of
the
phenomena
besides
this
the
appearances
may
be
observed
with
sufficient
exactness
through
small
prisms
which
need
not
be
of
the
purest
glass
the
other
desirable
requisites
in
these
glass
instruments
will
however
be
pointed
out
in
the
section
which
treats
of
the
apparatus
a
great
advantage
in
these
experiments
again
is
that
they
can
be
made
at
any
hour
of
the
day
in
any
room
whatever
aspect
it
may
have
we
have
no
need
to
wait
for
sunshine
which
in
general
is
not
very
propitious
to
northern
observers
this
description
of
the
apparatus
was
never
given
objective
experiments
the
objective
experiments
on
the
contrary
necessarily
require
the
which
even
when
it
is
to
be
had
may
not
always
have
the
most
desirable
relation
with
the
apparatus
placed
opposite
to
it
sometimes
the
sun
is
too
high
sometimes
too
low
and
withal
only
a
short
time
in
the
meridian
of
the
best
situated
room
it
changes
its
direction
during
the
observation
the
observer
is
forced
to
alter
his
own
position
and
that
of
his
apparatus
in
consequence
of
which
the
experiments
in
many
cases
become
uncertain
if
the
sun
shines
through
the
prism
it
exhibits
all
inequalities
lines
and
bubbles
in
the
glass
and
thus
the
appearance
is
rendered
confused
dim
and
discoloured
yet
both
kinds
of
experiments
must
be
investigated
with
equal
accuracy
they
appear
to
be
opposed
to
each
other
and
yet
are
always
parallel
what
one
order
of
experiments
exhibits
the
other
exhibits
likewise
and
yet
each
has
its
peculiar
capabilities
by
means
of
which
certain
effects
of
nature
are
made
known
to
us
in
more
than
one
way
in
the
next
place
there
are
important
phenomena
which
may
be
exhibited
by
the
union
of
subjective
and
objective
experiments
the
latter
experiments
again
have
this
advantage
that
we
can
in
most
cases
represent
them
by
diagrams
and
present
to
view
the
component
relations
of
the
phenomena
in
proceeding
therefore
to
describe
the
objective
experiments
we
shall
so
arrange
them
that
they
may
always
correspond
with
the
analogous
subjective
examples
for
this
reason
too
we
annex
to
the
number
of
each
paragraph
the
number
of
the
former
corresponding
one
but
we
set
out
by
observing
generally
that
the
reader
must
consult
the
plates
that
the
scientific
investigator
must
be
familiar
with
the
apparatus
in
order
that
the
in
one
mode
or
the
other
may
be
placed
before
them
xxi
refraction
without
the
appearance
of
colour
that
refraction
may
exhibit
its
effects
without
producing
an
appearance
of
colour
is
not
to
be
demonstrated
so
perfectly
in
objective
as
in
subjective
experiments
we
have
it
is
true
unlimited
spaces
which
we
can
look
at
through
the
prism
and
thus
convince
ourselves
that
no
colour
appears
where
there
is
no
boundary
but
we
have
no
unlimited
source
of
light
which
we
can
cause
to
act
through
the
prism
our
light
comes
to
us
from
circumscribed
bodies
and
the
sun
which
chiefly
produces
our
prismatic
appearances
is
itself
only
a
small
circumscribed
luminous
object
we
may
however
consider
every
larger
opening
through
which
the
sun
shines
every
larger
medium
through
which
the
is
transmitted
and
made
to
deviate
from
its
course
as
so
far
unlimited
that
we
can
confine
our
attention
to
the
centre
of
the
surface
without
considering
its
boundaries
if
we
place
a
large
in
the
sun
a
large
bright
space
is
refracted
upwards
by
it
on
the
plane
intended
to
receive
the
image
and
the
middle
of
this
illumined
space
will
be
colourless
the
same
effect
may
be
produced
if
we
make
the
experiment
with
glass
prisms
having
angles
of
few
degrees
the
appearance
may
be
produced
even
through
glass
prisms
whose
refracting
angle
is
sixty
degrees
provided
we
place
the
recipient
surface
near
enough
xxii
conditions
of
the
appearance
of
colour
although
then
the
illumined
space
before
mentioned
appears
indeed
refracted
and
moved
from
its
place
but
not
coloured
yet
on
the
horizontal
edges
of
this
space
we
observe
a
coloured
appearance
that
here
again
the
colour
is
solely
owing
to
the
displacement
of
a
circumscribed
object
may
require
to
be
more
fully
proved
the
luminous
body
which
here
acts
is
circumscribed
the
sun
while
it
shines
and
diffuses
light
is
still
an
insulated
object
however
small
the
opening
in
the
lid
of
a
camera
obscura
be
made
still
the
whole
image
of
the
sun
will
penetrate
it
the
light
which
streams
from
all
parts
of
the
sun
disk
will
cross
itself
in
the
smallest
opening
and
form
the
angle
which
corresponds
with
the
sun
apparent
diameter
on
the
outside
we
have
a
cone
narrowing
to
the
orifice
within
this
apex
spreads
again
producing
on
an
opposite
surface
a
round
image
which
still
increases
in
size
in
proportion
to
the
distance
of
the
recipient
surface
from
the
apex
this
image
together
with
all
other
objects
of
the
external
landscape
appears
reversed
on
the
white
surface
in
question
in
a
dark
room
how
little
therefore
we
have
here
to
do
with
single
bundles
or
fasces
of
rays
cylinders
of
rays
pencils
or
whatever
else
of
the
kind
may
be
imagined
is
strikingly
evident
for
the
convenience
of
certain
diagrams
the
may
be
assumed
to
arrive
in
parallel
lines
but
it
is
known
that
this
is
only
a
fiction
a
fiction
quite
allowable
where
the
difference
between
the
assumption
and
the
true
appearance
is
unimportant
but
we
should
take
care
not
to
suffer
such
a
postulate
to
be
equivalent
to
a
fact
and
proceed
to
further
operations
on
such
a
fictitious
basis
let
the
aperture
in
the
be
now
enlarged
at
pleasure
let
it
be
made
round
or
square
nay
let
the
whole
shutter
be
opened
and
let
the
sun
shine
into
the
room
through
the
whole
window
the
space
which
the
sun
illumines
will
always
be
larger
according
to
the
angle
which
its
diameter
makes
and
thus
even
the
whole
space
illumined
by
the
sun
through
the
largest
window
is
only
the
image
of
the
sun
the
size
of
the
opening
we
shall
hereafter
have
occasion
to
return
to
this
if
we
transmit
the
image
of
the
sun
through
convex
glasses
we
contract
it
towards
the
focus
in
this
case
according
to
the
laws
before
explained
a
yellow
border
and
a
edge
must
appear
when
the
spectrum
is
thrown
on
white
paper
but
as
this
experiment
is
dazzling
and
inconvenient
it
may
be
made
more
agreeably
with
the
image
of
the
full
moon
on
contracting
this
orb
by
means
of
a
convex
glass
the
coloured
edge
appears
in
the
greatest
splendour
for
the
moon
transmits
a
mitigated
light
in
the
first
instance
and
can
thus
the
more
readily
produce
colour
which
to
a
certain
extent
accompanies
the
subduing
of
light
at
the
same
time
the
eye
of
the
observer
is
only
gently
and
agreeably
excited
if
we
transmit
a
luminous
image
through
concave
glasses
it
is
dilated
here
the
image
appears
edged
with
blue
the
two
opposite
appearances
may
be
produced
by
a
convex
glass
simultaneously
or
in
succession
simultaneously
by
fastening
an
opaque
disk
in
the
centre
of
the
convex
glass
and
then
transmitting
the
image
in
this
case
the
luminous
image
and
the
black
disk
within
it
are
both
contracted
and
consequently
the
opposite
colours
must
appear
again
we
can
present
this
contrast
in
succession
by
first
contracting
the
luminous
image
towards
the
focus
and
then
suffering
it
to
expand
again
beyond
the
focus
when
it
will
immediately
exhibit
a
blue
edge
here
too
what
was
observed
in
the
subjective
experiments
is
again
to
be
remarked
namely
that
blue
and
yellow
appear
in
and
upon
the
white
and
that
both
assume
a
reddish
appearance
in
proportion
as
they
mingle
with
the
black
these
elementary
phenomena
occur
in
all
subsequent
objective
experiments
as
they
constituted
the
groundwork
of
the
subjective
ones
the
process
too
which
takes
place
is
the
same
a
light
boundary
is
carried
over
a
dark
surface
a
dark
surface
is
carried
over
a
light
boundary
the
edges
must
advance
and
as
it
were
push
over
each
other
in
these
experiments
as
in
the
former
ones
if
we
admit
the
sun
image
through
a
larger
or
smaller
opening
into
the
dark
room
if
we
transmit
it
through
a
prism
so
placed
that
its
refracting
angle
as
usual
is
underneath
the
luminous
image
instead
of
proceeding
in
a
straight
line
to
the
floor
is
refracted
upwards
on
a
vertical
surface
placed
to
receive
it
this
is
the
moment
to
take
notice
of
the
opposite
modes
in
which
the
subjective
and
objective
refractions
of
the
object
appear
if
we
through
a
prism
held
with
its
refracting
angle
underneath
at
an
object
above
us
the
object
is
moved
downwards
whereas
a
luminous
image
refracted
through
the
same
prism
is
moved
upwards
this
which
we
here
merely
mention
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
the
sake
of
brevity
is
easily
explained
by
the
laws
of
refraction
and
elevation
the
luminous
object
being
moved
from
its
place
in
this
manner
the
coloured
borders
appear
in
the
order
and
according
to
the
laws
before
explained
the
violet
border
is
always
foremost
and
thus
in
objective
cases
proceeds
upwards
in
subjective
cases
downwards
the
observer
may
convince
himself
in
like
manner
of
the
mode
in
which
the
appearance
of
colour
takes
place
in
the
diagonal
direction
when
the
displacement
is
effected
by
means
of
two
prisms
as
has
been
plainly
enough
shown
in
the
subjective
example
for
this
experiment
however
prisms
should
be
procured
of
few
degrees
say
about
fifteen
that
the
colouring
of
the
image
takes
place
here
too
according
to
the
direction
in
which
it
moves
will
be
apparent
if
we
make
a
opening
of
moderate
size
in
a
shutter
and
cause
the
luminous
image
to
pass
through
a
the
spectrum
being
moved
first
in
the
horizontal
and
vertical
directions
then
diagonally
the
coloured
edges
will
change
their
position
accordingly
whence
it
is
again
evident
that
to
produce
colour
the
boundaries
must
be
carried
over
each
other
not
merely
move
side
by
side
xxiii
conditions
of
the
increase
of
colour
here
too
an
increased
displacement
of
the
object
produces
a
greater
appearance
of
colour
this
increased
displacement
occurs
by
a
more
oblique
direction
of
the
impinging
luminous
object
through
mediums
with
parallel
surfaces
by
changing
the
parallel
form
for
one
more
or
less
acute
angled
by
increased
proportion
of
the
medium
whether
parallel
or
acute
angled
partly
because
the
object
is
by
this
means
more
powerfully
displaced
partly
because
an
effect
depending
on
the
mere
mass
by
the
distance
of
the
recipient
surface
from
the
refracting
medium
so
that
the
coloured
spectrum
emerging
from
the
prism
may
be
said
to
have
a
longer
way
to
travel
when
a
chemical
property
produces
its
effects
under
all
these
circumstances
this
we
have
already
entered
into
more
fully
under
the
head
of
achromatism
and
hyperchromatism
the
objective
experiments
have
this
advantage
that
the
progressive
states
of
the
phenomenon
may
be
arrested
and
clearly
represented
by
diagrams
which
is
not
the
case
with
the
subjective
experiments
we
can
observe
the
luminous
image
after
it
has
emerged
from
the
prism
step
by
step
and
mark
its
increasing
colour
by
receiving
it
on
a
plane
at
different
distances
thus
exhibiting
before
our
eyes
various
sections
of
this
cone
with
an
elliptical
base
again
the
phenomenon
may
at
once
be
rendered
beautifully
visible
throughout
its
whole
course
in
the
following
manner
let
a
cloud
of
fine
white
dust
be
excited
along
the
line
in
which
the
image
passes
through
the
dark
space
the
cloud
is
best
produced
by
fine
perfectly
dry
the
more
or
less
coloured
appearance
will
now
be
painted
on
the
white
atoms
and
presented
in
its
whole
length
and
breadth
to
the
eye
of
the
spectator
by
this
means
we
have
prepared
some
diagrams
which
will
be
found
among
the
plates
in
these
the
appearance
is
exhibited
from
its
first
origin
and
by
these
the
spectator
can
clearly
comprehend
why
the
luminous
image
is
so
much
more
powerfully
coloured
through
prisms
than
through
parallel
mediums
at
the
two
opposite
outlines
of
the
image
an
opposite
appearance
presents
itself
beginning
from
an
acute
angle
the
appearance
spreads
as
it
proceeds
further
in
space
according
to
this
angle
on
one
side
in
the
direction
in
which
the
luminous
image
is
moved
a
violet
border
advances
on
the
dark
a
narrower
blue
edge
remains
next
the
outline
of
the
image
on
the
opposite
side
a
yellow
border
advances
into
the
light
of
the
image
itself
and
a
edge
remains
at
the
outline
here
therefore
the
movement
of
the
dark
against
the
light
of
the
light
against
the
dark
may
be
clearly
observed
illustration
the
centre
of
a
large
object
remains
long
uncoloured
especially
with
mediums
of
less
density
and
smaller
angles
but
at
last
the
opposite
borders
and
edges
touch
each
other
upon
which
a
green
appears
in
the
centre
of
the
luminous
image
objective
experiments
have
been
usually
made
with
the
sun
image
an
objective
experiment
with
a
dark
object
has
hitherto
scarcely
been
thought
of
we
have
however
prepared
a
convenient
contrivance
for
this
also
let
the
large
before
alluded
to
be
placed
in
the
sun
and
let
a
round
pasteboard
disk
be
fastened
either
inside
or
outside
the
coloured
appearance
will
again
take
place
at
the
outline
beginning
according
to
the
usual
law
the
edges
will
appear
they
will
spread
in
the
same
proportion
and
when
they
meet
red
will
appear
in
the
centre
an
intercepting
square
may
be
added
near
the
round
disk
and
placed
in
any
direction
and
the
spectator
can
again
convince
himself
of
what
has
been
before
so
often
described
if
we
take
away
these
dark
objects
from
the
prism
in
which
case
however
the
glass
is
to
be
carefully
cleaned
and
hold
a
rod
or
a
large
pencil
before
the
centre
of
the
horizontal
prism
we
shall
then
accomplish
the
complete
immixture
of
the
violet
border
and
the
edge
and
see
only
the
three
colours
the
external
blue
and
yellow
and
the
central
red
if
again
we
cut
a
long
horizontal
opening
in
the
middle
of
a
piece
of
pasteboard
fastened
on
the
prism
and
then
cause
the
to
pass
through
it
we
shall
accomplish
the
complete
union
of
the
yellow
border
with
the
blue
edge

see
green
and
violet
the
details
of
this
are
further
entered
into
in
the
description
of
the
plates
the
prismatic
appearance
is
thus
by
no
means
complete
and
final
when
the
luminous
image
emerges
from
the
prism
it
is
then
only
that
we
perceive
its
elements
in
contrast

as
it
increases
these
contrasting
elements
unite
and
are
at

joined
the

of
this

arrested
on
a

surface

different
at
every
degree
of

from

that
the
notion
of
an
immutable
series
of
colours
or
of
a
pervading
similar
proportion
between
them
can
not
be
a
question

explanation
of
the
foregoing
phenomena
as
we
have
already
entered
into
this
analysis
circumstantially
while
treating
of
the
subjective
experiments
as
all
that
was
of
force
there
is
equally
valid
here
it
will
require
no
long
details
in
addition
to
show
that
the
phenomena
which
are
entirely
parallel
in
the
two
cases
may
also
be
traced
precisely
to
the
same
sources
that
in
objective
experiments
also
we
have
to
do
with
circumscribed
images
has
been
already
demonstrated
at
large
the
sun
may
shine
through
the
smallest
opening
yet
the
image
of
the
whole
disk
penetrates
beyond
the
largest
prism
may
be
placed
in
the
open
yet
it
is
still
the
sun
image
that
is
bounded
by
the
edges
of
the
refracting
surfaces
and
produces
the
accessory
images
of
this
boundary
we
may
fasten
pasteboard
with
many
openings
cut
in
it
before
the
yet
we
still
merely
see
multiplied
images
which
after
having
been
moved
from
their
place
by
refraction
exhibit
coloured
edges
and
borders
and
in
these
mere
accessory
images
in
subjective
experiments
we
have
seen
that
objects
strongly
relieved
from
each
other
produce
a
very
lively
appearance
of
colour
and
this
will
be
the
case
in
objective
experiments
in
a
much
more
vivid
and
splendid
degree
the
sun
image
is
the
most
powerful
brightness
we
know
hence
its
accessory
image
will
be
energetic
in
proportion
and
notwithstanding
its
really
secondary
dimmed
and
darkened
character
must
be
still
very
brilliant
the
colours
thrown
by
the
through
the
prism
on
any
object
carry
a
powerful
light
with
them
for
they
have
the
highest
and
most
intense
source
of
light
as
it
were
for
their
ground
that
we
are
warranted
in
calling
even
these
accessory
images
thus
deducing
the
appearances
from
the
doctrine
of
the
mediums
will
be
clear
to
every
one
who
has
followed
us
thus
far
but
particularly
to
those
who
have
supplied
themselves
with
the
necessary
apparatus
so
as
to
be
enabled
at
all
times
to
witness
the
precision
and
vivacity
with
which
mediums
act
xxv
decrease
of
the
appearance
of
colour
if
we
could
afford
to
be
concise
in
the
description
of
the
decreasing
coloured
appearance
in
subjective
cases
we
may
here
be
permitted
to
proceed
with
still
greater
brevity
while
we
refer
to
the
former
distinct
statement
one
circumstance
only
on
account
of
its
great
importance
may
be
here
recommended
to
the
reader
especial
attention
as
a
leading
point
of
our
whole
thesis
the
decline
of
the
prismatic
appearance
must
be
preceded
by
its
separation
by
its
resolution
into
its
elements
at
a
due
distance
from
the
prism
the
image
of
the
sun
being
entirely
coloured
the
blue
and
yellow
at
length
mix
completely
and
we
see
only
green
and
if
we
bring
the
recipient
surface
nearer
to
the
refracting
medium
yellow
and
blue
appear
again
and
we
see
the
five
colours
with
their
gradations
at
a
still
shorter
distance
the
yellow
and
blue
separate
from
each
other
entirely
the
green
vanishes
and
the
image
itself
appears
colourless
between
the
coloured
edges
and
borders
the
nearer
we
bring
the
recipient
surface
to
the
prism
the
narrower
the
edges
and
borders
become
till
at
last
when
in
contact
with
the
prism
they
are
reduced
to
nothing
xxvi
grey
objects
we
have
exhibited
grey
objects
as
very
important
to
our
inquiry
in
the
subjective
experiments
they
show
by
the
faintness
of
the
accessory
images
that
these
same
images
are
in
all
cases
derived
from
the
principal
object
if
we
wish
here
too
to
carry
on
the
objective
experiments
parallel
with
the
others
we
may
conveniently
do
this
by
placing
a
more
or
less
dull
ground
glass
before
the
opening
through
which
the
sun
image
enters
by
this
means
a
subdued
image
would
be
produced
which
on
being
refracted
would
exhibit
much
duller
colours
on
the
recipient
plane
than
those
immediately
derived
from
the
sun
disk
and
thus
even
from
the
intense
only
a
faint
accessory
image
would
appear
proportioned
to
the
mitigation
of
the
light
by
the
glass
this
experiment
it
is
true
will
only
again
and
again
confirm
what
is
already
sufficiently
familiar
to
us
xxvii
coloured
objects
there
are
various
modes
of
producing
coloured
images
in
objective
experiments
in
the
first
place
we
can
fix
coloured
glass
before
the
opening
by
which
means
a
coloured
image
is
at
once
produced
secondly
we
can
fill
the
with
coloured
fluids
thirdly
we
can
cause
the
colours
already
produced
in
their
full
vivacity
by
the
prism
to
pass
through
proportionate
small
openings
in
a
tin
plate
and
thus
prepare
small
circumscribed
colours
for
a
second
operation
this
last
mode
is
the
most
difficult
for
owing
to
the
continual
progress
of
the
sun
the
image
can
not
be
arrested
in
any
direction
at
will
the
second
method
has
also
its
inconveniences
since
not
all
coloured
liquids
can
be
prepared
perfectly
bright
and
clear
on
these
accounts
the
first
is
to
be
preferred
and
deserves
the
more
to
be
adopted
because
natural
philosophers
have
hitherto
chosen
to
consider
the
colours
produced
from
the
through
the
prism
those
produced
through
liquids
and
glasses
and
those
which
are
already
fixed
on
paper
or
cloth
as
exhibiting
effects
equally
to
be
depended
on
and
equally
available
in
demonstration
as
it
is
thus
merely
necessary
that
the
image
should
be
coloured
so
the
large
before
alluded
to
affords
us
the
best
means
of
effecting
this
a
pasteboard
screen
may
be
contrived
to
slide
before
the
large
surfaces
of
the
prism
through
which
in
the
first
instance
the
light
passes
uncoloured
in
this
screen
openings
of
various
forms
may
be
cut
in
order
to
produce
different
images
and
consequently
different
accessory
images
this
being
done
we
need
only
fix
coloured
glasses
before
the
openings
in
order
to
observe
what
effect
refraction
produces
on
coloured
images
in
an
objective
sense
a
series
of
glasses
may
be
prepared
in
a
mode
similar
to
that
before
described
these
should
be
accurately
contrived
to
slide
in
the
grooves
of
the
large
let
the
sun
then
shine
through
them
and
the
coloured
images
refracted
upwards
will
appear
bordered
and
edged
and
will
vary
accordingly
for
these
borders
and
edges
will
be
exhibited
quite
distinctly
on
some
images
and
on
others
will
be
mixed
with
the
specific
colour
of
the
glass
which
they
will
either
enhance
or
neutralize
every
observer
will
be
enabled
to
convince
himself
here
again
that
we
have
only
to
do
with
the
same
simple
phenomenon
so
circumstantially
described
subjectively
and
objectively
xxviii
achromatism
and
hyperchromatism
it
is
possible
to
make
the
hyperchromatic
and
achromatic
experiments
objectively
as
well
as
subjectively
after
what
has
been
already
stated
a
short
description
of
the
method
will
suffice
especially
as
we
take
it
for
granted
that
the
compound
prism
before
mentioned
is
in
the
hands
of
the
observer
let
the
sun
image
pass
through
an
prism
of
few
degrees
prepared
from
so
that
the
spectrum
be
refracted
upwards
on
an
opposite
surface
the
edges
will
appear
coloured
according
to
the
constant
law
namely
the
violet
and
blue
above
and
outside
the
yellow
and
below
and
within
the
image
as
the
refracting
angle
of
this
prism
is
undermost
let
another
proportionate
prism
of
be
placed
against
it
with
its
refracting
angle
uppermost
the
image
will
by
this
means
be
again
moved
to
its
place
where
owing
to
the
excess
of
the
colouring
power
of
the
prism
of
it
will
still
appear
a
little
coloured
and
in
consequence
of
the
direction
in
which
it
has
been
moved
the
blue
and
violet
will
now
appear
underneath
and
outside
the
yellow
and
above
and
inside
if
the
whole
image
be
now
moved
a
little
upwards
by
a
proportionate
prism
of
the
hyperchromatism
will
disappear
the
image
will
be
moved
from
its
place
and
yet
will
appear
colourless
with
an
achromatic
composed
of
three
glasses
this
experiment
may
be
made
step
by
step
if
we
do
not
mind
taking
out
the
glasses
from
their
setting
the
two
convex
glasses
of
in
contracting
the
sun
image
towards
the
focus
the
concave
glass
of
in
dilating
the
image
beyond
it
exhibit
at
the
edges
the
usual
colours
a
convex
glass
united
with
a
concave
one
exhibits
the
colours
according
to
the
law
of
the
latter
if
all
three
glasses
are
placed
together
whether
we
contract
the
sun
image
towards
the
focus
or
suffer
it
to
dilate
beyond
the
focus
coloured
edges
never
appear
and
the
achromatic
effect
intended
by
the
optician
is
in
this
case
again
attained
but
as
the
has
always
a
greenish
tint
and
as
a
tendency
to
this
hue
may
be
more
decided
in
large
and
strong
and
under
certain
circumstances
produce
the
compensatory
red
which
however
in
repeated
experiments
with
several
instruments
of
this
kind
did
not
occur
to
us
philosophers
have
resorted
to
the
most
extraordinary
modes
of
explaining
such
a
result
and
having
been
compelled
in
support
of
their
system
theoretically
to
prove
the
impossibility
of
achromatic
telescopes
have
felt
a
kind
of
satisfaction
in
having
some
apparent
ground
for
denying
so
great
an
improvement
of
this
however
we
can
only
treat
circumstantially
in
our
historical
account
of
these
discoveries
xxix
combination
of
subjective
and
objective
experiments
having
shown
above
that
refraction
considered
objectively
and
subjectively
must
act
in
opposite
directions
it
will
follow
that
if
we
combine
the
experiments
the
effects
will
reciprocally
destroy
each
other
let
the
sun
image
be
thrown
upwards
on
a
vertical
plane
through
a
prism
if
the
prism
is
long
enough
to
admit
of
the
spectator
also
looking
through
it
he
will
see
the
image
elevated
by
the
objective
refraction
again
depressed
and
in
the
same
place
in
which
it
appeared
without
refraction
here
a
remarkable
case
presents
itself
but
at
the
same
time
a
natural
result
of
a
general
law
for
since
as
often
before
stated
the
objective
sun
image
thrown
on
the
vertical
plane
is
not
an
ultimate
or
unchangeable
state
of
the
phenomenon
so
in
the
above
operation
the
image
is
not
only
depressed
when
seen
through
the
prism
but
its
edges
and
borders
are
entirely
robbed
of
their
hues
and
the
spectrum
is
reduced
to
a
colourless
circular
form
by
employing
two
perfectly
similar
prisms
placed
next
each
other
for
this
experiment
we
can
transmit
the
sun
image
through
one
and
look
through
the
other
if
the
spectator
advances
nearer
with
the
prism
through
which
he
looks
the
image
is
again
elevated
and
by
degrees
becomes
coloured
according
to
the
law
of
the
first
prism
if
he
again
retires
till
he
has
brought
the
image
to
the
neutralized
point
and
then
retires
still
farther
away
the
image
which
had
become
round
and
colourless
moves
still
more
downwards
and
becomes
coloured
in
the
opposite
sense
so
that
if
we
look
through
the
prism
and
upon
the
refracted
spectrum
at
the
same
time
we
see
the
same
image
coloured
according
to
subjective
and
objective
laws
the
modes
in
which
this
experiment
may
be
varied
are
obvious
if
the
refracting
angle
of
the
prism
through
which
the
sun
image
was
objectively
elevated
is
greater
than
that
of
the
prism
through
which
the
observer
looks
he
must
retire
to
a
much
greater
distance
in
order
to
depress
the
coloured
image
so
low
on
the
vertical
plane
that
it
shall
appear
colourless
and
it
will
be
easily
seen
that
we
may
exhibit
achromatic
and
hyperchromatic
effects
in
a
similar
manner
and
we
leave
it
to
the
amateur
to
follow
out
such
researches
more
fully
other
complicated
experiments
in
which
prisms
and
lenses
are
employed
together
others
again
in
which
objective
and
subjective
experiments
are
variously
intermixed
we
reserve
for
a
future
occasion
when
it
will
be
our
object
to
trace
such
effects
to
the
simple
phenomena
with
which
we
are
now
sufficiently
familiar
xxx
transition
in
looking
back
on
the
description
and
analysis
of
dioptrical
colours
we
do
not
repent
either
that
we
have
treated
them
so
circumstantially
or
that
we
have
taken
them
into
consideration
before
the
other
physical
colours
out
of
the
order
we
ourselves
laid
down
yet
before
we
quit
this
branch
of
our
inquiry
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
the
reasons
that
have
weighed
with
us
if
some
apology
is
necessary
for
having
treated
the
theory
of
the
dioptrical
colours
particularly
those
of
the
second
class
so
diffusely
we
should
observe
that
the
exposition
of
any
branch
of
knowledge
is
to
be
considered
partly
with
reference
to
the
intrinsic
importance
of
the
subject
and
partly
with
reference
to
the
particular
necessities
of
the
time
in
which
the
inquiry
is
undertaken
in
our
own
case
we
were
forced
to
keep
both
these
considerations
constantly
in
view
in
the
first
place
we
had
to
state
a
mass
of
experiments
with
our
consequent
convictions
next
it
was
our
especial
aim
to
exhibit
certain
phenomena
known
it
is
true
but
misunderstood
and
above
all
exhibited
in
false
connection
in
that
natural
and
progressive
development
which
is
strictly
and
truly
conformable
to
observation
in
order
that
hereafter
in
our
polemical
or
historical
investigations
we
might
be
enabled
to
bring
a
complete
preparatory
analysis
to
bear
on
and
elucidate
our
general
view
the
details
we
have
entered
into
were
on
this
account
unavoidable
they
may
be
considered
as
a
reluctant
consequence
of
the
occasion
hereafter
when
philosophers
will
look
upon
a
simple
principle
as
simple
a
combined
effect
as
combined
when
they
will
acknowledge
the
first
elementary
and
the
second
complicated
states
for
what
they
are
then
indeed
all
this
statement
may
be
abridged
to
a
narrower
form
a
labour
which
should
we
ourselves
not
be
able
to
accomplish
it
we
bequeath
to
the
active
interest
of
contemporaries
and
posterity
with
respect
to
the
order
of
the
chapters
it
should
be
remembered
that
natural
phenomena
which
are
even
allied
to
each
other
are
not
connected
in
any
particular
sequence
or
constant
series
their
efficient
causes
act
in
a
narrow
circle
so
that
it
is
in
some
sort
indifferent
what
phenomenon
is
first
or
last
considered
the
main
point
is
that
all
should
be
as
far
as
possible
present
to
us
in
order
that
we
may
embrace
them
at
last
from
one
point
of
view
partly
according
to
their
nature
partly
according
to
generally
received
methods
yet
in
the
present
particular
instance
it
may
be
asserted
that
the
dioptrical
colours
are
justly
placed
at
the
head
of
the
physical
colours
not
only
on
account
of
their
striking
splendour
and
their
importance
in
other
respects
but
because
in
tracing
these
to
their
source
much
was
necessarily
entered
into
which
will
assist
our
subsequent
enquiries
for
hitherto
light
has
been
considered
as
a
kind
of
abstract
principle
existing
and
acting
independently
to
a
certain
extent
and
on
the
slightest
cause
producing
colours
out
of
itself
to
divert
the
votaries
of
physical
science
from
this
mode
of
viewing
the
subject
to
make
them
attentive
to
the
fact
that
in
prismatic
and
other
appearances
we
have
not
to
do
with
light
as
an
uncircumscribed
and
modifying
principle
but
as
circumscribed
and
modified
that
we
have
to
do
with
a
luminous
image
with
images
or
circumscribed
objects
generally
whether
light
or
dark
this
was
the
purpose
we
had
in
view
and
such
is
the
problem
to
be
solved
all
that
takes
place
in
dioptrical
cases
especially
those
of
the
second
class
which
are
connected
with
the
phenomena
of
refraction
is
now
sufficiently
familiar
to
us
and
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
what
follows
catoptrical
appearances
remind
us
of
the
physiological
phenomena
but
as
we
ascribe
a
more
objective
character
to
the
former
we
thought
ourselves
justified
in
classing
them
with
the
physical
examples
it
is
of
importance
however
to
remember
that
here
again
it
is
not
light
in
an
abstract
sense
but
a
luminous
image
that
we
have
to
consider
in
proceeding
onwards
to
the
paroptrical
class
the
reader
if
duly
acquainted
with
the
foregoing
facts
will
be
pleased
to
find
himself
once
more
in
the
region
of
circumscribed
forms
the
shadows
of
bodies
especially
as
secondary
images
so
exactly
accompanying
the
object
will
serve
greatly
to
elucidate
analogous
appearances
we
will
not
however
anticipate
these
statements
but
proceed
as
heretofore
in
what
we
consider
the
regular
course
xxxi
catoptrical
colours
catoptrical
colours
are
such
as
appear
in
consequence
of
a
reflection
we
assume
in
the
first
place
that
the
light
itself
as
well
as
the
surface
from
which
it
is
reflected
is
perfectly
colourless
in
this
sense
the
appearances
in
question
come
under
the
head
of
physical
colours
they
arise
in
consequence
of
reflection
as
we
found
the
dioptrical
colours
of
the
second
class
appear
by
means
of
refraction
without
further
general
definitions
we
turn
our
attention
at
once
to
particular
cases
and
to
the
conditions
which
are
essential
to
the
exhibition
of
these
phenomena
if
we
unroll
a
coil
of
bright
and
after
suffering
it
to
spring
confusedly
together
again
place
it
at
a
window
in
the
light
we
shall
see
the
prominent
parts
of
the
circles
and
convolutions
illumined
but
neither
resplendent
nor
iridescent
but
if
the
sun
shines
on
the
wire
this
light
will
be
condensed
into
a
point
and
we
perceive
a
small
resplendent
image
of
the
sun
which
when
seen
near
exhibits
no
colour
on
retiring
a
little
however
and
fixing
the
eyes
on
this
refulgent
appearance
we
discern
several
small
mirrored
suns
coloured
in
the
most
varied
manner
and
although
the
impression
is
that
green
and
red
predominate
yet
on
a
more
accurate
inspection
we
find
that
the
other
colours
are
also
present
if
we
take
an
and
examine
the
appearance
through
it
we
find
the
colours
have
vanished
as
well
as
the
radiating
splendour
in
which
they
were
seen
and
we
perceive
only
the
small
luminous
points
the
repeated
images
of
the
sun
we
thus
find
that
the
impression
is
subjective
in
its
nature
and
that
the
appearance
is
allied
to
those
which
we
have
adverted
to
under
the
name
of
radiating
halos
we
can
however
exhibit
this
phenomenon
objectively
let
a
piece
of
white
paper
be
fastened
beneath
a
small
aperture
in
the
lid
of
a
and
when
the
sun
shines
through
this
aperture
let
the
be
held
in
the
light
so
that
it
be
opposite
to
the
paper
the
will
impinge
on
and
in
the
circles
of
the
wire
and
will
not
as
in
the
concentrating
lens
of
the
eye
display
itself
in
a
point
but
as
the
paper
can
receive
the
reflection
of
the
light
in
every
part
of
its
surface
will
be
seen
in
lines
which
are
also
iridescent
this
experiment
is
purely
catoptrical
for
as
we
can
not
imagine
that
the
light
penetrates
the
surface
of
the
steel
and
thus
undergoes
a
change
we
are
soon
convinced
that
we
have
here
a
mere
reflection
which
in
its
subjective
character
is
connected
with
the
theory
of
faintly
acting
lights
and
the
of
dazzling
lights
and
as
far
as
it
can
be
considered
objective
announces
even
in
the
minutest
appearances
a
real
effect
independent
of
the
action
and
reaction
of
the
eye
we
have
seen
that
to
produce
these
effects
not
merely
light
but
a
powerful
light
is
necessary
that
this
powerful
light
again
is
not
an
abstract
and
general
quality
but
a
circumscribed
light
a
luminous
image
we
can
convince
ourselves
still
further
of
this
by
analogous
cases
a
polished
surface
of
silver
placed
in
the
sun
reflects
a
dazzling
light
but
in
this
case
no
colour
is
seen
if
however
we
slightly
scratch
the
surface
an
iridescent
appearance
in
which
green
and
red
are
conspicuous
will
be
exhibited
at
a
certain
angle
in
chased
and
carved
metals
the
effect
is
striking
yet
it
may
be
remarked
throughout
that
in
order
to
its
appearance
some
form
some
alternation
of
light
and
dark
must
with
the
reflection
thus
a
the
stem
of
a
tree
an
accidentally
or
purposely
interposed
object
produces
a
perceptible
effect
this
appearance
too
may
be
exhibited
objectively
in
the
if
we
cause
a
polished
plated
surface
to
be
so
acted
on
by
aqua
fortis
that
the
copper
within
is
touched
and
the
surface
itself
thus
rendered
rough
and
if
the
sun
image
be
then
reflected
from
it
the
splendour
will
be
reverberated
from
every
minutest
prominence
and
the
surface
will
appear
iridescent
so
if
we
hold
a
sheet
of
black
unglazed
paper
in
the
sun
and
look
at
it
attentively
it
will
be
seen
to
glisten
in
its
minutest
points
with
the
most
vivid
colours
all
these
examples
are
referable
to
the
same
conditions
in
the
first
case
the
luminous
image
is
reflected
from
a
thin
line
in
the
second
probably
from
sharp
edges
in
the
third
from
very
small
points
in
all
a
very
powerful
and
circumscribed
light
is
requisite
for
all
these
appearances
of
colour
again
it
is
necessary
that
the
eye
should
be
at
a
due
distance
from
the
reflecting
points
if
these
observations
are
made
with
the
microscope
the
appearance
will
be
greatly
increased
in
force
and
splendour
for
we
then
see
the
smallest
portion
of
the
surfaces
lit
by
the
sun
glittering
in
these
colours
of
reflection
which
allied
to
the
hues
of
refraction
now
attain
their
highest
degree
of
brilliancy
in
such
cases
we
may
observe
a
vermiform
iridescence
on
the
surface
of
organic
bodies
the
further
description
of
which
will
be
given
hereafter
lastly
the
colours
which
are
chiefly
exhibited
in
reflection
are
red
and
green
whence
we
may
infer
that
the
linear
appearance
especially
consists
of
a
thin
line
of
red
bounded
by
blue
on
one
side
and
yellow
on
the
other
if
these
triple
lines
approach
very
near
together
the
intermediate
space
must
appear
green
a
phenomenon
which
will
often
occur
to
us
as
we
proceed
we
frequently
meet
with
these
colours
in
nature
the
colours
of
the
spider
web
might
be
considered
exactly
of
the
same
class
with
those
reflected
from
the
steel
wire
except
that
the
quality
of
the
former
is
not
so
certain
as
in
the
case
of
steel
on
which
account
some
have
been
inclined
to
class
the
colours
of
the
web
with
the
phenomena
of
refraction
in
we
perceive
infinitely
fine
organic
fibres
and
lamellæ
in
from
which
as
from
the
scratched
silver
before
alluded
to
varied
colours
but
especially
red
and
green
may
arise
the
changing
colours
of
the
plumage
of
birds
may
also
be
mentioned
here
although
in
all
organic
instances
a
chemical
principle
and
an
adaptation
of
the
colour
to
the
structure
may
be
assumed
considerations
to
which
we
shall
return
in
treating
of
chemical
colours
that
the
appearances
of
objective
halos
also
approximate
catoptrical
phenomena
will
be
readily
admitted
while
we
again
do
not
deny
that
refraction
as
well
may
here
come
into
the
account
for
the
present
we
restrict
ourselves
to
one
or
two
observations
hereafter
we
may
be
enabled
to
make
a
fuller
application
of
general
principles
to
particular
examples
we
first
call
to
mind
the
yellow
and
red
circles
produced
on
a
white
or
grey
wall
by
a
light
placed
near
it
light
when
reflected
appears
subdued
and
a
subdued
light
excites
the
impression
of
yellow
and
subsequently
of
red
let
the
wall
be
illumined
by
a
candle
placed
quite
close
to
it
the
farther
the
light
is
diffused
the
fainter
it
becomes
but
it
is
still
the
effect
of
the
flame
the
continuation
of
its
action
the
dilated
effect
of
its
image
we
might
therefore
very
fairly
call
these
circles
reiterated
images
because
they
constitute
the
successive
boundaries
of
the
action
of
the
light
and
yet
at
the
same
time
only
present
an
extended
image
of
the
flame
if
the
sky
is
white
and
luminous
round
the
sun
owing
to
the
atmosphere
being
filled
with
light
vapours
if
mists
or
clouds
pass
before
the
moon
the
reflection
of
the
disk
mirrors
itself
in
them
the
halos
we
then
perceive
are
single
or
double
smaller
or
greater
sometimes
very
large
often
colourless
sometimes
coloured
i
witnessed
a
very
beautiful
halo
round
the
moon
the
of
november
when
the
barometer
stood
high
the
sky
was
cloudy
and
vapoury
the
halo
was
completely
coloured
and
the
circles
were
concentric
round
the
light
as
in
subjective
halos
that
this
halo
was
objective
i
was
presently
convinced
by
covering
the
moon
disk
when
the
same
circles
were
nevertheless
perfectly
visible
the
different
extent
of
the
halos
appears
to
have
a
relation
with
the
proximity
or
distance
of
the
vapour
from
the
eye
of
the
observer
as
lightly
breathed
upon
increase
the
brilliancy
of
subjective
halos
and
in
some
degree
give
them
an
objective
character
so
perhaps
with
a
simple
contrivance
in
winter
during
a
quickly
freezing
temperature
a
more
exact
definition
of
this
might
be
arrived
at
how
much
reason
we
have
in
considering
these
circles
to
insist
on
the
and
its
effects
is
apparent
in
the
phenomenon
of
the
double
suns
similar
double
images
always
occur
in
certain
points
of
halos
and
circles
and
only
present
in
a
circumscribed
form
what
takes
place
in
a
more
general
way
in
the
whole
circle
all
this
will
be
more
conveniently
treated
in
connexion
with
the
appearance
of
the
note
q
in
conclusion
it
is
only
necessary
to
point
out
the
affinity
between
the
catoptrical
and
paroptical
colours
we
call
those
paroptical
colours
which
appear
when
the
light
passes
by
the
edge
of
an
opaque
colourless
body
how
nearly
these
are
allied
to
the
dioptrical
colours
of
the
second
class
will
be
easily
seen
by
those
who
are
convinced
with
us
that
the
colours
of
refraction
pg
take
place
only
at
the
edges
of
objects
the
affinity
again
between
the
catoptrical
and
paroptical
colours
will
be
evident
in
the
following
chapter
xxxii
paroptical
colours
the
paroptical
colours
have
been
hitherto
called
because
a
peculiar
effect
of
light
was
supposed
to
take
place
as
it
were
round
the
object
and
was
ascribed
to
a
certain
flexibility
of
the
light
to
and
from
the
object
these
colours
again
may
be
divided
into
subjective
and
objective
because
they
appear
partly
without
us
as
it
were
painted
on
surfaces
and
partly
within
us
immediately
on
the
retina
in
this
chapter
we
shall
find
it
more
to
our
purpose
to
take
the
objective
cases
first
since
the
subjective
are
so
closely
connected
with
other
appearances
already
known
to
us
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
separate
them
the
paroptical
colours
then
are
so
called
because
the
light
must
pass
by
an
outline
or
edge
to
produce
them
they
do
not
however
always
appear
in
this
case
to
produce
the
effect
very
particular
conditions
are
necessary
besides
it
is
also
to
be
observed
that
in
this
instance
again
light
does
not
act
as
an
abstract
diffusion
the
sun
shines
towards
an
edge
the
volume
of
light
poured
from
the
passes
by
the
edge
of
a
substance
and
occasions
shadows
within
these
shadows
we
shall
presently
find
colours
appear
but
above
all
we
should
make
the
experiments
and
observations
that
bear
upon
our
present
inquiry
in
the
fullest
light
we
therefore
place
the
observer
in
the
open
air
before
we
conduct
him
to
the
limits
of
a
dark
room
a
person
walking
in
in
a
garden
or
on
any
level
path
may
observe
that
his
shadow
only
appears
sharply
defined
next
the
foot
on
which
he
rests
farther
from
this
point
especially
round
the
head
it
melts
away
into
the
bright
ground
for
as
the
proceeds
not
only
from
the
middle
of
the
sun
but
also
acts
from
the
two
extremes
of
every
diameter
an
objective
parallax
takes
place
which
produces
a
on
both
sides
of
the
object
if
the
person
walking
raises
and
spreads
his
hand
he
distinctly
sees
in
the
shadow
of
each
finger
the
diverging
separation
of
the
two
outwards
and
the
diminution
of
the
principal
shadow
inwards
both
being
effects
of
the
cross
action
of
the
light
this
experiment
may
be
repeated
and
varied
before
a
smooth
wall
with
rods
of
different
thicknesses
and
again
with
balls
we
shall
always
find
that
the
farther
the
object
is
removed
from
the
surface
of
the
wall
the
more
the
weak
double
shadow
spreads
and
the
more
the
forcible
main
shadow
diminishes
till
at
last
the
main
shadow
appears
quite
effaced
and
even
the
double
shadows
become
so
faint
that
they
almost
disappear
at
a
still
greater
distance
they
are
in
fact
imperceptible
that
this
is
caused
by
the
of
the
light
we
may
easily
convince
ourselves
for
the
shadow
of
a
pointed
object
plainly
exhibits
two
points
we
must
thus
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
in
this
case
the
whole
acts
produces
shadows
changes
them
to
double
shadows
and
finally
obliterates
them
instead
of
solid
bodies
let
us
now
take
openings
cut
of
various
given
sizes
next
each
other
and
let
the
sun
shine
through
them
on
a
plane
surface
at
some
little
distance
we
shall
find
that
the
bright
image
produced
by
the
sun
on
the
surface
is
larger
than
the
opening
this
is
because
one
edge
of
the
sun
shines
towards
the
opposite
edge
of
the
opening
while
the
other
edge
of
the
disk
is
excluded
on
that
side
hence
the
bright
image
is
more
weakly
lighted
towards
the
edges
if
we
take
square
openings
of
any
size
we
please
we
shall
find
that
the
bright
image
on
a
surface
nine
feet
from
the
opening
is
on
every
side
about
an
inch
larger
than
the
opening
thus
nearly
corresponding
with
the
angle
of
the
apparent
diameter
of
the
sun
that
the
brightness
should
gradually
diminish
towards
the
edges
of
the
image
is
quite
natural
for
at
last
only
a
minimum
of
the
light
can
act
from
the
sun
circumference
through
the
edge
of
the
aperture
thus
we
here
again
see
how
much
reason
we
have
in
actual
observation
to
guard
against
the
assumption
of
parallel
rays
bundles
and
fasces
of
rays
and
the
like
hypothetical
notions
we
might
rather
consider
the
splendour
of
the
sun
or
of
any
light
as
an
infinite
specular
multiplication
of
the
circumscribed
luminous
image
whence
it
may
be
explained
that
all
square
openings
through
which
the
sun
shines
at
certain
distances
according
as
the
apertures
are
greater
or
smaller
must
give
a
round
image
of
light
the
above
experiments
may
be
repeated
through
openings
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
and
the
same
effect
will
always
take
place
at
proportionate
distances
in
all
these
cases
however
we
may
still
observe
that
in
a
full
light
and
while
the
sun
merely
shines
past
an
edge
no
colour
is
apparent
we
therefore
proceed
to
experiments
with
a
subdued
light
which
is
essential
to
the
appearance
of
colour
let
a
small
opening
be
made
in
the
of
a
dark
room
let
the
crossing
which
enters
be
received
on
a
surface
of
white
paper
and
we
shall
find
that
the
smaller
the
opening
is
the
dimmer
the
light
image
will
be
this
is
quite
obvious
because
the
paper
does
not
receive
light
from
the
whole
sun
but
partially
from
single
points
of
its
disk
if
we
look
attentively
at
this
dim
image
of
the
sun
we
find
it
still
dimmer
towards
the
outlines
where
a
yellow
border
is
perceptible
the
colour
is
still
more
apparent
if
a
vapour
or
a
transparent
cloud
passes
before
the
sun
thus
subduing
and
dimming
its
brightness
the
halo
on
the
wall
the
effect
of
the
decreasing
brightness
of
a
light
placed
near
it
is
here
forced
on
our
recollection
if
we
examine
the
image
more
accurately
we
perceive
that
this
yellow
border
is
not
the
only
appearance
of
colour
we
can
see
besides
a
bluish
circle
if
not
even
a
repetition
of
the
coloured
border
if
the
room
is
quite
dark
we
discern
that
the
sky
next
the
sun
also
has
its
effect
we
see
the
blue
sky
nay
even
the
whole
landscape
on
the
paper
and
are
thus
again
convinced
that
as
far
as
regards
the
sun
we
have
here
only
to
do
with
a
luminous
image
if
we
take
a
somewhat
larger
square
opening
so
large
that
the
image
of
the
sun
shining
through
it
does
not
immediately
become
round
we
may
distinctly
observe
the
of
every
edge
or
side
the
junction
of
these
in
the
corners
and
their
colours
just
as
in
the
appearance
with
the
round
opening
we
have
now
subdued
a
parallactic
light
by
causing
it
to
shine
through
small
apertures
but
we
have
not
taken
from
it
its
parallactic
character
so
that
it
can
produce
double
shadows
of
bodies
although
with
diminished
power
these
double
shadows
which
we
have
hitherto
been
describing
follow
each
other
in
light
and
dark
coloured
and
colourless
circles
and
produce
repeated
nay
almost
innumerable
halos
these
effects
have
been
often
represented
in
drawings
and
engravings
by
placing
needles
hairs
and
other
small
bodies
in
the
subdued
light
the
numerous
double
shadows
may
be
increased
thus
observed
they
have
been
ascribed
to
an
alternating
flexile
action
of
the
light
and
the
same
assumption
has
been
employed
to
explain
the
obliteration
of
the
central
shadow
and
the
appearance
of
a
light
in
the
place
of
the
dark
for
ourselves
we
maintain
that
these
again
are
parallactic
double
shadows
which
appear
edged
with
coloured
borders
and
halos
after
having
seen
and
investigated
the
foregoing
phenomena
we
can
proceed
to
the
experiments
with
exhibiting
effects
which
may
be
referred
to
the
contact
and
parallactic
mutual
intersection
of
the
and
halos
already
familiar
to
us
lastly
the
observer
may
follow
out
the
experiments
with
hairs
needles
and
wires
in
the
produced
as
before
described
by
the
sun
as
well
as
in
that
derived
from
the
blue
sky
and
indicated
on
the
white
paper
he
will
thus
make
himself
still
better
acquainted
with
the
true
nature
of
this
phenomenon
but
since
in
these
experiments
everything
depends
on
our
being
persuaded
of
the
parallactic
action
of
the
light
we
can
make
this
more
evident
by
means
of
two
sources
of
light
the
two
shadows
from
which
intersect
each
other
and
may
be
altogether
separated
by
day
this
may
be
contrived
with
two
small
openings
in
a
by
night
with
two
candles
there
are
even
accidental
effects
in
interiors
on
opening
and
closing
shutters
by
means
of
which
we
can
better
observe
these
appearances
than
with
the
most
careful
apparatus
but
still
all
and
each
of
these
may
be
reduced
to
experiment
by
preparing
a
box
which
the
observer
can
look
into
from
above
and
gradually
diminishing
the
openings
after
having
caused
a
double
light
to
shine
in
in
this
case
as
might
be
expected
the
coloured
shadow
considered
under
the
physiological
colours
appears
very
easily
it
is
necessary
to
remember
generally
what
has
been
before
stated
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
double
shadows
and
the
like
experiments
also
should
especially
be
made
with
different
shades
of
grey
placed
next
each
other
where
every
stripe
will
appear
light
by
a
darker
and
dark
by
a
lighter
stripe
next
it
if
at
night
with
three
or
more
lights
we
produce
shadows
which
cross
each
other
successively
we
can
observe
this
phenomenon
very
distinctly
and
we
shall
be
convinced
that
the
physiological
case
before
more
fully
treated
here
comes
into
the
account
to
what
extent
the
appearances
that
accompany
the
paroptical
colours
may
be
derived
from
the
doctrine
of
subdued
lights
from
and
from
the
physiological
disposition
of
the
retina
or
whether
we
shall
be
forced
to
take
refuge
in
certain
intrinsic
qualities
of
light
as
has
hitherto
been
done
time
may
teach
suffice
it
here
to
have
pointed
out
the
conditions
under
which
the
paroptical
colours
appear
and
we
may
hope
that
our
allusion
to
their
connexion
with
the
facts
before
adduced
by
us
will
not
remain
unnoticed
by
the
observers
of
nature
the
affinity
of
the
paroptical
colours
with
the
dioptrical
of
the
second
class
will
also
be
readily
seen
and
followed
up
by
every
reflecting
investigator
here
as
in
those
instances
we
have
to
do
with
edges
or
boundaries
here
as
in
those
instances
with
a
light
which
appears
at
the
outline
how
natural
therefore
it
is
to
conclude
that
the
paroptical
effects
may
be
heightened
strengthened
and
enriched
by
the
dioptrical
since
however
the
luminous
image
actually
shines
through
the
medium
we
can
here
only
have
to
do
with
objective
cases
of
refraction
it
is
these
which
are
strictly
allied
to
the
paroptical
cases
the
subjective
cases
of
refraction
where
we
see
objects
through
the
medium
are
quite
distinct
from
the
paroptical
we
have
already
recommended
them
on
account
of
their
clearness
and
simplicity
the
connexion
between
the
paroptical
colours
and
the
catoptrical
may
be
already
inferred
from
what
has
been
said
for
as
the
catoptrical
colours
only
appear
on
scratches
points
and
delicate
threads
so
it
is
nearly
the
same
case
as
if
the
light
shone
past
an
edge
the
light
must
always
be
reflected
from
an
edge
in
order
to
produce
colour
here
again
as
before
pointed
out
the
partial
action
of
the
luminous
image
and
the
subduing
of
the
light
are
both
to
be
taken
into
the
account
we
add
but
few
observations
on
the
subjective
paroptical
colours
because
these
may
be
classed
partly
with
the
physiological
colours
partly
with
the
dioptrical
of
the
second
order
the
greater
part
hardly
seem
to
belong
here
but
when
attentively
considered
they
still
diffuse
a
satisfactory
light
over
the
whole
doctrine
and
establish
its
connexion
if
we
hold
a
ruler
before
the
eyes
so
that
the
flame
of
a
light
just
appears
above
it
we
see
the
ruler
as
it
were
indented
and
notched
at
the
place
where
the
light
appears
this
seems
deducible
from
the
expansive
power
of
light
acting
on
the
retina
the
same
phenomenon
on
a
large
scale
is
exhibited
at
for
when
the
orb
appears
distinctly
but
not
too
powerfully
so
that
we
can
still
look
at
it
it
always
makes
a
sharp
indentation
in
the
horizon
if
when
the
sky
is
grey
we
approach
a
window
so
that
the
dark
cross
of
the
be
relieved
on
the
sky
if
after
fixing
the
eyes
on
the
horizontal
bar
we
bend
the
head
a
little
forward
on
half
closing
the
eyes
as
we
look
up
we
shall
presently
perceive
a
bright
border
under
the
bar
and
a
bright
one
above
it
the
duller
and
more
monotonous
the
grey
of
the
sky
the
more
dusky
the
room
and
consequently
the
more
previously
unexcited
the
eye
the
livelier
the
appearance
will
be
but
it
may
be
seen
by
an
attentive
observer
even
in
bright
daylight
if
we
move
the
head
backwards
while
half
closing
the
eyes
so
that
the
horizontal
bar
be
seen
below
the
phenomenon
will
appear
reversed
the
upper
edge
will
appear
yellow
the
under
edge
blue
such
observations
are
best
made
in
a
dark
room
if
white
paper
is
spread
before
the
opening
where
the
solar
microscope
is
commonly
fastened
the
lower
edge
of
the
circle
will
appear
blue
the
upper
yellow
even
while
the
eyes
are
quite
open
or
only
by
them
so
far
that
a
halo
no
longer
appears
round
the
white
if
the
head
is
moved
backwards
the
colours
are
reversed
these
phenomena
seem
to
prove
that
the
humours
of
the
eye
are
in
fact
only
really
achromatic
in
the
centre
where
vision
takes
place
but
that
towards
the
circumference
and
in
unusual
motions
of
the
eyes
as
in
looking
horizontally
when
the
head
is
bent
backwards
or
forwards
a
chromatic
tendency
remains
especially
when
distinctly
relieved
objects
are
thus
looked
at
hence
such
phenomena
may
be
considered
as
allied
to
the
dioptrical
colours
of
the
second
class
similar
colours
appear
if
we
look
on
black
and
white
objects
through
a
in
a
card
instead
of
a
white
object
we
may
take
the
minute
light
aperture
in
the
tin
plate
of
a
camera
obscura
as
prepared
for
paroptical
experiments
if
we
look
through
a
tube
the
farther
end
of
which
is
contracted
or
variously
indented
the
same
colours
appear
the
following
phenomena
appear
to
me
to
be
more
nearly
allied
to
the
paroptical
appearances
if
we
hold
up
a
needle
near
the
eye
the
point
appears
double
a
particularly
remarkable
effect
again
is
produced
if
we
look
towards
a
grey
sky
through
the
blades
of
knives
prepared
for
paroptical
experiments
we
seem
to
look
through
a
gauze
a
multitude
of
threads
appear
to
the
eye
these
are
in
fact
only
the
reiterated
images
of
the
sharp
edges
each
of
which
is
successively
modified
by
the
next
or
perhaps
modified
in
a
parallactic
sense
by
the
oppositely
acting
one
the
whole
mass
being
thus
changed
to
a
appearance
lastly
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
if
we
look
through
the
blades
towards
a
minute
light
in
the
coloured
stripes
and
halos
appear
on
the
retina
as
on
the
paper
the
present
chapter
may
be
here
terminated
the
less
reluctantly
as
a
friend
has
undertaken
to
investigate
this
subject
by
further
experiments

our
recapitulation

it

still

under

the
phenomenon
exhibits
itself
immediately
on
the
slightest
pressure
and
may
then
be
gradually
carried
through
various
successive
states
we
will
describe
the
complete
appearance
at
once
as
we
shall
then
be
better
enabled
to
follow
the
different
states
through
which
it
passes
the

is

where
the
glasses
are
so
to
speak
united
in
one
by
the
strongest
pressure
a
dark
grey
point
appears
with
a
silver
white
space
round
it
then
follow
in
decreasing
distances
various
insulated
rings
all
consisting
of
three
colours
which
are
in
immediate
contact
with
each
other
each
of
these
rings
of
which
perhaps
three
or
four
might
be
counted
is
yellow
on
the
inner
side
blue
on
the
outer
and
red
in
the
centre
between
two
rings
there
appears
a
silver
white
interval
the
rings
which
are
farthest
from
the
centre
are
always
nearer
together
they
are
composed
of
red
and
green
without
a
perceptible
white
space
between
them
we
will
now
observe
the
appearances
in
their
gradual
formation
beginning
from
the
slightest
pressure
on
the
slightest
pressure
the
centre
itself
appears
of
a
green
colour
then
follow
as
far
as
the
concentric
circles
extend
red
and
green
rings
they
are
wide
accordingly
and
no
trace
of
a
silver
white
space
is
to
be
seen
between
them
the
green
is
produced
by
the
blue
of
an
imperfectly
developed
circle
mixing
with
the
yellow
of
the
first
circle
all
the
remaining
circles
are
in
this
slight
contact
broad
their
yellow
and
blue
edges
mix
together
thus
producing
a
beautiful
green
the
red
however
of
each
circle
remains
pure
and
untouched
hence
the
whole
series
is
composed
of
these
two
colours
a
somewhat
stronger
pressure
separates
the
first
circle
by
a
slight
interval
from
the
imperfectly
developed
one
it
is
thus
detached
and
may
be
said
to
appear
in
a
complete
state
the
centre
is
now
a
blue
point
for
the
yellow
of
the
first
circle
is
now
separated
from
this
central
point
by
a
silver
white
space
from
the
centre
of
the
blue
a
red
appears
which
is
thus
in
all
cases
bounded
on
the
outside
by
its
blue
edge
the
second
and
third
rings
from
the
centre
are
quite
detached
where
deviations
from
this
order
present
themselves
the
observer
will
be
enabled
to
account
for
them
from
what
has
been
or
remains
to
be
stated
on
a
stronger
pressure
the
centre
becomes
yellow
this
yellow
is
surrounded
by
a
red
and
blue
edge
at
last
the
yellow
also
retires
from
the
centre
the
innermost
circle
is
formed
and
is
bounded
with
yellow
the
whole
centre
itself
now
appears
silver
white
till
at
last
on
the
strongest
pressure
the
dark
point
appears
and
the
phenomenon
as
described
at
first
is
complete
the
relative
size
of
the
concentric
circles
and
their
intervals
depends
on
the
form
of
the
glasses
which
are
pressed
together
we
remarked
above
that
the
coloured
centre
is
in
fact
an
undeveloped
circle
it
is
however
often
found
on
the
slightest
pressure
that
several
undeveloped
circles
exist
there
as
it
were
in
the
germ
these
can
be
successively
developed
before
the
eye
of
the
observer
the
regularity
of
these
rings
is
owing
to
the
form
of
the
convex
glasses
and
the
diameter
of
the
coloured
appearance
depends
on
the
greater
or
lesser
section
of
a
circle
on
which
a
lens
is
polished
we
easily
conclude
from
this
that
by
pressing
plane
glasses
together
irregular
appearances
only
will
be
produced
the
colours
in
fact
undulate
like
watered
silks
and
spread
from
the
point
of
pressure
in
all
directions
yet
the
phenomenon
as
thus
exhibited
is
much
more
splendid
than
in
the
former
instance
and
can
not
fail
to
strike
every
spectator
if
we
make
the
experiment
in
this
mode
we
shall
distinctly
see
as
in
the
other
case
that
on
a
slight
pressure
the
green
and
red
waves
appear
on
a
stronger
stripes
of
blue
red
and
yellow
become
detached
at
first
the
outer
sides
of
these
stripes
touch
on
increased
pressure
they
are
separated
by
a
silver
white
space
before
we
proceed
to
a
further
description
of
this
phenomenon
we
may
point
out
the
most
convenient
mode
of
exhibiting
it
place
a
large
convex
glass
on
a
table
near
the
window
upon
this
glass
lay
a
plate
of
about
the
size
of
a
and
the
mere
weight
of
the
plate
will
press
sufficiently
to
produce
one
or
other
of
the
phenomena
above
described
so
also
by
the
different
weight
of
plates
of
glass
by
other
accidental
circumstances
for
instance
by
slipping
the
plate
on
the
side
of
the
convex
glass
where
the
pressure
can
not
be
so
strong
as
in
the
centre
all
the
gradations
above
described
can
be
produced
in
succession
in
order
to
observe
the
phenomenon
it
is
necessary
to
look
obliquely
on
the
surface
where
it
appears
but
above
all
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
by
stooping
still
more
and
looking
at
the
appearance
under
a
more
acute
angle
the
circles
not
only
grow
larger
but
other
circles
are
developed
from
the
centre
of
which
no
trace
is
to
be
discovered
when
we
look
perpendicularly
even
through
the
strongest
magnifiers
in
order
to
exhibit
the
phenomenon
in
its
greatest
beauty
the
utmost
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
cleanness
of
the
glasses
if
the
experiment
is
made
with
adapted
for
mirrors
the
glass
should
be
handled
with
gloves
the
inner
surfaces
which
must
come
in
contact
with
the
utmost
nicety
may
be
most
conveniently
cleaned
before
the
experiment
and
the
outer
surfaces
should
be
kept
clean
while
the
pressure
is
increased
from
what
has
been
said
it
will
be
seen
that
an
exact
contact
of
two
smooth
surfaces
is
necessary
polished
glasses
are
best
adapted
for
the
purpose
plates
of
glass
exhibit
the
most
brilliant
colours
when
they
fit
closely
together
and
for
this
reason
the
phenomenon
will
increase
in
beauty
if
exhibited
under
an
by
exhausting
the
air
the
appearance
of
the
coloured
rings
may
be
produced
in
the
greatest
perfection
by
placing
a
convex
and
concave
glass
together
which
have
been
ground
on
similar
segments
of
circles
i
have
never
seen
the
effect
more
brilliant
than
with
the
of
an
achromatic
telescope
in
which
the
and
were
necessarily
in
the
closest
contact
a
remarkable
appearance
takes
place
when
dissimilar
surfaces
are
pressed
together
for
example
a
polished
crystal
and
a
plate
of
glass
the
appearance
does
not
at
all
exhibit
itself
in
large
flowing
waves
as
in
the
combination
of
glass
with
glass
but
it
is
small
and
angular
and
as
it
were
disjointed
thus
it
appears
that
the
surface
of
the
polished
crystal
which
consists
of
infinitely
small
sections
of
lamellæ
does
not
come
so
uninterruptedly
in
contact
with
the
glass
as
another
would
the
appearance
of
colour
vanishes
on
the
strongest
pressure
which
so
intimately
unites
the
two
surfaces
that
they
appear
to
make
but
one
substance
it
is
this
which
occasions
the
dark
centre
because
the
pressed
lens
no
longer
reflects
any
light
from
this
point
for
the
very
same
point
when
seen
against
the
light
is
perfectly
clear
and
transparent
on
relaxing
the
pressure
the
colours
in
like
manner
gradually
diminish
and
disappear
entirely
when
the
surfaces
are
separated
these
same
appearances
occur
in
two
similar
cases
if
entirely
transparent
masses
become
partially
separated
the
surfaces
of
their
parts
being
still
sufficiently
in
contact
we
see
the
same
circles
and
waves
more
or
less
they
may
be
produced
in
great
beauty
by
plunging
a
hot
mass
of
glass
in
water
the
different
fissures
and
cracks
enabling
us
to
observe
the
colours
in
various
forms
nature
often
exhibits
the
same
phenomena
in
split
rock
crystals
this
appearance
again
frequently
displays
itself
in
the
mineral
world
in
those
kinds
of
stone
which
by
nature
have
a
tendency
to
exfoliate
these
original
lamellæ
are
it
is
true
so
intimately
united
that
stones
of
this
kind
appear
altogether
transparent
and
colourless
yet
the
internal
layers
become
separated
from
various
accidental
causes
without
altogether
destroying
the
contact
thus
the
appearance
which
is
now
familiar
to
us
by
the
foregoing
description
often
occurs
in
nature
particularly
in
calcareous
spars
the
specularis
adularia
and
other
minerals
of
similar
structure
hence
it
shows
an
ignorance
of
the
proximate
causes
of
an
appearance
so
often
accidentally
produced
to
consider
it
so
important
in
mineralogy
and
to
attach
especial
value
to
the
specimens
exhibiting
it
we
have
yet
to
speak
of
the
very
remarkable
inversion
of
this
appearance
as
related
by
men
of
science
if
namely
instead
of
looking
at
the
colours
by
a
reflected
light
we
examine
them
by
a
transmitted
light
the
opposite
colours
are
said
to
appear
and
in
a
mode
corresponding
with
that
which
we
have
before
described
as
physiological
the
colours
evoking
each
other
instead
of
blue
we
should
thus
see
instead
of
red
green
and
we
reserve
experiments
in
detail
the
rather
as
we
have
ourselves
still
some
doubts
on
this
point
if
we
were
now
called
upon
to
give
some
general
explanation
of
these
epoptical
colours
as
they
appear
under
the
first
condition
and
to
show
their
connexion
with
the
previously
detailed
physical
phenomena
we
might
proceed
to
do
so
as
follows
the
glasses
employed
for
the
experiments
are
to
be
regarded
as
the
utmost
possible
practical
approach
to
transparence
by
the
intimate
contact
however
occasioned
by
the
pressure
applied
to
them
their
surfaces
we
are
persuaded
immediately
become
in
a
very
slight
degree
dimmed
within
this
the
colours
immediately
appear
and
every
circle
comprehends
the
whole
scale
for
when
the
two
opposites
yellow
and
blue
are
united
by
their
red
extremities
pure
red
appears
the
green
on
the
other
hand
as
in
prismatic
experiments
when
yellow
and
blue
touch
we
have
already
repeatedly
found
that
where
colour
exists
at
all
the
whole
scale
is
soon
called
into
existence
a
similar
principle
may
be
said
to
lurk
in
the
nature
of
every
physical
phenomenon
it
already
follows
from
the
idea
of
polar
opposition
from
which
an
elementary
unity
or
completeness
results
the
fact
that
a
colour
exhibited
by
transmitted
light
is
different
from
that
displayed
by
reflected
light
reminds
us
of
those
dioptrical
colours
of
the
first
class
which
we
found
were
produced
precisely
in
the
same
way
through
that
here
too
a
diminution
of
transparency
exists
there
can
scarcely
be
a
doubt
for
the
adhesion
of
the
perfectly
smooth
plates
of
glass
an
adhesion
so
strong
that
they
remain
hanging
to
each
other
produces
a
degree
of
union
which
deprives
each
of
the
two
surfaces
in
some
degree
of
its
smoothness
and
transparence
the
fullest
proof
may
however
be
found
in
the
fact
that
in
the
centre
where
the
lens
is
most
strongly
pressed
on
the
other
glass
and
where
a
perfect
union
is
accomplished
a
complete
transparence
takes
place
in
which
we
no
longer
perceive
any
colour
all
this
may
be
hereafter
confirmed
in
a
recapitulation
of
the
whole
second
if
after
breathing
on
a
plate
of
glass
the
breath
is
merely
wiped
away
with
the
finger
and
if
we
then
again
immediately
breathe
on
the
glass
we
see
very
vivid
colours
gliding
through
each
other
these
as
the
moisture
evaporates
change
their
place
and
at
last
vanish
altogether
if
this
operation
is
repeated
the
colours
are
more
vivid
and
beautiful
and
remain
longer
than
they
did
the
first
time
quickly
as
this
appearance
passes
and
confused
as
it
appears
to
be
i
have
yet
remarked
the
following
effects
at
first
all
the
principal
colours
appear
with
their
combinations
on
breathing
more
strongly
the
appearance
may
be
perceived
in
some
order
in
this
succession
it
may
be
remarked
that
when
the
breath
in
evaporating
becomes
contracted
from
all
sides
towards
the
centre
the
blue
colour
vanishes
last
the
phenomenon
appears
most
readily
between
the
minute
lines
which
the
action
of
passing
the
fingers
leaves
on
the
clear
surface
a
somewhat
rough
state
of
the
surface
of
the
glass
is
otherwise
requisite
on
some
glass
the
appearance
may
be
produced
by
merely
breathing
in
other
cases
the
wiping
with
the
fingers
is
necessary
i
have
even
met
with
polished
one
side
of
which
immediately
showed
the
colours
vividly
the
other
not
to
judge
from
some
remaining
pieces
the
former
was
originally
the
front
of
the
glass
the
latter
the
side
which
was
covered
with
quicksilver
these
experiments
may
be
best
made
in
cold
weather
because
the
glass
may
be
more
quickly
and
distinctly
breathed
upon
and
the
breath
evaporates
more
suddenly
in
severe
frost
the
phenomenon
may
be
observed
on
a
large
scale
while
travelling
in
a
carriage
the
glasses
being
well
cleaned
and
all
closed
the
breath
of
the
persons
within
is
very
gently
diffused
over
the
glass
and
immediately
produces
the
most
vivid
play
of
colours
how
far
they
may
present
a
regular
succession
i
have
not
been
able
to
remark
but
they
appear
particularly
vivid
when
they
have
a
dark
object
as
a
background
this
alternation
of
colours
does
not
however
last
long
for
as
soon
as
the
breath
gathers
in
drops
or
freezes
to
points
of
ice
the
appearance
is
at
once
at
an
end
third
the
two
foregoing
experiments
of
the
pressure
and
breathing
may
be
united
namely
by
breathing
on
a
plate
of
glass
and
immediately
after
pressing
the
other
upon
it
the
colours
then
appear
as
in
the
case
of
two
glasses
unbreathed
upon
with
this
difference
that
the
moisture
occasions
here
and
there
an
interruption
of
the
undulations
on
pushing
one
glass
away
from
the
other
the
moisture
appears
iridescent
as
it
evaporates
it
might
however
be
asserted
that
this
combined
experiment
exhibits
no
more
than
each
single
experiment
for
it
appears
the
colours
excited
by
pressure
disappear
in
proportion
as
the
glasses
are
less
in
contact
and
the
moisture
then
evaporates
with
its
own
colours
fourth
iridescent
appearances
are
observable
in
almost
all
bubbles
are
the
most
commonly
known
and
the
effect
in
question
is
thus
exhibited
in
the
easiest
mode
but
it
may
be
observed
in
wine
beer
in
pure
spirit
and
again
especially
in
the
froth
of
chocolate
as
in
the
above
cases
we
required
an
infinitely
narrow
space
between
two
surfaces
which
are
in
contact
so
we
can
consider
the
pellicle
of
the
as
an
infinitely
thin
lamina
between
two
elastic
bodies
for
the
appearance
in
fact
takes
place
between
the
air
within
which
distends
the
bubble
and
the
atmospheric
air
the
bubble
when
first
produced
is
colourless
then
coloured
stripes
like
those
in
marble
paper
begin
to
appear
these
at
length
spread
over
the
whole
surface
or
rather
are
driven
round
it
as
it
is
distended
in
a
single
bubble
suffered
to
hang
from
the
straw
or
tube
the
appearance
of
colour
is
difficult
to
observe
for
the
quick
rotation
prevents
any
accurate
observation
and
all
the
colours
seem
to
mix
together
yet
we
can
perceive
that
the
colours
begin
at
the
orifice
of
the
tube
the
solution
itself
may
however
be
blown
into
carefully
so
that
only
one
bubble
shall
appear
this
remains
white
colourless
if
not
much
agitated
but
if
the
solution
is
not
too
watery
circles
appear
round
the
perpendicular
axis
of
the
bubble
these
being
near
each
other
are
commonly
composed
alternately
of
green
and
red
lastly
several
bubbles
may
be
produced
together
by
the
same
means
in
this
case
the
colours
appear
on
the
sides
where
two
bubbles
have
pressed
each
other
flat
the
bubbles
of
may
perhaps
be
even
more
conveniently
observed
than
those
of
soap
though
smaller
they
remain
longer
in
these
owing
to
the
heat
an
impulse
a
movement
is
produced
and
sustained
which
appears
necessary
to
the
development
and
succession
of
the
appearances
if
the
bubble
is
small
or
shut
in
between
others
coloured
lines
chase
each
other
over
the
surface
resembling
marbled
paper
all
the
colours
of
the
scale
are
seen
to
pass
through
each
other
the
pure
the
augmented
the
combined
all
distinctly
clear
and
beautiful
in
small
bubbles
the
appearance
lasts
for
a
considerable
time
if
the
bubble
is
larger
or
if
it
becomes
by
degrees
detached
owing
to
the
bursting
of
others
near
we
perceive
that
this
impulsion
and
attraction
of
the
colours
has
as
it
were
an
end
in
view
for
on
the
highest
point
of
the
bubble
we
see
a
small
circle
appear
which
is
yellow
in
the
centre
the
other
remaining
coloured
lines
move
constantly
round
this
with
a
vermicular
action
in
a
short
time
the
circle
enlarges
and
sinks
downwards
on
all
sides
in
the
centre
the
yellow
remains
below
and
on
the
outside
it
becomes
red
and
soon
blue
below
this
again
appears
a
new
circle
of
the
same
series
of
colours
if
they
approximate
sufficiently
a
green
is
produced
by
the
union
of
the
when
i
could
count
three
such
leading
circles
the
centre
was
colourless
and
this
space
became
by
degrees
larger
as
the
circles
sank
lower
till
at
last
the
bubble
burst
fifth
very
delicate
pellicles
may
be
formed
in
various
ways
on
these
films
we
discover
a
very
lively
play
of
colours
either
in
the
usual
order
or
more
confusedly
passing
through
each
other
the
water
in
which
lime
has
been
slaked
soon
skims
over
with
a
coloured
pellicle
the
same
happens
on
the
surface
of
stagnant
water
especially
if
impregnated
with
iron
the
lamellæ
of
the
fine
tartar
which
adheres
to
bottles
especially
in
red
french
wine
exhibit
the
most
brilliant
colours
on
being
exposed
to
the
light
if
carefully
detached
drops
of
oil
on
water
brandy
and
other
fluids
produce
also
similar
circles
and
brilliant
effects
but
the
most
beautiful
experiment
that
can
be
made
is
the
following
let
aqua
fortis
not
too
strong
be
poured
into
a
flat
saucer
and
then
with
a
brush
drop
on
it
some
of
the
varnish
used
by
engravers
to
cover
certain
portions
during
the
process
of
biting
their
plates
after
quick
commotion
there
presently
appears
a
film
which
spreads
itself
out
in
circles
and
immediately
produces
the
most
vivid
appearances
of
colour
sixth
when
metals
are
heated
colours
rapidly
succeeding
each
other
appear
on
the
surface
these
colours
can
however
be
arrested
at
will
if
a
piece
of
polished
steel
is
heated
it
will
at
a
certain
degree
of
warmth
be
overspread
with
yellow
if
taken
suddenly
away
from
the
fire
this
yellow
remains
as
the
steel
becomes
hotter
the
yellow
appears
darker
intenser
and
presently
passes
into
red
this
is
difficult
to
arrest
for
it
hastens
very
quickly
to
bright
blue
this
beautiful
blue
is
to
be
arrested
if
the
steel
is
suddenly
taken
out
of
the
heat
and
buried
in
ashes
the
blue
steel
works
are
produced
in
this
way
if
again
the
steel
is
held
longer
over
the
fire
it
soon
becomes
a
light
blue
and
so
it
remains
these
colours
pass
like
a
breath
over
the
plate
of
steel
each
seems
to
fly
before
the
other
but
in
reality
each
successive
hue
is
constantly
developed
from
the
preceding
one
if
we
hold
a
penknife
in
the
flame
of
a
light
a
coloured
stripe
will
appear
across
the
blade
the
portion
of
the
stripe
which
was
nearest
to
the
flame
is
light
blue
this
melts
into
the
red
is
in
the
centre
then
follow
and
yellow
this
phenomenon
is
deducible
from
the
preceding
ones
for
the
portion
of
the
blade
next
the
handle
is
less
heated
than
the
end
which
is
in
the
flame
and
thus
all
the
colours
which
in
other
cases
exhibited
themselves
in
succession
must
here
appear
at
once
and
may
thus
be
permanently
preserved
robert
boyle
gives
this
succession
of
colours
as
follows
a
florido
flavo
ad
flavum
saturum
et
rubescentem
quem
artifices
sanguineum
vocant
inde
ad
languidum
postea
ad
saturiorem
cyaneum
this
would
be
quite
correct
if
the
words
languidus
and
saturior
were
to
change
places
how
far
the
observation
is
correct
that
the
different
colours
have
a
relation
to
the
degree
of
temper
which
the
metal
afterwards
acquires
we
leave
to
others
to
decide
the
colours
are
here
only
indications
of
the
different
degrees
of
note
when
lead
is
calcined
the
surface
is
first
greyish
this
greyish
powder
with
greater
heat
becomes
yellow
and
then
orange
silver
too
exhibits
colours
when
heated
the
fracture
of
silver
in
the
process
of
refining
belongs
to
the
same
class
of
examples
when
metallic
glasses
melt
colours
in
like
manner
appear
on
the
surface
seventh
when
the
surface
of

becomes

the
accidental
opacity
blindwerden
of

has
been
already
noticed
the
term
blindwerden
is
employed
to
denote
that
the
surface
of
the

is
so
affected
as
to
appear
dim
to
us
white

it
is
that
which
in
the
oven
lies
uppermost
on
which
one
may
observe
roundish
elevations
it
is
smoother
than
the
other
which
is
undermost
in
the
oven
and
on
which
scratches
may
be
sometimes
observed
on
this
account
the
mirror
side
is
placed
facing
the
interior
of
rooms
because
it
is
less
affected
by
the
moisture
adhering
to
it
from
within
than
the
other
would
be
and
the
glass
is
thus
less
liable
to
become
blind
this
or
dimness
of
the
glass
assumes
by
degrees
an
appearance
of
colour
which
may
become
very
vivid
and
in
which
perhaps
a
certain
succession
or
otherwise
regular
order
might
be
discovered
having
thus
traced
the
physical
colours
from
their
simplest
effects
to
the
present
instances
where
these
fleeting
appearances
are
found
to
be
fixed
in
bodies
we
are
in
fact
arrived
at
the
point
where
the
chemical
colours
begin
nay
we
have
in
some
sort
already
passed
those
limits
a
circumstance
which
may
excite
a
favourable
prejudice
for
the
consistency
of
our
statement
by
way
of
conclusion
to
this
part
of
our
inquiry
we
subjoin
a
general
observation
which
may
not
be
without
its
bearing
on
the
common
connecting
principle
of
the
phenomena
that
have
been
adduced
the
colouring
of
steel
and
the
appearances
analogous
to
it
might
perhaps
be
easily
deduced
from
the
doctrine
of
the
mediums
polished
steel
reflects
light
powerfully
we
may
consider
the
colour
produced
by
the
heat
as
a
slight
degree
of
dimness
hence
a
bright
yellow
must
immediately
appear
this
as
the
dimness
increases
must
still
appear
deeper
more
condensed
and
redder
and
at
last
pure
and
the
colour
has
now
reached
the
extreme
point
of
depth
and
if
we
suppose
the
same
degree
of
still
to
continue
the
dimness
would
now
spread
itself
over
a
dark
ground
first
producing
a
violet
then
a
and
at
last
a
and
thus
complete
the
series
of
the
appearances
we
will
not
assert
that
this
mode
of
explanation
will
suffice
in
all
cases
our
object
is
rather
to
point
out
the
road
by
which
the
formula
the
very
key
of
the
enigma
may
be
at
last
note
part
iii
chemical
colours
we
give
this
denomination
to
colours
which
we
can
produce
and
more
or
less
fix
in
certain
bodies
which
we
can
render
more
intense
which
we
can
again
take
away
and
communicate
to
other
bodies
and
to
which
therefore
we
ascribe
a
certain
permanency
duration
is
their
prevailing
characteristic
in
this
view
the
chemical
colours
were
formerly
distinguished
with
various
epithets
they
were
called
proprii
corporei
materiales
veri
permanentes
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
observed
how
the
fluctuating
and
transient
nature
of
the
physical
colours
becomes
gradually
fixed
thus
forming
the
natural
transition
to
our
present
subject
colour
becomes
fixed
in
bodies
more
or
less
permanently
superficially
or
thoroughly
all
bodies
are
susceptible
of
colour
it
can
either
be
excited
rendered
intense
and
gradually
fixed
in
them
or
at
least
communicated
to
them
xxxiv
chemical
contrast
in
the
examination
of
coloured
appearances
we
had
occasion
everywhere
to
take
notice
of
a
principle
of
contrast
so
again
in
approaching
the
precincts
of
chemistry
we
find
a
chemical
contrast
of
a
remarkable
nature
we
speak
here
with
reference
to
our
present
purpose
only
of
that
which
is
comprehended
under
the
general
names
of
acid
and
alkali
we
characterised
the
chromatic
contrast
in
conformity
with
all
other
physical
contrasts
as
a
and
ascribing
the
to
the
yellow
side
the
to
the
blue
and
we
now
find
that
these
two
divisions
correspond
with
the
chemical
contrasts
the
yellow
and
affect
the
acids
the
blue
and
the
alkalis
thus
the
phenomena
of
chemical
colours
although
still
necessarily
mixed
up
with
other
considerations
admit
of
being
traced
with
sufficient
simplicity
the
principal
phenomena
in
chemical
colours
are
produced
by
the
oxydation
of
metals
and
it
will
be
seen
how
important
this
consideration
is
at
the
outset
other
facts
which
come
into
the
account
and
which
are
worthy
of
attention
will
be
examined
under
separate
heads
in
doing
this
we
however
expressly
state
that
we
only
propose
to
offer
some
preparatory
suggestions
to
the
chemist
in
a
very
general
way
without
entering
into
the
nicer
chemical
problems
and
questions
or
presuming
to
decide
on
them
our
object
is
only
to
give
a
sketch
of
the
mode
in
which
according
to
our
conviction
the
chemical
theory
of
colours
may
be
connected
with
general
physics
xxxv
white
in
treating
of
the
dioptrical
colours
of
the
first
class
we
have
already
in
some
degree
anticipated
this
subject
transparent
substances
may
be
said
to
be
in
the
highest
class
of
inorganic
matter
with
these
colourless
is
closely
connected
and
white
may
be
considered
the
last
opaque
degree
of
this
pure
water
crystallised
to
snow
appears
white
for
the
transparence
of
the
separate
parts
makes
no
transparent
whole
various
crystallised
salts
when
deprived
to
a
certain
extent
of
moisture
appear
as
a
white
powder
the
accidentally
opaque
state
of
a
pure
transparent
substance
might
be
called
white
thus
pounded
glass
appears
as
a
white
powder
the
cessation
of
a
combining
power
and
the
exhibition
of
the
atomic
quality
of
the
substance
might
at
the
same
time
be
taken
into
the
account
the
known
undecomposed
earths
are
in
their
pure
state
all
white
they
pass
to
a
state
of
transparence
by
natural
crystallization
silex
becomes
argile
mica
magnesia
talc
calcareous

and
barytes
appear
transparent
in
various
note
as
in
the
colouring
of
mineral
bodies
the
metallic
oxydes
will
often
invite
our
attention
we
observe
in
conclusion
that
metals
when
slightly
oxydated
at
first
appear
white
as
lead
is
converted
to
white
lead
by
vegetable
acid
xxxvi
black
black
is
not
exhibited
in
so
elementary
a
state
as
white
we
meet
with
it
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
in
and
charcoal
a
substance
especially
worthy
of
attention
on
other
accounts
exhibits
a
black
colour
again
if
woods
for
example
boards
owing
to
the
action
of
light
air
and
moisture
are
deprived
in
part
of
their
combustibility
there
appears
first
the
grey
then
the
black
colour
so
again
we
can
convert
even
portions
of
animal
substance
to
charcoal
by
in
the
same
manner
we
often
find
that
a
takes
place
in
metals
when
the
black
colour
is
to
be
produced
various
metals
particularly
iron
become
black
by
slight
oxydation
by
vinegar
by
mild
acid
fermentations
for
example
a
decoction
of
rice
again
it
may
be
inferred
that
a
may
produce
black
this
occurs
in
the
preparation
of
ink
which
becomes
yellow
by
the
solution
of
iron
in
strong
sulphuric
acid
but
when
partly
by
the
infusion

xxxvii
first
excitation
of
colour
in
the
division
of
physical
colours
where
mediums
were
considered
we
saw
colours
antecedently
to
white
and
black
in
the
present
case
we
assume
a
white
and
black
already
produced
and
fixed
and
the
question
is
how
colour
can
be
excited
in
them
here
too
we
can
say
white
that
becomes
darkened
or
dimmed
inclines
to
yellow
black
as
it
becomes
lighter
inclines
to
note
u
yellow
appears
on
the
active
plus
side
immediately
in
the
light
the
bright
the

all
white
surfaces

assume
a
yellow
tinge
paper
linen
wool

transparent
fluids
again
which
have
a
tendency
to
combustion
easily
become
yellow
in
other
words
they
easily
pass
into
a
very
slight
state
of
so
again
the
excitement
on
the
passive
side
the
tendency
to
obscure
dark
black
is
immediately
accompanied
with
blue
or
rather
with
a
iron
dissolved
in
sulphuric
acid
and
much
diluted
with
water
if
held
to
the
light
in
a
glass
exhibits
a
beautiful
violet
colour
as
soon
as
a
few
drops
only
of
the
infusion
of
are
added
this
colour
presents
the
peculiar
hues
of
the
dark
topaz
the
of
a
as
the
ancients
expressed
it
whether
any
colour
can
be
excited
in
the
pure
earths
by
the
chemical
operations
of
nature
and
art
without
the
admixture
of
metallic
oxydes
is
an
important
question
generally
indeed
answered
in
the
negative
it
is
perhaps
connected
with
the
question
to
what
extent
changes
may
be
produced
in
the
earths
through
oxydation
undoubtedly
the
negation
of
the
above
question
is
confirmed
by
the
circumstance
that
wherever
mineral
colours
are
found
some
trace
of
metal
especially
of
iron
shows
itself
we
are
thus
naturally
led
to
consider
how
easily
iron
becomes
oxydised
how
easily
the
oxyde
of
iron
assumes
different
colours
how
infinitely
divisible
it
is
and
how
quickly
it
communicates
its
colour
it
were
to
be
wished
notwithstanding
that
new
experiments
could
be
made
in
regard
to
the
above
point
so
as
either
to
confirm
or
remove
any
doubt
however
this
may
be
the
susceptibility
of
the
earths
with
regard
to
colours
already
existing
is
very
great
aluminous
earth
is
thus
particularly
distinguished
in
proceeding
to
consider
the
metals
which
in
the
inorganic
world
have
the
almost
exclusive
prerogative
of
appearing
coloured
we
find
that
in
their
pure
independent
natural
state
they
are
already
distinguished
from
the
pure
earths
by
a
tendency
to
some
one
colour
or
other
while
silver
approximates
most
to
pure
white
nay
really
represents
pure
white
heightened
by
metallic
splendour
steel
tin
lead
and
so
forth
incline
towards
pale
gold
on
the
other
hand
deepens
to
pure
yellow
copper
approaches
a
red
hue
which
under
certain
circumstances
increases
almost
to
bright
red
but
which
again
returns
to
a
yellow
golden
colour
when
combined
with
zinc
but
if
metals
in
their
pure
state
have
so
specific
a
determination
towards
this
or
that
exhibition
of
colour
they
are
through
the
effect
of
oxydation
in
some
degree
reduced
to
a
common
character
for
the
elementary
colours
now
come
forth
in
their
purity
and
although
this
or
that
metal
appears
to
have
a
particular
tendency
to
this
or
that
colour
we
find
some
that
can
go
through
the
whole
circle
of
hues
others
that
are
capable
of
exhibiting
more
than
one
colour
tin
however
is
distinguished
by
its
comparative
inaptitude
to
become
coloured
we
propose
to
give
a
table
hereafter
showing
how
far
the
different
metals
can
be
more
or
less
made
to
exhibit
the
different
colours
when
the
clean
smooth
surface
of
a
pure
metal
on
being
heated
becomes
overspread
with
a
mantling
colour
which
passes
through
a
series
of
appearances
as
the
heat
increases
this
we
are
persuaded
indicates
the
aptitude
of
the
metal
to
pass
through
the
whole
range
of
colours
we
find
this
phenomenon
most
beautifully
exhibited
in
polished
steel
but
silver
copper
brass
lead
and
tin
easily
present
similar
appearances
a
superficial
oxydation
is
probably
here
taking
place
as
may
be
inferred
from
the
effects
of
the
operation
when
continued
especially
in
the
more
easily
oxydizable
metals
the
same
conclusion
may
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
iron
is
more
easily
oxydizable
by
acid
liquids
when
it
is
red
hot
for
in
this
case
the
two
effects
concur
with
each
other
we
observe
again
that
steel
accordingly
as
it
is
hardened
in
different
stages
of
its
colorification
may
exhibit
a
difference
of
elasticity
this
is
quite
natural
for
the
various
appearances
of
colour
indicate
various
degrees
of
heat
if
we
look
beyond
this
superficial
mantling
this
pellicle
of
colour
we
observe
that
as
metals
are
oxydized
throughout
their
masses
white
or
black
appears
with
the
first
degree
of
heat
as
may
be
seen
in
white
lead
iron
and
quicksilver
if
we
examine
further
and
look
for
the
actual
exhibition
of
colour
we
find
it
most
frequently
on
the
side
the
mantling
so
often
mentioned
of
smooth
metallic
surfaces
begins
with
yellow
iron
passes
presently
into
yellow
ochre
lead
from
white
lead
to
massicot
quicksilver
from
æthiops
to
yellow
turbith
the
solutions
of
gold
and
platinum
in
acids
are
yellow
the
exhibitions
on
the
side
are
less
frequent
copper
slightly
oxydized
appears
blue
in
the
preparation
of
alkalis
are
employed
generally
however
these
appearances
of
colour
are
of
so
mutable
a
nature
that
chemists
look
upon
them
as
deceptive
tests
at
least
in
the
nicer
gradations
for
ourselves
as
we
can
only
treat
of
these
matters
in
a
general
way
we
merely
observe
that
the
appearances
of
colour
in
metals
may
be
classed
according
to
their
origin
manifold
appearance
and
cessation
as
various
results
of
oxydation
and
see
par
as
these
terms
are
afterwards
referred
to
par
it
was
necessary
to
preserve
them
xxxviii
augmentation
of
colour
the
augmentation
of
colour
exhibits
itself
as
a
condensation
a
fulness
a
darkening
of
the
hue
we
have
before
seen
in
treating
of
colourless
mediums
that
by
increasing
the
degree
of
opacity
in
the
medium
we
can
deepen
a
bright
object
from
the
lightest
yellow
to
the
intensest
blue
on
the
other
hand
increases
to
the
most
beautiful
violet
if
we
rarefy
and
diminish
a
medium
itself
lighted
but
through
which
we
see
darkness
if
the
colour
is
positive
a
similar
colour
appears
in
the
intenser
state
thus
if
we
fill
a
white
porcelain
cup
with
a
pure
yellow
liquor
the
fluid
will
appear
to
become
gradually
redder
towards
the
bottom
and
at
last
appears
orange
if
we
pour
a
pure
blue
solution
into
another
cup
the
upper
portion
will
exhibit
a
that
towards
the
bottom
a
beautiful
violet
if
the
cup
is
placed
in
the
sun
the
shadowed
side
even
of
the
upper
portion
is
already
violet
if
we
throw
a
shadow
with
the
hand
or
any
other
substance
over
the
illumined
portion
the
shadow
in
like
manner
appears
reddish
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
appearances
connected
with
the
doctrine
of
colours
for
we
here
manifestly
find
that
a
difference
of
quantity
produces
a
corresponding
qualified
impression
on
our
senses
in
speaking
of
the
last
class
of
epoptical
colours
we
stated
our
conjecture
that
the
colouring
of
steel
might
perhaps
be
traced
to
the
doctrine
of
the
mediums
and
we
would
here
again
recall
this
to
the
reader
recollection
all
chemical
augmentation
of
colour
again
is
the
immediate
consequence
of
continued
excitation
the
augmentation
advances
constantly
and
unremittingly
and
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
increase
of
intenseness
is
most
common
on
the
side
yellow
iron
ochre
increases
as
well
by
fire
as
by
other
operations
to
a
very
strong
red
massicot
is
increased
to
red
lead
turbith
to
vermilion
which
last
attains
a
very
high
degree
of
the
an
intimate
saturation
of
the
metal
by
the
acid
and
its
separation
to
infinity
take
place
together
with
the
above
effects
the
augmentation
on
the
side
is
less
frequent
but
we
observe
that
the
more
pure
and
condensed
the
or
cobalt
glass
is
prepared
the
more
readily
it
assumes
a
reddish
hue
and
inclines
to
the
violet
the
french
have
a
happy
expression
for
the
less
perceptible
tendency
of
yellow
and
blue
towards
red
they
say
the
colour
has
un
œil
de
rouge
which
we
might
perhaps
express
by
a
reddish
glance

xxxix
culmination
this
is
the
consequence
of
still
progressing
augmentation
red
in
which
neither
yellow
nor
blue
is
to
be
detected
here
constitutes
the
acme
if
we
wish
to
select
a
striking
example
of
a
culmination
on
the
side
we
again
find
it
in
the
coloured
steel
which
attains
the
bright
red
acme
and
can
be
arrested
at
this
point
were
we
here
to
employ
the
terminology
before
proposed
we
should
say
that
the
first
oxydation
produces
yellow
the
that
here
a
kind
of
maximum
exists
and
that
then
an
and
lastly
a

some

matter
for
inquiry
for
an
influence
of
alkalis

still
only

however

it

be

in

offer
very
striking
examples
of
the
above
effects
the

annotto
saffron
and
other
vegetables
being
extracted
with

of
wine
exhibits
tints
of

and
these
by
the
admixture
of

pass
to
the
culminating
point
and
even
beyond

to
no
instance
of
a
culmination

come
to
my
knowledge
in
the
mineral
and
vegetable
kingdoms

kingdom
the
juice
of
the
murex
is
remarkable
of
its
augmentation
and
culmination
on
the
side
we
shall
hereafter
have
occasion
to
speak
the
original
word
it
might
have
been
rendered
of
but
as
the
author
supposes
an
through
yellow
and
blue
to
red
his
meaning
is
better
expressed
by
his
own
term
curcuma
bixa
orellana
carthamus
tinctorius

fluctuation
the
mutability
of
colour
is
so
great
that
even
those
pigments
which
may
have
been
considered
to
be
defined
and
arrested
still
admit
of
slight
variations
on
one
side
or
the
other
this
mutability
is
most
remarkable
near
the
culminating
point
and
is
effected
in
a
very
striking
manner
by
the
alternate
employment
of
acids
and
alkalis
to
express
this
appearance
in
dyeing
the
french
make
use
of
the
word
virer
to
turn
from
one
side
to
the
other
they
thus
very
adroitly
convey
an
idea
which
others
attempt
to
express
by
terms
indicating
the
component
hues
the
effect
produced
with
litmus
is
one
of
the
most
known
and
striking
of
this
kind
this
colouring
substance
is
tendered
by
means
of
alkalis
the
is
very
readily
changed
to
by
means
of
acids
and
again
returns
to
its
first
state
by
again
employing
alkalis
the
question
whether
a
culminating
point
is
to
be
discovered
and
arrested
by
nice
experiments
is
left
to
those
who
are
practised
in
these
operations
dyeing
especially
might
afford
a
variety
of
examples
of
this
fluctuation
xli
passage
through
the
whole
scale
the
first
excitation
and
gradual
increase
of
colour
take
place
more
on
the
than
on
the
side
so
also
in
passing
through
the
whole
scale
colour
exhibits
itself
most
on
the
side
a
passage
of
this
kind
regular
and
evident
to
the
senses
from
yellow
through
red
to
blue
is
apparent
in
the
colouring
of
steel
the
metals
may
be
arrested
at
various
points
of
the
colorific
circle
by
various
degrees
and
kinds
of
oxydation
as
they
also
appear
green
a
question
arises
whether
chemists
know
any
instance
in
the
mineral
kingdom
of
a
constant
transition
from
yellow
through
green
to
blue
and
oxyde
of
iron
melted
with
glass
produces
first
a
green
and
with
a
more
powerful
heat
a
blue
colour
we
may
here
observe
of
green
generally
that
it
appears
especially
in
an
atomic
sense
and
certainly
in
a
pure
state
when
we
mix
blue
and
yellow
but
again
an
impure
and
dirty
yellow
soon
gives
us
the
impression
of
green
yellow
and
black
already
produce
green
this
however
is
owing
to
the
affinity
between
black
and
blue
an
imperfect
yellow
such
as
that
of
sulphur
gives
us
the
impression
of
a
greenish
hue
thus
again
an
imperfect
blue
appears
green
the
green
of
wine
bottles
arises
it
appears
from
an
imperfect
union
of
the
oxyde
of
iron
with
the
glass
if
we
produce
a
more
complete
union
by
greater
heat
a
beautiful
is
the
result
from
all
this
it
appears
that
a
certain
chasm
exists
in
nature
between
yellow
and
blue
the
opposite
characters
of
which
it
is
true
may
be
done
away
atomically
by
due
immixture
and
thus
combined
to
green
but
the
true
reconciliation
between
yellow
and
blue
it
seems
only
takes
place
by
means
of
red
the
process
however
which
appears
unattainable
in
inorganic
substances
we
shall
find
to
be
possible
when
we
turn
our
attention
to
organic
productions
for
in
these
the
passage
through
the
whole
circle
from
yellow
through
green
and
blue
to
red
really
takes
place
xlii
inversion
again
an
immediate
inversion
or
change
to
the
totally
opposite
hue
is
a
very
remarkable
appearance
which
sometimes
occurs
at
present
we
are
merely
enabled
to
adduce
what
follows
the
mineral
chameleon
a
name
which
has
been
given
to
an
oxyde
of
manganese
may
be
considered
in
its
perfectly
dry
state
as
a
green
powder
if
we
strew
it
in
water
the
green
colour
displays
itself
very
beautifully
in
the
first
moment
of
solution
but
it
changes
presently
to
the
bright
red
opposite
to
green
without
any
apparent
intermediate
state
the
same
occurs
with
the
sympathetic
ink
which
may
be
considered
a
reddish
liquid
but
which
when
dried
by
warmth
appears
as
a
green
colour
on
paper
in
fact
this
phenomenon
appears
to
be
owing
to
the
conflict
between
a
dry
and
moist
state
as
has
been
already
observed
if
we
are
not
mistaken
by
the
chemists
we
may
look
to
the
improvements
of
time
to
point
out
what
may
further
be
deduced
from
these
phenomena
and
to
show
what
other
facts
they
may
be
connected
with
xliii
fixation
mutable
as
we
have
hitherto
found
colour
to
be
even
as
a
substance
yet
under
certain
circumstances
it
may
at
last
be
fixed
there
are
bodies
capable
of
being
entirely
converted
into
colouring
matter
here
it
may
be
said
that
the
colour
fixes
itself
in
its
own
substance
stops
at
a
certain
point
and
is
there
defined
such
colouring
substances
are
found
throughout
nature
the
vegetable
world
affords
a
great
quantity
of
examples
among
which
some
are
particularly
distinguished
and
may
be
considered
as
the
representatives
of
the
rest
such
as
on
the
active
side
madder
on
the
passive
side
indigo
in
order
to
make
these
materials
available
in
use
it
is
necessary
that
the
colouring
quality
in
them
should
be
intimately
condensed
and
the
tinging
substance
refined
practically
speaking
to
an
infinite
divisibility
this
is
accomplished
in
various
ways
and
particularly
by
the
means
of
fermentation
and
decomposition
these
colouring
substances
now
attach
themselves
again
to
other
bodies
thus
in
the
mineral
kingdom
they
adhere
to
earths
and
metallic
oxydes
they
unite
in
melting
with
glasses
and
in
this
case
as
the
light
is
transmitted
through
them
they
appear
in
the
greatest
beauty
while
an
eternal
duration
may
be
ascribed
to
them
they
fasten
on
vegetable
and
animal
bodies
with
more
or
less
power
and
remain
more
or
less
permanently
partly
owing
to
their
nature
as
yellow
for
instance
is
more
evanescent
than
blue
or
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
substance
on
which
they
appear
they
last
less
in
vegetable
than
in
animal
substances
and
even
within
this
latter
kingdom
there
are
again
varieties
hemp
or
cotton
threads
silk
or
wool
exhibit
very
different
relations
to
colouring
substances
here
comes
into
the
account
the
important
operation
of
employing
mordants
which
may
be
considered
as
the
intermediate
agents
between
the
colour
and
the
recipient
substance
various
works
on
dyeing
speak
of
this
circumstantially
suffice
it
to
have
alluded
to
processes
by
means
of
which
the
colour
retains
a
permanency
only
to
be
destroyed
with
the
substance
and
which
may
even
increase
in
brightness
and
beauty

xliv
intermixture
real
every
intermixture
a
specific
state
of
colour
and
thus
when
we
speak
of
intermixture
we
here
understand
it
in
an
atomic
sense
we
must
first
have
before
us
certain
bodies
arrested
at
any
given
point
of
the
colorific
circle
before
we
can
produce
gradations
by
their

red
may
be
assumed
as
pure
elementary
colours
already
existing
from
these
violet
orange
and
green
are
the
simplest
combined
results
some
persons
have
taken
much
pains
to
define
these
intermixtures
more
accurately
by
relations
of
number
measure
and
weight
but
nothing
very
profitable
has
been
thus
accomplished
painting
consists
strictly
speaking
in
the
intermixture
of
such
specific
colouring
bodies
and
their
infinite
possible
combinations
combinations
which
can
only
be
appreciated
by
the
nicest
most
practised
eye
and
only
accomplished
under
its
influence
the
intimate
combination
of
these
ingredients
is
effected
in
the
first
instance
through
the
most
perfect
comminution
of
the
material
by
means
of
grinding
washing
as
well
as
by
vehicles
or
liquid
mediums
which
hold
together
the
pulverized
substance
and
combine
organically

it
were
the

are
the

if
all

no

is

the
result
is
grey
which
like
apparent
colour
always
appears
somewhat
darker
than
white
and
somewhat
lighter
than

this
grey
may
be
produced
in
various
ways
by
mixing
yellow
and
blue
to
an
emerald

and
then
adding
pure

neutralize

or
by
placing
the

colours
next
each
other
in
a
certain
proportion
and
afterwards
mixing
them
that
all
the
colours

an
absurdity

have
credulously
been

to
repeat
for
a

intermixture

the
intermixture
which
is
only
apparent
naturally
invites
our
attention
in
connexion
with
the
foregoing
it
is
in
many
respects
important
and
indeed
the
intermixture
which
we
have
distinguished
as
real
might
be
considered
as
merely
apparent
for
the
elements
of
which
the
combined
colour
consists
are
only
too
small
to
be
considered
as
distinct
parts
yellow
and
blue
powders
mingled
together
appear
green
to
the
naked
eye
but
through
a
magnifying
glass
we
can
still
perceive
yellow
and
blue
distinct
from
each
other
thus
yellow
and
blue
stripes
seen
at
a
distance
present
a
green
mass
the
same
observation
is
applicable
with
regard
to
the
intermixture
of
other
specific
colours
in
the
description
of
our
apparatus
we
shall
have
occasion
to
mention
the
wheel
by
means
of
which
the
apparent
intermixture
is
produced
by
rapid
movement
various
colours
are
arranged
near
each
other
round
the
edge
of
a
disk
which
is
made
to
revolve
with
velocity
and
thus
by
having
several
such
disks
ready
every
possible
intermixture
can
be
presented
to
the
eye
as
well
as
the
mixture
of
all
colours
to
grey
darker
or
lighter
according
to
the
depth
of
the
tints
as
above
explained
physiological
colours
admit
in
like
manner
of
being
mixed
with
others
if
for
example
we
produce
the
blue
shadow
on
a
light
yellow
paper
the
surface
will
appear
green
the
same
happens
with
regard
to
the
other
colours
if
the
necessary
preparations
are
attended
to
if
when
the
eye
is
impressed
with
visionary
images
that
last
for
a
while
we
look
on
coloured
surfaces
an
intermixture
also
takes
place
the
spectrum
is
determined
to
a
new
colour
which
is
composed
of
the
two
physical
colours
also
admit
of
combination
here
might
be
adduced
the
experiments
in
which
images
are
seen
through
the
prism
as
we
have
before
shown
in
detail
those
who
have
prosecuted
these
inquiries
have
however
paid
most
attention
to
the
appearances
which
take
place
when
the
prismatic
colours
are
thrown
on
coloured
surfaces
what
is
seen
under
these
circumstances
is
quite
simple
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
prismatic
colours
are
much
more
vivid
than
the
colours
of
the
surface
on
which
they
are
thrown
secondly
we
have
to
consider
that
the
prismatic
colours
may
be
either
homogeneous
or
heterogeneous
with
the
recipient
surface
in
the
former
case
the
surface
deepens
and
enhances
them
and
is
itself
enhanced
in
return
as
a
coloured
stone
is
displayed
by
a
similarly
coloured
foil
in
the
opposite
case
each
vitiates
disturbs
and
destroys
the
other
these
experiments
may
be
repeated
with
coloured
glasses
by
causing
the
to
shine
through
them
on
coloured
surfaces
in
every
instance
similar
results
will
appear
the
same
effect
takes
place
when
we
look
on
coloured
objects
through
coloured
glasses
the
colours
being
thus
according
to
the
same
conditions
enhanced
subdued
or
neutralized
if
the
prismatic
colours
are
suffered
to
pass
through
coloured
glasses
the
appearances
that
take
place
are
perfectly
analogous
in
these
cases
more
or
less
force
more
or
less
light
and
dark
the
clearness
and
cleanness
of
the
glass
are
all
to
be
allowed
for
as
they
produce
many
delicate
varieties
of
effect
these
will
not
escape
the
notice
of
every
accurate
observer
who
takes
sufficient
interest
in
the
inquiry
to
go
through
the
experiments
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
mention
that
several
coloured
glasses
as
well
as
oiled
or
transparent
papers
placed
over
each
other
may
be
made
to
produce
and
exhibit
every
kind
of
intermixture
at
pleasure
lastly
the
operation
of
glazing
in
painting
belongs
to
this
kind
of
intermixture
by
this
means
a
much
more
refined
union
may
be
produced
than
that
arising
from
the
mechanical
atomic
mixture
which
is
commonly
employed
xlvi

actual
having
now
provided
the
colouring
materials
as
before
shown
a
further
question
arises
how
to
communicate
these
to
colourless
substances
the
answer
is
of
the
greatest
importance
from
the
connexion
of
the
object
with
the
ordinary
wants
of
men
with
useful
purposes
and
with
commercial
and
technical
interests
here
again
the
dark
quality
of
every
colour
again
comes
into
the
account
from
a
yellow
that
is
very
near
to
white
through
orange
and
the
hue
of
minium
to
pure
red
and
carmine
through
all
gradations
of
violet
to
the
deepest
blue
which
is
almost
identified
with

colour
still
increases

of
being
diluted
made

united
with

and
then
as
green
it
approaches
the
light
side
of
the
scale
but
this
is
by
no
means
according
to
its
own
nature
in
the
physiological
colours
we
have
already
seen
that
they
are
less
than
the
light
inasmuch
as
they
are
a
repetition
of
an
impression
of
light
nay
at
last
they
leave
this
impression
quite
as
a
dark
in
physical
experiments
the
employment
of
mediums
the
effect
of
accessory
images
taught
us
that
in
such
cases
we
have
to
do
with
a
subdued
light
with
a
transition
to
darkness
in
treating
of
the
chemical
origin
of
pigments
we
found
that
the
same
effect
was
produced
on
the
very
first
excitement
the
yellow
tinge
which
mantles
over
the
steel
already
darkens
the
shining
surface
in
changing

to

it
is
evident
that
the
yellow
is
darker
than
white
this
process
is
in
the
highest
degree
delicate
the
growing
intenseness
as
it
still
increases
tinges
the
substance
more
and
more
intimately
and
powerfully
and
thus
indicates
the
extreme
fineness
and
the
infinite
divisibility
of
the
coloured
atoms
the
colours
which
approach
the
dark
side
and
consequently
blue
in
particular
can
be
made
to
approximate
to
black
in
fact
a
very
perfect

or
an

acted

by
vitriolic

almost
as

a
remarkable
appearance
may
be
here
adverted
to
pigments
in
their
deepest

most
condensed
state

those

from
the

kingdom

as

vessels
with

bottoms
in
these
every
infusion
will
appear
black
and
colourless
if
we
place
a
black
surface
under
them
if
we
contrive
that
the
image
of
a
flame
be
reflected
from
the
bottom
the
image
will
appear
coloured
if
we
lift
up
the
vessel
and
suffer
the
transmitted
light
to
fall

paper

on

every

seen

the
colour
of
the

thus
every
colour
in

to
be
seen
must
have
a
light
within
or
behind
it
hence
the
lighter
and
brighter
the

are
the
more
brilliant
the
colours
appear
if
we
pass
over
a
shining

the
splendour
of
the

is
displayed
by
this
internally
reflected
light
as
powerfully
as
in
any
prismatic
experiment
nay
the
force
of
the
physical
colours
is
owing
principally
to
the
circumstance
that
light
is
always
acting

to
the

circumstances
in
which
he

good
an
observer
and
too
acute

to
explain
and
classify
after
his
fashion
what
was
evident
to
his
senses
he
says
in
the
preface
to
delaval
it
appears
to
me
also
on
other
grounds
probable
that
our
organ
in
order
to
be
impressed
by
a
colour
must
at
the
same
time
be
impressed
by
all
light
white
to
procure
white
as
a

the
chief
business
of
the
dyer
every
colour
may
be
easily
communicated
to
colourless
earths
especially
to
alum
but
the
dyer
has
especially
to
do
with
animal
and
vegetable
products
as
the
ground
of
his
operations
everything
living
tends
to
colour
to
local
specific
colour

the
minutest
atoms
everything
in
which
life
is

approximates

the
general
state
to
clearness
to
transparence
how
this
is
put
in
practice
in
technical
operations
remains
to
be
adverted
to
in
the
chapter
on
the
privation
of
colour
with
regard
to
the
communication
of
colour
we
have
especially
to
bear
in
mind
that
animals
and
vegetables
in
a
living
state
produce
colours
and
hence
their
substances
if
deprived
of
colours
can

more

xlvii
communication
apparent
the
communication
of
colours
real
as
well
as
apparent
corresponds
as
may
easily
be
seen
with
their
intermixture
we
need
not
therefore
repeat
what
has
been
already
sufficiently
entered
into
yet
we
may
here
point
out
more
circumstantially
the
importance
of
an
apparent
communication
which
takes
place
by
means
of
reflection
this
phenomenon
is
well
known
but
still
it
is
pregnant
with
inferences
and
is
of
the
greatest
importance
both
to
the
investigator
of
nature
and
to
the
painter
let
a
surface
coloured
with
any
one
of
the
positive
colours
be
placed
in
the
sun
and
let
its
reflection
be
thrown
on
other
colourless
objects
this
reflection
is
a
kind
of
subdued
light
a
a
which
in
a
subdued
state
reflects
the
colours
in
question
if
this
reflection
acts
on
light
surfaces
it
is
so
far
overpowered
that
we
can
scarcely
perceive
the
colour
which
accompanies
it
but
if
it
acts
on
shadowed
portions
a
sort
of
magical
union
takes
place
with
the
σκιερῷ
shadow
is
the
proper
element
of
colour
and
in
this
case
a
subdued
colour
approaches
it
lighting
up
tinging
and
enlivening
it
and
thus
arises
an
appearance
as
powerful
as
agreeable
which
may
render
the
most
pleasing
service
to
the
painter
who
knows
how
to
make
use
of
it
these
are
the
types
of
the
reflexes
which
were
only
noticed
late
in
the
history
of
art
and
which
have
been
too
seldom
employed
in
their
full
variety
the
schoolmen
called
these
colours
and
and
the
history
of
the
doctrine
of
colours
will
generally
show
that
the
old
inquirers
already
observed
the
phenomena
well
enough
and
knew
how
to
distinguish
them
properly
although
the
whole
method
of
treating
such
subjects
is
very
different
from
ours
xlviii
extraction
colour
may
be
extracted
from
substances
whether
they
possess
it
naturally
or
by
communication
in
various
ways
we
have
thus
the
power
to
remove
it
intentionally
for
a
useful
purpose
but
on
the
other
hand
it
often
flies
contrary
to
our
wish
not
only
are
the
elementary
earths
in
their
natural
state
white
but
vegetable
and
animal
substances
can
be
reduced
to
a
white
state
without
disturbing
their
texture
a
pure
white
is
very
desirable
for
various
uses
as
in
the
instance
of
our
preferring
to
use
linen
and
cotton
stuffs
uncoloured
in
like
manner
some
silk
stuffs
paper
and
other
substances
are
the
more
agreeable
the
whiter
they
can
be
again
the
chief
basis
of
all
dyeing
consists
in
white
grounds
for
these
reasons
manufacturers
aided
by
accident
and
contrivance
have
devoted
themselves
assiduously
to
discover
means
of
extracting
colour
infinite
experiments
have
been
made
in
connexion
with
this
object
and
many
important
facts
have
been
arrived
at
it
is
in
accomplishing
this
entire
extraction
of
colour
that
the
operation
of
bleaching
consists
which
is
very
generally
practised
empirically
or
methodically
we
will
here
shortly
state
the
leading
principles
light
is
considered
as
one
of
the
first
means
of
extracting
colour
from
substances
and
not
only
the
but
the
mere
powerless
for
as
both
lights
the
direct
light
of
the
sun
as
well
as
the
derived
light
of
the
sky
kindle
bologna
phosphorus
so
both
act
on
coloured
surfaces
whether
the
light
attacks
the
colour
allied
to
it
and
as
it
were
kindles
and
consumes
it
thus
reducing
the
definite
quality
to
a
general
state
or
whether
some
other
operation
unknown
to
us
takes
place
it
is
clear
that
light
exercises
a
great
power
on
coloured
surfaces
and
bleaches
them
more
or
less
here
however
the
different
colours
exhibit
a
different
degree
of
durability
yellow
especially
if
prepared
from
certain
materials
is
in
this
case
the
first
to
fly
not
only
light
but
air
and
especially
water
act
strongly
in
destroying
colour
it
has
been
even
asserted
that
thread
well
soaked
and
spread
on
the
grass
at
night
bleaches
better
than
that
which
is
exposed
after
soaking
to
the
thus
in
this
case
water
proves
to
be
a
solving
and
conducting
agent
removing
the
accidental
quality
and
restoring
the
substance
to
a
general
or
colourless
state
the
extraction
of
colour
is
also
effected
by
spirits
of
wine
has
a
peculiar
tendency
to
attract
the
juice
which
tinges
plants
and
becomes
coloured
with
it
often
in
a
very
permanent
manner
sulphuric
acid
is
very
efficient
in
removing
colour
especially
from
wool
and
silk
and
every
one
is
acquainted
with
the
use
of
sulphur
vapours
in
bleaching
the
strongest
acids
have
been
recommended
more
recently
as
more
expeditious
agents
in
bleaching
the
alkaline
produce
the
same
effects
by
contrary
means
lixiviums
alone
oils
and
fat
combined
with
lixiviums
to
soap
and
so
forth
before
we
dismiss
this
subject
we
observe
pg
that
it
may
be
well
worth
while
to
make
certain
delicate
experiments
as
to
how
far
light
and
air
exhibit
their
action
in
the
removal
of
colour
it
might
be
possible
to
expose
coloured
substances
to
the
light
under
glass
bells
without
air
or
filled
with
common
or
particular
kinds
of
air
the
colours
might
be
those
of
known
fugacity
and
it
might
be
observed
whether
any
of
the
volatilized
colour
attached
itself
to
the
glass
or
was
otherwise
perceptible
as
a
deposit
or
precipitate
whether
again
in
such
a
case
this
appearance
would
be
perfectly
like
that
which
had
gradually
ceased
to
be
visible
or
whether
it
had
suffered
any
change
skilful
experimentalists
might
devise
various
contrivances
with
a
view
to
such
researches
having
thus
first
considered
the
operations
of
nature
as
subservient
to
our
proposes
we
add
a
few
observations
on
the
modes
in
which
they
act
against
us
the
art
of
painting
is
so
circumstanced
that
the
most
beautiful
results
of
mind
and
labour
are
altered
and
destroyed
in
various
ways
by
time
hence
great
pains
have
been
always
taken
to
find
durable
pigments
and
so
to
unite
them
with
each
other
and
with
their
ground
that
their
permanency
might
be
further
insured
the
technical
history
of
the
schools
of
painting
affords
sufficient
information
on
this
point
we
may
here
too
mention
a
minor
art
to
which
in
relation
to
dyeing
we
are
much
indebted
namely
the
weaving
of
tapestry
as
the
manufacturers
were
enabled
to
imitate
the
most
delicate
shades
of
pictures
and
hence
often
brought
the
most
variously
coloured
materials
together
it
was
soon
observed
that
the
colours
were
not
all
equally
durable
but
that
some
faded
from
the
tapestry
more
quickly
than
others
hence
the
most
diligent
efforts
were
made
to
ensure
an
equal
permanency
to
all
the
colours
and
their
gradations
this
object
was
especially
promoted
in
france
under
colbert
whose
regulations
to
this
effect
constitute
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
dyeing
the
gay
dye
which
only
aimed
at
a
transient
beauty
was
practised
by
a
particular
guild
on
the
other
hand
great
pains
were
taken
to
define
the
technical
processes
which
promised
durability
and
thus
after
considering
the
artificial
extraction
the
evanescence
and
the
perishable
nature
of
brilliant
appearances
of
colour
we
are
again
returned
to
the
desideratum
of
permanency
xlix
nomenclature
after
what
has
been
adduced
respecting
the
origin
the
increase
and
the
affinity
of
colours
we
may
be
better
enabled
to
judge
what
nomenclature
would
be
desirable
in
future
and
what
might
be
retained
of
that
hitherto
in
use
the
nomenclature
of
colours
like
all
other
modes
of
designation
but
especially
those
employed
to
distinguish
the
objects
of
sense
proceeded
in
the
first
instance
from
particular
to
general
and
from
general
back
again
to
particular
terms
the
name
of
the
species
became
a
generic
name
to
which
the
individual
was
again
referred
this
method
might
have
been
followed
in
consequence
of
the
mutability
and
uncertainty
of
ancient
modes
of
expression
especially
since
in
the
early
ages
more
reliance
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
placed
on
the
vivid
impressions
of
sense
the
qualities
of
objects
were
described
indistinctly
because
they
were
impressed
clearly
on
every
imagination
the
pure
chromatic
circle
was
limited
it
is
true
but
specific
as
it
was
it
appears
to
have
been
applied
to
innumerable
objects
while
it
was
circumscribed
by
qualifying
characteristics
if
we
take
a
glance
at
the
copiousness
of
the
greek
and
roman
terms
we
shall
perceive
how
mutable
the
words
were
and
how
easily
each
was
adapted
to
almost
every
point
in
the
colorific
note
in
modern
ages
terms
for
many
new
gradations
were
introduced
in
consequence
of
the
various
operations
of
dyeing
even
the
colours
of
fashion
and
their
designations
represented
an
endless
series
of
specific
hues
we
shall
on
occasion
employ
the
chromatic
terminology
of
modern
languages
whence
it
will
appear
that
the
aim
has
gradually
been
to
introduce
more
exact
definitions
and
to
individualise
and
arrest
a
fixed
and
specific
state
by
language
equally
distinct
with
regard
to
the
german
terminology
it
has
the
advantage
of
possessing
four
monosyllabic
names
no
longer
to
be
traced
to
their
origin
yellow
gelb
blue
red
green
they
represent
the
most
general
idea
of
colour
to
the
imagination
without
reference
to
any
very
specific
modification
if
we
were
to
add
two
other
qualifying
terms
to
each
of
these
four
as
thus
and
and
and
and
we
should
express
the
gradations
of
the
chromatic
circle
with
sufficient
distinctness
and
if
we
were
to
add
the
designations
of
light
and
dark
and
again
define
in
some
measure
the
degree
of
purity
or
its
opposite
by
the
monosyllables
black
white
grey
brown
we
should
have
a
tolerably
sufficient
range
of
expressions
to
describe
the
ordinary
appearances
presented
to
us
without
troubling
ourselves
whether
they
were
produced
dynamically
or
atomically
the
specific
and
proper
terms
in
use
might
however
still
be
conveniently
employed
and
we
have
thus
made
use
of
the
words
orange
and
violet
we
have
in
like
manner
employed
the
word
to
designate
a
pure
central
red
because
the
secretion
of
the
murex
or
is
to
be
carried
to
the
highest
point
of
culmination
by
the
action
of
the
on
fine
linen
saturated
with
the
juice
this
description
is
suffered
to
remain
because
it
accounts
for
the
terminology
employed
t
minerals
the
colours
of
minerals
are
all
of
a
chemical
nature
and
thus
the
modes
in
which
they
are
produced
may
be
explained
in
a
general
way
by
what
has
been
said
on
the
subject
of
chemical
colours
among
the
external
characteristics
of
minerals
the
description
of
their
colours
occupies
the
first
place
and
great
pains
have
been
taken
in
the
spirit
of
modern
times
to
define
and
arrest
every
such
appearance
exactly
by
this
means
however
new
difficulties
it
appears
to
us
have
been
created
which
occasion
no
little
inconvenience
in
practice
it
is
true
this
precision
when
we
reflect
how
it
arose
carries
with
it
its
own
excuse
the
painter
has
at
all
times
been
privileged
in
the
use
of
colours
the
few
specific
hues
in
themselves
admitted
of
no
change
but
from
these
innumerable
gradations
were
artificially
produced
which
imitated
the
surface
of
natural
objects
it
was
therefore
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
these
gradations
should
also
be
adopted
as
criterions
and
that
the
artist
should
be
invited
to
produce
tinted
patterns
with
which
the
objects
of
nature
might
be
compared
and
according
to
which
they
were
to
receive
their
designations
but
after
all
the
terminology
of
colours
which
has
been
introduced
in
mineralogy
is
open
to
many
objections
the
terms
for
instance
have
not
been
borrowed
from
the
mineral
kingdom
as
was
possible
enough
in
most
cases
but
from
all
kinds
of
visible
objects
too
many
specific
terms
have
been
adopted
and
in
seeking
to
establish
new
definitions
by
combining
these
the
nomenclators
have
not
reflected
that
they
thus
altogether
efface
the
image
from
the
imagination
and
the
idea
from
the
understanding
lastly
these
individual
designations
of
colours
employed
to
a
certain
extent
as
elementary
definitions
are
not
arranged
in
the
best
manner
as
regards
their
respective
derivation
from
each
other
hence
the
scholar
must
learn
every
single
designation
and
impress
an
almost
lifeless
but
positive
language
on
his
memory
the
further
consideration
of
this
would
be
too
foreign
to
our
present
subject
these
remarks
have
reference
to
the
german
mineralogical
t
li
plants
the
colours
of
organic
bodies
in
general
may
be
considered
as
a
higher
kind
of
chemical
operation
for
which
reason
the
ancients
employed
the
word
concoction
πέψις
to
designate
the
process
all
the
elementary
colours
as
well
as
the
combined
and
secondary
hues
appear
on
the
surface
of
organic
productions
while
on
the
other
hand
the
interior
if
not
colourless
appears
strictly
speaking
negative
when
brought
to
the
light
as
we
propose
to
communicate
our
views
respecting
organic
nature
to
a
certain
extent
in
another
place
we
only
insert
here
what
has
been
before
connected
with
the
doctrine
of
colours
while
it
may
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
further
consideration
of
the
views
alluded
to
and
first
of
plants
seeds
bulbs
roots
and
what
is
generally
shut
out
from
the
light
or
immediately
surrounded
by
the
earth
appear
for
the
most
part
white
plants
reared
from
seed
in
darkness
are
white
or
approaching
to
yellow
light
on
the
other
hand
in
acting
on
their
colours
acts
at
the
same
time
on
their
form
plants
which
grow
in
darkness
make
it
is
true
long
shoots
from
joint
to
joint
but
the
stems
between
two
joints
are
thus
longer
than
they
should
be
no
side
stems
are
produced
and
the
metamorphosis
of
the
plant
does
not
take
place
light
on
the
other
hand
places
it
at
once
in
an
active
state
the
plant
appears
green
and
the
course
of
the
metamorphosis
proceeds
uninterruptedly
to
the
period
of
reproduction
we
know
that
the
leaves
of
the
stem
are
only
preparations
and
of
the
instruments
of
florification
and
fructification
and
accordingly
we
can
already
see
colours
in
the
leaves
of
the
stem
which
as
it
were
announce
the
flower
from
afar
as
is
the
case
in
the
amaranthus
there
are
white
flowers
whose
petals
have
wrought
or
refined
themselves
to
the
greatest
purity
there
are
coloured
ones
in
which
the
elementary
hues
may
be
said
to
fluctuate
to
and
fro
there
are
some
which
in
tending
to
the
higher
state
have
only
partially
emancipated
themselves
from
the
green
of
the
plant
flowers
of
the
same
genus
and
even
of
the
same
kind
are
found
of
all
colours
roses
and
particularly
mallows
for
example
vary
through
a
great
portion
of
the
colorific
circle
from
white
to
yellow
then
through
to
bright
red
and
from
thence
to
the
darkest
hue
it
can
exhibit
as
it
approaches
blue
others
already
begin
from
a
higher
degree
in
the
scale
as
for
example
the
poppy
which
is
in
the
first
instance
and
which
afterwards
approaches
a
violet
hue
yet
the
same
colours
in
species
varieties
and
even
in
families
and
classes
if
not
constant
are
still
predominant
especially
the
yellow
colour
blue
is
throughout
rarer
a
process
somewhat
similar
takes
place
in
the
juicy
capsule
of
the
fruit
for
it
increases
in
colour
from
the
green
through
the
yellowish
and
yellow
up
to
the
highest
red
the
colour
of
the
rind
thus
indicating
the
degree
of
ripeness
some
are
coloured
all
round
some
only
on
the
sunny
side
in
which
last
case
the
augmentation
of
the
yellow
into
red
the
gradations
crowding
in
and
upon
each
other
may
be
very
well
observed
many
fruits
too
are
coloured
internally
pure
red
juices
especially
are
common
the
colour
which
is
found
superficially
in
the
flower
and
penetratingly
in
the
fruit
spreads
itself
through
all
the
remaining
parts
colouring
the
roots
and
the
juices
of
the
stem
and
this
with
a
very
rich
and
powerful
hue
so
again
the
colour
of
the
wood
passes
from
yellow
through
the
different
degrees
of
red
up
to
pure
red
and
on
to
brown
blue
woods
are
unknown
to
me
and
thus
in
this
degree
of
organisation
the
active
side
exhibits
itself
powerfully
although
both
principles
appear
balanced
in
the
general
green
of
the
plant
we
have
seen
above
that
the
germ
pushing
from
the
earth
is
generally
white
and
yellowish
but
that
by
means
of
the
action
of
light
and
air
it
acquires
a
green
colour
the
same
happens
with
young
leaves
of
trees
as
may
be
seen
for
example
in
the
birch
the
young
leaves
of
which
are
yellowish
and
if
boiled
yield
a
beautiful
yellow
juice
afterwards
they
become
greener
while
the
leaves
of
other
trees
become
gradually
thus
a
yellow
ingredient
appears
to
belong
more
essentially
to
leaves
than
a
blue
one
for
this
last
vanishes
in
the
autumn
and
the
yellow
of
the
leaf
appears
changed
to
a
brown
colour
still
more
remarkable
however
are
the
particular
cases
where
leaves
in
autumn
again
become
pure
yellow
and
others
increase
to
the
brightest
red
other
plants
again
may
by
artificial
treatment
be
entirely
converted
to
a
colouring
matter
which
is
as
fine
active
and
infinitely
divisible
as
any
other
indigo
and
madder
with
which
so
much
is
effected
are
examples
lichens
are
also
used
for
dyes
to
this
fact
another
stands
immediately
opposed
we
can
namely
extract
the
colouring
part
of
plants
and
as
it
were
exhibit
it
apart
while
the
organisation
does
not
on
this
account
appear
to
suffer
at
all
the
colours
of
flowers
may
be
extracted
by
spirits
of
wine
and
tinge
it
the
petals
meanwhile
becoming
white
there
are
various
modes
of
acting
on
flowers
and
their
juices
by
this
has
been
done
by
boyle
in
many
experiments
roses
are
bleached
by
sulphur
and
may
be
restored
to
their
first
state
by
other
acids
roses
are
turned
green
by
the
smoke
of
tobacco
lii
worms
insects
fishes
with
regard
to
creatures
belonging
to
the
lower
degrees
of
organisation
we
may
first
observe
that
worms
which
live
in
the
earth
and
remain
in
darkness
and
cold
moisture
are
imperfectly
negatively
coloured
worms
bred
in
warm
moisture
and
darkness
are
colourless
light
seems
expressly
necessary
to
the
definite
exhibition
of
colour
creatures
which
live
in
water
which
although
a
very
dense
medium
suffers
sufficient
light
to
pass
through
it
appear
more
or
less
coloured
zoophytes
which
appear
to
animate
the
purest
calcareous
earth
are
mostly
white
yet
we
find
corals
deepened
into
the
most
beautiful
in
other
cells
of
worms
this
colour
increases
nearly
to
bright
red
the
shells
of
the
crustaceous
tribe
are
beautifully
designed
and
coloured
yet
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
neither
nor
the
shells
of
crustacea
of
fresh
water
are
adorned
with
such
bright
colours
as
those
of
the
sea
in
examining
shells
particularly
such
as
are
spiral
we
find
that
a
series
of
animal
organs
similar
to
each
other
must
have
moved
increasingly
forward
and
in
turning
on
an
axis
produced
the
shell
in
a
series
of
chambers
divisions
tubes
and
prominences
according
to
a
plan
for
ever
growing
larger
we
remark
however
that
a
tinging
juice
must
have
accompanied
the
development
of
these
organs
a
juice
which
marked
the
surface
of
the
shell
probably
through
the
immediate
of
the
with
coloured
lines
points
spots
and
shadings
this
must
have
taken
place
at
regular
intervals
and
thus
left
the
indications
of
increasing
growth
lastingly
on
the
exterior
meanwhile
the
interior
is
generally
found
white
or
only
faintly
coloured
that
such
a
juice
is
to
be
found
in
is
besides
sufficiently
proved
by
experience
for
the
creatures
furnish
it
in
its
liquid
and
colouring
state
the
juice
of
the
is
an
example
but
a
much
stronger
is
exhibited
in
the
red
juice
found
in
many
which
was
so
famous
in
ancient
times
and
has
been
employed
with
advantage
by
the
moderns
there
is
it
appears
in
the
entrails
of
many
of
the
crustaceous
tribe
a
certain
vessel
which
is
filled
with
a
red
juice
this
contains
a
very
strong
and
durable
colouring
substance
so
much
so
that
the
entire
creature
may
be
crushed
and
boiled
and
yet
out
of
this
broth
a
sufficiently
strong
tinging
liquid
may
be
extracted
but
the
little
vessel
filled
with
colour
may
be
separated
from
the
animal
by
which
means
of
course
a
concentrated
juice
is
gained
this
juice
has
the
property
that
when
exposed
to
light
and
air
it
appears
first
yellowish
then
greenish
it
then
passes
to
blue
then
to
a
violet
gradually
growing
redder
and
lastly
by
the
action
of
the
sun
and
especially
if
transferred
to
cambric
it
assumes
a
pure
bright
red
colour
thus
we
should
here
have
an
augmentation
even
to
culmination
on
the
side
which
we
can
not
easily
meet
with
in
inorganic
cases
indeed
we
might
almost
call
this
example
a
passage
through
the
whole
scale
and
we
are
persuaded
that
by
due
experiments
the
entire
revolution
of
the
circle
might
really
be
effected
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
by
acids
duly
employed
the
pure
red
may
be
pushed
beyond
the
culminating
point
towards
scarlet
this
juice
appears
on
the
one
hand
to
be
connected
with
the
phenomena
of
reproduction
eggs
being
found
the
embryos
of
future
which
contain
a
similar
colouring
principle
on
the
other
hand
in
animals
ranking
higher
in
the
scale
of
being
the
secretion
appears
to
bear
some
relation
to
the
development
of
the
blood
the
blood
exhibits
similar
properties
in
regard
to
colour
in
its
thinnest
state
it
appears
yellow
thickened
as
it
is
found
in
the
veins
it
appears
red
while
the
arterial
blood
exhibits
a
brighter
red
probably
owing
to
the
oxydation
which
takes
place
by
means
of
breathing
the
venous
blood
approaches
more
to
violet
and
by
this
mutability
denotes
the
tendency
to
that
augmentation
and
progression
which
are
now
familiar
to
us
before
we
quit
the
element
whence
we
derived
the
foregoing
examples
we
may
add
a
few
observations
on
fishes
whose
scaly
surface
is
coloured
either
altogether
in
stripes
or
in
spots
and
still
oftener
exhibits
a
certain
iridescent
appearance
indicating
the
affinity
of
the
scales
with
the
coats
of
and
even
the
pearl
itself
at
the
same
time
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
warmer
climates
the
influence
of
which
extends
to
the
watery
regions
produce
embellish
and
enhance
these
colours
in
fishes
in
a
still
greater
degree
in
otaheite
forster
observed
fishes
with
beautifully
iridescent
surfaces
and
this
effect
was
especially
apparent
at
the
moment
when
the
fish
died
we
may
here
call
to
mind
the
hues
of
the
chameleon
and
other
similar
appearances
for
when
similar
facts
are
presented
together
we
are
better
enabled
to
trace
them
lastly
although
not
strictly
in
the
same
class
the
iridescent
appearance
of
certain
molluscæ
may
be
mentioned
as
well
as
the
phosphorescence
which
in
some
marine
creatures
it
is
said
becomes
iridescent
just
before
it
vanishes
we
now
turn
our
attention
to
those
creatures
which
belong
to
light
air
and
dry
warmth
and
it
is
here
that
we
first
find
ourselves
in
the
living
region
of
colours
here
in
exquisitely
organised
parts
the
elementary
colours
present
themselves
in
their
greatest
purity
and
beauty
they
indicate
however
that
the
creatures
they
adorn
are
still
low
in
the
scale
of
organisation
precisely
because
these
colours
can
thus
appear
as
it
were
unwrought
here
too
heat
seems
to
contribute
much
to
their
development
we
find
insects
which
may
be
considered
altogether
as
concentrated
colouring
matter
among
these
the
cochineals
especially
are
celebrated
with
regard
to
these
we
observe
that
their
mode
of
settling
on
vegetables
and
even
nestling
in
them
at
the
same
time
produces
those
excrescences
which
are
so
useful
as
mordants
in
fixing
colours
but
the
power
of
colour
accompanied
by
regular
organisation
exhibits
itself
in
the
most
striking
manner
in
those
insects
which
require
a
perfect
metamorphosis
for
their
development
in
scarabæ
and
especially
in
butterflies
these
last
which
might
be
called
true
productions
of
light
and
air
often
exhibit
the
most
beautiful
colours
even
in
their
chrysalis
state
indicating
the
future
colours
of
the
butterfly
a
consideration
which
if
pursued
further
hereafter
must
undoubtedly
afford
a
satisfactory
insight
into
many
a
secret
of
organised
being
if
again
we
examine
the
wings
of
the
butterfly
more
accurately
and
in
its
web
discover
the
rudiments
of
an
arm
and
observe
further
the
mode
in
which
this
as
it
were
flattened
arm
is
covered
with
tender
plumage
and
constituted
an
organ
of
flying
we
believe
we
recognise
a
law
according
to
which
the
great
variety
of
tints
is
regulated
this
will
be
a
subject
for
further
investigation
hereafter
that
again
heat
generally
has
an
influence
on
the
size
of
the
creature
on
the
accomplishment
of
the
form
and
on
the
greater
beauty
of
the
colours
hardly
needs
to
be
remarked
liii
birds
the
more
we
approach
the
higher
organisations
the
more
it
becomes
necessary
to
limit
ourselves
to
a
few
passing
observations
for
all
the
natural
conditions
of
such
organised
beings
are
the
result
of
so
many
premises
that
without
having
at
least
hinted
at
these
our
remarks
would
only
appear
daring
and
at
the
same
time
insufficient
we
find
in
plants
that
the
consummate
flower
and
fruit
are
as
it
were
rooted
in
the
stem
and
that
they
are
nourished
by
more
perfect
juices
than
the
original
roots
first
afforded
we
remark
too
that
parasitical
plants
which
derive
their
support
from
organised
structures
exhibit
themselves
especially
endowed
as
to
their
energies
and
qualities
we
might
in
some
sense
compare
the
feathers
of
birds
with
plants
of
this
description
the
feathers
spring
up
as
a
last
structural
result
from
the
surface
of
a
body
which
has
yet
much
in
reserve
for
the
completion
of
the
external
economy
and
thus
are
very
richly
endowed
organs
the
quills
not
only
grow
proportionally
to
a
considerable
size
but
are
throughout
branched
by
which
means
they
properly
become
feathers
and
many
of
these
feathered
branches
are
again
subdivided
thus
again
recalling
the
structure
of
plants
the
feathers
are
very
different
in
shape
and
size
but
each
still
remains
the
same
organ
forming
and
transforming
itself
according
to
the
constitution
of
the
part
of
the
body
from
which
it
springs
with
the
form
the
colour
also
becomes
changed
and
a
certain
law
regulates
the
general
order
of
hues
as
well
as
that
particular
distribution
by
which
a
single
feather
becomes
party
coloured
it
is
from
this
that
all
combination
of
variegated
plumage
arises
and
whence
at
last
the
eyes
in
the
peacock
tail
are
produced
it
is
a
result
similar
to
that
which
we
have
already
unfolded
in
treating
of
the
metamorphosis
of
plants
and
which
we
shall
take
an
early
opportunity
to
prove
although
time
and
circumstances
compel
us
here
to
pass
by
this
organic
law
yet
we
are
bound
to
refer
to
the
chemical
operations
which
commonly
exhibit
themselves
in
the
tinting
of
feathers
in
a
mode
now
sufficiently
known
to
us
plumage
is
of
all
colours
yet
on
the
whole
yellow
deepening
to
red
is
commoner
than
blue
the
operation
of
light
on
the
feathers
and
their
colours
is
to
be
remarked
in
all
cases
thus
for
example
the
feathers
on
the
breast
of
certain
parrots
are
strictly
yellow
the
anterior
portion
which
is
acted
on
by
the
light
is
deepened
from
yellow
to
red
the
breast
of
such
a
bird
appears
but
if
we
blow
into
the
feathers
the
yellow
appears
the
exposed
portion
of
the
feathers
is
in
all
cases
very
different
from
that
which
in
a
quiet
state
is
covered
it
is
only
the
exposed
portion
for
instance
in
ravens
which
exhibits
the
iridescent
appearance
the
covered
portion
does
not
from
which
indication
the
feathers
of
the
tail
when
ruffled
together
may
be
at
once
placed
in
the
natural
order
again
liv
mammalia
and
human
beings
here
the
elementary
colours
begin
to
leave
us
altogether
we
are
arrived
at
the
highest
degree
of
the
scale
and
shall
not
dwell
on
its
characteristics
long
an
animal
of
this
class
is
distinguished
among
the
examples
of
organised
being
every
thing
that
exhibits
itself
about
him
is
living
of
the
internal
structure
we
do
not
speak
but
confine
ourselves
briefly
to
the
surface
the
hairs
are
already
distinguished
from
feathers
inasmuch
as
they
belong
more
to
the
skin
inasmuch
as
they
are
simple
not
branched
they
are
however
like
feathers
shorter
longer
softer
and
firmer
colourless
or
coloured
and
all
this
in
conformity
to
laws
which
might
be
defined
white
and
black
yellow
and
brown
alternate
in
various
modifications
but
they
never
appear
in
such
a
state
as
to
remind
us
of
the
elementary
hues
on
the
contrary
they
are
all
broken
colours
subdued
by
organic
concoction
and
thus
denote
more
or
less
the
perfection
of
life
in
the
being
they
belong
to
one
of
the
most
important
considerations
connected
with
morphology
so
far
as
it
relates
to
surfaces
is
this
that
even
in
quadrupeds
the
spots
of
the
skin
have
a
relation
with
the
parts
underneath
them
capriciously
as
nature
here
appears
on
a
hasty
examination
to
operate
she
nevertheless
consistently
observes
a
secret
law
the
development
and
application
of
this
it
is
true
are
reserved
only
for
accurate
and
careful
investigation
and
sincere
if
in
some
animals
portions
appear
variegated
with
positive
colours
this
of
itself
shows
how
far
such
creatures
are
removed
from
a
perfect
organisation
for
it
may
be
said
the
nobler
a
creature
is
the
more
all
the
mere
material
of
which
he
is
composed
is
disguised
by
being
wrought
together
the
more
essentially
his
surface
corresponds
with
the
internal
organisation
the
less
can
it
exhibit
the
elementary
colours
where
all
tends
to
make
up
a
perfect
whole
any
detached
specific
developments
can
not
take
place
of
man
we
have
little
to
say
for
he
is
entirely
distinct
from
the
general
physiological
results
of
which
we
now
treat
so
much
in
this
case
is
in
affinity
with
the
internal
structure
that
the
surface
can
only
be
sparingly
endowed
when
we
consider
that
brutes
are
rather
encumbered
than
advantageously
provided
with
intercutaneous
muscles
when
we
see
that
much
that
is
superfluous
tends
to
the
surface
as
for
instance
large
ears
and
tails
as
well
as
hair
manes
tufts
we
see
that
nature
in
such
cases
had
much
to
give
away
and
to
lavish
on
the
contrary
the
general
surface
of
the
human
form
is
smooth
and
clean
and
thus
in
the
most
perfect
examples
the
beautiful
forms
are
apparent
for
it
may
be
remarked
in
passing
that
a
superfluity
of
hair
on
the
chest
arms
and
lower
limbs
rather
indicates
weakness
than
strength
poets
only
have
sometimes
been
induced
probably
by
the
example
of
the
ferine
nature
so
strong
in
other
respects
to
extol
similar
attributes
in
their
rough
heroes
but
we
have
here
chiefly
to
speak
of
colour
and
observe
that
the
colour
of
the
human
skin
in
all
its
varieties
is
never
an
elementary
colour
but
presents
by
means
of
organic
concoction
a
highly
complicated
note
x
that
the
colour
of
the
skin
and
hair
has
relation
with
the
differences
of
character
is
beyond
question
and
we
are
led
to
conjecture
that
the
circumstance
of
one
or
other
organic
system
predominating
produces
the
varieties
we
see
a
similar
hypothesis
may
be
applied
to
nations
in
which
case
it
might
perhaps
be
observed
that
certain
colours
correspond
with
certain
confirmations
which
has
always
been
observed
of
the
negro
physiognomy
lastly
we
might
here
consider
the
problematical
question
whether
all
human
forms
and
hues
are
not
equally
beautiful
and
whether
custom
and
are
not
the
causes
why
one
is
preferred
to
another
we
venture
however
after
what
has
been
adduced
to
assert
that
the
white
man
that
is
he
whose
surface
varies
from
white
to
reddish
yellowish
brownish
in
short
whose
surface
appears
most
neutral
in
hue
and
least
inclines
to
any
particular
or
positive
colour
is
the
most
beautiful
on
the
same
principle
a
similar
point
of
perfection
in
human
conformation
may
be
defined
hereafter
when
the
question
relates
to
form
we
do
not
imagine
that
this
question
is
to
be
thus
once
for
all
settled
for
there
are
persons
enough
who
have
reason
to
leave
this
significancy
of
the
exterior
in
doubt
but
we
thus
express
a
conclusion
derived
from
observation
and
reflection
such
as
might
suggest
itself
to
a
mind
aiming
at
a
satisfactory
decision
we
subjoin
a
few
observations
connected
with
the
elementary
chemical
doctrine
of
note
lv
physical
and
chemical
effects
of
the
transmission
of
light
through
coloured
mediums
the
physical
and
chemical
effects
of
colourless
light
are
known
so
that
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
describe
them
at
length
colourless
light
exhibits
itself
under
various
conditions
as
exciting
warmth
as
imparting
a
luminous
quality
to
certain
bodies
as
promoting
oxydation
and
in
the
modes
and
degrees
of
these
effects
many
varieties
take
place
but
no
difference
is
found
indicating
a
principle
of
contrast
such
as
we
find
in
the
transmission
of
coloured
light
we
proceed
briefly
to
advert
to
this
let
the
temperature
of
a
dark
room
be
observed
by
means
of
a
very
sensible
if
the
bulb
is
then
brought
to
the
direct
sun
light
as
it
shines
into
the
room
nothing
is
more
natural
than
that
the
fluid
should
indicate
a
much
higher
degree
of
warmth
if
upon
this
we
interpose
coloured
glasses
it
follows
again
quite
naturally
that
the
degree
of
warmth
must
be
lowered
first
because
the
operation
of
the
direct
light
is
already
somewhat
impeded
by
the
glass
and
again
more
especially
because
a
coloured
glass
as
a
dark
medium
admits
less
light
through
it
but
here
a
difference
in
the
excitation
of
warmth
exhibits
itself
to
the
attentive
observer
according
to
the
colour
of
the
glass
the
yellow
and
the
glasses
produce
a
higher
temperature
than
the
blue
and
the
difference
being
considerable
this
experiment
may
be
made
with
the
prismatic
spectrum
the
temperature
of
the
room
being
first
remarked
on
the
thermometer
the
blue
coloured
light
is
made
to
fall
on
the
bulb
when
a
somewhat
higher
degree
of
warmth
is
exhibited
which
still
increases
as
the
other
colours
are
gradually
brought
to
act
on
the
mercury
if
the
experiment
is
made
with
the
so
that
the
white
light
can
be
retained
in
the
centre
this
refracted
indeed
but
not
yet
coloured
light
is
the
warmest
the
other
colours
stand
in
relation
to
each
other
as
before
as
we
here
merely
describe
without
undertaking
to
deduce
or
explain
this
phenomenon
we
only
remark
in
passing
that
the
pure
light
is
by
no
means
abruptly
and
entirely
at
an
end
with
the
red
division
in
the
spectrum
but
that
a
refracted
light
is
still
to
be
observed
deviating
from
its
course
and
as
it
were
insinuating
itself
beyond
the
prismatic
image
so
that
on
closer
examination
it
will
hardly
be
found
necessary
to
take
refuge
in
invisible
rays
and
their
refraction
the
communication
of
light
by
means
of
coloured
mediums
exhibits
the
same
difference
the
light
communicates
itself
to
bologna
phosphorus
through
blue
and
violet
glasses
but
by
no
means
through
yellow
and
glasses
it
has
been
even
remarked
that
the
phosphori
which
have
been
rendered
luminous
under
violet
and
blue
glasses
become
sooner
extinguished
when
afterwards
placed
under
yellow
and
glasses
than
those
which
have
been
suffered
to
remain
in
a
dark
room
without
any
further
influence
these
experiments
like
the
foregoing
may
also
be
made
by
means
of
the
prismatic
spectrum
when
the
same
results
take
place
to
ascertain
the
effect
of
coloured
light
on
oxydation
and
the
following
means
may
be
employed
let
moist
perfectly
white
muriate
of
silver
be
spread
on
a
strip
of
paper
place
it
in
the
light
so
that
it
may
become
to
a
certain
degree
grey
and
then
cut
it
in
three
portions
of
these
one
may
be
preserved
in
a
book
as
a
specimen
of
this
state
let
another
be
placed
under
a
and
the
third
under
a
glass
the
last
will
become
a
darker
grey
and
exhibit
a
the
other
under
the
glass
will
on
the
contrary
become
a
lighter
grey
and
thus
approach
nearer
to
the
original
state
of
more
perfect
oxydation
the
change
in
both
may
be
ascertained
by
a
comparison
with
the
unaltered
specimen
an
excellent
apparatus
has
been
contrived
to
perform
these
experiments
with
the
prismatic
image
the
results
are
analogous
to
those
already
mentioned
and
we
shall
hereafter
give
the
particulars
making
use
of
the
labours
of
an
accurate
observer
who
has
been
for
some
time
carefully
prosecuting
these
experiments
now
generally
called
chloride
of
silver
the
term
in
the
original
is
t
the
individual
alluded
to
was
seebeck
the
result
of
his
experiments
was
published
in
the
second
t
lvi
chemical
effect
in
dioptrical
achromatism
we
first
invite
our
readers
to
turn
to
what
has
been
before
observed
on
this
subject
to
avoid
unnecessary
repetition
here
we
can
thus
give
a
glass
the
property
of
producing
much
wider
coloured
edges
without
refracting
more
strongly
than
before
that
is
without
displacing
the
object
much
more
perceptibly
this
property
is
communicated
to
the
glass
by
means
of
metallic
oxydes
minium
melted
and
thoroughly
united
with
a
pure
glass
produces
this
effect
and
thus
is
prepared
with
oxyde
of
lead
experiments
of
this
kind
have
been
carried
farther
and
the
butter
of
antimony
which
according
to
a
new
preparation
may
be
exhibited
as
a
pure
fluid
has
been
made
use
of
in
hollow
lenses
and
prisms
producing
a
very
strong
appearance
of
colour
with
a
very
moderate
refraction
and
presenting
the
effect
which
we
have
called
hyperchromatism
in
a
very
vivid
manner
in
common
glass
the
alkaline
nature
obviously
preponderates
since
it
is
chiefly
composed
of
sand
and
alkaline
salts
hence
a
series
of
experiments
exhibiting
the
relation
of
perfectly
alkaline
fluids
to
perfect
acids
might
lead
to
useful
results
for
could
the
maximum
and
minimum
be
found
it
would
be
a
question
whether
a
refracting
medium
could
not
be
discovered
in
which
the
increasing
and
diminishing
appearance
of
colour
an
effect
almost
independent
of
refraction
could
not
be
done
away
with
altogether
while
the
displacement
of
the
object
would
be
unaltered
how
desirable
therefore
it
would
be
with
regard
to
this
last
point
as
well
as
for
the
elucidation
of
the
whole
of
this
third
division
of
our
work
and
indeed
for
the
elucidation
of
the
doctrine
of
colours
generally
that
those
who
are
occupied
in
chemical
researches
with
new
views
ever
opening
to
them
should
take
this
subject
in
hand
pursuing
into
more
delicate
combinations
what
we
have
only
roughly
hinted
at
and
prosecuting
their
inquiries
with
reference
to
science
as
a
whole
part
iv
general
characteristics
we
have
hitherto
in
a
manner
forcibly
kept
phenomena
asunder
which
partly
from
their
nature
partly
in
accordance
with
our
mental
habits
have
as
it
were
constantly
sought
to
be
reunited
we
have
exhibited
them
in
three
divisions
we
have
considered
colours
first
as
transient
the
result
of
an
action
and
in
the
eye
itself
next
as
passing
effects
of
colourless
transparent
or
opaque
mediums
on
light
especially
on
the
luminous
image
lastly
we
arrived
at
the
point
where
we
could
securely
pronounce
them
as
permanent
and
actually
inherent
in
bodies
in
following
this
order
we
have
as
far
as
possible
endeavoured
to
define
to
separate
and
to
class
the
appearances
but
now
that
we
need
no
longer
be
apprehensive
of
mixing
or
confounding
them
we
may
proceed
first
to
state
the
general
nature
of
these
appearances
considered
abstractedly
as
an
independent
circle
of
facts
and
in
the
next
place
to
show
how
this
particular
circle
is
connected
with
other
classes
of
analogous
phenomena
in
nature
the
facility
with
which
colour
appears
we
have
observed
that
colour
under
many
conditions
appears
very
easily
the
susceptibility
of
the
eye
with
regard
to
light
the
constant
of
the
retina
against
it
produce
instantaneously
a
slight
iridescence
every
subdued
light
may
be
considered
as
coloured
nay
we
ought
to
call
any
light
coloured
inasmuch
as
it
is
seen
colourless
light
colourless
surfaces
are
in
some
sort
abstract
ideas
in
actual
experience
we
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
aware
of
note
z
if
light
impinges
on
a
colourless
body
is
reflected
from
it
or
passes
through
it
colour
immediately
appears
but
it
is
necessary
here
to
remember
what
has
been
so
often
urged
by
us
namely
that
the
leading
conditions
of
refraction
reflection
are
not
of
themselves
sufficient
to
produce
the
appearance
sometimes
it
is
true
light
acts
with
these
merely
as
light
but
oftener
as
a
defined
circumscribed
appearance
as
a
luminous
image
the
of
the
medium
is
often
a
necessary
condition
while
half
and
double
shadows
are
required
for
many
coloured
appearances
in
all
cases
however
colour
appears
instantaneously
we
find
again
that
by
means
of
pressure
breathing
heat
by
various
kinds
of
motion
and
alteration
on
smooth
clean
surfaces
as
well
as
on
colourless
fluids
colour
is
immediately
produced
the
slightest
change
has
only
to
take
place
in
the
component
parts
of
bodies
whether
by
immixture
with
other
particles
or
other
such
effects
and
colour
either
makes
its
appearance
or
becomes
changed
the
force
of
colour
the
physical
colours
and
especially
those
of
the
prism
were
formerly
called
on
account
of
their
extraordinary
beauty
and
force
strictly
speaking
however
a
high
degree
of
effect
may
be
ascribed
to
all
appearances
of
colour
assuming
that
they
are
exhibited
under
the
purest
and
most
perfect
conditions
the
dark
nature
of
colour
its
full
rich
quality
is
what
produces
the
grave
and
at
the
same
time
fascinating
impression
we
sometimes
experience
and
as
colour
is
to
be
considered
a
condition
of
light
so
it
can
not
dispense
with
light
as
the
cause
of
its
appearance
as
its
basis
or
ground
as
a
power
thus
displaying
and
manifesting
colour
the
definite
nature
of
colour
the
existence
and
the
relatively
definite
character
of
colour
are
one
and
the
same
thing
light
displays
itself
and
the
face
of
nature
as
it
were
with
a
general
indifference
informing
us
as
to
surrounding
objects
perhaps
devoid
of
interest
or
importance
but
colour
is
at
all
times
specific
characteristic
significant
considered
in
a
general
point
of
view
colour
is
determined
towards
one
of
two
sides
it
thus
presents
a
contrast
which
we
call
a
polarity
and
which
we
may
fitly
designate
by
the
expressions
and
yellow
blue
action
negation
light
shadow
brightness
darkness
force
weakness
warmth
coldness
proximity
distance
repulsion
attraction
affinity
with
acids
affinity
with
alkalis
combination
of
the
two
principles
if
these
specific
contrasted
principles
are
combined
the
respective
qualities
do
not
therefore
destroy
each
other
for
if
in
this
intermixture
the
ingredients
are
so
perfectly
balanced
that
neither
is
to
be
distinctly
recognised
the
union
again
acquires
a
specific
character
it
appears
as
a
quality
by
itself
in
which
we
no
longer
think
of
combination
this
union
we
call
green
thus
if
two
opposite
phenomena
springing
from
the
same
source
do
not
destroy
each
other
when
combined
but
in
their
union
present
a
third
appreciable
and
pleasing
appearance
this
result
at
once
indicates
their
harmonious
relation
the
more
perfect
result
yet
remains
to
be
adverted
to
augmentation
to
red
blue
and
yellow
do
not
admit
of
increased
intensity
without
presently
exhibiting
a
new
appearance
in
addition
to
their
own
each
colour
in
its
lightest
state
is
a
dark
if
condensed
it
must
become
darker
but
this
effect
no
sooner
takes
place
than
the
hue
assumes
an
appearance
which
we
designate
by
the
word
reddish
this
appearance
still
increases
so
that
when
the
highest
degree
of
intensity
is
attained
it
predominates
over
the
original
hue
a
powerful
impression
of
light
leaves
the
sensation
of
red
on
the
retina
in
the
prismatic
which
springs
directly
from
the
yellow
we
hardly
recognise
the
yellow
this
deepening
takes
place
again
by
means
of
colourless
mediums
and
here
we
see
the
effect
in
its
utmost
purity
and
extent
transparent
fluids
coloured
with
any
given
hues
in
a
series
of
exhibit
it
very
strikingly
the
augmentation
is
unremittingly
rapid
and
constant
it
is
universal
and
obtains
in
physiological
as
well
as
in
physical
and
chemical
colours
junction
of
the
two
augmented
extremes
as
the
extremes
of
the
simple
contrast
produce
a
beautiful
and
agreeable
appearance
by
their
union
so
the
deepened
extremes
on
being
united
will
present
a
still
more
fascinating
colour
indeed
it
might
naturally
be
expected
that
we
should
here
find
the
acme
of
the
whole
phenomenon
completeness
the
result
of
variety
and
such
is
the
fact
for
pure
red
appears
a
colour
to
which
from
its
excellence
we
have
appropriated
the
term
purpur
there
are
various
modes
in
which
pure
red
may
appear
by
bringing
together
the
violet
edge
and
border
in
prismatic
experiments
by
continued
augmentation
in
chemical
operations
and
by
the
organic
contrast
in
physiological
effects
as
a
pigment
it
can
not
be
produced
by
intermixture
or
union
but
only
by
arresting
the
hue
in
substances
chemically
acted
on
at
the
high
culminating
point
hence
the
painter
is
justified
in
assuming
that
there
are
primitive
colours
from
which
he
combines
all
the
others
the
natural
philosopher
on
the
other
hand
assumes
only
elementary
colours
from
which
he
in
like
manner
developes
and
combines
the
rest
completeness
the
result
of
variety
in
colour
the
various
appearances
of
colour
arrested
in
their
different
degrees
and
seen
in
juxtaposition
produce
a
whole
this
totality
is
harmony
to
the
eye
the
chromatic
circle
has
been
gradually
presented
to
us
the
various
relations
of
its
progression
are
apparent
to
us
two
pure
original
principles
in
contrast
are
the
foundation
of
the
whole
an
augmentation
manifests
itself
by
means
of
which
both
approach
a
third
state
hence
there
exists
on
both
sides
a
lowest
and
highest
a
simplest
and
most
qualified
state
again
two
combinations
present
themselves
first
that
of
the
simple
primitive
contrasts
then
that
of
the
deepened
contrasts
harmony
of
the
complete
state
the
whole
ingredients
of
the
chromatic
scale
seen
in
juxtaposition
produce
an
harmonious
impression
on
the
eye
the
difference
between
the
physical
contrast
and
harmonious
opposition
in
all
its
extent
should
not
be
overlooked
the
first
resides
in
the
pure
restricted
original
dualism
considered
in
its
antagonizing
elements
the
other
results
from
the
fully
developed
effects
of
the
complete
state
every
single
opposition
in
order
to
be
harmonious
must
comprehend
the
whole
the
physiological
experiments
are
sufficiently
convincing
on
this
point
a
development
of
all
the
possible
contrasts
of
the
chromatic
scale
will
be
shortly
given
facility
with
which
colour
may
be
made
to
tend
either
to
the
plus
or
minus
side
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
take
notice
of
the
mutability
of
colour
in
considering
its
augmentation
and
progressive
variations
round
the
whole
circle
but
the
hues
even
pass
and
repass
from
one
side
to
the
other
rapidly
and
of
necessity
physiological
colours
are
different
in
appearance
as
they
happen
to
fall
on
a
dark
or
on
a
light
ground
in
physical
colours
the
combination
of
the
objective
and
subjective
experiments
is
very
remarkable
the
epoptical
colours
it
appears
are
contrasted
according
as
the
light
shines
through
or
upon
them
to
what
extent
the
chemical
colours
may
be
changed
by
fire
and
alkalis
has
been
sufficiently
shown
in
its
proper
place
evanescence
of
colour
all
that
has
been
adverted
to
as
subsequent
to
the
rapid
excitation
and
definition
of
colour
immixture
augmentation
combination
separation
not
forgetting
the
law
of
compensatory
harmony
all
takes
place
with
the
greatest
rapidity
and
facility
but
with
equal
quickness
colour
again
altogether
disappears
the
physiological
appearances
are
in
no
wise
to
be
arrested
the
physical
last
only
as
long
as
the
external
condition
lasts
even
the
chemical
colours
have
great
mutability
they
may
be
made
to
pass
and
repass
from
one
side
to
the
other
by
means
of
opposite
and
may
even
be
annihilated
altogether
permanence
of
colour
the
chemical
colours
afford
evidence
of
very
great
duration
colours
fixed
in
glass
by
fusion
and
by
nature
in
gems
defy
all
time
and
the
art
of
dyeing
again
fixes
colour
very
powerfully
the
hues
of
pigments
which
might
otherwise
be
easily
rendered
mutable
by

be
communicated
to
substances
in
the
greatest
permanency
by

of
mordants

the
last
would
be
more
literally
rendered
the
author
has
already
frequently
made
use
of
the
terms
and
as
equivalent
to
and
t
wherever
this
word
occurs
incidentally
it
is
translated
the
english

generally
employed
to

a
colour

no
diagram
or
table
of
this
kind
was
ever
given
by
the
t
part
relation
to
other
pursuits
relation
to
philosophy
the
investigator
of
nature
can
not
be
required
to
be
a
philosopher
but
it
is
expected
that
he
should
so
far
have
attained
the
habit
of
philosophizing
as
to
distinguish
himself
essentially
from
the
world
in
order
to
associate
himself
with
it
again
in
a
higher
sense
he
should
form
to
himself
a
method
in
accordance
with
observation
but
he
should
take
heed
not
to
reduce
observation
to
mere
notion
to
substitute
words
for
this
notion
and
to
use
and
deal
with
these
words
as
if
they
were
things
he
should
be
acquainted
with
the
labours
of
philosophers
in
order
to
follow
up
the
phenomena
which
have
been
the
subject
of
his
observation
into
the
philosophic
region
it
can
not
be
required
that
the
philosopher
should
be
a
naturalist
and
yet
his
in
physical
researches
is
as
necessary
as
it
is
desirable
he
needs
not
an
acquaintance
with
details
for
this
but
only
a
clear
view
of
those
conclusions
where
insulated
facts
meet
we
have
before
alluded
to
this
important
consideration
and
repeat
it
here
where
it
is
in
its
place
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
physical
science
as
well
as
to
many
other
kinds
of
knowledge
is
that
men
should
treat
a
secondary
phenomenon
as
a
primordial
one
and
since
it
is
impossible
to
derive
the
original
fact
from
the
secondary
state
seek
to
explain
what
is
in
reality
the
cause
by
an
effect
made
to
usurp
its
place
hence
arises
an
endless
confusion
a
mere
verbiage
a
constant
endeavour
to
seek
and
to
find
subterfuges
whenever
truth
presents
itself
and
threatens
to
be
overpowering
while
the
observer
the
investigator
of
nature
is
thus
dissatisfied
in
finding
that
the
appearances
he
sees
still
contradict
a
received
theory
the
philosopher
can
calmly
continue
to
operate
in
his
abstract
department
on
a
false
result
for
no
result
is
so
false
but
that
it
can
be
made
to
appear
valid
as
form
without
substance
by
some
means
or
other
if
on
the
other
hand
the
investigator
of
nature
can
attain
to
the
knowledge
of
that
which
we
have
called
a
primordial
phenomenon
he
is
safe
and
the
philosopher
with
him
the
investigator
of
nature
is
safe
since
he
is
persuaded
that
he
has
here
arrived
at
the
limits
of
his
science
that
he
finds
himself
at
the
height
of
experimental
research
a
height
whence
he
can
look
back
upon
the
details
of
observation
in
all
its
steps
and
forwards
into
if
he
can
not
enter
the
regions
of
theory
the
philosopher
is
safe
for
he
receives
from
the
experimentalist
an
ultimate
fact
which
in
his
hands
now
becomes
an
elementary
one
he
now
justly
pays
little
attention
to
appearances
which
are
understood
to
be
secondary
whether
he
already
finds
them
scientifically
arranged
or
whether
they
present
themselves
to
his
casual
observation
scattered
and
confused
should
he
even
be
inclined
to
go
over
this
experimental
ground
himself
and
not
be
averse
to
examination
in
detail
he
does
this
conveniently
instead
of
lingering
too
long
in
the
consideration
of
secondary
and
intermediate
circumstances
or
hastily
passing
them
over
without
becoming
accurately
acquainted
with
them
to
place
the
doctrine
of
colours
nearer
in
this
sense
within
the
philosopher
reach
was
the
author
wish
and
although
the
execution
of
his
purpose
from
various
causes
does
not
correspond
with
his
intention
he
will
still
keep
this
object
in
view
in
an
intended
recapitulation
as
well
as
in
the
polemical
and
historical
portions
of
his
work
for
he
will
have
to
return
to
the
consideration
of
this
point
hereafter
on
an
occasion
where
it
will
be
necessary
to
speak
with
less
reserve
relation
to
mathematics
it
may
be
expected
that
the
investigator
of
nature
who
proposes
to
treat
the
science
of
natural
philosophy
in
its
entire
range
should
be
a
mathematician
in
the
middle
ages
mathematics
was
the
chief
organ
by
means
of
which
men
hoped
to
master
the
secrets
of
nature
and
even
now
geometry
in
certain
departments
of
physics
is
justly
considered
of
first
importance
the
author
can
boast
of
no
attainments
of
this
kind
and
on
this
account
confines
himself
to
departments
of
science
which
are
independent
of
geometry
departments
which
in
modern
times
have
been
opened
up
far
and
wide
it
will
be
universally
allowed
that
mathematics
one
of
the
noblest
auxiliaries
which
can
be
employed
by
man
has
in
one
point
of
view
been
of
the
greatest
use
to
the
physical
sciences
but
that
by
a
false
application
of
its
methods
it
has
in
many
respects
been
prejudicial
to
them
is
also
not
to
be
denied
we
find
it
here
and
there
reluctantly
admitted
the
theory
of
colours
in
particular
has
suffered
much
and
its
progress
has
been
incalculably
retarded
by
having
been
mixed
up
with
optics
generally
a
science
which
can
not
dispense
with
mathematics
whereas
the
theory
of
colours
in
strictness
may
be
investigated
quite
independently
of
optics
but
besides
this
there
was
an
additional
evil
a
great
mathematician
was
possessed
with
an
entirely
false
notion
on
the
physical
origin
of
colours
yet
owing
to
his
great
authority
as
a
geometer
the
mistakes
which
he
committed
as
an
experimentalist
long
became
sanctioned
in
the
eyes
of
a
world
ever
fettered
in
prejudices
the
author
of
the
present
inquiry
has
endeavoured
throughout
to
keep
the
theory
of
colours
distinct
from
the
mathematics
although
there
are
evidently
certain
points
where
the
assistance
of
geometry
would
be
desirable
had
not
the
unprejudiced
mathematicians
with
whom
he
has
had
or
still
has
the
good
fortune
to
be
acquainted
been
prevented
by
other
occupations
from
making
common
cause
with
him
his
work
would
not
have
wanted
some
merit
in
this
respect
but
this
very
want
may
be
in
the
end
advantageous
since
it
may
now
become
the
object
of
the
enlightened
mathematician
to
ascertain
where
the
doctrine
of
colours
is
in
need
of
his
aid
and
how
he
can
contribute
the
means
at
his
command
with
a
view
to
the
complete
elucidation
of
this
branch
of
physics
in
general
it
were
to
be
wished
that
the
germans
who
render
such
good
service
to
science
while
they
adopt
all
that
is
good
from
other
nations
could
by
degrees
accustom
themselves
to
work
in
concert
we
live
it
must
be
confessed
in
an
age
the
habits
of
which
are
directly
opposed
to
such
a
wish
every
one
seeks
not
only
to
be
original
in
his
views
but
to
be
independent
of
the
labours
of
others
or
at
least
to
persuade
himself
that
he
is
so
even
in
the
course
of
his
life
and
occupation
it
is
very
often
remarked
that
men
who
undoubtedly
have
accomplished
much
quote
themselves
only
their
own
writings
journals
and
compendiums
whereas
it
would
be
far
more
advantageous
for
the
individual
and
for
the
world
if
many
were
devoted
to
a
common
pursuit
the
conduct
of
our
neighbours
the
french
is
in
this
respect
worthy
of
imitation
we
have
a
pleasing
instance
in
cuvier
preface
to
his
tableau
élémentaire
de
naturelle
des
animaux
he
who
has
observed
science
and
its
progress
with
an
unprejudiced
eye
might
even
ask
whether
it
is
desirable
that
so
many
occupations
and
aims
though
allied
to
each
other
should
be
united
in
one
person
and
whether
it
would
not
be
more
suitable
for
the
limited
powers
of
the
human
mind
to
distinguish
for
example
the
investigator
and
inventor
from
him
who
employs
and
applies
the
result
of
experiment
astronomers
who
devote
themselves
to
the
observation
of
the
heavens
and
the
discovery
or
enumeration
of
stars
have
in
modern
times
formed
to
a
certain
extent
a
distinct
class
from
those
who
calculate
the
orbits
consider
the
universe
in
its
connexion
and
more
accurately
define
its
laws
the
history
of
the
doctrine
of
colours
will
often
lead
us
back
to
these
considerations
relation
to
the
technical
operations
of
the
dyer
if
in
our
labours
we
have
gone
out
of
the
province
of
the
mathematician
we
have
on
the
other
hand
endeavoured
to
meet
the
practical
views
of
the
dyer
and
although
the
chapter
which
treats
of
colour
in
a
chemical
point
of
view
is
not
the
most
complete
and
circumstantial
yet
in
that
portion
as
well
as
in
our
general
observations
respecting
colour
the
dyer
will
find
his
views
assisted
far
more
than
by
the
theory
hitherto
in
vogue
which
failed
to
afford
him
any
assistance
it
is
curious
in
this
view
to
take
a
glance
at
the
works
containing
directions
on
the
art
of
dyeing
as
the
catholic
on
entering
his
temple
sprinkles
himself
with
holy
water
and
after
bending
the
knee
proceeds
perhaps
to
converse
with
his
friends
on
his
affairs
without
any
especial
devotion
so
all
the
treatises
on
dyeing
begin
with
a
respectful
allusion
to
the
accredited
theory
without
afterwards
exhibiting
a
single
trace
of
any
principle
deduced
from
this
theory
or
showing
that
it
has
thrown
light
on
any
part
of
the
art
or
that
it
offers
any
useful
hints
in
furtherance
of
practical
methods
on
the
other
hand
there
are
men
who
after
having
become
thoroughly
and
experimentally
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
dyes
have
not
been
able
to
reconcile
their
observations
with
the
received
theory
who
have
in
short
discovered
its
weak
points
and
sought
for
a
general
view
more
consonant
to
nature
and
experience
when
we
come
to
the
names
of
castel
and
gülich
in
our
historical
review
we
shall
have
occasion
to
enter
into
this
more
fully
and
an
opportunity
will
then
present
itself
to
show
that
an
assiduous
experience
in
taking
advantage
of
every
accident
may
in
fact
be
said
almost
to
exhaust
the
knowledge
of
the
province
to
which
it
is
confined
the
high
and
complete
result
is
then
submitted
to
the
theorist
who
if
he
examines
facts
with
accuracy
and
reasons
with
candour
will
find
such
materials
eminently
useful
as
a
basis
for
his
note
a
a
relation
to
physiology
and
pathology
if
the
phenomena
adduced
in
the
chapter
where
colours
were
considered
in
a
physiological
and
pathological
view
are
for
the
most
part
generally
known
still
some
new
views
mixed
up
with
them
will
not
be
unacceptable
to
the
physiologist
we
especially
hope
to
have
given
him
cause
to
be
satisfied
by
classing
certain
phenomena
which
stood
alone
under
analogous
facts
and
thus
in
some
measure
to
have
prepared
the
way
for
his
further
investigations
the
appendix
on
pathological
colours
again
is
admitted
to
be
scanty
and
unconnected
we
reflect
however
that
germany
can
boast
of
men
who
are
not
only
highly
experienced
in
this
department
but
are
likewise
so
distinguished
for
general
cultivation
that
it
can
cost
them
but
little
to
revise
this
portion
to
complete
what
has
been
sketched
and
at
the
same
time
to
connect
it
with
the
higher
facts
of
organisation
relation
to
natural
history
if
we
may
at
all
hope
that
natural
history
will
gradually
be
modified
by
the
principle
of
deducing
the
ordinary
appearances
of
nature
from
higher
phenomena
the
author
believes
he
may
have
given
some
hints
and
introductory
views
bearing
on
this
object
also
as
colour
in
its
infinite
variety
exhibits
itself
on
the
surface
of
living
beings
it
becomes
an
important
part
of
the
outward
indications
by
means
of
which
we
can
discover
what
passes
underneath
in
one
point
of
view
it
is
certainly
not
to
be
too
much
relied
on
on
account
of
its
indefinite
and
mutable
nature
yet
even
this
mutability
inasmuch
as
it
exhibits
itself
as
a
constant
quality
again
becomes
a
criterion
of
a
mutable
vitality
and
the
author
wishes
nothing
more
than
that
time
may
be
granted
him
to
develop
the
results
of
his
observations
on
this
subject
more
fully
here
they
would
not
be
in
their
place
relation
to
general
physics
the
state
in
which
general
physics
now
is
appears
again
particularly
favourable
to
our
labours
for
natural
philosophy
owing
to
indefatigable
and
variously
directed
research
has
gradually
attained
such
eminence
that
it
appears
not
impossible
to
refer
a
boundless
empiricism
to
one
centre
without
referring
to
subjects
which
are
too
far
removed
from
our
own
province
we
observe
that
the
formulæ
under
which
the
elementary
appearances
of
nature
are
expressed
altogether
tend
in
this
direction
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
through
this
correspondence
of
expression
a
correspondence
in
meaning
will
necessarily
be
soon
arrived
at
true
observers
of
nature
however
they
may
differ
in
opinion
in
other
respects
will
agree
that
all
which
presents
itself
as
appearance
all
that
we
meet
with
as
phenomenon
must
either
indicate
an
original
division
which
is
capable
of
union
or
an
original
unity
which
admits
of
division
and
that
the
phenomenon
will
present
itself
accordingly
to
divide
the
united
to
unite
the
divided
is
the
life
of
nature
this
is
the
eternal
systole
and
diastole
the
eternal
collapsion
and
expansion
the
inspiration
and
expiration
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
and
move
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
observe
that
what
we
here
express
as
number
and
restrict
to
dualism
is
to
be
understood
in
a
higher
sense
the
appearance
of
a
third
a
fourth
order
of
facts
progressively
developing
themselves
is
to
be
similarly
understood
but
actual
observation
should
above
all
be
the
basis
of
all
these
expressions
iron
is
known
to
us
as
a
peculiar
substance
different
from
other
substances
in
its
ordinary
state
we
look
upon
it
as
a
mere
material
remarkable
only
on
account
of
its
fitness
for
various
uses
and
applications
how
little
however
is
necessary
to
do
away
with
the
comparative
insignificancy
of
this
substance
a
power
is
called
forth
which
while
it
tends
again
to
a
state
of
union
and
as
it
were
seeks
itself
acquires
a
kind
of
magical
relation
with
its
like
and
propagates
this
double
property
which
is
in
fact
but
a
principle
of
reunion
throughout
all
bodies
of
the
same
kind
we
here
first
observe
the
mere
substance
iron
we
see
the
division
that
takes
place
in
it
propagate
itself
and
disappear
and
again
easily
become
this
according
to
our
mode
of
thinking
is
a
primordial
phenomenon
in
immediate
relation
with
its
idea
and
which
acknowledges
nothing
earthly
beyond
it
electricity
is
again
peculiarly
characterised
as
a
mere
quality
we
are
unacquainted
with
it
for
us
it
is
a
nothing
a
zero
a
mere
point
which
however
dwells
in
all
apparent
existences
and
at
the
same
time
is
the
point
of
origin
whence
on
the
slightest
stimulus
a
double
appearance
presents
itself
an
appearance
which
only
manifests
itself
to
vanish
the
conditions
under
which
this
manifestation
is
excited
are
infinitely
varied
according
to
the
nature
of
particular
bodies
from
the
rudest
mechanical
friction
of
very
different
substances
with
one
another
to
the
mere
contiguity
of
two
entirely
similar
bodies
the
phenomenon
is
present
and
stirring
nay
striking
and
powerful
and
so
decided
and
specific
that
when
we
employ
the
terms
or
formulæ
polarity
plus
and
minus
for
north
and
south
for
glass
and
resin
we
do
so
justifiably
and
in
conformity
with
nature
this
phenomenon
although
it
especially
affects
the
surface
is
yet
by
no
means
superficial
it
influences
the
tendency
or
determination
of
material
qualities
and
connects
itself
in
immediate
with
the
important
double
phenomenon
which
takes
place
so
universally
in
chemistry
oxydation
and
to
introduce
and
include
the
appearances
of
colour
in
this
series
this
circle
of
phenomena
was
the
object
of
our
labours
what
we
have
not
succeeded
in
others
will
accomplish
we
found
a
primordial
vast
contrast
between
light
and
darkness
which
may
be
more
generally
expressed
by
light
and
its
absence
we
looked
for
the
intermediate
state
and
sought
by
means
of
it
to
compose
the
visible
world
of
light
shade
and
colour
in
the
prosecution
of
this
we
employed
various
terms
applicable
to
the
development
of
the
phenomena
terms
which
we
adopted
from
the
theories
of
magnetism
of
electricity
and
of
chemistry
it
was
necessary
however
to
extend
this
terminology
since
we
found
ourselves
in
an
abstract
region
and
had
to
express
more
complicated
relations
if
electricity
and
galvanism
in
their
general
character
are
distinguished
as
superior
to
the
more
limited
exhibition
of
magnetic
phenomena
it
may
be
said
that
colour
although
coming
under
similar
laws
is
still
superior
for
since
it
addresses
itself
to
the
noble
sense
of
vision
its
perfections
are
more
generally
displayed
compare
the
varied
effects
which
result
from
the
augmentation
of
yellow
and
blue
to
red
from
the
combination
of
these
two
higher
extremes
to
pure
red
and
the
union
of
the
two
inferior
extremes
to
green
what
a
far
more
varied
scheme
is
apparent
here
than
that
in
which
magnetism
and
electricity
are
comprehended
these
last
phenomena
may
be
said
to
be
inferior
again
on
another
account
for
though
they
penetrate
and
give
life
to
the
universe
they
can
not
address
themselves
to
man
in
a
higher
sense
in
order
to
his
employing
them
æsthetically
the
general
simple
physical
law
must
first
be
elevated
and
diversified
itself
in
order
to
be
available
for
elevated
uses
if
the
reader
in
this
spirit
recalls
what
has
been
stated
by
us
throughout
generally
and
in
detail
with
regard
to
colour
he
will
himself
pursue
and
unfold
what
has
been
here
only
lightly
hinted
at
he
will
augur
well
for
science
technical
processes
and
art
if
it
should
prove
possible
to
rescue
the
attractive
subject
of
the
doctrine
of
colours
from
the
atomic
restriction
and
isolation
in
which
it
has
been
banished
in
order
to
restore
it
to
the
general
dynamic
flow
of
life
and
action
which
the
present
age
loves
to
recognise
in
nature
these
considerations
will
press
upon
us
more
strongly
when
in
the
historical
portion
we
shall
have
to
speak
of
many
an
enterprising
and
intelligent
man
who
failed
to
possess
his
contemporaries
with
his
convictions
relation
to
the
theory
of
music
before
we
proceed
to
the
moral
associations
of
colour
and
the
æsthetic
influences
arising
from
them
we
have
here
to
say
a
few
words
on
its
relation
to
melody
that
a
certain
relation
exists
between
the
two
has
been
always
felt
this
is
proved
by
the
frequent
comparisons
we
meet
with
sometimes
as
passing
allusions
sometimes
as
circumstantial
parallels
the
error
which
writers
have
fallen
into
in
trying
to
establish
this
analogy
we
would
thus
define
colour
and
sound
do
not
admit
of
being
directly
compared
together
in
any
way
but
both
are
referable
to
a
higher
formula
both
are
derivable
although
each
for
itself
from
this
higher
law
they
are
like
two
rivers
which
have
their
source
in
one
and
the
same
mountain
but
subsequently
pursue
their
way
under
totally
different
conditions
in
two
totally
different
regions
so
that
throughout
the
whole
course
of
both
no
two
points
can
be
compared
both
are
general
elementary
effects
acting
according
to
the
general
law
of
separation
and
tendency
to
union
of
undulation
and
oscillation
yet
acting
thus
in
wholly
different
provinces
in
different
modes
on
different
elementary
mediums
for
different
note
b
b
could
some
investigator
rightly
adopt
the
method
in
which
we
have
connected
the
doctrine
of
colours
with
natural
philosophy
generally
and
happily
supply
what
has
escaped
or
been
missed
by
us
the
theory
of
sound
we
are
persuaded
might
be
perfectly
connected
with
general
physics
at
present
it
stands
as
it
were
isolated
within
the
circle
of
science
it
is
true
it
would
be
an
undertaking
of
the
greatest
difficulty
to
do
away
with
the
positive
character
which
we
are
now
accustomed
to
attribute
to
music
a
character
resulting
from
the
achievements
of
practical
skill
from
accidental
mathematical
æsthetical
influences
and
to
substitute
for
all
this
a
merely
physical
inquiry
tending
to
resolve
the
science
into
its
first
elements
yet
considering
the
point
at
which
science
and
art
are
now
arrived
considering
the
many
excellent
preparatory
investigations
that
have
been
made
relative
to
this
subject
we
may
perhaps
still
see
it
accomplished
concluding
observations
on
terminology
we
never
sufficiently
reflect
that
a
language
strictly
speaking
can
only
be
symbolical
and
figurative
that
it
can
never
express
things
directly
but
only
as
it
were
reflectedly
this
is
especially
the
case
in
speaking
of
qualities
which
are
only
imperfectly
presented
to
observation
which
might
rather
be
called
powers
than
objects
and
which
are
ever
in
movement
throughout
nature
they
are
not
to
be
arrested
and
yet
we
find
it
necessary
to
describe
them
hence
we
look
for
all
kinds
of
formulæ
in
order
figuratively
at
least
to
define
them
metaphysical
formulæ
have
breadth
as
well
as
depth
but
on
this
very
account
they
require
a
corresponding
import
the
danger
here
is
vagueness
mathematical
expressions
may
in
many
cases
be
very
conveniently
and
happily
employed
but
there
is
always
an
inflexibility
in
them
and
we
presently
feel
their
inadequacy
for
even
in
elementary
cases
we
are
very
soon
conscious
of
an
incommensurable
idea
they
are
besides
only
intelligible
to
those
who
are
especially
conversant
in
the
sciences
to
which
such
formulæ
are
appropriated
the
terms
of
the
science
of
mechanics
are
more
addressed
to
the
ordinary
mind
but
they
are
ordinary
in
other
senses
and
always
have
something
unpolished
they
destroy
the
inward
life
to
offer
from
without
an
insufficient
substitute
for
it
the
formulæ
of
the
corpuscular
theories
are
nearly
allied
to
the
last
through
them
the
mutable
becomes
rigid
description
and
expression
uncouth
while
again
moral
terms
which
undoubtedly
can
express
nicer
relations
have
the
effect
of
mere
symbols
in
the
end
and
are
in
danger
of
being
lost
in
a
play
of
wit
if
however
a
writer
could
use
all
these
modes
of
description
and
expression
with
perfect
command
and
thus
give
forth
the
result
of
his
observations
on
the
phenomena
of
nature
in
a
diversified
language
if
he
could
preserve
himself
from
predilections
still
embodying
a
lively
meaning
in
as
animated
an
expression
we
might
look
for
much
instruction
communicated
in
the
most
agreeable
of
forms
yet
how
difficult
it
is
to
avoid
substituting
the
sign
for
the
thing
how
difficult
to
keep
the
essential
quality
still
living
before
us
and
not
to
kill
it
with
the
word
with
all
this
we
are
exposed
in
modern
times
to
a
still
greater
danger
by
adopting
expressions
and
terminologies
from
all
branches
of
knowledge
and
science
to
embody
our
views
of
simple
nature
astronomy
cosmology
geology
natural
history
nay
religion
and
mysticism
are
called
in
in
aid
and
how
often
do
we
not
find
a
general
idea
and
an
elementary
state
rather
hidden
and
obscured
than
elucidated
and
brought
nearer
to
us
by
the
employment
of
terms
the
application
of
which
is
strictly
specific
and
secondary
we
are
quite
aware
of
the
necessity
which
led
to
the
introduction
and
general
adoption
of
such
a
language
we
also
know
that
it
has
become
in
a
certain
sense
indispensable
but
it
is
only
a
moderate
unpretending
recourse
to
it
with
an
internal
conviction
of
its
fitness
that
can
recommend
it
after
all
the
most
desirable
principle
would
be
that
writers
should
borrow
the
expressions
employed
to
describe
the
details
of
a
given
province
of
investigation
from
the
province
itself
treating
the
simplest
phenomenon
as
an
elementary
formula
and
deriving
and
developing
the
more
complicated
designations
from
this
the
necessity
and
suitableness
of
such
a
conventional
language
where
the
elementary
sign
expresses
the
appearance
itself
has
been
duly
appreciated
by
extending
for
instance
the
application
of
the
term
polarity
which
is
borrowed
from
the
magnet
to
electricity
the
and
which
may
be
substituted
for
this
have
found
as
suitable
an
application
to
many
phenomena
even
the
musician
probably
without
troubling
himself
about
these
other
departments
has
been
naturally
led
to
express
the
leading
difference
in
the
modes
of
melody
by
and
for
ourselves
we
have
long
wished
to
introduce
the
term
polarity
into
the
doctrine
of
colours
with
what
right
and
in
what
sense
the
present
work
may
show
perhaps
we
may
hereafter
find
room
to
connect
the
elementary
phenomena
together
according
to
our
mode
by
a
similar
use
of
symbolical
terms
terms
which
must
at
all
times
convey
the
directly
corresponding
idea
we
shall
thus
render
more
explicit
what
has
been
here
only
alluded
to
generally
and
perhaps
too
vaguely
expressed
eine

literally
division

vi
effect
of
colour
with
reference
to
moral
associations
since
colour
occupies
so
important
a
place
in
the
series
of
elementary
phenomena
filling
as
it
does
the
limited
circle
assigned
to
it
with
fullest
variety
we
shall
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
its
effects
are
at
all
times
decided
and
significant
and
that
they
are
immediately
associated
with
the
emotions
of
the
mind
we
shall
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
these
appearances
presented
singly
are
specific
that
in
combination
they
may
produce
an
harmonious
characteristic
often
even
an
inharmonious
effect
on
the
eye
by
means
of
which
they
act
on
the
mind
producing
this
impression
in
their
most
general
elementary
character
without
relation
to
the
nature
or
form
of
the
object
on
whose
surface
they
are
apparent
hence
colour
considered
as
an
element
of
art
may
be
made
subservient
to
the
highest
æsthetical
note
c
people
experience
a
great
delight
in
colour
generally
the
eye
requires
it
as
much
as
it
requires
light
we
have
only
to
remember
the
refreshing
sensation
we
experience
if
on
a
cloudy
day
the
sun
illumines
a
single
portion
of
the
scene
before
us
and
displays
its
colours
that
healing
powers
were
ascribed
to
coloured
gems
may
have
arisen
from
the
experience
of
this
indefinable
pleasure
the
colours
which
we
see
on
objects
are
not
qualities
entirely
strange
to
the
eye
the
organ
is
not
thus
merely
habituated
to
the
impression
no
it
is
always
predisposed
to
produce
colour
of
itself
and
experiences
a
sensation
of
delight
if
something
analogous
to
its
own
nature
is
offered
to
it
from
without
if
its
susceptibility
is
distinctly
determined
towards
a
given
state
from
some
of
our
earlier
observations
we
can
conclude
that
general
impressions
produced
by
single
colours
can
not
be
changed
that
they
act
specifically
and
must
produce
definite
specific
states
in
the
living
organ
they
likewise
produce
a
corresponding
influence
on
the
mind
experience
teaches
us
that
particular
colours
excite
particular
states
of
feeling
it
is
related
of
a
witty
frenchman

avec
madame

depuis

le
meuble

son
cabinet
qui

in
order
to
experience
these
influences
completely
the
eye
should
be
entirely
surrounded
with
one
colour
we
should
be
in
a
room
of
one
colour
or
look
through
a
coloured
glass
we
are
then
identified
with
the
hue
it
attunes
the
eye
and
mind
in
mere
unison
with
itself
the
colours
on
the
side
are
yellow
orange
minium
cinnabar
the
feelings
they
excite
are
quick
lively
aspiring
yellow
this
is
the
colour
nearest
the
light
it
appears
on
the
slightest
mitigation
of
light
whether
by
mediums
or
faint
reflection
from
white
surfaces
in
prismatic
experiments
it
extends
itself
alone
and
widely
in
the
light
space
and
while
the
two
poles
remain
separated
from
each
other
before
it
mixes
with
blue
to
produce
green
it
is
to
be
seen
in
its
utmost
purity
and
beauty
how
the
chemical
yellow
developes
itself
in
and
upon
the
white
has
been
circumstantially
described
in
its
proper
place
in
its
highest
purity
it
always
carries
with
it
the
nature
of
brightness
and
has
a
serene
gay
softly
exciting
character
in
this
state
applied
to
dress
hangings
carpeting
it
is
agreeable
gold
in
its
perfectly
unmixed
state
especially
when
the
effect
of
polish
is
superadded
gives
us
a
new
and
high
idea
of
this
colour
in
like
manner
a
strong
yellow
as
it
appears
on
satin
has
a
magnificent
and
noble
effect
we
find
from
experience
again
that
yellow
excites
a
warm
and
agreeable
impression
hence
in
painting
it
belongs
to
the
illumined
and
emphatic
side
this
impression
of
warmth
may
be
experienced
in
a
very
lively
manner
if
we
look
at
a
landscape
through
a
yellow
glass
particularly
on
a
grey
winter
day
the
eye
is
gladdened
the
heart
expanded
and
cheered
a
glow
seems
at
once
to
breathe
towards
us
if
however
this
colour
in
its
pure
and
bright
state
is
agreeable
and
gladdening
and
in
its
utmost
power
is
serene
and
noble
it
is
on
the
other
hand
extremely
liable
to
contamination
and
produces
a
very
disagreeable
effect
if
it
is
sullied
or
in
some
degree
tends
to
the
side
thus
the
colour
of
sulphur
which
inclines
to
green
has
a
something
unpleasant
in
it
when
a
yellow
colour
is
communicated
to
dull
and
coarse
surfaces
such
as
common
cloth
felt
or
the
like
on
which
it
does
not
appear
with
full
energy
the
disagreeable
effect
alluded
to
is
apparent
by
a
slight
and
scarcely
perceptible
change
the
beautiful
impression
of
fire
and
gold
is
transformed
into
one
not
undeserving
the
epithet
foul
and
the
colour
of
honour
and
joy
reversed
to
that
of
ignominy
and
aversion
to
this
impression
the
yellow
hats
of
bankrupts
and
the
yellow
circles
on
the
mantles
of
jews
may
have
owed
their
origin
as
no
colour
can
be
considered
as
stationary
so
we
can
very
easily
augment
yellow
into
reddish
by
condensing
or
darkening
it
the
colour
increases
in
energy
and
appears
in
more
powerful
and
splendid
all
that
we
have
said
of
yellow
is
applicable
here
in
a
higher
degree
the
gives
an
impression
of
warmth
and
gladness
since
it
represents
the
hue
of
the
intenser
glow
of
fire
and
of
the
milder
radiance
of
the
setting
sun
hence
it
is
agreeable
around
us
and
again
as
clothing
in
greater
or
less
degrees
is
cheerful
and
magnificent
a
slight
tendency
to
red
immediately
gives
a
new
character
to
yellow
and
while
the
english
and
germans
content
themselves
with
bright
pale
yellow
colours
in
leather
the
french
as
castel
has
remarked
prefer
a
yellow
enhanced
to
red
indeed
in
general
everything
in
colour
is
agreeable
to
them
which
belongs
to
the
active
side
as
pure
yellow
passes
very
easily
to
so
the
deepening
of
this
last
to
is
not
to
be
arrested
the
agreeable
cheerful
sensation
which
excites
increases
to
an
intolerably
powerful
impression
in
bright
the
active
side
is
here
in
its
highest
energy
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
impetuous
robust
uneducated
men
should
be
especially
pleased
with
this
colour
among
savage
nations
the
inclination
for
it
has
been
universally
remarked
and
when
children
left
to
themselves
begin
to
use
tints
they
never
spare
vermilion
and
minium
in
looking
steadfastly
at
a
perfectly
surface
the
colour
seems
actually
to
penetrate
the
organ
it
produces
an
extreme
excitement
and
still
acts
thus
when
somewhat
darkened
a
cloth
disturbs
and
enrages
animals
i
have
known
men
of
education
to
whom
its
effect
was
intolerable
if
they
chanced
to
see
a
person
dressed
in
a
scarlet
cloak
on
a
grey
cloudy
day
the
colours
on
the
side
are
blue
and
they
produce
a
restless
susceptible
anxious
impression
blue
as
yellow
is
always
accompanied
with
light
so
it
may
be
said
that
blue
still
brings
a
principle
of
darkness
with
it
this
colour
has
a
peculiar
and
almost
indescribable
effect
on
the
eye
as
a
hue
it
is
powerful
but
it
is
on
the
negative
side
and
in
its
highest
purity
is
as
it
were
a
stimulating
negation
its
appearance
then
is
a
kind
of
contradiction
between
excitement
and
repose
as
the
upper
sky
and
distant
mountains
appear
blue
so
a
blue
surface
seems
to
retire
from
us
but
as
we
readily
follow
an
agreeable
object
that
flies
from
us
so
we
love
to
contemplate
blue
not
because
it
advances
to
us
but
because
it
draws
us
after
it
blue
gives
us
an
impression
of
cold
and
thus
again
reminds
us
of
shade
we
have
before
spoken
of
its
affinity
with
black
rooms
which
are
hung
with
pure
blue
appear
in
some
degree
larger
but
at
the
same
time
empty
and
cold
the
appearance
of
objects
seen
through
a
blue
glass
is
gloomy
and
melancholy
when
blue
partakes
in
some
degree
of
the
side
the
effect
is
not
disagreeable
is
rather
a
pleasing
colour
we
found
yellow
very
soon
tending
to
the
intense
state
and
we
observe
the
same
progression
in
blue
blue
deepens
very
mildly
into
red
and
thus
acquires
a
somewhat
active
character
although
it
is
on
the
passive
side
its
exciting
power
is
however
of
a
very
different
kind
from
that
of
the
it
may
be
said
to
disturb
rather
than
enliven
as
augmentation
itself
is
not
to
be
arrested
so
we
feel
an
inclination
to
follow
the
progress
of
the
colour
not
however
as
in
the
case
of
the
to
see
it
still
increase
in
the
active
sense
but
to
find
a
point
to
rest
in
in
a
very
attenuated
state
this
colour
is
known
to
us
under
the
name
of
lilac
but
even
in
this
degree
it
has
a
something
lively
without
gladness
this
unquiet
feeling
increases
as
the
hue
progresses
and
it
may
be
safely
assumed
that
a
carpet
of
a
perfectly
pure
deep
would
be
intolerable
on
this
account
when
it
is
used
for
dress
ribbons
or
other
ornaments
it
is
employed
in
a
very
attenuated
and
light
state
and
thus
displays
its
character
as
above
defined
in
a
peculiarly
attractive
manner
as
the
higher
dignitaries
of
the
church
have
appropriated
this
unquiet
colour
to
themselves
we
may
venture
to
say
that
it
unceasingly
aspires
to
the
cardinal
red
through
the
restless
degrees
of
a
still
impatient
progression
red
we
are
here
to
forget
everything
that
borders
on
yellow
or
blue
we
are
to
imagine
an
absolutely
pure
red
like
fine
carmine
suffered
to
dry
on
white
porcelain
we
have
called
this
colour
purpur
by
way
of
distinction
although
we
are
quite
aware
that
the
purple
of
the
ancients
inclined
more
to
blue
whoever
is
acquainted
with
the
prismatic
origin
of
red
will
not
think
it
paradoxical
if
we
assert
that
this
colour
partly
partly
includes
all
the
other
colours
we
have
remarked
a
constant
progress
or
augmentation
in
yellow
and
blue
and
seen
what
impressions
were
produced
by
the
various
states
hence
it
may
naturally
be
inferred
that
now
in
the
junction
of
the
deepened
extremes
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
must
succeed
and
thus
in
physical
phenomena
this
highest
of
all
appearances
of
colour
arises
from
the
junction
of
two
contrasted
extremes
which
have
gradually
prepared
themselves
for
a
union
as
a
pigment
on
the
other
hand
it
presents
itself
to
us
already
formed
and
is
most
perfect
as
a
hue
in
cochineal
a
substance
which
however
by
chemical
action
may
be
made
to
tend
to
the
or
the
side
and
may
be
considered
to
have
attained
the
central
point
in
the
best
carmine
the
effect
of
this
colour
is
as
peculiar
as
its
nature
it
conveys
an
impression
of
gravity
and
dignity
and
at
the
same
time
of
grace
and
attractiveness
the
first
in
its
dark
deep
state
the
latter
in
its
light
attenuated
tint
and
thus
the
dignity
of
age
and
the
amiableness
of
youth
may
adorn
itself
with
degrees
of
the
same
hue
history
relates
many
instances
of
the
jealousy
of
sovereigns
with
regard
to
the
quality
of
red
surrounding
accompaniments
of
this
colour
have
always
a
grave
and
magnificent
effect
the
red
glass
exhibits
a
bright
landscape
in
so
dreadful
a
hue
as
to
inspire
sentiments
of
awe
kermes
and
cochineal
the
two
materials
chiefly
employed
in
dyeing
to
produce
this
colour
incline
more
or
less
to
the
or
state
and
may
be
made
to
pass
and
repass
the
culminating
point
by
the
action
of
acids
and
alkalis
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
french
arrest
their
operations
on
the
active
side
as
is
proved
by
the
french
scarlet
which
inclines
to
yellow
the
italians
on
the
other
hand
remain
on
the
passive
side
for
their
scarlet
has
a
tinge
of
blue
by
means
of
a
similar
alkaline
treatment
the
crimson
is
produced
a
colour
which
the
french
must
be
particularly
prejudiced
against
since
they
employ
the
expressions
sot
en
cramoisi
méchant
en
cramoisi
to
mark
the
extreme
of
the
silly
and
the
reprehensible
green
if
yellow
and
blue
which
we
consider
as
the
most
fundamental
and
simple
colours
are
united
as
they
first
appear
in
the
first
state
of
their
action
the
colour
which
we
call
green
is
the
result
the
eye
experiences
a
distinctly
grateful
impression
from
this
colour
if
the
two
elementary
colours
are
mixed
in
perfect
equality
so
that
neither
predominates
the
eye
and
the
mind
repose
on
the
result
of
this
junction
as
upon
a
simple
colour
the
beholder
has
neither
the
wish
nor
the
power
to
imagine
a
state
beyond
it
hence
for
rooms
to
live
in
constantly
the
green
colour
is
most
generally
selected
completeness
and
harmony
we
have
hitherto
assumed
for
the
sake
of
clearer
explanation
that
the
eye
can
be
compelled
to
assimilate
or
identify
itself
with
a
single
colour
but
this
can
only
be
possible
for
an
instant
for
when
we
find
ourselves
surrounded
by
a
given
colour
which
excites
its
corresponding
sensation
on
the
eye
and
compels
us
by
its
presence
to
remain
in
a
state
identical
with
it
this
state
is
soon
found
to
be
forced
and
the
organ
unwillingly
remains
in
it
when
the
eye
sees
a
colour
it
is
immediately
excited
and
it
is
its
nature
spontaneously
and
of
necessity
at
once
to
produce
another
which
with
the
original
colour
comprehends
the
whole
chromatic
scale
a
single
colour
excites
by
a
specific
sensation
the
tendency
to
universality
to
experience
this
completeness
to
satisfy
itself
the
eye
seeks
for
a
colourless
space
next
every
hue
in
order
to
produce
the
complemental
hue
upon
it
in
this
resides
the
fundamental
law
of
all
harmony
of
colours
of
which
every
one
may
convince
himself
by
making
himself
accurately
acquainted
with
the
experiments
which
we
have
described
in
the
chapter
on
the
physiological
colours
if
again
the
entire
scale
is
presented
to
the
eye
externally
the
impression
is
gladdening
since
the
result
of
its
own
operation
is
presented
to
it
in
reality
we
turn
our
attention
therefore
in
the
first
place
to
this
harmonious
juxtaposition
as
a
very
simple
means
of
comprehending
the
principle
of
this
the
reader
has
only
to
imagine
a
moveable
diametrical
index
in
the
colorific
circle
the
index
as
it
revolves
round
the
whole
circle
indicates
at
its
two
extremes
the
complemental
colours
which
after
all
may
be
reduced
to
three
contrasts
yellow
demands
blue
demands
red
demands
green
and
contrariwise
in
proportion
as
one
end
of
the
supposed
index
deviates
from
the
central
intensity
of
the
colours
arranged
as
they
are
in
the
natural
order
so
the
opposite
end
changes
its
place
in
the
contrasted
gradation
and
by
such
a
simple
contrivance
the
complemental
colours
may
be
indicated
at
any
given
point
a
chromatic
circle
might
be
made
for
this
purpose
not
confined
like
our
own
to
the
leading
colours
but
exhibiting
them
with
their
transitions
in
an
unbroken
series
this
would
not
be
without
its
use
for
we
are
here
considering
a
very
important
point
which
deserves
all
our
attention
we
before
stated
that
the
eye
could
be
in
some
degree
pathologically
affected
by
being
long
confined
to
a
single
colour
that
again
definite
moral
impressions
were
thus
produced
at
one
time
lively
and
aspiring
at
another
susceptible
and
anxious
now
exalted
to
grand
associations
now
reduced
to
ordinary
ones
we
now
observe
that
the
demand
for
completeness
which
is
inherent
in
the
organ
frees
us
from
this
restraint
the
eye
relieves
itself
by
producing
the
opposite
of
the
single
colour
forced
upon
it
and
thus
attains
the
entire
impression
which
is
so
satisfactory
to
it
simple
therefore
as
these
strictly
harmonious
contrasts
are
as
presented
to
us
in
the
narrow
circle
the
hint
is
important
that
nature
tends
to
emancipate
the
sense
from
confined
impressions
by
suggesting
and
producing
the
whole
and
that
in
this
instance
we
have
a
natural
phenomenon
immediately
applicable
to
æsthetic
purposes
while
therefore
we
may
assert
that
the
chromatic
scale
as
given
by
us
produces
an
agreeable
impression
by
its
ingredient
hues
we
may
here
remark
that
those
have
been
mistaken
who
have
hitherto
adduced
the
rainbow
as
an
example
of
the
entire
scale
for
the
chief
colour
pure
red
is
deficient
in
it
and
can
not
be
produced
since
in
this
phenomenon
as
well
as
in
the
ordinary
prismatic
series
the
and
can
not
attain
to
a
union
nature
perhaps
exhibits
no
general
phenomenon
where
the
scale
is
in
complete
combination
by
artificial
experiments
such
an
appearance
may
be
produced
in
its
perfect
splendour
the
mode
however
in
which
the
entire
series
is
connected
in
a
circle
is
rendered
most
intelligible
by
tints
on
paper
till
after
much
experience
and
practice
aided
by
due
susceptibility
of
the
organ
we
become
penetrated
with
the
idea
of
this
harmony
and
feel
it
present
in
our
minds
besides
these
pure
harmonious
combinations
which
always
carry
the
conditions
of
completeness
with
them
there
are
others
which
may
be
arbitrarily
produced
and
which
may
be
most
easily
described
by
observing
that
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
colorific
circle
not
by
diameters
but
by
chords
in
such
a
manner
that
an
intermediate
colour
is
passed
over
we
call
these
combinations
characteristic
because
they
have
all
a
certain
significancy
and
tend
to
excite
a
definite
impression
an
impression
however
which
does
not
altogether
satisfy
inasmuch
as
every
characteristic
quality
of
necessity
presents
itself
only
as
a
part
of
a
whole
with
which
it
has
a
relation
but
into
which
it
can
not
be
resolved
as
we
are
acquainted
with
the
impressions
produced
by
the
colours
singly
as
well
as
in
their
harmonious
relations
we
may
at
once
conclude
that
the
character
of
the
arbitrary
combinations
will
be
very
different
from
each
other
as
regards
their
significancy
we
proceed
to
review
them
separately
yellow
and
blue
this
is
the
simplest
of
such
combinations
it
may
be
said
that
it
contains
too
little
for
since
every
trace
of
red
is
wanting
in
it
it
is
defective
as
compared
with
the
whole
scale
in
this
view
it
may
be
called
poor
and
as
the
two
contrasting
elements
are
in
their
lowest
state
may
be
said
to
be
ordinary
yet
it
is
recommended
by
its
proximity
to
green
in
short
by
containing
the
ingredients
of
an
ultimate
state
yellow
and
red
this
is
a
somewhat
preponderating
combination
but
it
has
a
serene
and
magnificent
effect
the
two
extremes
of
the
active
side
are
seen
together
without
conveying
any
idea
of
progression
from
one
to
the
other
as
the
result
of
their
combination
in
pigments
is
so
they
in
some
degree
represent
this
colour
blue
and
red
the
two
ends
of
the
passive
side
with
the
excess
of
the
upper
end
of
the
active
side
the
effect
of
this
juxtaposition
approaches
that
of
the
produced
by
their
union
and
these
when
placed
together
as
the
deepened
extremes
of
both
sides
have
something
exciting
elevated
they
give
us
a
presentiment
of
red
which
in
physical
experiments
is
produced
by
their
union
these
four
combinations
have
also
the
common
quality
of
producing
the
intermediate
colour
of
our
colorific
circle
by
their
union
a
union
which
actually
takes
place
if
they
are
opposed
to
each
other
in
small
quantities
and
seen
from
a
distance
a
surface
covered
with
narrow
blue
and
yellow
stripes
appears
green
at
a
certain
distance
if
again
the
eye
sees
blue
and
yellow
next
each
other
it
finds
itself
in
a
peculiar
disposition
to
produce
green
without
accomplishing
it
while
it
neither
experiences
a
satisfactory
sensation
in
contemplating
the
detached
colours
nor
an
impression
of
completeness
in
the
two
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
it
was
not
without
reason
we
called
these
combinations
characteristic
the
more
so
since
the
character
of
each
combination
must
have
a
relation
to
that
of
the
single
colours
of
which
it
consists
combinations
we
now
turn
our
attention
to
the
last
kind
of
combinations
these
are
easily
found
in
the
circle
they
are
indicated
by
shorter
chords
for
in
this
case
we
do
not
pass
over
an
entire
intermediate
colour
but
only
the
transition
from
one
to
the
other
these
combinations
may
justly
be
called
inasmuch
as
the
colours
are
too
nearly
alike
for
their
impression
to
be
significant
yet
most
of
these
recommend
themselves
to
a
certain
degree
since
they
indicate
a
progressive
state
though
its
relations
can
hardly
be
appreciable
thus
yellow
and
and
red
blue
and
and
red
represent
the
nearest
degrees
of
augmentation
and
culmination
and
in
certain
relations
as
to
quantity
may
produce
no
unpleasant
effect
the
juxtaposition
of
yellow
and
green
has
always
something
ordinary
but
in
a
cheerful
sense
blue
and
green
on
the
other
hand
is
ordinary
in
a
repulsive
sense
our
good
forefathers
called
these
last
colours
relation
of
the
combinations
to
light
and
dark
these
combinations
may
be
very
much
varied
by
making
both
colours
light
or
both
dark
or
one
light
and
the
other
dark
in
which
modifications
however
all
that
has
been
found
true
in
a
general
sense
is
applicable
to
each
particular
case
with
regard
to
the
infinite
variety
thus
produced
we
merely
observe
the
colours
of
the
active
side
placed
next
to
black
gain
in
energy
those
of
the
passive
side
lose
the
active
conjoined
with
white
and
brightness
lose
in
strength
the
passive
gain
in
cheerfulness
red
and
green
with
black
appear
dark
and
grave
with
white
they
appear
gay
to
this
we
may
add
that
all
colours
may
be
more
or
less
broken
or
neutralised
may
to
a
certain
degree
be
rendered
nameless
and
thus
combined
partly
together
and
partly
with
pure
colours
but
although
the
relations
may
thus
be
varied
to
infinity
still
all
that
is
applicable
with
regard
to
the
pure
colours
will
be
applicable
in
these
cases
considerations
derived
from
the
evidence
of
experience
and
history
the
principles
of
the
harmony
of
colours
having
been
thus
far
defined
it
may
not
be
irrelevant
to
review
what
has
been
adduced
in
connexion
with
experience
and
historical
examples
the
principles
in
question
have
been
derived
from
the
constitution
of
our
nature
and
the
constant
relations
which
are
found
to
obtain
in
chromatic
phenomena
in
experience
we
find
much
that
is
in
conformity
with
these
principles
and
much
that
is
opposed
to
them
men
in
a
state
of
nature
uncivilised
nations
children
have
a
great
fondness
for
colours
in
their
utmost
brightness
and
especially
for
they
are
also
pleased
with
the
motley
by
this
expression
we
understand
the
juxtaposition
of
vivid
colours
without
an
harmonious
balance
but
if
this
balance
is
observed
through
instinct
or
accident
an
agreeable
effect
may
be
produced
i
remember
a
hessian
officer
returned
from
america
who
had
painted
his
face
with
the
positive
colours
in
the
manner
of
the
indians
a
kind
of
completeness
or
due
balance
was
thus
produced
the
effect
of
which
was
not
disagreeable
the
inhabitants
of
the
south
of
europe
make
use
of
very
brilliant
colours
for
their
dresses
the
circumstance
of
their
procuring
silk
stuffs
at
a
cheap
rate
is
favourable
to
this
propensity
the
women
especially
with
their
bodices
and
ribbons
are
always
in
harmony
with
the
scenery
since
they
can
not
possibly
surpass
the
splendour
of
the
sky
and
landscape
the
history
of
dyeing
teaches
us
that
certain
technical
conveniences
and
advantages
have
had
great
influence
on
the
costume
of
nations
we
find
that
the
germans
wear
blue
very
generally
because
it
is
a
permanent
colour
in
cloth
so
in
many
districts
all
the
country
people
wear
green
twill
because
that
material
takes
a
green
dye
well
if
a
traveller
were
to
pay
attention
to
these
circumstances
he
might
collect
some
amusing
and
curious
facts
colours
as
connected
with
particular
frames
of
mind
are
again
a
consequence
of
peculiar
character
and
circumstances
lively
nations
the
french
for
instance
love
intense
colours
especially
on
the
active
side
sedate
nations
like
the
english
and
germans
wear
or
yellow
accompanied
with
dark
blue
nations
aiming
at
dignity
of
appearance
the
spaniards
and
italians
for
instance
suffer
the
red
colour
of
their
mantles
to
incline
to
the
passive
side
in
dress
we
associate
the
character
of
the
colour
with
the
character
of
the
person
we
may
thus
observe
the
relation
of
colours
singly
and
in
combination
to
the
colour
of
the
complexion
age
and
station
the
female
sex
in
youth
is
attached
to
and
in
age
to
violet
and
the
prefer
violet
as
opposed
to
light
yellow
the
brunettes
blue
as
opposed
to
and
all
on
good
grounds
the
roman
emperors
were
extremely
jealous
with
regard
to
their
purple
the
robe
of
the
chinese
emperor
is
orange
embroidered
with
red
his
attendants
and
the
ministers
of
religion
wear
people
of
refinement
have
a
disinclination
to
colours
this
may
be
owing
partly
to
weakness
of
sight
partly
to
the
uncertainty
of
taste
which
readily
takes
refuge
in
absolute
negation
women
now
appear
almost
universally
in
white
and
men
in
black
an
observation
very
generally
applicable
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
namely
that
man
desirous
as
he
is
of
being
distinguished
is
quite
as
willing
to
be
lost
among
his
fellows
black
was
intended
to
remind
the
venetian
noblemen
of
republican
equality
to
what
degree
the
cloudy
sky
of
northern
climates
may
have
gradually
banished
colour
may
also
admit
of
explanation
the
scale
of
positive
colours
is
obviously
soon
exhausted
on
the
other
hand
the
neutral
subdued
fashionable
colours
present
infinitely
varying
degrees
and
shades
most
of
which
are
not
unpleasing
it
is
also
to
be
remarked
that
ladies
in
wearing
positive
colours
are
in
danger
of
making
a
complexion
which
may
not
be
very
bright
still
less
so
and
thus
to
preserve
a
due
balance
with
such
brilliant
accompaniments
they
are
induced
to
heighten
their
complexions
artificially
an
amusing
inquiry
might
be
made
which
would
lead
to
a
critique
of
uniforms
liveries
cockades
and
other
distinctions
according
to
the
principles
above
hinted
at
it
might
be
observed
generally
that
such
dresses
and
insignia
should
not
be
composed
of
harmonious
colours
uniforms
should
be
characteristic
and
dignified
liveries
might
be
ordinary
and
striking
to
the
eye
examples
both
good
and
bad
would
not
be
wanting
since
the
scale
of
colours
usually
employed
for
such
purposes
is
limited
and
its
varieties
have
been
often
enough
tried
æsthetic
influence
from
the
moral
associations
connected
with
the
appearance
of
colours
single
or
combined
their
æsthetic
influence
may
now
be
deduced
for
the
artist
we
shall
touch
the
most
essential
points
to
be
attended
to
after
first
considering
the
general
condition
of
pictorial
representation
light
and
shade
with
which
the
appearance
of
colour
is
immediately
connected
we
apply
the
term
helldunkel
to
the
appearance
of
material
objects
when
the
mere
effect
produced
on
them
by
light
and
shade
is
note
d
in
a
narrower
sense
a
mass
of
shadow
lighted
by
reflexes
is
often
thus
designated
but
we
here
use
the
expression
in
its
first
and
more
general
sense
the
separation
of
light
and
dark
from
all
appearance
of
colour
is
possible
and
necessary
the
artist
will
solve
the
mystery
of
imitation
sooner
by
first
considering
light
and
dark
independently
of
colour
and
making
himself
acquainted
with
it
in
its
whole
extent
exhibits
the
substance
as
substance
inasmuch
as
light
and
shade
inform
us
as
to
degrees
of
density
we
have
here
to
consider
the
highest
light
the
middle
tint
and
the
shadow
and
in
the
last
the
shadow
of
the
object
itself
the
shadow
it
casts
on
other
objects
and
the
illumined
shadow
or
reflexion
the
globe
is
well
adapted
for
the
general
exemplification
of
the
nature
of
but
it
is
not
altogether
sufficient
the
softened
unity
of
such
complete
rotundity
tends
to
the
vapoury
and
in
order
to
serve
as
a
principle
for
effects
of
art
it
should
be
composed
of
plane
surfaces
so
as
to
define
the
gradations
more
the
italians
call
this
manner
il
piazzoso
in
german
it
might
be
called
das
flächenhafte
if
therefore
the
sphere
is
a
perfect
example
of
natural
a
polygon
would
exhibit
the
treatment
in
which
all
kinds
of
lights
shadows
and
reflexions
would
be
note
e
the
bunch
of
grapes
is
recognised
as
a
good
example
of
a
picturesque
completeness
in
the
more
so
as
it
is
fitted
from
its
form
to
represent
a
principal
group
but
it
is
only
available
for
the
master
who
can
see
in
it
what
he
has
the
power
of
producing
in
order
to
make
the
first
idea
intelligible
to
the
beginner
for
it
is
difficult
to
consider
it
abstractedly
even
in
a
polygon
we
may
take
a
cube
the
three
sides
of
which
that
are
seen
represent
the
light
the
middle
tint
and
the
shadow
in
distinct
order
to
proceed
again
to
the
of
a
more
complicated
figure
we
might
select
the
example
of
an
open
book
which
presents
a
greater
diversity
we
find
the
antique
statues
of
the
best
time
treated
very
much
with
reference
to
these
effects
the
parts
intended
to
receive
the
light
are
wrought
with
simplicity
the
portion
originally
in
shade
is
on
the
other
hand
in
more
distinct
surfaces
to
make
them
susceptible
of
a
variety
of
reflexions
here
the
example
of
the
polygon
will
be
note
f
the
pictures
of
herculaneum
and
the
aldobrandini
marriage
are
examples
of
antique
painting
in
the
same
style
modern
examples
may
be
found
in
single
figures
by
raphael
in
entire
works
by
correggio
and
also
by
the
flemish
masters
especially
rubens
tendency
to
colour
a
picture
in
black
and
white
seldom
makes
its
appearance
some
works
of
polidoro
are
examples
of
this
kind
of
art
such
works
inasmuch
as
they
can
attain
form
and
keeping
are
estimable
but
they
have
little
attraction
for
the
eye
since
their
very
existence
supposes
a
violent
abstraction
if
the
artist
abandons
himself
to
his
feeling
colour
presently
announces
itself
black
no
sooner
inclines
to
blue
than
the
eye
demands
yellow
which
the
artist
instinctively
modifies
and
introduces
partly
pure
in
the
light
partly
reddened
and
subdued
as
brown
in
the
reflexes
thus
enlivening
the
note
g
all
kinds
of
or
colour
on
similar
colour
end
in
the
introduction
either
of
a
complemental
contrast
or
some
variety
of
hue
thus
polidoro
in
his
black
and
white
frescoes
sometimes
introduced
a
yellow
vase
or
something
of
the
kind
in
general
it
may
be
observed
that
men
have
at
all
times
instinctively
striven
after
colour
in
the
practice
of
the
art
we
need
only
observe
daily
how
soon
amateurs
proceed
from
colourless
to
coloured
materials
paolo
uccello
painted
coloured
landscapes
to
colourless
note
h
even
the
sculpture
of
the
ancients
could
not
be
exempt
from
the
influence
of
this
propensity
the
egyptians
painted
their
statues
had
eyes
of
coloured
stones
porphyry
draperies
were
added
to
marble
heads
and
extremities
and
variegated
stalactites
were
used
for
the
pedestals
of
busts
the
jesuits
did
not
fail
to
compose
the
statue
of
their
luigi
in
rome
in
this
manner
and
the
most
modern
sculpture
distinguishes
the
flesh
from
the
drapery
by
staining
the
latter
keeping
if
linear
perspective
displays
the
gradation
of
objects
in
their
apparent
size
as
affected
by
distance
aërial
perspective
shows
us
their
gradation
in
greater
or
less
distinctness
as
affected
by
the
same
cause
although
from
the
nature
of
the
organ
of
sight
we
can
not
see
distant
objects
so
distinctly
as
nearer
ones
yet
aërial
perspective
is
grounded
strictly
on
the
important
fact
that
all
mediums
called
transparent
are
in
some
degree
dim
the
atmosphere
is
thus
always
more
or
less
this
quality
is
remarkable
in
southern
climates
even
when
the
barometer
is
high
the
weather
dry
and
the
sky
cloudless
for
a
very
pronounced
gradation
is
observable
between
objects
but
little
removed
from
each
other
the
appearance
on
a
large
scale
is
known
to
every
one
the
painter
however
sees
or
believes
he
sees
the
gradation
in
the
slightest
varieties
of
distance
he
exemplifies
it
practically
by
making
a
distinction
for
instance
in
the
features
of
a
face
according
to
their
relative
position
as
regards
the
plane
of
the
picture
the
direction
of
the
light
is
attended
to
in
like
manner
this
is
considered
to
produce
a
gradation
from
side
to
side
while
keeping
has
reference
to
depth
to
the
comparative
distinctness
of
near
and
distant
things
in
proceeding
to
consider
this
subject
we
assume
that
the
painter
is
generally
acquainted
with
our
sketch
of
the
theory
of
colours
and
that
he
has
made
himself
well
acquainted
with
certain
chapters
and
rubrics
which
especially
concern
him
he
will
thus
be
enabled
to
make
use
of
theory
as
well
as
practice
in
recognising
the
principles
of
effect
in
nature
and
in
employing
the
means
of
art
colour
in
general
nature
the
first
indication
of
colour
announces
itself
in
nature
together
with
the
gradations
of
aërial
perspective
for
aërial
perspective
is
intimately
connected
with
the
doctrine
of
mediums
we
see
the
sky
distant
objects
and
even
comparatively
near
shadows
blue
at
the
same
moment
the
illuminating
and
illuminated
objects
appear
yellow
gradually
deepening
to
red
in
many
cases
the
physiological
suggestion
of
contrasts
comes
into
the
account
and
an
entirely
colourless
landscape
by
means
of
these
assisting
and
counteracting
tendencies
appears
to
our
eyes
completely
coloured
local
colours
are
composed
of
the
general
elementary
colours
but
these
are
determined
or
specified
according
to
the
properties
of
substances
and
surfaces
on
which
they
appear
this
specification
is
infinite
thus
there
is
at
once
a
great
difference
between
silk
and
wool
similarly
dyed
every
kind
of
preparation
and
texture
produces
corresponding
modifications
roughness
smoothness
polish
all
are
to
be
considered
it
is
therefore
one
of
the
pernicious
prejudices
of
art
that
the
skilful
painter
must
never
attend
to
the
material
of
draperies
but
always
represent
as
it
were
only
abstract
folds
is
not
all
characteristic
variety
thus
done
away
with
and
is
the
portrait
of
leo
less
excellent
because
velvet
satin
and
moreen
are
imitated
in
their
relative
effect
in
the
productions
of
nature
colours
appear
more
or
less
modified
specified
even
individualised
this
may
be
readily
observed
in
minerals
and
plants
in
the
feathers
of
birds
and
the
skins
of
beasts
the
chief
art
of
the
painter
is
always
to
imitate
the
actual
appearance
of
the
definite
hue
doing
away
with
the
recollection
of
the
elementary
ingredients
of
colour
this
difficulty
is
in
no
instance
greater
than
in
the
imitation
of
the
surface
of
the
human
figure
the
colour
of
flesh
as
a
whole
belongs
to
the
active
side
yet
the
bluish
of
the
passive
side
mingles
with
it
the
colour
is
altogether
removed
from
the
elementary
state
and
neutralised
by
organisation
to
bring
the
colouring
of
general
nature
into
harmony
with
the
colouring
of
a
given
object
will
perhaps
be
more
attainable
for
the
judicious
artist
after
the
consideration
of
what
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
foregoing
theory
for
the
most
fancifully
beautiful
and
varied
appearances
may
still
be
made
true
to
the
principles
of
nature
characteristic
colouring
the
combination
of
coloured
objects
as
well
as
the
colour
of
their
ground
should
depend
on
considerations
which
the
artist
for
himself
here
a
reference
to
the
effect
of
colours
singly
or
combined
on
the
feelings
is
especially
necessary
on
this
account
the
painter
should
possess
himself
with
the
idea
of
the
general
dualism
as
well
as
of
particular
contrasts
not
forgetting
what
has
been
adverted
to
with
regard
to
the
qualities
of
colours
the
characteristic
in
colour
may
be
comprehended
under
three
leading
rubrics
which
we
here
define
as
the
powerful
the
soft
and
the
splendid
the
first
is
produced
by
the
preponderance
of
the
active
side
the
second
by
that
of
the
passive
side
and
the
third
by
completeness
by
the
exhibition
of
the
whole
chromatic
scale
in
due
balance
the
powerful
impression
is
attained
by
yellow
and
red
which
last
colour
is
to
be
arrested
on
the
plus
side
but
little
violet
and
blue
still
less
green
are
admissible
the
soft
effect
is
produced
by
blue
violet
and
red
which
in
this
case
is
arrested
on
the
minus
side
a
moderate
addition
of
yellow
and
but
much
green
may
be
admitted
if
it
is
proposed
to
produce
both
these
effects
in
their
full
significancy
the
complemental
colours
may
be
excluded
to
a
minimum
and
only
so
much
of
them
may
be
suffered
to
appear
as
is
indispensable
to
convey
an
impression
of
completeness
harmonious
colouring
although
the
two
characteristic
divisions
as
above
defined
may
in
some
sense
be
also
called
harmonious
the
harmonious
effect
properly
so
called
only
takes
place
when
all
the
colours
are
exhibited
together
in
due
balance
in
this
way
the
splendid
as
well
as
the
agreeable
may
be
produced
both
of
these
however
have
of
necessity
a
certain
generalised
effect
and
in
this
sense
may
be
considered
the
reverse
of
the
characteristic
this
is
the
reason
why
the
colouring
of
most
modern
painters
is
without
character
for
while
they
follow
their
general
instinctive
feeling
only
the
last
result
of
such
a
tendency
must
be
mere
completeness
this
they
more
or
less
attain
but
thus
at
the
same
time
neglect
the
characteristic
impression
which
the
subject
might
demand
but
if
the
principles
before
alluded
to
are
kept
in
view
it
must
be
apparent
that
a
distinct
style
of
colour
may
be
adopted
on
safe
grounds
for
every
subject
the
application
requires
it
is
true
infinite
modifications
which
can
only
succeed
in
the
hands
of
genius
genuine
tone
if
the
word
tone
or
rather
tune
is
to
be
still
borrowed
in
future
from
music
and
applied
to
colouring
it
might
be
used
in
a
better
sense
than
heretofore
for
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
to
compare
a
painting
of
powerful
effect
with
a
piece
of
music
in
a
sharp
key
a
painting
of
soft
effect
with
a
piece
of
music
in
a
flat
key
while
other
equivalents
might
be
found
for
the
modifications
of
these
two
leading
modes
false
tone
the
word
tone
has
been
hitherto
understood
to
mean
a
veil
of
a
particular
colour
spread
over
the
whole
picture
it
was
generally
yellow
for
the
painter
instinctively
pushed
the
effect
towards
the
powerful
side
if
we
look
at
a
picture
through
a
yellow
glass
it
will
appear
in
this
tone
it
is
worth
while
to
make
this
experiment
again
and
again
in
order
to
observe
what
takes
place
in
such
an
operation
it
is
a
sort
of
artificial
light
deepening
and
at
the
same
time
darkening
the
side
and
neutralising
the
side
this
spurious
tone
is
produced
instinctively
through
uncertainty
as
to
the
means
of
attaining
a
genuine
effect
so
that
instead
of
completeness
monotony
is
the
result
weak
colouring
it
is
owing
to
the
same
uncertainty
that
the
colours
are
sometimes
so
much
broken
as
to
have
the
effect
of
a
grey
camayeu
the
handling
being
at
the
same
time
as
delicate
as
possible
the
harmonious
contrasts
are
often
found
to
be
very
happily
felt
in
such
pictures
but
without
spirit
owing
to
a
dread
of
the
motley
the
motley
a
picture
may
easily
become
or
motley
when
the
colours
are
placed
next
each
other
in
their
full
force
as
it
were
only
mechanically
and
according
to
uncertain
impressions
if
on
the
other
hand
weak
colours
are
combined
even
although
they
may
be
dissonant
the
effect
as
a
matter
of
course
is
not
striking
the
uncertainty
of
the
artist
is
communicated
to
the
spectator
who
on
his
side
can
neither
praise
nor
censure
it
is
also
important
to
observe
that
the
colours
may
be
disposed
rightly
in
themselves
but
that
a
work
may
still
appear
motley
if
they
are
falsely
arranged
in
relation
to
light
and
shade
this
may
the
more
easily
occur
as
light
and
shade
are
already
defined
in
the
drawing
and
are
as
it
were
comprehended
in
it
while
the
colour
still
remains
open
to
selection
dread
of
theory
a
dread
of
nay
a
decided
aversion
for
all
theoretical
views
respecting
colour
and
everything
belonging
to
it
has
been
hitherto
found
to
exist
among
painters
a
prejudice
for
which
after
all
they
were
not
to
be
blamed
for
what
has
been
hitherto
called
theory
was
groundless
vacillating
and
akin
to
empiricism
we
hope
that
our
labours
may
tend
to
diminish
this
prejudice
and
stimulate
the
artist
practically
to
prove
and
embody
the
principles
that
have
been
explained
ultimate
aim
but
without
a
comprehensive
view
of
the
whole
of
our
theory
the
ultimate
object
will
not
be
attained
let
the
artist
penetrate
himself
with
all
that
we
have
stated
it
is
only
by
means
of
harmonious
relations
in
light
and
shade
in
keeping
in
true
and
characteristic
colouring
that
a
picture
can
be
considered
complete
in
the
sense
we
have
now
learnt
to
attach
to
the
term
grounds
it
was
the
practice
of
the
earlier
artists
to
paint
on
light
grounds
this
ground
consisted
of
gypsum
and
was
thickly
spread
on
linen
or
panel
and
then
levigated
after
the
outline
was
drawn
the
subject
was
washed
in
with
a
blackish
or
brownish
colour
pictures
prepared
in
this
manner
for
colouring
are
still
in
existence
by
leonardo
da
vinci
and
fra
bartolomeo
there
are
also
several
by
note
i
i
when
the
artist
proceeded
to
colour
and
had
to
represent
white
draperies
he
sometimes
suffered
the
ground
to
remain
untouched
titian
did
this
latterly
when
he
had
attained
the
greatest
certainty
in
practice
and
could
accomplish
much
with
little
labour
the
whitish
ground
was
left
as
a
middle
tint
the
shadows
painted
in
and
the
high
lights
touched
note
k
in
the
process
of
colouring
the
preparation
merely
washed
as
it
were
underneath
was
always
effective
a
drapery
for
example
was
painted
with
a
transparent
colour
the
white
ground
shone
through
it
and
gave
the
colour
life
so
the
parts
previously
prepared
for
shadows
exhibited
the
colour
subdued
without
being
mixed
or
sullied
this
method
had
many
advantages
for
the
painter
had
a
light
ground
for
the
light
portions
of
his
work
and
a
dark
ground
for
the
shadowed
portions
the
whole
picture
was
prepared
the
artist
could
work
with
thin
colours
in
the
shadows
and
had
always
an
internal
light
to
give
value
to
his
tints
in
our
own
time
painting
in
water
colours
depends
on
the
same
principles
indeed
a
light
ground
is
now
generally
employed
in
because
middle
tints
are
thus
found
to
be
more
transparent
and
are
in
some
degree
enlivened
by
a
bright
ground
the
shadows
again
do
not
so
easily
become
black
it
was
the
practice
for
a
time
to
paint
on
dark
grounds
tintoret
probably
introduced
them
titian
best
pictures
are
not
painted
on
a
dark
ground
the
ground
in
question
was
and
when
the
subject
was
drawn
upon
it
the
strongest
shadows
were
laid
in
the
colours
of
the
lights
impasted
very
thickly
in
the
bright
parts
and
scumbled
towards
the
shadows
so
that
the
dark
ground
appeared
through
the
thin
colour
as
a
middle
tint
effect
was
attained
in
finishing
by
frequently
going
over
the
bright
parts
and
touching
on
the
high
lights
if
this
method
especially
recommended
itself
in
practice
on
account
of
the
rapidity
it
allowed
of
yet
it
had
pernicious
consequences
the
strong
ground
increased
and
became
darker
and
the
light
colours
losing
their
brightness
by
degrees
gave
the
shadowed
portions
more
and
more
preponderance
the
middle
tints
became
darker
and
darker
and
the
shadows
at
last
quite
obscure
the
strongly
impasted
lights
alone
remained
bright
and
we
now
see
only
light
spots
on
the
painting
the
pictures
of
the
bolognese
school
and
of
caravaggio
afford
sufficient
examples
of
these
results
we
may
here
in
conclusion
observe
that
glazing
derives
its
effect
from
treating
the
prepared
colour
underneath
as
a
light
ground
by
this
operation
colours
may
have
the
effect
of
being
mixed
to
the
eye
may
be
enhanced
and
may
acquire
what
is
called
tone
but
they
thus
necessarily
become
darker
pigments
we
receive
these
from
the
hands
of
the
chemist
and
the
investigator
of
nature
much
has
been
recorded
respecting
colouring
substances
which
is
familiar
to
all
by
means
of
the
press
but
such
directions
require
to
be
revised
from
time
to
time
the
master
meanwhile
communicates
his
experience
in
these
matters
to
his
scholar
and
artists
generally
to
each
other
those
pigments
which
according
to
their
nature
are
the
most
permanent
are
naturally
much
sought
after
but
the
mode
of
employing
them
also
contributes
much
to
the
duration
of
a
picture
the
fewest
possible
colouring
materials
are
to
be
employed
and
the
simplest
methods
of
using
them
can
not
be
sufficiently
recommended
for
from
the
multitude
of
pigments
colouring
has
suffered
much
every
pigment
has
its
peculiar
nature
as
regards
its
effect
on
the
eye
besides
this
it
has
its
peculiar
quality
requiring
a
corresponding
technical
method
in
its
application
the
former
circumstance
is
a
reason
why
harmony
is
more
difficult
of
attainment
with
many
materials
than
with
few
the
latter
why
chemical
action
and
may
take
place
among
the
colouring
substances
we
may
refer
besides
to
some
false
tendencies
which
the
artists
suffer
themselves
to
be
led
away
with
painters
are
always
looking
for
new
colouring
substances
and
believe
when
such
a
substance
is
discovered
that
they
have
made
an
advance
in
the
art
they
have
a
great
curiosity
to
know
the
practical
methods
of
the
old
masters
and
lose
much
time
in
the
search
towards
the
end
of
the
last
century
we
were
thus
long
tormented
with
others
turn
their
attention
to
the
discovery
of
new
methods
through
which
nothing
new
is
accomplished
for
after
all
it
is
the
feeling
of
the
artist
only
that
informs
every
kind
of
technical
process
allegorical
symbolical
mystical
application
of
colour
it
has
been
circumstantially
shown
above
that
every
colour
produces
a
distinct
impression
on
the
mind
and
thus
addresses
at
once
the
eye
and
feelings
hence
it
follows
that
colour
may
be
employed
for
certain
moral
and
æsthetic
ends
such
an
application
coinciding
entirely
with
nature
might
be
called
symbolical
since
the
colour
would
be
employed
in
conformity
with
its
effect
and
would
at
once
express
its
meaning
if
for
example
pure
red
were
assumed
to
designate
majesty
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
would
be
admitted
to
be
a
just
and
expressive
symbol
all
this
has
been
already
sufficiently
entered
into
another
application
is
nearly
allied
to
this
it
might
be
called
the
allegorical
application
in
this
there
is
more
of
accident
and
caprice
inasmuch
as
the
meaning
of
the
sign
must
be
first
communicated
to
us
before
we
know
what
it
is
to
signify
what
idea
for
instance
is
attached
to
the
green
colour
which
has
been
appropriated
to
hope
that
lastly
colour
may
have
a
mystical
allusion
may
be
readily
surmised
for
since
every
diagram
in
which
the
variety
of
colours
may
be
represented
points
to
those
primordial
relations
which
belong
both
to
nature
and
the
organ
of
vision
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
these
may
be
made
use
of
as
a
language
in
cases
where
it
is
proposed
to
express
similar
primordial
relations
which
do
not
present
themselves
to
the
senses
in
so
powerful
and
varied
a
manner
the
mathematician
extols
the
value
and
applicability
of
the
triangle
the
triangle
is
revered
by
the
mystic
much
admits
of
being
expressed
in
it
by
diagrams
and
among
other
things
the
law
of
the
phenomena
of
colours
in
this
case
indeed
we
presently
arrive
at
the
ancient
mysterious
hexagon
when
the
distinction
of
yellow
and
blue
is
duly
comprehended
and
especially
the
augmentation
into
red
by
means
of
which
the
opposite
qualities
tend
towards
each
other
and
become
united
in
a
third
then
certainly
an
especially
mysterious
interpretation
will
suggest
itself
since
a
spiritual
meaning
may
be
connected
with
these
facts
and
when
we
find
the
two
separate
principles
producing
green
on
the
one
hand
and
red
in
their
intenser
state
we
can
hardly
refrain
from
thinking
in
the
first
case
on
the
earthly
in
the
last
on
the
heavenly
generation
of
the
note
l
but
we
shall
do
better
not
to
expose
ourselves
in
conclusion
to
the
suspicion
of
enthusiasm
since
if
our
doctrine
of
colours
finds
favour
applications
and
allusions
allegorical
symbolical
and
mystical
will
not
fail
to
be
made
in
conformity
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
concluding
observations
in
reviewing
this
labour
which
has
occupied
me
long
and
which
at
last
i
give
but
as
a
sketch
i
am
reminded
of
a
wish
once
expressed
by
a
careful
writer
who
observed
that
he
would
gladly
see
his
works
printed
at
once
as
he
conceived
them
in
order
then
to
go
to
the
task
with
a
fresh
eye
since
everything
defective
presents
itself
to
us
more
obviously
in
print
than
even
in
the
cleanest
manuscript
this
feeling
may
be
imagined
to
be
stronger
in
my
case
since
i
had
not
even
an
opportunity
of
going
through
a
fair
transcript
of
my
work
before
its
publication
these
pages
having
been
put
together
at
a
time
when
a
quiet
collected
state
of
mind
was
out
of
the
question
some
of
the
explanations
i
was
desirous
of
giving
are
to
be
found
in
the
introduction
but
in
the
portion
of
my
work
to
be
devoted
to
the
history
of
the
doctrine
of
colours
i
hope
to
give
a
more
detailed
account
of
my
investigations
and
the
vicissitudes
they
underwent
one
inquiry
however
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
the
consideration
namely
of
the
question
what
can
a
man
accomplish
who
can
not
devote
his
whole
life
to
scientific
pursuits
what
can
he
perform
as
a
temporary
guest
on
an
estate
not
his
own
for
the
advantage
of
the
proprietor
when
we
consider
art
in
its
higher
character
we
might
wish
that
masters
only
had
to
do
with
it
that
scholars
should
be
trained
by
the
severest
study
that
amateurs
might
feel
themselves
happy
in
reverentially
approaching
its
precincts
for
a
work
of
art
should
be
the
effusion
of
genius
the
artist
should
evoke
its
substance
and
form
from
his
inmost
being
treat
his
materials
with
sovereign
command
and
make
use
of
external
influences
only
to
accomplish
his
powers
but
if
the
professor
in
this
case
has
many
reasons
for
respecting
the
dilettante
the
man
of
science
has
every
motive
to
be
still
more
indulgent
since
the
amateur
here
is
capable
of
contributing
what
may
be
satisfactory
and
useful
the
sciences
depend
much
more
on
experiment
than
art
and
for
mere
experiment
many
a
votary
is
qualified
scientific
results
are
arrived
at
by
many
means
and
can
not
dispense
with
many
hands
many
heads
science
may
be
communicated
the
treasure
may
be
inherited
and
what
is
acquired
by
one
may
be
appropriated
by
many
hence
no
one
perhaps
ought
to
be
reluctant
to
offer
his
contributions
how
much
do
we
not
owe
to
accident
to
mere
practice
to
momentary
observation
all
who
are
endowed
only
with
habits
of
attention
women
children
are
capable
of
communicating
striking
and
true
remarks
in
science
it
can
not
therefore
be
required
that
he
who
endeavours
to
furnish
something
in
its
aid
should
devote
his
whole
life
to
it
should
survey
and
investigate
it
in
all
its
extent
for
this
in
most
cases
would
be
a
severe
condition
even
for
the
initiated
but
if
we
look
through
the
history
of
science
in
general
especially
the
history
of
physics
we
shall
find
that
many
important
acquisitions
have
been
made
by
single
inquirers
in
single
departments
and
very
often
by
unprofessional
observers
to
whatever
direction
a
man
may
be
determined
by
inclination
or
accident
whatever
class
of
phenomena
especially
strike
him
excite
his
interest
fix
his
attention
and
occupy
him
the
result
will
still
be
for
the
advantage
of
science
for
every
new
relation
that
comes
to
light
every
new
mode
of
investigation
even
the
imperfect
attempt
even
error
itself
is
available
it
may
stimulate
other
observers
and
is
never
without
its
use
as
influencing
future
inquiry
with
this
feeling
the
author
himself
may
look
back
without
regret
on
his
endeavours
from
this
consideration
he
can
derive
some
encouragement
for
the
prosecution
of
the
remainder
of
his
task
and
although
not
satisfied
with
the
result
of
his
efforts
yet
by
the
sincerity
of
his
intentions
he
ventures
to
recommend
his
past
and
future
labours
to
the
interest
of
his
contemporaries
and

a

marked

kindly
furnished
by
a

note
par
every
treatise
on
the
harmonious
combination
of
colours
contains
the
diagram
of
the
chromatic
circle
more
or
less
elaborately
constructed
these
diagrams
if
intended
to
exhibit
the
contrasts
produced
by
the
action
and
of
the
retina
have
one
common
defect
the
opposite
colours
are
made
equal
in
intensity
whereas
the
complemental
colour
pictured
on
the
retina
is
always
less
vivid
and
always
darker
or
lighter
than
the
original
colour
this
variety
undoubtedly
accords
more
with
harmonious
effects
in
painting
the
opposition
of
two
pure
hues
of
equal
intensity
differing
only
in
the
abstract
quality
of
colour
would
immediately
be
pronounced
crude
and
inharmonious
it
would
not
however
be
strictly
correct
to
say
that
such
a
contrast
is
too
violent
on
the
contrary
it
appears
the
contrast
is
not
carried
far
enough
for
though
differing
in
colour
the
two
hues
may
be
exactly
similar
in
purity
and
intensity
complete
contrast
on
the
other
hand
supposes
dissimilarity
in
all
respects
in
addition
to
the
mere
difference
of
hue
the
eye
it
seems
requires
difference
in
the
lightness
or
darkness
of
the
hue
the
spectrum
of
a
colour
relieved
as
a
dark
on
a
light
ground
is
a
light
colour
on
a
dark
ground
and
thus
if
we
look
at
a
bright
red
wafer
on
the
whitest
surface
the
complemental
image
will
be
still
lighter
than
the
white
surface
if
the
same
wafer
is
placed
on
a
black
surface
the
complemental
image
will
be
still
darker
the
colour
of
both
these
spectra
may
be
called
greenish
but
it
is
evident
that
a
colour
must
be
scarcely
appreciable
as
such
if
it
is
lighter
than
white
and
darker
than
black
it
is
however
to
be
remarked
that
the
white
surface
round
the
light
greenish
image
seems
tinged
with
a
reddish
hue
and
the
black
surface
round
the
dark
image
becomes
slightly
illuminated
with
the
same
colour
thus
in
both
cases
assisting
to
render
the
image
apparent
the
difficulty
or
impossibility
of
describing
degrees
of
colour
in
words
has
also
had
a
tendency
to
mislead
by
conveying
the
idea
of
more
positive
hues
than
the
physiological
contrast
warrants
thus
supposing
scarlet
to
be
relieved
as
a
dark
the
complemental
colour
is
so
light
in
degree
and
so
faint
in
colour
that
it
should
be
called
a
pearly
grey
whereas
the
theorists
looking
at
the
quality
of
colour
abstractedly
would
call
it
a
and
the
diagram
would
falsely
present
such
a
hue
equal
in
intensity
to
scarlet
or
as
nearly
equal
as
possible
even
the
difference
of
mass
which
good
taste
requires
may
be
suggested
by
the
physiological
phenomena
for
unless
the
complemental
image
is
suffered
to
fall
on
a
surface
precisely
as
near
to
the
eye
as
that
on
which
the
original
colour
was
displayed
it
appears
larger
or
smaller
than
the
original
object
and
this
in
a
rapidly
increasing
proportion
lastly
the
shape
itself
soon
becomes
changed
that
vivid
colour
demands
the
comparative
absence
of
colour
either
on
a
lighter
or
darker
scale
as
its
contrast
may
be
inferred
again
from
the
fact
that
bright
colourless
objects
produce
strongly
coloured
spectra
in
darkness
the
spectrum
which
is
first
white
or
nearly
white
is
followed
by
red
in
light
the
spectrum
which
is
first
black
is
followed
by
green
all
colour
as
the
author
observes
is
to
be
considered
as
inasmuch
as
it
is
in
every
case
lighter
than
black
and
darker
than
white
hence
no
contrast
of
colour
with
colour
or
even
of
colour
with
black
or
white
can
be
so
great
as
regards
lightness
or
darkness
as
the
contrast
of
black
and
white
or
light
and
dark
abstractedly
this
distinction
between
the
differences
of
degree
and
the
differences
of
kind
is
important
since
a
just
application
of
contrast
in
colour
may
be
counteracted
by
an
undue
difference
in
lightness
or
darkness
the
mere
contrast
of
colour
is
happily
employed
in
some
of
guido
lighter
pictures
but
if
intense
darks
had
been
opposed
to
his
delicate
carnations
their
comparative
whiteness
would
have
been
unpleasantly
apparent
on
the
other
hand
the
in
giorgione
sebastian
del
piombo
his
best
imitator
and
titian
was
sometimes
so
extremely
glowing
that
the
deepest
colours
and
black
were
indispensable
accompaniments
the
manner
of
titian
as
distinguished
from
his
imitation
of
giorgione
is
golden
rather
than
fiery
and
his
biographers
are
quite
correct
in
saying
that
he
was
fond
of
opposing
red
lake
and
blue
to
his
flesh
the
correspondence
of
these
contrasts
with
the
physiological
phenomena
will
be
immediately
apparent
while
the
occasional
practice
of
rubens
in
opposing
bright
red
to
a
still
cooler
will
be
seen
to
be
equally
consistent
the
effect
of
white
drapery
the
comparative
absence
of
colour
in
enhancing
the
glow
of
titian
has
been
frequently
pointed
out
the
shadows
of
white
thus
opposed
to
flesh
often
present
again
the
physiological
contrast
however
delicately
according
to
the
hue
of
the
carnation
the
lights
on
the
other
hand
are
not
and
probably
never
were
quite
white
but
from
the
first
partook
of
the
quality
of
depth
a
quality
assumed
by
the
colourists
to
pervade
every
part
of
a
picture
more
or
less
it
was
before
observed
that
the
description
of
colours
in
words
may
often
convey
ideas
of
too
positive
a
nature
and
it
may
be
remarked
generally
that
the
colours
employed
by
the
great
masters
are
in
their
ultimate
effect
more
or
less
subdued
or
broken
the
physiological
contrasts
are
however
still
applicable
in
the
most
comparatively
neutral
scale
again
the
works
of
the
colourists
show
that
these
oppositions
are
not
confined
to
large
masses
except
perhaps
in
works
to
be
seen
only
at
a
great
distance
on
the
contrary
they
are
more
or
less
apparent
in
every
part
and
when
at
last
the
direct
and
intentional
operations
of
the
artist
may
have
been
insufficient
to
produce
them
in
their
minuter
degrees
the
accidental
results
of
glazing
and
other
methods
may
be
said
to
extend
the
contrasts
to
infinity
in
such
productions
where
every
smallest
portion
is
an
epitome
of
the
whole
the
eye
still
appreciates
the
fascinating
effect
of
contrast
and
the
work
is
pronounced
to
be
true
and
complete
in
the
best
sense
of
the
words
the
venetian
method
of
scumbling
and
glazing
exhibits
these
minuter
contrasts
within
each
other
and
is
thus
generally
considered
more
refined
than
the
system
of
breaking
the
colours
since
it
ensures
a
fuller
gradation
of
hues
and
produces
another
class
of
contrasts
those
namely
which
result
from
degrees
of
transparence
and
opacity
in
some
of
the
flemish
and
dutch
masters
and
sometimes
in
reynolds
the
two
methods
are
combined
in
great
perfection
the
chromatic
diagram
does
not
appear
to
be
older
than
the
last
century
it
is
one
of
those
happy
adaptations
of
exacter
principles
to
the
objects
of
taste
which
might
have
been
expected
from
leonardo
da
vinci
that
its
true
principle
was
duly
felt
is
abundantly
evident
from
the
works
of
the
colourists
as
well
as
from
the
general
observations
of
early
writers
the
more
practical
directions
occasionally
to
be
met
with
in
the
treatises
of
leon
battista
alberti
leonardo
da
vinci
and
others
are
conformable
to
the
same
system
some
italian
works
not
written
by
painters
which
pretend
to
describe
this
harmony
are
however
very
imperfect
a
passage
in

on
colours
is
perhaps
the
only
one
worth
quoting

the
reputation

some

if
the
above
passage
may
be
traced
to
the

it
must
be
confessed
that
it
is
almost
the
only
one
of
the

note
par
in
some
of
these
cases
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
goethe
attributes
the
contrast
too
exclusively
to
the
physiological
cause
without
making
sufficient
allowance
for
the
actual
difference
in
the
colour
of
the
lights
the
purely
physical
nature
of
some
coloured
shadows
was
pointed
out
by
pohlmann
and
eckermann
took
some
pains
to
convince
goethe
of
the
necessity
of
making
such
a
distinction
goethe
at
first
adhered
to
his
extreme
view
but
some
time
afterwards
confessed
to
eckermann
that
in
the
case
of
the
blue
shadows
of
snow
the
reflection
of
the
sky
was
undoubtedly
to
be
taken
into
the
account
both
causes
may
however
operate
together
he
observed
and
the
contrast
which
a
warm
yellow
light
demands
may
heighten
the
effect
of
the
blue
this
was
all
his
opponent
contended
with
a
few
such
exceptions
the
general
theory
of
goethe
with
regard
to
coloured
shadows
is
undoubtedly
correct
the
experiments
with
two
candles
and
with
coloured
glass
and
fluids
as
well
as
the
observations
on
the
shadows
of
snow
are
conclusive
for
in
all
these
cases
only
one
light
is
actually
changed
in
colour
while
the
other
still
assumes
the
complemental
hue
coloured
shadows
müller
observes
are
usually
ascribed
to
the
physiological
influence
of
contrast
the
complementary
colour
presented
by
the
shadow
being
regarded
as
the
effect
of
internal
causes
acting
on
that
part
of
the
retina
and
not
of
the
impression
of
coloured
rays
from
without
this
explanation
is
the
one
adopted
by
rumford
goethe
grotthuss
brandes
tourtual
pohlmann
and
most
authors
who
have
studied
the
subject
in
the
historical
part
the
author
gives
an
account
of
a
scarce
french
work

note
par
this
opinion
of
the
author
is
frequently
repeated
and
as
it
seems
at
first
sight
to
be
at
variance
with
a
received
principle
of
art
it
may
be
as
well
at
once
to
examine
it
in
order
to
see
the
general
proposition
in
its
true
point
of
view
it
will
be
necessary
to
forget
the
arbitrary
distinctions
of
light
and
shade
and
to
consider
all
such
modifications
between
highest
brightness
and
absolute
darkness
only
as
so
many
lesser
degrees
of
light
the
author
indeed
by
the
word
shadow
always
understands
a
lesser
light
the
received
notion
as
stated
by
du
fresnoy
is
much
too
positive
and
unconditional
and
is
only
true
when
we
understand
the
displaying
light
to
comprehend
certain
degrees
of
half
or
reflected
light
and
the
destroying
shade
to
mean
the
intensest
degree
of
obscurity
there
are
degrees
of
brightness
which
destroy
colour
as
well
as
degrees
of
darkness
in
general
colour
resides
in
a
mitigated
light
but
a
very
little
observation
shows
us
that
different
colours
require
different
degrees
of
light
to
display
them
leonardo
da
vinci
frequently
inculcates
the
general
principle
above
alluded
to
but
he
as
frequently
qualifies
it
for
he
not
only
remarks
that
the
highest
light
may
be
comparative
privation
of
colour
but
observes
with
great
truth
that
some
hues
are
best
displayed
in
their
fully
illumined
parts
some
in
their
reflections
and
some
in
their
and
again
that
every
colour
is
most
beautiful
when
lit
by
reflections
from
its
own
surface
or
from
a
hue
similar
to
its
own
the
venetians
went
further
than
leonardo
in
this
view
and
practice
and
he
seems
to
allude
to
them
when
he
criticises
certain
painters
who
in
aiming
at
clearness
and
fulness
of
colour
neglected
what
in
his
eyes
was
of
superior
importance
namely
gradation
and
force
of
that
increase
of
colour
supposes
increase
of
darkness
as
so
often
stated
by
goethe
may
be
granted
without
difficulty
to
what
extent
on
the
other
hand
increase
of
darkness
or
rather
diminution
of
light
is
accompanied
by
increase
of
colour
is
a
question
which
has
been
variously
answered
by
various
schools
examples
of
the
total
negation
of
the
principle
are
not
wanting
nor
are
they
confined
to
the
infancy
of
the
art
instances
again
of
the
opposite
tendency
are
frequent
in
venetian
and
early
flemish
pictures
resembling
the
augmenting
richness
of
gems
or
of
stained
glass
indeed
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
increase
of
colour
in
shade
which
is
so
remarkable
in
the
pictures
alluded
to
may
have
been
originally
suggested
by
the
rich
and
fascinating
effect
of
stained
glass
and
the
venetians
in
this
as
in
many
other
respects
may
have
improved
on
a
hint
borrowed
from
the
early
german
painters
many
of
whom
painted
on
glass
at
all
events
the
principle
of
still
increasing
in
colour
in
certain
hues
seems
to
have
been
adopted
in
flanders
and
in
venice
at
an
early
period
while
giorgione
in
carrying
the
style
to
the
most
daring
extent
still
recommended
it
by
corresponding
grandeur
of
treatment
in
other
respects
the
same
general
tendency
except
that
the
technical
methods
are
less
transparent
is
however
very
striking
in
some
of
the
painters
of
the
school
of
umbria
the
instructors
or
early
companions
of
raphael
the
influence
of
these
examples
as
well
as
that
of
fra
bartolommeo
in
florence
is
distinctly
to
be
traced
in
the
works
of
the
great
artist
just
named
but
neither
is
so
marked
as
the
effect
of
his
emulation
of
a
venetian
painter
at
a
later
period
the
glowing
colour
sometimes
bordering
on
exaggeration
which
raphael
adopted
in
rome
is
undoubtedly
to
be
attributed
to
the
rivalry
of
sebastian
del
piombo
this
painter
the
best
of
giorgione
imitators
arrived
in
rome
invited
by
agostini
chigi
in
and
the
most
powerful
of
raphael
frescoes
the
heliodorus
and
mass
of
bolsena
as
well
as
some
portraits
in
the
same
style
were
painted
in
the
two
following
years
in
the
hands
of
some
of
raphael
scholars
again
this
extreme
warmth
was
occasionally
carried
to
excess
particularly
by
pierino
del
vaga
with
whom
it
often
degenerated
into
redness
the
representative
of
the
glowing
manner
in
florence
was
fra
bartolommeo
and
in
the
same
quality
considered
abstractedly
some
painters
of
the
school
of
ferrara
were
second
to
none
in
another
note
par
some
further
considerations
are
offered
which
may
partly
explain
the
prevalence
of
this
style
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
here
we
merely
add
that
the
conditions
under
which
the
appearance
itself
is
most
apparent
in
nature
are
perhaps
more
obvious
in
venice
than
elsewhere
the
colour
of
general
nature
may
be
observed
in
all
places
with
almost
equal
convenience
but
with
regard
to
an
important
quality
in
living
nature
namely
the
colour
of
flesh
perhaps
there
are
no
circumstances
in
which
its
effects
at
different
distances
can
be
so
conveniently
compared
as
when
the
observer
and
the
observed
gradually
approach
and
glide
past
each
other
on
so
smooth
an
element
and
in
so
undisturbed
a
manner
as
on
the
canals
and
in
the
gondolas
of
venice
the
complexions
from
the
peculiar
mellow
carnations
of
the
italian
women
to
the
features
and
limbs
of
the
mariners
presenting
at
the
same
time
the
fullest
variety
in
another
sense
at
a
certain
distance
the
colour
being
always
assumed
to
be
unimpaired
by
interposed
atmosphere
the
reflections
appear
kindled
to
intenser
warmth
the
fiery
glow
of
giorgione
is
strikingly
apparent
the
colour
is
seen
in
its
largest
relation
the
an
expression
so
emphatically
used
by
italian
writers
appears
in
all
its
quantity
and
the
reflections
being
the
focus
of
warmth
the
hue
seems
to
deepen
in
shade
a
nearer
view
gives
the
detail
of
cooler
tints
more
perceptibly
and
the
forms
are
at
the
same
time
more
distinct
hence
lanzi
is
quite
correct
when
in
distinguishing
the
style
of
titian
from
that
of
giorgione
he
says
that
titian
was
at
once
more
defined
and
less
fiery
in
a
still
nearer
observation
the
eye
detects
the
minute
lights
which
leonardo
da
vinci
says
are
incompatible
with
effects
such
as
those
we
have
described
and
which
accordingly
we
never
find
in
giorgione
and
titian
this
large
impression
of
colour
which
seems
to
require
the
condition
of
comparative
distance
for
its
full
effect
was
most
fitly
employed
by
the
same
great
artists
in
works
painted
in
the
open
air
or
for
large
their
celebrated
frescoes
on
the
exterior
of
the
fondaco
de
tedeschi
at
venice
to
judge
from
their
faint
remains
and
the
descriptions
of
earlier
writers
were
remarkable
for
extreme
warmth
in
the
shadows
the
old
frescoes
in
the
open
air
throughout
friuli
have
often
the
same
character
and
owing
to
the
fulness
of
effect
which
this
treatment
ensures
are
conspicuous
at
a
very
great
distance
in
assuming
that
the
venetian
painters
may
have
acquired
a
taste
for
this
breadth
of
colour
under
the
circumstances
above
alluded
to
it
is
moreover
to
be
remembered
that
the
time
for
this
agreeable
study
was
the
evening
when
the
sun
had
already
set
behind
the
hills
of
bassano
when
the
light
was
glowing
but
diffused
when
shadows
were
soft
conditions
all
agreeing
with
the
character
of
their
colouring
above
all
when
the
hour
invited
the
fairer
portion
of
the
population
to
betake
themselves
in
their
gondolas
to
the
lagunes
the
scene
of
this
promenade
was
to
the
north
of
venice
the
quarter
in
which
titian
at
one
time
lived
a
letter
exists
written
by
francesco
priscianese
giving
an
account
of
his
supping
with
the
great
painter
in
company
with
jacopo
nardi
pietro
aretino
the
sculptor
sansovino
and
others
the
writer
speaks
of
the
beauty
of
the
garden
where
the
table
was
prepared
looking
over
the
lagunes
towards
murano
which
part
of
the
sea
he
continues
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
down
was
covered
with
a
thousand
gondolas
graced
with
beautiful
women
and
enlivened
by
the
harmony
of
voices
and
instruments
which
lasted
till
midnight
forming
a
pleasing
accompaniment
to
our
cheerful
repast
to
return
to
goethe
perhaps
the
foregoing
remarks
may
warrant
the
conclusion
that
his
idea
of
colour
in
shadow
is
not
irreconcileable
with
the
occasional
practice
of
the
best
painters
the
highest
examples
of
the
style
thus
defined
are
or
were
to
be
found
in
the
works
of
giorgione
and
titian
and
hence
the
style
itself
though
within
that
circle
few
dare
walk
is
to
be
considered
the
grandest
and
most
perfect
its
possible
defects
or
abuse
are
not
to
be
dissembled
in
addition
to
the
danger
of
exaggeration
it
is
seldom
united
with
the
plenitude
of
light
and
shade
or
with
roundness
yet
where
fine
examples
of
both
modes
of
treatment
may
be
compared
the
charm
of
colour
has
perhaps
the
advantage
the
difficulty
of
uniting
qualities
so
different
in
their
nature
is
proved
by
the
very
rare
instances
in
which
it
has
been
accomplished
tintoret
in
endeavouring
to
add
to
venetian
colour
in
almost
every
instance
fell
short
of
the
glowing
richness
of
titian
giacomo
bassan
and
his
imitators
even
in
their
dark
effects
still
had
the
principle
of
the
gem
in
view
their
light
in
certain
hues
is
the
minimum
of
colour
their
lower
tones
are
rich
their
darks
intense
and
all
is
sparkling

this

striking

absolute
opacity
to
judge
from
the
older

seems
to
have

inadmissible
the

to
admit
light
however
modified
and
varied
in
the
form
prescribed
by
the
architect
and
that
form
was
to
be
preserved
this
has
been
unfortunately
lost
sight

in
some
modern
which
by
excluding
the
light
in
large
masses
and
adopting
the
opacity
of

the
reverse
of
the
influence
above
alluded
to
has
interfered
with
the
architectural
symmetry
in
a
manner
far
from
desirable
on
the
other
hand
if
we
suppose
painting
at
any
period
to
have
aimed
at
the
imitation
of
stained
glass
such
an
imitation
must
of
necessity
have
led
to
extreme
force
for
the
painter
sets
out
by
substituting
a
mere
white
ground
for
the
real
light
of
the
sky
and
would
thus
be
compelled
to
subdue
every
tone
accordingly
in
such
an
imitation
his
colour
would
soon
deepen
to
its
intensest
state
indeed
considerable
portions
of
the
darker
hues
would
be
lost
in
obscurity
the
early
flemish
pictures
seldom
err
on
the
side
of
a
gay
superabundance
of
colour
on
the
contrary
they
are
generally
remarkable
for
comparatively
cool
lights
for
extreme
depth
and
a

also
to
be
taken
into
the
account

extremely
dark

the

case
of
the
phenomenon
which
goethe
calls
a

and
one
which
at
once
explains

is
the
following
regard
a

wafer
on
a
sheet
of

paper
keeping
the
eye
stedfastly
fixed
on
a
point
at
its
center
when
the
retina
is
fatigued
withdraw
the
head
a
little
from
the
paper
and
a
green
halo
will
appear
to
surround
the
wafer
by
this
slight
increase
of
distance
the
image
of
the
wafer
itself
on
the
retina
becomes
smaller
and
the
ocular
spectrum
which
before
coincided
with
the
direct
image
being
now
relatively
larger
is
seen
as
a
surrounding

cases
of
this
kind

does
not
class
them
with

careful
investigation
has
however
shown
that
this
defect
of
vision
arises
in
most
if
not
in
all
cases
from
an
inability
to
perceive
the
red
not
the
blue

the

are
so
confounded
by

affected

the
author
more
than
once
admits
that
this
chapter
on
pathological
colours
is
very
incomplete
and
expresses
a
wish
par
that
some
medical
physiologists
would
investigate
the
subject
further
this
was
afterwards
in
a
great
degree
accomplished
by
johannes
müller

the
reader
may
consult
scott

on
demonology

the
instances
adduced
by
müller

others
are
however
intended
to
prove
the
inherent
capacity
of
the
organ
of
vision
to
produce
light
and
colours
in
some
maladies
of
the
eye
the
patient
it
seems
suffers
the
constant
presence
of
light
without
external
light
the
exciting
principle
in
this
case
is
thus
proved
to
be
within
and
the
conclusion
of
the
physiologists
is
that
external
light
is
only
one
of
the
causes
which
produce
luminous
and
coloured
impressions
that
this
view
was
anticipated
by
newton
may
be
gathered
from
the
concluding
query
in

thus
described

leading
phenomena
as
seen
by
him
in
the
alps
at
a
distance
of
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
at
in
bright
sunshine
the
snow
appeared
yellow
or
even
reddish
while
the
dark
parts
of
the
mountain
free
from
snow
were
of
the
most
decided
blue
the
appearances
did
not
surprise
me
for
i
could
have
predicted
that
the
mass
of
the
interposed
medium
would
give
a
deep
yellow
tone
to
the
white
snow
but
i
was
pleased
to
witness
the
effect
since
it
so
entirely
contradicted
the
erroneous
views
of
some
philosophers
who
assert
that
the
air
has
a
quality
the
observation
said
goethe
is
of
importance
and
contradicts
the
error
you
allude
to
completely
the
same
writer
has
some
observations
to
the
same
effect
on
the
colour
of
the
rhone
at
geneva
a
circumstance
of
an
amusing
nature
which
he
relates
in
confirmation
of
goethe
theory
deserves
to
be
inserted
here
at
strasburg
passing
by
a
shop
i
saw
a
little
glass
bust
of
napoleon
which
relieved
as
it
was
against
the
dark
interior
of
the
room
exhibited
every
gradation
of
blue
from
milky
light
blue
to
deep
violet
i
foresaw
that
the
bust
seen
from
within
the
shop
with
the
light
behind
it
would
present
every
degree
of
yellow
and
i
could
not
resist
walking
in
and
addressing
the
owner
though
perfectly
unknown
to
me
my
first
glance
was
directed
to
the
bust
in
which
to
my
great
joy
i
saw
at
once
the
most
brilliant
colours
of
the
warmer
kind
from
the
palest
yellow
to
dark
ruby
red
i
eagerly
asked
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
purchase
the
bust
the
owner
replied
that
he
had
only
lately
brought
it
with
him
from
paris
from
a
similar
attachment
to
the
emperor
to
that
which
i
appeared
to
feel
but
as
my
ardour
seemed
far
to
surpass
his
i
deserved
to
possess
it
so
invaluable
did
this
treasure
seem
in
my
eyes
that
i
could
not
help
looking
at
the
good
man
with
wonder
as
he
put
the
bust
into
my
hands
for
a
few
franks
i
sent
it
together
with
a
curious
medal
which
i
had
bought
in
milan
as
a
present
to
goethe
and
when
at
frankfort
received
the
following
letter
from
him
the
letter
which
eckermann
gives
entire
thus
concludes
when
you
return
to
weimar
you
shall
see
the
bust
in
bright
sunshine
and
while
the
transparent
countenance
exhibits
a
quiet
blue
the
thick
mass
of
the
breast
and
epaulettes
glows
with
every
gradation
of
warmth
from
the
most
powerful
downwards
and
as
the
granite
statue
of
memnon
uttered
harmonious
sounds
so
the
dim
glass
image
displays
itself
in
the
pomp
of
colours
the
hero
is
victorious
still
in
supporting
the
farbenlehre
one
effect
of
goethe
theory
has
been
to
invite
the
attention
of
scientific
men
to
facts
and
appearances
which
had
before
been
unnoticed
or
unexplained
to
the
above
cases
may
be
added
the
very
common
but
very
important
fact
in
painting
that
a
light
warm
colour
passed
in
a
state
over
a
dark
one
produces
a
cold
bluish
hue
while
the
operation
reversed
produces
extreme
warmth
on
the
judicious
application
of
both
these
effects
but
especially
of
the
latter
the
richness
and
brilliancy
of
the
pictures
greatly
depends
the
principle
is
to
be
recognised
in
the
productions
of
schools
apparently
opposite
in
their
methods
thus
the
practice
of
leaving
the
ground
through
which
a
light
colour
is
apparent
as
a
means
of
ensuring
warmth
and
depth
is
very
common
among
the
dutch
and
flemish
painters
the
italians
again
who
preferred
a
solid
speak
of
internal
light
as
the
most
fascinating
quality
in
colour
when
the
ground
is
entirely
covered
by
solid
painting
as
in
the
works
of
some
colourists
the
warmest
tints
in
shadows
and
reflections
have
been
found
necessary
to
represent
it
this
was
the
practice
of
rembrandt
frequently
and
of
reynolds
universally
but
the
glow
of
their
general
colour
is
still
owing
to
its
being
repeatedly
or
ultimately
enriched
on
the
above
principle
lastly
the
works
of
those
masters
who
were
accustomed
to
paint
on
dark
grounds
are
often
heavy
and
opaque
and
even
where
this
influence
of
the
ground
was
overcome
the
effects
of
time
must
be
constantly
diminishing
the
warmth
of
their
colouring
as
the
surface
becomes
rubbed
and
the
dark
ground
more
apparent
through
it
the
practice
of
painting
on
dark
grounds
was
intended
by
the
carracci
to
compel
the
students
of
their
school
to
aim
at
the
direct
imitation
of
the
model
and
to
acquire
the
use
of
the
brush
for
the
dark
ground
could
only
be
overcome
by
very
solid
painting
the
result
answered
their
expectations
as
far
as
dexterity
of
pencil
was
concerned
but
the
method
was
fatal
to
brilliancy
of
colour
an
intelligent
writer
of
the
seventeenth
century
relates
that
guido
adopted
his
extremely
light
style
from
seeing
the
rapid
change
in
some
works
of
the
carracci
soon
after
they
were
done
it
is
important
however
to
remark
that
guido
remedy
was
external
rather
than
internal
brilliancy
and
it
is
evident
that
so
powerless
a
brightness
as
white
paint
can
only
acquire
the
splendour
of
light
by
great
contrast
and
above
all
by
being
seen
through
external
darkness
the
secret
of
van
eyck
and
his
contemporaries
is
always
assumed
to
consist
in
the
vehicle
varnish
or
oils
he
employed
but
a
far
more
important
condition
of
the
splendour
of
colour
in
the
works
of
those
masters
was
the
careful
preservation
of
internal
light
by
painting
thinly
but
ultimately
with
great
force
on
white
grounds
in
some
of
the
early
flemish
pictures
in
the
royal
gallery
at
munich
it
may
be
observed
that
wherever
an
alteration
was
made
by
the
painter
so
that
a
light
colour
is
painted
over
a
dark
one
the
colour
is
as
opaque
as
in
any
of
the
more
modern
pictures
which
are
generally
contrasted
with
such
works
no
quality
in
the
vehicle
could
prevent
this
opacity
under
such
circumstances
and
on
the
other
hand
provided
the
internal
splendour
is
by
any
means
preserved
the
vehicle
is
comparatively
unimportant
it
matters
not
say
the
authorities
on
these
points
whether
the
effect
in
question
is
attained
by
painting
thinly
over
the
ground
in
the
manner
of
the
early
flemish
painters
and
sometimes
of
rubens
or
by
painting
a
solid
light
preparation
to
be
afterwards
toned
to
richness
in
the
manner
of
the
venetians
among
the
mechanical
causes
of
the
clearness
of
colours
superposed
on
a
light
preparation
may
be
mentioned
that
of
careful
grinding
all
writers
on
art
who
have
descended
to
practical
details
have
insisted
on
this
from
the
appearance
of
some
venetian
pictures
it
may
be
conjectured
that
the
colours
of
the
solid
were
sometimes
less
perfectly
ground
than
the
scumbling
colours
the
light
having
to
pass
through
the
one
and
to
be
reflected
from
the
other
the
flemish
painters
appear
to
have
used
pigments
universally
this
is
very
evident
in
flemish
copies
from
raphael
which
though
equally
impasted
with
the
originals
are
to
be
detected
among
other
indications
by
the
colours
employed

it
is
to
be
observed
that

of

again
with
those
of

himself
admits
and
it
has
been
remarked
by
others
that
his
theory
in
many
respects
closely
resembles
that
of
aristotle
indeed
he
confesses
that
at
one
time
he
had
an
intention
of
merely
paraphrasing
that
philosopher
treatise
on
colours
we
have
already
remarked
note
on
par
that
goethe
notion
with
regard
to
the
production
of
warm
colours
by
the
interposition
of
dark
transparent
mediums
before
a
light
ground
agrees
with
the
practice
of
the
best
schools
in
colouring
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
same
reasons
which
may
make
this
part
of
the
doctrine
generally
acceptable
to
artists
now
may
have
recommended
the
very
similar
theory
of
aristotle
to
the
painters
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
at
all
events
it
appears
that
the
ancient
theory
was
known
to
those
painters
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
on
the
fact
that
the
doctrines
of
aristotle
were
enthusiastically
embraced
and
generally
inculcated
at
the
period
in
question
but
it
has
not
been
observed
that
the
italian
writers
who
translated
paraphrased
and
commented
on

in
particular
were
in
several
instances
the
personal

be

circumstances

at

on
the
aristotelian
doctrines
early
in

the

were

tacitly

or
openly
profess
to
explain
it
it
is
true
this
is
not
always
done
in
the
clearest
manner
and
some
of
these
writers
might
say
with
lodovico

i
speak
of

not
as
a

would
be

original
genius

now
and
then
alludes
generally
to
opinions
of

but
he
quotes
no
authority
ancient
or
modern
nevertheless
a
passage
on
the
nature
of
colours
particularly
where
he
speaks
of
the
colours
of
the
elements
appears
to
be
copied
from
leon
battista
alberti
and
from
the
mode
in
which
some
of
propositions
are
stated
it
has
been
supposed
that
he
had
been
accustomed
at
florence
to
the
form
of
the
aristotelian
philosophy
at
all
events
some
of
the
most
important
of
his
observations
respecting
light
and
colours
have
a
great
analogy
with
those
contained
in
the
treatise
in
question
the
following
examples
will
be
sufficient
to
prove
this
coincidence

corresponding
passages
in

indicated

its

it

the

is
affected
by

accumulated
state
however
it

the

quite

leonardo
the
blue
of
the

is
owing
to
the
mass
of

interposed
between

the

aristotle
we
see
no
colour
in
its
pure
state
but
every
hue
is
variously
intermingled
with
others
even
when
it
is
uninfluenced
by
other
colours
the
effect
of
light
and
shade
modifies
it
in
various
ways
so
that
it
undergoes
alterations
and
appears
unlike
itself
thus
bodies
seen
in

or
in
light

more
pronounced
or
softer
with
their
surfaces
inclined
this
way
or
that
with

change

a
different

leonardo
no
substance
will
ever
exhibit
its
own
hue
unless
the
light
which
illumines
it
is
entirely
similar
in
colour
it
very
rarely
happens
that
the
shadows
of
opaque
bodies
are
really
similar
in
colour
to
the
illumined
parts
the
surface
of
every
substance
partakes
of
as
many
hues
as
are
reflected
from
surrounding
objects
aristotle
so
again
with
regard
to
the
light
of
fire
of
the
moon
or
of
lamps
each
has
a
different
colour
which
is
variously
combined
with
differently
coloured
objects
leonardo
we
can
scarcely
ever
say
that
the
surface
of
illumined
bodies
exhibits
the
real
colour
of
those
bodies
take
a
white
band
and
place
it
in
the
dark
and
let
it
receive
light
by
means
of
three
apertures
from
the
sun
from
fire
and
from
the
sky
the
white
band
will
be
tricoloured
aristotle
when
the
light
falls
on
any
object
and
assumes
for
example
a
red
or
green
tint
it
is
again
reflected
on
other
substances
thus
undergoing
a
new
change
but
this
effect
though
it
really
takes
place
is
not
appreciable
by
the
eye
though
the
light
thus
reflected
to
the
eye
is
composed
of
a
variety
of
colours
the
principal
of
these
only
are
distinguishable
leonardo
no
colour
reflected
on
the
surface
of
another
colour
tinges
that
surface
with
its
own
colour
merely
but
will
be
mixed
with
various
other
reflections
impinging
on
the
same
surface
but
such
effects
he
observes
elsewhere
are
scarcely
if
at
all
distinguishable
in
a
very
diffused
light
aristotle
thus
all
combinations
of
colours
are
owing
to
three
causes
the
light
the
medium
through
which
the
light
appears
such
as
water
or
air
and
lastly
the
local
colour
from
which
the
light
happens
to
be
reflected
leonardo
all
illumined
objects
partake
of
the
colour
of
the
light
they
receive
every
opaque
surface
partakes
of
the
colour
of
the
intervening
transparent
medium
according
to
the
density
of
such
medium
and
the
distance
between
the
eye
and
the
object
the
medium
is
of
two
kinds
either
it
has
a
surface
like
water
or
it
is
without
a
common
surface
like
the
air
in
the
observations
on
trees
and
plants
more
points
of
resemblance
might
be
quoted
the
passages
corresponding
with
goethe
views
are
much
more
numerous
it
is
remarkable
that
leonardo
in
opposition
it
seems
to
some
authorities
agrees
with
aristotle
in
reckoning
black
and
white
as
colours
placing
them
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
scale
like
aristotle
again
he
frequently
makes
use
of
the
term
black
for
obscurity
he
even
goes
further
for
he
seems
to
consider
that
blue
may
be
produced
by
the
actual
mixture
of
black
and
white
provided
they
are
pure
the
ancient
author
however
explains
himself
on
this
point
as
follows
we
must
not
attempt
to
make
our
observations
on
these
effects
by
mixing
colours
as
painters
mix
them
but
by
remarking
the
appearances
as
produced
by
the
rays
of
light
mingling
with
each
other
when
we
consider
that
leonardo
treatise
professes
to
embrace
the
subject
of
imitation
in
painting
and
that
aristotle
briefly
examines
the
physical
nature
and
appearance
of
colours
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
latter
sustains
the
above
comparison
with
advantage
and
it
is
somewhat
extraordinary
that
observations
indicating
so
refined
a
knowledge
of
nature
as
regards
the
picturesque
should
not
have
been
taken
into
the
account
for
such
appears
to
be
the
fact
in
the
various
opinions
and
conjectures
that
have
been
expressed
from
time
to
time
on
the
painting
of
the
greeks
the
treatise
in
question
must
have
been
written
when
apelles
painted
or
immediately
before
and
as
a
proof
that
aristotle
remarks
on
the
effect
of
mediums
were
not
lost
on
the
artists
of
his
time
the
following
passage
from
pliny
is
subjoined
for
though
it
is
well
known
it
acquires
additional
interest
from
the
foregoing
extracts
he
apelles
passed
a
dark
colour
over
his
pictures
when
finished
so
thin
that
it
increased
the
splendour
of
the
tints
while
it
protected
the
surface
from
dust
and
dirt
it
could
only
be
seen
on
looking
into
the
picture
the
effect
of
this
operation
judiciously
managed
was
to
prevent
the
colours
from
being
too
glaring
and
to
give
the
spectator
the
impression
of
looking
through
a
transparent
crystal
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
almost
imperceptibly
to
add
a
certain
dignity
of
tone
to
colours
that
were
too
florid
this
says
reynolds
is
a
true
and
description
of
glazing
or
scumbling
such
as
was
practised
by
titian
and
the
rest
of
the
venetian
painters
the
account
of
pliny
has
in
this
instance
internal
evidence
of
truth
but
it
is
fully
confirmed
by
the
following
passage
in
aristotle
another
mode
in
which
the
effect
of
colours
is
exhibited
is
when
they
appear
through
each
other
as
painters
employ
them
when
they
glaze
ἐπαλειφοντες
a
dark
colour
over
a
lighter
one
just
as
the
sun
which
is
in
itself
white
assumes
a
red
colour
when
seen
through
darkness
and
smoke
this
operation
also
ensures
a
variety
of
colours
for
there
will
be
a
certain
ratio
between
those
which
are
on
the
surface
and
those
which
are
in
depth
sensu
et
aristotle
notion
respecting
the
derivation
of
colours
from
white
and
black
may
perhaps
be
illustrated
by
the
following
opinion
on
the
very
similar
theory
of
goethe
goethe
and
seebeck
regard
colour
as
resulting
from
the
mixture
of
white
and
black
and
ascribe
to
the
different
colours
a
quality
of
darkness
σκιερὸν
by
the
different
degrees
of
which
they
are
distinguished
passing
from
white
to
black
through
the
gradations
of
yellow
orange
red
violet
and
blue
while
green
appears
to
be
intermediate
again
between
yellow
and
blue
this
remark
though
it
has
no
influence
in
weakening
the
theory
of
colours
proposed
by
newton
is
certainly
correct
having
been
confirmed
experimentally
by
the
researches
of
herschell
who
ascertained
the
relative
intensity
of
the
different
coloured
rays
by
illuminating
objects
under
the
microscope
by
their
means
another
certain
proof
of
the
difference
in
brightness
of
the
different
coloured
rays
is
afforded
by
the
phenomena
of
ocular
spectra
if
after
gazing
at
the
sun
the
eyes
are
closed
so
as
to
exclude
the
light
the
image
of
the
sun
appears
at
first
as
a
luminous
or
white
spectrum
upon
a
dark
ground
but
it
gradually
passes
through
the
series
of
colours
to
black
that
is
to
say
until
it
can
no
longer
be
distinguished
from
the
dark
field
of
vision
and
the
colours
which
it
assumes
are
successively
those
intermediate
between
white
and
black
in
the
order
of
their
illuminating
power
or
brightness
namely
yellow
orange
red
violet
and
blue
if
on
the
other
hand
after
looking
for
some
time
at
the
sun
we
turn
our
eyes
towards
a
white
surface
the
image
of
the
sun
is
seen
at
first
as
a
black
spectrum
upon
the
white
surface
and
gradually
passes
through
the
different
colours
from
the
darkest
to
the
lightest
and
at
last
becomes
white
so
that
it
can
no
longer
be
distinguished
from
the
white
surface
see
par
it
is
not
impossible
that
aristotle
enumeration
of
the
colours
may
have
been
derived
from
or
confirmed
by
this
very
experiment
speaking
of
the
of
colours
he
says
the
impression
not
only
exists
in
the
sensorium
in
the
act
of
perceiving
but
remains
when
the
organ
is
at
rest
thus
if
we
look
long
and
intently
on
any
object
when
we
change
the
direction
of
the
eyes
a
responding
colour
follows
if
we
look
at
the
sun
or
any
other
very
bright
object
and
afterwards
shut
our
eyes
we
shall
as
if
in
ordinary
vision
first
see
a
colour
of
the
same
kind
this
will
presently
be
changed
to
a
red
colour
then
to
purple
and
so
on
till
it
ends
in
black
and
disappears

there

concur

light

but
he
soon
loses
this
clue
to
the

when
he
has
to
speak

evidently
understands
it
in

accordingly
like
lodovico

he
proceeds
to
a
subject
where
he
was
more
at
home
namely
the
symbolical
meaning
of
colours
this
word
is
only
strictly
applied
to
unctuous
substances
and
may
confirm
the
views
of
those

have
conjectured

answered
the
objection

diagram
in
the
plates
to
the

in
this
he
undertakes
to
show
that
the
assumed
gradual
correction
of
the
colours
would
produce
results

from
the
actual

goethe
tells
us
by
an
observation
of
antonius
lucas
of
lüttich
one
of
opponents
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
author
one
of
the
few
who
made
any
objections
lucas
remarks
that
the
sun
acts
merely
as
a
circumscribed
image
in
the
prismatic
experiments
and
that
if
the
same
sun
had
a
lighter
background
than
itself
the
colours
of
the
prism
would
be
reversed
thus
in
goethe
experiments
when
the
grey
disk
is
on
a
dark
ground
it
is
edged
with
blue
on
being
magnified
when
on
a
light
ground
it
is
edged
with
yellow
goethe
acknowledges
that
lucas
had
in
some
measure
anticipated
his
own
vol
ii
note
par
the
earnestness
and
pertinacity
with
which
goethe
insisted
that
the
different
colours
are
not
subject
to
different
degrees
of
refrangibility
are
at
least
calculated
to
prove
that
he
was
himself
convinced
on
the
subject
and
however
extraordinary
it
may
seem
his
conviction
appears
to
have
been
the
result
of
infinite
experiments
and
the
fullest
ocular
evidence
he
returns
to
the
question
in
the
controversial
division
of
his
work
in
the
historical
part
and
again
in
the
description
of
the
plates
in
the
first
he
endeavours
to
show
that
newton
experiment
with
the
blue
and
red
paper
depends
entirely
on
the
colours
being
so
contrived
as
to
appear
elongated
or
curtailed
by
the
prismatic
borders
if
he
says
we
take
a
instead
of
a
dark
one
the
illusion
in
the
latter
case
is
at
once
evident
according
to
the
newtonian
theory
the
red
is
the
least
refrangible
colour
the
violet
the
most
refrangible
why
then
does
newton
place
a
blue
paper
instead
of
a
violet
next
the
red
if
the
fact
were
as
he
states
it
the
difference
in
the
refrangibility
of
the
and
violet
would
be
greater
than
in
the
case
of
the
and
blue
but
here
comes
in
the
circumstance
that
a
violet
paper
conceals
the
prismatic
borders
less
than
a
paper
as
every
observer
may
now
easily
convince
himself

another
experiment
proposed
by
him
to
show
the
unsoundness
of
the
doctrine
of

refrangibility
was
the
following
let
a
tin
plate
painted
with
the
prismatic

in
stripes
be
placed
in
an
empty
cubical
vessel
so
that
from

colours
may
be
just
hidden
by
the
rim
on
pouring
water
into

vessel
all
the
colours
become
visible
in

same
degree

it
was
contended

the
newtonian
doctrine
were
true
some
colours
would
be

are
the
arguments

shows
again
that
by
reversing

refracting

instead

colours
that
are

without

to

objection
it
is
now
admitted
that
the
difference
of
colour
is
not
a
test
of
difference
of
refrangibility
and
the
conclusion
deduced
by
newton
is
no
longer
admissible
as
a
general
truth
that
to
the

degree
of
refrangibility

in

the
general
mode
in
which
these
colours
are
produced
is
thus
explained
by
him
a

vertically
at

above

a

as
to
cover

two

lines
of

well
lastly
the

is

is

of
coloured
rings
is
produced
on
the
lamina
under
the
point
similar
to
those
observed
by

pressed

scale
of

thus
produced
corresponds
very
nearly
with

the

the

the

of

the

fully
investigated

that
the
chapter
in

probably
have

found
to
contain
very
little
to
interest
scientific
readers

whom
it
seems

to
have
been
intended

observation
occurs
in
it
which
indeed
has
more
reference
to
the
arts
in
order
to
make
this
intelligible
the
leading
experiment
must
be
first
described
and
for
this
purpose
the
following
extracts
may
serve
the
experiment
in
its
simplest
form
is
to
be
made
as
follows
let
a
tolerably
thick
piece
of
be
cut
into
several
squares
of
an
inch
and
a
half
let
these
be
heated
to
a
red
heat
and
then
suddenly
cooled
the
squares
of
glass
which
do
not
split
in
this
operation
are
now
fit
to
produce
the
entoptic
colours
in
our
mode
of
exhibiting
the
phenomenon
the
observer
is
above
all
to
betake
himself
with
his
apparatus

the
open
air
all
dark

all
small
apertures

are
again
to
be
given
up
a
pure
cloudless
sky
is
the
source
whence
we
are
derive
a
satisfactory
insight
into
the
appearances
the
atmosphere
being
clear
let
the
observer
lay
the
squares
above
described
on
a
black
surface
so
placing
them
that
two
sides
may
be
parallel
with
the
plane
of
vision
when
the
sun
is
low
let
him
hold
the
squares
so
as
to
reflect
to
the
eye
that
portion
of
the
sky
opposite
to
the
sun
and
he
will
then
perceive
four
dark
points
in
the
four
corners
of
a
light
space
if
after
this
he
turn
towards
the
quarters
of
the
sky
at
right
angles
with
that
where
his
first
observation
was
made
he
will
see
four
bright
points
on
a
dark
ground
between
the
two
regions
the
figures
appear
to
fluctuate
from
this
simple
reflection
we
now
proceed
to
another
which
but
little
more
complicated
exhibits
the
appearance
much
more
distinctly
a
solid
cube
of
glass
or
in
its
stead
a
cube
composed
of
several
plates
is
placed
on
a
black
mirror
or
held
a
little
inclined
above
it
at
or
the
reflection
of
the
sky
being
now
suffered
to
fall
through
the
cube
on
the
mirror
the
appearance
above
described
will
appear
more
distinctly
the
reflection
of
the
sky
opposite
to
the
sun
presents
four
dark
points
on
a
light
ground
the
two
lateral
portions
of
the
sky
present
the
contrary
appearance
namely
four
light
points
on
a
dark
ground
the
space
not
occupied
by
the
corner
points
appears
in
the
first
case
as
a
white
cross
in
the
other
as
a
black
cross
expressions
hereafter
employed
in
describing
the
phenomena
before
or
after
in
a
very
subdued
light
the
white
cross
appears
on
the
side
of
the
sun
also
we
thus
conclude
that
the
direct
reflection
of
the
sun
produces
a
light
figure
which
we
call
a
white
cross
the
oblique
reflection
gives
a
dark
figure
which
we
call
a
black
cross
if
we
make
the
experiment
all
round
the
sky
we
shall
find
that
a
fluctuation
takes
place
in
the
intermediate
regions
we
pass
over
a
variety
of
observations
on
the
modes
of
exhibiting
this
phenomenon
the
natural
transparent
substances
which
exhibit
it
best
and
the
detail
of
the

seen
within
them

proceed
to
an
instance
where

from

had
been
sufficiently
attended
to

after
our
friend
had
worked
for
some
time
it
appeared
to
him
in
painting
portraits
that
the
faces
he
copied
were
not
equally
well
lighted
at

hours
of
the
day

yet
his
sitters
always
occupied
the

place
and
the
serenity
of
the
atmosphere
was
unaltered

variations
of
the
favourable
and
unfavourable
light
had
their
periods
during
the
day

unpleasantly
grey

unsatisfactory

became
better

an
hour

objects
had
acquired

totally
different
appearance

presented
itself
to
the
eye
of
the
artist

its
greatest
perfection
as
he
would
most
wish
to
transfer
it
to
canvas
in
the
afternoon
this
beautiful
appearance
vanished
the

became
worse

in
the
brightest
day
without
any
change
having
taken
place
in

soon

heard
of

i
at
once
connected
it
in
my
own
mind
with
the
phenomena
which
i
had
been
so
long
observing
and
hastened
to
prove
by
a
physical
experiment
what
a
artist
had
discovered
entirely
of
himself
to
his
own
surprise
and
astonishment
i
had
the
second
entoptic
apparatus
brought
to
the
spot
and
the
effect
on
this
was
what
might
be
conjectured
from
the
above
statement
at
when
the
artist
saw
his
model

lighted

reflection
gave
the
white
cross
in

morning
and

on

other
hand

the
unfavourable

was
so
unpleasant
to
him
the
cube
showed
the
black
cross
in
the
intermediate
hours
the
state
of
transition
was
apparent
the
author
proceeds
to
recall
to
his
memory
instances
where
works
of
art
had
struck
him
by
the
beauty
of
their
appearance
owing
to
the
light
coming
from
the
quarter
opposite
the
sun
in
direct
reflection
and
adds
since
these
decided
effects
are
thus
traceable
to
their
cause
the
friends
of
art
in
looking
at
and
exhibiting
pictures
may
enhance
the
enjoyment
to
themselves
and
others
by
attending
to
a
fortunate
reflection

numbers

usual
indicate
the
corresponding
paragraphs

to

the

throughout
if
the
quality
is
opaque
and
consequently
greyish
such
an
affinity
is
obvious
but
in
many
fine
pictures
intense
black
seems
to
be
considered
as
the
last
effect
of
heat
and
in
accompanying
crimson
and
orange
may
be
said
rather
to
present
a
difference
of
degree
than
a
difference
of
kind
in
looking
at
the
great
picture
of
the
globe
we
find
this
last
result
produced
in
climates
where
the
sun
has
greatest
power
as
we
find
it
the
immediate
effect
of
fire
the
light
parts
of
black
animals
are
often
of
a
mellow
colour
the
spots
and
stripes
on
skins
and
shells
are
generally
surrounded
by
a
warm
hue
and
are
brown
before
they
are
absolutely
black
in
combustion
the
blackness
which
announces
the
complete
ignition
is
preceded
always
by
the
same
mellow
orange
colour
the
representation
of
this
process
was
probably
intended
by
the
greeks
in
the
black
and
subdued
orange
of
their
vases
indeed
the
very
colours
may
have
been
first
produced
in
the
kiln
but
without
supposing
that
they
were
retained
merely
from
this
accident
the
fact
that
the
combination
itself
is
extremely
harmonious
would
be
sufficient
to
account
for
its
adoption
many
of
the
remarks
of
aristotle
and
theophrastus
on
the
production
of
black
are
derived
from
the
observation
of
the
action
of
fire
and
on
one
occasion
the
former
distinctly
alludes
to
the
terracotta
kiln
that
the
above
opinion
as
to
the
nature
of
black
was
prevalent
in
the
sixteenth
century
may
be
inferred
from
lomazzo
who
observes
quanto
all
origine
e
generazione
de
colori
la
frigidità
è
la
madre
della
bianchezza
il
calore
è
padre
del
nero
the
positive
coldness
of
black
may
be
said
to
begin
when
it
approaches
grey
when
leonardo
da
vinci
says
that
black
is
most
beautiful
in
shade
he
probably
means
to
define
its
most
intense
and
transparent
state
when
it
is
furthest
removed
from
grey
de
coloribus
de
igne
trattato
the
rest
of
the
passage
it
must
be
admitted
abounds
with
absurdities
note
par
the
nature
of
vehicles
or
liquid
mediums
to
combine
with
the
substance
of
colours
has
been
frequently
discussed
by
modern
writers
on
art
and
may
perhaps
be
said
to
have
received
as
much
attention
as
it
deserves
reynolds
smiles
at
the
notion
of
our
not
having
materials
equal
to
those
of
former
times
and
indeed
although
the
methods
of
individuals
will
always
differ
there
seems
no
reason
to
suppose
that
any
great
technical
secret
has
been
lost
in
these
inquiries
however
which
relate
merely
to
the
mechanical
causes
of
bright
and
durable
colouring
the
skill
of
the
painter
in
the
adequate
employment
of
the
higher
resources
of
his
art
is
as
if
by
common
consent
left
out
of
the
account
and
without
departing
from
this
mode
of
considering
the
question
we
would
merely
repeat
a
conviction
before
expressed
viz
that
the
preservation
of
internal
brightness
a
quality
compatible
with
various
methods
has
had
more
to
do
with
the
splendour
and
durability
of
finely
coloured
pictures
than
any
vehicle
the
observations
that
follow
are
therefore
merely
intended
to
show
how
far
the
older
written
authorities
on
this
subject
agree
with
the
results
of
modern
investigation
without
at
all
assuming
that
the
old
methods
if
known
need
be
implicitly
followed
on
a
careful
examination
of
the
earlier
pictures
it
is
said
that
a
resinous
substance
appears
to
have
been
mingled
with
the
colours
together
with
the
oil
that
the
fracture
of
the
indurated
pigment
is
shining
and
that
the
surface
resists
the
ordinary
solvents
this
admixture
of
resinous
solutions
or
varnishes
with
the
solid
is
not
alluded
to
as
far
as
we
have
seen
by
any
of
the
writers
on
italian
practice
but
as
the
method
corresponds
with
that
now
prevalent
in
england
the
above
hypothesis
is
not
likely
to
be
objected
to
for
the
present
various
local
circumstances
and
relations
might
seem
to
warrant
the
supposition
that
the
venetian
painters
used
resinous
substances
an
important
branch
of
commerce
between
the
mountains
of
friuli
and
venice
still
consists
in
the
turpentine
or
similar
substances
produced
from
various
trees
and
known
under
the
common
name
of
balsams
were
imported
from
the
east
through
venice
for
general
use
before
the
american
balsams
in
some
degree
superseded
them
and
a
venetian
painter
marco
boschini
in
his
description
of
the
archipelago
does
not
omit
to
speak
of
the
abundance
of
mastic
produced
in
the
island
of
scio
the
testimonies
direct
or
indirect
against
the
employment
of
any
such
substances
by
the
venetian
painters
in
the
solid
part
of
their
work
seem
notwithstanding
very
conclusive
we
begin
with
the
writer
just
named
in
his
principal
composition
a
poem
describing
the
practice
and
the
productions
of
the
venetian
painters
boschini
speaks
of
certain
colours
which
they
shunned
and
adds
in
like
manner
they
avoided
shining
liquids
and
varnishes
which
i
should
rather
call
lackers
for
the
surface
of
flesh
if
natural
and
unadorned
assuredly
does
not
shine
nature
speaks
as
to
this
plainly
after
alluding
to
the
possible
alteration
of
this
natural
appearance
by
means
of
cosmetics
he
continues
foreign
artists
set
such
great
store
by
these
varnishes
that
a
shining
surface
seems
to
them
the
only
desirable
quality
in
art
what
trash
it
is
they
prize
mastic
and
sandarach
and
not
to
say
treacle
stuff
fit
to
polish
boots
if
those
great
painters
of
ours
had
to
represent
armour
a
gold
vase
a
mirror
or
anything
of
the
kind
they
made
it
shine
with
simple
colours
this
writer
so
frequently
alludes
to
the
flemish
painters
of
whose
great
reputation
he
sometimes
seems
jealous
that
the
above
strong
expression
of
opinion
may
have
been
pointed
at
them
on
the
other
hand
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
term
strangers
does
not
necessarily
mean
transalpine
foreigners
but
includes
those
italians
who
were
not
of
the
venetian
state
the
directions
given
by
raphael
borghini
and
after
him
by
armenini
respecting
the
use
and
preparation
of
varnishes
made
from
the
very
materials
in
question
may
thus
have
been
comprehended
in
the
censure
especially
as
some
of
these
recipes
were
copied
and
republished
in
venice
by
bisagno
in
that
is
only
six
years
before
boschini
poem
appeared
ridolfi
lives
of
the
venetian
painters
may
be
mentioned
with
the
two
last
his
only
observation
respecting
the
vehicle
is
that
giovanni
bellini
after
introducing
himself
by
an
artifice
into
the
of
antonello
da
messina
saw
that
painter
dip
his
brush
from
time
to
time
in
linseed
oil
this
story
related
about
two
hundred
years
after
the
supposed
event
is
certainly
not
to
be
adduced
as
very
striking
evidence
in
any
way
among
the
next
writers
in
order
of
time
prior
to
bisagno
may
be
mentioned
canepario
his
work
de
atramentis
contains
a
variety
of
recipes
for
different
purposes
one
chapter
atramentis
has
a
more
direct
reference
to
painting
his
observations
under
this
head
are
by
no
means
confined
to
the
preparation
of
transparent
colours
but
he
says
little
on
the
subject
of
varnishes
after
describing
a
mode
of
preserving
white
of
egg
he
says
others
are
accustomed
to
mix
colours
in
liquid
varnish
and
linseed
or
for
a
liquid
and
oily
varnish
binds
the
different
layers
of
colours
better
together
and
thus
forms
a
very
fit
glazing
material
on
the
subject
of
oils
he
observes
that
linseed
oil
was
in
great
request
among
painters
who
however
were
of
opinion
that
it
in
giving
brilliancy
to
pictures
in
preserving
them
better
and
in
rendering
the
colours
more
vivid
lomazzo
a
milanese
says
nothing
on
the
subject
of
vehicles
in
his
principal
work
but
in
his
idea
del
tempio
della
pittura
he
speaks
of
grinding
the
colours
in
and
and
other
things
the
and
here
evidently
means
and
by
other
things
we
are
perhaps
to
understand
other
oils
poppy
oil
drying
oils
the
directions
of
raphael
borghini
and
vasari
can
not
certainly
be
considered
conclusive
as
to
the
practice
of
the
venetians
but
they
are
very
clear
on
the
subject
of
varnish
these
writers
may
be
considered
the
earliest
italian
authorities
who
have
entered
much
into
practical
methods
in
the
few
observations
on
the
subject
of
vehicles
in
leonardo
da
vinci
treatise
there
is
nothing
as
merimée
observes
to
show
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
mixing
varnish
with
his
colours
cennini
says
but
little
on
the
subject
of
leon
battista
alberti
is
theoretical
rather
than
practical
and
the
published
extracts
of
lorenzo
ghiberti
chiefly
relate
to
sculpture
borghini
and
vasari
agree
in
recommending
in
preference
to
both
recommend
adding
varnish
to
the
colours
in
painting
on
walls
in
oil
because
the
work
does
not
then
require
to
be
varnished
afterwards
but
in
the
ordinary
modes
of
painting
on
panel
or
cloth
the
varnish
is
omitted
borghini
expressly
says
that
oil
alone
senza
più
is
to
be
employed
he
also
recommends
a
very
sparing
use
of
it
the
treatise
of
armenini
was
published
at
ravenna
and
he
himself
was
of
faenza
so
that
his
authority
again
can
not
be
considered
decisive
as
to
the
venetian
practice
after
all
he
recommends
the
addition
of
common
varnish
only
for
the
ground
or
preparation
as
a
consolidating
medium
for
the
glazing
colours
and
for
those
dark
pigments
which
are
slow
in
drying
many
of
his
directions
are
copied
from
the
writers
last
named
the
recipes
for
varnishes
in
particular
are
to
be
found
in
borghini
christoforo
sorte
briefly
alludes
to
the
subject
in
question
after
speaking
of
the
methods
of
distemper
he
observes
that
the
same
colours
may
be
used
in
oil
except
that
instead
of
mixing
them
with
size
they
are
mixed
on
the
palette
with
or
if
slow
in
drying
with
boiled
he
does
not
mention
varnish
the
italian
writers
next
in
order
are
earlier
than
vasari
and
may
therefore
be
considered
original
but
they
are
all
very
concise
the
treatise
of
michael
angelo
biondo
remarkable
for
its
historical
mistakes
is
not
without
interest
in
other
respects
the
list
of
colours
he
gives
is
in
all
probability
a
catalogue
of
those
in
general
use
in
venice
at
the
period
he
wrote
with
regard
to
the
vehicle
he
merely
mentions
oil
and
size
as
the
mediums
for
the
two
distinct
methods
of
and
distemper
and
does
not
speak
of
varnish
the
passages
in
the
dialogue
of
doni
which
relate
to
the
subject
in
question
are
to
the
same
effect
in
colouring
in
oil
he
observes
the
most
brilliant
colours
that
we
see
in
pictures
are
prepared
by
merely
mixing
them
with
the
end
of
a
knife
on
the
palette
speaking
of
the
perishable
nature
of
works
in
as
compared
with
sculpture
he
says
that
the
plaster
of
paris
gesso
and
mastic
with
other
ingredients
of
which
the
ground
is
prepared
are
liable
to
decay
and
elsewhere
in
comparing
painting
in
general
with
mosaic
that
in
the
former
the
colours
must
of
necessity
be
mixed
with
various
things
such
as
oils
gums
white
or
yolk
of
egg
and
juice
of
figs
all
which
tend
to
impair
the
beauty
of
the
tints
this
catalogue
of
vehicles
is
derived
from
all
kinds
of
painting
to
enforce
the
argument
and
is
by
no
means
to
be
understood
as
belonging
to
one
and
the
same
method
an
interesting
little
work
still
in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
fabio
and
lauro
appeared
a
year
earlier
the
author
paolo
pino
was
a
venetian
painter
in
speaking
of
the
practical
methods
fabio
observes
as
usual
that
is
of
all
modes
of
imitation
the
most
perfect
but
his
reasons
for
this
opinion
seem
to
have
a
reference
to
the
venetian
practice
of
going
over
the
work
repeatedly
lauro
asks
whether
it
is
not
possible
to
paint
in
oil
on
the
dry
wall
as
sebastian
del
piombo
did
fabio
answers
the
work
can
not
last
for
the
solidity
of
the
plaster
is
impenetrable
and
the
colours
whether
in
oil
or
distemper
can
not
pass
the
surface
this
might
seem
to
warrant
the
inference
that
absorbent
grounds
were
prepared
for
but
there
are
proofs
enough
that
resins
as
well
as
oil
were
used
with
the
to
make
the
preparation
compact
see
doni
armenini
this
writer
again
does
not
speak
of
varnish
these
appear
to
be
the
chief
venetian
and
italian
authorities
of
the
sixteenth
and
part
of
the
following
century
and
although
boschini
wrote
latest
he
appears
to
have
had
his
information
from
good
sources
and
more
than
once
distinctly
quotes
palma
giovane
in
all
these
instances
it
will
be
seen
that
there
is
no
allusion
to
the
immixture
of
varnishes
with
the
solid
colours
except
in
painting
on
walls
in
oil
and
that
the
processes
of
distemper
and
oil
are
always
considered
as
separate
arts
on
the
other
hand
the
prohibition
of
boschini
can
not
be
understood
to
be
universal
for
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
venetians
varnished
their
pictures
when
done
after
titian
had
finished
his
portrait
of
pope
paul
iii
it
was
placed
in
the
sun
to
be
varnished
again
in
the
archives
of
the
church
of
niccolo
at
treviso
a
sum
is
noted
per
far
la
vernise
da
invernisar
la
pala
dell
altar
grando
and
the
same
day
a
second
entry
appears
of
a
payment
to
a
painter
per
esser
venuto
a
dar
la
vernise
alla
pala
it
is
to
be
observed
that
in
both
these
cases
the
pictures
were
varnished
as
soon
as
done
the
varnish
employed
was
perhaps
the
thin
compound
of
naphtha
oglio
di
sasso
and
melted
turpentine
oglio
described
by
borghini
and
after
him
by
armenini
the
writer
remarks
that
he
had
seen
this
varnish
used
by
the
best
painters
in
lombardy
and
had
heard
that
it
was
preferred
by
correggio
the
consequence
of
this
immediate
varnishing
may
have
been
that
the
warm
resinous
liquid
whatever
it
was
became
united
with
the
colours
and
thus
at
a
future
time
the
pigment
may
have
acquired
a
consistency
capable
of
resisting
the
ordinary
solvents
not
only
was
the
surface
of
the
picture
required
to
be
warm
but
the
varnish
was
applied
soon
after
it
was
taken
from
the
fire
many
of
the
treatises
above
quoted
contain
directions
for
making
the
colours
dry
some
of
these
recipes
and
many
in
addition
are
to
be
found
in
palomino
who
however
defective
as
an
historian
has
left
very
copious
practical
details
evidently
of
ancient
date
his
drying
recipes
are
numerous
and
although
sugar
of
lead
does
not
appear
cardenillo
verdigris
which
is
perhaps
as
objectionable
is
admitted
to
be
the
best
of
all
dryers
it
may
excite
some
surprise
that
the
spanish
painters
should
have
bestowed
so
much
attention
on
this
subject
in
a
climate
like
theirs
but
the
rapidity
of
their
execution
must
have
often
required
such
an
assistance
one
circumstance
alluded
to
by
palomino
in
his
very
minute
practical
directions
deserves
to
be
mentioned
after
saying
what
colours
should
be
preserved
in
their
saucers
under
water
and
what
colours
should
be
merely
covered
with
oiled
paper
because
the
water
injures
them
he
proceeds
to
communicate
a
curious
mode
of
preserving
and
of
transporting
them
from
place
to
place
the
important
secret
is
to
tie
them
in
bladders
the
mode
of
doing
which
he
enters
into
with
great
minuteness
as
if
the
invention
was
recent
it
is
true
christoforo
sorte
in
describing
his
practice
in
drawing
says
he
was
in
the
habit
of
preserving
a
certain
vegetable
green
with
in
a
bladder
but
as
the
method
was
obviously
new
to
palomino
there
seems
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
when
once
ground
had
up
to
his
time
been
kept
in
saucers
and
preserved
under
water
among
the
items
of
expense
in
the
treviso
document
before
alluded
to
we
find
a
pan
and
saucers
for
the
painters
this
is
in
accordance
with
cennini
directions
and
the
same
system
appears
to
have
been
followed
till
after
the
flemish
accounts
of
the
early
practice
of
are
all
later
than
vasari
van
mander
in
correcting
the
italian
historian
in
his
dates
still
follows
his
narrative
in
other
respects
verbatim
if
vasari
story
is
to
be
accepted
as
true
it
might
be
inferred
that
the
flemish
secret
consisted
in
an
oil
varnish
like
copal
vasari
says
that
van
eyck
boiled
the
oils
with
other
ingredients
that
the
colours
when
mixed
with
this
kind
of
oil
had
a
very
firm
consistence
that
the
surface
of
the
pictures
so
executed
had
a
lustre
so
that
they
needed
no
varnish
when
done
and
that
the
colours
were
in
no
danger
from
water
certain
colours
as
is
well
known
if
mixed
with
oil
alone
may
be
washed
off
after
a
considerable
time
leonardo
da
vinci
remarks
that
verdigris
may
be
thus
removed
carmine
palomino
observes
may
be
washed
off
after
six
years
it
is
on
this
account
the
italian
writers
recommend
the
use
of
varnish
with
certain
colours
and
it
appears
the
venetians
and
perhaps
the
italians
generally
employed
it
solely
in
such
cases
but
it
is
somewhat
extraordinary
that
vasari
should
teach
a
mode
of
painting
in
oil
so
different
in
its
results
inasmuch
as
the
work
thus
required
varnish
at
last
from
the
flemish
method
which
he
so
much
extols
a
method
which
he
says
the
italians
long
endeavoured
to
find
out
in
vain
if
they
knew
it
it
is
evident
assuming
his
account
to
be
correct
that
they
did
not
practice
it
see
marcucci
saggio
sopra
i
colori

and
taylor
translation
of
merimée
on
london
the
work
contains
much
useful
information
italian
writers
of
the
century
speak
of
three
kinds

that

in
his
preface
that
the
books
on

were
few
and
that
painters
were
in
the
habit
of
keeping
them
secret
he
acknowledges
that
he
has
availed
himself
of
the
labours
of
others
but
without
mentioning
his
sources
some
passages
are
copied
from
lomazzo
he
however
lays
claim
to
some
original
observations
and
says
he
had
seen
much
and
discoursed
with
many
excellent
painters
le

it
has
been
conjectured
by
some
that
this
story
proved
the
immixture
of
varnishes
with
the
colours
and
that
the
oil
was
only
used
to
dilute
them
the
epitaph
on
antonello
da

which
existed
in
vasari
time
alludes
to
his
having

thus
if
is
to
be
understood
as
usual
to
mean
a

the
passage
can
only
refer
to
the
immixture
of

that

the

of

on
this
subject
and
on
the

of

may
have
given
the
first
hint
to
the
inventors
of
the
custom
of

the

of
this

from

that
of

the
particulars
here
alluded

are
to
be

in

of

as
well
as

it
appears

communicates
the
methods
taught
him
by
that
painter
for
giving
the
true
effects
of

in
compositions
of

he
is
perhaps
the
earliest
who
describes
the
process
of
painting
as
distinguished
from

and
as
adapted

as
they
contain
nothing
on
the

in

the
latest
authority
at
all
connected
with
the
traditions
of
venetian
practice
is
a
certain
giambatista
volpato
of
bassano
he
died
in
and
had
been
intimate
with
ridolfi
the
only
circumstance
he
has
transmitted
relating
to
practical
details
is
that
giacomo
bassan
in
retouching
on
a
dry
surface
sometimes
adopted
a
method
commonly
practised
he
says
by
paul
veronese
and
commonly
practised
still
namely
that
of
dipping
his
brush
in
spirits
of
turpentine
at
other
times
he
oiled
out
the
surface
in
the
usual
manner
volpato
left
a
which
was
announced
for
publication
in
vicenza
in
but
it
never
appeared
it
however
afterwards

it

with
historical
mistakes
the

says
for
instance
that
the
pietro
martyre
was
begun
by
giorgione
and
finished
by
titian
the
recipes
for
varnishes
and
colours
are
very
numerous
but
they
are
mostly
copied
from
earlier
works
that
distemper
was
not
very
highly
esteemed
by
the
venetians
may
be
inferred
from
the
following
observation
of
pino
il

via
it
is
however
certain
that
the
venetians
sometimes
painted
in
this
style
and
volpato
mentions
several
works
of
the
kind
by
bassan
but
he
never
hints
that
he
began
his
oil
pictures
in
distemper
boschini
says
that
the
venetians
he
especially
means
titian
rendered
their
pictures
sparkling
by
finally
touching
on
a
dry
surface
the
absence
of
varnish
in
the
solid
colours
the
retouching
with
spirit
of
turpentine
and
even
all
suppose
a
dull
surface
which
would
require
varnish
the
latter
method
alluded
to
by
boschini
was
an
exception
to
the
general
practice
and
not
likely
to
be
followed
on
account
of
its
difficulty
carlo
maratti
on
the
authority
of
palomino
used
to
say
he
must
be
a
skilful
painter
who
can
retouch
without
oiling
out
see
a
letter
by
francesco
bocchi
and
another
by
vasari
in
the
lettere
pittoriche
of
bottari
the
circumstance
is
mentioned
incidentally
the
point
chiefly
dwelt
on
is
that
some
persons
who

were
deceived
and
bowed
to

there

to

may
have
been
the

to

life

note
par
in
the
second
volume
goethe
gives
the
nomenclature
of
the
greeks
and
romans
at
some
length
the
general
notions
of
the
ancients
with
regard
to
colours
are
thus
described
the
ancients
derive
all
colours
from
white
and
black
from
light
and
darkness
they
say
all
colours
are
between
white
and
black
and
are
mixed
out
of
these
we
must
not
however
suppose
that
they
understand
by
this
a
mere
atomic
mixture
although
they
occasionally
use
the
word
μίξις
for
in
the
remarkable
passages
where
they
wish
to
express
a
kind
of
reciprocal
dynamic
action
of
the
two
contrasting
principles
they
employ
the
words
κρᾶσις
union
σύγκρισις
combination
thus
again
the
mutual
influence
of
light
and
darkness
and
of
colours
among
each
other
is
described
by
the
word
κεράννυστας
an
expression
of
similar
import
the
varieties
of
colours
are
differently
enumerated
some
mention
seven
others
twelve
but
without
giving
the
complete
list
from
a
consideration
of
the
terminology
both
of
the
greeks
and
romans
it
appears
that
they
sometimes
employed
general
for
specific
terms
and
their
denominations
of
colours
are
not
permanently
and
precisely
defined
but
mutable
and
fluctuating
for
they
are
employed
even
with
regard
to
similar
colours
both
on
the
and
side
their
yellow
on
the
one
hand
inclines
to
red
on
the
other
to
blue
the
blue
is
sometimes
green
sometimes
red
the
red
is
at
one
time
yellow
at
another
blue
pure
red
purpur
fluctuates
between
warm
red
and
blue
sometimes
inclining
to
scarlet
sometimes
to
violet
thus
the
ancients
not
only
seem
to
have
looked
upon
colour
as
a
mutable
and
fleeting
quality
but
appear
to
have
had
a
presentiment
of
the
physical
and
chemical
effects
of
augmentation
and
in
speaking
of
colours
they
make
use
of
expressions
which
indicate
this
knowledge
they
make
yellow
redden
because
its
augmentation
tends
to
red
they
make
red
become
yellow
for
it
often
returns
thus
to
its
origin
the
hues
thus
specified
undergo
new
modifications
the
colours
arrested
at
a
given
point
are
attenuated
by
a
stronger
light
darkened
by
a
shadow
nay
deepened
and
condensed
in
themselves
for
the
gradations
which
thus
arise
the
name
of
the
species
only
is
often
given
but
the
more
generic
terms
are
also
employed
every
colour
of
whatever
kind
can
according
to
the
same
view
be
multiplied
into
itself
condensed
enriched
and
will
in
consequence
appear
more
or
less
dark
the
ancients
called
colour
in
this
state
then
follow
the
designations
of
general
states
of
colour
and
those
of
specific
hues
another
essay
on
the
notions
of
the
ancients
respecting
the
origin
and
nature
of
colour

shows
how
nearly
goethe

followed
in

track

of

they
are

or

background
all
this
is
either
distinctly
expressed
or
hinted
at
but
continues
goethe
how
a
single
element
divides
itself
into
two

a
secret

them

knew
the
nature
of
the
magnet

as

was
not
yet

evident
to
them
and
in
very
modern
times
have
we
not
found
that
scientific
men
have
still
given
their
almost
exclusive
attention
to
attraction
and
considered
the

this
agrees
with
the
general
recommendation
so
often
given
by
high
authorities
in
art
to
avoid
a

look
in
the
colour
of
flesh
the
great
example
of
rubens
whose
practice
was
sometimes
an
exception
to
this

however
show
that
no
rule
of
art
is
to
be
blindly
or
exclusively
adhered
to
reynolds
nevertheless
in
the
midst
of
his
admiration
for
this
great
painter
considered
the
example
dangerous
and
more
than
once
expresses
himself
to
this
effect
observing
on
one
occasion
that
rubens
like
baroccio
is
sometimes
open
to
the
criticism
made
on
an
ancient
painter
namely
that
his
figures
looked
as
if
they
fed
on
roses

our
great
titian
used
to
say
that
he
who
wishes
to
be
a
painter
should
be
acquainted
with
three
colours
white
black
and
red
assuming
this
account
to
be
a
little
exaggerated
it
is
still
to
be
observed
that
the
monotony
to
which
the
use
of
few
colours
would
seem
to
tend
is
prevented
by
the
nature
of
the
venetian
process
which
was
sufficiently
conformable
to
goethe
doctrine
the
gradations
being
multiplied
and
the
effect
of
the
colours
heightened
by
using
them
as
mediums
immediately
after
the
passage
last
quoted
we
read
he
also
gave
this
true
precept
that
to
produce
a
lively
colouring
in
flesh
it
is
not
possible
to
finish
at
once
as
these
particulars
may
not
be
known
to
all
we
add
some
further
abridged
extracts
explaining
the
order
and
methods
of
these
different
operations
the
venetian
painters
says
this
writer
after
having
drawn
in
their
subject
got
in
the
masses
with
very
solid
colour
without
making
use
of
nature
or
statues
their
great
object
in
this
stage
of
their
work
was
to
distinguish
the
advancing
and
retiring
portions
that
the
figures
might
be
relieved
by
means
of
one
of
the
most
important
departments
of
colour
and
form
and
indeed
of
invention
having
decided
on
their
scheme
of
effect
when
this
preparation
was
dry
they
consulted
nature
and
the
antique
not
servilely
but
with
the
aid
of
a
few
lines
on
paper
segni
in
they
corrected
their
figures
without
any
other
model
then
returning
to
their
brushes
they
began
to
paint
smartly
on
this
preparation
producing
the
colour
of
flesh
the
passage
before
quoted
follows
stating
that
they
used
earths
chiefly
that
they
carefully
avoided
certain
colours
and
likewise
varnishes
and
whatever
produces
a
shining
surface
when
this
second
painting
was
dry
they
proceeded
to
scumble
over
this
or
that
figure
with
a
low
tint
to
make
the
one
next
it
come
forward
giving
another
at
the
same
time
an
additional
light
for
example
on
a
head
a
hand
or
a
foot
thus
detaching
them
so
to
speak
from
the
canvas
tintoret
di
is
here
quoted
by
thus
still
multiplying
these
retouchings
where
required
on
the
dry
surface
à
secco
they
reduced
the
whole
to
harmony
in
this
operation
they
took
care
not
to
cover
entire
figures
but
rather
went
on
gemming
them
gioielandole
with
vigorous
touches
in
the
shadows
too
they
infused
vigour
frequently
by
glazing
with
asphaltum
always
leaving
great
masses
in
with
many
darks
in
addition
to
the
partial
glazings
and
few
lights
the
introduction
to
the
subject
of
venetian
colouring
in
the
poem
by
the
same
author
is
also
worth
transcribing
but
as
the
style
is
quaint
and
very
concise
a
translation
is
necessarily
a
paraphrase
the
art
of
colouring
has
the
imitation
of
qualities
for
its
object
not
all
qualities
but
those
secondary
ones
which
are
appreciable
by
the
sense
of
sight
the
eye
especially
sees
colours
the
imitation
of
nature
in
painting
is
therefore
justly
called
colouring
but
the
painter
arrives
at
his
end
by
indirect
means
he
gives
the
varieties
of
tone
in
masses
he
smartly
impinges
lights
he
clothes
his
preparation
with
more
delicate
local
hues
he
unites
he
glazes
thus
everything
depends
on
the
method
on
the
process
for
if
we
look
at
colour
abstractedly
the
most
positive
may
be
called
the
most
beautiful
but
if
we
keep
the
end
of
imitation
in
view
this
shallow
conclusion
falls
to
the
ground
the
refined
venetian
manner
is
very
different
from
mere
direct
sedulous
imitation
every
one
who
has
a
good
eye
may
arrive
at
such
results
but
to
attain
the
manner
of
paolo
of
bassan
of
palma
tintoret
or
titian
is
a
very
different
undertaking
the
effects
of
mediums
in
some
natural
productions
seem
alluded
to
in
the
following
passage
nature
sometimes
accidentally
imitates
figures
in
stones
and
other
substances
and
although
they
are
necessarily
incomplete
in
form
yet
the
principle
of
effect
depth
resembles
the
venetian
practice
in
a
passage
that
follows
there
appears
to
be
an
allusion
to
the
production
of
the
atmospheric
colours
by
mediums

removed
from

the

the
quotation
before
given
from
boschini
shows
that
the
method
described
by
the
author
and
which
is
true
with
regard
to
some
of
the
florentine
painters
was
not
practised
by
the
venetians
for
their
first
painting
was
very
solid
it
agrees
however
with
the
manner
of
rubens
many
of
whose
works
sufficiently
corroborate
the
account
of
his
process
given
by
descamps
in
the
early
state
of
pictures
says
that
writer
everything
appeared
like
a
thin
wash
but
although
he
often
made
use
of
the
ground
in
producing
his
tones
the
canvas
was
entirely
covered
more
or
less
with
colour
in
this
system
of
leaving
the
shadows
transparent
from
the
first
with
the
ground
shining
through
them
it
would
have
been
obviously
destructive
of
richness
to
use
white
mixed
with
the
darks
the
brightness
in
fact
already
existed
underneath
hence
the
precept
of
rubens
to
avoid
white
in
the
shadows
a
precept
like
many
others
belonging
to
a
particular
practice
and
involving
all
the
conditions
of
that
practice
scarmiglione
whose
aristotelian
treatise
on
colour
was
published
in
germany
when
rubens
was
observes
painters
with
consummate
art
lock
up
the
bright
colours
with
dark
ones
and
on
the
other
hand
employ

the
method
he
recommended
for
keeping
the
colours
pure
in
the
lights
viz
to
place
the
tints
next
each
other
unmixed
and
then
slightly
to
unite
them
may
have
degenerated
to
a
methodical
manner
in
the
hands
of
his
followers
boschini
who
speaks
of
rubens
himself
with
due
reverence
and
is
far
from
confounding
him
with
his
imitators
contrasts
such
a
system
with
that
of
the
venetians

the
poem
of
boschini
is
in
many
respects
polemical
he
wrote
at
a
time
when
the
flemish
painters
having
adopted
and
modified
the
venetian
principles
threatened
to
supersede
the
italian
masters
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
their
excellence
too
had
all
the
charm
of
novelty

in
the
seventeenth

venice
produced
no
remarkable
talent
and
it
was
precisely
the
age
for
her
to
boast
of
past
glories
the
contemptuous
manner
in
which
boschini
speaks
of
the
flemish
varnishes
of
the
fear
of
mixing
tints
is
thus
always
to
be
considered
with
reference
to
the
time
and
circumstances
so
also
his
boasting
that
the
venetian
masters
painted
without
nature
which
may
be
an
exaggeration
is
pointed
at
the
caravaggio

his
followers

in

of
