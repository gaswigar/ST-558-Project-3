at
a
season
when
the
pleasant
island
has
few
attractions
to
other
than
invalids
and
hermits
enamoured
of
wind
and
rain
the
potent
nobleman
lord
mountfalcon
still
lingered
there
to
the
disgust
of
his
friends
and
special
parasite
mount
in
for
it
again
they
said
among
themselves
hang
the
women
was
a
natural
sequence
for
do
you
see
what
a
shame
it
was
of
the
women
to
be
always
kindling
such
a
very
inflammable
subject
all
understood
that
cupid
had
twanged
his
bow
and
transfixed
a
peer
of
britain
for
the
fiftieth
time
but
none
would
perceive
though
he
vouched
for
it
with
his
most
eloquent
oaths
that
this
was
a
totally
different
case
from
the
antecedent
ones
so
it
had
been
sworn
to
them
too
frequently
before
he
was
as
a
man
with
mighty
tidings
and
no
language
intensely
communicative
but
inarticulate
good
round
oaths
had
formerly
compassed
and
expounded
his
noble
emotions
they
were
now
quite
beyond
the
comprehension
of
blasphemy
even
when
emphasized
and
by
this
the
poor
lord
divinely
felt
the
case
was
different
there
is
something
impressive
in
a
great
human
hulk
writhing
under
the
unutterable
torments
of
a
mastery
he
can
not
contend
with
or
account
for
or
explain
by
means
of
intelligible
words
at
first
he
took
refuge
in
the
depths
of
his
contempt
for
women
cupid
gave
him
line
when
he
had
come
to
vent
his
worst
of
them
the
fair
face
now
stamped
on
his
brain
beamed
the
more
triumphantly
so
the
harpooned
whale
rose
to
the
surface
and
after
a
few
convulsions
surrendered
his
huge
length
my
lord
was
in
love
with
richard
young
wife
he
gave
proofs
of
it
by
burying
himself
beside
her
to
her
could
she
have
seen
it
he
gave
further
proofs
of
a
real
devotion
in
affecting
and
in
her
presence
feeling
nothing
beyond
a
lively
interest
in
her
this
wonder
that
when
near
her
he
should
be
cool
and
composed
and
when
away
from
her
wrapped
in
a
tempest
of
desires
was
matter
for
what
powers
of
cogitation
the
heavy
nobleman
possessed
the
hon
peter
tired
of
his
journeys
to
and
fro
urged
him
to
press
the
business
lord
mountfalcon
was
wiser
or
more
scrupulous
than
his
parasite
almost
every
evening
he
saw
lucy
the
inexperienced
little
wife
apprehended
no
harm
in
his
visits
moreover
richard
had
commended
her
to
the
care
of
lord
mountfalcon
and
lady
judith
lady
judith
had
left
the
island
for
london
lord
mountfalcon
remained
there
could
be
no
harm
if
she
had
ever
thought
so
she
no
longer
did
secretly
perhaps
she
was
flattered
lord
mountfalcon
was
as
well
educated
as
it
is
the
fortune
of
the
run
of
titled
elder
sons
to
be
he
could
talk
and
instruct
he
was
a
lord
and
he
let
her
understand
that
he
was
wicked
very
wicked
and
that
she
improved
him
the
heroine
in
common
with
the
hero
has
her
ambition
to
be
of
use
in
the
world
to
do
some
good
and
the
task
of
reclaiming
a
bad
man
is
extremely
seductive
to
good
women
dear
to
their
tender
bosoms
as
old
china
is
a
bad
man
they
are
mending
lord
mountfalcon
had
none
of
the
arts
of
a
libertine
his
gold
his
title
and
his
person
had
hitherto
preserved
him
from
having
long
to
sigh
in
vain
or
sigh
at
all
possibly
the
hon
peter
did
his
villanies
for
him
no
alarm
was
given
to
lucy
pure
instinct
as
might
have
been
the
case
had
my
lord
been
it
was
nice
in
her
martyrdom
to
have
a
true
friend
to
support
her
and
really
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
that
friend
too
to
think
much
of
his
lordship
position
she
was
yet
a
woman
he
a
great
nobleman
does
not
scorn
to
acknowledge
me
and
think
something
of
me
may
have
been
one
of
the
passing
through
her
now
and
then
as
she
reflected
in
defence
on
the
proud
family
she
had
married
into
january
was
watering
and
freezing
old
earth
by
turns
when
the
hon
peter
travelled
down
to
the
sun
of
his
purse
with
great
news
he
had
no
sooner
broached
his
lordship
immediate
weakness
than
mountfalcon
began
to
plunge
like
a
heavy
dragoon
in
difficulties
he
swore
by
this
and
that
he
had
come
across
an
angel
for
his
sins
and
would
do
her
no
hurt
the
next
moment
he
swore
she
must
be
his
though
she
cursed
like
a
cat
his
lordship
illustrations
were
not
choice
i
have
advanced
an
inch
he
groaned
brayder
upon
my
soul
that
little
woman
could
do
anything
with
me
by
heaven
i
marry
her
here
i
am
seeing
her
every
day
in
the
week
out
or
in
and
what
do
you
think
she
gets
me
to
talk
about
history
is
it
enough
to
make
a
fellow
mad
and
there
am
i
lecturing
like
a
prig
and
by
heaven
while
i
at
it
i
feel
a
pleasure
in
it
and
when
i
leave
the
house
i
should
feel
an
immense
gratification
in
shooting
somebody
what
do
they
say
in
town
not
much
said
brayder
significantly
when
that
fellow
her
husband
coming
down
i
rather
hope
we
settled
him
for
life
mount
nobleman
and
parasite
exchanged
looks
how
d
mean
brayder
hummed
an
air
and
broke
it
to
say
he
in
for
don
juan
at
a
gallop
that
all
the
deuce
has
bella
got
him
mountfalcon
asked
with
eagerness
brayder
handed
my
lord
a
letter
it
was
dated
from
the
sussex
coast
signed
richard
and
was
worded
thus
my
beautiful
devil
since
we
both
devils
together
and
have
found
each
other
out
come
to
me
at
once
or
i
shall
be
going
somewhere
in
a
hurry
come
my
bright
i
ran
away
from
you
and
now
i
ask
you
to
come
to
me
you
have
taught
me
how
devils
love
and
i
ca
do
without
you
come
an
hour
after
you
receive
this
mountfalcon
turned
over
the
letter
to
see
if
there
was
any
more
complimentary
he
remarked
and
rising
from
his
chair
and
striding
about
muttered
the
dog
how
infamously
he
treats
his
wife
very
bad
said
brayder
how
did
you
get
hold
of
this
strolled
into
belle
waiting
for
her
turned
over
her
pincushion
you
know
her
trick
by
jove
i
think
that
girl
does
it
on
purpose
thank
heaven
i
written
her
any
letters
for
an
age
is
she
going
to
him
not
she
but
it
odd
mount
did
you
ever
know
her
refuse
money
before
she
tore
up
the
cheque
in
style
and
presented
me
the
fragments
with
two
or
three
of
the
delicacies
of
language
she
learnt
at
your
academy
i
rather
like
to
hear
a
woman
swear
it
embellishes
her
mountfalcon
took
counsel
of
his
parasite
as
to
the
end
the
letter
could
be
made
to
serve
both
conscientiously
agreed
that
richard
behaviour
to
his
wife
was
infamous
and
that
he
at
least
deserved
no
mercy
but
said
his
lordship
it
wo
do
to
show
the
letter
at
first
she
be
swearing
it
false
and
then
she
stick
to
him
closer
i
know
the
sluts
the
rule
of
contrary
said
brayder
carelessly
she
must
see
the
trahison
with
her
eyes
they
believe
their
eyes
there
your
chance
mount
you
step
in
you
give
her
revenge
and
consolation
two
birds
at
one
shot
that
what
they
like
you
an
ass
brayder
the
nobleman
exclaimed
you
an
infernal
blackguard
you
talk
of
this
little
woman
as
if
she
and
other
women
were
all
of
a
piece
i
do
see
anything
i
gain
by
this
confounded
letter
her
husband
a
brute
that
clear
will
you
leave
it
to
me
mount
be
damned
before
i
do
muttered
my
lord
thank
you
now
see
how
this
will
end
you
too
soft
mount
be
made
a
fool
of
i
tell
you
brayder
there
nothing
to
be
done
if
i
carry
her
off
i
been
on
the
point
of
doing
it
every
day
what
come
of
that
she
look
i
ca
stand
her
eyes
i
shall
be
a
fool
worse
off
with
her
than
i
am
now
mountfalcon
yawned
despondently
and
what
do
you
think
he
pursued
is
it
enough
to
make
a
fellow
gnash
his
teeth
she
he
mentioned
something
in
an
underbreath
and
turned
red
as
he
said
it
hm
brayder
put
up
his
mouth
and
rapped
the
handle
of
his
cane
on
his
chin
that
disagreeable
mount
you
do
exactly
want
to
act
in
that
character
you
have
got
a
diploma
bother
do
you
think
i
love
her
a
bit
less
broke
out
my
lord
in
a
frenzy
by
heaven
i
read
to
her
by
her
bedside
and
talk
that
infernal
history
to
her
if
it
pleased
her
all
day
and
all
night
you
evidently
graduating
for
a
midwife
mount
the
nobleman
appeared
silently
to
accept
the
imputation
what
do
they
say
in
town
he
asked
again
brayder
said
the
sole
question
was
whether
it
was
maid
wife
or
widow
i
go
to
her
this
evening
mountfalcon
resumed
after
to
judge
by
the
cast
of
his
face
reflecting
deeply
i
go
to
her
this
evening
she
shall
know
what
infernal
torment
she
makes
me
suffer
do
you
mean
to
say
she
do
know
it
has
an
idea
thinks
me
a
friend
and
so
by
heaven
i
be
to
her
a
hm
went
the
honourable
peter
this
way
to
the
sign
of
the
green
man
ladies
do
you
want
to
be
pitched
out
of
the
window
brayder
once
was
enough
mount
the
salvage
man
is
strong
i
may
have
forgotten
the
trick
of
alighting
on
my
feet
there
there
i
be
sworn
she
excessively
innocent
and
thinks
you
a
disinterested
friend
i
go
to
her
this
evening
mountfalcon
repeated
she
shall
know
what
damned
misery
it
is
to
see
her
in
such
a
position
i
ca
hold
out
any
longer
deceit
horrible
to
such
a
girl
as
that
i
rather
have
her
cursing
me
than
speaking
and
looking
as
she
does
dear
little
girl
only
a
child
you
have
an
idea
how
sensible
that
little
woman
is
have
you
inquired
the
cunning
one
my
belief
is
brayder
that
there
are
angels
among
women
said
mountfalcon
evading
his
parasite
eye
as
he
spoke
to
the
world
lord
mountfalcon
was
the
thoroughly
wicked
man
his
parasite
simply
ingeniously
dissipated
full
many
a
man
of
god
had
thought
it
the
easier
task
to
reclaim
the
hon
peter
lucy
received
her
noble
friend
by
firelight
that
evening
and
sat
much
in
the
shade
she
offered
to
have
the
candles
brought
in
he
begged
her
to
allow
the
room
to
remain
as
it
was
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
he
observed
with
a
certain
solemnity
yes
to
me
said
lucy
quickly
lord
mountfalcon
knew
he
had
a
great
deal
to
say
but
how
to
say
it
and
what
it
exactly
was
he
did
not
know
you
conceal
it
admirably
he
began
but
you
must
be
very
lonely
here
i
fear
unhappy
i
should
have
been
lonely
but
for
your
kindness
my
lord
said
lucy
i
am
not
unhappy
her
face
was
in
shade
and
could
not
belie
her
is
there
any
help
that
one
who
would
really
be
your
friend
might
give
you
mrs
feverel
none
indeed
that
i
know
of
lucy
replied
who
can
help
us
to
pay
for
our
sins
at
least
you
may
permit
me
to
endeavour
to
pay
my
debts
since
you
have
helped
me
to
wash
out
some
of
any
sins
ah
my
lord
said
lucy
not
displeased
it
is
sweet
for
a
woman
to
believe
she
has
drawn
the
serpent
teeth
i
tell
you
the
truth
lord
mountfalcon
went
on
what
object
could
i
have
in
deceiving
you
i
know
you
quite
above
flattery
so
different
from
other
women
oh
pray
do
not
say
that
interposed
lucy
according
to
my
experience
then
but
you
say
you
have
met
such
such
very
bad
women
i
have
and
now
that
i
meet
a
good
one
it
is
my
misfortune
your
misfortune
lord
mountfalcon
yes
and
i
might
say
more
his
lordship
held
impressively
mute
how
strange
men
are
thought
lucy
he
had
some
unhappy
secret
tom
bakewell
who
had
a
habit
of
coming
into
the
room
on
various
pretences
during
the
nobleman
visits
put
a
stop
to
the
revelation
if
his
lordship
intended
to
make
any
when
they
were
alone
again
lucy
said
smiling
do
you
know
i
am
always
ashamed
to
ask
you
to
begin
to
read
mountfalcon
stared
to
read
oh
ha
yes
he
remembered
his
evening
duties
very
happy
i
sure
let
me
see
where
were
we
the
life
of
the
emperor
julian
but
indeed
i
feel
quite
ashamed
to
ask
you
to
read
my
lord
it
new
to
me
like
a
new
world
hearing
about
emperors
and
armies
and
things
that
really
have
been
on
the
earth
we
walk
upon
it
fills
my
mind
but
it
must
have
ceased
to
interest
you
and
i
was
thinking
that
i
would
not
tease
you
any
more
your
pleasure
is
mine
feverel
my
honour
i
read
till
i
was
hoarse
to
hear
your
remarks
are
you
laughing
at
me
do
i
look
so
lord
mountfalcon
had
fine
full
eyes
and
by
merely
dropping
the
lids
he
could
appear
to
endow
them
with
mental
expression
no
you
are
not
said
lucy
i
must
thank
you
for
your
forbearance
the
nobleman
went
on
his
honour
loudly
now
it
was
an
object
of
lucy
to
have
him
reading
for
his
sake
for
her
sake
and
for
somebody
else
sake
which
somebody
else
was
probably
considered
first
in
the
matter
when
he
was
reading
to
her
he
seemed
to
be
legitimizing
his
presence
there
and
though
she
had
no
doubts
or
suspicions
whatever
she
was
easier
in
her
heart
while
she
had
him
employed
in
that
office
so
she
rose
to
fetch
the
book
laid
it
open
on
the
table
at
his
lordship
elbow
and
quietly
waited
to
ring
for
candles
when
he
should
be
willing
to
commence
that
evening
lord
mountfalcon
could
not
get
himself
up
to
the
farce
and
he
felt
a
pity
for
the
strangely
innocent
unprotected
child
with
anguish
hanging
over
her
that
withheld
the
words
he
wanted
to
speak
or
insinuate
he
sat
silent
and
did
nothing
what
i
do
not
like
him
for
said
lucy
meditatively
is
his
changing
his
religion
he
would
have
been
such
a
hero
but
for
that
i
could
have
loved
him
who
is
it
you
could
have
loved
mrs
feverel
lord
mountfalcon
asked
the
emperor
julian
oh
the
emperor
julian
well
he
was
an
apostate
but
then
you
know
he
meant
what
he
was
about
he
did
even
do
it
for
a
woman
for
a
woman
cried
lucy
what
man
would
for
a
woman
i
would
you
lord
mountfalcon
yes
i
turn
catholic
you
make
me
very
unhappy
if
you
say
that
my
lord
then
i
unsay
it
lucy
slightly
shuddered
she
put
her
hand
upon
the
bell
to
ring
for
lights
do
you
reject
a
convert
mrs
feverel
said
the
nobleman
oh
yes
yes
i
do
one
who
does
not
give
his
conscience
i
would
not
have
if
he
gives
his
heart
and
body
can
he
give
more
lucy
hand
pressed
the
bell
she
did
not
like
the
doubtful
light
with
one
who
was
so
unscrupulous
lord
mountfalcon
had
never
spoken
in
this
way
before
he
spoke
better
too
she
missed
the
aristocratic
twang
in
his
voice
and
the
hesitation
for
words
and
the
fluid
lordliness
with
which
he
rolled
over
difficulties
in
speech
simultaneously
with
the
sounding
of
the
bell
the
door
opened
and
presented
tom
bakewell
there
was
a
double
knock
at
the
same
instant
at
the

with
horror
i

to

her
countenance
lord
mountfalcon
mrs

sought
grace
while

performed
a
series
of
apologetic
bobs
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
her
forehead
lucy
put
her
into
a
chair
lord
mountfalcon
asked
for
an
account
of
her
passage
over
to
the
island
receiving
distressingly
full
particulars
by
which
it
was
revealed
that
the
softness
of
her
heart
was
only
equalled
by
the
weakness
of
her
stomach
the
recital
calmed
berry
down
well
and
where
my
where
richard
yer
husband
my
dear
berry
turned
from
her
tale
to

and
bowing
lucy
gave
him
her
hand

mute
thanks

distantly
embraced

in
a
farewell
bow
and
was
shown
out
of
the
house
by
tom
bakewell
the
moment
he
was
gone
berry
threw
up
her
arms
did

heart
to
all

time
and
i
can

not
help
crying
mrs
berry
berry
was
inclined
to
be
miserable
at
what
she
heard
from
lips
and
she
was
herself
full
of
dire
apprehension
but
it
was
never
this
excellent
creature
system
to
be
miserable
in
company
the
sight
of
a
sorrow
that
was
not
positive
and
could
not
refer
to
proof
set
her
resolutely
the
other
way
she
said
i
like
to
see
him
repent
he
wo
find
anywheres
a
beauty
like
his
own
dear
little
wife
and
he

weepin
pet
the
man
that

hair
of
yours
there
in
ruins
and
he
backed
by
the
law
and
not
rush
into
your
arms
and
hold
ye
squeezed
for
life
he
ai
got
much
man
in
him
i

i
was
sayin
look
here
to
comfort
ye
oh
why
to
be

some
surprise
for

i
my

lucy
that

gone
to
his
father
she
burst
into
fresh
tears
berry
paused
disturbed
belike
he
travellin
after
him
she
suggested
fifteen
days
mrs
berry
ah
fifteen
weeks
my
dear
after
sieh
a
man
as
that

a
regular
meteor

sir

feverel
raynham
abbey
well

says
the
never

for
you

to
come
up
and
beg

go
and

your
mistake
my

ever
to

your
husband
to
go
away
from
ye
one
hour
in
a
young
marriage
it
dangerous
it
mad
it
wrong
and
only
to
be
righted
by
your
obeyin
of
me
as
i
commands

for
i
has
my
fits
though
i
am
a
soft
obey
me
and

happy
tomorrow
or
the
next
to

lucy
was
willing
to
see
comfort
she
was
weary
of
her
martyrdom
and
glad
to
give
herself
up
to
somebody
else
guidance
utterly
but
why
does
he
not
write
to
me
mrs
berry
who
can
tell
the
why
of
men
my
dear
but
that
he
love
ye
faithful
i
swear
have
he
groaned
in
my
arms
that
he
come
to
ye
weak
wretch
has
he
swore
how
he
loved
ye
to
me
poor
young
man
but
this
is
your
fault
my
sweet
yes
it
be
you
should
followed
my
at
the
fust
o
going
into
your
about
this
and
here
berry
poured
forth
fresh
sentences
on
matrimony
pointed
especially
at
young
couples
i
should
been
a
fool
if
i
had
suffered
myself
she
confessed
so
i
thank
my
berry
if
i
makes
you
wise
in
season
lucy
smoothed
her
ruddy
plump
cheeks
and
gazed
up
affectionately
into
the
soft
woman
kind
brown
eyes
endearing
phrases
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
as
she
gazed
lucy
blushed
as
one
who
has
something
very
secret
to
tell
very
sweet
very
strange
but
can
not
quite
bring
herself
to
speak
it
well
these
three
men
in
my
life
i
kissed
said
berry
too
much
absorbed
in
her
extraordinary
adventure
to
notice
the
young
struggling
bosom
three
men
and
one
a
nobleman
he
got
more
whisker
than
my
berry

i
was
glad
o
my
chance
they
that
vain
whether
they

a
ruffled
breast

very
ungenerous
suspicious
naughty
old
woman

lucy
chiding

incapable
of

dropping
him
was
continuing
to

go
and
boast
i
kiss
him
he
ai
nothin
to
be
of
in
a
chaste
woman
kiss
unawares
which
men
do
get
too
often
in
their
lives
i
can
assure
her
eye
surveyed
lucy
figure
lo
when
lucy
returned
to
her
berry
surrounded
her
with
her
arms
and
drew
her
into
feminine
depths
oh
you
blessed
she
cried
in
most
meaning
tone
you
good
lovin
proper
little
wife
you
what
is
it
mrs
berry
lisps
lucy
opening
the
most
innocent
blue
eyes
as
if
i
could
see
you
pet
it
was
my
flurry
blinded
me
or
i
marked
ye
the
fast
shock
thinkin
to
deceive
me
berry
eyes
spoke
generations
lucy
wavered
she
coloured
all
over
and
hid
her
face
on
the
bounteous
breast
that
mounted
to
her
you
a
sweet
one
murmured
the
soft
woman
patting
her
back
and
rocking
her
you
a
rose
you
are
and
a
bud
on
your
stalk
told
a
word
to
your
husband
my
dear
she
asked
quickly
lucy
shook
her
head
looking
sly
and
shy
that
right
we
give
him
a
surprise
let
it
come
all
at
once
on
him
and
thinks
he
losin
breath
a
father
nor
a
hint
even
you
have
give
him
lucy
kissed
her
to
indicate
it
was
quite
a
secret
oh
you
are
a
sweet
one
said
bessy
berry
and
rocked
her
more
closely
and
lovingly
then
these
two
had
a
whispered
conversation
from
which
let
all
of
male
persuasion
retire
a
space
nothing
under
one
mile
returning
after
a
due
interval
we
see
berry
counting
on
her
fingers
ends
concluding
the
sum
she
cries
prophetically
now
this
right
everything
a
baby
in
the
balance
now
i
say
this
come
from
on
high
it
god
messenger
my
love
and
it
not
wrong
to
say
so
he
thinks
you
worthy
or
you
would
had
one
not
for
all
the
tryin
in
the
world
you

and
some
tries
hard
enough
poor
creatures
now

rejice
and
make
merry
i
for
cryin
and
laughin
one
and
the
same
this
is
the
blessed
seal
of
matrimony
which
berry
never
stamp
on
me
it
be
hoped
it
a
boy
make
that
man
a
grandfather
and
his
grandchild
a
son
and
you
got
him
safe
oh
this
is
what
i
call

i
have
my
tea
a
little
stronger
in
consequence
i
declare
i
could
get
tipsy
to

joyful
news

carolled
she
had
her
tea
a
little
stronger
she
ate
and
she
drank
she
rejoiced
and
made
merry
the
bliss
of
the
chaste
was
hers

opened
certain
drawers
and
exhibited
pretty
caps
and
laced
linen
all
adapted
for
a
very
small
body
all
the
work
of
her
own
hands
and
berry
praised
them
and
her
you
been
guessing
a
boy
she
said
then
they
cooed
and
kissed
and
undressed
by
the
fire
and
knelt
at
the
bedside
with
their
arms
about
each
other
praying
both
praying
for
the
unborn
child
and
berry
pressed
lucy
waist
the
moment
she
was
about
to
breathe
the
petition
to
heaven
to
shield
and
bless
that
coming
life
and
thereat
lucy
closed
to
her
and
felt
a
strong
love
for
her
then
lucy
got
into
bed
first
leaving
berry
to
put
out
the
light
and
before
she
did
so
berry
leaned
over
her
and
eyed
her
roguishly
saying
i
never
see
ye
like
this
but
i
half
in
love
with
ye
myself
you
blushin
beauty
sweet
your
eyes
and
your
hair
do
take
one
so
lyin
back
i
never
forgive
my
father
if
he
kep
me
away
from
ye
hours
just
husband
o
that
berry
pointed
at
the
young
wife
loveliness
ye
look
so
ripe
with
kisses
and
there
they
are
you
never
look
so
but
in
your
bed
ye
beauty
just
as
it
ought
to
be
lucy
had
to
pretend
to
rise
to
put
out
the
light
before
berry
would
give
up
her
amorous
chaste
soliloquy
then
they
lay
in
bed
and
berry
fondled
her
and
arranged
for
their
departure
and
reviewed
richard
emotions
when
he
came
to
hear
he
was
going
to
be
made
a
father
by
her
and
hinted
at
lucy
delicious
shivers
when
richard
was
again
in
his
rightful
place
which
she
bessy
berry
now
usurped
and
all
sorts
of
amorous
sweet
things
enough
to
make
one
fancy
the
adage
subverted
that
stolen
fruits
are
sweetest
she
drew
such
glowing
pictures
of
bliss
within
the
law
and
the
limits
of
the
conscience
till
at
last
worn
out
lucy
murmured
peepy
dear
berry
and
the
soft
woman
gradually
ceased
her
chirp
bessy
berry
did
not
sleep
she
lay
thinking
of
the
sweet
brave
heart
beside
her
and
listening
to
lucy
breath
as
it
came
and
went
squeezing
the
fair
sleeper
hand
now
and
then
to
ease
her
love
as
her
reflections
warmed
a
storm
of
wind
came
howling
over
the
hampshire
hills
and
sprang
white
foam
on
the
water
and
shook
the
bare
trees
it
passed
leaving
a
thin
cloth
of
snow
on
the
wintry
land
the
moon
shone
brilliantly
berry
heard
the
bark
his
bark
was
savage
and
persistent
she
was
roused
by
the
noise
by
and
by
she
fancied
she
heard
a
movement
in
the
house
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
opened
she
cocked
her
ears
and
could
almost
make
out
voices
in
the
midnight
stillness
she
slipped
from
the
bed
locked
and
bolted
the
door
of
the
room
assured
herself
of
lucy
unconsciousness
and
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
window
the
trees
all
stood
white
to
the
north
the
ground
glittered
the
cold
was
keen
berry
wrapped
her
fat
arms
across
her
bosom
and
peeped
as
close
over
into
the
garden
as
the
situation
of
the
window
permitted
berry
was
a
soft
not
a
timid
woman
and
it
happened
this
night
that
her
thoughts
were
above
the
fears
of
the
dark
she
was
sure
of
the
voices
curiosity
without
a
shade
of
alarm
held
her
on
the
watch
and
gathering
bundles
of
her
round
her
neck
and
shoulders
she
silenced
the
chattering
of
her
teeth
as
well
as
she
could
and
remained
stationary
the
low
hum
of
the
voices
came
to
a
break
something
was
said
in
a
louder
tone
the
quietly
shut
a
man
walked
out
of
the
garden
into
the
road
he
paused
opposite
her
window
and
berry
let
the
blind
go
back
to
its
place
and
peeped
from
behind
an
edge
of
it
he
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
discern
much
of
his
figure
after
some
minutes
he
walked
rapidly
away
and
berry
returned
to
the
bed
an
icicle
from
which
lucy
limbs
sensitively
shrank
next
morning
berry
asked
tom
bakewell
if
he
had
been
disturbed
in
the
night
tom
the
mysterious
said
he
had
slept
like
a
top
berry
went
into
the
garden
the
snow
was
partially
melted
all
save
one
spot
just
under
the
portal
and
there
she
saw
the
print
of
a
man
foot
by
some
strange
guidance
it
occurred
to
her
to
go
and
find
one
of
richard
boots
she
did
so
and
unperceived
she
measured
the
sole
of
the
boot
in
that
solitary
footmark
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
fitted
she
tried
it
from
heel
to
toe
a
dozen
times
chapter
xl
sir
austin
feverel
had
come
to
town
with
the
serenity
of
a
philosopher
who
says
is
now
time
and
the
satisfaction
of
a
man
who
has
not
arrived
thereat
without
a
struggle
he
had
almost
forgiven
his
son
his
deep
love
for
him
had
shaken
loose
from
wounded
pride
and
more
tenacious
vanity
stirrings
of
a
remote
sympathy
for
the
creature
who
had
robbed
him
of
his
son
and
hewed
at
his
system
were
in
his
heart
of
hearts
this
he
knew
and
in
his
own
mind
he
took
credit
for
his
softness
but
the
world
must
not
suppose
him
soft
the
world
must
think
he
was
still
acting
on
his
system
otherwise
what
would
his
long
absence
signify
something
highly
unphilosophical
so
though
love
was
strong
and
was
moving
him
to
a
straightforward
course
the
last
tug
of
vanity
drew
him
still
aslant
the
aphorist
read
himself
so
well
that
to
juggle
with
himself
was
a
necessity
as
he
wished
the
world
to
see
him
he
beheld
himself
one
who
entirely
put
aside
mere
personal
feelings
one
in
whom
parental
duty
based
on
the
science
of
life
was
paramount
a
scientific
humanist
in
short
he
was
therefore
rather
surprised
at
a
coldness
in
lady
manner
when
he
did
appear
at
last
said
the
lady
in
a
sad
way
that
sounded
reproachfully
now
the
scientific
humanist
had
of
course
nothing
to
reproach
himself
with
but
where
was
richard
adrian
positively
averred
he
was
not
with
his
wife
if
he
had
gone
said
the
baronet
he
would
have
anticipated
me
by
a
few
hours
this
when
repeated
to
lady
blandish
should
have
propitiated
her
and
shown
his
great
forgiveness
she
however
sighed
and
looked
at
him
wistfully
their
converse
was
not
happy
and
deeply
intimate
philosophy
did
not
seem
to
catch
her
mind
and
fine
phrases
encountered
a
rueful
assent
more
flattering
to
their
grandeur
than
to
their
influence
days
went
by
richard
did
not
present
himself
sir
austin
pitch
of
was
to
await
the
youth
without
signs
of
impatience
seeing
this
the
lady
told
him
her
fears
for
richard
and
mentioned
the
rumour
of
him
that
was
about
if
said
the
baronet
this
person
his
wife
is
what
you
paint
her
i
do
not
share
your
fears
for
him
i
think
too
well
of
him
if
she
is
one
to
inspire
the
sacredness
of
that
union
i
think
too
well
of
him
it
is
impossible
the
lady
saw
one
thing
to
be
done
call
her
to
you
she
said
have
her
with
you
at
raynham
recognize
her
it
is
the
disunion
and
doubt
that
so
confuses
him
and
drives
him
wild
i
confess
to
you
i
hoped
he
had
gone
to
her
it
seems
not
if
she
is
with
you
his
way
will
be
clear
will
you
do
that
science
is
notoriously
of
slow
movement
lady
blandish
proposition
was
far
too
hasty
for
sir
austin
women
rapid
by
nature
have
no
idea
of
science
we
shall
see
her
there
in
time
emmeline
at
present
let
it
be
between
me
and
my
son
he
spoke
loftily
in
truth
it
offended
him
to
be
asked
to
do
anything
when
he
had
just
brought
himself
to
do
so
much
a
month
elapsed
and
richard
appeared
on
the
scene
the
meeting
between
him
and
his
father
was
not
what
his
father
had
expected
and
had
crooned
over
in
the
welsh
mountains
richard
shook
his
hand
respectfully
and
inquired
after
his
health
with
the
common
social
solicitude
he
then
said
during
your
absence
sir
i
have
taken
the
liberty
without
consulting
you
to
do
something
in
which
you
are
more
deeply
concerned
than
myself
i
have
taken
upon
myself
to
find
out
my
mother
and
place
her
under
my
care
i
trust
you
will
not
think
i
have
done
wrong
i
acted
as
i
thought
best
sir
austin
replied
you
are
of
an
age
richard
to
judge
for
yourself
in
such
a
case
i
would
have
you
simply
beware
of
deceiving
yourself
in
imagining
that
you
considered
any
one
but
yourself
in
acting
as
you
did
i
have
not
deceived
myself
sir
said
richard
and
the
interview
was
over
both
hated
an
exposure
of
the
feelings
and
in
that
both
were
satisfied
but
the
baronet
as
one
who
loves
hoped
and
looked
for
tones
indicative
of
trouble
and
delight
in
the
deep
heart
and
richard
gave
him
none
of
those
the
young
man
did
not
even
face
him
as
he
spoke
if
their
eyes
met
by
chance
richard
were
defiantly
cold
his
whole
bearing
was
changed
this
rash
marriage
has
altered
him
said
the
very
just
man
of
science
in
life
and
that
meant
it
has
debased
him
he
pursued
his
reflections
i
see
in
him
the
desperate
maturity
of
a
nature
and
but
for
my
faith
that
good
work
is
never
lost
what
should
i
think
of
the
toil
of
my
years
lost
perhaps
to
me
lost
to
him
it
may
show
itself
in
his
children
the
philosopher
we
may
conceive
has
contentment
in
benefiting
embryos
but
it
was
a
somewhat
bitter
prospect
to
sir
austin
bitterly
he
felt
the
injury
to
himself
one
little
incident
spoke
well
of
richard
a
poor
woman
called
at
the
hotel
while
he
was
missing
the
baronet
saw
her
and
she
told
him
a
tale
that
threw
christian
light
on
one
part
of
richard
nature
but
this
might
gratify
the
father
in
sir
austin
it
did
not
touch
the
man
of
science
a
feverel
his
son
would
not
do
less
he
thought
he
sat
down
deliberately
to
study
his
son
no
definite
observations
enlightened
him
richard
ate
and
drank
joked
and
laughed
he
was
generally
before
adrian
in
calling
for
a
fresh
bottle
he
talked
easily
of
current
topics
his
gaiety
did
not
sound
forced
in
all
he
did
nevertheless
there
was
not
the
air
of
a
youth
who
sees
a
future
before
him
sir
austin
put
that
down
it
might
be
carelessness
and
wanton
blood
for
no
one
could
say
he
had
much
on
his
mind
the
man
of
science
was
not
reckoning
that
richard
also
might
have
learned
to
act
and
wear
a
mask
dead
subjects
this
is
to
say
people
not
on
their
guard
he
could
penetrate
and
dissect
it
is
by
a
rare
chance
as
scientific
men
well
know
that
one
has
an
opportunity
of
examining
the
structure
of
the
living
however
that
rare
chance
was
granted
to
sir
austin
they
were
engaged
to
dine
with
doria
at
the
foreys
and
walked
down
to
her
in
the
afternoon
father
and
son
adrian
beside
them
previously
the
offended
father
had
condescended
to
inform
his
son
that
it
would
shortly
be
time
for
him
to
return
to
his
wife
indicating
that
arrangements
would
ultimately
be
ordered
to
receive
her
at
raynham
richard
had
replied
nothing
which
might
mean
excess
of
gratitude
or
hypocrisy
in
concealing
his
pleasure
or
any
one
of
the
thousand
shifts
by
which
gratified
human
nature
expresses
itself
when
all
is
made
to
run
smooth
with
it
now
berry
had
her
surprise
ready
charged
for
the
young
husband
she
had
lucy
in
her
own
house
waiting
for
him
every
day
she
expected
him
to
call
and
be
overcome
by
the
rapturous
surprise
and
every
day
knowing
his
habit
of
frequenting
the
park
she
marched
lucy
thither
under
the
plea
that
master
richard
whom
she
had
already
christened
should
have
an
airing
the
round
of
the
red
winter
sun
was
behind
the
bare
kensington
chestnuts
when
these
two
parties
met
happily
for
lucy
and
the
hope
she
bore
in
her
bosom
she
was
perversely
admiring
a
fair
horsewoman
galloping
by
at
the
moment
berry
plucked
at
her
gown
once
or
twice
to
prepare
her
eyes
for
the
shock
but
lucy
head
was
still
half
averted
and
thinks
berry
two
hurt
her
if
she
go
into
his
arms
head
foremost
they
were
close
berry
performed
the
bob
preliminary
richard
held
her
silent
with
a
terrible
face
he
grasped
her
arm
and
put
her
behind
him
other
people
intervened
lucy
saw
nothing
to
account
for
excessive
flutter
berry
threw
it
on
the
air
and
some
breakfast
bacon
which
she
said
she
knew
in
the
morning
while
she
ate
it
was
bad
for
the
bile
and
which
probably
was
the
cause
of
her
bursting
into
tears
much
to
lucy
astonishment
what
you
ate
makes
you
cry
mrs
berry
it
all
berry
pressed
at
her
heart
and
leaned
sideways
all
stomach
my
dear
do
ye
mind
and
becoming
aware
of
her
unfashionable
behaviour
she
trailed
off
to
the
shelter
of
the
elms
you
have
a
singular
manner
with
old
ladies
said
sir
austin
to
his
son
after
berry
had
been
swept
aside
scarcely
courteous
she
behaved
like
a
mad
woman
certainly
are
you
ill
my
son
richard
was
his
strong
form
smitten
through
with
weakness
the
baronet
sought
adrian
eye
adrian
had
seen
lucy
as
they
passed
and
he
had
a
glimpse
of
richard
countenance
while
disposing
of
berry
had
lucy
recognized
them
he
would
have
gone
to
her
unhesitatingly
as
she
did
not
he
thought
it
well
under
the
circumstances
to
leave
matters
as
they
were
he
answered
the
baronet
look
with
a
shrug
are
you
ill
richard
sir
austin
again
asked
his
son
come
on
sir
come
on
cried
richard
his
father
further
meditations
as
they
stepped
briskly
to
the
foreys
gave
poor
ferry
a
character
which
one
who
lectures
on
matrimony
and
has
kissed
but
three
men
in
her
life
shrieks
to
hear
the
very
title
of
richard
will
go
to
his
wife
sir
austin
said
to
adrian
some
time
before
they
went
in
to
dinner
adrian
asked
him
if
he
had
chanced
to
see
a
young
lady
by
the
side
of
the
old
one
richard
had
treated
so
peculiarly
and
to
the
baronet
acknowledgment
that
he
remembered
to
have
observed
such
a
person
adrian
said
that
was
his
wife
sir
sir
austin
could
not
dissect
the
living
subject
as
if
a
bullet
had
torn
open
the
young
man
skull
and
some
blast
of
battle
laid
his
palpitating
organization
bare
he
watched
every
motion
of
his
brain
and
his
heart
and
with
the
grief
and
terror
of
one
whose
mental
habit
was
ever
to
pierce
to
extremes
not
altogether
conscious
that
he
had
hitherto
played
with
life
he
felt
that
he
was
suddenly
plunged
into
the
stormful
reality
of
it
he
projected
to
speak
plainly
to
his
son
on
all
points
that
night
richard
is
very
gay
doris
whispered
her
brother
all
will
be
right
with
him
he
replied
for
the
game
had
been
in
his
hands
so
long
so
long
had
he
been
the
god
of
the
machine
that
having
once
resolved
to
speak
plainly
and
to
act
he
was
to
a
certain
extent
secure
bad
as
the
thing
to
mend
might
be
i
notice
he
has
rather
a
wild
laugh
i
do
exactly
like
his
eyes
said
doria
you
will
see
a
change
in
him
the
man
of
science
remarked
it
was
reserved
for
doria
herself
to
experience
that
change
in
the
middle
of
the
dinner
a
telegraphic
message
from
her
worthy
john
todhunter
reached
the
house
stating
that
clare
was
alarmingly
ill
bidding
her
come
instantly
she
cast
about
for
some
one
to
accompany
her
and
fixed
on
richard
before
he
would
give
his
consent
for
richard
to
go
sir
austin
desired
to
speak
with
him
apart
and
in
that
interview
he
said
to
his
son
my
dear
richard
it
was
my
intention
that
we
should
come
to
an
understanding
together
this
night
but
the
time
is
short
poor
helen
can
not
spare
many
minutes
let
me
then
say
that
you
deceived
me
and
that
i
forgive
you
we
fix
our
seal
on
the
past
you
will
bring
your
wife
to
me
when
you
return
and
very
cheerfully
the
baronet
looked
down
on
the
generous
future
he
thus
founded
will
you
have
her
at
raynham
at
once
sir
said
richard
yes
my
son
when
you
bring
her
are
you
mocking
me
sir
pray
what
do
you
mean
i
ask
you
to
receive
her
at
once
well
the
delay
can
not
be
long
i
do
not
apprehend
that
you
will
be
kept
from
your
happiness
many
days
i
think
it
will
be
some
time
sir
said
richard
sighing
deeply
and
what
mental
freak
is
this
that
can
induce
you
to
postpone
it
and
play
with
your
first
duty
what
is
my
first
duty
sir
since
you
are
married
to
be
with
your
wife
i
have
heard
that
from
an
old
woman
called
berry
said
richard
to
himself
not
intending
irony
will
you
receive
her
at
once
he
asked
resolutely
the
baronet
was
clouded
by
his
son
reception
of
his
graciousness
his
grateful
prospect
had
formerly
been
richard
marriage
the
culmination
of
his
system
richard
had
destroyed
his
participation
in
that
he
now
looked
for
a
pretty
scene
in
recompense
richard
leading
up
his
wife
to
him
and
both
being
welcomed
by
him
paternally
and
so
held
one
ostentatious
minute
in
his
embrace
he
said
before
you
return
i
demur
to
receiving
her
very
well
sir
replied
his
son
and
stood
as
if
he
had
spoken
all
really
you
tempt
me
to
fancy
you
already
regret
your
rash
proceeding
the
baronet
exclaimed
and
the
next
moment
it
pained
him
he
had
uttered
the
words
richard
eyes
were
so
sorrowfully
fierce
it
pained
him
but
he
divined
in
that
look
a
history
and
he
could
not
refrain
from
glancing
acutely
and
asking
do
you
regret
it
sir
the
question
aroused
one
of
those
struggles
in
the
young
man
breast
which
a
passionate
storm
of
tears
may
still
and
which
sink
like
leaden
death
into
the
soul
when
tears
come
not
richard
eyes
had
the
light
of
the
desert
do
you
his
father
repeated
you
tempt
me
i
almost
fear
you
do
at
the
thought
for
he
expressed
his
mind
the
pity
that
he
had
for
richard
was
not
pure
gold
ask
me
what
i
think
of
her
sir
ask
me
what
she
is
ask
me
what
it
is
to
have
taken
one
of
god
precious
angels
and
chained
her
to
misery
ask
me
what
it
is
to
have
plunged
a
sword
into
her
heart
and
to
stand
over
her
and
see
such
a
creature
bleeding
do
i
regret
that
why
yes
i
do
would
you
his
eyes
flew
hard
at
his
father
under
the
ridge
of
his
eyebrows
sir
austin
winced
and
reddened
did
he
understand
there
is
ever
in
the
mind
eye
a
certain
wilfulness
we
see
and
understand
we
see
and
understand
tell
me
why
you
passed
by
her
as
you
did
this
afternoon
he
said
gravely
and
in
the
same
voice
richard
answered
i
passed
her
because
i
could
not
do
otherwise
your
wife
richard
yes
my
wife
if
she
had
seen
you
richard
god
spared
her
that
doria
bustling
in
practical
haste
and
bearing
richard
hat
and
greatcoat
in
her
energetic
hands
came
between
them
at
this
juncture
dimples
of
commiseration
were
in
her
cheeks
while
she
kissed
her
brother
perplexed
forehead
she
forgot
her
trouble
about
clare
deploring
his
fatuity
sir
austin
was
forced
to
let
his
son
depart
as
of
old
he
took
counsel
with
adrian
and
the
wise
youth
was
soothing
somebody
has
kissed
him
sir
and
the
chaste
boy
ca
get
over
it
this
absurd
suggestion
did
more
to
appease
the
baronet
than
if
adrian
had
given
a
veritable
reasonable
key
to
richard
conduct
it
set
him
thinking
that
it
might
be
a
prudish
strain
in
the
young
man
mind
due
to
the
system
in
difficulties
i
may
have
been
wrong
in
one
thing
he
said
with
an
air
of
the
utmost
doubt
of
it
i
perhaps
was
wrong
in
allowing
him
so
much
liberty
during
his
probation
adrian
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
had
distinctly
commanded
it
yes
yes
that
is
on
me
his
was
an
order
of
mind
that
would
accept
the
most
burdensome
charges
and
by
some
species
of
moral
usury
make
a
profit
out
of
them
clare
was
little
talked
of
adrian
attributed
the
employment
of
the
telegraph
to
john
todhunter
uxorious
distress
at
a
toothache
or
possibly
the
first
symptoms
of
an
heir
to
his
house
that
child
mind
has
disease
in
it
she
is
not
sound
said
the
baronet
on
the
of
the
hotel
when
they
returned
stood
berry
her
wish
to
speak
a
few
words
with
the
baronet
reverentially
communicated
she
was
ushered
upstairs
into
his
room
berry
compressed
her
person
in
the
chair
she
was
beckoned
to
occupy
well
you
have
something
to
say
observed
the
baronet
for
she
seemed
loth
to
commence
wishin
i
had
berry
took
him
up
and
mindful
of
the
good
rule
to
begin
at
the
beginning
pursued
i
dare
say
sir
austin
you
remember
me
and
i
little
thought
when
last
we
parted
our
meeting
be
like
this
twenty
year
do
go
over
one
without
showin
it
no
more
than
twenty
ox
it
a
might
o
time
twenty
year
leastways
not
quite
twenty
it
ai
round
figures
are
best
adrian
remarked
in
them
round
figures
a
son
have
growed
up
and
got
himself
married
said
berry
diving
straight
into
the
case
sir
austin
then
learnt
that
he
had
before
him
the
culprit
who
had
assisted
his
son
in
that
venture
it
was
a
stretch
of
his
patience
to
hear
himself
addressed
on
a
family
matter
but
he
was
naturally
courteous
he
came
to
my
house
sir
austin
a
stranger
if
twenty
year
alters
us
as
have
knowed
each
other
on
the
earth
how
must
they
alter
they
that
we
parted
with
just
come
from
heaven
and
a
heavenly
babe
he
were
so
sweet
so
strong
so
fat
adrian
laughed
aloud
berry
bumped
a
curtsey
to
him
in
her
chair
continuing
i
wished
afore
i
spoke
to
say
how
thankful
am
i
bound
to
be
for
my
pension
not
cut
short
as
have
offended
so
but
that
i
know
sir
austin
feverel
raynham
abbey
ai
one
o
them
that
likes
to
hear
their
good
deeds
pumlished
and
a
pension
to
me
now
it
something
more
than
it
were
for
a
pension
and
pretty
rosy
cheeks
in
a
maid
which
i
was
that
a
bait
many
a
man
bite
that
wo
so
a
forsaken
wife
if
you
will
speak
to
the
point
i
will
listen
to
you
the
baronet
interrupted
her
it
the
beginnin
that
the
worst
and
that
over
thank
the
lord
so
i
speak
sir
austin
and
say
my
say
lord
speed
me
believin
our
idees
o
matrimony
to
be
then
i
say
once
married
married
for
life
yes
i
do
even
like
widows
for
i
ca
stop
at
the
grave
not
at
the
tomb
i
ca
stop
my
husband
my
husband
and
if
i
a
body
at
the
resurrection
i
say
speaking
humbly
my
berry
is
the
husband
o
my
body
and
to
think
of
two
claimin
of
me
then
it
makes
me
hot
all
over
such
is
my
notion
of
that
state
man
and
woman
no
givin
in
marriage
o
course
i
know
and
if
so
i
single
the
baronet
suppressed
a
smile
really
my
good
woman
you
wander
very
much
beggin
pardon
sir
austin
but
i
has
my
point
before
me
all
the
same
and
i
comin
to
it
our
error
it
done
and
done
it
writ
aloft
oh
if
you
ony
knew
what
a
sweet
young
creature
she
be
indeed
all
of
humble
birth
that
unworthy
sir
austin
and
she
got
her
idees
too
she
reads
history
she
talk
that
sensible
as
would
surprise
ye
but
for
all
that
she
a
prey
to
the
artful
o
men
unpertected
and
it
a
young
marriage
but
there
no
fear
for
her
as
far
as
she
go
the
fear
way
there
that
in
a
man
at
the
commencement
which
make
of
him
lord
knows
what
if
you
any
way
interferes
whereas
a
woman
bides
quiet
it
consolation
catch
her
which
is
what
we
mean
by
seduein
whereas
a
man
he
a
savage
sir
austin
turned
his
face
to
adrian
who
was
listening
with
huge
delight
well
i
see
you
have
something
in
your
mind
if
you
would
only
come
to
it
quickly
then
here
my
point
sir
austin
i
say
you
bred
him
so
as
there
another
young
gentleman
like
him
in
england
and
proud
he
make
me
and
as
for
her
i
risk
sayin
it
done
and
no
harm
you
might
search
england
through
and
nowhere
will
ye
find
a
maid
that
his
match
like
his
own
wife
then
there
they
be
are
they
together
as
should
be
o
lord
no
months
they
been
divided
then
she
all
lonely
and
exposed
i
went
and
fetched
her
out
of
seducers
ways
which
they
may
say
what
they
like
but
the
is
most
open
to
when
they
healthy
and
confidin
i
fetch
her
and
the
liberty
boxed
her
safe
in
my
own
house
so
much
for
that
sweet
that
you
may
do
with
women
but
it
him
richard
i
am
bold
i
know
but
there
i
in
for
it
and
the
help
me
it
him
sir
austin
in
this
great
metropolis
warm
from
a
young
marriage
it
him
and
i
say
nothin
of
her
and
how
sweet
she
bears
it
and
it
eating
her
at
a
time
when
natur
should
have
no
other
trouble
but
the
one
that
goin
on
it
him
and
i
ask
so
bold
shall
there
and
a
christian
gentlemen
his
father
shall
there
be
a
tug
him
as
a
son
and
him
as
a
husband
soon
to
be
somethin
else
i
speak
bold
out
i
have
sons
obey
their
fathers
but
a
priest
words
spoke
over
them
which
they
now
in
my
ears
i
say
i
ai
a
doubt
on
earth
i
sure
there
ai
one
in
heaven
which
dooty
the
holier
of
the
two
sir
austin
heard
her
to
an
end
their
views
on
the
junction
of
the
sexes
were
undoubtedly
akin
to
be
lectured
on
his
prime
subject
however
was
slightly
disagreeable
and
to
be
obliged
mentally
to
assent
to
this
old
lady
doctrine
was
rather
humiliating
when
it
could
not
be
averred
that
he
had
latterly
followed
it
out
he
sat
and
silent
a
finger
to
his
temple
one
gets
so
thinkin
many
things
said
berry
simply
that
why
we
see
wonder
clever
people
goin
wrong
to
my
mind
i
think
it
the
plan
in
a
dielemmer
to
pray
god
and
walk
forward
the
soft
woman
was
tracking
the
baronet
thoughts
and
she
had
absolutely
run
him
down
and
taken
an
explanation
out
of
his
mouth
by
which
berry
was
to
have
been
informed
that
he
had
acted
from
a
principle
of
his
own
and
devolved
a
wisdom
she
could
not
be
expected
to
comprehend
of
course
he
became
advised
immediately
that
it
would
be
waste
of
time
to
direct
such
an
explanation
to
her
inferior
capacity
he
gave
her
his
hand
saying
my
son
has
gone
out
of
town
to
see
his
cousin
who
is
ill
he
will
return
in
two
or
three
days
and
then
they
will
both
come
to
me
at
raynham
berry
took
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
went
to
the
floor
perpendicularly
he
pass
her
like
a
stranger
in
the
park
this
evenin
she
faltered
ah
said
the
baronet
yes
well
they
will
be
at
raynham
before
the
week
is
over
berry
was
not
quite
satisfied
not
of
his
own
accord
he
pass
that
sweet
young
wife
of
his
like
a
stranger
this
day
sir
austin
i
must
beg
you
not
to
intrude
further
berry
bobbed
her
bunch
of
a
body
out
of
the
room
all
well
that
ends
well
she
said
to
herself
it
just
bad
inquirin
too
close
among
men
we
must
take
somethin
like
providence
as
they
come
thank
heaven
i
kep
back
the
baby
in
berry
eyes
the
baby
was
the
victorious
reserve
adrian
asked
his
chief
what
he
thought
of
that
specimen
of
woman
i
think
i
have
not
met
a
better
in
my
life
said
the
baronet
mingling
praise
and
sarcasm
clare
lies
in
her
bed
as
placid
as
in
the
days
when
she
breathed
her
white
hands
stretched
their
length
along
the
sheets
at
peace
from
head
to
feet
she
needs
iron
no
more
richard
is
face
to
face
with
death
for
the
first
time
he
sees
the
sculpture
of
clay
the
spark
gone
clare
gave
her
mother
the
welcome
of
the
dead
this
child
would
have
spoken
nothing
but
kind
commonplaces
had
she
been
alive
she
was
dead
and
none
knew
her
malady
on
her
fourth
finger
were
two
when
hours
of
weeping
had
silenced
the
mother
anguish
she
for
some
comfort
she
saw
in
it
pointed
out
that
strange
thing
to
richard
speaking
low
in
the
chamber
of
the
dead
and
then
he
learnt
that
it
was
his
own
lost
ring
clare
wore
in
the
two
worlds
he
learnt
from
her
husband
that
clare
last
request
had
been
that
neither
of
the
rings
should
be
removed
she
had
written
it
she
would
not
speak
it
i
beg
of
my
husband
and
all
kind
people
who
may
have
the
care
of
me
between
this
and
the
grave
to
bury
me
with
my
hands
untouched
the
tracing
of
the
words
showed
the
bodily
torment
she
was
suffering
as
she
wrote
them
on
a
scrap
of
paper
found
beside
her
pillow
in
wonder
as
the
dim
idea
grew
from
the
waving
of
clare
dead
hand
richard
paced
the
house
and
hung
about
the
awful
room
dreading
to
enter
it
reluctant
to
quit
it
the
secret
clare
had
buried
while
she
lived
arose
with
her
death
he
saw
it
play
like
flame
across
her
marble
features
the
memory
of
her
voice
was
like
a
knife
at
his
nerves
his
coldness
to
her
started
up
accusingly
her
meekness
was
bitter
blame
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
her
mother
came
to
him
in
his
bedroom
with
a
face
so
white
that
he
asked
himself
if
aught
worse
could
happen
to
a
mother
than
the
loss
of
her
child
choking
she
said
to
him
read
this
and
thrust
a
trembling
in
his
hand
she
would
not
breathe
to
him
what
it
was
she
entreated
him
not
to
open
it
before
her
tell
me
she
said
tell
me
what
you
think
john
must
not
hear
of
it
i
have
nobody
to
consult
but
you
o
richard
my
diary
was
written
in
the
round
hand
of
clare
childhood
on
the
first
page
the
first
name
his
eye
encountered
was
his
own
richard
fourteenth
birthday
i
have
worked
him
a
purse
and
put
it
under
his
pillow
because
he
is
going
to
have
plenty
of
money
he
does
not
notice
me
now
because
he
has
a
friend
now
and
he
is
ugly
but
richard
is
not
and
never
will
be
the
occurrences
of
that
day
were
subsequently
recorded
and
a
childish
prayer
to
god
for
him
set
down
step
by
step
he
saw
her
growing
mind
in
his
history
as
she
advanced
in
years
she
began
to
look
back
and
made
much
of
little
trivial
remembrances
all
bearing
upon
him
we
went
into
the
fields
and
gathered
cowslips
together
and
pelted
each
other
and
i
told
him
he
used
to
call
them
when
he
was
a
baby
and
he
was
angry
at
my
telling
him
for
he
does
not
like
to
be
told
he
was
ever
a
baby
he
remembered
the
incident
and
remembered
his
stupid
scorn
of
her
meek
affection
little
clare
how
she
lived
before
him
in
her
white
dress
and
pink
ribbons
and
soft
dark
eyes
upstairs
she
was
lying
dead
he
read
on
mama
says
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
like
richard
and
i
am
sure
there
is
not
not
in
the
whole
world
he
says
he
is
going
to
be
a
great
general
and
going
to
the
wars
if
he
does
i
shall
dress
myself
as
a
boy
and
go
after
him
and
he
will
not
know
me
till
i
am
wounded
oh
i
pray
he
will
never
never
be
wounded
i
wonder
what
i
should
feel
if
richard
was
ever
to
die
upstairs
clare
was
lying
dead
lady
blandish
said
there
was
a
likeness
between
richard
and
me
richard
said
i
hope
i
do
not
hang
down
my
head
as
she
does
he
is
angry
with
me
because
i
do
not
look
people
in
the
face
and
speak
out
but
i
know
i
am
not
looking
after
earthworms
yes
he
had
told
her
that
a
shiver
seized
him
at
the
recollection
then
it
came
to
a
period
when
the
words
richard
kissed
me
stood
by
themselves
and
marked
a
day
in
her
life
afterwards
it
was
solemnly
discovered
that
richard
wrote
poetry
he
read
one
of
his
old
forgotten
compositions
penned
when
he
had
that
ambition
thy
truth
to
me
is
truer
than
horse
or
dog
or
blade
thy
vows
to
me
are
fewer
than
ever
maiden
made
thou
steppest
from
thy
splendour
to
make
my
life
a
song
my
bosom
shall
be
tender
as
thine
has
risen
strong
all
the
verses
were
transcribed
it
is
he
who
is
the
humble
knight
clare
explained
at
the
close
and
his
lady
is
a
queen
any
queen
would
throw
her
crown
away
for
him
it
came
to
that
period
when
clare
left
raynham
with
her
mother
richard
was
not
sorry
to
lose
me
he
only
loves
boys
and
men
something
tells
me
i
shall
never
see
raynham
again
he
was
dressed
in
blue
he
said
clare
and
kissed
me
on
the
cheek
richard
never
kisses
me
on
the
mouth
he
did
not
know
i
went
to
his
bed
and
kissed
him
while
he
was
asleep
he
sleeps
with
one
arm
under
his
head
and
the
other
out
on
the
bed
i
moved
away
a
bit
of
his
hair
that
was
over
his
eyes
i
wanted
to
cut
it
i
have
one
piece
i
do
not
let
anybody
see
i
am
unhappy
not
even
mama
she
says
i
want
iron
i
am
sure
i
do
not
i
like
to
write
my
name
clare
doria
forey
is
richard
doria
feverel
his
breast
rose
convulsively
clare
doria
forey
he
knew
the
music
of
that
name
he
had
heard
it
somewhere
it
sounded
faint
and
mellow
now
behind
the
hills
of
death
he
could
not
read
for
tears
it
was
midnight
the
hour
seemed
to
belong
to
her
the
awful
stillness
and
the
darkness
were
clare
voice
clear
and
cold
from
the
grave
possessed
it
painfully
with
blinded
eyes
he
looked
over
the
breathless
pages
she
spoke
of
his
marriage
and
her
finding
the
ring
i
knew
it
was
his
i
knew
he
was
going
to
be
married
that
morning
i
saw
him
stand
by
the
altar
when
they
laughed
at
breakfast
his
wife
must
be
so
beautiful
richard
wife
perhaps
he
will
love
me
better
now
he
is
married
mama
says
they
must
be
separated
that
is
shameful
if
i
can
help
him
i
will
i
pray
so
that
he
may
be
happy
i
hope
god
hears
poor
sinners
prayers
i
am
very
sinful
nobody
knows
it
as
i
do
they
say
i
am
good
but
i
know
when
i
look
on
the
ground
i
am
not
looking
after
earthworms
as
he
said
oh
do
forgive
me
god
then
she
spoke
of
her
own
marriage
and
that
it
was
her
duty
to
obey
her
mother
a
blank
in
the
diary
ensued
i
have
seen
richard
richard
despises
me
was
the
next
entry
but
now
as
he
read
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
the
delicate
feminine
handwriting
like
a
black
thread
drew
on
his
soul
to
one
terrible
conclusion
i
can
not
live
richard
despises
me
i
can
not
bear
the
touch
of
my
fingers
or
the
sight
of
my
face
oh
i
understand
him
now
he
should
not
have
kissed
me
so
that
last
time
i
wished
to
die
while
his
mouth
was
on
mine
further
i
have
no
escape
richard
said
he
would
die
rather
than
endure
it
i
know
he
would
why
should
i
be
afraid
to
do
what
he
would
do
i
think
if
my
husband
whipped
me
i
could
bear
it
better
he
is
so
kind
and
tries
to
make
me
cheerful
he
will
soon
be
very
unhappy
i
pray
to
god
half
the
night
i
seem
to
be
losing
sight
of
my
god
the
more
i
pray
richard
laid
the
book
open
on
the
table
phantom
surges
seemed
to
be
mounting
and
travelling
for
his
brain
had
clare
taken
his
wild
words
in
earnest
did
she
lie
there
dead
he
shrouded
the
thought
he
wrapped
the
thoughts
in
shrouds
but
he
was
again
reading
a
quarter
to
one
i
shall
not
be
alive
this
time
i
shall
never
see
richard
now
i
dreamed
last
night
we
were
in
the
fields
together
and
he
walked
with
his
arm
round
my
waist
we
were
children
but
i
thought
we
were
married
and
i
showed
him
i
wore
his
ring
and
he
said
if
you
always
wear
it
clare
you
are
as
good
as
my
wife
then
i
made
a
vow
to
wear
it
for
ever
and
ever
it
is
not
mama
fault
she
does
not
think
as
richard
and
i
do
of
these
things
he
is
not
a
coward
nor
am
i
he
hates
cowards
i
have
written
to
his
father
to
make
him
happy
perhaps
when
i
am
dead
he
will
hear
what
i
say
i
heard
just
now
richard
call
distinctly
clare
come
out
to
me
surely
he
has
not
gone
i
am
going
i
know
not
where
i
can
not
think
i
am
very
cold
the
words
were
written
larger
and
staggered
towards
the
close
as
if
her
hand
had
lost
mastery
over
the
pen
i
can
only
remember
richard
now
a
boy
a
little
boy
and
a
big
boy
i
am
not
sure
now
of
his
voice
i
can
only
remember
certain
words
and
ricardo
and
his
laugh
he
used
to
be
full
of
fun
once
we
laughed
all
day
together
tumbling
in
the
hay
then
he
had
a
friend
and
began
to
write
poetry
and
be
proud
if
i
had
married
a
young
man
he
would
have
forgiven
me
but
i
should
not
have
been
happier
i
must
have
died
god
never
looks
on
me
it
is
past
two
the
sheep
are
bleating
outside
it
must
be
very
cold
in
the
ground
richard
with
his
name
it
began
and
ended
even
to
herself
clare
was
not
communicative
the
book
was
slender
yet
her
nineteen
years
of
existence
left
half
the
number
of
pages
white
those
last
words
drew
him
irresistibly
to
gaze
on
her
there
she
lay
the
same
impassive
clare
for
a
moment
he
wondered
she
had
not
moved
to
him
she
had
become
so
different
she
who
had
just
filled
his
ears
with
strange
tidings
it
was
not
possible
to
think
her
dead
she
seemed
to
have
been
speaking
to
him
all
through
his
life
his
image
was
on
that
still
heart
he
dismissed
the
from
the
room
and
remained
with
her
alone
till
the
sense
of
death
oppressed
him
and
then
the
shock
sent
him
to
the
window
to
look
for
sky
and
stars
behind
a
low
broad
pine
hung
with
frosty
mist
he
heard
a
of
the
flock
in
the
silent
fold
death
in
life
it
sounded
the
mother
found
him
praying
at
the
foot
of
clare
bed
she
knelt
by
his
side
and
they
prayed
and
their
joint
sobs
shook
their
bodies
but
neither
of
them
shed
many
tears
they
held
a
dark
unspoken
secret
in
common
they
prayed
god
to
forgive
her
clare
was
buried
in
the
family
vault
of
the
todhunters
her
mother
breathed
no
wish
to
have
her
lying
at
lobourne
after
the
funeral
what
they
alone
upon
earth
knew
brought
them
together
richard
she
said
the
worst
is
over
for
me
i
have
no
one
to
love
but
you
dear
we
have
all
been
fighting
against
god
and
this
richard
you
will
come
with
me
and
be
united
to
your
wife
and
spare
my
brother
what
i
suffer
he
answered
the
broken
spirit
i
have
killed
one
she
sees
me
as
i
am
i
can
not
go
with
you
to
my
wife
because
i
am
not
worthy
to
touch
her
hand
and
were
i
to
go
i
should
do
this
to
silence
my
go
you
to
her
and
when
she
asks
of
me
say
i
have
a
death
upon
my
head
that
no
say
that
i
am
abroad
seeking
for
that
which
shall
cleanse
me
if
i
find
it
i
shall
come
to
claim
her
if
not
god
help
us
all
she
had
no
strength
to
contest
his
solemn
words
or
stay
him
and
he
went
forth
chapter
xli
a
man
with
a
beard
saluted
the
wise
youth
adrian
in
the
full
blaze
of
piccadilly
with
a
clap
on
the
shoulder
adrian
glanced
leisurely
behind
do
you
want
to
try
my
nerves
my
dear
fellow
i
not
a
man
of
fashion
happily
or
you
would
have
struck
the
seat
of
them
how
are
you
that
was
his
welcome
to
austin
wentworth
after
his
long
absence
austin
took
his
arm
and
asked
for
news
with
the
hunger
of
one
who
had
been
in
the
wilderness
five
years
the
whigs
have
given
up
the
ghost
my
dear
austin
the
free
briton
is
to
receive
liberty
pearl
the
ballot
the
aristocracy
has
had
a
cycle
notice
to
quit
the
monarchy
and
old
madeira
are
going
out
demos
and
cape
wines
are
coming
in
they
call
it
reform
so
you
see
your
absence
has
worked
wonders
depart
for
another
five
years
and
you
will
return
to
ruined
stomachs
cracked
sconces
general
upset
an
equality
made
perfect
by
universal
prostration
austin
indulged
him
in
a
laugh
i
want
to
hear
about
ourselves
how
is
old
ricky
you
know
of
his
what
do
they
call
it
when
greenhorns
are
licensed
to
jump
into
the
milkpails
of
dairymaids
a
very
charming
little
woman
she
makes
by
the
way
presentable
quite
old
anacreon
rose
in
milk
well
everybody
thought
the
system
must
die
of
it
not
a
bit
it
continued
to
flourish
in
spite
it
in
a
consumption
now
though
emaciated
lean
raw
spectral
i
this
morning
escaped
from
raynham
to
avoid
the
sight
of
it
i
have
brought
our
genial
uncle
hippias
to
town
a
delightful
companion
i
said
to
him
had
a
fine
spring
he
answers
a
time
when
you
come
to
think
the
spring
old
you
should
have
heard
how
he
trained
out
the
i
felt
something
like
decay
in
my
sap
just
to
hear
him
in
the
of
life
my
dear
austin
our
uncle
hippias
has
been
unfairly
hit
below
the
belt
let
guard
ourselves
there
and
go
and
order
dinner
but
where
ricky
now
and
what
is
he
doing
said
austin
ask
what
he
has
done
the
miraculous
boy
has
gone
and
got
a
baby
a
child
richard
has
one
austin
clear
eyes
shone
with
pleasure
i
suppose
it
not
common
among
your
tropical
savages
he
has
one
one
as
big
as
two
that
has
been
the
to
the
system
it
bore
the
marriage
the
baby
was
too
much
for
it
could
it
swallow
the
baby
live
she
the
wonderful
woman
has
produced
a
large
boy
i
assure
you
it
quite
amusing
to
see
the
system
opening
its
mouth
every
hour
of
the
day
trying
to
gulp
him
down
aware
that
it
would
be
a
consummate
cure
or
a
happy
release
by
degrees
austin
learnt
the
baronet
proceedings
and
smiled
sadly
how
has
ricky
turned
out
he
asked
what
sort
of
a
character
has
he
the
poor
boy
is
ruined
by
his
excessive
anxiety
about
it
character
he
has
the
character
of
a
bullet
with
a
treble
charge
of
powder
behind
it
enthusiasm
is
the
powder
that
boy
could
get
up
an
enthusiasm
for
the
maiden
days
of
ops
he
was
going
to
reform
the
world
after
your
fashion
austin
you
have
something
to
answer
for
unfortunately
he
began
with
the
feminine
side
of
it
cupid
proud
of
phoebus
newly
slain
or
pluto
wishing
to
people
his
kingdom
if
you
like
put
it
into
the
soft
head
of
one
of
the
guileless
grateful
creatures
to
kiss
him
for
his
good
work
oh
horror
he
never
expected
that
conceive
the
system
in
the
flesh
and
you
have
our
richard
the
consequence
is
that
this
male
peri
refuses
to
enter
his
paradise
though
the
gates
are
open
for
him
the
trumpets
blow
and
the
fair
unspotted
one
awaits
him
fruitful
within
we
heard
of
him
last
that
he
was
trying
the
german
waters
preparatory
to
his
undertaking
the
release
of
italy
from
the
subjugation
of
the
teuton
let
hope
they
wash
him
he
is
in
the
company
of
lady
judith
felle
your
old
friend
the
ardent
female
radical
who
married
the
decrepit
to
carry
out
her
principles
they
always
marry
english
lords
or
foreign
princes
i
admire
their
tactics
judith
is
bad
for
him
in
such
a
state
i
like
her
but
she
was
always
too
sentimental
said
austin
sentiment
made
her
marry
the
old
lord
i
suppose
i
like
her
for
her
sentiment
austin
sentimental
people
are
sure
to
live
long
and
die
fat
feeling
that
the
slayer
coz
sentiment
is
the
cajolery
of
existence
the
soft
bloom
which
whoso
weareth
he
or
she
is
enviable
would
that
i
had
more
you
not
much
changed
adrian
i
not
a
radical
austin
further
inquiries
responded
to
in
adrian
figurative
speech
instructed
austin
that
the
baronet
was
waiting
for
his
son
in
a
posture
of
statuesque
offended
paternity
before
he
would
receive
his
law
and
grandson
that
was
what
adrian
meant
by
the
efforts
of
the
system
to
swallow
the
baby
we
in
a
tangle
said
the
wise
youth
time
will
extricate
us
i
presume
or
what
is
the
venerable
signor
good
for
austin
mused
some
minutes
and
asked
for
lucy
place
of
residence
we
go
to
her
by
and
by
said
adrian
i
shall
go
and
see
her
now
said
austin
well
we
go
and
order
the
dinner
first
coz
give
me
her
address
really
austin
you
carry
matters
with
too
long
a
beard
adrian
objected
do
you
care
what
you
eat
he
roared
hoarsely
looking
humorously
hurt
i
daresay
not
a
slice
out
of
him
that
handy
sauce
du
ciel
go
batten
on
the
baby
cannibal
dinner
at
seven
adrian
gave
him
his
own
address
and
lucy
and
strolled
off
to
do
the
better
thing
overnight
berry
had
observed
a
long
stranger
in
her
posting
him
on
her
fingers
and
starting
him
with
a
smack
he
had
vaulted
lightly
and
thereby
indicated
that
he
was
positively
coming
the
next
day
she
forgot
him
in
the
bustle
of
her
duties
and
the
absorption
of
her
faculties
in
thoughts
of
the
incomparable
stranger
lucy
had
presented
to
the
world
till
a
knock
at
the
reminded
her
there
he
is
she
cried
as
she
ran
to
open
to
him
there
my
stranger
come
never
was
a
woman
faith
in
omens
so
justified
the
stranger
desired
to
see
richard
feverel
he
said
his
name
was
austin
wentworth
berry
clasped
her
hands
exclaiming
come
at
last
and
ran
bolt
out
of
the
house
to
look
up
and
down
the
street
presently
she
returned
with
many
excuses
for
her
rudeness
saying
i
expected
to
see
her
home
wentworth
every
day
twice
a
day
she
go
out
to
give
her
blessed
angel
an
airing
no
leavin
the
child
with
nursemaids
for
her
she
is
a
mother
and
good
milk
too
thank
the
lord
though
her
so
low
indoors
berry
stated
who
she
was
related
the
history
of
the
young
couple
and
her
participation
in
it
and
admired
the
beard
although
swear
you
do
wear
it
for
ornament
now
she
said
having
in
the
first
impulse
designed
a
stroke
at
man
vanity
ultimately
berry
spoke
of
the
family
complication
and
with
dejected
head
and
joined
hands
threw
out
dark
hints
about
richard
while
austin
was
giving
his
cheerfuller
views
of
the
case
lucy
came
in
preceding
the
baby
i
am
austin
wentworth
he
said
taking
her
hand
they
read
each
other
faces
these
two
and
smiled
kinship
your
name
is
lucy
she
affirmed
it
softly
and
mine
is
austin
as
you
know
berry
allowed
time
for
lucy
charms
to
subdue
him
and
presented
richard
representative
who
seeing
a
new
face
suffered
himself
to
be
contemplated
before
he
commenced
crying
aloud
and
knocking
at
the
doors
of
nature
for
something
that
was
due
to
him
ai
he
a
lusty
darlin
says
berry
ai
he
like
his
own
father
there
ca
be
no
doubt
about
zoo
zoo
pitty
pet
look
at
his
fists
ai
he
got
passion
ai
he
a
splendid
roarer
oh
and
she
went
off
rapturously
into
a
fine
boy
certainly
berry
exhibited
his
legs
for
further
proof
desiring
austin
confirmation
as
to
their
being
dumplings
lucy
murmured
a
word
of
excuse
and
bore
the
splendid
roarer
out
of
the
room
she
might
a
done
it
here
said
berry
there
no
prettier
sight
i
say
if
her
dear
husband
could
but
see
that
he
off
in
his
want
to
be
doin
all
sorts
o
things
i
say
he
never
do
anything
grander
than
that
baby
you
should
seen
her
uncle
over
that
baby
he
came
here
for
i
said
you
shall
see
your
own
family
my
dear
and
so
she
thinks
he
come
and
he
laughed
over
that
baby
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
poor
man
he
cried
he
did
you
should
see
that
thompson
wentworth
a
friend
o
richard
and
a
very
young
gentleman
he
worships
her
in
his
innocence
it
a
sight
to
see
him
with
that
baby
my
belief
is
he
unhappy
he
ca
anyways
be
to
him
o
wentworth
what
do
you
think
of
her
sir
austin
reply
was
as
satisfactory
as
a
man
poor
speech
could
make
it
he
heard
that
lady
feverel
was
in
the
house
and
berry
prepared
the
way
for
him
to
pay
his
respects
to
her
then
berry
ran
to
lucy
and
the
house
buzzed
with
new
life
the
simple
creatures
felt
in
presence
something
good
among
them
he
do
speak
much
said
berry
but
i
see
by
his
eye
he
mean
a
deal
he
ai
one
o
yer
word
gentry
who
all
gay
deceivers
every
one
of
lucy
pressed
the
hearty
suckling
into
her
breast
i
wonder
what
he
thinks
of
me
berry
i
could
not
speak
to
him
i
loved
him
before
i
saw
him
i
knew
what
his
face
was
like
he
looks
proper
even
with
a
beard
and
that
a
trial
for
a
virtuous
man
said
berry
one
sees
straight
through
the
hair
with
him
think
he
think
what
any
man
think
you
spite
o
all
your
sorrow
my
sweet
and
my
berry
talkin
of
his
roman
matrons
here
a
english
wife
match
all
that
what
he
thinks
and
now
that
leetle
dark
under
yer
eye
clear
my
darlin
now
he
come
berry
looked
to
no
more
than
that
lucy
to
no
more
than
the
peace
she
had
in
being
near
richard
best
friend
when
she
sat
down
to
tea
it
was
with
a
sense
that
the
little
room
that
held
her
was
her
home
perhaps
for
many
a
day
a
chop
procured
and
cooked
by
berry
formed
austin
dinner
during
the
meal
he
entertained
them
with
anecdotes
of
his
travels
poor
lucy
had
no
temptation
to
try
to
conquer
austin
that
heroic
weakness
of
hers
was
gone
berry
had
said
three
cups
i
goes
no
further
and
lucy
had
rejected
the
proffer
of
more
tea
when
austin
who
was
in
the
thick
of
a
brazilian
forest
asked
her
if
she
was
a
good
traveller
i
mean
can
you
start
at
a
minute
notice
lucy
hesitated
and
then
said
yes
decisively
to
which
berry
added
that
she
was
not
a
there
used
to
be
a
train
at
seven
austin
remarked
consulting
his
watch
the
two
women
were
silent
could
you
get
ready
to
come
with
me
to
raynham
in
ten
minutes
austin
looked
as
if
he
had
asked
a
commonplace
question
lucy
lips
parted
to
speak
she
could
not
answer
loud
rattled
the
teaboard
to
berry
dropping
hands
joy
and
deliverance
she
exclaimed
with
a
foundering
voice
will
you
come
austin
kindly
asked
again
lucy
tried
to
stop
her
beating
heart
as
she
answered
yes
berry
cunningly
pretended
to
interpret
the
irresolution
in
her
tones
with
a
mighty
whisper
she
thinking
what
to
be
done
with
baby
he
must
learn
to
travel
said
austin
oh
cried
berry
and
i
be
his
nuss
and
bear
him
a
sweet
oh
and
think
of
it
me
once
more
at
raynham
abbey
but
now
you
must
say
let
us
be
goin
on
the
spot
she
started
up
and
away
in
hot
haste
fearing
delay
would
cool
the
resolve
austin
smiled
eying
his
watch
and
lucy
alternately
she
was
wishing
to
ask
a
multitude
of
questions
his
face
reassured
her
and
saying
i
will
be
dressed
instantly
she
also
left
the
room
talking
bustling
preparing
wrapping
up
my
lord
and
looking
to
their
neatnesses
they
were
nevertheless
ready
within
the
time
prescribed
by
austin
and
berry
stood
humming
over
the
baby
sleep
it
through
she
said
he
had
enough
for
an
alderman
and
goes
to
sleep
sound
after
his
dinner
he
do
a
duck
before
they
departed
lucy
ran
up
to
lady
feverel
she
returned
for
the
small
one
one
moment
mr
wentworth
just
two
said
austin
master
richard
was
taken
up
and
when
lucy
came
back
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
she
thinks
she
is
never
to
see
him
again
mr
wentworth
she
shall
austin
said
simply
off
they
went
and
with
austin
near
her
lucy
forgot
to
dwell
at
all
upon
the
great
act
of
courage
she
was
performing
i
do
hope
baby
will
not
wake
was
her
chief
solicitude
he
cries
berry
from
the
rear
his
little
as
tight
as
he
can
hold
a
pet
a
lamb
a
bird
a
beauty
and
ye
may
take
yer
oath
he
never
wakes
till
that
slack
he
got
character
of
his
own
a
blessed
there
are
some
tremendous
citadels
that
only
want
to
be
taken
by
storm
the
baronet
sat
alone
in
his
library
sick
of
resistance
and
rejoicing
in
the
pride
of
no
surrender
a
terror
to
his
friends
and
to
himself
hearing
austin
name
sonorously
pronounced
by
the
man
of
calves
he
looked
up
from
his
book
and
held
out
his
hand
glad
to
see
you
austin
his
appearance
betokened
complete
security
the
next
minute
he
found
himself
escaladed
it
was
a
cry
from
berry
that
told
him
others
were
in
the
room
besides
austin
lucy
stood
a
little
behind
the
lamp
berry
close
to
the
door
the
door
was
half
open
and
passing
through
it
might
be
seen
the
petrified
figure
of
a
fine
man
the
baronet
glancing
over
the
lamp
rose
at
berry
signification
of
a
woman
personality
austin
stepped
back
and
led
lucy
to
him
by
the
hand
i
have
brought
wife
sir
he
said
with
a
pleased
perfectly
uncalculating
countenance
that
was
disarming
very
pale
and
trembling
lucy
bowed
she
felt
her
two
hands
taken
and
heard
a
kind
voice
could
it
be
possible
it
belonged
to
the
dreadful
father
of
her
husband
she
lifted
her
eyes
nervously
her
hands
were
still
detained
the
baronet
contemplated
richard
choice
had
he
ever
had
a
rivalry
with
those
pure
eyes
he
saw
the
pain
of
her
position
shooting
across
her
brows
and
gentle
inquiries
as
to
her
health
placed
her
in
a
seat
berry
had
already
fallen
into
a
chair
what
aspect
do
you
like
for
your
bedroom
east
said
the
baronet
lucy
was
asking
herself
wonderingly
am
i
to
stay
perhaps
you
had
better
take
to
richard
room
at
once
he
pursued
you
have
the
lobourne
valley
there
and
a
good
morning
air
and
will
feel
more
at
home
lucy
colour
mounted
berry
gave
a
short
cough
as
one
who
should
say
the
day
is
ours
undoubtedly
strange
as
it
was
to
think
it
the
fortress
was
carried
lucy
is
rather
tired
said
austin
and
to
hear
her
christian
name
thus
bravely
spoken
brought
grateful
dew
to
her
eyes
the
baronet
was
about
to
touch
the
bell
but
have
you
come
alone
he
asked
at
this
berry
came
forward
not
immediately
it
seemed
to
require
effort
for
her
to
move
and
when
she
was
within
the
region
of
the
lamp
her
agitation
could
not
escape
notice
the
blissful
bundle
shook
in
her
arms
by
the
way
what
is
he
to
me
austin
inquired
generally
as
he
went
and
unveiled
the
younger
hope
of
raynham
my
relationship
is
not
so
defined
as
yours
sir
an
observer
might
have
supposed
that
the
baronet
peeped
at
his
grandson
with
the
courteous
indifference
of
one
who
merely
wished
to
compliment
the
mother
of
anybody
child
i
really
think
he
like
richard
austin
laughed
lucy
looked
i
am
sure
he
is
as
like
as
one
to
one
berry
murmured
feebly
but
grandpapa
not
speaking
she
thought
it
incumbent
on
her
to
pluck
up
and
he
as
healthy
as
his
father
was
sir
austin
spite
o
the
might
beens
as
the
clock
we
never
want
a
clock
since
he
come
we
knows
the
hour
o
the
day
and
of
the
night
you
nurse
him
yourself
of
course
the
baronet
spoke
to
lucy
and
was
satisfied
on
that
point
berry
was
going
to
display
his
prodigious
legs
lucy
fearing
the
consequent
effect
on
the
prodigious
lungs
begged
her
not
to
wake
him
take
a
deal
to
do
that
said
berry
and
harped
on
master
richard
health
and
the
small
wonder
it
was
that
he
enjoyed
it
considering
the
superior
quality
of
his
diet
and
the
lavish
attentions
of
his
mother
and
then
suddenly
fell
silent
on
a
deep
sigh
he
looks
healthy
said
the
baronet
but
i
am
not
a
judge
of
babies
thus
having
capitulated
raynham
chose
to
acknowledge
its
new
commandant
who
was
now
borne
away
under
the
directions
of
the
housekeeper
to
occupy
the
room
richard
had
slept
in
when
an
infant
austin
cast
no
thought
on
his
success
the
baronet
said
she
is
extremely
he
replied
a
person
you
take
to
at
once
there
it
ended
but
a
much
more
animated
colloquy
was
taking
place
aloft
where
lucy
and
berry
sat
alone
lucy
expected
her
to
talk
about
the
reception
they
had
met
with
and
the
house
and
the
peculiarities
of
the
rooms
and
the
solid
happiness
that
seemed
in
store
berry
all
the
while
would
persist
in
consulting
the
her
first
distinct
answer
was
my
dear
tell
me
candid
how
do
i
look
very
nice
indeed
berry
but
could
you
have
believed
he
would
be
so
kind
so
considerate
i
am
sure
i
looked
a
frump
returned
berry
oh

two
birds
at
a
shot
what
do
you
think
now
i
never
saw
so
wonderful
a
likeness

lucy

at
me
berry
was
trembling
and
hot
in
the
palms
you
very
feverish
dear
berry
what
can
it
be
ai
it
like
the
of
a
young
gal

dear

to
bed

says
lucy
pouting
in
her
soft
caressing
way
i
will
undress
you
and
see
to
you
dear
heart
you
had
so
much
excitement
ha
ha
berry
laughed
hysterically
she
thinks
it
about
this
business
of
hers
why

my
darlin
but
i
did
look
for
tragedy
sleep
in
this
house

was
astonished

here
mrs
berry
oh

berry
with

sceptical
nose

shoes
and
bellows
when
you

a
pin
into
their
calves
i
seen
my
berry
your
husband
large
as
life
lucy
meditated
on
optical
delusions
but
berry
described
him
as
the
colossus
who
had
marched
them
into
the
library
and
vowed
that
he
had
recognized
her
and
quaked
time
ai
aged
him
said
berry
whereas
me
he
got
his
excuse
now
i
know

a
frump
lucy
kissed
her

look
the
nicest
dearest
old
thing

may
say
an
old
thing
my
dear
and
your
husband

really

berry
below
profoundly
uttered
as
this
was
it
chased
every
vestige
of
incredulity
what
will

mrs
berry
go
my
dear
leave
him
to
be
happy
in
his
own
way
it
over
atween

i
felt
there

good
creature
that

man
when
we

berry
ejaculated
lucy

left
the
room
on
the
landing
outside
the
door
lucy
met
a
lady
dressed
in
black
who
stopped
her
and
asked
if
she
was
richard
wife
and
kissed
her
passing
from
her
immediately
lucy
despatched
a
message
for
austin
and
related
the
berry
history
austin
sent
for
the
great
man
and
said
do
you
know
your
wife
is
here
before
berry
had
time
to
draw
himself
up
to
enunciate
his
longest
he
was
requested
to
step
upstairs
and
as
his
young
mistress
at
once
led
the
way
berry
could
not
refuse
to
put
his
legs
in
motion
and
carry
the
stately
edifice
aloft
of
the
interview
berry
gave
lucy
a
slight
sketch
that
night
he
began
in
the
old
way
my
dear
and
says
i
a
true
heart
and
plain
words
martin
berry
so
there
he
cuts
himself
and
his
johnson
short
and
down
he
goes
down
on
his
knees
i
never
could
believed
it
i
kep
my
dignity
as

till
i
see
that
sight
but
that
done
for
me
i
was
a
ripe
apple
in
his
arms
i
knew
where
i
was
there
something
about
a
fine
man
on
his
knees
that
too
much
for
us
women
and
it
reely
was
the
penitent
on
his
two
knees
not
the
lover
on
his
one
if
he
mean
it
but
ah
what
do
you
think
he
begs
of
me
my
dear
not
to
make
it
known
in
the
house
just
yet
i
ca
i
ca
say
that
look
well
lucy
attributed
it
to
his
sense
of
shame
at
his
conduct
and
berry
did
her
best
to
look
on
it
in
that
light
did
the
kiss
ye
when
you
wished
him
goodnight
she
asked
lucy
said
he
had
not
then
bide
awake
as
long
as
ye
can
was
rejoinder
and
now
let
us
pray
blessings
on
that
gentleman
who
does
so
much
he
says
so
little
like
many
other
natural
people
berry
was
only
silly
where
her
own
soft
heart
was
concerned
as
she
secretly
anticipated
the
baronet
came
into
her
room
when
all
was
quiet
she
saw
him
go
and
bend
over
richard
the
second
and
remain
earnestly
watching
him
he
then
went
to
the
opened
door
of
the
room
where
lucy
slept
leaned
his
ear
a
moment
knocked
gently
and
entered
berry
heard
low
words
interchanging
within
she
could
not
catch
a
syllable
yet
she
would
have
sworn
to
the
context
he
called
her
his
daughter
promised
her
happiness
and
given
a
father
kiss
to
her
when
sir
austin
passed
out
she
was
in
a
deep
sleep
chapter
xlii
briareus
reddening
angrily
over
the
sea
what
is
that
vaporous
titan
and
hesper
set
in
his
rosy
garland
why
looks
he
so
implacably
sweet
it
is
that
one
has
left
that
bright
home
to
go
forth
and
do
cloudy
work
and
he
has
got
a
stain
with
which
he
dare
not
return
far
in
the
west
fair
lucy
beckons
him
to
come
ah
heaven
if
he
might
how
strong
and
fierce
the
temptation
is
how
subtle
the
sleepless
desire
it
drugs
his
reason
his
honour
for
he
loves
her
she
is
still
the
first
and
only
woman
to
him
otherwise
would
this
black
spot
be
hell
to
him
otherwise
would
his
limbs
be
chained
while
her
arms
are
spread
open
to
him
and
if
he
loves
her
why
then
what
is
one
fall
in
the
pit
or
a
thousand
is
not
love
the
password
to
that
beckoning
bliss
so
may
we
say
but
here
is
one
whose
body
has
been
made
a
temple
to
him
and
it
is
desecrated
a
temple
and
desecrated
for
what
is
it
fit
for
but
for
a
dance
of
devils
his
education
has
thus
wrought
him
to
think
he
can
blame
nothing
but
his
own
baseness
but
to
feel
base
and
accept
the
bliss
that
beckons
he
has
not
fallen
so
low
as
that
ah
happy
english
home
sweet
wife
what
mad
miserable
wisp
of
the
fancy
led
him
away
from
you
high
in
his
conceit
poor
wretch
that
thought
to
be
he
of
the
hundred
hands
and
war
against
the
absolute
gods
jove
whispered
a
light
commission
to
the
laughing
dame
she
met
him
and
how
did
he
shake
olympus
with
laughter
sure
it
were
better
to
be
orestes
the
furies
howling
in
his
ears
than
one
called
to
by
a
heavenly
soul
from
whom
he
is
for
ever
outcast
he
has
not
the
oblivion
of
madness
clothed
in
the
lights
of
his
first
passion
robed
in
the
splendour
of
old
skies
she
meets
him
everywhere
morning
evening
night
she
shines
above
him
waylays
him
suddenly
in
forest
depths
drops
palpably
on
his
heart
at
moments
he
forgets
he
rushes
to
embrace
her
calls
her
his
beloved
and
lo
her
innocent
kiss
brings
agony
of
shame
to
his
face
daily
the
struggle
endured
his
father
wrote
to
him
begging
him
by
the
love
he
had
for
him
to
return
from
that
hour
richard
burnt
unread
all
the
letters
he
received
he
knew
too
well
how
easily
he
could
persuade
himself
words
from
without
might
tempt
him
and
quite
extinguish
the
spark
of
honourable
feeling
that
tortured
him
and
that
he
clung
to
in
desperate
to
arrest
young
gentlemen
on
the
downward
slope
is
both
a
dangerous
and
thankless
office
it
is
nevertheless
one
that
fair
women
greatly
prize
and
certain
of
them
professionally
follow
lady
judith
as
far
as
her
sex
would
permit
was
also
of
the
titans
in
their
battle
against
the
absolute
gods
for
which
purpose
mark
you
she
had
married
a
lord
incapable
in
all
save
his
acres
her
achievements
she
kept
to
her
own
mind
she
did
not
look
happy
over
them
she
met
richard
accidentally
in
paris
she
saw
his
state
she
let
him
learn
that
she
alone
on
earth
understood
him
the
consequence
was
that
he
was
forthwith
enrolled
in
her
train
it
soothed
him
to
be
near
a
woman
did
she
venture
her
guess
as
to
the
cause
of
his
conduct
she
blotted
it
out
with
a
facility
women
have
and
cast
on
it
a
melancholy
hue
he
was
taught
to
participate
in
she
spoke
of
sorrows
personal
sorrows
much
as
he
might
speak
of
his
vaguely
and
with
and
she
understood
him
how
the
dark
unfathomed
wealth
within
us
gleams
to
a
woman
eye
we
are
at
compound
interest
immediately
so
much
richer
than
we
knew
almost
as
rich
as
we
dreamed
but
then
the
instant
we
are
away
from
her
we
find
ourselves
bankrupt
beggared
how
is
that
we
do
not
ask
we
hurry
to
her
and
bask
hungrily
in
her
orbs
the
eye
must
be
feminine
to
be
thus
creative
i
can
not
say
why
lady
judith
understood
richard
and
he
feeling
infinitely
vile
somehow
held
to
her
more
feverishly
as
one
who
dreaded
the
worst
in
missing
her
the
spirit
must
rest
he
was
weak
with
what
he
suffered
austin
found
them
among
the
hills
of
nassau
in
rhineland
titans
male
and
female
who
had
not
displaced
jove
and
were
now
adrift
prone
on
floods
of
sentiment
the
peasant
swinging
behind
his
oxen
of
a
morning
the
the
even
the
doctor
of
those
regions
have
done
more
for
their
fellows
horrible
reflection
lady
judith
is
serene
above
it
but
it
frets
at
richard
when
he
is
out
of
her
shadow
often
wretchedly
he
watches
the
young
men
of
his
own
age
trooping
to
their
work
not
theirs
work
solid
unambitious
fruitful
lady
judith
had
a
nobler
in
prospect
for
the
hero
he
gaped
blindfolded
for
anything
and
she
gave
him
the
map
of
europe
in
tatters
he
swallowed
it
comfortably
it
was
an
intoxicating
cordial
himself
on
horseback
overriding
wrecks
of
empires
well
might
common
sense
cower
with
the
meaner
animals
at
the
picture
tacitly
they
agreed
to
recast
the
civilized
globe
the
quality
of
vapour
is
to
melt
and
shape
itself
anew
but
it
is
never
the
quality
of
vapour
to
reassume
the
same
shapes
briareus
of
the
hundred
unoccupied
hands
may
turn
to
a
monstrous
donkey
with
his
hind
legs
aloft
or
twenty
thousand
jabbering
apes
the
phantasmic
groupings
of
the
young
brain
are
very
like
those
we
see
in
the
skies
and
equally
the
sport
of
the
wind
lady
judith
blew
there
was
plenty
of
vapour
in
him
and
it
always
resolved
into
some
shape
or
other
you
that
mark
those
clouds
of
eventide
and
know
youth
will
see
the
similitude
it
will
not
be
strange
it
will
barely
seem
foolish
to
you
that
a
young
man
of
richard
age
richard
education
and
position
should
be
in
this
wild
state
had
he
not
been
nursed
to
believe
he
was
born
for
great
things
did
she
not
say
she
was
sure
of
it
and
to
feel
base
yet
born
for
better
is
enough
to
make
one
grasp
at
anything
cloudy
suppose
the
hero
with
a
game
leg
how
intense
is
his
faith
to
quacks
with
what
a
passion
of
longing
is
he
not
seized
to
break
somebody
head
they
spoke
of
italy
in
low
voices
the
time
will
come
said
she
and
i
shall
be
ready
said
he
what
rank
was
he
to
take
in
the
liberating
army
captain
colonel
general
in
chief
or
simple
private
here
as
became
him
he
was
much
more
positive
and
specific
than
she
was
simple
private
he
said
yet
he
save
himself
caracoling
on
horseback
private
in
the
cavalry
then
of
course
private
in
the
cavalry
wrecks
of
empires
she
looked
forth
under
her
brows
with
mournful
indistinctness
at
that
object
in
the
distance
they
read
petrarch
to
get
up
the
necessary
fires
italia
mia
vain
indeed
was
this
speaking
to
those
thick
and
mortal
wounds
in
her
fair
body
but
their
sighs
went
with
the
tiber
the
arno
and
the
po
and
their
hands
joined
who
has
not
wept
for
italy
i
see
the
aspirations
of
a
world
arise
for
her
thick
and
frequent
as
the
puffs
of
smoke
from
cigars
of
pannonian
sentries
so
when
austin
came
richard
said
he
could
not
leave
lady
judith
lady
judith
said
she
could
not
part
with
him
for
his
sake
mind
this
richard
verified
perhaps
he
had
reason
to
be
grateful
the
high
road
of
folly
may
have
led
him
from
one
that
terminates
worse
ho
is
foolish
god
knows
but
for
my
part
i
will
not
laugh
at
the
hero
because
he
has
not
got
his
occasion
meet
him
when
he
is
as
it
were
anointed
by
his
occasion
and
he
is
no
laughing
matter
richard
felt
his
safety
in
this
which
to
please
the
world
we
must
term
folly
exhalation
of
vapours
was
a
wholesome
process
to
him
and
somebody
who
gave
them
shape
and
hue
a
beneficent
iris
he
told
austin
plainly
he
could
not
leave
her
and
did
not
anticipate
the
day
when
he
could
why
ca
you
go
to
your
wife
richard
for
a
reason
you
would
be
the
first
to
approve
austin
he
welcomed
austin
with
every
show
of
manly
tenderness
and
sadness
at
heart
austin
he
had
always
associated
with
his
lucy
in
that
hesperian
palace
of
the
west
austin
waited
patiently
lady
judith
old
lord
played
on
all
the
baths
in
nassau
without
evoking
the
tune
of
health
whithersoever
he
listed
she
changed
her
abode
so
admirable
a
wife
was
to
be
pardoned
for
espousing
an
old
man
she
was
an
enthusiast
even
in
her
connubial
duties
she
had
the
brows
of
an
enthusiast
with
occasion
she
might
have
been
a
charlotte
corday
so
let
her
also
be
shielded
from
the
ban
of
ridicule
nonsense
of
enthusiasts
is
very
different
from
nonsense
of
ninnies
she
was
truly
a
person
of
that
order
who
always
do
what
they
see
to
be
right
and
always
have
confidence
in
their
optics
she
was
not
unworthy
of
a
young
man
admiration
if
she
was
unfit
to
be
his
guide
she
resumed
her
ancient
intimacy
with
austin
easily
while
she
preserved
her
new
footing
with
richard
she
and
austin
were
not
unlike
only
austin
never
dreamed
and
had
not
married
an
old
lord
the
three
were
walking
on
the
bridge
at
limburg
on
the
lahn
where
the
shadow
of
a
stone
bishop
is
thrown
by
the
moonlight
on
the
water
brawling
over
slabs
of
slate
a
woman
passed
them
bearing
in
her
arms
a
baby
whose
mighty
size
drew
their
attention
what
a
wopper
richard
laughed
well
that
is
a
fine
fellow
said
austin
but
i
do
think
he
much
bigger
than
your
boy
he
do
for
a
arminius
richard
was
saying
then
he
looked
at
austin
what
was
that
you
said
lady
judith
asked
of
austin
what
have
i
said
that
deserves
to
be
repeated
austin
counterqueried
quite
innocently
richard
has
a
son
you
did
know
it
his
modesty
goes
very
far
said
lady
judith
sweeping
the
shadow
of
a
curtsey
to
richard
paternity
richard
heart
throbbed
with
violence
he
looked
again
in
face
austin
took
it
so
much
as
a
matter
of
course
that
he
said
nothing
more
on
the
subject
well
murmured
lady
judith
when
the
two
men
were
alone
richard
said
in
a
quick
voice
austin
you
were
in
earnest
you
did
know
it
richard
no
why
they
all
wrote
to
you
lucy
wrote
to
you
your
father
your
aunt
i
believe
adrian
wrote
too
i
tore
up
their
letters
said
richard
he
a
noble
fellow
i
can
tell
you
you
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
he
soon
be
coming
to
ask
about
you
i
made
sure
you
knew
no
i
never
knew
richard
walked
away
and
then
said
what
is
he
like
well
he
really
is
like
you
but
he
has
his
mother
eyes
and
she
yes
i
think
the
child
has
kept
her
well
they
both
at
raynham
both
hence
fantastic
vapours
what
are
ye
to
this
where
are
the
dreams
of
the
hero
when
he
learns
he
has
a
child
nature
is
taking
him
to
her
bosom
she
will
speak
presently
every
domesticated
boor
in
these
hills
can
boast
the
same
yet
marvels
the
hero
at
none
of
his
visioned
prodigies
as
he
does
when
he
comes
to
hear
of
this
most
common
performance
a
father
richard
fixed
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
trying
to
make
out
the
lineaments
of
his
child
telling
austin
he
would
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
he
sallied
into
the
air
and
walked
on
and
on
a
father
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
a
child
and
though
he
knew
it
not
he
was
striking
the
keynotes
of
nature
but
he
did
know
of
a
singular
harmony
that
suddenly
burst
over
his
whole
being
the
moon
was
surpassingly
bright
the
summer
air
heavy
and
still
he
left
the
high
road
and
pierced
into
the
forest
his
walk
was
rapid
the
leaves
on
the
trees
brushed
his
cheeks
the
dead
leaves
heaped
in
the
dells
noised
to
his
feet
something
of
a
religious
joy
a
strange
sacred
pleasure
was
in
him
by
degrees
it
wore
he
remembered
himself
and
now
he
was
possessed
by
a
proportionate
anguish
a
father
he
dared
never
see
his
child
and
he
had
no
longer
his
phantasies
to
fall
upon
he
was
utterly
bare
to
his
sin
in
his
troubled
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
clare
looked
down
on
him
clare
who
saw
him
as
he
was
and
that
to
her
eyes
it
would
be
infamy
for
him
to
go
and
print
his
kiss
upon
his
child
then
came
stern
efforts
to
command
his
misery
and
make
the
nerves
of
his
face
iron
by
the
log
of
an
ancient
tree
half
buried
in
dead
leaves
of
past
summers
beside
a
brook
he
halted
as
one
who
had
reached
his
journey
end
there
he
discovered
he
had
a
companion
in
lady
judith
little
dog
he
gave
the
friendly
animal
a
pat
of
recognition
and
both
were
silent
in
the
it
was
impossible
for
richard
to
return
his
heart
was
surcharged
he
must
advance
and
on
he
footed
the
little
dog
following
an
oppressive
slumber
hung
about
the
in
the
dells
and
on
the
heights
was
the
same
dead
heat
here
where
the
brook
tinkled
it
was
no
sound
but
metallic
and
without
the
spirit
of
water
yonder
in
a
space
of
moonlight
on
lush
grass
the
beams
were
as
white
fire
to
sight
and
feeling
no
haze
spread
around
the
valleys
were
clear
defined
to
the
shadows
of
their
verges
the
distances
sharply
distinct
and
with
the
colours
of
day
but
slightly
softened
richard
beheld
a
roe
moving
across
a
slope
of
sward
far
out
of
the
breathless
silence
was
significant
yet
the
moon
shone
in
a
broad
blue
heaven
tongue
out
of
mouth
trotted
the
little
dog
after
him
crouched
panting
when
he
stopped
an
instant
rose
weariedly
when
he
started
afresh
now
and
then
a
large
white
flitted
through
the
dusk
of
the
forest
on
a
barren
corner
of
the
wooded
highland
looking
inland
stood
grey
topless
ruins
set
in
nettles
and
rank
richard
mechanically
sat
down
on
the
crumbling
flints
to
rest
and
listened
to
the
panting
of
the
dog
sprinkled
at
his
feet
were
emerald
lights
hundreds
of
worms
studded
the
dark
dry
ground
he
sat
and
eyed
them
thinking
not
at
all
his
energies
were
expended
in
action
he
sat
as
a
part
of
the
ruins
and
the
moon
turned
his
shadow
westward
from
the
south
overhead
as
she
declined
long
ripples
of
silver
cloud
were
imperceptibly
stealing
toward
her
they
were
the
van
of
a
tempest
he
did
not
observe
them
or
the
leaves
beginning
to
chatter
when
he
again
pursued
his
course
with
his
face
to
the
rhine
a
huge
mountain
appeared
to
rise
sheer
over
him
and
he
had
it
in
his
mind
to
scale
it
he
got
no
nearer
to
the
base
of
it
for
all
his
vigorous
outstepping
the
ground
began
to
dip
he
lost
sight
of
the
sky
then
heavy
streak
his
cheek
the
leaves
were
singing
the
earth
breathed
it
was
black
before
him
and
behind
all
at
once
the
thunder
spoke
the
mountain
he
had
marked
was
bursting
over
him
up
startled
the
whole
forest
in
violet
fire
he
saw
the
country
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
to
the
bounding
rhine
gleam
quiver
extinguished
then
there
were
pauses
and
the
lightning
seemed
as
the
eye
of
heaven
and
the
thunder
as
the
tongue
of
heaven
each
alternately
addressing
him
filling
him
with
awful
rapture
alone
there
sole
human
creature
among
the
grandeurs
and
mysteries
of
storm
he
felt
the
representative
of
his
kind
and
his
spirit
rose
and
marched
and
exulted
let
it
be
glory
let
it
be
ruin
lower
down
the
lightened
abysses
of
air
rolled
the
wrathful
crash
then
white
thrusts
of
light
were
darted
from
the
sky
and
great
curving
ferns
seen
steadfast
in
pallor
a
second
were
supernaturally
agitated
and
vanished
then
a
shrill
song
roused
in
the
leaves
and
the
herbage
prolonged
and
louder
it
sounded
as
deeper
and
heavier
the
deluge
pressed
a
mighty
force
of
water
satisfied
the
desire
of
the
earth
even
in
this
drenched
as
he
was
by
the
first
outpouring
richard
had
a
savage
pleasure
keeping
in
motion
he
was
scarcely
conscious
of
the
wet
and
the
grateful
breath
of
the
weeds
was
refreshing
suddenly
he
stopped
short
lifting
a
curious
nostril
he
fancied
he
smelt
sweet
he
had
never
seen
the
flower
in
rhineland
never
thought
of
it
and
it
would
hardly
be
met
with
in
a
forest
he
was
sure
he
smelt
it
fresh
in
dews
his
little
companion
wagged
a
miserable
wet
tail
some
way
in
advance
he
went
an
slowly
thinking
indistinctly
after
two
or
three
steps
he
stooped
and
stretched
out
his
hand
to
feel
for
the
flower
having
he
knew
not
why
a
strong
wish
to
verify
its
growth
there
groping
about
his
hand
encountered
something
warm
that
started
at
his
touch
and
he
with
the
instinct
we
have
seized
it
and
lifted
it
to
look
at
it
the
creature
was
very
small
evidently
quite
young
richard
eyes
now
accustomed
to
the
darkness
were
able
to
discern
it
for
what
it
was
a
tiny
leveret
and
ha
supposed
that
the
dog
had
probably
frightened
its
dam
just
before
he
found
it
he
put
the
little
thing
on
one
hand
in
his
breast
and
stepped
out
rapidly
as
before
the
rain
was
now
steady
from
every
tree
a
fountain
poured
so
cool
and
easy
had
his
mind
become
that
he
was
speculating
on
what
kind
of
shelter
the
birds
could
find
and
how
the
butterflies
and
moths
saved
their
coloured
wings
from
washing
folded
close
they
might
hang
under
a
leaf
he
thought
lovingly
he
looked
into
the
dripping
darkness
of
the
coverts
on
each
side
as
one
of
their
children
he
was
next
musing
on
a
strange
sensation
he
experienced
it
ran
up
one
arm
with
an
indescribable
thrill
but
communicated
nothing
to
his
heart
it
was
purely
physical
ceased
for
a
time
and
recommenced
till
he
had
it
all
through
his
blood
wonderfully
thrilling
he
grew
aware
that
the
little
thing
he
carried
in
his
breast
was
licking
his
hand
there
the
small
rough
tongue
going
over
and
over
the
palm
of
his
hand
produced
the
strange
sensation
he
felt
now
that
he
knew
the
cause
the
marvel
ended
but
now
that
he
knew
the
cause
his
heart
was
touched
and
made
more
of
it
the
gentle
scraping
continued
without
intermission
as
on
he
walked
what
did
it
say
to
him
human
tongue
could
not
have
said
so
much
just
then
a
pale
grey
light
on
the
skirts
of
the
flying
tempest
displayed
the
dawn
richard
was
walking
hurriedly
the
green
drenched
weeds
lay
all
about
in
his
path
bent
thick
and
the
forest
drooped
glimmeringly
impelled
as
a
man
who
feels
a
revelation
mounting
obscurely
to
his
brain
richard
was
passing
one
of
those
little
hung
with
votive
wreaths
where
the
peasant
halts
to
kneel
and
pray
cold
still
in
the
twilight
it
stood
pattering
round
it
he
looked
within
and
saw
the
virgin
holding
her
child
he
moved
by
but
not
many
steps
had
he
gone
ere
his
strength
went
out
of
him
and
he
shuddered
what
was
it
he
asked
not
he
was
in
other
hands
vivid
as
lightning
the
spirit
of
life
illumined
him
he
felt
in
his
heart
the
cry
of
his
child
his
touch
with
shut
eyes
he
saw
them
both
they
drew
him
from
the
depths
they
led
him
a
blind
and
tottering
man
and
as
they
led
him
he
had
a
sense
of
purification
so
sweet
he
shuddered
again
and
again
when
he
looked
out
from
his
trance
on
the
breathing
world
the
small
birds
hopped
and
chirped
warm
fresh
sunlight
was
over
all
the
hills
he
was
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
entering
a
plain
clothed
with
ripe
corn
under
a
spacious
morning
sky
chapter
xliii
they
heard
at
raynham
that
richard
was
coming
lucy
had
the
news
first
in
a
letter
from
ripton
thompson
who
met
him
at
bonn
ripton
did
not
say
that
he
had
employed
his
vacation
holiday
on
purpose
to
use
his
efforts
to
induce
his
dear
friend
to
return
to
his
wife
and
finding
richard
already
on
his
way
of
course
ripton
said
nothing
to
him
but
affected
to
be
travelling
for
his
pleasure
like
any
cockney
richard
also
wrote
to
her
in
case
she
should
have
gone
to
the
sea
he
directed
her
to
send
word
to
his
hotel
that
he
might
not
lose
an
hour
his
letter
was
sedate
in
tone
very
sweet
to
her
assisted
by
the
faithful
female
berry
she
was
conquering
an
aphorist
woman
reason
is
in
the
milk
of
her
breasts
was
one
of
his
rough
notes
due
to
an
observation
of
lucy
maternal
cares
let
us
remember
therefore
we
men
who
have
drunk
of
it
largely
there
that
she
has
it
berry
zealously
apprised
him
how
early
master
richard
education
had
commenced
and
the
great
future
historian
he
must
consequently
be
this
trait
in
lucy
was
of
itself
sufficient
to
win
sir
austin
here
my
plan
with
richard
was
false
he
reflected
in
presuming
that
anything
save
blind
fortuity
would
bring
him
such
a
mate
as
he
should
have
he
came
to
add
and
has
got
he
could
admit
now
that
instinct
had
so
far
beaten
science
for
as
richard
was
coming
as
all
were
to
be
happy
his
wisdom
embraced
them
all
paternally
as
the
author
of
their
happiness
between
him
and
lucy
a
tender
intimacy
grew
i
told
you
she
could
talk
sir
said
adrian
she
thinks
said
the
baronet
the
delicate
question
how
she
was
to
treat
her
uncle
he
settled
generously
farmer
blaize
should
come
up
to
raynham
when
he
would
lucy
must
visit
him
at
least
three
times
a
week
he
had
farmer
blaize
and
berry
to
study
and
really
excellent
aphorisms
sprang
from
the
plain
human
bases
this
natural
couple
presented
it
will
do
us
no
harm
he
thought
some
of
the
honest
blood
of
the
soil
in
our
veins
and
he
was
content
in
musing
on
the
parentage
of
the
little
cradled
boy
a
common
sight
for
those
who
had
the
entry
to
the
library
was
the
baronet
cherishing
the
hand
of
his
so
richard
was
crossing
the
sea
and
hearts
at
raynham
were
beating
quicker
measures
as
the
minutes
progressed
that
night
he
would
be
with
them
sir
austin
gave
lucy
a
longer
warmer
salute
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
berry
waxed
thrice
amorous
it
your
second
bridals
ye
sweet
livin
widow
she
said
thanks
be
the
lord
it
the
same
man
too
and
a
baby
over
the
she
appended
seriously
strange
berry
declared
it
to
be
strange
i
feel
none
o
this
to
my
berry
now
all
my
feelin
o
love
seem
gone
into
you
two
sweet
chicks
in
fact
the
faithless
male
berry
complained
of
being
treated
badly
and
affected
a
superb
jealousy
of
the
baby
but
the
good
dame
told
him
that
if
he
suffered
at
all
he
suffered
his
due
berry
position
was
decidedly
uncomfortable
it
could
not
be
concealed
from
the
lower
household
that
he
had
a
wife
in
the
establishment
and
for
the
complications
this
gave
rise
to
his
wife
would
not
legitimately
console
him
lucy
did
intercede
but
berry
was
obdurate
she
averred
she
would
not
give
up
the
child
till
he
was
weaned
then
perhaps
she
said
prospectively
you
see
i
ai
so
soft
as
you
thought
for
you
a
very
unkind
vindictive
old
woman
said
lucy
belike
i
am
berry
was
proud
to
agree
we
like
a
new
character
now
and
then
berry
had
delayed
too
long
were
it
not
notorious
that
the
straightlaced
prudish
dare
not
listen
to
the
natural
chaste
certain
things
berry
thought
it
advisable
to
impart
to
the
young
wife
with
regard
to
berry
infidelity
and
the
charity
women
should
have
toward
sinful
men
might
here
be
reproduced
enough
that
she
thought
proper
to
broach
the
matter
and
cite
her
own
christian
sentiments
now
that
she
was
indifferent
in
some
degree
oily
calm
is
on
the
sea
at
raynham
they
look
up
at
the
sky
and
speculate
that
richard
is
approaching
fairly
speeded
he
comes
to
throw
himself
on
his
darling
mercy
lucy
irradiated
over
forest
and
sea
tempest
and
peace
to
her
the
hero
comes
humbly
great
is
that
day
when
we
see
our
folly
ripton
and
he
were
the
friends
of
old
richard
encouraged
him
to
talk
of
the
two
he
could
be
eloquent
on
and
ripton
whose
secret
vanity
was
in
his
powers
of
speech
never
tired
of
enumerating
lucy
virtues
and
the
peculiar
attributes
of
the
baby
she
did
not
say
a
word
against
me
rip
against
you
richard
the
moment
she
knew
she
was
to
be
a
mother
she
thought
of
nothing
but
her
duty
to
the
child
she
one
who
ca
think
of
herself
you
seen
her
at
raynham
rip
yes
once
they
asked
me
down
and
your
father
so
fond
of
her
sure
he
thinks
no
woman
like
her
and
he
right
she
is
so
lovely
and
so
good
richard
was
too
full
of
blame
of
himself
to
blame
his
father
too
british
to
expose
his
emotions
ripton
divined
how
deep
and
changed
they
were
by
his
manner
he
had
cast
aside
the
hero
and
however
ripton
had
obeyed
him
and
looked
up
to
him
in
the
heroic
time
he
loved
him
tenfold
now
he
told
his
friend
how
much
lucy
mere
womanly
sweetness
and
excellence
had
done
for
him
and
richard
contrasted
his
own
profitless
extravagance
with
the
patient
beauty
of
his
dear
home
angel
he
was
not
one
to
take
her
on
the
easy
terms
that
offered
there
was
that
to
do
which
made
his
cheek
burn
as
he
thought
of
it
but
he
was
going
to
do
it
even
though
it
lost
her
to
him
just
to
see
her
and
kneel
to
her
was
joy
sufficient
to
sustain
him
and
warm
his
blood
in
the
prospect
they
marked
the
white
cliffs
growing
over
the
water
nearer
the
sun
made
them
lustrous
houses
and
people
seemed
to
welcome
the
wild
youth
to
common
sense
simplicity
and
home
they
were
in
town
by
richard
had
a
momentary
idea
of
not
driving
to
his
hotel
for
letters
after
a
short
debate
he
determined
to
go
there
the
porter
said
he
had
two
letters
for
richard
feverel
one
had
been
waiting
some
time
he
went
to
the
box
and
fetched
them
the
first
richard
opened
was
from
lucy
and
as
he
read
it
ripton
observed
the
colour
deepen
on
his
face
while
a
quivering
smile
played
about
his
mouth
he
opened
the
other
indifferently
it
began
without
any
form
of
address
richard
forehead
darkened
at
the
signature
this
letter
was
in
a
sloping
feminine
hand
and
flourished
with
light
strokes
all
over
like
a
field
of
the
bearded
barley
thus
it
ran
i
know
you
are
in
a
rage
with
me
because
i
would
not
consent
to
ruin
you
you
foolish
fellow
what
do
you
call
it
going
to
that
unpleasant
place
together
thank
you
my
milliner
is
not
ready
yet
and
i
want
to
make
a
good
appearance
when
i
do
go
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
some
day
your
health
sir
richard
now
let
me
speak
to
you
seriously
go
home
to
your
wife
at
once
but
i
know
the
sort
of
fellow
you
are
and
i
must
be
plain
with
you
did
i
ever
say
i
loved
you
you
may
hate
me
as
much
as
you
please
but
i
will
save
you
from
being
a
fool
now
listen
to
me
you
know
my
relations
with
mount
that
beast
brayder
offered
to
pay
all
my
debts
and
set
me
afloat
if
i
would
keep
you
in
town
i
declare
on
my
honour
i
had
no
idea
why
and
i
did
not
agree
to
it
but
you
were
such
a
handsome
fellow
i
noticed
you
in
the
park
before
i
heard
a
word
of
you
but
then
you
fought
shy
you
were
just
as
tempting
as
a
girl
you
stung
me
do
you
know
what
that
is
i
would
make
you
care
for
me
and
we
know
how
it
ended
without
any
intention
of
mine
i
swear
i
have
cut
off
my
hand
rather
than
do
you
any
harm
upon
my
honour
circumstances
then
i
saw
it
was
all
up
between
us
brayder
came
and
began
to
chaff
about
you
i
dealt
the
animal
a
stroke
on
the
face
with
my
i
shut
him
up
pretty
quick
do
you
think
i
would
let
a
man
speak
about
you
i
was
going
to
swear
you
see
i
remember
dick
lessons
o
my
god
i
do
feel
brayder
offered
me
money
go
and
think
i
took
it
if
you
like
what
do
i
care
what
anybody
thinks
something
that
said
made
me
suspicious
i
went
down
to
the
isle
of
wight
where
mount
was
and
your
wife
was
just
gone
with
an
old
lady
who
came
and
took
her
away
i
should
so
have
liked
to
see
her
you
said
you
remember
she
would
take
me
as
a
sister
and
treat
me
i
laughed
at
it
then
my
god
how
i
could
cry
now
if
water
did
any
good
to
a
devil
as
you
politely
call
poor
me
i
called
at
your
house
and
saw
your
who
said
mount
had
just
been
there
in
a
minute
it
struck
me
i
was
sure
mount
was
after
a
woman
but
it
never
struck
me
that
woman
was
your
wife
then
i
saw
why
they
wanted
me
to
keep
you
away
i
went
to
brayder
you
know
how
i
hate
him
i
made
love
to
the
man
to
get
it
out
of
him
richard
my
word
of
honour
they
have
planned
to
carry
her
off
if
mount
finds
he
can
not
seduce
her
talk
of
devils
he
one
but
he
is
not
so
bad
as
brayder
i
can
not
forgive
a
mean
dog
his
villany
now
after
this
i

too
much
of
a
man
to
stop
away
from
her

moment

more
to
say
i
suppose

shall
not

other
again
so
dick
i
fancy
i
hear
you
cursing
me
why
ca
you

like

men
on
the
subject
but
if

like
the
rest
of
them

should
not
have
cared
for
you
a
farthing
i
have
not
worn
lilac
since
i
saw
you

i
be
buried
in
your
colour
dick
that

not
offend
you
will
it
you
are
not
going
to
believe
i
took
the
money
if
i
thought
you
thought
that
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
devil
only
to
fancy
you
think
it
the
first
time

meet
brayder
cane
him
publicly
adieu

it
because
you

like
his
face

day

death
if

or
ever
will
touch

scrap
of
their
money
bella
richard
folded
up
the
letter
silently
jump
into
the
cab
he
said
to
ripton
anything
the
matter
richard
no
the
driver
received
directions
richard
sat
without
speaking
his
friend
knew
that
face
he
asked
whether
there
was
bad
news
in
the
letter
for
answer
he
had
the
lie
circumstancial
he
ventured
to
remark
that
they
were
going
the
wrong
way
it
the
right
way
cried
richard
and
his
jaws
were
hard
and
square
and
his
eyes
looked
heavy
and
full
ripton
said
no
more
but
thought
the
cabman
pulled
up
at
a
club
a
gentleman
in
whom
ripton
recognized
the
hon
peter
brayder
was
just
then
swinging
a
leg
over
his
horse
with
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
hearing
his
name
called
the
hon
peter
turned
about
and
stretched
an
affable
hand
is
mountfalcon
in
town
said
richard
taking
the
horse
reins
instead
of
the
gentlemanly
hand
his
voice
and
aspect
were
quite
friendly
mount
brayder
replied
curiously
watching
the
action
yes
he
off
this
evening
he
is
in
town
richard
released
his
horse
i
want
to
see
him
where
is
he
the
young
man
looked
pleasant
that
which
might
have
aroused
suspicions
was
an
old
affair
in
parasitical
register
by
this
time
want
to
see
him
what
about
he
said
carelessly
and
gave
the
address
by
the
way
he
sang
out
we
thought
of
putting
your
name
down
feverel
he
indicated
the
lofty
structure
what
do
you
say
richard
nodded
back
at
him
crying
hurry
brayder
returned
the
nod
and
those
who
promenaded
the
district
soon
beheld
his
body
in
elegant
motion
to
the
stepping
of
his
horse
what
do
you
want
to
see
lord
mountfalcon
for
richard
said
ripton
i
just
want
to
see
him
richard
replied
ripton
was
left
in
the
cab
at
the
door
of
my
lord
residence
he
had
to
wait
there
a
space
of
about
ten
minutes
when
richard
returned
with
a
clearer
visage
though
somewhat
heated
he
stood
outside
the
cab
and
ripton
was
conscious
of
being
examined
by
those
strong
grey
eyes
as
clear
as
speech
he
understood
them
to
say
to
him
you
wo
do
but
which
of
the
many
things
on
earth
he
would
not
do
for
he
was
at
a
loss
to
think
go
down
to
raynham
ripton
say
i
shall
be
there
tonight
certainly
do
bother
me
with
questions
drive
off
at
once
or
wait
get
another
cab
i
take
this
ripton
was
ejected
and
found
himself
standing
alone
in
the
street
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
rushing
after
the
galloping
to
get
a
word
of
elucidation
he
heard
some
one
speak
behind
him
you
are
feverel
friend
ripton
had
an
eye
for
lords
an
ambrosial
footman
standing
at
the
open
door
of
lord
mountfalcon
house
and
a
gentleman
standing
on
the
doorstep
told
him
that
he
was
addressed
by
that
nobleman
he
was
requested
to
step
into
the
house
when
they
were
alone
lord
mountfalcon
slightly
ruffled
said
feverel
has
insulted
me
grossly
i
must
meet
him
of
course
it
a
piece
of
infernal
folly
i
suppose
he
is
not
quite
mad
ripton
only
definite
answer
was
a
gasping
iteration
of
my
lord
my
lord
resumed
i
am
perfectly
guiltless
of
offending
him
as
far
as
i
know
in
fact
i
had
a
friendship
for
him
is
he
liable
to
fits
of
this
sort
of
thing
not
yet
at
ripton
stammered
fits
my
lord
ah
went
the
other
eying
ripton
in
lordly
cognizant
style
you
know
nothing
of
this
business
perhaps
ripton
said
he
did
not
have
you
any
influence
with
him
not
much
my
lord
only
now
and
then
a
little
you
are
not
in
the
army
the
question
was
quite
unnecessary
ripton
confessed
to
the
law
and
my
lord
did
not
look
surprised
i
will
not
detain
you
he
said
distantly
bowing
ripton
gave
him
a
commoner
obeisance
but
getting
to
the
door
the
sense
of
the
matter
enlightened
him
it
a
duel
my
lord
no
help
for
it
if
his
friends
do
shut
him
up
in
bedlam
between
this
and
morning
of
all
horrible
things
a
duel
was
the
worst
in
ripton
imagination
he
stood
holding
the
handle
of
the
door
revolving
this
last
chapter
of
calamity
suddenly
opened
where
happiness
had
promised
a
duel
but
he
wo
my
lord
he
must
fight
my
lord
he
must
come
on
the
ground
said
my
lord
positively
ripton
ejaculated
unintelligible
stuff
finally
lord
mountfalcon
said
i
went
out
of
my
way
sir
in
speaking
to
you
i
saw
you
from
the
window
your
friend
is
mad
deuced
methodical
i
admit
but
mad
i
have
particular
reasons
to
wish
not
to
injure
the
young
man
and
if
an
apology
is
to
be
got
out
of
him
when
we
on
the
ground
i
take
it
and
we
stop
the
damned
scandal
if
possible
you
understand
i
the
insulted
party
and
i
shall
only
require
of
him
to
use
formal
words
of
excuse
to
come
to
an
amicable
settlement
let
him
just
say
he
regrets
it
now
sir
the
nobleman
spoke
with
considerable
earnestness
should
anything
happen
i
have
the
honour
to
be
known
to
feverel
and
i
beg
you
will
tell
her
i
very
particularly
desire
you
to
let
her
know
that
i
was
not
to
blame
mountfalcon
rang
the
bell
and
bowed
him
out
with
this
on
his
mind
ripton
hurried
down
to
those
who
were
waiting
in
joyful
trust
at
raynham
chapter
xliv
the
watch
consulted
by
hippias
alternately
with
his
pulse
in
occult
calculation
hideous
to
mark
said
eleven
on
the
midnight
adrian
wearing
a
composedly
amused
expression
on
his
dimpled
plump
face
held
slightly
sideways
aloof
from
paper
and
pen
sat
writing
at
the
library
table
round
the
baronet
chair
in
a
were
lucy
lady
blandish
doria
and
ripton
that
very
ill
bird
at
raynham
they
were
silent
as
those
who
question
the
flying
minutes
ripton
had
said
that
richard
was
sure
to
come
but
the
feminine
eyes
reading
him
ever
and
anon
had
gathered
matter
for
disquietude
which
increased
as
time
sped
sir
austin
persisted
in
his
habitual
air
of
speculative
repose
remote
as
he
appeared
from
vulgar
anxiety
he
was
the
first
to
speak
and
betray
his
state
pray
put
up
that
watch
impatience
serves
nothing
he
said
turning
hastily
to
his
brother
behind
him
hippias
relinquished
his
pulse
and
mildly
groaned
it
no
nightmare
this
his
remark
was
unheard
and
the
bearing
of
it
remained
obscure
pen
made
a
louder
flourish
on
his
manuscript
whether
in
commiseration
or
infernal
glee
none
might
say
what
are
you
writing
the
baronet
inquired
testily
of
adrian
after
a
pause
twitched
it
may
be
by
a
sort
of
jealousy
of
the
wise
coolness
do
i
disturb
you
sir
rejoined
adrian
i
am
engaged
on
a
portion
of
a
proposal
for
uniting
the
empires
and
kingdoms
of
europe
under
one
paternal
head
on
the
model
of
the
and
lamented
holy
roman
this
treats
of
the
management
of
youths
and
maids
and
of
certain
magisterial
functions
connected
therewith
is
decreed
that
these
officers
be
all
and
every
men
of
science
etc
and
adrian
cheerily
drove
his
pen
afresh
doria
took
lucy
hand
mutely
addressing
encouragement
to
her
and
lucy
brought
as
much
of
a
smile
as
she
could
command
to
reply
with
i
fear
we
must
give
him
up
observed
lady
blandish
if
he
said
he
would
come
he
will
come
sir
austin
interjected
between
him
and
the
lady
there
was
something
of
a
contest
secretly
going
on
he
was
conscious
that
nothing
save
perfect
success
would
now
hold
this
mind
she
had
seen
him
through
he
declared
to
me
he
would
be
certain
to
come
said
ripton
but
he
could
look
at
none
of
them
as
he
said
it
for
he
was
growing
aware
that
richard
might
have
deceived
him
and
was
feeling
like
a
black
conspirator
against
their
happiness
he
determined
to
tell
the
baronet
what
he
knew
if
richard
did
not
come
by
twelve
what
is
the
time
he
asked
hippias
in
a
modest
voice
time
for
me
to
be
in
bed
growled
hippias
as
if
everybody
present
had
been
treating
him
badly
berry
came
in
to
apprise
lucy
that
she
was
wanted
above
she
quietly
rose
sir
austin
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
saying
you
had
better
not
come
down
again
my
child
she
kept
her
eyes
on
him
oblige
me
by
retiring
for
the
night
he
added
lucy
shook
their
hands
and
went
out
accompanied
by
doria
this
agitation
will
be
bad
for
the
child
he
said
speaking
to
himself
aloud
lady
blandish
remarked
i
think
she
might
just
as
well
have
returned
she
will
not
sleep
she
will
control
herself
for
the
child
sake
you
ask
too
much
of
her
of
her
not
he
emphasized
it
was
twelve
when
hippies
shut
his
watch
and
said
with
vehemence
i
convinced
my
circulation
gradually
and
steadily
decreases
going
back
to
the
period
murmured
adrian
as
he
wrote
sir
austin
and
lady
blandish
knew
well
that
any
comment
would
introduce
them
to
the
interior
of
his
machinery
the
eternal
view
of
which
was
sufficiently
harrowing
so
they
maintained
a
discreet
reserve
taking
it
for
acquiescence
in
his
deplorable
condition
hippies
resumed
despairingly
it
a
fact
i
brought
you
to
see
that
no
one
can
be
more
moderate
than
i
am
and
yet
i
get
worse
my
system
is
organically
sound
i
believe
i
do
every
possible
thing
and
yet
i
get
worse
nature
never
forgives
i
go
to
bed
the
dyspepsy
departed
unconsoled
sir
austin
took
up
his
brother
thought
i
suppose
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
helps
us
when
we
have
offended
her
nothing
short
of
a
quack
satisfies
us
said
adrian
applying
wax
to
an
envelope
of
official
dimensions
ripton
sat
accusing
his
soul
of
cowardice
while
they
talked
haunted
by
lucy
last
look
at
him
he
got
up
his
courage
presently
and
went
round
to
adrian
who
after
a
few
whispered
words
deliberately
rose
and
accompanied
him
out
of
the
room
shrugging
when
they
had
gone
lady
blandish
said
to
the
baronet
he
is
not
coming
then
if
not
tonight
he
replied
but
i
say
he
will
come
you
do
really
wish
to
see
him
united
to
his
wife
the
question
made
the
baronet
raise
his
brows
with
some
displeasure
can
you
ask
me
i
mean
said
the
ungenerous
woman
your
system
will
require
no
further
sacrifices
from
either
of
them
when
he
did
answer
it
was
to
say
i
think
her
altogether
a
superior
person
i
confess
i
should
scarcely
have
hoped
to
find
one
like
her
admit
that
your
science
does
not
accomplish
everything
no
it
was
presumptuous
beyond
a
certain
point
said
the
baronet
meaning
deep
things
lady
blandish
eyed
him
ah
me
she
sighed
if
we
would
always
be
true
to
our
own
wisdom
you
are
very
singular
emmeline
sir
austin
stopped
his
walk
in
front
of
her
in
truth
was
she
not
unjust
here
was
an
offending
son
freely
forgiven
here
was
a
young
woman
of
humble
birth
freely
accepted
into
his
family
and
permitted
to
stand
upon
her
qualities
who
would
have
done
more
or
as
much
this
lady
for
instance
had
the
case
been
hers
would
have
fought
it
all
the
people
of
position
that
he
was
acquainted
with
would
have
fought
it
and
that
without
feeling
it
so
peculiarly
but
while
the
baronet
thought
this
he
did
not
think
of
the
exceptional
education
his
son
had
received
he
took
the
common
ground
of
fathers
forgetting
his
system
when
it
was
absolutely
on
trial
false
to
his
son
it
could
not
be
said
that
he
had
been
false
to
his
system
he
was
others
saw
it
plainly
but
he
had
to
learn
his
lesson
by
and
by
lady
blandish
gave
him
her
face
then
stretched
her
hand
to
the
table
saying
well
well
she
fingered
a
parcel
lying
there
and
drew
forth
a
little
book
she
recognized
ha
what
is
this
she
said
benson
returned
it
this
morning
he
informed
her
the
stupid
fellow
took
it
away
with
him
by
mischance
i
am
bound
to
believe
it
was
nothing
other
than
the
old
lady
blandish
turned
over
the
leaves
and
came
upon
the
later
jottings
she
read
a
maker
of
proverbs
what
is
he
but
a
narrow
mind
with
the
mouthpiece
of
narrower
i
do
not
agree
with
that
she
observed
he
was
in
no
humour
for
argument
was
your
humility
feigned
when
you
wrote
it
he
merely
said
consider
the
sort
of
minds
influenced
by
set
sayings
a
proverb
is
the
to
an
idea
i
conceive
and
the
majority
rest
there
content
can
the
keeper
of
such
a
house
be
flattered
by
his
company
she
felt
her
feminine
intelligence
swaying
under
him
again
there
must
be
greatness
in
a
man
who
could
thus
speak
of
his
own
special
and
admirable
aptitude
further
she
read
which
is
the
coward
among
us
he
who
sneers
at
the
failings
of
humanity
oh
that
is
true
how
much
i
admire
that
cried
the
dame
as
she
beamed
intellectual
raptures
another
aphorism
seemed
closely
to
apply
to
him
there
is
no
more
grievous
sight
as
there
is
no
greater
perversion
than
a
wise
man
at
the
mercy
of
his
feelings
he
must
have
written
it
she
thought
when
he
had
himself
for
an
example
strange
man
that
he
is
lady
blandish
was
still
inclined
to
submission
though
decidedly
insubordinate
she
had
once
been
fairly
conquered
but
if
what
she
reverenced
as
a
great
mind
could
conquer
her
it
must
be
a
great
man
that
should
hold
her
captive
the
autumn
primrose
blooms
for
the
loftiest
manhood
is
a
vindictive
flower
in
lesser
hands
nevertheless
sir
austin
had
only
to
be
successful
and
this
lady
allegiance
was
his
for
ever
the
trial
was
at
hand
she
said
again
he
is
not
coming
and
the
baronet
on
whose
visage
a
contemplative
pleased
look
had
been
rising
for
a
minute
past
quietly
added
he
is
come
richard
voice
was
heard
in
the
hall
there
was
commotion
all
over
the
house
at
the
return
of
the
young
heir
berry
seizing
every
possible
occasion
to
approach
his
bessy
now
that
her
involuntary
coldness
had
enhanced
her
value
such
is
men
as
the
soft
woman
reflected
berry
ascended
to
her
and
delivered
the
news
in
pompous
tones
and
wheedling
gestures
the
best
word
you
spoke
for
many
a
day
says
she
and
leaves
him
unfee
in
an
attitude
to
hurry
and
pour
bliss
into
lucy
ears
lord
be
praised
she
entered
the
adjoining
room
exclaiming
we
got
to
be
happy
at
last
they
men
have
come
to
their
senses
i
could
cry
to
your
virgin
and
kiss
your
cross
you
sweet
hush
lucy
admonished
her
and
crooned
over
the
child
on
her
knees
the
tiny
open
hands
full
of
sleep
clutched
the
large
blue
eyes
started
awake
and
his
mother
all
trembling
and
palpitating
knowing
but
thirsting
to
hear
it
covered
him
with
her
tresses
and
tried
to
still
her
frame
and
rocked
and
sang
low
interdicting
even
a
whisper
from
bursting
berry
richard
had
come
he
was
under
his
father
roof
in
the
old
home
that
had
so
soon
grown
foreign
to
him
he
stood
close
to
his
wife
and
child
he
might
embrace
them
both
and
now
the
fulness
of
his
anguish
and
the
madness
of
the
thing
he
had
done
smote
the
young
man
now
first
he
tasted
hard
earthly
misery
had
not
god
spoken
to
him
in
the
tempest
had
not
the
finger
of
heaven
directed
him
homeward
and
he
had
come
here
he
stood
congratulations
were
thick
in
his
ears
the
cup
of
happiness
was
held
to
him
and
he
was
invited
to
drink
of
it
which
was
the
dream
his
work
for
the
morrow
or
this
but
for
a
leaden
load
that
he
felt
like
a
bullet
in
his
breast
he
might
have
thought
the
morrow
with
death
sitting
on
it
was
the
dream
yes
he
was
awake
now
first
the
cloud
of
phantasms
cleared
away
he
beheld
his
real
life
and
the
colours
of
true
human
joy
and
on
the
morrow
perhaps
he
was
to
close
his
eyes
on
them
that
leaden
bullet
dispersed
all
unrealities
they
stood
about
him
in
the
hall
his
father
lady
blandish
doria
adrian
ripton
people
who
had
known
him
long
they
shook
his
hand
they
gave
him
greetings
he
had
never
before
understood
the
worth
of
or
the
meaning
now
that
he
did
they
mocked
him
there
was
berry
in
the
background
bobbing
there
was
martin
berry
bowing
there
was
tom
bakewell
grinning
somehow
he
loved
the
sight
of
these
better
ah
my
old
penelope
he
said
breaking
through
the
circle
of
his
relatives
to
go
to
her
tom
how
are
you
bless
ye
my
mr
richard
whimpered
berry
and
whispered
rosily
all
agreeable
now
she
waiting
up
in
bed
for
ye
like
a
the
person
who
betrayed
most
agitation
was
doria
she
held
close
to
him
and
eagerly
studied
his
face
and
every
movement
as
one
accustomed
to
masks
you
are
pale
richard
he
pleaded
exhaustion
what
detained
you
dear
business
he
said
she
drew
him
imperiously
apart
from
the
others
richard
is
it
over
he
asked
what
she
meant
the
dreadful
duel
richard
he
looked
darkly
is
it
over
is
it
done
richard
getting
no
immediate
answer
she
continued
and
such
was
her
agitation
that
the
words
were
shaken
by
pieces
from
her
mouth
do
pretend
not
to
understand
me
richard
is
it
over
are
you
going
to
die
the
death
of
my
child
clare
death
is
not
one
in
a
family
enough
think
of
your
dear
young
wife
we
love
her
so
your
child
your
father
will
you
kill
us
all
doria
had
chanced
to
overhear
a
trifle
of
ripton
communication
to
adrian
and
had
built
thereon
with
the
dark
forces
of
a
stricken
soul
wondering
how
this
woman
could
have
divined
it
richard
calmly
said
it
arranged
the
matter
you
allude
to
indeed
truly
dear
yes
tell
me
but
he
broke
away
from
her
saying
you
shall
hear
the
particulars
and
she
not
alive
to
double
meaning
just
then
allowed
him
to
leave
her
he
had
eaten
nothing
for
twelve
hours
and
called
for
food
but
he
would
take
only
dry
bread
and
claret
which
was
served
on
a
tray
in
the
library
he
said
without
any
show
of
feeling
that
he
must
eat
before
he
saw
the
young
hope
of
raynham
so
there
he
sat
breaking
bread
and
eating
great
mouthfuls
and
washing
them
down
with
wine
talking
of
what
they
would
his
father
studious
mind
felt
itself
years
behind
him
he
was
so
completely
altered
he
had
the
precision
of
speech
the
bearing
of
a
man
of
thirty
indeed
he
had
all
that
the
necessity
for
cloaking
an
infinite
misery
gives
but
let
things
be
as
they
might
he
was
there
for
one
night
in
his
life
sir
austin
perspective
of
the
future
was
bounded
by
the
night
will
your
go
to
your
wife
now
he
had
asked
and
richard
had
replied
with
a
strange
indifference
the
baronet
thought
it
better
that
their
meeting
should
be
private
and
sent
word
for
lucy
to
wait
upstairs
the
others
perceived
that
father
and
son
should
now
be
left
alone
adrian
went
up
to
him
and
said
i
can
no
longer
witness
this
painful
sight
so
sir
famish
you
may
cheat
yourself
into
the
belief
that
you
made
a
meal
but
depend
upon
it
your
progeny
and
it
threatens
to
be
numerous
will
cry
aloud
and
rue
the
day
nature
never
forgives
a
lost
dinner
can
never
be
replaced
my
dear
boy
and
here
oblige
me
by
taking
this
he
handed
richard
the
enormous
envelope
containing
what
he
had
written
that
evening
credentials
he
exclaimed
humorously
slapping
richard
on
the
shoulder
ripton
heard
also
the
words
propagator
species
but
had
no
idea
of
their
import
the
wise
youth
looked
you
see
we
made
matters
all
right
for
you
here
and
quitted
the
room
on
that
unusual
gleam
of
earnestness
richard
shook
his
hand
and
ripton
then
lady
blandish
said
her
night
praising
lucy
and
promising
to
pray
for
their
mutual
happiness
the
two
men
who
knew
what
was
hanging
over
him
spoke
together
outside
ripton
was
for
getting
a
positive
assurance
that
the
duel
would
not
be
fought
but
adrian
said
time
enough
tomorrow
he
safe
enough
while
he
here
i
stop
it
ending
with
banter
of
ripton
and
allusions
to
his
adventures
with
miss
random
which
must
adrian
said
have
led
him
into
many
affairs
of
the
sort
certainly
richard
was
there
and
while
he
was
there
he
must
be
safe
so
thought
ripton
and
went
to
his
bed
doria
deliberated
likewise
and
likewise
thought
him
safe
while
he
was
there
for
once
in
her
life
she
thought
it
better
not
to
trust
to
her
instinct
for
fear
of
useless
disturbance
where
peace
should
be
so
she
said
not
a
syllable
of
it
to
her
brother
she
only
looked
more
deeply
into
richard
eyes
as
she
kissed
him
praising
lucy
i
have
found
a
second
daughter
in
her
dear
oh
may
you
both
be
happy
they
all
praised
lucy
now
his
father
commenced
the
moment
they
were
alone
poor
helen
your
wife
has
been
a
great
comfort
to
her
richard
i
think
helen
must
have
sunk
without
her
so
lovely
a
young
person
possessing
mental
faculty
and
a
conscience
for
her
duties
i
have
never
before
met
he
wished
to
gratify
his
son
by
these
eulogies
of
lucy
and
some
hours
back
he
would
have
succeeded
now
it
had
the
contrary
effect
you
compliment
me
on
my
choice
sir
richard
spoke
sedately
but
the
irony
was
perceptible
and
he
could
speak
no
other
way
his
bitterness
was
so
intense
i
think
you
very
fortunate
said
his
father
sensitive
to
tone
and
manner
as
he
was
his
ebullition
of
paternal
feeling
was
frozen
richard
did
not
approach
him
he
leaned
against
the
glancing
at
the
floor
and
lifting
his
eyes
only
when
he
spoke
fortunate
very
fortunate
as
he
revolved
his
later
history
and
remembered
how
clearly
he
had
seen
that
his
father
must
love
lucy
if
he
but
knew
her
and
remembered
his
efforts
to
persuade
her
to
come
with
him
a
sting
of
miserable
rage
blackened
his
brain
but
could
he
blame
that
gentle
soul
whom
could
he
blame
himself
not
utterly
his
father
yes
and
no
the
blame
was
here
the
blame
was
there
it
was
everywhere
and
nowhere
and
the
young
man
cast
it
on
the
fates
and
looked
angrily
at
heaven
and
grew
reckless
richard
said
his
father
coming
close
to
him
it
is
late
i
do
not
wish
lucy
to
remain
in
expectation
longer
or
i
should
have
explained
myself
to
you
thoroughly
and
i
think
or
at
least
hope
you
would
have
justified
me
i
had
cause
to
believe
that
you
had
not
only
violated
my
confidence
but
grossly
deceived
me
it
was
not
so
i
now
know
i
was
mistaken
much
of
our
misunderstanding
has
resulted
from
that
mistake
but
you
were
married
a
boy
you
knew
nothing
of
the
world
little
of
yourself
to
save
you
in
for
there
is
a
period
when
mature
men
and
women
who
have
married
young
are
more
impelled
to
temptation
than
in
youth
though
not
so
exposed
to
it
to
save
you
i
say
i
decreed
that
you
should
experience
and
learn
something
of
your
fellows
of
both
sexes
before
settling
into
a
state
that
must
have
been
otherwise
precarious
however
excellent
the
woman
who
is
your
mate
my
system
with
you
would
have
been
otherwise
imperfect
and
you
would
have
felt
the
effects
of
it
it
is
over
now
you
are
a
man
the
dangers
to
which
your
nature
was
open
are
i
trust
at
an
end
i
wish
you
to
be
happy
and
i
give
you
both
my
blessing
and
pray
god
to
conduct
and
strengthen
you
both
sir
austin
mind
was
unconscious
of
not
having
spoken
devoutly
true
or
not
his
words
were
idle
to
his
son
his
talk
of
dangers
over
and
happiness
mockery
richard
coldly
took
his
father
extended
hand
we
will
go
to
her
said
the
baronet
i
will
leave
you
at
her
door
not
moving
looking
fixedly
at
his
father
with
a
hard
face
on
which
the
colour
rushed
richard
said
a
husband
who
has
been
unfaithful
to
his
wife
may
go
to
her
there
sir
it
was
horrible
it
was
cruel
richard
knew
that
he
wanted
no
advice
on
such
a
matter
having
fully
resolved
what
to
do
yesterday
he
would
have
listened
to
his
father
and
blamed
himself
alone
and
done
what
was
to
be
done
humbly
before
god
and
her
now
in
the
recklessness
of
his
misery
he
had
as
little
pity
for
any
other
soul
as
for
his
own
sir
austin
brows
were
deep
drawn
down
what
did
you
say
richard
clearly
his
intelligence
had
taken
it
but
this
the
worst
he
could
that
he
had
dreaded
once
and
doubted
and
smoothed
over
and
cast
aside
could
it
be
richard
said
i
told
you
all
but
the
very
words
when
we
last
parted
what
else
do
you
think
would
have
kept
me
from
her
angered
at
his
callous
aspect
his
father
cried
what
brings
you
to
her
now
that
will
be
between
us
two
was
the
reply
sir
austin
fell
into
his
chair
meditation
was
impossible
he
spoke
from
a
wrathful
heart
you
will
not
dare
to
take
her
without
no
sir
richard
interrupted
him
i
shall
not
have
no
fear
then
you
did
not
love
your
wife
did
i
not
a
smile
passed
faintly
over
richard
face
did
you
care
so
much
for
this
this
other
person
so
much
if
you
ask
me
whether
i
had
affection
for
her
i
can
say
i
had
none
o
base
human
nature
then
how
then
why
a
thousand
questions
rose
in
the
baronet
mind
bessy
berry
could
have
answered
them
every
one
poor
child
poor
child
he
apostrophized
lucy
pacing
the
room
thinking
of
her
knowing
her
deep
love
for
his
son
her
true
forgiving
heart
it
seemed
she
should
be
spared
this
misery
he
proposed
to
richard
to
spare
her
vast
is
the
distinction
between
women
and
men
in
this
one
sin
he
said
and
supported
it
with
physical
and
moral
citations
his
argument
carried
him
so
far
that
to
hear
him
one
would
have
imagined
he
thought
the
sin
in
men
small
indeed
his
words
were
idle
she
must
know
it
said
richard
sternly
i
will
go
to
her
now
sir
if
you
please
sir
austin
detained
him
expostulated
contradicted
himself
confounded
his
principles
made
nonsense
of
all
his
theories
he
could
not
induce
his
son
to
waver
in
his
resolve
ultimately
their
being
interchanged
he
understood
that
the
happiness
of
raynham
depended
on
lucy
mercy
he
had
no
fears
of
her
sweet
heart
but
it
was
a
strange
thing
to
have
come
to
on
which
should
the
accusation
fall
on
science
or
on
human
nature
he
remained
in
the
library
pondering
over
the
question
at
times
breathing
contempt
for
his
son
and
again
seized
with
unwonted
suspicion
of
his
own
wisdom
troubled
much
to
be
pitied
even
if
he
deserved
that
blow
from
his
son
which
had
plunged
him
into
wretchedness
richard
went
straight
to
tom
bakewell
roused
the
heavy
sleeper
and
told
him
to
have
his
mare
saddled
and
waiting
at
the
park
gates
east
within
an
hour
tom
nearest
approach
to
a
hero
was
to
be
a
faithful
slave
to
his
master
and
in
doing
this
he
acted
to
his
conception
of
that
high
and
glorious
character
he
got
up
and
heroically
dashed
his
head
into
cold
water
she
shall
be
ready
sir
he
nodded
tom
if
you
do
see
me
back
here
at
raynham
your
money
will
go
on
being
paid
to
you
rather
see
you
than
the
money
richard
said
tom
and
you
will
always
watch
and
see
no
harm
comes
to
her
tom
richard
sir
tom
stared
god
bless
me
richard
no
questions
you
do
what
i
say
ay
sir
that
i
will
isle
o
wight
the
very
name
of
the
island
shocked
richard
blood
and
he
had
to
walk
up
and
down
before
he
could
knock
at
lucy
door
that
infamous
conspiracy
to
which
he
owed
his
degradation
and
misery
scarce
left
him
the
feelings
of
a
man
when
he
thought
of
it
the
soft
beloved
voice
responded
to
his
knock
he
opened
the
door
and
stood
before
her
lucy
was
toward
him
in
the
moment
that
passed
ere
she
was
in
his
arms
he
had
time
to
observe
the
change
in
her
he
had
left
her
a
girl
he
beheld
a
woman
a
blooming
woman
for
pale
at
first
no
sooner
did
she
see
him
than
the
colour
was
rich
and
deep
on
her
face
and
neck
and
bosom
half
shown
through
the
loose
and
the
sense
of
her
exceeding
beauty
made
his
heart
thump
and
his
eyes
swim
my
darling
each
cried
and
they
clung
together
and
her
mouth
was
fastened
on
his
they
spoke
no
more
his
soul
was
drowned
in
her
kiss
supporting
her
whose
strength
was
gone
he
almost
as
weak
as
she
hung
over
her
and
clasped
her
closer
closer
till
they
were
as
one
body
and
in
the
oblivion
her
lips
put
upon
him
he
was
free
to
the
bliss
of
her
embrace
heaven
granted
him
that
he
placed
her
in
a
chair
and
knelt
at
her
feet
with
both
arms
around
her
her
bosom
heaved
her
eyes
never
quitted
him
their
light
as
the
light
on
a
rolling
wave
this
young
creature
commonly
so
frank
and
straightforward
was
broken
with
bashfulness
in
her
husband
arms
womanly
bashfulness
on
the
torrent
of
womanly
love
tenfold
more
seductive
than
the
bashfulness
of
girlhood
terrible
tenfold
the
loss
of
her
seemed
now
as
distantly
far
on
the
horizon
of
memory
the
fatal
truth
returned
to
him
lose
her
lose
this
he
looked
up
as
if
to
ask
god
to
confirm
it
the
same
sweet
blue
eyes
the
eyes
that
he
had
often
seen
in
the
dying
glories
of
evening
on
him
they
dwelt
shifting
and
fluttering
and
glittering
but
constant
the
light
of
them
as
the
light
on
a
rolling
wave
and
true
to
him
true
good
glorious
as
the
angels
of
heaven
and
his
she
was
a
woman
his
wife
the
temptation
to
take
her
and
be
dumb
was
all
powerful
the
wish
to
die
against
her
bosom
so
strong
as
to
be
the
prayer
of
his
vital
forces
again
he
strained
her
to
him
but
this
time
it
was
as
a
robber
grasps
priceless
treasure
with
exultation
and
defiance
one
instant
of
this
lucy
whose
pure
tenderness
had
now
surmounted
the
first
wild
passion
of
their
meeting
bent
back
her
head
from
her
surrendered
body
and
said
almost
voicelessly
her
underlids
wistfully
quivering
come
and
see
him
baby
and
then
in
great
hope
of
the
happiness
she
was
going
to
give
her
husband
and
share
with
him
and
in
tremour
and
doubt
of
what
his
feelings
would
be
she
blushed
and
her
brows
worked
she
tried
to
throw
off
the
strangeness
of
a
year
of
separation
misunderstanding
and
uncertainty
darling
come
and
see
him
he
is
here
she
spoke
more
clearly
though
no
louder
richard
had
released
her
and
she
took
his
hand
and
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
his
heart
began
rapidly
throbbing
at
the
sight
of
a
little
cot
covered
with
lace
like
milky
summer
cloud
it
seemed
to
him
he
would
lose
his
manhood
if
he
looked
on
that
face
stop
he
cried
suddenly
lucy
turned
first
to
him
and
then
to
her
infant
fearing
it
should
have
been
disturbed
lucy
come
back
what
is
it
darling
said
she
in
alarm
at
his
voice
and
the
grip
he
had
unwittingly
given
her
hand
o
god
what
an
ordeal
was
this
that
he
must
face
death
perhaps
die
and
be
torn
from
his
darling
his
wife
and
his
child
and
that
ere
he
went
forth
ere
he
could
dare
to
see
his
child
and
lean
his
head
reproachfully
on
his
young
wife
breast
for
the
last
time
it
might
be
he
must
stab
her
to
the
heart
shatter
the
image
she
held
of
him
lucy
she
saw
him
wrenched
with
agony
and
her
own
face
took
the
whiteness
of
his
she
bending
forward
to
him
all
her
faculties
strung
to
hearing
he
held
her
two
hands
that
she
might
look
on
him
and
not
spare
the
horrible
wound
he
was
going
to
lay
open
to
her
eyes
lucy
do
you
know
why
i
came
to
you
she
moved
her
lips
repeating
his
words
lucy
have
you
guessed
why
i
did
not
come
before
her
head
shook
widened
eyes
lucy
i
did
not
come
because
i
was
not
worthy
of
my
wife
do
you
understand
darling
she
faltered
plaintively
and
hung
crouching
under
him
what
have
i
done
to
make
you
angry
with
me
o
beloved
cried
he
the
tears
bursting
out
of
his
eyes
o
beloved
was
all
he
could
say
kissing
her
hands
passionately
she
waited
reassured
but
in
terror
lucy
i
stayed
away
from
you
i
could
not
come
to
you
because
i
dared
not
come
to
you
my
wife
my
beloved
i
could
not
come
because
i
was
a
coward
because
hear
me
this
was
the
reason
i
have
broken
my
marriage
oath
again
her
lips
moved
she
caught
at
a
dim
fleshless
meaning
in
them
but
you
love
me
richard
my
husband
you
love
me
yes
i
have
never
loved
i
never
shall
love
woman
but
you
darling
kiss
me
have
you
understood
what
i
have
told
you
kiss
me
she
said
he
did
not
join
lips
i
have
come
to
you
to
ask
your
forgiveness
her
answer
was
kiss
me
can
you
forgive
a
man
so
base
but
you
love
me
richard
yes
that
i
can
say
before
god
i
love
you
and
i
have
betrayed
you
and
am
unworthy
of
you
not
worthy
to
touch
your
hand
to
kneel
at
your
feet
to
breathe
the
same
air
with
you
her
eyes
shone
brilliantly
you
love
me
you
love
me
darling
and
as
one
who
has
sailed
through
dark
fears
into
daylight
she
said
my
husband
my
darling
you
will
never
leave
me
we
never
shall
be
parted
again
he
drew
his
breath
painfully
to
smooth
her
face
growing
rigid
with
fresh
fears
at
his
silence
he
met
her
mouth
that
kiss
in
which
she
spoke
what
her
soul
had
to
say
calmed
her
and
she
smiled
happily
from
it
and
in
her
manner
reminded
him
of
his
first
vision
of
her
on
the
summer
morning
in
the
field
of
the
he
held
her
to
him
and
thought
then
of
a
holier
picture
of
mother
and
child
of
the
sweet
wonders
of
life
she
had
made
real
to
him
had
he
not
absolved
his
conscience
at
least
the
pangs
to
come
made
him
think
so
he
now
followed
her
leading
hand
lucy
whispered
you
must
disturb
him
must
touch
him
dear
and
with
dainty
fingers
drew
off
the
covering
to
the
little
shoulder
one
arm
of
the
child
was
out
along
the
pillow
the
small
hand
open
his
was
pouted
full
the
dark
lashes
of
his
eyes
seemed
to
lie
on
his
plump
cheeks
richard
stooped
lower
down
to
him
hungering
for
some
movement
as
a
sign
that
he
lived
lucy
whispered
he
sleeps
like
you
richard
one
arm
under
his
head
great
wonder
and
the
stir
of
a
grasping
tenderness
was
in
richard
he
breathed
quick
and
soft
bending
lower
till
curls
as
she
nestled
and
bent
with
him
rolled
on
the
crimson
quilt
of
the
cot
a
smile
went
up
the
plump
cheeks
forthwith
the
bud
of
a
mouth
was
in
rapid
motion
the
young
mother
whispered
blushing
dreaming
of
me
and
the
simple
words
did
more
than
richard
eyes
to
make
him
see
what
was
then
lucy
began
to
hum
and
buzz
sweet
language
and
some
of
the
tiny
fingers
stirred
and
he
made
as
if
to
change
his
cosy
position
but
reconsidered
and
deferred
it
with
a
peaceful
little
sigh
lucy
whispered
he
is
such
a
big
fellow
oh
when
you
see
him
awake
he
is
so
like
you
richard
he
did
not
hear
her
immediately
it
seemed
a
bit
of
heaven
dropped
there
in
his
likeness
the
more
human
the
fact
of
the
child
grew
the
more
heavenly
it
seemed
his
son
his
child
should
he
ever
see
him
awake
at
the
thought
he
took
the
words
that
had
been
spoken
and
started
from
the
dream
he
had
been
in
will
he
wake
soon
lucy
oh
no
not
yet
dear
not
for
hours
i
would
have
kept
him
awake
for
you
but
he
was
so
sleepy
richard
stood
back
from
the
cot
he
thought
that
if
he
saw
the
eyes
of
his
boy
and
had
him
once
on
his
heart
he
never
should
have
force
to
leave
him
then
he
looked
down
on
him
again
struggled
to
tear
himself
away
two
natures
warred
in
his
bosom
or
it
may
have
been
the
magian
conflict
still
going
on
he
had
come
to
see
his
child
once
and
to
make
peace
with
his
wife
before
it
should
be
too
late
might
he
not
stop
with
them
might
he
not
relinquish
that
devilish
pledge
was
not
divine
happiness
here
offered
to
him
if
foolish
ripton
had
not
delayed
to
tell
him
of
his
interview
with
mountfalcon
all
might
have
been
well
but
pride
said
it
was
impossible
and
then
injury
spoke
for
why
was
he
thus
base
and
spotted
to
the
darling
of
his
love
a
mad
pleasure
in
the
prospect
of
wreaking
vengeance
on
the
villain
who
had
laid
the
trap
for
him
once
more
blackened
his
brain
if
he
would
stay
he
could
not
so
he
resolved
throwing
the
burden
on
fate
the
struggle
was
over
but
oh
the
pain
lucy
beheld
the
tears
streaming
hot
from
his
face
on
the
child
cot
she
marvelled
at
such
excess
of
emotion
but
when
his
chest
heaved
and
the
extremity
of
mortal
anguish
appeared
to
have
seized
him
her
heart
sank
and
she
tried
to
get
him
in
her
arms
he
turned
away
from
her
and
went
to
the
window
a
was
over
the
lake
look
he
said
do
you
remember
our
rowing
there
one
night
and
we
saw
the
shadow
of
the
cypress
i
wish
i
could
have
come
early
that
we
might
have
had
another
row
and
i
have
heard
you
sing
there
darling
said
she
will
it
make
you
happier
if
i
go
with
you
now
i
will
no
lucy
lucy
you
are
brave
oh
no
that
i
not
i
thought
so
once
i
know
i
am
not
now
yes
to
have
lived
the
child
on
your
heart
and
never
to
have
uttered
a
complaint
you
are
brave
o
my
lucy
my
wife
you
that
have
made
me
man
i
called
you
a
coward
i
remember
it
i
was
the
coward
i
the
wretched
vain
fool
darling
i
am
going
to
leave
you
now
you
are
brave
and
you
will
bear
it
listen
in
two
days
or
three
i
may
be
back
back
for
good
if
you
will
accept
me
promise
me
to
go
to
bed
quietly
kiss
the
child
for
me
and
tell
him
his
father
has
seen
him
he
will
learn
to
speak
soon
will
he
soon
speak
lucy
dreadful
suspicion
kept
her
speechless
she
could
only
clutch
one
arm
of
his
with
both
her
hands
going
she
presently
gasped
for
two
or
three
days
no
more
i
hope
yes
now
going
now
my
husband
her
faculties
abandoned
her
you
will
be
brave
my
lucy
richard
my
darling
husband
going
what
is
it
takes
you
from
me
but
questioning
no
further
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
cried
piteously
to
him
to
stay
not
to
leave
them
then
she
dragged
him
to
the
little
sleeper
and
urged
him
to
pray
by
his
side
and
he
did
but
rose
abruptly
from
his
prayer
when
he
had
muttered
a
few
broken
words
she
praying
on
with
nerves
in
the
faith
that
what
she
said
to
the
interceding
mother
above
would
be
stronger
than
human
hands
on
him
nor
could
he
go
while
she
knelt
there
and
he
wavered
he
had
not
reckoned
on
her
terrible
suffering
she
came
to
him
quiet
i
knew
you
would
remain
and
taking
his
hand
innocently
fondling
it
am
i
so
changed
from
her
he
loved
you
will
not
leave
me
dear
but
dread
returned
and
the
words
quavered
as
she
spoke
them
he
was
almost
vanquished
by
the
loveliness
of
her
womanhood
she
drew
his
hand
to
her
heart
and
strained
it
there
under
one
breast
come
lie
on
my
heart
she
murmured
with
a
smile
of
holy
sweetness
he
wavered
more
and
drooped
to
her
but
summoning
the
powers
of
hell
kissed
her
suddenly
cried
the
words
of
parting
and
hurried
to
the
door
it
was
over
in
an
instant
she
cried
out
his
name
clinging
to
him
wildly
and
was
adjured
to
be
brave
for
he
would
be
dishonoured
if
he
did
not
go
then
she
was
shaken
off
berry
was
aroused
by
an
unusual
prolonged
wailing
of
the
child
which
showed
that
no
one
was
comforting
it
and
failing
to
get
any
answer
to
her
applications
for
admittance
she
made
bold
to
enter
there
she
saw
lucy
the
child
in
her
lap
sitting
on
the
floor
senseless
she
had
taken
it
from
its
sleep
and
tried
to
follow
her
husband
with
it
as
her
strongest
appeal
to
him
and
had
fainted
oh
my
oh
my
berry
moaned
and
i
just
now
thinkin
they
was
so
happy
warming
and
caressing
the
poor
infant
she
managed
by
degrees
to
revive
lucy
and
heard
what
had
brought
her
to
that
situation
go
to
his
father
said
berry
go
my
love
and
every
horse
in
raynham
shall
be
out
after
this
is
what
men
brings
us
to
or
you
take
blessed
baby
and
i
go
the
baronet
himself
knocked
at
the
door
what
is
this
he
said
i
heard
a
noise
and
a
step
descend
it
richard
have
gone
sir
austin
have
gone
from
his
wife
and
babe
oh
my
goodness
what
sorrow
come
on
us
and
berry
wept
and
sang
to
baby
and
baby
cried
vehemently
and
lucy
sobbing
took
him
and
danced
him
and
sang
to
him
with
drawn
lips
and
tears
dropping
over
him
and
if
the
scientific
humanist
to
the
day
of
his
death
forgets
the
sight
of
those
two
poor
true
women
jigging
on
their
wretched
hearts
to
calm
the
child
he
must
have
very
little
of
the
human
in
him
there
was
no
more
sleep
for
raynham
that
night
chapter
xlv
his
ordeal
is
over
i
have
just
come
from
his
room
and
seen
him
bear
the
worst
that
could
be
return
at
once
he
has
asked
for
you
i
can
hardly
write
intelligibly
but
i
will
tell
you
what
we
know
two
days
after
the
dreadful
night
when
he
left
us
his
father
heard
from
ralph
morton
richard
had
fought
a
duel
in
france
with
lord
mountfalcon
and
was
lying
wounded
at
a
hamlet
on
the
coast
his
father
started
immediately
with
his
poor
wife
and
i
followed
in
company
with
his
aunt
and
his
child
the
wound
was
not
dangerous
he
was
shot
in
the
side
somewhere
but
the
ball
injured
no
vital
part
we
thought
all
would
be
well
oh
how
sick
i
am
of
theories
and
systems
and
the
pretensions
of
men
there
was
his
son
lying
all
but
dead
and
the
man
was
still
unconvinced
of
the
folly
he
had
been
guilty
of
i
could
hardly
bear
the
sight
of
his
composure
i
shall
hate
the
name
of
science
till
the
day
i
die
give
me
nothing
but
commonplace
unpretending
people
they
were
at
a
wretched
french
cabaret
smelling
vilely
where
we
still
remain
and
the
people
try
as
much
as
they
can
do
to
compensate
for
our
discomforts
by
their
kindness
the
french
poor
people
are
very
considerate
where
they
see
suffering
i
will
say
that
for
them
the
doctors
had
not
allowed
his
poor
lucy
to
go
near
him
she
sat
outside
his
door
and
none
of
us
dared
disturb
her
that
was
a
sight
for
science
his
father
and
myself
and
berry
were
the
only
ones
permitted
to
wait
on
him
and
whenever
we
came
out
there
she
sat
not
speaking
a
word
for
she
had
been
told
it
would
endanger
his
life
but
she
looked
such
awful
eagerness
she
had
the
sort
of
eye
i
fancy
mad
persons
have
i
was
sure
her
reason
was
going
we
did
everything
we
could
think
of
to
comfort
her
a
bed
was
made
up
for
her
and
her
meals
were
brought
to
her
there
of
course
there
was
no
getting
her
to
eat
what
do
you
suppose
his
alarm
was
fixed
on
he
absolutely
said
to
me
but
i
have
not
patience
to
repeat
his
words
he
thought
her
to
blame
for
not
commanding
herself
for
the
sake
of
her
maternal
duties
he
had
absolutely
an
idea
of
insisting
that
she
should
make
an
effort
to
suckle
the
child
i
shall
love
that
berry
to
the
end
of
my
days
i
really
believe
she
has
twice
the
sense
of
any
of
us
science
and
all
she
asked
him
plainly
if
he
wished
to
poison
the
child
and
then
he
gave
way
but
with
a
bad
grace
poor
man
perhaps
i
am
hard
on
him
i
remember
that
you
said
richard
had
done
wrong
yes
well
that
may
be
but
his
father
eclipsed
his
wrong
in
a
greater
wrong
a
crime
or
quite
as
bad
for
if
he
deceived
himself
in
the
belief
that
he
was
acting
righteously
in
separating
husband
and
wife
and
exposing
his
son
as
he
did
i
can
only
say
that
there
are
some
who
are
worse
than
people
who
deliberately
commit
crimes
no
doubt
science
will
benefit
by
it
they
kill
little
animals
for
the
sake
of
science
we
have
with
us
doctor
bairam
and
a
french
physician
from
dieppe
a
very
skilful
man
it
was
he
who
told
us
where
the
real
danger
lay
we
thought
all
would
be
well
a
week
had
passed
and
no
fever
supervened
we
told
richard
that
his
wife
was
coming
to
him
and
he
could
bear
to
hear
it
i
went
to
her
and
began
to
circumlocute
thinking
she
listened
she
had
the
same
eager
look
when
i
told
her
she
might
go
in
with
me
to
see
her
dear
husband
her
features
did
not
change
despres
who
held
her
pulse
at
the
time
told
me
in
a
whisper
it
was
cerebral
fever
brain
fever
coming
on
we
have
talked
of
her
since
i
noticed
that
though
she
did
not
seem
to
understand
me
her
bosom
heaved
and
she
appeared
to
be
trying
to
repress
it
and
choke
something
i
am
sure
now
from
what
i
know
of
her
character
that
she
even
in
the
approaches
of
delirium
was
preventing
herself
from
crying
out
her
last
hold
of
reason
was
a
thought
for
richard
it
was
against
a
creature
like
this
that
we
plotted
i
have
the
comfort
of
knowing
that
i
did
my
share
in
helping
to
destroy
her
had
she
seen
her
husband
a
day
or
two
before
but
no
there
was
a
new
system
to
interdict
that
or
had
she
not
so
violently
controlled
her
nature
as
she
did
i
believe
she
might
have
been
saved
he
said
once
of
a
man
that
his
conscience
was
a
coxcomb
will
you
believe
that
when
he
saw
his
son
wife
poor
victim
lying
delirious
he
could
not
even
then
see
his
error
you
said
he
wished
to
take
providence
out
of
god
hands
his
mad
would
not
leave
him
i
am
positive
that
while
he
was
standing
over
her
he
was
blaming
her
for
not
having
considered
the
child
indeed
he
made
a
remark
to
me
that
it
was
unfortunate
i
think
he
said
that
the
child
should
have
to
be
fed
by
hand
i
dare
say
it
is
all
i
pray
is
that
this
young
child
may
be
saved
from
him
i
can
not
bear
to
see
him
look
on
it
he
does
not
spare
himself
bodily
fatigue
but
what
is
that
that
is
the
vulgarest
form
of
love
i
know
what
you
will
say
you
will
say
i
have
lost
all
charity
and
i
have
but
i
should
not
feel
so
austin
if
i
could
be
quite
sure
that
he
is
an
altered
man
even
now
the
blow
has
struck
him
he
is
reserved
and
simple
in
his
speech
and
his
grief
is
evident
but
i
have
doubts
he
heard
her
while
she
was
senseless
call
him
cruel
and
harsh
and
cry
that
she
had
suffered
and
i
saw
then
his
mouth
contract
as
if
he
had
been
touched
perhaps
when
he
thinks
his
mind
will
be
clearer
but
what
he
has
done
can
not
be
undone
i
do
not
imagine
he
will
abuse
women
any
more
the
doctor
called
her
a
et
belle
jeune
femme
and
he
said
she
was
as
noble
a
soul
as
ever
god
moulded
clay
upon
a
noble
soul
et
belle
she
lies
upstairs
if
he
can
look
on
her
and
not
see
his
sin
i
almost
fear
god
will
never
enlighten
him
she
died
five
days
after
she
had
been
removed
the
shock
had
utterly
deranged
her
i
was
with
her
she
died
very
quietly
breathing
her
last
breath
without
pain
asking
for
no
one
a
death
i
should
like
to
die
her
cries
at
one
time
were
dreadfully
loud
she
screamed
that
she
was
in
fire
and
that
her
husband
would
not
come
to
her
to
save
her
we
deadened
the
sound
as
much
as
we
could
but
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
richard
from
hearing
he
knew
her
voice
and
it
produced
an
effect
like
fever
on
him
whenever
she
called
he
answered
you
could
not
hear
them
without
weeping
berry
sat
with
her
and
i
sat
with
him
and
his
father
moved
from
one
to
the
other
but
the
trial
for
us
came
when
she
was
gone
how
to
communicate
it
to
richard
or
whether
to
do
so
at
all
his
father
consulted
with
us
we
were
quite
decided
that
it
would
be
madness
to
breathe
it
while
he
was
in
that
state
i
can
admit
now
as
things
have
turned
out
we
were
wrong
his
father
left
us
i
believe
he
spent
the
time
in
prayer
and
then
leaning
on
me
he
went
to
richard
and
said
in
so
many
words
that
his
lucy
was
no
more
i
thought
it
must
kill
him
he
listened
and
smiled
i
never
saw
a
smile
so
sweet
and
so
sad
he
said
he
had
seen
her
die
as
if
he
had
passed
through
his
suffering
a
long
time
ago
he
shut
his
eyes
i
could
see
by
the
motion
of
his
eyeballs
up
that
he
was
straining
his
sight
to
some
inner
i
can
not
go
on
i
think
richard
is
safe
had
we
postponed
the
tidings
till
he
came
to
his
clear
senses
it
must
have
killed
him
his
father
was
right
for
once
then
but
if
he
has
saved
his
son
body
he
has
given
the
blow
to
his
heart
richard
will
never
be
what
he
promised
a
letter
found
on
his
clothes
tells
us
the
origin
of
the
quarrel
i
have
had
an
interview
with
lord
this
morning
i
can
not
say
i
think
him
exactly
to
blame
richard
forced
him
to
fight
at
least
i
do
not
select
him
the
foremost
for
blame
he
was
deeply
and
sincerely
affected
by
the
calamity
he
has
caused
alas
he
was
only
an
instrument
your
poor
aunt
is
utterly
prostrate
and
talks
strange
things
of
her
death
she
is
only
happy
in
drudging
bairam
says
we
must
under
any
circumstances
keep
her
employed
whilst
she
is
doing
something
she
can
chat
freely
but
the
moment
her
hands
are
not
occupied
she
gives
me
an
idea
that
she
is
going
into
a
fit
we
expect
the
dear
child
uncle
thompson
is
here
i
have
taken
him
upstairs
to
look
at
her
that
poor
young
man
has
a
true
heart
come
at
once
you
will
not
be
in
time
to
see
her
she
will
lie
at
raynham
if
you
could
you
would
see
an
angel
he
sits
by
her
side
for
hours
i
can
give
you
no
description
of
her
beauty
you
will
not
delay
i
know
dear
austin
and
i
want
you
for
your
presence
will
make
me
more
charitable
than
i
find
it
possible
to
be
have
you
noticed
the
expression
in
the
eyes
of
blind
men
that
is
just
how
richard
looks
as
he
lies
there
silent
in
his
bed
striving
to
image
her
on
his
brain
