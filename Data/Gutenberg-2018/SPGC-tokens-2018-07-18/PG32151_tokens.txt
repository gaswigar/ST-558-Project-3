have

all

are
doubly
my

i
propose
in
the

pages
to
consider
the
possibilities
of
a
satisfactory
intellectual
life
under
various
conditions
of
ordinary
human
existence
it
will
form
a
part
of
my
plan
to
take
into
account
favorable
and
unfavorable
influences
of
many
kinds
and
my
chief
purpose
so
far
as
any
effect
upon
others
may
be
hoped
for
will
be
to
guard
some
who
may
read
the
book
alike
against
the
loss
of
time
caused
by
unnecessary
discouragement
and
the
waste
of
effort
which
is
the
consequence
of
misdirected
energies
i
have
adopted
the
form
of
letters
addressed
to
persons
of
very
different
position
in
order
that
every
reader
may
have
a
chance
of
finding
what
concerns
him
the
letters
it
is
unnecessary
to
observe
are
in
one
sense
as
fictitious
as
those
we
find
in
novels
for
they
have
never
been
sent
to
anybody
by
the
post
yet
the
persons
to
whom
they
are
addressed
are
not
imaginary
i
made
it
a
rule
from
the
beginning
to
think
of
a
real
person
when
writing
from
an
apprehension
that
by
dwelling
in
a
world
too
exclusively
ideal
i
might
lose
sight
of
many
impediments
which
beset
all
actual
lives
even
the
most
exceptional
and
fortunate
the
essence
of
the
book
may
be
expressed
in
a
few
sentences
the
rest
being
little
more
than
evidence
or
illustration
first
it
appears
that
all
who
are
born
with
considerable
intellectual
faculties
are
urged
towards
the
intellectual
life
by
irresistible
instincts
as
are
urged
to
an
aquatic
life
but
the
lower
animals
have
this
advantage
over
man
that
as
their
purposes
are
simpler
so
they
attain
them
more
completely
than
he
does
the
life
of
a
wild
duck
is
in
perfect
accordance
with
its
instincts
but
the
life
of
an
intellectual
man
is
never
on
all
points
perfectly
in
accordance
with
instincts
many
of
the
best
intellectual
lives
known
to
us
have
been
hampered
by
vexatious
impediments
of
the
most
various
and
complicated
kinds
and
when
we
come
to
have
accurate
and
intimate
knowledge
of
the
lives
led
by
our
intellectual
contemporaries
we
are
always
quite
sure
to
find
that
each
of
them
has
some
great
thwarting
difficulty
to
contend
against
nor
is
it
too
much
to
say
that
if
a
man
were
so
placed
and
endowed
in
every
way
that
all
his
work
should
be
made
as
easy
as
the
ignorant
imagine
it
to
be
that
man
would
find
in
that
very
facility
itself
a
condition
most
unfavorable
to
his
intellectual
growth
so
that
however
circumstances
may
help
us
or
hinder
us
the
intellectual
life
is
always
a
contest
or
a
discipline
and
the
art
or
skill
of
living
intellectually
does
not
so
much
consist
in
surrounding
ourselves
with
what
is
reputed
to
be
advantageous
as
in
compelling
every
circumstance
and
condition
of
our
lives
to
yield
us
some
tribute
of
intellectual
benefit
and
force
the
needs
of
the
intellect
are
as
various
as
intellects
themselves
are
various
and
if
a
man
has
got
high
mental
culture
during
his
passage
through
life
it
is
of
little
consequence
where
he
acquired
it
or
how
the
school
of
the
intellectual
man
is
the
place
where
he
happens
to
be
and
his
teachers
are
the
people
books
animals
plants
stones
and
earth
round
about
him
the
feeling
almost
always
predominant
in
the
minds
of
intellectual
men
as
they
grow
older
is
not
so
much
one
of
regret
that
their
opportunities
were
not
more
abundant
as
of
regret
that
they
so
often
missed
opportunities
which
they
might
have
turned
to
better
account
i
have
written
for
all
classes
in
the
conviction
that
the
intellectual
life
is
really
within
the
reach
of
every
one
who
earnestly
desires
it
the
highest
culture
can
never
be
within
the
reach
of
those
who
can
not
give
the
years
of
labor
which
it
costs
and
if
we
cultivate
ourselves
to
shine
in
the
eyes
of
others
to
become
famous
in
literature
or
science
then
of
course
we
must
give
many
more
hours
of
labor
than
can
be
spared
from
a
life
of
practical
industry
but
i
am
fully
convinced
of
this
convinced
by
the
observation
of
living
instances
in
all
classes
that
any
man
or
woman
of
large
natural
capacity
may
reach
the
tone
of
thinking
which
may
justly
be
called
intellectual
even
though
that
thinking
may
not
be
expressed
in
the
most
perfect
language
the
essence
of
intellectual
living
does
not
reside
in
extent
of
science
or
in
perfection
of
expression
but
in
a
constant
preference
for
higher
thoughts
over
lower
thoughts
and
this
preference
may
be
the
habit
of
a
mind
which
has
not
any
very
considerable
amount
of
information
this
may
be
very
easily
demonstrated
by
a
reference
to
men
who
lived
intellectually
in
ages
when
science
had
scarcely
begun
to
exist
and
when
there
was
but
little
literature
that
could
be
of
use
as
an
aid
to
culture
the
humblest
subscriber
to
a
mechanics
institute
has
easier
access
to
sound
learning
than
had
either
solomon
or
aristotle
yet
both
solomon
and
aristotle
lived
the
intellectual
life
whoever
reads
english
is
richer
in
the
aids
to
culture
than
plato
was
yet
plato
intellectually
it
is
not
erudition
that
makes
the
intellectual
man
but
a
sort
of
virtue
which
delights
in
vigorous
and
beautiful
thinking
just
as
moral
virtue
delights
in
vigorous
and
beautiful
conduct
intellectual
living
is
not
so
much
an
accomplishment
as
a
state
or
condition
of
the
mind
in
which
it
seeks
earnestly
for
the
highest
and
purest
truth
it
is
the
continual
exercise
of
a
firmly
noble
choice
between
the
larger
truth
and
the
lesser
between
that
which
is
perfectly
just
and
that
which
falls
a
little
short
of
justice
the
ideal
life
would
be
to
choose
thus
firmly
and
delicately
always
yet
if
we
often
blunder
and
fail
for
want
of
perfect
wisdom
and
clear
light
have
we
not
the
inward
assurance
that
our
aspiration
has
not
been
all
in
vain
that
it
has
brought
us
a
little
nearer
to
the
supreme
intellect
whose
effulgence
draws
us
whilst
it
dazzles
here
is
the
true
secret
of
that
fascination
which
belongs
to
intellectual
pursuits
that
they
reveal
to
us
a
little
more
and
yet
a
little
more
of
the
eternal
order
of
the
universe
establishing
us
so
firmly
in
what
is
known
that
we
acquire
an
unshakable
confidence

govern

is

go

would
be
to
undertake
a
most
difficult
investigation
entirely
beyond
the
competence
of
an
unscientific
person
like
your
present
correspondent
you
will
therefore
permit
me
in
reference
to
this
to
leave
you
to
the
teaching
of
the
most
advanced
physiologists
of
the
time

i
may
be
able
to
offer
a
few
practical
suggestions
based
on
the
experience
of
intellectual
workers
which
may
be
of
use
to
a
man
whose
career
is
likely
to
be
one
of
severe
and
almost
uninterrupted
intellectual
labor
a
paper
was
read
several
years
ago
before
the
members
of
a
society
in
london
in
which
the
author
maintained
that
mental
labor
was
never
injurious
to
a
perfectly
healthy
human
organization
and
that
the
numerous
cases
of
which
are
commonly
attributed
to
excessive
are
due
in
reality
to
the
previous
operation
of
disease
this
is
one
of
those
assertions
which
can
not
be
answered
in
a
sentence
concentrated
within
the
briefest
expression
it
comes
to
this
that
mental
labor
can
not
produce
disease
but
may
aggravate
the
consequences
of
disease
which
already
exists
the
difficulty
of
testing
this
is
obvious
for
so
long
as
health
remains
quite
perfect
it
remains
perfect
of
course
whether
the
brain
is
used
or
not
and
when
failure
of
health
becomes
manifest
it
is
not
always
easy
to
decide
in
what
degree
mental
labor
may
have
been
the
cause
of
it
again
the
accuracy
of
so
general
a
statement
can
not
be
proved
by
any
number
of
instances
in
its
favor
since
it
is
universally
admitted
that
is
not
the
only
cause
of
disease
and
no
one
affirms
that
it
is
more
than
one
amongst
many
causes
which
may
impede
the
bodily
functions
when
the
poet
wordsworth
was
engaged
in
composing
the
white
doe
of
rylstone
he
received
a
wound
in
his
foot
and
he
observed
that
the
continuation
of
the
literary
labor
increased
the
irritation
of
the
wound
whereas
by
suspending
his
work
he
could
diminish
it
and
absolute
mental
rest
produced
a
perfect
cure
in
connection
with
this
incident
he
remarked
that
poetic
excitement
accompanied
by
protracted
labor
in
composition
always
brought
on
more
or
less
of
bodily
derangement
he
preserved
himself
from
permanently
injurious
consequences
by
his
excellent
habits
of
life
a
very
eminent
living
author
whose
name
i
do
not
feel
at
liberty
to
mention
is
always
prostrated
by
severe
illness
at
the
conclusion
of
each
of
his
works
another
is
unwell
every
sunday
because
he
does
not
write
on
that
day
and
the
recoil
after
the
mental
stretch
of
the
week
is
too
much
for
him
in
the
case
of
wordsworth
the
physical
constitution
is
believed
to
have
been
sound
his
health
at
was
excellent
the
two
other
instances
are
more
doubtful
in
this
respect
yet
both
these
writers
enjoy
very
fair
health
after
the
pressure
of
has
been
removed
for
any
considerable
time
a
clergyman
of
robust
organization
who
does
a
good
deal
of
literary
work
at
intervals
told
me
that
whenever
he
had
attempted
to
make
it
regular
the
consequence
had
always
been
distressing
nervous
sensations
from
which
at
other
times
he
was
perfectly
free
a
tradesman
whose
business
affords
an
excellent
outlet
for
energetic
bodily
activity
told
me
that
having
attempted
in
addition
to
his
ordinary
work
to
acquire
a
foreign
language
which
seemed
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
he
had
been
obliged
to
abandon
it
on
account
of
alarming
cerebral
symptoms
this
man
has
immense
vigor
and
energy
but
the
digestive
functions
in
this
instance
are
sluggish
however
when
he
abandoned
study
the
cerebral
inconveniences
disappeared
and
have
never
returned
since
two
londoners
who
followed
literature
as
a
profession
and
who
both
worked
to
excess
had
cerebral
attacks
of
a
still
more
decided
kind
one
of
them
after
his
recovery
resolved
to
regulate
his
work
in
future
so
that
it
might
never
pass
the
limits
of
moderation
he
is
now
living
and
in
possession
of
a
remarkably
clear
and
richly
furnished
intellect
the
other
who
returned
to
his
old
habits
died
in
two
years
from
softening
of
the
brain
i
am
not
aware
that
in
these
cases
there
was
any
other
disease
than
that
produced
by
an
immoderate
use
of
the
mental
powers
the
health
of
sir
walter
scott
we
have
this
on
his
own
testimony
was
uncommonly
robust
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
his
paralysis
was
brought
on
by
the
excessive
labor
which
resulted
from
his
pecuniary
embarrassments
and
that
without
such
excessive
mental
labor
and
anxiety
he
would
have
preserved
his
health
much
longer
the
death
of
byron
was
due
no
doubt
quite
as
much
to
habits
of
dissipation
as
to
poetical
excitement
still
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
borne
either
of
these
evil
influences
if
it
had
not
been
accompanied
by
the
other
and
that
to
a
man
whose
way
of
life
was
so
exhausting
as
was
the
addition
of
constant
poetical
excitement
and
hard
work
in
production
may
be
said
without
exaggeration
to
have
killed
him
we
know
that
scott
with
all
his
facility
had
a
dread
of
that
kind
of
excitement
and
withdrew
from
the
poetical
arena
to
avoid
it
we
know
too
that
the
brain
of
southey
proved
ultimately
unable
to
endure
the
burden
of
the
tasks
he
laid
upon
it
difficult
as
it
may
be
in
some
instances
to
ascertain
quite
accurately
whether
an
overworked
man
had
perfectly
sound
bodily
health
to
begin
with
obvious
as
it
may
be
that
in
many
breakdowns
the
final
failure
has
been
accelerated
by
diseases
independent
of
mental
work
the
facts
remain
that
the
excessive
exercise
of
the
mental
powers
is
injurious
to
bodily
health
and
that
all
intellectual
labor
proceeds
upon
a
physical
basis
no
man
can
safely
forget
this
and
act
as
if
he
were
a
pure
spirit
superior
to
physical
considerations
let
me
then
in
other
letters
on
this
subject
direct
your
attention
to
the
close
connection
which
exists
between
intellectual
production
and
the
state
of
the
body
and
the
brain
not
with
the
authority
of
a
physician
but
with
the
sympathy
of
a
who
has
learned
something
from
his
own
experience
and
still
more
from
the
more
varied
experience

may

than
indirect
results
we
may
suffer
not

from

conditions
it
is
so
sometimes

or
may
be
made
so
by
an
effort
of
will
and
resolution
wordsworth
composed
his
poetry
in
the
open
air
as
he
walked
and
so
preserved
himself
from
the
evil
of
close
confinement
to
the
desk
delane
who
did
so
much
for
the
organization
of
the
newspaper
when
it
was
under
his
management
began
by
doing
law
reports
for
that
paper
in
london
and
on
circuit
his
appearance
of
rude
health
surprised
other
members
of
his
profession
but
he
accounted
for
it
by
the
care
he
took
to
compensate
for
the
bad
air
and
sedentary
labor
in
the
courts
of
law
by
travelling
between
the
assize
towns
on
horseback
and
also
by
a
more
than
commonly
temperate
way
of
life
since
he
carefully
avoided
the
bar
dinners
eating
and
drinking
for
health
alone
it
is
possible
to
endure
the
most
unhealthy
labor
when
there
are
frequent
intervals
of
invigorating
exercise
accompanied
by
habits
of
strict
sobriety
the
plan
so
commonly
resorted
to
of
trying
to
get
health
in
stock
for
the
rest
of
the
year
by
a
fortnight
hurried
travelling
in
the
autumn
is
not
so
good
as
delane
way
of
getting
the
week
supply
of
health
during
the
course
of
the
week
itself
it
happened
once
that
george
sand
was
hurried
by
the
proprietor
of
a
newspaper
who
wanted
one
of
her
novels
as
a
she
has
always
been
a
careful
and
deliberate
worker
very
anxious
to
give
all
necessary
labor
in
preparation
and
like
all
such
conscientious
laborers
she
can
scarcely
endure
to
be
pushed
however
on
this
occasion
she
worked
overtime
as
they
say
in
lancashire
and
to
enable
herself
to
bear
the
extra
pressure
she
did
part
of
the
work
at
night
in
order
to
keep
several
hours
of
daylight
clear
for
her
walks
in
the
country
where
she
lived
many
writers
in
the
same
situation
would
have
temporarily
abandoned
exercise
but
george
sand
clung
to
it
all
the
more
at
a
time
when
it
was
especially
necessary
that
she
should
be
well
in
the
same
way
sir
walter
scott
counterbalanced
the
effects
of
sedentary
occupation
by
his
hearty
enjoyment
of
it
has
been
supposed
that
his
outdoor
exercise
which
to
weaker
persons
appears
excessive
may
have
helped
to
bring
on
the
stroke
of
paralysis
which
finally
disabled
him
but
the
fact
is
that
when
the
stroke
arrived
sir
walter
had
altered
his
habits
of
life
in
obedience
to
what
he
believed
to
be
his
duty
and
had
abandoned
or
nearly
so
the
active
amusements
of
his
happier
years
i
believe
rather
that
whilst
he
took
so
much
exercise
his
robust
constitution
not
only
enabled
him
to
endure
it
without
injury
but
required
it
to
keep
the
nervous
system
healthy
in
spite
of
his
hard
work
in
literary
composition
physical
exercise
when
the
constitution
is
strong
enough
to
endure
it
is
by
far
the
best
tranquillizer
of
the
nervous
system
which
has
yet
been
discovered
and
sir
walter
life
at
abbotsford
was
in
this
respect
at
least
grounded
on
the
true
philosophy
of
conduct
the
french
romancer
eugene
sue
wrote
till
ten
every
morning
and
passed
the
rest
of
the
day
when
at
his
country
house
either
in
or
or
gardening
for
all
of
which
he
had
a
liking
which
amounted
to
passion
delight
was
boating
which
at
once
exercised
his
muscles
and
relieved
his
mind
from
the
weariness
of
incessant
invention
or
speculation
it
will
generally
be
found
that
whenever
a
man
of
much
intellectual
distinction
has
maintained
his
powers
in
full
activity
it
has
been
by
avoiding
the
bad
effects
of
an
entirely
sedentary
life
i
well
believe
that
a
person
naturally
robust
with
a
clear
and
powerful
brain
could
bear
twelve
or
fourteen
hours
work
every
day
for
years
together
so
far
as
the
work
itself
is
concerned
if
only
so
large
an
expenditure
of
time
left
a
sufficient
margin
for
amusement
and
exercise
and
sleep
but
the
privation
of
exercise
by
weakening
the
digestive
and
assimilative
powers
reduces
the
flow
of
healthy
and
rich
blood
to
the
brain
the
brain
requires
an
enormous
quantity
of
blood
especially
when
the
cerebral
matter
is
rapidly
destroyed
by
intellectual
labor
and
usually
brings
on
nervousness
the
peculiar
affliction
of
the
mental
laborer
this
nervousness
is
nature
kindly
warning
preserving
us
if
we
attend
to
it
in
time
from
much
more
serious
consequences
the
best
preventive
of
it
and
often
the
only
cure
is
plenty
of
moderate
exercise
the
customs
of
the
upper
classes
in
england
happily
provide
this
in
the
best
shape
that
of
amusement
enjoyed
in
society
but
our
middle
classes
in
large
towns
do
not
get
nearly
enough
of
it
and
the
most
studious
are
always
strongly
tempted
to
neglect
it
altogether
men
of
great
imaginative
power
are
commonly
addicted
to
a
habit
which
is
peculiarly
dangerous
they
work
as
work
with
the
utmost
intensity
of
effort
during
short
spaces
of
time
taxing
all
their
powers
whilst
the
brilliant
effort
lasts
when
beckford
wrote
the
wonderful
tale
vathek
in
his
twentieth
year
he
did
it
at
a
single
sitting
which
lasted
for
three
days
and
two
nights
and
it
cost
him
a
serious
illness
several
of
the
best
poems
by
byron
were
written
if
not
quite
with
equal
rapidity
still
on
the
same
principle
of
composition
at
white
heat
in
cases
of
this
kind
nature
provides
her
own
remedy
in
the
indolence
of
the
imaginative
temperament
which
leaves
large
spaces
of
time
for
the
action
of
the
recuperative
processes
the
same
law
governs
the
physical
energies
of
the
carnivora
which
maintain
or
recover
their
capacity
for
extraordinary
effort
by
intervals
of
absolute
repose
in
its
long
spaces
of
mental
rest
the
imaginative
temperament
recruits
itself
by
amusement
which
in
england
usually
includes
physical
exercise
of
some
kind
this
fortunate
indolence
of
men
of
genius
would
in
most
instances
ensure
their
safety
if
they
were
not
impelled
by
necessity
to
labor
beyond
the
suggestions
of
inclination
the
exhausted
brain
never
of
itself
seeks
the
additional
exhaustion
of
hard
work
you
know
very
well
when
you
are
tired
and
at
such
times
the
natural
man
in
you
asks
plainly
enough
for
rest
and
recreation
the
art
is
so
to
arrange
our
lives
that
the
natural
man
may
sometimes
have
his
way
and
forget
if
only
for
a
time
the
labors
which
lead
to
weariness
not
to
that
pleasant
weariness
of
the
body
which
promises
soundest
sleep
but
the
distressing
fatigue
of
the
exhausted
spirit
which
is
tortured
by
the
importunity
of
ideas
which
it
is
unable
to
express
and
apprehensions
that
it
can
not
dismiss
which
fights
through
the
sleepless
night
the
phantoms
of
unconquerable
horror
the
bad
effect
of
literary
composition
on
the
physical
state
which
was
observed
by
wordsworth
in
his
own
case
was
also
noticed
by
shelley
during
the
composition
of
the
cenci
which
he
said
had
been
a
fine
antidote
to
nervous
medicines
and
kept
he
believed
the
pain
in
his
side
as
sticks
do
a
fire
these
influences
are
best
observed
in
people
whose
health
is
delicate
although
joubert
for
example
had
an
extremely
clear
intellect
he
could
scarcely
write
at
all
on
account
of
the
physical
consequences
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
literary
work
simply
as
a
strong
in
moderate
quantities
it
is
not
only
innocent
but
decidedly
beneficial
in
excess
it
acts
like
poison
on
the
nervous
system
what
constitutes
excess
every
man
has
to
find
out
by
his
own
experience
a

acquired

of
folding

by
passing

over
and

so
that
when

operation

was

i
am
there
is
nothing
in

lives
of
philosophers
more
satisfactory
than
this
little
passage
if
kant
had
said
to
himself
can
anybody
be
wiser
more
learned
more
justly
deserving
of
immortal
fame
than
i
am
we
should
have
felt
that
however
agreeable
this
opinion
might
have
been
to
the
philosopher
who
held
it
his
private
satisfaction
stood
in
need
of
confirmation
from
without
and
even
if
he
had
really
been
all
this
we
might
have
reflected
that
wisdom
and
learning
still
leave
their
possessor
exposed
to
the
acutest
kinds
of
suffering
but
when
a
philosopher
rolls
himself
up
at
night
and
congratulates
himself
on
the
possession
of
perfect
health
we
only
think
what
a
happy
man
he
was
to
possess
that
first
of
blessings
and
what
a
sensible
man
to
know
the
value
of
it
and
kant
had
a
deeper
happiness
in
this
reflection
than
any
which
could
spring
from
the
mere
consciousness
of
possessing
one
of
the
unearned
gifts
of
nature
the
excellence
of
his
health
was
due
in
part
to
a
sufficiently
good
constitution
but
it
was
due
also
to
his
own
extreme
carefulness
about
his
habits
by
an
unceasing
observation
of
his
own
bodily
life
as
far
as
possible
removed
from
the
anxiety
of
hypochondriacs
he
managed
to
keep
the
physical
machine
in
such
regular
order
that
for
more
than
thirty
years
he
always
rose
precisely
at
the
same
minute
if
his
object
had
been
health
for
health
sake
the
result
would
still
have
been
well
worth
any
sacrifices
of
momentary
inclination
that
it
cost
him
but
kant
had
a
higher
purpose
he
well
knew
that
the
regularity
of
the
intellectual
life
depended
entirely
on
the
regularity
of
the
bodily
functions
and
unlike
the
foolish
men
alluded
to
by
goethe
who
pass
the
day
in
complaining
of
headache
and
the
night
in
drinking
the
wine
that
produces
it
kant
not
only
knew
that
regular
health
was
necessary
to
his
work
as
a
philosopher
but
did
everything
in
his
power
to
preserve
it
few
intellectual
laborers
have
in
this
respect
given
evidence
of
such
persistent
strength
of
will
in
his
manner
of
living
he
did
not
consult
custom
but
the
needs
of
his
individual
nature
it
is
not
always
easy
for
great
to
follow
with
perfect
fidelity
the
customs
of
the
people
about
them
these
usages
have
been
gradually
formed
by
the
majority
to
suit
the
needs
of
the
majority
but
there
are
cases
where
a
close
adherence
to
them
would
be
a
serious
hindrance
to
the
highest
and
best
activity
a
good
example
of
this
is
kant
intense
antipathy
to
beer
it
did
not
suit
him
and
he
was
right
in
his
to
german
usage
on
this
point
but
he
was
mistaken
in
believing
beer
to
be
universally
injurious
there
is
a
very
general
belief
in
england
that
what
is
called
a
good
breakfast
is
the
foundation
of
the
labor
of
the
day
kant
breakfast
which
he
took
at
five
in
the
morning
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
consisted
of
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
pipe
of
tobacco
on
this
he
worked
eight
hours
either
in
lecturing
or
writing
a
long
stretch
of
uninterrupted
labor
he
dined
at
one
and
this
was
his
only
meal
for
he
had
no
supper
the
single
repast
was
a
deviation
from
ordinary
usage
but
kant
found
that
it
suited
him
probably
because
he
read
in
the
evening
from
six
till
a
quarter
to
ten
and
a
second
meal
might
have
interfered
with
this
by
diminishing
his
power
of
attention
there
exists
a
strong
medical
objection
to
this
habit
of
taking
only
one
meal
in
hours
which
indeed
is
almost
unknown
in
england
though
not
extremely
rare
on
the
continent
i
know
an
old
gentleman
who
for
forty
years
has
lived
as
kant
did
and
enjoys
excellent
health
and
uncommon
mental
clearness
a
detail
which
illustrates
kant
attention
to
whatever
could
affect
his
physical
life
is
his
rule
to
withdraw
his
mind
from
everything
requiring
effort
fifteen
minutes
before
he
went
to
bed
his
theory
which
is
fully
confirmed
by
the
experience
of
others
was
that
there
was
a
risk
of
missing
sleep
if
the
brain
was
not
tranquillized
before
he
knew
that
the
intellectual
life
of
the
day
depended
on
the
night
rest
and
he
took
this
precaution
to
secure
it
the
regularity
of
his
daily
walk
taken
during
the
afternoon
in
all
weathers
and
the
strict
limitation
of
the
hours
of
rest
also
helped
the
soundness
of
his
sleep
he
would
not
walk
out
in
company
for
the
whimsical
reason
that
if
he
opened
his
mouth
a
colder
air
would
reach
his
lungs
than
that
which
passed
through
the
nostrils
and
he
would
not
eat
alone
but
always
had
guests
to
dinner
there
are
good
physiological
reasons
in
favor
of
pleasant
society
at
table
and
besides
these
there
are
good
intellectual
reasons
also
by
attention
to
these
rules
of
his
kant
managed
to
keep
both
body
and
mind
in
a
working
order
more
uninterrupted
than
is
usual
with
men
who
go
through
much
intellectual
labor
the
solitary
objection
to
his
system
is
the
excessive
regularity
of
habit
to
which
it
bound
him
by
chains
of
his
own
forging
he
found
a
quiet
happiness
in
this
regularity
indeed
happiness
is
said
to
be
more
commonly
found
in
habit
that
in
anything
else
so
deeply
does
it
satisfy
a
great
permanent
instinct
of
our
nature
but
a
regularity
of
habit
is
objectionable
because
it
can
only
be
practicable
at
home
and
is
compatible
only
with
an
existence
of
the
most
absolute
tranquillity
kant
did
not
travel
and
never
could
have
travelled
he
was
a
bachelor
and
could
not
have
ceased
to
be
a
bachelor
without
a
disturbance
that
would
have
been
intolerable
to
him
he
enjoyed
the
full
benefits
of
his
system
without
experiencing
its
disadvantages
but
any
considerable
change
of
situation
would
have
made
the
disadvantages
apparent
few
lives
can
be
so
minutely
regulated
without
risk
of
future
inconvenience
kant
example
is
a
good
one
so
far
as
this
that
it
proved
a
sort
of
independence
of
character
which
would
be
valuable
to
every
student
all
who
need
to
keep
their
minds
in
the
best
possible
condition
ought
to
have
resolution
enough
to
regulate
their
living
in
a
manner
which
experience
in
their
case
proves
to
be
most
favorable
whatever
may
be
the
authority
of
custom
a
wise
man
makes
himself
independent
of
usages
which
are
impediments
to
his
best
activity
i
know
an
author
who
was
always
unwell
about
eleven
in
the
morning
so
unwell
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
lament
his
miserable
fate
knowing
by
experience
the
powerful
effect
of
regimen
i
inquired
whether
he
enjoyed
his
breakfast
no
he
did
not
then
why
did
he
attempt
to
eat
any
breakfast
it
turned
out
that
this
foolish
man
swallowed
every
morning
two
cups
of
bad
coffee
and
a
quantity
of
greasy
food
from
a
patriotic
deference
to
the
customs
of
his
country
he
was
persuaded
to
abandon
this
unsuitable
habit
and
to
eat
nothing
till
ten
when
his
adviser
prescribed
a
little
à
la
accompanied
by
half
a
bottle
of
sound
bordeaux
the
effect
was
magical
my
friend
felt
light
and
cheerful
before
and
worked
quite
happily
and
well
whilst
after
he
felt
like
a
horse
that
has
eaten
his
corn
nor
was
the
good
effect
a
transitory
one
the
bad
symptoms
never
returned
and
he
still
adheres
to
his
new
arrangement
this
little
reform
made
a
wretched
existence
happy
and
has
had
for
its
result
an
increase
in
production
with
a
diminution
of
fatigue
the
explanation
is
that
the
stomach
did
not
ask
for
the
early
breakfast
and
had
a
hard
fight
to
overcome
it
after
which
came
exhaustion
and
a
distaste
both
for
food
and
work
there
are
cases
where
an
opposite
rule
is
the
right
one
an
englishman
living
in
paris
found
the
french
unsuitable
for
him
and
discovered
that
he
worked
best
on
a
substantial
english
breakfast
with
strong
tea
at
eight
in
the
morning
after
which
he
went
on
working
all
day
without
any
further
nourishment
till
dinner
at
six
in
the
evening
a
friend
of
sir
walter
scott
who
had
stayed
with
him
at
abbotsford
told
me
that
sir
walter
ate
and
drank
like
everybody
else
as
to
times
and
seasons
but
much
more
abundantly
than
people
of
less
vigorous
organization
goethe
used
to
work
till
eleven
without
taking
anything
then
he
drank
a
cup
of
chocolate
and
worked
till
one
at
two
he
dined
this
meal
was
the
important
meal
of
the
day
his
appetite
was
immense
even
on
the
days
when
he
complained
of
not
being
hungry
he
ate
much
more
than
most
men
puddings
sweets
and
cakes
were
always
welcome
he
sat
a
long
while
over
his
wine
he
was
fond
of
wine
and
drank
daily
his
two
or
three
bottles
an
eminent
french
publisher
one
of
the
most
and
men
of
his
generation
never
touched
food
or
drink
till
six
in
the
evening
when
he
ate
an
excellent
dinner
with
his
guests
he
found
this
system
favorable
to
his
work
but
a
man
of
less
robust
constitution
would
have
felt
exhausted
in
the
course
of
the
day
turgot
could
not
work
well
till
after
he
had
dined
copiously
but
many
men
can
not
think
after
a
substantial
meal
and
here
in
spite
of
the
example
set
by
scott
and
goethe
let
me
observe
that
nothing
interferes
so
much
with
brainwork
as
the
intellectual
workman
requires
nourishment
of
the
best
possible
quality
but
the
quantity
ought
always
to
be
well
within
the
capacity
of
his
digestive
powers
the
truth
appears
to
be
that
whilst
the
intellectual
life
makes
very
large
demands
upon
nutrition
for
cerebral
activity
can
not
go
forward
without
constant
supplies
of
force
which
must
come
ultimately
from
what
we
have
eaten
this
kind
of
life
being
sedentary
is
unfavorable
to
the
work
of
digestion
can
not
eat
like
sportsmen
and
farmers
without
losing
many
hours
in
torpor
and
yet
they
need
nutrition
as
much
as
if
they
led
active
lives
the
only
way
out
of
this
difficulty
is
to
take
care
that
the
food
is
good
enough
for
a
moderate
quantity
of
it
to
maintain
the
physical
and
mental
powers
the
importance
of
scientific
cookery
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
intellectual
labor
is
in
its
origin
as
dependent
upon
the
art
of
cookery
as
the
dissemination
of
its
results
is
dependent
upon
and
printing
this
is
one
of
those
matters
which
people
can
not
be
brought
to
consider
seriously
but
cookery
in
its
perfection
the
great
science
of
preparing
food
in
the
way
best
suited
to
our
use
is
really
the
most
important
of
all
sciences
and
the
mother
of
the
arts
the
wonderful
theory
that
the
most
ignorant
cookery
is
the
most
favorable
to
health
is
only
fit
for
the
dark
ages
it
is
grossly
and
stupidly
untrue
a
scientific
cook
will
keep
you
in
regular
health
when
an
ignorant
one
will
offer
you
the
daily
alternative
of
starving
or
indigestion
the
great
question
of
drinks
is
scarcely
less
important
sound
natural
wines
not
strengthened
by
any
addition
of
alcohol
are
known
to
supply
both
stimulus
and
nourishment
to
the
brain
goethe
practice
was
not
irrational
though
he
drank
fifty
thousand
bottles
in
his
lifetime
still
it
is
not
necessary
to
imitate
him
to
this
extent
the
populations
have
keener
and
livelier
wits
than
those
who
use
other
beverages
it
is
proved
by
long
experience
that
the
pure
juice
of
the
grape
sustains
the
force
and
activity
of
the
brain
the
poets
who
from
age
to
age
have
sung
the
praise
of
wine
were
not
wholly
either
deceivers
or
deceived
in
the
lands
of
the
vine
where
the
plant
is
looked
upon
as
a
nursing
mother
men
do
not
injure
their
health
by
drinking
but
in
the
colder
north
where
the
grape
can
never
ripen
the
deaths
from
intemperance
are
frequent
bread
and
wine
are
almost
pure
gifts
of
nature
though
both
are
prepared
by
man
after
the
old
traditional
ways
these
are
not
poisons
but
gin
and
absinthe
are
poisons
madness
poured
out
from
a
bottle
kant
and
goethe
loved
the
pure
rhine
wine
and
their
brains
were
clear
and
vigorous
to
the
utmost
span
of
life
it
was
not
wine
that
ruined
burns
and
byron
or
baudelaire
or
alfred
de
musset
notwithstanding
kant
horror
of
beer
that
honest
northern
drink
deserves
our
friendly
recognition
it
has
quite
a
peculiar
effect
upon
the
nervous
system
giving
a
rest
and
calm
which
no
other
drink
can
procure
for
it
so
safely
it
is
said
that
beer
drinkers
are
slow
and
a
little
stupid
that
they
have
an
placidity
not
quite
favorable
to
any
brilliant
intellectual
display
but
there
are
times
when
this
placidity
is
what
the
laboring
brain
most
needs
after
the
agitations
of
too
active
thinking
there
is
safety
in
a
tankard
of
ale
the
wine
drinkers
are
agile
but
they
are
excitable
the
beer
drinkers
are
heavy
but
in
their
heaviness
there
is
peace
in
that
clear
golden
drink
which
england
has
brewed
for
more
than
a
thousand
octobers
and
will
brew
for
a
thousand
more
we
may
find
perhaps
some
explanation
of
that
absence
of
irritability
which
is
the
of
the
national
character
which
makes
it
faithful
in
its
affections
easy
to
govern
not
easy
to
excite
to
violence
if
i
have
spoken
favorably
of
beer
and
wine
as
having
certain
intellectual
uses
please
remember
that
i
recommend
only
the
habitual
use
of
them
not
mad
rites
of
bacchus
and
even
the
habitual
use
only
just
so
far
as
it
may
suit
the
individual
constitution
the
liberal
regimen
of
scott
and
goethe
would
not
answer
in
every
case
and
there
are
organizations
often
very
robust
in
which
intoxicating
drinks
of
all
kinds
even
in
the
most
moderate
quantity
impede
the
brain
action
instead
of
aiding
it
two
of
the
most
able
men
i
have
ever
known
could
not
drink
pure
wine
of
any
kind
because
it
sent
the
blood
to
the
head
with
consequent
cerebral
oppression
and
whilst
on
this
subject
i
ought
to
observe
that
the
aid
which
these
stimulants
afford
even
when
the
body
gratefully
accepts
them
is
often
treacherous
from
its
very
acceptability
men
who
are
and
the
number
of
such
men
is
unhappily
very
great
in
these
days
say
that
without
stimulants
they
could
not
get
through
their
labor
but
the
stimulants
often
delude
us
as
to
the
limits
of
our
natural
powers
and
encourage
us
to
attempt
too
much
the
help
they
give
us
is
not
altogether
illusory
under
certain
limitations
it
is
real
but
many
have
gone
farther
than
the
reality
of
the
assistance
warranted
the
ally
brings
to
us
an
increase
of
forces
but
he
comes
with
appearances
of
power
surpassing
the
reality
and
we
undertake
tasks
beyond
our
strength
in
drinking
as
in
eating
the
best
rule
for
the
intellectual
is
moderation
in
quantity
with
good
quality
a
sound
wine
and
not
enough
of
it
to
foster
the
use
of
tobacco
has
so
much
extended
itself
in
the
present
generation
that
we
are
all
obliged
to
make
a
decision
for
ourselves
on
the
ancient
controversy
between
its
friends
and
enemies
we
can
not
form
a
reasonable
opinion
about
tobacco
without
bearing
in
mind
that
it
produces
according
to
circumstances
one
of
two
entirely
distinct
and
even
opposite
classes
of
effects
in
certain
states
of
the
body
it
acts
as
a
stimulant
in
other
states
as
a
narcotic
people
who
have
a
dislike
to
smoking
affirm
that
it
stupefies
but
this
assertion
at
least
so
far
as
the
temporary
consequences
are
concerned
is
not
supported
by
experience
most
of
the
really
brilliant
conversations
that
i
have
listened
to
have
been
accompanied
by
clouds
of
and
a
great
deal
of
the
best
literary
composition
that
is
produced
by
contemporary
authors
is
wrought
by
men
who
are
actually
smoking
whilst
they
work
my
own
experience
is
that
very
moderate
smoking
acts
as
a
pleasant
stimulus
upon
the
brain
whilst
it
produces
a
temporary
lassitude
of
the
muscular
system
not
perceptible
in
times
of
rest
but
an
appreciable
hindrance
in
times
of
muscular
exertion
it
is
better
therefore
for
men
who
feel
these
effects
from
tobacco
to
avoid
it
when
they
are
in
exercise
and
to
use
it
only
when
the
body
rests
and
the
mind
labors
pray
remember
however
that
this
is
the
experience
of
an
exceedingly
moderate
smoker
who
has
not
yet
got
himself
into
the
general
condition
of
body
which
is
brought
on
by
a
larger
indulgence
in
tobacco
on
the
other
hand
it
is
evident
that
men
engaged
in
physical
labor
find
a
muscular
stimulus
in
occasional
smoking
and
not
a
temporary
lassitude
it
is
probable
that
the
effect
varies
with
individual
cases
and
is
never
precisely
what
our
own
experience
would
lead
us
to
imagine
for
excessive
smokers
it
appears
to
be
little
more
than
the
tranquillizing
of
a
sort
of
uneasiness
the
continual
satisfaction
of
a
continual
craving
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
that
moderate
smoking
diminished
intellectual
force
but
i
have
observed
in
excessive
smokers
a
decided
weakening
of
the
will
and
a
preference
for
talking
about
work
to
the
effort
of
actual
labor
the
opinions
of
medical
men
on
this
subject
are
so
much
at
variance
that
their
science
only
adds
to
our
uncertainty
one
doctor
tells
me
that
the
most
moderate
smoking
is
unquestionably
injurious
whilst
others
affirm
that
it
is
innocent
speaking
simply
from
i
find
that
in
my
own
case
tea
and
coffee
are
far
more
perilous
than
tobacco
almost
all
english
people
are
habitual
and
as
the
tea
they
drink
is
very
strong
they
may
be
said
to
use
it
in
excess
the
unpleasant
symptoms
which
produces
in
a
patient
not
inured
by
habit
disappear
in
the
seasoned
leaving
only
a
certain
exhilaration
which
appears
to
be
perfectly
innocuous
if
tea
is
a
safe
stimulant
it
is
certainly
an
agreeable
one
and
there
seems
to
be
no
valid
reason
why
should
refuse
themselves
that
solace
i
knew
a
worthy
clergyman
many
years
ago
who
from
the
most
conscientious
motives
denied
himself
ale
and
wine
but
found
a
fountain
of
consolation
in
the
his
usual
allowance
was
sixteen
cups
all
of
heroic
strength
and
the
effect
upon
his
brain
seems
to
have
been
altogether
favorable
for
his
sermons
were
both
long
and
eloquent
and
to
this
day
he
is
preaching
still
without
any
diminution
of
his
powers
french
people
find
in
coffee
the

whilst

the
best
proof
that
tea
and
coffee
are
favorable
to
intellectual
expression
is
that
all
nations
use
one
or
the
other
as
aids

any

that
it

the
perfect

the
wisdom
of
occasionally
using
these
various
stimulants
for
intellectual
purposes
is
proved
by
a
single
consideration
each
of
us
has
a
little
cleverness
and
a
great
deal
of
sluggish
stupidity
there
are
certain
occasions
when
we
absolutely
need
the
little
cleverness
that
we
possess
the
orator
needs
it
when
he
speaks
the
poet
when
he
versifies
but
neither
cares
how
stupid
he
may
become
when
the
oration
is
delivered
and
the
lyric
set
down
on
paper
the
stimulant
serves
to
bring
out
the
talent
when
it
is
wanted
like
the
wind
in
the
pipes
of
an
organ
what
will
it
matter
if
i
am
even
a
little
duller
afterwards
says
the
genius
i
can
afford
to
be
dull
when
i
have
done
but
the
truth
still
remains
that
there
are
stimulants
and
stimulants
not
the
nectar
of
the
gods
themselves
were
worth
the
dash
of
a
wave
upon
the
beach
and
the
pure
cool
air
of
the
morning
what
is
said
in
the
above
letter
about
the
employment
of
stimulants
is
intended
to
apply
only
to
cases
in
which
there
is
no
organic
disease
the
harm
which
diseased
persons
do
to
themselves
by
conforming
to
customs
which
are
innocent
for
others
is
as
lamentable
as
it
is
easily
avoidable
two

a

i
know
two
little
boys
sons
of
a
near
neighbor
who
have
from
childhood
exhibited
opposite
tendencies
one
of
them
is
incessantly
active
always
out
of
doors
in
any
weather
busy
about
horses
and
farming
and
game
heedless
of
his
books
and
studying
only
under
positive
compulsion
the
other
sits
at
home
with
his
lessons
or
a
story
book
and
only
goes
out
because
he
is
incited
by
the
fraternal
example
the
two
lads
represent
two
distinct
varieties
of
human
life
the
active
and
the
intellectual
the
elder
is
happiest
during
physical
exertion
the
younger
is
happiest
when
his
brain
is
fully
occupied
left
entirely
to
themselves
without
the
equalizing
influence
of
the
outside
world
and
the
ways
of
living
which
general
custom
has
established
they
would
lead
the
most
opposite
lives
the
elder
would
inevitably
become
a
farmer
that
he
might
live
in
the
country
and
take
exercise
all
day
long
or
else
he
would
seek
adventure
in
wild
travel
or
in
romantic
warfare
but
the
younger
would
very
quickly
be
taken
possession
of
by
some
engrossing
intellectual
pursuit
and
lead
the
life
of
a
sedentary
student
the
problem
which
these
two
young
lives
have
before
them
is
the
reconciliation
of
their
tendencies
since
they
come
of
cultivated
parents
the
intellectual
lad
has
the
better
chance
of
following
his
own
bent
both
will
have
to
take
their
university
degrees
and
the
younger
has
the
advantage
there
still
there
are
powerful
influences
in
favor
of
the
elder
his
activity
will
be
encouraged
by
the
admiration
of
his
companions
and
by
the
example
of
the
country
gentlemen
who
are
his
neighbors
he
can
ride
and
row
and
swim
he
is
beginning
to
shoot
at
twenty
he
will
be
a
sportsman
when
once
he
has
taken
his
degree
i
wonder
what
will
be
the
advances
in
his
intellectual
culture
fraternal
and
social
influences
will
preserve
the
younger
from
absolute
physical
inaction
but
there
are
not
any
influences
powerful
enough
to
keep
the
elder
safe
from
intellectual
rust
if
you
who
are
a
distinguished
sportsman
and
athlete
would
kindly
inform
us
with
perfect
frankness
of
the
line
which
your
studies
have
followed
since
you
quitted
eton
we
should
be
the
wiser
for
your
experience
have
gymnastic
exercises
hardened
you
as
plato
said
they
did
when
pursued
excessively
and
do
you
need
the
musical
studies
which
he
both
valued
and
dreaded
as
the
most
powerful
of
softening
influences
if
you
have
energy
enough
to
lead
both
lives
pray
how
do
you
find
the
time
as
to
plato
musical
influence
you
invite
it
and
yet
you
treacherously
elude
its
power
after
being
out
all
day
in
the
pursuit
of
sylvan
pleasures
if
shooting
on
treeless
wastes
can
be
called
a
sylvan
pleasure
you
come
home
at
nightfall
ravenous
then
you
do
ample
justice
to
your
dinner
and
having
satisfied
your
de
you
go
into
the
and
ask
your
wife
to
play
and
sing
to
you
if
plato
could
witness
that
pretty
scene
he
would
approve
your
obedience
to
his
counsels
he
would
behold
an
athletic
englishman
stretching
his
mighty
limbs
on
a
couch
of
soft
repose
and
letting
his
soul
grow
tender
as
his
ears
drank
ravishing
harmonies
if
however
the
ancient
sage
delighted
with
so
sweet
a
picture
of
strength
refined
by
song
were
to
dwell
upon
the
sight
as
i
have
done
he
would
perceive
too
soon
that
although
your
body
was
present
indeed
your
soul
had
become
deaf
in
sleep
oblivion
so
it
happens
to
you
night
after
night
and
the
music
reaches
you
no
more
than
the
songs
of
choristers
reach
the
dead
in
the
graves
below
and
the
elevating
influences
of
literature
you
have
books
of
course
in
abundance
there
is
a
library
amongst
other
luxuries
of
your
home
but
the
literature
your
intellect
feeds
upon
is
in
the
columns
of
the
your
newspaper
yet
this
neglect
of
the
means
of
culture
is
not
due
to
any
natural
feebleness
of
the
mind
your
brain
by
its
nature
is
as
vigorous
as
your
vigorous
body
it
is
sleep
and
weariness
and
the
great
necessary
business
of
digestion
that
drown
your
intellectual
energies
the
work
of
repairing
so
great
a
destruction
of
muscle
is
nature
chief
concern
since
you
became
the
mighty
hunter
that
you
are
the
wear
and
tear
have
been
enormous
and
the
necessary
rapidity
of
reconstruction
has
absorbed
your
rich
vitality
i
will
not
question
the
wisdom
of
your
choice
if
there
has
been
any
deliberate
choice
though
perhaps
the
life
of
action
that
you
lead
may
have
grown
rather
out
of
circumstances
determining
habit
than
from
any
conscious
resolution
health
is
so
much
more
necessary
to
happiness
than
culture
that
few
who
could
choose
between
them
would
sacrifice
it
for
learning
unless
they
were
impelled
by
irresistible
instincts
and
beyond
the
great
delight
of
health
and
strength
there
is
a
restlessness
in
men
born
to
be
active
which
must
have
its
outlet
in
activity
i
knew
a
brave
italian
who
had
followed
garibaldi
in
all
his
romantic
enterprises
who
had
suffered
from
privation
and
from
wounds
who
had
not
only
faced
death
in
the
wildest
adventures
but
what
is
even
more
terrible
to
the
active
temperament
had
risked
health
from
frequent
exposure
and
when
i
asked
him
whether
it
was
affection
to
his
famous
chief
or
faith
in
a
political
creed
or
some
more
personal
motive
that
had
led
him
to
this
scorn
of
prudence
he
answered
that
after
honest
he
believed
the
most
powerful
motive
to
be
the
passion
for
an
active
life
the
active
temperament
likes
physical
action
for
its
own
sake
and
not
as
a
means
of
health
activity
renews
itself
and
claims
larger
and
larger
satisfaction
till
at
last
the
habit
of
it
absorbs
the
whole
energy
of
the
man
although
such
a
life
as
yours
would
be
incompatible
with
the
work
i
have
to
do
it
would
be
an
unmixed
benefit
to
me
to
take
a
greater
interest
in
exercise
if
you
could
but
communicate
that
interest
how
willingly
would
i
become
your
pupil
the
fatal
law
of
the
studious
temperament
is
that
in
exercise
itself
it
must
find
some
intellectual
charm
so
that
we
quit
our
books
in
the
library
only
to
go
and
read
the
infinite
book
of
nature
we
can
not
go
out
in
the
country
without
incessantly
thinking
about
either
botany
or
geology
or
landscape
painting
and
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
find
a
refuge
from
the
importunate
habit
of
investigation
sport
is
the
only
refuge
but
the
difficulty
is
to
care
about
it
sufficiently
to
avoid
when
you
have
not
the
natural
instinct
how
are
you
to
supply
its
place
by
any
excitement
there
is
no
position
in
the
world
more
wearisome
than
that
of
a
man
inwardly
indifferent
to
the
amusement
in
which
he
is
trying
to
take
part
can
watch
for
game
with
an
invincible
patience
for
you
have
the
natural
instinct
but
after
the
first
ten
minutes
on
the
skirts
of
the
wood
i
lay
my
gun
down
and
begin
to
botanize
last
week
a
friendly
neighbor
invited
me
to
a
the
boar
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
middle
of
a
great
impenetrable
plantation
and
all
i
did
during
the
whole
morning
was
to
sit
in
my
saddle
awaiting
the
exit
of
the
beast
cantering
from
one
point
of
the
wood
circumference
to
another
as
the
cry
of
the
dogs
guided
me
was
it
pleasure
a
true
hunter
would
have
found
interest
enough
in
expectation
but
i
felt
like
a
man
on
a

is
waiting

in

remind

tell
us
in

not

be

to
amend
the
error
of
our
ways
our
digestion
is
sluggish
and
imperfect
we
are
as

as
delicate

and
there
is
no

in

how
easy
it
is
to
follow

of
the
two
lives
the
animal
or

intellectual
how
difficult
to
conciliate
the
two
in
every
one
of
us
there
exists
an
animal
which
might
have
been
as
vigorous
as
wolves
and
foxes
if
it
had
been
left
to
develop
itself
in
freedom
but
besides
the
animal
there
existed
also
a
mind
and
the
mental
activity
restrained
the
bodily
activity
till
at
last
there
is
a
serious
danger
of
putting
an
end
to
it
altogether
i
know
two
men
about
years
old
both
of
them
and
both
of
them
admirably
active
they
tell
me
that
their
bodily
activity
has
been
preserved
by
an
effort
of
the
will
that
if
they
had
not
resolutely
kept
up
the
habit
of
using
legs
and
arms
in
daily
work
or
amusement
their
limbs
would
have
stiffened
into
uselessness
and
their
constitutions
would
have
been
unable
to
bear
the
call
of
any
sudden
emergency
one
of
them
has
four
residences
in
different
parts
of
the
same
county
and
yet
he
will
not
keep
a
carriage
but
is
a
pedestrian
terrible
to
his
friends
the
other
is
at
the
head
of
a
great
business
and
gives
an
example
of
physical
activity
to
his
workpeople
both
have
an
absolute
faith
in
habitual
exercise
and
both
affirm
that
if
the
habit
were
once
broken
they
could
never
afterwards
resume
it
we
need
this
faith
in
exercise
this
firm
conviction
of
its
necessity
the
sort
of
conviction
that
makes
a
man
go
out
in
all
weathers
and
leave
the
most
urgent
intellectual
labor
for
the
mere
discipline
and
hardening
of
the
body
few
students
possess
this
faith
in
its
purity
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
we
shall
get
any
good
from
exercise
proportionate
to
the
sacrifice
of
time
the
incompatibility
between
the
physical
and
the
intellectual
lives
is
often
very
marked
if
you
look
at
small
spaces
of
time
only
but
if
you
consider
broader
spaces
such
as
a
lifetime
then
the
incompatibility
is
not
so
marked
and
gives
place
to
a
manifest
conciliation
the
brain
is
clearer
in
vigorous
health
than
it
can
be
in
the
gloom
and
misery
of
sickness
and
although
health
may
last
for
a
while
without
renewal
from
exercise
so
that
if
you
are
working
under
pressure
for
a
month
the
time
given
to
exercise
is
so
much
deducted
from
the
result
it
is
not
so
for
the
life
performance
health
sustained
for
many
years
is
so
useful
to
the
realization
of
all
considerable
intellectual
undertakings
that
the
sacrifice
to
the
bodily
is
the
best
of
all
possible
investments
franklin
theory
about
concentrating
his
exercise
for
the
economy
of
time
was
founded
upon
a
mistake
violent
exertion
for
minutes
is
equivalent
to
moderate
exercise
for
hours
the
desire
to
concentrate
good
of
various
kinds
into
the
smallest
possible
space
is
one
of
the
commonest
of
wishes
but
it
is
not
encouraged
by
the
broader
economy
of
nature
in
the
exercise
of
the
mind
every
teacher
is
well
aware
that
time
is
an
essential
factor
it
is
necessary
to
with
a
study
for
hundreds
or
thousands
of
hours
before
the
mind
can
assimilate
as
much
of
the
subject
as
it
may
need
and
so
it
is
necessary
to
live
in
exercise
during
a
thousand
hours
of
every
year
to
make
sure
of
the
physical
benefits
even
the
fresh
air
itself
requires
time
to
renovate
our
blood
the
fresh
air
can
not
be
concentrated
and
to
breathe
the
prodigious
quantities
of
it
which
are
needed
for
perfect
energy
we
must
be
out
in
it
frequently
and
long
the
inhabitants
of
great
cities
have
recourse
to
gymnastics
as
a
substitute
for
the
sports
of
the
country
these
exercises
have
one
advantage
they
can
be
directed
scientifically
so
as
to
strengthen
the
limbs
that
need
development
but
no
city
gymnasium
can
offer
the
invigorating
breezes
of
the
mountain
we
require
not
only
exercise
but
exposure
daily
exposure
to
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
the
postman
who
brings
my
letters
walks
eight
thousand
miles
a
year
and
enjoys
the
most
perfect
regularity
of
health
there
are
operatives
in
factories
who
go
through
quite
as
much
bodily
exertion
but
they
have
not
his
fine
condition
he
is
as
merry
as
a
lark
and
announces
himself
every
morning
like
a
bearer
of
joyful
tidings
what
the
postman
does
from
necessity
an
old
gentleman
did
as
regularly
though
more
moderately
for
the
preservation
of
his
health
and
faculties
he
went
out
every
day
and
as
he
never
consulted
the
weather
so
he
never
had
to
consult
the
physicians
nothing
in
the
habits
of
wordsworth
that
model
of
excellent
habits
can
be
better
as
an
example
to
men
of
letters
than
his
love
of
pedestrian
excursions
wherever
he
happened
to
be
he
explored
the
whole
neighborhood
on
foot
looking
into
every
nook
and
cranny
of
it
and
not
merely
the
immediate
neighborhood
but
extended
tracts
of
country
and
in
this
way
he
met
with
much
of
his
best
material
scott
was
both
a
pedestrian
and
an
equestrian
traveller
having
often
as
he
tells
us
walked
thirty
miles
or
ridden
a
hundred
in
those
rich
and
beautiful
districts
which
afterwards
proved
to
him
such
a
mine
of
literary
wealth
goethe
took
a
wild
delight
in
all
sorts
of
physical
exercise
swimming
in
the
ilm
by
moonlight
skating
with
the
merry
little
weimar
court
on
the
schwansee
riding
about
the
country
on
horseback
and
becoming
at
times
quite
outrageous
in
the
rich
exuberance
of
his
energy
alexander
humboldt
was
delicate
in
his
youth
but
the
longing
for
great
enterprises
made
him
dread
the
hindrances
of
physical
insufficiency
so
he
accustomed
his
body
to
exercise
and
fatigue
and
prepared
himself
for
those
wonderful
explorations
which
opened
his
great
career
here
are
intellectual
lives
which
were
forwarded
in
their
special
aims
by
habits
of
physical
exercise
and
in
an
earlier
age
have
we
not
also
the
example
of
the
greatest
intellect
of
a
great
epoch
the
astonishing
leonardo
da
vinci
who
took
such
a
delight
in
horsemanship
that
although
as
vasari
tells
us
poverty
visited
him
often
he
never
could
sell
his
horses
or
dismiss
his
grooms
the
physical
and
intellectual
lives
are
not
incompatible
i
may
go
farther
and
affirm
that
the
physical
activity
of
men
eminent
in
literature
has
added
abundance
to
their
material
and
energy
to
their
style
that
the
activity
of
scientific
men
has
led
them
to
innumerable
discoveries
and
that
even
the
more
sensitive
and
contemplative
study
of
the
fine
arts
has
been
carried
to
a
higher
perfection
by
artists
who
painted
action
in
which
they
had
had
their
part
or
natural
beauty
which
they
had
travelled
far
to
see
even
philosophy
itself
owes
much
to
mere
physical
courage
and
endurance
how
much
that
is
noblest
in
ancient
thinking
may
be
due
to
the
hardy
health
of
socrates
letter
vi
to
an
author
in
mortal
disease
considering
death
as
a
certainty
the
wisdom
learned
from
suffering
employment
of
happier
intervals
the
teaching
of
the
diseased
not
to
be
rejected
their
double
experience
ignorance
of

spoiled
children
benefit
of
disinterested

reasons
for
pursuing

labors

the

bixio
lay
on
his
his
friend
labrousse
visited
him
and
exclaimed
on
entering
the
room
how
well
you
are
looking
to
this
bixio
who
was
clearly
aware
of
his
condition
answered
in
these
words
voyons
mon
pauvre
labrousse
tu
viens
voir
un
homme
qui
plus
quart
a
vivre
et
tu
veux
lui
faire
croire
a
bonne

allons
une
poignée
de

cela
vaut
mieux
pour
un
homme
que
tous
ces
petits
i
will
vex
you
with
none
of
these
but
wearisome
little
falsehoods
we
both
of
us
know
your
state
we
both
know
that
your
malady
though
it
may
be
alleviated
can
never
be
cured
and
that
the
fatal
termination
of
it
though
delayed
by
all
the
artifices
of
science
will
certainly
arrive
at
last
the
cheerful
courage
which
enables
you
to
look
this
certainty
in
the
face
has
also
enabled
you
to
extract
from
years
of
suffering
that
profoundest
wisdom
which
as
one
of
the
wisest
of
living
englishmen
has
told
us
can
be
learned
from
suffering
alone
the
admirable
elasticity
of
your
intellectual
and
moral
nature
has
enabled
you
in
the
intervals
of
physical
uneasiness
or
pain
to
cast
aside
every
morbid
thought
to
enter
quite
fully
and
heartily
into
the
healthy
life
of
others
and
to
enjoy
the
magnificent
spectacle
of
the
universe
with
contented
submission
to
its
laws
those
beneficent
yet
relentless
laws
which
to
you
bring
debility
and
death
you
have
continued
to
write
notwithstanding
the
progress
of
your
malady
and
yet
since
it
has
so
pitilessly
held
you
there
is
no
other
change
in
the
spirit
of
your
compositions
than
the
deepening
of
a
graver
beauty
the
addition
of
a
sweeter
seriousness
not
one
sentence
that
you
have
written
betrays
either
the
injustice
of
the
invalid
or
his
irritability
your
mind
is
not
clouded
by
any
mist
from
the
fever
marshes
but
its
sympathies
are
far
more
active
than
they
were
your
pain
has
taught
you
a
tender
pity
for
all
the
pain
that
is
outside
of
you
and
a
patient
gentleness
which
was
wanting
to
your
nature
in
its
days
of
barbarian
health
surely
it
would
be
a
lamentable
error
if
mankind
were
to
carry
out
the
recommendation
of
certain
ruthless
philosophers
and
reject
the
help
and
teaching
of
the
diseased
without
undervaluing
the
robust
performance
of
healthy
natures
and
without
encouraging
literature
that
is
morbid
that
is
fevered
impatient
and
perverse
we
may
still
prize
the
noble
teaching
which
is
the
testament
of
sufferers
to
the
world
the
diseased
have
a
peculiar
and
mysterious
experience
they
have
known
the
sensations
of
health
and
then
in
addition
to
this
knowledge
they
have
gained
another
knowledge
which
enables
them
to
think
more
accurately
even
of
health
itself
a
life
without
suffering
would
be
like
a
picture
without
shade
the
pets
of
nature
who
do
not
know
what
suffering
is
and
can
not
realize
it
have
always
a
certain
rawness
like
foolish
landsmen
who
laugh
at
the
terrors
of
the
ocean
because
they
have
neither
experience
enough
to
know
what
those
terrors
are
nor
brains
enough
to
imagine
them
you
who
are
borne
along
slowly
but
irresistibly
to
that
niagara
which
plunges
into
the
gulf
of
death
you
who
with
perfect
and
heroic
cheerfulness
are
counting
the
last
miles
of
the
voyage
find
leisure
to
study
and
think
as
the
boat
glides
onwards
silently
to
the
inevitable
end
it
is
one
of
the
happiest
privileges
of
the
high
intellectual
life
that
it
can
elevate
us
at
least
in
the
intervals
of
relief
from
complete
prostration
or
acute
pain
to
regions
of
disinterested
thought
where
all
personal
anxieties
are
forgotten
to
feel
that
he
is
still
able
even
in
days
of
physical
weakness
and
decline
to
add
something
to
the
world
inheritance
of
knowledge
or
to
bequeath
to
it
some
new
and
noble
thought
in
the
pearl
of
complete
expression
is
a
profound
satisfaction
to
the
active
mind
that
is
lodged
in
a
perishing
body
many
diseases
fortunately
permit
this
activity
to
the
last
and
i
do
not
hesitate
to
affirm
that
the
work
done
in
the
time
of
physical
decline
has
in
not
a
few
instances
been
the
most
perfect
and
the
most
permanently
valuable
it
is
not
accurately
true
that
the
mind
and
the
body
invariably
fail
together
physicians
who
know
how
prevalent
chronic
diseases
are
and
how
many
eminent
men
are
physically
inconvenienced
by
them
know
also
that
minds
of
great
spiritual
energy
possess
the
wonderful
faculty
of
indefinitely
improving
themselves
whilst
the
body
steadily
deteriorates
nor
is
there
anything
irrational
in
this
persistent
improvement
of
the
mind
even
to
the
extremest
limit
of
material
decay
for
the
mind
of
every
intellectual
human
being
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
great
permanent
mind
of
humanity
and
even
if
its
influence
soon
ceases
to
be
traceable
if
the
spoken
words
are
forgotten
if
the
written
volume
is
not
reprinted
or
even
quoted
it
has
not
worked
in
vain
the
intellectual
light
of
europe
in
this
century
is
not
only
due
to
great
luminaries
whom
every
one
can
name
but
to
millions
of
thoughtful
persons
now
utterly
forgotten
who
in
their
time
loved
the
light
and
guarded
it
and
increased
it
and
carried
it
into
many
lands
and
bequeathed
it
as
a
sacred
trust
he
who
labors
only
for
his
personal
pleasure
may
well
be
discouraged
by
the
shortness
and
uncertainty
of
life
and
cease
from
his
selfish
toil
on
the
first
approaches
of
disease
but
whoever
has
fully
realized
the
grand
continuity
of
intellectual
tradition
and
taken
his
own
place
in
it
between
the
future
and
the
past
will
work
till
he
can
work
no
more
and
then
gaze
hopefully
on
the
world
great
future
like
geoffroy
when
his
blind
eyes
beheld
the
future
of

of
all
the
five

indispensable
to
their
perfection
great
value
of
longevity
to
the
intellectual
life
it
is
always
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
pass
an
evening
at
your
house
but
on
the
last
occasion
that
pleasure
was
very
much
enhanced
because
you
were
once
more
with
us
i
watched
your
mother
eyes
as
she
sat
in
her
place
in
the
they
followed
you
almost
without
ceasing
and
there
was
the
sweetest
happiest
expression
on
her
dear
face
that
betrayed
her
tender
maternal
love
for
you
and
her
legitimate
maternal
pride
your
father
was
equally
happy
in
his
own
way
he
was
much
more
gay
and
talkative
than
i
have
seen
him
for
two
or
three
anxious
years
he
told
amusing
stories
he
entered
playfully
into
the
jests
of
others
he
had
pleasant
projects
for
the
future
and
spoke
of
them
with
facetious
exaggeration
i
sat
quietly
in
my
corner
slyly
observing
my
old
friends
and
amusing
myself
by
discovering
it
did
not
need
much
perspicacity
for
that
the
hidden
sources
of
the
happiness
that
was
so
clearly
visible
they
were
gladdened
by
the
first
successes
of
your
manhood
by
the
evidence
of
your
strength
by
the
realization
of
hopes
long
cherished
watching
this
charming
picture
with
a
perfect
sympathy
i
began
to
have
certain
thoughts
of
my
own
which
it
is
my
present
purpose
to
communicate
to
you
without
disguise
i
thought
first
how
agreeable
it
was
to
be
the
spectator
of
so
pretty
a
picture
but
then
my
eyes
wandered
to
a
painting
that
hung
upon
the
walls
in
which
also
there
were
a
mother
and
her
son
and
this
led
me
a
long
way
the
painting
was
a
hundred
years
old
but
although
the
colors
were
not
quite
so
fresh
as
when
they
left
the
palette
of
the
artist
the
beautiful
youth
who
stood
radiant
like
a
young
apollo
in
the
centre
of
the
composition
had
not
lost
one
of
the
great
gifts
with
which
his
cunning
human
creator
had
endowed
him
the
fire
of
his
eye
had
not
been
quenched
by
time
the
bloom
of
his
cheek
still
flushed
with
faint
vermilion
his
lip
was
full
and
imperious
his
limbs
athletic
his
bearing
haughty
and
dauntless
all
life
seemed
spread
before
him
like
a
beautiful
rich
estate
of
which
every
acre
was
his
own
how
easily
will
he
conquer
fame
how
easily
kindle
passion
who
shall
withstand
this
pink
and
perfection
of
aristocracy
this
ideal
of
the
age
of
fine
gentlemen
with
all
the
gifts
of
nature
helped
by
all
the
inventions
of
art
then
i
thought
farther
that
splendid
young
nobleman
in
the
picture
will
look
just
as
young
as
he
does
now
when
we
shall
be
either
superannuated
or
dead
and
i
looked
at
you
and
your
mother
again
and
thought
it
is
just
five
minutes
since
i
saw
these
two
living
beings
and
in
this
little
space
of
time
they
have
both
of
them
aged
a
little
though
no
human
observer
has
enough
delicacy
of
perception
to
detect
so
inappreciable
an
alteration
i
went
gradually
on
and
on
into
the
future
trying
to
imagine
the
changes
which
would
come
over
yourself
more
especially
for
it
was
you
who
were
the
centre
of
my
reverie
till
at
last
i
imagined
pretty
accurately
what
you
might
be
at
sixty
but
there
it
became
necessary
to
stop
because
it
was
too
difficult
to
conceive
the
processes
of
decay
after
this
one
thought
grew
upon
me
and
became
dominant
i
thought
at
present
he
has
all
the
senses
in
their
perfection
and
they
serve
him
without
a
hitch
he
is
an
intelligence
served
by
organs
and
the
organs
are
all
doing
their
duty
as
faithfully
as
a
postman
who
brings
letters
when
the
postman
becomes
too
infirm
to
do
his
work
he
will
retire
on
his
little
pension
and
another
will
take
his
place
and
bring
the
letters
just
as
regularly
but
when
the
human
organs
become
infirm
they
can
not
be
taken
out
and
replaced
by
new
ones
so
that
we
must
content
ourselves
to
the
end
with
their
service
such
as
it
may
be
then
i
reflected
how
useful
the
senses
are
to
the
high
intellectual
life
and
how
wise
it
is
even
for
intellectual
purposes
to
preserve
them
as
long
as
possible
in
their
perfection
to
be
able
to
see
and
hear
well
to
feel
healthy
sensations
even
to
taste
and
smell
properly
are
most
important
qualifications
for
the
pursuit
of
literature
and
art
and
science
if
you
read
attentively
the
work
of
any
truly
illustrious
poet
you
will
find
that
the
whole
of
the
imagery
which
gives
power
and
splendor
to
his
verse
is
derived
from
nature
through
one
or
other
of
these
ordinary
channels
some
philosophers
have
gone
much
farther
than
this
and
have
affirmed
that
the
entire
intellectual
life
is
based
ultimately
upon
remembered
physical
sensations
that
we
have
no
mental
conception
that
is
really
independent
of
sensuous
experience
and
that
the
most
abstract
thought
is
only
removed
from
sensation
by
successive
processes
of
substitution
i
have
not
space
to
enter
into
so
great
and
mysterious
a
subject
as
this
but
i
desire
to
draw
your
attention
to
a
truth
very
commonly
overlooked
by
intellectual
people
which
is
the
enormous
importance
of
the
organs
of
sense
in
the
highest
intellectual
pursuits
i
will
couple
together
two
names
which
have
owed
their
celebrity
one
chiefly
to
the
use
of
her
ears
the
other
to
the
use
of
his
eyes
madame
de
stael
obtained
her
literary
material
almost
exclusively
by
means
of
conversation
she
directed
systematically
the
talk
of
the
learned
and
brilliant
men
amongst
whom
she
lived
to
the
subject
which
for
the
moment
happened
to
occupy
her
thoughts
her
literary
process
which
is
known
to
us
in
detail
through
the
revelations
of
her
friends
was
purposely
invented
to
catch
everything
that
she
heard
as
a
net
catches
fish
in
a
river
first
she
threw
down
on
paper
a
very
brief
rough
draft
of
the
intended
literary
project
this
she
showed
to
few
but
from
it
she
made
a
second
state
as
an
engraver
would
say
which
she
exhibited
to
some
of
her
trusted
friends
profiting
by
their
hints
and
suggestions
her
secretary
copied
the
corrected
manuscript
incorporating
the
new
matter
on
paper
with
a
very
broad
margin
for
farther
additions
during
all
the
time
that
it
took
to
carry
her
work
through
these
successive
states
that
ingenious
woman
made
the
best
possible
use
of
her
ears
which
were
her
natural
providers
she
made
everybody
talk
who
was
likely
to
be
of
any
use
to
her
and
then
immediately
added
what
she
had
caught
on
the
wide
margin
reserved
for
that
purpose
she
used
her
eyes
so
little
that
she
might
almost
as
well
have
been
blind
we
have
it
on
her
own
authority
that
were
it
not
out
of
respect
to
custom
she
would
not
open
her
window
to
see
the
bay
of
naples
for
the
first
time
whereas
she
would
travel
five
hundred
leagues
to
talk
with
a
clever
man
whom
she
had
never
met
now
since
madame
de
stael
genius
fed
itself
exclusively
through
the
faculty
of
hearing
what
an
enormous
difference
it
would
have
made
to
her
if
she
had
been
deaf
it
is
probable
that
the
whole
of
her
literary
reputation
was
dependent
on
the
condition
of
her
ears
even
a
very
moderate
degree
of
deafness
just
enough
to
make
listening
irksome
might
have
kept
her
in
perpetual
obscurity
the
next
instance
i
intend
to
give
is
that
of
a
distinguished
contemporary
ruskin
his
peculiar
position
in
literature
is
due
to
his
being
able
to
see
as
cultivated
artists
see
everything
that
is
best
and
most
original
in
his
writings
is
invariably
either
an
account
of
what
he
has
seen
in
his
own
independent
inimitable
way
or
else
a
criticism
of
the
accurate
or
defective
sight
of
others
his
method
of
study
by
drawing
and
taking
written
memoranda
of
what
he
has
seen
is
entirely
different
from
madame
de
stael
method
but
refers
always
as
hers
did
to
the
testimony
of
the
predominant
sense
every
one
whose
attention
has
been
attracted
to
the
subject
is
aware
that
amongst
people
who
are
commonly
supposed
to
see
equally
well
and
who
are
not
suspected
of
any
tendency
to
blindness
the
degrees
of
perfection
in
this
sense
vary
to
infinity
suppose
that
ruskin
to
our
great
misfortune
had
been
endowed
with
no
better
eyes
than
many
persons
who
see
fairly
well
in
the
ordinary
sense
his
enjoyment
and
use
of
sight
would
have
been
so
much
diminished
that
he
would
have
had
little
enthusiasm
about
seeing
and
yet
that
kind
of
enthusiasm
was
quite
essential
to
his
work
the
instance
of
prescott
the
historian
is
no
doubt
a
striking
proof
what
be
accomplished
by
a
man
of
remarkable
intellectual
ability
without
the
help
of
sight
or
rather
helped
by
the
sight
of
others
we
have
also
heard
of
a
blind
traveller
and
even
of
a
blind
entomologist
but
in
all
cases
of
this
kind
they
are
executive
difficulties
to
be
overcome
such
that
only
the
most
resolute
natures
would
ever
dream
of
encountering
them
when
the
materials
for
the
reign
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
arrived
in
prescott
house
from
europe
his
remaining
eye
had
just
suffered
from
to
such
a
degree
that
he
could
not
use
it
again
for
years
i
well
remember
he
wrote
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
the
blank
despair
which
i
felt
when
my
literary
treasures
arrived
and
i
saw
the
mine
of
wealth
lying
around
me
which
i
was
forbidden
to
explore
and
although
by
a
most
tedious
process
which
would
have
worn
out
the
patience
of
any
other
author
prescott
did
at
last
arrive
at
the
conclusion
of
his
work
it
cost
him
ten
years
of
labor
probably
thrice
as
much
time
as
would
have
been
needed
by
an
author
of
equal
intellectual
ability
without
any
infirmity
of
sight
although
of
the
five
senses
which
god
has
given
us
sight
and
hearing
are
the
most
necessary
to
the
intellectual
life
it
may
easily
be
demonstrated
that
the
lower
ones
are
not
without
their
intellectual
uses
perfect
literature
and
art
can
only
he
produced
by
men
who
are
perfect
in
all
their
natural
faculties
the
great
creative
intellects
have
never
been
ascetics
they
have
been
rightly
and
healthily
sensitive
to
every
kind
of
pleasure
the
taste
of
fruits
and
wines
the
perfume
of
flowers
are
a
part
of
the
means
by
which
the
spirit
of
nature
influences
our
most
secret
thoughts
and
conveys
to
us
suggestions
or
carries
us
into
states
of
feeling
which
have
an
enormous
effect
upon
our
thinking
though
the
manner
in
which
the
effect
is
produced
is
one
of
the
deepest
mysteries
of
our
mysterious
being
when
the
caliph
vathek
added
five
wings
to
the
palace
of
alkoremmi
on
the
hill
of
pied
horses
for
the
particular
gratification
of
each
of
his
five
senses
he
only
did
on
a
uselessly
large
scale
what
every
human
being
does
when
he
can
afford
it
on
a
small
one
you
will
not
suspect
me
of
preaching
unlimited
indulgence
the
very
object
of
this
letter
is
to
recommend
for
intellectual
purposes
the
careful
preservation
of
the
senses
in
the
freshness
of
their
perfection
and
this
is
altogether
incompatible
with
every
species
of
excess
if
you
are
to
see
clearly
all
your
life
you
must
not
sacrifice
eyesight
by
it
and
the
same
law
of
moderation
is
the
condition
of
preserving
every
other
faculty
i
want
you
to
know
the
exquisite
taste
of
common
dry
bread
to
enjoy
the
perfume
of
a
larch
wood
at
a
distance
to
feel
delight
when
a
dashes
over
you
i
want
your
eye
to
be
so
sensitive
that
it
shall
discern
the
faintest
tones
of
a
gray
cloud
and
yet
so
strong
that
it
shall
bear
to
gaze
on
a
white
one
in
the
dazzling
glory
of
sunshine
i
would
have
your
hearing
sharp
enough
to
detect
the
music
of
the
spheres
if
it
were
but
audible
and
yet
your
nervous
system
robust
enough
to
endure
the
shock
of
the
guns
on
an
ironclad
to
have
and
keep
these
powers
we
need
a
firmness
of
that
is
rare
young
men
are
careless
of
longevity
but
how
precious
are
added
years
to
the
fulness
of
the
intellectual
life
there
are
lives
such
as
that
of
major
pendennis
which
only
diminish
in
value
as
they
advance
when
the
man
of
fashion
is
no
longer
fashionable
and
the
sportsman
can
no
longer
stride
over
the
ploughed
fields
the
old
age
of
the
major
pendennises
is
assuredly
not
to
be
envied
but
how
rich
is
the
age
of
the
hunboldts
i
compare
the
life
of
the
intellectual
to
a
long
wedge
of
gold
the
thin
end
of
it
begins
at
birth
and
the
depth
and
value
of
it
go
on
indefinitely
increasing
till
at
last
comes
death
a
personage
for
whom
nathaniel
hawthorne
had
a
peculiar
dislike
for
his
unmannerly
habit
of
interruption
who
stops
the
auriferous
processes
oh
the
mystery
of
the
nameless
ones
who
have
died
when
the
wedge
was
thin
and
looked
so
poor
and
light
oh
the
happiness
of
the
fortunate
old
men
whose
thoughts
went
deeper
and
deeper
like
a
wall
that
runs
out
into
the
sea
one
of
the
most
painful
cases
of
interruption
caused
by
death
is
that
of
cuvier
his
paralysis
came
upon
him
whilst
he
was
still
in
full
activity
and
death
prevented
him
from
arranging
a
great
accumulation
of
scientific
material
he
said
to
pasquier
i
had
great
things
still
to
do
all

years
of
labor
and
research
there
remained
but

and
now
the
hands
fail
and
carry
with
them
the
head
but
the
most
lamentable
instances
of
this
kind
of
interruption
are
from
the
nature
of
things
unknown
to
us
even
the
friends
of
the
deceased
can
not
estimate
the
extent
of
the
loss
for
a
man

giordano
bruno
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
you
believed
the
inducement
to
what
i
called
intellectual
living
to
be
merely
the
love
of
pleasure
pleasure
of
a
higher
kind
no
doubt
than
that
which
we
derive
from
wine
yet
fairly
comparable
to
it
you
went
on
to
say
that
you
could
not
from
the
moral
point
of
view
discern
any
appreciable
difference
between
intoxicating
oneself
by
means
of
literature
or
art
and
getting
tipsy
on
port
wine
or
brandy
that
the
reading
of
poetry
most
especially
was
clearly
a
service
of
venus
and
bacchus
in
which
the
suggestions
of
words
were
used
as
substitutes
for
the
harem
and
the
completing
the
expression
of
this
idea
you
said
that
the
excitement
produced
by
oratory
was
exactly
of
the
same
nature
as
the
excitement
produced
by
gin
so
that
mr
bright
and
gambetta
nay
even
a
gentleman
so
respectable
as
the
late
lord
derby
belonged
strictly
to
the
same
profession
as
the
publicans
being
dealers
in
stimulants
and
no
more
the
habitual
student
was
in
your
view
nothing
better
than
the
helpless
victim
of
unresisted
appetite
to
whom
intellectual
intoxication
having
been
at
first
a
pleasure
had
finally
become
a
necessity
you
added
that
any
rational
person
who
found
himself
sinking
into
such
a
deplorable
condition
as
this
would
have
recourse
to
some
severe
discipline
as
a
preservative
a
discipline
requiring
close
attention
to
common
things
and
rigorously
excluding
every
variety
of
thought
which
could
possibly
be
considered
intellectual
it
is
strictly
true
that
the
three
intellectual
pursuits
literature
science
and
the
fine
arts
are
all
of
them
strong
stimulants
and
that
men
are
attracted
to
them
by
the
stimulus
they
give
but
these
occupations
are
morally
much
nearer
to
the
common
level
of
other
occupations
than
you
suppose
there
is
no
doubt
a
certain
intoxication
in
poetry
and
painting
but
i
have
seen
a
tradesman
find
a
fully
equivalent
intoxication
in
an
addition
of
figures
showing
a
delightful
balance
at
his
banker
i
have
seen
a
young
poet
intoxicated
with
the
love
of
poetry
but
i
have
also
seen
a
young
mechanical
genius
on
whom
the
sight
of
a
locomotive
acted
exactly
like
a
bottle
of
champagne
everything
that
is
capable
of
exciting
or
moving
man
everything
that
fires
him
with
enthusiasm
everything
that
sustains
his
energies
above
the
dead
level
of
merely
animal
existence
may
be
compared
and
not
very
untruly
to
the
action
of
generous
wine
the
two
most
powerful
mental
stimulants
since
they
overcome
even
the
fear
of
death
are
unquestionably
religion
and
patriotism
ardent
states
of
feeling
both
of
them
when
they
are
genuine
yet
this
ardor
has
a
great
utility
it
enables
men
to
bear
much
to
perform
much
which
would
be
beyond
their
natural
force
if
it
were
not
sustained
by
powerful
mental
stimulants
and
so
it
is
in
the
intellectual
life
it
is
because
its
labors
are
so
severe
that
its
pleasures
are
so
glorious
the
creator
of
intellectual
man
set
him
the
most
arduous
tasks
tasks
that
required
the
utmost
possible
patience
courage
and
which
at
the
same
time
were
for
the
most
part
from
their
very
nature
likely
to
receive
only
the
most
meagre
and
precarious
pecuniary
reward
therefore
in
order
that
so
poor
and
weak
a
creature
might
execute
its
gigantic
works
with
the
energy
necessary
to
their
permanence
the
labor
itself
was
made
intensely
attractive
and
interesting
to
the
few
who
were
fitted
for
it
by
their
constitution
since
their
courage
could
not
be
maintained
by
any
of
the
common
motives
which
carry
men
through
ordinary
drudgery
since
neither
wealth
nor
worldly
position
was
in
their
prospects
the
drudgery
they
had
to
go
through
was
to
be
rewarded
by
the
triumphs
of
scientific
discovery
by
the
felicities
of
artistic
expression
a
divine
drunkenness
was
given
to
them
for
their
encouragement
surpassing
the
gift
of
the
grape
but
now
that
i
have
acknowledged
not
ungratefully
the
necessity
of
that
noble
excitement
which
is
the
life
of
life
it
is
time
for
me
to
add
that
in
the
daily
labor
of
all
intellectual
workers
much
has
to
be
done
which
requires
a
robustness
of
the
moral
constitution
beyond
what
you
appear
to
be
aware
of
it
is
not
long
since
the
present
bishop
of
exeter
truly
affirmed
in
an
address
to
a
body
of
students
that
if
there
were
not
weariness
in
work
that
work
was
not
so
as
it
ought
to
be
of
all
work
the
bishop
said
that
produces
results
must
be
drudgery
there
is
no
work
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
which
can
be
done
well
by
any
man
who
is
unwilling
to
make
that
sacrifice
part
of
the
very
nobility
of
the
devotion
of
the
true
workman
to
his
work
consists
in
the
fact
that
a
man
is
not
daunted
by
finding
that
drudgery
must
be
done
and
no
man
can
really
succeed
in
any
walk
of
life
without
a
good
deal
of
what
in
ordinary
english
is
called
pluck
that
is
the
condition
of
all
work
whatever
and
it
is
the
condition
of
all
success
and
there
is
nothing
which
so
truly
repays
itself
as
this
very
perseverance
against
weariness
you
understand
no
doubt
that
there
is
drudgery
in
the
work
of
a
lawyer
or
an
accountant
but
you
imagine
that
there
is
no
drudgery
in
that
of
an
artist
or
author
or
man
of
science
in
these
cases
you
fancy
that
there
is
nothing
but
a
pleasant
intoxication
like
the
puffing
of
tobacco
or
the
sipping
of
claret
after
dinner
the
bishop
sees
more
accurately
he
knows
that
of
work
that
produces
results
must
be
drudgery
he
makes
no
exceptions
in
favor
of
the
arts
and
sciences
if
he
had
made
any
such
exceptions
they
would
have
proved
the
absence
of
culture
in
himself
real
work
of
all
descriptions
even
including
the
composition
of
poetry
the
most
intoxicating
of
all
human
pursuits
contains
drudgery
in
so
large
a
proportion
that
considerable
moral
courage
is
necessary
to
carry
it
to
a
successful
issue
some
of
the
most
popular
writers
of
verse
have
dreaded
the
labor
of
composition
wordsworth
shrank
from
it
much
more
sensitively
than
he
did
from
his
prosaic
labors
as
a
distributor
of
stamps
he
had
that
de
la
which
is
a
frequent
malady
amongst
literary
men
but
we
feel
in
reading
wordsworth
that
composition
was
a
serious
toil
to
him
the
drudgery
is
often
visible
let
me
take
then
the
case
of
a
writer
of
verse
distinguished
especially
for
fluency
and
ease
the
lightest
gayest
apparently
most
thoughtless
of
modern
minstrels
the
author
of
the
irish
melodies
and
lalla
rookh
moore
said
i
quote
from
memory
and
may
not
give
the
precise
words
but
they
were
to
this
effect
that
although
the
first
shadowy
imagining
of
a
new
poem
was
a
delicious
fool
paradise
the
labor
of
actual
composition
was
something
altogether
different
he
did
not
i
believe
exactly
use
the
word
drudgery
but
his
expression
implied
that
there
was
painful
drudgery
in
the
work
when
he
began
to
write
lalla
rookh
the
task
was
anything
but
easy
to
him
he
said
that
he
was
at
all
times
a
far
more
slow
and
painstaking
workman
than
would
ever
be
guessed
from
the
result
for
a
long
time
after
the
conclusion
of
the
agreement
with
longman
though
generally
at
work
with
a
view
to
this
task
he
made
but
very
little
real
progress
in
it
after
many
unsatisfactory
attempts
finding
that
his
subjects
were
so
slow
in
kindling
his
own
sympathies
he
began
to
despair
of
their
ever
touching
the
hearts
of
others
had
this
series
of
disheartening
experiments
been
carried
on
much
further
i
must
have
thrown
aside
the
work
in
despair
he
took
the
greatest
pains
in
long
and
laboriously
preparing
himself
by
reading
to
form
a
storehouse
as
it
were
of
illustrations
purely
oriental
and
so
familiarize
myself
with
its
various
treasures
that
quick
as
fancy
required
the
aid
of
fact
in
her
spiritings
the
memory
was
ready
to
furnish
materials
for
the
such
was
for
a
long
while
the
sole
object
of
my
studies
after
quoting
some
opinions
favorable
to
the
truth
of
his
oriental
coloring
he
says
whatever
of
vanity
there
may
be
in
citing
such
tributes
they
show
at
least
of
what
great
value
even
in
poetry
is
that
prosaic
quality
industry
since
it
was
in
a
slow
and
laborious
collection
of
small
facts
that
the
first
foundations
of
this
fanciful
romance
were
laid
other
fine
arts
make
equally
large
claims
upon
the
industry
of
their
professors
we
see
the
charming
result
which
looks
as
if
it
were
nothing
but
pleasure
the
mere
sensuous
gratification
of
an
appetite
for
melody
or
color
but
no
one
ever
eminently
succeeded
in
music
or
painting
without
patient
submission
to
a
discipline
far
from
attractive
or
entertaining
an
idea
was
very
prevalent
amongst
the
upper
classes
in
england
between
twenty
and
thirty
years
ago
that
art
was
not
a
serious
pursuit
and
that
frenchmen
were
too
frivolous
to
apply
themselves
seriously
to
anything
when
however
the
different
schools
of
art
in
europe
came
to
be
exhibited
together
the
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
people
minds
that
the
french
and
belgian
schools
of
painting
had
a
certain
superiority
over
the
rest
a
superiority
of
quite
a
peculiar
sort
and
when
the
critics
applied
themselves
to
discover
the
hidden
causes
of
this
generally
perceived
superiority
they
found
out
that
it
was
due
in
great
measure
to
the
patient
drudgery
submitted
to
by
those
foreign
artists
in
their
youth
english
painters
who
have
attained
distinction
have
gone
through
a
like
drudgery
if
not
in
the
public
at
least
in
secrecy
and
solitude
john
lewis
in
reply
to
an
application
for
a
drawing
to
be
reproduced
by
the
autotype
process
and
published
in
the
said
that
his
sketches
and
studies
were
all
in
color
but
if
we
liked
to
examine
them
we
were
welcome
to
select
anything
that
might
be
successfully
photographed
not
being
in
london
at
the
time
i
charged
an
experienced
friend
to
go
and
see
if
there
were
anything
that
would
answer
our
purpose
soon
afterward
he
wrote
i
have
just
been
to
see
john
lewis
and
have
come
away
he
had
seen
the
vast
foundations
of
private
industry
on
which
the
artist
public
work
had
been
erected
innumerable
studies
in
color
wrought
with
the
most
perfect
care
and
finish
and
all
for
merely
not
for
any
direct
reward
in
fame
we
have
all
admired
the
extraordinary
power
of
representation
in
the
little
pictures
of
meissonier
that
power
was
acquired
by
painting
studies
for
and
the
artist
has
sustained
his
knowledge
by
persistence
in
that
practice
mulready
between
the
conception
of
a
new
picture
and
the
execution
of
it
used
to
give
himself
a
special
training
for
the
intended
work
by
painting
a
study
in
color
of
every
separate
thing
that
was
to
form
part
of
the
composition
it
is
useless
to
go
on
multiplying
these
examples
since
all
great
artists
without
exception
have
been
distinguished
for
their
firm
faith
in
steady
labor
this
faith
was
so
strong
in
reynolds
that
it
limited
his
reasoning
powers
and
prevented
him
from
assigning
their
due
importance
to
the
inborn
natural
gifts
not
only
in
their
preparations
for
work
but
even
in
the
work
itself
do
artists
undergo
drudgery
it
is
the
peculiarity
of
their
work
that
more
than
any
other
human
work
it
displays
whatever
there
may
be
in
it
of
pleasure
and
felicity
putting
the
drudgery
as
much
out
of
sight
as
possible
but
all
who
know
the
secrets
of
the
studio
are
aware
of
the
ceaseless
struggles
against
technical
difficulty
which
are
the
price
of
the
charms
that
pleasantly
deceive
us
the
amateur
tries
to
paint
in
and
finds
that
the
gradation
of
his
sky
will
not
come
right
instead
of
being
a
sound
gradation
like
that
of
the
heavenly
blue
it
is
all
in
spots
and
patches
then
he
goes
to
some
clever
artist
who
seems
to
get
the
right
thing
with
enviable
ease
is
my
paper
good
have
my
colors
been
properly
ground
the
materials
are
sound
enough
but
the
artist
confesses
one
of
the
discouraging
little
secrets
of
his
craft
the
fact
is
he
says
those
spots
that
you
complain
of
happen
to
all
of
us
and
very
troublesome
they
are
especially
in
dark
tints
the
only
way
is
to
remove
them
as
patiently
as
we
can
and
it
sometimes
takes
several
days
if
one
or
two
of
them
remain
in
spite
of
us
we
turn
them
into
birds
in
etching
the
most
famous
practitioners
get
into
messes
with
the
treacherous
chemistry
of
their
acids
and
need
an
invincible
patience
even
méryon
was
always
very
anxious
when
the
time
came
for
confiding
his
work
to
what
he
called
the
and
whenever
i
give
a
commission
to
an
etcher
i
am
always
expecting
some
such
despatch
as
the
following
plate
utterly
ruined
in
the
biting
very
sorry
will
begin
another
immediately
we
know
what
a
dreadful
series
of
mishaps
attended
our
at
westminster
and
now
even
the
promising
process
in
which
maclise
trusted
shows
the
bloom
of
premature
decay
the
safest
and
best
known
of
modern
processes
simple
has
its
own
dangers
also
the
colors
sink
and
alter
they
lose
their
relative
values
they
lose
their
pearly
purity
their
glowing
transparence
they
turn
to
buff
and
black
the
fine
arts
bristle
all
over
with
technical
difficulties
and
are
i
will
not
say
the
best
school
of
patience
in
the
world
for
many
other
pursuits
are
also
very
good
schools
of
patience
but
i
will
say
without
much
fear
of
contradiction
from
anybody
acquainted
with
the
subject
that
the
fine
arts
offer
drudgery
enough
and
disappointment
enough
to
be
a
training
both
in
patience
and
in
humility
in
the
labor
of
the
both
these
qualities
are
developed
to
the
pitch
of
perfect
heroism
he
sits
down
to
a
great
surface
of
steel
or
copper
and
day
by
day
week
after
week
month
after
month
ploughs
slowly
his
marvellous
lines
sometimes
the
picture
before
him
is
an
agreeable
companion
he
is
in
sympathy
with
the
painter
he
enjoys
every
touch
that
he
has
to
translate
but
sometimes
on
the
contrary
he
hates
the
picture
and
engraves
it
as
a
professional
duty
i
happened
to
call
upon
a
distinguished
english
engraver
a
man
of
the
greatest
taste
and
knowledge
a
refined
and
cultivated
critic
and
i
found
him
seated
at
work
before
a
thing
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
fine
art
a
medley
of
ugly
portraits
of
temperance
celebrities
on
a
platform
ah
he
said
to
me
sadly
you
see
the
dark
side
of
our
profession
fancy
sitting
down
to
a
desk
all
day
long
for
two
years
together
with
that
thing
to
occupy
your
thoughts
how
much
moral
fibre
was
needed
to
carry
to
a
successful
issue
so
repulsive
a
task
as
that
you
may
answer
that
a
on
the
roadside
surpasses
my
both
in
patience
and
in
humility
but
whereas
the
sensitiveness
of
the
has
been
deadened
by
his
mode
of
life
the
sensitiveness
of
the
engraver
has
been
continually
fostered
and
increased
an
ugly
picture
was
torture
to
his
cultivated
eye
and
he
had
to
bear
the
torture
all
day
long
like
the
pain
of
an
irritating
disease
still
even
the
has
secret
sources
of
entertainment
to
relieve
the
mortal
tedium
of
his
the
picture
may
be
hideous
but
the
engraver
has
hidden
consolations
in
the
exercise
of
his
wonderful
art
he
can
at
least
entertain
himself
with
feats
of
interpretative
skill
with
the
gentle
treacheries
of
improving
here
and
there
upon
the
hatefulness
of
the
intolerable
original
he
may
congratulate
himself
in
the
evening
that
one
more
frightful
hat
or
coat
has
been
got
rid
of
that
the
tiresome
task
has
been
reduced
by
a
space
measurable
in
eights
of
an
inch
the
heaviest
work
which
shows
progress
is
not
without
element
of
cheerfulness
there
is
a
great
deal
of
intellectual
labor
undergone
simply
for
discipline
which
shows
no
present
result
that
is
appreciable
and
which
therefore
requires
in
addition
to
patience
and
humility
one
of
the
noblest
of
the
moral
virtues
faith
of
all
the
toils
in
which
men
engage
none
are
nobler
in
their
origin
or
their
aim
than
those
by
which
they
endeavor
to
become
more
wise
pray
observe
that
whenever
the
desire
for
greater
wisdom
is
earnest
enough
to
sustain
men
in
these
high
endeavors
there
must
be
both
humility
and
faith
the
humility
which
acknowledges
present
insufficiency
the
faith
that
relies
upon
the
mysterious
laws
which
govern
our
intellectual
being
be
sure
that
there
has
been
great
moral
strength
in
all
who
have
come
to
intellectual
greatness
during
some
brief
moments
of
insight
the
mist
has
rolled
away
and
they
have
beheld
like
a
celestial
city
the
home
of
their
highest
aspirations
but
the
cloud
has
gathered
round
them
again
and
still
in
the
gloom
they
have
gone
steadily
forwards
stumbling
often
yet
maintaining
their
unconquerable
resolution
it
is
to
this
sublime
persistence
of
the
intellectual
in
other
ages
that
the
world
owes
the
treasures
which
they
won
it
is
by
a
like
persistence
that
we
may
hope
to
hand
them
down
augmented
to
the
future
their
intellectual
purposes
did
not
weaken
their
moral
nature
but
exercised
and
exalted
it
all
that
was
best
and
highest
in
the
imperfect
moral
nature
of
giordano
bruno
had
its
source
in
that
noble
passion
for
philosophy
which
made
him
declare
that
for
her
sake
it
was
easy
to
endure
labor
and

sir
arthur

in

wise
book
of
his
thoughts
upon
government
says
that
much
of
the
best
and
greatest
work
in
the
world
has
been
done
by
those
who
were
anything
but
docile
in
their
youth
he
believes
that
this
bold
statement
applies
not
only
to
the
greatest
men
in
science
literature
and
art
but
also
to
the
greatest
men
in
official
life
in
diplomacy
and
in
the
general
business
of
the
world
many
of
us
who
were
remarkable
for
our
indocility
in
boyhood
and
remarkable
for
nothing
else
have
found
much
consolation
in
this
passage
it
is
most
agreeable
to
be
told
by
a
writer
very
eminent
both
for
wisdom
and
for
culture
that
our
untowardness
was
a
hopeful
sign
another
popular
modern
writer
has
also
encouraged
us
by
giving
a
long
list
of
dunces
who
have
become
illustrious
yet
however
flattering
it
may
be
to
find
ourselves
in
such
excellent
company
at
least
so
far
as
the
earlier
half
of
life
may
be
concerned
we
can
not
quite
forget
the
very
numerous
instances
of
distinguished
persons
who
began
by
submitting
to
the
discipline
of
school
and
college
and
gained
honors
and
reputation
there
before
encountering
the
competition
of
the
world
the
external
discipline
applied
by
schoolmasters
is
a
substitute
for
that
inward
discipline
which
we
all
so
greatly
need
and
which
is
absolutely
indispensable
to
culture
whether
a
boy
happens
to
be
a
dunce
at
school
or
a
youth
of
brilliant
promise
his
future
intellectual
career
will
depend
very
much
on
his
moral
force
the
distinguished
men
who
derived
so
little
benefit
from
early
discipline
have
invariably
subjected
themselves
to
a
discipline
of
another
kind
which
prepared
them
for
the
labor
of
their
manhood
it
may
be
a
pure
assumption
to
say
this
but
the
assumption
is
confirmed
by
every
instance
that
is
known
to
me
many
eminent
men
have
undergone
the
discipline
of
business
many
like
franklin
have
been
but
i
have
never
heard
of
a
person
who
had
risen
to
intellectual
eminence
without
voluntary
submission
to
an
intellectual
discipline
of
some
kind
there
are
no
doubt
great
pleasures
attached
to
the
intellectual
life
and
quite
peculiar
to
it
but
these
pleasures
are
the
support
of
discipline
and
not
its
negation
they
give
us
the
cheerfulness
necessary
for
our
work
but
they
do
not
excuse
us
from
the
work
they
are
like
the
cup
of
coffee
served
to
a
soldier
on
duty
not
like
the
opium
which
incapacitates
for
everything
but
dreaming
i
have
been
led
into
these
observations
by
a
perusal
of
the
new
book
which
you
sent
me
it
has
many
qualities
which
in
a
young
writer
are
full
of
promise
it
is
earnest
and
lively
and
exuberant
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
undisciplined
now
i
believe
it
may
be
affirmed
that
although
there
has
been
much
literature
in
former
ages
which
was
both
vigorous
and
undisciplined
still
when
an
age
presents
as
ours
does
living
examples
of
perfect
intellectual
discipline
whoever
falls
below
them
in
this
respect
contents
himself
with
the
very
kind
of
inferiority
which
of
all
inferiorities
is
the
easiest
to
avoid
you
can
not
by
an
effort
of
the
will
hope
to
rival
the
brilliance
of
a
genius
but
you
may
quite
reasonably
expect
to
obtain
as
complete
a
control
over
your
own
faculties
and
your
own
work
as
any
other
person
the
origin
of
discipline
is
the
desire
to
do
not
merely
our
best
with
the
degree
of
power
and
knowledge
which
at
the
time
we
do
actually
happen
to
possess
but
with
that
which
we
possess
if
we
submitted
to
the
necessary
training
the
powers
given
to
us
by
nature
are
little
more
than
a
power
to
become
and
this
becoming
is
always
conditional
on
some
sort
of
exercise
what
sort
we
have
to
discover
for
ourselves
no
class
of
persons
are
so
liable
to
overlook
the
uses
of
discipline
as
authors
are
anybody
can
write
a
book
though
few
can
write
that
which
deserves
the
name
of
literature
there
are
great
technical
differences
between
literature
and
but
few
can
clearly
explain
these
differences
or
detect
in
their
own
case
the
absence
of
the
necessary
qualities
in
painting
the
most
perfect
finish
is
recognized
at
a
glance
but
the
mind
only
can
perceive
it
in
the
book
it
was
an
odd
notion
of
the
authorities
to
exhibit
literature
in
the
international
exhibitions
but
if
they
could
have
made
people
see
the
difference
between
sound
and
unsound
workmanship
in
the
literary
craft
they
would
have
rendered
a
great
service
to
the
higher
intellectual
discipline
sir
arthur
helps
might
have
served
as
an
example
to
english
writers
because
he
has
certain
qualities
in
which
we
are
grievously
deficient
he
can
say
a
thing
in
the
words
that
are
most
fit
and
necessary
and
then
leave
it
would
have
been
another
admirable
example
of
especially
to
frenchmen
who
would
do
well
to
imitate
him
in
his
horror
of
the
peu
he
never
began
to
write
about
anything
until
he
had
cleared
the
ground
well
before
him
he
never
spoke
about
any
character
or
doctrine
that
he
had
not
bottomed
to
use
word
as
far
as
he
was
able
he
had
an
extraordinary
aptitude
for
collecting
exactly
the
sort
of
material
that
he
needed
for
arranging
and
classifying
material
for
perceiving
its
mutual
relations
very
few
frenchmen
have
had
intense
repugnance
to
insufficiency
of
information
and
inaccuracy
of
language
few
indeed
are
the
french
journalists
of
whom
it
might
be
said
as
it
may
be
truly
said
of
that
he
never
wrote
even
an
article
for
a
newspaper
without
having
subjected
his
mind
to
a
special
training
for
that
particular
article
the
preparations
for
one
of
his
were
the
serious
occupation
of
several
laborious
days
and
before
beginning
the
actual
composition
his
mind
had
been
disciplined
into
a
state
of
the
most
complete
readiness
like
the
fingers
of
a
musician
who
has
been
practising
a
piece
before
he
executes
it
the
object
of
intellectual
discipline
is
the
establishment
of
a
strong
central
authority
in
the
mind
by
which
all
its
powers
are
regulated
and
directed
as
the
military
forces
of
a
nation
are
directed
by
the
strategist
who
arranges
the
operations
of
a
war
the
presence
of
this
strong
central
authority
is
made
manifest
in
the
unity
and
proportion
of
the
results
when
this
authority
is
absent
it
is
frequently
entirely
absent
from
the
minds
of
undisciplined
persons
especially
of
the
female
sex
you
have
a
chaos
of
complete
confusion
when
the
authority
without
being
absent
is
not
strong
enough
to
regulate
the
lively
activity
of
the

direction
too

a
regiment
could
have
done
the
work
and

where
you
want
guns

the

it
is
only

in
any

and

mind
to
exercise

without
such
a

power
there
is
neither
liberty

nor
security
of

the

says
locke
should
always
be
free
and
ready
to
turn
itself
to
the
variety
of
objects
that
occur
and
allow

shall
for
that

to

by

subject
as
not
to
be
prevailed
on
to
leave

for
another
that
we
judge
fitter
for
our

is
to
make

of
no
use

did
this
state
of
mind
always
remain
so
every

would
without

give
it
the
name
of
perfect
madness
and
whilst
it
does

intervals
it

of

about

writers
of
imaginative
literature
have
found
in
practice
that
even
the
creative
faculty
might
be
commanded
charles
baudelaire
who
had
the
poetical
organization
with
all
its
worst
inconveniencies
said
nevertheless
that
inspiration
is
decidedly
the
sister
of
daily
labor
these
two
contraries
do
not
exclude
each
other
more
than
all
the
other
contraries
which
constitute
nature
inspiration
obeys
like
hunger
like
digestion
like
sleep
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
mind
a
sort
of
celestial
mechanism
of
which
we
need
not
be
ashamed
but
we
ought
to
make
the
best
use
of
it
if
we
will
only
live
in
a
resolute
contemplation
of
next
day
work
the
daily
labor
will
serve
inspiration
in
cases
where
discipline
is
felt
to
be
very
difficult
it
is
generally
at
the
same
time
felt
to
be
very
desirable
george
sand
complains
that
although
to
overcome
the
indiscipline
of
her
brain
she
had
imposed
upon
herself
a
regular
way
of
living
and
a
daily
labor
still
twenty
times
out
of
thirty
she
catches
herself
reading
or
dreaming
or
writing
something
entirely
apart
from
the
work
in
hand
she
adds
that
without
this
frequent
intellectual
she
would
have
acquired
information
which
has
been
her
perpetual
but
unrealized
desire
it
is
the
triumph
of
discipline
to
overcome
both
small
and
great
repugnances
we
bring
ourselves
by
its
help
to
face
petty
details
that
are
wearisome
and
heavy
tasks
that
are
almost
appalling
nothing
shows
the
power
of
discipline
more
than
the
application
of
the
mind
in
the
common
trades
and
professions
to
subjects
which
have
hardly
any
interest
in
themselves
lawyers
are
especially
admirable
for
this
they
acquire
the
faculty
of
resolutely
applying
their
minds
to
the
dryest
documents
with
tenacity
enough
to
end
in
the
perfect
mastery
of
their
contents
a
feat
which
is
utterly
beyond
the
capacity
of
any
undisciplined
intellect
however
gifted
by
nature
in
the
case
of
lawyers
there
are
frequent
intellectual
repugnances
to
be
overcome
but
surgeons
and
other
men
of
science
have
to
vanquish
a
class
of
repugnances
even
less
within
the
power
of
the
will
the
instinctive
physical
repugnances
these
are
often
so
strong
as
to
seem
apparently
insurmountable
but
they
yield
to
persevering
discipline
although
haller
surpassed
his
contemporaries
in
anatomy
and
published
several
important
anatomical
works
he
was
troubled
at
the
outset
with
a
horror
of
dissection
beyond
what
is
usual
with
the
inexperienced
and
it
was
only
by
firm
that
he
became
an
anatomist
at
all
there
is
however
one
reserve
to
be
made
about
discipline
which
is
this
we
ought
not
to
disregard
altogether
the
mind
preferences
and
refusals
because
in
most
cases
they
are
the
indication
of
our
natural
powers
they
are
not
so
always
many
have
felt
attracted
to
pursuits
for
which
they
had
no
capacity
this
happens
continually
in
literature
and
the
fine
arts
whilst
others
have
greatly
distinguished
themselves
in
careers
which
were
not
of
their
own
choosing
and
for
which
they
felt
no
vocation
in
their
youth
still
there
exists
a
certain
relation
between
preference
and
capacity
which
may
often
safely
be
relied
upon
when
there
are
not
extrinsic
circumstances
to
attract
men
or
repel
them
discipline
becomes
an
evil
and
a
very
serious
evil
causing
immense
losses
of
special
talents
to
the
community
when
it
overrides
the
personal
preferences
entirely
we
are
less
in
danger
of
this
evil
however
from
the
discipline
which
we
impose
upon
ourselves
than
from
that
which
is
imposed
upon
us
by
the
opinion
of
the
society
in
which
we
live
the
intellectual
life
has
this
remarkable
peculiarity
as
to
discipline
that
whilst
very
severe
discipline
is
indispensable
to
it
that
which
it
really
needs
is
the
obedience
to
an
inward
law
an
obedience
which
is
not
only
compatible
with
revolt
against
other
people
notions
of
what
the
intellectual
man
ought
to
think
and
do
but
which
often
directly
leads
to
such
revolt
as
its
own
inevitable
result
in
the
attempt
to
subject
ourselves
to
the
inward
law
we
may
encounter
a
class
of
mental
refusals
which
indicate
no
congenital
incapacity
but
prove
that
the
mind
has
been
incapacitated
by
its
acquired
habits
and
its
ordinary
occupations
i
think
that
it
is
particularly
important
to
pay
attention
to
this
class
of
mental
refusals
and
to
give
them
the
fullest
consideration
suppose
the
case
of
a
man
who
has
a
fine
natural
capacity
for
painting
but
whose
time
has
been
taken
up
by
some
profession
which
has
formed
in
him
mental
habits
entirely
different
from
the
mental
habits
of
an
artist
the
inborn
capacity
for
art
might
whisper
to
this
man
what
if
you
were
to
abandon
your
profession
and
turn
painter
but
to
this
suggestion
of
the
inborn
capacity
the
acquired
unfitness
would
in
a
man
of
sense
most
probably
reply
no
painting
is
an
art
bristling
all
over
with
the
most
alarming
technical
difficulties
which
i
am
too
lazy
to
overcome
let
younger
men
attack
them
if
they
like
here
is
a
mental
refusal
of
a
kind
which
the
severest
ought
to
listen
to
this
is
nature
way
of
keeping
us
to
our
specialities
she
protects
us
by
means
of
what
superficial
moralists
condemn
as
one
of
the
minor
vices
the
disinclination
to
trouble
ourselves
without
necessity
when
the
work
involves
the
acquisition
of
new
habits
the
moral
basis
of
the
intellectual
life
appears
to
be
the
idea
of
discipline
but
the
discipline
is
of
a
very
peculiar
kind
and
varies
with
every
individual
people
of
original
power
have
to
discover
the
original
discipline
that
they
need
they
pass
their
lives
in
thoughtfully
altering
this
private
rule
of
conduct
as
their
needs
alter
as
the
legislature
of
a
progressive
state
makes
unceasing
alterations
in
its
laws
when
we
look
back
upon
the
years
that
are
gone
this
is
our
bitterest
regret
that
whilst
the
precious
time
the
irrecoverable
was
passing
by
so
rapidly
we
were
intellectually
too
undisciplined
to
make
the
best
personal
use
of
all
the
opportunities
that
it
brought
those
men
may
be
truly
esteemed
happy
and
fortunate
who
can
say
to
themselves
in
the
evening
of
their
days
i
had
so
prepared
myself
for
every
successive
enterprise
that
when
the
time
came
for
it
to
be
carried
into
execution
my
training
ensured
success
i
had
thought
of
some
examples
and
there
are
several
great
men
who
have
left
us
noble
examples
of
but
in
the
range
and
completeness
of
that
discipline
in
the
foresight
to
discern
what
would
be
wanted
in
the
humility
to
perceive
that
it
was
wanting
in
the
resolution
that
it
should
be
wanting
when
the
time
came
that
such
knowledge
or
faculty
should
be
called
for
one
colossal
figure
so
far
excels
all
others
that
i
can
not
write
down
their
names
with
that
of
alexander
humboldt
the
world
sees
the
intellectual
greatness
of
such
a
man
but
does
not
see
the
substantial
moral
basis
on
which
the
towering
structure
rose
when
i
think
of
his
noble
dissatisfaction
with
what
he
knew
his
ceaseless
eagerness
to
know
more
and
know
it
better
of
the
rare
combination
of
teachableness
that
despised
no
help
for
he
accepted
without
jealousy
the
aid
of
everybody
who
could
assist
him
with
that
kept
him
always
calm
and
observant
in
the
midst
of
personal
danger
i
know
not
which
is
the
more
magnificent
spectacle
the
splendor
of
intellectual
light
or
the
beauty
and
solidity
of
the
moral
constitution
that
sustained
it
letter
iii
to
a
friend
who
suggested
the
speculation
which
of
the
moral
virtues
was
most
essential
to
the
intellectual
life
the
most
essential
virtue
is
disinterestedness
the
other
virtues
possessed
by
the
opponents
of
intellectual
liberty
the
ultramontane
party
difficulty
of
thinking
disinterestedly
even
about
the
affairs
of
another
nation
english
newspapers
do
not
write
disinterestedly
about
foreign
affairs
difficulty
of
disinterestedness
in
recent
history
poets
and
their
readers
feel
it
fine
subjects
for
poetry
in
recent
events
not
yet
available
even
history
of
past
times
rarely
disinterested
advantages
of
the
study
of
the
dead
languages
in
this
respect
physicians
do
not
trust
their
own
judgment
about
their
personal
health
the
virtue
consists
in
endeavoring
to
be
disinterested
i
think
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
that
the
most
essential
virtue
is
disinterestedness
let
me
tell
you
after
this
decided
answer
what
are
the
considerations
which
have
led
me
to
it
i
began
by
taking
the
other
important
virtues
one
by
one
industry
perseverance
courage
discipline
humility
and
the
rest
and
then
asked
myself
whether
any
class
of
persons
possessed
and
cultivated
these
virtues
who
were
nevertheless
opposed
to
intellectual
liberty
the
answer
came
immediately
that
there
have
in
every
age
been
men
deservedly
respected
for
these
virtues
who
did
all
in
their
power
to
repress
the
free
action
of
the
intellect
what
is
called
the
ultramontane
party
in
the
present
day
includes
great
numbers
of
talented
adherents
who
are
most
industrious
most
persevering
who
willingly
submit
to
the
severest
discipline
who
are
learned
and
humble
enough
to
accept
the
most
obscure
and
duties
some
of
these
men
possess
of
the
qualifications
that
are
necessary
to
the
highest
intellectual
life
they
have
brilliant
gifts
of
nature
they
are
they
take
a
delight
in
the
exercise
of
noble
faculties
and
yet
instead
of
employing
their
time
and
talents
to
help
the
intellectual
advancement
of
mankind
they
do
all
in
their
power
to
retard
it
they
have
many
most
respectable
virtues
but
one
is
wanting
they
have
industry
perseverance
discipline
but
they
have
disinterestedness
i
do
not
mean
disinterestedness
in
its
ordinary
sense
as
the
absence
of
selfish
care
about
money
the
church
of
rome
has
thousands
of
devoted
servants
who
are
content
to
labor
in
her
cause
for
stipends
so
miserable
that
it
is
clear
they
have
no
selfish
aim
whilst
they
abandon
all
those
possibilities
of
fortune
which
exist
for
every
active
and
enterprising
layman
but
their
thinking
can
never
be
disinterested
so
long
as
their
ruling
motive
is
devotion
to
the
interests
of
their
church
some
of
them
are
personally
known
to
me
and
we
have
discussed
together
many
of
the
greatest
questions
which
agitate
the
continental
nations
at
the
present
time
they
have
plenty
of
intellectual
acumen
but
whenever
the
discussion
touches
however
remotely
the
ecclesiastical
interests
that
are
dear
to
them
they
cease
to
be
observers
they
become
passionate
advocates
it
is
this
habit
of
advocacy
which
debars
them
from
all
elevated
speculation
about
the
future
of
the
human
race
and
which
so
often
induces
them
to
take
a
side
with
incapable
and
retrograde
governments
too
willingly
overlooking
their
deficiencies
in
the
expectation
of
services
to
the
cause
their
predecessors
have
impeded
as
far
as
they
were
able
the
early
growth
of
science
not
for
intellectual
reasons
but
because
they
instinctively
felt
that
there
was
something
in
the
scientific
spirit
not
favorable
to
those
interests
which
they
placed
far
above
the
knowledge
of
mere
matter
i
have
selected
the
ultramontane
party
in
the
church
of
rome
as
the
most
prominent
example
of
a
party
eminent
for
many
intellectual
virtues
and
yet
opposed
to
the
intellectual
life
from
its
own
want
of
disinterestedness
but
the
same
defect
exists
to
some
degree
in
every
partisan
exists
in
you
and
me
so
far
as
we
are
partisans
let
us
suppose
for
example
that
we
desired
to
find
out
the
truth
about
a
question
much
agitated
in
a
neighboring
country
at
the
present
time
the
question
whether
it
would
be
better
for
that
country
to
attempt
the
restoration
of
its
ancient
monarchy
or
to
try
to
consolidate
a
republican
form
of
government
how
difficult
it
is
to
think
out
such
a
problem
disinterestedly
and
yet
how
necessary
to
the
justice
of
our
conclusions
that
we
should
think
disinterestedly
if
we
pretend
to
think
at
all
it
is
true
that
we
have
one
circumstance
in
our
favor
we
are
not
french
subjects
and
this
is
much
still
we
are
not
disinterested
since
we
know
that
the
settlement
of
a
great
political
problem
such
as
this
even
though
on
foreign
soil
can
not
fail
to
have
a
powerful
influence
on
opinion
in
our
own
country
and
consequently
upon
the
institutions
of
our
native
land
we
are
spectators
only
it
is
true
but
we
are
far
from
being
disinterested
spectators
and
if
you
desire
to
measure
the
exact
degree
to
which
we
are
interested
in
the
result
you
need
only
look
at
the
newspapers
the
english
newspapers
always
treat
french
affairs
from
the
standpoint
of
their
own
party
the
conservative
journalist
in
england
is
a
monarchist
in
france
and
has
no
hopes
for
the
republic
the
liberal
journalist
in
england
believes
that
the
french
dynasties
are
used
up
and
sees
no
chance
of
tranquillity
outside
of
republican
institutions
in
both
cases
there
is
an
impediment
to
the
intellectual
appreciation
of
the
problem
this
difficulty
is
so
strongly
felt
by
those
who
write
and
read
the
sort
of
literature
which
aspires
to
permanence
and
which
therefore
ought
to
have
a
substantial
intellectual
basis
that
either
our
distinguished
poets
choose
their
subjects
in
actions
long
past
and
or
else
when
tempted
by
present
excitement
they
produce
work
which
is
artistically
far
inferior
to
their
best
our
own
generation
has
witnessed
three
remarkable
events
which
are
poetical
in
the
highest
degree
the
conquest
of
the
two
sicilies
by
garibaldi
is
a
most
perfect
subject
for
a
heroic
poem
the
events
which
led
to
the
execution
of
the
emperor
maximilian
and
deprived
his
empress
of
reason
would
in
the
hands
of
a
great
dramatist
afford
the
finest
possible
material
for
a
tragedy
the
invasion
of
france
by
the
germans
the
overthrow
of
napoleon
the
siege
of
paris
are
an
epic
ready
to
hand
that
only
awaits
its
homer
yet
with
the
exception
of
victor
hugo
who
is
far
gone
in
intellectual
decadence
no
great
poet
has
sung
of
these
things
yet
the
subjects
are
as
good
as
can
be
but
too
near
neither
poet
nor
reader
is
disinterested
enough
for
the
intellectual
enjoyment
of
these
subjects
the
poet
would
not
see
his
way
clearly
the
reader
would
not
follow
unreservedly
it
may
be
added
however
in
this
connection
that
even
past
history
is
hardly
ever
written
disinterestedly
historians
write
with
one
eye
on
the
past
and
the
other
on
the
of
the
present
so
far
as
they
do
this
they
fall
short
of
the
intellectual
standard
an
ideally
perfect
history
would
tell
the
pure
truth
and
all
the
truth
so
far
as
it
was
ascertainable
artists
are
seldom
good
critics
of
art
because
their
own
practice
biasses
them
and
they
are
not
disinterested
the
few
artists
who
have
written
soundly
about
art
have
succeeded
in
the
difficult
task
of
detaching
saying
from
doing
they
have
in
fact
become
two
distinct
persons
each
oblivious
of
the
other
the
strongest
of
all
the
reasons
in
favor
of
the
study
of
the
dead
languages
and
the
literatures
preserved
in
them
has
always
appeared
to
me
to
consist
in
the
more
perfect
disinterestedness
with
which
we
moderns
can
approach
them
the
men
and
events
are
separated
from
us
by
so
wide
an
interval
not
only
of
time
and
locality
but
especially
of
modes
of
thought
that
our
passions
are
not
often
enlisted
and
the
intellect
is
sufficiently
free
it
may
be
noted
that
medical
men
who
are
a
scientific
class
and
therefore
more
than
commonly
aware
of
the
great
importance
of
disinterestedness
in
intellectual
action
never
trust
their
own
judgment
when
they
feel
the
approaches
of
disease
they
know
that
it
is
difficult
for
a
man
however
learned
in
medicine
to
arrive
at
accurate
conclusions
about
the
state
of
a
human
body
that
concerns
him
so
nearly
as
his
own
even
although
the
person
who
suffers
has
the
advantage
of
actually
experiencing
the
morbid
sensations
to
all
this
you
may
answer
that
intellectual
disinterestedness
seems
more
an
accident
of
situation
than
a
virtue
the
virtue
is
not
to
have
it
but
to
seek
it
in
all
earnestness
to
be
ready
to
accept
the
truth
even
when
it
is
most
unfavorable
to
ourselves
i
can
illustrate
my
meaning
by
a
reference
to
a
matter
of
everyday
experience
there
are
people
who
can
not
bear
to
look
into
their
own
accounts
from
a
dread
that
the
clear
revelation
of
figures
may
be
less
agreeable
to
them
than
the
illusions
which
they
cherish
there
are
others
who
possess
a
kind
of
virtue
which
enables
them
to
see
their
own
affairs
as
clearly
as
if
they
had
no
personal
interest
in
them
the
weakness
of
the
first
is
one
of
the
most
fatal
of
intellectual
weaknesses
the
mental
independence
of
the
second
is
one
of
the
most
desirable
of
intellectual
qualities
the
endeavor
to
attain
it
or
to
strengthen
it
is
a
great
virtue
and
of
all
the
virtues
the
one
most
indispensable
to
the
nobility
of
the
intellectual
life
the
reader
may
feel
some
surprise
that
i
have
not
mentioned
honesty
as
an
important
intellectual
virtue
honesty
is
of
great
importance
no
doubt
but
it
appears
to
be
as
to
practical
effects
included
in
disinterestedness
and
to
be
less
comprehensively
useful
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
the
honesty
of
many
political
and
theological
partisans
yet
their
honesty
does
not
preserve
them
from
the
worst
intellectual
habits
such
as
the
habit
of
begging
the
question
of
misrepresenting
the
arguments
on
the
opposite
side
of
shutting
their
eyes
to
every
fact
which
is
not
perfectly
agreeable
to
them
the
truth
is
that
mere
honesty
though
a
most
respectable
and
necessary
virtue
goes
a
very
little
way
toward
the
forming
of
an
effective
intellectual
character
it
is
valuable
rather
in
the
relations
of
the
intellectual
man
to
the
outer
world
around
him
and
even
here
it
is
dangerous
unless
tempered
by
discretion
a
perfect
disinterestedness
would
ensure
the
best
effects
of
honesty
and
yet
avoid
some
serious
evils
against
which
honesty
is
not
in
itself
a
safeguard

moral

the

at
the
same
time
the
most
moral
that
men
of
high
intellectual
aims
have
an
especially
strong
reason
for
morality
opinion
a
critic
in
one
of
the
quarterlies
once
treated
me
as
a
feeble
defender
of
my
opinions
because
i
gave
due
consideration
to
both
sides
of
a
question
he
said
that
like
a
wise
commander
i
capitulated
beforehand
in
case
my
arguments
did
not
come
up
for
my
relief
nay
more
that
i
gave
up
my
arms
in
unconditional
surrender
to
this
let
me
answer
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
polemical
method
that
i
do
not
look
upon
an
opponent
as
an
enemy
to
be
repelled
but
as
a
to
be
welcomed
for
any
light
that
he
may
bring
that
i
defend
nothing
but
try
to
explore
everything
that
lies
near
enough
you
need
not
expect
me
therefore
to
defend
very
vigorously
the
morality
of
the
intellectual
life
an
advocate
could
do
it
brilliantly
there
are
plenty
of
materials
but
so
clumsy
an
advocate
as
your
present
correspondent
would
damage
the
best
of
causes
by
unseasonable
indiscretions
so
i
begin
by
admitting
that
your
accusations
are
most
of
them
well
founded
many
intellectual
people
have
led
immoral
lives
others
have
led
lives
which
although
in
strict
conformity
to
their
own
theories
of
morality
were
in
opposition
to
the
morality
of
their
country
and
their
age
byron
is
a
good
instance
of
the
first
and
shelley
of
the
second
byron
was
really
and
knowingly
immoral
shelley
on
the
other
hand
hated
what
he
considered
to
be
immorality
and
lived
a
life
as
nearly
as
possible
in
accordance
with
the
moral
ideal
in
his
own
conscience
still
he
did
not
respect
the
moral
rule
of
his
country
but
lived
with
mary
godwin
whilst
harriet
his
first
wife
was
still
alive
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
the
two
cases
yet
both
have
the
defect
that
the
person
takes
in
hand
the
regulation
of
his
own
morality
which
it
is
hardly
safe
for
any
one
to
do
considering
the
prodigious
force
of
passion
i
find
even
in
the
lives
of
intellectual
people
a
peculiar
temptation
to
immorality
from
which
others
are
exempt
it
is
in
their
nature
to
feel
an
eager
desire
for
intellectual
companionship
and
yet
at
the
same
time
to
exhaust
very
rapidly
whatever
is
congenial
to
them
in
the
intellect
of
their
friends
they
feel
a
strong
intellectual
attraction
to
persons
of
the
opposite
sex
and
the
idea
of
living
with
a
person
whose
conversation
is
believed
at
the
time
to
promise
an
increasing
interest
is
attractive
in
ways
of
which
those
who
have
no
such
wants
can
scarcely
form
a
conception
a
most
distinguished
foreign
writer
of
the
female
sex
has
made
a
succession
of
domestic
arrangements
which
if
generally
imitated
by
others
would
be
subversive
of
any
conceivable
system
of
morality
and
yet
it
is
clear
in
this
case
that
the
temptation
was
chiefly
if
not
entirely
intellectual
the
successive
companions
of
this
remarkable
woman
were
all
of
them
men
of
exceptional
intellectual
power
and
her
motive
for
changing
them
was
an
unbridled
intellectual
curiosity
this
is
the
sort
of
immorality
to
which
cultivated
people
are
most
exposed
it
is
dangerous
to
the
of
a
community
because
it
destroys
the
sense
of
security
on
which
the
idea
of
the
family
is
founded
if
we
are
to
leave
our
wives
when
their
conversation
ceases
to
be
interesting
the
foundations
of
the
home
will
be
unsafe
if
they
are
to
abandon
us
when
we
are
dull
to
go
away
with
some
livelier
and
more
talkative
companion
can
we
ever
hope
to
retain
them
permanently
there
is
another
danger
which
must
be
looked
fairly
in
the
face
when
the
lives
of
men
are
refined
beyond
the
real
needs
of
their
organization
nature
is
very
apt
to
bring
about
the
most
extraordinary
reactions
thus
the
most
exquisitely
delicate
artists
in
literature
and
painting
have
frequently
had
reactions
of
incredible
coarseness
within
the
châteaubriand
of
atala
there
existed
an
obscene
châteaubriand
that
would
burst
forth
occasionally
in
talk
that
no
biographer
could
repeat
i
have
heard
the
same
thing
of
the
sentimental
lamartine
we
know
that
turner
dreamer
of
enchanted
landscapes
took
the
pleasures
of
a
sailor
on
the
spree
a
friend
said
to
me
of
one
of
the
most
exquisite
living
geniuses
you
can
have
no
conception
of
the
coarseness
of
his
tastes
he
associates
with
the
very
lowest
women
and
enjoys
their
rough
brutality
these
cases
only
prove
what
i
have
always
willingly
admitted
that
the
intellectual
life
is
not
free
from
certain
dangers
if
we
lead
it
too
exclusively
intellectual
excesses
by
the
excitement
which
they
communicate
to
the
whole
system
have
a
direct
tendency
to
drive
men
into
other
excesses
and
a
too
great
refinement
in
one
direction
may
produce
degrading
reactions
in
another
still
the
cultivation
of
the
mind
reasonably
pursued
is
on
the
whole
decidedly
favorable
to
morality
and
we
may
easily
understand
that
it
should
be
so
when
we
remember
that
people
have
recourse
to
sensual
indulgences
simply
from
a
desire
for
excitement
whilst
intellectual
pursuits
supply
excitement
of
a
more
innocent
kind
and
in
the
utmost
variety
and
abundance
if
instead
of
taking
a
few
individual
instances
you
broadly
observe
whole
classes
you
will
recognize
the
moral
utility
of
culture
the
most
cultivated
classes
in
our
own
country
are
also
the
most
moral
and
these
classes
have
advanced
in
morality
at
the
same
time
that
they
have
advanced
in
culture
english
gentlemen
of
the
present
day
are
superior
to
their
forefathers
whom
fielding
described
they
are
better
educated
and
they
read
more
they
are
at
the
same
time
both
more
sober
and
more
chaste
i
may
add
that
intellectual
men
have
peculiar
and
most
powerful
reasons
for
avoiding
the
excesses
of
immorality
reasons
which
to
any
one
who
has
a
noble
ambition
are
quite
enough
to
encourage
him
in
those
excesses
are
the
gradual
of
the
intellectual
forces
for
they
weaken
the
spring
of
the
mind
not
leaving
it
well
enough
to
face
the
drudgery
that
is
inevitable
in
every
career
even
in
cases
where
they
do
not
immediately
lead
to
visible
imbecility
they
make
the
man
less
efficient
and
less
capable
than
he
might
have
been
and
all
experienced
wrestlers
with
fate
and
fortune
know
well
that
success
has
often
at
the
critical
time
depended
upon
some
very
trifling
advantage
which
the
slightest
diminution
of
power
would
have
lost
to
them
no
one
knows
the
full
immensity
of
the
difference
between
having
power
enough
to
make
a
little
headway
against
obstacles
and
just
falling
short
of
the
power
which
is
necessary
at
the
time
in
every
great
intellectual
career
there
are
situations
like
that
of
a
steamer
with
a
directly
against
her
and
an
coast
behind
if
the
engines
are
strong
enough
to
gain
an
inch
an
hour
she
is
safe
but
if
they
lose
there
is
no
hope
intellectual
successes
are
so
rewarding
that
they
are
worth
any
sacrifice
of
pleasure
the
sense
of
defeat
is
so
humiliating
that
fair
venus
herself
could
not
offer
a
consolation
for
it
an
ambitious
man
will
govern
himself
for
the
sake
of
his
ambition
and
withstand
the
seductions
of
the
senses
can
he
be
ever
strong
enough
can
his
brain
ever
be
lucid
enough
for
the
immensity
of
the
task
before
him

franz

goethe
hebrew
proverb
i
happened
one
day
to
converse
with
an
excellent
french
cook
about
the
delicate
art
which
he
professed
and
he
comprised
the
whole
of
it
under
two
heads
the
knowledge
of
the
mutual
influences
of
ingredients
and
the
judicious
management
of
heat
it
struck
me
that
there
existed
a
very
close
analogy
between
cookery
and
education
and
on
following
out
the
subject
in
my
own
way
i
found
that
what
he
told
me
suggested
several
considerations
of
the
very
highest
importance
in
the
culture
of
the
human
intellect
amongst
the
dishes
for
which
my
friend
had
a
deserved
reputation
was
a
certain
de
which
had
a
very
exquisite
flavor
the
principal
ingredient
not
in
quantity
hut
in
power
was
the
liver
of
a
fowl
but
there
were
several
other
ingredients
also
and
amongst
these
a
leaf
or
two
of
parsley
he
told
me
that
the
influence
of
the
parsley
was
a
good
illustration
of
his
theory
about
his
art
if
the
parsley
were
omitted
the
flavor
he
aimed
at
was
not
produced
at
all
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
quantity
of
parsley
was
in
the
least
excessive
then
the
instead
of
being
a
delicacy
for
became
an
uneatable
mess
perceiving
that
i
was
really
interested
in
the
subject
he
kindly
promised
a
practical
evidence
of
his
doctrine
and
the
next
day
intentionally
spoiled
his
dish
by
a
trifling
addition
of
parsley
he
had
not
exaggerated
the
consequences
the
delicate
flavor
entirely
departed
and
left
a
nauseous
bitterness
in
its
place
like
the
remembrance
of
an
youth
and
so
it
is
i
thought
with
the
different
ingredients
of
knowledge
which
are
so
eagerly
and
indiscriminately
recommended
we
are
told
that
we
ought
to
learn
this
thing
and
that
as
if
every
new
ingredient
did
not
affect
the
whole
flavor
of
the
mind
there
is
a
sort
of
intellectual
chemistry
which
is
quite
as
marvellous
as
material
chemistry
and
a
thousand
times
more
difficult
to
observe
one
general
truth
may
however
be
relied
upon
as
surely
and
permanently
our
own
it
is
true
that
everything
we
learn
affects
the
character
of
the
mind
consider
how
incalculably
important
becomes
the
question
of
proportion
in
our
knowledge
and
how
that
which
we
are
is
dependent
as
much
upon
our
ignorance
as
our
science
what
we
call
ignorance
is
only
a
smaller
proportion
what
we
call
science
only
a
larger
the
larger
quantity
is
recommended
as
an
unquestionable
good
but
the
goodness
of
it
is
entirely
dependent
on
the
mental
product
that
we
want
aristocracies
have
always
instinctively
felt
this
and
have
decided
that
a
gentleman
ought
not
to
know
too
much
of
certain
arts
and
sciences
the
character
which
they
had
accepted
as
their
ideal
would
have
been
destroyed
by
indiscriminate
additions
to
those
ingredients
of
which
long
experience
had
fixed
the
exact
proportions
the
same
feeling
is
strong
in
the
various
professions
there
is
an
apprehension
that
the
disproportionate
knowledge
may
destroy
the
professional
nature
the
less
intelligent
members
of
the
profession
will
tell
you
that
they
dread
an
unprofessional
use
of
time
but
the
more
thoughtful
are
not
so
apprehensive
about
hours
and
days
dread
that
sure
transformation
of
the
whole
intellect
which
follows
every
increase
of
knowledge
i
knew
an
english
author
who
by
great
care
and
labor
had
succeeded
in
forming
a
style
which
harmonized
quite
perfectly
with
the
character
of
his
thinking
and
served
as
an
unfailing
means
of
communication
with
his
readers
every
one
recognized
its
simple
ease
and
charm
and
he
might
have
gone
on
writing
with
that
enviable
facility
had
he
not
determined
to
study
locke
philosophical
compositions
shortly
afterwards
my
friend
style
suddenly
lost
its
grace
he
began
to
write
with
difficulty
and
what
he
wrote
was
unpleasantly
difficult
to
read
even
the
thinking
was
no
longer
his
own
thinking
having
been
in
too
close
communication
with
a
writer
who
was
not
a
literary
artist
his
own
art
had
deteriorated
in
consequence
i
could
mention
an
english
landscape
painter
who
diminished
the
pictorial
excellence
of
his
works
by
taking
too
much
interest
in
geology
his
landscapes
became
geological
illustrations
and
no
longer
held
together
pictorially
another
landscape
painter
who
began
by
taking
a
healthy
delight
in
the
beauty
of
natural
scenery
became
morbidly
religious
after
an
illness
and
thenceforth
passed
by
the
loveliest
european
scenery
as
comparatively
unworthy
of
his
attention
to
go
and
make
ugly
pictures
of
places
that
had
sacred
associations
for
people
who
produce
nothing
these
risks
appear
to
be
less
serious
and
yet
there
have
been
admirable
characters
not
productive
whose
admirableness
might
have
been
lessened
by
the
addition
of
certain
kinds
of
learning
the
last
generation
of
the
english
country
aristocracy
was
particularly
rich
in
characters
whose
unity
and
charm
was
dependent
upon
the
limitations
of
their
culture
and
which
would
have
been
entirely
altered
perhaps
not
for
the
better
by
simply
knowing
a
science
or
a
literature
that
was
closed
to
them
abundant
illustrations
might
be
collected
in
evidence
of
the
truth
that
the
burden
of
knowledge
may
diminish
the
energy
of
action
but
this
is
rather
outside
of
what
we
are
considering
which
is
the
influence
of
knowledge
upon
the
intellectual
and
not
the
active
life
i
regret
very
much
not
to
be
able
to
suggest
anything
like
a
safe
rule
for
the
selection
of
our
knowledge
the
most
rational
one
which
has
been
hit
upon
as
yet
appears
to
be
a
simple
confidence
in
the
feeling
that
we
inwardly
want
to
know
if
i
feel
the
inward
want
for
a
certain
kind
of
knowledge
it
may
perhaps
be
presumed
that
it
would
be
good
for
me
but
even
this
feeling
is
not
perfectly
reliable
since
people
are
often
curious
about
things
that
do
not
closely
concern
them
whilst
they
neglect
what
it
is
most
important
for
them
to
ascertain
all
that
i
venture
to
insist
upon
is
that
we
can
not
learn
any
new
thing
without
changing
our
whole
intellectual
composition
as
a
chemical
compound
is
changed
by
another
ingredient
that
the
mere
addition
of
knowledge
may
be
good
for
us
or
bad
for
us
and
that
whether
it
will
be
good
or
bad
is
usually
a
more
obscure
problem
than
the
enthusiasm
of
educators
will
allow
that
depends
entirely
on
the
work
we
have
to
do
men
are
qualified
for
their
work
by
knowledge
but
they
are
also
negatively
qualified
for
it
by
their
ignorance
nature
herself
appears
to
take
care
that
the
workman
shall
not
know
too
much
she
keeps
him
steadily
to
his
task
fixes
him
in
one
place
mentally
if
not
corporeally
and
conquers
his
restlessness
by
fatigue
as
we
are
bound
to
a
little
planet
and
hindered
by
impassable
gulfs
of
space
from
wandering
in
stars
where
we
have
no
business
so
we
are
kept
by
the
force
of
circumstances
to
the
limited
studies
that
belong
to
us
if
we
have
any
kind
of
efficiency
very
much
of
it
is
owing
to
our
narrowness
which
is
favorable
to
a
powerful
individuality
sometimes
it
is
true
we
meet
with
instances
of
men
remarkable
for
the
extent
of
their
studies
franz
woepke
who
died
in
was
an
extraordinary
example
of
this
kind
in
the
course
of
a
short
life
he
became
although
unknown
a
prodigy
of
various
learning
his
friend
taine
says
that
he
was
erudite
in
many
eruditions
his
favorite
pursuit
was
the
history
of
mathematics
but
as
auxiliaries
he
had
learned
arabic
and
persian
and
sanskrit
he
was
classically
educated
he
wrote
and
spoke
the
principal
modern
languages
easily
and
correctly
his
printed
works
are
in
three
languages
he
had
lived
in
several
nations
and
known
their
leading
men
of
science
and
yet
this
astonishing
list
of
acquirements
may
be
reduced
to
the
exercise
of
two
decided
and
natural
tastes
franz
woepke
had
the
gift
of
the
linguist
and
an
interest
in
mathematics
the
first
serving
as
auxiliary
to
the
second
goethe
said
that
a
vast
abundance
of
objects
must
lie
before
us
ere
we
can
think
upon
them
woepke
felt
the
need
of
this
abundance
but
he
did
not
go
out
of
his
way
to
find
it
the
objectionable
seeking
after
knowledge
is
the
seeking
after
the
knowledge
which
does
not
belong
to
us
in
vain
you
urge
me
to
go
in
quest
of
sciences
for
which
i
have
no
natural
aptitude
would
you
have
me
act
like
that
foolish
camel
in
the
hebrew
proverb
which
in
going
to
seek
horns
lost
his
ears

through
neglect
what
it
really
is
the
only
available
knowledge
that
which
we
habitually
use
difficulty
in
modern
education
that
it
is
inevitably
a
beginning
of
many
things
and
no
more
the
simpler
education
of
an
ancient
greek
that
of
alcibiades
how
the
romans
were
situated
as
to
this
the
privilege
of
limited
studies
belongs
to
the
earlier
ages
they
learned
and
we
attempt
to
learn
it
appears
to
be
henceforth
inevitable
that
men
should
be
unable
to
restrict
themselves
to
one
or
two
pursuits
and
you
who
are
in
most
respects
a
very
perfect
specimen
of
what
the
age
naturally
produces
in
the
way
of
culture
have
studied
subjects
so
many
and
so
various
that
a
mere
catalogue
of
them
would
astonish
your
grandfather
if
his
shade
could
revisit
his
old
home
and
yet
your
grandfather
was
considered
a
very
highly
cultivated
gentleman
according
to
the
ideas
and
requirements
of
his
time
he
was
an
elegant
scholar
but
in
latin
chiefly
for
he
said
that
he
never
read
greek
easily
and
indeed
he
abandoned
that
language
entirely
on
leaving
the
university
but
his
latin
from
daily
use
and
practice
for
he
let
no
day
slip
by
without
reading
some
ancient
author
and
from
the
thoroughness
and
accuracy
of
his
scholarship
was
always
as
ready
for
service
as
the
saddled
steeds
of
branksome
i
think
he
got
more
culture
more
of
the
best
effects
of
good
literature
out
of
that
one
language
than
some
polyglots
get
out
of
a
dozen
he
knew
no
modern
tongue
he
had
not
even
the
common
pretension
to
read
a
little
french
and
in
his
day
hardly
anybody
studied
german
he
had
no
scientific
training
of
any
kind
except
mathematics
in
which
i
have
heard
him
say
that
he
had
never
been
proficient
of
the
fine
arts
his
ignorance
was
complete
so
complete
that
i
doubt
if
he
could
have
distinguished
rigaud
from
reynolds
and
he
had
never
played
upon
any
musical
instrument
the
leisure
which
he
enjoyed
during
a
long
and
tranquil
existence
he
gave
entirely
to
latin
and
english
literature
but
of
the
two
he
enjoyed
latin
the
more
not
with
the
preference
of
a
pedant
but
because
it
carried
him
more
completely
out
of
the
present
and
gave
him
the
refreshment
of
a
more
perfect
change
he
produced
on
all
who
knew
him
the
impression
of
a
cultivated
gentleman
which
he
was
there
is
only
an
interval
of
one
generation
between
you
and
that
good
latinist
but
how
wide
is
the
difference
in
your
intellectual
regimen
you
have
studied
well
here
is
a
little
list
of
what
you
have
studied
and
probably
even
this
is
not
complete
greek
latin
french
german
italian
mathematics
chemistry
mineralogy
geology
botany
the
theory
of
music
the
practice
of
music
on
two
instruments
much
theory
about
painting
the
practice
of
painting
in
oil
and
photography
etching
on
copper
etc
that
is
to
say
six
literatures
including
english
six
sciences
counting
mineralogy
and
geology
as
one
and
five
branches
or
departments
of
the
fine
arts
omitting
english
literature
from
our
total
as
that
may
be
considered
to
come
by
nature
to
an
englishman
though
any
real
proficiency
in
it
costs
the
leisure
of
years
we
have
here
no
less
than
sixteen
different
pursuits
if
you
like
to
merge
the
theory
of
music
and
painting
in
the
practice
of
those
arts
though
as
a
branch
of
study
the
theory
is
really
distinct
we
have
still
fourteen
pursuits
any
one
of
which
is
enough
to
occupy
the
whole
of
one
man
time
if
you
gave
some
time
daily
to
each
of
these
pursuits
you
could
scarcely
give
more
than
half
an
hour
even
supposing
that
you
had
no
professional
occupation
and
that
you
had
no
favorite
study
absorbing
time
to
the
detriment
of
the
rest
now
your
grandfather
though
he
would
be
considered
quite
an
ignorant
country
gentleman
in
these
days
had
in
reality
certain
intellectual
advantages
over
his
more
accomplished
descendant
in
the
first
place
he
entirely
escaped
the
sense
of
pressure
the
feeling
of
not
having
time
enough
to
do
what
he
wanted
to
do
he
accumulated
his
learning
as
quietly
as
a
stout
lady
accumulates
her
fat
by
the
daily
satisfaction
of
his
appetite
and
at
the
same
time
that
he
escaped
the
sense
of
pressure
he
escaped
also
the
miserable
sense
of
imperfection
of
course
he
did
not
know
latin
like
an
ancient
roman
but
then
he
never
met
with
any
ancient
romans
to
humiliate
him
by
too
rapid
and
conversation
he
met
the
best
latinists
of
his
day
and
felt
himself
a
master
amongst
masters
every
time
he
went
into
his
study
to
pass
delightful
hours
with
the
noble
authors
that
he
loved
he
knew
that
his
admission
into
that
august
society
would
be
immediate
and
complete
he
had
to
wait
in
no
antechamber
of
mere
linguistic
difficulty
but
passed
at
once
into
the
atmosphere
of
ancient
thought
and
breathed
its
delicate
perfume
in
this
great
privilege
of
instant
admission
the
man
of
one
study
has
always
the
advantage
of
men
more
variously
cultivated
their
misfortune
is
to
be
perpetually
waiting
in
antechambers
and
losing
time
in
them
grammars
and
dictionaries
are
antechambers
bad
drawing
and
bad
coloring
are
antechambers
musical
practice
with
imperfect
intonation
is
an
antechamber
and
the
worst
is
that
even
when
a
man
like
yourself
for
instance
of
very
various
culture
has
at
one
time
fairly
penetrated
beyond
the
antechamber
he
is
not
sure
of
admittance
a
year
hence
because
in
the
mean
time
the
door
may
have
been
closed
against
him
the
rule
of
each
separate
hall
or
saloon
of
knowledge
is
that
he
alone
is
to
be
instantly
admitted
who
calls
there
every
day
the
man
of
various
pursuits
does
not
in
any
case
keep
them
up
simultaneously
he
is
led
by
inclination
or
compelled
by
necessity
to
give
predominance
to
one
or
another
if
you
have
fifteen
different
pursuits
ten
of
them
at
any
given
time
will
be
lying
by
neglected
the
metaphor
commonly
used
in
reference
to
neglected
pursuits
is
borrowed
from
the
oxidation
of
metal
it
is
said
that
they
become
rusty
this
metaphor
is
too
mild
to
be
exact
rust
on
metal
even
on
polished
steel
is
easily
guarded
against
by
care
and
a
gun
or
a
knife
does
not
need
to
be
constantly
used
to
keep
it
from
being
pitted
the
gunsmith
and
the
cutler
know
how
to
keep
these
things
in
great
quantity
without
using
them
at
all
but
no
one
can
retain
knowledge
without
using
it
the
metaphor
fails
still
more
seriously
in
perpetuating
a
false
conception
of
the
deterioration
of
knowledge
through
neglect
it
is
not
simply
a
loss
of
polish
which
takes
place
not
a
loss
of
mere
but
absolute
disorganization
like
the
disorganization
of
a
carriage
when
the
is
taken
away
a
rusty
thing
may
still
be
used
but
a
disorganized
thing
can
not
be
used
until
the
lost
organ
has
been
replaced
there
is
no
equivalent
amongst
ordinary
material
losses
to
the
intellectual
loss
that
we
incur
by
ceasing
from
a
pursuit
but
we
may
consider
neglect
as
an
enemy
who
carries
away
the
girths
from
our
saddles
the
bits
from
our
bridles
the
oars
from
our
boats
and
one
wheel
from
each
of
our
carriages
leaving
us
indeed
still
nominally
possessors
of
all
these
aids
to
locomotion
but
practically
in
the
same
position
as
if
we
were
entirely
without
them
and
as
an
enemy
counts
upon
the
delays
caused
by
these
vexations
to
execute
his
designs
whilst
we
are
helpless
so
whilst
we
are
laboring
to
replace
the
lost
parts
of
our
knowledge
the
occasion
slips
by
when
we
most
need
it
the
only
knowledge
which
is
available
when
it
is
wanted
is
that
which
we
habitually
use
studies
which
from
their
nature
can
not
be
commonly
used
are
always
retained
with
great
difficulty
the
study
of
anatomy
is
perhaps
the
best
instance
of
this
every
one
who
has
attempted
it
knows
with
what
difficulty
it
is
kept
by
the
memory
anatomists
say
that
it
has
to
be
learned
and
forgotten
six
times
before
it
can
be
counted
as
a
possession
this
is
because
anatomy
lies
so
much
outside
of
what
is
needed
for
ordinary
life
that
very
few
people
are
ever
called
upon
to
use
it
except
during
the
hours
when
they
are
actually
studying
it
the
few
who
need
it
every
day
remember
is
as
easily
as
a
man
remembers
the
language
of
the
country
which
he
inhabits
the
workmen
in
the
establishment
at
saint
aubin
where
auzoux
manufactures
his
wonderful
anatomical
models
are
as
familiar
with
anatomy
as
a
painter
is
with
the
colors
on
his
palette
never
forget
it
knowledge
is
never
made
practically
valueless
by
some
yawning
hiatus
causing
temporary
incompetence
and
delay
to
have
one
favorite
study
and
live
in
it
with
happy
familiarity
and
cultivate
every
portion
of
it
diligently
and
lovingly
as
a
small
yeoman
proprietor
cultivates
his
own
land
this
as
to
study
at
least
is
the
most
enviable
intellectual
life
but
there
is
another
side
to
the
question
which
has
to
be
considered
the
first
difficulty
for
us
is
in
our
education
modern
education
is
a
beginning
of
many
things
and
it
is
little
more
than
a
beginning
my
notion
of
educating
my
boy
said
a
rich
englishman
is
not
to
make
him
particularly
clever
at
anything
during
his
minority
but
to
make
him
overcome
the
rudimentary
difficulties
of
many
things
so
that
when
he
selects
for
himself
his
own
line
of
culture
in
the
future
it
can
not
be
altogether
strange
to
him
whatever
line
he
may
happen
to
select
a
modern
father
usually
allows
his
son
to
learn
many
things
from
a
feeling
of
timidity
about
making
a
choice
if
only
one
thing
had
to
be
chosen
he
might
so
easily
make
a
wrong
choice
when
the
inheritance
of
the
human
race
was
less
rich
there
was
no
embarrassment
of
that
kind
look
at
the
education
of
an
ancient
greek
at
the
education
of
one
of
the
most
celebrated
athenians
a
man
living
in
the
most
refined
and
intellectual
society
himself
mentally
and
bodily
the
perfect
type
of
his
splendid
race
an
eloquent
and
powerful
speaker
a
most
capable
commander
both
by
sea
and
land
look
at
the
education
of
the
brilliant
alcibiades
when
socrates
gave
the
list
of
the
things
that
alcibiades
had
learned
alcibiades
could
add
to
it
no
other
even
nominal
accomplishment
and
what
a
meagre
short
catalogue
it
was
but
indeed
i
also
pretty
accurately
know
what
thou
hast
learned
thou
wilt
tell
me
if
anything
has
escaped
my
notice
thou
hast
learned
then
thy
letters
greek
grammata
to
play
on
the
cithara
greek
kitharizein
and
to
wrestle
greek
palaiein
for
thou
hast
not
cared
to
learn
to
play
upon
the
flute
this
is
all
that
thou
hast
learned
unless
something
has
escaped
me
the
greek
grammata
which
alcibiades
had
learned
with
a
master
meant
reading
and
writing
for
he
expressly
says
later
on
that
as
for
speaking
greek
greek
hellênizein
he
learned
that
of
no
other
master
than
the
people
an
english
education
equivalent
to
that
of
alcibiades
would
therefore
consist
of
reading
and
writing
wrestling
and
the
last
accomplishment
being
limited
to
very
simple
music
such
an
education
was
possible
to
an
athenian
though
it
is
fair
to
add
that
socrates
does
not
seem
to
have
thought
much
of
it
because
a
man
situated
as
alcibiades
was
situated
in
the
intellectual
history
of
the
world
had
no
past
behind
him
which
deserved
his
attention
more
than
the
present
which
surrounded
him
simply
to
speak
greek
greek
hellênizein
was
really
then
the
most
precious
of
all
accomplishments
and
the
fact
that
alcibiades
came
by
it
easily
does
not
lessen
its
value
amongst
a
people
like
the
athenians
fond
of
intellectual
talk
conversation
was
one
of
the
best
and
readiest
means
of
informing
the
mind
and
certainly
the
very
best
means
of
developing
it
it
was
not
a
slight
advantage
to
speak
the
language
of
socrates
and
have
him
for
a
companion
the
cleverest
and
most
accomplished
romans
were
situated
rather
more
like
ourselves
or
at
least
as
we
should
be
situated
if
we
had
not
to
learn
latin
and
greek
and
if
there
were
no
modern
language
worth
studying
except
french
they
went
to
greece
to
perfect
themselves
in
greek
and
improve
their
accent
just
as
our
young
gentlemen
go
to
paris
or
touraine
still
the
burden
of
the
past
was
comparatively
light
upon
their
shoulders
an
englishman
who
had
attempted
no
more
than
they
were
bound
to
attempt
might
be
a
scholar
but
he
would
not
be
considered
so
he
might
be
a
thorough
scholar
in
french
and
english
that
is
he
might
possess
the
cream
of
two
great
literatures
but
he
would
be
spoken
of
as
a
person
of
defective
education
it
is
the
fashion
for
example
to
speak
of
sir
walter
scott
as
a
man
because
he
did
not
know
much
greek
yet
sir
walter
had
studied
german
with
success
and
with
his
habit
of
extensive
reading
and
his
immense
memory
certainly
knew
incomparably
more
about
the
generations
which
preceded
him
than
horace
knew
of
those
which
preceded
the
augustan
era
the
privilege
of
limiting
their
studies
from
the
beginning
to
one
or
two
branches
of
knowledge

to
earlier
ages
and
every
successive
accumulation
of
the
world
knowledge
has
gradually
lessened
it
schoolboys
in
our
time
are
expected
to
know
more
or
to
have
attempted
to
learn
more
than
the
most
brilliant
intellectual
leaders
of
former
times
what
english
parent
in
easy
circumstances
would
be
content
that
his
son
should
have
the
education
of
alcibiades
or
an
education
accurately
corresponding
to
that
of
horace
or
to
that
which
sufficed
for
shakespeare
yet
although
the
burdens
laid
upon
the
memory
have
been
steadily
augmented
its
powers
have
not
increased
our
brains
are
not
better
constituted
than
those
of
our
forefathers
although
where
they
learned
one
thing
we
attempt
to
learn
six
they
learned
and
we
attempt
to
learn
the
only
hope
for
us
is
to
make
a
selection
from
the
attempts
of
our
too
heavily
burdened
youth

in
those
selected

in
your
answer
to
my
letter
about
the
multiplicity
of
modern
studies
you
tell
me
that
my
portrait
of
your
grandfather
is
considerably
idealized
and
that
notwithstanding
all
the
respect
which
you
owe
to
his
memory
you
have
convincing
proof
in
his
manuscript
annotations
to
latin
authors
that
his
scholarship
can
not
have
been
quite
so
thorough
as
i
represented
it
you
convey
moreover
though
with
perfect
modesty
in
form
the
idea
that
you
believe
your
own
latin
superior
to
your
grandfather
notwithstanding
the
far
greater
variety
of
your
studies
let
me
confess
that
i
somewhat
idealize
that
description
of
your
intellectual
life
i
described
rather
a
life
which
might
have
been
than
a
life
which
actually
was
and
even
this
might
have
been
is
problematical
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
modern
has
ever
really
mastered
latin
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
a
man
situated
like
your
grandfather
without
a
profession
without
our
present
temptation
to
scatter
effort
in
many
pursuits
and
who
made
latin
scholarship
his
unique
intellectual
purpose
would
probably
go
nearer
to
a
satisfactory
degree
of
attainment
than
we
whose
time
and
strength
have
been
divided
into
so
many
fragments
but
the
picture
of
a
perfect
modern
latinist
is
purely
ideal
and
the
prevalent
notion
of
high
attainment
in
a
dead
language
is
not
fixed
enough
to
be
a
standard
whilst
if
it
were
fixed
it
would
certainly
be
a
very
low
standard
the
scholars
of
this
century
do
not
write
latin
except
as
a
mere
exercise
they
do
not
write
books
in
latin
and
they
never
speak
it
at
all
they
do
not
use
the
language
actively
they
only
read
it
which
is
not
really
using
it
but
only
seeing
how
other
men
have
used
it
there
is
the
same
difference
between
reading
a
language
and
writing
or
speaking
it
that
there
is
between
looking
at
pictures
intelligently
and
painting
them
the
scholars
of
the
sixteenth
century
spoke
latin
habitually
and
wrote
it
with
ease
and
fluency
nicholas
grouchy
says
montaigne
who
wrote
a
book
comitiis
william
guerente
who
has
written
a
commentary
upon
aristotle
george
buchanan
that
great
scotch
poet
and
marc
anthony
muret
whom
both
france
and
italy
have
acknowledged
for
the
best
orator
of
his
time
my
domestic
tutors
at
college
have
all
of
them
often
told
me
that
i
had
in
my
infancy
that
language
so
very
fluent
and
ready
that
they
were
afraid
to
enter
into
discourse
with
me
this
passage
is
interesting
for
two
reasons
it
shows
that
the
scholars
of
that
age
spoke
latin
but
it
proves
at
the
same
time
that
they
can
not
have
been
really
masters
of
the
language
since
they
were
afraid
to
enter
into
discourse
with
a
clever
child
fancy
an
englishman
who
professed
to
be
a
french
scholar
and
yet
was
afraid
to
enter
into
discourse
with
a
french
boy
for
fear
he
should
speak
too
quickly
the
position
of
these
scholars
relatively
to
latin
was
in
fact
too
isolated
for
it
to
have
been
possible
that
they
should
reach
the
point
of
mastery
suppose
a
society
of
frenchmen
in
some
secluded
little
french
village
where
no
englishman
ever
penetrates
and
that
these
frenchmen
learn
english
from
dictionaries
and
set
themselves
to
speak
english
with
each
other
without
anybody
to
teach
them
the
colloquial
language
or
its
pronunciation
without
ever
once
hearing
the
sound
of
it
from
english
lips
what
sort
of
english
would
they
create
amongst
themselves
this
is
a
question
that
i
happen
to
be
able
to
answer
very
accurately
because
i
have
known
two
frenchmen
who
studied
english
literature
just
as
the
frenchmen
of
the
sixteenth
century
studied
the
literature
of
ancient
rome
one
of
them
especially
had
attained
what
would
certainly
in
the
case
of
a
dead
language
be
considered
a
very
high
degree
of
scholarship
indeed
most
of
our
great
authors
were
known
to
him
even
down
to
the
close
critical
comparison
of
different
readings
aided
by
the
most
powerful
memory
i
ever
knew
he
had
amassed
such
stores
that
the
acquisitions
even
of
cultivated
englishmen
would
in
many
cases
have
appeared
inconsiderable
beside
them
but
he
could
not
write
or
speak
english
in
a
manner
tolerable
to
an
englishman
and
although
he
knew
nearly
all
the
words
in
the
language
it
was
dictionary
knowledge
and
so
different
from
an
englishman
apprehension
of
the
same
words
that
it
was
only
a
sort
of
that
he
knew
and
not
our
living
tongue
his
appreciation
of
our
authors
especially
of
our
poets
differed
so
widely
from
english
criticism
and
english
feeling
that
it
was
evident
he
did
not
understand
them
as
we
understand
them
two
things
especially
proved
this
he
frequently
mistook
declamatory
versification
of
the
most
mediocre
quality
for
poetry
of
an
elevated
order
whilst
on
the
other
hand
his
ear
failed
to
perceive
the
music
of
the
musical
poets
as
byron
and
tennyson
how
he
hear
their
music
he
to
whom
our
english
sounds
were
all
unknown
here
for
example
is
the
way
he

this
as
nearly
as
i
have
been
able
to
render
it
in
english
spelling
was
the
way
in
which
a
french
gentleman
of
really
high
culture
was
accustomed
to
read
english
poetry
to
himself
is
it
surprising
that
he
should
have
failed
to
appreciate
the
music
of
our
musical
verse
he
did
not
however
seem
to
be
aware
that
there
existed
any
obstacle
to
the
accuracy
of
his
decisions
but
gave
his
opinion
with
a
good
deal
of
authority
which
might
have
surprised
me
had
i
not
so
frequently
heard
latin
scholars
do
exactly
the
same
thing
my
french
friend
read
claribel
in
a
ridiculous
manner
but
english
scholars
all
read
latin
poetry
in
a
manner
not
less
ridiculous
you
laugh
to
hear
claribel
read
with
a
foreign
pronunciation
and
you
see
at
once
the
absurdity
of
affecting
to
judge
of
it
as
poetry
before
the
reader
has
learned
to
pronounce
the
sounds
but
you
do
not
laugh
to
hear
latin
poetry
read
with
a
foreign
pronunciation
and
you
do
not
perceive
that
we
are
all
of
us
disqualified
by
our
profound
ignorance
of
the
pronunciation
of
the
ancient
romans
for
any
competent
criticism
of
their
verse
in
all
poetry
in
all
oratory
in
much
of
the
best
and
most
artistic
also
sound
has
a
great
influence
upon
sense
a
great
deal
is
conveyed
by
it
especially
in
the
way
of
feeling
if
we
do
not
thoroughly
know
and
practise
the
right
pronunciation
and
by
the
right
pronunciation
i
mean
that
which
the
author
himself
whilst
he
wrote
we
miss
those
delicate
tones
and
cadences
which
are
in
literature
like
the
modulations
of
the
voice
in
speech
nor
can
we
properly
appreciate
the
artistic
choice
of
beautiful
names
for
persons
and
places
unless
we
know
the
sounds
of
them
quite
accurately
and
have
already
in
our
minds
the
associations
belonging
to
the
sounds
names
which
are
selected
with
the
greatest
care
by
our
english
poets
and
which
hold
their
place
like
jewels
on
the
texture
of
the
verse
lose
all
their
value
when
they
are
read
with
a
vicious
foreign
pronunciation
so
it
must
be
with
latin
poetry
when
read
by
an
englishman
and
it
is
probable
that
we
are
really
quite
insensible
to
the
delicate
art
of
verbal
selection
as
it
was
practised
by
the
most
consummate
masters
of
antiquity
i
know
that
scholars
think
that
they
hear
the
roman
music
still
but
this
is
one
of
the
illusions
of
scholarship
in
each
country
latin
scholars
have
adopted
a
conventional
style
of
reading
and
the
sounds
which
are
in
conformity
with
that
style
seem
to
them
to
be
musical
whilst
other
than
the
accepted
sounds
seem
ridiculous
and
grate
harshly
on
the
unaccustomed
ear
the
music
which
the
englishman
hears
or
imagines
that
he
hears
in
the
language
of
ancient
rome
is
certainly
not
the
music
which
the
roman
authors
intended
to
note
in
words
it
is
as
if
my
frenchman
having
read
claribel
in
his
own
way
had
affirmed
that
he
heard
the
music
of
the
verse
if
he
heard
music
at
all
it
was
not
tennyson
permit
me
to
add
a
few
observations
about
sense
my
french
friend
certainly
understood
english
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
for
a
student
who
had
never
visited
our
country
he
knew
the
dictionary
meaning
of
every
word
he
encountered
and
yet
there
ever
remained
between
him
and
our
english
tongue
a
barrier
or
wall
of
separation
hard
to
define
but
easy
to
perceive
in
the
true
deep
sense
he
never
understood
the
language
he
studied
it
laid
regular
siege
to
it
mastered
it
to
all
appearance
yet
remained
to
the
end
outside
of
it
his
observations
and
especially
his
unfavorable
criticisms
proved
this
quite
conclusively
expressions
often
appeared
to
him
faulty
in
which
no
english
reader
would
see
anything
to
remark
upon
it
may
be
added
that
by
way
of
compensation
he
was
unable
to
appreciate
the
oddity
of
those
intentionally
quaint
turns
of
expression
which
are
invented
by
the
craft
of
humorists
it
may
even
be
doubted
whether
his
english
was
of
any
ascertainable
use
to
him
he
might
probably
have
come
as
near
to
an
understanding
of
our
authors
by
the
help
of
translations
and
he
could
not
converse
in
english
for
the
spoken
language
was
entirely
unintelligible
to
him
an
acquisition
of
this
kind
seems
scarcely
an
adequate
reward
for
the
labor
that
it
costs
compared
with
living
englishmen
my
french
friend
was
nowhere
but
if
english
had
been
a
dead
language
he
would
have
been
looked
up
to
as
a
very
eminent
scholar
and
would
have
occupied
a
professor
chair
in
the
university
a
little
more
life
might
be
given
to
the
study
of
latin
by
making
it
a
spoken
language
boys
might
be
taught
to
speak
latin
in
their
schooldays
with
the
modern
roman
pronunciation
which
though
probably
a
deviation
from
the
ancient
is
certainly
nearer
to
it
than
our
own
if
colloquial
latin
were
made
a
subject
of
special
research
it
is
likely
that
a
sufficiently
rich
might
be
constructed
from
the
plays
if
this
plan
were
pursued
throughout
europe
always
adopting
the
roman
pronunciation
all
educated
men
would
possess
a
common
tongue
which
might
be
enriched
to
suit
modern
requirements
without
any
serious
departure
from
classical
construction
the
want
of
such
a
system
as
this
was
painfully
felt
at
the
council
of
the
vatican
where
the
assembled
prelates
discovered
that
their
latin
was
of
no
practical
use
although
the
roman
catholic
clergy
employ
latin
more
habitually
than
any
other
body
of
men
in
the
world
that
a
modern
may
be
taught
to
think
in
latin
is
proved
by
the
early
education
of
montaigne
and
i
may
mention
a
much
more
recent
instance
my
told
me
that
in
the
spring
of
a
friend
of
his
had
come
to
stay
with
him
accompanied
by
his
little
son
a
boy
seven
years
old
this
child
spoke
latin
with
the
utmost
fluency
and
he
spoke
nothing
else
what
i
am
going
to
suggest
is
a
utopian
dream
but
let
us
suppose
that
a
hundred
fathers
could
be
found
in
europe
all
of
this
way
of
thinking
all
resolved
to
submit
to
some
inconvenience
in
order
that
their
sons
might
speak
latin
as
a
living
language
a
small
island
might
be
rented
near
the
coast
of
italy
and
in
that
island
latin
alone
might
be
permitted
just
as
the
successive
governments
of
france
maintain
the
establishments
of
sèvres
and
the
gobelins
to
keep
the
manufactures
of
porcelain
and
tapestry
up
to
a
recognized
high
standard
of
excellence
so
this
latin
island
might
be
maintained
to
give
more
vivacity
to
scholarship
if
there
were
but
one
little
corner
of
ground
on
the
wide
earth
where
pure
latin
was
constantly
spoken
our
knowledge
of
the
classic
writers
would
become
far
more
sympathetically
intimate
after
living
in
the
latin
island
we
should
think
in
latin
as
we
read
and
read
without
translating
but
this
is
dreaming
it
is
too
certain
that
on
returning
from
the
latin
island
into
the
atmosphere
of
modern
colleges
an
evil
change
would
come
over
our
young
latinists
like
that
which
came
upon
the
young
montaigne
when
his
father
sent
him
to
the
college
of
guienne
at
that
time
the
best
and
most
flourishing
in
france
montaigne
tells
us
that
notwithstanding
all
his
father
precautions
the
place
was
a
college
still
my
latin
he
adds
grew
corrupt
and
by
discontinuance
i
have
since
lost
all
manner
of
use
of
if
it
were
the
custom
to
speak
latin
it
would
be
the
custom
to
speak
it
badly
and
a
master
of

have
to
conform
to
the
evil
usages
around
him
our
present
state
of
ignorance
has
the
charm
of
being
silent
except
when
gentlemen
in
the
house
of
commons
quote
poetry
which
they
can
not
pronounce
to
hearers
who
can
not
understand
it
an
english
orator
quoted
from
cicero
the
sentence
non
intelligunt
homines
quam
magnum
vectigal
sit
parsimonia
he
made
the
second
vowel
in
short
and
the
house
laughed
at
him
he
tried
again
and
pronounced
it
with
the
long
sound
of
the
english
on
which
the
critical
body
he
addressed
was
perfectly
satisfied
but
if
a
roman
had
been
present
it
is
probable
that
of
the
two
the
short
english
would
have
astonished
his
ears
the
less
for
our
short
does
bear
some
resemblance
to
the
southern
whereas
our
long
i
resembles
no
single
letter
in
any
alphabet
of
the
latin
family
of
languages
we
are
scrupulously
careful
to
avoid
what
we
call
false
quantities
we
are
quite
utterly
and
ignorantly
unscrupulous
about
false
sounds
one
of
the
best
instances
is
the
veni
vidi
vici
which
we
pronounce
very
much
as
if
it
had
been
written
in
italian
letters
letter
iv
to
a
student
of
literature
studies
whatever
they
may
be
always
considered
by
some
a
waste
of
time
the
classical
languages
the
higher
mathematics
the
accomplishments
indirect
uses
of
different
studies
influence
of
music
studies
indirectly
useful
to
authors
what
induced
roscoe
to
write
the
lives
of
lorenzo
de
medici
and
leo
x
whatever
you
study
some
one
will
consider
that
particular
study
a
foolish
waste
of
time
if
you
were
to
abandon
successively
every
subject
of
intellectual
labor
which
had
in
its
turn
been
condemned
by
some
adviser
as
useless
the
result
would
be
simple
intellectual
nakedness
the
classical
languages
to
begin
with
have
long
been
considered
useless
by
the
majority
of
practical
people
and
pray
what
to
shopkeepers
doctors
attorneys
artists
can
be
the
use
of
the
higher
mathematics
and
if
these
studies
which
have
been
conventionally
classed
as
serious
studies
are
considered
unnecessary
notwithstanding
the
tremendous
authority
of
custom
how
much
the
more
are
those
studies
exposed
to
a
like
contempt
which
belong
to
the
category
of
accomplishments
what
is
the
use
of
drawing
for
it
ends
in
a
worthless
sketch
why
should
we
study
music
when
after
wasting
a
thousand
hours
the
amateur
can
not
satisfy
the
ear
a
modern
languages
when
the
accomplishment
only
enables
us
to
call
a
waiter
in
french
or
german
who
is
sure
to
answer
us
in
english
and
what
when
it
is
not
your
trade
can
be
the
good
of
dissecting
animals
or
plants
to
all
questionings
of
this
kind
there
is
but
one
reply
we
work
for
culture
we
work
to
enlarge
the
intelligence
and
to
make
it
a
better
and
more
effective
instrument
this
is
our
main
purpose
but
it
may
be
added
that
even
for
our
special
labors
it
is
always
difficult
to
say
beforehand
exactly
what
will
turn
out
in
the
end
to
be
most
useful
what
in
appearance
can
be
more
entirely
outside
the
work
of
a
landscape
painter
than
the
study
of
ancient
history
and
yet
i
can
show
you
how
an
interest
in
ancient
history
might
indirectly
be
of
great
service
to
a
landscape
painter
it
would
make
him
profoundly
feel
the
human
associations
of
many
localities
which
to
an
ignorant
man
would
be
devoid
of
interest
or
meaning
and
this
human
interest
in
the
scenes
where
great
events
have
taken
place
or
which
have
been
distinguished
by
the
habitation
of
illustrious
men
in
other
ages
is
in
fact
one
of
the
great
fundamental
motives
of
landscape
painting
it
has
been
very
much
questioned
especially
by
foreign
critics
whether
the
interest
in
botany
which
is
taken
by
some
of
the
more
cultivated
english
landscape
painters
is
not
for
them
a
false
direction
and
wrong
employment
of
the
mind
but
a
landscape
painter
may
feel
his
interest
in
vegetation
infinitely
increased
by
the
accurate
knowledge
of
its
laws
and
such
an
increase
of
interest
would
make
him
work
more
zealously
and
with
less
danger
of
weariness
and
besides
being
a
very
useful
help
to
the
memory
in
retaining
the
authentic
vegetable
forms
it
may
seem
more
difficult
to
show
the
possible
utility
of
a
study
apparently
so
entirely
outside
of
other
studies
as
music
is
and
yet
music
has
an
important
influence
on
the
whole
of
our
emotional
nature
and
indirectly
upon
expression
of
all
kinds
he
who
has
once
learned
the
of
the
musician
the
use
of
and
each
in
its
right
place
when
to
be
lightly
swift
or
majestically
slow
and
especially
how
to
keep
to
the
key
once
chosen
till
the
right
time
has
come
for
changing
it
he
who
has
once
learned
this
knows
the
secret
of
the
arts
no
painter
writer
orator
who
had
the
power
and
judgment
of
a
thoroughly
cultivated
musician
could
sin
against
the
broad
principles
of
taste
more
than
all
other
men
have
authors
reason
to
appreciate
the
indirect
utilities
of
knowledge
that
is
apparently
irrelevant
who
can
tell
what
knowledge
will
be
of
most
use
to
even
the
very
greatest
of
authors
are
indebted
to
miscellaneous
reading
often
in
several
different
languages
for
the
suggestion
of
their
most
original
works
and
for
the
light
which
has
kindled
many
a
shining
thought
of
their
own
and
authors
who
seem
to
have
less
need
than
others
of
an
outward
help
poets
whose
compositions
might
appear
to
be
chiefly
inventive
and
emotional
novelists
who
are
free
from
the
restraints
and
the
researches
of
the
historian
work
up
what
they
know
into
what
they
write
so
that
if
you
could
remove
every
line
which
is
based
on
studies
outside
the
strict
limits
of
their
art
you
would
blot
out
half
their
compositions
take
the
antiquarian
element
out
of
scott
and
see
how
many
of
his
works
could
never
have
been
written
remove
from
brain
the
recollection
of
his
wayward
studies
and
strange
experiences
and
you
would
remove
the
rich
material
of
the
traveller
and
the
essays
and
mutilate
even
the
immortal
vicar
of
wakefield
without
a
classical
education
and
foreign
travel
byron
would
not
have
composed
childe
harold
without
the
most
catholic
interest
in
the
literature
of
all
the
ages
and
of
many
different
peoples
from
the
north
sea
to
the
mediterranean
our
contemporary
william
morris
would
never
have
conceived
and
could
not
have
executed
that
strong
work
the
earthly
paradise
it
may
not
seem
necessary
to
learn
italian
yet
celebrity
as
an
author
was
due
in
the
first
place
to
his
private
fondness
for
italian
literature
he
did
not
learn
italian
in
order
that
he
might
write
his
biographies
but
he
wrote
about
lorenzo
and
leo
because
he
had
mastered
italian
and
because
the
language
led
him
to
take
an
interest
in
the
greatest
house
of
florence
the
way
in
which
authors
are
led
by
their
favorite
studies
indirectly
to
the
great
performance
of
their
lives
has
never
been
more
clearly
illustrated
than
in
this
instance
when
william
roscoe
was
a
young
man
he
had
for
his
friend
francis
holden
nephew
of
richard
holden
a
schoolmaster
in
liverpool
francis
holden
was
a
young
man
of
uncommon
culture
having
at
the
same
time
really
sound
scholarship
in
several
languages
and
an
ardent
enthusiasm
for
literature
he
urged
roscoe
to
study
languages
and
used
especially
in
their
evening
walks
together
to
repeat
to
him
passages
from
the
noblest
poets
of
italy
in
this
way
roscoe
was
led
to
attempt
italian
and
having
once
begun
went
on
till
he
had
mastered
it
it
was
in
the
course
of
these
studies
says
his
biographer
that
he
first
formed
the
idea
of
writing
the
life
of
lorenzo
de
medici
letter
to
a
country
gentleman
who
regretted
that
his
son
had
the
tendencies
of
a
dilettant
inaccuracy
of
the
common
distinction
between
amateur
pursuits
and
more
serious
studies
all
of
us
are
amateurs
in
many
things
prince
albert
the
emperor
napoleon
contrast
between
general
and
professional
education
the
price
of
high
accomplishment
i
agree
with
you
that
amateurship
as
generally
practised
may
be
a
waste
of
time
but
the
common
distinction
between
amateur
pursuits
and
serious
studies
is
inconsistent
a
painter
whose
art
is
imperfect
and
who
does
not
work
for
money
is
called
an
amateur
a
scholar
who
writes
imperfect
latin
not
for
money
escapes
the
imputation
of
amateurship
and
is
called
a
learned
man
surely
we
have
been
blinded
by
custom
in
these
things
ideas
of
frivolity
are
attached
to
imperfect
acquirement
in
certain
directions
and
ideas
of
gravity
to
equally
imperfect
acquirement
in
others
to
write
bad
latin
poetry
is
not
thought
to
be
frivolous
but
it
is
considered
frivolous
to
compose
imperfectly
and
unprofessionally
in
other
fine
arts
yet
are
we
not
all
of
us
amateurs
in
those
pursuits
which
constituted
our
education
amateurs
at
the
best
if
we
loved
them
and
even
inferior
to
amateurs
if
we
disliked
them
we
have
not
sounder
knowledge
or
more
perfect
skill
in
the
ancient
languages
than
prince
albert
had
in
music
we
know
something
of
them
yet
in
comparison
with
perfect
mastery
such
as
that
of
a
cultivated
old
greek
or
roman
our
scholarship
is
at
the
best
on
a
level
with
the
musical
scholarship
of
a
cultivated
amateur
like
the
prince
consort
if
the
essence
of
dilettantism
is
to
be
contented
with
imperfect
attainment
i
fear
that
all
educated
people
must
be
considered
dilettants
it
is
narrated
of
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
that
in
answer
to
some
one
who
inquired
of
his
majesty
whether
the
prince
imperial
was
a
musician
he
replied
that
he
discouraged
dilettantism
and
did
not
wish
his
son
to
be
a
coburg
but
the
emperor
himself
was
quite
as
much
a
dilettant
as
prince
albert
though
their
dilettantism
did
not
lie
in
the
same
directions
the
prince
was
an
amateur
musician
and
artist
the
emperor
was
an
amateur
historian
an
amateur
scholar
and
antiquary
it
may
be
added
that
napoleon
iii
indulged
in
another
and
more
dangerous
kind
of
amateurship
he
had
a
taste
for
amateur
generalship
and
the
consequences
of
his
indulgence
of
this
taste
are
known
to
every
one
the
variety
of
modern
education
encourages
a
scattered
dilettantism
it
is
only
in
professional
life
that
the
energies
of
young
men
are
powerfully
concentrated
there
is
a
steadying
effect
in
thorough
professional
training
which
school
education
does
not
supply
our
boys
receive
praise
and
prizes
for
doing
many
things
most
imperfectly
and
it
is
not
their
fault
if
they
remain
ignorant
of
what
perfection
really
is
and
of
the
immensity
of
the
labor
which
it
costs
i
think
that
you
would
do
well
perhaps
without
discouraging
your
son
too
much
by
chillingly
accurate
estimates
of
the
value
of
what
he
has
done
to
make
him
on
all
proper
occasions
feel
and
see
the
difference
between
and
thorough
mastery
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
a
youth
to
be
made
clearly
aware
how
enormous
a
price
of
labor
nature
has
set
upon
high
accomplishment
in
everything
that
is
really
worthy
of
his
pursuit
it
is
this
persuasion
which
men
usually
arrive
at
only
in
their
maturity
that
operates
as
the
most
effectual
tranquillizer
of
frivolous
activities
letter

what
i

to
you
and
is
not

to
arouse
as
much
professional
animosity
as
you
are
capable
of
feeling
against
an
old

who
are

dignitary
of

have
earned
your
various
titles
in
a
fair
field
as
a
soldier

his
epaulettes
before
the

are
not
the
likeliest
person
to
hear
with
patience
the
unauthorized
theories
of
an
innovator
take
them
then
as
mere
speculations
if
you
will
not
altogether
unworthy
of
consideration
for
they
are
suggested
by
a
sincere
anxiety
for
the
best
interests
of
learning
and
yet
not
very
dangerous
to
vested
interests
of
any
kind
since
they
can
have
little
influence
on
the
practice
or
opinion
of
the
world
i
feel
a
great
dread
of
what
may
be
called
in
intellectual
pursuits
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
government
of
a
country
applies
an
artificial
stimulus
to
certain
branches
of
study
for
their
encouragement
by
the
offer
of
rewards
in
honor
or
in
money
beyond
the
rewards
inherent
in
the
studies
themselves
or
coming
naturally
from
their
usefulness
to
mankind
there
is
a
great
danger
that
men
may
give
a
disproportionate
attention
to
those
favored
branches
of
study
let
me
take
an
example
from
the
practice
of
the
fine
arts
a
government
by
medals
and
crosses
or
by
money
can
easily
create
and
foster
a
school
of
painting
which
is
entirely
out
of
relation
to
the
century
in
which
it
exists
and
quite
incapable
of
working
harmoniously
with
the
contemporary
national
life
this
has
actually
been
done
to
a
considerable
extent
in
various
countries
especially
in
france
and
in
bavaria
a
sort
of
classicism
which
had
scarcely
any
foundation
in
sincerity
of
feeling
was
kept
up
artificially
by
a
system
of
encouragement
which
offered
inducements
outside
the
genuine
ambition
of
an
artist
the
true
enthusiasm
which
is
the
life
of
art
impels
the
artist
to
express
his
own
feeling
for
the
delight
of
others
the
offer
of
a
medal
or
a
pension
induces
him
to
make
the
sort
of
picture
which
is
likely
to
satisfy
the
authorities
he
first
ascertains
what
is
according
to
the
rule
and
then
follows
it
as
nearly
as
he
is
able
he
works
in
a
temper
of
simple
conformity
remote
indeed
from
the
passionate
enthusiasm
of
creation
it
is
so
with
prize
poems
we
all
know
the
sort
of
poetry
which
is
composed
in
order
to
gain
prizes
the
anxiety
of
the
versifier
is
to
be
safe
he
tries
to
compose
what
will
escape
censure
he
dreads
the
originality
that
may
give
offence
but
all
powerful
pictures
and
poems
have
been
wrought
in
the
energy
of
individual
feeling
not
in
conformity
to
a
pattern
now
suppose
that
instead
of
encouraging
poetry
or
painting
a
government
resolves
to
encourage
learning
it
will
patronize
certain
pursuits
to
the
neglect
of
others
or
it
will
encourage
certain
pursuits
more
liberally
than
others
the
subjects
of
such
a
government
will
not
follow
learning
exclusively
for
its
delightfulness
or
its
utility
another
consideration
will
affect
their
choice
they
will
inquire
which
pursuits
are
rewarded
by
prizes
in
honor
or
money
and
they
will
be
strongly
tempted
to
select
them
therefore
unless
the
government
has
exercised
extraordinary
wisdom
men
will
learn
what
they
do
not
really
care
for
and
may
never
practically
want
merely
in
order
to
win
some
academical
grade
so
soon
as
this
object
has
been
attained
they
will
immediately
abandon
the
studies
by
which
they
attained
it
can
it
be
said
that
in
these
cases
the
purposes
of
the
government
were
fulfilled
clearly
not
if
it
desired
to
form
a
permanent
taste
for
learning
but
it
may
have
done
worse
than
fail
in
this
merely
negative
way
it
may
have
diverted
its
youth
from
pursuits
to
which
nature
called
them
and
in
which
they
might
have
effectually
aided
the
advancement
and
the
prosperity
of
the
state
let
us
suppose
that
a
government
were
to
have
a
pet
study
and
offer
great
artificial
inducements
for
success
in
it
suppose
that
the
pet
study
were
entomology
all
the
most
promising
youth
of
the
country
would
spend
ten
years
in
emulating
kirby
and
spence
and
take
their
degrees
as
entomological
bachelors
but
might
it
not
easily
happen
that
to
a
majority
of
the
young
gentlemen
this
pursuit
would
have
acted
positively
as
a
hindrance
by
keeping
them
from
other
pursuits
more
likely
to
help
them
in
their
professions
it
would
not
only
cost
a
great
deal
of
valuable
time
it
would
absorb
a
quantity
of
youthful
energy
which
the
country
can
ill
afford
to
lose
the
government
would
probably
affirm
that
entomology
if
not
always
practically
useful
in
itself
was
an
invaluable
intellectual
training
but
what
if
this
training
used
up
the
early
vigor
which
might
be
needed
for
other
pursuits
and
of
which
every
human
being
has
only
a
limited
supply
we
should
be
told
no
doubt
that
this
powerful
encouragement
was
necessary
to
the
advancement
of
science
and
it
is
true
that
under
such
a
system
the
rudiments
of
entomology
would
be
more
generally
known
but
the
vulgarization
of
rudiments
is
not
the
advancement
of
knowledge
entomology
has
gone
quite
as
far
in
discovery
though
pursued
simply
for
its
own
sake
as
it
would
have
gone
if
it
had
been
made
necessary
to
a
bachelor
degree
you
will
ask
whether
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
abolish
degrees
of
all
kinds
certainly
not
that
is
not
my
project
but
i
believe
that
no
government
is
competent
to
make
a
selection
amongst
intellectual
pursuits
and
say
this
or
that
pursuit
shall
be
encouraged
by
university
degrees
whilst
other
pursuits
of
intellectual
men
shall
have
no
encouragement
whatever
i
may
mention
by
name
your
present
autocrat
of
public
instruction
jules
simon
he
is
a
literary
man
of
some
eminence
he
has
written
several
interesting
books
and
on
the
whole
he
is
probably
more
competent
to
deal
with
these
questions
than
many
of
his
predecessors
but
however
capable
a
man
may
be
he
is
sure
to
be
biassed
by
the
feeling
common
to
all
intellectual
men
which
attributes
a
peculiar
importance
to
their
own
pursuits
i
do
not
like
to
see
any
minister
or
any
cabinet
of
ministers
settling
what
all
the
young
men
of
a
country
are
to
learn
under
penalty
of
exclusion
from
all
the
liberal
professions
what
i
should
think
more
reasonable
would
be
some
such
arrangement
as
the
following
there
might
be
a
board
of
thoroughly
competent
examiners
for
each
branch
of
study
separately
authorized
to
confer
certificates
of
competence
when
a
man
believed
himself
to
have
mastered
a
branch
of
study
he
would
go
and
try
to
get
a
certificate
for
that
the
various
studies
would
then
be
followed
according
to
the
public
sense
of
their
importance
and
would
fall
quite
naturally
into
the
rank
which
they
ought
to
occupy
at
any
given
period
of
the
national
history
these
separate
examinations
should
be
severe
enough
to
ensure
a
serviceable
degree
of
proficiency
nobody
should
be
allowed
to
teach
anything
who
had
not
got
a
certificate
for
the
particular
thing
he
intended
to
profess
in
the
confusion
of
your
present
system
not
only
do
you
fail
to
insure
the
thoroughness
of
pupils
but
the
teachers
themselves
are
too
frequently
incompetent
in
some
speciality
which
accidentally
fails
to
their
share
i
think
that
a
greek
master
ought
to
be
a
complete
hellenist
but
surely
it
is
not
necessary
that
he
should
be
half
a
mathematician
to
sum
up
it
seems
to
me
that
a
government
has
no
business
to
favor
some
intellectual
pursuits
more
than
others
but
that
it
ought
to
recognize
competent
attainment
in
every
one
of
them
by
a
sort
of
diploma
or
certificate
leaving
the
relative
rank
of
different
pursuits
to
be
settled
by
public
opinion
and
as
to
the
educators
themselves
i
think
that
when
a
man
has
proved
his
competence
in
one
thing
he
ought
to
be
allowed
to
teach
that
one
thing
in
the
university
without
being
required
to
pass
an
examination
in
any
other
thing

the
recent
interest
in
modern
languages
a
french
student
of
hebrew
i
was
happy
to
learn
your
opinion
of
the
reform
so
recently
introduced
by
the
minister
of
public
instruction
and
the
more
so
that
i
was
glad
to
find
the
views
of
so
inexperienced
a
person
as
myself
confirmed
by
your
wider
knowledge
you
went
even
farther
than
jules
simon
for
you
openly
expressed
a
desire
for
the
complete
withdrawal
of
greek
from
the
ordinary
school
curriculum
not
that
you
undervalue
greek
no
one
of
your
scholarship
would
be
likely
to
undervalue
a
great
literature
but
you
thought
it
a
loss
of
time
to
acquire
a
language
so
imperfectly
that
the
literature
still
remained
practically
closed
whilst
thousands
of
valuable
hours
had
been
wasted
on
the
details
of
grammar
the
truth
is
that
although
the
principle
of
beginning
many
things
in
school
education
with
the
idea
that
the
pupil
will
in
maturer
life
pursue
them
to
fuller
accomplishment
may
in
some
instances
be
justified
by
the
prolonged
studies
of
men
who
have
a
natural
taste
for
erudition
it
is
idle
to
shut
one
eyes
to
the
fact
that
most
men
have
no
inclination
for
after
they
have
left
school
and
if
they
had
the
inclination
they
have
not
the
time
our
own
arnold
the
model
english
schoolmaster
said
it
is
so
hard
to
begin
anything
in
and
so
comparatively
easy
to
continue
what
has
been
begun
that
i
think
we
are
bound
to
break
ground
as
it
were
into
several
of
the
mines
of
knowledge
with
our
pupils
that
the
first
difficulties
may
be
overcome
by
them
whilst
there
is
yet
a
power
from
without
to
aid
their
own
faltering
resolution
and
that
so
they
may
be
enabled
if
they
will
to
go
on
with
the
study
hereafter
the
principle
here
expressed
is
no
doubt
one
of
the
important
principles
of
all
early
education
and
yet
i
think
that
it
can
not
be
safely
followed
without
taking
account
of
human
nature
such
as
it
is
everything
hangs
on
that
little
parenthesis
if
they
will
and
if
they
will
how
then
the
time
spent
in
breaking
the
ground
has
been
wasted
except
so
far
as
the
exercise
of
breaking
the
ground
may
have
been
useful
in
mental
gymnastics
mature
life
brings
so
many
professional
or
social
duties
that
it
leaves
scant
time
for
culture
and
those
who
care
for
culture
most
earnestly
and
sincerely
are
the
very
persons
who
will
economize
time
to
the
utmost
now
to
read
a
language
that
has
been
very
imperfectly
mastered
is
felt
to
be
a
bad
economy
of
time
suppose
the
case
of
a
man
occupied
in
business
who
has
studied
greek
rather
assiduously
in
youth
and
yet
not
enough
to
read
it
with
facility
suppose
that
this
man
wants
to
get
at
the
mind
of
plato
he
can
read
the
original
but
he
reads
it
so
slowly
that
it
would
cost
him
more
hours
than
he
can
spare
and
this
is
why
he
has
recourse
to
a
translation
in
this
case
there
is
no
indifference
to
greek
culture
on
the
contrary
the
reader
desires
to
assimilate
what
he
can
of
it
but
the
very
earnestness
of
his
wish
to
have
free
access
to
ancient
thought
makes
him
prefer
it
in
modern
language
this
is
the
most
favorable
instance
that
can
be
imagined
except
of
course
those
exceedingly
rare
cases
where
a
man
has
leisure
enough
and
enthusiasm
enough
to
become
a
hellenist
the
great
majority
of
our
contemporaries
do
not
care
for
ancient
thought
at
all
it
is
so
remote
from
them
it
belongs
to
conditions
of
civilization
so
different
from
their
own
it
is
encumbered
with
so
many
lengthy
discussions
of
questions
which
have
been
settled
by
the
subsequent
experience
of
the
world
that
the
modern
mind
prefers
to
occupy
itself
with
its
own
anxieties
and
its
own
speculations
it
is
a
great
error
to
suppose
that
indifference
to
ancient
thinking
is
peculiar
to
the
spirit
of
philistinism
for
the
most
cultivated
contemporary
intellects
seek
light
from
each
other
rather
than
from
the
ancients
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
modern
thinkers
a
scholar
of
the
rarest
classical
attainments
said
to
me
in
reference
to
some
scheme
of
mine
for
renewing
my
classical
studies
that
they
would
be
of
no
more
use
to
me
than
numismatics
it
is
this
feeling
the
feeling
that
greek
speculation
is
of
less
consequence
to
the
modern
world
than
german
and
french
speculation
which
causes
so
many
of
us
rightly
or
wrongly
to
regard
it
as
a
palæontological
curiosity
interesting
for
those
who
are
curious
as
to
the
past
of
the
human
mind
but
not
likely
to
be
influential
upon
its
future
this
estimate
of
ancient
thinking
is
not
often
expressed
quite
so
openly
as
i
have
just
expressed
it
and
yet
it
is
very
generally
prevalent
even
amongst
the
most
thoughtful
people
especially
if
modern
science
has
had
any
conspicuous
influence
in
the
formation
of
their
minds
tho
truth
is
as
sydney
smith
observed
many
years
ago
that
there
is
a
confusion
of
language
in
the
use
of
the
word
ancient
we
say
the
ancients
as
if
they
were
older
and
more
experienced
men
than
we
are
whereas
the
age
and
experience
are
entirely
on
our
side
they
were
the
clever
children
and
we
only
are
the
ancients
who
have
treasured
up
and
are
prepared
to
profit
by
all
the
experience
which
human
life
can
supply
the
sense
of
our
larger
experience
as
it
grows
in
us
and
becomes
more
distinctly
conscious
produces
a
corresponding
decline
in
our
feelings
of
reverence
for
classic
times
the
past
has
bequeathed
to
us
its
results
and
we
have
incorporated
them
into
our
own
edifice
but
we
have
used
them
rather
as
materials
than
as
models
in
your
practical
desire
to
retain
in
education
only
what
is
likely
to
be
used
you
are
willing
to
preserve
latin
jules
simon
says
that
latin
ought
to
be
studied
only
to
be
read
on
this
point
permit
me
to
offer
an
observation
the
one
thing
i
regret
about
latin
is
that
we
have
ceased
to
speak
it
the
natural
method
and
by
far
the
most
rapid
and
sure
method
of
learning
a
language
is
to
begin
by
acquiring
words
in
order
to
use
them
to
ask
for
what
we
want
after
that
we
acquire
other
words
for
narration
and
the
expression
of
our
sentiments
by
far
the
shortest
way
to
learn
to
read
a
language
is
to
begin
by
speaking
it
the
colloquial
tongue
is
the
basis
of
the
literary
tongue
this
is
so
true
that
with
all
the
pains
and
trouble
you
give
to
the
latin
education
of
your
pupils
you
can
not
teach
them
as
much
latin
for
reading
only
in
the
course
of
ten
years
as
a
living
foreigner
will
give
them
of
his
own
language
in
ten
months
i
seriously
believe
that
if
your
object
is
to
make
boys
read
latin
easily
you
begin
at
the
wrong
end
it
is
deplorable
that
the
learned
should
ever
have
allowed
latin
to
become
a
dead
language
since
in
permitting
this
they
have
enormously
increased
the
difficulty
of
acquiring
it
even
for
the
purposes
of
scholarship
no
foreigner
who
knows
the
french
people
will
disapprove
of
the
novel
desire
to
know
the
modern
languages
which
has
been
one
of
the
most
unexpected
consequences
of
the
war
their
extreme
ignorance
of
the
literature
of
other
nations
has
been
the
cause
of
enormous
evils
notwithstanding
her
central
position
france
has
been
a
very
isolated
country
intellectually
much
more
isolated
than
england
more
isolated
even
than
transylvania
where
foreign
literatures
are
familiar
to
the
cultivated
classes
this
isolation
has
produced
very
lamentable
effects
not
only
on
the
national
culture
but
most
especially
on
the
national
character
no
modern
nation
however
important
can
safely
remain
in
ignorance
of
its
contemporaries
the
frenchman
was
like
a
gentleman
shut
up
within
his
own
having
no
intercourse
with
his
neighbors
and
reading
nothing
but
the
history
of
his
own
ancestors
for
the
romans
were
your
ancestors
intellectually
it
is
only
by
the
study
of
living
languages
and
their
continual
use
that
we
can
learn
our
true
place
in
the
world
a
frenchman
was
studying
hebrew
i
ventured
to
suggest
that
german
might
possibly
be
more
useful
to
this
he
answered
there
was
no
literature
in
avez
goethe
vous
avez

vous
avez

mais
en

trois

my
student
of

measured
german

by
his
own
knowledge

it
three
names
had
reached
him
only
names
and
only
three
of
them
as
to
the
men
who
were
unknown
to
him
he
had
decided
that
they
did
not
exist
certainly
if
there
are
many
frenchmen
in
this
condition
it
is

that
they

propositions
based

experience
expectations
and
disappointments

yourself
i
do
not

for
you
wisely
accept
all
help
from
others
been
the
attainment
of
classical
scholarship
i
might
have
observed
that
as
the
received
standard
in
that
kind
of
learning
is
not
a
very
elevated
one
you
might
reasonably
hope
to
reach
it
with
a
certain
calculable
quantity
of
effort
the
classical
student
has
only
to
contend
against
other
students
who
are
and
have
been
situated
very
much
as
he
is
situated
himself
they
have
learned
latin
and
greek
from
grammars
and
dictionaries
as
he
is
learning
them
and
the
only
natural
advantages
which
any
of
his
predecessors
may
have
possessed
are
superiorities
of
memory
which
may
be
compensated
by
his
greater
perseverance
or
superiorities
of
sympathy
to
which
he
may
level
up
by
that
acquired
and
artificial
interest
which
comes
from
protracted
application
but
the
student
of
modern
languages
has
to
contend
against
advantages
of
situation
as
the
gardeners
of
an
inhospitable
climate
contend
against
the
natural
sunshine
of
the
south
how
easy
it
is
to
have
a
fruitful
in
arabia
how
difficult
in
england
how
easy
for
the
florentine
to
speak
italian
how
difficult
for
us
the
modern
linguist
can
never
fence
himself
behind
that
stately
unquestionableness
which
shields
the
classical
scholar
his
knowledge
may
at
any
time
be
put
to
the
severest
of
all
tests
to
a
test
incomparably
more
severe
than
the
strictest
university
examination
the
first
that
he
meets
is
his
examiner
the
first
foreign
city
is
his
oxford
and
this
is
probably
one
reason
why
accomplishment
in
modern
languages
has
been
rather
a
matter
of
utility
than
of
dignity
for
it
is
difficult
to
keep
up
great
pretensions
in
the
face
of
a
multitude
of
critics
what
would
the
most
gown
avail
if
a
malicious
foreigner
were
laughing
at
us
but
there
is
a
deep
satisfaction
in
the
severity
of
the
test
an
honest
and
courageous
student
likes
to
be
clearly
aware
of
the
exact
value
of
his
acquisitions
he
takes
his
french
to
paris
and
has
it
tested
there
as
we
take
our
plate
to
the
silversmith
and
after
that
he
knows
or
may
know
quite
accurately
what
it
is
worth
he
has
not
the
dignity
of
scholarship
he
is
not
held
to
be
a
learned
man
but
he
has
acquired
something
which
may
be
of
daily
use
to
him
in
society
or
in
commerce
or
in
literature
and
there
are
thousands
of
educated
natives
who
can
accurately
estimate
his
attainment
and
help
him
to
a
higher
perfection
all
this
is
deeply
satisfying
to
a
lover
of
intellectual
realities
the
modern
linguist
is
always
on
firm
ground
and
in
broad
daylight
he
may
impede
his
own
progress
by
the
illusions
of
solitary
but
the
atmosphere
outside
is
not
favorable
to
such
illusions
it
is
well
for
him
that
the
temptations
to
charlatanism
are
so
few
that
the
risks
of
exposure
are
so
frequent
still
there
illusions
and
the
commonest
of
them
is
that
a
modern
language
may
be
very
easily
mastered
there
is
a
popular
idea
that
french
is
easy
that
italian
is
easy
that
german
is
more
difficult
yet
by
no
means
insuperably
difficult
it
is
believed
that
when
an
englishman
has
spent
all
the
best
years
of
his
youth
in
attempting
to
learn
latin
and
greek
he
may
acquire
one
or
two
modern
languages
with
little
effort
during
a
brief
residence
on
the
continent
it
is
certainly
true
that
we
may
learn
any
number
of
foreign
languages
so
as
to
speak
them
badly
but
it
surely
can
not
be
easy
to
speak
them
well
it
may
be
inferred
that
this
is
not
easy
because
the
accomplishment
is
so
rare
the
inducements
are
common
the
accomplishment
is
rare
thousands
of
english
people
have
very
strong
reasons
for
learning
french
thousands
of
french
people
could
improve
their
position
by
learning
english
but
rare
indeed
are
the
men
and
women
who
know
both
languages
thoroughly
the
following
propositions
based
on
much
observation
of
a
kind
wholly
unprejudiced
and
tested
by
a
not
inconsiderable
experience
will
be
found
i
believe
unassailable
a
foreign
language
is
perfectly
acquired
there
are
peculiar
family
conditions
the
person
has
either
married
a
person
of
the
other
nation
or
is
of
mixed
a
foreign
language
has
been
acquired
there
are
instances
of
this
in
quite
absolute
perfection
there
is
almost
always
some
loss
in
the
native
tongue
either
the
native
tongue
is
not
spoken
correctly
or
it
is
not
spoken
with
perfect
man
sometimes
speaks
two
languages
correctly
his
father
and
his
mother
or
his
own
and
his
wife
but
never
can
speak
several
languages
exactly
like
natives
but
in
succession
never
simultaneously
they
forget
the
first
in
acquiring
the
second
and
so
language
can
not
be
learned
by
an
adult
without
five
residence
in
the
country
where
it
is
spoken
and
without
habits
of
close
observation
a
residence
of
twenty
years
is
this
is
not
encouraging
but
it
is
the
truth
happily
a
knowledge
which
falls
far
short
of
mastery
may
be
of
much
practical
use
in
the
common
affairs
of
life
and
may
even
afford
some
initiation
into
foreign
literatures
i
do
not
argue
that
because
perfection
is
denied
of
us
by
the
circumstances
of
our
lives
or
the
necessities
of
our
organization
we
are
therefore
to
abandon
the
study
to
every
language
but
the
mother
tongue
it
may
be
of
use
to
us
to
know
several
languages
imperfectly
if
only
we
confess
the
hopelessness
of
absolute
attainment
that
which
is
truly
and
deeply
and
seriously
an
injury
to
our
intellectual
life
is
the
foolishness
of
the
too
common
vanity
which
first
deludes
itself
with
childish
expectations
and
then
tortures
itself
with
late
regret
for
failure
which
might
have
been
easily
foreseen

my
five
propositions
about
learning
modern

appear
from
your
answer
to
have
rather
surprised
you
and
you
ask
for
some
instances
in
illustration
i
am
aware
that
my
last
letter
was
dogmatic
so
let
me
begin
by
begging
your
pardon
for
its
dogmatism
the
present
communication
may
steer
clear
of
that
rock
of
offence
for
it
shall
confine
itself
to
an
account
of
cases
that
i
have
known
one
of
the
most
accomplished
of
english
linguists
remarked
to
me
that
after
much
observation
of
the
labors
of
others
and
a
fair
estimate
of
his
own
he
had
come
to
the
rather
discouraging
conclusion
that
it
was
not
possible
to
learn
a
foreign
language
he
did
not
take
account
of
the
one
exceptional
class
of
cases
where
the
family
conditions
make
the
use
of
two
languages
habitual
the
most
favorable
family
conditions
are
not
in
themselves
sufficient
to
the
acquisition
of
a
language
but
wherever
an
instance
of
perfect
acquisition
is
to
be
found
these
family
conditions
are
always
found
along
with
it
my
friend
an
english
artist
living
in
paris
speaks
french
with
quite
absolute
accuracy
as
to
grammar
and
choice
of
expression
and
with
accuracy
of
pronunciation
so
nearly
absolute
that
the
best
french
ears
can
detect
nothing
wrong
but
the
pronunciation
of
the
letter
he
has
lived
in
france
for
the
space
of
forty
years
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
in
forty
years
he
could
have
mastered
the
language
as
he
has
done
if
he
had
not
married
a
native
french
has
been
his
home
language
for
years
and
more
and
the
perfect
ease
and
naturalness
of
his
diction
are
due
to
the
powerful
home
influences
especially
to
the
influence
of
children
a
child
is
born
that
speaks
the
foreign
tongue
from
the
first
inarticulate
beginnings
it
makes
its
own
child
language
and
the
father
as
he
hears
it
is
born
over
again
in
the
foreign
land
by
tender
paternal
sympathy
gradually
the
sweet
gives
place
to
the
perfect
tongue
and
the
father
follows
it
by
insensible
gradations
himself
the
most
docile
of
pupils
led
onward
rather
than
instructed
by
the
winning
and
playful
little
master
incomparably
the
best
of
masters
the
process
here
is
own
inimitable
process
every
new
child
that
is
born
to
a
man
so
situated
carries
him
through
a
repetition
of
that
marvellous
course
of
teaching
the
language
in
his
brain
from
the
first
rudiments
the
real
natural
rudiments
not
the
hard
rudiments
of
the
grammarian
just
as
plants
grow
naturally
from
their
seeds
it
has
not
been
built
by
human
processes
of
piecing
together
but
has
developed
itself
like
a
living
creature
this
way
of
learning
a
language
possesses
over
the
dictionary
process
exactly
the
kind
of
superiority
which
a
living
man
developed
naturally
from
the
foetus
possesses
over
the
elastic
anatomical
of
the
ingenious
doctor
auzoux
the
doctor
models
are
remarkably
perfect
in
construction
they
have
all
the
organs
but
they
have
not
life
when
however
this
natural
process
of
growth
is
allowed
to
go
forward
without
watchful
care
it
is
likely
to
displace
the
mother
tongue
it
is
sometimes
affirmed
that
the
impressions
of
childhood
are
never
effaced
that
the
mother
tongue
is
forgotten
it
may
be
that
it
is
never
wholly
forgotten
except
in
the
case
of
young
children
but
it
may
become
so
imperfect
as
to
be
practically
of
little
use
i
knew
an
italian
who
came
to
france
as
a
young
man
and
learned
his
profession
there
he
was
afterwards
naturalized
married
a
french
lady
had
several
children
pursued
a
very
successful
career
in
paris
and
became
ultimately
french
ambassador
at
the
court
of
victor
emmanuel
his
french
was
so
perfect
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
any
one
to
detect
the
usual
italian
accents
i
used
to
count
him
as
a
remarkable
and
almost
solitary
instance
of
a
man
speaking
two
languages
in
their
perfection
but
i
learned
since
then
that
his
french
had
displaced
his
italian
and
so
completely
that
he
was
quite
unable
to
speak
italian
correctly
and
made
use
of
french
invariably
when
in
italy
the
risk
of
this
displacement
is
always
greatest
in
cases
where
the
native
tongue
is
not
kept
up
by
means
of
literature
byron
and
shelley
or
our
contemporary
charles
lever
would
run
little
risk
of
losing
english
by
continental
residence
but
people
not
accustomed
to
reading
and
writing
often
forget
the
mother
tongue
in
a
few
years
even
when
the
foreign
one
which
has
displaced
it
is
still
in
a
state
of
imperfection
madame
is
an
english
lady
who
married
a
frenchman
neither
her
husband
nor
her
children
speak
english
and
as
her
relatives
live
in
one
of
our
most
distant
colonies
she
has
been
separated
from
them
for
many
years
isolated
thus
from
english
society
living
in
a
part
of
france
rarely
visited
by
her
countrymen
never
reading
english
and
writing
it
little
and
at
long
intervals
she
speaks
it
now
with
much
difficulty
and
diffidence
her
french
is
not
grammatical
though
she
has
lived
for
many
years
with
people
who
speak
grammatically
but
then
her
french
is
fluent
and
alive
truly
her
own
living
language
now
whilst
english
is
if
not
wholly
forgotten
dead
almost
as
our
latin
is
dead
she
and
i
always
speak
french
together
when
we
meet
because
it
is
easier
for
her
than
english
and
a
more
natural
expression
i
have
known
some
other
cases
of
displacement
of
the
native
tongue
and
have
lately
had
the
opportunity
of
watching
a
case
of
such
displacement
during
its
progress
a
sergeant
in
the
italian
army
deserted
to
join
garibaldi
in
the
campaign
of
on
the
conclusion
of
peace
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
return
to
italy
so
he
settled
in
france
and
married
there
i
found
some
work
for
him
and
for
some
months
saw
him
frequently
up
to
the
date
of
his
marriage
he
spoke
no
language
but
italian
which
he
could
read
and
write
correctly
but
after
his
marriage
the
process
of
displacement
of
the
native
tongue
began
immediately
by
the
corruption
of
it
he
did
not
keep
his
italian
safely
by
itself
putting
the
french
in
a
place
of
its
own
as
he
gradually
acquired
it
but
he
mixed
the
two
inextricably
together
imagine
the
case
of
a
man
who
having
a
bottle
half
full
of
wine
gets
some
beer
given
him
and
pours
it
immediately
into
the
the
beer
will
never
be
pure
beer
but
it
will
effectually
spoil
the
wine
this
process
is
not
so
much
one
of
displacement
as
of
corruption
it
takes
place
readily
in
uncultivated
minds
with
feeble
separating
powers
another
example
of
this
was
a
neapolitan
servant
of
an
english
gentleman
who
mixed
his
italian
twice
first
with
french
and
afterwards
with
english
producing
a
compound
intelligible
to
nobody
but
himself
if
indeed
he
himself
understood
it
at
the
time
i
knew
him
the
man
had
no
means
of
communication
with
his
species
when
his
master
told
him
to
do
anything
he
made
a
guess
at
what
was
likely
to
be
for
the
moment
his
master
most
probable
want
and
sometimes
hit
the
mark
but
more
generally
missed
it
the
man
name
was
alberino
and
i
remember
on
one
occasion
profiting
by
a
mistaken
guess
of
his
after
a
visit
to
alberino
master
my
servant
brought
forth
a
magnificent
basket
of
trout
which
surprised
me
as
nothing
had
been
said
about
them
however
we
ate
them
and
only
discovered
afterwards
that
the
present
was
due
to
an
illusion
of
alberino
his
master
had
never
told
him
to
give
me
the
trout
but
he
had
interpreted
some
other
order
in
that
sense
when
you
asked
him
for
mustard
he
would
first
touch
the
salt
and
then
the
pepper
looking
at
you
inquiringly
till
you
nodded
assent
any
attempt
at
conversation
with
alberino
was
sure
to
lead
to
a
perfect
comedy
of
misunderstandings
he
never
had
the
remotest
idea
of
what
his
interlocutor
was
talking
about
but
he
pretended
to
catch
your
meaning
and
answered
at
haphazard
he
had
a
habit
of
talking
aloud
to
himself
but
in
a
tongue
no
man
could
understand
it
is
a
law
that
cultivated
people
can
keep
languages
apart
and
in
their
purity
better
than
persons
who
have
not
habits
of
intellectual
analysis
when
i
lived
in
scotland
three
languages
were
spoken
in
my
house
all
day
long
and
a
housemaid
came
to
us
from
the
lowlands
who
spoke
nothing
but
lowland
scotch
she
used
to
ask
what
was
the
french
for
this
thing
or
that
and
then
what
was
the
gaelic
for
it
having
been
answered
she
invariably
asked
the
farther
question
which
of
the
three
words
french
gaelic
or
english
the
right
she
remained
to
the
last
entirely
incapable
of
conceiving
how
all
the
three
could
be
right
had
she
learned
another
language
it
must
have
been
by
substitution
for
her
own
this
is
exactly
the
natural
process
which
takes
place
in
the
brains
of
children
who
are
transferred
from
one
country
to
another
my
eldest
boy
spoke
english
in
childhood
as
well
as
any
other
english
child
of
his
age
he
was
taken
to
the
south
of
france
and
in
three
months
he
replaced
his
english
with
provençal
which
he
learned
from
the
servants
about
him
there
were
two
ladies
in
the
house
who
spoke
english
well
and
did
all
in
their
power
in
compliance
with
my
urgent
entreaties
to
preserve
the
boy
native
language
but
the
substitution
took
place
too
rapidly
and
was
beyond
control
he
began
by
an
unwillingness
to
use
english
words
whenever
he
could
use
provençal
instead
and
in
a
remarkably
short
time
this
unwillingness
was
succeeded
by
inability
the
native
language
was
as
completely
taken
out
of
his
brain
as
a
violin
is
taken
out
of
its
case
nothing
remained
not
one
word
not
any
echo
of
an
accent
and
as
a
violinist
may
put
a
new
instrument
into
the
case
from
which
he
has
removed
the
old
one
so
the
new
language
occupied
the
whole
space
which
had
been
occupied
by
english
when
i
saw
the
child
again
there
was
no
means
of
communication
between
us
after
that
he
was
removed
to
the
north
of
france
and
the
same
process
began
again
as
provençal
had
pushed
out
english
so
french
began
to
push
out
provençal
the
process
was
wonderfully
rapid
the
child
heard
people
speak
french
and
he
began
to
speak
french
like
them
without
any
formal
teaching
he
spoke
the
language
as
he
breathed
the
air
in
a
few
weeks
he
did
not
retain
the
least
remnant
of
his
provençal
it
was
gone
after
his
english
into
the
limbo
of
the
utterly
forgotten
novelists
have
occasionally
made
use
of
cases
similar
to
this
but
they
speak
of
the
forgotten
language
as
being
forgotten
in
the
manner
that
scott
forgot
the
manuscript
of
waverley
which
he
found
afterwards
in
the
drawers
of
an
old
when
he
was
seeking
for
they
assume
conveniently
for
the
purposes
of
their
art
that
the
first
language
we
learn
is
never
really
lost
but
may
be
as
it
were
under
certain
circumstances
to
be
found
again
at
some
future
period
now
although
something
of
this
kind
may
be
possible
when
the
first
language
has
been
spoken
in
rather
advanced
boyhood
i
am
convinced
that
in
childhood
a
considerable
number
of
languages
might
succeed
each
other
without
leaving
any
trace
whatever
i
might
have
remarked
that
in
addition
to
english
provençal
and
french
my
boy
had
understood
gaelic
in
his
infancy
at
least
to
some
extent
though
he
did
not
speak
it
the
languages
in
his
case
succeeded
each
other
without
any
cost
of
effort
and
without
any
appreciable
effect
on
health
the
pronunciation
of
each
language
was
quite
faultless
so
far
as
foreign
accent
went
the
child
had
the
defects
of
children
but
of
children
born
in
the
different
countries
where
he
lived
as
we
grow
older
this
facility
of
acquisition
gradually
leaves
us
philarète
chasles
says
that
it
is
quite
impossible
for
any
adult
to
learn
german
an
adult
may
learn
german
as
arnold
did
for
purposes
of
erudition
for
which
it
is
enough
to
know
a
language
as
we
know
latin
but
this
is
not
mastery
you
have
met
with
many
foreign
residents
in
england
who
after
staying
in
the
country
for
many
years
can
barely
make
themselves
intelligible
and
must
certainly
be
incapable
of
appreciating
those
beauties
of
our
literature
which
are
dependent
upon
arrangements
of
sound
the
resisting
power
of
the
adult
brain
is
quite
as
remarkable
as
the
assimilating
power
of
the
immature
brain
a
child
hears
a
sound
and
repeats
it
with
perfect
accuracy
a
man
hears
a
sound
and
by
way
of
imitation
utters
something
altogether
different
being
nevertheless
persuaded
that
it
is
at
least
a
close

approximation
children
imitate
well
but
adults
badly
and
the
acquisition
of
languages
depends
mainly
on
imitation
the
resisting
power
of
adults
is
often
seen
very
remarkably
in
international
marriages
in
those
classes
of
society
where
there
is
not
much
culture
or
leisure
or
disposition
for
culture
the
one
will
not
learn
the
other
language
from
opportunity
or
from
affection
but
only
under
absolute
necessity
it
seems
as
if
two
people
living
always
together
would
gain
each
other
languages
as
a
matter
of
course
but
the
fact
is
that
they
do
not
french
people
who
marry
foreigners
do
not
usually
acquire
the
foreign
language
if
the
pair
remain
in
france
english
people
under
similar
conditions
make
the
attempt
more
frequently
but
they
rest
contented
with
imperfect
attainment
if
the
power
of
resistance
is
so
great
in
people
who
being
wedded
together
for
life
have
peculiarly
strong
inducements
for
learning
each
other
languages
it
need
surprise
us
little
to
find
a
like
power
of
resistance
in
cases
where
motives
of
affection
are
altogether
absent
englishmen
who
go
to
france
as
adults
and
settle
there
frequently
remain
for
many
years
in
a
state
of
which
though
it
may
carry
them
through
the
little
difficulties
of

at
railway
stations
and
restaurants

for
any
intellectual
purpose
of
no
conceivable
utility
i
knew
a
retired
english
officer
a
bachelor
who
for
many
years
had
lived
in
paris
without
any
intention
of
returning
to
england
his
french
just
barely
carried
him
through
the
small
transactions
of
his
daily
life
but
was
so
limited
and
so
incorrect
that
he
could
not
maintain
a
conversation
his
vocabulary
was
very
meagre
his
genders
were
all
wrong
and
he
did
not
know
one
single
verb
literally
not
one
his
pronunciation
was
so
foreign
as
to
be
very
nearly
unintelligible
and
he
hesitated
so
much
that
it
was
painful
to
have
to
listen
to
him
i
could
mention
a
celebrated
german
who
has
lived
in
or
near
paris
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
who
can
neither
speak
nor
write
the
language
with
any
approach
to
accuracy
another
german
who
settled
in
france
as
a
master
of
languages
wrote
french
tolerably
but
spoke
it
there
are
germans
in
london
who
have
lived
there
long
enough
to
have
families
and
make
fortunes
yet
who
continue
to
repeat
the
ordinary
german
faults
of
pronunciation
the
same
faults
which
they
committed
years
ago
when
first
they
landed
on
our
shores
the
child
hears
and
repeats
the
true
sound
the
adult
misleads
himself
by
the
spelling
seldom
indeed
can
the
adult
recover
the
innocence
of
the
ear
it
is
like
the
innocence
of
the
eye
which
has
to
be
recovered
before
we
can
paint
from
nature
and
which
belongs
only
to
infancy
and
to
art
let
me
observe
in
conclusion
that
although
to
know
a
foreign
language
perfectly
is
a
most
valuable
aid
to
the
intellectual
life
i
have
never
known
an
instance
of
very
imperfect
attainment
which
seemed
to
enrich
the
student
intellectually
until
you
can
really
feel
the
refinements
of
a
language
your
mental
culture
can
get
little
help
or
furtherance
from
it
of
any
kind
nothing
but
an
interminable
series
of
misunderstandings
i
think
that
in
the
education
of
our
boys
too
many
languages
are
attempted
and
that
their
minds
would
profit
more
by
the
perfect
acquisition
of
a
single
language
in
addition
to
the
native
tongue
this
of
course
is
looking
at
the
matter
simply
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
there
may
be
practical
reasons
for
knowing
several
languages
imperfectly
it
may
be
of
use
to
many
men
in
commercial
situations
to
know
a
little
of
several
languages
even
a
few
words
and
phrases
are
valuable
to
a
traveller
but
all
intellectual
labor
of
the
higher
kind
requires
much
more
than
that
it
is
of
use
to
society
that
there
should
be
polyglot
waiters
who
can
tell
us
when
the
train
starts
in
four
or
five
languages
but
the
polyglot
waiters
themselves
are
not
intellectually
advanced
by
their
accomplishment
for
after
all
the
facts
of
the
railway
are
always
the
same
small
facts
in
however
many
languages
they
may
be
announced
true
culture
ought
to
strengthen
the
faculty
of
thinking
and
to
provide
the
material
upon
which
that
noble
faculty
may
operate
an
accomplishment
which
does
neither
of
these
two
things
for
us
is
useless
for
our
culture
though
it
may
be
of
considerable
practical
convenience
in
the
affairs
of
ordinary
life
it
is
right
to
add
however
that
there
is
sometimes
an
intellectual
benefit
from
such
accomplishments
to
be
able
to
order
dinner
in
spanish
is
not
in
itself
an
intellectual
advantage
but
if
the
dinner
when
you
have
eaten
it
enables
you
to
visit
a
cathedral
whose
architecture
you
are
qualified
to
appreciate
there
is
a
clear
intellectual
gain
though

indirect

you
seem
to
expect
me
to
do
a
letter
of

on
the
subject
of
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
your
miserable
memory
i
feel
disposed
rather
to
indite
a
letter
of
congratulation
it
is
possible
that
you
may
be
blessed
with
a
selecting
memory
which
is
not
only
useful
for
what
it
retains
but
for
what
it
rejects
in
the
immense
mass
of
facts
which
come
before
you
in
literature
and
in
life
it
is
well
that
you
should
suffer
from
as
little
bewilderment
as
possible
the
nature
of
your
memory
saves
you
from
this
by
unconsciously
selecting
what
has
interested
you
and
letting
the
rest
go
by
what
interests
you
is
what
concerns
you
in
saying
this
i
speak
simply
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
and
suppose
you
to
be
an
intellectual
man
by
the
natural
organization
of
your
brain
to
begin
with
in
saying
that
what
interests
you
is
what
concerns
you
i
mean
intellectually
not
materially
it
may
concern
you
in
the
pecuniary
sense
to
take
an
interest
in
the
law
yet
your
mind
left
to
itself
would
take
little
or
no
interest
in
law
but
an
absorbing
interest
in
botany
the
passionate
studies
of
the
young
goethe
in
many
different
directions
always
in
obedience
to
the
predominant
interests
of
the
moment
are
the
best
example
of
the
way
in
which
a
great
intellect
with
remarkable
powers
of
acquisition
and
liberty
to
grow
in
free
luxuriance
sends
its
roots
into
various
soils
and
draws
from
them
the
constituents
of
its
sap
as
a
student
of
law
as
a
university
student
even
he
was
not
of
the
type
which
parents
and
professors
consider
satisfactory
he
neglected
jurisprudence
he
neglected
even
his
college
studies
but
took
an
interest
in
so
many
other
pursuits
that
his
mind
became
rich
indeed
yet
the
wealth
which
his
mind
acquired
seems
to
have
been
due
to
that
liberty
of
ranging
by
which
it
was
permitted
to
him
to
seek
his
own
everywhere
according
to
the
maxim
of
french
law
prend
son
bien
où
il
le
had
he
been
a
poor
student
bound
down
to
the
exclusively
legal
studies
which
did
not
greatly
interest
him
it
is
likely
that
no
one
would
ever
have
suspected
his
immense
faculty
of
assimilation
in
this
way
men
who
are
set
by
others
to
load
their
memories
with
what
is
not
their
proper
intellectual
food
never
get
the
credit
of
having
any
memory
at
all
and
end
by
themselves
believing
that
they
have
none
these
bad
memories
are
often
the
best
they
are
often
the
selecting
memories
they
seldom
win
distinction
in
examinations
but
in
literature
and
art
they
are
quite
incomparably
superior
to
the
miscellaneous
memories
that
receive
only
as
boxes
and
drawers
receive
what
is
put
into
them
a
good
literary
or
artistic
memory
is
not
like
a
that
takes
in
everything
but
like
a
very
periodical
which
prints
nothing
that
does
not
harmonize
with
its
intellectual
life
a
author
gave
me
this
piece
of
advice
take
as
many
notes
as
you
like
but
when
you
write
do
not
look
at
them
what
you
remember
is
what
you
must
write
and
you
ought
to
give
things
exactly
the
degree
of
relative
importance
that
they
have
in
your
memory
if
you
forget
much
it
is
well
it
will
only
save
beforehand
the
labor
of
erasure
this
advice
would
not
be
suitable
to
every
author
an
author
who
dealt
much
in
minute
facts
ought
to
be
allowed
to
refer
to
his
memoranda
but
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
in
literature
the
advice
was
wise
indeed
in
painting
our
preferences
select
whilst
we
are
in
the
presence
of
nature
and
our
memory
selects
when
we
are
away
from
nature
the
most
beautiful
compositions
are
produced
by
the
selecting
office
of
the
memory
which
retains
some
features
and
even
greatly
exaggerates
them
whilst
it
diminishes
others
and
often
altogether
omits
them
an
artist
who
blamed
himself
for
these
exaggerations
and
omissions
would
blame
himself
for
being
an
artist
let
me
add
a
protest
against
the
common
methods
of
curing
what
are
called
treacherous
memories
they
are
generally
founded
upon
the
association
of
ideas
which
is
so
far
rational
but
then
the
sort
of
association
which
they
have
recourse
to
is
unnatural
and
produces
precisely
the
sort
of
disorder
which
would
be
produced
in
dress
if
a
man
were
insane
enough
to
tie
let
us
say
a
to
one
of
his
and
a
child
kite
to
the
other
the
true
discipline
of
the
mind
is
to
be
effected
only
by
associating
those
things
together
which
have
a
real
relation
of
some
kind
and
the
profounder
the
relation
the
more
it
is
based
upon
the
natural
constitution
of
things
and
the
less
it
concerns
trifling
external
details
the
better
will
be
the
order
of
the
intellect
the
mnemotechnic
art
wholly
disregards
this
and
is
therefore
unsuited
for
intellectual
persons
though
it
may
be
of
some
practical
use
in
ordinary
life
a
little
book
on
memory
of
which
many
editions
have
been
sold
suggests
to
men
who
forget
their
umbrellas
that
they
ought
always
to
associate
the
image
of
an
umbrella
with
that
of
an
open
door
so
that
they
could
never
leave
any
house
without
thinking
of
one
but
would
it
not
be
preferable
to
lose
two
or
three
guineas
annually
rather
than
see
a
spectral
umbrella
in
every
doorway
the
same
writer
suggests
an
idea
which
appears
even
more
objectionable
because
we
are
apt
to
lose
time
we
ought
he
says
to
imagine
a
skeleton
on
the
visage
of
every
man
we
talk
with
that
is
to
say
we
ought
systematically
to
set
about
producing
in
our
brains
an
absurd
association
of
ideas
which
is
quite
closely
allied
to
one
of
the
most
common
forms
of
insanity
it
is
better
to
forget
umbrellas
and
lose
hours
than
fill
our
minds
with
associations
of
a
kind
which
every
disciplined
intellect
does
all
it
can
to
get
rid
of
the
rational
art
of
memory
is
that
used
in
natural
science
we
remember
anatomy
and
botany
because
although
the
facts
they
teach
are
infinitely
numerous
they
are
arranged
according
to
the
constructive
order
of
nature
unless
there
were
a
clear
relation
between
the
anatomy
of
one
animal
and
that
of
others
the
memory
would
refuse
to
burden
itself
with
the
details
of
their
structure
so
in
the
study
of
languages
we
learn
several
languages
by
perceiving
their
true
structural
relations
and
remembering
these
association
of
this
kind
and
the
maintenance
of
order
in
the
mind
are
the
only
arts
of
memory
compatible
with
the
right
government
of
the
intellect
incongruous
and
even
superficial
associations
ought
to
be
systematically
discouraged
and
we
ought
to
value
the
negative
or
rejecting
power
of
the
memory
the
finest
intellects
are
as
remarkable
for
the
ease
with
which
they
resist
and
throw
off
what
does
not
concern
them
as
for
the
permanence
with
which
their
own
truths
engrave
themselves
they
are
like
clear
glass
which
fluoric
acid
etches
indelibly

which

letter
xi
to
a
master
of
arts
who
said
that
a
certain
distinguished
painter
was
conventional
idea
about
the
completeness
of
education
the
estimate
of
a
schoolmaster
no
one
can
be
fully
educated
even
leonardo
da
vinci
fell
short
of
the
complete
expression
of
his
faculties
the
word
education
used
in
two
different
senses
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
who
are
the
learned
quotation
from
sydney
smith
what
a
painter
had
learned
what
faculties
he
had
developed
an
intelligent
lady
was
lamenting
to
me
the
other
day
that
when
she
heard
anything
she
did
not
quite
agree
with
it
only
set
her
thinking
and
did
not
suggest
any
immediate
reply
three
hours
afterwards
she
added
i
arrive
at
the
answer
which
ought
to
have
been
given
but
then
it
is
exactly
three
hours
too
late
being
afflicted
with
precisely
the
same
pitiable
infirmity
i
said
nothing
in
reply
to
a
statement
you
made
yesterday
evening
at
dinner
but
it
occupied
me
in
the
hansom
as
it
rolled
between
the
monotonous
lines
of
houses
and
followed
me
even
into
my
i
should
like
to
answer
it
this
morning
as
one
answers
a
letter
you
said
that
our
friend
the
painter
was
this
made
me
try
to
understand
what
it
is
to
be
educated
and
educated
and
finally
what
must
be
that
quite
perfect
state
of
the
man
who
is
i
fear
that
you
must
have
adopted
some
conventional
idea
about
completeness
of
education
since
you
believe
that
there
is
any
such
thing
as
completeness
and
that
education
can
be
measured
by
fractions
like
the
divisions
of
a
rule
is
not
such
an
idea
just
a
little
arbitrary
it
seems
to
be
the
idea
of
a
schoolmaster
with
his
little
list
of
subjects
and
his
professional
habit
of
estimating
the
progress
of
his
boys
by
the
good
marks
they
are
likely
to
obtain
from
their
examiners
the
schoolboy
would
be
a
schoolboy
towards
his
bachelor
degree
is
that
it
in
the
estimates
of
school
and
college
this
may
be
so
and
it
may
be
well
to
keep
up
the
illusion
during
boyhood
that
there
is
such
a
thing
attainable
as
the
complete
education
that
you
assume
but
the
wider
experience
of
manhood
tends
rather
to
convince
us
that
no
one
can
be
fully
educated
and
that
the
more
rich
and
various
the
natural
talents
the
greater
will
be
the
difficulty
of
educating
the
whole
of
them
indeed
it
does
not
appear
that
in
a
state
of
society
so
advanced
in
the
different
specialities
as
ours
is
men
were
ever
intended
to
do
more
than
develop
by
education
a
few
of
their
natural
gifts
the
only
man
who
came
near
to
a
complete
education
was
leonardo
da
vinci
but
such
a
personage
would
be
impossible
no
contemporary
leonardo
could
be
at
the
same
time
a
leader
in
fine
art
a
great
military
and
civil
engineer
and
a
discoverer
in
theoretical
science
the
specialists
have
gone
too
far
for
him
born
in
our
day
leonardo
would
have
been
either
a
specialist
or
an
amateur
situated
even
as
he
was
in
a
time
and
country
so
remarkably
favorable
to
the
general
development
of
a
variously
gifted
man
he
still
fell
short
of
the
complete
expansion
of
all
his
extraordinary
faculties
he
was
a
great
artist
and
yet
his
artistic
power
was
never
developed
beyond
the
point
of
elaborately
careful
labor
he
never
attained
the
assured
manipulation
of
titian
and
paul
veronese
not
to
mention
the
free
facility
of
velasquez
or
the
splendid
audacity
of
rubens
his
natural
gifts
were
grand
enough
to
have
taken
him
to
a
pitch
of
mastery
that
he
never
reached
but
his
mechanical
and
scientific
tendencies
would
have
their
development
also
and
withdrew
so
much
time
from
art
that
every
renewal
of
his
artistic
labor
was
accompanied
by
long
and
anxious
reflection
the
word
education
is
used

years
ago
by
sydney
smith
and
by
the
help
of
another
passage
in
the
same
paper
where
he
tells
us
that
the
english
clergy
bring
up

men
of
the
country

if
they
were
all
to
keep

i
begin
to
understand
what
you
mean
by
a
person
you
mean
a
person
who
is
only
half
qualified
for
keeping
a
grammar
school
in
this
sense
it
is
very
possible
that
our
friend
the
painter
possesses
nothing
beyond
a
miserable
fraction
of
education
and
yet
he
has
picked
up
a
good
deal
of
valuable
knowledge
outside
the
technical
acquirement
of
a
most
difficult
profession
he
studied
two
years
in
paris
and
four
years
in
florence
and
rome
he
speaks
french
and
italian
quite
fluently
and
with
a
fair
degree
of
correctness
his
knowledge
of
those
two
languages
is
incomparably
more
complete
in
the
sense
of
practical
possession
than
our
fossilized
knowledge
of
latin
and
he
reads
them
almost
as
we
read
english
currently
and
without
translating
he
has
the
heartiest
enjoyment
of
good
literature
there
is
evidence
in
his
pictures
of
a
most
intelligent
sympathy
with
the
greatest
inventive
writers
without
having
a
scientific
nature
he
knows
a
good
deal
about
anatomy
he
has
not
read
greek
poetry
but
he
has
studied
the
old
greek
mind
in
its
architecture
and
sculpture
nature
has
also
endowed
him
with
a
just
appreciation
of
music
and
he
knows
the
immortal
masterpieces
of
the
most
illustrious
composers
all
these
things
would
not
qualify
him
to
teach
a
grammar
school
and
yet
what
greek
of
the
age
of
pericles
ever
knew
half
so
much
this
for
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
now
for
the
development
of
faculty
in
this
respect
he
excels
us
as
performing
athletes
excel
the
people
in
the
streets
consider
the
marvellous
accuracy
of
his
eye
the
precision
of
his
hand
the
closeness
of
his
observation
the
vigor
of
his
memory
and
invention
how
clumsy
and
rude
is
the
most
learned
pedant
in
comparison
with
the
refinement
of
this
delicate
organization
try
to
imagine
what
a
disciplined
creature
he
has
become
how
obedient
are
all
his
faculties
to
the
commands
of
the
central
will
the
brain
conceives
some
image
of
beauty
or
wit
and
immediately
that
clear
conception
is
telegraphed
to
the
fingers
surely
if
the
results
of
education
may
be
estimated
from
the
evidences
of
skill
here
are
some
of
the
most
wonderful
of
such
results

you

of

you
with
your
boundless

it
is
true
that
the
most
absolute
master
of
his
own
hours
still
needs
thrift
if
he
would
turn
them
to
account
and
that
too
many
learn
this
thrift
whilst
others
learn
it
late
will
you
permit
me
to
offer
briefly
a
few
observations
on
which
have
been
suggested
to
me
by
my
own
experience
and
by
the
experience
of
intellectual
friends
it
may
be
accepted
for
certain
to
begin
with
that
men
who
like
yourself
seriously
care
for
culture
and
make
it
next
to
moral
duty
the
principal
object
of
their
lives
are
but
little
exposed
to
waste
time
in
downright
frivolity
of
any
kind
you
may
be
perfectly
idle
at
your
own
times
and
perfectly
frivolous
even
whenever
you
have
a
mind
to
be
frivolous
but
then
you
will
be
clearly
aware
how
the
time
is
passing
and
you
will
throw
it
away
knowingly
as
the
most
careful
of
will
throw
away
a
few
sovereigns
in
a
confessedly
foolish
amusement
merely
for
the
relief
of
a
break
in
the
habit
of
his
life
to
a
man
of
your
tastes
and
temper
there
is
no
danger
of
wasting
too
much
time
so
long
as
the
waste
is
intentional
but
you
are
exposed
to
of
a
much
more
insidious
character
it
is
in
our
pursuits
themselves
that
we
throw
away
our
most
valuable
time
few
intellectual
men
have
the
art
of
economizing
the
hours
of
study
the
very
necessity
which
every
one
acknowledges
of
giving
vast
portions
of
life
to
attain
proficiency
in
anything
makes
us
prodigal
where
we
ought
to
be
parsimonious
and
careless
where
we
have
need
of
unceasing
vigilance
the
best
are
the
love
of
soundness
in
all
we
learn
or
do
and
a
cheerful
acceptance
of
inevitable
limitations
there
is
a
certain
point
of
proficiency
at
which
an
acquisition
begins
to
be
of
use
and
unless
we
have
the
time
and
resolution
necessary
to
reach
that
point
our
labor
is
as
completely
thrown
away
as
that
of
a
mechanic
who
began
to
make
an
engine
but
never
finished
it
each
of
us
has
acquisitions
which
remain
permanently
unavailable
from
their
unsoundness
a
language
or
two
that
we
can
neither
speak
nor
write
a
science
of
which
the
elements
have
not
been
mastered
an
art
which
we
can
not
practice
with
satisfaction
either
to
others
or
to
ourselves
now
the
time
spent
on
these
unsound
accomplishments
has
been
in
great
measure
wasted
not
quite
absolutely
wasted
since
the
mere
labor
of
trying
to
learn
has
been
a
discipline
for
the
mind
but
wasted
so
far
as
the
accomplishments
themselves
are
concerned
and
even
this
mental
discipline
on
which
so
much
stress
is
laid
by
those
whose
interest
it
is
to
encourage
unsound
accomplishment
might
be
obtained
more
perfectly
if
the
subjects
of
study
were
less
numerous
and
more
thoroughly
understood
let
us
not
therefore
in
the
studies
of
our
maturity
repeat
the
error
of
our
youth
let
us
determine
to
have
soundness
that
is
accurately
organized
knowledge
in
the
studies
we
continue
to
pursue
and
let
us
resign
ourselves
to
the
necessity
for
abandoning
those
pursuits
in
which
soundness
is
not
to
be
hoped
for
the
idea
about
scholarship
in
latin
and
greek
that
it
ought
to
be
based
upon
thorough
grammatical
knowledge
is
a
good
example
so
far
as
it
goes
of
what
soundness
really
is
that
ideal
of
scholarship
failed
only
because
it
fell
short
of
soundness
in
other
directions
and
was
not
conscious
of
its
failure
but
there
existed
in
the
minds
of
the
old
scholars
a
fine
resolution
to
be
accurate
and
a
determination
to
give
however
much
labor
might
be
necessary
for
the
attainment
of
accuracy
in
which
there
was
much
grandeur
like
browning
grammarian
they
said
let
me
know
all
prate
not
of
most
or
least
painful
or
easy
and
so
at
least
they
came
to
know
the
ancient
tongues
grammatically
which
few
of
us
do
in
these
days
i
should
define
each
kind
of
knowledge
as
an
organic
whole
and
soundness
as
the
complete
possession
of
all
the
essential
parts
for
example
soundness
in
consists
in
being
able
to
play
the
notes
in
all
the
positions
in
tune
and
with
a
pure
intonation
whatever
may
be
the
degree
of
rapidity
indicated
by
the
musical
composer
soundness
in
painting
consists
in
being
able
to
lay
a
patch
of
color
having
exactly
the
right
shape
and
tint
soundness
in
the
use
of
language
consists
in
being
able
to
put
the
right
word
in
the
right
place
in
each
of
the
sciences
there
are
certain
elementary
notions
without
which
sound
knowledge
is
not
possible
but
these
elementary
notions
are
more
easily
and
rapidly
acquired
than
the
elaborate
knowledge
or
confirmed
skill
necessary
to
the
artist
or
the
linguist
a
man
may
be
a
sound
botanist
without
knowing
a
very
great
number
of
plants
and
the
elements
of
sound
botanical
knowledge
may
be
printed
in
a
portable
volume
and
so
it
is
with
all
the
physical
sciences
the
elementary
notions
which
are
necessary
to
soundness
of
knowledge
may
be
acquired
rapidly
and
at
any
age
hence
it
follows
that
all
whose
leisure
for
culture
is
limited
and
who
value
soundness
of
knowledge
do
wisely
to
pursue
some
branch
of
natural
history
rather
than
languages
or
the
fine
arts
it
is
well
for
every
one
who
desires
to
attain
a
perfect
economy
of
time
to
make
a
list
of
the
different
pursuits
to
which
he
has
devoted
himself
and
to
put
a
note
opposite
to
each
of
them
indicating
the
degree
of
its
unsoundness
with
as
little
as
may
be
after
having
done
this
he
may
easily
ascertain
in
how
many
of
these
pursuits
a
sufficient
degree
of
soundness
is
attainable
for
him
and
when
this
has
been
decided
he
may
at
once
effect
a
great
saving
by
the
total
renunciation
of
the
rest
with
regard
to
those
which
remain
and
which
are
to
be
carried
farther
the
next
thing
to
be
settled
is
the
exact
limit
of
their
cultivation
nothing
is
so
favorable
to
sound
culture
as
the
definite
fixing
of
limits
suppose
for
example
that
the
student
said
to
himself
i
desire
to
know
the
flora
of
the
valley
i
live
in
and
then
set
to
work
systematically
to
make
a
herbarium
illustrating
that
flora
it
is
probable
that
his
labor
would
be
more
thorough
his
temper
more
watchful
and
hopeful
than
if
he
set
himself
to
the
boundless
task
of
the
illimitable
flora
of
the
world
or
in
the
pursuit
of
fine
art
an
amateur
discouraged
by
the
glaring
unsoundness
of
the
kind
of
art
taught
by
ordinary
would
find
the
basis
of
a
more
substantial
superstructure
on
a
narrower
but
firmer
ground
suppose
that
instead
of
the
usual
messes
of
bad
color
and
bad
form
the
student
produced
work
having
some
definite
and
not
unattainable
purpose
would
there
not
be
here
also
an
assured
economy
of
time
accurate
drawing
is
the
basis
of
soundness
in
the
fine
arts
and
an
amateur
by
perseverance
may
reach
accuracy
in
drawing
this
at
least
has
been
proved
by
some
examples
not
by
many
certainly
but
by
some
in
languages
we
may
have
a
limited
purpose
also
that
charming
and
most
intelligent
traveller
louis
énault
tells
us
that
he
regularly
gave
a
week
to
the
study
of
each
new
language
that
he
needed
and
found
that
week
sufficient
the
assertion
is
not
so
presumptuous
as
it
appears
for
the
practical
necessities
of
travelling
énault
found
that
he
required
about
four
hundred
words
and
that
having
a
good
memory
he
was
able
to
learn
about
seventy
words
a
day
the
secret
of
his
success
was
the
invaluable
art
of
selection
and
the
strict
limitation
of
effort
in
accordance
with
a
preconceived
design
a
traveller
not
so
well
skilled
in
selection
might
have
learned
a
thousand
words
with
less
advantage
to
his
travels
and
a
traveller
less
decided
in
purpose
might
have
wasted
several
months
on
the
frontier
of
every
new
country
in
hopeless
efforts
to
master
the
intricacies
of
grammatical
form
it
is
evident
that
in
the
strictest
sense
énault
knowledge
of
norwegian
can
not
have
been
sound
since
he
did
not
master
the
grammar
but
it
was
sound
in
its
own
strictly
limited
way
since
he
got
possession
of
the
four
hundred
words
which
were
to
serve
him
as
current
coin
on
the
same
principle
it
is
a
good
plan
for
students
of
latin
and
greek
who
have
not
time
to
reach
true
scholarship
half
a
lifetime
is
necessary
for
that
to
propose
to
themselves
simply
the
reading
of
the
original
authors
with
the
help
of
a
literal
translation
in
this
way
they
may
attain
a
closer
acquaintance
with
ancient
literature
than
would
be
possible
by
translation
alone
whilst
on
the
other
hand
their
reading
will
be
much
more
extensive
on
account
of
its
greater
rapidity
it
is
for
most
of
us
a
waste
of
time
to
read
latin
and
greek
without
a
translation
on
account
of
the
comparative
slowness
of
the
process
but
it
is
always
an
advantage
to
know
what
was
really
said
in
the
original
and
to
test
the
exactness
of
the
translator
by
continual
reference
to
the
of
the
author
when
the
knowledge
of
the
ancient
language
is
not
sufficient
even
for
this
it
may
still
be
of
use
for
occasional
comparison
even
though
the
passage
has
to
be
fought
through
coupes
de
what
most
of
us
need
in
reference
to
the
ancient
languages
is
a
frank
resignation
to
a
restriction
of
some
kind
it
is
simply
impossible
for
men
occupied
as
most
of
us
are
in
other
pursuits
to
reach
perfect
scholarship
in
those
languages
and
if
we
reached
it
we
should
not
have
time
to
maintain
it
in
modern
languages
it
is
not
so
easy
to
fix
limits
satisfactorily
you
may
resolve
to
read
french
or
german
without
either
writing
or
speaking
them
and
that
would
be
an
effectual
limit
certainly
but
in
practice
it
is
found
difficult
to
keep
within
that
boundary
if
ever
you
travel
or
have
intercourse
with
foreigners
and
when
once
you
begin
to
speak
it
is
so
humiliating
to
speak
badly
that
a
lover
of
soundness
in
accomplishment
will
never
rest
perfectly
satisfied
until
he
speaks
like
a
cultivated
native
which
nobody
ever
did
except
under
peculiar
family
conditions
in
music
the
limits
are
found
more
easily
the
amateur
musician
is
frequently
not
inferior
in
feeling
and
taste
to
the
more
accomplished
professional
and
by
selecting
those
compositions
which
require
much
feeling
and
taste
for
their
interpretation
but
not
so
much
manual
skill
he
may
reach
a
sufficient
success
the
art
is
to
choose
the
very
simplest
music
provided
of
course
that
it
is
beautiful
which
it
frequently
is
and
to
avoid
all
technical
difficulties
which
are
not
really
necessary
to
the
expression
of
feeling
the
amateur
ought
also
to
select
the
easiest
instrument
an
instrument
in
which
the
notes
are
made
for
him
already
rather
than
one
which
compels
him
to
fix
the
notes
as
he
is
playing
the
violin
tempts
amateurs
who
have
a
deep
feeling
for
music
because
it
renders
feeling
as
no
other
instrument
can
render
it
but
the
difficulty
of
just
intonation
is
almost
insuperable
unless
the
whole
time
is
given
to
that
one
instrument
it
is
a
fatal
error
to
perform
on
several
different
instruments
and
an
amateur
who
has
done
so
may
find
a
desirable
limitation
in
restricting
himself
to
one
much
time
is
saved
by
following
pursuits
which
help
each
other
it
is
a
great
help
to
a
landscape
painter
to
know
the
botany
of
the
country
he
works
in
for
botany
gives
the
greatest
possible
distinctness
to
his
memory
of
all
kinds
of
vegetation
therefore
if
a
landscape
painter
takes
to
the
study
of
science
at
all
he
would
do
well
to
study
botany
which
would
be
of
use
in
his
painting
rather
than
chemistry
or
mathematics
which
would
be
entirely
disconnected
from
it
the
memory
easily
retains
the
studies
which
are
auxiliary
to
the
chief
pursuit
entomologists
remember
plants
well
the
reason
being
that
they
find
insects
in
them
just
as

painter

an
excellent
memory
for

where
there
were
any
good
pictures

be

the
secret
of
order
and
proportion
in
our
studies
is
the
true
secret
of
economy
in
time
to
have
one
main
pursuit
and
several
auxiliaries
but
none
that
are
not
auxiliary
is
the
true
principle
of
arrangement
many
hard
workers
have
followed
pursuits
as
widely
disconnected
as
possible
but
this
was
for
the
refreshment
of
absolute
change
not
for
the
economy
of
time
lastly
it
is
a
deplorable
waste
of
time
to
leave
fortresses
untaken
in
our
rear
whatever
has
to
be
mastered
ought
to
be
mastered
so
thoroughly
that
we
shall
not
have
to
come
back
to
it
when
we
ought
to
be
carrying
the
war

enemy
country
but
to
study
on
this
sound
principle
we
require
not
to
be
hurried
and
this
is
why
to
a
sincere
student
all
external

on

will

to

than
they
would
have
given
to

painter
himself
the
picture
that
has
been
once
bought
has
a
recommendation
and
the
quoted
passage
is
both
recommended
and
isolated
from
the
context
trusting
to
this
principle
although
i
am
aware
that
you
have
read
everything
that
sir
arthur
helps
has
published
i
proceed
to
make
the
following
quotation
from
one
of
his
wisest
books
time
and
occasion
are
the
two
important
circumstances
in
human
life
as
regards
which
the
most
mistaken
estimates
are
made
and
the
error
is
universal
it
besets
even
the
most
studious
and
philosophic
men
this
may
notably
be
seen
in
the
present
day
when
many
most
distinguished
men
have
laid
down
projects
for
literature
and
philosophy
to
be
accomplished
by
them
in
their
own
lifetime
which
would
require
several
men
and
many
lifetimes
to
complete
and
generally
speaking
if
any
person
who
has
passed
the
meridian
of
life
looks
back
upon
his
career
he
will
probably
own
that
his
greatest
errors
have
arisen
from
his
not
having
made
sufficient
allowance
for
the
length
of
time
which
his
various
schemes
required
for
their
fulfilment
there
are
many
traditional
maxims
about
time
which
insist
upon
its
brevity
upon
the
necessity
of
using
it
whilst
it
is
there
upon
the
impossibility
of
recovering
what
is
lost
but
the
practical
effect
of
these
maxims
upon
conduct
can
scarcely
be
said
to
answer
to
their
undeniable
importance
the
truth
is
that
although
they
tell
us
to
economize
our
time
they
can
not
in
the
nature
of
things
instruct
us
as
to
the
methods
by
which
it
is
to
be
economized
human
life
is
so
extremely
various
and
complicated
whilst
it
tends
every
day
to
still
greater
variety
and
complication
that
all
maxims
of
a
general
nature
require
a
far
higher
degree
of
intelligence
in
their
application
to
individual
cases
than
it
ever
cost
originally
to
invent
them
any
person
gifted
with
ordinary
common
sense
can
perceive
that
life
is
short
that
time
flies
that
we
ought
to
make
good
use
of
the
present
but
it
needs
the
union
of
much
experience
with
the
most
consummate
wisdom
to
know
exactly
what
ought
to
be
done
and
what
ought
to
be
left
undone
the
latter
being
frequently
by
far
the
more
important
of
the
two
amongst
the
favorable
influences
of
my
early
life
was
the
kindness
of
a
venerable
country
gentleman
who
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
and
passed
many
years
before
he
inherited
his
estates
in
the
practice
of
a
laborious
profession
i
remember
a
theory
of
his
that
experience
was
much
less
valuable
than
is
generally
supposed
because
except
in
matters
of
simple
routine
the
problems
that
present
themselves
to
us
for
solution
are
nearly
always
dangerous
from
the
presence
of
some
unknown
element
the
unknown
element
he
regarded
as
a
hidden
pitfall
and
he
warned
me
that
in
my
progress
through
life
i
might
always
expect
to
tumble
into
it
this
saying
of
his
has
been
so
often
confirmed
since
then
that
i
now
count
upon
the
pitfall
quite
as
a
matter
of
certainty
very
frequently
i
have
escaped
it
but
more
by
good
luck
than
good
management
sometimes
i
have
tumbled
into
it
and
when
this
misfortune
occurred
it
has
not
unfrequently
been
in
consequence
of
having
acted
upon
the
advice
of
some
very
knowing
and
experienced
person
indeed
we
have
all
read
when
we
were
boys
captain
marryat
midshipman
easy
there
is
a
passage
in
that
story
which
may
serve
as
an
illustration
of
what
is
constantly
happening
in
actual
life
the
boats
of
the
were
ordered
to
board
one
of
the
enemy
vessels
young
easy
was
in
command
of
one
of
these
boats
and
as
they
had
to
wait
he
began
to
fish
after
they
had
received
the
order
to
advance
he
delayed
a
little
to
catch
his
fish
and
this
delay
not
only
saved
him
from
being
sunk
by
the
enemy
broadside
but
enabled
him
to
board
the
frenchman
here
the
pitfall
was
avoided
by
idling
away
a
minute
of
time
on
an
occasion
when
minutes
were
like
hours
yet
it
was
mere
luck
not
wisdom
which
led
to
the
good
result
there
was
a
sad
railway
accident
on
one
of
the
continental
lines
last
autumn
a
notable
personage
would
have
been
in
the
train
if
he
had
arrived
in
time
for
it
but
his
miscalculation
saved
him
in
matters
where
there
is
no
risk
of
the
loss
of
life
but
only
of
the
waste
of
a
portion
of
it
in
unprofitable
employment
it
frequently
happens
that
procrastination
which
is
reputed
to
be
the
thief
of
time
becomes
its
best
preserver
suppose
that
you
undertake
an
enterprise
but
defer
the
execution
of
it
from
day
to
day
it
is
quite
possible
that
in
the
interval
some
fact
may
accidentally
come
to
your
knowledge
which
would
cause
a
great
modification
of
your
plan
or
even
its
complete
abandonment
every
thinking
person
is
well
aware
that
the
enormous
loss
of
time
caused
by
the
friction
of
our
legislative
machinery
has
preserved
the
country
from
a
great
deal
of
crude
and
legislation
even
napoleon
the
great
who
had
a
rapidity
of
conception
and
of
action
so
far
surpassing
that
of
other
kings
and
commanders
that
it
seems
to
us
almost
supernatural
said
that
when
you
did
not
quite
know
what
ought
to
be
done
it
was
best
to
do
nothing
at
all
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
living
painters
said
exactly
the
same
thing
with
reference
to
the
practice
of
his
art
and
added
that
very
little
time
would
be
needed
for
the
actual
execution
of
a
picture
if
only
the
artist
knew
beforehand
how
and
where
to
lay
the
color
it
so
often
happens
that
mere
activity
is
a
waste
of
time
that
people
who
have
a
morbid
habit
of
being
busy
are
often
terrible
whilst
on
the
contrary
those
who
are
judiciously
deliberate
and
allow
themselves
intervals
of
leisure
see
the
way
before
them
in
those
intervals
and
save
time
by
the
accuracy
of
their
calculations
a
largely
intelligent
thrift
of
time
is
necessary
to
all
great
works
and
many
works
are
very
great
indeed
relatively
to
the
energies
of
a
single
individual
which
pass
unperceived
in
the
tumult
of
the
world
the
advantages
of
calculating
time
are
artistic
as
well
as
economical
i
think
that
in
this
respect
magnificent
as
are
the
cathedrals
which
the
gothic
builders
have
left
us
they
committed
an
artistic
error
in
the
very
immensity
of
their
plans
they
do
not
appear
to
have
reflected
that
from
the
continual
changes
of
fashion
in
architecture
incongruous
work
would
be
sure
to
intrude
itself
before
their
gigantic
projects
could
be
realized
by
the
generations
that
were
to
succeed
them
for
a
work
of
that
kind
to
possess
artistic
unity
it
ought
to
be
completely
realized
within
the
space
of
forty
years
how
great
is
the
charm
of
those
perfect
edifices
which
like
the
sainte
chapelle
are
the
realization
of
one
sublime
idea
and
those
changes
in
national
thought
which
have
made
the
old
cathedrals
a
jumble
of
incongruous
styles
have
their
parallel
in
the
life
of
every
individual
workman
we
change
from
year
to
year
and
any
work
which
occupies
us
for
very
long
will
be
wanting
in
unity
of
manner
men
are
apt
enough
of
themselves
to
fall
into
the
most
astonishing
delusions
about
the
opportunities
which
time
affords
but
they
are
even
more
deluded
by
the
talk
of
the
people
about
them
when
children
hear
that
a
new
carriage
has
been
ordered
of
the
builder
they
expect
to
see
it
driven
up
to
the
door
in
a
fortnight
with
the
paint
quite
dry
on
the
panels
all
people
are
children
in
this
respect
except
the
workman
who
knows
the
endless
details
of
production
and
the
workman
himself
notwithstanding
the
lessons
of
experience
makes
light
of
the
future
task
what
gigantic
plans
we
scheme
and
how
little
we
advance
in
the
labor
of
a
day
three
pages
of
the
book
to
be
half
erased
a
bit
of
drapery
in
the
picture
that
will
probably
have
to
be
done
over
again
the
imperceptible
removal
of
an
ounce
of
from
the
statue
that
seems
as
if
it
never
would
be
finished
so
much
from
dawn
to
twilight
has
been
the
accomplishment
of
the
golden
hours
if
there
is
one
lesson
which
experience
teaches
surely
it
is
this
to
make
plans
that
are
strictly
limited
and
to
arrange
our
work
in
a
practicable
way
within
the
limits
that
we
must
accept
others
expect
so
much
from
us
that
it
seems
as
if
we
had
accomplished
nothing
what
have
you
done
only
that
they
say
or
we
know
by
their
looks
that
they
are
thinking
it
the
most
illusory
of
all
the
work
that
we
propose
to
ourselves
is
reading
it
seems
so
easy
to
read
that
we
intend
in
the
indefinite
future
to
master
the
vastest
literatures
we
can
not
bring
ourselves
to
admit
that
the
library
we
have
collected
is
in
great
part
closed
to
us
simply
by
want
of
time
a
dear
friend
of
mine
who
was
a
solicitor
with
a
large
practice
indulged
in
wonderful
illusions
about
reading
and
collected
several
thousand
volumes
all
fine
editions
but
he
died
without
having
cut
their
leaves
i
like
the
university
habit
of
making
reading
a
business
and
estimating
the
mastery
of
a
few
authors
as
a
just
title
to
consideration
for
scholarship
i
should
like
very
well
to
be
shut
up
in
a
garden
for
a
whole
summer
with
no
literature
but
the
faëry
queene
and
one
year
i
very
nearly
realized
that
project
but
publishers
and
the
postman
interfered
with
it
after
all
this
business
of
reading
ought
to
be
less
illusory
than
most
others
for
printers
divide
books
into
pages
which
they
number
so
that
with
a
moderate
skill
in
arithmetic
one
ought
to
be
able
to
foresee
the
limits
of
his
possibilities
there
is
another
observation
which
may
be
suggested
and
that
is
to
take
note
of
the
time
required
for
reading
different
languages
we
read
very
slowly
when
the
language
is
imperfectly
mastered
and
we
need
the
dictionary
whereas
in
the
native
tongue
we
see
the
whole
page
almost
at
a
glance
as
if
it
were
a
picture
people
whose
time
for
reading
is
limited
ought
not
to
waste
it
in
grammars
and
dictionaries
but
to
confine
themselves
resolutely
to
a
couple
of
languages
or
three
at
the
very
utmost
notwithstanding
the
contempt
of
polyglots
who
estimate
your
learning
by
the
variety
of
your
tongues
it
is
a
fearful
throwing
away
of
time
from
the
literary
point
of
view
to
begin
more
languages
than
you
can
master
or
retain
and
to
be
always
puzzling
yourself
about
irregular
verbs
all
plans
for
sparing
time
in
intellectual
matters
ought
however
to
proceed
upon
the
principle
of
thrift
and
not
upon
the
principle
of
avarice
the
object
of
the
thrifty
man
in
money
matters
is
so
to
lay
out
his
money
as
to
get
the
best
possible
result
from
his
expenditure
the
object
of
the
avaricious
man
is
to
spend
no
more
money
than
he
can
help
an
artist
who
taught
me
painting
often
repeated
a
piece
of
advice
which
is
valuable
in
other
things
than
art
and
which
i
try
to
remember
whenever
patience
fails
he
used
to
say
to
me
it
the
mere
length
of
time
that
we
bestow
upon
our
work
is
in
itself
a
most
important
element
of
success
and
if
i
object
to
the
use
of
languages
that
we
only
half
know
it
is
not
because
it
takes
us
a
long
time
to
get
through
a
chapter
but
because
we
are
compelled
to
think
about
syntax
and
conjugations
which
did
not
in
the
least
occupy
the
mind
of
the
author
when
we
ought
rather
to
be
thinking
about
those
things
which
occupy
his
mind
about
the
events
which
he
narrated
or
the
characters
that
he
imagined
or
described
there
are
in
truth
only
two
ways
of
impressing
anything
on
the
memory
either
intensity
or
duration
if
you
saw
a
man
struck
down
by
an
assassin
you
would
remember
the
occurrence
all
your
life
but
to
remember
with
equal
vividness
a
picture
of
the
assassination
you
would
probably
be
obliged
to
spend
a
month
or
two
in
copying
it
the
subjects
of
our
studies
rarely
produce
an
intensity
of
emotion
sufficient
to
ensure
perfect
recollection
without
the
expenditure
of
time
and
when
your
object
is
not
to
learn
but
to
produce
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
everything
requires
a
certain
definite
which
be
reduced
without
an
inevitable
injury
to
quality
a
most
experienced
artist
a
man
of
the
very
rarest
executive
ability
wrote
to
me
the
other
day
about
a
set
of
designs
i
had
suggested
if
i
could
but
get
the
time
the
large
capitals
are
his
own
for
somehow
or
other
let
a
design
be
never
so
studiously
simple
in
the
masses
it
fill
itself
as
it
goes
on
like
the
weasel
in
the
fable
who
got
into
the
and
when
the
pleasure
begins
in
attempting
tone
and
mystery
and
intricacy
go
the
hours
at
a
a
and
very
successful
english
dramatist
wrote
to
me
when
i
am
hurried
and
have
undertaken
more
work
than
i
can
execute
in
the
time
at
my
disposal
i
am
always
perfectly
paralyzed
there
is
another
side
to
this
subject
which
deserves
attention
some
men
work
best
under
the
sense
of
pressure
simple
compression
evolves
heat
from
iron
so
that
there
is
a
flash
of
fire
when
a
ball
hits
the
side
of
an
ironclad
the
same
law
seems
to
hold
good
in
the
intellectual
life
of
man
whenever
he
needs
the
stimulus
of
extraordinary
excitement
rossini
positively
advised
a
young
composer
never
to
write
his
overture
until
the
evening
before
the
first
performance
nothing
he
said
excites
inspiration
like
necessity
the
presence
of
a
copyist
waiting
for
your
work
and
the
view
of
a
manager
in
despair
tearing
out
his
hair
by
handfuls
in
italy
in
my
time
all
the
managers
were
bald
at
thirty
i
composed
the
overture
to
in
a
small
room
in
the
barbaja
palace
where
the
baldest
and
most
ferocious
of
managers
had
shut
me
up
by
force
with
nothing
but
a
dish
of
maccaroni
and
the
threat
that
i
should
not
leave
the
place
alive
until
i
had
written
the
last
note
i
wrote
the
overture
to
the
ladra
on
the
day
of
the
first
performance
in
the
upper
loft
of
the
la
scala
where
i
had
been
confined
by
the
manager
under
the
guard
of
four
who
had
orders
to
throw
my
text
out
of
the
window
bit
by
bit
to
copyists
who
were
waiting
below
to
transcribe
it
in
default
of
music
i
was
to
be
thrown
out
myself
i
have
quoted
the
best
instance
known
to
me
of
this
voluntary
seeking
after
pressure
but
striking
as
it
is
even
this
instance
does
not
weaken
what
i
said
before
for
observe
that
although
rossini
deferred
the
composition
of
his
overture
till
the
evening
before
the
first
performance
he
knew
very
well
that
he
could
do
it
thoroughly
in
the
time
he
was
like
a
clever
schoolboy
who
knows
that
he
can
learn
his
lesson
in
the
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
class
begins
or
he
was
like
an
orator
who
knows
that
he
can
deliver
a
passage
and
compose
at
the
same
time
the
one
which
is
to
follow
so
that
he
prefers
to
arrange
his
speech
in
the
presence
of
his
audience
since
rossini
always
allowed
himself
all
the
time
that
was
necessary
for
what
he
had
to
do
it
is
clear
that
he
did
not
sin
against
the
great
the
express
which
can
travel
from
london
to
edinburgh
in
a
night
may
leave
the
english
metropolis
on
saturday
evening
although
it
is
due
in
scotland
on
sunday
and
still
act
with
the
strictest
consideration
about
time
the
blameable
error
lies
in
miscalculation
and
not
in
rapidity
of
performance
nothing
time
like
miscalculation
it
negatives
all
results
it
is
the
parent
of
incompleteness
the
great
author
of
the
unfinished
and
the
unserviceable
almost
every
intellectual
man
has
laid
out
great
masses
of
time
on
five
or
six
different
branches
of
knowledge
which
are
not
of
the
least
use
to
him
simply
because
he
has
not
carried
them
far
enough
and
could
not
carry
them
far
enough
in
the
time
he
had
to
give
yet
this
might
have
been
ascertained
at
the
beginning
by
the
simplest
arithmetical
calculation
the
experience
of
students
in
all
departments
of
knowledge
has
quite
definitely
ascertained
the
amount
of
time
that
is
necessary
for
success
in
them
and
the
successful
student
can
at
once
inform
the
aspirant
how
far
he
is
likely
to
travel
along
the
road
what
is
the
use
to
anybody
of
having
just
enough
skill
to
feel
vexed
with
himself
that
he
has
no
more
and
yet
angry
at
other
people
for
not
admiring
the
little
that
he
possesses
i
wish
to
direct
your
attention
to
a
cause
which
more
than
any
other
produces
disappointment
in
ordinary
intellectual
pursuits
it
is
this
people
can
often
calculate
with
the
utmost
accuracy
what
they
can
accomplish
in
ten
minutes
or
even
in
ten
hours
and
yet
the
very
same
persons
will
make
the
most
absurd
miscalculations
about
what
they
can
accomplish
in
ten
years
there
is
of
course
a
reason
for
this
if
there
were
not
so
many
sensible
people
would
not
suffer
from
the
delusion
the
reason
is
that
owing
to
the
habits
of
human
life
there
is
a
certain
elasticity
in
large
spaces
of
time
that
include
nights
and
mealtimes
and
holidays
we
fancy
that
we
shall
be
able
by
working
harder
than
we
have
been
accustomed
to
work
and
by
stealing
hours
from
all
the
different
kinds
of
rest
and
amusement
to
accomplish
far
more
in
the
ten
years
that
are
to
come
than
we
have
ever
actually
accomplished
in
the
same
space
and
to
a
certain
extent
this
may
be
very
true
no
doubt
a
man
whose
mind
has
become
seriously
aware
of
the
vast
importance
of
economizing
his
time
will
economize
it
better
than
he
did
in
the
days
before
the
new
conviction
came
to
him
no
doubt
after
skill
in
our
work
has
been
confirmed
we
shall
perform
it
with
increased
speed
but
the
elasticity
of
time
is
rather
that
of
leather
than
that
of
there
is
certainly
a
degree
of
elasticity
but
the
degree
is
strictly
limited
the
true
master
of
would
be
no
more
liable
to
illusion
about
years
than
about
hours
and
would
act
as
prudently
when
working
for
remote
results
as
for
near
ones
not
that
we
ought
to
work
as
if
we
were
always
under
severe
pressure
little
books
are
occasionally
published
in
which
we
are
told
that
it
is
a
sin
to
lose
a
minute
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
this
doctrine
is
simply
stupid
what
the
philistines
call
wasted
time
is
often
rich
in
the
most
varied
experience
to
the
intelligent
if
all
that
we
have
learned
in
idle
moments
could
be
suddenly
expelled
from
our
minds
by
some
chemical
process
it
is
probable
that
they
would
be
worth
very
little
afterwards
what
after
such
a
process
would
have
remained

these
great

nature
were

sort

the
foolish
little
books
just
alluded
to

them

of
delicate
and
observant
genius
attached
the
greatest
importance

of

said
that
a
year
of
downright
loitering
was
a
desirable
element
in
a
liberal
education
whilst
claude
tillier
went
even
farther
and
boldly
affirmed
that
le
temps
le
mieux
employé
est
celui
que
perd
let
us
not
think
too
contemptuously
of
the
miscalculators
of
time
since
not
one
of
us
is
exempt
from
their
folly
we
have
all
made
miscalculations
or
more
frequently
have
simply
omitted
calculation
altogether
preferring
childish
illusion
to
a
manly
examination
of
realities
and
afterwards
as
life
advances
another
illusion
steals
over
us
not
less
vain
than
the
early
one
but
bitter
as
that
was
sweet
we
now
begin
to
reproach
ourselves
with
all
the
opportunities
that
have
been
neglected
and
now
our
folly
is
to
imagine
that
we
might
have
done
impossible
wonders
if
we
had
only
exercised
a
little
resolution
we
might
have
been
thorough
classical
scholars
and
spoken
all
the
great
modern
languages
and
written
immortal
books
and
made
a
colossal
fortune

these

most
imbecile
of
all
for
the
youth
who
forgets
to
reason
in
the
glow

happiness
and
hope

wiser

overestimates
what
was

about

account
of
the
expenditure
of
time
comme

he
says
de
la

je
demandai

à
de

de
comment

prenaient

voici

cela
nuise
à

et
il
reste
après
une
autre
à
causer
avec
sa
femme
et
à
faire
jouer
ses

au
travail
pour
six

et
avant

il
recommence
tous
les

ne

voilà
me
dit
mon
ami
oersted
le
plus
grand
physicien
de
en
est
aussi
le
plus
grand
médecin
voilà
comment
kant
le
métaphysicien
était
un
des
plus
savants
astronomes
de
et
comment

en

here
is
something
to
encourage
and
something
to
discourage
you
at
the
same
time
the
number
of
hours
which
these
men
have
given
in
order
to
become
what
they
were
is
so
great
as
to
be
past
all
possibility
of
imitation
by
a
man
occupied
in
business
it
is
clear
that
with
your
to
occupy
you
during
the
best
hours
of
every
day
you
can
never
labor
for
your
intellectual
culture
with
that
unremitting
application
which
these
men
have
given
for
theirs
but
on
the
other
hand
you
will
perceive
that
these
extraordinary
workers
have
hardly
ever
been
wholly
dedicated
to
one
pursuit
and
the
reason
for
this
in
most
cases
is
clear
men
who
go
through
a
prodigious
amount
of
work
feel
the
necessity
for
varying
it
the
greatest
intellectual
workers
i
have
known
personally
have
varied
their
studies
as
kant
and
goethe
did
often
taking
up
subjects
of
the
most
opposite
kinds
as
for
instance
imaginative
literature
and
the
higher
mathematics
the
critical
and
practical
study
of
fine
art
and
the
natural
sciences
music
and
political
economy
the
class
of
intellects
which
arrogate
to
themselves
the
epithet
practical
but
which
we
call
always
oppose
this
love
of
variety
and
have
an
unaffected
contempt
for
it
but
these
are
matters
beyond
their
power
of
judgment
they
can
not
know
the
needs
of
the
intellectual
life
because
they
have
never
lived
it
the
practice
of
all
the
greatest
intellects
has
been
to
cultivate
themselves
variously
and
if
they
have
always
done
so
it
must
be
because
they
have
felt
the
need
of
it
the
encouraging
inference
which
you
may
draw
from
this
in
reference
to
your
own
case
is
that
since
all
intellectual
men
have
had
more
than
one
pursuit
you
may
set
off
your
business
against
the
most
absorbing
of
their
pursuits
and
for
the
rest
be
still
almost
as
rich
in
time
as
they
have
been
you
may
study
literature
as
some
painters
have
studied
it
or
science
as
some
literary
men
have
studied
it
the
first
step
is
to
establish
a
regulated
economy
of
your
time
so
that
without
interfering
with
a
due
attention
to
business
and
to
health
you
may
get
two
clear
hours
every
day
for
reading
of
the
best
kind
it
is
not
much
some
men
would
tell
you
that
it
is
not
enough
but
i
purposely
fix
the
expenditure
of
time
at
a
low
figure
because
i
want
it
to
be
always
practicable
consistently
with
all
the
duties
and
necessary
pleasures
of
your
life
if
i
told
you
to
read
four
hours
every
day
i
know
beforehand
what
would
be
the
consequence
you
would
keep
the
rule
for
three
days
by
an
effort
then
some
engagement
would
occur
to
break
it
and
you
would
have
no
rule
at
all
and
please
observe
that
the
two
hours
are
to
be
given
quite
regularly
because
when
the
time
given
is
not
much
regularity
is
quite
essential
two
hours
a
day
regularly
make
more
than
seven
hundred
hours
in
a
year
and
in
seven
hundred
hours
wisely
and
uninterruptedly
occupied
much
may
be
done
in
anything
permit
me
to
insist
upon
that
word
few
people
realize
the
full
evil
of
an
interruption
few
people
know
all
that
is
implied
by
it
after
warning
nurses
against
the
evils
of
interruption
florence
nightingale
says
these
things
are
not
fancy
if
we
consider
that
with
sick
as
with
well
every
thought
decomposes
some
nervous
matter
that
decomposition
as
well
as
of
nervous
matter
is
always
going
on
and
more
quickly
with
the
sick
than
with
the
well
that
to
obtrude
another
thought
upon
the
brain
whilst
it
is
in
the
act
of
destroying
nervous
matter
by
thinking
is
calling
upon
it
to
make
a
new
exertion
if
we
consider
these
things
which
are
facts
not
fancies
we
shall
remember
that
we
are
doing
positive
injury
by
interrupting
by
startling
a
person
as
it
is
called
alas
it
is
no
fancy
if
the
invalid
is
forced
by
his
avocations
to
continue
occupations
requiring
much
thinking
the
injury
is
doubly
great
in
feeding
a
patient
suffering
under
delirium
or
stupor
you
may
suffocate
him
by
giving
him
his
food
suddenly
but
if
you
rub
his
lips
gently
with
a
spoon
and
thus
attract
his
attention
he
will
swallow
the
food
unconsciously
but
with
perfect
safety
thus
it
is
with
the
brain
if
you
offer
it
a
thought
especially
one
requiring
a
decision
abruptly
you
do
it
a
real
not
fanciful
injury
never
speak
to
a
sick
person
suddenly
but
at
the
same
time
do
not
keep
his
expectation
on
the
tiptoe
to
this
you
will
already
have
answered
mentally
that
you
are
not
a
patient
suffering
under
either
delirium
or
stupor
and
that
nobody
needs
to
rub
your
lips
gently
with
a
spoon
but
miss
nightingale
does
not
consider
interruption
baneful
to
sick
persons
only
this
rule
indeed
she
continues
applies
to
the
well
quite
as
much
as
to
the
sick
have
never
known
persons
who
exposed
themselves
for
years
to
constant
interruption
who
did
not
muddle
away
their
intellects
by
it
at
the
process
with
them
may
be
accomplished
without
pain
with
the
sick
pain
gives
warning
of
the
injury
interruption
is
an
evil
to
the
reader
which
must
be
estimated
very
differently
from
ordinary
business
interruptions
the
great
question
about
interruption
is
not
whether
it
compels
you
to
divert
your
attention
to
other
facts
but
whether
it
compels
you
to
tune
your
whole
mind
to
another
diapason
shopkeepers
are
incessantly
compelled
to
change
the
subject
a
stationer
is
asked
for
notepaper
one
minute
for
the
next
and
immediately
afterwards
for
a
particular
sort
of
steel
pen
the
subjects
of
his
thoughts
are
changed
very
rapidly
but
the
general
state
of
his
mind
is
not
changed
he
is
always
strictly
in
his
shop
as
much
mentally
as
physically
when
an
attorney
is
interrupted
in
the
study
of
a
case
by
the
arrival
of
a
client
who
asks
him
questions
about
another
case
the
change
is
more
difficult
to
bear
yet
even
here
the
general
state
of
mind
the
legal
state
of
mind
is
not
interfered
with
but
now
suppose
a
reader
perfectly
absorbed
in
his
author
an
author
belonging
very
likely
to
another
age
and
another
civilization
entirely
different
from
ours
suppose
that
you
are
reading
the
defence
of
socrates
in
plato
and
have
the
whole
scene
before
you
as
in
a
picture
the
tribunal
of
the
five
hundred
the
pure
greek
architecture
the
interested
athenian
public
the
odious
melitus
the
envious
enemies
the
beloved
and
grieving
friends
whose
names
are
dear
to
us
and
immortal
and
in
the
centre
you
see
one
figure
draped
like
a
poor
man
in
cheap
and
common
cloth
that
he
wears
winter
and
summer
with
a
face
plain
to
downright
ugliness
but
an
air
of
such
genuine
courage
and
that
no
acting
could
imitate
it
and
you
hear
the
firm
voice
saying
greek
timatai
d
oun
moi
hanêr
thanatou
eien
you
are
just
beginning
the
splendid
paragraph
where
socrates
condemns
himself
to
maintenance
in
the
prytaneum
and
if
you
can
only
be
safe
from
interruption
till
it
is
finished
you
will
have
one
of
those
minutes
of
noble
pleasure
which
are
the
rewards
of
intellectual
toil
but
if
you
are
reading
in
the
daytime
in
a
house
where
there
are
women
and
children
or
where
people
can
fasten
upon
you
for
pottering
details
of
business
you
may
be
sure
that
you
will
be
able
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
passage
without
in
some
way
or
other
being
rudely
awakened
from
your
dream
and
suddenly
brought
back
into
the
common
world
the
loss
intellectually
is
greater
than
any
one
who
had
not
suffered
from
it
could
imagine
people
think
that
an
interruption
is
merely
the
unhooking
of
an
electric
chain
and
that
the
current
will
flow
when
the
chain
is
hooked
on
again
just
as
it
did
before
to
the
intellectual
and
imaginative
student
an
interruption
is
not
that
it
is
the
destruction
of
a
picture
letter
iv
to
a
student
who
felt
hurried
and
driven
people
who
like
to
be
hurried
sluggish
temperaments
gain
vivacity
under
pressure
routine
work
may
be
done
at
increased
speed
the
higher
intellectual
work
can
not
be
done
hurriedly
the
art
of
avoiding
hurry
consists
in
selection
how
it
was
practised
by
a
good
landscape
painter
selection
in
reading
and
writing
some
studies
allow
the
play
of
selection
more
than
others
do
languages
permit
it
less
than
natural
sciences
difficulty
of
using
selection
in
the
fulfilment
of
literary
engagements
so
you
have
got
yourself
into
that
pleasant
condition
which
is
about
as
agreeable
and
as
favorable
to
fruitful
study
and
observation
as
the
condition
of
an
very
indolent
men
who
will
not
work
at
all
unless
under
the
pressure
of
immediate
urgency
sometimes
tell
us
that
they
actually
like
to
be
hurried
but
although
certain
kinds
of
practical
work
which
have
become
perfectly
easy
from
habit
may
be
got
through
at
a
great
pace
when
the
workman
feels
that
there
is
an
immediate
necessity
for
effort
it
is
certainly
not
true
that
hurry
is
favorable
to
sound
study
of
any
kind
work
which
merely
runs
in
a
fixed
groove
may
be
urged
on
occasionally
at
express
speed
without
any
perceptible
injury
to
the
quality
of
it
a
clever
violinist
can
play
a
passage
as
correctly
as
if
he
played
it
a
banker
clerk
can
count
money
very
rapidly
with
positively
less
risk
of
error
than
if
he
counted
it
as
you
and
i
do
a
person
of
sluggish
temperament
really
gains
in
vivacity
when
he
is
pressed
for
time
and
becomes
during
those
moments
of
excited
energy
a
and
more
able
person
than
he
is
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
he
should
find
himself
able
to
accomplish
more
under
the
great
stimulus
of
an
immediate
necessity
than
he
is
able
to
do
in
the
dulness
of
his
existence
great
prodigies
of
labor
have
been
performed
in
this
way
to
avert
impending
calamity
especially
by
military
officers
in
critical
times
like
those
of
the
sepoy
rebellion
and
in
the
obscurer
lives
of
tradesmen
immense
exertions
are
often
made
to
avert
the
danger
of
bankruptcy
when
without
the
excitement
of
a
serious
anxiety
of
that
kind
the
tradesman
would
not
feel
capable
of
more
than
a
moderate
and
reasonable
degree
of
attention
to
his
affairs
but
notwithstanding
the
many
instances
of
this
kind
which
might
be
cited
and
the
many
more
which
might
easily
be
collected
the
truth
remains
that
the
highest
kinds
of
intellectual
labor
can
hardly
ever
be
properly
performed
when
the
degree
of
pressure
is
in
the
least
excessive
you
may
for
example
if
you
have
the
kind
of
ability
which
makes
a
good
journalist
write
an
effective
leader
with
your
watch
lying
on
the
table
and
finish
it
exactly
when
the
time
is
up
but
if
you
had
the
kind
of
ability
which
makes
a
good
poet
you
could
not
write
anything
like
poetry
against
time
it
is
equally
clear
that
scientific
discovery
which
though
it
may
flash
suddenly
upon
the
mind
of
the
discoverer
is
always
the
result
of
long
brooding
over
the
most
patient
observations
must
come
at
its
own
moments
and
can
not
be
commanded
the
activity
of
poets
and
discoverers
would
be
paralyzed
by
exigencies
which
stimulate
the
activity
of
soldiers
and
men
of
business
the
truth
is
that
intelligence
and
energy
are
beneficially
stimulated
by
pressure
from
without
whereas
the
working
of
the
higher
intellect
is
impeded
by
it
and
that
to
such
a
degree
that
in
times
of
the
greatest
pressure
the
high
intellectual
life
is
altogether
suspended
to
leave
free
play
to
the
lower
but
more
immediately
serviceable
intelligence
this
being
so
it
becomes
a
necessary
part
of
the
art
of
intellectual
living
so
to
order
our
work
as
to
shield
ourselves
if
possible
at
least
during
a
certain
portion
of
our
time
from
the
evil
consequences
of
hurry
the
whole
secret
lies
in
a
single
word
selection
an
excellent
landscape
painter
told
me
that
whatever
he
had
to
do
he
always
took
the
greatest
pains
to
arrange
his
work
so
as
never
to
have
his
tranquillity
disturbed
by
haste
his
system
which
is
quite
applicable
to
many
other
things
than
landscape
painting
was
based
on
the
principle
of
selection
he
always
took
care
to
determine
beforehand
how
much
time
he
could
devote
to
each
sketch
or
study
and
then
from
the
mass
of
natural
facts
before
him
selected
the
most
valuable
facts
which
could
be
recorded
in
the
time
at
his
disposal
but
however
short
that
time
might
be
he
was
always
perfectly
cool
and
deliberate
in
the
employment
of
it
indeed
this
coolness
and
his
skill
in
selection
helped
each
other
mutually
for
he
chose
wisely
because
he
was
cool
and
he
had
time
to
be
cool
by
reason
of
the
wisdom
of
his
selection
in
his
little
memoranda
done
in
five
minutes
the
lines
were
laid
just
as
deliberately
as
the
tints
on
an
elaborate
picture
the
difference
being
in
choice
only
not
in
speed
now
if
we
apply
this
art
of
selection
to
all
our
labors
it
will
give
us
much
of
that
landscape
painter
enviable
coolness
and
enable
us
to
work
more
satisfactorily
suppose
that
instead
of
painting
and
sketching
we
have
to
do
a
great
deal
of
reading
and
writing
the
art
is
to
select
the
reading
which
will
be
most
useful
to
our
purpose
and
in
writing
to
select
the
words
which
will
express
our
meaning
with
the
greatest
clearness
in
a
little
space
the
art
of
reading
is
to
skip
judiciously
whole
libraries
may
be
skipped
in
these
days
when
we
have
the
results
of
them
in
our
modern
culture
without
going
over
the
ground
again
and
even
of
the
books
we
decide
to
read
there
are
almost
always
large
portions
which
do
not
concern
us
and
which
we
are
sure
to
forget
the
day
after
we
have
read
them
the
art
is
to
skip
all
that
does
not
concern
us
whilst
missing
nothing
that
we
really
need
no
external
guidance
can
teach
us
this
for
nobody
but
ourselves
can
guess
what
the
needs
of
our
intellect
may
be
but
let
us
select
with
decisive
firmness
independently
of
other
people
advice
independently
of
the
authority
of
custom
in
every
newspaper
that
comes
to
hand
there
is
a
little
bit
that
we
ought
to
read
the
art
is
to
find
that
little
bit
and
waste
no
time
over
the
rest
some
studies
permit
the
exercise
of
selection
better
than
others
do
a
language
once
undertaken
permits
very
little
selection
indeed
since
you
must
know
the
whole
vocabulary
or
nearly
so
to
be
able
to
read
and
speak
on
the
other
hand
the
natural
sciences
permit
the
most
prudent
exercise
of
selection
for
example
in
botany
you
may
study
as
few
plants
as
you
choose
in
writing
the
art
of
selection
consists
in
giving
the
utmost
effect
to
expression
in
the
fewest
words
but
of
this
art
i
say
little
for
who
can
contend
against
an
inevitable
almost
every
author
of
ordinary
skill
could
when
pressed
for
time
find
a
briefer
expression
for
his
thoughts
but
the
real
difficulty
in
fulfilling
literary
engagements
does
not
lie
in
the
expression
of
the
thought
it
lies
in
the
sufficiently
rapid
production
of
a
certain
quantity
of
copy
for
this
purpose
i
fear
that
selection
would
be
of
very
little
use
of
no
more
use
in
fact
than
in
any
other
branch
of
manufacture
where
if
a
certain
standard
is
kept
up
to
quantity
in
sale
is
more
important
than
quality
of
material
letter
to
a
friend
who
though
he
had
no
profession
could
not
find
time
for
his
various
intellectual
pursuits
compensations
resulting
from
the
necessity
for
time
opportunity
only
exists
for
us
so
far
as
we
have
time
to
make
use
of
it
this
that
not
this
that
danger
of
apparently
unlimited
opportunities
the
intellectual
training
of
our
ancestors
montaigne
the
essayist
reliance
upon
the
compensations
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
great
and
beautiful
principle
of
compensation
is
more
clearly
seen
in
the
distribution
and
effects
of
time
than
in
anything
else
within
the
scope
of
our
experience
the
good
use
of
one
opportunity
very
frequently
compensates
us
for
the
absence
of
another
and
it
does
so
because
opportunity
is
itself
so
dependent
upon
time
that
although
the
best
opportunities
may
apparently
be
presented
to
us
we
can
make
no
use
of
them
unless
we
are
able
to
give
them
the
time
that
they
require
you
who
have
the
best
possible
opportunities
for
culture
find
a
certain
sadness
and
disappointment
because
you
can
not
avail
yourself
of
all
of
them
but
the
truth
is
that
opportunity
only
exists
for
us
just
so
far
as
we
are
able
to
make
use
of
it
and
our
power
to
do
so
is
often
nothing
but
a
question
of
time
if
our
days
are
well
employed
we
are
sure
to
have
done
some
good
thing
which
we
should
have
been
compelled
to
neglect
if
we
had
been
occupied
about
anything
else
hence
every
genuine
worker
has
rich
compensations
which
ought
to
console
him
amply
for
his
shortcomings
and
to
enable
him
to
meet
comparisons
without
fear
those
who
aspire
to
the
intellectual
life
but
have
no
experience
of
its
difficulties
very
frequently
envy
men
so
favorably
situated
as
you
are
it
seems
to
them
that
all
the
world
knowledge
is
accessible
to
you
and
that
you
have
simply
to
cull
its
fruits
as
we
gather
grapes
in
a
vineyard
they
forget
the
power
of
time
and
the
restrictions
which
time
imposes
this
that
not
this
that
is
the
rule
to
which
all
of
us
have
to
submit
and
it
strangely
equalizes
the
destinies
of
men
the
time
given
to
the
study
of
one
thing
is
withdrawn
from
the
study
of
another
and
the
hours
of
the
day
are
limited
alike
for
all
of
us
how
difficult
it
is
to
reconcile
the
interests
of
our
different
pursuits
indeed
it
seems
like
a
sort
of
polygamy
to
different
pursuits
it
is
natural
to
think
of
them
as
jealous
wives
tormenting
some
mormon
prophet
there
is
great
danger
in
apparently
unlimited
opportunities
and
a
splendid
compensation
for
those
who
are
confined
by
circumstances
to
a
narrow
but
fruitful
field
the
englishman
gets
more
civilization
out
of
a
farm
and
a
garden
than
the
red
indian
out
of
the
space
encircled
by
his
horizon
our
culture
gains
in
thoroughness
what
it
loses
in
extent
this
consideration
goes
far
to
explain
the
fact
that
although
our
ancestors
were
so
much
less
favorably
situated
than
we
are
they
often
got
as
good
an
intellectual
training
from
the
literature
that
was
accessible
to
them
as
we
from
our
vaster
stores
we
live
in
an
age
of
essayists
and
yet
what
modern
essayist
writes
better
than
old
montaigne
all
that
a
thoughtful
and
witty
writer
needs
for
the
sharpening
of
his
intellect
montaigne
found
in
the
ancient
literature
that
was
accessible
to
him
and
in
the
life
of
the
age
he
lived
in
born
in
our
own
century
he
would
have
learned
many
other
things
no
doubt
and
read
many
other
books
but
these
would
have
absorbed
the
hours
that
he
employed
not
less
fruitfully
with
the
authors
that
he
loved
in
the
little
library
up
in
the
third
story
of
his
tower
as
he
tells
us
where
he
could
see
all
his
books
at
once
set
upon
five
rows
of
shelves
round
about
him
in
earlier
life
he
bought
this
sort
of
furniture
for
ornament
and
outward
show
but
afterwards
quite
abandoned
that
and
procured
such
volumes
only
as
supplied
his
own
need
to
supply
our
own
need
within
the
narrow
limits
of
the
few
and
transient
hours
that
we
can
call
our
own
is
enough
for
the
wise
everywhere
as
it
was
for
montaigne
in
his
tower
let
us
resolve
to
do
as
much
as
that
not
more
and
then
rely
upon
the
golden
compensations
supposing
that
the
executive
and
critical
powers
always
exist
in
some
correspondent
degree
in
the
same
person
still
they
can
not
be
cultivated
to
the
same
extent
the
attention
required
for
the
development
of
a
theory
is
necessarily
withdrawn
from
the
design
of
a
drawing
and
the
time
devoted
to
the
realization
of
a
form
is
lost
to
the
solution
of
a
mr
ruskin
the
preface
to
the
third
volume
in
the
case
of
ruskin
in
that
of
dante
rossetti
and
in
all
cases
where
the
literary
and
artistic
gifts
are
naturally
pretty
evenly
balanced
the
preponderance
of
an
hour
a
day
given
to
one
or
the
other
class
of
studies
may
have
settled
the
question
whether
the
student
was
to
be
chiefly
artist
or
chiefly
author
the
enormous
importance
of
the
distribution
of
time
is
never
more
clearly
manifested
than
in
cases
of
this
kind
ruskin
might
certainly
have
attained
rank
as
a
painter
rossetti
might
have
been
as
prolific
in
poetry
as
he
is
excellent
what
these
gifted
men
are
now
is
not
so
much
a
question
of
talent
as
of
time
in
like
manner
the
question
whether
ingres
was
to
be
known
as
a
painter
or
as
a
violinist
was
settled
by
the
employment
of
hours
rather
than
by
any
preponderance
of
faculty
footnotes
being
astonished
at
the
prodigious
variety
and
at
the
extent
of
knowledge
possessed
by
the
germans
i
begged
one
of
my
friends
saxon
by
birth
and
one
of
the
foremost
geologists
in
europe
to
tell
me
how
his
countrymen
managed
to
know
so
many
things

his
answer

his
own
words
german

myself

am

idlest

gets
up
early
summer
and
winter
at
about
five
he
works
four
hours
before
breakfast
sometimes
smoking
all
the
time
which
does
not
interfere
with
his
application
his
breakfast
lasts
half
an
hour
and
he
remains
afterwards
another
talking
with
his
wife
and
playing
with
his
children
he
returns
to
his
work
for
six
hours
dines
without
hurrying
himself
smokes
an
hour
after
dinner
playing
again
with
his
children
and
before
he
goes
to
bed
he
works
four
hours
more
he
begins
again
every
day
and
never
goes
out
this
is
how
it
comes
to
pass
that
oersted
the
greatest
natural
philosopher
in
germany
is
at
the
same
time
the
greatest
physician

carpenter
franz

it
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
very
remarkable
and
noteworthy
circumstance
that
although
beckford
the
author
of
vathek
produced
in
his
youth
a
story
which
bears
all
the
signs
of
true
inventive
genius
he
never
produced
anything
in
which
posterity
cares
to
preserve
i
read
vathek
again
quite
recently
to
see
how
far
my
early
enthusiasm
for
it
might
have
been
due
to
that
passion
for
orientalism
which
reigned
amongst
us
many
years
ago
but
this
fresh
perusal
left
an
impression
which
only
genius
leaves
beckford
really
had
invention
and
an
extraordinary
narrative
power
that
such
faculties
after
having
once
revealed
themselves
should
contentedly
have
remained
dormant
ever
afterwards
is
one
of
the
most
curious
facts
in
the
history
of
the
human
mind
and
it
is
the
more
curious
that
beckford
lived
to
a
very
advanced
age
beckford
case
appears
to
have
been
one
of
those
in
which
great
wealth
diminishes
or
wholly
paralyzes
the
highest
energy
of
the
intellect
leaving
the
lower
energies
free
to
exert
less
noble
kinds
of
activity
a
refined
became
the
habit
of
his
life
and
he
developed
simply
into
a
dilettant
even
his
love
for
the
fine
arts
did
not
rise
above
the
indulgence
of
an
elegant
and
cultivated
taste
although
he
lived
at
the
very
time
most
favorable
to
the
appearance
of
a
great
critic
in
architecture
and
painting
the
time
of
a
great
architectural
revival
and
of
the
growth
of
a
vigorous
and
independent
school
of
contemporary
art
he
exercised
no
influence
beyond
that
of
a
wealthy
virtuoso
his
love
of
the
beautiful
began
and
ended
in
simple
personal
gratification
it
led
to
no
noble
labor
to
no
elevating
severity
of
discipline
englishman
though
he
was
he
filled
his
oriental
tower
with
masterpieces
from
italy
and
holland
only
to
add
form
and
color
to
the
luxuries
of
his
reverie
behind
his
gilded
lattices
and
when
he
raised
that
other
tower
at
fonthill
and
the
slaves
of
the
lamp
toiled
at
it
by
torchlight
to
gratify
his
oriental
impatience
he
exercised
no
influence
upon
the
confusion
of
his
epoch
more
durable
than
that
hundred
yards
of
masonry
which
sank
into
a
shapeless
heap
whilst
as
yet
azrael
spared
its
author
he
to
whom
nature
and
fortune
had
been
so
prodigal
of
their
gifts
he
whom
reynolds
painted
and
mozart
instructed
who
knew
the
poets
of
seven
literatures
culling
their
jewels
like
flowers
in
seven
enchanted
gardens
he
to
whom
the
palaces
of
knowledge
all
opened
their
golden
gates
even
in
his
earliest
youth
to
whom
were
also
given
riches
and
length
of
days
for
whom
a
thousand
craftsmen
toiled
in
europe
and
a
thousand
slaves
beyond
the
sea
what
has
this
gifted
mortal
left
as
the
testimony
of
his
power
as
the
trace
of
his
fourscore
years
upon
the
earth
only
the
reminiscence
of
a
vague
splendor
like
the
recollection
of
a
cloud
that
burned
at
sunset
and
one
small
gem
of
intellectual
creation
that
lives
like
a
tiny
star
if
wealth
had
only
pleasure
to
offer
as
a
temptation
from
intellectual
labor
its
influence
would
be
easier
to
resist
men
of
the
english
race
are
often
grandly
strong
in
resistance
to
every
form
of
voluptuousness
the
race
is
fond
of
comfort
and
convenience
but
it
does
not
sacrifice
its
energy
to
enervating
there
is
however
another
order
of
temptations
in
great
wealth
to
which
englishmen
not
only
yield
but
yield
with
a
satisfied
conscience
even
with
a
sense
of
obedience
to
duty
wealth
carries
pleasure
in
her
left
hand
but
in
her
right
she
bears
honor
and
power
the
rich
man
feels
that
he
can
do
so
much
by
the
mere
exercise
of
his
command
over
the
labor
of
others
and
so
little
by
any
unaided
labor
of
his
own
that
he
is
always
strongly
tempted
to
become
not
only
physically
but
intellectually
a
director
of
work
rather
that
a
workman
even
his
modesty
when
he
is
modest
tends
to
foster
his
reliance
on
others
rather
than
himself
all
that
he
tries
to
do
is
done
so
much
better
by
those
who
make
it
their
profession
that
he
is
always
tempted
to
fall
back
upon
his
paying
power
as
his
most
satisfactory
and
effective
force
there
are
cases
in
which
this
temptation
is
gloriously
overcome
where
men
of
great
wealth
compel
every
one
to
acknowledge
that
their
money
is
nothing
more
than
a
help
to
their
higher
life
like
the
charger
that
bore
wellington
at
waterloo
serving
him
indeed
usefully
but
not
detracting
from
the
honor
which
is
his
due
but
in
these
cases
the
life
is
usually
active
or
administrative
rather
than
intellectual
the
rich
man
does
not
generally
feel
tempted
to
enter
upon
careers
in
which
his
command
over
labor
is
not
an
evident
advantage
and
this
because
men
naturally
seek
those
fields
in
which
their
superiorities
tell
even
the
well
known
instance
of
lord
rosse
can
scarcely
be
considered
an
exception
to
this
rule
for
although
he
was
eminent
in
a
science
which
has
been
followed
by
poor
men
with
great
distinction
his
wealth
was
of
use
in
the
construction
of
his
colossal
telescope
which
gave
him
a
clear
advantage
over
merely
professional
contemporaries
besides
this
natural
desire
to
pursue
careers
in
which
their
money
may
lessen
the
number
of
competitors
the
rich
are
often
diverted
from
purely
intellectual
pursuits
by
the
social
duties
of
their
station
duties
which
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
and
difficult
to
keep
within
limits
the
duchess
of
orleans
mother
of
the
present
count
of
paris
arranged
her
time
with
the
greatest
care
so
as
to
reserve
a
little
of
it
for
her
own
culture
in
uninterrupted
solitude
by
an
exact
system
and
the
exercise
of
the
rarest
firmness
she
contrived
to
steal
half
an
hour
here
and
an
hour
there
enough
no
doubt
when
employed
as
she
employed
them
to
maintain
her
character
as
a
very
distinguished
lady
yet
still
far
from
sufficient
for
the
satisfactory
pursuit
of
any
great
art
or
science
if
it
be
difficult
for
the
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
is
also
difficult
for
him
to
secure
that
freedom
from
interruption
which
is
necessary
to
fit
him
for
his
entrance
into
the
intellectual
kingdom
he
can
scarcely
allow
himself
to
be
absorbed
in
any
great
study
when
he
reflects
on
all
the
powerful
means
of
social
influence
which
he
is
suffering
to
lie
idle
he
is
sure
to
possess
by
inheritance
or
to
have
acquired
in
obedience
to
custom
a
complicated
and
expensive
machinery
for
the
pleasures
and
purposes
of
society
there
is
game
to
be
shot
there
are
hunters
to
be
exercised
great
houses
to
be
filled
with
guests
so
much
is
expected
of
the
rich
man
both
in
business
and
in
pleasure
that
his
time
is
not
his
own
and
he
could
not
quit
his
station
if
he
would
and
yet
the
intellectual
life
in
its
fruitful
perfection
requires
i
do
not
say
the
complete
abandonment
of
the
world
but
it
assuredly
requires
free
and
frequent
spaces
of
labor
in
tranquil
solitude
retreats
like
those
commanded
by
the
church
of
rome
but
with
more
of
study
and
less
of
contemplation
it
would
be
useless
to
ask
you
to
abdicate
your
power
and
retreat
into
some
hermitage
with
a
library
and
a
laboratory
without
a
thought
of
returning
to
your
pleasant
hall
in
yorkshire
and
your
house
in
mayfair
you
will
not
sell
all
and
follow
the
light
but
there
is
a
life
which
you
may
powerfully
encourage
yet
only
partially
share
notwithstanding
the
increased
facilities
for
earning
a
living
which
this
age
offers
to
the
intellectual
the
time
that
they
are
often
compelled
to
give
to
the
satisfaction
of
common
material
necessities
is
so
much
time
withdrawn
from
the
work
which
they
alone
can
do
it
is
a
lamentable
waste
of
the
highest
and
rarest
kind
of
energy
to
compel
minds
that
are
capable
of
original
investigation
of
discovery
to
occupy
themselves
in
that
mere
vulgarization
of
knowledge
in
popular
lecturing
and
literature
which
could
be
done
just
as
efficiently
by
minds
of
a
common
order
it
is
an
error
of
the
present
age
to
believe
that
the
time
for
what
is
called
patronage
is
altogether
passed
away
let
me
mention
two
instances
to
the
contrary
one
in
which
kindly
help
would
have
saved
fifteen
years
of
a
noble
life
another
in
which
that
kindly
help
did
actually
permit
a
man
of
exceptional
endowment
and
equally
exceptional
industry
to
pursue
investigations
for
which
no
other
human
being
was
so
well
qualified
and
which
were
entirely
incompatible
with
the
earning
of
the
daily
bread
carpenter
has
lately
told
us
that
finding
it
impossible
to
unite
the
work
of
a
general
practitioner
with
the
scientific
researches
upon
which
his
heart
was
set
he
gave
up
of
his
time
for
twenty
years
to
popular
lecturing
and
writing
in
order
that
he
might
exist
and
devote
the
other
tenth
to
science
just
as
he
was
breaking
down
from
the
excessive
strain
upon
mind
and
body
which
this
life
involved
an
appointment
was
offered
to
carpenter
which
gave
him
competence
and
sufficient
leisure
for
the
investigations
which
he
has
conducted
to
such
important
issues
suppose
that
during
those
twenty
years
of
struggle
he
broken
down
like
many
another
only
a
little
less
robust
what
then
a
mind
lost
to
his
country
and
the
world
and
would
it
not
have
been
happier
for
him
and
for
us
if
some
of
those
men
of
whom
there
are
more
in
england
than
in
any
other
land
who
are
so
wealthy
that
their
gold
is
positively
a
burden
and
an
encumbrance
like
too
many
coats
in
summer
had
helped
carpenter
at
least
a
few
years
earlier
in
some
form
that
a
man
of
high
feeling
might
honorably
accept
the
other
example
that
i
shall
mention
is
that
of
franz
woepke
the
mathematician
and
orientalist
a
modest
pension
supplied
by
an
italian
prince
who
was
interested
in
the
history
of
mathematics
gave
woepke
that
peace
which
is
incompatible
with
poverty
and
enabled
him
to
live
grandly
in
his
narrow
lodging
the
noble
intellectual
life
was
not
this
rightly
and
well
done
and
probably
a
much
more
effectual
employment
of
the
power
of
gold
than
if
that
italian
prince
had
added
some
rare
manuscripts
to
his
own
library
without
having
time
or
knowledge
to
decipher
them
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
rich
may
serve
the
cause
of
culture
best
by
a
judicious
exercise
of
patronage
unless
indeed
they
have
within
themselves
the
sense
of
that
irresistible
vocation
which
made
humboldt
use
his
fortune
as
the
servant
of
his
high
ambition
the
humboldts
never
are
too
rich
they
possess
their
gold
and
are
not
possessed
by
it
and
they
are
exempt
from

i
have
been
anxious
for
you
lately
and
venture
to
write
to
you
about
the
reasons
for
this
anxiety
you
are
neither
extravagant
nor
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
your
entire
absorption
in
the
higher
intellectual
pursuits
has
produced
in
you
as
it
frequently
does
a
carelessness
about
material
interests
of
all
kinds
which
is
by
far
the
most
dangerous
of
all
tempers
to
the
pecuniary
of
a
man
sydney
smith
declared
that
no
fortune
could
stand
that
temper
long
and
that
we
are
on
the
high
road
to
ruin
the
moment
we
think
ourselves
rich
enough
to
be
careless
let
me
observe
to
begin
with
that
although
the
pursuit
of
wealth
is
not
favorable
to
the
intellectual
life
the
inconveniences
of
poverty
are
even
less
favorable
to
it
we
are
sometimes
lectured
on
the
great
benefits
of
necessity
as
a
stimulant
to
exertion
and
it
is
implied
that
comfortable
people
would
go
much
farther
on
the
road
to
distinction
if
they
were
made
uncomfortable
by
having
to
think
perpetually
about
money
those
who
say
this
confound
together
the
industry
of
the
industrial
and
professional
classes
and
the
labors
of
the
more
purely
intellectual
it
is
clear
that
when
the
labor
a
man
does
is
of
such
a
nature
that
he
will
be
paid
for
it
in
strict
proportion
to
the
time
and
effort
he
bestows
the
need
of
money
will
be
a
direct
stimulus
to
the
best
exertion
he
may
be
capable
of
in
all
simple
industrial
occupations
the
need
of
money
drive
a
man
forwards
and
is
often
when
he
feels
it
in
early
life
the
very
origin
and
foundation
of
his
fortune
there
exists
in
such
occupations
a
perfect
harmony
between
the
present
necessity
and
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
life
wealth
is
the
object
of
industry
and
the
first
steps
towards
the
possession
of
it
are
steps
on
the
chosen
path
the
future
captain
of
industry
who
will
employ
thousands
of
workpeople
and
accumulate
millions
of
money
is
going
straight
to
his
splendid
future
when
he
gets
up
at
five
in
the
morning
to
work
in
another
person
factory
to
learn
to
be
a
builder
of
it
is
necessary
even
when
you
begin
with
capital
to
pass
through
the
manual
trades
and
you
will
only
learn
them
the
better
if
the
wages
are
necessary
to
your
existence
poverty
in
these
cases
only
makes
an
intelligent
man
ground
himself
all
the
better
in
that
stern
practical
training
which
is
the
basis
of
his
future
career
well
therefore
may
those
who
have
reached
distinguished
success
in
fields
of
practical
activity
extol
the
teachings
of
adversity
if
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
your
education
that
you
should
hammer
rivets
inside
a
it
is
as
well
that
your
early
habits
should
not
be
so
it
is
observed
that
horny
hands
in
the
colonies
get
gold
into
them
sooner
than
white
ones
even
in
the
liberal
professions
young
men
get
on
all
the
better
for
not
being
too
comfortably
off
if
you
have
a
comfortable
private
income
to
begin
with
the
meagre
early
rewards
of
professional
life
will
seem
too
paltry
to
be
worth
hard
striving
and
so
you
will
very
likely
miss
the
more
ample
rewards
of
maturity
since
the
common
road
to
success
is
nothing
but
a
gradual
increase
and
you
miss
education
at
the
same
time
for
practice
is
the
best
of
professional
educators
and
many
successful
lawyers
and
artists
have
had
scarcely
any
other
training
the
daily
habit
of
affairs
trains
men
for
the
active
business
of
the
world
and
if
the
purpose
of
their
lives
is
merely
to
do
what
they
are
doing
or
to
command
others
to
do
the
same
things
the
more
closely
circumstances
tie
them
down
to
their
work

earning
has
an
entirely
different
result
it
comes
not
as
an
educator
but
as
an
interruption
or
suspension
of
education
all
intellectual
lives
however
much
they
may
differ
in
the
variety
of
their
purposes
have
at

this
purpose

they

an
intellectual
man
who
is
forty
years
old
is
as
much
at
school
as
an
etonian
of
fourteen
and
if
you
set
him
to
earn
more
money
than
that
which
comes
to
him
without
especial
care
about
it
you
interrupt
his
schooling
exactly
as
selfish
parents
used
to
do
when
they
sent
their
young
children
to
the
factory
and
prevented
them
from
learning
to
read
the
idea
of
the
intellectual
life
is
an
existence
passed
almost
entirely
in
study
yet
preserving
the
results
of
its
investigations
a
day
writing
will
usually
suffice

record
the
outcome
of
a
month

necessity

them
whenever
her
harsh
voice

that

in

the
man
of
science
has
to
abandon
the
pursuit
of
a
discovery
to
go
and
deliver
a
popular

a
hundred

off
for
which
he
gets
five

the
student
of
ancient
literature
has
to
read
some
feeble
novel
and
give
three
days
of
a
valuable
life
to
write
an
anonymous

nothing

and
vitiate
the
public
taste
the
poet
suspends
his
poem
which
is
promised
to
a
publisher
for
christmas
and
will
be
spoiled
in
consequence
by
hurry
at
the
last
in
order
to
write
newspaper
articles
on
subjects
of
which
he
has
little
knowledge
and
in
which
he
takes
no
interest
and
yet
these
are
instances
of
those
comparatively
happy
and
fortunate
needy
who
are
only
compelled
to
suspend
their
intellectual
life
and
who
can
cheer
themselves
in
their
enforced
labor
with
the
hope
of
shortly
renewing
it
what
of
those
others
who
are
pushed
out
of
their
path
forever
by
the
buffets
of
unkindly
fortune
many
a
fine
intellect
has
been
driven
into
the
deep
quagmire
and
has
struggled
in
it
vainly
till
death
came
which
but
for
that
grim
necessity
might
have
scaled
the
immortal
mountains
this
metaphor
of
the
mountains
has
led
me
by
a
natural
association
of
ideas
to
think
of
a
writer
who
has
added
to
our
enjoyment
of
their
beauty
and
i
think
of
him
the
more
readily
that
his
career
will
serve
as
an
illustration
far
better
than
any
imaginary
career
of
the
very
subject
which
just
now
occupies
my
mind
ruskin
is
not
only
one
of
the
best
instances
but
he
is
positively
the
very
best
instance
except
the
two
humboldts
of
an
intellectual
career
which
has
been
greatly
aided
by
material
prosperity
and
which
would
not
have
been
possible
without
it
this
does
not
in
the
least
detract
from
the
merit
of
the
author
of
modern
painters
for
it
needed
a
rare
force
of
resolution
or
a
powerful
instinct
of
genius
to
lead
the
life
of
a
severe
student
under
every
temptation
to
indolence
still
it
is
true
that
career
would
have
been
impossible
for
a
poor
man
however
gifted
a
poor
man
would
not
have
had
access
to
ruskin
materials
and
one
of
his
chief
superiorities
has
always
been
an
abundant
wealth
of
material
and
if
we
go
so
far
as
to
suppose
that
the
poor
man
might
have
found
other
materials
perhaps
equivalent
to
these
we
know
that
he
could
not
have
turned
them
to
that
noble
use
the
poor
critic
would
be
immediately
absorbed
in
the
ocean
of
anonymous
periodical
literature
he
could
not
find
time
for
the
incubation
of
great
works
modern
painters
the
result
of
seventeen
years
of
study
is
not
simply
a
work
of
genius
but
of
genius
seconded
by
wealth
close
to
it
on
my
shelves
stand
four
volumes
which
are
the
monument
of
another
intellectual
life
devoted
to
the
investigation
of
nature
de
saussure
whom
ruskin
reverences
as
one
of
his
ablest
teachers
and
whom
all
sincere
students
of
nature
regard
as
a
model
observer
pursued
for
many
laborious
years
a
kind
of
life
which
was
not
and
could
not
be
in
the
pecuniary
sense
many
other
patient
laborers
who
have
not
the
celebrity
of
these
work
steadily
in
the
same
way
and
are
enabled
to
do
so
by
the
possession
of
independent
fortune
i
know
one
such
who
gives
a
whole
summer
to
the
examination
of
three
or
four
acres
of
the
tangible
result
being
comprised
in
a
few
memoranda
which
considered
as
literary
material
might
in
the
hands
of
a
skilled
professional
writer
just
possibly
be
worth
five
pounds
not
only
do
narrow
pecuniary
means
often
render
high
intellectual
enterprises
absolutely
impossible
but
they
do
what
is
frequently
even
more
trying
to
the
health
and
character
they
permit
you
to
undertake
work
that
would
be
worthy
of
you
if
you
might
only
have
time
and
materials
for
the
execution
of
it
and
then
spoil
it
in
the
doing
an
intellectual
laborer
will
bear
anything
except
that
you
may
take
away
the
very
table
he
is
writing
upon
if
you
let
him
have
a
deal
board
for
his
books
and
papers
you
may
take
away
all
his
fine
editions
if
you
leave
him
common
copies
that
are
legible
you
may
remove
his
very
candlestick
if
you
leave
him
a
to
stick
his
candle
in
and
he
will
go
on
working
cheerfully
still
but
the
moment
you
do
anything
to
spoil
the
quality
of
the
work
itself
you
make
him
irritable
and
miserable
you
think
says
sir
arthur
helps
to
gain
a
good
man
to
manage
your
affairs
because
he
happens
to
have
a
small
share
in
your
undertaking
it
is
a
great
error
you
want
him
to
do
something
well
which
you
are
going
to
tell
him
to
do
if
he
has
been
wisely
chosen
and
is
an
able
man
his
pecuniary
interest
in
the
matter
will
be
mere
dust
in
the
balance
when
compared
with
the
desire
which
belongs
to
all
such
men
to
do
their
work
well
yes
this
is
the
central
passion
of
all
men
of
true
ability
do
their
work
their
happiness
lies
in
that
and
not
in
the
amount
of
their
profits
or
even
in
their
reputation
but
then
on
the
other
hand
they
suffer
indescribable
mental
misery
when
circumstances
compel
them
to
do
their
work
less
well
than
they
know
that
under
more
favorable
circumstances
they
would
be
capable
of
doing
it
the
want
of
money
is
in
the
higher
intellectual
pursuits
the
most
common
hindrance
to
thoroughness
and
excellence
of
work
de
sénancour
who
in
consequence
of
a
strange
concatenation
of
misfortunes
was
all
his
life
struggling
in
shallows
suffered
not
from
the
privations
themselves
but
from
the
vague
feeling
that
they
stunted
his
intellectual
growth
and
any
experienced
student
of
human
nature
must
be
aware
that
de
sénancour
was
right
with
larger
means
he
would
have
seen
more
of
the
world
and
known
it
better
and
written
of
it
with
riper
wisdom
he
said
that
the
man
who
only
saw
in
poverty
the
direct
effect
of
the
and
only
compared
for
instance
an
dinner
to
one
that
cost
ten
shillings
would
have
no
conception
of
the
true
nature
of
misfortune
for
not
to
spend
money
is
the
least
of
the
evils
of
poverty
bossuet
said
that
he
had
no
attachment
to
riches
and
still
if
he
had
only
what
is
barely
necessary
if
he
felt
himself
narrowed
he
would
lose
more
than
half
his
talents
said
only
think
a
little
what
a
difference
there
is
in
the
starting
point
and
in
the
employment
of
the
faculties
between
a
duc
de
luynes
and
a
sénancour
how
many
of
the
most
distinguished
authors
have
been
dependent
upon
private
means
not
simply
for
physical
sustenance
but
for
the
opportunities
which
they
afforded
of
gaining
that
experience
of
life
which
was
absolutely
essential
to
the
full
growth
of
their
mental
faculties

could
not

hundred
buyers
yet
his
was
employed
in

for

nothing
my

have
been
an
expense
to
the
pecuniary
rewards
which
men
receive
for
their
labor
are
so
absurdly
yet
inevitably
disproportionate
to
the
intellectual
power
that
is
needed
for
the
task
and
also
to
the
toil
involved
that
no
one
can
safely
rely
upon
the
higher
intellectual
pursuits
as
a
protection
from
i
will
give
you
two
instances
of
this
disproportion
real
instances
of
men
who
are
known
to
me
personally
one
of
them
is
an
eminent
englishman
of
most
remarkable
intellectual
force
who
for
many
years
past
has
occupied
his
leisure
in
the
composition
of
works
that
are
valued
by
the
thinking
public
to
a
degree
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
exaggerate
but
this
thinking
public
is
not
numerous
and
so
in
the
year
this
eminent
philosopher
unable
to
continue
losing
money
in
endeavoring
to
enlighten
his
contemporaries
was
compelled
to
announce
the
termination
of
his
series
on
the
other
hand
a
frenchman
also
known
to
me
personally
one
day
conceived
the
fortunate
idea
that
a
new
primer
might
possibly
be
a
saleable
commodity
so
he
composed
a
little
primer
beginning
with
the
alphabet
advancing
to
a
b
b
a
and
even
going
so
far
in
history
as
to
affirm
that
adam
was
the
first
man
and
abraham
the
father
of
the
faithful
he
had
the
wisdom
to
keep
the
copyright
of
this
little
publication
which
employed
in
the
easiest
of
all
imaginable
literary
labor
the
evenings
of
a
single
week
it
has
brought
him
in
ever
since
a
regular
income
of
a
year
which
so
far
from
showing
any
signs
of
diminution
is
positively
improving
this
success
encouraged
the
same
intelligent
gentleman
to
compose
more
literature
of
the
same
order
and
he
is
now
the
enviable
owner
of
several
other
such
copyrights
all
of
them
very
valuable
in
fact
as
good
properties
as
in
london
here
is
an
author
who
from
the
pecuniary
point
of
view
was
incomparably
more
successful
than
milton
or
shelley
or
goethe
if
every
intellectual
man
could
shield
his
higher
life
by
writing
primers
for
children
which
should
be
as
good
as
if
the
proverb
peut
le
plus
peut
le
were
a
true
proverb
which
it
is
not
then
of
course
all
men
of
culture
would
be
perfectly
safe
since
they
all
certainly
know
the
contents
of
a
primer
but
you
may
be
able
to
write
the
most
learned
philosophical
treatise
and
still
not
be
able
to
earn
your
daily
bread
consider
too
the
lamentable
loss
of
time
which
people
of
high
culture
incur
in
making
experiments
on
public
taste
when
money
becomes
one
of
their
main
objects
whilst
they
are
writing
stories
for
children
or
elementary
educational
books
which
people
of
far
inferior
attainment
could
probably
do
much
better
their
own
comes
to
a
standstill
if
it
could
only
be
ascertained
without
delay
what
sort
of
work
would
bring
in
the
money
they
require
then
there
would
be
some
chance
of
apportioning
time
so
as
to
make
reserves
for
but
when
they
have
to
write
a
score
of
volumes
merely
to
ascertain
the
humor
of
the
public
there
is
little
chance
of
leisure
the
life
of
the
professional
author
who
has
no
reputation
is
much
less
favorable
to
high
culture
than
the
life
of
a
tradesman
in
moderately
easy
circumstances
who
can
reserve
an
hour
or
two
every
day
for
some
beloved
intellectual
pursuit
tells
us
that
during
certain
years
of
his
life
he
had
endeavored
and
had
been
able
so
to
arrange
his
existence
that
it
should
have
both
sweetness
and
dignity
writing
from
time
to
time
what
was
agreeable
reading
what
was
both
agreeable
and
serious
cultivating
friendships
throwing
much
of
his
mind
into
the
intimate
relations
of
every
day
giving
more
to
his
friends
than
to
the
public
reserving
what
was
most
tender
and
delicate
for
the
inner
life
enjoying
with
moderation
such
for
him
was
the
dream
of
an
intellectual
existence
in
which
things
truly
precious
were
valued
according
to
their
worth
and
he
said
above
all
his
desire
was
not
to
write
too
much
ne
pas
trop
and
then
comes
the
regret
for
this
wise
life
enjoyed
by
him
only
for
a
time
la
nécessité
depuis
saisi
et
contraint
de
renoncer
à
ce
que
je
considérais

lamented
in
like
manner
the
evil
intellectual
consequences
of
anxieties
about
material
needs
there
is
nothing
he
said
more
mortal
to
my
mind
than
the
necessity
pushed
to
a
certain
degree
to
have
to
think
each
day
about
a
provision
for
the
next
happily
i
think
little
and
rarely
about
all
that
but
whenever
this
happens
to
me
i
pass
through
moments
of
discouragement
and
positive
despair
which
if
the
influence
of
them
became
habitual
make
me
renounce
all
my
labors
all
my
philosophical
projects
to
end
my
days
like
an
there
are
a
hundred
rules
for
getting
rich
but
the
instinct
of
accumulation
is
worth
all
such
rules
put
together
this
instinct
is
rarely
found
in
combination
with
high
intellectual
gifts
and
the
reason
is
evident
to
advance
from
a
hundred
pounds
to
a
thousand
is
not
an
intellectual
advance
and
there
is
no
intellectual
interest
in
the
addition
of
a
cipher
at
the
bankers
simply
to
accumulate
money
that
you
are
never
to
use
is
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
as
stupid
an
operation
as
can
be
imagined
we
observe
too
that
the
great
accumulators
the
men
who
are
gifted
by
nature
with
the
true
instinct
are
not
usually
such
persons
as
we
feel
any
ambition
to
become
their
faculties
are
concentrated
on
one
point
and
that
point
as
it
seems
to
us
of
infinitely
little
importance
we
can
not
see
that
it
signifies
much
to
the
intellectual
of
humanity
that
john
smith
should
be
worth
his
million
when
he
dies
since
we
know
quite
well
that
john
smith
mind
will
be
just
as
then
as
it
is
now
in
places
where
much
money
is
made
we
easily
acquire
a
positive
disgust
for
it
and
the
curate
seems
the
most
distinguished
gentleman
in
the
community
with
his
old
black
coat
and
his
seventy
pounds
a
year
we
come
to
hate
when
we
find
that
they
exclude
all
thoughtful
and
disinterested
conversation
and
we
fly
to
the
society
of
people
with
fixed
incomes
not
large
enough
for
much
saving
to
escape
the
perpetual
talk
about
investments
our
happiest
hours
have
been
spent
with
poor
scholars
and
artists
and
men
of
science
whose
words
remain
in
the
memory
and
make
us
rich
indeed
then
we
dislike
money
because
it
rules
and
restrains
us
and
because
it
is
unintelligent
and
seems
hostile
so
far
as
that
which
is
unintelligent
can
be
hostile
and
yet
the
real
truth
is
that
money
is
the
strong
protector
of
the
intellectual
life
the
student
sits
and
studies
too
often
despising
the
power
that
shelters
him
from
the
wintry
night
that
gives
him
roof
and
walls
and
lamp
and
books
and
fire
for
money
is
simply
the
accumulated
labor
of
the
past
guarding
our
peace
as
fleets
and
armies
guard
the
industry
of
england
or
like
some
mighty
within
which
men
follow
the
most
peaceful
avocations
the
art
is
to
use
money
so
that
it
shall
be
the
protector
and
not
the
scatterer
of
our
time

the
sovereign

letter
iii
to
a
student
in
great
poverty
poverty
really
a
great
obstacle
difference
between
a
thousand
rich
men
and
a
thousand
poor
men
taken
from
persons
of
average
natural
gifts
the
houses
of
parliament
the
english
recognize
the
natural
connection
between
wealth
and
culture
connection
between
ignorance
and
parsimony
in
expenditure
what
may
be
honestly
said
for
the
encouragement
of
a
very
poor
student
as
it
seems
to
me
that
to
make
light
of
the
difficulties
which
lie
in
the
path
of
another
is
not
to
show
true
sympathy
for
him
even
though
it
is
done
sometimes
out
of
a
sort
of
awkward
kindness
and
for
his
encouragement
i
will
not
begin
by
pretending
that
poverty
is
not
a
great
obstacle
to
the
perfection
of
the
intellectual
life
it
a
great
obstacle
it
is
one
of
the
very
greatest
of
all
obstacles
only
observe
how
riches
and
poverty
operate
upon
mankind
in
the
mass
here
and
there
no
doubt
a
very
poor
man
attains
intellectual
distinction
when
he
has
exceptional
strength
of
will
and
health
enough
to
bear
a
great
strain
of
extra
labor
that
he
imposes
upon
himself
and
natural
gifts
so
brilliant
that
he
can
learn
in
an
hour
what
common
men
learn
in
a
day
but
consider
mankind
in
the
mass
look
for
instance
at
our
two
houses
of
parliament
they
are
composed
of
men
taken
from
the
average
run
of
englishmen
with
very
little
reference
to
ability
but
almost
all
of
them
are
rich
men
not
one
of
them
is
poor
as
you
are
poor
not
one
of
them
has
to
contend
against
the
stern
realities
of
poverty
then
consider
the
very
high
general
level
of
intellectual
attainment
which
distinguishes
those
two
assemblies
and
ask
yourself
candidly
whether
a
thousand
men
taken
from
the
beggars
in
the
streets
or
even
from
the
far
superior
class
of
our
manufacturing
operatives
would
be
likely
to
understand
as
the
two
houses
of
parliament
understand
the
many
complicated
questions
of
legislation
and
of
policy
which
are
continually
brought
before
them
we
all
know
that
the
poor
are
too
limited
in
knowledge
and
experience
from
the
want
of
the
necessary
opportunities
and
too
little
accustomed
to
exercise
their
minds
in
the
tranquil
investigations
of
great
questions
to
be
competent
for
the
work
of
parliament
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
insist
upon
this
fact
to
an
englishman
because
the
english
have
always
recognized
the
natural
connection
between
wealth
and
culture
and
have
preferred
to
be
governed
by
the
rich
from
the
belief
that
they
are
likely
to
be
better
informed
and
better
situated
for
intellectual
activity
of
a
disinterested
kind
than
those
members
of
the
community
whose
time
and
thoughts
are
almost
entirely
occupied
in
winning
their
daily
bread
by
the
incessant
labor
of
their
hands
and
if
you
go
out
into
the
world
if
you
mix
with
men
of
very
different
classes
you
will
find
that
in
a
broad
average
way
i
am
not
speaking
just
now
of
the
exceptions
the
richer
classes
are
much
more
capable
of
entering
into
the
sort
of
thinking
which
may
be
called
intellectual
than
those
whose
money
is
less
plentiful
and
whose
opportunities
have
therefore
been
less
abundant
indeed
it
may
be
asserted
roughly
and
generally
that
the
narrowness
of
men
ideas
is
in
direct
proportion
to
their
parsimony
in
expenditure
i
do
not
mean
to
affirm
that
all
who
spend
largely
attain
large
intellectual
results
for
of
course
we
know
that
a
man
may
spend
vast
sums
on
pursuits
which
do
not
educate
him
in
anything
worth
knowing
but
the
advantage
is
that
with
habits
of
free
expenditure
the
germs
of
thought
are
well
tilled
and
watered
whereas
parsimony
denies
them
every
external
help
the
most
spending
class
in
europe
is
the
english
gentry
it
is
also
the
class
most
strikingly
characterized
by
a
high
general
average
of
information
the
most
parsimonious
class
in
europe
is
the
french
peasantry
it
is
also
the
class
most
strikingly
characterized
by
ignorance
and
intellectual
apathy
the
english
gentleman
has
cultivated
himself
by
various
reading
and
extensive
travel
but
the
french
peasant
will
not
go
anywhere
except
to
the
and
could
not
pardon
the
extravagance
of
buying
a
book
or
a
candle
to
read
it
by
in
the
evening
between
these
extremes
we
have
various
grades
of
the
middle
classes
in
which
culture
usually
increases
very
much
in
proportion
to
the
expenditure
the
rule
is
not
without
its
exceptions
there
are
rich
vulgar
people
who
spend
a
great
deal
without
improving
themselves
at
all
who
only
by
unlimited
succeed
in
making
themselves
so
uncomfortably
sensitive
to
every
bodily
inconvenience
that
they
have
no
leisure
even
in
the
midst
of
an
unoccupied
life
to
think
of
anything
but
their
own
bellies
and
their
own
skins
people
whose
power
of
attention
is
so
feeble
that
the
smallest
external
incident
distracts
it
and
who
remember
nothing
of
their
travels
but
a
catalogue
of
trivial
annoyances
but
people
of
this
kind
do
not
generally
belong
to
families
on
whom
wealth
has
had
time
to
produce
its
best
effects
what
i
mean
is
that
a
family
which
has
been
for
generations
in
the
habit
of
spending
four
thousand
a
year
will
usually
be
found
to
have
a
more
cultivated
one
than
one
that
has
only
spent
four
hundred
i
have
come
to
the
recognition
of
this
truth
very
reluctantly
indeed
not
because
i
dislike
rich
people
but
merely
because
they
are
necessarily
a
very
small
minority
and
i
should
like
every
human
being
to
have
the
best
benefits
of
culture
if
it
were
only
possible
the
plain
living
and
high
thinking
that
wordsworth
so
much
valued
is
a
cheering
ideal
for
most
men
have
to
live
plainly
and
if
they
could
only
think
with
a
certain
elevation
we
might
hope
to
solve
the
great
problem
of
human
life
the
reconciliation
of
poverty
and
the
soul
there
certainly
is
a
slow
movement
in
that
direction
and
the
shortening
of
the
hours
of
labor
may
afford
some
margin
of
leisure
but
we
who
work
for
culture
every
day
and
all
day
long
and
still
feel
that
we
know
very
little
and
have
hardly
skill
enough
to
make
any
effective
use
of
the
little
that
we
know
can
scarcely
indulge
in
very
enthusiastic
anticipations
of
the
future
culture
of
the
poor
still
there
are
some
things
that
may
be
rationally
and
truly
said
to
a
poor
man
who
desires
culture
and
which
are
not
without
a
sort
of
spartan
encouragement
you
are
restricted
by
your
poverty
but
it
is
not
always
a
bad
thing
to
be
restricted
even
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
the
intellectual
powers
of
people
are
very
commonly
made
ineffective
by
the
enormous
multiplicity
of
objects
that
are
presented
to
their
attention
and
which
claim
from
them
a
sort
of
polite
notice
like
the
greeting
of
a
great
lady
to
each
of
her
thousand
guests
it
requires
the
very
rarest
strength
of
mind
in
a
rich
man
to
concentrate
his
attention
on
anything
there
are
so
many
things
that
he
is
expected
to
make
a
pretence
of
knowing
but
nobody
expects
to
know
anything
and
this
is
an
incalculable
advantage
i
think
that
all
poor
men
who
have
risen
to
subsequent
distinction
have
been
greatly
indebted
to
this
independence
of
public
opinion
as
to
what
they
ought
to
know
in
trying
to
satisfy
that
public
opinion
by
getting
up
a
pretence
of
various
sorts
of
knowledge
which
is
only
a
sham
we
sacrifice
not
only
much
precious
time
but
we
blunt
our
natural
interest
in
things
that
interest
you
preserve
in
all
its
virgin
force
and
this
force
carries
a
man
far
then
again
although
the
opportunities
of
rich
people
are
very
superior
to
yours
they
are
not
altogether
so
superior
as
they
seem
there
exists
a
great
equalizing
power
the
limitation
of
human
energy
a
rich
man
may
sit
down
to
an
enormous
banquet
but
he
can
only
make
a
good
use
of
the
little
that
he
is
able
to
digest
so
it
is
with
the
splendid
intellectual
banquet
that
is
spread
before
the
rich
man
eyes
he
can
only
possess
what
he
has
energy
to
master
and
too
frequently
the
manifest
impossibility
of
mastering
everything
produces
a
feeling
of
discouragement
that
ends
in
his
mastering
nothing
a
poor
student
especially
if
he
lives
in
an
place
where
there
are
no
big
libraries
to
bewilder
him
may
apply
his
energy
with
effect
in
the
study
of
a
few
authors
i
used
to
believe
a
great
deal
more
in
opportunities
and
less
in
application
than
i
do
now
time
and
health
are
needed
but
with
these
there
are
always
opportunities
rich
people
have
a
fancy
for
spending
money
very
uselessly
on
their
culture
because
it
seems
to
them
more
valuable
when
it
has
been
costly
but
the
truth
is
that
by
the
blessing
of
good
and
cheap
literature
intellectual
light
has
become
almost
as
accessible
as
daylight
i
have
a
rich
friend
who
travels
more
and
buys
more
costly
things
than
i
do
but
he
does
not
really
learn
more
or
advance
farther
in
the
twelvemonth
if
my
days
are
fully
occupied
what
has
he
to
set
against
them
only
other
days
no
more
if
he
is
getting
benefit
at
petersburg
he
is
missing
the
benefit
i
am
getting
round
my
house
and
in
it
the
sum
of
the
year
benefit
seems
to
be
surprisingly
alike
in
both
cases
so
if
you
are
reading
a
piece
of
thoroughly
good
literature
baron
rothschild
may
possibly
be
as
well
occupied
as
you
he
is
certainly
not
better
occupied
when
i
open
a
noble
volume
i
say
to
myself
now
the
only
croesus
that
i
envy
is
he
who
is
reading
a
better
book
than
this
footnotes
this
sounds
like
a
poetical
exaggeration
but
it
is
less
than
the
bare
truth
there
were
fifteen
hundred
slaves
on
two
west
indian
estates
that
beckford
lost
in
a
lawsuit
it
is
quite
certain
considering
his
lavish
expenditure
that
fully
a
thousand
men
must
have
worked
for
the
maintenance
of
his
luxury
in
europe
so
much
for
his
command
of
labor
the
reader
will
please
to
bear
in
mind
that
i
am
speaking
here
of
broad
effects
on
great
numbers
i
do
not
think
that
aristocracy
in
its
spirit
is
quite
favorable
to
the
exceptionally
highest
intellectual
life

to
a
young

had
firmly

coat

of
the

and

duty
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
staying
at
your
father
house
you
told
me
rather
to
my
surprise
that
it
was
impossible
for
you
to
go
to
balls
and
because
you
did
not
possess
such
a
thing
as
a
the
reason
struck
me
as
being
scarcely
a
valid
one
considering
the
rather
high
scale
of
expenditure
adopted
in
the
paternal
mansion
it
seemed
clear
that
the
eldest
son
of
a
family
which
lived
after
the
liberal
fashion
of
yorkshire
country
gentlemen
could
afford
himself
a
if
he
liked
then
i
wondered
whether
you
disliked
from
a
belief
that
they
were
unbecoming
to
your
person
but
a
very
little
observation
of
your
character
convinced
me
that
whatever
might
be
your
weaknesses
for
everybody
has
some
weaknesses
anxiety
about
personal
appearance
was
not
one
of
them
the
truth
is
that
you
secretly
enjoy
this
little
piece
of
disobedience
to
custom
and
all
the
disabilities
which
result
from
it
this
little
rebellion
is
connected
with
a
larger
rebellion
and
it
is
agreeable
to
you
to
demonstrate
the
unreasonableness
of
society
by
incurring
a
very
severe
penalty
for
a
very
trifling
offence
you
are
always
dressed
decently
you
offend
against
no
moral
rule
you
have
cultivated
your
mind
by
study
and
reflection
and
it
rather
pleases
you
to
think
that
a
young
gentleman
so
well
qualified
for
society
in
everything
of
real
importance
should
be
excluded
from
it
because
he
has
not
purchased
a
permission
from
his
tailor
the
penalties
imposed
by
society
for
the
infraction
of
very
trifling
details
of
custom
are
often
as
it
seems
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
offence
but
so
are
the
penalties
of
nature
only
three
days
before
the
date
of
this
letter
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
was
coming
home
from
a
day
shooting
his
nephew
a
fine
young
man
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
existence
was
walking
ten
paces
in
advance
a
covey
of
partridges
suddenly
cross
the
road
my
friend
in
shouldering
his
gun
touches
the
trigger
just
a
second
too
soon
and
kills
his
nephew
now
think
of
the
long
years
of
mental
misery
that
will
be
the
punishment
of
that
very
trifling
piece
of
carelessness
my
poor
friend
has
passed
in
the
space
of
a
single
instant
from
a
joyous
life
to
a
life
that
is
permanently
and
irremediably
saddened
it
is
as
if
he
had
left
the
summer
sunshine
to
enter
a
gloomy
dungeon
and
begin
a
perpetual
imprisonment
and
for
what
for
having
touched
a
trigger
without
evil
intention
a
little
too
precipitately
it
seems
harder
still
for
the
victim
who
is
sent
out
of
the
world
in
the
bloom
of
perfect
manhood
because
his
uncle
was
not
quite
so
cool
as
he
ought
to
have
been
again
not
far
from
where
i
live
men
were
killed
last
week
in
a
from
an
explosion
of
one
of
their
number
had
struck
a
lucifer
to
light
his
pipe
for
doing
this
in
a
place
where
he
ought
not
to
have
done
it
the
man
suffers
the
penalty
of
death
and
others
with
him
the
fact
is
simply
that
nature
be
obeyed
and
makes
no
attempt
to
proportion
punishments
to
offences
indeed
what
in
our
human
way
we
call
punishments
are
not
punishments
but
simple
consequences
so
it
is
with
the
great
social
penalties
society
be
if
you
refuse
obedience
you
must
take
the
consequences
society
has
only
one
law
and
that
is
custom
even
religion
itself
is
socially
powerful
only
just
so
far
as
it
has
custom
on
its
side
nature
does
not
desire
that
men
should
be
destroyed
because
one
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
a
pipe
but
is
highly
inflammable
and
the
explosion
is
a
simple
consequence
society
does
not
desire
to
exclude
you
because
you
will
not
wear
evening
dress
but
the
dress
is
customary
and
your
exclusion
is
merely
a
consequence
of
your
nonconformity
the
view
of
society
goes
no
farther
in
this
than
the
artistic
conception
not
very
delicately
artistic
perhaps
that
it
is
prettier
to
see
men
in
black
coats
regularly
placed
between
ladies
round
a
than
men
in
gray
coats
or
brown
coats
the
uniformity
of
costume
appears
to
represent
uniformity
of
sentiment
and
to
ensure
a
sort
of
harmony
amongst
the
what
society
really
cares
for
is
harmony
what
it
dislikes
is
dissent
and
nonconformity
it
wants
peace
in
the
peace
in
the
peace
everywhere
in
its
realm
of
tranquil
pleasure
you
come
in
your
which
was
in
tune
upon
the
moors
but
is
a
dissonance
amongst
ladies
in
full
dress
do
you
not
perceive
that
fustian
and
velveteen
which
were
natural
amongst
gamekeepers
are
not
so
natural
on
gilded
chairs
covered
with
silk
with
lace
and
diamonds
at
a
distance
of
three
feet
you
perceive
it
very
well
society
does
not
argue
the
point
with
you
but
only
excludes
you
it
has
been
said
that
in
the
life
of
every
intellectual
man
there
comes
a
time
when
he
questions
custom
at
all
points
this
seems
to
be
a
provision
of
nature
for
the
reform
and
progress
of
custom
itself
which
without
such
questioning
would
remain
absolutely
stationary
and
irresistibly
despotic
you
rebels
against
the
established
custom
have
your
place
in
the
great
work
of
progressive
civilization
without
you
western
europe
would
have
been
a
second
china
it
is
to
the
continual
rebellion
of
such
persons
as
yourself
that
we
owe
whatever
progress
has
been
accomplished
since
the
times
of
our
remotest
forefathers
there
have
been
rebels
always
and
the
rebels
have
not
been
generally
speaking
the
most
stupid
part
of
the
nation
but
what
is
the
use
of
wasting
this
beneficial
power
of
rebellion
on
matters
too
trivial
to
be
worth
attention
does
it
hurt
your
conscience
to
appear
in
a
certainly
not
and
you
would
be
as
in
it
as
you
are
in
your
velveteen
with
the
pointers
on
the
bronze
buttons
let
us
conform
in
these
trivial
matters
which
nobody
except
a
tailor
ought
to
consider
worth
a
attention
in
order
to
reserve
our
strength
for
the
protection
of
intellectual
liberty
let
society
arrange
your
dress
for
you
it
will
save
you
infinite
trouble
but
never
permit
it
to
stifle
the
expression
of
your
thought
you
find
it
convenient
because
you
are
timid
to
exclude
yourself
from
the
world
by
refusing
to
wear
its
costume
but
a
bolder
man
would
let
the
tailor
do
his
worst
and
then
go
into
the
world
and
courageously
defend
there
the
persons
and
causes
that
are
misunderstood
and
slanderously
misrepresented
the
fables
of
spenser
are
fables
only
in
form
and
a
noble
knight
may
at
any
time
go
forth
armed
in
the
panoply
of
a
a
dress
waistcoat
and
a
manly
moral
courage
to
do
battle
across
the
and
in
the
for
those
who
have
none
to
defend
them
it
is
unphilosophical
to
set
ourselves
obstinately
against
custom
in
the
mass
for
it
multiplies
the
power
of
men
by
settling
useless
discussion
and
clearing
the
ground
for
our
best
and
most
prolific
activity
the
business
of
the
world
could
not
be
carried
forward
one
day
without
a
most
complex
code
of
customs
and
law
itself
is
little
more
than
custom
slightly
improved
upon
by
men
reflecting
together
at
their
leisure
and
reduced
to
codes
and
systems
we
ought
to
think
of
custom
as
a
most
precious
legacy
of
the
past
saving
us
infinite
perplexity
yet
not
as
an
infallible
rule
the
most
intelligent
community
would
be
conservative
in
its
habits
yet
not
obstinately
conservative
but
willing
to
hear
and
adopt
the
suggestions
of
advancing
reason
the
great
duty
of
the
intellectual
class
and
its
especial
function
is
to
confirm
what
is
reasonable
in
the
customs
that
have
been
handed
down
to
us
and
so
maintain
their
authority
yet
at
the
same
time
to
show
that
custom
is
not
final
but
merely
a
form
suited
to
the
world
convenience
and
whenever
you
are
convinced
that
a
custom
is
no
longer
serviceable
the
way
to
procure
the
abolition
of
it
is
to
lead
men
very
gradually
away
from
it
by
offering
a
substitute
at
first
very
slightly
different
from
what
they
have
been
long
used
to
if
the
english
had
been
in
the
habit
of
tattooing
the
best
way
to
procure
its
abolition
would
have
been
to
admit
that
it
was
quite
necessary
to
cover
the
face
with
elaborate
patterns
yet
gently
to
suggest
that
these
patterns
would
be
still
more
elegant
if
delicately
painted
in
then
you
might
have
gone
on
arguing
still
admitting
of
course
the
absolute
necessity
for
ornament
of
some
kind
that
good
taste
demanded
only
a
moderate
amount
of
it
and
so
you
would
have
brought
people
gradually
to
a
little
flourish
on
the
nose
or
forehead
when
the
most
advanced
reformers
might
have
set
the
example
of
dispensing
with
ornament
altogether
many
of
our
contemporaries
have
abandoned
shaving
in
this
gradual
way
allowing
the
whiskers
to
encroach
imperceptibly
till
at
last
the
razor
lay
in
the
unused
the
abominable
black
cylinders
that
covered
our
heads
a
few
years
ago
were
vainly
resisted
by
radicals
in
custom
but
the
moderate
reformers
gradually
reduced
their
elevation
and
now
they
are
things
of
the
past
though
i
think
we
ought
to
submit
to
custom
in
matters
of
indifference
and
to
reform
it
gradually
whilst
affecting
submission
in
matters
altogether
indifferent
still
there
are
other
matters
on
which
the
only
attitude
worthy
of
a
man
is
the
most
bold
and
open
resistance
to
its
dictates
custom
may
have
a
right
to
authority
over
your
wardrobe
but
it
can
not
have
any
right
to
ruin
your
not
only
the
virtues
most
advantageous
to
but
also
the
most
contemptible
and
degrading
vices
have
at
various
periods
of
the
world
history
been
sustained
by
the
full
authority
of
custom
there
are
places
where
forty
years
ago
drunkenness
was
conformity
to
custom
and
sobriety
an
eccentricity
there
are
societies
even
at
the
present
day
where
licentiousness
is
the
rule
of
custom
and
chastity
the
sign
of
weakness
or
want
of
spirit
there
are
communities
it
can
not
be
necessary
to
name
them
in
which
successful
fraud
especially
on
a
large
scale
is
respected
as
the
proof
of
smartness
whilst
a
man
who
remains
poor
because
he
is
honest
is
despised
for
slowness
and
incapacity
there
are
whole
nations
in
which
religious
hypocrisy
is
strongly
approved
by
custom
and
honesty
severely
condemned
the
wahabee
arabs
may
be
mentioned
as
an
instance
of
this
but
the
wahabee
arabs
are
not
the
only
people
nor
is
nejed
the
only
place
where
it
is
held
to
be
more
virtuous
to
lie
on
the
side
of
custom
than
to
be
an
honorable
man
in
independence
of
it
in
all
communities
where
vice
and
hypocrisy
are
sustained
by
the
authority
of
custom
eccentricity
is
a
moral
duty
in
all
communities
where
a
low
standard
of
thinking
is
received
as
infallible
common
sense
eccentricity
becomes
an
intellectual
duty
there
are
hundreds
of
places
in
the
provinces
where
it
is
impossible
for
any
man
to
lead
the
intellectual
life
without
being
condemned
as
an
eccentric
it
is
the
duty
of
intellectual
men
who
are
thus
isolated
to
set
the
example
of
that
which
their
neighbors
call
eccentricity
but
which
may
be
more
accurately
described
as
superiority

for
an
asiatic
people
is
nothing
more
than
a
vast
experiment
has
its
counterpart
in
many
an
individual
life
in
europe
we
are
like
travellers
crossing
an
isthmus
between
two
seas
who
have
left
one
ship
behind
them
who
have
not
yet
seen

of

to
the

there
is
a
break
between
the
existence
of
our
forefathers
and
that
of
our
posterity
and
it
is
we
who
have
the
misfortune
to
be
situated
exactly
where
the
break
occurs
we
are
leaving
behind
us
the
security
i
do
not
say
the
safety
but
the
feeling
of
tranquillity
which
belonged
to
the
ages
of
tradition
we
are
entering
upon
ages
whose
spirit
we
foresee
but
dimly
whose
institutions
are
the
subject
of
guesses
and
conjectures
and
yet
this
future
of
which
we
know
so
little
attracts
us
more
by
the
very
vastness
of
its
enigma
than
the
rich
history
of
the
past
so
full
of
various
incident
of
powerful
personages
of
grandeur
and
suffering
and
sorrow
joubert
already
noticed
this
of
the
modern
mind
the
ancients
he
observed
said
ancestors
we
say
we
do
not
love
as
they
did
the
country
and
laws
of
our
forefathers
we
love
rather
the
laws
and
the
country
of
our
children
it
is
the
magic
of
the
future
and
not
that
of
the
past
which
seduces
us
commenting
on
this
thought
of
joubert
girardin
said
that
we
loved
the
future
because
we
loved
ourselves
and
fashioned
the
future
in
our
own
image
and
he
added
with
partial
but
not
complete
injustice
that
our
ignorance
of
the
past
was
a
cause
of
this
tendency
in
our
minds
since
it
is
shorter
to
despise
the
past
than
to
study
it
these
critics
and
accusers
of
the
modern
spirit
are
not
however
altogether
fair
to
it
if
the
modern
spirit
looks
so
much
to
the
future
it
is
because
the
problems
of
the
past
are
solved
problems
whilst
those
of
the
future
have
the
interest
of
a
game
that
is
only
just
begun
we
know
what
became
of
feudalism
we
know
the
work
that
it
accomplished
and
the
services
that
it
rendered
but
we
do
not
yet
know
what
will
be
the
effects
of
modern
democracy
and
of
the
scientific
and
industrial
spirit
it
is
the
novelty
of
this
element
the
scientific
spirit
and
the
industrial
development
which
is
a
part
but
only
a
part
of
its
results
that
makes
the
past
so
much
less
reliable
as
a
guide
than
it
would
have
been
if
no
new
element
had
intervened
and
therefore
so
much
less
interesting
for
us
as
an
example
of
the
inapplicability
of
past
experience
i
may
mention
an
argument
against
republics
which
has
been
much
used
of
late
by
the
partisans
of
monarchy
in
france
they
have
frequently
told
us
that
republics
had
only
succeeded
in
very
small
states
and
this
is
true
of
ancient
democracies
but
it
is
not
less
true
that
railways
and
telegraphs
and
the
newspaper
press
have
made
great
countries
like
france
and
the
united
states
just
as
capable
of
feeling
and
acting
simultaneously
as
the
smallest
republics
of
antiquity
the
parties
which
rely
on
what
are
called
the
lessons
of
history
are
continually
exposed
to
great
deceptions
in
france
what
may
be
called
the
historical
party
would
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
a
united
germany
because
fifty
years
ago
with
the
imperfect
means
of
communication
which
then
existed
germany
was
not
and
could
not
be
united
the
same
historical
party
refused
to
believe
that
the
italian
kingdom
could
ever
hold
together
in
england
the
historical
party
predicted
the
dismemberment
of
the
united
states
and
in
some
other
countries
it
has
been
a
favorite
article
of
faith
that
england
could
not
keep
her
possessions
but
theories
of
this
kind
are
always
of
very
doubtful
applicability
to
the
present
and
their
applicability
to
the
future
is
even
more
doubtful
still
steam
and
electricity
have
made
great
modern
states
practically
like
so
many
great
cities
so
that
manchester
is
like
a
suburb
of
london
and
havre
the
piræus
of
paris
whilst
the
most
trifling
occasions
bring
the
sovereign
of
italy
to
any
of
the
italian
capitals
in
the
intellectual
sphere
the
experience
of
the
past
is
at
least
equally
unreliable
if
the
power
of
the
catholic
church
had
been
suddenly
removed
from
the
europe
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
consequence
would
have
been
a
moral
anarchy
difficult
to
conceive
but
in
our
own
day
the
real
regulator
of
morality
is
not
the
church
but
public
opinion
in
the
formation
of
which
the
church
has
a
share
but
only
a
share
it
would
therefore
be
unsafe
to
conclude
that
the
weakening
of
ecclesiastical
authority
must
of
necessity
in
the
future
be
followed
by
moral
anarchy
since
it
is
possible
and
even
probable
that
the
other
great
influences
upon
public
opinion
may
gain
strength
as
this
declines
and
in
point
of
fact
we
have
already
lived
long
enough
to
witness
a
remarkable
decline
of
ecclesiastical
authority
which
is
proved
by
the
avowed
independence
of
scientific
writers
and
thinkers
and
by
the
open
opposition
of
almost
all
the
european
governments
the
secular
power
resists
the
ecclesiastical
in
germany
and
spain
in
france
it
establishes
a
form
of
government
which
the
church
detests
in
ireland
it
disestablishes
and
disendows
a
hierarchy
in
switzerland
it
resists
the
whole
power
of
the
papacy
in
italy
it
seizes
the
sacred
territory
and
plants
itself
within
the
very
walls
of
rome
and
yet
the
time
which
has
witnessed
this
unprecedented
of
the
laity
has
witnessed
a
positive
increase
in
the
morality
of
public
sentiment
especially
in
the
love
of
justice
and
the
willingness
to
hear
truth
even
when
truth
is
not
altogether
agreeable
to
the
listener
and
in
the
respect
paid
by
opponents
to
able
and
sincere
men
merely
for
their
ability
and
sincerity
this
love
of
justice
this
patient
and
tolerant
hearing
of
new
truth
in
which
our
age
immeasurably
exceeds
all
the
ages
that
have
preceded
it
are
the
direct
results
of
the
scientific
spirit
and
are
not
only
in
themselves
eminently
moral
but
conducive
to
moral
health
generally
and
this
advancement
may
be
observed
in
countries
which
were
least
supposed
to
be
capable
of
it
even
the
french
of
whose
immorality
we
have
heard
so
much
have
a
public
opinion
which
is
gradually
gaining
a
salutary
strength
an
increasing
dislike
for
barbarity
and
injustice
and
a
more
earnest
desire
that
no
citizen
except
by
his
own
fault
should
be
excluded
from
the
benefits
of
civilization
the
throne
which
has
lately
fallen
was
undermined
by
the
currents
of
this
public
opinion
before
it
sank
in
military
disaster

quite
compatible

gratitude
to
all
who
in
the
past
have
rendered
such
improvement
possible
for
us
and
the
higher
improvement
that
we
hope
for
possible
to
those
who
will
come
after
us
i
can
not
think
that
the
present
age
may
be
accused
with
justice
of
exceptional
ignorance
or
scorn
of
its
predecessors
we
have
been
told
that
we
scorn
our
forefathers
because
old
buildings
are
removed
to
suit
modern
conveniences
because
the
walls
of
old
york
have
been
pierced
for
the
railway
and
a
tower
of
conway
castle
has
been
undermined
that
the
holyhead
mail
may
pass
but
the
truth
is
that
whilst
we
care
a
little
for
our
predecessors
they
cared
still
less
for
theirs
the
mediæval
builders
not
only
used
as
quarries
any
roman
remains
that
happened
to
come
in
their
way
but
they
spoiled
the
work
of
their
own
fathers
and
grandfathers
by
intruding
their
new
fashions
on
buildings
originally
designed
in
a
different
style
of
art
when
an
architect
in
the
present
day
has
to
restore
some
venerable
church
he
endeavors
to
do
so
in
harmony
with
the
design
of
the
first
builder
but
such
humility
as
this
was
utterly
foreign
to
the
mediæval
mind
which
often
destroyed
the
most
lovely
and
necessary
details
to
replace
them
with
erections
in
the
fashion
of
the
day
but
artistically
unsuitable
the
same
disdain
for
the
labors
of
other
ages
has
prevailed
until
within
the
memory
of
living
men
and
our
age
is
really
the
first
that
has
made
any
attempt
to
conform
itself
in
these
things
to
the
intentions
of
the
dead
i
may
also
observe
that
although
history
is
less
relied
upon
as
a
guide
to
the
future
than
it
was
formerly
it
is
more
carefully
and
thoroughly
investigated
from
an
intellectual
interest
in
itself
to
conclude
it
seems
to
me
that
tradition
has
much
less
influence
of
an
authoritative
kind
than
it
had
formerly
and
that
the
authority
which
it
still
possesses
is
everywhere
steadily
declining
that
as
a
guide
to
the
future
of
the
world
it
is
more
likely
to
mislead
than
to
enlighten
us
and
still
that
all
intellectual
and
educated
people
must
always
take
a
great
interest
in
tradition
and
have
a
certain
sentiment
of
respect
for
it
consider
what
our
feelings
are
towards
the
church
of
rome
the
living
embodiment
of
tradition
no
person
can
forget
the
immense
services
that
in
former
ages
she
has
rendered
to
european
civilization
and
yet
at
the
same
time
such
a
person
would
scarcely
wish
to
place
modern
thought
under
her
direction
nor
would
he
consult
the
pope
about
the
tendencies
of
the
modern
world
when
in
the
city
of
warsaw
erected
a
monument
to
copernicus
a
scientific
society
there
waited
in
the
church
of
the
holy
cross
for
a
service
that
was
to
have
added
solemnity
to
their
commemoration
they
waited
vainly
not
a
single
priest
appeared
the
clergy
did
not
feel
authorized
to
countenance
a
scientific
discovery
which
in
a
former
age
had
been
condemned
by
the
authority
of
the
church
this
incident
is
delicately
and
accurately
typical
of
the
relation
between
the
modern
and
the
traditional
spirit
the
modern
spirit
is
not
hostile
to
tradition
and
would
not
object
to
receive
any
consecration
which
tradition
might
be
able
to
confer
but
there
are
difficulties
in
bringing
the
two
elements
together
we
need
not
however
go
so
far
as
warsaw
or
back
to
the
year
for
examples
of
an
unwillingness
on
the
part
of
the
modern
mind
to
break
entirely
with
the
traditional
spirit
our
own
country
is
remarkable
both
for
the
steadiness
of
its
advance
towards
a
future
widely
different
from
the
past
and
for
an
affectionate
respect
for
the
ideas
and
institutions
that
it
gradually
abandons
as
it
is
forced
out
of
them
by
new
conditions
of
existence
i
may
mention
as
one
example
out
of
very
many
our
feeling
about
the
reconstruction
of
the
navy
here
is
a
matter
in
which
science
has
compelled
us
to
break
with
tradition
absolutely
and
irrevocably
we
have
done
so
but
we
have
done
so
with
the
greatest
regret
the
ships
of
the
line
that
our
hearts
and
imaginations
love
are
the
ships
of
nelson
and
collingwood
and
cochrane
we
think
of
the
british
fleets
that
bore
down
upon
the
enemy
with
the
breeze
in
their
white
sails
we
think
of
the
fine
qualities
of
seamanship
that
were
fostered
in
our
and
and
will
the
navies
of
the
future
ever
so
clothe
their
dreadful
powers
with
beauty
as
did
the
ordered
columns
of
nelson
when
they
came
with
a
fair
wind
and
all
sails
set
at
eleven
in
the
morning
into
trafalgar
bay
we
see
the
smoke
of
their
broadsides
rising
up
to
their
sails
like
mists
to
the
snowy
alps
and
high
above
against
heaven
blue
the
unconquered
flag
of
england
nor
do
we
perceive
now
for
the
first
time
that
there
was
poetry
in
those
fleets
of
old
our
forefathers
felt
it
then
and
expressed
it
in
a
thousand
songs

letter
from
lady
westmorland
about
her
son
julian
fane
the
difference
which
you
describe
as
having
arisen
between
your
son
and
you
on
the
most
grave
and
important
subject
which
can
occupy
the
thoughts
of
men
gives
the
outline
of
a
situation
painful
to
both
the
parties
concerned
and
which
lays
on
each
of
them
new
and
delicate
obligations
you
do
not
know
how
common
this
situation
is
and
how
sadly
it
interferes
with
the
happiness
of
the
very
best
and
most
souls
alive
for
such
a
situation
produces
pain
only
where
both
parties
are
earnest
and
sincere
and
the
more
earnest
both
are
the
more
painful
does
the
situation
become
if
you
and
your
son
thought
of
religion
merely
from
the
conventional
point
of
view
as
the
world
does
only
too
easily
you
would
meet
on
a
common
ground
and
might
pass
through
life
without
ever
becoming
aware
of
any
gulf
of
separation
even
though
the
hollowness
of
your
several
professions
were
of
widely
different
kinds
but
as
it
happens
unfortunately
for
your
peace
yet
would
you
have
it
otherwise
that
you
are
both
in
earnest
both
anxious
to
believe
what
is
true
and
do
what
you
believe
to
be
right
you
are
likely
to
cause
each
other
much
suffering
of
a
kind
altogether
unknown
to
less
honorable
and
devoted
natures
there
are
certain
forms
of
suffering
which
affect
only
the
tenderest
and
truest
hearts
they
have
so
many
privileges
that
this
pain
has
been
imposed
upon
them
as
the
shadow
of
their
sunshine
let
me
suggest
as
some
ground
of
consolation
and
of
hope
that
your
very
knowledge
of
the
difference
which
pains
you
is
in
itself
the
evidence
of
a
deeper
unity
if
your
son
has
told
you
the
full
truth
about
the
changes
in
his
belief
it
is
probably
because
you
yourself
have
educated
him
in
the
habit
of
truthfulness
which
is
as
much
a
law
of
religion
as
it
is
of
honor
do
you
wish
this
part
of
his
education
to
be
enfeebled
or
obliterated
could
the
church
herself
reasonably
or
consistently
blame
him
for
practising
the
one
virtue
which
in
a
peaceful
and
luxurious
society
demands
a
certain
exercise
of
courage
our
beliefs
are
independent
of
our
will
but
our
honesty
is
not
and
he
who
keeps
his
honesty
keeps
one
of
the
most
precious
possessions
of
all
true
christians
and
gentlemen
what
state
of
society
can
be
more
repugnant
to
high
religious
feeling
than
a
state
of
smooth
external
unanimity
combined
with
the
indifference
of
the
heart
a
state
in
which
some
splendid
official
religion
performs
its
daily
ceremonies
as
the
costliest
functionary
of
the
government
whilst
the
men
of
culture
take
a
share
in
them
out
of
conformity
to
the
customs
of
society
without
either
the
assent
of
the
intellect
or
the
emotion
of
the
soul
all
periods
of
great
religious
vitality
have
been
marked
by
great
and
open
diversity
of
belief
and
to
this
day
those
countries
where
religion
is
most
alive
are
the
farthest
removed
from
unanimity
in
the
details
of
religious
doctrine
if
your
son
thinks
these
things
of
such
importance
to
his
conscience
that
he
feels
compelled
to
inflict
upon
you
the
slightest
pain
on
their
account
you
may
rest
assured
that
his
religious
fibre
is
still
full
of
vitality
if
it
were
deadened
he
would
argue
very
much
as
follows
he
would
say
these
old
doctrines
of
the
church
are
not
of
sufficient
consequence
for
me
to
disturb
my
mother
about
them
what
is
the
use
of
alluding
to
them
ever
and
then
you
would
have
no
anxiety
and
he
himself
would
have
the
feeling
of
settled
peace
which
comes
over
a
when
the
dead
are
buried
out
of
sight
it
is
the
peculiarity
some
would
say
the
evil
but
i
can
not
think
it
an
evil
of
an
age
of
great
intellectual
activity
to
produce
an
amount
of
critical
inquiry
into
religious
doctrine
which
is
entirely
unknown
to
times
of
simple
tradition
and
in
these
days
the
critical
tendency
has
received
a
novel
stimulus
from
the
successive
suggestions
of
scientific
discovery
no
one
who
like
your
son
fully
shares
in
the
intellectual
life
of
the
times
in
which
he
lives
can
live
as
if
this
criticism
did
not
exist
if
he
affected
to
ignore
it
as
an
objection
already
answered
there
would
be
disingenuousness
in
the
affectation
fifty
years
ago
even
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
a
highly
intellectual
young
man
might
have
hardened
into
the
fixed
convictions
of
middle
age
without
any
external
disturbance
except
such
as
might
have
been
easily
avoided
the
criticism
existed
then
in
certain
circles
but
it
was
not
in
the
air
as
it
is
now
the
life
of
mankind
resembles
that
of
a
brook
which
has
its
times
of
tranquillity
but
farther
on
its
times
of
trouble
and
unrest
our
immediate
forefathers
had
the
peaceful
time
for
their
lot
those
who
went
before
them
had
passed
over
very
rough
ground
at
the
reformation
for
us
in
our
turn
comes
the
recurrent
restlessness
though
not
in
the
same
place
what
we
are
going
to
who
can
tell
what
we
suffer
just
now
you
and
many
others
know
too
accurately
there
are
gulfs
of
separation
in
homes
of
the
most
perfect
love
our
only
hope
of
preserving
what
is
best
in
that
purest
of
earthly
felicities
lies
in
the
practice
of
an
immense
charity
a
wide
tolerance
a
sincere
respect
for
opinions
that
are
not
ours
and
a
deep
trust
that
the
loyal
pursuit
of
truth
can
not
but
be
in
perfect
accordance
with
the
intentions
of
the
creator
who
endowed
the
noblest
races
of
mankind
with
the
indefatigable
curiosity
of
science
not
to
inquire
was
possible
for
our
forefathers
but
it
is
not
possible
for
us
with
our
intellectual
growth
has
come
an
irrepressible
anxiety
to
possess
the
highest
truth
attainable
by
us
this
desire
is
not
sinful
not
presumptuous
but
really
one
of
the
best
and
purest
of
our
instincts
being
nothing
else
than
the
sterling
honesty
of
the
intellect
seeking
the
harmony
of
concordant
truth
and
utterly
disinterested
i
may
quote
as
an
illustration
of
the
tendencies
prevalent
amongst
the
noblest
and
most
cultivated
young
men
a
letter
from
lady
westmorland
to
robert
lytton
about
her
accomplished
son
the
now
celebrated
julian
fane
we
had
she
said
several
conversations
during
his
last
illness
upon
religious
subjects
about
which
he
had
his
own
peculiar
views
the
disputes
and
animosities
between
high
and
low
church
and
all
the
feuds
of
religious
sectarianism
caused
him
the
deepest
disgust
i
think
indeed
that
he
carried
this
feeling
too
far
he
had
a
horror
of
which
i
also
think
was
exaggerated
for
it
gave
him
a
repulsion
for
all
outward
show
of
religious
observances
he
often
told
me
that
he
never
missed
the
practice
of
prayer
at
morning
and
evening
and
at
other
times
but
his
prayers
were
his
own
his
own
thoughts
in
his
own
words
he
said
that
he
could
not
pray
in
the
set
words
of
another
nor
unless
he
was
as
to
joining
in
family
prayers
or
praying
at
church
he
found
it
impossible
he
constantly
read
the
new
testament
he
deprecated
the
indiscriminate
reading
of
the
bible
he
firmly
believed
in
the
efficacy
of
sincere
prayer
and
was
always
pleased
when
i
told
him
i
had
prayed
for
him
to
this
it
may
be
added
that
many
recent
conversions
to
the
church
of
rome
though
apparently
of
an
exactly
opposite
character
have
in
reality
also
been
brought
about
by
the
scientific
inquiries
of
the
age
the
religious
sentiment
alarmed
at
the
prospect
of
a
possible
taking
away
of
that
which
it
feeds
upon
has
sought
in
many
instances
to
preserve
it
permanently
under
the
guardianship
of
the
strongest
ecclesiastical
authority
in
an
age
of
less
intellectual
disturbance
this
anxiety
would
scarcely
have
been
felt
and
the
degree
of
authority
claimed
by
one
of
the
reformed
churches
would
have
been
accepted
as
sufficient
here
again
the
agitations
of
the
modern
intellect
have
caused
division
in
families
and
as
you
are
lamenting
the
heterodoxy
of
your
son
so
other
parents
regret
the
roman
orthodoxy
of
theirs
letter
iv
to
the
son
of
the
lady
to
whom
the
preceding
letter
was
addressed
difficulty
of
detaching
intellectual
from
religious
questions
the
sacerdotal
system
necessary
to
ascertain
what
religion
is
intellectual
religion
really
nothing
but
philosophy
the
popular
instinct
the
test
of
belief
public
worship
the
intellect
moral
but
not
religious
intellectual
activity
sometimes
in
contradiction
to
dogma
differences
between
the
intellectual
and
religious
lives
your
request
is
not
so
simple
as
it
appears
you
ask
me
for
a
frank
opinion
as
to
the
course
your
mind
is
taking
in
reference
to
very
important
subjects
but
you
desire
only
intellectual
and
not
religious
guidance
the
difficulty
is
to
effect
any
clear
demarcation
between
the
two
certainly
i
should
never
take
upon
myself
to
offer
religious
advice
to
any
one
it
is
difficult
for
those
who
have
not
qualified
themselves
for
the
priestly
office
to
do
that
with
force
and
effect
the
manner
in
which
a
priest
leads
and
manages
a
mind
that
has
from
the
first
been
moulded
in
the
beliefs
and
observances
of
his
church
can
not
be
imitated
by
a
layman
a
priest
starts
always
from
authority
his
method
which
has
been
in
use
from
the
earliest
ages
consists
first
in
claiming
your
unquestioning
assent
to
certain
doctrines
from
which
he
immediately
proceeds
to
deduce
the
inferences
that
may
affect
your
conduct
or
regulate
your
thoughts
it
is
a
method
perfectly
adapted
to
its
own
ends
it
can
deal
with
all
humanity
and
produce
the
most
immediate
practical
results
so
long
as
the
assent
to
the
doctrines
is
sincere
the
sacerdotal
system
may
contend
successfully
against
some
of
the
strongest
forms
of
evil
but
when
the
assent
to
the
doctrines
has
ceased
to
be
complete
when
some
of
them
are
and
others
not
believed
at
all
the
system
loses
much
of
its
primitive
efficiency
it
seems
likely
that
your
difficulty
the
difficulty
of
so
many
intellectual
men
in
these
days
is
to
know
where
the
intellectual
questions
end
and
the
purely
religious
ones
can
be
considered
to
begin
if
you
could
once
ascertain
that
in
a
manner
definitely
satisfactory
you
would
take
your
religious
questions
to
a
clergyman
and
your
intellectual
ones
to
a
man
of
science
and
so
get
each
solved
independently
without
presuming
to
offer
a
solution
of
so
complex
a
difficulty
as
this
i
may
suggest
to
you
that
it
is
of
some
importance
to
your
intellectual
life
to
ascertain
what
religion
is
a
book
was
published
many
years
ago
by
a
very
learned
author
in
which
he
endeavored
to
show
that
what
is
vulgarly
called
scepticism
may
be
intellectual
religion
now
although
nothing
can
be
more
distasteful
to
persons
of
culture
than
the
bigotry
which
refuses
the
name
of
religion
to
other
opinions
merely
because
they
are
other
people
opinions
i
suspect
that
the
popular
instinct
is
right
in
denying
the
name
of
religion
to
the
inferences
of
the
intellect
the
description
which
the
author
just
alluded
to
gave
of
what
he
called
intellectual
religion
was
in
fact
simply
a
description
of
philosophy
and
of
that
discipline
which
the
best
philosophy
imposes
upon
the
heart
and
the
passions
on
the
other
hand
arnold
when
he
says
that
by
religion
he
always
understands
christianity
narrows
the
word
as
much
as
he
would
have
narrowed
the
word
patriotism
had
he
defined
it
to
mean
a
devotion
to
the
interests
of
england
i
think
the
popular
instinct
though
of
course
quite
unable
to
construct
a
definition
of
religion
is
in
its
vague
way
very
well
aware
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
religious
thought
and
feeling
the
popular
instinct
would
certainly
never
confound
religion
with
philosophy
on
the
one
hand
nor
on
the
other
unless
excited
to
opposition
would
it
be
likely
to
refuse
the
name
of
religion
to
another
worship
such
as
mahometanism
for
instance
according
to
the
popular
instinct
then
which
on
a
subject
of
this
kind
appears
the
safest
of
all
guides
a
religion
involves
first
a
belief
and
next
a
public
practice
the
nature
of
the
belief
is
in
these
days
wholly
peculiar
to
religion
in
other
times
it
was
not
so
because
then
people
believed
other
things
much
in
the
same
way
but
in
these
days
the
test
of
religious
belief
is
that
it
should
make
men
accept
as
certain
truth
what
they
would
disbelieve
on
any
other
authority
for
example
a
true
roman
catholic
believes
that
the
consecrated
host
is
the
body
of
christ
and
so
long
as
he
lives
in
the
purely
religious
spirit
he
continues
to
believe
this
but
so
soon
as
the
power
of
his
religious
sentiment
declines
he
ceases
to
believe
it
and
the
wafer
appears
to
him
a
wafer
and
no
more
and
so
amongst
protestants
the
truly
religious
believe
many
things
which
no
person
not
being
under
the
authority
of
religion
could
by
any
effort
bring
himself
to
believe
it
is
easy
for
example
to
believe
that
joshua
arrested
the
sun
apparent
motion
so
long
as
the
religious
authority
of
the
bible
remains
perfectly
intact
but
no
sooner
does
the
reader
become
critical
than
the
miracle
is
disbelieved
in
all
ages
and
in
all
countries
religions
have
narrated
marvellous
things
and
the
people
have
always
affirmed
that
not
to
believe
these
narratives
constituted
the
absence
of
religion
or
what
they
called
atheism
they
have
equally
in
all
ages
and
countries
held
the
public
act
of
participation
in
religious
worship
to
be
an
essential
part
of
what
they
called
religion
they
do
not
admit
the
sufficiency
of
secret
prayer
can
these
popular
instincts
help
us
to
a
definition
they
may
help
us
at
least
to
mark
the
dividing
line
between
religion
and
morality
between
religion
and
philosophy
no
one
has
ever
desired
more
earnestly
and
eagerly
than
i
to
discover
the
foundations
of
the
intellectual
religion
no
one
has
ever
felt
more
chilling
disappointment
in
the
perception
of
the
plain
bare
fact
that
the
intellect
gives
morality
philosophy
precious
things
indeed
but
not
religion
it
is
like
seeking
art
by
science
thousands
of
artists
whole
schools
from
generation
to
generation
have
sought
fine
art
through
anatomy
and
perspective
and
although
these
sciences
did
not
hinder
the
born
artists
from
coming
to
art
at
last
they
did
not
ensure
their
safe
arrival
in
the
in
many
instances
they
even
led
men
away
from
art
so
it
is
with
the
great
modern
search
for
the
intellectual
religion
the
idea
of
it
is
scientific
in
its
source
and
the
result
of
it
the
last
definite
attainment
is
simply
intellectual
morality
not
religion
in
the
sense
which
all
humanity
has
attached
to
religion
during
all
the
ages
that
have
preceded
ours
we
may
say
that
philosophy
is
the
religion
of
the
intellectual
and
if
we
go
scrupulously
to
latin
derivations
it
is
so
but
taking
frankly
the
received
meaning
of
the
word
as
it
is
used
by
mankind
everywhere
we
must
admit
that
although
high
intellect
would
lead
us
inevitably
to
high
and
pure
morality
and
to
most
scrupulously
beautiful
conduct
in
everything
towards
men
towards
women
towards
even
the
lower
and
lowest
animals
still
it
does
not
lead
us
to
that
belief
in
the
otherwise
unbelievable
or
to
that
detailed
which
is
meant
by
religion
in
the
universally
accepted
sense
it
is
disingenuous
to
take
a
word
popularly
respected
and
attribute
to
it
another
sense
such
a
course
is
not
strictly
honest
and
therefore
not
purely
intellectual
for
the
foundation
of
the
intellectual
life
is
honesty
the
difficulty
of
the
intellectual
life
is
that
whilst
it
can
never
assume
a
position
of
hostility
to
religion
which
it
must
always
recognize
as
the
greatest
natural
force
for
the
amelioration
of
mankind
it
is
nevertheless
compelled
to
enunciate
truths
which
may
happen
to
be
in
contradiction
with
dogmas
received
at
this
or
that
particular
time
that
you
may
not
suspect
me
of
a
disposition
to
dwell
continually
on
safe
generalities
and
to
avoid
details
out
of
timidity
let
me
mention
two
cases
on
which
the
intellectual
and
scientific
find
themselves
at
variance
with
the
clergy
the
clergy
tell
us
that
mankind
descend
from
a
single
pair
and
that
in
the
earlier
ages
the
human
race
attained
a
longevity
counted
not
by
decades
but
by
centuries
alexander
humboldt
disbelieves
the
first
of
these
propositions
professor
owen
disbelieves
the
second
men
of
science
generally
are
of
the
same
opinion
few
men
of
science
accept
adam
and
eve
few
accept
methuselah
professor
owen
argues
that
since
the
oldest
skeletons
known
have
the
same
system
of
teething
that
we
have
man
can
never
have
lived
long
enough
to
require
nine
sets
of
teeth
in
regard
to
these
and
a
hundred
other
points
on
which
science
advances
new
views
the
question
which
concerns
us
is
how
we
are
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
intellectual
life
the
danger
is
the
loss
of
inward
ingenuousness
the
attempt
to
persuade
ourselves
that
we
believe
opposite
statements
if
once
we
admit
disingenuousness
into
the
mind
the
intellectual
life
is
no
longer
serene
and
pure
the
plain
course
for
the
preservation
of
our
honesty
which
is
the
basis
of
truly
intellectual
thinking
is
to
receive
the
truth
whether
agreeable
or
the
contrary
with
all
its
train
of
consequences
however
repulsive
or
discouraging
in
attempting
to
reconcile
scientific
truth
with
the
oldest
traditions
of
humanity
there
is
but
one
serious
danger
the
loss
of
intellectual
integrity
of
that
possession
modern
society
has
little
left
to
lose
but
let
us
understand
that
the
intellectual
life
and
the
religious
life
are
as
distinct
as
the
scientific
and
the
artistic
lives
they
may
be
led
by
the
same
person
but
by
the
same
person
in
different
moods
they
coincide
on
some
points
accidentally
certainly
the
basis
of
high
thinking
is
perfect
honesty
and
honesty
is
a
recognized
religious
virtue
where
the
two
minds
differ
is
on
the
importance
of
authority
the
religious
life
is
based
upon
authority
the
intellectual
life
is
based
upon
personal
investigation
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
i
can
not
advise
you
to
restrain
the
spirit
of
investigation
which
is
the
scientific
spirit
it
may
lead
you
very
far
yet
always
to
truth
ultimately
you
or
those
after
you
whose
path
you
may
be
destined
to
prepare
science
requires
a
certain
inward
heat
and
heroism
in
her
votaries
notwithstanding
the
apparent
coldness
of
her
statements
especially
does
she
require
that
intellectual
fearlessness
which
accepts
a
proved
fact
without
reference
to
its
personal
or
its
social
consequences
letter
to
a
friend
who
seemed
to
take
credit
to
himself
intellectually
from
the
nature
of
his
religious
belief
anecdote
of
a
swiss
gentleman
religious
belief
protects
traditions
but
does
not
weaken
the
critical
faculty
itself
illustration
from
the
art
of
etching

smith
arnold
earnest
religious
belief
of
ampère
comte
and
faraday
belief
or
unbelief
proves
nothing
for
or
against
intellectual
capacity
i
happened
once
to
be
travelling
in
switzerland
with
an
eminent
citizen
of
that
country
and
i
remember
how
in
speaking
of
some
place
we
passed
through
he
associated
together
the
ideas
of
protestantism
and
intellectual
superiority
in
some
such
phrase
as
this
the
people
here
are
very
superior
they
are
protestants
there
seemed
to
exist
in
my
companion
mind
an
assumption
that
protestants
would
be
superior
people
intellectually
or
that
superior
people
would
be
protestants
and
this
set
me
thinking
whether
in
the
course
of
such
experience
as
had
fallen
in
my
way
i
had
found
that
religious
creed
had
made
much
difference
in
the
matter
of
intellectual
acumen
or
culture
the
exact
truth
appears
to
be
this
a
religious
belief
protects
this
or
that
subject
against
intellectual
action
but
it
does
not
affect
the
energy
of
the
intellectual
action
upon
subjects
which
are
not
so
protected
let
me
illustrate
this
by
a
reference
to
one
of
the
fine
arts
the
art
of
etching
the
etcher
protects
a
by
means
of
a
waxy
covering
called
and
wherever
this
ground
is
removed
the
acid
bites
the
copper
the
waxy
ground
does
not
in
the
least
affect
the
strength
of
the
acid
it
only
intervenes
between
it
and
the
metal
plate
so
it
is
in
the
mind
of
man
with
regard
to
his
intellectual
acumen
and
his
religious
creed
the
creed
may
protect
a
tradition
from
the
operation
of
the
critical
faculty
but
it
does
not
weaken
the
critical
faculty
itself
in
the
english
church
for
example
the
bible
is
protected
against
criticism
but
this
does
not
weaken
the
critical
faculty
of
english
clergymen
with
reference
to
other
literature
and
many
of
them
give
evidence
of
a
strong
critical
faculty
in
all
matters
not
protected
by
their
creed
think
of
the
vigorous
common
sense
of
sydney
smith
exposing
so
many
abuses
at
a
time
when
it
needed
not
only
much
courage
but
great
originality
to
expose
them
remember
the
intellectual
force
of
arnold
a
great
natural
force
if
ever
there
was
one
so
direct
in
action
so
independent
of
contemporary
opinion
intellectual
forces
of
this
kind
act
freely
not
only
in
the
church
of
england
but
in
other
churches
even
in
the
church
of
rome
who
amongst
the
scientific
men
of
this
century
has
been
more
profoundly
scientific
more
capable
of
original
scientific
discovery
than
ampère
yet
ampère
was
a
roman
catholic
and
not
a
roman
catholic
in
the
conventional
sense
merely
like
the
majority
of
educated
frenchmen
but
a
hearty
and
enthusiastic
believer
in
the
doctrines
of
the
church
of
rome
the
belief
in
transubstantiation
did
not
prevent
ampère
from
becoming
one
of
the
best
chemists
of
his
time
just
as
the
belief
in
the
plenary
inspiration
of
the
new
testament
does
not
prevent
a
good
protestant
from
becoming
an
acute
critic
of
greek
literature
generally
a
man
may
have
the
finest
scientific
faculty
the
most
advanced
scientific
culture
and
still
believe
the
consecrated
wafer
to
the
body
of
jesus
christ
for
since
he
still
believes
it
to
be
the
body
of
christ
under
the
apparent
form
of
a
wafer
it
is
evident
that
the
wafer
under
chemical
analysis
would
resolve
itself
into
the
same
elements
as
before
consecration
therefore
why
consult
chemistry
what
has
chemistry
to
say
to
a
mystery
of
this
kind
the
essence
of
which
is
the
disguise
of
a
human
body
under
a
form
in
respects
answering
the
material
semblance
of
a
wafer
ampère
must
have
foreseen
the
certain
results
of
analysis
as
clearly
as
the
best
chemist
educated
in
the
principles
of
protestantism
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
adoring
the
consecrated
host
in
all
the
sincerity
of
his
heart
i
say
that
it
does
not
follow
because
or
happens
to
be
a
protestant
that
he
is
intellectually
superior
to
ampère
or
because
or
happens
to
be
a
unitarian
or
a
deist
or
a
positivist
that
he
is
intellectually
superior
to
arnold
or
sydney
smith
and
on
the
other
side
of
this
question
it
is
equally
unfair
to
conclude
that
because
a
man
does
not
share
whatever
may
be
our
theological
beliefs
on
the
positive
side
he
must
be
less
capable
intellectually
than
we
are
two
of
the
finest
and
most
disciplined
modern
intellects
comte
and
were
neither
catholics
nor
protestants
nor
deists
but
convinced
atheists
yet
comte
until
the
period
of
his
decline
and
up
to
the
very
hour
of
his
death
were
quite
in
the
highest
rank
of
modern
scientific
and
literary
intellect
the
inference
from
these
facts
which
concerns
every
one
of
us
is
that
we
are
not
to
build
up
any
edifice
of
intellectual
on
the
ground
that
in
theological
matters
we
believe
or
disbelieve
this
thing
or
that
if
ampère
believed
the
doctrines
of
the
church
of
rome
which
to
us
seem
so
incredible
if
faraday
remained
throughout
his
brilliant
intellectual
career
certainly
one
of
the
most
brilliant
ever
lived
through
by
a
human
being
a
sincere
member
of
the
obscure
sect
of
the
sandemanians
we
are
not
warranted
in
the
conclusion
that
we
are
intellectually
their
betters
because
our
theology
is
more
novel
or
more
fashionable
or
more
in
harmony
with
reason
nor
on
the
other
hand
does
our
orthodoxy
prove
anything
in
favor
of
our
mental
force
and
culture
who
amongst
the
most
orthodox
writers
has
a
more
forcible
and
cultivated
intellect
than
who
can
better
give
us
the
tone
of
perfect
culture
with
its
love
of
justice
its
thoroughness
in
preparation
its
superiority
to
all
crudeness
and
violence
anglican
or
romanist
dissenter
or
heretic
may
be
our
master
in
the
intellectual
sphere
from
which
no
sincere
and
capable
laborer
is
excluded

by
his
belief
or
by
his
unbelief
letter
vi
to
a
roman
catholic
friend
who
accused
the
intellectual
class
of
a
want
of
reverence
for
authority
necessity
for
treating
affirmations
as
if
they
were
doubtful
the
papal
infallibility
the
infallibility
of
the
sacred
scriptures
opposition
of
method
between
intellect
and
faith
the
perfection
of
the
intellectual
life
requires
intellectual
methods
inevitable
action
of
the
intellectual
forces
it
is
very
much
the
custom
in
modern
writing
about
liberty
of
thought
to
pass
lightly
over
the
central
difficulty
which
sooner
or
later
will
have
to
be
considered
the
difficulty
is
this
that
the
freedom
of
the
intellectual
life
can
never
be
secured
except
by
treating
as
if
they
were
doubtful
several
affirmations
which
large
masses
of
mankind
hold
to
be
certainties
as
indisputable
as
the
facts
of
science
one
of
the
most
recently
conspicuous
of
these
affirmations
is
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
of
rome
nothing
can
be
more
certain
in
the
opinion
of
immense
numbers
of
roman
catholics
than
the
infallible
authority
of
the
supreme
pontiff
on
all
matters
affecting
doctrine
but
then
the
matters
affecting
doctrine
include
many
subjects
which
come
within
the
circle
of
the
sciences
history
is
one
of
those
subjects
which
modern
intellectual
criticism
takes
leave
to
study
after
its
own
methods
and
yet
certain
prevalent
views
of
history
are
offensive
to
the
pope
and
explicitly
condemned
by
him
the
consequence
is
that
in
order
to
study
history
with
mental
liberty
we
have
to
act
practically
as
if
there
existed
a
doubt
of
the
papal
infallibility
the
same
difficulty
occurs
with
reference
to
the
great
protestant
doctrine
which
attributes
a
similar
infallibility
to
the
various
authors
who
composed
what
are
now
known
to
us
as
the
holy
scriptures
our
men
of
science
act
and
the
laws
of
scientific
investigation
compel
them
to
act
as
if
it
were
not
quite
certain
that
the
views
of
scientific
subjects
held
by
those
early
writers
were
so
final
as
to
render
modern
investigation
superfluous
it
is
useless
to
disguise
the
fact
that
there
is
a
real
opposition
of
method
between
intellect
and
faith
and
that
the
independence
of
the
intellectual
life
can
never
be
fully
secured
unless
all
affirmations
based
upon
authority
are
treated
as
if
they
were
doubtful
this
implies
no
change
of
manner
in
the
intellectual
classes
towards
those
classes
whose
mental
habits
are
founded
upon
obedience
i
mean
that
the
man
of
science
does
not
treat
the
affirmations
of
any
priesthood
with
less
respect
than
the
affirmations
of
his
own
scientific
brethren
he
applies
with
perfect
impartiality
the
same
criticism
to
all
affirmations
from
whatever
source
they
emanate
the
intellect
does
not
recognize
authority
in
any
one
and
intellectual
men
do
not
treat
the
pope
or
the
author
of
genesis
with
less
consideration
than
those
famous
persons
who
in
their
day
have
been
the
brightest
luminaries
of
science
the
difficulty
however
remains
that
whilst
the
intellectual
class
has
no
wish
to
offend
either
those
who
believe
in
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
or
those
who
believe
in
the
infallibility
of
the
author
of
genesis
it
is
compelled
to
conduct
its
own
investigations
as
if
those
infallibilities
were
matters
of
doubt
and
not
of
certainty
why
this
is
so
may
be
shown
by
a
reference
to
the
operation
of
nature
in
other
ways
the
rewards
of
physical
strength
and
health
are
not
given
to
the
most
moral
to
the
most
humane
to
the
most
gentle
but
to
those
who
have
acted
and
whose
forefathers
have
acted
in
the
most
perfect
accordance
with
the
laws
of
their
physical
constitution
so
the
perfection
of
the
intellectual
life
is
not
given
to
the
most
humble
the
most
believing
the
most
obedient
but
to
those
who
use
their
minds
according
to
the
most
purely
intellectual
methods
one
of
the
most
important
truths
that
human
beings
can
know
is
the
perfectly
independent
working
of
the
natural
laws
one
of
the
best
practical
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
the
observation
of
nature
is
that
in
the
conduct
of
our
own
understandings
we
should
use
a
like
independence
it
would
be
wrong
in
writing
to
you
on
subjects
so
important
as
these
to
shrink
from
handling
the
real
difficulties
every
one
now
is
aware
that
science
must
and
will
pursue
her
own
methods
and
work
according
to
her
own
laws
without
concerning
herself
with
the
most
authoritative
affirmations
from
without
but
if
science
said
one
thing
and
authoritative
tradition
said
another
no
perfectly
ingenuous
person
could
rest
contented
until
he
had
either
reconciled
the
two
or
decidedly
rejected
one
of
them
it
is
impossible
for
a
mind
which
is
honest
towards
itself
to
admit
that
a
proposition
is
true
and
false
at
the
same
time
true
in
science
and
false
in
theology
therefore
although
the
intellectual
methods
are
entirely
independent
of
tradition
it
may
easily
happen
that
the
indirect
results
of
our
following
those
methods
may
be
the
overthrow
of
some
dogma
which
has
for
many
generations
been
considered
indispensable
to
man
spiritual
welfare
with
regard
to
this
contingency
it
need
only
be
observed
that
the
intellectual
forces
of
humanity
must
act
like
floods
and
winds
according
to
their
own
laws
and
that
if
they
cast
down
any
edifice
too
weak
to
resist
them
it
must
be
because
the
original
constructors
had
not
built
it
substantially
or
because
those
placed
in
charge
of
it
had
neglected
to
keep
it
in
repair
this
is
their
business
not
ours
our
work
is
simply
to
ascertain
truth
by
our
own
independent
methods
alike
without
hostility
to
any
persons
claiming
authority
and
without
deference
to
them
footnotes
the
title
of
this
letter
seems
so
odd
that
it
may
be
necessary
to
inform
the
reader
that
it
was
addressed
to
a
real
person
i
had
desired
to
say
something
about
the
uses
of
tradition
in
the
industrial
arts
and
in
the
fine
arts
but
the
subject
is
a
very
large
one
and
i
have
not
time
or
space
to
treat
it
properly
here
i
may
observe
however
briefly
that
the
genuine
spirit
of
tradition
has
almost
entirely
disappeared
from
english
industry
and
art
where
it
has
been
replaced
by
a
spirit
of
scientific
investigation
and
experiment
the
true
traditional
spirit
was
still
in
full
vigor
in
japan
a
few
years
ago
and
it
kept
the
industry
and
art
of
that
country
up
to
a
remarkably
high
standard
the
traditional
spirit
is
most
favorable
to
professional
skill
because
under
its
influence
the
apprentice
learns
thoroughly
whereas
under
other
influences
he
often
learns
very
imperfectly
the
inferiority
of
english
painting
to
french
considered
technically
has
been
due
to
the
prevalence
of
a
traditional
spirit
in
the
french
school
which
was
almost
entirely
absent

our
own
part

difference

difficulty
of

the
subject
of
marriage
is
one
concerning
which
neither
i
nor
anybody
else
can
have
more
than
an
infinitesimally
small
atom
of
knowledge
each
of
us
knows
how
his
or
her
own
marriage
has
turned
out
but
that
in
comparison
with
a
knowledge
of
marriage
generally
is
like
a
single
plant
in
comparison
with
the
flora
of
the
globe
the
utmost
experience
on
this
subject
to
be
found
in
this
country
extends
to
about
three
trials
or
experiments
a
man
may
become
twice
a
widower
and
then
marry
a
third
time
but
it
may
be
easily
shown
that
the
variety
of
his
experience
is
more
than
counterbalanced
by
its
incompleteness
in
each
instance
for
the
experiment
to
be
conclusive
even
as
to
the
wisdom
of
one
decision
it
must
extend
over
half
a
lifetime
a
true
marriage
is
not
a
mere
temporary
arrangement
and
although
a
young
couple
are
said
to
be
married
as
soon
as
the
lady
has
changed
her
name
the
truth
is
that
the
real
marriage
is
a
long
slow
intergrowth
like
that
of
two
trees
planted
quite
close
together
in
the
forest
the
subject
of
marriage
generally
is
one
of
which
men
know
less
than
they
know
of
any
other
subject
of
universal
interest
people
are
almost
always
wrong
in
their
estimates
of
the
marriages
of
others
and
the
best
proof
how
little
we
know
the
real
tastes
and
needs
of
those
with
whom
we
have
been
most
intimate
is
our
unfailing
surprise
at
the
marriages
they
make
very
old
and
experienced
people
fancy
they
know
a
great
deal
about
younger
couples
but
their
guesses
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
never
hit
the
mark
ever
since
this
idea
that
marriage
is
a
subject
we
are
all
very
ignorant
about
had
taken
root
in
my
own
mind
many
little
incidents
were
perpetually
occurring
to
confirm
it
they
proved
to
me
on
the
one
hand
how
often
i
had
been
mistaken
about
other
people
and
on
the
other
hand
how
mistaken
other
people
were
concerning
the
only
marriage
i
profess
to
know
anything
about
namely
my
own
our
ignorance
is
all
the
darker
that
few
men
tell
us
the
little
that
they
know
that
little
being
too
closely
bound
up
with
that
innermost
privacy
of
life
which
every
man
of
right
feeling
respects
in
his
own
case
as
in
the
case
of
another
the
only
instances
which
are
laid
bare
to
the
public
view
are
the
unhappy
marriages
which
are
really
not
marriages
at
all
an
unhappy
alliance
bears
exactly
the
same
relation
to
a
true
marriage
that
disease
does
to
health
and
the
quarrels
and
misery
of
it
are
the
crises
by
which
nature
tries
to
bring
about
either
the
recovery
of
happiness
or
the
endurable
peace
of
a
settled
separation
all
that
we
really
know
about
marriage
is
that
it
is
based
upon
the
most
powerful
of
all
our
instincts
and
that
it
shows
its
own
justification
in
its
fruits
especially
in
the
prolonged
and
watchful
care
of
children
but
marriage
is
very
complex
in
its
effects
and
there
is
one
set
of
effects
resulting
from
it
to
which
remarkably
little
attention
has
been
paid
hitherto
i
mean
its
effects
upon
the
intellectual
life
surely
they
deserve
consideration
by
all
who
value
culture
i
believe
that
for
an
intellectual
man
only
two
courses
are
open
either
he
ought
to
marry
some
simple
dutiful
woman
who
will
bear
him
children
and
see
to
the
household
matters
and
love
him
in
a
trustful
spirit
without
jealousy
of
his
occupations
or
else
on
the
other
hand
he
ought
to
marry
some
highly
intelligent
lady
able
to
carry
her
education
far
beyond
school
experiences
and
willing
to
become
his
companion
in
the
arduous
paths
of
intellectual
labor
the
danger
in
the
first
of
the
two
cases
is
that
pointed
out
by
wordsworth
in
some
verses
addressed
to
who
might
feel
inclined
to
buy
a
cottage
in
westmorland
the
tourist
would
spoil
the
little
romantic
spot
if
he
bought
it
the
charm
of
it
is
subtly
dependent
upon
the
poetry
of
a
simple
life
and
would
be
brushed
away
by
the
influence
of
the
things
that
are
necessary
to
people
in
the
middle
class
i
remember
dining
in
a
country
inn
with
an
english
officer
whose
ideas
were
singularly
unconventional
we
were
waited
upon
by
our
host
daughter
a
beautiful
girl
whose
manners
were
remarkable
for
their
natural
elegance
and
distinction
it
seemed
to
us
both
that
no
lady
of
rank
could
be
more
distinguished
than
she
was
and
my
companion
said
that
he
thought
a
gentleman
might
do
worse
than
ask
that
girl
to
marry
him
and
settle
down
quietly
in
that
quiet
mountain
village
far
from
the
cares
and
vanities
of
the
world
that
is
a
sort
of
dream
which
has
occurred
no
doubt
to
many
an
honorable
man
some
men
have
gone
so
far
as
to
try
to
make
the
dream
a
reality
and
have
married
the
beautiful
peasant
but
the
difficulty
is
that
she
does
not
remain
what
she
was
she
becomes
a
sort
of
lady
and
then
her
ignorance
which
in
her
natural
condition
was
a
charming
becomes
an
irritating
defect
if
however
it
were
possible
for
an
intellectual
man
to
marry
some
peasant
girl
and
keep
her
carefully
in
her
original
condition
i
seriously
believe
that
the
venture
would
be
less
perilous
to
his
culture
than
an
alliance
with
some
woman
of
our
philistine
classes
equally
incapable
of
comprehending
his
pursuits
but
much
more
likely
to
interfere
with
them
i
once
had
a
conversation
on
this
subject
with
a
distinguished
artist
who
is
now
a
widower
and
who
is
certainly
not
likely
to
be
prejudiced
against
marriage
by
his
own
experience
which
had
been
an
unusually
happy
one
his
view
was
that
a
man
devoted
to
art
might
marry
either
a
woman
who
would
occupy
herself
exclusively
with
household
matters
and
shield
his
peace
by
taking
these
cares
upon
herself
or
else
a
woman
quite
capable
of
entering
into
his
artistic
life
but
he
was
convinced
that
a
marriage
which
exposed
him
to
unintelligent
criticism
and
interference
would
be
dangerous
in
the
highest
degree
and
of
the
two
kinds
of
marriage
which
he
considered
possible
he
preferred
the
former
that
with
the
entirely
ignorant
and
simple
person
from
whom
no
interference
was
to
be
apprehended
he
considered
the
first
madame
ingres
the
true
model
of
an
artist
wife
because
she
did
all
in
her
power
to
guard
her
husband
peace
against
the
daily
cares
of
life
and
never
herself
disturbed
it
acting
the
part
of
a
breakwater
which
protects
a
space
of
calm
and
never
destroys
the
peace
that
it
has
made
this
may
be
true
for
artists
whose
occupation
is
rather
æsthetic
than
intellectual
and
does
not
get
much
help
or
benefit
from
talk
but
the
ideal
marriage
for
a
man
of
great
literary
culture
would
be
one
permitting
some
equality
of
companionship
or
if
not
equality
at
least
interest
that
this
ideal
is
not
a
mere
dream
but
may
consolidate
into
a
happy
reality
several
examples
prove
yet
these
examples
are
not
so
numerous
as
to
relieve
me
from
anxiety
about
your
chances
of
finding
such
companionship
the
different
education
of
the
two
sexes
separates
them
widely
at
the
beginning
and
to
meet
on
any
common
ground
of
culture
a
second
education
has
to
be
gone
through
it
rarely
happens
that
there
is
resolution
enough
for
this
the
want
of
thoroughness
and
reality
in
the
education
of
both
sexes
but
especially
in
that
of
women
may
be
attributed
to
a
sort
of
policy
which
is
not
very
favorable
to
companionship
in
married
life
it
appears
to
be
thought
wise
to
teach
boys
things
which
women
do
not
learn
in
order
to
give
women
a
degree
of
respect
for
men
attainments
which
they
would
not
be
so
likely
to
feel
if
they
were
prepared
to
estimate
them
critically
whilst
girls
are
taught
arts
and
languages
which
until
recently
were
all
but
excluded
from
our
public
schools
and
won
no
rank
at
our
universities
men
and
women
had
consequently
scarcely
any
common
ground
to
meet
upon
and
the
absence
of
serious
mental
discipline
in
the
training
of
women
made
them
indisposed
to
submit
to
the
irksomeness
of
that
earnest
intellectual
labor
which
might
have
remedied
the
deficiency
the
total
lack
of
accuracy
in
their
mental
habits
was
then
and
is
still
for
the
immense
majority
of
women
the
least
easily
surmountable
impediment
to
culture
the
history
of
many
marriages
which
have
failed
to
realize
intellectual
companionship
is
comprised
in
a
sentence
which
was
actually
uttered
by
one
of
the
most
accomplished
of
my
friends
she
knew
nothing
when
i
married

i
tried
to
teach
her
something
it
made
her
angry

it
up
letter
ii
to
a
young

who
contemplated
marriage
the
foundations
of
the
intellectual
marriage
marriage
not
a
snare
or
pitfall
for
the
intellectual
men
of
culture
who
marry
badly
often
have
themselves
to
blame
for
every
grade
of
the
masculine
intellect
there
exists
a
corresponding
grade
of
the
feminine
intellect
difficulty

regrets
of
a

women
help
us
less
by
adding
to
our
knowledge
than
by
understanding
us
in
several
letters
which
have
preceded
this
i
have
indicated
some
of
the
differences
between
the
female
sex
and
ours
and
it
is
time
to
examine
the
true
foundations
of
the
intellectual
marriage
let
me
affirm
to
begin
with
my
profound
faith
in
the
natural
arrangement
there
is
in
nature
so
much
evident
care
for
the
development
of
the
intellectual
life
so
much
protection
of
it
in
the
social
order
there
are
such
admirable
contrivances
for
continuing
it
from
century
to
century
that
we
may
fairly
count
upon
some
provision
for
its
necessities
in
marriage
intellectual
men
are
not
less
alive
to
the
charms
of
women
than
other
men
are
indeed
the
greatest
of
them
have
always
delighted
in
the
society
of
women
if
marriage
were
really
dangerous
to
the
intellectual
life
it
would
be
a
moral
snare
or
pitfall
from
which
the
best
and
noblest
would
be
least
likely
to
escape
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
the
strong
passions
which
so
often
accompany
high
intellectual
gifts
were
intended
either
to
drive
their
possessors
into
immorality
or
else
to
the
misery
of
unions
no
there
such
a
thing
as
the
intellectual
marriage
in
which
the
intellect
itself
is
married
if
such
marriages
are
not
frequent
it
is
that
they
are
not
often
made
the
deliberate
purpose
of
a
wise
alliance
men
choose
their
wives
because
they
are
pretty
or
because
they
are
rich
or
because
they
are
but
rarely
for
the
permanent
interest
of
their
society
yet
who
that
had
ever
been
condemned
to
the
dreadful
embarrassments
of
a
with
an
uncompanionable
person
could
reflect
without
apprehension
on
a
lifetime
of
such
when
intellectual
men
suffer
from
this
misery
they
have
themselves
to
blame
what
is
the
use
of
having
any
mental
superiority
if
in
a
matter
so
enormously
important
as
the
choice
of
a
companion
for
life
it
fails
to
give
us
a
warning
when
the
choice
is
absurdly
unsuitable
when
men
complain
as
they
do
not
unfrequently
that
their
wives
have
no
ideas
the
question
inevitably
suggests
itself
why
the
superiority
of
the
masculine
intellect
did
not
in
these
cases
permit
it
to
discover
the
defect
in
time
if
we
are
so
clever
as
to
be
bored
by
ordinary
women
why
can
not
our
cleverness
find
out
the
feminine
cleverness
which
would
respond
to
it
what
i
am
going
to
say
now
is
in
its
very
nature
incapable
of
proof
and
yet
the
longer
i
live
the
more
the
truth
of
it
is
borne
in
upon
me
i
feel
convinced
that
for
every
grade
of
the
masculine
intellect
there
exists
a
corresponding
grade
of
the
feminine
intellect
so
that
a
precisely
suitable
intellectual
marriage
is
always
possible
for
every
one
but
since
the
higher
intellects
are
rare
and
rare
in
proportion
to
their
elevation
it
follows
that
the
difficulty
of
finding
the
true
mate
increases
with
the
mental
strength
and
culture
of
the
man
if
the
mental
princes
as
blake
called
himself
are
to
marry
the
mental
princesses
they
will
not
always
discover
them
quite
so
easily
as
sons
find
kings
daughters
this
difficulty
of
finding
the
true
mate
is
the
real
reason
why
so
many
clever
men
marry
silly
or
stupid
women
the
women
about
them
seem
to
be
all
very
much
alike
mentally
it
seems
hopeless
to
expect
any
real
companionship
and
the
clever
men
are
decided
by
the
color
of
a
eyes
or
a
thousand
pounds
more
in
her
dowry
or
her
relationship
to
a
peer
of
the
realm
it
was
remarked
to
me
by
a
french
university
professor
that
although
men
in
his
position
had
on
the
whole
much
more
culture
than
the
middle
class
they
had
an
extraordinary
talent
for
winning
the
most
vulgar
and
ignorant
wives
the
explanation
is
that
their
marriages
are
not
intellectual
marriages
at
all
the
class
of
french
professors
is
not
advantageously
situated
it
has
not
great
facilities
for
choice
their
incomes
are
so
small
that
unless
helped
by
private
means
the
first
thing
they
can
prudently
look
to
in
a
wife
is
her
utility
as
a
domestic
servant
which
in
fact
it
is
her
destiny
to
become
the
intellectual
disparity
is
from
the
beginning
likely
to
be
very
great
because
the
professor
is
confined
to
the
where
his
happens
to
be
situated
and
in
that
town
he
does
not
always
see
the
most
cultivated
society
he
may
be
an
intellectual
prince
but
where
is
he
to
find
his
princess
the
marriage
begins
without
the
idea
of
intellectual
companionship
and
it
continues
as
it
began
the
girl
was
uneducated
it
seems
hopeless
to
try
to
educate
the
woman
and
then
there
is
the
supreme
difficulty
only
to
be
overcome
by
two
wills
at
once
most
resolute
and
most
persistent
namely
how
to
find
the
time
years
pass
the
husband
is
occupied
all
day
the
wife
needs
to
cheer
herself
with
a
little
society
and
goes
to
sit
with
neighbors
who
are
not
likely
to
add
anything
valuable
to
her
knowledge
or
to
give
any
elevation
to
her
thoughts
then
comes
the
final
fixing
and
crystallization
of
her
intellect
after
which
however
much
pains
and
labor
might
be
taken
by
the
pair
she
is
past
the
possibility
of
change
these
women
are
often
so
good
and
devoted
that
their
husbands
enjoy
great
happiness
but
it
is
a
kind
of
happiness
curiously
independent
of
the
lady
presence
the
professor
may
love
his
wife
and
fully
appreciate
her
qualities
as
a
housekeeper
but
he
passes
a
more
interesting
evening
with
some
male
friend
whose
reading
is
equal
to
his
own
sometimes
the
lady
perceives
this
and
it
is
an
element
of
sadness
in
her
life
i
never
see
my
husband
she
tells
you
not
in
anger
his
work
occupies
him
all
day
and
in
the
evening
he
sees
his
friends
the
pair
walk
out
together
twice
a
week
i
sometimes
wonder
what
they
say
to
each
other
during
those
conjugal
promenades
they
talk
about
their
children
probably
and
the
little
recurring
difficulties
about
money
he
can
not
talk
about
his
studies
or
the
intellectual
speculations
which
his
studies
continually
suggest
the
most
extreme
cases
of
intellectual
separation
between
husband
and
wife
that
ever
came
under
my
observation
was
however
not
that
of
a
french
professor
but
a
scotch
lawyer
he
was
one
of
the
most
intellectual
men
i
ever
knew
a
little
cynical
but
full
of
original
power
and
uncommonly
his
theory
was
that
women
ought
not
to
be
admitted
into
the
region
of
masculine
thought
that
it
was
not
good
for
them
and
he
acted
so
consistently
up
to
this
theory
that
although
he
would
open
his
mind
with
the
utmost
frankness
to
a
male
acquaintance
over
the
evening
there
was
not
whisky
enough
in
all
scotland
to
make
him
frank
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
she
really
knew
nothing
whatever
about
his
intellectual
existence
and
yet
there
was
nothing
in
his
ways
of
thinking
which
an
honorable
man
need
conceal
from
an
intelligent
woman
his
theory
worked
well
enough
in
practice
and
his
reserve
was
so
perfect
that
it
may
be
doubted
whether
even
feminine
subtlety
ever
suspected
it
the
explanation
of
his
system
may
perhaps
have
been
this
he
was
an
exceedingly
busy
man
he
felt
that
he
had
not
time
to
teach
his
wife
to
know
him
as
he
was
and
so
preferred
to
leave
her
with
her
own
conception
of
him
rather
than
disturb
that
conception
when
he
believed
it
impossible
to
replace
it
by
a
completely
true
one
we
all
act
in
that
way
with
those
whom
we
consider
excluded
from
our
private
range
of
thought
all
this
may
be
very
prudent
and
wise
there
may
be
degrees
of
conjugal
felicity
satisfactory
in
their
way
without
intellectual
intercourse
and
yet
i
can
not
think
that
any
man
of
high
culture
could
regard
his
marriage
as
altogether
a
successful
one
so
long
as
his
wife
remained
shut
out
from
his
mental
life
nor
is
the
exclusion
always
quite
agreeable
to
the
lady
herself
a
widow
said
to
me
that
her
husband
had
never
thought
it
necessary
to
try
to
raise
her
to
his
own
level
yet
she
believed
that
with
his
kindly
help
she
might
have
attained
it
you
with
your
masculine
habits
may
observe
as
to
this
that
if
the
lady
had
seriously
cared
to
attain
a
higher
level
she
might
have
achieved
it
by
her
own
private
independent
effort
but
this
is
exactly
what
the
feminine
nature
never
does
a
clever
woman
is
the
best
of
pupils
when
she
loves
her
teacher
but
the
worst
of
solitary
learners
it
is
not
by
adding
to
our
knowledge
but
by
understanding
us
that
women
are
our
helpers
they
understand
us
far
better
than
men
do
when
once
they
have
the
degree
of
preliminary
information
which
enables
them
to
enter
into
our
pursuits
men
are
occupied
with
their
personal
works
and
thoughts
and
have
wonderfully
little
sympathy
left
to
enable
them
to
comprehend
us
but
a
woman
by
her
divine
sympathy
divine
indeed
since
it
was
given
by
god
for
this
can
enter
into
our
inmost
thought
and
make
allowances
for
all
our
difficulties
talk
about
your
work
and
its
anxieties
to
a
club
of
masculine
friends
they
will
give
very
little
heed
to
you
they
are
all
thinking
about
themselves
and
they
will
dislike
your
egotism
because
they
have
so
much
egotism
of
their
own
which
yours
invades
and
inconveniences
but
talk
in
the
same
way
to
any
woman
who
has
education
enough
to
enable
her
to
follow
you
and
she
will
listen
so
kindly
and
so
very
intelligently
that
you
will
be
betrayed
into
interminable
confidences
now
although
an
intellectual
man
may
not
care
to
make
himself
understood
by
all
the
people
in
the
street
it
is
not
a
good
thing
for
him
to
feel
that
he
is
understood
by
nobody
the
intellectual
life
is
sometimes
a
fearfully
solitary
one
unless
he
lives
in
a
great
capital
the
man
devoted
to
that
life
is
more
than
all
other
men
liable
to
suffer
from
isolation
to
feel
utterly
alone
beneath
the
deafness
of
space
and
the
silence
of
the
stars
give
him
one
friend
who
can
understand
him
who
will
not
leave
him
who
will
always
be
accessible
by
day
and
night
one
friend
one
kindly
listener
just
one
and
the
whole
universe
is
changed
it
is
deaf
and
indifferent
no
longer
and
whilst
listens
it
seems
as
if
all
men
and
angels
listened
also
so
perfectly
his
thought
is
mirrored
in
the
light
of
her
answering
eyes
letter
iii
to
a
young
gentleman
who
contemplated
marriage
the
intellectual
ideal
of
marriage
the
danger
of
dulness
to
be
counteracted
only
by
the
renewal
of
both
minds
example
of
lady
baker
separation
of
the
sexes
by
an
old
prejudice
about
education
this
prejudice
on
the
decline
influence
of
the
late
prince
consort
how
far
may
you
hope
to
realize
the
intellectual
ideal
of
marriage
have
i
ever
observed
in
actual
life
any
approximate
realization
of
that
ideal
these
are
the
two
questions
which
conclude
and
epitomize
the
last
of
your
recent
letters
let
me
endeavor
to
answer
them
as
satisfactorily
as
the
obscurity
of
the
subject
will
permit
the
intellectual
ideal
seems
to
be
that
of
a
conversation
on
all
the
subjects
you
most
care
about
which
should
never
lose
its
interest
is
it
possible
that
two
people
should
live
together
and
talk
to
each
other
every
day
for
twenty
years
without
knowing
each
other
views
too
well
for
them
to
seem
worth
expressing
or
worth
listening
to
there
are
friends
whom
we
know
well
so
that
our
talk
with
them
has
less
of
refreshment
and
entertainment
than
a
conversation
with
the
first
intelligent
stranger
on
the
of
the
steamboat
it
is
evident
that
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
this
is
the
great
danger
of
marriage
it
may
become
dull
not
because
the
mental
force
of
either
of
the
parties
has
declined
but
because
each
has
come
to
know
so
accurately
beforehand
what
the
other
will
say
on
any
given
topic
that
inquiry
is
felt
to
be
useless
this
too
perfect
intimacy
which
has
ended
many
a
friendship
outside
of
marriage
may
also
terminate
the
intellectual
life
in
matrimony
itself
let
us
not
pass
too
lightly
over
this
danger
for
it
is
not
to
be
denied
unless
carefully
provided
against
it
will
gradually
extinguish
the
light
that
plays
between
the
wedded
intelligences
as
the
electric
light
burns
between
two
carbon
points
i
venture
to
suggest
however
that
this
evil
may
be
counteracted
by
persons
of
some
energy
and
originality
this
is
one
of
those
very
numerous
cases
in
which
an
evil
is
sure
to
arrive
if
nothing
is
done
to
prevent
it
yet
in
which
the
evil
need
not
arrive
when
those
whom
it
menaces
are
forewarned
to
take
an
illustration
intelligible
in
these
days
of
we
know
that
if
the
water
is
allowed
to
get
very
low
in
the
boiler
a
destructive
explosion
will
be
the
consequence
yet
since
every
stoker
is
aware
of
this
such
explosions
are
not
of
frequent
occurrence
that
evil
is
continually
approaching
and
yet
continually
averted
by
the
exercise
of
human
foresight
let
us
suppose
that
a
married
couple
are
clearly
aware
that
in
the
course
of
years
their
society
is
sure
to
become
mutually
uninteresting
unless
something
is
done
to
preserve
the
earlier
zest
of
it
what
is
that
something
that
which
an
author
does
for
the
unknown
multitude
of
his
readers
every
author
who
succeeds
takes
the
trouble
to
renew
his
mind
either
by
fresh
knowledge
or
new
thoughts
is
it
not
at
least
equally
worth
while
to
do
as
much
to
preserve
the
interest
of
marriage
without
undervaluing
the
friendly
adhesion
of
many
readers
without
affecting
any
contempt
for
fame
which
is
dearer
to
the
human
heart
than
wealth
itself
whenever
it
appears
to
be
not
wholly
unattainable
may
not
i
safely
affirm
that
the
interest
of
married
life
from
its
very
has
a
still
stronger
influence
upon
the
mind
of
any
thinking
person
of
either
sex
than
the
approbation
of
unnumbered
readers
in
distinct
countries
or
continents
you
never
the
effect
of
your
thinking
on
your
readers
they
live
and
die
far
away
from
you
a
few
write
letters
of
praise
or
criticism
the
thousands
give
no
sign
but
the
wife
is
with
you
always
she
is
almost
as
near
to
you
as
your
own
body
the
world
to
you
is
a
in
which
there
is
one
figure
the
rest
is
merely
background
and
if
an
author
takes
pains
to
renew
his
mind
for
the
people
in
the
background
is
it
not
at
least
equally
worth
your
while
to
bring
fresh
thought
for
the
renewal
of
your
life
with
her
this
then
is
my
theory
of
the
intellectual
marriage
that
the
two
wedded
intellects
ought
to
renew
themselves
continually
for
each
other
and
i
argue
that
if
this
were
done
in
earnest
the
otherwise
inevitable
dulness
would
be
perpetually
kept
at
bay
to
the
other
question
whether
in
actual
life
i
have
ever
seen
this
realized
i
answer
yes
in
several
instances
not
in
very
many
instances
yet
in
more
than
one
women
when
they
have
conceived
the
idea
that
this
renewal
is
necessary
have
resolution
enough
for
the
realization
of
it
there
is
hardly
any
task
too
hard
for
them
if
they
believe
it
essential
to
the
conjugal
life
i
could
give
you
the
name
and
address
of
one
who
mastered
greek
in
order
not
to
be
excluded
from
her
husband
favorite
pursuit
others
have
mastered
other
languages
for
the
same
object
and
even
some
branch
of
science
for
which
the
feminine
mind
has
less
natural
affinity
than
it
has
for
imaginative
literature
their
remarkable
incapacity
for
independent
mental
labor
is
accompanied
by
an
equally
remarkable
capacity
for
labor
under
an
accepted
masculine
guidance
in
this
connection
i
may
without
impropriety
mention
one
englishwoman
for
she
is
already
celebrated
the
wife
of
sir
samuel
baker
the
discoverer
of
the
albert
nyanza
she
stood
with
him
on
the
shore
of
that
unknown
sea
when
first
it
was
beheld
by
english
eyes
she
had
passed
with
him
through
all
the
hard
preliminary
toils
and
trials
she
had
learned
arabic
with
him
in
a
year
of
necessary
but
wearisome
delay
her
mind
had
travelled
with
his
mind
as
her
feet
had
followed
his
footsteps
scarcely
less
beautiful
if
less
heroic
is
the
picture
of
the
geologist
wife
buckland
who
taught
herself
to
reconstruct
broken
fossils
and
did
it
with
a
surprising
delicacy
and
patience
and
skill
full
of
science
yet
more
than
science
the
perfection
of
feminine
art
the
privacy
of
married
life
often
prevents
us
from
knowing
the
extent
to
which
intelligent
women
have
renewed
their
minds
by
fresh
and
varied
culture
for
the
purpose
of
retaining
their
ascendency
over
their
husbands
or
to
keep
up
the
interest
of
their
lives
it
is
done
much
more
frequently
by
women
than
by
men
they
have
so
much
less
egotism
so
much
more
adaptability
that
they
fit
themselves
to
us
oftener
than
we
adapt
ourselves
to
them
but
in
a
quiet
perfect
marriage
these
efforts
would
be
mutual
the
husband
would
endeavor
to
make
life
interesting
to
his
companion
by
taking
a
share
in
some
pursuit
which
was
really
her
own
it
is
easier
for
us
than
it
was
for
our
ancestors
to
do
this
at
least
for
our
immediate
ancestors
there
existed
fifty
years
ago
a
most
irrational
prejudice
very
strongly
rooted
in
the
social
conventions
of
the
time
about
masculine
and
feminine
accomplishments
the
educations
of
the
two
sexes
were
so
trenchantly
separated
that
neither
had
access
to
the
knowledge
of
the
other
the
men
had
learned
latin
and
greek
of
which
the
women
were
ignorant
the
women
had
learned
french
or
italian
which
the
men
could
neither
read
nor
speak
the
ladies
studied
fine
art
not
seriously
but
it
occupied
a
good
deal
of
their
time
and
thoughts
the
gentlemen
had
a
manly
contempt
for
it
which
kept
them
as
contempt
always
does
in
a
state
of
absolute
ignorance
the
intellectual
separation
of
the
sexes
was
made
as
complete
as
possible
by
the
conventionally
received
idea
that
a
man
could
not
learn
what
girls
learned
without
effeminacy
and
that
if
women
aspired
to
men
knowledge
they
would
forfeit
the
delicacy
of
their
sex
this
illogical
prejudice
was
based
on
a
bad
syllogism
of
this
kind
girls
speak
french
and
learn
music
and
drawing
benjamin
speaks
french
and
learns
music
and
drawing
benjamin
is
a
girl
and
the
prejudice
powerful
as
it
was
had
not
even
the
claim
of
any
considerable
antiquity
think
how
strange
and
unreasonable
it
would
have
seemed
to
lady
jane
grey
and
sir
philip
sidney
in
their
time
ladies
and
gentlemen
studied
the
same
things
the
world
of
culture
was
the
same
for
both
and
they
could
meet
in
it
as
in
a
garden
happily
we
are
coming
back
to
the
old
rational
notion
of
culture
as
independent
of
the
question
of
sex
latin
and
greek
are
not
unfeminine
they
were
spoken
by
women
in
athens
and
rome
the
modern
languages
are
fit
for
a
man
to
learn
since
men
use
them
continually
on
the
and
in
the
parliaments
and
exchanges
of
the
world
art
is
a
manly
business
if
ever
any
human
occupation
could
be
called
manly
for
the
utmost
efforts
of
the
strongest
men
are
needed
for
success
in
it
the
increasing
interest
in
the
fine
arts
the
more
important
position
given
to
modern
languages
in
the
universities
the
irresistible
attractions
and
growing
authority
of
science
all
tend
to
bring
men
and
women
together
on
subjects
understood
by
both
and
therefore
operate
directly
in
favor
of
intellectual
interests
in
marriage
you
will
not
suspect
me
of
a
snobbish
desire
to
pay
compliments
to
royalty
if
i
trace
some
of
these
changes
in
public
opinion
to
the
example
and
influence
of
the
prince
consort
operating
with
some
effect
during
his
life
yet
with
far
greater
force
since
he
was
taken
away
from
us
the
truth
is
that
the
most
modern
english
ideal
of
gentlemanly
culture
is
that
which
prince
albert
to
a
great
extent
realized
in
his
own
person
perhaps
his
various
accomplishments
may
be
a
little
embellished
or
exaggerated
in
the
popular
belief
but
it
is
unquestionable
that
his
notion
of
culture
was
very
large
and
liberal
and
quite
beyond
the
narrow
pedantry
of
the
preceding
age
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
exclude
a
woman
and
we
know
that
she
who
loved
him
entered
largely
into
the
works
and
recreations
of
his
life

archimedes

rarity
of
inventions
due
to

exceptions
before
saying
much
about
the
influence
of
marriage
on
the
intellectual
life
it
is
necessary
to
make
some
inquiry
into
the
intellectual
nature
of
women
the
first
thing
to
be
noted
is
that
with
exceptions
so
rare
as
to
be
practically
of
no
importance
to
an
argument
women
do
not
of
themselves
undertake
intellectual
labor
even
in
the
situations
most
favorable
for
labor
of
that
kind
women
do
not
undertake
it
unless
they
are
urged
to
it
and
directed
in
it
by
some
powerful
masculine
influence
in
the
absence
of
that
influence
although
their
minds
are
active
that
activity
neither
tends
to
discipline
nor
to
the
accumulation
of
knowledge
women
who
are
not
impelled
by
some
masculine
influence
are
not
superior
either
in
knowledge
or
discipline
of
the
mind
at
the
age
of
fifty
to
what
they
were
at
the
age
of
in
other
words
they
have
not
in
themselves
the
motive
powers
which
can
cause
an
intellectual
advance
the
best
illustration
of
this
is
a
sisterhood
of
three
or
four
rich
old
maids
with
all
the
advantages
of
leisure
you
will
observe
that
they
invariably
remain
as
to
their
education
where
they
were
left
by
their
teachers
many
years
before
they
will
often
lament
perhaps
that
in
their
day
education
was
very
inferior
to
what
it
is
now
but
it
never
occurs
to
them
that
the
large
leisure
of
subsequent
years
might
had
it
been
well
employed
have
supplied
those
deficiencies
of
which
they
are
sensible
nothing
is
more
curiously
remote
from
masculine
habits
than
the
resignation
to
particular
degrees
of
ignorance
as
to
the
inevitable
which
a
woman
will
express
in
a
manner
which
says
you
know
i
am
so
you
know
that
i
can
not
make
myself
better
informed
they
are
like
perfect
on
a
perfect
table
which
stop
when
no
longer
impelled
wherever
they
may
happen
to
be
it
is
this
absence
of
intellectual
initiative
which
causes
the
great
ignorance
of
women
what
they
have
been
well
taught
that
they
know
but
they
do
not
increase
their
stores
of
knowledge
even
in
what
most
interests
them
theology
they
repeat
but
do
not
extend
their
information
all
the
effort
of
their
minds
appears
so
far
as
an
outside
observer
may
presume
to
judge
to
act
like
water
on
a
picture
which
brings
out
the
colors
that
already
exist
upon
the
canvas
but
does
not
add
anything
to
the
design
there
is
a
great
and
perpetual
freshness
and
vividness
in
their
conceptions
which
is
often
lacking
in
our
own
our
conceptions
fade
and
are
replaced
theirs
are
not
replaced
but
refreshed
what
many
women
do
for
their
theological
conceptions
or
opinions
others
do
with
reference
to
the
innumerable
series
of
questions
of
all
kinds
which
present
themselves
in
the
course
of
life
they
attempt
to
solve
them
by
the
help
of
knowledge
acquired
in
girlhood
and
if
that
can
not
be
done
they
either
give
them
up
as
beyond
the
domain
of
women
or
else
trust
to
hearsay
for
a
solution
what
they
will
do
is
to
hunt
the
matter
out
unaided
and
get
an
accurate
answer
by
dint
of
independent
investigation
there
is
another
characteristic
of
women
not
peculiar
to
them
for
many
men
have
it
in
an
astonishing
degree
and
yet
more
general
in
the
female
sex
than
in
the
male
i
allude
to
the
absence
of
scientific
curiosity
ladies
see
things
of
the
greatest
wonder
and
interest
working
in
their
presence
and
for
their
service
without
feeling
impelled
to
make
any
inquiries
into
the
manner
of
their
working
i
could
mention
many
very
curious
instances
of
this
but
i
select
one
which
seems
typical
many
years
ago
i
happened
to
be
in
a
room
filled
with
english
ladies
most
of
whom
were
highly
intelligent
and
the
conversation
happened
to
turn
upon
a
which
belonged
to
me
one
of
the
ladies
observed
that
sails
were
not
of
much
use
since
they
could
only
be
available
to
push
the
boat
in
the
direction
of
the
wind
a
statement
which
all
the
other
ladies
received
with
approbation
now
all
these
ladies
had
seen
ships
working
under
canvas
against
and
they
might
have
reflected
that
without
that
portion
of
the
art
of
seamanship
every
vessel
unprovided
with
steam
would
assuredly
drift
upon
a
but
it
was
not
in
the
feminine
nature
to
make
a
scientific
observation
of
that
kind
you
will
answer
perhaps
that
i
could
scarcely
expect
ladies
to
investigate
men
business
and
that
seamanship
is
essentially
the
business
of
our
own
sex
but
the
truth
is
that
all
english
people
no
matter
of
what
sex
have
so
direct
an
interest
in
the
maritime
activity
of
england
that
they
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
know
the
one
primary
conquest
on
which
for
many
centuries
that
activity
has
depended
the
conquest
of
the
opposing
wind
the
sublimest
of
the
early
victories
of
science
and
this
absence
of
curiosity
in
women
extends
to
things
they
use
every
day
they
never
seem
to
want
to
know
the
insides
of
things
as
we
do
all
ladies
know
that
steam
makes
a
locomotive
go
but
they
rest
satisfied
with
that
and
do
not
inquire
further
the
steam
sets
the
wheels
in
motion
they
know
that
it
is
necessary
to
wind
up
their
watches
but
they
do
not
care
to
inquire
into
the
real
effects
of
that
little
exercise
of
force
now
this
absence
of
the
investigating
spirit
has
very
wide
and
important
consequences
the
first
consequence
of
it
is
that
women
do
not
naturally
accumulate
accurate
knowledge
left
to
themselves
they
accept
various
kinds
of
teaching
but
they
do
not
by
any
analysis
of
their
own
either
put
that
teaching
to
any
serious
intellectual
test
or
qualify
themselves
for
any
extension
of
it
by
independent
and
original
discovery
we
of
the
male
sex
are
seldom
clearly
aware
how
much
of
our
practical
force
of
the
force
which
discovers
and
originates
is
due
to
our
common
habit
of
analytical
observation
yet
it
is
scarcely
too
much
to
say
that
most
of
our
inventions
have
been
suggested
by
actually
or
intellectually
pulling
something
else
in
pieces
and
such
of
our
discoveries
as
can
not
be
traced
directly
to
analysis
are
almost
always
due
to
habits
of
general
observation
which
lead
us
to
take
note
of
some
fact
apparently
quite
remote
from
what
it
helps
us
to
arrive
at
one
of
the
best
instances
of
this
indirect
utility
of
habitual
observation
as
it
is
one
of
the
earliest
is
what
occurred
to
archimedes
in
his
bath
when
the
water
displaced
by
his
body
overflowed
he
noticed
the
fact
of
displacement
and
at
once
perceived
its
applicability
to
the
cubic
measurement
of
complicated
bodies
it
is
possible
that
if
his
mind
had
not
been
exercised
at
the
time
about
the
adulteration
of
the
royal
crown
it
would
not
have
been
led
to
anything
by
the
overflowing
of
his
bath
but
the
capacity
to
receive
a
suggestion
of
that
kind
is
i
believe
a
capacity
exclusively
masculine
a
woman
would
have
noticed
the
overflowing
but
she
would
have
noticed
it
only
as
a
cause
of
disorder
or
inconvenience
this
absence
of
the
investigating
and
discovering
tendencies
in
women
is
confirmed
by
the
extreme
rarity
of
inventions
due
to
women
even
in
the
things
which
most
interest
and
concern
them
the
and
the
are
the
two
inventions
which
would
most
naturally
have
been
hit
upon
by
women
for
people
are
naturally
inventive
about
things
which
relieve
of
labor
or
which
increase
their
own
possibilities
of
production
and
yet
the
and
the
are
both
of
them
masculine
ideas
carried
out
to
practical
efficiency
by
masculine
energy
and
perseverance
so
i
believe
that
all
the
improvements
in
pianos
are
due
to
men
though
women
have
used
pianos
much
more
than
men
have
used
them
this
then
is
in
my
view
the
most
important
negative
characteristic
of
women
that
they
do
not
push
forwards
intellectually
by
their
own
force
there
have
been
a
few
instances
in
which
they
have
written
with
power
and
originality
have
become
learned
and
greatly
superior
no
doubt
to
the
majority
of
men
there
are
three
or
four
women
in
england
and
as
many
on
the
continent
who
have
lived
intellectually
in
harness
for
many
years
and
who
unaffectedly
delight
in
strenuous
intellectual
labor
giving
evidence
both
of
fine
natural
powers
and
the
most
persevering
culture
but
these
women
have
usually
been
encouraged
in
their
work
by
some
near
masculine
influence
and
even
if
it
were
possible
which
it
is
not
to
point
to
some
female
archimedes
or
leonardo
da
vinci
it
is
not
the
rare
exceptions
which
concern
us
but
the
prevalent
rule
of
nature
without
desiring
to
compare
our
most
learned
ladies
with
anything
so
disagreeable
to
the
eye
as
a
bearded
woman
i
may
observe
that
nature
generally
has
a
few
exceptions
to
all
her
rules
and
that
as
women
having
beards
are
a
physical
exception
so
women
who
naturally
study
and
investigate
are
intellectual
exceptions
once
more
let
me
repudiate
any
malicious
intention
in
establishing
so
unfortunate
and
an
association
of
ideas
for
nothing
is
less
agreeable
than
a
woman
with
a
beard
whilst
on
the
contrary
the
most
intellectual
of
women
may
at
the
same
time
be
the
most
permanently
charming
letter
to
a
young
gentleman
who
contemplated
marriage
the
danger
of
deviation
danger
from
increased
expenditure
nowhere
so
great
as
in
england
complete
absorption
in
business
case
of
a
tradesman
case
of
a
solicitor
the
pursuit
of
comfort
dangerous
to
the
intellectual
life
the
meanness
of
its
results
fireside
purposes
danger
of
deviation
in
rich
marriages
george
sand
study
of
this
in
her
story
of
valvèdre
amongst
the
dangers
of
marriage
one
of
those
most
to
be
dreaded
by
a
man
given
to
intellectual
pursuits
is
the
deviation
which
in
one
way
or
other
marriage
inevitably
produces
it
acts
like
the
pointsman
on
a
railway
who
by
pulling
a
lever
sends
the
train
in
another
direction
the
married
man
never
goes
or
hardly
ever
goes
exactly
on
the
same
intellectual
lines
which
he
would
have
followed
if
he
had
remained
a
bachelor
this
deviation
may
or
may
not
be
a
gain
it
is
always
a
most
serious
danger
sometimes
the
deviation
is
produced
by
the
necessity
for
a
stricter
attention
to
money
causing
a
more
unremitting
application
to
work
that
pays
well
and
a
proportionate
neglect
of
that
which
can
only
give
extension
to
our
knowledge
and
clearness
to
our
views
in
no
country
is
this
danger
so
great
as
it
is
in
england
where
the
generally
expensive
manner
of
living
and
the
prevalent
desire
to
keep
families
in
an
ideally
perfect
state
of
physical
comfort
produce
an
absorption
in
business
which
in
all
but
the
rarest
instances
leaves
no
margin
for
intellectual
labor
there
are
no
doubt
some
remarkable
examples
of
men
earning
a
large
income
by
a
laborious
profession
who
have
gained
reputation
in
one
of
the
sciences
or
in
some
branch
of
literature
but
these
are
very
exceptional
cases
a
man
who
works
at
his
profession
as
most
englishmen
with
large
families
have
to
work
can
seldom
enjoy
that
surplus
of
nervous
energy
which
would
be
necessary
to
carry
him
far
in
literature
or
science
i
remember
meeting
an
english
tradesman
in
the
railway
between
paris
and
the
coast
who
told
me
that
he
was
obliged
to
visit
france
very
frequently
yet
could
not
speak
french
which
was
a
great
deficiency
and
inconvenience
to
him
why
not
learn
i
then
asked
and
received
the
following
answer
i
have
to
work
at
my
business
all
day
long
and
often
far
into
the
night
when
the
day
work
is
over
i
generally
feel
very
tired
and
want
rest
but
if
i
do
happen
to
feel
quite
so
tired
then
it
is
not
work
that
i
need
but
recreation
of
which
i
get
very
little
i
never
feel
the
courage
to
set
to
work
at
the
french
grammar
though
it
would
be
both
pleasant
and
useful
to
me
to
know
french
indeed
i
constantly
feel
the
want
of
it
it
might
perhaps
be
possible
to
learn
from
a
in
the
railway
train
but
to
save
time
i
always
travel
at
night
being
a
married
man
i
have
to
give
my
whole
attention
to
my
business
a
solicitor
with
a
large
practice
in
london
held
nearly
the
same
language
he
worked
at
his
office
all
day
and
often
brought
home
the
most
difficult
work
for
the
quiet
of
his
own
private
study
after
the
household
had
gone
to
bed
the
little
reading
that
he
could
indulge
in
was
light
reading
in
reality
the
profession
intruded
even
on
his
few
hours
of
leisure
for
he
read
many
of
the
columns
in
the
which
relate
to
law
or
legislation
and
these
make
at
the
end
of
a
few
years
an
amount
of
reading
sufficient
for
the
mastery
of
a
foreign
literature
this
gentleman
answered
very
accurately
to
taine
description
of
the
typical
englishman
absorbed
in
business
and
the
in
these
cases
it
is
likely
that
the
effect
of
marriage
was
not
inwardly
felt
as
a
deviation
but
when
culture
has
been
fairly
begun
and
marriage
hinders
the
pursuit
of
it
or
makes
it
deviate
from
the
chosen
path
then
there
is
often
an
inward
consciousness
of
the
fact
not
without
its
bitterness
a
remarkable
article
on
luxury
in
the
second
volume
of
the
deals
with
this
subject
in
a
manner
evidently
suggested
by
serious
reflection
and
experience
the
writer
considers
the
effects
of
the
pursuit
of
comfort
never
carried
so
far
as
it
is
now
on
the
higher
moral
and
intellectual
life
the
comforts
of
a
bachelor
were
not
what
the
writer
meant
these
are
easily
procured
and
seldom
require
the
devotion
of
all
the
energies
the
comfort
which
is
really
dangerous
to
intellectual
growth
is
that
of
a
family
establishment
because
it
so
easily
becomes
the
one
absorbing
object
of
existence
men
who
began
life
with
the
feeling
that
they
would
willingly
devote
their
powers
to
great
purposes
like
the
noble
examples
of
past
times
who
labored
and
suffered
for
the
intellectual
advancement
of
their
race
and
had
starvation
for
their
reward
or
in
some
cases
even
the
prison
and
the
stake
men
who
in
their
youth
felt
themselves
to
be
heirs
of
a
nobility
of
spirit
like
that
of
bruno
of
swammerdam
of
spinoza
have
too
often
found
themselves
in
the
noon
of
life
concentrating
all
the
energies
of
body
and
soul
on
the
acquisition
of
ugly
millinery
and
uglier
upholstery
and
on
spreading
extravagant
tables
to
feed
uncultivated
guests
it
is
impossible
says
the
writer
of
the
article
just
alluded
to
it
is
impossible
to
say
why
men
were
made
but
assuming
that
they
were
made
for
some
purpose
of
which
the
faculties
which
they
possess
afford
evidence
it
follows
that
they
were
intended
to
do
many
other
things
besides
providing
for
their
families
and
enjoying
their
society
they
were
meant
to
know
to
act
and
to
feel
to
know
everything
which
the
mind
is
able
to
contemplate
to
name
and
to
classify
to
do
everything
which
the
will
prompted
by
the
passions
and
guided
by
the
conscience
can
undertake
and
subject
to
the
same
guidance
to
feel
in
its
utmost
vigor
every
emotion
which
the
contemplation
of
the
various
persons
and
objects
which
surround
us
can
excite
this
view
of
the
objects
of
life
affords
an
almost
infinite
scope
for
human
activity
in
different
directions
but
it
also
shows
that
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
dangerous
to
its
beauty
and
its
worth
to
allow
any
one
side
of
life
to
become
the
object
of
idolatry
and
there
are
many
reasons
for
thinking
that
domestic
happiness
is
rapidly
assuming
that
position
in
the
minds
of
the
more
comfortable
classes
of
englishmen
it
is
a
singular
and
affecting
thing
to
see
how
every
manifestation
of
human
energy
bears
witness
to
the
shrewdness
of
the
current
maxim
that
a
large
income
is
a
necessary
of
life
whatever
is
done
for
money
is
done
admirably
well
give
a
man
a
specific
thing
to
make
or
to
write
and
pay
him
well
for
it
and
you
may
with
a
little
trouble
secure
an
excellent
article
but
the
ability
which
does
these
things
so
well
might
have
been
and
ought
to
have
been
trained
to
far
higher
things
which
for
the
most
part
are
left
undone
because
the
clever
workman
thinks
himself
bound
to
earn
what
will
keep
himself
his
wife
and
his
six
or
seven
children
up
to
the
established
standard
of
comfort
what
was
at
first
a
necessity
perhaps
an
unwelcome
one
becomes
by
degrees
a
habit
and
a
pleasure
and
men
who
might
have
done
memorable
and
noble
things
if
they
had
learnt
in
time
to
consider
the
doing
of
such
things
an
object
worth
living
for
lose
the
power
and
the
wish
to
live
for
other
than
fireside
purposes
but
this
kind
of
intellectual
deviation
you
may
answer
is
not
strictly
the
consequence
of
marriage
marriage
it
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
a
degree
of
relative
poverty
produced
by
the
larger
expenditure
of
married
life
but
which
might
be
just
as
easily
produced
by
a
certain
degree
of
in
the
condition
of
a
bachelor
let
me
therefore
point
out
a
kind
of
deviation
which
may
be
as
frequently
observed
in
rich
marriages
as
in
poor
ones
suppose
the
case
of
a
bachelor
with
a
small
but
perfectly
independent
income
amounting
to
some
hundreds
a
year
who
is
devoted
to
intellectual
pursuits
and
spends
his
time
in
study
or
with
cultivated
friends
of
his
own
choosing
friends
whose
society
is
an
encouragement
and
a
help
suppose
that
this
man
makes
an
exceedingly
prudent
marriage
with
a
rich
woman
you
may
safely
predict
in
this
instance
intellectual
deviations
of
a
kind
perilous
to
the
highest
culture
he
will
have
new
calls
upon
his
time
his
society
will
no
longer
be
entirely
of
his
own
choosing
he
will
no
longer
be
able
to
devote
himself
with
absolute
singleness
of
purpose
to
studies
from
which
his
wife
must
necessarily
be
excluded
if
he
were
to
continue
faithful
to
his
old
habits
and
shut
himself
up
every
day
in
his
library
or
laboratory
or
set
out
on
frequent
scientific
expeditions
his
wife
would
either
be
a
lady
of
quite
extraordinary
perfection
of
temper
or
else
entirely
indifferent
in
her
feelings
towards
him
if
she
did
not
regard
his
pursuits
with
jealousy
she
would
think
and
justifiably
think
that
he
ought
to
give
more
of
his
time
to
the
enjoyment
of
her
society
that
he
ought
to
be
more
by
her
side
in
the
carriage
and
in
the
and
if
he
loved
her
he
would
yield
to
these
kindly
and
reasonable
wishes
he
would
spend
many
hours
of
every
day
in
a
manner
not
profitable
to
his
great
pursuits
and
many
weeks
of
every
year
in
visits
to
her
friends
his
position
would
be
even
less
favorable
to
study
in
some
respects
than
that
of
a
professional
man
it
would
be
difficult
for
him
if
an
amateur
artist
to
give
that
unremitting
attention
to
painting
which
the
professional
painter
gives
he
could
not
say
i
do
this
for
you
and
for
our
children
he
could
only
say
i
do
it
for
my
own
pleasure
which
is
not
so
graceful
an
excuse
as
a
bachelor
he
might
work
as
professional
people
work
but
his
marriage
would
strongly
accentuate
the
amateur
character
of
his
position
it
is
possible
that
if
his
labors
had
won
great
fame
the
lady
might
bear
the
separation
more
easily
for
ladies
always
take
a
noble
pride
in
the
celebrity
of
their
husbands
but
the
best
and
worthiest
intellectual
labor
often
brings
no
fame
whatever
and
notoriety
is
a
mere
accident
of
some
departments
of
the
intellectual
life
and
not
its
ultimate
object
george
sand
in
her
admirable
novel
valvèdre
has
depicted
a
situation
of
this
kind
with
the
most
careful
delicacy
of
touch
valvèdre
was
a
man
of
science
who
attempted
to
continue
the
labors
of
his
intellectual
life
after
marriage
had
united
him
to
a
lady
incapable
of
sharing
them
the
reader
pities
both
and
sympathizes
with
both
it
is
hard
on
the
one
hand
that
a
man
endowed
by
nature
with
great
talents
for
scientific
work
should
not
go
on
with
a
career
already
gloriously
begun
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
a
woman
who
is
so
frequently
abandoned
for
science
may
blamelessly
feel
some
jealousy
of
science
valvèdre
in
narrating
the
story
of
his
unhappy
wedded
life
said
that
alida
wished
to
have
at
her
orders
a
perfect
gentleman
to
accompany
her
but
that
he
felt
in
himself
a
more
serious
ambition
he
had
not
aimed
at
fame
but
he
had
thought
it
possible
to
become
a
useful
servant
bringing
his
share
of
patient
and
courageous
seekings
to
the
edifice
of
the
sciences
he
had
hoped
that
alida
would
understand
this
is
time
enough
for
everything
she
said
still
retaining
him
in
the
useless
wandering
life
that
she
had
chosen
he
answered
on
condition
that
i
lose
no
more
of
it
and
it
is
not
in
this
wandering
life
cut
to
pieces
by
a
thousand
unforeseen
interruptions
that
i
can
make
the
hours
yield
their
profit
we
come
to
the
point
exclaimed
alida
impetuously
wish
to
leave
me
and
to
travel
alone
in
impossible
regions
i
will
work
near
you
and
abandon
certain
observations
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
at
too
great
a
distance
but
you
also
will
sacrifice
something
we
will
not
see
so
many
idle
people
we
will
settle
somewhere
for
a
fixed
time
it
shall
be
where
you
will
and
if
the
place
does
not
suit
you
we
will
try
another
but
from
time
to
time
you
will
permit
me
a
phase
of
sedentary
work
yes
you
want
to
live
for
yourself
alone
you
have
lived
enough
for
me
i
understand
your
love
is
satiated
and
at
an
end
nothing
could
conquer
her
conviction
study
was
her
and
that
love
was
only
possible
in
idleness
love
is
everything
she
said
he
who
loves
has
not
time
to
concern
himself
with
anything
else
whilst
the
husband
is
intoxicating
himself
with
the
marvels
of
science
the
wife
languishes
and
dies
it
is
the
destiny
which
awaits
me
and
since
i
am
a
burden
to
you
i
should
do
better
to
die
at
once
a
little
later
valvèdre
ventured
to
hint
something
about
work
hoping
to
conquer
his
wife
on
which
she
proclaimed
the
hatred
of
work
as
a
sacred
right
of
her
nature
and
position
ever
taught
me
to
work
she
said
i
did
not
marry
under
a
promise
to
begin
again
at
the
of
things
whatever
i
know
i
have
learned
by
intuition
by
reading
without
aim
or
method
i
am
a
woman
my
destiny
is
to
love
my
husband
and
bring
up
children
it
is
very
strange
that
my
husband
should
be
the
person
who
counsels
me
to
think
of
something
better
i
am
far
from
suggesting
that
madame
valvèdre
is
an
exact
representative
of
her
sex
but
the
sentiments
which
in
her
are
exaggerated
and
expressed
with
passionate
plainness
are
in
much
milder
form
very
prevalent
sentiments
indeed
and
valvèdre
great
difficulty
how
to
get
leave
to
prosecute
his
studies
with
the
degree
of
devotion
necessary
to
make
them
fruitful
is
not
at
all
an
uncommon
difficulty
with
intellectual
men
after
marriage
the
character
of
madame
valvèdre
being
passionate
and
excessive
led
her
to
an
open
expression
of
her
feelings
but
feelings
of
a
like
kind
though
milder
in
degree
exist
frequently
below
the
surface
and
may
be
detected
by
any
vigilant
observer
of
human
nature
that
such
feelings
are
very
natural
it
is
impossible
even
for
a
to
deny
but
whilst
admitting
the
clear
right
of
a
woman
to
be
preferred
by
a
man
to
science
when
once
he
has
married
her
let
me
observe
that
the
man
might
perhaps
do
wisely
before
the
knot
is
tied
to
ascertain
whether
her
intellectual
dowry
is
rich
enough
to
compensate
him
for
the
sacrifices
she
is
likely
to
exact
letter

a

of
a
near
intellectual
friendship

persons
who
live
independently

women
by

more
subservient
to

than

and

de

the
marriages
of
eccentrics
their
wives
either
protect
them
or
attempt
to
reform
them
isolated
as
you
are
by
the
very
superiority
of
your
culture
from
the
ignorant
provincial
world
around
you
i
can
not
but
believe
that
marriage
is
essential
to
your
intellectual
health
and
welfare
if
you
married
some
cultivated
woman
bred
in
the
cultivated
society
of
a
great
capital
that
companionship
would
give
you
an
independence
of
surrounding
influences
which
nothing
else
can
give
you
fancy
that
by
shutting
yourself
up
in
a
country
house
you
are
uninfluenced
by
the
world
around
you
it
is
a
great
error
you
know
that
you
are
isolated
that
you
are
looked
upon
and
probably
ridiculed
as
an
eccentric
and
this
knowledge
which
it
is
impossible
to
banish
from
your
mind
deprives
your
thinking
of
elasticity
and
grace
you
urgently
need
the
support
of
an
intellectual
friendship
quite
near
to
you
under
your
own
roof
bachelors
in
great
cities
feel
this
necessity
less
still
remember
that
whoever
has
arranged
his
life
independently
of
custom
runs
a
peculiar
risk
in
marriage
women
are
by
nature
far
more
subservient
to
custom
than
we
are
more
than
we
can
easily
conceive
the
danger
of
marriage
for
a
person
of
your
tastes
is
that
a
woman
entering
your
house
might
enter
it
as
the
representative
of
that
authority
which
you
continually
ignore
and
let
us
never
forget
that
a
perfect
obedience
to
custom
requires
great
sacrifices
of
time
and
money
that
you
might
not
be
disposed
to
make
and
which
certainly
would
interfere
with
study
you
value
and
enjoy
your
solitude
well
knowing
how
great
a
thing
it
is

de
sénancour
had
plans
of
studious
retirement
and
hoped
that
the
of
marriage
might
be
compatible
with
these
cherished
projects
but
marriage
he
found
drew
him
into
the
circle
of
ordinary
provincial
life
and
he
always
suffered
from
its
influences
you
are
necessarily
an
eccentric
in
the
neighborhood
where
you
live
it
is
an
eccentricity
to
study
for
nobody
but
you
studies
anything
a
man
so
situated
is
fortunate
when
this
feeling
of
eccentricity
is
alleviated
and
unfortunate
when
it
is
increased
a
wife
would
certainly
do
one
or
the
other
married
to
a
very
superior
woman
able
to
understand
the
devotion
to
intellectual
aims
you
would
be
much
relieved
of
the
painful
consciousness
of
eccentricity
but
a
woman
of
less
capacity
would
intensify
it
so
far
as
we
can
observe
the
married
life
of
others
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
met
with
instances
of
men
constituted
and
occupied
very
much
as
you
are
who
have
found
in
marriage
a
strong
protection
against
the
ignorant
judgments
of
their
neighbors
and
an
assurance
of
intellectual
peace
whilst
in
other
cases
it
has
appeared
rather
as
if
their
solitude
were
made
more
a
cause
of
conscious
suffering
as
if
the
walls
of
their
cabinets
were
pulled
down
for
the
boobies
outside
to
stare
at
them
and
laugh
at
them
a
woman
will
either
take
your
side
against
the
customs
of
the
little
world
around
or
she
will
take
the
side
of
custom
against
you
if
she
loves
you
deeply
and
if
there
is
some
visible
result
of
your
labors
in
fame
and
money
she
may
possibly
do
the
first
and
then
she
will
protect
your
tranquillity
better
than
a
force
of
policemen
and
give
you
a
delightful
sense
of
reconciliation
with
all
humanity
but
many
of
her
most
powerful
instincts
tend
the
other
way
she
has
a
natural
sympathy
with
all
the
observances
of
custom
and
you
neglect
them
she
is
fitted
for
social
life
which
you
are
not
unless
you
win
her
wholly
to
your
side
she
may
undertake
the
enterprise
of
curing
your
eccentricities
and
adapting
you
to
the
ideal
of
her
caste
this
may
be
highly
satisfactory
to
the
operator
but
it
is
full
of
inconveniences
to
the
patient
letter
vii
to
a
lady
of
high
culture
who
found
it
difficult
to
associate
with
persons
of
her
own
sex
men
are
not
very
good
judges
of
feminine
conversation
the
interest
of
it
would
be
increased
if
women
could
be
more
freely
initiated
into
great
subjects
small
subjects
interesting
when
seen
in
relation
to
central
ideas
that
ladies
of
superior
faculty
ought
rather
to
elevate
female
society
than
withdraw
from
it
women
when
displaced
do
not
appear
happy
what
you
confided
to
me
in
our
last
interesting
conversation
has
given
me
material
for
reflection
and
afforded
a
glimpse
of
a
state
of
things
which
i
have
sometimes
suspected
without
having
data
for
any
positive
conclusion
the
society
of
women
is
usually
sought
by
men
during
hours
of
mental
relaxation
and
we
naturally
find
such
a
charm
in
their
mere
presence
especially
when
they
are
graceful
or
beautiful
that
we
are
not
very
severe
or
even
accurate
judges
of
the
abstract
intellectual
quality
of
their
talk
but
a
woman
can
not
feel
the
indescribable
charm
which
wins
us
so
easily
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
a
superior
person
of
your
sex
might
be
aware
of
certain
deficiencies
in
her
sisters
which
men
very
readily
overlook
you
tell
me
that
you
feel
embarrassed
in
the
society
of
ladies
because
they
know
so
little
about
the
subjects
which
interest
you
and
are
astonished
when
you
speak
about
anything
really
worth
attention
on
the
other
hand
you
feel
perfectly
at
ease
with
men
of
ability
and
culture
and
most
at
your
ease
with
men
of
the
best
ability
and
the
most
eminent
attainments
what
you
complain
of
chiefly
in
women
seems
to
be
their
impatience
of
varieties
of
thought
which
are
unfamiliar
to
them
and
their
constant
preference
for
small
topics
it
has
long
been
felt
by
men
that
if
women
could
be
more
freely
initiated
into
great
subjects
the
interest
of
general
conversation
would
be
much
increased
the
difficulty
appears
to
lie
in
their
instinctive
habit
of
making
all
questions
personal
questions
the
etiquette
of
society
makes
it
quite
impossible
for
men
to
speak
to
ladies
in
the
manner
which
would
be
intellectually
most
profitable
to
them
we
may
not
teach
because
it
is
pedantic
and
we
may
not
contradict
because
it
is
rude
most
of
the
great
subjects
are
conventionally
held
to
be
closed
so
that
it
is
a
sin
against
good
taste
to
discuss
them
in
every
house
the
ladies
have
a
set
of
fixed
convictions
of
some
kind
which
it
is
not
polite
in
any
man
to
appear
to
doubt
the
consequence
of
these
conventional
rules
is
that
women
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
acquiescence
which
makes
them
intolerant
of
anything
like
bold
and
original
thinking
on
important
subjects
but
as
the
mind
always
requires
free
play
of
some
kind
when
all
the
great
subjects
are
forbidden
it
will
use
its
activity
in
playing
about
little
ones
for
my
part
i
hardly
think
it
desirable
for
any
of
us
to
be
incessantly
coping
with
great
subjects
and
the
ladies
are
right
in
taking
a
lively
interest
in
the
small
events
around
them
but
even
the
small
events
would
have
a
deeper
interest
if
they
were
seen
in
their
true
relations
to
the
great
currents
of
european
thought
and
action
it
is
probably
the
ignorance
of
these
relations
which
more
than
the
smallness
of
the
topics
themselves
makes
feminine
talk
fatiguing
to
you
very
small
things
indeed
have
an
interest
when
exhibited
in
relation
to
larger
as
men
of
science
are
continually
demonstrating
i
have
been
taking
note
lately
of
the
talk
that
goes
on
around
me
and
i
find
that
when
it
is
shallow
and
wearisome
it
is
always
because
the
facts
mentioned
bear
no
reference
to
any
central
or
governing
idea
and
do
not
illustrate
anything
conversation
is
interesting
in
proportion
to
the
originality
of
the
central
ideas
which
serve
as
pivots
and
the
fitness
of
the
little
facts
and
observations
which
are
contributed
by
the
talkers
for
instance
if
people
happened
to
be
talking
about
rats
and
some
one
informed
you
that
he
had
seen
a
rat
last
week
that
would
be
quite
uninteresting
but
you
would
listen
with
greater
attention
if
he
said
the
other
night
as
i
was
going
up
stairs
very
late
i
followed
a
very
fine
rat
who
was
going
up
stairs
too
and
he
was
not
in
the
least
hurried
but
stopped
after
every
two
or
three
steps
to
have
a
look
at
me
and
my
candle
he
was
very
prettily
marked
about
the
face
and
tail
so
i
concluded
that
he
was
not
a
common
rat
but
probably
a
lemming
two
nights
afterwards
i
met
him
again
and
this
time
he
seemed
almost
to
know
me
for
he
quietly
made
room
for
me
as
i
passed
very
likely
he
might
be
easily
tamed
this
is
interesting
because
though
the
fact
narrated
is
still
trifling
it
illustrates
animal
character
if
you
will
kindly
pardon
an
improvement
of
this
subject
as
a
preacher
would
call
it
i
might
add
that
an
intellectual
lady
like
yourself
might
perhaps
do
better
to
raise
the
tone
of
the
feminine
talk
around
her
than
to
withdraw
from
it
in
weariness
there
are
always
in
every
circle
a
few
superior
persons
who
either
from
natural
diffidence
or
because
they
are
not
very
rich
or
because
they
are
too
young
suffer
themselves
to
be
entirely
overwhelmed
by
the
established
mediocrity
around
them
what
they
need
is
a
leader
a
deliverer
is
it
not
in
your
power
to
render
services
of
this
kind
could
you
not
select
from
the
younger
ladies
whom
you
habitually
meet
a
few
who
like
yourself
feel
bored
by
the
dulness
or
triviality
of
what
you
describe
as
the
current
feminine
conversation
there
is
often
a
painful
shyness
which
prevents
people
of
real
ability
from
using
it
for
the
advantage
of
others
and
this
shyness
is
nowhere
so
common
as
in
england
especially
provincial
england
it
feels
the
want
of
a
hardy
example
a
lady
who
talked
really
well
would
no
doubt
run
some
risk
of
being
rather
unpleasantly
isolated
at
first
but
surely
if
she
tried
she
might
ultimately
find
accomplices
you
could
do
much
to
begin
with
by
recommending
literature
and
gradually
awakening
an
interest
in
what
is
truly
worth
attention
it
seems
lamentable
that
every
cultivated
woman
should
be
forced
out
of
the
society
of
her
own
sex
and
made
to
depend
upon
ours
for
conversation
of
that
kind
which
is
an
absolute
necessity
to
the
intellectual
the
truth
is
that
women
so
displaced
never
appear
altogether
happy
and
culture
costs
so
much
downright
hard
work
that
it
ought
not
to
be
paid
for
by
any
suffering
beyond
those
toils
which
are
its
fair
and
natural
price

that
the
greatest
misfortune
in
the
intellectual

of
women
is
that
they
do
not
hear
the
truth
from
men
all
men
in
cultivated
society
say
to
women
as
much
as
possible
that
which
they
may
be
supposed
to
wish
to
hear
and
women
are
so
much
accustomed
to
this
that
they
can
scarcely
hear
without
resentment
an
expression
of
opinion
which
takes
no
account
of
their
personal
and
private
feeling
the
consideration
for
the

of

gives
an
agreeable
tone
to

but
it
is
fatal
to
the
severity
of
truth
observe
a
man
of
the
world
whose
opinions
are
well
known
to
you
notice
the
little
pause
before
he
speaks
to
a
lady
during
that
little
pause
he
is
turning
over
what
he
has
to
say
so
as
to
present
it
in
the
manner
that
will
please
her
best
and
you
may
be
sure
that
the
integrity
of
truth
will
suffer
in
the
process
if
we
compare
what
we
know
of
the
man
with
that
which
the
lady
hears
from
him
we
perceive
the
immense
disadvantages
of
her
position
he
ascertains
what
will
please
her
and
that
is
what
he
administers
he
professes
to
take
a
deep
interest
in
things
which
he
does
not
care
for
in
the
least
and
he
passes
lightly
over
subjects
and
events
which
he
knows
to
be
of
the
most
momentous
importance
to
the
world
the
lady
spends
an
hour
more
agreeably
than
if
she
heard
opinions
which
would
irritate
and
prognostics
which
would
alarm
her
but
she
has
missed
an
opportunity
for
culture
she
has
been
confirmed
in
feminine
illusions
if
this
happened
only
from
time
to
time
the
effect
would
not
tell
so
much
on
the
mental
constitution
but
it
is
incessant
it
is
continual
men
disguise
their
thoughts
for
women
as
if
to
venture
into
the
feminine
world
were
as
dangerous
as
travelling
in
arabia
or
as
if
the
thoughts
themselves
were
criminal
there
appeared
two
or
three
years
ago
in
a
clever
drawing
which
might
have
served
as
an
illustration
to
this
subject
a
fashionable
doctor
was
visiting
a
lady
in
belgravia
who
complained
that
she
suffered
from
debility
oil
being
repugnant
to
her
taste
the
agreeable
doctor
wise
in
his
generation
blandly
suggested
as
an
effective
substitute
a
mixture
of
cream
and
curaçoa
what
that
intelligent
man
did
for
his
patient
physical
constitution
all
men
of
politeness
do
for
the
intellectual
constitution
of
ladies
instead
of
administering
the
truth
which
would
strengthen
though
unpalatable
they
administer
intellectual
cream
and
curaçoa
the
primary
cause
of
this
tendency
to
say
what
is
most
pleasing
to
women
is
likely
to
be
as
permanent
as
the
distinction
of
sex
itself
it
springs
directly
from
sexual
feelings
it
is
hereditary
and
instinctive
men
will
never
talk
to
women
with
that
rough
frankness
which
they
use
between
themselves
conversation
between
the
sexes
will
always
be
partially
insincere
still
i
think
that
the
more
women
are
respected
the
more
men
will
desire
to
be
approved
by
them
for
what
they
are
in
reality
and
the
less
they
will
care
for
approval
which
is
obtained
by
dissimulation
it
may
be
observed
already
that
in
the
most
intellectual
society
of
great
capitals
men
are
considerably
more
outspoken
before
women
than
they
are
in
the
provincial
where
women
have
most
culture
men
are
most
open
and
sincere
indeed
the
highest
culture
has
a
direct
tendency
to
command
sincerity
in
others
both
because
it
is
tolerant
of
variety
in
opinion
and
because
it
is
so
penetrating
that
dissimulation
is
felt
to
be
of
no
use
by
the
side
of
an
uncultivated
woman
a
man
feels
that
if
he
says
anything
different
from
what
she
has
been
accustomed
to
she
will
take
offence
whilst
if
he
says
anything
beyond
the
narrow
range
of
her
information
he
will
make
her
cold
and
uncomfortable
the
most
honest
of
men
in
such
a
position
finds
it
necessary
to
be
very
cautious
and
can
scarcely
avoid
a
little
insincerity
but
with
a
woman
of
culture
equal
to
his
own
these
causes
for
apprehension
have
no
existence
and
he
can
safely
be
more
himself
these
considerations
lead
me
to
hope
that
as
culture
becomes
more
general
women
will
hear
truth
more
frequently
whenever
this
comes
to
pass
it
will
be
to
them
an
immense
intellectual
gain

to
matters
of
fact
i
have
been
thinking
a
good
deal
and
seriously
since
we
last
met
about
the
subject
of
our
conversation
which
though
a
painful
one
is
not
to
be
timidly
avoided
the
degree
of
unhappiness
in
your
little
household
which
ought
to
be
one
of
the
pleasantest
of
households
yet
which
as
you
confided
to
me
is
overshadowed
by
a
continual
misunderstanding
is
i
fear
very
common
indeed
at
the
present
day
it
is
only
by
great
forbearance
and
great
skill
that
any
household
in
which
persons
of
very
different
degrees
of
culture
have
to
live
together
on
terms
of
equality
can
be
maintained
in
perfect
peace
and
neither
the
art
nor
the
forbearance
is
naturally
an
attribute
of
youth
a
man
whose
scholarly
attainments
were
equal
to
your
own
and
whose
experience
of
men
and
women
was
wider
could
no
doubt
offer
you
counsel
both
wise
and
practical
yet
i
can
hardly
say
that
i
should
like
you
better
if
you
followed
it
i
can
not
blame
you
for
having
the
natural
characteristics
of
your
years
an
honest
love
of
the
best
truth
that
you
have
attained
to
an
intolerance
of
inaccuracy
on
all
subjects
a
simple
faith
in
the
possibility
of
teaching
others
even
elderly
ladies
when
they
happen
to
know
less
than
yourself
all
these
characteristics
are
in
themselves
blameless
and
yet
in
your
case
and
in
thousands
of
other
similar
cases
they
often
bring
clouds
of
storm
and
trial
upon
houses
which
in
a
less
rapidly
progressive
century
than
our
own
might
have
been
blessed
with
uninterrupted
peace
the
truth
is
that
you
are
in
a
false
position
relatively
to
your
mother
and
your
mother
is
in
a
false
position
relatively
to
you
she
expects
deference
and
deference
is
scarcely
compatible
with
contradiction
certainly
if
there
be
contradiction
at
all
it
must
be
very
rare
very
careful
and
very
delicate
you
on
the
other
hand
although
no
doubt
full
of
respect
and
affection
for
your
mother
in
your
heart
can
not
hear
her
authoritatively
enunciating
anything
that
you
know
to
be
erroneous
without
feeling
irresistibly
urged
to
set
her
right
she
is
rather
a
talkative
lady
she
does
not
like
to
hear
a
conversation
going
forward
without
taking
a
part
in
it
and
rather
an
important
part
so
that
whatever
subject
is
talked
about
in
her
presence
that
subject
she
will
talk
about
also
even
before
specialists
your
mother
has
an
independence
of
opinion
and
a
degree
of
faith
in
her
own
conclusions
which
would
be
admirable
if
they
were
founded
upon
right
reason
and
a
careful
study
of
the
subject
medical
men
and
even
lawyers
do
not
intimidate
her
she
is
convinced
that
she
knows
more
about
disease
than
the
physician
and
more
about
legal
business
than
an
old
attorney
in
theology
no
parson
can
approach
her
but
here
a
woman
may
consider
herself
on
her
own
ground
as
theology
is
the
speciality
of
women
all
this
puts
you
out
of
patience
and
it
is
intelligible
that
for
a
young
gentleman
of
intellectual
habits
and
somewhat
ardent
temperament
like
yourself
it
must
be
at
times
rather
trying
to
have
an
authority
at
hand
ever
ready
to
settle
all
questions
in
a
decisive
manner
to
you
i
have
no
counsel
to
offer
but
that
of
unconditional
submission
you
have
the
weakness
to
enter
into
arguments
when
to
sustain
them
you
must
assume
the
part
of
a
teacher
in
arguing
with
a
person
already
upon
the
subject
in
dispute
you
may
politely
refer
to
knowledge
which
he
already
possesses
but
when
he
does
not
possess
the
knowledge
you
can
not
argue
with
him
you
must
first
teach
him
you
must
become
didactic
and
therefore
odious
i
remember
a
great
scene
which
took
place
between
you
and
your
mother
concerning
the
american
war
it
was
brought
on
by
a
too
precise
answer
of
yours
relatively
to
your
friend
who
had
emigrated
to
america
you
mother
asked
to
what
part
of
america
had
emigrated
and
you
answered
the
argentine
republic
a
shade
of
displeasure
clouded
your
mother
countenance
because
she
did
not
know
where
the
argentine
republic
might
be
and
betrayed
it
by
her
manner
you
imprudently
added
that
it
was
in
south
america
yes
yes
i
know
very
well
she
answered
there
was
a
great
battle
there
during
the
american
war
it
is
well
your
friend
was
not
there
under
jefferson
davis
now
permit
me
to
observe
my
estimable
young
friend
that
this
was
what
the
french
call
a
fine
opportunity
for
holding
your
tongue
but
your
missed
it
fired
with
an
enthusiasm
for
truth
always
dangerous
to
the
peace
of
families
you
began
to
explain
to
the
good
lady
that
the
argentine
republic
though
in
south
america
was
not
one
of
the
southern
states
of
the
union
this
led
to
a
scene
of
which
i
was
the
embarrassed
and
unwilling
witness
your
mother
vehemently
affirmed
that
all
the
southern
states
had
been
under
jefferson
davis
that
she
knew
the
fact
perfectly
that
it
had
always
been
known
to
every
one
during
the
war
and
that
consequently
as
the
argentine
republic
was
in
south
america
the
argentine
republic
had
been
under
jefferson
davis
rapidly
warming
with
this
discussion
your
mother
supposed
that
you
would
deny
next
that
there
had
ever
been
such
a
thing
as
a
war
between
the
north
and
the
south
then
you
in
your
turn
lost
temper
and
you
fetched
an
atlas
for
the
purpose
of
explaining
that
the
southern
division
of
the
continent
of
america
was
not
the
southern
half
of
the
united
states
you
were
landed
as
people
always
are
landed
when
they
prosecute
an
argument
with
the
ignorant
in
the
thankless
office
of
the
schoolmaster
you
were
actually
trying
to
give
your
mother
a
lesson
in
geography
she
was
not
grateful
to
you
for
your
didactic
attentions
she
glanced
at
the
book
as
people
glance
at
an
offered
dish
which
they
dislike
she
does
not
understand
maps
the
representation
of
places
in
geographical
topography
has
never
been
quite
clear
to
her
your
little
geographical
lecture
irritated
but
did
not
inform
it
clouded
the
countenance
but
did
not
illuminate
the
understanding
the
distinction
between
south
america
and
the
southern
states
is
not
easy
to
the
mind
under
any
circumstances
but
when
is
involved
it
becomes
impossible
i
believe
that
the
best
course
in
discussions
of
this
kind
with
ladies
is
simply
to
say
what
is
true
for
the
acquittal
of
your
own
conscience
but
after
that
to
remain
silent
on
that
topic
leaving
the
last
word
to
the
lady
who
will
probably
simply
what
she
has
already
said
for
example
in
the
discussion
about
the
argentine
republic
your
proper
course
would
have
been
to
say
first
firmly
that
the
territory
in
question
was
not
a
part
of
the
seceded
states
and
had
never
been
in
the
union
with
a
brief
and
decided
geographical
explanation
your
mother
would
not
have
been
convinced
by
this
and
would
probably
have
had
the
last
word
but
the
matter
would
have
ended
there
another
friend
of
mine
who
is
in
a
position
very
like
your
own
goes
a
step
farther
and
is
determined
to
agree
with
his
in
everything
he
always
assents
to
her
propositions
she
is
a
frenchwoman
and
has
been
accustomed
to
use
and
as
convertible
terms
somebody
spoke
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
as
being
in
africa
then
it
belongs
to
france
as
africa
belongs
to
france
oui
chère
mère
he
answered
in
his
usual
formula
vous
avez
raison
he
alluded
to
this
afterwards
when
we
were
alone
together
i
was
foolish
enough
some
years
since
he
said
to
argue
with
my
and
try
to
teach
her
little
things
from
time
to
time
but
it
kept
her
in
a
state
of
chronic
and
led
to
no
good
it
spoiled
her
temper
and
it
did
not
improve
her
mind
but
since
i
have
adopted
the
plan
of
perpetual
assent
we
get
on
charmingly
whatever
she
affirms
i
assent
to
at
once
and
all
is
well
my
friends
are
in
the
secret
and
so
no
contradictory
truth
disturbs
our
amiable
tranquillity
a
system
of
this
kind
spoils
women
completely
and
makes
the
least
contradiction
intolerable
to
them
it
is
better
that
they
should
at
least
have
the
opportunity
of
hearing
truth
though
no
attempt
need
be
made
to
force
it
upon
them
the
position
of
ladies
of
the
generation
which
preceded
ours
is
in
many
respects
a
very
trying
one
and
we
do
not
always
adequately
realize
it
a
lady
like
your
mother
who
never
really
went
through
any
intellectual
discipline
who
has
no
notion
of
intellectual
accuracy
in
anything
is
compelled
by
the
irresistible
feminine
instinct
to
engage
her
strongest
feelings
in
every
discussion
that
arises
a
woman
can
rarely
detach
her
mind
from
questions
of
persons
to
apply
it
to
questions
of
fact
she
does
not
think
simply
is
that
true
of
such
a
thing
but
she
thinks
does
he
love
me
or
respect
me
the
facts
about
the
argentine
republic
and
the
american
war
were
probably
quite
indifferent
to
your
mother
but
your
opposition
to
what
she
had
asserted
seemed
to
her
a
failure
in
affection
and
your
attempt
to
teach
her
a
failure
in
respect
this
feeling
in
women
is
far
from
being
wholly
egoistic
they
refer
everything
to
persons
but
not
necessarily
to
their
own
persons
whatever
you
affirm
as
a
fact
they
find
means
of
interpreting
as
loyalty
or
disloyalty
to
some
person
whom
they
either
venerate
or
love
to
the
head
of
religion
or
of
the
state
or
of
the
family
hence
it
is
always
dangerous
to
enter
upon
intellectual
discussion
of
any
kind
with
women
for
you
are
almost
certain
to
offend
them
by
setting
aside
the
sentiments
of
veneration
affection
love
which
they
have
in
great
strength
in
order
to
reach
accuracy
in
matters
of
fact
which
they
neither
have
nor
care

part

in

most
widely
different
positions
and
by
means
of
their

letters
usually
much
more
frank
than
any

to
gain
a
singularly
accurate

into

circumstances
on

and

the
same
post
that
brought
me
your
last
letter
brought
news
about
another
of
my
friends
whose
lot
has
been
a
striking
contrast
to
your
own
let
me
dwell
upon
this
contrast
for
a
few
minutes
all
the
sunshine
appears
to
have
been
on
your
side
and
all
the
shadow
on
his
born
of
highly
cultivated
parents
in
the
highest
rank
in
england
under
royalty
you
have
lived
from
the
beginning
amongst
the
most
efficient
aids
to
culture
and
nature
has
so
endowed
you
that
instead
of
becoming
indifferent
to
these
things
from
familiarity
you
have
learned
to
value
them
more
and
more
in
every
successive
year
the
plainest
statement
of
your
advantages
would
sound
like
an
extract
from
one
of
novels
your
father
principal
castle
is
situated
amongst
the
finest
scenery
in
britain
and
his
palace
in
london
is
filled
with
masterpieces
of
art
wherever
you
have
lived
you
have
been
surrounded
by
good
literature
and
cultivated
friends
your
health
is
steadily
robust
you
can
travel
wherever
you
choose
and
all
the
benefits
of
all
the
capitals
of
europe
belong
to
you
as
much
as
to
their
own
citizens
in
all
these
gifts
and
opportunities
there
is
but
one
evil
the
bewilderment
of
their
multiplicity
my
other
correspondent
has
been
less
fortunately
situated
i
began
school
he
says
when
six
years
old
was
taken
from
it
at
eleven
and
sent
to
the
mines
to
earn
a
little
towards
my
own
support
i
continued
there
till
fourteen
when
through
an
unlucky
incident
i
was
made
a
hopeless
cripple
at
that
day
i
was
earning
the
noble
sum
of
eightpence
per
day
quite
as
much
as
any
boy
of
that
age
got
in
the
lead
mines
i
suffered
much
for
two
years
after
that
became
much
easier
but
my
legs
were
quite
useless
and
have
continued
so
up
to
the
present
time
the
right
is
decayed
has
not
got
worse
these
nine
years
therefore
i
conclude
that
i
may
live
say
another
thirty
years
i
should
at
all
events
for
life
sweet
even
at
this
cost
not
but
what
i
could
die
quietly
enough
i
dare
say
i
have
not
been
idle
these
years
here
permit
me
to
introduce
a
parenthesis
he
certainly
had
been
idle
he
had
educated
himself
up
to
such
a
point
that
he
could
really
appreciate
both
literature
and
art
and
had
attained
some
genuine
skill
in
both
his
letters
to
me
were
the
letters
of
a
cultivated
gentleman
and
he
used
invariably
to
insert
little
which
were
done
with
a
light
and
refined
hand
i
can
do
anything
almost
in
bed
except
getting
up
i
am
now
years
old
my
father
was
a
miner
but
is
now
unable
to
work
i
have
only
one
brother
working
and
we
are
about
a
dozen
of
us
consequently
we
are
not
in
the
most
flourishing
circumstances
but
a
friend
has
put
it
in
my
power
to
learn
to
etch
i
have
got
the
tools
and
your
handbook
on
the
subject
these
extracts
are
from
his
first
letter
afterwards
he
wrote
me
others
which
made
me
feel
awed
and
humbled
by
the
manly
cheerfulness
with
which
he
bore
a
lot
so
dreary
and
by
the
firmness
of
resolution
he
showed
in
his
pursuits
he
could
not
quit
his
bed
but
that
was
not
the
worst
he
could
not
even
sit
up
in
bed
and
yet
he
contrived
i
know
not
how
both
to
write
and
draw
and
etch
on
copper
managing
the
plaguy
chemicals
and
even
printing
his
own
proofs
his
bed
was
on
wheels
on
a
sort
of
light
iron
carriage
and
he
saw
nature
all
the
gladness
of
physical
activity
was
completely
blotted
out
of
his
existence
and
in
that
respect
his
prospects
were
without
hope
and
still
he
said
that
life
was
sweet
o
marvel
of
all
marvels
how
that
life
be
sweet
aided
by
a
beautiful
patience
and
resignation
the
lamp
of
the
mind
burned
with
a
steady
brightness
fed
by
his
daily
studies
in
the
winters
however
the
diseased
limb
gave
him
prolonged
agony
and
in
the
autumn
of
to
avoid
the
months
of
torture
that
lay
before
him
he
had
himself
put
in
the
railway
and
sent
off
in
his
bed
to
edinburgh
sleeping
in
a
on
the
way
there
was
no
one
to
attend
him
but
he
trusted
not
vainly
to
the
humanity
of
strangers
just
about
the
same
time
your
lordship
went
northwards
also
with
many
friends
to
enjoy
the
noble
scenery
and
the
excitement
of
noble
sport
my
poor
cripple
got
to
edinburgh
got
a
glimpse
of
scott
monument
and
the
athenian
pillars
and
submitted
himself
to
the
surgeons
they
rendered
him
the
best
of
services
for
they
ended
his
pains
forever
so
i
am
to
get
no
more
of
those
wonderfully
brave
and
cheerful
letters
that
were
written
from
the
little
bed
on
wheels
i
miss
them
for
the
lessons
they
quite
unconsciously
conveyed
he
fancied
that
he
was
the
learner
poor
lad
and
i
the
teacher
whereas
it
was
altogether
the
other
way
he
made
me
feel
what
a
blessing
it
is
even
from
the
purely
intellectual
point
of
view
to
be
able
to
get
out
of
bed
after
the
night
rest
and
go
from
one
room
to
another
he
made
me
understand
the
value
of
every
liberty
and
every
power
whilst
at
the
same
time
he
taught
me
to
bear
more
patiently
every
limit
and
inconvenience
and
restriction
in
comparing
his
letters
with
yours
i
have
been
struck
by
one
reflection
predominantly
which
is
the
entire
absence
of
in
both
of
you
nobody
not
in
the
secret
could
guess
that
one
set
of
letters
came
from
a
palace
and
the
other
set
from
a
poor
miner
cottage
and
even
to
me
who
do
not
see
the
habitations
except
by
an
effort
of
the
memory
or
imagination
there
is
nothing
to
recall
the
immensity
of
the
social
distance
that
separated
my
two
friendly
and
welcome
correspondents
it
is
clear
of
course
that
one
of
them
had
enjoyed
greater
advantages
than
the
other
but
neither
wrote
from
the
point
of
view
which
marks
his
caste
or
class
it
was
my
habit
to
write
to
you
and
to
him
exactly
in
the
same
tone
yet
this
was
not
felt
to
be
unsuitable
by
either
is
it
not
that
the
love
and
pursuit
of
culture
lead
each
of
us
out
of
his
class
and
that
of
any
kind
whether
of
the
aristocracy
or
of
the
middle
class
or
of
the
people
inevitably
narrow
the
mind
and
hinder
it
from
receiving
pure
truth
have
you
ever
known
any
person
who
lived
habitually
in
the
notions
of
a
caste
high
or
low
without
incapacitating
himself
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
for
breadth
and
delicacy
of
perception
it
seems
to
me
that
the
largest
and
best
minds
although
they
have
been
born
and
nurtured
in
this
caste
or
that
and
may
continue
to
conform
externally
to
its
customs
always
emancipate
themselves
from
it
intellectually
and
arrive
at
a
sort
of
neutral
region
where
the
light
is
colorless
and
clear
and
equal
like
plain
daylight
out
of
doors
so
soon
as
we
attain
the
forgetfulness
of
self
and
become
absorbed
in
our
pursuits
for
their
own
sakes
the
feeling
of
caste
drops
off
from
us
it
was
not
a
mark
of
culture
in
tycho
brahe
but
rather
of
the
imperfections
of
his
culture
that
he
felt
so
strongly
the
difficulty
of
conciliating
scientific
pursuits
with
the
obligations
of
noble
birth
and
began
his
public
discourses
on
astronomy
by
telling
his
audience
that
the
work
was
to
his
social
position
hesitating
too
even
about
authorship
from
a
dread
of
social
degradation
and
to
take
an
instance
from
the
opposite
extreme
of
human
society
robert
burns
betrayed
the
same
imperfection
of
culture
in
his
dedication
to
the
members
of
the
caledonian
hunt
when
he
spoke
of
his
honest
rusticity
and
told
the
gentlefolks
that
he
was
bred
to
the
plough
and
independent
both
of
these
men
had
been
unfavorably
situated
for
the
highest
culture
the
one
by
the
ignorance
of
his
epoch
the
other
by
the
ignorance
of
his
class
hence
this
uneasiness
about
themselves
and
their
social
position
shelley
said
of
byron
the
canker
of
aristocracy
wants
to
be
cut
out
and
he
did
not
say
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
democrat
for
shelley
was
not
precisely
a
democrat
but
from
the
broadly
human
point
of
view
on
which
the
finest
intellects
like
to
take
their
stand
shelley
perceived
that
aristocracy
narrowed
him
and
made
his
sympathies
less
catholic
than
they
might
have
been
nor
can
there
be
any
doubt
of
the
accuracy
of
this
estimate
of
shelley
if
a
doubt
existed
it
would
be
removed
by
alternative
for
a
poet
solitude
or
high
life
another
man
of
genius
whose
loss
we
have
recently
deplored
was
narrowed
by
his
antipathy
to
the
aristocratic
spirit
though
it
is
necessary
to
add
in
justice
that
it
did
not
prevent
him
from
valuing
the
friendship
of
noblemen
whom
he
esteemed
the
works
of
charles
dickens
would
have
been
more
accurate
as
pictures
of
english
life
certainly
more
comprehensively
accurate
if
he
could
have
felt
for
the
aristocracy
that
hearty
and
loving
sympathy
which
he
felt
for
the
middle
classes
and
the
people
but
the
narrowness
of
dickens
is
more
excusable
than
that
of
byron
because
a
kindly
heart
more
easily
enters
into
the
feelings
of
those
whom
it
can
often
pity
than
of
those
who
appear
to
be
lifted
above
pity
though
this
is
nothing
but
an
appearance
and
also
because
it
is
the
habit
of
aristocracies
to
repel
such
sympathy
by
their
manners
which
the
poor
do
not
i
have
often
thought
that
a
sign
of
aristocratic
narrowness
in
many
english
authors
including
some
of
the
most
popular
authors
of
the
day
is
the
way
they
speak
of
shopkeepers
this
may
be
due
to
simple
ignorance
but
if
so
it
is
ignorance
that
might
be
easily
avoided
happily
for
our
convenience
there
are
a
great
many
shopkeepers
in
england
so
that
there
is
no
lack
of
the
materials
for
study
but
our
novelists
appear
to
consider
this
important
class
of
englishmen
as
unworthy
of
any
patient
and
serious
portraiture
you
may
remember
anthony
trollope
struggles
of
brown
jones
and
robinson
which
appeared
in
the
under
thackeray
editorship
that
was
an
extreme
instance
of
the
way
the
class
is
treated
in
our
literature
and
then
in
poetry
we
have
some
disdainful
verses
of
tennyson
it
may
be
presumed
that
there
is
material
for
grave
and
respectful
treatment
of
this
extensive
class
but
our
poets
and
novelists
do
not
seem
to
have
discovered
or
sought
to
discover
the
secret
of
that
treatment
the
intensity
of
the
prejudices
of
caste
prevents
them
from
seeing
any
possibility
of
true
gentlemanhood
in
a
draper
or
a
grocer
and
blinds
them
to
the
æsthetic
beauty
or
grandeur
which
may
be
as
perfectly
compatible
with
what
is
disdainfully
called
as
it
is
admitted
to
be
with
the
jumping
of
gates
the
same
caste
prejudices
have
often
kept
the
mass
of
the
upper
classes
in
ignorance
of
most
valuable
and
important
branches
of
knowledge
the
poor
have
been
ignorant
yet
never
proud
of
their
ignorance
the
ignorance
that
men
are
proud
of
belongs
to
caste
always
not
always
to
what
we
should
call
an
aristocratic
caste
but
to
the
in
one
class
or
another
the
pride
of
the
feudal
baron
in
being
totally
illiterate
amounted
to
from
all
intellectual
culture
and
we
may
still
find
living
instances
of
partial
from
culture
of
which
pride
is
the
only
motive
there
are
people
who
pass
their
time
in
what
are
considered
amusements
that
do
not
amuse
because
it
seems
to
them
a
more
gentlemanly
sort
of
life
than
the
devotion
to
some
great
and
worthy
pursuit
which
would
have
given
the
keenest
zest
and
relish
to
their
whole
existence
besides
making
them
useful
members
of
society
which
they
are
not
but
which
happens
to
be
tabooed
for
them
by
the
prejudices
of
their
caste
there
are
many
studies
in
themselves
noble
and
useful
that
a
man
of
good
family
can
not
follow
with
the
earnestness
and
the
sacrifice
of
time
necessary
to
success
in
them
without
incurring
the
disapprobation
of
his
friends
if
this
disapprobation
were
visited
on
the
breaker
of
because
he
neglected
some
other
culture
there
would
still
be
something
reasonable
in
it
but
this
is
not
the
case
the
forbids
the
most
honorable
and
instructive
labor
when
it
does
not
forbid
the
most
unprofitable
idleness
the
most
utter
throwing
away
of
valuable
time
and
faculty
tycho
brahe
feared
to
lose
caste
in
becoming
the
most
illustrious
astronomer
of
his
time
but
he
would
have
had
no
such
apprehension
nor
any
ground
for
such
apprehension
if
instead
of
being
impelled
to
noble
work
by
a
high
intellectual
instinct
he
had
been
impelled
by
meaner
passions
to
unlimited
even
in
our
own
day
these
prejudices
are
still
strong
enough
or
have
been
until
very
lately
to
keep
our
upper
classes
in
great
darkness
about
natural
knowledge
of
all
kinds
and
about
its
application
to
the
arts
of
life
how
few
gentlemen
have
been
taught
to
draw
accurately
and
how
few
are
accurately
acquainted
with
the
great
practical
inventions
of
the
age
the
does
not
in
these
days
keep
them
ignorant
of
literature
but
it
keeps
them
ignorant
of
a
friend
who
had
a
strong
constructive
and
experimental
turn
told
me
that
as
a
rule
he
found
gentlemen
less
capable
of
entering
into
his
ideas
than
common
joiners
and
blacksmiths
because
these
humble
workmen
from
their
habit
of
dealing
with
matter
had
acquired
some
experience
of
its
nature
for
my
own
part
i
have
often
been
amazed
by
the
difficulty
of
making
something
clear
to
a
classically
educated
gentleman
which
any
intelligent
mechanic
would
have
seen
to
the
bottom
and
all
round
after
five
or
six
minutes
of
explanation
there
is
a
certain
french
nobleman
whose
ignorance
i
have
frequent
opportunities
of
fathoming
always
with
fresh
astonishment
at
the
depths
of
it
and
i
declare
that
he
knows
no
more
about
the
properties
of
stone
and
timber
and
metal
than
if
he
were
a
cherub
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
but
there
is
something
in
even
more
prejudicial
to
culture
than
ignorance
itself
and
that
is
the
affectation
of
strong
preferences
for
certain
branches
of
knowledge
in
which
people
are
not
seriously
interested
there
is
nothing
which
people
will
not
pretend
to
like
if
a
liking
for
it
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
marks
and
indications
of
gentility
there
has
been
an
immense
amount
of
this
kind
of
affectation
in
regard
to
classical
scholarship
and
we
know
for
a
certainty
that
it
affectation
whenever
people
are
loud
in
their
praise
of
classical
authors
whom
they
never
take
the
trouble
to
read
it
may
have
happened
to
you
as
it
has
happened
to
me
from
time
to
time
to
hear
men
affirm
the
absolute
necessity
of
classical
reading
to
distinction
of
thought
and
manner
and
yet
to
be
aware
at
the
same
time
from
close
observation
of
their
habits
that
those
very
men
entirely
neglected
the
sources
of
that
culture
in
which
they
professed
such
earnest
faith
the
explanation
is
that
as
classical
accomplishments
are
considered
to
be
one
of
the
evidences
of
gentility
whoever
speaks
loudly
in
their
favor
affirms
that
he
has
the
tastes
and
preferences
of
a
gentleman
it
is
like
professing
the
fashionable
religion
or
belonging
to
an
aristocratic
shade
of
opinion
in
politics
i
have
not
a
doubt
that
all
affectations
of
this
kind
are
injurious
to
genuine
culture
for
genuine
culture
requires
sincerity
of
interest
before
everything
and
the
fashionable
affectations
so
far
from
attracting
sincere
men
to
the
departments
of
learning
which
happen
to
be
la
positively
drive
them
away
just
as
many
have
become
nonconformists
because
the
established
religion
was
considered
necessary
to
gentility
who
might
have
remained
contented
with
its
ordinances
as
a
simple
discipline
for
their
souls
i
dislike
the
interference
of
genteel
notions
in
our
studies
for
another
reason
they
deprive
such
culture
as
we
may
get
from
them
of
one
of
the
most
precious
results
of
culture
the
enlargement
of
our
sympathy
for
others
if
we
encourage
ourselves
in
the
pride
of
scholarly
caste
so
far
as
to
imagine
that
we
who
have
made
latin
verses
are
above
comparison
with
all
who
have
never
exercised
their
ingenuity
in
that
particular
way
we
are
not
likely
to
give
due
and
serious
attention
to
the
ideas
of
people
whom
we
are
pleased
to
consider
uneducated
and
yet
it
may
happen
that
these
people
are
sometimes
our
intellectual
superiors
and
that
their
ideas
concern
us
very
closely
but
this
is
only
half
the
evil
the
consciousness
of
our
contempt
embitters
the
feelings
of
men
in
other
castes
and
prevents
them
from
accepting
our
guidance
when
it
might
be
of
the
greatest
practical
utility
to
them
i
may
mention
robert
burns
as
an
instance
of
a
man
of
genius
who
would
have
been
happier
and
more
fortunate
if
he
had
felt
no
barrier
of
separation
between
himself
and
the
culture
of
his
time
his
poetry
is
as
good
rustic
poetry
as
the
best
that
has
come
down
to
us
from
antiquity
and
instead
of
feeling
towards
the
poets
of
times
past
the
kind
of
soreness
which
a
parvenu
feels
towards
families
of
ancient
descent
he
ought
rather
to
have
rejoiced
in
the
consciousness
that
he
was
their
true
and
legitimate
successor
as
the
clergy
of
an
authentic
church
feel
themselves
to
be
successors
and
representatives
of
saints
and
apostles
who
are
gathered
to
their
everlasting
rest
but
poor
burns
knew
that
in
an
age
when
what
is
called
scholarship
gave
all
who
had
acquired
it
a
right
to
look
down
upon
poets
who
had
only
genius
as
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
nature
his
position
had
not
that
solidity
which
belonged
to
the
scholarly
caste
and
the
result
was
a
perpetual
uneasiness
which
broke
out
in
frequent
defiance
there
ither
poets
much
your
betters
far
seen
in
greek
deep
men
o
letters
hae
thought
they
had
ensur
their
debtors
a
future
ages
moths
deform
in
shapeless
tatters
their
unknown
and
again
in
another
poem
a
set
o
dull
conceited
hashes
confuse
their
brains
in
college
classes
gang
in
stirks
and
come
out
asses
plain
truth
to
speak
an
syne
they
think
to
climb
parnassus
by
dint
o
greek
it
was
the
influence
of
caste
that
made
burns
write
in
this
way
and
how
unjust
it
was
every
modern
reader
knows
the
great
majority
of
poets
have
been
men
and
instead
of
ganging
into
college
like
stirks
and
coming
out
like
asses
they
have
as
a
rule
improved
their
poetic
faculty
by
an
acquaintance
with
the
masterpieces
of
their
art
yet
burns
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
this
injustice
he
sneered
at
greek
because
greek
was
the
mark
of
a
disdainful
and
exclusive
caste
but
he
never
sneered
at
french
or
italian
he
had
no
soreness
against
culture
for
its
own
sake
it
was
the
pride
of
caste
that
galled
him
how
surely
the
wonderful
guided
the
aristocracy
to
the
kind
of
learning
likely
to
be
the
most
effectual
barrier
against
fellowship
with
the
mercantile
classes
and
the
people
the
uselessness
of
greek
in
industry
and
commerce
was
a
guarantee
that
those
who
had
to
earn
their
bread
would
never
find
time
to
master
it
and
even
the
strange
difficult
look
of
the
alphabet
though
in
reality
the
alphabet
was
a
gate
of
gossamer
ensured
a
degree
of
awful
veneration
for
those
initiated
into
its
mysteries
then
the
habit
our
forefathers
had
of
quoting
latin
and
greek
to
keep
the
ignorant
in
their
places
was
a
strong
defensive
weapon
of
their
caste
and
they
used
it
without
scruple
every
year
removes
this
passion
for
exclusiveness
farther
and
farther
into
the
past
every
year
makes
learning
of
every
kind
less
available
as
the
armor
of
a
class
and
less
to
be
relied
upon
as
a
means
of
social
advancement
and
consideration
indeed
we
have
already
reached
a
condition
which
is
drawing
back
many
members
of
the
aristocracy
to
a
state
of
feeling
about
intellectual
culture
resembling
that
of
their
forefathers
in
the
middle
ages
the
old
barbarian
feeling
has
revived
of
late
a
feeling
which
if
it
were
enough
might
find
expression
in
some
such
words
as
these
it
is
not
by
learning
and
genius
that
we
can
hold
the
highest
place
but
by
the
dazzling
exhibition
of
external
splendor
in
those
costly
pleasures
which
are
the
plainest
evidence
of
our
power
let
us
have
beautiful
equipages
on
the
land
beautiful
yachts
upon
the
sea
let
our
recreations
be
public
and
expensive
that
the
people
may
not
easily
lose
sight
of
us
and
may
know
that
there
is
a
gulf
of
difference
between
our
life
and
theirs
why
should
we
toil
at
books
that
the
poorest
students
read
we
who
have
lordly
pastimes
for
every
month
in
the
year
to
be
able
to
revel
immensely
in
pleasures
which
those
below
us
taste
rarely
or
not
at
all
this
is
the
best
evidence
of
our
superiority
so
let
us
take
them
magnificently
like
english
princes
and
lords
even
the
invention
of
railways
has
produced
the
unforeseen
result
of
a
return
in
the
direction
of
barbarism
if
there
is
one
thing
which
distinguishes
civilization
it
is
fixity
of
residence
and
it
is
essential
to
the
tranquil
following
of
serious
intellectual
purposes
that
the
student
should
remain
for
many
months
of
the
year
in
his
own
library
or
laboratory
surrounded
by
all
his
implements
of
culture
but
there
are
people
of
the
highest
rank
in
the
england
of
whose
existence
is
as
much
nomadic
as
that
of
red
indians
in
the
reserved
territories
of
north
america
you
can
not
ascertain
their
whereabouts
without
consulting
the
most
recent
newspaper
their
life
may
be
quite
accurately
described
as
a
return
on
a
scale
of
unprecedented
splendor
and
comfort
to
the
life
of
tribes
in
that
stage
of
human
development
which
is
known
as
the
period
of
the
chase
they
migrate
from
one
to
another
as
the
diminution
of
the
game
impels
them
their
residences
vast
and
substantial
as
they
are
serve
only
as
tents
and
wigwams
the
existence
of
a
monk
in
the
cloister
of
a
prisoner
in
a
fortress
is
more
favorable
to
the
intellect
than
theirs
and
yet
notwithstanding
these
of
the
savage
nature
at
the
very
summit
of
modern
civilization
the
life
of
a
great
english
nobleman
of
commands
so
much
of
what
the
intellectual
know
to
be
truly
desirable
that
it
seems
as
if
only
a
little
firmness
of
resolution
were
needed
to
make
all
advantages
his
own
surrounded
by
every
aid
and
having
all
gates
open
he
sees
the
paths
of
knowledge
converging
towards
him
like
railways
to
some
rich
central
city
he
has
but
to
choose
his
route
and
travel
along
it
with
the
least
possible
hindrance
from
every
kind
of
friction
in
the
society
of
the
best
companions
and
served
by
the
most
perfectly
trained
attendants
might
not
our
lords
be
like
those
brilliant
peers
who
shone
like
intellectual
stars
around
the
throne
of
elizabeth
and
our
ladies
like
that
great
lady

much
of
persons
and

that
we
ought
to
forget
persons
and
apply
our
minds
to
things
and
phenomena
and
ideas
all
you
say
against
the
narrowness
of
the
aristocratic
spirit
is
true
and
to
the
point
but
i
think
that
you
and
your
party
are
apt
to
confound
together
two
states
of
feeling
which
are
essentially
distinct
from
each
other
there
is
an
illiberal
spirit
of
aristocracy
and
there
is
also
a
liberal
one
the
illiberal
spirit
does
not
desire
to
improve
itself
having
a
full
and
firm
belief
in
its
own
absolute
perfection
its
sole
anxiety
is
to
exclude
others
to
draw
a
circular
line
the
smaller
the
better
provided
always
that
it
gets
inside
and
can
keep
the
millions
out
we
see
this
spirit
not
only
in
reference
to
birth
but
in
even
fuller
activity
with
regard
to
education
and
employment
in
the
preference
for
certain
schools
and
colleges
for
class
reasons
without
regard
to
the
quality
of
the
teaching
in
the
contempt
for
all
professions
but
two
or
three
without
regard
to
the
inherent
baseness
or
nobility
of
the
work
that
has
to
be
done
in
them
so
that
the
question
asked
by
persons
of
this
temper
is
not
whether
a
man
has
been
well
trained
in
his
youth
but
if
he
has
been
to
eton
and
oxford
not
whether
he
is
honorably
laborious
in
his
manhood
but
whether
he
belongs
to
the
bar
or
the
army
or
the
church
this
spirit
is
evil
in
its
influence
because
it
substitutes
external
limitations
for
the
realities
of
the
intellect
and
the
soul
and
makes
those
realities
themselves
of
no
account
wherever
its
traditions
prevail
this
spirit
cares
nothing
for
culture
nothing
for
excellence
nothing
for
the
superiorities
that
make
men
truly
great
all
it
cares
for
is
to
have
reserved
seats
in
the
great
assemblage
of
the
world
whatever
you
do
in
fairness
and
honesty
against
this
evil
and
inhuman
spirit
of
aristocracy
the
best
minds
of
this
age
approve
but
there
is
another
spirit
of
aristocracy
which
does
not
always
receive
the
fairest
treatment
at
your
hands
and
which
ought
to
be
resolutely
defended
against
you
there
is
really
in
nature
such
a
thing
as
high
life
there
is
really
in
nature
a
difference
between
the
life
of
a
gentleman
who
has
culture
and
fine
bodily
health
and
independence
and
the
life
of
a
sheffield
who
can
not
have
any
one
of
these
three
things
it
is
a
good
and
not
a
bad
sign
of
the
state
of
popular
intelligence
when
the
people
does
not
wilfully
shut
its
eyes
to
the
differences
of
condition
amongst
men
and
when
those
who
have
the
opportunity
of
leading
what
is
truly
the
high
life
accept
its
discipline
joyfully
and
have
a
just
pride
in
keeping
themselves
up
to
their
ideal
a
life
of
health
of
sound
morality
of
disinterested
intellectual
activity
of
freedom
from
petty
cares
higher
than
a
life
of
disease
and
vice
and
stupidity
and
sordid
anxiety
i
maintain
that
it
is
right
and
wise
in
a
nation
to
set
before
itself
the
highest
attainable
ideal
of
human
life
as
the
existence
of
the
complete
gentleman
and
that
an
envious
democracy
instead
of
rendering
a
service
to
itself
does
exactly
the
contrary
when
it
can
not
endure
and
will
not
tolerate
the
presence
of
gentlemen
in
the
state
there
are
things
in
this
world
that
it
is
right
to
hate
that
we
are
the
better
for
hating
with
all
our
hearts
and
one
of
the
things
that
i
hate
most
and
with
most
reason
is
the
narrow
when
it
sets
itself
against
the
great
interests
of
mankind
it
is
odious
in
the
pompous
selfish
pitiless
aristocrat
who
thinks
that
the
sons
of
the
people
were
made
by
almighty
god
to
be
his
lackeys
and
their
daughters
to
be
his
mistresses
it
is
odious
also
to
the
full
as
odious
in
the
envious
democrat
who
can
not
bear
to
see
any
elegance
of
living
or
grace
of
manner
or
culture
of
mind
above
the
range
of
his
own
capacity
or
his
own
purse
let
me
recommend
to
your
consideration
the
following
words
written
by
one
young
nobleman
about
another
young
nobleman
and
reminding
us
as
we
much
need
to
be
reminded
that
life
may
be
not
only
honest
and
vigorous
but
also
noble
and
beautiful
robert
lytton
says
of
julian
fane
he
was
i
think
the
most
graceful
and
accomplished
gentleman
of
the
generation
he
adorned
and
by
this
generation
at
least
appropriate
place
should
be
reserved
for
the
memory
of
a
man
in
whose
character
the
most
universal
sympathy
with
all
the
intellectual
culture
of
his
age
was
united
to
a
refinement
of
social
form
and
a
perfection
of
personal
grace
which
in
spite
of
all
its
intellectual
culture
the
age
is
sadly
in
want
of
there
is
an
artistry
of
life
as
well
as
of
literature
and
the
perfect
knighthood
of
sidney
is
no
less
precious
to
the
world
than
the
genius
of
spenser
it
is
just
this
perfect
knighthood
that
an
envious
democracy
sneers
at
and
puts
down
i
do
not
say
that
all
democracies
are
necessarily
envious
but
they
often
are
so
especially
when
they
first
assert
themselves
and
whilst
in
that
temper
they
are
very
willing
to
ostracize
gentlemen
or
compel
them
to
adopt
bad
manners
i
have
some
hopes
that
the
democracies
of
the
future
may
be
taught
by
authors
and
artists
to
appreciate
natural
gentlemanhood
but
so
far
as
we
know
them
hitherto
they
seem
intolerant
of
dignity
and
disposed
to
attribute
it
very
unjustly
to
individual
the
personages
most
popular
in
democratic
countries
are
often
remarkably
deficient
in
dignity
and
liked
the
better
for
the
want
of
it
whilst
if
on
the
positive
side
they
can
display
occasional
coarseness
they
become
more
popular
still
then
i
should
say
that
although
democratic
feeling
raises
the
lower
classes
and
increases
their
which
is
indeed
one
of
the
greatest
imaginable
benefits
to
a
nation
it
has
a
tendency
to
fix
one
uniform
type
of
behavior
and
of
thought
as
the
sole
type
in
conformity
with
what
is
accepted
for
common
sense
and
that
type
can
scarcely
in
the
nature
of
things
be
a
very
elevated
one
i
have
been
much
struck
in
france
by
the
prevalence
of
what
may
be
not
inaccurately
defined
as
the
commercial
traveller
type
even
in
classes
where
you
would
scarcely
expect
to
meet
with
it
one
little
descriptive
anecdote
will
illustrate
what
i
mean
having
been
invited
to
a
in
the
côte
i
sat
down
to
with
the
sportsmen
in
a
good
or
château
it
was
an
old
place
with
four
towers
and
in
the
midst
of
the
meal
in
came
a
man
smoking
a
cigar
after
a
bow
to
the
ladies
he
declined
to
eat
anything
and
took
a
chair
a
little
apart
but
just
opposite
me
he
resumed
his
hat
and
went
on
smoking
with
a
that
rather
surprised
me
under
the
circumstances
he
put
one
arm
on
the
the
hand
hung
down
and
i
perceived
that
it
was
dirty
so
was
the
shirt
and
that
the
nails
had
edges
of
ebony
on
his
chin
there
was
a
black
stubble
of
two
days
growth
he
talked
very
loudly
and
his
dress
and
manners
were
exactly
those
of
a
bagman
just
arrived
at
his
inn
who
and
what
could
the
man
be
i
learned
afterwards
that
he
had
begun
life
as
a
distinguished
pupil
of
the
that
since
then
he
had
distinguished
himself
as
an
officer
of
artillery
and
had
won
the
legion
of
honor
on
the
field
of
battle
that
he
belonged
to
one
of
the
principal
families
in
the
neighborhood
and
had
nearly
a
year
from
landed
property
now
it
may
be
a
good
thing
for
the
roughs
at
the
bottom
of
the
social
scale
to
level
up
to
the
but
it
does
seem
rather
a
pity
does
it
not
that
a
born
gentleman
of
more
than
common
bravery
and
ability
should
level
to
it
and
it
is
here
that
lies
the
principle
objection
to
democracy
from
the
point
of
view
of
culture
that
its
notion
of
life
and
manners
is
a
uniform
notion
not
admitting
much
variety
of
classes
and
not
allowing
the
high
development
of
graceful
and
accomplished
humanity
in
any
class
which
an
aristocracy
does
at
least
encourage
in
one
class
though
it
may
be
numerically
a
small
class
i
have
not
forgotten
what
and
la
bruyère
have
testified
about
the
ignorance
of
the
old
noblesse
said
that
they
were
fit
for
nothing
but
fighting
and
only
qualified
for
promotion
even
in
the
army
by
seniority
that
the
rest
of
their
time
was
passed
in
the
most
deadly
uselessness
the
consequence
of
their
indolence
and
distaste
for
all
instruction
i
am
sure
that
my
modern
artillery
captain
notwithstanding
his
bad
manners
more
than
any
of
his
forefathers
but
where
was
his
perfect
knighthood
and
we
easily
forget
how
much
talent
runs
into
manners
as
emerson
says
from
the
artistic
and
poetical
point
of
view
behavior
is
an
expression
of
knowledge
and
taste
and
feeling
in
combination
as
clear
and
legible
as
literature
or
painting
so
that
when
the
behavior
is
coarse
and
unbecoming
we
know
that
the
perceptions
can
not
be
delicate
whatever
may
have
been
learned
at
school
when
arnold
travelled
on
the
continent
nothing
struck
him
more
than
the
absence
of
gentlemen
we
see
no
gentlemen
anywhere
he
writes
from
italy
from
france
he
writes
again
i
have
been
struck
with
the
total
absence
of
all
gentlemen
and
of
all
persons
of
the
education
and
feelings
of
gentlemen
now
although
arnold
spoke
merely
from
the
experience
of
a
tourist
and
was
perhaps
not
quite
competent
to
judge
of
frenchmen
and
italians
otherwise
than
from
externals
still
there
was
much
truth
in
his
observation
it
was
not
quite
absolutely
true
i
have
known
two
or
three
italian
officers
and
one
savoyard
nobleman
and
a
frenchman
here
and
there
who
were
as
perfect
gentlemen
as
any
to
be
found
in
england
but
they
were
isolated
like
poets
and
were
in
fact
poets
in
behavior
and
self
discipline
the
plain
truth
is
that
there
is
no
distinct
class
in
france
maintaining
good
manners
as
a
tradition
common
to
all
its
members
and
this
seems
to
be
the
inevitable
defect
of
a
democracy
it
may
be
observed
further
that
language
itself
is
defiled
by
the
vulgarity
of
the
popular
taste
that
expressions
are
used
continually
even
by
the
upper
middle
class
which
it
is
impossible
to
print
and
which
are
too
grossly
indecent
to
find
a
place
even
in
the
dictionaries
that
respectable
men
having
become
insensible
to
the
meaning
of
these
expressions
from
hearing
them
used
without
intention
employ
them
constantly
from
habit
as
they
decorate
their
speech
with
oaths
whilst
only
purists
refrain
from
them
altogether
an
aristocracy
may
be
very
narrow
and
intolerant
but
it
can
only
exclude
from
its
own
pale
whereas
when
a
democracy
is
intolerant
it
excludes
from
all
human
intercourse
our
own
aristocracy
as
a
class
rejects
dissenters
and
artists
and
men
of
science
but
they
flourish
quite
happily
outside
of
it
now
try
to
picture
to
yourself
a
great
democracy
having
the
same
prejudices
who
could
get
out
of
the
democracy
all
aristocracies
are
intolerant
with
reference
i
will
not
say
to
religion
but
more
accurately
with
reference
to
the
outward
forms
of
religion
and
yet
this
aristocratic
intolerance
has
not
prevented
the
development
of
religious
liberty
because
the
lower
classes
were
not
strictly
bound
by
the
customs
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
the
unwritten
law
appears
to
be
that
members
of
an
aristocracy
shall
conform
either
to
what
is
actually
the
state
church
or
to
what
has
been
the
state
church
at
some
former
period
of
the
national
history
although
england
is
a
protestant
country
an
english
gentleman
does
not
lose
caste
when
he
joins
the
roman
catholic
communion
but
he
loses
caste
when
he
becomes
a
dissenter
the
influence
of
this
in
keeping
the
upper
classes
within
the
churches
of
england
and
of
rome
has
no
doubt
been
very
considerable
but
its
influence
on
the
nation
generally
has
been
incomparably
less
considerable
than
that
of
some
equally
decided
social
rule
in
the
entire
mind
of
a
democracy
had
this
rule
of
conformity
to
the
religion
of
the
state
been
that
of
the
english
democracy
religious
liberty
would
have
been
extinguished
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
england
i
say
that
the
customs
and
convictions
of
a
democracy
are
more
dangerous
to
intellectual
liberty
than
those
of
an
aristocracy
because
in
matters
of
custom
the
gentry
rule
only
within
their
own
whereas
the
people
when
power
resides
with
them
rule
wherever
the
breezes
blow
a
democracy
that
dislikes
refinement
and
good
manners
can
drive
men
of
culture
into
solitude
and
make
morbid
hermits
of
the
very
persons
who
ought
to
be
the
lights
and
leaders
of
humanity
it
can
cut
short
the
traditions
of
the
traditions
of
polite
learning
the
traditions
of
thoughtful
leisure
and
reduce
the
various
national
types
of
character
to
one
type
that
of
the
all
men
of
refined
sentiment
in
modern
france
lament
the
want
of
elevation
in
the
they
read
nothing
they
learn
nothing
they
think
of
nothing
but
money
and
the
satisfaction
of
their
appetites
there
are
exceptions
of
course
but
the
tone
of
the
class
is
mean
and
low
and
devoid
of
natural
dignity
or
noble
aspiration
their
ignorance
passes
belief
and
is
accompanied
by
an
absolute
la
fin
de
la
bourgeoisie

and

thrown

foolishly
such
is
the
provincial
spirit
and
if
this
is
the
provincial
spirit
what
is
the
spirit
of
the
metropolitan
democracy
is
it
not
clearly
known
to
us
by
its
acts
it
had
the
opportunity
under
the
commune
of
showing
the
world
how
tenderly
it
cared
for
the
monuments
of
national
history
how
anxious
it
was
for
the
preservation
of
noble
architecture
of
great
libraries
of
pictures
that
can
never
be
replaced
whatever
may
have
been
our
illusions
about
the
character
of
the
parisian
democracy
we
know
it
very
accurately
now
to
say
that
it
is
brutal
would
be
an
inadequate
use
of
language
for
the
brutes
are
only
indifferent
to
history
and
civilization
not
hostile
to
them
so
far
as
it
is
possible
for
us
to
understand
the
temper
of
that
democracy
it
appears
to
cherish
an
active
and
intense
hatred
for
every
conceivable
kind
of
superiority
and
an
instinctive
eagerness
to
abolish
the
past
or
as
that
is
not
possible
since
the
past
will
always
in
spite
of
it
then
at
least
to
efface
all
visible
memorials
and
destroy
the
bequests
of
all
preceding
generations
if
any
one
had
affirmed
before
the
fall
of
louis
napoleon
that
the
democratic
spirit
was
capable
of
setting
fire
to
the
louvre
and
the
national
archives
and
libraries
of
deliberately
planning
the
destruction
of
all
those
magnificent
edifices
ecclesiastical
and
civil
which
were
the
glory
of
france
and
the
delight
of
europe
we
should
have
attributed
such
an
assertion
to
the
exaggerations
of
reactionary
fears
but
since
the
year
we
do
not
speculate
about
the
democratic
temper
in
its
intensest
expression
we
have
seen
it
at
work
and
we
know
it
we
know
that
every
beautiful
building
every
precious
manuscript
and
picture
has
to
be
protected
against
the
noxious
swarm
of
communards
as
a
against
the
pholas
and
the
teredo
compare
this
temper
with
that
of
a
marquis
of
hertford
a
duke
of
devonshire
a
duc
de
luynes
true
guardians
of
the
means
of
culture
these
men
have
given
splendid
hospitality
to
the
great
authors
and
artists
of
past
times
by
keeping
their
works
for
the
future
with
tender
and
reverent
care
nor
has
this
function
of
high
stewardship
ever
been
more
nobly
exercised
than
it
is
by
that
true
knight
and
gentleman
sir
richard
wallace
think
of
the
difference
between
this
guardian
of
priceless
treasures
keeping
them
for
the
people
for
civilization
and
a
communard
setting
fire
to
the
library
of
the
louvre
the
spirit
is
hostile
to
culture
from
its
hatred
of
all
delicate
and
romantic
sentiment
from
its
scorn
of
the
tenderer
and
finer
feelings
of
our
nature
and
especially
from
its
brutish
incapacity
to
comprehend
the
needs
of
the
higher
life
if
it
had
its
way
we
should
be
compelled
by
public
opinion
to
cast
all
the
records
of
our
ancestors
and
the
shields
they
wore
in
battle
into
the
foul
waters
of
an
eternal
lethe
the
intolerance
of
the
sentiment
of
birth
that
noble
sentiment
which
has
animated
so
many
hearts
with
heroism
and
urged
them
to
deeds
of
honor
associated
as
it
is
with
a
cynical
disbelief
in
the
existence
of
female
virtue
is
one
of
the
commonest
signs
of
this
evil
spirit
of
detraction
it
is
closely
connected
with
an
ungrateful
indifference
towards
all
that
our
forefathers
have
done
to
make
civilization
possible
for
us
now
although
the
intellectual
spirit
studies
the
past
critically
and
does
not
accept
history
as
a
legend
is
accepted
by
the
credulous
still
the
intellectual
spirit
has
a
deep
respect
for
all
that
is
noble
in
the
past
and
would
preserve
the
record
of
it
forever
can
you
not
imagine
have
you
not
actually
seen
the
heir
of
some
ancient
house
who
shares
to
the
full
the
culture
and
aspirations
of
the
age
in
which
we
live
and
who
nevertheless
preserves
with
pious
reverence
the
towers
his
forefathers
built
on
the
ancestral
earth
and
the
oaks
they
planted
and
the
shields
that
were
carved
on
the
tombs
where
the
knights
and
their
ladies
rest
be
sure
that
a
right
understanding
of
the
present
is
compatible
with
a
right
and
reverent
understanding
of
the
past
and
that
although
we
may
closely
question
history
and
tradition
no
longer
with
childlike
faith
still
the
spirit
of
true
culture
would
never
efface
their
vestiges
it
was
not
michelet
not
renan
not
hugo
who
set
fire
to
the
palace
of
justice
and
imperilled
the
and
yet
notwithstanding
all
these
vices
and
excesses
of
the
democratic
spirit
notwithstanding
the
meanness
of
the
middle
classes
and
the
violence
of
the
mob
there
is
one
reason
why
our
best
hopes
for
the
liberal
culture
of
the
intellect
are
centred
in
the
democratic
idea
the
reason
is
that
aristocracies
think
too
much
of
persons
and
positions
to
weigh
facts
and
opinions
justly
in
an
aristocratic
society
it
is
thought
unbecoming
to
state
your
views
in
their
full
force
in
the
presence
of
any
social
superior
if
you
state
them
at
all
you
must
soften
them
to
suit
the
occasion
or
you
will
be
a
sinner
against
observe
how
timid
and
acquiescent
the
ordinary
englishman
becomes
in
the
presence
of
a
lord
no
person
likes
to
be
thought
impudent
and
where
the
tone
of
society
refers
everything
to
position
you
are
considered
impudent
when
you
forget
your
station
but
what
has
my
station
to
do
with
the
truths
the
intellect
perceives
that
lie
entirely
outside
of
me
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
it
is
a
necessary
virtue
to
forget
your
station
to
forget
yourself
entirely
and
to
think
of
the
subject
only
in
a
manner
perfectly
disinterested
anonymous
journalism
was
a
device
to
escape
from
that
continual
reference
to
the
rank
and
fortune
of
the
speaker
which
is
an
inveterate
habit
in
all
aristocratic
communities
a
young
man
without
title
or
estate
knows
that
he
would
not
be
listened
to
in
the
presence
of
his
social
superiors
so
he
holds
his
tongue
in
society
and
relieves
himself
by
an
article
in
the
the
anonymous
newspapers
and
reviews
are
a
necessity
in
an
aristocratic
community
for
they
are
the
only
means
of
attracting
attention
to
facts
and
opinions
without
attracting
it
to
yourself
the
only
way
of
escaping
the
personal
question
who
and
what
are
you
that
you
venture
to
speak
so
plainly
and
where
is
your
stake
in
the
country
the
democratic
idea
by
its
theoretic
equality
amongst
men
affords
an
almost
complete
relief
from
this
impediment
to
intellectual
conversation
the
theory
of
equality
is
good
because
it
negatives
the
interference
of
rank
and
wealth
in
matters
that
appertain
to
the
intellect
or
to
the
moral
sense
it
may
even
go
one
step
farther
with
advantage
and
ignore
intellectual
authority
also
the
perfection
of
the
intellectual
spirit
is
the
entire
forgetfulness
of
persons
in
the
application
of
the
whole
power
of
the
mind
to
things
and
phenomena
and
ideas
not
to
mind
whether
the
speaker
is
of
noble
or
humble
birth
rich
or
poor
this
indeed
is
much
but
we
ought
to
attain
a
like
indifference
to
the
authority
of
the
most
splendid
reputation
every
great
advance
in
natural
knowledge
says
professor
huxley
has
involved
the
absolute
rejection
of
authority
the
cherishing
of
the
keenest
scepticism
the
annihilation
of
the
spirit
of
blind
faith
and
the
most
ardent
votary
of
science
holds
his
firmest
convictions
not
because
the
men
he
most
venerates
hold
them
not
because
their
verity
is
testified
by
portents
and
wonders
but
because
his
experience
teaches
him
that
whenever
he
chooses
to
bring
these
convictions
into
contact
with
their
primary
source
nature
whenever
he
thinks
fit
to
test
them
by
appealing
to
experiment
and
to
observation
nature
will
confirm
them
footnotes
i
think
it
right
to
inform
the
reader
that
there
is
no
fiction
in
this
letter
the
association
between
the
two
is
this
if
you
believe
that
you
are
descended
from
a
distinguished
ancestor
you
are
simple
enough
to
believe
in
his

part

and
letter
i
to
a
lady
who
doubted
the
reality
of
intellectual
friendships
that
intellectual
friendships
are
in
their
nature

when
there
is
no
basis
of
feeling
to
support
them
their
freshness
soon
disappears

and

tradition
transmitted
through
these
friendships
i
heartily
agree
with
you
so
far
as
this
that
intellectual
relations
will
not
sustain
friendship
for
very
long
unless
there
is
also
some
basis
of
feeling
to
sustain
it
and
still
there
is
a
certain
reality
in
the
friendships
of
the
intellect
whilst
they
last
and
they
are
remembered
gratefully
for
their
profit
when
in
the
course
of
nature
they
have
ceased
we
may
wisely
contract
them
and
blamelessly
dissolve
them
when
the
occasion
that
created
them
has
gone
by
they
are
like
business
partnerships
contracted
from
motives
of
interest
and
requiring
integrity
above
all
things
with
mutual
respect
and
consideration
yet
not
necessarily
either
affection
or
the
semblance
of
it
since
the
motive
of
the
intellectual
existence
is
the
desire
to
ascertain
and
communicate
truth
a
sort
of
positive
and
negative
electricity
immediately
establishes
itself
between
those
who
want
to
know
and
those
who
desire
to
communicate
their
knowledge
and
the
connection
is
mutually
agreeable
until
these
two
desires
are
satisfied
when
this
happens
the
connection
naturally
ceases
but
the
memory
of
it
usually
leaves
a
permanent
feeling
of
and
a
permanent
disposition
to
render
services
of
the
same
order
this
in
brief
is
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
subject
but
it
may
be
observed
farther
that
the
purely
intellectual
intercourse
which
often
goes
by
the
name
of
friendship
affords
excellent
opportunities
for
the
formation
of
real
friendship
since
it
can
not
be
long
continued
without
revealing
much
of
the
whole
nature
of
the
associates
we
do
not
easily
exhaust
the
mind
of
another
but
we
easily
exhaust
what
is
accessible
to
us
in
his
mind
and
when
we
have
done
this
the
first
benefit
of
intercourse
is
at
an
end
then
comes
a
feeling
of
dulness
and
disappointment
which
is
full
of
the
bitterest
discouragement
to
the
inexperienced
in
maturer
life
we
are
so
well
prepared
for
this
that
it
discourages
us
no
longer
we
know
beforehand
that
the
freshness
of
the
mind
that
was
new
to
us
will
rapidly
wear
away
that
we
shall
soon
assimilate
the
fragment
of
it
which
is
all
that
ever
can
be
made
our
own
so
we
enjoy
the
freshness
whilst
it
lasts
and
are
even
careful
of
it
as
a
fruiterer
is
of
the
bloom
upon
his
grapes
and
plums
it
may
seem
a
hard
and
worldly
thing
to
say
but
it
appears
to
me
that
a
wise
man
might
limit
his
intercourse
with
others
before
there
was
any
danger
of
satiety
as
it
is
wisdom
in
eating
to
rise
from
table
with
an
appetite
certainly
if
the
friends
of
our
intellect
live
near
enough
for
us
to
anticipate
no
permanent
separation
by
mere
distance
if
we
may
expect
to
meet
them
frequently
to
have
many
opportunities
for
a
more
thorough
and
searching
exploration
of
their
minds
it
is
a
wise
policy
not
to
exhaust
them
all
at
once
with
the
chance
acquaintances
we
make
in
travelling
the
case
is
altogether
different
and
this
is
no
doubt
the
reason
why
men
are
so
astonishingly
communicative
when
they
never
expect
to
see
each
other
any
more
you
feel
an
intense
curiosity
about
some
temporary
companion
you
make
many
guesses
about
him
and
to
induce
him
to
tell
you
as
much
as
possible
in
the
short
time
you
are
likely
to
be
together
you
win
his
confidence
by
a
frankness
that
would
perhaps
considerably
surprise
your
nearest
neighbors
and
relations
this
is
due
to
the
shortness
of
the
opportunity
but
with
people
who
live
in
the
same
place
you
will
proceed
much
more
deliberately
whoever
would
remain
regularly
provided
with
intellectual
friends
ought
to
arrange
a
succession
of
friendships
as
gardeners
do
with
peas
and
strawberries
so
that
whilst
some
are
fully
ripe
others
should
be
ripening
to
replace
them
this
doctrine
sounds
like
blasphemy
against
friendship
but
it
is
not
intended
to
apply
to
the
sacred
friendship
of
the
heart
which
ought
to
be
permanent
like
marriage
only
to
the
friendship
of
the
head
which
is
of
the
utmost
utility
to
culture
yet
in
its
nature
temporary
i
know
a
distinguished
englishman
who
is
quite
remarkable
for
the
talent
with
which
he
arranges
his
intellectual
friendships
so
as
never
to
be
dependent
on
any
one
but
always
sure
of
the
intercourse
he
needs
both
now
and
in
the
future
he
will
never
be
isolated
never
without
some
fresh
and
living
interest
in
humanity
it
may
seem
to
you
that
there
is
a
lamentable
want
of
faith
in
this
and
i
grant
at
once
that
a
system
of
this
kind
does
presuppose
the
extinction
of
the
boyish
belief
in
the
permanence
of
human
relations
still
it
indicates
a
confidence
in
the
value
of
human
intercourse
an
enjoyment
of
the
present
a
hope
for
the
future
and
a
right
appreciation
of
the
past
nothing
is
more
beautiful
in
the
intellectual
life
than
the
willingness
of
all
cultivated
people
unless
they
happen
to
be
accidentally
soured
by
circumstances
that
have
made
them
wretched
to
communicate
to
others
the
results
of
all
their
toil
it
is
true
that
they
apparently
lose
nothing
by
the
process
and
that
a
rich
man
who
gives
some
portion
of
his
material
wealth
exercises
a
greater
still
when
you
consider
that
men
of
culture
in
teaching
others
abandon
something
of
their
relative
superiority
and
often
voluntarily
incur
the
sacrifice
of
what
is
most
precious
to
them
namely
their
time
i
think
you
will
admit
that
their
readiness
in
this
kind
of
generosity
is
one
of
the
finest
characteristics
of
humanity
of
all
intellectual
friendships
none
are
so
beautiful
as
those
which
subsist
between
old
and
ripe
men
and
their
younger
brethren
in
science
or
literature
or
art
it
is
by
these
private
friendships
even
more
than
by
public
performance
that
the
tradition
of
sound
thinking
and
great
doing
is
perpetuated
from
age
to
age
hoogstraten
who
was
a
pupil
of
rembrandt
asked
him
many
questions
which
the
great
master
answered
thus
try
to
put
well
in
practice
what
you
already
know
in
so
doing
you
will
in
good
time
discover
the
hidden
things
which
you
now
inquire
about
that
answer
of
rembrandt
is
typical
of
the
maturest
teaching
how
truly
friendly
it
is
how
full
of
encouragement
how
kind
in
its
admission
that
the
younger
artist
already
know
something
worth
putting
into
practice
and
yet
at
the
same
time
how
judicious
in
its
reserve
few
of
us
have
been
so
exceptionally
unfortunate
as
not
to
find
in
our
own
age
some
experienced
friend
who
has
helped
us
by
precious
counsel
never
to
be
forgotten
we
can
not
render
it
in
kind
but
perhaps
in
the
fulness
of
time
it
may
become
our
noblest
duty
to
aid
another
as
we
have
ourselves
been
aided
and
to
transmit
to
him
an
invaluable
treasure
the
tradition
of
the
intellectual
life
letter
ii
to
a
young
gentleman
who
lived
much
in
fashionable
society
certain
dangers
to
the
intellectual
life
difficult
to
resist
the
influences
of
society
gilding
fashionable
education
affectations
of
knowledge
not
easy
to
ascertain
what
people
really
know
value
of
real
knowledge
diminished
some
good
effects
of
affectations
their
bad
effect
on
workers
skill
in
amusements
the
kind
of
life
which
you
have
been
leading
for
the
last
three
or
four
years
will
always
be
valuable
to
you
as
a
past
experience
but
if
the
intellectual
ambition
you
confess
to
me
is
quite
serious
i
would
venture
to
suggest
that
there
are
certain
dangers
in
the
continuation
of
your
present
existence
if
altogether
uninterrupted
pray
do
not
suspect
me
of
any
narrow
prejudice
against
human
intercourse
or
of
any
wish
to
make
a
hermit
of
you
before
your
time
but
believe
that
the
few
observations
i
have
to
make
are
grounded
simply
on
the
desire
that
your
career
should
be
entirely
satisfactory
to
your
own
maturer
judgment
when
you
will
look
back
upon
it
after
many
years
an
intellectual
man
may
go
into
general
society
quite
safely
if
only
he
can
resist
its
influence
upon
his
serious
work
but
such
resistance
is
difficult
in
maturity
and
impossible
in
youth
the
sort
of
influence
most
to
be
dreaded
is
this
society
is
and
must
be
based
upon
appearances
and
not
upon
the
deepest
realities
it
requires
some
degree
of
reality
to
produce
the
appearance
but
not
a
substantial
reality
gilding
is
the
perfect
type
of
what
society
requires
a
certain
quantity
of
gold
is
necessary
for
the
work
of
the
gilder
but
a
very
small
quantity
and
skill
in
applying
the
metal
so
as
to
cover
a
large
surface
is
of
greater
consequence
than
the
weight
of
the
metal
itself
the
mind
of
a
fashionable
person
is
a
carefully
gilded
mind
consider
fashionable
education
society
imperatively
requires
an
outside
knowledge
of
many
things
not
permitting
the
frank
confession
of
ignorance
whilst
it
is
yet
satisfied
with
a
degree
of
knowledge
differing
only
from
avowed
ignorance
in
permitting
you
to
be
less
sincere
all
young
ladies
whether
gifted
by
nature
with
any
musical
talent
or
not
are
compelled
to
say
that
they
have
learned
to
play
upon
the
piano
all
young
gentlemen
are
compelled
to
affect
to
know
latin
in
the
same
way
the
public
opinion
of
society
compels
its
members
to
pretend
to
know
and
appreciate
the
masterpieces
of
literature
and
art
there
is
in
truth
so
much
compulsion
of
this
kind
that
it
is
not
easy
to
ascertain
what
people
do
really
know
and
care
about
until
they
admit
you
into
their
confidence
the
inevitable
effect
of
these
affectations
is
to
diminish
the
value
in
society
of
genuine
knowledge
and
accomplishment
of
all
kinds
i
know
a
man
who
is
a
latin
scholar
he
is
one
of
the
few
moderns
who
have
really
learned
latin
but
in
fashionable
society
this
brings
him
no
distinction
because
we
are
all
supposed
to
know
latin
and
the
true
scholar
when
he
appears
can
not
be
distinguished
from
the
multitude
of
fashionable
pretenders
i
know
another
man
who
can
draw
there
are
not
many
men
even
amongst
artists
who
can
draw
soundly
yet
in
fashionable
society
he
does
not
get
the
serious
sort
of
respect
which
he
deserves
because
fashionable
people
believe
that
drawing
is
an
accomplishment
generally
attainable
by
young
ladies
and
communicable
by
governesses
i
have
no
wish
to
insinuate
that
society
is
wrong
in
requiring
a
certain
pretence
to
education
in
various
subjects
and
a
certain
affectation
of
interest
in
masterpieces
for
these
pretences
and
affectations
do
serve
to
deliver
it
from
the
darkness
of
a
quite
absolute
ignorance
a
society
of
fashionable
people
who
think
it
necessary
to
be
able
to
talk
superficially
about
the
labors
of
men
really
belonging
to
the
intellectual
class
is
always
sure
to
be
much
better
informed
than
a
society
such
as
that
of
the
french
peasantry
for
example
where
nobody
is
expected
to
know
anything
it
is
well
for
society
itself
that
it
should
profess
a
deep
respect
for
classical
learning
for
the
great
modern
poets
and
painters
for
scientific
discoverers
even
though
the
majority
of
its
members
do
not
seriously
care
about
them
the
pretension
itself
requires
a
certain
degree
of
knowledge
as
gilding
requires
a
certain
quantity
of
gold
the
evil
effects
of
these
affectations
may
be
summed
up
in
a
sentence
they
diminish
the
apparent
value
of
the
realities
which
they
imitate
and
they
tend
to
weaken
our
enthusiasm
for
those
great
realities
and
our
ardor
in
the
pursuit
of
them
the
impression
which
fashionable
society
produces
upon
a
student
who
has
strength
enough
to
resist
it
is
a
painful
sense
of
isolation
in
his
earnest
work
if
he
goes
back
to
the
work
with
courage
undiminished
he
still
clearly
realizes
what
it
would
be
better
for
him
not
to
realize
quite
so
clearly
the
uselessness
of
going
beyond
fashionable
standards
if
he
aims
at
social
success
and
there
is
still
another
thing
to
be
said
which
concerns
you
just
now
very
particularly
whoever
leads
the
intellectual
life
in
earnest
is
sure
on
some
points
to
fail
in
strict
obedience
to
the
exigencies
of
fashionable
life
so
that
if
fashionable
successes
are
still
dear
to
him
he
will
be
constantly
tempted
to
make
some
such
reflections
as
the
following
here
am
i
giving
years
and
years
of
labor
to
a
pursuit
which
brings
no
external
reward
when
half
as
much
work
would
keep
me
abreast
of
the
society
i
live
with
in
everything
it
really
cares
about
i
know
quite
well
all
that
my
learning
is
costing
me
other
men
outshine
me
easily
in
social
pleasures
and
accomplishments
my
skill
at
billiards
and
on
the
moors
is
evidently
declining
and
i
can
not
ride
or
drive
so
well
as
fellows
who
do
very
little
else
in
fact
i
am
becoming
an
old
muff
and
all
i
have
to
show
on
the
other
side
is
a
degree
of
scholarship
which
only
six
men
in
europe
can
appreciate
and
a
speciality
in
natural
science
in
which
my
little
discoveries
are
sure
to
be
either
anticipated
or
left
behind
the
truth
is
that
to
succeed
well
in
fashionable
society
the
higher
intellectual
attainments
are
not
so
useful
as
distinguished
skill
in
those
amusements
which
are
the
real
business
of
the
fashionable
world
the
three
things
which
tell
best
in
your
favor
amongst
young
gentlemen
are
to
be
an
excellent
shot
to
ride
well
to
hounds
and
to
play
billiards
with
great
skill
i
wish
to
say
nothing
against
any
of
these
accomplishments
having
an
especially
hearty
admiration
and
respect
for
all
good
horsemen
and
considering
the
game
of
billiards
the
most
perfectly
beautiful
of
games
still
the
fact
remains
that
to
do
these
things
as
well
as
some
young
gentlemen
do
them
we
must
devote
the
time
which
they
devote
and
if
we
regularly
give
nine
hours
a
day
to
graver
occupations
pray
how
and
where
are
we
to
find
it

a
young
gentleman
who
lived
much
in
fashionable
society
some
exceptional
men
may
live
alternately
in
different
worlds
instances
differences
between
the
fashionable
and
the
intellectual

sometimes
made
unfashionable
by
special
natural
gifts
sometimes
by
trifling
external
circumstances
anecdote
of
ampère
he
did
not
shine
in
society
his
wife
anxieties
about
his
material
wants
apparent
contrast
between
ampère
and
oliver
goldsmith
you
ask
me
why
there
should
be
any
fundamental
incompatibility
between
the
fashionable
and
the
intellectual
lives
it
seems
to
you
that
the
two
might
possibly
be
reconciled
and
you
mention
instances
of
men
who
attained
intellectual
distinction
without
deserting
the
fashionable
world
yes
there
been
a
few
examples
of
men
endowed
with
that
overflow
of
energy
which
permits
the
most
opposite
pursuits
and
enables
its
possessors
to
live
apparently
in
two
worlds
between
which
there
is
not
any
natural
affinity
a
famous
french
novelist
once
took
the
trouble
to
elaborate
the
portrait
of
a
lady
who
passed
one
half
of
her
time
in
virtue
and
churches
whilst
she
employed
the
other
half
in
the
wildest
adventures
in
real
life
i
may
allude
to
a
distinguished
english
engraver
who
spent
a
fortnight
over
his
plate
and
a
fortnight
in
some
fashionable
alternately
and
who
found
this
distribution
of
his
time
not
unfavorable
to
the
elasticity
of
his
mind
many
londoners
who
fairly
deserve
to
be
considered
intellectual
men
pass
their
days
in
professional
labor
and
their
evenings
in
fashionable
society
but
in
all
instances
of
this
kind
the
professional
work
is
serious
enough
and
regular
enough
to
give
a
very
substantial
basis
to
the
life
so
that
the
times
of
recreation
are
kept
daily
subordinate
by
the
very
necessity
of
circumstances
if
you
had
a
profession
and
were
obliged
to
follow
it
in
earnest
six
or
eight
hours
a
day
the
more
society
amused
you
the
better
the
danger
in
your
case
is
that
your
whole
existence
may
take
a
fashionable
tone
the
or
tone
of
fashion
differs
from
the
intellectual
tone
in
ways
which
i
will
attempt
to
define
fashion
is
nothing
more
than
the
temporary
custom
of
rich
and
idle
people
who
make
it
their
principal
business
to
study
the
external
elegance
of
life
this
custom
incessantly
changes
if
your
habits
of
mind
and
life
change
with
it
you
are
a
fashionable
person
but
if
your
habits
of
mind
and
life
either
remain
permanently
fixed
or
follow
some
law
of
your
own
individual
nature
then
you
are
outside
of
fashion
the
intellectual
spirit
is
remarkable
for
its
independence
of
custom
and
therefore
on
many
occasions
it
will
clash
with
the
fashionable
spirit
it
does
so
most
frequently
in
the
choice
of
pursuits
and
in
the
proportionate
importance
which
the
individual
student
will
in
his
own
case
assign
to
his
pursuits
the
regulations
of
fashionable
life
have
fixed
at
the
least
temporarily
the
degree
of
time
and
attention
which
a
fashionable
person
may
devote
to
this
thing
or
that
the
intellectual
spirit
ignores
these
regulations
and
devotes
its
possessor
or
more
accurately
its
to
the
intellectual
speciality
for
which
he
has
most
aptitude
often
leaving
him
ignorant
of
what
fashion
has
decided
to
be
essential
after
living
the
intellectual
life
for
several
years
he
will
know
too
much
of
one
thing
and
too
little
of
some
other
things
to
be
in
conformity
with
the
fashionable
ideal
for
example
the
fashionable
ideal
of
a
gentleman
requires
classical
scholarship
but
it
is
so
difficult
for
artists
and
men
of
science
to
be
classical
scholars
also
that
in
this
respect
they
are
likely
to
fall
short
i
knew
a
man
who
became
unfashionable
because
he
had
a
genius
for
mechanics
he
was
always
about
and
though
a
gentleman
by
birth
associated
from
choice
with
men
who
understood
the
science
that
chiefly
interested
him
of
which
all
fashionable
people
were
so
profoundly
ignorant
that
he
habitually
kept
out
of
their
way
he
on
his
part
neglected
scholarship
and
literature
and
all
that
artistry
of
life
as
robert
lytton
calls
it
in
which
fashionable
society
excels
men
are
frequently
driven
into
unfashionable
existence
by
the
very
force
and
vigor
of
their
own
intellectual
gifts
and
sometimes
by
external
circumstances
apparently
most
trifling
yet
of
infinite
influence
on
human
destiny
there
is
a
good
instance
of
this
in
a
letter
from
ampère
to
his
young
wife
that
julie
who
was
lost
to
him
so
soon
i
went
to
dine
yesterday
at
madame
beauregard
with
hands
blackened
by
a
harmless
drug
which
stains
the
skin
for
three
or
four
days
she
declared
that
it
looked
like
manure
and
left
the
table
saying
that
she
would
dine
when
i
was
at
a
distance
i
promised
not
to
return
there
before
my
hands
were
white
of
course
i
shall
never
enter
the
house
again
here
we
have
an
instance
of
a
man
of
science
who
has
temporarily
disqualified
himself
for
polite
society
by
an
experiment
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
what
do
you
think
of
the
vulgarity
of
madame
beauregard
to
me
it
appears
the
perfect
type
of
that
preoccupation
about
appearances
which
blinds
the
genteel
vulgar
to
the
true
nobility
of
life
were
not
ampère
stained
hands
nobler
than
many
white
ones
it
is
not
necessary
for
every
intellectual
worker
to
blacken
his
fingers
with
chemicals
but
a
kind
of
rust
very
frequently
comes
over
him
which
ought
to
be
as
readily
forgiven
yet
rarely
is
forgiven
in
his
relations
with
the
world
writes
the
biographer
of
ampère
the
authority
of
superiority
disappeared
to
this
the
course
of
years
brought
no
alternative
ampère
become
celebrated
laden
with
honorable
distinctions
the
great
ampère
outside
the
speculations
of
the
intellect
was
hesitating
and
timid
again
disquieted
and
troubled
and
more
disposed
to
accord
his
confidence
to
others
than
to
himself
intellectual
pursuits
did
not
qualify
ampère
they
do
not
qualify
any
one
for
success
in
fashionable
society
to
succeed
in
the
world
you
ought
to
be
the
world
so
as
to
share
the
things
which
interest
it
without
too
wide
a
deviation
from
the
prevalent
current
of
your
thoughts
its
passing
interests
its
temporary
customs
its
transient
phases
of
sentiment
and
opinion
ought
to
be
for
the
moment
your
own
interests
your
own
feelings
and
opinions
a
mind
absorbed
as
was
in
the
contemplation
and
elucidation
of
the
unchangeable
laws
of
nature
is
too
much
fixed
upon
the
permanent
to
adapt
itself
naturally
to
these
estimates
he
did
not
easily
speak
the
lighter
language
he
could
not
move
with
its
mobility
such
men
forget
even
what
they

and
what
they
put
on
ampère
young
wife
was
in
constant
anxiety
whilst
the
pair
were
separated
by
the
severity
of
their
fate
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
his
diet
and
the
decency
of
his
appearance
one
day
she
writes
to
him
to
mind
not
to
go
out
in
his
shabby
old
coat
and
in
the
same
letter
she
entreats
him
to
purchase
a
bottle
of
wine
so
that
when
he
took
no
milk
or
broth
he
would
find
it
and
when
it
was
all
drunk
she
tells
him
to
buy
another
bottle
afterwards
she
asks
him
whether
he
makes
a
good
fire
and
if
he
has
any
chairs
in
his
room
in
another
letter
she
inquires
if
his
bed
is
comfortable
and
in
another
she
tells
him
to
mind
about
his
acids
for
he
has
burnt
holes
in
his
blue
stockings
again
she
begs
him
to
try
to
have
a
passably
decent
appearance
because
that
will
give
pleasure
to
his
poor
wife
he
answers
to
tranquillize
her
that
he
does
not
burn
his
things
now
and
that
he
makes
chemical
experiments
only
in
his
old
breeches
with
his
gray
coat
and
his
waistcoat
of
greenish
velvet
but
one
day
he
is
forced
to
confess
that
she
must
send
him
new
trousers
if
he
is
to
appear
before
mm
delambre
and
villars
he
does
not
know
what
to
do
his
best
breeches
still
smell
of
turpentine
and
having
wished
to
put
on
trousers
to
go
to
the
society
of
emulation
he
saw
the
hole
which
barrat
fancied
he
had
mended
become
bigger
than
ever
so
that
it
showed
the
piece
of
different
cloth
which
he
had
sown
under
it
he
adds
that
his
wife
will
be
afraid
that
he
will
spoil
his
but
he
promises
to
send
it
back
to
her
as
clean
as
when
he
received
it
how
different
is
all
this
from
that
watchful
care
about
externals
which
marks
the
man
of
fashion
ampère
was
quite
a
young
man
then
still
almost
a
bridegroom
yet
he
is
already
so
absorbed
in
the
intellectual
life
as
to
forget
appearances
utterly
except
when
julie
with
feminine
watchfulness
writes
to
recall
them
to
his
mind
i
am
not
defending
or
advocating
this
carelessness
it
is
better
to
be
neat
and
tidy
than
to
go
in
holes
and
patches
but
i
desire
to
insist
upon
the
radical
difference
between
the
fashionable
spirit
and
the
intellectual
spirit
and
this
difference
which
shows
itself
in
these
external
things
is
not
less
evident
in
the
clothing
or
preparation
of
the
mind
intellect
great
and
noble
as
it
was
could
scarcely
be
considered
more
suitable
for
grand
than
the
breeches
that
smelt
of
turpentine
or
the
trousers
made
ragged
by
aquafortis
a
splendid
contrast
as
to
tailoring
was
our
own
dear
oliver
goldsmith
who
displayed
himself
in
those
wonderful
velvet
coats
and
satin
from
filby
which
are
more
famous
than
the
finest
garments
ever
worn
by
prince
or
peer
who
does
not
remember
that
coat
which
the
ablest
painters
have
studiously
immortalized
made
by
john
filby
at
the
harrow
in
water
lane
best
advertised
of
tailors
and
that
charming
blue
velvet
suit
which
filby
was
never
paid
for
surely
a
poet
so
splendid
was
fit
for
the
career
of
fashion
no
oliver
goldsmith
velvet
and
lace
were
the
expression
of
a
deep
and
painful
sense
of
personal
unfitness
they
were
the
fine
frame
which
is
intended
to
pass
off
an
awkward
and
imperfect
picture
there
was
a
quieter
dignity
in
johnson
threadbare
sleeves
johnson
the
most
influential
though
not
the
most
elegant
intellect
of
his
time
is
grander
in
his
neglect
of
fashion
than
goldsmith
in
his
ruinous
subservience
and
if
it
were
permitted
to
me
to
speak
of
two
or
three
great
geniuses
who
adorn
the
age
in
which
we
ourselves
are
living
i
might
add
that
they
seem
to
follow
the
example
of
the
author
of
rasselas
rather
than
that
of
filby
illustrious
customer
they
remind
me
of
a
good
old
squire
who
from
a
fine
sentiment
of
duty
permitted
the
village
artist
to
do
his
worst
upon
him
and
incurred
thereby
this
withering
observation
from
his
metropolitan
tailor
you
are

letter
iv
to
a
young
gentleman
who
lived
much
in
fashionable
society
test
of
professions
mobility
of
fashionable
taste
practical
service
of
an
external
deference
to
culture
incompatibility
between
fashionable
and
intellectual
lives
what
each
has
to
offer
your
polite
almost
diplomatic
answer
to
my
letter
about
fashionable
society
may
be
not
unfairly
concentrated
into
some
such
paragraph
as
the
following
what
grounds
have
i
for
concluding
that
the
professed
tastes
and
opinions
of
society
are
in
any
degree
insincere
may
not
society
be
quite
sincere
in
the
preferences
which
it
professes
and
are
not
the
preferences
themselves
almost
always
creditable
to
the
good
taste
and
really
advanced
culture
of
the
society
which
i
suspect
of
a
certain
degree
of
affectation
this
is
the
sense
of
your
letter
and
in
reply
to
it
i
give
you
a
simple
but
sure
test
is
the
professed
opinion
carried
out
in
practice
when
there
are
fair
opportunities
for
practice
let
us
go
so
far
as
to
examine
a
particular
instance
your
friends
profess
to
appreciate
classical
literature
do
they
read
it
or
on
the
other
hand
do
they
confine
themselves
to
believing
that
it
is
a
good
thing
for
other
people
to
read
it
when
i
was
a
schoolboy
people
told
me
that
the
classical
authors
of
antiquity
were
eminently
useful
and
indeed
absolutely
necessary
to
the
culture
of
the
human
mind
but
i
perceived
that
they
did
not
read
them
so
i
have
heard
many
people
express
great
respect
for
art
and
science
only
they
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
master
any
department
of
art
or
science
if
you
will
apply
this
test
to
the
professions
of
what
is
especially
called
fashionable
society
it
is
probable
that
you
will
arrive
at
the
conclusions
of
the
minority
which
i
have
endeavored
to
express
you
will
find
that
the
fashionable
world
remains
very
contentedly
outside
the
true
working
intellectual
life
and
does
not
really
share
either
its
labors
or
its
aspirations
another
kind
of
evidence
which
tells
in
the
same
direction
is
the
mobility
of
fashionable
taste
at
one
time
some
studies
are
fashionable
at
another
time
these
are
neglected
and
others
have
taken
their
place
you
will
not
find
this
fickleness
in
the
true
intellectual
world
which
steadily
pursues
all
its
various
studies
and
keeps
them
well
abreast
century
after
century
if
i
insist
upon
this
distinction
with
reference
to
you
do
not
accuse
me
of
hostility
even
to
fashion
itself
fashion
is
one
of
the
great
divine
institutions
of
human
society
and
the
best
philosophy
rebels
against
none
of
the
authorities
that
be
but
studies
and
endeavors
to
explain
them
the
external
deference
which
society
yields
to
culture
is
practically
of
great
service
although
i
repeat
the
epithet
it
is
the
sort
of
good
effect
is
in
the
intellectual
sphere
what
the
good
effect
of
a
general
religious
profession
is
in
the
moral
sphere
all
fashionable
society
goes
to
church
fashionable
religion
differs
from
the
religion
of
peter
and
paul
as
fashionable
science
differs
from
that
of
humboldt
and
arago
yet
notwithstanding
this
difference
the
profession
of
religion
is
useful
to
society
as
some
restraint
at
least
during
one
day
out
of
seven
upon
its
inveterate
tendency
to
live
exclusively
for
its
amusement
and
if
any
soul
happens
to
come
into
existence
in
the
fashionable
world
which
has
the
genuine
religious
nature
that
nature
has
a
chance
of
developing
itself
and
of
finding
ready
to
hand
certain
customs
which
are
favorable
to
its
so
it
is
though
in
quite
a
different
direction
with
the
esteem
which
society
professes
for
intellectual
pursuits
it
is
an
esteem
in
great
part
merely
nominal
as
fashionable
christianity
is
nominal
and
still
it
helps
and
favors
the
early
development
of
the
genuine
faculty
where
it
exists
it
is
certainly
a
great
help
to
us
that
fashionable
society
which
has
such
a
tremendous
such
an
almost
irresistible
power
for
good
or
evil
does
not
openly
discourage
our
pursuits
but
on
the
contrary
regards
them
with
great
external
deference
and
respect
the
recognition
which
society
has
given
to
artists
has
been
wanting
in
frankness
and
in
promptitude
though
even
in
this
case
much
may
be
said
to
excuse
a
sort
of
hesitation
rather
than
refusal
which
was
attributable
to
the
strangeness
and
novelty
of
the
artistic
caste
in
england
but
society
has
far
more
than
a
generation
professed
a
respect
for
literature
and
erudition
which
has
helped
those
two
branches
of
culture
more
effectually
than
great
subsidies
of
money
the
exact
truth
seems
to
be
that
society
is
sincere
in
approving
our
devotion
to
these
pursuits
but
is
not
yet
sufficiently
interested
in
them
to
appreciate
them
otherwise
than
from
the
outside
just
as
a
father
and
mother
applaud
their
boys
for
reading
thucydides
yet
do
not
read
him
themselves
either
in
the
original
or
in
a
translation
all
that
i
care
to
insist
upon
is
that
there
is
a
degree
of
incompatibility
between
the
fashionable
and
the
intellectual
lives
which
makes
it
necessary
at
a
certain
time
to
choose
one
or
the
other
as
our
own
there
is
no
hostility
there
need
not
be
any
uncharitable
feeling
on
one
side
or
the
other
but
there
must
be
a
resolute
choice
between
the
two
if
you
decide
for
the
intellectual
life
you
will
incur
a
definite
loss
to
set
against
your
gain
your
existence
may
have
calmer
and
profounder
satisfactions
but
it
will
be
less
amusing
and
even
in
an
appreciable
degree
less
less
in
harmony
i
mean
with
the
common
instincts
and
feelings
of
humanity
for
the
fashionable
world
although
decorated
by
habits
of
expense
has
enjoyment
for
its
object
and
arrives
at
enjoyment
by
those
methods
which
the
experience
of
generations
has
proved
to
be
most
efficacious
variety
of
amusement
frequent
change
of
scenery
and
society
healthy
exercise
pleasant
occupation
of
the
mind
without
fatigue
these
things
do
indeed
make
existence
agreeable
to
human
nature
and
the
science
of
living
agreeably
is
better
understood
in
the
fashionable
society
of
england
than
by
laborious
students
and
the
life
led
by
that
society
is
the
true
heaven
of
the
natural
man
who
likes
to
have
frequent
feasts
and
a
hearty
appetite
who
enjoys
the
varying
spectacle
of
wealth
and
splendor
and
pleasure
who
loves
to
watch
from
the
olympus
of
his
personal
ease
the
curious
results
of
labor
in
which
he
takes
no
part
the
interesting
ingenuity
of
the
toiling
world
below
in
exchange
for
these
varied
pleasures
of
the
spectator
the
intellectual
life
can
offer
you
but
one
satisfaction
for
all
its
promises
are
reducible
simply
to
this
that
you
shall
come
at
last
after
infinite
labor
into
contact
with
some
great
that
you
shall
know
and
do
in
such
sort
that
you
will
feel
yourself
on
firm
ground
and
be
recognized
probably
not
much
applauded
but
yet
recognized
as
a
by
other
knowers
and
doers
before
you
come
to
this
most
of
your
present
accomplishments
will
be
abandoned
by
yourself
as
unsatisfactory
and
insufficient
but
one
or
two
of
them
will
be
turned
to
better
account
and
will
give
you
after
many
years
a
tranquil
and
what
is
still
rarer
and
better
a
very
deep
and
earnest
reverence
for
the
greatness
which
is
above
you
severed
from
the
vanities
of
the
illusory
you
will
live
with
the
realities
of
knowledge
as
one
who
has
quitted
the
painted
scenery
of
the
theatre
to
listen
by
the
eternal
ocean
or
gaze
at
the
granite
hills
letter
to
a
young
gentleman
who
kept
entirely
out
of
company
that
society
which
is
frivolous

the
mass

individuals
who
are
not
frivolous
a
piece
of
the
author
early
experience
those
who
keep
out
of
society
miss
opportunities
people
talk
about
what
they
have
in
common
that
we
ought
to
be
tolerant
of
dulness
the
loss
to
society
if
superior
men
all
held
aloof
utility
of
the
gifted
in
general
society
they
ought
not
to
submit
to
expulsion
i
willingly
concede
all
that
you
say
against
fashionable
society
as
a
whole
it
is
as
you
say
frivolous
bent
on
amusement
incapable
of
attention
sufficiently
prolonged
to
grasp
any
serious
subject
and
liable
both
to
confusion
and
inaccuracy
in
the
ideas
which
it
hastily
forms
or
easily
receives
you
do
right
assuredly
not
to
let
it
waste
your
most
valuable
hours
but
i
believe
also
that
you
do
wrong
in
keeping
out
of
it
altogether
the
society
which
seems
so
frivolous
in
masses
contains
individual
members
who
if
you
knew
them
better
would
be
able
and
willing
to
render
you
the
most
efficient
intellectual
help
and
you
miss
this
help
by
restricting
yourself
exclusively
to
books
nothing
can
replace
the
conversation
of
living
men
and
women
not
even
the
richest
literature
can
replace
it
many
years
ago
i
was
thrown
by
accident
amongst
a
certain
society
of
englishmen
who
when
they
were
all
together
never
talked
about
anything
worth
talking
about
their
general
conversations
were
absolutely
empty
and
null
and
i
concluded
as
young
men
so
easily
conclude
that
those
twenty
or
thirty
gentlemen
had
not
half
a
dozen
ideas
amongst
them
a
little
reflection
might
have
reminded
me
that
my
own
talk
was
no
better
than
theirs
and
consequently
that
there
might
be
others
in
the
company
who
also
knew
more
and
thought
more
than
they
expressed
i
found
out
by
accident
after
awhile
that
some
of
these
men
had
more
than
common
culture
in
various
directions
one
or
two
had
travelled
far
and
brought
home
the
results
of
much
observation
one
or
two
had
read
largely
and
with
profit
more
than
one
had
studied
a
science
five
or
six
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
it
was
a
youthful
mistake
to
conclude
that
because
their
general
conversation
was
very
dull
the
men
were
dull
individually
the
general
conversations
of
english
society
dull
it
is
a
national
characteristic
but
the
men
themselves
are
individually
often
very
well
informed
and
quite
capable
of
imparting
their
information
to
a
single
interested
listener
the
art
is
to
be
that
listener
englishmen
have
the
greatest
dread
of
producing
themselves
in
the
of
a
general
conversation
because
they
fear
that
their
special
topics
may
not
be
cared
for
by
some
of
the
persons
present
but
if
you
can
get
one
of
them
into
a
quiet
corner
by
himself
and
humor
his
shyness
with
sufficient
delicacy
and
tact
he
will
disburden
his
mind
at
last
and
experience
a
relief
in
so
doing
by
keeping
out
of
society
altogether
you
miss
these
precious
opportunities
the
wise
course
is
to
mix
as
much
with
the
world
as
may
be
possible
without
withdrawing
too
much
time
from
your
serious
studies
but
not
to
expect
anything
valuable
from
the
general
talk
which
is
nothing
but
a
neutral
medium
in
which
intelligences
float
and
move
as
yachts
do
in
and
for
which
they
ought
not
to
be
held
individually
responsible
the
talk
of
society
answers
its
purpose
if
it
simply
permits
many
different
people
to
come
together
without
clashing
and
the
purpose
of
its
conventions
is
the
avoidance
of
collision
in
england
the
small
talk
is
heavy
like
water
in
france
it
is
light
as
air
in
both
countries
it
is
a
medium
and
no
more
society
talks
by
preference
about
amusements
it
does
so
because
when
people
meet
for
recreation
they
wish
to
relieve
their
minds
from
serious
cares
and
also
for
the
practical
reason
that
society
must
talk
about
what
its
members
have
in
common
and
their
amusements
are
more
in
common
than
their
work
as
thiers
recommended
the
republican
form
of
government
in
france
on
the
ground
that
it
was
the
form
which
divided
his
countrymen
least
so
a
polite
and
highly
civilized
society
chooses
for
the
subject
of
general
conversation
the
topic
which
is
least
likely
to
separate
the
different
people
who
are
present
it
almost
always
happens
that
the
best
topic
having
this
recommendation
is
some
species
of
amusement
since
amusements
are
easily
learnt
outside
the
business
of
life
and
we
are
all
initiated
into
them
in
youth
for
these
reasons
i
think
that
we
ought
to
be
extremely
tolerant
of
the
dulness
or
frivolity
which
may
seem
to
prevail
in
any
numerous
company
and
not
to
conclude
too
hastily
that
the
members
of
it
are
in
any
degree
more
dull
or
frivolous
than
ourselves
it
is
unfortunate
certainly
that
the
art
of
general
conversation
is
not
so
successfully
cultivated
as
it
might
be
and
there
are
reasons
for
believing
that
our
posterity
will
surpass
us
in
this
respect
because
as
culture
increases
the
spirit
of
toleration
increases
with
it
so
that
the
great
questions
of
politics
and
religion
in
which
all
are
interested
may
be
discussed
more
safely
than
they
could
be
at
the
present
day
by
persons
of
different
ways
of
thinking
but
even
the
sort
of
general
conversation
we
have
now
poor
as
it
may
seem
still
sufficiently
serves
as
a
medium
for
human
intercourse
and
permits
us
to
meet
on
a
common
ground
where
we
may
select
at
leisure
the
agreeable
or
instructive
friends
that
our
higher
intellect
needs
and
without
whom
the
intellectual
life
is
one
of
the
ghastliest
of
solitudes
and
now
permit
me
to
add
a
few
observations
on
another
aspect
of
this
subject
which
is
not
without
its
importance
let
us
suppose
that
every
one
of
rather
more
than
ordinary
capacity
and
culture
were
to
act
as
you
yourself
are
acting
and
withdraw
entirely
from
general
society
let
us
leave
out
of
consideration
for
the
present
the
loss
to
their
private
culture
which
would
be
the
consequence
of
missing
every
opportunity
for
forming
new
intellectual
friendships
let
us
consider
this
time
what
would
be
the
consequence
to
society
itself
if
all
the
cultivated
men
were
withdrawn
from
it
the
general
tone
of
society
would
inevitably
descend
much
lower
even
than
it
is
at
present
it
would
sink
so
low
that
the
whole
national
intellect
would
undergo
a
sure
and
inevitable
deterioration
it
is
plainly
the
duty
of
men
situated
as
you
are
who
have
been
endowed
by
nature
with
superior
faculties
and
who
have
enlarged
them
by
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
to
preserve
society
by
their
presence
from
an
evil
so
surely
prolific
of
bad
consequences
if
society
is
less
narrow
and
selfish
and
intolerant
and
apathetic
than
it
used
to
be
it
is
because
they
who
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
have
not
disdained
to
mix
with
its
grosser
and
earthier
elements
all
the
improvement
in
public
sentiment
and
the
advancement
in
general
knowledge
which
have
marked
the
course
of
recent
generations
are
to
be
attributed
to
the
wholesome
influence
of
men
who
could
think
and
feel
and
who
steadily
exercised
often
quite
obscurely
yet
not
the
less
usefully
in
their
time
and
place
the
subtle
but
powerful
attraction
of
the
greater
mind
over
the
less
instead
of
complaining
that
people
are
ignorant
and
frivolous
we
ought
to
go
amongst
them
and
lead
them
to
the
higher
life
i
know
not
how
it
is
said
one
in
a
dull
circle
to
a
more
gifted
friend
who
entered
it
occasionally
when
we
are
left
to
ourselves
we
are
all
lamentably
stupid
but
whenever
you
are
kind
enough
to
come
amongst
us
we
all
talk
very
much
better
and
of
things
that
are
well
worth
talking
about
the
gifted
man
is
always
welcome
if
only
he
will
stoop
to
conquer
and
forget
himself
to
give
light
and
heat
to
others
the
low
philistinism
of
many
a
provincial
town
is
due
mainly
to
the
shy
reserve
of
the
one
or
two
superior
men
who
fancy
that
they
can
not
amalgamate
with
the
common
intellect
of
the
place
not
only
would
i
advocate
a
little
patient
condescension
but
even
something
of
the
sturdier
temper
which
will
not
be
driven
out
are
the
philistines
to
have
all
the
talk
to
themselves
forever
are
they
to
rehearse
their
stupid
old
platitudes
without
the
least
fear
of
contradiction
how
long
o
lord
how
long
let
us
resolve
that
even
in
general
society
they
shall
not
eternally
have
things
their
own
way
somebody
ought
to
have
the
courage
to
enlighten
them

at
their
own

in

unto

that
is
never

can
not

and

gratefully
for
thousands
of
sweet
hours
that
have

under

society
is
necessary
to
give
us
our
share
and
place
in
the
collective
life
of
humanity
but
solitude
is
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
the
individual
life
society
is
to
the
individual
what
travel
and
commerce
are
to
a
nation
whilst
solitude
represents
the
home
life
of
the
nation
during
which
it
develops
its
especial
originality
and
genius
the
life
of
the
perfect
hermit
and
that
of
those
persons
who
feel
themselves
nothing
individually
and
have
no
existence
but
what
they
receive
from
others
are
alike
imperfect
lives
the
perfect
life
is
like
that
of
a
ship
of
war
which
has
its
own
place
in
the
fleet
and
can
share
in
its
strength
and
discipline
but
can
also
go
forth
alone
in
the
solitude
of
the
infinite
sea
we
ought
to
belong
to
society
to
have
our
place
in
it
and
yet
to
be
capable
of
a
complete
individual
existence
outside
of
it
which
of
the
two
is
the
grander
the
ship
in
the
disciplined
fleet
arranged
in
order
of
battle
or
the
ship
alone
in
the
tempest
a
thousand
miles
from
land
the
truest
grandeur
of
the
ship
is
neither
in
one
nor
the
other
but
in
the
capacity
for
both
what
would
that
captain
merit
who
either
had
not
seamanship
enough
to
work
under
the
eye
of
the
admiral
or
else
had
not
sufficient
knowledge
of
navigation
to
be
trusted
out
of
the
range
of
signals
i
value
society
for
the
abundance
of
ideas
that
it
brings
before
us
like
carriages
in
a
frequented
street
but
i
value
solitude
for
sincerity
and
peace
and
for
the
better
understanding
of
the
thoughts
that
are
truly
ours
only
in
solitude
do
we
learn
our
inmost
nature
and
its
needs
he
who
has
lived
for
some
great
space
of
existence
apart
from
the
tumult
of
the
world
has
discovered
the
vanity
of
the
things
for
which
he
has
no
natural
aptitude
or
gift
their
vanity
i
mean
their
uselessness
to
himself
personally
and
at
the
same
time
he
has
learned
what
is
truly
precious
and
good
for
him
surely
this
is
knowledge
of
inestimable
value
to
a
man
surely
it
is
a
great
thing
for
any
one
in
the
bewildering
confusion
of
distracting
toils
and
pleasures
to
have
found
out
the
labor
that
he
is
most
fit
for
and
the
pleasures
that
satisfy
him
best
society
so
encourages
us
in
affectations
that
it
scarcely
leaves
us
a
chance
of
knowing
our
own
minds
but
in
solitude
this
knowledge
comes
of
itself
and
delivers
us
from
innumerable
vanities
montaigne
tells
us
that
at
one
time
he
bought
books
from
ostentation
but
that
afterwards
he
bought
only
such
books
as
he
wanted
for
his
private
reading
in
the
first
of
these
conditions
of
mind
we
may
observe
the
influence
of
society
in
the
second
the
effect
of
solitude
the
man
of
the
world
does
not
consult
his
own
intellectual
needs
but
considers
the
eyes
of
his
visitors
the
solitary
student
takes
his
literature
as
a
lonely
traveller
takes
food
when
he
is
hungry
without
reference
to
the
ordered
courses
of
public
hospitality
it
is
a
traditional
habit
of
mankind
to
see
only
the
disadvantages
of
solitude
without
considering
its
compensations
but
there
are
great
compensations
some
of
the
greatest
being
negative
the
lonely
man
is
lord
of
his
own
hours
and
of
his
own
purse
his
days
are
long
and
unbroken
he
escapes
from
every
form
of
ostentation
and
may
live
quite
simply
and
sincerely
in
great
calm
breadths
of
leisure
i
knew
one
who
passed
his
summers
in
the
heart
of
a
vast
forest
in
a
common
thatched
cottage
with
furniture
of
common
deal
and
for
this
retreat
he
quitted
very
gladly
a
rich
fine
house
in
the
city
he
wore
nothing
but
old
clothes
read
only
a
few
old
books
without
the
least
regard
to
the
opinions
of
the
learned
and
did
not
take
in
a
newspaper
on
the
wall
of
his
habitation
he
inscribed
with
a
piece
of
charcoal
a
quotation
from
de
sénancour
to
this
effect
in
the
world
a
man
lives
in
his
own
age
in
solitude
in
all
the
ages
i
observed
in
him
the
effects
of
a
lonely
life
and
he
greatly
aided
my
observations
by
frankly
communicating
his
experiences
that
solitude
had
become
inexpressibly
dear
to
him
but
he
admitted
one
evil
consequence
of
it
which
was
an
increasing
unfitness
for
ordinary
society
though
he
cherished
a
few
tried
friendships
and
was
grateful
to
those
who
loved
him
and
could
enter
into
his
humor
he
had
acquired
a
horror
of
towns
and
crowds
not
from
nervousness
but
because
he
felt
imprisoned
and
impeded
in
his
thinking
which
needed
the
depths
of
the
forest
the
venerable
trees
the
communication
with
primæval
nature
from
which
he
drew
a
mysterious
yet
necessary
nourishment
for
the
peculiar
activity
of
his
mind
i
found
that
his
case
answered
very
exactly
to
the
sentence
he
quoted
from
de
sénancour
he
lived
less
in
his
own
age
than
others
do
but
he
had
a
fine
compensation
in
a
strangely
vivid
understanding
of
other
ages
like
de
sénancour
he
had
a
strong
sense
of
the
transitoriness
of
what
is
transitory
and
a
passionate
preference
for
all
that
the
human
mind
conceives
to
be
relatively
or
absolutely
permanent
this
trait
was
very
observable
in
his
talk
about
the
peoples
of
antiquity
and
in
the
delight
he
took
in
dwelling
rather
upon
everything
which
they
had
in
common
with
ourselves
than
on
those
differences
which
are
more
obvious
to
the
modern
spirit
his
temper
was
grave
and
earnest
but
unfailingly
cheerful
and
entirely
free
from
any
tendency
to
bitterness
the
habits
of
his
life
would
have
been
most
unfavorable
to
the
development
of
a
man
of
business
of
a
statesman
of
a
leader
in
practical
enterprise
but
they
were
certainly
not
unfavorable
to
the
growth
of
a
tranquil
and
comprehensive
intellect
capable
of
just
judgment
and
patriotism
he
had
not
the
spirit
of
the
newspapers
he
did
not
live
intensely
in
the
present
but
he
had
the
spirit
which
has
animated
great
poets
and
saints
and
sages
and
teachers
of
humanity
not
in
vain
had
he
lived
alone
with
nature
not
in
vain
had
he
watched
in
solemn
twilights
and
witnessed
many
a
dawn
there
is
there
a
strength
that
comes
to
us
in
solitude
from
that
shadowy
awful
presence
that
frivolous
crowds
repel
solitude
may
be
and
is
sometimes
deliberately
accepted
or
chosen
but
far
more
frequently
men
are
driven
into
it
by
nature
and
by
fate
they
go
into
solitude
to
escape
the
sense
of
isolation
which
is
always
most
intolerable
when
there
are
many
voices
round
us
in
loud
dissonance
with
our
sincerest
thought
it
is
a
great
error
to
encourage
in
young
people
the
love
of
noble
culture
in
the
hope
that
it
may
lead
them
more
into
what
is
called
good
society
high
culture
always
isolates
always
drives
men
out
of
their
class
and
makes
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
share
naturally
and
easily
the
common
around
them
they
seek
the
few
companions
who
can
understand
them
and
when
these
are
not
to
be
had
within
any
traversable
distance
they
sit
and
work
alone
very
possibly
too
in
some
instances
a
superior
culture
may
compel
the
possessor
of
it
to
hold
opinions
too
far
in
advance
of
the
opinions
prevalent
around
him
to
be
patiently
listened
to
or
tolerated
and
then
he
must
either
disguise
them
which
is
always
highly
distasteful
to
a
man
of
honor
or
else
submit
to
be
treated
as
an
enemy
to
human
welfare
cultivated
people
who
live
in
london
their
true
home
need
never
condemn
themselves
to
solitude
from
this
cause
but
in
the
provinces
there
are
many
places
where
it
is
not
easy
for
them
to
live
sociably
without
a
degree
of
reserve
that
is
more
wearisome
than
solitude
itself
and
however
much
pains
you
take
to
keep
your
culture
well
in
the
background
it
always
makes
you
rather
an
object
of
suspicion
to
people
who
have
no
culture
they
perceive
that
you
are
reserved
they
know
that
very
much
of
what
passes
in
your
mind
is
a
mystery
to
them
and
this
feeling
makes
them
uneasy
in
your
presence
even
afraid
of
you
and
not
indisposed
to
find
a
compensation
for
this
uncomfortable
feeling
in
sarcasms
behind
your
back
unless
you
are
gifted
with
a
truly
extraordinary
power
of
conciliating
goodwill
you
are
not
likely
to
get
on
happily
for
long
together
with
people
who
feel
themselves
your
inferiors
the
very
utmost
skill
and
caution
will
hardly
avail
to
hide
all
your
modes
of
thought
something
of
your
higher
philosophy
will
escape
in
an
unguarded
moment
and
give
offence
because
it
will
seem
foolish
or
incomprehensible
to
your
audience
there
is
no
safety
for
you
but
in
a
timely
withdrawal
either
to
a
society
that
is
prepared
to
understand
you
or
else
to
a
solitude
where
your
intellectual
superiorities
will
neither
be
a
cause
of
irritation
to
others
nor
of
vexation
to
yourself
like
all
our
instincts
the
instinct
of
solitude
has
its
especial
purpose
which
appears
to
be
the
protection
of
rare
and
delicate
natures
from
the
commonplace
world
around
them
though
recluses
are
considered
by
men
of
the
world
to
be
doomed
to
inevitable
incompetence
the
fact
is
that
many
of
them
have
reached
the
highest
distinction
in
intellectual
pursuits
if
shelley
had
not
disliked
general
society
as
he
did
the
originality
of
his
own
living
and
thinking
would
have
been
less
complete
the
influences
of
mediocre
people
who
of
course
are
always
in
the
majority
would
have
silently
but
surely
operated
to
the
destruction
of
that
unequalled
and
personal
delicacy
of
imagination
to
which
we
owe
what
is
inimitable
in
his
poetry
in
the
last
year
of
his
life
he
said
to
trelawny
of
mary
his
second
wife
she
ca
bear
solitude
nor
i
society
the
quick
coupled
with
the
dead
here
is
a
piteous
prayer
of
his
to
be
delivered
from
a
party
that
he
dreaded
mary
says
she
will
have
a
party
there
are
english
singers
here
the
sinclairs
and
she
will
ask
them
and
every
one
she
or
you
know
oh
the
horror
for
pity
go
to
mary
and
intercede
for
me
i
will
submit
to
any
other
species
of
torture
than
that
of
being
bored
to
death
by
idle
ladies
and
gentlemen
again
he
writes
to
mary
my
greatest
delight
would
be
utterly
to
desert
all
human
society
i
would
retire
with
you
and
our
child
to
a
solitary
island
in
the
sea
would
build
a
boat
and
shut
upon
my
retreat
the
of
the
world
i
would
read
no
reviews
and
talk
with
no
authors
if
i
dared
trust
my
imagination
it
would
tell
me
that
there
are
one
or
two
chosen
companions
beside
yourself
whom
i
should
desire
but
to
this
i
would
not
listen
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
the
devil
is
among
them
at
marlow
he
knew
little
of
his
neighbors
i
am
not
wretch
enough
he
said
to
tolerate
an
acquaintance
wordsworth
and
turner
if
less
systematic
in
their
isolation
were
still
solitary
workers
and
much
of
the
peculiar
force
and
originality
of
their
performance
is
due
to
their
independence
of
the
people
about
them
painters
are
especial
sufferers
from
the
visits
of
talkative
people
who
know
little
or
nothing
of
the
art
they
talk
about
and
yet
who
have
quite
influence
enough
to
disturb
the
painter
mind
by
proving
to
him
that
his
noblest
thoughts
are
surest
to
be
misunderstood
men
of
science
too
find
solitude
favorable
to
their
peculiar
work
because
it
permits
the
concentration
of
their
powers
during
long
periods
of
time
newton
had
a
great
repugnance
to
society
and
even
to
notoriety
a
feeling
which
is
different
and
in
men
of
genius
more
rare
no
one
can
doubt
however
that
newton
great
intellectual
achievements
were
due
in
some
measure
to
this
peculiarity
of
his
temper
which
permitted
him
to
ripen
them
in
the
sustained
tranquillity
necessary
to
difficult
investigations
auguste
comte
isolated
himself
not
only
from
preference
but
on
system
and
whatever
may
have
been
the
defects
of
his
remarkable
mind
and
the
weakness
of
its
ultimate
decay
it
is
certain
that
his
amazing
command
over
vast
masses
of
heterogeneous
material
would
have
been
incompatible
with
any
participation
in
the
passing
interests
of
the
world
nothing
in
intellectual
history
has
ever
exceeded
the
unshakable
firmness
of
purpose
with
which
he
dedicated
his
whole
being
to
the
elaboration
of
the
positive
philosophy
he
sacrificed
everything
to
it
position
time
health
and
all
the
amusements
and
opportunities
of
society
he
found
that
commonplace
acquaintances
disturbed
his
work
and
interfered
with
his
mastery
of
it
so
he
resolutely
renounced
them
others
have
done
great
things
in
isolation
that
was
not
of
their
own
choosing
yet
none
the
less
fruitful
for
them
and
for
mankind
it
was
not
when
milton
saw
most
of
the
world
but
in
the
forced
retirement
of
a
man
who
had
lost
health
and
eyesight
and
whose
party
was
hopelessly
defeated
that
he
composed
the
paradise
lost
it
was
during
tedious
years
of
imprisonment
that
bunyan
wrote
his
immortal
allegory
many
a
genius
has
owed
his
best
opportunities
to
poverty
because
poverty
had
happily
excluded
him
from
society
and
so
preserved
him
from
exigencies
and
frivolities
the
solitude
which
is
really
injurious
is
the
severance
from
all
who
are
capable
of
understanding
us
painters
say
that
they
can
not
work
effectively
for
very
long
together
when
separated
from
the
society
of
artists
and
that
they
must
return
to
london
or
paris
or
rome
to
avoid
an
oppressive
feeling
of
discouragement
which
paralyzes
their
productive
energy
authors
are
more
fortunate
because
all
cultivated
people
are
society
for
them
yet
even
authors
lose
strength
and
agility
of
thought
when
too
long
deprived
of
a
genial
intellectual
atmosphere
in
the
country
you
meet
with
cultivated
individuals
but
we
need
more
than
this
we
need
those
general
conversations
in
which
every
speaker
is
worth
listening
to
the
life
most
favorable
to
culture
would
have
its
times
of
open
and
equal
intercourse
with
the
best
minds
and
also
its
periods
of
retreat
my
ideal
would
be
a
house
in
london
not
far
from
one
or
two
houses
that
are
so
full
of
light
and
warmth
that
it
is
a
liberal
education
to
have
entered
them
and
a
solitary
tower
on
some
island
of
the
hebrides
with
no
companions
but
the
and
the
thundering
surges
of
the
atlantic
one
such
island
i
know
well
and
it
is
before
my
mind
eye
clear
as
a
picture
whilst
i
am
writing
it
stands
in
the
very
entrance
of
a
fine
loch
rising
above
two
hundred
feet
out
of
the
water
and
setting
its
granite
front
steep
against
the
western
ocean
when
the
evenings
are
clear
you
can
see
staffa
and
iona
like
blue
clouds
between
you
and
the
sunset
and
on
your
left
close
at
hand
the
granite
hills
of
mull
with
ulva
to
the
right
across
the
narrow
strait
it
was
the
dream
of
my
youth
to
build
a
tower
there
with
three
or
four
little
rooms
in
it
and
walls
as
strong
as
a
lighthouse
there
have
been
more
foolish
dreams
and
there
have
been
less
competent
teachers
than
the
tempests
that
would
have
roused
me
and
the
calms
that
would
have
brought
me
peace
if
any
serious
thought
if
any
noble
inspiration
might
have
been
hoped
for
surely
it
would
have
been
there
where
only
the
clouds
and
waves
were
transient
but
the
ocean
before
me
and
the
stars
above
and
the
mountains
on
either
hand
were
emblems
and
evidences
of
eternity
there
is
a
passage
in
scott
novel
the
pirate
which
illustrates
what
has
been
said
in
this
letter
about
the
necessity
for
concealing
superior
culture
in
the
presence
of
less
intellectual
companions
and
i
quote
it
the
more
willingly
that
scott
was
so
remarkably
free
from
any
morbid
aversion
to
society
and
so
capable
of
taking
a
sincere
interest
in
every
human
being
cleveland

i
thought
over
my
former
story
and
saw
that
seeming
more
brave
skilful
and
enterprising
than
others
had
gained
me
command
and
respect
and
that
seeming
more
gently
nurtured
and
more
civilized
than
they
had
made
them
envy
and
hate
me

a

that
since

could
not
lay

to

and
to
sink

a
little

which
concerns
you
and
all
of
us
but
i
made
the
extract
in
my
for
your
benefit
rather
than
my
own
because
the
truth
it
contains
has
been
borne
in
upon
me
by
my
own
experience
so
that
what
galton
says
did
not
give
me
a
new
conviction
but
only
confirmed
me
in
an
old
one
he
is
speaking
to
explorers
who
have
not
done
so
much
in
that
way
as
he
has
himself
and
though
the
subject
of
his
advice
is
the
conduct
of
an
exploring
party
in
the
wilds
of
australia
for
example
the
advice
itself
is
equally
useful
if
taken
metaphorically
and
applied
to
the
conduct
of
intellectual
labors
and
explorations
of
all
kinds
interest
yourself
says
galton
chiefly
in
the
progress
of
your
journey
and
do
not
look
forward
to
its
end
with
eagerness
it
is
better
to
think
of
a
return
to
civilization
not
as
an
end
to
hardship
and
a
haven
from
ill
but
as
a
thing
to
be
regretted
and
as
a
close
to
an
adventurous
and
pleasant
life
in
this
way
risking
less
you
will
insensibly
creep
on
making
connections
and
learning
the
capabilities
of
the
country
as
you
advance
which
will
be
found
invaluable
in
the
case
of
a
hurried
or
a
disastrous
return
and
thus
when
some
months
have
passed
by
you
will
look
back
with
surprise
on
the
great
distance
travelled
over
for
if
you
average
only
three
miles
a
day
at
the
end
of
the
year
you
will
have
advanced
which
is
a
very
considerable
exploration
the
fable
of
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
seems
expressly
intended
for
travellers
over
wide
and
unknown
tracts
yes
we
ought
to
interest
ourselves
chiefly
in
the
progress
of
our
work
and
not
to
look
forward
to
its
end
with
eagerness
that
eagerness
of
which
galton
speaks
has
spoiled
many
a
piece
of
work
besides
a
geographical
exploration
and
it
not
only
spoils
work
but
it
does
worse
it
spoils
life
also
how
am
i
to
enjoy
this
year
as
i
ought
if
i
am
continually
wishing
it
were
over
a
truly
intellectual
philosophy
must
begin
by
recognizing
the
fact
that
the
intellectual
paths
are
infinitely
long
that
there
will
always
be
new
horizons
behind
the
horizon
that
is
before
us
and
that
we
must
accept
a
gradual
advance
as
the
law
of
our
intellectual
life
it
is
our
business
to
move
forwards
but
we
ought
to
do
so
without
any
greater
feeling
of
hurry
than
that
which
affects
the
most
stationary
of
minds
not
a
bad
example
for
us
is
a
bargeman
wife
in
a
she
moves
movement
is
the
law
of
her
life
yet
she
is
as
tranquil
in
her
little
cabin
as
any
goodwife
on
shore
brewing
her
tea
and
preparing
her
buttered
toast
without
ever
thinking
about
getting
to
the
end
of
her
journey
for
if
that
voyage
were
ended
another
would
always
succeed
to
it
and
another
in
striking
contrast
to
the
unhurried
bargeman
wife
in
her
cabin
is
an
irritable
frenchman
in
the
corner
of
a
diligence
looking
at
his
watch
every
and
wishing
that
the
dust
and
rattle
were
over
and
he
were
in
his
own
at
home
those
who
really
lead
the
intellectual
life
and
have
embraced
it
for
better
and
for
worse
are
like
the
bargeman
wife
but
those
who
live
the
life
from
time
to
time
only
for
some
special
purpose
wishing
to
be
rid
of
it
as
soon
as
that
purpose
is
accomplished
are
like
the
sufferer
in
the
purgatory
of
the
diligence
is
there
indeed
really
any
true
intellectual
life
at
all
when
every
hour
of
labor
is
spoiled
by
a
feverish
eagerness
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
projected
task
you
can
not
take
a
bit
out
of
another
man
life
and
live
it
without
having
lived
the
previous
years
that
led
up
to
it
without
having
also
the
assured
hopes
for
the
years
that
lie
beyond
the
attempt
is
constantly
made
by
amateurs
of
all
kinds
and
by
men
of
temporary
purposes
and
it
always
fails
the
amateur
says
when
he
awakes
on
some
fine
summer
morning
and
draws
up
his
blind
and
looks
out
on
the
dewy
fields
ah
the
world
of
nature
is
beautiful
what
if
i
were
to
lead
the
life
of
an
artist
and
after
breakfast
he
seeks
up
his
old
box
of
watercolor
and
his
blockbook
and
stool
and
white
umbrella
and
what
not
and
sallies
forth
and
fixes
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
or
the
banks
of
the
amber
stream
the
day
that
he
passes
there
looks
like
an
artist
day
yet
it
is
not
it
has
not
been
preceded
by
the
three
or
four
thousand
days
which
ought
to
have
led
up
to
it
it
is
not
strong
in
the
assured
sense
of
present
skill
in
the
calm
knowledge
that
the
hours
will
bear
good
fruit
so
the
chances
are
that
there
will
be
some
hurry
and
fretfulness
and
impatience
under
the
shadow
of
that
white
parasol
and
also
that
when
the
day
is
over
there
will
be
a
disappointment
you
can
not
put
an
artist
day
into
the
life
of
any
one
but
an
artist
our
impatiences
come
mainly
i
think
from
an
amateurish
doubt
about
our
own
capacity
which
is
accompanied
by
a
fevered
eagerness
to
see
the
work
done
because
we
are
tormented
both
by
hopes
and
fears
so
long
as
it
is
in
progress
we
have
fears
that
it
may
not
turn
out
as
it
ought
to
do
and
we
have
at
the
same
time
hopes
for
its
success
both
these
causes
produce
eagerness
and
deprive
us
of
the
tranquillity
which
distinguishes
the
thorough
workman
and
which
is
necessary
to
thoroughness
in
the
work
itself
now
please
observe
that
i
am
not
advising
you
to
set
aside
these
hopes
and
fears
by
an
effort
of
the
will
when
you
have
them
they
are
the
inevitable
result
of
your
state
of
culture
and
the
will
can
no
more
get
rid
of
them
than
it
can
get
rid
of
an
organic
disease
when
you
have
a
limited
amount
of
power
and
of
culture
and
are
not
quite
clear
in
your
own
mind
as
to
where
the
limits
lie
it
is
natural
on
the
one
hand
that
you
should
fear
the
insufficiency
of
what
you
possess
and
on
the
other
that
in
more
sanguine
moments
you
should
indulge
in
hopes
which
are
only
extravagant
because
your
powers
have
not
yet
been
accurately
measured
you
will
alternate
between
fear
and
hope
according
to
the
temporary
predominance
of
saddening
or
cheerful
ideas
but
both
these
feelings
will
urge
you
to
complete
the
work
in
hand
that
you
may
see
your
own
powers
reflected
in
it
and
measure
them
more
exactly
this
is
the
main
cause
of
the
eagerness
of
young
authors
and
the
reason
why
they
often
launch
work
upon
the
sea
of
publicity
which
is
sure
to
go
immediately
to
the
bottom
from
the
unworkmanlike
haste
with
which
it
has
been
put
together
but
beyond
this
there
is
another
cause
which
is
that
beginners
in
literature
have
rarely
acquired
firm
intellectual
habits
that
they
do
not
yet
lead
the
tranquil
intellectual
life
so
that
such
a
piece
of
work
as
the
composition
of
a
book
keeps
them
in
an
unwholesome
state
of
excitement
when
you
feel
this
coming
upon
you
pray
remember
galton
wise
traveller
in
unknown
tracts
or
the
bargeman
wife
in
the
amongst
the
many
advantages
of
experience
one
of
the
most
valuable
is
that
we
come
to
know
the
range
of
our
own
powers
and
if
we
are
wise
we
keep
contentedly
within
them
this
relieves
us
from
the
malady
of
eagerness
we
know
pretty
accurately
beforehand
what
our
work
will
be
when
it
is
done
and
therefore
we
are
not
in
a
hurry
to
see
it
accomplished
the
coolness
of
old
hands
in
all
departments
of
labor
is
due
in
part
to
the
cooling
of
the
temperament
by
age
but
it
is
due
even
more
to
the
fulness
of
acquired
experience
for
we
do
not
find
men
so
cool
in
situations
where
they
feel
themselves
incompetent
the
conduct
of
the
most
experienced
painters
in
the
management
of
their
work
is
a
good
example
of
this
masterly
coolness
because
we
can
see
them
painting
in
their
studios
whereas
we
can
not
so
easily
see
or
so
justly
estimate
the
coolness
of
scientific
or
literary
workmen
a
painter
of
great
experience
will
have
usually
several
pictures
at
a
time
upon
his
easels
and
pass
an
hour
upon
one
or
an
hour
upon
the
other
simple
as
the
state
of
the
pigment
invites
him
without
ever
being
tempted
to
risk
anything
by
hurrying
a
process
the
ugly
preparatory
daubing
which
irritates
the
impatience
of
the
beginner
does
not
disturb
equanimity
he
has
laid
it
with
a
view
to
the
result
and
it
satisfies
him
temporarily
as
the
right
thing
for
the
time
being
if
you
know
what
is
the
right
thing
for
the
time
being
and
always
do
it
you
are
sure
of
the
calm
of
the
thorough
workman
all
his
touches
except
the
very
last
touch
on
each
work
are
touches
of
preparation
leading
gradually
up
to
his
result
ingres
used
to
counsel
his
pupils
to
sketch
always
to
sketch
upon
and
within
the
first
sketch
till
the
picture
came
right
in
the
end
and
this
was
strictly
balzac
method
in
literature
the
literary
and
artistic
labors
of
these
two
men
did
not
proceed
so
much
upon
the
principle
of
travelling
as
upon
that
of
cultivation
they
took
an
idea
in
the
rough
as
a
settler
takes
a
tract
from
wild
nature
and
then
they
went
over
it
repeatedly
each
time
pushing
the
cultivation
of
it
a
little
farther
scott
horace
vernet
john
phillip
and
many
others
have
worked
rather
on
the
principle
of
travelling
passing
over
the
ground
once
and
leaving
it
never
coming
back
again
to
correct
the
mistakes
of
yesterday
both
methods
of
work
require
deliberation
but
the
latter
needs
it
in
the
supreme
degree
all
very
decided
workers
men
who
did
not
correct
have
been
at
the
same
time
very
deliberate
workers
rapid
in
the
sense
of
accomplishing
much
in
the
course
of
the
year
or
the
life
but
cautious
and
slow
and
observant
whilst
they
actually
labored
thinking
out
very
carefully
every
sentence
before
they
wrote
it
every
touch
of
paint
before
they
laid
it
letter

to
a
student
in
the
first
ardor
of
intellectual
ambition
the
first
freshness

should
it
not
be
preserved

dulness
of
the
intellectual
fictions
and
false
promises

the

now
i

why

it
would
be
an
experiment
worth
trying
so
to
order
your
intellectual
life
that
however
stony
and
thorny
your
path
might
be
however
difficult
and
arduous
it
should
at
all
events
never
be
dull
or
to
express
what
i
mean
more
accurately
that
you
yourself
should
never

the
depressing
influences
of

during

years
when
they
are
most
to
be
dreaded
i
want
you
to
live
steadily
and
happily
in
your
intellectual
labors
even
to
the
natural
close
of
existence
and
my
best
wish
for
you
is
that
you
may
escape
a
long
and
miserable
malady
which
very
commonly
suffer
from
when
the
first
dreams
of
youth
have
been
disappointed
a
malady
in
which
the
intellectual
desires
are
feeble
the
intellectual
hopes
are
few
whose
victim
if
he
has
still
resolution
enough
to
learn
anything
acquires
without
satisfaction
and
if
he
has
courage
to
create
has
neither
pride
nor
pleasure
in
his
creations
if
i
were
to
sing
the
praises
of
knowledge
as
they
have
been
so
often
sung
by
louder
harps
than
mine
i
might
avoid
so
dreary
a
theme
it
is
easy
to
pretend
to
believe
that
the
intellectual
life
is
always
sure
to
be
interesting
and
delightful
but
the
truth
is
that
either
from
an
unwise
arrangement
of
their
work
or
from
mental
or
physical
causes
which
we
will
investigate
to
some
extent
before
we
have
done
with
the
subject
many
men
whose
occupations
are
reputed
to
be
amongst
the
most
interesting
have
suffered
terribly
from
and
that
not
during
a
week
or
two
at
a
time
but
for
consecutive
years
and
years
there
is
a
class
of
books
written
with
the
praiseworthy
intention
of
stimulating
young
men
to
intellectual
labor
in
which
this
danger
of
the
intellectual
life
is
systematically
ignored
it
is
assumed
in
these
books
that
the
satisfactions
of
intellectual
labor
are
certain
that
although
it
may
not
always
or
often
result
in
outward
and
material
prosperity
its
inward
joys
will
never
fail
promises
of
this
kind
can
not
safely
be
made
to
any
one
the
satisfactions
of
intellectual
riches
are
not
more
sure
than
the
satisfactions
of
material
riches
the
feeling
of
dull
indifference
which
often
so
mysteriously
clouds
the
life
of
the
rich
man
in
the
midst
of
the
most
elaborate
contrivances
for
his
pleasure
and
amusement
has
its
exact
counterpart
in
the
lives
of
men
who
are
rich
in
the
best
treasures
of
the
mind
and
who
have
infinite
intellectual
resources
however
brilliant
your
ability
however
brave
and
persistent
your
industry
however
vast
your
knowledge
there
is
always
this
dreadful
possibility
of
people
tell
you
that
work
is
a
specific
against
it
but
many
a
man
has
worked
steadily
and
earnestly
and
suffered
terribly
from
all
the
time
that
he
was
working
although
the
labor
was
of
his
own
choice
the
labor
that
he
loved
best
and
for
which
nature
evidently
intended
him
the
poets
from
solomon
downwards
have
all
of
them
so
far
as
i
know
given
utterance
in
one
page
or
another
of
their
writings
to
this
feeling
of
dreary
dissatisfaction
and
albert
dürer
in
his
melencolia
illustrated
it
it
is
plain
that
the
robust
female
figure
which
has
exercised
the
ingenuity
of
so
many
commentators
is
not
melancholy
either
from
weakness
of
the
body
or
vacancy
of
the
mind
she
is
strong
and
she
is
learned
yet
though
the
plumes
of
her
wings
are
mighty
she
sits
heavily
and
listlessly
brooding
amidst
the
implements
of
suspended
labor
on
the
shore
of
a
waveless
sea
the
truth
is
that
dürer
engraved
the
melancholy
that
he
himself
only
too
intimately
knew
this
is
not
the
dulness
of
the
ignorant
and
incapable
whose
minds
are
a
blank
because
they
have
no
ideas
whose
hands
are
listless
for
want
of
an
occupation
it
is
the
sadness
of
the
most
learned
the
most
intelligent
the
most
industrious
the
weary
misery
of
those
who
are
rich
in
the
attainments
of
culture
who
have
the
keys
of
the
chambers
of
knowledge
and
wings
to
bear
them
to
the
heaven
of
the
ideal
if
you
counsel
this
melencolia
to
work
that
she
may
be
merry
she
will
answer
that
she
knows
the
uses
of
labor
and
its
vanity
and
the
precise
amount
of
profit
that
a
man
hath
of
all
his
labor
which
he
taketh
under
the
sun
all
things
are
full
of
labor
she
will
tell
you
and
in
much
wisdom
is
much
grief
and
he
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
can
we
escape
this
brooding
melancholy
of
the
great
workers
has
any
truly
intellectual
person
escaped
it
ever
the
question
can
never
be
answered
with
perfect
certainty
because
we
can
never
quite
accurately
know
the
whole
truth
about
the
life
of
another
i
have
known
several
men
of
action
almost
entirely
devoid
of
intellectual
culture
who
enjoyed
an
unbroken
flow
of
animal
energy
and
were
clearly
free
from
the
melancholy
of
dürer
but
i
never
intimately
knew
a
really
cultivated
person
who
had
not
suffered
from
it
more
or
less
and
the
greatest
sufferers
were
the
most
conscientious
thinkers
and
students
amongst
the
illustrious
dead
it
may
be
very
safely
answered
that
any
poet
who
has
described
it
has
written
from
his
own
experience
a
transient
experience
it
may
be
yet
his
own
when
walter
scott
of
dryden
spoke
of
the
apparently
causeless
fluctuation
of
spirits
incident
to
one
doomed
to
labor
incessantly
in
the
feverish
exercise
of
the
imagination
and
of
that
sinking
of
spirit
which
follows
violent
mental
exertion
is
it
not
evident
that
his
kindly
understanding
of
dryden
case
came
from
the
sympathy
of
a
who
knew
by
his
own
experience
the
gloomier
and
more
depressing
passages
of
the
imaginative
life
it
would
be
prudent
perhaps
to
omit
the
mention
of
byron
because
some
may
attribute
his
sadness
to
his
immorality
and
if
i
spoke
of
shelley
they
might
answer
that
he
was
sad
because
he
was
impious
but
the
truth
is
that
quite
independently
of
conduct
and
even
of
belief
it
was
scarcely
possible
for
natures
so
highly
imaginative
as
these
two
and
so
ethereally
intellectual
as
one
of
the
two
to
escape
those
clouds
of
gloom
which
darken
the
intellectual
life
wordsworth
was
not
immoral
wordsworth
was
not
unorthodox
yet
he
could
be
as
sad
in
his
own
sober
way
as
byron
in
the
bitterness
of
his
desolation
or
shelley
in
his
tenderest
wailing
the
three
men
who
seem
to
have
been
the
least
subject
to
the
sadness
of
intellectual
workers
were
alexander
humboldt
cuvier
and
goethe
alexander
humboldt
so
far
as
is
known
to
us
lived
always
in
a
clear
and
cheerful
daylight
his
appetite
for
learning
was
both
strong
and
regular
he
embraced
the
intellectual
life
in
his
earliest
manhood
and
lived
in
it
with
an
unhesitating
singleness
of
purpose
to
the
limits
of
extreme
old
age
cuvier
was
to
the
last
a
model
student
of
a
temper
at
once
most
unflinching
and
most
kind
happy
in
all
his
studies
happier
still
in
his
unequalled
facility
of
mental
goethe
as
all
know
lived
a
life
of
unflagging
interest
in
each
of
the
three
great
branches
of
intellectual
labor
during
the
whole
of
his
long
life
he
was
interested
in
literature
in
which
he
was
a
master
he
was
interested
in
science
in
which
he
was
a
discoverer
and
in
art
of
which
he
was
an
ardent
though
not
practically
successful
student
his
intellectual
activity
ceased
only
on
rare
occasions
of
painful
illness
or
overwhelming
affliction
he
does
not
seem
to
have
asked
himself
ever
whether
knowledge
was
worth
its
cost
he
was
always
ready
to
pay
the
appointed
price
of
toil
he
had
no
infirmity
of
intellectual
doubt
the
powerful
impulses
from
within
assured
him
that
knowledge
was
good
for
him
and
he
went
to
it
urged
by
an
unerring
instinct
as
a
young
salmon
bred
in
the
slime
of
a
river
seeks
strength
in
the
infinite
sea
and
yet
being
a
poet
and
a
man
of
strong
passions
goethe
did
not
altogether
escape
the
which
afflicts
the
imaginative
temperament
or
he
could
never
have
written
werther
but
he
cured
himself
very
soon
and
the
author
of
werther
had
no
indulgence
for
wertherism
indeed
we
are
told
that
he
grew
ashamed
of
having
written
the
book
which
inoculated
the
younger
minds
of
europe
with
that
miserable
disease
in
our
own
time
an
illustrious
poet
has
given
in
maud
a
very
perfect
study
of
a
young
mind
in
a
morbid
condition
a
mind
having
indeed
the
but
of
a
bad
kind
that
which
comes
not
from
the
genuine
love
of
study
but
from
sulky
rage
against
the
world
thanks
for
the
fiend
best
knows
whether
woman
or
man
be
the
worse
will
bury
myself
in
my
and
the
devil
may
pipe
to
his
own
this
kind
of
in
one
library
does
not
come
from
the
love
of
literature
the
recluse
will
not
speak
to
his
neighbor
yet
needs
human
intercourse
of
some
kind
and
seeks
it
in
reading
urged
by
an
inward
necessity
he
feels
no
gratitude
towards
the
winners
of
knowledge
his
morbid
depreciates
the
intellectual
laborers
the
man
of
science
himself
is
fonder
of
glory
and
vain
an
eye
in
nature
a
spirit
bounded
and
poor
what
is
the
life
such
a
spirit
will
choose
for
itself
despising
alike
the
ignorant
and
the
learned
the
acuteness
of
the
cultivated
and
the
simplicity
of
the
poor
in
what
form
of
activity
or
inaction
will
he
seek
what
all
men
need
the
harmony
of
a
life
well
tuned
be
mine
a
philosopher
life
in
the
quiet
woodland
ways
where
if
i
can
not
be
gay
let
a
passionless
peace
be
my
lot
there
are
many
different
morbid
states
of
the
mind
and
this
of
the
hero
of
maud
is
only
one
of
them
but
it
is
the
commonest
amongst
intellectual
or
young
men
see
how
he
has
a
little
fit
of
momentary
enthusiasm
all
he
is
capable
of
about
a
shell
that
suddenly
and
accidentally
attracts
his
attention
how
true
to
the
morbid
nature
is
that
incident
unable
to
pursue
any
large
and
systematic
observation
the
diseased
mind
is
attracted
to
things
suddenly
and
accidentally
sees
them
out
of
all
proportion
and
then
falls
into
the
inevitable
fit
of
scornful
peevishness
what
is
it
a
learned
man
could
give
it
a
clumsy
name
let
him
name
it
who
can
the
question
which
concerns
the
world
is
how
this
condition
of
the
mind
may
be
avoided
the
cure
tennyson
suggested
was
war
but
wars
though
more
frequent
than
is
desirable
are
not
to
be
had
always
and
in
your
case
my
friend
it
is
happily
not
a
cure
but
a
preventive
that
is
needed
let
me
recommend
certain
precautions
which
taken
together
are
likely
to
keep
you
safe
care
for
the
physical
health
in
the
first
place
for
if
there
is
a
morbid
mind
the
bodily
organs
are
not
doing
their
work
as
they
ought
to
do
next
for
the
mind
itself
i
would
heartily
recommend
hard
study
really
hard
study
taken
very
regularly
but
in
very
moderate
quantity
the
effect
of
it
on
the
mind
is
as
bracing
as
that
of
cold
water
on
the
body
but
as
you
ought
not
to
remain
too
long
in
the
cold
bath
so
it
is
dangerous
to
study
more
than
a
short
time
every
day
do
some
work
that
is
very
difficult
such
as
reading
some
language
that
you
have
to
puzzle
out
coups
de
two
hours
a
day
regularly
to
brace
the
fighting
power
of
the
intellect
but
let
the
rest
of
the
day
work
be
easier
acquire
especially
if
you
possibly
can
the
enviable
faculty
of
getting
entirely
rid
of
your
work
in
the
intervals
of
it
and
of
taking
a
hearty
interest
in
common
things
in
a
garden
or
stable
or
or
farm
if
the
work
pursues
you
if
what
is
called
unconscious
cerebration
which
ought
to
go
forward
without
your
knowing
it
becomes
conscious
cerebration
and
bothers
you
then
you
have
been
working
beyond
your
cerebral
strength
and
you
are
not
safe
an
organization
which
was
intended
by
nature
for
the
intellectual
life
can
not
be
healthy
and
happy
without
a
certain
degree
of
intellectual
activity
natures
like
those
of
humboldt
and
goethe
need
immense
labors
for
their
own
felicity
smaller
powers
need
less
extensive
labor
to
all
of
us
who
have
intellectual
needs
there
is
a
certain
supply
of
work
necessary
to
perfect
health
if
we
do
less
we
are
in
danger
of
that
ennui
which
comes
from
want
of
intellectual
exercise
if
we
do
more
we
may
suffer
from
that
other
ennui
which
is
due
to
the
weariness
of
the
jaded
faculties
and
this
is
the
more
terrible
of
the
two
letter
iii
to
an
intellectual
man
who
desired
an
outlet
for
his
energies
dissatisfaction
of
the
intellectual
when
they
have
not
an
extensive
influence
a
consideration
suggested
to
the
author
by
matthew
arnold
each
individual
mind
a
portion
of
the
national
mind
which
must
rise
or
decline
with
the
minds
of
which
it
is
composed
influence
of
a
townsman
in
his
town
household
influence
charities
and
condescendences
of
the
highly
cultivated
a
suggestion
of
taine
conversation
with
inferiors
how
to
make
it
interesting
that
we
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
humble
results
and
small
successes
there
is
a
very
marked
tendency
amongst
persons
of
culture
to
feel
dissatisfied
with
themselves
and
their
success
in
life
when
they
do
not
exercise
some
direct
and
visible
influence
over
a
considerable
portion
of
the
public
to
put
the
case
in
a
more
concrete
form
it
may
be
affirmed
that
if
an
intellectual
young
man
does
not
exercise
influence
by
literature
or
by
oratory
or
by
one
of
the
most
elevated
forms
of
art
he
is
apt
to
think
that
his
culture
and
intelligence
are
lost
upon
the
world
and
either
to
blame
himself
for
being
what
he
considers
a
failure
or
else
and
this
is
more
common
to
find
fault
with
the
world
in
general
for
not
giving
him
a
proper
chance
of
making
his
abilities
tell
the
facilities
for
obtaining
culture
are
now
so
many
and
great
and
within
the
reach
of
so
many
people
that
hundreds
of
persons
become
really
very
clever
in
various
ways
who
would
have
remained
utterly
uncultivated
had
they
lived
in
any
previous
century
a
few
of
these
distinguish
themselves
in
literature
and
other
pursuits
which
bring
notoriety
to
the
successful
but
by
far
the
greater
number
have
to
remain
in
positions
of
obscurity
often
being
clearly
conscious
that
they
have
abilities
and
knowledge
not
much
if
at
all
inferior
to
the
abilities
and
knowledge
of
some
who
have
achieved
distinction
the
position
of
a
clever
man
who
remains
obscure
is
if
he
has
ambition
rather
trying
to
the
moral
fibre
but
there
are
certain
considerations
which
might
help
to
give
a
direction
to
his
energy
and
so
procure
him
a
sure
relief
which
reputation
too
frequently
fails
to
provide
the
first
consideration
is
one
which
was
offered
to
me
many
years
ago
by
matthew
arnold
and
which
i
can
give
though
from
memory
very
nearly
in
his
own
words
the
multiplicity
of
things
which
make
claim
to
the
attention
of
the
public
is
in
these
days
such
that
it
requires
either
uncommon
strength
of
will
or
else
the
force
of
peculiar
circumstances
to
make
men
follow
any
serious
study
to
good
result
and
the
great
majority
content
themselves
with
the
general
enlightenment
of
the
epoch
which
they
get
from
newspapers
and
reviews
hence
the
efforts
of
the
intellectual
produce
little
effect
and
it
requires
either
extraordinary
talent
or
extraordinary
fanaticism
to
awaken
the
serious
interest
of
any
considerable
number
of
readers
yet
in
spite
of
these
discouragements
we
ought
to
remember
that
our
labors
if
not
applauded
by
others
may
be
of
infinite
value
to
ourselves
and
also
that
beyond
this
gain
to
the
individual
his
culture
is
a
gain
to
the
nation
whether
the
nation
formally
recognizes
it
or
not
for
the
intellectual
life
of
a
nation
is
the
sum
of
the
lives
of
all
intellectual
people
belonging
to
it
and
in
this
sense
your
culture
is
a
gain
to
england
whether
england
counts
you
amongst
her
eminent
sons
or
leaves
you
forever
obscure
is
it
not
a
noble
spectacle
a
spectacle
well
worthy
of
a
highly
civilized
country
when
a
private
citizen
with
an
admirable
combination
of
patriotism
and
says
to
himself
as
he
labors
i
know
that
in
a
country
so
great
as
england
where
there
are
so
many
able
men
all
that
i
do
can
count
for
very
little
in
public
estimation
yet
i
will
endeavor
to
store
my
mind
with
knowledge
and
make
my
judgment
sure
in
order
that
the
national
mind
of
england
of
which
my
mind
is
a
minute
fraction
may
be
enlightened
by
so
much
be
it
never
so
little
i
think
the
same
noble
feeling
might
animate
a
citizen
with
reference
to
his
native
town
i
think
a
good
townsman
might
say
to
himself
our
folks
are
not
much
given
to
the
cultivation
of
their
minds
and
they
need
a
few
to
set
them
an
example
i
will
be
one
of
those
few
i
will
work
and
think
in
order
that
our
town
may
not
get
into
a
state
of
perfect
intellectual
stagnation
but
if
the
nation
or
the
city
were
too
vast
to
call
forth
any
noble
feeling
of
this
kind
surely
the
family
is
little
enough
and
near
enough
might
not
a
man
say
i
will
go
through
a
good
deal
of
intellectual
drudgery
in
order
that
my
wife
and
children
may
unconsciously
get
the
benefit
of
it
i
will
learn
facts
for
them
that
they
may
be
accurate
and
get
ideas
for
them
that
they
may
share
with
me
a
more
elevated
mental
state
i
will
do
something
towards
raising
the
tone
of
the
whole
household
the
practical
difficulty
in
all
projects
of
this
kind
is
that
the
household
does
not
care
to
be
intellectually
elevated
and
opposes
the
resistance
of
gravitation
the
household
has
its
natural
intellectual
level
and
finds
it
as
inevitably
as
water
that
is
free
cultivated
men
are
surrounded
in
their
homes
by
a
group
of
persons
wife
children
servants
who
in
their
intercourse
with
one
another
create
the
household
tone
what
is
a
single
individual
with
his
books
against
these
combined
and
active
influences
is
he
to
go
and
preach
the
gospel
of
the
intellect
in
the
kitchen
will
he
venture
to
present
intellectual
conclusions
in
the
the
kitchen
has
a
tone
of
its
own
which
all
our
efforts
can
not
elevate
and
the
has
its
own
atmosphere
an
atmosphere
unfavorable
to
severe
and
manly
thinking
you
can
not
make
cooks
intellectual
and
you
must
not
be
didactic
with
ladies
intellectual
men
always
feel
this
difficulty
and
most
commonly
keep
their
intellect
very
much
to
themselves
when
they
are
at
home
if
they
have
not
an
outlet
elsewhere
either
in
society
or
in
literature
they
grow
morbid
yet
although
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
elevate
any
human
being
above
his
own
intellectual
level
unless
he
gradually
climbs
himself
as
a
man
ascends
a
mountain
there
are
nevertheless
certain
charities
or
condescendences
of
the
highly
cultivated
which
may
be
good
for
the
lower
intelligences
that
surround
them
as
the
streams
from
the
alpine
snows
are
good
for
the
irrigation
of
the
valleys
though
the
meadows
which
they
water
must
forever
remain
eight
or
ten
thousand
feet
below
them
and
i
believe
that
it
would
greatly
add
to
the
happiness
of
the
intellectual
portion
of
mankind
if
they
could
more
systematically
exercise
these
charities
it
is
quite
clear
that
we
can
never
effect
by
chance
conversation
that
total
change
in
the
mental
state
which
is
gradually
brought
about
by
the
slow
processes
of
education
we
can
not
give
to
an
intellect
that
has
never
been
developed
and
which
has
fixed
itself
in
the
undeveloped
state
that
power
and
activity
which
come
only
after
years
of
labor
but
we
may
be
able
on
many
occasions
to
offer
the
sort
of
help
which
a
gentleman
offers
to
an
old
woman
when
he
invites
her
to
get
up
into
the
rumble
behind
his
carriage
i
knew
an
intellectual
lady
who
lived
habitually
in
the
country
and
i
may
say
without
fanciful
exaggeration
that
the
farmers
wives
round
about
her
were
considerably
superior
to
what
in
all
probability
they
would
have
been
without
the
advantage
of
her
kindly
and
instructive
conversation
she
possessed
the
happy
art
of
conveying
the
sort
of
knowledge
which
could
be
readily
received
by
her
hearers
and
in
a
manner
which
made
it
agreeable
to
them
so
that
they
drew
ideas
from
her
quite
naturally
and
her
mind
irrigated
their
minds
which
would
have
remained
permanently
barren
without
that
help
and
refreshment
it
would
be
foolish
to
exaggerate
the
benefits
of
such
intellectual
charity
as
this
but
it
is
well
on
the
other
hand
not
to
undervalue
it
such
an
influence
can
never
convey
much
solid
instruction
but
it
may
convey
some
of
its
results
it
may
produce
a
more
thoughtful
and
reasonable
condition
of
mind
it
may
preserve
the
ignorant
from
some
of
those
preposterous
theories
and
beliefs
which
so
easily
gain
currency
amongst
them
indirectly
it
may
have
rather
an
important
political
influence
by
disposing
people
to
vote
for
the
better
sort
of
candidate
and
the
influence
of
such
intellectual
charity
on
the
material
well
being
of
the
humbler
classes
on
their
health
and
wealth
may
be
quite
as
considerable
as
that
of
the
other
and
more
common
sort
of
charity
which
passes
silver
from
hand
to
hand
shortly
after
the
termination
of
the
great
conflict
taine
suggested
in
the
that
subscribers
to
the
better
sort
of
journals
might
do
a
good
deal
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
humbler
classes
by
merely
lending
their
newspapers
in
their
neighborhood
this
was
a
good
suggestion
the
best
newspapers
are
an
important
intellectual
propaganda
they
awaken
an
interest
in
the
most
various
subjects
and
supply
not
only
information
but
a
stimulus
the
danger
to
persons
of
higher
culture
that
the
newspaper
may
absorb
time
which
would
else
be
devoted
to
more
systematic
study
does
not
exist
in
the
classes
for
whose
benefit
taine
made
his
recommendation
the
newspaper
is
their
only
secular
reading
and
without
it
they
have
no
modern
literature
of
any
kind
in
addition
to
the
praiseworthy
habit
of
lending
good
newspapers
an
intellectual
man
who
lives
in
the
country
might
adopt
the
practice
of
conversing
with
his
neighbors
about
everything
in
which
they
could
be
induced
to
take
an
interest
giving
them
some
notion
of
what
goes
on
in
the
classes
which
are
intellectually
active
some
idea
of
such
discoveries
and
projects
as
an
untutored
mind
may
partially
understand
for
example
there
is
the
great
tunnel
under
the
mont
cenis
and
there
is
the
projected
tunnel
beneath
the
channel
and
there
is
the
cutting
of
the
isthmus
of
suez
a
peasant
can
comprehend
the
greatness
of
these
remarkable
conceptions
when
they
are
properly
explained
to
him
and
he
will
often
feel
a
lively
gratitude
for
information
of
that
kind
we
ought
to
remember
what
a
slow
and
painful
operation
reading
is
to
the
uneducated
merely
to
read
the
native
tongue
is
to
them
a
labor
so
irksome
that
they
are
apt
to
lose
the
sense
of
a
paragraph
in
seeking
for
that
of
a
sentence
or
an
expression
as
they
would
rather
speak
than
have
to
write
so
they
prefer
hearing
to
reading
and
they
get
much
more
good
from
it
because
they
can
ask
a
question
when
the
matter
has
not
been
made
clear
to
them
one
of
the
best
ways
of
interesting
and
instructing
your
intellectual
inferiors
is
to
give
them
an
account
of
your
travels
all
people
like
to
hear
a
traveller
tell
his
own
tale
and
whilst
he
is
telling
it
he
may
slip
in
a
good
deal
of
information
about
many
things
and
much
sound
doctrine
accounts
of
foreign
countries
even
when
you
have
not
seen
them
personally
nearly
always
awaken
a
lively
interest
especially
if
you
are
able
to
give
your
hearers
detailed
descriptions
of
the
life
led
by
foreigners
who
occupy
positions
corresponding
to
their
own
peasants
can
be
made
to
take
an
interest
in
astronomy
even
though
you
can
not
tell
them
anything
about
the
peasants
in
jupiter
and
mars
and
there
is
always
at
starting
the
great
difficulty
of
persuading
them
to
trust
science
about
the
motion
and
rotundity
of
the
earth
a
very
direct
form
of
intellectual
charity
is
that
of
gratuitous
teaching
both
in
classes
and
by
public
lectures
open
to
all
comers
a
great
deal
of
light
has
in
this
way
been
spread
abroad
in
cities
but
in
country
villages
there
is
little
encouragement
to
enterprises
of
this
kind
the
intelligence
of
farm
laborers
being
less
awakened
than
that
of
the
corresponding
urban
population
let
us
remember
however
that
one
of
the
very
highest
and
last
achievements
of
the
cultivated
intellect
is
the
art
of
conveying
to
the
uncultivated
the
untaught
the
unprepared
the
best
and
noblest
knowledge
which
they
are
capable
of
assimilating
no
one
who
like
the
writer
of
these
pages
has
lived
much
in
the
country
and
much
amongst
a
densely
ignorant
peasantry
will
be
likely
in
any
plans
of
enlightenment
to
err
far
on
the
side
of
enthusiastic
hopefulness
the
mind
of
a
farm
laborer
or
that
of
a
small
farmer
is
almost
always
sure
to
be
a
remarkably
stiff
soil
in
which
few
intellectual
conceptions
can
take
root
yet
these
few
may
make
the
difference
between
an
existence
worthy
of
a
man
and
one
that
differs
from
the
existence
of
a
brute
in
little
beyond
the
possession
of
articulate
language
we
to
whom
the
rich
inheritance
of
intellectual
humanity
is
so
familiar
as
to
have
lost
much
of
its
freshness
are
liable
to
underrate
the
value
of
thoughts
and
discoveries
which
to
us
have
for
years
seemed
commonplace
it
is
with
our
intellectual
as
with
our
material
wealth
we
do
not
realize
how
precious
some
fragments
of
it
might
be
to
our
poorer
neighbors
the
old
clothes
that
we
wear
no
longer
may
give
comfort
and
confidence
to
a
man
in
naked
destitution
the
truths
which
are
so
familiar
to
us
that
we
never
think
about
them
may
raise
the
utterly
ignorant
to
a
sense
of
their
human
brotherhood
above
all
in
the
exercise
of
our
intellectual
charities
let
us
accustom
ourselves
to
feel
satisfied
with
humble
results
and
small
successes
and
here
let
me
make
a
confession
which
may
be
of
some
possible
use
to
others
when
a
young
man
i
taught
a
gratuitously
beginning
with
pupils
who
dwindled
gradually
to
eleven
soon
afterwards
i
gave
up
the
work
from
dissatisfaction
on
account
of
the
meagre
attendance
this
was
very
wrong
the
eleven
were
worth
the
and
so
long
as
one
of
the
eleven
remained
i
ought
to
have
contentedly
taught
him
the
success
of
a
teacher
is
not
to
be
measured
by
the
numbers
whom
he
immediately
influences
it
is
enough
it
has
been
proved
to
be
enough
in
more
than
one
remarkable
instance
that
a
single
living
soul
should
be
in
unison
with
the
soul
of
a
master
and
receive
his
thought
by
sympathy
the
one
disciple
teaches
in
his
turn
and
the
idea
is
propagated
letter
iv
to
the
friend
of
a
man
of
high
culture
who
produced
nothing
joubert
not
yet
time
or
else
the
time
is
past
his
weakness
for
production
three
classes
of
minds
a
more
perfect
intellectual
life
attainable
by
the
silent
student
than
by
authors
he
may
follow
his
own
genius
saving
of
time
effected
by
abstinence
from
writing
the
unproductive
may
be
more
influential
than
the
prolific
when
i
met
at
your
house
last
week
you
whispered
to
me
in
the
that
he
was
a
man
of
the
most
remarkable
attainments
who
to
the
great
regret
of
all
his
friends
had
never
employed
his
abilities
to
any
visible
purpose
we
had
not
time
for
a
conversation
on
this
subject
because
himself
immediately
joined
us
his
talk
reminded
me
very
much
of
joubert
not
that
i
ever
knew
joubert
personally
though
i
have
lived
very
near
to
where
joubert
lived
but
he
is
one
of
those
characters
whom
it
is
possible
to
know
without
having
seen
them
in
the
flesh
his
friends
used
to
urge
him
to
write
something
and
then
he
said
not
yet
i
need
a
long
peace
tranquillity
came
and
then
he
said
that
god
had
only
given
force
to
his
mind
for
a
limited
time
and
that
the
time
was
past
therefore
as
observed
for
joubert
there
was
no
medium
either
it
was
not
yet
time
or
else
the
time
was
past
nothing
is
more
common
than
for
people
to
say
this
of
us
they
often
say
he
is
too
young
as
napoleon
said
of
ingres
or
else
he
is
too
old
as
napoleon
said
of
greuze
it
is
more
rare
for
a
man
himself
to
shrink
from
every
enterprise
first
under
the
persuasion
that
he
is
unprepared
and
afterwards
because
the
time
is
no
longer
opportune
yet
there
does
exist
a
certain
very
peculiar
class
of
diffident
delicate
unproductive
minds
which
impress
those
around
them
with
an
almost
superstitious
belief
in
their
possibilities
yet
never
do
anything
to
justify
that
belief
but
may
it
not
be
doubted
whether
these
minds
productive
power
of
any
kind
i
believe
that
the
full
extent
of
joubert
productive
power
is
displayed
in
those
sentences
of
his
which
have
been
preserved
and
which
reveal
a
genius
of
the
rarest
delicacy
but
at
the
same
time
singularly
incapable
of
sustained
intellectual
effort
he
said
that
he
could
only
compose
slowly
and
with
an
extreme
fatigue
he
believed
however
that
the
weakness
lay
in
the
instrument
alone
in
the
composing
faculties
and
not
in
the
faculties
of
thought
for
he
said
that
behind
his
weakness
there
was
strength
as
behind
the
strength
of
some
others
there
was
weakness
in
saying
this
it
is
probable
that
joubert
did
not
overestimate
himself
he
strength
of
a
certain
kind
or
rather
he
had
quality
he
had
distinction
which
is
a
sort
of
strength
in
society
and
in
literature
but
he
had
no
productive
force
and
i
do
not
believe
that
his
unproductiveness
was
a
productiveness
checked
by
a
fastidious
taste
i
believe
that
it
was
real
that
he
was
not
organized
for
production
said
that
a
modern
philosopher
was
accustomed
to
distinguish
three
classes
of
minds
those
who
are
at
once
powerful
and
delicate
who
excel
as
they
propose
execute
what
they
conceive
and
reach
the
great
and
true
beautiful
a
rare
amongst
mortals
a
class
of
minds
especially
characterized
by
their
delicacy
who
feel
that
their
idea
is
superior
to
their
execution
their
intelligence
greater
than
their
talent
even
when
the
talent
is
very
real
they
are
easily
dissatisfied
with
themselves
disdain
easily
won
praises
and
would
rather
judge
taste
and
abstain
from
producing
than
remain
below
their
conception
and
themselves
or
if
they
write
it
is
by
fragments
for
themselves
only
at
long
intervals
and
at
rare
moments
their
fecundity
is
internal
and
known
to
few
lastly
there
is
a
third
class
of
minds
more
powerful
and
less
delicate
or
difficult
to
please
who
go
on
producing
and
publishing
themselves
without
being
too
much
dissatisfied
with
their
work
the
majority
of
our
active
painters
and
writers
who
fill
modern
exhibitions
and
produce
the
current
literature
of
the
day
belong
to
the
last
class
to
which
we
are
all
greatly
indebted
for
the
daily
bread
of
literature
and
art
but
believed
that
joubert
belonged
to
the
second
class
and
i
suspect
that
both
and
many
others
have
credited
that
class
with
a
potential
productiveness
beyond
its
real
endowments
minds
of
the
joubert
class
are
admirable
and
valuable
in
their
way
but
they
are
really
and
not
apparently
sterile
and
why
would
we
have
it
otherwise
when
we
lament
that
a
man
of
culture
has
done
nothing
as
we
say
we
mean
that
he
has
not
written
books
is
it
necessary
is
it
desirable
that
every
cultivated
person
should
write
books
on
the
contrary
it
seems
that
a
more
perfect
intellectual
life
may
be
attained
by
the
silent
student
than
by
authors
the
writer
for
the
public
is
often
so
far
its
slave
that
he
is
compelled
by
necessity
or
induced
by
the
desire
for
success
since
it
is
humiliating
to
write
unsaleable
books
as
well
as
unprofitable
to
deviate
from
his
true
path
to
leave
the
subjects
that
most
interest
him
for
other
subjects
which
interest
him
less
and
therefore
to
acquire
knowledge
rather
as
a
matter
of
business
than
as
a
labor
of
love
but
the
student
who
never
publishes
and
does
not
intend
to
publish
may
follow
his
own
genius
and
take
the
knowledge
which
belongs
to
him
by
natural
affinity
add
to
this
the
immense
saving
of
time
effected
by
abstinence
from
writing
whilst
the
writer
is
polishing
his
periods
and
giving
hours
to
the
artistic
exigencies
of
mere
form
the
reader
is
adding
to
his
knowledge
thackeray
said
that
writers
were
not
great
readers
because
they
had
not
the
time
the
most
studious
frenchman
i
ever
met
with
used
to
say
that
he
so
hated
the
pen
as
scarcely
to
resolve
to
write
a
letter
he
reminded
me
of
joubert
in
this
he
often
said
horreur
de
la
plume
since
he
had
no
profession
his
leisure
was
unlimited
and
he
employed
it
in
educating
himself
without
any
other
purpose
than
this
the
highest
purpose
of
all
to
become
a
cultivated
man
the
very
prevalent
idea
that
lives
of
this
kind
are
failures
unless
they
leave
some
visible
achievement
as
a
testimony
and
justification
of
their
labors
is
based
upon
a
narrow
conception
both
of
duty
and
of
utility
men
of
this
unproductive
class
are
sure
to
influence
their
immediate
neighborhood
by
the
example
of
their
life
isolated
as
they
are
too
frequently
in
the
provinces
in
the
midst
of
populations
destitute
of
the
higher
culture
they
often
establish
the
notion
of
it
notwithstanding
the
contemptuous
estimates
of
the
practical
people
around
them
a
single
intellectual
life
thus
modestly
lived
through
in
the
obscurity
of
a
may
leave
a
tradition
and
become
an
enduring
influence
in
this
as
in
all
things
let
us
trust
the
arrangements
of
nature
if
men
are
at
the
same
time
constitutionally
studious
and
constitutionally
unproductive
in
must
be
that
production
is
not
the
only
use
of
study
joubert
was
right
in
keeping
silence
when
he
felt
no
impulses
to
speak
right
also
in
saying
the
little
that
he
did
say
without
a
superfluous
word
his
mind
is
more
fully
known
and
more
influential
than

are

productive

in

to
you
on

of
work
i
did
not
give
much
consideration
to
another
matter
which
in
certain
kinds
of
work
has
to
be
taken
into
account
for
i
preferred
to
make
that
the
subject
of
a
separate
letter
there
are
certain
intellectual
products
which
are
only
possible
in
hours
or
minutes
of
great
cerebral
excitement
byron
said
that
when
people
were
surprised
to
find
poets
very
much
like
others
in
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
life
their
surprise
was
due
to
ignorance
of
this
if
people
knew
byron
said
that
poetical
production
came
from
an
excitement
which
from
its
intensity
could
only
be
temporary
they
would
not
expect
poets
to
be
very
different
from
other
people
when
not
under
the
influence
of
this
excitement
now
we
may
take
the
word
poet
in
this
connection
in
the
very
largest
sense
all
men
who
have
the
gift
of
invention
are
poets
the
inventive
ideas
come
to
them
at
unforeseen
moments
and
have
to
be
seized
when
they
come
so
that
the
true
inventor
works
sometimes
with
vertiginous
rapidity
and
afterwards
remains
for
days
or
weeks
without
exercising
the
inventive
faculty
at
all
the
question
is
can
you
make
an
inventive
mind
work
on
the
principle
of
measured
and
regular
advance
is
such
counsel
as
that
in
my
former
letter
applicable
to
inventors
scott
said
that
although
he
had
known
many
men
of
ordinary
abilities
who
were
capable
of
perfect
regularity
in
their
habits
he
had
never
known
a
man
of
genius
who
was
so
the
popular
impression
concerning
men
of
genius
is
very
strong
in
the
same
sense
but
it
is
well
not
to
attach
too
much
importance
to
popular
impressions
concerning
men
of
genius
for
the
obvious
reason
that
such
men
come
very
little
under
popular
observation
when
they
work
it
is
usually
in
the
most
perfect
solitude
and
even
people
who
live
in
the
same
house
know
very
little
really
of
their
intellectual
habits
the
truth
seems
to
be
first
that
the
moments
of
high
excitement
of
noblest
invention
are
rare
and
not
to
be
commanded
by
the
will
but
on
the
other
hand
that
in
order
to
make
the
gift
of
invention
produce
its
full
effect
in
any
department
of
human
effort
vast
labors
of
preparation
are
necessary
and
these
labors
may
be
pursued
as
steadily
as
you
like
napoleon
used
to
say
that
battles
were
won
by
the
sudden
flashing
of
an
idea
through
the
brain
of
the
commander
at
a
certain
critical
instant
the
capacity
for
generating
this
sudden
electric
spark
was
military
genius
the
spark
flashed
independently
of
the
will
the
general
could
not
win
that
vivid
illumination
by
labor
or
by
prayer
it
came
only
in
the
brain
of
genius
from
the
intense
anxiety
and
excitement
of
the
actual
conflict
napoleon
seems
always
to
have
counted
upon
it
always
to
have
believed
that
when
the
critical
instant
arrived
the
wild
confusion
of
the
would
be
illuminated
for
him
by
that
burst
of
sudden
flame
but
if
napoleon
had
been
ignorant
of
the
prosaic
business
of
his
profession
to
which
he
attended
more
closely
than
any
other
commander
what
would
these
moments
of
supreme
clearness
have
availed
him
or
would
they
ever
have
come
to
him
at
all
if
they
had
come
to
him
they
would
have
revealed
only
the
extent
of
his
own
negligence
instead
of
showing
him
to
they
would
have
made
painfully
evident
what
to
have
been
but
it
is
more
probable
that
these
clear
moments
would
never
have
occurred
to
a
mind
unprepared
by
study
clear
military
inspirations
never
occur
to
shopkeepers
and
farmers
as
bright
ideas
about
checkmates
occur
only
to
persons
who
have
studied
chess
the
prosaic
business
then
of
the
man
of
genius
is
to
accumulate
that
preparatory
knowledge
without
which
his
genius
can
never
be
available
and
he
can
do
work
of
this
kind
as
regularly
as
he
likes
the
one
fatal
mistake
which
is
committed
habitually
by
people
who
have
the
scarcely
desirable
gift
of
is
waiting
for
inspiration
they
pass
week
after
week
in
a
state
of
indolence
unprofitable
alike
to
the
mind
and
the
purse
under
pretext
of
waiting
for
intellectual
flashes
like
those
which
came
to
napoleon
on
his
they
ought
to
remember
the
advice
given
by
one
of
the
greatest
artists
of
the
seventeenth
century
to
a
young
painter
of
his
acquaintance
practise
assiduously
what
you
already
know
and
in
course
of
time
other
things
will
become
clear
to
you
the
inspirations
come
only
to
the
disciplined
the
indolent
wait
for
them
in
vain
if
you
have
genius
therefore
or
believe
you
have
it
is
admitted
that
you
can
not
be
perpetually
in
a
state
of
intense
excitement
if
you
were
in
that
state
without
ceasing
you
would
go
mad
you
can
not
be
expected
to
write
poetry
in
the
plodding
manner
advocated
for
intellectual
work
generally
in
my
last
letter
as
for
that
good
old
comparison
between
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
it
may
be
answered
for
you
simply
that
you
are
not
a
tortoise
and
that
what
is
a
most
wise
procedure
for
tortoises
may
be
impracticable
for
you
the
actual
composition
of
poetry
especially
poetry
of
a
fiery
kind
like
the
isles
of
greece
the
isles
of
greece
of
byron
is
to
be
done
not
when
the
poet
will
but
when
he
can
or
rather
when
he
but
if
you
are
a
wise
genius
you
will
feel
how
necessary
is
culture
even
for
work
of
that
kind
byron
would
not
have
felt
any
enthusiasm
for
the
isles
of
greece
if
he
had
not
known
something
of
their
history
the
verses
are
an
inspiration
but
they
could
never
have
occurred
to
a
quite
uncultivated
person
however
bright
his
inspirations
even
more
obviously
was
the
genius
of
keats
dependent
upon
his
culture
he
did
not
read
greek
but
from
translations
of
greek
literature
and
from
the
direct
study
of
greek
art
he
got
the
sort
of
material
that
he
needed
and
in
our
own
day
morris
has
been
evidently
a
very
diligent
student
of
many
literatures
what
i
insist
upon
is
that
we
could
not
have
had
the
real
keats
the
real
morris
unless
they
had
prepared
themselves
by
culture
we
see
immediately
that
the
work
they
have
done
is
work
specially
that
they
were
specially
adapted
for
it
inspired
for
it
if
you
will
but
how
evident
it
is
that
the
inspiration
could
never
have
produced
the
work
or
anything
like
it
without
labor
in
the
accumulation
of
material
now
although
men
of
genius
can
not
be
regularly
progressive
in
actual
production
can
not
write
so
many
verses
a
day
regularly
as
you
may
spin
yarn
they
can
be
very
regular
as
students
and
some
of
the
best
of
them
have
been
quite
remarkable
for
unflinching
steadiness
of
application
in
that
way
the
great
principle
recommended
by
galton
of
not
looking
forward
eagerly
to
the
end
of
your
journey
but
interesting
yourself
chiefly
in
the
progress
of
it
is
as
applicable
to
the
studies
of
men
of
genius
as
to
those
of
more
ordinary
persons
letter
vi
to
an
ardent
friend
who
took
no
rest
on
some
verses
of
goethe

not
constituted
like
a

thankful
rambling
over
the
wild
moors
with
thoughts
oftentimes
as
wild
and
dreary
as
those
moors
the
young
carlyle
who
had
been
cheered
through
his
struggling
sadness
and
strengthened
for
the
part
he
was
to
play
in
life
by
the
beauty
and
the
wisdom
which
goethe
had
revealed
to
him
suddenly
conceived
the
idea
that
it
would
be
a
pleasant
and
a
fitting
thing
if
some
of
the
few
admirers
in
england
forwarded
to
weimar
a
trifling
token
of
their
admiration
on
reaching
home
carlyle
at
once
sketched
the
design
of
a
seal
to
be
engraved
the
serpent
of
eternity
encircling
a
star
with
the
words
hast
ohne
unhasting
unresting
in
allusion
to
the
verses
das

hast
aber
ohne
rast
drehe
sich
jeder
um
die
eigne
last
like
a
star
unhasting
unresting
be
each
one
fulfilling
his
this
is
said
so
beautifully
and
seems
so
wise
that
it
may
easily
settle
down
into
the
mind
as
a
maxim
and
rule
of
life
had
we
been
told
in
plain
prose
to
take
no
rest
without
the
beautiful
simile
of
the
star
and
without
the
wise
restriction
about
haste
our
common
sense
would
have
rebelled
at
once
but
as
both
beauty
and
wisdom
exist
together
in
the
stanza
our
judgment
remains
silent
in
charmed
acquiescence
let
us
ask
ourselves
however
about
this
stella
example
whether
man
is
naturally
so
constituted
as
to
be
able
to
imitate
it
a
planet
moves
without
haste
because
it
is
incapable
of
excitement
and
without
rest
because
it
is
incapable
of
fatigue
a
planet
makes
no
effort
and
encounters
no
friction
or
resistance
of
any
kind
man
is
so
constituted
as
to
feel
frequently
the
stimulus
of
excitement
which
immediately
translates
itself
either
into
actual
acceleration
or
into
the
desire
for
acceleration
a
desire
which
can
not
be
restrained
without
an
effort
and
whatever
man
undertakes
to
do
he
encounters
friction
and
resistance
which
for
him
always
sooner
or
later
inevitably
induce
fatigue
man
is
neither
constituted
like
a
star
nor
situated
like
a
star
and
therefore
it
is
not
possible
for
him
to
exist
as
stars
exist
you
will
object
to
this
criticism
that
it
handles
a
delicate
little
poem
very
roughly
and
you
may
tell
me
that
i
am
unfit
to
receive
the
wisdom
of
the
poets
which
is
always
uttered
with
a
touch
of
oriental
exaggeration
certainly
goethe
could
never
mean
that
a
man
should
kill
himself
by
labors
literally
incessant
goethe
own
life
is
the
best
elucidation
of
his
true
meaning
the
example
of
the
star
was
held
up
to
us
to
be
followed
only
within
the
limits
of
our
human
nature
as
a
christian
points
to
the
example
of
christ
in
the
same
spirit
matthew
arnold
wrote
his
noble
poem
in
which
he
tells
us
to
live
like
the
stars
and
the
sea
ah
once
more
i
cried
ye
stars
ye
waters
on
my
heart
your
mighty
charm
renew
still
still
let
me
as
i
gaze
upon
you
feel
my
soul
becoming
vast
like
you
from
the
intense
clear
vault
of
heaven
over
the
lit
sea
unquiet
way
in
the
rustling
came
the
answer
wouldst
thou
as
these
are
as
they
unaffrighted
by
the
silence
round
them
undistracted
by
the
sights
they
see
these
demand
not
that
the
things
without
them
yield
them
love
amusement
sympathy
the
true
intention
of
poetical
teachings
like
these
is
in
the
influence
they
have
over
the
feelings
if
a
star
makes
me
steadier
in
my
labor
less
of
a
victim
to
vain
agitation
in
consequence
of
goethe
verses
if
the
stars
and
the
sea
together
renew
more
fully
their
mighty
charm
upon
my
heart
because
those
stanzas
of
arnold
have
fixed
themselves
in
my
memory
the
poets
have
done
their
work
but
the
more
positive
has
his
work
to
do
also
and
you
as
it
seems
to
me
need
this
positive
help
of
prose
you
are
living
a
great
deal
too
much
like
a
star
and
not
enough
like
a
human
being
you
do
not
hasten
often
but
you
rest
except
when
nature
mercifully
prostrates
you
in
irresistible
sleep
like
the
stars
and
the
sea
in
arnold
poem
you
do
not
ask
surrounding
things
to
yield
you
love
amusement
sympathy
the
stars
and
the
sea
can
do
without
these
refreshments
of
the
brain
and
heart
but
you
can
not
rest
is
necessary
to
recruit
your
intellectual
forces
sympathy
is
necessary
to
prevent
your
whole
nature
from
stiffening
like
a
rotifer
without
moisture
love
is
necessary
to
make
life
beautiful
for
you
as
the
plumage
of
certain
birds
becomes
splendid
when
they
pair
and
without
amusement
you
will
lose
the
gayety
which
wise
men
try
to
keep
as
the
best
legacy
of
youth
let
your
rest
be
perfect
in
its
season
like
the
rest
of
waters
that
are
still
if
you
will
have
a
model
for
your
living
take
neither
the
stars
for
they
fly
without
ceasing
nor
the
ocean
that
ebbs
and
flows
nor
the
river
that
can
not
stay
but
rather
let
your
life
be
like
that
of
the
summer
air
which
has
times
of
noble
energy
and
times
of
perfect
peace
it
fills
the
sails
of
ships
upon
the
sea
and
the
miller
thanks
it
on
the
breezy
uplands
it
works
generously
for
the
health
and
wealth
of
all
men
yet
it
claims
its
hours
of
rest
i
have
pushed
the
fleet
i
have
turned
the
mill
i
have
refreshed
the
city
and
now
though
the
captain
may
walk
impatiently
on
the
and
the
miller
swear
and
the
city
stink
i
will
stir
no
more
until
it
pleases
me
you
have
learned
many
things
my
friend
but
one
thing
you
have
learned
the
art
of
resting
that
stone
in
glen
croe
ought
to
have
impressed
its
lesson
on
the
mind
of
many
a
traveller
long
before
earl
russell
gave
it
a
newspaper
celebrity
have
we
not
rested
there
together
you
and
i
a
little
in
advance
of
the
coach
which
the
weary
horses
were
still
slowly
dragging
up
the
tedious
hill
and
as
we
sat
on
the
turf
and
looked
down
the
misty
glen
did
we
not
read
the
lesson
there
engraven
how
good
and
the
idea
was
the
idea
of
setting
up
that
graven
stone
in
the
wilderness
how
full
of
sympathy
is
that
inscription
for
all
the
weakness
and
weariness
of
humanity
once
in
the
ardor
of
youth
there
shone
before
me
a
golden
star
in
heaven
and
on
the
deep
azure
around
it
hast
ohne
in
letters
of
steady
flame
but
now
i
see
more
frequently
a
plain
little
stone
set
up
in
the
earth
with
the
inscription
rest
and
be
thankful
is
not
the
stone
just
a
little
like
a
my
friend
perhaps
it
is
but
if
we
take
rest
when
we
require
it
during
life
we
shall
not
need
the
grave
rest
quite
so
soon
letter
vii
to
an
ardent
friend
who
took
no
rest
the
regret
for
lost
time
often
a
needless
one
tillier
doctrine
about
how
much
is
gained
in
idle
hours
conviction
that
whatever
he
did
he
studied
the
infinite
book
of
the
world
and
of
life
harness
free
play
of
the
mind
necessary
the
freedom
of
a
grain
of
the
freedom
of
the
wild
bee
if
we
asked
any
intellectual
workman
what
he
would
do
if
his
life
were
to
be
lived
over
again
i
believe
the
answer
whatever
its
form
would
amount
ultimately
to
this
i
would
economize
my
time
better
very
likely
if
the
opportunity
were
granted
him
he
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
very
likely
he
would
waste
his
time
in
ways
more
authorized
by
custom
yet
waste
it
just
as
extravagantly
as
he
had
done
after
his
own
original
fashion
but
it
always
seems
to
us
as
if
we
could
use
the
time
better
if
we
had
it
over
again
it
seems
to
me
in
looking
back
over
the
last
thirty
years
that
the
only
time
really
wasted
has
been
that
spent
in
laborious
obedience
to
some
external
authority
it
may
be
a
dangerous
doctrine
which
claude
tillier
expressed
in
an
immortal
sentence
but
dangerous
or
not
it
is
full
of
intellectual
truth
le
temps
le
mieux
employé
est
celui
que
perd
if
what
we
are
accustomed
to
consider
lost
time
could
be
removed
as
to
its
effects
at
least
from
the
sum
of
our
existence
it
is
certain
that
we
should
suffer
from
a
great
intellectual
impoverishment
all
the
best
knowledge
of
mankind
to
begin
with
is
acquired
in
hours
which
people
consider
lost
hours
in
hours
that
is
of
pleasure
and
recreation
deduct
all
that
we
have
learnt
about
men
in
times
of
recreation
in
clubs
and
on
the
on
the
on
the
deck
of
the
yacht
on
the
box
of
the
drag
or
the
would
the
residue
be
worth
very
much
would
it
not
be
a
mere
heap
of
dry
bones
without
any
warm
flesh
to
cover
them
even
the
education
of
most
of
us
such
as
it
is
has
been
in
a
great
measure
acquired
out
of
school
as
it
were
i
mean
outside
of
the
acknowledged
duties
of
our
more
serious
existence
few
englishmen
past
forty
have
studied
english
literature
either
as
a
college
exercise
or
a
professional
preparation
they
have
read
it
privately
as
an
amusement
few
englishmen
past
forty
have
studied
modern
languages
or
science
or
the
fine
arts
from
any
obedience
to
duty
but
merely
from
taste
and
inclination
and
even
if
we
studied
these
things
formally
as
young
men
often
do
at
the
present
day
it
is
not
from
the
formal
study
that
we
should
get
the
of
the
language
or
the
art
but
from
idle
hours
in
foreign
lands
and
galleries
it
is
superfluous
to
recommend
idleness
to
the
unintellectual
but
the
intellectual
too
often
undervalue
it
the
laborious
intellect
contracts
a
habit
of
strenuousness
which
is
some
times
a
hindrance
to
its
best
activity
i
have
arrived
said
perhaps
by
way
of
secretly
excusing
my
own
idleness
perhaps
by
a
deeper
feeling
of
the
principle
that
all
comes
to
the
same
at
the
conclusion
that
whatever
i
do
or
do
not
working
in
the
study
at
continuous
labor
scattering
myself
in
articles
spreading
myself
about
in
society
giving
my
time
away
to
troublesome
callers
to
poor
people
to
in
the
street
no
matter
to
whom
and
to
what
i
cease
not
to
do
one
and
the
same
thing
to
read
one
and
the
same
book
the
infinite
book
of
the
world
and
of
life
that
no
one
ever
finishes
in
which
the
wisest
read
farthest
i
read
it
then
at
all
the
pages
which
present
themselves
in
broken
fragments
backwards
what
matters
it
i
never
cease
going
on
the
greater
the
medley
the
more
frequent
the
interruption
the
more
i
get
on
with
this
book
in
which
one
is
never
beyond
the
middle
but
the
profit
is
to
have
had
it
open
before
one
at
all
sorts
of
different
pages
a
distinguished
author
wrote
to
another
author
less
distinguished
you
have
gone
through
a
good
deal
of
really
vigorous
study
but
have
not
in
yet
by
harness
he
meant
discipline
settled
beforehand
like
military
drill
now
the
advantages
of
drill
are
evident
and
very
generally
recognized
but
the
advantages
of
intellectual
are
not
so
generally
recognized
for
the
work
of
the
intellect
to
be
clear
and
healthy
a
great
deal
of
free
play
of
the
mind
is
absolutely
necessary
harness
is
good
for
an
hour
or
two
at
a
time
but
the
finest
intellects
have
never
in
harness
in
reading
any
book
that
has
much
vitality
you
are
sure
to
meet

harness
trains
us
to
the
systematic
performance
of
our
work

strength

regulated
exercise
but
it
does
not
supply
everything
that
is

the

the

the
truth
is
that
we
need
both
the
discipline
of
harness
and
the
abundant
nourishment
of
the
free
pasture
yet
may
not
our
freedom
be
the
profitless
choiceless
freedom
of
a
grain
of
carried
hither
and
thither
by
the

gaining
nothing
and
improving
nothing
so
that
it
does
not
signify
where
it
was
carried
yesterday
or
where
it
may
fall

rather
the
liberty
of
the
wild
bee
whose
coming
and
going
are
ordered
by
no
master
nor
fixed
by
any
premeditated
regulation
yet
which
misses
no
opportunity
of

of
the
your
abstinence
from
newspaper
reading
is
not
anew
experiment
in
itself
though
it
is
new
in
reference
to
your
particular
case
and
i
await
its
effects
with
interest
i
shall
be
curious
to
observe
the
consequences
to
an
intellect
constituted
as
yours
is
of
that
total
cutting
off
from
the
public
interests
of
your
own
century
which
an
abstinence
from
newspapers
implies
it
is
clear
that
whatever
the
loss
may
be
you
have
a
definite
gain
to
set
against
it
the
time
which
you
have
hitherto
given
to
newspapers
and
which
may
be
roughly
estimated
at
about
five
hundred
hours
a
year
is
henceforth
a
valuable
to
be
applied
to
whatever
purposes
your
best
wisdom
may
select
when
an
intellectual
person
has
contrived
by
the
force
of
one
simple
resolution
to
effect
so
fine
an
economy
as
this
it
is
natural
that
he
should
congratulate
himself
your
feelings
must
be
like
those
of
an
able
finance
minister
who
has
found
means
of
closing
a
great
leak
in
the
treasury
if
any
economy
possible
in
the
finances
of
a
state
could
ever
relatively
equal
that
splendid
stroke
of
which
your
force
of
will
has
enabled
you
to
effect
in
those
five
hundred
hours
which
are
now
your
own
you
may
acquire
a
science
or
obtain
a
more
perfect
command
over
one
of
the
languages
which
you
have
studied
some
department
of
your
intellectual
labors
which
has
hitherto
been
unsatisfactory
to
you
because
it
was
too
imperfectly
cultivated
may
henceforth
be
as
orderly
and
as
fruitful
as
a
garden
you
may
become
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
works
of
more
than
one
great
author
whom
you
have
neglected
not
from
lack
of
interest
but
from
want
of
time
you
may
open
some
old
chamber
of
the
memory
that
has
been
dark
and
disused
for
many
a
year
you
may
clear
the
cobwebs
away
and
let
the
fresh
light
in
and
make
it
habitable
once
again
against
these
gains
of
which
some
to
a
man
of
your
industry
are
certain
and
may
be
counted
upon
what
must
be
our
estimate
of
the
amount
of
sacrifice
or
loss
it
is
clear
to
both
of
us
that
much
of
what
we
read
in
the
newspapers
is
useless
to
our
culture
a
large
proportion
of
is
occupied
with
speculation
on
what
is
likely
to
happen
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
therefore
by
waiting
until
the
time
is
past
we
know
the
event
without
having
wasted
time
in
speculations
which
could
not
effect
it
another
rather
considerable
fraction
of
newspaper
matter
consists
of
small
events
which
have
interest
for
the
day
owing
to
their
novelty
but
which
will
not
have
the
slightest
permanent
importance
the
whole
press
of
a
country
like
england
or
america
may
be
actively
engaged
during
the
space
of
a
week
or
a
fortnight
in
discussing
some
incident
which
everybody
will
have
forgotten
in
six
months
and
besides
these
sensational
incidents
there
are
hundreds
of
less
notorious
ones
often
fictitious
inserted
simply
for
the
temporary
amusement
of
the
reader
the
greatest
evil
of
newspapers
in
their
effect
on
the
intellectual
life
is
the
enormous
importance
which
they
are
obliged
to
attach
to
mere
novelty
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
it
is
of
no
consequence
whether
a
thought
occurred
centuries
ago
to
aristotle
or
yesterday
evening
to
charles
darwin
and
it
is
one
of
the
distinctive
marks
of
the
truly
intellectual
to
be
able
to
take
a
hearty
interest
in
all
truth
independently
of
the
date
of
its
discovery
the
emphasis
given
by
newspapers
to
novelty
exhibits
things
in
wrong
relations
as
the
lantern
shows
you
what
is
nearest
at
the
cost
of
making
the
general
landscape
appear
darker
by
the
contrast
besides
this
exhibition
of
things
in
wrong
relations
there
is
a
positive
distortion
arising
from
the
unscrupulousness
of
party
a
distortion
which
extends
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
empire
an
essay
might
be
written
on
the
distortion
of
english
affairs
in
the
french
press
or
of
french
affairs
in
the
english
press
by
writers
who
are
as
strongly
partisan
in
another
country
as
in
their
own
it
is
such
a
grand
thing
wrote
an
english
paris
correspondent
in
for
adolphus
thiers
son
of
a
poor
laborer
of
aix
and
in
early
life
a
simple
journalist
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
government
of
france
this
is
a
fair
specimen
of
the
kind
of
false
presentation
which
is
so
common
in
party
journalism
the
newspaper
from
which
i
have
quoted
it
was
strongly
opposed
to
thiers
being
in
fact
one
of
the
principal
organs
of
the
english
bonapartists
it
is
not
true
that
thiers
was
the
son
of
a
poor
laborer
of
aix
his
father
was
a
workman
of
marseilles
his
mother
belonging
to
a
family
in
which
neither
wealth
nor
culture
had
been
rare
and
his
mother
relatives
had
him
educated
at
the
lycée
the
art
of
the
journalist
in
bringing
together
the
two
extremes
of
a
career
remarkable
for
its
steady
ascent
had
for
its
object
to
produce
the
idea
of
incongruity
of
sudden
and
unsuitable
elevation
not
only
thiers
however
but
every
human
being
starts
from
a
very
small
beginning
since
every
man
begins
life
as
a
baby
it
is
a
great
rise
for
one
baby
to
the
presidency
of
the
french
republic
it
was
also
a
great
rise
for
other
babies
who
have
attained
the
premiership
of
england
the
question
is
not
what
thiers
may
have
been
seventy
years
ago
but
what
he
was
immediately
before
his
acceptance
of
the
highest
office
of
the
state
he
was
the
most
trusted
and
the
most
experienced
citizen
so
that
the
last
step
in
his
career
was
as
natural
as
the
elevation
of
reynolds
to
the
presidency
of
the
academy
it
is
difficult
for
any
one
who
cares
for
justice
to
read
party
journals
without
frequent
irritation
and
it
does
not
signify
which
side
the
newspaper
takes
men
are
so
unfair
in
controversy
that
we
best
preserve
the
serenity
of
the
intellect
by
studiously
avoiding
all
literature
that
has
a
controversial
tone
by
your
new
rule
of
abstinence
from
newspapers
you
will
no
doubt
gain
almost
as
much
in
serenity
as
in
time
to
the
ordinary
newspaper
reader
there
is
little
loss
of
serenity
because
he
reads
only
the
newspaper
that
he
agrees
with
and
however
unfair
it
is
he
is
pleased
by
its
unfairness
but
the
highest
and
best
culture
makes
us
disapprove
of
unfairness
on
our
own
side
of
the
question
also
we
are
pained
by
it
we
feel
humiliated
by
it
we
lament
its
persistence
and
its
perversity
i
have
said
nearly
all
that
has
to
be
said
in
favor
of
your
rule
of
abstinence
i
have
granted
that
the
newspapers
cost
us
much
time
which
if
employed
for
great
intellectual
purposes
would
carry
us
very
far
that
they
give
disproportionate
views
of
things
by
the
emphasis
they
give
to
novelty
and
false
views
by
the
unfairness
which
belongs
to
party
i
might
have
added
that
newspaper
writers
give
such
a
preponderance
to
politics
not
political
philosophy
but
to
the
everyday
work
of
politicians
that
intellectual
culture
is
thrown
into
the
background
and
the
election
of
a
single
member
of
parliament
is
made
to
seem
of
greater
national
importance
than
the
birth
of
a
powerful
idea
and
yet
notwithstanding
all
these
considerations
which
are
serious
indeed
for
the
intellectual
i
believe
that
your
resolution
is
unwise
and
that
you
will
find
it
to
be
untenable
one
momentous
reason
more
than
counterbalances
all
these
considerations
put
together
newspapers
are
to
the
whole
civilized
world
what
the
daily
is
to
the
members
of
a
household
they
keep
up
our
daily
interest
in
each
other
they
save
us
from
the
evils
of
isolation
to
live
as
a
member
of
the
great
white
race
of
men
the
race
that
has
filled
europe
and
america
and
colonized
or
conquered
whatever
other
territories
it
has
been
pleased
to
occupy
to
share
from
day
to
day
its
cares
its
thoughts
its
aspirations
it
is
necessary
that
every
man
should
read
his
daily
newspaper
why
are
the
french
peasants
so
bewildered
and
at
sea
so
out
of
place
in
the
modern
world
it
is
because
they
never
read
a
newspaper
and
why
are
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
though
scattered
over
a
territory
fourteen
times
the
area
of
france
so
much
more
capable
of
concerted
political
action
so
much
more
and
modern
so
much
more
interested
in
new
discoveries
of
all
kinds
and
capable
of
selecting
and
utilizing
the
best
of
them
it
is
because
the
newspaper
penetrates
everywhere
and
even
the
lonely
dweller
on
the
prairie
or
in
the
forest
is
not
intellectually
isolated
from
the
great
currents
of
public
life
which
flow
through
the
telegraph
and
the
press
the
experiment
of
doing
without
newspapers
has
been
tried
by
a
whole
class
the
french
peasantry
with
the
consequences
that
we
know
and
it
has
also
from
time
to
time
been
tried
by
single
individuals
belonging
to
more
enlightened
sections
of
society
let
us
take
one
instance
and
let
us
note
what
appear
to
have
been
the
effects
of
this
abstinence
auguste
comte
abstained
from
newspapers
as
a
teetotaller
abstains
from
spirituous
liquors
now
auguste
comte
possessed
a
gift
of
nature
which
though
common
in
minor
degrees
is
in
the
degree
in
which
he
possessed
it
rarer
than
enormous
diamonds
that
gift
was
the
power
of
dealing
with
abstract
intellectual
conceptions
and
living
amidst
them
always
as
the
practical
mind
lives
in
and
deals
with
material
things
and
it
happened
in
comte
case
as
it
usually
does
happen
in
cases
of
very
peculiar
endowment
that
the
gift
was
accompanied
by
the
instincts
necessary
to
its
perfect
development
and
to
its
preservation
comte
instinctively
avoided
the
conversation
of
ordinary
people
because
he
felt
it
to
be
injurious
to
the
perfect
exercise
of
his
faculty
and
for
the
same
reason
he
would
not
read
newspapers
in
imposing
upon
himself
these
privations
he
acted
like
a
very
eminent
living
etcher
who
having
the
gift
of
an
extraordinary
delicacy
of
hand
preserves
it
by
abstinence
from
everything
that
may
effect
the
steadiness
of
the
nerves
there
is
a
certain
difference
however
between
the
two
cases
which
i
am
anxious
to
accentuate
the
etcher
runs
no
risk
of
any
kind
by
his
rule
of
abstinence
he
refrains
from
several
common
indulgences
but
he
denies
himself
nothing
that
is
necessary
to
health
i
may
even
go
farther
and
say
that
the
rules
which
he
observes
for
the
sake
of
perfection
in
his
art
might
be
observed
with
advantage
by
many
who
are
not
artists
for
the
sake
of
their
own
tranquillity
without
the
loss
of
anything
but
pleasure
the
rules
which
comte
made
for
himself
involved
on
the
other
hand
a
great
peril
in
detaching
himself
so
completely
from
the
interests
and
ways
of
thinking
of
ordinary
men
he
elaborated
indeed
the
conceptions
of
the
positive
philosophy
but
arrived
afterwards
at
a
peculiar
kind
of
intellectual
decadence
from
which
it
is
possible
probable
even
that
the
rough
common
sense
of
the
newspapers
might
have
preserved
him
they
would
have
saved
him
i
seriously
believe
from
that
mysticism
which
led
to
the
invention
of
a
religion
far
surpassing
in
unreasonableness
the
least
rational
of
the
creeds
of
tradition
it
is
scarcely
imaginable
except
on
the
supposition
of
actual
insanity
that
any
regular
reader
of
the
the
the
and
the
should
believe
the
human
race
to
be
capable
of
receiving
as
the
religion
of
its
maturity
the
comtist
trinity
and
the
comtist
virgin
mother
a
trinity
consisting
of
the
great
being
or
humanity
the
great
fetish
or
the
earth
and
the
great
midst
or
space
a
hope
for
the
human
race
how
unphysiological
that
women
might
ultimately
arrive
at
maternity
independently
of
virile
help
these
are
conceptions
so
remote
not
only
from
the
habits
of
modern
thought
but
what
is
more
important
from
its
tendencies
that
they
could
not
occur
to
a
mind
in
regular
communication
with
its
contemporaries
if
you
should
transfer
the
amount
of
your
reading
day
by
day
from
the
newspaper
to
the
standard
authors
to
this
suggestion
of
emerson
it
may
be
answered
that
the
loss
would
be
greater
than
the
gain
the
writers
of
queen
anne
time
could
educate
an
englishman
of
queen
time
but
they
can
only
partially
educate
an
englishman
of
queen
victoria
time
the
mind
is
like
a
merchant
ledger
it
requires
to
be
continually
posted
up
to
the
latest
date
even
the
last
telegram
may
have
upset
some
venerable
theory
that
has
been
received
as
infallible
for
ages
in
times
when
great
historical
events
are
passing
before
our
eyes
the
journalist
is
to
future
historians
what
the
african
traveller
is
to
the
his
work
is
neither
complete
nor
orderly
but
it
is
the
fresh
record
of
an
and
enables
us
to
become
ourselves
spectators
of
the
mighty
drama
of
the
world
never
was
this
service
so
well
rendered
as
it
is
now
by
correspondents
who
achieve
heroic
feats
of
bodily
and
mental
prowess
exposing
themselves
to
the
greatest
dangers
and
writing
much
and
well
in
circumstances
the
most
unfavorable
to
literary
composition
how
vividly
the
english
war
correspondents
brought
before
us
the
reality
of
the
great
conflict
between
germany
and
france
what
a
romantic
achievement
worthy
to
be
sung
in
heroic
verse
was
the
finding
of
livingstone
by
stanley
not
less
interesting
have
been
the
admirable
series
of
letters
by
erdan
in
the
in
which
with
the
firmness
of
a
he
has
painted
from
the
life
week
after
week
year
after
year
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
papacy
i
can
not
think
that
any
page
of
roman
history
is
better
worth
reading
than
his
letters
more
interesting
instructive
lively
or
authentic
yet
with
your
contempt
for
newspapers
you
would
lose
all
this
profitable
entertainment
and
seek
instead
of
it
the
accounts
of
former
epochs
not
half
so
interesting
as
this
fall
of
the
temporal
power
accounts
written
in
most
cases
by
men
in
libraries
who
had
not
seen
the
sovereigns
they
wrote
about
nor
talked
with
the
people
whose
condition
they
attempted
to
describe
you
have
a
respect
for
these
accounts
because
they
are
printed
in
books
and
bound
in
leather
and
entitled
history
whilst
you

like

he
is

letter

of

of

of
a

feeling

necessary

invasion
of
the
present

certain
equilibrium
the
opposite
of
a
pedant
the
best
classics
not
pedants
but
artists
reading
the
other
day
a
letter
by
miss
mitford
i
was
reminded
of
you
as
the
eye
is
reminded
of
green
when
it
sees
scarlet
you
whose
interest
in
literature
has
ever
kept
pace
with
the
time
to
whom
no
new
thing
is
unwelcome
if
only
it
is
good
are
safe
from
her
accusations
but
how
many
authors
have
deserved
them
miss
mitford
is
speaking
of
a
certain
writer
who
is
at
the
same
time
a
clergyman
and
whom
it
is
not
difficult
to
recognize
i
never
she
says
saw
him
interested
in
the
slightest
degree
by
the
work
of
any
other
author
except
indeed
one
of
his
own
followers
or
of
his
own
clique
and
then
only
as
admiring
or
helping
him
he
has
great
kindness
and
great
sympathy
with
working
people
or
with
a
dying
friend
but
i
profess
to
you
i
am
amazed
at
the
utter
selfishness
of
authors
i
do
not
know
one
single
poet
who
cares
for
any
man
poetry
but
his
own
in
general
they
read
no
books
except
such
as
may
be
necessary
to
their
own
writings
that
is
to
the
work
they
happen
to
be
about
and
even
then
i
suspect
that
they
only
read
the
bits
that
they
may
immediately
want
you
know
the
absolute
ignorance
in
which
wordsworth
lived
of
all
modern
works
and
if
out
of
compliment
to
a
visitor
he
thought
it
needful
to
seem
to
read
or
listen
to
two
or
three
stanzas
he
gave
unhesitating
praise
to
the
writer
himself
but
took
especial
care
not
to
repeat
the
praise
where
it
might
have
done
him
good
utterly
fair
and
false
there
are
touches
of
this
spirit
of
indifference
to
contemporary
literature
in
several
writers
and
scholars
whom
we
know
there
are
distinct
traces
of
it
even
in
published
writings
though
it
is
much
more
evident
in
private
life
and
habit
emerson
seriously
suggests
that
the
human
mind
would
perhaps
be
a
gainer
if
all
the
secondary
writers
were
lost
say
in
england
all
but
shakespeare
milton
and
bacon
through
the
profounder
study
so
drawn
to
those
wonderful
minds
in
the
same
spirit
we
have
emerson
laconic
rule
never
read
any
but
famed
books
which
suggests
the
remark
that
if
men
had
obeyed
this
rule
from
the
beginning
no
book
could
ever
have
acquired
reputation
and
nobody
would
ever
have
read
anything
the
idea
of
limiting
english
literature
to
a
holy
trinity
of
shakespeare
milton
and
bacon
and
voluntarily
losing
all
other
authors
seems
to
me
the
most
intense
expression
of
the
spirit
of
aristocracy
in
reading
it
is
as
if
a
man
were
to
decide
in
his
own
mind
that
society
would
be
the
better
if
all
persons
except
the
three
emperors
were
excluded
from
it
there
is
a
want
of
reliance
upon
own
judgment
and
an
excess
of
faith
in
the
estimates
of
others
when
we
resolve
to
read
only
those
books
which
come
to
us
in
the
splendor
of
a
recognized
intellectual
royalty
we
read
either
to
gain
information
to
have
good
thinking
suggested
to
us
or
to
have
our
imagination
stimulated
in
the
way
of
knowledge
the
best
authors
are
always
the
most
recent
so
that
bacon
could
not
suffice
in
the
way
of
thinking
our
methods
have
gained
in
precision
since
milton
time
and
we
are
helped
by
a
larger
experience
than
his
the
one
thing
which
shakespeare
and
milton
can
do
for
us
quite
perfectly
still
is
to
fill
our
imagination
richly
and
give
it
a
fine
stimulus
but
modern
writers
can
render
us
the
same
service
is
there
not
a
little
jealousy
of
contemporaries
in
the
persistence
with
which
some
authors
avoid
them
and
even
engage
others
to
avoid
them
may
not
there
be
a
shade
of
another
feeling
than
jealousy
a
feeling
more
subtle
in
operation
the
undefined
apprehension
that
we
may
find
even
amongst
our
more
obscure
contemporaries
merit
equal
to
our
own
so
long
as
we
restrict
our
reading
to
old
books
of
great
fame
we
are
safe
from
this
apprehension
for
if
we
find
admirable
qualities
we
know
beforehand
that
the
world
has
handsomely
acknowledged
them
and
we
indulge
in
the
hope
that
our
own
admirable
qualities
will
be
recognized
by
posterity
with
equal
liberality
but
it
creates
an
unpleasant
feeling
of
uneasiness
to
see
quantities
of
obscure
contemporary
work
done
in
a
plain
way
to
earn
a
living
by
men
of
third
or
reputation
or
of
no
reputation
at
all
which
in
many
respects
would
fairly
sustain
a
comparison
with
our
own
it
is
clear
that
an
author
ought
to
be
the
last
person
to
advise
the
public
not
to
read
contemporary
literature
since
he
is
himself
a
maker
of
contemporary
literature
and
there
is
a
direct
contradiction
between
the
invitation
to
read
his
book
which
he
circulates
by
the
act
of
publishing
and
the
advice
which
the
book
contains
emerson
is
more
safe
from
this
obvious
rejoinder
when
he
suggests
to
us
to
transfer
our
reading
day
by
day
from
the
newspaper
to
the
standard
authors
but
are
these
suggestions
anything
more
than
the
reaction
of
an
intellectual
man
against
the
too
prevalent
customs
of
the
world
the
reading
practised
by
most
people
by
all
who
do
not
set
before
themselves
intellectual
culture
as
one
of
the
definite
aims
of
life
is
remarkable
for
the
regularity
with
which
it
neglects
all
the
great
authors
of
the
past
the
books
provided
by
the
circulating
library
the
reviews
and
magazines
the
daily
newspapers
are
read
whilst
they
are
novelties
but
the
standard
authors
are
left
on
their
shelves
unopened
we
require
a
firm
resolution
to
resist
this
invasion
of
what
is
new
because
it
flows
like
an
unceasing
river
and
unless
we
protect
our
time
against
it
by
some
solid
embankment
of
unshakable
rule
and
resolution
every
nook
and
cranny
of
it
will
be
filled
and
flooded
an
englishman
whose
life
was
devoted
to
culture
but
who
lived
in
an
place
on
the
continent
told
me
that
he
considered
it
a
decided
advantage
to
his
mind
to
live
quite
outside
of
the
english
library
system
because
if
he
wanted
to
read
a
new
book
he
had
to
buy
it
and
pay
heavily
for
carriage
besides
which
made
him
very
careful
in
his
choice
for
the
same
reason
he
rejoiced
that
the
nearest
english
was
two
hundred
miles
from
his
residence
but
on
the
other
hand
what
would
be
the
condition
of
a
man
mind
who
never
read
anything
but
the
classic
authors
he
would
live
in
an
intellectual
monastery
and
would
not
even
understand
the
classic
authors
themselves
for
we
understand
the
past
only
by
referring
it
to
what
we
know
in
the
present
it
is
best
to
preserve
our
minds
in
a
state
of
equilibrium
and
not
to
allow
our
repugnance
to
what
we
see
as
an
evil
to
drive
us
into
an
evil
of
an
opposite
kind
we
are
too
often
like
those
little
with
a
bit
of
steel
in
their
mouths
which
children
attract
with
a
magnet
if
you
present
the
positive
pole
of
the
magnet
the
fish
rushes
at
it
at
once
but
if
you
offer
the
negative
end
it
retreats
continually
everything
relatively
to
our
character
has
this
positive
or
negative
end
and
we
either
rush
to
things
or
rush
away
from
them
some
persons
are
actually
driven
away
from
the
most
entertaining
writers
because
they
happen
to
be
what
are
called
classics
because
pedants
boast
of
having
read
them
i
know
a
man
who
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
a
pedant
who
has
a
horror
of
the
charlatanism
which
claims
social
and
intellectual
position
as
the
reward
for
having
laboriously
waded
through
those
authors
who
are
conventionally
termed
classical
and
this
opposition
to
pedantry
has
given
him
an
aversion
to
the
classics
themselves
which
he
never
opens
the
shallow
pretence
to
admiration
of
famous
writers
which
is
current
in
the
world
is
so
distasteful
to
the
love
of
honesty
and
reality
which
is
the
basis
of
his
character
that
by
an
unhappy
association
of
ideas
he
has
acquired
a
repugnance
to
the
writers
themselves
but
such
men
as
horace
terence
shakespeare
molière
though
they
have
had
the
misfortune
to
be
praised
and
commentated
upon
by
pedants

in
their
lives
the
precise
opposite
of
pedants
they
were
whose
study
was
human
nature
and
who
lived
without
pretension
in
the
common
world
of
men
the
pedants
have
a
habit
of
considering
these
genial
old
artists
as
in
some
mysterious
way
their
own
private
property
for
do
not
the
pedants
live
by
expounding
them
and
some
of
us
are
frightened
away
from
the
fairest
realms

the
fences

reminded
me
of
julian
fane
lytton
tells
us
that
after
a
long
day
of
professional
business
followed
by
a
late
evening
of
social
amusement
he
would
return
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
to
his
books
and
sit
unwearied
till
sunrise
in
the
study
of
them
nor
did
he
then
seem
to
suffer
from
this
habit
of
late
hours
his
nightly
vigils
occasioned
no
appearance

fatigue

next

later

sense
of
wanting
the
government
of
fixed
rules
there
always
comes
in

a
certain
regularity
by
the
mere
operation
of
habit
people
who
get
up
very
late
hardly
ever
do
so
in
obedience
to
a
rule
many
get
up
early
by
rule
and
many
more
are
told
that
they
ought
to
get
up
early
and
believe
it
and
aspire
to
that
virtue
but
fail
to
carry
it
into
practice
the
are
rebels
and
sinners
in
this
respect
to
a
man
and
so
persistently
have
the
wise
from
solomon
downwards
harped
upon
the
moral
loveliness
of
early
rising
and
the
degradation
which
follows
the
opposite
practice
that
one
can
hardly
get
up
after
eight
without
either
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
guilt
or
an
extraordinary
callousness
yet
the
though
obeying
no
rule
for
the
abandoned
sinner
recognizes
none
become
regular
in
their
late
rising
from
the
gradual
fixing

of
habit

julian
fane
though
he
regretted
his
desultory
ways
and
dwelt
with
great
earnestness
on
the
importance
of
regular
habits
of
work
was
perhaps
less
irregular
than
he
himself
believed
we
are
sure
to
acquire
habits
what
is
important
is
not
so
much
that
the
habits
should
be
regular
as
that
their
regularity
should
be
of
the
kind
most
favorable
in
the
long
run
to
the
accomplishment
of
our
designs
and
this
never
comes
by
chance
it
is
the
result
of
an
effort
of
the
will
in
obedience
to
governing
wisdom
the
first
question
which
every
one
who
has
the
choice
of
his
hours
must
settle
for
himself
is
at
what
time
of
day
he
will
make
his
principal
effort
for
the
day
of
every
intellectual
workman
ought
to
be
marked
by
a
kind
of
artistic
composition
there
ought
to
be
some
one
labor
distinctly
recognized
as
dominant
with
others
in
subordination
and
subordination
of
various
degrees
now
for
the
hours
at
which
the
principal
effort
ought
to
be
made
it
is
not
possible
to
fix
them
by
the
clock
so
as
to
be
suitable
for
everybody
but
a
broad
rule
may
be
arrived
at
which
is
applicable
to
all
imaginable
cases
the
rule
is
this
to
do
the
chief
work
in
the
best
hours
to
give
it
the
pick
of
your
day
and
by
day
i
do
not
mean
only
the
solar
day
but
the
whole
of
the
hours
there
is
an
important
physiological
reason
for
giving
the
best
hours
to
the
most
important
work
the
better
the
condition
of
the
brain
and
the
body
and
the
more
favorable
the
surrounding
circumstances
the
smaller
will
be
the
cost
to
the
organization
of
the
labor
that
has
to
be
done
it
is
always
the
safest
way
to
do
the
heaviest
or
most
important
work
at
the
time
and
under
the
conditions
which
make
it
the
least
costly
physicians
are
unanimous
in
their
preference
of
early
to
late
work
and
no
doubt
if
the
question
were
not
complicated
by
other
considerations
we
could
not
do
better
than
to
follow
their
advice
in
its
simplicity
goethe
wrote
in
the
morning
with
his
faculties
refreshed
by
sleep
and
not
yet
excited
by
any
stimulant
i
could
mention
several
living
authors
of
eminence
who
pursue
the
same
plan
and
find
it
favorable
alike
to
health
and
to
production
the
rule
which
they
follow
is
never
to
write
after
lunch
leaving
the
rest
of
their
time
free
for
study
and
society
both
of
which
are
absolutely
necessary
to
authors
according
to
this
system
it
is
presumed
that
the
hours
between
breakfast
and
lunch
are
the
best
hours
in
many
cases
they
are
so
a
person
in
fair
health
after
taking
a
light
early
breakfast
without
any
heavier
stimulant
than
tea
or
coffee
finds
himself
in
a
state
of
freshness
highly
favorable
to
sound
and
agreeable
thinking
his
brain
will
be
in
still
finer
order
if
the
breakfast
has
been
preceded
by
a
cold
bath
with
friction
and
a
little
exercise
the
feeling
of
freshness
cleanliness
and
moderate
exhilaration
will
last
for
several
hours
and
during
those
hours
the
intellectual
work
will
probably
be
both
lively
and
reasonable
it
is
difficult
for
a
man
who
feels
cheerful
and
refreshed
and
whose
task
seems
easy
and
light
to
write
anything
morbid
or
perverse
but
for
the
morning
to
be
so
good
as
i
have
just
described
it
the
workman
must
be
quite
favorably
situated
he
ought
to
live
in
a
very
tranquil
neighborhood
and
to
be
as
free
as
possible
from
anxiety
as
to
what
the
postman
may
have
in
reserve
for
him
if
his
looks
out
on
a
noisy
street
and
if
the
day
is
sure
as
it
wears
on
to
bring
anxious
business
of
its
own
then
the
increasing
noise
and
the
apprehension
even
though
it
be
almost
entirely
unconscious
of
impending
business
will
be
quite
sufficient
to
interfere
with
the
work
of
any
man
who
is
the
least
in
the
world
nervous
and
almost
all
intellectual
laborers
nervous
more
or
less
men
who
have
the
inestimable
advantage
of
absolute
tranquillity
at
all
times
do
well
to
work
in
the
morning
but
those
who
can
only
get
tranquillity
at
times
independent
of
their
own
choice
have
a
strong
reason
for
working
at
those
times
whether
they
happen
to
be
in
the
morning
or
not
in
an
excellent
article
on
work
evidently
written
by
an
experienced
intellectual
workman
which
appeared
in
one
of
the
early
numbers
of
the
and
was
remarkable
alike
for
practical
wisdom
and
the
entire
absence
of
traditional
dogmatism
the
writer
speaks
frankly
in
favor
of
if
you
can
work
at
all
at
night
one
hour
at
that
time
is
worth
any
two
in
the
morning
the
house
is
hushed
the
brain
is
clear
the
distracting
influences
of
the
day
are
at
an
end
you
have
not
to
disturb
yourself
with
thoughts
of
what
you
are
about
to
do
or
what
you
are
about
to
suffer
you
know
that
there
is
a
gulf
between
you
and
the
affairs
of
the
outside
world
almost
like
the
chasm
of
death
and
that
you
need
not
take
thought
of
the
morrow
until
the
morrow
has
come
there
are
few
really
great
thoughts
such
as
the
world
will
not
willingly
let
die
that
have
not
been
conceived
under
the
quiet
stars
the
medical
objection
to
in
the
case
of
literary
men
would
probably
be
that
the
night
is
favorable
to
literary
production
the
author
of
the
essay
just
quoted
says
that
at
night
you
only
drift
into
deeper
silence
quicker
if
the
right
mood
is
upon
you
write
if
not
your
pillow
awaits
you
exactly
so
that
is
to
say
the
brain
owing
to
the
complete
external
tranquillity
can
so
concentrate
its
efforts
on
the
subject
in
hand
as
to
work
itself
up
into
a
luminous
condition
which
is
fed
by
the
most
rapid
destruction
of
the
nervous
substance
that
ever
takes
place
within
the
walls
of
a
human
skull
if
the
right
mood
is
upon
you
write
in
other
words
if
you
have
once
well
lighted
your
it
will
go
on
burning
so
long
as
any
spirit
is
left
in
it
for
the
air
is
so
tranquil
that
nothing
comes
to
blow
it
out
you
drift
into
deeper
silence
and
quicker
inspiration
it
is
just
this
quicker
inspiration
that
the
physician
dreads
against
this
objection
may
be
placed
the
equally
serious
objection
to
that
every
interruption
when
you
are
particularly
anxious
not
to
be
interrupted
causes
a
definite
loss
and
injury
to
the
nervous
system
the
choice
must
therefore
be
made
between
two
dangers
and
if
they
are
equally
balanced
there
can
be
no
hesitation
because
all
the
interests
of
an
author
are
on
the
side
of
the
most
tranquil
time
literary
work
is
always
sure
to
be
much
better
done
when
there
is
no
fear
of
disturbance
than
under
the
apprehension
of
it
and
precisely
the
same
amount
of
cerebral
effort
will
produce
when
the
work
is
uninterrupted
not
only
better
writing
but
a
much
greater
quantity
of
writing
the
knowledge
that
he
is
working
well
and
productively
is
an
element
of
health
to
every
workman
because
it
encourages
cheerful
habits
of
mind
in
the
division
of
time
it
is
an
excellent
rule
for
adults
to
keep
it
as
much
as
possible
large
not
giving
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
one
occupation
and
a
quarter
to
another
but
giving
three
four
or
five
hours
to
one
thing
at
a
time
in
the
case
of
children
an
opposite
practice
should
be
followed
they
are
able
to
change
their
attention
from
one
subject
to
another
much
more
easily
than
we
can
whilst
at
the
same
time
they
can
not
fix
their
minds
for
very
long
without
cerebral
fatigue
leading
to
temporary
incapacity
the
custom
prevalent
in
schools
of
making
the
boys
learn
several
different
things
in
the
course
of
the
day
is
therefore
founded
upon
the
necessities
of
the
though
most
grown
men
would
find
that
changes
so
frequent
would
for
them
have
all
the
inconveniences
of
interruption
to
boys
they
come
as
relief
to
men
as
interruption
the
reason
is
that
the
physical
condition
of
the
brain
is
different
in
the
two
cases
but
in
our
loose
way
of
talking
about
these
things
we
may
say
that
the
boy
ideas
are
superficial
like
the
plates
and
dishes
on
the
surface
of
a
which
may
be
rapidly
changed
without
inconvenience
whereas
the
man
ideas
having
all
struck
root
down
to
the
very
depths
of
his
nature
are
more
like
the
plants
in
a
garden
which
can
not
be
removed
without
a
temporary
loss
both
of
vigor
and
of
beauty
and
the
loss
can
not
be
instantaneously
repaired
for
a
man
to
do
his
work
thoroughly
well
it
is
necessary
that
he
should
dwell
in
it
long
enough
at
a
time
to
get
all
the
powers
of
his
mind
fully
under
command
with
reference
to
the
particular
work
in
hand
and
he
can
not
do
this
without
tuning
his
whole
mind
to
the
given
diapason
as
a
tuner
tunes
a
piano
some
men
can
tune
their
minds
more
rapidly
as
violins
are
tuned
and
this
faculty
may
to
a
certain
extent
be
acquired
by
efforts
of
the
will
very
frequently
repeated
cuvier
had
this
faculty
in
the
most
eminent
degree
one
of
his
biographers
says
his
extreme
facility
for
study
and
of
directing
all
the
powers
of
his
mind
to
diverse
occupations
of
study
from
one
quarter
of
an
hour
to
another
was
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
qualities
of
his
mind
the
duke
of
wellington
also
cultivated
the
habit
inestimably
valuable
to
a
public
man
of
directing
the
whole
of
his
attention
to
the
subject
under
consideration
however
frequently
that
subject
might
happen
to
be
changed
but
although
men
of
exceptional
power
and
very
exceptional
flexibility
may
do
this
with
apparent
impunity
that
still
depends
very
much
on
the
nature
of
the
occupation
there
are
some
occupations
which
are
not
incompatible
with
a
fragmentary
division
of
time
because
these
occupations
are
themselves
fragmentary
for
example
you
may
study
languages
in
during
very
small
spaces
of
time
because
the
complete
phrase
is
in
itself
a
very
small
thing
but
you
could
not
so
easily
break
and
resume
the
thread
of
an
elaborate
argument
i
suspect
that
though
cuvier
appeared
to
his
contemporaries
a
man
remarkably
able
to
leave
off
and
resume
his
work
at
will
he
must
have
taken
care
to
do
work
that
would
bear
interruption
at
those
times
when
he
knew
himself
to
be
most
liable
to
it
and
although
when
a
man
time
is
unavoidably
broken
up
into
fragments
no
talent
of
a
merely
auxiliary
kind
can
be
more
precious
than
that
of
turning
each
of
those
fragments
to
advantage
it
is
still
true
that
he
whose
time
is
at
his
own
disposal
will
do
his
work
most
calmly
most
deliberately
and
therefore
on
the
whole
most
thoroughly
and
perfectly
when
he
keeps
it
in
fine
masses
the
mere
knowledge
that
you
have
three
or
four
clear
hours
before
you
is
in
itself
a
great
help
to
the
spirit
of
thoroughness
both
in
study
and
in
production
it
is
agreeable
too
when
the
sitting
has
come
to
an
end
to
perceive
that
a
definite
advance
is
the
result
of
it
and
advance
in
anything
is
scarcely
perceptible
in
less
than
three
or
four
hours
there
are
several
pursuits
which
be
followed
in
fragments
of
time
on
account
of
the
necessary
preparations
it
is
useless
to
begin
unless
you
have
full
time
to
set
your
palette
properly
to
get
your
canvas
into
a
proper
state
for
working
upon
to
pose
the
model
as
you
wish
and
settle
down
to
work
with
everything
as
it
ought
to
be
in
from
nature
you
require
the
time
to
go
to
the
selected
place
and
after
your
arrival
to
arrange
your
materials
and
shelter
yourself
from
the
sun
in
scientific
pursuits
the
preparations
are
usually
at
least
equally
elaborate
and
often
much
more
so
to
prepare
for
an
experiment
or
for
a
dissection
takes
time
which
we
feel
to
be
disproportionate
when
it
leaves
too
little
for
the
scientific
work
itself
it
is
for
this
reason
more
frequently
than
for
any
other
that
amateurs
who
begin
in
enthusiasm
so
commonly
after
a
while
abandon
the
objects
of
their
pursuit
there
is
a
kind
of
slavery
to
which
no
really
intellectual
man
would
ever
voluntarily
submit
a
minute
obedience
to
the
clock
very
conscientious
people
often
impose
upon
themselves
this
sort
of
slavery
a
person
who
has
hampered
himself
with
rules
of
this
kind
will
take
up
a
certain
book
for
instance
when
the
clock
strikes
nine
and
begin
at
yesterday
mark
perhaps
in
the
middle
of
a
paragraph
then
he
will
read
with
great
steadiness
till
a
nine
and
exactly
on
the
instant
when
the
gets
opposite
the
dot
he
will
shut
his
book
however
much
the
passage
may
happen
to
interest
him
it
was
in
allusion
to
good
people
of
this
kind
that
sir
walter
scott
said
he
had
never
known
a
man
of
genius
who
could
be
perfectly
regular
in
his
habits
whilst
he
had
known
many
blockheads
who
could
it
is
easy
to
see
that
a
minute
obedience
to
the
clock
is
unintellectual
in
its
very
nature
for
the
intellect
is
not
a
piece
of
mechanism
as
a
clock
is
and
can
not
easily
be
made
to
act
like
one
there
may
be
perfect
correspondence
between
the
locomotives
and
the
clocks
on
a
railway
for
if
the
clocks
are
pieces
of
mechanism
the
locomotives
are
so
likewise
but
the
intellect
always
needs
a
certain
looseness
and
latitude
as
to
time
very
broad
rules
are
the
best
such
as
write
in
the
morning
read
in
the
afternoon
see
friends
in
the
evening
or
else
study
one
day
and
produce
another
alternately
or
even
work
one
week
and
see
the
world
another
week
alternately
there
is
a
fretting
habit
much
recommended
by
men
of
business
and
of
great
use
to
them
of
writing
the
evening
before
the
duties
of
the
day
in
a
book
of
agenda
if
this
is
done
at
all
by
intellectual
men
with
reference
to
their
pursuits
it
ought
to
be
done
in
a
very
broad
loose
way
never
minutely
an
intellectual
worker
ought
never
to
make
it
a
matter
of
conscience
in
intellectual
labor
to
do
a
predetermined
quantity
of
little
things
this
sort
of
conscientiousness
frets
and
worries
and
is
the
enemy
of
all
serenity

exercise

but
it
would
be
with
the
intention

which
constantly

and
the
church
would
have
suited
you
in

respects
very
happily
yet
not
i
think
in
all
respects
the
clerical
profession
has
many
great
felicities
and
advantages
it
educates
and
develops
by
its
mild
but
regular
discipline
much
of
our
higher
nature
it
sets
before
us
an
elevated
ideal
worth
striving
for
at
the
cost
of
every
sacrifice
but
one
of
which
i
intend
to
say
something
farther
on
and
it
offers
just
that
mixture
of
public
and
private
life
which
best
affords
the
alternation
of
activity
and
rest
it
is
an
existence
in
many
respects
most
favorable
to
the
noblest
studies
it
offers
the
happiest
combination
of
duties
that
satisfy
the
conscience
with
leisure
for
the
cultivation
of
the
mind
it
gives
the
easiest
access
to
all
classes
of
society
providing
for
the
parson
himself
a
neutral
and
independent
position
so
safe
that
he
need
only
conduct
himself
properly
to
preserve
it
how
superior
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
is
this
liberal
existence
to
the
narrower
one
of
a
french
de
i
certainly
think
that
if
a
good
has
an
exceptional
genius
for
sanctity
his
chances
of
becoming
a
perfect
saint
are
better
than
those
of
a
comfortable
english
incumbent
who
is
at
the
same
time
a
gentleman
and
man
of
the
world
but
he
is
not
nearly
so
well
situated
for
leading
the
intellectual
life
our
own
clergy
have
a
sort
of
middle
position
between
the
and
the
layman
which
without
at
all
interfering
with
their
spiritual
vocation
makes
them
better
judges
of
the
character
of
laymen
and
more
completely
in
sympathy
with
it
and
yet
although
the
life
of
a
clergyman
is
favorable
to
culture
in
many
ways
it
is
not
wholly
favorable
to
it
there
exists
in
clerical
thinking
generally
just
one
restriction
or
impediment
which
is
the
overwhelming
importance
of
the
professional
point
of
view
of
all
the
professions
the
ecclesiastical
one
is
that
which
most
decidedly
and
most
constantly
affects
the
judgment
of
persons
and
opinions
it
is
peculiarly
difficult
for
a
clergyman
to
attain
disinterestedness
in
his
thinking
to
accept
truth
just
as
it
may
happen
to
present
itself
without
passionately
desiring
that
one
doctrine
may
turn
out
to
be
strong
in
evidence
and
another
unsupported
and
so
we
find
the
clergy
as
a
class
anxious
rather
to
discover
aids
to
faith
than
the
simple
scientific
truth
and
the
more
the
special
priestly
character
develops
itself
the
more
we
find
them
disposed
to
use
their
intellects
for
the
triumph
of
principles
that
are
decided
upon
beforehand
sometimes
this
disposition
leads
them
to
see
the
acts
of
laymen
in
a
colored
light
and
to
speak
of
them
without
strict
accuracy
here
is
an
example
of
what
i
mean
a
jesuit
priest
preached
a
sermon
in
london
very
recently
in
which
he
said
that
in
germany
france
italy
and
england
gigantic
efforts
were
being
made
to
rob
christian
children
of
the
blessing
of
a
christian
education
herod
though
dead
the
preacher
continued
has
left
his
mantle
behind
him
and
i
wish
that
the
soldiers
of
herod
in
those
countries
would
plunge
their
swords
into
the
breasts
of
little
children
while
they
were
innocent
rather
than
have
their
souls
destroyed
by
means
of
an
unchristian
and
uncatholic
education
no
doubt
this
is
very
earnest
and
sincere
but
it
is
not
accurate
and
just
thinking
the
laity
in
the
countries
the
preacher
mentioned
have
certainly
a
strong
tendency
to
exclude
theology
from
state
schools
because
it
is
so
difficult
for
a
modern
state
to
impose
any
kind
of
theological
teaching
without
injustice
to
minorities
but
the
laity
do
not
desire
to
deprive
children
of
whatever
instruction
may
be
given
to
them
by
the
clergy
of
their
respective
communions
may
i
add
that
to
the
mind
of
a
layman
it
seems
a
sanguinary
desire
that
all
little
children
should
have
swords
plunged
into
their
breasts
rather
than
be
taught
in
schools
not
clerically
directed
the
exact
truth
is
that
the
powerful
lay
element
is
certainly
separating
itself
from
the
ecclesiastical
element
all
over
europe
because
it
is
found
by
experience
that
the
two
have
a
great
and
increasing
difficulty
in
working
harmoniously
together
but
the
ecclesiastical
element
is
detached
and
not
destroyed
the
quotation
i
have
just
made
is
in
itself
a
sufficient
illustration
of
that
very
peculiarity
in
the
more
exalted
ecclesiastical
temperament
which
often
makes
it
so
difficult
for
priests
and
governments
in
these
times
to
get
on
comfortably
together
here
is
first
a
very
inaccurate
statement
and
then
an
outburst
of
most
passionate
feeling
whereas
the
intellect
desires
the
strictest
truth
and
the
most
complete
disinterestedness
as
the
temper
of
the
laity
becomes
more
and
more
intellectual
and
that
is
the
direction
of
its
movement
the
sacerdotal
habit
will
become
more
and
more
remote
from
it
the
clerical
life
has
many
strong
attractions
for
the
intellectual
and
just
one
drawback
to
counterbalance
them
it
offers
tranquillity
shelter
from
the
interruptions
and
anxieties
of
the
more
active
professions
and
powerful
means
of
influence
ready
to
hand
but
it
is
compatible
with
intellectual
freedom
and
with
the
satisfaction
of
the
conscience
only
just
so
long
as
the
priest
really
remains
a
believer
in
the
details
of
his
religion
now
although
we
may
reasonably
hope
to
retain
the
chief
elements
of
our
belief
although
what
a
man
believes
at
is
always
what
he
will
most
probably
believe
at
fifty
still
in
an
age
when
free
inquiry
is
the
common
habit
of
cultivated
people
of
our
sex
we
may
well
hesitate
before
taking
upon
ourselves
any
formal
engagement
for
the
future
especially
in
matters
of
detail
the
intellectual
spirit
does
not
regard
its
conclusions
as
being
at
any
time
final
but
always
provisional
we
hold
what
we
believe
to
be
the
truth
until
we
can
replace
it
by
some
more
perfect
truth
but
can
not
tell
how
much
of
beliefs
will
retain
or
reject
it
may
be
observed
however
that
the
regular
performance
of
priestly
functions
is
in
itself
a
great
help
to
permanence
in
belief
by
connecting
it
closely
with
practical
habit
so
that
the
clergy
do
really
and
honestly
often
retain
through
life
their
hold
on
early
beliefs
which
as
laymen
they
might
have
lost
the
profession
of
the
law
provides
ample
opportunities
for
a
critical
intellect
with
a
strong
love
of
accuracy
and
a
robust
capacity
for
hard
work
besides
which
it
is
the
best
of
worldly
educations
some
lawyers
love
their
work
as
passionately
as
artists
do
theirs
others
dislike
it
very
heartily
most
of
them
seem
to
take
it
as
a
simple
business
to
be
done
for
daily
bread
lawyers
whose
heart
is
in
their
work
are
invariably
men
of
superior
ability
which
proves
that
there
is
something
in
it
that
affords
gratification
to
the
intellectual
powers
however
in
speaking
of
lawyers
i
feel
ignorant
and
on
the
outside
because
their
profession
is
one
of
which
the
interior
feelings
can
be
known
to
no
one
who
has
not
practised
one
thing
seems
clear
they
get
the
habit
of
employing
the
whole
strength
and
energy
of
their
minds
for
especial
and
temporary
ends
the
purpose
being
the
service
of
the
client
certainly
not
the
revelation
of
pure
truth
hence
although
they
become
very
acute
and
keen
judges
of
that
side
of
human
nature
which
they
habitually
see
not
the
best
side
they
are
not
more
disinterested
than
clergymen
sometimes
they
take
up
some
study
outside
of
their
profession
and
follow
it
disinterestedly
but
this
is
rare
a
busy
lawyer
is
much
more
likely
than
a
clergyman
to
become
entirely
absorbed
in
his
professional
life
because
it
requires
so
much
more
intellectual
exertion
i
remember
asking
a
very
clever
lawyer
who
lived
in
london
whether
he
ever
visited
an
exhibition
of
pictures
and
he
answered
me
by
the
whether
i
had
read
chitty
on
contracts
collier
on
partnerships
taylor
on
evidence
cruse
digest
or
smith
mercantile
law
this
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
a
good
instance
of
the
way
a
professional
habit
may
narrow
one
views
of
things
for
these
were
written
for
lawyers
alone
whilst
the
picture
exhibitions
were
intended
for
the
public
generally
my
friend
answer
would
have
been
more
to
the
point
if
i
had
inquired
whether
he
had
read
linton
on
colors
and
burnet
on
chiaroscuro
there
is
just
one
situation
in
which
we
all
may
feel
for
a
short
time
as
lawyers
feel
habitually
suppose
that
two
inexperienced
players
sit
down
to
a
game
of
chess
and
that
each
is
backed
by
a
clever
person
who
is
constantly
giving
him
hints
the
two
backers
represent
the
lawyers
and
the
players
represent
their
clients
there
is
not
much
disinterested
thought
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
but
there
is
a
strong
stimulus
to
acuteness
i
think
that
lawyers
are
often
superior
to
philosophers
in
their
sense
of
what
is
relatively
important
in
human
affairs
with
reference
to
limited
spaces
of
time
such
as
half
a
century
they
especially
know
the
enormous
importance
of
custom
which
the
speculative
mind
very
readily
forgets
and
they
have
in
the
highest
degree
that
peculiar
sense
which
fits
men
for
dealing
with
others
in
the
affairs
of
ordinary
life
in
this
respect
they
are
remarkably
superior
to
clergymen
and
superior
also
to
artists
and
men
of
science
the
profession
of
medicine
is
of
all
fairly
lucrative
professions
the
one
best
suited
to
the
development
of
the
intellectual
life
having
to
deal
continually
with
science
being
constantly
engaged
in
following
and
observing
the
operation
of
natural
laws
it
produces
a
sense
of
the
working
of
those
laws
which
prepares
the
mind
for
bold
and
original
speculation
and
a
reliance
upon
their
unfailing
regularity
which
gives
it
great
firmness
and
assurance
a
medical
education
is
the
best
possible
preparation
for
philosophical
pursuits
because
it
gives
them
a
solid
basis
in
the
ascertainable
the
estimation
in
which
these
studies
are
held
is
an
accurate
meter
of
the
intellectual
advancement
of
a
community
when
the
priest
is
reverenced
as
a
being
above
ordinary
humanity
and
the
physician
slightly
esteemed
the
condition
of
society
is
sure
to
be
that
of
comparative
ignorance
and
barbarism
and
it
is
one
of
several
signs
which
indicate
barbarian
feeling
in
our
own
aristocracy
that
it
has
a
contempt
for
the
study
of
medicine
the
progress
of
society
towards
enlightenment
is
marked
by
the
steady
social
rise
of
the
surgeon
and
the
physician
a
rise
which
still
continues
even
in
western
europe
it
is
probable
that
before
very
long
the
medical
profession
will
exercise
a
powerful
influence
upon
general
education
and
take
an
active
share
in
it
there
are
very
strong
reasons
for
the
opinion
that
schoolmasters
educated
in
medicine
would
be
peculiarly
well
qualified
to
train
both
body
and
mind
for
a
vigorous
and
active
manhood
an
immense
advantage
even
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
in
the
pursuit
of
medicine
and
surgery
is
that
they
supply
a
discipline
in
mental
heroism
other
professions
do
this
also
but
not
to
the
same
degree
the
combination
of
an
accurate
training
in
positive
science
with
the
habitual
contempt
of
danger
and
contemplation
of
suffering
and
death
is
the
finest
possible
preparation
for
noble
studies
and
arduous
discoveries
i
ought
to
add
however
that
medical
men
in
the
provinces
when
they
have
not
any
special
enthusiasm
for
their
work
seem
peculiarly
liable
to
the
deadening
influences
of
routine
and
easily
fall
behind
their
age
the
medical
periodicals
provide
the
best
remedy
for
this
the
military
and
naval
professions
are
too
active
and
too
much
bound
to
obedience
in
their
activity
for
the
highest
intellectual
pursuits
but
their
greatest
evil
in
this
respect
is
the
continual
privation
of
solitude
and
the
frequency
of
interruption
a
soldier
life
in
the
higher
ranks
when
there
is
great
responsibility
and
the
necessity
for
personal
decision
undoubtedly
leads
to
the
most
brilliant
employment
of
the
mental
powers
and
develops
a
manliness
of
character
which
is
often
of
the
greatest
use
in
intellectual
work
so
that
a
man
of
science
may
find
his
force
augmented
and
better
under
control
for
having
passed
through
a
military
experience
but
the
life
of
barracks
and
camps
is
destructive
to
continuity
of
thinking
the
incompatibility
becomes
strikingly
manifest
when
we
reflect
how
impossible
it
would
have
been
for
ney
or
massena
to
do
the
work
of
cuvier
or
comte
cuvier
even
declined
to
accompany
the
expedition
to
egypt
notwithstanding
the
prospects
of
advantage
that
it
offered
the
reason
he
gave
for
this
refusal
was
that
he
could
do
more
for
science
in
the
tranquillity
of
the
jardin
des
plantes
he
was
a
strict
economist
of
time
and
dreaded
the
loss
of
it
involved
in
following
an
army
even
though
his
mission
would
have
been
purely
scientific
how
much
more
would
cuvier
have
dreaded
the
interruptions
of
a
really
military
existence
it
is
these
interruptions
and
not
any
want
of
natural
ability
that
are
the
true
explanation
of
the
intellectual
poverty
which
characterizes
the
military
profession
of
all
the
liberal
professions
it
is
the
least
studious
let
me
say
a
word
in
conclusion
about
the
practical
pursuit
of
the
fine
arts
painters
are
often
remarkable
for
pleasant
conversational
power
and
a
degree
of
intelligence
strikingly
superior
to
their
literary
culture
this
is
because
the
processes
of
their
art
can
be
followed
at
least
under
certain
circumstances
by
the
exercise
of
hand
and
eye
directed
merely
by
artistic
taste
and
experience
whilst
the
intellect
is
left
free
either
for
reflection
or
conversation
rubens
liked
to
be
read
to
when
he
painted
many
artists
like
to
hear
people
talk
and
to
take
a
share
occasionally
in
the
conversation
the
truth
is
that
artists
even
when
they
work
very
assiduously
do
in
fact
enjoy
great
spaces
of
intellectual
leisure
and
often
profit
by
them
painting
itself
is
also
a
fine
discipline
for
some
of
the
best
faculties
of
the
mind
though
it
is
well
known
that
the
most
gifted
artists
think
least
about
their
art
still
there
is
a
large
class
of
painters
including
many
eminent
ones
who
in
the
execution
of
their
works
who
reason
them
out
philosophically
step
by
step
and
exercise
a
continual
criticism
upon
their
manual
labor
as
it
goes
forward
i
find
as
i
know
art
and
artists
better
that
this
class
is
more
numerous
than
is
commonly
suspected
and
that
the
charming
effects
which
we
believe
to
be
the
result
of
pure
inspiration
have
often
been
elaborately
reasoned
out
like
a
problem
in
mathematics
we
are
very
apt
to
forget
that
art
includes
a
great
science
the
science
of
natural
appearances
and
that
the
technical
work
of
painters
and
engravers
can
not
go
forward
safely
without
the
profoundest
knowledge
of
certain
delicate
materials
this
being
also
a
science
and
a
difficult
one
the
common
tendency
is
to
underrate
from
ignorance
what
is
intellectual
in
the
practice
of
the
fine
arts
and
yet
the
artists
of
past
times
have
left
evidence
enough
that
they
thought
about
art
and
thought
deeply
artists
are
often
illiterate
but
it
is
possible
to
be
at
the
same
time
illiterate
and
intellectual
as
we
see
frequent
examples
of
in
people
who
have
scarcely
a
single
idea
of
their
own
letter
ii
to
a
young
gentleman
who
had
literary
and
artistic
tastes
but
no
profession
the
world
only
recognizes
performance
uselessness
of
vastness
of
the
interval
between
and
handicraft
delusions
of
the
quotation
from
charles
lever
indifference
and
even
contempt
for
skill
moral
contempt
for
skill
the
contempt
which
comes
from
the
pride
of
knowledge
intellectual
value
of
skill
and
of
professional
discipline
it
is
not
a
graceful
thing
for
me
to
say
nor
pleasant
for
you
to
hear
that
what
you
have
done
hitherto
in
art
and
literature
is
neither
of
any
value
in
itself
nor
likely
to
lead
you
to
that
which
is
truly
and
permanently
satisfying
i
believe
you
have
natural
ability
though
it
would
not
be
easy
for
any
critic
to
measure
its
degree
when
it
has
never
been
developed
by
work
most
critics
would
probably
err
on
the
unfavorable
side
for
we
are
easily
blind
to
powers
that
are
little
more
than
latent
to
see
anything
encouraging
in
your
present
performance
it
would
need
the
sympathy
and
intelligence
of
the
american
sculptor
greenough
of
whom
it
was
said
that
his
recognition
was
not
limited
to
achievement
but
extended
to
latent
powers
the
world
however
recognizes
nothing
short
of
performance
because
the
performance
is
what
it
needs
and
promises
are
of
no
use
to
it
in
this
rough
justice
of
the
world
there
is
a
natural
distribution
of
rewards
you
will
be
paid
in
fame
and
money
for
all
excellent
work
and
you
will
be
paid
in
money
though
not
in
fame
for
all
work
that
is
even
simply
good
provided
it
be
of
a
kind
that
the
world
needs
or
fancies
that
it
needs
but
you
will
never
be
paid
at
all
for
neither
in
money
nor
in
fame
nor
by
your
own
inward
approval
for
we
all
of
us
either
know
that
our
is
worthless
or
else
have
serious
misgivings
about
it
that
which
is
less
commonly
realized
by
those
who
have
not
undergone
the
test
of
professional
labor
is
the
vastness
of
the
interval
that
separates
from
handicraft
and
the
difficulty
of
getting
over
it
there
are
few
delusions
charles
lever
said
in
the
bramleighs
more
common
with
people
than
the
belief
that
if
to
it
they
could
earn
their
own
livelihood
in
a
variety
of
ways
almost
every
man
has
some
two
or
three
or
more
accomplishments
which
he
fancies
would
be
quite
adequate
to
his
support
and
remembering
with
what
success
the
exercise
of
these
gifts
has
ever
been
hailed
in
the
society
of
his
friends
he
has
a
sort
of
generous
dislike
to
be
obliged
to
eclipse
some
poor
drudge
of
a
professional
who
of
course
will
be
consigned
to
utter
oblivion
after
his
own
performance
augustus
bramleigh
was
certainly
not
a
conceited
or
a
vain
man
and
yet
he
had
often
in
his
palmy
days
imagined
how
easy
it
would
be
for
him
to
provide
for
his
own
support
he
was
something
of
a
musician
he
sang
pleasingly
he
drew
a
little
he
knew
something
of
three
or
four
modern
languages
he
had
that
sort
of
smattering
acquaintance
with
questions
of
religion
politics
and
literature
which
the
world
calls
being
and
yet
nothing
short
of
the
grave
necessity
revealed
to
him
that
towards
the
object
of
securing
a
livelihood
a
cobbler
in
his
bulk
was
his
master
the
world
has
no
need
of
the
man
of
small
acquirements
and
would
rather
have
its
shoes
mended
by
the
veriest
botch
of
a
professional
than
by
the
cleverest
amateur
that
ever
studied
a
greek
sandal
something
of
this
illusion
which
charles
lever
has
touched
so
truly
may
be
due
to
a
peculiarity
of
the
english
mind
in
its
present
not
quite
satisfactory
stage
of
development
a
peculiarity
which
i
am
not
the
first
to
point
out
since
it
has
been
already
indicated
by
pointer
the
distinguished
artist
and
i
think
that
this
peculiarity
is
to
be
found
in
very
great
force
perhaps
in
greater
force
than
elsewhere
in
that
english
middle
class
in
which
you
have
been
born
and
educated
it
consists
in
a
sort
of
indifference
to
skill
of
all
kinds
which
passes
into
something
not
very
far
from
active
contempt
when
a
call
is
made
for
attention
recognition
admiration
the
source
of
this
feeling
will
probably
be
found
in
the
inordinate
respect
for
wealth
between
which
and
highly
developed
personal
skill
in
anything
there
is
a
certain
antagonism
or
incompatibility
the
men
of
real
skill
are
almost
always
men
who
earn
their
living
by
their
skill
the
feeling
of
the
capitalists
concerning
the
skilful
man
may
be
expressed
not
unjustly
as
follows
yes
he
is
very
clever
he
may
well
be
clever
it
is
his
trade
he
gets
his
living
by
it
this
is
held
to
exonerate
us
from
the
burden
of
admiration
and
there
is
not
any
serious
interest
in
the
achievements
of
human
endeavor
as
evidence
of
the
marvellous
natural
endowments
and
capabilities
of
the
human
organism
in
some
minds
the
indifference
to
skill
is
more
active
and
grows
into
very
real
though
not
openly
expressed
contempt
this
contempt
is
partly
moral
the
skilful
man
always
rejoices
in
his
skill
with
a
joy
and
delight
one
of
the
purest
and
most
divine
pleasures
given
by
god
to
man
an
encouragement
to
labor
and
a
reward
the
best
reward
after
his
arduous
apprenticeship
but
there
is
a
sour
and
severe
spirit
hating
all
innocent
pleasures
which
despises
the
gladness
of
the
skilful
as
so
much
personal
vanity
there
is
also
the
contempt
for
skill
which
comes
from
the
pride
of
knowledge
to
attain
skill
anything
a
degree
of
application
is
necessary
which
absorbs
more
time
than
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
the
thing
so
that
the
remarkably
skilful
man
is
not
likely
to
be
the
erudite
man
there
have
been
instances
of
men
who
possessed
both
skill
and
learning
the
american
sculptor
greenough
and
the
english
painter
dyce
were
at
the
same
time
both
eminently
skilful
in
their
craft
and
eminently
learned
out
of
it
but
the
combination
is
very
rare
therefore
the
possession
of
skill
has
come
to
be
considered
presumptive
evidence
of
a
want
of
general
information
but
the
truth
is
that
professional
skill
is
knowledge
tested
and
perfected
by
practical
application
and
therefore
has
a
great
intellectual
value
professional
life
is
to
private
individuals
what
active
warfare
is
to
a
military
state
it
brings
to
light
every
deficiency
and
reveals
our
truest
needs
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
a
matter
for
regret
that
you
should
pass
your
existence
in
irresponsible
privacy
and
not
have
your
attainments
tested
by
the
exigencies
of
some
professional
career
the
discipline
which
such
a
career
affords
and
which
no
private
resolution
can
ever
adequately
replace
may
be
all
that
is
wanting
to
your
development

an

little
do
you
remember
how
put
out
byron
was
when
some
reviewer
spoke
of
wordsworth
as
being
at
the
head
of
the
profession
byron
vexation
was
not
entirely
due
to
jealousy
of
wordsworth
though
that
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
nor
was
it
due
either
to
an
aristocratic
dislike
of
being
in
a
profession
himself
though
this
feeling
may
have
had
a
certain
influence
it
was
due
to
a
proper
sense
of
the
dignity
of
the
intellectual
life
buffon
could
not
bear
to
be
called
a
naturalist
and
cuvier
in
the
same
way
disliked
the
title
of
hellenist
because
it
sounded
professional
he
said
that
though
he
knew
more
greek
than
all
the
academy
he
was
not
a
hellenist
as
gail
was
because
he
did
not
live
by
greek
now
if
this
feeling
had
arisen
merely
from
a
dislike
to
having
it
supposed
that
one
is
obliged
to
earn
his
own
living
it
would
have
been
a
contemptibly
vulgar
sentiment
whoever
professed
it
nothing
can
be
more
honorable
to
a
man
than
to
earn
his
bread
by
honest
industry
of
any
kind
whether
it
be
manual
or
intellectual
and
still
i
feel
with
byron
and
buffon
and
cuvier
that
the
great
instruments
of
the
intellectual
culture
ought
not
to
be
in
the
ordinary
sense
professions
byron
said
that
poetry
as
he
understood
it
was
an
art
an
attribute
but
not
what
is
understood
by
a
profession
surely
the
same
is
true
of
all
the
highest
intellectual
work
in
whatever
kind
you
could
scarcely
consider
faraday
life
to
be
what
is
commonly
understood
by
a
professional
life
tyndall
says
that
if
faraday
had
chosen
to
employ
his
talents
in
analytical
chemistry
he
might
have
realized
a
fortune
of
now
that
would
have
been
a
professional
existence
but
the
career
which
faraday
chose
happily
for
science
was
not
professional
but
intellectual
the
distinction
between
the
professional
and
the
intellectual
lives
is
perfectly
clear
in
my
own
mind
and
therefore
i
ought
to
be
able
to
express
it
clearly
let
me
make
the
attempt
the
purpose
of
a
profession
of
a
profession
pure
and
simple
is
to
turn
knowledge
and
talent
to
pecuniary
profit
on
the
other
hand
the
purpose
of
cultivated
men
or
men
of
genius
who
work
in
an
unprofessional
spirit
is
to
increase
knowledge
or
make
it
more
accurate
or
else
simply
to
give
free
exercise
to
high
faculties
which
demand
it
the
distinction
is
so
clear
and
trenchant
that
most
intellectual
men
whose
private
fortunes
are
not
large
prefer
to
have
a
profession
distinct
from
their
higher
intellectual
work
in
order
to
secure
the
perfect
independence
of
the
latter
mr
smiles
in
his
valuable
book
on
character
gives
a
list
of
eminent
intellectual
men
who
have
pursued
real
professional
avocations
of
various
kinds
separately
from
their
literary
or
scientific
activity
and
he
mentions
an
observation
of
gifford
which
is
much
to
my
present
purpose
gifford
the
editor
of
the
who
knew
the
drudgery
of
writing
for
a
living
once
observed
that
single
hour
of
composition
won
from
the
business
of
the
day
is
worth
more
than
the
whole
day
toil
of
him
who
works
at
the
trade
of
literature
in
the
one
case
the
spirit
comes
joyfully
to
refresh
itself
like
a
hart
to
the
in
the
other
it
pursues
its
miserable
way
panting
and
jaded
with
the
dogs
of
hunger
and
necessity
behind
so
coleridge
said
that
three
hours
of
leisure
unalloyed
by
any
alien
anxiety
and
looked
forward
to
with
delight
as
a
change
and
recreation
will
suffice
to
realize
in
literature
a
larger
product
of
what
is
truly
genial
than
weeks
of
compulsion
idea
of
a
profession
was
that
it
should
be
some
regular
employment
which
could
be
carried
on
so
far
mechanically
that
an
average
quantum
only
of
health
spirits
and
intellectual
exertion
are
requisite
to
its
faithful
discharge
without
in
the
least
desiring
to
undervalue
good
professional
work
of
any
kind
i
may
observe
that
to
be
truly
professional
it
ought
to
be
always
at
command
and
therefore
that
the
average
power
of
the
man
intellect
not
his
rare
flashes
of
highest
intellectual
illumination
ought
to
suffice
for
it
professional
work
ought
always
to
be
plain
business
work
requiring
knowledge
and
skill
but
not
any
effort
of
genius
for
example
in
medicine
it
is
professional
work
to
prescribe
a
dose
or
amputate
a
limb
but
not
to
discover
the
nervous
system
or
the
circulation
of
the
blood
if
literature
paid
sufficiently
well
to
allow
it
a
literary
man
might
very
wisely
consider
to
be
his
profession
and
not
production
he
would
then
study
regularly
say
six
hours
a
day
and
write
when
he
had
something
to
say
and
really
wanted
to
express
it
his
book
when
it
came
out
would
have
had
time
to
be
properly
hatched
and
would
probably
have
natural
life
in
it
michelet
says
of
one
of
his
books
cette
oeuvre
a
du
moins
le
caractère
venue
comme
vient
toute
vraie
création
vivante
elle
faite
à
la
chaleur
douce
incubation
it
would
be
impossible
in
so
short
a
space
to
give
a
more
accurate
description
of
the
natural
manner
in
which
a
book
comes
into
existence
a
book
ought
always
to
be
fait
à
la
chaleur
douce
incubation
but
when
you
make
a
profession
of
literature
this
is
what
you
can
hardly
ever
get
leave
to
do
literary
men
require
to
see
something
of
the
world
they
can
hardly
be
hermits
and
the
world
can
not
be
seen
without
a
constant
running
expenditure
which
at
the
end
of
the
year
represents
an
income
men
of
culture
and
refinement
really
live
like
very
poor
people
without
deteriorating
in
refinement
and
falling
behind
in
knowledge
of
the
world
when
they
are
married
and
have
families
they
can
hardly
let
their
families
live
differently
from
themselves
so
that
there
are
the
usual
expenses
of
the
english
professional
classes
to
be
met
and
these
are
heavy
when
they
have
to
be
got
out
of
the
profits
of
literature
the
consequence
is
that
if
a
book
is
to
be
written
prudently
it
must
be
written
quickly
and
with
the
least
amount
of
preparatory
labor
that
can
possibly
be
made
to
serve
this
is
very
different
from
the
of
michelet
goldsmith
said
of
that
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
a
combination
more
prejudicial
to
taste
than
that
of
the
author
whose
interest
it
is
to
write
as
much
as
possible
and
the
bookseller
whose
interest
it
is
to
pay
as
little
as
possible
the
condition
of
authors
has
no
doubt
greatly
improved
since
goldsmith
time
but
still
the
fact
remains
that
the
most
careful
and
finished
writing
requiring
extensive
preparatory
study
is
a
luxury
in
which
the
professional
writer
can
only
indulge
himself
at
great
risk
careful
writing
does
no
doubt
occasionally
pay
for
the
time
it
costs
but
such
writing
is
more
commonly
done
by
men
who
are
either
independent
by
fortune
or
who
make
themselves
as
authors
independent
by
the
pursuit
of
some
other
profession
than
by
regular
men
of
letters
whose
whole
income
is
derived
from
their
inkstands
and
when
by
way
of
exception
the
does
produce
very
and
concentrated
work
based
upon
an
elaborate
foundation
of
hard
study
that
work
is
seldom
professional
in
the
strictest
sense
but
is
a
labor
of
love
outside
the
hasty
journalism
or
that
wins
his
daily
bread
in
cases
of
this
kind
it
is
clear
that
the
best
work
is
not
done
as
a
regular
part
of
professional
duty
and
that
the
author
might
as
well
earn
his
bread
in
some
other
calling
if
he
still
had
the
same
amount
of
leisure
for
the
composition
of
real
literature
the
fault
i
find
with
writing
as
a
profession
is
that
does
not
pay
to
do
your
i
do
mean
to
insinuate
that
downright
slovenly
or
careless
work
is
the
most
profitable
but
i
do
mean
to
say
that
any
high
degree
of
conscientiousness
especially
in
the
way
of
study
and
research
is
a
direct
injury
to
the
professional
writer
purse
suppose
for
example
that
he
is
engaged
in
reviewing
a
book
and
is
to
get
for
the
review
when
it
is
written
if
by
the
accident
of
previous
accumulation
his
knowledge
is
already
fully
equal
to
the
demand
upon
it
the
review
may
be
written
rapidly
and
the
day
work
will
have
been
a
profitable
one
but
if
on
the
other
hand
it
is
necessary
to
consult
several
authorities
to
make
some
laborious
researches
then
the
reviewer
is
placed
in
a
dilemma
between
literary
thoroughness
and
duty
to
his
family
he
can
not
spend
a
week
in
reading
up
a
subject
for
the
sum
of
is
it
not
much
easier
to
string
together
a
few
phrases
which
will
effectually
hide
his
ignorance
from
everybody
but
the
enthusiasts
who
have
mastered
the
subject
of
the
book
it
is
strange
that
the
professional
pursuit
of
literature
should
be
a
direct
discouragement
to
study
yet
it
is
so
there
who
study
and
they
deserve
much
honor
for
doing
so
since
the
temptations
the
other
way
are
always
so
pressing
and
immediate
was
a
true
student
loving
literature
for
its
own
sake
and
preparing
for
his
articles
with
a
diligence
rare
in
the
profession
but
he
was
scarcely
a
having
a
modest
independency
and
living
besides
with
the
quiet
frugality
of
a
bachelor
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
literature
of
the
highest
kind
can
only
in
the
most
exceptional
cases
be
made
a
profession
yet
that
a
skilful
writer
may
use
his
pen
professionally
if
he
chooses
the
production
of
the
printed
talk
of
the
day
a
profession
requiring
no
more
than
average
ability
and
the
tone
and
temper
of
ordinary
educated
men
the
outcome
of
it
is
journalism
and
and
now
let
me
say
a
word
or
two
about
these
the
highest
kind
of
journalism
is
very
well
done
in
england
the
men
who
do
it
are
often
either
highly
educated
or
richly
gifted
by
nature
or
both
the
practice
of
journalism
is
useful
to
an
author
in
giving
him
a
degree
of
readiness
and
rapidity
a
skill
in
turning
his
materials
to
immediate
account
and
a
power
of
presenting
one
or
two
points
effectively
which
may
often
be
valuable
in
literature
of
a
more
permanent
order
the
danger
of
it
may
be
illustrated
by
a
reference
to
a
sister
art
i
was
in
the
studio
of
an
english
when
some
pictures
arrived
from
an
artist
in
the
country
to
go
along
with
his
own
to
one
of
the
exhibitions
they
were
all
very
pretty
and
very
clever
indeed
so
clever
were
they
that
their
cleverness
was
almost
offensive
and
so
long
as
they
were
looked
at
by
themselves
the
brilliance
of
them
was
rather
dazzling
but
the
instant
they
were
placed
by
the
side
of
thoroughly
careful
and
earnest
work
it
became
strikingly
evident
that
they
had
been
painted
hastily
and
would
be
almost
immediately
exhausted
by
the
purchaser
now
these
pictures
were
the
of
and
my
friend
told
me
that
when
once
an
artist
has
got
into
the
habit
of
doing
hasty
work
like
that
he
seldom
acquires
better
habits
afterwards
professional
writers
who
follow
journalism
for
its
immediate
profits
are
liable
in
like
manner
to
retain
the
habit
of
diffuseness
in
literature
which
ought
to
be
more
finished
and
more
concentrated
therefore
although
journalism
is
a
good
teacher
of
promptitude
and
decision
it
often
spoils
a
hand
for
higher
literature
by
incapacitating
it
for
perfect
finish
and
it
is
better
for
a
writer
who
has
ambition
to
write
little
always
his
than
to
dilute
himself
in
daily
columns
one
of
the
greatest
privileges
which
an
author
can
aspire
to
is
be
allowed
to
write
and
that
is
a
privilege
which
the
professional
writer
does
not
enjoy
except
in
such
rare
instances
as
that
of
tennyson
whose
careful
finish
is
as
prudent
in
the
professional
sense
as
it
is
satisfactory
to
the
scrupulous
fastidiousness
of
the

in
the
privacy
of
your
splendid
new
after
the

gone
away

the
music
had
ceased

the
night
left
me
under
the
impression
that
we
had
not
arrived
at
a
perfect
understanding
of
each
other
this
was
due
in
a
great
measure
to
my
unfortunate
incapacity
for
expressing
anything
exactly

spoken
words

constant
habit
of
writing

permits

very
unfavorable

you
permit

to
go
over

traversed

time
in
my
own
way
pen

we
represent
you
and

two
classes
which
in
their
lower
grades
are
inevitably
hostile

the
superior
members
of
these

ought
not
to
feel
any
hostility

are

of

and
to
mankind
as

baron
and

of

ages
we
are
not
recognized

of

by
formally
conferred
titles
we
are
both
held
to
be
somewhat
intrusive
by
the
representatives
of
a
former
order
of
things
and
there
is
or
was
until
very
lately
a
certain
disposition
to
deny
what
we
consider
our
natural
rights
but
we
know
that
our
powers
are
not

we

the
inward
assurance
that

us

with

there
is
a
want
of
clearness
in

temporal

accumulation
and
distribution
of
wealth
but
you
do
not
so
clearly
understand
the
spiritual
function
of
the
intellectual
class
and
you
do
not
think
of
it
quite
justly
this
want
of
understanding
is
called
by
some
of
us
your
philistinism
will
you
permit
me
to
explain
what
the
intellectual
class
thinks
of
you
and
what
is
its
opinion
about
itself
pray
excuse
any
appearance
of
presumption
on
my
part
if
i
say
we
of
the
intellectual
class
and
you
of
the
industrial
my
position
is
something
like
that
of
the
clergyman
who
reads
let
him
come
to
me
or
to
some
other
learned
and
discreet
minister
of
god
word
thereby
calling
himself
learned
and
discreet
it
is
a
simple
matter
of
fact
that
i
belong
to
the
intellectual
class
since
i
lead
its
life
just
as
it
is
a
fact
that
you
have
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
money
first
i
want
to
show
that
the
existence
of
my
class
is
necessary
although
men
in
various
occupations
often
acquire
a
considerable
degree
of
culture
outside
their
trade
the
highest
results
of
culture
can
scarcely
ever
be
attained
by
men
whose
time
is
taken
up
in
earning
a
fortune
every
man
has
but
a
limited
flow
of
mental
energy
per
day
and
if
this
is
used
up
in
an
industrial
leadership
he
can
not
do
much
more
in
the
intellectual
sphere
than
simply
ascertain
what
has
been
done
by
others
now
although
we
have
a
certain
respect
and
the
respect
is
just
for
those
who
know
what
others
have
accomplished
it
is
clear
that
if
no
one
did
more
than
this
if
no
one
made
any
fresh
discoveries
the
world
would
make
no
progress
whatever
and
in
fact
if
nobody
ever
had
been
dedicated
to
intellectual
pursuits
in
preceding
ages
the
men
who
only
learn
what
others
have
done
would
in
these
days
have
had
nothing
to
learn
past
history
proves
the
immensity
of
the
debt
which
the
world
owes
to
men
who
gave
their
whole
time
and
attention
to
intellectual
pursuits
and
if
the
existences
of
these
men
could
be
eliminated
from
the
past
of
the
human
race
its
present
would
be
very
different
from
what
it
is
a
list
has
been
published
of
men
who
have
done
much
good
work
in
the
intervals
of
business
but
still
the
fact
remains
that
the
great
intellectual
pioneers
were
absorbed
and
devoted
men
scorning
wealth
so
far
as
it
affected
themselves
and
ready
to
endure
everything
for
knowledge
beyond
the
knowledge
of
their
times
instances
of
such
enthusiasm
abound
an
enthusiasm
fully
justified
by
the
value
of
the
results
which
it
has
achieved
when
alexander
humboldt
sold
his
inheritance
to
have
the
means
for
his
great
journey
in
south
america
and
calmly
dedicated
the
whole
of
a
long
life
and
the
strength
of
a
robust
constitution
to
the
advancement
of
natural
knowledge
he
acted
foolishly
indeed
if
years
and
strength
and
fortune
are
given
to
us
only
to
be
well
invested
in
view
of
money
returns
but
the
world
has
profited
by
his
decision
faraday
gave
up
the
whole
of
his
time
to
discovery
when
he
might
have
earned
a
large
fortune
by
the
judicious
investment
of
his
extraordinary
skill
in
chemistry
livingstone
has
sacrificed
everything
to
the
pursuit
of
his
great
work
in
africa
lives
such
as
these
and
many
resemble
them
in
useful
devotion
of
which
we
hear
much
less
are
clearly
not
compatible
with
much
a
decent
existence
free
from
debt
is
all
that
such
men
ought
to
be
held
answerable
for
i
have
taken
two
or
three
leading
instances
but
there
is
quite
a
large
class
of
intellectual
people
who
can
not
in
the
nature
of
things
serve
society
effectively
in
their
own
way
without
being
quite
outside
of
the
industrial
life
there
is
a
real
incompatibility
between
some
pursuits
and
others
i
suspect
that
you
would
have
been
a
good
general
for
you
are
a
born
leader
and
commander
of
men
but
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
unite
a
regular
military
career
with
strict
personal
attention
to
your
factories
we
often
find
the
same
difficulty
in
our
intellectual
pursuits
we
are
not
always
quite
so
unpractical
as
you
think
we
are
but
the
difficulty
is
how
to
find
the
time
and
how
to
arrange
it
so
as
not
to
miss
two
or
three
distinct
classes
of
opportunities
we
are
not
all
of
us
exactly
imbeciles
in
money
matters
though
the
pecuniary
results
of
our
labors
seem
no
doubt
pitiful
enough
there
is
a
tradition
that
a
greek
philosopher
who
was
suspected
by
the
practical
men
of
his
day
of
incapacity
for
affairs
devoted
a
year
to
prove
the
contrary
and
traded
so
judiciously
that
he
amassed
thereby
great
riches
it
may
be
doubtful
whether
he
could
do
it
in
one
year
but
many
a
fine
intellectual
capacity
has
overshadowed
a
fine
practical
capacity
in
the
same
head
by
the
withdrawal
of
time
and
effort
it
is
because
the
energies
of
one
man
are
so
limited
and
there
is
so
little
time
in
a
single
human
life
that
the
intellectual
and
industrial
functions
must
their
highest
be
separated
no
one
man
could
unite
in
his
own
person
your
life
and
humboldt
though
it
is
possible
that
he
might
have
the
natural
capacity
for
both
grant
us
then
the
liberty
to
earn
very
much
money
and
this
being
once
granted
try
to
look
upon
our
intellectual
superiority
as
a
simple
natural
fact
just
as
we
look
upon
your
pecuniary
superiority
in
saying
in
this
plain
way
that
we
are
intellectually
superior
to
you
and
your
class
i
am
guilty
of
no
more
pride
and
vanity
than
you
when
you
affirm
or
display
your
wealth
the
fact
is
there
in
its
simplicity
we
have
culture
because
we
have
paid
the
twenty
or
thirty
years
of
labor
which
are
the
price
of
culture
just
as
you
have
great
factories
and
estates
which
are
the
reward
of
your
life
patient
and
intelligent
endeavor
why
should
there
be
any
narrow
jealousy
between
us
why
any
contempt
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
each
has
done
his
appointed
work
each
has
caused
to
fructify
the
talent
which
the
master
gave
yet
a
certain
jealousy
exist
if
not
between
you
and
me
personally
at
least
between
our
classes
the
men
who
have
culture
without
wealth
are
jealous
of
the
power
and
privileges
of
those
who
possess
money
without
culture
and
on
the
other
hand
the
men
whose
time
has
been
too
entirely
absorbed
by
commercial
pursuits
to
leave
them
any
margin
sufficient
to
do
justice
to
their
intellectual
powers
are
often
painfully
sensitive
to
the
contempt
of
the
cultivated
and
strongly
disposed
from
jealousy
to
undervalue
culture
itself
both
are
wrong
so
far
as
they
indulge
any
unworthy
and
unreasonable
feeling
of
this
kind
the
existence
of
the
two
classes
is
necessary
to
an
advanced
civilization
the
science
of
accumulating
and
administrating
material
wealth
of
which
you
yourself
are
a
great
practical
master
is
the
foundation
of
the
material
prosperity
of
nations
and
it
is
only
when
this
prosperity
is
fully
assured
to
great
numbers
that
the
arts
and
sciences
can
develop
themselves
in
perfect
liberty
and
with
the
tranquil
assurance
of
their
own
permanence
the
advancement
of
material
in
modern
states
tends
so
directly
to
the
advancement
of
intellectual
pursuits
even
when
the
makers
of
fortunes
are
themselves
indifferent
to
this
result
that
it
ought
always
to
be
a
matter
of
congratulation
for
the
intellectual
class
itself
which
needs
the
support
of
a
great
public
with
leisure
to
read
and
think
it
is
easy
to
show
how
those
arts
and
sciences
which
our
class
delights
to
cultivate
are
built
upon
those
developments
of
industry
which
have
been
brought
about
by
the
energy
of
yours
suppose
the
case
of
a
scientific
chemist
the
materials
for
his
experiments
are
provided
ready
to
his
hand
by
the
industrial
class
the
record
of
them
is
preserved
on
paper
manufactured
by
the
same
industrial
class
and
the
public
which
encourages
him
by
its
attention
is
usually
found
in
great
cities
which
are
maintained
by
the
labors
of
the
same
useful
servants
of
humanity
it
is
possible
no
doubt
in
these
modern
times
that
some
purely
pastoral
or
agricultural
community
might
produce
a
great
chemist
because
a
man
of
inborn
scientific
genius
who
came
into
the
world
in
an
agricultural
country
might
in
these
days
get
his
books
and
materials
from
industrial
centres
at
a
distance
but
his
work
would
still
be
based
on
the
industrial
life
of
others
no
pastoral
or
agricultural
community
which
was
really
isolated
from
industrial
communities
ever
produced
a
chemist
and
now
consider
how
enormously
important
this
one
science
of
chemistry
has
proved
itself
even
to
our
intellectual
life
several
other
sciences
have
been
either
greatly
strengthened
or
else
altogether
renewed
by
it
and
the
wonderful
photographic
processes
have
been
for
nature
and
the
fine
arts
what
printing
was
for
literature
placing
reliable
and
authentic
materials
for
study
within
the
reach
of
every
one
literature
itself
has
profited
by
the
industrial
progress
of
the
present
age
in
the
increased
cheapness
of
everything
that
is
material
in
books
i
please
myself
with
the
reflection
that
even
you
make
paper
cheaper
by
manufacturing
so
much
cotton
all
these
are
reasons
why
we
ought
not
to
be
jealous
of
you
and
now
permit
me
to
indicate
a
few
other
reasons
why
it
is
unreasonable
on
your
part
to
feel
any
jealousy
of
us
suppose
we
were
to
cease
working
cease
working
i
mean
in
our
peculiar
ways
and
all
of
us
become
colliers
and
factory
operatives
instead
with
nobody
to
supply
our
places
or
since
you
may
possibly
be
of
opinion
that
there
is
enough
literature
and
science
in
the
world
at
the
present
day
suppose
rather
that
at
some
preceding
date
the
whole
literary
and
scientific
and
artistic
labor
of
the
human
race
had
come
suddenly
to
a
standstill
mind
i
do
not
say
of
englishmen
merely
but
of
the
whole
race
for
if
any
intellectual
work
had
been
done
in
france
or
germany
or
even
in
japan
you
would
have
imported
it
like
cotton
and
foreign
cereals
well
i
have
no
hesitation
in
telling
you
that
although
there
was
a
good
deal
of
literature
and
science
in
england
before
the
of
january
the
present
condition
of
the
nation
would
have
been
a
very
chaotic
condition
if
the
intellectual
class
had
ceased
on
that
day
to
think
and
observe
and
to
place
on
record
its
thoughts
and
observations
the
life
of
a
progressive
nation
can
not
long
go
forward
exclusively
on
the
thinking
of
the
past
its
thoughtful
men
must
not
be
all
dead
men
but
living
men
who
accompany
it
on
its
course
it
is
they
who
make
clear
the
lessons
of
experience
it
is
they
who
discover
the
reliable
general
laws
upon
which
all
safe
action
must
be
founded
in
the
future
it
is
they
who
give
decision
to
human
action
in
every
direction
by
constantly
registering
in
language
of
comprehensive
accuracy
both
its
successes
and
its
failures
it
is
their
great
and
arduous
labor
which
makes
knowledge
accessible
to
men
of
action
at
the
cost
of
little
effort
and
the
smallest
possible
expenditure
of
time
the
intellectual
class
grows
in
numbers
and
in
influence
along
with
the
numbers
and
influence
of
the
materially
productive
population
of
the
state
and
not
only
are
the
natural
philosophers
the
writers
of
contemporary
and
past
history
the
discoverers
in
science
in
the
strictest
sense
to
the
life
of
such
a
community
as
the
modern
english
community
but
even
the
poets
the
novelists
the
artists
are
necessary
to
the
perfection
of
its
life
without
them
and
their
work
the
national
mind
would
be
as
incomplete
as
would
be
the
natural
universe
without
beauty
but
this
perhaps
you
will
perceive
less
clearly
or
be
less
willing
to
admit
letter
to
a
young
etonian
who
thought
of
becoming
a
absurd
old
prejudices
against
commerce
stigma
attached
to
the
great
majority
of
occupations
traditions
of
feudalism
distinctions
between
one
trade
and
another
a
real
instance
of
an
etonian
who
had
gone
into
the
observations
on
this
case
the
trade
a
fine
field
for
energy
a
poor
one
for
intellectual
culture
it
develops
practical
ability
culture
not
possible
without
leisure
the
founders
of
commercial
fortunes
it
is
agreeable
to
see
various
indications
that
the
absurd
old
prejudices
against
commerce
are
certainly
declining
there
still
remains
quite
enough
contempt
for
trade
in
the
professional
classes
and
the
aristocracy
to
give
us
frequent
opportunities
for
studying
it
as
a
relic
of
former
superstition
unhappily
not
yet
rare
enough
to
be
quite
a
curiosity
but
as
time
passes
and
people
become
more
rational
it
will
retreat
to
corners
of
old
country
mansions
and
rural
parsonages
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
centres
of
industry
it
is
a
surprising
fact
and
one
which
proves
the
almost
pathetic
spirit
of
deference
and
submission
to
superiors
which
characterizes
the
english
people
that
out
of
the
hundreds
of
occupations
which
are
followed
by
the
busy
classes
of
this
country
only
three
are
entirely
free
from
some
degrading
stigma
so
that
they
may
be
followed
by
a
youth
without
any
sacrifice
of
caste
the
wonder
is
that
the
great
active
majority
of
the
nation
the
men
who
by
their
industry
and
intelligence
have
made
england
what
she
is
should
ever
have
been
willing
to
submit
to
so
insolent
a
rule
as
this
rule
of
caste
which
instead
of
honoring
industry
honored
idleness
and
attached
a
stigma
to
the
most
useful
and
important
trades
the
landowner
the
soldier
the
priest
these
three
were
pure
from
every
stain
of
degradation
and
only
these
three
were
quite
absolutely
and
ethereally
pure
next
to
them
came
the
lawyer
and
the
physician
on
whom
there
rested
some
traces
of
the
lower
earth
so
that
although
the
youthful
baron
would
fight
or
preach
he
would
neither
plead
nor
heal
and
after
these
came
the
lower
professions
and
the
innumerable
trades
all
marked
with
stigmas
of
deeper
and
deeper
degradation
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
these
prejudices
indicate
a
state
of
society
in
which
public
opinion
has
not
emerged
from
barbarism
it
understands
the
strength
of
the
feudal
chief
having
land
with
serfs
or
voters
on
the
land
it
knows
the
uses
of
the
sword
and
it
dreads
the
menaces
of
the
priesthood
beyond
this
it
knows
little
and
despises
what
it
does
not
understand
it
is
ignorant
of
science
and
industry
and
art
it
despises
them
as
servile
occupations
beneath
its
conception
of
the
gentleman
this
is
the
tradition
of
countries
which
retain
the
impressions
of
feudalism
but
notwithstanding
all
our
philosophy
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
avoid
some
feeling
of
astonishment
when
we
reflect
that
the
public
opinion
of
england
a
country
that
owes
so
much
of
her
greatness
and
nearly
all
her
wealth
to
commercial
enterprise
should
be
contemptuous
towards
commerce
i
may
notice
in
passing
a
very
curious
form
of
this
narrowness
trade
is
despised
but
distinctions
are
established
between
one
trade
and
another
a
man
who
sells
wine
is
considered
more
of
a
gentleman
than
a
man
who
sells
figs
and
raisins
and
i
believe
you
will
find
if
you
observe
people
carefully
that
a
woollen
manufacturer
is
thought
to
be
a
shade
less
vulgar
than
a
cotton
manufacturer
these
distinctions
are
seldom
based
on
reason
for
the
work
of
commerce
is
generally
very
much
the
same
sort
of
work
mentally
whatever
may
be
the
materials
it
deals
in
you
may
be
heartily
congratulated
on
the
strength
of
mind
firmness
of
resolution
and
superiority
to
prejudice
which
have
led
you
to
choose
the
business
of
a
it
is
an
excellent
business
and
in
itself
every
whit
as
honorable
as
dealing
in
corn
and
cattle
which
our
nobles
do
habitually
without
reproach
but
now
that
i
have
disclaimed
any
participation
in
the
stupid
narrowness
which
despises
trade
in
general
and
the
in
particular
let
me
add
a
few
words
upon
the
effects
of
the
cotton
business
on
the
mind
there
appeared
in
one
of
the
newspapers
a
little
time
since
a
most
interesting
and
evidently
genuine
letter
from
an
etonian
who
had
actually
entered
business
in
a
cotton
factory
and
devoted
himself
to
it
so
as
to
earn
the
confidence
of
his
employers
and
a
salary
of
a
year
as
manager
he
had
waited
some
time
uselessly
for
a
diplomatic
appointment
which
did
not
arrive
and
so
rather
than
lose
the
best
years
of
early
manhood
as
a
more
indolent
fellow
would
have
done
very
willingly
in
pure
idleness
he
took
the
resolution
of
entering
business
and
carried
out
his
determination
with
admirable
persistence
at
first
nobody
would
believe
that
the
swell
could
be
serious
people
thought
that
his
idea
of
manufacturing
was
a
mere
freak
and
expected
him
to
abandon
it
when
he
had
to
face
the
tedium
of
the
daily
work
but
the
swell
serious
went
to
the
mill
at
six
in
the
morning
and
stayed
there
till
six
at
night
from
monday
till
saturday
inclusive
after
a
year
of
this
his
new
companions
believed
in
him
now
all
this
is
very
admirable
indeed
as
a
manifestation
of
energy
and
that
truest
independence
which
looks
to
fortune
as
the
reward
of
its
own
manly
effort
but
it
may
be
permitted
to
me
to
make
a
few
observations
on
this
young
gentleman
resolve
what
he
did
seems
to
me
rather
the
act
of
an
energetic
nature
seeking
an
outlet
for
energy
than
of
an
intellectual
nature
seeking
pasture
and
exercise
for
the
intellect
i
am
far
indeed
from
desiring
by
this
comparison
to
cast
any
disparaging
light
on
the
young
gentleman
natural
endowments
which
appear
to
have
been
valuable
in
their
order
and
robust
in
their
degree
nor
do
i
question
the
wisdom
of
his
choice
all
i
mean
to
imply
is
that
although
he
had
chosen
a
fine
large
field
for
simple
energy
it
was
a
poor
and
barren
field
for
the
intellect
to
pasture
in
consider
for
one
moment
the
difference
in
this
respect
between
the
career
which
he
had
abandoned
and
the
trade
he
had
embraced
as
an
he
would
have
lived
in
capital
cities
have
had
the
best
opportunities
for
perfecting
himself
in
modern
languages
and
for
meeting
the
most
varied
and
the
most
interesting
society
in
every
day
there
would
have
been
precious
hours
of
leisure
to
be
employed
in
the
increase
of
his
culture
if
an
intellectual
man
having
to
choose
between
diplomacy
and
preferred
it
would
be
from
the
desire
for
wealth
or
from
the
love
of
an
english
home
the
life
of
a
cotton
manufacturer
who
personally
attends
to
his
business
with
that
close
supervision
which
has
generally
conducted
to
success
leaves
scarcely
any
margin
for
intellectual
pleasure
or
spare
energy
for
intellectual
work
after
ten
hours
in
the
mill
it
is
difficult
to
sit
down
and
study
and
even
if
there
were
energy
enough
the
mind
would
not
readily
cast
off
the
burden
of
great
practical
anxieties
and
responsibilities
so
as
to
attune
itself
to
disinterested
thinking
the
leaders
of
industry
often
display
mental
power
of
as
high
an
order
as
that
which
is
employed
in
the
government
of
great
empires
they
show
the
highest
administrative
ability
they
have
to
deal
continually
with
financial
questions
which
on
their
smaller
scale
require
as
much
forethought
and
acumen
as
those
that
concern
the
exchequer
but
the
ability
they
need
is
always
strictly
practical
and
there
is
the
widest
difference
between
the
practical
and
the
intellectual
minds
a
constant
and
close
pressure
of
practical
considerations
develops
the
sort
of
power
which
deals
effectually
with
the
present
and
its
needs
but
atrophies
the
higher
mind
the
two
minds
which
we
call
intelligence
and
intellect
resemble
the
feet
and
wings
of
birds
eagles
and
swallows
walk
badly
or
not
at
all
but
they
have
a
marvellous
strength
of
flight
ostriches
are
great
pedestrians
but
they
know
nothing
of
the
regions
of
the
air
the
best
that
can
be
hoped
for
men
immersed
in
the
details
of
business
is
that
they
may
be
able
like
partridges
and
pheasants
to
take
a
short
flight
on
an
emergency
and
rise
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
above
the
level
of
the
stubble
and
the
copse
without
therefore
desiring
to
imply
any
prejudiced
contempt
for
trade
i
do
desire
to
urge
the
consideration
of
its
inevitable
effects
upon
the
mind
for
men
of
great
practical
intelligence
and
abundant
energy
trade
is
but
it
could
never
entirely
satisfy
an
intellectual
nature
and
although
there
is
drudgery
in
every
pursuit
for
even
literature
and
painting
are
full
of
it
still
there
are
certain
kinds
of
drudgery
which
intellectual
natures
find
to
be
harder
to
endure
than
others
the
drudgery
which
they
bear
least
easily
is
an
incessant
attention
to
duties
which
have
no
intellectual
interest
and
yet
which
can
not
be
properly
performed
mechanically
so
as
to
leave
the
mind
at
liberty
for
its
own
speculations
deep
thinkers
are
notoriously
absent
for
thought
requires
abstraction
from
what
surrounds
us
and
it
is
hard
for
them
to
be
denied
the
liberty
of
dreaming
an
intellectual
person
might
be
happy
as
a
on
the
roadside
because
the
work
would
leave
his
mind
at
liberty
but
he
would
certainly
be
miserable
as
an
at
a
shaft
where
the
abstraction
of
an
instant
would
imperil
the
lives
of
others
in
a
recent
address
delivered
by
gladstone
at
liverpool
he
acknowledged
the
neglect
of
culture
which
is
one
of
the
shortcomings
of
our
trading
community
and
held
out
the
hope
perhaps
in
some
degree
illusory
that
the
same
persons
might
become
eminent
in
commerce
and
in
learning
no
doubt
there
have
been
instances
of
this
and
when
a
concern
has
been
firmly
established
by
the
energy
of
a
predecessor
the
heir
to
it
may
be
satisfied
with
a
royal
sort
of
supervision
leaving
the
drudgery
of
detail
to
his
managers
and
so
secure
for
himself
that
sufficient
leisure
without
which
high
culture
is
not
possible
but
the
of
great
commercial
fortunes
have
i
believe
in
every
instance
thrown
their
energy
into
their
trade
making
wealth
their
aim
and
leaving
culture
to
be
added
in
another
generation

you

that

of
whom
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
predict
where
they
will
be
living
in
five
years
indeed
as
you
are
the
worst
of
correspondents
i
only
learned
your
present
address
by
sheer
accident
from
a
perfect
stranger
and
he
told
me
of
course
that
you
had
plans
for
going
somewhere
else
but
where
that
might
be
he
knew
not
the
civilized
english

is
usually
like

a
person
of
independent
means
rich
enough
to
bear
the
expenses
of
frequent
removals
but
without
the
cares
of
property
his
money
is
safely
invested
in
the
funds
or
in
railways
and
so
wherever
the
postman
can
bring
his
dividends
he
can
live
in
freedom
from
material
cares
when
his
wife
is
as
unsettled
as
himself
the
pair
seem
to
live
in
a
balloon
or
in
a
sort
of
noah
ark
which
goes
whither
the
wind
lists
and
takes
ground
in
the
most
unexpected
places
have
you
ever
studied
the
effect
of
localities
on
the
mind
on
your
own
mind
that
which
we
are
is
due
in
great
part
to
the
accident
of
our
surroundings
which
act
upon
us
in
one
or
two
quite
opposite
ways
either
we
feel
in
harmony
with
them
in
which
case
they
produce
a
positive
effect
upon
us
or
else
we
are
out
of
harmony
and
then
they
drive
us
into
the
strangest
reactions
a
great
ugly
english
town
like
manchester
for
instance
makes
some
men
such
thorough
townsmen
that
they
can
not
live
without
smoky
chimneys
or
it
fills
the
souls
of
others
with
such
a
passionate
longing
for
beautiful
scenery
and
rustic
retirement
that
they
find
it
absolutely
necessary
to
bury
themselves
from
time
to
time
in
the
recesses
of
picturesque
mountains
the
development
of
modern
has
not
been
due
to
habits
of
rural
existence
but
to
the
growth
of
very
big
and
hideous
modern
cities
which
made
men
long
for
shady
forests
and
pure
streams
and
magnificent
spectacles
of
sunset
and
dawn
and
moonlight
it
is
by
this
time
a
trite
observation
that
people
who
have
always
lived
in
beautiful
scenery
do
not
and
can
not
appreciate
it
that
too
much
natural
magnificence
positively
crushes
the
activity
of
the
intellect
and
that
its
best
effect
is
simply
that
of
refreshment
for
people
who
have
not
access
to
it
every
day
it
happens
too
in
a
converse
way
that
rustics
and
mountaineers
have
the
strongest
appreciation
of
the
advantages
of
great
cities
and
thrive
in
them
often
more
happily
than
citizens
who
are
born
in
the
brick
streets
those
who
have
great
facilities
for
changing
their
place
of
residence
ought
always
to
bear
in
mind
that
every
locality
is
like
a
dyer
vat
and
that
the
residents
take
its
color
or
some
other
color
from
it
just
as
the
clothes
do
that
the
dyer
steeps
in
stain
if
you
look
back
upon
your
past
life
you
will
assuredly
admit
that
every
place
has
colored
your
mental
habits
and
that
although
other
tints
from
other
places
have
supervened
so
that
it
may
be
difficult
to
say
precisely
what
remains
of
the
place
you
lived
in
many
years
ago
still
something
does
remain
like
the
effect
of
the
first
painting
on
a
picture
which
tells
on
the
whole
work
permanently
though
it
may
have
been
covered
over
and
over
again
by
what
painters
call
scumblings
and
glazings
the
selection
of
a
place
of
residence
even
though
we
only
intend
to
pass
a
few
short
years
in
it
is
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
a
matter
so
important
that
one
can
hardly
exaggerate
its
consequences
we
see
this
quite
plainly
in
the
case
of
authors
whose
minds
are
more
visible
to
us
than
the
minds
of
other
men
and
therefore
more
easily
and
conveniently
studied
we
need
no
biographer
to
inform
us
that
dickens
was
a
londoner
that
browning
had
lived
in
italy
that
ruskin
had
passed
many
seasons
in
switzerland
and
venice
suppose
for
one
moment
that
these
three
authors
had
been
born
in
ireland
and
had
never
quitted
it
is
it
not
certain
that
their
production
would
have
been
different
let
us
carry
our
supposition
farther
still
and
conceive
if
we
can
the
difference
to
their
literary
performance
if
they
had
been
born
not
in
ireland
but
in
iceland
and
lived
there
all
their
lives
is
it
not
highly
probable
that
in
this
case
their
production
would
have
been
so
starved
and
impoverished
from
insufficiency
of
material
and
of
suggestion
that
they
would
have
uttered
nothing
but
some
simple
expression
of
sentiment
and
imagination
some
homely
song
or
tale
all
sights
and
sounds
have
their
influence
on
our
temper
and
on
our
thoughts
and
our
inmost
being
is
not
the
same
in
one
place
as
in
another
we
are
like
blank
paper
that
takes
a
tint
by
reflection
from
what
is
nearest
and
changes
it
as
its
surroundings
change
in
a
dull
gray
room
how
gray
and
dull
it
looks
but
it
will
be
bathed
in
rose
or
amber
if
the
hangings
are
crimson
or
yellow
there
are
natures
that
go
to
the
streams
of
life
in
great
cities
as
the
heart
goes
to
the
there
are
other
natures
that
need
the
solitude
of
primæval
forests
and
the
silence
of
the
alps
the
most
popular
of
english
novelists
sometimes
went
to
write
in
the
tranquillity
of
beautiful
scenery
taking
his
manuscript
to
the
shore
of
some
azure
lake
in
switzerland
in
sight
of
the
eternal
snow
but
all
that
beauty
and
peace
all
that
sweetness
of
pure
air
and
color
were
not
seductive
enough
to
overcome
for
many
days
the
deep
longing
for
the
london
streets
his
genius
needed
the
streets
as
a
bee
needs
the
summer
flowers
and
languished
when
long
separated
from
them
others
have
needed
the
wild
heather
or
the
murmur
of
the
ocean
or
the
sound
of
autumn
winds
that
strip
great
who
does
not
deeply
pity
poor
heine
in
his
last
sad
years
when
he
lay
fixed
on
his
couch
of
pain
in
that
narrow
parisian
lodging
and
compared
it
to
the
sounding
grave
of
merlin
the
enchanter
which
is
situated
in
the
wood
of
brozeliande
in
brittany
under
lofty
oaks
whose
tops
taper
like
emerald
flames
towards
heaven
o
brother
merlin
he
exclaims
and
with
what
touching
pathos
o
brother
merlin
i
envy
thee
those
trees
with
their
fresh
breezes
for
never
a
green
leaf
rustles
about
this
of
mine
in
paris
where
from
morning
till
night
i
hear
nothing
but
the
rattle
of
wheels
the
clatter
of
hammers
and
the
jingling
of
pianofortes
in
the
biography
of
arnold
his
longing
for
natural
beauty
recurs
as
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
his
constitution
he
did
not
need
very
grand
scenery
though
he
enjoyed
it
deeply
but
some
wild
natural
loveliness
was
such
a
necessity
for
him
that
he
pined
for
it
unhappily
in
its
absence
rugby
could
offer
him
scarcely
anything
of
this
we
have
no
hills
he
lamented
no
plains
not
a
single
wood
and
but
one
single
copse
no
heath
no
down
no
rock
no
river
no
clear
stream
scarcely
any
flowers
for
the
lias
is
particularly
poor
in
them
nothing
but
one
endless
monotony
of
enclosed
fields
and
hedgerow
trees
this
is
to
me
a
daily
privation
it
robs
me
of
what
is
naturally
my
and
as
i
grow
older
i
begin
to
feel
it
the
positive
dulness
of
the
country
about
rugby
makes
it
to
me
a
mere
i
can
not
expatiate
there
even
in
my
walks
the
monotonous
character
of
the
midland
scenery
of
warwickshire
says
arnold
biographer
was
to
him
with
his
strong
love
of
natural
beauty
and
variety
absolutely
repulsive
there
was
something
almost
touching
in
the
eagerness
with
which
amidst
that
succession
of
fields
and
hedgerows
he
would
make
the
most
of
any
features
of
a
higher
order
in
the
pleasure
with
which
he
would
cherish
the
few
places
where
the
current
of
the
avon
was
perceptible
or
where
a
glimpse
of
the
horizon
could
be
discerned
in
the
humorous
despair
with
which
he
would
gaze
on
the
dull
expanse
of
fields
eastward
from
rugby
it
is
no
wonder
we
do
not
like
looking
that
way
when
one
considers
that
there
is
nothing
fine
between
us
and
the
ural
mountains
conceive
what
you
look
over
for
you
just
miss
sweden
and
look
over
holland
the
north
of
germany
and
the
centre
of
russia
this
dreadful
midland
monotony
impelled
arnold
to
seek
refreshment
and
compensation
in
a
holiday
home
in
the
lake
district
and
there
he
found
all
that
his
eyes
longed
for
streams
hills
woods
and
nor
had
his
belief
in
the
value
of
these
sweet
natural
surroundings
been
illusory
such
instincts
are
not
given
for
our
betrayal
and
the
soul
of
a
wise
man
knows
its
own
needs
both
before
they
are
supplied
and
after
westmorland
gave
him
all
he
had
hoped
from
it
and
more
body
and
mind
he
wrote
alike
seem
to
repose
greedily
in
delicious
quiet
without
dulness
which
we
enjoy
in
westmorland
and
again

to
do
so

very
inspiring

such
a

that
from

at

the

of

gradually
run
up

king
frederick
of
denmark
gave
him
a
delightful
island
for
his
habitation
large
enough
for
him
not
to
feel
imprisoned
the
circumference
being
about
five
miles
yet
little
enough
for
him
to
feel
as
snugly
at
home
there
as
waterton
in
his
park
the
land
was
fertile
and
rich
in
game
so
that
the
scientific
robinson
crusoe
lived
in
material
abundance
and
as
he
was
only
about
seven
miles
from
copenhagen
he
could
procure
everything
necessary
to
his
convenience
he
built
a
great
house
on
the
elevated
land
in
the
midst
of
the
isle
about
of
a
mile
from
the
sea
a
palace
of
art
and
science
with
statues
and
paintings
and
all
the
apparatus
which
the
ingenuity
of
that
age
could
contrive
for
the
advancement
of
astronomical
pursuits
uniting
the
case
of
a
rich
nobleman
existence
with
every
aid
to
science
including
special
erections
for
his
instruments
and
a
printing
establishment
that
worked
under
his
own
immediate
direction
he
lived
far
enough
from
the
capital
to
enjoy
the
most
perfect
tranquillity
yet
near
enough
to
escape
the
consequences
of
too
absolute
isolation
aided
in
all
he
undertook
by
a
staff
of
assistants
that
he
himself
had
trained
supported
in
his
labor
by
the
encouragement
of
his
sovereign
and
especially
by
his
own
unflagging
interest
in
scientific
investigation
he
led
in
that
peaceful
island
the
ideal
intellectual
life
of
that
mansion
where
he
labored
of
the
observatory
where
he
watched
the
celestial
phenomena
surrounded
but
not
disturbed
by
the
waves
of
a
shallow
sea
there
remains
at
this
day
literally
not
one
stone
upon
another
but
many
a
less
fortunate
laborer
in
the
same
field
harassed
by
poverty
distracted
by
noise
and
interruption
has
remembered
with
pardonable
envy
the
splendid
peace
of
uranienborg
it
was
one
of
the
many
fortunate
circumstances
in
the
position
of
the
two
humboldts
that
they
passed
their
youth
in
the
quiet
old
castle
of
tegel
separated
from
berlin
by
a
and
surrounded
by
walks
and
gardens
they
too
like
tycho
brahe
enjoyed
that
happy
combination
of
tranquillity
with
the
neighborhood
of
a
capital
city
which
is
so
peculiarly
favorable
to
culture
in
later
life
when
alexander
humboldt
had
collected
those
immense
masses
of
material
which
were
the
result
of
his
travels
in
south
america
he
warmly
appreciated
the
unequalled
advantages
of
paris
he
knew
how
to
extract
from
the
solitudes
of
primæval
nature
what
he
wanted
for
the
enrichment
of
his
mind
but
he
knew
also
how
to
avail
himself
of
all
the
assistance
and
opportunities
which
are
only
to
be
had
in
great
capitals
he
was
not
attracted
to
like
johnson
and
buckle
to
the
exclusion
of
wild
nature
but
neither
on
the
other
hand
had
he
that
horror
of
towns
which
was
a
morbid
defect
in
cowper
and
which
condemns
those
who
suffer
from
it
to
rusticity
even
galileo
who
thought
the
country
especially
favorable
to
speculative
intellects
and
the
walls
of
cities
an
imprisonment
for
them
declared
that
the
best
years
of
his
life
were
those
he
had
spent
in
padua

there
are
so
many
instances
of
men
who
have
been
able
to
continue
their
intellectual
labors
under
the
most
unfavorable
conditions
that
your
argument
might
be
powerfully
supported
by
an
appeal
to
actual
experience
there
is
archimedes
of
course
to
begin
with
who
certainly
seems
to
have
abstracted
himself
sufficiently
from
the
tumult
of
a
great
siege
to
forget
it
altogether
when
occupied
with
his
mathematical
problems
the
prevalent
stories
of
his
death
though
not
identical
point
evidently
to
a
habit
of
abstraction
which
had
been
remarked
as
a
peculiarity
by
those
about
him
and
it
is
probable
enough
that
a
great
inventor
in
engineering
would
follow
his
usual
speculations
under
circumstances
which
though
dangerous
had
lasted
long
enough
to
become
habitual
even
modern
warfare
which
from
the
use
of
gunpowder
is
so
much
noisier
than
that
which
raged
at
syracuse
does
not
hinder
men
from
thinking
and
writing
when
they
are
used
to
it
geoffrey
hilaire
never
worked
more
steadily
and
regularly
in
his
whole
life
than
he
did
in
the
midst
of
the
besieged
city
of
alexandria
knowledge
is
so
sweet
he
said
long
afterwards
in
speaking
of
this
experience
that
it
never
entered
my
thoughts
how
a
bombshell
might
in
an
instant
have
cast
into
the
abyss
both
me
and
my
documents
by
good
luck
two
electric
fish
had
been
caught
and
given
to
him
just
then
so
he
immediately
began
to
make
experiments
as
if
he
had
been
in
his
own
cabinet
in
paris
and
for
three
weeks
he
thought
of
nothing
else
utterly
forgetting
the
fierce
warfare
that
filled
the
air
with
thunder
and
flame
and
the
streets
with
victims
he
had
hypotheses
to
amuse
him
and
it
was
necessary
to
review
his
whole
scientific
acquirement
with
reference
to
each
of
these
as
he
considered
them
one
by
one
it
may
be
doubted
however
whether
he
was
more
in
danger
from
the
bombardment
or
from
the
intensity
of
his
own
mental
concentration
he
grew
thin
and
haggard
slept
one
hour
in
the
and
lived
in
a
perilous
condition
of
nervous
strain
and
excitement
goethe
at
the
bombardment
of
verdun
letting
his
mind
take
its
own
course
found
that
it
did
not
occupy
itself
with
tragedies
or
with
anything
suggested
by
what
was
passing
in
the
conflict
around
him
but
by
scientific
considerations
about
the
phenomena
of
colors
he
noticed
in
a
passing
observation
the
bad
effect
of
war
upon
the
mind
how
it
makes
people
destructive
one
day
and
creative
the
next
how
it
accustoms
them
to
phases
intended
to
excite
hope
in
desperate
circumstances
thus
producing
a
peculiar
sort
of
hypocrisy
different
from
the
priestly
and
courtly
kind
this
is
the
extent
of
his
interest
in
the
war
but
when
he
finds
some
soldiers
fishing
he
is
attracted
to
the
spot
and
profoundly
occupied
not
with
the
soldiers
but
with
the
optical
phenomena
on
the
water
he
was
never
very
much
moved
by
external
events
nor
did
he
take
that
intense
interest
in
the
politics
of
the
day
which
we
often
find
in
people
less
studious
of
literature
and
science
raimond
lullo
the
oriental
missionary
continued
to
write
many
volumes
in
the
midst
of
the
most
continual
difficulties
and
dangers
preserving
as
much
mental
energy
and
clearness
as
if
he
had
been
safe
and
tranquil
in
a
library
giordano
bruno
worked
constantly
also
in
the
midst
of
political
troubles
and
religious
persecutions
and
his
biographer
tells
us
that
il
desiderio
vivissimo
della
scienza
aveva
ben
più
efficacia
sull
animo
del
bruno
che
non
gli
avvenimenti
esterni
these
examples
which
have
just
occurred
to
me
and
many
others
that
it
would
be
easy
to
collect
may
be
taken
to
prove
at
least
so
much
as
this
that
it
is
possible
to
be
absorbed
in
private
studies
when
surrounded
by
the
most
disturbing
influences
but
even
in
these
cases
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
conclude
that
the
surroundings
had
no
effect
whatever
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
geoffroy
hilaire
was
intensely
excited
by
the
siege
of
alexandria
though
he
may
not
have
attributed
his
excitement
to
that
cause
his
mind
was
occupied
with
the
electrical
fishes
but
his
nervous
system
was
wrought
upon
by
the
siege
and
kept
in
that
state
of
tension
which
at
the
same
time
enabled
him
to
get
through
a
gigantic
piece
of
intellectual
labor
and
made
him
incapable
of
rest
had
this
condition
been
prolonged
it
must
have
terminated
either
in
exhaustion
or
in
madness
men
have
often
engaged
in
literature
or
science
to
escape
the
pressure
of
anxiety
which
strenuous
mental
labor
permits
us
at
least
temporarily
to
forget
but
the
circumstances
which
surround
us
have
invariably
an
influence
of
some
kind
upon
our
thinking
though
the
connection
may
not
be
obvious
even
in
the
case
of
goethe
who
could
study
optics
on
a
his
english
biographer
recognizes
the
effect
of
the
frankfort
life
which
surrounded
the
great
author
in
his
childhood
the
old
frankfort
city
with
its
busy
crowds
its
fairs
its
mixed
population
and
its
many
sources
of
excitement
offered
great
temptations
and
great
pasture
to
so
desultory
a
genius
this
is
perhaps
a
case
wherein
circumstances
may
be
seen
influencing
the
direction
of
character
a
large
continuity
of
thought
and
effort
was
perhaps
radically
uncongenial
to
such
a
temperament
yet
one
can
not
help
speculating
whether
under
other
circumstances
he
might
not
have
achieved
it
had
he
been
reared
in
a
quiet
little
old
german
town
where
he
would
have
daily
seen
the
same
faces
in
the
silent
streets
and
come
in
contact
with
the
same
characters
his
culture
might
have
been
less
various
but
it
might
perhaps
have
been
deeper
had
he
been
reared
in
the
country
with
only
the
changing
seasons
and
the
sweet
serenities
of
nature
to
occupy
his
attention
when
released
from
study
he
would
certainly
have
been
a
different
poet
the
long
summer
afternoons
spent
in
lonely
rambles
the
deepening
twilights
filled
with
shadowy
visions
the
slow
uniformity
of
his
external
life
necessarily
throwing
him
more
and
more
upon
the
subtler
diversities
of
inward
experience
would
inevitably
have
influenced
his
genius
in
quite
different
directions
would
have
animated
his
works
with
a
very
different
spirit
we
are
sometimes
told
that
life
in
a
great
capital
is
essential
to
the
development
of
genius
but
frankfort
was
the
largest
town
goethe
ever
lived
in
and
he
never
visited
either
paris
or
london
much
of
the
sanity
of
his
genius
may
have
been
due
to
his
residence
in
so
tranquil
a
place
as
weimar
where
he
could
shut
himself
up
in
his
and
lock
all
the
gates
of
the
bridge
over
the
ilm
the
solitude
says
lewes
is
absolute
broken
only
by
the
occasional
sound
of
the
church
clock
the
music
from
the
barracks
and
the
screaming
of
the
peacocks
spreading
their
superb
beauty
in
the
park
few
men
of
genius
have
been
happier
in
their
surroundings
than
goethe
he
had
tranquillity
and
yet
was
not
deprived
of
intellectual
intercourse
the
scenery
within
from
his
home
was
interesting
and
even
inspiring
yet
not
so
splendid
as
to
be
overwhelming
we
know
from
his
conversations
that
he
was
quite
aware
of
the
value
of
those
little
centres
of
culture
to
germany
and
yet
in
one
place
he
speaks
of
béranger
in
the
tone
which
seems
to
imply
an
appreciation
of
the
larger
life
of
paris
fancy
he
says
this
same
béranger
away
from
paris
and
the
influence
and
opportunities
of
a
born
as
the
son
of
a
poor
tailor
at
jena
or
weimar
let
him
run
his
wretched
career
in
either
of
the
two
small
cities
and
see
what
fruit
would
have
grown
on
such
a
soil
and
in
such
an
atmosphere
we
can
not
too
frequently
be
reminded
that
we
are
nothing
of
ourselves
and
by
ourselves
and
are
only
something
by
the
place
we
hold
in
the
intellectual
chain
of
humanity
by
which
electricity
is
conveyed
to
us
and
through
us
to
be
increased
in
the
transmission
if
we
have
great
natural
power
and
are
favorably
situated
but
not
otherwise
a
child
is
born
to
the
vecelli
family
at
cadore
and
when
it
is
nine
years
old
is
taken
to
venice
and
placed
under
the
tuition
of
sebastian
zuccato
afterwards
he
goes
to
bellini
school
and
there
gets
acquainted
with
another
student
one
year
his
junior
whose
name
is
barbarelli
they
live
together
and
work
together
in
venice
then
young
barbarelli
known
to
posterity
as
giorgione

putting
on
certain
spaces
of

squares
of

the
world
had
never
before
seen

early
manhood

whom
we
call
titian
to
work
on
there
in

till
the
plague
stays
his
hand
in
his
hundredth
year
the
genius
came
into
the
world
but
all
the
possibilities
of
his
development
depended
upon
the
place
and
the
time
he
came
exactly
in
the
right
place
and
precisely
at
the
right
time
to
be
born
not
far
from
venice
in
the
days
of
bellini
to
be
taken
there
at
nine
years
old
to
have
giorgione
for
one
comrade
all
this
was
as
fortunate
for
an
artistic
career
as
the
circumstances
of
alexander
of

were
for

find

happiness
of

and
they
usually
dream
of
it
and
plan
it
several
years
before
the
dream
is
realized
only
a
few
days
ago
i
was
talking
on
this
very
subject
with
an
intellectual
friend
who
is
not
an
artist
and
who
maintained
that
the
love
of
fine
studios
is
in
great
part
a
mere
illusion
he
admitted
the
necessity
for
size
and
for
a
proper
kind
of
light
but
laughed
at
carved
oak
and
tapestry
and
armor
and
the
knicknacks
that
artists
encumber
themselves
with
he
would
have
it
that
a
mind
thoroughly
occupied
with
its
own
business
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
objects
that
surrounded
it
and
he
cited
two
examples
saint
bernard
who
travelled
all
day
by
the
shore
of
lake
leman
without
seeing
it
and
the
ravignan
who
worked
in
a
bare
little
room
with
a
common
table
of
blackened
pine
and
a
cheap
chair
on
this
i
translated
to
him
from
goethe
life
by
lewes
a
passage
which
was
new
to
him
and
delighted
him
as
a
confirmation
of
his
theory

biographer
describes
the
poet

as
a
narrow
room
somewhat
dark

it
is
lighted
only
through

its
side
and
a
tiny
with
a
small
white
basin
on
it
and
a
sponge
is
all
the
furniture
to
enter
this
room
with
any
feeling
for
the
greatness
and
goodness
of
him
who
slept
here
and
who
here
slept
his
last
sleep
brings
tears
into
our
eyes
and
makes
the
breathing
deep
when
i
had
finished
reading
this
passage
my
friend
exclaimed
triumphantly
there
do
you
see
that
it
was
just
because
goethe
had
imaginative
power
of
a
strong
and
active
kind
that
he
cared
nothing
about
what
surrounded
him
when
he
worked
he
had
statues
and
pictures
to
occupy
his
mind
when
it
was
disengaged
but
when
he
wrote
he
preferred
that
bare
little
cell
where
nothing
was
to
be
seen
that
could
distract
his
attention
for
an
instant
depend
upon
it
goethe
acted
in
this
matter
either
from
a
deliberate
and
most
wise
calculation
or
else
from
the
sure
instinct
of
genius
whilst
we
were
on
this
subject
i
thought
over
other
instances
and
remembered
my
surprise
on
visiting
gustave
doré
in
his
in
paris
doré
has
a
gothic
exuberance
of
imagination
so
i
expected
a
something
like
victor
hugo
house
rather
barbarous
but
very
rich
and
interesting
with
plenty
of
carved
cabinets
and
tapestry
and
as
they
call
picturesque
curiosities
in
paris
to
my
surprise
there
was
nothing
except
canvases
and
easels
but
a
small
deal
table
on
which
tubes
of
were
thrown
in
disorder
and
two
cheap
chairs
here
evidently
the
pleasure
of
painting
was
sufficient
to
occupy
the
artist
and
in
the
room
where
he
made
his
illustrations
the
characteristics
were
simplicity
and
good
practical
arrangements
for
order
but
there
was
nothing
to
amuse
the
imagination
leslie
used
to
paint
in
a
room
which
was
just
like
any
other
in
the
house
and
had
none
of
the
peculiarities
of
a
studio
turner
did
not
care
in
the
least
what
sort
of
a
room
he
painted
in
provided
it
had
a
door
and
a
bolt
on
the
inside
scott
could
write
anywhere
even
in
the
family
with
talk
going
forward
as
usual
and
after
he
had
finished
abbotsford
he
did
not
write
in
any
of
its
rich
and
noble
rooms
but
in
a
simple
closet
with
round
it
dickens
wrote
in
a
comfortable
room
well
lighted
and
cheerful
and
he
liked
to
have
funny
little
bronzes
on
his
the
best
way
appears
to
be
to
surround
ourselves
whenever
it
can
be
conveniently
done
with
whatever
we
know
by
experience
to
be
favorable
to
our
work
i
think
the
barest
cell
monk
ever
prayed
in
would
be
a
good
place
for
imaginative
composition
and
so
too
would
be
the
most
magnificent
rooms
in
chatsworth
or
blenheim
a
middling
sort
of
place
with
a
philistine
character
vulgar
upholstery
and
vulgar
pictures
or
engravings
is
really
dangerous
because
these
things
often
attract
attention
in
the
intervals
of
labor
and
occupy
it
in
a
mean
way
an
artist
is
always
the
better
for
having
something
that
may
profitably
amuse
and
occupy
his
eye
when
he
quits
his
picture
and
i
think
it
is
a
right
instinct
which
leads
artists
to
surround
themselves
with
many
picturesque
and
beautiful
things
not
too
orderly
in
their
arrangement
so
that
there
may
be
pleasant
surprises
for
the
eye
as
there
are
in
nature
for
literary
men
there
is
nothing
so
valuable
as
a
window
with
a
cheerful
and
beautiful
prospect
it
is
good
for
us
to
have
this
refreshment
for
the
eye
when
we
leave
off
working
and
montaigne
did
wisely
to
have
his
study
up
in
a
tower
from
which
he
had
extensive
views
there
is
a
objection
to
extensive
views
as
wanting
in
snugness
and
comfort
but
this
objection
scarcely
applies
to
the
especial
case
of
literary
men
what
we
want
is
not
so
much
snugness
as
relief
refreshment
suggestion
and
we
get
these
as
a
general
rule
much
better
from
wide
prospects
than
from
limited
ones
i
have
just
alluded
to
montaigne
will
you
permit
me
to
imitate
that
dear
old
philosopher
in
his
egotism
and
describe
to
you
the
view
from
the
room
i
write
in
which
cheers
and
amuses
me
continually
but
before
describing
this
let
me
describe
another
of
which
the
recollection
is
very
dear
to
me
and
as
vivid
as
a
picture
in
years
gone
by
i
had
only
to
look
up
from
my
desk
and
see
a
noble
loch
in
its
inexhaustible
loveliness
and
a
mountain
in
its
majesty
it
was
a
daily
and
hourly
delight
to
watch
the
breezes
play
about
the
enchanted
isles
on
the
delicate
silvery
surface
dimming
some
clear
reflection
or
trailing
it
out
in
length
or
cutting
sharply
across
it
with
acres
of
rippling
blue
it
was
a
frequent
pleasure
to
see
the
clouds
play
about
the
crest
of
cruachan
and
ben
vorich
golden
head
gray
mists
that
crept
upwards
from
the
valleys
till
the
sunshine
suddenly
caught
them
and
made
them
brighter
than
the
snows
they
shaded
and
the
leagues
and
leagues
of
heather
on
the
lower
land
to
the
southward
that
became
like
the
aniline
dyes
of
deepest
purple
and
blue
when
the
sky
was
gray
in
the
evening
all
save
one
ah
those
were
spectacles
never
to
be
forgotten
splendors
of
light
and
glory
and
sadness
of
deepening
gloom
when
the
eyes
grew
moist
in
the
twilight
and
secretly
drank
their
tears
and
yet
wonderful
as
it
was
that
noble
and
passionately
beloved
highland
scenery
was
wanting
in
one
great
element
that
a
writer
imperatively
needs
in
all
that
natural
magnificence
humanity
held
no
place
hidden
behind
a
promontory
to
the
north
there
still
remained
it
is
true
the
gray
ruin
of
old
kilchurn
and
far
to
the
in
another
reach
of
the
lake
the
of
ardhonnel
but
there
was
not
a
visible
city
with
spires
and
towers
there
were
only
the
on
the
little
islands
and
a
few
gravestones
on
the
largest
beyond
were
the
depopulated
deserts
of
breadalbane
here
where
i
write
to
you
now
it
seems
as
if
mankind
were
nearer
and
the
legends
of
the
ages
written
out
for
me
on
the
surface
of
the
world
under
the
shadow
of
jove
hill
rises
before
me
one
of
the
most
ancient
of
european
cities
et
æmula
she
bears
on
her
walls
and
edifices
the
record
of
sixty
generations
temple
and
arch
and
pyramid
all
these
bear
witness
still
and
so
do
her
ancient
bulwarks
and
many
a
stately
tower
high
above
all
the
cathedral
spire
is
drawn
dark
in
the
morning
mist
and
often
in
the
clear
summer
evenings
it
comes
brightly
in
slanting
sunshine
against
the
steep
woods
behind
then
the
old
city
arrays
herself
in
the
warmest
and
mellowest
tones
and
glows
as
the
shadows
fall
she
reigns
over
the
whole
width
of
her
valley
to
the
folds
of
the
far
blue
hills
even
so
ought
our
life
to
be
surrounded
by
the
loveliness
of
nature
surrounded
but
not
subdued
