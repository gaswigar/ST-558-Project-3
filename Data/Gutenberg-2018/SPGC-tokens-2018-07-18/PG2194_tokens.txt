preface
mauprat
george
sand
napoleon
in
exile
declared
that
were
he
again
on
the
throne
he
should
make
a
point
of
spending
two
hours
a
day
in
conversation
with
women
from
whom
there
was
much
to
be
learnt
he
had
no
doubt
several
types
of
women
in
mind
but
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
banishment
of
madame
de
stael
rose
before
him
as
one
of
the
mistakes
in
his
career
it
was
not
that
he
showed
lack
of
judgment
merely
by
the
persecution
of
a
rare
talent
but
by
failing
to
see
that
the
rare
talent
was
pointing
out
truths
very
valuable
to
his
own
safety
this
is
what
happened
in
france
when
george
sand
the
greatest
woman
writer
the
world
has
known
or
is
ever
likely
to
know
was
attacked
by
the
orthodox
critics
of
her
time
they
feared
her
warnings
they
detested
her
sincerity
a
sincerity
displayed
as
much
in
her
life
as
in
her
works
the
hypocrite
s
paradise
was
precisely
her
idea
of
hell
they
resented
bitterly
an
independence
of
spirit
which
in
a
man
would
have
been
in
the
highest
degree
distinguished
which
remained
under
every
test
untamable
with
a
kind
of
which
one
can
only
compare
with
fielding
s
with
a
passion
as
great
as
montaigne
s
for
acknowledging
the
truths
of
experience
with
an
absence
of
truly
amazing
in
the
artistic
temperament
of
either
sex
she
wrote
exactly
as
she
thought
saw
and
felt
humour
was
not
her
strong
point
she
had
an
exultant
joy
in
living
but
laughter
whether
genial
or
sardonic
is
not
in
her
work
irony
she
seldom
if
ever
employed
satire
she
never
attempted
it
was
on
the
maternal
the
sympathetic
side
that
her
femininity
and
therefore
her
creative
genius
was
most
strongly
developed
she
was
masculine
only
in
the
deliberate
libertinism
of
certain
episodes
in
her
own
life
this
was
a
characteristic
one
on
no
account
to
be
overlooked
or
denied
or
disguised
but
it
was
not
her
character
the
character
was
womanly
tender
exquisitely
patient
and
she
would
take
cross
humanity
in
her
arms
and
carry
it
out
into
the
sunshine
of
the
fields
she
would
show
it
flowers
and
birds
sing
songs
to
it
tell
it
stories
recall
its
original
beauty
even
in
her
moods
of
depression
and
revolt
one
recognises
the
fatigue
of
the
strong
it
is
never
for
a
moment
the
lassitude
of
the
feeble
the
weary
spite
of
a
sick
and
soul
as
she
was
free
from
personal
vanity
she
was
also
free
from
hysteria
on
marriage
the
one
subject
which
drove
her
to
a
certain
though
always
disciplined
violence
she
clearly
felt
more
for
others
than
they
felt
for
themselves
and
in
observing
certain
households
and
life
partnerships
she
may
have
been
afflicted
with
a
dismay
which
the
unreflecting
sufferers
did
not
share
no
writer
who
was
carried
away
by
egoistic
anger
or
disappointment
could
have
told
these
stories
of
unhappiness
infidelity
and
luckless
love
with
such
dispassionate
lucidity
with
the
artist
s
dislike
of
all
that
is
positive
and
arbitrary
she
was
nevertheless
subject
rather
to
her
intellect
than
her
emotions
an
insult
to
her
intelligence
was
the
one
thing
she
found
it
hard
to
pardon
and
she
allowed
no
external
interference
to
disturb
her
relations
with
her
own
reasoning
faculty
she
followed
caprices
no
doubt
but
she
was
never
under
any
apprehension
with
regard
to
their
true
nature
displaying
in
this
respect
a
detachment
which
is
usually
considered
exclusively
virile
et
which
perhaps
because
it
is
short
and
associated
with
actual
facts
is
the
most
frequently
discussed
in
general
conversation
on
her
work
remains
probably
the
sanest
account
of
a
sentimental
experiment
which
was
ever
written
how
far
it
may
have
seemed
accurate
to
de
musset
is
not
to
the
point
her
version
of
her
grievance
is
at
least
convincing
without
fear
and
without
hope
she
makes
her
statement
and
it
stands
therefore
unique
of
its
kind
among
indictments
it
has
been
said
that
her
fault
was
an
excess
of
emotionalism
that
is
to
say
she
attached
too
much
importance
to
mere
feeling
and
described
it
in
french
of
marvellous
ease
and
beauty
with
a
good
deal
of
something
else
which
one
can
almost
condemn
as
the
not
that
the
is
of
necessity
unnatural
but
it
is
misleading
it
places
the
passing
mood
the
lyrical
note
dependent
on
so
many
accidents
above
the
essential
temperament
and
the
dominant
chord
which
depend
on
life
only
where
she
falls
short
of
the
very
greatest
masters
is
in
this
all
but
deliberate
confusion
of
things
which
must
change
or
can
be
changed
with
things
which
are
unchangeable
incurable
and
permanent
shakespeare
it
is
true
makes
all
his
villains
talk
poetry
but
it
is
the
poetry
which
a
villain
were
he
a
poet
would
inevitably
write
george
sand
glorifies
every
mind
with
her
own
peculiar
fire
and
tears
the
fire
is
fortunately
so
much
stronger
than
the
tears
that
her
passion
never
degenerates
into
the
maudlin
all
the
same
she
makes
too
universal
a
use
of
her
own
strongest
gifts
and
this
is
why
she
can
not
be
said
to
excel
as
a
portrait
painter
one
merit
however
is
certain
if
her
earliest
writings
were
dangerous
it
was
because
of
her
wonderful
power
of
idealization
not
because
she
filled
her
pages
with
the
revolting
and
epicene
sensuality
of
the
new
italian
french
and
english
schools
intellectual
viciousness
was
not
her
failing
and
she
never
made
the
modern
mistake
of
confusing
indecency
with
vigour
she
loved
nature
air
and
light
too
well
and
too
truly
to
go
very
far
wrong
in
her
imaginations
it
may
indeed
be
impossible
for
many
of
us
to
accept
all
her
social
and
political
views
they
have
no
bearing
fortunately
on
the
quality
of
her
literary
art
they
have
to
be
considered
under
a
different
aspect
in
politics
her
judgment
as
displayed
in
the
letters
to
mazzini
was
profound
her
correspondence
with
flaubert
shows
us
a
capacity
for
stanch
unblemished
friendship
unequalled
probably
in
the
biographies
whether
published
or
unpublished
of
the
remarkable
with
regard
to
her
impiety
for
such
it
should
be
called
it
did
not
arise
from
arrogance
nor
was
it
based
in
any
way
upon
the
higher
learning
of
her
period
simply
she
did
not
possess
the
religious
instinct
she
understood
it
sympathetically
in
for
instance
she
describes
an
ascetic
nature
as
it
has
never
been
done
in
any
other
work
of
fiction
newman
himself
has
not
written
passages
of
deeper
or
purer
mysticism
of
more
sincere
spirituality
balzac
in
attempted
something
of
the
kind
but
the
result
was
never
more
than
a
de
he
could
invent
he
could
describe
but
george
sand
felt
and
as
she
felt
she
composed
living
with
and
loving
with
an
understanding
love
all
her
creations
but
it
has
to
be
remembered
always
that
she
repudiated
all
religious
restraint
that
she
believed
in
the
human
heart
that
she
acknowledged
no
higher
law
than
its
own
impulses
that
she
saw
love
where
others
see
only
a
cruel
struggle
for
existence
that
she
found
beauty
where
ordinary
visions
can
detect
little
besides
a
selfishness
worse
than
brutal
and
a
squalor
more
pitiful
than
death
everywhere
she
insists
upon
the
purifying
influence
of
affection
no
matter
how
degraded
in
its
circumstances
or
how
illegal
in
its
manifestation
no
writer
not
excepting
the
brontes
has
shown
a
deeper
sympathy
with
uncommon
temperaments
misunderstood
aims
consciences
with
flickering
lights
the
discontented
the
abnormal
or
the
unhappy
the
great
modern
specialist
for
nervous
diseases
has
not
improved
on
her
analysis
of
the
neuropathic
and
hysterical
there
is
scarcely
a
novel
of
hers
in
which
some
character
does
not
appear
who
is
in
the
usual
phrase
out
of
the
common
run
yet
with
this
perfect
understanding
of
the
exceptional
case
she
never
permits
any
science
of
cause
and
effect
to
obscure
the
rules
and
principles
which
in
the
main
control
life
for
the
majority
it
was
no
doubt
this
balance
which
made
her
a
popular
writer
even
while
she
never
ceased
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
most
acute
minds
of
france
she
possessed
in
addition
to
creative
genius
of
an
order
especially
individual
and
charming
a
capacity
for
the
invention
of
ideas
there
are
in
many
of
her
chapters
more
ideas
more
suggestions
than
one
would
find
in
a
whole
volume
of
flaubert
it
is
not
possible
that
these
surprising
admirable
and
usually
sound
thoughts
were
the
result
of
long
hours
of
reflection
they
belonged
to
her
nature
and
a
quality
of
judgment
which
even
in
her
most
extravagant
romances
is
never
for
a
moment
swayed
from
that
sane
impartiality
described
by
the
unobservant
as
common
sense
her
fairness
to
women
was
not
the
least
astounding
of
her
gifts
she
is
kind
to
the
beautiful
the
yielding
above
all
to
the
very
young
and
in
none
of
her
stories
has
she
introduced
any
violently
disagreeable
female
characters
her
villains
are
mostly
men
and
even
these
she
invests
with
a
picturesque
fatality
which
drives
them
to
errors
crimes
and
scoundrelism
with
a
certain
plaintive
if
relentless
grace
the
inconstant
lover
is
invariably
pursued
by
the
furies
of
remorse
the
brutal
has
always
some
mitigating
influence
in
his
career
the
libertine
retains
through
many
vicissitudes
a
seraphic
love
for
some
faithful
solveig
humanity
meant
far
more
to
her
than
art
she
began
her
literary
career
by
describing
facts
as
she
knew
them
critics
drove
her
to
examine
their
causes
and
so
she
gradually
changed
from
the
chronicler
with
strong
sympathies
to
the
interpreter
with
a
reasoned
philosophy
she
discovered
that
a
great
deal
of
the
suffering
in
this
world
is
due
not
so
much
to
original
sin
but
to
a
kind
of
original
stupidity
an
unimaginative
stubborn
stupidity
people
were
dishonest
because
they
believed
wrongly
that
dishonesty
was
somehow
successful
they
were
cruel
because
they
supposed
that
repulsive
exhibitions
of
power
inspired
a
prolonged
fear
they
were
treacherous
because
they
had
never
been
taught
the
greater
strength
of
candour
george
sand
tried
to
point
out
the
advantage
of
plain
dealing
and
the
natural
goodness
of
mankind
when
uncorrupted
by
a
false
education
she
loved
the
wayward
and
the
desolate
pretentiousness
in
any
disguise
was
the
one
thing
she
suspected
and
could
not
tolerate
it
may
be
questioned
whether
she
ever
deceived
herself
but
it
must
be
said
that
on
the
whole
she
flattered
weakness
and
excused
by
enchanting
eloquence
much
which
can
not
always
be
justified
merely
on
the
ground
that
it
is
explicable
but
to
explain
was
something
all
but
everything
at
the
time
of
her
appearance
in
literature
every
novel
she
wrote
made
for
charity
for
a
better
acquaintance
with
our
neighbour
s
woes
and
our
own
egoism
such
an
attitude
of
mind
is
only
possible
to
an
absolutely
frank
even
arcadian
nature
she
did
what
she
wished
to
do
she
said
what
she
had
to
say
not
because
she
wanted
to
provoke
excitement
or
astonish
the
multitude
but
because
she
had
succeeded
eminently
in
leading
her
own
life
according
to
her
own
lights
the
terror
of
appearing
inconsistent
excited
her
scorn
appearances
never
troubled
that
unashamed
soul
this
is
the
magic
the
peculiar
fascination
of
her
books
we
find
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
a
freshness
a
primeval
vigour
which
produces
actually
the
effect
of
seeing
new
scenes
of
facing
a
fresh
climate
her
love
of
the
soil
of
flowers
and
the
sky
for
whatever
was
young
and
unspoilt
seems
to
animate
every
page
even
in
her
passages
of
rhetorical
sentiment
we
never
suspect
the
burning
pastille
the
gauze
or
the
depressed
pink
light
rhetoric
it
may
be
but
it
is
the
rhetoric
of
the
sea
and
the
wheat
field
it
can
be
spoken
in
the
open
air
and
read
by
the
light
of
day
george
sand
never
confined
herself
to
any
especial
manner
in
her
literary
work
her
spontaneity
of
feeling
and
the
actual
fecundity
as
it
were
of
her
imaginative
gift
could
not
be
restrained
concentrated
and
formally
arranged
as
it
was
in
the
case
of
the
two
first
masters
of
modern
french
her
work
in
this
respect
may
be
compared
to
a
gold
mine
while
theirs
is
rather
the
goldsmith
s
craft
it
must
not
be
supposed
however
that
she
was
a
writer
without
very
strong
views
with
regard
to
the
construction
of
a
plot
and
the
development
of
character
her
literary
essays
and
reviews
show
a
knowledge
of
technique
which
could
be
accepted
at
any
time
as
a
for
the
critics
and
the
criticised
she
knew
exactly
how
artistic
effects
were
obtained
how
and
why
certain
things
were
done
why
realism
could
never
be
anything
but
caricature
and
why
of
small
matters
can
never
be
otherwise
than
disproportionate
nothing
could
be
more
just
than
her
saying
about
balzac
that
he
was
such
a
logician
that
he
invented
things
more
truthful
than
the
truth
itself
no
one
knew
better
than
she
that
the
truth
as
it
is
commonly
understood
does
not
exist
that
it
can
not
be
logical
because
of
its
mystery
and
that
it
is
the
knowledge
of
its
contradictions
which
shows
the
real
expert
in
psychology
three
of
her
stories
petite
mare
au
and
maitres
are
as
neat
in
their
workmanship
as
a
dutch
painting
her
brilliant
powers
of
analysis
the
intellectual
atmosphere
with
which
she
surrounds
the
more
complex
characters
in
her
longer
romances
are
entirely
put
aside
and
we
are
given
instead
a
series
of
pictures
and
dialogues
in
what
has
been
called
the
purely
objective
style
so
pure
in
its
objectivity
and
detachment
that
it
would
be
hard
for
any
one
to
decide
from
internal
evidence
that
they
were
in
reality
her
own
composition
to
those
who
seek
for
proportion
and
form
there
is
without
doubt
much
that
is
unsymmetrical
in
her
designs
interesting
she
always
is
but
to
the
trained
eye
scenes
of
minor
importance
are
strictly
speaking
too
long
descriptions
in
musical
language
sometimes
distract
the
reader
from
the
progress
of
the
story
but
this
arose
from
her
own
joy
in
writing
much
as
she
valued
proportion
she
liked
expressing
her
mind
better
not
out
of
conceit
or
but
as
the
birds
whom
she
loved
so
well
sing
good
nature
is
what
we
need
above
all
in
reading
george
sand
it
is
there
infectious
enough
in
her
own
pages
and
with
it
the
courage
which
can
come
only
from
a
heart
at
peace
with
itself
this
is
why
neither
fashion
nor
new
nor
old
criticism
can
affect
the
title
of
george
sand
among
the
greatest
influences
of
the
last
century
and
the
present
one
much
that
she
has
said
still
seems
untried
and
unexpected
writers
so
opposite
as
ibsen
and
anatole
france
have
expanded
her
themes
she
is
quoted
unconsciously
by
hundreds
who
are
ignorant
of
their
real
source
of
inspiration
no
woman
ever
wrote
with
such
force
before
and
no

even
approached

her
father
in
of
her
childhood
george
sand
has
given
a
most
picturesque
account
in
her
histoire
de
ma
in
the
girl
was
sent
to
the
convent
of
the
english
augustinians
in
paris
where
she
passed
through
a
state
of
religious
mysticism
she
returned
to
nohant
in
and
soon
threw
off
her
pietism
in
the
outdoor
exercises
of
a
wholesome
country
life
within
a
few
months
mme
dupin
de
francueil
died
at
a
great
age
and
aurore
was
tempted
to
return
to
paris
her
relatives
however
were
anxious
that
she
should
not
do
this
and
they
introduced
to
her
the
natural
son
of
a
retired
colonel
the
baron
dudevant
whom
in
september
she
married
she
brought
him
to
live
with
her
at
nohant
and
she
bore
him
two
sons
maurice
and
solange
and
a
daughter
she
quickly
perceived
as
her
own
intellectual
nature
developed
that
her
boorish
husband
was
unsuited
to
her
but
their
early
years
of
married
life
were
not
absolutely
intolerable
in
however
she
could
endure
him
no
longer
and
an
amicable
separation
was
agreed
upon
she
left
dudevant
at
nohant
resigning
her
fortune
and
proceeded
to
paris
where
she
was
hard
pressed
to
find
a
living
she
endeavoured
without
success
to
paint
the
lids
of
and
in
final
desperation
under
the
influence
of
jules
sandeau
who
became
her
lover
and
who
invented
the
pseudonym
of
george
sand
for
her
she
turned
her
attention
to
literature
her
earliest
work
was
to
help
sandeau
in
the
composition
of
his
novel
rose
et
blanche
her
first
independent
novel
indiana
appeared
at
the
close
of
and
her
second
valentine
two
months
later
these
books
produced
a
great
and
immediate
sensation
and
she
felt
that
she
had
found
her
vocation
in
she
produced
lebia
in
the
lettres
d
un
voyageur
and
jacques
in
andre
and
leone
after
this
her
works
become
too
numerous
and
were
produced
with
too
monotonous
a
regularity
to
be
chronicled
here
but
it
should
be
said
that
mauprat
was
written
in
at
nohant
while
she
was
pleading
for
a
legal
separation
from
her
husband
which
was
given
her
by
the
tribunal
of
bourges
with
full
authority
over
the
education
of
her
children
these
early
novels
all
reflect
in
measure
the
personal
sorrows
of
the
author
although
george
sand
never
ceased
to
protest
against
too
strict
a
biographical
interpretation
of
their
incidents
spiridion
composed
under
the
influence
of
lamennais
deals
with
questions
of
free
thought
in
religion
but
the
novels
of
the
first
period
of
her
literary
activity
which
came
to
a
close
in
are
mainly
occupied
with
a
lyrical
individualism
and
are
inspired
by
the
wrongs
and
disillusions
of
the
author
s
personal
adventures
the
years
and
were
marked
by
her
relations
with
alfred
de
musset
with
whom
she
lived
in
paris
and
at
venice
and
with
whom
she
quarrelled
at
last
in
circumstances
deplorably
infelicitous
neither
of
these
great
creatures
had
the
reticence
to
exclude
the
world
from
a
narrative
of
their
misfortunes
and
adventures
of
the
two
it
was
fairly
certainly
the
woman
who
came
the
less
injured
out
of
the
furnace
in
elle
et
lui
she
gave
long
afterward
her
version
of
the
unhappy
and
undignified
story
her
stay
in
venice
appears
to
have
impressed
her
genius
more
deeply
than
any
other
section
of
her
numerous
foreign
sojournings
the
writings
of
george
sand
s
second
period
which
extended
from
to
are
of
a
more
general
character
and
are
tinged
with
a
generous
but
not
very
enlightened
ardour
for
social
emancipation
of
these
novels
the
earliest
is
le
compagnon
du
tour
de
france
which
is
scarcely
a
masterpiece
in
the
pursuit
of
foreign
modes
of
thought
and
impelled
by
experiences
of
travel
george
sand
rose
to
far
greater
heights
in
jeanne
in
consuelo
and
in
la
comtesse
de
rudolstade
all
these
books
were
composed
in
her
retirement
at
nohant
where
she
definitely
settled
in
after
having
travelled
for
several
months
in
switzerland
with
liszt
and
mme
d
agoult
and
having
lived
in
the
island
of
majorca
for
some
time
with
the
dying
chopin
an
episode
which
is
enshrined
in
her
lucrezia
floriani
the
revolution
of
appeared
to
george
sand
a
realization
of
her
utopian
dreams
and
plunged
her
thoughts
into
a
painful
disorder
she
soon
however
became
dissatisfied
with
the
result
of
her
republican
theories
and
she
turned
to
two
new
sources
of
success
the
country
story
and
the
stage
her
delicious
romance
of
francois
le
champi
attracted
a
new
and
enthusiastic
audience
to
her
and
her
entire
emancipation
from
problems
was
marked
in
the
pages
of
la
petite
fadette
and
of
la
mare
au
to
the
same
period
belong
les
visions
de
la
nuit
des
les
campagnes
les
maitres
sonneurs
and
from
to
she
gave
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
theatre
and
of
her
numerous
pieces
several
enjoyed
a
wide
and
considerable
success
although
it
can
not
be
said
that
any
of
her
plays
have
possessed
the
vitality
of
her
best
novels
the
most
solid
of
the
former
was
her
dramatization
of
her
story
le
marquis
de
villemer
which
was
one
of
the
latest
and
next
to
it
le
mariage
de
victorine
which
was
one
of
the
earliest
her
successes
on
the
stage
such
as
they
are
appear
mainly
due
to
collaboration
with
others
in
her
latest
period
from
to
george
sand
returned
to
her
first
lyrical
manner
although
with
more
reticence
and
a
wider
experience
of
life
of
the
very
abundant
fruitage
of
these
last
years
not
many
rank
with
the
masterpieces
of
her
earlier
periods
although
such
novels
as
tamaris
la
confession
d
une
jeune
fille
and
cadio
seemed
to
her
admirers
to
show
no
decline
of
force
or
fire
still
finer
perhaps
were
le
marquis
de
villemer
and
jean
de
la
roche
her
latest
production
which
appeared
after
her
death
was
the
contes
d
une
grand
mere
a
collection
full
of
humanity
and
beauty
george
sand
died
at
nohant
on
the
of
june
she
had
great
qualities
of
soul
and
in
spite
of
the
naive
irregularities
of
her
conduct
in
early
middle
life
she
can
not
be
regarded
otherwise
than
as
an
excellent
woman
she
was
brave
courageous
heroically
industrious
a
loyal
friend
a
tender
and
wise
mother
her
principle
fault
has
been
wittily
defined
by
henry
james
who
has
remarked
that
in
affairs
of
the
heart
george
sand
never
behaved
like
a
preface
when
i
wrote
my
novel
at
nohant
in
if
i
remember
rightly
i
had
just
been
suing
for
a
separation
hitherto
i
had
written
much
against
the
abuses
of
marriage
and
perhaps
though
insufficiently
explaining
my
views
had
induced
a
belief
that
i
failed
to
appreciate
its
essence
but
it
was
at
this
time
that
marriage
itself
stood
before
me
in
all
the
moral
beauty
of
its
principle
misfortune
is
not
without
its
uses
to
the
thoughtful
mind
the
more
clearly
i
had
realized
the
pain
and
pity
of
having
to
break
a
sacred
bond
the
more
profoundly
i
felt
that
where
marriage
is
wanting
is
in
certain
elements
of
happiness
and
justice
of
too
lofty
a
nature
to
appeal
to
our
actual
society
nay
more
society
strives
to
take
from
the
sanctity
of
the
institution
by
treating
it
as
a
contract
of
material
interests
attacking
it
on
all
sides
at
once
by
the
spirit
of
its
manners
by
its
prejudices
by
its
hypocritical
incredulity
while
writing
a
novel
as
an
occupation
and
distraction
for
my
mind
i
conceived
the
idea
of
portraying
an
exclusive
and
undying
love
before
during
and
after
marriage
thus
i
drew
the
hero
of
my
book
proclaiming
at
the
age
of
eighty
his
fidelity
to
the
one
woman
he
had
ever
loved
the
ideal
of
love
is
assuredly
eternal
fidelity
moral
and
religious
laws
have
aimed
at
consecrating
this
ideal
material
facts
obscure
it
civil
laws
are
so
framed
as
to
make
it
impossible
or
illusory
here
however
is
not
the
place
to
prove
this
nor
has
been
burdened
with
a
proof
of
the
theory
only
the
sentiment
by
which
i
was
specially
penetrated
at
the
time
of
writing
it
is
embodied
in
the
words
of
towards
the
end
of
the
book
she
was
the
only
woman
i
loved
in
all
my
life
none
other
ever
won
a
glance
from
me
or
knew
the
pressure
of
my
george
sand
june
to
gustave
papet
though
fashion
may
proscribe
the
patriarchal
fashion
of
dedications
i
would
ask
you
brother
and
friend
to
accept
this
of
a
tale
which
is
not
new
to
you
i
have
drawn
my
materials
in
part
from
the
cottages
of
our
noire
valley
may
we
live
and
die
there
repeating
every
evening
our
beloved
invocation
sancta
simplicitas
george
sand
mauprat
on
the
borders
of
la
marche
and
berry
in
the
district
known
as
varenne
which
is
naught
but
a
vast
moor
studded
with
forests
of
oak
and
chestnut
and
in
the
most
thickly
wooded
and
wildest
part
of
the
country
may
be
found
crouching
within
a
ravine
a
little
ruined
chateau
the
dilapidated
turrets
would
not
catch
your
eye
until
you
were
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
principal
portcullis
the
venerable
trees
around
and
the
scattered
rocks
above
bury
it
in
everlasting
obscurity
and
you
would
experience
the
greatest
difficulty
even
in
broad
daylight
in
crossing
the
deserted
path
leading
to
it
without
stumbling
against
the
gnarled
trunks
and
rubbish
that
bar
every
step
the
name
given
to
this
dark
ravine
and
gloomy
castle
is
it
was
not
so
long
ago
that
the
last
of
the
mauprats
the
heir
to
this
property
had
the
roofing
taken
away
and
all
the
woodwork
sold
then
as
if
to
give
a
kick
to
the
memory
of
his
ancestors
he
ordered
the
entrance
gate
to
be
thrown
down
the
north
tower
to
be
gutted
and
a
breach
to
be
made
in
the
surrounding
wall
this
done
he
departed
with
his
workmen
shaking
the
dust
from
off
his
feet
and
abandoning
his
domain
to
foxes
and
cormorants
and
vipers
since
then
whenever
the
and
from
the
huts
in
the
neighbourhood
pass
along
the
top
of
the
ravine
if
it
is
in
daytime
they
whistle
with
a
defiant
air
or
hurl
a
hearty
curse
at
the
ruins
but
when
day
falls
and
the
begins
to
screech
from
the
top
of
the
loopholes
and
pass
by
silently
with
quickened
step
and
cross
themselves
from
time
to
time
to
ward
off
the
evil
spirits
that
hold
sway
among
the
ruins
for
myself
i
own
that
i
have
never
skirted
the
ravine
at
night
without
feeling
a
certain
uneasiness
and
i
would
not
like
to
swear
that
on
some
stormy
nights
i
have
not
given
my
horse
a
touch
of
the
spur
in
order
to
escape
the
more
quickly
from
the
disagreeable
impression
this
neighbourhood
made
on
me
the
reason
is
that
in
childhood
i
classed
the
name
of
mauprat
with
those
of
cartouche
and
bluebeard
and
in
the
course
of
horrible
dreams
i
often
used
to
mix
up
the
ancient
legends
of
the
ogre
and
the
bogey
with
the
quite
recent
events
which
in
our
province
had
given
such
a
sinister
lustre
to
this
mauprat
family
frequently
out
shooting
when
my
companions
and
i
have
left
our
posts
to
go
and
warm
ourselves
at
the
charcoal
fires
which
the
workmen
keep
up
all
night
i
have
heard
this
name
dying
away
on
their
lips
at
our
approach
but
when
they
had
recognised
us
and
thoroughly
satisfied
themselves
that
the
ghosts
of
none
of
these
robbers
were
hiding
in
our
midst
they
would
tell
us
in
a
whisper
such
stories
as
might
make
one
s
hair
stand
on
end
stories
which
i
shall
take
good
care
not
to
pass
on
to
you
grieved
as
i
am
that
they
should
ever
have
darkened
and
pained
my
own
memory
not
that
the
story
i
am
about
to
tell
is
altogether
pleasant
and
cheerful
on
the
contrary
i
must
ask
your
pardon
for
unfolding
so
sombre
a
tale
yet
in
the
impression
which
it
has
made
on
myself
there
is
something
so
consoling
and
if
i
may
venture
the
phrase
so
healthful
to
the
soul
that
you
will
excuse
me
i
hope
for
the
sake
of
the
result
besides
this
is
a
story
which
has
just
been
told
to
me
and
now
you
ask
me
for
one
the
opportunity
is
too
good
to
be
missed
for
one
of
my
laziness
or
lack
of
invention
it
was
only
last
week
that
i
met
bernard
mauprat
the
last
of
the
line
the
man
who
having
long
before
severed
himself
from
his
infamous
connections
determined
to
demolish
his
manor
as
a
sign
of
the
horror
aroused
in
him
by
the
recollections
of
childhood
this
bernard
is
one
of
the
most
respected
men
in
the
province
he
lives
in
a
pretty
house
near
chateauroux
in
a
flat
country
finding
myself
in
the
neighbourhood
with
a
friend
of
mine
who
knows
him
i
expressed
a
wish
to
be
introduced
and
my
friend
promising
me
a
hearty
welcome
took
me
to
his
house
then
and
there
i
already
knew
in
outline
the
remarkable
history
of
this
old
man
but
i
had
always
felt
a
keen
desire
to
fill
in
the
details
and
above
all
to
receive
them
from
himself
for
me
the
strange
destiny
of
the
man
was
a
philosophical
problem
to
be
solved
i
therefore
noticed
his
features
his
manners
and
his
home
with
peculiar
interest
bernard
mauprat
must
be
fully
though
his
robust
health
his
upright
figure
his
firm
step
and
the
absence
of
any
infirmity
might
indicate
some
fifteen
or
twenty
years
less
his
face
would
have
appeared
to
me
extremely
handsome
had
not
a
certain
harshness
of
expression
brought
before
my
eyes
in
spite
of
myself
the
shades
of
his
fathers
i
very
much
fear
that
externally
at
all
events
he
must
resemble
them
this
he
alone
could
have
told
us
for
neither
my
friend
nor
myself
had
known
any
other
mauprat
naturally
however
we
were
very
careful
not
to
inquire
it
struck
us
that
his
servants
waited
on
him
with
a
promptitude
and
punctuality
quite
marvellous
in
berrichon
domestics
nevertheless
at
the
least
semblance
of
delay
he
raised
his
voice
knitted
his
eyebrows
which
still
showed
very
black
under
his
white
hair
and
muttered
a
few
expressions
of
impatience
which
lent
wings
even
to
the
slowest
at
first
i
was
somewhat
shocked
at
this
habit
it
appeared
to
savour
rather
too
strongly
of
the
mauprats
but
the
kindly
and
almost
paternal
manner
in
which
he
spoke
to
them
a
moment
later
and
their
zeal
which
seemed
so
distinct
from
fear
soon
reconciled
me
to
him
towards
us
moreover
he
showed
an
exquisite
politeness
and
expressed
himself
in
the
choicest
terms
unfortunately
at
the
end
of
dinner
a
door
which
had
been
left
open
and
through
which
a
cold
air
found
its
way
to
his
venerable
skull
drew
from
him
such
a
frightful
oath
that
my
friend
and
i
exchanged
a
look
of
surprise
he
noticed
it
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
he
said
i
am
afraid
you
find
me
an
odd
mixture
ah
you
see
but
a
short
distance
i
am
an
old
branch
happily
torn
from
a
vile
trunk
and
transplanted
into
good
soil
but
still
knotted
and
rough
like
the
wild
holly
of
the
original
stock
i
have
believe
me
had
no
little
trouble
in
reaching
the
state
of
comparative
gentleness
and
calm
in
which
you
behold
me
alas
if
i
dared
i
should
reproach
providence
with
a
great
injustice
that
of
having
allotted
me
a
life
as
short
as
other
men
s
when
one
has
to
struggle
for
forty
or
fifty
years
to
transform
one
s
self
from
a
wolf
into
a
man
one
ought
to
live
a
hundred
years
longer
to
enjoy
one
s
victory
yet
what
good
would
that
do
me
he
added
in
a
tone
of
sadness
the
kind
fairy
who
transformed
me
is
here
no
more
to
take
pleasure
in
her
work
bah
it
is
quite
time
to
have
done
with
it
then
he
turned
towards
me
and
looking
at
me
with
big
dark
eyes
still
strangely
animated
said
come
my
dear
young
man
i
know
what
brings
you
to
see
me
you
are
curious
to
hear
my
history
draw
nearer
the
fire
then
mauprat
though
i
am
i
will
not
make
you
do
duty
for
a
log
in
listening
you
are
giving
me
the
greatest
pleasure
you
could
give
your
friend
will
tell
you
however
that
i
do
not
willingly
talk
of
myself
i
am
generally
afraid
of
having
to
deal
with
blockheads
but
you
i
have
already
heard
of
i
know
your
character
and
your
profession
you
are
an
observer
and
narrator
in
other
words
pardon
me
inquisitive
and
a
he
began
to
laugh
and
i
made
an
effort
to
laugh
too
though
with
a
rising
suspicion
that
he
was
making
game
of
us
nor
could
i
help
thinking
of
the
nasty
tricks
that
his
grandfather
took
a
delight
in
playing
on
the
imprudent
busybodies
who
called
upon
him
but
he
put
his
arm
through
mine
in
a
friendly
way
and
making
me
sit
down
in
front
of
a
good
fire
near
a
table
covered
with
cups
don
t
be
annoyed
he
said
at
my
age
i
can
not
get
rid
of
hereditary
sarcasm
but
there
is
nothing
spiteful
in
mine
to
speak
seriously
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
and
to
confide
in
you
the
story
of
my
life
a
man
as
unfortunate
as
i
have
been
deserves
to
find
a
faithful
biographer
to
clear
his
memory
from
all
stain
listen
then
and
take
some
i
offered
him
a
cup
in
silence
he
refused
it
with
a
wave
of
the
arm
and
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say
that
is
rather
for
your
effeminate
then
he
began
his
narrative
in
these
words
i
you
live
not
very
far
from
and
must
have
often
passed
by
the
ruins
thus
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
describe
them
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
the
place
has
never
been
so
attractive
as
it
is
now
on
the
day
that
i
had
the
roof
taken
off
the
sun
for
the
first
time
brightened
the
damp
walls
within
which
my
childhood
was
passed
and
the
lizards
to
which
i
have
left
them
are
much
better
housed
there
than
i
once
was
they
can
at
least
behold
the
light
of
day
and
warm
their
cold
limbs
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
at
noon
there
used
to
be
an
elder
and
a
younger
branch
of
the
mauprats
i
belong
to
the
elder
my
grandfather
was
that
old
tristan
de
mauprat
who
ran
through
his
fortune
dishonoured
his
name
and
was
such
a
blackguard
that
his
memory
is
already
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
the
marvelous
the
peasants
still
believe
that
his
ghost
appears
either
in
the
body
of
a
wizard
who
shows
malefactors
the
way
to
the
dwellings
of
varenne
or
in
that
of
an
old
white
hare
which
reveals
itself
to
people
meditating
some
evil
deed
when
i
came
into
the
world
the
only
living
member
of
the
younger
branch
was
monsieur
hubert
de
mauprat
known
as
the
chevalier
because
he
belonged
to
the
order
of
the
knights
of
malta
a
man
just
as
good
as
his
cousin
was
bad
being
the
youngest
son
of
his
family
he
had
taken
the
vow
of
celibacy
but
when
he
found
himself
the
sole
survivor
of
several
brothers
and
sisters
he
obtained
release
from
his
vow
and
took
a
wife
the
year
before
i
was
born
rumour
says
that
before
changing
his
existence
in
this
way
he
made
strenuous
efforts
to
find
some
descendant
of
the
elder
branch
worthy
to
restore
the
tarnished
family
name
and
preserve
the
fortune
which
had
accumulated
in
the
hands
of
the
younger
branch
he
had
endeavoured
to
put
his
cousin
tristan
s
affairs
in
order
and
had
frequently
paid
off
the
latter
s
creditors
seeing
however
that
the
only
effect
of
his
kindness
was
to
encourage
the
vices
of
the
family
and
that
instead
of
respect
and
gratitude
he
received
nothing
but
secret
hatred
and
churlish
jealousy
he
abandoned
all
attempts
at
friendship
broke
with
his
cousins
and
in
spite
of
his
advanced
age
he
was
over
sixty
took
a
wife
in
order
to
have
heirs
of
his
own
he
had
one
daughter
and
there
his
hopes
of
posterity
ended
for
soon
afterward
his
wife
died
of
a
violent
illness
which
the
doctors
called
iliac
passion
he
then
left
that
part
of
the
country
and
returned
but
rarely
to
his
estates
these
were
situated
about
six
leagues
from
on
the
borders
of
the
varenne
du
fromental
he
was
a
prudent
man
and
a
just
because
he
was
cultured
because
his
father
had
moved
with
the
spirit
of
his
century
and
had
had
him
educated
none
the
less
he
had
preserved
a
firm
character
and
an
enterprising
mind
and
like
his
ancestors
he
was
proud
of
hearing
as
a
sort
of
surname
the
knightly
title
of
headbreaker
hereditary
in
the
original
mauprat
stock
as
for
the
elder
branch
it
had
turned
out
so
badly
or
rather
had
preserved
from
the
old
feudal
days
such
terrible
habits
of
brigandage
that
it
had
won
for
itself
the
distinctive
title
of
hamstringer
i
hazard
headbreaker
and
hamstringer
as
poor
equivalents
for
the
and
of
the
tr
of
the
sons
of
tristan
my
father
the
eldest
was
the
only
one
who
married
i
was
his
only
child
here
it
is
necessary
to
mention
a
fact
of
which
i
was
long
ignorant
hubert
de
mauprat
on
hearing
of
my
birth
begged
me
of
my
parents
undertaking
to
make
me
his
heir
if
he
were
allowed
absolute
control
over
my
education
at
a
about
this
time
my
father
was
killed
by
an
accidental
shot
and
my
grandfather
refused
the
chevalier
s
offer
declaring
that
his
children
were
the
sole
legitimate
heirs
of
the
younger
branch
and
that
consequently
he
would
resist
with
all
his
might
any
substitution
in
my
favour
it
was
then
that
hubert
s
daughter
was
born
but
when
seven
years
later
his
wife
died
leaving
him
this
one
child
the
desire
so
strong
in
the
nobles
of
that
time
to
perpetuate
their
name
urged
him
to
renew
his
request
to
my
mother
what
her
answer
was
i
do
not
know
she
fell
ill
and
died
the
country
doctors
again
brought
in
a
verdict
of
iliac
passion
my
grandfather
had
spent
the
last
two
days
she
passed
in
this
world
with
her
pour
me
out
a
glass
of
spanish
wine
for
i
feel
a
cold
shiver
running
through
my
body
it
is
nothing
serious
merely
the
effect
that
these
early
recollections
have
on
me
when
i
begin
to
narrate
them
it
will
soon
pass
off
he
swallowed
a
large
glass
of
wine
and
we
did
the
same
for
a
sensation
of
cold
came
upon
us
too
as
we
gazed
at
his
stern
face
and
listened
to
his
brief
abrupt
sentences
he
continued
thus
at
the
age
of
seven
i
found
myself
an
orphan
my
grandfather
searched
my
mother
s
house
and
seized
all
the
money
and
valuables
he
could
carry
away
then
leaving
the
rest
and
declaring
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
lawyers
he
did
not
even
wait
for
the
funeral
but
took
me
by
the
collar
and
flung
me
on
to
the
crupper
of
his
horse
saying
now
my
young
ward
come
home
with
me
and
try
to
stop
that
crying
soon
for
i
haven
t
much
patience
with
in
fact
after
a
few
seconds
he
gave
me
such
hard
cuts
with
his
whip
that
i
stopped
crying
and
withdrawing
myself
like
a
tortoise
into
my
shell
completed
the
journey
without
daring
to
breathe
he
was
a
tall
old
man
bony
and
i
fancy
i
see
him
now
as
he
was
then
the
impression
that
evening
made
on
me
can
never
be
effaced
it
was
a
sudden
realization
of
all
the
horrors
which
my
mother
had
foreshadowed
when
speaking
of
her
execrable
and
his
brigands
of
sons
the
moon
i
remember
was
shining
here
and
there
through
the
dense
foliage
of
the
forest
my
grandfather
s
horse
was
lean
hardy
and
like
himself
it
kicked
at
every
cut
of
the
whip
and
its
master
gave
it
plenty
swift
as
an
arrow
it
jumped
the
ravines
and
little
torrents
which
everywhere
intersect
varenne
in
all
directions
at
each
jump
i
lost
my
balance
and
clung
in
terror
to
the
saddle
or
my
grandfather
s
coat
as
for
him
he
was
so
little
concerned
about
me
that
had
i
fallen
i
doubt
whether
he
would
have
taken
the
trouble
to
pick
me
up
sometimes
noticing
my
terror
he
would
jeer
at
me
and
to
make
me
still
more
afraid
set
his
horse
plunging
again
twenty
times
in
a
frenzy
of
despair
i
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
myself
off
but
the
instinctive
love
of
life
prevented
me
from
giving
way
to
the
impulse
at
last
about
midnight
we
suddenly
stopped
before
a
small
pointed
gate
and
the
drawbridge
was
soon
lifted
behind
us
my
grandfather
took
me
bathed
in
a
cold
sweat
as
i
was
and
threw
me
over
to
a
great
fellow
lame
and
horribly
ugly
who
carried
me
into
the
house
this
was
my
uncle
john
and
i
was
at
at
that
time
my
grandfather
along
with
his
eight
sons
formed
the
last
relic
in
our
province
of
that
race
of
petty
feudal
tyrants
by
which
france
had
been
overrun
and
harassed
for
so
many
centuries
civilization
already
advancing
rapidly
towards
the
great
convulsion
of
the
revolution
was
gradually
stamping
out
the
systematic
extortions
of
these
robbers
the
light
of
education
a
species
of
good
taste
reflected
however
dimly
from
a
polished
court
and
perhaps
a
presentiment
of
the
impending
terrible
awakening
of
the
people
were
spreading
through
the
castles
and
even
through
the
manors
of
the
lordlings
ever
in
our
midland
provinces
the
most
backward
by
reason
of
their
situation
the
sentiment
of
social
equality
was
already
driving
out
the
customs
of
a
barbarous
age
more
than
one
vile
scapegrace
had
been
forced
to
reform
in
spite
of
his
privileges
and
in
certain
places
where
the
peasants
driven
to
desperation
had
rid
themselves
of
their
overlord
the
law
had
not
dreamt
of
interfering
nor
had
the
relatives
dared
to
demand
redress
in
spite
of
the
prevailing
tone
of
mind
my
grandfather
had
long
maintained
his
position
in
the
country
without
experiencing
any
opposition
but
having
had
a
large
family
endowed
like
himself
with
a
goodly
number
of
vices
he
finally
found
himself
pestered
and
besieged
by
creditors
who
instead
of
being
frightened
by
his
threats
as
of
old
were
themselves
threatening
to
make
him
suffer
he
was
obliged
to
devise
some
means
of
avoiding
the
bailiffs
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
the
fights
which
were
continually
taking
place
in
these
fights
the
mauprats
no
longer
shone
despite
their
numbers
their
complete
union
and
their
herculean
strength
since
the
whole
population
of
the
district
sided
with
their
opponents
and
took
upon
itself
the
duty
of
stoning
them
so
rallying
his
progeny
around
him
as
the
wild
boar
gathers
together
its
young
after
a
hunt
tristan
withdrew
into
his
castle
and
ordered
the
drawbridge
to
be
raised
shut
up
with
him
were
ten
or
twelve
peasants
his
servants
all
of
them
poachers
or
refugees
who
like
himself
had
some
interest
in
retiring
from
the
world
his
own
expression
and
in
finding
a
place
of
safety
behind
good
stout
walls
an
enormous
pile
of
hunting
weapons
carbines
blunderbusses
spears
and
cutlasses
were
raised
on
the
platform
and
the
porter
received
orders
never
to
let
more
than
two
persons
at
a
time
approach
within
range
of
his
gun
from
that
day
mauprat
and
his
sons
broke
with
all
civil
laws
as
they
had
already
broken
with
all
moral
laws
they
formed
themselves
into
a
band
of
adventurers
while
their
and
trusty
poachers
supplied
the
house
with
game
they
levied
illegal
taxes
on
the
small
farms
in
the
neighbourhood
now
without
being
cowards
and
they
are
far
from
that
the
peasants
of
our
province
as
you
know
are
meek
and
timid
partly
from
listlessness
partly
from
distrust
of
the
law
which
they
have
never
understood
and
of
which
even
to
this
day
they
have
but
a
scanty
knowledge
no
province
of
france
has
preserved
more
old
traditions
or
longer
endured
the
abuses
of
feudalism
nowhere
else
perhaps
has
the
title
of
the
lord
of
the
manor
been
handed
down
as
hitherto
with
us
to
the
owners
of
certain
estates
and
nowhere
is
it
so
easy
to
frighten
the
people
with
reports
of
some
absurd
and
impossible
political
event
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
the
mauprats
being
the
only
powerful
family
in
a
district
remote
from
towns
and
cut
off
from
communication
with
the
outside
world
had
little
difficulty
in
persuading
their
vassals
that
serfdom
was
about
to
be
and
that
it
would
go
hard
with
all
who
resisted
the
peasants
hesitated
listened
timorously
to
the
few
among
themselves
who
preached
independence
then
thought
the
matter
over
and
decided
to
submit
the
mauprats
were
clever
enough
not
to
demand
money
of
them
for
money
is
what
the
peasant
in
such
a
district
obtains
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
parts
from
with
the
greatest
reluctance
money
is
dear
is
one
of
his
proverbs
because
in
his
eyes
money
stands
for
something
different
from
manual
labour
it
means
traffic
with
men
and
things
outside
his
world
an
effort
of
foresight
or
circumspection
a
bargain
a
sort
of
intellectual
struggle
which
lifts
him
out
of
his
ordinary
heedless
habits
it
means
in
a
word
mental
labour
and
this
for
him
is
the
most
painful
and
the
most
wearing
the
mauprats
knowing
how
the
ground
lay
and
having
no
particular
need
of
money
any
longer
since
they
had
repudiated
their
debts
demanded
payments
in
kind
only
they
ruled
that
one
man
should
contribute
capons
another
calves
a
third
corn
a
fourth
fodder
and
so
on
they
were
careful
too
to
tax
judiciously
to
demand
from
each
the
commodity
he
could
provide
with
least
inconvenience
to
himself
in
return
they
promised
help
and
protection
to
all
and
up
to
a
certain
point
they
kept
their
word
they
cleared
the
land
of
wolves
and
foxes
gave
a
welcome
and
a
to
all
deserters
and
helped
to
defraud
the
state
by
intimidating
the
excise
officers
and
they
took
advantage
of
their
power
to
give
the
poor
man
a
false
notion
of
his
real
interests
and
to
corrupt
the
simple
folk
by
undermining
all
sense
of
their
dignity
and
natural
liberty
they
made
the
whole
district
combine
in
a
sort
of
secession
from
the
law
and
they
so
frightened
the
functionaries
appointed
to
enforce
respect
for
it
that
after
a
few
years
it
fell
into
a
veritable
desuetude
thus
it
happened
that
while
france
at
a
short
distance
from
this
region
was
advancing
with
rapid
strides
towards
the
enfranchisement
of
the
poorer
classes
varenne
was
executing
a
retrograde
march
and
returning
at
full
speed
to
the
ancient
tyranny
of
the
country
squires
it
was
easy
enough
for
the
mauprats
to
pervert
these
poor
folk
they
feigned
a
friendly
interest
in
them
to
mark
their
difference
from
the
other
nobles
in
the
province
whose
manners
still
retained
some
of
the
haughtiness
of
their
ancient
power
above
all
my
grandfather
lost
no
opportunity
of
making
the
peasants
share
his
own
hatred
of
his
own
cousin
hubert
de
mauprat
the
latter
whenever
he
interviewed
his
vassals
would
remain
seated
in
his
while
they
stood
before
him
bareheaded
whereas
tristan
de
mauprat
would
make
them
sit
down
at
his
table
and
drink
some
of
the
wine
they
had
brought
him
as
a
sign
of
voluntary
homage
he
would
then
have
them
led
home
by
his
men
in
the
middle
of
the
night
all
dead
drunk
torches
in
hand
and
making
the
forest
resound
with
ribald
songs
libertinism
completed
the
demoralization
of
the
peasantry
in
every
family
the
mauprats
soon
had
their
mistresses
this
was
tolerated
partly
because
it
was
profitable
and
partly
alas
that
it
should
have
to
be
said
because
it
gratified
vanity
the
very
isolation
of
the
houses
was
favourable
to
the
evil
no
scandal
no
denunciation
were
to
be
feared
the
tiniest
village
would
have
been
sufficient
for
the
creation
and
maintenance
of
a
public
opinion
there
however
there
were
only
scattered
cottages
and
isolated
farms
wastes
and
woods
so
separated
the
families
from
one
another
that
the
exercise
of
any
mutual
control
was
impossible
shame
is
stronger
than
conscience
i
need
not
tell
you
of
all
the
bonds
of
infamy
that
united
masters
and
slaves
debauchery
extortion
and
fraud
were
both
precept
and
example
for
my
youth
and
life
went
on
merrily
all
notions
of
justice
were
scoffed
at
creditors
were
defrauded
of
both
interest
and
capital
any
law
officer
who
ventured
to
serve
a
summons
received
a
sound
thrashing
and
the
mounted
police
were
fired
on
if
they
approached
too
near
the
turrets
a
plague
on
parliament
starvation
to
all
imbued
with
the
new
philosophy
and
death
to
the
younger
branch
of
the
mauprats
such
were
the
watchwords
of
these
men
who
to
crown
all
gave
themselves
the
airs
of
of
the
twelfth
century
my
grandfather
talked
of
nothing
but
his
pedigree
and
the
prowess
of
his
ancestors
he
regretted
the
good
old
days
when
every
lordling
had
instruments
of
torture
in
his
manor
and
dungeons
and
best
of
all
cannon
in
ours
we
only
had
pitchforks
and
sticks
and
a
culverin
which
my
uncle
john
used
to
point
and
point
very
well
in
fact
and
which
was
sufficient
to
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
the
military
force
of
the
district
ii
old
mauprat
was
a
treacherous
animal
of
the
carnivorous
order
a
cross
between
a
lynx
and
a
fox
along
with
a
copious
and
easy
flow
of
language
he
had
a
veneer
of
education
which
helped
his
cunning
he
made
a
point
of
excessive
politeness
and
had
great
powers
of
persuasion
even
with
the
objects
of
his
vengeance
he
knew
how
to
entice
them
to
his
castle
where
he
would
make
them
undergo
frightful
for
which
however
having
no
witnesses
they
were
unable
to
obtain
redress
by
law
all
his
villainies
bore
the
stamp
of
such
consummate
skill
that
the
country
came
to
view
them
with
a
sort
of
awe
akin
to
respect
no
one
could
ever
catch
him
out
of
his
den
though
he
issued
forth
often
enough
and
apparently
without
taking
many
precautions
in
truth
he
was
a
man
with
a
genius
for
evil
and
his
sons
bound
to
him
by
no
ties
of
affection
of
which
indeed
they
were
incapable
yet
acknowledged
the
sway
of
this
superior
evil
genius
and
gave
him
a
uniform
and
ready
obedience
in
which
there
was
something
almost
fanatic
he
was
their
deliverer
in
all
desperate
cases
and
when
the
weariness
of
confinement
under
our
chilly
vaults
began
to
fill
them
with
his
mind
brutal
even
in
jest
would
cure
them
by
arranging
for
their
pleasure
shows
worthy
of
a
den
of
thieves
sometimes
poor
mendicant
monks
collecting
alms
would
be
terrified
or
tortured
for
their
benefit
their
beards
would
be
burned
off
or
they
would
be
lowered
into
a
well
and
kept
hanging
between
life
and
death
until
they
had
sung
some
foul
song
or
uttered
some
blasphemy
everybody
knows
the
story
of
the
notary
who
was
allowed
to
enter
in
company
with
his
four
clerks
and
whom
they
received
with
all
the
assiduity
of
pompous
hospitality
my
grandfather
pretended
to
agree
with
a
good
grace
to
the
execution
of
their
warrant
and
politely
helped
them
to
make
an
inventory
of
his
furniture
of
which
the
sale
had
been
decreed
after
this
when
dinner
was
served
and
the
king
s
men
had
taken
their
places
at
table
he
said
to
the
notary
ah
mon
dieu
i
was
forgetting
a
poor
hack
of
mine
in
the
stable
it
s
a
small
matter
still
you
might
be
reprimanded
for
omitting
it
and
as
i
see
that
you
are
a
worthy
fellow
i
should
be
sorry
to
mislead
you
come
with
me
and
see
it
it
won
t
take
us
a
the
notary
followed
mauprat
unsuspectingly
just
as
they
were
about
to
enter
the
stable
together
mauprat
who
was
leading
the
way
told
him
to
put
in
his
head
only
the
notary
anxious
to
show
great
consideration
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
and
not
to
pry
into
things
too
closely
did
as
he
was
told
then
mauprat
suddenly
pushed
the
door
to
and
squeezed
his
neck
so
violently
between
it
and
the
wall
that
the
wretched
man
could
not
breathe
deeming
him
sufficiently
punished
tristan
opened
the
door
again
and
asking
pardon
for
his
carelessness
with
great
civility
offered
the
man
his
arm
to
take
him
back
to
dinner
this
the
notary
did
not
consider
it
wise
to
refuse
but
as
soon
as
he
the
room
where
his
colleagues
were
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
pointing
to
his
livid
face
and
mangled
neck
demanded
justice
for
the
trap
into
which
he
had
just
been
led
it
was
then
that
my
grandfather
revelling
in
his
rascally
wit
went
through
a
comedy
scene
of
sublime
audacity
he
gravely
reproached
the
notary
with
accusing
him
unjustly
and
always
addressing
him
kindly
and
with
studied
politeness
called
the
others
to
bear
witness
to
his
conduct
begging
them
to
make
allowances
if
his
precarious
position
had
forced
him
to
give
them
such
a
poor
reception
all
the
while
doing
the
honours
of
the
table
in
splendid
style
the
poor
notary
did
not
dare
to
press
the
matter
and
was
compelled
to
dine
although
half
dead
his
companions
were
so
completely
duped
by
mauprat
s
assurance
that
they
ate
and
drank
merrily
treating
the
notary
as
a
lunatic
and
a
boor
they
left
all
drunk
singing
the
praises
of
their
host
and
laughing
at
the
notary
who
fell
down
dead
upon
the
threshold
of
his
house
on
dismounting
from
his
horse
the
eight
sons
the
pride
and
strength
of
old
mauprat
all
resembled
him
in
physical
vigour
brutality
of
manners
and
to
some
extent
in
craftiness
and
jesting
the
truth
is
they
were
veritable
brutes
capable
of
any
evil
and
completely
dead
to
any
noble
thought
or
generous
sentiment
nevertheless
they
were
endowed
with
a
sort
of
reckless
dashing
courage
which
now
and
then
seemed
to
have
in
it
an
element
of
grandeur
but
it
is
time
that
i
told
you
about
myself
and
gave
you
some
idea
of
the
development
of
my
character
in
the
thick
of
this
filthy
mire
into
which
it
had
pleased
god
to
plunge
me
on
leaving
my
cradle
i
should
be
wrong
if
in
order
to
gain
your
sympathy
in
these
early
years
of
my
life
i
asserted
that
i
was
born
with
a
noble
nature
a
pure
and
incorruptible
soul
as
to
this
i
know
nothing
maybe
there
are
no
incorruptible
souls
maybe
there
are
that
is
what
neither
you
nor
any
one
will
ever
know
the
great
questions
awaiting
an
answer
are
these
are
our
innate
tendencies
invincible
if
not
can
they
be
modified
merely
or
wholly
destroyed
by
education
for
myself
i
would
not
dare
to
affirm
i
am
neither
a
metaphysician
nor
a
psychologist
nor
a
philosopher
but
i
have
had
a
terrible
life
gentlemen
and
if
i
were
a
legislator
i
would
order
that
man
to
have
his
tongue
torn
out
or
his
head
cut
off
who
dared
to
preach
or
write
that
the
nature
of
individuals
is
unchangeable
and
that
it
is
no
more
possible
to
reform
the
character
of
a
man
than
the
appetite
of
a
tiger
god
has
preserved
me
from
believing
this
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
my
mother
instilled
into
me
good
principles
though
perhaps
i
was
not
endowed
by
nature
with
her
good
qualities
even
with
her
i
was
of
a
violent
disposition
but
my
violence
was
sullen
and
suppressed
i
was
blind
and
brutal
in
anger
nervous
even
to
cowardice
at
the
approach
of
danger
daring
almost
to
foolhardiness
when
hand
to
hand
with
it
that
is
to
say
at
once
timid
and
brave
from
my
love
of
life
my
obstinacy
was
revolting
yet
my
mother
alone
could
conquer
me
and
without
attempting
to
reason
for
my
mind
developed
very
slowly
i
used
to
obey
her
as
if
by
a
sort
of
magnetic
necessity
this
one
guiding
hand
which
i
remember
and
another
woman
s
which
i
felt
later
were
and
have
been
sufficient
to
lead
me
towards
good
but
i
lost
my
mother
before
she
had
been
able
to
teach
me
anything
seriously
and
when
i
was
transplanted
to
my
feeling
for
the
evil
done
there
was
merely
an
instinctive
aversion
feeble
enough
perhaps
if
fear
had
not
been
mingled
with
it
but
i
thank
heaven
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
for
the
cruelties
heaped
upon
me
there
and
above
all
for
the
hatred
which
my
uncle
john
conceived
for
me
my
preserved
me
from
indifference
in
the
presence
of
evil
and
my
sufferings
helped
me
to
detest
those
who
wrought
it
this
john
was
certainly
the
most
detestable
of
his
race
ever
since
a
fall
from
his
horse
had
maimed
him
his
evil
temper
had
developed
in
proportion
to
his
inability
to
do
as
much
harm
as
his
companions
compelled
to
remain
at
home
when
the
others
set
out
on
their
expeditions
for
he
could
not
bestride
a
horse
he
found
his
only
chance
of
pleasure
in
those
fruitless
little
attacks
which
the
mounted
police
sometimes
made
on
the
castle
as
if
to
ease
their
conscience
then
intrenched
behind
a
rampart
of
freestone
which
he
had
had
built
to
suit
himself
john
calmly
seated
near
his
culverin
would
pick
off
a
gentleman
from
time
to
time
and
at
once
regain
as
he
said
his
sleeping
and
eating
power
which
want
of
exercise
had
taken
from
him
and
he
would
even
climb
up
to
his
beloved
platform
without
waiting
for
the
excuse
of
an
attack
and
there
crouching
down
like
a
cat
ready
to
spring
as
soon
as
he
saw
any
one
appear
in
the
distance
without
giving
the
signal
he
would
try
his
skill
upon
the
target
and
make
the
man
retrace
his
steps
this
he
called
sweeping
the
path
clean
as
i
was
too
young
to
accompany
my
uncles
on
their
hunting
and
plundering
expeditions
john
naturally
became
my
guardian
and
tutor
that
is
to
say
my
jailor
and
tormentor
i
will
not
give
you
all
the
details
of
that
infernal
existence
for
nearly
ten
years
i
endured
cold
hunger
insults
the
dungeon
and
blows
according
to
the
more
or
less
savage
caprices
of
this
monster
his
fierce
hatred
of
me
arose
from
the
fact
that
he
could
not
succeed
in
depraving
me
my
rugged
headstrong
and
unsociable
nature
preserved
me
from
his
vile
seductions
it
is
possible
that
i
had
not
any
strong
tendencies
to
virtue
to
hatred
i
luckily
had
rather
than
do
the
bidding
of
my
tyrant
i
would
have
suffered
a
thousand
deaths
and
so
i
grew
up
without
conceiving
any
affection
for
vice
however
my
notions
about
society
were
so
strange
that
my
uncles
mode
of
life
did
not
in
itself
cause
me
any
repugnance
seeing
that
i
was
brought
up
behind
the
walls
of
and
that
i
lived
in
a
state
of
perpetual
siege
you
will
understand
that
i
had
precisely
such
ideas
as
any
armed
retainer
in
the
barbarous
ages
of
feudalism
might
have
had
what
outside
our
den
was
termed
by
other
men
assassinating
plundering
and
torturing
i
was
taught
to
call
fighting
conquering
and
subduing
my
sole
knowledge
of
history
consisted
of
an
acquaintance
with
certain
legends
and
ballads
of
chivalry
which
my
grandfather
used
to
repeat
to
me
of
an
evening
when
he
had
time
to
think
of
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
my
education
whenever
i
asked
him
any
question
about
the
present
time
he
used
to
answer
that
times
had
sadly
changed
that
all
frenchmen
had
become
traitors
and
felons
that
they
had
frightened
their
kings
and
that
these
like
cravens
had
deserted
the
nobles
who
in
their
turn
had
been
cowardly
enough
to
renounce
their
privileges
and
let
laws
be
made
for
them
by
clodhoppers
i
listened
with
surprise
almost
with
indignation
to
this
account
of
the
age
in
which
i
lived
for
me
an
age
of
shadows
and
mysteries
my
grandfather
had
but
vague
ideas
of
chronology
not
a
book
of
any
kind
was
to
be
found
at
except
i
should
say
the
history
of
the
sons
of
aymon
and
a
few
chronicles
of
the
same
class
brought
by
our
servants
from
country
fairs
three
names
and
only
three
stood
clear
in
the
chaos
of
my
ignorance
charlemagne
louis
xi
and
louis
xiv
because
my
grandfather
would
frequently
introduce
these
into
dissertations
on
the
unrecognised
rights
of
the
nobles
in
truth
i
was
so
ignorant
that
i
scarcely
knew
the
difference
between
a
reign
and
a
race
and
i
was
by
no
means
sure
that
my
grandfather
had
not
seen
charlemagne
for
he
spoke
of
him
more
frequently
and
more
gladly
than
of
any
other
man
but
while
my
native
energy
led
me
to
admire
the
exploits
of
my
uncles
and
filled
me
with
a
longing
to
share
in
them
the
cruelty
they
perpetrated
on
returning
from
their
expeditions
and
the
perfidious
artifices
by
which
they
lured
their
dupes
to
the
castle
in
order
to
torture
them
to
extort
ransom
roused
in
me
strange
and
painful
emotions
which
now
that
i
am
speaking
in
all
sincerity
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
account
for
exactly
in
the
absence
of
all
ordinary
moral
principles
it
might
have
been
natural
for
me
to
accept
the
theory
which
i
daily
saw
carried
into
practice
that
makes
it
right
but
the
humiliation
and
suffering
which
my
uncle
john
inflicted
on
me
in
virtue
of
this
theory
taught
me
to
be
dissatisfied
with
it
i
could
appreciate
the
right
of
the
bravest
and
i
genuinely
despised
those
who
with
death
in
their
power
yet
chose
life
at
the
price
of
such
ignominy
as
they
had
to
bear
at
but
i
could
only
explain
these
insults
and
horrors
heaped
on
prisoners
some
of
them
women
and
mere
children
as
manifestations
of
bloodthirsty
appetites
i
do
not
know
if
i
was
sufficiently
susceptible
of
a
noble
sentiment
to
be
inspired
with
pity
for
the
victim
but
certain
it
is
that
i
experienced
that
feeling
of
selfish
commiseration
which
is
common
to
all
natures
and
which
purified
and
ennobled
has
become
charity
among
civilized
peoples
under
my
coarse
exterior
my
heart
no
doubt
merely
felt
passing
shocks
of
fear
and
disgust
at
the
sight
of
punishments
which
i
myself
might
have
to
endure
any
day
at
the
caprice
of
my
oppressors
especially
as
john
when
he
saw
me
turn
pale
at
these
frightful
spectacles
had
a
habit
of
saying
in
a
mocking
tone
that
s
what
i
ll
do
to
you
when
you
are
all
i
know
is
that
in
presence
of
such
iniquitous
acts
i
experienced
a
horrible
uneasiness
my
blood
curdled
in
my
veins
my
throat
began
to
close
and
i
had
to
rush
away
so
as
not
to
repeat
the
cries
which
pierced
my
ears
in
time
however
i
became
somewhat
hardened
to
these
terrible
impressions
the
fibres
of
feeling
grew
tougher
and
habit
gave
me
power
to
hide
what
they
termed
my
cowardice
i
even
felt
ashamed
of
the
signs
of
weakness
i
showed
and
forced
my
face
into
the
hyena
smile
which
i
saw
on
the
faces
of
my
kinsmen
but
i
could
never
prevent
convulsive
shudders
from
running
through
my
limbs
and
the
coldness
as
of
death
from
falling
on
my
heart
at
the
recollection
of
these
scenes
of
agony
the
women
dragged
half
by
force
under
the
roof
of
caused
me
inconceivable
agitation
i
began
to
feel
the
fires
of
youth
kindling
within
me
and
even
to
look
with
envy
on
this
part
of
my
uncles
spoil
but
with
these
desires
were
mingled
inexpressible
pangs
to
all
around
me
women
were
merely
objects
of
contempt
and
vainly
did
i
try
to
separate
this
idea
from
that
of
the
pleasure
which
was
luring
me
my
mind
was
bewildered
and
my
irritated
nerves
imparted
a
violent
and
sickly
strain
to
all
my
temptations
in
other
matters
i
had
as
vile
a
disposition
as
my
companions
if
my
heart
was
better
than
theirs
my
manners
were
no
less
arrogant
and
my
jokes
in
no
better
taste
and
here
it
may
be
well
to
give
you
an
illustration
of
my
youthful
malice
especially
as
the
results
of
these
events
have
had
an
influence
on
the
rest
of
my
life
iii
some
three
leagues
from
on
your
way
to
fromental
you
must
have
noticed
an
old
tower
standing
by
itself
in
the
middle
of
the
woods
it
is
famous
for
the
tragic
death
of
a
prisoner
about
a
century
ago
the
executioner
on
his
rounds
thought
good
to
hang
him
without
any
further
formality
merely
to
gratify
an
old
mauprat
his
overlord
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
gazeau
tower
was
already
deserted
and
falling
into
ruins
it
was
state
property
and
more
from
negligence
than
kindness
the
authorities
had
allowed
a
poor
old
fellow
to
take
up
his
abode
there
he
was
quite
a
character
used
to
live
completely
alone
and
was
known
in
the
district
as
gaffer
patience
yes
i
interrupted
i
have
heard
my
nurse
s
grandmother
speak
of
him
she
believed
he
was
a
exactly
so
and
while
we
are
at
this
point
let
me
tell
you
what
sort
of
a
man
this
patience
really
was
for
i
shall
have
to
speak
of
him
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
my
story
i
had
opportunities
of
studying
him
thoroughly
patience
then
was
a
rustic
philosopher
heaven
had
endowed
him
with
a
keen
intellect
but
he
had
had
little
education
by
a
sort
of
strange
fatality
his
brain
had
doggedly
resisted
the
little
instruction
he
might
have
received
for
instance
he
had
been
to
the
carmelite
s
school
at
and
instead
of
showing
any
aptitude
for
work
he
had
played
truant
with
a
keener
delight
than
any
of
his
his
was
an
eminently
contemplative
nature
kindly
and
indolent
but
proud
and
almost
savage
in
its
love
of
independence
religious
yet
opposed
to
all
authority
somewhat
captious
very
suspicious
and
inexorable
with
hypocrites
the
observances
of
the
cloister
inspired
him
with
but
little
awe
and
as
a
result
of
once
or
twice
speaking
his
mind
too
freely
to
the
monks
he
was
expelled
from
the
school
from
that
time
forth
he
was
the
sworn
foe
of
what
he
called
monkism
and
declared
openly
for
the
cure
of
the
briantes
who
was
accused
of
being
a
jansenist
in
the
instruction
of
patience
however
the
cure
succeeded
no
better
than
the
monks
the
young
peasant
endowed
though
he
was
with
herculean
strength
and
a
great
desire
for
knowledge
displayed
an
unconquerable
aversion
for
every
kind
of
work
whether
physical
or
mental
he
professed
a
sort
of
artless
philosophy
which
the
cure
found
it
very
difficult
to
argue
against
there
was
he
said
no
need
for
a
man
to
work
as
long
as
he
did
not
want
money
and
he
was
in
no
need
of
money
as
long
as
his
wants
were
moderate
patience
practised
what
he
preached
during
the
years
when
passions
are
so
powerful
he
lived
a
life
of
austerity
drank
nothing
but
water
never
entered
a
tavern
and
never
joined
in
a
dance
he
was
always
very
awkward
and
shy
with
women
who
it
must
be
owned
found
little
to
please
in
his
eccentric
character
stern
face
and
somewhat
sarcastic
wit
as
if
to
avenge
himself
for
this
by
showing
his
contempt
or
to
console
himself
by
displaying
his
wisdom
he
took
a
pleasure
like
diogenes
of
old
in
decrying
the
vain
pleasures
of
others
and
if
at
times
he
was
to
be
seen
passing
under
the
branches
in
the
middle
of
the
fetes
it
was
merely
to
throw
out
some
shaft
of
scorn
a
flash
from
his
inexorable
good
sense
sometimes
too
his
uncompromising
morality
found
expression
in
biting
words
which
left
clouds
of
sadness
or
fear
hanging
over
agitated
consciences
this
naturally
gained
him
violent
enemies
and
the
efforts
of
impotent
hatred
helped
by
the
feeling
of
awe
which
his
eccentric
behaviour
produced
fastened
upon
him
the
reputation
of
a
sorcerer
when
i
said
that
patience
was
lacking
in
education
i
expressed
myself
badly
longing
for
a
knowledge
of
the
sublime
mysteries
of
nature
his
mind
wished
to
soar
to
heaven
on
its
first
flight
from
the
very
beginning
the
jansenist
vicar
was
so
perplexed
and
startled
by
the
audacity
of
his
pupil
he
had
to
say
so
much
to
calm
him
into
submission
he
was
obliged
to
sustain
such
assaults
of
bold
questions
and
proud
objections
that
he
had
no
leisure
to
teach
him
the
alphabet
and
at
the
end
of
ten
years
of
studies
broken
off
and
taken
up
at
the
bidding
of
a
whim
or
on
compulsion
patience
could
not
even
read
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
after
poring
over
a
book
for
some
two
hours
that
he
deciphered
a
single
page
and
even
then
he
did
not
grasp
the
meaning
of
most
of
the
words
expressing
abstract
ideas
yet
these
abstract
ideas
were
undoubtedly
in
him
you
felt
their
presence
while
watching
and
listening
to
him
and
the
way
in
which
he
managed
to
embody
them
in
homely
phrase
enlivened
with
a
rude
poetry
was
so
marvellous
that
one
scarcely
knew
whether
to
feel
astounded
or
amused
always
serious
always
positive
himself
he
scorned
dalliance
with
any
dialectic
a
stoic
by
nature
and
on
principle
enthusiastic
in
the
propagation
of
his
doctrine
of
severance
from
false
ideas
but
resolute
in
the
practice
of
resignation
he
made
many
a
breach
in
the
poor
cure
s
defences
and
it
was
in
these
discussions
as
he
often
told
me
in
his
last
years
that
he
acquired
his
knowledge
of
philosophy
in
order
to
make
a
stand
against
the
of
natural
logic
the
worthy
jansenist
was
obliged
to
invoke
the
testimony
of
all
the
fathers
of
the
church
and
to
oppose
these
often
even
to
corroborate
them
with
the
teaching
of
all
the
sages
and
scholars
of
antiquity
then
patience
his
round
eyes
starting
from
his
head
this
was
his
own
expression
lapsed
into
silence
and
delighted
to
learn
without
having
the
bother
of
studying
would
ask
for
long
explanations
of
the
doctrines
of
these
men
and
for
an
account
of
their
lives
noticing
this
attention
and
this
silence
his
adversary
would
exult
but
just
as
he
thought
he
had
convinced
this
rebellious
soul
patience
hearing
the
village
clock
strike
midnight
would
rise
take
an
affectionate
leave
of
his
host
and
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
vicarage
would
dismay
the
good
man
with
some
laconic
and
cutting
comment
that
confounded
saint
jerome
and
plato
alike
eusebius
equally
with
seneca
tertullian
no
less
than
aristotle
the
cure
was
not
too
ready
to
acknowledge
the
superiority
of
this
untutored
intellect
still
he
was
quite
astonished
at
passing
so
many
winter
evenings
by
his
fireside
with
this
peasant
without
feeling
either
bored
or
tired
and
he
would
wonder
how
it
was
that
the
village
schoolmaster
and
even
the
prior
of
the
convent
in
spite
of
their
greek
and
latin
appeared
to
him
the
one
a
bore
the
other
a
sophist
in
all
their
discussions
knowing
the
perfect
purity
of
the
peasant
s
life
he
attributed
the
ascendency
of
his
mind
to
the
power
of
virtue
and
the
charm
it
spreads
over
all
things
then
each
evening
he
would
humbly
accuse
himself
before
god
of
not
having
disputed
with
his
pupil
from
a
sufficiently
christian
point
of
view
he
would
confess
to
his
guardian
angel
that
pride
in
his
own
learning
and
joy
at
being
listened
to
so
devoutly
had
carried
him
somewhat
beyond
the
bounds
of
religious
instruction
that
he
had
quoted
profane
writers
too
complacently
that
he
had
even
experienced
a
dangerous
pleasure
in
roaming
with
his
disciple
through
the
fields
of
the
past
plucking
pagan
flowers
unsprinkled
by
the
waters
of
baptism
flowers
in
whose
fragrance
a
priest
should
not
have
found
such
delight
on
his
side
patience
loved
the
cure
dearly
he
was
his
only
friend
his
only
bond
of
union
with
society
his
only
bond
of
union
through
the
light
of
knowledge
with
god
the
peasant
largely
his
pastor
s
learning
he
did
not
know
that
even
the
most
enlightened
men
often
draw
wrong
conclusions
or
no
conclusions
at
all
from
the
course
of
progress
patience
would
have
been
spared
great
distress
of
mind
if
he
could
have
seen
for
certain
that
his
master
was
frequently
mistaken
and
that
it
was
the
man
not
the
truth
that
was
at
fault
not
knowing
this
and
finding
the
experience
of
the
ages
at
variance
with
his
innate
sense
of
justice
he
was
continually
a
prey
to
agonizing
reveries
and
living
by
himself
and
wandering
through
the
country
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
wrapped
in
thoughts
undreamed
of
by
his
fellows
he
gave
more
and
more
credit
to
the
tales
of
sorcery
reported
against
him
the
convent
did
not
like
the
pastor
a
few
monks
whom
patience
had
unmasked
hated
patience
hence
both
pastor
and
pupil
were
persecuted
the
ignorant
monks
did
not
scruple
to
accuse
the
cure
to
his
bishop
of
devoting
himself
to
the
occult
sciences
in
concert
with
the
magician
patience
a
sort
of
religious
war
broke
out
in
the
village
and
neighbourhood
all
who
were
not
for
the
convent
were
for
the
cure
and
patience
scorned
to
take
part
in
this
struggle
one
morning
he
went
to
see
his
friend
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
said
to
him
you
are
the
one
man
in
all
the
world
that
i
love
and
i
will
not
have
you
persecuted
on
my
account
since
after
you
i
neither
know
nor
care
for
a
soul
i
am
going
off
to
live
in
the
woods
like
the
men
of
primitive
times
i
have
inherited
a
field
which
brings
me
in
fifty
francs
a
year
it
is
the
only
land
i
have
ever
stirred
with
these
hands
and
half
its
wretched
rent
has
gone
to
pay
the
tithe
of
labour
i
owe
the
seignior
i
trust
to
die
without
ever
doing
duty
as
a
beast
of
burden
for
others
and
yet
should
they
remove
you
from
your
office
or
rob
you
of
your
income
if
you
have
a
field
that
needs
ploughing
only
send
me
word
and
you
will
see
that
these
arms
have
not
grown
altogether
stiff
in
their
it
was
in
vain
that
the
pastor
opposed
this
resolve
patience
departed
carrying
with
him
as
his
only
belonging
the
coat
he
had
on
his
back
and
an
abridgment
of
the
teachings
of
epictetus
for
this
book
he
had
a
great
affection
and
thanks
to
much
study
of
it
could
read
as
many
as
three
of
its
pages
a
day
without
unduly
tiring
himself
the
rustic
anchorite
went
into
the
desert
to
live
at
first
he
built
himself
a
hut
of
branches
in
a
wood
then
as
wolves
attacked
him
he
took
refuge
in
one
of
the
lower
halls
of
gazeau
tower
which
he
furnished
luxuriously
with
a
bed
of
moss
and
some
stumps
of
trees
wild
roots
wild
fruit
and
goat
s
milk
constituted
a
daily
fare
very
little
inferior
to
what
he
had
had
in
the
village
this
is
no
exaggeration
you
have
to
see
the
peasants
in
certain
parts
of
varenne
to
form
an
idea
of
the
frugal
diet
on
which
a
man
can
live
and
keep
in
good
health
in
the
midst
of
these
men
of
stoical
habits
all
round
him
patience
was
still
exceptional
never
had
wine
reddened
his
lips
and
bread
had
seemed
to
him
a
superfluity
besides
the
doctrine
of
pythagoras
was
not
wholly
displeasing
to
him
and
in
the
rare
interviews
which
he
henceforth
had
with
his
friend
he
would
declare
that
without
exactly
believing
in
metempsychosis
and
without
making
it
a
rule
to
eat
vegetables
only
he
felt
a
secret
joy
at
being
able
to
live
thus
and
at
having
no
further
occasion
to
see
death
dealt
out
every
day
to
innocent
animals
patience
had
formed
this
curious
resolution
at
the
age
of
forty
he
was
sixty
when
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
and
he
was
then
possessed
of
extraordinary
physical
vigour
in
truth
he
was
in
the
habit
of
roaming
about
the
country
every
year
however
in
proportion
as
i
tell
you
about
my
own
life
i
shall
give
you
details
of
the
hermit
life
of
patience
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
about
to
speak
the
forest
rangers
more
from
fear
of
his
casting
a
spell
over
them
than
out
of
compassion
had
finally
ceased
their
persecutions
and
given
him
full
permission
to
live
in
gazeau
tower
not
however
without
warning
him
that
it
would
probably
fall
about
his
head
during
the
first
gale
of
wind
to
this
patience
had
replied
philosophically
that
if
he
was
destined
to
be
crushed
to
death
the
first
tree
in
the
forest
would
do
the
work
quite
as
well
as
the
walls
of
gazeau
tower
before
putting
my
actor
patience
on
the
stage
and
with
many
apologies
for
inflicting
on
you
such
a
long
preliminary
biography
i
have
still
to
mention
that
during
the
twenty
years
of
which
i
have
spoken
the
cure
s
mind
had
bowed
to
a
new
power
he
loved
philosophy
and
in
spite
of
himself
dear
man
could
not
prevent
this
love
from
embracing
the
philosophers
too
even
the
least
orthodox
the
works
of
jean
jacques
rousseau
carried
him
away
into
new
regions
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
at
resistance
and
when
one
morning
when
returning
from
a
visit
to
some
sick
folk
he
came
across
patience
gathering
his
dinner
of
herbs
from
the
rocks
of
crevant
he
sat
down
near
him
on
one
of
the
druidical
stones
and
made
without
knowing
it
the
profession
of
faith
of
the
savoyard
vicar
patience
drank
more
willingly
of
this
poetic
religion
than
of
the
ancient
orthodoxy
the
pleasure
with
which
he
listened
to
a
summary
of
the
new
doctrines
led
the
cure
to
arrange
secret
meetings
with
him
in
isolated
parts
of
varenne
where
they
agreed
to
come
upon
each
other
as
if
by
chance
at
these
mysterious
interviews
the
imagination
of
patience
fresh
and
ardent
from
long
solitude
was
fired
with
all
the
magic
of
the
thoughts
and
hopes
which
were
then
fermenting
in
france
from
the
court
of
versailles
to
the
most
uninhabitable
heath
he
became
enamoured
of
jean
jacques
and
made
the
cure
read
as
much
of
him
as
he
possibly
could
without
neglecting
his
duties
then
he
begged
a
copy
of
the
and
hastened
to
gazeau
tower
to
spell
his
way
through
it
feverishly
at
first
the
cure
had
given
him
of
this
manna
only
with
a
sparing
hand
and
while
making
him
admire
the
lofty
thoughts
and
noble
sentiments
of
the
philosopher
had
thought
to
put
him
on
his
guard
against
the
poison
of
anarchy
but
all
the
old
learning
all
the
happy
texts
of
bygone
days
in
a
word
all
the
theology
of
the
worthy
priest
was
swept
away
like
a
fragile
bridge
by
the
torrent
of
wild
eloquence
and
ungovernable
enthusiasm
which
patience
had
accumulated
in
his
desert
the
vicar
had
to
give
way
and
fall
back
terrified
upon
himself
there
he
discovered
that
the
shrine
of
his
own
science
was
everywhere
cracking
and
crumbling
to
ruin
the
new
sun
which
was
rising
on
the
political
horizon
and
making
havoc
in
so
many
minds
melted
his
own
like
a
light
snow
under
the
first
breath
of
spring
the
sublime
enthusiasm
of
patience
the
strange
poetic
life
of
the
man
which
seemed
to
reveal
him
as
one
inspired
the
romantic
turn
which
their
mysterious
relations
were
taking
the
ignoble
persecutions
of
the
convent
making
it
noble
to
revolt
all
this
so
worked
upon
the
priest
that
by
he
had
already
travelled
far
from
jansenism
and
was
vainly
searching
all
the
religious
heresies
for
some
spot
on
which
he
might
rest
before
falling
into
the
abyss
of
philosophy
so
often
opened
at
his
feet
by
patience
so
often
hidden
in
vain
by
the
exorcisms
of
roman
theology
iv
after
this
account
of
the
philosophical
life
of
patience
set
forth
by
me
now
in
manhood
continued
bernard
after
a
pause
it
is
not
altogether
easy
to
return
to
the
very
different
impressions
i
received
in
boyhood
on
meeting
the
wizard
of
gazeau
tower
i
will
make
an
effort
however
to
reproduce
my
recollections
faithfully
it
was
one
summer
evening
as
i
was
returning
from
with
several
that
i
passed
gazeau
tower
for
the
first
time
my
age
was
about
thirteen
and
i
was
bigger
and
stronger
than
any
of
my
comrades
besides
i
exercised
over
them
sternly
enough
the
authority
i
drew
from
my
noble
birth
in
fact
the
mixture
of
familiarity
and
etiquette
in
our
intercourse
was
rather
fantastic
sometimes
when
the
excitement
of
sport
or
the
fatigue
of
the
day
had
greater
powers
over
them
than
i
they
used
to
have
their
own
way
and
i
already
knew
how
to
yield
at
the
right
moment
as
tyrants
do
so
as
always
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
being
compelled
however
i
generally
found
a
chance
for
revenge
and
soon
saw
them
trembling
before
the
hated
name
of
my
family
well
night
was
coming
on
and
we
were
walking
along
gaily
whistling
knocking
down
with
stones
imitating
the
notes
of
birds
when
the
boy
who
was
ahead
suddenly
stopped
and
coming
back
to
us
declared
that
he
was
not
going
by
the
gazeau
tower
path
but
would
rather
cut
across
the
wood
this
idea
was
favoured
by
two
others
a
third
objected
that
we
ran
the
risk
of
losing
ourselves
if
we
left
the
path
that
night
was
near
and
that
there
were
plenty
of
wolves
about
come
on
you
funks
i
cried
in
a
princely
tone
pushing
forward
the
guide
follow
the
path
and
have
done
with
this
not
me
said
the
youngster
i
ve
just
seen
the
sorcerer
at
his
door
saying
magic
words
and
i
don
t
want
to
have
a
fever
all
the
bah
said
another
he
doesn
t
do
harm
to
everybody
he
never
hurts
children
and
besides
we
have
only
to
pass
by
very
quietly
without
saying
anything
to
him
what
do
you
suppose
he
ll
do
to
us
oh
it
would
be
all
right
if
we
were
alone
answered
the
first
but
bernard
is
here
we
re
sure
to
have
a
spell
cast
on
what
do
you
say
you
fool
i
cried
doubling
my
fist
it
s
not
my
fault
my
lord
replied
the
boy
that
old
wretch
doesn
t
like
the
gentry
and
he
has
said
he
would
be
glad
to
see
tristan
and
all
his
sons
hanging
from
the
same
he
said
that
did
he
good
i
answered
come
on
and
you
shall
see
all
who
are
my
friends
will
follow
any
one
that
leaves
me
is
a
two
of
my
companions
out
of
vanity
let
themselves
be
drawn
on
the
others
pretended
to
imitate
them
but
after
a
few
steps
they
had
all
taken
flight
and
disappeared
into
the
copse
however
i
went
on
proudly
escorted
by
my
two
acolytes
little
sylvain
who
was
in
front
took
off
his
hat
as
soon
as
he
saw
patience
in
the
distance
and
when
we
arrived
opposite
him
though
the
man
was
looking
on
the
ground
without
appearing
to
notice
us
he
was
seized
with
terror
and
said
in
a
trembling
voice
good
evening
master
patience
a
good
night
s
rest
to
the
sorcerer
roused
out
of
his
reverie
started
like
a
man
waked
from
sleep
and
i
saw
not
without
a
certain
emotion
his
face
half
covered
with
a
thick
gray
beard
his
big
head
was
quite
bald
and
the
bareness
of
his
forehead
only
served
to
make
his
bushy
eyebrows
more
prominent
behind
these
his
round
deepset
eyes
seemed
to
flash
like
lightning
at
the
end
of
summer
behind
the
fading
foliage
he
was
of
small
stature
but
very
in
fact
built
like
a
gladiator
the
rags
in
which
he
was
clad
were
defiantly
filthy
his
face
was
short
and
of
a
vulgar
type
like
that
of
socrates
and
if
the
fire
of
genius
glowed
in
his
strongly
marked
features
i
certainly
could
not
perceive
it
he
appeared
to
me
a
wild
beast
an
unclean
animal
filled
with
a
sense
of
loathing
and
determined
to
avenge
the
insult
he
had
offered
to
my
name
i
put
a
stone
in
my
sling
and
without
further
ado
hurled
it
at
him
with
all
my
might
at
the
moment
the
stone
flew
out
patience
was
in
the
act
of
replying
to
the
boy
s
greeting
good
evening
lads
god
be
with
you
he
was
saying
when
the
stone
whistled
past
his
ear
and
struck
a
tame
owl
of
which
patience
had
made
a
pet
and
which
at
the
approach
of
night
was
beginning
to
rouse
itself
in
the
ivy
above
the
door
the
owl
gave
a
piercing
cry
and
fell
bleeding
at
the
feet
of
its
master
who
answered
it
with
a
roar
of
anger
for
a
few
seconds
he
stood
motionless
with
surprise
and
fury
then
suddenly
taking
the
palpitating
victim
by
the
feet
he
lifted
it
up
and
coming
towards
us
cried
in
a
voice
of
thunder
which
of
you
wretches
threw
that
stone
the
boy
who
had
been
walking
behind
flew
with
the
swiftness
of
the
wind
but
sylvain
seized
by
the
great
hand
of
the
sorcerer
fell
upon
his
knees
swearing
by
the
holy
virgin
and
by
saint
solange
the
patroness
of
berry
that
he
was
innocent
of
the
death
of
the
bird
i
felt
i
confess
a
strong
inclination
to
let
him
get
out
of
the
scrape
as
best
he
could
and
make
my
escape
into
the
thicket
i
had
expected
to
see
a
decrepit
old
juggler
not
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
robust
enemy
but
pride
held
me
back
if
you
did
this
said
patience
to
my
trembling
comrade
i
pity
you
for
you
are
a
wicked
child
and
you
will
grow
into
a
dishonest
man
you
have
done
a
bad
deed
you
have
made
it
your
pleasure
to
cause
pain
to
an
old
man
who
never
did
you
any
harm
and
you
have
done
this
treacherously
like
a
coward
while
feigning
politeness
and
bidding
him
you
are
a
liar
a
miscreant
you
have
robbed
me
of
my
only
society
my
only
riches
you
have
taken
delight
in
evil
god
preserve
you
from
living
if
you
are
going
on
in
this
oh
monsieur
patience
cried
the
boy
clasping
his
hands
do
not
curse
me
do
not
bewitch
me
do
not
give
me
any
illness
it
wasn
t
i
may
god
strike
me
dead
if
it
was
if
it
wasn
t
you
it
was
this
one
then
said
patience
seizing
me
by
the
and
shaking
me
like
a
young
tree
to
be
uprooted
yes
i
did
it
i
replied
haughtily
and
if
you
wish
to
know
my
name
learn
that
i
am
called
bernard
mauprat
and
that
a
peasant
who
lays
a
hand
on
a
nobleman
deserves
death
you
you
would
put
me
to
death
mauprat
cried
the
old
man
petrified
with
surprise
and
indignation
and
what
would
god
be
then
if
a
brat
like
you
had
a
right
to
threaten
a
man
of
my
age
death
ah
you
are
a
genuine
mauprat
and
you
bite
like
your
breed
cursed
whelp
such
things
as
they
talk
of
putting
to
death
the
very
moment
they
are
born
death
my
do
you
know
it
is
yourself
who
deserves
death
not
for
what
you
have
just
done
but
for
being
the
son
of
your
father
and
the
nephew
of
your
uncles
ah
i
am
glad
to
hold
a
mauprat
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
and
see
whether
a
cur
of
a
nobleman
weighs
as
much
as
a
as
he
spoke
he
lifted
me
from
the
ground
as
he
would
have
lifted
a
hare
little
one
he
said
to
my
comrade
you
can
run
home
you
needn
t
be
afraid
patience
rarely
gets
angry
with
his
equals
and
he
always
pardons
his
brothers
because
his
brothers
are
ignorant
like
himself
and
know
not
what
they
do
but
a
mauprat
look
you
is
a
thing
that
knows
how
to
read
and
write
and
is
only
the
viler
for
it
all
run
away
then
but
no
stay
i
should
like
you
once
in
your
life
to
see
a
nobleman
receive
a
thrashing
from
the
hand
of
a
peasant
and
that
is
what
you
are
going
to
see
and
i
ask
you
not
to
forget
it
little
one
and
to
tell
your
parents
about
livid
and
gnashing
my
teeth
with
rage
i
made
desperate
efforts
to
resist
patience
with
hideous
calmness
bound
me
to
a
tree
with
an
osier
shoot
at
the
touch
of
his
great
horny
hand
i
bent
like
a
reed
and
yet
i
was
remarkably
strong
for
my
age
he
fixed
the
owl
to
a
branch
above
my
head
and
the
bird
s
blood
as
it
fell
on
me
drop
by
drop
caused
me
unspeakable
horror
for
though
this
was
only
the
correction
we
administer
to
sporting
dogs
that
worry
game
my
brain
bewildered
by
rage
despair
and
my
comrades
cries
began
to
imagine
some
frightful
witchcraft
however
i
really
think
i
would
rather
have
been
metamorphosed
into
an
owl
at
once
than
undergo
the
punishment
he
inflicted
on
me
in
vain
did
i
fling
threats
at
him
in
vain
did
i
take
terrible
vows
of
vengeance
in
vain
did
the
peasant
child
throw
himself
on
his
knees
again
and
supplicate
monsieur
patience
for
god
s
sake
for
your
own
sake
don
t
harm
him
the
mauprats
will
kill
he
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
taking
a
handful
of
holly
twigs
he
flogged
me
in
a
manner
i
must
own
more
humiliating
than
cruel
for
no
sooner
did
he
see
a
few
drops
of
my
blood
appear
than
he
stopped
and
threw
down
the
rod
i
even
noticed
a
sudden
softening
of
his
features
and
voice
as
if
he
were
sorry
for
his
severity
mauprat
he
said
crossing
his
arms
on
his
breast
and
looking
at
me
fixedly
you
have
now
been
punished
you
have
now
been
insulted
my
fine
gentleman
that
is
enough
for
me
as
you
see
i
might
easily
prevent
you
from
ever
harming
me
by
stopping
your
breath
with
a
touch
of
my
finger
and
burying
you
under
the
stone
at
my
door
who
would
think
of
coming
to
gaffer
patience
to
look
for
this
fine
child
of
noble
blood
but
as
you
may
also
see
i
am
not
fond
of
vengeance
at
the
first
cry
of
pain
that
escaped
you
i
stopped
no
i
don
t
like
to
cause
suffering
i
m
not
a
mauprat
still
it
was
well
for
you
to
learn
by
experience
what
is
to
be
a
victim
may
this
disgust
you
of
the
hangman
s
trade
which
had
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
in
your
family
you
can
go
now
i
no
longer
bear
you
malice
the
justice
of
god
is
satisfied
you
can
tell
your
uncles
to
put
me
on
their
gridiron
they
will
have
a
tough
morsel
to
eat
and
they
will
swallow
flesh
that
will
come
to
life
again
in
their
gullets
and
choke
then
he
picked
up
the
dead
owl
and
looking
at
it
sadly
a
peasant
s
child
would
not
have
done
this
he
said
this
is
sport
for
gentle
as
he
retired
to
his
door
he
gave
utterance
to
an
exclamation
which
escaped
him
only
on
solemn
occasions
and
from
which
he
derived
his
curious
surname
patience
patience
he
cried
this
according
to
the
gossips
was
a
cabalistic
formula
of
his
and
whenever
he
had
been
heard
to
pronounce
it
some
misfortune
had
happened
to
the
individual
who
had
offended
him
sylvain
crossed
himself
to
ward
off
the
evil
spirit
the
terrible
words
resounded
through
the
tower
into
which
patience
had
just
withdrawn
then
the
door
closed
behind
him
with
a
bang
my
comrade
was
so
eager
to
be
off
that
he
was
within
an
ace
of
leaving
me
there
bound
to
the
tree
as
soon
as
he
had
released
me
he
exclaimed
a
sign
of
the
cross
for
god
s
sake
a
sign
of
the
cross
if
you
don
t
cross
yourself
you
are
bewitched
we
shall
be
devoured
by
wolves
as
we
go
or
else
we
shall
meet
the
great
idiot
i
said
i
have
something
else
to
think
about
listen
if
you
are
ever
unlucky
enough
to
tell
a
single
soul
of
what
has
happened
i
will
strangle
alas
sir
what
am
i
to
do
he
replied
with
a
mixture
of
innocence
and
malice
the
sorcerer
said
i
was
to
tell
my
i
raised
my
fist
to
strike
him
but
my
strength
failed
choking
with
rage
at
the
treatment
i
had
just
undergone
i
fell
down
almost
in
a
faint
and
sylvain
seized
the
opportunity
for
flight
when
i
came
to
i
found
myself
alone
i
did
not
know
this
part
of
varenne
i
had
never
been
here
before
and
it
was
horribly
wild
all
through
the
day
i
had
seen
tracks
of
wolves
and
wild
boars
in
the
sand
and
now
night
had
come
and
i
was
still
two
leagues
from
the
gate
would
be
shut
the
drawbridge
up
and
i
should
get
a
bullet
through
me
if
i
tried
to
enter
after
nine
o
clock
as
i
did
not
know
the
way
it
was
a
hundred
to
one
against
my
doing
the
two
leagues
in
an
hour
however
i
would
have
preferred
to
die
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
ask
shelter
of
the
man
in
gazeau
tower
even
had
he
granted
it
gracefully
my
pride
was
bleeding
more
than
my
flesh
i
started
off
at
a
run
heedless
of
all
risks
the
path
made
a
thousand
turns
a
thousand
other
paths
kept
crossing
it
when
i
reached
the
plain
i
found
myself
in
a
pasture
surrounded
by
hedges
there
every
trace
of
the
path
disappeared
i
jumped
the
hedge
at
a
venture
and
fell
into
a
field
the
night
was
even
had
it
been
day
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
ascertain
my
way
in
the
midst
of
little
properties
buried
between
high
banks
bristling
with
thorns
finally
i
reached
a
heath
then
some
woods
and
my
fears
which
had
been
somewhat
subdued
now
grew
intense
yes
i
own
i
was
a
prey
to
mortal
terrors
trained
to
bravery
as
a
dog
is
to
sport
i
bore
myself
well
enough
before
others
spurred
by
vanity
indeed
i
was
foolishly
bold
when
i
had
spectators
but
left
to
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
night
exhausted
by
toil
and
hunger
though
with
no
longing
for
food
unhinged
by
the
emotions
i
had
just
experienced
certain
that
my
uncles
would
beat
me
when
i
returned
yet
as
anxious
to
return
as
if
i
were
going
to
find
paradise
on
earth
at
i
wandered
about
until
daybreak
suffering
indescribable
agonies
the
howls
of
wolves
happily
far
off
more
than
once
reached
my
ears
and
froze
the
blood
in
my
veins
and
as
if
my
position
had
not
been
perilous
enough
in
reality
my
overwrought
imagination
must
needs
add
to
it
a
thousand
extravagant
fantasies
patience
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
this
as
you
know
is
a
cabalistic
speciality
accredited
in
all
countries
i
kept
on
fancying
therefore
that
i
saw
this
devilish
little
escorted
by
his
ravening
pack
and
himself
in
the
form
of
a
pursing
me
through
the
woods
several
times
when
rabbits
got
up
at
my
feet
i
almost
fell
backwards
from
the
shock
and
now
as
i
was
certain
that
nobody
could
see
i
made
many
a
sign
of
the
cross
for
while
affecting
incredulity
i
was
of
course
at
heart
filled
with
all
the
superstitions
born
of
fear
at
last
at
daybreak
i
reached
i
waited
in
a
moat
until
the
gates
were
opened
and
then
slipped
up
to
my
room
without
being
seen
by
anybody
as
it
was
not
altogether
an
unfailing
tenderness
that
watched
over
me
at
my
absence
had
not
been
noticed
during
the
night
meeting
my
uncle
john
on
the
stairs
i
led
him
to
believe
that
i
had
just
got
up
and
as
the
artifice
proved
successful
i
went
off
to
the
hayloft
and
slept
for
the
rest
of
the
day
v
as
i
had
nothing
further
to
fear
for
myself
it
would
have
been
easy
to
take
vengeance
on
my
enemy
everything
was
favourable
the
words
he
had
uttered
against
my
family
would
have
been
sufficient
without
any
mention
of
the
outrage
done
to
my
own
person
which
in
truth
i
hardly
cared
to
make
known
i
had
only
to
say
a
word
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
seven
mauprats
would
have
been
in
the
saddle
delighted
at
the
opportunity
of
making
an
example
of
a
man
who
paid
them
no
dues
such
a
man
would
have
seemed
to
them
good
for
nothing
but
hanging
as
a
warning
to
others
but
even
if
things
had
not
been
likely
to
reach
this
pitch
i
somehow
felt
an
unconquerable
aversion
to
asking
eight
men
to
avenge
me
on
a
single
one
just
as
i
was
about
to
ask
them
for
in
my
anger
i
had
firmly
resolved
to
do
so
i
was
held
back
by
some
instinct
for
fair
dealing
to
which
i
had
hitherto
been
a
stranger
and
whose
presence
in
myself
i
could
hardly
explain
perhaps
too
the
words
of
patience
had
unknown
to
myself
aroused
in
me
a
healthy
sense
of
shame
perhaps
his
righteous
maledictions
on
the
nobles
had
given
me
glimpses
of
the
idea
of
justice
perhaps
in
short
what
i
had
hitherto
despised
in
myself
as
impulses
of
weakness
and
compassion
henceforth
began
dimly
to
take
a
more
solemn
and
less
contemptible
shape
be
that
as
it
may
i
kept
silent
i
contented
myself
with
thrashing
sylvain
as
a
punishment
for
having
deserted
me
and
to
impress
upon
him
that
he
was
not
to
breathe
a
word
about
my
unfortunate
adventure
the
bitterness
of
the
recollection
was
intensified
by
an
incident
which
happened
toward
the
end
of
autumn
when
i
was
out
with
him
beating
the
woods
for
game
the
poor
boy
was
genuinely
attached
to
me
for
my
brutality
notwithstanding
he
always
used
to
be
at
my
heels
the
instant
i
was
outside
the
castle
when
any
of
his
companions
spoke
ill
of
me
he
would
take
up
my
cause
and
declare
that
i
was
merely
somewhat
hasty
and
not
really
bad
at
heart
ah
it
is
the
gentle
resigned
souls
of
the
humble
that
keep
up
the
pride
and
roughness
of
the
great
well
we
were
trying
to
trap
larks
when
my
page
who
always
hunted
about
ahead
of
me
came
back
saying
in
his
rude
dialect
i
can
see
the
with
the
this
announcement
sent
a
shudder
through
all
my
limbs
however
the
longing
for
revenge
produced
a
reaction
and
i
marched
straight
on
to
meet
the
sorcerer
perhaps
too
i
felt
somewhat
reassured
by
the
presence
of
his
companion
who
was
a
frequenter
of
and
would
be
likely
to
show
me
respect
and
afford
me
assistance
marcasse
the
as
he
was
called
professed
to
rid
the
dwellings
and
fields
of
the
district
of
polecats
weasels
rats
and
other
vermin
nor
did
he
confine
his
good
offices
to
berry
every
year
he
went
the
round
of
la
marche
nivernais
limousin
and
saintonge
visiting
alone
and
on
foot
all
the
places
that
had
the
good
sense
to
appreciate
his
talents
he
was
well
received
everywhere
in
the
castle
no
less
than
in
the
cottage
for
his
was
a
trade
that
had
been
carried
on
successfully
and
honestly
in
his
family
for
generations
indeed
his
descendants
still
carry
it
on
thus
he
had
work
and
a
home
awaiting
him
for
every
day
in
the
year
as
regular
in
his
round
as
the
earth
in
her
rotation
he
would
reappear
on
a
given
day
at
the
very
place
where
he
had
appeared
the
year
before
and
always
with
the
same
dog
and
with
the
same
long
sword
this
personage
was
as
curious
as
the
sorcerer
patience
perhaps
more
comic
in
his
way
than
the
sorcerer
he
was
a
bilious
melancholy
man
tall
lean
angular
full
of
languor
dignity
and
deliberation
in
speech
and
action
so
little
did
he
like
talking
that
he
answered
all
questions
in
monosyllables
and
yet
he
never
failed
to
obey
the
laws
of
the
most
scrupulous
politeness
and
rarely
said
a
word
without
raising
his
hand
to
the
corner
of
his
hat
as
a
sign
of
respect
and
civility
was
he
thus
by
nature
or
in
his
itinerant
trade
had
this
wise
reserve
arisen
from
a
fear
of
alienating
some
of
his
numerous
clients
by
incautious
chatter
no
one
knew
in
all
houses
he
was
allowed
a
free
hand
during
the
day
he
had
the
key
of
every
granary
in
the
evening
a
place
at
the
fireside
of
every
kitchen
he
knew
everything
that
happened
for
his
dreamy
absorbed
air
led
people
to
talk
freely
in
his
presence
yet
he
had
never
been
known
to
inform
any
household
of
the
doings
of
another
if
you
wish
to
know
how
i
had
become
struck
by
this
strange
character
i
may
tell
you
that
i
had
been
a
witness
of
my
uncle
s
and
grandfather
s
efforts
to
make
him
talk
they
hoped
to
draw
from
him
some
information
about
the
chateau
of
the
home
of
a
man
they
hated
and
envied
hubert
de
mauprat
although
don
marcasse
they
called
him
don
because
he
seemed
to
have
the
bearing
and
pride
of
a
ruined
hidalgo
although
don
marcasse
i
say
had
shown
himself
as
incompressible
here
as
elsewhere
the
mauprats
never
failed
to
squeeze
him
a
little
more
in
the
hope
of
extracting
some
details
about
the
mauprats
nobody
then
could
discover
marcasse
s
opinions
about
anything
it
would
have
been
simplest
to
suppose
that
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
have
any
yet
the
attraction
which
patience
seemed
to
feel
towards
him
so
great
that
he
would
accompany
him
on
his
travels
for
several
weeks
altogether
led
one
to
believe
that
there
was
some
witchery
in
the
man
s
mysterious
air
and
that
it
was
not
solely
the
length
of
his
sword
and
the
skill
of
his
dog
which
played
such
wonderful
havoc
with
the
moles
and
weasels
there
were
whispered
rumours
of
the
enchanted
herbs
that
he
employed
to
lure
these
suspicious
animals
from
their
holes
into
his
nets
however
as
people
found
themselves
better
off
for
his
magic
no
one
dreamt
of
denouncing
it
as
criminal
i
do
not
know
if
you
have
ever
seen
one
of
the
it
is
a
curious
sight
especially
in
a
the
man
and
dog
climbing
up
ladders
and
running
along
beams
with
marvellous
assurance
and
agility
the
dog
sniffing
every
hole
in
the
wall
playing
the
cat
crouching
down
and
lying
in
wait
until
the
game
comes
out
for
his
master
s
rapier
the
man
thrusting
through
bundles
of
straw
and
putting
the
enemy
to
the
sword
all
this
when
arranged
and
carried
out
with
gravity
and
dignity
by
don
marcasse
was
i
assure
you
a
most
singular
and
interesting
performance
when
i
saw
this
trusty
fellow
i
felt
equal
to
braving
the
sorcerer
and
advanced
boldly
sylvain
stared
at
me
in
admiration
and
i
noticed
that
patience
himself
was
not
prepared
for
such
audacity
i
pretended
to
go
up
to
marcasse
and
speak
to
him
as
though
quite
unconcerned
about
the
presence
of
my
enemy
seeing
this
he
gently
thrust
aside
the
and
laying
his
heavy
hand
on
my
head
said
very
quietly
you
have
grown
of
late
my
fine
gentleman
the
blood
rushed
to
my
face
and
drawing
back
scornfully
i
answered
take
care
what
you
are
doing
clodhopper
you
should
remember
that
if
you
still
have
your
two
ears
it
is
to
my
kindness
that
you
owe
my
two
ears
said
patience
with
a
bitter
laugh
then
making
an
allusion
to
the
nickname
of
my
family
he
added
perhaps
you
mean
my
two
hamstrings
patience
patience
the
time
maybe
is
not
far
distant
when
clodhoppers
will
rid
the
nobles
of
neither
ears
nor
hamstrings
but
of
their
heads
and
their
silence
master
patience
said
the
solemnly
these
are
not
the
words
of
a
you
are
quite
right
quite
right
replied
the
sorcerer
and
in
truth
i
don
t
know
why
i
allow
myself
to
argue
with
this
lad
he
might
have
had
me
made
into
pap
by
his
uncles
i
whipped
him
in
the
summer
for
playing
me
a
stupid
trick
and
i
don
t
know
what
happened
to
the
family
but
the
mauprats
lost
a
fine
chance
of
injuring
a
learn
peasant
i
said
that
a
nobleman
always
takes
vengeance
nobly
i
did
not
want
my
wrongs
avenged
by
people
more
powerful
than
yourself
but
wait
a
couple
of
years
i
promise
i
will
hang
you
with
my
own
hand
on
a
certain
tree
that
i
shall
easily
recognise
not
very
far
from
the
door
of
gazeau
tower
if
i
don
t
i
will
renounce
my
birthright
if
i
spare
you
i
will
take
the
title
of
patience
smiled
then
suddenly
becoming
serious
he
fixed
on
me
that
searching
look
which
rendered
his
physiognomy
so
striking
then
turning
to
the
it
is
strange
he
said
there
must
be
something
in
blood
take
the
vilest
noble
and
you
will
find
that
in
certain
things
he
has
more
spirit
than
the
bravest
of
us
ah
it
is
simple
enough
he
added
speaking
to
himself
they
are
brought
up
like
that
whilst
we
we
they
tell
us
are
born
to
obey
patience
he
was
silent
for
an
instant
then
rousing
himself
from
his
reverie
he
said
to
me
in
a
kindly
though
somewhat
mocking
tone
and
so
you
want
to
hang
me
monseigneur
you
will
have
to
eat
a
lot
of
beef
then
for
you
are
not
yet
tall
enough
to
reach
the
branch
which
is
to
bear
me
and
before
then
perhaps
many
things
will
happen
that
are
not
dreamt
of
in
your
little
nonsense
why
talk
nonsense
said
the
with
a
serious
air
come
make
peace
monseigneur
bernard
i
ask
pardon
for
patience
he
is
an
old
man
a
no
no
said
patience
i
want
him
to
hang
me
he
is
right
this
is
merely
my
due
and
in
fact
it
may
come
more
quickly
than
all
the
rest
you
must
not
make
too
much
haste
to
grow
monsieur
for
i
well
i
am
making
more
haste
to
grow
old
than
i
would
wish
and
you
who
are
so
brave
you
would
not
attack
a
man
no
longer
able
to
defend
you
didn
t
hesitate
to
use
your
strength
against
me
i
cried
confess
now
didn
t
you
treat
me
brutally
wasn
t
it
a
coward
s
work
that
oh
children
children
he
said
see
how
the
thing
reasons
out
of
the
mouths
of
children
cometh
and
he
moved
away
dreamily
and
muttering
to
himself
as
was
his
wont
marcasse
took
off
his
hat
to
me
and
said
in
an
impassive
tone
he
is
wrong
live
at
peace
pardon
peace
farewell
they
disappeared
and
there
ended
my
relations
with
patience
i
did
not
come
in
contact
with
him
again
until
long
afterward
vi
i
was
fifteen
when
my
grandfather
died
at
his
death
caused
no
sorrow
but
infinite
consternation
he
was
the
soul
of
every
vice
that
reigned
therein
and
it
is
certain
that
he
was
more
cruel
though
less
vile
than
his
sons
on
his
death
the
sort
of
glory
which
his
audacity
had
won
for
us
grew
dim
his
sons
hitherto
held
under
firm
control
became
more
and
more
drunken
and
debauched
moreover
each
day
added
some
new
peril
to
their
expeditions
except
for
the
few
trusty
vassals
whom
we
treated
well
and
who
were
all
devoted
to
us
we
were
becoming
more
and
more
isolated
and
resourceless
people
had
left
the
neighbouring
country
in
consequence
of
our
violent
depredations
the
terror
that
we
inspired
pushed
back
daily
the
bounds
of
the
desert
around
us
in
making
our
ventures
we
had
to
go
farther
afield
even
to
the
borders
of
the
plain
there
we
had
not
the
upper
hand
and
my
uncle
laurence
the
boldest
of
us
all
was
dangerously
wounded
in
a
skirmish
other
schemes
had
to
be
devised
john
suggested
them
one
was
that
we
should
slip
into
the
fairs
under
various
disguises
and
exercise
our
skill
in
thieving
from
brigands
we
became
and
our
detested
name
sank
lower
and
lower
in
infamy
we
formed
a
fellowship
with
the
most
noisome
characters
our
province
concealed
and
by
an
exchange
of
rascally
services
once
again
managed
to
avoid
destitution
i
say
we
for
i
was
beginning
to
take
a
place
in
this
band
of
cutthroats
when
my
grandfather
died
he
had
yielded
to
my
entreaties
and
allowed
me
to
join
in
some
of
the
last
expeditions
he
attempted
i
shall
make
no
apologies
but
here
gentlemen
you
behold
a
man
who
has
followed
the
profession
of
a
bandit
i
feel
no
remorse
at
the
recollection
no
more
than
a
soldier
would
feel
at
having
served
a
campaign
under
orders
from
his
general
i
thought
that
i
was
still
living
in
the
middle
ages
the
laws
of
the
land
with
all
their
strength
and
wisdom
were
to
me
words
devoid
of
meaning
i
felt
brave
and
full
of
vigour
fighting
was
a
joy
truly
the
results
of
our
victories
often
made
me
blush
but
as
they
in
no
way
profited
myself
i
washed
my
hands
of
them
nay
i
remember
with
pleasure
that
i
helped
more
than
one
victim
who
had
been
knocked
down
to
get
up
and
escape
this
existence
with
its
movement
its
dangers
and
its
fatigues
had
a
numbing
effect
on
me
it
took
me
away
from
any
painful
reflections
which
might
have
arisen
in
my
mind
besides
it
freed
me
from
the
immediate
tyranny
of
john
however
after
the
death
of
my
grandfather
when
our
band
degraded
itself
to
exploits
of
a
different
nature
i
fell
back
under
his
odious
sway
i
was
by
no
means
fitted
for
lying
and
fraud
i
displayed
not
only
aversion
but
also
incapacity
for
this
new
industry
consequently
my
uncle
looked
upon
me
as
useless
and
began
to
maltreat
me
again
they
would
have
driven
me
away
had
they
not
been
afraid
that
i
might
make
my
peace
with
society
and
become
a
dangerous
enemy
to
themselves
while
they
were
in
doubt
as
to
whether
it
was
wiser
to
feed
me
or
to
live
in
fear
of
me
they
often
thought
as
i
have
since
learned
of
picking
a
quarrel
with
me
and
forcing
a
fight
in
which
i
might
be
got
rid
of
this
was
john
s
suggestion
antony
however
who
retained
more
of
tristan
s
energy
and
love
of
fair
play
at
home
than
any
of
his
brothers
proved
clearly
that
i
did
more
good
than
harm
i
was
he
declared
a
brave
fighter
and
there
was
no
knowing
when
they
might
need
an
extra
hand
i
might
also
be
shaped
into
a
swindler
i
was
very
young
and
very
ignorant
but
john
perhaps
would
endeavour
to
win
me
over
by
kindness
and
make
my
lot
less
wretched
above
all
he
might
enlighten
me
as
to
my
true
position
by
explaining
that
i
was
an
outcast
from
society
and
could
not
return
to
it
without
being
hanged
immediately
then
perhaps
my
obstinacy
and
pride
would
give
way
out
of
regard
to
my
own
on
the
one
hand
and
from
necessity
on
the
other
at
all
events
they
should
try
this
before
getting
rid
of
me
for
said
antony
to
round
off
his
homily
we
were
ten
mauprats
last
year
our
father
is
dead
and
if
we
kill
bernard
we
shall
only
be
this
argument
gained
the
day
they
brought
me
forth
from
the
species
of
dungeon
in
which
i
had
languished
for
several
months
they
gave
me
new
clothes
they
exchanged
my
old
gun
for
a
beautiful
carbine
that
i
had
always
coveted
they
explained
to
me
my
position
in
the
world
they
honoured
me
with
the
best
wine
at
meals
i
promised
to
reflect
and
meanwhile
became
rather
more
brutalized
by
inaction
and
drunkenness
than
i
had
been
by
brigandage
however
my
captivity
had
made
such
a
terrible
impression
on
me
that
i
took
a
secret
oath
to
dare
any
dangers
that
might
assail
me
on
the
territories
of
the
king
of
france
rather
than
endure
a
repetition
of
that
hideous
experience
nothing
but
a
miserable
point
of
honour
now
kept
me
at
it
was
evident
that
a
storm
was
gathering
over
our
heads
the
peasants
were
discontented
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
to
attach
them
to
us
doctrines
of
independence
were
secretly
insinuating
themselves
into
their
midst
our
most
faithful
retainers
were
growing
tired
of
merely
having
their
fill
of
bread
and
meat
they
were
demanding
money
and
we
had
none
we
had
received
more
than
one
serious
summons
to
pay
our
fiscal
dues
to
the
state
and
as
our
private
creditors
had
joined
hands
with
the
crown
officers
and
the
recalcitrant
peasants
everything
was
threatening
us
with
a
catastrophe
like
that
which
had
just
overtaken
the
seigneur
de
pleumartin
in
our
province
the
reputation
which
the
seigneur
de
pleumartin
has
left
behind
him
in
the
province
will
preserve
the
story
of
mauprat
from
the
reproach
of
exaggeration
pen
would
refuse
to
trace
the
savage
obscenities
and
refinements
of
cruelty
which
marked
the
life
of
this
madman
and
which
perpetuated
the
traditions
of
feudal
brigandage
in
berry
down
to
the
last
days
of
the
ancient
monarchy
his
chateau
was
besieged
and
after
a
stubborn
resistance
he
was
taken
and
hanged
there
are
many
people
still
living
nor
yet
very
advanced
in
years
who
knew
the
man
my
uncles
had
long
thought
of
making
common
cause
with
this
country
squire
in
his
marauding
expeditions
and
his
resistance
to
authority
however
just
as
pleumartin
about
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
had
given
his
word
of
honour
that
he
would
welcome
us
as
friends
and
allies
if
we
went
to
his
assistance
we
had
heard
of
his
defeat
and
tragic
end
thus
we
ourselves
were
now
on
our
guard
night
and
day
it
was
a
question
of
either
fleeing
the
country
or
bracing
ourselves
for
a
decisive
struggle
some
counselled
the
former
alternative
the
others
declared
their
resolve
to
follow
the
advice
of
their
dying
father
and
to
find
a
grave
under
the
ruins
of
the
keep
any
suggestion
of
flight
or
compromise
they
denounced
as
contemptible
cowardice
the
fear
then
of
incurring
such
a
reproach
and
perhaps
in
some
measure
an
instinctive
love
of
danger
still
kept
me
back
however
my
aversion
to
this
odious
existence
was
only
lying
dormant
ready
to
break
out
violently
at
any
moment
one
evening
after
a
heavy
supper
we
remained
at
table
drinking
and
conversing
god
knows
in
what
words
and
on
what
subject
it
was
frightful
weather
the
rain
driven
through
the
broken
windows
was
running
in
streams
across
the
stone
floor
of
the
hall
and
the
old
walls
were
trembling
in
the
storm
the
night
wind
was
whistling
through
chinks
in
the
roof
and
making
the
flames
of
our
resin
torches
flicker
weirdly
during
the
meal
my
uncles
had
rallied
me
very
much
on
what
they
called
my
virtue
they
had
treated
my
shyness
in
the
presence
of
women
as
a
sign
of
continence
and
it
was
especially
in
this
matter
that
they
urged
me
to
evil
by
ridiculing
my
modesty
while
parrying
these
coarse
gibes
and
making
thrusts
in
the
same
strain
i
had
been
drinking
enormously
consequently
my
wild
imagination
had
become
inflamed
and
i
boasted
that
i
would
be
bolder
and
more
successful
with
the
first
woman
brought
to
than
any
of
my
uncles
the
challenge
was
accepted
amid
roars
of
laughter
peals
of
thunder
sent
back
an
answer
to
the
infernal
merriment
all
at
once
the
horn
was
heard
at
the
portcullis
everybody
stopped
talking
the
blast
just
blown
was
the
signal
used
by
the
mauprats
to
summon
each
other
or
make
themselves
known
it
was
my
uncle
laurence
who
had
been
absent
all
day
and
who
was
now
asking
to
be
let
in
we
had
so
little
confidence
in
others
that
we
acted
as
our
own
turnkeys
in
the
fortress
john
rose
and
took
down
the
keys
but
he
stopped
immediately
on
hearing
a
second
blast
of
the
horn
this
meant
that
laurence
was
bringing
in
a
prize
and
that
we
were
to
go
and
meet
him
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
all
the
mauprats
were
at
the
portcullis
torch
in
hand
except
myself
whose
indifference
at
this
moment
was
profound
and
whose
legs
were
seriously
conscious
of
wine
if
it
is
a
woman
cried
antony
as
he
went
out
i
swear
by
the
soul
of
my
father
that
she
shall
be
handed
over
to
you
my
valiant
young
man
and
we
ll
see
if
your
courage
comes
up
to
your
i
remained
with
my
elbows
on
the
table
sunk
in
an
uncomfortable
stupor
when
the
door
opened
again
i
saw
a
woman
in
a
strange
costume
entering
with
a
confident
step
it
required
an
effort
to
keep
my
mind
from
wandering
and
to
grasp
what
one
of
the
mauprats
came
and
whispered
to
me
in
the
middle
of
a
at
which
several
of
the
nobles
in
the
neighbourhood
had
been
present
with
their
wives
this
young
lady
s
horse
had
taken
fright
and
bolted
away
from
the
rest
of
the
field
when
it
had
pulled
up
after
a
gallop
of
about
a
league
she
had
tried
to
find
her
way
back
but
not
knowing
the
varenne
district
where
all
the
landmarks
are
so
much
alike
she
had
gone
farther
and
farther
astray
the
storm
and
the
advent
of
night
had
completed
her
perplexity
laurence
happening
to
meet
her
had
offered
to
escort
her
to
the
chateau
of
rochemaure
which
as
a
fact
was
more
than
six
leagues
distant
but
he
had
declared
that
it
was
quite
near
and
had
pretended
to
be
the
gamekeeper
there
she
did
not
actually
know
the
lady
of
rochemaure
but
being
a
distant
connection
of
hers
she
counted
upon
a
welcome
never
having
seen
the
face
of
a
single
mauprat
and
little
dreaming
that
she
was
so
near
their
haunt
she
had
followed
her
guide
confidingly
and
as
she
had
never
in
her
life
caught
a
glimpse
of
whether
in
the
distance
or
close
at
hand
she
was
led
upon
the
scene
of
our
orgies
without
having
the
least
suspicion
of
the
trap
into
which
she
had
fallen
when
i
rubbed
my
heavy
eyes
and
beheld
this
woman
so
young
and
so
beautiful
with
her
expression
of
calm
sincerity
and
of
goodness
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
seen
on
the
brow
of
any
other
for
all
those
who
had
passed
the
portcullis
of
our
abode
were
either
insolent
prostitutes
or
stupid
victims
i
could
not
but
think
i
was
dreaming
remembering
how
prominently
fairies
figured
in
my
legends
of
chivalry
i
almost
fancied
that
morgana
or
urganda
had
come
among
us
to
administer
justice
and
for
the
moment
i
felt
an
inclination
to
throw
myself
on
my
knees
and
protest
against
any
judgment
which
should
confound
me
with
my
uncles
antony
to
whom
laurence
had
quickly
given
the
cue
approached
her
with
as
much
politeness
as
he
had
in
his
composition
and
begged
her
to
excuse
his
hunting
costume
likewise
that
of
his
friends
they
were
all
nephews
or
cousins
of
the
lady
of
rochemaure
whom
they
were
now
awaiting
before
sitting
down
to
table
being
very
religious
she
was
at
present
in
the
chapel
in
pious
conference
with
the
chaplain
the
air
of
simple
confidence
with
which
the
stranger
listened
to
these
absurd
lies
went
to
my
heart
but
i
had
not
a
very
clear
idea
of
what
i
felt
please
she
said
to
my
uncle
john
who
was
dancing
attendance
on
her
with
the
leer
of
a
satyr
please
do
not
let
me
disturb
this
lady
i
am
so
troubled
about
the
anxiety
i
must
be
causing
my
father
and
my
friends
at
the
present
moment
that
i
could
not
really
stop
here
all
i
ask
is
that
she
will
be
kind
enough
to
lend
me
a
fresh
horse
and
a
guide
so
that
i
may
return
to
the
place
where
i
presume
my
people
may
have
gone
to
wait
for
madame
replied
john
with
assurance
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
start
again
in
such
weather
as
this
besides
if
you
did
that
would
only
serve
to
delay
the
hour
of
rejoining
those
who
are
looking
for
you
ten
of
our
men
well
mounted
and
provided
with
torches
shall
set
out
this
very
moment
in
ten
different
directions
and
scour
every
corner
of
varenne
thus
in
two
hours
at
the
most
your
relatives
will
be
certain
to
have
news
of
you
and
you
will
soon
see
them
arriving
here
where
we
will
entertain
them
as
best
we
can
please
then
set
your
mind
at
rest
and
take
some
cordial
to
restore
you
for
you
must
be
wet
through
and
quite
were
it
not
for
the
anxiety
i
feel
she
answered
with
a
smile
i
should
be
famished
i
will
try
to
eat
something
but
do
not
put
yourselves
to
any
inconvenience
on
my
account
you
have
been
far
too
good
approaching
the
table
where
i
was
still
resting
on
my
elbows
she
took
some
fruit
that
was
by
my
side
without
noticing
me
i
turned
and
stared
at
her
insolently
with
a
besotted
expression
she
returned
my
gaze
haughtily
at
least
so
it
appeared
to
me
then
i
have
since
learned
that
she
did
not
even
see
me
for
while
making
a
great
effort
to
appear
calm
and
to
reply
with
an
air
of
confidence
to
the
offers
of
hospitality
she
was
at
heart
very
much
disturbed
by
the
unexpected
presence
of
so
many
strange
men
with
their
forbidding
mien
and
rough
garb
however
she
did
not
suspect
anything
i
overheard
one
of
the
mauprats
near
me
saying
to
john
good
it
s
all
right
she
is
falling
into
the
trap
let
us
make
her
drink
then
she
will
begin
to
one
moment
replied
john
watch
her
carefully
this
is
a
serious
matter
there
is
something
better
to
be
had
out
of
this
than
a
little
passing
pleasure
i
am
going
to
talk
it
over
with
the
others
you
will
be
sent
for
to
give
your
opinion
meanwhile
keep
an
eye
on
what
is
the
matter
i
said
abruptly
as
i
faced
him
does
not
this
girl
belong
to
me
did
not
antony
swear
it
by
the
soul
of
my
grandfather
yes
confound
it
that
s
true
said
antony
approaching
our
group
whilst
the
other
mauprats
surrounded
the
lady
listen
bernard
i
will
keep
my
word
on
one
what
is
that
it
is
quite
simple
that
you
won
t
within
the
next
ten
minutes
tell
this
wench
that
she
is
not
at
old
rochemaure
what
do
you
take
me
for
i
answered
pulling
my
hat
over
my
eyes
do
you
think
that
i
am
an
idiot
wait
a
minute
would
you
like
me
to
go
and
get
my
grandmother
s
dress
which
is
upstairs
and
pass
myself
off
for
this
same
lady
of
rochemaure
a
splendid
idea
replied
laurence
but
before
anything
is
done
said
john
i
want
to
speak
to
you
and
making
signs
to
the
others
he
drew
them
out
of
the
hall
just
as
they
were
going
out
i
thought
i
noticed
that
john
was
trying
to
persuade
antony
to
keep
watch
over
me
but
antony
with
a
firmness
which
i
could
not
understand
insisted
on
following
the
rest
i
was
left
alone
with
the
stranger
for
a
moment
i
remained
bewildered
almost
stupefied
and
more
embarrassed
than
pleased
at
the
then
i
endeavoured
to
think
of
some
explanation
of
these
mysterious
things
that
were
happening
around
me
and
succeeded
as
far
as
the
fumes
of
the
wine
would
allow
me
in
imagining
something
fairly
probable
though
indeed
remote
enough
from
the
actual
truth
i
thought
i
could
account
for
everything
i
had
just
seen
and
heard
by
supposing
first
that
the
lady
quiet
and
richly
dressed
though
she
was
was
one
of
those
daughters
of
bohemia
that
i
had
sometimes
seen
at
fairs
secondly
that
laurence
having
met
her
in
the
country
had
brought
her
here
to
amuse
the
company
and
thirdly
that
they
had
told
her
of
my
condition
of
swaggering
drunkenness
and
had
prevailed
on
her
to
put
my
gallantry
to
the
proof
whilst
they
were
to
watch
me
through
the
keyhole
my
first
movement
as
soon
as
these
ideas
had
taken
possession
of
me
was
to
rise
and
go
straight
to
the
door
this
i
locked
with
a
double
turn
and
then
bolted
when
i
had
done
this
i
returned
to
the
lady
determined
that
i
would
not
at
all
events
give
her
cause
to
laugh
at
my
bashfulness
she
was
sitting
close
to
the
fire
and
as
she
was
occupied
in
drying
her
wet
garments
leaning
forward
over
the
hearth
she
had
not
taken
any
notice
of
what
i
was
doing
but
when
i
approached
her
the
strange
expression
on
my
face
caused
her
to
start
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
kiss
her
as
a
beginning
but
i
know
not
by
what
miracle
as
soon
as
she
raised
her
eyes
to
mine
this
familiarity
became
impossible
i
only
had
sufficient
courage
to
say
upon
my
word
mademoiselle
you
are
a
charming
creature
and
i
love
you
as
true
as
my
name
is
bernard
bernard
mauprat
she
cried
springing
up
you
are
bernard
mauprat
you
in
that
case
change
your
manner
and
learn
to
whom
you
are
talking
have
they
not
told
you
no
one
has
told
me
but
i
can
guess
i
replied
with
a
grin
while
trying
hard
to
trample
down
the
feeling
of
respect
with
which
her
sudden
pallor
and
imperious
attitude
inspired
me
if
you
can
guess
she
said
how
is
it
possible
that
you
allow
yourself
to
speak
to
me
in
this
way
but
they
were
right
when
they
said
you
were
and
yet
i
always
had
a
wish
to
meet
really
i
said
with
the
same
hideous
grin
you
a
princess
of
the
king
s
highway
who
have
known
so
many
men
in
your
life
but
let
my
lips
meet
your
own
my
sweet
and
you
shall
see
if
i
am
not
as
nicely
mannered
as
those
uncles
of
mine
whom
you
were
listening
to
so
willingly
just
your
uncles
she
cried
suddenly
seizing
her
chair
and
placing
it
between
us
as
if
from
some
instinct
of
oh
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
then
i
am
not
at
madame
de
rochemaure
s
our
name
certainly
begins
in
the
same
way
and
we
come
of
as
good
a
rock
as
she
muttered
trembling
from
head
to
foot
like
a
hind
when
it
hears
the
howl
of
wolves
and
her
lips
grew
quite
white
her
agony
was
manifest
in
every
gesture
from
an
involuntary
feeling
of
sympathy
i
shuddered
myself
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
changing
my
manner
and
language
forthwith
what
can
there
be
in
this
to
astound
her
so
i
asked
myself
is
she
not
merely
acting
a
part
and
even
if
the
mauprats
are
not
hidden
behind
some
wainscot
listening
to
us
is
she
not
sure
to
give
them
an
account
of
everything
that
takes
place
and
yet
she
is
trembling
like
an
aspen
leaf
but
what
if
she
is
acting
i
once
saw
an
actress
play
genevieve
de
brabant
and
she
wept
so
that
one
might
have
been
i
was
in
a
state
of
great
perplexity
and
i
cast
harassed
glances
now
at
her
now
at
the
doors
which
i
fancied
every
moment
would
be
thrown
wide
open
amid
roars
of
laughter
from
my
uncles
this
woman
was
beautiful
as
the
day
i
do
not
believe
there
has
ever
lived
a
woman
as
lovely
as
she
it
is
not
i
alone
who
say
so
she
has
left
a
reputation
for
beauty
which
has
not
yet
died
out
in
her
province
she
was
rather
tall
slender
and
remarkable
for
the
easy
grace
of
her
movements
her
complexion
was
very
fair
while
her
eyes
were
dark
and
her
hair
like
ebony
her
glance
and
her
smile
showed
a
union
of
goodness
and
acuteness
which
it
was
almost
impossible
to
conceive
it
was
as
if
heaven
had
given
her
two
souls
one
wholly
of
intellect
the
other
wholly
of
feeling
she
was
naturally
cheerful
and
brave
an
angel
indeed
whom
the
sorrows
of
humanity
had
not
yet
dared
to
touch
she
knew
not
what
it
was
to
suffer
she
knew
not
what
it
was
to
distrust
and
dread
this
indeed
was
the
first
trial
of
her
life
and
it
was
i
brute
that
i
was
who
made
her
undergo
it
i
took
her
for
a
gipsy
and
she
was
an
angel
of
purity
she
was
my
young
cousin
or
aunt
after
the
breton
fashion
edmee
de
mauprat
the
daughter
of
hubert
my
again
in
the
breton
fashion
known
as
the
chevalier
he
who
had
sought
release
from
the
order
of
malta
that
he
might
marry
though
already
somewhat
advanced
in
years
my
cousin
was
the
same
age
as
myself
at
least
there
was
a
difference
of
only
a
few
months
between
us
both
of
us
were
now
seventeen
and
this
was
our
first
interview
she
whom
i
ought
to
have
protected
at
the
peril
of
my
life
against
the
world
was
now
standing
before
me
trembling
and
like
a
victim
before
the
executioner
she
made
a
great
effort
and
approaching
me
as
i
walked
about
the
hall
deep
in
thought
she
explained
who
she
was
adding
it
is
impossible
that
you
can
be
an
infamous
creature
like
all
these
brigands
whom
i
have
just
seen
and
of
whose
hideous
life
i
have
often
heard
you
are
young
your
mother
was
good
and
wise
my
father
wanted
to
adopt
you
and
bring
you
up
as
his
son
even
he
is
still
full
of
grief
at
not
being
able
to
draw
you
out
of
the
abyss
in
which
you
lie
have
you
not
often
received
messages
from
him
bernard
you
and
i
are
of
the
same
family
think
of
the
ties
of
blood
why
would
you
insult
me
do
they
intend
to
assassinate
me
here
or
torture
me
why
did
they
deceive
me
by
saying
that
i
was
at
rochemaure
why
did
they
withdraw
in
this
mysterious
way
what
are
they
preparing
what
is
going
to
happen
her
words
were
cut
short
by
the
report
of
a
gun
outside
a
shot
from
the
culverin
replied
to
it
and
the
alarm
trumpet
shook
the
gloomy
walls
of
the
keep
with
its
dismal
note
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
fell
back
into
her
chair
i
remained
where
i
was
wondering
whether
this
was
some
new
scene
in
the
comedy
they
were
enjoying
at
my
expense
however
i
resolved
not
to
let
the
alarm
cause
me
any
uneasiness
until
i
had
certain
proof
that
it
was
not
a
trick
come
now
i
said
going
up
to
her
again
own
that
all
this
is
a
joke
you
are
not
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
at
all
and
you
merely
want
to
discover
if
i
am
an
apprentice
capable
of
making
i
swear
by
christ
she
answered
taking
my
hands
in
her
own
which
were
cold
as
death
that
i
am
edmee
your
cousin
your
prisoner
yes
and
your
friend
for
i
have
always
felt
an
interest
in
you
i
have
always
implored
my
father
not
to
cease
his
efforts
for
you
but
listen
bernard
they
are
fighting
and
fighting
with
guns
it
must
be
my
father
who
has
come
to
look
for
me
and
they
are
going
to
kill
him
ah
she
cried
falling
on
her
knees
before
me
go
and
prevent
that
bernard
tell
your
uncles
to
respect
my
father
the
best
of
men
if
you
but
knew
tell
them
that
if
they
hate
our
family
if
they
must
have
blood
they
may
kill
me
let
them
tear
my
heart
out
but
let
them
respect
my
father
some
one
outside
called
me
in
a
violent
voice
where
is
the
coward
where
is
that
wretched
boy
shouted
my
uncle
laurence
then
he
shook
the
door
but
i
had
fastened
it
so
securely
that
it
resisted
all
his
furious
blows
that
miserable
cur
is
amusing
himself
by
making
love
while
our
throats
are
being
cut
bernard
the
mounted
police
are
attacking
us
your
uncle
louis
had
just
been
killed
come
and
help
us
for
god
s
sake
come
bernard
may
the
devil
take
the
lot
of
you
i
cried
and
may
you
be
killed
yourself
if
i
believe
a
single
word
of
all
this
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
you
imagine
the
only
cowards
here
are
those
who
lie
didn
t
i
swear
that
the
woman
should
be
mine
i
m
not
going
to
give
her
up
until
i
to
hell
with
you
replied
laurence
you
are
pretending
the
shots
rang
out
faster
frightful
cries
were
heard
laurence
left
the
door
and
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
his
eagerness
proved
him
so
much
in
earnest
that
i
could
no
longer
refuse
to
believe
him
the
thought
that
they
would
accuse
me
of
cowardice
overcame
me
i
advanced
towards
the
door
o
bernard
o
monsieur
de
mauprat
cried
edmee
staggering
after
me
let
me
go
with
you
i
will
throw
myself
at
your
uncles
feet
i
will
make
them
stop
the
fight
i
will
give
them
all
i
possess
my
life
if
they
wish
if
only
they
will
spare
my
wait
a
moment
i
said
turning
towards
her
i
am
by
no
means
certain
that
this
is
not
a
joke
at
my
expense
i
have
a
suspicion
that
my
uncles
are
there
behind
that
door
and
that
while
our
are
firing
off
guns
in
the
courtyard
they
are
waiting
with
a
blanket
to
toss
me
now
either
you
are
my
cousin
or
you
are
a
you
must
make
me
a
solemn
promise
and
i
will
make
you
one
in
return
if
you
are
one
of
these
wandering
charmers
and
i
quit
this
room
the
dupe
of
your
pretty
acting
you
must
swear
to
be
my
mistress
and
to
allow
none
other
near
you
until
i
have
had
my
rights
otherwise
for
my
part
i
swear
that
you
shall
be
chastised
even
as
my
spotted
dog
flora
was
chastised
this
morning
if
on
the
other
hand
you
are
edmee
and
i
swear
to
intervene
between
your
father
and
those
who
would
kill
him
what
promise
will
you
make
me
what
will
you
swear
if
you
save
my
father
she
cried
i
swear
to
you
that
i
will
marry
you
i
swear
ho
ho
indeed
i
said
emboldened
by
her
enthusiasm
the
sublimity
of
which
i
did
not
understand
give
me
a
pledge
then
so
that
in
any
case
i
do
not
go
out
from
here
like
a
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
kissed
her
she
did
not
attempt
to
resist
her
cheeks
were
like
ice
mechanically
she
began
to
follow
me
as
i
moved
to
the
door
i
was
obliged
to
push
her
back
i
did
so
without
roughness
but
she
fell
as
one
in
a
faint
i
began
to
grasp
the
gravity
of
my
position
for
there
was
nobody
in
the
corridor
and
the
tumult
outside
was
becoming
more
and
more
alarming
i
was
about
to
run
and
get
my
weapons
when
a
last
feeling
of
distrust
or
it
may
have
been
another
sentiment
prompted
me
to
go
back
and
the
door
of
the
hall
where
i
was
leaving
edmee
i
put
the
key
into
my
belt
and
hastened
to
the
ramparts
armed
with
a
gun
which
i
loaded
as
i
ran
it
was
simply
an
attack
made
by
the
mounted
police
and
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
a
little
while
before
our
creditors
had
obtained
a
writ
of
arrest
against
us
the
law
officers
beaten
and
otherwise
severely
handled
had
demanded
of
the
king
s
advocate
at
the
provincial
court
of
bourges
another
warrant
of
arrest
this
the
armed
police
were
now
doing
their
best
to
execute
they
had
hoped
to
effect
an
easy
capture
by
means
of
a
night
surprise
but
we
were
in
a
better
state
of
defence
than
they
had
anticipated
our
men
were
brave
and
well
armed
and
then
we
were
fighting
for
our
very
existence
we
had
the
courage
of
despair
and
this
was
an
immense
advantage
our
band
amounted
to
all
told
theirs
to
more
than
fifty
soldiers
in
addition
to
a
score
or
more
of
peasants
who
were
slinging
stones
from
the
flanks
these
however
did
more
harm
to
their
allies
than
they
did
to
us
for
half
an
hour
the
fighting
was
most
desperate
at
the
end
of
this
time
the
enemy
had
become
so
dismayed
by
our
resistance
that
they
fell
back
and
hostilities
were
suspended
however
they
soon
returned
to
the
attack
and
again
were
repulsed
with
loss
hostilities
were
once
more
suspended
they
then
for
the
third
time
called
upon
us
to
surrender
promising
that
our
lives
should
be
spared
antony
mauprat
replied
with
an
obscene
jest
they
remained
undecided
but
did
not
withdraw
i
had
fought
bravely
i
had
done
what
i
called
my
duty
there
was
a
long
lull
it
was
impossible
to
judge
the
distance
of
the
enemy
and
we
dared
not
fire
at
random
into
the
darkness
for
our
ammunition
was
too
precious
all
my
uncles
remained
riveted
on
the
ramparts
in
case
of
fresh
attack
my
uncle
louis
was
dangerously
wounded
thoughts
of
my
prisoner
returned
to
my
mind
at
the
beginning
of
the
fight
i
had
heard
john
mauprat
saying
that
if
our
defeat
seemed
imminent
we
must
offer
to
hand
her
over
to
the
enemy
on
condition
that
they
should
raise
the
seige
that
if
they
refused
we
must
hang
her
before
their
eyes
i
had
no
longer
any
doubts
about
the
truth
of
what
she
had
told
me
when
victory
appeared
to
declare
for
us
they
forgot
the
captive
but
i
noticed
the
crafty
john
quitting
the
culverin
which
he
so
loved
to
fire
and
creeping
away
like
a
cat
into
the
darkness
a
feeling
of
ungovernable
jealousy
seized
me
i
threw
down
my
gun
and
dashed
after
him
knife
in
hand
resolved
i
believe
to
stab
him
if
he
attempted
to
touch
what
i
considered
my
booty
i
saw
him
approach
the
door
try
to
open
it
peer
attentively
through
the
keyhole
to
assure
himself
that
his
prey
had
not
escaped
him
suddenly
shots
were
heard
again
he
sprang
to
his
maimed
feet
with
that
marvellous
agility
of
his
and
limped
off
to
the
ramparts
for
myself
hidden
as
i
was
by
the
darkness
i
let
him
pass
and
did
not
follow
a
passion
other
than
the
love
of
slaughter
had
just
taken
possession
of
me
a
flash
of
jealousy
had
fired
my
senses
the
smell
of
powder
the
sight
of
blood
the
noise
the
danger
and
the
many
bumpers
of
brandy
we
had
passed
round
to
keep
up
our
strength
had
strangely
heated
my
brain
i
took
the
key
from
my
belt
and
opened
the
door
noisily
and
now
as
i
stood
before
my
captive
again
i
was
no
longer
the
suspicious
and
clumsy
novice
she
had
so
easily
moved
to
pity
i
was
the
wild
outlaw
of
a
hundred
times
more
dangerous
than
at
first
she
rushed
towards
me
eagerly
i
opened
my
arms
to
catch
her
instead
of
being
frightened
she
threw
herself
into
them
exclaiming
well
and
my
father
your
father
i
said
kissing
her
is
not
there
at
the
present
moment
there
is
no
question
either
of
him
or
of
you
we
have
brought
down
a
dozen
gendarmes
that
is
all
victory
as
usual
is
declaring
for
us
so
don
t
trouble
yourself
any
more
about
your
father
and
i
i
won
t
trouble
myself
further
about
the
king
s
men
let
us
live
in
peace
and
rejoice
in
with
these
words
i
raised
to
my
lips
a
goblet
of
wine
which
had
been
left
on
the
table
but
she
took
it
out
of
my
hands
with
an
air
of
authority
that
made
me
all
the
bolder
don
t
drink
any
more
she
said
think
seriously
of
what
you
are
saying
is
what
you
tell
me
true
will
you
answer
for
it
on
your
honour
on
the
soul
of
your
mother
every
word
is
true
i
swear
it
by
your
pretty
rosy
lips
i
replied
trying
to
kiss
her
again
but
she
drew
back
in
terror
oh
mon
dieu
she
exclaimed
he
is
drunk
bernard
bernard
remember
what
you
promised
do
not
break
your
word
you
have
not
forgotten
have
you
that
i
am
your
kinswoman
your
sister
you
are
my
mistress
or
my
wife
i
answered
still
pursuing
her
you
are
a
contemptible
creature
she
rejoined
repulsing
me
with
her
riding
whip
what
have
you
done
that
i
should
be
aught
to
you
have
you
helped
my
father
i
swore
to
help
him
and
i
would
have
helped
him
if
he
had
been
there
it
is
just
the
same
therefore
as
if
i
really
had
but
had
he
been
there
and
had
i
tried
to
save
him
and
failed
do
you
know
that
for
this
treachery
could
not
have
provided
any
instrument
of
torture
cruel
enough
and
slow
enough
to
drag
the
life
out
of
me
inch
by
inch
for
all
i
know
they
may
actually
have
heard
my
vow
i
proclaimed
it
loudly
enough
but
what
do
i
care
i
set
little
store
by
a
couple
of
days
more
or
less
of
life
but
i
do
set
some
store
by
your
favour
my
beauty
i
don
t
want
to
be
the
languishing
knight
that
every
one
laughs
at
come
now
love
me
at
once
or
my
word
i
will
return
to
the
fight
and
if
i
am
killed
so
much
the
worse
for
you
you
will
no
longer
have
a
knight
to
help
you
and
you
will
still
have
seven
mauprats
to
keep
at
bay
i
m
afraid
you
are
not
strong
enough
for
that
rough
work
my
pretty
little
these
words
which
i
threw
out
at
random
merely
to
distract
her
attention
so
that
i
might
seize
her
hands
or
her
waist
made
a
deep
impression
on
her
she
fled
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall
and
tried
to
force
open
the
window
but
her
little
hands
could
not
even
move
the
heavy
leaden
sash
in
the
rusty
ironwork
her
efforts
made
me
laugh
she
clasped
her
hands
in
terror
and
remained
motionless
then
all
at
once
the
expression
of
her
face
changed
she
seemed
to
have
resolved
how
to
act
and
came
toward
me
smiling
and
with
outstretched
hand
so
beautiful
was
she
thus
that
a
mist
came
over
my
eyes
and
for
a
moment
i
saw
her
not
ah
gentlemen
forgive
my
childishness
i
must
tell
you
how
she
was
dressed
after
that
weird
night
she
never
wore
that
costume
again
and
yet
i
can
remember
it
so
exactly
it
is
a
long
long
time
ago
but
were
i
to
live
as
long
as
i
have
already
lived
again
i
should
not
forget
a
single
detail
so
much
was
i
struck
by
it
amid
the
tumult
that
was
raging
within
me
and
without
amid
the
din
of
shots
striking
the
ramparts
the
lightning
flashes
ripping
the
sky
and
the
violent
palpitations
which
sent
my
blood
surging
from
my
heart
to
my
brain
and
from
my
head
to
my
breast
oh
how
lovely
she
was
it
seems
as
if
her
shade
were
even
now
passing
before
my
eyes
yes
i
fancy
i
see
her
in
the
same
dress
the
which
used
to
be
worn
in
those
days
the
skirt
of
it
was
of
cloth
and
very
full
round
the
waist
was
a
red
sash
while
a
waistcoat
of
satin
fastened
with
buttons
fitted
closely
to
the
figure
over
this
was
a
trimmed
with
lace
short
and
open
in
front
the
hat
of
gray
felt
with
a
broad
brim
turned
up
in
front
was
crowned
with
half
a
dozen
red
feathers
the
hair
which
was
not
powdered
was
drawn
back
from
the
face
and
fell
down
in
two
long
plaits
like
those
of
the
bernese
women
edmee
s
were
so
long
that
they
almost
reached
the
ground
her
garb
to
me
so
strangely
fascinating
her
youth
and
beauty
and
the
favour
with
which
she
now
seemed
to
regard
my
pretensions
combined
to
make
me
mad
with
love
and
joy
i
could
imagine
nothing
more
beautiful
than
a
lovely
woman
yielding
without
coarse
words
and
without
tears
of
shame
my
first
impulse
was
to
take
her
in
my
arms
but
as
if
overcome
by
that
irresistible
longing
to
worship
which
characterizes
a
first
love
even
with
the
grossest
of
beings
i
fell
down
before
her
and
pressed
her
knees
to
my
breast
and
yet
on
my
own
supposition
it
was
to
a
shameless
wanton
that
this
homage
was
paid
i
was
none
the
less
nigh
to
swooning
from
bliss
she
took
my
head
between
her
two
beautiful
hands
and
exclaimed
ah
i
was
right
i
knew
quite
well
that
you
were
not
one
of
those
reprobates
you
are
going
to
save
me
aren
t
you
thank
god
how
i
thank
you
o
god
must
we
jump
from
the
window
oh
i
am
not
afraid
come
come
i
seemed
as
if
awakened
from
a
dream
and
i
confess
the
awakening
was
not
a
little
painful
what
does
this
mean
i
asked
as
i
rose
to
my
feet
are
you
still
jesting
with
me
do
you
not
know
where
you
are
do
you
think
that
i
am
a
child
i
know
that
i
am
at
she
replied
turning
pale
again
and
that
i
shall
be
outraged
and
assassinated
in
a
couple
of
hours
if
meanwhile
i
do
not
succeed
in
inspiring
you
with
some
pity
but
i
shall
succeed
she
cried
falling
at
my
feet
in
her
turn
you
are
not
one
of
those
men
you
are
too
young
to
be
a
monster
like
them
i
could
see
from
your
eyes
that
you
pitied
me
you
will
help
me
to
escape
won
t
you
won
t
you
my
dear
heart
she
took
my
hands
and
kissed
them
frenziedly
in
the
hope
of
moving
me
i
listened
and
looked
at
her
with
a
sullen
stupidity
scarcely
calculated
to
reassure
her
my
heart
was
naturally
but
little
accessible
to
feelings
of
generosity
and
compassion
and
at
this
moment
a
passion
stronger
than
all
the
rest
was
keeping
down
the
impulse
she
had
striven
to
arouse
i
devoured
her
with
my
eyes
and
made
no
effort
to
understand
her
words
i
only
wished
to
discover
whether
i
was
pleasing
to
her
or
whether
she
was
trying
to
make
use
of
me
to
effect
her
escape
i
see
that
you
are
afraid
i
said
you
are
wrong
to
be
afraid
of
me
i
shall
certainly
not
do
you
any
harm
you
are
too
pretty
for
me
to
think
of
anything
but
of
caressing
yes
but
your
uncles
will
kill
me
she
cried
you
know
they
will
surely
you
would
not
have
me
killed
since
you
love
me
save
me
i
will
love
you
oh
yes
afterwards
afterwards
i
answered
laughing
with
a
silly
unbelieving
air
after
you
have
had
me
hanged
by
those
gendarmes
to
whom
i
have
just
given
such
a
drubbing
come
now
prove
that
you
love
me
at
once
i
will
save
you
afterwards
you
see
i
can
talk
about
afterwards
i
pursued
her
round
the
room
though
she
fled
from
me
she
gave
no
signs
of
anger
and
still
appealed
to
me
with
soft
words
in
me
the
poor
girl
was
husbanding
her
one
hope
and
was
fearful
of
losing
it
ah
if
i
had
only
been
able
to
realize
what
such
a
woman
as
she
was
and
what
my
own
position
meant
but
i
was
unable
then
i
had
but
one
fixed
idea
the
idea
which
a
wolf
may
have
on
a
like
occasion
at
last
as
my
only
answer
to
all
her
entreaties
was
do
you
love
me
or
are
you
fooling
me
she
saw
what
a
brute
she
had
to
deal
with
and
making
up
her
mind
accordingly
she
came
towards
me
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
hid
her
face
in
my
bosom
and
let
me
kiss
her
hair
then
she
put
me
gently
from
her
saying
ah
mon
dieu
don
t
you
see
how
i
love
you
how
i
could
not
help
loving
you
from
the
very
first
moment
i
saw
you
but
don
t
you
understand
that
i
hate
your
uncles
and
that
i
would
be
yours
alone
yes
i
replied
obstinately
because
you
say
to
yourself
this
is
a
booby
whom
i
shall
persuade
to
do
anything
i
wish
by
telling
him
that
i
love
him
he
will
believe
it
and
i
will
take
him
away
to
be
come
there
is
only
one
word
which
will
serve
if
you
love
she
looked
at
me
with
an
agonized
air
i
sought
to
press
my
lips
to
hers
whenever
her
head
was
not
turned
away
i
held
her
hands
in
mine
she
was
powerless
now
to
do
more
than
delay
the
hour
of
her
defeat
suddenly
the
colour
rushed
back
to
the
pale
face
she
began
to
smile
and
with
an
expression
of
angelic
coquetry
she
asked
and
you
do
you
love
me
from
this
moment
the
victory
was
hers
i
no
longer
had
power
to
will
what
i
wished
the
lynx
in
me
was
subdued
the
man
rose
in
its
place
and
i
believe
that
my
voice
had
a
human
ring
as
i
cried
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
yes
i
love
you
yes
i
love
you
well
then
she
said
distractedly
and
in
a
caressing
tone
let
us
love
each
other
and
escape
yes
let
us
escape
i
answered
i
loathe
this
house
and
i
loathe
my
uncles
i
have
long
wanted
to
escape
and
yet
i
shall
only
be
hanged
you
they
won
t
hang
you
she
rejoined
with
a
laugh
my
betrothed
is
a
your
betrothed
i
cried
in
a
fresh
fit
of
jealousy
more
violent
than
the
first
you
are
going
to
be
married
and
why
not
she
replied
watching
me
attentively
i
turned
pale
and
clinched
my
teeth
in
that
case
i
said
trying
to
carry
her
off
in
my
arms
in
that
case
she
answered
giving
me
a
little
tap
on
the
cheek
i
see
that
you
are
jealous
but
his
must
be
a
particular
jealousy
who
at
ten
o
clock
yearns
for
his
mistress
only
to
hand
her
over
at
midnight
to
eight
drunken
men
who
will
return
her
to
him
on
the
morrow
as
foul
as
the
mud
on
the
ah
you
are
right
i
exclaimed
go
then
go
i
would
defend
you
to
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
but
i
should
be
vanquished
by
numbers
and
i
should
die
with
the
knowledge
that
you
were
left
to
them
how
horrible
i
shudder
to
think
of
it
come
you
must
yes
yes
my
angel
she
cried
kissing
me
passionately
on
the
cheek
these
caresses
the
first
a
woman
had
given
me
since
my
childhood
recalled
i
know
not
how
or
why
my
mother
s
last
kiss
and
instead
of
pleasure
caused
me
profound
sadness
i
felt
my
eyes
filling
with
tears
noticing
this
she
kissed
my
tears
repeating
the
while
save
me
save
me
and
your
marriage
i
asked
oh
listen
swear
that
you
will
not
marry
before
i
die
you
will
not
have
to
wait
long
for
my
uncles
administer
sound
justice
and
swift
as
they
you
are
not
going
to
follow
me
then
she
asked
follow
you
no
it
is
as
well
to
be
hanged
here
for
helping
you
to
escape
as
to
be
hanged
yonder
for
being
a
bandit
here
at
least
i
avoid
a
twofold
shame
i
shall
not
be
accounted
an
informer
and
shall
not
be
hanged
in
a
public
i
will
not
leave
you
here
she
cried
though
i
die
myself
fly
with
me
you
run
no
risk
believe
me
before
god
i
declare
you
are
safe
kill
me
if
i
lie
but
let
us
start
quickly
o
god
i
hear
them
singing
they
are
coming
this
way
ah
if
you
will
not
defend
me
kill
me
at
once
she
threw
herself
into
my
arms
love
and
jealousy
were
gradually
overpowering
me
indeed
i
even
thought
seriously
of
killing
her
and
i
kept
my
hand
on
my
as
long
as
i
heard
any
noise
or
voices
near
the
hall
they
were
exulting
in
their
victory
i
cursed
heaven
for
not
giving
it
to
our
foes
i
clasped
edmee
to
my
breast
and
we
remained
motionless
in
each
other
s
arms
until
a
fresh
report
announced
that
the
fight
was
beginning
again
then
i
pressed
her
passionately
to
my
heart
you
remind
me
i
said
of
a
poor
little
dove
which
one
day
flew
into
my
jacket
to
escape
from
a
kite
and
tried
to
hide
itself
in
my
and
you
did
not
give
it
up
to
the
kite
did
you
asked
edmee
no
by
all
the
devils
not
any
more
than
i
shall
give
you
up
you
the
prettiest
of
all
the
birds
in
the
woods
to
these
vile
that
are
threatening
but
how
shall
we
escape
she
cried
by
the
volleys
they
were
firing
easily
i
said
follow
i
seized
a
torch
and
lifting
a
i
made
her
descend
with
me
to
the
cellar
thence
we
passed
into
a
subterranean
passage
hollowed
out
of
the
rock
this
in
bygone
days
had
enabled
the
garrison
then
more
numerous
to
venture
upon
an
important
move
in
case
of
an
attack
some
of
the
besieged
would
emerge
into
the
open
country
on
the
side
opposite
the
portcullis
and
fall
on
the
rear
of
the
besiegers
who
were
thus
caught
between
two
fires
but
many
years
had
passed
since
the
garrison
of
was
large
enough
to
be
divided
into
two
bodies
and
besides
during
the
night
it
would
have
been
folly
to
venture
beyond
the
walls
we
arrived
therefore
at
the
exit
of
the
passage
without
meeting
with
any
obstacle
but
at
the
last
moment
i
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
madness
i
threw
down
my
torch
and
leaned
against
the
door
you
shall
not
go
out
from
here
i
said
to
the
trembling
edmee
without
promising
to
be
we
were
in
darkness
the
noise
of
the
fight
no
longer
reached
us
before
any
one
could
surprise
us
here
we
had
ample
time
to
escape
everything
was
in
my
favour
edmee
was
now
at
the
mercy
of
my
caprice
when
she
saw
that
the
seductions
of
her
beauty
could
no
longer
rouse
me
to
ecstasy
she
ceased
to
implore
and
drew
backward
a
few
steps
open
the
door
she
said
and
go
out
first
or
i
will
kill
myself
see
i
have
your
you
left
it
by
the
side
of
the
to
return
to
your
uncles
you
will
have
to
walk
through
my
her
resolute
manner
frightened
me
give
me
that
knife
i
said
or
be
the
consequences
what
they
may
i
will
take
it
from
you
by
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
to
die
she
said
calmly
if
this
knife
had
only
been
in
my
hand
yonder
in
the
chateau
i
should
not
have
humbled
myself
before
confound
it
i
cried
you
have
deceived
me
your
love
is
a
sham
begone
i
despise
you
i
will
not
follow
such
as
at
the
same
time
i
opened
the
door
i
would
not
go
without
you
she
cried
and
you
you
would
not
have
me
go
without
dishonour
which
of
us
is
the
more
generous
you
are
mad
i
said
you
have
lied
to
me
and
you
do
not
know
what
to
do
to
make
a
fool
of
me
however
you
shall
not
go
out
from
here
without
swearing
that
your
marriage
with
the
or
any
other
man
shall
not
take
place
before
you
have
been
my
your
mistress
she
said
are
you
dreaming
could
you
not
at
least
soften
the
insult
by
saying
your
wife
that
is
what
any
one
of
my
uncles
would
say
in
my
place
because
they
would
care
only
about
your
dowry
but
i
i
yearn
for
nothing
but
your
beauty
swear
then
that
you
will
be
mine
first
afterwards
you
shall
be
free
on
my
honour
and
if
my
jealousy
prove
so
fierce
that
it
may
not
be
borne
well
since
a
man
may
not
go
from
his
word
i
will
blow
my
brains
i
swear
said
edmee
to
be
no
man
s
before
being
that
is
not
it
swear
to
be
mine
before
being
any
other
it
is
the
same
thing
she
answered
yes
i
swear
on
the
gospel
on
the
name
of
christ
by
the
salvation
of
your
soul
by
the
memory
of
your
mother
on
the
gospel
in
the
name
of
christ
by
the
salvation
of
my
soul
by
the
memory
of
my
one
moment
she
rejoined
i
want
you
to
swear
that
my
promise
and
its
fulfilment
shall
remain
a
secret
that
my
father
shall
never
know
it
or
any
person
who
might
tell
no
one
in
the
world
shall
hear
it
from
me
why
should
i
want
others
to
know
provided
only
that
you
keep
your
word
she
made
me
repeat
the
formula
of
an
oath
then
we
hurried
forth
into
the
open
holding
each
other
s
hands
as
a
sign
of
mutual
trust
but
now
our
flight
became
dangerous
edmee
feared
the
besiegers
almost
as
much
as
the
besieged
we
were
fortunate
enough
not
to
meet
any
still
it
was
by
no
means
easy
to
move
quickly
the
night
was
so
dark
that
we
were
continually
running
against
trees
and
the
ground
was
so
slippery
that
we
were
unable
to
avoid
falls
a
sudden
noise
made
us
start
but
from
the
rattle
of
the
chain
fixed
on
its
foot
i
immediately
recognised
my
grandfather
s
horse
an
animal
of
an
extraordinary
age
but
still
strong
and
spirited
it
was
the
very
horse
that
had
brought
me
to
ten
years
before
at
present
the
only
thing
that
would
serve
as
a
bridle
was
the
rope
round
its
neck
i
passed
this
through
its
mouth
and
i
threw
my
jacket
over
the
crupper
and
helped
my
companion
to
mount
i
undid
the
chain
sprang
on
the
animal
s
back
and
urging
it
on
desperately
made
it
set
off
at
a
gallop
happen
what
might
luckily
for
us
it
knew
the
paths
better
than
i
and
as
if
by
instinct
followed
their
windings
without
knocking
against
any
trees
however
it
frequently
slipped
and
in
recovering
itself
gave
us
such
jolts
that
we
should
have
lost
our
seats
a
thousand
times
equipped
as
we
were
had
we
not
been
hanging
between
life
and
death
in
such
a
strait
desperate
ventures
are
best
and
god
protects
those
whom
man
pursues
we
were
congratulating
ourselves
on
being
out
of
danger
when
all
at
once
the
horse
struck
against
a
stump
and
catching
his
hoof
in
a
root
on
the
ground
fell
down
before
we
were
up
he
had
made
off
into
the
darkness
and
i
could
hear
him
galloping
farther
and
farther
away
as
we
fell
i
had
caught
edmee
in
my
arms
she
was
unhurt
my
own
ankle
however
was
sprained
so
severely
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
move
a
step
edmee
thought
that
my
leg
had
been
broken
i
was
inclined
to
think
so
myself
so
great
was
the
pain
but
soon
i
thought
no
further
either
of
my
agony
or
my
anxiety
edmee
s
tender
solicitude
made
me
forget
everything
it
was
in
vain
that
i
urged
her
to
continue
her
flight
without
me
i
pointed
out
that
she
could
now
escape
alone
that
we
were
some
distance
from
the
chateau
that
day
would
soon
be
breaking
that
she
would
be
certain
to
find
some
house
and
that
everywhere
the
people
would
protect
her
against
the
mauprats
i
will
not
leave
you
she
persisted
in
answering
you
have
devoted
yourself
to
me
i
will
show
the
same
devotion
to
you
we
will
both
escape
or
we
will
die
i
am
not
mistaken
i
cried
it
is
a
light
that
i
see
between
the
branches
edmee
there
is
a
house
yonder
go
and
knock
at
the
door
you
need
not
feel
anxious
about
leaving
me
here
and
you
will
find
a
guide
to
take
you
whatever
happens
she
said
i
will
not
leave
you
but
i
will
try
to
find
some
one
to
help
yet
no
i
said
i
will
not
let
you
knock
at
that
door
alone
that
light
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
a
house
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
may
be
a
i
dragged
myself
as
far
as
the
door
it
felt
cold
as
if
of
metal
the
walls
were
covered
with
ivy
who
is
there
cried
some
one
within
before
we
had
knocked
we
are
saved
cried
edmee
it
is
patience
s
we
are
lost
i
said
he
and
i
are
mortal
enemies
fear
nothing
she
said
follow
me
it
was
god
that
led
us
yes
it
was
god
that
led
you
here
daughter
of
heaven
morning
star
said
patience
opening
the
door
and
whoever
is
with
you
is
welcome
too
at
gazeau
we
entered
under
a
surbased
vault
in
the
middle
of
which
hung
an
iron
lamp
by
the
light
of
this
dismal
luminary
and
of
a
handful
of
brushwood
which
was
blazing
on
the
hearth
we
saw
not
without
surprise
that
gazeau
tower
was
exceptionally
honoured
with
visitors
on
one
side
the
light
fell
upon
the
pale
and
serious
face
of
a
man
in
clerical
garb
on
the
other
a
hat
overshadowed
a
sort
of
cone
terminating
in
a
scanty
beard
and
on
the
wall
could
be
seen
the
shadow
of
a
nose
so
distinctly
tapered
that
nothing
in
the
world
might
compare
with
it
except
perhaps
a
long
rapier
lying
across
the
knees
of
the
personage
in
question
and
a
little
dog
s
face
which
from
its
pointed
shape
might
have
been
mistaken
for
that
of
a
gigantic
rat
in
fact
it
seemed
as
if
a
mysterious
harmony
reigned
between
these
three
salient
points
the
nose
of
don
marcasse
his
dog
s
snout
and
the
blade
of
his
sword
he
got
up
slowly
and
raised
his
hand
to
his
hat
the
jansenist
cure
did
the
same
the
dog
thrust
its
head
forward
between
its
master
s
legs
and
silent
like
him
showed
its
teeth
and
put
back
its
ears
without
barking
quiet
blaireau
said
marcasse
to
it
vii
no
sooner
had
the
cure
recognised
edmee
than
he
started
back
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
but
this
was
nothing
to
the
stupefaction
of
patience
when
he
had
examined
my
features
by
the
light
of
the
burning
brand
that
served
him
as
torch
the
lamb
in
the
company
of
the
wolf
he
cried
what
has
happened
then
my
friend
replied
edmee
putting
to
my
infinite
astonishment
her
little
white
hand
into
the
sorcerer
s
big
rough
palm
welcome
him
as
you
welcome
me
i
was
a
prisoner
at
and
it
was
he
who
rescued
may
the
sins
of
his
fathers
be
forgiven
him
for
this
act
said
the
cure
patience
took
me
by
the
arm
without
saying
anything
and
led
me
nearer
the
fire
they
seated
me
on
the
only
chair
in
the
house
and
the
cure
took
upon
himself
the
task
of
attending
to
my
leg
while
edmee
gave
an
account
up
to
a
certain
point
of
our
adventure
then
she
asked
for
information
about
the
hunt
and
about
her
father
patience
however
could
give
her
no
news
he
had
heard
the
horn
in
the
woods
and
the
firing
at
the
wolves
had
disturbed
his
tranquility
several
times
during
the
day
but
since
the
storm
broke
over
them
the
noise
of
the
wind
had
drowned
all
other
sounds
and
he
knew
nothing
of
what
was
taking
place
in
varenne
marcasse
meanwhile
had
very
nimbly
climbed
a
ladder
which
served
as
an
approach
to
the
upper
stories
of
the
house
now
that
the
staircase
was
broken
his
dog
followed
him
with
marvellous
skill
soon
they
came
down
again
and
we
learned
that
a
red
light
could
be
distinguished
on
the
horizon
in
the
direction
of
in
spite
of
the
loathing
i
had
for
this
place
and
its
owners
i
could
not
repress
a
feeling
very
much
like
consternation
on
hearing
that
the
hereditary
manor
which
bore
my
own
name
had
apparently
been
taken
and
set
on
fire
it
meant
disgrace
defeat
and
this
fire
was
as
a
seal
of
vassalage
affixed
to
my
arms
by
those
i
called
clodhoppers
and
serfs
i
sprang
up
from
my
chair
and
had
i
not
been
held
back
by
the
violent
pain
in
my
foot
i
believe
i
should
have
rushed
out
what
is
the
matter
said
edmee
who
was
by
my
side
at
the
time
the
matter
is
i
answered
abruptly
that
i
must
return
yonder
for
it
is
my
duty
to
get
killed
rather
than
let
my
uncles
parley
with
the
the
rabble
cried
patience
addressing
me
for
the
first
time
since
i
arrived
who
dares
to
talk
of
rabble
here
i
myself
am
of
the
rabble
it
is
my
title
and
i
shall
know
how
to
make
it
by
jove
not
by
me
i
said
pushing
away
the
cure
who
had
made
me
sit
down
again
and
yet
it
would
not
be
for
the
first
time
replied
patience
with
a
contemptuous
smile
you
remind
me
i
answered
that
we
two
have
some
old
accounts
to
and
heedless
of
the
frightful
agony
caused
by
my
sprain
i
rose
again
and
with
a
backhander
i
sent
don
marcasse
who
was
endeavouring
the
play
the
cure
s
part
of
peacemaker
head
over
heels
into
the
middle
of
the
ashes
i
did
not
mean
him
any
harm
but
my
movements
were
somewhat
rough
and
the
poor
man
was
so
frail
that
to
my
hand
he
was
but
as
a
weasel
would
have
been
to
his
own
patience
was
standing
before
me
with
his
arms
crossed
in
the
attitude
of
a
stoic
philosopher
but
the
fire
was
flashing
in
his
eyes
conscious
of
his
position
as
my
host
he
was
evidently
waiting
until
i
struck
the
first
blow
before
attempting
to
crush
me
i
should
not
have
kept
him
waiting
long
had
not
edmee
scorning
the
danger
of
interfering
with
a
madman
seized
my
arm
and
said
in
an
authoritative
tone
sit
down
again
and
be
quiet
i
command
so
much
boldness
and
confidence
surprised
and
pleased
me
at
the
same
time
the
rights
which
she
arrogated
to
herself
over
me
were
in
some
measure
a
sanction
of
those
i
claimed
to
have
over
her
you
are
right
i
answered
sitting
down
and
i
added
with
a
glance
at
patience
some
other
amen
he
answered
shrugging
his
shoulders
marcasse
had
picked
himself
up
with
much
composure
and
shaking
off
the
ashes
with
which
he
was
covered
instead
of
finding
fault
with
me
he
tried
after
his
fashion
to
lecture
patience
this
was
in
reality
by
no
means
easy
to
do
yet
nothing
could
have
been
less
irritating
than
that
monosyllabic
censure
throwing
out
its
little
note
in
the
thick
of
a
quarrel
like
an
echo
in
a
storm
at
your
age
he
said
to
his
host
not
patient
at
all
wholly
to
blame
yes
wrong
you
how
naughty
you
are
edmee
said
to
me
putting
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
do
not
begin
again
or
i
shall
go
away
and
leave
i
willingly
let
myself
be
scolded
by
her
nor
did
i
realize
that
during
the
last
minutes
we
had
exchanged
parts
the
moment
we
crossed
the
threshold
of
gazeau
tower
she
had
given
evidence
of
that
superiority
over
me
which
was
really
hers
this
wild
place
too
these
strange
witnesses
this
fierce
host
had
already
furnished
a
taste
of
the
society
into
which
i
had
entered
and
whose
fetters
i
was
soon
to
feel
come
she
said
turning
to
patience
we
do
not
understand
each
other
here
and
for
my
part
i
am
devoured
by
anxiety
about
my
poor
father
who
is
no
doubt
searching
for
me
and
wringing
his
hands
at
this
very
moment
my
good
patience
do
find
me
some
means
of
rejoining
him
with
this
unfortunate
boy
whom
i
dare
not
leave
to
your
care
since
you
have
not
sufficient
love
for
me
to
be
patient
and
compassionate
with
what
do
you
say
said
patience
putting
his
hand
to
his
brow
as
if
waking
from
a
dream
yes
you
are
right
i
am
an
old
brute
an
old
fool
daughter
of
god
tell
this
boy
this
nobleman
that
i
ask
his
pardon
for
the
past
and
that
for
the
present
my
poor
cell
is
at
his
disposal
is
that
well
said
yes
patience
answered
the
cure
besides
everything
may
be
managed
my
horse
is
quiet
and
steady
and
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
can
ride
it
while
you
and
marcasse
lead
it
by
the
bridle
for
myself
i
will
remain
here
with
our
invalid
i
promise
to
take
good
care
of
him
and
not
to
annoy
him
in
any
way
that
will
do
won
t
it
monsieur
bernard
you
don
t
bear
me
any
and
you
may
be
very
sure
that
i
am
not
your
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
answered
it
is
as
you
please
look
after
my
cousin
take
her
home
safely
for
my
own
part
i
need
nothing
and
care
for
no
one
a
bundle
of
straw
and
a
glass
of
wine
that
is
all
i
should
like
if
it
were
possible
to
have
you
shall
have
both
said
marcasse
handing
me
his
flask
but
first
of
all
here
is
something
to
cheer
you
up
i
am
going
to
the
stable
to
get
the
horse
no
i
will
go
myself
said
patience
you
see
to
the
wants
of
this
young
and
he
passed
into
another
lower
hall
which
served
as
a
stable
for
the
cure
s
horse
during
the
visits
which
the
good
priest
paid
him
they
brought
the
animal
through
the
room
where
we
were
and
patience
after
arranging
the
cure
s
cloak
on
the
saddle
with
fatherly
care
helped
edmee
to
mount
one
moment
she
said
before
letting
them
lead
her
out
monsieur
le
cure
will
you
promise
me
on
the
salvation
of
your
soul
not
to
leave
my
cousin
before
i
return
with
my
father
to
fetch
him
i
promise
solemnly
replied
the
cure
and
you
bernard
said
edmee
will
you
give
me
your
word
of
honour
to
wait
for
me
here
i
can
t
say
i
answered
that
will
depend
on
the
length
of
your
absence
and
on
my
patience
but
you
know
quite
well
cousin
that
we
shall
meet
again
even
if
it
be
in
hell
and
for
my
part
the
sooner
the
by
the
light
of
the
brand
which
patience
was
holding
to
examine
the
horse
s
harness
i
saw
her
beautiful
face
flush
and
then
turn
pale
then
she
raised
her
eyes
which
had
been
lowered
in
sorrow
and
looked
at
me
fixedly
with
a
strange
expression
are
we
ready
to
start
said
marcasse
opening
the
door
yes
forward
said
patience
taking
the
bridle
edmee
my
child
take
care
to
bend
down
while
passing
under
the
what
is
the
matter
blaireau
said
marcasse
stopping
on
the
threshold
and
thrusting
out
the
point
of
his
sword
gloriously
rusted
by
the
blood
of
the
rodent
tribe
blaireau
did
not
stir
and
if
he
had
not
been
born
dumb
as
his
master
said
he
would
have
barked
but
he
gave
warning
as
usual
by
a
sort
of
dry
cough
this
was
his
most
emphatic
sign
of
anger
and
uneasiness
there
must
be
something
down
there
said
marcasse
and
he
boldly
advanced
into
the
darkness
after
making
a
sign
to
the
rider
not
to
follow
the
report
of
firearms
made
us
all
start
edmee
jumped
down
lightly
from
her
horse
and
i
did
not
fail
to
notice
that
some
impulse
at
once
prompted
her
to
come
and
stand
behind
my
chair
patience
rushed
out
of
the
tower
the
cure
ran
to
the
frightened
horse
which
was
rearing
and
backing
toward
us
blaireau
managed
to
bark
i
forgot
my
sprain
and
in
a
single
bound
i
was
outside
a
man
covered
with
wounds
and
with
the
blood
streaming
from
him
was
lying
across
the
doorway
it
was
my
uncle
laurence
he
had
been
mortally
wounded
at
the
siege
of
and
had
come
to
die
under
our
eyes
with
him
was
his
brother
leonard
who
had
just
fired
his
last
pistol
shot
at
random
luckily
without
hitting
any
one
patience
s
first
impulse
was
to
prepare
to
defend
himself
on
recognising
marcasse
however
the
fugitives
far
from
showing
themselves
hostile
asked
for
shelter
and
help
as
their
situation
was
so
desperate
no
one
thought
that
assistance
should
be
refused
the
police
were
pursuing
them
was
in
flames
louis
and
peter
had
died
fighting
antony
john
and
walter
had
fled
in
another
direction
and
perhaps
were
already
prisoners
no
words
would
paint
the
horror
of
laurence
s
last
moments
his
agony
was
brief
but
terrible
his
blasphemy
made
the
cure
turn
pale
scarce
had
the
door
been
shut
and
the
dying
man
laid
on
the
floor
than
the
horrible
was
heard
leonard
who
knew
of
no
remedy
but
brandy
snatched
marcasse
s
flask
out
of
my
hand
not
without
swearing
and
scornfully
reproaching
me
for
my
flight
forced
open
his
brother
s
clinched
teeth
with
the
blade
of
his
and
in
spite
of
our
warning
poured
half
the
flask
down
his
throat
the
wretched
man
bounded
into
the
air
brandished
his
arms
in
desperate
convulsions
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
fell
back
stone
dead
upon
the
floor
there
was
no
time
to
offer
up
a
prayer
over
the
body
for
the
door
resounded
under
the
furious
blows
of
our
assailants
open
in
the
king
s
name
cried
several
voices
open
to
the
police
help
help
cried
leonard
seizing
his
knife
and
rushing
towards
the
door
peasants
prove
yourselves
nobles
and
you
bernard
atone
for
your
fault
wash
out
your
shame
do
not
let
a
mauprat
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
gendarmes
alive
urged
on
by
native
courage
and
by
pride
i
was
about
to
follow
his
example
when
patience
rushed
at
him
and
exerting
his
herculean
strength
threw
him
to
the
ground
putting
one
knee
on
his
chest
he
called
to
marcasse
to
open
the
door
this
was
done
before
i
could
take
my
uncle
s
part
against
his
terrible
assailant
six
gendarmes
at
once
rushed
into
the
tower
and
with
their
guns
pointed
bade
us
move
at
our
peril
stay
gentlemen
said
patience
don
t
harm
any
one
this
is
your
prisoner
had
i
been
alone
with
him
i
should
either
have
defended
him
or
helped
him
to
escape
but
there
are
honest
people
here
who
ought
not
to
suffer
for
a
knave
and
i
did
not
wish
to
expose
them
to
a
fight
here
is
the
mauprat
your
duty
as
you
know
is
to
deliver
him
safe
and
sound
into
the
hands
of
justice
this
other
is
monsieur
surrender
said
the
sergeant
of
the
gendarmes
laying
his
hand
on
leonard
never
shall
a
mauprat
drag
his
name
into
the
dock
of
a
police
court
replied
leonard
with
a
sullen
expression
i
surrender
but
you
will
get
nothing
but
my
and
he
allowed
himself
to
be
placed
in
a
chair
without
making
any
resistance
but
while
they
were
preparing
to
bind
him
he
said
to
the
cure
do
me
one
last
kindness
father
give
me
what
is
left
in
the
flask
i
am
dying
of
thirst
and
the
good
cure
handed
him
the
flask
which
he
emptied
at
a
draught
his
distorted
face
took
on
an
expression
of
awful
calm
he
seemed
absorbed
stunned
incapable
of
resistance
but
as
soon
as
they
were
engaged
in
binding
his
feet
he
snatched
a
pistol
from
the
belt
of
one
of
the
gendarmes
and
blew
his
brains
out
this
frightful
spectacle
completely
unnerved
me
sunk
in
a
dull
stupor
no
longer
conscious
of
what
was
happening
around
me
i
stood
there
as
if
turned
to
stone
and
it
was
only
after
some
minutes
that
i
realized
that
i
was
the
subject
of
a
serious
discussion
between
the
police
and
my
hosts
one
of
the
gendarmes
declared
that
he
recognised
me
as
a
hamstringer
mauprat
patience
declared
that
i
was
nothing
but
hubert
de
mauprat
s
gamekeeper
in
charge
of
his
daughter
annoyed
at
the
discussion
i
was
about
to
make
myself
known
when
i
saw
a
ghost
rise
by
my
side
it
was
edmee
she
had
taken
refuge
between
the
wall
and
the
cure
s
poor
frightened
horse
which
with
outstretched
legs
and
eyes
of
fire
made
her
a
sort
of
rampart
with
its
body
she
was
as
pale
as
death
and
her
lips
were
so
compressed
with
horror
that
at
first
in
spite
of
desperate
efforts
to
speak
she
was
unable
to
express
herself
otherwise
than
by
signs
the
sergeant
moved
by
her
youth
and
her
painful
situation
waited
with
deference
until
she
could
manage
to
make
herself
understood
at
last
she
persuaded
them
not
to
treat
me
as
a
prisoner
but
to
take
me
with
her
to
her
father
s
chateau
where
she
gave
her
word
of
honour
that
satisfactory
explanations
and
guarantees
would
be
furnished
on
my
account
the
cure
and
the
other
witnesses
having
pledged
their
words
to
this
we
set
out
all
together
edmee
on
the
sergeant
s
horse
he
on
an
animal
belonging
to
one
of
his
men
myself
on
the
cure
s
patience
and
the
cure
afoot
between
us
the
police
on
either
side
and
marcasse
in
front
still
impassive
amid
the
general
terror
and
consternation
two
of
the
gendarmes
remained
behind
to
guard
the
bodies
and
prepare
a
report
viii
we
had
travelled
about
a
league
through
the
woods
wherever
other
paths
had
crossed
our
own
we
had
stopped
to
call
aloud
for
edmee
convinced
that
her
father
would
not
return
home
without
finding
her
had
implored
her
companions
to
help
her
to
rejoin
him
to
this
shouting
the
gendarmes
had
been
very
averse
as
they
were
afraid
of
being
discovered
and
attacked
by
bodies
of
the
fugitives
from
on
our
way
they
informed
us
that
this
den
had
been
captured
at
the
third
assault
until
then
the
assailants
had
husbanded
their
forces
the
officer
in
command
of
the
gendarmes
was
anxious
to
get
possession
of
the
keep
without
destroying
it
and
above
all
to
take
the
defenders
alive
this
however
was
impossible
on
account
of
the
desperate
resistance
they
made
the
besiegers
suffered
so
severely
in
their
second
attempt
that
they
found
themselves
compelled
to
adopt
extreme
measures
or
to
retreat
they
therefore
set
the
outer
buildings
on
fire
and
in
the
ensuing
assault
put
forth
all
their
strength
two
mauprats
were
killed
while
fighting
on
the
ruins
of
their
bastion
the
other
five
disappeared
six
men
were
dispatched
in
pursuit
of
them
in
one
direction
six
in
another
traces
of
the
fugitives
had
been
discovered
immediately
and
the
men
who
gave
us
these
details
had
followed
laurence
and
leonard
so
closely
that
several
of
their
shots
had
hit
the
former
only
a
short
distance
from
gazeau
tower
they
had
heard
him
cry
that
he
was
done
for
and
as
far
as
they
could
see
leonard
had
carried
him
to
the
sorcerer
s
door
this
leonard
was
the
only
one
of
my
uncles
who
deserved
any
pity
for
he
was
the
only
one
who
might
perhaps
have
been
encouraged
to
a
better
kind
of
life
at
times
there
was
a
touch
of
chivalry
in
his
brigandage
and
his
savage
heart
was
capable
of
affection
i
was
deeply
moved
therefore
by
his
tragic
death
and
let
myself
be
carried
along
mechanically
plunged
in
gloomy
thoughts
and
determined
to
end
my
days
in
the
same
manner
should
i
ever
be
condemned
to
the
disgrace
he
had
scorned
to
endure
all
at
once
the
sound
of
horns
and
the
baying
of
hounds
announced
the
approach
of
a
party
of
huntsmen
while
we
on
our
side
were
answering
with
shouts
patience
ran
to
meet
them
edmee
longing
to
see
her
father
again
and
forgetting
all
the
horrors
of
this
bloody
night
whipped
up
her
horse
and
reached
the
hunters
first
as
soon
as
we
came
up
with
them
i
saw
edmee
in
the
arms
of
a
tall
man
with
a
venerable
face
he
was
richly
dressed
his
with
gold
lace
over
all
the
seams
and
the
magnificent
norman
horse
which
a
groom
was
holding
behind
him
so
struck
me
that
i
thought
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
prince
the
signs
of
love
which
he
was
showing
his
daughter
were
so
new
to
me
that
i
was
inclined
to
deem
them
exaggerated
and
unworthy
of
the
dignity
of
a
man
at
the
same
time
they
filled
me
with
a
sort
of
brute
jealousy
for
it
did
not
occur
to
my
mind
that
a
man
so
splendidly
dressed
could
be
my
uncle
edmee
was
speaking
to
him
in
a
low
voice
but
with
great
animation
their
conversation
lasted
a
few
moments
at
the
end
of
it
the
old
man
came
and
embraced
me
cordially
everything
about
these
manners
seemed
so
new
to
me
that
i
responded
neither
by
word
nor
gesture
to
the
protestations
and
caresses
of
which
i
was
the
object
a
tall
young
man
with
a
handsome
face
as
elegantly
dressed
as
hubert
also
came
and
shook
my
hand
and
proffered
thanks
why
i
could
not
understand
he
next
entered
into
a
discussion
with
the
gendarmes
and
i
gathered
that
he
was
the
of
the
province
and
that
he
was
ordering
them
to
set
me
at
liberty
for
the
present
that
i
might
accompany
my
uncle
to
his
chateau
where
he
undertook
to
be
responsible
for
me
the
gendarmes
then
left
us
for
the
chevalier
and
the
were
sufficiently
well
escorted
by
their
own
men
not
to
fear
attack
from
any
one
a
fresh
cause
of
astonishment
for
me
was
to
see
the
chevalier
bestowing
marks
of
warm
friendship
on
patience
and
marcasse
as
for
the
cure
he
was
upon
a
footing
of
equality
with
these
seigneurs
for
some
months
he
had
been
chaplain
at
the
chateau
of
having
previously
been
compelled
to
give
up
his
living
by
the
persecutions
of
the
diocesan
clergy
all
this
tenderness
of
which
edmee
was
the
object
this
family
affection
so
completely
new
to
me
the
genuinely
cordial
relations
existing
between
respectful
plebeians
and
kindly
patricians
everything
that
i
now
saw
and
heard
seemed
like
a
dream
i
looked
on
with
a
sensation
that
it
was
all
unintelligible
to
me
however
soon
after
our
caravan
started
my
brain
began
to
work
for
i
then
saw
the
de
la
marche
thrust
his
horse
between
edmee
s
and
my
own
as
if
he
had
a
right
to
be
next
to
her
i
remembered
her
telling
me
at
that
he
was
her
betrothed
hatred
and
anger
at
once
surged
up
within
me
and
i
know
not
what
absurdity
i
should
have
committed
had
not
edmee
apparently
divining
the
workings
of
my
unruly
soul
told
him
that
she
wanted
to
speak
to
me
and
thus
restored
me
to
my
place
by
her
side
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
i
asked
with
more
eagerness
than
politeness
nothing
she
answered
in
an
undertone
i
shall
have
much
to
say
later
until
then
will
you
do
everything
i
ask
of
you
and
why
the
devil
should
i
do
everything
you
ask
of
me
cousin
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
to
reply
then
making
an
effort
she
said
because
it
is
thus
that
a
man
proves
to
a
woman
that
he
loves
do
you
believe
that
i
don
t
love
you
i
replied
abruptly
how
should
i
know
she
said
this
doubt
astonished
me
very
much
and
i
tried
to
combat
it
after
my
fashion
are
you
not
beautiful
i
said
and
am
not
i
a
young
man
perhaps
you
think
i
am
too
much
of
a
boy
to
notice
a
woman
s
beauty
but
now
that
my
head
is
calm
and
i
am
sad
and
quite
serious
i
can
assure
you
that
i
am
even
more
deeply
in
love
with
you
than
i
thought
the
more
i
look
at
you
the
more
beautiful
you
seem
i
did
not
think
that
a
woman
could
be
so
lovely
i
tell
you
i
shall
not
sleep
till
hold
your
tongue
she
said
sharply
oh
i
suppose
you
are
afraid
that
man
will
hear
me
i
answered
pointing
to
de
la
marche
have
no
fear
i
know
how
to
keep
my
word
and
as
you
are
the
daughter
of
a
noble
house
i
hope
you
know
how
to
keep
she
did
not
reply
we
had
reached
a
part
of
the
road
where
it
was
only
possible
for
two
to
walk
abreast
the
darkness
was
profound
and
although
the
chevalier
and
the
were
at
our
heels
i
was
going
to
make
bold
to
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
when
she
said
to
me
in
a
sad
and
weary
voice
cousin
forgive
me
for
not
talking
to
you
i
m
afraid
i
did
not
quite
understand
what
you
said
i
am
so
exhausted
that
i
feel
as
if
i
were
going
to
die
luckily
we
have
reached
home
now
promise
me
that
you
will
love
my
father
that
you
will
yield
to
all
his
wishes
that
you
will
decide
nothing
without
consulting
me
promise
me
this
if
you
would
have
me
believe
in
your
oh
my
friendship
you
are
welcome
not
to
believe
in
that
i
answered
but
you
must
believe
in
my
love
i
promise
everything
you
wish
and
you
will
you
not
promise
me
anything
do
now
with
a
good
what
can
i
promise
that
is
not
yours
she
said
in
a
serious
tone
you
saved
my
honour
my
life
belongs
to
the
first
glimmerings
of
dawn
were
now
beginning
to
light
the
horizon
we
had
reached
the
village
of
and
soon
afterward
we
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
chateau
on
dismounting
from
her
horse
edmee
fell
into
her
father
s
arms
she
was
as
pale
as
death
de
la
marche
uttered
a
cry
and
helped
to
carry
her
away
she
had
fainted
the
cure
took
charge
of
me
i
was
very
uneasy
about
my
fate
the
natural
distrust
of
the
brigand
sprang
up
again
as
soon
as
i
ceased
to
be
under
the
spell
of
her
who
had
managed
to
lure
me
from
my
den
i
was
like
a
wounded
wolf
i
cast
sullen
glances
about
me
ready
to
rush
at
the
first
being
who
should
stir
my
suspicions
by
a
doubtful
word
or
deed
i
was
taken
into
a
splendid
room
and
a
meal
prepared
with
a
luxury
far
beyond
anything
i
could
have
conceived
was
immediately
served
the
cure
displayed
the
kindest
interest
in
me
and
having
succeeded
in
reassuring
me
a
little
he
went
to
attend
to
his
friend
patience
the
disturbed
state
of
my
mind
and
my
remnant
of
uneasiness
were
not
proof
against
the
generous
appetite
of
youth
had
it
not
been
for
the
respectful
assiduity
of
a
valet
much
better
dressed
than
myself
who
stood
behind
my
chair
and
whose
politeness
i
could
not
help
returning
whenever
he
hastened
to
anticipate
my
wants
i
should
have
made
a
terrific
breakfast
as
it
was
the
green
coat
and
silk
breeches
embarrassed
me
considerably
it
was
much
worse
when
going
down
on
his
knees
he
set
about
taking
off
my
boots
preparatory
to
putting
me
to
bed
for
the
moment
i
thought
he
was
playing
a
trick
upon
me
and
came
very
near
giving
him
a
good
blow
on
the
head
but
his
manner
was
so
serious
as
he
went
through
this
task
that
i
sat
and
stared
at
him
in
amazement
at
first
at
finding
myself
in
bed
without
arms
and
with
people
entering
and
leaving
my
room
always
on
i
again
began
to
feel
suspicious
i
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
i
was
alone
to
get
out
of
bed
and
take
from
the
table
which
was
only
half
cleared
the
longest
knife
i
could
find
feeling
easier
in
my
mind
i
returned
to
bed
and
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
with
the
knife
firmly
clasped
in
my
hand
when
i
awoke
again
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
softened
by
my
red
damask
curtains
were
falling
on
my
beautifully
fine
sheets
and
lighting
up
the
golden
pomegranates
that
adorned
the
corners
of
the
bed
this
bed
was
so
handsome
and
soft
that
i
felt
inclined
to
make
it
my
apologies
for
having
slept
in
it
as
i
was
about
to
get
up
i
saw
a
kindly
venerable
face
looking
through
the
curtains
and
smiling
it
was
the
chevalier
hubert
de
mauprat
he
inquired
anxiously
about
the
state
of
my
health
i
endeavoured
to
be
polite
and
to
express
my
gratitude
but
the
language
i
used
seemed
so
different
from
his
that
i
was
disconcerted
and
pained
at
my
awkwardness
without
being
able
to
realize
why
to
crown
my
misery
a
movement
that
i
made
caused
the
knife
which
i
had
taken
as
bedfellow
to
fall
at
de
mauprat
s
feet
he
picked
it
up
looked
at
it
and
then
at
myself
with
extreme
surprise
i
turned
as
red
as
fire
and
stammered
out
i
know
not
what
i
expected
he
would
reprove
me
for
this
insult
to
his
hospitality
however
he
was
too
polite
to
insist
upon
a
more
complete
explanation
he
quietly
placed
the
knife
on
the
and
returning
to
me
spoke
as
follows
bernard
i
now
know
that
i
owe
to
you
the
life
that
i
hold
dearest
in
the
world
all
my
own
life
shall
be
devoted
to
giving
you
proofs
of
my
gratitude
and
esteem
my
daughter
also
is
sacredly
indebted
to
you
you
need
then
have
no
anxiety
about
your
future
i
know
what
persecution
and
vengeance
you
exposed
yourself
to
in
coming
to
us
but
i
know
too
from
what
a
frightful
existence
my
friendship
and
devotion
will
be
able
to
deliver
you
you
are
an
orphan
and
i
have
no
son
will
you
have
me
for
your
father
i
stared
at
the
chevalier
with
wild
eyes
i
could
not
believe
my
ears
all
feeling
within
me
seemed
paralyzed
by
astonishment
and
timidity
i
was
unable
to
answer
a
word
the
chevalier
himself
evidently
felt
some
astonishment
he
had
not
expected
to
find
a
nature
so
brutishly
come
he
said
i
hope
that
you
will
grow
accustomed
to
us
at
all
events
shake
hands
to
show
that
you
trust
me
i
will
send
up
your
servant
give
him
your
orders
he
is
at
your
disposal
i
have
only
one
promise
to
exact
from
you
and
that
is
that
you
will
not
go
beyond
the
walls
of
the
park
until
i
have
taken
steps
to
make
you
safe
from
the
pursuit
of
justice
at
present
it
is
possible
that
the
charges
which
have
been
hanging
over
your
uncles
heads
might
be
made
to
fall
on
your
my
uncles
i
exclaimed
putting
my
hand
to
my
brow
is
this
all
a
hideous
dream
where
are
they
what
has
become
of
he
answered
has
been
saved
from
the
flames
only
a
few
of
the
outer
buildings
have
been
destroyed
but
i
undertake
to
repair
the
house
and
to
redeem
your
fief
from
the
creditors
who
claim
it
as
to
your
uncles
you
are
probably
the
sole
heir
of
a
name
that
it
behoves
you
to
the
sole
heir
i
cried
four
mauprats
fell
last
night
but
the
other
three
the
fifth
walter
perished
in
his
attempt
to
escape
his
body
was
discovered
this
morning
in
the
pond
of
les
froids
neither
john
nor
antony
has
been
caught
but
the
horse
belonging
to
one
and
a
cloak
of
the
other
s
found
near
the
spot
where
walter
s
body
was
lying
seem
to
hint
darkly
that
their
fate
was
as
his
even
if
one
of
them
manages
to
escape
he
will
never
dare
make
himself
known
again
for
there
would
be
no
hope
for
him
and
since
they
have
drawn
down
upon
their
heads
the
inevitable
storm
it
is
best
both
for
themselves
and
for
us
who
unfortunately
bear
the
same
name
that
they
should
have
come
to
this
tragic
end
better
to
have
fallen
weapon
in
hand
than
to
have
suffered
an
infamous
death
upon
the
gallows
let
us
bow
to
what
god
has
ordained
for
them
it
is
a
stern
judgment
seven
men
in
the
pride
of
youth
and
strength
summoned
in
a
single
night
to
their
terrible
reckoning
we
must
pray
for
them
bernard
and
by
dint
of
good
works
try
to
make
good
the
evil
they
have
done
and
remove
the
stains
they
have
left
on
our
these
concluding
words
summed
up
the
chevalier
s
whole
character
he
was
pious
just
and
full
of
charity
but
with
him
as
with
most
nobles
the
precepts
of
christian
humility
were
wont
to
fall
before
the
pride
of
rank
he
would
gladly
have
had
a
poor
man
at
his
table
and
on
good
friday
indeed
he
used
to
wash
the
feet
of
twelve
beggars
but
he
was
none
the
less
attached
to
all
the
prejudices
of
our
caste
in
trampling
under
foot
the
dignity
of
man
my
cousins
he
considered
had
as
noblemen
been
much
more
culpable
than
they
would
have
been
as
plebeians
on
the
latter
hypothesis
according
to
him
their
crimes
would
not
have
been
half
so
grave
for
a
long
time
i
shared
the
conviction
myself
it
was
in
my
blood
if
i
may
use
the
expression
i
lost
it
only
in
the
stern
lessons
of
my
destiny
he
then
confirmed
what
his
daughter
had
told
me
from
my
birth
he
had
earnestly
desired
to
undertake
my
education
but
his
brother
tristan
had
always
stubbornly
opposed
this
desire
there
the
chevalier
s
brow
darkened
you
do
not
know
he
said
how
baneful
have
been
the
consequences
of
that
simple
wish
of
mine
baneful
for
me
and
for
you
too
but
that
must
remain
wrapped
in
mystery
a
hideous
mystery
the
blood
of
the
atridae
he
took
my
hand
and
added
in
a
broken
voice
bernard
we
are
both
of
us
victims
of
a
vicious
family
this
is
not
the
moment
to
pile
up
charges
against
those
who
in
this
very
hour
are
standing
before
the
terrible
tribunal
of
god
but
they
have
done
me
an
irreparable
wrong
they
have
broken
my
heart
the
wrong
they
have
done
you
shall
be
repaired
i
swear
it
by
the
memory
of
your
mother
they
have
deprived
you
of
education
they
have
made
you
a
partner
in
their
brigandage
yet
your
soul
has
remained
great
and
pure
as
was
the
soul
of
the
angel
who
gave
you
birth
you
will
correct
the
mistakes
which
others
made
in
your
childhood
you
will
receive
an
education
suitable
to
your
rank
and
then
bernard
you
will
restore
the
honour
of
your
family
you
will
won
t
you
promise
me
this
bernard
it
is
the
one
thing
i
long
for
i
will
throw
myself
at
your
knees
if
so
i
may
win
your
confidence
and
i
shall
win
it
for
providence
has
destined
you
to
be
my
son
ah
once
it
was
my
dream
that
you
should
be
more
completely
mine
if
when
i
made
my
second
petition
they
had
granted
you
to
my
loving
care
you
would
have
been
brought
up
with
my
daughter
and
you
would
certainly
have
become
her
husband
but
god
would
not
have
it
so
you
have
now
to
begin
your
education
whereas
hers
is
almost
finished
she
is
of
an
age
to
marry
and
besides
her
choice
is
already
made
she
loves
de
la
marche
in
fact
their
marriage
is
soon
to
take
place
probably
she
had
told
i
stammered
out
a
few
confused
words
the
affection
and
generous
ideas
of
this
noble
man
had
moved
me
profoundly
and
i
was
conscious
of
a
new
nature
as
it
were
awakening
within
me
but
when
he
pronounced
the
name
of
his
future
all
my
savage
instincts
rose
up
again
and
i
felt
that
no
principle
of
social
loyalty
would
make
me
renounce
my
claim
to
her
whom
i
regarded
as
my
fairly
won
prize
i
grew
pale
i
grew
red
i
gasped
for
breath
luckily
we
were
interrupted
by
the
abbe
aubert
the
jansenist
cure
who
came
to
inquire
how
i
was
after
my
fall
then
for
the
first
time
the
chevalier
heard
of
my
accident
an
incident
that
had
escaped
him
amid
the
press
of
so
many
more
serious
matters
he
sent
for
his
doctor
at
once
and
i
was
overwhelmed
with
kind
attentions
which
seemed
to
me
rather
childish
but
to
which
i
submitted
from
a
sense
of
gratitude
i
had
not
dared
to
ask
the
chevalier
for
any
news
of
his
daughter
with
the
abbe
however
i
was
bolder
he
informed
me
that
the
length
and
uneasiness
of
her
sleep
were
causing
some
anxiety
and
the
doctor
when
he
returned
in
the
evening
to
dress
my
ankle
told
me
that
she
was
very
feverish
and
that
he
was
afraid
she
was
going
to
have
some
serious
illness
for
a
few
days
indeed
she
was
ill
enough
to
cause
anxiety
in
the
terrible
experience
she
had
gone
through
she
had
displayed
great
energy
but
the
reaction
was
correspondingly
violent
for
myself
i
was
also
kept
to
my
bed
i
could
not
take
a
step
without
feeling
considerable
pain
and
the
doctor
threatened
that
i
should
be
laid
up
for
several
months
if
i
did
not
submit
to
inaction
for
a
few
days
as
i
was
otherwise
in
vigorous
health
and
had
never
been
ill
in
my
life
the
change
from
any
active
habits
to
this
sluggish
captivity
caused
me
indescribable
only
those
who
have
lived
in
the
depths
of
woods
and
experienced
all
the
hardships
of
a
rough
life
can
understand
the
kind
of
horror
and
despair
i
felt
on
finding
myself
shut
up
for
more
than
a
week
between
four
silk
curtains
the
luxuriousness
of
my
room
the
gilding
of
my
bed
the
minute
attentions
of
the
lackeys
everything
even
to
the
excellence
of
the
food
trifles
which
i
had
somewhat
appreciated
the
first
day
became
odious
to
me
at
the
end
of
hours
the
chevalier
paid
me
affectionate
but
short
visits
for
he
was
absorbed
by
the
illness
of
his
darling
daughter
the
abbe
was
all
kindness
to
neither
did
i
dare
confess
how
wretched
i
felt
but
when
i
was
alone
i
felt
inclined
to
roar
like
a
caged
lion
and
at
night
i
had
dreams
in
which
the
moss
in
the
woods
the
curtain
of
forest
trees
and
even
the
gloomy
battlements
of
appeared
to
me
like
an
earthly
paradise
at
other
times
the
tragic
scenes
that
had
accompanied
and
followed
my
escape
were
reproduced
so
vividly
by
my
memory
that
even
when
awake
i
was
a
prey
to
a
sort
of
delirium
a
visit
from
de
la
marche
stirred
my
ideas
to
still
wilder
disorder
he
displayed
the
deepest
interest
in
me
shook
me
by
the
hand
again
and
again
and
implored
my
friendship
vowed
a
dozen
times
that
he
would
lay
down
his
life
for
me
and
made
i
don
t
know
how
many
other
protestations
which
i
scarcely
heard
for
his
voice
was
like
a
raging
torrent
in
my
ears
and
if
i
had
had
my
i
believe
i
should
have
thrown
myself
upon
him
my
rough
manners
and
sullen
looks
astonished
him
very
much
but
the
abbe
having
explained
that
my
mind
was
disturbed
by
the
terrible
events
which
had
happened
in
my
family
he
renewed
his
protestations
and
took
leave
of
me
in
the
most
affectionate
and
courteous
manner
this
politeness
which
i
found
common
to
everybody
from
the
master
of
the
house
to
the
meanest
of
his
servants
though
it
struck
me
with
admiration
yet
made
me
feel
strangely
ill
at
ease
for
even
if
it
had
not
been
inspired
by
towards
me
i
could
never
have
brought
myself
to
understand
that
it
might
be
something
very
different
from
real
goodness
it
bore
so
little
resemblance
to
the
facetious
braggadocio
of
the
mauprats
that
it
seemed
to
me
like
an
entirely
new
language
which
i
understood
but
could
not
speak
however
i
recovered
the
power
of
speech
when
the
abbe
announced
that
he
was
to
have
charge
of
my
education
and
began
questioning
me
about
my
attainments
my
ignorance
was
so
far
beyond
anything
he
could
have
imagined
that
i
was
getting
ashamed
to
lay
it
all
bare
and
my
savage
pride
getting
the
upper
hand
i
declared
that
i
was
a
gentleman
and
had
no
desire
to
become
a
clerk
his
only
answer
was
a
burst
of
laughter
which
offended
me
greatly
he
tapped
me
quickly
on
the
shoulder
with
a
smile
saying
that
i
should
change
my
mind
in
time
but
that
i
was
certainly
a
funny
fellow
i
was
purple
with
rage
when
the
chevalier
entered
the
abbe
told
him
of
our
conversation
and
of
my
little
speech
hubert
suppressed
a
smile
my
boy
he
said
in
a
kind
tone
i
trust
i
may
never
do
anything
to
annoy
you
even
from
affection
let
us
talk
no
more
about
work
before
conceiving
a
taste
for
it
you
must
first
realize
its
necessity
since
you
have
a
noble
heart
you
can
not
but
have
a
sound
mind
the
desire
for
knowledge
will
come
to
you
of
itself
and
now
to
supper
i
expect
you
are
hungry
do
you
like
wine
much
better
than
latin
i
replied
come
abbe
he
continued
laughingly
as
a
punishment
for
having
played
the
pedant
you
must
drink
with
us
edmee
is
now
quite
out
of
danger
the
doctor
has
said
that
bernard
can
get
up
and
walk
a
few
steps
we
will
have
supper
served
in
this
the
supper
and
wine
were
so
good
indeed
that
i
was
not
long
in
getting
tipsy
according
to
the
custom
i
even
saw
they
aided
and
abetted
in
order
to
make
me
talk
and
show
at
once
what
species
of
boor
they
had
to
deal
with
my
lack
of
education
surpassed
anything
they
had
anticipated
but
i
suppose
they
augured
well
from
my
native
powers
for
instead
of
giving
me
up
they
laboured
at
the
rough
block
with
a
zeal
which
showed
at
least
that
they
were
not
without
hope
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
leave
my
room
i
lost
the
feeling
of
the
abbe
was
my
inseparable
companion
through
the
whole
first
day
the
length
of
the
second
was
diminished
by
the
hope
they
gave
me
of
seeing
edmee
on
the
morrow
and
by
the
kindness
i
experienced
from
every
one
i
began
to
feel
the
charm
of
these
gentle
manners
in
proportion
as
i
ceased
to
be
astonished
at
them
the
goodness
of
the
chevalier
could
not
but
overcome
my
boorishness
nay
more
it
rapidly
won
my
heart
this
was
the
first
affection
of
my
life
it
took
up
its
abode
in
me
side
by
side
with
a
violent
love
for
his
daughter
nor
did
i
even
dream
of
pitting
one
of
these
feelings
against
the
other
i
was
all
yearning
all
instinct
all
desire
i
had
the
passions
of
a
man
in
the
soul
of
a
child
ix
at
last
one
morning
after
breakfast
hubert
took
me
to
see
his
daughter
when
the
door
of
her
room
was
opened
i
felt
almost
suffocated
by
the
air
which
met
me
the
room
itself
was
charming
in
its
simplicity
the
curtains
and
coverings
of
chintz
with
a
white
ground
large
china
vases
filled
with
flowers
exhaled
a
delicate
perfume
african
birds
were
sporting
in
a
gilded
cage
and
singing
their
sweet
little
love
songs
the
carpet
was
softer
to
the
feet
than
is
the
moss
of
the
woods
in
the
month
of
march
i
was
in
such
a
state
of
agitation
that
my
eyes
grew
more
and
more
dim
every
moment
my
feet
caught
in
one
another
most
awkwardly
and
i
kept
stumbling
against
the
furniture
without
being
able
to
advance
edmee
was
lying
on
a
long
white
chair
carelessly
fingering
a
fan
she
seemed
to
me
even
more
beautiful
than
before
yet
so
changed
that
a
feeling
of
apprehension
chilled
me
in
the
middle
of
my
ecstasy
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
i
did
not
like
to
kiss
it
in
the
presence
of
her
father
i
could
not
hear
what
she
was
saying
to
me
i
believe
her
words
were
full
of
affection
then
as
if
overcome
with
fatigue
she
let
her
head
fall
back
on
the
pillow
and
closed
her
eyes
i
have
some
work
to
do
said
the
chevalier
to
me
stay
here
with
her
but
do
not
make
her
talk
too
much
for
she
is
still
very
this
recommendation
really
seemed
a
sarcasm
edmee
was
pretending
to
be
sleepy
perhaps
to
conceal
some
of
the
embarrassment
that
weighed
on
her
heart
and
as
for
myself
i
felt
so
incapable
of
overcoming
her
reserve
that
it
was
in
reality
a
kindness
to
counsel
silence
the
chevalier
opened
a
door
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
closed
it
after
him
but
as
i
could
hear
him
cough
from
time
to
time
i
gathered
that
his
study
was
separated
from
his
daughter
s
room
only
by
a
wooden
partition
still
it
was
bliss
to
be
alone
with
her
for
a
few
moments
as
long
as
she
appeared
to
be
asleep
she
did
not
see
me
and
i
could
gaze
on
her
at
will
so
pale
was
she
that
she
seemed
as
white
as
her
muslin
or
as
her
satin
slippers
with
their
trimming
of
swan
s
down
her
delicate
transparent
hand
was
to
my
eyes
like
some
unknown
jewel
never
before
had
i
realized
what
a
woman
was
beauty
for
me
had
hitherto
meant
youth
and
health
together
with
a
sort
of
manly
hardihood
edmee
in
her
as
i
first
beheld
her
had
in
a
measure
displayed
such
beauty
and
i
had
understood
her
better
then
now
as
i
studied
her
afresh
my
very
ideas
which
were
beginning
to
get
a
little
light
from
without
all
helped
to
make
this
second
very
different
from
the
first
but
the
strange
uneasy
pleasure
i
experienced
in
gazing
on
her
was
disturbed
by
the
arrival
of
a
duenna
a
certain
mademoiselle
leblanc
who
performed
the
duties
of
lady
s
maid
in
edmee
s
private
apartments
and
filled
the
post
of
companion
in
the
perhaps
she
had
received
orders
from
her
mistress
not
to
leave
us
certain
it
is
that
she
took
her
place
by
the
side
of
the
invalid
s
chair
in
such
a
way
as
to
present
to
my
disappointed
gaze
her
own
long
meagre
back
instead
of
edmee
s
beautiful
face
then
she
took
some
work
out
of
her
pocket
and
quietly
began
to
knit
meanwhile
the
birds
continued
to
warble
the
chevalier
to
cough
edmee
to
sleep
or
to
pretend
to
sleep
while
i
remained
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
with
my
head
bent
over
the
prints
in
a
book
that
i
was
holding
upside
down
after
some
time
i
became
aware
that
edmee
was
not
asleep
and
that
she
was
talking
to
her
attendant
in
a
low
voice
i
fancied
i
noticed
the
latter
glancing
at
me
from
time
to
time
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
in
a
somewhat
stealthy
manner
to
escape
the
ordeal
of
such
an
examination
and
also
from
an
impulse
of
cunning
which
was
by
no
means
foreign
to
my
nature
i
let
my
head
fall
on
the
book
and
the
book
on
the
and
in
this
posture
i
remained
as
if
buried
in
sleep
or
thought
then
little
by
little
their
voices
grew
louder
until
i
could
hear
what
they
were
saying
about
me
it
s
all
the
same
you
have
certainly
have
chosen
a
funny
sort
of
page
a
page
leblanc
why
do
you
talk
such
nonsense
as
if
one
had
pages
nowadays
you
are
always
imagining
we
are
still
in
my
grandmother
s
time
i
tell
you
he
is
my
father
s
adopted
m
le
chevalier
is
undoubtedly
quite
right
to
adopt
a
son
but
where
on
earth
did
he
fish
up
such
a
creature
as
that
i
gave
a
side
glance
at
them
and
saw
that
edmee
was
laughing
behind
her
fan
she
was
enjoying
the
chatter
of
this
old
maid
who
was
supposed
to
be
a
wag
and
allowed
perfect
freedom
of
speech
i
was
very
much
hurt
to
see
my
cousin
was
making
fun
of
me
he
looks
like
a
bear
a
badger
a
wolf
a
kite
anything
rather
than
a
man
continued
leblanc
what
hands
what
legs
and
now
he
has
been
cleaned
up
a
little
he
is
nothing
to
what
he
was
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
the
day
he
arrived
with
his
smock
and
his
leather
gaiters
it
was
enough
to
take
away
one
s
do
you
think
so
answered
edmee
for
my
part
i
preferred
him
in
his
poacher
s
garb
it
suited
his
face
and
figure
he
looked
like
a
bandit
you
could
not
have
looked
at
him
properly
oh
yes
i
the
tone
in
which
she
pronounced
these
words
yes
i
did
made
me
shudder
and
somehow
i
again
felt
upon
my
lips
the
impress
of
the
kiss
she
had
given
me
at
it
would
not
be
so
bad
if
his
hair
were
dressed
properly
continued
the
duenna
but
so
far
no
one
had
been
able
to
persuade
him
to
have
it
powdered
told
me
that
just
as
he
was
about
to
put
the
powder
puff
to
his
head
he
got
up
in
a
rage
and
said
anything
you
like
except
that
confounded
flour
i
want
to
be
able
to
move
my
head
about
without
coughing
and
heavens
what
a
savage
yet
in
reality
he
is
quite
right
if
fashion
did
not
sanction
the
absurdity
everybody
would
perceive
that
it
is
both
ugly
and
inconvenient
look
and
see
if
it
is
not
more
becoming
to
have
long
black
hair
like
his
long
hair
like
that
what
a
mane
it
is
enough
to
frighten
besides
boys
do
not
have
their
hair
powdered
and
he
is
still
a
a
boy
my
stars
what
a
brat
boys
why
he
would
eat
them
for
his
breakfast
he
s
a
regular
ogre
but
where
does
the
hulking
dog
spring
from
i
suppose
le
chevalier
brought
him
here
from
behind
some
plough
what
is
his
name
again
you
did
tell
me
his
name
didn
t
you
yes
inquisitive
i
told
you
he
is
called
bernard
and
nothing
else
nothing
for
the
present
what
are
you
looking
at
he
is
sleeping
like
a
dormouse
look
at
the
booby
i
was
wondering
whether
he
resembled
le
chevalier
perhaps
it
was
a
momentary
error
a
fit
of
forgetfulness
with
some
come
come
leblanc
you
are
going
too
far
goodness
gracious
mademoiselle
has
not
le
chevalier
been
young
like
any
other
man
and
that
does
not
prevent
virtue
coming
on
with
years
does
it
doubtless
your
own
experience
has
shown
you
that
this
is
possible
but
listen
don
t
take
upon
yourself
to
make
fun
of
this
young
man
it
is
possible
that
you
have
guessed
right
but
my
father
requires
him
to
be
treated
as
one
of
the
well
well
that
must
be
pleasant
for
you
mademoiselle
as
for
myself
what
does
it
matter
to
me
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
ah
if
you
were
thirty
years
but
did
your
father
consult
you
mademoiselle
before
planting
yon
great
brigand
in
your
room
why
ask
such
a
question
is
there
anywhere
in
the
world
a
better
father
than
mine
but
you
are
very
good
also
there
are
many
young
ladies
who
would
have
been
by
no
means
and
why
i
should
like
to
know
there
is
nothing
disagreeable
about
the
fellow
when
he
has
been
polished
a
little
he
will
always
be
perfectly
my
dear
leblanc
he
is
far
from
ugly
you
are
too
old
you
are
no
longer
a
judge
of
young
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
chevalier
who
came
in
to
look
for
a
book
mademoiselle
leblanc
is
here
is
she
he
said
in
a
very
quiet
tone
i
thought
you
were
alone
with
my
son
well
edmee
have
you
had
a
talk
with
him
did
you
tell
him
that
you
would
be
his
sister
are
you
pleased
with
her
bernard
such
answers
as
i
gave
could
compromise
no
one
as
a
rule
they
consisted
of
four
or
five
incoherent
words
crippled
by
shame
de
mauprat
returned
to
his
study
and
i
had
sat
down
again
hoping
that
my
cousin
was
going
to
send
away
her
duenna
and
talk
to
me
but
they
exchanged
a
few
words
in
a
whisper
the
duenna
remained
and
two
mortal
hours
passed
without
my
daring
to
stir
from
my
chair
i
believe
edmee
really
was
asleep
this
time
when
the
bell
rang
for
dinner
her
father
came
in
again
to
fetch
me
and
before
leaving
her
room
he
said
to
her
again
well
have
you
had
a
chat
yes
father
dear
she
replied
with
an
assurance
that
astounded
me
my
cousin
s
behaviour
seemed
to
me
to
prove
beyond
doubt
that
she
had
merely
been
trifling
with
me
and
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
my
reproaches
and
yet
hope
sprang
up
again
when
i
remembered
the
strain
in
which
she
had
spoken
of
me
to
mademoiselle
leblanc
i
even
succeeded
in
persuading
myself
that
she
feared
arousing
her
father
s
suspicions
and
that
she
was
now
feigning
complete
indifference
only
to
draw
me
the
more
surely
to
her
arms
as
soon
as
the
favourable
moment
had
arrived
as
it
was
impossible
to
ascertain
the
truth
i
resigned
myself
to
waiting
but
days
and
nights
passed
without
any
explanation
being
sent
or
any
secret
message
bidding
me
be
patient
she
used
to
come
down
to
the
for
an
hour
in
the
morning
in
the
evening
she
was
present
at
dinner
and
then
would
play
piquet
or
chess
with
her
father
during
all
this
time
she
was
so
well
watched
that
i
could
not
exchange
a
glance
with
her
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
remained
in
her
own
room
inaccessible
noticing
that
i
was
chafing
at
the
species
of
captivity
in
which
i
was
compelled
to
live
the
chevalier
frequently
said
to
me
go
and
have
a
chat
with
edmee
you
can
go
to
her
room
and
tell
her
that
i
sent
but
it
was
in
vain
that
i
knocked
no
doubt
they
had
heard
me
coming
and
had
recognised
me
by
my
heavy
shuffling
step
the
door
was
never
opened
to
me
i
grew
desperate
furious
here
i
must
interrupt
the
account
of
my
personal
impressions
to
tell
you
what
was
happening
at
this
time
in
the
luckless
mauprat
family
john
and
antony
had
really
managed
to
escape
and
though
a
very
close
search
had
been
made
for
them
they
had
not
as
yet
been
captured
all
their
property
was
seized
and
an
order
issued
by
the
courts
for
the
sale
of
the
fief
as
it
proved
however
a
sale
was
unnecessary
hubert
de
mauprat
put
an
end
to
the
proceedings
by
coming
forward
as
purchaser
the
creditors
were
paid
off
and
the
of
passed
into
his
hands
the
little
garrison
kept
by
the
mauprats
made
up
of
adventurers
of
the
lowest
type
had
met
the
same
fate
as
their
masters
as
i
have
already
said
the
garrison
had
long
been
reduced
to
a
few
individuals
two
or
three
of
these
were
killed
others
took
to
flight
one
only
was
captured
this
man
was
tried
and
made
to
suffer
for
all
a
serious
question
arose
as
to
whether
judgment
should
not
also
be
given
against
john
and
antony
de
mauprat
by
default
there
was
apparently
no
doubt
that
they
had
fled
the
pond
in
which
walter
s
body
was
found
floating
had
been
drained
yet
no
traces
of
the
bodies
had
been
discovered
the
chevalier
however
for
the
sake
of
the
name
he
bore
strove
to
prevent
the
disgrace
of
an
ignominious
sentence
as
if
such
a
sentence
could
have
added
aught
to
the
horror
of
the
name
of
mauprat
he
brought
to
bear
all
de
la
marche
s
influence
and
his
own
which
was
very
real
in
the
province
especially
on
account
of
his
high
moral
character
to
hush
up
the
affair
and
he
succeeded
as
for
myself
though
i
had
certainly
had
a
hand
in
more
than
one
of
my
uncles
robberies
there
was
no
thought
of
discussing
me
even
at
the
bar
of
public
opinion
in
the
storm
of
anger
that
my
uncles
had
aroused
people
were
pleased
to
consider
me
simply
as
a
young
captive
a
victim
of
their
cruelty
and
thoroughly
well
disposed
towards
everybody
certainly
in
his
generous
good
nature
and
desire
to
rehabilitate
the
family
the
chevalier
greatly
exaggerated
my
merits
and
spread
a
report
everywhere
that
i
was
an
angel
of
sweetness
and
intelligence
on
the
day
that
hubert
became
purchaser
of
the
estate
he
entered
my
room
early
in
the
morning
accompanied
by
his
daughter
and
the
abbe
showing
me
the
documents
which
bore
witness
to
his
sacrifice
was
valued
at
about
two
hundred
thousand
francs
he
declared
that
i
was
forthwith
going
to
be
put
in
possession
not
only
of
my
share
in
the
inheritance
which
was
by
no
means
considerable
but
also
of
half
the
revenue
of
the
property
at
the
same
time
he
said
the
whole
estate
lands
and
produce
should
be
secured
to
me
by
his
will
on
one
condition
namely
that
i
would
consent
to
receive
an
education
suitable
to
my
position
the
chevalier
had
made
all
these
arrangements
in
the
kindness
of
his
heart
and
without
ostentation
partly
out
of
gratitude
for
the
service
he
knew
i
had
rendered
edmee
and
partly
from
family
pride
but
he
had
not
expected
that
i
should
prove
so
stubborn
on
the
question
of
education
i
can
not
tell
you
the
irritation
i
felt
at
this
word
condition
especially
as
i
thought
i
detected
in
it
signs
of
some
plan
that
edmee
had
formed
to
free
herself
from
her
promise
to
me
uncle
i
answered
after
listening
to
all
his
magnificent
offers
in
absolute
silence
i
thank
you
for
all
you
wish
to
do
for
me
but
it
is
not
right
that
i
should
avail
myself
of
your
kindness
i
have
no
need
of
a
fortune
a
man
like
myself
wants
nothing
but
a
little
bread
a
gun
a
hound
and
the
first
inn
he
comes
to
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
since
you
are
good
enough
to
act
as
my
guardian
pay
me
the
income
on
my
eighth
of
the
fief
and
do
not
ask
me
to
learn
that
latin
bosh
a
man
of
birth
is
sufficiently
well
educated
when
he
knows
how
to
bring
down
a
snipe
and
sign
his
name
i
have
no
desire
to
be
seigneur
of
it
is
enough
to
have
been
a
slave
there
you
are
most
kind
and
on
my
honour
i
love
you
but
i
have
very
little
love
for
conditions
i
have
never
done
anything
from
interested
motives
i
would
rather
remain
an
ignoramus
than
develop
a
pretty
wit
for
another
s
dole
moreover
i
could
never
consent
to
make
such
a
hole
in
my
cousin
s
fortune
though
i
know
perfectly
well
that
she
would
willingly
sacrifice
a
part
of
her
dowry
to
obtain
release
from
edmee
who
until
now
had
remained
very
pale
and
apparently
heedless
of
my
words
all
at
once
cast
a
lightning
glance
at
me
and
said
with
an
air
of
unconcern
to
obtain
a
release
from
what
may
i
ask
bernard
i
saw
that
in
spite
of
this
show
of
courage
she
was
very
much
perturbed
for
she
broke
her
fan
while
shutting
it
i
answered
her
with
a
look
in
which
the
artless
malice
of
the
rustic
must
have
been
apparent
to
obtain
release
cousin
from
a
certain
promise
you
made
me
at
she
grew
paler
than
ever
and
on
her
face
i
could
see
an
expression
of
terror
but
by
a
smile
of
contempt
what
was
the
promise
you
made
him
edmee
asked
the
chevalier
turning
towards
her
ingenuously
at
the
same
time
the
abbe
pressed
my
arm
furtively
and
i
understood
that
my
cousin
s
confessor
was
in
possession
of
the
secret
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
their
fears
did
me
an
injustice
though
they
roused
my
pity
she
promised
me
i
replied
with
a
smile
that
she
would
always
look
upon
me
as
a
brother
and
a
friend
were
not
those
your
words
edmee
and
do
you
think
it
is
possible
to
make
them
good
by
mere
money
she
rose
as
if
filled
with
new
life
and
holding
out
her
hand
to
me
said
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
you
are
right
bernard
yours
is
a
noble
heart
and
i
should
never
forgive
myself
if
i
doubted
it
for
a
i
caught
sight
of
a
tear
on
the
edge
of
her
and
i
pressed
her
hand
somewhat
too
roughly
no
doubt
for
she
could
not
restrain
a
little
cry
followed
however
by
a
charming
smile
the
chevalier
clasped
me
to
his
breast
and
the
abbe
rocked
about
in
his
chair
and
exclaimed
repeatedly
how
beautiful
how
noble
how
very
beautiful
ah
he
added
that
is
something
that
can
not
be
learnt
from
books
turning
to
the
chevalier
god
writes
his
words
and
breathes
forth
his
spirit
upon
the
hearts
of
the
you
will
see
said
the
chevalier
deeply
moved
that
this
mauprat
will
yet
build
up
the
honour
of
the
family
again
and
now
my
dear
bernard
i
will
say
no
more
about
business
i
know
how
i
ought
to
act
and
you
can
not
prevent
me
from
taking
such
steps
as
i
shall
think
fit
to
insure
the
rehabilitation
of
my
name
by
yourself
the
only
true
rehabilitation
is
guaranteed
by
your
noble
sentiments
but
there
is
still
another
which
i
know
you
will
not
refuse
to
attempt
the
way
to
this
lies
through
your
talents
and
intelligence
you
will
make
the
effort
out
of
love
for
us
i
hope
however
we
need
not
talk
of
this
at
present
i
respect
your
proud
spirit
and
i
gladly
renew
my
offers
without
conditions
and
now
abbe
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
accompany
me
to
the
town
to
see
my
lawyer
the
carriage
is
waiting
as
for
you
children
you
can
have
lunch
together
come
bernard
offer
your
arm
to
your
cousin
or
rather
to
your
sister
you
must
acquire
some
courtesy
of
manner
since
in
her
case
it
will
be
but
the
expression
of
your
that
is
true
uncle
i
answered
taking
hold
of
edmee
s
arm
somewhat
roughly
to
lead
her
downstairs
i
could
feel
her
trembling
but
the
pink
had
returned
to
her
cheeks
and
a
smile
of
affection
was
playing
about
her
lips
as
soon
as
we
were
seated
opposite
each
other
at
table
our
happy
harmony
was
chilled
in
a
very
few
moments
we
both
returned
to
our
former
state
of
embarrassment
had
we
been
alone
i
should
have
got
out
of
the
difficulty
by
one
of
those
abrupt
sallies
which
i
knew
how
to
force
from
myself
when
i
grew
too
much
ashamed
of
my
bashfulness
but
the
presence
of
who
was
waiting
upon
us
condemned
me
to
silence
on
the
subject
next
to
my
heart
i
decided
therefore
to
talk
about
patience
i
asked
her
how
it
came
to
pass
that
she
was
on
such
good
terms
with
him
and
in
what
light
i
ought
to
look
upon
the
pretended
sorcerer
she
gave
me
the
main
points
in
the
history
of
the
rustic
philosopher
and
explained
that
it
was
the
abbe
aubert
who
had
taken
her
to
gazeau
tower
she
had
been
much
struck
by
the
intelligence
and
wisdom
of
the
stoic
hermit
and
used
to
derive
great
pleasure
from
conversation
with
him
on
his
side
patience
had
conceived
such
a
friendship
for
her
that
for
some
time
he
had
relaxed
his
strict
habits
and
would
frequently
pay
her
a
visit
when
he
came
to
see
the
abbe
as
you
may
imagine
she
had
no
little
difficulty
in
making
these
explanations
intelligible
to
me
i
was
very
much
surprised
at
the
praise
she
bestowed
on
patience
and
at
the
sympathy
she
showed
for
his
revolutionary
ideas
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
a
peasant
spoken
of
as
a
man
besides
i
had
hitherto
looked
upon
the
sorcerer
of
gazeau
tower
as
very
much
below
the
ordinary
peasant
and
here
was
edmee
praising
him
above
most
of
the
men
she
knew
and
even
siding
with
him
against
the
nobles
from
this
i
drew
the
comfortable
conclusion
that
education
was
not
so
essential
as
the
chevalier
and
the
abbe
would
have
me
believe
i
can
scarcely
read
any
better
than
patience
i
added
and
i
only
wish
you
found
as
much
pleasure
in
my
society
as
in
his
but
it
hardly
appears
so
cousin
for
since
i
came
here
we
were
then
leaving
the
table
and
i
was
rejoicing
at
the
prospect
of
being
alone
with
her
at
last
so
that
i
might
talk
more
freely
when
on
going
into
the
we
found
de
la
marche
there
he
had
just
arrived
and
was
in
the
act
of
entering
by
the
opposite
door
in
my
heart
i
wished
him
at
the
devil
de
la
march
was
one
of
the
fashionable
young
nobles
of
the
day
smitten
with
the
new
philosophy
devoted
to
voltaire
a
great
admirer
of
franklin
more
than
intelligent
understanding
the
oracles
less
than
he
desired
or
pretended
to
understand
them
a
pretty
poor
logician
since
he
found
his
ideas
much
less
excellent
and
his
political
hopes
much
less
sweet
on
the
day
that
the
french
nation
took
it
into
its
head
to
realize
them
for
the
rest
full
of
fine
sentiments
believing
himself
much
more
sanguine
and
romantic
than
he
was
in
reality
rather
more
faithful
to
the
prejudices
of
caste
and
considerably
more
sensitive
to
the
opinion
of
the
world
than
he
flattered
and
prided
himself
on
being
such
was
the
man
his
face
was
certainly
handsome
but
i
found
it
excessively
dull
for
i
had
conceived
the
most
ridiculous
animosity
for
him
his
polished
manners
seemed
to
me
abjectly
servile
with
edmee
i
should
have
blushed
to
imitate
them
and
yet
my
sole
aim
was
to
surpass
him
in
the
little
services
he
rendered
her
we
went
out
into
the
park
this
was
very
large
and
through
it
ran
the
indre
here
merely
a
pretty
stream
during
our
walk
he
made
himself
agreeable
in
a
thousand
ways
not
a
violet
did
he
see
but
he
must
pluck
it
to
offer
to
my
cousin
but
when
we
arrived
at
the
banks
of
the
stream
we
found
that
the
plank
which
usually
enabled
one
to
cross
at
this
particular
spot
had
been
broken
and
washed
away
by
the
storms
of
a
few
days
before
without
asking
permission
i
immediately
took
edmee
in
my
arms
and
quietly
walked
through
the
stream
the
water
came
up
to
my
waist
but
i
carried
my
cousin
at
arm
s
length
so
securely
and
skilfully
that
she
did
not
wet
a
single
ribbon
de
la
marche
unwilling
to
appear
more
delicate
than
myself
did
not
hesitate
to
wet
his
fine
clothes
and
follow
me
though
with
some
rather
poor
efforts
the
while
to
force
a
laugh
however
though
he
had
not
any
burden
to
carry
he
several
times
stumbled
over
the
stones
which
covered
the
bed
of
the
river
and
rejoined
us
only
with
great
difficulty
edmee
was
far
from
laughing
i
believe
that
this
proof
of
my
strength
and
daring
forced
on
her
in
spite
of
herself
terrified
her
as
an
evidence
of
the
love
she
had
stirred
in
me
she
even
appeared
to
be
annoyed
and
as
i
set
her
down
gently
on
the
bank
said
bernard
i
must
request
you
never
to
play
such
a
prank
that
is
all
very
well
i
said
you
would
not
be
angry
if
it
were
the
other
he
would
not
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
she
replied
i
quite
believe
it
i
answered
he
would
take
very
good
care
of
that
just
look
at
the
chap
and
i
i
did
not
ruffle
a
hair
of
your
head
he
is
very
good
at
picking
violets
but
take
my
word
for
it
in
a
case
of
danger
don
t
make
him
your
first
de
la
marche
paid
me
great
compliments
on
this
exploit
i
had
hoped
that
he
would
be
jealous
he
did
not
even
appear
to
dream
of
it
but
rather
made
merry
over
the
pitiable
state
of
his
toilet
the
day
was
excessively
hot
and
we
were
quite
dry
before
the
end
of
the
walk
edmee
however
remained
sad
and
pensive
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
making
an
effort
to
show
me
as
much
friendship
as
at
luncheon
this
affected
me
considerably
for
i
was
not
only
enamoured
of
her
i
loved
her
i
could
not
make
the
distinction
then
but
both
feelings
were
in
me
passion
and
tenderness
the
chevalier
and
the
abbe
returned
in
time
for
dinner
they
conversed
in
a
low
voice
with
de
la
marche
about
the
settlement
of
my
affairs
and
from
the
few
words
which
i
could
not
help
overhearing
i
gathered
that
they
had
just
secured
my
future
on
the
bright
lines
they
had
laid
before
me
in
the
morning
i
was
too
shy
and
proud
to
express
my
simple
thanks
this
generosity
perplexed
me
i
could
not
understand
it
and
i
almost
suspected
that
it
was
a
trap
they
were
preparing
to
separate
me
from
my
cousin
i
did
not
realize
the
advantage
of
a
fortune
mine
were
not
the
wants
of
a
civilized
being
and
the
prejudices
of
rank
were
with
me
a
point
of
honour
and
by
no
means
a
social
vanity
seeing
that
they
did
not
speak
to
me
openly
i
played
the
somewhat
ungracious
part
of
feigning
complete
ignorance
edmee
grew
more
and
more
melancholy
i
noticed
that
her
eyes
rested
now
on
de
la
marche
now
on
her
father
with
a
vague
uneasiness
whenever
i
spoke
to
her
or
even
raised
my
voice
in
addressing
others
she
would
start
and
then
knit
her
brows
slightly
as
if
my
voice
had
caused
her
physical
pain
she
retired
immediately
after
dinner
her
father
followed
her
with
evident
anxiety
have
you
not
noticed
said
the
abbe
turning
to
de
la
marche
as
soon
as
they
had
left
the
room
that
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
has
very
much
changed
of
late
she
has
grown
thinner
answered
the
but
in
my
opinion
she
is
only
the
more
beautiful
for
yes
but
i
fear
she
may
be
more
seriously
ill
than
she
owns
replied
the
abbe
her
temperament
seems
no
less
changed
than
her
face
she
has
grown
quite
sad
why
i
don
t
think
i
ever
saw
her
so
gay
as
she
was
this
morning
don
t
you
agree
with
me
monsieur
bernard
it
was
only
after
our
walk
that
she
complained
of
a
slight
i
assure
you
that
she
is
really
sad
rejoined
the
abbe
nowadays
when
she
is
gay
her
gaiety
is
excessive
at
such
a
time
there
seems
to
be
something
strange
and
forced
about
her
which
is
quite
foreign
to
her
usual
manner
then
the
next
minute
she
relapses
into
a
state
of
melancholy
which
i
never
noticed
before
the
famous
night
in
the
forest
you
may
be
certain
that
night
was
a
terrible
true
she
was
obliged
to
witness
a
frightful
scene
at
gazeau
tower
said
de
la
marche
and
then
she
must
have
been
very
much
exhausted
and
frightened
when
her
horse
bolted
from
the
field
and
galloped
right
through
the
forest
yet
her
pluck
is
so
remarkable
that
what
do
you
think
my
dear
monsieur
bernard
when
you
met
her
in
the
forest
did
she
seem
very
frightened
in
the
forest
i
said
i
did
not
meet
her
in
the
forest
at
no
it
was
in
varenne
that
you
met
her
wasn
t
it
the
abbe
hastened
to
intervene
monsieur
bernard
can
you
spare
me
a
minute
to
talk
over
a
little
matter
connected
with
your
property
at
hereupon
he
drew
me
out
of
the
and
said
in
a
low
voice
there
is
no
question
of
business
i
only
want
to
beg
of
you
not
to
let
a
single
soul
not
even
de
la
marche
suspect
that
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
was
at
for
the
fraction
of
a
and
why
i
asked
was
she
not
under
my
protection
there
did
she
not
leave
it
pure
thanks
to
me
must
it
not
be
well
known
to
the
neighbourhood
that
she
passed
two
hours
there
at
present
no
one
knows
he
answered
at
the
very
moment
she
left
it
fell
before
the
attack
of
the
police
and
not
one
of
its
inmates
will
return
from
the
grave
or
from
exile
to
proclaim
the
fact
when
you
know
the
world
better
you
will
understand
how
important
it
is
for
the
reputation
of
a
young
lady
that
none
should
have
reason
to
suppose
that
even
a
shadow
of
danger
has
fallen
upon
her
honour
meanwhile
i
implore
you
in
the
name
of
her
father
in
the
name
of
the
affection
for
her
which
you
expressed
this
morning
in
so
noble
and
touching
a
manner
you
are
very
clever
monsieur
l
abbe
i
said
interrupting
him
all
your
words
have
a
hidden
meaning
which
i
can
grasp
perfectly
well
clown
as
i
am
tell
my
cousin
that
she
may
set
her
mind
at
ease
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
her
virtue
that
is
very
certain
and
i
trust
i
am
not
capable
of
spoiling
the
marriage
she
desires
tell
her
that
i
claim
but
one
thing
of
her
the
fulfilment
of
that
promise
of
friendship
which
she
made
me
at
in
your
eyes
then
that
promise
has
a
peculiar
solemnity
said
the
abbe
if
so
what
grounds
for
distrusting
it
have
you
i
looked
at
him
fixedly
and
as
he
appeared
very
much
agitated
i
took
a
pleasure
in
keeping
him
on
the
rack
hoping
that
he
would
repeat
my
words
to
edmee
none
i
answered
only
i
observe
that
you
are
afraid
that
de
la
marche
may
break
off
the
marriage
if
he
happens
to
hear
of
the
adventure
at
if
the
gentleman
is
capable
of
suspecting
edmee
and
of
grossly
insulting
her
on
the
eve
of
his
wedding
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
one
very
simple
means
of
mending
what
would
you
suggest
why
to
challenge
him
and
kill
i
trust
you
will
do
all
you
can
to
spare
the
venerable
hubert
the
necessity
of
facing
such
a
hideous
i
will
spare
him
this
and
many
others
by
taking
upon
myself
to
avenge
my
cousin
in
truth
this
is
my
right
monsieur
l
abbe
i
know
the
duties
of
a
gentleman
quite
as
well
as
if
i
had
learnt
latin
you
may
tell
her
this
from
me
let
her
sleep
in
peace
i
will
keep
silence
and
if
that
is
useless
i
will
but
bernard
replied
the
abbe
in
a
gentle
insinuating
tone
have
you
thought
of
your
cousin
s
affection
for
de
la
marche
all
the
more
reason
that
i
should
fight
him
i
cried
in
a
fit
of
anger
and
i
turned
my
back
on
him
abruptly
the
abbe
retailed
the
whole
of
our
conversation
to
the
penitent
the
part
that
the
worthy
priest
had
to
play
was
very
embarrassing
under
the
seal
of
confession
he
had
been
intrusted
with
a
secret
to
which
in
his
conversations
with
me
he
could
make
only
indirect
allusions
to
bring
me
to
understand
that
my
pertinacity
was
a
crime
and
that
the
only
honourable
course
was
to
yield
he
hoped
too
much
of
me
virtue
such
as
this
was
beyond
my
power
and
equally
beyond
my
understanding
x
a
few
days
passed
in
apparent
calm
edmee
said
she
was
unwell
and
rarely
quitted
her
room
de
la
marche
called
nearly
every
day
his
chateau
being
only
a
short
distance
off
my
dislike
for
him
grew
stronger
and
stronger
in
spite
of
all
the
politeness
he
showed
me
i
understood
nothing
whatever
of
his
dabblings
in
philosophy
and
i
opposed
all
his
opinions
with
the
grossest
prejudices
and
expressions
at
my
command
what
consoled
me
in
a
measure
for
my
secret
sufferings
was
to
see
that
he
was
no
more
admitted
than
myself
to
edmee
s
rooms
for
a
week
the
sole
event
of
note
was
that
patience
took
up
his
abode
in
a
hut
near
the
chateau
ever
since
the
abbe
aubert
had
found
a
refuge
from
ecclesiastical
persecution
under
the
chevalier
s
roof
he
had
no
longer
been
obliged
to
arrange
secret
meetings
with
the
hermit
he
had
therefore
strongly
urged
him
to
give
up
his
dwelling
in
the
forest
and
to
come
nearer
to
himself
patience
had
needed
a
great
deal
of
persuasion
long
years
of
solitude
had
so
attached
him
to
his
gazeau
tower
that
he
hesitated
to
desert
it
for
the
society
of
his
friend
besides
he
declared
that
the
abbe
would
assuredly
be
corrupted
with
commerce
with
the
great
that
soon
unknown
to
himself
he
would
come
under
the
influence
of
the
old
ideas
and
that
his
zeal
for
the
sacred
cause
would
grow
cold
it
is
true
that
edmee
had
won
patience
s
heart
and
that
in
offering
him
a
little
cottage
belonging
to
her
father
situated
in
a
picturesque
ravine
near
the
park
gate
she
had
gone
to
work
with
such
grace
and
delicacy
that
not
even
his
techy
pride
could
feel
wounded
in
fact
it
was
to
conclude
these
important
negotiations
that
the
abbe
had
betaken
himself
to
gazeau
tower
with
marcasse
on
that
very
evening
when
edmee
and
myself
sought
shelter
there
the
terrible
scene
which
followed
our
arrival
put
an
end
to
any
irresolution
still
left
in
patience
inclined
to
the
pythagorean
doctrines
he
had
a
horror
of
all
bloodshed
the
death
of
a
deer
drew
tears
from
him
as
from
shakespeare
s
jacques
still
less
could
he
bear
to
contemplate
the
murder
of
a
human
being
and
the
instant
that
gazeau
tower
had
served
as
the
scene
of
two
tragic
deaths
it
stood
defiled
in
his
eyes
and
nothing
could
have
induced
him
to
pass
another
night
there
he
followed
us
to
and
soon
allowed
his
philosophical
scruples
to
be
overcome
by
edmee
s
persuasive
powers
the
little
cottage
which
he
was
prevailed
on
to
accept
was
humble
enough
not
to
make
him
blush
with
shame
at
a
too
palpable
compromise
with
civilization
and
though
the
solitude
he
found
there
was
less
perfect
than
at
gazeau
tower
the
frequent
visits
of
the
abbe
and
of
edmee
could
hardly
have
given
him
a
right
to
complain
here
the
narrator
interrupted
his
story
again
to
expatiate
on
the
development
of
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
s
character
edmee
hidden
away
in
her
modest
obscurity
was
and
believe
me
i
do
not
speak
from
bias
one
of
the
most
perfect
women
to
be
found
in
france
had
she
desired
or
been
compelled
to
make
herself
known
to
the
world
she
would
assuredly
have
been
famous
and
extolled
beyond
all
her
sex
but
she
found
her
happiness
in
her
own
family
and
the
sweetest
simplicity
crowned
her
mental
powers
and
lofty
virtues
she
was
ignorant
of
her
worth
as
i
myself
was
at
that
time
when
brutelike
i
saw
only
with
the
eyes
of
the
body
and
believed
i
loved
her
only
because
she
was
beautiful
it
should
be
said
too
that
her
de
la
marche
understood
her
but
little
better
he
had
developed
the
weakly
mind
with
which
he
was
endowed
in
the
frigid
school
of
voltaire
and
helvetius
edmee
had
fired
her
vast
intellect
with
the
burning
declamations
of
jean
jacques
a
day
came
when
i
could
understand
her
the
day
when
de
la
marche
could
have
understood
her
would
never
have
come
edmee
deprived
of
her
mother
from
the
very
cradle
and
left
to
her
young
devices
by
a
father
full
of
confidence
and
careless
good
nature
had
shaped
her
character
almost
alone
the
abbe
aubert
who
had
confirmed
her
had
by
no
means
forbidden
her
to
read
the
philosophers
by
whom
he
himself
had
been
lured
from
the
paths
of
orthodoxy
finding
no
one
to
oppose
her
ideas
or
even
to
discuss
them
for
her
father
who
idolized
her
allowed
himself
to
be
led
wherever
she
wished
edmee
had
drawn
support
from
two
sources
apparently
very
antagonistic
the
philosophy
which
was
preparing
the
downfall
of
christianity
and
christianity
which
was
proscribing
the
spirit
of
inquiry
to
account
for
this
contradiction
you
must
recall
what
i
told
you
about
the
effect
produced
on
the
abbe
aubert
by
the
de
foi
du
vicaire
moreover
you
must
be
aware
that
in
poetic
souls
mysticism
and
doubt
often
reign
side
by
side
jean
jacques
himself
furnishes
a
striking
example
of
this
and
you
know
what
sympathies
he
stirred
among
priests
and
nobles
even
when
he
was
chastising
them
so
unmercifully
what
miracles
may
not
conviction
work
when
helped
by
sublime
eloquence
edmee
had
drunk
of
this
living
fount
with
all
the
eagerness
of
an
ardent
soul
in
her
rare
visits
to
paris
she
had
sought
for
spirits
in
sympathy
with
her
own
there
however
she
had
found
so
many
shades
of
opinion
so
little
harmony
and
despite
the
prevailing
fashion
so
many
ineradicable
prejudices
that
she
had
returned
with
a
yet
deeper
love
to
her
solitude
and
her
poetic
reveries
under
the
old
oaks
in
the
park
she
would
even
then
speak
of
her
illusions
and
with
a
good
sense
beyond
her
years
perhaps
too
beyond
her
sex
she
refused
all
opportunities
of
direct
intercourse
with
the
philosophers
whose
writings
made
up
her
intellectual
life
i
am
somewhat
of
a
sybarite
she
would
say
with
a
smile
i
would
rather
have
a
bouquet
of
roses
arranged
for
me
in
a
vase
in
the
early
morning
than
go
and
gather
them
myself
from
out
their
thorns
in
the
heat
of
the
as
a
fact
this
remark
about
her
sybaritism
was
only
a
jest
brought
up
in
the
country
she
was
strong
active
brave
and
full
of
life
to
all
her
charms
of
delicate
beauty
she
united
the
energy
of
physical
and
moral
health
she
was
the
and
fearless
girl
no
less
than
the
sweet
and
affable
mistress
of
the
house
i
often
found
her
haughty
and
disdainful
patience
and
the
poor
of
the
district
never
found
her
anything
but
modest
and
edmee
loved
the
poets
almost
as
much
as
the
transcendental
philosophers
in
her
walks
she
always
carried
a
book
in
her
hand
one
day
when
she
had
taken
tasso
with
her
she
met
patience
who
as
was
his
wont
inquired
minutely
into
both
author
and
subject
edmee
thereupon
had
to
give
him
an
account
of
the
crusades
this
was
not
the
most
difficult
part
of
her
task
thanks
to
the
stores
of
information
derived
from
the
abbe
and
to
his
prodigious
memory
for
facts
patience
had
a
passable
knowledge
of
the
outlines
of
universal
history
but
what
he
had
great
trouble
in
grasping
was
the
connection
and
difference
between
epic
poetry
and
history
at
first
he
was
indignant
at
the
inventions
of
the
poets
and
declared
that
such
impostures
ought
never
to
have
been
allowed
then
when
he
had
realized
that
epic
poetry
far
from
leading
generations
into
error
only
raised
heroic
deeds
to
vaster
proportions
and
a
more
enduring
glory
he
asked
how
it
was
that
all
important
events
had
not
been
sung
by
the
bards
and
why
the
history
of
man
had
not
been
embodied
in
a
popular
form
capable
of
impressing
itself
on
every
mind
without
the
help
of
letters
he
begged
edmee
to
explain
to
him
a
stanza
of
as
he
took
a
fancy
to
it
she
read
him
a
canto
in
french
a
few
days
later
she
read
him
another
and
soon
patience
knew
the
whole
poem
he
rejoiced
to
hear
that
the
heroic
tale
was
popular
in
italy
and
bringing
together
his
recollections
of
it
endeavoured
to
give
them
an
abridged
form
in
rude
prose
but
he
had
no
memory
for
words
roused
by
his
vivid
impressions
he
would
call
up
a
thousand
mighty
images
before
his
eyes
he
would
give
utterance
to
them
in
improvisations
wherein
his
genius
triumphed
over
the
uncouthness
of
his
language
but
he
could
never
repeat
what
he
had
once
said
one
would
have
had
to
take
it
down
from
his
dictation
and
even
that
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
him
for
supposing
he
had
managed
to
read
it
his
memory
accustomed
to
occupy
itself
solely
with
thoughts
had
never
been
able
to
retain
any
fragment
whatever
in
its
precise
words
and
yet
he
was
fond
of
quoting
and
at
times
his
language
was
almost
biblical
beyond
however
certain
expressions
that
he
loved
and
a
number
of
short
sentences
that
he
found
means
to
make
his
own
he
remembered
nothing
of
the
pages
which
had
been
read
to
him
so
often
and
he
always
listened
to
them
again
with
the
same
emotion
as
at
first
it
was
a
veritable
pleasure
to
watch
the
effect
of
beautiful
poetry
on
this
powerful
intellect
little
by
little
the
abbe
edmee
and
subsequently
i
myself
managed
to
familiarize
him
with
homer
and
dante
he
was
so
struck
by
the
various
incidents
in
the
that
he
could
give
an
analysis
of
the
poem
from
beginning
to
end
without
forgetting
or
misplacing
the
slightest
detail
in
the
journey
the
encounters
and
the
emotions
of
the
poet
there
however
his
power
ended
if
he
essayed
to
repeat
some
of
the
phrases
which
had
so
charmed
him
when
they
were
read
he
flung
forth
a
mass
of
metaphors
and
images
which
savoured
of
delirium
this
initiation
into
the
wonders
of
poetry
marked
an
epoch
in
the
life
of
patience
in
the
realm
of
fancy
it
supplied
the
action
wanting
to
his
real
life
in
his
magic
mirror
he
beheld
gigantic
combats
between
heroes
ten
cubits
high
he
understood
love
which
he
himself
had
never
known
he
fought
he
loved
he
conquered
he
enlightened
nations
gave
peace
to
the
world
redressed
the
wrongs
of
mankind
and
raised
up
temples
to
the
mighty
spirit
of
the
universe
he
saw
in
the
starry
firmament
all
the
gods
of
olympus
the
fathers
of
primitive
humanity
in
the
constellations
he
read
the
story
of
the
golden
age
and
of
the
ages
of
brass
in
the
winter
wind
he
heard
the
songs
of
morven
and
in
the
he
bowed
to
the
ghosts
of
fingal
and
comala
before
i
knew
the
poets
he
said
towards
the
end
of
his
life
i
was
a
man
lacking
in
one
of
the
senses
i
could
see
plainly
that
this
sense
was
necessary
since
there
were
so
many
things
calling
for
its
operation
in
my
solitary
walks
at
night
i
used
to
feel
a
strange
uneasiness
i
used
to
wonder
why
i
could
not
sleep
why
i
should
find
such
pleasure
in
gazing
upon
the
stars
that
i
could
not
tear
myself
from
their
presence
why
my
heart
should
suddenly
beat
with
joy
on
seeing
certain
colours
or
grow
sad
even
to
tears
on
hearing
certain
sounds
at
times
i
was
so
alarmed
on
comparing
my
continual
agitation
with
the
indifference
of
other
men
of
my
class
that
i
even
began
to
imagine
that
i
was
mad
but
i
soon
consoled
myself
with
the
reflection
that
such
madness
was
sweet
and
i
would
rather
have
ceased
to
exist
than
be
cured
of
it
now
that
i
know
these
things
have
been
thought
beautiful
in
all
times
and
by
all
intelligent
beings
i
understand
what
they
are
and
how
they
are
useful
to
man
i
find
joy
in
the
thought
that
there
is
not
a
flower
not
a
colour
not
a
breath
of
air
which
has
not
absorbed
the
minds
and
stirred
the
hearts
of
other
men
till
it
has
received
a
name
sacred
among
all
peoples
since
i
have
learnt
that
it
is
allowed
to
man
without
degrading
his
reason
to
people
the
universe
and
interpret
it
by
his
dreams
i
live
wholly
in
the
contemplation
of
the
universe
and
when
the
sight
of
the
misery
and
crime
in
the
world
bruises
my
heart
and
shakes
my
reason
i
fall
back
upon
my
dreams
i
say
to
myself
that
since
all
men
are
united
in
their
love
of
the
works
of
god
some
day
they
will
also
be
united
in
their
love
of
one
another
i
imagine
that
education
grows
more
and
more
perfect
from
father
to
son
it
may
be
that
i
am
the
first
untutored
man
who
has
divined
truths
of
which
no
glimpse
was
given
him
from
without
it
may
be
too
that
many
others
before
myself
have
been
perplexed
by
the
workings
of
their
hearts
and
brains
and
have
died
without
ever
finding
an
answer
to
the
ah
we
poor
folk
added
patience
we
are
never
forbidden
excess
in
labour
or
in
wine
or
in
any
of
the
debauches
which
may
destroy
our
minds
there
are
some
people
who
pay
dearly
for
the
work
of
our
arms
so
that
the
poor
in
their
eagerness
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
their
families
may
work
beyond
their
strength
there
are
taverns
and
other
places
more
dangerous
still
from
which
so
it
is
said
the
government
draws
a
good
profit
and
there
are
priests
too
who
get
up
in
their
pulpits
to
tell
us
what
we
owe
to
the
lord
of
our
village
but
never
what
the
lord
owes
to
us
nowhere
is
there
a
school
where
they
teach
us
our
real
rights
where
they
show
us
how
to
distinguish
our
true
and
decent
wants
from
the
shameful
and
fatal
ones
where
in
short
they
tell
us
what
we
can
and
ought
to
think
about
when
we
have
borne
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
for
the
profit
of
others
and
are
sitting
in
the
evening
at
the
door
of
our
huts
gazing
on
the
red
stars
as
they
come
out
on
the
thus
would
patience
reason
and
believe
me
in
translating
his
words
into
our
conventional
language
i
am
robbing
them
of
all
their
grace
all
their
fire
and
all
their
vigour
but
who
could
repeat
the
exact
words
of
patience
his
was
a
language
used
by
none
but
himself
it
was
a
mixture
of
the
limited
though
forcible
vocabulary
of
the
peasants
and
of
the
boldest
metaphors
of
the
poets
whose
poetic
turns
he
would
often
make
bolder
still
to
this
mixed
idiom
his
sympathetic
mind
gave
order
and
logic
an
incredible
wealth
of
thought
made
up
for
the
brevity
of
the
phrases
that
clothed
it
you
should
have
seen
how
desperately
his
will
and
convictions
strove
to
overcome
the
impotence
of
his
language
any
other
than
he
would
have
failed
to
come
out
of
the
struggle
with
honour
and
i
assure
you
that
any
one
capable
of
something
more
serious
than
laughing
at
his
solecisms
and
audacities
of
phrase
would
have
found
in
this
man
material
for
the
most
important
studies
on
the
development
of
the
human
mind
and
an
incentive
to
the
most
tender
admiration
for
primitive
moral
beauty
when
subsequently
i
came
to
understand
patience
thoroughly
i
found
a
bond
of
sympathy
with
him
in
my
own
exceptional
destiny
like
him
i
had
been
without
education
like
him
i
had
sought
outside
myself
for
an
explanation
of
my
being
just
as
one
seeks
the
answer
to
a
riddle
thanks
to
the
accidents
of
my
birth
and
fortune
i
had
arrived
at
complete
development
while
patience
to
the
hour
of
his
death
remained
groping
in
the
darkness
of
an
ignorance
from
which
he
neither
would
nor
could
emerge
to
me
however
this
was
only
an
additional
reason
for
recognising
the
superiority
of
that
powerful
nature
which
held
its
course
more
boldly
by
the
feeble
light
of
instinct
than
i
myself
by
all
the
brilliant
lights
of
knowledge
and
which
moreover
had
not
had
a
single
evil
inclination
to
subdue
while
i
had
had
all
that
a
man
may
have
at
the
time
however
at
which
i
must
take
up
my
story
patience
was
still
in
my
eyes
merely
a
grotesque
character
an
object
of
amusement
for
edmee
and
of
kindly
compassion
for
the
abbe
aubert
when
they
spoke
to
me
about
him
in
a
serious
tone
i
no
longer
understood
them
and
i
imagined
they
took
this
subject
as
a
sort
of
text
whereon
to
build
a
parable
proving
to
me
the
advantages
of
education
the
necessity
of
devoting
myself
to
study
early
in
life
and
the
futility
of
regrets
in
after
years
yet
this
did
not
prevent
me
from
prowling
about
the
copses
about
his
new
abode
for
i
had
seen
edmee
crossing
the
park
in
that
direction
and
i
hoped
that
if
i
took
her
by
surprise
as
she
was
returning
i
should
get
a
conversation
with
her
but
she
was
always
accompanied
by
the
abbe
and
sometimes
even
by
her
father
and
if
she
remained
alone
with
the
old
peasant
he
would
escort
her
to
the
chateau
afterwards
frequently
i
have
concealed
myself
in
the
foliage
of
a
giant
which
spread
out
its
monstrous
shoots
and
drooping
branches
to
within
a
few
yards
of
the
cottage
and
have
seen
edmee
sitting
at
the
door
with
a
book
in
her
hand
while
patience
was
listening
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
as
though
he
were
overwhelmed
by
the
effort
of
attention
at
that
time
i
imagined
that
edmee
was
trying
to
teach
him
to
read
and
thought
her
mad
to
persist
in
attempting
an
impossible
education
but
how
beautiful
she
seemed
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
beneath
the
yellowing
vine
leaves
that
overhung
the
cottage
door
i
used
to
gaze
on
her
and
tell
myself
that
she
belonged
to
me
and
vow
never
to
yield
to
any
force
or
persuasion
which
should
endeavour
to
make
me
renounce
my
claim
for
some
days
my
agony
of
mind
had
been
intense
my
only
method
of
escaping
from
it
had
been
to
drink
heavily
at
supper
so
that
i
might
be
almost
stupefied
at
the
hour
for
me
so
painful
and
so
galling
when
she
would
leave
the
after
kissing
her
father
giving
her
hand
to
de
la
marche
and
saying
as
she
passed
by
me
bernard
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
say
has
ended
like
yesterday
and
will
end
like
in
vain
would
i
go
and
sit
in
the
nearest
her
door
so
that
she
could
not
pass
without
at
least
her
dress
brushing
against
me
this
was
all
i
ever
got
from
her
i
would
not
put
out
my
hand
to
beg
her
own
for
she
might
have
given
it
with
an
air
of
unconcern
and
i
verily
believe
i
should
have
crushed
it
in
my
anger
thanks
to
my
large
libations
at
supper
i
generally
succeeded
in
besotting
myself
silently
and
sadly
i
then
used
to
sink
into
my
favourite
and
remain
there
sullen
and
drowsy
until
the
fumes
of
the
wine
had
passed
away
and
i
could
go
and
air
my
wild
dreams
and
sinister
plans
in
the
park
none
seemed
to
notice
this
gross
habit
of
mine
they
showed
me
such
kindness
and
indulgence
in
the
family
that
they
seemed
afraid
to
express
disapproval
however
much
i
deserved
it
nevertheless
they
were
well
aware
of
my
shameful
passion
for
wine
and
the
abbe
informed
edmee
of
it
one
evening
at
supper
she
looked
at
me
fixedly
several
times
and
with
a
strange
expression
i
stared
at
her
in
return
hoping
that
she
would
say
something
to
provoke
me
but
we
got
no
further
than
an
exchange
of
malevolent
glances
on
leaving
the
table
she
whispered
to
me
very
quickly
and
in
an
imperious
tone
break
yourself
of
this
drinking
and
pay
attention
to
what
the
abbe
has
to
say
to
this
order
and
tone
of
authority
so
far
from
filling
me
with
hope
seemed
to
me
so
revolting
that
all
my
timidity
vanished
in
a
moment
i
waited
for
the
hour
when
she
usually
went
up
to
her
room
and
going
out
a
little
before
her
took
up
my
position
on
the
stairs
do
you
think
i
said
to
her
when
she
appeared
that
i
am
the
dupe
of
your
lies
and
that
i
have
not
seen
perfectly
during
the
month
i
have
been
here
without
your
speaking
a
word
to
me
that
you
are
merely
fooling
me
as
if
i
were
a
booby
you
lied
to
me
and
now
you
despise
me
because
i
was
honest
enough
to
believe
your
bernard
she
said
in
a
cold
tone
this
is
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
for
an
oh
i
know
well
enough
i
replied
that
according
to
you
it
will
never
be
the
time
or
the
place
but
i
shall
manage
to
find
both
do
not
fear
you
said
that
you
loved
me
you
threw
your
arms
about
my
neck
and
said
as
you
kissed
me
yes
here
i
can
still
feel
your
lips
on
my
cheeks
save
me
and
i
swear
on
the
gospel
on
my
honour
by
the
memory
of
my
mother
and
your
own
that
i
will
be
i
can
see
through
it
you
said
that
because
you
were
afraid
that
i
should
use
my
strength
and
now
you
avoid
me
because
you
are
afraid
i
shall
claim
my
right
but
you
will
gain
nothing
by
it
i
swear
that
you
shall
not
trifle
with
me
i
will
never
be
yours
she
replied
with
a
coldness
which
was
becoming
more
and
more
icy
if
you
do
not
make
some
change
in
your
language
and
manners
and
feelings
in
your
present
state
i
certainly
do
not
fear
you
when
you
appeared
to
me
good
and
generous
i
might
have
yielded
to
you
half
from
fear
and
half
from
affection
but
from
the
moment
i
cease
to
care
for
you
i
also
cease
to
be
afraid
of
you
improve
your
manners
improve
your
mind
and
we
will
very
good
i
said
that
is
a
promise
i
can
understand
i
will
act
on
it
and
if
i
can
not
be
happy
i
will
have
my
take
your
revenge
as
much
as
you
please
she
said
that
will
only
make
me
despise
so
saying
she
drew
from
her
bosom
a
piece
of
paper
and
burnt
it
in
the
flame
of
her
candle
what
are
you
doing
i
exclaimed
i
am
burning
a
letter
i
had
written
to
you
she
answered
i
wanted
to
make
you
listen
to
reason
but
it
is
quite
useless
one
can
not
reason
with
give
me
that
letter
at
once
i
cried
rushing
at
her
to
seize
the
burning
paper
but
she
withdrew
it
quickly
and
fearlessly
extinguishing
it
in
her
hand
threw
the
candle
at
my
feet
and
fled
in
the
darkness
i
ran
after
her
but
in
vain
she
was
in
her
room
before
i
could
get
there
and
had
slammed
the
door
and
drawn
the
bolts
i
could
hear
the
voice
of
mademoiselle
leblanc
asking
her
young
mistress
the
cause
of
her
fright
it
is
nothing
replied
edmee
s
trembling
voice
nothing
but
a
i
went
into
the
garden
and
strode
up
and
down
the
walks
at
a
furious
rate
my
anger
gave
place
to
the
most
profound
melancholy
edmee
proud
and
daring
seemed
to
me
more
desirable
than
ever
it
is
the
nature
of
all
desire
to
be
excited
and
nourished
by
opposition
i
felt
that
i
had
offended
her
and
that
she
did
not
love
me
that
perhaps
she
would
never
love
me
and
without
abandoning
my
criminal
resolution
to
make
her
mine
by
force
i
gave
way
to
grief
at
the
thought
of
her
hatred
of
me
i
went
and
leaned
upon
a
gloomy
old
wall
which
happened
to
be
near
and
burying
my
face
in
my
hands
i
broke
into
sobs
my
sturdy
breast
heaved
convulsively
but
tears
would
not
bring
the
relief
i
longed
for
i
could
have
roared
in
my
anguish
and
i
had
to
bite
my
handkerchief
to
prevent
myself
from
yielding
to
the
temptation
the
weird
noise
of
my
stifled
sobs
attracted
the
attention
of
some
one
who
was
praying
in
the
little
chapel
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
which
i
had
chanced
to
lean
against
a
gothic
window
with
its
stone
mullions
surmounted
by
a
trefoil
was
exactly
on
a
level
with
my
head
who
is
there
asked
some
one
and
i
could
distinguish
a
pale
face
in
the
slanting
rays
of
the
moon
which
was
just
rising
it
was
edmee
on
recognising
her
i
was
about
to
move
away
but
she
passed
her
beautiful
arm
between
the
mullions
and
held
me
back
by
the
collar
of
my
jacket
saying
why
are
you
crying
bernard
i
yielded
to
her
gentle
violence
half
ashamed
at
having
betrayed
my
weakness
and
half
enchanted
at
finding
that
edmee
was
not
unmoved
by
it
what
are
you
grieved
at
she
continued
what
can
draw
such
bitter
tears
from
you
you
despise
me
you
hate
me
and
you
ask
why
i
am
in
pain
why
i
am
angry
it
is
anger
then
that
makes
you
weep
she
said
drawing
back
her
arm
yes
anger
or
something
else
i
replied
but
what
else
she
asked
i
can
t
say
probably
grief
as
you
suggest
the
truth
is
my
life
here
is
unbearable
my
heart
is
breaking
i
must
leave
you
edmee
and
go
and
live
in
the
middle
of
the
woods
i
can
not
stay
here
any
why
is
life
unbearable
explain
yourself
bernard
now
is
our
opportunity
for
an
yes
with
a
wall
between
us
i
can
understand
that
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
only
showing
an
interest
in
you
and
was
i
not
as
affectionate
an
hour
ago
when
there
was
no
wall
between
us
i
begin
to
see
why
you
are
fearless
edmee
you
always
find
some
means
of
avoiding
people
or
of
winning
them
over
with
pretty
words
ah
they
were
right
when
they
told
me
that
all
women
are
false
and
that
i
must
love
none
of
and
who
told
you
that
your
uncle
john
i
suppose
or
your
uncle
walter
or
was
it
your
grandfather
tristan
you
can
jeer
jeer
at
me
as
much
as
you
like
it
is
not
my
fault
that
i
was
brought
up
by
them
there
were
times
however
when
they
spoke
the
bernard
would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
why
they
thought
women
false
yes
tell
because
they
were
brutes
and
tyrants
to
creatures
weaker
than
themselves
whenever
one
makes
one
s
self
feared
one
runs
the
risk
of
being
deceived
in
your
childhood
when
john
used
to
beat
you
did
you
never
try
to
escape
his
brutal
punishment
by
disguising
your
little
faults
i
did
that
was
my
only
you
can
understand
then
that
deception
is
if
not
the
right
at
least
the
resource
of
the
i
understand
that
i
love
you
and
in
that
at
any
rate
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
your
deceiving
and
who
says
that
i
have
deceived
you
but
you
have
you
said
you
loved
me
you
did
not
love
i
loved
you
because
at
a
time
when
you
were
wavering
between
detestable
principles
and
the
impulses
of
a
generous
heart
i
saw
that
you
were
inclining
towards
justice
and
honesty
and
i
love
you
now
because
i
see
that
you
are
triumphing
over
these
vile
principles
and
that
your
evil
inspirations
are
followed
by
tears
of
honest
regret
this
i
say
before
god
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
at
a
time
when
i
can
see
your
real
self
there
are
other
times
when
you
appear
to
me
so
below
yourself
that
i
no
longer
recognise
you
and
i
think
i
no
longer
love
you
it
rests
with
you
bernard
to
free
me
from
all
doubts
either
about
you
or
and
what
must
i
do
you
must
amend
your
bad
habits
open
your
ears
to
good
counsel
and
your
heart
to
the
precepts
of
morality
you
are
a
savage
bernard
and
believe
me
it
is
neither
your
awkwardness
in
making
a
bow
nor
your
inability
to
turn
a
compliment
that
shocks
me
on
the
contrary
this
roughness
of
manner
would
be
a
very
great
charm
in
my
eyes
if
only
there
were
some
great
ideas
and
noble
feelings
beneath
it
but
your
ideas
and
your
feelings
are
like
your
manners
that
is
what
i
can
not
endure
i
know
it
is
not
your
fault
and
if
i
only
saw
you
resolute
to
improve
i
should
love
you
as
much
for
your
defects
as
for
your
qualities
compassion
brings
affection
in
its
train
but
i
do
not
love
evil
i
never
loved
it
and
if
you
cultivate
it
in
yourself
instead
of
uprooting
it
i
can
never
love
you
do
you
understand
me
what
no
no
i
say
i
am
not
aware
that
there
is
any
evil
in
me
if
you
are
not
displeased
at
the
lack
of
grace
in
my
legs
or
the
lack
of
whiteness
in
my
hands
or
the
lack
of
elegance
in
my
words
i
fail
to
see
what
you
find
to
hate
in
me
from
my
childhood
i
have
had
to
listen
to
evil
precepts
but
i
have
not
accepted
them
i
have
never
considered
it
permissible
to
do
a
bad
deed
or
at
least
i
have
never
found
it
pleasurable
if
i
have
done
wrong
it
is
because
i
have
been
forced
to
do
it
i
have
always
detested
my
uncles
and
their
ways
i
do
not
like
to
see
others
suffer
i
do
not
rob
a
i
despise
money
of
which
they
made
a
god
at
i
know
how
to
keep
sober
and
though
i
am
fond
of
wine
i
would
drink
water
all
my
life
if
like
my
uncles
i
had
to
shed
blood
to
get
a
good
supper
yet
i
fought
for
them
yet
i
drank
with
them
how
could
i
do
otherwise
but
now
when
i
am
my
own
master
what
harm
am
i
doing
does
your
abbe
who
is
always
prating
of
virtue
take
me
for
a
murderer
or
a
thief
come
edmee
confess
now
you
know
well
enough
that
i
am
an
honest
man
you
do
not
really
think
me
wicked
but
i
am
displeasing
to
you
because
i
am
not
clever
and
you
like
de
la
marche
because
he
has
a
knack
of
making
unmeaning
speeches
which
i
should
blush
to
and
if
to
be
pleasing
to
me
she
said
with
a
smile
after
listening
most
attentively
and
without
withdrawing
her
hand
which
i
had
taken
through
the
bars
if
in
order
to
be
preferred
to
de
la
marche
it
were
necessary
to
acquire
more
wit
as
you
say
would
you
not
try
i
don
t
know
i
replied
after
hesitating
a
moment
perhaps
i
should
be
fool
enough
for
the
power
you
have
over
me
is
more
than
i
can
understand
but
it
would
be
a
sorry
piece
of
cowardice
and
a
great
why
bernard
because
a
woman
who
could
love
a
man
not
for
his
honest
heart
but
for
his
pretty
wit
would
be
hardly
worth
the
pains
i
should
have
to
take
at
least
so
it
seems
to
she
remained
silent
in
her
turn
and
then
said
to
me
as
she
pressed
my
hand
you
have
much
more
sense
and
wit
than
one
might
think
and
since
you
force
me
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
i
will
own
that
as
you
now
are
and
even
should
you
never
change
i
have
an
esteem
and
an
affection
for
you
which
will
last
as
long
as
my
life
rest
assured
of
that
bernard
whatever
i
may
say
in
a
moment
of
anger
you
know
i
have
a
quick
temper
that
runs
in
the
family
the
blood
of
the
mauprats
will
never
flow
as
smoothly
as
other
people
s
have
a
care
for
my
pride
then
you
know
so
well
what
pride
is
and
do
not
ever
presume
upon
rights
you
have
acquired
affection
can
not
be
commanded
it
must
be
implored
or
inspired
act
so
that
i
may
always
love
you
never
tell
me
that
i
am
forced
to
love
that
is
reasonable
enough
i
answered
but
why
do
you
sometimes
speak
to
me
as
if
i
were
forced
to
obey
you
why
for
instance
this
evening
did
you
me
to
drink
and
me
to
study
because
if
one
can
not
command
affection
which
does
not
exist
one
can
at
least
command
affection
which
does
exist
and
it
is
because
i
am
sure
yours
exists
that
i
commanded
good
i
cried
in
a
transport
of
joy
i
have
a
right
then
to
order
yours
also
since
you
have
told
me
that
it
certainly
exists
edmee
i
order
you
to
kiss
let
go
bernard
she
cried
you
are
breaking
my
arm
look
you
have
scraped
it
against
the
why
have
you
intrenched
yourself
against
me
i
said
putting
my
lips
to
the
little
scratch
i
had
made
on
her
arm
ah
woe
is
me
confound
the
bars
edmee
if
you
would
only
bend
your
head
down
i
should
be
able
to
kiss
you
kiss
you
as
my
sister
edmee
what
are
you
afraid
of
my
good
bernard
she
replied
in
the
world
in
which
i
live
one
does
not
kiss
even
a
sister
and
nowhere
does
one
kiss
in
secret
i
will
kiss
you
every
day
before
my
father
if
you
like
but
never
you
will
never
kiss
me
i
cried
relapsing
into
my
usual
passion
what
of
your
promise
what
of
my
rights
if
we
marry
she
said
in
an
embarrassed
tone
when
you
have
received
the
education
i
implore
you
to
receive
death
of
my
life
is
this
a
jest
is
there
any
question
of
marriage
between
us
none
at
all
i
don
t
want
your
fortune
as
i
have
told
my
fortune
and
yours
are
one
she
replied
bernard
between
near
relations
as
we
are
mine
and
thine
are
words
without
meaning
i
should
never
suspect
you
of
being
mercenary
i
know
that
you
love
me
that
you
will
work
to
give
me
proof
of
this
and
that
a
day
will
come
when
your
love
will
no
longer
make
me
fear
because
i
shall
be
able
to
accept
it
in
the
face
of
heaven
and
if
that
is
your
idea
i
replied
completely
drawn
away
from
my
wild
passion
by
the
new
turn
she
was
giving
to
my
thoughts
my
position
is
very
different
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
must
reflect
on
this
i
had
not
realized
that
this
was
your
and
how
should
i
have
meant
otherwise
she
answered
is
not
a
woman
dishonoured
by
giving
herself
to
a
man
who
is
not
her
husband
i
do
not
wish
to
dishonour
myself
and
since
you
love
me
you
would
not
wish
it
either
you
would
not
do
me
an
irreparable
wrong
if
such
were
your
intention
you
would
be
my
deadliest
stay
edmee
stay
i
answered
i
can
tell
you
nothing
about
my
intentions
in
regard
to
you
for
i
have
never
had
any
very
definite
i
have
felt
nothing
but
wild
desires
nor
have
i
ever
thought
of
you
without
going
mad
you
wish
me
to
marry
you
but
why
why
because
a
girl
who
respects
herself
can
not
be
any
man
s
except
with
the
thought
with
the
intention
with
the
certainty
of
being
his
forever
do
you
not
know
that
there
are
so
many
things
i
do
not
know
or
have
never
thought
education
will
teach
you
bernard
what
you
ought
to
think
about
the
things
which
must
concern
you
about
your
position
your
duties
your
feelings
at
present
you
see
but
dimly
into
your
heart
and
conscience
and
i
who
am
accustomed
to
question
myself
on
all
subjects
and
to
discipline
my
life
how
can
i
take
for
master
a
man
governed
by
instinct
and
guided
by
chance
for
master
for
husband
yes
i
understand
that
you
can
not
surrender
your
whole
life
to
an
animal
such
as
myself
but
that
is
what
i
have
never
asked
of
you
no
i
tremble
to
think
of
and
yet
bernard
you
must
think
of
it
think
of
it
frequently
and
when
you
have
done
so
you
will
realize
the
necessity
of
following
my
advice
and
of
bringing
your
mind
into
harmony
with
the
new
life
upon
which
you
have
entered
since
quitting
when
you
have
perceived
this
necessity
you
must
tell
me
and
then
we
will
make
several
necessary
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
mine
quickly
and
i
fancy
she
bade
me
but
this
i
did
not
hear
i
stood
buried
in
my
thoughts
and
when
i
raised
my
head
to
speak
to
her
she
was
no
longer
there
i
went
into
the
chapel
but
she
had
returned
to
her
room
by
an
upper
gallery
which
communicated
with
her
apartments
i
went
back
into
the
garden
walked
far
into
the
park
and
remained
there
all
night
this
conversation
with
edmee
had
opened
a
new
world
to
me
hitherto
i
had
not
ceased
to
be
the
man
nor
had
i
ever
contemplated
that
it
was
possible
or
desirable
to
cease
to
be
so
except
for
some
habits
which
had
changed
with
circumstances
i
had
never
moved
out
of
the
narrow
circle
of
my
old
thoughts
i
felt
annoyed
that
these
new
surroundings
of
mine
should
have
any
real
power
over
me
and
i
secretly
braced
my
will
so
that
i
should
not
be
humbled
such
was
my
perseverance
and
strength
of
character
that
i
believed
nothing
would
ever
have
driven
me
from
my
intrenchment
of
obstinacy
had
not
edmee
s
influence
been
brought
to
bear
upon
me
the
vulgar
comforts
of
life
the
satisfactions
of
luxury
had
no
attraction
for
me
beyond
their
novelty
bodily
repose
was
a
burden
to
me
and
the
calm
that
reigned
in
this
house
so
full
of
order
and
silence
would
have
been
unbearable
had
not
edmee
s
presence
and
the
tumult
of
my
own
desires
communicated
to
it
some
of
my
disorder
and
peopled
it
with
some
of
my
visions
never
for
a
single
moment
had
i
desired
to
become
the
head
of
this
house
the
possessor
of
this
property
and
it
was
with
genuine
pleasure
that
i
had
just
heard
edmee
do
justice
to
my
disinterestedness
the
thought
of
coupling
two
ends
so
entirely
distinct
as
my
passion
and
my
interests
was
still
more
repugnant
to
me
i
roamed
about
the
park
a
prey
to
a
thousand
doubts
and
then
wandered
into
the
open
country
unconsciously
it
was
a
glorious
night
the
full
moon
was
pouring
down
floods
of
soft
light
upon
the
ploughed
lands
all
parched
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
thirsty
plants
were
straightening
their
bowed
stems
each
leaf
seemed
to
be
drinking
in
through
all
its
pores
all
the
dewy
freshness
of
the
night
i
too
began
to
feel
a
soothing
influence
at
work
my
heart
was
still
beating
violently
but
regularly
i
was
filled
with
a
vague
hope
the
image
of
edmee
floated
before
me
on
the
paths
through
the
meadows
and
no
longer
stirred
the
wild
agonies
and
frenzied
desires
which
had
been
devouring
me
since
the
night
i
first
beheld
her
i
was
crossing
a
spot
where
the
green
stretches
of
pasture
were
here
and
there
broken
by
clumps
of
young
trees
huge
oxen
with
almost
white
skins
were
lying
in
the
short
grass
motionless
as
if
plunged
in
peaceful
thought
hills
sloped
gently
up
to
the
horizon
and
their
velvety
contours
seemed
to
ripple
in
the
bright
rays
of
the
moon
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
realized
something
of
the
voluptuous
beauty
and
divine
effluence
of
the
night
i
felt
the
magic
touch
of
some
unknown
bliss
it
seemed
that
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
looking
on
moon
and
meadows
and
hills
i
remembered
hearing
edmee
say
that
nothing
our
eyes
can
behold
is
more
lovely
than
nature
and
i
was
astonished
that
i
had
never
felt
this
before
now
and
them
i
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
myself
on
my
knees
and
praying
to
god
but
i
feared
that
i
should
not
know
how
to
speak
to
him
and
that
i
might
offend
him
by
praying
badly
shall
i
confess
to
you
a
singular
fancy
that
came
upon
me
a
childish
revelation
as
it
were
of
poetic
love
from
out
of
the
chaos
of
my
ignorance
the
moon
was
lighting
up
everything
so
plainly
that
i
could
distinguish
the
tiniest
flowers
in
the
grass
a
little
meadow
daisy
seemed
to
me
so
beautiful
with
its
golden
calyx
full
of
diamonds
of
dew
and
its
white
collaret
fringed
with
purple
that
i
plucked
it
and
covered
it
with
kisses
and
cried
in
a
sort
of
delirious
intoxication
it
is
you
edmee
yes
it
is
you
ah
you
no
longer
shun
me
but
what
was
my
confusion
when
on
rising
i
found
there
had
been
a
witness
of
my
folly
patience
was
standing
before
me
i
was
so
angry
at
having
been
surprised
in
such
a
fit
of
extravagance
that
from
a
remnant
of
the
hamstringer
instinct
i
immediately
felt
for
a
knife
in
my
belt
but
neither
belt
nor
knife
was
there
my
silk
waistcoat
with
its
pocket
reminded
me
that
i
was
doomed
to
cut
no
more
throats
patience
smiled
well
well
what
is
the
matter
said
the
anchorite
in
a
calm
and
kindly
tone
do
you
imagine
that
i
don
t
know
perfectly
well
how
things
stand
i
am
not
so
simple
but
that
i
can
reason
i
am
not
so
old
but
that
i
can
see
who
is
it
that
makes
the
branches
of
my
yew
shake
whenever
the
holy
maiden
is
sitting
at
my
door
who
is
it
that
follows
us
like
a
young
wolf
with
measured
steps
through
the
copse
when
i
take
the
lovely
child
to
her
father
and
what
harm
is
there
in
it
you
are
both
young
you
are
both
handsome
you
are
of
the
same
family
and
if
you
chose
you
might
become
a
noble
and
honest
man
as
she
is
a
noble
and
honest
all
my
wrath
had
vanished
as
i
listened
to
patience
speaking
of
edmee
i
had
such
a
vast
longing
to
talk
about
her
that
i
would
even
have
been
willing
to
have
heard
evil
spoken
of
her
for
the
sole
pleasure
of
hearing
her
name
pronounced
i
continued
my
walk
by
the
side
of
patience
the
old
man
was
tramping
through
the
dew
with
bare
feet
it
should
be
mentioned
however
that
his
feet
had
long
been
unacquainted
with
any
covering
and
had
attained
a
degree
of
callosity
that
rendered
them
proof
against
anything
his
only
garments
were
a
pair
of
blue
canvas
breeches
which
in
the
absence
of
braces
hung
loosely
from
his
hips
and
a
coarse
shirt
he
could
not
endure
any
constraint
in
his
clothes
and
his
skin
hardened
by
exposure
was
sensitive
to
neither
heat
nor
cold
even
when
over
eighty
he
was
accustomed
to
go
bareheaded
in
the
broiling
sun
and
with
shirt
in
the
winter
blasts
since
edmee
had
seen
to
his
wants
he
had
attained
a
certain
cleanliness
nevertheless
in
the
disorder
of
his
toilet
and
his
hatred
of
everything
that
passed
the
bounds
of
the
strictest
necessity
though
he
could
not
have
been
charged
with
immodesty
which
had
always
been
odious
to
him
the
cynic
of
the
old
days
was
still
apparent
his
beard
was
shining
like
silver
his
bald
skull
was
so
polished
that
the
moon
was
reflected
in
it
as
in
water
he
walked
slowly
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
head
raised
like
a
man
who
is
surveying
his
empire
but
most
frequently
his
glances
were
thrown
skywards
and
he
interrupted
his
conversation
to
point
to
the
starry
vault
and
exclaim
look
at
that
look
how
beautiful
it
is
he
is
the
only
peasant
i
have
ever
known
to
admire
the
sky
or
at
least
he
is
the
only
one
i
have
ever
seen
who
was
conscious
of
his
admiration
why
master
patience
i
said
to
him
do
you
think
i
might
be
an
honest
man
if
i
chose
do
you
think
that
i
am
not
one
already
oh
do
not
be
angry
he
answered
patience
is
privileged
to
say
anything
is
he
not
the
fool
of
the
chateau
on
the
contrary
edmee
maintains
that
you
are
its
does
the
holy
child
of
god
say
that
well
if
she
believes
so
i
will
try
to
act
as
a
wise
man
and
give
you
some
good
advice
master
bernard
mauprat
will
you
accept
it
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
place
every
one
takes
upon
himself
to
give
advice
never
mind
i
am
you
are
in
love
with
your
cousin
are
you
not
you
are
very
bold
to
ask
such
a
it
is
not
a
question
it
is
a
fact
well
my
advice
is
this
make
your
cousin
love
you
and
become
her
and
why
do
you
take
this
interest
in
me
master
patience
because
i
know
you
deserve
who
told
you
so
the
abbe
edmee
partly
and
yet
she
is
certainly
not
very
much
in
love
with
you
but
it
is
your
own
how
so
patience
because
she
wants
you
to
become
clever
and
you
you
would
rather
not
oh
if
i
were
only
your
age
yes
i
poor
patience
and
if
i
were
able
without
feeling
stifled
to
shut
myself
up
in
a
room
for
only
two
hours
a
day
and
if
all
those
i
met
were
anxious
to
teach
me
if
they
said
to
me
patience
this
is
what
was
done
yesterday
patience
this
is
what
will
be
done
but
enough
i
have
to
find
out
everything
myself
and
there
is
so
much
that
i
shall
die
of
old
age
before
finding
out
a
tenth
part
of
what
i
should
like
to
know
but
listen
i
have
yet
another
reason
for
wishing
you
to
marry
what
is
that
good
monsieur
patience
this
la
marche
is
not
the
right
man
for
her
i
have
told
her
so
yes
i
have
and
himself
too
and
the
abbe
and
everybody
he
is
not
a
man
that
thing
he
smells
as
sweet
as
a
whole
but
i
prefer
the
tiniest
sprig
of
wild
faith
i
have
but
little
love
for
him
myself
but
if
my
cousin
likes
him
what
then
patience
your
cousin
does
not
like
him
she
thinks
he
is
a
good
man
she
thinks
him
genuine
she
is
mistaken
he
deceives
her
as
he
deceives
everybody
yes
i
know
he
is
a
man
who
has
not
any
of
this
and
patience
put
his
hand
to
his
heart
he
is
a
man
who
is
always
proclaiming
in
me
behold
the
champion
of
virtue
the
champion
of
the
unfortunate
the
champion
of
all
the
wise
men
and
friends
of
the
human
race
while
i
patience
i
know
that
he
lets
poor
folk
die
of
hunger
at
the
gates
of
his
chateau
i
know
that
if
any
one
said
to
him
give
up
your
castle
and
eat
black
bread
give
up
your
lands
and
become
a
soldier
and
then
there
will
be
no
more
misery
in
the
world
the
human
race
as
you
call
it
will
be
saved
his
real
self
would
answer
thanks
i
am
lord
of
my
lands
and
i
am
not
yet
tired
of
my
oh
i
know
them
so
well
these
sham
paragons
how
different
with
edmee
you
do
not
know
that
you
love
her
because
she
is
as
beautiful
as
the
daisy
in
the
meadows
while
i
i
love
her
because
she
is
good
as
the
moon
that
sheds
light
on
all
she
is
a
girl
who
gives
away
everything
that
she
has
who
would
not
wear
a
jewel
because
with
the
gold
in
a
ring
a
man
could
be
kept
alive
for
a
year
and
if
she
finds
a
child
by
the
she
takes
off
her
shoes
and
gives
them
to
him
and
goes
on
her
way
then
look
you
hers
is
a
heart
that
never
swerves
if
the
village
of
were
to
go
to
her
in
a
body
and
say
young
lady
you
have
lived
long
enough
in
the
lap
of
wealth
give
us
what
you
have
and
take
your
turn
at
work
that
is
but
fair
my
good
friends
she
would
reply
and
with
a
glad
heart
she
would
go
and
tend
the
flocks
in
the
fields
her
mother
was
the
same
i
knew
her
mother
when
she
was
quite
young
young
as
yourself
and
i
knew
yours
too
oh
yes
she
was
a
lady
with
a
noble
mind
charitable
and
just
to
all
and
you
take
after
her
they
alas
no
i
answered
deeply
touched
by
these
words
of
patience
i
know
neither
charity
nor
you
have
not
been
able
to
practise
them
yet
but
they
are
written
in
your
heart
i
can
read
them
there
people
call
me
a
sorcerer
and
so
i
am
in
a
measure
i
know
a
man
directly
i
see
him
do
you
remember
what
you
said
to
me
one
day
on
the
heath
at
valide
you
were
with
sylvain
and
i
with
marcasse
you
told
me
that
an
honest
man
avenges
his
wrongs
himself
and
monsieur
mauprat
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
the
apologies
i
made
you
at
gazeau
tower
you
may
say
so
see
there
is
no
one
near
and
old
as
i
am
i
have
still
a
fist
as
good
as
yours
we
can
exchange
a
few
healthy
blows
that
is
nature
s
way
and
though
i
do
not
approve
of
it
i
never
refuse
satisfaction
to
any
one
who
demands
it
there
are
some
men
i
know
who
would
die
of
mortification
if
they
did
not
have
their
revenge
and
it
has
taken
me
yes
the
man
you
see
before
you
more
than
fifty
years
to
forget
an
insult
i
once
received
and
even
now
whenever
i
think
of
it
my
hatred
of
the
nobles
springs
up
again
and
i
hold
it
as
a
crime
to
have
let
my
heart
forgive
some
of
i
am
fully
satisfied
master
patience
and
in
truth
i
now
feel
nothing
but
affection
for
ah
that
comes
of
my
scratching
your
back
youth
is
ever
generous
come
mauprat
take
courage
follow
the
abbe
s
advice
he
is
a
good
man
try
to
please
your
cousin
she
is
a
star
in
the
firmament
find
out
truth
love
the
people
hate
those
who
hate
them
be
ready
to
sacrifice
yourself
for
them
yes
one
word
more
listen
i
know
what
i
am
saying
become
the
people
s
is
the
people
then
better
than
the
nobility
patience
come
now
honestly
since
you
are
a
wise
man
tell
me
the
ay
we
are
worth
more
than
the
nobles
because
they
trample
us
under
foot
and
we
let
them
but
we
shall
not
always
bear
this
perhaps
no
you
will
have
to
know
it
sooner
or
later
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
now
you
see
yonder
stars
they
will
never
change
ten
thousand
years
hence
they
will
be
in
the
same
place
and
be
giving
forth
as
much
light
as
but
within
the
next
hundred
years
maybe
within
less
there
will
be
many
a
change
on
this
earth
take
the
word
of
a
man
who
has
an
eye
for
the
truth
of
things
and
does
not
let
himself
be
led
astray
by
the
fine
airs
of
the
great
the
poor
have
suffered
enough
they
will
turn
upon
the
rich
and
their
castles
will
fail
and
their
lands
be
carved
up
i
shall
not
see
it
but
you
will
there
will
be
ten
cottages
in
the
place
of
this
park
and
ten
families
will
live
on
its
revenue
there
will
no
longer
be
servants
or
masters
or
villein
or
lord
some
nobles
will
cry
aloud
and
yield
only
to
force
as
your
uncles
would
do
if
they
were
alive
and
as
de
la
marche
will
do
in
spite
of
all
his
fine
talk
others
will
sacrifice
themselves
generously
like
edmee
and
like
yourself
if
you
listen
to
wisdom
and
in
that
hour
it
will
be
well
for
edmee
that
her
husband
is
a
man
and
not
a
mere
fop
it
will
be
well
for
bernard
mauprat
that
he
knows
how
to
drive
a
plough
or
kill
the
game
which
the
good
god
has
sent
to
feed
his
family
for
old
patience
will
then
be
lying
under
the
grass
in
the
churchyard
unable
to
return
the
services
which
edmee
has
done
him
do
not
laugh
at
what
i
say
young
man
it
is
the
voice
of
god
that
is
speaking
look
at
the
heavens
the
stars
live
in
peace
and
nothing
disturbs
their
eternal
order
the
great
do
not
devour
the
small
and
none
fling
themselves
upon
their
neighbours
now
a
day
will
come
when
the
same
order
will
reign
among
men
the
wicked
will
be
swept
away
by
the
breath
of
the
lord
strengthen
your
legs
seigneur
mauprat
that
you
may
stand
firm
to
support
edmee
it
is
patience
that
warns
you
patience
who
wishes
you
naught
but
good
but
there
will
come
others
who
wish
you
ill
and
the
good
must
make
themselves
we
had
reached
patience
s
cottage
he
had
stopped
at
the
gate
of
his
little
inclosure
resting
one
hand
on
the
and
waving
the
other
as
he
spoke
his
voice
was
full
of
passion
his
eyes
flashed
fire
and
his
brow
was
bathed
in
sweat
there
seemed
to
be
some
weird
power
in
his
words
as
in
those
of
the
prophets
of
old
the
more
than
plebeian
simplicity
of
his
dress
still
further
increased
the
pride
of
his
gestures
and
the
impressiveness
of
his
voice
the
french
revolution
has
shown
since
that
in
the
ranks
of
the
people
there
was
no
lack
of
eloquence
or
of
pitiless
logic
but
what
i
saw
at
that
moment
was
so
novel
and
made
such
an
impression
on
me
that
my
unruly
and
unbridled
imagination
was
carried
away
by
the
superstitious
terrors
of
childhood
he
held
out
his
hand
and
i
responded
with
more
of
terror
than
affection
the
sorcerer
of
gazeau
tower
hanging
the
bleeding
owl
above
my
head
had
just
risen
before
my
eyes
again
xi
when
i
awoke
on
the
morrow
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
all
the
incidents
of
the
previous
night
appeared
to
me
as
a
dream
i
began
to
think
that
edmee
s
suggestion
of
becoming
my
wife
had
been
a
perfidious
trick
to
put
off
my
hopes
indefinitely
and
as
to
the
sorcerer
s
words
i
could
not
recall
them
without
a
feeling
of
profound
humiliation
still
they
had
produced
their
effect
my
emotions
had
left
traces
which
could
never
be
effaced
i
was
no
longer
the
man
of
the
day
before
and
never
again
was
i
to
be
quite
the
man
of
it
was
late
for
not
until
morning
had
i
attempted
to
make
good
my
sleepless
night
i
was
still
in
bed
when
i
heard
the
hoofs
of
de
la
marche
s
horse
on
the
stones
of
the
courtyard
every
day
he
used
to
come
at
this
hour
every
day
he
used
to
see
edmee
at
the
same
time
as
myself
and
now
on
this
very
day
this
day
when
she
had
tried
to
persuade
me
to
reckon
on
her
hand
he
was
going
to
see
her
before
me
and
to
give
his
soulless
kiss
to
this
hand
that
had
been
promised
to
myself
the
thought
of
it
stirred
up
all
my
doubts
again
how
could
edmee
endure
his
attentions
if
she
really
meant
to
marry
another
man
perhaps
she
dared
not
send
him
away
perhaps
it
was
my
duty
to
do
so
i
was
ignorant
of
the
ways
of
the
world
into
which
i
was
entering
instinct
counselled
me
to
yield
to
my
hasty
impulses
and
instinct
spoke
loudly
i
hastily
dressed
myself
i
entered
the
pale
and
agitated
edmee
was
pale
too
it
was
a
cold
rainy
morning
a
fire
was
burning
in
the
great
lying
back
in
an
easy
chair
she
was
warming
her
little
feet
and
dozing
it
was
the
same
listless
almost
lifeless
attitude
of
the
days
of
her
illness
de
la
marche
was
reading
the
paper
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
on
seeing
that
edmee
was
more
affected
than
myself
by
the
emotions
of
the
previous
night
i
felt
my
anger
cool
and
approaching
her
noiselessly
i
sat
down
and
gazed
on
her
tenderly
is
that
you
bernard
she
asked
without
moving
a
limb
and
with
eyes
still
closed
her
elbows
were
resting
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
and
her
hands
were
gracefully
crossed
under
her
chin
at
that
period
it
was
the
fashion
for
women
to
have
their
arms
half
bare
at
all
times
on
one
of
edmee
s
i
noticed
a
little
strip
of
that
made
my
heart
beat
it
was
the
slight
scratch
i
had
caused
against
the
bars
of
the
chapel
window
i
gently
lifted
the
lace
which
fell
over
her
elbow
and
emboldened
by
her
drowsiness
pressed
my
lips
to
the
darling
wound
de
la
marche
could
see
me
and
in
fact
did
see
me
as
i
intended
he
should
i
was
burning
to
have
a
quarrel
with
him
edmee
started
and
turned
red
but
immediately
assuming
an
air
of
indolent
playfulness
she
said
really
bernard
you
are
as
gallant
this
morning
as
a
court
abbe
do
you
happen
to
have
been
composing
a
madrigal
last
night
i
was
peculiarly
mortified
at
this
jesting
however
paying
her
back
in
her
own
coin
i
answered
yes
i
composed
one
yesterday
evening
at
the
chapel
window
and
if
it
is
a
poor
thing
cousin
it
is
your
say
rather
that
it
is
the
fault
of
your
education
she
replied
kindling
and
she
was
never
more
beautiful
than
when
her
natural
pride
and
spirit
were
roused
my
own
opinion
is
that
i
am
being
very
much
i
answered
and
that
if
i
gave
more
heed
to
my
natural
good
sense
you
would
not
jeer
at
me
so
really
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
indulging
in
a
veritable
war
of
wits
with
bernard
said
de
la
marche
folding
his
paper
carelessly
and
approaching
us
i
cry
quits
with
her
i
answered
annoyed
at
this
impertinence
let
her
keep
her
wit
for
such
as
i
had
risen
to
insult
him
but
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
and
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
he
bent
down
towards
edmee
and
said
in
a
gentle
and
almost
affectionate
voice
what
is
the
matter
with
him
as
if
he
were
inquiring
after
the
health
of
her
little
dog
how
should
i
know
she
replied
in
the
same
tone
then
she
rose
and
added
my
head
aches
too
much
to
remain
here
give
me
your
arm
and
take
me
up
to
my
she
went
out
leaning
upon
his
arm
i
was
left
there
stupefied
i
remained
in
the
resolved
to
insult
him
as
soon
as
he
should
return
but
the
abbe
now
entered
and
soon
afterward
my
uncle
hubert
they
began
to
talk
on
subjects
which
were
quite
strange
to
me
the
subjects
of
their
conversation
were
nearly
always
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
to
obtain
revenge
i
dared
not
betray
myself
in
my
uncle
s
presence
i
was
sensible
to
the
respect
i
owed
to
him
and
to
his
hospitality
never
had
i
done
such
violence
to
myself
at
yet
in
spite
of
all
efforts
my
anger
showed
itself
i
almost
died
at
being
obliged
to
wait
for
revenge
several
times
the
chevalier
noticed
the
change
in
my
features
and
asked
in
a
kind
tone
if
i
were
de
la
marche
seemed
neither
to
observe
nor
to
guess
anything
the
abbe
alone
examined
me
attentively
more
than
once
i
caught
his
blue
eyes
anxiously
fixed
on
me
those
eyes
in
which
natural
penetration
was
always
veiled
by
habitual
shyness
the
abbe
did
not
like
me
i
could
easily
see
that
his
kindly
cheerful
manners
grew
cold
in
spite
of
himself
as
soon
as
he
spoke
to
me
and
i
noticed
too
that
his
face
would
invariably
assume
a
sad
expression
at
my
approach
the
constraint
that
i
was
enduring
was
so
alien
to
my
habits
and
so
beyond
my
strength
that
i
came
nigh
to
fainting
to
obtain
relief
i
went
and
threw
myself
on
the
grass
in
the
park
this
was
a
refuge
to
me
in
all
my
troubles
these
mighty
oaks
this
moss
which
had
clung
to
their
branches
through
the
centuries
these
pale
wild
flowers
emblems
of
secret
sorrow
these
were
the
friends
of
my
childhood
and
these
alone
i
had
found
the
same
in
social
as
in
savage
life
i
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
and
i
never
remember
having
suffered
more
in
any
of
the
calamities
of
my
life
though
some
that
i
had
to
bear
afterward
were
very
real
on
the
whole
i
ought
to
have
accounted
myself
lucky
on
giving
up
the
rough
and
perilous
trade
of
a
to
find
so
many
unexpected
blessings
affection
devotion
riches
liberty
education
good
precepts
and
good
examples
but
it
is
certain
that
in
order
to
pass
from
a
given
state
to
its
opposite
though
it
be
from
evil
to
good
from
grief
to
joy
from
fatigue
to
repose
the
soul
of
a
man
must
suffer
in
this
hour
of
birth
of
a
new
destiny
all
the
springs
of
his
being
are
strained
almost
to
breaking
even
as
at
the
approach
of
summer
the
sky
is
covered
with
dark
clouds
and
the
earth
all
seems
about
to
be
annihilated
by
the
tempest
at
this
moment
my
only
thought
was
to
devise
some
means
of
appeasing
my
hatred
of
de
la
marche
without
betraying
and
without
even
arousing
a
suspicion
of
the
mysterious
bond
which
held
edmee
in
my
power
though
nothing
was
less
respected
at
than
the
sanctity
of
an
oath
yet
the
little
reading
i
had
had
there
those
ballads
of
chivalry
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
had
filled
me
with
an
almost
romantic
love
of
good
faith
and
this
was
about
the
only
virtue
i
had
acquired
there
my
promise
of
secrecy
to
edmee
was
therefore
inviolable
in
my
eyes
however
i
said
to
myself
i
dare
say
i
shall
find
some
plausible
pretext
for
throwing
myself
upon
my
enemy
and
strangling
to
confess
the
truth
this
was
far
from
easy
with
a
man
who
seemed
bent
on
being
all
politeness
and
kindness
distracted
by
these
thoughts
i
forgot
the
dinner
hour
and
when
i
saw
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
turrets
of
the
castle
i
realized
too
late
that
my
absence
must
have
been
noticed
and
that
i
could
not
appear
without
submitting
to
edmee
s
searching
questions
and
to
the
abbe
s
cold
piercing
gaze
which
though
it
always
seemed
to
avoid
mine
i
would
suddenly
surprise
in
the
act
of
sounding
the
very
depths
of
my
conscience
i
resolved
not
to
return
to
the
house
till
nightfall
and
i
threw
myself
upon
the
grass
and
tried
to
find
rest
for
my
aching
head
in
sleep
i
did
fall
asleep
in
fact
when
i
awoke
the
moon
was
rising
in
the
heavens
which
were
still
red
with
the
glow
of
sunset
the
noise
which
had
aroused
me
was
very
slight
but
there
are
some
sounds
which
strike
the
heart
before
reaching
the
ear
and
the
subtlest
emanations
of
love
will
at
times
pierce
through
the
coarsest
organization
edmee
s
voice
had
just
pronounced
my
name
a
short
distance
away
behind
some
foliage
at
first
i
thought
i
had
been
dreaming
i
remained
where
i
was
held
my
breath
and
listened
it
was
she
on
her
way
to
the
hermit
s
in
company
with
the
abbe
they
had
stopped
in
a
covered
walk
five
or
six
yards
from
me
and
they
were
talking
in
low
voices
but
in
those
clear
tones
which
in
an
exchange
of
confidence
compels
attention
with
peculiar
solemnity
i
fear
edmee
was
saying
that
there
will
be
trouble
between
him
and
de
la
marche
perhaps
something
very
serious
who
knows
you
do
not
understand
he
must
be
got
away
from
here
at
all
costs
answered
the
abbe
you
can
not
live
in
this
way
continually
exposed
to
the
brutality
of
a
it
can
not
be
called
living
since
he
set
foot
in
the
house
i
have
not
had
a
moment
s
peace
of
mind
imprisoned
in
my
room
or
forced
to
seek
the
protection
of
my
friends
i
am
almost
afraid
to
move
it
is
as
much
as
i
dare
to
do
to
creep
downstairs
and
i
never
cross
the
corridor
without
sending
leblanc
ahead
as
a
scout
the
poor
woman
who
has
always
found
me
so
brave
now
thinks
i
am
mad
the
suspense
is
horrible
i
can
not
sleep
unless
i
first
bolt
the
door
and
look
abbe
i
never
walk
about
without
a
dagger
like
the
heroine
of
a
spanish
ballad
neither
more
nor
and
if
this
wretch
meets
you
and
frightens
you
you
will
plunge
it
into
your
bosom
oh
that
must
not
be
edmee
we
must
find
some
means
of
changing
a
position
which
is
no
longer
tenable
i
take
it
that
you
do
not
wish
to
deprive
him
of
your
father
s
friendship
by
confessing
to
the
latter
the
monstrous
bargain
you
were
forced
to
make
with
this
bandit
at
but
whatever
may
happen
ah
my
poor
little
edmee
i
am
not
a
bloodthirsty
man
but
twenty
times
a
day
i
find
myself
deploring
that
my
character
of
priest
prevents
me
from
challenging
this
creature
and
ridding
you
of
him
this
charitable
regret
expressed
so
artlessly
in
my
very
ear
made
me
itch
to
reveal
myself
to
them
at
once
were
it
only
to
put
the
abbe
s
warlike
humour
to
the
proof
but
i
was
restrained
by
the
hope
that
i
should
at
last
discover
edmee
s
real
feelings
and
real
intentions
in
regard
to
myself
have
no
fear
she
said
in
a
careless
tone
if
he
tries
my
patience
too
much
i
shall
not
have
the
slightest
hesitation
in
planting
this
blade
in
his
cheek
i
am
quite
sure
that
a
little
will
cool
his
then
they
drew
a
few
steps
nearer
listen
to
me
edmee
said
the
abbe
stopping
again
we
can
not
discuss
this
matter
with
patience
let
us
come
to
some
decision
before
we
put
it
aside
your
relations
with
bernard
are
now
drawing
to
a
crisis
it
seems
to
me
my
child
that
you
are
not
doing
all
you
ought
to
ward
off
the
evils
that
may
strike
us
for
everything
that
is
painful
to
you
will
be
painful
to
all
of
us
and
will
touch
us
to
the
bottom
of
our
i
am
all
attention
excellent
friend
answered
edmee
scold
me
advise
me
as
you
so
saying
she
leant
back
against
the
tree
at
the
foot
of
which
i
was
lying
among
the
brushwood
and
long
grass
i
fancy
she
might
have
seen
me
for
i
could
see
her
distinctly
however
she
little
thought
that
i
was
gazing
on
her
divine
face
over
which
the
night
breeze
was
throwing
now
the
shadows
of
the
rustling
leaves
and
now
the
pale
diamonds
that
the
moon
showers
down
through
the
trees
of
the
forest
my
opinion
edmee
answered
the
abbe
crossing
his
arms
on
his
breast
and
striking
his
brow
at
intervals
is
that
you
do
not
take
the
right
view
of
your
situation
at
times
it
distresses
you
to
such
an
extent
that
you
lose
all
hope
and
long
to
die
yes
my
dear
child
to
such
an
extent
that
your
health
plainly
suffers
at
other
times
and
i
must
speak
candidly
at
the
risk
of
offending
you
a
little
you
view
your
perils
with
a
levity
and
cheerfulness
that
astound
that
last
reproach
is
delicately
put
dear
friend
she
replied
but
allow
me
to
justify
myself
your
astonishment
arises
from
the
fact
that
you
do
not
know
the
mauprat
race
it
is
a
tameless
incorrigible
race
from
which
naught
but
headbreakers
and
hamstringers
may
issue
even
in
those
who
have
been
most
polished
by
education
there
remains
many
a
stubborn
knot
a
sovereign
pride
a
will
of
iron
a
profound
contempt
for
life
look
at
my
father
in
spite
of
his
adorable
goodness
you
see
that
he
is
sometimes
so
that
he
will
smash
his
on
the
table
when
you
get
the
better
of
him
in
some
political
argument
or
when
you
win
a
game
of
chess
for
myself
i
am
conscious
that
my
veins
are
as
as
if
i
had
been
born
in
the
noble
ranks
of
the
people
and
i
do
not
believe
that
any
mauprat
has
ever
shone
at
court
for
the
charm
of
his
manners
since
i
was
born
brave
how
would
you
have
me
set
much
store
by
life
and
yet
there
are
weak
moments
in
which
i
get
discouraged
more
than
enough
and
bemoan
my
fate
like
the
true
woman
that
i
am
but
let
some
one
offend
me
or
threaten
me
and
the
blood
of
the
strong
surges
through
me
again
and
then
as
i
can
not
crush
my
enemy
i
fold
my
arms
and
smile
with
compassion
at
the
idea
that
he
should
ever
have
hoped
to
frighten
me
and
do
not
look
upon
this
as
mere
bombast
abbe
this
evening
perhaps
my
words
may
turn
to
deeds
this
little
knife
does
not
look
like
deeds
of
blood
still
it
will
be
able
to
do
its
work
and
ever
since
don
marcasse
who
knows
what
he
is
about
sharpened
it
i
have
had
it
by
me
night
and
day
and
my
mind
is
made
up
i
have
not
a
very
strong
fist
but
it
will
no
doubt
manage
to
give
myself
a
good
stab
with
this
knife
even
as
it
manages
to
give
my
horse
a
cut
with
the
whip
well
that
being
so
my
honour
is
safe
it
is
only
my
life
which
hangs
by
a
thread
which
is
at
the
mercy
of
a
glass
of
wine
more
or
less
that
bernard
may
happen
to
drink
one
of
these
evenings
of
some
change
meeting
or
some
exchange
of
looks
between
de
la
marche
and
myself
that
he
may
fancy
he
has
detected
a
breath
of
air
perhaps
what
is
to
be
done
were
i
to
grieve
would
my
tears
wash
away
the
past
we
can
not
tear
out
a
single
page
of
our
lives
but
we
can
throw
the
book
into
the
fire
though
i
should
weep
from
night
till
morn
would
that
prevent
destiny
from
having
in
a
fit
of
taken
me
out
hunting
sent
me
astray
in
the
woods
and
made
me
stumble
across
a
mauprat
who
led
me
to
his
den
where
i
escaped
dishonour
and
perhaps
death
only
by
binding
my
life
forever
to
that
of
a
savage
who
had
none
of
my
principles
and
who
probably
and
who
undoubtedly
i
should
say
never
will
have
them
all
this
is
a
misfortune
i
was
in
the
full
sunlight
of
a
happy
destiny
i
was
the
pride
and
joy
of
my
old
father
i
was
about
to
marry
a
man
i
esteem
and
like
no
sorrows
no
fears
had
come
near
my
path
i
knew
neither
days
fraught
with
danger
nor
nights
bereft
of
sleep
well
god
did
not
wish
such
a
beautiful
life
to
continue
his
will
be
done
there
are
days
when
the
ruin
of
all
my
hopes
seems
to
me
so
inevitable
that
i
look
upon
myself
as
dead
and
my
as
a
widower
if
it
were
not
for
my
poor
father
i
should
really
laugh
at
it
all
for
i
am
so
ill
built
for
vexation
and
fears
that
during
the
short
time
i
have
known
them
they
have
already
tired
me
of
this
courage
is
heroic
but
it
is
also
terrible
cried
the
abbe
in
a
broken
voice
it
is
almost
a
resolve
to
commit
suicide
oh
i
shall
fight
for
my
life
she
answered
with
warmth
but
i
shall
not
stand
haggling
with
it
a
moment
if
my
honour
does
not
come
forth
safe
and
sound
from
all
these
risks
no
i
am
not
pious
enough
ever
to
accept
a
soiled
life
by
way
of
penance
for
sins
of
which
i
never
had
a
thought
if
god
deals
so
harshly
with
me
that
i
have
to
choose
between
shame
and
death
there
can
never
be
any
shame
for
you
edmee
a
soul
so
chaste
so
pure
in
intention
oh
don
t
talk
of
that
dear
abbe
perhaps
i
am
not
as
good
as
you
think
i
am
not
very
orthodox
in
religion
nor
are
you
abbe
i
give
little
heed
to
the
world
i
have
no
love
for
it
i
neither
fear
nor
despise
public
opinion
it
will
never
enter
into
my
life
i
am
not
very
sure
what
principle
of
virtue
would
be
strong
enough
to
prevent
me
from
falling
if
the
spirit
of
evil
took
me
in
hand
i
have
read
nouvelle
and
i
shed
many
tears
over
it
but
because
i
am
a
mauprat
and
have
an
unbending
pride
i
will
never
endure
the
tyranny
of
any
man
the
violence
of
a
lover
no
more
than
a
husband
s
blow
only
a
servile
soul
and
a
craven
character
may
yield
to
force
that
which
it
refuses
to
entreaty
sainte
solange
the
beautiful
shepherdess
let
her
head
be
cut
off
rather
than
submit
to
the
seigneur
s
rights
and
you
know
that
from
mother
to
daughter
the
mauprats
have
been
consecrated
in
baptism
to
the
protection
of
the
patron
saint
of
yes
i
know
that
you
are
proud
and
resolute
said
the
abbe
and
because
i
respect
you
more
than
any
woman
in
the
world
i
want
you
to
live
and
be
free
and
make
a
marriage
worthy
of
you
so
that
in
the
human
family
you
may
fill
the
part
which
beautiful
souls
still
know
how
to
make
noble
besides
you
are
necessary
to
your
father
your
death
would
hurry
him
to
his
grave
hearty
and
robust
as
the
mauprat
still
is
put
away
these
gloomy
thoughts
then
and
these
violent
resolutions
it
is
impossible
this
adventure
of
must
be
looked
upon
only
as
an
evil
dream
we
both
had
a
nightmare
in
those
hours
of
horror
but
it
is
time
for
us
to
awake
we
can
not
remain
paralyzed
with
fear
like
children
you
have
only
one
course
open
to
you
and
that
i
have
already
pointed
but
abbe
it
is
the
one
which
i
hold
the
most
impossible
of
all
i
have
sworn
by
everything
that
is
most
sacred
in
the
universe
and
the
human
an
oath
extorted
by
threats
and
violence
is
binding
on
none
even
human
laws
decree
this
divine
laws
especially
in
a
case
of
this
nature
absolve
the
human
conscience
beyond
a
doubt
if
you
were
orthodox
i
would
go
to
rome
yes
i
would
go
on
foot
to
get
you
absolved
from
so
rash
a
vow
but
you
are
not
a
submissive
child
of
the
pope
edmee
nor
am
you
wish
me
then
to
perjure
myself
your
soul
would
not
be
my
soul
would
i
took
an
oath
with
a
full
knowledge
of
what
i
was
doing
and
at
a
time
when
i
might
have
killed
myself
on
the
spot
for
in
my
hand
i
had
a
knife
three
times
as
large
as
this
but
i
wanted
to
live
above
all
i
wanted
to
see
my
father
again
and
kiss
him
to
put
an
end
to
the
agony
which
my
disappearance
must
have
caused
him
i
would
have
bartered
more
than
my
life
i
would
have
bartered
my
immortal
soul
since
then
too
as
i
told
you
last
night
i
have
renewed
my
vow
and
of
my
own
moreover
for
there
was
a
wall
between
my
amiable
and
how
could
you
have
been
so
imprudent
edmee
here
again
i
fail
to
understand
that
i
can
quite
believe
for
i
do
not
understand
myself
said
edmee
with
a
peculiar
expression
my
dear
child
you
must
open
your
hear
to
me
freely
i
am
the
only
person
here
who
can
advise
you
since
i
am
the
only
one
to
whom
you
can
tell
everything
under
the
seal
of
a
friendship
as
sacred
as
the
secrecy
of
catholic
confession
can
be
answer
me
then
you
do
not
really
look
upon
a
marriage
between
yourself
and
bernard
mauprat
as
possible
how
should
that
which
is
inevitable
be
impossible
said
edmee
there
is
nothing
more
possible
than
throwing
one
s
self
into
the
river
nothing
more
possible
than
surrendering
one
s
self
to
misery
and
despair
nothing
more
possible
consequently
than
marrying
bernard
in
any
case
i
will
not
be
the
one
to
celebrate
such
an
absurd
and
deplorable
union
cried
the
abbe
you
the
wife
and
the
slave
of
this
hamstringer
edmee
you
said
just
now
that
you
would
no
more
endure
the
violence
of
a
lover
than
a
husband
s
you
think
the
he
would
beat
me
if
he
did
not
kill
oh
no
she
replied
in
a
resolute
tone
with
a
wave
of
the
knife
i
would
kill
him
first
when
mauprat
meets
mauprat
you
can
laugh
edmee
o
my
god
you
can
laugh
at
the
thought
of
such
a
match
but
even
if
this
man
had
some
affection
and
esteem
for
you
think
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
you
to
have
anything
in
common
think
of
the
coarseness
of
his
ideas
the
vulgarity
of
his
speech
the
heart
rises
in
disgust
at
the
idea
of
such
a
union
good
god
in
what
language
would
you
speak
to
him
once
more
i
was
on
the
point
of
rising
and
falling
on
my
panegyrist
but
i
overcame
my
rage
edmee
began
to
speak
and
i
was
all
ears
again
i
know
very
well
that
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
days
i
should
have
nothing
better
to
do
than
cut
my
own
throat
but
since
sooner
or
later
it
must
come
to
that
why
should
i
not
go
forward
to
the
inevitable
hour
i
confess
that
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
life
not
all
those
who
have
been
to
have
returned
i
went
there
not
to
meet
death
but
to
betroth
myself
to
it
well
then
i
will
go
on
to
my
and
if
bernard
is
too
odious
i
will
kill
myself
after
the
edmee
your
head
seems
full
of
romantic
notions
at
present
said
the
abbe
losing
patience
thank
god
your
father
will
never
consent
to
the
marriage
he
has
given
his
word
to
de
la
march
and
you
too
have
given
yours
this
is
the
only
promise
that
is
my
father
would
consent
yes
with
joy
to
an
arrangement
which
perpetuated
his
name
and
line
directly
as
to
de
la
march
he
will
release
me
from
any
promise
without
my
taking
the
trouble
to
ask
him
as
soon
as
he
hears
that
i
passed
two
hours
at
there
will
be
no
need
of
any
other
he
would
be
very
unworthy
of
the
esteem
i
feel
for
him
if
he
considered
your
good
name
tarnished
by
an
unfortunate
adventure
from
which
you
came
out
thanks
to
bernard
said
edmee
for
after
all
i
ought
to
be
grateful
to
him
in
spite
of
his
reservations
and
conditions
he
performed
a
great
and
inconceivable
action
for
a
god
forbid
that
i
should
deny
the
good
qualities
which
education
may
have
developed
in
this
young
man
and
it
may
still
be
possible
by
approaching
him
on
this
better
side
of
his
to
make
him
listen
to
and
make
him
consent
to
be
taught
never
even
if
he
should
show
himself
willing
he
would
no
more
be
able
than
patience
when
the
body
is
made
for
an
animal
life
the
spirit
can
no
longer
submit
to
the
laws
of
the
i
think
so
too
but
that
is
not
the
point
i
suggest
that
you
should
have
an
explanation
with
him
and
make
him
understand
that
he
is
bound
in
honour
to
release
you
from
your
promise
and
resign
himself
to
your
marriage
with
de
la
marche
either
he
is
a
brute
unworthy
of
the
slightest
esteem
and
consideration
or
he
will
realize
his
crime
and
folly
and
yield
honestly
and
with
a
good
grace
free
me
from
the
vow
of
secrecy
to
which
i
am
bound
authorize
me
to
deal
plainly
with
him
and
i
will
guarantee
and
i
i
will
guarantee
the
contrary
said
edmee
besides
i
could
not
consent
to
this
whatever
bernard
may
be
i
am
anxious
to
come
out
of
our
duel
with
honour
and
if
i
acted
as
you
suggest
he
would
have
cause
to
believe
that
up
to
the
present
i
have
been
unworthily
trifling
with
well
there
is
only
one
means
left
and
that
is
to
trust
to
the
honour
and
discretion
of
de
la
marche
set
before
him
the
details
of
your
position
and
then
let
him
give
the
verdict
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
intrust
him
with
your
secret
and
you
are
quite
sure
of
his
honour
if
he
is
coward
enough
to
desert
you
in
such
a
position
your
remaining
resource
is
to
take
shelter
from
bernard
s
violence
behind
the
iron
bars
of
a
convent
you
can
remain
there
a
few
years
you
can
make
a
show
of
taking
the
veil
the
young
man
will
forget
you
and
they
will
set
you
free
indeed
that
is
the
only
reasonable
course
to
take
and
i
had
already
thought
of
it
but
it
is
not
yet
time
to
make
the
very
true
you
must
first
see
the
result
of
your
confession
to
de
la
marche
if
as
i
make
no
doubt
he
is
a
man
of
mettle
he
will
take
you
under
his
protection
and
then
procure
the
removal
of
this
bernard
whether
by
persuasion
or
what
authority
abbe
if
you
please
the
authority
which
our
customs
allow
one
gentleman
to
exercise
over
his
equal
honour
and
the
oh
abbe
you
too
then
are
a
man
with
a
thirst
for
blood
well
that
is
precisely
what
i
have
hitherto
tried
to
avoid
and
what
i
will
avoid
though
it
cost
me
my
life
and
honour
i
do
not
wish
that
there
should
be
any
fight
between
these
two
i
understand
one
of
the
two
is
very
rightly
dear
to
you
but
evidently
in
this
duel
it
is
not
de
la
marche
who
would
be
in
then
it
would
be
bernard
cried
edmee
well
i
should
hate
de
la
marche
if
he
insisted
on
a
duel
with
this
poor
boy
who
only
knows
how
to
handle
a
stick
or
a
sling
how
can
such
ideas
occur
to
you
abbe
you
must
really
loathe
this
unfortunate
bernard
and
fancy
me
getting
my
husband
to
cut
his
throat
as
a
return
for
having
saved
my
life
at
the
risk
of
his
own
no
no
i
will
not
suffer
any
one
either
to
challenge
him
or
humiliate
him
or
persecute
him
he
is
my
cousin
he
is
a
mauprat
he
is
almost
a
brother
i
will
not
let
him
be
driven
out
of
this
home
rather
i
will
go
these
are
very
generous
sentiments
edmee
answered
the
abbe
but
with
what
warmth
you
express
them
i
stand
confounded
and
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
offending
you
i
should
confess
that
this
solicitude
for
young
mauprat
suggests
to
me
a
strange
well
what
is
it
then
said
edmee
with
a
certain
brusqueness
if
you
insist
of
course
i
will
tell
you
you
seem
to
take
a
deeper
interest
in
this
young
man
than
in
de
la
marche
and
i
could
have
wished
to
think
which
has
the
greater
need
of
this
interest
you
bad
christian
said
edmee
with
a
smile
is
it
not
the
hardened
sinner
whose
eyes
have
never
looked
upon
the
light
but
come
edmee
you
love
de
la
marche
do
you
not
for
heaven
s
sake
do
not
if
by
love
she
replied
in
a
serious
tone
you
mean
a
feeling
of
trust
and
friendship
i
love
de
la
marche
but
if
you
mean
a
feeling
of
compassion
and
solicitude
i
love
bernard
it
remains
to
be
seen
which
of
these
two
affections
is
the
deeper
that
is
your
concern
abbe
for
my
part
it
troubles
me
but
little
for
i
feel
that
there
is
only
one
being
whom
i
love
with
passion
and
that
is
my
father
and
only
one
thing
that
i
love
with
enthusiasm
and
that
is
my
duty
probably
i
shall
regret
the
attentions
and
devotion
of
the
and
i
shall
share
in
the
grief
that
i
must
soon
cause
him
when
i
announce
that
i
can
never
be
his
wife
this
necessity
however
will
by
no
means
drive
me
to
desperation
because
i
know
that
de
la
marche
will
quickly
recover
i
am
not
joking
abbe
de
la
marche
is
a
man
of
no
depth
and
somewhat
if
your
love
for
him
is
no
greater
than
this
so
much
the
better
it
makes
one
trial
less
among
your
many
trials
still
this
indifference
robs
me
of
my
last
hope
of
seeing
you
rescued
from
bernard
do
not
let
this
grieve
you
either
bernard
will
yield
to
friendship
and
loyalty
and
improve
or
i
shall
escape
but
how
by
the
gate
of
the
convent
or
of
the
as
she
uttered
these
words
in
a
calm
tone
edmee
shook
back
her
long
black
hair
which
had
fallen
over
her
shoulders
and
partly
over
her
pale
face
come
she
said
god
will
help
us
it
is
folly
and
impiety
to
doubt
him
in
the
hour
of
danger
are
we
atheists
that
we
let
ourselves
be
discouraged
in
this
way
let
us
go
and
see
patience
he
will
bring
forth
some
wise
saw
to
ease
our
minds
he
is
the
old
oracle
who
solves
all
problems
without
understanding
they
moved
away
while
i
remained
in
a
state
of
consternation
oh
how
different
was
this
night
from
the
last
how
vast
a
step
i
had
just
taken
in
life
no
longer
on
the
path
of
flowers
but
on
the
arid
rocks
now
i
understood
all
the
odious
reality
of
the
part
i
had
been
playing
in
the
bottom
of
edmee
s
heart
i
had
just
read
the
fear
and
disgust
i
inspired
in
her
nothing
could
assuage
my
grief
for
nothing
now
could
arouse
my
anger
she
had
no
affection
for
de
la
marche
she
was
trifling
neither
with
him
nor
with
me
she
had
no
affection
for
either
of
us
how
could
i
have
believed
that
her
generous
sympathy
for
me
and
her
sublime
devotion
to
her
word
were
signs
of
love
how
in
the
hours
when
this
presumptuous
fancy
left
me
could
i
have
believed
that
in
order
to
resist
my
passion
she
must
needs
feel
love
for
another
it
had
come
to
pass
then
that
i
had
no
longer
any
object
on
which
to
vent
my
rage
now
it
could
result
only
in
edmee
s
flight
or
death
her
death
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
the
blood
ran
cold
in
my
veins
a
weight
fell
on
my
heart
and
i
felt
all
the
stings
of
remorse
piercing
it
this
night
of
agony
was
for
me
the
clearest
call
of
providence
at
last
i
understood
those
laws
of
modesty
and
sacred
liberty
which
my
ignorance
had
hitherto
outraged
and
blasphemed
they
astonished
me
more
than
ever
but
i
could
see
them
their
sanction
was
their
own
existence
edmee
s
strong
sincere
soul
appeared
before
me
like
the
stone
of
sinai
on
which
the
finger
of
god
has
traced
the
immutable
truth
her
virtue
was
not
feigned
her
knife
was
sharpened
ready
to
cut
out
the
stain
of
my
love
i
was
so
terrified
at
having
been
in
danger
of
seeing
her
die
in
my
arms
i
was
so
horrified
at
the
gross
insult
i
had
offered
her
while
seeking
to
overcome
her
resistance
that
i
began
to
devise
all
manner
of
impossible
plans
for
righting
the
wrongs
i
had
done
and
restoring
her
peace
of
mind
the
only
one
which
seemed
beyond
my
powers
was
to
tear
myself
away
from
her
for
while
these
feelings
of
esteem
and
respect
were
springing
up
in
me
my
love
was
changing
its
nature
so
to
speak
and
growing
vaster
and
taking
possession
of
all
my
being
edmee
appeared
to
me
in
a
new
light
she
was
no
longer
the
lovely
girl
whose
presence
stirred
a
tumult
in
my
senses
she
was
a
young
man
of
my
own
age
beautiful
as
a
seraph
proud
courageous
inflexible
in
honour
generous
capable
of
that
sublime
friendship
which
once
bound
together
brothers
in
arms
but
with
no
passionate
love
except
for
deity
like
the
paladins
of
old
who
braving
a
thousand
dangers
marched
to
the
holy
land
under
their
golden
armour
from
this
hour
i
felt
my
love
descending
from
the
wild
storms
of
the
brain
into
the
healthy
regions
of
the
heart
devotion
seemed
no
longer
an
enigma
to
me
i
resolved
that
on
the
very
next
morning
i
would
give
proof
of
my
submission
and
affection
it
was
quite
late
when
i
returned
to
the
chateau
tired
out
dying
of
hunger
and
exhausted
by
the
emotions
i
had
experienced
i
entered
the
pantry
found
a
piece
of
bread
and
began
eating
it
all
moist
with
my
tears
i
was
leaning
against
the
stove
in
the
dime
light
of
a
lamp
that
was
almost
out
when
i
suddenly
saw
edmee
enter
she
took
a
few
cherries
from
a
chest
and
slowly
approached
the
stove
pale
and
deep
in
thought
on
seeing
me
she
uttered
a
cry
and
let
the
cherries
fall
edmee
i
said
i
implore
you
never
to
be
afraid
of
me
again
that
is
all
i
can
say
now
for
i
do
not
know
how
to
explain
myself
and
yet
i
had
resolved
to
say
many
you
must
tell
me
them
some
other
time
cousin
she
answered
trying
to
smile
but
she
was
unable
to
disguise
the
fear
she
felt
at
finding
herself
alone
with
me
i
did
not
try
to
detain
her
i
felt
deeply
pained
and
humiliated
at
her
distrust
of
me
and
i
knew
i
had
no
right
to
complain
yet
never
had
any
man
stood
in
greater
need
of
a
word
of
encouragement
just
as
she
was
going
out
of
the
room
i
broke
down
altogether
and
burst
into
tears
as
on
the
previous
night
at
the
chapel
window
edmee
stopped
on
the
threshold
and
hesitated
a
moment
then
yielding
to
the
kindly
impulses
of
her
heart
she
overcame
her
fears
and
returned
towards
me
pausing
a
few
yards
from
my
chair
she
said
bernard
you
are
unhappy
tell
me
is
it
my
fault
i
was
unable
to
reply
i
was
ashamed
of
my
tears
but
the
more
i
tried
to
restrain
them
the
more
my
breast
heaved
with
sobs
with
men
as
physically
strong
as
i
was
tears
are
generally
convulsions
mine
were
like
the
pangs
of
death
come
now
just
tell
me
what
is
wrong
cried
edmee
with
some
of
the
bluntness
of
sisterly
affection
and
she
ventured
to
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
she
was
looking
at
me
with
an
expression
of
wistfulness
and
a
big
tear
was
trickling
down
her
cheek
i
threw
myself
on
my
knees
and
tried
to
speak
but
that
was
still
impossible
i
could
do
no
more
than
mutter
the
word
several
times
what
of
tomorrow
said
edmee
do
you
not
like
being
here
do
you
want
to
go
away
i
will
go
if
it
will
please
you
i
replied
tell
me
do
you
wish
never
to
see
me
again
i
do
not
wish
that
at
all
she
rejoined
you
will
stop
here
won
t
it
is
for
you
to
decide
i
answered
she
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
i
was
still
on
my
knees
she
leant
over
the
back
of
my
chair
yes
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
are
good
at
heart
she
said
as
if
she
were
answering
some
inner
objection
a
mauprat
can
be
nothing
by
halves
and
as
soon
as
you
have
once
known
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
it
is
certain
you
ought
to
have
a
noble
life
before
i
will
make
it
so
i
answered
you
mean
it
she
said
with
unaffected
joy
on
my
honour
edmee
and
on
yours
dare
you
give
me
your
hand
certainly
she
said
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
but
she
was
still
trembling
you
have
been
forming
good
resolutions
then
she
said
i
have
been
forming
such
resolutions
i
replied
that
you
will
never
have
to
reproach
me
again
and
now
edmee
when
you
return
to
your
room
please
do
not
bolt
your
door
any
more
you
need
no
longer
be
afraid
of
me
henceforth
i
shall
only
wish
what
you
she
again
fixed
on
me
a
look
of
amazement
then
after
pressing
my
hand
she
moved
away
but
turned
round
several
times
to
look
at
me
again
as
if
unable
to
believe
in
such
a
sudden
conversion
at
last
stopping
in
the
doorway
she
said
to
me
in
an
affectionate
tone
you
too
must
go
and
get
some
rest
you
look
tired
and
for
the
last
two
days
you
have
seemed
sad
and
very
much
altered
if
you
do
not
wish
to
make
me
anxious
you
will
take
care
of
yourself
she
gave
me
a
sweet
little
nod
in
her
big
eyes
already
hollowed
by
suffering
there
was
an
indefinable
expression
in
which
distrust
and
hope
affection
and
wonder
were
depicted
alternately
or
at
times
all
together
i
will
take
care
of
myself
i
will
get
some
sleep
and
i
will
not
be
sad
any
longer
i
answered
and
you
will
work
and
i
will
work
but
you
edmee
will
you
forgive
me
for
all
the
pain
i
have
caused
you
and
will
you
try
to
like
me
a
little
i
shall
like
you
very
much
she
replied
if
you
are
always
as
you
are
this
on
the
morrow
at
daybreak
i
went
to
the
abbe
s
room
he
was
already
up
and
reading
monsieur
aubert
i
said
to
him
you
have
several
times
offered
to
give
me
lessons
i
now
come
to
request
you
to
carry
out
your
kind
i
had
spent
part
of
the
night
in
preparing
this
opening
speech
and
in
deciding
how
i
had
best
comport
myself
in
the
abbe
s
presence
without
really
hating
him
for
i
could
quite
see
that
he
meant
well
and
that
he
bore
me
only
because
of
my
faults
i
felt
very
bitter
towards
him
inwardly
i
recognised
that
i
deserved
all
the
bad
things
he
had
said
about
me
to
edmee
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
might
have
insisted
somewhat
more
on
the
good
side
of
mine
to
which
he
had
given
a
merely
passing
word
and
which
could
not
have
escaped
the
notice
of
a
man
so
observant
as
himself
i
had
determined
therefore
to
be
very
cold
and
very
proud
in
my
bearing
towards
him
to
this
end
i
judged
with
a
certain
show
of
logic
that
i
ought
to
display
great
docility
as
long
as
the
lesson
lasted
and
that
immediately
afterwards
i
ought
to
leave
him
with
a
very
curt
expression
of
thanks
in
a
word
i
wished
to
humiliate
him
in
his
post
of
tutor
for
i
was
not
unaware
that
he
depended
for
his
livelihood
on
my
uncle
and
that
unless
he
renounced
this
livelihood
or
showed
himself
ungrateful
he
could
not
well
refuse
to
undertake
my
education
my
reasoning
here
was
very
good
but
the
spirit
which
prompted
it
was
very
bad
and
subsequently
i
felt
so
much
regret
for
my
behaviour
that
i
made
him
a
sort
of
friendly
confession
with
a
request
for
absolution
however
not
to
anticipate
events
i
will
simply
say
that
the
first
few
days
after
my
conversation
afforded
me
an
ample
revenge
for
the
prejudices
too
well
founded
in
many
respects
which
this
man
had
against
me
he
would
have
deserved
the
title
of
the
just
assigned
him
by
patience
had
not
a
habit
of
distrust
interfered
with
his
first
impulses
the
persecutions
of
which
he
had
so
long
been
the
object
had
developed
in
him
this
instinctive
feeling
of
fear
which
remained
with
him
all
his
life
and
made
trust
in
others
always
very
difficult
to
him
though
all
the
more
flattering
and
touching
perhaps
when
he
accorded
it
since
then
i
have
observed
this
characteristic
in
many
worthy
priests
they
generally
have
the
spirit
of
charity
but
not
the
feeling
of
friendship
i
wished
to
make
him
suffer
and
i
succeeded
spite
inspired
me
i
behaved
as
a
nobleman
might
to
an
inferior
i
preserved
an
excellent
bearing
displayed
great
attention
much
politeness
and
an
icy
stiffness
i
determined
to
give
him
no
chance
to
make
me
blush
at
my
ignorance
and
to
this
end
i
acted
so
as
to
anticipate
all
his
observations
by
accusing
myself
at
once
of
knowing
nothing
and
by
requesting
him
to
teach
me
the
very
rudiments
of
things
when
i
had
finished
my
first
lesson
i
saw
in
his
penetrating
eyes
into
which
i
had
managed
to
penetrate
myself
a
desire
to
pass
from
this
coldness
to
some
sort
of
intimacy
but
i
carefully
avoided
making
any
response
he
thought
to
disarm
me
by
praising
my
attention
and
intelligence
you
are
troubling
yourself
unnecessarily
monsieur
i
replied
i
stand
in
no
need
of
encouragement
i
have
not
the
least
faith
in
my
intelligence
but
of
my
attention
i
certainly
am
very
sure
but
since
it
is
solely
for
my
own
good
that
i
am
doing
my
best
to
apply
myself
to
this
work
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
compliment
me
on
with
these
words
i
bowed
to
him
and
withdrew
to
my
room
where
i
immediately
did
the
french
exercise
that
he
had
set
me
when
i
went
down
to
luncheon
i
saw
that
edmee
was
already
aware
of
the
execution
of
the
promise
i
had
made
the
previous
evening
she
at
once
greeted
me
with
outstretched
hand
and
frequently
during
luncheon
called
me
her
dear
cousin
till
at
last
de
la
marche
s
face
which
was
usually
expressionless
expressed
surprise
or
something
very
near
it
i
was
hoping
that
he
would
take
the
opportunity
to
demand
an
explanation
of
my
insulting
words
of
the
previous
day
and
although
i
had
resolved
to
discuss
the
matter
in
a
spirit
of
great
moderation
i
felt
very
much
hurt
at
the
care
which
he
took
to
avoid
it
this
indifference
to
an
insult
that
i
had
offered
implied
a
sort
of
contempt
which
annoyed
me
very
much
but
the
fear
of
displeasing
edmee
gave
me
strength
to
restrain
myself
incredible
as
it
may
seem
my
resolve
to
supplant
him
was
not
for
one
moment
shaken
by
this
humiliating
apprenticeship
which
i
had
now
to
serve
before
i
could
manage
to
obtain
the
most
elementary
notions
of
things
in
general
any
other
than
i
filled
like
myself
with
remorse
for
wrongs
committed
would
have
found
no
surer
method
of
repairing
them
than
by
going
away
and
restoring
to
edmee
her
perfect
independence
and
absolute
peace
of
mind
this
was
the
only
method
which
did
not
occur
to
me
or
if
it
did
it
was
rejected
with
scorn
as
a
sign
of
apostasy
stubbornness
allied
to
temerity
ran
through
my
veins
with
the
blood
of
the
mauprats
no
sooner
had
i
imagined
a
means
of
winning
her
whom
i
loved
than
i
embraced
it
with
audacity
and
i
think
it
would
not
have
been
otherwise
even
had
her
confidences
to
the
abbe
in
the
park
shown
me
that
her
love
was
given
to
my
rival
such
assurance
on
the
part
of
a
young
man
who
at
the
age
of
seventeen
was
taking
his
first
lesson
in
french
grammar
and
who
moreover
had
a
very
exaggerated
notion
of
the
length
and
difficulty
of
the
studies
necessary
to
put
him
on
a
level
with
de
la
march
showed
you
must
allow
a
certain
moral
force
i
do
not
know
if
i
was
happily
endowed
in
the
matter
of
intelligence
the
abbe
assured
me
that
i
was
but
for
my
own
part
i
think
that
my
rapid
progress
was
due
to
nothing
but
my
courage
this
was
such
as
to
make
me
presume
too
much
on
my
physical
powers
the
abbe
had
told
me
that
with
a
strong
will
any
one
of
my
age
could
master
all
the
rules
of
the
language
within
a
month
at
the
end
of
the
month
i
expressed
myself
with
facility
and
wrote
correctly
edmee
had
a
sort
of
occult
influence
over
my
studies
at
her
wish
i
was
not
taught
latin
for
she
declared
that
i
was
too
old
to
devote
several
years
to
a
fancy
branch
of
learning
and
that
the
essential
thing
was
to
shape
my
heart
and
understanding
with
ideas
rather
than
to
adorn
my
mind
with
words
of
an
evening
under
pretext
of
wishing
to
read
some
favourite
book
again
she
read
aloud
alternately
with
the
abbe
passages
from
condillac
fenelon
bernardin
de
jean
jacques
and
even
from
montaigne
and
montesquieu
these
passages
it
is
true
were
chosen
beforehand
and
adapted
to
my
powers
i
understood
them
fairly
well
and
i
secretly
wondered
at
this
for
if
during
the
day
i
opened
these
same
books
at
random
i
found
myself
brought
to
a
standstill
at
every
line
with
the
superstition
natural
to
young
lovers
i
willingly
imagined
that
in
passing
through
edmee
s
mouth
the
authors
acquired
a
magic
clearness
and
that
by
some
miracle
my
mind
expanded
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
however
edmee
was
careful
to
disguise
the
interest
she
took
in
teaching
me
herself
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
was
mistaken
in
thinking
that
she
ought
not
to
betray
her
solicitude
it
would
only
have
roused
me
to
still
greater
efforts
in
my
work
but
in
this
imbued
as
she
was
with
the
teachings
of
she
was
merely
putting
into
practice
the
theories
of
her
favourite
philosopher
as
it
was
i
spared
myself
but
little
for
my
courage
would
not
admit
of
any
forethought
consequently
i
was
soon
obliged
to
stop
the
change
of
air
of
diet
and
of
habits
my
lucubrations
the
want
of
vigorous
exercise
my
intense
application
in
a
word
the
terrible
revolution
which
my
nature
had
to
stir
up
against
itself
in
order
to
pass
from
the
state
of
a
man
of
the
woods
to
that
of
an
intelligent
being
brought
on
a
kind
of
brain
fever
which
made
me
almost
mad
for
some
weeks
then
an
idiot
for
some
days
and
finally
disappeared
leaving
me
a
mere
wreck
physically
with
a
mind
completely
severed
from
the
past
but
sternly
braced
to
meet
the
future
one
night
when
i
was
at
the
most
critical
stage
of
my
illness
during
a
lucid
interval
i
caught
sight
of
edmee
in
my
room
at
first
i
thought
i
was
dreaming
the
was
casting
an
unsteady
glimmer
over
the
room
near
me
was
a
pale
form
lying
motionless
on
an
easy
chair
i
could
distinguish
some
long
black
tresses
falling
loosely
over
a
white
dress
i
sat
up
weak
though
i
was
and
scarcely
able
to
move
and
tried
to
get
out
of
bed
patience
however
suddenly
appeared
by
the
bedside
and
gently
stopped
me
was
sleeping
in
another
every
night
there
used
to
be
two
men
watching
me
thus
ready
to
hold
me
down
by
force
whenever
i
became
violent
during
my
delirium
frequently
the
abbe
was
one
sometimes
the
worthy
marcasse
who
before
leaving
berry
to
go
on
his
annual
round
through
the
neighbouring
province
had
returned
to
have
a
farewell
hunt
in
the
outhouses
of
the
chateau
and
who
kindly
offered
to
relieve
the
servants
in
their
painful
task
of
keeping
watch
over
me
as
i
was
wholly
unconscious
of
my
illness
it
was
but
natural
that
the
unexpected
presence
of
the
hermit
in
my
room
should
cause
me
considerable
astonishment
and
throw
me
into
a
state
of
great
agitation
my
attacks
had
been
so
violent
that
evening
that
i
had
no
strength
left
i
abandoned
myself
therefore
to
my
melancholy
ravings
and
taking
the
good
man
s
hand
i
asked
him
if
it
was
really
edmee
s
corpse
that
he
had
placed
in
the
by
my
bedside
it
is
edmee
s
living
self
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
but
she
is
still
asleep
my
dear
monsieur
and
we
must
not
wake
her
if
there
is
anything
you
would
like
i
am
here
to
attend
to
you
and
right
gladly
i
do
my
good
patience
you
are
deceiving
me
i
said
she
is
dead
and
so
am
i
and
you
have
come
to
bury
us
but
you
must
put
us
in
the
same
coffin
do
you
hear
for
we
are
betrothed
where
is
her
ring
take
it
off
and
put
it
on
my
finger
our
has
he
tried
in
vain
to
dispel
this
hallucination
i
held
to
my
belief
that
edmee
was
dead
and
declared
that
i
should
never
be
quiet
in
my
shroud
until
i
had
been
given
my
wife
s
ring
edmee
who
had
sat
up
with
me
for
several
nights
was
so
exhausted
that
our
voices
did
not
awaken
her
besides
i
was
speaking
in
a
whisper
like
patience
with
that
instinctive
tendency
to
imitate
which
is
met
with
only
in
children
or
idiots
i
persisted
in
my
fancy
and
patience
who
was
afraid
that
it
might
turn
into
madness
went
and
very
carefully
removed
a
cornelian
ring
from
one
of
edmee
s
fingers
and
put
it
on
mine
as
soon
as
i
felt
it
there
i
carried
it
to
my
lips
and
then
with
my
arms
crossed
on
my
breast
in
the
manner
of
a
corpse
in
a
coffin
i
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
on
the
morrow
when
they
tried
to
take
the
ring
from
me
i
resisted
violently
and
they
abandoned
the
attempt
i
fell
asleep
again
and
the
abbe
removed
it
during
my
sleep
but
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
noticed
the
theft
and
once
more
began
to
rave
edmee
who
was
in
the
room
ran
to
me
at
once
and
pressed
the
ring
over
my
finger
at
the
same
time
rebuking
the
abbe
i
immediately
grew
calm
and
gazing
on
her
with
eyes
said
is
it
not
true
that
you
are
my
wife
in
death
as
in
life
certainly
she
replied
set
your
mind
at
eternity
is
long
i
said
and
i
should
like
to
spend
it
in
recalling
your
caresses
but
i
send
my
thoughts
back
in
vain
they
bring
me
no
remembrance
of
your
she
leant
over
and
gave
me
a
kiss
edmee
that
is
very
wrong
said
the
abbe
such
remedies
turn
to
let
me
do
as
i
like
abbe
she
replied
with
evident
impatience
sitting
down
near
my
bed
i
must
ask
you
to
let
me
do
as
i
i
fell
asleep
with
one
of
my
hands
in
hers
repeating
at
intervals
how
sweet
it
is
in
the
grave
are
we
not
fortunate
to
be
dead
during
my
convalescence
edmee
was
much
more
reserved
but
no
less
attentive
i
told
her
my
dreams
and
learnt
from
her
how
far
my
recollections
were
of
real
events
without
her
testimony
i
should
always
have
believed
that
i
had
dreamt
everything
i
implored
her
to
let
me
keep
the
ring
and
she
consented
i
ought
to
have
added
to
show
my
gratitude
for
all
her
goodness
that
i
should
keep
it
as
a
pledge
of
friendship
and
not
as
a
sign
of
our
engagement
but
such
a
renunciation
was
beyond
me
one
day
i
asked
for
news
of
de
la
marche
it
was
only
to
patience
that
i
dared
to
put
this
question
gone
he
answered
what
gone
i
replied
for
long
forever
please
god
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
for
i
ask
no
questions
but
i
happened
to
be
in
the
garden
when
he
took
leave
of
her
and
it
was
all
as
cold
as
a
december
night
still
was
said
on
both
sides
but
though
edmee
s
manner
was
kind
and
honest
as
it
always
is
the
other
had
the
face
of
a
farmer
when
he
sees
frosts
in
april
mauprat
mauprat
they
tell
me
that
you
have
become
a
great
student
and
a
genuine
good
fellow
remember
what
i
told
you
when
you
are
old
there
will
probably
no
longer
be
any
titles
or
estate
perhaps
you
will
be
called
father
mauprat
as
i
am
called
father
patience
though
i
have
never
been
either
a
priest
or
a
father
of
a
well
what
are
you
driving
at
remember
what
i
once
told
you
he
repeated
there
are
many
ways
of
being
a
sorcerer
and
one
may
read
the
future
without
being
a
servant
of
the
devil
for
my
part
i
give
my
consent
to
your
marriage
with
your
cousin
continue
to
behave
decently
you
are
a
wise
man
now
and
can
read
fluently
from
any
book
set
before
you
what
more
do
you
want
there
are
so
many
books
here
that
the
sweat
runs
from
my
brow
at
the
very
sight
of
them
it
seems
as
if
i
were
again
starting
the
old
torment
of
not
being
able
to
learn
to
read
but
you
have
soon
cured
yourself
if
hubert
were
willing
to
take
my
advice
he
would
fix
the
wedding
for
the
next
that
is
enough
patience
i
said
this
is
a
painful
subject
with
me
my
cousin
does
not
love
i
tell
you
she
does
you
lie
in
your
throat
as
the
nobles
say
i
know
well
enough
how
she
nursed
you
and
marcasse
from
the
housetop
happened
to
look
through
her
window
and
saw
her
on
her
knees
in
the
middle
of
the
room
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
day
that
you
were
so
these
imprudent
assertions
of
patience
edmee
s
tender
cares
the
departure
of
de
la
marche
and
more
than
anything
else
the
weakness
of
my
brain
enabled
me
to
believe
what
i
wished
but
in
proportion
as
i
regained
my
strength
edmee
withdrew
further
and
further
within
the
bounds
of
calm
and
discreet
friendship
never
did
man
recover
his
health
with
less
pleasure
than
i
mine
for
each
day
made
edmee
s
visits
shorter
and
when
i
was
able
to
leave
my
room
i
had
merely
a
few
hours
a
day
near
her
as
before
my
illness
with
marvellous
skill
she
had
given
me
proof
of
the
tenderest
affection
without
ever
allowing
herself
to
be
drawn
into
a
fresh
explanation
concerning
our
mysterious
betrothal
if
i
had
not
yet
sufficient
greatness
of
soul
to
renounce
my
rights
i
had
at
least
developed
enough
honour
not
to
refer
to
them
and
i
found
myself
on
exactly
the
same
terms
with
her
as
at
the
time
when
i
had
fallen
de
la
marche
was
in
paris
but
according
to
her
he
had
been
summoned
thither
by
his
military
duties
and
ought
to
return
at
the
end
of
the
winter
on
which
we
were
entering
nothing
that
the
chevalier
or
the
abbe
said
tended
to
show
that
there
had
been
a
quarrel
between
edmee
and
him
they
rarely
spoke
of
the
but
when
they
had
to
speak
of
him
they
did
so
naturally
and
without
any
signs
of
repugnance
i
was
again
filled
with
my
old
doubts
and
could
find
no
remedy
for
them
except
in
the
kingdom
of
my
own
will
i
will
force
her
to
prefer
me
i
would
say
to
myself
as
i
raised
my
eyes
from
my
book
and
watched
edmee
s
great
inscrutable
eyes
calmly
fixed
on
the
letters
which
her
father
occasionally
received
from
de
la
marche
and
which
he
would
hand
to
her
as
soon
as
he
had
read
them
i
buried
myself
in
my
work
again
for
a
long
time
i
suffered
from
frightful
pains
in
the
head
but
i
overcame
them
stoically
edmee
again
began
the
course
of
studies
which
she
had
indirectly
laid
down
for
my
winter
evenings
once
more
i
astonished
the
abbe
by
my
aptitude
and
the
rapidity
of
my
conquests
the
kindness
he
had
shown
me
during
my
illness
had
disarmed
me
and
although
i
was
still
unable
to
feel
any
genuine
affection
for
him
knowing
well
that
he
was
of
little
service
to
me
with
my
cousin
i
gave
him
proof
of
much
more
confidence
and
respect
than
in
the
past
his
talks
were
as
useful
to
me
as
my
reading
i
was
allowed
to
accompany
him
in
his
walks
in
the
park
and
in
his
philosophical
visits
to
patience
s
hut
this
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
seeing
edmee
more
frequently
and
for
longer
periods
my
behaviour
was
such
that
all
her
mistrust
vanished
and
she
no
longer
feared
to
be
alone
with
me
on
such
occasions
however
i
had
but
little
scope
for
displaying
my
heroism
for
the
abbe
whose
vigilance
nothing
could
lull
to
sleep
was
always
at
our
heels
this
supervision
no
longer
annoyed
me
on
the
contrary
i
was
pleased
at
it
for
in
spite
of
all
my
resolutions
the
storms
of
passion
would
still
sweep
my
senses
into
a
mysterious
disorder
and
once
or
twice
when
i
found
myself
alone
with
edmee
i
left
her
abruptly
and
went
away
so
that
she
might
not
perceive
my
agitation
our
life
then
was
apparently
calm
and
peaceful
and
for
some
time
it
was
so
in
reality
but
soon
i
disturbed
it
more
than
ever
by
a
vice
which
education
developed
in
me
and
which
had
hitherto
been
hidden
under
coarser
but
less
fatal
vices
this
vice
the
bane
of
my
new
period
of
life
was
vanity
in
spite
of
their
theories
the
abbe
and
my
cousin
made
the
mistake
of
showing
too
much
pleasure
at
my
rapid
progress
they
had
so
little
expected
perseverance
from
me
that
they
gave
all
the
credit
to
my
exceptional
abilities
perhaps
too
in
the
marked
success
of
the
philosophical
ideas
they
had
applied
to
my
education
they
saw
something
of
a
triumph
for
themselves
certain
it
is
i
was
not
loath
to
let
myself
be
persuaded
that
i
had
great
intellectual
powers
and
that
i
was
a
man
very
much
above
the
average
my
dear
instructors
were
soon
to
gather
the
sad
fruit
of
their
imprudence
and
it
was
already
too
late
to
check
the
flight
of
my
immoderate
conceit
perhaps
too
this
abominable
trait
in
my
character
kept
under
by
the
bad
treatment
i
had
endured
in
childhood
was
now
merely
revealing
its
existence
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
we
carry
within
us
from
our
earliest
years
the
seeds
of
those
virtues
and
vices
which
are
in
time
made
to
bear
fruit
by
the
action
of
our
environment
as
for
myself
i
had
not
yet
found
anything
whereon
my
vanity
could
feed
for
on
what
could
i
have
prided
myself
at
the
beginning
of
my
acquaintance
with
edmee
but
no
sooner
was
food
forthcoming
than
suffering
vanity
rose
up
in
triumph
and
filled
me
with
as
much
presumption
as
previously
it
had
inspired
me
with
bashfulness
and
boorish
reserve
i
was
moreover
as
delighted
at
being
able
at
last
to
express
my
thoughts
with
ease
as
a
young
falcon
fresh
from
the
nest
trying
its
wings
for
the
first
time
consequently
i
became
as
talkative
as
i
had
been
silent
the
others
were
too
indulgent
to
my
prattle
i
had
not
sense
enough
to
see
that
they
were
merely
listening
to
me
as
they
would
to
a
spoilt
child
i
thought
myself
a
man
and
what
is
more
a
remarkable
man
i
grew
arrogant
and
superlatively
ridiculous
my
uncle
the
chevalier
who
had
not
taken
any
part
in
my
education
and
who
only
smiled
with
fatherly
at
the
first
steps
i
took
in
my
new
career
was
the
first
to
notice
the
false
direction
in
which
i
was
advancing
he
found
it
unbecoming
that
i
should
raise
my
voice
as
loudly
as
his
own
and
mentioned
the
matter
to
edmee
with
great
sweetness
she
warned
me
of
this
and
lest
i
should
feel
annoyed
at
her
speaking
of
it
told
me
that
i
was
quite
right
in
my
argument
but
that
her
father
was
now
too
old
to
be
converted
to
new
ideas
and
that
i
ought
to
sacrifice
my
enthusiastic
affirmations
to
his
patriarchal
dignity
i
promised
not
to
repeat
the
offence
and
i
did
not
keep
my
word
the
fact
is
the
chevalier
was
imbued
with
many
prejudices
considering
the
days
in
which
he
lived
he
had
received
a
very
good
education
for
a
country
nobleman
but
the
century
had
moved
more
rapidly
than
he
edmee
ardent
and
romantic
the
abbe
full
of
sentiment
and
systems
had
moved
even
more
rapidly
than
the
century
and
if
the
vast
gulf
which
lay
between
them
and
the
patriarch
was
scarcely
perceptible
this
was
owing
to
the
respect
which
they
rightly
felt
for
him
and
to
the
love
he
had
for
his
daughter
i
rushed
forward
at
full
speed
as
you
may
imagine
into
edmee
s
ideas
but
i
had
not
like
herself
sufficient
delicacy
of
feeling
to
maintain
a
becoming
reticence
the
violence
of
my
character
found
an
outlet
in
politics
and
philosophy
and
i
tasted
unspeakable
pleasure
in
those
heated
disputes
which
at
that
time
in
france
not
only
at
all
public
meetings
but
also
in
the
bosoms
of
families
were
preluding
the
tempests
of
the
revolution
i
doubt
if
there
was
a
single
house
from
palace
to
hovel
which
had
not
its
orator
rugged
fiery
absolute
and
ready
to
descend
into
the
parliamentary
arena
i
was
the
orator
of
the
chateau
of
and
my
worthy
uncle
accustomed
to
a
resemblance
of
authority
over
those
about
him
which
prevented
him
from
seeing
the
real
revolt
of
their
minds
could
ill
endure
such
candid
opposition
as
mine
he
was
proud
and
and
moreover
had
a
difficulty
in
expressing
himself
which
increased
his
natural
impatience
and
made
him
feel
annoyed
with
himself
he
would
give
a
furious
kick
to
the
burning
logs
on
the
hearth
he
would
smash
his
into
a
thousand
pieces
scatter
clouds
of
snuff
about
the
floor
and
shout
so
violently
as
to
make
the
lofty
ceilings
of
his
mansion
ring
with
his
resonant
voice
all
this
i
regret
to
say
amused
me
immensely
and
with
some
sentence
but
newly
spelt
out
from
my
books
i
loved
to
destroy
the
frail
scaffolding
of
ideas
which
had
served
him
all
his
life
this
was
great
folly
and
very
foolish
pride
on
my
part
but
my
love
of
opposition
and
my
desire
to
display
intellectually
the
energy
which
was
wanting
in
my
physical
life
were
continually
carrying
me
away
in
vain
would
edmee
cough
as
a
hint
that
i
should
say
no
more
and
make
an
effort
to
save
her
father
s
by
bringing
forward
some
argument
in
his
favour
though
against
her
own
judgement
the
lukewarmness
of
her
help
and
my
apparent
submission
to
her
only
irritated
my
adversary
more
and
more
let
him
have
his
say
he
would
cry
edmee
you
must
not
interfere
i
want
to
beat
him
on
all
points
if
you
continually
interrupt
us
i
shall
never
be
able
to
make
him
see
his
and
then
the
squall
would
blow
stronger
from
both
sides
until
at
last
the
chevalier
seriously
offended
would
walk
out
of
the
room
and
go
and
vent
his
on
his
huntsman
or
his
hounds
what
most
contributed
to
the
recurrence
of
these
unseemly
wrangles
and
to
the
growth
of
my
ridiculous
obstinacy
was
my
uncle
s
extreme
goodness
and
the
rapidity
of
his
recovery
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
had
entirely
forgotten
my
rudeness
and
his
own
irritation
he
would
speak
to
me
as
usual
and
inquire
into
all
my
wishes
and
all
my
wants
with
that
fatherly
solicitude
which
always
kept
him
in
a
benevolent
mood
this
incomparable
man
could
never
had
slept
had
he
not
before
going
to
bed
embraced
all
his
family
and
atoned
either
by
a
word
or
a
kindly
glance
for
any
ebullitions
of
temper
which
the
meanest
of
his
servants
might
have
had
to
bear
during
the
day
such
goodness
ought
to
have
disarmed
me
and
closed
my
mouth
forever
each
evening
i
vowed
that
it
should
but
each
morning
i
returned
as
the
scriptures
say
to
my
vomit
again
edmee
suffered
more
and
more
every
day
from
this
development
of
my
character
she
cast
about
for
means
to
cure
it
if
there
was
never
and
more
reserved
than
she
never
was
there
mother
more
tender
after
many
discussions
with
the
abbe
she
resolved
to
persuade
her
father
to
change
the
routine
of
our
life
somewhat
and
to
remove
our
establishment
to
paris
for
the
last
weeks
of
the
carnival
our
long
stay
in
the
country
the
isolation
which
the
position
of
and
the
bad
state
of
the
roads
had
left
us
since
the
beginning
of
winter
the
monotony
of
our
daily
life
all
tended
to
foster
our
wearisome
quibbling
my
character
was
being
more
and
more
spoilt
by
it
and
though
it
afforded
my
uncle
even
greater
pleasure
than
myself
his
health
suffered
as
a
result
and
the
childish
passions
daily
aroused
were
no
doubt
hastening
his
decay
the
abbe
was
suffering
from
edmee
was
depressed
whether
in
consequence
of
our
mode
of
life
or
owing
to
causes
unknown
to
the
rest
it
was
her
wish
to
go
and
we
went
for
her
father
was
uneasy
about
her
melancholy
and
sought
only
to
do
as
she
desired
i
jumped
for
joy
at
the
thought
of
seeing
paris
and
while
edmee
was
flattering
herself
that
intercourse
with
the
world
would
refine
the
grossness
of
my
pedantry
i
was
dreaming
of
a
triumphal
progress
through
the
world
which
had
been
held
up
to
such
scorn
by
our
philosophers
we
started
on
our
journey
one
fine
morning
in
march
the
chevalier
with
his
daughter
and
mademoiselle
leblanc
in
one
myself
in
another
with
the
abbe
who
could
ill
conceal
his
delight
at
the
thought
of
seeing
the
capital
for
the
first
time
in
him
life
and
my
valet
who
lest
he
should
forget
his
customary
politeness
made
profound
bows
to
every
individual
we
passed
xii
old
bernard
tired
from
talking
so
long
had
promised
to
resume
his
story
on
the
morrow
at
the
appointed
hour
we
called
upon
him
to
keep
his
word
and
he
continued
thus
this
visit
marked
a
new
phase
in
my
life
at
i
had
been
absorbed
in
my
love
and
my
work
i
had
concentrated
all
my
energies
upon
these
two
points
no
sooner
had
i
arrived
at
paris
than
a
thick
curtain
seemed
to
fall
before
my
eyes
and
for
several
days
as
i
could
not
understand
anything
i
felt
astonished
at
nothing
i
formed
a
very
exaggerated
estimate
of
the
passing
actors
who
appeared
upon
the
scene
but
i
formed
no
less
exaggerated
an
estimate
of
the
ease
with
which
i
should
soon
rival
these
imaginary
powers
my
enterprising
and
presumptuous
nature
saw
challenges
everywhere
and
obstacles
nowhere
though
i
was
in
the
same
house
as
my
uncle
and
cousin
my
room
was
on
a
separate
floor
and
henceforth
i
spent
the
greater
part
of
my
time
with
the
abbe
i
was
far
from
being
dazed
by
the
material
advantages
of
my
position
but
in
proportion
as
i
realized
how
precarious
or
painful
were
the
positions
of
many
others
the
more
conscious
i
became
of
the
comfort
of
my
own
i
appreciated
the
excellent
character
of
my
tutor
and
the
respect
my
lackey
showed
me
no
longer
seemed
objectionable
with
the
freedom
that
i
enjoyed
and
the
unlimited
money
at
my
command
and
the
restless
energy
of
youth
it
is
astonishing
that
i
did
not
fall
into
some
excess
were
it
only
gambling
which
might
well
have
appealed
to
my
combative
instincts
it
was
my
own
ignorance
of
everything
that
prevented
this
it
made
me
extremely
suspicious
and
the
abbe
who
was
very
observant
and
held
himself
responsible
for
my
actions
managed
most
cleverly
to
work
upon
my
haughty
reserve
he
increased
it
in
regard
to
such
things
as
might
have
done
me
harm
and
dispelled
it
in
contrary
cases
moreover
he
was
careful
to
provide
me
with
sufficient
reasonable
distractions
which
while
they
could
not
take
the
place
of
the
joys
of
love
served
at
least
to
lessen
the
smart
of
its
wounds
as
to
temptations
to
debauchery
i
felt
none
i
had
too
much
pride
to
yearn
for
any
woman
in
which
i
had
not
seen
as
in
edmee
the
first
of
her
sex
we
used
all
to
meet
at
dinner
and
as
a
rule
we
paid
visits
in
the
evening
by
observing
the
world
from
a
corner
of
a
i
learnt
more
of
it
in
a
few
days
than
i
should
have
done
in
a
whole
year
from
guesses
and
inquiries
i
doubt
whether
i
should
ever
have
understood
society
if
i
had
always
been
obliged
to
view
it
from
a
certain
distance
my
brain
refused
to
form
a
clear
image
of
the
ideas
which
occupied
the
brains
of
others
but
as
soon
as
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
this
chaos
the
confused
mass
was
compelled
to
fall
into
some
sort
of
order
and
reveal
a
large
part
of
its
elements
this
path
which
led
me
into
life
was
not
without
charms
for
me
i
remember
at
its
beginning
amid
all
the
conflicting
interests
of
the
surrounding
world
i
had
nothing
to
ask
for
aim
at
or
argue
about
fortune
had
taken
me
by
the
hand
one
fine
morning
she
had
lifted
me
out
of
an
abyss
and
put
me
down
on
a
bed
of
roses
and
made
me
a
young
gentleman
the
eagerness
of
others
was
for
me
but
an
amusing
spectacle
my
heart
was
interested
in
the
future
only
on
one
mysterious
point
the
love
which
i
felt
for
edmee
my
illness
far
from
robbing
me
of
my
physical
vigour
had
but
increased
it
i
was
no
longer
the
heavy
sleepy
animal
fatigued
by
digestion
and
stupefied
by
weariness
i
felt
the
vibrations
of
all
my
fibres
filling
my
soul
with
unknown
harmonies
and
i
was
astonished
to
discover
within
myself
faculties
of
which
i
had
never
suspected
the
use
my
good
kinfolk
were
delighted
at
this
though
apparently
not
surprised
they
had
allowed
themselves
to
augur
so
well
of
me
from
the
beginning
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
been
accustomed
all
their
lives
to
the
trade
of
civilizing
barbarians
the
nervous
system
which
had
just
been
developed
in
me
and
which
made
me
pay
for
the
pleasures
and
advantages
it
brought
by
keen
and
constant
sufferings
during
the
rest
of
my
life
had
rendered
me
specially
sensitive
to
impressions
from
without
and
this
quickness
to
feel
the
effect
of
external
things
was
helped
by
an
organic
vigour
such
as
is
only
found
among
animals
or
savages
i
was
astounded
at
the
decay
of
the
faculties
in
other
people
these
men
in
spectacles
these
women
with
their
sense
of
smell
deadened
by
snuff
these
premature
graybeards
deaf
and
gouty
before
their
time
were
painful
to
behold
to
me
society
seemed
like
a
vast
hospital
and
when
with
my
robust
constitution
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
these
weaklings
it
seemed
to
me
that
with
a
puff
of
my
breath
i
could
have
blown
them
into
the
air
as
if
they
had
been
so
much
this
unfortunately
led
me
into
the
error
of
yielding
to
that
rather
stupid
kind
of
pride
which
makes
a
man
presume
upon
his
natural
gifts
for
a
long
time
it
induced
me
to
neglect
their
real
improvement
as
if
this
were
a
work
of
supererogation
the
idea
that
gradually
grew
up
in
me
of
the
worthlessness
of
my
fellows
prevented
me
from
rising
above
those
whom
i
henceforth
looked
upon
as
my
inferiors
i
did
not
realize
that
society
is
made
up
of
so
many
elements
of
little
value
in
themselves
but
so
skilfully
and
solidly
put
together
that
before
adding
the
least
extraneous
particle
a
man
must
be
a
qualified
artificer
i
did
not
know
that
in
this
society
there
is
no
between
the
role
of
the
great
artist
and
that
of
the
good
workman
now
i
was
neither
one
nor
the
other
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
all
my
ideas
have
never
succeeded
in
lifting
me
out
of
the
ordinary
ruck
all
my
strength
has
only
enabled
me
with
much
difficulty
to
do
as
others
do
in
a
few
weeks
then
i
passed
from
an
excess
of
admiration
to
an
excess
of
contempt
for
society
as
soon
as
i
understood
the
workings
of
its
springs
they
seemed
to
me
so
miserably
regulated
by
a
feeble
generation
that
the
hopes
of
my
mentors
unknown
to
themselves
were
doomed
to
disappointment
instead
of
realizing
my
own
inferiority
and
endeavouring
to
efface
myself
in
the
crowd
i
imagined
that
i
could
give
proof
of
my
superiority
whenever
i
wished
and
i
fed
on
fancies
which
i
blush
to
recall
if
i
did
not
show
myself
egregiously
ridiculous
it
was
thanks
to
the
very
excess
of
this
vanity
which
feared
to
stultify
itself
before
others
at
that
time
paris
presented
a
spectacle
which
i
shall
not
attempt
to
set
before
you
because
no
doubt
you
have
often
eagerly
studied
it
in
the
excellent
pictures
which
have
been
painted
by
in
the
form
of
general
history
or
private
memoirs
besides
such
a
picture
would
exceed
the
limits
of
my
story
for
i
promised
to
tell
you
only
the
cardinal
events
in
my
moral
and
philosophical
development
in
order
to
give
you
some
idea
of
the
workings
of
my
mind
at
this
period
it
will
suffice
to
mention
that
the
war
of
independence
was
breaking
out
in
america
that
voltaire
was
receiving
his
apotheosis
in
paris
that
franklin
the
prophet
of
a
new
political
religion
was
sowing
the
seed
of
liberty
in
the
very
heart
of
the
court
of
france
while
lafayette
was
secretly
preparing
his
romantic
expedition
the
majority
of
young
patricians
were
being
carried
away
either
by
fashion
or
the
love
of
change
or
the
pleasure
inherent
in
all
opposition
which
is
not
dangerous
opposition
took
a
graver
form
and
called
for
more
serious
work
in
the
case
of
the
old
nobles
and
among
the
members
of
the
parliaments
the
spirit
of
the
league
was
alive
again
in
the
ranks
of
these
ancient
patricians
and
these
haughty
magistrates
who
for
form
s
sake
were
still
supporting
the
tottering
monarchy
with
one
arm
while
with
the
other
they
gave
considerable
help
to
the
invasions
of
philosophy
the
privileged
classes
of
society
were
zealously
lending
a
hand
to
the
imminent
destruction
of
their
privileges
by
complaining
that
these
had
been
curtailed
by
the
kings
they
were
bringing
up
their
children
in
constitutional
principles
because
they
imagined
they
were
going
to
found
a
new
monarchy
in
which
the
people
would
help
them
to
regain
their
old
position
above
the
throne
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
greatest
admiration
for
voltaire
and
the
most
ardent
sympathies
with
franklin
were
openly
expressed
in
the
most
famous
salons
in
paris
so
unusual
and
if
it
must
be
said
so
unnatural
a
movement
of
the
human
mind
had
infused
fresh
life
into
the
vestiges
of
the
court
of
louis
xiv
and
replaced
the
customary
coldness
and
stiffness
by
a
sort
of
quarrelsome
vivacity
it
had
also
introduced
certain
serious
forms
into
the
frivolous
manners
of
the
regency
and
lent
them
an
appearance
of
depth
the
pure
but
colourless
life
of
louis
xvi
counted
for
nothing
and
influenced
nobody
never
had
there
been
such
serious
chatter
so
many
flimsy
maxims
such
an
affectation
of
wisdom
so
much
inconsistency
between
words
and
deeds
as
might
have
been
found
at
this
period
among
the
enlightened
classes
it
was
necessary
to
remind
you
of
this
in
order
that
you
might
understand
the
admiration
which
i
had
at
first
for
a
world
apparently
so
disinterested
so
courageous
so
eager
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
and
likewise
the
disgust
which
i
was
soon
to
feel
for
so
much
affectation
and
levity
for
such
an
abuse
of
the
most
hallowed
words
and
the
most
sacred
convictions
for
my
own
part
i
was
perfectly
sincere
and
i
founded
my
philosophic
fervour
that
recently
discovered
sentiment
of
liberty
which
was
then
called
the
cult
of
reason
on
the
broad
base
of
an
inflexible
logic
i
was
young
and
of
a
good
constitution
the
first
condition
perhaps
of
a
healthy
mind
my
reading
though
not
extensive
was
solid
for
i
had
been
fed
on
food
easy
of
digestion
the
little
i
knew
served
to
show
me
therefore
that
others
either
knew
nothing
at
all
or
were
giving
themselves
the
lie
at
the
commencement
of
our
stay
in
paris
the
chevalier
had
but
few
visitors
the
friend
and
contemporary
of
turgot
and
several
other
distinguished
men
he
had
not
mixed
with
the
gilded
youth
of
his
day
but
had
lived
soberly
in
the
country
after
loyally
serving
in
the
wars
his
circle
of
friends
therefore
was
composed
of
a
few
grave
gentlemen
of
the
long
robe
several
old
soldiers
and
a
few
nobles
from
his
own
province
both
old
and
young
who
thanks
to
a
respectable
fortune
were
able
like
himself
to
come
and
spend
the
winter
in
paris
he
had
moreover
kept
up
a
slight
intercourse
with
a
more
brilliant
set
among
whom
edmee
s
beauty
and
refined
manners
were
noticed
as
soon
as
she
appeared
being
an
only
daughter
and
passably
rich
she
was
sought
after
by
various
important
matrons
those
procuresses
of
quality
who
have
always
a
few
young
proteges
whom
they
wish
to
clear
from
debt
at
the
expense
of
some
family
in
the
provinces
and
then
when
it
became
known
that
she
was
engaged
to
de
la
marche
the
almost
ruined
scion
of
a
very
illustrious
family
she
was
still
more
kindly
received
until
by
degrees
the
little
salon
which
she
had
chosen
for
her
father
s
old
friends
became
too
small
for
the
wits
by
quality
and
profession
and
the
grand
ladies
with
a
turn
for
philosophy
who
wished
to
know
the
young
quakeress
the
rose
of
berry
such
were
the
names
given
her
by
a
certain
fashionable
woman
this
rapid
success
in
a
world
in
which
she
had
hitherto
been
unknown
by
no
mean
dazzled
edmee
and
the
control
which
she
possessed
over
herself
was
so
great
that
in
spite
of
all
the
anxiety
with
which
i
watched
her
slightest
movement
i
could
never
discover
if
she
felt
flattered
at
causing
such
a
stir
but
what
i
could
perceive
was
the
admirable
good
sense
manifested
in
everything
she
did
and
everything
she
said
her
manner
at
once
ingenuous
and
reserved
and
a
certain
blending
of
unconstraint
with
modest
pride
made
her
shine
even
among
the
women
who
were
the
most
admired
and
the
most
skilled
in
attracting
attention
and
this
is
the
place
to
mention
that
at
first
i
was
extremely
shocked
at
the
tone
and
bearing
of
these
women
whom
everybody
extolled
to
me
they
seemed
ridiculous
in
their
studied
posings
and
their
grand
society
manners
looked
very
much
like
insufferable
effrontery
yes
i
so
intrepid
at
heart
and
but
lately
so
coarse
in
my
manners
felt
ill
at
ease
and
abashed
in
their
presence
and
it
needed
all
edmee
s
reproaches
and
remonstrances
to
prevent
me
from
displaying
a
profound
contempt
for
this
meretriciousness
of
glances
of
toilets
and
allurements
which
was
known
in
society
as
allowable
coquetry
as
the
charming
desire
to
please
as
amiability
and
as
grace
the
abbe
was
of
my
opinion
when
the
guests
had
gone
we
members
of
the
family
used
to
gather
round
the
fireside
for
a
short
while
before
separating
it
is
at
such
a
time
that
one
feels
an
impulse
to
bring
together
one
s
scattered
impressions
and
communicate
them
to
some
sympathetic
being
the
abbe
then
would
break
the
same
lances
as
myself
with
my
uncle
and
cousin
the
chevalier
who
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
the
fair
sex
of
which
he
had
had
but
little
experience
used
to
take
upon
himself
like
a
true
french
knight
to
defend
all
the
beauties
that
we
were
attacking
so
unmercifully
he
would
laughingly
accuse
the
abbe
of
arguing
about
women
as
the
fox
in
the
fable
argued
about
the
grapes
for
myself
i
used
to
improve
under
the
abbe
s
criticisms
this
was
an
emphatic
way
of
letting
edmee
know
how
much
i
preferred
her
to
all
others
she
however
appeared
to
be
more
scandalized
than
flattered
and
seriously
reproved
me
for
the
tendency
to
malevolence
which
had
its
origin
she
said
in
my
inordinate
pride
it
is
true
that
after
generously
undertaking
the
defence
of
the
persons
in
question
she
would
come
over
to
our
opinion
as
soon
as
rousseau
in
hand
we
told
her
that
the
women
in
paris
society
had
cavalier
manners
and
a
way
of
looking
a
man
in
the
face
which
must
needs
be
intolerable
in
the
eyes
of
a
sage
when
once
rousseau
had
delivered
judgment
edmee
would
object
no
further
she
was
ready
to
admit
with
him
that
the
greatest
charm
of
a
woman
is
the
intelligent
and
modest
attention
she
gives
to
serious
discussions
and
i
always
used
to
remind
her
of
the
comparison
of
a
superior
woman
to
a
beautiful
child
with
its
great
eyes
full
of
feeling
and
sweetness
and
delicacy
with
its
shy
questionings
and
its
objections
full
of
sense
i
hoped
that
she
would
recognise
herself
in
this
portrait
upon
the
text
and
enlarging
the
portrait
a
really
superior
woman
i
said
looking
at
her
earnestly
is
one
who
knows
enough
to
prevent
her
from
asking
a
ridiculous
or
unseasonable
question
or
from
ever
measuring
swords
with
men
of
merit
such
a
woman
knows
when
to
be
silent
especially
with
the
fools
whom
she
could
laugh
at
or
the
ignorant
whom
she
could
humiliate
she
is
indulgent
towards
absurdities
because
she
does
not
yearn
to
display
her
knowledge
and
she
is
observant
of
whatsoever
is
good
because
she
desires
to
improve
herself
her
great
object
is
to
understand
not
to
instruct
the
great
art
since
it
is
recognised
that
art
is
required
even
in
the
commerce
of
words
is
not
to
pit
against
one
another
two
arrogant
opponents
eager
to
parade
their
learning
and
to
amuse
the
company
by
discussing
questions
the
solution
of
which
no
one
troubles
about
but
to
illumine
every
unprofitable
disputation
by
bringing
in
the
help
of
all
who
can
throw
a
little
light
on
the
points
at
issue
this
is
a
talent
of
which
i
can
see
no
signs
among
the
hostesses
who
are
so
cried
up
in
their
houses
i
always
find
two
fashionable
barristers
and
a
thunderstruck
audience
in
which
no
one
dares
to
be
judge
the
only
art
these
ladies
have
is
to
make
the
man
of
genius
ridiculous
and
the
ordinary
man
dumb
and
inert
one
comes
away
from
such
houses
saying
those
were
fine
speeches
and
nothing
i
really
think
that
i
was
in
the
right
here
but
i
can
not
forget
that
my
chief
cause
of
anger
against
these
women
arose
from
the
fact
that
they
paid
no
attention
to
people
however
able
they
might
think
themselves
unless
they
happened
to
be
famous
the
being
myself
as
you
may
easily
imagine
on
the
other
hand
now
that
i
look
back
on
those
days
without
prejudice
and
without
any
sense
of
wounded
vanity
i
am
certain
that
these
women
had
a
way
of
fawning
on
public
favourites
which
was
much
more
like
childish
conceit
than
sincere
admiration
or
candid
sympathy
they
became
editors
as
it
were
of
the
conversation
listening
with
all
their
might
and
making
peremptory
signals
to
the
audience
to
listen
to
every
triviality
issuing
from
an
illustrious
mouth
while
they
would
suppress
a
yawn
and
drum
with
their
fans
at
all
remarks
however
excellent
as
soon
as
they
were
unsigned
by
a
fashionable
name
i
am
ignorant
of
the
airs
of
the
intellectual
women
of
the
nineteenth
century
nay
i
do
not
know
if
the
race
still
exists
thirty
years
have
passed
since
i
mixed
in
society
but
as
to
the
past
you
may
believe
what
i
tell
you
there
were
five
or
six
of
these
women
who
were
absolutely
odious
to
me
one
of
them
had
some
wit
and
scattered
her
epigrams
right
and
left
these
were
at
once
hawked
about
in
all
and
i
had
to
listen
to
them
twenty
times
in
a
single
day
another
had
read
montesquieu
and
gave
lessons
in
law
to
the
oldest
magistrates
a
third
used
to
play
the
harp
execrably
but
it
was
agreed
that
her
arms
were
the
most
beautiful
in
france
and
we
had
to
endure
the
harsh
scraping
of
her
nails
over
the
strings
so
that
she
might
have
an
opportunity
of
removing
her
gloves
like
a
coy
little
girl
what
can
i
say
of
the
others
except
that
they
vied
with
one
another
in
all
those
affectations
and
fatuous
insincerities
by
which
all
the
men
childishly
allowed
themselves
to
be
duped
one
alone
was
really
pretty
said
nothing
and
gave
pleasure
by
her
very
lack
of
artificiality
to
her
i
might
have
been
favourably
inclined
because
of
her
ignorance
had
she
not
gloried
in
this
and
tried
to
emphasize
her
difference
from
the
others
by
a
piquant
ingenuousness
one
day
i
discovered
that
she
had
plenty
of
wit
and
straightway
i
abhorred
her
edmee
alone
preserved
all
the
freshness
of
sincerity
and
all
the
distinction
of
natural
grace
sitting
on
a
sofa
by
the
side
of
de
malesherbes
she
was
for
me
the
same
being
that
i
had
gazed
on
so
many
times
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
as
she
sat
on
the
stone
seat
at
the
door
of
patience
s
cottage
xiii
you
will
readily
believe
that
all
the
homage
paid
to
my
cousin
fanned
into
fresh
flames
the
jealousy
which
had
been
smouldering
in
my
breast
since
the
day
when
in
obedience
to
her
command
i
began
to
devote
myself
to
work
i
could
hardly
say
whether
i
had
dared
to
count
on
her
promise
that
she
would
become
my
wife
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
understand
her
ideas
and
feelings
to
me
indeed
it
seemed
that
the
time
for
this
had
already
arrived
for
it
is
certain
that
i
understood
edmee
better
perhaps
than
any
of
the
men
who
were
paying
their
addresses
to
her
in
prose
and
verse
i
had
firmly
resolved
not
to
presume
upon
the
oath
extorted
from
her
at
yet
when
i
remembered
her
last
promise
freely
given
at
the
chapel
window
and
the
inferences
which
i
could
have
drawn
from
her
conversation
with
the
abbe
which
i
had
overheard
in
the
parlour
at
when
i
remembered
her
earnestness
in
preventing
me
from
going
away
and
in
directing
my
education
the
motherly
attentions
she
had
lavished
on
me
during
my
illness
did
not
all
these
things
give
me
if
not
some
right
at
least
some
reason
to
hope
it
is
true
that
her
friendship
would
become
icy
as
soon
as
my
passion
betrayed
itself
in
words
or
looks
it
is
true
that
since
the
first
day
i
saw
her
i
had
not
advanced
a
single
step
towards
close
affection
it
is
also
true
that
de
la
marche
frequently
came
to
the
house
and
that
she
always
showed
him
as
much
friendship
as
myself
though
with
less
familiarity
and
more
respect
in
it
a
distinction
which
was
naturally
due
to
the
difference
in
our
characters
and
our
ages
and
did
not
indicate
any
preference
for
one
or
the
other
it
was
possible
therefore
to
attribute
her
promise
to
the
prompting
of
her
conscience
the
interest
which
she
took
in
my
studies
to
her
worship
of
human
dignity
as
it
stood
rehabilitated
by
philosophy
her
quiet
and
continued
affection
for
de
la
march
to
a
profound
regret
kept
in
subjection
by
the
strength
and
wisdom
of
her
mind
these
perplexities
i
felt
very
acutely
the
hope
of
compelling
her
love
by
submission
and
devotion
had
sustained
me
but
this
hope
was
beginning
to
grow
weak
for
though
as
all
allowed
i
had
made
prodigious
efforts
and
extraordinary
progress
edmee
s
regard
for
me
had
been
very
far
from
increasing
in
the
same
proportion
she
had
not
shown
any
astonishment
at
what
she
called
my
lofty
intellect
she
had
always
believed
in
it
she
had
praised
it
unreasonably
but
she
was
not
blind
to
the
faults
in
my
character
to
the
vices
of
my
soul
she
had
reproached
me
with
these
with
an
inexorable
sweetness
with
a
patience
calculated
to
drive
me
to
despair
for
she
seemed
to
have
made
up
her
mind
that
whatever
the
future
might
bring
she
would
never
love
me
more
and
never
less
meanwhile
all
were
paying
court
to
her
and
none
were
accepted
it
had
indeed
been
given
out
that
she
was
engaged
to
de
la
marche
but
no
one
understood
any
better
than
myself
the
indefinite
postponement
of
the
marriage
people
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
seeking
a
pretext
to
get
rid
of
him
and
they
could
find
no
ground
for
her
repugnance
except
by
supposing
that
she
had
conceived
a
great
passion
for
myself
my
strange
history
had
caused
some
stir
the
women
examined
me
with
curiosity
the
men
seemed
interested
in
me
and
showed
me
a
sort
of
respect
which
i
affected
to
despise
but
to
which
however
i
was
far
from
insensible
and
since
nothing
finds
credence
in
the
world
until
it
is
embellished
with
some
fiction
people
strangely
exaggerated
my
wit
my
capabilities
and
my
learning
but
as
soon
as
they
had
seen
de
la
marche
and
myself
in
edmee
s
company
all
their
inferences
were
annihilated
by
the
composure
and
ease
of
our
manners
to
both
of
us
edmee
was
the
same
in
public
as
in
private
de
la
marche
a
soulless
puppet
was
perfectly
drilled
in
conventional
manners
and
myself
a
prey
to
divers
passions
but
inscrutable
by
reason
of
my
pride
and
also
i
must
confess
of
my
pretensions
to
the
sublimity
of
the
i
should
tell
you
that
i
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
be
introduced
to
franklin
as
a
sincere
devotee
of
liberty
sir
arthur
lee
had
honoured
me
with
a
certain
kindness
and
some
excellent
advice
consequently
my
head
was
somewhat
turned
even
as
the
heads
of
those
whom
i
railed
at
so
bitterly
were
turned
and
to
such
an
extent
that
this
little
vainglory
brought
sorely
needed
relief
to
my
agonies
of
mind
perhaps
you
will
shrug
your
shoulders
when
i
own
that
i
took
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
in
leaving
my
hair
unpowdered
in
wearing
big
shoes
and
appearing
everywhere
in
a
coat
of
aggressively
simple
cut
and
stiffly
neat
in
a
word
in
aping
as
far
as
was
then
permissible
without
being
mistaken
for
a
regular
plebeian
the
dress
and
ways
of
the
bonhomme
richard
i
was
nineteen
and
i
was
living
in
an
age
when
every
one
affected
a
part
that
is
my
only
excuse
i
might
plead
also
that
my
too
indulgent
and
too
simple
tutor
openly
approved
of
my
conduct
that
my
uncle
hubert
though
he
occasionally
laughed
at
me
let
me
do
as
i
wished
and
that
edmee
said
absolutely
nothing
about
this
ridiculous
affectation
and
appeared
never
to
notice
it
meanwhile
spring
had
returned
we
were
going
back
to
the
country
the
salons
were
being
gradually
deserted
for
myself
i
was
still
in
the
same
state
of
uncertainty
i
noticed
one
day
that
de
la
marche
seemed
anxious
to
find
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
edmee
in
private
at
first
i
found
pleasure
in
making
him
suffer
and
did
not
stir
from
my
chair
however
i
thought
i
detected
on
edmee
s
brow
that
slight
frown
which
i
knew
so
well
and
after
a
silent
dialogue
with
myself
i
went
out
of
the
room
resolving
to
observe
the
results
of
this
and
to
learn
my
fate
whatever
it
might
be
at
the
end
of
an
hour
i
returned
to
the
my
uncle
was
there
de
la
marche
was
staying
to
dinner
edmee
seemed
meditative
but
not
melancholy
the
abbe
s
eyes
were
putting
questions
to
her
which
she
did
not
understand
or
did
not
wish
to
understand
de
la
marche
accompanied
my
uncle
to
the
comedie
francaise
edmee
said
that
she
had
some
letters
to
write
and
requested
permission
to
remain
at
home
i
followed
the
count
and
the
chevalier
but
after
the
first
act
i
made
my
escape
and
returned
to
the
house
edmee
had
given
orders
that
she
was
not
to
be
disturbed
but
i
did
not
consider
that
this
applied
to
myself
the
servants
thought
it
quite
natural
that
i
should
behave
as
the
son
of
the
house
i
entered
the
fearful
lest
edmee
should
have
retired
to
her
for
there
i
could
not
have
followed
her
she
was
sitting
near
the
fire
and
amusing
herself
by
pulling
out
the
petals
of
the
blue
and
white
asters
which
i
had
gathered
during
a
walk
to
the
tomb
of
jean
jacques
rousseau
these
flowers
brought
back
to
me
a
night
of
ecstasy
under
the
clear
moonlight
the
only
hours
of
happiness
perhaps
that
i
could
mention
in
all
my
life
back
already
she
said
without
any
change
of
attitude
already
is
an
unkind
word
i
replied
would
you
like
me
to
retire
to
my
room
edmee
by
no
means
you
are
not
disturbing
me
at
all
but
you
would
have
derived
more
profit
from
seeing
than
from
listening
to
my
conversation
this
evening
for
i
warn
you
that
i
feel
a
complete
so
much
the
better
cousin
i
shall
not
feel
humiliated
this
evening
since
for
the
first
time
we
shall
be
upon
a
footing
of
equality
but
might
i
ask
you
why
you
so
despise
my
asters
i
thought
that
you
would
probably
keep
them
as
a
of
rousseau
she
asked
with
a
malicious
little
smile
and
without
raising
her
eyes
to
mine
naturally
that
was
my
meaning
i
answered
i
am
playing
a
most
interesting
game
she
said
do
not
interrupt
i
know
it
i
said
all
the
children
in
varenne
play
it
and
there
is
not
a
lass
but
believes
in
the
decree
of
fate
that
it
revels
would
you
like
me
to
read
your
thoughts
as
you
pull
out
these
petals
four
by
four
come
then
o
mighty
magician
a
little
that
is
how
some
one
loves
you
much
that
is
how
you
love
him
passionately
that
is
how
another
loves
you
not
at
all
thus
do
you
love
this
and
might
i
inquire
sir
oracle
replied
edmee
whose
face
became
more
serious
who
some
one
and
another
may
be
i
suspect
that
you
are
like
the
pythonesses
of
old
you
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
your
auguries
could
you
not
guess
mine
edmee
i
will
try
to
interpret
the
riddle
if
you
will
promise
that
afterward
you
will
do
what
the
sphinx
did
when
vanquished
by
oh
edmee
i
cried
think
how
long
i
have
been
running
my
head
against
walls
on
account
of
you
and
your
interpretations
and
yet
you
have
not
guessed
right
a
single
oh
good
heavens
i
have
she
said
throwing
the
bouquet
on
to
the
you
shall
see
i
love
de
la
marche
a
little
and
i
love
you
much
he
loves
me
passionately
and
you
love
me
not
at
all
that
is
the
i
forgive
you
this
malicious
interpretation
with
all
my
heart
for
the
sake
of
the
word
much
i
replied
i
tried
to
take
her
hands
she
drew
them
away
quickly
though
in
fact
she
had
no
need
to
fear
for
had
she
given
me
them
i
merely
intended
to
press
them
in
brotherly
fashion
but
this
appearance
of
distrust
aroused
memories
which
were
dangerous
for
me
i
fancy
she
showed
a
great
deal
of
coquetry
that
evening
in
her
expression
and
manners
and
until
then
i
had
never
seen
the
least
inclination
toward
it
i
felt
my
courage
rising
though
i
could
not
explain
why
and
i
ventured
on
some
pointed
remarks
about
her
interview
with
de
la
marche
she
made
no
effort
to
deny
my
interpretations
and
began
to
laugh
when
i
told
her
that
she
ought
to
thank
me
for
my
exquisite
politeness
in
retiring
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
knit
her
brow
her
supercilious
levity
was
beginning
to
irritate
me
a
little
when
a
servant
entered
and
handed
her
a
letter
saying
that
some
one
was
waiting
for
an
answer
go
to
my
and
cut
a
pen
for
me
please
she
said
to
me
with
an
air
of
unconcern
she
broke
the
seal
and
ran
through
the
letter
while
i
quite
ignorant
of
the
contents
began
preparing
her
writing
materials
for
some
time
the
had
been
cut
ready
for
use
for
some
time
the
paper
with
its
coloured
vignette
had
been
waiting
by
the
side
of
the
amber
yet
edmee
paid
no
attention
to
them
and
made
no
attempt
to
use
them
the
letter
lay
open
in
her
lap
her
feet
were
on
the
her
elbows
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
in
her
favourite
attitude
of
meditation
she
was
completely
absorbed
i
spoke
to
her
softly
she
did
not
hear
me
i
thought
that
she
had
forgotten
the
letter
and
had
fallen
asleep
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
servant
came
back
and
said
that
the
messenger
wished
to
know
if
there
was
any
answer
certainly
she
replied
ask
him
to
she
read
the
letter
again
with
the
closest
attention
and
began
to
write
slowly
then
she
threw
her
reply
into
the
fire
pushed
away
the
with
her
foot
walked
round
the
room
a
few
times
and
suddenly
stopped
in
front
of
me
and
looked
at
me
in
a
cold
hard
manner
edmee
i
cried
springing
to
me
feet
what
is
the
matter
and
how
does
that
letter
which
is
worrying
you
so
much
concern
myself
what
is
that
to
you
she
replied
what
is
that
to
me
i
cried
and
what
is
the
air
i
breathe
to
me
and
what
is
the
blood
that
flows
in
my
veins
ask
me
that
if
you
like
but
do
not
ask
how
one
of
your
words
or
one
of
your
glances
can
concern
me
for
you
know
very
well
that
my
life
depends
on
do
not
talk
nonsense
now
bernard
she
answered
returning
to
her
in
a
distracted
manner
there
is
a
time
for
edmee
edmee
do
not
play
with
the
sleeping
lion
do
not
stir
up
the
fire
which
is
smouldering
in
the
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
began
to
write
with
great
rapidity
her
face
was
flushed
and
from
time
to
time
she
passed
her
fingers
through
the
long
hair
which
fell
in
ringlets
over
her
shoulders
she
was
dangerously
beautiful
in
her
agitation
she
looked
as
if
in
love
but
with
whom
doubtless
with
him
to
whom
she
was
writing
i
began
to
feel
the
fires
of
jealousy
i
walked
out
of
the
room
abruptly
and
crossed
the
hall
i
looked
at
the
man
who
had
brought
the
letter
he
was
in
de
la
marche
s
livery
i
had
no
further
doubts
this
however
only
increased
my
rage
i
returned
to
the
and
threw
open
the
door
violently
edmee
did
not
even
turn
her
head
she
continued
writing
i
sat
down
opposite
her
and
stared
at
her
with
flashing
eyes
she
did
not
deign
to
raise
her
own
to
mine
i
even
fancied
that
i
noticed
on
her
ruby
lips
the
dawn
of
a
smile
which
seemed
an
insult
to
my
agony
at
last
she
finished
her
letter
and
sealed
it
i
rose
and
walked
towards
her
feeling
strongly
tempted
to
snatch
it
from
her
hands
i
had
learnt
to
control
myself
somewhat
better
than
of
old
but
i
realized
how
with
passionate
souls
a
single
instant
may
destroy
the
labours
of
many
days
edmee
i
said
to
her
in
a
bitter
tone
and
with
a
frightful
grimace
that
was
intended
to
be
a
sarcastic
smile
would
you
like
me
to
hand
this
letter
to
de
la
marche
s
lackey
and
at
the
same
time
tell
him
in
a
whisper
at
what
time
his
master
may
come
to
the
tryst
it
seems
to
me
she
replied
with
a
calmness
that
exasperated
me
that
it
was
possible
to
mention
the
time
in
my
letter
and
that
there
is
no
need
to
inform
a
servant
of
edmee
you
ought
to
be
a
little
more
considerate
of
me
i
cried
that
doesn
t
trouble
me
the
least
in
the
world
she
replied
and
throwing
me
the
letter
she
had
received
across
the
table
she
went
out
to
give
the
answer
to
the
messenger
herself
i
do
not
know
whether
she
had
told
me
to
read
this
letter
but
i
do
know
that
the
impulse
which
urged
me
to
do
so
was
irresistible
it
ran
somewhat
as
follows
edmee
i
have
at
last
discovered
the
fatal
secret
which
according
to
you
sets
an
impassable
barrier
in
the
way
of
our
union
bernard
loves
you
his
agitation
this
morning
betrayed
him
but
you
do
not
love
him
i
am
sure
that
would
be
impossible
you
would
have
told
me
frankly
the
obstacle
then
must
be
elsewhere
forgive
me
it
has
come
to
my
knowledge
that
you
spent
two
hours
in
the
brigand
s
den
unhappy
girl
your
misfortune
your
prudence
your
sublime
delicacy
make
you
still
nobler
in
my
eyes
and
why
did
you
not
confide
to
me
at
once
the
misfortune
of
which
you
were
a
victim
i
could
have
eased
your
sorrow
and
my
own
by
a
word
i
could
have
helped
you
to
hide
your
secret
i
could
have
wept
with
you
or
rather
i
could
have
wiped
out
the
odious
recollection
by
displaying
an
attachment
proof
against
anything
but
there
is
no
need
to
despair
there
is
still
time
to
say
this
word
and
i
do
so
now
edmee
i
love
you
more
than
ever
more
than
ever
i
am
resolved
to
offer
you
my
name
will
you
deign
to
accept
it
this
note
was
signed
adhemar
de
la
marche
i
had
scarcely
finished
reading
it
when
edmee
returned
and
came
towards
the
with
an
anxious
look
as
if
she
had
forgotten
some
precious
object
i
handed
her
the
letter
that
i
had
just
read
but
she
took
it
absently
and
stooping
over
the
hearth
with
an
air
of
relief
eagerly
seized
a
crumpled
piece
of
paper
which
the
flames
had
merely
scorched
this
was
the
first
answer
she
had
written
to
de
la
marche
s
note
the
one
she
had
not
judged
fit
to
send
edmee
i
said
throwing
myself
on
my
knees
let
me
see
that
letter
whatever
if
may
be
i
will
submit
to
the
decree
dictated
by
your
first
you
really
would
she
asked
with
an
indefinable
expression
supposing
i
loved
de
la
marche
and
that
i
was
making
a
great
sacrifice
for
your
sake
in
refusing
him
would
you
be
generous
enough
to
release
me
from
my
word
i
hesitated
for
a
moment
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
all
over
me
i
looked
her
full
in
the
face
but
her
eyes
were
inscrutable
and
betrayed
no
hint
of
her
thoughts
if
i
had
fancied
that
she
really
loved
me
and
that
she
was
putting
my
virtue
to
the
test
i
should
perhaps
have
played
the
hero
but
i
was
afraid
of
some
trap
my
passion
overmastered
me
i
felt
that
i
had
not
the
strength
to
renounce
my
claim
with
a
good
grace
and
hypocrisy
was
repugnant
to
me
i
rose
to
my
feet
trembling
with
rage
you
love
him
i
cried
confess
that
you
love
him
and
if
i
did
she
answered
putting
the
letter
in
her
pocket
where
would
be
the
crime
the
crime
would
be
that
hitherto
you
have
lied
in
telling
me
that
you
did
not
love
hitherto
is
saying
a
good
deal
she
rejoined
looking
at
me
fixedly
we
have
not
discussed
the
matter
since
last
year
at
that
time
it
was
possible
that
i
did
not
love
adhemar
very
much
and
at
present
it
might
be
possible
that
i
loved
him
more
than
you
if
i
compare
the
conduct
of
both
i
see
on
the
one
hand
a
man
without
proper
pride
and
without
delicacy
presuming
upon
a
promise
which
my
heart
perhaps
has
never
ratified
on
the
other
i
see
an
admirable
friend
whose
sublime
devotion
is
ready
to
brave
all
prejudices
who
believing
that
i
bear
the
smirch
of
an
indelible
shame
is
none
the
less
prepared
to
cover
the
blot
with
his
what
this
wretch
believes
that
i
have
done
violence
to
you
and
yet
does
not
challenge
me
to
a
duel
that
is
not
what
he
believes
bernard
he
knows
that
you
rescued
me
from
but
he
thinks
that
you
helped
me
too
late
and
that
i
was
the
victim
of
the
other
and
he
wants
to
marry
you
edmee
either
the
man
s
devotion
is
sublime
as
you
say
or
he
is
deeper
in
debt
than
you
how
dare
you
say
that
said
edmee
angrily
such
an
odious
explanation
of
generous
conduct
can
proceed
only
from
an
unfeeling
soul
or
a
perverse
mind
be
silent
unless
you
wish
me
to
hate
say
that
you
hate
me
edmee
say
so
without
fear
i
know
without
fear
you
should
know
likewise
that
i
have
not
yet
done
you
the
honour
to
fear
you
however
tell
me
this
without
inquiring
into
what
i
intend
to
do
can
you
understand
that
you
ought
to
give
me
my
liberty
and
abandon
your
barbarous
rights
i
understand
nothing
except
that
i
love
you
madly
and
that
these
nails
of
mine
shall
tear
out
the
heart
of
any
man
who
tries
to
win
you
from
me
i
know
that
i
shall
force
you
to
love
me
and
that
if
i
do
not
succeed
i
will
at
any
rate
not
let
you
belong
to
another
while
i
am
alive
the
man
will
have
to
walk
over
my
body
riddled
with
wounds
and
bleeding
from
every
pore
ere
he
can
put
the
on
your
finger
with
my
last
breath
too
i
will
dishonour
you
by
proclaiming
that
you
are
my
mistress
and
thus
cloud
the
joy
of
any
man
who
may
triumph
over
me
and
if
i
can
stab
you
as
i
die
i
will
so
that
in
the
tomb
at
least
you
may
be
my
wife
that
is
what
i
purpose
doing
edmee
and
now
practise
all
your
arts
on
me
lead
me
on
from
trap
to
trap
rule
me
with
your
admirable
diplomacy
i
may
be
duped
a
hundred
times
because
of
my
ignorance
but
have
i
not
sworn
by
the
name
of
mauprat
mauprat
the
hamstringer
she
added
with
freezing
irony
and
she
turned
to
go
out
i
was
about
to
seize
her
arm
when
the
bell
rang
it
was
the
abbe
who
had
returned
as
soon
as
he
appeared
edmee
shook
hands
with
him
and
retired
to
her
room
without
saying
a
single
word
to
me
the
good
abbe
noticing
my
agitation
questioned
me
with
that
assurance
which
his
claims
on
my
affections
were
henceforth
to
give
him
the
present
matter
however
was
the
only
one
on
which
we
had
never
had
an
explanation
in
vain
had
he
sought
to
introduce
it
he
had
not
given
me
a
single
lesson
in
history
without
leading
up
to
some
famous
love
affairs
and
drawing
from
them
an
example
or
a
precept
of
moderation
or
generosity
but
he
had
not
succeeded
in
making
me
breathe
a
word
on
this
subject
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
forgive
him
altogether
for
having
done
me
an
ill
turn
with
edmee
i
even
had
a
suspicion
that
he
was
still
injuring
my
cause
and
i
therefore
put
myself
on
guard
against
all
the
arguments
of
his
philosophy
and
all
the
seductions
of
his
friendship
on
this
special
evening
i
was
more
unassailable
than
ever
i
left
him
ill
at
ease
and
depressed
and
went
and
threw
myself
on
my
bed
where
i
buried
my
head
in
the
clothes
so
as
to
stifle
the
customary
sobs
those
pitiless
conquerors
of
my
pride
and
my
rage
xiv
the
next
day
i
was
in
a
state
of
gloomy
despair
edmee
was
icily
cold
de
la
marche
did
not
come
i
fancied
i
had
seen
the
abbe
going
to
call
on
him
and
subsequently
telling
edmee
the
result
of
their
interview
however
they
betrayed
no
signs
of
agitation
and
i
had
to
endure
my
suspense
in
silence
i
could
not
get
a
minute
with
edmee
alone
in
the
morning
i
went
on
foot
to
de
la
marche
s
house
what
i
intended
saying
to
him
i
do
not
know
my
state
of
exasperation
was
such
that
it
drove
me
to
act
without
either
object
or
plan
having
learnt
that
he
had
left
paris
i
returned
i
found
my
uncle
very
depressed
on
seeing
me
he
frowned
and
after
forcing
himself
to
exchange
a
few
meaningless
words
with
me
left
me
to
the
abbe
who
tried
to
draw
me
on
to
speak
but
succeeded
no
better
than
the
night
before
for
several
days
i
sought
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
edmee
but
she
always
managed
to
avoid
it
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
return
to
she
seemed
neither
sorry
nor
pleased
at
the
prospect
i
determined
to
slip
a
note
between
the
page
of
her
book
asking
for
an
interview
within
five
minutes
i
received
the
following
reply
an
interview
would
lead
to
nothing
you
are
persisting
in
your
boorish
behaviour
i
shall
persevere
in
what
i
believe
to
be
the
path
of
integrity
an
upright
conscience
can
not
go
from
its
word
i
had
sworn
never
to
be
any
man
s
but
yours
i
shall
not
marry
for
i
did
not
swear
that
i
would
be
yours
whatever
might
happen
if
you
continue
to
be
unworthy
of
my
esteem
i
shall
take
steps
to
remain
free
my
poor
father
is
sinking
into
the
grave
a
convent
shall
be
my
refuge
when
the
only
tie
which
binds
me
to
the
world
is
i
had
fulfilled
all
the
conditions
imposed
by
edmee
and
now
it
seemed
her
only
return
was
an
order
that
i
should
break
them
i
thus
found
myself
in
the
same
position
as
on
the
day
of
her
conversation
with
the
abbe
i
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
shut
up
in
my
room
all
through
the
night
i
walked
up
and
down
in
violent
agitation
i
made
no
effort
to
sleep
i
will
not
tell
you
the
thoughts
that
passed
through
my
mind
they
were
not
unworthy
of
an
honest
man
at
daybreak
i
was
at
lafayette
s
house
he
procured
me
the
necessary
papers
for
leaving
france
he
told
me
to
go
and
await
him
in
spain
whence
he
was
going
to
sail
for
the
united
states
i
returned
to
our
house
to
get
the
clothes
and
money
indispensable
to
the
humblest
of
travellers
i
left
a
note
for
my
uncle
so
that
he
might
not
feel
uneasy
at
my
absence
this
i
promised
to
explain
very
soon
in
a
long
letter
i
begged
him
to
refrain
from
passing
sentence
on
me
until
it
arrived
and
assured
him
that
i
should
never
forget
all
his
goodness
i
left
before
any
one
in
the
house
was
up
for
i
was
afraid
that
my
resolution
might
be
shaken
at
the
least
sign
of
friendship
and
i
felt
that
i
could
no
longer
impose
upon
a
too
generous
affection
i
could
not
however
pass
edmee
s
door
without
pressing
my
lips
to
the
lock
then
hiding
my
head
in
my
hands
i
rushed
away
like
a
madman
and
scarcely
stopped
until
i
had
reached
the
other
side
of
the
pyrenees
there
i
took
a
short
rest
and
wrote
to
edmee
that
as
far
as
concerned
myself
she
was
free
that
i
would
not
thwart
a
single
wish
of
hers
but
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
be
a
witness
of
my
rival
s
triumph
i
felt
firmly
convinced
that
she
loved
him
and
i
resolved
to
crush
out
my
own
love
i
was
promising
more
than
i
could
perform
but
these
first
manifestations
of
wounded
pride
gave
me
confidence
in
myself
i
also
wrote
to
my
uncle
to
tell
him
i
should
not
hold
myself
worthy
of
the
boundless
affection
he
had
bestowed
on
me
until
i
had
won
my
spurs
as
a
knight
i
confided
to
him
my
hopes
of
a
soldier
s
fame
and
fortune
with
all
the
candour
of
conceit
and
since
i
felt
sure
that
edmee
would
read
this
letter
i
feigned
unclouded
delight
and
an
ardour
that
knew
no
regrets
i
did
not
know
whether
my
uncle
was
aware
of
the
real
cause
of
my
departure
but
my
pride
could
not
bring
itself
to
confess
it
was
the
same
with
the
abbe
to
whom
i
likewise
wrote
a
letter
full
of
gratitude
and
affection
i
ended
by
begging
my
uncle
to
put
himself
to
no
expense
on
my
account
over
the
gloomy
keep
at
assuring
him
that
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
live
there
i
urged
him
to
consider
the
fief
as
his
daughter
s
property
and
only
asked
that
he
would
be
good
enough
to
advance
me
my
share
of
the
income
for
two
or
three
years
so
that
i
might
pay
the
expenses
of
my
own
outfit
and
thus
prevent
my
devotion
to
the
american
cause
from
being
a
burden
to
the
noble
lafayette
my
conduct
and
my
letters
apparently
gave
satisfaction
soon
after
i
reached
the
coast
of
spain
i
received
from
my
uncle
a
letter
full
of
kindly
exhortations
and
of
mild
censure
for
my
abrupt
departure
he
gave
me
a
father
s
blessing
and
declared
on
his
honour
that
the
fief
of
would
never
be
accepted
by
edmee
and
sent
me
a
considerable
sum
of
money
exclusive
of
the
income
due
me
in
the
future
the
abbe
expressed
the
same
mild
censure
together
with
still
warmer
exhortations
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
preferred
edmee
s
tranquility
to
my
happiness
and
that
he
was
full
of
genuine
joy
at
my
departure
nevertheless
he
had
a
liking
for
me
and
his
friendship
showed
itself
touchingly
through
the
cruel
satisfaction
that
was
mingled
with
it
he
expressed
envy
of
my
lot
proclaimed
his
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
of
independence
and
declared
that
he
himself
had
more
than
once
felt
tempted
to
throw
off
the
cassock
and
take
up
the
musket
all
this
however
was
mere
boyish
affectation
his
timid
gentle
nature
always
kept
him
the
priest
under
the
mask
of
the
philosopher
between
these
two
letters
i
found
a
little
note
without
any
address
which
seemed
as
if
it
had
been
slipped
in
as
an
i
was
not
slow
to
see
that
it
was
from
the
one
person
in
the
world
who
was
of
real
interest
to
me
yet
i
had
not
the
courage
to
open
it
i
walked
up
and
down
the
sandy
beach
turning
over
this
little
piece
of
paper
in
my
hands
fearful
that
by
reading
it
i
might
destroy
the
kind
of
desperate
calm
my
resolution
had
given
me
above
all
i
dreaded
lest
it
might
contain
expressions
of
thanks
and
enthusiastic
joy
behind
which
i
should
have
divined
the
rapture
of
contented
love
for
another
what
can
she
be
writing
to
me
about
i
said
to
myself
why
does
she
write
at
all
i
do
not
want
her
pity
still
less
her
i
felt
tempted
to
throw
this
fateful
little
note
into
the
sea
once
indeed
i
held
it
out
over
the
waves
but
i
immediately
pressed
it
to
my
bosom
and
kept
it
hidden
there
a
few
moments
as
if
i
had
been
a
believer
in
that
second
sight
preached
by
the
advocates
of
magnetism
who
assert
that
they
can
read
with
the
organs
of
feeling
and
thought
as
well
as
with
their
eyes
at
last
i
resolved
to
break
the
seal
the
words
i
read
were
these
you
have
done
well
bernard
but
i
give
you
no
thanks
as
your
absence
will
cause
me
more
suffering
than
i
can
tell
still
go
wherever
honour
and
love
of
truth
call
you
you
will
always
be
followed
by
my
good
wishes
and
prayers
return
when
your
mission
is
accomplished
you
will
find
me
neither
married
nor
in
a
in
this
note
she
had
inclosed
the
cornelian
ring
she
had
given
me
during
my
illness
and
which
i
had
returned
on
leaving
paris
i
had
a
little
gold
box
made
to
hold
this
ring
and
note
and
i
wore
it
near
my
heart
as
a
talisman
lafayette
who
had
been
arrested
in
france
by
order
of
the
government
which
was
opposed
to
his
expedition
soon
came
and
joined
us
after
escaping
from
prison
i
had
had
time
to
make
my
preparations
and
i
sailed
full
of
melancholy
ambition
and
hope
you
will
not
expect
me
to
give
an
account
of
the
american
war
once
again
i
will
separate
my
existence
from
the
events
of
history
as
i
relate
my
own
adventures
here
however
i
shall
suppress
even
my
personal
adventures
in
my
memory
these
form
a
special
chapter
in
which
edmee
plays
the
part
of
a
madonna
constantly
invoked
but
invisible
i
can
not
think
that
you
would
be
the
least
interested
in
listening
to
a
portion
of
my
narrative
from
which
this
angelic
figure
the
only
one
worthy
of
your
attention
firstly
by
reason
of
her
own
worth
and
then
from
her
influence
on
myself
was
entirely
absent
i
will
only
state
that
from
the
humble
position
which
i
gladly
accepted
in
the
beginning
in
washington
s
army
i
rose
regularly
but
rapidly
to
the
rank
of
officer
my
military
education
did
not
take
long
into
this
as
into
everything
that
i
have
undertaken
during
my
life
i
put
my
whole
soul
and
through
the
pertinacity
of
my
will
i
overcame
all
obstacles
i
won
the
confidence
of
my
illustrious
chiefs
my
excellent
constitution
fitted
me
well
for
the
hardships
of
war
my
old
brigand
habits
too
were
of
immense
service
to
me
i
endured
reverses
with
a
calmness
beyond
the
reach
of
most
of
the
young
frenchmen
who
had
embarked
with
me
however
brilliant
their
courage
might
otherwise
have
been
my
own
was
cool
and
tenacious
to
the
great
surprise
of
our
allies
who
more
than
once
doubted
my
origin
on
seeing
how
quickly
i
made
myself
at
home
in
the
forests
and
how
often
my
cunning
and
suspiciousness
made
me
a
match
for
the
savages
who
sometimes
harassed
our
manoeuvres
in
the
midst
of
my
labours
and
frequent
changes
of
place
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
cultivate
my
mind
through
my
intimacy
with
a
young
man
of
merit
whom
providence
sent
me
as
a
companion
and
friend
love
of
the
natural
sciences
had
decided
him
to
join
our
expedition
and
he
never
failed
to
show
himself
a
good
soldier
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
political
sympathy
had
played
only
a
secondary
part
in
his
decision
he
had
no
desire
for
promotion
no
aptitude
for
strategic
studies
his
herbarium
and
his
zoological
occupations
engaged
his
thoughts
much
more
than
the
successes
of
the
war
and
the
triumph
of
liberty
he
fought
too
well
when
occasion
arose
to
ever
deserve
the
reproach
of
lukewarmness
but
up
to
the
eve
of
a
fight
and
from
the
morrow
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
he
was
engaged
in
anything
beyond
a
scientific
expedition
into
the
wilds
of
the
new
world
his
trunk
was
always
full
not
of
money
and
valuables
but
of
natural
history
specimens
and
while
we
were
lying
on
the
grass
on
the
alert
for
the
least
noise
which
might
reveal
the
approach
of
the
enemy
he
would
be
absorbed
in
the
analysis
of
some
plant
or
insect
he
was
an
admirable
young
man
as
pure
as
an
angel
as
unselfish
as
a
stoic
as
patient
as
a
savant
and
withal
cheerful
and
affectionate
when
we
were
in
danger
of
being
surprised
he
could
think
and
talk
of
nothing
but
the
precious
pebbles
and
the
invaluable
bits
of
grass
that
he
had
collected
and
classified
and
yet
were
one
of
us
wounded
he
would
nurse
him
with
a
kindness
and
zeal
that
none
could
surpass
one
day
he
noticed
my
gold
box
as
i
was
putting
it
in
my
bosom
and
he
immediately
begged
me
to
let
him
have
it
to
keep
a
few
flies
legs
and
grasshoppers
wings
which
he
would
have
defended
with
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
it
needed
all
the
reverence
i
had
for
the
relics
of
my
love
to
resist
the
demands
of
friendship
all
he
could
obtain
from
me
was
permission
to
hide
away
a
very
pretty
little
plant
in
my
precious
box
this
plant
which
he
declared
he
was
the
first
to
discover
was
allowed
a
home
by
the
side
of
my
ring
and
note
only
on
condition
that
it
should
be
called
edmunda
sylvestris
to
this
he
consented
he
had
given
the
name
of
samuel
adams
to
a
beautiful
wild
he
had
christened
some
industrious
bee
or
other
franklin
and
nothing
pleased
him
more
than
to
associate
some
honoured
name
with
his
ingenious
observations
the
attachment
i
felt
for
him
was
all
the
more
genuine
from
its
being
my
first
friendship
with
a
man
of
my
own
age
the
pleasure
which
i
derived
from
this
intimacy
gave
me
a
new
insight
into
life
and
revealed
capacities
and
needs
of
the
soul
of
which
i
had
hitherto
been
ignorant
as
i
could
never
wholly
break
away
from
that
love
of
chivalry
which
had
been
implanted
in
me
in
early
childhood
it
pleased
me
to
look
upon
him
as
my
brother
in
arms
and
i
expressed
a
wish
that
he
would
give
me
this
special
title
too
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
intimate
friend
he
caught
at
the
idea
with
a
gladness
of
heart
that
showed
me
how
lively
was
the
sympathy
between
us
he
declared
that
i
was
a
born
naturalist
because
i
was
so
fitted
for
a
roving
life
and
rough
expeditions
sometimes
he
would
reproach
me
with
and
scold
me
seriously
for
carelessly
stepping
upon
interesting
plants
but
he
would
assert
that
i
was
endowed
with
a
sense
of
method
and
that
some
day
i
might
invent
not
a
theory
of
nature
but
an
excellent
system
of
classification
his
prophecy
was
never
fulfilled
but
his
encouragement
aroused
a
taste
for
study
in
me
and
prevented
my
mind
from
being
wholly
paralyzed
by
camp
life
to
me
he
was
as
a
messenger
from
heaven
without
him
i
should
perhaps
have
become
if
not
the
hamstringer
of
at
all
events
the
savage
of
varenne
again
his
teachings
revived
in
me
the
consciousness
of
intellectual
life
he
enlarged
my
ideas
and
also
ennobled
my
instincts
for
though
his
marvellous
integrity
and
his
modest
disposition
prevented
him
from
throwing
himself
into
philosophical
discussions
he
had
an
innate
love
of
justice
and
he
judged
all
questions
of
sentiment
and
morality
with
unerring
wisdom
he
acquired
an
ascendency
over
me
which
the
abbe
had
never
been
able
to
acquire
owing
to
the
attitude
of
mutual
distrust
in
which
we
had
been
placed
from
the
beginning
he
revealed
to
me
the
wonders
of
a
large
part
of
the
physical
world
but
what
he
taught
me
of
chiefest
value
was
to
learn
to
know
myself
and
to
ponder
over
my
own
impressions
i
succeeded
in
controlling
my
impulses
up
to
a
certain
point
i
could
never
subdue
my
pride
and
violent
temper
a
man
can
not
change
the
essence
of
his
nature
but
he
can
guide
his
divers
faculties
towards
a
right
path
he
can
almost
succeed
in
turning
his
faults
to
account
and
this
indeed
is
the
great
secret
and
the
great
problem
of
education
the
conversations
with
my
friend
arthur
led
me
into
such
a
train
of
thought
that
from
my
recollections
of
edmee
s
conduct
i
came
to
deduce
logically
the
motives
which
must
have
inspired
it
i
found
her
noble
and
generous
especially
in
those
matters
which
owing
to
my
distorted
vision
and
false
judgment
had
caused
me
most
pain
i
did
not
love
her
the
more
for
this
that
would
have
been
impossible
but
i
succeeded
in
understanding
why
i
loved
her
with
an
unconquerable
love
in
spite
of
all
she
had
made
me
suffer
this
sacred
fire
burned
in
my
soul
without
growing
dim
for
one
instant
during
the
whole
six
years
of
our
separation
in
spite
of
the
rich
vitality
which
pulsed
through
my
veins
in
spite
of
the
promptings
of
an
external
nature
full
of
voluptuousness
in
spite
of
the
bad
examples
and
numerous
opportunities
which
tempted
mortal
weakness
in
the
freedom
of
a
roving
military
life
i
call
god
to
witness
that
i
preserved
my
robe
of
innocence
undefiled
and
that
i
never
felt
the
kiss
of
a
woman
arthur
whose
calmer
organization
was
less
susceptible
to
temptation
and
who
moreover
was
almost
entirely
engrossed
in
intellectual
labour
did
not
always
practise
the
same
austerity
nay
he
frequently
advised
me
not
to
run
the
risk
of
an
exceptional
life
contrary
to
the
demands
of
nature
when
i
confided
to
him
that
a
removed
all
weaknesses
from
my
path
and
made
a
fall
impossible
he
ceased
to
reason
against
what
he
called
my
fanaticism
this
was
a
word
very
much
in
vogue
and
applied
indiscriminately
to
almost
everything
i
observed
indeed
that
he
had
a
more
profound
esteem
for
me
i
may
even
say
a
sort
of
respect
which
did
not
express
itself
in
words
but
which
was
revealed
by
a
thousand
little
signs
of
compliance
and
deference
one
day
when
he
was
speaking
of
the
great
power
exercised
by
gentleness
of
manners
in
alliance
with
a
resolute
will
citing
both
good
and
bad
examples
from
the
history
of
men
especially
the
gentleness
of
the
apostles
and
the
hypocrisy
of
the
priests
of
all
religions
it
came
into
my
mind
to
ask
him
if
with
my
headstrong
nature
and
hasty
temper
i
should
ever
be
able
to
exercise
any
influence
on
my
fellows
when
i
used
this
last
word
i
was
of
course
thinking
only
of
edmee
arthur
replied
that
the
influence
which
i
exercised
would
be
other
than
that
of
studied
gentleness
your
influence
he
said
will
be
due
to
your
natural
goodness
of
heart
warmth
of
soul
ardour
and
perseverance
in
affection
these
are
what
are
needed
in
family
life
and
these
qualities
make
our
defects
loved
even
by
those
who
have
to
suffer
from
them
most
we
should
endeavour
therefore
to
master
ourselves
out
of
love
for
those
who
love
us
but
to
propose
to
one
s
self
a
system
of
moderation
in
the
most
intimate
concerns
of
love
and
friendship
would
in
my
opinion
be
a
childish
task
a
work
of
egotism
which
would
kill
all
affection
in
ourselves
first
and
soon
afterwards
in
the
others
i
was
speaking
of
studied
moderation
only
in
the
exercise
of
authority
over
the
masses
now
should
your
ambition
ever
you
believe
then
i
said
without
listening
to
the
last
part
of
his
speech
that
such
as
i
am
i
might
make
a
woman
happy
and
force
her
to
love
me
in
spite
of
all
my
faults
and
the
harm
they
cause
o
lovelorn
brain
he
exclaimed
how
difficult
it
is
to
distract
your
thoughts
well
if
you
wish
to
know
bernard
i
will
tell
you
what
i
think
of
your
the
person
you
love
so
ardently
loves
you
unless
she
is
incapable
of
love
or
quite
bereft
of
i
assured
him
that
she
was
as
much
above
all
other
women
as
the
lion
is
above
the
squirrel
the
cedar
above
the
hyssop
and
with
the
help
of
metaphors
i
succeeded
in
convincing
him
then
he
persuaded
me
to
tell
him
a
few
details
in
order
as
he
said
that
he
might
judge
of
my
position
with
regard
to
edmee
i
opened
my
heart
without
reserve
and
told
him
my
history
from
beginning
to
end
at
this
time
we
were
on
the
outskirts
of
a
beautiful
forest
in
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
the
park
at
with
its
fine
lordly
oaks
which
had
never
known
the
insult
of
an
axe
came
into
my
thoughts
as
i
gazed
on
these
trees
of
the
wilds
exempt
from
all
human
care
towering
out
above
our
heads
in
their
might
and
primitive
grace
the
glowing
horizon
reminded
me
of
the
evening
visits
to
patience
s
hut
and
edmee
sitting
under
the
golden
and
the
notes
of
the
merry
parrots
brought
back
to
me
the
warbling
of
the
beautiful
exotic
birds
she
used
to
keep
in
her
room
i
wept
as
i
thought
of
the
land
of
my
birth
so
far
away
of
the
broad
ocean
between
us
which
had
swallowed
so
many
pilgrims
in
the
hour
of
their
return
to
their
native
shores
i
also
thought
of
the
prospects
of
fortune
of
the
dangers
of
war
and
for
the
first
time
i
felt
the
fear
of
death
for
arthur
pressing
my
hand
in
his
assured
me
that
i
was
loved
and
that
in
each
act
of
harshness
or
distrust
he
found
but
a
new
proof
of
affection
my
boy
he
said
can
not
you
see
that
if
she
did
not
want
to
marry
you
she
would
have
found
a
hundred
ways
of
ridding
herself
of
your
pretensions
forever
and
if
she
had
not
felt
an
inexhaustible
affection
for
you
would
she
have
taken
so
much
trouble
and
imposed
so
many
sacrifices
upon
herself
to
raise
you
from
the
abject
condition
in
which
she
found
you
and
make
you
worthy
of
her
well
you
are
always
dreaming
of
the
mighty
deeds
of
the
of
old
can
not
you
see
that
you
are
a
noble
knight
condemned
by
your
lady
to
rude
trials
for
having
failed
in
the
laws
of
gallantry
for
having
demanded
in
an
imperious
tone
the
love
which
ought
to
be
sued
for
on
bended
knee
he
then
entered
into
a
detailed
examination
of
my
misdeeds
and
found
that
the
chastisement
was
severe
but
just
afterwards
he
discussed
the
probabilities
of
the
future
and
very
sensibly
advised
me
to
submit
until
she
thought
right
to
pardon
me
but
i
said
is
there
no
shame
in
a
man
ripened
as
i
am
now
by
reflection
and
roughly
tried
by
war
submitting
like
a
child
to
the
caprices
of
a
woman
no
replied
arthur
there
is
no
shame
in
that
and
the
conduct
of
this
woman
is
not
dictated
by
caprice
one
can
win
nothing
but
honour
in
repairing
any
evil
one
has
done
and
how
few
men
are
capable
of
it
it
is
only
just
that
offended
modesty
should
claim
its
rights
and
its
natural
independence
you
have
behaved
like
albion
do
not
be
astonished
that
edmee
behaves
like
philadelphia
she
will
not
yield
except
on
condition
of
a
glorious
peace
and
she
is
he
wished
to
know
how
she
had
treated
me
during
the
two
years
we
had
been
in
america
i
showed
him
the
few
short
letters
i
had
received
from
her
he
was
struck
by
the
good
sense
and
perfect
integrity
which
seemed
manifested
in
their
lofty
tone
and
manly
precision
in
them
edmee
had
made
me
no
promise
nor
had
she
even
encouraged
me
by
holding
out
any
direct
hopes
but
she
had
displayed
a
lively
desire
for
my
return
and
had
spoken
of
the
happiness
we
should
all
enjoy
when
as
we
sat
around
the
fire
i
should
while
away
the
evenings
at
the
chateau
with
accounts
of
my
wonderful
adventures
and
she
had
not
hesitated
to
tell
me
that
together
with
her
father
i
was
the
one
object
of
her
solicitude
in
life
yet
in
spite
of
this
tenderness
a
terrible
suspicion
harassed
me
in
these
short
letters
from
my
cousin
as
in
those
from
her
father
and
in
the
long
florid
and
affectionate
epistles
from
the
abbe
aubert
they
never
gave
me
any
news
of
the
events
which
might
be
and
ought
to
be
taking
place
in
the
family
each
spoke
of
his
or
her
own
self
and
never
mentioned
the
others
or
at
most
they
only
spoke
of
the
chevalier
s
attacks
of
the
gout
it
was
as
though
an
agreement
had
been
made
between
the
three
that
none
should
talk
about
the
occupations
and
state
of
mind
of
the
other
two
shed
light
and
ease
my
mind
on
this
matter
if
you
can
i
said
to
arthur
there
are
moments
when
i
fancy
that
edmee
must
be
married
and
that
they
have
agreed
not
to
inform
me
until
i
return
and
what
is
to
prevent
this
in
fact
is
it
probable
that
she
likes
me
enough
to
live
a
life
of
solitude
out
of
love
for
me
when
this
very
love
in
obedience
to
the
dictation
of
a
cold
reason
and
an
austere
conscience
can
resign
itself
to
seeing
my
absence
indefinitely
prolonged
with
the
war
i
have
duties
to
perform
here
no
doubt
honour
demands
that
i
should
defend
my
flag
until
the
day
of
the
triumph
or
the
irreparable
defeat
of
the
cause
i
serve
but
i
feel
that
edmee
is
dearer
to
me
than
these
empty
honours
and
that
to
see
her
but
one
hour
sooner
i
would
leave
my
name
to
the
ridicule
or
the
curses
of
the
this
last
thought
replied
arthur
with
a
smile
is
suggested
to
you
by
the
violence
of
your
passion
but
you
would
not
act
as
you
say
even
if
the
opportunity
occurred
when
we
are
grappling
with
a
single
one
of
our
faculties
we
fancy
the
others
annihilated
but
let
some
extraneous
shock
arouse
them
and
we
realize
that
our
soul
draws
its
life
from
several
sources
at
the
same
time
you
are
not
insensible
to
fame
bernard
and
if
edmee
invited
you
to
abandon
it
you
would
perceive
that
it
was
dearer
to
you
than
you
thought
you
have
ardent
republican
convictions
and
edmee
herself
was
the
first
to
inspire
you
with
them
what
then
would
you
think
of
her
and
indeed
what
sort
of
woman
would
she
be
if
she
said
to
you
there
is
something
more
important
than
the
religion
i
preached
to
you
and
the
gods
i
revealed
something
more
august
and
more
sacred
and
that
is
my
own
good
pleasure
bernard
your
love
is
full
of
contradictory
desires
inconsistency
moreover
is
the
mark
of
all
human
loves
men
imagine
that
a
woman
can
have
no
separate
existence
of
her
own
and
that
she
must
always
be
wrapped
up
in
them
and
yet
the
only
woman
they
love
deeply
is
she
whose
character
seems
to
raise
her
above
the
weakness
and
indolence
of
her
sex
you
see
how
all
the
settlers
in
this
country
dispose
of
the
beauty
of
their
slaves
but
they
have
no
love
for
them
however
beautiful
they
may
be
and
if
by
chance
they
become
genuinely
attached
to
one
of
them
their
first
care
is
to
set
her
free
until
then
they
do
not
think
that
they
are
dealing
with
a
human
being
a
spirit
of
independence
the
conception
of
virtue
a
love
of
duty
all
these
privileges
of
lofty
souls
are
essential
therefore
in
the
woman
who
is
to
be
one
s
companion
through
life
and
the
more
your
mistress
gives
proof
of
strength
and
patience
the
more
you
cherish
her
in
spite
of
what
you
may
have
to
suffer
you
must
learn
then
to
distinguish
love
from
desire
desire
wishes
to
break
through
the
very
impediments
by
which
it
is
attracted
and
it
dies
amid
the
ruins
of
the
virtue
it
has
vanquished
love
wishes
to
live
and
in
order
to
do
that
it
would
fain
see
the
object
of
its
worship
long
defended
by
that
wall
of
adamant
whose
strength
and
splendour
mean
true
worth
and
true
in
this
way
would
arthur
explain
to
me
the
mysterious
springs
of
my
passion
and
throw
the
light
of
his
wisdom
upon
the
stormy
abyss
of
my
soul
sometimes
he
used
to
add
if
heaven
had
granted
me
the
woman
i
have
now
and
then
dreamed
of
i
think
i
should
have
succeeded
in
making
a
noble
and
generous
passion
of
my
love
but
science
has
asked
for
too
much
of
my
time
i
have
not
had
leisure
to
look
for
my
ideal
and
if
perchance
it
has
crossed
my
path
i
have
not
been
able
either
to
study
it
or
recognise
it
you
have
been
fortunate
bernard
but
then
you
do
not
sound
the
deeps
of
natural
history
one
man
can
not
have
as
to
my
suspicions
about
edmee
s
marriage
he
rejected
them
with
contempt
as
morbid
fancies
to
him
indeed
edmee
s
silence
showed
an
admirable
delicacy
of
feeling
and
conduct
a
vain
person
he
said
would
take
care
to
let
you
know
all
the
sacrifices
she
had
made
on
your
account
and
would
enumerate
the
titles
and
qualities
of
the
suitors
she
had
refused
edmee
however
has
too
noble
a
soul
too
serious
a
mind
to
enter
into
these
futile
details
she
looks
upon
your
covenant
as
inviolable
and
does
not
imitate
those
weak
consciences
which
are
always
talking
of
their
victories
and
making
a
merit
of
doing
that
in
which
true
strength
finds
no
difficulty
she
is
so
faithful
by
nature
that
she
never
imagines
that
any
one
can
suspect
her
of
being
these
talks
poured
healing
balm
on
my
wounds
when
at
last
france
openly
declared
herself
an
ally
of
america
i
received
a
piece
of
news
from
the
abbe
that
entirely
set
my
mind
at
ease
on
one
point
he
wrote
to
me
that
i
should
probably
meet
an
old
friend
again
in
the
new
world
the
count
de
la
marche
had
been
given
command
of
a
regiment
and
was
setting
out
for
the
united
states
and
between
ourselves
added
the
abbe
it
is
quite
time
that
he
made
a
position
for
himself
this
young
man
though
modest
and
steady
has
always
been
weak
enough
to
yield
to
the
prejudices
of
noble
birth
he
has
been
ashamed
of
his
poverty
and
has
tried
to
hide
it
as
one
hides
a
leprosy
the
result
is
that
his
efforts
to
prevent
others
from
seeing
the
progress
of
his
ruin
have
now
ruined
him
completely
society
attributes
the
rupture
between
edmee
and
him
to
these
reverses
of
fortune
and
people
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
was
but
little
in
love
with
her
person
and
very
much
with
her
dowry
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
credit
him
with
contemptible
views
and
i
can
only
think
that
he
is
suffering
those
mortifications
which
arise
from
a
false
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
good
things
of
this
world
if
you
happen
to
meet
him
edmee
wishes
you
to
show
him
some
friendship
and
to
let
him
know
how
great
an
interest
she
has
always
taken
in
him
your
excellent
cousin
s
conduct
in
this
matter
as
in
all
others
has
been
full
of
kindness
and
xv
one
the
eve
of
de
la
marche
s
departure
and
after
the
abbe
s
letter
had
been
sent
a
little
incident
had
happened
in
varenne
which
when
i
heard
of
it
in
america
caused
me
considerable
surprise
and
pleasure
moreover
it
is
linked
in
a
remarkable
manner
with
the
most
important
events
of
my
life
as
you
will
see
later
although
rather
seriously
wounded
in
the
unfortunate
affair
of
savannah
i
was
actively
engaged
in
virginia
under
general
greene
in
collecting
the
remains
of
the
army
commanded
by
gates
whom
i
considered
a
much
greater
hero
than
his
more
fortunate
rival
washington
we
had
just
learnt
of
the
landing
of
de
ternay
s
squadron
and
the
depression
which
had
fallen
on
us
at
this
period
of
reverses
and
distress
was
beginning
to
vanish
before
the
prospect
of
these
as
a
fact
were
less
considerable
than
we
had
expected
i
was
strolling
through
the
woods
with
arthur
a
short
distance
from
the
camp
and
we
were
taking
advantage
of
this
short
respite
to
have
a
talk
about
other
matters
than
cornwallis
and
the
infamous
arnold
long
saddened
by
the
sight
of
the
woes
of
the
american
nation
by
the
fear
of
seeing
injustice
and
cupidity
triumphing
over
the
cause
of
the
people
we
were
seeking
relief
in
a
measure
of
gaiety
when
i
had
an
hour
s
leisure
i
used
to
escape
from
my
stern
toils
to
the
oasis
of
my
own
thoughts
in
the
family
at
at
such
a
time
i
was
wont
to
tell
my
kind
friend
arthur
some
of
the
comic
incidents
of
my
entry
into
life
after
leaving
at
one
time
i
would
give
him
a
description
of
the
costume
in
which
i
first
appeared
at
another
i
would
describe
mademoiselle
leblanc
s
contempt
and
loathing
for
my
person
and
her
recommendation
to
her
friend
never
to
approach
within
arms
length
of
me
as
i
thought
of
these
amusing
individuals
the
face
of
the
solemn
hidalgo
marcasse
somehow
arose
in
my
memory
and
i
began
to
give
a
faithful
and
detailed
picture
of
the
dress
and
bearing
and
conversation
of
this
enigmatic
personage
not
that
marcasse
was
actually
as
comic
as
he
appeared
to
be
in
my
imagination
but
at
twenty
a
man
is
only
a
boy
especially
when
he
is
a
soldier
and
has
just
escaped
great
dangers
and
so
is
filled
with
careless
pride
at
the
conquest
of
his
own
life
arthur
would
laugh
right
heartily
as
he
listened
to
me
declaring
that
he
would
give
his
whole
collection
of
specimens
for
such
a
curious
animal
as
i
had
just
described
the
pleasure
he
derived
from
my
childish
chatter
increased
my
vivacity
and
i
do
not
know
whether
i
should
have
been
able
to
resist
the
temptation
to
exaggerate
my
uncle
s
peculiarities
when
suddenly
at
a
turn
in
our
path
we
found
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
a
tall
man
poorly
dressed
and
terribly
haggard
who
was
walking
towards
us
with
a
serious
pensive
expression
and
carrying
in
his
hand
a
long
naked
sword
the
point
of
which
was
peacefully
lowered
to
the
ground
this
individual
bore
such
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
one
i
had
just
described
to
arthur
struck
by
the
parallel
burst
into
uncontrollable
laughter
and
moving
aside
to
make
way
for
marcasse
s
double
threw
himself
upon
the
grass
in
a
convulsive
fit
of
coughing
for
myself
i
was
far
from
laughing
for
nothing
that
has
a
supernatural
air
about
it
fails
to
produce
a
vivid
impression
even
on
the
man
most
accustomed
to
dangers
with
staring
eyes
and
outstretched
arms
we
drew
near
to
each
other
myself
and
he
not
the
shade
of
marcasse
but
the
venerable
person
himself
in
flesh
and
blood
of
the
hidalgo
petrified
with
astonishment
when
i
saw
what
i
had
taken
for
his
ghost
slowly
carry
his
hand
to
the
corner
of
his
hat
and
raise
it
without
bending
the
fraction
of
an
inch
i
started
back
a
yard
or
two
and
this
movement
which
arthur
thought
was
a
joke
on
my
part
only
increased
his
merriment
the
was
by
no
means
disconcerted
perhaps
in
his
judicial
gravity
he
was
thinking
that
this
was
the
usual
way
to
greet
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
ocean
but
arthur
s
laughter
almost
proved
infectious
when
marcasse
said
to
me
with
incomparable
gravity
monsieur
bernard
i
have
had
the
honour
of
searching
for
you
for
a
long
for
a
long
time
in
truth
my
good
marcasse
i
replied
as
i
shook
my
old
friend
s
hand
with
delight
but
tell
me
by
what
strange
power
i
have
been
lucky
enough
to
draw
you
hither
in
the
old
days
you
passed
for
a
sorcerer
is
it
possible
that
i
have
become
one
too
without
knowing
it
i
will
explain
all
that
my
dear
general
answered
marcasse
who
was
apparently
dazzled
by
my
captain
s
uniform
if
you
will
allow
me
to
accompany
you
i
will
tell
you
many
things
many
things
on
hearing
marcasse
repeat
his
words
in
a
low
voice
as
if
furnishing
an
echo
for
himself
a
habit
which
only
a
minute
before
i
was
in
the
act
of
imitating
arthur
burst
out
laughing
again
marcasse
turned
toward
him
and
after
surveying
him
intently
bowed
with
imperturbable
gravity
arthur
suddenly
recovering
his
serious
mood
rose
and
with
comic
dignity
bowed
in
return
almost
to
the
ground
we
returned
to
the
camp
together
on
the
way
marcasse
told
me
his
story
in
that
brief
style
of
his
which
as
it
forced
his
hearer
to
ask
a
thousand
wearisome
questions
far
from
simplifying
his
narrative
made
it
extraordinarily
complicated
it
afforded
arthur
great
amusement
but
as
you
would
not
derive
the
same
pleasure
from
listening
to
an
exact
reproduction
of
this
interminable
dialogue
i
will
limit
myself
to
telling
you
how
marcasse
had
come
to
leave
his
country
and
his
friends
in
order
to
give
the
american
cause
the
help
of
his
sword
de
la
marche
happened
to
be
setting
out
for
america
at
the
very
time
when
marcasse
came
to
his
castle
in
berry
for
a
week
to
make
his
annual
round
among
the
beams
and
joists
in
the
barns
the
inmates
of
the
chateau
in
their
excitement
at
the
count
s
departure
indulged
in
wonderful
commentaries
on
that
far
country
so
full
of
dangers
and
marvels
from
which
according
to
the
village
wiseacres
no
man
ever
returned
without
a
vast
fortune
and
so
many
gold
and
silver
ingots
that
he
needed
ten
ships
to
carry
them
all
now
under
his
icy
exterior
don
marcasse
like
some
hyperborean
volcano
concealed
a
glowing
imagination
a
passionate
love
of
the
marvellous
accustomed
to
live
in
a
state
of
equilibrium
on
narrow
beams
in
evidently
loftier
regions
than
other
men
and
not
insensible
to
the
glory
of
astounding
the
bystanders
every
day
by
the
calm
daring
of
his
acrobatic
movements
he
let
himself
be
fired
by
these
pictures
of
eldorado
and
his
dreams
were
the
more
extravagant
because
as
usual
he
unbosomed
himself
to
no
one
de
la
marche
therefore
was
very
much
surprised
when
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
marcasse
presented
himself
and
proposed
to
accompany
him
to
america
as
his
valet
in
vain
did
de
la
marche
remind
him
that
he
was
very
old
to
abandon
his
calling
and
run
the
risks
of
a
new
kind
of
life
marcasse
displayed
so
much
firmness
that
in
the
end
he
gained
his
point
various
reasons
led
de
la
marche
to
consent
to
the
strange
request
he
had
resolved
to
take
with
him
a
servant
older
still
than
the
a
man
who
was
accompanying
him
only
with
great
reluctance
but
this
man
enjoyed
his
entire
confidence
a
favour
which
de
la
marche
was
very
slow
to
grant
since
he
was
only
able
to
keep
up
the
outward
show
of
a
man
of
quality
and
wished
to
be
served
faithfully
and
with
economy
and
prudence
he
knew
however
that
marcasse
was
scrupulously
honest
and
even
singularly
unselfish
for
there
was
something
of
don
quixote
in
the
man
s
soul
as
well
as
in
his
appearance
he
had
found
in
some
ruins
a
sort
of
that
is
to
say
an
earthenware
jar
containing
a
sum
of
about
ten
thousand
francs
in
old
gold
and
silver
coins
and
not
only
had
he
handed
it
over
to
the
owner
of
the
ruins
whom
he
might
easily
have
deceived
but
further
he
had
refused
to
accept
any
reward
declaring
emphatically
in
his
abbreviated
jargon
honesty
would
die
selling
marcasse
s
economy
his
discretion
his
punctuality
seemed
likely
to
make
him
a
valuable
man
if
he
could
be
trained
to
put
these
qualities
at
the
service
of
others
the
one
thing
to
be
feared
was
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
accustom
himself
to
his
loss
of
independence
however
de
la
marche
thought
that
before
de
ternay
s
squadron
sailed
he
would
have
time
to
test
his
new
squire
sufficiently
on
his
side
marcasse
felt
many
regrets
at
taking
leave
of
his
friends
and
home
for
if
he
had
friends
everywhere
and
everywhere
a
native
place
as
he
said
in
allusion
to
his
wandering
life
he
still
had
a
very
marked
preference
for
varenne
and
of
all
his
castles
for
he
was
accustomed
to
call
every
place
he
stopped
at
his
the
chateau
of
was
the
only
one
which
he
arrived
at
with
pleasure
and
left
with
regret
one
day
when
he
had
missed
his
footing
on
the
roof
and
had
rather
a
serious
fall
edmee
then
still
a
child
had
won
his
heart
by
the
tears
she
had
shed
over
this
accident
and
the
artless
attentions
she
had
shown
him
and
ever
since
patience
had
come
to
dwell
on
the
edge
of
the
park
marcasse
had
felt
still
more
attracted
toward
for
in
patience
marcasse
had
found
his
orestes
marcasse
did
not
always
understand
patience
but
patience
was
the
only
man
who
thoroughly
understood
marcasse
and
who
knew
how
much
chivalrous
honesty
and
noble
courage
lay
hidden
beneath
that
odd
exterior
humbly
bowing
to
the
hermit
s
intellectual
superiority
the
would
stop
respectfully
whenever
the
poetic
frenzy
took
possession
of
patience
and
made
his
words
unintelligible
at
such
a
time
marcasse
would
refrain
from
questions
and
remarks
with
touching
gentleness
would
lower
his
eyes
and
nodding
his
head
from
time
to
time
as
if
he
understood
and
approved
would
at
least
afford
his
friend
the
innocent
pleasure
of
being
listened
to
without
contradiction
marcasse
however
had
understood
enough
to
make
him
embrace
republican
ideas
and
share
in
those
romantic
hopes
of
universal
levelling
and
a
return
to
the
golden
age
which
had
been
so
ardently
fostered
by
old
patience
having
frequently
heard
his
friend
say
that
these
doctrines
were
to
be
cultivated
with
prudence
a
precept
however
to
which
patience
gave
but
little
heed
himself
the
hidalgo
inclined
to
reticence
both
by
habit
and
inclination
never
spoke
of
his
philosophy
but
he
proved
himself
a
more
efficacious
propagandist
by
carrying
about
from
castle
to
cottage
and
from
house
to
farm
those
little
cheap
editions
of
science
du
bonhomme
and
other
small
treatises
on
popular
patriotism
which
according
to
the
jesuits
a
secret
society
of
voltairian
philosophers
devoted
to
the
diabolical
practice
of
freemasonry
circulated
gratis
among
the
lower
classes
thus
in
marcasse
s
sudden
resolution
there
was
as
much
revolutionary
enthusiasm
as
love
of
adventure
for
a
long
time
the
dormouse
and
polecat
had
seemed
to
him
overfeeble
enemies
for
his
restless
valour
even
as
the
granary
floor
seemed
to
afford
too
narrow
a
field
every
day
he
read
the
papers
of
the
previous
day
in
the
servants
hall
of
the
houses
he
visited
and
it
appeared
to
him
that
this
war
in
america
which
was
hailed
as
the
awakening
of
the
spirit
of
justice
and
liberty
in
the
new
world
ought
to
produce
a
revolution
in
france
it
is
true
he
had
a
very
literal
notion
of
the
way
in
which
ideas
were
to
cross
the
seas
and
take
possession
of
the
minds
of
our
continent
in
his
dreams
he
used
to
see
an
army
of
victorious
americans
disembarking
from
numberless
ships
and
bringing
the
olive
branch
of
peace
and
the
horn
of
plenty
to
the
french
nation
in
these
same
dreams
he
beheld
himself
at
the
head
of
a
legion
of
heroes
returning
to
varenne
as
a
warrior
a
legislator
a
rival
of
washington
suppressing
abuses
cutting
down
enormous
fortunes
assigning
to
each
proletarian
a
suitable
share
and
in
the
midst
of
his
and
vigorous
measures
protecting
the
good
and
nobles
and
assuring
an
honourable
existence
to
them
needless
to
say
the
distress
inseparable
from
all
great
political
crises
never
entered
into
marcasse
s
mind
and
not
a
single
drop
of
blood
sullied
the
romantic
picture
which
patience
had
unrolled
before
his
eyes
from
these
sublime
hopes
to
the
role
of
valet
to
de
la
marche
was
a
far
cry
but
marcasse
could
reach
his
goal
by
no
other
way
the
ranks
of
the
army
corps
destined
for
america
had
long
been
filled
and
it
was
only
in
the
character
of
a
passenger
attached
to
the
expedition
that
he
could
take
his
place
on
one
of
the
merchant
ships
that
followed
the
expedition
he
had
questioned
the
abbe
on
these
points
without
revealing
his
plans
his
departure
quite
staggered
all
the
inhabitants
of
varenne
no
sooner
had
he
set
foot
on
the
shores
of
the
states
than
he
felt
an
irresistible
inclination
to
take
his
big
hat
and
his
big
sword
and
go
off
all
alone
through
the
woods
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
in
his
own
country
his
conscience
however
prevented
him
from
quitting
his
master
after
having
pledged
himself
to
serve
him
he
had
calculated
that
fortune
would
help
him
and
fortune
did
the
war
proved
much
more
bloody
and
vigorous
than
had
been
expected
and
de
la
marche
feared
though
wrongly
that
he
might
be
impeded
by
the
poor
health
of
his
gaunt
squire
having
a
suspicion
too
of
the
man
s
desire
for
liberty
he
offered
him
a
sum
of
money
and
some
letters
of
recommendation
to
enable
him
to
join
the
american
troops
as
a
volunteer
marcasse
knowing
the
state
of
his
master
s
fortune
refused
the
money
and
only
accepted
the
letters
and
then
set
off
with
as
light
a
step
as
the
nimblest
weasels
that
he
had
ever
killed
his
intention
was
to
make
for
philadelphia
but
through
a
chance
occurrence
which
i
need
not
relate
he
learnt
that
i
was
in
the
south
and
rightly
calculating
that
he
would
obtain
both
advice
and
help
from
me
he
had
set
out
to
find
me
alone
on
foot
through
unknown
countries
almost
uninhabited
and
often
full
of
danger
of
all
kinds
his
clothes
alone
had
suffered
his
yellow
face
had
not
changed
its
tint
and
he
was
no
more
surprised
at
his
latest
exploit
than
if
he
had
merely
covered
the
distance
from
to
gazeau
tower
the
only
fresh
habit
that
i
noticed
in
him
was
that
he
would
turn
round
from
time
to
time
and
look
behind
him
as
if
he
had
felt
inclined
to
call
some
one
then
immediately
after
he
would
smile
and
sigh
almost
at
the
same
instant
i
could
not
resist
a
desire
to
ask
him
the
cause
of
his
uneasiness
alas
he
replied
habit
can
t
get
rid
of
a
poor
dog
good
dog
always
saying
here
blaireau
blaireau
here
i
understand
i
said
blaireau
is
dead
and
you
can
not
accustom
yourself
to
the
idea
that
you
will
never
see
him
at
your
heels
dead
he
exclaimed
with
an
expression
of
horror
no
thank
god
friend
patience
great
friend
blaireau
quite
well
off
but
sad
like
his
master
his
master
alone
if
blaireau
is
with
patience
said
arthur
he
is
well
off
as
you
say
for
patience
wants
nothing
patience
will
love
him
because
he
loves
his
master
and
you
are
certain
to
see
your
good
friend
and
faithful
dog
marcasse
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
individual
who
seemed
to
be
so
well
acquainted
with
his
life
but
feeling
sure
that
he
had
never
seen
him
before
he
acted
as
he
was
wont
to
do
when
he
did
not
understand
he
raised
his
hat
and
bowed
respectfully
on
my
immediate
recommendation
marcasse
was
enrolled
in
my
company
and
a
little
while
afterward
was
made
a
sergeant
the
worthy
man
went
through
the
whole
campaign
with
me
and
went
through
it
bravely
and
in
when
i
rejoined
rochambeau
s
army
to
fight
under
the
french
flag
he
followed
me
as
he
was
anxious
to
share
my
lot
until
the
end
in
the
early
days
i
looked
upon
him
rather
as
an
amusement
than
a
companion
but
his
excellent
conduct
and
calm
fearlessness
soon
won
for
him
the
esteem
of
all
and
i
had
reason
to
be
proud
of
my
arthur
also
conceived
a
great
friendship
for
him
and
when
off
duty
he
accompanied
us
in
all
our
walks
carrying
the
naturalist
s
box
and
running
the
snakes
through
with
his
sword
but
when
i
tried
to
make
him
speak
of
my
cousin
he
by
no
means
satisfied
me
whether
he
did
not
understand
how
eager
i
felt
to
learn
all
the
details
of
the
life
she
was
leading
far
away
from
me
or
whether
in
this
matter
he
was
obeying
one
of
those
inviolable
laws
which
governed
his
conscience
i
could
never
obtain
from
him
any
clear
solution
of
the
doubts
which
harassed
me
quite
early
he
told
me
that
there
was
no
question
of
her
marriage
with
any
one
but
accustomed
though
i
was
to
his
vague
manner
of
expressing
himself
i
imagined
he
seemed
embarrassed
in
making
this
assertion
and
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
sworn
to
keep
a
secret
honour
forbade
me
to
insist
to
such
an
extent
as
to
let
him
see
my
hopes
and
so
there
always
remained
between
us
a
painful
point
which
i
tried
to
avoid
touching
upon
but
to
which
in
spite
of
myself
i
was
continually
returning
as
long
as
arthur
was
near
me
i
retained
my
reason
and
interpreted
edmee
s
letters
in
the
most
loyal
way
but
when
i
was
unfortunate
enough
to
be
separated
from
him
my
sufferings
revived
and
my
stay
in
america
became
more
irksome
to
me
every
day
our
separation
took
place
when
i
left
the
american
army
to
fight
under
the
command
of
the
french
general
arthur
was
an
american
and
moreover
he
was
only
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
war
to
retire
from
the
service
and
settle
in
boston
with
cooper
who
loved
him
as
his
son
and
who
had
undertaken
to
get
him
appointed
principal
librarian
to
the
library
of
the
philadelphia
society
this
was
all
the
reward
arthur
desired
for
his
labours
the
events
which
filled
my
last
years
in
america
belong
to
history
it
was
with
a
truly
personal
delight
that
i
hailed
the
peace
which
proclaimed
the
united
states
a
free
nation
i
had
begun
to
chafe
at
my
long
absence
from
france
my
passion
had
been
growing
ever
greater
and
left
no
room
for
the
intoxication
of
military
glory
before
my
departure
i
went
to
take
leave
of
arthur
then
i
sailed
with
the
worthy
marcasse
divided
between
sorrow
at
parting
from
my
only
friend
and
joy
at
the
prospect
of
once
more
seeing
my
only
love
the
squadron
to
which
my
ship
belonged
experienced
many
vicissitudes
during
the
passage
and
several
times
i
gave
up
all
hope
of
ever
kneeling
before
edmee
under
the
great
oaks
of
at
last
after
a
final
storm
off
the
coast
of
france
i
set
foot
on
the
shores
of
brittany
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
my
poor
sergeant
who
had
borne
our
common
misfortunes
if
not
with
greater
physical
courage
at
least
with
a
calmer
spirit
and
we
mingled
our
tears
xvi
we
set
out
from
brest
without
sending
any
letter
to
announce
our
coming
when
we
arrived
near
varenne
we
alighted
from
the
and
ordering
the
driver
to
proceed
by
the
longest
road
to
took
a
short
cut
through
the
woods
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
trees
in
the
park
raising
their
venerable
heads
above
the
copses
like
a
solemn
phalanx
of
druids
in
the
middle
of
a
prostrate
multitude
my
heart
began
to
beat
so
violently
that
i
was
forced
to
stop
well
said
marcasse
turning
round
with
an
almost
stern
expression
as
if
he
would
have
reproached
me
for
my
weakness
but
a
moment
later
i
saw
that
his
own
face
too
was
betraying
unexpected
emotion
a
plaintive
whining
and
a
bushy
tail
brushing
against
his
legs
had
made
him
start
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
on
seeing
blaireau
the
poor
animal
had
scented
his
master
from
afar
and
had
rushed
forward
with
all
the
speed
of
his
first
youth
to
roll
at
his
feet
for
a
moment
we
thought
he
was
going
to
die
there
for
he
remained
motionless
and
convulsed
as
it
were
under
marcasse
s
caressing
hand
then
suddenly
he
sprang
up
as
if
struck
with
an
idea
worthy
of
a
man
and
set
off
with
the
speed
of
lightning
in
the
direction
of
patience
s
hut
yes
go
and
tell
my
friend
good
dog
exclaimed
marcasse
a
better
friend
than
you
would
be
more
than
he
turned
towards
me
and
i
saw
two
big
tears
trickling
down
the
cheeks
of
the
impassive
hidalgo
we
hastened
our
steps
till
we
reached
the
hut
it
had
undergone
striking
improvements
a
pretty
rustic
garden
inclosed
by
a
quickset
hedge
with
a
bank
of
stones
behind
extended
round
the
little
house
the
approach
to
this
was
no
longer
a
rough
little
path
but
a
handsome
walk
on
either
side
of
which
splendid
vegetables
stretched
out
in
regular
rows
like
an
army
in
marching
order
the
van
was
composed
of
a
battalion
of
cabbages
carrots
and
lettuces
formed
the
main
body
and
along
the
hedge
some
modest
sorrel
brought
up
the
rear
beautiful
already
well
grown
spread
their
verdant
shade
above
these
plants
while
alternately
standards
and
espaliers
with
borders
of
thyme
and
sage
kissing
the
feet
of
sunflowers
and
gilliflowers
convicted
patience
of
a
strange
return
to
ideas
of
social
order
and
even
to
a
taste
for
luxuries
the
change
was
so
remarkable
that
i
thought
i
should
no
longer
find
patience
in
the
cottage
a
strange
feeling
of
uneasiness
began
to
come
over
me
my
fear
almost
turned
into
certainty
when
i
saw
two
young
men
from
the
village
occupied
in
trimming
the
espaliers
our
passage
had
lasted
more
than
four
months
and
it
must
have
been
quite
six
months
since
we
had
had
any
news
of
the
hermit
marcasse
however
seemed
to
feel
no
fear
blaireau
had
told
him
plainly
that
patience
was
alive
and
the
footmarks
of
the
little
dog
freshly
printed
in
the
sand
of
the
walk
showed
the
direction
in
which
he
had
gone
notwithstanding
i
was
so
afraid
of
seeing
a
cloud
come
over
the
joy
of
this
day
that
i
did
not
dare
to
question
the
gardeners
about
patience
silently
i
followed
the
hidalgo
whose
eyes
grew
full
of
tears
as
they
gazed
upon
this
new
eden
and
whose
prudent
mouth
let
no
sound
escape
save
the
word
change
which
he
repeated
several
times
at
last
i
grew
impatient
the
walk
seemed
interminable
though
very
short
in
reality
and
i
began
to
run
my
heart
beating
wildly
perhaps
edmee
i
said
to
myself
is
here
however
she
was
not
there
and
i
could
only
hear
the
voice
of
the
hermit
saying
now
then
what
is
the
matter
has
the
poor
dog
gone
mad
down
blaireau
you
would
never
have
worried
your
master
in
this
way
this
is
what
comes
of
being
too
kind
blaireau
is
not
mad
i
exclaimed
as
i
entered
have
you
grown
deaf
to
the
approach
of
a
friend
master
patience
patience
who
was
in
the
act
of
counting
a
pile
of
money
let
it
fall
on
the
table
and
came
towards
me
with
the
old
cordiality
i
embraced
him
heartily
he
was
surprised
and
touched
at
my
joy
then
he
examined
me
from
head
to
foot
and
seemed
to
be
wondering
at
the
change
in
my
appearance
when
marcasse
arrived
at
the
door
then
a
sublime
expression
came
over
patience
s
face
and
lifting
his
strong
arms
to
heaven
he
exclaimed
the
words
of
the
canticle
now
let
me
depart
in
peace
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
him
i
yearned
the
hidalgo
said
nothing
he
raised
his
hat
as
usual
then
sitting
down
he
turned
pale
and
shut
his
eyes
his
dog
jumped
up
on
his
knees
and
displayed
his
affection
by
attempts
at
little
cries
which
changed
into
a
series
of
sneezes
you
remember
that
he
was
born
dumb
trembling
with
old
age
and
delight
he
stretched
out
his
pointed
nose
towards
the
long
nose
of
his
master
but
his
master
did
not
respond
with
the
customary
down
blaireau
marcasse
had
fainted
this
loving
soul
no
more
able
than
blaireau
to
express
itself
in
words
had
sunk
beneath
the
weight
of
his
own
happiness
patience
ran
and
fetched
him
a
large
mug
of
wine
of
the
district
in
its
second
year
that
is
to
say
the
oldest
and
best
possible
he
made
him
swallow
a
few
drops
its
strength
revived
him
the
hidalgo
excused
his
weakness
on
the
score
of
fatigue
and
the
heat
he
would
not
or
could
not
assign
it
to
its
real
sense
there
are
souls
who
die
out
after
burning
with
unsurpassable
moral
beauty
and
grandeur
without
ever
having
found
a
way
and
even
without
ever
having
felt
the
need
of
revealing
themselves
to
others
when
patience
who
was
as
demonstrative
as
his
friend
was
the
contrary
had
recovered
from
his
first
transports
he
turned
to
me
and
said
now
my
young
officer
i
see
that
you
have
no
wish
to
remain
here
long
let
us
make
haste
then
to
the
place
you
are
burning
to
reach
there
is
some
one
who
will
be
much
surprised
and
much
delighted
you
may
take
my
we
entered
the
park
and
while
crossing
it
patience
explained
the
change
which
had
come
over
his
habitation
and
his
life
for
myself
he
said
to
me
you
see
that
i
have
not
changed
the
same
appearance
the
same
ways
and
if
i
offered
you
some
wine
just
now
that
does
not
prevent
me
from
drinking
water
myself
but
i
have
money
and
land
and
workmen
yes
i
have
well
all
this
is
in
spite
of
myself
as
you
will
see
some
three
years
ago
mademoiselle
edmee
spoke
of
the
difficulty
she
had
in
bestowing
alms
so
as
to
do
real
good
the
abbe
was
as
unskilful
as
herself
people
would
impose
on
them
every
day
and
use
their
money
for
bad
ends
whereas
proud
and
might
be
in
a
state
of
real
distress
without
any
one
being
able
to
discover
the
fact
she
was
afraid
that
if
she
inquired
into
their
wants
they
might
take
it
as
an
insult
and
when
worthless
fellows
appealed
to
her
she
preferred
being
their
dupe
to
erring
against
charity
in
this
manner
she
used
to
give
away
a
great
deal
of
money
and
do
very
little
good
i
then
made
her
understand
how
money
was
the
thing
that
was
the
least
necessary
to
the
necessitous
i
explained
that
men
were
really
unfortunate
not
when
they
were
unable
to
dress
better
than
their
fellows
or
go
to
the
tavern
on
sundays
or
display
at
a
spotlessly
white
stocking
with
a
red
garter
above
the
knee
or
talk
about
my
mare
my
cow
my
vine
my
barn
but
rather
when
they
were
afflicted
with
poor
health
and
a
bad
season
when
they
could
not
protect
themselves
against
the
cold
and
heat
and
sickness
against
the
pangs
of
hunger
and
thirst
i
told
her
then
not
to
judge
of
the
strength
and
health
of
peasants
by
myself
but
to
go
in
person
and
inquire
into
their
illnesses
and
their
wants
these
folk
are
not
philosophers
i
said
they
have
their
little
vanities
they
are
fond
of
finery
spend
the
little
they
earn
on
cutting
a
figure
and
have
not
foresight
enough
to
deprive
themselves
of
a
passing
pleasure
in
order
to
lay
by
something
against
a
day
of
real
need
in
short
they
do
not
know
how
to
use
their
money
they
tell
you
they
are
in
debt
and
though
that
may
be
true
it
is
not
true
that
they
will
use
the
money
you
give
them
to
pay
what
they
owe
they
take
no
thought
of
the
morrow
they
will
agree
to
as
high
a
rate
of
interest
as
may
be
asked
and
with
your
money
they
will
buy
a
or
a
set
of
furniture
so
as
to
astonish
their
neighbours
and
make
them
jealous
meanwhile
their
debts
go
on
increasing
year
by
year
and
in
the
end
they
have
to
sell
their
and
their
furniture
because
the
creditor
who
is
always
one
of
themselves
calls
for
repayment
or
for
more
interest
than
they
can
furnish
everything
goes
the
principal
takes
all
their
capital
just
as
the
interest
has
taken
all
their
income
then
you
grow
old
and
can
work
no
longer
your
children
abandon
you
because
you
have
brought
them
up
badly
and
because
they
have
the
same
passions
and
the
same
vanities
as
yourself
all
you
can
do
is
to
take
a
wallet
and
go
from
door
to
door
to
beg
your
bread
because
you
are
used
to
bread
and
would
die
if
you
had
to
live
on
roots
like
the
sorcerer
patience
that
outcast
of
nature
whom
everybody
hates
and
despises
because
he
has
not
become
a
beggar
the
beggar
moreover
is
hardly
worse
off
than
the
probably
he
is
better
off
he
is
no
longer
troubled
with
pride
whether
estimable
or
foolish
he
has
no
longer
to
suffer
the
folks
in
his
part
of
the
country
are
good
to
him
there
is
not
a
beggar
that
wants
for
a
bed
or
supper
as
he
goes
his
round
the
peasants
load
him
with
bits
of
bread
to
such
an
extent
that
he
has
enough
to
feed
both
poultry
and
pigs
in
the
little
hovel
where
he
has
left
a
child
and
an
old
mother
to
look
after
his
animals
every
week
he
returns
there
and
spends
two
or
three
days
doing
nothing
except
counting
the
pennies
that
have
been
given
him
these
poor
coins
often
serve
to
satisfy
the
superfluous
wants
which
idleness
breeds
a
peasant
rarely
takes
snuff
many
beggars
can
not
do
without
it
they
ask
for
it
more
eagerly
than
for
bread
so
the
beggar
is
no
more
to
be
pitied
than
the
labourer
but
he
is
corrupt
and
debauched
when
he
is
not
a
scoundrel
and
a
brute
which
in
truth
is
seldom
enough
this
then
is
what
ought
to
be
done
i
said
to
edmee
and
the
abbe
tells
me
that
this
is
also
the
idea
of
your
philosophers
you
who
are
always
ready
to
help
the
unfortunate
should
give
without
consulting
the
special
fancies
of
the
man
who
asks
but
only
after
ascertaining
his
real
edmee
objected
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
obtain
the
necessary
information
that
she
would
have
to
give
her
whole
time
to
it
and
neglect
the
chevalier
who
is
growing
old
and
can
no
longer
read
anything
without
his
daughter
s
eyes
and
head
the
abbe
was
too
fond
of
improving
his
mind
from
the
writings
of
the
wise
to
have
time
for
anything
else
that
is
what
comes
of
all
this
study
of
virtue
i
said
to
her
it
makes
a
man
forget
to
be
you
are
quite
right
answered
edmee
but
what
is
to
be
done
i
promised
to
think
it
over
and
this
is
how
i
went
to
work
instead
of
taking
my
walks
as
usual
in
the
direction
of
the
woods
i
paid
a
visit
every
day
to
the
small
holdings
it
cost
me
a
great
effort
i
like
to
be
alone
and
everywhere
i
had
shunned
my
for
so
many
years
that
i
had
lost
touch
with
them
however
this
was
a
duty
and
i
did
it
i
went
to
various
houses
and
by
way
of
conversation
first
of
all
over
hedges
and
then
inside
the
houses
themselves
i
made
inquiries
as
to
those
points
which
i
wanted
to
learn
at
first
they
gave
me
a
welcome
such
as
they
would
give
to
a
lost
dog
in
time
of
drought
and
with
a
vexation
i
could
scarce
conceal
i
noticed
the
hatred
and
distrust
on
all
their
faces
though
i
had
not
cared
to
live
among
other
men
i
still
had
an
affection
for
them
i
knew
that
they
were
unfortunate
rather
than
vicious
i
had
spent
all
my
time
in
lamenting
their
woes
and
railing
against
those
that
caused
them
and
when
for
the
first
time
i
saw
a
possibility
of
doing
something
for
some
of
them
these
very
men
shut
their
doors
the
very
moment
they
caught
sight
of
me
in
the
distance
and
their
children
those
pretty
children
that
i
love
so
much
would
hide
themselves
in
ditches
so
as
to
escape
the
fever
which
it
was
said
i
could
give
with
a
glance
however
as
edmee
s
friendship
for
me
was
well
known
they
did
not
dare
to
repulse
me
openly
and
i
succeeded
in
getting
the
information
we
wanted
whenever
i
told
her
of
any
distress
she
at
once
supplied
a
remedy
one
house
was
full
of
cracks
and
while
the
daughter
was
wearing
an
apron
of
at
four
francs
an
ell
the
rain
was
falling
on
the
grandmother
s
bed
and
the
little
children
s
cradles
the
roof
and
walls
were
repaired
we
supplied
the
materials
and
paid
the
workmen
but
no
more
money
for
gaudy
aprons
in
another
case
an
old
woman
had
been
reduced
to
beggary
because
she
had
listened
too
well
to
her
heart
and
given
all
she
had
to
her
children
who
had
turned
her
out
of
doors
or
made
her
life
so
unbearable
that
she
preferred
to
be
a
tramp
we
took
up
the
old
woman
s
cause
and
threatened
that
we
would
bring
the
matter
before
the
courts
at
our
own
expense
thus
we
obtained
for
her
a
pension
to
which
we
added
when
it
was
not
sufficient
we
induced
several
old
persons
who
were
in
a
similar
position
to
combine
and
live
together
under
the
same
roof
we
chose
one
as
head
and
gave
him
a
little
capital
and
as
he
was
an
industrious
and
methodical
man
he
turned
it
to
such
profit
that
his
children
came
and
made
their
peace
with
him
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
help
in
his
establishment
we
did
many
other
things
besides
i
need
not
give
you
details
as
you
will
see
them
yourself
i
say
we
because
though
i
did
not
wish
to
be
concerned
in
anything
beyond
what
i
had
already
done
i
was
gradually
drawn
on
and
obliged
to
do
more
and
more
to
concern
myself
with
many
things
and
finally
with
everything
in
short
it
is
i
who
make
the
investigations
superintend
the
works
and
conduct
all
negotiations
mademoiselle
edmee
wished
me
to
keep
a
sum
of
money
by
me
so
that
i
might
dispose
of
it
without
consulting
her
first
this
i
have
never
allowed
myself
to
do
and
moreover
she
has
never
once
opposed
any
of
my
ideas
but
all
this
you
know
has
meant
much
work
and
many
worries
ever
since
the
people
realized
that
i
was
a
little
turgot
they
have
grovelled
before
me
and
that
has
pained
me
not
a
little
and
so
i
have
various
friends
that
i
don
t
care
for
and
various
enemies
that
i
could
well
do
without
the
sham
poor
owe
me
a
grudge
because
i
do
not
let
myself
be
duped
by
them
and
there
are
perverse
and
worthless
people
who
think
one
is
always
doing
too
much
for
others
and
never
enough
for
them
with
all
this
bustle
and
all
these
bickerings
i
can
no
longer
take
my
walk
during
the
night
and
my
sleep
during
the
day
i
am
now
monsieur
patience
and
no
longer
the
sorcerer
of
gazeau
tower
but
alas
i
am
a
hermit
no
more
and
believe
me
i
would
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
could
have
been
born
selfish
so
that
i
might
throw
off
my
harness
and
return
to
my
savage
life
and
my
when
patience
had
given
us
this
account
of
his
work
we
complimented
him
on
it
but
we
ventured
to
express
a
doubt
about
his
pretended
this
magnificent
garden
seemed
to
indicate
a
compromise
with
those
superfluous
necessities
the
use
of
which
by
others
he
had
always
deplored
that
he
said
waving
his
arm
in
the
direction
of
his
inclosure
that
does
not
concern
me
they
made
it
against
my
wishes
but
as
they
were
worthy
folk
and
my
refusal
would
have
grieved
them
i
was
obliged
to
allow
it
you
must
know
that
if
i
have
stirred
ingratitude
in
many
hearts
i
have
also
made
a
few
happy
ones
grateful
so
two
or
three
families
to
whom
i
had
done
some
service
tried
all
possible
means
to
give
me
pleasure
in
return
and
as
i
refused
everything
they
thought
they
would
give
me
a
surprise
once
i
had
to
pay
a
visit
to
berthenoux
for
several
days
on
some
confidential
business
which
had
been
entrusted
to
me
for
people
have
come
to
imagine
me
a
very
clever
man
so
easy
is
it
to
pass
from
one
extreme
to
another
on
my
return
i
found
this
garden
marked
out
planted
and
inclosed
as
you
see
it
in
vain
did
i
get
angry
and
explain
that
i
did
not
want
to
work
that
i
was
too
old
and
that
the
pleasure
of
eating
a
little
more
fruit
was
not
worth
the
trouble
that
this
garden
was
going
to
cost
me
they
finished
it
without
heeding
what
i
said
and
declared
that
i
need
not
trouble
in
the
least
because
they
would
undertake
to
cultivate
it
for
me
and
indeed
for
the
last
two
years
the
good
folk
have
not
failed
to
come
now
one
and
now
another
and
give
such
time
in
each
season
as
was
necessary
to
keep
it
in
perfect
order
besides
though
i
have
altered
nothing
in
my
own
ways
of
living
the
produce
of
this
garden
has
been
very
useful
during
the
winter
i
was
able
to
feed
several
poor
people
with
my
vegetables
while
my
fruit
has
served
to
win
the
affection
of
the
little
children
who
no
longer
cry
out
wolf
when
they
see
me
but
have
grown
bold
enough
to
come
and
kiss
the
sorcerer
other
people
have
forced
me
to
accept
presents
of
wine
and
now
and
then
of
white
bread
and
cheeses
of
cow
s
milk
all
these
things
however
only
enable
me
to
be
polite
to
the
village
elders
when
they
come
and
report
the
deserving
cases
of
the
place
so
that
i
may
make
them
known
at
the
castle
these
honours
have
not
turned
my
head
as
you
see
nay
more
i
may
say
that
when
i
have
done
about
all
that
i
have
to
do
i
shall
leave
the
cares
of
greatness
behind
me
and
return
to
my
philosopher
s
life
perhaps
to
gazeau
tower
who
knows
we
were
now
at
the
end
of
our
walk
as
i
set
foot
on
the
steps
of
the
chateau
i
was
suddenly
filled
with
a
feeling
of
devoutness
i
clasped
my
hands
and
called
upon
heaven
in
a
sort
of
terror
a
vague
indefinable
fear
arose
in
me
i
imagined
all
manner
of
things
that
might
hinder
my
happiness
i
hesitated
to
cross
the
threshold
of
the
house
then
i
rushed
forward
a
mist
came
over
my
eyes
a
buzzing
filled
my
ears
i
met
who
not
recognising
me
gave
a
loud
cry
and
threw
himself
in
my
path
to
prevent
me
from
entering
without
being
announced
i
pushed
him
aside
and
he
sank
down
astounded
on
one
of
the
hall
chairs
while
i
hastened
to
the
door
of
the
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
throw
it
open
i
was
seized
with
a
new
fear
and
checked
myself
then
i
opened
it
so
timidly
that
edmee
who
was
occupied
at
some
embroidery
on
a
frame
did
not
raise
her
eyes
thinking
that
in
this
slight
noise
she
recognised
the
respectful
the
chevalier
was
asleep
and
did
not
wake
this
old
man
tall
and
thin
like
all
the
mauprats
was
sitting
with
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
and
his
pale
wrinkled
face
which
seemed
already
wrapped
in
the
torpor
of
the
grave
resembled
one
of
those
angular
heads
in
carved
oak
which
adorned
the
back
of
his
big
his
feet
were
stretched
out
in
front
of
a
fire
of
dried
although
the
sun
was
warm
and
a
bright
ray
was
falling
on
his
white
head
and
making
it
shine
like
silver
and
how
could
i
describe
to
you
my
feelings
on
beholding
edmee
she
was
bending
over
her
tapestry
and
glancing
from
time
to
time
at
her
father
to
notice
his
slightest
movements
but
what
patience
and
resignation
were
revealed
in
her
whole
attitude
edmee
was
not
fond
of
needlework
her
mind
was
too
vigorous
to
attach
much
importance
to
the
effect
of
one
shade
by
the
side
of
another
shade
and
to
the
regularity
of
one
stitch
laid
against
another
stitch
besides
the
blood
flowed
swiftly
in
her
veins
and
when
her
mind
was
not
absorbed
in
intellectual
work
she
needed
exercise
in
the
open
air
but
ever
since
her
father
a
prey
to
the
infirmities
of
old
age
had
been
almost
unable
to
leave
his
she
had
refused
to
leave
him
for
a
single
moment
and
since
she
could
not
always
be
reading
and
working
her
mind
she
had
felt
the
necessity
of
taking
up
some
of
those
feminine
occupations
which
as
she
said
are
the
amusements
of
she
had
conquered
her
nature
then
in
truly
heroic
fashion
in
one
of
those
secret
struggles
which
often
take
place
under
our
eyes
without
our
suspecting
the
issue
involved
she
had
done
more
than
subdue
her
nature
she
had
even
changed
the
circulation
of
her
blood
i
found
her
thinner
and
her
complexion
had
lost
that
first
freshness
of
youth
which
like
the
bloom
that
the
breath
of
morning
spreads
over
fruit
disappears
at
the
slightest
shock
from
without
although
it
may
have
been
respected
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
yet
in
this
premature
paleness
and
in
this
somewhat
unhealthy
thinness
there
seemed
to
be
an
indefinable
charm
her
eyes
more
sunken
but
inscrutable
as
ever
showed
less
pride
and
more
melancholy
than
of
old
her
mouth
had
become
more
mobile
and
her
smile
was
more
delicate
and
less
contemptuous
when
she
spoke
to
me
i
seemed
to
behold
two
persons
in
her
the
old
and
the
new
and
i
found
that
so
far
from
having
lost
her
beauty
she
had
attained
ideal
perfection
still
i
remember
several
persons
at
that
time
used
to
declare
that
she
had
changed
very
much
which
with
them
meant
that
she
had
greatly
deteriorated
beauty
however
is
like
a
temple
in
which
the
profane
see
naught
but
the
external
magnificence
the
divine
mystery
of
the
artist
s
thought
reveals
itself
only
to
profound
sympathy
and
the
inspiration
in
each
detail
of
the
sublime
work
remains
unseen
by
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
one
of
your
modern
authors
i
fancy
has
said
this
in
other
words
and
much
better
as
for
myself
at
no
moment
in
her
life
did
i
find
edmee
less
beautiful
than
at
any
other
even
in
the
hours
of
suffering
when
beauty
in
its
material
sense
seems
obliterated
hers
but
assumed
a
divine
form
in
my
eyes
and
in
her
face
i
beheld
the
splendour
of
a
new
moral
beauty
however
i
am
but
indifferently
endowed
with
artistic
feeling
and
had
i
been
a
painter
i
could
not
have
created
more
than
a
single
type
that
which
filled
my
whole
soul
for
in
the
course
of
my
long
life
only
one
woman
has
seemed
to
me
really
beautiful
and
that
woman
was
edmee
for
a
few
seconds
i
stood
looking
at
her
so
touchingly
pale
sad
yet
calm
a
living
image
of
filial
piety
of
power
in
thrall
to
affection
then
i
rushed
forward
and
fell
at
her
feet
without
being
able
to
say
a
word
she
uttered
no
cry
no
exclamation
of
surprise
but
took
my
head
in
her
two
arms
and
held
it
for
some
time
pressed
to
her
bosom
in
this
strong
pressure
in
this
silent
joy
i
recognised
the
blood
of
my
race
i
felt
the
touch
of
a
sister
the
good
chevalier
who
had
waked
with
a
start
stared
at
us
in
astonishment
his
body
bent
forward
and
his
elbow
resting
on
his
knee
then
he
said
well
well
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
could
not
see
my
face
hidden
as
it
was
in
edmee
s
breast
she
pushed
me
towards
him
and
the
old
man
clasped
me
in
his
feeble
arms
with
a
burst
of
generous
affection
that
gave
him
back
for
a
moment
the
vigour
of
youth
i
leave
you
to
imagine
the
questions
with
which
i
was
overwhelmed
and
the
attentions
that
were
lavished
on
me
edmee
was
a
veritable
mother
to
me
her
unaffected
kindness
and
confidence
savoured
so
much
of
heaven
that
throughout
the
day
i
could
not
think
of
her
otherwise
than
if
i
had
really
been
her
son
i
was
very
much
touched
at
the
pleasure
they
took
in
preparing
a
big
surprise
for
the
abbe
i
saw
in
this
a
sure
proof
of
the
delight
he
would
feel
at
my
return
they
made
me
hide
under
edmee
s
frame
and
covered
me
with
the
large
green
cloth
that
was
generally
thrown
over
her
work
the
abbe
sat
down
quite
close
to
me
and
i
gave
a
shout
and
seized
him
by
the
legs
this
was
a
little
practical
joke
that
i
used
to
play
on
him
in
the
old
days
when
throwing
aside
the
frame
and
sending
the
balls
of
wool
rolling
over
the
floor
i
came
out
from
my
the
expression
of
terror
and
delight
on
his
face
was
most
quaint
but
i
will
spare
you
all
these
family
scenes
to
which
my
memory
goes
back
too
readily
xvii
an
immense
change
had
taken
place
in
me
during
the
course
of
six
years
i
had
become
a
man
very
much
like
other
men
my
instincts
had
managed
to
bring
themselves
into
harmony
with
my
affections
my
intuitions
with
my
reason
this
social
education
had
been
carried
on
quite
naturally
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
accept
the
lessons
of
experience
and
the
counsels
of
friendship
i
was
far
from
being
a
learned
man
but
i
had
developed
a
power
of
acquiring
solid
learning
very
rapidly
my
notions
of
things
in
general
were
as
clear
as
could
be
obtained
at
that
time
since
then
i
know
that
real
progress
has
been
made
in
human
knowledge
i
have
watched
it
from
afar
and
have
never
thought
of
denying
it
and
as
i
notice
that
not
all
men
of
my
age
show
themselves
as
reasonable
it
pleases
me
to
think
that
i
was
put
on
a
fairly
right
road
early
in
life
since
i
have
never
stopped
in
the
blind
alley
of
errors
and
prejudices
the
progress
i
had
made
intellectually
seemed
to
satisfy
edmee
i
am
not
astonished
at
it
she
said
i
could
see
it
in
your
letters
but
i
rejoice
at
it
with
a
mother
s
my
good
uncle
was
no
longer
strong
enough
to
engage
in
the
old
stormy
discussions
and
i
really
think
that
if
he
had
retained
his
strength
he
would
have
been
somewhat
grieved
to
find
that
i
was
no
longer
the
indefatigable
opponent
who
had
formerly
irritated
him
so
persistently
he
even
made
a
few
attempts
at
contradiction
to
test
me
but
at
this
time
i
should
have
considered
it
a
crime
to
have
gratified
him
he
showed
a
little
temper
at
this
and
seemed
to
think
that
i
treated
him
too
much
as
an
old
man
to
console
him
i
turned
the
conversation
to
the
history
of
the
past
to
the
years
through
which
he
himself
had
lived
and
questioned
him
on
many
points
wherein
his
experience
served
him
better
than
my
knowledge
in
this
way
i
obtained
many
healthy
notions
for
the
guidance
of
my
own
conduct
and
at
the
same
time
i
fully
satisfied
his
legitimate
he
now
conceived
a
friendship
for
me
from
genuine
sympathy
just
as
formerly
he
had
adopted
me
from
natural
generosity
and
family
pride
he
did
not
disguise
from
me
that
his
great
desire
before
falling
into
the
sleep
that
knows
no
waking
was
to
see
me
married
to
edmee
and
when
i
told
him
that
this
was
the
one
thought
of
my
life
the
one
wish
of
my
soul
he
said
i
know
i
know
everything
depends
on
her
and
i
think
she
can
no
longer
have
any
reasons
for
hesitation
at
all
events
he
added
after
a
moment
s
silence
and
with
a
touch
of
peevishness
i
can
not
see
any
that
she
could
allege
at
from
these
words
the
first
he
had
ever
uttered
on
the
subject
which
most
interested
me
i
concluded
that
he
himself
had
long
been
favourable
to
my
suit
and
that
the
obstacle
if
one
still
existed
lay
with
edmee
my
uncle
s
last
remark
implied
a
doubt
which
i
dared
not
try
to
clear
up
and
which
caused
me
great
uneasiness
edmee
s
sensitive
pride
inspired
me
with
such
awe
her
unspeakable
goodness
filled
me
with
such
respect
that
i
dared
not
ask
her
to
decide
my
fate
i
made
up
my
mind
to
act
as
if
i
entertained
no
other
hope
than
that
she
would
always
let
me
be
her
brother
and
friend
an
event
which
long
remained
inexplicable
afforded
some
distraction
to
my
thoughts
for
a
few
days
at
first
i
had
refused
to
go
and
take
possession
of
you
really
must
my
uncle
had
said
go
and
see
the
improvements
i
have
made
in
your
property
the
lands
which
have
been
brought
under
cultivation
the
cattle
that
i
have
put
on
each
of
your
now
is
the
time
for
you
to
see
how
your
affairs
stand
and
show
your
tenants
that
you
take
an
interest
in
their
work
otherwise
on
my
death
everything
will
go
from
bad
to
worse
and
you
will
be
obliged
to
let
it
which
may
bring
you
in
a
larger
income
perhaps
but
will
diminish
the
value
of
the
property
i
am
too
old
now
to
go
and
manage
your
estate
for
the
last
two
years
i
have
been
unable
to
leave
off
this
miserable
the
abbe
does
not
understand
anything
about
it
edmee
has
an
excellent
head
but
she
can
not
bring
herself
to
go
to
that
place
she
says
she
would
be
too
much
afraid
which
is
mere
i
know
that
i
ought
to
display
more
courage
i
replied
and
yet
uncle
what
you
are
asking
me
to
do
is
for
me
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
i
have
not
set
foot
on
that
accursed
soil
since
the
day
i
left
it
bearing
edmee
away
from
her
captors
it
is
as
if
you
were
driving
me
out
of
heaven
to
send
me
on
a
visit
to
the
chevalier
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
abbe
implored
me
to
bring
myself
to
do
as
he
wished
as
the
reluctance
i
showed
was
a
veritable
disappointment
to
my
uncle
i
consented
and
with
a
determination
to
conquer
myself
i
took
leave
of
edmee
for
two
days
the
abbe
wanted
to
accompany
me
to
drive
away
the
gloomy
thoughts
which
would
no
doubt
besiege
me
but
i
had
scruples
about
taking
him
from
edmee
even
for
this
short
time
i
knew
how
necessary
he
was
to
her
tied
as
she
was
to
the
chevalier
s
her
life
was
so
serious
so
retired
that
the
least
change
was
acutely
felt
each
year
had
increased
her
isolation
and
it
had
become
almost
complete
since
the
chevalier
s
failing
health
had
driven
from
his
table
those
happy
children
of
wine
songs
and
witticisms
he
had
been
a
great
sportsman
and
saint
hubert
s
day
which
fell
on
his
birthday
had
formerly
brought
all
the
nobility
of
the
province
to
his
house
year
after
year
the
courtyards
had
resounded
with
the
howls
of
the
pack
year
after
year
the
stables
had
held
their
two
long
rows
of
spirited
horses
in
their
glistening
stalls
year
after
year
the
sound
of
the
horn
had
echoed
through
the
great
woods
around
or
sent
out
its
blast
under
the
windows
of
the
big
hall
at
each
toast
of
the
brilliant
company
but
those
glorious
days
had
long
disappeared
the
chevalier
had
given
up
hunting
and
the
hope
of
obtaining
his
daughter
s
hand
no
longer
brought
round
his
young
men
who
were
bored
by
his
old
age
his
attacks
of
gout
and
the
stories
which
he
would
repeat
in
the
evening
without
remembering
that
he
had
already
told
them
in
the
morning
edmee
s
obstinate
refusals
and
the
dismissal
of
de
la
marche
had
caused
great
astonishment
and
given
rise
to
many
conjectures
among
the
curious
one
young
man
who
was
in
love
with
her
and
had
been
rejected
like
the
rest
was
impelled
by
a
stupid
and
cowardly
conceit
to
avenge
himself
on
the
only
woman
of
his
own
class
who
according
to
him
had
dared
to
repulse
him
having
discovered
that
edmee
had
been
carried
off
by
the
hamstringers
he
spread
a
report
that
she
had
spent
a
night
of
wild
debauch
at
at
best
he
only
deigned
to
concede
that
she
had
yielded
only
to
violence
edmee
commanded
too
much
respect
and
esteem
to
be
accused
of
having
shown
complaisance
to
the
brigands
but
she
soon
passed
for
having
been
a
victim
of
their
brutality
marked
with
an
indelible
stain
she
was
no
longer
sought
in
marriage
by
any
one
my
absence
only
served
to
confirm
this
opinion
i
had
saved
her
from
death
it
was
said
but
not
from
shame
and
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
make
her
my
wife
i
was
in
love
with
her
and
had
fled
lest
i
should
yield
to
the
temptation
to
marry
her
all
this
seemed
so
probable
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
make
the
public
accept
the
true
version
they
were
the
less
ready
to
accept
it
from
the
fact
that
edmee
had
been
unwilling
to
put
an
end
to
the
evil
reports
by
giving
her
hand
to
a
man
she
could
not
love
such
then
were
the
causes
of
her
isolation
it
was
not
until
later
that
i
fully
understood
them
but
i
could
see
the
austerity
of
the
chevalier
s
home
and
edmee
s
melancholy
calm
and
i
was
afraid
to
drop
even
a
dry
leaf
in
the
sleeping
waters
thus
i
begged
the
abbe
to
remain
with
them
until
my
return
i
took
no
one
with
me
except
my
faithful
sergeant
marcasse
edmee
had
declared
that
he
must
not
leave
me
and
had
arranged
that
henceforth
he
was
to
share
patience
s
elegant
hut
and
administrative
life
i
arrived
at
one
foggy
evening
in
the
early
days
of
autumn
the
sun
was
hidden
and
all
nature
was
wrapped
in
silence
and
mist
the
plains
were
deserted
the
air
alone
seemed
alive
with
the
noise
of
great
flocks
of
birds
of
passage
cranes
were
drawing
their
gigantic
triangles
across
the
sky
and
storks
at
an
immeasurable
height
were
filling
the
clouds
with
mournful
cries
which
fell
upon
the
saddened
country
like
the
dirge
of
parting
summer
for
the
first
time
in
the
year
i
felt
a
chilliness
in
the
air
i
think
that
all
men
are
filled
with
an
involuntary
sadness
at
the
approach
of
the
inclement
season
in
the
first
there
is
something
which
bids
man
remember
the
approaching
dissolution
of
his
own
being
my
companion
and
i
had
traversed
woods
and
heaths
without
saying
a
single
word
we
had
made
a
long
to
avoid
gazeau
tower
which
i
felt
i
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
again
the
sun
was
sinking
in
shrouds
of
gray
when
we
passed
the
portcullis
at
this
portcullis
was
broken
the
drawbridge
was
never
raised
and
the
only
things
that
crossed
it
now
were
peaceful
flocks
and
their
careless
shepherds
the
fosses
were
and
the
bluish
osiers
were
already
spreading
out
their
flexible
branches
over
the
shallow
waters
nettles
were
growing
at
the
foot
of
the
crumbling
towers
and
the
traces
of
the
fire
seemed
still
fresh
upon
the
walls
the
farm
buildings
had
all
been
repaired
and
the
court
full
of
cattle
and
poultry
and
and
agricultural
implements
contrasted
strangely
with
the
gloomy
inclosure
in
which
i
still
seemed
to
see
the
red
flames
of
the
besiegers
shooting
up
and
the
black
blood
of
the
mauprats
flowing
i
was
received
with
the
quiet
and
somewhat
chilly
hospitality
of
the
peasants
of
berry
they
did
not
lay
themselves
out
to
please
me
but
they
let
me
want
for
nothing
quarters
were
found
for
me
in
the
only
one
of
the
old
wings
which
had
not
been
damaged
in
the
siege
or
subsequently
abandoned
to
the
ravages
of
time
the
massive
architecture
of
the
body
of
the
building
dated
from
the
tenth
century
the
door
was
smaller
than
the
windows
and
the
windows
themselves
gave
so
little
light
that
we
had
to
take
candles
to
find
our
way
although
the
sun
had
hardly
set
the
building
had
been
restored
provisionally
to
serve
as
an
occasional
lodging
for
the
new
seigneur
or
his
stewards
my
uncle
hubert
had
often
been
there
to
see
to
my
interests
so
long
as
his
strength
had
allowed
him
and
they
showed
me
to
the
room
which
he
had
reserved
for
himself
and
which
had
therefore
been
known
as
the
master
s
room
the
best
things
that
had
been
saved
from
the
old
furniture
had
been
placed
there
and
as
it
was
cold
and
damp
in
spite
of
all
the
trouble
they
had
taken
to
make
it
habitable
the
tenant
s
servant
preceded
me
with
a
firebrand
in
one
hand
and
a
fagot
in
the
other
blinded
by
the
smoke
which
she
scattered
round
me
in
clouds
and
deceived
by
the
new
entrance
which
they
had
made
in
another
part
of
the
courtyard
and
by
certain
corridors
which
they
had
walled
up
to
save
the
trouble
of
looking
after
them
i
reached
the
room
without
recognising
anything
indeed
i
could
not
have
said
in
what
part
of
the
old
buildings
i
was
to
such
an
extent
had
the
new
appearance
of
the
courtyard
upset
my
recollections
and
so
little
had
my
mind
in
its
gloom
and
agitation
been
impressed
by
surrounding
objects
while
the
servant
was
lighting
the
fire
i
threw
myself
into
a
chair
and
burying
my
head
in
my
hands
fell
into
a
melancholy
train
of
thought
my
position
however
was
not
without
a
certain
charm
for
the
past
naturally
appears
in
an
embellished
or
softened
form
to
the
minds
of
young
men
those
presumptuous
masters
of
the
future
when
by
dint
of
blowing
the
brand
the
servant
had
filled
the
room
with
dense
smoke
she
went
off
to
fetch
some
embers
and
left
me
alone
marcasse
had
remained
in
the
stable
to
attend
to
our
horses
blaireau
had
followed
me
lying
down
by
the
hearth
he
glanced
at
me
from
time
to
time
with
a
dissatisfied
air
as
if
to
ask
me
the
reason
of
such
wretched
lodging
and
such
a
poor
fire
suddenly
as
i
cast
my
eyes
round
the
room
old
memories
seemed
to
awaken
in
me
the
fire
after
making
the
green
wood
hiss
sent
a
flame
up
the
chimney
and
the
whole
room
was
illumined
with
a
bright
though
unsteady
light
which
gave
all
the
objects
a
weird
ambiguous
appearance
blaireau
rose
turned
his
back
to
the
fire
and
sat
down
between
my
legs
as
if
he
thought
that
something
strange
and
unexpected
was
going
to
happen
i
then
realized
that
this
place
was
none
other
than
my
grandfather
tristan
s
afterward
occupied
for
several
years
by
his
eldest
son
the
detestable
john
my
cruelest
oppressor
the
most
crafty
and
cowardly
of
the
hamstringers
i
was
filled
with
a
sense
of
terror
and
disgust
on
recognising
the
furniture
even
the
very
bed
with
twisted
posts
on
which
my
grandfather
had
given
up
his
blackened
soul
to
god
amid
all
the
torments
of
a
lingering
death
agony
the
which
i
was
sitting
in
was
the
one
in
which
john
the
crooked
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
himself
in
his
facetious
days
used
to
sit
and
think
out
his
villainies
or
issue
his
odious
orders
at
this
moment
i
thought
i
saw
the
ghosts
of
all
the
mauprats
passing
before
me
with
their
bloody
hands
and
their
eyes
dulled
with
wine
i
got
up
and
was
about
to
yield
to
the
horror
i
felt
by
taking
to
flight
when
suddenly
i
saw
a
figure
rise
up
in
front
of
me
so
distinct
so
recognisable
so
different
in
its
vivid
reality
from
the
chimeras
that
had
just
besieged
me
that
i
fell
back
in
my
chair
all
bathed
in
a
cold
sweat
standing
by
the
bed
was
john
mauprat
he
had
just
got
out
for
he
was
holding
the
curtain
in
his
hand
he
seemed
to
me
the
same
as
formerly
only
he
was
still
thinner
and
paler
and
more
hideous
his
head
was
shaved
and
his
body
wrapped
in
a
dark
he
gave
me
a
hellish
glance
a
smile
full
of
hate
and
contempt
played
on
his
thin
shrivelled
lips
he
stood
motionless
with
his
gleaming
eyes
fixed
on
me
and
seemed
as
if
about
to
speak
in
that
instant
i
was
convinced
that
what
i
was
looking
on
was
a
living
being
a
man
of
flesh
and
blood
it
seems
incredible
therefore
that
i
should
have
felt
paralyzed
by
such
childish
fear
but
it
would
be
idle
for
me
to
deny
it
nor
have
i
ever
yet
been
able
to
find
an
explanation
i
was
riveted
to
the
ground
with
fear
the
man
s
glance
petrified
me
i
could
not
utter
a
sound
blaireau
rushed
at
him
then
he
waved
the
folds
of
his
funeral
garment
like
a
shroud
all
foul
with
the
dampness
of
the
tomb
and
i
fainted
when
i
recovered
consciousness
marcasse
was
by
my
side
anxiously
endeavouring
to
lift
me
i
was
lying
on
the
ground
rigid
as
a
corpse
it
was
with
a
great
difficulty
that
i
collected
my
thoughts
but
as
soon
as
i
could
stand
upright
i
seized
marcasse
and
hurriedly
dragged
him
out
of
the
accursed
room
i
had
several
narrow
escapes
of
falling
as
i
hastened
down
the
winding
stairs
and
it
was
only
on
breathing
the
evening
air
in
the
courtyard
and
smelling
the
healthy
odour
of
the
stables
that
i
recovered
the
use
of
my
reason
i
did
not
hesitate
to
look
upon
what
had
just
happened
as
an
hallucination
i
had
given
proof
of
my
courage
in
war
in
the
presence
of
my
worthy
sergeant
i
did
not
blush
therefore
to
confess
the
truth
to
him
i
answered
his
questions
frankly
and
i
described
my
horrible
vision
with
such
minute
details
that
he
too
was
impressed
with
the
reality
of
it
and
as
he
walked
about
with
me
in
the
courtyard
kept
repeating
with
a
thoughtful
air
singular
singular
astonishing
no
it
is
not
astonishing
i
said
when
i
felt
that
i
had
quite
recovered
i
experienced
a
most
painful
sensation
on
my
way
here
for
several
days
i
had
struggled
to
overcome
my
aversion
to
seeing
again
last
night
i
had
a
nightmare
and
i
felt
so
exhausted
and
depressed
this
morning
that
if
i
had
not
been
afraid
of
offending
my
uncle
i
should
have
postponed
this
disagreeable
visit
as
we
entered
the
place
i
felt
a
chill
come
over
me
there
seemed
to
be
a
weight
on
my
chest
and
i
could
not
breathe
probably
too
the
pungent
smoke
that
filled
the
room
disturbed
my
brain
again
after
all
the
hardships
and
dangers
of
our
terrible
voyage
from
which
we
have
hardly
recovered
either
of
us
is
it
astonishing
that
my
nerves
gave
way
at
the
first
painful
emotion
tell
me
replied
marcasse
who
was
still
pondering
the
matter
did
you
notice
blaireau
at
the
moment
what
did
blaireau
do
i
thought
i
saw
blaireau
rush
at
the
phantom
at
the
moment
when
it
disappeared
but
i
suppose
i
dreamt
that
like
the
hum
said
the
sergeant
when
i
entered
blaireau
was
wildly
excited
he
kept
coming
to
you
sniffing
whining
in
his
way
running
to
the
bed
scratching
the
wall
coming
to
me
running
to
you
strange
that
astonishing
captain
astonishing
that
after
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
devil
don
t
return
he
exclaimed
shaking
his
head
dead
never
return
besides
why
dead
john
not
dead
still
two
mauprats
who
knows
where
the
devil
dead
don
t
return
and
my
master
mad
never
ill
after
this
colloquy
the
sergeant
went
and
fetched
a
light
drew
his
faithful
sword
from
the
scabbard
whistled
blaireau
and
bravely
seized
the
rope
which
served
as
a
balustrade
for
the
staircase
requesting
me
to
remain
below
great
as
was
my
repugnance
to
entering
the
room
again
i
did
not
hesitate
to
follow
marcasse
in
spite
of
his
recommendation
our
first
care
was
to
examine
the
bed
but
while
we
had
been
talking
in
the
courtyard
the
servant
had
brought
clean
sheets
had
made
the
bed
and
was
now
smoothing
the
blankets
who
has
been
sleeping
there
asked
marcasse
with
his
usual
caution
nobody
she
replied
except
le
chevalier
or
l
abbe
aubert
in
the
days
when
they
used
to
but
yesterday
or
i
mean
said
marcasse
oh
yesterday
and
nobody
sir
for
it
is
quite
two
years
since
le
chevalier
came
here
and
as
for
l
abbe
he
never
sleeps
here
now
that
he
comes
alone
he
arrives
in
the
morning
has
lunch
with
us
and
goes
back
in
the
but
the
bed
was
disarranged
said
marcasse
looking
at
her
attentively
oh
well
that
may
be
sir
she
replied
i
do
not
know
how
they
left
it
the
last
time
some
one
slept
here
i
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
that
as
i
put
on
the
sheets
all
i
know
is
that
bernard
s
cloak
was
lying
on
the
my
cloak
i
exclaimed
it
was
left
in
the
and
mine
too
said
marcasse
i
have
just
folded
both
together
and
put
them
on
the
you
must
have
had
two
then
replied
the
servant
for
i
am
sure
i
took
one
off
the
bed
it
was
a
black
cloak
not
mine
as
a
fact
was
lined
with
red
and
trimmed
with
gold
lace
marcasse
s
was
light
gray
it
could
not
therefore
have
been
one
of
our
cloaks
brought
up
for
a
moment
by
the
man
and
then
taken
back
to
the
stable
but
what
did
you
do
with
it
said
the
sergeant
my
word
sir
replied
the
fat
girl
i
put
it
there
over
the
you
must
have
taken
it
while
i
went
to
get
a
candle
i
can
t
see
it
we
searched
the
room
thoroughly
the
cloak
was
not
to
be
found
we
pretended
that
we
needed
it
not
denying
that
it
was
ours
the
servant
unmade
the
bed
in
our
presence
and
then
went
and
asked
the
man
what
he
had
done
with
it
nothing
could
be
found
either
in
the
bed
or
in
the
room
the
man
had
not
been
upstairs
all
the
were
in
a
state
of
excitement
fearing
that
some
one
might
be
accused
of
theft
we
inquired
if
a
stranger
had
not
come
to
and
if
he
was
not
still
there
when
we
ascertained
that
these
good
people
had
neither
housed
or
seen
any
one
we
reassured
them
about
the
lost
cloak
by
saying
that
marcasse
had
accidentally
folded
it
with
the
two
others
then
we
shut
ourselves
in
the
room
in
order
to
explore
it
at
our
ease
for
it
was
now
almost
evident
that
what
i
had
seen
was
by
no
means
a
ghost
but
john
mauprat
himself
or
a
man
very
like
him
whom
i
had
mistaken
for
john
marcasse
having
aroused
blaireau
by
voice
and
gesture
watched
all
his
movements
set
your
mind
at
rest
he
said
with
pride
the
old
dog
has
not
forgotten
his
old
trade
if
there
is
a
hole
a
hole
as
big
as
your
hand
have
no
fear
now
old
dog
have
no
blaireau
indeed
after
sniffing
everywhere
persisted
in
scratching
the
wall
where
i
had
seen
the
apparition
he
would
start
back
every
time
his
pointed
nose
came
to
a
certain
spot
in
the
wainscotting
then
wagging
his
bushy
tail
with
a
satisfied
air
he
would
return
to
his
master
as
if
to
tell
him
to
concentrate
his
attention
on
this
spot
the
sergeant
then
began
to
examine
the
wall
and
the
woodwork
he
tried
to
insinuate
his
sword
into
some
crack
there
was
no
sign
of
an
opening
still
a
door
might
have
been
there
for
the
flowers
carved
on
the
woodwork
would
hide
a
skilfully
constructed
sliding
panel
the
essential
thing
was
to
find
the
spring
that
made
this
panel
work
but
that
was
impossible
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
we
made
for
two
long
hours
in
vain
did
we
try
to
shake
the
panel
it
gave
forth
the
same
sound
as
the
others
they
were
all
sonorous
showing
that
the
wainscot
was
not
in
immediate
contact
with
the
masonry
still
there
might
be
a
gap
of
only
a
few
inches
between
them
at
last
marcasse
perspiring
profusely
stopped
and
said
to
me
this
is
very
stupid
if
we
searched
all
night
we
should
not
find
a
spring
if
there
is
none
and
however
hard
we
hammered
we
could
not
break
in
the
door
if
there
happened
to
be
big
iron
bars
behind
it
as
i
have
sometimes
seen
in
other
old
the
axe
might
help
us
to
find
a
passage
i
said
if
there
is
one
but
why
simply
because
your
dog
scratches
the
wall
persist
in
believing
that
john
mauprat
or
the
man
who
resembles
him
could
not
have
come
in
and
gone
out
by
the
door
come
in
if
you
like
replied
marcasse
but
gone
out
no
on
my
honour
for
as
the
servant
came
down
i
was
on
the
staircase
brushing
my
boots
as
soon
as
i
heard
something
fall
here
i
rushed
up
quickly
three
stairs
at
a
time
and
found
that
it
was
you
like
a
corpse
stretched
out
on
the
floor
very
ill
no
one
inside
nor
outside
on
my
honour
in
that
case
then
i
must
have
dreamt
of
my
fiend
of
an
uncle
and
the
servant
must
have
dreamt
of
the
black
cloak
for
it
is
pretty
certain
that
there
is
no
secret
door
here
and
even
if
there
were
one
and
all
the
mauprats
living
and
dead
knew
the
secret
of
it
what
were
that
to
us
do
we
belong
to
the
police
that
we
should
hunt
out
these
wretched
creatures
and
if
by
chance
we
found
them
hidden
somewhere
should
we
not
help
them
to
escape
rather
than
hand
them
over
to
justice
we
are
armed
we
need
not
be
afraid
that
they
will
assassinate
us
and
if
they
amuse
themselves
by
frightening
us
my
word
woe
betide
them
i
have
no
eye
for
either
relatives
or
friends
when
i
am
startled
in
my
sleep
so
come
let
us
attack
the
omelette
that
these
good
people
my
tenants
are
preparing
for
us
for
if
we
continue
knocking
and
scratching
the
walls
they
will
think
we
are
marcasse
yielded
from
a
sense
of
duty
rather
than
from
conviction
he
seemed
to
attach
great
importance
to
the
discovery
of
this
mystery
and
to
be
far
from
easy
in
his
mind
he
was
unwilling
to
let
me
remain
alone
in
the
haunted
room
and
pretended
that
i
might
fall
ill
again
and
have
a
fit
oh
this
time
i
said
i
shall
not
play
the
coward
the
cloak
has
cured
me
of
my
fear
of
ghosts
and
i
should
not
advise
any
one
to
meddle
with
the
hildago
was
obliged
to
leave
me
alone
i
loaded
my
pistols
and
put
them
on
the
table
within
reach
of
my
hand
but
these
precautions
were
a
pure
waste
of
time
nothing
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
room
and
the
heavy
red
silk
curtains
with
their
coat
of
arms
at
the
corners
in
tarnished
silver
were
not
stirred
by
the
slightest
breath
marcasse
returned
and
delighted
at
finding
me
as
cheerful
as
he
had
left
me
began
preparing
our
supper
with
as
much
care
as
if
we
had
come
to
for
the
sole
purpose
of
making
a
good
meal
he
made
jokes
about
the
capon
which
was
still
singing
on
the
spit
and
about
the
wine
which
was
so
like
a
brush
in
the
throat
his
good
humour
increased
when
the
tenant
appeared
bringing
a
few
bottles
of
excellent
madeira
which
had
been
left
with
him
by
the
chevalier
who
liked
to
drink
a
glass
or
two
before
setting
foot
in
the
stirrup
in
return
we
invited
the
worthy
man
to
sup
with
us
as
the
least
tedious
way
of
discussing
business
matters
good
he
said
it
will
be
like
old
times
when
the
peasants
used
to
eat
at
the
table
of
the
seigneurs
of
you
are
doing
the
same
monsieur
bernard
you
are
quite
yes
sir
i
replied
very
coldly
only
i
behave
thus
with
those
who
owe
me
money
not
those
to
whom
i
owe
this
reply
and
the
word
sir
frightened
him
so
much
that
he
was
at
great
pains
to
excuse
himself
from
sitting
down
to
table
however
i
insisted
as
i
wished
to
give
him
the
measure
of
my
character
at
once
i
treated
him
as
a
man
i
was
raising
to
my
own
level
not
as
one
to
whom
i
wished
to
descend
i
forced
him
to
be
cleanly
in
his
jokes
but
allowed
him
to
be
free
and
facetious
within
the
limits
of
decent
mirth
he
was
a
frank
jovial
man
i
questioned
him
minutely
to
discover
if
he
was
not
in
league
with
the
phantom
who
was
in
the
habit
of
leaving
his
cloak
upon
the
bed
this
however
seemed
far
from
probable
the
man
evidently
had
such
an
aversion
for
the
hamstringers
that
had
not
a
regard
for
my
relationship
held
him
back
he
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
have
given
them
such
a
dressing
in
my
presence
as
they
deserved
but
i
could
not
allow
him
any
license
on
this
point
so
i
requested
him
to
give
me
an
account
of
my
property
which
he
did
with
intelligence
accuracy
and
honesty
as
he
withdrew
i
noticed
that
the
madeira
had
had
considerable
effect
on
him
he
seemed
to
have
no
control
over
his
legs
which
kept
catching
in
the
furniture
and
yet
he
had
been
in
sufficient
possession
of
his
faculties
to
reason
correctly
i
have
always
observed
that
wine
acts
much
more
powerfully
on
the
muscles
of
peasants
than
on
their
nerves
that
they
rarely
lose
their
heads
and
that
on
the
contrary
stimulants
produce
in
them
a
bliss
unknown
to
us
the
pleasure
they
derive
from
drunkenness
is
quite
different
from
ours
and
very
superior
to
our
febrile
exaltation
when
marcasse
and
i
found
ourselves
alone
though
we
were
not
drunk
we
realized
that
the
wine
had
filled
us
with
gaiety
and
which
we
should
not
have
felt
at
even
without
the
adventure
of
the
ghost
accustomed
as
we
were
to
speak
our
thoughts
freely
we
confessed
mutually
and
agreed
that
we
were
much
better
prepared
than
before
supper
to
receive
all
the
bogies
of
varenne
this
word
bogey
reminded
me
of
the
adventure
which
had
brought
me
into
far
from
friendly
contact
with
patience
at
the
age
of
thirteen
marcasse
knew
about
it
already
but
he
knew
very
little
of
my
character
at
that
time
and
i
amused
myself
by
telling
him
of
my
wild
rush
across
the
fields
after
being
thrashed
by
the
sorcerer
this
makes
me
think
i
concluded
by
saying
that
i
have
an
imagination
which
easily
gets
overexcited
and
that
i
am
not
above
fear
of
the
supernatural
thus
the
apparition
just
now
no
matter
no
matter
said
marcasse
looking
at
the
priming
of
my
pistols
and
putting
them
on
the
table
by
my
bed
do
not
forget
that
all
the
hamstringers
are
not
dead
that
if
john
is
in
this
world
he
will
do
harm
until
he
is
under
the
ground
and
trebly
locked
in
the
wine
was
loosening
the
hidalgo
s
tongue
on
those
rare
occasions
when
he
allowed
himself
to
depart
from
his
usual
sobriety
he
was
not
wanting
in
wit
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
me
and
made
a
bed
for
himself
by
the
side
of
mine
my
nerves
were
excited
by
the
incidents
of
the
day
and
i
allowed
myself
therefore
to
speak
of
edmee
not
in
such
a
way
as
to
deserve
the
shadow
of
a
reproach
from
her
if
she
had
heard
my
words
but
more
freely
than
i
might
have
spoken
with
a
man
who
was
as
yet
my
inferior
and
not
my
friend
as
he
became
later
i
could
not
say
exactly
how
much
i
confessed
to
him
of
my
sorrows
and
hopes
and
anxieties
but
those
confidences
had
a
disastrous
effect
as
you
will
soon
see
we
fell
asleep
while
we
were
talking
with
blaireau
at
his
master
s
feet
the
hidalgo
s
sword
across
his
knees
near
the
dog
the
light
between
us
my
pistols
ready
to
hand
my
under
my
pillow
and
the
bolts
shot
nothing
disturbed
our
repose
when
the
sun
awakened
us
the
cocks
were
crowing
merrily
in
the
courtyard
and
the
labourers
were
cracking
their
rustic
jokes
as
they
yoked
the
oxen
under
our
windows
all
the
same
there
is
something
at
the
bottom
of
such
was
marcasse
s
first
remark
as
he
opened
his
eyes
and
took
up
the
conversation
where
he
had
dropped
it
the
night
before
did
you
see
or
hear
anything
during
the
night
i
asked
nothing
at
all
he
replied
all
the
same
blaireau
has
been
disturbed
in
his
sleep
for
my
sword
has
fallen
down
and
then
we
found
no
explanation
of
what
happened
let
who
will
explain
it
i
answered
i
shall
certainly
not
trouble
wrong
wrong
you
are
wrong
that
may
be
my
good
sergeant
but
i
do
not
like
this
room
at
all
and
it
seems
to
me
so
ugly
by
daylight
that
i
feel
that
i
must
get
far
away
from
it
and
breathe
some
pure
well
i
will
go
with
you
but
i
shall
return
i
do
not
want
to
leave
this
to
chance
i
know
what
john
mauprat
is
capable
of
you
don
i
do
not
wish
to
know
and
if
there
is
any
danger
here
for
myself
or
my
friends
i
do
not
wish
you
to
marcasse
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
we
went
round
the
farm
once
more
before
departing
marcasse
was
very
much
struck
with
a
certain
incident
to
which
i
should
have
paid
but
little
attention
the
farmer
wished
to
introduce
me
to
his
wife
but
she
could
not
be
persuaded
to
see
me
and
went
and
hid
herself
in
the
i
attributed
this
to
the
shyness
of
youth
fine
youth
my
word
said
marcasse
youth
like
mine
fifty
years
old
and
more
there
is
something
beneath
it
something
beneath
i
tell
what
the
devil
can
there
be
hum
she
was
very
friendly
with
john
mauprat
in
her
day
she
found
his
crooked
legs
to
her
liking
i
know
about
it
yes
i
know
many
other
things
too
many
things
you
may
take
my
word
you
shall
tell
me
them
the
next
time
we
come
and
that
will
not
be
so
soon
for
my
affairs
are
going
on
much
better
than
if
i
interfered
with
them
and
i
should
not
like
to
get
into
the
habit
of
drinking
madeira
to
prevent
myself
from
being
frightened
at
my
own
shadow
and
now
marcasse
i
must
ask
you
as
a
favour
not
to
tell
any
one
what
has
happened
everybody
has
not
your
respect
for
your
the
man
who
does
not
respect
my
captain
is
an
idiot
answered
the
hidalgo
in
a
tone
of
authority
but
if
you
order
me
i
will
say
he
kept
his
word
i
would
not
on
any
account
have
had
edmee
s
mind
disturbed
by
this
stupid
tale
however
i
could
not
prevent
marcasse
from
carrying
out
his
design
early
the
following
morning
he
disappeared
and
i
learnt
from
patience
that
he
had
returned
to
under
the
pretence
of
having
forgotten
something
xviii
while
marcasse
was
devoting
himself
to
serious
investigations
i
was
spending
days
of
delight
and
agony
in
edmee
s
presence
her
behaviour
so
constant
and
devoted
and
yet
in
many
respects
so
reserved
threw
me
into
continual
alternations
of
joy
and
grief
one
day
while
i
was
taking
a
walk
the
chevalier
had
a
long
conversation
with
her
i
happened
to
return
when
their
discussion
had
reached
its
most
animated
stage
as
soon
as
i
appeared
my
uncle
said
to
me
here
bernard
come
and
tell
edmee
that
you
love
her
that
you
will
make
her
happy
that
you
have
got
rid
of
your
old
faults
do
something
to
get
yourself
accepted
for
things
can
not
go
on
as
they
are
our
position
with
our
neighbours
is
unbearable
and
before
i
go
down
to
the
grave
i
should
like
to
see
my
daughter
s
honour
cleared
from
stain
and
to
feel
sure
that
some
stupid
caprice
of
hers
will
not
cast
her
into
a
convent
when
she
ought
to
be
filling
that
position
in
society
to
which
she
is
entitled
and
which
i
have
worked
all
my
life
to
win
for
her
come
bernard
at
her
feet
lad
have
the
wit
to
say
something
that
will
persuade
her
otherwise
i
shall
think
god
forgive
me
that
it
is
you
that
do
not
love
her
and
do
not
honestly
wish
to
marry
i
great
heavens
i
exclaimed
not
wish
to
marry
her
when
for
seven
years
i
have
had
no
other
thought
when
that
is
the
one
wish
of
my
heart
and
the
only
happiness
my
mind
can
conceive
then
i
poured
forth
all
the
thoughts
that
the
sincerest
passion
could
suggest
she
listened
to
me
in
silence
and
without
withdrawing
her
hands
which
i
covered
with
kisses
but
there
was
a
serious
expression
in
her
eyes
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
made
me
tremble
when
after
reflecting
a
few
moments
she
said
father
you
should
not
doubt
my
word
i
have
promised
to
marry
bernard
i
promised
him
and
i
promised
you
it
is
certain
therefore
that
i
shall
marry
then
she
added
after
a
fresh
pause
and
in
a
still
severe
tone
but
if
father
you
believe
that
you
are
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
what
sort
of
heart
do
you
suppose
i
can
have
that
you
bid
me
think
only
of
myself
and
put
on
my
in
the
hour
of
mourning
for
you
if
on
the
contrary
you
are
as
i
believe
still
full
of
vigour
in
spite
of
your
sufferings
and
destined
to
enjoy
the
love
of
your
family
for
many
a
long
year
yet
why
do
you
urge
me
so
imperiously
to
cut
short
the
time
i
have
requested
is
not
the
question
important
enough
to
demand
my
most
serious
reflection
a
contract
which
is
to
bind
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
on
which
depends
i
do
not
say
my
happiness
for
that
i
would
gladly
sacrifice
to
your
least
wish
but
the
peace
of
my
conscience
and
the
dignity
of
my
conduct
since
no
woman
can
be
sufficiently
sure
of
herself
to
answer
for
a
future
which
has
been
fettered
against
her
will
does
not
such
a
contract
bid
me
weigh
all
its
risks
and
all
its
advantages
for
several
years
at
least
good
god
said
the
chevalier
have
you
not
been
weighing
all
this
for
the
last
seven
years
you
ought
to
have
arrived
at
some
conclusion
about
your
cousin
by
now
if
you
are
willing
to
marry
him
marry
him
but
if
not
for
god
s
sake
say
so
and
let
another
man
come
father
replied
edmee
somewhat
coldly
i
shall
marry
none
but
none
but
him
is
all
very
well
said
the
chevalier
tapping
the
logs
with
the
tongs
but
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
you
will
marry
yes
i
will
marry
him
father
answered
edmee
i
could
have
wished
to
be
free
a
few
months
more
but
since
you
are
displeased
at
all
these
delays
i
am
ready
to
obey
your
orders
as
you
parbleu
that
is
a
pretty
way
of
consenting
exclaimed
my
uncle
and
no
doubt
most
gratifying
to
your
cousin
by
jove
bernard
i
have
lived
many
years
in
this
world
but
i
must
own
that
i
can
t
understand
these
women
yet
and
it
is
very
probable
that
i
shall
die
without
ever
having
understood
uncle
i
said
i
can
quite
understand
my
cousin
s
aversion
for
me
it
is
only
what
i
deserve
i
have
done
all
i
could
to
atone
for
my
errors
but
is
it
altogether
in
her
power
to
forget
a
past
which
has
doubtless
caused
her
too
much
pain
however
if
she
does
not
forgive
me
i
will
imitate
her
severity
i
will
not
forgive
myself
abandoning
all
hope
in
this
world
i
will
tear
myself
away
from
her
and
you
and
chasten
myself
with
a
punishment
worse
than
that
s
it
go
on
there
s
an
end
of
everything
said
the
chevalier
throwing
the
tongs
into
the
fire
that
is
just
what
you
have
been
aiming
at
i
suppose
edmee
i
had
moved
a
few
steps
towards
the
door
i
was
suffering
intensely
edmee
ran
after
me
took
me
by
the
arm
and
brought
me
back
towards
her
father
it
is
cruel
and
most
ungrateful
of
you
to
say
that
she
said
does
it
show
a
modest
spirit
and
generous
heart
to
forget
a
friendship
a
devotion
i
may
even
venture
to
say
a
fidelity
of
seven
years
because
i
ask
to
prove
you
for
a
few
months
more
and
even
if
my
affection
for
you
should
never
be
as
deep
as
yours
for
me
is
what
i
have
hitherto
shown
you
of
so
little
account
that
you
despise
it
and
reject
it
because
you
are
vexed
at
not
inspiring
me
with
precisely
as
much
as
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
you
know
at
this
rate
a
woman
would
have
no
right
to
feel
affection
however
tell
me
is
it
your
wish
to
punish
me
for
having
been
a
mother
to
you
by
leaving
me
altogether
or
to
make
some
return
only
on
condition
that
i
become
your
slave
no
edmee
no
i
replied
with
my
heart
breaking
and
my
eyes
full
of
tears
as
i
raised
her
hand
to
my
lips
i
feel
that
you
have
done
far
more
for
me
than
i
deserved
i
feel
that
it
would
be
idle
to
think
of
tearing
myself
from
your
presence
but
can
you
account
it
a
crime
in
me
to
suffer
by
your
side
in
any
case
it
is
so
involuntary
so
inevitable
a
crime
that
it
must
needs
escape
all
your
reproaches
and
all
my
own
remorse
but
let
us
talk
of
this
no
more
it
is
all
i
can
do
grant
me
your
friendship
still
i
shall
hope
to
show
myself
always
worthy
of
you
in
the
come
kiss
each
other
said
the
chevalier
much
affected
and
never
separate
bernard
however
capricious
edmee
may
seem
never
abandon
her
if
you
would
deserve
the
blessing
of
your
though
you
should
never
be
her
husband
always
be
a
brother
to
her
remember
my
lad
that
she
will
soon
be
alone
in
the
world
and
that
i
shall
die
in
sorrow
if
i
do
not
carry
with
me
to
the
grave
a
conviction
that
a
support
and
a
defender
still
remains
to
her
remember
too
that
it
is
on
your
account
on
account
of
a
vow
which
her
inclination
perhaps
would
reject
but
which
her
conscience
respects
that
she
is
thus
forsaken
and
slandered
the
chevalier
burst
into
tears
and
in
a
moment
all
the
sorrows
of
the
unfortunate
family
were
revealed
to
me
enough
enough
i
cried
falling
at
their
feet
all
this
is
too
cruel
i
should
be
the
meanest
wretch
on
earth
if
i
had
need
to
be
reminded
of
my
misdeeds
and
my
duties
let
me
weep
at
your
knees
let
me
atone
for
the
wrong
i
have
done
you
by
eternal
grief
by
eternal
renunciation
why
not
have
driven
me
away
when
i
did
the
wrong
why
not
uncle
have
blown
out
my
brains
with
your
pistol
as
if
i
had
been
a
wild
beast
what
have
i
done
to
be
spared
i
who
repaid
your
kindness
with
the
ruin
of
your
honour
no
no
i
can
see
that
edmee
ought
not
to
marry
me
that
would
be
accepting
the
shame
of
the
insult
i
have
drawn
upon
her
all
i
ask
is
to
be
allowed
to
remain
here
i
will
never
see
her
face
if
she
makes
this
a
condition
but
i
will
lie
at
her
door
like
a
faithful
dog
and
tear
to
pieces
the
first
man
who
dares
to
present
himself
otherwise
than
on
his
knees
and
if
some
day
an
honest
man
more
fortunate
than
myself
shows
himself
worthy
of
her
love
far
from
opposing
him
i
will
intrust
to
him
the
dear
and
sacred
task
of
protecting
and
vindicating
her
i
will
be
but
a
friend
a
brother
to
her
and
when
i
see
that
they
are
happy
together
i
will
go
far
away
from
them
and
die
in
my
sobs
choked
me
the
chevalier
pressed
his
daughter
and
myself
to
his
heart
and
we
mingled
our
tears
swearing
to
him
that
we
would
never
leave
each
other
either
during
his
life
or
after
his
death
still
do
not
give
up
all
hope
of
marrying
her
whispered
the
chevalier
to
me
a
few
moments
later
when
we
were
somewhat
calmer
she
has
strange
whims
but
nothing
will
persuade
me
to
believe
that
she
does
not
love
you
she
does
not
want
to
explain
matters
yet
woman
s
will
is
god
s
and
edmee
s
will
is
my
will
i
replied
a
few
days
after
this
scene
which
brought
the
calmness
of
death
into
my
soul
in
place
of
the
tumult
of
life
i
was
strolling
in
the
park
with
the
abbe
i
must
tell
you
he
said
of
an
adventure
which
befell
me
yesterday
there
is
a
touch
of
romance
in
it
i
had
been
for
a
walk
in
the
woods
of
briantes
and
had
made
my
way
down
to
the
spring
of
fougeres
it
was
as
warm
you
remember
as
in
the
middle
of
summer
and
our
beautiful
plants
in
their
autumn
red
seemed
more
beautiful
than
ever
as
they
stretched
their
delicate
tracery
over
the
stream
the
trees
have
very
little
foliage
left
but
the
carpet
of
dried
leaves
one
walks
upon
gives
forth
a
sound
which
to
me
is
full
of
charm
the
satiny
trunks
of
the
birches
and
young
oaks
are
covered
with
moss
and
creepers
of
all
shades
of
brown
and
tender
green
and
red
and
fawn
which
spread
out
into
delicate
stars
and
rosettes
and
maps
of
all
countries
wherein
the
imagination
can
behold
new
worlds
in
miniature
i
kept
gazing
lovingly
on
these
marvels
of
grace
and
delicacy
these
arabesques
in
which
infinite
variety
is
combined
with
unfailing
regularity
and
as
i
remembered
with
pleasure
that
you
are
not
like
the
vulgar
blind
to
these
adorable
coquetries
of
nature
i
gathered
a
few
with
the
greatest
care
even
bringing
away
the
bark
of
the
tree
on
which
they
had
taken
root
in
order
not
to
destroy
the
perfection
of
their
designs
i
made
a
little
collection
which
i
left
at
patience
s
as
i
passed
we
will
go
and
see
them
if
you
like
but
on
our
way
i
must
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
as
i
approached
the
spring
i
was
walking
upon
the
wet
stones
with
my
head
down
guided
by
the
slight
noise
of
the
clear
little
jet
of
water
which
bursts
from
the
heart
of
the
mossy
rock
i
was
about
to
sit
down
on
the
stone
which
forms
a
natural
seat
at
the
side
of
it
when
i
saw
that
the
place
was
already
occupied
by
a
good
friar
whose
pale
haggard
face
was
by
his
cowl
of
coarse
cloth
he
seemed
much
frightened
at
my
arrival
i
did
my
best
to
reassure
him
by
declaring
that
my
intention
was
not
to
disturb
him
but
merely
to
put
my
lips
to
the
little
bark
channel
which
the
woodcutters
have
fixed
to
the
rock
to
enable
one
to
drink
more
easily
oh
holy
priest
he
said
to
me
in
the
humblest
tone
why
are
you
not
the
prophet
whose
rod
could
smite
the
founts
of
grace
and
why
can
not
my
soul
like
this
rock
give
forth
a
stream
of
tears
struck
by
the
manner
in
which
this
monk
expressed
himself
by
his
sad
air
by
his
thoughtful
attitude
in
this
poetic
spot
which
has
often
made
me
dream
of
the
meeting
of
the
saviour
and
the
woman
of
samaria
i
allowed
myself
to
be
drawn
into
a
more
intimate
conversation
i
learnt
from
the
monk
that
he
was
a
trappist
and
that
he
was
making
a
penitential
tour
ask
neither
my
name
nor
whence
i
come
he
said
i
belong
to
an
illustrious
family
who
would
blush
to
know
that
i
am
still
alive
besides
on
entering
the
trappist
order
we
abjure
all
pride
in
the
past
we
make
ourselves
like
children
we
become
dead
to
the
world
that
we
may
live
again
in
jesus
christ
but
of
this
be
sure
you
behold
in
me
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
of
the
miraculous
power
of
grace
and
if
i
could
make
known
to
you
the
tale
of
my
religious
life
of
my
terrors
my
remorse
and
my
expiations
you
would
certainly
be
touched
by
it
but
of
what
avail
the
indulgence
and
compassion
of
man
if
the
pity
of
god
will
not
deign
to
absolve
me
you
know
continued
the
abbe
that
i
do
not
like
monks
that
i
distrust
their
humility
and
abhor
their
lives
of
inaction
but
this
man
spoke
in
so
sad
and
kindly
a
manner
he
was
so
filled
with
a
sense
of
his
duty
he
seemed
so
ill
so
emaciated
by
asceticism
so
truly
penitent
that
he
won
my
heart
in
his
looks
and
in
his
talk
were
bright
flashes
which
betrayed
a
powerful
intellect
indefatigable
energy
and
indomitable
perseverance
we
spent
two
whole
hours
together
and
i
was
so
moved
by
what
he
said
that
on
leaving
him
i
expressed
a
wish
to
see
him
again
before
he
left
this
neighbourhood
he
had
found
a
lodging
for
the
night
at
the
goulets
farm
and
i
tried
in
vain
to
persuade
him
to
accompany
me
to
the
chateau
he
told
me
that
he
had
a
companion
he
could
not
leave
but
since
you
are
so
sympathetic
he
said
i
shall
esteem
it
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
here
towards
sunset
perhaps
i
may
even
venture
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
you
can
be
of
service
to
me
in
an
important
matter
which
i
have
to
arrange
in
this
neighbourhood
more
than
this
i
can
not
tell
you
at
the
present
i
assured
him
that
he
could
reckon
on
me
and
that
i
should
only
be
too
happy
to
oblige
a
man
such
as
and
the
result
is
i
suppose
that
you
are
waiting
impatiently
for
the
hour
of
your
appointment
i
said
to
the
abbe
i
am
he
replied
and
my
new
acquaintance
has
so
many
attractions
for
me
that
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
abusing
the
confidence
he
has
placed
in
me
i
should
take
edmee
to
the
spring
of
i
fancy
i
replied
that
edmee
has
something
better
to
do
than
to
listen
to
the
declamations
of
your
monk
who
perhaps
after
all
is
only
a
knave
like
so
many
others
to
whom
you
have
given
money
blindly
you
will
forgive
me
i
know
abbe
but
you
are
not
a
good
physiognomist
and
you
are
rather
apt
to
form
a
good
or
bad
opinion
of
people
for
no
reason
except
that
your
own
romantic
nature
happens
to
feel
kindly
or
timidly
disposed
towards
the
abbe
smiled
and
pretended
that
i
said
this
because
i
bore
him
a
grudge
he
again
asserted
his
belief
in
the
trappist
s
piety
and
then
went
back
to
botany
we
passed
some
time
at
patience
s
examining
the
collection
of
plants
and
as
my
one
desire
was
to
escape
from
my
own
thoughts
i
left
the
hut
with
the
abbe
and
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
wood
where
he
was
to
meet
the
monk
in
proportion
as
we
drew
near
to
the
place
the
abbe
seemed
to
lose
more
and
more
of
his
eagerness
of
the
previous
evening
and
even
expressed
a
fear
that
he
had
gone
too
far
this
hesitation
following
so
quickly
upon
enthusiasm
was
very
characteristic
of
the
abbe
s
mobile
loving
timid
nature
with
its
strange
union
of
the
most
contrary
impulses
and
i
again
began
to
rally
him
with
all
the
freedom
of
friendship
come
then
he
said
i
should
like
to
be
satisfied
about
this
you
must
see
him
you
can
study
his
face
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
leave
us
together
since
i
have
promised
to
listen
to
his
as
i
had
nothing
better
to
do
i
followed
the
abbe
but
as
soon
as
we
reached
a
spot
overlooking
the
shady
rocks
whence
the
water
issues
i
stopped
and
examined
the
monk
through
the
branches
of
a
clump
of
seated
immediately
beneath
us
by
the
side
of
the
spring
he
had
his
eyes
turned
inquiringly
on
the
angle
of
the
path
by
which
he
expected
the
abbe
to
arrive
but
he
did
not
think
of
looking
at
the
place
where
we
were
and
we
could
examine
him
at
our
ease
without
being
seen
by
him
no
sooner
had
i
caught
sight
of
him
than
with
a
bitter
laugh
i
took
the
abbe
by
the
arm
drew
him
back
a
short
distance
and
not
without
considerable
agitation
said
to
him
my
dear
abbe
in
bygone
years
did
you
never
catch
sight
of
the
face
of
my
uncle
john
de
mauprat
never
as
far
as
i
know
replied
the
abbe
quite
amazed
but
what
are
you
driving
at
only
this
my
friend
you
have
made
a
pretty
find
here
this
good
and
venerable
trappist
in
whom
you
see
so
much
grace
and
candour
and
contrition
and
intelligence
is
none
other
than
john
de
mauprat
the
you
must
be
mad
cried
the
abbe
starting
back
john
de
mauprat
died
a
long
time
john
mauprat
is
not
dead
nor
perhaps
antony
mauprat
either
and
my
surprise
is
less
than
yours
only
because
i
have
already
met
one
of
these
two
ghosts
that
he
has
become
a
monk
and
is
repenting
for
his
sins
is
very
possible
but
alas
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
that
he
has
disguised
himself
in
order
to
carry
out
some
evil
design
and
i
advise
you
to
be
on
your
the
abbe
was
so
frightened
that
he
no
longer
wanted
to
keep
his
appointment
i
suggested
that
it
would
be
well
to
learn
what
the
old
sinner
was
aiming
at
but
as
i
knew
the
abbe
s
weak
character
and
feared
that
my
uncle
john
would
manage
to
win
his
heart
by
his
lying
confessions
and
wheedle
him
into
some
false
step
i
made
up
my
mind
to
hide
in
a
thicket
whence
i
could
see
and
hear
everything
but
things
did
not
happen
as
i
had
expected
the
trappist
instead
of
playing
the
politician
immediately
made
known
his
real
name
to
the
abbe
he
declared
that
he
was
full
of
contrition
and
that
as
his
conscience
would
not
allow
him
to
make
the
monk
s
habit
a
refuge
from
punishment
he
had
really
been
a
trappist
for
several
years
he
was
about
to
put
himself
into
the
hands
of
justice
that
he
might
atone
in
a
striking
way
for
the
crimes
with
which
he
was
polluted
this
man
endowed
as
he
was
with
conspicuous
abilities
had
acquired
a
mystic
eloquence
in
the
cloister
he
spoke
with
so
much
grace
and
persuasiveness
that
i
was
fascinated
no
less
than
the
abbe
it
was
in
vain
that
the
latter
attempted
to
combat
a
resolution
which
appeared
to
him
insane
john
mauprat
showed
the
most
unflinching
devotion
to
his
religious
ideas
he
declared
that
having
committed
the
crimes
of
the
old
barbarous
paganism
he
could
not
ransom
his
soul
save
by
a
public
expiation
worthy
of
the
early
christians
it
is
possible
he
said
to
be
a
coward
with
god
as
well
as
with
man
and
in
the
silence
of
my
vigils
i
hear
a
terrible
voice
answering
to
my
tears
miserable
craven
it
is
the
fear
of
man
that
has
thrown
you
upon
the
bosom
of
god
and
if
you
had
not
feared
temporal
death
you
would
never
have
thought
of
life
eternal
then
i
realize
that
what
i
most
dread
is
not
god
s
wrath
but
the
rope
and
the
hangman
that
await
me
among
my
fellows
well
it
is
time
to
end
this
sense
of
secret
shame
not
until
the
day
when
men
crush
me
beneath
their
abuse
and
punishment
shall
i
fell
absolved
and
restored
in
the
sight
of
heaven
then
only
shall
i
account
myself
worthy
to
say
to
jesus
my
saviour
give
ear
to
me
innocent
victim
thou
who
heardest
the
penitent
thief
give
ear
to
a
sullied
but
contrite
victim
who
has
shared
in
the
glory
of
thy
martyrdom
and
been
ransomed
by
thy
blood
if
you
persist
in
your
enthusiastic
design
said
the
abbe
after
unsuccessfully
bringing
forward
all
possible
objections
you
must
at
least
let
me
know
in
what
way
you
thought
i
could
be
of
service
to
i
can
not
act
in
this
matter
replied
the
trappist
without
the
consent
of
a
young
man
who
will
soon
be
the
last
of
the
mauprats
for
the
chevalier
has
not
many
days
to
wait
before
he
will
receive
the
heavenly
reward
due
to
his
virtues
and
as
for
myself
i
can
not
avoid
the
punishment
i
am
about
to
seek
except
by
falling
back
into
the
endless
night
of
the
cloister
i
speak
of
bernard
mauprat
i
will
not
call
him
my
nephew
for
if
he
heard
me
he
would
blush
to
think
that
he
bore
this
shameful
title
i
heard
of
his
return
from
america
and
this
news
decided
me
to
undertake
the
journey
at
the
painful
end
of
which
you
now
behold
it
seemed
to
me
that
while
he
was
saying
this
he
kept
casting
towards
the
clump
of
trees
where
i
was
as
if
he
had
guessed
my
presence
there
perhaps
the
movement
of
some
branches
had
betrayed
me
may
i
ask
said
the
abbe
what
you
now
have
in
common
with
this
young
man
are
you
not
afraid
that
embittered
by
the
harsh
treatment
formerly
lavished
on
him
at
he
may
refuse
to
see
you
i
am
certain
that
he
will
refuse
for
i
know
the
hatred
that
he
still
has
for
me
said
the
trappist
once
more
looking
towards
the
spot
where
i
was
but
i
hope
that
you
will
persuade
him
to
grant
me
an
interview
for
you
are
a
good
and
generous
man
monsieur
l
abbe
you
promised
to
oblige
me
and
besides
you
are
young
mauprat
s
friend
and
you
will
be
able
to
make
him
understand
that
his
interests
are
at
stake
and
the
honour
of
his
how
so
answered
the
abbe
no
doubt
he
will
be
far
from
pleased
to
see
you
appear
before
the
courts
to
answer
for
crimes
which
have
since
been
effaced
in
the
gloom
of
the
cloister
he
will
certainly
wish
you
to
forego
this
public
expiation
how
can
you
hope
that
he
will
consent
i
have
hope
because
god
is
good
and
great
because
his
grace
is
mighty
because
it
will
touch
the
heart
of
him
who
shall
deign
to
hear
the
prayer
of
a
soul
which
is
truly
penitent
and
deeply
convinced
because
my
eternal
salvation
is
in
the
hands
of
this
young
man
and
he
can
not
wish
to
avenge
himself
on
me
beyond
the
grave
moreover
i
must
die
at
peace
with
those
i
have
injured
i
must
fall
at
the
feet
of
bernard
mauprat
and
obtain
his
forgiveness
of
my
sins
my
tears
will
move
him
or
if
his
unrelenting
soul
despises
them
i
shall
at
least
have
fulfilled
an
imperious
seeing
that
he
was
speaking
with
a
firm
conviction
that
he
was
being
heard
by
me
i
was
filled
with
disgust
i
thought
i
could
detect
the
deceit
and
cowardice
that
lay
beneath
this
vile
hypocrisy
i
moved
away
and
waited
for
the
abbe
some
distance
off
he
soon
rejoined
me
the
interview
had
ended
by
a
mutual
promise
to
meet
again
soon
the
abbe
had
undertaken
to
convey
the
trappist
s
words
to
me
while
the
latter
had
threatened
in
the
most
honeyed
tone
in
the
world
to
come
and
see
me
if
i
refused
his
request
the
abbe
and
i
agreed
to
consult
together
without
informing
the
chevalier
or
edmee
that
we
might
not
disquiet
them
unnecessarily
the
trappist
had
gone
to
stay
at
la
chatre
at
the
carmelite
convent
this
had
thoroughly
aroused
the
abbe
s
suspicions
in
spite
of
his
first
enthusiasm
at
the
penitence
of
the
sinner
the
carmelites
had
persecuted
him
in
his
youth
and
in
the
end
the
prior
had
driven
him
to
secularize
himself
the
prior
was
still
alive
old
but
implacable
infirm
and
withdrawn
from
the
world
but
strong
in
his
hatred
and
his
passion
for
intrigue
the
abbe
could
not
hear
his
name
without
shuddering
and
he
begged
me
to
act
prudently
in
this
affair
although
john
mauprat
he
said
is
under
the
bane
of
the
law
and
you
are
at
the
summit
of
honour
and
prosperity
do
not
despise
the
weakness
of
your
enemy
who
knows
what
cunning
and
hatred
may
do
they
can
usurp
the
place
of
the
just
and
cast
him
out
on
the
they
can
fasten
their
crimes
on
others
and
sully
the
robe
of
innocence
with
their
vileness
maybe
you
have
not
yet
finished
with
the
the
poor
abbe
did
not
know
that
there
was
so
much
truth
in
his
words
xix
after
thoroughly
reflecting
on
the
trappist
s
probable
intentions
i
decided
that
i
ought
to
grant
him
the
interview
he
had
requested
in
any
case
john
mauprat
could
not
hope
to
impose
upon
me
and
i
wished
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
him
from
pestering
my
s
last
days
with
his
intrigues
accordingly
the
very
next
day
i
betook
myself
to
the
town
where
i
arrived
towards
the
end
of
vespers
i
rang
not
without
emotion
at
the
door
of
the
carmelites
the
retreat
chosen
by
the
trappist
was
of
those
innumerable
mendicant
societies
which
france
supported
at
that
time
though
its
rules
were
ostensibly
most
austere
this
monastery
was
rich
and
devoted
to
pleasure
in
that
age
of
scepticism
the
small
number
of
the
monks
was
entirely
out
of
proportion
to
the
wealth
of
the
establishment
which
had
been
founded
for
them
and
the
friars
who
roamed
about
the
vast
monasteries
in
the
most
remote
parts
of
the
provinces
led
the
easiest
and
idlest
lives
they
had
ever
known
in
the
lap
of
luxury
and
entirely
freed
from
the
control
of
opinion
which
always
loses
its
power
when
man
isolates
himself
but
this
isolation
the
mother
of
the
amiable
vices
as
they
used
to
phrase
it
was
dear
only
to
the
more
ignorant
the
leaders
were
a
prey
to
the
painful
dreams
of
an
ambition
which
had
been
nurtured
in
obscurity
and
embittered
by
inaction
to
do
something
even
in
the
most
limited
sphere
and
with
the
help
of
the
feeblest
machinery
to
do
something
at
all
costs
such
was
the
one
fixed
idea
of
the
priors
and
abbes
the
prior
of
the
carmelites
whom
i
was
about
to
see
was
the
personification
of
this
restless
impotence
bound
to
his
great
by
the
gout
he
offered
a
strange
contrast
to
the
venerable
chevalier
pale
and
unable
to
move
like
himself
but
noble
and
patriarchal
in
his
affliction
the
prior
was
short
stout
and
very
petulant
the
upper
part
of
his
body
was
all
activity
he
would
turn
his
head
rapidly
from
side
to
side
he
would
brandish
his
arms
while
giving
orders
he
was
sparing
of
words
and
his
muffled
voice
seemed
to
lend
a
mysterious
meaning
to
the
most
trivial
things
in
short
of
his
person
seemed
to
be
incessantly
striving
to
drag
along
the
other
like
the
bewitched
man
in
the
arabian
nights
whose
robe
hid
a
body
that
was
marble
up
to
the
waist
he
received
me
with
exaggerated
attention
got
angry
because
they
did
not
bring
me
a
chair
quickly
enough
stretched
out
his
fat
flabby
hand
to
draw
this
chair
quite
close
to
his
own
and
made
a
sign
to
a
tall
bearded
satyr
whom
he
called
the
brother
treasurer
to
go
out
then
after
overwhelming
me
with
questions
about
my
journey
and
my
return
and
my
health
and
my
family
while
his
keen
restless
little
eyes
were
darting
glances
at
me
from
under
eyelids
swollen
and
heavy
from
intemperance
he
came
to
the
point
i
know
my
dear
child
he
said
what
brings
you
here
you
wish
to
pay
your
respects
to
your
holy
relative
to
the
trappist
that
model
of
faith
and
holiness
whom
god
has
sent
to
us
to
serve
as
an
example
to
the
world
and
reveal
to
all
the
miraculous
power
of
prior
i
answered
i
am
not
a
good
enough
christian
to
judge
of
the
miracle
you
mention
let
devout
souls
give
thanks
to
heaven
for
it
for
myself
i
have
come
here
because
jean
de
mauprat
desires
to
inform
me
as
he
has
said
of
plans
which
concern
myself
and
to
which
i
am
ready
to
listen
if
you
will
allow
me
to
go
and
see
him
i
did
not
want
him
to
see
you
before
myself
young
man
exclaimed
the
prior
with
an
affectation
of
frankness
at
the
same
time
seizing
my
hands
in
his
at
the
touch
of
which
i
could
not
repress
a
feeling
of
disgust
i
have
a
favour
to
ask
of
you
in
the
name
of
charity
in
the
name
of
the
blood
which
flows
in
your
veins
i
withdrew
one
of
my
hands
and
the
prior
noticing
my
expression
of
displeasure
immediately
changed
his
tone
with
admirable
skill
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
i
know
you
have
a
grudge
against
him
who
once
was
jean
de
mauprat
and
who
is
the
humble
brother
jean
nepomucene
but
if
the
precepts
of
our
divine
master
jesus
christ
can
not
persuade
you
to
pity
there
are
considerations
of
public
propriety
and
of
family
pride
which
must
make
you
share
my
fears
and
assist
my
efforts
you
know
the
pious
but
rash
resolution
which
brother
john
has
formed
you
ought
to
assist
me
in
dissuading
him
from
it
and
you
will
do
so
i
make
no
possibly
sir
i
replied
very
coldly
but
might
i
ask
to
what
my
family
is
indebted
for
the
interest
you
are
good
enough
to
take
in
its
affairs
to
that
spirit
of
charity
which
animates
all
the
followers
of
christ
answered
the
monk
with
very
well
assumed
dignity
fortified
with
this
pretext
on
the
strength
of
which
the
clergy
have
always
taken
upon
themselves
to
meddle
in
all
family
secrets
it
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
put
an
end
to
my
questions
and
though
he
could
not
destroy
the
suspicions
which
i
felt
at
heart
he
succeeded
in
proving
to
my
ears
that
i
ought
to
be
grateful
to
him
for
the
care
which
he
had
taken
of
the
honour
of
my
name
i
wanted
to
find
out
what
he
was
driving
at
it
was
as
i
had
foreseen
my
uncle
john
claimed
from
me
his
share
in
the
fief
of
and
the
prior
was
deputed
to
make
me
understand
that
i
had
to
choose
between
paying
a
considerable
sum
of
money
for
he
spoke
of
the
interest
accruing
through
the
seven
years
of
possession
besides
a
seventh
part
of
the
whole
estate
and
the
insane
step
he
intended
taking
the
scandal
of
which
could
not
fail
to
hasten
the
chevalier
s
death
and
cause
me
perhaps
strange
personal
all
this
was
hinted
with
consummate
skill
under
the
cover
of
the
most
christian
solicitude
for
my
own
welfare
the
most
fervent
admiration
for
the
trappist
s
zeal
and
the
most
sincere
anxiety
about
the
results
of
this
firm
finally
it
was
made
evident
that
john
mauprat
was
not
coming
to
ask
me
for
the
means
of
existence
but
that
i
should
have
to
humbly
beseech
him
to
accept
the
half
of
my
possessions
if
i
wished
to
prevent
him
from
dragging
my
name
and
probably
my
person
to
the
felon
s
dock
i
tried
a
final
objection
if
i
said
this
resolve
of
brother
nepomucene
as
you
call
him
is
as
fixed
as
you
say
if
the
only
one
care
he
has
in
the
world
is
for
his
own
salvation
will
you
explain
to
me
how
the
attractions
of
temporal
wealth
can
possibly
turn
him
from
it
there
seems
to
be
a
contradiction
in
this
which
i
fail
to
the
prior
was
somewhat
embarrassed
by
the
piercing
glance
i
turned
on
him
but
he
immediately
started
on
one
of
those
exhibitions
of
simplicity
which
are
the
supreme
resource
of
rogues
mon
dieu
my
dear
son
he
exclaimed
you
do
not
know
then
the
immense
consolation
a
pious
soul
can
derive
from
the
possession
of
worldly
wealth
just
as
perishable
riches
must
be
despised
when
they
represent
vain
pleasures
even
so
must
they
be
resolutely
defended
by
the
upright
man
when
they
afford
him
the
means
of
doing
good
i
will
not
hide
from
you
that
if
i
were
the
holy
trappist
i
would
not
yield
my
rights
to
any
one
i
would
found
a
religious
society
for
the
propagation
of
the
faith
and
the
distribution
of
alms
with
the
wealth
which
in
the
hands
of
a
brilliant
young
nobleman
like
yourself
is
only
squandered
on
horses
and
dogs
the
church
teaches
us
that
by
great
sacrifices
and
rich
offerings
we
may
cleanse
our
souls
of
the
blackest
sins
brother
nepomucene
a
prey
to
holy
fear
believes
that
a
public
expiation
is
necessary
for
his
salvation
like
a
devout
martyr
he
wishes
to
satisfy
the
implacable
justice
of
men
with
blood
but
how
much
sweeter
for
you
and
safer
at
the
same
time
to
see
him
raise
some
holy
altar
to
the
glory
of
god
and
hide
in
the
blessed
peace
of
the
cloister
the
baleful
lustre
of
the
name
he
has
already
abjured
he
is
so
much
swayed
by
the
spirit
of
his
order
he
has
conceived
such
a
love
for
for
humility
and
poverty
that
it
will
need
all
my
efforts
and
much
help
from
on
high
to
make
him
agree
to
this
change
of
it
is
you
then
prior
who
from
sheer
goodness
of
heart
are
undertaking
to
alter
this
fatal
resolution
i
admire
your
zeal
and
i
thank
you
for
it
but
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
any
need
of
all
these
negotiations
jean
de
mauprat
claims
his
share
of
the
inheritance
nothing
can
be
more
just
even
should
the
law
refuse
all
civil
rights
to
a
man
who
owed
his
safety
only
to
flight
a
point
which
i
will
pass
over
my
relative
may
rest
assured
that
there
would
never
be
the
least
dispute
between
us
on
this
ground
if
i
were
the
absolute
possessor
of
any
fortune
whatever
but
you
are
doubtless
aware
that
i
owe
the
enjoyment
of
this
fortune
only
to
the
kindness
of
my
the
chevalier
hubert
de
mauprat
that
he
had
enough
to
do
to
pay
the
debts
of
the
family
which
amounted
to
more
than
the
total
value
of
the
estate
that
i
can
alienate
nothing
without
his
permission
and
that
in
reality
i
am
merely
the
depositary
of
a
fortune
which
i
have
not
yet
the
prior
stared
at
me
in
astonishment
as
if
dazed
by
an
unexpected
blow
then
he
smiled
with
a
crafty
expression
and
said
very
good
it
appears
that
i
have
been
mistaken
and
that
i
must
apply
to
hubert
de
mauprat
i
will
do
so
for
i
make
no
doubt
that
he
will
be
very
grateful
to
me
for
saving
his
family
from
a
scandal
which
may
have
very
good
results
for
one
of
his
relatives
in
the
next
world
but
which
for
a
certainty
will
have
very
bad
ones
for
another
relation
in
the
present
i
understand
sir
i
replied
this
is
a
threat
i
will
answer
in
the
same
strain
if
jean
de
mauprat
ventures
to
importune
my
uncle
and
cousin
it
is
with
me
that
he
will
have
to
deal
and
it
will
not
be
before
the
courts
that
i
shall
summon
him
to
answer
for
certain
outrages
which
i
have
by
no
means
forgotten
tell
him
that
i
shall
grant
no
pardon
to
the
trappist
penitent
unless
he
remains
faithful
to
the
role
he
has
adopted
if
jean
de
mauprat
is
without
resources
and
he
asks
my
help
i
may
out
of
the
income
i
receive
furnish
him
with
the
means
of
living
humbly
and
decently
according
to
the
spirit
of
the
vows
he
has
taken
but
if
ecclesiastical
ambition
has
taken
possession
of
his
mind
and
he
thinks
by
stupid
childish
threats
to
intimidate
my
uncle
to
such
an
extent
that
he
will
be
able
to
extort
from
him
the
wherewithal
to
satisfy
his
new
tastes
let
him
undeceive
himself
tell
him
so
from
me
the
old
man
s
peace
of
mind
and
his
daughter
s
future
have
only
myself
as
guardian
and
i
shall
manage
to
guard
them
though
it
be
at
the
risk
of
my
life
and
my
and
yet
honour
and
life
are
of
some
importance
at
your
age
replied
the
abbe
visibly
irritated
but
feigning
a
suaver
manner
than
ever
who
knows
into
what
folly
religious
fervour
may
lead
the
trappist
for
between
ourselves
be
it
said
my
child
you
see
i
am
a
man
of
moderation
i
knew
the
world
in
my
youth
and
i
do
not
approve
of
these
violent
resolves
which
are
more
often
dictated
by
pride
than
piety
for
instance
i
have
consented
to
temper
the
austerity
of
our
rules
my
friars
look
and
they
wear
shirts
rest
assured
my
good
sir
i
am
far
from
approving
of
your
uncle
s
design
and
i
shall
do
all
that
is
possible
to
hinder
it
yet
if
he
still
persists
how
will
my
efforts
profit
you
he
has
obtained
his
superior
s
permission
and
may
after
all
yield
to
his
fatal
inspiration
you
may
be
seriously
compromised
by
an
affair
of
this
kind
for
although
reports
say
that
you
are
a
worthy
young
gentleman
though
you
have
abjured
the
errors
of
the
past
and
though
perhaps
your
soul
has
always
hated
iniquity
you
have
certainly
been
involved
in
many
misdeeds
which
human
laws
condemn
and
punish
who
can
tell
into
what
involuntary
revelations
brother
nepomucene
may
find
himself
drawn
if
he
sets
in
motion
the
machinery
of
criminal
proceedings
can
he
set
it
in
motion
against
himself
without
at
the
same
time
setting
it
in
motion
against
you
believe
me
i
wish
for
peace
i
am
a
kindly
yes
a
very
kindly
man
father
i
answered
in
a
tone
of
irony
i
see
that
perfectly
but
do
not
let
this
matter
cause
you
needless
anxiety
for
there
is
one
very
clear
argument
which
must
reassure
both
of
us
if
a
veritable
religious
impulse
urges
brother
john
the
trappist
to
make
a
public
reparation
it
will
be
easy
to
make
him
understand
that
he
ought
to
hesitate
before
he
drags
another
than
himself
into
the
abyss
the
spirit
of
christ
forbids
him
to
do
this
but
if
the
truth
is
as
i
presume
that
jean
de
mauprat
has
not
the
least
wish
to
hand
himself
over
to
justice
his
threats
are
but
little
calculated
to
terrify
me
and
i
shall
take
steps
to
prevent
them
from
making
more
stir
than
is
so
that
is
the
only
answer
i
am
to
give
him
asked
the
prior
darting
a
vindictive
glance
at
me
yes
sir
i
replied
unless
he
would
prefer
to
come
here
and
receive
the
answer
from
my
own
mouth
i
came
with
a
determination
to
conquer
the
disgust
which
his
presence
arouses
in
me
and
i
am
astonished
that
after
expressing
so
much
eagerness
to
see
me
he
should
remain
in
the
background
when
i
sir
answered
the
prior
with
ridiculous
majesty
my
duty
is
to
see
that
the
peace
of
our
lord
reigns
in
this
holy
place
i
must
therefore
set
myself
against
any
interview
which
might
lead
to
violent
explanations
you
are
much
too
easily
frightened
sir
i
replied
there
is
nothing
to
arouse
passion
in
this
matter
however
as
it
was
not
i
who
called
for
these
explanations
and
as
i
came
here
out
of
pure
compliance
i
most
willingly
refrain
from
pushing
them
further
and
i
thank
you
for
having
been
good
enough
to
act
as
with
that
i
made
a
profound
bow
and
retired
xx
i
gave
an
account
of
this
interview
to
the
abbe
who
was
waiting
for
me
at
patience
s
he
was
entirely
of
my
own
opinion
he
thought
like
myself
that
the
prior
so
far
from
endeavouring
to
turn
the
trappist
from
his
pretended
designs
was
trying
with
all
his
power
to
frighten
me
in
the
hope
that
i
should
be
brought
to
make
considerable
sacrifices
of
money
in
his
eyes
it
was
clear
that
this
old
man
faithful
to
the
monkish
spirit
wished
to
put
into
the
hands
of
a
clerical
mauprat
the
fruit
of
the
labours
and
thrift
of
a
lay
mauprat
that
is
the
indelible
mark
of
the
catholic
clergy
he
said
they
can
not
live
without
waging
war
on
the
families
around
them
and
being
ever
on
the
watch
for
opportunities
to
spoil
them
they
look
upon
this
wealth
as
their
property
and
upon
all
ways
of
recovering
it
as
lawful
it
is
not
as
easy
as
you
think
to
protect
one
s
self
against
this
brigandage
monks
have
stubborn
appetites
and
ingenious
minds
act
with
caution
and
be
prepared
for
anything
you
can
never
induce
a
trappist
to
show
fight
under
the
shelter
of
his
hood
with
head
bowed
and
hands
crossed
he
will
accept
the
cruelest
outrages
and
knowing
quite
well
that
you
will
not
assassinate
him
he
will
hardly
fear
you
again
you
do
not
know
what
justice
can
become
in
man
s
hands
and
how
a
criminal
trial
is
conducted
and
decided
when
one
of
the
parties
will
not
stick
at
any
kind
of
bribery
and
intimidation
the
church
is
powerful
the
law
grandiloquent
the
words
honesty
and
integrity
have
for
centuries
been
ringing
against
the
hardened
walls
of
courts
of
justice
but
that
has
not
prevented
judges
from
being
false
or
verdicts
from
being
iniquitous
have
a
care
have
a
care
the
trappist
may
start
the
cowled
pack
on
his
own
track
and
throw
them
off
by
disappearing
at
the
right
point
and
leading
them
on
yours
remember
that
you
have
wounded
many
an
by
disappointing
the
pretensions
of
the
one
of
the
most
incensed
of
them
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
malicious
is
a
near
relative
of
a
magistrate
who
is
in
the
province
de
la
marche
has
given
up
the
gown
for
the
sword
but
among
his
old
colleagues
he
may
have
left
some
one
who
would
like
to
do
you
an
i
am
sorry
you
were
not
able
to
join
him
in
america
and
get
on
good
terms
with
him
do
not
shrug
your
shoulders
you
may
kill
a
dozen
of
them
and
things
will
go
from
bad
to
worse
they
will
avenge
themselves
not
on
your
life
perhaps
for
they
know
that
you
hold
that
cheap
but
on
your
honour
and
your
will
die
of
grief
in
short
my
dear
abbe
i
said
interrupting
him
you
have
a
habit
of
seeing
everything
black
at
the
first
glance
when
you
do
not
happen
to
see
the
sun
in
the
middle
of
the
night
now
let
me
tell
you
some
things
which
ought
to
drive
out
these
gloomy
presentiments
i
know
john
mauprat
of
old
he
is
a
signal
impostor
and
moreover
the
rankest
of
cowards
he
will
sink
into
the
earth
at
the
sight
of
me
and
as
soon
as
i
speak
i
will
make
him
confess
that
he
is
neither
trappist
nor
monk
nor
saint
all
this
is
a
mere
sharper
s
trick
in
the
old
days
i
have
heard
him
making
plans
which
prevent
me
from
being
astonished
at
his
impudence
now
so
i
have
but
little
fear
of
there
you
are
wrong
replied
the
abbe
you
should
always
fear
a
coward
because
he
strikes
from
behind
while
you
are
expecting
him
in
front
if
john
mauprat
were
not
a
trappist
if
the
papers
he
showed
me
were
lies
the
prior
of
the
carmelites
is
too
shrewd
and
cautious
to
have
let
himself
be
deceived
never
would
he
have
espoused
the
cause
of
a
layman
and
never
would
he
mistake
a
layman
for
one
of
his
own
cloth
however
we
must
make
inquiries
i
will
write
to
the
superior
of
the
trappist
monastery
at
once
but
i
am
certain
he
will
confirm
what
i
know
already
it
is
even
possible
that
john
mauprat
is
a
genuine
devotee
nothing
becomes
such
a
character
better
than
certain
shades
of
the
catholic
spirit
the
inquisition
is
the
soul
of
the
church
and
the
inquisition
should
smile
on
john
mauprat
i
firmly
believe
that
he
would
give
himself
up
to
the
sword
of
justice
solely
for
the
pleasure
of
compassing
your
ruin
with
his
own
and
that
the
desire
to
found
a
monastery
with
your
money
is
a
sudden
inspiration
the
honour
of
which
belongs
entirely
to
the
prior
of
the
carmelites
that
is
hardly
probable
my
dear
abbe
i
said
besides
where
can
these
discussions
lead
us
let
us
act
let
us
keep
the
chevalier
in
sight
so
that
the
unclean
beast
may
not
come
and
poison
the
calm
of
his
last
days
write
to
the
trappist
superior
i
will
offer
the
creature
a
pension
and
when
he
comes
let
us
carefully
watch
his
slightest
movements
my
sergeant
marcasse
is
an
admirable
bloodhound
let
us
put
him
on
the
track
and
if
he
can
manage
to
tell
us
in
vulgar
speech
what
he
has
seen
and
heard
we
shall
soon
know
everything
that
is
happening
in
the
chatting
thus
we
arrived
at
the
chateau
towards
the
close
of
day
as
i
entered
the
silent
building
i
was
seized
with
a
fond
childish
uneasiness
such
as
may
come
upon
a
mother
when
she
leaves
her
babe
a
moment
the
eternal
security
which
nothing
had
ever
disturbed
within
the
bounds
of
the
old
sacred
walls
the
decrepitude
of
the
servants
the
way
in
which
the
doors
always
stood
open
so
that
beggars
would
sometimes
enter
the
without
meeting
any
one
and
without
giving
umbrage
the
whole
atmosphere
of
peace
and
trust
and
isolation
formed
a
strange
contrast
to
the
thoughts
of
strife
and
the
cares
with
which
john
s
return
and
the
prior
s
threats
had
filled
my
mind
for
some
hours
i
quickened
my
pace
and
seized
with
an
involuntary
trembling
i
crossed
the
at
that
moment
i
thought
i
saw
a
dark
shadow
pass
under
the
windows
of
the
ground
floor
glide
through
the
jasmines
and
disappear
in
the
twilight
i
threw
open
the
door
of
the
and
stood
still
there
was
not
a
sound
not
a
movement
i
was
going
to
look
for
edmee
in
her
father
s
room
when
i
thought
i
saw
something
white
moving
near
the
where
the
chevalier
always
sat
edmee
is
that
you
i
exclaimed
no
one
answered
my
brow
was
covered
with
a
cold
sweat
and
my
knees
were
trembling
ashamed
of
this
strange
weakness
i
rushed
towards
the
hearth
repeating
edmee
s
name
in
agonized
tones
have
you
come
at
last
bernard
she
replied
in
a
trembling
voice
i
seized
her
in
my
arms
she
was
kneeling
beside
her
father
s
and
pressing
to
her
lips
the
old
man
s
icy
hands
great
god
i
cried
when
by
the
dim
light
in
the
room
i
could
distinguish
the
chevalier
s
livid
face
is
our
father
dead
perhaps
she
said
in
a
stifled
voice
perhaps
he
has
only
fainted
please
god
but
a
light
for
heaven
s
sake
ring
the
bell
he
has
only
been
in
this
state
for
a
i
rang
in
all
haste
the
abbe
now
came
in
and
fortunately
we
succeeded
in
bringing
my
uncle
back
to
life
but
when
he
opened
his
eyes
his
mind
seemed
to
be
struggling
against
the
impressions
of
a
fearful
dream
has
he
gone
has
the
vile
phantom
gone
he
repeated
several
times
ho
there
my
pistols
now
my
men
throw
the
fellow
out
of
the
window
i
began
to
suspect
the
truth
what
has
happened
i
said
the
edmee
in
a
low
tone
who
has
been
here
in
my
absence
if
i
told
you
answered
edmee
you
would
hardly
believe
it
you
would
think
my
father
and
i
were
mad
but
i
will
tell
you
everything
presently
let
us
attend
to
with
her
soft
words
and
loving
attentions
she
succeeded
in
calming
the
old
man
we
carried
him
to
his
room
and
he
fell
into
a
quiet
sleep
when
edmee
had
gently
withdrawn
her
hand
from
his
and
lowered
the
wadded
curtain
over
his
head
she
joined
the
abbe
and
myself
and
told
us
that
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
we
returned
a
mendicant
friar
had
entered
the
where
as
usual
she
was
embroidering
near
her
father
who
had
fallen
asleep
feeling
no
surprise
at
an
incident
which
frequently
happened
she
had
risen
to
get
her
purse
from
the
at
the
same
time
addressing
a
few
words
to
the
monk
but
just
as
she
was
turning
round
to
offer
him
an
alms
the
chevalier
had
awakened
with
a
start
and
eyeing
the
monk
from
head
to
foot
had
cried
in
a
tone
half
of
anger
and
half
of
fear
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
in
that
garb
thereupon
edmee
had
looked
at
the
monk
s
face
and
had
recognised
a
man
you
would
never
dream
of
she
said
the
frightful
john
mauprat
i
had
only
seen
him
a
single
hour
in
my
life
but
that
repulsive
face
has
never
left
my
memory
and
i
have
never
had
the
slightest
attack
of
fever
without
seeing
it
again
i
could
not
repress
a
cry
do
not
be
afraid
he
said
with
a
hideous
smile
i
come
here
not
as
an
enemy
but
as
a
and
he
went
down
on
his
knees
so
near
my
father
that
not
knowing
what
he
might
do
i
rushed
between
them
and
hastily
pushed
back
the
to
the
wall
then
the
monk
speaking
in
a
mournful
tone
which
was
rendered
still
more
terrifying
by
the
approach
of
night
began
to
pour
out
some
lamentable
rigmarole
of
a
confession
and
ended
by
asking
pardon
for
his
crimes
and
declaring
that
he
was
already
covered
by
the
black
veil
which
parricides
wear
when
they
go
to
the
scaffold
this
wretched
creature
has
gone
mad
said
my
father
pulling
the
but
is
deaf
and
he
did
not
come
so
we
had
to
sit
in
unspeakable
agony
and
listen
to
the
strange
talk
of
the
man
who
calls
himself
a
trappist
and
declares
that
he
had
come
to
give
himself
up
to
justice
in
expiation
of
his
transgressions
before
doing
so
he
wished
to
implore
my
father
s
forgiveness
and
his
last
blessing
while
saying
this
he
was
moving
forward
on
his
knees
and
speaking
with
an
intense
passion
in
the
sound
of
this
voice
uttering
words
of
extravagant
humility
there
seemed
to
be
insult
and
a
menace
as
he
continued
moving
nearer
to
my
father
and
as
the
idea
of
the
foul
caresses
which
he
apparently
wished
to
lavish
on
him
filled
me
with
disgust
i
ordered
him
in
a
somewhat
imperious
tone
to
rise
and
speak
becomingly
my
father
angrily
ordered
him
to
say
no
more
and
depart
and
as
at
this
moment
he
cried
no
you
must
let
me
clasp
your
knees
i
pushed
him
back
to
prevent
him
from
touching
my
father
i
shudder
to
think
that
my
glove
has
touched
that
unclean
gown
he
turned
towards
me
and
though
he
still
feigned
penitence
and
humility
i
could
see
rage
gleaming
in
his
eyes
my
father
made
a
violent
effort
to
get
up
and
in
fact
he
got
up
as
if
by
a
miracle
but
the
next
instant
he
fell
back
fainting
in
his
chair
then
steps
were
heard
in
the
and
the
monk
rushed
out
by
the
glass
door
with
the
speed
of
lightning
it
was
then
that
you
found
me
and
frozen
with
terror
at
the
feet
of
my
prostate
the
abominable
coward
has
lost
no
time
you
see
abbe
i
cried
his
aim
was
to
frighten
the
chevalier
and
edmee
and
he
has
succeeded
but
he
reckoned
without
me
and
i
swear
that
though
he
should
have
to
be
treated
in
the
fashion
if
he
ever
dares
to
come
here
again
that
is
enough
bernard
said
edmee
you
make
me
shudder
speak
seriously
and
tell
me
what
all
this
when
i
had
informed
her
of
what
had
happened
to
the
abbe
and
myself
she
blamed
us
for
not
warning
her
had
i
known
she
said
what
to
expect
i
should
not
have
been
frightened
and
i
could
have
taken
care
never
to
be
left
alone
in
the
house
with
my
father
and
who
is
hardly
more
active
now
however
i
am
no
longer
afraid
i
shall
be
on
my
guard
but
the
best
thing
bernard
dear
is
to
avoid
all
contact
with
this
loathsome
man
and
to
make
him
as
liberal
an
allowance
as
possible
to
get
rid
of
him
the
abbe
is
right
he
may
prove
formidable
he
knows
that
our
kinship
with
him
must
always
prevent
us
from
summoning
the
law
to
protect
us
against
his
persecutions
and
though
he
can
not
injure
us
as
seriously
as
he
flatters
himself
he
can
at
least
cause
us
a
thousand
annoyances
which
i
am
reluctant
to
face
throw
him
gold
and
let
him
take
himself
off
but
do
not
leave
me
again
bernard
you
see
you
have
become
absolutely
necessary
to
me
brood
no
more
over
the
wrong
you
pretend
to
have
done
i
pressed
her
hand
in
mine
and
vowed
never
to
leave
her
though
she
herself
should
order
me
until
this
trappist
had
freed
the
country
from
his
presence
the
abbe
undertook
the
negotiations
with
the
monastery
he
went
into
the
town
the
following
day
carrying
from
me
a
special
message
to
the
trappist
that
i
would
throw
him
out
of
the
window
if
he
ever
took
it
into
his
head
to
appear
at
again
at
the
same
time
i
proposed
to
supply
him
with
money
even
liberally
on
condition
that
he
would
immediately
withdraw
to
his
convent
or
to
any
other
secular
or
religious
retreat
he
might
choose
and
that
he
would
never
again
set
foot
in
berry
the
prior
received
the
abbe
with
all
the
signs
of
profound
contempt
and
holy
aversion
for
his
state
of
heresy
far
from
attempting
to
wheedle
him
like
myself
he
told
him
that
he
wished
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
business
that
he
washed
his
hands
of
it
and
that
he
would
confine
himself
to
conveying
the
decisions
on
both
sides
and
affording
a
refuge
to
brother
nepomucene
partly
out
of
christian
charity
and
partly
to
edify
his
monks
by
the
example
of
a
truly
devout
man
according
to
him
brother
nepomucene
would
be
the
second
of
that
name
placed
in
the
front
rank
of
the
heavenly
host
by
virtue
of
the
canons
of
the
church
the
next
day
the
abbe
was
summoned
to
the
convent
by
a
special
messenger
and
had
an
interview
with
the
trappist
to
his
great
surprise
he
found
that
the
enemy
had
changed
his
tactics
he
indignantly
refused
help
of
any
sort
declaring
that
his
vow
of
poverty
and
humility
would
not
allow
it
and
he
strongly
blamed
his
dear
host
the
prior
for
daring
to
suggest
without
his
consent
an
exchange
of
things
eternal
for
things
temporal
on
other
matters
he
refused
to
explain
his
views
and
took
refuge
in
ambiguous
and
bombastic
replies
god
would
inspire
him
he
said
and
at
the
approaching
festival
of
the
virgin
at
the
august
and
sublime
hour
of
holy
communion
he
expected
to
hear
the
voice
of
jesus
speaking
to
his
heart
and
announcing
the
line
of
conduct
he
ought
to
follow
the
abbe
was
afraid
of
betraying
uneasiness
if
he
insisted
on
probing
this
christian
mystery
so
he
returned
with
this
answer
which
was
least
of
all
calculated
to
reassure
me
he
did
not
appear
again
either
at
the
castle
or
in
the
neighbourhood
and
kept
himself
so
closely
shut
up
in
the
convent
that
few
people
ever
saw
his
face
however
it
soon
became
known
and
the
prior
was
most
active
in
spreading
the
news
that
john
mauprat
had
been
converted
to
the
most
zealous
and
exemplary
piety
and
was
now
staying
at
the
carmelite
convent
for
a
term
as
a
penitent
from
la
trappe
every
day
they
reported
some
fresh
virtuous
trait
some
new
act
of
austerity
of
this
holy
personage
devotees
with
a
thirst
for
the
marvellous
came
to
see
him
and
brought
him
a
thousand
little
presents
which
he
obstinately
refused
at
times
he
would
hide
so
well
that
people
said
he
had
returned
to
his
monastery
but
just
as
we
were
congratulating
ourselves
on
getting
rid
of
him
we
would
hear
that
he
had
recently
inflicted
some
terrible
mortifications
on
himself
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
or
else
that
he
had
gone
barefooted
on
a
pilgrimage
into
some
of
the
wildest
and
most
desolate
parts
of
varenne
people
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
could
work
miracles
if
the
prior
had
not
been
cured
of
his
gout
that
was
because
in
a
spirit
of
true
penitence
he
did
not
wish
to
be
cured
this
state
of
uncertainty
lasted
almost
two
months
xxi
these
days
passed
in
edmee
s
presence
were
for
me
days
of
delight
yet
of
suffering
to
see
her
at
all
hours
without
fear
of
being
indiscreet
since
she
herself
would
summon
me
to
her
side
to
read
to
her
talk
with
her
on
all
subjects
share
the
loving
attentions
she
bestowed
on
her
father
enter
into
half
her
life
exactly
as
if
we
had
been
brother
and
sister
this
was
great
happiness
no
doubt
but
it
was
a
dangerous
happiness
and
again
the
volcano
kindled
in
my
breast
a
few
confused
words
a
few
troubled
glances
betrayed
me
edmee
was
by
no
means
blind
but
she
was
impenetrable
her
dark
and
searching
eyes
fixed
on
me
as
on
her
father
with
the
solicitude
of
an
absorbing
affection
would
at
times
suddenly
grow
cold
just
as
the
violence
of
my
passion
was
ready
to
break
out
her
countenance
would
then
express
nothing
but
patient
curiosity
and
an
unswerving
resolve
to
read
to
the
bottom
of
my
soul
without
letting
me
see
even
the
surface
of
her
own
my
sufferings
though
acute
were
dear
to
me
at
first
it
pleased
me
to
think
that
i
was
secretly
offering
them
to
edmee
as
an
expiation
of
my
past
faults
i
hoped
that
she
would
perceive
this
and
be
satisfied
with
me
she
saw
it
and
said
nothing
my
agony
grew
more
intense
but
still
some
days
passed
before
i
lost
all
power
to
hide
it
i
say
days
because
whoever
has
loved
a
woman
and
has
been
much
alone
with
her
yet
always
kept
in
check
by
her
severity
must
have
found
days
like
centuries
how
full
life
seemed
and
yet
how
consuming
what
languor
and
unrest
what
tenderness
and
rage
it
was
as
though
the
hours
were
years
and
at
this
very
day
if
i
did
not
bring
in
dates
to
rectify
the
error
of
my
memory
i
could
easily
persuade
myself
that
these
two
months
filled
half
my
life
perhaps
too
i
should
like
to
persuade
myself
of
this
in
order
to
find
some
excuse
for
the
foolish
and
culpable
conduct
into
which
i
fell
in
spite
of
all
the
good
resolutions
which
i
had
but
lately
formed
the
relapse
was
so
sudden
and
complete
that
i
should
still
blush
at
the
thought
if
i
had
not
cruelly
atoned
for
it
as
you
will
soon
see
after
a
night
of
agony
i
wrote
her
an
insane
letter
which
came
nigh
to
producing
terrible
consequences
for
me
it
was
somewhat
as
follows
you
do
not
love
me
edmee
you
will
never
love
me
i
know
this
i
ask
for
nothing
i
hope
for
nothing
i
would
only
remain
near
you
and
consecrate
my
life
to
your
service
and
defence
to
be
useful
to
you
i
will
do
all
that
my
strength
will
allow
but
i
shall
suffer
and
however
i
try
to
hide
it
you
will
see
it
and
perhaps
you
will
attribute
to
wrong
causes
the
sadness
i
may
not
be
able
to
suppress
with
uniform
heroism
you
pained
me
deeply
yesterday
when
you
advised
me
to
go
out
a
little
to
distract
my
to
distract
my
thoughts
from
you
edmee
what
bitter
mockery
do
not
be
cruel
sister
for
then
you
become
my
haughty
betrothed
of
evil
days
again
and
in
spite
of
myself
i
again
become
the
brigand
whom
you
used
to
hate
ah
if
you
knew
how
unhappy
i
am
in
me
there
are
two
men
who
are
incessantly
waging
a
war
to
the
death
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
brigand
will
fall
but
he
defends
himself
step
by
step
and
he
cries
aloud
because
he
feels
himself
covered
with
wounds
and
mortally
stricken
if
you
knew
edmee
if
you
only
knew
what
struggles
what
conflicts
rend
my
bosom
what
tears
of
blood
my
heart
distils
and
what
passions
often
rage
in
that
part
of
my
nature
which
the
rebel
angels
rule
there
are
nights
when
i
suffer
so
much
that
in
the
delirium
of
my
dreams
i
seem
to
be
plunging
a
dagger
into
your
heart
and
thus
by
some
sombre
magic
to
be
forcing
you
to
love
me
as
i
love
you
when
i
awake
in
a
cold
sweat
bewildered
beside
myself
i
feel
tempted
to
go
and
kill
you
so
as
to
destroy
the
cause
of
my
anguish
if
i
refrain
from
this
it
is
because
i
fear
that
i
should
love
you
dead
with
as
much
passion
and
tenacity
as
if
you
were
alive
i
am
afraid
of
being
restrained
governed
swayed
by
your
image
as
i
am
by
your
person
then
again
a
man
can
not
destroy
the
being
he
loves
and
fears
for
when
she
has
ceased
to
exist
on
earth
she
still
exists
in
himself
it
is
the
lover
s
soul
which
serves
as
a
coffin
for
his
mistress
and
which
forever
preserves
her
burning
remains
that
it
may
feed
on
them
without
ever
consuming
them
but
great
heaven
what
is
this
tumult
in
my
thoughts
you
see
edmee
to
what
an
extent
my
mind
is
sick
take
pity
on
me
then
bear
with
me
let
me
be
sad
never
doubt
my
devotion
i
am
often
mad
but
i
worship
you
always
a
word
a
look
from
you
will
always
recall
me
to
a
sense
of
duty
and
this
duty
will
be
sweet
when
you
deign
to
remind
me
of
it
as
i
write
to
you
edmee
the
sky
is
full
of
clouds
that
are
darker
and
heavier
than
lead
the
thunder
is
rumbling
and
doleful
ghosts
of
purgatory
seem
to
be
floating
in
the
glare
of
the
lightning
the
weight
of
the
storm
lies
on
my
soul
my
bewildered
mind
quivers
like
the
flashes
which
leap
from
the
firmament
it
seems
as
if
my
whole
being
were
about
to
burst
like
the
tempest
ah
could
i
but
lift
up
to
you
a
voice
like
unto
its
voice
had
i
the
power
to
lay
bare
the
agonies
and
passions
which
rend
me
within
often
when
a
storm
has
been
sweeping
over
the
great
oaks
above
you
have
told
me
that
you
enjoy
gazing
upon
the
fury
of
the
one
and
the
resistance
of
the
other
this
you
say
is
a
battle
of
mighty
forces
and
in
the
din
in
the
air
you
fancy
you
can
detect
the
curses
of
the
north
wind
and
the
mournful
cries
of
the
venerable
branches
which
suffers
the
more
edmee
the
tree
which
resists
or
the
wind
which
exhausts
itself
in
the
attack
is
it
not
always
the
wind
that
yields
and
falls
and
then
the
sky
grieved
at
the
defeat
of
her
noble
son
sheds
a
flood
of
tears
upon
the
earth
you
love
these
wild
images
edmee
and
whenever
you
behold
strength
vanquished
by
resistance
you
smile
cruelly
and
there
is
a
look
in
your
inscrutable
eyes
that
seems
to
insult
my
misery
well
you
have
cast
me
to
the
ground
and
though
shattered
i
still
suffer
yes
learn
this
since
you
wish
to
know
it
since
you
are
merciless
enough
to
question
me
and
to
feign
compassion
i
suffer
and
i
no
longer
try
to
remove
the
foot
which
the
proud
conqueror
has
placed
on
my
broken
the
rest
of
this
letter
which
was
very
long
very
rambling
and
absurd
from
beginning
to
end
was
in
the
same
strain
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
i
had
written
to
edmee
though
i
lived
under
the
same
roof
and
never
left
her
except
during
the
hours
of
rest
my
passion
possessed
me
to
such
a
degree
that
i
was
irresistibly
drawn
to
encroach
upon
my
sleep
in
order
to
write
to
her
i
could
never
feel
that
i
had
talked
enough
about
her
that
i
had
sufficiently
renewed
my
promises
of
submission
a
submission
in
which
i
was
constantly
failing
the
present
letter
however
was
more
daring
and
more
passionate
than
any
of
the
others
perhaps
in
some
mysterious
way
it
was
written
under
the
influence
of
the
storm
which
was
rending
the
heavens
while
i
bent
over
my
table
with
moist
brow
and
dry
burning
hand
drew
this
frenzied
picture
of
my
sufferings
a
great
calm
akin
to
despair
seemed
to
come
over
me
as
i
threw
myself
upon
my
bed
after
going
down
to
the
and
slipping
my
letter
into
edmee
s
day
was
breaking
and
the
horizon
showed
heavy
with
the
dark
wings
of
the
storm
which
was
flying
to
other
regions
the
trees
laden
with
rain
were
tossing
under
the
breeze
which
was
still
blowing
freshly
profoundly
sad
but
blindly
resigned
to
my
suffering
i
fell
asleep
with
a
sense
of
relief
as
if
i
had
made
a
sacrifice
of
my
life
and
hopes
apparently
edmee
did
not
find
my
letter
for
she
gave
me
no
answer
she
generally
replied
verbally
and
these
letters
of
mine
were
a
means
of
drawing
from
her
those
professions
of
sisterly
friendship
with
which
i
had
perforce
to
be
satisfied
and
which
at
least
poured
soothing
balm
into
my
wound
i
ought
to
have
known
that
this
time
my
letter
must
either
lead
to
a
decisive
explanation
or
be
passed
over
in
silence
i
suspected
the
abbe
of
having
taken
it
and
thrown
it
into
the
fire
i
accused
edmee
of
scorn
and
cruelty
nevertheless
i
held
my
tongue
the
next
day
the
weather
was
quite
settled
again
my
uncle
went
for
a
drive
and
during
the
course
of
it
told
us
that
he
should
not
like
to
die
without
having
had
one
last
great
he
was
passionately
devoted
to
this
sport
and
his
health
had
so
far
improved
that
he
again
began
to
show
a
slight
inclination
for
pleasure
and
exercise
seated
in
a
very
light
narrow
drawn
by
strong
mules
so
that
he
might
move
rapidly
over
the
sandy
paths
in
our
woods
he
had
already
followed
one
or
two
little
hunts
which
we
had
arranged
for
his
amusement
since
the
trappist
s
visit
the
chevalier
had
entered
as
it
were
upon
a
fresh
term
of
life
endowed
with
strength
and
pertinacity
like
all
his
race
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
been
decaying
for
want
of
excitement
for
the
slightest
demand
on
his
energy
immediately
set
his
stagnant
blood
in
motion
as
he
was
very
much
pleased
with
this
idea
of
a
hunt
edmee
undertook
to
organize
with
my
help
a
general
battue
and
to
join
in
the
sport
herself
one
of
the
greatest
delights
of
the
good
old
man
was
to
see
her
on
horseback
as
she
boldly
pranced
around
his
carriage
and
offered
him
all
the
flowering
sprigs
which
she
plucked
from
the
bushes
she
passed
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
ride
with
her
and
that
the
abbe
should
accompany
the
chevalier
in
the
carriage
all
the
gamekeepers
foresters
huntsmen
and
even
poachers
of
varenne
were
invited
to
this
family
function
a
splendid
meal
was
prepared
with
many
and
much
local
wine
marcasse
whom
i
had
made
my
manager
at
and
who
had
a
considerable
knowledge
of
the
art
of
spent
two
whole
days
in
stopping
up
the
earths
a
few
young
farmers
in
the
neighbourhood
interested
in
the
battue
and
able
to
give
useful
advice
graciously
offered
to
join
the
party
and
last
of
all
patience
in
spite
of
his
aversion
for
the
destruction
of
innocent
animals
consented
to
follow
the
hunt
as
a
spectator
on
the
appointed
day
which
opened
warm
and
cloudless
on
our
happy
plans
and
my
own
implacable
destiny
some
fifty
individuals
met
with
horns
horses
and
hounds
at
the
end
we
were
to
play
havoc
with
the
rabbits
of
which
there
were
too
many
on
the
estate
it
would
be
easy
to
destroy
them
wholesale
by
falling
back
upon
that
part
of
the
forest
which
had
not
been
beaten
during
the
hunt
each
man
therefore
armed
himself
with
a
carbine
and
my
uncle
also
took
one
to
shoot
from
his
carriage
which
he
could
still
do
with
much
skill
edmee
was
mounted
on
a
very
spirited
limousin
mare
which
she
amused
herself
by
exciting
and
quieting
with
a
touching
coquetry
to
please
her
old
father
for
the
first
two
hours
she
hardly
left
the
carriage
at
all
and
the
chevalier
now
full
of
new
life
gazed
on
her
with
smiles
and
tears
of
love
just
as
in
the
daily
rotation
of
our
globe
ere
passing
into
night
we
take
leave
of
the
radiant
orb
which
is
going
to
reign
over
another
hemisphere
even
so
did
the
old
man
find
some
consolation
for
his
death
in
the
thought
that
the
youth
and
vigour
and
beauty
of
his
daughter
were
surviving
him
for
another
generation
when
the
hunt
was
in
full
swing
edmee
who
certainly
inherited
some
of
the
martial
spirit
of
the
family
and
the
calmness
of
whose
soul
could
not
always
restrain
the
impetuosity
of
her
blood
yielded
to
her
father
s
repeated
signs
for
his
great
desire
now
was
to
see
her
gallop
and
went
after
the
field
which
was
already
a
little
distance
ahead
follow
her
follow
her
cried
the
chevalier
who
had
no
sooner
seen
her
galloping
off
than
his
fond
paternal
vanity
had
given
place
to
uneasiness
i
did
not
need
to
be
told
twice
and
digging
my
spurs
into
my
horse
s
flanks
i
rejoined
edmee
in
a
which
she
had
taken
to
come
up
with
the
hunt
i
shuddered
as
i
saw
her
bending
like
a
reed
under
the
branches
while
her
horse
which
she
was
still
urging
on
carried
her
between
the
trees
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
for
god
s
sake
edmee
i
cried
do
not
ride
so
fast
you
will
be
killed
let
me
have
a
gallop
she
said
gaily
my
father
has
allowed
me
you
must
not
interfere
i
shall
rap
you
on
the
knuckles
if
you
try
to
stop
my
at
least
let
me
follow
you
then
i
said
keeping
close
to
her
your
father
wished
it
and
i
shall
at
least
be
there
to
kill
myself
if
anything
happens
to
why
i
was
filled
with
these
gloomy
forebodings
i
do
not
know
for
i
had
often
seen
edmee
galloping
through
the
woods
i
was
in
a
peculiar
state
the
heat
of
noon
seemed
mounting
to
my
brain
and
my
nerves
were
strangely
excited
i
had
eaten
no
breakfast
as
i
had
felt
somewhat
out
of
sorts
in
the
morning
and
to
sustain
myself
had
swallowed
several
cups
of
coffee
mixed
with
rum
at
first
i
experienced
a
horrible
sense
of
fear
then
after
a
few
minutes
the
fear
gave
way
to
an
inexpressible
feeling
of
love
and
delight
the
excitement
of
the
gallop
became
so
intense
that
i
imagined
my
only
object
was
to
pursue
edmee
to
see
her
flying
before
me
as
light
as
her
own
black
mare
whose
feet
were
speeding
noiselessly
over
the
moss
one
might
have
taken
her
for
a
fairy
who
had
suddenly
appeared
in
this
lonely
spot
to
disturb
the
mind
of
man
and
lure
him
away
to
her
treacherous
haunts
i
forgot
the
hunt
and
everything
else
i
saw
nothing
but
edmee
then
a
mist
fell
upon
my
eyes
and
i
could
see
her
no
more
still
i
galloped
on
i
was
in
a
state
of
silent
frenzy
when
she
suddenly
stopped
what
are
we
doing
she
said
i
can
not
hear
the
hunt
any
longer
and
here
is
the
river
in
front
we
have
come
too
far
to
the
no
no
edmee
i
answered
without
knowing
in
the
least
what
i
was
saying
another
gallop
and
we
shall
be
how
red
you
are
she
said
but
how
shall
we
cross
the
river
since
there
is
a
road
there
must
be
a
ford
i
replied
come
on
come
on
i
was
filled
with
an
insane
desire
to
go
on
galloping
i
believe
my
idea
was
to
plunge
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest
with
her
but
this
idea
was
wrapped
in
a
haze
and
when
i
tried
to
pierce
it
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
wild
throbbing
of
my
breast
and
temples
edmee
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
these
woods
are
accursed
she
said
i
am
always
losing
my
way
in
no
doubt
she
was
thinking
of
the
fatal
day
when
she
had
been
carried
far
from
another
hunt
and
brought
to
i
thought
of
it
too
and
the
ideas
that
came
into
my
mind
produced
a
sort
of
dizziness
i
followed
her
mechanically
towards
the
river
suddenly
i
realized
that
she
was
on
the
other
bank
i
was
filled
with
rage
on
seeing
that
her
horse
was
cleverer
and
braver
than
my
own
before
i
could
get
the
animal
to
take
the
ford
which
was
rather
a
nasty
one
edmee
was
a
long
way
ahead
of
me
again
i
dug
my
spurs
into
its
sides
till
the
blood
streamed
from
them
at
last
after
being
nearly
thrown
several
times
i
reached
the
other
bank
and
blind
with
rage
started
in
pursuit
of
edmee
i
overtook
her
and
seizing
the
mare
s
bridle
i
exclaimed
stop
edmee
i
say
you
shall
not
go
any
at
the
same
time
i
shook
the
reins
so
violently
that
her
horse
reared
she
lost
her
balance
and
to
avoid
falling
jumped
lightly
to
the
ground
between
our
two
animals
at
the
risk
of
being
hurt
i
was
on
the
ground
almost
as
soon
as
herself
i
at
once
pushed
the
horses
away
edmee
s
which
was
very
quiet
stopped
and
began
to
browse
mine
bolted
out
of
sight
all
this
was
the
affair
of
an
instant
i
had
caught
edmee
in
my
arms
she
freed
herself
and
said
in
a
sharp
tone
you
are
very
brutal
bernard
and
i
hate
these
ways
of
yours
what
is
the
matter
with
you
perplexed
and
confused
i
told
her
that
i
thought
her
mare
was
bolting
and
that
i
was
afraid
some
accident
might
happen
to
her
if
she
allowed
herself
to
be
carried
away
by
the
excitement
of
the
ride
and
to
save
me
she
replied
you
make
me
fall
at
the
risk
of
killing
me
really
that
was
most
considerate
of
let
me
help
you
to
mount
again
i
said
and
without
waiting
for
her
permission
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
lifted
her
off
the
ground
you
know
very
well
that
i
do
not
mount
in
this
way
she
exclaimed
now
quite
irritated
leave
me
alone
i
don
t
want
your
but
i
was
no
longer
in
a
state
to
obey
her
i
was
losing
my
head
my
arms
were
tightening
around
her
waist
and
it
was
in
vain
that
i
endeavoured
to
take
them
away
my
lips
touched
her
bosom
in
spite
of
myself
she
grew
pale
with
anger
oh
how
unfortunate
i
am
i
said
with
my
eyes
full
of
tears
how
unfortunate
i
am
to
be
always
offending
you
and
to
be
hated
more
and
more
in
proportion
as
my
love
for
you
grows
greater
edmee
was
of
an
imperious
and
violent
nature
her
character
hardened
by
trials
had
every
year
developed
greater
strength
she
was
no
longer
the
trembling
girl
making
a
parade
of
courage
but
in
reality
more
ingenuous
than
bold
whom
i
had
clasped
in
my
arms
at
she
was
now
a
proud
fearless
woman
who
would
have
let
herself
be
killed
rather
than
give
the
slightest
countenance
to
an
audacious
hope
besides
she
was
now
the
woman
who
knows
that
she
is
passionately
loved
and
is
conscious
of
her
power
she
repulsed
me
therefore
with
scorn
and
as
i
followed
her
distractedly
she
raised
her
whip
and
threatened
to
leave
a
mark
of
ignominy
on
my
face
if
i
dared
to
touch
even
her
stirrup
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
begged
her
not
to
leave
me
thus
without
forgiving
me
she
was
already
in
her
saddle
and
as
she
looked
round
for
the
way
back
she
exclaimed
that
was
the
one
thing
wanting
to
behold
this
hateful
spot
again
do
you
see
where
we
are
i
looked
in
my
turn
and
saw
that
we
were
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
quite
close
to
the
shady
little
pond
at
gazeau
a
few
yards
from
us
through
the
trees
which
had
grown
denser
since
patience
left
i
perceived
the
door
of
the
tower
opening
like
a
big
black
mouth
behind
the
green
foliage
i
was
seized
with
a
fresh
dizziness
a
terrible
struggle
was
taking
place
between
two
instincts
who
shall
explain
the
mysterious
workings
of
man
s
brain
when
his
soul
is
grappling
with
the
senses
and
one
part
of
his
being
is
striving
to
strangle
the
other
in
an
organization
like
mine
such
a
conflict
believe
me
was
bound
to
be
terrible
and
do
not
imagine
that
the
will
makes
but
a
feeble
resistance
in
natures
carried
away
by
passion
it
is
idiotic
to
say
to
a
man
who
lies
spent
with
such
struggles
you
ought
to
have
conquered
xxii
how
shall
i
describe
to
you
what
i
felt
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
gazeau
tower
i
had
seen
it
but
twice
in
my
life
each
time
i
had
taken
part
in
a
painfully
stirring
scene
there
yet
these
scenes
were
as
naught
beside
the
one
awaiting
me
on
this
third
encounter
there
must
be
a
curse
on
certain
places
i
fancied
i
could
still
see
the
blood
of
the
two
mauprats
sprinkled
on
the
shattered
door
their
life
of
crime
and
their
tragic
end
made
me
shudder
at
the
violent
instincts
which
i
felt
in
myself
i
was
filled
with
a
horror
of
my
own
feelings
and
i
understood
why
edmee
did
not
love
me
but
as
if
yonder
deplorable
blood
had
power
to
stir
a
fatal
sympathy
i
felt
the
wild
strength
of
my
passion
increasing
in
proportion
as
my
will
made
greater
efforts
to
subdue
it
i
had
trampled
down
all
other
passions
scarcely
a
trace
of
them
remained
in
me
i
was
sober
if
not
gentle
and
patient
i
was
at
least
capable
of
affection
and
sympathy
i
had
a
profound
sense
of
the
laws
of
honour
and
the
highest
respect
for
the
dignity
of
others
love
however
was
still
the
most
formidable
of
my
enemies
for
it
was
inseparably
connected
with
all
that
i
had
acquired
of
morality
and
delicacy
it
was
the
tie
that
bound
the
old
man
to
the
new
an
indissoluble
tie
which
made
it
almost
impossible
for
me
to
find
the
golden
mean
between
reason
and
passion
standing
before
edmee
who
was
about
to
leave
me
behind
and
on
foot
furious
at
seeing
her
escape
me
for
the
last
time
since
after
the
insult
i
had
just
offered
her
she
would
doubtless
never
run
the
risk
of
being
alone
with
me
again
i
gazed
on
her
with
a
terrible
expression
i
was
livid
my
fists
were
clinched
i
had
but
to
resolve
and
the
slightest
exertion
of
my
strength
would
have
snatched
her
from
her
horse
thrown
her
to
the
ground
and
left
her
at
the
mercy
of
my
desires
i
had
but
to
let
my
old
savage
instincts
reign
for
a
second
and
i
could
have
slaked
extinguished
the
fires
which
had
been
consuming
me
for
seven
years
never
did
edmee
know
the
danger
her
honour
ran
in
that
minute
of
agony
and
never
have
i
ceased
to
feel
remorse
for
it
but
god
alone
shall
be
my
judge
for
i
triumphed
and
this
was
the
last
evil
thought
of
my
life
in
this
thought
moreover
lay
the
whole
of
my
crime
the
rest
was
the
work
of
fate
filled
with
fear
i
suddenly
turned
my
back
on
her
and
wringing
my
hands
in
despair
hastened
away
by
the
path
which
had
brought
me
thither
i
cared
little
where
i
went
i
only
knew
that
i
had
to
tear
myself
away
from
perilous
temptations
it
was
a
broiling
day
the
odour
of
the
woods
seemed
intoxicating
the
mere
sight
of
them
was
stirring
up
the
instincts
of
my
old
savage
life
i
had
to
flee
or
fall
with
an
imperious
gesture
edmee
ordered
me
to
depart
from
her
presence
the
idea
that
any
danger
could
possibly
threaten
her
except
from
myself
naturally
did
not
come
into
my
head
or
her
own
i
plunged
into
the
forest
i
had
not
gone
more
than
thirty
paces
when
i
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
from
the
spot
where
i
had
left
edmee
i
stopped
petrified
with
horror
why
i
know
not
for
in
the
middle
of
a
battue
the
report
of
a
gun
was
by
no
means
extraordinary
but
my
soul
was
so
sorrowful
that
it
seemed
ready
to
find
fresh
woe
in
everything
i
was
about
to
retrace
my
steps
and
rejoin
edmee
at
the
risk
of
offending
her
still
more
when
i
thought
i
heard
the
moaning
of
a
human
being
in
the
direction
of
gazeau
tower
i
rushed
forward
and
then
fell
upon
my
knees
as
if
stunned
by
emotion
it
took
me
some
minutes
to
recover
my
brain
seemed
full
of
doleful
sights
and
sounds
i
could
no
longer
distinguish
between
illusion
and
reality
though
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
i
began
to
grope
my
way
among
the
trees
all
of
a
sudden
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
the
abbe
he
was
anxiously
looking
for
edmee
the
chevalier
had
driven
to
a
certain
spot
to
watch
the
field
pass
and
not
seeing
his
daughter
had
been
filled
with
apprehension
the
abbe
had
plunged
into
the
forest
at
once
and
soon
finding
the
tracks
of
our
horses
had
come
to
see
what
had
happened
to
us
he
had
heard
the
gun
but
had
thought
nothing
of
it
seeing
me
pale
and
apparently
dazed
with
my
hair
disarranged
and
without
either
horse
or
gun
i
had
let
mine
fall
on
the
spot
where
i
had
half
fainted
and
had
not
thought
of
picking
it
up
he
was
as
terrified
as
myself
nor
did
he
know
any
more
than
i
for
what
reason
edmee
he
said
to
me
where
is
edmee
i
made
a
rambling
reply
he
was
so
alarmed
at
seeing
me
in
such
a
state
that
he
felt
secretly
convinced
i
had
committed
some
crime
as
he
subsequently
confessed
to
me
wretched
boy
he
said
shaking
me
vigorously
by
the
arm
to
bring
me
to
my
senses
be
calm
collect
your
thoughts
i
implore
you
i
did
not
understand
a
word
but
i
led
him
towards
the
fatal
spot
and
there
a
sight
never
to
be
forgotten
edmee
was
lying
on
the
ground
rigid
and
bathed
in
blood
her
mare
was
quietly
grazing
a
few
yards
away
patience
was
standing
by
her
side
with
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
his
face
livid
and
his
heart
so
full
that
he
was
unable
to
answer
a
word
to
the
abbe
s
cries
and
sobs
for
myself
i
could
not
understand
what
was
taking
place
i
fancy
that
my
brain
already
bewildered
by
my
previous
emotions
must
have
been
completely
paralyzed
i
sat
down
on
the
ground
by
edmee
s
side
she
had
been
shot
in
the
breast
in
two
places
i
gazed
on
her
lifeless
eyes
in
a
state
of
absolute
stupor
take
away
that
creature
said
patience
to
the
abbe
casting
a
look
of
contempt
on
me
his
perverse
nature
is
what
it
always
edmee
edmee
cried
the
abbe
throwing
himself
upon
the
grass
and
endeavouring
to
stanch
the
blood
with
his
handkerchief
dead
dead
said
patience
and
there
is
the
murderer
she
said
so
as
she
gave
up
her
pure
soul
to
god
and
patience
will
avenge
her
it
is
very
hard
but
it
must
be
so
it
is
god
s
will
since
i
alone
was
here
to
learn
the
horrible
horrible
exclaimed
the
abbe
i
heard
the
sound
of
this
last
word
and
with
a
smile
i
repeated
it
like
an
echo
some
huntsmen
now
appeared
edmee
was
carried
away
i
believe
that
i
caught
sight
of
her
father
walking
without
help
however
i
should
not
dare
to
affirm
that
this
was
not
a
mere
extravagant
vision
for
i
had
no
definite
consciousness
of
anything
and
these
awful
moments
have
left
in
my
mind
nothing
but
vague
memories
as
of
a
dream
had
i
not
been
assured
that
the
chevalier
got
out
of
the
carriage
without
any
help
walked
about
and
acted
with
as
much
presence
of
mind
as
a
young
man
on
the
following
day
he
fell
into
a
state
of
absolute
dotage
and
insensibility
and
never
rose
from
his
again
but
what
happened
to
myself
i
do
not
know
when
i
recovered
my
reason
i
found
that
i
was
in
another
part
of
the
forest
near
a
little
waterfall
to
the
murmur
of
which
i
was
listening
mechanically
with
a
sort
of
vague
delight
blaireau
was
asleep
at
my
feet
while
his
master
leaning
against
a
tree
was
watching
me
attentively
the
setting
sun
was
sending
shafts
of
ruddy
gold
between
the
slender
stems
of
the
young
the
wild
flowers
seemed
to
be
smiling
at
me
and
birds
were
warbling
sweet
melodies
it
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
days
of
the
year
what
a
gorgeous
evening
i
said
to
marcasse
this
spot
is
as
beautiful
as
an
american
forest
well
old
friend
what
are
you
doing
there
you
ought
to
have
awakened
me
sooner
i
have
had
such
hideous
marcasse
came
and
knelt
down
beside
me
two
streams
of
tears
were
running
down
his
withered
sallow
cheeks
on
his
face
usually
so
impassive
there
was
an
ineffable
expression
of
pity
and
sorrow
and
affection
poor
master
he
said
delirium
head
bad
that
s
all
great
misfortune
but
fidelity
not
changed
always
with
you
if
need
be
ready
to
die
with
his
tears
and
words
filled
me
with
sadness
but
this
was
owing
to
an
instinctive
sympathy
enhanced
by
the
weak
state
of
my
nerves
for
i
did
not
remember
a
thing
i
threw
myself
into
his
arms
and
wept
like
himself
he
pressed
me
to
his
bosom
as
a
father
might
his
son
i
was
fully
conscious
that
some
frightful
misfortune
had
overtaken
me
but
i
was
afraid
to
learn
what
it
was
and
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
induced
me
to
ask
him
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
through
the
forest
i
let
myself
be
taken
like
a
child
then
a
fresh
sense
of
weariness
came
over
me
and
he
was
obliged
to
let
me
sit
down
again
for
half
an
hour
at
last
he
lifted
me
up
and
succeeded
in
leading
me
to
where
we
arrived
very
late
i
do
not
know
what
happened
to
me
during
the
night
marcasse
told
me
subsequently
that
i
had
been
very
delirious
he
took
upon
himself
to
send
to
the
nearest
village
for
a
barber
who
bled
me
early
in
the
morning
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
recovered
my
reason
but
what
a
frightful
service
they
seemed
to
have
done
me
dead
dead
dead
this
was
the
only
word
i
could
utter
i
did
nothing
but
groan
and
toss
about
on
my
bed
i
wanted
to
get
up
and
run
to
my
poor
sergeant
would
throw
himself
at
my
feet
or
plant
himself
in
front
of
the
door
to
prevent
me
to
keep
me
back
he
would
tell
me
various
things
which
i
did
not
in
the
least
understand
however
his
manifest
solicitude
for
me
and
my
own
feeling
of
exhaustion
made
me
yield
though
i
could
not
explain
his
conduct
in
one
of
these
struggles
my
vein
opened
again
and
i
returned
to
bed
before
marcasse
noticed
it
gradually
i
sank
into
a
deep
swoon
and
i
was
almost
dead
when
seeing
my
blue
lips
and
purple
cheeks
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
lift
up
the
and
found
me
lying
in
a
pool
of
blood
however
this
was
the
most
fortunate
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
me
for
several
days
i
remained
in
a
state
of
prostration
in
which
there
was
but
little
difference
between
my
waking
and
sleeping
hours
thanks
to
this
i
understood
nothing
and
therefore
did
not
suffer
one
morning
having
managed
to
make
me
take
a
little
nourishment
and
noticing
that
with
my
strength
my
melancholy
and
anxiety
were
returning
marcasse
announced
with
a
simple
genuine
delight
that
edmee
was
not
dead
and
that
they
did
not
despair
of
saving
her
these
words
fell
upon
me
like
a
thunderbolt
for
i
was
still
under
the
impression
that
this
frightful
adventure
was
a
delusion
of
my
delirium
i
began
to
shout
and
to
brandish
my
arms
in
a
terrible
manner
marcasse
fell
on
his
knees
by
my
bed
and
implored
me
to
be
calm
and
a
score
of
times
he
repeated
the
following
words
which
to
me
were
like
the
meaningless
words
one
hears
in
dreams
you
did
not
do
it
on
purpose
i
know
well
enough
no
you
did
not
do
it
on
purpose
it
was
an
accident
a
gun
going
off
in
your
hand
by
come
now
what
do
you
mean
i
exclaimed
impatiently
what
gun
what
accident
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
don
t
you
know
then
sir
how
she
was
hit
i
passed
my
hands
over
my
brow
as
if
to
bring
back
to
my
mind
the
energy
of
life
and
as
i
had
no
clear
recollection
of
the
mysterious
event
which
had
unhinged
it
i
thought
that
i
was
mad
and
remained
silent
and
dismayed
fearful
lest
any
word
should
escape
to
betray
the
loss
of
my
faculties
at
last
little
by
little
i
collected
my
thoughts
i
asked
for
some
wine
as
i
felt
weak
and
no
sooner
had
i
drunk
a
few
drops
than
all
the
scenes
of
the
fatal
day
unrolled
themselves
before
me
as
if
by
magic
i
even
remembered
the
words
that
i
had
heard
patience
utter
immediately
after
the
event
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
graven
in
that
part
of
the
memory
which
preserves
the
sound
of
words
even
when
the
other
part
which
treasures
up
their
sense
is
asleep
for
one
more
moment
i
was
uncertain
i
wondered
if
my
gun
could
have
gone
off
in
my
hands
just
as
i
was
leaving
edmee
i
distinctly
remembered
firing
it
at
a
pewit
an
hour
before
for
edmee
had
wanted
to
examine
the
bird
s
plumage
further
when
i
heard
the
shot
which
had
hit
her
my
gun
was
in
my
hands
and
i
had
not
thrown
it
down
until
a
few
seconds
later
so
it
could
not
have
been
this
weapon
which
had
gone
off
on
falling
besides
even
granting
a
fatality
which
was
incredible
i
was
much
too
far
from
edmee
at
that
moment
to
have
shot
her
finally
i
had
not
a
single
bullet
on
me
throughout
the
day
and
it
was
impossible
for
my
gun
to
have
been
loaded
unknown
to
myself
since
i
had
not
unslung
it
after
killing
the
pewit
quite
convinced
therefore
that
i
was
not
the
cause
of
the
hideous
accident
it
remained
to
me
to
find
an
explanation
of
this
crushing
catastrophe
to
me
it
was
perfectly
simple
some
booby
with
a
gun
i
thought
must
have
caught
sight
of
edmee
s
horse
through
the
branches
and
mistaken
it
for
a
wild
beast
and
i
did
not
dream
of
accusing
any
one
of
a
deliberate
attempt
at
murder
i
discovered
however
that
i
was
accused
myself
i
drew
the
truth
from
marcasse
he
informed
me
that
the
chevalier
and
all
the
people
who
took
part
in
the
hunt
had
attributed
the
misfortune
to
a
pure
accident
their
opinion
being
that
to
my
great
sorrow
my
gun
had
gone
off
when
my
horse
threw
me
for
it
was
believed
that
i
had
been
thrown
this
was
practically
the
view
they
all
took
in
the
few
words
that
edmee
had
been
able
to
utter
she
seemed
to
confirm
the
supposition
only
one
person
accused
me
and
that
was
patience
but
he
had
accused
me
before
none
but
his
two
friends
marcasse
and
the
abbe
aubert
and
then
only
after
pledging
them
to
secrecy
there
is
no
need
added
marcasse
for
me
to
tell
you
that
the
abbe
maintains
an
absolute
silence
and
refuses
to
believe
that
you
are
guilty
as
for
myself
i
swear
to
you
that
i
shall
never
stop
stop
i
said
do
not
tell
me
even
that
it
would
imply
that
some
one
in
the
world
might
actually
believe
it
but
edmee
said
something
extraordinary
to
patience
just
as
she
was
dying
for
she
is
dead
it
is
useless
for
you
to
try
to
deceive
me
she
is
dead
and
i
shall
never
see
her
she
is
not
dead
cried
marcasse
and
his
solemn
oaths
convinced
me
for
i
knew
that
he
would
have
tried
in
vain
to
lie
his
simple
soul
would
have
risen
in
revolt
against
his
charitable
intentions
as
for
edmee
s
words
he
frankly
refused
to
repeat
them
from
which
i
gathered
that
their
testimony
seemed
overwhelming
thereupon
i
dragged
myself
out
of
bed
and
stubbornly
resisted
all
marcasse
s
efforts
to
keep
me
back
i
had
the
farmer
s
horse
saddled
and
started
off
at
a
gallop
i
staggered
into
the
without
meeting
any
one
except
who
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
on
seeing
me
and
rushed
off
without
answering
my
questions
the
was
empty
edmee
s
embroidery
frame
buried
under
the
green
cloth
which
her
hand
perchance
would
never
lift
again
seemed
to
me
like
a
bier
under
its
pall
my
uncle
s
big
was
no
longer
in
the
my
portrait
which
i
had
had
painted
in
philadelphia
and
had
sent
over
during
the
american
war
had
been
taken
down
from
the
wall
these
were
signs
of
death
and
malediction
i
left
this
room
with
all
haste
and
went
upstairs
with
the
courage
of
innocence
but
with
despair
in
my
soul
i
waled
straight
to
edmee
s
room
knocked
and
entered
at
once
mademoiselle
leblanc
was
coming
towards
the
door
she
gave
a
loud
scream
and
ran
away
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
as
if
she
had
seen
a
wild
beast
who
then
could
have
been
spreading
hideous
reports
about
me
had
the
abbe
been
disloyal
enough
to
do
so
i
learnt
later
that
edmee
though
generous
and
unshaken
in
her
lucid
moments
had
openly
accused
me
in
her
delirium
i
approached
her
bed
and
half
delirious
myself
forgetting
that
my
sudden
appearance
might
be
a
deathblow
to
her
i
pulled
the
curtains
aside
with
an
eager
hand
and
gazed
on
her
never
have
i
seen
more
marvellous
beauty
her
big
dark
eyes
had
grown
half
as
large
again
they
were
shining
with
an
extraordinary
brilliancy
though
without
any
expression
like
diamonds
her
drawn
colourless
cheeks
and
her
lips
as
white
as
her
cheeks
gave
her
the
appearance
of
a
beautiful
marble
head
she
looked
at
me
fixedly
with
as
little
emotion
as
if
she
had
been
looking
at
a
picture
or
a
piece
of
furniture
then
turning
her
face
slightly
towards
the
wall
she
said
with
a
mysterious
smile
this
is
the
flower
they
call
i
fell
upon
my
knees
i
took
her
hand
i
covered
it
with
kisses
i
broke
into
sobs
but
she
gave
no
heed
her
hand
remained
in
mine
icy
and
still
like
a
piece
of
alabaster
xxiii
the
abbe
came
in
and
greeted
me
in
a
cold
and
sombre
manner
then
he
made
a
sign
to
me
and
drawing
me
away
from
the
bed
said
you
must
be
mad
return
at
once
and
if
you
are
wise
you
will
remain
away
it
is
the
only
thing
left
for
you
to
and
since
when
i
cried
flying
into
a
passion
have
you
had
the
right
to
drive
me
out
of
the
bosom
of
my
family
alas
you
have
no
longer
a
family
he
answered
with
an
accent
of
sorrow
that
somewhat
disarmed
me
what
were
once
father
and
daughter
are
now
naught
but
two
phantoms
whose
souls
are
already
dead
and
whose
bodies
soon
will
be
show
some
respect
for
the
last
days
of
those
who
loved
and
how
can
i
show
my
respect
and
grief
by
quitting
them
i
replied
quite
crushed
on
this
point
said
the
abbe
i
neither
wish
nor
ought
to
say
anything
for
you
know
that
your
presence
here
is
an
act
of
rashness
and
a
profanation
go
away
when
they
are
no
more
and
the
day
can
not
be
far
distant
if
you
have
any
claims
to
this
house
you
may
return
and
you
will
certainly
not
find
me
here
to
contest
them
or
affirm
them
meanwhile
as
i
have
no
knowledge
of
these
claims
i
believe
i
may
take
upon
myself
to
see
that
some
respect
is
paid
to
the
last
hours
of
these
two
holy
wretched
man
i
said
i
do
not
know
what
prevents
me
from
tearing
you
to
pieces
what
abominable
impulse
urges
you
to
be
everlastingly
turning
the
dagger
in
my
breast
are
you
afraid
that
i
may
survive
this
blow
can
not
you
see
that
three
coffins
will
be
taken
out
together
from
this
house
do
you
imagine
that
i
have
come
here
for
aught
but
a
farewell
look
and
a
farewell
blessing
you
might
say
a
farewell
pardon
replied
the
abbe
in
a
bitter
tone
and
with
a
gesture
of
merciless
condemnation
what
i
say
is
that
you
are
mad
i
cried
and
that
if
you
were
not
a
priest
this
hand
of
mine
should
crush
the
life
out
of
you
for
daring
to
speak
to
me
in
this
i
have
but
little
fear
of
you
sir
he
rejoined
to
take
my
life
would
be
doing
me
a
great
service
but
i
am
sorry
that
your
threats
and
anger
should
lend
weight
to
the
charges
under
which
you
lie
if
i
saw
that
you
were
moved
to
penitence
i
would
weep
with
you
but
your
assurance
fills
me
with
loathing
hitherto
i
had
seen
in
you
nothing
worse
than
a
raging
lunatic
i
seem
to
see
a
scoundrel
begone
sir
i
fell
into
an
choking
with
rage
and
anguish
for
a
moment
i
hoped
that
i
was
about
to
die
edmee
was
dying
by
my
side
and
before
me
was
a
judge
so
firmly
convinced
of
my
guilt
that
his
usual
gentle
timid
nature
had
become
harsh
and
pitiless
the
imminent
loss
of
her
i
loved
was
hurrying
me
into
a
longing
for
death
yet
the
horrible
charge
hanging
over
me
began
to
rouse
my
energies
i
did
not
believe
that
such
an
accusation
could
stand
for
a
single
instant
against
the
voice
of
truth
i
imagined
that
one
word
from
me
one
look
would
be
sufficient
to
make
it
fall
to
the
ground
but
i
felt
so
dazed
so
deeply
wounded
that
this
means
of
defence
was
denied
me
the
more
grievously
the
disgrace
of
such
a
suspicion
weighed
upon
my
mind
the
more
clearly
i
realized
that
it
is
almost
impossible
for
a
man
to
defend
himself
successfully
when
his
only
weapon
is
the
pride
of
slandered
innocence
i
sat
there
overwhelmed
unable
to
utter
a
word
it
seemed
as
if
a
dome
of
lead
were
weighing
on
my
skull
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
mademoiselle
leblanc
approached
me
stiffly
in
a
tone
full
of
hatred
she
informed
me
that
some
one
outside
wished
to
speak
to
me
i
went
out
mechanically
and
found
patience
waiting
with
his
arms
folded
in
his
most
dignified
attitude
and
with
an
expression
on
his
face
which
would
have
compelled
both
respect
and
fear
if
i
had
been
guilty
monsieur
de
mauprat
he
said
i
must
request
you
to
grant
me
a
private
interview
will
you
kindly
follow
me
to
my
cottage
yes
i
will
i
replied
i
am
ready
to
endure
any
humiliation
if
only
i
can
learn
what
is
wanted
of
me
and
why
you
are
all
pleased
to
insult
the
most
unfortunate
of
men
lead
the
way
patience
and
go
quickly
i
am
eager
to
return
patience
walked
in
front
of
me
with
an
impassive
air
when
we
arrived
at
his
little
dwelling
we
found
my
poor
sergeant
who
had
just
arrived
likewise
not
finding
any
horse
on
which
he
could
follow
me
and
not
wishing
to
quit
me
he
had
come
on
foot
and
so
quickly
that
he
was
bathed
in
perspiration
nevertheless
the
moment
he
saw
us
he
sprang
up
full
of
life
from
the
bench
on
which
he
had
thrown
himself
under
the
bower
of
and
came
to
meet
us
patience
he
cried
in
a
dramatic
style
which
would
have
made
me
smile
had
it
been
possible
for
me
to
display
a
glimmer
of
mirth
at
such
a
moment
old
fool
slanderer
at
your
age
fie
sir
ruined
by
good
fortune
you
are
patience
impassive
as
ever
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
to
his
friend
marcasse
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
go
and
rest
awhile
at
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
this
matter
does
not
concern
you
i
want
to
speak
to
your
master
alone
i
wish
you
to
go
he
added
taking
him
by
the
arm
and
there
was
a
touch
of
authority
in
his
manner
to
which
the
sergeant
in
spite
of
his
ticklish
prided
yielded
from
instinct
and
habit
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
patience
proceeded
to
the
point
he
began
by
a
series
of
questions
to
which
i
resolved
to
submit
so
that
i
might
the
more
quickly
obtain
some
light
on
the
state
of
affairs
around
me
will
you
kindly
inform
me
monsieur
he
said
what
you
purpose
doing
now
i
purpose
remaining
with
my
family
i
answered
as
long
as
i
have
a
family
and
when
this
family
is
no
more
what
i
shall
do
concerns
no
but
sir
replied
patience
if
you
were
told
that
you
could
not
remain
under
the
same
roof
with
them
without
causing
the
death
of
one
or
the
other
would
you
persist
in
staying
if
i
were
convinced
that
this
was
so
i
rejoined
i
would
not
appear
in
their
presence
i
would
remain
at
their
door
and
await
the
last
day
of
their
life
or
the
first
day
of
their
renewed
health
and
again
implore
a
love
i
have
not
yet
ceased
to
ah
we
have
come
to
this
said
patience
with
a
smile
of
contempt
i
should
not
have
believed
it
however
i
am
very
glad
it
makes
matters
what
do
you
mean
i
cried
speak
you
wretch
explain
yourself
you
are
the
only
wretch
here
he
answered
coldly
at
the
same
time
sitting
down
on
the
one
stool
in
the
cottage
while
i
remained
standing
before
him
i
wanted
to
draw
an
explanation
from
him
at
all
costs
i
restrained
my
feelings
i
even
humbled
myself
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
should
be
ready
to
accept
advice
if
he
would
consent
to
tell
me
the
words
that
edmee
had
uttered
immediately
after
the
event
and
those
which
she
had
repeated
in
her
hours
of
delirium
that
i
will
not
replied
patience
sternly
you
are
not
worthy
to
hear
any
words
from
that
mouth
and
i
shall
certainly
never
repeat
them
to
you
why
do
you
want
to
know
them
do
you
hope
to
hide
anything
from
men
hereafter
god
saw
you
for
him
there
are
no
secrets
leave
this
place
stay
at
keep
quiet
there
and
when
your
uncle
is
dead
and
your
affairs
are
settled
leave
this
part
of
the
country
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
leave
it
this
very
day
i
do
not
want
to
put
the
law
on
your
track
unless
your
actions
force
me
but
others
besides
myself
if
they
are
not
certain
of
the
truth
have
at
least
a
suspicion
of
it
before
two
days
have
passed
a
chance
word
said
in
public
the
indiscretion
of
some
servant
may
awaken
the
attention
of
justice
and
from
that
point
to
the
scaffold
when
a
man
is
guilty
is
but
a
single
step
i
used
not
to
hate
you
i
even
had
a
liking
for
you
take
this
advice
then
which
you
say
you
are
ready
to
follow
go
away
at
once
or
remain
in
hiding
and
ready
for
flight
i
do
not
desire
your
ruin
edmee
would
not
desire
it
either
so
do
you
understand
you
must
be
insane
to
think
that
i
could
listen
to
such
advice
i
hide
myself
or
flee
like
a
murderer
you
can
t
dream
of
that
come
on
come
on
i
defy
the
whole
of
you
i
know
not
what
fury
and
hatred
are
fretting
you
and
uniting
you
all
against
me
i
know
not
why
you
want
to
keep
me
from
seeing
my
uncle
and
cousin
but
i
despise
your
follies
my
place
is
here
i
shall
not
quit
it
except
by
order
of
my
cousin
or
uncle
and
this
order
too
i
must
take
from
their
own
lips
i
can
not
allow
sentence
to
be
brought
me
by
any
outsider
so
thanks
for
your
wisdom
monsieur
patience
in
this
case
my
own
will
suffice
i
am
your
humble
servant
i
was
preparing
to
leave
the
cottage
when
he
rushed
in
front
of
me
and
for
a
moment
i
saw
that
he
was
ready
to
use
force
to
detain
me
in
spite
of
his
advanced
age
in
spite
of
my
height
and
strength
he
might
still
have
been
a
match
perhaps
more
than
a
match
for
me
in
a
struggle
of
this
kind
short
bent
he
was
a
hercules
he
stopped
however
just
as
he
was
about
to
lay
hands
on
me
and
seized
with
one
of
those
fits
of
deep
tenderness
to
which
he
was
subject
in
his
moments
of
greatest
passion
he
gazed
at
me
with
eyes
of
pity
and
said
in
a
gentle
tone
my
poor
boy
you
whom
i
loved
as
a
son
for
i
looked
upon
you
as
edmee
s
brother
do
not
hasten
to
your
ruin
i
beseech
you
in
the
name
of
her
whom
you
have
murdered
and
whom
you
still
love
i
can
see
it
but
whom
you
may
never
behold
again
believe
me
but
yesterday
your
family
was
a
proud
vessel
whose
helm
was
in
your
hands
it
is
a
drifting
wreck
without
either
sail
or
pilot
left
to
be
handled
by
cabinboys
as
friend
marcasse
says
well
my
poor
mariner
do
not
persist
in
drowning
yourself
i
am
throwing
you
a
rope
take
it
a
day
more
and
it
may
be
too
late
remember
that
if
the
law
gets
hold
of
you
the
man
who
is
trying
to
save
you
will
be
obliged
to
appear
against
you
and
condemn
you
do
not
compel
me
to
do
a
thing
the
very
thought
of
which
brings
tears
to
my
eyes
bernard
you
have
been
loved
my
lad
even
you
may
live
on
the
i
burst
into
tears
and
the
sergeant
who
returned
at
this
moment
began
to
weep
also
he
implored
me
to
go
back
to
but
i
soon
recovered
and
thrusting
them
both
away
said
i
know
that
both
of
you
are
excellent
men
and
both
most
generous
you
must
have
some
love
for
me
too
since
though
you
believe
me
blackened
with
a
hideous
crime
you
can
still
think
of
saving
my
life
but
have
no
fears
on
my
account
good
friends
i
am
innocent
of
this
crime
and
my
one
wish
is
that
the
matter
may
be
fully
investigated
so
that
i
may
be
acquitted
yes
this
is
inevitable
i
owe
it
to
my
family
to
live
until
my
honour
has
been
freed
from
stain
then
if
i
am
condemned
to
see
my
cousin
die
as
i
have
no
one
in
the
world
to
love
but
her
i
will
blow
my
brains
out
why
then
should
i
be
downcast
i
set
little
store
by
my
life
may
god
make
the
last
hours
of
her
whom
i
shall
certainly
not
survive
painless
and
peaceful
that
is
all
i
ask
of
patience
shook
his
head
with
a
gloomy
dissatisfied
expression
he
was
so
convinced
of
my
crime
that
all
my
denials
only
served
to
alienate
his
pity
marcasse
still
loved
me
though
he
thought
i
was
guilty
i
had
no
one
in
the
world
to
answer
for
my
innocence
except
myself
if
you
persist
on
returning
to
the
chateau
exclaimed
patience
you
must
swear
before
you
leave
that
you
will
not
enter
your
cousin
s
room
or
your
uncle
s
without
the
abbe
s
what
i
swear
is
that
i
am
innocent
i
replied
and
that
i
will
allow
no
man
to
saddle
me
with
a
crime
back
both
of
you
let
me
pass
patience
if
you
consider
it
your
duty
to
denounce
me
go
and
do
so
all
that
i
ask
is
that
i
may
not
be
condemned
without
a
hearing
i
prefer
the
bar
of
justice
to
that
of
mere
i
rushed
out
of
the
cottage
and
returned
to
the
chateau
however
not
wishing
to
make
a
scandal
before
the
servants
and
knowing
quite
well
that
they
could
not
hide
edmee
s
real
condition
from
me
i
went
and
shut
myself
up
in
the
room
i
usually
occupied
but
in
the
evening
just
as
i
was
leaving
it
to
get
news
of
the
two
patients
mademoiselle
leblanc
again
told
me
that
some
one
wished
to
speak
with
me
outside
i
noticed
that
her
face
betrayed
a
sense
of
joy
as
well
as
fear
i
concluded
that
they
had
come
to
arrest
me
and
i
suspected
rightly
as
it
transpired
that
mademoiselle
leblanc
had
denounced
me
i
went
to
the
window
and
saw
some
of
the
mounted
police
in
the
courtyard
good
i
said
let
my
destiny
take
its
but
before
quitting
perhaps
forever
this
house
in
which
i
was
leaving
my
soul
i
wished
to
see
edmee
again
for
the
last
time
i
walked
straight
to
her
room
mademoiselle
leblanc
tried
to
throw
herself
in
front
of
the
door
i
pushed
her
aside
so
roughly
that
she
fell
and
i
believe
hurt
herself
slightly
she
immediately
filled
the
house
with
her
cries
and
later
in
the
trial
made
a
great
pother
about
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
an
attempt
to
murder
her
i
at
once
entered
edmee
s
room
there
i
found
the
abbe
and
the
doctor
i
listened
in
silence
to
what
the
latter
was
saying
i
learnt
that
the
wounds
in
themselves
were
not
mortal
that
they
would
not
even
be
very
serious
had
not
a
violent
disturbance
in
the
brain
complicated
the
evil
and
made
him
fear
tetanus
this
frightful
word
fell
upon
me
like
a
death
sentence
in
america
i
had
seen
many
men
die
of
this
terrible
malady
the
result
of
wounds
received
in
the
war
i
approached
the
bed
the
abbe
was
so
alarmed
that
he
did
not
think
of
preventing
me
i
took
edmee
s
hand
cold
and
lifeless
as
ever
i
kissed
it
a
last
time
and
without
saying
a
single
word
to
the
others
went
and
gave
myself
up
to
the
police
xxiv
i
was
immediately
thrown
into
prison
at
la
chatre
the
public
prosecutor
for
the
district
of
issoudun
took
in
hand
this
case
of
the
attempted
murder
of
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
and
obtained
permission
to
have
a
monitory
published
on
the
morrow
he
went
to
the
village
of
and
then
to
the
farms
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
curat
woods
where
the
event
had
happened
and
took
the
depositions
of
more
than
thirty
witnesses
then
eight
days
after
i
had
been
arrested
the
writ
of
arrest
was
issued
if
my
mind
had
been
less
distracted
or
if
some
one
had
interested
himself
in
me
this
breach
of
the
law
and
many
others
that
occurred
during
the
trial
might
have
been
adduced
as
powerful
arguments
in
my
favour
they
would
at
least
have
shown
that
the
proceedings
were
inspired
by
some
secret
hatred
in
the
whole
course
of
the
affair
an
invisible
hand
directed
everything
with
pitiless
haste
and
severity
the
first
examination
had
produced
but
a
single
indictment
against
me
this
came
from
mademoiselle
leblanc
the
men
who
had
taken
part
in
the
hunt
declared
that
they
knew
nothing
and
had
no
reason
to
regard
the
occurrence
as
a
deliberate
attempt
at
murder
mademoiselle
leblanc
however
who
had
an
old
grudge
against
me
for
certain
jokes
i
had
ventured
to
make
at
her
expense
and
who
moreover
had
been
suborned
as
i
learned
afterward
declared
that
edmee
on
recovering
from
her
first
swoon
at
a
time
when
she
was
quite
calm
and
in
full
possession
of
her
reason
had
confided
to
her
under
a
pledge
of
secrecy
that
she
had
been
insulted
threatened
dragged
from
her
horse
and
finally
shot
by
me
this
wicked
old
maid
putting
together
the
various
revelations
that
edmee
had
made
in
her
delirium
had
cleverly
enough
composed
a
connected
narrative
and
added
to
it
all
the
embellishments
that
hatred
could
suggest
distorting
the
incoherent
words
and
vague
impressions
of
her
mistress
she
declared
upon
oath
that
edmee
had
seen
me
point
the
barrel
of
my
carbine
at
her
with
the
words
as
i
swore
you
shall
die
by
my
who
was
examined
the
same
day
declared
that
he
knew
nothing
beyond
what
mademoiselle
leblanc
had
told
him
that
evening
and
his
deposition
was
very
similar
to
hers
he
was
honest
enough
but
dull
and
from
love
of
exactness
he
omitted
no
trifling
detail
which
might
be
interpreted
against
me
he
asserted
that
i
had
always
been
subject
to
pains
in
the
head
during
which
i
lost
my
senses
that
several
times
previously
when
my
nerves
were
disordered
i
had
spoken
of
blood
and
murder
to
some
individual
whom
i
always
fancied
i
could
see
and
finally
that
my
temper
was
so
violent
that
i
was
capable
of
throwing
the
first
thing
that
came
to
hand
at
any
one
s
head
though
as
a
fact
i
had
never
to
his
knowledge
committed
any
excess
of
this
such
are
the
depositions
that
frequently
decide
life
and
death
in
criminal
cases
patience
could
not
be
found
on
the
day
of
this
inquiry
the
abbe
declared
that
his
ideas
on
the
occurrence
were
so
vague
that
he
would
undergo
all
the
penalties
inflicted
on
recalcitrant
witnesses
rather
than
express
his
opinion
before
fuller
investigations
had
been
made
he
requested
the
public
prosecutor
to
give
him
time
promising
on
his
honour
that
he
would
not
resist
the
demands
of
justice
and
representing
that
at
the
end
of
a
few
days
by
inquiring
into
certain
things
he
would
probably
arrive
at
a
conviction
of
some
sort
in
this
event
he
undertook
to
speak
plainly
either
for
or
against
me
this
delay
was
granted
marcasse
simply
said
that
if
i
had
inflicted
the
wounds
on
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
about
which
he
was
beginning
to
feel
very
doubtful
i
had
at
least
inflicted
them
unintentionally
on
this
he
was
prepared
to
stake
his
honour
and
his
life
such
was
the
result
of
the
first
inquiry
it
was
resumed
at
various
times
during
the
following
days
and
several
false
witnesses
swore
that
they
had
seen
me
shoot
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
after
vainly
endeavouring
to
make
her
yield
to
my
wishes
one
of
the
most
baneful
instruments
of
ancient
criminal
procedure
was
what
was
known
as
the
monitory
this
was
a
notice
from
the
pulpit
given
out
by
the
bishop
and
repeated
by
all
vicars
to
their
parishioners
ordering
them
to
make
inquiries
about
the
crime
in
question
and
to
reveal
all
the
facts
which
might
come
to
their
knowledge
this
was
merely
a
modified
form
of
the
inquisitorial
principle
which
reigned
more
openly
in
other
countries
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
monitory
which
had
as
a
fact
been
instituted
in
order
to
encourage
informers
in
the
name
of
religion
was
a
marvel
of
ridiculous
atrocity
it
frequently
set
forth
the
crime
and
all
the
imaginary
circumstances
the
plaintiffs
were
eager
to
prove
it
was
in
short
the
publication
of
a
case
which
gave
the
first
knave
that
came
a
chance
of
earning
some
money
by
making
a
lying
deposition
in
favour
of
the
highest
bidder
the
inevitable
effect
of
the
monitory
when
it
was
drawn
up
with
a
bias
was
to
arouse
public
hatred
against
the
accused
the
devout
especially
receiving
their
opinions
from
the
clergy
pursued
the
victim
without
mercy
this
is
what
happened
in
my
own
case
but
here
the
clergy
of
the
province
were
playing
a
further
secret
part
which
almost
decided
my
fate
the
case
was
taken
to
the
assizes
at
the
court
of
bourges
and
proceedings
began
in
a
very
few
days
you
can
imagine
the
gloomy
despair
with
which
i
was
filled
edmee
s
condition
was
growing
more
and
more
serious
her
mind
was
completely
unhinged
i
felt
no
anxiety
as
to
the
result
of
the
trial
i
never
imagined
it
was
possible
to
convict
me
of
a
crime
i
had
not
committed
but
what
were
honour
and
life
to
me
if
edmee
were
never
to
regain
the
power
of
recognising
my
innocence
i
looked
upon
her
as
already
dead
and
as
having
cursed
me
dying
so
i
was
inflexibly
resolved
to
kill
myself
immediately
after
receiving
my
sentence
whatever
it
might
be
until
then
i
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
to
live
and
to
do
what
might
be
necessary
for
the
triumph
of
truth
but
i
was
plunged
in
such
a
state
of
stupor
that
i
did
not
even
think
of
ascertaining
what
was
to
be
done
had
it
not
been
for
the
cleverness
and
zeal
of
my
counsel
and
the
sublime
devotion
of
marcasse
my
listlessness
would
have
left
me
to
the
most
terrible
fate
marcasse
spent
all
his
time
in
expeditions
on
my
behalf
in
the
evening
he
would
come
and
throw
himself
on
a
bundle
of
straw
at
the
foot
of
my
trunkle
bed
and
after
giving
me
news
of
edmee
and
the
chevalier
whom
he
went
to
see
every
day
he
would
tell
me
the
results
of
his
proceedings
i
used
to
grasp
his
hand
affectionately
but
i
was
generally
so
absorbed
by
the
news
he
had
just
given
me
of
edmee
that
i
never
heard
anything
further
this
prison
of
la
chatre
had
formerly
been
the
stronghold
of
the
elevains
of
lombaud
the
seigneurs
of
the
province
nothing
was
left
of
it
but
a
formidable
square
tower
at
the
top
of
a
ravine
where
the
indre
forms
a
narrow
winding
valley
rich
with
the
most
beautiful
vegetation
the
weather
was
magnificent
my
room
situated
at
the
top
of
the
tower
received
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
which
cast
the
long
thin
shadows
of
a
triple
row
of
poplars
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
never
did
landscape
more
smiling
fresh
and
pastoral
offer
itself
to
the
eyes
of
a
prisoner
but
how
could
i
find
pleasure
in
it
words
of
death
and
contumely
came
to
me
in
every
breeze
that
blew
through
the
growing
in
the
crannies
every
rustic
sound
every
tune
on
the
pipe
that
rose
to
my
room
seemed
to
contain
an
insult
or
to
proclaim
profound
contempt
for
my
sorrow
there
was
nothing
even
to
the
bleating
of
the
flocks
which
did
not
appear
to
me
an
expression
of
neglect
or
indifference
for
some
time
marcasse
had
had
one
fixed
idea
namely
that
edmee
had
been
shot
by
john
mauprat
it
was
possible
but
as
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
conjecture
i
at
once
ordered
him
not
to
make
known
his
suspicions
it
was
not
for
me
to
clear
myself
at
the
expense
of
others
although
john
mauprat
was
capable
of
anything
it
was
possible
that
he
had
never
thought
of
committing
this
crime
and
as
i
had
not
heard
him
spoken
of
for
more
than
six
weeks
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
have
been
cowardly
to
accuse
him
i
clung
to
the
belief
that
one
of
the
men
in
the
battue
had
fired
at
edmee
by
mistake
and
that
a
feeling
of
fear
and
shame
prevented
him
from
confessing
his
misadventure
marcasse
had
the
courage
to
go
and
see
all
those
who
had
taken
part
in
the
hunt
and
with
such
eloquence
as
heaven
had
granted
him
implored
them
not
to
fear
the
penalty
for
unintentional
murder
and
not
to
allow
an
innocent
man
to
be
accused
in
their
stead
all
these
efforts
were
fruitless
from
none
of
the
huntsmen
did
my
poor
friend
obtain
a
reply
which
left
him
any
nearer
a
solution
of
the
mystery
that
surrounded
us
on
being
transferred
to
bourges
i
was
thrown
into
the
castle
which
had
belonged
to
the
old
dukes
of
berry
this
was
henceforth
to
be
my
prison
it
was
a
great
grief
to
me
to
be
separated
from
my
faithful
sergeant
he
would
have
been
allowed
to
follow
me
but
he
had
a
presentiment
that
he
would
soon
be
arrested
at
the
suggestion
of
my
enemies
for
he
persisted
in
believing
that
i
was
the
victim
of
a
plot
and
thus
be
unable
to
serve
me
any
more
he
wished
therefore
to
lose
no
time
and
to
continue
his
investigations
as
long
as
they
should
not
have
seized
his
two
days
after
my
removal
to
bourges
marcasse
produced
a
document
which
had
been
drawn
up
at
his
instance
by
two
notaries
of
la
chatre
it
contained
the
depositions
of
ten
witnesses
to
the
effect
that
for
some
days
before
the
attempted
assassination
a
mendicant
friar
had
been
prowling
about
varenne
that
he
had
appeared
in
different
places
very
close
together
and
notably
that
he
had
slept
at
de
poligny
the
night
before
the
event
marcasse
maintained
that
this
monk
was
john
mauprat
two
women
declared
that
they
had
thought
they
recognised
him
either
as
john
or
walter
mauprat
who
closely
resembled
him
but
walter
had
been
found
drowned
the
day
after
the
capture
of
the
keep
and
the
whole
town
of
la
chatre
on
the
day
when
edmee
was
shot
had
seen
the
trappist
engaged
with
the
carmelite
prior
from
morning
till
night
in
conducting
the
procession
and
services
for
the
pilgrimage
of
vaudevant
these
depositions
therefore
so
far
from
being
favourable
to
me
produced
a
very
bad
effect
and
threw
odium
on
my
defence
the
trappist
conclusively
proved
his
alibi
and
the
prior
of
the
carmelites
helped
him
to
spread
a
report
that
i
was
a
worthless
villain
this
was
a
time
of
triumph
for
john
mauprat
he
proclaimed
aloud
that
he
had
come
to
deliver
himself
up
to
his
natural
judges
to
suffer
punishment
for
his
crimes
in
the
past
but
no
one
could
think
of
prosecuting
such
a
holy
man
the
fanaticism
that
he
inspired
in
our
eminently
devout
province
was
such
that
no
magistrate
would
have
dared
to
brave
public
opinion
by
proceeding
against
him
in
his
own
depositions
marcasse
gave
an
account
of
the
mysterious
and
inexplicable
appearance
of
the
trappist
at
the
steps
he
had
taken
to
obtain
an
interview
with
hubert
and
his
daughter
his
insolence
in
entering
and
terrifying
them
in
their
and
the
efforts
the
carmelite
prior
had
made
to
obtain
considerable
sums
of
money
from
me
on
behalf
of
this
individual
all
these
depositions
were
treated
as
fairy
tales
for
marcasse
admitted
that
he
had
not
seen
the
trappist
in
any
of
the
places
mentioned
and
neither
the
chevalier
nor
his
daughter
was
able
to
give
evidence
it
is
true
that
my
answers
to
the
various
questions
put
to
me
confirmed
marcasse
s
statements
but
as
i
declared
in
all
sincerity
that
for
some
two
months
the
trappist
had
given
me
no
cause
for
uneasiness
or
displeasure
and
as
i
refused
to
attribute
the
murder
to
him
it
seemed
for
some
days
as
if
he
would
be
forever
reinstated
in
public
opinion
my
lack
of
animosity
against
him
did
not
however
diminish
that
which
my
judges
showed
against
me
they
made
use
of
the
arbitrary
powers
which
magistrates
had
in
bygone
days
especially
in
remote
parts
of
the
provinces
and
they
paralyzed
all
my
lawyer
s
efforts
by
a
fierce
haste
several
legal
personages
whose
names
i
will
not
menton
indulged
even
publicly
in
a
strain
of
invective
against
me
which
ought
to
have
excluded
them
from
any
court
dealing
with
questions
of
human
dignity
and
morality
they
intrigued
to
induce
me
to
confess
and
almost
went
so
far
as
to
promise
me
a
favourable
verdict
if
i
at
least
acknowledged
that
i
had
wounded
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
accidently
the
scorn
with
which
i
met
these
overtures
alienated
them
altogether
a
stranger
to
all
intrigue
at
a
time
when
justice
and
truth
could
not
triumph
except
by
intrigue
i
was
a
victim
of
two
redoubtable
enemies
the
church
and
the
law
the
former
i
had
offended
in
the
person
of
the
carmelite
prior
and
the
latter
hated
me
because
of
the
suitors
whom
edmee
had
repulsed
the
most
spiteful
was
a
man
closely
related
to
the
chief
magistrate
nevertheless
a
few
honest
men
to
whom
i
was
almost
unknown
took
an
interest
in
my
case
on
account
of
the
efforts
of
others
to
make
my
name
odious
one
of
them
a
monsieur
e
who
was
not
without
influence
for
he
was
the
brother
of
the
sheriff
of
the
province
and
acquainted
with
all
the
deputies
rendered
me
a
service
by
the
excellent
suggestions
he
made
for
throwing
light
on
this
complicated
affair
patience
convinced
as
he
was
of
my
guilt
might
have
served
my
enemies
without
wishing
to
do
so
but
he
would
not
he
had
resumed
his
roaming
life
in
the
woods
and
though
he
did
not
hide
could
never
be
found
marcasse
was
very
uneasy
about
his
intentions
and
could
not
understand
his
conduct
at
all
the
police
were
furious
to
find
that
an
old
man
was
making
a
fool
of
them
and
that
without
going
beyond
a
radius
of
a
few
leagues
i
fancy
that
the
old
fellow
with
his
habits
and
constitution
could
have
lived
for
years
in
varenne
without
falling
into
their
hands
and
moreover
without
feeling
that
longing
to
surrender
which
a
sense
of
and
the
horror
of
solitude
so
frequently
arouse
even
in
great
criminals
xxv
the
day
of
the
public
trial
came
i
went
to
face
it
quite
calmly
but
the
sight
of
the
crowd
filled
me
with
a
profound
melancholy
no
support
no
sympathy
for
me
there
it
seemed
to
me
that
on
such
an
occasion
i
might
at
least
have
looked
for
that
show
of
respect
to
which
the
unfortunate
and
friendless
are
entitled
yet
on
all
the
faces
around
i
saw
nothing
but
a
brutal
and
insolent
curiosity
girls
of
the
lower
classes
talked
loudly
of
my
looks
and
my
youth
a
large
number
of
women
belonging
to
the
nobility
or
moneyed
classes
displayed
their
brilliant
dresses
in
the
galleries
as
if
they
had
come
to
some
a
great
many
monks
showed
their
shaven
crowns
in
the
middle
of
the
populace
which
they
were
inciting
against
me
from
their
crowded
ranks
i
could
frequently
catch
the
words
brigand
ungodly
and
wild
the
men
of
fashion
in
the
district
were
lolling
on
the
seats
of
honour
and
discussing
my
passion
in
the
language
of
the
gutter
i
saw
and
heard
everything
with
that
tranquility
which
springs
from
a
profound
disgust
of
life
even
as
a
traveller
who
has
come
to
the
end
of
his
journey
may
look
with
indifference
and
weariness
on
the
eager
bustle
of
those
who
are
setting
off
for
a
more
distant
goal
the
trial
began
with
that
emphatic
solemnity
which
at
all
times
has
been
associated
with
the
exercise
of
judicial
power
my
examination
was
short
in
spite
of
the
innumerable
questions
that
were
asked
me
about
my
whole
life
my
answers
singularly
disappointed
the
expectations
of
public
curiosity
and
shortened
the
trial
considerably
i
confined
myself
to
three
principal
replies
the
substance
of
which
i
never
changed
firstly
to
all
questions
concerning
my
childhood
and
education
i
replied
that
i
had
not
come
into
the
defendant
s
dock
to
accuse
others
secondly
to
those
bearing
on
edmee
the
nature
of
my
feeling
for
her
and
my
relations
with
her
i
replied
that
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
s
worth
and
reputation
could
not
permit
even
the
simplest
question
as
to
the
nature
of
her
relations
with
any
man
whatever
and
that
as
to
my
feelings
for
her
i
was
accountable
for
them
to
no
one
thirdly
to
those
which
were
designed
to
make
me
confess
my
pretended
crime
i
replied
that
i
was
not
even
the
unwilling
author
of
the
accident
in
brief
answers
i
gave
some
details
of
the
events
immediately
preceding
it
but
feeling
that
i
owed
it
to
edmee
as
much
as
to
myself
to
be
silent
about
the
tumultuous
impulses
that
had
stirred
me
i
explained
the
scene
which
had
resulted
in
my
quitting
her
as
being
due
to
a
fall
from
my
horse
and
that
i
had
been
found
some
distance
from
her
body
was
i
said
because
i
had
deemed
it
advisable
to
run
after
my
horse
so
that
i
might
again
escort
her
unfortunately
all
this
was
not
very
clear
and
naturally
could
not
be
my
horse
had
gone
off
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
which
i
said
and
the
bewildered
state
in
which
i
had
been
found
before
i
knew
of
the
accident
was
not
sufficiently
explained
by
a
fall
from
my
horse
they
questioned
me
especially
about
the
gallop
i
had
had
with
my
cousin
through
the
wood
instead
of
following
the
hunt
as
we
had
intended
they
would
not
believe
that
we
had
gone
astray
guided
altogether
by
chance
it
was
impossible
they
said
to
look
upon
chance
as
a
reasonable
being
armed
with
a
gun
waiting
for
edmee
at
gazeau
tower
at
an
appointed
time
in
order
to
shoot
her
the
moment
i
turned
my
back
for
five
minutes
they
pretended
that
i
must
have
taken
her
to
this
spot
either
by
craft
or
force
to
outrage
her
and
that
i
had
tried
to
kill
her
either
from
rage
at
not
succeeding
or
from
fear
of
being
discovered
and
punished
for
my
crime
then
all
the
witnesses
for
and
against
me
were
heard
it
is
true
that
among
the
former
marcasse
was
the
only
one
who
could
really
be
considered
as
a
witness
for
the
defence
the
rest
merely
affirmed
that
a
monk
bearing
a
resemblance
to
the
mauprats
had
been
roaming
about
varenne
at
the
period
in
question
and
that
he
had
even
appeared
to
hide
himself
on
the
evening
of
the
event
since
then
he
had
not
been
seen
these
depositions
which
i
had
not
solicited
and
which
i
declared
had
not
been
taken
at
my
request
caused
me
considerable
astonishment
for
among
the
witnesses
who
made
them
i
saw
some
of
the
most
honest
folk
in
the
country
however
they
had
no
weight
except
in
the
eyes
of
monsieur
e
the
magistrate
who
was
really
interested
in
discovering
the
truth
he
interposed
and
asked
me
how
it
was
that
jean
de
mauprat
had
not
been
summoned
to
confront
these
witnesses
seeing
that
he
had
taken
the
trouble
to
put
in
his
affidavit
to
prove
an
alibi
this
objection
was
received
with
a
murmur
of
indignation
there
were
not
a
few
people
however
who
by
no
means
looked
upon
john
mauprat
as
a
saint
but
they
took
no
interest
in
myself
and
had
merely
come
to
the
trial
as
to
a
play
the
enthusiasm
of
the
bigots
reached
a
climax
when
the
trappist
suddenly
stood
up
in
the
crowd
throwing
back
his
cowl
in
a
theatrical
manner
he
boldly
approached
the
bar
declaring
that
he
was
a
miserable
sinner
worthy
of
all
scorn
but
on
this
occasion
when
it
was
the
duty
of
every
one
to
strive
for
truth
he
considered
it
incumbent
on
him
to
set
an
example
of
simple
candour
by
voluntarily
offering
himself
for
any
examination
which
might
shed
light
on
the
judges
minds
these
words
were
greeted
with
applause
the
trappist
was
admitted
to
the
and
confronted
with
the
witnesses
who
all
declared
without
any
hesitation
that
the
monk
they
had
seen
wore
the
same
habit
as
this
man
and
that
there
was
a
family
likeness
a
sort
of
distant
resemblance
between
the
two
but
that
it
was
not
the
same
person
on
this
point
they
had
not
the
least
doubt
the
result
of
this
incident
was
a
fresh
triumph
for
the
trappist
no
one
seemed
to
notice
that
as
the
witnesses
had
displayed
so
much
candour
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
they
had
not
really
seen
another
trappist
at
this
moment
i
remembered
that
at
the
time
of
the
abbe
s
first
interview
with
john
mauprat
at
the
spring
at
fougeres
the
latter
had
let
fall
a
few
words
about
a
friar
of
the
same
order
who
was
travelling
with
him
and
had
passed
the
night
at
the
goulets
farm
i
thought
it
advisable
to
mention
this
fact
to
my
counsel
he
discussed
it
in
a
low
voice
with
the
abbe
who
was
sitting
among
the
witnesses
the
latter
remembered
the
circumstance
quite
clearly
but
was
unable
to
add
any
further
details
when
it
came
to
the
abbe
s
turn
to
give
evidence
he
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
of
agony
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
he
answered
the
formal
questions
with
difficulty
and
in
an
almost
inaudible
voice
he
made
a
great
effort
to
master
himself
and
finally
he
gave
his
evidence
in
these
words
i
was
driving
in
the
woods
when
le
chevalier
hubert
de
mauprat
requested
me
to
alight
and
see
what
had
become
of
his
daughter
edmee
who
had
been
missing
from
the
field
long
enough
to
cause
him
uneasiness
i
ran
for
some
distance
and
when
i
was
about
thirty
yards
from
gazeau
tower
i
found
bernard
de
mauprat
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
i
had
just
heard
a
gun
fired
i
noticed
that
he
was
no
longer
carrying
his
carbine
he
had
thrown
it
down
discharged
as
has
been
proved
a
few
yards
away
we
both
hastened
to
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
whom
we
found
lying
on
the
ground
with
two
bullets
in
her
another
man
had
reached
her
before
us
and
was
standing
near
her
at
this
moment
he
alone
can
make
known
the
words
he
heard
from
her
lips
she
was
unconscious
when
i
saw
but
you
heard
the
exact
words
from
this
individual
said
the
president
for
rumour
has
it
that
there
is
a
close
friendship
between
yourself
and
the
learned
peasant
known
as
the
abbe
hesitated
and
asked
if
the
laws
of
conscience
were
not
in
this
case
at
variance
with
the
laws
of
the
land
and
if
the
judges
had
a
right
to
ask
a
man
to
reveal
a
secret
intrusted
to
his
honour
and
to
make
him
break
his
word
you
have
taken
an
oath
here
in
the
name
of
christ
to
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
was
the
reply
it
is
for
you
to
judge
whether
this
oath
is
not
more
solemn
than
any
you
may
have
made
but
if
i
had
received
this
secret
under
the
seal
of
the
confessional
said
the
abbe
you
certainly
would
not
urge
me
to
reveal
i
believe
monsieur
l
abbe
said
the
president
that
it
is
some
time
since
you
confessed
any
at
this
unbecoming
remark
i
noticed
an
expression
of
mirth
on
john
mauprat
s
face
a
fiendish
mirth
which
brought
back
to
me
the
man
as
i
knew
him
of
old
convulsed
with
laughter
at
the
sight
of
suffering
and
tears
the
annoyance
which
the
abbe
felt
at
this
personal
attack
gave
him
the
courage
which
might
otherwise
have
been
wanting
he
remained
for
a
few
moments
with
downcast
eyes
they
thought
that
he
was
humiliated
but
as
soon
as
he
raised
his
head
they
saw
his
eyes
flashing
with
the
malicious
obstinacy
of
the
priest
all
things
considered
he
said
in
the
most
gentle
tone
i
think
that
my
conscience
bids
me
keep
this
secret
i
shall
keep
aubert
said
the
king
s
advocate
angrily
you
are
apparently
unaware
of
the
penalties
which
the
law
inflicts
on
witnesses
who
behave
as
you
are
i
am
aware
of
them
replied
the
abbe
in
a
still
milder
tone
doubtless
then
you
do
not
intend
to
defy
them
i
will
undergo
them
if
necessary
rejoined
the
abbe
with
an
imperceptible
smile
of
pride
and
such
a
dignified
bearing
that
all
the
women
were
touched
women
are
excellent
judges
of
things
that
are
delicately
beautiful
very
good
replied
the
public
prosecutor
do
you
intend
to
persist
in
this
course
of
silence
perhaps
replied
the
abbe
will
you
tell
us
whether
during
the
days
that
followed
this
attempt
to
murder
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
you
were
in
a
position
to
hear
the
words
she
uttered
either
during
her
delirium
or
during
her
lucid
intervals
i
can
give
you
no
information
on
that
point
answered
the
abbe
it
would
be
against
my
inclinations
and
moreover
in
my
eyes
an
outrage
on
propriety
to
repeat
words
which
in
the
case
of
delirium
could
prove
absolutely
nothing
and
if
uttered
in
a
lucid
moment
could
only
have
been
the
outpouring
of
a
genuinely
filial
very
good
said
the
king
s
advocate
rising
we
shall
call
upon
the
court
to
deliberate
on
your
refusal
of
evidence
taking
this
incident
in
connection
with
the
main
and
i
said
the
president
in
virtue
of
my
discretionary
power
do
order
that
aubert
be
meanwhile
arrested
and
taken
to
the
abbe
allowed
himself
to
be
led
away
with
unaffected
calmness
the
spectators
were
filled
with
respect
and
a
profound
silence
reigned
in
court
in
spite
of
the
bitter
efforts
of
the
monks
and
cures
who
continued
to
revile
the
heretic
in
an
undertone
when
the
various
witnesses
had
been
heard
and
i
must
say
that
those
who
had
been
suborned
played
their
part
very
feebly
in
public
to
crown
all
mademoiselle
leblanc
appeared
i
was
surprised
to
find
the
old
maid
so
bitter
against
me
and
able
to
turn
her
hatred
to
such
account
in
truth
the
weapons
she
could
bring
against
me
were
only
too
powerful
in
virtue
of
the
right
which
domestics
claim
to
listen
at
doors
and
overhear
family
secrets
this
skilled
misinterpreter
and
prolific
liar
had
learnt
and
shaped
to
her
own
purposes
most
of
the
facts
in
my
life
which
could
be
utilized
for
my
ruin
she
related
how
seven
years
before
i
had
arrived
at
the
chateau
of
with
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
whom
i
had
rescued
from
the
roughness
and
wickedness
of
my
uncles
and
let
that
be
said
she
added
turning
toward
john
mauprat
with
a
polite
bow
without
any
reference
to
the
holy
man
in
this
court
who
was
once
a
great
sinner
and
is
now
a
great
saint
but
at
what
a
price
she
continued
facing
the
judges
again
had
this
miserable
bandit
saved
my
dear
mistress
he
had
dishonoured
her
gentlemen
and
throughout
the
days
that
followed
the
poor
young
lady
had
abandoned
herself
to
grief
and
shame
on
account
of
the
violence
which
had
been
done
her
for
which
nothing
could
bring
consolation
too
proud
to
breath
her
misfortune
to
a
single
soul
and
too
honest
to
deceive
any
man
she
broke
off
her
engagement
with
de
la
marche
whom
she
loved
passionately
and
who
returned
her
passion
she
refused
every
offer
of
marriage
that
was
made
her
and
all
from
a
sense
of
honour
for
in
reality
she
hated
bernard
at
first
she
wanted
to
kill
herself
indeed
she
had
one
of
her
father
s
little
sharpened
and
marcasse
can
tell
you
the
same
if
he
chooses
to
remember
she
would
certainly
have
killed
herself
if
i
had
not
thrown
this
knife
into
the
well
belonging
to
the
house
she
had
to
think
too
of
defending
herself
against
the
night
attacks
of
her
persecutor
and
as
long
as
she
had
this
knife
she
always
used
to
put
it
under
her
pillow
every
night
she
would
bolt
the
door
of
her
room
and
frequently
i
have
seen
her
rush
back
pale
and
ready
to
faint
quite
out
of
breath
like
a
person
who
has
just
been
pursued
and
had
a
great
fright
when
this
gentleman
began
to
receive
some
education
and
learn
good
manners
mademoiselle
seeing
that
she
could
never
have
any
other
husband
since
he
was
always
talking
of
killing
any
man
who
dared
to
present
himself
hoped
he
would
get
rid
of
his
fierceness
and
was
most
kind
and
good
to
him
she
even
nursed
him
during
his
illness
not
that
she
liked
and
esteemed
him
as
much
as
marcasse
was
pleased
to
say
in
his
version
but
she
was
always
afraid
that
in
his
delirium
he
might
reveal
either
to
the
servants
or
her
father
the
secret
of
the
injury
he
had
done
her
this
her
modesty
and
pride
made
her
most
anxious
to
conceal
as
all
the
ladies
present
will
readily
understand
when
the
family
went
to
paris
for
the
winter
of
bernard
became
jealous
and
tyrannical
and
threatened
so
frequently
to
kill
de
la
marche
that
mademoiselle
was
obliged
to
send
the
latter
away
after
that
she
had
some
violent
scenes
with
bernard
and
declared
that
she
did
not
and
never
would
love
him
in
his
rage
and
grief
for
it
can
not
be
denied
that
he
was
enamoured
of
her
in
his
tigerish
fashion
he
went
off
to
america
and
during
the
six
years
he
spent
there
his
letters
seemed
to
show
that
he
had
much
improved
by
the
time
he
returned
mademoiselle
had
made
up
her
mind
to
be
an
old
maid
and
had
become
quite
calm
again
and
bernard
too
seemed
to
have
grown
into
a
fairly
good
young
gentleman
however
through
seeing
her
every
day
and
everlastingly
leaning
over
the
back
of
her
or
winding
her
skeins
of
wool
and
whispering
to
her
while
her
father
was
asleep
he
fell
so
deeply
in
love
again
that
he
lost
his
head
i
do
not
wish
to
be
too
hard
on
him
poor
creature
and
i
fancy
his
right
place
is
in
the
asylum
rather
than
on
the
scaffold
he
used
to
shout
and
groan
all
night
long
and
the
letters
he
wrote
her
were
so
stupid
that
she
used
to
smile
as
she
read
them
and
then
put
them
in
her
pocket
without
answering
them
here
is
one
of
these
letters
that
i
found
upon
her
when
i
undressed
her
after
the
horrible
deed
a
bullet
has
gone
through
it
and
it
is
stained
with
blood
but
enough
may
still
be
read
to
show
that
monsieur
frequently
intended
to
kill
so
saying
she
put
down
on
the
table
a
sheet
of
paper
half
burnt
and
half
covered
with
blood
which
sent
a
shudder
through
the
spectators
genuine
with
some
of
them
mere
affectation
with
many
others
before
this
letter
was
read
she
finished
her
deposition
and
ended
it
with
some
assertions
which
perplexed
me
considerably
for
i
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
boundary
between
truth
and
perfidy
ever
since
her
accident
she
said
mademoiselle
has
been
hovering
between
life
and
death
she
will
certainly
never
recover
whatever
the
doctors
may
declare
i
venture
to
say
that
these
gentlemen
who
only
see
the
patient
at
certain
hours
do
not
understand
her
illness
as
well
as
i
who
have
never
left
her
for
a
single
night
they
pretend
that
her
wounds
are
going
on
well
and
that
her
head
is
deranged
whereas
i
say
that
her
wounds
are
going
on
badly
and
that
her
head
is
better
than
they
say
mademoiselle
very
rarely
talks
irrationally
and
if
by
chance
she
does
it
is
in
the
presence
of
these
gentlemen
who
confuse
and
frighten
her
she
then
makes
such
efforts
not
to
appear
mad
that
she
actually
becomes
so
but
as
soon
as
they
leave
her
alone
with
me
or
or
monsieur
l
abbe
who
could
quite
well
have
told
you
how
things
are
if
he
had
wished
she
becomes
calm
again
and
sweet
and
sensible
as
usual
she
says
that
she
could
almost
die
of
pain
although
to
the
doctors
she
pretends
that
she
is
scarcely
suffering
at
all
and
then
she
speaks
of
her
murderer
with
the
generosity
that
becomes
a
christian
a
hundred
times
a
day
she
will
say
may
god
pardon
him
in
the
next
life
as
i
pardon
him
in
this
after
all
a
man
must
be
very
fond
of
a
woman
to
kill
her
i
was
wrong
not
to
marry
him
perhaps
he
would
have
made
me
happy
i
drove
him
to
despair
and
he
has
avenged
himself
on
me
dear
leblanc
take
care
never
to
betray
the
secret
i
have
told
you
a
single
indiscreet
word
might
send
him
to
the
scaffold
and
that
would
be
the
death
of
my
the
poor
young
lady
is
far
from
imagining
that
things
have
come
to
this
pass
that
i
have
been
summoned
by
the
law
and
my
religion
to
make
known
what
i
would
rather
conceal
and
that
instead
of
going
out
to
get
an
apparatus
for
her
i
have
come
here
to
confess
the
truth
the
only
thing
that
consoles
me
is
that
it
will
be
easy
to
hide
all
this
from
le
chevalier
who
has
no
more
sense
now
than
a
babe
just
born
for
myself
i
have
done
my
duty
may
god
be
my
judge
after
speaking
thus
with
perfect
and
great
volubility
mademoiselle
leblanc
sat
down
again
amid
a
murmur
of
approbation
and
they
proceeded
to
read
the
letter
which
had
been
found
on
edmee
it
was
indeed
the
one
i
had
written
to
her
only
a
few
days
before
the
fatal
day
they
handed
it
to
me
i
could
not
help
pressing
my
lips
to
the
stains
of
edmee
s
blood
then
after
glancing
at
the
writing
i
returned
the
letter
and
declared
quite
calmly
that
it
was
written
by
me
the
reading
of
this
letter
was
my
de
fate
who
seems
ingenious
in
injuring
her
victims
had
obtained
and
perhaps
some
famous
hand
had
contributed
to
the
mutilation
that
the
passages
expressing
my
obedience
and
respect
should
be
destroyed
certain
poetic
touches
which
might
have
furnished
an
explanation
of
and
an
excuse
for
my
wild
ramblings
were
illegible
what
showed
plain
to
every
eye
and
carried
conviction
to
every
mind
were
the
lines
that
remained
intact
the
lines
that
bore
witness
to
the
violence
of
my
passion
and
the
vehemence
of
my
frenzy
they
were
such
phrases
as
these
sometimes
i
feel
inclined
to
rise
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
go
and
kill
you
i
should
have
done
this
a
hundred
times
if
i
had
been
sure
that
i
should
love
you
no
more
after
your
death
be
considerate
for
there
are
two
men
in
me
and
sometimes
the
brigand
of
old
lords
it
over
the
new
man
a
smile
of
triumph
played
about
my
enemies
mouths
my
supporters
were
demoralized
and
even
my
poor
sergeant
looked
at
me
in
despair
the
public
had
already
condemned
me
this
incident
afforded
the
king
s
advocate
a
fine
chance
of
thundering
forth
a
pompous
address
in
which
he
described
me
as
an
incurable
blackguard
as
an
accursed
branch
of
an
accursed
stock
as
an
example
of
the
fatality
of
evil
instincts
then
after
exerting
himself
to
hold
me
up
as
an
object
of
horror
and
fear
he
endeavoured
in
order
to
give
himself
an
air
of
impartiality
and
generosity
to
arouse
the
compassion
of
the
judges
in
my
favour
he
proceeded
to
show
that
i
was
not
responsible
for
my
actions
that
my
mind
had
been
perverted
in
early
childhood
by
foul
sights
and
vile
principles
and
was
not
sound
nor
ever
could
have
been
whatever
the
origin
and
growth
of
my
passions
at
last
after
going
through
a
course
of
philosophy
and
rhetoric
to
the
great
delight
of
the
audience
he
demanded
that
i
should
be
condemned
to
privation
of
civil
rights
and
imprisonment
for
life
though
my
counsel
was
a
man
of
spirit
and
intelligence
the
letter
had
so
taken
him
by
surprise
the
people
in
court
were
so
unfavourably
disposed
towards
me
and
the
judges
as
they
listened
to
him
so
frequently
showed
signs
of
incredulity
and
impatience
an
unseemly
habit
which
appears
to
be
the
heritage
of
the
magisterial
benches
of
this
country
that
his
defence
was
tame
all
that
he
seemed
justified
in
demanding
with
any
vigour
was
a
further
inquiry
he
complained
that
all
the
formalities
had
not
been
fulfilled
that
sufficient
light
had
not
been
thrown
on
certain
points
in
the
case
that
it
would
be
showing
too
much
haste
to
give
a
verdict
when
several
circumstances
were
still
wrapped
in
mystery
he
demanded
that
the
doctors
should
be
called
to
express
an
opinion
as
to
the
possibility
of
taking
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
s
evidence
he
pointed
out
that
the
most
important
in
fact
the
only
important
testimony
was
that
of
patience
and
that
patience
might
appear
any
day
and
prove
me
innocent
finally
he
demanded
that
they
should
order
a
search
to
be
made
for
the
mendicant
friar
whose
resemblance
to
the
mauprats
had
not
yet
been
explained
and
had
been
sworn
to
by
trustworthy
witnesses
in
his
opinion
it
was
essential
to
discover
what
had
become
of
antony
mauprat
and
to
call
upon
the
trappist
for
information
on
this
point
he
complained
bitterly
that
they
had
deprived
him
of
all
means
of
defence
by
refusing
any
delay
and
he
had
the
courage
to
assert
that
some
evil
passions
must
be
responsible
for
such
blind
haste
as
had
marked
the
conduct
of
this
trial
on
this
the
president
called
him
to
order
then
the
king
s
advocate
replied
triumphantly
that
all
formalities
had
been
fulfilled
that
the
court
was
sufficiently
enlightened
that
a
search
for
the
mendicant
friar
would
be
a
piece
of
folly
and
in
bad
taste
since
john
mauprat
had
proved
his
last
brother
s
death
which
had
taken
place
several
years
before
the
court
retired
to
deliberate
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
they
came
back
with
a
verdict
condemning
me
to
death
xxvi
although
the
haste
with
which
the
trial
had
been
conducted
and
the
severity
of
the
sentence
were
iniquitous
and
filled
those
who
were
most
bitter
against
me
with
amazement
i
received
the
blow
with
supreme
indifference
i
no
longer
felt
an
interest
in
anything
on
earth
i
commended
my
soul
and
the
vindication
of
my
memory
to
god
i
said
to
myself
that
if
edmee
died
i
should
find
her
again
in
a
better
world
that
if
she
survived
me
and
recovered
her
reason
she
would
one
day
succeed
in
discovering
the
truth
and
that
then
i
should
live
in
her
heart
as
a
dear
and
tender
memory
irritable
as
i
am
and
always
inclined
to
violence
in
the
case
of
anything
that
is
an
obstacle
or
an
offence
to
me
i
am
astonished
at
the
philosophical
resignation
and
the
proud
calm
i
have
shown
on
the
momentous
occasions
of
life
and
above
all
on
this
one
it
was
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
case
had
lasted
for
fourteen
hours
a
silence
as
of
death
reigned
over
the
court
which
was
as
full
and
as
attentive
as
at
the
beginning
so
fond
are
mortals
of
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
show
that
offered
by
the
criminal
court
at
this
moment
was
somewhat
dismal
those
men
in
red
robes
as
pale
and
stern
and
implacable
as
the
council
of
ten
at
venice
those
ghosts
of
women
decked
with
flowers
who
by
the
dim
light
of
the
tapers
looked
like
mere
reflections
of
life
hovering
in
the
galleries
above
the
priests
of
death
the
muskets
of
the
guard
glittering
in
the
gloom
in
the
back
of
the
court
the
attitude
of
my
poor
sergeant
who
had
fallen
at
my
feet
the
silent
but
vast
delight
of
the
trappist
still
standing
unwearied
near
the
bar
the
mournful
note
of
some
convent
bell
in
the
neighbourhood
beginning
to
ring
for
matins
amid
the
silence
of
the
assembly
was
not
all
this
enough
to
touch
the
nerves
of
the
wives
of
the
and
to
send
a
thrill
through
the
brawny
breasts
of
the
tanners
in
the
body
of
the
court
suddenly
just
as
the
court
was
about
to
disperse
a
figure
like
that
of
the
traditional
peasant
of
the
danube
squat
rugged
barefooted
with
a
long
beard
dishevelled
hair
a
broad
grave
brow
and
a
stern
commanding
glance
rose
in
the
midst
of
the
flickering
reflections
by
which
the
hall
was
half
lighted
and
standing
erect
before
the
bar
said
in
a
deep
striking
voice
i
jean
le
houx
known
as
patience
oppose
this
judgment
as
iniquitous
in
substance
and
illegal
in
form
i
demand
that
it
be
revised
so
that
i
may
give
my
evidence
which
is
necessary
may
be
of
sovereign
importance
and
should
have
been
waited
if
you
had
anything
to
say
cried
the
king
s
advocate
in
a
passion
why
did
you
not
present
yourself
when
you
were
summoned
you
are
imposing
on
the
court
by
pretending
that
you
have
important
evidence
to
and
you
answered
patience
more
slowly
and
in
an
even
deeper
tone
than
before
you
are
imposing
on
the
public
by
pretending
that
i
have
not
you
know
well
enough
that
i
must
remember
where
you
are
witness
and
to
whom
you
are
i
know
too
well
and
i
shall
not
say
too
much
i
hereby
declare
that
i
have
some
important
things
to
say
and
that
i
should
have
said
them
at
the
right
time
if
you
had
not
done
violence
to
the
time
i
wish
to
say
them
and
i
shall
and
believe
me
it
is
better
that
i
should
make
them
known
while
it
is
still
possible
to
revise
these
proceedings
it
is
even
better
for
the
judges
than
the
prisoner
for
the
one
comes
to
life
again
in
honour
as
soon
as
the
others
die
in
witness
said
the
irritated
magistrate
the
virulence
and
impertinence
of
your
language
will
be
prejudicial
rather
than
advantageous
to
the
and
who
says
that
i
am
favourable
to
the
prisoner
said
patience
in
a
voice
of
thunder
what
do
you
know
about
me
what
if
it
pleases
me
to
change
an
illegal
and
worthless
verdict
into
one
which
is
legal
and
irrevocable
but
how
can
you
reconcile
this
desire
to
see
the
laws
respected
said
the
magistrate
genuinely
moved
by
patience
s
powerful
personality
with
your
own
breach
of
them
in
not
appearing
when
summoned
by
the
public
prosecutor
i
did
not
wish
to
severe
penalties
may
be
inflicted
on
those
whose
wishes
are
not
in
harmony
with
the
laws
of
the
have
you
come
here
with
the
intention
of
submitting
to
them
i
have
come
to
see
that
you
respect
i
warn
you
that
if
you
do
not
change
your
tone
i
shall
have
you
taken
off
to
and
i
warn
you
that
if
you
love
justice
and
serve
god
you
will
listen
to
me
and
suspend
the
execution
of
this
sentence
it
is
not
for
him
who
brings
truth
to
humble
himself
before
those
who
should
be
seeking
it
but
you
who
are
listening
to
me
now
you
men
of
the
people
whom
i
will
not
accuse
the
great
of
wishing
to
dupe
you
whose
voice
is
called
the
voice
of
god
side
with
me
embrace
the
cause
of
truth
that
truth
which
is
in
danger
of
being
stifled
under
false
outward
shows
or
else
is
about
to
triumph
by
unfair
means
go
down
on
your
knees
you
men
of
the
people
my
brothers
my
children
pray
implore
require
that
justice
be
done
and
anger
repressed
it
is
your
duty
it
is
your
right
and
to
your
own
interest
for
it
is
you
who
are
insulted
and
threatened
when
laws
are
patience
spoke
with
so
much
warmth
and
his
sincerity
was
so
strikingly
manifest
that
a
thrill
of
sympathy
ran
through
the
whole
audience
at
that
time
philosophy
was
too
fashionable
with
the
young
men
of
quality
for
these
not
to
be
among
the
first
to
respond
to
an
appeal
though
addressed
to
others
than
themselves
they
rose
with
chivalrous
enthusiasm
and
turned
round
to
the
people
who
carried
away
by
their
noble
example
rose
likewise
there
was
a
wild
uproar
and
one
and
all
conscious
of
their
dignity
and
power
cast
away
personal
prejudices
in
order
to
combine
for
their
common
rights
thus
a
noble
impetuosity
and
a
true
word
are
sometimes
sufficient
to
bring
back
the
masses
who
have
long
been
led
astray
by
sophism
a
respite
was
granted
and
i
was
led
back
to
my
prison
amid
the
applause
of
the
people
marcasse
followed
me
patience
disappeared
without
giving
me
a
chance
to
thank
him
the
revision
of
the
sentence
could
not
be
made
without
an
order
from
the
high
court
for
my
own
part
before
the
verdict
was
given
i
had
resolved
to
make
no
appeal
to
this
court
of
cassation
of
the
old
jurisprudence
but
patience
s
bearing
and
words
had
had
as
much
effect
on
my
mind
as
on
the
minds
of
the
spectators
the
spirit
of
resistance
and
the
sense
of
human
dignity
dulled
in
me
and
paralyzed
as
it
were
by
grief
suddenly
awoke
again
and
in
this
hour
i
realized
that
man
is
not
made
for
that
selfish
concentration
of
despair
which
is
known
as
resignation
or
stoicism
no
man
can
cease
to
have
a
regard
for
his
own
honour
without
at
the
same
time
ceasing
to
feel
the
respect
due
to
the
principle
of
honour
if
it
is
grand
to
sacrifice
personal
glory
and
life
to
the
mysterious
decrees
of
conscience
it
is
cowardly
to
abandon
both
to
the
fury
of
an
unjust
persecution
i
felt
that
i
had
risen
in
my
own
estimation
and
i
passed
the
rest
of
this
momentous
night
in
devising
means
of
vindicating
myself
with
as
much
persistence
as
i
had
previously
displayed
in
abandoning
myself
to
fate
with
this
feeling
of
energy
i
could
feel
hope
springing
up
anew
edmee
perhaps
was
neither
mad
nor
mortally
wounded
she
might
acquit
me
she
might
recover
who
knows
i
said
to
myself
perhaps
she
has
already
done
me
justice
perhaps
it
was
she
who
sent
patience
to
my
rescue
undoubtedly
i
shall
best
please
her
by
taking
courage
again
and
not
letting
myself
be
crushed
by
a
set
of
but
how
was
i
to
obtain
this
order
from
the
high
court
it
needed
a
special
mandate
from
the
king
who
would
procure
this
who
would
cut
short
those
odious
delays
which
the
law
can
introduce
at
will
into
the
very
cases
that
it
has
previously
hurried
on
with
blind
precipitation
who
would
prevent
my
enemies
from
injuring
me
and
paralyzing
all
my
efforts
in
a
word
who
would
fight
for
me
the
abbe
alone
could
have
taken
up
my
cause
but
he
was
already
in
prison
on
my
account
his
generous
behaviour
in
the
trial
had
proved
that
he
was
still
my
friend
but
his
zeal
was
now
fettered
and
what
could
marcasse
do
hampered
by
his
humble
birth
and
enigmatical
language
evening
came
and
i
fell
asleep
in
the
hope
that
help
would
be
sent
from
on
high
for
i
had
prayed
to
god
with
my
whole
soul
a
few
hours
of
sleep
refreshed
me
i
was
aroused
by
the
noise
of
bolts
being
drawn
at
the
other
side
of
my
door
o
god
of
goodness
what
was
my
delight
on
seeing
arthur
my
brother
in
arms
my
other
self
the
man
from
whom
i
had
had
no
secret
for
six
long
years
i
wept
like
a
child
on
receiving
this
mark
of
love
from
providence
arthur
did
not
believe
me
guilty
scientific
matters
connected
with
the
library
at
philadelphia
had
taken
him
to
paris
where
he
had
heard
of
this
sad
affair
in
which
i
was
implicated
he
had
broken
a
lance
with
all
who
attacked
me
and
had
not
lost
a
moment
in
coming
to
offer
help
or
consolation
in
a
transport
of
joy
i
poured
out
my
soul
to
him
and
then
explained
how
he
could
assist
me
he
wanted
to
take
the
coach
for
paris
that
very
evening
but
i
implored
him
to
go
to
first
of
all
to
get
news
of
edmee
four
mortal
days
had
passed
since
i
had
received
any
and
moreover
marcasse
had
never
given
me
such
exact
details
as
i
could
have
wished
ease
your
mind
said
arthur
i
will
undertake
to
bring
you
the
truth
i
am
a
pretty
good
surgeon
and
i
have
a
practised
eye
i
shall
be
able
to
give
you
some
idea
of
what
you
have
to
hope
or
fear
from
i
shall
go
straight
to
two
days
later
i
received
a
long
letter
from
him
giving
full
details
about
edmee
her
condition
was
extraordinary
she
did
not
speak
nor
did
she
appear
to
be
in
pain
as
long
as
nothing
happened
to
excite
her
nerves
but
on
the
first
word
which
stirred
up
recollections
of
her
troubles
she
would
be
seized
with
convulsions
her
moral
isolation
formed
the
greatest
obstacle
to
recovery
physically
she
wanted
for
nothing
she
had
two
good
doctors
and
a
most
devoted
nurse
mademoiselle
leblanc
likewise
was
very
zealous
in
her
attentions
though
this
dangerous
woman
often
gave
her
pain
by
untimely
remarks
and
indiscreet
questions
furthermore
arthur
assured
me
that
if
ever
edmee
had
thought
me
guilty
and
had
expressed
an
opinion
on
this
point
it
must
have
been
in
some
previous
phase
of
her
illness
for
during
the
last
fortnight
at
least
she
had
been
in
a
state
of
complete
torpor
she
would
frequently
doze
but
without
quite
falling
asleep
she
could
take
liquid
food
and
jellies
nor
did
she
ever
complain
when
her
doctors
questioned
her
about
her
sufferings
she
answered
by
careless
signs
and
always
negatively
and
she
would
never
give
any
indication
that
she
remembered
the
affections
which
had
filled
her
life
her
love
for
her
father
however
that
feeling
which
had
always
been
so
deep
and
powerful
in
her
was
not
extinct
she
would
often
shed
copious
tears
but
at
such
a
time
she
seemed
to
be
deaf
to
all
sounds
in
vain
would
they
try
to
make
her
understand
that
her
father
was
not
dead
as
she
appeared
to
believe
with
a
gesture
of
entreaty
she
would
beg
them
to
stop
not
the
noise
for
that
did
not
seem
to
strike
her
ear
but
the
bustle
that
was
going
on
around
her
then
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
lying
back
in
her
and
bringing
her
knees
up
almost
to
her
breast
she
would
apparently
give
way
to
inconsolable
despair
this
silent
grief
which
could
no
longer
control
itself
and
no
longer
wished
to
be
controlled
this
powerful
will
which
had
once
been
able
to
quell
the
most
violent
storms
and
now
going
adrift
on
a
dead
sea
and
in
an
unruffled
calm
this
said
arthur
was
the
most
painful
spectacle
he
had
ever
beheld
edmee
seemed
to
wish
to
have
done
with
life
mademoiselle
leblanc
in
order
to
test
her
and
arouse
her
had
brutally
taken
upon
herself
to
announce
that
her
father
was
dead
she
had
replied
by
a
sign
that
she
knew
a
few
hours
later
the
doctors
had
tried
to
make
her
understand
that
he
was
alive
she
had
replied
by
another
sign
that
she
did
not
believe
them
they
had
wheeled
the
chevalier
s
into
her
room
they
had
brought
father
and
daughter
face
to
face
and
the
two
had
not
recognised
each
other
only
after
a
few
moments
edmee
taking
her
father
for
a
ghost
had
uttered
piercing
cries
and
had
been
seized
with
convulsions
that
had
opened
one
of
her
wounds
again
and
made
the
doctors
tremble
for
her
life
since
then
they
had
taken
care
to
keep
the
two
apart
and
never
to
breathe
a
word
about
the
chevalier
in
edmee
s
presence
she
had
taken
arthur
for
one
of
the
doctors
of
the
district
and
had
received
him
with
the
same
sweetness
and
the
same
indifference
as
the
others
he
had
not
dared
to
speak
to
her
about
me
but
he
extorted
me
not
to
despair
there
was
nothing
in
edmee
s
condition
that
time
and
rest
could
not
triumph
over
there
was
but
little
fever
left
none
of
her
vital
organs
were
really
affected
her
wounds
were
almost
healed
and
it
did
not
seem
as
if
her
brain
were
in
such
an
excited
condition
that
it
would
be
permanently
deranged
the
weak
state
of
her
mind
and
the
prostration
of
all
the
other
organs
could
not
according
to
arthur
long
withstand
the
vitality
of
youth
and
the
recuperative
power
of
an
admirable
constitution
finally
he
advised
me
to
think
of
myself
i
might
help
towards
her
recovery
and
i
might
again
find
happiness
in
her
affection
and
esteem
in
a
fortnight
arthur
returned
from
paris
with
an
order
from
the
king
for
the
revision
of
my
sentence
fresh
witnesses
were
heard
patience
did
not
appear
but
i
received
a
note
from
him
containing
these
words
in
a
shapeless
hand
you
are
not
guilty
so
don
t
the
doctors
declared
that
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
might
be
examined
without
danger
but
that
her
answers
would
have
no
meaning
she
was
now
in
better
health
she
had
recognised
her
father
and
at
present
would
never
leave
him
but
she
could
understand
nothing
that
was
not
connected
with
him
she
seemed
to
derive
great
pleasure
from
tending
him
like
a
child
and
on
his
side
the
chevalier
would
now
and
then
recognise
his
beloved
daughter
but
his
vital
powers
were
visibly
decaying
they
questioned
him
in
one
of
his
lucid
moments
he
replied
that
his
daughter
had
indeed
fallen
from
her
horse
while
hunting
and
that
she
had
torn
her
breast
on
the
stump
of
a
tree
but
that
not
a
soul
had
fired
at
her
even
by
mistake
and
that
only
a
madman
could
possibly
believe
her
cousin
capable
of
such
a
crime
this
was
all
the
information
they
could
draw
from
him
when
they
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
his
nephew
s
absence
he
answered
that
his
nephew
was
still
in
the
house
and
that
he
saw
him
every
day
was
it
that
in
his
devotion
to
the
good
name
of
a
family
alas
so
compromised
he
thought
to
defeat
the
aims
of
justice
by
childish
lies
this
is
a
point
i
was
never
able
to
ascertain
as
for
edmee
it
was
impossible
to
examine
her
at
the
first
question
that
was
asked
her
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
made
a
sign
that
she
did
not
wish
to
be
bothered
as
the
public
prosecutor
insisted
and
became
more
explicit
she
stared
at
him
and
seemed
to
be
making
an
effort
to
understand
he
pronounced
my
name
she
gave
a
loud
cry
and
fainted
he
had
to
abandon
all
thoughts
of
taking
her
evidence
however
arthur
did
not
despair
on
the
contrary
the
account
of
this
scene
made
him
think
that
edmee
s
mental
faculties
might
be
about
to
take
a
favourable
turn
he
immediately
returned
to
where
he
remained
several
days
without
writing
to
me
which
caused
me
great
anxiety
when
the
abbe
was
questioned
again
he
persisted
in
his
calm
laconic
refusal
to
give
evidence
my
judges
seeing
that
the
information
promised
by
patience
was
not
forthcoming
hurried
on
the
revision
of
the
trial
and
by
another
exhibition
of
haste
gave
another
proof
of
their
animosity
the
appointed
day
arrived
i
was
devoured
by
anxiety
arthur
had
written
me
to
keep
up
my
courage
in
as
laconic
a
style
as
patience
my
counsel
had
been
unable
to
obtain
any
fresh
evidence
in
my
favour
i
could
see
clearly
that
he
was
beginning
to
believe
me
guilty
all
he
hoped
for
was
to
obtain
a
further
delay
xxvii
there
were
even
more
people
present
than
at
the
first
trial
the
guard
were
forced
back
to
the
doors
of
the
court
and
the
crowd
occupied
every
available
space
even
to
the
windows
of
the
mansion
of
jacques
coeur
the
of
the
present
day
i
was
much
agitated
this
time
though
i
had
strength
and
pride
enough
not
to
let
it
be
seen
i
was
now
interested
in
the
success
of
my
case
and
as
it
seemed
as
if
my
hopes
were
not
to
be
realized
i
experienced
an
indescribable
feeling
of
uneasiness
a
sort
of
suppressed
rage
a
bitter
hatred
of
these
men
who
would
not
open
their
eyes
to
my
innocence
and
even
of
god
who
seemed
to
have
deserted
me
in
this
state
of
agitation
i
had
to
make
such
violent
efforts
to
appear
calm
that
i
scarcely
noticed
what
was
happening
around
me
i
recovered
sufficient
presence
of
mind
when
my
fresh
examination
took
place
to
answer
in
the
same
terms
as
at
the
first
trial
then
a
black
veil
seemed
to
fall
over
my
head
an
iron
ring
gripped
my
brow
the
sockets
of
my
eyes
went
icily
cold
i
could
see
nothing
but
myself
hear
nothing
but
vague
unintelligible
sounds
i
do
not
know
what
actually
took
place
i
do
not
know
if
any
one
announced
the
apparition
which
suddenly
appeared
before
me
i
only
remember
that
a
door
opened
behind
the
judges
and
that
arthur
came
forward
leading
a
veiled
woman
that
he
took
off
her
veil
after
making
her
sit
down
in
a
big
which
the
ushers
eagerly
wheeled
toward
her
and
that
a
cry
of
admiration
rang
through
the
hall
when
edmee
s
pale
sublime
beauty
was
revealed
at
this
moment
i
forgot
the
crowd
and
the
judges
and
my
cause
and
the
whole
universe
i
believe
that
no
human
power
could
have
withstood
my
wild
rush
i
dashed
like
a
thunderbolt
into
the
middle
of
the
inclosure
and
falling
at
edmee
s
feet
i
showered
kisses
on
her
knees
i
have
been
told
that
this
act
won
over
the
public
and
that
nearly
all
the
ladies
burst
into
tears
the
young
dandies
did
not
venture
to
laugh
the
judges
were
affected
and
for
a
moment
truth
was
completely
triumphant
edmee
looked
at
me
for
some
time
her
face
was
as
expressionless
as
the
face
of
death
it
did
not
seem
as
if
she
could
ever
recognise
me
the
spectators
were
waiting
in
profound
silence
for
her
to
show
some
sign
of
hatred
or
affection
for
me
all
at
once
she
burst
into
tears
threw
her
arms
around
my
neck
and
then
lost
consciousness
arthur
had
her
carried
out
immediately
he
had
some
trouble
in
making
me
return
to
my
place
i
could
not
remember
where
i
was
or
the
issues
that
were
at
stake
i
clung
to
edmee
s
dress
and
only
wanted
to
follow
her
arthur
addressed
the
court
and
requested
that
the
doctors
who
had
examined
edmee
in
the
morning
might
again
pronounce
upon
the
state
of
her
health
he
likewise
demanded
that
she
should
be
recalled
to
give
evidence
and
to
be
confronted
with
me
as
soon
as
she
recovered
from
the
attack
this
attack
is
not
serious
he
said
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
has
had
several
of
the
same
kind
during
the
last
few
days
and
on
her
way
here
after
each
her
mental
faculties
have
taken
a
more
and
more
favourable
go
and
attend
to
the
invalid
said
the
president
she
shall
be
recalled
in
two
hours
if
you
think
she
will
have
recovered
from
her
swoon
by
then
meanwhile
the
court
will
hear
the
witness
on
whose
demand
the
first
sentence
was
not
carried
arthur
withdrew
and
patience
was
introduced
he
was
dressed
quite
neatly
but
after
saying
a
few
words
he
declared
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
continue
unless
they
allowed
him
to
take
off
his
coat
this
borrowed
finery
so
embarrassed
him
and
seemed
so
heavy
that
he
was
perspiring
profusely
no
sooner
did
the
president
make
a
sign
of
consent
accompanied
by
a
smile
of
scorn
than
he
threw
to
the
ground
this
badge
of
civilization
then
after
carefully
pulling
down
his
over
his
sinewy
arms
he
spoke
almost
as
follows
i
will
speak
the
truth
the
whole
truth
i
take
the
oath
for
the
second
time
for
i
have
to
speak
of
things
that
seem
contradictory
things
that
i
can
not
explain
to
myself
i
swear
before
god
and
man
that
i
will
say
what
i
know
and
as
i
know
it
without
being
influenced
for
or
against
any
he
lifted
his
big
hand
and
turned
round
towards
the
people
with
a
simple
confidence
as
if
to
say
you
can
all
see
that
i
am
taking
an
oath
and
you
know
that
i
am
to
be
this
confidence
of
his
was
not
since
the
incident
in
the
first
trial
the
public
mind
had
been
much
occupied
about
this
extraordinary
man
who
had
spoken
before
the
court
with
so
much
daring
and
harangued
the
people
in
presence
of
the
judges
his
conduct
had
filled
all
the
democrats
and
with
great
curiosity
and
sympathy
the
works
of
beaumarchais
were
very
fashionable
among
the
upper
classes
and
this
will
explain
how
it
was
that
patience
though
opposed
to
all
the
authorities
in
the
province
yet
found
himself
supported
and
applauded
by
every
man
who
prided
himself
on
his
intelligence
they
all
thought
they
saw
in
him
figaro
under
a
new
form
the
fame
of
his
private
virtues
had
spread
for
you
remember
that
during
my
stay
in
america
patience
had
made
himself
known
among
the
people
of
varenne
and
had
exchanged
his
sorcerer
s
reputation
for
that
of
a
public
benefactor
they
had
given
him
the
title
of
the
because
he
was
always
ready
to
intervene
in
disputes
and
would
always
settle
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
sides
with
admirable
and
tact
this
time
he
spoke
in
a
high
penetrating
voice
it
was
a
rich
voice
of
wide
compass
his
gestures
were
quiet
or
animated
according
to
the
circumstances
but
always
dignified
and
impressive
the
expression
on
his
short
socratic
face
was
never
anything
but
fine
he
had
all
the
qualities
of
an
orator
but
there
was
no
vanity
in
his
display
of
them
he
spoke
in
the
plain
concise
style
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
acquire
in
his
recent
intercourse
with
men
in
discussions
about
their
practical
interests
when
mademoiselle
de
mauprat
was
shot
he
said
i
was
not
more
than
a
dozen
paces
from
her
but
the
brushwood
at
that
spot
is
so
thick
that
i
could
not
see
more
than
two
paces
in
front
of
me
they
had
persuaded
me
to
take
part
in
the
hunt
but
it
gave
me
but
little
pleasure
finding
myself
near
gazeau
tower
where
i
lived
for
some
twenty
years
i
felt
an
inclination
to
see
my
old
cell
again
and
i
was
bearing
down
upon
it
at
a
great
pace
when
i
heard
a
shot
that
did
not
frighten
me
in
the
least
it
seemed
but
natural
that
there
should
be
some
gun
fired
during
a
battue
but
when
i
got
through
the
thicket
that
is
to
day
some
two
minutes
later
i
found
edmee
excuse
me
i
generally
call
her
by
this
name
i
am
so
to
speak
a
sort
of
to
her
i
found
edmee
on
her
knees
upon
the
ground
wounded
as
you
have
been
told
and
still
holding
the
bridle
of
her
horse
which
was
rearing
she
did
not
know
whether
she
was
seriously
or
slightly
wounded
but
she
had
her
other
hand
on
her
breast
and
she
was
saying
bernard
this
is
hideous
i
should
never
have
thought
that
you
would
kill
me
bernard
where
are
you
come
and
see
me
die
this
will
kill
father
as
she
said
this
she
let
go
the
horse
s
bridle
and
fell
to
the
ground
i
rushed
towards
her
ah
you
saw
it
patience
she
said
do
not
speak
about
it
do
not
tell
my
father
she
threw
out
her
arms
and
her
body
became
rigid
i
thought
that
she
was
dead
she
spoke
no
more
until
night
after
they
had
extracted
the
bullets
from
her
did
you
then
see
bernard
de
mauprat
i
saw
him
on
the
spot
where
the
deed
was
done
just
as
edmee
lost
consciousness
and
seemed
to
be
giving
up
her
soul
he
seemed
to
be
out
of
his
mind
i
thought
that
he
was
overwhelmed
with
remorse
i
spoke
to
him
sternly
and
treated
him
as
a
murderer
he
made
no
reply
but
sat
down
on
the
ground
by
his
cousin
s
side
he
remained
there
in
a
dazed
condition
even
a
long
time
after
they
had
taken
her
away
no
one
thought
of
accusing
him
the
people
thought
that
he
had
had
a
fall
because
they
saw
his
horse
trotting
by
the
side
of
the
pond
they
believed
that
his
carbine
had
gone
off
as
he
fell
the
abbe
aubert
was
the
only
one
who
heard
me
accuse
bernard
of
having
murdered
his
cousin
during
the
days
that
followed
edmee
spoke
occasionally
but
it
was
not
always
in
my
presence
besides
at
this
time
she
was
nearly
always
delirious
i
maintain
that
she
told
nobody
and
least
of
all
mademoiselle
leblanc
what
had
passed
between
herself
and
de
mauprat
before
the
gun
was
fired
nor
did
she
confide
this
to
me
any
more
than
others
on
the
rare
occasions
when
she
was
in
possession
of
her
senses
she
would
say
in
answer
to
our
questions
that
bernard
had
certainly
not
done
it
on
purpose
and
several
times
during
the
first
three
days
she
even
asked
to
see
him
however
when
she
was
delirious
she
would
sometimes
cry
bernard
bernard
you
have
committed
a
great
crime
you
have
killed
my
father
that
was
her
idea
she
used
really
to
think
that
her
father
was
dead
and
she
thought
so
for
a
long
time
very
little
therefore
of
what
she
said
is
to
be
taken
seriously
the
words
that
mademoiselle
leblanc
has
put
into
her
mouth
are
false
after
three
days
she
ceased
to
talk
intelligibly
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
she
ceased
to
speak
altogether
when
she
recovered
her
reason
about
a
week
ago
she
sent
away
mademoiselle
leblanc
which
would
clearly
show
that
she
had
some
ground
for
disliking
her
maid
that
is
what
i
have
to
say
against
de
mauprat
it
rested
entirely
with
myself
to
keep
silent
but
having
other
things
to
say
yet
i
wished
to
make
known
the
whole
patience
paused
awhile
the
public
and
the
judges
themselves
who
were
beginning
to
take
an
interest
in
me
and
lose
the
bitterness
of
their
prejudices
were
apparently
thunderstruck
at
hearing
evidence
so
different
from
what
they
expected
patience
continued
as
follows
for
several
weeks
i
remained
convinced
of
bernard
s
guilt
but
i
was
pondering
over
the
matter
the
while
i
frequently
said
to
myself
that
a
man
as
good
and
clever
as
bernard
a
man
for
whom
edmee
felt
so
much
esteem
and
whom
le
chevalier
loved
like
a
son
a
man
in
short
so
deeply
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
justice
and
truth
could
not
between
one
day
and
the
next
turn
into
a
scoundrel
then
the
idea
came
into
my
head
that
after
all
it
might
have
been
some
other
mauprat
who
fired
the
shot
i
do
not
speak
of
the
one
who
has
become
a
trappist
he
added
looking
among
the
audience
for
jean
de
mauprat
who
however
was
not
there
i
speak
of
the
man
whose
death
has
never
been
proved
although
the
court
thought
fit
to
overlook
this
and
to
accept
jean
de
mauprat
s
witness
said
the
president
i
must
remind
you
that
you
are
not
here
to
serve
as
counsel
for
the
prisoner
or
to
criticise
the
decisions
of
this
court
you
must
confine
yourself
to
a
statement
of
facts
and
not
express
your
opinion
on
the
question
at
very
well
replied
patience
i
must
however
explain
why
i
did
not
wish
to
appear
at
the
first
trial
seeing
that
the
only
evidence
i
had
was
against
bernard
and
that
i
could
not
trust
that
evidence
you
are
not
asked
to
explain
this
at
present
please
keep
to
your
one
moment
i
have
my
honour
to
defend
i
have
to
explain
my
own
conduct
if
you
you
are
not
the
prisoner
you
are
not
here
to
plead
your
own
cause
if
the
court
thinks
right
to
prosecute
you
for
contempt
you
can
see
to
your
own
defence
but
there
is
no
question
of
that
i
beg
your
pardon
the
question
is
for
me
to
let
the
court
see
whether
i
am
an
honest
man
or
a
false
witness
it
would
seem
that
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
case
the
prisoner
s
life
depends
on
it
the
court
can
not
consider
that
a
matter
of
proceed
said
the
king
s
advocate
and
try
to
remember
the
respect
you
owe
to
the
i
have
no
wish
to
offend
the
court
replied
patience
i
would
merely
observe
that
a
man
may
refuse
to
submit
to
the
orders
of
the
court
from
conscientious
motives
which
the
court
can
legally
condemn
but
which
each
judge
personally
can
understand
and
excuse
i
say
then
that
i
could
not
persuade
myself
of
bernard
de
mauprat
s
guilt
my
ears
alone
knew
of
it
this
was
not
enough
for
me
pardon
me
gentlemen
i
too
am
a
judge
make
inquiries
about
me
in
my
village
they
call
me
the
great
when
my
ask
me
to
decide
some
tavern
dispute
or
the
boundary
of
some
field
i
do
not
so
much
listen
to
their
opinions
as
my
own
in
judging
a
man
one
must
take
account
of
more
than
a
single
little
act
many
previous
ones
will
help
to
show
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
last
that
is
imputed
to
him
thus
being
unable
to
believe
that
bernard
was
a
murderer
and
having
heard
more
than
a
dozen
people
whom
i
consider
incapable
of
giving
false
evidence
testify
to
the
fact
that
a
monk
bearing
a
resemblance
to
the
mauprats
had
been
prowling
about
the
country
and
having
myself
seen
this
monk
s
back
and
habit
as
he
was
passing
through
pouligny
on
the
morning
of
the
event
i
wished
to
discover
if
he
was
in
varenne
and
i
learnt
that
he
was
still
there
that
is
to
say
after
leaving
it
he
had
returned
about
the
time
of
the
trial
last
month
and
what
is
more
i
learnt
that
he
was
acquainted
with
john
mauprat
who
can
this
monk
be
i
asked
myself
why
does
the
very
sight
of
him
frighten
all
the
people
in
the
country
what
is
he
doing
in
varenne
if
he
belongs
to
the
carmelite
convent
why
does
he
not
wear
their
habit
if
he
is
of
the
same
order
as
john
why
is
he
not
staying
with
him
at
the
carmelites
if
he
is
collecting
money
why
after
making
a
collection
in
one
place
does
he
not
move
on
to
another
instead
of
returning
and
bothering
people
who
have
given
him
money
only
the
day
before
if
he
is
a
trappist
and
does
not
want
to
stay
with
the
carmelites
like
the
other
why
does
he
not
go
back
to
his
own
convent
what
is
this
wandering
monk
and
how
does
john
mauprat
who
has
told
several
people
that
he
does
not
know
him
know
him
so
well
that
they
lunch
together
from
time
to
time
in
a
tavern
at
crevant
i
made
up
my
mind
then
to
give
evidence
though
it
might
in
a
measure
do
harm
to
bernard
so
as
to
be
able
to
say
what
i
am
now
saying
even
if
it
should
be
of
no
use
but
as
you
never
allow
witnesses
sufficient
time
to
try
to
verify
what
they
have
reason
to
believe
i
started
off
immediately
for
my
woods
where
i
live
like
the
foxes
with
a
determination
not
to
quit
them
until
i
had
discovered
what
this
monk
was
doing
in
the
country
so
i
put
myself
on
his
track
and
i
have
discovered
who
he
is
he
is
the
murderer
of
edmee
de
mauprat
his
name
is
antony
this
revelation
caused
a
great
stir
on
the
bench
and
among
the
public
every
one
looked
around
for
john
mauprat
whose
face
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
what
proof
have
you
of
this
said
the
president
i
am
about
to
tell
you
replied
patience
having
learnt
from
the
landlady
at
crevant
to
whom
i
have
occasionally
been
of
some
assistance
that
the
two
trappists
used
to
lunch
at
her
tavern
from
time
to
time
as
i
have
said
i
went
and
took
up
my
abode
about
half
a
league
from
here
in
a
hermitage
known
as
le
trou
aux
fades
situated
in
the
middle
of
the
woods
and
open
to
the
first
comer
furniture
and
all
it
is
a
cave
in
the
rock
containing
a
seat
in
the
shape
of
a
big
stone
and
nothing
else
i
lived
there
for
a
couple
of
days
on
roots
and
bits
of
bread
that
they
occasionally
brought
me
from
the
tavern
it
is
against
my
principles
to
live
in
a
tavern
on
the
third
day
the
landlady
s
little
boy
came
and
informed
me
that
the
two
monks
were
about
to
sit
down
to
a
meal
i
hastened
back
and
hid
myself
in
a
cellar
which
opens
into
the
garden
the
door
of
this
cellar
is
quite
close
to
the
under
which
these
gentlemen
were
taking
luncheon
in
the
open
air
john
was
sober
the
other
was
eating
like
a
carmelite
and
drinking
like
a
franciscan
i
could
hear
and
see
everything
at
my
ease
there
must
be
an
end
of
this
antony
was
saying
i
easily
recognised
the
man
when
i
saw
him
drink
and
heard
him
swear
i
am
tired
of
playing
this
game
for
you
hide
me
away
with
the
carmelites
or
i
shall
make
a
and
what
row
can
you
make
that
will
not
bring
you
to
the
gallows
you
clumsy
fool
answered
john
it
is
very
certain
that
you
will
not
set
foot
inside
the
monastery
i
don
t
want
to
find
myself
mixed
up
in
a
criminal
trial
for
they
would
discover
what
you
are
in
an
hour
or
and
why
i
should
like
to
know
you
make
them
all
believe
that
you
are
a
saint
because
i
know
how
to
behave
like
a
saint
whereas
you
you
behave
like
a
fool
why
you
can
t
stop
swearing
for
an
hour
and
you
would
be
breaking
all
the
mugs
after
dinner
i
say
nepomucene
rejoined
the
other
do
you
fancy
that
you
would
get
off
if
i
were
caught
and
tried
why
not
answered
the
trappist
i
had
no
hand
in
your
folly
nor
did
i
advise
anything
of
this
ha
ha
my
fine
apostle
cried
antony
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
in
a
fit
of
laughter
you
are
glad
enough
about
it
now
that
it
is
done
you
were
always
a
coward
and
had
it
not
been
for
me
you
would
never
have
thought
of
anything
better
than
getting
yourself
made
a
trappist
to
ape
devotion
and
afterward
get
absolution
for
the
past
so
as
to
have
a
right
to
draw
a
little
money
from
the
headbreakers
of
by
jove
a
mighty
fine
ambition
to
give
up
the
ghost
under
a
monk
s
cowl
after
leading
a
pretty
poor
life
and
only
tasting
half
its
sweets
let
alone
hiding
like
a
mole
come
now
when
they
have
hung
my
pretty
bernard
and
the
lovely
edmonde
is
dead
and
when
the
old
has
given
back
his
big
bones
to
the
earth
when
we
have
inherited
all
that
pretty
fortune
yonder
you
will
own
that
we
have
done
a
capital
stroke
of
business
three
at
a
blow
it
would
cost
me
rather
too
much
to
play
the
saint
seeing
that
convent
ways
are
not
quite
my
ways
and
that
i
don
t
know
how
to
wear
the
habit
so
i
shall
throw
the
cowl
to
the
winds
and
content
myself
with
building
a
chapel
at
and
taking
the
sacrament
four
times
a
everything
you
have
done
in
this
matter
is
stupid
and
bless
my
soul
don
t
talk
of
infamy
my
sweet
brother
or
i
shall
make
you
swallow
this
bottle
i
say
that
it
is
a
piece
of
folly
and
if
it
succeeds
you
ought
to
burn
a
fine
candle
to
the
virgin
if
it
does
not
succeed
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
business
do
you
hear
after
i
had
been
in
hiding
in
the
secret
passage
in
the
keep
and
had
heard
bernard
telling
his
valet
after
supper
that
he
was
going
out
of
his
mind
on
account
of
the
beautiful
edmee
i
happened
to
throw
out
a
suggestion
that
there
might
be
a
chance
here
of
doing
a
good
stroke
of
business
and
like
a
fool
you
took
the
matter
seriously
and
without
consulting
me
or
waiting
for
a
favourable
moment
you
went
and
did
a
deed
that
should
have
been
thought
over
and
properly
a
favourable
moment
that
you
are
how
the
deuce
was
i
to
get
one
opportunity
makes
the
i
find
myself
surprised
by
the
hunt
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
i
go
and
hide
in
that
cursed
gazeau
tower
i
see
my
coming
i
overhear
a
conversation
that
might
make
one
die
of
laughing
and
see
bernard
blubbering
and
the
girl
playing
the
haughty
beauty
bernard
goes
off
like
an
idiot
without
showing
himself
a
man
i
find
on
me
god
knows
how
a
rascally
pistol
already
loaded
bang
hold
your
tongue
you
wild
brute
said
the
other
quite
frightened
do
you
think
a
tavern
is
the
proper
place
to
talk
of
these
things
keep
that
tongue
quiet
you
wretched
creature
or
i
will
never
see
you
and
yet
you
will
have
to
see
me
sweet
brother
mine
when
i
go
and
ring
the
bell
at
the
gate
of
the
carmelite
if
you
come
i
will
denounce
you
will
not
denounce
me
for
i
know
too
much
about
i
am
not
afraid
i
have
given
proofs
of
my
repentance
i
have
expiated
my
hypocrite
come
now
hold
your
tongue
you
madman
said
the
other
i
must
leave
you
there
is
some
that
all
what
do
you
expect
from
a
monk
do
you
imagine
that
i
am
rich
your
carmelites
are
and
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
i
might
give
you
more
but
i
would
rather
not
as
soon
as
you
got
a
couple
of
louis
you
would
be
off
for
a
debauch
and
make
enough
row
to
betray
and
if
you
want
me
to
quit
this
part
of
the
country
for
some
time
what
do
you
suppose
i
am
to
travel
with
three
times
already
i
have
given
you
enough
to
take
you
away
haven
t
i
and
each
time
you
have
come
back
after
drinking
it
all
in
the
first
place
of
on
the
frontier
of
the
province
your
impudence
sickens
me
after
the
evidence
given
against
you
when
the
police
are
on
the
watch
when
bernard
is
appealing
for
a
fresh
trial
you
may
be
caught
at
any
moment
that
is
for
you
to
see
to
brother
you
can
lead
the
carmelites
by
the
nose
and
the
carmelites
can
lead
the
bishop
through
some
little
peccadillo
i
suppose
done
together
on
the
quiet
in
the
convent
after
supper
here
the
president
interrupted
patience
witness
he
said
i
call
you
to
order
you
are
outraging
a
prelate
s
virtue
by
daring
to
retail
such
a
by
no
means
replied
patience
i
am
merely
reporting
a
drunkard
s
and
a
murderer
s
invectives
against
the
prelate
they
do
not
concern
me
in
the
least
and
every
one
here
knows
what
value
to
put
upon
them
but
if
you
wish
i
will
say
no
more
on
this
point
the
discussion
lasted
for
some
time
longer
the
real
trappist
wanted
to
make
the
sham
trappist
leave
the
country
and
the
latter
persisted
in
remaining
declaring
that
if
he
were
not
on
the
spot
his
brother
would
have
him
arrested
immediately
after
bernard
s
head
had
been
cut
off
so
that
he
might
have
the
whole
inheritance
to
himself
john
driven
to
extremities
seriously
threatened
to
denounce
him
and
hand
him
over
to
justice
enough
replied
antony
you
will
take
good
care
not
to
do
that
i
know
for
if
bernard
is
acquitted
to
the
inheritance
then
they
separated
the
real
trappist
went
away
looking
very
anxious
the
other
fell
asleep
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
i
left
my
to
take
steps
for
his
arrest
it
was
just
then
that
the
police
who
had
been
on
my
track
for
some
time
to
force
me
to
come
and
give
evidence
collared
me
in
vain
did
i
point
to
the
monk
as
edmee
s
murderer
they
would
not
believe
me
and
said
they
had
no
warrant
against
him
i
wanted
to
arouse
the
village
but
they
prevented
me
from
speaking
they
brought
me
here
from
station
to
station
as
if
i
had
been
a
deserter
and
for
the
last
week
i
have
been
in
the
cells
and
no
one
has
deigned
to
heed
my
protests
they
would
not
even
let
me
see
bernard
s
lawyer
or
inform
him
that
i
was
in
prison
it
was
only
just
now
that
the
jailer
came
and
told
me
that
i
must
put
on
my
coat
and
appear
in
court
i
do
not
know
whether
all
this
is
according
to
the
law
but
one
thing
is
certain
namely
that
the
murderer
might
have
been
arrested
and
has
not
been
nor
will
he
be
unless
you
secure
the
person
of
john
mauprat
to
prevent
him
from
warning
i
do
not
say
his
accomplice
but
his
i
state
on
oath
that
from
all
i
have
heard
john
mauprat
is
above
any
suspicion
of
complicity
as
to
the
act
of
allowing
an
innocent
man
to
be
handed
over
to
the
rigour
of
the
law
and
of
endeavouring
to
save
a
guilty
man
by
going
so
far
as
to
give
false
evidence
and
produce
false
documents
to
prove
his
death
patience
noticing
that
the
president
was
again
about
to
interrupt
him
hastened
to
end
his
testimony
by
saying
as
to
that
gentlemen
it
is
for
you
not
for
me
to
judge
xxviii
after
this
important
evidence
the
trial
was
suspended
for
a
few
minutes
when
the
judges
returned
edmee
was
brought
back
into
the
court
pale
and
weak
scarcely
able
to
drag
herself
to
the
which
was
reserved
for
her
she
nevertheless
displayed
considerable
mental
vigour
and
presence
of
mind
do
you
think
you
can
answer
the
questions
which
will
be
put
to
you
without
unduly
exciting
yourself
asked
the
president
i
hope
so
sir
she
replied
it
is
true
that
i
have
recently
been
seriously
ill
and
that
it
is
only
within
the
last
few
days
that
i
have
recovered
my
memory
but
i
believe
i
have
completely
recovered
it
and
my
mind
feels
quite
your
name
de
mauprat
she
added
in
an
undertone
i
shuddered
as
she
said
these
unseasonable
words
her
eyes
had
assumed
a
strange
expression
i
feared
that
her
mind
was
going
to
wander
still
further
my
counsel
was
also
alarmed
and
looked
at
me
inquiringly
no
one
but
myself
had
understood
these
two
words
which
edmee
had
been
in
the
habit
of
frequently
repeating
during
the
first
and
last
days
of
her
illness
happily
this
was
the
last
sign
of
any
disturbance
in
her
faculties
she
shook
her
beautiful
head
as
if
to
drive
out
any
troublesome
ideas
and
the
president
having
asked
her
for
an
explanation
of
these
unintelligible
words
she
replied
with
sweetness
and
dignity
it
is
nothing
sir
please
continue
my
your
age
mademoiselle
are
you
related
to
the
prisoner
he
is
my
second
cousin
and
my
father
s
do
you
swear
to
speak
the
truth
the
whole
truth
yes
raise
your
edmee
turned
towards
arthur
with
a
sad
smile
he
took
off
her
glove
and
helped
to
raise
her
arm
which
hung
nerveless
and
powerless
by
her
side
i
felt
big
tears
rolling
down
my
cheeks
with
delicacy
and
simplicity
edmee
related
how
she
and
i
had
lost
our
way
in
the
woods
how
i
under
the
impression
that
her
horse
had
bolted
had
unseated
her
in
my
eager
anxiety
to
stop
the
animal
how
a
slight
altercation
had
ensued
after
which
with
a
little
feminine
temper
foolish
enough
she
had
wished
to
mount
her
mare
again
without
help
how
she
had
even
spoken
unkindly
to
me
not
meaning
a
word
of
what
she
said
for
she
loved
me
like
a
brother
how
deeply
hurt
by
her
harshness
i
had
moved
away
a
few
yards
to
obey
her
and
how
just
as
she
was
about
to
follow
me
grieved
herself
at
our
childish
quarrel
she
had
felt
a
violent
shock
in
her
breast
and
had
fallen
almost
without
hearing
any
report
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
say
in
which
direction
she
was
looking
or
from
which
side
the
shot
had
come
that
is
all
that
happened
she
added
of
all
people
i
am
least
able
to
explain
this
occurrence
in
my
soul
and
conscience
i
can
only
attribute
it
to
the
carelessness
of
one
of
the
hunting
party
who
is
afraid
to
confess
laws
are
so
severe
and
it
is
so
difficult
to
prove
the
so
mademoiselle
you
do
not
think
that
your
cousin
was
the
author
of
this
attempt
no
sir
certainly
not
i
am
no
longer
delirious
and
i
should
not
have
let
myself
be
brought
before
you
if
i
had
felt
that
my
mind
was
at
all
apparently
then
you
consider
that
a
state
of
mental
aberration
was
responsible
for
the
revelations
you
made
to
patience
to
mademoiselle
leblanc
your
companion
and
also
perhaps
to
abbe
i
made
no
revelations
she
replied
emphatically
either
to
the
worthy
patience
the
venerable
abbe
or
my
servant
leblanc
if
the
meaningless
words
we
utter
in
a
state
of
delirium
are
to
be
called
revelations
all
the
people
who
frighten
us
in
our
dreams
would
have
to
be
condemned
to
death
how
could
i
have
revealed
facts
of
which
i
never
had
any
knowledge
but
at
the
time
you
received
the
wound
and
fell
from
your
horse
you
said
bernard
bernard
i
should
never
have
thought
that
you
would
kill
me
i
do
not
remember
having
said
so
and
even
if
i
did
i
can
not
conceive
that
any
one
would
attach
much
importance
to
the
impressions
of
a
person
who
had
suddenly
been
struck
to
the
ground
and
whose
mind
was
annihilated
as
it
were
all
that
i
know
is
that
bernard
de
mauprat
would
lay
down
his
life
for
my
father
or
myself
which
does
not
make
it
very
probable
that
he
wanted
to
murder
me
great
god
what
would
be
his
object
in
order
to
embarrass
edmee
the
president
now
utilized
all
the
arguments
which
could
be
drawn
from
mademoiselle
leblanc
s
evidence
as
a
fact
they
were
calculated
to
cause
her
not
a
little
confusion
edmee
who
was
at
first
somewhat
astonished
to
find
that
the
law
was
in
possession
of
so
many
details
which
she
believed
were
unknown
to
others
regained
her
courage
and
pride
however
when
they
suggested
in
those
brutally
chaste
terms
which
are
used
by
the
law
in
such
a
case
that
she
had
been
a
victim
of
my
violence
at
her
spirit
thoroughly
roused
she
proceeded
to
defend
my
character
and
her
own
honour
and
declared
that
considering
how
i
had
been
brought
up
i
had
behaved
much
more
honourably
than
might
have
been
expected
but
she
still
had
to
explain
all
her
life
from
this
point
onward
the
breaking
off
of
her
engagement
with
de
la
marche
her
frequent
quarrels
with
myself
my
sudden
departure
for
america
her
refusal
of
all
offers
of
marriage
all
these
questions
are
abominable
she
said
rising
suddenly
her
physical
strength
having
returned
with
the
exercise
of
her
mental
powers
you
ask
me
to
give
an
account
of
my
inmost
feelings
you
would
sound
the
mysteries
of
my
soul
you
put
my
modesty
on
the
rack
you
would
take
to
yourself
rights
that
belong
only
to
god
i
declare
to
you
that
if
my
own
life
were
now
at
stake
and
not
another
s
you
should
not
extract
a
word
more
from
me
however
to
save
the
life
of
the
meanest
of
men
i
would
overcome
my
repugnance
much
more
therefore
will
i
do
for
him
who
is
now
at
the
bar
know
then
since
you
force
me
to
a
confession
which
is
painful
to
the
pride
and
reserve
of
my
sex
that
everything
which
to
you
seems
inexplicable
in
my
conduct
everything
which
you
attribute
to
bernard
s
persecutions
and
my
own
resentment
to
his
threats
and
my
terror
finds
its
justification
in
one
word
i
love
him
on
uttering
this
word
the
red
blood
in
her
cheeks
and
in
the
ringing
tone
of
the
proudest
and
most
passionate
soul
that
ever
existed
edmee
sat
down
again
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
at
this
moment
i
was
so
transported
that
i
could
not
help
crying
out
let
them
take
me
to
the
scaffold
now
i
am
king
of
all
the
earth
to
the
scaffold
you
said
edmee
rising
again
let
them
rather
take
me
is
it
your
fault
poor
boy
if
for
seven
years
i
have
hidden
from
you
the
secret
of
my
affections
if
i
did
not
wish
you
to
know
it
until
you
were
the
first
of
men
in
wisdom
and
intelligence
as
you
are
already
the
first
in
greatness
of
heart
you
are
paying
dearly
for
my
ambition
since
it
has
been
interpreted
as
scorn
and
hatred
you
have
good
reason
to
hate
me
since
my
pride
has
brought
you
to
the
felon
s
dock
but
i
will
wash
away
your
shame
by
a
signal
reparation
though
they
send
you
to
the
scaffold
you
shall
go
there
with
the
title
of
my
your
generosity
is
carrying
you
too
far
edmee
de
mauprat
said
the
president
it
would
seem
that
in
order
to
save
your
relative
you
are
accusing
yourself
of
coquetry
and
unkindness
for
how
otherwise
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
you
exasperated
this
young
man
s
passion
by
refusing
him
for
seven
years
perhaps
sir
replied
edmee
archly
the
court
is
not
competent
to
judge
this
matter
many
women
think
it
no
great
crime
to
show
a
little
coquetry
with
the
man
they
love
perhaps
we
have
a
right
to
this
when
we
have
sacrificed
all
other
men
to
him
after
all
it
is
a
very
natural
and
very
innocent
ambition
to
make
the
man
of
one
s
choice
feel
that
one
is
a
soul
of
some
price
that
one
is
worth
wooing
and
worth
a
long
effort
true
if
this
coquetry
resulted
in
the
condemnation
of
one
s
lover
to
death
one
would
speedily
correct
one
s
self
of
it
but
naturally
gentlemen
you
would
not
think
of
atoning
for
my
cruelty
by
offering
the
poor
young
man
such
a
consolation
as
after
saying
these
words
in
an
animated
ironical
tone
edmee
burst
into
tears
this
nervous
sensibility
which
brought
to
the
front
all
the
qualities
of
her
soul
and
mind
tenderness
courage
delicacy
pride
modesty
gave
her
face
at
the
same
time
an
expression
so
varied
so
winning
in
all
its
moods
that
the
grave
sombre
assembly
of
judges
let
fall
the
brazen
cuirass
of
impassive
integrity
and
the
leaden
cope
of
hypocritical
virtue
if
edmee
had
not
triumphantly
defended
me
by
her
confession
she
had
at
least
roused
the
greatest
interest
in
my
favour
a
man
who
is
loved
by
a
beautiful
woman
carries
with
him
a
talisman
that
makes
him
invulnerable
all
feel
that
his
life
is
of
greater
value
than
other
lives
edmee
still
had
to
submit
to
many
questions
she
set
in
their
proper
light
the
facts
which
had
been
misrepresented
by
mademoiselle
leblanc
true
she
spared
me
considerably
but
with
admirable
skill
she
managed
to
elude
certain
questions
and
so
escaped
the
necessity
of
either
lying
or
condemning
me
she
generously
took
upon
herself
the
blame
for
all
my
offences
and
pretended
that
if
we
had
had
various
quarrels
it
was
because
she
herself
took
a
secret
pleasure
in
them
because
they
revealed
the
depth
of
my
love
that
she
had
let
me
go
to
america
to
put
my
virtue
to
the
proof
thinking
that
the
campaign
would
not
last
more
than
a
year
as
was
then
supposed
that
afterwards
she
had
considered
me
in
honour
bound
to
submit
to
the
indefinite
prolongation
but
that
she
had
suffered
more
than
myself
from
my
absence
finally
she
quite
remembered
the
letter
which
had
been
found
upon
her
and
taking
it
up
she
gave
the
mutilated
passages
with
astonishing
accuracy
and
at
the
same
time
called
the
clerk
to
follow
as
she
deciphered
the
words
which
were
half
obliterated
this
letter
was
so
far
from
being
a
threatening
letter
she
said
and
the
impression
it
left
on
me
was
so
far
from
filling
me
with
fear
or
aversion
that
it
was
found
on
my
heart
where
i
had
been
carrying
it
for
a
week
though
i
had
not
even
let
bernard
know
that
i
had
received
but
you
have
not
yet
explained
said
the
president
how
it
was
that
seven
years
ago
when
your
cousin
first
came
to
live
in
your
house
you
armed
yourself
with
a
knife
which
you
used
to
put
under
your
pillow
every
night
after
having
it
sharpened
as
if
to
defend
yourself
in
case
of
in
my
family
she
answered
with
a
blush
we
have
a
somewhat
romantic
temperament
and
a
very
proud
spirit
it
is
true
that
i
frequently
thought
of
killing
myself
because
i
felt
an
unconquerable
affection
for
my
cousin
springing
up
in
me
believing
myself
bound
by
indissoluble
ties
to
de
la
marche
i
would
have
died
rather
than
break
my
word
or
marry
any
other
than
bernard
subsequently
de
la
marche
freed
me
from
my
promise
with
much
delicacy
and
loyalty
and
i
no
longer
thought
of
edmee
now
withdrew
followed
by
all
eyes
and
by
a
murmur
of
approbation
no
sooner
had
she
passed
out
of
the
hall
than
she
fainted
again
but
this
attack
was
without
any
grave
consequences
and
left
no
traces
after
a
few
days
i
was
so
bewildered
so
intoxicated
by
what
she
had
just
said
that
henceforth
i
could
scarcely
see
what
was
taking
place
around
me
wholly
wrapped
up
in
thoughts
of
my
love
i
nevertheless
could
not
cast
aside
all
doubts
for
if
edmee
had
been
silent
about
some
of
my
actions
it
was
also
possible
that
she
had
exaggerated
her
affection
for
me
in
the
hope
of
extenuating
my
faults
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
think
that
she
had
loved
me
before
my
departure
for
america
and
above
all
from
the
very
beginning
of
my
stay
at
this
was
the
one
thought
that
filled
my
mind
i
did
not
even
remember
anything
further
about
the
case
or
the
object
of
my
trial
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
sole
question
at
issue
in
this
chill
areopagus
was
this
is
he
loved
or
is
he
not
for
me
victory
or
defeat
life
or
death
hung
on
that
and
that
alone
i
was
roused
from
these
reveries
by
the
voice
of
abbe
aubert
he
was
thin
and
wasted
but
seemed
perfectly
calm
he
had
been
kept
in
solitary
confinement
and
had
suffered
all
the
hardships
of
prison
life
with
the
resignation
of
a
martyr
in
spite
however
of
all
precautions
the
clever
marcasse
who
could
work
his
way
anywhere
like
a
ferret
had
managed
to
convey
to
him
a
letter
from
arthur
to
which
edmee
had
added
a
few
words
authorized
by
this
letter
to
say
everything
he
made
a
statement
similar
to
that
made
by
patience
and
owned
that
edmee
s
first
words
after
the
occurrence
had
made
him
believe
me
guilty
but
that
subsequently
seeing
the
patient
s
mental
condition
and
remembering
my
irreproachable
behaviour
for
more
than
six
years
and
obtaining
a
little
new
light
from
the
preceding
trial
and
the
public
rumours
about
the
possible
existence
of
antony
mauprat
he
had
felt
too
convinced
of
my
innocence
to
be
willing
to
give
evidence
which
might
injure
me
if
he
gave
his
evidence
now
it
was
because
he
thought
that
further
investigations
might
have
enlightened
the
court
and
that
his
words
would
not
have
the
serious
consequences
they
might
have
had
a
month
before
questioned
as
to
edmee
s
feelings
for
me
he
completely
destroyed
all
mademoiselle
leblanc
s
inventions
and
declared
that
not
only
did
edmee
love
me
ardently
but
that
she
had
felt
an
affection
for
me
from
the
very
first
day
we
met
this
he
affirmed
on
oath
though
emphasizing
my
past
misdeeds
somewhat
more
than
edmee
had
done
he
owned
that
at
first
he
had
frequently
feared
that
my
cousin
would
be
foolish
enough
to
marry
me
but
that
he
had
never
had
any
fear
for
her
life
since
he
had
always
seen
her
reduce
me
to
submission
by
a
single
word
or
a
mere
look
even
in
my
most
boorish
days
the
continuation
of
the
trial
was
postponed
to
await
the
results
of
the
warrants
issued
for
the
arrest
of
the
assassin
people
compared
my
trial
to
that
of
calas
and
the
comparison
had
no
sooner
become
a
general
topic
of
conversation
than
my
judges
finding
themselves
exposed
to
a
thousand
shafts
realized
very
vividly
that
hatred
and
prejudice
are
bad
counsellors
and
dangerous
guides
the
sheriff
of
the
province
declared
himself
the
champion
of
my
cause
and
edmee
s
knight
and
he
himself
escorted
her
back
to
her
father
he
set
all
the
police
agog
they
acted
with
vigour
and
arrested
john
mauprat
when
he
found
himself
a
prisoner
and
threatened
he
betrayed
his
brother
and
declared
that
they
might
find
him
any
night
at
hiding
in
a
secret
chamber
which
the
tenant
s
wife
helped
him
to
reach
without
her
husband
s
knowledge
they
took
the
trappist
to
under
a
good
escort
so
that
he
might
show
them
this
secret
chamber
which
in
spite
of
his
genius
for
exploring
walls
and
the
old
hunter
and
marcasse
had
never
managed
to
reach
they
took
me
there
likewise
so
that
i
might
help
to
find
this
room
or
passage
leading
to
it
in
case
the
trappist
should
repent
of
his
present
sincere
intentions
once
again
then
i
revisited
this
abhorred
manor
with
the
ancient
chief
of
the
brigands
transformed
into
a
trappist
he
showed
himself
so
humble
and
cringing
in
my
presence
he
made
so
light
of
his
brother
s
life
and
expressed
such
abject
submission
that
i
was
filled
with
disgust
and
after
a
few
moments
begged
him
not
to
speak
to
me
any
more
keeping
in
touch
with
the
mounted
police
outside
we
began
our
search
for
the
secret
chamber
at
first
john
had
pretended
that
he
knew
of
its
existence
without
knowing
its
exact
location
now
that
of
the
keep
had
been
destroyed
when
he
saw
me
however
he
remembered
that
i
had
surprised
him
in
my
room
and
that
he
had
disappeared
through
the
wall
he
resigned
himself
therefore
to
taking
us
to
it
and
showing
us
the
secret
this
was
very
curious
but
i
will
not
amuse
myself
by
giving
you
an
account
of
it
the
secret
chamber
was
opened
no
one
was
there
yet
the
expedition
had
been
made
with
despatch
and
secrecy
it
did
not
appear
probable
that
john
had
had
time
to
warn
his
brother
the
keep
was
surrounded
by
the
police
and
all
the
doors
were
well
guarded
the
night
was
dark
and
our
invasion
had
filled
all
the
inmates
of
the
farm
with
terror
the
tenant
had
no
idea
what
we
were
looking
for
but
his
wife
s
agitation
and
anxiety
seemed
a
sure
sign
that
antony
was
still
in
the
keep
she
had
not
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
assume
a
reassured
air
after
we
had
explored
the
first
room
and
that
made
marcasse
think
that
there
must
be
a
second
did
the
trappist
know
of
this
and
was
he
pretending
ignorance
he
played
his
part
so
well
that
we
were
all
deceived
we
set
to
work
to
explore
all
the
nooks
and
corners
of
the
ruins
again
there
was
one
large
tower
standing
apart
from
the
other
buildings
it
did
not
seem
as
if
this
could
offer
any
one
a
refuge
the
staircase
had
completely
fallen
in
at
the
time
of
the
fire
and
there
could
not
be
found
a
ladder
long
enough
to
reach
the
top
story
even
the
farmer
s
ladders
tied
together
with
ropes
were
too
short
this
top
story
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
good
preservation
and
to
contain
a
room
lighted
by
two
loopholes
marcasse
after
examining
the
thickness
of
the
wall
affirmed
that
there
might
be
a
staircase
inside
such
as
might
be
found
in
many
an
old
tower
but
where
was
the
exit
perhaps
it
was
connected
with
some
subterranean
passage
would
the
assassin
dare
to
issue
from
his
retreat
as
long
as
we
were
there
if
in
spite
of
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
silence
of
our
proceedings
he
had
got
wind
of
our
presence
would
he
venture
into
the
open
as
long
as
we
continued
on
the
watch
at
all
points
that
is
not
probable
said
marcasse
we
must
devise
some
speedy
means
of
getting
up
there
and
i
see
he
pointed
to
a
beam
at
a
frightful
height
all
blackened
by
the
fire
and
running
from
the
tower
over
a
space
of
some
twenty
feet
to
the
garrets
of
the
nearest
building
at
the
end
of
this
beam
there
was
a
large
gap
in
the
wall
of
the
tower
caused
by
the
of
the
adjoining
parts
in
his
explorations
indeed
marcasse
had
fancied
that
he
could
see
the
steps
of
a
narrow
staircase
through
this
gap
the
wall
moreover
was
quite
thick
enough
to
contain
one
the
had
never
cared
to
risk
his
life
on
this
beam
not
that
he
was
afraid
of
its
narrowness
or
its
height
he
was
accustomed
to
these
perilous
crossings
as
he
called
them
but
the
beam
had
been
partly
consumed
by
the
fire
and
was
so
thin
in
the
middle
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
it
would
bear
the
weight
of
a
man
even
were
he
as
slender
and
diaphanous
as
the
worthy
sergeant
up
to
the
present
nothing
had
happened
here
of
sufficient
importance
for
him
to
risk
his
life
in
the
experiment
now
however
the
case
was
different
marcasse
did
not
hesitate
i
was
not
near
him
when
he
formed
his
plan
i
should
have
dissuaded
him
from
it
at
all
costs
i
was
not
aware
of
it
until
he
had
already
reached
the
middle
of
the
beam
the
spot
where
the
burnt
wood
was
perhaps
nothing
more
than
charcoal
how
shall
i
describe
to
you
what
i
felt
when
i
beheld
my
faithful
friend
in
gravely
walking
toward
his
goal
blaireau
was
trotting
in
front
of
him
as
calmly
as
in
the
old
days
when
it
was
a
question
of
hunting
through
bundles
of
hay
in
search
of
stoats
and
dormice
day
was
breaking
and
the
hildalgo
s
slim
outline
and
his
modest
yet
stately
bearing
could
be
clearly
seen
against
the
gray
sky
i
put
my
hands
to
my
face
i
seemed
to
hear
the
fatal
beam
cracking
i
stifled
a
cry
of
terror
lest
i
should
unnerve
him
at
this
solemn
and
critical
moment
but
i
could
not
suppress
this
cry
or
help
raising
my
head
when
i
heard
two
shots
fired
from
the
tower
marcasse
s
hat
fell
at
the
first
shot
the
second
grazed
his
shoulder
he
stopped
a
moment
not
touched
he
shouted
at
us
and
making
a
rush
he
was
quickly
across
the
aerial
bridge
he
got
into
the
tower
through
the
gap
and
darted
up
the
stairs
crying
follow
me
my
lads
the
beam
will
immediately
five
other
bold
and
active
men
who
had
accompanied
him
got
astride
upon
the
beam
and
with
the
help
of
their
hands
reached
the
other
end
one
by
one
when
the
first
of
them
arrived
in
the
garret
whither
antony
mauprat
had
fled
he
found
him
grappling
with
marcasse
who
quite
carried
away
by
his
triumph
and
forgetting
that
it
was
not
a
question
of
killing
an
enemy
but
of
capturing
him
set
about
lunging
at
him
with
his
long
rapier
as
if
he
had
been
a
weasel
but
the
sham
trappist
was
a
formidable
enemy
he
had
snatched
the
sword
from
the
sergeant
s
hands
hurled
him
to
the
ground
and
would
have
strangled
him
had
not
a
gendarme
thrown
himself
on
him
from
behind
with
his
prodigious
strength
he
held
his
own
against
the
first
three
assailants
but
with
the
help
of
the
other
two
they
succeeded
in
overcoming
him
when
he
saw
that
he
was
caught
he
made
no
further
resistance
and
let
his
hands
be
bound
together
they
brought
him
down
the
stairs
which
were
found
to
lead
to
the
bottom
of
a
dry
well
in
the
middle
of
the
tower
antony
was
in
the
habit
of
leaving
and
entering
by
means
of
a
ladder
which
the
farmer
s
wife
held
for
him
and
immediately
afterwards
withdrew
in
a
transport
of
delight
i
threw
myself
into
my
sergeant
s
arms
a
mere
trifle
he
said
enjoyed
it
i
found
that
my
foot
was
still
sure
and
my
head
cool
ha
ha
old
sergeant
he
added
looking
at
his
leg
old
hidalgo
old
after
this
they
won
t
make
so
many
jokes
about
your
calves
xxix
if
anthony
mauprat
had
been
a
man
of
mettle
he
might
have
done
me
a
bad
turn
by
declaring
that
he
had
been
a
witness
of
my
attempt
to
assassinate
edmee
as
he
had
reasons
for
hiding
himself
before
this
last
crime
he
could
have
explained
why
he
had
kept
out
of
sight
and
why
he
had
been
silent
about
the
occurrences
at
gazeau
tower
i
had
nothing
in
my
favour
except
patience
s
evidence
would
this
have
been
sufficient
to
procure
my
acquittal
the
evidence
of
so
many
others
was
against
me
even
that
given
by
my
friends
and
by
edmee
who
could
not
deny
my
violent
temper
and
the
possibility
of
such
a
crime
but
antony
in
words
the
most
insolent
of
all
the
hamstringers
was
the
most
cowardly
in
deeds
he
no
sooner
found
himself
in
the
hands
of
justice
than
he
confessed
everything
even
before
knowing
that
his
brother
had
thrown
him
over
at
his
trial
there
were
some
scandalous
scenes
in
which
the
two
brothers
accused
each
other
in
a
loathsome
way
the
trappist
whose
rage
was
kept
in
check
by
his
hypocrisy
coldly
abandoned
the
ruffian
to
his
fate
and
denied
that
he
had
ever
advised
him
to
commit
the
crime
the
other
driven
to
desperation
accused
him
of
the
most
horrible
deeds
including
the
poisoning
of
my
mother
and
edmee
s
mother
who
had
both
died
of
violent
inflammation
of
the
intestines
within
a
short
time
of
each
other
john
mauprat
he
declared
used
to
be
very
skilful
in
the
art
of
preparing
poisons
and
would
introduce
himself
into
houses
under
various
disguises
to
mix
them
with
the
food
he
affirmed
that
on
the
day
that
edmee
had
been
brought
to
john
had
called
together
all
his
brothers
to
discuss
plans
for
making
away
with
this
heiress
to
a
considerable
fortune
a
fortune
which
he
had
striven
to
obtain
by
crime
since
he
had
tried
to
destroy
the
effects
of
the
chevalier
hubert
s
marriage
my
mother
s
life
too
had
been
the
price
paid
for
the
latter
s
wish
to
adopt
his
brother
s
child
all
the
mauprats
had
been
in
favour
of
making
away
with
edmee
and
myself
simultaneously
and
john
was
actually
preparing
the
poison
when
the
police
happened
to
turn
aside
their
hideous
designs
by
attacking
the
castle
john
denied
the
charges
with
pretended
horror
saying
humbly
that
he
had
committed
quite
enough
mortal
sins
of
debauchery
and
irreligion
without
having
these
added
to
his
list
as
it
was
difficult
to
take
antony
s
word
for
them
without
further
investigation
as
this
investigation
was
almost
impossible
and
as
the
clergy
were
too
powerful
and
too
much
interested
in
preventing
a
scandal
to
allow
it
john
mauprat
was
acquitted
on
the
charge
of
complicity
and
merely
sent
back
to
the
trappist
monastery
the
archbishop
forbade
him
ever
to
set
foot
in
the
diocese
again
and
moreover
sent
a
request
to
his
superiors
that
they
would
never
allow
him
to
leave
the
convent
he
died
there
a
few
years
later
in
all
the
terrors
of
a
fanatic
penitence
very
much
akin
to
insanity
it
is
probable
that
as
a
result
of
feigning
remorse
in
order
to
find
favour
among
his
fellows
he
had
at
last
after
the
failure
of
his
plans
and
under
the
terrible
asceticism
of
his
order
actually
experienced
the
horrors
and
agonies
of
a
bad
conscience
and
tardy
repentance
the
fear
of
hell
is
the
only
creed
of
vile
souls
no
sooner
was
i
acquitted
and
set
at
liberty
with
my
character
completely
cleared
than
i
hastened
to
edmee
i
arrived
in
time
to
witness
my
s
last
moments
towards
the
end
though
his
mind
remained
a
blank
as
to
past
events
the
memory
of
his
heart
returned
he
recognised
me
clasped
me
to
his
breast
blessed
me
at
the
same
time
as
edmee
and
put
my
hand
into
his
daughter
s
after
we
had
paid
the
last
tribute
of
affection
to
our
excellent
and
noble
kinsman
whom
we
were
as
grieved
to
lose
as
if
we
had
not
long
foreseen
and
expected
his
death
we
left
the
province
for
some
time
so
as
not
to
witness
the
execution
of
antony
who
was
condemned
to
be
broken
on
the
wheel
the
two
false
witnesses
who
had
accused
me
were
flogged
branded
and
expelled
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
mademoiselle
leblanc
who
could
not
exactly
be
accused
of
giving
false
evidence
since
hers
had
consisted
of
mere
inferences
from
facts
avoided
the
public
displeasure
by
going
to
another
province
here
she
lived
in
sufficient
luxury
to
make
us
suspect
that
she
had
been
paid
considerable
sums
to
bring
about
my
ruin
edmee
and
i
would
not
consent
to
be
separated
even
temporarily
from
our
good
friends
my
sole
defenders
marcasse
patience
arthur
and
the
abbe
aubert
we
all
travelled
in
the
same
carriage
the
first
two
being
accustomed
to
the
open
air
were
only
too
glad
to
sit
outside
but
we
treated
them
on
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
from
that
day
forth
they
never
sat
at
any
table
but
our
own
some
persons
had
the
bad
taste
to
express
astonishment
at
this
we
let
them
talk
there
are
circumstances
that
obliterate
all
distinctions
real
or
imaginary
of
rank
and
education
we
paid
a
visit
to
switzerland
arthur
considered
this
was
essential
to
the
complete
restoration
of
edmee
s
health
the
delicate
thoughtful
attentions
of
this
devoted
friend
and
the
loving
efforts
we
made
to
minister
to
her
happiness
combined
into
the
beautiful
spectacle
of
the
mountains
to
drive
away
her
melancholy
and
efface
the
recollection
of
the
troublous
times
through
which
we
had
just
passed
on
patience
s
poetic
nature
switzerland
had
quite
a
magic
effect
he
would
frequently
fall
into
such
a
state
of
ecstasy
that
we
were
entranced
and
terrified
at
the
same
time
he
felt
strongly
tempted
to
build
himself
a
chalet
in
the
heart
of
some
valley
and
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
there
in
contemplation
of
nature
but
his
affection
for
us
made
him
abandon
this
project
as
for
marcasse
he
declared
subsequently
that
despite
all
the
pleasure
he
had
derived
from
our
society
he
looked
upon
this
visit
as
the
most
unlucky
event
of
his
life
at
the
inn
at
martigny
on
our
return
journey
blaireau
whose
digestion
had
been
impaired
by
age
fell
a
victim
to
the
excess
of
hospitality
shown
him
in
the
kitchen
the
sergeant
said
not
a
word
but
gazed
on
him
awhile
with
heavy
eye
and
then
went
and
buried
him
under
the
most
beautiful
in
the
garden
nor
did
he
speak
of
his
loss
until
more
than
a
year
later
during
our
journey
edmee
was
for
me
a
veritable
angel
of
kindness
and
tender
thought
abandoning
herself
henceforth
to
all
the
inspirations
of
her
heart
and
no
longer
feeling
any
distrust
of
me
or
perhaps
thinking
that
i
deserved
some
compensation
for
all
my
sufferings
she
repeatedly
confirmed
the
celestial
assurances
of
love
which
she
had
given
in
public
when
she
lifted
up
her
voice
to
proclaim
my
innocence
a
few
reservations
that
had
struck
me
in
her
evidence
and
a
recollection
of
the
damning
words
that
had
fallen
from
her
lips
when
patience
found
her
shot
continued
i
must
confess
to
cause
me
pain
for
some
time
longer
i
thought
rightly
perhaps
that
edmee
had
made
a
great
effort
to
believe
in
my
innocence
before
patience
had
given
his
evidence
but
on
this
point
she
always
spoke
most
unwillingly
and
with
a
certain
amount
of
reserve
however
one
day
she
quite
healed
my
wound
by
saying
with
her
charming
abruptness
and
if
i
loved
you
enough
to
absolve
you
in
my
own
heart
and
defend
you
in
public
at
the
cost
of
a
lie
what
would
you
say
to
that
a
point
on
which
i
felt
no
less
concern
was
to
know
how
far
i
might
believe
in
the
love
which
she
declared
she
had
had
for
me
from
the
very
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
here
she
betrayed
a
little
confusion
as
if
in
her
invincible
pride
she
regretted
having
revealed
a
secret
she
had
so
jealously
guarded
it
was
the
abbe
who
undertook
to
confess
for
her
he
assured
me
that
at
that
time
he
had
frequently
scolded
edmee
for
her
affection
for
the
young
as
an
objection
to
this
i
told
him
of
the
conversation
between
edmee
and
himself
which
i
had
overheard
one
evening
in
the
park
this
i
repeated
with
that
great
accuracy
of
memory
i
possess
however
he
replied
that
very
evening
if
you
had
followed
us
a
little
further
under
the
trees
you
might
have
overheard
a
dispute
that
would
have
completely
reassured
you
and
have
explained
how
from
being
repugnant
i
may
almost
say
odious
to
me
as
you
then
were
you
became
at
first
endurable
and
gradually
very
you
must
tell
me
i
exclaimed
who
worked
the
one
word
will
explain
it
he
answered
edmee
loved
you
when
she
had
confessed
this
to
me
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
remained
for
a
moment
as
if
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
vexation
then
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
and
exclaimed
well
since
you
wish
to
know
the
absolute
truth
i
love
him
yes
i
love
him
i
am
smitten
with
him
as
you
say
it
is
not
my
fault
why
should
i
blush
at
it
i
can
not
help
it
it
is
the
work
of
fate
i
have
never
loved
de
la
marche
i
merely
feel
a
friendship
for
him
for
bernard
i
have
a
very
different
feeling
a
feeling
so
strong
so
varied
so
full
of
unrest
of
hatred
of
fear
of
pity
of
anger
of
tenderness
that
i
understand
nothing
about
it
and
no
longer
try
to
understand
oh
woman
woman
i
exclaimed
clasping
my
hands
in
bewilderment
thou
art
a
mystery
an
abyss
and
he
who
thinks
to
know
thee
is
totally
mad
as
many
times
as
you
like
abbe
she
answered
with
a
firmness
in
which
there
were
signs
of
annoyance
and
confusion
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
on
this
point
i
have
lectured
myself
more
than
you
have
lectured
all
your
flocks
in
your
whole
life
i
know
that
bernard
is
a
bear
a
badger
as
mademoiselle
leblanc
calls
him
a
savage
a
boor
and
anything
else
you
like
there
is
nothing
more
shaggy
more
prickly
more
cunning
more
malicious
than
bernard
he
is
an
animal
who
scarcely
knows
how
to
sign
his
name
he
is
a
coarse
brute
who
thinks
he
can
break
me
in
like
one
of
the
jades
of
varenne
but
he
makes
a
great
mistake
i
will
die
rather
than
ever
be
his
unless
he
becomes
civilized
enough
to
marry
me
but
one
might
as
well
expect
a
miracle
i
try
to
improve
him
without
daring
to
hope
however
whether
he
forces
me
to
kill
myself
or
to
turn
nun
whether
he
remains
as
he
is
or
becomes
worse
it
will
be
none
the
less
true
that
i
love
him
my
dear
abbe
you
know
that
it
must
be
costing
me
something
to
make
this
confession
and
when
my
affection
for
you
brings
me
as
a
penitent
to
your
feet
and
to
your
bosom
you
should
not
humiliate
me
by
your
expressions
of
surprise
and
your
exorcisms
consider
the
matter
now
examine
discuss
decide
consider
the
matter
now
examine
discuss
decide
the
evil
is
i
love
him
the
symptoms
are
i
think
of
none
but
him
i
see
none
but
him
and
i
could
eat
no
dinner
this
evening
because
he
had
not
come
back
i
find
him
handsomer
than
any
man
in
the
world
when
he
says
that
he
loves
me
i
can
see
i
can
feel
that
it
is
true
i
feel
displeased
and
at
the
same
time
delighted
de
la
marche
seems
insipid
and
prim
since
i
have
known
bernard
bernard
alone
seems
as
proud
as
passionate
as
bold
as
myself
and
as
weak
as
myself
for
he
cries
like
a
child
when
i
vex
him
and
here
i
am
crying
too
as
i
think
of
dear
abbe
i
said
throwing
myself
on
his
neck
let
me
embrace
you
till
i
have
crushed
your
life
out
for
remembering
all
the
abbe
is
drawing
the
long
bow
said
edmee
archly
what
i
exclaimed
pressing
her
hands
as
if
i
would
break
them
you
have
made
me
suffer
for
seven
years
and
now
you
repent
a
few
words
that
console
me
in
any
case
do
not
regret
the
past
she
said
ah
with
you
such
as
you
were
in
those
days
we
should
have
been
ruined
if
i
had
not
been
able
to
think
and
decide
for
both
of
us
good
god
what
would
have
become
of
us
by
now
you
would
have
had
far
more
to
suffer
from
my
sternness
and
pride
for
you
would
have
offended
me
from
the
very
first
day
of
our
union
and
i
should
have
had
to
punish
you
by
running
away
or
killing
myself
or
killing
you
for
we
are
given
to
killing
in
our
family
it
is
a
natural
habit
one
thing
is
certain
and
that
is
that
you
would
have
been
a
detestable
husband
you
would
have
made
me
blush
for
your
ignorance
you
would
have
wanted
to
rule
me
and
we
should
have
fallen
foul
of
each
other
that
would
have
driven
my
father
to
despair
and
as
you
know
my
father
had
to
be
considered
before
everything
i
might
perhaps
have
risked
my
own
fate
lightly
enough
if
i
had
been
alone
in
the
world
for
i
have
a
strain
of
rashness
in
my
nature
but
it
was
essential
that
my
father
should
remain
happy
and
tranquil
and
respected
he
had
brought
me
up
in
happiness
and
independence
and
i
should
never
have
forgiven
myself
if
i
had
deprived
his
old
age
of
the
blessings
he
had
lavished
on
my
whole
life
do
not
think
that
i
am
full
of
virtues
and
noble
qualities
as
the
abbe
pretends
i
love
that
is
all
but
i
love
strongly
exclusively
steadfastly
i
sacrificed
you
to
my
father
my
poor
bernard
and
heaven
who
would
have
cursed
us
if
i
had
sacrificed
my
father
rewards
us
by
giving
us
to
each
other
tried
and
not
found
wanting
as
you
grew
greater
in
my
eyes
i
felt
that
i
could
wait
because
i
knew
i
had
to
love
you
long
and
i
was
not
afraid
of
seeing
my
passion
vanish
before
it
was
satisfied
as
do
the
passions
of
feeble
souls
we
were
two
exceptional
characters
our
loves
had
to
be
heroic
the
beaten
track
would
have
led
both
of
us
to
xxx
we
returned
to
at
the
expiration
of
edmee
s
period
of
mourning
this
was
the
time
that
had
been
fixed
for
our
marriage
when
we
had
quitted
the
province
where
we
had
both
experienced
so
many
bitter
mortifications
and
such
grievous
trials
we
had
imagined
that
we
should
never
feel
any
inclination
to
return
yet
so
powerful
are
the
recollections
of
childhood
and
the
ties
of
family
life
that
even
in
the
heart
of
an
enchanted
land
which
could
not
arouse
painful
memories
we
had
quickly
begun
to
regret
our
gloomy
wild
varenne
and
sighed
for
the
old
oaks
in
the
park
we
returned
then
with
a
sense
of
profound
yet
solemn
joy
edmee
s
first
care
was
to
gather
the
beautiful
flowers
in
the
garden
and
to
kneel
by
her
father
s
grave
and
arrange
them
on
it
we
kissed
the
hallowed
ground
and
there
made
a
vow
to
strive
unceasingly
to
leave
a
name
as
worthy
of
respect
and
veneration
as
his
he
had
frequently
carried
this
ambition
to
the
verge
of
weakness
but
it
was
a
noble
weakness
a
sacred
vanity
our
marriage
was
celebrated
in
the
village
chapel
and
the
festivities
were
confined
to
the
family
none
but
arthur
the
abbe
marcasse
and
patience
sat
down
to
our
modest
banquet
what
need
had
we
of
the
outside
world
to
behold
our
happiness
they
might
have
believed
perhaps
that
they
were
doing
us
an
honour
by
covering
the
blots
on
our
escutcheon
with
their
august
presence
we
were
enough
to
be
happy
and
merry
among
ourselves
our
hearts
were
filled
with
as
much
affection
as
they
could
hold
we
were
too
proud
to
ask
more
from
any
one
too
pleased
with
one
another
to
yearn
for
greater
pleasure
patience
returned
to
his
sober
retired
life
resumed
the
duties
of
great
judge
and
treasurer
on
certain
days
of
the
week
marcasse
remained
with
me
until
his
death
which
happened
towards
the
end
of
the
french
revolution
i
trust
i
did
my
best
to
repay
his
fidelity
by
an
unreserved
friendship
and
an
intimacy
that
nothing
could
disturb
arthur
who
had
sacrificed
a
year
of
his
life
to
us
could
not
bring
himself
to
abjure
the
love
of
his
country
and
his
desire
to
contribute
to
its
progress
by
offering
it
the
fruits
of
his
learning
and
the
results
of
his
investigations
he
returned
to
philadelphia
where
i
paid
him
a
visit
after
i
was
left
a
widower
i
will
not
describe
my
years
of
happiness
with
my
noble
wife
such
years
beggar
description
one
could
not
resign
one
s
self
to
living
after
losing
them
if
one
did
not
make
strenuous
efforts
to
avoid
recalling
them
too
often
she
gave
me
six
children
four
of
these
are
still
alive
and
all
honourably
settled
in
life
i
have
lived
for
them
in
obedience
to
edmee
s
dying
command
you
must
forgive
me
for
not
speaking
further
of
this
loss
which
i
suffered
only
ten
years
ago
i
feel
it
now
as
keenly
as
on
the
first
day
and
i
do
not
seek
to
find
consolation
for
it
but
to
make
myself
worthy
of
rejoining
the
holy
comrade
of
my
life
in
a
better
world
after
i
have
completed
my
period
of
probation
in
this
she
was
the
only
woman
i
ever
loved
never
did
any
other
win
a
glance
from
me
or
know
the
pressure
of
my
hand
such
is
my
nature
what
i
love
i
love
eternally
in
the
past
in
the
present
in
the
future
the
storms
of
the
revolution
did
not
destroy
our
existence
nor
did
the
passions
it
aroused
disturb
the
harmony
of
our
private
life
we
gladly
gave
up
a
large
part
of
our
property
to
the
republic
looking
upon
it
indeed
as
a
just
sacrifice
the
abbe
terrified
by
the
bloodshed
occasionally
abjured
this
political
faith
when
the
necessities
of
the
hour
were
too
much
for
the
strength
of
his
soul
he
was
the
girondin
of
the
family
with
no
less
sensibility
edmee
had
greater
courage
a
woman
and
compassionate
she
sympathized
profoundly
with
the
sufferings
of
all
classes
she
bewailed
the
misfortune
of
her
age
but
she
never
failed
to
appreciate
the
greatness
of
its
holy
fanaticism
she
remained
faithful
to
her
ideas
of
absolute
equality
at
a
time
when
the
acts
of
the
mountain
were
irritating
the
abbe
and
driving
him
to
despair
she
generously
sacrificed
her
own
patriotic
enthusiasm
and
her
delicacy
would
never
let
her
mention
in
his
presence
certain
names
that
made
him
shudder
names
for
which
she
herself
had
a
sort
of
passionate
veneration
the
like
of
which
i
have
never
seen
in
any
woman
as
for
myself
i
can
truthfully
say
that
it
was
she
who
educated
me
during
the
whole
course
of
my
life
i
had
the
profoundest
respect
for
her
judgment
and
rectitude
when
in
my
enthusiasm
i
was
filled
with
a
longing
to
play
a
part
as
a
leader
of
the
people
she
held
me
back
by
showing
how
my
name
would
destroy
any
influence
i
might
have
since
they
would
distrust
me
and
imagine
my
aim
was
to
use
them
as
an
instrument
for
recovering
my
rank
when
the
enemy
was
at
the
gates
of
france
she
sent
me
to
serve
as
a
volunteer
when
the
republic
was
overthrown
and
a
military
career
came
to
be
merely
a
means
of
gratifying
ambition
she
recalled
me
and
said
you
must
never
leave
me
patience
played
a
great
part
in
the
revolution
he
was
unanimously
chosen
as
judge
of
his
district
his
integrity
his
impartiality
between
castle
and
cottage
his
firmness
and
wisdom
will
never
be
forgotten
in
varenne
during
the
war
i
was
instrumental
in
saving
de
la
marche
s
life
and
helping
him
to
escape
to
a
foreign
country
such
i
believe
said
old
mauprat
are
all
the
events
of
my
life
in
which
edmee
played
a
part
the
rest
of
it
is
not
worth
the
telling
if
there
is
anything
helpful
in
my
story
try
to
profit
by
it
young
fellows
hope
to
be
blessed
with
a
frank
counsellor
a
severe
friend
and
love
not
the
man
who
flatters
but
the
man
who
reproves
do
not
believe
too
much
in
phrenology
for
i
have
the
murderer
s
bump
largely
developed
and
as
edmee
used
to
say
with
grim
humour
killing
comes
natural
to
our
family
do
not
believe
in
fate
or
at
least
never
advise
any
one
to
tamely
submit
to
it
such
is
the
moral
of
my
story
after
this
old
bernard
gave
us
a
good
supper
and
continued
conversing
with
us
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
without
showing
any
signs
of
discomposure
or
fatigue
as
we
begged
him
to
develop
what
he
called
the
moral
of
his
story
a
little
further
he
proceeded
to
a
few
general
considerations
which
impressed
me
with
their
soundness
and
good
sense
i
spoke
of
phrenology
he
said
not
with
the
object
of
criticising
a
system
which
has
its
good
side
in
so
far
as
it
tends
to
complete
the
series
of
physiological
observations
that
aim
at
increasing
our
knowledge
of
man
i
used
the
word
phrenology
because
the
only
fatality
that
we
believe
in
nowadays
is
that
created
by
our
own
instincts
i
do
not
believe
that
phrenology
is
more
fatalistic
than
any
other
system
of
this
kind
and
lavater
who
was
also
accused
of
fatalism
in
his
time
was
the
most
christian
man
the
gospel
has
ever
formed
do
not
believe
in
any
absolute
and
inevitable
fate
and
yet
acknowledge
in
a
measure
that
we
are
moulded
by
instincts
our
faculties
the
impressions
of
our
infancy
the
surroundings
of
our
earliest
childhood
in
short
by
all
that
outside
world
which
has
presided
over
the
development
of
our
soul
admit
that
we
are
not
always
absolutely
free
to
choose
between
good
and
evil
if
you
would
be
indulgent
towards
the
guilty
that
is
to
say
just
even
as
heaven
is
just
for
there
is
infinite
mercy
in
god
s
judgments
otherwise
his
justice
would
be
imperfect
what
i
am
saying
now
is
not
very
orthodox
but
take
my
word
for
it
it
is
christian
because
it
is
true
man
is
not
born
wicked
neither
is
he
born
good
as
is
maintained
by
jean
jacques
rousseau
my
beloved
edmee
s
old
master
man
is
born
with
more
or
less
of
passions
with
more
or
less
power
to
satisfy
them
with
more
or
less
capacity
for
turning
them
to
a
good
or
bad
account
in
society
but
education
can
and
must
find
a
remedy
for
everything
that
is
the
great
problem
to
be
solved
to
discover
the
education
best
suited
to
each
individual
if
it
seems
necessary
that
education
should
be
general
and
in
common
does
it
follow
that
it
ought
to
be
the
same
for
all
i
quite
believe
that
if
i
had
been
sent
to
school
when
i
was
ten
i
should
have
become
a
civilized
being
earlier
but
would
any
one
have
thought
of
correcting
my
violent
passions
and
of
teaching
me
how
to
conquer
them
as
edmee
did
i
doubt
it
every
man
needs
to
be
loved
before
he
can
be
worth
anything
but
each
in
a
different
way
one
with
indulgence
another
with
unflinching
severity
meanwhile
until
some
one
solves
the
problem
of
making
education
common
to
all
and
yet
appropriate
to
each
try
to
improve
one
another
do
you
ask
me
how
my
answer
will
be
brief
by
loving
one
another
truly
it
is
in
this
way
for
the
manners
of
a
people
mould
their
laws
that
you
will
succeed
in
suppressing
the
most
odious
and
impious
of
all
laws
the
capital
punishment
which
is
nothing
else
than
the
consecration
of
the
principle
of
fatality
seeing
that
it
supposes
the
culprit
incorrigible
and
heaven
implacable
