first
the
social
spirit
peculiar
to
the
french
nation
had
already
introduced
into
the
inns
of
that
country
the
gay
and
cheerful
character
of
welcome
upon
which
erasmus
at
a
later
period
dwells
with
strong
emphasis
as
a
contrast
to
the
saturnine
and
sullen
reception
which
strangers
were
apt
to
meet
with
at
a
german
caravansera
philipson
was
therefore
in
expectation
of
being
received
by
the
busy
civil
and
talkative
host
by
the
hostess
and
her
daughter
all
softness
coquetry
and
glee
the
smiling
and
supple
waiter
the
officious
and
dimpled
chambermaid
the
better
inns
in
france
boast
also
separate
rooms
where
strangers
could
change
or
put
in
order
their
dress
where
they
might
sleep
without
company
in
their
bedroom
and
where
they
could
deposit
their
baggage
in
privacy
and
safety
but
all
these
luxuries
were
as
yet
unknown
in
germany
and
in
alsace
where
the
scene
now
lies
as
well
as
in
the
other
dependencies
of
the
empire
they
regarded
as
effeminacy
everything
beyond
such
provisions
as
were
absolutely
necessary
for
the
supply
of
the
wants
of
travellers
and
even
these
were
coarse
and
indifferent
and
excepting
in
the
article
of
wine
sparingly
ministered
the
englishman
finding
that
no
one
appeared
at
the
gate
began
to
make
his
presence
known
by
calling
aloud
and
finally
by
alighting
and
smiting
with
all
his
might
on
the
doors
of
the
hostelry
for
a
long
time
without
attracting
the
least
attention
at
length
the
head
of
a
grizzled
servitor
was
thrust
out
at
a
small
window
who
in
a
voice
which
sounded
like
that
of
one
displeased
at
the
interruption
rather
than
hopeful
of
advantage
from
the
arrival
of
a
guest
demanded
what
he
wanted
is
this
an
inn
replied
philipson
yes
bluntly
replied
the
domestic
and
was
about
to
withdraw
from
the
window
when
the
traveller
added
and
if
it
be
can
i
have
lodgings
you
may
come
in
was
the
short
and
dry
answer
send
some
one
to
take
the
horses
replied
philipson
no
one
is
at
leisure
replied
this
most
repulsive
of
waiters
you
must
litter
down
your
horses
yourself
in
the
way
that
likes
you
best
where
is
the
stable
said
the
merchant
whose
prudence
and
temper
were
scarce
proof
against
this
dutch
phlegm
the
fellow
who
seemed
as
sparing
of
his
words
as
if
like
the
princess
in
the
fairy
tale
he
had
dropped
ducats
with
each
of
them
only
pointed
to
a
door
in
an
outer
building
more
resembling
that
of
a
cellar
than
of
a
stable
and
as
if
weary
of
the
conference
drew
in
his
head
and
shut
the
window
sharply
against
the
guest
as
he
would
against
an
importunate
beggar
cursing
the
spirit
of
independence
which
left
a
traveller
to
his
own
resources
and
exertions
philipson
making
a
virtue
of
necessity
led
the
two
nags
towards
the
door
pointed
out
as
that
of
the
stable
and
was
rejoiced
at
heart
to
see
light
glimmering
through
its
chinks
he
entered
with
his
charge
into
a
place
very
like
the
dungeon
vault
of
an
ancient
castle
rudely
fitted
up
with
some
racks
and
mangers
it
was
of
considerable
extent
in
point
of
length
and
at
the
lower
end
two
or
three
persons
were
engaged
in
tying
up
their
horses
dressing
them
and
dispensing
them
their
provender
this
last
article
was
delivered
by
the
ostler
a
very
old
lame
man
who
neither
put
his
hand
to
wisp
or
but
sat
weighing
forth
hay
by
the
pound
and
counting
out
corn
as
it
seemed
by
the
grain
so
anxiously
did
he
bend
over
his
task
by
the
aid
of
a
blinking
light
enclosed
within
a
horn
lantern
he
did
not
even
turn
his
head
at
the
noise
which
the
englishman
made
on
entering
the
place
with
two
additional
horses
far
less
did
he
seem
disposed
to
give
himself
the
least
trouble
or
the
stranger
the
smallest
assistance
in
respect
of
cleanliness
the
stable
of
augeas
bore
no
small
resemblance
to
that
of
this
alsatian
and
it
would
have
been
an
exploit
worthy
of
hercules
to
have
restored
it
to
such
a
state
of
cleanliness
as
would
have
made
it
barely
decent
in
the
eyes
and
tolerable
to
the
nostrils
of
the
punctilious
englishman
but
this
was
a
matter
which
disgusted
philipson
himself
much
more
than
those
of
his
party
which
were
principally
concerned
they
the
two
horses
seeming
perfectly
to
understand
that
the
rule
of
the
place
was
first
come
first
served
hastened
to
occupy
the
empty
stalls
which
happened
to
be
nearest
to
them
in
this
one
of
them
at
least
was
disappointed
being
received
by
a
groom
with
a
blow
across
the
face
with
a
switch
take
that
said
the
fellow
for
forcing
thyself
into
the
place
taken
up
for
the
horses
of
the
baron
of
randelsheim
never
in
the
course
of
his
life
had
the
english
merchant
more
pain
to
retain
possession
of
his
temper
than
at
that
moment
reflecting
however
on
the
discredit
of
quarrelling
with
such
a
man
in
such
a
cause
he
contented
himself
with
placing
the
animal
thus
repulsed
from
the
stall
he
had
chosen
into
one
next
to
that
of
his
companion
to
which
no
one
seemed
to
lay
claim
the
merchant
then
proceeded
notwithstanding
the
fatigue
of
the
day
to
pay
all
that
attention
to
the
mute
companions
of
his
journey
which
they
deserve
from
every
traveller
who
has
any
share
of
prudence
to
say
nothing
of
humanity
the
unusual
degree
of
trouble
which
philipson
took
to
arrange
his
horses
although
his
dress
and
much
more
his
demeanour
seemed
to
place
him
above
this
species
of
servile
labour
appeared
to
make
an
impression
even
upon
the
iron
insensibility
of
the
old
ostler
himself
he
showed
some
alacrity
in
furnishing
the
traveller
who
knew
the
business
of
a
groom
so
well
with
corn
straw
and
hay
though
in
small
quantity
and
at
exorbitant
rates
which
were
instantly
to
be
paid
nay
he
even
went
as
far
as
the
door
of
the
stable
that
he
might
point
across
the
court
to
the
well
from
which
philipson
was
obliged
to
fetch
water
with
his
own
hands
the
duties
of
the
stable
being
finished
the
merchant
concluded
that
he
had
gained
such
an
interest
with
the
grim
master
of
the
horse
as
to
learn
of
him
whether
he
might
leave
his
bales
safely
in
the
stable
you
may
leave
them
if
you
will
said
the
ostler
but
touching
their
safety
you
will
do
much
more
wisely
if
you
take
them
with
you
and
give
no
temptation
to
any
one
by
suffering
them
to
pass
from
under
your
own
eyes
so
saying
the
man
of
oats
closed
his
oracular
jaws
nor
could
he
be
prevailed
upon
to
unlock
them
again
by
any
inquiry
which
his
customer
could
devise
in
the
course
of
this
cold
and
comfortless
reception
philipson
recollected
the
necessity
of
supporting
the
character
of
a
prudent
and
wary
trader
which
he
had
forgotten
once
before
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
imitating
what
he
saw
the
others
do
who
had
been
like
himself
engaged
in
taking
charge
of
their
horses
he
took
up
his
baggage
and
removed
himself
and
his
property
to
the
inn
here
he
was
suffered
to
enter
rather
than
admitted
into
the
general
or
public
or
room
of
entertainment
which
like
the
ark
of
the
patriarch
received
all
ranks
without
distinction
whether
clean
or
unclean
the
or
stove
of
a
german
inn
derived
its
name
from
the
great
hypocaust
which
is
always
strongly
heated
to
secure
the
warmth
of
the
apartment
in
which
it
is
placed
there
travellers
of
every
age
and
description
assembled
there
their
upper
garments
were
indiscriminately
hung
up
around
the
stove
to
dry
or
to
air
and
the
guests
themselves
were
seen
employed
in
various
acts
of
ablution
or
personal
arrangement
which
are
generally
in
modern
times
referred
to
the
privacy
of
the
the
more
refined
feelings
of
the
englishman
were
disgusted
with
this
scene
and
he
was
reluctant
to
mingle
in
it
for
this
reason
he
inquired
for
the
private
retreat
of
the
landlord
himself
trusting
that
by
some
of
the
arguments
powerful
among
his
tribe
he
might
obtain
separate
quarters
from
the
crowd
and
a
morsel
of
food
to
be
eaten
in
private
a
ganymede
to
whom
he
put
the
question
where
the
landlord
was
indicated
a
recess
behind
the
huge
stove
where
veiling
his
glory
in
a
very
dark
and
extremely
hot
corner
it
pleased
the
great
man
to
obscure
himself
from
vulgar
gaze
there
was
something
remarkable
about
this
person
short
stout
bandylegged
and
consequential
he
was
in
these
respects
like
many
brethren
of
the
profession
in
all
countries
but
the
countenance
of
the
man
and
still
more
his
manners
differed
more
from
the
merry
host
of
france
or
england
than
even
the
experienced
philipson
was
prepared
to
expect
he
knew
german
customs
too
well
to
expect
the
suppliant
and
serviceable
qualities
of
the
master
of
a
french
inn
or
even
the
more
blunt
and
frank
manners
of
an
english
landlord
but
such
german
innkeepers
as
he
had
yet
seen
though
indeed
arbitrary
and
peremptory
in
their
country
fashions
yet
being
humoured
in
these
they
like
tyrants
in
their
hours
of
relaxation
dealt
kindly
with
the
guests
over
whom
their
sway
extended
and
mitigated
by
jest
and
jollity
the
harshness
of
their
absolute
power
but
this
man
brow
was
like
a
tragic
volume
in
which
you
were
as
unlikely
to
find
anything
of
jest
or
amusement
as
in
a
hermit
breviary
his
answers
were
short
sudden
and
repulsive
and
the
air
and
manner
with
which
they
were
delivered
was
as
surly
as
their
tenor
which
will
appear
from
the
following
dialogue
betwixt
him
and
his
guest
good
host
said
philipson
in
the
mildest
tone
he
could
assume
i
am
fatigued
and
far
from
well
may
i
request
to
have
a
separate
apartment
a
cup
of
wine
and
a
morsel
of
food
in
my
private
chamber
you
may
answered
the
landlord
but
with
a
look
strangely
at
variance
with
the
apparent
acquiescence
which
his
words
naturally
implied
let
me
have
such
accommodation
then
with
your
earliest
convenience
soft
replied
the
innkeeper
i
have
said
that
you
may
request
these
things
but
not
that
i
would
grant
them
if
you
would
insist
on
being
served
differently
from
others
it
must
be
at
another
inn
than
mine
well
then
said
the
traveller
i
will
shift
without
supper
for
a
night
nay
more
i
will
be
content
to
pay
for
a
supper
which
i
do
not
eat
if
you
will
cause
me
to
be
accommodated
with
a
private
apartment
seignor
traveller
said
the
innkeeper
every
one
here
must
be
accommodated
as
well
as
you
since
all
pay
alike
whoso
comes
to
this
house
of
entertainment
must
eat
as
others
eat
drink
as
others
drink
sit
at
table
with
the
rest
of
my
guests
and
go
to
bed
when
the
company
have
done
drinking
all
this
said
philipson
humbling
himself
where
anger
would
have
been
ridiculous
is
highly
reasonable
and
i
do
not
oppose
myself
to
your
laws
or
customs
but
added
he
taking
his
purse
from
his
girdle
sickness
craves
some
privilege
and
when
the
patient
is
willing
to
pay
for
it
methinks
the
rigour
of
your
laws
may
admit
of
some
mitigation
i
keep
an
inn
seignor
and
not
a
hospital
if
you
remain
here
you
shall
be
served
with
the
same
attention
as
others
if
you
are
not
willing
to
do
as
others
do
leave
my
house
and
seek
another
inn
on
receiving
this
decisive
rebuff
philipson
gave
up
the
contest
and
retired
from
the
of
his
ungracious
host
to
await
the
arrival
of
supper
penned
up
like
a
bullock
in
a
pound
amongst
the
crowded
inhabitants
of
the
some
of
these
exhausted
by
fatigue
snored
away
the
interval
between
their
own
arrival
and
that
of
the
expected
repast
others
conversed
together
on
the
news
of
the
country
and
others
again
played
at
dice
or
such
games
as
might
serve
to
consume
the
time
the
company
were
of
various
ranks
from
those
who
were
apparently
wealthy
and
well
appointed
to
some
whose
garments
and
manners
indicated
that
they
were
but
just
beyond
the
grasp
of
poverty
a
begging
friar
a
man
apparently
of
a
gay
and
pleasant
temper
approached
philipson
and
engaged
him
in
conversation
the
englishman
was
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
world
to
be
aware
that
whatever
of
his
character
and
purpose
it
was
desirable
to
conceal
would
be
best
hidden
under
a
sociable
and
open
demeanour
he
therefore
received
the
friar
approaches
graciously
and
conversed
with
him
upon
the
state
of
lorraine
and
the
interest
which
the
duke
of
attempt
to
seize
that
fief
into
his
own
hands
was
likely
to
create
both
in
france
and
germany
on
these
subjects
satisfied
with
hearing
his
sentiments
philipson
expressed
no
opinion
of
his
own
but
after
receiving
such
intelligence
as
the
friar
chose
to
communicate
preferred
rather
to
talk
upon
the
geography
of
the
country
the
facilities
afforded
to
commerce
and
the
rules
which
obstructed
or
favoured
trade
while
he
was
thus
engaged
in
the
conversation
which
seemed
most
to
belong
to
his
profession
the
landlord
suddenly
entered
the
room
and
mounting
on
the
head
of
an
old
barrel
glanced
his
eye
slowly
and
steadily
round
the
crowded
apartment
and
when
he
had
completed
his
survey
pronounced
in
a
decisive
tone
the
double
command
shut
the
gates
spread
the
table
the
baron
antonio
be
praised
said
the
friar
our
landlord
has
given
up
hope
of
any
more
guests
until
which
blessed
time
we
might
have
starved
for
want
of
food
before
he
had
relieved
us
ay
here
comes
the
cloth
the
old
gates
of
the
courtyard
are
now
bolted
fast
enough
and
when
johann
mengs
has
once
said
the
gates
the
stranger
may
knock
on
the
outside
as
he
will
but
we
may
rest
assured
that
it
shall
not
be
opened
to
him
meinherr
mengs
maintains
strict
discipline
in
his
house
said
the
englishman
as
absolute
as
the
duke
of
burgundy
answered
the
friar
after
ten
no
admittance
the
another
inn
which
is
before
that
a
conditional
hint
becomes
after
the
clock
has
struck
and
the
watchmen
have
begun
their
rounds
an
absolute
order
of
exclusion
he
that
is
without
remains
without
and
he
that
is
within
must
in
like
manner
continue
there
until
the
gates
open
at
break
of
day
till
then
the
house
is
almost
like
a
beleaguered
citadel
john
mengs
its
seneschal
and
we
its
captives
good
father
said
philipson
well
content
am
i
a
wise
traveller
must
submit
to
the
control
of
the
leaders
of
the
people
when
he
travels
and
i
hope
a
goodly
fat
potentate
like
john
mengs
will
be
as
clement
as
his
station
and
dignity
admit
of
while
they
were
talking
in
this
manner
the
aged
waiter
with
many
a
weary
sigh
and
many
a
groan
had
drawn
out
certain
boards
by
which
a
table
that
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
had
the
capacity
of
being
extended
so
as
to
contain
the
company
present
and
covered
it
with
a
cloth
which
was
neither
distinguished
by
extreme
cleanliness
nor
fineness
of
texture
on
this
table
when
it
had
been
accommodated
to
receive
the
necessary
number
of
guests
a
wooden
trencher
and
spoon
together
with
a
glass
were
placed
before
each
he
being
expected
to
serve
himself
with
his
own
knife
for
the
other
purposes
of
the
table
as
for
forks
they
were
unknown
until
a
much
later
period
all
the
europeans
of
that
day
making
the
same
use
of
the
fingers
to
select
their
morsels
and
transport
them
to
the
mouth
which
the
asiatics
now
practise
the
board
was
no
sooner
arranged
than
the
hungry
guests
hastened
to
occupy
their
seats
around
it
for
which
purpose
the
sleepers
were
awakened
the
dicers
resigned
their
game
and
the
idlers
and
politicians
broke
off
their
sage
debates
in
order
to
secure
their
station
at
the
and
be
ready
to
perform
their
part
in
the
interesting
solemnity
which
seemed
about
to
take
place
but
there
is
much
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
and
not
less
sometimes
between
the
covering
of
a
table
and
the
placing
food
upon
it
the
guests
sat
in
order
each
with
his
knife
drawn
already
menacing
the
victuals
which
were
still
subject
to
the
operations
of
the
cook
they
had
waited
with
various
degrees
of
patience
for
full
half
an
hour
when
at
length
the
old
attendant
before
mentioned
entered
with
a
pitcher
of
thin
moselle
wine
so
light
and
so
that
philipson
put
down
his
cup
with
every
tooth
in
his
head
set
on
edge
by
the
slender
portion
which
he
had
swallowed
the
landlord
john
mengs
who
had
assumed
a
seat
somewhat
elevated
at
the
head
of
the
table
did
not
omit
to
observe
this
mark
of
insubordination
and
to
animadvert
upon
it
the
wine
likes
you
not
i
think
my
master
said
he
to
the
english
merchant
for
wine
no
answered
philipson
but
could
i
see
anything
requiring
such
sauce
i
have
seldom
seen
better
vinegar
this
jest
though
uttered
in
the
most
calm
and
composed
manner
seemed
to
drive
the
innkeeper
to
fury
who
are
you
he
exclaimed
for
a
foreign
pedlar
that
ventures
to
quarrel
with
my
wine
which
has
been
approved
of
by
so
many
princes
dukes
reigning
dukes
graves
rhinegraves
counts
barons
and
knights
of
the
empire
whose
shoes
you
are
altogether
unworthy
even
to
clean
was
it
not
of
this
wine
that
the
count
palatine
of
nimmersatt
drank
six
quarts
before
he
ever
rose
from
the
blessed
chair
in
which
i
now
sit
i
doubt
it
not
mine
host
said
philipson
nor
should
i
think
of
scandalising
the
sobriety
of
your
honourable
guest
even
if
he
had
drunken
twice
the
quantity
silence
thou
malicious
railer
said
the
host
and
let
instant
apology
be
made
to
me
and
the
wine
which
you
have
calumniated
or
i
will
instantly
command
the
supper
to
be
postponed
till
midnight
here
there
was
a
general
alarm
among
the
guests
all
abjuring
any
part
in
the
censures
of
philipson
and
most
of
them
proposing
that
john
mengs
should
avenge
himself
on
the
actual
culprit
by
turning
him
instantly
out
of
doors
rather
than
involve
so
many
innocent
and
famished
persons
in
the
consequences
of
his
guilt
the
wine
they
pronounced
excellent
some
two
or
three
even
drank
their
glass
out
to
make
their
words
good
and
they
all
offered
if
not
with
lives
and
fortunes
at
least
with
hands
and
feet
to
support
the
ban
of
the
house
against
the
contumacious
englishman
while
petition
and
remonstrance
were
assailing
john
mengs
on
every
side
the
friar
like
a
wise
counsellor
and
a
trusty
friend
endeavoured
to
end
the
feud
by
advising
philipson
to
submit
to
the
host
sovereignty
humble
thyself
my
son
he
said
bend
the
stubbornness
of
thy
heart
before
the
great
lord
of
the
spigot
and
butt
i
speak
for
the
sake
of
others
as
well
as
my
own
for
heaven
alone
knows
how
much
longer
they
or
i
can
endure
this
extenuating
fast
worthy
guests
said
philipson
i
am
grieved
to
have
offended
our
respected
host
and
am
so
far
from
objecting
to
the
wine
that
i
will
pay
for
a
double
flagon
of
it
to
be
served
all
round
to
this
honourable
company
so
only
they
do
not
ask
me
to
share
of
it
these
last
words
were
spoken
aside
but
the
englishman
could
not
fail
to
perceive
from
the
wry
mouths
of
some
of
the
party
who
were
possessed
of
a
nicer
palate
that
they
were
as
much
afraid
as
himself
of
a
repetition
of
the
acid
potation
the
friar
next
addressed
the
company
with
a
proposal
that
the
foreign
merchant
instead
of
being
amerced
in
a
measure
of
the
liquor
which
he
had
scandalised
should
be
mulcted
in
an
equal
quantity
of
the
more
generous
wines
which
were
usually
produced
after
the
repast
had
been
concluded
in
this
mine
host
as
well
as
the
guests
found
their
advantage
and
as
philipson
made
no
objection
the
proposal
was
unanimously
adopted
and
john
mengs
gave
from
his
seat
of
dignity
the
signal
for
supper
to
be
served
the
meal
appeared
and
there
was
twice
as
much
time
employed
in
consuming
as
there
had
been
in
expecting
it
the
articles
of
which
the
supper
consisted
as
well
as
the
mode
of
serving
them
up
were
as
much
calculated
to
try
the
patience
of
the
company
as
the
delay
which
had
preceded
its
appearance
messes
of
broth
and
vegetables
followed
in
succession
with
platters
of
meat
sodden
and
roasted
of
which
each
in
its
turn
took
a
formal
course
around
the
ample
table
and
was
specially
subjected
to
every
one
in
rotation
hung
beef
dried
fish
also
made
the
circuit
with
various
condiments
called
botargo
caviare
and
similar
names
composed
of
the
roes
of
fish
mixed
with
spices
and
the
like
preparations
calculated
to
awaken
thirst
and
encourage
deep
drinking
flagons
of
wine
accompanied
these
stimulating
dainties
the
liquor
was
so
superior
in
flavour
and
strength
to
the
ordinary
wine
which
had
awakened
so
much
controversy
that
it
might
be
objected
to
on
the
opposite
account
being
so
heady
fiery
and
strong
that
in
spite
of
the
rebuffs
which
his
criticism
had
already
procured
philipson
ventured
to
ask
for
some
cold
water
to
allay
it
you
are
too
difficult
to
please
sir
guest
replied
the
landlord
again
bending
upon
the
englishman
a
stern
and
offended
brow
if
you
find
the
wine
too
strong
in
my
house
the
secret
to
allay
its
strength
is
to
drink
the
less
it
is
indifferent
to
us
whether
you
drink
or
not
so
you
pay
the
reckoning
of
those
good
fellows
who
do
and
he
laughed
a
gruff
laugh
philipson
was
about
to
reply
but
the
friar
retaining
his
character
of
mediator
plucked
him
by
the
cloak
and
entreated
him
to
forbear
you
do
not
understand
the
ways
of
the
place
said
he
it
is
not
here
as
in
the
hostelries
of
england
and
france
where
each
guest
calls
for
what
he
desires
for
his
own
use
and
where
he
pays
for
what
he
has
required
and
for
no
more
here
we
proceed
on
a
broad
principle
of
equality
and
fraternity
no
one
asks
for
anything
in
particular
but
such
provisions
as
the
host
thinks
sufficient
are
set
down
before
all
indiscriminately
and
as
with
the
feast
so
is
it
with
the
reckoning
all
pay
their
proportions
alike
without
reference
to
the
quantity
of
wine
which
one
may
have
swallowed
more
than
another
and
thus
the
sick
and
infirm
nay
the
female
and
the
child
pay
the
same
as
the
hungry
peasant
and
strolling
it
seems
an
unequal
custom
said
philipson
but
travellers
are
not
to
judge
so
that
when
a
reckoning
is
called
every
one
i
am
to
understand
pays
alike
such
is
the
rule
said
the
friar
excepting
perhaps
some
poor
brother
of
our
own
order
whom
our
lady
and
francis
send
into
such
a
scene
as
this
that
good
christians
may
bestow
their
alms
upon
him
and
so
make
a
step
on
their
road
to
heaven
the
first
words
of
this
speech
were
spoken
in
the
open
and
independent
tone
in
which
the
friar
had
begun
the
conversation
the
last
sentence
died
away
into
the
professional
whine
of
mendicity
proper
to
the
convent
and
at
once
apprised
philipson
at
what
price
he
was
to
pay
for
the
friar
counsel
and
mediation
having
thus
explained
the
custom
of
the
country
good
father
gratian
turned
to
illustrate
it
by
his
example
and
having
no
objection
to
the
new
service
of
wine
on
account
of
its
strength
he
seemed
well
disposed
to
signalise
himself
amongst
some
stout
topers
who
by
drinking
deeply
appeared
determined
to
have
full
pennyworths
for
their
share
of
the
reckoning
the
good
wine
gradually
did
its
office
and
even
the
host
relaxed
his
sullen
and
grim
features
and
smiled
to
see
the
kindling
flame
of
hilarity
catch
from
one
to
another
and
at
length
embrace
almost
all
the
numerous
guests
at
the
table
except
a
few
who
were
too
temperate
to
partake
deeply
of
the
wine
or
too
fastidious
to
enter
into
the
discussions
to
which
it
gave
rise
on
these
the
host
cast
from
time
to
time
a
sullen
and
displeased
eye
philipson
who
was
reserved
and
silent
both
in
consequence
of
his
abstinence
from
the
and
his
unwillingness
to
mix
in
conversation
with
strangers
was
looked
upon
by
the
landlord
as
a
defaulter
in
both
particulars
and
as
he
aroused
his
own
sluggish
nature
with
the
fiery
wine
mengs
began
to
throw
out
obscure
hints
about
and
such
like
epithets
which
were
plainly
directed
against
the
englishman
philipson
replied
with
the
utmost
equanimity
that
he
was
perfectly
sensible
that
his
spirits
did
not
at
this
moment
render
him
an
agreeable
member
of
a
merry
company
and
that
with
the
leave
of
those
present
he
would
withdraw
to
his
and
wish
them
all
a
good
evening
and
continuance
to
their
mirth
but
this
very
reasonable
proposal
as
it
might
have
elsewhere
seemed
contained
in
it
treason
against
the
laws
of
german
compotation
who
are
you
said
john
mengs
who
presume
to
leave
the
table
before
the
reckoning
is
called
and
settled
sapperment
der
teufel
we
are
not
men
upon
whom
such
an
offence
is
to
be
put
with
impunity
you
may
exhibit
your
polite
pranks
in
if
you
will
or
in
eastcheap
or
in
smithfield
but
it
shall
not
be
in
john
mengs
golden
fleece
nor
will
i
suffer
one
guest
to
go
to
bed
to
blink
out
of
the
reckoning
and
so
cheat
me
and
all
the
rest
of
my
company
philipson
looked
round
to
gather
the
sentiments
of
the
company
but
saw
no
encouragement
to
appeal
to
their
judgment
indeed
many
of
them
had
little
judgment
left
to
appeal
to
and
those
who
paid
any
attention
to
the
matter
at
all
were
some
quiet
old
soakers
who
were
already
beginning
to
think
of
the
reckoning
and
were
disposed
to
agree
with
the
host
in
considering
the
english
merchant
as
a
flincher
who
was
determined
to
evade
payment
of
what
might
be
drunk
after
he
left
the
room
so
that
john
mengs
received
the
applause
of
the
whole
company
when
he
concluded
his
triumphant
denunciation
against
philipson
yes
sir
you
may
withdraw
if
you
please
but
poz
element
it
shall
not
be
for
this
time
to
seek
for
another
inn
but
to
the
courtyard
shall
you
go
and
no
farther
there
to
make
your
bed
upon
the
stable
litter
and
good
enough
for
the
man
that
will
needs
be
the
first
to
break
up
good
company
it
is
well
said
my
jovial
host
said
a
rich
trader
from
ratisbon
and
here
are
some
six
of
us
more
or
less
who
will
stand
by
you
to
maintain
the
good
old
customs
of
germany
and
the
umph
laudable
and
and
praiseworthy
rules
of
the
golden
fleece
nay
be
not
angry
sir
said
philipson
yourself
and
your
three
companions
whom
the
good
wine
has
multiplied
into
six
shall
have
your
own
way
of
ordering
the
matter
and
since
you
will
not
permit
me
to
go
to
bed
i
trust
that
you
will
take
no
offence
if
i
fall
asleep
in
my
chair
how
say
you
what
think
you
mine
host
said
the
citizen
from
ratisbon
may
the
gentleman
being
drunk
as
you
see
he
is
since
he
can
not
tell
that
three
and
one
make
six
i
say
may
he
being
drunk
sleep
in
the
this
question
introduced
a
contradiction
on
the
part
of
the
host
who
contended
that
three
and
one
made
four
not
six
and
this
again
produced
a
retort
from
the
ratisbon
trader
other
clamours
rose
at
the
same
time
and
were
at
length
with
difficulty
silenced
by
the
stanzas
of
a
chorus
song
of
mirth
and
good
fellowship
which
the
friar
now
become
somewhat
oblivious
of
the
rule
of
francis
thundered
forth
with
better
than
he
ever
sang
a
canticle
of
king
david
under
cover
of
this
tumult
philipson
drew
himself
a
little
aside
and
though
he
felt
it
impossible
to
sleep
as
he
had
proposed
was
yet
enabled
to
escape
the
reproachful
glances
with
which
john
mengs
distinguished
all
those
who
did
not
call
for
wine
loudly
and
drink
it
lustily
his
thoughts
roamed
far
from
the
of
the
golden
fleece
and
upon
matter
very
different
from
that
which
was
discussed
around
him
when
his
attention
was
suddenly
recalled
by
a
loud
and
continued
knocking
on
the
door
of
the
hostelry
what
have
we
here
said
john
mengs
his
nose
reddening
with
very
indignation
who
the
foul
fiend
presses
on
the
golden
fleece
at
such
an
hour
as
if
he
thundered
at
the
door
of
a
bordel
to
the
turret
window
some
one
geoffrey
knave
ostler
or
thou
old
timothy
tell
the
rash
man
there
is
no
admittance
into
the
golden
fleece
save
at
timeous
hours
the
men
went
as
they
were
directed
and
might
be
heard
in
the
vying
with
each
other
in
the
positive
denial
which
they
gave
to
the
guest
who
was
pressing
for
admission
they
returned
however
to
inform
their
master
that
they
were
unable
to
overcome
the
obstinacy
of
the
stranger
who
refused
positively
to
depart
until
he
had
an
interview
with
mengs
himself
wroth
was
the
master
of
the
golden
fleece
at
this
pertinacity
and
his
indignation
extended
like
a
fiery
exhalation
from
his
nose
all
over
the
adjacent
regions
of
his
cheeks
and
brow
he
started
from
his
chair
grasped
in
his
hand
a
stout
stick
which
seemed
his
ordinary
sceptre
or
leading
staff
of
command
and
muttering
something
concerning
cudgels
for
the
shoulders
of
fools
and
pitchers
of
fair
or
foul
water
for
the
drenching
of
their
ears
he
marched
off
to
the
window
which
looked
into
the
court
and
left
his
guests
nodding
winking
and
whispering
to
each
other
in
full
expectation
of
hearing
the
active
demonstrations
of
his
wrath
it
happened
otherwise
however
for
after
the
exchange
of
a
few
indistinct
words
they
were
astonished
when
they
heard
the
noise
of
the
unbolting
and
unbarring
of
the
gates
of
the
inn
and
presently
after
the
footsteps
of
men
upon
the
stairs
and
the
landlord
entering
with
an
appearance
of
clumsy
courtesy
prayed
those
assembled
to
make
room
for
an
honoured
guest
who
came
though
late
to
add
to
their
numbers
a
tall
dark
form
followed
muffled
in
a
on
laying
aside
which
philipson
at
once
recognised
his
late
the
black
priest
of
paul
there
was
in
the
circumstance
itself
nothing
at
all
surprising
since
it
was
natural
that
a
landlord
however
coarse
and
insolent
to
ordinary
guests
might
yet
show
deference
to
an
ecclesiastic
whether
from
his
rank
in
the
church
or
from
his
reputation
for
sanctity
but
what
did
appear
surprising
to
philipson
was
the
effect
produced
by
the
entrance
of
this
unexpected
guest
he
seated
himself
without
hesitation
at
the
highest
place
of
the
board
from
which
john
mengs
had
dethroned
the
aforesaid
trader
from
ratisbon
notwithstanding
his
zeal
for
ancient
german
customs
his
steady
adherence
and
loyalty
to
the
golden
fleece
and
his
propensity
to
brimming
goblets
the
priest
took
instant
and
unscrupulous
possession
of
his
seat
of
honour
after
some
negligent
reply
to
the
host
unwonted
courtesy
when
it
seemed
that
the
effect
of
his
long
black
vestments
in
place
of
the
slashed
and
flounced
coat
of
his
predecessor
as
well
as
of
the
cold
grey
eye
with
which
he
slowly
reviewed
the
company
in
some
degree
resembled
that
of
the
fabulous
gorgon
and
if
it
did
not
literally
convert
those
who
looked
upon
it
into
stone
there
was
yet
something
petrifying
in
the
steady
unmoved
glance
with
which
he
seemed
to
survey
them
looking
as
if
desirous
of
reading
their
very
inmost
souls
and
passing
from
one
to
another
as
if
each
upon
whom
he
looked
in
succession
was
unworthy
of
longer
consideration
philipson
felt
in
his
turn
that
momentary
examination
in
which
however
there
mingled
nothing
that
seemed
to
convey
recognition
all
the
courage
and
composure
of
the
englishman
could
not
prevent
an
unpleasant
feeling
while
under
this
mysterious
man
eye
so
that
he
felt
a
relief
when
it
passed
from
him
and
rested
upon
another
of
the
company
who
seemed
in
turn
to
acknowledge
the
chilling
effects
of
that
freezing
glance
the
noise
of
intoxicated
mirth
and
drunken
disputation
the
clamorous
argument
and
the
still
more
boisterous
laugh
which
had
been
suspended
on
the
priest
entering
the
now
after
one
or
two
vain
attempts
to
resume
them
died
away
as
if
the
feast
had
been
changed
to
a
funeral
and
the
jovial
guests
had
been
at
once
converted
into
the
lugubrious
mutes
who
attend
on
such
solemnities
one
little
man
who
afterwards
proved
to
be
a
tailor
from
augsburg
ambitious
perhaps
of
showing
a
degree
of
courage
not
usually
supposed
consistent
with
his
effeminate
trade
made
a
bold
effort
and
yet
it
was
with
a
timid
and
restrained
voice
that
he
called
on
the
jovial
friar
to
renew
his
song
but
whether
it
was
that
he
did
not
dare
to
venture
on
an
uncanonical
pastime
in
presence
of
a
brother
in
orders
or
whether
he
had
some
other
reason
for
declining
the
invitation
the
merry
churchman
hung
his
head
and
shook
it
with
such
an
expressive
air
of
melancholy
that
the
tailor
drew
back
as
if
he
had
been
detected
in
cabbaging
from
a
cardinal
robes
or
cribbing
the
lace
of
some
cope
or
altar
gown
in
short
the
revel
was
hushed
into
deep
silence
and
so
attentive
were
the
company
to
what
should
arrive
next
that
the
bells
of
the
village
church
striking
the
first
hour
after
midnight
made
the
guests
start
as
if
they
heard
them
rung
backwards
to
announce
an
assault
or
conflagration
the
black
priest
who
had
taken
some
slight
and
hasty
repast
which
the
host
had
made
no
kind
of
objection
to
supplying
him
with
seemed
to
think
the
bells
which
announced
the
service
of
lauds
being
the
first
after
midnight
a
proper
signal
for
breaking
up
the
party
we
have
eaten
he
said
that
we
may
support
life
let
us
pray
that
we
may
be
fit
to
meet
death
which
waits
upon
life
as
surely
as
night
upon
day
or
the
shadow
upon
the
sunbeam
though
we
know
not
when
or
from
whence
it
is
to
come
upon
us
the
company
as
if
mechanically
bent
their
uncovered
heads
while
the
priest
said
with
his
deep
and
solemn
voice
a
latin
prayer
expressing
thanks
to
god
for
protection
throughout
the
day
and
entreating
for
its
continuance
during
the
witching
hours
which
were
to
pass
ere
the
day
again
commenced
the
hearers
bowed
their
heads
in
token
of
acquiescence
in
the
holy
petition
and
when
they
raised
them
the
black
priest
of
paul
had
followed
the
host
out
of
the
apartment
probably
to
that
which
was
destined
for
his
repose
his
absence
was
no
sooner
perceived
than
signs
and
nods
and
even
whispers
were
exchanged
between
the
guests
but
no
one
spoke
above
his
breath
or
in
such
connected
manner
as
that
philipson
could
understand
anything
distinctly
from
them
he
himself
ventured
to
ask
the
friar
who
sat
near
him
observing
at
the
same
time
the
which
seemed
to
be
fashionable
for
the
moment
whether
the
worthy
ecclesiastic
who
had
left
them
was
not
the
priest
of
paul
on
the
frontier
town
of
la
ferette
and
if
you
know
it
is
he
said
the
friar
with
a
countenance
and
a
tone
from
which
all
signs
of
intoxication
were
suddenly
banished
why
do
you
ask
of
me
because
said
the
merchant
i
would
willingly
learn
the
spell
which
so
suddenly
converted
so
many
merry
tipplers
into
men
of
sober
manners
and
a
jovial
company
into
a
convent
of
carthusian
friars
friend
said
the
friar
thy
discourse
savoureth
mightily
of
asking
after
what
thou
knowest
right
well
but
i
am
no
such
silly
duck
as
to
be
taken
by
a
decoy
if
thou
knowest
the
black
priest
thou
canst
not
be
ignorant
of
the
terrors
which
attend
his
presence
and
that
it
were
safer
to
pass
a
broad
jest
in
the
holy
house
of
loretto
than
where
he
shows
himself
so
saying
and
as
if
desirous
of
avoiding
further
discourse
he
withdrew
to
a
distance
from
philipson
at
the
same
moment
the
landlord
again
appeared
and
with
more
of
the
usual
manners
of
a
publican
than
he
had
hitherto
exhibited
commanded
his
waiter
geoffrey
to
hand
round
to
the
company
a
or
of
distilled
water
mingled
with
spices
which
was
indeed
as
good
as
philipson
himself
had
ever
tasted
john
mengs
in
the
meanwhile
with
somewhat
of
more
deference
expressed
to
his
guests
a
hope
that
his
entertainment
had
given
satisfaction
but
this
was
in
so
careless
a
manner
and
he
seemed
so
conscious
of
deserving
the
affirmative
which
was
expressed
on
all
hands
that
it
became
obvious
there
was
very
little
humility
in
proposing
the
question
the
old
man
timothy
was
in
the
meantime
mustering
the
guests
and
marking
with
chalk
on
the
bottom
of
a
trencher
the
reckoning
the
particulars
of
which
were
indicated
by
certain
conventional
hieroglyphics
while
he
showed
on
another
the
division
of
the
sum
total
among
the
company
and
proceeded
to
collect
an
equal
share
of
it
from
each
when
the
fatal
trencher
in
which
each
man
paid
down
his
money
approached
the
jolly
friar
his
countenance
seemed
to
be
somewhat
changed
he
cast
a
piteous
look
towards
philipson
as
the
person
from
whom
he
had
the
most
hope
of
relief
and
our
merchant
though
displeased
with
the
manner
in
which
he
had
held
back
from
his
confidence
yet
not
unwilling
in
a
strange
country
to
incur
a
little
expense
in
the
hope
of
making
a
useful
acquaintance
discharged
the
mendicant
score
as
well
as
his
own
the
poor
friar
paid
his
thanks
in
many
a
blessing
in
good
german
and
bad
latin
but
the
host
cut
them
short
for
approaching
philipson
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
he
offered
his
own
services
to
show
him
where
he
might
sleep
and
even
had
the
condescension
to
carry
his
mail
or
portmanteau
with
his
own
landlordly
hands
you
take
too
much
trouble
mine
host
said
the
merchant
somewhat
surprised
at
the
change
in
the
manner
of
john
mengs
who
had
hitherto
contradicted
him
at
every
word
i
can
not
take
too
much
pains
for
a
guest
was
the
reply
whom
my
venerable
friend
the
priest
of
paul
hath
especially
recommended
to
my
charge
he
then
opened
the
door
of
a
small
bedroom
prepared
for
the
occupation
of
a
guest
and
said
to
philipson
here
you
may
rest
till
at
what
hour
you
will
and
for
as
many
days
more
as
you
incline
the
key
will
secure
your
wares
against
theft
or
pillage
of
any
kind
i
do
not
this
for
every
one
for
if
my
guests
were
every
one
to
have
a
bed
to
himself
the
next
thing
they
would
demand
might
be
a
separate
table
and
then
there
would
be
an
end
of
the
good
old
german
customs
and
we
should
be
as
foppish
and
frivolous
as
our
neighbours
he
placed
the
portmanteau
on
the
floor
and
seemed
about
to
leave
the
apartment
when
turning
about
he
began
a
sort
of
apology
for
the
rudeness
of
his
former
behaviour
i
trust
there
is
no
misunderstanding
between
us
my
worthy
guest
you
might
as
well
expect
to
see
one
of
our
bears
come
aloft
and
do
tricks
like
a
jackanapes
as
one
of
us
stubborn
old
germans
play
the
feats
of
a
french
or
an
italian
host
yet
i
pray
you
to
note
that
if
our
behaviour
is
rude
our
charges
are
honest
and
our
articles
what
they
profess
to
be
we
do
not
expect
to
make
moselle
pass
for
rhenish
by
dint
of
a
bow
and
a
grin
nor
will
we
sauce
your
mess
with
poison
like
the
wily
italian
and
call
you
all
the
time
illustrissimo
and
magnifico
he
seemed
in
these
words
to
have
exhausted
his
rhetoric
for
when
they
were
spoken
he
turned
abruptly
and
left
the
apartment
philipson
was
thus
deprived
of
another
opportunity
to
inquire
who
or
what
this
ecclesiastic
could
be
that
had
exercised
such
influence
on
all
who
approached
him
he
felt
indeed
no
desire
to
prolong
a
conference
with
john
mengs
though
he
had
laid
aside
in
such
a
considerable
degree
his
rude
and
repulsive
manners
yet
he
longed
to
know
who
this
man
could
be
who
had
power
with
a
word
to
turn
aside
the
daggers
of
alsatian
banditti
habituated
as
they
were
like
most
borderers
to
robbery
and
pillage
and
to
change
into
civility
the
proverbial
rudeness
of
a
german
innkeeper
such
were
the
reflections
of
philipson
as
he
doffed
his
clothes
to
take
his
repose
after
a
day
of
fatigue
danger
and
difficulty
on
the
pallet
afforded
by
the
hospitality
of
the
golden
fleece
in
the
chapter
ii
how
now
ye
secret
black
and
midnight
hags
what
ye
do
a
deed
without
a
name
we
have
said
in
the
conclusion
of
the
last
chapter
that
after
a
day
of
unwonted
fatigue
and
extraordinary
excitation
the
merchant
philipson
naturally
expected
to
forget
so
many
agitating
passages
in
that
deep
and
profound
repose
which
is
at
once
the
consequence
and
the
cure
of
extreme
exhaustion
but
he
was
no
sooner
laid
on
his
lowly
pallet
than
he
felt
that
the
bodily
machine
by
so
much
exercise
was
little
disposed
to
the
charms
of
sleep
the
mind
had
been
too
much
excited
the
body
was
far
too
feverish
to
suffer
him
to
partake
of
needful
rest
his
anxiety
about
the
safety
of
his
son
his
conjectures
concerning
the
issue
of
his
mission
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
a
thousand
other
thoughts
which
recalled
past
events
or
speculated
on
those
which
were
to
come
rushed
upon
his
mind
like
the
waves
of
a
perturbed
sea
and
prevented
all
tendency
to
repose
he
had
been
in
bed
about
an
hour
and
sleep
had
not
yet
approached
his
couch
when
he
felt
that
the
pallet
on
which
he
lay
was
sinking
below
him
and
that
he
was
in
the
act
of
descending
along
with
it
he
knew
not
whither
the
sound
of
ropes
and
pulleys
was
also
indistinctly
heard
though
every
caution
had
been
taken
to
make
them
run
smooth
and
the
traveller
by
feeling
around
him
became
sensible
that
he
and
the
bed
on
which
he
lay
had
been
spread
upon
a
large
which
was
capable
of
being
let
down
into
the
vaults
or
apartments
beneath
philipson
felt
fear
in
circumstances
so
well
qualified
to
produce
it
for
how
could
he
hope
a
safe
termination
to
an
adventure
which
had
begun
so
strangely
but
his
apprehensions
were
those
of
a
brave
man
who
even
in
the
extremity
of
danger
which
appeared
to
surround
him
preserved
his
presence
of
mind
his
descent
seemed
to
be
cautiously
managed
and
he
held
himself
in
readiness
to
start
to
his
feet
and
defend
himself
as
soon
as
he
should
be
once
more
upon
firm
ground
although
somewhat
advanced
in
years
he
was
a
man
of
great
personal
vigour
and
activity
and
unless
taken
at
advantage
which
no
doubt
was
at
present
much
to
be
apprehended
he
was
likely
to
make
a
formidable
defence
his
plan
of
resistance
however
had
been
anticipated
he
no
sooner
reached
the
bottom
of
the
vault
down
to
which
he
was
lowered
than
two
men
who
had
been
waiting
there
till
the
operation
was
completed
laid
hands
on
him
from
either
side
and
forcibly
preventing
him
from
starting
up
as
he
intended
cast
a
rope
over
his
arms
and
made
him
a
prisoner
as
effectually
as
when
he
was
in
the
dungeons
of
la
ferette
he
was
obliged
therefore
to
remain
passive
and
unresisting
and
await
the
termination
of
this
formidable
adventure
secured
as
he
was
he
could
only
turn
his
head
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
it
was
with
joy
that
he
at
length
saw
lights
twinkle
but
they
appeared
at
a
great
distance
from
him
from
the
irregular
manner
in
which
these
scattered
lights
advanced
sometimes
keeping
a
straight
line
sometimes
mixing
and
crossing
each
other
it
might
be
inferred
that
the
subterranean
vault
in
which
they
appeared
was
of
very
considerable
extent
their
number
also
increased
and
as
they
collected
more
together
philipson
could
perceive
that
the
lights
proceeded
from
many
torches
borne
by
men
muffled
in
black
cloaks
like
mourners
at
a
funeral
or
the
black
friars
of
francis
order
wearing
their
cowls
drawn
over
their
heads
so
as
to
conceal
their
features
they
appeared
anxiously
engaged
in
measuring
off
a
portion
of
the
apartment
and
while
occupied
in
that
employment
they
sang
in
the
ancient
german
language
rhymes
more
rude
than
philipson
could
well
understand
but
which
may
be
imitated
thus
measurers
of
good
and
evil
bring
the
square

to

answer
brethren
all
and
one
is
the
ritual
rightly
done
a
deep
chorus
seemed
to
reply
to
the
question
many
voices
joined
in
it
as
well
of
persons
already
in
the
subterranean
vault
as
of
others
who
as
yet
remained
without
in
various
galleries
and
passages
which
communicated
with
it
and
whom
philipson
now
presumed
to
be
very
numerous
the
answer
chanted
ran
as
follows
on
life
and
soul
on
blood
and
bone
one
for
all
and
all
for
one
we
warrant
this
is
rightly
done
the
original
strain
was
then
renewed
in
the
same
manner
as
before
how
wears
the
night
doth
morning
shine
in
early
radiance
on
the
rhine
what
music
floats
upon
his
tide
do
birds
the
tardy
morning
chide
brethren
look
out
from
hill
and
height
and
answer
true
how
wears
the
night
the
answer
was
returned
though
less
loud
than
at
first
and
it
seemed
that
those
by
whom
the
reply
was
given
were
at
a
much
greater
distance
than
before
yet
the
words
were
distinctly
heard
the
night
is
old
on
rhine
broad
breast
glance
drowsy
stars
which
long
to
rest
no
beams
are
twinkling
in
the
east
there
is
a
voice
upon
the
flood
the
stern
still
call
of
blood
for
blood
is
time
we
listen
the
behest
the
chorus
replied
with
many
additional
voices
up
then
up
when
day
at
rest
is
time
that
such
as
we
are
watchers
rise
to
judgment
brethren
rise
vengeance
knows
not
sleepy
eyes
he
and
night
are
matchers
the
nature
of
the
verses
soon
led
philipson
to
comprehend
that
he
was
in
presence
of
the
initiated
or
the
wise
men
names
which
were
applied
to
the
celebrated
judges
of
the
secret
tribunal
which
continued
at
that
period
to
subsist
in
suabia
franconia
and
other
districts
of
the
east
of
germany
which
was
called
perhaps
from
the
frightful
and
frequent
occurrence
of
executions
by
command
of
those
invisible
judges
the
red
land
philipson
had
often
heard
that
the
seat
of
a
free
count
or
chief
of
the
secret
tribunal
was
secretly
instituted
even
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
and
that
it
maintained
itself
in
alsace
with
the
usual
tenacity
of
those
secret
societies
though
duke
charles
of
burgundy
had
expressed
a
desire
to
discover
and
discourage
its
influence
so
far
as
was
possible
without
exposing
himself
to
danger
from
the
thousands
of
poniards
which
that
mysterious
tribunal
could
put
in
activity
against
his
own
life
an
awful
means
of
defence
which
for
a
long
time
rendered
it
extremely
hazardous
for
the
sovereigns
of
germany
and
even
the
emperors
themselves
to
put
down
by
authority
those
singular
associations
so
soon
as
this
explanation
flashed
on
the
mind
of
philipson
it
gave
some
clue
to
the
character
and
condition
of
the
black
priest
of
paul
supposing
him
to
be
a
president
or
chief
official
of
the
secret
association
there
was
little
wonder
that
he
should
confide
so
much
in
the
inviolability
of
his
terrible
office
as
to
propose
vindicating
the
execution
of
de
hagenbach
that
his
presence
should
surprise
bartholomew
whom
he
had
power
to
have
judged
and
executed
upon
the
spot
and
that
his
mere
appearance
at
supper
on
the
preceding
evening
should
have
appalled
the
guests
for
though
everything
about
the
institution
its
proceedings
and
its
officers
was
preserved
in
as
much
obscurity
as
is
now
practised
in
yet
the
secret
was
not
so
absolutely
well
kept
as
to
prevent
certain
individuals
from
being
guessed
or
hinted
at
as
men
initiated
and
intrusted
with
high
authority
by
the
or
tribunal
of
the
bounds
when
such
suspicion
attached
to
an
individual
his
secret
power
and
supposed
acquaintance
with
all
guilt
however
secret
which
was
committed
within
the
society
in
which
he
was
conversant
made
him
at
once
the
dread
and
hatred
of
every
one
who
looked
on
him
and
he
enjoyed
a
high
degree
of
personal
respect
on
the
same
terms
on
which
it
would
have
been
yielded
to
a
powerful
enchanter
or
a
dreaded
genie
in
conversing
with
such
a
person
it
was
especially
necessary
to
abstain
from
all
questions
alluding
however
remotely
to
the
office
which
he
bore
in
the
secret
tribunal
and
indeed
to
testify
the
least
curiosity
upon
a
subject
so
solemn
and
mysterious
was
sure
to
occasion
some
misfortune
to
the
inquisitive
person
all
these
things
rushed
at
once
upon
the
mind
of
the
englishman
who
felt
that
he
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
an
unsparing
tribunal
whose
proceedings
were
so
much
dreaded
by
those
who
resided
within
the
circle
of
their
power
that
the
friendless
stranger
must
stand
a
poor
chance
of
receiving
justice
at
their
hands
whatever
might
be
his
consciousness
of
innocence
while
philipson
made
this
melancholy
reflection
he
resolved
at
the
same
time
not
to
forsake
his
own
cause
but
defend
himself
as
he
best
might
conscious
as
he
was
that
these
terrible
and
irresponsible
judges
were
nevertheless
governed
by
certain
rules
of
right
and
wrong
which
formed
a
check
on
the
rigours
of
their
extraordinary
code
illustration
the
secret
tribunal
drawn
and
etched
by
de
los
rios
he
lay
therefore
devising
the
best
means
of
obviating
the
present
danger
while
the
persons
whom
he
beheld
glimmered
before
him
less
like
distinct
and
individual
forms
than
like
the
phantoms
of
a
fever
or
the
phantasmagoria
with
which
a
disease
of
the
optic
nerves
has
been
known
to
people
a
sick
man
chamber
at
length
they
assembled
in
the
centre
of
the
apartment
where
they
had
first
appeared
and
seemed
to
arrange
themselves
into
form
and
order
a
great
number
of
black
torches
were
successively
lighted
and
the
scene
became
distinctly
visible
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
philipson
could
now
perceive
one
of
the
altars
which
are
sometimes
to
be
found
in
ancient
subterranean
chapels
but
we
must
pause
in
order
briefly
to
describe
not
the
appearance
only
but
the
nature
and
constitution
of
this
terrible
court
behind
the
altar
which
seemed
to
be
the
central
point
on
which
all
eyes
were
bent
there
were
placed
in
parallel
lines
two
benches
covered
with
black
cloth
each
was
occupied
by
a
number
of
persons
who
seemed
assembled
as
judges
but
those
who
held
the
foremost
bench
were
fewer
and
appeared
of
a
rank
superior
to
those
who
crowded
the
seat
most
remote
from
the
altar
the
first
seemed
to
be
all
men
of
some
consequence
priests
high
in
their
order
knights
or
noblemen
and
notwithstanding
an
appearance
of
equality
which
seemed
to
pervade
this
singular
institution
much
more
weight
was
laid
upon
their
opinion
or
testimonies
they
were
called
free
knights
counts
or
whatever
title
they
might
bear
while
the
inferior
class
of
the
judges
were
only
termed
free
and
worthy
burghers
for
it
must
be
observed
that
the
vehmique
institution
which
was
the
name
that
it
commonly
bore
although
its
power
consisted
in
a
wide
system
of
espionage
and
the
tyrannical
application
of
force
which
acted
upon
it
was
yet
so
rude
were
the
ideas
of
enforcing
public
law
accounted
to
confer
a
privilege
on
the
country
in
which
it
was
received
and
only
freemen
were
allowed
to
experience
its
influence
serfs
and
peasants
could
not
have
a
place
among
the
free
judges
their
assessors
or
assistants
for
there
was
in
this
assembly
even
some
idea
of
trying
the
culprit
by
his
peers
besides
the
dignitaries
who
occupied
the
benches
there
were
others
who
stood
around
and
seemed
to
guard
the
various
entrances
to
the
hall
of
judgment
or
standing
behind
the
seats
on
which
their
superiors
were
ranged
looked
prepared
to
execute
their
commands
these
were
members
of
the
order
though
not
of
the
highest
ranks
schöppen
is
the
name
generally
assigned
to
them
signifying
officials
or
sergeants
of
the
vehmique
court
whose
doom
they
stood
sworn
to
enforce
through
good
report
and
bad
report
against
their
own
nearest
and
most
beloved
as
well
as
in
cases
of
ordinary
malefactors
the
schöppen
or
scabini
as
they
were
termed
in
latin
had
another
horrible
duty
to
perform
that
namely
of
denouncing
to
the
tribunal
whatever
came
under
their
observation
that
might
be
construed
as
an
offence
falling
under
its
cognisance
or
in
their
language
a
crime
against
the
vehme
this
duty
extended
to
the
judges
as
well
as
to
the
assistants
and
was
to
be
discharged
without
respect
of
persons
so
that
to
know
and
wilfully
conceal
the
guilt
of
a
mother
or
brother
inferred
on
the
part
of
the
unfaithful
official
the
same
penalty
as
if
he
himself
had
committed
the
crime
which
his
silence
screened
from
punishment
such
an
institution
could
only
prevail
at
a
time
when
ordinary
means
of
justice
were
excluded
by
the
hand
of
power
and
when
in
order
to
bring
the
guilty
to
punishment
it
required
all
the
influence
and
authority
of
such
a
confederacy
in
no
other
country
than
one
exposed
to
every
species
of
feudal
tyranny
and
deprived
of
every
ordinary
mode
of
obtaining
justice
or
redress
could
such
a
system
have
taken
root
and
flourished
we
must
now
return
to
the
brave
englishman
who
though
feeling
all
the
danger
he
encountered
from
so
tremendous
a
tribunal
maintained
nevertheless
a
dignified
and
unaltered
composure
the
meeting
being
assembled
a
coil
of
ropes
and
a
naked
sword
the
signals
and
emblems
of
vehmique
authority
were
deposited
on
the
altar
where
the
sword
from
its
being
usually
straight
with
a
cross
handle
was
considered
as
representing
the
blessed
emblem
of
christian
redemption
and
the
cord
as
indicating
the
right
of
criminal
jurisdiction
and
capital
punishment
then
the
president
of
the
meeting
who
occupied
the
centre
seat
on
the
foremost
bench
arose
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
symbols
pronounced
aloud
the
formula
expressive
of
the
duty
of
the
tribunal
which
all
the
inferior
judges
and
assistants
repeated
after
him
in
deep
and
hollow
murmurs
i
swear
by
the
holy
trinity
to
aid
and
without
relaxation
in
the
things
belonging
to
the
holy
vehme
to
defend
its
doctrines
and
institutions
against
father
and
mother
brother
and
sister
wife
and
children
against
fire
water
earth
and
air
against
all
that
the
sun
enlightens
against
all
that
the
dew
moistens
against
all
created
things
of
heaven
and
earth
or
the
waters
under
the
earth
and
i
swear
to
give
information
to
this
holy
judicature
of
all
that
i
know
to
be
true
or
hear
repeated
by
credible
testimony
which
by
the
rules
of
the
holy
vehme
is
deserving
of
animadversion
or
punishment
and
that
i
will
not
cloak
cover
or
conceal
such
my
knowledge
neither
for
love
friendship
or
family
affection
nor
for
gold
silver
or
precious
stones
neither
will
i
associate
with
such
as
are
under
the
sentence
of
this
sacred
tribunal
by
hinting
to
a
culprit
his
danger
or
advising
him
to
escape
or
aiding
and
supplying
him
with
counsel
or
means
to
that
effect
neither
will
i
relieve
such
culprit
with
fire
clothes
food
or
shelter
though
my
father
should
require
from
me
a
cup
of
water
in
the
heat
of
summer
noon
or
my
brother
should
request
to
sit
by
my
fire
in
the
bitterest
cold
night
of
winter
and
further
i
vow
and
promise
to
honour
this
holy
association
and
do
its
behests
speedily
faithfully
and
firmly
in
preference
to
those
of
any
other
tribunal
whatsoever
so
help
me
god
and
his
holy
evangelists
when
this
oath
of
office
had
been
taken
the
president
addressing
the
assembly
as
men
who
judge
in
secret
and
punish
in
secret
like
the
deity
desired
them
to
say
why
this
child
of
the
cord
lay
before
them
bound
and
helpless
an
individual
rose
from
the
more
remote
bench
and
in
a
voice
which
though
altered
and
agitated
philipson
conceived
that
he
recognised
declared
himself
the
accuser
as
bound
by
his
oath
of
the
child
of
the
cord
or
prisoner
who
lay
before
them
bring
forward
the
prisoner
said
the
president
duly
secured
as
is
the
order
of
our
secret
law
but
not
with
such
severity
as
may
interrupt
his
attention
to
the
proceedings
of
the
tribunal
or
limit
his
power
of
hearing
and
replying
six
of
the
assistants
immediately
dragged
forward
the
pallet
and
platform
of
boards
on
which
philipson
lay
and
advanced
it
towards
the
foot
of
the
altar
this
done
each
unsheathed
his
dagger
while
two
of
them
unloosed
the
cords
by
which
the
merchant
hands
were
secured
and
admonished
him
in
a
whisper
that
the
slightest
attempt
to
resist
or
escape
would
be
the
signal
to
stab
him
dead
arise
said
the
president
listen
to
the
charge
to
be
preferred
against
you
and
believe
you
shall
in
us
find
judges
equally
just
and
inflexible
philipson
carefully
avoiding
any
gesture
which
might
indicate
a
desire
to
escape
raised
his
body
on
the
lower
part
of
the
couch
and
remained
seated
clothed
as
he
was
in
his
and
or
drawers
so
as
exactly
to
face
the
muffled
president
of
the
terrible
court
even
in
these
agitating
circumstances
the
mind
of
the
undaunted
englishman
remained
unshaken
and
his
eyelid
did
not
quiver
nor
his
heart
beat
quicker
though
he
seemed
according
to
the
expression
of
scripture
to
be
a
pilgrim
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
beset
by
numerous
snares
and
encompassed
by
total
darkness
where
light
was
most
necessary
for
safety
the
president
demanded
his
name
country
and
occupation
john
philipson
was
the
reply
by
birth
an
englishman
by
profession
a
merchant
have
you
ever
borne
any
other
name
and
profession
demanded
the
judge
i
have
been
a
soldier
and
like
most
others
had
then
a
name
by
which
i
was
known
in
war
what
was
that
name
i
laid
it
aside
when
i
resigned
my
sword
and
i
do
not
desire
again
to
be
known
by
it
moreover
i
never
bore
it
where
your
institutions
have
weight
and
authority
answered
the
englishman
know
you
before
whom
you
stand
continued
the
judge
i
may
at
least
guess
replied
the
merchant
tell
your
guess
then
continued
the
interrogator
say
who
we
are
and
wherefore
are
you
before
us
i
believe
that
i
am
before
the
unknown
or
secret
tribunal
which
is
called
then
are
you
aware
answered
the
judge
that
you
would
be
safer
if
you
were
suspended
by
the
hair
over
the
abyss
of
schaffhausen
or
if
you
lay
below
an
axe
which
a
thread
of
silk
alone
kept
back
from
the
fall
what
have
you
done
to
deserve
such
a
fate
let
those
reply
by
whom
i
am
subjected
to
it
answered
philipson
with
the
same
composure
as
before
speak
accuser
said
the
president
to
the
four
quarters
of
heaven
to
the
ears
of
the
free
judges
of
this
tribunal
and
the
faithful
executors
of
their
doom
and
to
the
face
of
the
child
of
the
cord
who
denies
or
conceals
his
guilt
make
good
the
substance
of
thine
accusation
most
dreaded
answered
the
accuser
addressing
the
president
this
man
hath
entered
the
sacred
territory
which
is
called
the
red
land
a
stranger
under
a
disguised
name
and
profession
when
he
was
yet
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
alps
at
turin
in
lombardy
and
elsewhere
he
at
various
times
spoke
of
the
holy
tribunal
in
terms
of
hatred
and
contempt
and
declared
that
were
he
duke
of
burgundy
he
would
not
permit
it
to
extend
itself
from
westphalia
or
suabia
into
his
dominions
also
i
charge
him
that
nourishing
this
malevolent
intention
against
the
holy
tribunal
he
who
now
appears
before
the
bench
as
child
of
the
cord
has
intimated
his
intention
to
wait
upon
the
court
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
use
his
influence
with
him
which
he
boasts
will
prove
effectual
to
stir
him
up
to
prohibit
the
meetings
of
the
holy
vehme
in
his
dominions
and
to
inflict
on
their
officers
and
the
executors
of
their
mandates
the
punishment
due
to
robbers
and
assassins
this
is
a
heavy
charge
brother
said
the
president
of
the
assembly
when
the
accuser
ceased
speaking
how
do
you
purpose
to
make
it
good
according
to
the
tenor
of
those
secret
statutes
the
perusal
of
which
is
prohibited
to
all
but
the
initiated
answered
the
accuser
it
is
well
said
the
president
but
i
ask
thee
once
more
what
are
those
means
of
proof
you
speak
to
holy
and
to
initiated
ears
i
will
prove
my
charge
said
the
accuser
by
the
confession
of
the
party
himself
and
by
my
own
oath
upon
the
holy
emblems
of
the
secret
judgment
that
is
the
steel
and
the
cord
it
is
a
legitimate
offer
of
proof
said
a
member
of
the
aristocratic
bench
of
the
assembly
and
it
much
concerns
the
safety
of
the
system
to
which
we
are
bound
by
such
deep
oaths
a
system
handed
down
to
us
from
the
most
christian
and
holy
roman
emperor
charlemagne
for
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
saracens
and
punishing
such
of
them
as
revolted
again
to
their
pagan
practices
that
such
criminals
should
be
looked
to
this
duke
charles
of
burgundy
hath
already
crowded
his
army
with
foreigners
whom
he
can
easily
employ
against
this
sacred
court
more
especially
with
english
a
fierce
insular
people
wedded
to
their
own
usages
and
hating
those
of
every
other
nation
it
is
not
unknown
to
us
that
the
duke
hath
already
encouraged
opposition
to
the
officials
of
the
tribunal
in
more
than
one
part
of
his
german
dominions
and
that
in
consequence
instead
of
submitting
to
their
doom
with
reverent
resignation
children
of
the
cord
have
been
found
bold
enough
to
resist
the
executioners
of
the
vehme
striking
wounding
and
even
slaying
those
who
have
received
commission
to
put
them
to
death
this
contumacy
must
be
put
an
end
to
and
if
the
accused
shall
be
proved
to
be
one
of
those
by
whom
such
doctrines
are
harboured
and
inculcated
i
say
let
the
steel
and
cord
do
their
work
on
him
a
general
murmur
seemed
to
approve
what
the
speaker
had
said
for
all
were
conscious
that
the
power
of
the
tribunal
depended
much
more
on
the
opinion
of
its
being
deeply
and
firmly
rooted
in
the
general
system
than
upon
any
regard
or
esteem
for
an
institution
of
which
all
felt
the
severity
it
followed
that
those
of
the
members
who
enjoyed
consequence
by
means
of
their
station
in
the
ranks
of
the
vehme
saw
the
necessity
of
supporting
its
terrors
by
occasional
examples
of
severe
punishment
and
none
could
be
more
readily
sacrificed
than
an
unknown
and
wandering
foreigner
all
this
rushed
upon
philipson
mind
but
did
not
prevent
his
making
a
steady
reply
to
the
accusation
gentlemen
he
said
good
citizens
burgesses
or
by
whatever
other
name
you
please
to
be
addressed
know
that
in
my
former
days
i
have
stood
in
as
great
peril
as
now
and
have
never
turned
my
heel
to
save
my
life
cords
and
daggers
are
not
calculated
to
strike
terror
into
those
who
have
seen
swords
and
lances
my
answer
to
the
accusation
is
that
i
am
an
englishman
one
of
a
nation
accustomed
to
yield
and
to
receive
and
equal
justice
dealt
forth
in
the
broad
light
of
day
i
am
however
a
traveller
who
knows
that
he
has
no
right
to
oppose
the
rules
and
laws
of
other
nations
because
they
do
not
resemble
those
of
his
own
but
this
caution
can
only
be
called
for
in
lands
where
the
system
about
which
we
converse
is
in
full
force
and
operation
if
we
speak
of
the
institutions
of
germany
being
at
the
time
in
france
or
spain
we
may
without
offence
to
the
country
in
which
they
are
current
dispute
concerning
them
as
students
debate
upon
a
logical
thesis
in
a
university
the
accuser
objects
to
me
that
at
turin
or
elsewhere
in
the
north
of
italy
i
spoke
with
censure
of
the
institution
under
which
i
am
now
judged
i
will
not
deny
that
i
remember
something
of
the
kind
but
it
was
in
consequence
of
the
question
being
in
a
manner
forced
upon
me
by
two
guests
with
whom
i
chanced
to
find
myself
at
table
i
was
much
and
earnestly
solicited
for
an
opinion
ere
i
gave
one
and
was
that
opinion
said
the
presiding
judge
favourable
or
otherwise
to
the
holy
and
secret
let
truth
rule
your
tongue
remember
life
is
short
judgment
is
eternal
i
would
not
save
my
life
at
the
expense
of
a
falsehood
my
opinion
was
unfavourable
and
i
expressed
myself
thus
no
laws
or
judicial
proceedings
can
be
just
or
commendable
which
exist
and
operate
by
means
of
a
secret
combination
i
said
that
justice
could
only
live
and
exist
in
the
open
air
and
that
when
she
ceased
to
be
public
she
degenerated
into
revenge
and
hatred
i
said
that
a
system
of
which
your
own
jurists
have
said
frater
a
fratre
non
hospes
a
hospite
was
too
much
adverse
to
the
laws
of
nature
to
be
connected
with
or
regulated
by
those
of
religion
these
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
there
burst
a
murmur
from
the
judges
highly
unfavourable
to
the
prisoner
he
blasphemes
the
holy
vehme
let
his
mouth
be
closed
for
ever
hear
me
said
the
englishman
as
you
will
one
day
wish
to
be
yourselves
heard
i
say
such
were
my
sentiments
and
so
i
expressed
them
i
say
also
i
had
a
right
to
express
these
opinions
whether
sound
or
erroneous
in
a
neutral
country
where
this
tribunal
neither
did
nor
could
claim
any
jurisdiction
my
sentiments
are
still
the
same
i
would
avow
them
if
that
sword
were
at
my
bosom
or
that
cord
around
my
throat
but
i
deny
that
i
have
ever
spoken
against
the
institutions
of
your
vehme
in
a
country
where
it
had
its
course
as
a
national
mode
of
justice
far
more
strongly
if
possible
do
i
denounce
the
absurdity
of
the
falsehood
which
represents
me
a
wandering
foreigner
as
commissioned
to
traffic
with
the
duke
of
burgundy
about
such
high
matters
or
to
form
a
conspiracy
for
the
destruction
of
a
system
to
which
so
many
seem
warmly
attached
i
never
said
such
a
thing
and
i
never
thought
it
accuser
said
the
presiding
judge
thou
hast
heard
the
accused
what
is
thy
reply
the
first
part
of
the
charge
said
the
accuser
he
hath
confessed
in
this
high
presence
namely
that
his
foul
tongue
hath
basely
slandered
our
holy
mysteries
for
which
he
deserves
that
it
should
be
torn
out
of
his
throat
i
myself
on
my
oath
of
office
will
aver
as
use
and
law
is
that
the
rest
of
the
accusation
namely
that
which
taxes
him
as
having
entered
into
machinations
for
the
destruction
of
the
vehmique
institutions
is
as
true
as
those
which
he
has
found
himself
unable
to
deny
in
justice
said
the
englishman
the
accusation
if
not
made
good
by
satisfactory
proof
ought
to
be
left
to
the
oath
of
the
party
accused
instead
of
permitting
the
accuser
to
establish
by
his
own
deposition
the
defects
in
his
own
charge
stranger
replied
the
presiding
judge
we
permit
to
thy
ignorance
a
longer
and
more
full
defence
than
consists
with
our
usual
forms
know
that
the
right
of
sitting
among
these
venerable
judges
confers
on
the
person
of
him
who
enjoys
it
a
sacredness
of
character
which
ordinary
men
can
not
attain
to
the
oath
of
one
of
the
initiated
must
counterbalance
the
most
solemn
asseveration
of
every
one
that
is
not
acquainted
with
our
holy
secrets
in
the
vehmique
court
all
must
be
vehmique
the
averment
of
the
emperor
he
being
uninitiated
would
not
have
so
much
weight
in
our
counsels
as
that
of
one
of
the
meanest
of
these
officials
the
affirmation
of
the
accuser
can
only
be
rebutted
by
the
oath
of
a
member
of
the
same
tribunal
being
of
superior
rank
then
god
be
gracious
to
me
for
i
have
no
trust
save
in
heaven
said
the
englishman
in
solemn
accents
yet
i
will
not
fall
without
an
effort
i
call
upon
thee
thyself
dark
spirit
who
presidest
in
this
most
deadly
assembly
i
call
upon
thyself
to
declare
on
thy
faith
and
honour
whether
thou
holdest
me
guilty
of
what
is
thus
boldly
averred
by
this
false
calumniator
i
call
upon
thee
by
thy
sacred
character
by
the
name
of
hold
replied
the
presiding
judge
the
name
by
which
we
are
known
in
open
air
must
not
be
pronounced
in
this
subterranean
he
then
proceeded
to
address
the
prisoner
and
the
i
being
called
on
in
evidence
declare
that
the
charge
against
thee
is
so
far
true
as
it
is
acknowledged
by
thyself
namely
that
thou
hast
in
other
lands
than
the
red
soil
spoken
lightly
of
this
holy
institution
of
justice
but
i
believe
in
my
soul
and
will
bear
witness
on
my
honour
that
the
rest
of
the
accusation
is
incredible
and
false
and
this
i
swear
holding
my
hand
on
the
dagger
and
the
what
is
your
judgment
my
brethren
upon
the
case
which
you
have
investigated
a
member
of
the
and
highest
class
amongst
the
judges
muffled
like
the
rest
but
the
tone
of
whose
voice
and
the
stoop
of
whose
person
announced
him
to
be
more
advanced
in
years
than
the
other
two
who
had
before
spoken
arose
with
difficulty
and
said
with
a
trembling
voice
the
child
of
the
cord
who
is
before
us
has
been
convicted
of
folly
and
rashness
in
slandering
our
holy
institution
but
he
spoke
his
folly
to
ears
which
had
never
heard
our
sacred
laws
he
has
therefore
been
acquitted
by
irrefragable
testimony
of
combining
for
the
impotent
purpose
of
undermining
our
power
or
stirring
up
princes
against
our
holy
association
for
which
death
were
too
light
a
punishment
he
hath
been
foolish
then
but
not
criminal
and
as
the
holy
laws
of
the
vehme
bear
no
penalty
save
that
of
death
i
propose
for
judgment
that
the
child
of
the
cord
be
restored
without
injury
to
society
and
to
the
upper
world
having
been
first
duly
admonished
of
his
errors
child
of
the
cord
said
the
presiding
judge
thou
hast
heard
thy
sentence
of
acquittal
but
as
thou
desirest
to
sleep
in
an
unbloody
grave
let
me
warn
thee
that
the
secrets
of
this
night
shall
remain
with
thee
as
a
secret
not
to
be
communicated
to
father
nor
mother
to
spouse
son
or
daughter
neither
to
be
spoken
aloud
nor
whispered
to
be
told
in

or
written
in
characters
to
be
carved
or
to
be
painted
or
to
be
otherwise
communicated
either
directly
or
by
parable
and
emblem
obey
this
behest
and
thy
life
is
in
surety
let
thy
heart
then
rejoice
within
thee
but
let
it
rejoice
with
trembling
never
more
let
thy
vanity
persuade
thee
that
thou
art
secure
from
the
servants
and
judges
of
the
holy
vehme
though
a
thousand
leagues
lie
between
thee
and
the
red
land
and
thou
speakest
in
that
where
our
power
is
not
known
though
thou
shouldst
be
sheltered
by
thy
native
island
and
defended
by
thy
kindred
ocean
yet
even
there
i
warn
thee
to
cross
thyself
when
thou
dost
so
much
as
think
of
the
holy
and
invisible
tribunal
and
to
retain
thy
thoughts
within
thine
own
bosom
for
the
avenger
may
be
beside
thee
and
thou
mayst
die
in
thy
folly
go
hence
be
wise
and
let
the
fear
of
the
holy
vehme
never
pass
from
before
thine
eyes
at
the
concluding
words
all
the
lights
were
at
once
extinguished
with
a
hissing
noise
philipson
felt
once
more
the
grasp
of
the
hands
of
the
officials
to
which
he
resigned
himself
as
the
safest
course
he
was
gently
prostrated
on
his
and
transported
back
to
the
place
from
which
he
had
been
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
altar
the
cordage
was
again
applied
to
the
platform
and
philipson
was
sensible
that
his
couch
rose
with
him
for
a
few
moments
until
a
slight
shock
apprised
him
that
he
was
again
brought
to
a
level
with
the
floor
of
the
chamber
in
which
he
had
been
lodged
on
the
preceding
night
or
rather
morning
he
pondered
over
the
events
that
had
passed
in
which
he
was
sensible
that
he
owed
heaven
thanks
for
a
great
deliverance
fatigue
at
length
prevailed
over
anxiety
and
he
fell
into
a
deep
and
profound
sleep
from
which
he
was
only
awakened
by
returning
light
he
resolved
on
an
instant
departure
from
so
dangerous
a
spot
and
without
seeing
any
one
of
the
household
but
the
old
ostler
pursued
his
journey
to
strasburg
and
reached
that
city
without
further
accident

canto
when
arthur
philipson
left
his
father
to
go
on
board
the
bark
which
was
to
waft
him
across
the
rhine
he
took
but
few
precautions
for
his
own
subsistence
during
a
separation
of
which
he
calculated
the
duration
to
be
very
brief
some
necessary
change
of
raiment
and
a
very
few
pieces
of
gold
were
all
which
he
thought
it
needful
to
withdraw
from
the
general
stock
the
rest
of
the
baggage
and
money
he
left
with
the
which
he
concluded
his
father
might
need
in
order
to
sustain
his
character
as
an
english
trader
having
embarked
with
his
horse
and
his
slender
appointments
on
board
a
she
instantly
raised
her
temporary
mast
spread
a
sail
across
the
yard
and
supported
by
the
force
of
the
wind
against
the
downward
power
of
the
current
moved
across
the
river
obliquely
in
the
direction
of
which
as
we
have
said
lies
somewhat
lower
on
the
river
than
their
passage
was
so
favourable
that
they
reached
the
opposite
side
in
a
few
minutes
but
not
until
arthur
whose
eye
and
thoughts
were
on
the
left
bank
had
seen
his
father
depart
from
the
chapel
of
the
ferry
accompanied
by
two
horsemen
whom
he
readily
concluded
to
be
the
guide
bartholomew
and
some
chance
traveller
who
had
joined
him
but
the
second
of
whom
was
in
truth
the
black
priest
of
paul
as
has
been
already
mentioned
this
augmentation
of
his
father
company
was
he
could
not
but
think
likely
to
be
attended
with
an
increase
of
his
safety
since
it
was
not
probable
he
would
suffer
a
companion
to
be
forced
upon
him
and
one
of
his
own
choosing
might
be
a
protection
in
case
his
guide
should
prove
treacherous
at
any
rate
he
had
to
rejoice
that
he
had
seen
his
father
depart
in
safety
from
the
spot
where
they
had
reason
to
apprehend
some
danger
awaited
him
he
resolved
therefore
to
make
no
stay
at
but
to
pursue
his
way
as
fast
as
possible
towards
strasburg
and
rest
when
darkness
compelled
him
to
stop
in
one
of
the
or
villages
which
were
situated
on
the
german
side
of
the
rhine
at
strasburg
he
trusted
with
the
sanguine
spirit
of
youth
he
might
again
be
able
to
rejoin
his
father
and
if
he
could
not
altogether
subdue
his
anxiety
on
their
separation
he
fondly
nourished
the
hope
that
he
might
meet
him
in
safety
after
some
short
refreshment
and
repose
afforded
to
his
horse
he
lost
no
time
in
proceeding
on
his
journey
down
the
eastern
bank
of
the
broad
river
he
was
now
upon
the
most
interesting
side
of
the
rhine
walled
in
and
repelled
as
the
river
is
on
that
shore
by
the
most
romantic
cliffs
now
mantled
with
vegetation
of
the
richest
hue
tinged
with
all
the
variegated
colours
of
autumn
now
surmounted
by
fortresses
over
whose
gates
were
displayed
the
pennons
of
their
proud
owners
or
studded
with
hamlets
where
the
richness
of
the
soil
supplied
to
the
poor
labourer
the
food
of
which
the
oppressive
hand
of
his
superior
threatened
altogether
to
deprive
him
every
stream
which
here
contributes
its
waters
to
the
rhine
winds
through
its
own
tributary
dell
and
each
valley
possesses
a
varying
and
separate
character
some
rich
with
pastures
cornfields
and
vineyards
some
frowning
with
crags
and
precipices
and
other
romantic
beauties
the
principles
of
taste
were
not
then
explained
or
analysed
as
they
have
been
since
in
countries
where
leisure
has
been
found
for
this
investigation
but
the
feelings
arising
from
so
rich
a
landscape
as
is
displayed
by
the
valley
of
the
rhine
must
have
been
the
same
in
every
bosom
from
the
period
when
our
englishman
took
his
solitary
journey
through
it
in
doubt
and
danger
till
that
in
which
it
heard
the
indignant
childe
harold
bid
a
proud
farewell
to
his
native
country
in
the
vain
search
of
a
land
in
which
his
heart
might
throb
less
fiercely
arthur
enjoyed
this
scene
although
the
fading
daylight
began
to
remind
him
that
alone
as
he
was
and
travelling
with
a
very
valuable
charge
it
would
be
matter
of
prudence
to
look
out
for
some
place
of
rest
during
the
night
just
as
he
had
formed
the
resolution
of
inquiring
at
the
next
habitation
he
should
pass
which
way
he
should
follow
for
this
purpose
the
road
he
pursued
descended
into
a
beautiful
amphitheatre
filled
with
large
trees
which
protected
from
the
heats
of
summer
the
delicate
and
tender
herbage
of
the
pasture
a
large
brook
flowed
through
it
and
joined
the
rhine
at
a
short
mile
up
the
brook
its
waters
made
a
crescent
round
a
steep
craggy
eminence
crowned
with
flanking
walls
and
gothic
towers
and
turrets
enclosing
a
feudal
castle
of
the
first
order
a
part
of
the
savannah
that
has
been
mentioned
had
been
irregularly
cultivated
for
wheat
which
had
grown
a
plentiful
crop
it
was
gathered
in
but
the
patches
of
deep
yellow
stubble
contrasted
with
the
green
of
the
undisturbed
pasture
land
and
with
the
seared
and
foliage
of
the
broad
oaks
which
stretched
their
arms
athwart
the
level
space
there
a
lad
in
a
rustic
dress
was
employed
in
the
task
of
netting
a
brood
of
partridges
with
the
assistance
of
a
trained
spaniel
while
a
young
woman
who
had
the
air
rather
of
a
domestic
in
some
family
of
rank
than
that
of
an
ordinary
villager
sat
on
the
stump
of
a
decayed
tree
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
amusement
the
spaniel
whose
duty
it
was
to
drive
the
partridges
under
the
net
was
perceptibly
disturbed
at
the
approach
of
the
traveller
his
attention
was
divided
and
he
was
obviously
in
danger
of
marring
the
sport
by
barking
and
putting
up
the
covey
when
the
maiden
quitted
her
seat
and
advancing
towards
philipson
requested
him
for
courtesy
to
pass
at
a
greater
distance
and
not
interfere
with
their
amusement
the
traveller
willingly
complied
with
her
request
i
will
ride
fair
damsel
he
said
at
whatever
distance
you
please
and
allow
me
in
guerdon
to
ask
whether
there
is
convent
castle
or
good
man
house
where
a
stranger
who
is
belated
and
weary
might
receive
a
night
hospitality
the
girl
whose
face
he
had
not
yet
distinctly
seen
seemed
to
suppress
some
desire
to
laugh
as
she
replied
hath
not
yon
castle
think
you
pointing
to
the
distant
towers
some
corner
which
might
accommodate
a
stranger
in
such
extremity
space
enough
certainly
said
arthur
but
perhaps
little
inclination
to
grant
it
i
myself
said
the
girl
being
one
and
a
formidable
part
of
the
garrison
will
be
answerable
for
your
reception
but
as
you
parley
with
me
in
such
hostile
fashion
it
is
according
to
martial
order
that
i
should
put
down
my
visor
so
saying
she
concealed
her
face
under
one
of
those
which
at
that
period
women
often
wore
when
they
went
abroad
whether
for
protecting
their
complexion
or
screening
themselves
from
intrusive
observation
but
ere
she
could
accomplish
this
operation
arthur
had
detected
the
merry
countenance
of
annette
veilchen
a
girl
who
though
her
attendance
on
anne
of
geierstein
was
in
a
menial
capacity
was
held
in
high
estimation
at
geierstein
she
was
a
bold
wench
unaccustomed
to
the
distinctions
of
rank
which
were
little
regarded
in
the
simplicity
of
the
helvetian
hills
and
she
was
ready
to
laugh
jest
and
flirt
with
the
young
men
of
the
landamman
family
this
attracted
no
attention
the
mountain
manners
making
little
distinction
between
the
degrees
of
attendant
and
mistress
further
than
that
the
mistress
was
a
young
woman
who
required
help
and
the
maiden
one
who
was
in
a
situation
to
offer
and
afford
it
this
kind
of
familiarity
would
perhaps
have
been
dangerous
in
other
lands
but
the
simplicity
of
swiss
manners
and
the
turn
of
annette
disposition
which
was
resolute
and
sensible
though
rather
bold
and
free
when
compared
to
the
manners
of
more
civilised
countries
kept
all
intercourse
betwixt
her
and
the
young
men
of
the
family
in
the
strict
path
of
honour
and
innocence
arthur
himself
had
paid
considerable
attention
to
annette
being
naturally
from
his
feelings
towards
anne
of
geierstein
heartily
desirous
to
possess
the
good
graces
of
her
attendant
a
point
which
was
easily
gained
by
the
attentions
of
a
handsome
young
man
and
the
generosity
with
which
he
heaped
upon
her
small
presents
of
articles
of
dress
or
ornament
which
the
damsel
however
faithful
could
find
no
heart
to
refuse
the
assurance
that
he
was
in
anne
neighbourhood
and
that
he
was
likely
to
pass
the
night
under
the
same
roof
both
of
which
circumstances
were
intimated
by
the
girl
presence
and
language
sent
the
blood
in
a
hastier
current
through
arthur
veins
for
though
since
he
had
crossed
the
river
he
had
sometimes
nourished
hopes
of
again
seeing
her
who
had
made
so
strong
an
impression
on
his
imagination
yet
his
understanding
had
as
often
told
him
how
slight
was
the
chance
of
their
meeting
and
it
was
even
now
chilled
by
the
reflection
that
it
could
be
followed
only
by
the
pain
of
a
sudden
and
final
separation
he
yielded
himself
however
to
the
prospect
of
promised
pleasure
without
attempting
to
ascertain
what
was
to
be
its
duration
or
its
consequence
desirous
in
the
meantime
to
hear
as
much
of
anne
circumstances
as
annette
chose
to
tell
he
resolved
not
to
let
that
merry
maiden
perceive
that
she
was
known
by
him
until
she
chose
of
her
own
accord
to
lay
aside
her
mystery
while
these
thoughts
passed
rapidly
through
his
imagination
annette
bade
the
lad
drop
his
nets
and
directed
him
that
having
taken
two
of
the
partridges
from
the
covey
and
carried
them
into
the
kitchen
he
was
to
set
the
rest
at
liberty
i
must
provide
supper
said
she
to
the
traveller
since
i
am
bringing
home
unexpected
company
arthur
earnestly
expressed
his
hope
that
his
experiencing
the
hospitality
of
the
castle
would
occasion
no
trouble
to
the
inmates
and
received
satisfactory
assurances
upon
the
subject
of
his
scruples
i
would
not
willingly
be
the
cause
of
inconvenience
to
your
mistress
pursued
the
traveller
look
you
there
said
annette
veilchen
i
have
said
nothing
of
master
or
mistress
and
this
poor
forlorn
traveller
has
already
concluded
in
his
own
mind
that
he
is
to
be
harboured
in
a
bower
why
did
you
not
tell
me
said
arthur
somewhat
confused
at
his
blunder
that
you
were
the
person
of
second
importance
in
the
place
a
damsel
i
judged
could
only
be
an
officer
under
a
female
governor
i
do
not
see
the
justice
of
the
conclusion
replied
the
maiden
i
have
known
ladies
bear
offices
of
trust
in
lords
families
nay
and
over
the
lords
themselves
am
i
to
understand
fair
damsel
that
you
hold
so
predominant
a
situation
in
the
castle
which
we
are
now
approaching
and
of
which
i
pray
you
to
tell
me
the
name
the
name
of
the
castle
is
arnheim
said
annette
your
garrison
must
be
a
large
one
said
arthur
looking
at
the
extensive
building
if
you
are
able
to
man
such
a
labyrinth
of
walls
and
towers
in
that
point
said
annette
i
must
needs
own
we
are
very
deficient
at
present
we
rather
hide
in
the
castle
than
inhabit
it
and
yet
it
is
well
enough
defended
by
the
reports
which
frighten
every
other
person
who
might
disturb
its
seclusion
and
yet
you
yourselves
dare
to
reside
in
it
said
the
englishman
recollecting
the
tale
which
had
been
told
by
rudolph
donnerhugel
concerning
the
character
of
the
barons
of
arnheim
and
the
final
catastrophe
of
the
family
perhaps
replied
his
guide
we
are
too
intimate
with
the
cause
of
such
fears
to
feel
ourselves
strongly
oppressed
with
them
perhaps
we
have
means
of
encountering
the
supposed
terrors
proper
to
ourselves
perhaps
and
it
is
not
the
least
likely
conjecture
we
have
no
choice
of
a
better
place
of
refuge
such
seems
to
be
your
own
fate
at
present
sir
for
the
tops
of
the
distant
hills
are
gradually
losing
the
lights
of
the
evening
and
if
you
rest
not
in
arnheim
well
contented
or
not
you
are
likely
to
find
no
safe
lodging
for
many
a
mile
as
she
thus
spoke
she
separated
from
arthur
taking
with
the
fowler
who
attended
her
a
very
steep
but
short
footpath
which
ascended
straight
up
to
the
site
of
the
castle
at
the
same
time
motioning
to
the
young
englishman
to
follow
a
which
more
circuitous
led
to
the
same
point
and
though
less
direct
was
considerably
more
easy
he
soon
stood
before
the
south
front
of
arnheim
castle
which
was
a
much
larger
building
than
he
had
conceived
either
from
description
or
from
the
distant
view
it
had
been
erected
at
many
different
periods
and
a
considerable
part
of
the
edifice
was
less
in
the
strict
gothic
than
in
what
has
been
termed
the
saracenic
style
in
which
the
imagination
of
the
architect
is
more
florid
than
that
which
is
usually
indulged
in
the
north
rich
in
minarets
cupolas
and
similar
approximations
to
oriental
structures
this
singular
building
bore
a
general
appearance
of
desolation
and
desertion
but
rudolph
had
been
misinformed
when
he
declared
that
it
had
become
ruinous
on
the
contrary
it
had
been
maintained
with
considerable
care
and
when
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
emperor
although
no
garrison
was
maintained
within
its
precincts
care
was
taken
to
keep
the
building
in
repair
and
though
the
prejudices
of
the
country
people
prevented
any
one
from
passing
the
night
within
the
fearful
walls
yet
it
was
regularly
visited
from
time
to
time
by
a
person
having
commission
from
the
imperial
chancery
to
that
effect
the
occupation
of
the
domain
around
the
castle
was
a
valuable
compensation
for
this
official
person
labour
and
he
took
care
not
to
endanger
the
loss
of
it
by
neglecting
his
duty
of
late
this
officer
had
been
withdrawn
and
now
it
appeared
that
the
young
baroness
of
arnheim
had
found
refuge
in
the
deserted
towers
of
her
ancestors
the
swiss
damsel
did
not
leave
the
youthful
traveller
time
to
study
particularly
the
exterior
of
the
castle
or
to
construe
the
meaning
of
emblems
and
mottoes
seemingly
of
an
oriental
character
with
which
the
outside
was
inscribed
and
which
expressed
in
various
modes
more
or
less
directly
the
attachment
of
the
builders
of
this
extensive
pile
to
the
learning
of
the
eastern
sages
ere
he
had
time
to
take
more
than
a
general
survey
of
the
place
the
voice
of
the
swiss
maiden
called
him
to
an
angle
of
the
wall
in
which
there
was
a
projection
whence
a
long
plank
extended
over
a
dry
moat
and
was
connected
with
a
window
in
which
annette
was
standing
you
have
forgotten
your
swiss
lessons
already
said
she
observing
that
arthur
went
rather
timidly
about
crossing
the
temporary
and
precarious
drawbridge
the
reflection
that
anne
her
mistress
might
make
the
same
observation
recalled
the
young
traveller
to
the
necessary
degree
of
composure
he
passed
over
the
plank
with
the
same
with
which
he
had
learned
to
brave
the
far
more
terrific
bridge
beneath
the
ruinous
castle
of
geierstein
he
had
no
sooner
entered
the
window
than
annette
taking
off
her
mask
bade
him
welcome
to
germany
and
to
old
friends
with
new
names
anne
of
geierstein
she
said
is
no
more
but
you
will
presently
see
the
lady
baroness
of
arnheim
who
is
extremely
like
her
and
i
who
was
annette
veilchen
in
switzerland
the
servant
to
a
damsel
who
was
not
esteemed
much
greater
than
myself
am
now
the
young
and
make
everybody
of
less
quality
stand
back
if
in
such
circumstances
said
young
philipson
you
have
the
influence
due
to
your
consequence
let
me
beseech
of
you
to
tell
the
baroness
since
we
must
now
call
her
so
that
my
present
intrusion
on
her
is
occasioned
by
my
ignorance
away
away
said
the
girl
laughing
i
know
better
what
to
say
in
your
behalf
you
are
not
the
first
poor
man
and
pedlar
that
has
got
the
graces
of
a
great
lady
but
i
warrant
you
it
was
not
by
making
humble
apologies
and
talking
of
unintentional
intrusion
i
will
tell
her
of
love
which
all
the
rhine
can
not
quench
and
which
has
driven
you
hither
leaving
you
no
other
choice
than
to
come
or
to
perish
nay
but
annette
annette
fie
on
you
for
a
fool
make
a
shorter
name
of
it
cry
anne
anne
and
there
will
be
more
prospect
of
your
being
answered
so
saying
the
wild
girl
ran
out
of
the
room
delighted
as
a
mountaineer
of
her
description
was
likely
to
be
with
the
thought
of
having
done
as
she
would
desire
to
be
done
by
in
her
benevolent
exertions
to
bring
two
lovers
together
when
on
the
eve
of
inevitable
separation
in
this
disposition
annette
sped
up
a
narrow
turnpike
stair
to
a
closet
or
where
her
young
mistress
was
seated
and
exclaimed
with
open
mouth
anne
of
gei
i
mean
my
lady
baroness
they
are
come
they
are
come
the
philipsons
said
anne
almost
breathless
as
she
asked
the
question
yes
no
answered
the
girl
that
is
yes
for
the
best
of
them
is
come
and
that
is
arthur
what
meanest
thou
girl
is
not
seignor
philipson
the
father
along
with
his
son
not
he
indeed
answered
veilchen
nor
did
i
ever
think
of
asking
about
him
he
was
no
friend
of
mine
nor
of
any
one
else
save
the
old
landamman
and
well
met
they
were
for
a
couple
of
wiseacres
with
eternal
proverbs
in
their
mouths
and
care
upon
their
brows
unkind
inconsiderate
girl
what
hast
thou
done
said
anne
of
geierstein
did
i
not
warn
and
charge
thee
to
bring
them
both
hither
and
you
have
brought
the
young
man
alone
to
a
place
where
we
are
nearly
in
solitude
what
will
he
what
can
he
think
of
me
why
what
should
i
have
done
said
annette
remaining
firm
in
her
argument
he
was
alone
and
should
i
have
sent
him
down
to
the
to
be
murdered
by
the
rhinegrave
lanzknechts
all
is
fish
i
trow
that
comes
to
their
net
and
how
is
he
to
get
through
this
country
so
beset
with
wandering
soldiers
robber
barons
i
beg
your
pardon
and
roguish
italians
flocking
to
the
duke
of
standard
not
to
mention
the
greatest
terror
of
all
that
is
never
in
one
shape
or
other
absent
from
one
eye
or
thought
hush
hush
girl
add
not
utter
madness
to
the
excess
of
folly
but
let
us
think
what
is
to
be
done
for
our
sake
for
his
own
this
unfortunate
young
man
must
leave
this
castle
instantly
you
must
take
the
message
yourself
then
anne
i
beg
pardon
most
noble
baroness
it
may
be
very
fit
for
a
lady
of
high
birth
to
send
such
a
message
which
indeed
i
have
heard
the
tell
in
their
romances
but
i
am
sure
it
is
not
a
meet
one
for
me
or
any
swiss
girl
to
carry
no
more
foolery
but
remember
if
you
were
born
baroness
of
arnheim
you
have
been
bred
and
brought
up
in
the
bosom
of
the
swiss
hills
and
should
conduct
yourself
like
an
honest
and
damsel
and
in
what
does
your
wisdom
reprehend
my
folly
good
mademoiselle
annette
replied
the
baroness
ay
marry
now
our
noble
blood
stirs
in
our
veins
but
remember
gentle
my
lady
that
it
was
a
bargain
between
us
when
i
left
yonder
noble
mountains
and
the
free
air
that
blows
over
them
to
coop
myself
up
in
this
land
of
prisons
and
slaves
that
i
should
speak
my
mind
to
you
as
freely
as
i
did
when
our
heads
lay
on
the
same
pillow
speak
then
said
anne
studiously
averting
her
face
as
she
prepared
to
listen
but
beware
that
you
say
nothing
which
it
is
unfit
for
me
to
hear
i
will
speak
nature
and
and
if
your
noble
ears
are
not
made
fit
to
hear
and
understand
these
the
fault
lies
in
them
and
not
in
my
tongue
look
you
you
have
saved
this
youth
from
two
great
dangers
one
at
the
at
geierstein
the
other
this
very
day
when
his
life
was
beset
a
handsome
young
man
he
is
well
spoken
and
well
qualified
to
gain
deservedly
a
lady
favour
before
you
saw
him
the
swiss
youth
were
at
least
not
odious
to
you
you
danced
with
them
you
jested
with
them
you
were
the
general
object
of
their
admiration
and
as
you
well
know
you
might
have
had
your
choice
through
the
canton
why
i
think
it
possible
a
little
urgency
might
have
brought
you
to
think
of
rudolph
donnerhugel
as
your
mate
never
wench
never
exclaimed
anne
be
not
so
very
positive
my
lady
had
he
recommended
himself
to
the
uncle
in
the
first
place
i
think
in
my
poor
sentiment
he
might
at
some
lucky
moment
have
carried
the
niece
but
since
we
have
known
this
young
englishman
it
has
been
little
less
than
contemning
despising
and
something
like
hating
all
the
men
whom
you
could
endure
well
enough
before
well
well
said
anne
i
will
detest
and
hate
thee
more
than
any
of
them
unless
you
bring
your
matters
to
an
end
softly
noble
lady
fair
and
easy
go
far
all
this
argues
you
love
the
young
man
and
let
those
say
that
you
are
wrong
who
think
there
is
anything
wonderful
in
the
matter
there
is
much
to
justify
you
and
nothing
that
i
know
against
it
what
foolish
girl
remember
my
birth
forbids
me
to
love
a
mean
man
my
condition
to
love
a
poor
man
my
father
commands
to
love
one
whose
addresses
are
without
his
consent
above
all
my
maidenly
pride
forbids
me
fixing
my
affections
on
one
who
cares
not
for
me
nay
perhaps
is
prejudiced
against
me
by
appearances
here
is
a
fine
homily
said
annette
but
i
can
clear
every
point
of
it
as
easily
as
father
francis
does
his
text
in
a
holiday
sermon
your
birth
is
a
silly
dream
which
you
have
only
learned
to
value
within
these
two
or
three
days
when
having
come
to
german
soil
some
of
the
old
german
weed
usually
called
family
pride
has
begun
to
germinate
in
your
heart
think
of
such
folly
as
you
thought
when
you
lived
at
geierstein
that
is
during
all
the
rational
part
of
your
life
and
this
great
terrible
prejudice
will
sink
into
nothing
by
condition
i
conceive
you
mean
estate
but
philipson
father
who
is
the
most
of
men
will
surely
give
his
son
as
many
zechins
as
will
stock
a
mountain
farm
you
have
firewood
for
the
cutting
and
land
for
the
occupying
since
you
are
surely
entitled
to
part
of
geierstein
and
gladly
will
your
uncle
put
you
in
possession
of
it
you
can
manage
the
dairy
arthur
can
shoot
hunt
fish
plough
harrow
and
reap
anne
of
geierstein
shook
her
head
as
if
she
greatly
doubted
her
lover
skill
in
the
last
of
the
accomplishments
enumerated
well
well
he
can
learn
then
said
annette
veilchen
and
you
will
only
live
the
harder
the
first
year
or
so
besides
sigismund
biederman
will
aid
him
willingly
and
he
is
a
very
horse
at
labour
and
i
know
another
besides
who
is
a
friend
of
thine
own
i
warrant
quoth
the
young
baroness
marry
it
is
my
poor
friend
louis
sprenger
and
i
never
be
so
as
to
deny
my
bachelor
well
well
but
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
all
this
said
the
baroness
impatiently
the
end
of
it
in
my
opinion
said
annette
is
very
simple
here
are
priests
and
within
a
mile
go
down
to
the
parlour
speak
your
mind
to
your
lover
or
hear
him
speak
his
mind
to
you
join
hands
go
quietly
back
to
geierstein
in
the
character
of
man
and
wife
and
get
everything
ready
to
receive
your
uncle
on
his
return
this
is
the
way
that
a
plain
swiss
wench
would
cut
off
the
romance
of
a
german
baroness
and
break
the
heart
of
her
father
said
the
young
lady
with
a
sigh
it
is
more
tough
than
you
are
aware
of
replied
annette
he
hath
not
lived
without
you
so
long
but
that
he
will
be
able
to
spare
you
for
the
rest
of
his
life
a
great
deal
more
easily
than
you
with
all
your
ideas
of
quality
will
be
able
to
endure
his
schemes
of
wealth
and
ambition
which
will
aim
at
making
you
the
wife
of
some
illustrious
count
like
de
hagenbach
whom
we
saw
not
long
since
make
such
an
edifying
end
to
the
great
example
of
all
upon
the
rhine
thy
plan
is
naught
wench
a
childish
vision
of
a
girl
who
never
knew
more
of
life
than
she
has
heard
told
over
her
remember
that
my
uncle
entertains
the
highest
ideas
of
family
discipline
and
that
to
act
contrary
to
my
father
will
would
destroy
us
in
his
good
opinion
why
else
am
i
here
wherefore
has
he
resigned
his
guardianship
and
why
am
i
obliged
to
change
the
habits
that
are
dear
to
me
and
assume
the
manners
of
a
people
that
are
strange
and
therefore
unpleasing
to
me
your
uncle
said
annette
firmly
is
landamman
of
the
canton
of
unterwalden
respects
its
freedom
and
is
the
sworn
protector
of
its
laws
of
which
when
you
a
denizen
of
the
confederacy
claim
the
protection
he
can
not
refuse
it
to
you
even
then
said
the
young
baroness
i
should
forfeit
his
good
opinion
his
more
than
paternal
affection
but
it
is
needless
to
dwell
upon
this
know
that
although
i
could
have
loved
the
young
man
whom
i
will
not
deny
to
be
as
amiable
as
your
partiality
paints
him
know
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
that
he
has
never
spoken
a
word
to
me
on
such
a
subject
as
you
without
knowing
either
his
sentiments
or
mine
would
intrude
on
my
consideration
is
it
possible
answered
annette
i
thought
i
believed
though
i
have
never
pressed
on
your
confidence
that
you
must
attached
as
you
were
to
each
other
have
spoken
together
like
true
maid
and
true
bachelor
before
now
i
have
done
wrong
when
i
thought
to
do
for
the
is
it
possible
such
things
have
been
heard
of
even
in
our
canton
is
it
possible
he
can
have
harboured
so
unutterably
base
purposes
as
that
martin
of
brisach
who
made
love
to
adela
of
the
sundgau
enticed
her
to
folly
the
thing
though
almost
incredible
is
true
fled
fled
from
the
country
and
boasted
of
his
villany
till
her
cousin
raymund
silenced
for
ever
his
infamous
triumph
by
beating
his
brains
out
with
his
club
even
in
the
very
street
of
the
native
town
by
the
holy
mother
of
einsiedlen
could
i
suspect
this
englishman
of
meditating
such
treason
i
would
saw
the
plank
across
the
moat
till
a
fly
weight
would
break
it
and
it
should
be
at
six
fathom
deep
that
he
should
abye
the
perfidy
which
dared
to
meditate
dishonour
against
an
adopted
daughter
of
switzerland
as
annette
veilchen
spoke
all
the
fire
of
her
mountain
courage
flashed
from
her
eyes
and
she
listened
reluctantly
while
anne
of
geierstein
endeavoured
to
obliterate
the
dangerous
impression
which
her
former
words
had
impressed
on
her
simple
but
faithful
attendant
on
my
word
she
said
on
my
soul
you
do
arthur
philipson
injustice
foul
injustice
in
intimating
such
a
suspicion
his
conduct
towards
me
has
ever
been
upright
and
honourable
a
friend
to
a
friend
a
brother
to
a
sister
could
not
in
all
he
has
done
and
said
have
been
more
respectful
more
anxiously
affectionate
more
undeviatingly
candid
in
our
frequent
interviews
and
intercourse
he
has
indeed
seemed
very
kind
very
attached
but
had
i
been
disposed
at
times
i
may
have
been
too
much
so
to
listen
to
him
with
endurance
the
young
lady
here
put
her
hand
on
her
forehead
but
the
tears
streamed
through
her
slender
fingers
he
has
never
spoken
of
any
love
any
preference
if
he
indeed
entertains
any
some
obstacle
insurmountable
on
his
part
has
interfered
to
prevent
him
obstacle
replied
the
swiss
damsel
ay
doubtless
some
childish
bashfulness
some
foolish
idea
about
your
birth
being
so
high
above
his
own
some
dream
of
modesty
pushed
to
extremity
which
considers
as
impenetrable
the
ice
of
a
spring
frost
this
delusion
may
be
broken
by
a
moment
encouragement
and
i
will
take
the
task
on
myself
to
spare
your
blushes
my
dearest
anne
no
no
for
heaven
sake
no
veilchen
answered
the
baroness
to
whom
annette
had
so
long
been
a
companion
and
confidant
rather
than
a
domestic
you
can
not
anticipate
the
nature
of
the
obstacles
which
may
prevent
his
thinking
on
what
you
are
so
desirous
to
promote
hear
me
my
early
education
and
the
instructions
of
my
kind
uncle
have
taught
me
to
know
something
more
of
foreigners
and
their
fashions
than
i
ever
could
have
learned
in
our
happy
retirement
of
geierstein
i
am
convinced
that
these
philipsons
are
of
rank
as
they
are
of
manners
and
bearing
far
superior
to
the
occupation
which
they
appear
to
hold
the
father
is
a
man
of
deep
observation
of
high
thought
and
pretension
and
lavish
of
gifts
far
beyond
what
consists
with
the
utmost
liberality
of
a
trader
that
is
true
said
annette
i
will
say
for
myself
that
the
silver
chain
he
gave
me
weighs
against
ten
silver
crowns
and
the
cross
which
arthur
added
to
it
the
day
after
the
long
ride
we
had
together
up
towards
mount
pilatus
is
worth
they
tell
me
as
much
more
there
is
not
the
like
of
it
in
the
cantons
well
what
then
they
are
rich
so
are
you
so
much
the
better
alas
annette
they
are
not
only
rich
but
noble
i
am
persuaded
of
this
for
i
have
observed
often
that
even
the
father
retreated
with
an
air
of
quiet
and
dignified
contempt
from
discussions
with
donnerhugel
and
others
who
in
our
plain
way
wished
to
fasten
a
dispute
upon
him
and
when
a
rude
observation
or
blunt
pleasantry
was
pointed
at
the
son
his
eye
flashed
his
cheek
coloured
and
it
was
only
a
glance
from
his
father
which
induced
him
to
repress
the
retort
of
no
friendly
character
which
rose
to
his
lips
you
have
been
a
close
observer
said
annette
all
this
may
be
true
but
i
noted
it
not
but
what
then
i
say
once
more
if
arthur
has
some
fine
noble
name
in
his
own
country
are
not
you
yourself
baroness
of
arnheim
and
i
will
frankly
allow
it
as
something
of
worth
if
it
smooths
the
way
to
a
match
where
i
think
you
must
look
for
happiness
i
hope
so
else
i
am
sure
it
should
have
no
encouragement
from
me
i
do
believe
so
my
faithful
veilchen
but
alas
how
can
you
in
the
state
of
natural
freedom
in
which
you
have
been
bred
know
or
even
dream
of
the
various
restraints
which
this
gilded
or
golden
chain
of
rank
and
nobility
hangs
upon
those
whom
it
fetters
and
encumbers
i
fear
as
much
as
it
decorates
in
every
country
the
distinction
of
rank
binds
men
to
certain
duties
it
may
carry
with
it
restrictions
which
may
prevent
alliances
in
foreign
countries
it
often
may
prevent
them
from
consulting
their
inclinations
when
they
wed
in
their
own
it
leads
to
alliances
in
which
the
heart
is
never
consulted
to
treaties
of
marriage
which
are
often
formed
when
the
parties
are
in
the
cradle
or
in
leading
strings
but
which
are
not
the
less
binding
on
them
in
honour
and
faith
such
may
exist
in
the
present
case
these
alliances
are
often
blended
and
mixed
up
with
state
policy
and
if
the
interest
of
england
or
what
he
deems
such
should
have
occasioned
the
elder
philipson
to
form
such
an
engagement
arthur
would
break
his
own
heart
the
heart
of
any
one
else
rather
than
make
false
his
word
the
more
shame
to
them
that
formed
such
an
engagement
said
annette
well
they
talk
of
england
being
a
free
country
but
if
they
can
bar
young
men
and
women
of
the
natural
privilege
to
call
their
hands
and
hearts
their
own
i
would
as
soon
be
a
german
well
lady
you
are
wise
and
i
am
ignorant
but
what
is
to
be
done
i
have
brought
this
young
man
here
expecting
god
knows
a
happier
issue
to
your
meeting
but
it
is
clear
you
can
not
marry
him
without
his
asking
you
now
although
i
confess
that
if
i
could
think
him
willing
to
forfeit
the
hand
of
the
fairest
maid
of
the
cantons
either
from
want
of
manly
courage
to
ask
it
or
from
regard
to
some
ridiculous
engagement
formed
betwixt
his
father
and
some
other
nobleman
of
their
island
of
noblemen
i
would
not
in
either
case
grudge
him
a
ducking
in
the
moat
yet
it
is
another
question
whether
we
should
send
him
down
to
be
murdered
among
those
of
the
rhinegrave
and
unless
we
do
so
i
know
not
how
to
get
rid
of
him
then
let
the
boy
william
give
attendance
on
him
here
and
do
you
see
to
his
accommodation
it
is
best
we
do
not
meet
i
will
said
annette
yet
what
am
i
to
say
for
you
unhappily
i
let
him
know
that
you
were
here
alas
imprudent
girl
yet
why
should
i
blame
thee
said
anne
of
geierstein
when
the
imprudence
has
been
so
great
on
my
own
side
it
is
myself
who
suffering
my
imagination
to
rest
too
long
upon
this
young
man
and
his
merits
have
led
me
into
this
entanglement
but
i
will
show
thee
that
i
can
overcome
this
folly
and
i
will
not
seek
in
my
own
error
a
cause
for
evading
the
duties
of
hospitality
go
veilchen
get
some
refreshment
ready
thou
shalt
sup
with
us
and
thou
must
not
leave
us
thou
shalt
see
me
behave
as
becomes
both
a
german
lady
and
a
swiss
maiden
get
me
first
a
candle
however
my
girl
for
i
must
wash
these
my
eyes
and
arrange
my
dress
to
annette
this
whole
explanation
had
been
one
scene
of
astonishment
for
in
the
simple
ideas
of
love
and
courtship
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
amid
the
swiss
mountains
she
had
expected
that
the
two
lovers
would
have
taken
the
first
opportunity
of
the
absence
of
their
natural
guardians
and
have
united
themselves
for
ever
and
she
had
even
arranged
a
little
secondary
plot
in
which
she
herself
and
martin
sprenger
her
faithful
bachelor
were
to
reside
with
the
young
couple
as
friends
and
dependants
silenced
therefore
but
not
satisfied
by
the
objections
of
her
young
mistress
the
zealous
annette
retreated
murmuring
to
herself
that
little
hint
about
her
dress
is
the
only
natural
and
sensible
word
she
has
said
in
my
hearing
please
god
i
will
return
and
help
her
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
that
dressing
my
mistress
is
the
only
part
of
a
life
that
i
have
the
least
fancy
for
it
seems
so
natural
for
one
pretty
maiden
to
set
off
another
in
faith
we
are
but
learning
to
dress
ourselves
at
another
time
and
with
this
sage
remark
annette
veilchen
tripped
down
stairs
chapter
iv
tell
me
not
of
it
i
could
abide
the
mummery
of
all
that
forced
civility
pray
seat
yourself
my
lord
with
cringing
hams
the
speech
is
spoken
and
with
bended
knee
heard
by
the
smiling
before
you
sir
it
must
be
on
the
earth
then
hang
it
all
the
pride
which
cloaks
itself
in
such
poor
fashion
is
scarcely
fit
to
swell
a
beggar
bosom
up
stairs
and
down
stairs
tripped
annette
veilchen
the
soul
of
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
only
habitable
corner
of
the
huge
castle
of
arnheim
she
was
equal
to
every
kind
of
service
and
therefore
popped
her
head
into
the
stable
to
be
sure
that
william
attended
properly
to
arthur
horse
looked
into
the
kitchen
to
see
that
the
old
cook
marthon
roasted
the
partridges
in
due
time
an
interference
for
which
she
received
little
thanks
rummaged
out
a
flask
or
two
of
rhine
wine
from
the
huge
dom
daniel
of
a
cellar
and
finally
just
peeped
into
the
parlour
to
see
how
arthur
was
looking
when
having
the
satisfaction
to
see
he
had
in
the
best
manner
he
could
sedulously
arranged
his
person
she
assured
him
that
he
should
shortly
see
her
mistress
who
was
rather
indisposed
yet
could
not
refrain
from
coming
down
to
see
so
valued
an
acquaintance
arthur
blushed
when
she
spoke
thus
and
seemed
so
handsome
in
the
eye
that
she
could
not
help
saying
to
herself
as
she
went
to
her
young
lady
room
well
if
true
love
can
not
manage
to
bring
that
couple
together
in
spite
of
all
the
obstacles
that
they
stand
boggling
at
i
will
never
believe
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
true
love
in
the
world
let
martin
sprenger
say
what
he
will
and
swear
to
it
on
the
gospels
when
she
reached
the
young
baroness
apartment
she
found
to
her
surprise
that
instead
of
having
put
on
what
finery
she
possessed
that
young
lady
choice
had
preferred
the
same
simple
kirtle
which
she
had
worn
during
the
first
day
that
arthur
had
dined
at
geierstein
annette
looked
at
first
puzzled
and
doubtful
then
suddenly
recognised
the
good
taste
which
had
dictated
the
attire
and
exclaimed
you
are
right
you
are
right
it
is
best
to
meet
him
as
a
swiss
maiden
anne
also
smiled
as
she
replied
but
at
the
same
time
in
the
walls
of
arnheim
i
must
appear
in
some
respect
as
the
daughter
of
my
here
girl
aid
me
to
put
this
gem
upon
the
riband
which
binds
my
hair
it
was
an
aigrette
or
plume
composed
of
two
feathers
of
a
vulture
fastened
together
by
an
opal
which
changed
to
the
changing
light
with
a
variability
which
enchanted
the
swiss
damsel
who
had
never
seen
anything
resembling
it
in
her
life
now
baroness
anne
said
she
if
that
pretty
thing
be
really
worn
as
a
sign
of
your
rank
it
is
the
only
thing
belonging
to
your
dignity
that
i
should
ever
think
of
coveting
for
it
doth
shimmer
and
change
colour
after
a
most
wonderful
fashion
even
something
like
one
own
cheek
when
one
is
fluttered
alas
annette
said
the
baroness
passing
her
hand
across
her
eyes
of
all
the
gauds
which
the
females
of
my
house
have
owned
this
perhaps
hath
been
the
most
fatal
to
its
possessors
and
why
then
wear
it
said
annette
why
wear
it
now
of
all
days
in
the
year
because
it
best
reminds
me
of
my
duty
to
my
father
and
family
and
now
girl
look
thou
sit
with
us
at
table
and
leave
not
the
apartment
and
see
thou
fly
not
to
and
fro
to
help
thyself
or
others
with
anything
on
the
board
but
remain
quiet
and
seated
till
william
helps
you
to
what
you
have
occasion
for
well
that
is
a
gentle
fashion
which
i
like
well
enough
said
annette
and
william
serves
us
so
debonairly
that
it
is
a
joy
to
see
him
yet
ever
and
anon
i
feel
as
i
were
not
annette
veilchen
herself
but
only
annette
veilchen
picture
since
i
can
neither
rise
sit
down
run
about
nor
stand
still
without
breaking
some
rule
of
courtly
breeding
it
is
not
so
i
dare
say
with
you
who
are
always
mannerly
less
courtly
than
thou
seemest
to
think
said
the
maiden
but
i
feel
the
restraint
more
on
the
greensward
and
under
free
air
than
when
i
undergo
it
closed
within
the
walls
of
an
apartment
ah
true
the
dancing
said
annette
that
was
something
to
be
sorry
for
indeed
but
most
am
i
sorry
annette
that
i
can
not
tell
whether
i
act
precisely
right
or
wrong
in
seeing
this
young
man
though
it
must
be
for
the
last
time
were
my
father
to
arrive
were
ital
schreckenwald
to
return
your
father
is
too
deeply
engaged
on
some
of
his
dark
and
mystic
errands
said
the
flippant
swiss
sailed
to
the
mountains
of
the
brockenberg
where
witches
hold
their
sabbath
or
gone
on
a
with
the
wild
huntsman
fie
annette
how
dare
you
talk
thus
of
my
father
why
i
know
little
of
him
personally
said
the
damsel
and
you
yourself
do
not
know
much
more
and
how
should
that
be
false
which
all
men
say
is
true
why
fool
what
do
they
say
why
that
the
count
is
a
wizard
that
your
grandmother
was
a
and
old
ital
schreckenwald
a
born
devil
incarnate
and
there
is
some
truth
in
that
whatever
comes
of
the
rest
where
is
he
gone
down
to
spend
the
night
in
the
village
to
see
the
men
quartered
and
keep
them
in
some
order
if
possible
for
the
soldiers
are
disappointed
of
pay
which
they
had
been
promised
and
when
this
happens
nothing
resembles
a
lanzknecht
except
a
chafed
bear
go
we
down
then
girl
it
is
perhaps
the
last
night
which
we
may
spend
for
years
with
a
certain
degree
of
freedom
i
will
not
pretend
to
describe
the
marked
embarrassment
with
which
arthur
philipson
and
anne
of
geierstein
met
neither
lifted
their
eyes
neither
spoke
intelligibly
as
they
greeted
each
other
and
the
maiden
herself
did
not
blush
more
deeply
than
her
modest
visitor
while
the
swiss
girl
whose
ideas
of
love
partook
of
the
freedom
of
a
more
arcadian
country
and
its
customs
looked
on
with
eyebrows
a
little
arched
much
in
wonder
and
a
little
in
contempt
at
a
couple
who
as
she
might
think
acted
with
such
unnatural
and
constrained
reserve
deep
was
the
reverence
and
the
blush
with
which
arthur
offered
his
hand
to
the
young
lady
and
her
acceptance
of
the
courtesy
had
the
same
character
of
extreme
bashfulness
agitation
and
embarrassment
in
short
though
little
or
nothing
intelligible
passed
between
this
very
handsome
and
interesting
couple
the
interview
itself
did
not
on
that
account
lose
any
interest
arthur
handed
the
maiden
as
was
the
duty
of
a
gallant
of
the
day
into
the
next
room
where
their
repast
was
prepared
and
annette
who
watched
with
singular
attention
everything
which
occurred
felt
with
astonishment
that
the
forms
and
ceremonies
of
the
higher
orders
of
society
had
such
an
influence
even
over
her
mind
as
the
rites
of
the
druids
over
that
of
the
roman
general
when
he
said
i
scorn
them
yet
they
awe
me
what
can
have
changed
them
said
annette
when
at
geierstein
they
looked
but
like
another
girl
and
bachelor
only
that
anne
is
so
very
handsome
but
now
they
move
in
time
and
manner
as
if
they
were
leading
a
stately
pavin
and
behave
to
each
other
with
as
much
formal
respect
as
if
he
were
landamman
of
the
unterwalden
and
she
the
first
lady
of
berne
is
all
very
fine
doubtless
but
it
is
not
the
way
that
martin
sprenger
makes
love
apparently
the
circumstances
in
which
each
of
the
young
people
was
placed
recalled
to
them
the
habits
of
lofty
and
somewhat
formal
courtesy
to
which
they
might
have
been
accustomed
in
former
days
and
while
the
baroness
felt
it
necessary
to
observe
the
strictest
decorum
in
order
to
qualify
the
reception
of
arthur
into
the
interior
of
her
retreat
he
on
the
other
hand
endeavoured
to
show
by
the
profoundness
of
his
respect
that
he
was
incapable
of
misusing
the
kindness
with
which
he
had
been
treated
they
placed
themselves
at
table
scrupulously
observing
the
distance
which
might
become
a
virtuous
gentleman
and
maid
the
youth
william
did
the
service
of
the
entertainment
with
deftness
and
courtesy
as
one
well
accustomed
to
such
duty
and
annette
placing
herself
between
them
and
endeavouring
as
closely
as
she
could
to
adhere
to
the
ceremonies
which
she
saw
them
observe
made
practice
of
the
civilities
which
were
expected
from
the
attendant
of
a
baroness
various
however
were
the
errors
which
she
committed
her
demeanour
in
general
was
that
of
a
greyhound
in
the
slips
ready
to
start
up
every
moment
and
she
was
only
withheld
by
the
recollection
that
she
was
to
ask
for
that
which
she
had
far
more
mind
to
help
herself
to
other
points
of
etiquette
were
transgressed
in
their
turn
after
the
repast
was
over
and
the
attendant
had
retired
the
waiting
damsel
often
mingled
too
unceremoniously
in
the
conversation
and
could
not
help
calling
her
mistress
by
her
christian
name
of
anne
and
in
defiance
of
all
decorum
addressed
her
as
well
as
philipson
with
the
pronoun
which
then
as
well
as
now
was
a
dreadful
solecism
in
german
politeness
her
blunders
were
so
far
fortunate
that
by
furnishing
the
young
lady
and
arthur
with
a
topic
foreign
to
the
peculiarities
of
their
own
situation
they
enabled
them
to
withdraw
their
attentions
from
its
embarrassments
and
to
exchange
smiles
at
poor
annette
expense
she
was
not
long
of
perceiving
this
and
half
nettled
half
availing
herself
of
the
apology
to
speak
her
mind
said
with
considerable
spirit
you
have
both
been
very
merry
forsooth
at
my
expense
and
all
because
i
wished
rather
to
rise
and
seek
what
i
wanted
than
wait
till
the
poor
fellow
who
was
kept
trotting
between
the
board
and
beauffet
found
leisure
to
bring
it
to
me
you
laugh
at
me
now
because
i
call
you
by
your
names
as
they
were
given
to
you
in
the
blessed
church
at
your
christening
and
because
i
say
to
you
and
addressing
my
juncker
and
my
yungfrau
as
i
would
do
if
i
were
on
my
knees
praying
to
heaven
but
for
all
your
fancies
i
can
tell
you
you
are
but
a
couple
of
children
who
do
not
know
your
own
minds
and
are
jesting
away
the
only
leisure
given
you
to
provide
for
your
own
happiness
nay
frown
not
my
sweet
mistress
baroness
i
have
looked
at
mount
pilatus
too
often
to
fear
a
gloomy
brow
peace
annette
said
her
mistress
or
quit
the
room
were
i
not
more
your
friend
than
i
am
my
own
said
the
headstrong
and
undaunted
annette
i
would
quit
the
room
and
the
castle
to
boot
and
leave
you
to
hold
your
house
here
with
your
amiable
seneschal
ital
schreckenwald
if
not
for
love
yet
for
shame
for
charity
be
silent
or
leave
the
room
nay
said
annette
my
bolt
is
shot
and
i
have
but
hinted
at
what
all
upon
geierstein
green
said
the
night
when
the
bow
of
buttisholz
was
bended
you
know
what
the
old
saw
says
peace
peace
for
heaven
sake
or
i
must
needs
fly
said
the
young
baroness
nay
then
said
annette
considerably
changing
her
tone
as
if
afraid
that
her
mistress
should
actually
retire
if
you
must
fly
necessity
must
have
its
course
i
know
no
one
who
can
follow
this
mistress
of
mine
seignor
arthur
would
require
for
her
attendant
not
a
homely
girl
of
flesh
and
blood
like
myself
but
a
with
substance
composed
of
gossamer
and
breath
supplied
by
the
spirit
of
ether
would
you
believe
it
it
is
seriously
held
by
many
that
she
partakes
of
the
race
of
spirits
of
the
elements
which
makes
her
so
much
more
bashful
than
maidens
of
this
world
anne
of
geierstein
seemed
rather
glad
to
lead
away
the
conversation
from
the
turn
which
her
wayward
maiden
had
given
to
it
and
to
turn
it
on
more
indifferent
subjects
though
these
were
still
personal
to
herself
seignor
arthur
she
said
thinks
perhaps
he
has
some
room
to
nourish
some
such
strange
suspicion
as
your
heedless
folly
expresses
and
some
fools
believe
both
in
germany
and
switzerland
confess
seignor
arthur
you
thought
strangely
of
me
when
i
passed
your
guard
upon
the
bridge
of
on
the
night
last
past
the
recollection
of
the
circumstances
which
had
so
greatly
surprised
him
at
the
time
so
startled
arthur
that
it
was
with
some
difficulty
he
commanded
himself
so
as
to
attempt
an
answer
at
all
and
what
he
did
say
on
the
occasion
was
broken
and
unconnected
i
did
hear
i
own
that
is
rudolph
donnerhugel
reported
but
that
i
believed
that
you
gentle
lady
were
other
than
a
christian
maiden
nay
if
rudolph
were
the
reporter
said
annette
you
would
hear
the
worst
of
my
lady
and
her
lineage
that
is
certain
he
is
one
of
those
prudent
personages
who
depreciate
and
find
fault
with
the
goods
he
has
thoughts
of
purchasing
in
order
to
deter
other
offerers
yes
he
told
you
a
fine
goblin
story
i
warrant
you
of
my
grandmother
and
truly
it
so
happened
that
the
circumstances
of
the
case
gave
i
dare
say
some
colour
in
your
eyes
to
not
so
annette
answered
arthur
whatever
might
be
said
of
your
lady
that
sounded
uncouth
and
strange
fell
to
the
ground
as
incredible
not
quite
so
much
so
i
fancy
interrupted
annette
without
heeding
sign
or
frown
i
strongly
suspect
i
should
have
had
much
more
trouble
in
dragging
you
hither
to
this
castle
had
you
known
you
were
approaching
the
haunt
of
the
nymph
of
the
fire
the
salamander
as
they
call
her
not
to
mention
the
shock
of
again
seeing
the
descendant
of
that
maiden
of
the
fiery
mantle
peace
once
more
annette
said
her
mistress
since
fate
has
occasioned
this
meeting
let
us
not
neglect
the
opportunity
to
disabuse
our
english
friend
of
the
absurd
report
he
has
listened
to
with
doubt
and
wonder
perhaps
but
not
with
absolute
incredulity
seignor
arthur
philipson
she
proceeded
it
is
true
my
grandfather
by
the
mother
side
baron
herman
of
arnheim
was
a
man
of
great
knowledge
in
abstruse
sciences
he
was
also
a
presiding
judge
of
a
tribunal
of
which
you
must
have
heard
called
the
holy
vehme
one
night
a
stranger
closely
pursued
by
the
agents
of
that
body
which
crossing
herself
it
is
not
safe
even
to
name
arrived
at
the
castle
and
craved
his
protection
and
the
rights
of
hospitality
my
grandfather
finding
the
advance
which
the
stranger
had
made
to
the
rank
of
adept
gave
him
his
protection
and
became
bail
to
deliver
him
to
answer
the
charge
against
him
for
a
year
and
a
day
which
delay
he
was
it
seems
entitled
to
require
on
his
behalf
they
studied
together
during
that
term
and
pushed
their
researches
into
the
mysteries
of
nature
as
far
in
all
probability
as
men
have
the
power
of
urging
them
when
the
fatal
day
drew
nigh
on
which
the
guest
must
part
from
his
host
he
asked
permission
to
bring
his
daughter
to
the
castle
that
they
might
exchange
a
last
farewell
she
was
introduced
with
much
secrecy
and
after
some
days
finding
that
her
father
fate
was
so
uncertain
the
baron
with
the
sage
consent
agreed
to
give
the
forlorn
maiden
refuge
in
his
castle
hoping
to
obtain
from
her
some
additional
information
concerning
the
languages
and
the
wisdom
of
the
east
dannischemend
her
father
left
this
castle
to
go
to
render
himself
up
to
the
at
fulda
the
result
is
unknown
perhaps
he
was
saved
by
baron
arnheim
testimony
perhaps
he
was
given
up
to
the
steel
and
the
cord
on
such
matters
who
dare
speak
the
fair
persian
became
the
wife
of
her
guardian
and
protector
amid
many
excellences
she
had
one
peculiarity
allied
to
imprudence
she
availed
herself
of
her
foreign
dress
and
manners
as
well
as
of
a
beauty
which
was
said
to
have
been
marvellous
and
an
agility
seldom
equalled
to
impose
upon
and
terrify
the
ignorant
german
ladies
who
hearing
her
speak
persian
and
arabic
were
already
disposed
to
consider
her
as
over
closely
connected
with
unlawful
arts
she
was
of
a
fanciful
and
imaginative
disposition
and
delighted
to
place
herself
in
such
colours
and
circumstances
as
might
confirm
their
most
ridiculous
suspicions
which
she
considered
only
as
matter
of
sport
there
was
no
end
to
the
stories
to
which
she
gave
rise
her
first
appearance
in
the
castle
was
said
to
be
highly
picturesque
and
to
have
inferred
something
of
the
marvellous
with
the
levity
of
a
child
she
had
some
childish
passions
and
while
she
encouraged
the
growth
and
circulation
of
the
most
extraordinary
legends
amongst
some
of
the
neighbourhood
she
entered
into
disputes
with
persons
of
her
own
quality
concerning
rank
and
precedence
on
which
the
ladies
of
westphalia
have
at
all
times
set
great
store
this
cost
her
her
life
for
on
the
morning
of
the
christening
of
my
poor
mother
the
baroness
of
arnheim
died
suddenly
even
while
a
splendid
company
was
assembled
in
the
castle
chapel
to
witness
the
ceremony
it
was
believed
that
she
died
of
poison
administered
by
the
baroness
steinfeldt
with
whom
she
was
engaged
in
a
bitter
quarrel
entered
into
chiefly
on
behalf
of
her
friend
and
companion
the
countess
waldstetten
and
the
opal
gem
and
the
sprinkling
with
water
said
arthur
philipson
ah
replied
the
young
baroness
i
see
you
desire
to
hear
the
real
truth
of
my
family
history
of
which
you
have
yet
learned
only
the
romantic
the
sprinkling
of
water
was
necessarily
had
recourse
to
on
my
ancestress
first
swoon
as
for
the
opal
i
have
heard
that
it
did
indeed
grow
pale
but
only
because
it
is
said
to
be
the
nature
of
that
noble
gem
on
the
approach
of
poison
some
part
of
the
quarrel
with
the
baroness
steinfeldt
was
about
the
right
of
the
persian
maiden
to
wear
this
stone
which
an
ancestor
of
my
family
won
in
battle
from
the
soldan
of
trebizond
all
these
things
were
confused
in
popular
tradition
and
the
real
facts
turned
into
a
fairy
tale
but
you
have
said
nothing
suggested
arthur
philipson
on
on
on
what
said
his
hostess
on
your
appearance
last
night
is
it
possible
said
she
that
a
man
of
sense
and
an
englishman
can
not
guess
at
the
explanation
which
i
have
to
give
though
not
perhaps
very
distinctly
my
father
you
are
aware
has
been
a
busy
man
in
a
disturbed
country
and
has
incurred
the
hatred
of
many
powerful
persons
he
is
therefore
obliged
to
move
in
secret
and
avoid
unnecessary
observation
he
was
besides
averse
to
meet
his
brother
the
landamman
i
was
therefore
told
on
our
entering
germany
that
i
was
to
expect
a
signal
where
and
when
to
join
him
the
token
was
to
be
a
small
crucifix
of
bronze
which
had
belonged
to
my
poor
mother
in
my
apartment
at
i
found
the
token
with
a
note
from
my
father
making
me
acquainted
with
a
secret
passage
proper
to
such
places
which
though
it
had
the
appearance
of
being
blocked
up
was
in
fact
very
slightly
barricaded
by
this
i
was
instructed
to
pass
to
the
gate
make
my
escape
into
the
woods
and
meet
my
father
at
a
place
appointed
there
a
wild
and
perilous
adventure
said
arthur
i
have
never
been
so
much
shocked
continued
the
maiden
as
at
receiving
this
summons
compelling
me
to
steal
away
from
my
kind
and
affectionate
uncle
and
go
i
knew
not
whither
yet
compliance
was
absolutely
necessary
the
place
of
meeting
was
plainly
pointed
out
a
midnight
walk
in
the
neighbourhood
of
protection
was
to
me
a
trifle
but
the
precaution
of
posting
sentinels
at
the
gate
might
have
interfered
with
my
purpose
had
i
not
mentioned
it
to
some
of
my
elder
cousins
the
biedermans
who
readily
agreed
to
let
me
pass
and
repass
unquestioned
but
you
know
my
cousins
honest
and
they
are
of
a
rude
way
of
thinking
and
as
incapable
of
feeling
a
generous
delicacy
as
some
other
persons
here
there
was
a
glance
towards
annette
veilchen
they
exacted
from
me
that
i
should
conceal
myself
and
my
purpose
from
sigismund
and
as
they
are
always
making
sport
with
the
simple
youth
they
insisted
that
i
should
pass
him
in
such
a
manner
as
might
induce
him
to
believe
that
i
was
a
spiritual
apparition
and
out
of
his
terrors
for
supernatural
beings
they
expected
to
have
much
amusement
i
was
obliged
to
secure
their
connivance
at
my
escape
on
their
own
terms
and
indeed
i
was
too
much
grieved
at
the
prospect
of
quitting
my
kind
uncle
to
think
much
of
anything
else
yet
my
surprise
was
considerable
when
contrary
to
expectation
i
found
you
on
the
bridge
as
sentinel
instead
of
my
cousin
sigismund
your
own
ideas
i
ask
not
for
they
were
those
of
a
fool
said
arthur
of
a
fool
had
i
been
aught
else
i
would
have
offered
my
escort
my
sword
i
could
not
have
accepted
your
protection
said
anne
calmly
my
mission
was
in
every
respect
a
secret
one
i
met
my
father
some
intercourse
had
taken
place
betwixt
him
and
rudolph
donnerhugel
which
induced
him
to
alter
his
purpose
of
carrying
me
away
with
him
last
night
i
joined
him
however
early
this
morning
while
annette
acted
for
a
time
my
part
amongst
the
swiss
pilgrims
my
father
desired
that
it
should
not
be
known
when
or
with
whom
i
left
my
uncle
and
his
escort
i
need
scarce
remind
you
that
i
saw
you
in
the
dungeon
you
were
the
preserver
of
my
life
said
the
youth
the
restorer
of
my
liberty
ask
me
not
the
reason
of
my
silence
i
was
then
acting
under
the
agency
of
others
not
under
mine
own
your
escape
was
effected
in
order
to
establish
a
communication
betwixt
the
swiss
without
the
fortress
and
the
soldiers
within
after
the
alarm
at
la
ferette
i
learned
from
sigismund
biederman
that
a
party
of
banditti
were
pursuing
your
father
and
you
with
a
view
to
pillage
and
robbery
my
father
had
furnished
me
with
the
means
of
changing
anne
of
geierstein
into
a
german
maiden
of
quality
i
set
out
instantly
and
glad
i
am
to
have
given
you
a
hint
which
might
free
you
from
danger
but
my
father
said
arthur
i
have
every
reason
to
hope
he
is
well
and
safe
answered
the
young
lady
more
than
i
were
eager
to
protect
both
you
and
him
poor
sigismund
amongst
the
and
now
my
friend
these
mysteries
explained
it
is
time
we
part
and
for
ever
part
and
for
ever
repeated
the
youth
in
a
voice
like
a
dying
echo
it
is
our
fate
said
the
maiden
i
appeal
to
you
if
it
is
not
your
duty
i
tell
you
it
is
mine
you
will
depart
with
early
dawn
to
strasburg
and
and
we
never
meet
again
with
an
ardour
of
passion
which
he
could
not
repress
arthur
philipson
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
maiden
whose
faltering
tone
had
clearly
expressed
that
she
felt
deeply
in
uttering
the
words
she
looked
round
for
annette
but
annette
had
disappeared
at
this
most
critical
moment
and
her
mistress
for
a
second
or
two
was
not
perhaps
sorry
for
her
absence
rise
she
said
arthur
rise
you
must
not
give
way
to
feelings
that
might
be
fatal
to
yourself
and
me
hear
me
lady
before
i
bid
you
adieu
and
for
ever
the
word
of
a
criminal
is
heard
though
he
plead
the
worst
cause
i
am
a
belted
knight
and
the
son
and
heir
of
an
earl
whose
name
has
been
spread
throughout
england
and
france
and
wherever
valour
has
had
fame
alas
said
she
faintly
i
have
but
too
long
suspected
what
you
now
tell
me
rise
i
pray
you
rise
never
till
you
hear
me
said
the
youth
seizing
one
of
her
hands
which
trembled
but
hardly
could
be
said
to
struggle
in
his
hear
me
he
said
with
the
enthusiasm
of
first
love
when
the
obstacles
of
bashfulness
and
diffidence
are
surmounted
my
father
and
i
are
i
acknowledge
it
bound
on
a
most
hazardous
and
doubtful
expedition
you
will
very
soon
learn
its
issue
for
good
or
bad
if
it
succeed
you
shall
hear
of
me
in
my
own
character
if
i
fall
i
must
i
will
i
do
claim
a
tear
from
anne
of
geierstein
if
i
escape
i
have
yet
a
horse
a
lance
and
a
sword
and
you
shall
hear
nobly
of
him
whom
you
have
thrice
protected
from
imminent
danger
arise
arise
repeated
the
maiden
whose
tears
began
to
flow
fast
as
struggling
to
raise
her
lover
they
fell
thick
upon
his
head
and
face
i
have
heard
enough
to
listen
to
more
were
indeed
madness
both
for
you
and
myself
yet
one
single
word
added
the
youth
while
arthur
has
a
heart
it
beats
for
you
while
arthur
can
wield
an
arm
it
strikes
for
you
and
in
your
cause
annette
now
rushed
into
the
room
away
away
she
cried
schreckenwald
has
returned
from
the
village
with
some
horrible
tidings
and
i
fear
me
he
comes
this
way
arthur
had
started
to
his
feet
at
the
first
signal
of
alarm
if
there
is
danger
near
your
lady
annette
there
is
at
least
one
faithful
friend
by
her
side
annette
looked
anxiously
at
her
mistress
but
schreckenwald
she
said
schreckenwald
your
steward
his
oh
think
better
of
it
i
can
hide
arthur
somewhere
the
girl
had
already
resumed
her
composure
and
replied
with
dignity
i
have
done
nothing
she
said
to
offend
my
father
if
schreckenwald
be
my
father
steward
he
is
my
vassal
i
hide
no
guest
to
conciliate
him
sit
down
addressing
arthur
and
let
us
receive
this
introduce
him
instantly
annette
and
let
us
hear
his
tidings
and
bid
him
remember
that
when
he
speaks
to
me
he
addresses
his
mistress
arthur
resumed
his
seat
still
more
proud
of
his
choice
from
the
noble
and
fearless
spirit
displayed
by
one
who
had
so
lately
shown
herself
sensible
to
the
gentlest
feelings
of
the
female
sex
annette
assuming
courage
from
her
mistress
dauntless
demeanour
clapped
her
hands
together
as
she
left
the
room
saying
but
in
a
low
voice
i
see
that
after
all
it
is
something
to
be
a
baroness
if
one
can
assert
her
dignity
conformingly
how
could
i
be
so
much
frightened
for
this
rude
man
chapter
affairs
that
walk
as
they
say
spirits
do
at
midnight
have
in
them
a
wilder
nature
than
the
business
that
seeks
dispatch
by
day
viii
act
the
approach
of
the
steward
was
now
boldly
expected
by
the
little
party
arthur
flattered
at
once
and
elevated
by
the
firmness
which
anne
had
shown
when
this
person
arrival
was
announced
hastily
considered
the
part
which
he
was
to
act
in
the
approaching
scene
and
prudently
determined
to
avoid
all
active
and
personal
interference
till
he
should
observe
from
the
demeanour
of
anne
that
such
was
likely
to
be
useful
or
agreeable
to
her
he
resumed
his
place
therefore
at
a
distant
part
of
the
board
on
which
their
meal
had
been
lately
spread
and
remained
there
determined
to
act
in
the
manner
behaviour
should
suggest
as
most
prudent
and
fitting
veiling
at
the
same
time
the
most
acute
internal
anxiety
by
an
appearance
of
that
deferential
composure
which
one
of
inferior
rank
adopts
when
admitted
to
the
presence
of
a
superior
anne
on
her
part
seemed
to
prepare
herself
for
an
interview
of
interest
an
air
of
conscious
dignity
succeeded
the
extreme
agitation
which
she
had
so
lately
displayed
and
busying
herself
with
some
articles
of
female
work
she
also
seemed
to
expect
with
tranquillity
the
visit
to
which
her
attendant
was
disposed
to
attach
so
much
alarm
a
step
was
heard
upon
the
stair
hurried
and
unequal
as
that
of
some
one
in
confusion
as
well
as
haste
the
door
flew
open
and
ital
schreckenwald
entered
this
person
with
whom
the
details
given
to
the
elder
philipson
by
the
landamman
biederman
have
made
the
reader
in
some
degree
acquainted
was
a
tall
soldierly
looking
man
his
dress
like
that
of
persons
of
rank
at
the
period
in
germany
was
more
varied
in
colour
more
cut
and
ornamented
slashed
and
jagged
than
the
habit
worn
in
france
and
england
the
hawk
feather
decked
his
cap
secured
with
a
medal
of
gold
which
served
as
a
clasp
his
doublet
was
of
buff
for
defence
but
as
it
was
called
in
the
tailor
craft
with
rich
lace
on
each
seam
and
displaying
on
the
breast
a
golden
chain
the
emblem
of
his
rank
in
the
household
he
entered
with
rather
a
hasty
step
and
busy
and
offended
look
and
said
somewhat
rudely
why
how
now
young
lady
wherefore
this
strangers
in
the
castle
at
this
period
of
night
anne
of
geierstein
though
she
had
been
long
absent
from
her
native
country
was
not
ignorant
of
its
habits
and
customs
and
knew
the
haughty
manner
in
which
all
who
were
noble
exerted
their
authority
over
their
dependants
are
you
a
vassal
of
arnheim
ital
schreckenwald
and
do
you
speak
to
the
lady
of
arnheim
in
her
own
castle
with
an
elevated
voice
a
saucy
look
and
bonneted
withal
know
your
place
and
when
you
have
demanded
pardon
for
your
insolence
and
told
your
errand
in
such
terms
as
befit
your
condition
and
mine
i
may
listen
to
what
you
have
to
say
schreckenwald
hand
in
spite
of
him
stole
to
his
bonnet
and
uncovered
his
haughty
brow
noble
lady
he
said
in
a
somewhat
milder
tone
excuse
me
if
my
haste
be
unmannerly
but
the
alarm
is
instant
the
soldiery
of
the
rhinegrave
have
mutinied
plucked
down
the
banners
of
their
master
and
set
up
an
independent
ensign
which
they
call
the
pennon
of
nicholas
under
which
they
declare
that
they
will
maintain
peace
with
god
and
war
with
all
the
world
this
castle
can
not
escape
them
when
they
consider
that
the
first
course
to
maintain
themselves
must
be
to
take
possession
of
some
place
of
strength
you
must
up
then
and
ride
with
the
very
peep
of
dawn
for
the
present
they
are
busy
with
the
of
the
peasants
but
when
they
wake
in
the
morning
they
will
unquestionably
march
hither
and
you
may
chance
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
who
will
think
of
the
terrors
of
the
castle
of
arnheim
as
the
figments
of
a
fairy
tale
and
laugh
at
its
pretensions
to
honour
and
respect
is
it
impossible
to
make
resistance
the
castle
is
strong
said
the
young
lady
and
i
am
unwilling
to
leave
the
house
of
my
fathers
without
attempting
somewhat
in
our
defence
five
hundred
men
said
schreckenwald
might
garrison
arnheim
battlement
and
tower
with
a
less
number
it
were
madness
to
attempt
to
keep
such
an
extent
of
walls
and
how
to
get
twenty
soldiers
together
i
am
sure
i
know
so
having
now
the
truth
of
the
story
let
me
beseech
you
to
dismiss
this
guest
too
young
i
think
to
be
the
inmate
of
a
lady
bower
and
i
will
point
to
him
the
nighest
way
out
of
the
castle
for
this
is
a
strait
in
which
we
must
all
be
contented
with
looking
to
our
own
safety
and
whither
is
it
that
you
propose
to
go
said
the
baroness
continuing
to
maintain
in
respect
to
ital
schreckenwald
the
complete
and
calm
assertion
of
absolute
superiority
to
which
the
seneschal
gave
way
with
such
marks
of
impatience
as
a
fiery
steed
exhibits
under
the
management
of
a
complete
cavalier
to
strasburg
i
propose
to
go
that
is
if
it
so
please
you
with
such
slight
escort
as
i
can
get
hastily
together
by
daybreak
i
trust
we
may
escape
being
observed
by
the
mutineers
or
if
we
fall
in
with
a
party
of
stragglers
i
apprehend
but
little
difficulty
in
forcing
my
way
and
wherefore
do
you
prefer
strasburg
as
a
place
of
asylum
because
i
trust
we
shall
there
meet
your
excellency
father
the
noble
count
albert
of
geierstein
it
is
well
said
the
young
you
also
i
think
seignor
philipson
spoke
of
directing
your
course
to
strasburg
if
it
consist
with
your
convenience
you
may
avail
yourself
of
the
protection
of
my
escort
as
far
as
that
city
where
you
expect
to
meet
your
father
it
will
readily
be
believed
that
arthur
cheerfully
bowed
assent
to
a
proposal
which
was
to
prolong
their
remaining
in
society
together
and
might
possibly
as
his
romantic
imagination
suggested
afford
him
an
opportunity
on
a
road
beset
with
dangers
to
render
some
service
of
importance
ital
schreckenwald
attempted
to
remonstrate
lady
lady
he
said
with
some
marks
of
impatience
take
breath
and
leisure
schreckenwald
said
anne
and
you
will
be
more
able
to
express
yourself
with
distinctness
and
with
respectful
propriety
the
impatient
vassal
muttered
an
oath
betwixt
his
teeth
and
answered
with
forced
civility
permit
me
to
state
that
our
case
requires
we
should
charge
ourselves
with
the
care
of
no
one
but
you
we
shall
be
few
enough
for
your
defence
and
i
can
not
permit
any
stranger
to
travel
with
us
if
said
arthur
i
conceived
that
i
was
to
be
a
useless
incumbrance
on
the
retreat
of
this
noble
young
lady
worlds
sir
squire
would
not
induce
me
to
accept
her
offer
but
i
am
neither
child
nor
woman
i
am
a
man
and
ready
to
show
such
good
service
as
manhood
may
in
defence
of
your
lady
if
we
must
not
challenge
your
valour
and
ability
young
sir
said
schreckenwald
who
shall
answer
for
your
fidelity
to
question
that
elsewhere
said
arthur
might
be
dangerous
but
anne
interfered
between
them
we
must
straight
to
rest
and
remain
prompt
for
alarm
perhaps
even
before
the
hour
of
dawn
schreckenwald
i
trust
to
your
care
for
due
watch
and
you
have
men
enough
at
least
for
that
and
hear
and
mark
it
is
my
desire
and
command
that
this
gentleman
be
accommodated
with
lodgings
here
for
this
night
and
that
he
travel
with
us
for
this
i
will
be
responsible
to
my
father
and
your
part
is
only
to
obey
my
commands
i
have
long
had
occasion
to
know
both
the
young
man
father
and
himself
who
were
ancient
guests
of
my
uncle
the
landamman
on
the
journey
you
will
keep
the
youth
beside
you
and
use
such
courtesy
to
him
as
your
rugged
temper
will
permit
ital
schreckenwald
intimated
his
acquiescence
with
a
look
of
bitterness
which
it
were
vain
to
attempt
to
describe
it
expressed
spite
mortification
humbled
pride
and
reluctant
submission
he
did
submit
however
and
ushered
young
philipson
into
a
decent
apartment
with
a
bed
which
the
fatigue
and
agitation
of
the
preceding
day
rendered
very
acceptable
notwithstanding
the
ardour
with
which
arthur
expected
the
rise
of
the
next
dawn
his
deep
repose
the
fruit
of
fatigue
held
him
until
the
reddening
of
the
east
when
the
voice
of
schreckenwald
exclaimed
up
sir
englishman
if
you
mean
to
accomplish
your
boast
of
loyal
service
it
is
time
we
were
in
the
saddle
and
we
shall
tarry
for
no
sluggards
arthur
was
on
the
floor
of
the
apartment
and
dressed
in
almost
an
instant
not
forgetting
to
put
on
his
shirt
of
mail
and
assume
whatever
weapons
seemed
most
fit
to
render
him
an
efficient
part
of
the
convoy
he
next
hastened
to
seek
out
the
stable
to
have
his
horse
in
readiness
and
descending
for
that
purpose
into
the
under
story
of
the
lower
mass
of
buildings
he
was
wandering
in
search
of
the
way
which
led
to
the
offices
when
the
voice
of
annette
veilchen
softly
whispered
this
way
seignor
philipson
i
would
speak
with
you
the
swiss
maiden
at
the
same
time
beckoned
him
into
a
small
room
where
he
found
her
alone
were
you
not
surprised
she
said
to
see
my
lady
queen
it
so
over
ital
schreckenwald
who
keeps
every
other
person
in
awe
with
his
stern
looks
and
cross
words
but
the
air
of
command
seems
so
natural
to
her
that
instead
of
being
a
baroness
she
might
have
been
an
empress
it
must
come
of
birth
i
think
after
all
for
i
tried
last
night
to
take
state
upon
me
after
the
fashion
of
my
mistress
and
would
you
think
it
the
brute
schreckenwald
threatened
to
throw
me
out
of
the
window
but
if
ever
i
see
martin
sprenger
again
i
know
if
there
is
strength
in
a
swiss
arm
and
virtue
in
a
swiss
but
here
i
stand
prating
and
my
lady
wishes
to
see
you
for
a
minute
ere
we
take
to
horse
your
lady
said
arthur
starting
why
did
you
lose
an
instant
why
not
tell
me
before
because
i
was
only
to
keep
you
here
till
she
came
and
here
she
is
anne
of
geierstein
entered
fully
attired
for
her
journey
annette
always
willing
to
do
as
she
would
wish
to
be
done
by
was
about
to
leave
the
apartment
when
her
mistress
who
had
apparently
made
up
her
mind
concerning
what
she
had
to
do
or
say
commanded
her
positively
to
remain
i
am
sure
she
said
seignor
philipson
will
rightly
understand
the
feelings
of
hospitality
i
will
say
of
friendship
which
prevented
my
suffering
him
to
be
expelled
from
my
castle
last
night
and
which
have
determined
me
this
morning
to
admit
of
his
company
on
the
somewhat
dangerous
road
to
strasburg
at
the
gate
of
that
town
we
part
i
to
join
my
father
you
to
place
yourself
under
the
direction
of
yours
from
that
moment
intercourse
between
us
ends
and
our
remembrance
of
each
other
must
be
as
the
thoughts
which
we
pay
to
friends
deceased
tender
recollections
said
arthur
passionately
more
dear
to
our
bosoms
than
all
we
have
surviving
upon
earth
not
a
word
in
that
tone
answered
the
maiden
with
night
delusion
should
end
and
reason
awaken
with
dawning
one
word
more
do
not
address
me
on
the
road
you
may
by
doing
so
expose
me
to
vexatious
and
insulting
suspicion
and
yourself
to
quarrels
and
farewell
our
party
is
ready
to
take
horse
she
left
the
apartment
where
arthur
remained
for
a
moment
deeply
bewildered
in
grief
and
disappointment
the
patience
nay
even
favour
with
which
anne
of
geierstein
had
on
the
previous
night
listened
to
his
passion
had
not
prepared
him
for
the
terms
of
reserve
and
distance
which
she
now
adopted
towards
him
he
was
ignorant
that
noble
maids
if
feeling
or
passion
has
for
a
moment
swayed
them
from
the
strict
path
of
principle
and
duty
endeavour
to
atone
for
it
by
instantly
returning
and
severely
adhering
to
the
line
from
which
they
have
made
a
momentary
departure
he
looked
mournfully
on
annette
who
as
she
had
been
in
the
room
before
anne
arrival
took
the
privilege
of
remaining
a
minute
after
her
departure
but
he
read
no
comfort
in
the
glances
of
the
confidant
who
seemed
as
much
disconcerted
as
himself
i
can
not
imagine
what
hath
happened
to
her
said
annette
to
me
she
is
kind
as
ever
but
to
every
other
person
about
her
she
plays
countess
and
baroness
with
a
witness
and
now
she
is
begun
to
tyrannise
over
her
own
natural
feelings
and
if
this
be
greatness
annette
veilchen
trusts
always
to
remain
the
penniless
swiss
girl
she
is
mistress
of
her
own
freedom
and
at
liberty
to
speak
with
her
bachelor
when
she
pleases
so
as
religion
and
maiden
modesty
suffer
nothing
in
the
conversation
oh
a
single
daisy
twisted
with
content
into
one
hair
is
worth
all
the
opals
in
india
if
they
bind
us
to
torment
ourselves
and
other
people
or
hinder
us
from
speaking
our
mind
when
our
heart
is
upon
our
tongue
but
never
fear
arthur
for
if
she
has
the
cruelty
to
think
of
forgetting
you
you
may
rely
on
one
friend
who
while
she
has
a
tongue
and
anne
has
ears
will
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
do
so
so
saying
away
tripped
annette
having
first
indicated
to
philipson
the
passage
by
which
he
would
find
the
lower
court
of
the
castle
there
his
steed
stood
ready
among
about
twenty
others
twelve
of
these
were
accoutred
with
war
saddles
and
frontlets
of
proof
being
intended
for
the
use
of
as
many
cavaliers
or
troopers
retainers
of
the
family
of
arnheim
whom
the
seneschal
exertions
had
been
able
to
collect
on
the
spur
of
the
occasion
two
palfreys
somewhat
distinguished
by
their
trappings
were
designed
for
anne
of
geierstein
and
her
favourite
female
attendant
the
other
menials
chiefly
boys
and
women
servants
had
inferior
horses
at
a
signal
made
the
troopers
took
their
lances
and
stood
by
their
steeds
till
the
females
and
menials
were
mounted
and
in
order
they
then
sprang
into
their
saddles
and
began
to
move
forward
slowly
and
with
great
precaution
schreckenwald
led
the
van
and
kept
arthur
philipson
close
beside
him
anne
and
her
attendant
were
in
the
centre
of
the
little
body
followed
by
the
unwarlike
train
of
servants
while
two
or
three
experienced
cavaliers
brought
up
the
rear
with
strict
orders
to
guard
against
surprise
on
their
being
put
into
motion
the
first
thing
which
surprised
arthur
was
that
the
horses
hoofs
no
longer
sent
forth
the
sharp
and
ringing
sound
arising
from
the
collision
of
iron
and
flint
and
as
the
morning
light
increased
he
could
perceive
that
the
fetlock
and
hoof
of
every
steed
his
own
included
had
been
carefully
wrapped
around
with
a
sufficient
quantity
of
wool
to
prevent
the
usual
noise
which
accompanied
their
motions
it
was
a
singular
thing
to
behold
the
passage
of
the
little
body
of
cavalry
down
the
rocky
road
which
led
from
the
castle
unattended
with
the
noise
which
we
are
disposed
to
consider
as
inseparable
from
the
motions
of
horse
the
absence
of
which
seemed
to
give
a
peculiar
and
almost
an
unearthly
appearance
to
the
cavalcade
they
passed
in
this
manner
the
winding
path
which
led
from
the
castle
of
arnheim
to
the
adjacent
village
which
as
was
the
ancient
feudal
custom
lay
so
near
the
fortress
that
its
inhabitants
when
summoned
by
their
lord
could
instantly
repair
for
its
defence
but
it
was
at
present
occupied
by
very
different
inhabitants
the
mutinous
soldiers
of
the
rhinegrave
when
the
party
from
arnheim
approached
the
entrance
of
the
village
schreckenwald
made
a
signal
to
halt
which
was
instantly
obeyed
by
his
followers
he
then
rode
forward
in
person
to
reconnoitre
accompanied
by
arthur
philipson
both
moving
with
the
utmost
steadiness
and
precaution
the
deepest
silence
prevailed
in
the
deserted
streets
here
and
there
a
soldier
was
seen
seemingly
designed
for
a
sentinel
but
uniformly
fast
asleep
the
swinish
mutineers
said
schreckenwald
a
fair
they
keep
and
a
beautiful
morning
rouse
would
i
treat
them
with
were
not
the
point
to
protect
yonder
peevish
halt
thou
here
stranger
while
i
ride
back
and
bring
them
on
there
is
no
danger
schreckenwald
left
arthur
as
he
spoke
who
alone
in
the
street
of
a
village
filled
with
banditti
though
they
were
lulled
into
temporary
insensibility
had
no
reason
to
consider
his
case
as
very
comfortable
the
chorus
of
a
wassel
song
which
some
reveller
was
trolling
over
in
his
sleep
or
in
its
turn
the
growling
of
some
village
cur
seemed
the
signal
for
an
hundred
ruffians
to
start
up
around
him
but
in
the
space
of
two
or
three
minutes
the
noiseless
cavalcade
headed
by
ital
schreckenwald
again
joined
him
and
followed
their
leader
observing
the
utmost
precaution
not
to
give
an
alarm
all
went
well
till
they
reached
the
farther
end
of
the
village
where
although
the
who
kept
guard
was
as
drunk
as
his
companions
on
duty
a
large
shaggy
dog
which
lay
beside
him
was
more
vigilant
as
the
little
troop
approached
the
animal
sent
forth
a
ferocious
yell
loud
enough
to
have
broken
the
rest
of
the
seven
sleepers
and
which
effectually
dispelled
the
slumbers
of
its
master
the
soldier
snatched
up
his
carabine
and
fired
he
knew
not
well
at
what
or
for
what
reason
the
ball
however
struck
arthur
horse
under
him
and
as
the
animal
fell
the
sentinel
rushed
forward
to
kill
or
make
prisoner
the
rider
haste
on
haste
on
men
of
arnheim
care
for
nothing
but
the
young
lady
safety
exclaimed
the
leader
of
the
band
stay
i
command
you
aid
the
stranger
on
your
lives
said
anne
in
a
voice
which
usually
gentle
and
meek
she
now
made
heard
by
those
around
her
like
the
note
of
a
silver
clarion
i
will
not
stir
till
he
is
rescued
schreckenwald
had
already
spurred
his
horse
for
flight
but
perceiving
anne
reluctance
to
follow
him
he
dashed
back
and
seizing
a
horse
which
bridled
and
saddled
stood
picketed
near
him
he
threw
the
reins
to
arthur
philipson
and
pushing
his
own
horse
at
the
same
time
betwixt
the
englishman
and
the
soldier
he
forced
the
latter
to
quit
the
hold
he
had
on
his
person
in
an
instant
philipson
was
again
mounted
when
seizing
a
which
hung
at
the
of
his
new
steed
he
struck
down
the
staggering
sentinel
who
was
endeavouring
again
to
seize
upon
him
the
whole
troop
then
rode
off
at
a
gallop
for
the
alarm
began
to
grow
general
in
the
village
some
soldiers
were
seen
coming
out
of
their
quarters
and
others
were
beginning
to
get
upon
horseback
before
schreckenwald
and
his
party
had
ridden
a
mile
they
heard
more
than
once
the
sound
of
bugles
and
when
they
arrived
upon
the
summit
of
an
eminence
commanding
a
view
of
the
village
their
leader
who
during
the
retreat
had
placed
himself
in
the
rear
of
his
company
now
halted
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
they
had
left
behind
them
there
was
bustle
and
confusion
in
the
street
but
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
pursuit
so
that
schreckenwald
followed
his
route
down
the
river
with
speed
and
activity
indeed
but
with
so
much
steadiness
at
the
same
time
as
not
to
distress
the
slowest
horse
of
his
party
when
they
had
ridden
two
hours
and
more
the
confidence
of
their
leader
was
so
much
augmented
that
he
ventured
to
command
a
halt
at
the
edge
of
a
pleasant
grove
which
served
to
conceal
their
number
whilst
both
riders
and
horses
took
some
refreshment
for
which
purpose
forage
and
provisions
had
been
borne
along
with
them
ital
schreckenwald
having
held
some
communication
with
the
baroness
continued
to
offer
their
travelling
companion
a
sort
of
surly
civility
he
invited
him
to
partake
of
his
own
mess
which
was
indeed
little
different
from
that
which
was
served
out
to
the
other
troopers
but
was
seasoned
with
a
glass
of
wine
from
a
more
choice
flask
to
your
health
brother
he
said
if
you
tell
this
day
story
truly
you
will
allow
that
i
was
a
true
comrade
to
you
two
hours
since
in
riding
through
the
village
of
arnheim
i
will
never
deny
it
fair
sir
said
philipson
and
i
return
you
thanks
for
your
timely
assistance
alike
whether
it
sprang
from
your
mistress
order
or
your
own
ho
ho
my
friend
said
schreckenwald
laughing
you
are
a
philosopher
and
can
try
conclusions
while
your
horse
lies
rolling
above
you
and
a
aims
his
sword
at
your
throat
well
since
your
wit
hath
discovered
so
much
i
care
not
if
you
know
that
i
should
not
have
had
much
scruple
to
sacrifice
twenty
such
gentlemen
as
yourself
rather
than
the
young
baroness
of
arnheim
had
incurred
the
slightest
danger
the
propriety
of
the
sentiment
said
philipson
is
so
undoubtedly
correct
that
i
subscribe
to
it
even
though
it
is
something
discourteously
expressed
towards
myself
in
making
this
reply
the
young
man
provoked
at
the
insolence
of
schreckenwald
manner
raised
his
voice
a
little
the
circumstance
did
not
escape
observation
for
on
the
instant
annette
veilchen
stood
before
them
with
her
mistress
commands
on
them
both
to
speak
in
whispers
or
rather
to
be
altogether
silent
say
to
your
mistress
that
i
am
mute
said
philipson
our
mistress
the
baroness
says
continued
annette
with
an
emphasis
on
the
title
to
which
she
began
to
ascribe
some
talismanic
influence
the
baroness
i
tell
you
says
that
silence
much
concerns
our
safety
for
it
were
most
hazardous
to
draw
upon
this
little
fugitive
party
the
notice
of
any
passengers
who
may
pass
along
the
road
during
the
necessary
halt
and
so
sirs
it
is
the
request
that
you
will
continue
the
exercise
of
your
teeth
as
fast
as
you
can
and
forbear
that
of
your
tongues
till
you
are
in
a
safer
condition
my
lady
is
wise
answered
ital
schreckenwald
and
her
maiden
is
witty
i
drink
annette
in
a
cup
of
rudersheimer
to
the
continuance
of
her
sagacity
and
of
your
amiable
liveliness
of
disposition
will
it
please
you
fair
mistress
to
pledge
me
in
this
generous
liquor
out
thou
german
out
thou
eternal
heard
you
ever
of
a
modest
maiden
who
drank
wine
before
she
had
dined
remain
without
the
generous
inspiration
then
said
the
german
and
nourish
thy
satirical
vein
on
sour
cider
or
acid
whey
a
short
space
having
been
allowed
to
refresh
themselves
the
little
party
again
mounted
their
horses
and
travelled
with
such
speed
that
long
before
noon
they
arrived
at
the
strongly
fortified
town
of
kehl
opposite
to
strasburg
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
rhine
it
is
for
local
antiquaries
to
discover
whether
the
travellers
crossed
from
kehl
to
strasburg
by
the
celebrated
bridge
of
boats
which
at
present
maintains
the
communication
across
the
river
or
whether
they
were
wafted
over
by
some
other
mode
of
transportation
it
is
enough
that
they
passed
in
safety
and
had
landed
on
the
other
side
where
whether
she
dreaded
that
he
might
forget
the
charge
she
had
given
him
that
here
they
were
to
separate
or
whether
she
thought
that
something
more
might
be
said
in
the
moment
of
parting
the
young
baroness
before
remounting
her
horse
once
more
approached
arthur
philipson
who
too
truly
guessed
the
tenor
of
what
she
had
to
say
gentle
stranger
she
said
i
must
now
bid
you
farewell
but
first
let
me
ask
if
you
know
whereabouts
you
are
to
seek
your
father
in
an
inn
called
the
flying
stag
said
arthur
dejectedly
but
where
that
is
situated
in
this
large
town
i
know
not
do
you
know
the
place
ital
schreckenwald
i
young
lady
not
i
i
know
nothing
of
strasburg
and
its
inns
i
believe
most
of
our
party
are
as
ignorant
as
i
am
you
and
they
speak
german
i
suppose
said
the
baroness
drily
and
can
make
inquiry
more
easily
than
a
foreigner
go
sir
and
forget
not
that
humanity
to
the
stranger
is
a
religious
duty
with
that
shrug
of
the
shoulders
which
testifies
a
displeased
messenger
ital
went
to
make
some
inquiry
and
in
his
absence
brief
as
it
was
anne
took
an
opportunity
to
say
apart
farewell
farewell
accept
this
token
of
friendship
and
wear
it
for
my
sake
may
you
be
happy
her
slender
fingers
dropped
into
his
hand
a
very
small
parcel
he
turned
to
thank
her
but
she
was
already
at
some
distance
and
schreckenwald
who
had
taken
his
place
by
his
side
said
in
his
harsh
voice
come
sir
squire
i
have
found
out
your
place
of
rendezvous
and
i
have
but
little
time
to
play
the
he
then
rode
on
and
philipson
mounted
on
his
military
charger
followed
him
in
silence
to
the
point
where
a
large
street
joined
or
rather
crossed
that
which
led
from
the
quay
on
which
they
had
landed
yonder
swings
the
flying
stag
said
ital
pointing
to
an
immense
sign
which
mounted
on
a
huge
wooden
frame
crossed
almost
the
whole
breadth
of
the
street
your
intelligence
can
i
think
hardly
abandon
you
with
such
a
in
your
eye
so
saying
he
turned
his
horse
without
further
farewell
and
rode
back
to
join
his
mistress
and
her
attendants
philipson
eyes
rested
on
the
same
group
for
a
moment
when
he
was
recalled
to
a
sense
of
his
situation
by
the
thoughts
of
his
father
and
spurring
his
jaded
horse
down
the
cross
street
he
reached

hostelry

to

with
a
degree
of
condescension

in
the
privileged
race
to
which
she
belonged
was
little
short
of
degradation
she
not

put
her

buskins
and
her
pretty

in
danger
of
being
soiled
by
tripping
across
the
yard
to
point
out

on

after
his

condescended
to
recollect
that
such
a
guest
as
he
described
had
lodged
in
the
house
last
night
and
had
said
he
expected
to
meet
there

a
smile

be
valued

rare
occurrence

have
been
reckoned
inestimable
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
in
a
few
instants
the
elder
philipson
entered
the
stable
and
folded
his
son
in
his
arms

me
at
all
times
welcome
in
a
period
of
doubt
and
danger
and
most
welcome
of
all
in
a
moment
which
forms
the
very
crisis
of
our
fate
in
a
few
hours
i
shall
know
what
we
may
expect
from
the
duke

the
token
arthur
hand
first
sought
that
which
was
nearest
to
his
heart
both
in
the
literal
and
allegorical
sense
the
small
parcel
namely
which
anne
had
given
him
at
parting
but
he
recollected
himself
in
the
instant
and
presented
to
his
father
the
packet
which
had
been
so
strangely
lost
and
recovered
at
la
ferette
it
hath
run
its
own
risk
since
you
saw
it
he
observed
to
his
father
and
so
have
i
mine
i
received
hospitality
at
a
castle
last
night
and
behold
a
body
of
lanzknechts
in
the
neighbourhood
began
in
the
morning
to
mutiny
for
their
pay
the
inhabitants
fled
from
the
castle
to
escape
their
violence
and
as
we
passed
their
leaguer
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
a
drunken
shot
my
poor
horse
and
i
was
forced
in
the
way
of
exchange
to
take
up
with
his
heavy
flemish
animal
with
its
steel
saddle
and
its
clumsy
chaffron
our
road
is
beset
with
perils
said
his
father
i
too
have
had
my
share
having
been
in
great
danger
he
told
not
its
precise
nature
at
an
inn
where
i
rested
last
night
but
i
left
it
in
the
morning
and
proceeded
hither
in
safety
i
have
at
length
however
obtained
a
safe
escort
to
conduct
me
to
the
duke
camp
near
dijon
and
i
trust
to
have
an
audience
of
him
this
evening
then
if
our
last
hope
should
fail
we
will
seek
the
seaport
of
marseilles
hoist
sail
for
candia
or
for
rhodes
and
spend
our
lives
in
defence
of
christendom
since
we
may
no
longer
fight
for
england
arthur
heard
these
ominous
words
without
reply
but
they
did
not
the
less
sink
upon
his
heart
deadly
as
the
doom
of
the
judge
which
secludes
the
criminal
from
society
and
all
its
joys
and
condemns
him
to
an
eternal
the
bells
from
the
cathedral
began
to
toll
at
this
instant
and
reminded
the
elder
philipson
of
the
duty
of
hearing
mass
which
was
said
at
all
hours
in
some
one
or
other
of
the
separate
chapels
which
are
contained
in
that
magnificent
pile
his
son
followed
on
an
intimation
of
his
pleasure
in
approaching
the
access
to
this
superb
cathedral
the
travellers
found
it
obstructed
as
is
usual
in
catholic
countries
by
the
number
of
mendicants
of
both
sexes
who
crowded
round
the
entrance
to
give
the
worshippers
an
opportunity
of
discharging
the
duty
of
so
positively
enjoined
as
a
chief
observance
of
their
church
the
englishmen
extricated
themselves
from
their
importunity
by
bestowing
as
is
usual
on
such
occasions
a
donative
of
small
coin
upon
those
who
appeared
most
needy
or
most
deserving
of
their
charity
one
tall
woman
stood
on
the
steps
close
to
the
door
and
extended
her
hand
to
the
elder
philipson
who
struck
with
her
appearance
exchanged
for
a
piece
of
silver
the
copper
coins
which
he
had
been
distributing
amongst
others
a
marvel
she
said
in
the
english
language
but
in
a
tone
calculated
only
to
be
heard
by
him
alone
although
his
son
also
caught
the
sound
and
sense
of
what
she
said
ay
a
miracle
an
englishman
still
possesses
a
silver
piece
and
can
afford
to
bestow
it
on
the
poor
arthur
was
sensible
that
his
father
started
somewhat
at
the
voice
or
words
which
bore
even
in
his
ear
something
of
deeper
import
than
the
observation
of
an
ordinary
mendicant
but
after
a
glance
at
the
female
who
thus
addressed
him
his
father
passed
onwards
into
the
body
of
the
church
and
was
soon
engaged
in
attending
to
the
solemn
ceremony
of
the
mass
as
it
was
performed
by
a
priest
at
the
altar
of
a
chapel
divided
from
the
main
body
of
the
splendid
edifice
and
dedicated
as
it
appeared
from
the
image
over
the
altar
to
george
that
military
saint
whose
real
history
is
so
obscure
though
his
popular
legend
rendered
him
an
object
of
peculiar
veneration
during
the
feudal
ages
the
ceremony
was
begun
and
finished
with
all
customary
forms
the
officiating
priest
with
his
attendants
withdrew
and
though
some
of
the
few
worshippers
who
had
assisted
at
the
solemnity
remained
telling
their
beads
and
occupied
with
the
performance
of
their
private
devotions
far
the
greater
part
left
the
chapel
to
visit
other
shrines
or
to
return
to
the
prosecution
of
their
secular
affairs
but
arthur
philipson
remarked
that
whilst
they
dropped
off
one
after
another
the
tall
woman
who
had
received
his
father
alms
continued
to
kneel
near
the
altar
and
he
was
yet
more
surprised
to
see
that
his
father
himself
who
he
had
many
reasons
to
know
was
desirous
to
spend
in
the
church
no
more
time
than
the
duties
of
devotion
absolutely
claimed
remained
also
on
his
knees
with
his
eyes
resting
on
the
form
of
the
veiled
devotee
such
she
seemed
from
her
dress
as
if
his
own
motions
were
to
be
guided
by
hers
by
no
idea
which
occurred
to
him
was
arthur
able
to
form
the
least
conjecture
as
to
his
father
motives
he
only
knew
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
critical
and
dangerous
negotiation
liable
to
influence
or
interruption
from
various
quarters
and
that
political
suspicion
was
so
generally
awake
both
in
france
italy
and
flanders
that
the
most
important
agents
were
often
obliged
to
assume
the
most
impenetrable
disguises
in
order
to
insinuate
themselves
without
suspicion
into
the
countries
where
their
services
were
required
louis
in
particular
whose
singular
policy
seemed
in
some
degree
to
give
a
character
to
the
age
in
which
he
lived
was
well
known
to
have
disguised
his
principal
emissaries
and
envoys
in
the
fictitious
garbs
of
mendicant
monks
minstrels
gypsies
and
other
privileged
wanderers
of
the
meanest
description
arthur
concluded
therefore
that
it
was
not
improbable
that
this
female
might
like
themselves
be
something
more
than
her
dress
imported
and
he
resolved
to
observe
his
father
deportment
towards
her
and
regulate
his
own
actions
accordingly
a
bell
at
last
announced
that
mass
upon
a
more
splendid
scale
was
about
to
be
celebrated
before
the
high
altar
of
the
cathedral
itself
and
its
sound
withdrew
from
the
sequestered
chapel
of
george
the
few
who
had
remained
at
the
shrine
of
the
military
saint
excepting
the
father
and
son
and
the
female
penitent
who
kneeled
opposite
to
them
when
the
last
of
the
worshippers
had
retired
the
female
arose
and
advanced
towards
the
elder
philipson
who
folding
his
arms
on
his
bosom
and
stooping
his
head
in
an
attitude
of
obeisance
which
his
son
had
never
before
seen
him
assume
appeared
rather
to
wait
what
she
had
to
say
than
to
propose
addressing
her
there
was
a
pause
four
lamps
lighted
before
the
shrine
of
the
saint
cast
a
dim
radiance
on
his
armour
and
steed
represented
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
transfixing
with
his
lance
the
prostrate
dragon
whose
outstretched
wings
and
writhing
neck
were
in
part
touched
by
their
beams
the
rest
of
the
chapel
was
dimly
illuminated
by
the
autumnal
sun
which
could
scarce
find
its
way
through
the
stained
panes
of
the
small
lanceolated
window
which
was
its
only
aperture
to
the
open
air
the
light
fell
doubtful
and
gloomy
tinged
with
the
various
hues
through
which
it
passed
upon
the
stately
yet
somewhat
broken
and
dejected
form
of
the
female
and
on
those
of
the
melancholy
and
anxious
father
and
his
son
who
with
all
the
eager
interest
of
youth
suspected
and
anticipated
extraordinary
consequences
from
so
singular
an
interview
at
length
the
female
approached
to
the
same
side
of
the
shrine
with
arthur
and
his
father
as
if
to
be
more
distinctly
heard
without
being
obliged
to
raise
the
slow
solemn
voice
in
which
she
had
spoken
do
you
here
worship
she
said
the
george
of
burgundy
or
the
george
of
merry
england
the
flower
of
chivalry
i
serve
said
philipson
folding
his
hands
humbly
on
his
bosom
the
saint
to
whom
this
chapel
is
dedicated
and
the
deity
with
whom
i
hope
for
his
holy
intercession
whether
here
or
in
my
native
country
ay
you
said
the
female
even
you
can
forget
you
even
you
who
have
been
numbered
among
the
mirror
of
knighthood
can
forget
that
you
have
worshipped
in
the
royal
fane
of
windsor
that
you
have
there
bent
a
knee
where
kings
and
princes
kneeled
around
you
you
can
forget
this
and
make
your
orisons
at
a
foreign
shrine
with
a
heart
undisturbed
with
the
thoughts
of
what
you
have
been
praying
like
some
poor
peasant
for
bread
and
life
during
the
day
that
passes
over
you
lady
replied
philipson
in
my
proudest
hours
i
was
before
the
being
to
whom
i
preferred
my
prayers
but
as
a
worm
in
the
dust
in
his
eyes
i
am
now
neither
less
nor
more
degraded
as
i
may
be
in
the
opinion
of
my
how
canst
thou
think
thus
said
the
devotee
and
yet
it
is
well
with
thee
that
thou
canst
but
what
have
thy
losses
been
compared
to
mine
she
put
her
hand
to
her
brow
and
seemed
for
a
moment
overpowered
by
agonising
recollections
arthur
pressed
to
his
father
side
and
inquired
in
a
tone
of
interest
which
could
not
be
repressed
father
who
is
this
lady
is
it
my
mother
no
my
son
answered
philipson
peace
for
the
sake
of
all
you
hold
dear
or
holy
the
singular
female
however
heard
both
the
question
and
answer
though
expressed
in
a
whisper
yes
she
said
young
man
i
am
i
should
say
i
was
your
mother
the
mother
the
protectress
of
all
that
was
noble
in
england
i
am
margaret
of
anjou
arthur
sank
on
his
knees
before
the
dauntless
widow
of
henry
the
sixth
who
so
long
and
in
such
desperate
circumstances
upheld
by
unyielding
courage
and
deep
policy
the
sinking
cause
of
her
feeble
husband
and
who
if
she
occasionally
abused
victory
by
cruelty
and
revenge
had
made
some
atonement
by
the
indomitable
resolution
with
which
she
had
supported
the
fiercest
storms
of
adversity
arthur
had
been
bred
in
devoted
adherence
to
the
now
dethroned
line
of
lancaster
of
which
his
father
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
supporters
and
his
earliest
deeds
of
arms
which
though
unfortunate
were
neither
obscure
nor
ignoble
had
been
done
in
their
cause
with
an
enthusiasm
belonging
to
his
age
and
education
he
in
the
same
instant
flung
his
bonnet
on
the
pavement
and
knelt
at
the
feet
of
his
sovereign
margaret
threw
back
the
veil
which
concealed
those
noble
and
majestic
features
which
even
yet
though
rivers
of
tears
had
furrowed
her
cheek
though
care
disappointment
domestic
grief
and
humbled
pride
had
quenched
the
fire
of
her
eye
and
wasted
the
smooth
dignity
of
her
forehead
even
yet
showed
the
remains
of
that
beauty
which
once
was
held
unequalled
in
europe
the
apathy
with
which
a
succession
of
misfortunes
and
disappointed
hopes
had
chilled
the
feelings
of
the
unfortunate
princess
was
for
a
moment
melted
by
the
sight
of
the
fair
youth
enthusiasm
she
abandoned
one
hand
to
him
which
he
covered
with
tears
and
kisses
and
with
the
other
stroked
with
maternal
tenderness
his
curled
locks
as
she
endeavoured
to
raise
him
from
the
posture
he
had
assumed
his
father
in
the
meanwhile
shut
the
door
of
the
chapel
and
placed
his
back
against
it
withdrawing
himself
thus
from
the
group
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
any
stranger
from
entering
during
a
scene
so
extraordinary
and
thou
then
said
margaret
in
a
voice
where
female
tenderness
combated
strangely
with
her
natural
pride
of
rank
and
with
the
calm
stoical
indifference
induced
by
the
intensity
of
her
personal
misfortunes
thou
fair
youth
art
the
last
scion
of
the
noble
stem
so
many
fair
boughs
of
which
have
fallen
in
our
hapless
cause
alas
alas
what
can
i
do
for
thee
margaret
has
not
even
a
blessing
to
bestow
so
wayward
is
her
fate
that
her
benedictions
are
curses
and
she
has
but
to
look
on
you
and
wish
you
well
to
insure
your
speedy
and
utter
ruin
i
i
have
been
the
fatal
whose
influence
has
blighted
and
destroyed
all
the
fair
plants
that
arose
beside
and
around
me
and
brought
death
upon
every
one
yet
am
myself
unable
to
find
it
noble
and
royal
mistress
said
the
elder
englishman
let
not
your
princely
courage
which
has
borne
such
extremities
be
dismayed
now
that
they
are
passed
over
and
that
a
chance
at
least
of
happier
times
is
approaching
to
you
and
to
england
to
england
to
noble
oxford
said
the
forlorn
and
widowed
if
sun
could
place
me
once
more
on
the
throne
of
england
could
it
give
back
to
me
what
i
have
lost
i
speak
not
of
wealth
or
power
they
are
as
nothing
in
the
balance
i
speak
not
of
the
hosts
of
noble
friends
who
have
fallen
in
defence
of
me
and
mine
somersets
percys
staffords
cliffords
they
have
found
their
place
in
fame
in
the
annals
of
their
country
i
speak
not
of
my
husband
he
has
exchanged
the
state
of
a
suffering
saint
upon
earth
for
that
of
a
glorified
saint
in
heaven
but
oh
oxford
my
son
my
edward
is
it
possible
for
me
to
look
on
this
youth
and
not
remember
that
thy
countess
and
i
on
the
same
night
gave
birth
to
two
fair
boys
how
oft
we
endeavoured
to
prophesy
their
future
fortunes
and
to
persuade
ourselves
that
the
same
constellation
which
shone
on
their
birth
would
influence
their
succeeding
life
and
hold
a
friendly
and
equal
bias
till
they
reached
some
destined
goal
of
happiness
and
honour
thy
arthur
lives
but
alas
my
edward
born
under
the
same
auspices
fills
a
bloody
grave
she
wrapped
her
head
in
her
mantle
as
if
to
stifle
the
complaints
and
groans
which
maternal
affection
poured
forth
at
these
cruel
recollections
philipson
or
the
exiled
earl
of
oxford
as
we
may
now
term
him
distinguished
in
those
changeful
times
by
the
steadiness
with
which
he
had
always
maintained
his
loyalty
to
the
line
of
lancaster
saw
the
imprudence
of
indulging
his
sovereign
in
her
weakness
illustration
arthur
before
the
queen
drawn
and
etched
by
de
los
rios
royal
mistress
he
said
life
journey
is
that
of
a
brief
day
and
its
course
will
run
on
whether
we
avail
ourselves
of
its
progress
or
no
my
sovereign
is
i
trust
too
much
mistress
of
herself
to
suffer
lamentation
for
what
is
passed
to
deprive
her
of
the
power
of
using
the
present
time
i
am
here
in
obedience
to
your
command
i
am
to
see
burgundy
forthwith
and
if
i
find
him
pliant
to
the
purpose
to
which
we
would
turn
him
events
may
follow
which
will
change
into
gladness
our
present
mourning
but
we
must
use
our
opportunity
with
speed
as
well
as
zeal
let
me
know
then
madam
for
what
reason
your
majesty
hath
come
hither
disguised
and
in
danger
surely
it
was
not
merely
to
weep
over
this
young
man
that
the
queen
margaret
left
her
father
court
disguised
herself
in
mean
attire
and
came
from
a
place
of
safety
to
one
of
doubt
at
least
if
not
of
danger
you
mock
me
oxford
said
the
unfortunate
queen
or
you
deceive
yourself
if
you
think
you
still
serve
that
margaret
whose
word
was
never
spoken
without
a
reason
and
whose
slightest
action
was
influenced
by
a
motive
alas
i
am
no
longer
the
same
firm
and
rational
being
the
feverish
character
of
grief
while
it
makes
one
place
hateful
to
me
drives
me
to
another
in
very
impotence
and
impatience
of
spirit
my
father
residence
thou
is
safe
but
is
it
tolerable
for
such
a
soul
as
mine
can
one
who
has
been
deprived
of
the
noblest
and
richest
kingdom
of
europe
one
who
has
lost
hosts
of
noble
friends
one
who
is
a
widowed
consort
a
childless
mother
one
upon
whose
head
heaven
hath
poured
forth
its
last
vial
of
unmitigated
wrath
can
she
stoop
to
be
the
companion
of
a
weak
old
man
who
in
sonnets
and
in
music
in
mummery
and
folly
in
harping
and
rhyming
finds
a
comfort
for
all
that
poverty
has
that
is
distressing
and
what
is
still
worse
even
a
solace
in
all
that
is
ridiculous
and
contemptible
nay
with
your
leave
madam
said
her
counsellor
blame
not
the
good
king
rené
because
persecuted
by
fortune
he
has
been
able
to
find
out
for
himself
humbler
sources
of
solace
which
your
prouder
spirit
is
disposed
to
disdain
a
contention
among
his
minstrels
has
for
him
the
animation
of
a
knightly
combat
and
a
crown
of
flowers
twined
by
his
troubadours
and
graced
by
their
sonnets
he
accounts
a
valuable
compensation
for
the
diadems
of
jerusalem
of
naples
and
of
both
sicilies
of
which
he
only
possesses
the
empty
titles
speak
not
to
me
of
the
pitiable
old
man
said
margaret
sunk
below
even
the
hatred
of
his
worst
enemies
and
never
thought
worthy
of
anything
more
than
contempt
i
tell
thee
noble
oxford
i
have
been
driven
nearly
mad
with
my
forced
residence
at
aix
in
the
paltry
circle
which
he
calls
his
court
my
ears
tuned
as
they
now
are
only
to
sounds
of
affliction
are
not
so
weary
of
the
eternal
tinkling
of
harps
and
squeaking
of
rebecks
and
snapping
of
castanets
my
eyes
are
not
so
tired
of
the
beggarly
affectation
of
court
ceremonial
which
is
only
respectable
when
it
implies
wealth
and
expresses
power
as
my
very
soul
is
sick
of
the
paltry
ambition
which
can
find
pleasure
in
spangles
tassels
and
trumpery
when
the
reality
of
all
that
is
great
and
noble
hath
passed
away
no
oxford
if
i
am
doomed
to
lose
the
last
cast
which
fickle
fortune
seems
to
offer
me
i
will
retreat
into
the
meanest
convent
in
the
pyrenean
hills
and
at
least
escape
the
insult
of
the
idiot
gaiety
of
my
let
him
pass
from
our
memory
as
from
the
page
of
history
in
which
his
name
will
never
be
recorded
i
have
much
of
more
importance
both
to
hear
and
to
and
now
my
oxford
what
news
from
italy
will
the
duke
of
milan
afford
us
assistance
with
his
counsels
or
with
his
treasures
with
his
counsels
willingly
madam
but
how
you
will
relish
them
i
know
not
since
he
recommends
to
us
submission
to
our
hapless
fate
and
resignation
to
the
will
of
providence
the
wily
italian
will
not
then
galeasso
advance
any
part
of
his
hoards
or
assist
a
friend
to
whom
he
hath
in
his
time
full
often
sworn
faith
not
even
the
diamonds
which
i
offered
to
deposit
in
his
hands
answered
the
earl
could
make
him
unlock
his
treasury
to
supply
us
with
ducats
for
our
enterprise
yet
he
said
if
charles
of
burgundy
should
think
seriously
of
an
exertion
in
our
favour
such
was
his
regard
for
that
great
prince
and
his
deep
sense
of
your
misfortunes
that
he
would
consider
what
the
state
of
his
exchequer
though
much
exhausted
and
the
condition
of
his
subjects
though
impoverished
by
taxes
and
talliages
would
permit
him
to
advance
in
your
behalf
the
hypocrite
said
margaret
if
the
assistance
of
the
princely
burgundy
lends
us
a
chance
of
regaining
what
is
our
own
then
he
will
give
us
some
paltry
parcel
of
crowns
that
our
restored
prosperity
may
forget
his
indifference
to
our
adversity
but
what
of
burgundy
i
have
ventured
hither
to
tell
you
what
i
have
learned
and
to
hear
report
of
your
proceedings
a
trusty
watch
provides
for
the
secrecy
of
our
interview
my
impatience
to
see
you
brought
me
hither
in
this
mean
disguise
i
have
a
small
retinue
at
a
convent
a
mile
beyond
the
town
i
have
had
your
arrival
watched
by
the
faithful
lambert
and
now
i
come
to
know
your
hopes
or
your
fears
and
to
tell
you
my
own
royal
lady
said
the
earl
i
have
not
seen
the
duke
you
know
his
temper
to
be
wilful
sudden
haughty
and
unpersuadable
if
he
can
adopt
the
calm
and
sustained
policy
which
the
times
require
i
little
doubt
his
obtaining
full
amends
of
louis
his
sworn
enemy
and
even
of
edward
his
ambitious
but
if
he
continues
to
yield
to
extravagant
fits
of
passion
with
or
without
provocation
he
may
hurry
into
a
quarrel
with
the
poor
but
hardy
helvetians
and
is
likely
to
engage
in
a
perilous
contest
in
which
he
can
not
be
expected
to
gain
anything
while
he
undergoes
a
chance
of
the
most
serious
losses
surely
replied
the
queen
he
will
not
trust
the
usurper
edward
even
in
the
very
moment
when
he
is
giving
the
greatest
proof
of
treachery
to
his
alliance
in
what
respect
madam
replied
oxford
the
news
you
allude
to
has
not
reached
me
how
my
lord
am
i
then
the
first
to
tell
you
that
edward
of
york
has
crossed
the
sea
with
such
an
army
as
scarce
even
the
renowned
henry
my
ever
transported
from
france
to
italy
so
much
i
have
indeed
heard
was
expected
said
oxford
and
i
anticipated
the
effect
as
fatal
to
our
cause
edward
is
arrived
said
margaret
and
the
traitor
and
usurper
hath
sent
defiance
to
louis
of
france
and
demanded
of
him
the
crown
of
that
kingdom
as
his
own
right
that
crown
which
was
placed
on
the
head
of
my
unhappy
husband
when
he
was
yet
a
child
in
the
cradle
it
is
then
decided
the
english
are
in
france
answered
oxford
in
a
tone
expressive
of
the
deepest
and
whom
brings
edward
with
him
on
this
expedition
all
all
the
bitterest
enemies
of
our
house
and
cause
the
false
the
traitorous
the
dishonoured
george
whom
he
calls
duke
of
clarence
the
richard
the
licentious
hastings
howard
stanley
in
a
word
the
leaders
of
all
those
traitors
whom
i
would
not
name
unless
by
doing
so
my
curses
could
sweep
them
from
the
face
of
the
earth
and
i
tremble
to
ask
said
the
earl
does
burgundy
prepare
to
join
them
as
a
brother
of
the
war
and
make
common
cause
with
this
yorkish
host
against
king
louis
of
france
by
my
advices
replied
the
queen
and
they
are
both
private
and
sure
besides
that
they
are
confirmed
by
the
bruit
of
common
fame
no
my
good
oxford
no
for
that
may
the
saints
be
praised
answered
oxford
edward
of
york
i
will
not
malign
even
an
enemy
is
a
bold
and
fearless
leader
but
he
is
neither
edward
the
third
nor
the
heroic
black
prince
nor
is
he
that
fifth
henry
of
lancaster
under
whom
i
won
my
spurs
and
to
whose
lineage
the
thoughts
of
his
glorious
memory
would
have
made
me
faithful
had
my
plighted
vows
of
allegiance
ever
permitted
me
to
entertain
a
thought
of
varying
or
of
defection
let
edward
engage
in
war
with
louis
without
the
aid
of
burgundy
on
which
he
has
reckoned
louis
is
indeed
no
hero
but
he
is
a
cautious
and
skilful
general
more
to
be
dreaded
perhaps
in
these
politic
days
than
if
charlemagne
could
again
raise
the
oriflamme
surrounded
by
roland
and
all
his
paladins
louis
will
not
hazard
such
fields
as
those
of
cressy
of
poictiers
or
of
agincourt
with
a
thousand
lances
from
hainault
and
twenty
thousand
crowns
from
burgundy
edward
shall
risk
the
loss
of
england
while
he
is
engaged
in
a
protracted
struggle
for
the
recovery
of
normandy
and
guienne
but
what
are
the
movements
of
burgundy
he
has
menaced
germany
said
margaret
and
his
troops
are
now
employed
in
overrunning
lorraine
of
which
he
has
seized
the
principal
towns
and
castles
where
is
ferrand
de
vaudemont
a
youth
it
is
said
of
courage
and
enterprise
and
claiming
lorraine
in
right
of
his
mother
yolande
of
anjou
the
sister
of
your
grace
fled
replied
the
queen
into
germany
or
helvetia
let
burgundy
beware
of
him
said
the
experienced
earl
for
should
the
disinherited
youth
obtain
confederates
in
germany
and
allies
among
the
hardy
swiss
charles
of
burgundy
may
find
him
a
far
more
formidable
enemy
than
he
expects
we
are
strong
for
the
present
only
in
the
duke
strength
and
if
it
is
wasted
in
idle
and
desultory
efforts
our
hopes
alas
vanish
with
his
power
even
if
he
should
be
found
to
have
the
decided
will
to
assist
us
my
friends
in
england
are
resolute
not
to
stir
without
men
and
money
from
burgundy
it
is
a
fear
said
margaret
but
not
our
worst
fear
i
dread
more
the
policy
of
louis
who
unless
my
espials
have
grossly
deceived
me
has
even
already
proposed
a
secret
peace
to
edward
offering
with
large
sums
of
money
to
purchase
england
to
the
yorkists
and
a
truce
of
seven
years
it
can
not
be
said
oxford
no
englishman
commanding
such
an
army
as
edward
must
now
lead
dares
for
very
shame
to
retire
from
france
without
a
manly
attempt
to
recover
his
lost
provinces
such
would
have
been
the
thoughts
of
a
rightful
prince
said
margaret
who
left
behind
him
an
obedient
and
faithful
kingdom
such
may
not
be
the
thoughts
of
this
edward
misnamed
plantagenet
base
perhaps
in
mind
as
in
blood
since
they
say
his
real
father
was
one
blackburn
an
archer
of
middleham
usurper
at
least
if
not
bastard
such
will
not
be
his
thoughts
every
breeze
that
blows
from
england
will
bring
with
it
apprehensions
of
defection
amongst
those
over
whom
he
has
usurped
authority
he
will
not
sleep
in
peace
till
he
returns
to
england
with
those
whom
he
relies
upon
for
the
defence
of
his
stolen
crown
he
will
engage
in
no
war
with
louis
for
louis
will
not
hesitate
to
soothe
his
pride
by
humiliation
to
gorge
his
avarice
and
pamper
his
voluptuous
prodigality
by
sums
of
gold
and
i
fear
much
we
shall
soon
hear
of
the
english
army
retiring
from
france
with
the
idle
boast
that
they
have
displayed
their
banners
once
more
for
a
week
or
two
in
the
provinces
which
were
formerly
their
own
it
the
more
becomes
us
to
be
speedy
in
moving
burgundy
to
decision
replied
oxford
and
for
that
purpose
i
post
to
dijon
such
an
army
as
edward
can
not
be
transported
over
the
narrow
seas
in
several
weeks
the
probability
is
that
they
must
winter
in
france
even
if
they
should
have
truce
with
king
louis
with
a
thousand
hainault
lances
from
the
eastern
part
of
flanders
i
can
be
soon
in
the
north
where
we
have
many
friends
besides
the
assurance
of
help
from
scotland
the
faithful
west
will
rise
at
a
signal
a
clifford
can
be
found
though
the
mountain
mists
have
hid
him
from
richard
researches
the
welsh
will
assemble
at
the
rallying
word
of
tudor
the
red
rose
raises
its
head
once
more
and
so
god
save
king
henry
alas
said
the
queen
but
no
husband
no
friend
of
mine
the
son
but
of
my

a
welsh
chieftain
cold
they
say
and
crafty
but
be
it
so
let
me
only
see
lancaster
triumph
and
obtain
revenge
upon
york
and
i
will
die
contented
it
is
then
your
pleasure
that
i
should
make
the
proffers
expressed
by
your
grace
former
mandates
to
induce
burgundy
to
stir
himself
in
our
cause
if
he
learns
the
proposal
of
a
truce
betwixt
france
and
england
it
will
sting
sharper
than
aught
i
can
say
promise
all
however
said
the
queen
i
know
his
inmost
soul
it
is
set
upon
extending
the
dominions
of
his
house
in
every
direction
for
this
he
has
seized
gueldres
for
this
he
now
overruns
and
occupies
lorraine
for
this
he
covets
such
poor
remnants
of
provence
as
my
father
still
calls
his
own

such
augmented
territories
he
proposes
to
exchange
his
ducal
diadem
for
an
arched
crown
of
independent
sovereignty
tell
the

assist
his

tell
him
that
my

disown
the
opposition
made
to

he
shall
do

he
shall
declare
charles

my
ample
consent
tell
him
the
old

shall
cede
his

to
him
upon
the
instant
that
his
hainaulters
embark
for

small
pension
deducted
to

a

of

a

to
your

required
my

oh
no
no
exclaimed
the
dethroned
queen
touched
by
perhaps
the
only
tender
feeling
which
repeated
and
extraordinary
misfortunes
had
not
chilled
into
insensibility
hazard
not
the
life
of
the
noble
youth
he
that
is
the
last
of
the
loyal
and
faithful
house

he
that
should
have

the

in

of
my
beloved
edward
he
that
had
so
nearly
been
his
companion
in
a
bloody
and
untimely
grave
do
not
involve
this
poor
child
in
these
fatal
intrigues
which
have
been
so
baneful
to
his
family
let
him
go
with
me
him
at

i
will
shelter
from
danger
whilst
i
live
and
provide
for
when
i

no

forgive
me
madam
said
oxford
with
the
firmness
which
distinguished
him
my
son
as
you
deign
to
recollect
is
a
de

destined
perhaps
to
be
the
last
of
his
name
fall
he
may
but
it
must
not
be
without
honour
to
whatever
dangers
his
duty
and
allegiance
call
him
be
it
from
sword
or
lance
axe
or
gibbet
to
these
he
must
expose
himself
frankly
when
his
doing
so
can
mark
his
allegiance
his
ancestors
have
shown
him
how
to
brave
them
all
true

exclaimed
the
unfortunate
queen
raising
her
arms
wildly
all
must
perish
all
that
have
honoured
lancaster
all
that
have
loved
margaret
or
whom
she
has
loved
the
destruction
must
be
universal
the
young
must
fall
with
the
old
not
a

of
the
scattered
flock
shall
escape
for

sake
gracious
madam
said
oxford
compose
yourself
i
hear
them
knock
on
the
chapel
door
it
is
the
signal
of
parting
said
the
exiled
queen
collecting
herself
do
not
fear
noble
oxford
i
am
not
often
thus
but
how
seldom
do
i
see
those
friends
whose
faces
and
voices
can
disturb
the
composure
of
my
despair
let
me
tie
this
relic
about
thy
neck
good
youth
and
fear
not
its
evil
influence
though
you
receive
it
from
an
hand
it
was
my
husband
blessed
by
many
a
prayer
and
sanctified
by
many
a
holy
tear
even
my
unhappy
hands
can
not
pollute
it
i
should
have
bound
it
on
my
edward
bosom
on
the
dreadful
morning
of
tewkesbury
fight
but
he
armed
early
went
to
the
field
without
seeing
me
and
all
my
purpose
was
vain
she
passed
a
golden
chain
round
arthur
neck
as
she
spoke
which
contained
a
small
gold
crucifix
of
rich
but
barbarous
manufacture
it
had
belonged
said
tradition
to
edward
the
confessor
the
knock
at
the
door
of
the
chapel
was
repeated
we
must
not
tarry
said
margaret
let
us
part
here
you
for
dijon
i
to
aix
my
abode
of
unrest
in
provence
farewell
we
may
meet
in
a
better
hour
yet
how
can
i
hope
it
thus
i
said
on
the
morning
before
the
fight
of
albans
thus
on
the
dark
dawning
of
towton
thus
on
the
yet
more
bloody
field
of
tewkesbury
and
what
was
the
event
yet
hope
is
a
plant
which
can
not
be
rooted
out
of
a
noble
breast
till
the
last
crack
as
it
is
pulled
away
so
saying
she
passed
through
the
chapel
door
and
mingled
in
the
miscellaneous
assemblage
of
personages
who
worshipped
or
indulged
their
curiosity
or
consumed
their
idle
hours
amongst
the
aisles
of
the
cathedral
philipson
and
his
son
both
deeply
impressed
with
the
singular
interview
which
had
just
taken
place
returned
to
their
inn
where
they
found
a
pursuivant
with
the
duke
of
burgundy
badge
and
livery
who
informed
them
that
if
they
were
the
english
merchants
who
were
carrying
wares
of
value
to
the
court
of
the
duke
he
had
orders
to
afford
them
the
countenance
of
his
escort
and
inviolable
character
under
his
protection
they
set
out
from
strasburg
but
such
was
the
uncertainty
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
motions
and
such
the
numerous
obstacles
which
occurred
to
interrupt
their
journey
in
a
country
disturbed
by
the
constant
passage
of
troops
and
preparation
for
war
that
it
was
evening
on
the
second
day
ere
they
reached
the
plain
near
dijon
on
which
the
whole
or
great
part
of
his
power
lay
encamped

of

wherever
a
similar
reference
occurs
the
reader
will
understand
that
the

direction
applies
the
lancastrian
party
threw
the
imputation
of
bastardy
which
was
totally
unfounded
upon
edward
iv
chapter
vii
thus
said
the
duke
thus
did
the
duke
infer
the
eyes
of
the
elder
traveller
were
well
accustomed
to
sights
of
martial
splendour
yet
even
he
was
dazzled
with
the
rich
and
glorious
display
of
the
burgundian
camp
in
which
near
the
walls
of
dijon
charles
the
wealthiest
prince
in
europe
had
displayed
his
own
extravagance
and
encouraged
his
followers
to
similar
profusion
the
pavilions
of
the
meanest
officers
were
of
silk
and
samite
while
those
of
the
nobility
and
great
leaders
glittered
with
cloth
of
silver
cloth
of
gold
variegated
tapestry
and
other
precious
materials
which
in
no
other
situation
would
have
been
employed
as
a
cover
from
the
weather
but
would
themselves
have
been
thought
worthy
of
the
most
careful
protection
the
horsemen
and
infantry
who
mounted
guard
were
arrayed
in
the
richest
and
most
gorgeous
armour
a
beautiful
and
very
numerous
train
of
artillery
was
drawn
up
near
the
entrance
of
the
camp
and
in
its
commander
philipson
to
give
the
earl
the
travelling
name
to
which
our
readers
are
accustomed
recognised
henry
colvin
an
englishman
of
inferior
birth
but
distinguished
for
his
skill
in
conducting
these
terrible
engines
which
had
of
late
come
into
general
use
in
war
the
banners
and
pennons
which
were
displayed
by
every
knight
baron
and
man
of
rank
floated
before
their
tents
and
the
owners
of
these
transitory
dwellings
sat
at
the
door
and
enjoyed
the
military
contests
of
the
soldiers
in
wrestling
pitching
the
bar
and
other
athletic
exercises
long
rows
of
the
noblest
horses
were
seen
at
picket
prancing
and
tossing
their
heads
as
impatient
of
the
inactivity
to
which
they
were
confined
or
were
heard
neighing
over
the
provender
which
was
spread
plentifully
before
them
the
soldiers
formed
joyous
groups
around
the
minstrels
and
strolling
jugglers
or
were
engaged
in
at
the
sutlers
tents
others
strolled
about
with
folded
arms
casting
their
eyes
now
and
then
to
the
sinking
sun
as
if
desirous
that
the
hour
should
arrive
which
should
put
an
end
to
a
day
unoccupied
and
therefore
tedious
at
length
the
travellers
reached
amidst
the
dazzling
varieties
of
this
military
display
the
pavilion
of
the
duke
himself
before
which
floated
heavily
in
the
evening
breeze
the
broad
and
rich
banner
in
which
glowed
the
armorial
bearings
and
quarterings
of
a
prince
duke
of
six
provinces
and
count
of
fifteen
counties
who
was
from
his
power
his
disposition
and
the
success
which
seemed
to
attend
his
enterprises
the
general
dread
of
europe
the
pursuivant
made
himself
known
to
some
of
the
household
and
the
englishmen
were
immediately
received
with
courtesy
though
not
such
as
to
draw
attention
upon
them
and
conveyed
to
a
neighbouring
tent
the
residence
of
a
general
officer
which
they
were
given
to
understand
was
destined
for
their
accommodation
and
where
their
packages
accordingly
were
deposited
and
refreshments
offered
them
as
the
camp
is
filled
said
the
domestic
who
waited
upon
them
with
soldiers
of
different
nations
and
uncertain
dispositions
the
duke
of
burgundy
for
the
safety
of
your
merchandise
has
ordered
you
the
protection
of
a
regular
sentinel
in
the
meantime
be
in
readiness
to
wait
on
his
highness
seeing
you
may
look
to
be
presently
sent
for
accordingly
the
elder
philipson
was
shortly
after
summoned
to
the
duke
presence
introduced
by
a
back
entrance
into
the
ducal
pavilion
and
into
that
part
of
it
which
screened
by
close
curtains
and
wooden
barricades
formed
charles
own
separate
apartment
the
plainness
of
the
furniture
and
the
coarse
apparatus
of
the
toilette
formed
a
strong
contrast
to
the
appearance
of
the
exterior
of
the
pavilion
for
charles
whose
character
was
in
that
as
in
other
things
far
from
consistent
exhibited
in
his
own
person
during
war
an
austerity
or
rather
coarseness
of
dress
and
sometimes
of
manners
also
which
was
more
like
the
rudeness
of
a
german
lanzknecht
than
the
bearing
of
a
prince
of
exalted
rank
while
at
the
same
time
he
encouraged
and
enjoined
a
great
splendour
of
expense
and
display
amongst
his
vassals
and
courtiers
as
if
to
be
rudely
attired
and
to
despise
every
restraint
even
of
ordinary
ceremony
were
a
privilege
of
the
sovereign
alone
yet
when
it
pleased
him
to
assume
state
in
person
and
manners
none
knew
better
than
charles
of
burgundy
how
he
ought
to
adorn
and
demean
himself
upon
his
toilette
appeared
brushes
and
combs
which
might
have
claimed
dismissal
as
past
the
term
of
service
hats
and
doublets
and
other
such
paltry
articles
amongst
which
lay
at
random
as
it
seemed
the
great
diamond
called
sanci
the
three
rubies
termed
the
three
brothers
of
antwerp
another
great
diamond
called
the
lamp
of
flanders
and
other
precious
stones
of
scarcely
inferior
value
and
rarity
this
extraordinary
display
somewhat
resembled
the
character
of
the
duke
himself
who
mixed
cruelty
with
justice
magnanimity
with
meanness
of
spirit
economy
with
extravagance
and
liberality
with
avarice
being
in
fact
consistent
in
nothing
excepting
in
his
obstinate
determination
to
follow
the
opinion
he
had
once
formed
in
every
situation
of
things
and
through
all
variety
of
risks
in
the
midst
of
the
valueless
and
inestimable
articles
of
his
wardrobe
and
toilette
the
duke
of
burgundy
called
out
to
the
english
traveller
welcome
herr
philipson
welcome
you
of
a
nation
whose
traders
are
princes
and
their
merchants
the
mighty
ones
of
the
earth
what
new
commodities
have
you
brought
to
gull
us
with
you
merchants
by
george
are
a
wily
generation
faith
no
new
merchandise
i
my
lord
answered
the
elder
englishman
i
bring
but
the
commodities
which
i
showed
your
highness
the
last
time
i
communicated
with
you
in
the
hope
of
a
poor
trader
that
your
grace
may
find
them
more
acceptable
upon
a
review
than
when
you
first
saw
them
it
is
well
sir
philipville
i
think
they
call
you
you
are
a
simple
trader
or
you
take
me
for
a
silly
purchaser
that
you
think
to
gull
me
with
the
same
wares
which
i
fancied
not
formerly
change
of
fashion
man
novelty
is
the
motto
of
commerce
your
lancaster
wares
have
had
their
day
and
i
have
bought
of
them
like
others
and
was
like
enough
to
have
paid
dear
for
them
too
york
is
all
the
vogue
now
it
may
be
so
among
the
vulgar
said
the
earl
of
oxford
but
for
souls
like
your
highness
faith
honour
and
loyalty
are
jewels
which
change
of
fancy
or
mutability
of
taste
can
not
put
out
of
fashion
why
it
may
be
noble
oxford
said
the
duke
that
i
preserve
in
my
secret
mind
some
veneration
for
these
qualities
else
why
should
i
have
such
regard
for
your
person
in
which
they
have
ever
been
distinguished
but
my
situation
is
painfully
urgent
and
should
i
make
a
false
step
at
this
crisis
i
might
break
the
purposes
of
my
whole
life
observe
me
sir
merchant
here
has
come
over
your
old
competitor
blackburn
whom
some
call
edward
of
york
and
of
london
with
a
commodity
of
bows
and
bills
such
as
never
entered
france
since
king
arthur
time
and
he
offers
to
enter
into
joint
adventure
with
me
or
in
plain
speech
to
make
common
cause
with
burgundy
till
we
smoke
out
of
his
earths
the
old
fox
louis
and
nail
his
hide
to
the
in
a
word
england
invites
me
to
take
part
with
him
against
my
most
wily
and
inveterate
enemy
the
king
of
france
to
rid
myself
of
the
chain
of
vassalage
and
to
ascend
into
the
rank
of
independent
princes
how
think
you
noble
earl
can
i
forego
this
seducing
temptation
you
must
ask
this
of
some
of
your
counsellors
of
burgundy
said
oxford
it
is
a
question
fraught
too
deeply
with
ruin
to
my
cause
for
me
to
give
a
fair
opinion
on
it
nevertheless
said
charles
i
ask
thee
as
an
honourable
man
what
objections
you
see
to
the
course
proposed
to
me
speak
your
mind
and
speak
it
freely
my
lord
i
know
it
is
in
your
highness
nature
to
entertain
no
doubts
of
the
facility
of
executing
anything
which
you
have
once
determined
shall
be
done
yet
though
this
disposition
may
in
some
cases
prepare
for
its
own
success
and
has
often
done
so
there
are
others
in
which
persisting
in
our
purpose
merely
because
we
have
once
willed
it
leads
not
to
success
but
to
ruin
look
therefore
at
this
english
army
winter
is
approaching
where
are
they
to
be
lodged
how
are
they
to
be
victualled
by
whom
are
they
to
be
paid
is
your
highness
to
take
all
the
expense
and
labour
of
fitting
them
for
the
summer
campaign
for
rely
on
it
an
english
army
never
was
nor
will
be
fit
for
service
till
they
have
been
out
of
their
own
island
long
enough
to
accustom
them
to
military
duty
they
are
men
i
grant
the
fittest
for
soldiers
in
the
world
but
they
are
not
soldiers
as
yet
and
must
be
trained
to
become
such
at
your
highness
expense
be
it
so
said
charles
i
think
the
low
countries
can
find
food
for
the
knaves
for
a
few
weeks
and
villages
for
them
to
lie
in
and
officers
to
train
their
sturdy
limbs
to
war
and
enough
to
reduce
their
refractory
spirit
to
discipline
what
happens
next
said
oxford
you
march
to
paris
add
to
usurped
power
another
kingdom
restore
to
him
all
the
possessions
which
england
ever
had
in
france
normandy
maine
anjou
gascony
and
all
besides
can
you
trust
this
edward
when
you
shall
have
thus
fostered
his
strength
and
made
him
far
stronger
than
this
louis
whom
you
have
united
to
pull
down
by
george
i
will
not
dissemble
with
you
it
is
in
that
very
point
that
my
doubts
trouble
me
edward
is
indeed
my
but
i
am
a
man
little
inclined
to
put
my
head
under
my
wife
girdle
and
the
times
said
philipson
have
too
often
shown
the
inefficiency
of
family
alliances
to
prevent
the
most
gross
breaches
of
faith
you
say
well
earl
clarence
betrayed
his
louis
poisoned
his
brother
domestic
affections
pshaw
they
sit
warm
enough
by
a
private
man
fireside
but
they
can
not
come
into
fields
of
battle
or
princes
halls
where
the
wind
blows
cold
no
my
alliance
with
edward
by
marriage
were
little
succour
to
me
in
time
of
need
i
would
as
soon
ride
an
unbroken
horse
with
no
better
bridle
than
a
lady
garter
but
what
then
is
the
result
he
wars
on
louis
whichever
gains
the
better
i
who
must
be
strengthened
in
their
mutual
weakness
receive
the
advantage
the
englishmen
slay
the
french
with
their
shafts
and
the
frenchmen
by
skirmishes
waste
weaken
and
destroy
the
english
with
spring
i
take
the
field
with
an
army
superior
to
both
and
then
george
for
burgundy
and
if
in
the
meanwhile
your
highness
will
deign
to
assist
even
in
the
most
trifling
degree
a
cause
the
most
honourable
that
ever
knight
laid
lance
in
rest
for
a
moderate
sum
of
money
and
a
small
body
of
hainault
lances
who
may
gain
both
fame
and
fortune
by
the
service
may
replace
the
injured
heir
of
lancaster
in
the
possession
of
his
native
and
rightful
dominion
ay
marry
sir
earl
said
the
duke
you
come
roundly
to
the
point
but
we
have
seen
and
indeed
partly
assisted
at
so
many
turns
betwixt
york
and
lancaster
that
we
have
some
doubt
which
is
the
side
to
which
heaven
has
given
the
right
and
the
inclinations
of
the
people
the
effectual
power
we
are
surprised
into
absolute
giddiness
by
so
many
extraordinary
revolutions
of
fortune
as
england
has
exhibited
a
proof
my
lord
that
these
mutations
are
not
yet
ended
and
that
your
generous
aid
may
give
to
the
better
side
an
effectual
turn
of
advantage
and
lend
my
cousin
margaret
of
anjou
my
arm
to
dethrone
my
brother
perhaps
he
deserves
small
at
my
hands
since
he
and
his
insolent
nobles
have
been
urging
me
with
remonstrances
and
even
threats
to
lay
aside
all
my
own
important
affairs
and
join
edward
forsooth
in
his
expedition
against
louis
i
will
march
against
louis
at
my
own
time
and
not
sooner
and
by
george
neither
island
king
nor
island
noble
shall
dictate
to
charles
of
burgundy
you
are
fine
conceited
companions
you
english
of
both
sides
that
think
the
matters
of
your
own
bedlam
island
are
as
interesting
to
all
the
world
as
to
yourselves
but
neither
york
nor
lancaster
neither
brother
blackburn
nor
cousin
margaret
of
anjou
not
with
john
de
vere
to
back
her
shall
gull
me
men
lure
no
hawks
with
empty
hands
oxford
familiar
with
the
duke
disposition
suffered
him
to
exhaust
himself
in
chafing
that
any
one
should
pretend
to
dictate
his
course
of
conduct
and
when
he
was
at
length
silent
replied
with
calmness
do
i
live
to
hear
the
noble
duke
of
burgundy
the
mirror
of
european
chivalry
say
that
no
reason
has
been
shown
to
him
for
an
adventure
where
a
helpless
queen
is
to
be
redressed
a
royal
house
raised
from
the
dust
is
there
not
immortal
and
honour
the
trumpet
of
fame
to
proclaim
the
sovereign
who
alone
in
a
degenerate
age
has
united
the
duties
of
a
generous
knight
with
those
of
a
princely
sovereign
the
duke
interrupted
him
striking
him
at
the
same
time
on
the
shoulder
and
king
rené
five
hundred
fiddlers
to
tune
their
cracked
violins
in
my
praise
and
king
rené
himself
to
listen
to
them
and
say
fought
duke
well
played
fiddler
i
tell
thee
john
of
oxford
when
thou
and
i
wore
maiden
armour
such
words
as
fame
honour
knightly
glory
lady
love
and
so
forth
were
good
mottoes
for
our
shields
and
a
fair
enough
argument
for
splintering
lances
ay
and
in
though
somewhat
old
for
these
fierce
follies
i
would
jeopard
my
person
in
such
a
quarrel
yet
as
becomes
a
knight
of
the
order
but
when
we
come
to
paying
down
of
crowns
and
embarking
of
large
squadrons
we
must
have
to
propose
to
our
subjects
some
substantial
excuse
for
plunging
them
in
war
some
proposal
for
the
public
good
or
by
george
for
our
own
private
advantage
which
is
the
same
thing
this
is
the
course
the
world
runs
and
oxford
to
tell
the
plain
truth
i
mean
to
hold
the
same
bias
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
expect
your
highness
to
act
otherwise
than
with
a
view
to
your
subjects
welfare
the
increase
that
is
as
your
grace
happily
expresses
it
of
your
own
power
and
dominion
the
money
we
require
is
not
in
benevolence
but
in
loan
and
margaret
is
willing
to
deposit
these
jewels
of
which
i
think
your
grace
knows
the
value
till
she
shall
repay
the
sum
which
your
friendship
may
advance
in
her
necessity
ha
ha
said
the
duke
would
our
cousin
make
a
pawnbroker
of
us
and
have
us
deal
with
her
like
a
jewish
usurer
with
his
debtor
yet
in
faith
oxford
we
may
need
the
diamonds
for
if
this
business
were
otherwise
feasible
it
is
possible
that
i
myself
must
become
a
borrower
to
aid
my
cousin
necessities
i
have
applied
to
the
states
of
the
duchy
who
are
now
sitting
and
expect
as
is
reasonable
a
large
supply
but
there
are
restless
heads
and
close
hands
among
them
and
they
may
be
niggardly
so
place
the
jewels
on
the
table
in
the
well
say
i
am
to
be
no
sufferer
in
purse
by
this
feat
of
which
you
propose
to
me
still
princes
enter
not
into
war
without
some
view
of
advantage
listen
to
me
noble
sovereign
you
are
naturally
bent
to
unite
the
great
estates
of
your
father
and
those
you
have
acquired
by
your
own
arms
into
a
compact
and
firm
dukedom
call
it
kingdom
said
charles
it
is
the
worthier
word
into
a
kingdom
of
which
the
crown
shall
sit
as
fair
and
even
on
your
grace
brow
as
that
of
france
on
your
present
suzerain
louis
it
need
not
such
shrewdness
as
yours
to
descry
that
such
is
my
purpose
said
the
duke
else
wherefore
am
i
here
with
helm
on
my
head
and
sword
by
my
side
and
wherefore
are
my
troops
seizing
on
the
strong
places
in
lorraine
and
chasing
before
them
the
beggarly
de
vaudemont
who
has
the
insolence
to
claim
it
as
his
inheritance
yes
my
friend
the
aggrandisement
of
burgundy
is
a
theme
for
which
the
duke
of
that
fair
province
is
bound
to
fight
while
he
can
put
foot
in
stirrup
but
think
you
not
said
the
english
earl
since
you
allow
me
to
speak
freely
with
your
grace
on
the
footing
of
old
acquaintanceship
think
you
not
that
in
this
chart
of
your
dominions
otherwise
so
fairly
bounded
there
is
something
on
the
southern
frontier
which
might
be
arranged
more
advantageously
for
a
king
of
burgundy
i
can
not
guess
whither
you
would
lead
me
said
the
duke
looking
at
a
map
of
the
duchy
and
his
other
possessions
to
which
the
englishman
had
pointed
his
attention
and
then
turning
his
broad
keen
eye
upon
the
face
of
the
banished
earl
i
would
say
replied
the
latter
that
to
so
powerful
a
prince
as
your
grace
there
is
no
safe
neighbour
but
the
sea
here
is
provence
which
interferes
betwixt
you
and
the
mediterranean
provence
with
its
princely
harbours
and
fertile
cornfields
and
vineyards
were
it
not
well
to
include
it
in
your
map
of
sovereignty
and
thus
touch
the
middle
sea
with
one
hand
while
the
other
rested
on
the
of
flanders
provence
said
you
replied
the
duke
eagerly
why
man
my
very
dreams
are
of
provence
i
can
not
smell
an
orange
but
it
reminds
me
of
its
perfumed
woods
and
bowers
its
olives
citrons
and
pomegranates
but
how
to
frame
pretensions
to
it
shame
it
were
to
disturb
rené
the
harmless
old
man
nor
would
it
become
a
near
relation
then
he
is
the
uncle
of
louis
and
most
probably
failing
his
daughter
margaret
or
perhaps
in
preference
to
her
he
hath
named
the
french
king
his
heir
a
better
claim
might
be
raised
up
in
your
grace
own
person
said
the
earl
of
oxford
if
you
will
afford
margaret
of
anjou
the
succour
she
requires
by
me
take
the
aid
thou
requirest
replied
the
duke
take
double
the
amount
of
it
in
men
and
money
let
me
but
have
a
claim
upon
provence
though
thin
as
a
single
thread
of
thy
queen
margaret
hair
and
let
me
alone
for
twisting
it
into
the
tough
texture
of
a
quadruple
but
i
am
a
fool
to
listen
to
the
dreams
of
one
who
ruined
himself
can
lose
little
by
holding
forth
to
others
the
most
extravagant
hopes
charles
breathed
high
and
changed
complexion
as
he
spoke
i
am
not
such
a
person
my
lord
duke
said
the
earl
listen
to
me
rené
is
broken
with
years
fond
of
repose
and
too
poor
to
maintain
his
rank
with
the
necessary
dignity
too
or
too
to
lay
further
imposts
on
his
subjects
weary
of
contending
with
bad
fortune
and
desirous
to
resign
his
territories
his
territories
said
charles
yes
all
he
actually
possesses
and
the
much
more
extensive
dominions
which
he
has
claim
to
but
which
have
passed
from
his
sway
you
take
away
my
breath
said
the
duke
rené
resign
provence
and
what
says
margaret
the
proud
the
margaret
will
she
subscribe
to
so
humiliating
a
proceeding
for
the
chance
of
seeing
lancaster
triumph
in
england
she
would
resign
not
only
dominion
but
life
itself
and
in
truth
the
sacrifice
is
less
than
it
may
seem
to
be
it
is
certain
that
when
rené
dies
the
king
of
france
will
claim
the
old
man
county
of
provence
as
a
male
fief
and
there
is
no
one
strong
enough
to
back
margaret
claim
of
inheritance
however
just
it
may
be
it
is
just
said
charles
it
is
undeniable
i
will
not
hear
of
its
being
denied
or
challenged
that
is
when
once
it
is
established
in
our
own
person
it
is
the
true
principle
of
the
war
for
the
public
good
that
none
of
the
great
fiefs
be
suffered
to
revert
again
to
the
crown
of
france
least
of
all
while
it
stands
on
a
brow
so
astucious
and
unprincipled
as
that
of
louis
burgundy
joined
to
provence
a
dominion
from
the
german
ocean
to
the
mediterranean
oxford
thou
art
my
better
angel
your
grace
must
however
reflect
said
oxford
that
honourable
provision
must
be
made
for
king
rené
certainly
man
certainly
he
shall
have
a
score
of
fiddlers
and
jugglers
to
play
roar
and
recite
to
him
from
morning
till
night
he
shall
have
a
court
of
troubadours
who
shall
do
nothing
but
drink
flute
and
fiddle
to
him
and
pronounce
of
to
be
confirmed
or
reversed
by
an
appeal
to
himself
the
supreme
and
margaret
shall
also
be
honourably
sustained
in
the
manner
you
may
point
out
that
will
be
easily
settled
answered
the
english
earl
if
our
attempts
on
england
succeed
she
will
need
no
aid
from
burgundy
if
she
fails
she
retires
into
a
cloister
and
it
will
not
be
long
that
she
will
need
the
honourable
maintenance
which
i
am
sure
your
grace
generosity
will
willingly
assign
her
unquestionably
answered
charles
and
on
a
scale
which
will
become
us
both
but
by
my
halidome
john
of
vere
the
abbess
into
whose
cloister
margaret
of
anjou
shall
retire
will
have
an
ungovernable
penitent
under
her
charge
well
do
i
know
her
and
sir
earl
i
will
not
clog
our
discourse
by
expressing
any
doubts
that
if
she
pleases
she
can
compel
her
father
to
resign
his
estates
to
whomsoever
she
will
she
is
like
my
brache
gorgon
who
compels
whatsoever
hound
is
coupled
with
her
to
go
the
way
she
chooses
or
she
strangles
him
if
he
resists
so
has
margaret
acted
with
her
husband
and
i
am
aware
that
her
father
a
fool
of
a
different
cast
must
of
necessity
be
equally
tractable
i
think
could
have
matched
her
though
my
very
neck
aches
at
the
thought
of
the
struggles
we
should
have
had
for
but
you
look
grave
because
i
jest
with
the
pertinacious
temper
of
my
unhappy
cousin
my
lord
said
oxford
whatever
are
or
have
been
the
defects
of
my
mistress
she
is
in
distress
and
almost
in
desolation
she
is
my
sovereign
and
your
highness
cousin
not
the
less
enough
said
sir
earl
answered
the
duke
let
us
speak
seriously
whatever
we
may
think
of
the
abdication
of
king
rené
i
fear
we
shall
find
it
difficult
to
make
louis
xi
see
the
matter
as
favourably
as
we
do
he
will
hold
that
the
county
of
provence
is
a
male
fief
and
that
neither
the
resignation
of
rené
nor
the
consent
of
his
daughter
can
prevent
its
reverting
to
the
crown
of
france
as
the
king
of
sicily
as
they
call
him
hath
no
male
issue
that
may
it
please
your
grace
is
a
question
for
battle
to
decide
and
your
highness
has
successfully
braved
louis
for
a
less
important
stake
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
your
grace
active
assistance
enables
the
young
earl
of
richmond
to
succeed
in
his
enterprise
you
shall
have
the
aid
of
three
thousand
english
archers
if
old
john
of
oxford
for
want
of
a
better
leader
were
to
bring
them
over
himself
a
noble
aid
said
the
duke
graced
still
more
by
him
who
promises
to
lead
them
thy
succour
noble
oxford
were
precious
to
me
did
you
but
come
with
your
sword
by
your
side
and
a
single
page
at
your
back
i
know
you
well
both
heart
and
head
but
let
us
to
this
gear
exiles
even
the
wisest
are
privileged
in
promises
and
sometimes
excuse
me
noble
oxford
impose
on
themselves
as
well
as
on
their
friends
what
are
the
hopes
on
which
you
desire
me
again
to
embark
on
so
troubled
and
uncertain
an
ocean
as
these
civil
contests
of
yours
the
earl
of
oxford
produced
a
schedule
and
explained
to
the
duke
the
plan
of
his
expedition
to
be
backed
by
an
insurrection
of
the
friends
of
lancaster
of
which
it
is
enough
to
say
that
it
was
bold
to
the
verge
of
temerity
but
yet
so
well
compacted
and
put
together
as
to
bear
in
those
times
of
rapid
revolution
and
under
a
leader
of
oxford
approved
military
skill
and
political
sagacity
a
strong
appearance
of
probable
success
while
duke
charles
mused
over
the
particulars
of
an
enterprise
attractive
and
congenial
to
his
own
disposition
while
he
counted
over
the
affronts
which
he
had
received
from
his
edward
the
present
opportunity
for
taking
a
signal
revenge
and
the
rich
acquisition
which
he
hoped
to
make
in
provence
by
the
cession
in
his
favour
of
rené
of
anjou
and
his
daughter
the
englishman
failed
not
to
press
on
his
consideration
the
urgent
necessity
of
suffering
no
time
to
escape
the
accomplishment
of
this
scheme
he
said
demands
the
utmost
promptitude
to
have
a
chance
of
success
i
must
be
in
england
with
your
grace
auxiliary
forces
before
edward
of
york
can
return
from
france
with
his
army
and
having
come
hither
said
the
duke
our
worthy
brother
will
be
in
no
hurry
to
return
again
he
will
meet
with
french
women
and
french
wine
and
brother
blackburn
is
no
man
to
leave
such
commodities
in
a
hurry
my
lord
duke
i
will
speak
truth
of
my
enemy
edward
is
indolent
and
luxurious
when
things
are
easy
around
him
but
let
him
feel
the
spur
of
necessity
and
he
becomes
as
eager
as
a
pampered
steed
louis
too
who
seldom
fails
in
finding
means
to
accomplish
his
ends
is
bent
upon
determining
the
english
king
to
recross
the
sea
therefore
speed
noble
prince
speed
is
the
soul
of
your
enterprise
speed
said
the
duke
of
burgundy
why
i
will
go
with
you
and
see
the
embarkation
myself
and
tried
approved
soldiers
you
shall
have
such
as
are
nowhere
to
be
found
save
in
artois
and
hainault
but
pardon
yet
noble
duke
the
impatience
of
a
drowning
wretch
urgently
pressing
for
when
shall
we
to
the
coast
of
flanders
to
order
this
important
measure
why
in
a
fortnight
or
perchance
a
week
or
in
a
word
so
soon
as
i
shall
have
chastised
to
purpose
a
certain
gang
of
thieves
and
robbers
who
as
the
scum
of
the
caldron
will
always
be
uppermost
have
got
up
into
the
fastnesses
of
the
alps
and
from
thence
annoy
our
frontiers
by
contraband
traffic
pillage
and
robbery
your
highness
means
the
swiss
confederates
ay
the
peasant
churls
give
themselves
such
a
name
they
are
a
sort
of
manumitted
slaves
of
austria
and
like
a
whose
chain
is
broken
they
avail
themselves
of
their
liberty
to
annoy
and
rend
whatever
comes
in
their
way
i
travelled
through
their
country
from
italy
said
the
exiled
earl
and
i
heard
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
cantons
to
send
envoys
to
solicit
peace
of
your
highness
peace
exclaimed
a
proper
sort
of
peaceful
proceedings
those
of
their
embassy
have
been
availing
themselves
of
a
mutiny
of
the
burghers
of
la
ferette
the
first
garrison
town
which
they
entered
they
stormed
the
walls
seized
on
archibald
de
hagenbach
who
commanded
the
place
on
my
part
and
put
him
to
death
in
the
such
an
insult
must
be
punished
sir
john
de
vere
and
if
you
do
not
see
me
in
the
storm
of
passion
which
it
well
deserves
it
is
because
i
have
already
given
orders
to
hang
up
the
base
runagates
who
call
themselves
ambassadors
for
god
sake
noble
duke
said
the
englishman
throwing
himself
at
charles
feet
for
your
own
character
for
the
sake
of
the
peace
of
christendom
revoke
such
an
order
if
it
is
really
given
what
means
this
passion
said
duke
what
are
these
lives
to
thee
excepting
that
the
consequences
of
a
war
may
delay
your
expedition
for
a
few
days
may
render
it
altogether
abortive
said
the
earl
nay
needs
do
hear
me
lord
duke
i
was
with
these
men
on
a
part
of
their
journey
you
said
the
duke
you
a
companion
of
the
paltry
swiss
peasants
misfortune
has
sunk
the
pride
of
english
nobility
to
a
low
ebb
when
you
selected
such
associates
i
was
thrown
amongst
them
by
accident
said
the
earl
some
of
them
are
of
noble
blood
and
are
besides
men
for
whose
peaceable
intentions
i
ventured
to
constitute
myself
their
warrant
on
my
honour
my
lord
of
oxford
you
graced
them
highly
and
me
no
less
in
interfering
between
the
swiss
and
myself
allow
me
to
say
that
i
condescend
when
in
deference
to
past
friendship
i
permit
you
to
speak
to
me
of
your
own
english
affairs
methinks
you
might
well
spare
me
your
opinion
upon
topics
with
which
you
have
no
natural
concern
my
lord
of
burgundy
replied
oxford
i
followed
your
banner
to
paris
and
had
the
good
luck
to
rescue
you
in
the
fight
at
mont
when
you
were
beset
by
the
french
we
have
not
forgot
it
said
duke
charles
and
it
is
a
sign
that
we
keep
the
action
in
remembrance
that
you
have
been
suffered
to
stand
before
us
so
long
pleading
the
cause
of
a
set
of
rascals
whom
we
are
required
to
spare
from
the
gallows
that
groans
for
them
because
forsooth
they
have
been
the
of
the
earl
of
oxford
not
so
my
lord
i
ask
their
lives
only
because
they
are
upon
a
peaceful
errand
and
the
leaders
amongst
them
at
least
have
no
accession
to
the
crime
of
which
you
complain
the
duke
traversed
the
apartment
with
unequal
steps
in
much
agitation
his
large
eyebrows
drawn
down
over
his
eyes
his
hands
clenched
and
his
teeth
set
until
at
length
he
seemed
to
take
a
resolution
he
rung
a
handbell
of
silver
which
stood
upon
his
table
here
contay
he
said
to
the
gentleman
of
his
chamber
who
entered
are
these
mountain
fellows
yet
executed
no
may
it
please
your
highness
but
the
executioner
waits
them
so
soon
as
the
priest
hath
confessed
them
let
them
live
said
the
duke
we
will
hear
in
what
manner
they
propose
to
justify
their
proceedings
towards
us
contay
bowed
and
left
the
apartment
then
turning
to
the
englishman
the
duke
said
with
an
indescribable
mixture
of
haughtiness
with
familiarity
and
even
kindness
but
having
his
brows
cleared
and
his
looks
composed
we
are
now
clear
of
obligation
my
lord
of
oxford
you
have
obtained
life
for
life
nay
to
make
up
some
inequality
which
there
may
be
betwixt
the
value
of
the
commodities
bestowed
you
have
obtained
six
lives
for
one
i
will
therefore
pay
no
more
attention
to
you
should
you
again
upbraid
me
with
the
stumbling
horse
at
mont
or
your
own
achievements
on
that
occasion
most
princes
are
contented
with
privately
hating
such
men
as
have
rendered
them
extraordinary
services
i
feel
no
such
disposition
i
only
detest
being
reminded
of
having
had
occasion
for
pshaw
i
am
half
choked
with
the
effort
of
foregoing
my
own
fixed
so
ho
who
waits
there
bring
me
to
drink
an
usher
entered
bearing
a
large
silver
flagon
which
instead
of
wine
was
filled
with
ptisan
slightly
flavoured
by
aromatic
herbs
i
am
so
hot
and
choleric
by
nature
said
the
duke
that
our
leeches
prohibit
me
from
drinking
wine
but
you
oxford
are
bound
by
no
such
regimen
get
thee
to
thy
countryman
colvin
the
general
of
our
artillery
we
commend
thee
to
his
custody
and
hospitality
till
which
must
be
a
busy
day
since
i
expect
to
receive
the
answer
of
these
wiseacres
of
the
dijon
assembly
of
estates
and
have
also
to
hear
thanks
to
your
lordship
interference
these
miserable
swiss
envoys
as
they
call
themselves
well
no
more
you
may
communicate
freely
with
colvin
who
is
like
yourself
an
old
but
hark
ye
not
a
word
respecting
provence
not
even
in
your
contay
conduct
this
english
gentleman
to
colvin
tent
he
knows
my
pleasure
respecting
him
so
please
your
grace
answered
contay
i
left
the
english
gentleman
son
with
monsieur
de
colvin
what
thine
own
son
oxford
and
with
thee
here
why
did
you
not
tell
me
of
him
is
he
a
true
scion
of
the
ancient
tree
it
is
my
pride
to
believe
so
my
lord
he
has
been
the
faithful
companion
of
all
my
dangers
and
wanderings
happy
man
said
the
duke
with
a
sigh
you
oxford
have
a
son
to
share
your
poverty
and
distress
i
have
none
to
be
partner
and
successor
to
my
greatness
you
have
a
daughter
my
lord
said
the
noble
de
vere
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
she
will
one
day
wed
some
powerful
prince
who
may
be
the
stay
of
your
highness
house
never
by
george
never
answered
the
duke
sharply
and
shortly
i
will
have
no
who
may
make
the
daughter
bed
a
to
reach
the
father
crown
oxford
i
have
spoken
more
freely
than
i
am
wont
perhaps
more
freely
than
i
ought
but
i
hold
some
men
trustworthy
and
believe
you
sir
john
de
vere
to
be
one
of
them
the
english
nobleman
bowed
and
was
about
to
leave
his
presence
but
the
duke
presently
recalled
him
there
is
one
thing
more
the
cession
of
provence
is
not
quite
enough
rené
and
margaret
must
disavow
this
ferrand
de
vaudemont
who
is
making
some
foolish
stir
in
lorraine
in
right
of
his
mother
yolande
my
lord
said
oxford
ferrand
is
the
grandson
of
king
rené
the
nephew
of
queen
margaret
but
yet
but
yet
by
george
his
rights
as
he
calls
them
on
lorraine
must
positively
be
disowned
you
talk
of
their
family
feelings
while
you
are
urging
me
to
make
war
on
my
own
rené
best
apology
for
deserting
his
grandson
answered
oxford
will
be
his
total
inability
to
support
and
assist
him
i
will
communicate
your
grace
condition
though
it
is
a
hard
one
so
saying
he
left
the
pavilion
chapter
viii
i
humbly
thank
your
highness
and
am
right
glad
to
catch
this
good
occasion
most
thoroughly
to
be
winnow
where
my
chaff
and
corn
shall
fly
asunder
henry
colvin
the
english
officer
to
whom
the
duke
of
burgundy
with
splendid
pay
and
appointments
committed
the
charge
of
his
artillery
was
owner
of
the
tent
assigned
for
the
englishman
lodging
and
received
the
earl
of
oxford
with
the
respect
due
to
his
rank
and
to
the
duke
especial
orders
upon
that
subject
he
had
been
himself
a
follower
of
the
lancaster
faction
and
of
course
was
well
disposed
towards
one
of
the
very
few
men
of
distinction
whom
he
had
known
personally
and
who
had
constantly
adhered
to
that
family
through
the
train
of
misfortunes
by
which
they
seemed
to
be
totally
overwhelmed
a
repast
of
which
his
son
had
already
partaken
was
offered
to
the
earl
by
colvin
who
omitted
not
to
recommend
by
precept
and
example
the
good
wine
of
burgundy
from
which
the
sovereign
of
the
province
was
himself
obliged
to
refrain
his
grace
shows
command
of
passion
in
that
said
colvin
for
sooth
to
speak
and
only
conversing
betwixt
friends
his
temper
grows
too
headlong
to
bear
the
spur
which
a
cup
of
cordial
beverage
gives
to
the
blood
and
he
therefore
wisely
restricts
himself
to
such
liquid
as
may
cool
rather
than
inflame
his
natural
fire
of
disposition
i
can
perceive
as
much
said
the
lancastrian
noble
when
i
first
knew
the
noble
duke
who
was
then
earl
of
charolois
his
temper
though
always
sufficiently
fiery
was
calmness
to
the
impetuosity
which
he
now
displays
on
the
smallest
contradiction
such
is
the
course
of
an
uninterrupted
flow
of
prosperity
he
has
ascended
by
his
own
courage
and
the
advantage
of
circumstances
from
the
doubtful
place
of
a
feudatory
and
tributary
prince
to
rank
with
the
most
powerful
sovereigns
in
europe
and
to
assume
independent
majesty
but
i
trust
the
noble
starts
of
generosity
which
atoned
for
his
wilful
and
wayward
temper
are
not
more
few
than
formerly
i
have
good
right
to
say
that
they
are
not
replied
the
soldier
of
fortune
who
understood
generosity
in
the
restricted
sense
of
liberality
the
duke
is
a
noble
and
master
i
trust
his
bounty
is
conferred
on
men
who
are
as
faithful
and
steady
in
their
service
as
you
colvin
have
ever
been
but
i
see
a
change
in
your
army
i
know
the
banners
of
most
of
the
old
houses
in
burgundy
how
is
it
that
i
observe
so
few
of
them
in
the
duke
camp
i
see
flags
and
pennons
and
pennoncelles
but
even
to
me
who
have
been
so
many
years
acquainted
with
the
nobility
both
of
france
and
flanders
their
bearings
are
unknown
my
noble
lord
of
oxford
answered
the
officer
it
ill
becomes
a
man
who
lives
on
the
duke
pay
to
censure
his
conduct
but
his
highness
hath
of
late
trusted
too
much
as
it
seems
to
me
to
the
hired
arms
of
foreign
levies
and
too
little
to
his
own
native
subjects
and
retainers
he
holds
it
better
to
take
into
his
pay
large
bands
of
german
and
italian
mercenary
soldiers
than
to
repose
confidence
in
the
knights
and
squires
who
are
bound
to
him
by
allegiance
and
feudal
faith
he
uses
the
aid
of
his
own
subjects
but
as
the
means
of
producing
him
sums
of
money
which
he
bestows
on
his
hired
troops
the
germans
are
honest
knaves
enough
while
regularly
paid
but
heaven
preserve
me
from
the
duke
italian
bands
and
that
their
leader
who
waits
but
the
highest
price
to
sell
his
highness
like
a
sheep
for
the
shambles
think
you
so
ill
of
him
demanded
the
earl
so
very
ill
indeed
that
i
believe
replied
colvin
there
is
no
sort
of
treachery
which
the
heart
can
devise
or
the
arm
perpetrate
that
hath
not
ready
reception
in
his
breast
and
prompt
execution
at
his
hand
it
is
painful
my
lord
for
an
honest
englishman
like
me
to
serve
in
an
army
where
such
traitors
have
command
but
what
can
i
do
unless
i
could
once
more
find
me
a
soldier
occupation
in
my
native
country
i
often
hope
it
will
please
merciful
heaven
again
to
awaken
those
brave
civil
wars
in
my
own
dear
england
where
all
was
fair
fighting
and
treason
was
unheard
of
lord
oxford
gave
his
host
to
understand
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
his
pious
wish
of
living
and
dying
in
his
own
country
and
in
the
practice
of
his
profession
was
not
to
be
despaired
of
meantime
he
requested
of
him
that
early
on
the
next
morning
he
would
procure
him
a
pass
and
an
escort
for
his
son
whom
he
was
compelled
to
despatch
forthwith
to
nancy
the
residence
of
king
rené
what
said
colvin
is
my
young
lord
of
oxford
to
take
a
degree
in
the
court
of
love
for
no
other
business
is
listened
to
at
king
capital
save
love
and
poetry
i
am
not
ambitious
of
such
distinction
for
him
my
good
host
answered
oxford
but
queen
margaret
is
with
her
father
and
it
is
but
fitting
that
the
youth
should
kiss
her
hand
enough
spoken
said
the
veteran
lancastrian
i
trust
though
winter
is
fast
approaching
the
red
rose
may
bloom
in
spring
he
then
ushered
the
earl
of
oxford
to
the
partition
of
the
tent
which
he
was
to
occupy
in
which
there
was
a
couch
for
arthur
also
their
host
as
colvin
might
be
termed
assuring
them
that
with
peep
of
day
horses
and
faithful
attendants
should
be
ready
to
speed
the
youth
on
his
journey
to
nancy
and
now
arthur
said
his
father
we
must
part
once
more
i
dare
give
thee
in
this
land
of
danger
no
written
communication
to
my
mistress
queen
margaret
but
say
to
her
that
i
have
found
the
duke
of
burgundy
wedded
to
his
own
views
of
interest
but
not
averse
to
combine
them
with
hers
say
that
i
have
little
doubt
that
he
will
grant
us
the
required
aid
but
not
without
the
expected
resignation
in
his
favour
by
herself
and
king
rené
say
i
would
never
have
recommended
such
a
sacrifice
for
the
precarious
chance
of
overthrowing
the
house
of
york
but
that
i
am
satisfied
that
france
and
burgundy
are
hanging
like
vultures
over
provence
and
that
the
one
or
other
or
both
princes
are
ready
on
her
father
demise
to
pounce
on
such
possessions
as
they
have
reluctantly
spared
to
him
during
his
life
an
accommodation
with
burgundy
may
therefore
on
the
one
hand
insure
his
active
in
the
attempt
on
england
and
on
the
other
if
our
princess
complies
not
with
the
duke
request
the
justice
of
her
cause
will
give
no
additional
security
to
her
hereditary
claims
on
her
father
dominions
bid
queen
margaret
therefore
unless
she
should
have
changed
her
views
obtain
king
rené
formal
deed
of
cession
conveying
his
estates
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
with
her
majesty
consent
the
necessary
provisions
to
the
king
and
to
herself
may
be
filled
up
at
her
grace
pleasure
or
they
may
be
left
blank
i
can
trust
to
the
duke
generosity
to
their
being
suitably
arranged
all
that
i
fear
is
that
charles
may
embroil
himself
in
some
silly
exploit
necessary
for
his
own
honour
and
the
safety
of
his
dominions
answered
a
voice
behind
the
lining
of
the
tent
and
by
doing
so
attend
to
his
own
affairs
more
than
to
ours
ha
sir
earl
at
the
same
time
the
curtain
was
drawn
aside
and
a
person
entered
in
whom
though
clothed
with
the
jerkin
and
bonnet
of
a
private
soldier
of
the
walloon
guard
oxford
instantly
recognised
the
duke
of
burgundy
harsh
features
and
fierce
eyes
as
they
sparkled
from
under
the
fur
and
feather
with
which
the
cap
was
ornamented
arthur
who
knew
not
the
prince
person
started
at
the
intrusion
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
dagger
but
his
father
made
a
signal
which
stayed
his
hand
and
he
gazed
with
wonder
on
the
solemn
respect
with
which
the
earl
received
the
intrusive
soldier
the
first
word
informed
him
of
the
cause
if
this
masking
be
done
in
proof
of
my
faith
noble
duke
permit
me
to
say
it
is
superfluous
nay
oxford
answered
the
duke
i
was
a
courteous
spy
for
i
ceased
to
play
the
eavesdropper
at
the
very
moment
when
i
had
reason
to
expect
you
were
about
to
say
something
to
anger
me
as
i
am
a
true
knight
my
lord
duke
if
you
had
remained
behind
the
arras
you
would
only
have
heard
the
same
truths
which
i
am
ready
to
tell
in
your
grace
presence
though
it
may
have
chanced
they
might
have
been
more
bluntly
expressed
well
speak
them
then
in
whatever
phrase
thou
wilt
they
lie
in
their
throats
that
say
charles
of
burgundy
was
ever
offended
by
advice
from
a
friend
i
would
then
have
said
replied
the
english
earl
that
all
which
margaret
of
anjou
had
to
apprehend
was
that
the
duke
of
burgundy
when
buckling
on
his
armour
to
win
provence
for
himself
and
to
afford
to
her
his
powerful
assistance
to
assert
her
rights
in
england
was
likely
to
be
withdrawn
from
such
high
objects
by
an
imprudently
eager
desire
to
avenge
himself
of
imaginary
affronts
offered
to
him
as
he
supposed
by
certain
confederacies
of
alpine
mountaineers
over
whom
it
is
impossible
to
gain
any
important
advantage
or
acquire
reputation
while
on
the
contrary
there
is
a
risk
of
losing
both
these
men
dwell
amongst
rocks
and
deserts
which
are
almost
inaccessible
and
subsist
in
a
manner
so
rude
that
the
poorest
of
your
subjects
would
starve
if
subjected
to
such
diet
they
are
formed
by
nature
to
be
the
garrison
of
the
in
which
she
has
placed
them
for
heaven
sake
meddle
not
with
them
but
follow
forth
your
own
nobler
and
more
important
objects
without
stirring
a
nest
of
hornets
which
once
in
motion
may
sting
you
into
madness
the
duke
had
promised
patience
and
endeavoured
to
keep
his
word
but
the
swoln
muscles
of
his
face
and
his
flashing
eyes
showed
how
painful
to
him
it
was
to
suppress
his
resentment
you
are
misinformed
my
lord
he
said
these
men
are
not
the
inoffensive
herdsmen
and
peasants
you
are
pleased
to
suppose
them
if
they
were
i
might
afford
to
despise
them
but
flushed
with
some
victories
over
the
sluggish
austrians
they
have
shaken
off
all
reverence
for
authority
assume
airs
of
independence
form
leagues
make
inroads
storm
towns
doom
and
execute
men
of
noble
birth
at
their
thou
art
dull
and
as
if
thou
dost
not
apprehend
me
to
rouse
thy
english
blood
and
make
thee
sympathise
with
my
feelings
to
these
mountaineers
know
that
these
swiss
are
very
scots
to
my
dominions
in
their
neighbourhood
poor
proud
ferocious
easily
offended
because
they
gain
by
war
ill
to
be
appeased
because
they
nourish
deep
revenge
ever
ready
to
seize
the
moment
of
advantage
and
attack
a
neighbour
when
he
is
engaged
in
other
affairs
the
same
unquiet
perfidious
and
inveterate
enemies
that
the
scots
are
to
england
are
the
swiss
to
burgundy
and
to
my
allies
what
say
you
can
i
undertake
anything
of
consequence
till
i
have
crushed
the
pride
of
such
a
people
it
will
be
but
a
few
days
work
i
will
grasp
the
prickles
and
all
with
my
your
grace
will
then
have
shorter
work
with
them
replied
the
disguised
nobleman
than
our
english
kings
have
had
with
scotland
the
wars
there
have
lasted
so
long
and
proved
so
bloody
that
wise
men
regret
we
ever
began
them
nay
said
the
duke
i
will
not
dishonour
the
scots
by
comparing
them
in
all
respects
to
these
of
the
cantons
the
scots
have
blood
and
gentry
among
them
and
we
have
seen
many
examples
of
both
these
swiss
are
a
mere
brood
of
peasants
and
the
few
gentlemen
of
birth
they
can
boast
must
hide
their
distinction
in
the
dress
and
manners
of
clowns
they
will
i
think
scarce
stand
against
a
charge
of
hainaulters
not
if
the
hainaulters
find
ground
to
ride
upon
but
nay
to
silence
your
scruples
said
the
duke
interrupting
him
know
that
these
people
encourage
by
their
countenance
and
aid
the
formation
of
the
most
dangerous
conspiracies
in
my
dominions
look
here
i
told
you
that
my
officer
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
was
murdered
when
the
town
of
brisach
was
treacherously
taken
by
these
harmless
switzers
of
yours
and
here
is
a
scroll
of
parchment
which
announces
that
my
servant
was
murdered
by
doom
of
the
a
band
of
secret
assassins
whom
i
will
not
permit
to
meet
in
any
part
of
my
dominions
oh
could
i
but
catch
them
above
ground
as
they
are
found
lurking
below
they
should
know
what
the
life
of
a
nobleman
is
worth
then
look
at
the
insolence
of
their
attestation
the
scroll
bore
with
the
day
and
date
adjected
that
judgment
had
been
done
on
archibald
de
hagenbach
for
tyranny
violence
and
oppression
by
order
of
the
holy
vehme
and
that
it
was
executed
by
their
officials
who
were
responsible
for
the
same
to
their
tribunal
alone
it
was
countersigned
in
red
ink
with
the
badges
of
the
secret
society
a
coil
of
ropes
and
a
drawn
dagger
this
document
i
found
stuck
to
my
toilette
with
a
knife
said
the
duke
another
trick
by
which
they
give
mystery
to
their
murderous
jugglery
the
thought
of
what
he
had
undergone
in
john
mengs
house
and
reflections
upon
the
extent
and
omnipresence
of
these
secret
associations
struck
even
the
brave
englishman
with
an
involuntary
shudder
for
the
sake
of
every
saint
in
heaven
he
said
forbear
my
lord
to
speak
of
these
tremendous
societies
whose
creatures
are
above
beneath
and
around
us
no
man
is
secure
of
his
life
however
guarded
if
it
be
sought
by
a
man
who
is
careless
of
his
own
you
are
surrounded
by
germans
italians
and
other
strangers
how
many
amongst
these
may
be
bound
by
the
secret
ties
which
withdraw
men
from
every
other
social
bond
to
unite
them
together
in
one
inextricable
though
secret
compact
beware
noble
prince
of
the
situation
on
which
your
throne
is
placed
though
it
still
exhibits
all
the
splendour
of
power
and
all
the
solidity
of
foundation
that
belongs
to
so
august
a
structure
i
the
friend
of
thy
house
were
it
with
my
dying
breath
must
needs
tell
thee
that
the
swiss
hang
like
an
avalanche
over
thy
head
and
the
secret
associations
work
beneath
thee
like
the
first
throes
of
the
coming
earthquake
provoke
not
the
contest
and
the
snow
will
rest
undisturbed
on
the
the
agitation
of
the
subterranean
vapours
will
be
hushed
to
rest
but
a
single
word
of
defiance
or
one
flash
of
indignant
scorn
may
call
their
terrors
into
instant
action
you
speak
said
the
duke
with
more
awe
of
a
pack
of
naked
churls
and
a
band
of
midnight
assassins
than
i
have
seen
you
show
for
real
danger
yet
i
will
not
scorn
your
counsel
i
will
hear
the
swiss
envoys
patiently
and
i
will
not
if
i
can
help
it
show
the
contempt
with
which
i
can
not
but
regard
their
pretensions
to
treat
as
independent
states
on
the
secret
associations
i
will
be
silent
till
time
gives
me
the
means
of
acting
in
combination
with
the
emperor
the
diet
and
the
princes
of
the
empire
that
they
may
be
driven
from
all
their
burrows
at
ha
sir
earl
said
i
well
it
is
well
thought
my
lord
but
it
may
be
unhappily
spoken
you
are
in
a
position
where
one
word
overheard
by
a
traitor
might
produce
death
and
ruin
i
keep
no
traitors
about
me
said
charles
if
i
thought
there
were
such
in
my
camp
i
would
rather
die
by
them
at
once
than
live
in
perpetual
terror
and
suspicion
your
highness
ancient
followers
and
servants
said
the
earl
speak
unfavourably
of
the
count
of
who
holds
so
high
a
rank
in
your
confidence
ay
replied
the
duke
with
composure
it
is
easy
to
decry
the
most
faithful
servant
in
a
court
by
the
unanimous
hatred
of
all
the
others
i
warrant
me
your
countryman
colvin
has
been
railing
against
the
count
like
the
rest
of
them
for
sees
nothing
amiss
in
any
department
but
he
reports
it
to
me
without
fear
or
favour
and
then
his
opinions
are
cast
so
much
in
the
same
mould
with
my
own
that
i
can
hardly
get
him
to
enlarge
upon
what
he
best
understands
if
it
seems
in
any
respect
different
from
my
sentiments
add
to
this
a
noble
person
grace
gaiety
skill
in
the
exercises
of
war
and
in
the
courtly
arts
of
peace
such
is
and
being
such
is
he
not
a
gem
for
a
prince
cabinet
the
very
materials
out
of
which
a
favourite
is
formed
answered
the
earl
of
oxford
but
something
less
adapted
for
making
a
faithful
counsellor
why
thou
mistrustful
fool
said
the
duke
must
i
tell
thee
the
very
inmost
secret
respecting
this
man
and
will
nothing
short
of
it
stay
these
imaginary
suspicions
which
thy
new
trade
of
an
itinerant
merchant
hath
led
thee
to
entertain
so
rashly
if
your
highness
honours
me
with
your
confidence
said
the
earl
of
oxford
i
can
only
say
that
my
fidelity
shall
deserve
it
know
then
thou
misbelieving
mortal
that
my
good
friend
and
brother
louis
of
france
sent
me
private
information
through
no
less
a
person
than
his
famous
barber
oliver
le
diable
that
had
for
a
certain
sum
offered
to
put
my
person
into
his
hands
alive
or
you
start
i
do
indeed
recollecting
your
highness
practice
of
riding
out
lightly
armed
and
with
a
very
small
attendance
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
and
visit
the
outposts
and
therefore
how
easily
such
a
treacherous
device
might
be
carried
into
execution
pshaw
answered
the
thou
seest
the
danger
as
if
it
were
real
whereas
nothing
can
be
more
certain
than
that
if
my
cousin
of
france
had
ever
received
such
an
offer
he
would
have
been
the
last
person
to
have
put
me
on
my
guard
against
the
attempt
no
he
knows
the
value
i
set
on
services
and
forged
the
accusation
to
deprive
me
of
them
and
yet
my
lord
replied
the
english
earl
your
highness
by
my
counsel
will
not
unnecessarily
or
impatiently
fling
aside
your
armour
of
proof
or
ride
without
the
escort
of
some
score
of
your
trusty
walloons
tush
man
thou
wouldst
make
a
carbonado
of
a
wretch
like
myself
betwixt
the
bright
iron
and
the
burning
sun
but
i
will
be
cautious
though
i
jest
thus
and
you
young
man
may
assure
my
cousin
margaret
of
anjou
that
i
will
consider
her
affairs
as
my
own
and
remember
youth
that
the
secrets
of
princes
are
fatal
gifts
if
he
to
whom
they
are
imparted
blaze
them
abroad
but
if
duly
treasured
up
they
enrich
the
bearer
and
thou
shalt
have
cause
to
say
so
if
thou
canst
bring
back
with
thee
from
aix
the
deed
of
resignation
of
which
thy
father
hath
he
left
the
apartment
you
have
just
seen
said
the
earl
of
oxford
to
his
son
a
sketch
of
this
extraordinary
prince
by
his
own
pencil
it
is
easy
to
excite
his
ambition
or
thirst
of
power
but
impossible
to
limit
him
to
the
just
measures
by
which
it
is
most
likely
to
be
gratified
he
is
ever
like
the
young
archer
startled
from
his
mark
by
some
swallow
crossing
his
eye
even
careless
as
he
draws
the
string
now
irregularly
and
offensively
suspicious
now
unreservedly
lavish
of
his
confidence
not
long
since
the
enemy
of
the
line
of
lancaster
and
the
ally
of
her
deadly
foe
now
its
last
and
only
stay
and
hope
god
mend
all
it
is
a
weary
thing
to
look
on
the
game
and
see
how
it
might
be
won
while
we
are
debarred
by
the
caprice
of
others
from
the
power
of
playing
it
according
to
our
own
skill
how
much
must
depend
on
the
decision
of
duke
charles
upon
the
morrow
and
how
little
do
i
possess
the
power
of
influencing
him
either
for
his
own
safety
or
our
advantage
my
son
and
let
us
trust
events
to
him
who
alone
can
control
them
chapter
ix
my
blood
hath
been
too
cold
and
temperate
unapt
to
stir
at
these
indignities
and
you
have
found
me
for
accordingly
you
tread
upon
my
patience
the
dawn
of
morning
roused
the
banished
earl
of
oxford
and
his
son
and
its
lights
were
scarce
abroad
on
the
eastern
heaven
ere
their
host
colvin
entered
with
an
attendant
bearing
some
bundles
which
he
placed
on
the
floor
of
the
tent
and
instantly
retired
the
officer
of
the
duke
ordnance
then
announced
that
he
came
with
a
message
from
the
duke
of
burgundy
his
highness
he
said
has
sent
four
stout
yeomen
with
a
commission
of
credence
to
my
young
master
of
oxford
and
an
ample
purse
of
gold
to
furnish
his
expenses
to
aix
and
while
his
affairs
may
detain
him
there
also
a
letter
of
credence
to
king
rené
to
insure
his
reception
and
two
suits
of
honour
for
his
use
as
for
an
english
gentleman
desirous
to
witness
the
festive
solemnities
of
provence
and
in
whose
safety
the
duke
deigns
to
take
deep
interest
his
further
affairs
there
if
he
hath
any
his
highness
recommends
to
him
to
manage
with
prudence
and
secrecy
his
highness
hath
also
sent
a
couple
of
horses
for
his
use
one
an
ambling
jennet
for
the
road
and
another
a
strong
barbed
horse
of
flanders
in
case
he
hath
aught
to
do
it
will
be
fitting
that
my
young
master
change
his
dress
and
assume
attire
more
near
his
proper
rank
his
attendants
know
the
road
and
have
power
in
case
of
need
to
summon
in
the
duke
name
assistance
from
all
faithful
burgundians
i
have
but
to
add
the
sooner
the
young
gentleman
sets
forward
it
will
be
the
better
sign
of
a
successful
journey
i
am
ready
to
mount
the
instant
that
i
have
changed
my
dress
said
arthur
and
i
said
his
father
have
no
wish
to
detain
him
on
the
service
in
which
he
is
now
employed
neither
he
nor
i
will
say
more
than
god
be
with
you
how
and
where
we
are
to
meet
again
who
can
tell
i
believe
said
colvin
that
must
rest
on
the
motions
of
the
duke
which
perchance
are
not
yet
determined
upon
but
his
highness
depends
upon
your
remaining
with
him
my
noble
lord
till
the
affairs
of
which
you
come
to
treat
may
be
more
fully
decided
something
i
have
for
your
lordship
private
ear
when
your
son
hath
parted
on
his
journey
while
colvin
was
thus
talking
with
his
father
arthur
who
was
not
above
when
he
entered
the
tent
had
availed
himself
of
an
obscure
corner
in
which
he
exchanged
the
plain
garb
belonging
to
his
supposed
condition
as
a
merchant
for
such
a
as
became
a
young
man
of
some
quality
attached
to
the
court
of
burgundy
it
was
not
without
a
natural
sensation
of
pleasure
that
the
youth
resumed
an
apparel
suitable
to
his
birth
and
which
no
one
was
personally
more
fitted
to
become
but
it
was
with
much
deeper
feeling
that
he
hastily
and
as
secretly
as
possible
flung
round
his
neck
and
concealed
under
the
collar
and
folds
of
his
ornamented
doublet
a
small
thin
chain
of
gold
curiously
linked
in
what
was
called
morisco
work
this
was
the
contents
of
the
parcel
which
anne
of
geierstein
had
indulged
his
feelings
and
perhaps
her
own
by
putting
into
his
hands
as
they
parted
the
chain
was
secured
by
a
slight
plate
of
gold
on
which
a
bodkin
or
a
point
of
a
knife
had
traced
on
the
one
side
in
distinct
though
light
characters
adieu
for
ever
while
on
the
reverse
there
was
much
more
obscurely
traced
the
word
remember
a
von
all
who
may
read
this
are
have
been
or
will
be
lovers
and
there
is
none
therefore
who
may
not
be
able
to
comprehend
why
this
token
was
carefully
suspended
around
arthur
neck
so
that
the
inscription
might
rest
on
the
region
of
his
heart
without
the
interruption
of
any
substance
which
could
prevent
the
pledge
from
being
agitated
by
every
throb
of
that
busy
organ
this
being
hastily
insured
a
few
minutes
completed
the
rest
of
his
toilette
and
he
kneeled
before
his
father
to
ask
his
blessing
and
his
further
commands
for
aix
his
father
blessed
him
almost
inarticulately
and
then
said
with
recovered
firmness
that
he
was
already
possessed
of
all
the
knowledge
necessary
for
success
on
his
mission
when
you
can
bring
me
the
deeds
wanted
he
whispered
with
more
firmness
you
will
find
me
near
the
person
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
they
went
forth
of
the
tent
in
silence
and
found
before
it
the
four
burgundian
yeomen
tall
and
men
ready
mounted
themselves
and
holding
two
saddled
horses
the
one
accoutred
for
war
the
other
a
spirited
jennet
for
the
purposes
of
the
journey
one
of
them
led
a
on
which
colvin
informed
arthur
he
would
find
the
change
of
habit
necessary
when
he
should
arrive
at
aix
and
at
the
same
time
delivered
to
him
a
heavy
purse
of
gold
thiebault
he
continued
pointing
out
the
eldest
of
the
attendant
troopers
may
be
trusted
i
will
be
warrant
for
his
sagacity
and
fidelity
the
other
three
are
picked
men
who
will
not
fear
their
arthur
vaulted
into
the
saddle
with
a
sensation
of
pleasure
which
was
natural
to
a
young
cavalier
who
had
not
for
many
months
felt
a
spirited
horse
beneath
him
the
lively
jennet
reared
with
impatience
arthur
sitting
firm
on
his
seat
as
if
he
had
been
a
part
of
the
animal
only
said
ere
we
are
long
acquainted
thy
spirit
my
fair
roan
will
be
something
more
tamed
one
word
more
my
son
said
his
father
and
whispered
in
ear
as
he
stooped
from
the
saddle
if
you
receive
a
letter
from
me
do
not
think
yourself
fully
acquainted
with
the
contents
till
the
paper
has
been
held
opposite
to
a
hot
fire
arthur
bowed
and
motioned
to
the
elder
trooper
to
lead
the
way
when
all
giving
rein
to
their
horses
rode
off
through
the
encampment
at
a
round
pace
the
young
leader
signing
an
adieu
to
his
father
and
colvin
the
earl
stood
like
a
man
in
a
dream
following
his
son
with
his
eyes
in
a
kind
of
reverie
which
was
only
broken
when
colvin
said
i
marvel
not
my
lord
that
you
are
anxious
about
my
young
master
he
is
a
gallant
youth
well
worth
a
father
caring
for
and
the
times
we
live
in
are
both
false
and
bloody
god
and
mary
be
my
witness
said
the
earl
that
if
i
grieve
it
is
not
for
my
own
house
only
if
i
am
anxious
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
my
own
son
alone
but
it
is
hard
to
risk
a
last
stake
in
a
cause
so
what
commands
brought
you
from
the
duke
his
grace
said
colvin
will
get
on
horseback
after
he
has
breakfasted
he
sends
you
some
garments
which
if
not
fitting
your
quality
are
yet
nearer
to
suitable
apparel
than
those
you
now
wear
and
he
desires
that
observing
your
incognito
as
an
english
merchant
of
eminence
you
will
join
him
in
his
cavalcade
to
dijon
where
he
is
to
receive
the
answer
of
the
estates
of
burgundy
concerning
matters
submitted
to
their
consideration
and
thereafter
give
public
audience
to
the
deputies
from
switzerland
his
highness
has
charged
me
with
the
care
of
finding
you
suitable
accommodation
during
the
ceremonies
of
the
day
which
he
thinks
you
will
as
a
stranger
be
pleased
to
look
upon
but
he
probably
told
you
all
this
himself
for
i
think
you
saw
him
last
night
in
disguise
nay
look
as
strange
as
you
will
the
duke
plays
that
trick
too
often
to
be
able
to
do
it
with
secrecy
the
very
know
him
while
he
traverses
the
tents
of
the
common
soldiery
and
sutler
women
give
him
the
name
of
the
spied
spy
if
it
were
only
honest
harry
colvin
who
knew
this
it
should
not
cross
his
lips
but
it
is
practised
too
openly
and
too
widely
known
come
noble
lord
though
i
must
teach
my
tongue
to
forego
that
courtesy
will
you
along
to
breakfast
the
meal
according
to
the
practice
of
the
time
was
a
solemn
and
solid
one
and
a
favoured
officer
of
the
great
duke
of
burgundy
lacked
no
means
it
may
be
believed
of
rendering
due
hospitality
to
a
guest
having
claims
of
such
high
respect
but
ere
the
breakfast
was
over
a
clamorous
flourish
of
trumpets
announced
that
the
duke
with
his
attendants
and
retinue
were
sounding
to
horse
philipson
as
he
was
still
called
was
in
the
name
of
the
duke
presented
with
a
stately
charger
and
with
his
host
mingled
in
the
splendid
assembly
which
began
to
gather
in
front
of
the
duke
pavilion
in
a
few
minutes
the
prince
himself
issued
forth
in
the
superb
dress
of
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
of
which
his
father
philip
had
been
the
founder
and
charles
was
himself
the
patron
and
sovereign
several
of
his
courtiers
were
dressed
in
the
same
magnificent
robes
and
with
their
followers
and
attendants
displayed
so
much
wealth
and
splendour
of
appearance
as
to
warrant
the
common
saying
that
the
duke
of
burgundy
maintained
the
most
magnificent
court
in
christendom
the
officers
of
his
household
attended
in
their
order
together
with
heralds
and
pursuivants
the
grotesque
richness
of
whose
habits
had
a
singular
effect
among
those
of
the
high
clergy
in
their
albes
and
dalmatiques
and
of
the
knights
and
crown
vassals
who
were
arrayed
in
armour
among
these
last
who
were
variously
equipped
according
to
the
different
character
of
their
service
rode
oxford
but
in
a
peaceful
habit
neither
so
plain
as
to
be
out
of
place
amongst
such
splendour
nor
so
rich
as
to
draw
on
him
a
special
or
particular
degree
of
attention
he
rode
by
the
side
of
colvin
his
tall
muscular
figure
and
features
forming
a
strong
contrast
to
the
rough
almost
ignoble
cast
of
countenance
and
stout
form
of
the
less
distinguished
soldier
of
fortune
ranged
into
a
solemn
procession
the
rear
of
which
was
closed
by
a
guard
of
two
hundred
picked
arquebusiers
a
description
of
soldiers
who
were
just
then
coming
into
notice
and
as
many
mounted
the
duke
and
his
retinue
leaving
the
barriers
of
the
camp
directed
their
march
to
the
town
or
rather
city
of
dijon
in
those
days
the
capital
of
all
burgundy
it
was
a
town
well
secured
with
walls
and
ditches
which
last
were
filled
by
means
of
a
small
river
named
the
ousche
which
combines
its
waters
for
that
purpose
with
a
torrent
called
suzon
four
gates
with
appropriate
barbicans
outworks
and
drawbridges
corresponded
nearly
to
the
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
and
gave
admission
to
the
city
the
number
of
towers
which
stood
high
above
its
walls
and
defended
them
at
different
angles
was
and
the
walls
themselves
which
exceeded
in
most
places
the
height
of
thirty
feet
were
built
of
stones
hewn
and
squared
and
were
of
great
thickness
this
stately
city
was
surrounded
on
the
outside
with
hills
covered
with
vineyards
while
from
within
its
walls
rose
the
towers
of
many
noble
buildings
both
public
and
private
as
well
as
the
steeples
of
magnificent
churches
and
of
convents
attesting
the
wealth
and
devotion
of
the
house
of
burgundy
when
the
trumpets
of
the
duke
procession
had
summoned
the
burgher
guard
at
the
gate
of
nicholas
the
drawbridge
fell
the
portcullis
rose
the
people
shouted
joyously
the
windows
were
hung
with
tapestry
and
as
in
the
midst
of
his
retinue
charles
himself
came
riding
on
a
steed
attended
only
by
six
pages
under
fourteen
years
old
with
each
a
gilded
partisan
in
his
hand
the
acclamations
with
which
he
was
received
on
all
sides
showed
that
if
some
instances
of
misrule
had
diminished
his
popularity
enough
of
it
remained
to
render
his
reception
into
his
capital
decorous
at
least
if
not
enthusiastic
it
is
probable
that
the
veneration
attached
to
his
father
memory
counteracted
for
a
long
time
the
unfavourable
effect
which
some
of
his
own
actions
were
calculated
to
produce
on
the
public
mind
the
procession
halted
before
a
large
gothic
building
in
the
centre
of
dijon
this
was
then
called
maison
du
duc
as
after
the
union
of
burgundy
with
france
it
was
termed
maison
du
roy
the
maire
of
dijon
attended
on
the
steps
before
this
palace
accompanied
by
his
official
brethren
and
escorted
by
a
hundred
citizens
in
black
velvet
cloaks
bearing
in
their
hands
the
maire
kneeled
to
kiss
the
stirrup
of
the
duke
and
at
the
moment
when
charles
descended
from
his
horse
every
bell
in
the
city
commenced
so
thundering
a
peal
that
they
might
almost
have
awakened
the
dead
who
slept
in
the
vicinity
of
the
steeples
which
rocked
with
their
clangour
under
the
influence
of
this
stunning
peal
of
welcome
the
duke
entered
the
great
hall
of
the
building
at
the
upper
end
of
which
were
erected
a
throne
for
the
sovereign
seats
for
his
more
distinguished
officers
of
state
and
higher
vassals
with
benches
behind
for
persons
of
less
note
on
one
of
these
but
in
a
spot
from
which
he
might
possess
a
commanding
view
of
the
whole
assembly
as
well
as
of
the
duke
himself
colvin
placed
the
noble
englishman
and
charles
whose
quick
stern
eye
glanced
rapidly
over
the
party
when
they
were
seated
seemed
by
a
nod
so
slight
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
to
those
around
him
to
give
his
approbation
of
the
arrangement
adopted
when
the
duke
and
his
assistants
were
seated
and
in
order
the
maire
again
approaching
in
the
most
humble
manner
and
kneeling
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
ducal
throne
requested
to
know
if
his
leisure
permitted
him
to
hear
the
inhabitants
of
his
capital
express
their
devoted
zeal
to
his
person
and
to
accept
the
benevolence
which
in
the
shape
of
a
silver
cup
filled
with
gold
pieces
he
had
the
distinguished
honour
to
place
before
his
feet
in
name
of
the
citizens
and
community
of
dijon
charles
who
at
no
time
affected
much
courtesy
answered
briefly
and
bluntly
with
a
voice
which
was
naturally
harsh
and
dissonant
all
things
in
their
order
good
master
maire
let
us
first
hear
what
the
estates
of
burgundy
have
to
say
to
us
we
will
then
listen
to
the
burghers
of
dijon
the
maire
rose
and
retired
bearing
in
his
hand
the
silver
cup
and
experiencing
probably
some
vexation
as
well
as
surprise
that
its
contents
had
not
secured
an
instant
and
gracious
acceptance
i
expected
said
duke
charles
to
have
met
at
this
hour
and
place
our
estates
of
the
duchy
of
burgundy
or
a
deputation
of
them
with
an
answer
to
our
message
conveyed
to
them
three
days
since
by
our
chancellor
is
there
no
one
here
on
their
part
the
maire
as
none
else
made
any
attempt
to
answer
said
that
the
members
of
the
estates
had
been
in
close
deliberation
the
whole
of
that
morning
and
doubtless
would
instantly
wait
upon
his
highness
when
they
heard
that
he
had
honoured
the
town
with
his
presence
go
toison
said
the
duke
to
the
herald
of
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
bear
to
these
gentlemen
the
tidings
that
we
desire
to
know
the
end
of
their
deliberations
and
that
neither
in
courtesy
nor
in
loyalty
can
they
expect
us
to
wait
long
be
round
with
them
sir
herald
or
we
shall
be
as
round
with
you
while
the
herald
was
absent
on
his
mission
we
may
remind
our
readers
that
in
all
feudalised
countries
that
is
to
say
in
almost
all
europe
during
the
middle
ages
an
ardent
spirit
of
liberty
pervaded
the
constitution
and
the
only
fault
that
could
be
found
was
that
the
privileges
and
freedom
for
which
the
great
vassals
contended
did
not
sufficiently
descend
to
the
lower
orders
of
society
or
extend
protection
to
those
who
were
most
likely
to
need
it
the
two
first
ranks
in
the
estate
the
nobles
and
clergy
enjoyed
high
and
important
privileges
and
even
the
third
estate
or
citizens
had
this
immunity
in
peculiar
that
no
new
duties
customs
or
taxes
of
any
kind
could
be
exacted
from
them
save
by
their
own
consent
the
memory
of
duke
philip
the
father
of
charles
was
dear
to
the
burgundians
for
during
twenty
years
that
sage
prince
had
maintained
his
rank
amongst
the
sovereigns
of
europe
with
much
dignity
and
had
accumulated
treasure
without
exacting
or
receiving
any
great
increase
of
supplies
from
the
rich
countries
which
he
governed
but
the
extravagant
schemes
and
immoderate
expense
of
duke
charles
had
already
excited
the
suspicion
of
his
estates
and
the
mutual
betwixt
the
prince
and
people
began
to
be
exchanged
for
suspicion
and
distrust
on
the
one
side
and
defiance
on
the
other
the
refractory
disposition
of
the
estates
had
of
late
increased
for
they
had
disapproved
of
various
wars
in
which
their
duke
had
needlessly
embarked
and
from
his
levying
such
large
bodies
of
mercenary
troops
they
came
to
suspect
he
might
finally
employ
the
wealth
voted
to
him
by
his
subjects
for
the
undue
extension
of
his
royal
prerogative
and
the
destruction
of
the
liberties
of
the
people
at
the
same
time
the
duke
uniform
success
in
enterprises
which
appeared
desperate
as
well
as
difficult
esteem
for
the
frankness
and
openness
of
his
character
and
dread
of
the
obstinacy
and
headstrong
tendency
of
a
temper
which
could
seldom
bear
persuasion
and
never
endured
opposition
still
threw
awe
and
terror
around
the
throne
which
was
materially
aided
by
the
attachment
of
the
common
people
to
the
person
of
the
present
duke
and
to
the
memory
of
his
father
it
had
been
understood
that
upon
the
present
occasion
there
was
strong
opposition
amongst
the
estates
to
the
system
of
taxation
proposed
on
the
part
of
the
duke
and
the
issue
was
expected
with
considerable
anxiety
by
the
duke
counsellors
and
with
fretful
impatience
by
the
sovereign
himself
after
a
space
of
about
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
the
chancellor
of
burgundy
who
was
archbishop
of
vienne
and
a
prelate
of
high
rank
entered
the
hall
with
his
train
and
passing
behind
the
ducal
throne
to
occupy
one
of
the
most
distinguished
places
in
the
assembly
he
stopped
for
a
moment
to
urge
his
master
to
receive
the
answer
of
his
estates
in
a
private
manner
giving
him
at
the
same
time
to
understand
that
the
result
of
the
deliberations
had
been
by
no
means
satisfactory
by
george
of
burgundy
my
lord
archbishop
answered
the
duke
sternly
and
aloud
we
are
not
a
prince
of
a
mind
so
paltry
that
we
need
to
shun
the
moody
looks
of
a
discontented
and
insolent
faction
if
the
estates
of
burgundy
send
a
disobedient
and
disloyal
answer
to
our
paternal
message
let
them
deliver
it
in
open
court
that
the
assembled
people
may
learn
how
to
decide
between
their
duke
and
those
petty
yet
intriguing
spirits
who
would
interfere
with
our
authority
the
chancellor
bowed
gravely
and
took
his
seat
while
the
english
earl
observed
that
most
of
the
members
of
the
assembly
excepting
such
as
in
doing
so
could
not
escape
the
duke
notice
passed
some
observations
to
their
neighbours
which
were
received
with
a
nod
shrug
or
shake
of
the
head
as
men
treat
a
proposal
upon
which
it
is
dangerous
to
decide
at
the
same
time
toison
who
acted
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
introduced
into
the
hall
a
committee
of
the
estates
consisting
of
twelve
members
four
from
each
branch
of
the
estates
announced
as
empowered
to
deliver
the
answer
of
that
assembly
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
when
the
deputation
entered
the
hall
charles
arose
from
his
throne
according
to
ancient
custom
and
taking
from
his
head
his
bonnet
charged
with
a
huge
plume
of
feathers
health
and
welcome
he
said
to
my
good
subjects
of
the
estates
of
burgundy
all
the
numerous
train
of
courtiers
rose
and
uncovered
their
heads
with
the
same
ceremony
the
members
of
the
states
then
dropped
on
one
knee
the
four
ecclesiastics
among
whom
oxford
recognised
the
black
priest
of
paul
approaching
nearest
to
the
duke
person
the
nobles
kneeling
behind
them
and
the
burgesses
in
the
rear
of
the
whole
noble
duke
said
the
priest
of
paul
will
it
best
please
you
to
hear
the
answer
of
your
good
and
loyal
estates
of
burgundy
by
the
voice
of
one
member
speaking
for
the
whole
or
by
three
persons
each
delivering
the
sense
of
the
body
to
which
he
belongs
as
you
will
said
the
duke
of
burgundy
a
priest
a
noble
and
a
free
burgher
said
the
churchman
still
on
one
knee
will
address
your
highness
in
succession
for
though
blessed
be
the
god
who
leads
brethren
to
dwell
together
in
unity
we
are
agreed
in
the
general
answer
yet
each
body
of
the
estates
may
have
special
and
separate
reasons
to
allege
for
the
common
opinion
we
will
hear
you
separately
said
duke
charles
casting
his
hat
upon
his
head
and
throwing
himself
carelessly
back
into
his
seat
at
the
same
time
all
who
were
of
noble
blood
whether
in
the
committee
or
amongst
the
spectators
vouched
their
right
to
be
peers
of
their
sovereign
by
assuming
their
bonnets
and
a
cloud
of
waving
plumes
at
once
added
grace
and
dignity
to
the
assembly
when
the
duke
resumed
his
seat
the
deputation
arose
from
their
knees
and
the
black
priest
of
paul
again
stepping
forth
addressed
him
in
these
words
my
lord
duke
your
loyal
and
faithful
clergy
have
considered
your
highness
proposal
to
lay
a
talliage
on
your
people
in
order
to
make
war
on
the
confederate
cantons
in
the
country
of
the
alps
the
quarrel
my
liege
lord
seems
to
your
clergy
an
unjust
and
oppressive
one
on
your
highness
part
nor
can
they
hope
that
god
will
bless
those
who
arm
in
it
they
are
therefore
compelled
to
reject
your
highness
proposal
the
duke
eye
lowered
gloomily
on
the
deliverer
of
this
unpalatable
message
he
shook
his
head
with
one
of
those
stern
and
menacing
looks
which
the
harsh
composition
of
his
features
rendered
them
peculiarly
qualified
to
express
you
have
spoken
sir
priest
was
the
only
reply
which
he
deigned
to
make
one
of
the
four
nobles
the
sire
de
myrebeau
then
expressed
himself
thus
your
highness
has
asked
of
your
faithful
nobles
to
consent
to
new
imposts
and
exactions
to
be
levied
through
burgundy
for
the
raising
of
additional
bands
of
hired
soldiers
for
the
maintenance
of
the
quarrels
of
the
state
my
lord
the
swords
of
the
burgundian
nobles
knights
and
gentlemen
have
been
ever
at
your
highness
command
as
those
of
our
ancestors
have
been
readily
wielded
for
your
predecessors
in
your
highness
just
quarrel
we
will
go
farther
and
fight
firmer
than
any
hired
fellows
who
can
be
procured
whether
from
france
or
germany
or
italy
we
will
not
give
our
consent
that
the
people
should
be
taxed
for
paying
mercenaries
to
discharge
that
military
duty
which
it
is
alike
our
pride
and
our
exclusive
privilege
to
render
you
have
spoken
sire
de
myrebeau
were
again
the
only
words
of
the
duke
reply
he
uttered
them
slowly
and
with
deliberation
as
if
afraid
lest
some
phrase
of
imprudent
violence
should
escape
along
with
what
he
purposed
to
say
oxford
thought
he
cast
a
glance
towards
him
before
he
spoke
as
if
the
consciousness
of
his
presence
was
some
additional
restraint
on
his
passion
now
heaven
grant
he
said
to
himself
that
this
opposition
may
work
its
proper
effect
and
induce
the
duke
to
renounce
an
imprudent
attempt
so
hazardous
and
so
unnecessary
while
he
muttered
these
thoughts
the
duke
made
a
sign
to
one
of
the
or
commons
to
speak
in
his
turn
the
person
who
obeyed
the
signal
was
martin
block
a
wealthy
butcher
and
grazier
of
dijon
his
words
were
these
noble
prince
our
fathers
were
the
dutiful
subjects
of
your
predecessors
we
are
the
same
to
you
our
children
will
be
alike
the
liegemen
of
your
successors
but
touching
the
request
your
chancellor
has
made
to
us
it
is
such
as
our
ancestors
never
complied
with
such
as
we
are
determined
to
refuse
and
such
as
will
never
be
conceded
by
the
estates
of
burgundy
to
any
prince
whatsoever
even
to
the
end
of
time
charles
had
borne
with
impatient
silence
the
speeches
of
the
two
former
orators
but
this
blunt
and
hardy
reply
of
the
third
estate
excited
him
beyond
what
his
nature
could
endure
he
gave
way
to
the
impetuosity
of
his
disposition
stamped
on
the
floor
till
the
throne
shook
and
the
high
vault
rung
over
their
heads
and
overwhelmed
the
bold
burgher
with
reproaches
beast
of
burden
he
said
am
i
to
be
stunned
with
thy
braying
too
the
nobles
may
claim
leave
to
speak
for
they
can
fight
the
clergy
may
use
their
tongues
for
it
is
their
trade
but
thou
that
hast
never
shed
blood
save
that
of
bullocks
more
stupid
than
thou
art
thyself
must
thou
and
thy
herd
come
hither
privileged
forsooth
to
bellow
at
a
prince
footstool
know
brute
as
thou
art
that
steers
are
never
introduced
into
temples
but
to
be
sacrificed
or
butchers
and
mechanics
brought
before
their
sovereign
save
that
they
may
have
the
honour
to
supply
the
public
wants
from
their
own
swelling
hoards
a
murmur
of
displeasure
which
even
the
terror
of
the
duke
wrath
could
not
repress
ran
through
the
audience
at
these
words
and
the
burgher
of
dijon
a
sturdy
plebeian
replied
with
little
reverence
our
purses
my
lord
duke
are
our
own
we
will
not
put
the
strings
of
them
into
your
highness
hands
unless
we
are
satisfied
with
the
purposes
to
which
the
money
is
to
be
applied
and
we
know
well
how
to
protect
our
persons
and
our
goods
against
foreign
ruffians
and
plunderers
charles
was
on
the
point
of
ordering
the
deputy
to
be
arrested
when
having
cast
his
eye
towards
the
earl
of
oxford
whose
presence
in
despite
of
himself
imposed
a
certain
degree
of
restraint
upon
him
he
exchanged
that
piece
of
imprudence
for
another
i
see
he
said
addressing
the
committee
of
estates
that
you
are
all
leagued
to
disappoint
my
purposes
and
doubtless
to
deprive
me
of
all
the
power
of
a
sovereign
save
that
of
wearing
a
coronet
and
being
served
on
the
knee
like
a
second
charles
the
simple
while
the
estates
of
my
kingdom
divide
the
power
among
them
but
you
shall
know
that
you
have
to
do
with
charles
of
burgundy
a
prince
who
though
he
has
deigned
to
consult
you
is
fully
able
to
fight
battles
without
the
aid
of
his
nobles
since
they
refuse
him
the
assistance
of
their
swords
to
defray
the
expense
without
the
help
of
his
sordid
burghers
and
it
may
be
to
find
out
a
path
to
heaven
without
the
assistance
of
an
ungrateful
priesthood
i
will
show
all
that
are
here
present
how
little
my
mind
is
affected
or
my
purpose
changed
by
your
seditious
reply
to
the
message
with
which
i
honoured
here
toison
admit
into
our
presence
these
men
from
the
confederated
towns
and
cantons
as
they
call
themselves
of
switzerland
oxford
and
all
who
really
interested
themselves
in
the
welfare
heard
with
the
utmost
apprehension
his
resolution
to
give
an
audience
to
the
swiss
envoys
prepossessed
as
he
was
against
them
and
in
the
moment
when
his
mood
was
chafed
to
the
uttermost
by
the
refusal
of
the
estates
to
grant
him
supplies
they
were
aware
that
obstacles
opposed
to
the
current
of
his
passion
were
like
rocks
in
the
bed
of
a
river
whose
course
they
can
not
interrupt
while
they
provoke
it
to
rage
and
foam
all
were
sensible
that
the
die
was
cast
but
none
who
were
not
endowed
with
more
than
mortal
prescience
could
have
imagined
how
deep
was
the
pledge
which
depended
upon
it
oxford
in
particular
conceived
that
the
execution
of
his
plan
of
a
descent
upon
england
was
the
principal
point
compromised
by
the
duke
in
his
rash
obstinacy
but
he
suspected
not
he
dreamed
not
of
supposing
that
the
life
of
charles
himself
and
the
independence
of
burgundy
as
a
separate
kingdom
hung
quivering
in
the
same
scales

for

had
been
kept
in
attendance
on

outside

receiving
the

of

which
among
civilised
nations
are
universally
paid

the

in
the
midst
of
an
assembly
blazing
with

served
to
confirm
the
idea
that
they
could
only
have
come
hither
in
the
capacity
of
the
most
humble
petitioners
oxford
however
who
watched
closely
the
deportment
of
his
late
failed
not
to
observe
that
they
retained
each
in
his
own
person
the
character
of
firmness
and
indifference
which
formerly
distinguished
them
rudolph
donnerhugel
preserved
his
bold
and
haughty
look
the
banneret
the
military
indifference
which
made
him
look
with
apparent
apathy
on
all
around
him
the
burgher
of
soleure
was
as
formal
and
important
as
ever
nor
did
any
of
the
three
show
themselves
affected
in
the
slightest
degree
by
the
splendour
of
the
scene
around
them
or
embarrassed
by
the
consideration
of
their
own
comparative
inferiority
of
appointments
but
the
noble
landamman
on
whom
oxford
chiefly
bent
his
attention
seemed
overwhelmed
with
a
sense
of
the
precarious
state
in
which
his
country
was
placed
fearing
from
the
rude
and
unhonoured
manner
in
which
they
were
received
that
war
was
unavoidable
while
at
the
same
time
like
a
good
patriot
he
mourned
over
the
consequences
of
ruin
to
the
freedom
of
his
country
by
defeat
or
injury
to
her
simplicity
and
virtuous
indifference

oxford
could
easily
explain
his
sadness
while
his
comrade
bonstetten
less
capable
of
comprehending
his
friend
feelings
looked
at
him
with
the
expression
which
may
be
seen
in
the
countenance
of
a
faithful
dog
when
the
creature
indicates
sympathy
with
his
master
melancholy
though
unable
to
ascertain
or
appreciate
its
cause
a
look
of
wonder
now
and
then
glided
around
the
splendid
assembly
on
the
part
of
all
the
forlorn
group
excepting
donnerhugel
and
the
landamman
for
the
indomitable
pride
of
the
one
and
the
steady
patriotism
of
the
other
could
not
for
even
an
instant
be
diverted
by
external
objects
from
their
own
deep
and
stern
reflections
after
a
silence
of
nearly
five
minutes
the
duke
spoke
with
the
haughty
and
harsh
manner
which
he
might
imagine
belonged
to
his
place
and
which
certainly
expressed
his
character
men
of
berne
of
schwitz
or
of
whatever
hamlet
and
wilderness
you
may
represent
know
that
we
had
not
honoured
you
rebels
as
you
are
to
the
dominion
of
your
lawful
superiors
with
an
audience
in
our
own
presence
but
for
the
intercession
of
a
friend
who
has
sojourned
among
your
mountains
and
whom
you
may
know
by
the
name
of
philipson
an
englishman
following
the
trade
of
a
merchant
and
charged
with
certain
valuable
matters
of
traffic
to
our
court
to
his
intercession
we
have
so
far
given
way
that
instead
of
commanding
you
according
to
your
demerits
to
the
gibbet
and
the
wheel
in
the
place
de
morimont
we
have
condescended
to
receive
you
into
our
own
presence
sitting
in
our
to
hear
from
you
such
submission
as
you
can
offer
for
your
outrageous
storm
of
our
town
of
la
ferette
the
slaughter
of
many
of
our
liegemen
and
the
deliberate
murder
of
the
noble
knight
archibald
of
hagenbach
executed
in
your
presence
and
by
your
countenance
and
device
speak
if
you
can
say
aught
in
defence
of
your
felony
and
treason
either
to
deprecate
just
punishment
or
crave
undeserved
mercy
the
landamman
seemed
about
to
answer
but
rudolph
donnerhugel
with
his
characteristic
boldness
and
hardihood
took
the
task
of
reply
on
himself
he
confronted
the
proud
duke
with
an
eye
unappalled
and
a
countenance
as
stern
as
his
own
we
came
not
here
he
said
to
compromise
our
own
honour
or
the
dignity
of
the
free
people
whom
we
represent
by
pleading
guilty
in
their
name
or
our
own
to
crimes
of
which
we
are
innocent
and
when
you
term
us
rebels
you
must
remember
that
a
long
train
of
victories
whose
history
is
written
in
the
noblest
blood
of
austria
has
restored
to
the
confederacy
of
our
communities
the
freedom
of
which
an
unjust
tyranny
in
vain
attempted
to
deprive
us
while
austria
was
a
just
and
beneficent
mistress
we
served
her
with
our
lives
when
she
became
oppressive
and
tyrannical
we
assumed
independence
if
she
has
aught
yet
to
claim
from
us
the
descendants
of
tell
faust
and
stauffacher
will
be
as
ready
to
assert
their
liberties
as
their
fathers
were
to
gain
them
your
grace
if
such
be
your
title
has
no
concern
with
any
dispute
betwixt
us
and
austria
for
your
threats
of
gibbet
and
wheel
we
are
here
defenceless
men
on
whom
you
may
work
your
pleasure
but
we
know
how
to
die
and
our
countrymen
know
how
to
avenge
us
the
fiery
duke
would
have
replied
by
commanding
the
instant
arrest
and
probably
the
immediate
execution
of
the
whole
deputation
but
his
chancellor
availing
himself
of
the
privilege
of
his
office
rose
and
doffing
his
cap
with
a
deep
reverence
to
the
duke
requested
leave
to
reply
to
the
misproud
young
man
who
had
he
said
so
greatly
mistaken
the
purpose
of
his
highness
speech
charles
feeling
perhaps
at
the
moment
too
much
irritated
to
form
a
calm
decision
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
of
state
and
with
an
impatient
and
angry
nod
gave
his
chancellor
permission
to
speak
young
man
said
that
high
officer
you
have
mistaken
the
meaning
of
the
high
and
mighty
sovereign
in
whose
presence
you
stand
whatever
be
the
lawful
rights
of
austria
over
the
revolted
villages
which
have
flung
off
their
allegiance
to
their
native
superior
we
have
no
call
to
enter
on
that
argument
but
that
for
which
burgundy
demands
your
answer
is
wherefore
coming
here
in
the
guise
and
with
the
character
of
peaceful
envoys
on
affairs
touching
your
own
communities
and
the
rights
of
the
duke
subjects
you
have
raised
war
in
our
peaceful
dominions
stormed
a
fortress
massacred
its
garrison
and
put
to
death
a
noble
knight
its
commander
all
of
them
actions
contrary
to
the
law
of
nations
and
highly
deserving
of
the
punishment
with
which
you
have
been
justly
threatened
but
with
which
i
hope
our
gracious
sovereign
will
dispense
if
you
express
some
sufficient
reason
for
such
outrageous
insolence
with
an
offer
of
due
submission
to
his
highness
pleasure
and
satisfactory
reparation
for
such
a
high
injury
you
are
a
priest
grave
sir
answered
rudolph
donnerhugel
addressing
the
chancellor
of
burgundy
if
there
be
a
soldier
in
this
assembly
who
will
avouch
your
charge
i
challenge
him
to
the
combat
man
to
man
we
did
not
storm
the
garrison
of
la
ferette
we
were
admitted
into
the
gates
in
a
peaceful
manner
and
were
there
instantly
surrounded
by
the
soldiers
of
the
late
archibald
de
hagenbach
with
the
obvious
purpose
of
assaulting
and
murdering
us
on
our
peaceful
mission
i
promise
you
there
had
been
news
of
more
men
dying
than
us
but
an
uproar
broke
out
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
assisted
i
believe
by
many
neighbours
to
whom
the
insolence
and
oppression
of
archibald
de
hagenbach
had
become
odious
as
to
all
who
were
within
his
reach
we
rendered
them
no
assistance
and
i
trust
it
was
not
expected
that
we
should
interfere
in
the
favour
of
men
who
had
stood
prepared
to
do
the
worst
against
us
but
not
a
pike
or
sword
belonging
to
us
or
our
attendants
was
dipped
in
burgundian
blood
archibald
de
hagenbach
perished
it
is
true
on
a
scaffold
and
i
saw
him
die
with
pleasure
under
a
sentence
pronounced
by
a
competent
court
such
as
is
recognised
in
westphalia
and
its
dependencies
on
this
side
of
the
rhine
i
am
not
obliged
to
vindicate
their
proceedings
but
i
aver
that
the
duke
has
received
full
proof
of
his
regular
sentence
and
in
fine
that
it
was
amply
deserved
by
oppression
tyranny
and
foul
abuse
of
his
authority
i
will
uphold
against
all
gainsayers
with
the
body
of
a
man
there
lies
my
glove
and
with
an
action
suited
to
the
language
he
used
the
stern
swiss
flung
his
glove
on
the
floor
of
the
hall
in
the
spirit
of
the
age
with
the
love
of
distinction
in
arms
which
it
nourished
and
perhaps
with
the
desire
of
gaining
the
duke
favour
there
was
a
general
motion
among
the
young
burgundians
to
accept
the
challenge
and
more
than
six
or
eight
gloves
were
hastily
doffed
by
the
young
knights
present
those
who
were
more
remote
flinging
them
over
the
heads
of
the
nearest
and
each
proclaiming
his
name
and
title
as
he
proffered
the
gage
of
combat
i
set
at
all
said
the
daring
young
swiss
gathering
the
gauntlets
as
they
fell
clashing
around
him
more
gentlemen
more
a
glove
for
every
finger
come
on
one
at
once
fair
lists
equal
judges
of
the
field
the
combat
on
foot
and
the
weapons
swords
and
i
will
not
budge
for
a
score
of
you
illustration
the
defiance
drawn
and
etched
by
de
los
rios
hold
gentlemen
on
your
allegiance
hold
said
the
duke
gratified
at
the
same
time
and
somewhat
appeased
by
the
zeal
which
was
displayed
in
his
cause
moved
by
the
strain
of
reckless
bravery
evinced
by
the
challenger
with
a
hardihood
akin
to
his
own
perhaps
also
not
unwilling
to
display
in
the
view
of
his
more
temperance
than
he
had
been
at
first
capable
of
hold
i
command
you
toison
gather
up
these
gauntlets
and
return
them
each
to
his
owner
god
and
george
forbid
that
we
should
hazard
the
life
of
even
the
least
of
our
noble
burgundian
gentry
against
such
a
churl
as
this
swiss
peasant
who
never
so
much
as
mounted
a
horse
and
knows
not
a
jot
of
knightly
courtesy
or
the
grace
of
carry
your
vulgar
brawls
elsewhere
young
man
and
know
that
on
the
present
occasion
the
place
morimont
were
your
only
fitting
lists
and
the
hangman
your
meet
antagonist
and
you
sirs
his
companions
whose
behaviour
in
suffering
this
swaggerer
to
take
the
lead
amongst
you
seems
to
show
that
the
laws
of
nature
as
well
as
of
society
are
inverted
and
that
youth
is
preferred
to
age
as
gentry
to
peasants
you
men
i
say
is
there
none
of
you
who
can
speak
your
errand
in
such
language
as
it
becomes
a
sovereign
prince
to
listen
to
god
forbid
else
said
the
landamman
stepping
forward
and
silencing
rudolph
donnerhugel
who
was
commencing
an
answer
of
defiance
god
forbid
he
said
noble
duke
that
we
should
not
be
able
to
speak
so
as
to
be
understood
before
your
highness
since
i
trust
we
shall
speak
the
language
of
truth
peace
and
justice
nay
should
it
incline
your
highness
to
listen
to
us
the
more
favourably
for
our
humility
i
am
willing
to
humble
myself
rather
than
you
should
shun
to
hear
us
for
my
own
part
i
can
truly
say
that
though
i
have
lived
and
by
free
choice
have
resolved
to
die
a
husbandman
and
a
hunter
on
the
alps
of
the
unterwald
i
may
claim
by
birth
the
hereditary
right
to
speak
before
dukes
and
kings
and
the
emperor
himself
there
is
no
one
my
lord
duke
in
this
proud
assembly
who
derives
his
descent
from
a
nobler
source
than
geierstein
we
have
heard
of
you
said
the
duke
men
call
you
the
your
birth
is
your
shame
or
perhaps
your
mother
if
your
father
had
happened
to
have
a
handsome
ploughman
the
fitting
father
of
one
who
has
become
a
willing
serf
no
serf
my
lord
answered
the
landamman
but
a
freeman
who
will
neither
oppress
others
nor
be
himself
tyrannised
over
my
father
was
a
noble
lord
my
mother
a
most
virtuous
lady
but
i
will
not
be
provoked
by
taunt
or
scornful
jest
to
refrain
from
stating
with
calmness
what
my
country
has
given
me
in
charge
to
say
the
inhabitants
of
the
bleak
and
inhospitable
regions
of
the
alps
desire
mighty
sir
to
remain
at
peace
with
all
their
neighbours
and
to
enjoy
the
government
they
have
chosen
as
best
fitted
to
their
condition
and
habits
leaving
all
other
states
and
countries
to
their
in
the
same
respects
especially
they
desire
to
remain
at
peace
and
in
unity
with
the
princely
house
of
burgundy
whose
dominions
approach
their
possessions
on
so
many
points
my
lord
they
desire
it
they
entreat
it
they
even
consent
to
pray
for
it
we
have
been
termed
stubborn
intractable
and
insolent
contemners
of
authority
and
headers
of
sedition
and
rebellion
in
evidence
of
the
contrary
my
lord
duke
i
who
never
bent
a
knee
but
to
heaven
feel
no
dishonour
in
kneeling
before
your
highness
as
before
a
sovereign
prince
in
the
of
his
dominions
where
he
has
a
right
to
exact
homage
from
his
subjects
out
of
duty
and
from
strangers
out
of
courtesy
no
vain
pride
of
mine
said
the
noble
old
man
his
eyes
swelling
with
tears
as
he
knelt
on
one
knee
shall
prevent
me
from
personal
humiliation
when
peace
that
blessed
peace
so
dear
to
god
so
inappreciably
valuable
to
man
is
in
danger
of
being
broken
off
the
whole
assembly
even
the
duke
himself
were
affected
by
the
noble
and
stately
manner
in
which
the
brave
old
man
made
a
genuflection
which
was
obviously
dictated
by
neither
meanness
nor
timidity
arise
sir
said
charles
if
we
have
said
aught
which
can
wound
your
private
feelings
we
retract
it
as
publicly
as
the
reproach
was
spoken
and
sit
prepared
to
hear
you
as
a
envoy
for
that
my
noble
lord
thanks
and
i
shall
hold
it
a
blessed
day
if
i
can
find
words
worthy
of
the
cause
i
have
to
plead
my
lord
a
schedule
in
your
highness
hands
has
stated
the
sense
of
many
injuries
received
at
the
hand
of
your
highness
officers
and
those
of
romont
count
of
savoy
your
strict
ally
and
adviser
we
have
a
right
to
suppose
under
your
highness
countenance
for
count
romont
he
has
already
felt
with
whom
he
has
to
contend
but
we
have
as
yet
taken
no
measures
to
avenge
injuries
affronts
interruptions
to
our
commerce
from
those
who
have
availed
themselves
of
your
highness
authority
to
intercept
our
countrymen
spoil
our
goods
impress
their
persons
and
even
in
some
instances
take
their
lives
the
affray
at
la
ferette
i
can
vouch
for
what
i
saw
had
no
origin
or
abettance
from
us
nevertheless
it
is
impossible
an
independent
nation
can
suffer
the
repetition
of
such
injuries
and
free
and
independent
we
are
determined
to
remain
or
to
die
in
defence
of
our
rights
what
then
must
follow
unless
your
highness
listens
to
the
terms
which
i
am
commissioned
to
offer
war
a
war
to
extermination
for
so
long
as
one
of
our
confederacy
can
wield
a
halberd
so
long
if
this
fatal
strife
once
commences
there
will
be
war
betwixt
your
powerful
realms
and
our
poor
and
barren
states
and
what
can
the
noble
duke
of
burgundy
gain
by
such
a
strife
is
it
wealth
and
plunder
alas
my
lord
there
is
more
gold
and
silver
on
the
very
of
your
highness
household
troops
than
can
be
found
in
the
public
treasures
or
private
hoards
of
our
whole
confederacy
is
it
fame
and
glory
you
aspire
to
there
is
little
honour
to
be
won
by
a
numerous
army
over
a
few
scattered
bands
by
men
clad
in
mail
over
husbandmen
and
shepherds
of
such
conquest
small
were
the
glory
but
if
as
all
christian
men
believe
and
as
it
is
the
constant
trust
of
my
countrymen
from
memory
of
the
times
of
our
fathers
if
the
lord
of
hosts
should
cast
the
balance
in
behalf
of
the
fewer
numbers
and
party
i
leave
it
with
your
highness
to
judge
what
would
in
that
event
be
the
diminution
of
worship
and
fame
is
it
extent
of
vassalage
and
dominion
your
highness
desires
by
warring
with
your
mountain
neighbours
know
that
you
may
if
it
be
god
will
gain
our
barren
and
rugged
mountains
but
like
our
ancestors
of
old
we
will
seek
refuge
in
wilder
and
more
distant
solitudes
and
when
we
have
resisted
to
the
last
we
will
starve
in
the
icy
wastes
of
the
glaciers
ay
men
women
and
children
we
will
be
frozen
into
annihilation
together
ere
one
free
switzer
will
acknowledge
a
foreign
master
the
speech
of
the
landamman
made
an
obvious
impression
on
the
assembly
the
duke
observed
it
and
his
hereditary
obstinacy
was
irritated
by
the
general
disposition
which
he
saw
entertained
in
favour
of
the
ambassador
this
evil
principle
overcame
some
impression
which
the
address
of
the
noble
biederman
had
not
failed
to
make
upon
him
he
answered
with
a
lowering
brow
interrupting
the
old
man
as
he
was
about
to
continue
his
speech
you
argue
falsely
sir
count
or
sir
landamman
or
by
whatever
name
you
call
yourself
if
you
think
we
war
on
you
from
any
hope
of
spoil
or
any
desire
of
glory
we
know
as
well
as
you
can
tell
us
that
there
is
neither
profit
nor
fame
to
be
achieved
by
conquering
you
but
sovereigns
to
whom
heaven
has
given
the
power
must
root
out
a
band
of
robbers
though
there
is
dishonour
in
measuring
swords
with
them
and
we
hunt
to
death
a
herd
of
wolves
though
their
flesh
is
carrion
and
their
skins
are
naught
the
landamman
shook
his
grey
head
and
replied
without
testifying
emotion
and
even
with
something
approaching
to
a
smile
i
am
an
older
woodsman
than
you
my
lord
duke
and
it
may
be
a
more
experienced
one
the
boldest
the
hardiest
hunter
will
not
safely
drive
the
wolf
to
his
den
i
have
shown
your
highness
the
poor
chance
of
gain
and
the
great
risk
of
loss
which
even
you
powerful
as
you
are
must
incur
by
risking
a
war
with
determined
and
desperate
men
let
me
now
tell
what
we
are
willing
to
do
to
secure
a
sincere
and
lasting
peace
with
our
powerful
neighbour
of
burgundy
your
grace
is
in
the
act
of
engrossing
lorraine
and
it
seems
probable
under
so
vigorous
and
enterprising
a
prince
your
authority
may
be
extended
to
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
be
our
noble
friend
and
sincere
ally
and
our
mountains
defended
by
warriors
familiar
with
victory
will
be
your
barriers
against
germany
and
italy
for
your
sake
we
will
admit
the
count
of
savoy
to
terms
and
restore
to
him
our
conquests
on
such
conditions
as
your
highness
shall
yourself
judge
reasonable
of
past
subjects
of
offence
on
the
part
of
your
lieutenants
and
governors
upon
the
frontier
we
will
be
silent
so
we
have
assurance
of
no
such
aggressions
in
future
nay
more
and
it
is
my
last
and
proudest
offer
we
will
send
three
thousand
of
our
youth
to
assist
your
highness
in
any
war
which
you
may
engage
in
whether
against
louis
of
france
or
the
emperor
of
germany
they
are
a
different
set
of
men
proudly
and
truly
may
i
state
it
from
the
scum
of
germany
and
italy
who
form
themselves
into
mercenary
bands
of
soldiers
and
if
heaven
should
decide
your
highness
to
accept
our
offer
there
will
be
one
corps
in
your
army
which
will
leave
their
carcasses
on
the
field
ere
a
man
of
them
break
their
plighted
troth
a
swarthy
but
tall
and
handsome
man
wearing
a
corselet
richly
engraved
with
arabesque
work
started
from
his
seat
with
the
air
of
one
provoked
beyond
the
bounds
of
restraint
this
was
the
count
de
commander
of
charles
italian
mercenaries
who
possessed
as
has
been
alluded
to
much
influence
over
the
mind
chiefly
obtained
by
accommodating
himself
to
his
opinions
and
prejudices
and
placing
before
the
duke
specious
arguments
to
justify
him
for
following
his
own
way
this
lofty
presence
must
excuse
me
he
said
if
i
speak
in
defence
of
my
honour
and
those
of
my
bold
lances
who
have
followed
my
fortunes
from
italy
to
serve
the
bravest
prince
in
christendom
i
might
indeed
pass
over
without
resentment
the
outrageous
language
of
this
churl
whose
words
can
not
affect
a
knight
and
a
nobleman
more
than
the
yelling
of
a
peasant
mastiff
but
when
i
hear
him
propose
to
associate
his
bands
of
mutinous
misgoverned
ruffians
with
your
highness
troops
i
must
let
him
know
that
there
is
not
a
in
my
ranks
who
would
fight
in
such
fellowship
no
even
i
myself
bound
by
a
thousand
ties
of
gratitude
could
not
submit
to
strive
abreast
with
such
comrades
i
would
fold
up
my
banners
and
lead
five
thousand
men
to
seek
not
a
nobler
master
for
the
world
has
none
such
but
wars
in
which
we
might
not
be
obliged
to
blush
for
our
assistants
silence
said
the
duke
and
be
assured
you
serve
a
prince
who
knows
your
worth
too
well
to
exchange
it
for
the
untried
and
untrustful
services
of
those
whom
we
have
only
known
as
vexatious
and
malignant
neighbours
then
addressing
himself
to
arnold
biederman
he
said
coldly
and
sternly
sir
landamman
we
have
heard
you
fairly
we
have
heard
you
although
you
come
before
us
with
hands
dyed
deep
in
the
blood
of
our
servant
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
for
supposing
he
was
murdered
by
a
villanous
association
which
by
george
shall
never
while
we
live
and
reign
raise
its
pestilential
head
on
this
side
of
the
rhine
yet
it
is
not
the
less
undeniable
and
undenied
that
you
stood
by
in
arms
and
encouraged
the
deed
the
assassins
performed
under
your
countenance
return
to
your
mountains
and
be
thankful
that
you
return
in
life
tell
those
who
sent
you
that
i
will
be
presently
on
their
frontiers
a
deputation
of
your
most
notable
persons
who
meet
me
with
halters
round
their
necks
torches
in
their
left
hands
in
their
right
their
swords
held
by
the
point
may
learn
on
what
conditions
we
will
grant
you
peace
then
farewell
peace
and
welcome
war
said
the
landamman
and
be
its
plagues
and
curses
on
the
heads
of
those
who
choose
blood
and
strife
rather
than
peace
and
union
we
will
meet
you
on
our
frontiers
with
our
naked
swords
but
the
hilts
not
their
points
shall
be
in
our
grasp
charles
of
burgundy
flanders
and
lorraine
duke
of
seven
dukedoms
count
of
seventeen
earldoms
i
bid
you
defiance
and
declare
war
against
you
in
the
name
of
the
confederated
cantons
and
such
others
as
shall
adhere
to
them
there
he
said
are
my
letters
of
defiance
the
herald
took
from
arnold
biederman
the
fatal
denunciation
read
it
not
toison
said
the
haughty
duke
let
the
executioner
drag
it
through
the
streets
at
his
horse
tail
and
nail
it
to
the
gibbet
to
show
in
what
account
we
hold
the
paltry
scroll
and
those
who
sent
away
sirs
speaking
to
the
swiss
trudge
back
to
your
wildernesses
with
such
haste
as
your
feet
can
use
when
we
next
meet
you
shall
better
know
whom
you
have
get
our
horse
ready
the
council
is
broken
up
the
maire
of
dijon
when
all
were
in
motion
to
leave
the
hall
again
approached
the
duke
and
timidly
expressed
some
hopes
that
his
highness
would
deign
to
partake
of
a
banquet
which
the
magistracy
had
prepared
in
expectation
he
might
do
them
such
an
honour
no
by
george
of
burgundy
sir
maire
said
charles
with
one
of
the
withering
glances
by
which
he
was
wont
to
express
indignation
mixed
with
contempt
you
have
not
pleased
us
so
well
with
our
breakfast
as
to
induce
us
to
trust
our
dinner
to
the
loyalty
of
our
good
town
of
dijon
so
saying
he
rudely
turned
off
from
the
mortified
chief
magistrate
and
mounting
his
horse
rode
back
to
his
camp
conversing
earnestly
on
the
way
with
the
count
of
i
would
offer
you
dinner
my
lord
of
oxford
said
colvin
to
that
nobleman
when
he
alighted
at
his
tent
but
i
foresee
ere
you
could
swallow
a
mouthful
you
will
be
summoned
to
the
duke
presence
for
it
is
our
charles
way
when
he
has
fixed
on
a
wrong
course
to
wrangle
with
his
friends
and
counsellors
in
order
to
prove
it
is
a
right
one
marry
he
always
makes
a
convert
of
yon
supple
italian
colvin
augury
was
speedily
realised
for
a
page
almost
immediately
summoned
the
english
merchant
philipson
to
attend
the
duke
without
waiting
an
instant
charles
poured
forth
an
incoherent
tide
of
reproaches
against
the
estates
of
his
dukedom
for
refusing
him
their
countenance
in
so
slight
a
matter
and
launched
out
in
explanations
of
the
necessity
which
he
alleged
there
was
for
punishing
the
audacity
of
the
swiss
and
thou
too
oxford
he
concluded
art
such
an
impatient
fool
as
to
wish
me
to
engage
in
a
distant
war
with
england
and
transport
forces
over
the
sea
when
i
have
such
insolent
mutineers
to
chastise
on
my
own
frontiers
when
he
was
at
length
silent
the
english
earl
laid
before
him
with
respectful
earnestness
the
danger
that
appeared
to
be
involved
in
engaging
with
a
people
poor
indeed
but
universally
dreaded
from
their
discipline
and
courage
and
that
under
the
eye
of
so
dangerous
a
rival
as
louis
of
france
who
was
sure
to
support
the
duke
enemies
underhand
if
he
did
not
join
them
openly
on
this
point
the
resolution
was
immovable
it
shall
never
he
said
be
told
of
me
that
i
uttered
threats
which
i
dared
not
execute
these
boors
have
declared
war
against
me
and
they
shall
learn
whose
wrath
it
is
that
they
have
wantonly
provoked
but
i
do
not
therefore
renounce
thy
scheme
my
good
oxford
if
thou
canst
procure
me
this
same
cession
of
provence
and
induce
old
rené
to
give
up
the
cause
of
his
grandson
ferrand
of
vaudemont
in
lorraine
thou
wilt
make
it
well
worth
my
while
to
send
thee
brave
aid
against
my
brother
blackburn
who
while
he
is
drinking
healths
in
france
may
well
come
to
lose
his
lands
in
england
and
be
not
impatient
because
i
can
not
at
this
very
instant
send
men
across
the
seas
the
march
which
i
am
making
towards
neufchatel
which
is
i
think
the
nearest
point
where
i
shall
find
these
churls
will
be
but
like
a
morning
excursion
i
trust
you
will
go
with
us
old
companion
i
should
like
to
see
if
you
have
forgotten
among
yonder
mountains
how
to
back
a
horse
and
lay
a
lance
in
rest
i
will
wait
on
your
highness
said
the
earl
as
is
my
duty
for
my
motions
must
depend
on
your
pleasure
but
i
will
not
carry
arms
especially
against
those
people
of
helvetia
from
whom
i
have
experienced
hospitality
unless
it
be
for
my
own
personal
defence
well
replied
the
duke
be
it
so
we
shall
have
in
you
an
excellent
judge
to
tell
us
who
best
discharges
his
devoir
against
the
mountain
clowns
at
this
point
in
the
conversation
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
entrance
of
the
pavilion
and
the
chancellor
of
burgundy
presently
entered
in
great
haste
and
anxiety
news
my
lord
news
of
france
and
england
said
the
prelate
and
then
observing
the
presence
of
a
stranger
he
looked
at
the
duke
and
was
silent
it
is
a
faithful
friend
my
lord
bishop
said
the
duke
you
may
tell
your
news
before
him
it
will
soon
be
generally
known
said
the
chancellor
louis
and
edward
are
fully
accorded
both
the
duke
and
the
english
earl
started
i
expected
this
said
the
duke
but
not
so
soon
the
kings
have
met
answered
his
minister
how
in
battle
said
oxford
forgetting
himself
in
his
extreme
eagerness
the
chancellor
was
somewhat
surprised
but
as
the
duke
seemed
to
expect
him
to
give
an
answer
he
replied
no
sir
stranger
not
in
battle
but
upon
appointment
and
in
peace
and
amity
the
sight
must
have
been
worth
seeing
said
the
duke
when
the
old
fox
louis
and
my
brother
black
i
mean
my
brother
edward
met
where
held
they
their
rendezvous
on
a
bridge
over
the
seine
at
picquigny
i
would
thou
hadst
been
there
said
the
duke
looking
to
oxford
with
a
good
axe
in
thy
hand
to
strike
one
fair
blow
for
england
and
another
for
burgundy
my
grandfather
was
treacherously
slain
at
just
such
a
meeting
at
the
bridge
of
montereau
upon
the
yonne
to
prevent
a
similar
chance
said
the
chancellor
a
strong
barricade
such
as
closes
the
cages
in
which
men
keep
wild
beasts
was
raised
in
the
midst
of
the
bridge
and
prevented
the
possibility
of
their
even
touching
each
other
hands
ha
ha
by
george
that
smells
of
louis
craft
and
caution
for
the
englishman
to
give
him
his
due
is
as
little
acquainted
with
fear
as
with
policy
but
what
terms
have
they
made
where
do
the
english
army
winter
what
towns
fortresses
and
castles
are
surrendered
to
them
in
pledge
or
in
perpetuity
none
my
liege
said
the
chancellor
the
english
army
returns
into
england
as
fast
as
shipping
can
be
procured
to
transport
them
and
louis
will
accommodate
them
with
every
sail
and
oar
in
his
dominions
rather
than
they
should
not
instantly
evacuate
france
and
by
what
concessions
has
louis
bought
a
peace
so
necessary
to
his
affairs
by
fair
words
said
the
chancellor
by
liberal
presents
and
by
some
five
hundred
tuns
of
wine
wine
exclaimed
the
duke
heardst
thou
ever
the
like
seignor
philipson
why
your
countrymen
are
little
better
than
esau
who
sold
his
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
marry
i
must
confess
i
never
saw
an
englishman
who
loved
a
bargain
i
can
scarce
believe
this
news
said
the
earl
of
oxford
if
this
edward
were
content
to
cross
the
sea
with
fifty
thousand
englishmen
merely
to
return
again
there
are
in
his
camp
both
proud
nobles
and
haughty
commons
enough
to
resist
his
disgraceful
purpose
the
money
of
louis
said
the
statesman
has
found
noble
hands
willing
to
clutch
it
the
wine
of
france
has
flooded
every
throat
in
the
english
army
the
riot
and
uproar
was
unbounded
and
at
one
time
the
town
of
amiens
where
louis
himself
resided
was
full
of
so
many
english
archers
all
of
them
intoxicated
that
the
person
of
the
king
of
france
was
almost
in
their
hands
their
sense
of
national
honour
has
been
lost
in
the
universal
revel
and
those
amongst
them
who
would
be
more
dignified
and
play
the
wise
politicians
say
that
having
come
to
france
by
connivance
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
that
prince
having
failed
to
join
them
with
his
forces
they
have
done
well
wisely
and
gallantly
considering
the
season
of
the
year
and
the
impossibility
of
obtaining
quarters
to
take
tribute
of
france
and
return
home
in
triumph
and
leave
louis
said
oxford
at
undisturbed
freedom
to
attack
burgundy
with
all
his
forces
not
so
friend
philipson
said
duke
charles
know
that
there
is
a
truce
betwixt
burgundy
and
france
for
the
space
of
seven
years
and
had
not
this
been
granted
and
signed
it
is
probable
that
we
might
have
found
some
means
of
marring
the
treaty
betwixt
edward
and
louis
even
at
the
expense
of
affording
those
voracious
islanders
beef
and
beer
during
the
winter
sir
chancellor
you
may
leave
us
but
be
within
reach
of
a
hasty
summons
when
his
minister
left
the
pavilion
the
duke
who
with
his
rude
and
imperious
character
united
much
kindness
if
it
could
not
be
termed
generosity
of
disposition
came
up
to
the
lancastrian
lord
who
stood
like
one
at
whose
feet
a
thunderbolt
has
just
broken
and
who
is
still
appalled
by
the
terrors
of
the
shock
my
poor
oxford
he
said
thou
art
stupefied
by
this
news
which
thou
canst
not
doubt
must
have
a
fatal
effect
on
the
plan
which
thy
brave
bosom
cherishes
with
such
devoted
fidelity
i
would
for
thy
sake
i
could
have
detained
the
english
a
little
longer
in
france
but
had
i
attempted
to
do
so
there
were
an
end
of
my
truce
with
louis
and
of
course
to
my
power
to
chastise
these
paltry
cantons
or
send
forth
an
expedition
to
england
as
matters
stand
give
me
but
a
week
to
punish
these
mountaineers
and
you
shall
have
a
larger
force
than
your
modesty
has
requested
of
me
for
your
enterprise
and
in
the
meanwhile
i
will
take
care
that
blackburn
and
his
have
no
assistance
of
shipping
from
flanders
tush
man
never
fear
it
thou
wilt
be
in
england
long
ere
they
and
once
more
rely
on
my
assistance
always
thou
knowest
the
cession
of
provence
being
executed
as
in
reason
our
cousin
margaret
diamonds
we
must
keep
for
a
time
and
perhaps
they
may
pass
as
a
pledge
with
some
of
our
own
for
the
godly
purpose
of
setting
at
freedom
the
imprisoned
angels
of
our
flemish
usurers
who
will
not
lend
even
to
their
sovereign
unless
on
good
current
security
to
such
straits
has
the
disobedient
avarice
of
our
estates
for
the
moment
reduced
us
alas
my
lord
said
the
dejected
nobleman
i
were
ungrateful
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
your
good
intentions
but
who
can
presume
on
the
events
of
war
especially
when
time
presses
for
instant
decision
you
are
pleased
to
trust
me
let
your
highness
extend
your
confidence
thus
far
i
will
take
my
horse
and
ride
after
the
landamman
if
he
hath
already
set
forth
i
have
little
doubt
to
make
such
an
accommodation
with
him
that
you
may
be
secure
on
all
your
frontiers
you
may
then
with
security
work
your
will
in
lorraine
and
provence
do
not
speak
of
it
said
the
duke
sharply
thou
thyself
and
me
when
thou
supposest
that
a
prince
who
has
pledged
his
word
to
his
people
can
recall
it
like
a
merchant
chaffering
for
his
paltry
wares
go
to
we
will
assist
you
but
we
will
be
ourselves
judge
of
the
time
and
manner
yet
having
both
kind
will
to
our
distressed
cousin
of
anjou
and
being
your
good
friend
we
will
not
linger
in
the
matter
our
host
have
orders
to
break
up
this
evening
and
direct
their
march
against
neufchatel
where
these
proud
swiss
shall
have
a
taste
of
the
fire
and
sword
which
they
have
provoked
oxford
sighed
deeply
but
made
no
further
remonstrance
in
which
he
acted
wisely
since
it
was
likely
to
have
exasperated
the
fiery
temper
of
the
sovereign
to
whom
it
was
addressed
while
it
was
certain
that
it
would
not
in
the
slightest
degree
alter
his
resolution
he
took
farewell
of
the
duke
and
returned
to
colvin
whom
he
found
immersed
in
the
business
of
his
department
and
preparing
for
the
removal
of
the
artillery
an
operation
which
the
clumsiness
of
the
ordnance
and
the
execrable
state
of
the
roads
rendered
at
that
time
a
much
more
troublesome
operation
than
at
present
though
it
is
even
still
one
of
the
most
laborious
movements
attending
the
march
of
an
army
the
master
of
the
ordnance
welcomed
oxford
with
much
glee
and
congratulated
himself
on
the
distinguished
honour
of
enjoying
his
company
during
the
campaign
and
acquainted
him
that
by
the
especial
command
of
the
duke
he
had
made
fitting
preparations
for
his
accommodation
suitable
to
the
disguised
character
which
he
meant
to
maintain
but
in
every
other
respect
as
convenient
as
a
camp
could
admit
of
chapter
xi
a
mirthful
man
he
was
the
snows
of
age
fell
but
they
did
not
chill
him
gaiety
even
in
life
closing
touch
his
teeming
brain
with
such
wild
visions
as
the
setting
sun
raises
in
front
of
some
hoar
glacier
painting
the
bleak
ice
with
a
thousand
hues
leaving
the
earl
of
oxford
in
attendance
on
the
stubborn
duke
of
burgundy
during
an
expedition
which
the
one
represented
as
a
brief
excursion
more
resembling
a
than
a
campaign
and
which
the
other
considered
in
a
much
graver
and
more
perilous
light
we
return
to
arthur
de
vere
or
the
younger
philipson
as
he
continued
to
be
called
who
was
conducted
by
his
guide
with
fidelity
and
success
but
certainly
very
slowly
upon
his
journey
into
provence
the
state
of
lorraine
overrun
by
the
duke
of
burgundy
army
and
infested
at
the
same
time
by
different
scattered
bands
who
took
the
field
or
held
out
the
castles
as
they
alleged
for
the
interest
of
count
ferrand
de
vaudemont
rendered
journeying
so
dangerous
that
it
was
often
necessary
to
leave
the
main
road
and
to
take
circuitous
tracks
in
order
to
avoid
such
unfriendly
encounters
as
travellers
might
otherwise
have
met
with
arthur
taught
by
sad
experience
to
distrust
strange
guides
found
himself
nevertheless
in
this
eventful
and
perilous
journey
disposed
to
rest
considerable
confidence
in
his
present
conductor
thiebault
a
provençal
by
birth
intimately
acquainted
with
the
roads
which
they
took
and
as
far
as
he
could
judge
disposed
to
discharge
his
office
with
fidelity
prudence
alike
and
the
habits
which
he
had
acquired
in
travelling
as
well
as
the
character
of
a
merchant
which
he
still
sustained
induced
him
to
wave
the
or
haughty
superiority
of
a
knight
and
noble
towards
an
inferior
personage
especially
as
he
rightly
conjectured
that
free
intercourse
with
this
man
whose
acquirements
seemed
of
a
superior
cast
was
likely
to
render
him
a
judge
of
his
opinions
and
disposition
towards
him
in
return
for
his
condescension
he
obtained
a
good
deal
of
information
concerning
the
province
which
he
was
approaching
as
they
drew
near
the
boundaries
of
provence
the
communications
of
thiebault
became
more
fluent
and
interesting
he
could
not
only
tell
the
name
and
history
of
each
romantic
castle
which
they
passed
in
their
devious
and
doubtful
route
but
had
at
his
command
the
chivalrous
history
of
the
noble
knights
and
barons
to
whom
they
now
pertained
or
had
belonged
in
earlier
days
and
could
recount
their
exploits
against
the
saracens
by
repelling
their
attacks
upon
christendom
or
their
efforts
to
recover
the
holy
sepulchre
from
pagan
hands
in
the
course
of
such
narrations
thiebault
was
led
to
speak
of
the
troubadours
a
race
of
native
poets
of
provençal
origin
differing
widely
from
the
minstrels
of
normandy
and
the
adjacent
provinces
of
france
with
whose
tales
of
chivalry
as
well
as
the
numerous
translations
of
their
works
into
and
english
arthur
like
most
of
the
noble
youth
of
his
country
was
intimately
acquainted
and
deeply
imbued
thiebault
boasted
that
his
grandsire
of
humble
birth
indeed
but
of
distinguished
talent
was
one
of
this
gifted
race
whose
compositions
produced
so
great
an
effect
on
the
temper
and
manners
of
their
age
and
country
it
was
however
to
be
regretted
that
inculcating
as
the
prime
duty
of
life
a
fantastic
spirit
of
gallantry
which
sometimes
crossed
the
platonic
bound
prescribed
to
it
the
poetry
of
the
troubadours
was
too
frequently
used
to
soften
and
seduce
the
heart
and
corrupt
the
principles
arthur
attention
was
called
to
this
peculiarity
by
thiebault
singing
which
he
could
do
with
good
skill
the
history
of
a
troubadour
named
william
cabestainy
who
loved
a
noble
and
beautiful
lady
margaret
the
wife
of
a
baron
called
raymond
de
roussillon
the
jealous
husband
obtained
proof
of
his
dishonour
and
having
put
cabestainy
to
death
by
assassination
he
took
his
heart
from
his
bosom
and
causing
it
to
be
dressed
like
that
of
an
animal
ordered
it
to
be
served
up
to
his
lady
and
when
she
had
eaten
of
the
horrible
mess
told
her
of
what
her
banquet
was
composed
the
lady
replied
that
since
she
had
been
made
to
partake
of
food
so
precious
no
coarser
morsel
should
ever
after
cross
her
lips
she
persisted
in
her
resolution
and
thus
starved
herself
to
death
the
troubadour
who
celebrated
this
tragic
history
had
displayed
in
his
composition
a
good
deal
of
poetic
art
glossing
over
the
error
of
the
lovers
as
the
fault
of
their
destiny
dwelling
on
their
tragical
fate
with
considerable
pathos
and
finally
execrating
the
blind
fury
of
the
husband
with
the
full
fervour
of
poetical
indignation
he
recorded
with
vindictive
pleasure
how
every
bold
knight
and
true
lover
in
the
south
of
france
assembled
to
besiege
the
baron
castle
stormed
it
by
main
force
left
not
one
stone
upon
another
and
put
the
tyrant
himself
to
an
ignominious
death
arthur
was
interested
in
the
melancholy
tale
which
even
beguiled
him
of
a
few
tears
but
as
he
thought
further
on
its
purport
he
dried
his
eyes
and
said
with
some
sternness
thiebault
sing
me
no
more
such
lays
i
have
heard
my
father
say
that
the
readiest
mode
to
corrupt
a
christian
man
is
to
bestow
upon
vice
the
pity
and
the
praise
which
are
due
only
to
virtue
your
baron
of
roussillon
is
a
monster
of
cruelty
but
your
unfortunate
lovers
were
not
the
less
guilty
it
is
by
giving
fair
names
to
foul
actions
that
those
who
would
start
at
real
vice
are
led
to
practise
its
lessons
under
the
disguise
of
virtue
i
would
you
knew
seignor
answered
thiebault
that
this
lay
of
cabestainy
and
the
lady
margaret
of
roussillon
is
reckoned
a
masterpiece
of
the
joyous
science
fie
sir
you
are
too
young
to
be
so
strict
a
censor
of
morals
what
will
you
do
when
your
head
is
grey
if
you
are
thus
severe
when
it
is
scarcely
brown
a
head
which
listens
to
folly
in
youth
will
hardly
be
honourable
in
old
age
answered
arthur
thiebault
had
no
mind
to
carry
the
dispute
further
it
is
not
for
me
to
contend
with
your
worship
i
only
think
with
every
true
son
of
chivalry
and
song
that
a
knight
without
a
mistress
is
like
a
sky
without
a
star
do
i
not
know
that
answered
arthur
but
yet
better
remain
in
darkness
than
be
guided
by
such
false
lights
as
shower
down
vice
and
pestilence
nay
it
may
be
your
seignorie
is
right
answered
the
guide
it
is
certain
that
even
in
provence
here
we
have
lost
much
of
our
keen
judgment
on
matters
of
love
its
difficulties
its
intricacies
and
its
errors
since
the
troubadours
are
no
longer
regarded
as
usual
and
since
the
high
and
noble
parliament
of
love
has
ceased
to
hold
its
sittings
but
in
these
latter
days
continued
the
provençal
kings
dukes
and
sovereigns
instead
of
being
the
foremost
and
most
faithful
vassals
of
the
court
of
cupid
are
themselves
the
slaves
of
selfishness
and
love
of
gain
instead
of
winning
hearts
by
breaking
lances
in
the
lists
they
are
breaking
the
hearts
of
their
impoverished
vassals
by
the
most
cruel
exactions
instead
of
attempting
to
deserve
the
smile
and
favours
of
their
they
are
meditating
how
to
steal
castles
towns
and
provinces
from
their
neighbours
but
long
life
to
the
good
and
venerable
king
rené
while
he
has
an
acre
of
land
left
his
residence
will
be
the
resort
of
valiant
knights
whose
only
aim
is
praise
in
arms
of
true
lovers
who
are
persecuted
by
fortune
and
of
harpers
who
know
how
to
celebrate
faith
and
valour
arthur
interested
in
learning
something
more
precise
than
common
fame
had
taught
him
on
the
subject
of
this
prince
easily
induced
the
talkative
provençal
to
enlarge
upon
the
virtues
of
his
old
character
as
just
joyous
and
debonair
a
friend
to
the
most
noble
exercises
of
the
chase
and
the
and
still
more
so
to
the
joyous
science
of
poetry
and
music
who
gave
away
more
revenue
than
he
received
in
largesses
to
and
itinerant
musicians
with
whom
his
petty
court
was
crowded
as
one
of
the
very
few
in
which
the
ancient
hospitality
was
still
maintained
such
was
the
picture
which
thiebault
drew
of
the
last
minstrel
monarch
and
though
the
eulogium
was
exaggerated
perhaps
the
facts
were
not
overcharged
born
of
royal
parentage
and
with
high
pretensions
rené
had
at
no
period
of
his
life
been
able
to
match
his
fortunes
to
his
claims
of
the
kingdoms
to
which
he
asserted
right
nothing
remained
in
his
possession
but
the
county
of
provence
itself
a
fair
and
friendly
principality
but
diminished
by
the
many
claims
which
france
had
acquired
upon
portions
of
it
by
advances
of
money
to
supply
the
personal
expenses
of
its
master
and
by
other
portions
which
burgundy
to
whom
rené
had
been
a
prisoner
held
in
pledge
for
his
ransom
in
his
youth
he
engaged
in
more
than
one
military
enterprise
in
the
hope
of
attaining
some
part
of
the
territory
of
which
he
was
styled
sovereign
his
courage
is
not
impeached
but
fortune
did
not
smile
on
his
military
adventures
and
he
seems
at
last
to
have
become
sensible
that
the
power
of
admiring
and
celebrating
warlike
merit
is
very
different
from
possessing
that
quality
in
fact
rené
was
a
prince
of
very
moderate
parts
endowed
with
a
love
of
the
fine
arts
which
he
carried
to
extremity
and
a
degree
of
which
never
permitted
him
to
repine
at
fortune
but
rendered
its
possessor
happy
when
a
prince
of
keener
feelings
would
have
died
of
despair
this
insouciant
gay
and
thoughtless
disposition
conducted
rené
free
from
all
the
passions
which
embitter
life
and
often
shorten
it
to
a
hale
and
mirthful
old
age
even
domestic
losses
which
often
affect
those
who
are
proof
against
mere
reverses
of
fortune
made
no
deep
impression
on
the
feelings
of
this
cheerful
old
monarch
most
of
his
children
had
died
young
rené
took
it
not
to
heart
his
daughter
margaret
marriage
with
the
powerful
henry
of
england
was
considered
a
connection
much
above
the
fortunes
of
the
king
of
the
troubadours
but
in
the
issue
instead
of
rené
deriving
any
splendour
from
the
match
he
was
involved
in
the
misfortunes
of
his
daughter
and
repeatedly
obliged
to
impoverish
himself
to
supply
her
ransom
perhaps
in
his
private
soul
the
old
king
did
not
think
these
losses
so
mortifying
as
the
necessity
of
receiving
margaret
into
his
court
and
family
on
fire
when
reflecting
on
the
losses
she
had
sustained
mourning
over
friends
slain
and
kingdoms
lost
the
proudest
and
most
passionate
of
princesses
was
ill
suited
to
dwell
with
the
gayest
and
of
sovereigns
whose
pursuits
she
contemned
and
whose
lightness
of
temper
for
finding
comfort
in
such
trifles
she
could
not
forgive
the
discomfort
attached
to
her
presence
and
vindictive
recollections
embarrassed
the
old
monarch
though
it
was
unable
to
drive
him
beyond
his
equanimity
another
distress
pressed
him
more
yolande
a
daughter
of
his
first
wife
isabella
had
succeeded
to
his
claims
upon
the
duchy
of
lorraine
and
transmitted
them
to
her
son
ferrand
count
of
vaudemont
a
young
man
of
courage
and
spirit
engaged
at
this
time
in
the
apparently
desperate
undertaking
of
making
his
title
good
against
the
duke
of
burgundy
who
with
little
right
but
great
power
was
seizing
upon
and
overrunning
this
rich
duchy
which
he
laid
claim
to
as
a
male
fief
and
to
conclude
while
the
aged
king
on
one
side
beheld
his
dethroned
daughter
in
hopeless
despair
and
on
the
other
his
disinherited
grandson
in
vain
attempting
to
recover
part
of
their
rights
he
had
the
additional
misfortune
to
know
that
his
nephew
louis
of
france
and
his
cousin
the
duke
of
burgundy
were
secretly
contending
which
should
succeed
him
in
that
portion
of
provence
which
he
still
continued
to
possess
and
that
it
was
only
jealousy
of
each
other
which
prevented
his
being
despoiled
of
this
last
remnant
of
his
territory
yet
amid
all
this
distress
rené
feasted
and
received
guests
danced
sang
composed
poetry
used
the
pencil
or
brush
with
no
small
skill
devised
and
conducted
festivals
and
processions
and
studying
to
promote
as
far
as
possible
the
immediate
mirth
and
of
his
subjects
if
he
could
not
materially
enlarge
their
more
permanent
prosperity
was
never
mentioned
by
them
excepting
as
bon
roi
a
distinction
conferred
on
him
down
to
the
present
day
and
due
to
him
certainly
by
the
qualities
of
his
heart
if
not
by
those
of
his
head
whilst
arthur
was
receiving
from
his
guide
a
full
account
of
the
peculiarities
of
king
rené
they
entered
the
territories
of
that
merry
monarch
it
was
late
in
the
autumn
and
about
the
period
when
the
counties
of
france
rather
show
to
least
advantage
the
foliage
of
the
is
then
decayed
and
withered
and
as
it
predominates
in
the
landscape
and
resembles
the
scorched
complexion
of
the
soil
itself
an
ashen
and
arid
hue
is
given
to
the
whole
still
however
there
were
scenes
in
the
hilly
and
pastoral
parts
of
the
country
where
the
quantity
of
evergreens
relieved
the
eye
even
in
this
dead
season
the
appearance
of
the
country
in
general
had
much
in
it
that
was
peculiar
the
travellers
perceived
at
every
turn
some
marks
of
the
singular
character
provence
as
the
part
of
gaul
which
first
received
roman
civilisation
and
as
having
been
still
longer
the
residence
of
the
grecian
colony
who
founded
marseilles
is
more
full
of
the
splendid
relics
of
ancient
architecture
than
any
other
country
in
europe
italy
and
greece
excepted
the
good
taste
of
the
king
rené
had
dictated
some
attempts
to
clear
out
and
to
restore
these
memorials
of
antiquity
was
there
a
triumphal
arch
or
an
ancient
temple
huts
and
hovels
were
cleared
away
from
its
vicinity
and
means
were
used
at
least
to
retard
the
approach
of
ruin
was
there
a
marble
fountain
which
superstition
had
dedicated
to
some
sequestered
naiad
it
was
surrounded
by
olives
almond
and
orange
trees
its
cistern
was
repaired
and
taught
once
more
to
retain
its
crystal
treasures
the
huge
amphitheatres
and
gigantic
colonnades
experienced
the
same
anxious
care
attesting
that
the
noblest
specimens
of
the
fine
arts
found
one
admirer
and
preserver
in
king
rené
even
during
the
course
of
those
which
are
termed
the
dark
and
barbarous
ages
a
change
of
manners
could
also
be
observed
in
passing
from
burgundy
and
lorraine
where
society
relished
of
german
bluntness
into
the
pastoral
country
of
provence
where
the
influence
of
a
fine
climate
and
melodious
language
joined
to
the
pursuits
of
the
romantic
old
monarch
with
the
universal
taste
for
music
and
poetry
had
introduced
a
civilisation
of
manners
which
approached
to
affectation
the
shepherd
literally
marched
abroad
in
the
morning
piping
his
flocks
forth
to
the
pasture
with
some
the
composition
of
an
amorous
troubadour
and
his
fleecy
care
seemed
actually
to
be
under
the
influence
of
his
music
instead
of
being
ungraciously
insensible
to
its
melody
as
is
the
case
in
colder
climates
arthur
observed
too
that
the
provençal
sheep
instead
of
being
driven
before
the
shepherd
regularly
followed
him
and
did
not
disperse
to
feed
until
the
swain
by
turning
his
face
round
to
them
remaining
stationary
and
executing
variations
on
the
air
which
he
was
playing
seemed
to
remind
them
that
it
was
proper
to
do
so
while
in
motion
his
huge
dog
of
a
species
which
is
trained
to
face
the
wolf
and
who
is
respected
by
the
sheep
as
their
guardian
and
not
feared
as
their
tyrant
followed
his
master
with
his
ears
pricked
like
the
chief
critic
and
prime
judge
of
the
performance
at
some
tones
of
which
he
seldom
failed
to
intimate
disapprobation
while
the
flock
like
the
generality
of
an
audience
followed
in
unanimous
though
silent
applause
at
the
hour
of
noon
the
shepherd
had
sometimes
acquired
an
augmentation
to
his
audience
in
some
comely
matron
or
blooming
maiden
with
whom
he
had
rendezvoused
by
such
a
fountain
as
we
have
described
and
who
listened
to
the
husband
or
lover
chalumeau
or
mingled
her
voice
with
his
in
the
duets
of
which
the
songs
of
the
troubadours
have
left
so
many
examples
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
the
dance
on
the
village
green
or
the
concert
before
the
hamlet
door
the
little
repast
of
fruits
cheese
and
bread
which
the
traveller
was
readily
invited
to
share
gave
new
charms
to
the
illusion
and
seemed
in
earnest
to
point
out
provence
as
the
arcadia
of
france
but
the
greatest
singularity
was
in
the
eyes
of
arthur
the
total
absence
of
armed
men
and
soldiers
in
this
peaceful
country
in
england
no
man
stirred
without
his
sword
and
buckler
in
france
the
hind
wore
armour
even
when
he
was
betwixt
the
stilts
of
his
plough
in
germany
you
could
not
look
along
a
mile
of
highway
but
the
eye
was
encountered
by
clouds
of
dust
out
of
which
were
seen
by
fits
waving
feathers
and
flashing
armour
even
in
switzerland
the
peasant
if
he
had
a
journey
to
make
though
but
of
a
mile
or
two
cared
not
to
travel
without
his
halberd
and
sword
but
in
provence
all
seemed
quiet
and
peaceful
as
if
the
music
of
the
land
had
lulled
to
sleep
all
its
wrathful
passions
now
and
then
a
mounted
cavalier
might
pass
them
the
harp
at
whose
or
carried
by
one
of
his
attendants
attested
the
character
of
a
troubadour
which
was
affected
by
men
of
all
ranks
and
then
only
a
short
sword
on
his
left
thigh
borne
for
show
rather
than
use
was
a
necessary
and
appropriate
part
of
his
equipment
peace
said
arthur
as
he
looked
around
him
is
an
inestimable
jewel
but
it
will
be
soon
snatched
from
those
who
are
not
prepared
with
heart
and
hand
to
defend
it
the
sight
of
the
ancient
and
interesting
town
of
aix
where
king
rené
held
his
court
dispelled
reflections
of
a
general
character
and
recalled
to
the
young
englishman
the
peculiar
mission
on
which
he
was
engaged
he
then
required
to
know
from
the
provençal
thiebault
whether
his
instructions
were
to
leave
him
now
that
he
had
successfully
attained
the
end
of
his
journey
my
instructions
answered
thiebault
are
to
remain
in
aix
while
there
is
any
chance
of
your
seignorie
continuing
there
to
be
of
such
use
to
you
as
you
may
require
either
as
a
guide
or
an
attendant
and
to
keep
these
men
in
readiness
to
wait
upon
you
when
you
have
occasion
for
messengers
or
guards
with
your
approbation
i
will
see
them
disposed
of
in
fitting
quarters
and
receive
my
further
instructions
from
your
seignorie
wherever
you
please
to
appoint
me
i
propose
this
separation
because
i
understand
it
is
your
present
pleasure
to
be
private
i
must
go
to
court
answered
arthur
without
any
delay
wait
for
me
in
half
an
hour
by
that
fountain
in
the
street
which
projects
into
the
air
such
a
magnificent
pillar
of
water
surrounded
i
would
almost
swear
by
a
vapour
like
steam
serving
as
a
shroud
to
the
jet
which
it
envelopes
the
jet
is
so
surrounded
answered
the
provençal
because
it
is
supplied
by
a
hot
spring
rising
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
the
touch
of
frost
on
this
autumn
morning
makes
the
vapour
more
distinguishable
than
but
if
it
is
good
king
rené
whom
you
seek
you
will
find
him
at
this
time
walking
in
his
chimney
do
not
be
afraid
of
approaching
him
for
there
never
was
a
monarch
so
easy
of
access
especially
to
strangers
like
you
seignorie
but
his
ushers
said
arthur
will
not
admit
me
into
his
hall
his
hall
repeated
thiebault
whose
hall
why
king
rené
i
apprehend
if
he
is
walking
in
a
chimney
it
can
only
be
in
that
of
his
hall
and
a
stately
one
it
must
be
to
give
him
room
for
such
exercise
you
mistake
my
meaning
said
the
guide
laughing
what
we
call
king
rené
chimney
is
the
narrow
parapet
yonder
it
extends
between
these
two
towers
has
an
exposure
to
the
south
and
is
sheltered
in
every
other
direction
yonder
it
is
his
pleasure
to
walk
and
enjoy
the
beams
of
the
sun
on
such
cool
mornings
as
the
present
it
nurses
he
says
his
poetical
vein
if
you
approach
his
promenade
he
will
readily
speak
to
you
unless
indeed
he
is
in
the
very
act
of
a
poetical
composition
arthur
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
the
thoughts
of
a
king
eighty
years
of
age
broken
down
with
misfortunes
and
beset
with
dangers
who
yet
amused
himself
with
walking
in
an
open
parapet
and
composing
poetry
in
presence
of
all
such
of
his
loving
subjects
as
chose
to
look
on
if
you
will
walk
a
few
steps
this
way
said
thiebault
you
may
see
the
good
king
and
judge
whether
or
not
you
will
accost
him
at
present
i
will
dispose
of
the
people
and
await
your
orders
at
the
fountain
in
the
corso
arthur
saw
no
objection
to
the
proposal
of
his
guide
and
was
not
unwilling
to
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
something
of
the
good
king
rené
before
he
was
introduced
to
his
presence

of

is
described
by

as
bearing
the
style
of
king
of
naples
of
both
the
sicilies
and
jerusalem
yet
not
so
wealthy
as
an
english
yeoman
gave
arthur
the
perfect
survey
of
his
majesty
in
person
he
saw
an
old
man
with
locks
and
beard
which
in
amplitude
and
whiteness
nearly
rivalled
those
of
the
envoy
from
schwitz
but
with
a
fresh
and
ruddy
colour
in
his
cheek
and
an
eye
of
great
vivacity
his
dress
was
showy
to
a
degree
almost
inconsistent
with
his
years
and
his
step
not
only
firm
but
full
of
alertness
and
vivacity
while
occupied
in
traversing
the
short
and
sheltered
walk
which
he
had
chosen
rather
for
comfort
than
for
privacy
showed
juvenile
vigour
still
animating
an
aged
frame
the
old
king
carried
his
tablets
and
a
pencil
in
his
hand
seeming
totally
abstracted
in
his
own
thoughts
and
indifferent
to
being
observed
by
several
persons
from
the
public
street
beneath
his
elevated
promenade
of
these
some
from
their
dress
and
manner
seemed
themselves
troubadours
for
they
held
in
their
hands
rebecks
rotes
small
portable
harps
and
other
indications
of
their
profession
such
appeared
to
be
stationary
as
if
engaged
in
observing
and
recording
their
remarks
on
the
meditations
of
their
prince
other
passengers
bent
on
their
own
more
serious
affairs
looked
up
to
the
king
as
to
some
one
whom
they
were
accustomed
to
see
daily
but
never
passed
without
doffing
their
bonnets
and
expressing
by
a
suitable
obeisance
a
respect
and
affection
towards
his
person
which
appeared
to
make
up
in
cordiality
of
feeling
what
it
wanted
in
deep
and
solemn
deference
rené
in
the
meanwhile
was
apparently
unconscious
both
of
the
gaze
of
such
as
stood
still
or
the
greeting
of
those
who
passed
on
his
mind
seeming
altogether
engrossed
with
the
apparent
labour
of
some
arduous
task
in
poetry
or
music
he
walked
fast
or
slow
as
best
suited
the
progress
of
composition
at
times
he
stopped
to
mark
hastily
down
on
his
tablets
something
which
seemed
to
occur
to
him
as
deserving
of
preservation
at
other
times
he
dashed
out
what
he
had
written
and
flung
down
the
pencil
as
if
in
a
sort
of
despair
on
these
occasions
the
sibylline
leaf
was
carefully
picked
up
by
a
beautiful
page
his
only
attendant
who
reverently
observed
the
first
suitable
opportunity
of
restoring
it
again
to
his
royal
hand
the
same
youth
bore
a
viol
on
which
at
a
signal
from
his
master
he
occasionally
struck
a
few
musical
notes
to
which
the
old
king
listened
now
with
a
soothed
and
satisfied
air
now
with
a
discontented
and
anxious
brow
at
times
his
enthusiasm
rose
so
high
that
he
even
hopped
and
skipped
with
an
activity
which
his
years
did
not
promise
at
other
times
his
motions
were
extremely
slow
and
occasionally
he
stood
still
like
one
wrapped
in
the
deepest
and
most
anxious
meditation
when
he
chanced
to
look
on
the
group
which
seemed
to
watch
his
motions
and
who
ventured
even
to
salute
him
with
a
murmur
of
applause
it
was
only
to
distinguish
them
with
a
friendly
and
nod
a
salutation
with
which
likewise
he
failed
not
to
reply
to
the
greeting
of
the
occasional
passengers
when
his
earnest
attention
to
his
task
whatever
it
might
be
permitted
him
to
observe
them
at
length
the
royal
eye
lighted
upon
arthur
whose
attitude
of
silent
observation
and
the
distinction
of
his
figure
pointed
him
out
as
a
stranger
rené
beckoned
to
his
page
who
receiving
his
commands
in
a
whisper
descended
from
the
royal
chimney
to
the
broader
platform
beneath
which
was
open
to
general
resort
the
youth
addressing
arthur
with
much
courtesy
informed
him
the
king
desired
to
speak
with
him
the
young
englishman
had
no
alternative
but
that
of
approaching
though
pondering
much
in
his
own
mind
how
he
ought
to
comport
himself
towards
such
a
singular
specimen
of
royalty
when
he
drew
near
king
rené
addressed
him
in
a
tone
of
courtesy
not
unmingled
with
dignity
and
arthur
awe
in
his
immediate
presence
was
greater
than
he
himself
could
have
anticipated
from
his
previous
conception
of
the
royal
character
you
are
from
your
appearance
fair
sir
said
king
rené
a
stranger
in
this
country
by
what
name
must
we
call
you
and
to
what
business
are
we
to
ascribe
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
at
our
court
arthur
remained
a
moment
silent
and
the
good
old
man
imputing
it
to
awe
and
timidity
proceeded
in
an
encouraging
tone
modesty
in
youth
is
ever
commendable
you
are
doubtless
an
acolyte
in
the
noble
and
joyous
science
of
minstrelsy
and
music
drawn
hither
by
the
willing
welcome
which
we
afford
to
the
professors
of
those
arts
in
which
praise
be
to
our
lady
and
the
saints
we
have
ourself
been
deemed
a
proficient
i
do
not
aspire
to
the
honours
of
a
troubadour
answered
arthur
i
believe
you
answered
the
king
for
your
speech
smacks
of
the
northern
or
such
as
is
spoken
in
england
and
other
unrefined
nations
but
you
are
a
minstrel
perhaps
from
these
ultramontane
parts
be
assured
we
despise
not
their
efforts
for
we
have
listened
not
without
pleasure
and
instruction
to
many
of
their
bold
and
wild
romaunts
which
though
rude
in
device
and
language
and
therefore
far
inferior
to
the
regulated
poetry
of
our
troubadours
have
yet
something
in
their
powerful
and
rough
measure
which
occasionally
rouses
the
heart
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
i
have
felt
the
truth
of
your
grace
observation
when
i
have
heard
the
songs
of
my
country
said
arthur
but
i
have
neither
skill
nor
audacity
to
imitate
what
i
admire
my
latest
residence
has
been
in
italy
you
are
perhaps
then
a
proficient
in
painting
said
rené
an
art
which
applies
itself
to
the
eye
as
poetry
and
music
do
to
the
ear
and
is
scarce
less
in
esteem
with
us
if
you
are
skilful
in
the
art
you
have
come
to
a
monarch
who
loves
it
and
the
fair
country
in
which
it
is
practised
in
simple
truth
sire
i
am
an
englishman
and
my
hand
has
been
too
much
welk
and
hardened
by
practice
of
the
bow
the
lance
and
the
sword
to
touch
the
harp
or
even
the
pencil
an
englishman
said
rené
obviously
relaxing
in
the
warmth
of
his
welcome
and
what
brings
you
here
england
and
i
have
long
had
little
friendship
together
it
is
even
on
that
account
that
i
am
here
said
arthur
i
come
to
pay
my
homage
to
your
grace
daughter
the
princess
margaret
of
anjou
whom
i
and
many
true
englishmen
regard
still
as
our
queen
though
traitors
have
usurped
her
title
alas
good
youth
said
rené
i
must
grieve
for
you
while
i
respect
your
loyalty
and
faith
had
my
daughter
margaret
been
of
my
mind
she
had
long
since
abandoned
pretensions
which
have
drowned
in
seas
of
blood
the
noblest
and
bravest
of
her
adherents
the
king
seemed
about
to
say
more
but
checked
himself
go
to
my
palace
he
said
inquire
for
the
seneschal
hugh
de
saint
cyr
he
will
give
thee
the
means
of
seeing
margaret
that
is
if
it
be
her
will
to
see
thee
if
not
good
english
youth
return
to
my
palace
and
thou
shalt
have
hospitable
entertainment
for
a
king
who
loves
minstrelsy
music
and
painting
is
ever
most
sensible
to
the
claims
of
honour
virtue
and
loyalty
and
i
read
in
thy
looks
thou
art
possessed
of
these
qualities
and
willingly
believe
thou
mayst
in
more
quiet
times
aspire
to
share
the
honours
of
the
joyous
science
but
if
thou
hast
a
heart
to
be
touched
by
the
sense
of
beauty
and
fair
proportion
it
will
leap
within
thee
at
the
first
sight
of
my
palace
the
stately
grace
of
which
may
be
compared
to
the
faultless
form
of
some
dame
or
the
artful
yet
seemingly
simple
modulations
of
such
a
tune
as
we
have
been
now
composing
the
king
seemed
disposed
to
take
his
instrument
and
indulge
the
youth
with
a
rehearsal
of
the
strain
he
had
just
arranged
but
arthur
at
that
moment
experienced
the
painful
internal
feeling
of
that
peculiar
species
of
shame
which
minds
feel
when
they
see
others
express
a
great
assumption
of
importance
with
a
confidence
that
they
are
exciting
admiration
when
in
fact
they
are
only
exposing
themselves
to
ridicule
arthur
in
short
took
leave
in
very
shame
of
the
king
of
naples
both
the
sicilies
and
jerusalem
in
a
manner
somewhat
more
abrupt
than
ceremony
demanded
the
king
looked
after
him
with
some
wonder
at
this
want
of
breeding
which
however
he
imputed
to
his
visitor
insular
education
and
then
again
began
to
twangle
his
viol
the
old
fool
said
arthur
his
daughter
is
dethroned
his
dominions
crumbling
to
pieces
his
family
on
the
eve
of
becoming
extinct
his
grandson
driven
from
one
to
another
and
expelled
from
his
mother
inheritance
and
he
can
find
amusement
in
these
fopperies
i
thought
him
with
his
long
white
beard
like
nicholas
bonstetten
but
the
old
swiss
is
a
solomon
compared
with
him
as
these
and
other
reflections
highly
disparaging
to
king
rené
passed
through
arthur
mind
he
reached
the
place
of
rendezvous
and
found
thiebault
beneath
the
steaming
fountain
forced
from
one
of
those
hot
springs
which
had
been
the
delight
of
the
romans
from
an
early
period
thiebault
having
assured
his
master
that
his
retinue
horse
and
man
were
so
disposed
as
to
be
ready
on
an
instant
call
readily
undertook
to
guide
him
to
king
rené
palace
which
from
its
singularity
and
indeed
its
beauty
of
architecture
deserved
the
eulogium
which
the
old
monarch
had
bestowed
upon
it
the
front
consisted
of
three
towers
of
roman
architecture
two
of
them
being
placed
on
the
angles
of
the
palace
and
the
third
which
served
the
purpose
of
a
mausoleum
forming
a
part
of
the
group
though
somewhat
detached
from
the
other
buildings
this
last
was
a
structure
of
beautiful
proportions
the
lower
part
of
the
edifice
was
square
serving
as
a
sort
of
pedestal
to
the
upper
part
which
was
circular
and
surrounded
by
columns
of
massive
granite
the
other
two
towers
at
the
angles
of
the
palace
were
round
and
also
ornamented
with
pillars
and
with
a
double
row
of
windows
in
front
of
and
connected
with
these
roman
remains
to
which
a
date
has
been
assigned
as
early
as
the
fifth
or
sixth
century
arose
the
ancient
palace
of
the
counts
of
provence
built
a
century
or
two
later
but
where
a
rich
gothic
or
moorish
front
contrasted
and
yet
harmonised
with
the
more
regular
and
massive
architecture
of
the
lords
of
the
world
it
is
not
more
than
thirty
or
forty
years
since
this
very
curious
remnant
of
antique
art
was
destroyed
to
make
room
for
new
public
buildings
which
have
never
yet
been
erected
arthur
really
experienced
some
sensation
of
the
kind
which
the
old
king
had
prophesied
and
stood
looking
with
wonder
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
into
which
men
of
all
kinds
seemed
to
enter
freely
after
looking
around
for
a
few
minutes
the
young
englishman
ascended
the
steps
of
a
noble
portico
and
asked
of
a
porter
as
old
and
as
lazy
as
a
great
man
domestic
ought
to
be
for
the
seneschal
named
to
him
by
the
king
the
corpulent
janitor
with
great
politeness
put
the
stranger
under
the
charge
of
a
page
who
ushered
him
to
a
chamber
in
which
he
found
another
aged
functionary
of
higher
rank
with
a
comely
face
a
clear
composed
eye
and
a
brow
which
having
never
been
knit
into
gravity
intimated
that
the
seneschal
of
aix
was
a
proficient
in
the
philosophy
of
his
royal
master
he
recognised
arthur
the
moment
he
addressed
him
you
speak
northern
french
fair
sir
you
have
lighter
hair
and
a
fairer
complexion
than
the
natives
of
this
country
you
ask
after
queen
margaret
by
all
these
marks
i
read
you
english
her
grace
of
england
is
at
this
moment
paying
a
vow
at
the
monastery
of
mont
victoire
and
if
your
name
be
arthur
philipson
i
have
commission
to
forward
you
to
her
presence
immediately
that
is
as
soon
as
you
have
tasted
of
the
royal
provision
the
young
man
would
have
remonstrated
but
the
seneschal
left
him
no
leisure
meat
and
mass
he
said
never
hindered
work
it
is
perilous
to
youth
to
journey
too
far
on
an
empty
stomach
he
himself
would
take
a
mouthful
with
the
queen
guest
and
pledge
him
to
boot
in
a
flask
of
old
hermitage
the
board
was
covered
with
an
alacrity
which
showed
that
hospitality
was
familiarly
exercised
in
king
rené
dominions
pasties
dishes
of
game
the
gallant
boar
head
and
other
delicacies
were
placed
on
the
table
and
the
seneschal
played
the
merry
host
frequently
apologising
unnecessarily
for
showing
an
indifferent
example
as
it
was
his
duty
to
carve
before
king
rené
and
the
good
king
was
never
pleased
unless
he
saw
him
feed
lustily
as
well
as
carve
featly
but
for
you
sir
guest
eat
freely
since
you
may
not
see
food
again
till
sunset
for
the
good
queen
takes
her
misfortunes
so
to
heart
that
sighs
are
her
food
and
her
tears
a
bottle
of
drink
as
the
psalmist
hath
it
but
i
bethink
me
you
will
need
steeds
for
yourself
and
your
equipage
to
reach
mont
victoire
which
is
seven
miles
from
aix
arthur
intimated
that
he
had
a
guide
and
horses
in
attendance
and
begged
permission
to
take
his
adieu
the
worthy
seneschal
his
fair
round
belly
graced
with
a
gold
chain
accompanied
him
to
the
gate
with
a
step
which
a
gentle
fit
of
the
gout
had
rendered
uncertain
but
which
he
assured
arthur
would
vanish
before
three
days
use
of
the
hot
springs
thiebault
appeared
before
the
gate
not
with
the
tired
steeds
from
which
they
had
dismounted
an
hour
since
but
with
fresh
palfreys
from
the
stable
of
the
king
they
are
yours
from
the
moment
you
have
put
foot
in
stirrup
said
the
seneschal
the
good
king
rené
never
received
back
as
his
property
a
horse
which
he
had
lent
to
a
guest
and
that
is
perhaps
one
reason
why
his
highness
and
we
of
his
household
must
walk
often
here
the
seneschal
exchanged
greetings
with
his
young
visitor
who
rode
forth
to
seek
queen
margaret
place
of
temporary
retirement
at
the
celebrated
monastery
of
victoire
he
demanded
of
his
guide
in
which
direction
it
lay
who
pointed
with
an
air
of
triumph
to
a
mountain
three
thousand
feet
and
upwards
in
height
which
arose
at
five
or
six
miles
distance
from
the
town
and
which
its
bold
and
rocky
summit
rendered
the
most
distinguished
object
of
the
landscape
thiebault
spoke
of
it
with
unusual
glee
and
energy
so
much
so
as
to
lead
arthur
to
conceive
that
his
trusty
squire
had
not
neglected
to
avail
himself
of
the
lavish
hospitality
of
bon
roy
thiebault
however
continued
to
expatiate
on
the
fame
of
the
mountain
and
monastery
they
derived
their
name
he
said
from
a
great
victory
which
was
gained
by
a
roman
general
named
caio
mario
against
two
large
armies
of
saracens
with
ultramontane
names
the
teutones
probably
and
cimbri
in
gratitude
to
heaven
for
which
victory
caio
mario
vowed
to
build
a
monastery
on
the
mountain
for
the
service
of
the
virgin
mary
in
honour
of
whom
he
had
been
baptised
with
all
the
importance
of
a
local
connoisseur
thiebault
proceeded
to
prove
his
general
assertion
by
specific
facts
yonder
he
said
was
the
camp
of
the
saracens
from
which
when
the
battle
was
apparently
decided
their
wives
and
women
rushed
with
horrible
screams
dishevelled
hair
and
the
gestures
of
furies
and
for
a
time
prevailed
in
stopping
the
flight
of
the
men
he
pointed
out
too
the
river
for
access
to
which
cut
off
by
the
superior
generalship
of
the
romans
the
barbarians
whom
he
called
saracens
hazarded
the
action
and
whose
streams
they
empurpled
with
their
blood
in
short
he
mentioned
many
circumstances
which
showed
how
accurately
tradition
will
preserve
the
particulars
of
ancient
events
even
whilst
forgetting
misstating
and
confounding
dates
and
persons
perceiving
that
arthur
lent
him
a
not
unwilling
ear
for
it
may
be
supposed
that
the
education
of
a
youth
bred
up
in
the
heat
of
civil
wars
was
not
well
qualified
to
criticise
his
account
of
the
wars
of
a
distant
period
the
provençal
when
he
had
exhausted
this
topic
drew
up
close
to
his
master
side
and
asked
in
a
suppressed
tone
whether
he
knew
or
was
desirous
of
being
made
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
margaret
having
left
aix
to
establish
herself
in
the
monastery
of
victoire
for
the
accomplishment
of
a
vow
answered
arthur
all
the
world
knows
it
all
aix
knows
the
contrary
said
thiebault
and
i
can
tell
you
the
truth
so
i
were
sure
it
would
not
offend
your
seignorie
the
truth
can
offend
no
reasonable
man
so
it
be
expressed
in
the
terms
of
which
queen
margaret
must
be
spoken
in
the
presence
of
an
englishman
thus
replied
arthur
willing
to
receive
what
information
he
could
gather
and
desirous
at
the
same
time
to
check
the
petulance
of
his
attendant
i
have
nothing
replied
his
follower
to
state
in
disparagement
of
the
gracious
queen
whose
only
misfortune
is
that
like
her
royal
father
she
has
more
titles
than
towns
besides
i
know
well
that
you
englishmen
though
you
speak
wildly
of
your
sovereigns
yourselves
will
not
permit
others
to
fail
in
respect
to
them
say
on
then
answered
arthur
your
seignorie
must
know
then
said
thiebault
that
the
good
king
rené
has
been
much
disturbed
by
the
deep
melancholy
which
afflicted
queen
margaret
and
has
bent
himself
with
all
his
power
to
change
it
into
a
gayer
humour
he
made
entertainments
in
public
and
in
private
he
assembled
minstrels
and
troubadours
whose
music
and
poetry
might
have
drawn
smiles
from
one
on
his
deathbed
the
whole
country
resounded
with
mirth
and
glee
and
the
gracious
queen
could
not
stir
abroad
in
the
most
private
manner
but
before
she
had
gone
a
hundred
paces
she
lighted
on
an
ambush
consisting
of
some
pretty
pageant
or
festivous
mummery
composed
often
by
the
good
king
himself
which
interrupted
her
solitude
in
purpose
of
relieving
her
heavy
thoughts
with
some
pleasant
pastime
but
the
queen
deep
melancholy
rejected
all
these
modes
of
dispelling
it
and
at
length
she
confined
herself
to
her
own
apartments
and
absolutely
refused
to
see
even
her
royal
father
because
he
generally
brought
into
her
presence
those
whose
productions
he
thought
likely
to
soothe
her
sorrow
indeed
she
seemed
to
hear
the
harpers
with
loathing
and
excepting
one
wandering
englishman
who
sung
a
rude
and
melancholy
ballad
which
threw
her
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
to
whom
she
gave
a
chain
of
price
she
never
seemed
to
look
at
or
be
conscious
of
the
presence
of
any
one
and
at
length
as
i
have
had
the
honour
to
tell
your
seignorie
she
refused
to
see
even
her
royal
father
unless
he
came
alone
and
that
he
found
no
heart
to
do
i
wonder
not
at
it
said
the
young
man
by
the
white
swan
i
am
rather
surprised
his
mummery
drove
her
not
to
frenzy
something
like
it
indeed
took
place
said
thiebault
and
i
will
tell
your
seignorie
how
it
chanced
you
must
know
that
good
king
rené
unwilling
to
abandon
his
daughter
to
the
foul
fiend
of
melancholy
bethought
him
of
making
a
grand
effort
you
must
know
further
that
the
king
powerful
in
all
the
craft
of
troubadours
and
jongleurs
is
held
in
peculiar
esteem
for
conducting
mysteries
and
other
of
those
gamesome
and
delightful
sports
and
processions
with
which
our
holy
church
permits
her
graver
ceremonies
to
be
relieved
and
diversified
to
the
cheering
of
the
hearts
of
all
true
children
of
religion
it
is
admitted
that
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
approach
his
excellence
in
the
arrangement
of
the
and
the
tune
to
which
the
devils
cudgel
king
herod
to
the
great
edification
of
all
christian
spectators
is
of
our
good
king
royal
composition
he
hath
danced
at
tarasconne
in
the
ballet
of
martha
and
the
dragon
and
was
accounted
in
his
own
person
the
only
actor
competent
to
present
the
tarrasque
his
highness
introduced
also
a
new
ritual
into
the
consecration
of
the
boy
bishop
and
composed
an
entire
set
of
grotesque
music
for
the
festival
of
asses
in
short
his
strength
lies
in
those
pleasing
and
becoming
festivities
which
strew
the
path
of
edification
with
flowers
and
send
men
dancing
and
singing
on
their
way
to
heaven
now
the
good
king
rené
feeling
his
own
genius
for
such
recreative
compositions
resolved
to
exert
it
to
the
utmost
in
the
hope
that
he
might
thereby
relieve
the
melancholy
in
which
his
daughter
was
plunged
and
which
infected
all
that
approached
her
it
chanced
some
short
time
since
that
the
queen
was
absent
for
certain
days
i
know
not
where
or
on
what
business
but
it
gave
the
good
king
time
to
make
his
preparations
so
when
his
daughter
returned
he
with
much
importunity
prevailed
on
her
to
make
part
of
a
religious
procession
to
sauveur
the
principal
church
in
aix
the
queen
innocent
of
what
was
intended
decked
herself
with
solemnity
to
witness
and
partake
of
what
she
expected
would
prove
a
work
of
grave
piety
but
no
sooner
had
she
appeared
on
the
esplanade
in
front
of
the
palace
than
more
than
a
hundred
masks
dressed
up
like
turks
jews
saracens
moors
and
i
know
not
whom
besides
crowded
around
to
offer
her
their
homage
in
the
character
of
the
queen
of
sheba
and
a
grotesque
piece
of
music
called
them
to
arrange
themselves
for
a
ludicrous
ballet
in
which
they
addressed
the
queen
in
the
most
entertaining
manner
and
with
the
most
extravagant
gestures
the
queen
stunned
with
the
noise
and
affronted
with
the
petulance
of
this
unexpected
onset
would
have
gone
back
into
the
palace
but
the
doors
had
been
shut
by
the
king
order
so
soon
as
she
set
forth
and
her
retreat
in
that
direction
was
cut
off
finding
herself
excluded
from
the
palace
the
queen
advanced
to
the
front
of
the
façade
and
endeavoured
by
signs
and
words
to
appease
the
hubbub
but
the
maskers
who
had
their
instructions
only
answered
with
songs
music
and
shouts
i
would
said
arthur
there
had
been
a
score
of
english
yeomen
in
presence
with
their
quarterstaves
to
teach
the
bawling
villains
respect
for
one
that
has
worn
the
crown
of
england
all
the
noise
that
was
made
before
was
silence
and
soft
music
continued
thiebault
till
that
when
the
good
king
himself
appeared
grotesquely
dressed
in
the
character
of
king
solomon
to
whom
of
all
princes
he
has
the
least
resemblance
said
arthur
with
such
capers
and
gesticulations
of
welcome
to
the
queen
of
sheba
as
i
am
assured
by
those
who
saw
it
would
have
brought
a
dead
man
alive
again
or
killed
a
living
man
with
laughing
among
other
properties
he
had
in
his
hand
a
truncheon
somewhat
formed
like
a
fool
bauble
a
most
fit
sceptre
for
such
a
sovereign
said
arthur
which
was
headed
continued
thiebault
by
a
model
of
the
jewish
temple
finely
gilded
and
curiously
cut
in
pasteboard
he
managed
this
with
the
utmost
grace
and
delighted
every
spectator
by
his
gaiety
and
activity
excepting
the
queen
who
the
more
he
skipped
and
capered
seemed
to
be
the
more
incensed
until
on
his
approaching
her
to
conduct
her
to
the
procession
she
seemed
roused
to
a
sort
of
frenzy
struck
the
truncheon
out
of
his
hand
and
breaking
through
the
crowd
who
felt
as
if
a
tigress
had
leapt
amongst
them
from
a
showman
cart
rushed
into
the
royal
courtyard
ere
the
order
of
the
scenic
representation
which
her
violence
had
interrupted
could
be
restored
the
queen
again
issued
forth
mounted
and
attended
by
two
or
three
english
cavaliers
of
her
majesty
suite
she
forced
her
way
through
the
crowd
without
regarding
either
their
safety
or
her
own
flew
like
a
along
the
streets
and
never
drew
bridle
till
she
was
as
far
up
this
same
mont
victoire
as
the
road
would
permit
she
was
then
received
into
the
convent
and
has
since
remained
there
and
a
vow
of
penance
is
the
pretext
to
cover
over
the
quarrel
betwixt
her
and
her
father
how
long
may
it
be
said
arthur
since
these
things
chanced
it
is
but
three
days
since
queen
margaret
left
aix
in
the
manner
i
have
told
but
we
are
come
as
far
up
the
mountain
as
men
usually
ride
see
yonder
is
the
monastery
rising
betwixt
two
huge
rocks
which
form
the
very
top
of
mont
victoire
there
is
no
more
open
ground
than
is
afforded
by
the
cleft
into
which
the
convent
of
mary
of
victory
is
as
it
were
niched
and
the
access
is
guarded
by
the
most
dangerous
precipices
to
ascend
the
mountain
you
must
keep
that
narrow
path
which
winding
and
turning
among
the
cliffs
leads
at
length
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
the
gate
of
the
monastery
and
what
becomes
of
you
and
the
horses
said
arthur
we
will
rest
said
thiebault
in
the
hospital
maintained
by
the
good
fathers
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
for
the
accommodation
of
those
who
attend
on
pilgrims
for
i
promise
you
the
shrine
is
visited
by
many
who
come
from
afar
and
are
attended
both
by
man
and
care
not
for
me
i
shall
be
first
under
cover
but
there
muster
yonder
in
the
west
some
threatening
clouds
from
which
your
seignorie
may
suffer
inconvenience
unless
you
reach
the
convent
in
time
i
will
give
you
an
hour
to
do
the
feat
and
will
say
you
are
as
active
as
a
if
you
reach
it
within
the
time
arthur
looked
around
him
and
did
indeed
remark
a
mustering
of
clouds
in
the
distant
west
which
threatened
soon
to
change
the
character
of
the
day
which
had
hitherto
been
brilliantly
clear
and
so
serene
that
the
falling
of
a
leaf
might
have
been
heard
he
therefore
turned
him
to
the
steep
and
rocky
path
which
ascended
the
mountain
sometimes
by
scaling
almost
precipitous
rocks
and
sometimes
by
reaching
their
tops
by
a
more
circuitous
process
it
winded
through
thickets
of
wild
boxwood
and
other
low
aromatic
shrubs
which
afforded
some
pasture
for
the
mountain
goats
but
were
a
bitter
annoyance
to
the
traveller
who
had
to
press
through
them
such
obstacles
were
so
frequent
that
the
full
hour
allowed
by
thiebault
had
elapsed
before
he
stood
on
the
summit
of
mont
victoire
and
in
front
of
the
singular
convent
of
the
same
name
we
have
already
said
that
the
crest
of
the
mountain
consisting
entirely
of
one
bare
and
solid
rock
was
divided
by
a
cleft
or
opening
into
two
heads
or
peaks
between
which
the
convent
was
built
occupying
all
the
space
between
them
the
front
of
the
building
was
of
the
most
ancient
and
sombre
cast
of
the
old
gothic
or
rather
as
it
has
been
termed
the
saxon
and
in
that
respect
corresponded
with
the
savage
exterior
of
the
naked
cliffs
of
which
the
structure
seemed
to
make
a
part
and
by
which
it
was
entirely
surrounded
excepting
a
small
open
space
of
more
level
ground
where
at
the
expense
of
much
toil
and
by
carrying
earth
up
the
hill
from
different
spots
where
they
could
collect
it
in
small
quantities
the
good
fathers
had
been
able
to
arrange
the
accommodations
of
a
garden
a
bell
summoned
a
lay
brother
the
porter
of
this
singularly
situated
monastery
to
whom
arthur
announced
himself
as
an
english
merchant
philipson
by
name
who
came
to
pay
his
duty
to
queen
margaret
the
porter
with
much
respect
showed
the
stranger
into
the
convent
and
ushered
him
into
a
parlour
which
looking
towards
aix
commanded
an
extensive
and
splendid
prospect
over
the
southern
and
western
parts
of
provence
this
was
the
direction
in
which
arthur
had
approached
the
mountain
from
aix
but
the
circuitous
path
by
which
he
had
ascended
had
completely
carried
him
round
the
hill
the
western
side
of
the
monastery
to
which
the
parlour
looked
commanded
the
noble
view
we
have
mentioned
and
a
species
of
balcony
which
connecting
the
two
twin
crags
at
this
place
not
above
four
or
five
yards
asunder
ran
along
the
front
of
the
building
and
appeared
to
be
constructed
for
the
purpose
of
enjoying
it
but
on
stepping
from
one
of
the
windows
of
the
parlour
upon
this
battlemented
bartizan
arthur
became
aware
that
the
wall
on
which
the
parapet
rested
stretched
along
the
edge
of
a
precipice
which
sank
sheer
down
five
hundred
feet
at
least
from
the
foundations
of
the
convent
surprised
and
startled
at
finding
himself
on
so
giddy
a
verge
arthur
turned
his
eyes
from
the
gulf
beneath
him
to
admire
the
distant
landscape
partly
illumined
with
ominous
lustre
by
the
now
westerly
sun
the
setting
beams
showed
in
dark
red
splendour
a
vast
variety
of
hill
and
dale
champaign
and
cultivated
ground
with
towns
churches
and
castles
some
of
which
rose
from
among
trees
while
others
seemed
founded
on
rocky
eminences
others
again
lurked
by
the
side
of
streams
or
lakes
to
which
the
heat
and
drought
of
the
climate
naturally
attracted
them
the
rest
of
the
landscape
presented
similar
objects
when
the
weather
was
serene
but
they
were
now
rendered
indistinct
or
altogether
obliterated
by
the
sullen
shade
of
the
approaching
clouds
which
gradually
spread
over
great
part
of
the
horizon
and
threatened
altogether
to
eclipse
the
sun
though
the
lord
of
the
horizon
still
struggled
to
maintain
his
influence
and
like
a
dying
hero
seemed
most
glorious
even
in
the
moment
of
defeat
wild
sounds
like
groans
and
howls
formed
by
the
wind
in
the
numerous
caverns
of
the
rocky
mountain
added
to
the
terrors
of
the
scene
and
seemed
to
foretell
the
fury
of
some
distant
storm
though
the
air
in
general
was
even
unnaturally
calm
and
breathless
in
gazing
on
this
extraordinary
scene
arthur
did
justice
to
the
monks
who
had
chosen
this
wild
and
grotesque
situation
from
which
they
could
witness
nature
in
her
wildest
and
grandest
demonstrations
and
compare
the
nothingness
of
humanity
with
her
awful
convulsions
so
much
was
arthur
awed
by
the
scene
before
him
that
he
had
almost
forgotten
while
gazing
from
the
bartizan
the
important
business
which
had
brought
him
to
this
place
when
it
was
suddenly
recalled
by
finding
himself
in
the
presence
of
margaret
of
anjou
who
not
seeing
him
in
the
parlour
of
reception
had
stept
upon
the
balcony
that
she
might
meet
with
him
the
sooner
the
queen
dress
was
black
without
any
ornament
except
a
gold
coronal
of
an
inch
in
breadth
restraining
her
long
black
tresses
of
which
advancing
years
and
misfortunes
had
partly
altered
the
hue
there
was
placed
within
the
circlet
a
black
plume
with
a
red
rose
the
last
of
the
season
which
the
good
father
who
kept
the
garden
had
presented
to
her
that
morning
as
the
badge
of
her
husband
house
care
fatigue
and
sorrow
seemed
to
dwell
on
her
brow
and
her
features
to
another
messenger
she
would
in
all
probability
have
administered
a
sharp
rebuke
for
not
being
alert
in
his
duty
to
receive
her
as
she
entered
but
arthur
age
and
appearance
corresponded
with
that
of
her
loved
and
lost
son
he
was
the
son
of
a
lady
whom
margaret
had
loved
with
almost
sisterly
affection
and
the
presence
of
arthur
continued
to
excite
in
the
dethroned
queen
the
same
feelings
of
maternal
tenderness
which
had
been
awakened
on
their
first
meeting
in
the
cathedral
of
strasburg
she
raised
him
as
he
kneeled
at
her
feet
spoke
to
him
with
much
kindness
and
encouraged
him
to
detail
at
full
length
his
father
message
and
such
other
news
as
his
brief
residence
at
dijon
had
made
him
acquainted
with
she
demanded
which
way
duke
charles
had
moved
with
his
army
as
i
was
given
to
understand
by
the
master
of
his
artillery
said
arthur
towards
the
lake
of
neufchatel
on
which
side
he
proposes
his
first
attack
on
the
swiss
the
headstrong
fool
said
queen
margaret
he
resembles
the
poor
lunatic
who
went
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
that
he
might
meet
the
rain
does
thy
father
then
continued
margaret
advise
me
to
give
up
the
last
remains
of
the
extensive
territories
once
the
dominions
of
our
royal
house
and
for
some
thousand
crowns
and
the
paltry
aid
of
a
few
hundred
lances
to
relinquish
what
is
left
of
our
patrimony
to
our
proud
and
selfish
kinsman
of
burgundy
who
extends
his
claim
to
our
all
and
affords
so
little
help
or
even
promise
of
help
in
return
i
should
have
ill
discharged
my
father
commission
said
arthur
if
i
had
left
your
highness
to
think
that
he
recommends
so
great
a
sacrifice
he
feels
most
deeply
the
duke
of
burgundy
grasping
desire
of
dominion
nevertheless
he
thinks
that
provence
must
on
king
rené
death
or
sooner
fall
either
to
the
share
of
duke
charles
or
to
louis
of
france
whatever
opposition
your
highness
may
make
to
such
a
destination
and
it
may
be
that
my
father
as
a
knight
and
a
soldier
hopes
much
from
obtaining
the
means
to
make
another
attempt
on
britain
but
the
decision
must
rest
with
your
highness
young
man
said
the
queen
the
contemplation
of
a
question
so
doubtful
almost
deprives
me
of
reason
as
she
spoke
she
sank
down
as
one
who
needs
rest
on
a
stone
seat
placed
on
the
very
verge
of
the
balcony
regardless
of
the
storm
which
now
began
to
rise
with
dreadful
gusts
of
wind
the
course
of
which
being
intermitted
and
altered
by
the
crags
round
which
they
howled
it
seemed
as
if
in
very
deed
boreas
and
eurus
and
caurus
unchaining
the
winds
from
every
quarter
of
heaven
were
contending
for
mastery
around
the
convent
of
our
lady
of
victory
amid
this
tumult
and
amid
billows
of
mist
which
concealed
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
and
masses
of
clouds
which
racked
fearfully
over
their
heads
the
roar
of
the
descending
waters
rather
resembled
the
fall
of
cataracts
than
the
rushing
of
torrents
of
rain
the
seat
on
which
margaret
had
placed
herself
was
in
a
considerable
degree
sheltered
from
the
storm
but
its
eddies
varying
in
every
direction
often
tossed
aloft
her
dishevelled
hair
and
we
can
not
describe
the
appearance
of
her
noble
and
beautiful
yet
ghastly
and
wasted
features
agitated
strongly
by
anxious
hesitation
and
conflicting
thoughts
unless
to
those
of
our
readers
who
have
had
the
advantage
of
having
seen
our
inimitable
siddons
in
such
a
character
as
this
arthur
confounded
by
anxiety
and
terror
could
only
beseech
her
majesty
to
retire
before
the
fury
of
the
approaching
storm
into
the
interior
of
the
convent
no
she
replied
with
firmness
roofs
and
walls
have
ears
and
monks
though
they
have
forsworn
the
world
are
not
the
less
curious
to
know
what
passes
beyond
their
cells
it
is
in
this
place
you
must
hear
what
i
have
to
say
as
a
soldier
you
should
scorn
a
blast
of
wind
or
a
shower
of
rain
and
to
me
who
have
often
held
counsel
amidst
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
clash
of
arms
prompt
for
instant
fight
the
war
of
elements
is
an
unnoticed
trifle
i
tell
thee
young
arthur
vere
as
i
would
to
your
father
as
i
would
to
my
son
if
indeed
heaven
had
left
such
a
blessing
to
a
wretch
forlorn
she
paused
and
then
proceeded
i
tell
thee
as
i
would
have
told
my
beloved
edward
that
margaret
whose
resolutions
were
once
firm
and
immovable
as
these
rocks
among
which
we
are
placed
is
now
doubtful
and
variable
as
the
clouds
which
are
drifting
around
us
i
told
your
father
in
the
joy
of
meeting
once
more
a
subject
of
such
inappreciable
loyalty
of
the
sacrifices
i
would
make
to
assure
the
assistance
of
charles
of
burgundy
to
so
gallant
an
undertaking
as
that
proposed
to
him
by
the
faithful
oxford
but
since
i
saw
him
i
have
had
cause
of
deep
reflection
i
met
my
aged
father
only
to
offend
and
i
say
it
with
shame
to
insult
the
old
man
in
presence
of
his
people
our
tempers
are
as
opposed
as
the
sunshine
which
a
short
space
since
gilded
a
serene
and
beautiful
landscape
differs
from
the
tempests
which
are
now
wasting
it
i
spurned
with
open
scorn
and
contempt
what
he
in
his
mistaken
affection
had
devised
for
means
of
consolation
and
disgusted
with
the
idle
follies
which
he
had
devised
for
curing
the
melancholy
of
a
dethroned
queen
a
widowed
spouse
and
alas
a
childless
mother
i
retired
hither
from
the
noisy
and
idle
mirth
which
was
the
bitterest
aggravation
of
my
sorrows
such
and
so
gentle
is
rené
temper
that
even
my
unfilial
conduct
will
not
diminish
my
influence
over
him
and
if
your
father
had
announced
that
the
duke
of
burgundy
like
a
knight
and
a
sovereign
had
cordially
and
nobly
entered
into
the
plan
of
the
faithful
oxford
i
could
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
obtain
the
cession
of
territory
his
cold
and
ambitious
policy
requires
in
order
to
insure
the
assistance
which
he
now
postpones
to
afford
till
he
has
gratified
his
own
haughty
humour
by
settling
needless
quarrels
with
his
unoffending
neighbours
since
i
have
been
here
and
calmness
and
solitude
have
given
me
time
to
reflect
i
have
thought
on
the
offences
i
have
given
the
old
man
and
on
the
wrongs
i
was
about
to
do
him
my
father
let
me
do
him
justice
is
also
the
father
of
his
people
they
have
dwelt
under
their
vines
and
in
ignoble
ease
perhaps
but
free
from
oppression
and
exaction
and
their
happiness
has
been
that
of
their
good
king
must
i
change
all
this
must
i
aid
in
turning
over
these
contented
people
to
a
fierce
headlong
arbitrary
prince
may
i
not
break
even
the
easy
and
thoughtless
heart
of
my
poor
old
father
should
i
succeed
in
urging
him
to
do
so
these
are
questions
which
i
shudder
even
to
ask
myself
on
the
other
hand
to
disappoint
the
toils
the
venturous
hopes
of
your
father
to
forego
the
only
opportunity
which
may
ever
again
offer
itself
of
revenge
on
the
bloody
traitors
of
york
and
restoration
of
the
house
of
lancaster
arthur
the
scene
around
us
is
not
so
convulsed
by
the
fearful
tempest
and
the
driving
clouds
as
my
mind
is
by
doubt
and
uncertainty
alas
replied
arthur
i
am
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
be
your
majesty
adviser
in
a
case
so
arduous
i
would
my
father
had
been
in
presence
himself
i
know
what
he
would
have
said
replied
the
queen
but
knowing
all
i
despair
of
aid
from
human
counsellors
i
have
sought
others
but
they
also
are
deaf
to
my
entreaties
yes
arthur
misfortunes
have
rendered
her
superstitious
know
that
beneath
these
rocks
and
under
the
foundation
of
this
convent
there
runs
a
cavern
entering
by
a
secret
and
defended
passage
a
little
to
the
westward
of
the
summit
and
running
through
the
mountain
having
an
opening
to
the
south
from
which
as
from
this
bartizan
you
can
view
the
landscape
so
lately
seen
from
this
balcony
or
the
strife
of
winds
and
confusion
of
clouds
which
we
now
behold
in
the
middle
of
this
cavernous
thoroughfare
is
a
natural
pit
or
perforation
of
great
but
unknown
depth
a
stone
dropped
into
it
is
heard
to
dash
from
side
to
side
until
the
noise
of
its
descent
thundering
from
cliff
to
cliff
dies
away
in
distant
and
faint
tinkling
less
loud
than
that
of
a
bell
at
a
mile
distance
the
common
people
in
their
jargon
call
this
fearful
gulf
lou
garagoule
and
the
traditions
of
the
monastery
annex
wild
and
fearful
recollections
to
a
place
in
itself
sufficiently
terrible
oracles
it
is
said
spoke
from
thence
in
pagan
days
by
subterranean
voices
arising
from
the
abyss
and
from
these
the
roman
general
is
said
to
have
heard
in
strange
and
uncouth
rhymes
promises
of
the
victory
which
gives
name
to
this
mountain
these
oracles
it
is
averred
may
be
yet
consulted
after
performance
of
strange
rites
in
which
heathen
ceremonies
are
mixed
with
christian
acts
of
devotion
the
abbots
of
mont
victoire
have
denounced
the
consultation
of
lou
garagoule
and
the
spirits
who
reside
there
to
be
criminal
but
as
the
sin
may
be
expiated
by
presents
to
the
church
by
masses
and
penances
the
door
is
sometimes
opened
by
the
complaisant
fathers
to
those
whose
daring
curiosity
leads
them
at
all
risks
and
by
whatever
means
to
search
into
futurity
arthur
i
have
made
the
experiment
and
am
even
now
returned
from
the
gloomy
cavern
in
which
according
to
the
traditional
ritual
i
have
spent
six
hours
by
the
margin
of
the
gulf
a
place
so
dismal
that
after
its
horrors
even
this
tempestuous
scene
is
refreshing
the
queen
stopped
and
arthur
the
more
struck
with
the
wild
tale
that
it
reminded
him
of
his
place
of
imprisonment
at
la
ferette
asked
anxiously
if
her
inquiries
had
obtained
any
answer
none
whatever
replied
the
unhappy
princess
the
demons
of
garagoule
if
there
be
such
are
deaf
to
the
suit
of
an
unfortunate
wretch
like
me
to
whom
neither
friends
nor
fiends
will
afford
counsel
or
assistance
it
is
my
father
circumstances
which
prevent
my
instant
and
strong
resolution
were
my
own
claims
on
this
piping
and
paltry
nation
of
troubadours
alone
interested
i
could
for
the
chance
of
once
more
setting
my
foot
in
merry
england
as
easily
and
willingly
resign
them
and
their
paltry
coronet
as
i
commit
to
the
storm
this
idle
emblem
of
the
royal
rank
which
i
have
lost
as
margaret
spoke
she
tore
from
her
hair
the
sable
feather
and
rose
which
the
tempest
had
detached
from
the
circlet
in
which
they
were
placed
and
tossed
them
from
the
battlement
with
a
gesture
of
wild
energy
they
were
instantly
whirled
off
in
a
bickering
eddy
of
the
agitated
clouds
which
swept
the
feather
far
distant
into
empty
space
through
which
the
eye
could
not
pursue
it
but
while
that
of
arthur
involuntarily
strove
to
follow
its
course
a
contrary
gust
of
wind
caught
the
red
rose
and
drove
it
back
against
his
breast
so
that
it
was
easy
for
him
to
catch
hold
of
and
retain
it
joy
joy
and
good
fortune
royal
mistress
he
said
returning
to
her
the
emblematic
flower
the
tempest
brings
back
the
badge
of
lancaster
to
its
proper
owner
i
accept
the
omen
said
margaret
but
it
concerns
yourself
noble
youth
and
not
me
the
feather
which
is
borne
away
to
waste
and
desolation
is
margaret
emblem
my
eyes
will
never
see
the
restoration
of
the
line
of
lancaster
but
you
will
live
to
behold
it
and
to
aid
to
achieve
it
and
to
dye
our
red
rose
deeper
yet
in
the
blood
of
tyrants
and
traitors
my
thoughts
are
so
strangely
poised
that
a
feather
or
a
flower
may
turn
the
scale
but
my
head
is
still
giddy
and
my
heart
you
shall
see
another
margaret
and
till
then
adieu
it
was
time
to
retire
for
the
tempest
began
to
be
mingled
with
fiercer
showers
of
rain
when
they
the
parlour
the
queen
clapped
her
hands
and
two
female
attendants
entered
let
the
father
abbot
know
she
said
that
it
is
our
desire
that
this
young
gentleman
receive
for
this
night
such
hospitality
as
befits
an
esteemed
friend
of

young
sir
farewell
with
a
countenance
which
betrayed
not
the
late
emotion
of
her
mind
and
with
a
stately
courtesy
that
would
have
become
her
when
she
graced
the
halls
of
windsor
she
extended
her
hand
which
the
youth
saluted
respectfully
after
her
leaving
the
parlour
the
abbot
entered
and
in
his
attention
to

and

for

evening
showed

anxiety

chapter
xiii
want
you
a
man
experienced
in
the
world
and
its
affairs
here
he
is
for
your
he
a
monk
he
hath
forsworn
the
world
and
all
its
work
the
rather
that
he
knows
it
passing
well
special
the
worst
of
it
for
he
a
monk
while
the
dawn
of
the
morning
was
yet
grey
arthur
was
awakened
by
a
loud
ringing
at
the
gate
of
the
monastery
and
presently
afterwards
the
porter
entered
the
cell
which
had
been
allotted
to
him
for
his
lodgings
to
tell
him
that
if
his
name
was
arthur
philipson
a
brother
of
their
order
had
brought
him
despatches
from
his
father
the
youth
started
up
hastily
attired
himself
and
was
introduced
in
the
parlour
to
a
carmelite
monk
being
of
the
same
order
with
the
community
of
victoire
i
have
ridden
many
a
mile
young
man
to
present
you
with
this
letter
said
the
monk
having
undertaken
to
your
father
that
it
should
be
delivered
without
delay
i
came
to
aix
last
night
during
the
storm
and
learning
at
the
palace
that
you
had
ridden
hither
i
mounted
as
soon
as
the
tempest
abated
and
here
i
am
i
am
beholden
to
you
father
said
the
youth
and
if
i
could
repay
your
pains
with
a
small
donative
to
your
convent
by
no
means
answered
the
good
father
i
took
my
personal
trouble
out
of
friendship
to
your
father
and
mine
own
errand
led
me
this
way
the
expenses
of
my
long
journey
have
been
amply
provided
for
but
open
your
packet
i
can
answer
your
questions
at
leisure
the
young
man
accordingly
stepped
into
an
embrasure
of
the
window
and
read
as
follows
son
arthur
touching
the
state
of
the
country
in
so
far
as
concerns
the
safety
of
travelling
know
that
the
same
is
precarious
the
duke
hath
taken
the
towns
of
brie
and
granson
and
put
to
death
five
hundred
men
whom
he
made
prisoners
in
garrison
there
but
the
confederates
are
approaching
with
a
large
force
and
god
will
judge
for
the
right
howsoever
the
game
may
go
these
are
sharp
wars
in
which
little
quarter
is
spoken
of
on
either
side
and
therefore
there
is
no
safety
for
men
of
our
profession
till
something
decisive
shall
happen
in
the
meantime
you
may
assure
the
widowed
lady
that
our
correspondent
continues
well
disposed
to
purchase
the
property
which
she
has
in
hand
but
will
scarce
be
able
to
pay
the
price
till
his
present
pressing
affairs
shall
be
settled
which
i
hope
will
be
in
time
to
permit
us
to
embark
the
funds
in
the
profitable
adventure
i
told
our
friend
of
i
have
employed
a
friar
travelling
to
provence
to
carry
this
letter
which
i
trust
will
come
safe
the
bearer
may
be
trusted
your
affectionate
father
john
philipson
arthur
easily
comprehended
the
latter
part
of
the
epistle
and
rejoiced
he
had
received
it
at
so
critical
a
moment
he
questioned
the
carmelite
on
the
amount
of
the
duke
army
which
the
monk
stated
to
amount
to
sixty
thousand
men
while
he
said
the
confederates
though
making
every
exertion
had
not
yet
been
able
to
assemble
the
third
part
of
that
number
the
young
ferrand
de
vaudemont
was
with
their
army
and
had
received
it
was
thought
some
secret
assistance
from
france
but
as
he
was
little
known
in
arms
and
had
few
followers
the
empty
title
of
general
which
he
bore
added
little
to
the
strength
of
the
confederates
upon
the
whole
he
reported
that
every
chance
appeared
to
be
in
favour
of
charles
and
arthur
who
looked
upon
his
success
as
presenting
the
only
chance
in
favour
of
his
enterprise
was
not
a
little
pleased
to
find
it
insured
as
far
as
depended
on
a
great
superiority
of
force
he
had
no
leisure
to
make
further
inquiries
for
the
queen
at
that
moment
entered
the
apartment
and
the
carmelite
learning
her
quality
withdrew
from
her
presence
in
deep
reverence
the
paleness
of
her
complexion
still
bespoke
the
fatigues
of
the
day
preceding
but
as
she
graciously
bestowed
on
arthur
the
greetings
of
the
morning
her
voice
was
firm
her
eye
clear
and
her
countenance
steady
i
meet
you
she
said
not
as
i
left
you
but
determined
in
my
purpose
i
am
satisfied
that
if
rené
does
not
voluntarily
yield
up
his
throne
of
provence
by
some
step
like
that
which
we
propose
he
will
be
hurled
from
it
by
violence
in
which
it
may
be
his
life
will
not
be
spared
we
will
therefore
to
work
with
all
speed
the
worst
is
that
i
can
not
leave
this
convent
till
i
have
made
the
necessary
penances
for
having
visited
the
garagoule
without
performing
which
i
were
no
christian
woman
when
you
return
to
aix
inquire
at
the
palace
for
my
secretary
with
whom
this
line
will
give
you
credence
i
have
even
before
this
door
of
hope
opened
to
me
endeavoured
to
form
an
estimate
of
king
rené
situation
and
collected
the
documents
for
that
purpose
tell
him
to
send
me
duly
sealed
and
under
fitting
charge
the
small
cabinet
hooped
with
silver
hours
of
penance
for
past
errors
may
be
employed
to
prevent
others
and
from
the
contents
of
that
cabinet
i
shall
learn
whether
i
am
in
this
weighty
matter
sacrificing
my
father
interests
to
my
own
hopes
but
of
this
i
have
little
or
no
doubt
i
can
cause
the
deeds
of
resignation
and
transference
to
be
drawn
up
here
under
my
own
direction
and
arrange
the
execution
of
them
when
i
return
to
aix
which
shall
be
the
first
moment
after
my
penance
is
concluded
and
this
letter
gracious
madam
said
arthur
will
inform
you
what
events
are
approaching
and
of
what
importance
it
may
be
to
take
time
by
the
forelock
place
me
but
in
possession
of
these
momentous
deeds
and
i
will
travel
night
and
day
till
i
reach
the
duke
camp
i
shall
find
him
most
likely
in
the
moment
of
victory
and
with
his
heart
too
much
open
to
refuse
a
boon
to
the
royal
kinswoman
who
is
surrendering
to
him
all
we
will
we
must
in
such
an
hour
obtain
princely
succours
and
we
shall
soon
see
if
the
licentious
edward
of
york
the
savage
richard
the
treacherous
and
perjured
clarence
are
hereafter
to
be
lords
of
merry
england
or
whether
they
must
give
place
to
a
more
rightful
sovereign
and
better
man
but
oh
royal
madam
all
depends
on
haste
true
yet
a
few
days
may
nay
must
cast
the
die
between
charles
and
his
opponents
and
ere
making
so
great
a
surrender
it
were
as
well
to
be
assured
that
he
whom
we
would
propitiate
is
in
capacity
to
assist
us
all
the
events
of
a
tragic
and
varied
life
have
led
me
to
see
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
inconsiderable
enemy
i
will
make
haste
however
trusting
in
the
interim
we
may
have
good
news
from
the
banks
of
the
lake
at
neufchatel
but
who
shall
be
employed
to
draw
these
most
important
deeds
said
the
young
man
margaret
mused
ere
she
replied
the
father
guardian
is
complaisant
and
i
think
faithful
but
i
would
not
willingly
repose
confidence
in
one
of
the
provençal
monks
stay
let
me
think
your
father
says
the
carmelite
who
brought
the
letter
may
be
trusted
he
shall
do
the
turn
he
is
a
stranger
and
will
be
silent
for
a
piece
of
money
farewell
arthur
de
you
will
be
treated
with
all
hospitality
by
my
father
if
thou
dost
receive
further
tidings
thou
wilt
let
me
know
them
or
should
i
have
instructions
to
send
thou
wilt
hear
from
so
benedicite
arthur
proceeded
to
wind
down
the
mountain
at
a
much
quicker
pace
than
he
had
ascended
on
the
day
before
the
weather
was
now
gloriously
serene
and
the
beauties
of
vegetation
in
a
country
where
it
never
totally
slumbers
were
at
once
delicious
and
refreshing
his
thoughts
wandered
from
the
crags
of
mont
victoire
to
the
cliff
of
the
canton
of
unterwalden
and
fancy
recalled
the
moments
when
his
walks
through
such
scenery
were
not
solitary
but
when
there
was
a
form
by
his
side
whose
simple
beauty
was
engraved
on
his
memory
such
thoughts
were
of
a
preoccupying
nature
and
i
grieve
to
say
that
they
entirely
drowned
the
recollection
of
the
mysterious
caution
given
him
by
his
father
intimating
that
arthur
might
not
be
able
to
comprehend
such
letters
as
he
should
receive
from
him
till
they
were
warmed
before
a
fire
the
first
thing
which
reminded
him
of
this
singular
caution
was
the
seeing
a
of
charcoal
in
the
kitchen
of
the
hostelry
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
where
he
found
thiebault
and
his
horses
this
was
the
first
fire
which
he
had
seen
since
receiving
his
letter
and
it
reminded
him
not
unnaturally
of
what
the
earl
had
recommended
great
was
his
surprise
to
see
that
after
exposing
the
paper
to
the
fire
as
if
to
dry
it
a
word
emerged
in
an
important
passage
of
the
letter
and
the
concluding
words
now
read
the
bearer
may
be
trusted
choked
with
shame
and
vexation
arthur
could
think
of
no
other
remedy
than
instantly
to
return
to
the
convent
and
acquaint
the
queen
with
this
discovery
which
he
hoped
still
to
convey
to
her
in
time
to
prevent
any
risk
being
incurred
by
the
carmelite
treachery
incensed
at
himself
and
eager
to
redeem
his
fault
he
bent
his
manly
breast
against
the
steep
hill
which
was
probably
never
scaled
in
so
short
time
as
by
the
young
heir
of
de
vere
for
within
forty
minutes
from
his
commencing
the
ascent
he
stood
breathless
and
panting
in
the
presence
of
queen
margaret
who
was
alike
surprised
at
his
appearance
and
his
exhausted
condition
trust
not
the
carmelite
he
exclaimed
you
are
betrayed
noble
queen
and
it
is
by
my
negligence
here
is
my
dagger
bid
me
strike
it
into
my
heart
margaret
demanded
and
obtained
a
more
special
explanation
and
when
it
was
given
she
said
it
is
an
unhappy
chance
but
your
instructions
ought
to
have
been
more
distinct
i
have
told
yonder
carmelite
the
purpose
of
the
contracts
and
engaged
with
him
to
draw
them
he
has
but
now
left
me
to
serve
at
the
choir
there
is
no
withdrawing
the
confidence
i
have
unhappily
placed
but
i
can
easily
prevail
with
the
father
guardian
to
prevent
the
monk
from
leaving
the
convent
till
we
are
indifferent
to
his
secrecy
it
is
our
best
chance
to
secure
it
and
we
will
take
care
that
what
inconvenience
he
sustains
by
his
detention
shall
be
well
recompensed
meanwhile
rest
thou
good
arthur
and
undo
the
throat
of
thy
mantle
poor
youth
thou
art
exhausted
with
thy
haste
arthur
obeyed
and
sat
down
on
a
seat
in
the
parlour
for
the
speed
which
he
had
exerted
rendered
him
almost
incapable
of
standing
if
i
could
but
see
he
said
the
false
monk
i
would
find
a
way
to
charm
him
to
secrecy
better
leave
him
to
me
said
the
queen
and
in
a
word
i
forbid
you
to
meddle
with
him
the
coif
can
treat
better
with
the
cowl
than
the
casque
can
do
say
no
more
of
him
i
joy
to
see
you
wear
around
your
neck
the
holy
relic
i
bestowed
on
you
but
what
moorish
charmlet
is
that
you
wear
beside
it
alas
i
need
not
ask
your
heightened
colour
almost
as
deep
as
when
you
entered
a
quarter
of
an
hour
hence
confesses
a
token
alas
poor
boy
hast
thou
not
only
such
a
share
of
thy
country
woes
to
bear
but
also
thine
own
load
of
affliction
not
the
less
poignant
now
that
future
time
will
show
thee
how
fantastic
it
is
margaret
of
anjou
could
once
have
aided
wherever
thy
affections
were
placed
but
now
she
can
only
contribute
to
the
misery
of
her
friends
not
to
their
happiness
but
this
lady
of
the
charm
arthur
is
she
fair
is
she
wise
and
virtuous
is
she
of
noble
birth
and
does
she
love
she
perused
his
countenance
with
the
glance
of
an
eagle
and
continued
to
all
thou
wouldst
answer
yes
if
shamefacedness
permitted
thee
love
her
then
in
turn
my
gallant
boy
for
love
is
the
parent
of
brave
actions
go
my
noble
youth
and
loyal
valorous
and
virtuous
enamoured
and
youthful
to
what
mayst
thou
not
rise
the
chivalry
of
ancient
europe
only
lives
in
a
bosom
like
thine
go
and
let
the
praises
of
a
queen
fire
thy
bosom
with
the
love
of
honour
and
achievement
in
three
days
we
meet
at
aix
arthur
highly
gratified
with
the
queen
condescension
once
more
left
her
presence
returning
down
the
mountain
with
a
speed
very
different
from
that
which
he
had
used
in
the
ascent
he
again
found
his
provençal
squire
who
had
remained
in
much
surprise
at
witnessing
the
confusion
in
which
his
master
had
left
the
inn
almost
immediately
after
he
had
entered
it
without
any
apparent
haste
or
agitation
arthur
explained
his
hasty
return
by
alleging
he
had
forgot
his
purse
at
the
convent
nay
in
that
case
said
thiebault
considering
what
you
left
and
where
you
left
it
i
do
not
wonder
at
your
speed
though
our
lady
save
me
as
i
never
saw
living
creature
save
a
goat
with
a
wolf
at
his
heels
make
his
way
over
crag
and
briers
with
half
such
rapidity
as
you
did
they
reached
aix
after
about
an
hour
riding
and
arthur
lost
no
time
in
waiting
upon
the
good
king
rené
who
gave
him
a
kind
reception
both
in
respect
of
the
letter
from
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
in
consideration
of
his
being
an
englishman
the
avowed
subject
of
the
unfortunate
margaret
the
placable
monarch
soon
forgave
his
young
guest
the
want
of
complaisance
with
which
he
had
eschewed
to
listen
to
his
compositions
and
arthur
speedily
found
that
to
apologise
for
his
want
of
breeding
in
that
particular
was
likely
to
lead
to
a
great
deal
more
rehearsing
than
he
could
find
patience
to
tolerate
he
could
only
avoid
the
old
king
extreme
desire
to
recite
his
own
poems
and
perform
his
own
music
by
engaging
him
in
speaking
of
his
daughter
margaret
arthur
had
been
sometimes
induced
to
doubt
the
influence
which
the
queen
boasted
herself
to
possess
over
her
aged
father
but
on
being
acquainted
with
him
personally
he
became
convinced
that
her
powerful
understanding
and
violent
passions
inspired
the
and
passive
king
with
a
mixture
of
pride
affection
and
fear
which
united
to
give
her
the
most
ample
authority
over
him
although
she
had
parted
with
him
but
a
day
or
two
since
and
in
a
manner
so
ungracious
on
her
side
rené
was
as
much
overjoyed
at
hearing
of
the
probability
of
her
speedy
return
as
the
fondest
father
could
have
been
at
the
prospect
of
being
reunited
to
the
most
dutiful
child
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
years
the
old
king
was
impatient
as
a
boy
for
the
day
of
her
arrival
and
still
strangely
unenlightened
on
the
difference
of
her
taste
from
his
own
he
was
with
difficulty
induced
to
lay
aside
a
project
of
meeting
her
in
the
character
of
old
palemon
the
prince
of
shepherds
and
their
pride
at
the
head
of
an
arcadian
procession
of
nymphs
and
swains
to
inspire
whose
choral
dances
and
songs
every
pipe
and
tambourine
in
the
country
was
to
be
placed
in
requisition
even
the
old
seneschal
however
intimated
his
disapprobation
of
this
species
of
so
that
rené
suffered
himself
at
length
to
be
persuaded
that
the
queen
was
too
much
occupied
by
the
religious
impressions
to
which
she
had
been
of
late
exposed
to
receive
any
agreeable
sensation
from
sights
or
sounds
of
levity
the
king
gave
way
to
reasons
which
he
could
not
sympathise
with
and
thus
margaret
escaped
the
shock
of
welcome
which
would
perhaps
have
driven
her
in
her
impatience
back
to
the
mountain
of
victoire
and
the
sable
cavern
of
lou
garagoule
during
the
time
of
her
absence
the
days
of
the
court
of
provence
were
employed
in
sports
and
rejoicings
of
every
description
tilting
at
the
barrier
with
blunted
spears
riding
at
the
ring
parties
for
and
falconry
frequented
by
the
youth
of
both
sexes
in
the
company
of
whom
the
king
delighted
while
the
evenings
were
consumed
in
dancing
and
music
arthur
could
not
but
be
sensible
that
not
long
since
all
this
would
have
made
him
perfectly
happy
but
the
last
months
of
his
existence
had
developed
his
understanding
and
passions
he
was
now
initiated
in
the
actual
business
of
human
life
and
looked
on
its
amusements
with
an
air
of
something
like
contempt
so
that
among
the
young
and
gay
noblesse
who
composed
this
merry
court
he
acquired
the
title
of
the
youthful
philosopher
which
was
not
bestowed
upon
him
it
may
be
supposed
as
inferring
anything
of
peculiar
compliment
on
the
fourth
day
news
was
received
by
an
express
messenger
that
queen
margaret
would
enter
aix
before
the
hour
of
noon
to
resume
her
residence
in
her
father
palace
the
good
king
rené
seemed
as
it
drew
nigh
to
fear
the
interview
with
his
daughter
as
much
as
he
had
previously
desired
it
and
contrived
to
make
all
around
him
partake
of
his
fidgety
anxiety
he
tormented
his
steward
and
cooks
to
recollect
what
dishes
they
had
ever
observed
her
to
taste
of
with
approbation
he
pressed
the
musicians
to
remember
the
tunes
which
she
approved
and
when
one
of
them
boldly
replied
he
had
never
known
her
majesty
endure
any
strain
with
patience
the
old
monarch
threatened
to
turn
him
out
of
his
service
for
slandering
the
taste
of
his
daughter
the
banquet
was
ordered
to
be
served
at
half
past
eleven
as
if
accelerating
it
would
have
had
the
least
effect
upon
hurrying
the
arrival
of
the
expected
guests
and
the
old
king
with
his
napkin
over
his
arm
traversed
the
hall
from
window
to
window
wearying
every
one
with
questions
whether
they
saw
anything
of
the
queen
of
england
exactly
as
the
bells
tolled
noon
the
queen
with
a
very
small
retinue
chiefly
english
and
in
mourning
habits
like
herself
rode
into
the
town
of
aix
king
rené
at
the
head
of
his
court
failed
not
to
descend
from
the
front
of
his
stately
palace
and
move
along
the
street
to
meet
his
daughter
lofty
proud
and
jealous
of
incurring
ridicule
margaret
was
not
pleased
with
this
public
greeting
in
the
but
she
was
desirous
at
present
to
make
amends
for
her
late
petulance
and
therefore
she
descended
from
her
palfrey
and
although
something
shocked
at
seeing
rené
equipped
with
a
napkin
she
humbled
herself
to
bend
the
knee
to
him
asking
at
once
his
blessing
and
forgiveness
thou
hast
thou
hast
my
blessing
my
suffering
dove
said
the
simple
king
to
the
proudest
and
most
impatient
princess
that
ever
wept
for
a
lost
and
for
thy
pardon
how
canst
thou
ask
it
who
never
didst
me
an
offence
since
god
made
me
father
to
so
gracious
a
child
rise
i
say
rise
nay
it
is
for
me
to
ask
thy
pardon
true
i
said
in
my
ignorance
and
thought
within
myself
that
my
heart
had
indited
a
goodly
thing
but
it
vexed
thee
it
is
therefore
for
me
to
crave
pardon
and
down
sank
good
king
rené
upon
both
knees
and
the
people
who
are
usually
captivated
with
anything
resembling
the
trick
of
the
scene
applauded
with
much
noise
and
some
smothered
laughter
a
situation
in
which
the
royal
daughter
and
her
parent
seemed
about
to
rehearse
the
scene
of
the
roman
charity
margaret
sensitively
alive
to
shame
and
fully
aware
that
her
present
position
was
sufficiently
ludicrous
in
its
publicity
at
least
signed
sharply
to
arthur
whom
she
saw
in
the
king
suite
to
come
to
her
and
using
his
arm
to
rise
she
muttered
to
him
aside
and
in
english
to
what
saint
shall
i
vow
myself
that
i
may
preserve
patience
when
i
so
much
need
it
for
pity
sake
royal
madam
recall
your
firmness
of
mind
and
composure
whispered
her
esquire
who
felt
at
the
moment
more
embarrassed
than
honoured
by
his
distinguished
office
for
he
could
feel
that
the
queen
actually
trembled
with
vexation
and
impatience
they
at
length
resumed
their
route
to
the
palace
the
father
and
daughter
arm
in
arm
a
posture
most
agreeable
to
margaret
who
could
bring
herself
to
endure
her
father
effusions
of
tenderness
and
the
general
tone
of
his
conversation
so
that
he
was
not
overheard
by
others
in
the
same
manner
she
bore
with
laudable
patience
the
teasing
attentions
which
he
addressed
to
her
at
table
noticed
some
of
his
particular
courtiers
inquired
after
others
led
the
way
to
his
favourite
subjects
of
conversation
on
poetry
painting
and
music
till
the
good
king
was
as
much
delighted
with
the
unwonted
civilities
of
his
daughter
as
ever
was
lover
with
the
favourable
confessions
of
his
mistress
when
after
years
of
warm
courtship
the
ice
of
her
bosom
is
at
length
thawed
it
cost
the
haughty
margaret
an
effort
to
bend
herself
to
play
this
part
her
pride
rebuked
her
for
stooping
to
flatter
her
father
foibles
in
order
to
bring
him
over
to
the
resignation
of
his
dominions
yet
having
undertaken
to
do
so
and
so
much
having
been
already
hazarded
upon
this
sole
remaining
chance
of
success
in
an
attack
upon
england
she
saw
or
was
willing
to
see
no
alternative
betwixt
the
banquet
and
the
ball
by
which
it
was
to
be
followed
the
queen
sought
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
arthur
bad
news
my
sage
counsellor
she
said
the
carmelite
never
returned
to
the
convent
after
the
service
was
over
having
learned
that
you
had
come
back
in
great
haste
he
had
i
suppose
concluded
he
might
stand
in
suspicion
so
he
left
the
convent
of
mont
st
victoire
we
must
hasten
the
measures
which
your
majesty
has
resolved
to
adopt
answered
arthur
i
will
speak
with
my
father
meanwhile
you
must
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
evening
for
to
you
they
may
be

i
give
you
this
cavalier
to
be
your
partner
for
the
evening
the
and
pretty
provençale
curtseyed
with
due
decorum
and
glanced
at
the
handsome
young
englishman
with
an
eye
of
approbation
but
whether
afraid
of
his
character
as
a
philosopher
or
his
doubtful
rank
added
the
saving
clause
if
my
mother
approves
your
mother
damsel
will
scarce
i
think
disapprove
of
any
partner
whom
you
receive
from
the
hands
of
margaret
of
anjou
happy
privilege
of
youth
she
added
with
a
sigh
as
the
youthful
couple
went
off
to
take
their
place
in
the
which
can
snatch
a
flower
even
on
the
roughest
road
arthur
acquitted
himself
so
well
during
the
evening
that
perhaps
the
young
countess
was
only
sorry
that
so
gay
and
handsome
a
gallant
limited
his
compliments
and
attentions
within
the
cold
bounds
of
that
courtesy
enjoined
by
the
rules
of
ceremony

the
next
day
opened
a
grave
scene
king
rené
had
not
forgotten
to
arrange
the
pleasures
of
the
day
when
to
his
horror
and
discomfiture
margaret
demanded
an
interview
upon
serious
business
if
there
was
a
proposition
in
the
world
which
rené
from
his
soul
detested
it
was
any
that
related
to
the
very
name
of
business
what
was
it
that
his
child
wanted
he
said
was
it
money
he
would
give
her
whatever
ready
sums
he
had
though
he
owned
his
exchequer
was
somewhat
bare
yet
he
had
received
his
income
for
the
season
it
was
ten
thousand
crowns
how
much
should
he
desire
to
be
paid
to
her
the
half
three
parts
or
the
whole
all
was
at
her
command
alas
my
dear
father
said
margaret
it
is
not
my
affairs
but
your
own
on
which
i
desire
to
speak
with
you
if
the
affairs
are
mine
said
rené
i
am
surely
master
to
put
them
off
to
another
day
to
some
rainy
dull
day
fit
for
no
better
purpose
see
my
love
the
are
all
on
their
steeds
and
ready
the
horses
are
neighing
and
pawing
the
gallants
and
maidens
mounted
and
ready
with
hawk
on
fist
the
spaniels
struggling
in
the
leash
it
were
a
sin
with
wind
and
weather
to
friend
to
lose
so
lovely
a
morning
let
them
ride
their
way
said
queen
margaret
and
find
their
sport
for
the
matter
i
have
to
speak
concerning
involves
honour
and
rank
life
and
means
of
living
nay
but
i
have
to
hear
and
judge
between
calezon
and
john
of
acqua
mortis
the
two
most
celebrated
troubadours
postpone
their
cause
till
said
margaret
and
dedicate
an
hour
or
two
to
more
important
affairs
if
you
are
peremptory
replied
king
rené
you
are
aware
my
child
i
can
not
say
you
nay
and
with
reluctance
he
gave
orders
for
the
hawkers
to
go
on
and
follow
their
sport
as
he
could
not
attend
them
that
day
the
old
king
then
suffered
himself
like
an
unwilling
greyhound
withheld
from
the
chase
to
be
led
into
a
separate
apartment
to
insure
privacy
margaret
stationed
her
secretary
mordaunt
with
arthur
in
an
antechamber
giving
them
orders
to
prevent
all
intrusion
nay
for
myself
margaret
said
the
old
man
since
it
must
be
i
consent
to
be
put
but
why
keep
old
mordaunt
from
taking
a
walk
in
this
beautiful
morning
and
why
prevent
young
arthur
from
going
forth
with
the
rest
i
promise
you
though
they
term
him
a
philosopher
yet
he
showed
as
light
a
pair
of
heels
last
night
with
the
young
countess
de
boisgelin
as
any
gallant
in
provence
they
are
come
from
a
country
said
margaret
in
which
men
are
trained
from
infancy
to
prefer
their
duty
to
their
pleasure
the
poor
king
led
into
the
saw
with
internal
shuddering
the
fatal
cabinet
of
ebony
bound
with
silver
which
had
never
been
opened
but
to
overwhelm
him
with
weariness
and
dolefully
calculated
how
many
yawns
he
must
strangle
ere
he
sustained
the
consideration
of
its
contents
they
proved
however
when
laid
before
him
of
a
kind
that
excited
even
his
interest
though
painfully
his
daughter
presented
him
with
a
short
and
clear
view
of
the
debts
which
were
secured
on
his
dominions
and
for
which
they
were
mortgaged
in
various
pieces
and
parcels
she
then
showed
him
by
another
schedule
the
large
claims
of
which
payment
was
instantly
demanded
to
discharge
which
no
funds
could
be
found
or
assigned
the
king
defended
himself
like
others
in
his
forlorn
situation
to
every
claim
of
six
seven
or
eight
thousand
ducats
he
replied
by
the
assertion
that
he
had
ten
thousand
crowns
in
his
chancery
and
showed
some
reluctance
to
be
convinced
till
repeatedly
urged
upon
him
that
the
same
sum
could
not
be
adequate
to
the
discharge
of
thirty
times
the
amount
then
said
the
king
somewhat
impatiently
why
not
pay
off
those
who
are
most
pressing
and
let
the
others
wait
till
receipts
come
round
it
is
a
practice
which
has
been
too
often
resorted
to
replied
the
queen
and
it
is
but
a
part
of
honesty
to
pay
creditors
who
have
advanced
their
all
in
your
grace
service
but
are
we
not
said
rené
king
of
both
the
sicilies
naples
arragon
and
jerusalem
and
why
is
the
monarch
of
such
fair
kingdoms
to
be
pushed
to
the
wall
like
a
bankrupt
yeoman
for
a
few
bags
of
paltry
crowns
you
are
indeed
monarch
of
these
kingdoms
said
margaret
but
is
it
necessary
to
remind
your
majesty
that
it
is
but
as
i
am
queen
of
england
in
which
i
have
not
an
acre
of
land
and
can
not
command
a
penny
of
revenue
you
have
no
dominions
which
are
a
source
of
revenue
save
those
which
you
see
in
this
scroll
with
an
exact
list
of
the
income
they
afford
it
is
totally
inadequate
you
see
to
maintain
your
state
and
to
pay
the
large
engagements
incurred
to
former
creditors
it
is
cruel
to
press
me
to
the
wall
thus
said
the
poor
king
what
can
i
do
if
i
am
poor
i
can
not
help
it
i
am
sure
i
would
pay
the
debts
you
talk
of
if
i
knew
the
way
royal
father
i
will
show
it
resign
your
useless
and
unavailing
dignity
which
with
the
pretensions
attending
it
serves
but
to
make
your
miseries
ridiculous
resign
your
rights
as
a
sovereign
and
the
income
which
can
not
be
stretched
out
to
the
empty
excesses
of
a
beggarly
court
will
enable
you
to
enjoy
in
ease
and
opulence
all
the
pleasures
you
most
delight
in
as
a
private
baron
margaret
you
speak
folly
answered
rené
somewhat
sternly
a
king
and
his
people
are
bound
by
ties
which
neither
can
sever
without
guilt
my
subjects
are
my
flock
i
am
their
shepherd
they
are
assigned
to
my
governance
by
heaven
and
i
dare
not
renounce
the
charge
of
protecting
them
were
you
in
condition
to
do
so
answered
the
queen
margaret
would
bid
you
fight
to
the
death
but
don
your
harness
long
disused
mount
your
cry
rené
for
provence
and
see
if
a
hundred
men
will
gather
round
your
standard
your
fortresses
are
in
the
hands
of
strangers
army
you
have
none
your
vassals
may
have
but
they
lack
all
military
skill
and
soldierlike
discipline
you
stand
but
the
mere
skeleton
of
monarchy
which
france
or
burgundy
may
prostrate
on
the
earth
whichever
first
puts
forth
his
arm
to
throw
it
down
the
tears
trickled
fast
down
the
old
king
cheeks
when
this
unflattering
prospect
was
set
before
him
and
he
could
not
forbear
owning
his
total
want
of
power
to
defend
himself
and
his
dominions
and
admitting
that
he
had
often
thought
of
the
necessity
of
compounding
for
his
resignation
with
one
of
his
powerful
neighbours
it
was
thy
interest
margaret
harsh
and
severe
as
you
are
which
prevented
my
entering
before
now
into
measures
most
painful
to
my
feelings
but
perhaps
best
calculated
for
my
advantage
but
i
had
hoped
it
would
hold
on
for
my
day
and
thou
my
child
with
the
talents
heaven
has
given
thee
wouldst
i
thought
have
found
remedy
for
distresses
which
i
can
not
escape
otherwise
than
by
shunning
the
thoughts
of
them
if
it
is
in
earnest
you
speak
of
my
interest
said
margaret
know
that
your
resigning
provence
will
satisfy
the
nearest
and
almost
the
only
wish
that
my
bosom
can
form
but
so
judge
me
heaven
as
it
is
on
your
account
gracious
sire
as
well
as
mine
that
i
advise
your
compliance
say
no
more
o
child
give
me
the
parchment
of
resignation
and
i
will
sign
it
i
see
thou
hast
it
ready
drawn
let
us
sign
it
and
then
we
will
overtake
the
hawkers
we
must
suffer
woe
but
there
is
little
need
to
sit
down
and
weep
for
it
do
you
not
ask
said
margaret
surprised
at
his
apathy
to
whom
you
cede
your
dominions
what
boots
it
answered
the
king
since
they
must
be
no
more
my
own
it
must
be
either
to
charles
of
burgundy
or
my
nephew
louis
both
powerful
and
politic
princes
god
send
my
poor
people
may
have
no
cause
to
wish
their
old
man
back
again
whose
only
pleasure
was
to
see
them
happy
and
mirthful
it
is
to
burgundy
you
resign
provence
said
margaret
i
would
have
preferred
him
answered
rené
he
is
fierce
but
not
malignant
one
word
more
are
my
subjects
privileges
and
immunities
fully
secured
amply
replied
the
queen
and
your
own
wants
of
all
kinds
honourably
provided
for
i
would
not
leave
the
stipulations
in
your
favour
in
blank
though
i
might
perhaps
have
trusted
charles
of
burgundy
where
money
alone
is
concerned
i
ask
not
for
myself
with
my
viol
and
my
pencil
rené
the
troubadour
will
be
as
happy
as
ever
was
rené
the
king
so
saying
with
practical
philosophy
he
whistled
the
burden
of
his
last
composed
ariette
and
signed
away
the
rest
of
his
royal
possessions
without
pulling
off
his
glove
or
even
reading
the
instrument
what
is
this
he
said
looking
at
another
and
separate
parchment
of
much
briefer
contents
must
my
kinsman
charles
have
both
the
sicilies
catalonia
naples
and
jerusalem
as
well
as
the
poor
remainder
of
provence
methinks
in
decency
some
greater
extent
of
parchment
should
have
been
allowed
to
so
ample
a
cession
that
deed
said
margaret
only
disowns
and
relinquishes
all
countenance
of
ferrand
de
vaudemont
rash
attempt
on
lorraine
and
renounces
all
quarrel
on
that
account
against
charles
of
burgundy
for
once
margaret
miscalculated
the
tractability
of
her
temper
rené
positively
started
coloured
and
stammered
with
passion
as
he
interrupted
her
disown
relinquish
renounce
the
cause
of
my
grandchild
the
son
of
my
dear
yolande
his
rightful
claims
on
his
mother
inheritance
margaret
i
am
ashamed
for
thee
thy
pride
is
an
excuse
for
thy
evil
temper
but
what
is
pride
worth
which
can
stoop
to
commit
an
act
of
dishonourable
meanness
to
desert
nay
disown
my
own
flesh
and
blood
because
the
youth
is
a
bold
knight
under
shield
and
disposed
to
battle
for
his
right
i
were
worthy
that
harp
and
horn
rung
out
shame
on
me
should
i
listen
to
thee
margaret
was
overcome
in
some
measure
by
the
old
man
unexpected
opposition
she
endeavoured
however
to
show
that
there
was
no
occasion
in
point
of
honour
why
rené
should
engage
in
the
cause
of
a
wild
adventurer
whose
right
be
it
good
be
it
bad
was
only
upheld
by
some
petty
and
underhand
supplies
of
money
from
france
and
the
countenance
of
a
few
of
the
restless
banditti
who
inhabit
the
borders
of
all
nations
but
ere
rené
could
answer
voices
raised
to
an
unusual
pitch
were
heard
in
the
antechamber
the
door
of
which
was
flung
open
by
an
armed
knight
covered
with
dust
who
exhibited
all
the
marks
of
a
long
journey
here
i
am
he
said
father
of
my
mother
behold
your
grandson
ferrand
de
vaudemont
the
son
of
your
lost
yolande
kneels
at
your
feet
and
implores
a
blessing
on
him
and
his
enterprise
thou
hast
it
replied
rené
and
may
it
prosper
with
thee
gallant
youth
image
of
thy
sainted
mother
my
blessings
my
prayers
my
hopes
go
with
you
and
you
fair
aunt
of
england
said
the
young
knight
addressing
margaret
you
who
are
yourself
dispossessed
by
traitors
will
you
not
own
the
cause
of
a
kinsman
who
is
struggling
for
his
inheritance
i
wish
all
good
to
your
person
fair
nephew
answered
the
queen
of
england
although
your
features
are
strange
to
me
but
to
advise
this
old
man
to
adopt
your
cause
when
it
is
desperate
in
the
eyes
of
all
wise
men
were
impious
madness
is
my
cause
then
so
desperate
said
ferrand
forgive
me
if
i
was
not
aware
of
it
and
does
my
aunt
margaret
say
this
whose
strength
of
mind
supported
lancaster
so
long
after
the
spirits
of
her
warriors
had
been
quelled
by
defeat
what
forgive
me
for
my
cause
must
be
pleaded
what
would
you
have
said
had
my
mother
yolande
been
capable
to
advise
her
father
to
disown
your
own
edward
had
god
permitted
him
to
reach
provence
in
safety
edward
said
margaret
weeping
as
she
spoke
was
incapable
of
desiring
his
friends
to
espouse
a
quarrel
that
was
irremediable
his
too
was
a
cause
for
which
mighty
princes
and
peers
laid
lance
in
rest
yet
heaven
blessed
it
not
said
vaudemont
thine
continued
margaret
is
but
embraced
by
the
robber
nobles
of
germany
the
upstart
burghers
of
the
rhine
cities
the
paltry
and
clownish
confederates
of
the
cantons
but
heaven
blessed
replied
vaudemont
know
proud
woman
that
i
come
to
interrupt
your
treacherous
intrigues
no
petty
adventurer
subsisting
and
maintaining
warfare
by
sleight
rather
than
force
but
a
conqueror
from
a
bloody
field
of
battle
in
which
heaven
has
tamed
the
pride
of
the
tyrant
of
burgundy
it
is
false
said
the
queen
starting
i
believe
it
not
it
is
true
said
de
vaudemont
as
true
as
heaven
is
above
it
is
four
days
since
i
left
the
field
of
granson
heaped
with
burgundy
mercenaries
his
wealth
his
jewels
his
plate
his
magnificent
decorations
the
prize
of
the
poor
swiss
who
scarce
can
tell
their
value
know
you
this
queen
margaret
continued
the
young
soldier
showing
the
jewel
which
decorated
the
duke
order
of
the
golden
fleece
think
you
not
the
lion
was
closely
hunted
when
he
left
such
trophies
as
these
behind
him
margaret
looked
with
dazzled
eyes
and
bewildered
thoughts
upon
a
token
which
confirmed
the
duke
defeat
and
the
extinction
of
her
last
hopes
her
father
on
the
contrary
was
struck
with
the
heroism
of
the
young
warrior
a
quality
which
except
as
it
existed
in
his
daughter
margaret
had
he
feared
taken
leave
of
his
family
admiring
in
his
heart
the
youth
who
exposed
himself
to
danger
for
the
meed
of
praise
almost
as
much
as
he
did
the
poets
by
whom
the
warrior
fame
is
rendered
immortal
he
hugged
his
grandson
to
his
bosom
bidding
him
gird
on
his
sword
in
strength
and
assuring
him
if
money
could
advance
his
affairs
he
king
rené
could
command
ten
thousand
crowns
any
part
or
the
whole
of
which
was
at
ferrand
command
thus
giving
proof
of
what
had
been
said
of
him
that
his
head
was
incapable
of
containing
two
ideas
at
the
same
time
we
return
to
arthur
who
with
the
queen
of
england
secretary
mordaunt
had
been
not
a
little
surprised
by
the
entrance
of
the
count
de
vaudemont
calling
himself
duke
of
lorraine
into
the
anteroom
in
which
they
kept
a
kind
of
guard
followed
by
a
tall
strong
swiss
with
a
huge
halberd
over
his
shoulder
the
prince
naming
himself
arthur
did
not
think
it
becoming
to
oppose
his
entrance
to
the
presence
of
his
grandfather
and
aunt
especially
as
it
was
obvious
that
his
opposition
must
have
created
an
affray
in
the
huge
staring
halberdier
who
had
sense
enough
to
remain
in
the
anteroom
arthur
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
recognise
sigismund
biederman
who
after
staring
wildly
at
him
for
a
moment
like
a
dog
which
suddenly
recognises
a
favourite
rushed
up
to
the
young
englishman
with
a
wild
cry
of
gladness
and
in
hurried
accents
told
him
how
happy
he
was
to
meet
with
him
and
that
he
had
matters
of
importance
to
tell
him
it
was
at
no
time
easy
for
sigismund
to
arrange
his
ideas
and
now
they
were
altogether
confused
by
the
triumphant
joy
which
he
expressed
for
the
recent
victory
of
his
countrymen
over
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
it
was
with
wonder
that
arthur
heard
his
confused
and
rude
but
faithful
tale
look
you
king
arthur
the
duke
had
come
up
with
his
huge
army
as
far
as
granson
which
is
near
the
outlet
of
the
great
lake
of
neufchatel
there
were
five
or
six
hundred
confederates
in
the
place
and
they
held
it
till
provisions
failed
and
then
you
know
they
were
forced
to
give
it
over
but
though
hunger
is
hard
to
bear
they
had
better
have
borne
it
a
day
or
two
longer
for
the
butcher
charles
hung
them
all
up
by
the
neck
upon
trees
round
the
place
and
there
was
no
swallowing
for
them
you
know
after
such
usage
as
that
meanwhile
all
was
busy
on
our
hills
and
every
man
that
had
a
sword
or
lance
accoutred
himself
with
it
we
met
at
neufchatel
and
some
germans
joined
us
with
the
noble
duke
of
lorraine
ah
king
arthur
there
is
a
leader
we
all
think
him
second
but
to
rudolph
of
donnerhugel
you
saw
him
even
now
it
was
he
that
went
into
that
room
and
you
saw
him
before
it
is
he
that
was
the
blue
knight
of
bâle
but
we
called
him
laurenz
then
for
rudolph
said
his
presence
among
us
must
not
be
known
to
our
father
and
i
did
not
know
myself
at
that
time
who
he
really
was
well
when
we
came
to
neufchatel
we
were
a
goodly
company
we
were
fifteen
thousand
stout
confederates
and
of
others
germans
and
lorraine
men
i
will
warrant
you
five
thousand
more
we
heard
that
the
burgundian
was
sixty
thousand
in
the
field
but
we
heard
at
the
same
time
that
charles
had
hung
up
our
brethren
like
dogs
and
the
man
was
not
among
us
among
the
confederates
i
mean
who
would
stay
to
count
heads
when
the
question
was
to
avenge
them
i
would
you
could
have
heard
the
roar
of
fifteen
thousand
swiss
demanding
to
be
led
against
the
butcher
of
their
brethren
my
father
himself
who
you
know
is
usually
so
eager
for
peace
now
gave
the
first
voice
for
battle
so
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
we
descended
the
lake
towards
granson
with
tears
in
our
eyes
and
weapons
in
our
hands
determined
to
have
death
or
vengeance
we
came
to
a
sort
of
strait
between
vauxmoreux
and
the
lake
there
were
horse
on
the
level
ground
between
the
mountain
and
the
lake
and
a
large
body
of
infantry
on
the
side
of
the
hill
the
duke
of
lorraine
and
his
followers
engaged
the
horse
while
we
climbed
the
hill
to
dispossess
the
infantry
it
was
with
us
the
affair
of
a
moment
every
man
of
us
was
at
home
among
the
crags
and
charles
men
were
stuck
among
them
as
thou
wert
arthur
when
thou
didst
first
come
to
geierstein
but
there
were
no
kind
maidens
to
lend
them
their
hands
to
help
them
down
no
no
there
were
pikes
clubs
and
halberds
many
a
one
to
dash
and
thrust
them
from
places
where
they
could
hardly
keep
their
feet
had
there
been
no
one
to
disturb
them
so
the
horsemen
pushed
by
the
lorrainers
and
seeing
us
upon
their
flanks
fled
as
fast
as
their
horses
could
carry
them
then
we
drew
together
again
on
a
fair
field
which
is
as
the
italian
says
where
the
hills
retire
from
the
lake
but
lo
you
we
had
scarce
arrayed
our
ranks
when
we
heard
such
a
din
and
clash
of
instruments
such
a
trample
of
their
great
horses
such
a
shouting
and
crying
of
men
as
if
all
the
soldiers
and
all
the
minstrels
in
france
and
germany
were
striving
which
should
make
the
loudest
noise
then
there
was
a
huge
cloud
of
dust
approaching
us
and
we
began
to
see
we
must
do
or
die
for
this
was
charles
and
his
whole
army
come
to
support
his
vanguard
a
blast
from
the
mountain
dispersed
the
dust
for
they
had
halted
to
prepare
for
battle
oh
good
arthur
you
would
have
given
ten
years
of
life
but
to
have
seen
the
sight
there
were
thousands
of
horse
all
in
complete
array
glancing
against
the
sun
and
hundreds
of
knights
with
crowns
of
gold
and
silver
on
their
helmets
and
thick
masses
of
spears
on
foot
and
cannon
as
they
call
them
i
did
not
know
what
things
they
were
which
they
drew
on
heavily
with
bullocks
and
placed
before
their
army
but
i
knew
more
of
them
before
the
morning
was
over
well
we
were
ordered
to
draw
up
in
a
hollow
square
as
we
are
taught
at
exercise
and
before
we
pushed
forwards
we
were
commanded
as
is
the
godly
rule
and
guise
of
our
warfare
to
kneel
down
and
pray
to
god
our
lady
and
the
blessed
saints
and
we
afterwards
learned
that
charles
in
his
arrogance
thought
we
asked
for
mercy
ha
ha
ha
a
proper
jest
if
my
father
once
knelt
to
him
it
was
for
the
sake
of
christian
blood
and
godly
peace
but
on
the
field
of
battle
arnold
biederman
would
not
have
knelt
to
him
and
his
whole
chivalry
though
he
had
stood
alone
with
his
sons
on
that
field
well
but
charles
supposing
we
asked
grace
was
determined
to
show
us
that
we
had
asked
it
at
a
graceless
face
for
he
cried
my
cannon
on
the
coward
slaves
it
is
all
the
mercy
they
have
to
expect
from
me
bang
bang
bang
off
went
the
things
i
told
you
of
like
thunder
and
lightning
and
some
mischief
they
did
but
the
less
that
we
were
kneeling
and
the
saints
doubtless
gave
the
huge
balls
a
hoist
over
the
heads
of
those
who
were
asking
grace
from
them
but
from
no
mortal
creatures
so
we
had
the
signal
to
rise
and
rush
on
and
i
promise
you
there
were
no
sluggards
every
man
felt
ten
men
strength
my
halberd
is
no
child
toy
if
you
have
forgotten
it
there
it
is
and
yet
it
trembled
in
my
grasp
as
if
it
had
been
a
willow
wand
to
drive
cows
with
on
we
went
when
suddenly
the
cannon
were
silent
and
the
earth
shook
with
another
and
continued
growl
and
battering
like
thunder
under
ground
it
was
the
rushing
to
charge
us
but
our
leaders
knew
their
trade
and
had
seen
such
a
sight
before
it
was
halt
halt
kneel
down
in
the
front
stoop
in
the
second
rank
close
shoulder
to
shoulder
like
brethren
lean
all
spears
forward
and
receive
them
like
an
iron
wall
on
they
rushed
and
there
was
a
rending
of
lances
that
would
have
served
the
unterwalden
old
women
with
splinters
of
firewood
for
a
twelvemonth
down
went
armed
horse
down
went
accoutred
knight
down
went
banner
and
bannerman
down
went
peaked
boot
and
crowned
helmet
and
of
those
who
fell
not
a
man
escaped
with
life
so
they
drew
off
in
confusion
and
were
getting
in
order
to
charge
again
when
the
noble
duke
ferrand
and
his
horsemen
dashed
at
them
in
their
own
way
and
we
moved
onward
to
support
him
thus
on
we
pressed
and
the
foot
hardly
waited
for
us
seeing
their
cavalry
so
handled
then
if
you
had
seen
the
dust
and
heard
the
blows
the
noise
of
a
hundred
thousand
thrashers
the
flight
of
the
chaff
which
they
drive
about
would
be
but
a
type
of
it
on
my
word
i
almost
thought
it
shame
to
dash
about
my
halberd
the
rout
was
so
helplessly
piteous
hundreds
were
slain
unresisting
and
the
whole
army
was
in
complete
flight
my
father
my
father
exclaimed
arthur
in
such
a
rout
what
can
have
become
of
him
he
escaped
safely
said
the
swiss
fled
with
charles
it
must
have
been
a
bloody
field
ere
he
fled
replied
the
englishman
nay
answered
sigismund
he
took
no
part
in
the
fight
but
merely
remained
by
charles
and
prisoners
said
it
was
well
for
us
for
that
he
is
a
man
of
great
counsel
and
action
in
the
wars
and
as
to
flying
a
man
in
such
a
matter
must
go
back
if
he
can
not
press
forward
and
there
is
no
shame
in
it
especially
if
you
be
not
engaged
in
your
own
person
as
he
spoke
thus
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
mordaunt
with
hush
hush
the
king
and
queen
come
forth
what
am
i
to
do
said
sigismund
in
some
alarm
i
care
not
for
the
duke
of
lorraine
but
what
am
i
to
do
when
kings
and
queens
enter
do
nothing
but
rise
unbonnet
yourself
and
be
silent
sigismund
did
as
he
was
directed
king
rené
came
forth
arm
in
arm
with
his
grandson
and
margaret
followed
with
deep
disappointment
and
vexation
on
her
brow
she
signed
to
arthur
as
she
passed
and
said
to
him
make
thyself
master
of
the
truth
of
this
most
unexpected
news
and
bring
the
particulars
to
me
mordaunt
will
introduce
thee
she
then
cast
a
look
on
the
young
swiss
and
replied
courteously
to
his
awkward
salutation
the
royal
party
then
left
the
room
rené
bent
on
carrying
his
grandson
to
the
which
had
been
interrupted
and
margaret
to
seek
the
solitude
of
her
private
apartment
and
await
the
confirmation
of
what
she
regarded
as
evil
tidings
they
were
no
sooner
passed
than
sigismund
observed
and
so
that
is
a
king
and
queen
peste
the
king
looks
somewhat
like
old
jacomo
the
violer
that
used
to
scrape
on
the
fiddle
to
us
when
he
came
to
geierstein
in
his
rounds
but
the
queen
is
a
stately
creature
the
chief
cow
of
the
herd
who
carries
the
bouquets
and
garlands
and
leads
the
rest
to
the
chalet
has
not
a
statelier
pace
and
how
deftly
you
approached
her
and
spoke
to
her
i
could
not
have
done
it
with
so
much
grace
but
it
is
like
that
you
have
served
apprentice
to
the
court
trade
leave
that
for
the
present
good
sigismund
answered
arthur
and
tell
me
more
of
this
battle
by
mary
but
i
must
have
some
victuals
and
drink
first
said
sigismund
if
your
credit
in
this
fine
place
reaches
so
far
doubt
it
not
sigismund
said
arthur
and
by
the
intervention
of
mordaunt
he
easily
procured
in
a
more
retired
apartment
a
collation
and
wine
to
which
the
young
biederman
did
great
honour
smacking
his
lips
with
much
gusto
after
the
delicious
wines
to
which
in
spite
of
his
father
ascetic
precepts
his
palate
was
beginning
to
be
considerably
formed
and
habituated
when
he
found
himself
alone
with
a
flask
of
and
a
biscuit
and
his
friend
arthur
he
was
easily
led
to
continue
his
tale
of
conquest
well
where
was
i
oh
where
we
broke
their
infantry
well
they
never
rallied
and
fell
into
greater
confusion
at
every
step
and
we
might
have
slaughtered
one
half
of
them
had
we
not
stopped
to
examine
charles
camp
mercy
on
us
arthur
what
a
sight
was
there
every
pavilion
was
full
of
rich
clothes
splendid
armour
and
great
dishes
and
flagons
which
some
men
said
were
of
silver
but
i
knew
there
was
not
so
much
silver
in
the
world
and
was
sure
they
must
be
of
pewter
rarely
burnished
here
there
were
hosts
of
laced
lackeys
and
grooms
and
pages
and
as
many
attendants
as
there
were
soldiers
in
the
army
and
thousands
for
what
i
knew
of
pretty
maidens
by
the
same
token
both
menials
and
maidens
placed
themselves
at
the
disposal
of
the
victors
but
i
promise
you
that
my
father
was
right
severe
on
any
who
would
abuse
the
rights
of
war
but
some
of
our
young
men
did
not
mind
him
till
he
taught
them
obedience
with
the
staff
of
his
halberd
well
arthur
there
was
fine
plundering
for
the
germans
and
french
that
were
with
us
rifled
everything
and
some
of
our
men
followed
the
example
it
is
very
catching
so
i
got
into
charles
own
pavilion
where
rudolph
and
some
of
his
people
were
trying
to
keep
out
every
one
that
he
might
have
the
spoiling
of
it
himself
i
think
but
neither
he
nor
any
bernese
of
them
all
dared
lay
truncheon
over
my
pate
so
i
entered
and
saw
them
putting
piles
of
so
clean
as
to
look
like
silver
into
chests
and
trunks
i
pressed
through
them
into
the
inner
place
and
there
was
i
will
do
him
justice
it
was
the
only
hard
one
in
his
camp
and
there
were
fine
sparkling
stones
and
pebbles
lying
about
among
gauntlets
boots
vambraces
and
suchlike
gear
so
i
thought
of
your
father
and
you
and
looked
for
something
when
what
should
i
see
but
my
old
friend
here
here
he
drew
queen
margaret
necklace
from
his
bosom
which
i
knew
because
you
remember
i
recovered
it
from
the
scharfgerichter
at
you
pretty
sparklers
said
i
shall
be
burgundian
no
longer
but
go
back
to
my
honest
english
friends
and
therefore
it
is
of
immense
value
said
arthur
and
belongs
not
to
my
father
or
to
me
but
to
the
queen
you
saw
but
now
and
she
will
become
it
rarely
answered
sigismund
were
she
but
a
score
or
a
score
and
a
half
years
younger
she
were
a
gallant
wife
for
a
swiss
landholder
i
would
warrant
her
to
keep
his
household
in
high
order
she
will
reward
thee
liberally
for
recovering
her
property
said
arthur
scarce
suppressing
a
smile
at
the
idea
of
the
proud
margaret
becoming
the
housewife
of
a
swiss
shepherd
how
reward
said
the
swiss
bethink
thee
i
am
sigismund
biederman
the
son
of
the
landamman
of
unterwalden
i
am
not
a
base
lanzknecht
to
be
paid
for
courtesy
with
piastres
let
her
grant
me
a
kind
word
of
thanks
or
the
matter
of
a
kiss
and
i
am
well
contented
a
kiss
of
her
hand
perhaps
said
arthur
again
smiling
at
his
friend
simplicity
umph
the
hand
well
it
may
do
for
a
queen
of
some
fifty
years
and
odd
but
would
be
poor
homage
to
a
queen
of
may
arthur
here
brought
back
the
youth
to
the
subject
of
his
battle
and
learned
that
the
slaughter
of
the
duke
forces
in
the
flight
had
been
in
no
degree
equal
to
the
importance
of
the
action
many
rode
off
on
horseback
said
sigismund
and
our
german
flew
on
the
spoil
when
they
should
have
followed
the
chase
and
besides
to
speak
truth
charles
camp
delayed
our
very
selves
in
the
pursuit
but
had
we
gone
half
a
mile
farther
and
seen
our
friends
hanging
on
trees
not
a
confederate
would
have
stopped
from
the
chase
while
he
had
limbs
to
carry
him
in
pursuit
and
what
has
become
of
the
duke
charles
has
retreated
into
burgundy
like
a
boar
who
has
felt
the
touch
of
the
spear
and
is
more
enraged
than
hurt
but
is
they
say
sad
and
sulky
others
report
that
he
has
collected
all
his
scattered
army
and
immense
forces
besides
and
has
screwed
his
subjects
to
give
him
money
so
that
we
may
expect
another
brush
but
all
switzerland
will
join
us
after
such
a
victory
and
my
father
is
with
him
said
arthur
truly
he
is
and
has
in
a
right
godly
manner
tried
to
set
afoot
a
treaty
of
peace
with
my
own
father
but
it
will
scarce
succeed
charles
is
as
mad
as
ever
and
our
people
are
right
proud
of
our
victory
and
so
they
well
may
nevertheless
my
father
forever
preaches
that
such
victories
and
such
heaps
of
wealth
will
change
our
ancient
manners
and
that
the
ploughman
will
leave
his
labour
to
turn
soldier
he
says
much
about
it
but
why
money
choice
meat
and
wine
and
fine
clothing
should
do
so
much
harm
i
can
not
bring
my
poor
brains
to
see
and
many
better
heads
than
mine
are
as
much
here
to
you
friend
arthur
this
is
choice
liquor
and
what
brings
you
and
your
general
prince
ferrand
post
to
nancy
said
the
young
englishman
faith
you
are
yourself
the
cause
of
our
journey
i
the
cause
said
why
how
could
that
be
why
it
is
said
you
and
queen
margaret
are
urging
this
old
fiddling
king
rené
to
yield
up
his
territories
to
charles
and
to
disown
ferrand
in
his
claim
upon
lorraine
and
the
duke
of
lorraine
sent
a
man
that
you
know
well
that
is
you
do
not
know
but
you
know
some
of
his
family
and
he
knows
more
of
you
than
you
wot
to
put
a
spoke
in
your
wheel
and
prevent
your
getting
for
charles
the
county
of
provence
or
preventing
ferrand
being
troubled
or
traversed
in
his
natural
rights
over
lorraine
on
my
word
sigismund
i
can
not
comprehend
you
said
arthur
well
replied
the
swiss
my
lot
is
a
hard
one
all
our
house
say
that
i
can
comprehend
nothing
and
i
shall
be
next
told
that
nobody
can
comprehend
well
in
plain
language
i
mean
my
uncle
count
albert
as
he
calls
himself
of
geierstein
my
father
brother
anne
of
geierstein
father
echoed
arthur
ay
truly
i
thought
we
should
find
some
mark
to
make
you
know
him
by
but
i
never
saw
him
ay
but
you
have
though
an
able
man
he
is
and
knows
more
of
every
man
business
than
the
man
does
himself
oh
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
salamander
pshaw
sigismund
how
can
you
believe
that
nonsense
answered
arthur
rudolph
told
me
you
were
as
much
bewildered
as
i
was
that
night
at
answered
the
swiss
if
i
were
so
i
was
the
greater
ass
for
my
pains
answered
arthur
well
but
this
uncle
of
mine
has
got
some
of
the
old
conjuring
books
from
the
library
at
arnheim
and
they
say
he
can
pass
from
place
to
place
with
more
than
mortal
speed
and
that
he
is
helped
in
his
designs
by
mightier
counsellors
than
mere
men
always
however
though
so
able
and
highly
endowed
his
gifts
whether
coming
from
a
lawful
or
unlawful
quarter
bring
him
no
abiding
advantage
he
is
eternally
plunged
into
strife
and
danger
i
know
few
particulars
of
his
life
said
arthur
disguising
as
much
as
he
could
his
anxiety
to
hear
more
of
him
but
i
have
heard
that
he
left
switzerland
to
join
the
emperor
true
answered
the
young
swiss
and
married
the
young
baroness
of
arnheim
but
afterwards
he
incurred
my
namesake
imperial
displeasure
and
not
less
that
of
the
duke
of
austria
they
say
you
can
not
live
in
rome
and
strive
with
the
pope
so
my
uncle
thought
it
best
to
cross
the
rhine
and
betake
himself
to
charles
court
who
willingly
received
noblemen
from
all
countries
so
that
they
had
good
sounding
names
with
the
title
of
count
marquis
baron
or
suchlike
to
march
in
front
of
them
so
my
uncle
was
most
kindly
received
but
within
this
year
or
two
all
this
friendship
has
been
broken
up
uncle
albert
obtained
a
great
lead
in
some
mysterious
societies
of
which
charles
disapproved
and
set
so
hard
at
my
poor
uncle
that
he
was
fain
to
take
orders
and
shave
his
hair
rather
than
lose
his
head
but
though
he
cut
off
his
hair
his
brain
remains
as
busy
as
ever
and
although
the
duke
suffered
him
to
be
at
large
yet
he
found
him
so
often
in
his
way
that
all
men
believed
he
waited
but
an
excuse
for
seizing
upon
him
and
putting
him
to
death
but
my
uncle
persists
that
he
fears
not
charles
and
that
duke
as
he
is
charles
has
more
occasion
to
be
afraid
of
and
so
you
saw
how
boldly
he
played
his
part
at
la
ferette
by
george
of
windsor
exclaimed
arthur
the
black
priest
of
st
paul
oho
you
understand
me
now
well
he
took
it
upon
him
that
charles
would
not
dare
to
punish
him
for
his
share
in
de
hagenbach
death
and
no
more
did
he
although
uncle
albert
sat
and
voted
in
the
estates
of
burgundy
and
stirred
them
up
all
he
could
to
refuse
giving
charles
the
money
he
asked
of
them
but
when
the
swiss
war
broke
out
uncle
albert
became
assured
his
being
a
clergyman
would
be
no
longer
his
protection
and
that
the
duke
intended
to
have
him
accused
of
corresponding
with
his
brother
and
countrymen
and
so
he
appeared
suddenly
in
ferrand
camp
at
neufchatel
and
sent
a
message
to
charles
that
he
renounced
his
allegiance
and
bid
him
defiance
a
singular
story
of
an
active
and
versatile
man
said
the
young
englishman
oh
you
may
seek
the
world
for
a
man
like
uncle
albert
then
he
knows
everything
and
he
told
duke
ferrand
what
you
were
about
here
and
offered
to
go
and
bring
more
certain
information
ay
though
he
left
the
swiss
camp
but
five
or
six
days
before
the
battle
and
the
distance
between
arles
and
neufchatel
be
four
hundred
miles
complete
yet
he
met
him
on
his
return
when
duke
ferrand
with
me
to
show
him
the
way
was
hastening
hitherward
having
set
off
from
the
very
field
of
battle
met
him
said
arthur
met
whom
met
the
black
priest
of
st
paul
ay
i
mean
so
replied
sigismund
but
he
was
habited
as
a
carmelite
monk
a
carmelite
said
arthur
a
sudden
light
flashing
on
him
and
i
was
so
blind
as
to
recommend
his
services
to
the
queen
i
remember
well
that
he
kept
his
face
much
concealed
in
his
cowl
and
i
foolish
beast
to
fall
so
grossly
into
the
snare
and
yet
perhaps
it
is
as
well
the
transaction
was
interrupted
since
i
fear
if
carried
successfully
through
all
must
have
been
disconcerted
by
this
astounding
defeat
their
conversation
had
thus
far
proceeded
when
mordaunt
appearing
summoned
arthur
to
his
royal
mistress
apartment
in
that
gay
palace
a
gloomy
room
whose
windows
looked
upon
some
part
of
the
ruins
of
the
roman
edifice
but
excluded
every
other
object
save
broken
walls
and
tottering
columns
was
the
retreat
which
margaret
had
chosen
for
her
own
she
received
albert
with
a
kindness
more
touching
that
it
was
the
inmate
of
so
proud
and
fiery
a
disposition
of
a
heart
assailed
with
many
woes
and
feeling
them
severely
alas
poor
arthur
she
said
thy
life
begins
where
thy
threatens
to
end
in
useless
labour
to
save
a
sinking
vessel
the
rushing
leak
pours
in
its
waters
faster
than
human
force
can
lighten
or
discharge
all
all
goes
wrong
when
our
unhappy
cause
becomes
connected
with
it
strength
becomes
weakness
wisdom
folly
and
valour
cowardice
the
duke
of
burgundy
hitherto
victorious
in
all
his
bold
undertakings
has
but
to
entertain
the
momentary
thought
of
yielding
succour
to
lancaster
and
behold
his
sword
is
broken
by
a
peasant
flail
and
his
disciplined
army
held
to
be
the
finest
in
the
world
flies
like
chaff
before
the
wind
while
their
spoils
are
divided
by
renegade
german
hirelings
and
barbarous
alpine
shepherds
what
more
hast
thou
learned
of
this
strange
tale
little
madam
but
what
you
have
heard
the
worst
additions
are
that
the
battle
was
shamefully
cowardlike
and
completely
lost
with
every
advantage
to
have
won
it
the
best
that
the
burgundian
army
has
been
rather
dispersed
than
destroyed
and
that
the
duke
himself
has
escaped
and
is
rallying
his
forces
in
upper
burgundy
to
sustain
a
new
defeat
or
engage
in
a
protracted
and
doubtful
contest
fatal
to
his
reputation
as
defeat
itself
where
is
thy
father
with
the
duke
madam
as
i
have
been
informed
replied
arthur
hie
to
him
and
say
i
charge
him
to
look
after
his
own
safety
and
care
no
further
for
my
interests
this
last
blow
has
sunk
me
i
am
without
an
ally
without
a
friend
without
treasure
not
so
madam
replied
arthur
one
piece
of
good
fortune
has
brought
back
to
your
grace
this
inestimable
relic
of
your
fortunes
and
producing
the
precious
necklace
he
gave
the
history
of
its
recovery
i
rejoice
at
the
chance
which
has
restored
these
diamonds
said
the
queen
that
in
point
of
gratitude
at
least
i
may
not
be
utterly
bankrupt
carry
them
to
your
father
tell
him
my
schemes
are
over
and
my
heart
which
so
long
clung

the

are
his

to
his

use
let
him
apply
them
they
will
but
poorly
repay
the
noble
earldom
of
oxford
lost
in
the
cause
of
her
who

them
royal
madam
said
the
youth
be
assured
my
father
would
sooner
live
by
service
as
a
than
become
a
burden
on
your
misfortunes
he
never
yet
disobeyed
command
of
mine
said
margaret
and
this
is
the
last
i
will
lay
upon
him
if
he
is
too
rich
or
too
proud
to
benefit
by
his
queen
behest
he
will
find
enough
of
poor
lancastrians
who
have
fewer
means
or
fewer
scruples
there
is
yet
a
circumstance
i
have
to
communicate
said
arthur
and
recounted
the
history
of
albert
of
geierstein
and
the
disguise
of
a
carmelite
monk
are
you
such
a
fool
answered
the
queen
as
to
suppose
this
man
has
any
supernatural
powers
to
aid
him
in
his
ambitious
projects
and
his
hasty
journeys
no
madam
but
it
is
whispered
that
the
count
albert
of
geierstein
or
this
black
priest
of
paul
is
a
chief
amongst
the
secret
societies
of
germany
which
even
princes
dread
whilst
they
hate
them
for
the
man
that
can
command
a
hundred
daggers
must
be
feared
even
by
those
who
rule
thousands
of
swords
can
this
person
said
the
queen
being
now
a
churchman
retain
authority
amongst
those
who
deal
in
life
and
death
it
is
contrary
to
the
canons
it
would
seem
so
royal
madam
but
everything
in
these
dark
institutions
differs
from
what
is
practised
in
the
light
of
day
prelates
are
often
heads
of
a
vehmique
bench
and
the
archbishop
of
cologne
exercises
the
dreadful
office
of
their
chief
as
duke
of
westphalia
the
principal
region
in
which
these
societies
flourish
such
privileges
attach
to
the
secret
influence
of
the
chiefs
of
this
dark
association
as
may
well
seem
supernatural
to
those
who
are
unapprised
of
circumstances
of
which
men
shun
to
speak
in
plain
terms
let
him
be
wizard
or
assassin
said
the
queen
i
thank
him
for
having
contributed
to
interrupt
my
plan
of
the
old
man
cession
of
provence
which
as
events
stand
would
have
stripped
rené
of
his
dominions
without
furthering
our
plan
of
invading

more
be
stirring
with
the
dawn
and
bend
thy
way
back
to
thy
father
and
charge
him
to
care
for
himself
and
think
no
more
of
me
bretagne
where
the
heir
of
lancaster
resides
will
be
the
safest
place
of

for
its
bravest
followers
along
the
rhine
the
invisible
tribunal
it
would
seem
haunts
both
shores
and
to
be
innocent
of
ill
is
no
security
even
here
the
proposed
treaty
with
burgundy
may
take
air
and
the
provençaux
carry
daggers
as
well
as
crooks
and
pipes
but
i
hear
the
horses
fast
returning
from
the
and
the
silly
old
man
forgetting
all
the
eventful
proceedings
of
the
day
whistling
as
he
ascends
the
steps
well
we
will
soon
part
and
my
removal
will
be
i
think
a
relief
to
him
prepare
for
banquet
and
ball
for
noise
and
nonsense
above
all
to
bid
adieu
to
aix
with
morning
dawn
thus
dismissed
from
the
queen
presence
arthur
first
care
was
to
summon
thiebault
to
have
all
things
in
readiness
for
his
departure
his
next
to
prepare
himself
for
the
pleasures
of
the
evening
not
perhaps
so
heavily
affected
by
the
failure
of
his
negotiation
as
to
be
incapable
of
consolation
in
such
a
scene
for
the
truth
was
that
his
mind
secretly
revolted
at
the
thoughts
of
the
simple
old
king
being
despoiled
of
his
dominions
to
further
an
invasion
of
england
in
which
whatever
interest
he
might
have
in
his
daughter
rights
there
was
little
chance
of
success
if
such
feelings
were
censurable
they
had
their
punishment
although
few
knew
how
completely
the
arrival
of
the
duke
of
lorraine
and
the
intelligence
he
brought
with
him
had
disconcerted
the
plans
of
queen
margaret
it
was
well
known
there
had
been
little
love
betwixt
the
queen
and
his
mother
yolande
and
the
young
prince
found
himself
at
the
head
of
a
numerous
party
in
the
court
of
his
grandfather
who
disliked
his
aunt
haughty
manners
and
were
wearied
by
the
unceasing
melancholy
of
her
looks
and
conversation
and
her
undisguised
contempt
of
the
frivolities
which
passed
around
her
ferrand
besides
was
young
handsome
a
victor
just
arrived
from
a
field
of
battle
fought
gloriously
and
gained
against
all
chances
to
the
contrary
that
he
was
a
general
favourite
and
excluded
arthur
philipson
as
an
adherent
of
the
unpopular
queen
from
the
notice
her
influence
had
on
a
former
evening
procured
him
was
only
a
natural
consequence
of
their
relative
condition
but
what
somewhat
hurt
arthur
feelings
was
to
see
his
friend
sigismund
the
simple
as
his
brethren
called
him
shining
with
the
reflected
glory
of
the
duke
ferrand
of
lorraine
who
introduced
to
all
the
ladies
present
the
gallant
young
swiss
as
count
sigismund
of
geierstein
his
care
had
procured
for
his
follower
a
dress
rather
more
suitable
for
such
a
scene
than
the
country
attire
of
the
count
otherwise
sigismund
biederman
for
a
certain
time
whatever
of
novelty
is
introduced
into
society
is
pleasing
though
it
has
nothing
else
to
recommend
it
the
swiss
were
little
known
personally
out
of
their
own
country
but
they
were
much
talked
of
it
was
a
recommendation
to
be
of
that
country
manners
were
blunt
a
mixture
of
awkwardness
and
rudeness
which
was
termed
frankness
during
the
moment
of
his
favour
he
spoke
bad
french
and
worse
italian
it
gave
naïveté
to
all
he
said
his
limbs
were
too
bulky
to
be
elegant
his
dancing
for
count
sigismund
failed
not
to
dance
was
the
bounding
and
gambolling
of
a
young
elephant
yet
they
were
preferred
to
the
handsome
proportions
and
courtly
movements
of
the
youthful
englishman
even
by
the
countess
in
whose
good
graces
arthur
had
made
some
progress
on
the
preceding
evening
arthur
thus
thrown
into
the
shade
felt
as
pepys
afterwards
did
when
he
tore
his
camlet
cloak
the
damage
was
not
great
but
it
troubled
him
nevertheless
the
passing
evening
brought
him
some
revenge
there
are
some
works
of
art
the
defects
of
which
are
not
seen
till
they
are
injudiciously
placed
in
too
strong
a
light
and
such
was
the
case
with
sigismund
the
simple
the
though
fantastic
provençaux
soon
found
out
the
heaviness
of
his
intellect
and
the
extent
of
his
and
amused
themselves
at
his
expense
by
ironical
compliments
and
raillery
it
is
probable
they
would
have
been
less
delicate
on
the
subject
had
not
the
swiss
brought
into
the
along
with
him
his
eternal
halberd
the
size
and
weight
and
thickness
of
which
boded
little
good
to
any
one
whom
the
owner
might
detect
in
the
act
of
making
merry
at
his
expense
but
sigismund
did
no
further
mischief
that
night
except
that
in
achieving
a
superb
he
alighted
with
his
whole
weight
on
the
miniature
foot
of
his
pretty
partner
which
he
crushed
to
pieces
arthur
had
hitherto
avoided
looking
towards
queen
margaret
during
the
course
of
the
evening
lest
he
should
disturb
her
thoughts
from
the
channel
in
which
they
were
rolling
by
seeming
to
lay
a
claim
on
her
protection
but
there
was
something
so
whimsical
in
the
awkward
physiognomy
of
the
maladroit
swiss
that
he
could
not
help
glancing
an
eye
to
the
alcove
where
the
queen
chair
of
state
was
placed
to
see
if
she
observed
him
the
very
first
view
was
such
as
to
rivet
his
attention
margaret
head
was
reclined
on
the
chair
her
eyes
scarcely
open
her
features
drawn
up
and
pinched
her
hands
closed
with
effort
the
english
lady
of
honour
who
stood
behind
her
old
deaf
and
had
not
discovered
anything
in
her
position
more
than
the
abstracted
and
indifferent
attitude
with
which
the
queen
was
wont
to
be
present
in
body
and
absent
in
mind
during
the
festivities
of
the
provençal
court
but
when
arthur
greatly
alarmed
came
behind
the
seat
to
press
her
attention
to
her
mistress
she
exclaimed
after
a
minute
investigation
mother
of
heaven
the
queen
is
dead
and
it
was
so
it
seemed
that
the
last
fibre
of
life
in
that
fiery
and
ambitious
mind
had
as
she
herself
prophesied
given
way
at
the
same
time

the
last
thread
of
political
hope

the

by
disposing
of
jewels
and
living
at
small
expense
had
realised
the
means
of
making
a
decent
provision
for

for
her
very
few
english

her
diamond

described
in

arthur

to

prosecution

they
had
been
destined
to
advance
or
if
that
should
prove
impossible
to
their
own
use
and
profit
the
charge
of
her
funeral
rites
was
wholly
intrusted
to
arthur
called
philipson
with
a
request
that
they
should
be
conducted
entirely
after
the
forms
observed
in

this
trust
was
expressed
in
an
addition
to
her
will
signed
the
very
day
on
which
she
died
arthur
lost
no
time
in
despatching
thiebault
express
to
his
father
with
a
letter
explaining
in
such
terms
as
he
knew
would
be
understood
the
tenor
of
all
that
had
happened
since
he
came
to
aix
and
above
all
the
death
of
queen
margaret
finally
he
requested
directions
for
his
motions
since
the
necessary
delay
occupied
by
the
obsequies
of
a
person
of
such
eminent
rank
must
detain
him
at
aix
till
he
should
receive
them
the
old
king
sustained
the
shock
of
his
daughter
death
so
easily
that
on
the
second
day
after
the
event
he
was
engaged
in
arranging
a
pompous
procession
for
the
funeral
and
composing
an
elegy
to
be
sung
to
a
tune
also
of
his
own
composing
in
honour
of
the
deceased
queen
who
was
likened
to
the
goddesses
of
heathen
mythology
and
to
judith
deborah
and
all
the
other
holy
women
not
to
mention
the
saints
of
the
christian
dispensation
it
can
not
be
concealed
that
when
the
first
burst
of
grief
was
over
king
rené
could
not
help
feeling
that
margaret
death
cut
a
political
knot
which
he
might
have
otherwise
found
it
difficult
to
untie
and
permitted
him
to
take
open
part
with
his
grandson
so
far
indeed
as
to
afford
him
a
considerable
share
of
the
contents
of
the
provençal
treasury
which
amounted
to
no
larger
sum
than
ten
thousand
crowns
ferrand
having
received
the
blessing
of
his
grandfather
in
a
form
which
his
affairs
rendered

he
commanded

with
him
after
a
most
loving
farewell
to

stout
but
young
swiss
sigismund
biederman
the
little
court
of
aix
were
left
to
their
mourning
king
rené
for
whom
ceremonial
and
show
whether
of
a
joyful
or
melancholy
character
was
always
matter
of
importance
would
willingly
have
bestowed
on
solemnising
the
obsequies
of
his
daughter
margaret
what
remained
of
his
revenue
but
was
prevented
from
doing
so
partly
by
remonstrances
from
his
ministers
partly
by
the
obstacles
opposed
by
the
young
englishman
who
acting
upon
the
presumed
will
of
the
dead
interfered
to
prevent
any
such
fantastic
exhibitions
being
produced
at
the
obsequies
of
the
queen
as
had
disgusted
her
during
her
life
the
funeral
therefore
after
many
days
had
been
spent
in
public
prayers
and
acts
of
devotion
was
solemnised
with
the
mournful
magnificence
due
to
the
birth
of
the
deceased
and
with
which
the
church
of
rome
so
well
knows
how
to
affect
at
once
the
eye
ear
and
feelings
amid
the
various
nobles
who
assisted
on
the
solemn
occasion
there
was
one
who
arrived
just
as
the
tolling
of
the
great
bells
of
sauveur
had
announced
that
the
procession
was
already
on
its
way
to
the
cathedral
the
stranger
hastily
exchanged
his
for
a
suit
of
deep
mourning
which
was
made
after
the
fashion
proper
to
england
so
attired
he
repaired
to
the
cathedral
where
the
noble
mien
of
the
cavalier
imposed
such
respect
on
the
attendants
that
he
was
permitted
to
approach
close
to
the
side
of
the
bier
and
it
was
across
the
coffin
of
the
queen
for
whom
he
had
acted
and
suffered
so
much
that
the
gallant
earl
of
oxford
exchanged
a
melancholy
glance
with
his
son
the
assistants
especially
the
english
servants
of
margaret
gazed
on
them
both
with
respect
and
wonder
and
the
elder
cavalier
in
particular
seemed
to
them
no
unapt
representative
of
the
faithful
subjects
of
england
paying
their
last
duty
at
the
tomb
of
her
who
had
so
long
swayed
the
sceptre
if
not
faultlessly
yet
always
with
a
bold
and
resolved
hand
the
last
sound
of
the
solemn
dirge
had
died
away
and
almost
all
the
funeral
attendants
had
retired
when
the
father
and
son
still
lingered
in
mournful
silence
beside
the
remains
of
their
sovereign
the
clergy
at
length
approached
and
intimated
they
were
about
to
conclude
the
last
duties
by
removing
the
body
which
had
been
lately
occupied
and
animated
by
so
haughty
and
restless
a
spirit
to
the
dust
darkness
and
silence
of
the
vault
where
the
counts
of
provence
awaited
dissolution
six
priests
raised
the
bier
on
their
shoulders
others
bore
huge
waxen
torches
before
and
behind
the
body
as
they
carried
it
down
a
private
staircase
which
yawned
in
the
floor
to
admit
their
descent
the
last
notes
of
the
requiem
in
which
the
churchmen
joined
had
died
away
along
the
high
and
fretted
arches
of
the
cathedral
the
last
flash
of
light
which
arose
from
the
mouth
of
the
vault
had
glimmered
and
disappeared
when
the
earl
of
oxford
taking
his
son
by
the
arm
led
him
in
silence
forth
into
a
small
cloistered
court
behind
the
building
where
they
found
themselves
alone
they
were
silent
for
a
few
minutes
for
both
and
particularly
the
father
were
deeply
affected
at
length
the
earl
spoke
and
this
then
is
her
end
said
he
here
royal
lady
all
that
we
have
planned
and
pledged
life
upon
falls
to
pieces
with
thy
dissolution
the
heart
of
resolution
the
head
of
policy
is
gone
and
what
avails
it
that
the
limbs
of
the
enterprise
still
have
motion
and
life
alas
margaret
of
anjou
may
heaven
reward
thy
virtues
and
absolve
thee
from
the
consequence
of
thine
errors
both
belonged
to
thy
station
and
if
thou
didst
hoist
too
high
a
sail
in
prosperity
never
lived
there
princess
who
defied
more
proudly
the
storms
of
adversity
or
bore
up
against
them
with
such
dauntless
nobility
of
determination
with
this
event
the
drama
has
closed
and
our
parts
my
son
are
ended
we
bear
arms
then
against
the
infidels
my
lord
said
arthur
with
a
sigh
that
was
however
hardly
audible
not
answered
the
earl
until
i
learn
that
henry
of
richmond
the
undoubted
heir
of
the
house
of
lancaster
has
no
occasion
for
my
services
in
these
jewels
of
which
you
wrote
me
so
strangely
lost
and
recovered
i
may
be
able
to
supply
him
with
resources
more
needful
than
either
your
services
or
mine
but
i
return
no
more
to
the
camp
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
for
in
him
there
is
no
help
can
it
be
possible
that
the
power
of
so
great
a
sovereign
has
been
overthrown
in
one
fatal
battle
said

and

rios
by
no
means
replied
his
father
the
loss
at
granson
was
very
great
but
to
the
strength
of
burgundy
it
is
but
a
scratch
on
the
shoulders
of
a
giant
it
is
the
spirit
of
charles
himself
his
wisdom
at
least
and
his
foresight
which
have
given
way
under
the
mortification
of
a
defeat
by
such
as
he
accounted
inconsiderable
enemies
and
expected
to
have
trampled
down
with
a
few
squadrons
of
his
then
his
temper
is
become
froward
peevish
and
arbitrary
devoted
to
those
who
flatter
and
as
there
is
too
much
reason
to
believe
betray
him
and
suspicious
of
those
counsellors
who
give
him
wholesome
advice
even
i
have
had
my
share
of
distrust
thou
knowest
i
refused
to
bear
arms
against
our
late
hosts
the
swiss
and
he
saw
in
that
no
reason
for
rejecting
my
attendance
on
his
march
but
since
the
defeat
of
granson
i
have
observed
a
strong
and
sudden
change
owing
perhaps
in
some
degree
to
the
insinuations
of
and
not
a
little
to
the
injured
pride
of
the
duke
who
was
unwilling
that
an
indifferent
person
in
my
situation
and
thinking
as
i
do
should
witness
the
disgrace
of
his
arms
he
spoke
in
my
hearing
of
lukewarm
friends
neutrals
of
those
who
not
being
with
him
must
be
against
him
i
tell
thee
arthur
de
vere
the
duke
has
said
that
which
touched
my
honour
so
nearly
that
nothing
but
the
commands
of
queen
margaret
and
the
interests
of
the
house
of
lancaster
could
have
made
me
remain
in
his
camp
that
is
over
my
royal
mistress
has
no
more
occasion
for
my
poor
services
the
duke
can
spare
no
aid
to
our
cause
and
if
he
could
we
can
no
longer
dispose
of
the
only
bribe
which
might
have
induced
him
to
afford
us
succours
the
power
of
seconding
his
views
on
provence
is
buried
with
margaret
of
anjou
what
then
is
your
purpose
demanded
his
son
i
propose
said
oxford
to
wait
at
the
court
of
king
rené
until
i
can
hear
from
the
earl
of
richmond
as
we
must
still
call
him
i
am
aware
that
banished
men
are
rarely
welcome
at
the
court
of
a
foreign
prince
but
i
have
been
the
faithful
follower
of
his
daughter
margaret
i
only
propose
to
reside
in
disguise
and
desire
neither
notice
nor
maintenance
so
methinks
king
rené
will
not
refuse
to
permit
me
to
breathe
the
air
of
his
dominions
until
i
learn
in
what
direction
fortune
or
duty
shall
call
me
be
assured
he
will
not
answered
arthur
rené
is
incapable
of
a
base
or
ignoble
thought
and
if
he
could
despise
trifles
as
he
detests
dishonour
he
might
be
ranked
high
in
the
list
of
monarchs
this
resolution
being
adopted
the
son
presented
his
father
at
king
rené
court
whom
he
privately
made
acquainted
that
he
was
a
man
of
quality
and
a
distinguished
lancastrian
the
good
king
would
in
his
heart
have
preferred
a
guest
of
lighter
accomplishments
and
gayer
temper
to
oxford
a
statesman
and
a
soldier
of
melancholy
and
grave
habits
the
earl
was
conscious
of
this
and
seldom
troubled
his
benevolent
and
host
with
his
presence
he
had
however
an
opportunity
of
rendering
the
old
king
a
favour
of
peculiar
value
this
was
in
conducting
an
important
treaty
betwixt
rené
and
louis
xi
of
france
his
nephew
upon
that
crafty
monarch
rené
finally
settled
his
principality
for
the
necessity
of
extricating
his
affairs
by
such
a
measure
was
now
apparent
even
to
himself
every
thought
of
favouring
charles
of
burgundy
in
the
arrangement
having
died
with
queen
margaret
the
policy
and
wisdom
of
the
english
earl
who
was
intrusted
with
almost
the
sole
charge
of
this
secret
and
delicate
measure
were
of
the
utmost
advantage
to
good
king
rené
who
was
freed
from
personal
and
pecuniary
vexations
and
enabled
to
go
piping
and
tabouring
to
his
grave
louis
did
not
fail
to
propitiate
the
plenipotentiary
by
throwing
out
distant
hopes
of
aid
to
the
efforts
of
the
lancastrian
party
in
england
a
faint
and
insecure
negotiation
was
entered
into
upon
the
subject
and
these
affairs
which
rendered
two
journeys
to
paris
necessary
on
the
part
of
oxford
and
his
son
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
the
year
occupied
them
until
that
year
was
half
spent
in
the
meanwhile
the
wars
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
with
the
swiss
cantons
and
count
ferrand
of
lorraine
continued
to
rage
before
midsummer
charles
had
assembled
a
new
army
of
at
least
sixty
thousand
men
supported
by
one
hundred
and
fifty
pieces
of
cannon
for
the
purpose
of
invading
switzerland
where
the
warlike
mountaineers
easily
levied
a
host
of
thirty
thousand
switzers
now
accounted
almost
invincible
and
called
upon
their
confederates
the
free
cities
on
the
rhine
to
support
them
with
a
powerful
body
of
cavalry
the
first
efforts
of
charles
were
successful
he
overran
the
pays
de
vaud
and
recovered
most
of
the
places
which
he
had
lost
after
the
defeat
at
granson
but
instead
of
attempting
to
secure
a
frontier
or
what
would
have
been
still
more
politic
to
achieve
a
peace
upon
equitable
terms
with
his
redoubtable
neighbours
this
most
obstinate
of
princes
resumed
the
purpose
of
penetrating
into
the
recesses
of
the
alpine
mountains
and
chastising
the
mountaineers
even
within
their
own
strongholds
though
experience
might
have
taught
him
the
danger
nay
desperation
of
the
attempt
thus
the
news
received
by
oxford
and
his
son
when
they
returned
to
aix
in
midsummer
was
that
duke
charles
had
advanced
to
morat
or
murten
situated
upon
a
lake
of
the
same
name
at
the
very
entrance
of
switzerland
here
report
said
that
adrian
de
bubenburg
a
veteran
knight
of
berne
commanded
and
maintained
the
most
obstinate
defence
in
expectation
of
the
relief
which
his
countrymen
were
hastily
assembling
alas
my
old
said
the
earl
to
his
son
on
hearing
these
tidings
this
town
besieged
these
assaults
repelled
this
vicinity
of
an
enemy
country
this
profound
lake
these
inaccessible
cliffs
threaten
a
second
part
of
the
tragedy
of
granson
more
calamitous
perhaps
than
even
the
former
on
the
last
week
of
june
the
capital
of
provence
was
agitated
by
one
of
those
unauthorised
yet
generally
received
rumours
which
transmit
great
events
with
incredible
swiftness
as
an
apple
flung
from
hand
to
hand
by
a
number
of
people
will
pass
a
given
space
infinitely
faster
than
if
borne
by
the
most
rapid
series
of
expresses
the
report
announced
a
second
defeat
of
the
burgundians
in
terms
so
exaggerated
as
induced
the
earl
of
oxford
to
consider
the
greater
part
if
not
the
whole
as
a
fabrication
chapter
xvi
and
is
the
hostile
troop
arrived
and
have
they
won
the
day
it
must
have
been
a
bloody
field
ere
darwent
fled
away
ettrick
sleep
did
not
close
the
eyes
of
the
earl
of
oxford
or
his
son
for
although
the
success
or
defeat
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
could
not
now
be
of
importance
to
their
own
private
or
political
affairs
yet
the
father
did
not
cease
to
interest
himself
in
the
fate
of
his
former
and
the
son
with
the
fire
of
youth
always
eager
after
novelty
expected
to
find
something
to
advance
or
thwart
his
own
progress
in
every
remarkable
event
which
agitated
the
world
arthur
had
risen
from
his
bed
and
was
in
the
act
of
attiring
himself
when
the
tread
of
a
horse
arrested
his
attention
he
had
no
sooner
looked
out
of
the
window
than
exclaiming
news
my
father
news
from
the
army
he
rushed
into
the
street
where
a
cavalier
who
appeared
to
have
ridden
very
hard
was
inquiring
for
the
two
philipsons
father
and
son
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
colvin
the
master
of
the
burgundian
ordnance
his
ghastly
look
bespoke
distress
of
mind
his
disordered
array
and
broken
armour
which
seemed
rusted
with
rain
or
stained
with
blood
gave
the
intelligence
of
some
affray
in
which
he
had
probably
been
worsted
and
so
exhausted
was
his
gallant
steed
that
it
was
with
difficulty
the
animal
could
stand
upright
the
condition
of
the
rider
was
not
much
better
when
he
alighted
from
his
horse
to
greet
arthur
he
reeled
so
much
that
he
would
have
fallen
without
instant
support
his
horny
eye
had
lost
the
power
of
speculation
his
limbs
possessed
imperfectly
that
of
motion
and
it
was
with
a
voice
that
he
muttered
only
fatigue
want
of
rest
and
of
food
arthur
assisted
him
into
the
house
and
refreshments
were
procured
but
he
refused
all
except
a
bowl
of
wine
after
tasting
which
he
set
it
down
and
looking
at
the
earl
of
oxford
with
an
eye
of
the
deepest
affliction
he
ejaculated
the
duke
of
burgundy
slain
replied
the
earl
i
trust
not
it
might
have
been
better
if
he
were
said
the
englishman
but
dishonour
has
come
before
death
defeated
then
said
oxford
so
completely
and
fearfully
defeated
answered
the
soldier
that
all
that
i
have
seen
of
loss
before
was
slight
in
comparison
but
how
or
where
said
the
earl
of
oxford
you
were
superior
in
numbers
as
we
were
informed
two
to
one
at
least
answered
colvin
and
when
i
speak
of
our
encounter
at
this
moment
i
could
rend
my
flesh
with
my
teeth
for
being
here
to
tell
such
a
tale
of
shame
we
had
sat
down
for
about
a
week
before
that
paltry
town
of
murten
or
morat
or
whatever
it
is
called
the
governor
one
of
those
stubborn
mountain
bears
of
berne
bade
us
defiance
he
would
not
even
condescend
to
shut
his
gates
but
when
we
summoned
the
town
returned
for
answer
we
might
enter
if
we
pleased
we
should
be
suitably
received
i
would
have
tried
to
bring
him
to
reason
by
a
salvo
or
two
of
artillery
but
the
duke
was
too
much
irritated
to
listen
to
good
counsel
stimulated
by
that
black
traitor
he
deemed
it
better
to
run
forward
with
his
whole
force
upon
a
place
which
though
i
could
soon
have
battered
it
about
their
german
ears
was
yet
too
strong
to
be
carried
by
swords
lances
and
hagbuts
we
were
beaten
off
with
great
loss
and
much
discouragement
to
the
soldiers
we
then
commenced
more
regularly
and
my
batteries
would
have
brought
these
mad
switzers
to
their
senses
walls
and
ramparts
went
down
before
the
lusty
cannoneers
of
burgundy
we
were
well
secured
also
by
intrenchments
against
those
whom
we
heard
of
as
approaching
to
raise
the
siege
but
on
the
evening
of
the
twentieth
of
this
month
we
learned
that
they
were
close
at
hand
and
charles
consulting
only
his
own
bold
spirit
advanced
to
meet
them
relinquishing
the
advantage
of
our
batteries
and
strong
position
by
his
orders
though
against
my
own
judgment
i
accompanied
him
with
twenty
good
pieces
and
the
flower
of
my
people
we
broke
up
on
the
next
morning
and
had
not
advanced
far
before
we
saw
the
lances
and
thick
array
of
halberds
and
swords
which
crested
the
mountain
heaven
too
added
its
terrors
a
thunderstorm
with
all
the
fury
of
those
tempestuous
climates
descended
on
both
armies
but
did
most
annoyance
to
ours
as
our
troops
especially
the
italians
were
more
sensible
to
the
torrents
of
rain
which
poured
down
and
the
rivulets
which
swelled
into
torrents
inundated
and
disordered
our
position
the
duke
for
once
saw
it
necessary
to
alter
his
purpose
of
instant
battle
he
rode
up
to
me
and
directed
me
to
defend
with
the
cannon
the
retreat
which
he
was
about
to
commence
adding
that
he
himself
would
in
person
sustain
me
with
the
the
order
was
given
to
retreat
but
the
movement
gave
new
spirit
to
an
enemy
already
sufficiently
audacious
the
ranks
of
the
swiss
instantly
prostrated
themselves
in
prayer
a
practice
on
the
field
of
battle
which
i
have
ridiculed
but
i
will
do
so
no
more
when
after
five
minutes
they
sprang
again
on
their
feet
and
began
to
advance
rapidly
sounding
their
horns
and
crying
their
with
all
their
usual
ferocity
behold
my
lord
the
clouds
of
heaven
opened
shedding
on
the
confederates
the
blessed
light
of
the
returning
sun
while
our
ranks
were
still
in
the
gloom
of
the
tempest
my
men
were
discouraged
the
host
behind
them
was
retreating
the
sudden
light
thrown
on
the
advancing
switzers
showed
along
the
mountains
a
profusion
of
banners
a
glancing
of
arms
giving
to
the
enemy
the
appearance
of
double
the
numbers
that
had
hitherto
been
visible
to
us
i
exhorted
my
followers
to
stand
fast
but
in
doing
so
i
thought
a
thought
and
spoke
a
word
which
was
a
grievous
sin
fast
my
brave
cannoneers
i
said
will
presently
let
them
hear
louder
thunders
and
show
them
more
fatal
lightnings
than
their
prayers
have
put
down
my
men
shouted
but
it
was
an
impious
thought
a
blasphemous
speech
and
evil
came
after
it
we
levelled
our
guns
on
the
advancing
masses
as
fairly
as
cannon
were
ever
pointed
i
can
vouch
it
for
i
laid
the
grand
duchess
of
burgundy
myself
ah
poor
duchess
what
rude
hands
manage
thee
now
the
volley
was
fired
and
ere
the
smoke
spread
from
the
muzzles
i
could
see
many
a
man
and
many
a
banner
go
down
it
was
natural
to
think
such
a
discharge
should
have
checked
the
attack
and
whilst
the
smoke
hid
the
enemy
from
us
i
made
every
effort
again
to
load
our
cannon
and
anxiously
endeavoured
to
look
through
the
mist
to
discover
the
state
of
our
opponents
but
ere
our
smoke
was
cleared
away
or
the
cannon
again
loaded
they
came
headlong
down
on
us
horse
and
foot
old
men
and
boys
and
varlets
charging
up
to
the
muzzle
of
the
guns
and
over
them
with
total
disregard
to
their
lives
my
brave
fellows
were
cut
down
pierced
through
and
overrun
while
they
were
again
loading
their
pieces
nor
do
i
believe
that
a
single
cannon
was
fired
a
second
time
and
the
duke
said
the
earl
of
oxford
did
he
not
support
you
most
loyally
and
bravely
answered
colvin
with
his
own
bodyguard
of
walloons
and
burgundians
but
a
thousand
italian
mercenaries
went
off
and
never
showed
face
again
the
pass
too
was
cumbered
with
the
artillery
and
in
itself
narrow
bordering
on
mountains
and
cliffs
a
deep
lake
close
beside
in
short
it
was
a
place
totally
unfit
for
horsemen
to
act
in
in
spite
of
the
duke
utmost
exertions
and
those
of
the
gallant
flemings
who
fought
around
him
all
were
borne
back
in
complete
disorder
i
was
on
foot
fighting
as
i
could
without
hopes
of
my
life
or
indeed
thoughts
of
saving
it
when
i
saw
the
guns
taken
and
my
faithful
cannoneers
slain
but
i
saw
duke
charles
hard
pressed
and
took
my
horse
from
my
page
that
held
him
thou
too
art
lost
my
poor
orphan
boy
i
could
only
aid
monseigneur
de
la
croye
and
others
to
extricate
the
duke
our
retreat
became
a
total
rout
and
when
we
reached
our
rearguard
which
we
had
left
strongly
encamped
the
banners
of
the
switzers
were
waving
on
our
batteries
for
a
large
division
had
made
a
circuit
through
mountain
passes
known
only
to
themselves
and
attacked
our
camp
vigorously
seconded
by
that
accursed
adrian
de
bubenburg
who
sallied
from
the
beleaguered
town
so
that
our
intrenchments
were
stormed
on
both
sides
at
i
have
more
to
say
but
having
ridden
day
and
night
to
bring
you
these
evil
tidings
my
tongue
clings
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
i
feel
that
i
can
speak
no
more
the
rest
is
all
flight
and
massacre
disgraceful
to
every
soldier
that
shared
in
it
for
my
part
i
confess
my
contumelious
and
insolence
to
man
as
well
as
blasphemy
to
heaven
if
i
live
it
is
but
to
hide
my
disgraced
head
in
a
cowl
and
expiate
the
numerous
sins
of
a
licentious
life
with
difficulty
the
soldier
was
prevailed
upon
to
take
some
nourishment
and
repose
together
with
an
opiate
which
was
prescribed
by
the
physician
of
king
rené
who
recommended
it
as
necessary
to
preserve
even
the
reason
of
his
patient
exhausted
by
the
events
of
the
battle
and
subsequent
fatigue
the
earl
of
oxford
dismissing
other
assistance
watched
alternately
with
his
son
at
colvin
bedside
notwithstanding
the
draught
that
had
been
administered
his
repose
was
far
from
sound
sudden
starts
the
perspiration
which
started
from
his
brow
the
distortions
of
his
countenance
and
the
manner
in
which
he
clenched
his
fists
and
flung
about
his
limbs
showed
that
in
his
dreams
he
was
again
encountering
the
terrors
of
a
desperate
and
forlorn
combat
this
lasted
for
several
hours
but
about
noon
fatigue
and
medicine
prevailed
over
nervous
excitation
and
the
defeated
commander
fell
into
a
deep
and
untroubled
repose
till
evening
about
sunset
he
awakened
and
after
learning
with
whom
and
where
he
was
he
partook
of
refreshments
and
without
any
apparent
consciousness
of
having
told
them
before
detailed
once
more
all
the
particulars
of
the
battle
of
murten
it
were
little
wide
of
truth
he
said
to
calculate
that
one
half
of
the
duke
army
fell
by
the
sword
or
were
driven
into
the
lake
those
who
escaped
are
great
part
of
them
scattered
never
again
to
unite
such
a
desperate
and
irretrievable
rout
was
never
witnessed
we
fled
like
deer
sheep
or
any
other
timid
animals
which
only
remain
in
company
because
they
are
afraid
to
separate
but
never
think
of
order
or
of
defence
and
the
duke
said
the
earl
of
oxford
we
hurried
him
with
us
said
the
soldier
rather
from
instinct
than
loyalty
as
men
flying
from
a
conflagration
snatch
up
what
they
have
of
value
without
knowing
what
they
are
doing
knight
and
knave
officer
and
soldier
fled
in
the
same
panic
and
each
blast
of
the
horn
of
uri
in
our
rear
added
new
wings
to
our
flight
and
the
duke
repeated
oxford
at
first
he
resisted
our
efforts
and
strove
to
turn
back
on
the
foe
but
when
the
flight
became
general
he
galloped
along
with
us
without
a
word
spoken
or
a
command
issued
at
first
we
thought
his
silence
and
passiveness
so
unusual
in
a
temper
so
fiery
were
fortunate
for
securing
his
personal
safety
but
when
we
rode
the
whole
day
without
being
able
to
obtain
a
word
of
reply
to
all
our
questions
when
he
sternly
refused
refreshments
of
every
kind
though
he
had
tasted
no
food
all
that
disastrous
day
when
every
variation
of
his
moody
and
uncertain
temper
was
sunk
into
silent
and
sullen
despair
we
took
counsel
what
was
to
be
done
and
it
was
by
the
general
voice
that
i
was
despatched
to
entreat
that
you
for
whose
counsels
alone
charles
has
been
known
to
have
had
some
occasional
deference
would
come
instantly
to
his
place
of
retreat
and
exert
all
your
influence
to
awaken
him
from
this
lethargy
which
may
otherwise
terminate
his
existence
and
what
remedy
can
i
interpose
said
oxford
you
know
how
he
neglected
my
advice
when
following
it
might
have
served
my
interest
as
well
as
his
own
you
are
aware
that
my
life
was
not
safe
among
the
miscreants
that
surrounded
the
duke
and
exercised
influence
over
him
most
true
answered
colvin
but
i
also
know
he
is
your
ancient
and
it
would
ill
become
me
to
teach
the
noble
earl
of
oxford
what
the
laws
of
chivalry
require
for
your
safety
every
honest
man
in
the
army
will
give
willing
security
it
is
for
that
i
care
least
said
oxford
indifferently
and
if
indeed
my
presence
can
be
of
service
to
the
duke
if
i
could
believe
that
he
desired
it
he
does
he
does
my
lord
said
the
faithful
soldier
with
tears
in
his
eyes
we
heard
him
name
your
name
as
if
the
words
escaped
him
in
a
painful
dream
i
will
go
to
him
such
being
the
case
said
i
will
go
instantly
where
did
he
purpose
to
establish
his
headquarters
he
had
fixed
nothing
for
himself
on
that
or
other
matters
but
monsieur
de
contay
named
la
rivière
near
salins
in
upper
burgundy
as
the
place
of
his
retreat
thither
then
will
we
my
son
with
all
haste
of
preparation
thou
colvin
hadst
better
remain
here
and
see
some
holy
man
to
be
assoilzied
for
thy
hasty
speech
on
the
of
morat
there
was
offence
in
it
without
doubt
but
it
will
be
ill
atoned
for
by
quitting
a
generous
master
when
he
hath
most
need
of
your
good
service
and
it
is
but
an
act
of
cowardice
to
retreat
into
the
cloister
till
we
have
no
longer
active
duties
to
perform
in
this
world
it
is
true
said
colvin
that
should
i
leave
the
duke
now
perhaps
not
a
man
would
stay
behind
that
could
stell
a
cannon
properly
the
sight
of
your
lordship
can
not
but
operate
favourably
on
my
noble
master
since
it
has
waked
the
old
soldier
in
myself
if
your
lordship
can
delay
your
journey
till
i
will
have
my
spiritual
affairs
settled
and
my
bodily
health
sufficiently
restored
to
be
your
guide
to
la
rivière
and
for
the
cloister
i
will
think
of
it
when
i
have
regained
the
good
name
which
i
have
lost
at
murten
but
i
will
have
masses
said
and
these
right
powerful
for
the
souls
of
my
poor
cannoneers
the
proposal
of
colvin
was
adopted
and
oxford
with
his
son
attended
by
thiebault
spent
the
day
in
preparation
excepting
the
time
necessary
to
take
formal
leave
of
king
rené
who
seemed
to
part
with
them
with
regret
in
company
with
the
ordnance
officer
of
the
discomfited
duke
they
traversed
those
parts
of
provence
dauphiné
and
franche
compté
which
lie
between
aix
and
the
place
to
which
the
duke
of
burgundy
had
retreated
but
the
distance
and
inconvenience
of
so
long
a
route
consumed
more
than
a
fortnight
on
the
road
and
the
month
of
july
was
commenced
when
the
travellers
arrived
in
upper
burgundy
and
at
the
castle
of
la
rivière
about
twenty
miles
to
the
south
of
the
town
of
salins
the
castle
which
was
but
of
small
size
was
surrounded
by
very
many
tents
which
were
pitched
in
a
crowded
disordered
and
unsoldierlike
manner
very
unlike
the
discipline
usually
observed
in
the
camp
of
charles
the
bold
that
the
duke
was
present
there
however
was
attested
by
his
broad
banner
which
rich
with
all
its
quarterings
streamed
from
the
battlements
of
the
castle
the
guard
turned
out
to
receive
the
strangers
but
in
a
manner
so
disorderly
that
the
earl
looked
to
colvin
for
explanation
the
master
of
the
ordnance
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
was
silent
colvin
having
sent
in
notice
of
his
arrival
and
that
of
the
english
earl
monsieur
de
contay
caused
them
presently
to
be
admitted
and
expressed
much
joy
at
their
arrival
a
few
of
us
he
said
true
servants
of
the
duke
are
holding
council
here
at
which
your
assistance
my
noble
lord
of
oxford
will
be
of
the
utmost
importance
messieurs
de
la
croye
de
craon
rubempré
and
others
nobles
of
burgundy
are
now
assembled
to
superintend
the
defence
of
the
country
at
this
exigence
they
all
expressed
delight
to
see
the
earl
of
oxford
and
had
only
abstained
from
thrusting
their
attentions
on
him
the
last
time
he
was
in
the
duke
camp
as
they
understood
it
was
his
wish
to
observe
incognito
his
grace
said
de
craon
has
asked
after
you
twice
and
on
both
times
by
your
assumed
name
of
philipson
i
wonder
not
at
that
my
lord
of
craon
replied
the
english
nobleman
the
origin
of
the
name
took
its
rise
in
former
days
when
i
was
here
during
my
first
exile
it
was
then
said
that
we
poor
lancastrian
nobles
must
assume
other
names
than
our
own
and
the
good
duke
philip
said
as
i
was
to
his
son
charles
i
must
be
called
after
himself
by
the
name
of
philipson
in
memory
of
the
good
sovereign
i
took
that
name
when
the
day
of
need
actually
arrived
and
i
see
that
the
duke
thinks
of
our
early
intimacy
by
his
distinguishing
me
how
fares
his
grace
the
burgundians
looked
at
each
other
and
there
was
a
pause
even
like
a
man
stunned
brave
oxford
at
length
de
contay
replied
sieur
you
can
best
inform
the
noble
earl
of
the
condition
of
our
sovereign
he
is
like
a
man
distracted
said
the
future
historian
of
that
busy
period
after
the
battle
of
granson
he
was
never
to
my
thinking
of
the
same
sound
judgment
as
before
but
then
he
was
capricious
unreasonable
peremptory
and
inconsistent
and
resented
every
counsel
that
was
offered
as
if
it
had
been
meant
in
insult
was
jealous
of
the
least
trespass
in
point
of
ceremonial
as
if
his
subjects
were
holding
him
in
contempt
now
there
is
a
total
change
as
if
this
second
blow
had
stunned
him
and
suppressed
the
violent
passions
which
the
first
called
into
action
he
is
silent
as
a
carthusian
solitary
as
a
hermit
expresses
interest
in
nothing
least
of
all
in
the
guidance
of
his
army
he
was
you
know
anxious
about
his
dress
so
much
so
that
there
was
some
affectation
even
in
the
rudenesses
which
he
practised
in
that
matter
but
woe
me
you
will
see
a
change
now
he
will
not
suffer
his
hair
or
nails
to
be
trimmed
or
arranged
he
is
totally
heedless
of
respect
or
disrespect
towards
him
takes
little
or
no
nourishment
uses
strong
wines
which
however
do
not
seem
to
affect
his
understanding
he
will
hear
nothing
of
war
or
state
affairs
as
little
of
hunting
or
of
sport
suppose
an
anchorite
brought
from
a
cell
to
govern
a
kingdom
you
see
in
him
except
in
point
of
devotion
a
picture
of
the
fiery
active
charles
of
burgundy
you
speak
of
a
mind
deeply
wounded
sieur
replied
the
englishman
think
you
it
fit
i
should
present
myself
before
the
duke
i
will
inquire
said
contay
and
leaving
the
apartment
returned
presently
and
made
a
sign
to
the
earl
to
follow
him
in
a
cabinet
or
closet
the
unfortunate
charles
reclined
in
a
large
his
legs
carelessly
stretched
on
a
footstool
but
so
changed
that
the
earl
of
oxford
could
have
believed
what
he
saw
to
be
the
ghost
of
the
once
fiery
duke
indeed
the
shaggy
length
of
hair
which
streaming
from
his
head
mingled
with
his
beard
the
hollowness
of
the
caverns
at
the
bottom
of
which
rolled
his
wild
eyes
the
falling
in
of
the
breast
and
the
advance
of
the
shoulders
gave
the
ghastly
appearance
of
one
who
has
suffered
the
final
agony
which
takes
from
mortality
the
signs
of
life
and
energy
his
very
costume
a
cloak
flung
loosely
over
him
increased
his
resemblance
to
a
shrouded
phantom
de
contay
named
the
earl
of
oxford
but
the
duke
gazed
on
him
with
a
lustreless
eye
and
gave
him
no
answer
speak
to
him
brave
oxford
said
the
burgundian
in
a
whisper
he
is
even
worse
than
usual
but
perhaps
he
may
know
your
voice
never
when
the
duke
of
burgundy
was
in
the
most
palmy
state
of
his
fortunes
did
the
noble
englishman
kneel
to
kiss
his
hand
with
such
sincere
reverence
he
respected
in
him
not
only
the
afflicted
friend
but
the
humbled
sovereign
upon
whose
tower
of
trust
the
lightning
had
so
recently
broken
it
was
probably
the
falling
of
a
tear
upon
his
hand
which
seemed
to
awake
the
duke
attention
for
he
looked
towards
the
earl
and
said
oxford
philipson
my
old
my
only
friend
hast
thou
found
me
out
in
this
retreat
of
shame
and
misery
i
am
not
your
only
friend
my
lord
said
oxford
heaven
has
given
you
many
affectionate
friends
among
your
natural
and
loyal
subjects
but
though
a
stranger
and
saving
the
allegiance
i
owe
to
my
lawful
sovereign
i
will
yield
to
none
of
them
in
the
respect
and
deference
which
i
have
paid
to
your
grace
in
prosperity
and
now
come
to
render
to
you
in
adversity
adversity
indeed
said
the
duke
irremediable
intolerable
adversity
i
was
lately
charles
of
burgundy
called
the
bold
now
am
i
twice
beaten
by
a
scum
of
german
peasants
my
standard
taken
my
put
to
flight
my
camp
twice
plundered
and
each
time
of
value
more
than
equal
to
the
price
of
all
switzerland
fairly
lost
myself
hunted
like
a
caitiff
goat
or
chamois
the
utmost
spite
of
hell
could
never
accumulate
more
shame
on
the
head
of
a
sovereign
on
the
contrary
my
lord
said
oxford
it
is
a
trial
of
heaven
which
calls
for
patience
and
strength
of
mind
the
bravest
and
best
knight
may
lose
the
saddle
he
is
but
a
laggard
who
lies
rolling
on
the
sand
of
the
lists
after
the
accident
has
chanced
ha
laggard
thou
said
the
duke
some
part
of
his
ancient
spirit
awakened
by
the
broad
taunt
leave
my
presence
sir
and
return
to
it
no
more
till
you
are
summoned
thither
which
i
trust
will
be
no
later
than
your
grace
quits
your
dishabille
and
disposes
yourself
to
see
your
vassals
and
friends
with
such
ceremony
as
befits
you
and
them
said
the
earl
composedly
how
mean
you
by
that
sir
earl
you
are
unmannerly
if
i
be
my
lord
i
am
taught
my
by
circumstances
i
can
mourn
over
fallen
dignity
but
i
can
not
honour
him
who
dishonours
himself
by
bending
like
a
regardless
boy
beneath
the
scourge
of
evil
fortune
and
who
am
i
that
you
should
term
me
such
said
charles
starting
up
in
all
his
natural
pride
and
ferocity
or
who
are
you
but
a
miserable
exile
that
you
should
break
in
upon
my
privacy
with
such
disrespectful
upbraiding
for
me
replied
oxford
i
am
as
you
say
an
unrespected
exile
nor
am
i
ashamed
of
my
condition
since
unshaken
loyalty
to
my
king
and
his
successors
has
brought
me
to
it
but
in
you
can
i
recognise
the
duke
of
burgundy
in
a
sullen
hermit
whose
guards
are
a
disorderly
soldiery
dreadful
only
to
their
friends
whose
councils
are
in
confusion
for
want
of
their
sovereign
and
who
himself
lurks
like
a
lamed
wolf
in
its
den
in
an
obscure
castle
waiting
but
a
blast
of
the
switzer
horn
to
fling
open
its
gates
which
there
are
none
to
defend
who
wears
not
a
knightly
sword
to
protect
his
person
and
can
not
even
die
like
a
stag
at
bay
but
must
be
worried
like
a
hunted
fox
death
and
hell
slanderous
traitor
thundered
the
duke
glancing
a
look
at
his
side
and
perceiving
himself
without
a
it
is
well
for
thee
i
have
no
sword
or
thou
shouldst
never
boast
of
thine
insolence
going
contay
step
forth
like
a
good
knight
and
confute
the
calumniator
say
are
not
my
soldiers
arrayed
disciplined
and
in
order
my
lord
said
contay
trembling
brave
as
he
was
in
battle
at
the
frantic
rage
which
charles
exhibited
there
are
a
numerous
soldiery
yet
under
your
command
but
they
are
in
evil
order
and
in
worse
discipline
i
think
than
they
were
wont
i
see
it
i
see
it
said
the
duke
idle
and
evil
counsellors
are
ye
hearken
sir
of
contay
what
have
you
and
the
rest
of
you
been
doing
holding
as
you
do
large
lands
and
high
fiefs
of
us
that
i
can
not
stretch
my
limbs
on
a
when
my
heart
is
half
broken
but
my
troops
must
fall
into
such
scandalous
disorder
as
exposes
me
to
the
scorn
and
reproach
of
each
beggarly
foreigner
my
lord
replied
contay
more
firmly
we
have
done
what
we
could
but
your
grace
has
accustomed
your
mercenary
generals
and
leaders
of
free
companies
to
take
their
orders
only
from
your
own
mouth
or
hand
they
clamour
also
for
pay
and
the
treasurer
refuses
to
issue
it
without
your
grace
order
as
he
alleges
it
might
cost
him
his
head
and
they
will
not
be
guided
and
restrained
either
by
us
or
those
who
compose
your
council
the
duke
laughed
sternly
but
was
evidently
somewhat
pleased
with
the
reply
ha
ha
he
said
it
is
only
burgundy
who
can
ride
his
own
wild
horses
and
rule
his
own
wild
soldiery
hark
thee
contay
i
ride
forth
to
review
the
troops
for
what
disorder
has
passed
allowance
shall
be
made
pay
also
shall
be
issued
but
woe
to
those
who
shall
have
offended
too
deeply
let
my
grooms
of
the
chamber
know
to
provide
me
fitting
dress
and
arms
i
have
got
a
lesson
glancing
a
dark
look
at
oxford
and
i
will
not
again
be
insulted
without
the
means
of
wreaking
my
vengeance
begone
both
of
you
and
contay
send
the
treasurer
hither
with
his
accounts
and
woe
to
his
soul
if
i
find
aught
to
complain
of
begone
i
say
and
send
him
hither
they
left
the
apartment
with
suitable
obeisance
as
they
retired
the
duke
said
abruptly
lord
of
oxford
a
word
with
you
where
did
you
study
medicine
in
your
own
famed
university
i
suppose
thy
physic
hath
wrought
a
wonder
yet
doctor
philipson
it
might
have
cost
thee
thy
life
i
have
ever
thought
my
life
cheap
said
oxford
when
the
object
was
to
help
my
friend
thou
art
indeed
a
friend
said
charles
and
a
fearless
one
but
go
i
have
been
sore
troubled
and
thou
hast
tasked
my
temper
closely
we
will
speak
further
meantime
i
forgive
thee
and
i
honour
thee
the
earl
of
oxford
retired
to
the
where
the
burgundian
nobility
aware
of
what
had
passed
crowded
around
him
with
thanks
compliments
and
congratulations
a
general
bustle
now
ensued
orders
were
hurried
off
in
every
direction
those
officers
who
had
duties
to
perform
which
had
been
neglected
hastened
to
conceal
or
to
atone
for
their
negligence
there
was
a
general
tumult
in
the
camp
but
it
was
a
tumult
of
joy
for
soldiers
are
always
most
pleased
when
they
are
best
in
order
for
performing
their
military
service
and
licence
or
inactivity
however
acceptable
at
times
are
not
when
continued
so
agreeable
to
their
nature
as
strict
discipline
and
a
prospect
of
employment
the
treasurer
who
was
luckily
for
him
a
man
of
sense
and
method
having
been
two
hours
in
private
with
the
duke
returned
with
looks
of
wonder
and
professed
that
never
in
charles
most
prosperous
days
had
he
showed
himself
more
acute
in
the
department
of
finance
of
which
he
had
but
that
morning
seemed
totally
incapable
and
the
merit
was
universally
attributed
to
the
visit
of
lord
oxford
whose
timely
reprimand
had
like
the
shot
of
a
cannon
dispersing
foul
mists
awakened
the
duke
from
his
black
and
bilious
melancholy
on
the
following
day
charles
reviewed
his
troops
with
his
usual
attention
directed
new
levies
made
various
dispositions
of
his
forces
and
corrected
the
faults
of
their
discipline
by
severe
orders
which
were
enforced
by
some
deserved
punishments
of
which
the
italian
mercenaries
of
had
a
large
share
and
rendered
palatable
by
the
payment
of
arrears
which
was
calculated
to
attach
them
to
the
standard
under
which
they
served
the
duke
also
after
consulting
with
his
council
agreed
to
convoke
meetings
of
the
states
in
his
different
territories
redress
certain
popular
grievances
and
grant
some
boons
which
he
had
hitherto
denied
and
thus
began
to
open
a
new
account
of
popularity
with
his
subjects
in
place
of
that
which
his
rashness
had
exhausted
footnotes

or

however

while
he
serves

from
this
time
all
was
activity
in
the
duke
of
burgundy
court
and
army
money
was
collected
soldiers
were
levied
and
certain
news
of
the
confederates
motions
only
were
wanting
to
bring
on
the
campaign
but
although
charles
was
to
all
outward
appearance
as
active
as
ever
yet
those
who
were
more
immediately
about
his
person
were
of
opinion
that
he
did
not
display
the
soundness
of
mind
or
the
energy
of
judgment
which
had
been
admired
in
him
before
these
calamities
he
was
still
liable
to
fits
of
moody
melancholy
similar
to
those
which
descended
upon
saul
and
was
vehemently
furious
when
aroused
out
of
them
indeed
the
earl
of
oxford
himself
seemed
to
have
lost
the
power
which
he
had
exercised
over
him
at
first
nay
though
in
general
charles
was
both
grateful
and
affectionate
towards
him
he
evidently
felt
humbled
by
the
recollection
of
his
having
witnessed
his
impotent
and
disastrous
condition
and
was
so
much
afraid
of
lord
oxford
being
supposed
to
lead
his
counsels
that
he
often
repelled
his
advice
merely
as
it
seemed
to
show
his
own
independence
of
mind
in
these
froward
humours
the
duke
was
much
encouraged
by
that
wily
traitor
now
saw
his
master
affairs
tottering
to
their
fall
and
he
resolved
to
lend
his
lever
to
the
work
so
as
to
entitle
him
to
a
share
of
the
spoil
he
regarded
oxford
as
one
of
the
most
able
friends
and
counsellors
who
adhered
to
the
duke
he
thought
he
saw
in
his
looks
that
he
fathomed
his
own
treacherous
purpose
and
therefore
he
hated
and
feared
him
besides
in
order
perhaps
to
colour
over
even
to
his
own
eyes
the
abominable
perfidy
he
meditated
he
affected
to
be
exceedingly
enraged
against
the
duke
for
the
late
punishment
of
marauders
belonging
to
his
italian
bands
he
believed
that
chastisement
to
have
been
inflicted
by
the
advice
of
oxford
and
he
suspected
that
the
measure
was
pressed
with
the
hope
of
discovering
that
the
italians
had
not
pillaged
for
their
own
emolument
only
but
for
that
of
their
commander
believing
that
oxford
was
thus
hostile
to
him
would
have
speedily
found
means
to
take
him
out
of
his
path
had
not
the
earl
himself
found
it
prudent
to
observe
some
precautions
and
the
lords
of
flanders
and
burgundy
who
loved
him
for
the
very
reasons
for
which
the
italian
abhorred
him
watched
over
his
safety
with
a
vigilance
of
which
he
himself
was
ignorant
but
which
certainly
was
the
means
of
preserving
his
life
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
ferrand
of
lorraine
should
have
left
his
victory
so
long
unimproved
but
the
swiss
confederates
who
were
the
strength
of
his
forces
insisted
that
the
first
operations
should
take
place
in
savoy
and
the
pays
de
vaud
where
the
burgundians
had
many
garrisons
which
though
they
received
no
relief
yet
were
not
easily
or
speedily
reduced
besides
the
switzers
being
like
most
of
the
national
soldiers
of
the
time
a
kind
of
militia
most
of
them
returned
home
to
get
in
their
harvest
and
to
deposit
their
spoil
in
safety
ferrand
therefore
though
bent
on
pursuing
his
success
with
all
the
ardour
of
youthful
chivalry
was
prevented
from
making
any
movement
in
advance
until
the
month
of
december
in
the
meantime
the
duke
of
burgundy
forces
to
be
least
burdensome
to
the
country
were
cantoned
in
distant
places
of
his
dominions
where
every
exertion
was
made
to
perfect
the
discipline
of
the
new
levies
the
duke
if
left
to
himself
would
have
precipitated
the
struggle
by
again
assembling
his
forces
and
pushing
forward
into
the
helvetian
territories
but
though
he
inwardly
foamed
at
the
recollection
of
granson
and
murten
the
memory
of
these
disasters
was
too
recent
to
permit
such
a
plan
of
the
campaign
meantime
weeks
glided
past
and
the
month
of
december
was
far
advanced
when
one
morning
as
the
duke
was
sitting
in
council
suddenly
entered
with
a
degree
of
extravagant
rapture
in
his
countenance
singularly
different
from
the
cold
regulated
and
subtle
smile
which
was
usually
his
utmost
advance
towards
laughter
he
said
for
sake
if
it
please
your
grace
and
what
of
good
fortune
comes
nigh
us
said
the
duke
methought
she
had
forgot
the
way
to
our
gates
she
has
returned
to
them
please
your
highness
with
her
cornucopia
full
of
choicest
gifts
ready
to
pour
her
fruit
her
flowers
her
treasures
on
the
head
of
the
sovereign
of
europe
most
worthy
to
receive
them
the
meaning
of
all
this
said

charles
riddles
are
for
children
the
harebrained
young
madman
ferrand
who
calls
himself
of
lorraine
has
broken
down
from
the
mountains
at
the
head
of
a
desultory

of
scapegraces
like
himself
and

said
contay
astonished
at
the
gay
humour
with
which
the
italian
treated
a
matter
so
serious
i
have
seldom
heard
a
fool
laugh
more
gaily
at
a
more
scurvy
jest
than
you
a
wise
man
laugh
at
the
loss
of
the
principal
town
of
the
province
we
are
fighting
for
i
laugh
said
among
the
spears
as
my
does
ha
ha
among
the
trumpets
i
laugh
also
over
the
destruction
of
the
enemy
and
the
dividing
of
the
spoil
as
eagles
scream
their
joy
over
the
division
of

i
laugh
you

said
the
lord
of
contay
waxing
impatient
when
you
have
all
the
mirth
to
yourself
as
you
laughed
after
our
losses
at
granson
and

sir
said
the

viewed

from
the
protection
of
his
mountains
and

deal
with
me
as
i
keep
my
oath
when
i
swear
that
the
next
fair
field
on
which
we
meet
shall
see
one
of
us
dead
it
is
now
the
last
week
of
the
old
year
and
before
we
will
see
whether
he
or
i
shall
find
the
bean

the
to
arms
my
lords
let
our
camp
instantly
break
up
and
our
troops
move
forward
towards
lorraine
send
off
the
italian
and
albanian
light
cavalry
and
the
stradiots
to
scour
the
country
in
the
van
oxford
thou
wilt
bear
arms
in
this
journey
wilt
thou
not
surely
said
the
earl
i
am
eating
your
highness
bread
and
when
enemies
invade
it
stands
with
my
honour
to
fight
for
your
grace
as
if
i
was
your
born
subject
with
your
grace
permission
i
will
despatch
a
pursuivant
who
shall
carry
letters
to
my
late
kind
host
the
landamman
of
unterwalden
acquainting
him
with
my
purpose
the
duke
having
given
a
ready
assent
the
pursuivant
was
dismissed
accordingly
and
returned
in
a
few
hours
so
near
had
the
armies
approached
to
each
other
he
bore
a
letter
from
the
landamman
in
a
tone
of
courtesy
and
even
kindness
regretting
that
any
cause
should
have
occurred
for
bearing
arms
against
his
late
guest
for
whom
he
expressed
high
personal
regard
the
same
pursuivant
also
brought
greetings
from
the
family
of
the
biedermans
to
their
friend
arthur
and
a
separate
letter
addressed
to
the
same
person
of
which
the
contents
ran
thus
rudolph
donnerhugel
is
desirous
to
give
the
young
merchant
arthur
philipson
the
opportunity
of
finishing
the
bargain
which
remained
unsettled
between
them
in
the
of
geierstein
he
is
the
more
desirous
of
this
as
he
is
aware
that
the
said
arthur
has
done
him
wrong
in
seducing
the
affections
of
a
certain
maiden
of
rank
to
whom
he
philipson
is
not
and
can
not
be
anything
beyond
an
ordinary
acquaintance
rudolph
donnerhugel
will
send
arthur
philipson
word
when
a
fair
and
equal
meeting
can
take
place
on
neutral
ground
in
the
meantime
he
will
be
as
often
as
possible
in
the
first
rank
of
the
skirmishers
young
arthur
heart
leapt
high
as
he
read
the
defiance
the
piqued
tone
of
which
showed
the
state
of
the
writer
feelings
and
argued
sufficiently
rudolph
disappointment
on
the
subject
of
anne
of
geierstein
and
his
suspicion
that
she
had
bestowed
her
affections
on
the
youthful
stranger
arthur
found
means
of
despatching
a
reply
to
the
challenge
of
the
swiss
assuring
him
of
the
pleasure
with
which
he
would
attend
his
commands
either
in
front
of
the
line
or
elsewhere
as
rudolph
might
desire
meantime
the
armies
were
closely
approaching
to
each
other
and
the
light
troops
sometimes
met
the
stradiots
from
the
venetian
territory
a
sort
of
cavalry
resembling
that
of
the
turks
performed
much
of
that
service
on
the
part
of
the
burgundian
army
for
which
indeed
if
their
fidelity
could
have
been
relied
on
they
were
admirably
well
qualified
the
earl
of
oxford
observed
that
these
men
who
were
under
the
command
of
always
brought
in
intelligence
that
the
enemy
were
in
indifferent
order
and
in
full
retreat
besides
information
was
communicated
through
their
means
that
sundry
individuals
against
whom
the
duke
of
burgundy
entertained
peculiar
personal
dislike
and
whom
he
specially
desired
to
get
into
his
hands
had
taken
refuge
in
nancy
this
greatly
increased
the
ardour
for
retaking
that
place
which
became
perfectly
ungovernable
when
he
learned
that
ferrand
and
his
swiss
allies
had
drawn
off
to
a
neighbouring
position
called
nicholas
on
the
news
of
his
arrival
the
greater
part
of
the
burgundian
counsellors
together
with
the
earl
of
oxford
protested
against
his
besieging
a
place
of
some
strength
while
an
active
enemy
lay
in
the
neighbourhood
to
relieve
it
they
remonstrated
on
the
smallness
of
his
army
on
the
severity
of
the
weather
on
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
provisions
and
exhorted
the
duke
that
having
made
such
a
movement
as
had
forced
the
enemy
to
retreat
he
ought
to
suspend
decisive
operations
till
spring
charles
at
first
tried
to
dispute
and
repel
these
arguments
but
when
his
counsellors
reminded
him
that
he
was
placing
himself
and
his
army
in
the
same
situation
as
at
granson
and
murten
he
became
furious
at
the
recollection
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
only
answered
by
oaths
and
imprecations
that
he
would
be
master
of
nancy
before
twelfth
day
accordingly
the
army
of
burgundy
sat
down
before
nancy
in
a
strong
position
protected
by
the
hollow
of
a
watercourse
and
covered
with
thirty
pieces
of
cannon
which
colvin
had
under
his
charge
having
indulged
his
obstinate
temper
in
thus
arranging
the
campaign
the
duke
seemed
to
give
a
little
more
heed
to
the
advice
of
his
counsellors
touching
the
safety
of
his
person
and
permitted
the
earl
of
oxford
with
his
son
and
two
or
three
officers
of
his
household
men
of
approved
trust
to
sleep
within
his
pavilion
in
addition
to
the
usual
guard
it
wanted
three
days
of
christmas
when
the
duke
sat
down
before
nancy
and
on
that
very
evening
a
tumult
happened
which
seemed
to
justify
the
alarm
for
his
personal
safety
it
was
midnight
and
all
in
the
ducal
pavilion
were
at
rest
when
a
cry
of
treason
arose
the
earl
of
oxford
drawing
his
sword
and
snatching
up
a
light
which
burned
beside
him
rushed
into
the
duke
apartment
and
found
him
standing
on
the
floor
totally
undressed
but
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
striking
around
him
so
furiously
that
the
earl
himself
had
difficulty
in
avoiding
his
blows
the
rest
of
his
officers
rushed
in
their
weapons
drawn
and
their
cloaks
wrapped
around
their
left
arms
when
the
duke
was
somewhat
composed
and
found
himself
surrounded
by
his
friends
he
informed
them
with
rage
and
agitation
that
the
officers
of
the
secret
tribunal
had
in
spite
of
the
vigilant
precautions
taken
found
means
to
gain
entrance
into
his
chamber
and
charged
him
under
the
highest
penalty
to
appear
before
the
holy
vehme
upon
christmas
night
the
bystanders
heard
this
story
with
astonishment
and
some
of
them
were
uncertain
whether
they
ought
to
consider
it
as
a
reality
or
a
dream
of
the
duke
irritable
fancy
but
the
citation
was
found
on
the
duke
toilette
written
as
was
the
form
upon
parchment
signeted
with
three
crosses
and
stuck
to
the
table
with
a
knife
a
slip
of
wood
had
been
also
cut
from
the
table
oxford
read
the
summons
with
attention
it
named
as
usual
a
place
where
the
duke
was
cited
to
come
unarmed
and
unattended
and
from
which
it
was
said
he
would
be
guided
to
the
seat
of
judgment
charles
after
looking
at
the
scroll
for
some
time
gave
vent
to
his
thoughts
i
know
from
what
quiver
this
arrow
comes
he
said
it
is
shot
by
that
degenerate
noble
apostate
priest
and
accomplice
of
sorcerers
albert
of
geierstein
we
have
heard
that
he
is
among
the
motley
group
of
murderers
and
outlaws
whom
the
old
fiddler
of
provence
grandson
has
raked
together
but
by
george
of
burgundy
neither
cowl
soldier
casque
nor
conjurer
cap
shall
save
him
after
such
an
insult
as
this
i
will
degrade
him
from
knighthood
hang
him
from
the
highest
steeple
in
nancy
and
his
daughter
shall
choose
between
the
meanest
in
my
army
and
the
convent
of
whatever
are
your
purposes
my
lord
said
contay
it
were
surely
best
be
silent
when
from
this
late
apparition
we
may
conjecture
that
more
than
we
wot
of
may
be
within
hearing
the
duke
seemed
struck
with
this
hint
and
was
silent
or
at
least
only
muttered
oaths
and
threats
betwixt
his
teeth
while
the
strictest
search
was
made
for
the
intruder
on
his
repose
but
it
was
in
vain
charles
continued
his
researches
incensed
at
a
flight
of
audacity
higher
than
ever
had
been
ventured
upon
by
these
secret
societies
who
whatever
might
be
the
dread
inspired
by
them
had
not
as
yet
attempted
to
cope
with
sovereigns
a
trusty
party
of
burgundians
were
sent
on
christmas
night
to
watch
the
spot
a
meeting
of
four
cross
roads
named
in
the
summons
and
make
prisoners
of
any
whom
they
could
lay
hands
upon
but
no
suspicious
persons
appeared
at
or
near
the
place
the
duke
not
the
less
continued
to
impute
the
affront
he
had
received
to
albert
of
geierstein
there
was
a
price
set
upon
his
head
and
always
willing
to
please
his
master
mood
undertook
that
some
of
his
italians
sufficiently
experienced
in
such
feats
should
bring
the
obnoxious
baron
before
him
alive
or
dead
colvin
contay
and
others
laughed
in
secret
at
the
italian
promises
subtle
as
he
is
said
colvin
he
will
lure
the
wild
vulture
from
the
heavens
before
he
gets
albert
of
geierstein
into
his
power
arthur
to
whom
the
words
of
the
duke
had
given
subject
for
no
small
anxiety
on
account
of
anne
of
geierstein
and
of
her
father
for
her
sake
breathed
more
lightly
on
hearing
his
menaces
held
so
cheaply
it
was
the
second
day
after
this
alarm
that
oxford
felt
a
desire
to
reconnoitre
the
camp
of
ferrand
of
lorraine
having
some
doubts
whether
the
strength
and
position
of
it
were
accurately
reported
he
obtained
the
duke
consent
for
this
purpose
who
at
the
same
time
made
him
and
his
son
a
present
of
two
noble
steeds
of
great
power
and
speed
which
he
himself
highly
valued
so
soon
as
the
duke
pleasure
was
communicated
to
the
italian
count
he
expressed
the
utmost
joy
that
he
was
to
have
the
assistance
of
oxford
age
and
experience
upon
an
exploratory
party
and
selected
a
chosen
band
of
an
hundred
stradiots
whom
he
said
he
had
sent
sometimes
to
skirmish
up
to
the
very
beards
of
the
switzers
the
earl
showed
himself
much
satisfied
with
the
active
and
intelligent
manner
in
which
these
men
performed
their
duty
and
drove
before
them
and
dispersed
some
parties
of
ferrand
cavalry
at
the
entrance
of
a
little
ascending
valley
communicated
to
the
english
noblemen
that
if
they
could
advance
to
the
farther
extremity
they
would
have
a
full
view
of
the
enemy
position
two
or
three
stradiots
then
spurred
on
to
examine
this
defile
and
returning
back
communicated
with
their
leader
in
their
own
language
who
pronouncing
the
passage
safe
invited
the
earl
of
oxford
to
accompany
him
they
proceeded
through
the
valley
without
seeing
an
enemy
but
on
issuing
upon
a
plain
at
the
point
intimated
by
arthur
who
was
in
the
van
of
the
stradiots
and
separated
from
his
father
did
indeed
see
the
camp
of
duke
ferrand
within
half
a
mile
distance
but
a
body
of
cavalry
had
that
instant
issued
from
it
and
were
riding
hastily
towards
the
gorge
of
the
valley
from
which
he
had
just
emerged
he
was
about
to
wheel
his
horse
and
ride
off
but
conscious
of
the
great
speed
of
the
animal
he
thought
he
might
venture
to
stay
for
a
moment
more
accurate
survey
of
the
camp
the
stradiots
who
attended
him
did
not
wait
his
orders
to
retire
but
went
off
as
was
indeed
their
duty
when
attacked
by
a
superior
force
meantime
arthur
observed
that
the
knight
who
seemed
leader
of
the
advancing
squadron
mounted
on
a
powerful
horse
that
shook
the
earth
beneath
him
bore
on
his
shield
the
bear
of
berne
and
had
otherwise
the
appearance
of
the
massive
frame
of
rudolph
donnerhugel
he
was
satisfied
of
this
when
he
beheld
the
cavalier
halt
his
party
and
advance
towards
him
alone
putting
his
lance
in
rest
and
moving
slowly
as
if
to
give
him
time
for
preparation
to
accept
such
a
challenge
in
such
a
moment
was
dangerous
but
to
refuse
it
was
disgraceful
and
while
arthur
blood
boiled
at
the
idea
of
chastising
an
insolent
rival
he
was
not
a
little
pleased
at
heart
that
their
meeting
on
horseback
gave
him
an
advantage
over
the
swiss
through
his
perfect
acquaintance
with
the
practice
of
the
tourney
in
which
rudolph
might
be
supposed
more
ignorant
they
met
as
was
the
phrase
of
the
time
manful
under
shield
the
lance
of
the
swiss
glanced
from
the
helmet
of
the
englishman
against
which
it
was
addressed
while
the
spear
of
arthur
directed
right
against
the
centre
of
his
adversary
body
was
so
justly
aimed
and
so
truly
seconded
by
the
full
fury
of
the
career
as
to
pierce
not
only
the
shield
which
hung
round
the
warrior
neck
but
a
and
a
shirt
of
mail
which
he
wore
beneath
it
passing
clear
through
the
body
the
steel
point
of
the
weapon
was
only
stopped
by
the
of
the
unfortunate
cavalier
who
fell
headlong
from
his
horse
as
if
struck
by
lightning
rolled
twice
or
thrice
over
on
the
ground
tore
the
earth
with
his
hands
and
then
lay
prostrate
a
dead
corpse
there
was
a
cry
of
rage
and
grief
among
those
whose
ranks
rudolph
had
that
instant
left
and
many
couched
their
lances
to
avenge
him
but
ferrand
of
lorraine
who
was
present
in
person
ordered
them
to
make
prisoner
but
not
to
harm
the
successful
champion
this
was
accomplished
for
arthur
had
not
time
to
turn
his
bridle
for
flight
and
resistance
would
have
been
madness
when
brought
before
ferrand
he
raised
his
visor
and
said
is
it
well
my
lord
to
make
captive
an
adventurous
knight
for
doing
his
devoir
against
a
personal
challenger
do
not
complain
sir
arthur
of
oxford
said
ferrand
before
you
experience
injury
you
are
free
sir
knight
your
father
and
you
were
faithful
to
my
royal
aunt
margaret
and
although
she
was
my
enemy
i
do
justice
to
your
fidelity
in
her
behalf
and
from
respect
to
her
memory
disinherited
as
she
was
like
myself
and
to
please
my
grandfather
who
i
think
had
some
regard
for
you
i
give
you
your
freedom
but
i
must
also
care
for
your
safety
during
your
return
to
the
camp
of
burgundy
on
this
side
of
the
hill
we
are
loyal
and
men
on
the
other
they
are
traitors
and
murderers
you
sir
count
will
i
think
gladly
see
our
captive
placed
in
safety
the
knight
to
whom
ferrand
addressed
himself
a
tall
stately
man
put
himself
in
motion
to
attend
on
arthur
while
the
former
was
expressing
to
the
young
duke
of
lorraine
the
sense
he
entertained
of
his
chivalrous
conduct
farewell
sir
arthur
de
vere
said
ferrand
you
have
slain
a
noble
champion
and
to
me
a
most
useful
and
faithful
friend
but
it
was
done
nobly
and
openly
with
equal
arms
and
in
the
front
of
the
line
and
evil
befall
him
who
entertains
feud
first
arthur
bowed
to
his
ferrand
returned
the
salutation
and
they
parted
arthur
and
his
new
companion
had
ridden
but
a
little
way
up
the
ascent
when
the
stranger
spoke
thus
we
have
been
before
young
man
yet
you
remember
me
not
arthur
turned
his
eyes
on
the
cavalier
and
observing
that
the
crest
which
adorned
his
helmet
was
fashioned
like
a
vulture
strange
suspicions
began
to
cross
his
mind
which
were
confirmed
when
the
knight
opening
his
helmet
showed
him
the
dark
and
severe
features
of
the
priest
of
paul
count
albert
of
geierstein
said
arthur
the
same
replied
the
count
though
thou
hast
seen
him
in
other
garb
and
headgear
but
tyranny
drives
all
men
to
arms
and
i
have
resumed
by
the
licence
and
command
of
my
superiors
those
which
i
had
laid
aside
a
war
against
cruelty
and
oppression
is
holy
as
that
waged
in
palestine
in
which
priests
bear
armour
my
lord
count
said
arthur
eagerly
i
can
not
too
soon
entreat
you
to
withdraw
to
sir
ferrand
of
lorraine
squadron
here
you
are
in
peril
where
no
strength
or
courage
can
avail
you
the
duke
has
placed
a
price
on
your
head
and
the
country
betwixt
this
and
nancy
swarms
with
stradiots
and
italian
light
horsemen
i
laugh
at
them
answered
the
count
i
have
not
lived
so
long
in
a
stormy
world
amid
intrigues
of
war
and
policy
to
fall
by
the
mean
hand
of
such
as
they
besides
thou
art
with
me
and
i
have
seen
but
now
that
thou
canst
bear
thee
nobly
in
your
defence
my
lord
said
arthur
who
thought
of
his
companion
as
the
father
of
anne
of
geierstein
i
should
try
to
do
my
best
what
youth
replied
count
albert
with
a
stern
sneer
that
was
peculiar
to
his
countenance
wouldst
thou
aid
the
enemy
of
the
lord
under
whose
banner
thou
servest
against
his
waged
soldiers
arthur
was
somewhat
abashed
at
the
turn
given
to
his
ready
offer
of
assistance
for
which
he
had
expected
at
least
thanks
but
he
instantly
collected
himself
and
replied
my
lord
count
albert
you
have
been
pleased
to
put
yourself
in
peril
to
protect
me
from
partisans
of
your
party
i
am
equally
bound
to
defend
you
from
those
of
our
side
it
is
happily
answered
said
the
count
yet
i
think
there
is
a
little
blind
partisan
of
whom
troubadours
and
minstrels
talk
to
whose
instigation
i
might
in
case
of
need
owe
the
great
zeal
of
my
protector
he
did
not
allow
arthur
who
was
a
good
deal
embarrassed
time
to
reply
but
proceeded
hear
me
young
man
thy
lance
has
this
day
done
an
evil
deed
to
switzerland
to
berne
and
duke
ferrand
in
slaying
their
bravest
champion
but
to
me
the
death
of
rudolph
donnerhugel
is
a
welcome
event
know
that
he
was
as
his
services
grew
more
indispensable
become
importunate
in
requiring
duke
ferrand
interest
with
me
for
my
daughter
hand
and
the
duke
himself
the
son
of
a
princess
blushed
not
to
ask
me
to
bestow
the
last
of
my
house
for
my
brother
family
are
degenerate
mongrels
upon
a
presumptuous
young
man
whose
uncle
was
a
domestic
in
the
house
of
my
wife
father
though
they
boasted
some
relationship
i
believe
through
an
illegitimate
channel
which
yonder
rudolph
was
wont
to
make
the
most
of
as
it
favoured
his
suit
surely
said
arthur
a
match
with
one
so
unequal
in
birth
and
far
more
in
every
other
respect
was
too
monstrous
to
be
mentioned
while
i
lived
replied
count
albert
never
should
such
union
have
been
formed
if
the
death
both
of
bride
and
bridegroom
by
my
dagger
could
have
saved
the
honour
of
my
house
from
violation
but
when
i
i
whose
days
whose
very
hours
are
numbered
shall
be
no
more
what
could
prevent
an
undaunted
suitor
fortified
by
duke
ferrand
favour
by
the
general
applause
of
his
country
and
perhaps
by
the
unfortunate
prepossession
of
my
brother
arnold
from
carrying
his
point
against
the
resistance
and
scruples
of
a
solitary
maiden
rudolph
is
dead
replied
arthur
and
may
heaven
assoilzie
him
from
guilt
but
were
he
alive
and
urging
his
suit
on
anne
of
geierstein
he
would
find
there
was
a
combat
to
be
fought
which
has
been
already
decided
answered
count
albert
now
mark
me
arthur
de
vere
my
daughter
has
told
me
of
the
passages
betwixt
you
and
her
your
sentiments
and
conduct
are
worthy
of
the
noble
house
you
descend
from
which
i
well
know
ranks
with
the
most
illustrious
in
europe
you
are
indeed
disinherited
but
so
is
anne
of
geierstein
save
such
pittance
as
her
uncle
may
impart
to
her
of
her
paternal
inheritance
if
you
share
it
together
till
better
days
always
supposing
your
noble
father
gives
his
consent
for
my
child
shall
enter
no
house
against
the
will
of
its
head
my
daughter
knows
that
she
has
my
willing
consent
and
my
blessing
my
brother
shall
also
know
my
pleasure
he
will
approve
my
purpose
for
though
dead
to
thoughts
of
honour
and
chivalry
he
is
alive
to
social
feelings
loves
his
niece
and
has
friendship
for
thee
and
for
thy
father
what
thou
young
man
to
taking
a
beggarly
countess
to
aid
thee
in
the
journey
of
life
i
believe
nay
i
prophesy
for
i
stand
so
much
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
that
methinks
i
command
a
view
beyond
it
that
a
lustre
will
one
day
after
i
have
long
ended
my
doubtful
and
stormy
life
beam
on
the
coronets
of
de
vere
and
geierstein
de
vere
threw
himself
from
his
horse
clasped
the
hand
of
count
albert
and
was
about
to
exhaust
himself
in
thanks
but
the
count
insisted
on
his
silence
we
are
about
to
part
he
said
the
time
is
short
the
place
is
dangerous
you
are
to
me
personally
speaking
less
than
nothing
had
any
one
of
the
many
schemes
of
ambition
which
i
have
pursued
led
me
to
success
the
son
of
a
banished
earl
had
not
been
the
i
had
chosen
rise
and
remount
your
horse
thanks
are
unpleasing
when
they
are
not
merited
arthur
arose
and
mounting
his
horse
threw
his
raptures
into
a
more
acceptable
form
endeavouring
to
describe
how
his
love
for
anne
and
efforts
for
her
happiness
should
express
his
gratitude
to
her
father
and
observing
that
the
count
listened
with
some
pleasure
to
the
picture
he
drew
of
their
future
life
he
could
not
help
exclaiming
and
you
my
lord
you
who
have
been
the
author
of
all
this
happiness
will
you
not
be
the
witness
and
partaker
of
it
believe
me
we
will
strive
to
soften
the
effect
of
the
hard
blows
which
fortune
has
dealt
to
you
and
should
a
ray
of
better
luck
shine
upon
us
it
will
be
the
more
welcome
that
you
can
share
it
forbear
such
folly
said
the
count
albert
of
geierstein
i
know
my
last
scene
is
approaching
hear
and
tremble
the
duke
of
burgundy
is
sentenced
to
die
and
the
secret
and
invisible
judges
who
doom
in
secret
and
avenge
in
secret
like
the
deity
have
given
the
cord
and
the
dagger
to
my
hand
oh
cast
from
you
these
vile
symbols
exclaimed
arthur
with
enthusiasm
let
them
find
butchers
and
common
stabbers
to
do
such
an
office
and
not
dishonour
the
noble
lord
of
geierstein
peace
foolish
boy
answered
the
count
the
oath
by
which
i
am
sworn
is
higher
than
that
clouded
sky
more
deeply
fixed
than
those
distant
mountains
nor
think
my
act
is
that
of
an
assassin
though
for
such
i
might
plead
the
duke
own
example
i
send
not
hirelings
like
these
base
stradiots
to
hunt
his
life
without
imperilling
mine
own
i
give
not
his
daughter
innocent
of
his
offences
the
choice
betwixt
a
disgraceful
marriage
and
a
discreditable
retreat
from
the
world
no
arthur
de
vere
i
seek
charles
with
the
resolved
mind
of
one
who
to
take
the
life
of
an
adversary
exposes
himself
to
certain
death
i
pray
you
speak
no
further
of
it
said
arthur
very
anxiously
consider
i
serve
for
the
present
the
prince
whom
you
threaten
and
art
bound
interrupted
the
count
to
unfold
to
him
what
i
tell
you
i
desire
you
should
do
so
and
though
he
hath
already
neglected
a
summons
of
the
tribunal
i
am
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
of
sending
him
personal
defiance
say
to
charles
of
burgundy
that
he
has
wronged
albert
of
geierstein
he
who
is
injured
in
his
honour
loses
all
value
for
his
life
and
whoever
does
so
has
full
command
over
that
of
another
man
bid
him
keep
himself
well
from
me
since
if
he
see
a
second
sun
of
the
approaching
year
rise
over
the
distant
alps
albert
of
geierstein
is
and
now
begone
for
i
see
a
party
approach
under
a
burgundian
banner
they
will
insure
your
safety
but
should
i
remain
longer
would
endanger
mine
so
saying
the
count
of
geierstein
turned
his
horse
and
rode
off
footnotes
used
by
the
spanish
as
the
french
say
étrennes
or
the
english
handsell
or
luckpenny
phrases
used
by
inferiors
to
their
patrons
as
the
bringers

chapter
xviii
faint
the
din
of
battle
distant
down
the
heavy
wind
war
and
terror
fled
before
wounds
and
death
were
left
behind
mickle
arthur
left
alone
and
desirous
perhaps
to
cover
the
retreat
of
count
albert
rode
towards
the
approaching
body
of
burgundian
cavalry
who
were
arrayed
under
the
lord
contay
banner
welcome
welcome
said
that
nobleman
advancing
hastily
to
the
young
knight
the
duke
of
burgundy
is
a
mile
hence
with
a
body
of
horse
to
support
the
reconnoitring
party
it
is
not
half
an
hour
since
your
father
galloped
up
and
stated
that
you
had
been
led
into
an
ambuscade
by
the
treachery
of
the
stradiots
and
made
prisoner
he
has
impeached
of
treason
and
challenged
him
to
the
combat
they
have
both
been
sent
to
the
camp
under
charge
of
the
grand
marshal
to
prevent
their
fighting
on
the
spot
though
i
think
our
italian
showed
little
desire
to
come
to
blows
the
duke
holds
their
gages
and
they
are
to
fight
upon
twelfth
day
i
doubt
that
day
will
never
dawn
for
some
who
look
for
it
said
arthur
but
if
it
do
i
will
myself
claim
the
combat
by
my
permission
he
then
turned
with
contay
and
met
a
still
larger
body
of
cavalry
under
the
duke
broad
banner
he
was
instantly
brought
before
charles
the
duke
heard
with
some
apparent
anxiety
arthur
support
of
his
father
accusations
against
the
italian
in
whose
favour
he
was
so
deeply
prejudiced
when
assured
that
the
stradiots
had
been
across
the
hill
and
communicated
with
their
leader
just
before
he
encouraged
arthur
to
advance
as
it
proved
into
the
midst
of
an
ambush
the
duke
shook
his
head
lowered
his
shaggy
brows
and
muttered
to
himself
ill
will
to
oxford
perhaps
these
italians
are
vindictive
then
raising
his
head
he
commanded
arthur
to
proceed
he
heard
with
a
species
of
ecstasy
the
death
of
rudolph
donnerhugel
and
taking
a
ponderous
gold
chain
from
his
own
neck
flung
it
over
arthur
why
thou
hast
forestalled
all
our
honours
young
arthur
this
was
the
biggest
bear
of
them
all
the
rest
are
but
suckling
whelps
to
him
i
think
i
have
found
a
youthful
david
to
match
their
huge
goliath
but
the
idiot
to
think
his
peasant
hand
could
manage
a
lance
well
my
brave
boy
what
more
how
camest
thou
off
by
some
wily
device
or
agile
stratagem
i
warrant
pardon
me
my
lord
answered
arthur
i
was
protected
by
their
chief
ferrand
who
considered
my
encounter
with
rudolph
donnerhugel
as
a
personal
duel
and
desirous
to
use
fair
war
as
he
said
dismissed
me
honourably
with
my
horse
and
arms
umph
said
charles
his
bad
humour
returning
your
prince
adventurer
must
play
the
generous
umph
well
it
belongs
to
his
part
but
shall
not
be
a
line
for
me
to
square
my
conduct
by
proceed
with
your
story
sir
arthur
de
vere
as
arthur
proceeded
to
tell
how
and
under
what
circumstances
count
albert
of
geierstein
named
himself
to
him
the
duke
fixed
on
him
an
eager
look
and
trembled
with
impatience
as
he
fiercely
interrupted
him
with
the
question
and
you
you
struck
him
with
your
poniard
under
the
fifth
rib
did
you
not
i
did
not
my
lord
duke
we
were
pledged
in
mutual
assurance
to
each
other
yet
you
knew
him
to
be
my
mortal
enemy
said
the
duke
go
young
man
thy
lukewarm
indifference
has
cancelled
thy
merit
the
escape
of
albert
of
geierstein
hath
counterbalanced
the
death
of
rudolph
donnerhugel
be
it
so
my
lord
said
arthur
boldly
i
neither
claim
your
praises
nor
deprecate
your
censure
i
had
to
move
me
in
either
case
motives
personal
to
myself
donnerhugel
was
my
enemy
and
to
count
albert
i
owe
some
kindness
the
burgundian
nobles
who
stood
around
were
terrified
for
the
effect
of
this
bold
speech
but
it
was
never
possible
to
guess
with
accuracy
how
such
things
would
affect
charles
he
looked
around
him
with
a
laugh
hear
you
this
english
cockerel
my
lords
what
a
note
will
he
one
day
sound
that
already
crows
so
bravely
in
a
prince
presence
a
few
horsemen
now
came
in
from
different
quarters
recounting
that
the
duke
ferrand
and
his
company
had
retired
into
their
encampment
and
the
country
was
clear
of
the
enemy
let
us
then
draw
back
also
said
charles
since
there
is
no
chance
of
breaking
spears
and
thou
arthur
de
vere
attend
me
closely
arrived
in
the
duke
pavilion
arthur
underwent
an
examination
in
which
he
said
nothing
of
anne
of
geierstein
or
her
father
designs
concerning
him
with
which
he
considered
charles
as
having
nothing
to
do
but
he
frankly
conveyed
to
him
the
personal
threats
which
the
count
had
openly
used
the
duke
listened
with
more
temper
and
when
he
heard
the
expression
that
a
man
who
is
desperate
of
his
own
life
might
command
that
of
any
other
person
he
said
but
there
is
a
life
beyond
this
in
which
he
who
is
treacherously
murdered
and
his
base
and
desperate
assassin
shall
each
meet
their
deserts
he
then
took
from
his
bosom
a
gold
cross
and
kissed
it
with
much
appearance
of
devotion
in
this
said
he
i
will
place
my
trust
if
i
fail
in
this
world
may
i
find
grace
in
the
ho
sir
marshal
he
exclaimed
let
your
prisoners
attend
us
the
marshal
of
burgundy
entered
with
the
earl
of
oxford
and
stated
that
his
other
prisoner
had
desired
so
earnestly
that
he
might
be
suffered
to
go
and
post
his
sentinels
on
that
part
of
the
camp
intrusted
to
the
protection
of
his
troops
that
he
the
marshal
had
thought
fit
to
comply
with
his
request
it
is
well
said
burgundy
without
further
remark
then
to
you
my
lord
oxford
i
would
present
your
son
had
you
not
already
locked
him
in
your
arms
he
has
won
great
los
and
honour
and
done
me
brave
service
this
is
a
period
of
the
year
when
good
men
forgive
their
enemies
i
know
not
why
my
mind
was
little
apt
to
be
charged
with
such
matters
but
i
feel
an
unconquerable
desire
to
stop
the
approaching
combat
betwixt
you
and
for
my
sake
consent
to
be
friends
and
to
receive
back
your
gage
of
battle
and
let
me
conclude
this
year
perhaps
the
last
i
may
see
with
a
deed
of
peace
my
lord
said
oxford
it
is
a
small
thing
you
ask
of
me
since
your
request
only
enforces
a
christian
duty
i
was
enraged
at
the
loss
of
my
son
i
am
grateful
to
heaven
and
your
grace
for
restoring
him
to
be
friends
with
is
to
me
impossible
faith
and
treason
truth
and
falsehood
might
as
soon
shake
hands
and
embrace
but
the
italian
shall
be
to
me
no
more
than
he
has
been
before
this
rupture
and
that
is
literally
nothing
i
put
my
honour
in
your
hands
if
he
receives
back
his
gage
i
am
willing
to
receive
mine
john
de
vere
needs
not
be
apprehensive
that
the
world
will
suppose
that
he
fears
the
duke
returned
sincere
thanks
and
detained
the
officers
to
spend
the
evening
in
his
tent
his
manners
seemed
to
arthur
to
be
more
placid
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
before
while
to
the
earl
of
oxford
they
recalled
the
earlier
days
in
which
their
intimacy
commenced
ere
absolute
power
and
unbounded
success
had
spoiled
charles
rough
but
not
ungenerous
disposition
the
duke
ordered
a
distribution
of
provisions
and
wine
to
the
soldiers
and
expressed
an
anxiety
about
their
lodgings
the
cure
of
the
wounded
and
the
health
of
the
army
to
which
he
received
only
unpleasing
answers
to
some
of
his
counsellors
apart
he
said
were
it
not
for
our
vow
we
would
relinquish
this
purpose
till
spring
when
our
poor
soldiers
might
take
the
field
with
less
of
suffering
nothing
else
remarkable
appeared
in
the
duke
manner
save
that
he
inquired
repeatedly
after
and
at
length
received
accounts
that
he
was
indisposed
and
that
his
physician
had
recommended
rest
he
had
therefore
retired
to
repose
himself
in
order
that
he
might
be
stirring
on
his
duty
at
peep
of
day
the
safety
of
the
camp
depending
much
on
his
vigilance
the
duke
made
no
observation
on
the
apology
which
he
considered
as
indicating
some
lurking
disinclination
on
the
italian
part
to
meet
oxford
the
guests
at
the
ducal
pavilion
were
dismissed
an
hour
before
midnight
when
oxford
and
his
son
were
in
their
own
tent
the
earl
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
which
lasted
nearly
ten
minutes
at
length
starting
suddenly
up
he
said
my
son
give
orders
to
thiebault
and
thy
yeomen
to
have
our
horses
before
the
tent
by
break
of
day
or
rather
before
it
and
it
would
not
be
amiss
if
you
ask
our
neighbour
colvin
to
ride
along
with
us
i
will
visit
the
outposts
by
daybreak
it
is
a
sudden
resolution
my
lord
said
arthur
and
yet
it
may
be
taken
too
late
said
his
father
had
it
been
moonlight
i
would
have
made
the
rounds
it
is
dark
as
a
wolf
throat
said
arthur
but
wherefore
my
lord
can
this
night
in
particular
excite
your
apprehensions
son
arthur
perhaps
you
will
hold
your
father
credulous
but
my
nurse
martha
nixon
was
a
northern
woman
and
full
of
superstitions
in
particular
she
was
wont
to
say
that
any
sudden
and
causeless
change
of
a
man
nature
as
from
licence
to
sobriety
from
temperance
to
indulgence
from
avarice
to
extravagance
from
prodigality
to
love
of
money
or
the
like
indicates
an
immediate
change
of
his
fortunes
that
some
great
alteration
of
circumstances
either
for
good
or
evil
and
for
evil
most
likely
since
we
live
in
an
evil
world
is
impending
over
him
whose
disposition
is
so
much
altered
this
old
woman
fancy
has
recurred
so
strongly
to
my
mind
that
i
am
determined
to
see
with
mine
own
eyes
ere
dawn
that
all
our
guards
and
patrols
around
the
camp
are
on
the
alert
arthur
made
the
necessary
communications
to
colvin
and
to
thiebault
and
then
retired
to
rest
it
was
ere
daybreak
of
the
first
of
january
a
period
long
memorable
for
the
events
which
marked
it
that
the
earl
of
oxford
colvin
and
the
young
englishman
followed
only
by
thiebault
and
two
other
servants
commenced
their
rounds
of
the
duke
of
encampment
for
the
greater
part
of
their
progress
they
found
sentinels
and
guards
all
on
the
alert
and
at
their
posts
it
was
a
bitter
morning
the
ground
was
partly
covered
with
snow
that
snow
had
been
partly
melted
by
a
thaw
which
had
prevailed
for
two
days
and
partly
congealed
into
ice
by
a
bitter
frost
which
had
commenced
the
preceding
evening
and
still
continued
a
more
dreary
scene
could
scarcely
be
witnessed
but
what
were
the
surprise
and
alarm
of
the
earl
of
oxford
and
his
companions
when
they
came
to
that
part
of
the
camp
which
had
been
occupied
the
day
before
by
and
his
italians
who
reckoning
and
stradiots
amounted
to
nigh
two
thousand
men
not
a
challenge
was
given
not
a
horse
neighed
no
steeds
were
seen
at
picket
no
guard
on
the
camp
they
examined
several
of
the
tents
and
huts
they
were
empty
let
us
back
to
alarm
the
camp
said
the
earl
of
oxford
here
is
treachery
nay
my
lord
said
colvin
let
us
not
carry
back
imperfect
tidings
i
have
a
battery
an
hundred
yards
in
advance
covering
the
access
to
this
hollow
way
let
us
see
if
my
german
cannoneers
are
at
their
post
and
i
think
i
can
swear
that
we
shall
find
them
so
the
battery
commands
a
narrow
pass
by
which
alone
the
camp
can
be
approached
and
if
my
men
are
at
their
duty
i
will
pawn
my
life
that
we
make
the
pass
good
till
you
bring
up
succours
from
the
main
body
forward
then
in
god
name
said
the
earl
of
oxford
they
galloped
at
every
risk
over
broken
ground
slippery
with
ice
in
some
places
incumbered
with
snow
in
others
they
came
to
the
cannon
judiciously
placed
to
sweep
the
pass
which
rose
towards
the
artillery
on
the
outward
side
and
then
descended
gently
from
the
battery
into
the
lower
ground
the
waning
winter
moon
mingling
with
the
dawning
light
showed
them
that
the
guns
were
in
their
places
but
no
sentinel
was
visible
the
villains
can
not
have
deserted
said
the
astonished
colvin
but
see
there
is
light
in
their
cantonment
oh
that
unhallowed
distribution
of
wine
their
usual
sin
of
drunkenness
has
beset
them
i
will
soon
drive
them
from
their
revelry
he
sprang
from
his
horse
and
rushed
into
the
tent
whence
the
light
issued
the
cannoneers
or
most
of
them
were
still
there
but
stretched
on
the
ground
their
cups
and
flagons
scattered
around
them
and
so
drenched
were
they
in
wassail
that
colvin
could
only
by
commands
and
threats
awaken
two
or
three
who
staggering
and
obeying
him
rather
from
instinct
than
sense
reeled
forward
to
man
the
battery
a
heavy
rushing
sound
like
that
of
men
marching
fast
was
now
heard
coming
up
the
pass
it
is
the
roar
of
a
distant
avalanche
said
arthur
it
is
an
avalanche
of
switzers
not
of
snow
said
colvin
oh
these
drunken
slaves
the
cannon
are
deeply
loaded
and
well
pointed
this
volley
must
check
them
if
they
were
fiends
and
the
report
will
alarm
the
camp
sooner
than
we
can
do
but
oh
these
drunken
villains
care
not
for
their
aid
said
the
earl
my
son
and
i
will
each
take
a
linstock
and
be
gunners
for
once
they
dismounted
and
bade
thiebault
and
the
grooms
look
to
the
horses
while
the
earl
of
oxford
and
his
son
took
each
a
linstock
from
one
of
the
helpless
gunners
three
of
whom
were
just
sober
enough
to
stand
by
their
guns
bravo
cried
the
bold
master
of
ordnance
never
was
a
battery
so
noble
now
my
mates
your
pardon
my
lords
for
there
is
no
time
for
ceremony
and
you
ye
drunken
knaves
take
heed
not
to
fire
till
i
give
the
word
and
were
the
ribs
of
these
tramplers
as
flinty
as
their
alps
they
shall
know
how
old
colvin
loads
his
guns
they
stood
breathless
each
by
his
cannon
the
dreaded
sound
approached
nearer
and
more
near
till
the
imperfect
light
showed
a
dark
and
shadowy
but
dense
column
of
men
armed
with
long
spears
and
other
weapons
amidst
which
banners
dimly
floated
colvin
suffered
them
to
approach
to
the
distance
of
about
forty
yards
and
then
gave
the
word
fire
but
his
own
piece
alone
exploded
a
slight
flame
flashed
from
the
of
the
others
which
had
been
spiked
by
the
italian
deserters
and
left
in
reality
disabled
though
apparently
fit
for
service
had
they
been
all
in
the
same
condition
with
that
fired
by
colvin
they
would
probably
have
verified
his
prophecy
for
even
that
single
discharge
produced
an
awful
effect
and
made
a
long
lane
of
dead
and
wounded
through
the
swiss
column
in
which
the
first
and
leading
banner
was
struck
down
stand
to
it
yet
said
colvin
and
aid
me
if
possible
to
reload
the
piece
for
this
however
no
time
was
allowed
a
stately
form
conspicuous
in
the
front
of
the
staggered
column
raised
up
the
fallen
banner
and
a
voice
as
of
a
giant
exclaimed
what
countrymen
have
you
seen
murten
and
granson
and
are
you
daunted
by
a
single
gun
berne
uri
schwitz
banners
forward
unterwalden
here
is
your
standard
cry
your
wind
your
horns
unterwalden
follow
your
landamman
they
rushed
on
like
a
raging
ocean
with
a
roar
as
deafening
and
a
course
as
impetuous
colvin
still
labouring
to
reload
his
gun
was
struck
down
in
the
act
oxford
and
his
son
were
overthrown
by
the
multitude
the
closeness
of
which
prevented
any
blows
being
aimed
at
them
arthur
partly
saved
himself
by
getting
under
the
gun
he
was
posted
at
his
father
less
fortunate
was
much
trampled
upon
and
must
have
been
crushed
to
death
but
for
his
armour
of
proof
the
human
inundation
consisting
of
at
least
four
thousand
men
rushed
down
into
the
camp
continuing
their
dreadful
shouts
soon
mingled
with
shrill
shrieks
groans
and
cries
of
alarm
a
broad
red
glare
rising
behind
the
assailants
and
putting
to
shame
the
pallid
lights
of
the
winter
morning
first
recalled
arthur
to
a
sense
of
his
condition
the
camp
was
on
fire
in
his
rear
and
resounded
with
all
the
various
shouts
of
conquest
and
terror
that
are
heard
in
a
town
which
is
stormed
starting
to
his
feet
he
looked
around
him
for
his
father
he
lay
near
him
senseless
as
were
the
gunners
whose
condition
prevented
their
attempting
an
escape
having
opened
his
father
casque
he
was
rejoiced
to
see
him
give
symptoms
of
reanimation
the
horses
the
horses
said
arthur
thiebault
where
art
thou
at
hand
my
lord
said
that
trusty
attendant
who
had
saved
himself
and
his
charge
by
a
prudent
retreat
into
a
small
thicket
which
the
assailants
had
avoided
that
they
might
not
disorder
their
ranks
where
is
the
gallant
colvin
said
the
earl
get
him
a
horse
i
will
not
leave
him
in
jeopardy
his
wars
are
ended
my
lord
said
thiebault
he
will
never
mount
steed
more
a
look
and
a
sigh
as
he
saw
colvin
with
the
ramrod
in
his
hand
before
the
muzzle
of
the
piece
his
head
cleft
by
a
swiss
was
all
the
moment
permitted
whither
must
we
take
our
course
said
arthur
to
his
father
to
join
the
duke
said
the
earl
of
oxford
it
is
not
on
a
day
like
this
that
i
will
leave
him
so
please
you
said
thiebault
i
saw
the
duke
followed
by
some
of
his
guards
riding
at
full
speed
across
this
hollow
watercourse
and
making
for
the
open
country
to
the
northward
i
think
i
can
guide
you
on
the
track
if
that
be
so
replied
oxford
we
will
mount
and
follow
him
the
camp
has
been
assailed
on
several
places
at
once
and
all
must
be
over
since
he
has
fled
with
difficulty
they
assisted
the
earl
of
oxford
to
his
horse
and
rode
as
fast
as
his
returning
strength
permitted
in
the
direction
which
the
provençal
pointed
out
their
other
attendants
were
dispersed
or
slain
they
looked
back
more
than
once
on
the
camp
now
one
great
scene
of
conflagration
by
whose
red
and
glaring
light
they
could
discover
on
the
ground
the
traces
of
charles
retreat
about
three
miles
from
the
scene
of
their
defeat
the
sound
of
which
they
still
heard
mingled
with
the
bells
of
nancy
which
were
ringing
in
triumph
they
reached
a
swamp
round
which
lay
several
dead
bodies
the
most
conspicuous
was
that
of
charles
of
burgundy
once
the
possessor
of
such
unlimited
power
such
unbounded
wealth
he
was
partly
stripped
and
plundered
as
were
those
who
lay
round
him
his
body
was
pierced
with
several
wounds
inflicted
by
various
weapons
his
sword
was
still
in
his
hand
and
the
singular
ferocity
which
was
wont
to
animate
his
features
in
battle
still
dwelt
on
his
stiffened
countenance
close
behind
him
as
if
they
had
fallen
in
the
act
of
mutual
fight
lay
the
corpse
of
count
albert
of
geierstein
and
that
of
ital
schreckenwald
the
faithful
though
unscrupulous
follower
of
the
latter
lay
not
far
distant
both
were
in
the
dress
of
the
composing
the
duke
guard
a
disguise
probably
assumed
to
execute
the
fatal
commission
of
the
secret
tribunal
it
is
supposed
that
a
party
of
the
traitor
men
had
been
engaged
in
the
skirmish
in
which
the
duke
fell
for
six
or
seven
of
them
and
about
the
same
number
of
the
duke
guards
were
found
near
the
spot
the
earl
of
oxford
threw
himself
from
his
horse
and
examined
the
body
of
his
deceased
with
all
the
sorrow
inspired
by
early
remembrance
of
his
kindness
but
as
he
gave
way
to
the
feelings
inspired
by
so
melancholy
an
example
of
the
fall
of
human
greatness
thiebault
who
was
looking
out
on
the
path
they
had
just
pursued
exclaimed
to
horse
my
lord
here
is
no
time
to
mourn
the
dead
and
little
to
save
the
living
the
swiss
are
upon
us
fly
thyself
good
fellow
said
the
earl
and
do
thou
arthur
fly
also
and
save
thy
youth
for
happier
days
i
can
not
and
will
not
fly
farther
i
will
render
me
to
the
pursuers
if
they
take
me
to
grace
it
is
well
if
not
there
is
one
above
that
will
receive
me
to
his
i
will
not
fly
said
arthur
and
leave
you
defenceless
i
will
stay
and
share
your
fate
and
i
will
remain
also
said
thiebault
the
switzers
make
fair
war
when
their
blood
has
not
been
heated
by
much
opposition
and
they
have
had
little
enough
the
party
of
swiss
which
came
up
proved
to
be
sigismund
with
his
brother
ernest
and
some
of
the
youths
of
unterwalden
sigismund
kindly
and
joyfully
received
them
to
mercy
and
thus
for
the
third
time
rendered
arthur
an
important
service
in
return
for
the
kindness
he
had
expressed
towards
him
i
will
take
you
to
my
father
said
sigismund
who
will
be
right
glad
to
see
you
only
that
he
is
ill
at
ease
just
now
for
the
death
of
brother
rudiger
who
fell
with
the
banner
in
his
hand
by
the
only
cannon
that
was
fired
this
morning
the
rest
could
not
bark
had
muzzled
colvin
mastiffs
or
we
should
many
more
of
us
have
been
served
like
poor
rudiger
but
colvin
himself
is
killed
then
was
in
your
correspondence
said
arthur
not
in
ours
we
scorn
such
companions
but
some
dealing
there
was
between
the
italian
and
duke
ferrand
and
having
disabled
the
cannon
and
filled
the
german
gunners
soundly
drunk
he
came
off
to
our
camp
with
fifteen
hundred
horse
and
offered
to
act
with
us
no
no
said
my
father
come
not
into
our
swiss
host
and
so
though
we
walked
in
at
the
door
which
he
left
open
we
would
not
have
his
company
so
he
marched
with
duke
ferrand
to
attack
the
other
extremity
of
the
camp
where
he
found
them
entrance
by
announcing
them
as
the
return
of
a
reconnoitring
party
nay
then
said
arthur
a
more
accomplished
traitor
never
drew
breath
nor
one
who
drew
his
net
with
such
success
you
say
well
answered
the
young
swiss
the
duke
will
never
they
say
be
able
to
collect
another
army
never
young
man
said
the
earl
of
oxford
for
he
lies
dead
before
you
sigismund
started
for
he
had
an
inherent
respect
and
somewhat
of
fear
for
the
lofty
name
of
charles
the
bold
and
could
hardly
believe
that
the
mangled
corpse
which
now
lay
before
him
was
once
the
personage
he
had
been
taught
to
dread
but
his
surprise
was
mingled
with
sorrow
when
he
saw
the
body
of
his
uncle
count
albert
of
geierstein
oh
my
uncle
he
said
my
dear
uncle
albert
has
all
your
greatness
and
your
wisdom
brought
you
to
a
death
at
the
side
of
a
ditch
like
any
crazed
beggar
come
this
sad
news
must
be
presently
told
to
my
father
who
will
be
concerned
to
hear
of
his
brother
death
which
will
add
gall
to
bitterness
coming
on
the
back
of
poor
rudiger
it
is
some
comfort
however
that
father
and
uncle
never
could
abide
each
other
with
some
difficulty
they
once
more
assisted
the
earl
of
oxford
to
horseback
and
were
proceeding
to
set
forward
when
the
english
lord
said
you
will
place
a
guard
here
to
save
these
bodies
from
further
dishonour
that
they
may
be
interred
with
due
solemnity
by
our
lady
of
einsiedlen
i
thank
you
for
the
hint
said
sigismund
yes
we
should
do
all
that
the
church
can
for
uncle
albert
it
is
to
be
hoped
he
has
not
gambled
away
his
soul
beforehand
playing
with
satan
at
odds
and
evens
i
would
we
had
a
priest
to
stay
by
his
poor
body
but
it
matters
not
since
no
one
ever
heard
of
a
demon
appearing
just
before
breakfast
they
proceeded
to
the
landamman
quarters
through
sights
and
scenes
which
arthur
and
even
his
father
so
well
accustomed
to
war
in
all
its
shapes
could
not
look
upon
without
shuddering
but
the
simple
sigismund
as
he
walked
by
arthur
side
contrived
to
hit
upon
a
theme
so
interesting
as
to
divert
his
sense
of
the
horrors
around
them
have
you
further
business
in
burgundy
now
this
duke
of
yours
is
at
an
end
my
father
knows
best
said
arthur
but
i
apprehend
we
have
none
the
duchess
of
burgundy
who
must
now
succeed
to
some
sort
of
authority
in
her
late
husband
dominion
is
sister
to
this
edward
of
york
and
a
mortal
enemy
to
the
house
of
lancaster
and
to
those
who
have
stood
by
it
faithfully
it
were
neither
prudent
nor
safe
to
tarry
where
she
has
influence
in
that
case
said
sigismund
my
plan
will
fadge
bravely
you
shall
go
back
to
geierstein
and
take
up
your
dwelling
with
us
your
father
will
be
a
brother
to
mine
and
a
better
one
than
uncle
albert
whom
he
seldom
saw
or
spoke
with
while
with
your
father
he
will
converse
from
morning
till
night
and
leave
us
all
the
work
of
the
farm
and
you
arthur
you
shall
go
with
us
and
be
a
brother
to
us
all
in
place
of
poor
rudiger
who
was
to
be
sure
my
real
brother
which
you
can
not
be
nevertheless
i
did
not
like
him
so
well
in
respect
he
was
not
so
and
then
anne
cousin
anne
is
left
all
to
my
charge
and
is
now
at
geierstein
and
you
know
king
arthur
we
used
to
call
her
queen
guenover
you
spoke
great
folly
then
said
arthur
but
it
is
great
truth
for
look
you
i
loved
to
tell
anne
tales
of
our
hunting
and
so
forth
but
she
would
not
listen
a
word
till
i
threw
in
something
of
king
arthur
and
then
i
warrant
she
would
sit
still
as
a
when
the
hawk
is
in
the
heavens
and
now
donnerhugel
is
slain
you
know
you
may
marry
my
cousin
when
you
and
she
will
for
nobody
hath
interest
to
prevent
it
arthur
blushed
with
pleasure
under
his
helmet
and
almost
forgave
that
morning
all
its
complicated
distresses
you
forget
he
replied
to
sigismund
with
as
much
indifference
as
he
could
assume
that
i
may
be
viewed
in
your
country
with
prejudice
on
account
of
rudolph
death
not
a
whit
not
a
whit
we
bear
no
malice
for
what
is
done
in
fair
fight
under
shield
it
is
no
more
than
if
you
had
beat
him
in
wrestling
or
at
quoits
only
it
is
a
game
can
not
be
played
over
again
they
now
entered
the
town
of
nancy
the
windows
were
hung
with
tapestry
and
the
streets
crowded
with
tumultuous
and
rejoicing
multitudes
whom
the
success
of
the
battle
had
relieved
from
great
alarm
for
the
formidable
vengeance
of
charles
of
burgundy
the
prisoners
were
received
with
the
utmost
kindness
by
the
landamman
who
assured
them
of
his
protection
and
friendship
he
appeared
to
support
the
death
of
his
son
rudiger
with
stern
resignation
he
had
rather
he
said
his
son
fell
in
battle
than
that
he
should
live
to
despise
the
old
simplicity
of
his
country
and
think
the
object
of
combat
was
the
gaining
of
spoil
the
gold
of
the
dead
burgundy
he
added
would
injure
the
morals
of
switzerland
more
irretrievably
than
ever
his
sword
did
their
bodies
he
heard
of
his
brother
death
without
surprise
but
apparently
with
emotion
it
was
the
conclusion
he
said
of
a
long
tissue
of
ambitious
enterprises
which
often
offered
fair
prospects
but
uniformly
ended
in
disappointment
the
landamman
further
intimated
that
his
brother
had
apprised
him
that
he
was
engaged
in
an
affair
of
so
much
danger
that
he
was
almost
certain
to
perish
in
it
and
had
bequeathed
his
daughter
to
her
uncle
care
with
instructions
respecting
her
here
they
parted
for
the
present
but
shortly
after
the
landamman
inquired
earnestly
of
the
earl
of
oxford
what
his
motions
were
like
to
be
and
whether
he
could
assist
them
i
think
of
choosing
bretagne
for
my
place
of
refuge
answered
the
earl
where
my
wife
has
dwelt
since
the
battle
of
tewkesbury
expelled
us
from
england
do
not
so
said
the
kind
landamman
but
come
to
geierstein
with
the
countess
where
if
she
can
like
you
endure
our
mountain
manners
and
mountain
fare
you
are
welcome
as
to
the
house
of
a
brother
to
a
soil
where
neither
conspiracy
nor
treason
ever
flourished
bethink
you
the
duke
of
bretagne
is
a
weak
prince
entirely
governed
by
a
wicked
favourite
peter
landais
he
is
as
capable
i
mean
the
minister
of
selling
brave
men
blood
as
a
butcher
of
selling
bullock
flesh
and
you
know
there
are
those
both
in
france
and
burgundy
that
thirst
after
yours
the
earl
of
oxford
expressed
his
thanks
for
the
proposal
and
his
determination
to
profit
by
it
if
approved
of
by
henry
of
lancaster
earl
of
richmond
whom
he
now
regarded
as
his
sovereign
to
close
the
tale
about
three
months
after
the
battle
of
nancy
the
banished
earl
of
oxford
resumed
his
name
of
philipson
bringing
with
his
lady
some
remnants
of
their
former
wealth
which
enabled
them
to
procure
a

the

strongly
of

which
had
been
spoken
for
so
many

in

the

and
the
richness
and
fertility
of
a
country
abounding
in
all
that
could
delight
the
senses
and
soothe
the
imagination
naturally
disposed
the
inhabitants
to
cultivate
the
art
of
poetry
and
to
value
and
foster
the
genius
of
those
who
distinguished
themselves
by
attaining
excellence
in
it

is
or
equivalent
to
the
northern
term
of
arose
in
every
class
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
and
success
in
their
art
dignified
men
of
the
meanest
rank
and
added
fresh
honours
to
those
who
were
born
in
the
patrician
file
of
society
war
and
love
more
especially
the
latter
were
dictated
to
them
by
the
chivalry
of
the
times
as
the
especial
subjects
of
their
verse
such
too
were
the
themes
of
our
northern
minstrels
but
whilst
the
latter
confined
themselves
in
general
to
those
metrical
histories
in
which
scenes
of
strife
and
combat
mingled
with
adventures
of
enchantment
and
fables
of
giants
and
monsters
subdued
by
valiant
champions
such
as
best
attracted
the
ears
of
the
somewhat
duller
and
more
barbarous
warriors
of
northern
france
of
britain
and
of
germany
the
more
lively
troubadours
produced
poems
which
turned
on
human
passion
and
on
love
affection
and
dutiful
observance
with
which
the
faithful
knight
was
bound
to
regard
the
object
of
his
choice
and
the
honour
and
respect
with
which
she
was
bound
to
recompense
his
faithful
services
thus
far
it
can
not
be
disputed
that
the
themes
selected
by
the
troubadours
were
those
on
which
poetry
is
most
naturally
exerted
and
with
the
best
chance
of
rising
to
excellence
but
it
usually
happens
that
when
any
one
of
the
fine
arts
is
cultivated
exclusively
the
taste
of
those
who
practise
and
admire
its
productions
loses
sight
of
nature
simplicity
and
true
taste
and
the
artist
endeavours
to
discover
while
the
public
learn
to
admire
some
more
complicated
system
in
which
pedantry
supersedes
the
dictates
of
natural
feeling
and
metaphysical
ingenuity
is
used
instead
of
the
more
obvious
qualifications
of
simplicity
and
good
sense
thus
with
the
unanimous
approbation
of
their
hearers
the
troubadours
framed
for
themselves
a
species
of
poetry
describing
and
inculcating
a
system
of
metaphysical
affection
as
inconsistent
with
nature
as
the
minstrel
tales
of
magicians
and
monsters
with
this
evil
to
society
that
it
was
calculated
deeply
to
injure
its
manners
and
its
morals
every
troubadour
or
good
knight
who
took
the
maxims
of
their
poetical
school
for
his
rule
was
bound
to
choose
a
lady
love
the
fairest
and
noblest
to
whom
he
had
access
to
whom
he
dedicated
at
once
his
lyre
and
his
sword
and
who
married
or
single
was
to
be
the
object
to
whom
his
life
words
and
actions
were
to
be
devoted
on
the
other
hand
a
lady
thus
honoured
and
distinguished
was
bound
by
accepting
the
services
of
such
a
gallant
to
consider
him
as
her
lover
and
on
all
due
occasions
to
grace
him
as
such
with
distinguished
marks
of
personal
favour
it
is
true
that
according
to
the
best
authorities
the
intercourse
betwixt
her
lover
and
herself
was
to
be
entirely
of
a
platonic
character
and
the
loyal
swain
was
not
to
require
or
the
chosen
lady
to
grant
anything
beyond
the
favour
she
might
in
strict
modesty
bestow
even
under
this
restriction
the
system
was
like
to
make
wild
work
with
the
domestic
peace
of
families
since
it
permitted
or
rather
enjoined
such
familiarity
betwixt
the
fair
dame
and
her
poetical
admirer
and
very
frequently
human
passions
placed
in
such
a
dangerous
situation
proved
too
strong
to
be
confined
within
the
metaphysical
bounds
prescribed
to
them
by
so
fantastic
and
perilous
a
system
the
injured
husbands
on
many
occasions
avenged
themselves
with
severity
and
even
with
dreadful
cruelty
on
the
unfaithful
ladies
and
the
musical
skill
and
chivalrous
character
of
the
lover
proved
no
protection
to
his
person
but
the
real
spirit
of
the
system
was
seen
in
this
that
in
the
poems
of
the
other
troubadours
by
whom
such
events
are
recorded
their
pity
is
all
bestowed
on
the
hapless
lovers
while
without
the
least
allowance
for
just
provocation
the
injured
husband
is
held
up
to
execration

p
high
and
noble
parliament
of
love
in
provence
during
the
flourishing
time
of
the
troubadours
love
was
esteemed
so
grave
and
formal
a
part
of
the
business
of
life
that
a
parliament
or
high
court
of
love
was
appointed
for
deciding
such
questions
this
singular
tribunal
was
it
may
be
supposed
conversant
with
more
of
imaginary
than
of
real
suits
but
it
is
astonishing
with
what
cold
and
pedantic
ingenuity
the
troubadours
of
whom
it
consisted
set
themselves
to
plead
and
to
decide
upon
reasoning
which
was
not
less
singular
and
able
than
out
of
place
the
absurd
questions
which
their
own
fantastic
imaginations
had
previously
devised
there
for
example
is
a
reported
case
of
much
celebrity
where
a
lady
sitting
in
company
with
three
persons
who
were
her
admirers
listened
to
one
with
the
most
favourable
smiles
while
she
pressed
the
hand
of
the
second
and
touched
with
her
own
the
foot
of
the
third
it
was
a
case
much
agitated
and
keenly
contested
in
the
parliament
of
love
which
of
these
rivals
had
received
the
distinguishing
mark
of

much
ingenuity
was
wasted

whose
various
fortunes
he
had
long
watched
with
a
dark
anticipation
that
a
character
so
reckless
and
capable
of
such
excess
must
sooner
or
later
lead
to
a
tragical
result
as
soon
as
the
count
de
arrived
in
the
duke
of
lorrain
army
word
was
sent
him
to
leave
the
camp
immediately
for
they
would
not
entertain
nor
have
any
communication
with
such
traytors
upon
which
message
he
retir
with
his
party
to
a
castle
and
pass
not
far
off
where
he
fortified
himself
with
carts
and
other
things
as
well
as
he
could
in
hopes
that
if
the
duke
of
burgundy
was
routed
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
coming
in
for
a
share
of
the
plunder
as
he
did
afterwards
nor
was
this
practice
with
the
duke
of
lorrain
the
most
execrable
action
that
was
guilty
of
but
before
he
left
the
army
he
conspir
with
several
other
officers
finding
it
was
impracticable
to
attempt
anything
against
the
duke
of
burgundy
person
to
leave
him
just
as
they
came
to
charge
for
at
that
time
he
suppos
it
would
put
the
duke
into
the
greatest
terror
and
consternation
and
if
he
fled
he
was
sure
he
could
not
escape
alive

he
had

thirteen

fourteen

men

to
run

soon
as
the
germans
came
up
to

and
others
to
watch
the

and
kill
him
in
the
rout
which
was
well
enough
contrived
i
myself
have
seen
two
or
three
of
those
who
were
employed
to
kill
the
duke
having
thus
settled
his
conspiracy
at

he
went
over
to
the
duke
of
lorrain
upon
the
approach
of
the
german
army
but
finding
they
would
not
entertain
him
he
retired
to

german
army
marched
forward
and
with
a
considerable
body
of
french
horse
whom
the
king
had
given
leave
to
be
present
at
that
action
several
parties
lay
in
ambush
not
far
off
that
if
the
duke
of
burgundy
was
routed
they
might
surprise
some
person
of
quality
or
take
some
considerable
booty
by
this
every
one
may
see
into
what
a
deplorable
condition
this
poor
duke
had
brought
himself
by
his
contempt
of
good
counsel
both
armies
being

the
duke
of

forces
having
been
twice
beaten
before
and
by
consequence

broken

defeated

sav
themselves

got
off

him
not

he
was

left
him
naked
in
the

his

was

the
next
day
after

the

cut
curiously
upon

i
have
seen
him
often
wear
in
a
ribbon
at
his
breast
which
was
sold
at
milan
for
two
ducats
and
had
been
stolen
from
him
by
a
rascal
that
waited
on
him
in
his

i
have
often
seen
the
duke
dress
and
undress
in
great
state
and
formality
and
attended
by
very
great
persons
but
at
his
death
all
this
pomp
and
magnificence
ceas
and
his
family
was
involv
in
the
same
ruin
with
himself
and
very
likely
as
a
punishment
for
his
having
deliver
up
the
constable
not
long
before
out
of
a
base
and
avaricious
principle
but
god
forgive
him
i
have
known
him
a
powerful
and
honourable
prince
in
as
great
esteem
and
as
much
courted
by
his
neighbours
when
his
affairs
were
in
a
prosperous
condition
as
any
prince
in
europe
and
perhaps
more
and
i
can
not
conceive
what
should
provoke
god
almighty
displeasure
so
highly
against
him
unless
it
was
his
and
arrogance
in
appropriating
all
the
success
of
his
enterprises
and
all
the
renown
he
ever
acquir
to
his
own
wisdom
and
conduct
without
attributing
anything
to

yet
to
speak
truth
he
was
master
of
several
good
qualities
no
prince
ever
had
a
greater
ambition
to
entertain
young
noblemen
than
he
nor
was
more
careful
of
their
education
his
presents
and
bounty
were
never
profuse
and
extravagant
because
he
gave
to
many
and
had
a
mind
everybody
should
taste
of
it
no
prince
was
ever
more
easie
of
access
to
his
servants
and
subjects
whilst
i
was
in
his
service
he
was
never
cruel
but
a
little
before
his
death
he
took
up
that
humour
which
was
an
infallible
sign
of
the
shortness
of
his
life
he
was
very
splendid
and
curious
in
his
dress
and
in
everything
else
and
indeed
a
little
too
much
he
paid
great
honours
to
all
ambassadors
and
foreigners
and
entertain
them
nobly
his
ambitious
desire
of
fame
was
insatiable
and
it
was
that
which
induced
him
to
be
eternally
in
wars
more
than
any
other
motive
he
ambitiously
desir
to
imitate
the
old
kings
and
heroes
of
antiquity
whose
actions
still
shine
in
history
and
are
so
much
talked
of
in
the
world
and
his
courage
was
equal
to
any
prince
of
his
time
but
all
his
designs
and
imaginations
were
vain
and
extravagant
and
turn
afterwards
to
his
own
dishonour
and
confusion
for
is
the
conquerors
and
not
the
conquer
that
purchase
to
themselves
renown
i
can
not
easily
determine
towards
whom
god
almighty
shew
his
anger
most
whether
towards
him
who
died
suddenly
without
pain
or
sickness
in
the
field
of
battle
or
towards
his
subjects
who
never
enjoy
peace
after
his
death
but
were
continually
involv
in
wars
against
which
they
were
not
able
to
maintain
themselves
upon
account
of
the
civil
dissentions
and
cruel
animosities
that
arose
among
and
that
which
was
the
most
insupportable
was
that
the
very
people
to
whom
they
were
now
oblig
for
their
defence
and
preservation
were
the
germans
who
were
strangers
and
not
long
since
their
profess
enemies
in
short
after
the
duke
death
there
was
not
a
neighbouring
state
that
wished
them
to
prosper
nor
even
germany
that
defended
and
by
the
management
of
their
affairs
their
understanding
seem
to
be
as
much
infatuated
as
their
master
for
they
rejected
all
good
counsel
and
pursued
such
methods
as
directly
tended
to
their
destruction
and
they
are
still
in
such
a
condition
that
though
they
have
at
present
some
little
ease
and
relaxation
from
their
sorrows
yet
is
with
great
danger
of
a
relapse
and
is
well
if
it
turns
not
in
the
end
to
their
utter
ruin
i
am
partly
of
their
opinion
who
maintain
that
god
gives
princes
as
he
in
his
wisdom
thinks
fit
to
punish
or
chastise
the
subjects
and
he
disposes
the
affection
of
subjects
to
their
princes
as
he
has
determin
to
raise
or
depress
just
so
it
has
pleas
him
to
deal
with
the
house
of
burgundy
for

long
series
of

charles

involv
them

as

affliction

in

most
of

and

men
were
either
kill

utterly
undone
their
misfortunes
continu
successively
to
the
very
hour
of

after
such
a
manner
that
at

the
whole

country
was
destroy

all
kill
