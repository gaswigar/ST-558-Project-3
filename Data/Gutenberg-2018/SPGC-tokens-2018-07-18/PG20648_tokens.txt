introduction
no
character
in
our
literature
not
even
pickwick
has
more
endeared
himself
to
successive
generations
of
readers
than
addison
sir
roger
de
coverley
there
are
many
figures
in
drama
and
fiction
of
whom
we
feel
that
they
are
in
a
way
personal
friends
of
our
own
that
once
introduced
to
us
they
remain
a
permanent
part
of
our
little
world
it
is
the
abiding
glory
of
dickens
it
is
one
of
shakespeare
abiding
glories
to
have
created
many
such
but
we
look
to
find
these
characters
in
the
novel
or
the
play
the
essay
by
virtue
of
its
limitations
of
space
is
unsuited
for
and
even
in
the
subject
of
our
present
reading
the
difficulty
of
hunting
the
various
coverley
essays
down
in
the
great
number
of
papers
is
some
small
drawback
but
here
before
the
birth
of
the
modern
english
novel
we
have
a
portrait
of
such
a
character
as
we
have
described
in
addition
to
a
number
of
other
more
sketchy
but
still
convincing
delineations
of
english
types
we
are
brought
into
the
society
of
a
fine
country
gentleman
simple
generous
and
upright
with
just
those
touches
of
whimsicality
and
those
lovable
faults
which
go
straight
to
our
hearts
and
all
so
charmingly
described
that
these
essays
have
delighted
all
who
have
read
them
since
they
first
began
to
appear
on
the
of
the
polite
world
in
queen
anne
day
addison
sir
roger
we
have
called
him
and
be
sure
that
honest
dick
steele
even
if
he
drew
the
first
outlines
of
the
figure
would
not
bear
us
a
grudge
for
so
doing
whoever
first
thought
of
sir
roger
and
however
many
little
touches
may
have
been
added
by
other
hands
he
remains
addison
creation
and
furthermore
it
does
not
matter
a
snap
of
the
fingers
whether
any
actual
person
served
as
the
model
from
which
the
picture
was
taken
of
all
the
bootless
quests
that
literary
criticism
can
undertake
this
search
for
the
original
is
the
least
valuable
the
artist
mind
is
a
crucible
which
transmutes
and
to
vary
the
metaphor
the
marble
springs
to
life
under
the
workman
hands
we
can
almost
see
it
happening
in
these
essays
and
we
know
how
often
enough
a
writer
finds
his
own
creation
kicking
over
the
traces
as
it
were
and
becoming
almost
independent
of
his
volition
there
is
no
original
for
sir
roger
or
falstaff
or
micawber
they
may
not
have
sprung
fully
armed
out
of
the
author
head
and
they
may
have
been
suggested
by
some
one
he
had
in
mind
but
once
created
they
came
into
a
life
with
personalities
entirely
of
their
own
a
vastly
more
useful
quest
one
in
fact
of
absorbing
interest
is
the
attempt
to
follow
the
artist
method
to
trace
the
devices
which
he
adopts
to
bring
to
our
notice
all
those
various
traits
by
which
we
judge
of
character
the
prose
writer
has
this
much
advantage
over
the
playwright
that
he
can
represent
his
in
a
greater
number
of
different
situations
and
furthermore
can
criticise
them
and
draw
our
special
attention
to
what
he
wishes
to
have
stressed
he
can
even
say
that
such
and
such
thoughts
and
motives
are
in
their
minds
not
so
the
dramatist
his
space
is
limited
and
he
is
cribbed
cabined
and
confined
by
having
to
give
a
convincing
imitation
of
real
life
where
we
can
not
tell
what
is
going
on
in
the
minds
of
even
our
most
intimate
friends
thus
the
audience
is
often
left
uncertain
of
the
purport
of
what
it
sees
and
hears
the
ugly
and
inartistic
convention
of
the
aside
must
be
used
very
sparingly
if
the
play
is
to
ring
true
and
so
it
is
that
we
shall
find
voluminous
discussions
on
the
subject
for
instance
of
how
shakespeare
meant
such
and
such
a
character
to
be
interpreted
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
character
in
fiction
can
to
this
same
extent
be
more
artificial
it
is
a
test
of
the
and
artistic
restraint
of
the
novelist
if
he
can
refrain
from
diving
too
deep
into
the
unknown
and
arrogating
to
himself
an
impossibly
full
knowledge
of
the
mental
processes
of
other
people
and
now
notice
how
addison
gives
us
just
such
revelations
of
the
old
knight
character
as
the
observant
spectator
would
gather
from
friendly
intercourse
with
him
we
see
sir
roger
at
home
ruling
his
household
and
the
village
with
a
genial
if
somewhat
autocratic
sway
we
see
him
in
london
taking
the
cicerone
who
pilots
him
round
westminster
abbey
for
a
monument
of
wit
and
learning
and
so
on
and
so
forth
there
is
no
need
to
catalogue
these
occasions
what
we
have
said
should
suffice
to
point
out
a
very
fruitful
line
of
study
which
may
help
the
reader
to
a
full
appreciation
of
addison
work
good
wine
needs
no
bush
and
the
coverley
essays
are
good
wine
if
ever
there
was
such
the
study
of
the
style
is
also
of
the
greatest
value
addison
lived
at
a
time
when
our
modern
english
prose
had
recently
found
itself
we
admire
the
splendour
of
the
miltonic
style
and
lose
ourselves
in
the
rich
harmonies
of
sir
thomas
browne
work
but
after
all
prose
is
needed
for
ordinary
purposes
and
must
be
clear
and
straightforward
it
can
still
remain
a
very
attractive
instrument
of
speech
or
writing
and
in
addison
hands
it
fulfilled
to
perfection
the
needs
of
the
essay
style
he
avoids
verbiage
and
excessive
adornment
he
is
content
to
tell
what
he
sees
or
knows
or
thinks
as
simply
as
possible
and
even
with
a
tendency
towards
the
conversational
and
he
has
an
inimitable
feeling
for
just
the
right
word
just
the
most
elegantly
turned
phrase
and
period
do
not
imagine
this
sort
of
thing
is
the
result
of
a
mere
gift
for
style
true
it
could
not
happen
without
that
but
neither
can
it
happen
without
a
great
deal
of
careful
thought
a
scrupulous
choice
and
balancing
of
word
against
word
phrase
against
phrase
because
all
this
is
done
and
because
the
result
is
so
clear
and
runs
so
smoothly
it
requires
an
effort
on
our
part
to
realise
the
great
amount
of
work
involved
est
celare
and
in
such
an
essay
as
that
describing
the
picture
gallery
in
sir
roger
house
we
can
see
the
pictures
in
front
of
our
eyes
precisely
because
the
description
is
so
so
free
from
unnecessary
decoration
and
yet
so
picturesque
and
attractive
a
very
short
acquaintance
will
enable
the
reader
to
appreciate
charming
humour
and
sane
grasp
of
character
the
high
moral
tone
of
his
work
the
and
broad
culture
and
literary
insight
which
caused
the
to
exert
a
profound
influence
over
a
dissolute
age
these
can
only
be
seen
by
a
more
extended
reading
of
the
essays
and
those
who
are
interested
can
not
do
better
than
obtain
some
general
selection
such
as
that
of
arnold
biographical
and
historical
details
are
somewhat
outside
the
scope
of
the
present
essay
a
short
chronological
table
is
appended
and
the
reader
can
not
be
too
strongly
recommended
to
study
johnson
life
of
addison
which
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
lives
of
the
poets
and
in
which
the
literary
criticism
is
in
johnson
best
vein
and
thackeray
contains
some
delightful
passages
introducing
richard
steele
and
his
entourage
with
an
interesting
scene
in
addison
lodgings
it
is
perhaps
as
well
to
mention
that
the
grew
out
of
collaboration
with
steele
in
a
similar
periodical
entitled
the
there
were
several
writers
besides
these
two
concerned
in
the
notably
budgell
the
letters
at
the
end
of
most
of
the
papers
are
signatures
and
are
the
marks
of
addison
work
and
of
steele
and
of
budgell
we
have
stories
of
resentment
of
their
tampering
with
his
favourite
character
it
is
even
said
that
he
killed
the
knight
off
in
his
annoyance
at
one
paper
which
represented
him
in
an
unfitting
situation
we
can
not
judge
of
the
truth
of
such
stories
in
any
case
it
was
addison
who
controlled
the
whole
tenor
and
policy
of
the
paper
wisely
steering
as
clear
as
possible
of
politics
and
thereby
broadening
his
appeal
and
reaching
a
wider
public
and
it
was
addison
kindly
and
mellow
criticism
of
life
that
informed
the
whole
work
his

peruses
a

with
pleasure

he

whether
the
writer
of
it
be

or

with

of

like
nature
that
conduce
very
much
to
the
right
understanding
of
an
author
to
gratify
this
curiosity
which
is
so
natural
to
a
reader
i
design
this
paper
and
my
next
as
prefatory
discourses
to
my
following
writings
and
shall
give
some
account
in
them
of
the
several
persons
that
are
engaged
in
this
work
as
the
chief
trouble
of
compiling
digesting
and
correcting
will
fall
to
my
share
i
must
do
myself
the
justice
to
open
the
work
with
my
own
history
i
was
born
to
a
small
hereditary
estate
which
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
village
where
it
lies
was
bounded
by
the
same
hedges
and
ditches
in
william
the
conqueror
time
that
it
is
at
present
and
has
been
delivered
down
from
father
to
son
whole
and
entire
without
the
loss
or
acquisition
of
a
single
field
or
meadow
during
the
space
of
six
hundred
years
there
runs
a
story
in
the
family
that
before
my
birth
my
mother
dreamt
that
she
was
brought
to
bed
of
a
judge
whether
this
might
proceed
from
a
lawsuit
which
was
then
depending
in
the
family
or
my
father
being
a
justice
of
the
peace
i
can
not
determine
for
i
am
not
so
vain
as
to
think
it
presaged
any
dignity
that
i
should
arrive
at
in
my
future
life
though
that
was
the
interpretation
which
the
neighbourhood
put
upon
it
the
gravity
of
my
behaviour
at
my
very
first
appearance
in
the
world
and
all
the
time
that
i
sucked
seemed
to
favour
my
dream
for
as
she
has
often
told
me
i
threw
away
my
rattle
before
i
was
two
months
old
and
would
not
make
use
of
my
coral
until
they
had
taken
away
the
bells
from
it
as
for
the
rest
of
my
infancy
there
being
nothing
in
it
remarkable
i
shall
pass
it
over
in
silence
i
find
that
during
my
nonage
i
had
the
reputation
of
a
very
sullen
youth
but
was
always
a
favourite
of
my
schoolmaster
who
used
to
say
that
my
parts
were
solid
and
would
wear
well
i
had
not
been
long
at
the
university
before
i
distinguished
myself
by
a
most
profound
silence
for
during
the
space
of
eight
years
excepting
in
the
public
exercises
of
the
college
i
scarce
uttered
the
quantity
of
an
hundred
words
and
indeed
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
spoke
three
sentences
together
in
my
whole
life
whilst
i
was
in
this
learned
body
i
applied
myself
with
so
much
diligence
to
my
studies
that
there
are
very
few
celebrated
books
either
in
the
learned
or
the
modern
tongues
which
i
am
not
acquainted
with
upon
the
death
of
my
father
i
was
resolved
to
travel
into
foreign
countries
and
therefore
left
the
university
with
the
character
of
an
odd
unaccountable
fellow
that
had
a
great
deal
of
learning
if
i
would
but
show
it
an
insatiable
thirst
after
knowledge
carried
me
into
all
the
countries
of
europe
in
which
there
was
anything
new
or
strange
to
be
seen
nay
to
such
a
degree
was
my
curiosity
raised
that
having
read
the
controversies
of
some
great
men
concerning
the
antiquities
of
egypt
i
made
a
voyage
to
grand
cairo
on
purpose
to
take
the
measure
of
a
pyramid
and
as
soon
as
i
had
set
myself
right
in
that
particular
returned
to
my
native
country
with
great
satisfaction
i
have
passed
my
latter
years
in
this
city
where
i
am
frequently
seen
in
most
public
places
though
there
are
not
above
half
a
dozen
of
my
select
friends
that
know
me
of
whom
my
next
paper
shall
give
a
more
particular
account
there
is
no
place
of
general
resort
wherein
i
do
not
often
make
my
appearance
sometimes
i
am
seen
thrusting
my
head
into
a
round
of
politicians
at
will
and
listening
with
great
attention
to
the
narratives
that
are
made
in
those
little
circular
audiences
sometimes
i
smoke
a
pipe
at
child
and
whilst
i
seem
attentive
to
nothing
but
the
overhear
the
conversation
of
every
table
in
the
room
i
appear
on
sunday
nights
at
james
and
sometimes
join
the
little
committee
of
politics
in
the
inner
room
as
one
who
comes
there
to
hear
and
improve
my
face
is
likewise
very
well
known
at
the
grecian
the
and
in
the
theatres
both
of
drury
lane
and
the
i
have
been
taken
for
a
merchant
upon
the
exchange
for
above
these
ten
years
and
sometimes
pass
for
a
jew
in
the
assembly
of
at
jonathan
in
short
wherever
i
see
a
cluster
of
people
i
always
mix
with
them
though
i
never
open
my
lips
but
in
my
own
club
thus
i
live
in
the
world
rather
as
a
spectator
of
mankind
than
as
one
of
the
species
by
which
means
i
have
made
myself
a
speculative
statesman
soldier
merchant
and
artisan
without
ever
meddling
with
any
practical
part
in
life
i
am
very
well
versed
in
the
theory
of
a
husband
or
a
father
and
can
discern
the
errors
in
the
economy
business
and
diversion
of
others
better
than
those
who
are
engaged
in
them
as
discover
blots
which
are
apt
to
escape
those
who
are
in
the
game
i
never
espoused
any
party
with
violence
and
am
resolved
to
observe
an
exact
neutrality
between
the
whigs
and
tories
unless
i
shall
be
forced
to
declare
myself
by
the
hostilities
of
either
side
in
short
i
have
acted
in
all
the
parts
of
my
life
as
a
which
is
the
character
i
intend
to
preserve
in
this
paper
i
have
given
the
reader
just
so
much
of
my
history
and
character
as
to
let
him
see
i
am
not
altogether
unqualified
for
the
business
i
have
undertaken
as
for
other
particulars
in
my
life
and
adventures
i
shall
insert
them
in
following
papers
as
i
shall
see
occasion
in
the
meantime
when
i
consider
how
much
i
have
seen
read
and
heard
i
begin
to
blame
my
own
taciturnity
and
since
i
have
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
communicate
the
fulness
of
my
heart
in
speech
i
am
resolved
to
do
it
in
writing
and
to
print
myself
out
if
possible
before
i
die
i
have
been
often
told
by
my
friends
that
it
is
pity
so
many
useful
discoveries
which
i
have
made
should
be
in
the
possession
of
a
silent
man
for
this
reason
therefore
i
shall
publish
a
of
thoughts
every
morning
for
the
benefit
of
my
contemporaries
and
if
i
can
any
way
contribute
to
the
diversion
or
improvement
of
the
country
in
which
i
live
i
shall
leave
it
when
i
am
summoned
out
of
it
with
the
secret
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
i
have
not
lived
in
vain
there
are
three
very
material
points
which
i
have
not
spoken
to
in
this
paper
and
which
for
several
important
reasons
i
must
keep
to
myself
at
least
for
some
time
i
mean
an
account
of
my
name
my
age
and
my
lodgings
i
must
confess
i
would
gratify
my
reader
in
anything
that
is
reasonable
but
as
for
these
three
particulars
though
i
am
sensible
they
might
tend
very
much
to
the
embellishment
of
my
paper
i
can
not
yet
come
to
a
resolution
of
communicating
them
to
the
public
they
would
indeed
draw
me
out
of
that
obscurity
which
i
have
enjoyed
for
many
years
and
expose
me
in
public
places
to
several
salutes
and
civilities
which
have
been
always
very
disagreeable
to
me
for
the
greatest
pain
i
can
suffer
is
the
being
talked
to
and
being
stared
at
it
is
for
this
reason
likewise
that
i
keep
my
complexion
and
dress
as
very
great
secrets
though
it
is
not
impossible
but
i
may
make
discoveries
of
both
in
the
progress
of
the
work
i
have
undertaken
after
having
been
thus
particular
upon
myself
i
shall
in
paper
give
an
account
of
those
gentlemen
who
are
concerned
with
me
in
this
work
for
as
i
have
before
intimated
a
plan
of
it
is
laid
and
concerted
as
all
other
matters
of
importance
are
in
a

however
as
my

have
engaged
me
to

the
first
of
our
society
is
a
gentleman
of
worcestershire
of
ancient
descent
a
baronet
his
name
is
sir
roger
de
coverley
his
was
inventor
of
that
famous
which
is
called
after
him
all
who
know
that
shire
are
very
well
acquainted
with
the
parts
and
merits
of
sir
roger
he
is
a
gentleman
that
is
very
singular
in
his
behaviour
but
his
singularities
proceed
from
his
good
sense
and
are
contradictions
to
the
manners
of
the
world
only
as
he
thinks
the
world
is
in
the
wrong
however
this
humour
creates
him
no
enemies
for
he
does
nothing
with
sourness
or
obstinacy
and
his
being
unconfined
to
modes
and
forms
makes
him
but
the
readier
and
more
capable
to
please
and
oblige
all
who
know
him
when
he
is
in
town
he
lives
in
soho
square
it
is
said
he
keeps
himself
a
bachelor
by
reason
he
was
crossed
in
love
by
a
perverse
beautiful
widow
of
the
next
county
to
him
before
this
disappointment
sir
roger
was
what
you
call
a
fine
gentleman
had
often
supped
with
my
lord
rochester
and
sir
george
etherege
fought
a
duel
upon
his
first
coming
to
town
and
kicked
bully
dawson
in
a
public
for
calling
him
youngster
but
being
by
the
widow
he
was
very
serious
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
though
his
temper
being
naturally
jovial
he
at
last
got
over
it
he
grew
careless
of
himself
and
never
dressed
afterwards
he
continues
to
wear
a
coat
and
doublet
of
the
same
cut
that
were
in
fashion
at
the
time
of
his
repulse
which
in
his
merry
humours
he
tells
us
has
been
in
and
out
twelve
times
since
he
first
wore
it
he
is
now
in
his
year
cheerful
gay
and
hearty
keeps
a
good
house
both
in
town
and
country
a
great
lover
of
mankind
but
there
is
such
a
mirthful
cast
in
his
behaviour
that
he
is
rather
beloved
than
esteemed
his
tenants
grow
rich
his
servants
look
satisfied
all
the
young
women
profess
love
to
him
and
the
young
men
are
glad
of
his
company
when
he
comes
into
a
house
he
calls
the
servants
by
their
names
and
talks
all
the
way
upstairs
to
a
visit
i
must
not
omit
that
sir
roger
is
a
justice
of
the
quorum
that
he
fills
the
chair
at
a
with
great
abilities
and
three
months
ago
gained
universal
applause
by
explaining
a
passage
in
the

act
the
gentleman
next
in
esteem
and
authority
among
us
is
another
bachelor
who
is
a
member
of
the
inner
temple
a
man
of
great
probity
wit
and
understanding
but
he
has
chosen
his
place
of
residence
rather
to
obey
the
direction
of
an
old
humoursome
father
than
in
pursuit
of
his
own
inclinations
he
was
placed
there
to
study
the
laws
of
the
land
and
is
the
most
learned
of
any
of
the
house
in
those
of
the
stage
aristotle
and
longinus
are
much
better
understood
by
him
than
littleton
or
coke
the
father
sends
up
every
post
questions
relating
to
leases
and
tenures
in
the
neighbourhood
all
which
questions
he
agrees
with
an
attorney
to
answer
and
take
care
of
in
the
lump
he
is
studying
the
passions
themselves
when
he
should
be
inquiring
into
the
debates
among
men
which
arise
from
them
he
knows
the
argument
of
each
of
the
orations
of
demosthenes
and
tully
but
not
one
case
in
the
reports
of
our
own
courts
no
one
ever
took
him
for
a
fool
but
none
except
his
intimate
friends
know
he
has
a
great
deal
of
wit
this
turn
makes
him
at
once
both
disinterested
and
agreeable
as
few
of
his
thoughts
are
drawn
from
business
they
are
most
of
them
fit
for
conversation
his
taste
of
books
is
a
little
too
just
for
the
age
he
lives
in
he
has
read
all
but
approves
of
very
few
his
familiarity
with
the
customs
manners
actions
and
writings
of
the
ancients
makes
him
a
very
delicate
observer
of
what
occurs
to
him
in
the
present
world
he
is
an
excellent
critic
and
the
time
of
the
play
is
his
hour
of
business
exactly
at
five
he
passes
through
new
inn
crosses
through
russell
court
and
takes
a
turn
at
will
until
the
play
begins
he
has
his
shoes
rubbed
and
his
periwig
powdered
at
the
barber
as
you
go
into
the
rose
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
audience
when
he
is
at
a
play
for
the
actors
have
an
ambition
to
please
him
the
person
of
next
consideration
is
sir
andrew
freeport
a
merchant
of
great
eminence
in
the
city
of
london
a
person
of
indefatigable
industry
strong
reason
and
great
experience
his
notions
of
trade
are
noble
and
generous
and
as
every
rich
man
has
usually
some
sly
way
of
jesting
which
would
make
no
great
figure
were
he
not
a
rich
man
he
calls
the
sea
the
british
common
he
is
acquainted
with
commerce
in
all
its
parts
and
will
tell
you
that
it
is
a
stupid
and
barbarous
way
to
extend
dominion
by
arms
for
true
power
is
to
be
got
by
arts
and
industry
he
will
often
argue
that
if
this
part
of
our
trade
were
well
cultivated
we
should
gain
from
one
nation
and
if
another
from
another
i
have
heard
him
prove
that
diligence
makes
more
lasting
acquisitions
than
valour
and
that
sloth
has
ruined
more
nations
than
the
sword
he
abounds
in
several
frugal
maxims
amongst
which
the
greatest
favourite
is
a
penny
saved
is
a
penny
got
a
general
trader
of
good
sense
is
pleasanter
company
than
a
general
scholar
and
sir
andrew
having
a
natural
unaffected
eloquence
the
perspicuity
of
his
discourse
gives
the
same
pleasure
that
wit
would
in
another
man
he
has
made
his
fortunes
himself
and
says
that
england
may
be
richer
than
other
kingdoms
by
as
plain
methods
as
he
himself
is
richer
than
other
men
though
at
the
same
time
i
can
say
this
of
him
that
there
is
not
a
point
in
the
compass
but
blows
home
a
ship
in
which
he
is
an
owner
next
to
sir
andrew
in
the
sits
captain
sentry
a
gentleman
of
great
courage
good
understanding
but
invincible
modesty
he
is
one
of
those
that
deserve
very
well
but
are
very
awkward
at
putting
their
talents
within
the
observation
of
such
as
should
take
notice
of
them
he
was
some
years
a
captain
and
behaved
himself
with
great
gallantry
in
several
engagements
and
at
several
sieges
but
having
a
small
estate
of
his
own
and
being
next
heir
to
sir
roger
he
has
quitted
a
way
of
life
in
which
no
man
can
rise
suitably
to
his
merit
who
is
not
something
of
a
courtier
as
well
as
a
soldier
i
have
heard
him
often
lament
that
in
a
profession
where
merit
is
placed
in
so
conspicuous
a
view
impudence
should
get
the
better
of
modesty
when
he
has
talked
to
this
purpose
i
never
heard
him
make
a
sour
expression
but
frankly
confess
that
he
left
the
world
because
he
was
not
fit
for
it
a
strict
honesty
and
an
even
regular
behaviour
are
in
themselves
obstacles
to
him
that
must
press
through
crowds
who
endeavour
at
the
same
end
with
himself
the
favour
of
a
commander
he
will
however
in
his
way
of
talk
excuse
generals
for
not
disposing
according
to
men
desert
or
inquiring
into
it
for
says
he
that
great
man
who
has
a
mind
to
help
me
has
as
many
to
break
through
to
come
at
me
as
i
have
to
come
at
him
therefore
he
will
conclude
that
the
man
who
would
make
a
figure
especially
in
a
military
way
must
get
over
all
false
modesty
and
assist
his
patron
against
the
importunity
of
other
pretenders
by
a
proper
assurance
in
his
own
vindication
he
says
it
is
a
civil
cowardice
to
be
backward
in
asserting
what
you
ought
to
expect
as
it
is
a
military
fear
to
be
slow
in
attacking
when
it
is
your
duty
with
this
candour
does
the
gentleman
speak
of
himself
and
others
the
same
frankness
runs
through
all
his
conversation
the
military
part
of
his
life
has
furnished
him
with
many
adventures
in
the
relation
of
which
he
is
very
agreeable
to
the
company
for
he
is
never
overbearing
though
accustomed
to
command
men
in
the
utmost
degree
below
him
nor
ever
too
obsequious
from
an
habit
of
obeying
men
highly
above
him
but
that
our
society
may
not
appear
a
set
of
humorists
unacquainted
with
the
gallantries
and
pleasures
of
the
age
we
have
among
us
the
gallant
will
honeycomb
a
gentleman
who
according
to
his
years
should
be
in
the
decline
of
his
life
but
having
ever
been
very
careful
of
his
person
and
always
had
a
very
easy
fortune
time
has
made
but
a
very
little
impression
either
by
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
or
traces
in
his
brain
his
person
is
well
turned
of
a
good
height
he
is
very
ready
at
that
sort
of
discourse
with
which
men
usually
entertain
women
he
has
all
his
life
dressed
very
well
and
remembers
habits
as
others
do
men
he
can
smile
when
one
speaks
to
him
and
laughs
easily
he
knows
the
history
of
every
mode
and
can
inform
you
from
which
of
the
french
ladies
our
wives
and
daughters
had
this
manner
of
curling
their
hair
that
way
of
placing
their
hoods
and
whose
vanity
to
show
her
foot
made
that
part
of
the
dress
so
short
in
such
a
year
in
a
word
all
his
conversation
and
knowledge
have
been
in
the
female
world
as
other
men
of
his
age
will
take
notice
to
you
what
such
a
minister
said
upon
such
and
such
an
occasion
he
will
tell
you
when
the
duke
of
monmouth
danced
at
court
such
a
woman
was
then
smitten
another
was
taken
with
him
at
the
head
of
his
troop
in
the
park
in
all
these
important
relations
he
has
ever
about
the
same
time
received
a
kind
glance
or
a
blow
of
a
fan
from
some
celebrated
beauty
mother
of
the
present
lord
this
way
of
talking
of
his
very
much
enlivens
the
conversation
among
us
of
a
more
sedate
turn
and
i
find
there
is
not
one
of
the
company
but
myself
who
rarely
speak
at
all
but
speaks
of
him
as
of
that
sort
of
man
who
is
usually
called
a
fine
gentleman
to
conclude
his
character
where
women
are
not
concerned
he
is
an
honest
worthy
man
i
can
not
tell
whether
i
am
to
account
him
whom
i
am
next
to
speak
of
as
one
of
our
company
for
he
visits
us
but
seldom
but
when
he
does
it
adds
to
every
man
else
a
new
enjoyment
of
himself
he
is
a
clergyman
a
very
philosophic
man
of
general
learning
great
sanctity
of
life
and
the
most
exact
good
breeding
he
has
the
misfortune
to
be
of
a
very
weak
constitution
and
consequently
can
not
accept
of
such
cares
and
business
as
preferments
in
his
function
would
oblige
him
to
he
is
therefore
among
divines
what
a
is
among
lawyers
the
probity
of
his
mind
and
the
integrity
of
his
life
create
him
followers
as
being
eloquent
or
loud
advances
others
he
seldom
introduces
the
subject
he
speaks
upon
but
we
are
so
far
gone
in
years
that
he
observes
when
he
is
among
us
an
earnestness
to
have
him
fall
on
some
divine
topic
which
he
always
treats
with
much

let
me
see
them
for
that
i
hated
to
be
stared
at
i
am
the
more
at
ease
in
sir
roger
family
because
it
consists
of
sober
and
staid
persons
for
as
the
knight
is
the
best
master
in
the
world
he
seldom
changes
his
servants
and
as
he
is
beloved
by
all
about
him
his
servants
never
care
for
leaving
him
by
this
means
his
domestics
are
all
in
years
and
grown
old
with
their
master
you
would
take
his
de
for
his
brother
his
butler
is
his
groom
is
one
of
the
gravest
men
that
i
have
ever
seen
and
his
coachman
has
the
looks
of
a
privy
counsellor
you
see
the
goodness
of
the
master
even
in
the
old
and
in
a
grey
pad
that
is
kept
in
the
stable
with
great
care
and
tenderness
out
of
regard
to
his
past
services
though
he
has
been
useless
for
several
years
i
could
not
but
observe
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
the
joy
that
appeared
in
the
countenance
of
these
ancient
domestics
upon
my
arrival
at
his
country
seat
some
of
them
could
not
refrain
from
tears
at
the
sight
of
their
old
master
every
one
of
them
pressed
forward
to
do
something
for
him
and
seemed
discouraged
if
they
were
not
employed
at
the
same
time
the
good
old
knight
with
a
mixture
of
the
father
and
the
master
of
the
family
tempered
the
inquiries
after
his
own
affairs
with
several
kind
questions
relating
to
themselves
this
humanity
and
engages
everybody
to
him
so
that
when
he
is
pleasant
upon
any
of
them
all
his
family
are
in
good
humour
and
none
so
much
as
the
person
whom
he
diverts
himself
with
on
the
contrary
if
he
coughs
or
betrays
any
infirmity
of
old
age
it
is
easy
for
a
to
observe
a
secret
concern
in
the
looks
of
all
his
servants
illustration
one
of
them
press
forward
to
do
something
for
him
my
worthy
friend
has
put
me
under
the
particular
care
of
his
butler
who
is
a
very
prudent
man
and
as
well
as
the
rest
of
his
wonderfully
desirous
of
pleasing
me
because
they
have
often
heard
their
master
talk
of
me
as
of
his
particular
friend
my
chief
companion
when
sir
roger
is
diverting
himself
in
the
woods
or
the
fields
is
a
very
venerable
man
who
is
ever
with
sir
roger
and
has
lived
at
his
house
in
the
nature
of
a
chaplain
above
thirty
years
this
gentleman
is
a
person
of
good
sense
and
some
learning
of
a
very
regular
life
and
obliging
conversation
he
heartily
loves
sir
roger
and
knows
that
he
is
very
much
in
the
old
knight
esteem
so
that
he
lives
in
the
family
rather
as
a
relation
than
a
dependent
i
have
observed
in
several
of
my
papers
that
my
friend
sir
roger
amidst
all
his
good
qualities
is
something
of
an
humorist
and
that
his
virtues
as
well
as
imperfections
are
as
it
were
tinged
by
a
certain
extravagance
which
makes
them
particularly
and
distinguishes
them
from
those
of
other
men
this
cast
of
mind
as
it
is
generally
very
innocent
in
itself
so
it
renders
his
conversation
highly
agreeable
and
more
delightful
than
the
same
degree
of
sense
and
virtue
would
appear
in
their
common
and
ordinary
colours
as
i
was
walking
with
him
last
night
he
asked
me
how
i
liked
the
good
man
whom
i
have
just
now
mentioned
and
without
staying
for
my
answer
told
me
that
he
was
afraid
of
being
insulted
with
latin
and
greek
at
his
own
table
for
which
reason
he
desired
a
particular
friend
of
his
at
the
university
to
find
him
out
a
clergyman
rather
of
plain
sense
than
much
learning
of
a
good
aspect
a
clear
voice
a
sociable
temper
and
if
possible
a
man
that
understood
a
little
of
backgammon
my
friend
says
sir
roger
found
me
out
this
gentleman
who
besides
the
endowments
required
of
him
is
they
tell
me
a
good
scholar
though
he
does
not
show
it
i
have
given
him
the
parsonage
of
the
parish
and
because
i
know
his
value
have
settled
upon
him
a
good
annuity
for
life
if
he
outlives
me
he
shall
find
that
he
was
higher
in
my
esteem
than
perhaps
he
thinks
he
is
he
has
now
been
with
me
thirty
years
and
though
he
does
not
know
i
have
taken
notice
of
it
has
never
in
all
that
time
asked
anything
of
me
for
himself
though
he
is
every
day
soliciting
me
for
something
in
behalf
of
one
or
other
of
my
tenants
his
parishioners
there
has
not
been
a
in
the
parish
since
he
has
lived
among
them
if
any
dispute
arises
they
apply
themselves
to
him
for
the
decision
if
they
do
not
acquiesce
in
his
judgment
which
i
think
never
happened
above
once
or
twice
at
most
they
appeal
to
me
at
his
first
settling
with
me
i
made
him
a
present
of
all
the
good
sermons
which
have
been
printed
in
english
and
only
begged
of
him
that
every
sunday
he
would
pronounce
one
of
them
in
the
pulpit
accordingly
he
has
digested
them
into
such
a
series
that
they
follow
one
another
naturally
and
make
a
continued
system
of
practical
divinity
as
sir
roger
was
going
on
in
his
story
the
gentleman
we
were
talking
of
came
up
to
us
and
upon
the
knight
asking
him
who
preached
for
it
was
saturday
night
told
us
the
bishop
of
asaph
in
the
morning
and
south
in
the
afternoon
he
then
showed
us
his
list
of
preachers
for
the
whole
year
where
i
saw
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
archbishop
tillotson
bishop
saunderson
barrow
calamy
with
several
living
authors
who
have
published
discourses
of
practical
divinity
i
no
sooner
saw
this
venerable
man
in
the
pulpit
but
i
very
much
approved
of
my
friend
insisting
upon
the
qualifications
of
a
good
aspect
and
a
clear
voice
for
i
was
so
charmed
with
the
gracefulness
of
his
figure
and
delivery
as
well
as
with
the
discourses
he
pronounced
that
i
think
i
never
passed
any
time
more
to
my
satisfaction
a
sermon
repeated
after
this
manner
is
like
the
composition
of
a
poet
in
the
mouth
of
a
graceful
actor
i
could
heartily
wish
that
more
of
our
country
clergy
would
follow
this
example
and
instead
of
wasting
their
spirits
in
laborious
compositions
of
their
own
would
endeavour
after
a
handsome
elocution
and
all
those
other
talents
that
are
proper
to
enforce
what
has
been
penned
by
greater
masters
this
would
not
only
be
more
easy
to
themselves
but
more
edifying
to
the
people

the

all
the
reception
manner
of

undisturbed
freedom
and
quiet
which
i
meet
with
here
in
the
country
has
confirmed
me
in
the
opinion
i
always
had
that
the
general
corruption
of
manners
in
servants
is
owing
to
the
conduct
of
masters
the
aspect
of
every
one
in
the
family
carries
so
much
satisfaction
that
it
appears
he
knows
the
happy
lot
which
has
befallen
him
in
being
a
member
of
it
there
is
one
particular
which
i
have
seldom
seen
but
at
sir
roger
it
is
usual
in
all
other
places
that
servants
fly
from
the
parts
of
the
house
through
which
their
master
is
passing
on
the
contrary
here
they
industriously
place
themselves
in
his
way
and
it
is
on
both
sides
as
it
were
understood
as
a
visit
when
the
servants
appear
without
calling
this
proceeds
from
the
humane
and
equal
temper
of
the
man
of
the
house
who
also
perfectly
well
knows
how
to
enjoy
a
great
estate
with
such
economy
as
ever
to
be
much
beforehand
this
makes
his
own
mind
untroubled
and
consequently
unapt
to
vent
peevish
expressions
or
give
passionate
or
inconsistent
orders
to
those
about
him
thus
respect
and
love
go
together
and
a
certain
cheerfulness
in
performance
of
their
duty
is
the
particular
distinction
of
the
lower
part
of
this
family
when
a
servant
is
called
before
his
master
he
does
not
come
with
an
expectation
to
hear
himself
rated
for
some
trivial
fault
threatened
to
be
stripped
or
used
with
any
other
unbecoming
language
which
mean
masters
often
give
to
worthy
servants
but
it
is
often
to
know
what
road
he
took
that
he
came
so
readily
back
according
to
order
whether
he
passed
by
such
a
ground
if
the
old
man
who
rents
it
is
in
good
health
or
whether
he
gave
sir
roger
love
to
him
or
the
like
a
man
who
preserves
a
respect
founded
on
his
benevolence
to
his
dependents
lives
rather
like
a
prince
than
a
master
in
his
family
his
orders
are
received
as
favours
rather
than
duties
and
the
distinction
of
approaching
him
is
part
of
the
reward
for
executing
what
is
commanded
by
him
there
is
another
circumstance
in
which
my
friend
excels
in
his
management
which
is
the
manner
of
rewarding
his
servants
he
has
ever
been
of
opinion
that
giving
his
cast
clothes
to
be
worn
by
valets
has
a
very
ill
effect
upon
little
minds
and
creates
a
silly
sense
of
equality
between
the
parties
in
persons
affected
only
with
outward
things
i
have
heard
him
often
pleasant
on
this
occasion
and
describe
a
young
gentleman
abusing
his
man
in
that
coat
which
a
month
or
two
before
was
the
most
pleasing
distinction
he
was
conscious
of
in
himself
he
would
turn
his
discourse
still
more
pleasantly
upon
the
ladies
bounties
of
this
kind
and
i
have
heard
him
say
he
knew
a
fine
woman
who
distributed
rewards
and
punishments
in
giving
becoming
or
unbecoming
dresses
to
her
maids
but
my
good
friend
is
above
these
little
instances
of
in
bestowing
only
trifles
on
his
servants
a
good
servant
to
him
is
sure
of
having
it
in
his
choice
very
soon
of
being
no
servant
at
all
as
i
before
observed
he
is
so
good
an
husband
and
knows
so
thoroughly
that
the
skill
of
the
purse
is
the
cardinal
virtue
of
this
life
i
say
he
knows
so
well
that
frugality
is
the
support
of
generosity
that
he
can
often
spare
a
large
fine
when
a
tenement
falls
and
give
that
settlement
to
a
good
servant
who
has
a
mind
to
go
into
the
world
or
make
a
stranger
pay
the
fine
to
that
servant
for
his
more
comfortable
maintenance
if
he
stays
in
his
service
a
man
of
honour
and
generosity
considers
it
would
be
miserable
to
himself
to
have
no
will
but
that
of
another
though
it
were
of
the
best
person
breathing
and
for
that
reason
goes
on
as
fast
as
he
is
able
to
put
his
servants
into
independent
livelihoods
the
greatest
part
of
sir
estate
is
tenanted
by
persons
who
have
served
himself
or
his
ancestors
it
was
to
me
extremely
pleasant
to
observe
the
visitants
from
several
parts
to
welcome
his
arrival
in
the
country
and
all
the
difference
that
i
could
take
notice
of
between
the
late
servants
who
came
to
see
him
and
those
who
stayed
in
the
family
was
that
these
latter
were
looked
upon
as
finer
gentlemen
and
better
courtiers
this
manumission
and
placing
them
in
a
way
of
livelihood
i
look
upon
as
only
what
is
due
to
a
good
servant
which
encouragement
will
make
his
successor
be
as
diligent
as
humble
and
as
ready
as
he
was
there
is
something
wonderful
in
the
narrowness
of
those
minds
which
can
be
pleased
and
be
barren
of
bounty
to
those
who
please
them
one
might
on
this
occasion
recount
the
sense
that
great
persons
in
all
ages
have
had
of
the
merit
of
their
dependents
and
the
heroic
services
which
men
have
done
their
masters
in
the
extremity
of
their
fortunes
and
shown
to
their
undone
patrons
that
fortune
was
all
the
difference
between
them
but
as
i
design
this
my
speculation
only
as
a
gentle
admonition
to
thankless
masters
i
shall
not
go
out
of
the
occurrences
of
common
life
but
assert
it
as
a
general
observation
that
i
never
saw
but
in
sir
roger
family
and
one
or
two
more
good
servants
treated
as
they
ought
to
be
sir
roger
kindness
extends
to
their
children
children
and
this
very
morning
he
sent
his
grandson
to
prentice
i
shall
conclude
this
paper
with
an
account
of
a
picture
in
his
gallery
where
there
are
many
which
will
deserve
my
future
observation
at
the
very
upper
end
of
this
handsome
structure
i
saw
the
portraiture
of
two
young
men
standing
in
a
river
the
one
naked
the
other
in
a
livery
the
person
supported
seemed
half
dead
but
still
so
much
alive
as
to
show
in
his
face
exquisite
joy
and
love
towards
the
other
i
thought
the
fainting
figure
resembled
my
friend
sir
roger
and
looking
at
the
butler
who
stood
by
me
for
an
account
of
it
he
informed
me
that
the
person
in
the
livery
was
a
servant
of
sir
roger
who
stood
on
the
shore
while
his
master
was
swimming
and
observing
him
taken
with
some
sudden
illness
and
sink
under
water
jumped
in
and
saved
him
he
told
me
sir
roger
took
off
the
dress
he
was
in
as
soon
as
he
came
home
and
by
a
great
bounty
at
that
time
followed
by
his
favour
ever
since
had
made
him
master
of
that
pretty
seat
which
we
saw
at
a
distance
as
we
came
to
this
house
i
remembered
indeed
sir
roger
said
there
lived
a
very
worthy
gentleman
to
whom
he
was
highly
obliged
without
mentioning
anything
further
upon
my
looking
a
little
dissatisfied
at
some
part
of
the
picture
my
attendant
informed
me
that
it
was
against
sir
roger
will
and
at
the
earnest
request
of
the
gentleman
himself
that
he
was
drawn
in
the
habit
in
which
he
had
saved
his
master

a
particular
favourite
of
all
the

frequently
obliges
with

weaved

then
presents

the
darling
of

sir
roger
was
proceeding
in
the
character
of
him
when
we
saw
him
make
up
to
us
with
two
or
three
in
his
hand
that
he
had
cut
in
sir
roger
woods
as
he
came
through
them
in
his
way
to
the
house
i
was
very
much
pleased
to
observe
on
one
side
the
hearty
and
sincere
welcome
with
which
sir
roger
received
him
and
on
the
other
the
secret
joy
which
his
guest
discovered
at
sight
of
the
good
old
knight
after
the
first
salutes
were
over
will
desired
sir
roger
to
lend
him
one
of
his
servants
to
carry
a
set
of
shuttlecocks
he
had
with
him
in
a
little
box
to
a
lady
that
lived
about
a
mile
off
to
whom
it
seems
he
had
promised
such
a
present
for
above
this
sir
roger
back
was
no
sooner
turned
but
honest
will
began
to
tell
me
of
a
large
cock
pheasant
that
he
had
sprung
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
woods
with
two
or
three
other
adventures
of
the
same
nature
odd
and
uncommon
characters
are
the
game
that
i
look
for
and
most
delight
in
for
which
reason
i
was
as
much
pleased
with
the
novelty
of
the
person
that
talked
to
me
as
he
could
be
for
his
life
with
the
springing
of
a
pheasant
and
therefore
listened
to
him
with
more
than
ordinary
attention
in
the
midst
of
his
discourse
the
bell
rung
to
dinner
where
the
gentleman
i
have
been
speaking
of
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
huge
jack
he
had
caught
served
up
for
the
first
dish
in
a
most
sumptuous
manner
upon
our
sitting
down
to
it
he
gave
us
a
long
account
how
he
had
hooked
it
played
with
it
foiled
it
and
at
length
drew
it
out
upon
the
bank
with
several
other
particulars
that
lasted
all
the
first
course
a
dish
of
that
came
afterwards
furnished
conversation
for
the
rest
of
the
dinner
which
concluded
with
a
late
invention
of
will
for
improving
the
upon
withdrawing
into
my
room
after
dinner
i
was
secretly
touched
with
compassion
towards
the
honest
gentleman
that
had
dined
with
us
and
could
not
but
consider
with
a
great
deal
of
concern
how
so
good
an
heart
and
such
busy
hands
were
wholly
employed
in
trifles
that
so
much
humanity
should
be
so
little
beneficial
to
others
and
so
much
industry
so
little
advantageous
to
himself
the
same
temper
of
mind
and
application
to
affairs
might
have
recommended
him
to
the
public
esteem
and
have
raised
his
fortune
in
another
station
of
life
what
good
to
his
country
or
himself
might
not
a
trader
or
merchant
have
done
with
such
useful
though
ordinary
qualifications
will
wimble
is
the
case
of
many
a
younger
brother
of
a
great
family
who
had
rather
see
their
children
starve
like
gentlemen
than
thrive
in
a
trade
or
profession
that
is
beneath
their
quality
this
humour
fills
several
parts
of
europe
with
pride
and
beggary
it
is
the
happiness
of
a
trading
nation
like
ours
that
the
younger
sons
though
incapable
of
any
liberal
art
or
profession
may
be
placed
in
such
a
way
of
life
as
may
perhaps
enable
them
to
vie
with
the
best
of
their
family
accordingly
we
find
several
citizens
that
were
launched
into
the
world
with
narrow
fortunes
rising
by
an
honest
industry
to
greater
estates
than
those
of
their
elder
brothers
it
is
not
improbable
but
will
was
formerly
tried
at
divinity
law
or
physic
and
that
finding
his
genius
did
not
lie
that
way
his
parents
gave
him
up
at
length
to
his
own
inventions
but
certainly
however
improper
he
might
have
been
for
studies
of
a
higher
nature
he
was
perfectly
well
turned
for
the
occupations
of
trade
and
commerce
as
i
think
this
is
a
point
which
can
not
be

much
inculcated

ii
ver
of
plain
good
sense
untutor
in
the
schools
i
was
this
morning
walking
in
the
gallery
when
sir
roger
entered
at
the
end
opposite
to
me
and
advancing
towards
me
said
he
was
glad
to
meet
me
among
his
relations
the
de
coverleys
and
hoped
i
liked
the
conversation
of
so
much
good
company
who
were
as
silent
as
myself
i
knew
he
alluded
to
the
pictures
and
as
he
is
a
gentleman
who
does
not
a
little
value
himself
upon
his
ancient
descent
i
expected
he
would
give
me
some
account
of
them
we
were
now
arrived
at
the
upper
end
of
the
gallery
when
the
knight
faced
towards
one
of
the
pictures
and
as
we
stood
before
it
he
entered
into
the
matter
after
his
blunt
way
of
saying
things
as
they
occur
to
his
imagination
without
regular
introduction
or
care
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
chain
of
thought
it
is
said
he
worth
while
to
consider
the
force
of
dress
and
how
the
persons
of
one
age
differ
from
those
of
another
merely
by
that
only
one
may
observe
also
that
the
general
fashion
of
one
age
has
been
followed
by
one
particular
set
of
people
in
another
and
by
them
preserved
from
one
generation
to
another
thus
the
vast
jetting
coat
and
small
bonnet
which
was
the
habit
in
harry
the
seventh
time
is
kept
on
in
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
not
without
a
good
and
politic
view
because
they
look
a
foot
taller
and
a
foot
and
an
half
broader
besides
that
the
cap
leaves
the
face
expanded
and
consequently
more
terrible
and
fitter
to
stand
at
the
entrances
of
palaces
this
predecessor
of
ours
you
see
is
dressed
after
this
manner
and
his
cheeks
would
be
no
larger
than
mine
were
he
in
a
hat
as
i
am
he
was
the
last
man
that
won
a
prize
in
the
which
is
now
a
common
street
before
whitehall
you
see
the
broken
lance
that
lies
there
by
his
right
foot
he
shivered
that
lance
of
his
adversary
all
to
pieces
and
bearing
himself
look
you
sir
in
this
manner
at
the
same
time
he
came
within
the
target
of
the
gentleman
who
rode
against
him
and
taking
him
with
incredible
force
before
him
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
he
in
that
manner
rid
the
tournament
over
with
an
air
that
showed
he
did
it
rather
to
perform
the
rule
of
the
lists
than
expose
his
enemy
however
it
appeared
he
knew
how
to
make
use
of
a
victory
and
with
a
gentle
trot
he
marched
up
to
a
gallery
where
their
mistress
sat
for
they
were
rivals
and
let
him
down
with
laudable
courtesy
and
pardonable
insolence
i
do
know
but
it
might
be
exactly
where
the
is
now
you
are
to
know
this
my
ancestor
was
not
only
of
a
military
genius
but
fit
also
for
the
arts
of
peace
for
he
played
on
the
as
well
as
any
gentleman
at
court
you
see
where
his
viol
hangs
by
his
sword
the
action
at
the
you
may
be
sure
won
the
fair
lady
who
was
a
maid
of
honour
and
the
greatest
beauty
of
her
time
here
she
stands
the
next
picture
you
see
sir
my
has
on
the
petticoat
except
that
the
modern
is
gathered
at
the
waist
my
grandmother
appears
as
if
she
stood
in
a
large
drum
whereas
the
ladies
now
walk
as
if
they
were
in
a
for
all
this
lady
was
bred
at
court
she
became
an
excellent
country
wife
she
brought
ten
children
and
when
i
show
you
the
library
you
shall
see
in
her
own
hand
allowing
for
the
difference
of
the
language
the
best

both
for

a
if
you
please
to
fall
back
a
little
because
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
three
next
pictures
at
one
view
these
are
three
sisters
she
on
the
right
hand
who
is
so
beautiful
died
a
maid
the
next
to
her
still
handsomer
had
the
same
fate
against
her
will
this
homely
thing
in
the
middle
had
both
their
portions
added
to
her
own
and
was
stolen
by
a
neighbouring
gentleman
a
man
of
stratagem
and
resolution
for
he
poisoned
three
mastiffs
to
come
at
her
and
knocked
down
two
in
carrying
her
off
misfortunes
happen
in
all
families
the
theft
of
this
romp
and
so
much
money
was
no
great
matter
to
our
estate
but
the
next
heir
that
possessed
it
was
this
soft
gentleman
whom
you
see
there
observe
the
small
buttons
the
little
boots
the
laces
the
slashes
about
his
clothes
and
above
all
the
posture
he
is
drawn
in
which
to
be
sure
was
his
own
choosing
you
see
he
sits
with
one
hand
on
a
desk
writing
and
looking
as
it
were
another
way
like
an
easy
writer
or
a
sonneteer
he
was
one
of
those
that
had
too
much
wit
to
know
how
to
live
in
the
world
he
was
a
man
of
no
justice
but
great
good
manners
he
ruined
everybody
that
had
anything
to
do
with
him
but
never
said
a
rude
thing
in
his
life
the
most
indolent
person
in
the
world
he
would
sign
a
deed
that
passed
away
half
his
estate
with
his
gloves
on
but
would
not
put
on
his
hat
before
a
lady
if
it
were
to
save
his
country
he
is
said
to
be
the
first
that
made
love
by
squeezing
the
hand
he
left
the
estate
with
ten
thousand
pounds
debt
upon
it
but
however
by
all
hands
i
have
been
informed
that
he
was
every
way
the
finest
gentleman
in
the
world
that
debt
lay
heavy
on
our
house
for
one
generation
but
it
was
retrieved
by
a
gift
from
that
honest
man
you
see
there
a
citizen
of
our
name
but
nothing
at
all
akin
to
us
i
know
sir
andrew
freeport
has
said
behind
my
back
that
this
man
was
descended
from
one
of
the
ten
children
of
the
maid
of
honour
i
showed
you
above
but
it
was
never
made
out
we
winked
at
the
thing
indeed
because
money
was
wanting
at
that
time
here
i
saw
my
friend
a
little
embarrassed
and
turned
my
face
to
the
next
portraiture
sir
roger
went
on
with
his
account
of
the
gallery
in
the
following
manner
this
man
pointing
to
him
i
looked
at
i
take
to
be
the
honour
of
our
house
sir
humphrey
de
coverley
he
was
in
his
dealings
as
punctual
as
a
tradesman
and
as
generous
as
a
gentleman
he
would
have
thought
himself
as
much
undone
by
breaking
his
word
as
if
it
were
to
be
followed
by
bankruptcy
he
served
his
country
as
knight
of
this
shire
to
his
dying
day
he
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
maintain
an
integrity
in
his
words
and
actions
even
in
things
that
regarded
the
offices
which
were
incumbent
upon
him
in
the
care
of
his
own
affairs
and
relations
of
life
and
therefore
dreaded
though
he
had
great
talents
to
go
into
employments
of
state
where
he
must
be
exposed
to
the
snares
of
ambition
innocence
of
life
and
great
ability
were
the
distinguishing
parts
of
his
character
the
latter
he
had
often
observed
had
led
to
the
destruction
of
the
former
and
used
frequently
to
lament
that
great
and
good
had
not
the
same
signification
he
was
an
excellent
husbandman
but
had
resolved
not
to
exceed
such
a
degree
of
wealth
all
above
it
he
bestowed
in
secret
bounties
many
years
after
the
sum
he
aimed
at
for
his
own
use
was
attained
yet
he
did
not
slacken
his
industry
but
to
a
decent
old
age
spent
the
life
and
fortune
which
was
superfluous
to
himself
in
the
service
of
his
friends
and
neighbours
here
we
were
called
to
dinner
and
sir
roger
ended
the
discourse
of
this
gentleman
by
telling
me
as
we
followed
the
servant
that
this
his
ancestor
was
a
brave
man
and
narrowly
escaped
being
killed
in
the
civil
wars
for
said
he
he
was
sent
out
of
the
field
upon
a
private
message
the
day
before
the
battle
of
worcester
the
whim
of
narrowly
escaping
by
having
been
within
a
day
of
danger
with
other
matters
above
mentioned
mixed
with
good

left

at
a

distance
from
sir

house
among
the
ruins
of
an
old
abbey
there
is
a
long
walk
of
aged
elms

are
shot
up

very
high
that
when

passes

them

i
am
very
much
delighted
with
this
sort
of

which
i
consider
as
a
kind
of
natural
prayer
to
that
being

his

who
in

call

i
like

the

lies

i
have
been
told
in

no

the
chaplain
my
good
friend
the
butler
desired
me
with
a
very
grave
face
not
to
venture
myself
in
it
after
sunset
for
that
one
of
the
footmen
had
been
almost
frighted
out
of
his
wits
by
a
spirit
that
appeared
to
him
in
the
shape
of
a
black
horse
without
an
head
to
which
he
added
that
about
a
month
ago
one
of
the
maids
coming
home
late
that
way
with
a
pail
of
milk
upon
her
head
heard
such
a
rustling
among
the
bushes
that
she
let
it
fall
i
was
taking
a
walk
in
this
place
last
night
between
the
hours
of
nine
and
ten
and
could
not
but
fancy
it

of
the
most
proper
scenes
in
the
world
for
a
ghost
to
appear
in
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
are
scattered
up
and
down
on
every
side
and
half
covered
with
ivy
and
elder
bushes
the
harbours
of
several
solitary
birds
which
seldom
make
their
appearance
till
the
dusk
of
the
evening
the
place
was
formerly
a
churchyard
and
has
still
several
marks
in
it
of
graves
and
there
is
such
an
echo
among
the
old
ruins
and
vaults
that
if
you
stamp
but
a
little
louder
than
ordinary
you
hear
the
sound
repeated
at
the
same
time
the
walk
of
elms
with
the
croaking
of
the
ravens
which
from
time
to
time
are
heard
from
the
tops
of
them
looks
exceeding
solemn
and
venerable
these
objects
naturally
raise
seriousness
and
attention
and
when
night
heightens
the
awfulness
of
the
place
and
pours
out
her
supernumerary
horrors
upon
everything
in
it
i
do
not
at
all
wonder
that
weak
minds
fill
it
with
spectres
and
apparitions
locke
in
his
chapter
of
the
association
of
ideas
has
very
curious
remarks
to
show
how
by
the
prejudice
of
education
one
idea
often
introduces
into
the
mind
a
whole
set
that
bear
no
resemblance
to
one
another
in
the
nature
of
things
among
several
examples
of
this
kind
he
produces
the
following
instance
the
ideas
of
goblins
and
sprites
have
really
no
more
to
do
with
darkness
than
light
yet
let
but
a
foolish
maid
inculcate
these
often
on
the
mind
of
a
child
and
raise
them
there
together
possibly
he
shall
never
be
able
to
separate
them
again
so
long
as
he
lives
but
darkness
shall
ever
afterwards
bring
with
it
those
frightful
ideas
and
they
shall
be
so
joined
that
he
can
no
more
bear
the
one
than
the
other
as
i
was
walking
in
this
solitude
where
the
dusk
of
the
evening
conspired
with
so
many
other
occasions
of
terror
i
observed
a
cow
grazing
not
far
from
me
which
an
imagination
that
was
apt
to
startle
might
easily
have
construed
into
a
black
horse
without
an
head
and
i
dare
say
the
poor
footman
lost
his
wits
upon
some
such
trivial
occasion
my
friend
sir
roger
has
often
told
me
with
a
good
deal
of
mirth
that
at
his
first
coming
to
his
estate
he
found
three
parts
of
his
house
altogether
useless
that
the
best
room
in
it
had
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
and
by
that
means
was
locked
up
that
noises
had
been
heard
in
his
long
gallery
so
that
he
could
not
get
a
servant
to
enter
it
after
eight
at
night
that
the
door
of
one
of
the
chambers
was
nailed
up
because
there
went
a
story
in
the
family
that
a
butler
had
formerly
hanged
himself
in
it
and
that
his
mother
who
lived
to
a
great
age
had
shut
up
half
the
rooms
in
the
house
in
which
either
her
husband
a
son
or
daughter
had
died
the
knight
seeing
his
habitation
reduced
to
so
small
a
compass
and
himself
in
a
manner
shut
out
of
his
own
house
upon
the
death
of
his
mother
ordered
all
the
apartments
to
be
flung
open
and
exorcised
by
his
chaplain
who
lay
in
every
room
one
after
another
and
by
that
means
dissipated
the
fears
which
had
so
long
reigned
in
the
family
i
should
not
have
been
thus
particular
upon
these
ridiculous
horrors
did
not
i
find
them
so
very
much
prevail
in
all
parts
of
the
country
at
the
same
time
i
think
a
person
who
is
thus
terrified
with
the
imagination
of
ghosts
and
spectres
much
more
reasonable
than
one
who
contrary
to
the
reports
of
all
historians
sacred
and
profane
ancient
and
modern
and
to
the
traditions
of
all
nations
thinks
the
appearance
of
spirits
fabulous
and
groundless
could
not
i
give
myself
up
to
this
general
testimony
of
mankind
i
should
to
the
relations
of
particular
persons
who
are
now
living
and
whom
i
can
not
distrust
in
other
matters
of
fact
i
might
here
add
that
not
only
the
historians
to
whom
we
may
join
the
poets
but
likewise
the
philosophers
of
antiquity
have
favoured
this
opinion
lucretius
himself
though
by
the
course
of
his
philosophy
he
was
obliged
to
maintain
that
the
soul
did
not
exist
separate
from
the
body
makes
no
doubt
of
the
reality
of
apparitions
and
that
men
have
often
appeared
after
their
death
this
i
think
very
remarkable
he
was
so
pressed
with
the
matter
of
fact
which
he
could
not
have
the
confidence
to
deny
that
he
was
forced
to
account
for
it
by
one
of
the
most
absurd
unphilosophical
notions
that
was
ever
started
he
tells
us
that
the
surfaces
of
all
bodies
are
perpetually
flying
off
from
their
respective
bodies
one
after
another
and
that
these
surfaces
or
thin
cases
that
included
each
other
whilst
they
were
joined
in
the
body
like
the
coats
of
an
onion
are
sometimes
seen
entire
when
they
are
separated
from
it
by
which
means
we
often
behold
the
shapes
and
shadows
of
persons
who
are
either
dead
or
absent
i
shall
dismiss
this
paper
with
a
story
out
of
josephus
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
the
story
itself
as
for
the
moral
reflections
with
which
the
author
concludes
it
and
which
i
shall
here
set
down
in
his
own
words
glaphyra
the
daughter
of
king
archelaus
after
the
death
of
her
two
first
husbands
being
married
to
a
third
who
was
brother
to
her
first
husband
and
so
passionately
in
love
with
her
that
he
turned
off
his
former
wife
to
make
room
for
this
marriage
had
a
very
odd
kind
of
dream
she
fancied
that
she
saw
her
first
husband
coming
towards
her
and
that
she
embraced
him
with
great
tenderness
when
in
the
midst
of
the
pleasure
which
she
expressed
at
the
sight
of
him
he
reproached
her
after
the
following
manner
says
he
hast
made
good
the
old
saying
that
women
are
not
to
be
trusted
was
not
i
the
husband
of
thy
virginity
have
i
not
children
by
thee
how
couldst
thou
forget
our
loves
so
far
as
to
enter
into
a
second
marriage
and
after
that
into
a
third
nay
to
take
for
thy
husband
a
man
who
has
so
shamefully
crept
into
the
bed
of
his
brother
however
for
the
sake
of
our
passed
loves
i
shall
free
thee
from
thy
present
reproach
and
make
thee
mine
for
ever
glaphyra
told
this
dream
to
several
women
of
her
acquaintance
and
died
soon
after
i
thought
this
story
might
not
be
impertinent
in
this
place
wherein
i
speak
of
those
kings
besides
that
the
example
deserves
to
be
taken
notice
of
as
it
contains
a
most
certain
proof
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
of
divine
providence
if
any
man
thinks
these
facts
incredible
let
him
enjoy
his
own
opinion
to
himself
but
let
him
not
endeavour
to
disturb
the
belief
of
others
who
by
instances
of
this
nature
are
excited
to
the
study
of
virtue

were

clears
away
the
rust
of
the
whole
week
not
only
as
it
refreshes
in
their
minds
the
notions
of
religion
but
as
it
puts
both
the
sexes
upon
appearing
in
their
most
agreeable
forms
and
exerting
all
such
qualities
as
are
apt
to
give
them
a
figure
in
the
eye
of
the
village
a
country
fellow
distinguishes
himself
as
much
in
the
churchyard
as
a
citizen
does

whole

generally
discussed
in
that
place
either
after
sermon
or
before
the
bell
rings
my
friend
sir
roger
being
a
good
churchman
has
beautified
the
inside
of
his
church
with
several
texts
of
his
own
choosing
he
has
likewise
given
a
handsome
pulpit
cloth
and
railed
in
the
at
his
own
expense
he
has
often
told
me
that
at
his
coming
to
his
estate
he
found
his
parishioners
very
irregular
and
that
in
order
to
make
them
kneel
and
join
in
the
responses
he
gave
every
one
of
them
a
hassock
and
a
and
at
the
same
time
employed
an
itinerant
who
goes
about
the
country
for
that
purpose
to
instruct
them
rightly
in
the
tunes
of
the
psalms
upon
which
they
now
very
much
value
themselves
and
indeed
outdo
most
of
the
country
churches
that
i
have
ever
heard
as
sir
roger
is
landlord
to
the
whole
congregation
he
keeps
them
in
very
good
order
and
will
suffer
nobody
to
sleep
in
it
besides
himself
for
if
by
chance
he
has
been
surprised
into
a
short
nap
at
sermon
upon
recovering
out
of
it
he
stands
up
and
looks
about
him
and
if
he
sees
anybody
else
nodding
either
wakes
them
himself
or
sends
his
servants
to
them
several
other
of
the
old
knight
particularities
break
out
upon
these
occasions
sometimes
he
will
be
lengthening
out
a
verse
in
the
singing
psalms
half
a
minute
after
the
rest
of
the
congregation
have
done
with
it
sometimes
when
he
is
pleased
with
the
matter
of
his
devotion
he
pronounces
amen
three
or
four
times
to
the
same
prayer
and
sometimes
stands
up
when
everybody
else
is
upon
their
knees
to
count
the
congregation
or
see
if
any
of
his
tenants
are
missing
i
was
yesterday
very
much
surprised
to
hear
my
old
friend
in
the
midst
of
the
service
calling
out
to
one
john
matthews
to
mind
what
he
was
about
and
not
disturb
the
congregation
this
john
matthews
it
seems
is
remarkable
for
being
an
idle
fellow
and
at
that
time
was
kicking
his
heels
for
his
diversion
this
authority
of
the
knight
though
exerted
in
that
odd
manner
which
accompanies
him
in
all
circumstances
of
life
has
a
very
good
effect
upon
the
parish
who
are
not
polite
enough
to
see
anything
ridiculous
in
his
behaviour
besides
that
the
general
good
sense
and
worthiness
of
his
character
makes
his
friends
observe
these
little
singularities
as
foils
that
rather
set
off
than
blemish
his
good
qualities
as
soon
as
the
sermon
is
finished
nobody
presumes
to
stir
till
sir
roger
is
gone
out
of
the
church
the
knight
walks
down
from
his
seat
in
the
chancel
between
a
double
row
of
his
tenants
that
stand
bowing
to
him
on
each
side
and
every
now
and
then
inquires
how
such
an
one
wife
or
mother
or
son
or
father
do
whom
he
does
not
see
at
church
which
is
understood
as
a
secret
reprimand
to
the
person
that
is
absent
the
chaplain
has
often
told
me
that
upon
a
catechising
day
when
sir
roger
has
been
pleased
with
a
boy
that
answers
well
he
has
ordered
a
bible
to
be
given
him
next
day
for
his
encouragement
and
sometimes
accompanies
it
with
a
flitch
of
bacon
to
his
mother
sir
roger
has
likewise
added
five
pounds
a
year
to
the
clerk
place
and
that
he
may
encourage
the
young
fellows
to
make
themselves
perfect
in
the
church
service
has
promised
upon
the
death
of
the
present
incumbent
who
is
very
old
to
bestow
it
according
to
merit
the
fair
understanding
between
sir
roger
and
his
chaplain
and
their
mutual
concurrence
in
doing
good
is
the
more
remarkable
because
the
very
next
village
is
famous
for
the
differences
and
contentions
that
arise
between
the
parson
and
the
squire
who
live
in
a
perpetual
state
of
war
the
parson
is
always
preaching
at
the
squire
and
the
squire
to
be
revenged
on
the
parson
never
comes
to
church
the
squire
has
made
all
his
tenants
atheists
and
while
the
parson
instructs
them
every
sunday
in
the
dignity
of
his
order
and
insinuates
to
them
in
almost
every
sermon
that
he
is
a
better
man
than
his
patron
in
short
matters
are
come
to
such
an
extremity
that
the
squire
has
not
said
his
prayers
either
in
public
or
private
this
and
that
the
parson
threatens
him
if
he
does
not
mend
his
manners
to
pray
for
him
in
the
face
of
the
whole
congregation
feuds
of
this
nature
though
too
frequent
in
the
country
are
very
fatal
to
the
ordinary
people
who
are
so
used
to
be
dazzled
with
riches
that
they
pay
as
much
deference
to
the
understanding
of
a
man
of
an
estate
as
of
a
man
of
learning
and
are
very
hardly
brought
to
regard
any
truth
how
important
soever
it
may
be
that
is
preached
to
them
when
they
know
there
are
several
men
of

most
of

it
may
be
remembered
that
i
mentioned
a
great
affliction
which
my
friend
sir
roger
had
met
with
in
his
youth
which
was
no
less
than
a
disappointment
in
love
it
happened
this
evening
that
we
fell
into
a
very
pleasing
walk
at
a
distance
from
his
house
as
soon
as
we
came
into
it
it
is
quoth
the
good
old
man
looking
round
him
with
a
smile
very
hard
that
any
part
of
my
land
should
be
settled
upon
one
who
has
used
me
so
ill
as
the
perverse
widow
did
and
yet
i
am
sure
i
could
not
see
a
sprig
of
any
bough
of
this
whole
walk
of
trees
but
i
should
reflect
upon
her
and
her
severity
she
has
certainly
the
finest
hand
of
any
woman
in
the
world
you
are
to
know
this
was
the
place
wherein
i
used
to
muse
upon
her
and
by
that
custom
i
can
never
come
into
it
but
the
same
tender
sentiments
revive
in
my
mind
as
if
i
had
actually
walked
with
that
beautiful
creature
under
these
shades
i
have
been
fool
enough
to
carve
her
name
on
the
bark
of
several
of
these
trees
so
unhappy
is
the
condition
of
men
in
love
to
attempt
the
removing
of
their
passions
by
the
methods
which
serve
only
to
imprint
it
deeper
she
has
certainly
the
finest
hand
of
any
woman
in
the
world
here
followed
a
profound
silence
and
i
was
not
displeased
to
observe
my
friend
falling
so
naturally
into
a
discourse
which
i
had
ever
before
taken
notice
he
industriously
avoided
after
a
very
long
pause
he
entered
upon
an
account
of
this
great
circumstance
in
his
life
with
an
air
which
i
thought
raised
my
idea
of
him
above
what
i
had
ever
had
before
and
gave
me
the
picture
of
that
cheerful
mind
of
his
before
it
received
that
stroke
which
has
ever
since
affected
his
words
and
actions
but
he
went
on
as
follows
i
came
to
my
estate
in
my
year
and
resolved
to
follow
the
steps
of
the
most
worthy
of
my
ancestors
who
have
inhabited
this
spot
of
earth
before
me
in
all
the
methods
of
hospitality
and
good
neighbourhood
for
the
sake
of
my
fame
and
in
country
sports
and
recreations
for
the
sake
of
my
health
in
my
year
i
was
obliged
to
serve
as
sheriff
of
the
county
and
in
my
servants
officers
and
whole
equipage
indulged
the
pleasure
of
a
young
man
who
did
not
think
ill
of
his
own
person
in
taking
that
public
occasion
of
showing
my
figure
and
behaviour
to
advantage

of

can
assure
you
i
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
kind
looks
and
glances
i
had
from
all
the
balconies
and
windows
as
i
rode
to
the
hall
where
the
assizes
were
held
but
when
i
came
there
a
beautiful
creature
in
a
widow
habit
sat
in
court
to
hear
the
event
of
a
cause
concerning
her
dower
this
commanding
creature
who
was
born
for
the
destruction
of
all
who
behold
her
put
on
such
a
resignation
in
her
countenance
and
bore
the
whispers
of
all
around
the
court
with
such
a
pretty
uneasiness
i
warrant
you
and
then
recovered
herself
from
one
eye
to
another
till
she
was
perfectly
confused
by
meeting
something
so
wistful
in
all
she
encountered
that
at
last
with
a
murrain
to
her
she
cast
her
bewitching
eye
upon
me
i
no
sooner
met
it
but
i
bowed
like
a
great
surprised
booby
and
knowing
her
cause
to
be
the
first
which
came
on
i
cried
like
a
captivated
calf
as
i
was
way
for
the
defendant
witnesses
this
sudden
partiality
made
all
the
county
immediately
see
the
sheriff
was
also
become
a
slave
to
the
fine
widow
during
the
time
her
cause
was
upon
trial
she
behaved
herself
i
warrant
you
with
such
a
deep
attention
to
her
business
took
opportunities
to
have
little
billets
handed
to
her
counsel
then
would
be
in
such
a
pretty
confusion
occasioned
you
must
know
by
acting
before
so
much
company
that
not
only
i
but
the
whole
court
was
prejudiced
in
her
favour
and
all
that
the
next
heir
to
her
husband
had
to
urge
was
thought
so
groundless
and
frivolous
that
when
it
came
to
her
counsel
to
reply
there
was
not
half
so
much
said
as
every
one
besides
in
the
court
thought
he
could
have
urged
to
her
advantage
you
must
understand
sir
this
perverse
woman
is
one
of
those
unaccountable
creatures
that
secretly
rejoice
in
the
admiration
of
men
but
indulge
themselves
in
no
further
consequences
hence
it
is
that
she
has
ever
had
a
train
of
admirers
and
she
removes
from
her
slaves
in
town
to
those
in
the
country
according
to
the
seasons
of
the
year
she
is
a
reading
lady
and
far
gone
in
the
pleasures
of
friendship
she
is
always
accompanied
by
a
confidant
who
is
witness
to
her
daily
protestations
against
our
sex
and
consequently
a
bar
to
her
first
steps
towards
love
upon
the
strength
of
her
own
maxims
and
declarations
illustration
she
began
a
discourse
to
me
concerning
love
and
honour
however
i
must
needs
say
this
accomplished
mistress
of
mine
has
distinguished
me
above
the
rest
and
has
been
known
to
declare
sir
roger
de
coverley
was
the
tamest
and
most
humane
of
all
the
brutes
in
the
country
i
was
told
she
said
so
by
one
who
thought
he
rallied
me
but
upon
the
strength
of
this
slender
encouragement
of
being
thought
least
detestable
i
made
new
liveries
my
sent
them
all
to
town
to
be
bitted
and
taught
to
throw
their
legs
well
and
move
all
together
before
i
pretended
to
cross
the
country
and
wait
upon
her
as
soon
as
i
thought
my
retinue
suitable
to
the
character
of
my
fortune
and
youth
i
set
out
from
hence
to
make
my
addresses
the
particular
skill
of
this
lady
has
ever
been
to
inflame
your
wishes
and
yet
command
respect
to
make
her
mistress
of
this
art
she
has
a
greater
share
of
knowledge
wit
and
good
sense
than
is
usual
even
among
men
of
merit
then
she
is
beautiful
beyond
the
race
of
women
if
you
will
not
let
her
go
on
with
a
certain
artifice
with
her
eyes
and
the
skill
of
beauty
she
will
arm
herself
with
her
real
charms
and
strike
you
with
admiration
instead
of
desire
it
is
certain
that
if
you
were
to
behold
the
whole
woman
there
is
that
dignity
in
her
aspect
that
composure
in
her
motion
that
complacency
in
her
manner
that
if
her
form
makes
you
hope
her
merit
makes
you
fear
but
then
again
she
is
such
a
desperate
scholar
that
no
country
gentleman
can
approach
her
without
being
a
jest
as
i
was
going
to
tell
you
when
i
came
to
her
house
i
was
admitted
to
her
presence
with
great
civility
at
the
same
time
she
placed
herself
to
be
first
seen
by
me
in
such
an
attitude
as
i
think
you
call
the
posture
of
a
picture
that
she
discovered
new
charms
and
i
at
last
came
towards
her
with
such
an
awe
as
made
me
speechless
this
she
no
sooner
observed
but
she
made
her
advantage
of
it
and
began
a
discourse
to
me
concerning
love
and
honour
as
they
both
are
followed
by
pretenders
and
the
real
votaries
to
them
when
she
discussed
these
points
in
a
discourse
which
i
verily
believe
was
as
learned
as
the
best
philosopher
in
europe
could
possibly
make
she
asked
me
whether
she
was
so
happy
as
to
fall
in
with
my
sentiments
on
these
important
particulars
her
confidant
sat
by
her
and
upon
my
being
in
the
last
confusion
and
silence
this
malicious
of
hers
turning
to
her
says
am
very
glad
to
observe
sir
roger
pauses
upon
this
subject
and
seems
resolved
to
deliver
all
his
sentiments
upon
the
matter
when
he
pleases
to
speak
they
both
kept
their
countenances
and
after
i
had
sat
half
an
hour
meditating
how
to
behave
before
such
profound
casuists
i
rose
up
and
took
my
leave
chance
has
since
that
time
thrown
me
very
often
in
her
way
and
she
as
often
has
directed
a
discourse
to
me
which
i
do
not
understand
this
barbarity
has
kept
me
ever
at
a
distance
from
the
most
beautiful
object
my
eyes
ever
beheld
it
is
thus
also
she
deals
with
all
mankind
and
you
must
make
love
to
her
as
you
would
conquer
the
sphinx
by
posing
her
but
were
she
like
other
women
and
that
there
were
any
talking
to
her
how
constant
must
the
pleasure
of
that
man
be
who
would
converse
with
a
creature
but
after
all
you
may
be
sure
her
heart
is
fixed
on
some
one
or
other
and
yet
i
have
been
credibly
informed
but
who
can
believe
half
that
is
said
after
she
had
done
speaking
to
me
she
put
her
hand
to
her
bosom
and
adjusted
her
tucker
then
she
cast
her
eyes
a
little
down
upon
my
beholding
her
too
earnestly
they
say
she
sings
excellently
her
voice
in
her
ordinary
speech
has
something
in
it
inexpressibly
sweet
you
must
know
i
dined
with
her
at
a
public
table
the
day
after
i
first
saw
her
and
she
helped
me
to
some
tansy
in
the
eye
of
all
the
gentlemen
in
the
country
she
has
certainly
the
finest
hand
of
any
woman
in
the
world
i
can
assure
you
sir
were
you
to
behold
her
you
would
be
in
the
same
condition
for
as
her
speech
is
music
her
form
is
angelic
but
i
find
i
grow
irregular
while
i
am
talking
of
her
but
indeed
it
would
be
stupidity
to
be
unconcerned
at
such
perfection
oh
the
excellent
creature
she
is
as
inimitable
to
all
women
as
she
is
inaccessible
to
all
men
i
found
my
friend
begin
to
rave
and
insensibly
led
him
towards
the
house
that
we
might
be
joined
by
some
other
company
and
am
convinced
that
the
widow
is
the
secret
cause
of
all
that
inconsistency
which
appears
in
some
parts
of
my
friend
discourse
though
he
has
so
much
command
of
himself
as
not
directly
to
mention
her
yet

a
healthy
body
and
a
mind
at
ease
bodily
labour
is
of
two
kinds
either
that
which
a
man
submits
to
for
his
livelihood
or
that
which
he
undergoes
for
his
pleasure
the
latter
of
them
generally
changes
the
name
of
labour
for
that
of
exercise
but
differs
only
from
ordinary
labour
as
it
rises
from
another
motive
a
country
life
abounds
in
both
these
kinds
of
labour
and
for
that
reason
gives
a
man
a
greater
stock
of
health
and
consequently
a
more
perfect
enjoyment
of
himself
than
any
other
way
of
life
i
consider
the
body
as
a
system
of
tubes
and
glands
or
to
use
a
more
rustic
phrase
a
bundle
of
pipes
and
strainers
fitted
to
one
another
after
so
wonderful
a
manner
as
to
make
a
proper
engine
for
the
soul
to
work
with
this
description
does
not
only
comprehend
the
bowels
bones
tendons
veins
nerves
and
arteries
but
every
muscle
and
every
ligature
which
is
a
composition
of
fibres
that
are
so
many
imperceptible
tubes
or
pipes
interwoven
on
all
sides
with
invisible
glands
or
strainers
this
general
idea
of
a
human
body
without
considering
it
in
its
niceties
of
anatomy
lets
us
see
how
absolutely
necessary
labour
is
for
the
right
preservation
of
it
there
must
be
frequent
motions
and
agitations
to
mix
digest
and
separate
the
juices
contained
in
it
as
well
as
to
clear
and
cleanse
that
infinitude
of
pipes
and
strainers
of
which
it
is
composed
and
to
give
their
solid
parts
a
more
firm
and
lasting
tone
labour
or
exercise
ferments
the
humours
casts
them
into
their
proper
channels
throws
off
redundancies
and
helps
nature
in
those
secret
distributions
without
which
the
body
can
not
subsist
in
its
vigour
nor
the
soul
act
with
cheerfulness
i
might
here
mention
the
effects
which
this
has
upon
all
the
faculties
of
the
mind
by
keeping
the
understanding
clear
the
imagination
untroubled
and
refining
those
spirits
that
are
necessary
for
the
proper
exertion
of
our
intellectual
faculties
during
the
present
laws
of
union
between
soul
and
body
it
is
to
a
neglect
in
this
particular
that
we
must
ascribe
the
spleen
which
is
so
frequent
in
men
of
studious
and
sedentary
tempers
as
well
as
the
vapours
to
which
those
of
the
other
sex
are
so
often
subject
had
not
exercise
been
absolutely
necessary
for
our
nature
would
not
have
made
the
body
so
proper
for
it
by
giving
such
an
activity
to
the
limbs
and
such
a
pliancy
to
every
part
as
necessarily
produce
these
compressions
extensions
contortions
dilatations
and
all
other
kinds
of
motions
that
are
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
such
a
system
of
tubes
and
glands
as
has
been
before
mentioned
and
that
we
might
not
want
inducements
to
engage
us
in
such
an
exercise
of
the
body
as
is
proper
for
its
welfare
it
is
so
ordered
that
nothing
valuable
can
be
procured
without
it
not
to
mention
riches
and
honour
even
food
and
raiment
are
not
to
be
come
at
without
the
toil
of
the
hands
and
sweat
of
the
brows
providence
furnishes
materials
but
expects
that
we
should
work
them
up
ourselves
the
earth
must
be
laboured
before
it
gives
its
increase
and
when
it
is
forced
into
its
several
products
how
many
hands
must
they
pass
through
before
they
are
fit
for
use
manufactures
trade
and
agriculture
naturally
employ
more
than
nineteen
parts
of
the
species
in
twenty
and
as
for
those
who
are
not
obliged
to
labour
by
the
condition
in
which
they
are
born
they
are
more
miserable
than
the
rest
of
mankind
unless
they
indulge
themselves
in
that
voluntary
labour
which
goes
by
the
name
of
exercise
my
friend
sir
roger
has
been
an
indefatigable
man
in
business
of
this
kind
and
has
hung
several
parts
of
his
house
with
the
trophies
of
his
former
labours
the
walls
of
his
great
hall
are
covered
with
the
horns
of
several
kinds
of
deer
that
he
has
killed
in
the
chase
which
he
thinks
the
most
valuable
furniture
of
his
house
as
they
afford
him
frequent
topics
of
discourse
and
show
that
he
has
not
been
idle
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
is
a
large
otter
skin
stuffed
with
hay
which
his
mother
ordered
to
be
hung
up
in
that
manner
and
the
knight
looks
upon
it
with
great
satisfaction
because
it
seems
he
was
but
nine
years
old
when
his
dog
killed
him
a
little
room
adjoining
to
the
hall
is
a
kind
of
arsenal
filled
with
guns
of
several
sizes
and
inventions
with
which
the
knight
has
made
great
havoc
in
the
woods
and
destroyed
many
thousands
of
pheasants
partridges
and
woodcocks
his
stable
doors
are
patched
with
noses
that
belonged
to
foxes
of
the
knight
own
hunting
down
sir
roger
showed
me
one
of
them
that
for
distinction
sake
has
a
brass
nail
struck
through
it
which
cost
him
about
fifteen
hours
riding
carried
him
through
half
a
dozen
counties
killed
him
a
brace
of
geldings
and
lost
above
half
his
dogs
this
the
knight
looks
upon
as
one
of
the
greatest
exploits
of
his
life
the
perverse
widow
whom
i
have
given
some
account
of
was
the
death
of
several
foxes
for
sir
roger
has
told
me
that
in
the
course
of
his
amours
he
patched
the
western
door
of
his
stable
whenever
the
widow
was
cruel
the
foxes
were
sure
to
pay
for
it
in
proportion
as
his
passion
for
the
widow
abated
and
old
age
came
on
he
left
off
but
a
hare
is
not
yet
safe
that
sits
within
ten
miles
of
his
house
there
is
no
kind
of
exercise
which
i
would
so
recommend
to
my
readers
of
both
sexes
as
this
of
riding
as
there
is
none
which
so
much
conduces
to
health
and
is
every
way
accommodated
to
the
body
according
to
the
which
i
have
given
of
it
doctor
sydenham
is
very
lavish
in
its
praises
and
if
the
english
reader
will
see
the
mechanical
effects
of
it
described
at
length
he
may
find
them
in
a
book
published
not
many
years
since
under
the
title
of
for
my
own
part
when
i
am
in
town
for
want
of
these
opportunities
i
exercise
myself
an
hour
every
morning
upon
a
dumb
bell
that
is
placed
in
a
corner
of
my
room
and
pleases
me
the
more
because
it
does
everything
i
require
of
it
in
the
most
profound
silence
my
landlady
and
her
daughters
are
so
well
acquainted
with
my
hours
of
exercise
that
they
never
come
into
my
room
to
disturb
me
whilst
i
am
ringing
when
i
was
some
years
younger
than
i
am
at
present
i
used
to
employ
myself
in
a
more
laborious
diversion
which
i
learned
from
a
latin
treatise
of
exercises
that
is
written
with
great
erudition
it
is
there
called
the
greek
skiomachia
or
the
fighting
with
a
man
own
shadow
and
consists
in
the
brandishing
of
two
short
sticks
grasped
in
each
hand
and
loaden
with
plugs
of
lead
at
either
end
this
opens
the
chest
exercises
the
limbs
and
gives
a
man
all
the
pleasure
of
boxing
without
the
blows
i
could
wish
that
several
learned
men
would
lay
out
that

i
have
heard
of
a
gentleman
who
was
under
close
confinement
in
the
bastile
seven
years
during
which
time
he
amused
himself
in
scattering
a
few
small
pins
about
his
chamber
gathering
them
up
again
and
placing
them
in
different
figures
on
the
arm
of
a
great
chair
he
often
told
his
friends
afterwards
that
unless
he
had
found
out
this
piece
of
exercise
he
verily
believed
he
should
have
lost
his
senses
after
what
has
been
said
i
need
not
inform
my
readers
that
sir
roger
with
whose
character
i
hope
they
are
at
present
pretty
well
acquainted
has
in
his
youth
gone
through
the
whole
course
of
those
rural
diversions
which
the
country
abounds
in
and
which
seem
to
be
extremely
well
suited
to
that
laborious
industry
a
man
may
observe
here
in
a
far
greater
degree
than
in
towns
and
cities
i
have
before
hinted
at
some
of
my
exploits
he
has
in
his
youthful
days
taken
forty
coveys
of
partridges
in
a
season
and
tired
many
a
salmon
with
a
line
consisting
but
of
a
single
hair
the
constant
thanks
and
good
wishes
of
the
neighbourhood
always
attended
him
on
account
of
his
remarkable
enmity
towards
foxes
having
destroyed
more
of
those
vermin
in
one
year
than
it
was
thought
the
whole
country
could
have
produced
indeed
the
knight
does
not
scruple
to
own
among
his
most
intimate
friends
that
in
order
to
establish
his
reputation
this
way
he
has
secretly
sent
for
great
numbers
of
them
out
of
other
counties
which
he
used
to
turn
loose
about
the
country
by
night
that
he
might
the
better
signalise
himself
in
their
destruction
the
next
day
his
hunting
horses
were
the
finest
and
best
managed
in
all
these
parts
his
tenants
are
still
full
of
the
praises
of
a
grey
that
unhappily
staked
himself
several
years
since
and
was
buried
with
great
solemnity
in
the
orchard
sir
roger
being
at
present
too
old
for
to
keep
himself
in
action
has
disposed
of
his
beagles
and
got
a
pack
of
what
these
want
in
speed
he
endeavours
to
make
amends
for
by
the
deepness
of
their
mouths
and
the
variety
of
their
notes
which
are
suited
in
such
manner
to
each
other
that
the
whole
cry
makes
up
a
complete
concert
he
is
so
nice
in
this
particular
that
a
gentleman
having
made
him
a
present
of
a
very
fine
hound
the
other
day
the
knight
returned
it
by
the
servant
with
a
great
many
expressions
of
civility
but
desired
him
to
tell
his
master
that
the
dog
he
had
sent
was
indeed
a
most
excellent
bass
but
that
at
present
he
only
wanted
a
could
i
believe
my
friend
had
ever
read
shakespeare
i
should
certainly
conclude
he
had
taken
the
hint
from
theseus
in
the
night
my
hounds
are
bred
out
of
the
spartan
kind
so
flu
so
sanded
and
their
heads
are
hung
with
ears
that
sweep
away
the
morning
dew
and
like
thessalian
bulls
slow
in
pursuit
but
match
in
mouths
like
bells
each
under
each
a
cry
more
tuneable
was
never
halloo
to
nor
cheer
with
horn
sir
roger
is
so
keen
at
this
sport
that
he
has
been
out
almost
every
day
since
i
came
down
and
upon
the
chaplain
offering
to
lend
me
his
easy
pad
i
was
prevailed
on
yesterday
morning
to
make
one
of
the
company
i
was
extremely
pleased
as
we
rid
along
to
observe
the
general
benevolence
of
all
the
neighbourhood
towards
my
friend
the
sons
thought
themselves
happy
if
they
could
open
a
gate
for
the
good
old
knight
as
he
passed
by
which
he
generally
requited
with
a
nod
or
a
smile
and
a
kind
inquiry
after
their
fathers
and
uncles
after
we
had
rid
about
a
mile
from
home
we
came
upon
a
large
heath
and
the
sportsmen
began
to
beat
they
had
done
so
for
some
time
when
as
i
was
at
a
little
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
company
i
saw
a
hare
pop
out
from
a
small
almost
under
my
horse
feet
i
marked
the
way
she
took
which
i
endeavoured
to
make
the
company
sensible
of
by
extending
my
arm
but
to
no
purpose
until
sir
roger
who
knows
that
none
of
my
extraordinary
motions
are
insignificant
rode
up
to
me
and
asked
me
if
puss
was
gone
that
way
upon
my
answering
yes
he
immediately
called
in
the
dogs
and
put
them
upon
the
scent
as
they
were
going
off
i
heard
one
of
the
country
fellows
muttering
to
his
companion
that
it
was
a
wonder
they
had
not
lost
all
their
sport
for
want
of
the
silent
gentleman
crying
away
this
with
my
aversion
to
leaping
hedges
made
me
withdraw
to
a
rising
ground
from
whence
i
could
have
the
pleasure
of
the
whole
chase
without
the
fatigue
of
keeping
in
with
the
hounds
the
hare
immediately
threw
them
above
a
mile
behind
her
but
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
instead
of
running
straight
forwards
or
in
hunter
language
flying
the
country
as
i
was
afraid
she
might
have
done
she
wheeled
about
and
described
a
sort
of
circle
round
the
hill
where
i
had
taken
my
station
in
such
manner
as
gave
me
a
very
distinct
view
of
the
sport
i
could
see
her
first
pass
by
and
the
dogs
some
time
afterwards
unravelling
the
whole
track
she
had
made
and
following
her
through
all
her
doubles
i
was
at
the
same
time
delighted
in
observing
that
deference
which
the
rest
of
the
pack
paid
to
each
particular
hound
according
to
the
character
he
had
acquired
amongst
them
if
they
were
at
a
fault
and
an
old
hound
of
reputation
opened
but
once
he
was
immediately
followed
by
the
whole
cry
while
a
raw
dog
or
one
who
was
a
noted
liar
might
have
yelped
his
heart
out
without
being
taken
notice
of
the
hare
now
after
having
squatted
two
or
three
times
and
been
put
up
again
as
often
came
still
nearer
to
the
place
where
she
was
at
first
started
the
dogs
pursued
her
and
these
were
followed
by
the
jolly
knight
who
rode
upon
a
white
gelding
encompassed
by
his
tenants
and
servants
and
cheering
his
hounds
with
all
the
gaiety
of
five
and
twenty
one
of
the
sportsmen
rode
up
to
me
and
told
me
that
he
was
sure
the
chase
was
almost
at
an
end
because
the
old
dogs
which
had
hitherto
lain
behind
now
headed
the
pack
the
fellow
was
in
the
right
our
hare
took
a
large
field
just
under
us
followed
by
the
full
cry
in
view
i
must
confess
the
brightness
of
the
weather
the
cheerfulness
of
everything
around
me
the
chiding
of
the
hounds
which
was
returned
upon
us
in
a
double
echo
from
two
neighbouring
hills
with
the
hallooing
of
the
sportsmen
and
the
sounding
of
the
horn
lifted
my
spirits
into
a
most
lively
pleasure
which
i
freely
indulged
because
i
knew
it
was
innocent
if
i
was
under
any
concern
it
was
on
the
account
of
the
poor
hare
that
was
now
quite
spent
and
almost
within
the
reach
of
her
enemies
when
the
huntsman
getting
forward
threw
down
his
pole
before
the
dogs
they
were
now
within
eight
yards
of
that
game
which
they
had
been
pursuing
for
almost
as
many
hours
yet
on
the
signal
before
mentioned
they
all
made
a
sudden
stand
and
though
they
continued
opening
as
much
as
before
durst
not
once
attempt
to
pass
beyond
the
pole
at
the
same
time
sir
roger
rode
forward
and
alighting
took
up
the
hare
in
his
arms
which
he
soon
delivered
to
one
of
his
servants
with
an
order
if
she
could
be
kept
alive
to
let
her
go
in
his
great
orchard
where
it
seems
he
has
several
of
these
prisoners
of
war
who
live
together
in
a
very
comfortable
captivity
i
was
highly
pleased
to
see
the
discipline
of
the
pack
and
the
good
nature
of
the
knight
who
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
murder
a
creature
that
had
given
him
so
much
diversion
illustration
chearing
his
hounds
with
all
the
gaiety
of
five
and
twenty
as
we
were
returning
home
i
remembered
that
monsieur
paschal
in
his
most
excellent
discourse
on
the
misery
of
man
tells
us
that
all
our
endeavours
after
greatness
proceed
from
nothing
but
a
desire
of
being
surrounded
by
a
multitude
of
persons
and
affairs
that
may
hinder
us
from
looking
into
ourselves
which
is
a
view
we
can
not
bear
he
afterwards
goes
on
to
show
that
our
love
of
sports
comes
from
the
same
reason
and
is
particularly
severe
upon
hunting
what
says
he
unless
it
be
to
drown
thought
can
make
men
throw
away
so
much
time
and
pains
upon
a
silly
animal
which
they
might
buy
cheaper
in
the
market
the
foregoing
reflection
is
certainly
just
when
a
man
suffers
his
whole
mind
to
be
drawn
into
his
sports
and
altogether
loses
himself
in
the
woods
but
does
not
affect
those
who
propose
a
far
more
laudable
end
for
this
exercise
i
mean
the
preservation
of
health
and
keeping
all
the
organs
of
the
soul
in
a
condition

execute
her
orders

that
incomparable
person
whom
i
last
quoted
been
a
little
more
indulgent
to
himself
in
this
point
the
world
might
probably
have
enjoyed
him
much
longer
whereas
through
too
great
an
application
to
his
studies
in
his
youth
he
contracted
that
ill
habit
of
body
which
after
a
tedious
sickness
carried
him
off
in
the
fortieth
year
of
his
age
and
the
whole
history
we
have
of
his
life
till
that
time
is
but
one
continued
account
of
the
behaviour
of
a
noble
soul
struggling
under
innumerable
pains
and
distempers
for
my
own
part
i
intend
to
hunt
twice
a
week
during
my
stay
with
sir
roger
and
shall
prescribe
the
moderate
use
of
this
exercise

all
my

there
are
some
opinions
in
which
a
man
should
stand
neuter
without
engaging
his
assent
to
one
side
or
the

such
a
hovering
faith
as
this
which
refuses
to
settle
upon

is
absolutely
necessary
in

is

press

is
to
give
up

neither
it
is
with
this
temper
of
mind
that
i
consider
the
subject
of
witchcraft
when
i
hear
the
relations
that
are
made
from
all
parts
of
the
world
not
only
from
norway
and
lapland
from
the
east
and
west
indies
but
from
every
particular
nation
in
europe
i
can
not
forbear
thinking
that
there
is
such
an
intercourse
and
commerce
with
evil
spirits
as
that
which
we
express
by
the
name
of
witchcraft
but
when
i
consider
that
the
ignorant
and
credulous
parts
of
the
world
abound
most
in
these
relations
and
that
the
persons
among
us
who
are
supposed
to
engage
in
such
an
infernal
commerce
are
people
of
a
weak
understanding
and
crazed
imagination
and
at
the
same
time
reflect
upon
the
many
impostures
and
delusions
of
this
nature
that
have
been
detected
in
all
ages
i
endeavour
to
suspend
my
belief
till
i
hear
more
certain
accounts
than
any
which
have
yet
come
to
my
knowledge
in
short
when
i
consider
the
question
whether
there
are
such
persons
in
the
world
as
those
we
call
witches
my
mind
is
divided
between
the
two
opposite
opinions
or
rather
to
speak
my
thoughts
freely
i
believe
in
general
that
there
is
and
has
been
such
a
thing
as
witchcraft
but
at
the
same
time
can
give
no
credit
to
any
particular
instance
of
it
i
am
engaged
in
this
speculation
by
some
occurrences
that
i
met
with
yesterday
which
i
shall
give
my
reader
an
account
of
at
large
as
i
was
walking
with
my
friend
sir
roger
by
the
side
of
one
of
his
woods
an
old
woman
applied
herself
to
me
for
my
charity
her
dress
and
figure
put
me
in
mind
of
the
following
description
in
otway
in
a
close
lane
as
i
pursu
my
journey
i
spy
a
wrinkled
hag
with
age
grown
double
picking
dry
sticks
and
mumbling
to
herself
her
eyes
with
scalding
rheum
were
gall
and
red
cold
palsy
shook
her
head
her
hands
seem
wither
and
on
her
crooked
shoulders
had
she
the
tatter
remnants
of
an
old
strip
hanging
which
serv
to
keep
her
carcase
from
the
cold
so
there
was
nothing
of
a
piece
about
her
her
lower
weeds
were
all
coarsely
with
rags
black
red
white
yellow
and
seem
to
speak
variety
of
wretchedness
as
i
was
musing
on
this
description
and
comparing
it
with
the
object
before
me
the
knight
told
me
that
this
very
old
woman
had
the
reputation
of
a
witch
all
over
the
country
that
her
lips
were
observed
to
be
always
in
motion
and
that
there
was
not
a
switch
about
her
house
which
her
neighbours
did
not
believe
had
carried
her
several
hundreds
of
miles
if
she
chanced
to
stumble
they
always
found
sticks
or
straws
that
lay
in
the
figure
of
a
cross
before
her
if
she
made
any
mistake
at
church
and
cried
amen
in
a
wrong
place
they
never
failed
to
conclude
that
she
was
saying
her
prayers
backwards
there
was
not
a
maid
in
the
parish
that
would
take
a
pin
of
her
though
she
should
offer
a
bag
of
money
with
it
she
goes
by
the
name
of
moll
white
and
has
made
the
country
ring
with
several
imaginary
exploits
which
are
palmed
upon
her
if
the
does
not
make
the
butter
come
so
soon
as
she
would
have
it

if

out

moll
white
this
account
raised
my
curiosity
so
far
that
i
begged
my
friend
sir
roger
to
go
with
me
into
her
hovel
which
stood
in
a
solitary
corner
under
the
side
of
the
wood
upon
our
first
entering
sir
roger
winked
to
me
and
pointed
at
something
that
stood
behind
the
door
which
upon
looking
that
way
i
found
to
be
an
old
broomstaff
at
the
same
time
he
whispered
me
in
the
ear
to
take
notice
of
a
tabby
cat
that
sat
in
the
which
as
the
old
knight
told
me
lay
under
as
bad
a
report
as
moll
white
herself
for
besides
that
moll
is
said
often
to
accompany
her
in
the
same
shape
the
cat
is
reported
to
have
spoken
twice
or
thrice
in
her
life
and
to
have
played
several
pranks
above
the
capacity
of
an
ordinary
cat
i
was
secretly
concerned
to
see
human
nature
in
so
much
wretchedness
and
disgrace
but
at
the
same
time
could
not
forbear
smiling
to
hear
sir
roger
who
is
a
little
puzzled
about
the
old
woman
advising
her
as
a
justice
of
peace
to
avoid
all
communication
with
the
devil
and
never
to
hurt
any
of
her
neighbour
cattle
we
concluded
our
visit
with
a
bounty
which
was
very
acceptable
in
our
return
home
sir
roger
told
me
that
old
moll
had
been
often
brought
before
him
for
making
children
spit
pins
and
giving
maids
the
nightmare
and
that
the
country
people
would
be
tossing
her
into
a
pond
and
trying
experiments
with
her
every
day
if
it
was
not
for
him
and
his
chaplain
i
have
since
found
upon
inquiry
that
sir
roger
was
several
times
staggered
with
the
reports
that
had
been
brought
him
concerning
this
old
woman
and
would
frequently
have
bound
her
over
to
the
county
sessions
had
not
his
chaplain
with
much
ado
persuaded
him
to
the
contrary
i
have
been
the
more
particular
in
this
account
because
i
hear
there
is
scarce
a
village
in
england
that
has
not
a
moll
white
in
it
when
an
old
woman
begins
to
dote
and
grow
chargeable
to
a
parish
she
is
generally
turned
into
a
witch
and
fills
the
whole
country
with
extravagant
fancies
imaginary
distempers
and
terrifying
dreams
in
the
meantime
the
poor
wretch
that
is
the
innocent
occasion
of
so
many
evils
begins
to
be
frighted
at
herself
and
sometimes
confesses
secret
commerce
and
familiarities
that
her
imagination
forms
in
a
delirious
old
age
this
frequently
cuts
off
charity
from
the
greatest
objects
of
compassion
and
inspires
people
with
a
malevolence
towards
those
poor
decrepit
parts
of
our
species
in
whom
human
nature
is
defaced
by
infirmity
and
dotage

this
agreeable
seat
is
surrounded
with
so
many
pleasing
walks
which
are
struck
out
of
a
wood
in
the
midst
of
which
the
house
stands
that
one
can
hardly
ever
be
weary
of
rambling
from
one
labyrinth
of
delight
to
another
to
one
used
to
live
in
a
city
the
charms
of
the
country
are
so
exquisite
that
the
mind
is
lost
in
a
certain
transport
which
raises
us
above
ordinary
life
and
is
yet
not
strong
enough
to
be
inconsistent
with
tranquillity
this
state
of
mind
was
i
in
ravished
with
the
murmur
of
waters
the
whisper
of
breezes
the
singing
of
birds
and
whether
i
looked
up
to
the
heavens
down
to
the
earth
or
turned
on
the
prospects
around
me
still
struck
with
new
sense
of
pleasure
when
i
found
by
the
voice
of
my
friend
who
walked
by
me
that
we
had
insensibly
strolled
into
the
grove
sacred
to
the
widow
this
woman
says
he
is
of
all
others
the
most
unintelligible
she
either
designs
to
marry
or
she
does
not
what
is
the
most
perplexing
of
all
is
that
she
doth
not
either
say
to
her
lovers
she
has
any
resolution
against
that
condition
of
life
in
general
or
that
she
banishes
them
but
conscious
of
her
own
merit
she
permits
their
addresses
without
fear
of
any
ill
consequence
or
want
of
respect
from
their
rage
or
despair
she
has
that
in
her
aspect
against
which
it
is
impossible
to
offend
a
man
whose
thoughts
are
constantly
bent
upon
so
agreeable
an
object
must
be
excused
if
the
ordinary
occurrences
in
conversation
are
below
his
attention
i
call
her
indeed
perverse
but
alas
why
do
i
call
her
so
because
her
superior
merit
is
such
that
i
can
not
approach
her
without
awe
that
my
heart
is
checked
by
too
much
esteem
i
am
angry
that
her
charms
are
not
more
acceptable
that
i
am
more
inclined
to
worship
than
salute
her
how
often
have
i
wished
her
unhappy
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
serving
her
and
how
often
troubled
in
that
very
imagination
at
giving
her
the
pain
of
being
obliged
well
i
have
led
a
miserable
life
in
secret
upon
her
account
but
fancy
she
would
have
condescended
to
have
some
regard
for
me
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
watchful
animal
her
confidant
of
all
persons
under
the
sun
continued
he
calling
me
by
my
name
be
sure
to
set
a
mark
upon
confidants
they
are
of
all
people
the
most
impertinent
what
is
most
pleasant
to
observe
in
them
is
that
they
assume
to
themselves
the
merit
of
the
persons
whom
they
have
in
their
custody
orestilla
is
a
great
fortune
and
in
wonderful
danger
of
surprises
therefore
full
of
suspicions
of
the
least
indifferent
thing
particularly
careful
of
new
acquaintance
and
of
growing
too
familiar
with
the
old
themista
her
favourite
woman
is
every
whit
as
careful
of
whom
she
speaks
to
and
what
she
says
let
the
ward
be
a
beauty
her
confidant
shall
treat
you
with
an
air
of
distance
let
her
be
a
fortune
and
she
assumes
the
suspicious
behaviour
of
her
friend
and
patroness
thus
it
is
that
very
many
of
our
unmarried
women
of
distinction
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
married
except
the
consideration
of
different
sexes
they
are
directly
under
the
conduct
of
their
whisperer
and
think
they
are
in
a
state
of
freedom
while
they
can
prate
with
one
of
these
attendants
of
all
men
in
general
and
still
avoid
the
man
they
most
like
you
do
not
see
one
heiress
in
a
hundred
whose
fate
does
not
turn
upon
this
circumstance
of
choosing
a
confidant
thus
it
is
that
the
lady
is
addressed
to
presented
and
flattered
only
by
proxy
in
her
woman
in
my
case
how
is
it
possible
that
sir
roger
was
proceeding
in
his
harangue
when
we
heard
the
voice
of
one
speaking
very
importunately
and
repeating
these
words
what
not
one
smile
we
followed
the
sound
till
we
came
to
a
close
thicket
on
the
other
side
of
which
we
saw
a
young
woman
sitting
as
it
were
in
a
personated
sullenness
just
over
a
transparent
fountain
opposite
to
her
stood
william
sir
master
of
the
game
the
knight
whispered
me
hist
these
are
lovers
the
huntsman
looking
earnestly
at
the
shadow
of
the
young
maiden
in
the
stream
oh
thou
dear
picture
if
thou
couldst
remain
there
in
the
absence
of
that
fair
creature
whom
you
represent
in
the
water
how
willingly
could
i
stand
here
satisfied
for
ever
without
troubling
my
dear
betty
herself
with
any
mention
of
her
unfortunate
william
whom
she
is
angry
with
but
alas
when
she
pleases
to
be
gone
thou
wilt
also
vanish
yet
let
me
talk
to
thee
while
thou
dost
stay
tell
my
dearest
betty
thou
dost
not
more
depend
upon
her
than
does
her
william
her
absence
will
make
away
with
me
as
well
as
thee
if
she
offers
to
remove
thee
i
will
jump
into
these
waves
to
lay
hold
on
thee
herself
her
own
dear
person
i
must
never
embrace
still
do
you
hear
me
without
one
smile
it
is
too
much
to
bear
he
had
no
sooner
spoke
these
words
but
he
made
an
offer
of
throwing
himself
into
the
water
at
which
his
mistress
started
up
and
at
the
next
instant
he
jumped
across
the
fountain
and
met
her
in
an
embrace
she
half
recovering
from
her
fright
said
in
the
most
charming
voice
imaginable
and
with
a
tone
of
complaint
i
thought
how
well
you
would
drown
yourself
no
no
you
wo
drown
yourself
till
you
have
taken
your
leave
of
susan
holiday
the
huntsman
with
a
tenderness
that
spoke
the
most
passionate
love
and
with
his
cheek
close
to
hers
whispered
the
softest
vows
of
fidelity
in
her
ear
and
cried
do
my
dear
believe
a
word
kate
willow
says
she
is
spiteful
and
makes
stories
because
she
loves
to
hear
me
talk
to
herself
for
your
sake
look
you
there
quoth
sir
roger
do
you
see
there
all
mischief
comes
from
confidants
but
let
us
not
interrupt
them
the
maid
is
honest
and
the
man
dares
not
be
otherwise
for
he
knows
i
loved
her
father
i
will
interpose
in
this
matter
and
hasten
the
wedding
kate
willow
is
a
witty
mischievous
wench
in
the
neighbourhood
who
was
a
beauty
and
makes
me
hope
i
shall
see
the
perverse
widow
in
her
condition
she
was
so
flippant
with
her
answers
to
all
the
honest
fellows
that
came
near
her
and
so
very
vain
of
her
beauty
that
she
has
valued
herself
upon
her
charms
till
they
are
ceased
she
therefore
now
makes
it
her
business
to
prevent
other
young
women
from
being
more
discreet
than
she
was
herself
however
the
saucy
thing
said
the
other
day
well
enough
roger
and
i
must
make
a
match
for
we
are
both
despised
by
those
we
loved
the
hussy
has
a
great
deal
of
power
wherever
she
comes
and
has
her
share
of
cunning
however
when
i
reflect
upon
this
woman
i
do
not
know
whether
in
the
main
i
am
the
worse
for
having
loved
her
whenever
she
is
recalled
to
my
imagination
my
youth
returns
and
i
feel
a
forgotten
warmth
in
my
veins
this
affliction
in
my
life
has
streaked
all
my
conduct
with
a
softness
of
which
i
should
otherwise
have
been
incapable
it
is
perhaps
to
this
dear
image
in
my
heart
owing
that
i
am
apt
to
relent
that
i
easily
forgive
and
that
many
desirable
things
are
grown
into
my
temper
which
i
should
not
have
arrived
at
by
better
motives
than
the
thought
of
being
one
day
hers
i
am
pretty
well
satisfied
such
a
passion
as
i
have
had
is
never
well
cured
and
between
you
and
me
i
am
often
apt
to
imagine
it
has
had
some
whimsical
effect
upon
my
brain
for
i
frequently
find
that
in
my
most
serious
discourse
i
let
fall
some
comical
familiarity
of
speech
or
odd
phrase
that
makes
the
company
laugh
however
i
can
not
but
allow
she
is
a
most
excellent
woman
when
she
is
in
the
country
i
warrant
she
does
not
run
into
dairies
but
reads
upon
the
nature
of
plants
but
has
a
and
comes
into
the
garden
out
of
books
to
see
them
work
and
observe
the
policies
of

commonwealth
she
understands
everything
i
would
give
ten
pounds

hear
her
argue
with
my

sir
andrew

about

by

opinion

my
worthy

sir
roger
is
one
of
those
who
is
not
only
at
peace
within
himself
but
beloved
and
esteemed
by
all
about
him
he
receives
a
suitable
tribute
for
his
universal
benevolence
to
mankind
in
the
returns
of
affection
and
which
are
paid
him
by
every
one
that
lives
within
his
neighbourhood
i
lately
met
with
two
or
three
odd
instances
of
that
general
respect
which
is
shown
to
the
good
old
knight
he
would
needs
carry
will
wimble
and
myself
with
him
to
the
county
assizes
as
we
were
upon
the
road
will
wimble
joined
a
couple
of
plain
men
who
rid
before
us
and
conversed
with
them
for
some
time
during
which
my
friend
sir
roger
acquainted
me
with
their
characters
the
first
of
them
says
he
that
has
a
spaniel
by
his
side
is
a
yeoman
of
about
an
hundred
pounds
a
year
an
honest
man
he
is
just
within
the
game
act
and
qualified
to
kill
an
hare
or
a
pheasant
he
knocks
down
a
dinner
with
his
gun
twice
or
thrice
a
week
and
by
that
means
lives
much
cheaper
than
those
who
have
not
so
good
an
estate
as
himself
he
would
be
a
good
neighbour
if
he
did
not
destroy
so
many
partridges
in
short
he
is
a
very
sensible
man
shoots
flying
and
has
been
several
times
foreman
of
the
petty
jury
the
other
that
rides
along
with
him
is
tom
touchy
a
fellow
famous
for
taking
the
law
of
everybody
there
is
not
one
in
the
town
where
he
lives
that
he
has
not
sued
at
the
quarter
sessions
the
rogue
had
once
the
impudence
to
go
to
law
with
the
widow
his
head
is
full
of
costs
damages
and
ejectments
he
plagued
a
couple
of
honest
gentlemen
so
long
for
a
trespass
in
breaking
one
of
his
hedges
till
he
was
forced
to
sell
the
ground
it
inclosed
to
defray
the
charges
of
the
prosecution
his
father
left
him
fourscore
pounds
a
year
but
he
has
cast
and
been
cast
so
often
that
he
is
not
now

as
sir
roger
was
giving
me
this
account
of
tom

will
wimble
and
his
two
companions
stopped
short
till
we
came
up
to
them
after
having
paid
their
respects
to
sir
roger
will
told
him
that
mr
touchy
and
he
must
appeal
to
him
upon
a
dispute
that
arose
between
them
will
it
seems
had
been
giving
his
an
account
of
his
angling
one
day
in
such
a
hole
when
tom
touchy
instead
of
hearing
out
his
story
told
him
that
if
he
pleased
might
take
the
law
of
him
for
fishing
in
that
part
of
the
river
my
friend
sir
roger
heard
them
both
upon
a
round
trot
and
after
having
paused
some
time
told
them
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
would
not
give
his
judgment
rashly
that
much
might
be
said
on
both
sides
they
were
neither
of
them
dissatisfied
with
the
knight
determination
because
neither
of
them
found
himself
in
the
wrong
by
it
upon
which
we
made
the
best
of
our
way
to
the
assizes
the
court
was
sat
before
sir
roger
came
but
notwithstanding
all
the
justices
had
taken
their
places
upon
the
bench
they
made
room
for
the
old
knight
at
the
head
of
them
who
for
his
reputation
in
the
county
took
occasion
to
whisper
in
the
judge
ear
that
he
was
glad
his
lordship
had
met
with
so
much
good
weather
in
his
circuit
i
was
listening
to
the
proceeding
of
the
court
with
much
attention
and
infinitely
pleased
with
that
great
appearance
and
solemnity
which
so
properly
accompanies
such
a
public
administration
of
our
laws
when
after
about
an
hour
sitting
i
observed
to
my
great
surprise
in
the
midst
of
a
trial
that
my
friend
sir
roger
was
getting
up
to
speak
i
was
in
some
pain
for
him
till
i
found
he
had
acquitted
himself
of
two
or
three
sentences
with
a
look
of
much
business
and
great
intrepidity
upon
his
first
rising
the
court
was
hushed
and
a
general
whisper
ran
among
the
country
people
that
sir
roger
was
up
the
speech
he
made
was
so
little
to
the
purpose
that
i
shall
not
trouble
my
readers
with
an
account
of
it
and
i
believe
was
not
so
much
designed
by
the
knight
himself
to
inform
the
court
as
to
give
him
a
figure
in
my
eye
and
keep
up
his
credit
in
the
country
i
was
highly
delighted
when
the
court
rose
to
see
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
gathering
about
my
old
friend
and
striving
who
should
compliment
him
most
at
the
same
time
that
the
ordinary
people
gazed
upon
him
at
a
distance
not
a
little
admiring
his
courage
that
was
not
afraid
to
speak
to
the
judge
in
our
return
home
we
met
with
a
very
odd
accident
which
i
can
not
forbear
relating
because
it
shows
how
desirous
all
who
know
sir
roger
are
of
giving
him
marks
of
their
esteem
when
we
were
arrived
upon
the
verge
of
his
estate
we
stopped
at
a
little
inn
to
rest
ourselves
and
our
horses
the
man
of
the
house
had
it
seems
been
formerly
a
servant
in
the
knight
family
and
to
do
honour
to
his
old
master
had
some
time
since
unknown
to
sir
roger
put
him
up
in
a
before
the
door
so
that
the
knight
head
had
hung
out
upon
the
road
about
a
week
before
he
himself
knew
anything
of
the
matter
as
soon
as
sir
roger
was
acquainted
with
it
finding
that
his
servant
indiscretion
proceeded
wholly
from
affection
and
he
only
told
him
that
he
had
made
him
too
high
a
compliment
and
when
the
fellow
seemed
to
think
that
could
hardly
be
added
with
a
more
decisive
look
that
it
was
too
great
an
honour
for
any
man
under
a
duke
but
told
him
at
the
same
time
that
it
might
be
altered
with
a
very
few
touches
and
that
he
himself
would
be
at
the
charge
of
it
accordingly
they
got
a
painter
by
the
knight
directions
to
add
a
pair
of
whiskers
to
the
face
and
by
a
little
aggravation
of
the
features
to
change
it
into
the
saracen
head
i
should
not
have
known
this
story
had
not
the
innkeeper
upon
sir
roger
alighting
told
him
in
my
hearing
that
his
honour
head
was
brought
back
last
night
with
the
alterations
that
he
had
ordered
to
be
made
in
it
upon
this
my
friend
with
his
usual
cheerfulness
related
the
particulars
above
mentioned
and
ordered
the
head
to
be
brought
into
the
room
i
could
not
forbear
discovering
greater
expressions
of
mirth
than
ordinary
upon
the
appearance
of
this
monstrous
face
under
which
notwithstanding
it
was
made
to
frown
and
stare
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
i
could
still
discover
a
distant
resemblance
of
my
old
friend
sir
roger
upon
seeing
me
laugh
desired
me
to
tell
him
truly
if
i
thought
it
possible
for
people
to
know
him
in
that
disguise
i
at
first
kept
my
usual
silence
but
upon
the
knight
conjuring
me
to
tell
him
whether
it
was
not
still
more
like
himself
than
a
saracen
i
composed
my
countenance
in
the
best
manner
i
could
and
replied
that
much
might
be
said
on
both
sides
these
several
adventures
with
the
knight
behaviour
in
them
gave
me
as
pleasant
a
day

i
was
yesterday
riding
out
in

with
my

we
saw
at
a
little
distance
from
us
a
troop
of
gipsies
upon
the
first
discovery
of
them
my
friend
was
in
some
doubt
whether
he
should
not
exert
the
justice
of
the
peace
upon
such
a
band
of
lawless
vagrants
but
not
having
his

him
who
is
a

counsellor
on

occasions
and
fearing
that
his
poultry
might
fare
the
worse
for
it
he
let
the
thought
drop
but
at
the
same
time
gave
me
a
particular
account
of
the
mischiefs
they
do
in
the
country
in
stealing
people
goods
and
spoiling
their
servants
if
a
stray

upon

says
sir

they
are
sure
to
have
it

the
hog
loses
his

in

fields
it
is
ten

but
he
becomes
their

our

can
not
live
in

for

if
a
man
prosecutes
them
with
severity
his
is
sure
to
pay
for

they
generally
straggle
into
these
parts
about
this

of
the

and
set
the
heads
of
our
so
agog
for

that
we
do
not
expect
to
have
any
business
done

it
should

an

who
crosses

never

your

the

sir
roger
observing
that
i
listened
with
great
attention
to
his
account
of
a
people
who
were
so
entirely
new
to
me
told
me
that
if
i
would
they
should
tell
us
our
fortunes
as
i
was
very
well
pleased
with
the
proposal
we
rid
up
and
communicated
our
hands
to
them
a
cassandra
of
the
crew
after
having
examined
my
lines
very
diligently
told
me
that
i
loved
a
pretty
maid
in
a
corner
that
i
was
a
good
man
with
some
other
particulars
which
i
do
not
think
proper
to
relate
my
friend
sir
roger
alighted
from
his
horse
and
exposing
his
palm
to
two
or
three
that
stood
by
him
they
crumpled
it
into
all
shapes
and
diligently
scanned
every
wrinkle
that
could
be
made
in
it
when
one
of
them
who
was
older
and
more
sunburnt
than
the
rest
told
him
that
he
had
a
widow
in
his
line
of
life
upon
which
the
knight
cried
go
go
you
are
an
idle
baggage
and
at
the
same
time
smiled
upon
me
the
gipsy
finding
he
was
not
displeased
in
his
heart
told
him
after
a
further
inquiry
into
his
hand
that
his
was
constant
and
that
she
should
dream
of
him
my
old
friend
cried
pish
and
bid
her
go
on
the
gipsy
told
him
that
he
was
a
bachelor
but
would
not
be
so
long
and
that
he
was
dearer
to
somebody
than
he
thought
the
knight
still
repeated
she
was
an
idle
baggage

bid
her
go

all
this
was
uttered

made
us
the
more
attentive

the
knight
left
the
money
with
her
that
he
had
crossed
her
hand
with
and
got
up
again
on
his
horse
as
we
were
riding
away
sir
roger
told
me
that
he
knew
several
sensible
people
who
believed
these
gipsies
now
and
then
foretold
very
strange
things
and
for
half
an
hour
together
appeared
more
jocund
than
ordinary
in
the
height
of
his
meeting
a
common
beggar
upon
the
road
who
was
no
conjurer
as
he
went
to
relieve
him
he
found
his
pocket
was
picked
that
being
a
kind
of
palmistry
at
which
this
race
of
vermin
are
very
dexterous
i
might
here
entertain
my
reader
with
historical
remarks
on
this
idle
profligate
people
who
infest
all
the
countries
of
europe
and
live
in
the
midst
of
governments
in
a
kind
of
commonwealth
by
themselves
but
instead
of
entering
into
observations
of
this
nature
i
shall
fill
the
remaining
part
of
my
paper
with
a
story
which
is
still
fresh
in
holland
and
was
printed
in
one
of
our
monthly
accounts
about
twenty
years
ago
as
the
or
which
carries
passengers
from
leyden
to
amsterdam
was
putting
off
a
boy
running
along
the
side
of
the
canal
desired
to
be
taken
in
which
the
master
of
the
boat
refused
because
the
lad
had
not
quite
money
enough
to
pay
the
usual
fare
an
eminent
merchant
being
pleased
with
the
looks
of
the
boy
and
secretly
touched
with
compassion
towards
him
paid
the
money
for
him
and
ordered
him
to
be
taken
on
board
upon
talking
with
him
afterwards
he
found
that
he
could
speak
readily
in
three
or
four
languages
and
learned
upon
further
examination
that
he
had
been
stolen
away
when
he
was
a
child
by
a
gipsy
and
had
rambled
ever
since
with
a
gang
of
those
strollers
up
and
down
several
parts
of
europe
it
happened
that
the
merchant
whose
heart
seems
to
have
inclined
towards
the
boy
by
a
secret
kind
of
instinct
had
himself
lost
a
child
some
years
before
the
parents
after
a
long
search
for
him
gave
him
for
drowned
in
one
of
the
canals
with
which
that
country
abounds
and
the
mother
was
so
afflicted
at
the
loss
of
a
fine
boy
who
was
her
only
son
that
she
died
for
grief
of
it
upon
laying
together
all
particulars
and
examining
the
several
moles
and
marks
by
which
the
mother
used
to
describe
the
child
when
he
was
first
missing
the
boy
proved
to
be
the
son
of
the
merchant
whose
heart
had
so
unaccountably
melted
at
the
sight
of
him
the
lad
was
very
well
pleased
to
find
a
father
who
was
so
rich
and
likely
to
leave
him
a
good
estate
the
father
on
the
other
hand
was
not
a
little
delighted
to
see
a
son
return
to
him
whom
he
had
given
for
lost
with
such
a
strength
of
constitution
sharpness
of
understanding
and
skill
in
languages
here
the
printed
story
leaves
off
but
if
i
may
give
credit
to
reports
our
linguist
having
received
such
extraordinary
rudiments
towards
a
good
education
was
afterwards
trained
up
in
everything
that
becomes
a
gentleman
wearing
off
by
little
and
little
all
the
vicious
habits
and
practices
that
he
had
been
used
to
in
the
course
of
his
peregrinations
nay
it
is
said
that
he
has
since
been
employed
in
foreign
courts
upon
national
business
with
great
reputation
to
himself
and
honour
to
those
who
sent
him
and
that
he
has
visited
several
countries
as
a
public
minister
in
which
he
formerly
wandered
as
a
gipsy

country
sports
to
preserve

on

divert
himself
upon

that

my

sir
roger
generally
goes
two

three

from

gets
into

frontiers

his
estate
before
he
beats
about

purpose

finding
diversion

about

for
these
reasons
the
country
gentleman
like
the
fox
seldom
preys
near
his
own
home
in
the
same
manner
i
have
made
a
month
excursion
out
of
the
town
which
is
the
great
field
of
game
for
sportsmen
of
my
species
to
try
my
fortune
in
the
country
where
i
have
started
several
subjects
and
hunted
them
down
with
some
pleasure
to
myself
and
i
hope
to
others
i
am
here
forced
to
use
a
great
deal
of
diligence
before
i
can
spring
anything
to
my
mind
whereas
in
town
whilst
i
am
following
one
character
it
is
ten
to
one
but
i
am
crossed
in
my
way
by
another
and
put
up
such
a
variety
of
odd
creatures
in
both
sexes
that
they
foil
the
scent
of
one
another
and
puzzle
the
chase
my
greatest
difficulty
in
the
country
is
to
find
sport
and
in
town
to
choose
it
in
the
meantime
as
i
have
given
a
whole
month
rest
to
the
cities
of
london
and
westminster
i
promise
myself
abundance
of
new
game
upon
my
return
thither
it
is
indeed
high
time
for
me
to
leave
the
country
since
i
find
the
whole
neighbourhood
begin
to
grow
very
inquisitive
after
my
name
and
character
my
love
of
solitude
taciturnity
and
particular
way
of
life
having
raised
a
great
curiosity
in
all
these
parts
the
notions
which
have
been
framed
of
me
are
various
some
look
upon
me
as
very
proud
some
as
very
modest
and
some
as
very
melancholy
will
wimble
as
my
friend
the
butler
tells
me
observing
me
very
much
alone
and
extremely
silent
when
i
am
in
company
is
afraid
i
have
killed
a
man
the
country
people
seem
to
suspect
me
for
a
conjurer
and
some
of
them
hearing
of
the
visit
which
i
made
to
moll
white
will
needs
have
it
that
sir
roger
has
brought
down
a
cunning
man
with
him
to
cure
the
old
woman
and
free
the
country
from
her
charms
so
that
the
character
which
i
go
under
in
part
of
the
neighbourhood
is
what
they
here
call
a
white
witch
a
justice
of
peace
who
lives
about
five
miles
off
and
is
not
of
sir
roger
party
has
it
seems
said
twice
or
thrice
at
his
table
that
he
wishes
sir
roger
does
not
harbour
a
jesuit
in
his
house
and
that
he
thinks
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
would
do
very
well
to
make
me
give
some
account
of
myself
on
the
other
side
some
of
sir
roger
friends
are
afraid
the
old
knight
is
imposed
upon
by
a
designing
fellow
and
as
they
have
heard
that
he
converses
very
promiscuously
when
he
is
in
town
do
not
know
but
he
has
brought
down
with
him
some
discarded
whig
that
is
sullen
and
says
nothing
because
he
is
out
of
place
such
is
the
variety
of
opinions
which
are
here
entertained
of
me
so
that
i
pass
among
some
for
a
disaffected
person
and
among
others
for
a
popish
priest
among
some
for
a
wizard
and
among
others
for
a
murderer
and
all
this
for
no
other
reason
that
i
can
imagine
but
because
i
do
not
hoot
and
hollow
and
make
a
noise
it
is
true
my
friend
sir
roger
tells
them
it
is
my
and
that
i
am
only
a
philosopher
but
this
will
not
satisfy
them
they
think
there
is
more
in
me
than
he

by

that
the

is
not
a

for
a

temper
who
does
not
love
jollity

dryden
i
was
this
morning
surprised
with
a
great
knocking
at
the
door
when
my
landlady
daughter
came
up
to
me
and
told
me
that
there
was
a
man
below
desired
to
speak
with
me
upon
my
asking
her
who
it
was
she
told
me
it
was
a
very
grave
elderly
person
but
that
she
did
not
know
his
name
i
immediately
went
down
to
him
and
found
him
to
be
the
coachman
of
my
worthy
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
he
told
me
that
his
master
came
to
town
last
night
and
would
be
glad
to
take
a
turn
with
me
in
inn
walks
as
i
was
wondering
in
myself
what
had
brought
sir
roger
to
town
not
having
lately
received
any
letter
from
him
he
told
me
that
his
master
was
come
up
to
get
a
sight
of
prince
eugene
and
that
he
desired
i
would
immediately
meet
him
i
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
curiosity
of
the
old
knight
though
i
did
not
much
wonder
at
it
having
heard
him
say
more
than
once
in
private
discourse
that
he
looked
upon
prince
eugenio
for
so
the
knight
always
calls
him
to
be
a
greater
man
than
scanderbeg
i
was
no
sooner
come
into
gray
inn
walks
but
i
heard
my
friend
upon
the
terrace
hemming
twice
or
thrice
to
himself
with
great
vigour
for
he
loves
to
clear
his
pipes
in
good
air
to
make
use
of
his
own
phrase
and
is
not
a
little
pleased
with
any
one
who
takes
notice
of
the
strength
which
he
still
exerts
in
his
morning
hems
i
was
touched
with
a
secret
joy
at
the
sight
of
the
good
old
man
who
before
he
saw
me
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
a
beggar
man
that
had
asked
an
alms
of
him
i
could
hear
my
friend
chide
him
for
not
finding
out
some
work
but
at
the
same
time
saw
him
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
give
him
sixpence
our
salutations
were
very
hearty
on
both
sides
consisting
of
many
kind
shakes
of
the
hand
and
several
affectionate
looks
which
we
cast
upon
one
another
after
which
the
knight
told
me
my
good
friend
his
chaplain
was
very
well
and
much
at
my
service
and
that
the
sunday
before
he
had
made
a
most
incomparable
sermon
out
of
barrow
i
have
left
says
he
all
my
affairs
in
his
hands
and
being
willing
to
lay
an
obligation
upon
him
have
deposited
with
him
thirty
merks
to
be
distributed
among
his
poor
parishioners
he
then
proceeded
to
acquaint
me
with
the
welfare
of
will
wimble
upon
which
he
put
his
hand
into
his
fob
and
presented
me
in
his
name
with
a
telling
me
that
will
had
been
busy
all
the
beginning
of
the
winter
in
turning
great
quantities
of
them
and
that
he
made
a
present
of
one
to
every
gentleman
in
the
country
who
has
good
principles
and
smokes
he
added
that
poor
will
was
at
present
under
great
tribulation
for
that
tom
touchy
had
taken
the
law
of
him
for
cutting
some
out
of
one
of
his
hedges
among
other
pieces
of
news
which
the
knight
brought
from
his
country
seat
he
informed
me
that
moll
white
was
dead
and
that
about
a
month
after
her
death
the
wind
was
so
very
high
that
it
blew
down
the
end
of
one
of
his
barns
but
for
my
own
part
says
sir
roger
i
do
not
think
that
the
old
woman
had
any
hand
in
it
he
afterwards
fell
into
an
account
of
the
diversions
which
had
passed
in
his
house
during
the
holidays
for
sir
roger
after
the
laudable
custom
of
his
ancestors
always
keeps
open
house
at
christmas
i
learned
from
him
that
he
had
killed
eight
fat
hogs
for
this
season
that
he
had
dealt
about
his
chines
very
liberally
amongst
his
neighbours
and
that
in
particular
he
had
sent
a
string
of
with
a
pack
of
cards
to
every
poor
family
in
the
parish
i
have
often
thought
says
sir
roger
it
happens
very
well
that
christmas
should
fall
out
in
the
middle
of
winter
it
is
the
most
dead
uncomfortable
time
of
the
year
when
the
poor
people
would
suffer
very
much
from
their
poverty
and
cold
if
they
had
not
good
cheer
warm
fires
and
christmas
gambols
to
support
them
i
love
to
rejoice
their
poor
hearts
at
this
season
and
to
see
the
whole
village
merry
in
my
great
hall
i
allow
a
double
quantity
of
malt
to
my
small
beer
and
set
it
a
running
for
twelve
days
to
every
one
that
calls
for
it
i
have
always
a
piece
of
cold
beef
and
a
upon
the
table
and
am
wonderfully
pleased
to
see
my
tenants
pass
away
a
whole
evening
in
playing
their
innocent
tricks
and
smutting
one
another
our
friend
will
wimble
is
as
merry
as
any
of
them
and
shows
a
thousand
roguish
tricks
upon
these
occasions
i
was
very
much
delighted
with
the
reflection
of
my
old
friend
which
carried
so
much
goodness
in
it
he
then
launched
out
into
the
praise
of
the
late
act
of
parliament
for
securing
the
church
of
england
and
told
me
with
great
satisfaction
that
he
believed
it
already
began
to
take
effect
for
that
a
rigid
dissenter
who
chanced
to
dine
at
his
house
on
christmas
day
had
been
observed
to
eat
very
plentifully
of
his
after
having
dispatched
all
our
country
matters
sir
roger
made
several
inquiries
concerning
the
club
and
particularly
of
his
old
antagonist
sir
andrew
freeport
he
asked
me
with
a
kind
of
a
smile
whether
sir
andrew
had
not
taken
the
advantage
of
his
absence
to
vent
among
them
some
of
his
republican
doctrines
but
soon
after
gathering
up
his
countenance
into
a
more
than
ordinary
seriousness
tell
me
truly
says
he
do
not
you
think
sir
andrew
had
a
hand
in
the
pope
procession
but
without
giving
me
time
to
answer
him
well
well
says
he
i
know
you
are
a
wary
man
and
do
not
care
to
talk
of
public
matters
the
knight
then
asked
me
if
i
had
seen
prince
eugenio
and
made
me
promise
to
get
him
a
stand
in
some
convenient
place
where
he
might
have
a
full
sight
of
that
extraordinary
man
whose
presence
does
so
much
honour
to
the
british
nation
he
dwelt
very
long
on
the
praises
of
this
great
general
and
i
found
that
since
i
was
with
him
in
the
country
he
had
drawn
many
just
observations
together
out
of
his
reading
in
and
other
authors
who
always
lie
in
his
hall
window
which
very
much
redound
to
the
honour
of
this
prince
having
passed
away
the
greatest
part
of
the
morning
in
hearing
the
knight
reflections
which
were
partly
private
and
partly
political
he
asked
me
if
i
would
smoke
a
pipe
with
him
over
a
dish
of
coffee
at
squire
as
i
love
the
old
man
i
take
delight
in
complying
with
everything
that
is
agreeable
to
him
and
accordingly
waited
on
him
to
the
where
his
venerable
figure
drew
upon
us
the
eyes
of
the
whole
room
he
had
no
sooner
seated
himself
at
the
upper
end
of
the
high
table
but
he
called
for
a
clean
pipe
a
paper
of
tobacco
a
dish
of
coffee
a
and
the
with
such
an
air
of
cheerfulness
and
good
humour
that
all
the
boys
in
the
who
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
serving
him
were
at
once
employed
on
his
several
errands
insomuch
that
nobody
else
could
come
at
a
dish
of
tea
until
the
knight
had
got
all
his
conveniences

my
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
told
me
the
other
night
that
he
had
been
reading
my
paper
upon
westminster
abbey
in
which
says
he
there
are
a
great
many
ingenious
fancies
he
told
me
at
the
same
time
that
he
observed
i
had
promised
another
paper
upon
the
tombs
and
that
he
should
be
glad
to
go
and
see
them
with
me
not
having
visited
them
since
he
had
read
history
i
could
not
at
first
imagine
how
this
came
into
the
knight
head
till
i
recollected
that
he
had
been
very
busy
all
last
summer
upon
baker
which
he
has
quoted
several
times
in
his
disputes
with
sir
andrew
freeport
since
his
last
coming
to
town
accordingly
i
promised
to
call
upon
him
the
next
morning
that
we
might
go
together
to
the
abbey
i
found
the
knight
under
his
butler
hands
who
always
shaves
him
he
was
no
sooner
dressed
than
he
called
for
a
glass
of
the
widow
water
which
they
told
me
he
always
drank
before
he
went
abroad
he
recommended
to
me
a
dram
of
it
at
the
same
time
with
so
much
heartiness
that
i
could
not
forbear
drinking
it
as
soon
as
i
had
got
it
down
i
found
it
very
unpalatable
upon
which
the
knight
observing
that
i
had
made
several
wry
faces
told
me
that
he
knew
i
should
not
like
it
at
first
but
that
it
was
the
best
thing
in
the
world
against
the
stone
or
gravel
i
could
have
wished
indeed
that
he
had
acquainted
me
with
the
virtues
of
it
sooner
but
it
was
too
late
to
complain
and
i
knew
what
he
had
done
was
out
of
goodwill
sir
roger
told
me
further
that
he
looked
upon
it
to
be
very
good
for
a
man
whilst
he
stayed
in
town
to
keep
off
infection
and
that
he
got
together
a
quantity
of
it
upon
the
first
news
of
the
sickness
being
at
dantzick
when
of
a
sudden
turning
short
to
one
of
his
servants
who
stood
behind
him
he
bid
him
call
a
and
take
care
it
was
an
elderly
man
that
drove
it
he
then
resumed
his
discourse
upon
trueby
water
telling
me
that
the
widow
trueby
was
one
who
did
more
good
than
all
the
doctors
or
apothecaries
in
the
country
that
she
distilled
every
poppy
that
grew
within
five
miles
of
her
that
she
distributed
her
water
gratis
among
all
sorts
of
people
to
which
the
knight
added
that
she
had
a
very
great
jointure
and
that
the
whole
country
would
fain
have
it
a
match
between
him
and
her
and
truly
says
sir
roger
if
i
had
not
been
engaged
perhaps
i
could
not
have
done
better
his
discourse
was
broken
off
by
his
man
telling
him
he
had
called
a
coach
upon
our
going
to
it
after
having
cast
his
eye
upon
the
wheels
he
asked
the
coachman
if
his
was
good
upon
the
telling
him
he
would
warrant
it
the
knight
turned
to
me
told
me
he
looked
like
an
honest
man
and
went
in
without
further
ceremony
we
had
not
gone
far
when
sir
roger
popping
out
his
head
called
the
coachman
down
from
his
box
and
upon
presenting
himself
at
the
window
asked
him
if
he
smoked
as
i
was
considering
what
this
would
end
in
he
bid
him
stop
by
the
way
at
any
good
tobacconist
and
take
in
a
roll
of
their
best
virginia
nothing
material
happened
in
the
remaining
part
of
our
journey
till
we
were
set
down
at
the
west
end
of
the
abbey
as
we
went
up
the
body
of
the
church
the
knight
pointed
at
the
trophies
upon
one
of
the
new
monuments
and
cried
out
a
brave
man
i
warrant
him
passing
afterwards
by
sir
cloudesley
shovel
he
flung
his
hand
that
way
and
cried
sir
cloudesley
shovel
a
very
gallant
man
as
he
stood
before
busby
tomb
the
knight
uttered
himself
again
after
the
same
manner
busby
a
great
man
he
whipped
my
grandfather
a
very
great
man
i
should
have
gone
to
him
myself
if
i
had
not
been
a
blockhead
a
very
great
man
we
were
immediately
conducted
to
the
little
chapel
on
the
right
hand
sir
roger
planting
himself
at
our
historian
elbow
was
very
attentive
to
everything
he
said
particularly
to
the
account
he
gave
us
of
the
lord
who
had
cut
off
the
king
of
morocco
head
among
several
other
figures
he
was
very
well
pleased
to
see
the
statesman
cecil
upon
his
knees
and
concluding
them
all
to
be
great
men
was
conducted
to
the
figure
which
represents
that
martyr
to
good
housewifery
who
died
by
the
prick
of
a
needle
upon
our
interpreter
telling
us
that
she
was
a
maid
of
honour
to
queen
elizabeth
the
knight
was
very
inquisitive
into
her
name
and
family
and
after
having
regarded
her
finger
for
some
time
i
wonder
says
he
that
sir
richard
baker
has
said
nothing
of
her
in
his
we
were
then
conveyed
to
the
two
coronation
chairs
where
my
old
friend
after
having
heard
that
the
stone
underneath
the
most
ancient
of
them
which
was

jacob
pillar
sat
himself
down
in
the
chair
and
looking
like
the
figure
of
an
old
gothic
king
asked
our
interpreter
what
authority
they
had
to
say
that
jacob
had
ever
been
in
scotland
the
fellow
instead
of
returning
him
an
answer
told
him
that
he
hoped
his
honour
would
pay
his
forfeit
i
could
observe
sir
roger
a
little
ruffled
upon
being
thus
trepanned
but
our
guide
not
insisting
upon
his
demand
the
knight
soon
recovered
his
good
humour
and
whispered
in
my
ear
that
if
will
wimble
were
with
us
and
saw
those
two
chairs
it
would
go
hard
but
he
would
get
a
out
of
one
or
the
other
of
them
sir
roger
in
the
next
place
laid
his
hand
upon
edward
the
sword
and
leaning
upon
the
pommel
of
it
gave
us
the
whole
history
of
the
black
prince
concluding
that
in
sir
richard
baker
opinion
edward
the
third
was
one
of
the
greatest
princes
that
ever
sat
upon
the
english
throne
we
were
then
shown
edward
the
confessor
tomb
upon
which
sir
roger
acquainted
us
that
he
was
the
first
who
touched
for
the
evil
and
afterwards
henry
the
fourth
upon
which
he
shook
his
head
and
told
us
there
was
fine
reading
in
the
casualties
of
that
reign
our
conductor
then
pointed
to
that
monument
where
there
is
the
figure
of
one
of
our
english
kings
without
an
head
and
upon
giving
us
to
know
that
the
head
which
was
of
beaten
silver
had
been
stolen
away
several
years
since
some
whig
i
warrant
you
says
sir
roger
you
ought
to
lock
up
your
kings
better
they
will
carry
off
the
body
too
if
you
take
care
the
glorious
names
of
henry
the
fifth
and
queen
elizabeth
gave
the
knight
great
opportunities
of
shining
and
of
doing
justice
to
sir
richard
baker
who
as
our
knight
observed
with
some
surprise
had
a
great
many
kings
in
him
whose
monuments
he
had
not
seen
in
the
abbey
for
my
own
part
i
could
not
but
be
pleased
to
see
the
knight
show
such
an
honest
passion
for
the
glory
of
his
country
and
such
a
respectful
gratitude
to
the
memory
of
its
princes
i
must
not
omit
that
the
benevolence
of
my
good
old
friend
which
flows
out
towards
every
one
he
converses
with
made
him
very
kind
to
our
interpreter
whom
he
looked
upon
as
an
extraordinary
man
for
which
reason
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
at
parting
telling
him
that
he
should
be
very
glad
to
see
him
at
his
lodgings
in
norfolk
buildings
and
talk
over
these
matters

my
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
when
we
last
met
together
at
the
club
told
me
that
he
had
a
great
mind
to
see
the
new
tragedy
with
me
assuring
me
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
not
been
at
a
play
these
twenty
years
the
last
i
saw
said
sir
roger
was
the
which
i
should
not
have
gone
to
neither
had
not
i
been
told
beforehand
that
it
was
a
good
church
of
england
comedy
he
then
proceeded
to
inquire
of
me
who
this
distressed
mother
was
and
upon
hearing
that
she
was
widow
he
told
me
that
her
husband
was
a
brave
man
and
that
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
he
had
read
his
life
at
the
end
of
the
dictionary
my
friend
asked
me
in
the
next
place
if
there
would
not
be
some
danger
in
coming
home
late
in
case
the
mohocks
should
be
abroad
i
assure
you
says
he
i
thought
i
had
fallen
into
their
hands
last
night
for
i
observed
two
or
three
lusty
black
men
that
followed
me
up
fleet
street
and
mended
their
pace
behind
me
in
proportion
as
i
put
on
to
get
away
from
them
you
must
know
continued
the
knight
with
a
smile
i
fancied
they
had
a
mind
to
me
for
i
remember
an
honest
gentleman
in
my
neighbourhood
who
was
served
such
a
trick
in
king
charles
the
second
time
for
which
reason
he
has
not
ventured
himself
in
town
ever
since
i
might
have
shown
them
very
good
sport
had
this
been
their
design
for
as
i
am
an
old
i
should
have
turned
and
dodged
and
have
played
them
a
thousand
tricks
they
had
never
seen
in
their
lives
before
sir
roger
added
that
if
these
gentlemen
had
any
such
intention
they
did
not
succeed
very
well
in
it
for
i
threw
them
out
says
he
at
the
end
of
norfolk
street
where
i
doubled
the
corner
and
got
shelter
in
my
lodgings
before
they
could
imagine
what
was
become
of
me
however
says
the
knight
if
captain
sentry
will
make
one
with
us
night
and
if
you
will
both
of
you
call
upon
me
about
four
that
we
may
be
at
the
house
before
it
is
full
i
will
have
my
coach
in
readiness
to
attend
you
for
john
tells
me
he
has
got
the
mended
the
captain
who
did
not
fail
to
meet
me
there
at
the
appointed
hour
bid
sir
roger
fear
nothing
for
that
he
had
put
on
the
same
sword
which
he
made
use
of
at
the
battle
of
steenkirk
sir
roger
servants
and
among
the
rest
my
old
friend
the
butler
had
i
found
provided
themselves
with
good
oaken
plants
to
attend
their
master
upon
this
occasion
when
we
had
placed
him
in
his
coach
with
myself
at
his
left
hand
the
captain
before
him
and
his
butler
at
the
head
of
his
footmen
in
the
rear
we
conveyed
him
in
safety
to
the
where
after
having
marched
up
the
entry
in
good
order
the
captain
and
i
went
in
with
him
and
seated
him
betwixt
us
in
the
pit
as
soon
as
the
house
was
full
and
the
candles
lighted
my
old
friend
stood
up
and
looked
about
him
with
that
pleasure
which
a
mind
seasoned
with
humanity
naturally
feels
in
itself
at
the
sight
of
a
multitude
of
people
who
seemed
pleased
with
one
another
and
partake
of
the
same
common
entertainment
i
could
not
but
fancy
to
myself
as
the
old
man
stood
up
in
the
middle
of
the
pit
that
he
made
a
very
proper
centre
to
a
tragic
audience
upon
the
entering
of
pyrrhus
the
knight
told
me
that
he
did
not
believe
the
king
of
france
himself
had
a
better
strut
i
was
indeed
very
attentive
to
my
old
friend
remarks
because
i
looked
upon
them
as
a
piece
of
natural
criticism
and
was
well
pleased
to
hear
him
at
the
conclusion
of
almost
every
scene
telling
me
that
he
could
not
imagine
how
the
play
would
end
one
while
he
appeared
much
concerned
for
andromache
and
a
little
while
after
as
much
for
hermione
and
was
extremely
puzzled
to
think
what
would
become
of
pyrrhus
when
sir
roger
saw
andromache
obstinate
refusal
to
her
importunities
he
whispered
me
in
the
ear
that
he
was
sure
she
would
never
have
him
to
which
he
added
with
a
more
than
ordinary
vehemence
you
can
not
imagine
sir
what
it
is
to
have
to
do
with
a
widow
upon
pyrrhus
his
threatening
afterwards
to
leave
her
the
knight
shook
his
head
and
muttered
to
himself
ay
do
if
you
can
this
part
dwelt
so
much
upon
my
friend
imagination
that
at
the
close
of
the
third
act
as
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
he
whispered
me
in
the
ear
these
widows
sir
are
the
most
perverse
creatures
in
the
world
but
pray
says
he
you
that
are
a
critic
is
the
play
according
to
your
dramatic
rules
as
you
call
them
should
your
people
in
tragedy
always
talk
to
be
understood
why
there
is
not
a
single
sentence
in
this
play
that
i
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
act
very
luckily
begun
before
i
had
time
to
give
the
old
gentleman
an
answer
well
says
the
knight
sitting
down
with
great
satisfaction
i
suppose
we
are
now
to
see
hector
ghost
he
then
renewed
his
attention
and
from
time
to
time
fell
a
praising
the
widow
he
made
indeed
a
little
mistake
as
to
one
of
her
pages
whom
at
his
first
entering
he
took
for
astyanax
but
quickly
set
himself
right
in
that
particular
though
at
the
same
time
he
owned
he
should
have
been
very
glad
to
have
seen
the
little
boy
who
says
he
must
needs
be
a
very
fine
child
by
the
account
that
is
given
of
him
upon
hermione
going
off
with
a
menace
to
pyrrhus
the
audience
gave
a
loud
clap
to
which
sir
roger
added
on
my
word
a
notable
young
baggage
as
there
was
a
very
remarkable
silence
and
stillness
in
the
audience
during
the
whole
action
it
was
natural
for
them
to
take
the
opportunity
of
the
intervals
between
the
acts
to
express
their
opinion
of
the
players
and
of
their
respective
parts
sir
roger
hearing
a
cluster
of
them
praise
orestes
struck
in
with
them
and
told
them
that
he
thought
his
friend
pylades
was
a
very
sensible
man
as
they
were
afterwards
applauding
pyrrhus
sir
roger
put
in
a
second
time
and
let
me
tell
you
says
he
though
he
speaks
but
little
i
like
the
old
fellow
in
whiskers
as
well
as
any
of
them
captain
sentry
seeing
two
or
three
wags
who
sat
near
us
lean
with
an
attentive
ear
towards
sir
roger
and
fearing
lest
they
should
smoke
the
knight
plucked
him
by
the
elbow
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
that
lasted
till
the
opening
of
the
fifth
act
the
knight
was
wonderfully
attentive
to
the
account
which
orestes
gives
of
pyrrhus
his
death
and
at
the
conclusion
of
it
told
me
it
was
such
a
bloody
piece
of
work
that
he
was
glad
it
was
not
done
upon
the
stage
seeing
afterwards
orestes
in
his
raving
fit
he
grew
more
than
ordinary
serious
and
took
occasion
to
moralise
in
his
way
upon
an
evil
conscience
adding
that
in
his
madness
looked
as
if
he
saw
as
we
were
the
first
that
came
into
the
house
so
we
were
the
last
that
went
out
of
it
being
resolved
to
have
a
clear
passage
for
our
old
friend
whom
we
did
not
care
to
venture
among
the
justling
of
the
crowd
sir
roger
went
out
fully
satisfied
with
his
entertainment
and
we
guarded
him
to
his
lodging
in
the
same
manner
that
we
brought
him
to
the
being
highly
pleased
for
my
own
part
not
only
with
the
performance
of
the
excellent
piece
which
had
been
presented
but
with
the
satisfaction
which
it
had
given
to
the
old
man

as
i
was
sitting
in

and
thinking
on
a
subject
for
my
next
i
heard
two
or
three
irregular
bounces
at
my
door
and
upon
the
opening
of
it
a
loud
cheerful
voice
inquiring
whether
the
philosopher
was
at
home
the
child
who
went
to
the
door
answered
very
innocently
that
he
did
not
lodge
there
i
immediately
recollected
that
it
was
my
good
friend
sir
roger
voice
and
that
i
had
promised
to
go
with
him
on
the
water
to
spring
garden
in
case
it
proved
a
good
evening
the
knight
put
me
in
mind
of
my
promise
from
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
but
told
me
that
if
i
was
speculating
he
would
stay
below
till
i
had
done
upon
my
coming
down
i
found
all
the
children
of
the
family
got
about
my
old
friend
and
my
landlady
herself
who
is
a
notable
prating
gossip
engaged
in
a
conference
with
him
being
mightily
pleased
with
his
stroking
her
little
boy
upon
the
head
and
bidding
him
be
a
good
child
and
mind
his
book
we
were
no
sooner
come
to
the
temple
stairs
but
we
were
surrounded
with
a
crowd
of
watermen
offering
us
their
respective
services
sir
roger
after
having
looked
about
him
very
attentively
spied
one
with
a
wooden
leg
and
immediately
gave
him
orders
to
get
his
boat
ready
as
we
were
walking
towards
it
you
must
know
says
sir
roger
i
never
make
use
of
any
body
to
row
me
that
has
not
either
lost
a
leg
or
an
arm
i
would
rather
bate
him
a
few
strokes
of
his
oar
than
not
employ
an
honest
man
that
has
been
wounded
in
the
queen
service
if
i
was
a
lord
or
a
bishop
and
kept
a
barge
i
would
not
put
a
fellow
in
my
livery
that
had
not
a

illustration
i
found
all
the
children
of

family
got
about
my
old
friend
my
old
friend
after
having
seated
himself
and
trimmed
the
boat
with
his
coachman
who
being
a
very
sober
man
always
serves
for
ballast
on
these
occasions
we
made
the
best
of
our
way
for
sir
roger
obliged
the
waterman
to
give
us
the
history
of
his
right
leg
and
hearing
that
he
had
left
it
at
la
hogue
with
many
particulars
which
passed
in
that
glorious
action
the
knight
in
the
triumph
of
his
heart
made
several
reflections
on
the
greatness
of
the
british
nation
as
that
one
englishman
could
beat
three
frenchmen
that
we
could
never
be
in
danger
of
popery
so
long
as
we
took
care
of
our
fleet
that
the
thames
was
the
noblest
river
in
europe
that
london
bridge
was
a
greater
piece
of
work
than
any
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
with
many
other
honest
prejudices
which
naturally
cleave
to
the
heart
of
a
true
englishman
after
some
short
pause
the
old
knight
turning
about
his
head
twice
or
thrice
to
take
a
survey
of
this
great
metropolis
bid
me
observe
how
thick
the
city
was
set
with
churches
and
that
there
was
scarce
a
single
steeple
on
this
side
temple
bar
a
most
heathenish
sight
says
sir
roger
there
is
no
religion
at
this
end
of
the
town
the
fifty
new
churches
will
very
much
mend
the
prospect
but
church
work
is
slow
church
work
is
slow
i
do
not
remember
i
have
anywhere
mentioned
in
sir
roger
character
his
custom
of
saluting
everybody
that
passes
by
him
with
a
or
a
this
the
old
man
does
out
of
the
overflowings
of
his
humanity
though
at
the
same
time
it
renders
him
so
popular
among
all
his
country
neighbours
that
it
is
thought
to
have
gone
a
good
way
in
making
him
once
or
twice
knight
of
the
shire
he
can
not
forbear
this
exercise
of
benevolence
even
in
town
when
he
meets
with
any
one
in
his
morning
or
evening
walk
it
broke
from
him
to
several
boats
that
passed
by
us
upon
the
water
but
to
the
knight
great
surprise
as
he
gave
the
to
two
or
three
young
fellows
a
little
before
our
landing
one
of
them
instead
of
returning
the
civility
asked
us
what
queer
old
put
we
had
in
the
boat
with
a
great
deal
of
the
like

roger
seemed
a
little
shocked
at
first
but
at
length
assuming
a
face
of
magistracy
told
us
that
if
he
were
a
middlesex
justice
he
would
make
such
vagrants
know
that
her
majesty
subjects
were
no
more
to
be
abused
by
water
than
by
land
we
were
now
arrived
at
spring
garden
which
is
exquisitely
pleasant
at
this
time
of
the
year
when
i
considered
the
fragrancy
of
the
walks
and
bowers
with
the
choirs
of
birds
that
sung
upon
the
trees
and
the
loose
tribe
of
people
that
walked
under
their
shades
i
could
not
but
look
upon
the
place
as
a
kind
of
mahometan
paradise
sir
roger
told
me
it
put
him
in
mind
of
a
little
coppice
by
his
house
in
the
country
which
his
chaplain
used
to
call
an
aviary
of
nightingales
you
must
understand
says
the
knight
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
pleases
a
man
in
love
so
much
as
your
nightingale
ah
spectator
the
many
moonlight
nights
that
i
have
walked
by
myself
and
thought
on
the
widow
by
the
music
of
the
nightingale
he
here
fetched
a
deep
sigh
and
was
falling
into
a
fit
of
musing
when
a
mask
who
came
behind
him
gave
him
a
gentle
tap
upon
the
shoulder
and
asked
him
if
he
would
drink
a
bottle
of
mead
with
her
but
the
knight
being
startled
at
so
unexpected
a
familiarity
and
displeased
to
be
interrupted
in
his
thoughts
of
the
widow
told
her
she
was
a
wanton
baggage
and
bid
her
go
about
her
business
we
concluded
our
walk
with
a
glass
of
burton
ale
and
a
slice
of
hung
beef
when
we
had
done
eating
ourselves
the
knight
called
a
waiter
to
him
and
bid
him
carry
the
remainder
to
the
waterman
that
had
but
one
leg
i
perceived
the
fellow
stared
upon
him
at
the
oddness
of
the
message
and
was
going
to
be
saucy
upon
which
i
ratified
the
commands
with
a
peremptory
look
footnotes
loud
knocks
we
should
now
say
at
vauxhall
ruminating
him
a
few
strokes
of
his
excuse

we
last
night

piece

ill
news
at
our
club
which
very
sensibly
afflicted
every
one
of
us
i
question
not

my
readers
themselves
will
be
troubled
at
the
hearing
of
it

keep

no

sir
roger
de
coverley
he
departed
this
life
at
his
house
in
the
country
after
a
few
weeks
sickness
sir
andrew
freeport
has
a
letter
from
one
of
his
correspondents
in
those
parts
that
informs
him
the
old
man
caught
a
cold
at
the
country
sessions
as
he
was
very
warmly
promoting
an
address
of
his
own
penning
in
which
he
succeeded
according
to
his
wishes
but
this
particular
comes
from
a
whig
justice
of
peace
who
was
always
sir
roger
enemy
and
antagonist
i
have
letters
both
from
the
chaplain
and
captain
sentry
which
mention
nothing
of
it
but
are
filled
with
many
particulars
to
the
honour
of
the
good
old
man
i
have
likewise
a
letter
from
the
butler
who
took
so
much
care
of
me
last
summer
when
i
was
at
the
knight
house
as
my
friend
the
butler
mentions
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
several
circumstances
the
others
have
passed
over
in
silence
i
shall
give
my
reader
a
copy
of
his
letter
without
any
alteration
or
diminution
honoured
sir
knowing
that
you
was
my
old
master
good
friend
i
could
not
forbear
sending
you
the
melancholy
news
of
his
death
which
has
afflicted
the
whole
country
as
well
as
his
poor
servants
who
loved
him
i
may
say
better
than
we
did
our
lives
i
am
afraid
he
caught
his
death
the
last
country
sessions
where
he
would
go
to
see
justice
done
to
a
poor
widow
woman
and
her
fatherless
children
that
had
been
wronged
by
a
neighbouring
gentleman
for
you
know
sir
my
good
master
was
always
the
poor
man
friend
upon
his
coming
home
the
first
complaint
he
made
was
that
he
had
lost
his
stomach
not
being
able
to
touch
a
sirloin
which
was
served
up
according
to
custom
and
you
know
he
used
to
take
great
delight
in
it
from
that
time
forward
he
grew
worse
and
worse
but
still
kept
a
good
heart
to
the
last
indeed
we
were
once
in
great
hope
of
his
recovery
upon
a
kind
message
that
was
sent
him
from
the
widow
lady
whom
he
had
made
love
to
the
forty
last
years
of
his
life
but
this
only
proved
a
lightning
before
death
he
has
bequeathed
to
this
lady
as
a
token
of
his
love
a
great
pearl
necklace
and
a
couple
of
silver
bracelets
set
with
jewels
which
belonged
to
my
good
old
lady
his
mother
he
has
bequeathed
the
fine
white
gelding
that
he
used
to
ride
upon
to
his
chaplain
because
he
thought
he
would
be
kind
to
him
and
has
left
you
all
his
books
he
has
moreover
bequeathed
to
the
chaplain
a
very
pretty
tenement
with
good
lands
about
it
it
being
a
very
cold
day
when
he
made
his
will
he
left
for
mourning
to
every
man
in
the
parish
a
great
frieze
coat
and
to
every
woman
a
black
it
was
a
most
moving
sight
to
see
him
take
leave
of
his
poor
servants
commending
us
all
for
our
fidelity
whilst
we
were
not
able
to
speak
a
word
for
weeping
as
we
most
of
us
are
grown
in
our
dear
master
service
he
has
left
us
pensions
and
legacies
which
we
may
live
very
comfortably
upon
the
remaining
part
of
our
days
he
has
bequeathed
a
great
deal
more
in
charity
which
is
not
yet
come
to
my
knowledge
and
it
is
peremptorily
said
in
the
parish
that
he
has
left
money
to
build
a
steeple
to
the
church
for
he
was
heard
to
say
some
time
ago
that
if
he
lived
two
years
longer
coverley
church
should
have
a
steeple
to
it
the
chaplain
tells
everybody
that
he
made
a
very
good
end
and
never
speaks
of
him
without
tears
he
was
buried
according
to
his
own
directions
among
the
family
of
the
coverleys
on
the
left
hand
of
his
father
sir
arthur
the
coffin
was
carried
by
six
of
his
tenants
and
the
pall
held
by
six
of
the
quorum
the
whole
parish
followed
the
corpse
with
heavy
hearts
and
in
their
mourning
suits
the
men
in
frieze
and
the
women
in
captain
sentry
my
master
nephew
has
taken
possession
of
the
and
the
whole
estate
when
my
old
master
saw
him
a
little
before
his
death
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
wished
him
joy
of
the
estate
which
was
falling
to
him
desiring
him
only
to
make
a
good
use
of
it
and
to
pay
the
several
legacies
and
the
gifts
of
charity
which
he
told
him
he
had
left
as
upon
the
estate
the
captain
truly
seems
a
courteous
man
though
he
says
but
little
he
makes
much
of
those
whom
my
master
loved
and
shows
great
kindnesses
to
the
old
that
you
know
my
poor
master
was
so
fond
of
it
would
have
gone
to
your
heart
to
have
heard
the
moans
the
dumb
creature
made
on
the
day
of
my
death
he
has
never
joyed
himself
since
no
more
has
any
of
us
it
was
the
melancholiest
day
for
the
poor
people
that
ever
happened
in
worcestershire
this
is
all
from
honoured
sir
your
most
sorrowful
servant
edward
biscuit
my
master
desired
some
weeks
before
he
died
that
a
book
which
comes
up
to
you
by
the
carrier
should
be
given
to
sir
andrew
freeport
in
his
name
this
letter
notwithstanding
the
poor
butler
manner
of
writing
it
gave
us
such
an
idea
of
our
good
old
friend
that
upon
the
reading
of
it
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
club
sir
andrew
opening
the
book
found
it
to
be
a
collection
of
acts
of
parliament
there
was
in
particular
the
act
of
uniformity
with
some
passages
in
it
marked
by
sir
roger
own
hand
sir
andrew
found
that
they
related
to
two
or
three
points
which
he
had
disputed
with
sir
roger
the
last
time
he
appeared
at
the
club
sir
andrew
who
would
have
been
merry
at
such
an
incident
on
another
occasion
at
the
sight
of
the
old
man
handwriting
burst
into
tears
and
put
the
book
into
his
pocket
captain
sentry
informs
me
that
the
knight
has
left
rings
and
mourning
for
every
one
in
the
club
