introduction
by
theodore
herzl
was
the
first
jew
who
projected
the
jewish
question
as
an
international
problem
the
jewish
state
written
fifty
years
ago
was
the
first
public
expression
in
a
modern
language
by
a
modern
jew
of
a
dynamic
conception
of
how
the
solution
of
the
problem
could
be
accelerated
and
the
ancient
jewish
hope
slumbering
in
jewish
memory
for
two
thousand
years
could
be
fulfilled
in
leo
pinsker
a
jewish
physician
of
odessa
disturbed
by
the
pogroms
of
made
a
keen
analysis
of
the
position
of
the
jews
declared
that
was
a
psychosis
and
incurable
that
the
cause
of
it
was
the
abnormal
condition
of
jewish
life
and
that
the
only
remedy
for
it
was
the
removal
of
the
cause
through
and
the
jewish
people
must
become
an
independent
nation
settled
on
the
soil
of
their
own
land
and
leading
the
life
of
a
normal
people
moses
hess
in
his
rome
and
jerusalem
classified
the
jewish
question
as
one
of
the
nationalist
struggles
inspired
by
the
french
revolution
perez
smolenskin
and
urged
the
revival
of
hebrew
and
the
resettlement
of
palestine
as
the
foundation
for
the
rebirth
of
the
jewish
people
herzl
was
unaware
of
the
existence
of
these
works
his
eyes
were
not
directed
to
the
problem
in
the
same
manner
when
he
wrote
the
jewish
state
he
was
a
journalist
living
in
paris
sending
his
letters
to
the
leading
newspaper
of
vienna
the
freie
and
writing
on
a
great
variety
of
subjects
he
was
led
to
see
jewish
life
as
a
phenomenon
in
a
changing
world
he
had
adapted
himself
to
a
worldly
outlook
on
all
life
through
his
efforts
the
jewish
problem
was
raised
to
the
higher
level
of
an
international
question
which
in
his
judgment
should
be
given
consideration
by
enlightened
statesmanship
he
was
inspired
to
give
his
pamphlet
a
title
that
arrested
attention
he
wrote
the
jewish
state
in
a
mood
of
restless
agitation
his
ideas
were
thrown
into
the
white
heat
of
a
spontaneous
revelation
what
was
revealed
dazzled
and
blinded
him
alex
bein
in
his
excellent
biography
gives
an
intriguing
description
drawn
from
diaries
of
how
the
jewish
state
was
born
it
was
the
revelation
of
a
mystic
vision
with
flashes
and
overtones
of
prophecy
this
is
what
bein
says
then
suddenly
the
storm
breaks
upon
him
the
clouds
open
the
thunder
rolls
the
lightning
flashes
about
him
a
thousand
impressions
beat
upon
him
at
the
same
time
a
gigantic
vision
he
can
not
think
he
is
unable
to
move
he
can
only
write
breathless
unreflecting
unable
to
control
himself
or
to
exercise
his
critical
faculties
lest
he
dam
the
eruption
he
dashes
down
his
thoughts
on
scraps
of
paper
walking
standing
lying
down
on
the
street
at
the
table
in
the
night
as
if
under
unceasing
command
so
furiously
did
the
cataract
of
his
thoughts
rush
through
him
that
he
thought
he
was
going
out
of
his
mind
he
was
not
working
out
the
idea
the
idea
was
working
him
out
it
would
have
been
an
hallucination
had
it
not
been
so
informed
by
reason
from
first
to
last
not
only
did
the
magic
title
evoke
a
widespread
interest
among
the
intellectuals
of
the
day
but
it
brought
jews
out
of
the
ghettos
and
made
them
conscious
of
their
origin
and
destiny
it
made
them
feel
that
there
was
a
world
that
might
be
won
for
their
cause
hitherto
never
communicated
to
strangers
through
herzl
jews
were
taught
not
to
fear
the
consequences
of
an
international
movement
to
demand
their
national
freedom
thereafter
with
freedom
they
were
to
speak
of
a
zionist
congress
of
national
funds
of
national
schools
of
a
flag
and
a
national
anthem
and
the
redemption
of
their
land
their
spirits
were
liberated
and
in
thought
they
no
longer
lived
in
ghettos
herzl
taught
them
not
to
hide
in
corners
at
the
first
congress
he
said
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
conspiracy
secret
intervention
or
indirect
methods
we
wish
to
put
the
question
in
the
arena
and
under
the
control
of
free
public
opinion
the
jews
were
to
be
active
factors
in
their
emancipation
and
if
they
wished
it
what
was
described
in
the
jewish
state
would
not
be
a
dream
but
a
reality
the
beginnings
of
the
jewish
renaissance
preceded
the
appearance
of
the
jewish
state
by
several
decades
in
every
section
of
russian
jewry
and
extending
to
wherever
the
jews
clung
to
their
hebraic
heritage
there
was
an
active
zionist
life
the
reborn
hebrew
was
becoming
an
influence
there
were
scores
of
hebrew
schools
and
academies
hebrew
journals
of
superior
quality
had
a
wide
circulation
ever
since
the
pogroms
of
the
ideas
of
pinsker
and
smolenskin
and
gordon
were
discussed
with
great
interest
and
deep
understanding
there
were
many
zionist
societies
in
russia
in
poland
in
rumania
in
galicia
and
even
in
the
united
states
in
the
jewish
state
herzl
alludes
to
the
language
of
the
jewish
state
and
passes
hebrew
by
as
a
manifestation
of
no
great
significance
he
has
a
poorer
opinion
of
yiddish
the
common
language
of
jews
which
he
regards
as
the
furtive
language
of
prisoners
this
was
obviously
an
oversight
with
the
advent
of
herzl
however
zionism
was
no
more
a
matter
of
domestic
concern
only
it
was
no
longer
internal
jewish
problem
only
not
a
theme
for
discussion
only
at
zionist
meetings
not
a
problem
to
heat
the
spirits
of
jewish
writers
the
problem
of
jewish
exile
now
occupied
a
place
on
the
agenda
of
international
affairs
herzl
was
not
so
distant
from
his
people
as
many
of
the
russian
zionists
at
first
surmised
he
was
familiar
with
the
social
of
austria
and
germany
he
knew
of
the
disabilities
of
the
jews
in
russia
there
are
many
references
in
his
feuilletons
to
matters
of
jewish
interest
he
had
read
an
book
written
by
eugen
d√ºhring
called
the
jewish
problem
as
a
problem
of
race
morals
and
culture
one
of
his
closest
friends
had
gone
to
brazil
for
a
jewish
committee
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
settling
jews
in
that
part
of
south
america
in
he
wrote
an
article
on
french
in
which
he
considered
the
solution
of
a
return
to
zion
and
seemed
to
reject
it
he
wrote
the
new
ghetto
two
years
before
the
jewish
state
appeared
he
was
present
at
the
trial
of
alfred
dreyfus
in
december
he
witnessed
the
degradation
of
dreyfus
and
heard
the
cries
of
down
with
the
jews
in
the
streets
of
paris
he
read
edouard
drumont
journal
la
france
juive
and
said
i
have
to
thank
drumont
for
much
of
the
freedom
of
my
present
conception
of
the
jewish
problem
while
he
was
in
paris
he
was
stirred
as
never
before
by
the
feeling
that
the
plight
of
the
jews
was
a
problem
which
would
have
to
have
the
cooperation
of
enlightened
statesmanship
what
excited
him
in
the
strangest
way
was
the
unaccountable
indifference
of
jews
themselves
to
what
seemed
to
him
the
menace
of
the
existing
situation
he
saw
the
jews
in
every
land
encircled
by
enemies
hostility
to
them
growing
with
the
increase
of
their
numbers
in
his
excitement
he
thought
first
of
jewish
philanthropists
he
sought
an
interview
with
baron
maurice
de
hirsch
in
may
he
planned
an
address
to
the
rothschilds
he
talked
of
his
ideas
to
friends
in
literary
circles
his
mind
was
obsessed
by
a
gigantic
problem
which
gave
him
no
rest
he
was
struggling
to
pierce
the
veils
of
revelation
he
saw
a
world
in
which
the
jewish
people
lacked
a
fulcrum
for
national
action
and
therefore
had
to
seek
to
create
it
through
beneficence
he
had
a
remarkably
resourceful
and
agile
imagination
he
weighed
ideas
balanced
them
discarded
them
reflected
reconsidered
tried
to
reconcile
contradictions
and
finally
came
to
what
seemed
to
him
at
the
moment
the
synthesis
of
the
issue
which
seemed
acceptable
to
reason
and
sentiment
obviously
the
jewish
state
was
not
a
dogmatic
finality
most
of
the
plans
for
settlement
and
migration
are
improvisations
the
pamphlet
was
not
a
rigid
plan
or
a
blueprint
it
was
not
a
description
of
a
utopia
although
some
parts
of
it
give
that
impression
it
had
an
indicated
destiny
but
was
not
bound
by
a
rigid
line
it
was
the
illumination
of
a
dynamic
thought
and
followed
the
light
with
the
hope
that
it
might
lead
to
fulfillment
there
was
room
for
detours
and
variations
it
was
to
be
rewritten
as
he
knew
not
by
its
author
but
by
the
jewish
people
on
their
way
to
freedom
in
fact
it
was
revised
from
the
moment
the
zionist
movement
was
organized
on
an
international
basis
the
society
of
jews
became
the
zionist
organization
with
its
statutes
its
procedures
its
public
excitement
and
controversies
the
jewish
company
became
the
bank
then
more
specifically
the
jewish
colonial
trust
and
later
the
bank
the
description
of
the
which
appears
in
the
final
chapter
of
the
pamphlet
was
never
referred
to
again
but
in
effect
it
was
incorporated
in
the
idea
of
a
state
its
legitimate
successor
is
the
jewish
agency
referred
to
in
the
mandate
for
palestine
he
was
first
led
by
the
idea
that
the
way
to
the
charter
was
through
the
sultan
and
that
the
sultan
would
be
influenced
by
kaiser
wilhelm
but
both
princes
failing
him
he
turned
to
england
and
joseph
chamberlain
and
came
to
the
uganda
proposal
this
was
herzl
one
political
success
although
the
project
was
in
effect
rejected
by
the
zionist
congress
but
this
encounter
with
england
was
a
precedent
which
led
to
much
speculation
in
zionist
circles
and
gave
a
turn
to
zionist
thought
away
from
germany
and
turkey
it
served
to
inspire
chaim
weizman
to
make
his
home
in
england
with
the
express
purpose
of
seeking
english
sympathy
for
the
zionist
ideal
the
successor
of
joseph
chamberlain
was
arthur
james
balfour
when
herzl
opened
door
zionism
had
an
easier
access
to
the
england
of
balfour
when
herzl
first
appeared
on
the
political
scene
he
thought
of
courtiers
and
statesmen
of
princes
and
kings
he
found
that
they
could
not
be
relied
upon
for
truth
or
stability
they
were
encircled
by
favorites
and
mercenaries
enormous
responsibilities
rested
upon
their
shoulders
but
they
seemed
to
behave
with
regard
to
these
responsibilities
as
if
they
were
gamblers
or
amateurs
herzl
soon
realized
that
these
were
frail
reeds
that
would
break
under
the
slightest
pressure
he
came
to
put
his
trust
in
the
jewish
people
the
only
real
source
of
strength
for
the
purpose
of
redemption
confidence
in
themselves
would
give
them
power
to
breach
their
prison
walls
his
aristocratic
republic
had
to
become
a
movement
of
democracy
only
in
the
jewish
state
will
you
find
reference
to
a
movement
based
upon
jews
who
endorse
a
fixed
program
and
then
become
members
under
the
discipline
of
leadership
when
herzl
faced
the
first
congress
he
saw
that
this
conception
of
zionism
was
foreign
to
the
nature
and
character
of
the
jewish
people
the
shekel
was
the
registry
of
a
name
it
led
the
way
to
the
elevation
of
the
individual
in
zionist
affairs
first
as
a
member
of
a
democratic
army
willing
the
fulfillment
and
then
settling
in
palestine
to
become
the
hands
that
built
the
homeland
arrayed
in
the
armor
of
democracy
the
zionist
movement
made
the
ideal
of
pinsker
live
in
the
soul
of
herzl
at
a
number
of
congresses
in
his
articles
in
die
welt
herzl
showed
how
that
idea
had
become
an
integral
part
of
his
life
although
his
first
thoughts
ran
in
quite
another
direction
but
his
analysis
of
and
how
to
approach
the
problem
remains
true
today
after
hitler
as
it
was
true
then
after
dreyfus
this
was
the
authentic
revelation
that
in
his
last
days
was
fixed
in
his
mind
the
homelessness
of
the
jewish
people
must
come
to
an
end
that
tragedy
is
a
world
problem
it
is
to
be
solved
by
world
statesmanship
in
cooperation
with
the
reawakened
jewish
people
it
is
to
be
solved
by
the
establishment
of
a
free
jewish
state
in
their
historic
homeland
herzl
manifested
his
utter
identification
with
the
destiny
of
his
own
people
at
the
uganda
congress
when
he
faced
the
rebellious
russian
zionists
spoke
words
of
consolation
to
them
and
gave
them
assurances
of
his
fealty
to
zion
he
died
a
few
months
later
the
jewish
state
was
not
regarded
by
herzl
as
a
piece
of
literature
it
was
a
political
document
it
was
to
serve
as
the
introduction
to
political
action
it
was
to
lead
to
the
conversion
of
leaders
in
political
life
it
was
to
win
converts
to
the
idea
of
a
jewish
state
although
a
shy
man
at
first
he
did
not
hesitate
to
make
his
way
through
the
corridors
of
the
great
and
suffer
the
humiliations
of
the
suppliant
through
that
remarkable
friend
and
christian
the
reverend
william
hechler
he
met
the
grand
duke
of
baden
he
made
the
rounds
of
german
statesmen
count
zu
eulenburg
foreign
minister
von
buelow
and
reichschancellor
hohenlohe
then
he
met
the
favorites
who
encircled
sultan
abdul
hamid
and
the
sultan
himself
he
placed
the
dramatic
personae
of
his
drama
on
the
stage
the
plan
involved
the
turkish
debt
the
german
interest
in
the
orient
it
involved
stimulating
the
russians
and
visiting
the
pope
at
first
his
political
activities
were
conducted
as
the
author
of
a
startling
pamphlet
then
as
the
leader
of
his
people
he
became
conscious
of
his
leadership
and
played
his
part
with
superb
dignity
he
had
ease
of
manner
and
correct
form
he
created
the
impression
of
a
regal
personality
his
noble
appearance
hid
his
hesitations
and
fears
with
the
sultan
he
played
the
most
remarkable
game
of
diplomacy
he
believed
that
once
a
mutual
interest
could
be
arrived
at
he
would
be
able
to
secure
the
funds
although
at
the
time
of
speaking
he
had
no
funds
at
all
adjusting
himself
to
the
wily
turk
he
had
to
change
and
diminish
his
demands
and
finally
when
he
was
dangerously
near
a
disclosure
he
was
saved
by
the
sultan
transferring
his
interest
to
the
french
and
obtaining
his
funds
from
them
with
kaiser
wilhelm
he
soon
appreciated
the
fact
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
great
theatrical
personality
who
spoke
of
plans
and
purpose
with
great
fire
but
had
no
courage
and
whose
convictions
melted
away
in
the
face
of
obstacles
the
world
herzl
dealt
with
has
passed
away
the
turkish
empire
now
occupies
a
small
part
of
the
near
east
its
former
provinces
have
now
become
sovereign
states
struggling
to
establish
harmony
between
themselves
and
feeding
on
their
animus
towards
the
jewish
people
returning
home
the
methods
of
diplomacy
have
changed
loudness
of
speech
is
no
longer
out
of
order
frankness
and
brutality
may
be
expected
at
any
international
gathering
it
is
now
felt
as
never
before
that
behind
political
leaders
rulers
princes
statesmen
the
people
are
advancing
and
soon
will
be
able
to
push
aside
those
who
make
of
the
relations
of
peoples
a
game
and
a
gamble
a
struggle
for
power
which
when
achieved
dissolves
into
the
nothingness
of
vanity
the
jewish
state
should
be
regarded
as
one
of
a
series
of
books
variations
on
the
same
theme
composed
by
the
same
author
the
first
was
the
new
ghetto
that
was
a
play
which
dealt
with
the
social
life
of
the
upper
class
of
jews
in
vienna
then
came
the
address
to
the
rothschilds
that
was
a
memorandum
which
contained
a
proposal
to
jewish
philanthropists
the
jewish
state
was
the
third
effort
of
an
agitated
mind
wavering
between
the
projection
of
a
utopia
or
a
thesis
and
containing
the
political
solution
of
the
jewish
problem
the
final
variant
of
the
original
theme
was
the
novel
altneuland
here
he
pictured
the
promised
land
as
it
might
become
twenty
years
after
the
beginning
of
the
zionist
movement
in
the
interims
he
played
on
the
exciting
stage
of
the
zionist
congresses
he
paid
court
to
princes
and
their
satellites
he
led
in
the
organization
of
the
jewish
colonial
trust
and
the
jewish
national
fund
he
delivered
political
addresses
and
engaged
in
political
controversy
he
began
the
writing
of
his
diaries
after
he
had
written
the
jewish
state
his
whole
personality
is
reflected
in
that
remarkable
book
there
you
see
his
ideas
in
the
process
of
becoming
clear
there
you
see
his
sharp
reactions
the
reflection
of
his
hopes
his
disappointments
his
shifts
from
untenable
positions
to
positions
possible
after
defeat
there
you
read
his
penetrating
analysis
of
the
figures
on
the
zionist
stage
upon
whom
he
had
to
rely
there
you
are
made
to
feel
his
doubts
his
dread
of
death
in
the
midst
of
life
he
felt
himself
encircled
by
the
shadow
of
death
there
you
found
the
explanation
of
his
great
haste
why
he
was
so
anxious
to
bring
a
measure
of
practical
reality
to
the
jewish
people
even
if
it
necessitated
a
detour
from
the
land
which
was
becoming
more
and
more
a
part
of
his
hopes
and
desires
the
diaries
are
unrestrained
and
unstudied
they
were
written
hurriedly
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
they
reveal
the
making
of
the
great
personality
who
gave
only
a
glimpse
of
himself
in
the
jewish
state
they
show
the
writer
evolving
as
the
hero
of
a
great
and
lasting
legend
the
pamphlet
is
one
of
the
chapters
in
the
story
of
his
struggle
to
achieve
in
eight
years
what
his
people
had
not
been
able
to
achieve
in
two
thousand
years
he
gave
his
life
to
write
it
a
biography
based
on
the
work
of
theodor
herzl
was
born
on
wednesday
may
in
the
city
of
budapest
almost
next
door
to
his
father
house
was
the
temple
to
this
house
of
worship
the
little
boy
went
regularly
with
his
father
on
sabbaths
and
holy
days
at
home
too
the
essentials
of
the
ritual
were
observed
one
ceremony
which
theodor
learned
in
childhood
remained
with
him
before
every
important
event
and
decision
he
sought
the
blessing
of
his
parents
even
stronger
than
these
impressions
however
was
the
influence
of
his
mother
her
education
had
been
german
through
and
through
there
was
not
a
day
on
which
she
did
not
slip
into
german
literature
especially
the
classics
the
jewish
world
not
alien
to
her
did
not
find
expression
through
her
her
conscious
efforts
were
all
directed
toward
implanting
the
german
cultural
heritage
in
her
children
of
even
deeper
significance
was
her
sympathetic
attitude
toward
the
pride
which
showed
early
in
her
son
and
her
skill
in
transferring
to
him
her
sense
of
form
of
bearing
of
tactfulness
and
of
simple
grace
at
about
the
age
of
twelve
he
read
in
a
german
book
about
the
whom
many
jews
still
awaited
and
who
would
come
riding
like
the
poorest
of
the
poor
on
an
ass
the
history
of
the
exodus
and
the
legend
of
the
liberation
by
the
ran
together
in
the
boy
mind
inspiring
in
him
the
theme
of
a
wonderful
story
which
he
sought
in
vain
to
put
into
literary
form
a
little
while
thereafter
herzl
had
the
following
dream
the
came
a
glorious
and
majestic
old
man
took
me
in
his
arms
and
swept
off
with
me
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
on
one
of
the
iridescent
clouds
we
encountered
the
figure
of
moses
the
features
were
those
familiar
to
me
out
of
my
childhood
in
the
statue
by
michelangelo
the
messiah
called
to
moses
it
is
for
this
child
that
i
have
prayed
but
to
me
he
said
go
declare
to
the
jews
that
i
shall
come
soon
and
perform
great
wonders
and
great
deeds
for
my
people
and
for
the
whole
world
it
may
be
to
this
period
of
his
of
reawakened
jewish
sensitivity
of
heightened
responsiveness
to
the
expectations
of
his
elders
of
resurgent
interest
in
jewish
historical
studies
it
may
be
to
this
period
that
the
dream
of
a
dedicated
life
belonged
it
is
almost
certain
too
that
for
the
great
event
of
the
the
old
grandfather
of
semlin
came
to
pest
about
this
time
again
alkalai
that
early
zionist
passed
through
vienna
and
budapest
on
his
final
journey
to
palestine
whether
or
not
each
one
of
these
circumstances
had
a
direct
effect
on
the
boy
the
whole
complex
surrounds
his
with
the
suggestion
of
the
mission
of
his
life
and
certainly
occasion
was
given
for
the
awakening
in
him
of
the
feeling
of
dedication
to
a
great
enterprise
the
attention
energy
and
time
which
herzl
devoted
to
literature
at
fifteen
his
absorption
in
himself
his
activity
in
the
school
literary
society
meant
of
course
so
much
less
given
to
his
school
work
he
found
no
time
at
all
for
science
jewish
questions
likewise
disappeared
from
his
interests
he
was
completely
absorbed
by
german
literary
culture
this
is
all
the
more
astonishing
when
we
reflect
that
continued
to
increase
steadily
as
a
grown
man
herzl
could
recall
that
one
of
his
teachers
in
defining
the
word
heathen
had
said
such
as
idolators
mohammedans
and
jews
whether
it
was
this
incident
as
the
memory
of
the
grown
man
always
insisted
which
enraged
him
beyond
endurance
or
the
increasingly
bad
school
reports
or
both
circumstances
together
the
fact
remains
that
on
february
herzl
left
the
technical
school
at
sixteen
to
eighteen
in
high
school
he
struggled
to
define
the
basic
principles
of
various
literary
art
forms
in
order
that
he
might
see
more
clearly
what
he
himself
wanted
to
say
he
took
an
active
and
eager
part
in
the
work
of
the
german
society
created
by
the
students
of
his
school
the
jewish
world
whose
inferior
position
always
wounded
his
pride
and
whose
obstinate
separatism
seemed
to
him
utterly
meaningless
drifted
further
and
further
out
of
his
mind
at
eighteen
after
the
sudden
death
of
his
only
sister
the
family
moved
to
vienna
where
herzl
entered
the
university
as
a
law
student
herzl
who
accounted
himself
a
liberal
and
an
austrian
patriot
plunged
eagerly
into
the
activities
of
a
large
student
cultural
association
attended
its
discussions
and
directed
its
literary
evenings
he
had
occasion
there
to
deride
certain
jewish
fellow
members
who
in
his
view
displayed
an
excessive
eagerness
in
their
loyalty
to
various
movements
this
was
the
extent
to
which
in
these
days
he
occupied
himself
with
the
jewish
question
at
least
externally
he
concerned
himself
little
or
not
at
all
with
the
official
jewish
world
which
was
seeking
to
submerge
itself
in
the
surrounding
world
he
seldom
visited
the
synagogue
he
was
an
omnivorous
reader
his
extraordinary
knowledge
of
books
was
evident
in
his
conversation
for
he
liked
to
adorn
his
speech
with
quotations
which
came
readily
to
his
memory
herzl
read
eugen
d√ºhring
book
as
a
problem
of
race
morals
and
the
first
and
most
important
effort
to
find
a
scientific
philosophic
biologic
and
historical
basis
for
the
which
was
sweeping
through
europe
in
those
days
d√ºhring
saw
the
jewish
question
as
a
purely
racial
question
and
for
him
the
jewish
race
was
without
any
worth
whatsoever
those
peoples
which
out
of
a
false
sentiment
of
humanity
had
permitted
the
jews
to
live
among
them
with
equal
and
sometimes
even
with
superior
rights
had
to
be
liberated
from
the
harmful
intruder
had
to
be
the
reading
of
this
book
had
the
effect
upon
him
of
a
blow
between
the
eyes
the
observations
set
down
in
his
diary
burn
with
indignation
an
infamous
book
if
d√ºhring
who
unites
so
much
undeniable
intelligence
with
so
much
universality
of
knowledge
can
write
like
this
what
are
we
to
expect
from
the
ignorant
masses
this
passionate
reaction
to
d√ºhring
book
shows
us
how
deeply
he
had
been
moved
and
how
fearfully
he
had
been
shaken
in
his
belief
that
the
jewish
question
was
on
the
point
of
disappearing
we
shall
find
echoes
of
this
experience
in
the
pages
of
the
for
the
time
being
however
he
shrank
from
the
logical
consequences
of
his
reactions
his
inner
pride
began
to
build
itself
up
the
more
immediate
reaction
was
undoubtedly
a
sharpened
perception
and
evaluation
of
his
in
the
fraternity
herzl
had
joined
and
been
active
in
a
duelling
fraternity
here
too
was
breaking
through
student
after
student
expressed
himself
favorably
toward
the
speeches
of
schoenerer
who
was
making
a
special
effort
to
win
over
the
universities
in
the
fraternity
debates
herzl
expressed
himself
sharply
against
any
open
or
covert
manifestation
of
such
sympathy
but
he
was
already
known
for
the
sharpness
of
his
tongue
and
the
individuality
of
his
views
thus
he
won
to
himself
neither
the
few
who
belonged
to
the
fraternity
nor
the
mass
of
the
germanic
students
he
had
learned
from
newspaper
reports
that
the
wagner
memorial
meeting
in
which
his
fraternity
had
taken
a
part
had
been
transformed
into
an
demonstration
his
fraternity
had
therefore
identified
itself
with
a
movement
which
he
as
a
believer
in
liberty
was
bound
to
condemn
even
if
he
had
not
been
a
jew
it
is
pretty
clear
that
handicapped
as
i
am
by
my
semitism
the
word
was
not
yet
known
at
the
time
of
my
entry
i
would
today
refrain
from
seeking
a
membership
which
would
indeed
probably
be
refused
me
it
must
also
be
clear
to
every
decent
person
that
under
these
circumstances
i
can
not
wish
to
retain
my
membership
herzl
withdrew
from
the
organization
on
july
herzl
was
admitted
to
the
bar
in
vienna
his
student
days
were
over
a
new
era
opened
for
him
with
its
challenge
to
prove
whether
or
not
there
was
something
in
him
to
establish
and
proclaim
to
the
world
in
august
he
entered
on
his
law
practice
in
the
service
of
the
state
and
was
soon
transferred
to
the
court
of
salzburg
though
he
may
at
that
time
have
been
so
far
from
judaism
that
only
pride
and
a
decent
respect
for
the
feelings
of
his
parents
stood
between
him
and
baptism
he
could
not
help
perceiving
that
as
a
jew
he
would
find
the
higher
levels
of
the
civil
service
hierarchy
closed
to
him
on
august
he
withdrew
from
the
service
determined
to
seek
fame
and
fortune
as
a
writer
brimming
with
hope
he
set
out
on
a
journey
which
was
to
be
the
introduction
to
his
literary
life
he
visited
belgium
and
holland
and
in
berlin
made
valuable
connections
and
became
a
regular
contributor
to
several
important
newspapers
thus
the
range
of
his
connections
and
relationships
widened
from
year
to
year
and
when
he
travelled
again
it
was
an
audience
that
waited
for
his
impressions
and
observations
in
a
book
of
reprinted
feuilletons
of
herzl
which
appeared
in
the
first
years
of
his
success
as
a
journalist
a
total
of
seven
or
eight
lines
is
devoted
to
jews
his
impressions
of
the
ghetto
in
rome
what
a
steaming
in
the
air
what
a
street
countless
open
doors
and
windows
thronged
with
innumerable
pallid
and
faces
the
ghetto
with
what
base
and
persistent
hatred
these
unfortunates
have
been
persecuted
for
the
sole
crime
of
faithfulness
to
their
religion
travelled
a
long
way
since
those
times
nowadays
the
jew
is
despised
only
for
having
a
crooked
nose
or
for
being
a
plutocrat
even
when
he
happens
to
be
a
pauper
pity
and
bitterness
abound
in
these
lines
but
they
are
written
by
a
detached
spectator
he
did
not
know
how
much
of
the
jew
there
was
in
him
even
in
this
feeling
of
remoteness
from
a
world
which
offered
him
not
living
reality
but
folly
by
herzl
had
achieved
great
success
as
a
dramatist
and
as
a
journalist
his
plays
had
been
performed
on
the
stage
of
the
leading
theatre
of
vienna
and
to
cap
the
climax
came
an
appointment
to
the
staff
of
the
freie
one
of
the
most
distinguished
papers
on
the
continent
early
in
october
he
received
a
telegram
from
the
freie
asking
whether
he
would
accept
the
post
of
paris
correspondent
he
replied
at
once
in
the
affirmative
and
proceeded
to
the
french
capital
at
the
end
of
the
same
month
he
wrote
to
his
parents
the
position
of
paris
correspondent
is
the
springboard
to
great
things
and
i
shall
achieve
them
to
your
great
joy
my
dear
beloved
parents
herzl
sustained
successfully
the
comparison
with
his
great
models
and
predecessors
in
style
as
well
as
in
substance
his
reports
and
articles
were
masterpieces
of
their
kind
he
came
to
his
task
with
the
equipment
of
a
perfect
feuilletonist
his
style
was
polished
and
musical
he
possessed
in
an
exceptional
degree
the
capacity
to
describe
natural
scenery
in
a
few
fine
clear
strokes
and
of
hinting
at
rather
than
of
reproducing
a
mood
with
a
minimum
of
language
everything
was
there
background
mood
and
development
of
action
in
plastic
balance
it
was
only
now
when
a
great
opportunity
provoked
him
to
the
highest
effort
that
all
the
lessons
of
the
years
of
his
apprenticeship
built
up
a
perfection
he
threw
himself
seriously
and
diligently
into
the
journalistic
craft
he
observed
with
close
attention
all
that
went
on
about
him
and
listened
with
sharpened
ears
but
the
moment
had
not
yet
come
for
the
unveiling
of
a
mission
within
him
he
was
on
the
way
the
process
of
preparation
had
begun
how
in
this
mood
of
his
could
he
possibly
have
avoided
clashing
with
the
jewish
question
as
far
back
as
the
time
of
his
spanish
journey
when
he
had
sought
healing
from
his
domestic
and
spiritual
torments
the
question
had
presented
itself
to
him
and
had
cried
for
artistic
expression
his
call
to
paris
had
been
a
welcome
pretext
perhaps
putting
off
the
writing
of
his
jewish
novel
the
more
so
as
he
probably
was
not
ripe
enough
for
such
an
undertaking
now
that
he
was
in
paris
where
his
eyes
were
opened
to
the
full
range
of
the
social
process
he
began
to
draw
nearer
in
spirit
to
his
and
to
look
upon
them
more
warmly
and
with
less
inhibition
he
found
them
as
difficult
aesthetically
as
before
but
he
tried
hard
to
grasp
the
essence
of
their
character
and
substance
and
to
judge
them
without
prejudice
when
herzl
arrived
in
paris
had
not
in
spite
of
drumont
exertions
and
in
spite
of
his
paper
libre
founded
in
achieved
the
dimensions
of
a
genuine
movement
nor
was
it
destined
to
become
one
in
the
german
sense
but
it
served
as
the
focus
for
all
kinds
of
discontents
and
resentments
it
attracted
certain
serious
critical
spirits
too
its
influence
grew
from
day
to
day
and
the
position
of
the
jews
became
increasingly
uncomfortable
herzl
contact
with
dated
back
to
his
student
days
when
it
had
first
taken
on
the
form
of
a
social
political
movement
he
had
been
aware
of
it
as
a
writer
though
the
contact
had
never
ripened
into
a
serious
inner
struggle
or
compelled
him
to
give
utterance
to
it
now
he
read
drumont
as
he
had
read
d√ºhring
the
impression
was
again
a
profound
one
what
moved
him
most
in
the
work
was
the
totality
of
a
world
picture
based
on
a
considered
hostility
to
the
jews
a
trial
was
in
progress
in
the
town
of
xanten
in
the
rhineland
on
august
herzl
dealing
with
this
subject
as
with
all
other
subjects
of
public
interest
summed
up
the
general
situation
in
a
long
report
entitled
french
by
now
herzl
was
no
longer
content
with
a
simple
acceptance
of
the
facts
he
was
looking
for
the
deeper
significance
of
the
universal
enmity
directed
against
the
jews
for
the
world
it
is
a
lightning
conductor
but
so
far
it
was
only
a
flash
of
insight
which
ended
in
nothing
more
than
a
literary
paradox
however
from
now
on
it
gave
him
no
peace
at
the
turn
of
the
year
there
came
a
sharp
clarification
in
his
ideas
he
had
followed
closely
the
evasive
debates
in
the
austrian
reichstag
debates
which
forever
dodged
the
reality
by
turning
the
question
into
one
of
religion
it
is
no
longer
and
it
has
not
been
for
a
long
time
a
theological
matter
it
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
religion
and
conscience
declared
herzl
what
is
more
everyone
knows
it
the
jewish
question
is
neither
nationalistic
nor
religious
it
is
a
social
question
then
came
the
summer
and
at
its
close
herzl
took
a
much
needed
vacation
he
spent
the
month
of
september
in
baden
near
vienna
in
the
company
of
his
on
the
freie
ludwig
speidel
herzl
has
left
a
record
of
their
conversation
what
he
gave
speidel
was
more
or
less
what
he
had
felt
many
years
before
after
his
reading
of
d√ºhring
he
admitted
the
substance
of
the
accusation
which
linked
the
jew
with
money
he
defended
the
jew
as
the
victim
of
a
long
historic
process
for
which
the
jew
was
not
responsible
it
is
not
our
fault
not
the
fault
of
the
jews
that
we
find
ourselves
forced
into
the
role
of
alien
bodies
in
the
midst
of
various
nations
the
ghetto
which
was
not
of
our
making
bred
in
us
certain
qualities
our
original
character
can
not
have
been
other
than
magnificent
and
proud
we
were
men
who
knew
how
to
face
war
and
how
to
defend
the
state
had
we
not
started
out
with
such
gifts
how
could
we
have
survived
two
thousand
years
of
unrelenting
persecution
at
that
time
herzl
came
across
the
zionist
solution
and
definitely
rejected
it
discussing
the
novel
de
by
dumas
the
younger
he
says
of
one
of
its
characters
the
good
jew
daniel
wants
to
rediscover
the
homeland
of
his
race
and
gather
his
scattered
brothers
into
it
but
a
man
like
daniel
would
surely
know
that
the
historic
homeland
of
the
jews
no
longer
has
any
value
for
them
it
is
childish
to
go
in
search
of
the
geographic
location
of
this
homeland
and
if
the
jews
really
home
one
day
they
would
discover
on
the
next
day
that
they
do
not
belong
together
for
centuries
they
have
been
rooted
in
diverse
nationalisms
they
differ
from
each
other
group
by
group
the
only
thing
they
have
in
common
is
the
pressure
which
holds
them
together
all
humiliated
peoples
have
jewish
characteristics
and
as
soon
as
the
pressure
is
removed
they
react
like
liberated
men
the
inner
apotheosis
was
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
for
herzl
in
october
herzl
was
in
the
studio
of
the
sculptor
samuel
friedrich
beer
who
was
making
a
bust
of
him
the
conversation
turned
to
the
jewish
question
and
to
the
growth
of
the
movement
in
vienna
the
hometown
of
both
herzl
and
beer
it
was
useless
for
the
jew
to
turn
artist
and
to
dissociate
himself
from
money
said
herzl
the
blot
sticks
we
ca
break
away
from
the
ghetto
a
great
excitement
seized
herzl
and
he
left
the
atelier
and
on
the
way
home
the
inspiration
came
on
him
like
a
hammerblow
what
was
it
the
complete
outline
of
a
play
like
a
block
of
basalt
with
this
play
herzl
completed
his
inner
return
to
his
people
until
then
with
all
his
emotional
involvement
in
the
question
he
had
stood
outside
it
as
the
observer
the
student
the
clarifier
or
even
the
defender
he
had
provided
the
background
for
the
problem
he
had
diagnosed
it
and
given
the
prognosis
for
the
future
now
he
was
immersed
in
it
and
identified
with
it
he
had
become
its
spokesman
and
attorney
as
he
was
spokesman
and
attorney
for
other
victims
of
injustice
it
was
no
accident
that
the
hero
of
the
play
was
a
lawyer
by
vocation
and
avocation
for
the
hero
was
herzl
himself
and
the
transformation
which
unfolded
in
jacob
samuel
was
the
transformation
which
was
unfolding
in
theodore
herzl
he
belongs
utterly
to
the
jews
it
is
for
them
that
he
fights
and
dying
he
still
sees
himself
as
the
fighter
for
their
future
what
future
jacob
samuel
foresaw
for
the
jews
in
his
dying
moments
remained
unclear
it
would
appear
that
herzl
himself
still
believed
that
a
deepening
of
mutual
understanding
between
jews
and
might
bring
the
solution
but
herzl
had
travelled
so
much
further
by
this
time
that
he
could
not
have
in
mind
the
reconciliation
which
would
come
by
the
capitulation
of
baptism
indeed
the
play
emphasizes
as
a
first
prerequisite
in
human
relations
the
element
of
if
you
become
untrue
to
yourself
says
the
clever
mother
to
the
son
in
the
play
you
complain
if
others
become
untrue
to
you
it
was
like
a
fresh
wind
blowing
suddenly
through
the
choking
atmosphere
of
a
lightless
room
it
was
a
new
attitude
decent
pride
it
called
for
a
frightful
effort
to
descend
from
the
intoxicating
heights
of
creativity
to
the
ordinary
round
of
work
for
weeks
now
his
regular
employment
had
filled
herzl
with
revulsion
the
first
reports
of
the
dreyfus
trial
which
appeared
while
he
was
working
on
his
therefore
made
no
particular
impression
on
him
it
looked
like
a
sordid
espionage
affair
in
which
a
foreign
power
before
long
it
was
revealed
that
the
foreign
power
was
germany
acting
through
major
von
schwartzkoppen
had
been
buying
up
through
its
agent
secret
documents
of
the
french
general
staff
an
officer
by
the
name
of
alfred
dreyfus
was
named
as
the
culprit
and
no
one
had
reason
to
doubt
that
he
was
guilty
even
though
drumont
was
exploiting
the
fact
that
the
man
was
a
jew
but
after
the
degradation
of
dreyfus
herzl
became
more
and
more
convinced
of
his
innocence
a
jew
who
as
an
officer
on
the
general
staff
has
before
him
an
honorable
career
can
not
commit
such
a
crime
the
jews
who
have
so
long
been
condemned
to
a
state
of
civic
dishonor
have
as
a
result
developed
an
almost
pathological
hunger
for
honor
and
a
jewish
officer
is
in
this
respect
specifically
jewish
the
dreyfus
case
he
wrote
in
embodies
more
than
a
judicial
error
it
embodies
the
desire
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
french
to
condemn
a
jew
and
to
condemn
all
jews
in
this
one
jew
death
to
the
jews
howled
the
mob
as
the
decorations
were
being
ripped
from
the
captain
coat
where
in
france
in
republican
modern
civilized
france
a
hundred
years
after
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
the
french
people
or
at
any
rate
the
greater
part
of
the
french
people
does
not
want
to
extend
the
rights
of
man
to
jews
the
edict
of
the
great
revolution
had
been
revoked
illumined
thus
in
retrospect
the
curious
excitement
which
gripped
herzl
on
that
occasion
takes
on
a
special
significance
until
that
time
most
of
us
believed
that
the
solution
of
the
jewish
question
was
to
be
patiently
waited
for
as
part
of
the
general
development
of
mankind
but
when
a
people
which
in
every
other
respect
is
so
progressive
and
so
highly
civilized
can
take
such
a
turn
what
are
we
to
expect
from
other
peoples
which
have
not
even
attained
the
level
which
france
attained
a
hundred
years
ago
in
that
fateful
moment
when
he
heard
the
howling
of
the
mob
outside
the
gates
of
the
the
realization
flashed
upon
herzl
that
was
in
the
heart
of
the
people
so
deep
indeed
that
it
was
impossible
to
hope
for
its
disappearance
within
a
measurable
period
of
time
precisely
because
he
was
so
sensitive
to
his
honor
as
a
jew
precisely
because
he
had
proclaimed
in
the
the
ideal
of
human
reconciliation
and
had
taken
the
ultimate
decision
to
stand
by
his
jewishness
the
ghastly
spectacle
of
that
winter
morning
must
have
shaken
him
to
the
depths
of
his
being
it
was
as
if
the
ground
had
been
cut
away
from
under
his
feet
in
this
sense
herzl
could
say
later
that
the
dreyfus
affair
had
made
him
a
zionist
he
saw
all
about
him
the
ever
fiercer
light
of
a
blazing
in
the
french
chamber
of
deputies
the
deputy
denis
made
an
interpellation
on
the
influence
of
the
jews
in
the
political
administration
of
the
country
in
vienna
a
jewish
member
of
the
reichstag
rose
to
speak
and
was
howled
down
on
april
were
held
the
municipal
elections
of
vienna
and
there
was
an
enormous
increase
in
the
number
of
aldermen
changing
plans
passed
tumultuously
through
his
mind
he
wanted
to
write
a
book
on
the
condition
of
the
jews
consisting
of
reports
on
all
the
important
jewish
colonization
enterprises
in
russia
galicia
hungary
bohemia
the
orient
and
those
more
recently
founded
in
palestine
about
which
he
had
heard
from
a
relative
alphonse
daudet
the
famous
french
author
with
whom
he
had
discussed
the
whole
matter
felt
that
herzl
ought
to
write
a
novel
it
would
carry
further
than
a
play
look
at
tom
he
returned
to
his
former
plan
of
a
jewish
novel
which
he
had
abandoned
when
he
was
called
to
his
assignment
on
the
freie
in
paris
his
friend
kana
the
suicide
was
no
longer
to
be
the
central
figure
he
was
instead
to
be
the
weaker
one
the
beloved
friend
of
the
hero
and
would
take
his
own
life
after
a
series
of
misfortunes
while
the
promised
land
was
being
discovered
or
rather
founded
when
the
hero
aboard
the
ship
which
was
taking
him
to
the
promised
land
would
receive
the
moving
farewell
letter
of
his
friend
his
first
reaction
after
his
horror
would
be
one
of
rage
idiot
fool
miserable
hopeless
weakling
a
life
lost
which
belonged
to
us
we
can
see
the
zionist
idea
arising
its
outlines
are
still
indefinite
but
the
decisive
idea
is
clearly
visible
only
by
migration
can
this
upright
human
type
be
given
its
chance
to
emerge
in
new
jacob
samuel
is
a
hero
because
he
knows
how
to
choose
an
honorable
death
now
the
death
of
a
useful
man
is
criminally
wasteful
for
there
are
great
tasks
to
be
undertaken
in
essence
it
is
the
act
and
not
the
word
that
confronts
us
what
last
impulse
it
was
that
actually
carried
herzl
from
the
word
to
the
act
it
will
be
difficult
to
tell
he
himself
could
not
have
given
the
answer
little
things
may
play
a
dramatic
role
not
less
effectively
than
great
ones
when
a
man
is
so
charged
with
purpose
as
herzl
then
was
in
the
early
days
of
may
herzl
addressed
to
baron
de
hirsch
the
sponsor
of
jewish
colonization
in
argentina
the
letter
which
opens
his
jewish
political
career
his
request
for
an
interview
was
granted
herzl
prepared
an
outline
of
his
position
in
notes
lest
he
omit
something
important
during
their
conversation
in
these
notes
he
writes
if
the
jews
are
to
be
transformed
into
men
of
character
in
a
reasonable
period
of
time
say
ten
or
twenty
years
or
even
forty
the
interval
needed
by
moses
it
can
not
be
done
without
migration
who
is
going
to
decide
whether
conditions
are
bad
enough
today
to
warrant
our
migration
and
whether
the
situation
is
hopeless
and
the
congress
which
you
hirsch
have
convened
for
the
first
of
august
in
a
hotel
in
switzerland
you
will
preside
over
this
congress
of
notables
your
call
will
be
heard
and
answered
in
every
part
of
the
world
and
what
will
be
the
message
given
to
the
men
assembled
are
pariahs
you
must
forever
tremble
at
the
thought
that
you
are
about
to
be
deprived
of
your
rights
and
stripped
of
your
possessions
you
will
be
insulted
when
you
walk
in
the
street
if
you
are
poor
you
suffer
doubly
if
you
are
rich
you
must
conceal
the
fact
you
are
not
admitted
to
any
honorable
calling
and
if
you
deal
in
money
you
are
made
the
special
focus
of
contempt
the
situation
will
not
change
for
the
better
but
rather
for
the
worse
there
is
only
way
out
into
the
promised
land
where
the
promised
land
was
to
be
located
how
it
was
to
be
acquired
is
not
yet
mentioned
herzl
does
not
seem
to
have
thought
this
question
of
decisive
significance
it
was
a
scientific
matter
it
was
the
organization
of
the
migration
which
held
his
attention
the
political
preparations
among
the
powers
the
preliminary
changes
to
be
brought
about
among
the
masses
by
training
by
tremendous
propaganda
the
popularization
of
the
idea
through
newspapers
books
pamphlets
lectures
pictures
songs
on
the
day
of
his
conversation
with
baron
de
hirsch
herzl
wrote
him
a
long
letter
in
which
he
sought
to
supplement
the
information
and
impressions
which
had
been
the
result
of
the
meeting
please
believe
me
the
political
life
of
an
entire
people
particularly
when
that
people
is
scattered
throughout
the
entire
world
can
be
set
in
motion
only
with
imponderables
floating
high
in
the
air
do
you
know
what
the
german
reich
sprang
from
from
dreams
songs
fantasies
and
bands
worn
by
students
and
that
in
a
brief
period
of
time
what
you
do
not
understand
imponderables
and
what
is
religion
bethink
yourself
what
the
jews
have
endured
for
two
thousand
years
for
the
sake
of
this
fantasy
the
exodus
to
the
promised
land
presents
itself
as
a
tremendous
enterprise
in
transportation
unparalleled
in
the
modern
world
what
transportation
it
is
a
complex
of
all
human
enterprises
which
we
shall
fit
into
each
other
like
and
in
the
very
first
stages
of
the
enterprise
we
shall
find
employment
for
the
ambitious
younger
masses
of
our
people
all
the
engineers
architects
technologists
chemists
doctors
and
lawyers
those
who
have
emerged
in
the
last
thirty
years
from
the
ghetto
and
who
have
been
moved
by
the
faith
that
they
can
win
their
bread
and
a
little
honor
outside
the
framework
of
our
jewish
business
futilities
today
they
must
be
filled
with
despair
they
constitute
the
foundation
of
a
frightful
proletariat
but
it
is
to
these
that
all
my
love
belongs
and
i
am
just
as
set
on
increasing
their
number
as
you
are
set
on
diminishing
it
it
is
in
them
that
i
perceive
the
latent
power
of
the
jewish
people
in
brief
my
kind
in
this
letter
of
june
herzl
for
the
first
time
imparted
his
new
jewish
policy
to
a
stranger
the
writing
down
of
his
views
as
well
as
his
conversation
on
the
subject
had
had
a
stronger
effect
on
himself
than
on
hirsch
he
had
obtained
a
clear
vision
of
the
new
and
revolutionary
character
of
his
proposals
on
the
same
day
or
shortly
thereafter
he
began
a
diary
under
the
title
of
jewish
for
some
time
now
i
have
been
engaged
upon
a
work
of
indescribable
greatness
i
do
not
know
yet
whether
i
shall
carry
it
through
it
has
assumed
the
aspect
of
some
mighty
dream
but
days
and
weeks
have
passed
since
it
has
filled
me
utterly
it
has
overflown
into
my
unconscious
self
it
accompanies
me
wherever
i
go
it
broods
above
all
my
commonplace
conversation
it
peeps
over
my
shoulder
at
the
comical
little
journalistic
work
which
i
must
carry
out
it
disturbs
and
intoxicates
me
then
suddenly
the
storm
breaks
upon
him
the
clouds
open
the
thunder
rolls
and
the
lightning
flashes
about
him
a
thousand
impressions
beat
upon
him
simultaneously
a
gigantic
vision
he
can
not
think
he
can
not
act
he
can
only
write
breathless
unreflecting
unable
to
control
himself
unable
to
exercise
the
critical
faculty
lest
he
dam
the
eruption
he
dashes
down
his
thoughts
on
scraps
of
paper
walking
standing
lying
down
in
the
street
at
table
in
the
night
as
if
under
unceasing
command
and
then
doubts
rise
up
from
the
depths
he
dines
with
educated
oppressed
people
who
confront
the
question
of
in
a
state
of
complete
helplessness
they
do
not
suspect
it
but
they
are
quiet
decent
timid
that
is
what
most
of
us
are
will
they
understand
the
call
to
freedom
and
to
manhood
when
i
left
them
my
spirits
were
very
low
again
my
plan
appeared
to
me
to
be
crazy
then
at
once
he
comes
to
today
i
am
again
as
firm
as
steel
he
notes
the
next
morning
the
flabbiness
of
the
people
i
met
yesterday
gives
me
all
the
more
grounds
for
action
clearer
and
clearer
becomes
the
picture
which
he
has
of
himself
and
of
his
task
in
the
history
of
his
people
i
picked
up
once
again
the
torn
thread
of
the
tradition
of
our
people
i
lead
it
into
the
promised
land
the
promised
land
where
we
can
have
hooked
noses
black
or
red
beards
and
bow
legs
without
being
despised
for
it
where
we
can
live
at
last
as
free
men
on
our
own
soil
and
where
we
can
die
peacefully
in
our
own
fatherland
there
we
can
expect
the
award
of
honor
for
great
deeds
so
that
the
offensive
cry
of
may
become
an
honorable
appellation
like
german
englishman
frenchman
in
brief
like
all
civilized
peoples
so
that
we
may
be
able
to
form
our
state
to
educate
our
people
for
the
tasks
which
at
present
still
lie
beyond
our
vision
for
surely
god
would
not
have
kept
us
alive
so
long
if
there
were
not
assigned
to
us
a
specific
role
in
the
history
of
mankind
he
adds
the
jewish
state
is
a
world
need
he
draws
the
logical
consequence
for
himself
i
believe
that
for
me
life
has
ended
and
world
history
begun
he
let
the
first
storm
pass
over
him
yielding
to
its
imperious
will
making
no
effort
to
stem
its
fury
lest
he
interrupt
the
inspiration
when
it
had
had
its
way
with
him
he
took
hold
of
himself
again
and
gathered
up
his
energies
for
the
effort
to
reconstruct
everything
logically
and
in
ordered
fashion
he
was
afraid
that
death
might
come
upon
him
before
he
had
succeeded
in
reducing
to
transferable
form
his
historic
vision
thus
in
the
course
of
five
days
he
added
to
his
diary
a
page
pamphlet
in
effect
the
outline
of
which
he
called
to
the
in
the
address
he
writes
i
have
the
solution
to
the
jewish
question
i
know
it
sounds
mad
and
at
the
beginning
i
shall
be
called
mad
more
than
once
until
the
truth
of
what
i
am
saying
is
recognized
in
all
its
shattering
force
he
wrote
to
bismarck
asking
for
an
interview
in
order
to
submit
his
plan
for
a
solution
to
the
jewish
problem
but
he
received
no
reply
he
wrote
to
rabbi
gudemann
chief
rabbi
of
vienna
the
occasion
being
the
excesses
which
had
occurred
in
vienna
this
plan
is
a
reserve
against
more
evil
days
herzl
in
his
first
visit
to
england
met
and
talked
with
israel
zangwill
the
novelist
whom
he
impressed
without
quite
winning
him
over
but
zangwill
made
it
possible
for
him
to
meet
more
than
a
few
prominent
influential
jews
of
whom
he
made
immediate
converts
none
of
them
wanted
to
know
anything
about
the
argentine
and
on
this
point
the
practical
men
were
united
with
the
dreamers
palestine
alone
came
into
the
picture
for
a
national
concentration
of
the
jews
after
his
experiences
in
england
herzl
resolved
to
present
his
plan
to
the
public
at
large
the
to
the
which
was
the
first
complete
writing
of
his
plan
forged
in
the
heat
of
inspiration
was
thoroughly
reworked
and
emerged
as
his
great
book
its
title
was
jewish
state
an
attempt
at
a
modern
solution
of
the
jewish
problem
der
may
properly
be
called
herzl
life
work
his
philosophy
of
the
world
his
views
on
the
state
on
the
jewish
people
on
science
and
technology
as
we
have
seen
them
developing
to
this
his
year
are
concentrated
in
the
book
the
jewish
state
was
published
in
an
edition
of
three
thousand
it
was
read
by
small
circles
in
various
european
capitals
it
was
sent
to
leading
personalities
in
the
press
and
political
circles
it
was
soon
translated
into
several
languages
herzl
received
many
letters
from
authors
and
statesmen
in
which
the
work
was
praised
but
the
general
german
press
especially
the
press
took
a
negative
attitude
a
number
of
journalists
alluded
to
the
adventurer
who
would
like
to
become
prime
minister
or
king
of
the
jews
no
mention
of
the
jewish
state
appeared
in
the
neue
freie
presse
then
or
ever
the
algemeine
zeitung
of
vienna
said
that
zionism
was
a
madness
born
of
despair
the
algemeine
zeitung
of
munich
described
it
as
a
fantastic
dream
of
a
feuilletonist
whose
mind
had
been
unhinged
by
jewish
enthusiasm
it
was
upon
the
jewish
masses
that
herzl
made
a
tremendous
impression
he
dawned
upon
jews
of
eastern
europe
as
a
mystic
figure
rising
out
of
the
past
little
was
known
of
his
pamphlet
for
it
was
kept
out
of
the
country
by
censorship
in
russia
only
its
title
got
their
attention
and
the
stories
told
of
herzl
the
western
jew
returning
to
his
people
gripped
their
hearts
and
stirred
their
imagination
he
was
greeted
by
one
of
the
galician
zionist
societies
as
the
leader
who
like
moses
had
returned
from
midian
to
liberate
the
jews
max
nordau
that
devastating
critic
of
art
and
literature
was
swept
off
his
feet
and
described
the
pamphlet
as
a
revelation
richard
beer
hoffman
the
poet
wrote
to
herzl
saying
at
last
there
comes
again
a
man
who
does
not
carry
his
judaism
with
resignation
as
if
it
were
a
burden
or
a
misfortune
but
is
proud
to
be
the
legal
heir
of
an
immemorial
culture
it
became
clear
to
herzl
that
he
would
have
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
task
he
had
set
forth
in
the
jewish
state
he
no
longer
felt
that
he
stood
alone
he
was
not
inclined
to
appear
on
a
public
platform
he
had
the
shyness
of
the
man
who
had
always
written
what
he
had
to
say
he
also
felt
that
it
would
do
more
harm
than
good
if
his
ideas
were
to
be
obscured
by
his
personal
presence
through
correspondence
he
set
in
motion
zionist
activities
in
london
in
paris
in
berlin
in
the
united
states
the
amount
of
he
developed
was
enormous
he
decided
that
there
were
three
tasks
to
be
undertaken
at
once
the
first
was
the
organization
of
the
society
of
jews
the
second
was
to
continue
diplomatic
work
in
constantinople
and
among
interested
powers
the
third
was
the
creation
of
a
press
to
influence
public
opinion
and
to
prepare
the
jewish
masses
for
the
great
migration
through
the
rev
hechler
a
chaplain
of
the
british
embassy
in
vienna
who
believed
in
the
jewish
return
to
the
holy
land
herzl
was
introduced
to
the
grand
duke
of
baden
a
christian
of
great
piety
and
influence
in
political
circles
herzl
intended
to
use
the
influence
of
the
germans
to
affect
the
sultan
and
make
him
more
sympathetic
to
zionist
proposals
herzl
told
the
grand
duke
that
he
would
like
to
have
zionism
included
within
the
cultural
sphere
of
german
interests
the
grand
duke
said
that
the
kaiser
seemed
inclined
to
take
jewish
migration
under
german
protection
the
great
powers
were
interested
in
maintaining
certain
extra
territorial
rights
within
the
turkish
empire
if
they
had
nationals
in
any
part
of
the
empire
they
claimed
the
right
to
protect
them
over
and
above
turkish
law
it
was
therefore
not
the
interest
in
the
jews
but
in
extending
german
jurisdiction
within
the
turkish
empire
that
persuaded
him
to
suggest
the
adoption
of
jews
in
palestine
for
that
purpose
germany
had
a
special
relationship
to
turkey
most
of
the
western
powers
were
openly
discussing
the
impending
partition
of
the
turkish
empire
but
germany
was
opposed
to
it
herzl
was
told
that
the
kaiser
was
prepared
to
see
him
at
the
head
of
a
delegation
when
he
visited
palestine
but
herzl
was
anxious
to
see
the
kaiser
without
delay
he
suggested
an
audience
before
the
trip
to
palestine
in
order
that
the
kaiser
might
be
in
a
position
to
discuss
the
jewish
question
with
the
sultan
the
grand
duke
advised
herzl
to
see
count
philip
zu
eulenberg
the
german
ambassador
at
vienna
herzl
was
given
an
opportunity
to
see
count
eulenberg
in
vienna
herzl
told
him
that
he
wanted
his
imperial
majesty
to
persuade
the
sultan
to
open
negotiations
with
the
jews
the
count
passed
herzl
over
to
the
german
minister
of
foreign
affairs
von
buelow
who
happened
to
be
in
vienna
at
the
same
time
van
buelow
knew
a
great
deal
about
the
zionist
movement
he
said
that
the
difficulty
lay
in
persuading
the
sultan
to
deal
with
the
jews
he
felt
certain
that
the
sultan
could
be
impressed
if
he
was
properly
advised
by
the
kaiser
a
week
later
herzl
was
informed
of
the
inclination
to
take
the
jews
of
palestine
under
his
protection
and
repeated
that
he
would
like
to
see
herzl
at
the
head
of
a
delegation
in
jerusalem
later
on
herzl
was
afraid
of
going
further
in
this
direction
without
having
in
existence
the
financial
instrument
without
which
neither
negotiations
nor
colonization
could
be
carried
on
herzl
urged
david
wolffsohn
and
jacobus
kahn
to
proceed
with
the
utmost
speed
to
incorporate
the
jewish
colonial
trust
he
foresaw
the
possibility
that
a
demand
might
be
made
at
any
time
to
show
the
color
of
his
money
although
the
affairs
of
the
bank
were
in
the
hands
of
wolffsohn
and
kahn
herzl
himself
worried
over
every
detail
urging
and
driving
and
complaining
about
the
slowness
of
the
action
on
march
the
subscription
lists
were
opened
herzl
expectations
were
not
fulfilled
only
about
shares
had
been
sold
of
them
in
russia
the
bank
could
not
be
opened
until
it
had
at
least
shares
after
a
great
deal
of
effort
the
minimum
was
finally
obtained
and
the
trust
was
officially
opened
in
time
for
the
opening
of
the
third
congress
in
august
herzl
addressed
a
mass
meeting
in
london
in
october
under
gastner
chairmanship
in
his
address
at
this
meeting
herzl
said
that
he
believed
the
time
was
not
far
off
when
the
jewish
people
would
be
set
in
motion
he
asked
the
audience
to
accept
his
word
even
if
he
could
not
speak
more
definitely
when
i
return
to
you
again
he
said
we
shall
i
hope
be
still
further
on
our
path
at
this
meeting
father
ignatius
a
catholic
believer
in
zionism
referred
to
herzl
as
a
new
joshua
who
had
come
to
fulfill
the
words
of
the
prophet
ezekiel
the
effect
produced
upon
the
audience
was
not
useful
to
herzl
purposes
at
that
time
he
had
always
tried
to
discourage
the
impression
of
himself
as
a
messianic
figure
the
meeting
in
london
was
the
only
occasion
where
he
lost
his
in
public
when
herzl
met
the
foreign
minister
von
buelow
again
it
was
in
the
presence
of
the
reich
chancellor
hohenlohe
at
once
he
perceived
a
different
nuance
in
the
conversation
and
a
dissonance
in
comparison
with
the
conversation
he
had
had
with
count
eulenberg
he
thought
that
the
chancellor
and
the
foreign
minister
were
not
in
agreement
with
the
kaiser
and
did
not
dare
to
say
it
openly
or
on
the
other
hand
they
might
be
favorably
inclined
but
would
not
be
willing
to
say
it
to
him
finally
herzl
saw
the
kaiser
in
constantinople
after
herzl
had
introduced
the
subject
of
his
visit
the
kaiser
broke
in
and
explained
why
the
zionist
movement
attracted
him
there
are
among
your
people
said
the
kaiser
certain
elements
whom
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
move
to
palestine
he
asked
herzl
to
submit
in
advance
the
address
he
intended
to
present
to
him
in
jerusalem
when
he
was
asked
what
the
kaiser
should
place
before
the
sultan
as
the
gist
of
the
jewish
proposals
herzl
replied
a
chartered
company
under
german
protection
herzl
met
the
kaiser
as
arranged
in
palestine
herzl
arrived
in
jaffa
on
october
on
a
friday
morning
he
awaited
the
coming
of
the
kaiser
and
his
entourage
on
the
road
that
ran
by
the
colony
of
mikveh
israel
the
kaiser
recognized
him
from
a
distance
he
said
a
few
words
about
the
weather
about
the
lack
of
water
in
palestine
and
that
it
was
a
land
that
had
a
future
in
the
petition
herzl
later
submitted
to
the
kaiser
many
of
the
pregnant
passages
were
deleted
by
the
kaiser
advisers
all
passages
that
referred
specifically
to
the
aims
of
the
zionist
movement
to
the
desperate
need
of
the
jewish
people
and
asking
for
the
protection
of
a
projected
jewish
land
company
for
syria
and
palestine
had
been
removed
the
audience
with
the
kaiser
took
place
on
monday
november
the
kaiser
thanked
herzl
for
the
address
which
he
said
had
interested
him
extremely
it
was
the
kaiser
opinion
that
the
soil
was
cultivable
what
the
land
lacked
was
water
and
shade
that
we
can
supply
said
herzl
it
would
cost
billions
but
it
will
bring
in
billions
too
well
you
certainly
have
enough
money
more
than
all
of
us
said
the
kaiser
it
was
a
brief
interview
it
was
vague
and
seemed
to
lead
nowhere
herzl
was
under
the
impression
that
certain
influences
had
been
exerted
between
the
interview
in
constantinople
and
the
audience
in
jerusalem
when
the
official
german
communique
was
issued
the
encounter
with
herzl
was
hid
in
a
closing
paragraph
and
deprived
of
all
significance
this
is
how
it
read
later
the
kaiser
received
the
french
consul
also
a
jewish
deputation
which
presented
him
with
an
album
of
pictures
of
the
jewish
colonies
in
palestine
in
reply
to
an
address
by
the
leader
of
the
deputation
his
majesty
remarked
he
viewed
with
benevolent
interest
all
efforts
directed
to
the
improvement
of
agriculture
in
palestine
as
long
as
these
accorded
with
the
welfare
of
the
turkish
empire
and
were
conducted
in
a
spirit
of
complete
respect
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
sultan
it
was
a
sudden
descent
from
hope
into
a
closed
road
herzl
refused
to
be
discouraged
it
was
hard
for
him
to
realize
that
the
enthusiasm
in
constantinople
could
have
cooled
off
so
quickly
in
jerusalem
but
it
seemed
that
there
was
no
way
to
continue
contact
with
the
people
he
had
interested
in
germany
he
tried
to
pick
up
the
broken
threads
but
once
broken
they
could
not
be
revived
the
grand
duke
of
baden
remained
ever
constant
and
loyal
but
he
could
do
nothing
herzl
never
saw
the
kaiser
again
in
a
letter
to
the
grand
duke
closing
this
chapter
of
zionist
history
herzl
said
i
can
only
assume
that
a
hope
especially
dear
to
me
has
faded
away
and
that
we
shall
not
achieve
our
zionist
goal
under
a
german
protectorate
at
about
the
same
time
herzl
met
philip
michael
von
nevlinski
a
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
polish
noblemen
who
had
entered
the
diplomatic
service
and
became
a
diplomatic
and
a
french
journalist
in
the
first
stages
nevlinski
guided
herzl
in
all
the
work
he
did
in
constantinople
when
herzl
came
to
constantinople
in
june
he
was
under
the
impression
that
nevlinski
had
already
arranged
an
audience
with
the
sultan
it
was
not
so
easy
however
but
whether
such
an
audience
had
been
arranged
or
not
herzl
was
able
to
meet
a
number
of
turkish
officials
including
the
grand
vizier
at
first
the
line
of
action
was
not
clear
but
by
now
herzl
had
formulated
his
proposals
to
the
sultan
ever
since
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
turkish
finances
had
been
in
a
shocking
condition
the
empire
was
being
badly
managed
the
sultan
was
regarded
as
the
sick
man
of
europe
in
the
total
external
debt
including
unpaid
interest
reached
the
figure
of
two
hundred
and
million
pounds
sterling
in
there
was
a
consolidation
of
the
debt
it
was
reduced
to
one
hundred
and
six
million
pounds
but
the
finances
of
turkey
were
placed
under
the
control
of
a
committee
representing
the
creditors
to
whom
was
transferred
certain
domestic
turkish
monopolies
and
the
collection
of
several
categories
of
taxes
this
enabled
the
european
powers
to
intervene
in
the
affairs
of
turkey
only
by
the
removal
of
this
foreign
tutelage
could
turkey
hope
to
regain
its
independence
it
was
to
achieve
this
end
herzl
thought
that
the
jews
and
the
jews
alone
could
be
useful
for
this
service
he
intended
to
ask
for
a
jewish
state
in
palestine
herzl
followed
this
line
until
finally
the
need
for
refunding
the
turkish
debt
disappeared
but
at
this
time
herzl
was
not
able
to
obtain
an
audience
with
the
sultan
nevlinski
reported
that
such
an
audience
had
been
refused
because
the
sultan
declined
to
discuss
sovereignty
over
palestine
doubt
was
expressed
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
report
whatever
the
fact
may
be
the
first
venture
of
herzl
in
constantinople
was
not
successful
herzl
moved
along
the
lines
that
led
to
constantinople
and
berlin
but
he
did
not
overlook
the
importance
of
maintaining
contact
with
jewish
philanthropies
a
letter
sent
to
the
baron
de
hirsch
came
a
day
after
his
death
herzl
went
to
london
where
matters
had
been
arranged
for
him
to
meet
the
leaders
of
british
jewry
he
met
claude
montefiore
and
frederick
mocatte
representatives
of
the
association
they
were
not
sympathetic
herzl
fared
no
better
at
a
banquet
given
to
him
by
the
maccabbeans
the
personal
impression
herzl
made
was
profound
but
there
was
no
practical
issue
nor
did
he
make
any
progress
during
the
time
he
spent
in
england
he
got
sir
samuel
montagu
and
colonel
goldsmith
to
agree
to
cooperate
with
him
in
an
endeavor
to
establish
a
vassal
jewish
state
under
the
sovereignty
of
turkey
if
the
powers
would
agree
provided
the
baron
de
hirsch
fund
placed
at
his
disposal
for
the
plan
and
baron
edmund
de
rothschild
became
a
member
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
proposed
society
of
jews
these
conditions
were
fantastic
at
that
time
and
herzl
could
not
meet
them
he
went
to
paris
and
had
a
talk
with
baron
edmund
baron
edmund
was
older
than
herzl
and
felt
ill
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
a
calm
critic
of
all
he
had
done
for
jewish
colonization
in
palestine
herzl
made
the
impression
on
him
of
an
undisciplined
enthusiast
baron
edmund
did
not
believe
it
possible
to
create
political
conditions
favorable
for
a
mass
immigration
of
jews
even
if
that
could
be
done
an
uncontrolled
mass
immigration
into
palestine
would
have
the
effect
of
landing
tens
of
thousands
of
jews
to
be
fed
and
looked
after
by
the
small
jewish
community
in
palestine
he
clung
to
his
idea
of
slow
colonization
attracting
no
attention
and
careful
not
to
provoke
hostility
every
reply
of
herzl
fell
upon
a
closed
mind
baron
edmund
refusal
to
cooperate
was
decisive
this
was
a
decision
of
historic
significance
it
turned
herzl
away
from
the
thought
that
the
zionist
movement
should
be
built
upon
the
support
of
jewish
philanthropy
all
his
hopes
in
this
connection
were
dissolved
by
the
contacts
he
had
made
in
london
and
in
paris
baron
edmund
refusal
to
cooperate
carried
with
it
the
refusal
of
the
baron
de
hirsch
fund
and
of
the
circle
of
leading
jews
in
london
reluctantly
herzl
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
only
one
reply
to
this
situation
the
jewish
masses
must
be
organized
for
the
support
of
the
zionist
movement
the
organization
he
had
in
mind
was
not
a
popular
democratic
organization
what
he
meant
was
to
assemble
the
upper
cadres
to
take
charge
of
the
organization
of
the
masses
for
the
great
migration
at
the
same
time
he
wanted
to
prove
to
the
philanthropists
that
a
popular
organization
was
possible
he
felt
that
they
would
be
greatly
influenced
by
the
development
of
a
widespread
popular
movement
whatever
his
thoughts
were
at
that
time
his
decision
to
turn
to
the
jewish
masses
to
abandon
reliance
upon
the
wealthy
led
to
the
organization
of
the
modern
zionist
movement
he
organized
his
followers
in
vienna
he
was
the
center
of
a
circle
in
which
were
included
the
men
who
later
became
the
members
of
the
first
zionist
actions
committee
in
november
he
for
the
first
time
addressed
a
public
meeting
in
vienna
in
this
address
he
did
not
use
the
term
the
jewish
state
nor
did
he
use
it
in
most
of
his
public
utterances
at
that
time
he
had
become
cautious
he
did
not
want
to
prejudice
his
political
work
in
constantinople
he
was
still
thinking
of
issuing
a
newspaper
but
there
were
no
funds
for
that
purpose
the
report
that
he
intended
to
issue
a
newspaper
drew
the
attention
of
a
number
of
personalities
and
groups
in
berlin
there
were
the
russian
jewish
students
led
by
leo
motzkin
and
a
group
called
young
israel
headed
by
reinrich
loewe
a
conference
was
held
on
march
and
called
by
osias
thon
willy
bambus
and
nathan
birnbaum
they
had
come
together
to
talk
about
a
newspaper
but
the
first
zionist
congress
was
launched
at
this
meeting
proposal
for
the
calling
of
a
general
zionist
conference
in
munich
was
agreed
to
in
the
preliminary
announcement
of
the
calling
of
this
conference
or
congress
herzl
said
the
jewish
question
must
be
removed
from
the
control
of
the
benevolent
individual
there
must
be
created
a
forum
before
which
everyone
acting
for
the
jewish
people
should
appear
and
to
which
he
should
be
responsible
every
one
of
herzl
ideas
was
met
by
protests
and
public
excitement
the
protests
were
usually
launched
by
jews
the
calling
of
the
congress
aroused
a
great
deal
of
indignation
in
conservative
circles
the
rabbis
of
germany
protested
not
only
to
the
holding
of
the
congress
but
also
the
choice
of
munich
the
congress
controversy
persuaded
herzl
to
begin
the
publication
of
the
weekly
die
welt
the
first
issue
appeared
on
june
herzl
provided
the
funds
the
journal
was
something
new
in
jewish
life
it
was
in
fact
the
organ
of
the
congress
throughout
herzl
life
die
welt
served
as
the
exponent
of
his
ideas
at
first
herzl
contributed
numerous
articles
he
sent
in
a
regular
weekly
review
of
all
activities
connected
with
the
movement
he
was
responsible
for
many
unsigned
articles
and
notices
he
directed
the
paper
in
all
its
details
although
he
refused
to
figure
as
its
official
editor
and
publisher
the
amount
of
work
he
did
during
the
months
preceding
the
congress
was
amazing
he
was
completely
absorbed
in
every
aspect
of
the
congress
the
man
of
the
pen
revealed
himself
as
a
man
of
action
on
august
the
first
zionist
congress
was
assembled
not
in
munich
but
in
basle
switzerland
the
majority
of
the
delegates
to
the
first
zionist
congress
drawn
to
basle
from
all
parts
of
the
world
saw
herzl
for
the
first
time
the
total
number
of
delegates
at
the
first
session
was
the
first
act
of
the
congress
was
the
adoption
of
a
resolution
of
thanks
to
the
sultan
of
turkey
then
herzl
rose
and
walked
over
to
the
pulpit
it
was
no
longer
the
elegant
herzl
of
vienna
it
was
no
longer
the
literary
man
the
critic
the
feuilletonist
as
one
reporter
said
it
was
a
scion
of
the
house
of
david
risen
from
among
the
dead
clothed
in
legend
and
fantasy
and
beauty
the
first
words
uttered
by
herzl
were
we
are
here
to
lay
the
foundation
stone
of
the
house
which
is
to
shelter
the
jewish
nation
we
zionists
he
stressed
seek
for
the
solution
of
the
jewish
question
not
an
international
society
but
an
international
discussion
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
conspiracy
secret
intervention
or
indirect
methods
we
wish
to
place
the
question
under
the
control
of
free
public
opinion
his
first
congress
address
contained
the
ideas
which
he
had
already
expressed
in
previous
speeches
and
articles
but
there
was
a
great
difference
between
the
views
in
the
jewish
state
and
the
address
delivered
at
the
first
session
of
the
zionist
congress
the
latter
is
the
carefully
considered
public
statement
of
one
who
knew
he
represented
tens
of
thousands
perhaps
hundreds
of
thousands
of
followers
his
words
were
not
those
of
a
seer
but
of
a
statesman
almost
as
profound
was
the
effect
produced
it
was
at
this
congress
that
the
basle
program
was
adopted
zionism
seeks
to
secure
for
the
jewish
people
a
publicly
recognized
legally
secured
home
or
homeland
in
palestine
the
second
important
task
of
the
first
congress
was
the
creation
of
an
organization
the
congress
was
declared
to
be
the
chief
organ
of
the
zionist
movement
the
basis
of
electoral
right
was
to
be
the
payment
of
a
shekel
which
at
that
time
was
equivalent
to
cents
there
was
to
be
an
executive
committee
with
its
permanent
seat
in
vienna
everything
which
was
to
unfold
later
in
zionism
both
in
the
way
of
affirmative
forces
and
inner
contradictions
was
already
visible
or
latent
in
the
first
congress
there
was
discussion
of
a
bank
of
a
land
redemption
fund
to
be
called
the
national
fund
the
creation
of
a
hebrew
university
and
the
clashes
between
practical
and
political
zionism
on
his
return
to
vienna
herzl
made
the
following
entry
in
his
diary
if
i
were
to
sum
up
the
basle
congress
in
a
single
phrase
i
would
say
in
basle
i
created
the
jewish
state
were
i
to
say
this
aloud
i
would
be
greeted
by
universal
laughter
but
perhaps
five
years
hence
in
any
case
certainly
fifty
years
hence
everyone
will
perceive
it
the
state
exists
as
essence
in
the
of
a
people
yes
even
in
that
will
in
a
single
powerful
person
the
territory
is
only
the
concrete
basis
and
the
state
itself
with
a
territory
beneath
it
is
still
in
the
nature
of
an
abstract
thing
in
basle
i
created
the
abstraction
which
as
such
is
invisible
to
the
great
majority
all
that
herzl
did
in
the
political
field
his
conversations
in
constantinople
his
interview
with
the
grand
duke
of
baden
in
advance
of
the
holding
of
the
first
congress
was
undertaken
as
author
of
a
political
pamphlet
he
was
now
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
called
upon
to
act
as
president
of
the
world
zionist
organization
it
was
difficult
to
draw
a
line
between
the
movement
and
its
leader
herzl
insisted
that
his
leadership
in
the
movement
was
impersonal
and
that
now
its
direction
was
vested
in
its
instruments
the
congress
and
the
actions
committee
but
he
had
all
the
authority
of
an
accepted
leader
the
evolution
of
herzl
conception
of
the
jewish
problem
since
he
saw
the
degradation
of
dreyfus
can
be
measured
by
a
study
of
the
articles
he
wrote
after
the
first
congress
he
himself
was
quite
aware
of
the
transformation
he
had
seen
the
jewish
people
face
to
face
brothers
have
found
each
other
again
he
said
he
wrote
with
great
appreciation
of
the
quality
of
the
russian
delegates
he
said
they
possess
that
inner
unity
which
has
disappeared
from
among
the
westerners
they
are
steeped
in
jewish
national
sentiment
without
betraying
any
national
narrowness
and
intolerance
they
are
not
tortured
by
the
idea
of
assimilation
they
do
not
assimilate
into
other
nations
but
exert
themselves
to
learn
the
best
in
other
peoples
in
this
way
they
manage
to
remain
erect
and
genuine
looking
on
them
we
understood
where
our
forefathers
got
the
strength
to
endure
through
the
bitterest
times
immediately
after
the
first
congress
herzl
grappled
with
his
second
task
the
creation
of
the
jewish
colonial
bank
he
wrote
of
the
bank
in
in
november
the
task
of
the
colonial
bank
is
to
eliminate
philanthropy
the
settler
on
the
land
who
increases
its
value
by
his
labor
merits
more
than
a
gift
he
is
entitled
to
credit
the
prospective
bank
could
therefore
begin
by
extending
the
needed
credits
to
the
colonists
later
it
would
expand
into
the
instrument
for
the
bringing
in
of
jews
and
would
supply
credits
for
transportation
agriculture
commerce
and
construction
the
seat
of
the
bank
was
to
be
london
there
were
to
be
two
billion
shares
at
each
the
bank
was
to
be
directed
by
men
acquainted
with
banking
affairs
but
the
movement
would
be
placed
in
a
position
to
control
its
policy
the
hopes
of
herzl
grew
from
week
to
week
as
he
approached
the
practical
situation
he
became
less
and
less
confident
of
the
cooperation
of
men
of
wealth
differences
arose
in
the
preliminary
discussions
as
to
the
scope
of
the
bank
in
the
first
draft
of
the
articles
of
incorporation
the
orient
alone
was
named
as
the
area
of
work
for
the
bank
menachem
ussishkin
insisted
that
the
words
syria
and
palestine
should
be
substituted
after
a
great
deal
of
discussion
the
proposals
for
the
formation
of
the
bank
were
brought
to
the
second
zionist
congress
and
the
articles
of
incorporation
as
amended
were
adopted
by
acclamation
herzl
clung
to
the
idea
which
had
come
to
him
when
he
was
thinking
of
the
jewish
state
as
a
pamphlet
that
it
might
be
better
for
him
to
write
a
novel
the
impulse
to
write
such
a
novel
became
irresistible
after
his
visit
to
palestine
it
was
to
be
called
altneuland
he
began
to
write
it
in
it
was
completed
in
april
and
published
six
months
later
it
is
remarkable
that
he
could
write
such
a
novel
while
engaged
in
varied
political
activities
in
constantinople
in
london
and
in
berlin
and
while
he
had
to
deal
with
the
many
troublesome
internal
zionist
problems
altneuland
was
a
novel
with
a
purpose
it
described
the
palestine
of
the
near
future
as
it
would
develop
through
the
zionist
movement
it
had
the
weaknesses
of
every
propaganda
novel
the
entire
work
has
something
of
the
state
about
it
and
proceeds
in
the
form
of
scenes
rather
than
by
way
of
narrative
each
type
has
a
specific
outlook
most
of
the
characters
are
portraits
of
living
personalities
it
was
his
purpose
to
memorialize
his
friends
and
his
opponents
altneuland
tells
of
a
jew
who
visits
palestine
in
and
then
comes
again
in
when
he
finds
the
promised
land
developed
under
jewish
influence
its
territory
lies
east
and
west
of
the
jordan
the
dead
land
of
is
now
thoroughly
alive
its
real
creators
were
the
irrigation
engineers
technology
had
given
a
new
form
to
labor
a
new
social
and
economic
system
had
been
created
which
is
described
as
mutualistic
a
huge
cooperative
a
mediate
form
between
individualism
and
collectivism
haifa
had
become
a
world
city
around
the
holy
city
of
jerusalem
modern
suburbs
had
arisen
shaded
boulevards
and
parks
institutes
of
learning
places
of
amusement
markets
a
world
city
in
the
spirit
of
the
twentieth
century
in
this
new
land
the
arabs
live
side
by
side
in
friendship
with
the
jews
altneuland
did
not
produce
the
effect
herzl
had
expected
within
the
zionist
movement
it
did
more
harm
than
good
many
of
herzl
friends
were
disappointed
that
the
novel
should
have
so
little
of
the
jewish
spirit
it
ignored
the
hebraic
renaissance
the
novel
evoked
the
sharpest
criticism
from
achad
haam
while
herzl
was
immersed
in
political
action
visiting
european
capitals
carrying
on
correspondence
with
leading
persons
whose
interest
in
zionism
he
had
engaged
and
submitting
reports
to
the
zionist
congress
or
to
the
actions
committee
often
facing
critical
situations
in
his
struggle
with
growing
zionist
parties
the
zionist
organization
was
gradually
becoming
an
accepted
institution
in
jewish
life
it
was
the
international
sounding
board
for
the
discussion
of
the
jewish
question
the
jewish
national
fund
was
founded
at
the
fourth
congress
held
in
london
in
the
jewish
colonial
trust
was
finally
established
with
headquarters
in
london
the
first
zionist
party
in
the
congress
was
the
democratic
faction
led
by
leo
motzkin
but
soon
there
were
added
the
mizrachi
party
and
the
beginnings
of
a
labor
party
not
only
nordau
stirring
addresses
but
many
controversies
made
congresses
the
cultural
issue
was
a
congress
perennial
many
discussions
also
took
place
around
what
was
called
the
issue
of
practical
and
political
zionism
the
russians
under
the
leadership
of
ussishkin
were
all
heartily
against
the
charter
emphasis
and
drove
with
maddening
persistence
for
immediate
work
in
palestine
in
the
course
of
these
debates
continued
over
the
years
the
congress
became
a
forum
for
the
discussion
of
international
jewish
problems
and
developed
speakers
and
theorists
of
varying
degrees
of
talent
it
also
produced
men
with
hobbies
the
jewish
national
fund
and
the
hebrew
university
was
the
hobby
of
herman
schapiro
colonization
in
cyprus
was
the
hobby
of
davis
trietsch
who
created
many
scenes
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
chaim
weizmann
was
not
only
a
leader
of
the
democratic
faction
crossing
swords
time
and
again
with
herzl
but
devoted
much
time
and
thought
to
the
idea
of
a
hebrew
university
the
procedure
of
the
congress
based
on
continental
models
was
gradually
worked
out
and
became
fixed
and
many
of
the
delegates
were
adepts
in
the
art
of
procedural
sparring
the
language
in
congresses
used
during
herzl
life
was
german
but
gradually
the
imperfect
use
of
german
by
east
european
zionists
led
to
the
development
of
what
was
called
congress
german
this
was
a
form
of
german
that
was
easy
to
use
because
respect
for
grammar
and
pronunciation
was
not
required
during
the
congresses
herzl
maintained
throughout
the
role
of
leader
and
moderator
his
manner
was
gracious
and
he
never
lost
his
sense
of
dignity
he
was
capable
of
sharp
retort
but
always
bore
in
mind
that
it
was
high
duty
to
hold
a
balance
and
to
seek
compromise
rather
than
sharp
division
he
developed
it
in
a
most
remarkable
way
on
the
platform
his
appearances
were
dramatic
his
interventions
were
arresting
the
man
of
the
writing
desk
developed
as
one
of
the
ablest
in
the
parliamentary
arts
after
some
of
the
congresses
he
had
to
retire
to
a
health
resort
having
exhausted
his
strength
and
bringing
on
a
recurrence
of
his
heart
trouble
on
a
number
of
occasions
his
close
friends
feared
for
his
life
but
after
a
few
weeks
of
rest
he
usually
returned
stronger
than
before
and
with
greater
determination
to
pursue
his
course
regardless
of
the
consequences
to
himself
at
this
point
it
is
important
to
refer
to
his
family
life
he
had
married
julie
naschauer
on
july
she
was
the
daughter
of
wealthy
parents
and
grew
up
in
a
conventional
social
circle
when
she
married
herzl
he
was
already
a
rising
young
author
who
was
highly
regarded
among
those
with
whom
she
associated
he
was
attractive
aristocratic
in
bearing
a
keen
conversationalist
and
had
all
the
qualities
of
being
a
conventional
partner
of
a
conventional
wife
but
herzl
threw
himself
into
zionist
affairs
with
such
tremendous
dynamic
activity
and
was
so
completely
absorbed
in
the
idea
which
his
thinking
had
given
birth
to
that
except
for
occasional
interim
periods
his
family
played
a
secondary
part
in
his
life
ever
after
he
had
taken
up
the
jewish
problems
his
special
task
in
life
julie
herzl
also
suffered
by
reason
of
herzl
devotion
to
his
own
mother
herzl
never
rid
himself
of
his
filial
dependence
which
made
it
very
hard
for
his
wife
to
understand
they
had
three
children
in
a
daughter
was
born
and
named
paula
or
pauline
in
his
son
hans
was
born
whose
life
after
his
father
death
became
a
serious
problem
there
was
a
third
child
a
daughter
margaret
known
as
trude
who
was
born
in
may
during
this
period
there
were
many
separations
from
his
family
there
were
disagreements
and
reconciliations
but
the
cup
of
unhappiness
for
julie
herzl
overflowed
when
herzl
became
the
official
leader
of
a
public
movement
from
that
time
on
her
home
was
constantly
overrun
with
unwelcome
visitors
not
only
did
herzl
give
his
life
to
the
movement
in
the
literal
sense
but
he
gave
his
reserve
of
funds
and
sacrificed
the
welfare
of
his
family
for
the
sake
of
the
movement
he
had
brought
to
life
his
domestic
affairs
as
well
as
his
failing
heart
made
all
the
years
of
herzl
brief
zionist
life
pain
and
struggle
the
tragic
position
of
jews
in
various
parts
of
europe
greatly
agitated
herzl
during
the
time
he
was
carrying
on
negotiations
with
the
kaiser
and
the
sultan
he
was
constantly
being
led
to
the
thought
that
it
would
become
necessary
to
find
a
temporary
haven
of
refuge
for
jews
in
a
series
of
pogroms
broke
out
in
galicia
in
his
diary
at
the
time
he
had
references
to
england
and
cyprus
we
may
even
have
to
consider
south
africa
or
america
but
he
banished
these
thoughts
from
his
mind
because
he
knew
that
the
zionists
would
place
serious
obstacles
in
the
way
of
considering
any
project
other
than
palestine
when
his
hopes
with
regard
to
germany
had
collapsed
however
he
thought
of
these
alternative
proposals
again
on
october
a
conference
between
joseph
chamberlain
the
colonial
secretary
and
herzl
took
place
chamberlain
had
been
in
the
colonial
office
since
he
held
an
influential
position
in
the
councils
of
the
british
government
he
was
a
man
of
strong
will
and
political
integrity
herzl
submitted
his
plan
for
the
colonization
of
cyprus
and
the
sinai
peninsula
which
included
el
arish
jewish
settlers
under
a
jewish
administration
chamberlain
said
that
he
could
speak
definitely
only
about
cyprus
the
sinai
peninsula
came
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
foreign
office
as
far
as
cyprus
was
concerned
he
believed
that
it
was
not
promising
because
the
greeks
and
moslems
would
object
and
it
would
be
his
official
duty
to
side
with
them
he
took
a
more
favorable
view
however
of
el
arish
in
that
connection
it
was
necessary
for
herzl
to
talk
to
lord
lansdowne
of
the
foreign
office
a
great
deal
would
depend
upon
the
of
lord
cromer
the
british
consul
general
in
egypt
and
actually
the
vice
regent
of
that
country
through
the
good
offices
of
chamberlain
it
became
possible
for
herzl
to
meet
lord
lansdowne
a
few
days
later
he
was
well
received
and
was
listened
to
with
a
great
deal
of
attention
herzl
was
asked
to
submit
a
written
expose
then
he
asked
for
permission
to
have
leopold
greenberg
go
to
egypt
and
confer
with
lord
cromer
lord
lansdowne
said
that
he
would
arrange
for
such
a
meeting
greenberg
discussed
the
matter
with
lord
cromer
in
cairo
there
were
objections
raised
by
both
lord
cromer
and
the
egyptian
prime
minister
on
the
ground
that
an
attempted
jewish
economy
undertaken
in
in
the
region
of
ancient
midian
had
been
a
pitiful
failure
there
had
been
political
complications
and
border
disputes
with
turkey
a
definitive
reply
was
received
by
herzl
on
december
written
on
behalf
of
lord
lansdowne
by
sir
sanderson
permanent
undersecretary
lord
lansdowne
had
heard
from
lord
cromer
who
favored
the
sending
of
a
small
commission
to
the
sinai
peninsula
to
report
on
conditions
and
prospects
but
lord
cromer
feared
that
no
sanguine
hopes
of
success
should
be
entertained
but
if
the
report
of
the
commission
turned
out
favorable
the
egyptian
government
would
certainly
offer
liberal
terms
for
jewish
colonization
on
the
other
hand
however
the
zionists
should
understand
that
they
would
be
expected
to
meet
the
cost
of
a
defense
corps
and
to
guarantee
the
administration
in
lord
cromer
opinion
the
most
important
question
was
that
of
the
rights
which
herzl
expected
for
the
projected
settlement
he
wrote
in
your
letter
of
the
ult
you
remark
that
you
will
become
great
and
promising
by
the
granting
of
this
right
of
colonization
your
letter
does
not
make
clear
what
is
to
be
understood
by
these
words
and
what
kind
of
rights
the
colonists
will
expect
lord
lansdowne
also
touched
on
the
question
of
the
new
citizenship
of
the
settlers
herzl
had
believed
that
he
would
have
only
englishmen
to
deal
with
since
england
had
become
more
and
more
the
master
of
egypt
it
was
apparent
however
that
the
egyptian
government
also
played
an
important
part
in
the
discussions
lord
cromer
confirmed
that
the
egyptian
government
would
make
it
an
essential
condition
that
the
new
settlers
become
turkish
subjects
bound
by
egyptian
law
but
while
the
british
occupation
continued
the
settlers
would
always
be
certain
of
fair
treatment
herzl
was
satisfied
with
this
letter
and
described
it
as
a
historic
document
the
british
government
had
recognized
herzl
as
the
zionist
leader
and
the
movement
represented
by
him
as
a
negotiating
party
he
already
saw
the
egyptian
province
of
judea
under
a
jewish
governor
with
its
own
defense
corps
under
officers
as
a
result
of
the
english
negotiations
lord
rothschild
seemed
to
be
won
over
by
herzl
the
old
banker
who
had
refused
two
years
before
to
meet
the
zionist
leader
now
visited
him
in
his
hotel
the
next
task
before
herzl
was
the
organization
of
the
commission
the
commission
was
composed
of
the
south
african
engineer
kessler
the
chief
inspector
of
the
egyptian
survey
department
humphreys
goldsmith
was
to
report
on
the
land
and
soskin
was
to
study
agricultural
possibilities
oscar
marmorek
was
to
investigate
building
and
housing
problems
and
act
as
general
secretary
hillel
jaffe
of
the
jaffe
hospital
was
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
climate
and
hygiene
the
commission
met
with
great
difficulties
there
was
opposition
by
the
turks
there
was
misunderstandings
between
herzl
and
greenberg
herzl
himself
went
to
egypt
in
order
to
bring
the
negotiations
to
a
conclusion
and
to
straighten
out
difficulties
his
intervention
in
no
way
improved
the
situation
lord
cromer
had
become
very
cool
toward
him
he
received
the
general
report
of
the
commission
which
observed
that
under
existing
conditions
the
land
is
quite
unsuitable
for
settlers
from
european
countries
but
if
sufficient
irrigation
were
introduced
the
agricultural
hygienic
and
climatic
conditions
are
such
that
part
of
the
land
which
is
at
present
wilderness
could
support
a
considerable
population
an
application
for
the
concession
was
made
by
herzl
on
the
advice
of
lord
cromer
having
as
his
legal
representative
a
belgian
lawyer
of
high
standing
the
egyptian
government
did
not
receive
with
favor
the
outline
of
the
concession
herzl
was
received
on
april
by
chamberlain
who
had
just
returned
from
his
african
journey
chamberlain
listened
to
the
report
given
by
herzl
on
the
work
of
the
commission
both
regarded
the
report
as
unfavorable
then
chamberlain
made
this
remark
on
my
travels
i
saw
a
country
for
you
uganda
on
the
coast
it
is
hot
but
in
the
interior
the
climate
is
excellent
for
europeans
you
can
plant
cotton
and
sugar
i
thought
to
myself
that
is
just
the
country
for
herzl
but
must
have
palestine
and
will
move
only
into
its
vicinity
this
was
the
first
reference
to
uganda
which
became
the
center
of
attention
in
zionist
circles
herzl
was
told
that
the
egyptian
government
would
reject
the
plan
it
was
found
that
the
area
would
require
five
times
as
much
water
as
had
been
first
estimated
the
egyptian
government
could
not
permit
the
diversion
of
such
a
quantity
of
water
from
the
nile
an
attempt
to
have
chamberlain
intervene
with
egypt
was
not
successful
that
being
the
case
said
chamberlain
what
about
uganda
would
be
accorded
the
governor
could
definitely
be
a
jew
although
the
matter
belonged
to
the
foreign
office
he
would
have
it
transferred
under
his
jurisdiction
in
the
colonial
office
the
territory
would
be
the
permanent
property
of
a
colonization
company
created
for
the
purpose
after
five
years
the
settlers
would
be
given
complete
autonomy
the
name
of
the
settlement
was
to
be
new
palestine
herzl
pressed
for
a
reply
from
the
government
in
order
that
the
project
might
be
presented
to
the
zionist
congress
on
august
the
official
proposal
came
from
sir
clement
hill
permanent
head
of
the
foreign
office
in
this
letter
it
was
stated
that
lord
landsdowne
had
studied
the
question
with
the
interest
which
his
government
always
felt
bound
to
take
in
every
serious
plan
destined
to
better
the
condition
of
the
jewish
race
the
time
had
been
too
short
for
a
closer
examination
of
the
plan
and
for
its
submission
to
the
british
representative
for
the
east
african
uganda
protectorate
lord
landsdowne
assumes
the
letter
continues
that
the
bank
desires
to
send
a
number
of
gentlemen
to
the
east
african
protectorate
to
establish
whether
there
is
in
that
territory
land
suitable
for
the
purpose
in
view
should
this
prove
to
be
the
case
he
will
be
happy
to
give
them
every
assistance
in
bringing
them
together
with
his
majesty
congress
the
conditions
under
which
the
settlement
could
be
carried
out
should
an
area
be
found
which
the
bank
and
his
representative
consider
suitable
and
his
majesty
government
consider
desirable
lord
lansdowne
will
be
glad
to
consider
favorably
proposals
for
the
creation
of
a
jewish
colony
or
settlement
under
such
conditions
as
will
seem
to
the
members
to
guarantee
the
retention
of
their
national
customs
the
document
went
on
with
an
offer
subject
to
the
consent
of
the
relevant
officials
of
a
jewish
governorship
and
internal
autonomy
this
was
the
first
official
proposal
in
connection
with
the
zionist
movement
which
herzl
was
able
to
submit
to
a
zionist
congress
when
the
letter
of
sir
clement
hill
was
submitted
to
the
sixth
zionist
congress
in
it
split
the
zionist
movement
wide
open
it
arrayed
the
overwhelming
majority
of
zionists
in
russia
against
herzl
and
he
was
called
upon
to
defend
himself
against
a
general
attack
which
preceded
the
convening
of
the
congress
when
the
congress
was
convened
in
an
atmosphere
of
great
excitement
and
partisan
controversy
the
uganda
project
was
submitted
in
the
form
of
an
official
resolution
calling
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
of
nine
to
be
sent
to
investigate
conditions
in
east
africa
the
final
decision
on
the
report
of
the
investigating
committee
was
to
be
left
to
a
special
congress
although
the
vote
showed
a
majority
in
favor
of
the
official
resolution
the
tally
was
for
against
and
absentees
the
debate
on
the
resolution
revealed
an
overwhelming
opposition
to
the
project
it
was
regarded
as
an
abandonment
of
palestine
in
favor
of
a
diversion
after
the
vote
the
russian
delegates
left
the
congress
in
a
body
all
the
opposition
delegates
left
with
them
and
met
in
conference
to
discuss
the
situation
when
herzl
heard
of
the
deep
feeling
that
prevailed
in
the
conference
he
asked
for
the
privilege
of
speaking
to
the
opposition
he
gave
them
his
solemn
assurance
that
the
basle
program
would
be
unaffected
by
the
resolution
he
swore
fealty
to
the
basle
program
to
zion
and
jerusalem
his
speech
revealed
the
great
transformation
that
had
taken
place
in
organic
relation
to
the
zionist
movement
the
opposition
delegates
felt
that
in
spite
of
herzl
seeking
alternately
one
or
another
substitute
for
palestine
his
heart
responded
without
reserve
to
the
appeal
of
zion
the
opposition
reappeared
in
the
congress
the
following
day
they
exacted
assurances
that
the
funds
of
the
jewish
colonial
trust
of
the
jewish
national
fund
and
the
shekel
income
should
not
be
used
for
the
commission
investigating
east
africa
and
that
the
commission
should
report
to
the
greater
actions
committee
before
it
appeared
to
submit
its
report
to
the
congress
herzl
experience
at
what
is
called
the
uganda
congress
drew
him
nearer
to
the
older
zionists
he
realized
now
that
the
ultimate
goal
could
not
be
reached
within
the
near
future
that
uganda
was
merely
a
compromise
achievement
providing
the
field
of
preparation
for
a
second
attempt
to
reach
zion
the
congress
of
was
the
climax
of
herzl
career
it
was
in
effect
the
end
of
his
quest
later
the
east
african
project
became
a
matter
of
lesser
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
english
the
english
colonists
in
east
africa
declared
their
opposition
to
a
jewish
settlement
a
zionist
opposition
was
organized
led
by
menahem
ussishkin
who
was
not
present
at
the
uganda
congress
the
charkov
conference
of
russian
zionists
was
called
herzl
was
charged
with
having
violated
the
basle
program
the
charkov
conference
disclaimed
responsibility
for
all
actions
in
the
direction
of
east
africa
it
appointed
a
committee
of
three
to
communicate
their
demands
to
herzl
they
asked
that
he
promise
that
he
would
not
place
before
the
congress
any
territorial
projects
other
than
those
connected
with
palestine
or
syria
and
that
he
would
take
east
africa
off
the
agenda
by
now
herzl
would
have
been
pleased
to
let
the
east
african
project
disappear
from
the
agenda
it
was
clear
that
the
english
government
was
not
greatly
interested
and
was
seeking
a
way
out
but
the
devious
route
of
political
action
once
started
could
not
so
easily
be
halted
herzl
found
himself
chained
to
a
political
reality
throughout
his
zionist
life
herzl
suffered
from
a
heart
ailment
which
became
more
and
more
acute
as
he
was
taken
up
by
the
excitements
and
activities
of
the
movement
he
became
aware
of
his
illness
soon
after
he
had
written
the
jewish
state
he
had
premonitions
of
the
fatal
consequences
but
persisted
in
carrying
the
burden
of
the
movement
himself
consuming
all
his
strength
in
the
process
at
intervals
he
was
forced
to
take
rest
cures
on
a
number
of
occasions
it
was
thought
that
he
had
reached
the
end
of
his
strength
when
he
was
grappling
with
the
uganda
project
an
intimate
friend
wrote
of
his
appearance
the
imposing
figure
is
now
stooped
the
face
sallow
the
eyes
the
mirrors
of
a
fine
soul
were
darkened
the
mouth
was
drawn
in
pain
and
marked
by
passion
he
was
almost
at
the
brink
of
the
grave
in
may
an
alarming
change
for
the
worse
occurred
in
the
condition
of
his
heart
muscles
he
was
ordered
to
franzienbad
for
six
weeks
but
the
rest
did
him
no
good
on
june
he
left
with
his
wife
and
several
friends
for
edlach
in
semmering
he
knew
that
this
was
his
last
journey
then
there
was
a
slight
improvement
and
he
returned
to
his
desk
but
he
rapidly
grew
worse
to
the
faithful
hechler
he
said
give
them
all
my
greetings
and
tell
them
that
i
have
given
my
heart
blood
for
my
people
on
july
pneumonia
set
in
and
there
were
signs
of
approaching
exhaustion
his
mother
arrived
then
his
two
younger
children
hans
and
trude
at
five
in
the
afternoon
his
physician
who
had
taken
his
eyes
off
the
patient
for
a
moment
heard
a
deep
sigh
when
he
turned
he
saw
herzl
head
sunk
on
his
breast
in
his
will
herzl
asked
that
his
body
be
buried
next
to
his
father
to
remain
there
until
the
jewish
people
will
carry
my
remains
to
palestine
when
the
russians
entered
vienna
in
the
remains
of
herzl
were
still
there
jewish
by
the
idea
which
i
have
developed
in
this
pamphlet
is
a
very
old
one
it
is
the
restoration
of
the
jewish
state
the
world
resounds
with
outcries
against
the
jews
and
these
outcries
have
awakened
the
slumbering
idea
i
wish
it
to
be
clearly
understood
from
the
outset
that
no
portion
of
my
argument
is
based
on
a
new
discovery
i
have
discovered
neither
the
historic
condition
of
the
jews
nor
the
means
to
improve
it
in
fact
every
man
will
see
for
himself
that
the
materials
of
the
structure
i
am
designing
are
not
only
in
existence
but
actually
already
in
hand
if
therefore
this
attempt
to
solve
the
jewish
question
is
to
be
designated
by
a
single
word
let
it
be
said
to
be
the
result
of
an
inescapable
conclusion
rather
than
that
of
a
flighty
imagination
i
must
in
the
first
place
guard
my
scheme
from
being
treated
as
utopian
by
superficial
critics
who
might
commit
this
error
of
judgment
if
i
did
not
warn
them
i
should
obviously
have
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
if
i
had
described
a
utopia
on
philanthropic
lines
and
i
should
also
in
all
probability
have
obtained
literary
success
more
easily
if
i
had
set
forth
my
plan
in
the
irresponsible
guise
of
a
romantic
tale
but
this
utopia
is
far
less
attractive
than
any
one
of
those
portrayed
by
sir
thomas
more
and
his
numerous
forerunners
and
successors
and
i
believe
that
the
situation
of
the
jews
in
many
countries
is
grave
enough
to
make
such
preliminary
trifling
superfluous
an
interesting
book
freiland
by
theodor
hertzka
which
appeared
a
few
years
ago
may
serve
to
mark
the
distinction
i
draw
between
my
conception
and
a
utopia
his
is
the
ingenious
invention
of
a
modern
mind
thoroughly
schooled
in
the
principles
of
political
economy
it
is
as
remote
from
actuality
as
the
equatorial
mountain
on
which
his
dream
state
lies
freiland
is
a
complicated
piece
of
mechanism
with
numerous
cogged
wheels
fitting
into
each
other
but
there
is
nothing
to
prove
that
they
can
be
set
in
motion
even
supposing
freiland
societies
were
to
come
into
existence
i
should
look
on
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
the
present
scheme
on
the
other
hand
includes
the
employment
of
an
existent
propelling
force
in
consideration
of
my
own
inadequacy
i
shall
content
myself
with
indicating
the
cogs
and
wheels
of
the
machine
to
be
constructed
and
i
shall
rely
on
more
skilled
mechanicians
than
myself
to
put
them
together
everything
depends
on
our
propelling
force
and
what
is
that
force
the
misery
of
the
jews
who
would
venture
to
deny
its
existence
we
shall
discuss
it
fully
in
the
chapter
on
the
causes
of
everybody
is
familiar
with
the
phenomenon
of
generated
by
boiling
water
which
lifts
the
such
phenomena
are
the
attempts
of
zionist
and
kindred
associations
to
check
i
believe
that
this
power
if
rightly
employed
is
powerful
enough
to
propel
a
large
engine
and
to
move
passengers
and
goods
the
engine
having
whatever
form
men
may
choose
to
give
it
i
am
absolutely
convinced
that
i
am
right
though
i
doubt
whether
i
shall
live
to
see
myself
proved
to
be
so
those
who
are
the
first
to
inaugurate
this
movement
will
scarcely
live
to
see
its
glorious
close
but
the
inauguration
of
it
is
enough
to
give
them
a
feeling
of
pride
and
the
joy
of
spiritual
freedom
i
shall
not
be
lavish
in
artistically
elaborated
descriptions
of
my
project
for
fear
of
incurring
the
suspicion
of
painting
a
utopia
i
anticipate
in
any
case
that
thoughtless
scoffers
will
caricature
my
sketch
and
thus
try
to
weaken
its
effect
a
jew
intelligent
in
other
respects
to
whom
i
explained
my
plan
was
of
the
opinion
that
a
utopia
was
a
project
whose
future
details
were
represented
as
already
extant
this
is
a
fallacy
every
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
calculates
in
his
budget
estimates
with
assumed
figures
and
not
only
with
such
as
are
based
on
the
average
returns
of
past
years
or
on
previous
revenues
in
other
states
but
sometimes
with
figures
for
which
there
is
no
precedent
whatever
as
for
example
in
instituting
a
new
tax
everybody
who
studies
a
budget
knows
that
this
is
the
case
but
even
if
it
were
known
that
the
estimates
would
not
be
rigidly
adhered
to
would
such
a
financial
draft
be
considered
utopian
but
i
am
expecting
more
of
my
readers
i
ask
the
cultivated
men
whom
i
am
addressing
to
set
many
preconceived
ideas
entirely
aside
i
shall
even
go
so
far
as
to
ask
those
jews
who
have
most
earnestly
tried
to
solve
the
jewish
question
to
look
upon
their
previous
attempts
as
mistaken
and
futile
i
must
guard
against
a
danger
in
setting
forth
my
idea
if
i
describe
future
circumstances
with
too
much
caution
i
shall
appear
to
doubt
their
possibility
if
on
the
other
hand
i
announce
their
realization
with
too
much
assurance
i
shall
appear
to
be
describing
a
chimera
i
shall
therefore
clearly
and
emphatically
state
that
i
believe
in
the
practical
outcome
of
my
scheme
though
without
professing
to
have
discovered
the
shape
it
may
ultimately
take
the
jewish
state
is
essential
to
the
world
it
will
therefore
be
created
the
plan
would
of
course
seem
absurd
if
a
single
individual
attempted
to
do
it
but
if
worked
by
a
number
of
jews
in
it
would
appear
perfectly
rational
and
its
accomplishment
would
present
no
difficulties
worth
mentioning
the
idea
depends
only
on
the
number
of
its
supporters
perhaps
our
ambitious
young
men
to
whom
every
road
of
progress
is
now
closed
seeing
in
this
jewish
state
a
bright
prospect
of
freedom
happiness
and
honors
opening
to
them
will
ensure
the
propagation
of
the
idea
i
feel
that
with
the
publication
of
this
pamphlet
my
task
is
done
i
shall
not
again
take
up
the
pen
unless
the
attacks
of
noteworthy
antagonists
drive
me
to
do
so
or
it
becomes
necessary
to
meet
unforeseen
objections
and
to
remove
errors
am
i
stating
what
is
not
yet
the
case
am
i
before
my
time
are
the
sufferings
of
the
jews
not
yet
grave
enough
we
shall
see
it
depends
on
the
jews
themselves
whether
this
political
pamphlet
remains
for
the
present
a
political
romance
if
the
present
generation
is
too
dull
to
understand
it
rightly
a
future
finer
and
a
better
generation
will
arise
to
understand
it
the
jews
who
wish
for
a
state
shall
have
it
and
they
will
deserve
to
have
it
it
is
astonishing
how
little
insight
into
the
science
of
economics
many
of
the
men
who
move
in
the
midst
of
active
life
possess
hence
it
is
that
even
jews
faithfully
repeat
the
cry
of
the
we
depend
for
sustenance
on
the
nations
who
are
our
hosts
and
if
we
had
no
hosts
to
support
us
we
should
die
of
starvation
this
is
a
point
that
shows
how
unjust
accusations
may
weaken
our
but
what
are
the
true
grounds
for
this
statement
concerning
the
nations
that
act
as
hosts
where
it
is
not
based
on
limited
physiocratic
views
it
is
founded
on
the
childish
error
that
commodities
pass
from
hand
to
hand
in
continuous
rotation
we
need
not
wake
from
long
slumber
like
rip
van
winkle
to
realize
that
the
world
is
considerably
altered
by
the
production
of
new
commodities
the
technical
progress
made
during
this
wonderful
era
enables
even
a
man
of
most
limited
intelligence
to
note
with
his
eyes
the
appearance
of
new
commodities
all
around
him
the
spirit
of
enterprise
has
created
them
labor
without
enterprise
is
the
stationary
labor
of
ancient
days
and
typical
of
it
is
the
work
of
the
husbandman
who
stands
now
just
where
his
progenitors
stood
a
thousand
years
ago
all
our
material
welfare
has
been
brought
about
by
men
of
enterprise
i
feel
almost
ashamed
of
writing
down
so
trite
a
remark
even
if
we
were
a
nation
of
entrepreneurs
such
as
absurdly
exaggerated
accounts
make
us
out
to
be
we
should
not
require
another
nation
to
live
on
we
do
not
depend
on
the
circulation
of
old
commodities
because
we
produce
new
ones
the
world
possesses
slaves
of
extraordinary
capacity
for
work
whose
appearance
has
been
fatal
to
the
production
of
handmade
goods
these
slaves
are
the
machines
it
is
true
that
workmen
are
required
to
set
machinery
in
motion
but
for
this
we
have
men
in
plenty
in
only
those
who
are
ignorant
of
the
conditions
of
jews
in
many
countries
of
eastern
europe
would
venture
to
assert
that
jews
are
either
unfit
or
unwilling
to
perform
manual
labor
but
i
do
not
wish
to
take
up
the
cudgels
for
the
jews
in
this
pamphlet
it
would
be
useless
everything
rational
and
everything
sentimental
that
can
possibly
be
said
in
their
defence
has
been
said
already
if
one
hearers
are
incapable
of
comprehending
them
one
is
a
preacher
in
a
desert
and
if
one
hearers
are
broad
and
enough
to
have
grasped
them
already
then
the
sermon
is
superfluous
i
believe
in
the
ascent
of
man
to
higher
and
yet
higher
grades
of
civilization
but
i
consider
this
ascent
to
be
desperately
slow
were
we
to
wait
till
average
humanity
had
become
as
charitably
inclined
as
was
lessing
when
he
wrote
nathan
the
wise
we
should
wait
beyond
our
day
beyond
the
days
of
our
children
of
our
grandchildren
and
of
our
but
the
world
spirit
comes
to
our
aid
in
another
way
this
century
has
given
the
world
a
wonderful
renaissance
by
means
of
its
technical
achievements
but
at
the
same
time
its
miraculous
improvements
have
not
been
employed
in
the
service
of
humanity
distance
has
ceased
to
be
an
obstacle
yet
we
complain
of
insufficient
space
our
great
steamships
carry
us
swiftly
and
surely
over
hitherto
unvisited
seas
our
railways
carry
us
safely
into
a
hitherto
tremblingly
scaled
on
foot
events
occurring
in
countries
undiscovered
when
europe
confined
the
jews
in
ghettos
are
known
to
us
in
the
course
of
an
hour
hence
the
misery
of
the
jews
is
an
anachronism
not
because
there
was
a
period
of
enlightenment
one
hundred
years
ago
for
that
enlightenment
reached
in
reality
only
the
choicest
spirits
i
believe
that
electric
light
was
not
invented
for
the
purpose
of
illuminating
the
of
a
few
snobs
but
rather
for
the
purpose
of
throwing
light
on
some
of
the
dark
problems
of
humanity
one
of
these
problems
and
not
the
least
of
them
is
the
jewish
question
in
solving
it
we
are
working
not
only
for
ourselves
but
also
for
many
other
and
oppressed
beings
the
jewish
question
still
exists
it
would
be
foolish
to
deny
it
it
is
a
remnant
of
the
middle
ages
which
civilized
nations
do
not
even
yet
seem
able
to
shake
off
try
as
they
will
they
certainly
showed
a
generous
desire
to
do
so
when
they
emancipated
us
the
jewish
question
exists
wherever
jews
live
in
perceptible
numbers
where
it
does
not
exist
it
is
carried
by
jews
in
the
course
of
their
migrations
we
naturally
move
to
those
places
where
we
are
not
persecuted
and
there
our
presence
produces
persecution
this
is
the
case
in
every
country
and
will
remain
so
even
in
those
highly
civilized
for
instance
france
until
the
jewish
question
finds
a
solution
on
a
political
basis
the
unfortunate
jews
are
now
carrying
the
seeds
of
into
england
they
have
already
introduced
it
into
america
i
believe
that
i
understand
which
is
really
a
highly
complex
movement
i
consider
it
from
a
jewish
standpoint
yet
without
fear
or
hatred
i
believe
that
i
can
see
what
elements
there
are
in
it
of
vulgar
sport
of
common
trade
jealousy
of
inherited
prejudice
of
religious
intolerance
and
also
of
pretended
i
think
the
jewish
question
is
no
more
a
social
than
a
religious
one
notwithstanding
that
it
sometimes
takes
these
and
other
forms
it
is
a
national
question
which
can
only
be
solved
by
making
it
a
political
to
be
discussed
and
settled
by
the
civilized
nations
of
the
world
in
council
we
are
a
people
one
people
we
have
honestly
endeavored
everywhere
to
merge
ourselves
in
the
social
life
of
surrounding
communities
and
to
preserve
the
faith
of
our
fathers
we
are
not
permitted
to
do
so
in
vain
are
we
loyal
patriots
our
loyalty
in
some
places
running
to
extremes
in
vain
do
we
make
the
same
sacrifices
of
life
and
property
as
our
in
vain
do
we
strive
to
increase
the
fame
of
our
native
land
in
science
and
art
or
her
wealth
by
trade
and
commerce
in
countries
where
we
have
lived
for
centuries
we
are
still
cried
down
as
strangers
and
often
by
those
whose
ancestors
were
not
yet
domiciled
in
the
land
where
jews
had
already
had
experience
of
suffering
the
majority
may
decide
which
are
the
strangers
for
this
as
indeed
every
point
which
arises
in
the
relations
between
nations
is
a
question
of
might
i
do
not
here
surrender
any
portion
of
our
prescriptive
right
when
i
make
this
statement
merely
in
my
own
name
as
an
individual
in
the
world
as
it
now
is
and
for
an
indefinite
period
will
probably
remain
might
precedes
right
it
is
useless
therefore
for
us
to
be
loyal
patriots
as
were
the
huguenots
who
were
forced
to
emigrate
if
we
could
only
be
left
in
peace
but
i
think
we
shall
not
be
left
in
peace
oppression
and
persecution
can
not
exterminate
us
no
nation
on
earth
has
survived
such
struggles
and
sufferings
as
we
have
gone
through
has
merely
stripped
off
our
weaklings
the
strong
among
us
were
invariably
true
to
their
race
when
persecution
broke
out
against
them
this
attitude
was
most
clearly
apparent
in
the
period
immediately
following
the
emancipation
of
the
jews
those
jews
who
were
advanced
intellectually
and
materially
entirely
lost
the
feeling
of
belonging
to
their
race
wherever
our
political
has
lasted
for
any
length
of
time
we
have
assimilated
with
our
surroundings
i
think
this
is
not
discreditable
hence
the
statesman
who
would
wish
to
see
a
jewish
strain
in
his
nation
would
have
to
provide
for
the
duration
of
our
political
and
even
a
bismarck
could
not
do
that
for
old
prejudices
against
us
still
lie
deep
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
he
who
would
have
proofs
of
this
need
only
listen
to
the
people
where
they
speak
with
frankness
and
simplicity
proverb
and
are
both
a
nation
is
everywhere
a
great
child
which
can
certainly
be
educated
but
its
education
would
even
in
most
favorable
circumstances
occupy
such
a
vast
amount
of
time
that
we
could
as
already
mentioned
remove
our
own
difficulties
by
other
means
long
before
the
process
was
accomplished
assimilation
by
which
i
understood
not
only
external
conformity
in
dress
habits
customs
and
language
but
also
identity
of
feeling
and
manner
assimilation
of
jews
could
be
effected
only
by
intermarriage
but
the
need
for
mixed
marriages
would
have
to
be
felt
by
the
majority
their
mere
recognition
by
law
would
certainly
not
suffice
the
hungarian
liberals
who
have
just
given
legal
sanction
to
mixed
marriages
have
made
a
remarkable
mistake
which
one
of
the
earliest
cases
clearly
illustrates
a
baptized
jew
married
a
jewess
at
the
same
time
the
struggle
to
obtain
the
present
form
of
marriage
accentuated
distinctions
between
jews
and
christians
thus
hindering
rather
than
aiding
the
fusion
of
races
those
who
really
wished
to
see
the
jews
disappear
through
intermixture
with
other
nations
can
only
hope
to
see
it
come
about
in
one
way
the
jews
must
previously
acquire
economic
power
sufficiently
great
to
overcome
the
old
social
prejudice
against
them
the
aristocracy
may
serve
as
an
example
of
this
for
in
its
ranks
occur
the
proportionately
largest
numbers
of
mixed
marriages
the
jewish
families
which
regild
the
old
nobility
with
their
money
become
gradually
absorbed
but
what
form
would
this
phenomenon
assume
in
the
middle
classes
where
the
jews
being
a
bourgeois
people
the
jewish
question
is
mainly
concentrated
a
previous
acquisition
of
power
could
be
synonymous
with
that
economic
supremacy
which
jews
are
already
erroneously
declared
to
possess
and
if
the
power
they
now
possess
creates
rage
and
indignation
among
the
what
outbreaks
would
such
an
increase
of
power
create
hence
the
first
step
towards
absorption
will
never
be
taken
because
this
step
would
involve
the
subjection
of
the
majority
to
a
hitherto
scorned
minority
possessing
neither
military
nor
administrative
power
of
its
own
i
think
therefore
that
the
absorption
of
jews
by
means
of
their
prosperity
is
unlikely
to
occur
in
countries
which
now
are
my
view
will
be
approved
in
others
where
jews
now
feel
comfortable
it
will
probably
be
violently
disputed
by
them
my
happier
will
not
believe
me
till
teaches
them
the
truth
for
the
longer
lies
in
abeyance
the
more
fiercely
will
it
break
out
the
infiltration
of
immigrating
jews
attracted
to
a
land
by
apparent
security
and
the
ascent
in
the
social
scale
of
native
jews
combine
powerfully
to
bring
about
a
revolution
nothing
is
plainer
than
this
rational
conclusion
because
i
have
drawn
this
conclusion
with
complete
indifference
to
everything
but
the
quest
of
truth
i
shall
probably
be
contradicted
and
opposed
by
jews
who
are
in
easy
circumstances
insofar
as
private
interests
alone
are
held
by
their
anxious
or
timid
possessors
to
be
in
danger
they
can
safely
be
ignored
for
the
concerns
of
the
poor
and
oppressed
are
of
greater
importance
than
theirs
but
i
wish
from
the
outset
to
prevent
any
misconception
from
arising
particularly
the
mistaken
notion
that
my
project
if
realized
would
in
the
least
degree
injure
property
now
held
by
jews
i
shall
therefore
explain
everything
connected
with
rights
of
property
very
fully
whereas
if
my
plan
never
becomes
anything
more
than
a
piece
of
literature
things
will
merely
remain
as
they
are
it
might
more
reasonably
be
objected
that
i
am
giving
a
handle
to
when
i
say
we
are
a
people
one
people
that
i
am
hindering
the
assimilation
of
jews
where
it
is
about
to
be
consummated
and
endangering
it
where
it
is
an
accomplished
fact
insofar
as
it
is
possible
for
a
solitary
writer
to
hinder
or
endanger
anything
this
objection
will
be
especially
brought
forward
in
france
it
will
probably
also
be
made
in
other
countries
but
i
shall
answer
only
the
french
jews
beforehand
because
these
afford
the
most
striking
example
of
my
point
however
much
i
may
worship
personality
powerful
individual
personality
in
statesmen
inventors
artists
philosophers
or
leaders
as
well
as
the
collective
personality
of
a
historic
group
of
human
beings
which
we
call
a
nation
however
much
i
may
worship
personality
i
do
not
regret
its
disappearance
whoever
can
will
and
must
perish
let
him
perish
but
the
distinctive
nationality
of
jews
neither
can
will
nor
must
be
destroyed
it
can
not
be
destroyed
because
external
enemies
consolidate
it
it
will
not
be
destroyed
this
is
shown
during
two
thousand
years
of
appalling
suffering
it
must
not
be
destroyed
and
that
as
a
descendant
of
numberless
jews
who
refused
to
despair
i
am
trying
once
more
to
prove
in
this
pamphlet
whole
branches
of
judaism
may
wither
and
fall
but
the
trunk
will
remain
hence
if
all
or
any
of
the
french
jews
protest
against
this
scheme
on
account
of
their
own
assimilation
my
answer
is
simple
the
whole
thing
does
not
concern
them
at
all
they
are
jewish
frenchmen
well
and
good
this
is
a
private
affair
for
the
jews
alone
the
movement
towards
the
organization
of
the
state
i
am
proposing
would
of
course
harm
jewish
frenchmen
no
more
than
it
would
harm
the
assimilated
of
other
countries
it
would
on
the
contrary
be
distinctly
to
their
advantage
for
they
would
no
longer
be
disturbed
in
their
chromatic
function
as
darwin
puts
it
but
would
be
able
to
assimilate
in
peace
because
the
present
would
have
been
stopped
for
ever
they
would
certainly
be
credited
with
being
assimilated
to
the
very
depths
of
their
souls
if
they
stayed
where
they
were
after
the
new
jewish
state
with
its
superior
institutions
had
become
a
reality
the
assimilated
would
profit
even
more
than
christian
citizens
by
the
departure
of
faithful
jews
for
they
would
be
rid
of
the
disquieting
incalculable
and
unavoidable
rivalry
of
a
jewish
proletariat
driven
by
poverty
and
political
pressure
from
place
to
place
from
land
to
land
this
floating
proletariat
would
become
stationary
many
christian
citizens
whom
we
call
can
now
offer
determined
resistance
to
the
immigration
of
foreign
jews
jewish
citizens
can
not
do
this
although
it
affects
them
far
more
directly
for
on
them
they
feel
first
of
all
the
keen
competition
of
individuals
carrying
on
similar
branches
of
industry
who
in
addition
either
introduce
where
it
does
not
exist
or
intensify
it
where
it
does
the
assimilated
give
expression
to
this
secret
grievance
in
philanthropic
undertakings
they
organize
emigration
societies
for
wandering
jews
there
is
a
reverse
to
the
picture
which
would
be
comic
if
it
did
not
deal
with
human
beings
for
some
of
these
charitable
institutions
are
created
not
for
but
against
persecuted
jews
they
are
created
to
despatch
these
poor
creatures
just
as
fast
and
far
as
possible
and
thus
many
an
apparent
friend
of
the
jews
turns
out
on
careful
inspection
to
be
nothing
more
than
an
of
jewish
origin
disguised
as
a
philanthropist
but
the
attempts
at
colonization
made
even
by
really
benevolent
men
interesting
attempts
though
they
were
have
so
far
been
unsuccessful
i
do
not
think
that
this
or
that
man
took
up
the
matter
merely
as
an
amusement
that
they
engaged
in
the
emigration
of
poor
jews
as
one
indulges
in
the
racing
of
horses
the
matter
was
too
grave
and
tragic
for
such
treatment
these
attempts
were
interesting
in
that
they
represented
on
a
small
scale
the
practical
of
the
idea
of
a
jewish
state
they
were
even
useful
for
out
of
their
mistakes
may
be
gathered
experience
for
carrying
the
idea
out
successfully
on
a
larger
scale
they
have
of
course
done
harm
also
the
transportation
of
to
new
districts
which
is
the
inevitable
consequence
of
such
artificial
infiltration
seems
to
me
to
be
the
least
of
these
evils
far
worse
is
the
circumstance
that
unsatisfactory
results
tend
to
cast
doubts
on
intelligent
men
what
is
impractical
or
impossible
to
simple
argument
will
remove
this
doubt
from
the
minds
of
intelligent
men
what
is
unpractical
or
impossible
to
accomplish
on
a
small
scale
need
not
necessarily
be
so
on
a
larger
one
a
small
enterprise
may
result
in
loss
under
the
same
conditions
which
would
make
a
large
one
pay
a
rivulet
can
not
even
be
navigated
by
boats
the
river
into
which
it
flows
carries
stately
iron
vessels
no
human
being
is
wealthy
or
powerful
enough
to
transplant
a
nation
from
one
habitation
to
another
an
idea
alone
can
achieve
that
and
this
idea
of
a
state
may
have
the
requisite
power
to
do
so
the
jews
have
dreamt
this
kingly
dream
all
through
the
long
nights
of
their
history
next
year
in
jerusalem
is
our
old
phrase
it
is
now
a
question
of
showing
that
the
dream
can
be
converted
into
a
living
reality
for
this
many
old
outgrown
confused
and
limited
notions
must
first
be
entirely
erased
from
the
minds
of
men
dull
brains
might
for
instance
imagine
that
this
exodus
would
be
from
civilized
regions
into
the
desert
that
is
not
the
case
it
will
be
carried
out
in
the
midst
of
civilization
we
shall
not
revert
to
a
lower
stage
we
shall
rise
to
a
higher
one
we
shall
not
dwell
in
mud
huts
we
shall
build
new
more
beautiful
and
more
modern
houses
and
possess
them
in
safety
we
shall
not
lose
our
acquired
possessions
we
shall
realize
them
we
shall
surrender
our
well
earned
rights
only
for
better
ones
we
shall
not
sacrifice
our
beloved
customs
we
shall
find
them
again
we
shall
not
leave
our
old
home
before
the
new
one
is
prepared
for
us
those
only
will
depart
who
are
sure
thereby
to
improve
their
position
those
who
are
now
desperate
will
go
first
after
them
the
poor
next
the
prosperous
and
last
of
all
the
wealthy
those
who
go
in
advance
will
raise
themselves
to
a
higher
grade
equal
to
those
whose
representatives
will
shortly
follow
thus
the
exodus
will
be
at
the
same
time
an
ascent
of
the
class
the
departure
of
the
jews
will
involve
no
economic
disturbances
no
crises
no
persecutions
in
fact
the
countries
they
abandon
will
revive
to
a
new
period
of
prosperity
there
will
be
an
inner
migration
of
christian
citizens
into
the
positions
evacuated
by
jews
the
outgoing
current
will
be
gradual
without
any
disturbance
and
its
initial
movement
will
put
an
end
to
the
jews
will
leave
as
honored
friends
and
if
some
of
them
return
they
will
receive
the
same
favorable
welcome
and
treatment
at
the
hands
of
civilized
nations
as
is
accorded
to
all
foreign
visitors
their
exodus
will
have
no
resemblance
to
a
flight
for
it
will
be
a
movement
under
control
of
public
opinion
the
movement
will
not
only
be
inaugurated
with
absolute
conformity
to
law
but
it
can
not
even
be
carried
out
without
the
friendly
cooperation
of
interested
governments
who
would
derive
considerable
benefits
from
it
security
for
the
integrity
of
the
idea
and
the
vigor
of
its
execution
will
be
found
in
the
creation
of
a
body
corporate
or
corporation
this
corporation
will
be
called
the
society
of
jews
in
addition
to
it
there
will
be
a
jewish
company
an
economically
productive
body
an
individual
who
attempted
even
to
undertake
this
huge
task
alone
would
be
either
an
impostor
or
a
madman
the
personal
character
of
the
members
of
the
corporation
will
guarantee
its
integrity
and
the
adequate
capital
of
the
company
will
prove
its
stability
these
prefatory
remarks
are
merely
intended
as
a
hasty
reply
to
the
mass
of
objections
which
the
very
words
jewish
state
are
certain
to
arouse
henceforth
we
shall
proceed
more
slowly
to
meet
further
objections
and
to
explain
in
detail
what
has
been
as
yet
only
indicated
and
we
shall
try
in
the
interests
of
this
pamphlet
to
avoid
making
it
a
dull
exposition
short
aphoristic
chapters
will
therefore
best
answer
the
purpose
if
i
wish
to
substitute
a
new
building
for
an
old
one
i
must
demolish
before
i
construct
i
shall
therefore
keep
to
this
natural
sequence
in
the
first
and
general
part
i
shall
explain
my
ideas
remove
all
prejudices
determine
essential
political
and
economic
conditions
and
develop
the
plan
in
the
special
part
which
is
divided
into
three
principal
sections
i
shall
describe
its
execution
these
three
sections
are
the
jewish
company
local
groups
and
the
society
of
jews
the
society
is
to
be
created
first
the
company
last
but
in
this
exposition
the
reverse
order
is
preferable
because
it
is
the
financial
soundness
of
the
enterprise
which
will
chiefly
be
called
into
question
and
doubts
on
this
score
must
be
removed
first
in
the
conclusion
i
shall
try
to
meet
every
further
objection
that
could
possibly
be
made
my
jewish
readers
will
i
hope
follow
me
patiently
to
the
end
some
will
naturally
make
their
objections
in
an
order
of
succession
other
than
that
chosen
for
their
refutation
but
whoever
finds
his
doubts
dispelled
should
give
allegiance
to
the
cause
although
i
speak
of
reason
i
am
fully
aware
that
reason
alone
will
not
suffice
old
prisoners
do
not
willingly
leave
their
cells
we
shall
see
whether
the
youth
whom
we
need
are
at
our
command
the
youth
who
irresistibly
draw
on
the
old
carry
them
forward
on
strong
arms
and
transform
rational
motives
into
enthusiasm
the
jewish
no
one
can
deny
the
gravity
of
the
situation
of
the
jews
wherever
they
live
in
perceptible
numbers
they
are
more
or
less
persecuted
their
equality
before
the
law
granted
by
statute
has
become
practically
a
dead
letter
they
are
debarred
from
filling
even
moderately
high
positions
either
in
the
army
or
in
any
public
or
private
capacity
and
attempts
are
made
to
thrust
them
out
of
business
also
do
buy
from
jews
attacks
in
parliaments
in
assemblies
in
the
press
in
the
pulpit
in
the
street
on
journeys
for
example
their
exclusion
from
certain
hotels
even
in
places
of
recreation
become
daily
more
numerous
the
forms
of
persecutions
varying
according
to
the
countries
and
social
circles
in
which
they
occur
in
russia
imposts
are
levied
on
jewish
villages
in
rumania
a
few
persons
are
put
to
death
in
germany
they
get
a
good
beating
occasionally
in
austria
exercise
terrorism
over
all

life
in

there
are
travelling
agitators
in
paris
the
jews
are
shut
out
of
the
best
social
circles
and
excluded
from
clubs
shades
of
feeling
are
innumerable
but
this
is
not
to
be
an
attempt
to
make
out
a
doleful
category
of
jewish
hardships
i
do
not
intend
to
arouse
sympathetic
emotions
on
our
behalf
that
would
be
foolish
futile
and
undignified
proceeding
i
shall
content
myself
with
putting
the
following
questions
to
the
jews
is
it
not
true
that
in
countries
where
we
live
in
perceptible
numbers
the
position
of
jewish
lawyers
doctors
technicians
teachers
and
employees
of
all
descriptions
becomes
daily
more
intolerable
is
it
not
true
that
the
jewish
middle
classes
are
seriously
threatened
is
it
not
true
that
the
passions
of
the
mob
are
incited
against
our
wealthy
people
is
it
not
true
that
our
poor
endure
greater
sufferings
than
any
other
proletariat
i
think
that
this
external
pressure
makes
itself
felt
everywhere
in
our
economically
upper
classes
it
causes
discomfort
in
our
middle
classes
continual
and
grave
anxieties
in
our
lower
classes
absolute
despair
everything
tends
in
fact
to
one
and
the
same
conclusion
which
is
clearly
enunciated
in
that
classic
berlin
phrase
raus
out
with
the
jews
i
shall
now
put
the
question
in
the
briefest
possible
form
are
we
to
get
out
now
and
where
to
or
may
we
yet
remain
and
how
long
let
us
first
settle
the
point
of
staying
where
we
are
can
we
hope
for
better
days
can
we
possess
our
souls
in
patience
can
we
wait
in
pious
resignation
till
the
princes
and
peoples
of
this
earth
are
more
mercifully
disposed
towards
us
i
say
that
we
can
not
hope
for
a
change
in
the
current
of
feeling
and
why
not
even
if
we
were
as
near
to
the
hearts
of
princes
as
are
their
other
subjects
they
could
not
protect
us
they
would
only
feel
popular
hatred
by
showing
us
too
much
favor
by
too
much
i
really
mean
less
than
is
claimed
as
a
right
by
every
ordinary
citizen
or
by
every
race
the
nations
in
whose
midst
jews
live
are
all
either
covertly
or
openly
the
common
people
have
not
and
indeed
can
not
have
any
historic
comprehension
they
do
not
know
that
the
sins
of
the
middle
ages
are
now
being
visited
on
the
nations
of
europe
we
are
what
the
ghetto
made
us
we
have
attained
in
finance
because
mediaeval
conditions
drove
us
to
it
the
same
process
is
now
being
repeated
we
are
again
being
forced
into
finance
now
it
is
the
stock
exchange
by
being
kept
out
of
other
branches
of
economic
activity
being
on
the
stock
exchange
we
are
consequently
exposed
afresh
to
contempt
at
the
same
time
we
continue
to
produce
an
abundance
of
mediocre
intellects
who
find
no
outlet
and
this
endangers
our
social
position
as
much
as
does
our
increasing
wealth
educated
jews
without
means
are
now
rapidly
becoming
socialists
hence
we
are
certain
to
suffer
very
severely
in
the
struggle
between
classes
because
we
stand
in
the
most
exposed
position
in
the
camps
of
both
socialists
and
capitalists
previous
attempts
at
a
solution
the
artificial
means
heretofore
employed
to
overcome
the
troubles
of
jews
have
been
either
too
petty
such
as
attempts
at
colonization
or
attempts
to
convert
the
jews
into
peasants
in
their
present
homes
what
is
achieved
by
transporting
a
few
thousand
jews
to
another
country
either
they
come
to
grief
at
once
or
prosper
and
then
their
prosperity
creates
we
have
already
discussed
these
attempts
to
divert
poor
jews
to
fresh
districts
this
diversion
is
clearly
inadequate
and
futile
if
it
does
not
actually
defeat
its
own
ends
for
it
merely
protracts
and
postpones
a
solution
and
perhaps
even
aggravates
difficulties
whoever
would
attempt
to
convert
the
jew
into
a
husbandman
would
be
making
an
extraordinary
mistake
for
a
peasant
is
in
a
historical
category
as
proved
by
his
costume
which
in
some
countries
he
has
worn
for
centuries
and
by
his
tools
which
are
identical
with
those
used
by
his
earliest
forefathers
his
plough
is
unchanged
he
carries
the
seed
in
his
apron
mows
with
the
historical
scythe
and
threshes
with
the
flail
but
we
know
that
all
this
can
be
done
by
machinery
the
agrarian
question
is
only
a
question
of
machinery
america
must
conquer
europe
in
the
same
way
as
large
landed
possessions
absorb
small
ones
the
peasant
is
consequently
a
type
which
is
in
course
of
extinction
whenever
he
is
artificially
preserved
it
is
done
on
account
of
the
political
interests
which
he
is
intended
to
serve
it
is
absurd
and
indeed
impossible
to
make
modern
peasants
on
the
old
pattern
no
one
is
wealthy
or
powerful
enough
to
make
civilization
take
a
single
retrograde
step
the
mere
preservation
of
obsolete
institutions
is
a
task
severe
enough
to
require
the
enforcement
of
all
the
despotic
measures
of
an
autocratically
governed
state
are
we
therefore
to
credit
jews
who
are
intelligent
with
a
desire
to
become
peasants
of
the
old
type
one
might
just
as
well
say
to
them
here
is
a
now
go
to
war
what
with
a
while
the
others
have
rifles
and
long
range
guns
under
these
circumstances
the
jews
are
perfectly
justified
in
refusing
to
stir
when
people
try
to
make
peasants
of
them
a
is
a
beautiful
weapon
which
inspires
me
with
mournful
feelings
when
i
have
time
to
devote
to
them
but
it
belongs
by
rights
to
a
museum
now
there
certainly
are
districts
to
which
desperate
jews
go
out
or
at
any
rate
are
willing
to
go
out
and
till
the
soil
and
a
little
observation
shows
that
these
districts
such
as
the
enclave
of
hesse
in
germany
and
some
provinces
in
russia
these
very
districts
are
the
principal
seats
of
for
the
world
reformers
who
send
the
jews
to
the
plough
forget
a
very
important
person
who
has
a
great
deal
to
say
on
the
matter
this
person
is
the
agriculturist
and
the
agriculturist
is
also
perfectly
justified
for
the
tax
on
land
the
risks
attached
to
crops
the
pressure
of
large
proprietors
who
cheapen
labor
and
american
competition
in
particular
combine
to
make
his
life
hard
enough
besides
the
duties
on
corn
can
not
go
on
increasing
indefinitely
nor
can
the
manufacturer
be
allowed
to
starve
his
political
influence
is
in
fact
in
the
ascendant
and
he
must
therefore
be
treated
with
additional
consideration
all
these
difficulties
are
well
known
therefore
i
refer
to
them
only
cursorily
i
merely
wanted
to
indicate
clearly
how
futile
had
been
past
attempts
most
of
them
well
intentioned
to
solve
the
jewish
question
neither
a
diversion
of
the
stream
nor
an
artificial
depression
of
the
intellectual
level
of
our
proletariat
will
overcome
the
difficulty
the
supposed
infallible
expedient
of
assimilation
has
already
been
dealt
with
we
can
not
get
the
better
of
by
any
of
these
methods
it
can
not
die
out
so
long
as
its
causes
are
not
removed
are
they
removable
causes
of
we
shall
not
again
touch
on
those
causes
which
are
a
result
of
temperament
prejudice
and
narrow
views
but
shall
here
restrict
ourselves
to
political
and
economical
causes
alone
modern
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
religious
persecution
of
the
jews
of
former
times
it
does
occasionally
take
a
religious
bias
in
some
countries
but
the
main
current
of
the
aggressive
movement
has
now
changed
in
the
principal
countries
where
prevails
it
does
so
as
a
result
of
the
emancipation
of
the
jews
when
civilized
nations
awoke
to
the
inhumanity
of
discriminatory
legislation
and
enfranchised
us
our
enfranchisement
came
too
late
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
remove
our
disabilities
in
our
old
homes
for
we
had
curiously
enough
developed
while
in
the
ghetto
into
a
bourgeois
people
and
we
stepped
out
of
it
only
to
enter
into
fierce
competition
with
the
middle
classes
hence
our
emancipation
set
us
suddenly
within
this
circle
where
we
have
a
double
pressure
to
sustain
from
within
and
from
without
the
christian
bourgeoisie
would
not
be
unwilling
to
cast
us
as
a
sacrifice
to
socialism
though
that
would
not
greatly
improve
matters
at
the
same
time
the
equal
rights
of
jews
before
the
law
can
not
be
withdrawn
where
they
have
once
been
conceded
not
only
because
their
withdrawal
would
be
opposed
to
the
spirit
of
our
age
but
also
because
it
would
immediately
drive
all
jews
rich
and
poor
alike
into
the
ranks
of
subversive
parties
nothing
effectual
can
really
be
done
to
our
injury
in
olden
days
our
jewels
were
seized
how
is
our
movable
property
to
be
got
hold
of
now
it
consists
of
printed
papers
which
are
locked
up
somewhere
or
other
in
the
world
perhaps
in
the
coffers
of
christians
it
is
of
course
possible
to
get
at
shares
and
debentures
in
railways
banks
and
industrial
undertakings
of
all
descriptions
by
taxation
and
where
the
progressive
is
in
force
all
our
movable
property
can
eventually
be
laid
hold
of
but
all
these
efforts
can
not
be
directed
against
jews
alone
and
wherever
they
might
nevertheless
be
made
severe
economic
crises
would
be
their
immediate
consequences
which
would
be
by
no
means
confined
to
the
jews
who
would
be
the
first
affected
the
very
impossibility
of
getting
at
the
jews
nourishes
and
embitters
hatred
of
them
increases
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
among
the
nations
indeed
it
is
bound
to
increase
because
the
causes
of
its
growth
continue
to
exist
and
can
not
be
removed
its
remote
cause
is
our
loss
of
the
power
of
assimilation
during
the
middle
ages
its
immediate
cause
is
our
excessive
production
of
mediocre
intellects
who
can
not
find
an
outlet
downwards
or
upwards
that
is
to
say
no
wholesome
outlet
in
either
direction
when
we
sink
we
become
a
revolutionary
proletariat
the
subordinate
officers
of
all
revolutionary
parties
and
at
the
same
time
when
we
rise
there
rises
also
our
terrible
power
of
the
purse
effects
of
the
oppression
we
endure
does
not
improve
us
for
we
are
not
a
whit
better
than
ordinary
people
it
is
true
that
we
do
not
love
our
enemies
but
he
alone
who
can
conquer
himself
dare
reproach
us
with
that
fault
oppression
naturally
creates
hostility
against
oppressors
and
our
hostility
aggravates
the
pressure
it
is
impossible
to
escape
from
this
eternal
circle
no
some
visionaries
will
say
no
it
is
possible
possible
by
means
of
the
ultimate
perfection
of
humanity
is
it
necessary
to
point
to
the
sentimental
folly
of
this
view
he
who
would
found
his
hope
for
improved
conditions
on
the
ultimate
perfection
of
humanity
would
indeed
be
relying
upon
a
utopia
i
referred
previously
to
our
assimilation
i
do
not
for
a
moment
wish
to
imply
that
i
desire
such
an
end
our
national
character
is
too
historically
famous
and
in
spite
of
every
degradation
too
fine
to
make
its
annihilation
desirable
we
might
perhaps
be
able
to
merge
ourselves
entirely
into
surrounding
races
if
these
were
to
leave
us
in
peace
for
a
period
of
two
generations
but
they
will
not
leave
us
in
peace
for
a
little
period
they
manage
to
tolerate
us
and
then
their
hostility
breaks
out
again
and
again
the
world
is
provoked
somehow
by
our
prosperity
because
it
has
for
many
centuries
been
accustomed
to
consider
us
as
the
most
contemptible
among
the
in
its
ignorance
and
narrowness
of
heart
it
fails
to
observe
that
prosperity
weakens
our
judaism
and
extinguishes
our
peculiarities
it
is
only
pressure
that
forces
us
back
to
the
parent
stem
it
is
only
hatred
encompassing
us
that
makes
us
strangers
once
more
thus
whether
we
like
it
or
not
we
are
now
and
shall
henceforth
remain
a
historic
group
with
unmistakable
characteristics
common
to
us
all
we
are
one
people
our
enemies
have
made
us
one
without
our
consent
as
repeatedly
happens
in
history
distress
binds
us
together
and
thus
united
we
suddenly
discover
our
strength
yes
we
are
strong
enough
to
form
a
state
and
indeed
a
model
state
we
possess
all
human
and
material
resources
necessary
for
the
purpose
this
is
therefore
the
appropriate
place
to
give
an
account
of
what
has
been
somewhat
roughly
termed
our
human
material
but
it
would
not
be
appreciated
till
the
broad
lines
of
the
plan
on
which
everything
depends
has
first
been
marked
out
the
plan
the
whole
plan
is
in
its
essence
perfectly
simple
as
it
must
necessarily
be
if
it
is
to
come
within
the
comprehension
of
all
let
the
sovereignty
be
granted
us
over
a
portion
of
the
globe
large
enough
to
satisfy
the
rightful
requirements
of
a
nation
the
rest
we
shall
manage
for
ourselves
the
creation
of
a
new
state
is
neither
ridiculous
nor
impossible
we
have
in
our
day
witnessed
the
process
in
connection
with
nations
which
were
not
largely
members
of
the
middle
class
but
poorer
less
educated
and
consequently
weaker
than
ourselves
the
governments
of
all
countries
scourged
by
will
be
keenly
interested
in
assisting
us
to
obtain
the
sovereignty
we
want
the
plan
simple
in
design
but
complicated
in
execution
will
be
carried
out
by
two
agencies
the
society
of
jews
and
the
jewish
company
the
society
of
jews
will
do
the
preparatory
work
in
the
domains
of
science
and
politics
which
the
jewish
company
will
afterwards
apply
practically
the
jewish
company
will
be
the
liquidating
agent
of
the
business
interests
of
departing
jews
and
will
organize
commerce
and
trade
in
the
new
country
we
must
not
imagine
the
departure
of
the
jews
to
be
a
sudden
one
it
will
be
gradual
continuous
and
will
cover
many
decades
the
poorest
will
go
first
to
cultivate
the
soil
in
accordance
with
a
preconceived
plan
they
will
construct
roads
bridges
railways
and
telegraph
installations
regulate
rivers
and
build
their
own
dwellings
their
labor
will
create
trade
trade
will
create
markets
and
markets
will
attract
new
settlers
for
every
man
will
go
voluntarily
at
his
own
expense
and
his
own
risk
the
labor
expended
on
the
land
will
enhance
its
value
and
the
jews
will
soon
perceive
that
a
new
and
permanent
sphere
of
operation
is
opening
here
for
that
spirit
of
enterprise
which
has
heretofore
met
only
with
hatred
and
obloquy
if
we
wish
to
found
a
state
today
we
shall
not
do
it
in
the
way
which
would
have
been
the
only
possible
one
a
thousand
years
ago
it
is
foolish
to
revert
to
old
stages
of
civilization
as
many
zionists
would
like
to
do
supposing
for
example
we
were
obliged
to
clear
a
country
of
wild
beasts
we
should
not
set
about
the
task
in
the
fashion
of
europeans
of
the
fifth
century
we
should
not
take
spear
and
lance
and
go
out
singly
in
pursuit
of
bears
we
would
organize
a
large
and
active
hunting
party
drive
the
animals
together
and
throw
a
melinite
bomb
into
their
midst
if
we
wish
to
conduct
building
operations
we
shall
not
plant
a
mass
of
stakes
and
piles
on
the
shore
of
a
lake
but
we
shall
build
as
men
build
now
indeed
we
shall
build
in
a
bolder
and
more
stately
style
than
was
ever
adopted
before
for
we
now
possess
means
which
men
never
yet
possessed
the
emigrants
standing
lowest
in
the
economic
scale
will
be
slowly
followed
by
those
of
a
higher
grade
those
who
at
this
moment
are
living
in
despair
will
go
first
they
will
be
led
by
the
mediocre
intellects
which
we
produce
so
superabundantly
and
which
are
persecuted
everywhere
this
pamphlet
will
open
a
general
discussion
on
the
jewish
question
but
that
does
not
mean
that
there
will
be
any
voting
on
it
such
a
result
would
ruin
the
cause
from
the
outset
and
dissidents
must
remember
that
allegiance
or
opposition
is
entirely
voluntary
he
who
will
not
come
with
us
should
remain
behind
let
all
who
are
willing
to
join
us
fall
in
behind
our
banner
and
fight
for
our
cause
with
voice
and
pen
and
deed
those
jews
who
agree
with
our
idea
of
a
state
will
attach
themselves
to
the
society
which
will
thereby
be
authorized
to
confer
and
treat
with
governments
in
the
name
of
our
people
the
society
will
thus
be
acknowledged
in
its
relations
with
governments
as
a
power
this
acknowledgment
will
practically
create
the
state
should
the
powers
declare
themselves
willing
to
admit
our
sovereignty
over
a
neutral
piece
of
land
then
the
society
will
enter
into
negotiations
for
the
possession
of
this
land
here
two
territories
come
under
consideration
palestine
and
argentine
in
both
countries
important
experiments
in
colonization
have
been
made
though
on
the
mistaken
principle
of
a
gradual
infiltration
of
jews
an
infiltration
is
bound
to
end
badly
it
continues
till
the
inevitable
moment
when
the
native
population
feels
itself
threatened
and
forces
the
government
to
stop
a
further
influx
of
jews
immigration
is
consequently
futile
unless
we
have
the
sovereign
right
to
continue
such
immigration
the
society
of
jews
will
treat
with
the
present
masters
of
the
land
putting
itself
under
the
protectorate
of
the
european
powers
if
they
prove
friendly
to
the
plan
we
could
offer
the
present
possessors
of
the
land
enormous
advantages
assume
part
of
the
public
debt
build
new
roads
for
traffic
which
our
presence
in
the
country
would
render
necessary
and
do
many
other
things
the
creation
of
our
state
would
be
beneficial
to
adjacent
countries
because
the
cultivation
of
a
strip
of
land
increases
the
value
of
its
surrounding
districts
in
innumerable
ways
palestine
or
argentine
shall
we
choose
palestine
or
argentine
we
shall
take
what
is
given
us
and
what
is
selected
by
jewish
public
opinion
the
society
will
determine
both
these
points
argentine
is
one
of
the
most
fertile
countries
in
the
world
extends
over
a
vast
area
has
a
sparse
population
and
a
mild
climate
the
argentine
republic
would
derive
considerable
profit
from
the
cession
of
a
portion
of
its
territory
to
us
the
present
infiltration
of
jews
has
certainly
produced
some
discontent
and
it
would
be
necessary
to
enlighten
the
republic
on
the
intrinsic
difference
of
our
new
movement
palestine
is
our
historic
home
the
very
name
of
palestine
would
attract
our
people
with
a
force
of
marvellous
potency
if
his
majesty
the
sultan
were
to
give
us
palestine
we
could
in
return
undertake
to
regulate
the
whole
finances
of
turkey
we
should
there
form
a
portion
of
a
rampart
of
europe
against
asia
an
outpost
of
civilization
as
opposed
to
barbarism
we
should
as
a
neutral
state
remain
in
contact
with
all
europe
which
would
have
to
guarantee
our
existence
the
sanctuaries
of
christendom
would
be
safeguarded
by
assigning
to
them
an
status
such
as
is
to
the
law
of
nations
we
should
form
a
guard
of
honor
about
these
sanctuaries
answering
for
the
fulfilment
of
this
duty
with
our
existence
this
guard
of
honor
would
be
the
great
symbol
of
the
solution
of
the
jewish
question
after
eighteen
centuries
of
jewish
suffering
demand
medium
trade
i
said
in
the
last
chapter
the
jewish
company
will
organize
trade
and
commerce
in
the
new
country
i
shall
here
insert
a
few
remarks
on
that
point
a
scheme
such
as
mine
is
gravely
imperilled
if
it
is
opposed
by
practical
people
now
practical
people
are
as
a
rule
nothing
more
than
men
sunk
into
the
groove
of
daily
routine
unable
to
emerge
from
a
narrow
circle
of
antiquated
ideas
at
the
same
time
their
adverse
opinion
carries
great
weight
and
can
do
considerable
harm
to
a
new
project
at
any
rate
until
this
new
thing
is
sufficiently
strong
to
throw
the
practical
people
and
their
mouldy
notions
to
the
winds
in
the
earliest
period
of
european
railway
construction
some
practical
people
were
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
foolish
to
build
certain
lines
because
there
were
not
even
sufficient
passengers
to
fill
the
they
did
not
realize
the
truth
which
now
seems
obvious
to
us
that
travellers
do
not
produce
railways
but
conversely
railways
produce
travellers
the
latent
demand
of
course
is
taken
for
granted
the
impossibility
of
comprehending
how
trade
and
commerce
are
to
be
created
in
a
new
country
which
has
yet
to
be
acquired
and
cultivated
may
be
classed
with
those
doubts
of
practical
persons
concerning
the
need
of
railways
a
practical
person
would
express
himself
somewhat
in
this
fashion
granted
that
the
present
situation
of
the
jews
is
in
many
places
unendurable
and
aggravated
day
by
day
granted
that
there
exists
a
desire
to
emigrate
granted
even
that
the
jews
do
emigrate
to
the
new
country
how
will
they
earn
their
living
there
and
what
will
they
earn
what
are
they
to
live
on
when
there
the
business
of
many
people
can
not
be
artificially
organized
in
a
day
to
this
i
should
reply
we
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
organizing
trade
artificially
and
we
should
certainly
not
attempt
to
do
it
in
a
day
but
though
the
organization
of
it
may
be
impossible
the
promotion
of
it
is
not
and
how
is
commerce
to
be
encouraged
through
the
medium
of
a
demand
the
demand
recognized
the
medium
created
it
will
establish
itself
if
there
is
a
real
earnest
demand
among
jews
for
an
improvement
of
their
status
if
the
medium
to
be
created
the
jewish
company
is
sufficiently
powerful
then
commerce
will
extend
itself
freely
in
the
new
country
the
jewish
outlines
the
jewish
company
is
partly
modelled
on
the
lines
of
a
great
company
it
might
be
called
a
jewish
chartered
company
though
it
can
not
exercise
sovereign
power
and
has
other
than
purely
colonial
tasks
the
jewish
company
will
be
founded
as
a
joint
stock
company
subject
to
english
jurisdiction
framed
according
to
english
laws
and
under
the
protection
of
england
its
principal
center
will
be
london
i
can
not
tell
yet
how
large
the
company
capital
should
be
i
shall
leave
that
calculation
to
our
numerous
financiers
but
to
avoid
ambiguity
i
shall
put
it
at
a
thousand
million
marks
about
or
it
may
be
either
more
or
less
than
that
sum
the
form
of
subscription
which
will
be
further
elucidated
will
determine
what
fraction
of
the
whole
amount
must
be
paid
in
at
once
the
jewish
company
is
an
organization
with
a
transitional
character
it
is
strictly
a
business
undertaking
and
must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
the
society
of
jews
the
jewish
company
will
first
of
all
convert
into
cash
all
vested
interests
left
by
departing
jews
the
method
adopted
will
prevent
the
occurrences
of
crises
secure
every
man
property
and
facilitate
that
inner
migration
of
christian
citizens
which
has
already
been
indicated
goods
the
goods
which
come
under
consideration
are
buildings
land
and
local
business
connections
the
jewish
company
will
at
first
take
upon
itself
no
more
than
the
necessary
negotiations
for
effecting
the
sale
of
these
goods
these
jewish
sales
will
take
place
freely
and
without
any
serious
fall
in
prices
the
branch
establishments
in
various
towns
will
become
the
central
offices
for
the
sale
of
jewish
estates
and
will
charge
only
so
much
commission
on
transactions
as
will
ensure
their
financial
stability
the
development
of
this
movement
may
cause
a
considerable
fall
in
the
prices
of
landed
property
and
may
eventually
make
it
impossible
to
find
a
market
for
it
at
this
juncture
the
company
will
enter
upon
another
branch
of
its
functions
it
will
take
over
the
management
of
abandoned
estates
till
such
time
as
it
can
dispose
of
them
to
the
greatest
advantage
it
will
collect
house
rents
let
out
land
on
lease
and
install
business
managers
these
on
account
of
the
required
supervision
being
if
possible
tenants
also
the
company
will
endeavor
everywhere
to
facilitate
the
acquisition
of
land
by
its
tenants
who
are
christians
it
will
indeed
gradually
replace
its
own
officials
in
the
european
branches
by
christian
substitutes
lawyers
etc
and
these
are
not
by
any
means
to
become
servants
of
the
jews
they
are
intended
to
be
free
agents
to
the
christian
population
so
that
everything
may
be
carried
through
in
equity
fairness
and
justice
and
without
imperilling
the
internal
welfare
of
the
people
at
the
same
time
the
company
will
sell
estates
or
rather
exchange
them
for
a
house
it
will
offer
a
house
in
the
new
country
and
for
land
land
in
the
new
country
everything
being
if
possible
transferred
to
the
new
soil
in
the
same
state
as
it
was
in
the
old
and
this
transfer
will
be
a
great
and
recognized
source
of
profit
to
the
company
over
there
the
houses
offered
in
exchange
will
be
newer
more
beautiful
and
more
comfortably
fitted
and
the
landed
estates
of
greater
value
than
those
abandoned
but
they
will
cost
the
company
comparatively
little
because
it
will
have
bought
the
ground
very
cheaply
purchase
of
land
the
land
which
the
society
of
jews
will
have
secured
by
international
law
must
of
course
be
privately
acquired
provisions
made
by
individuals
for
their
own
settlement
do
not
come
within
the
province
of
this
general
account
but
the
company
will
require
large
areas
for
its
own
needs
and
ours
and
these
it
must
secure
by
centralized
purchase
it
will
negotiate
principally
for
the
acquisition
of
fiscal
domains
with
the
great
object
of
taking
possession
of
this
land
over
there
without
paying
a
price
too
high
in
the
same
way
as
it
sells
here
without
accepting
one
too
low
a
forcing
of
prices
is
not
to
be
considered
because
the
value
of
the
land
will
be
created
by
the
company
through
its
organizing
the
settlement
in
conjunction
with
the
supervising
society
of
jews
the
latter
will
see
to
it
that
the
enterprise
does
not
become
a
panama
but
a
suez
the
company
will
sell
building
sites
at
reasonable
rates
to
its
officials
and
will
allow
them
to
mortgage
these
for
the
building
of
their
homes
deducting
the
amount
due
from
their
salaries
or
putting
it
down
to
their
account
as
increased
emolument
this
will
in
addition
to
the
honors
they
expect
will
be
additional
pay
for
their
services
all
the
immense
profits
of
this
speculation
in
land
will
go
to
the
company
which
is
bound
to
receive
this
indefinite
premium
in
return
for
having
borne
the
risk
of
the
undertaking
when
the
undertaking
involves
any
risk
the
profits
must
be
freely
given
to
those
who
have
borne
it
but
under
no
other
circumstances
will
profits
be
permitted
financial
morality
consists
in
the
correlation
of
risk
and
profit
buildings
the
company
will
thus
barter
houses
and
estates
it
must
be
plain
to
any
one
who
has
observed
the
rise
in
the
value
of
land
through
its
cultivation
that
the
company
will
be
bound
to
gain
on
its
landed
property
this
can
best
be
seen
in
the
case
of
enclosed
pieces
of
land
in
town
and
country
areas
not
built
over
increase
in
value
through
surrounding
cultivation
the
men
who
carried
out
the
extension
of
paris
made
a
successful
speculation
in
land
which
was
ingenious
in
its
simplicity
instead
of
erecting
new
buildings
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
last
houses
of
the
town
they
bought
up
adjacent
pieces
of
land
and
began
to
build
on
the
outskirts
of
these
this
inverse
order
of
construction
raised
the
value
of
building
sites
with
extraordinary
rapidity
and
after
having
completed
the
outer
ring
they
built
in
the
middle
of
the
town
on
these
highly
valuable
sites
instead
of
continually
erecting
houses
at
the
extremity
will
the
company
do
its
own
building
or
employ
independent
architects
it
can
and
will
do
both
it
has
as
will
be
shown
shortly
an
immense
reserve
of
working
power
which
will
not
be
sweated
by
the
company
but
transported
into
brighter
and
happier
conditions
of
life
will
nevertheless
not
be
expensive
our
geologists
will
have
looked
to
the
provision
of
building
materials
when
they
selected
the
sites
of
the
towns
what
is
to
be
the
principle
of
construction
workmen
dwellings
the
workmen
dwellings
which
include
the
dwellings
of
all
operatives
will
be
erected
at
the
company
own
risk
and
expense
they
will
resemble
neither
those
melancholy
workmen
barracks
of
european
towns
not
those
miserable
rows
of
shanties
which
surround
factories
they
will
certainly
present
a
uniform
appearance
because
the
company
must
build
cheaply
where
it
provides
the
building
materials
to
a
great
extent
but
the
detached
houses
in
little
gardens
will
be
united
into
attractive
groups
in
each
locality
the
natural
conformation
of
the
land
will
rouse
the
ingenuity
of
our
young
architects
whose
ideas
have
not
yet
been
cramped
by
routine
and
even
if
the
people
do
not
grasp
the
whole
import
of
the
plan
they
will
at
any
rate
feel
at
ease
in
their
loose
clusters
the
temple
will
be
visible
from
long
distances
for
it
is
only
our
ancient
faith
that
has
kept
us
together
there
will
be
light
attractive
healthy
schools
for
children
conducted
on
the
most
approved
modern
systems
there
will
be
for
workmen
which
will
educate
them
in
greater
technical
knowledge
and
enable
them
to
become
intimate
with
the
working
of
machinery
there
will
be
places
of
amusement
for
the
proper
conduct
of
which
the
society
of
jews
will
be
responsible
we
are
however
speaking
merely
of
the
buildings
at
present
and
not
of
what
may
take
place
inside
of
them
i
said
that
the
company
would
build
workmen
dwellings
cheaply
and
cheaply
not
only
because
of
the
proximity
of
abundant
building
materials
not
only
because
of
the
company
proprietorship
of
the
sites
but
also
because
of
the
of
workmen
american
farmers
work
on
the
system
of
mutual
assistance
in
the
construction
of
houses
this
childishly
amicable
system
which
is
as
clumsy
as
the
erected
can
be
developed
on
much
finer
lines
unskilled
laborers
our
unskilled
laborers
who
will
come
at
first
from
the
great
reservoirs
of
russia
and
rumania
must
of
course
render
each
other
assistance
in
the
construction
of
houses
they
will
be
obliged
to
build
with
wood
in
the
beginning
because
iron
will
not
be
immediately
available
later
on
the
original
inadequate
makeshift
buildings
will
be
replaced
by
superior
dwellings
our
unskilled
laborers
will
first
mutually
erect
these
shelters
and
then
they
will
earn
their
houses
as
permanent
possessions
by
means
of
their
work
not
immediately
but
after
three
years
of
good
conduct
in
this
way
we
shall
secure
energetic
and
able
men
and
these
men
will
be
practically
trained
for
life
by
three
years
of
labor
under
good
discipline
i
said
before
that
the
company
would
not
have
to
pay
these
unskilled
laborers
what
will
they
live
on
on
the
whole
i
am
opposed
to
the
truck
system
a
but
it
will
have
to
be
applied
in
the
case
of
these
first
settlers
the
company
provides
for
them
in
so
many
ways
that
it
may
take
charge
of
their
maintenance
in
any
case
the
truck
system
will
be
enforced
only
during
the
first
few
years
and
it
will
benefit
the
workmen
by
preventing
their
being
exploited
by
small
traders
landlords
etc
the
company
will
thus
make
it
impossible
from
the
outset
for
those
of
our
people
who
are
perforce
hawkers
and
peddlers
here
to
reestablish
themselves
in
the
same
trades
over
there
and
the
company
will
also
keep
back
drunkards
and
dissolute
men
then
will
there
be
no
payment
of
wages
at
all
during
the
first
period
of
settlement
certainly
there
will
be
wages
for
overtime
the
day
the
day
is
the
regular
working
day
this
does
not
imply
that
digging
and
a
hundred
other
daily
tasks
should
only
be
performed
during
seven
hours
indeed
not
there
will
be
fourteen
hours
of
labor
work
being
done
in
shifts
of
three
and
a
half
hours
the
organization
of
all
this
will
be
military
in
character
there
will
be
commands
promotions
and
pensions
the
means
by
which
these
pensions
are
provided
being
explained
further
on
a
sound
man
can
do
a
great
deal
of
concentrated
work
in
three
and
a
half
hours
after
an
interval
of
the
same
length
of
time
which
he
will
devote
to
rest
to
his
family
and
to
his
education
under
guidance
he
will
be
quite
fresh
for
work
again
such
labor
can
do
wonders
the
day
thus
implies
fourteen
hours
of
joint
labor
more
than
that
can
not
be
put
into
a
day
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
quite
possible
to
introduce
this
day
with
success
the
attempts
to
do
so
in
belgium
and
england
are
well
known
some
advanced
political
economists
who
have
studied
the
subject
declare
that
a
day
would
suffice
the
society
of
jews
and
the
jewish
company
will
in
any
case
make
new
and
extensive
experiments
which
will
benefit
the
other
nations
of
the
world
and
if
the
day
proves
itself
practicable
it
will
be
introduced
in
our
future
state
as
the
legal
and
regular
working
day
meantime
the
company
will
always
allow
its
employees
the
day
and
it
will
always
be
in
a
position
to
do
so
the
day
will
be
the
call
to
summon
our
people
in
every
part
of
the
world
all
must
come
voluntarily
for
ours
must
indeed
be
the
promised
land
whoever
works
longer
than
seven
hours
receives
his
additional
pay
for
overtime
in
cash
seeing
that
all
his
needs
are
supplied
and
that
those
members
of
his
family
who
are
unable
to
work
are
provided
for
by
transplanted
and
centralized
philanthropic
institutions
he
can
save
a
little
money
thrift
which
is
already
a
characteristic
of
our
people
should
be
greatly
encouraged
because
it
will
in
the
first
place
facilitate
the
rise
of
individuals
to
higher
grades
and
secondly
the
money
saved
will
provide
an
immense
reserve
fund
for
future
loans
overtime
will
only
be
permitted
on
a
doctor
certificate
and
must
not
exceed
three
hours
for
our
men
will
crowd
to
work
in
the
new
country
and
the
world
will
see
then
what
an
industrious
people
we
are
i
shall
not
describe
the
mode
of
carrying
out
the
truck
system
nor
in
fact
the
innumerable
details
of
any
process
for
fear
of
confusing
my
readers
women
will
not
be
allowed
to
perform
any
arduous
labor
nor
to
work
overtime
pregnant
women
will
be
relieved
of
all
work
and
will
be
supplied
with
nourishing
food
by
the
truck
we
want
our
future
generations
to
be
strong
men
and
women
we
shall
educate
children
as
we
wish
from
the
commencement
but
this
i
shall
not
elaborate
either
my
remarks
on
workmen
dwellings
and
on
unskilled
laborers
and
their
mode
of
life
are
no
more
utopian
than
the
rest
of
my
scheme
everything
i
have
spoken
of
is
already
being
put
into
practice
only
on
an
utterly
small
scale
neither
noticed
nor
understood
the
assistance
par
le
travail
which
i
learned
to
know
and
understand
in
paris
was
of
great
service
to
me
in
the
solution
of
the
jewish
question
relief
by
labor
the
system
of
relief
by
labor
which
is
now
applied
in
paris
in
many
other
french
towns
in
england
in
switzerland
and
in
america
is
a
very
small
thing
but
capable
of
the
greatest
expansion
what
is
the
principle
of
relief
by
labor
the
principle
is
to
furnish
every
needy
man
with
easy
unskilled
work
such
as
chopping
wood
or
cutting
faggots
used
for
lighting
stoves
in
paris
households
this
is
a
kind
of
before
the
crime
done
without
loss
of
character
it
is
meant
to
prevent
men
from
taking
to
crime
out
of
want
by
providing
them
with
work
and
testing
their
willingness
to
do
it
starvation
must
never
be
allowed
to
drive
men
to
suicide
for
such
suicides
are
the
deepest
disgrace
to
a
civilization
which
allows
rich
men
to
throw
to
their
dogs
relief
by
labor
thus
provides
every
one
with
work
but
the
system
has
a
great
defect
there
is
not
a
sufficiently
large
demand
for
the
production
of
the
unskilled
workers
employed
hence
there
is
a
loss
to
those
who
employ
them
though
it
is
true
that
the
organization
is
philanthropic
and
therefore
prepared
for
loss
but
here
the
benefaction
lies
only
in
the
difference
between
the
price
paid
for
the
work
and
its
actual
value
instead
of
giving
the
beggar
two
sous
the
institution
supplies
him
with
work
on
which
it
loses
two
sous
but
at
the
same
time
it
converts
the
beggar
into
an
honest
breadwinner
who
has
earned
perhaps
franc
centimes
centimes
for
that
is
to
say
the
receiver
of
a
benefaction
in
which
there
is
nothing
humiliating
has
increased
it
fifteenfold
that
is
to
say
fifteen
thousand
millions
for
one
thousand
millions
the
institution
certainly
loses
centimes
but
the
jewish
company
will
not
lose
one
thousand
millions
it
will
draw
enormous
profits
from
this
expenditure
there
is
a
moral
side
also
the
small
system
of
relief
by
labor
which
exists
now
preserves
rectitude
through
industry
till
such
time
as
the
man
who
is
out
of
work
finds
a
post
suitable
to
his
capacities
either
in
his
old
calling
or
in
a
new
one
he
is
allowed
a
few
hours
daily
for
the
purpose
of
looking
for
a
place
in
which
task
the
institutions
assist
him
the
defect
of
these
small
organizations
so
far
has
been
that
they
have
been
prohibited
from
entering
into
competition
with
timber
merchants
etc
timber
merchants
are
electors
they
would
protest
and
would
be
justified
in
protesting
competition
with
state
has
also
been
forbidden
for
the
state
must
occupy
and
feed
its
criminals
in
fact
there
is
very
little
room
in
an
society
for
the
successful
application
of
the
system
of
assistance
par
le
travail
but
there
is
room
in
a
new
society
for
above
all
we
require
enormous
numbers
of
unskilled
laborers
to
do
the
first
rough
work
of
settlement
to
lay
down
roads
plant
trees
level
the
ground
construct
railroads
telegraph
installations
etc
all
this
will
be
carried
out
in
accordance
with
a
large
and
previously
settled
plan
commerce
the
labor
carried
to
the
new
country
will
naturally
create
trade
the
first
markets
will
supply
only
the
absolute
necessities
of
life
cattle
grain
working
clothes
tools
arms
to
mention
just
a
few
things
these
we
shall
be
obliged
at
first
to
procure
from
neighboring
states
or
from
europe
but
we
shall
make
ourselves
independent
as
soon
as
possible
the
jewish
entrepreneurs
will
soon
realize
the
business
prospects
that
the
new
country
offers
the
army
of
the
company
officials
will
gradually
introduce
more
refined
requirements
of
life
officials
include
officers
of
our
defensive
forces
who
will
always
form
about
a
tenth
part
of
our
male
colonists
they
will
be
sufficiently
numerous
to
quell
mutinies
for
the
majority
of
our
colonists
will
be
peaceably
inclined
the
refined
requirements
of
life
introduced
by
our
officials
in
good
positions
will
create
a
correspondingly
improved
market
which
will
continue
to
better
itself
the
married
man
will
send
for
wife
and
children
and
the
single
for
parents
and
relatives
as
soon
as
a
new
home
is
established
over
there
the
jews
who
emigrate
to
the
united
states
always
proceed
in
this
fashion
as
soon
as
one
of
them
has
daily
bread
and
a
roof
over
his
head
he
sends
for
his
people
for
family
ties
are
strong
among
us
the
society
of
jews
and
the
jewish
company
will
unite
in
caring
for
and
strengthening
the
family
still
more
not
only
morally
but
materially
also
the
officials
will
receive
additional
pay
on
marriage
and
on
the
birth
of
children
for
we
need
all
who
are
there
and
all
who
will
follow
other
classes
of
dwellings
i
described
before
only
workmen
dwellings
built
by
themselves
and
omitted
all
mention
of
other
classes
of
dwellings
these
i
shall
now
touch
upon
the
company
architects
will
build
for
the
poorer
classes
of
citizens
also
being
paid
in
kind
or
cash
about
a
hundred
different
types
of
houses
will
be
erected
and
of
course
repeated
these
beautiful
types
will
form
part
of
our
propaganda
the
soundness
of
their
construction
will
be
guaranteed
by
the
company
which
will
indeed
gain
nothing
by
selling
them
to
settlers
at
a
fixed
sum
and
where
will
these
houses
be
situated
that
will
be
shown
in
the
section
dealing
with
local
groups
seeing
that
the
company
does
not
wish
to
earn
anything
on
the
building
works
but
only
on
the
land
it
will
desire
as
many
architects
as
possible
to
build
by
private
contract
this
system
will
increase
the
value
of
landed
property
and
it
will
introduce
luxury
which
serves
many
purposes
luxury
encourages
arts
and
industries
paving
the
way
to
a
future
subdivision
of
large
properties
rich
jews
who
are
now
obliged
carefully
to
secrete
their
valuables
and
to
hold
their
dreary
banquets
behind
lowered
curtains
will
be
able
to
enjoy
their
possessions
in
peace
over
there
if
they
cooperate
in
carrying
out
this
emigration
scheme
their
capital
will
be
rehabilitated
and
will
have
served
to
promote
an
unexampled
undertaking
if
in
the
new
settlement
rich
jews
begin
to
rebuild
their
mansions
which
are
stared
at
in
europe
with
such
envious
eyes
it
will
soon
become
fashionable
to
live
over
there
in
beautiful
modern
houses
some
forms
of
liquidation
the
jewish
company
is
intended
to
be
the
receiver
and
administrator
of
the
goods
of
the
jews
its
methods
of
procedure
can
be
easily
imagined
in
the
case
of
houses
and
estates
but
what
methods
will
it
adopt
in
the
transfer
of
businesses
here
numberless
processes
may
be
found
practicable
which
can
not
all
be
enlarged
on
in
this
outline
but
none
of
them
will
present
any
great
difficulties
for
in
each
case
the
business
proprietor
when
he
voluntarily
decides
to
emigrate
will
settle
with
the
officers
in
his
district
on
the
most
advantageous
form
of
liquidation
this
will
most
easily
be
arranged
in
the
case
of
small
employers
in
whose
trades
the
personal
activity
of
the
proprietor
is
of
chief
importance
while
goods
and
organization
are
a
secondary
consideration
the
company
will
provide
a
certain
field
of
operation
for
the
emigrant
personal
activity
and
will
substitute
a
piece
of
ground
with
loan
of
machinery
for
his
goods
jews
are
known
to
adapt
themselves
with
remarkable
ease
to
any
form
of
earning
a
livelihood
and
they
will
quickly
learn
to
carry
on
a
new
industry
in
this
way
a
number
of
small
traders
will
become
small
landholders
the
company
will
in
fact
be
prepared
to
sustain
what
appears
to
be
a
loss
in
taking
over
the
property
of
the
poorest
emigrants
for
it
will
thereby
induce
the
free
cultivation
of
tracts
of
land
which
raises
the
value
of
adjacent
tracts
in
businesses
where
goods
and
organization
equal
or
even
exceed
in
importance
the
personal
activity
of
the
manager
whose
larger
connection
is
also
various
forms
of
liquidation
are
possible
here
comes
an
opportunity
for
that
inner
migration
of
christian
citizens
into
positions
evacuated
by
jews
the
departing
jew
will
not
lose
his
personal
business
credit
but
will
carry
it
with
him
and
make
good
use
of
it
in
a
new
country
to
establish
himself
the
jewish
company
will
open
a
current
bank
account
for
him
and
he
can
sell
the
goodwill
of
his
original
business
or
hand
it
over
to
the
control
of
managers
under
supervision
of
the
company
officials
the
managers
may
rent
the
business
or
buy
it
paying
for
it
by
instalments
but
the
company
acts
temporarily
as
curator
for
the
emigrants
in
superintending
through
its
officers
and
lawyers
the
administration
of
their
affairs
and
seeing
to
the
proper
collection
of
all
payments
if
a
jew
can
not
sell
his
business
or
entrust
it
to
a
proxy
or
wish
to
give
up
its
personal
management
he
may
stay
where
he
is
the
jews
who
stay
will
be
none
the
worse
off
for
they
will
be
relieved
of
the
competition
of
those
who
leave
and
will
no
longer
hear
the
cry
do
buy
from
jews
if
the
emigrating
business
proprietor
wishes
to
carry
on
his
old
business
in
the
new
country
he
can
make
his
arrangements
for
it
from
the
very
commencement
an
example
will
best
illustrate
my
meaning
the
firm
x
carries
on
a
large
business
in
dry
goods
the
head
of
the
firm
wishes
to
emigrate
he
begins
by
setting
up
a
branch
establishment
in
his
future
place
of
residence
and
sending
out
samples
of
his
stock
the
first
poor
settlers
will
be
his
first
customers
these
will
be
followed
by
emigrants
of
a
higher
class
who
require
superior
goods
x
then
sends
out
newer
goods
and
eventually
ships
his
newest
the
branch
establishment
begins
to
pay
while
the
principal
one
is
still
in
existence
so
that
x
ends
by
having
two
paying
he
sells
his
original
business
or
hands
it
over
to
his
christian
representative
to
manage
and
goes
off
to
take
charge
of
the
new
one
another
and
greater
example
y
and
son
are
large
with
mines
and
factories
of
their
own
how
is
so
huge
and
complex
a
property
to
be
liquidated
the
mines
and
everything
connected
with
them
might
in
the
first
place
be
bought
up
by
the
state
in
which
they
are
situated
in
the
second
place
the
jewish
company
might
take
them
over
paying
for
them
partly
in
land
partly
in
cash
a
third
method
might
be
the
conversion
of
y
and
son
into
a
limited
company
a
fourth
method
might
be
the
continued
working
of
the
business
under
the
original
proprietors
who
would
return
at
intervals
to
inspect
their
property
as
foreigners
and
as
such
under
the
protection
of
law
in
every
civilized
state
all
these
suggestions
are
carried
out
daily
a
fifth
and
excellent
method
and
one
which
might
be
particularly
profitable
i
shall
merely
indicate
because
the
existing
examples
of
its
working
are
at
present
few
however
ready
the
modern
consciousness
may
be
to
adopt
them
y
and
son
might
sell
their
enterprise
to
the
collective
body
of
their
employees
who
would
form
a
cooperative
society
with
limited
liability
and
might
perhaps
pay
the
requisite
sum
with
the
help
of
the
state
treasury
which
does
not
charge
high
interest
the
employees
would
then
gradually
pay
off
the
loan
which
either
the
government
or
the
jewish
company
or
even
y
and
son
would
have
advanced
to
them
the
jewish
company
will
be
prepared
to
conduct
the
transfer
of
the
smallest
affairs
equally
with
the
largest
and
whilst
the
jews
quietly
emigrate
and
establish
their
new
homes
the
company
acts
as
the
great
controlling
body
which
organizes
the
departure
takes
charge
of
deserted
possessions
guarantees
the
proper
conduct
of
the
movement
with
its
own
visible
and
tangible
property
and
provides
permanent
security
for
those
who
have
already
settled
securities
of
the
company
what
assurance
will
the
company
offer
that
the
abandonment
of
countries
will
not
cause
their
impoverishment
and
produce
economic
crises
i
have
already
mentioned
that
honest
whilst
preserving
their
independence
will
combine
with
our
officials
in
controlling
the
transfer
of
our
estates
but
the
state
revenues
might
suffer
by
the
loss
of
a
body
of
taxpayers
who
though
little
appreciated
as
citizens
are
highly
valued
in
finance
the
state
should
therefore
receive
compensation
for
this
loss
this
we
offer
indirectly
by
leaving
in
the
country
businesses
which
we
have
built
up
by
means
of
jewish
acumen
and
jewish
industry
by
letting
our
christian
move
into
our
evacuated
positions
and
by
this
facilitating
the
rise
of
numbers
of
people
to
greater
prosperity
so
peaceably
and
in
so
unparallelled
a
manner
the
french
revolution
had
a
somewhat
similar
result
on
a
small
scale
but
it
was
brought
about
by
bloodshed
on
the
guillotine
in
every
province
of
france
and
on
the
battlefields
of
europe
moreover
inherited
and
acquired
rights
were
destroyed
and
only
cunning
buyers
enriched
themselves
by
the
purchase
of
state
properties
the
jewish
company
will
offer
to
the
states
that
come
within
its
sphere
of
activity
direct
as
well
as
indirect
advantages
it
will
give
governments
the
first
offer
of
abandoned
jewish
property
and
allow
buyers
most
favorable
conditions
governments
again
will
be
able
to
make
use
of
this
friendly
appropriation
of
land
for
the
purpose
of
certain
social
improvements
the
jewish
company
will
give
every
assistance
to
governments
and
parliaments
in
their
efforts
to
direct
the
inner
migration
of
christian
citizens
the
jewish
company
will
also
pay
heavy
taxes
its
central
office
will
be
in
london
so
as
to
be
under
the
legal
protection
of
a
power
which
is
not
at
present
but
the
company
if
it
is
supported
officially
and
will
everywhere
provide
a
broad
basis
of
taxation
to
this
end
it
will
establish
taxable
branch
offices
everywhere
further
it
will
pay
double
duties
on
the
transfer
of
goods
which
it
accomplishes
even
in
transactions
where
the
company
is
really
nothing
more
than
a
real
estate
agency
it
will
temporarily
appear
as
a
purchaser
and
will
be
set
down
as
the
momentary
possessor
in
the
register
of
landed
property
these
are
of
course
purely
calculable
matters
it
will
have
to
be
considered
and
decided
in
each
place
how
far
the
company
can
go
without
running
any
risks
of
failure
and
the
company
itself
will
confer
freely
with
finance
ministers
on
the
various
points
at
issue
ministers
will
recognize
the
friendly
spirit
of
our
enterprise
and
will
consequently
offer
every
facility
in
their
power
necessary
for
the
successful
achievement
of
the
great
undertaking
further
and
direct
profit
will
accrue
to
governments
from
the
transport
of
passengers
and
goods
and
where
railways
are
state
property
the
returns
will
be
immediately
recognizable
where
they
are
held
by
private
companies
the
jewish
company
will
receive
favorable
terms
for
transport
in
the
same
way
as
does
every
transmitter
of
goods
on
a
large
scale
freight
and
carriage
must
be
made
as
cheap
as
possible
for
our
people
because
every
traveller
will
pay
his
own
expenses
the
middle
classes
will
travel
with
cook
tickets
the
poorer
classes
in
emigrant
trains
the
company
might
make
a
good
deal
by
reductions
on
passengers
and
goods
but
here
as
elsewhere
it
must
adhere
to
its
principle
of
not
trying
to
raise
its
receipts
to
a
greater
sum
than
will
cover
its
working
expenses
in
many
places
jews
have
control
of
the
transport
and
the
transport
businesses
will
be
the
first
needed
by
the
company
and
the
first
to
be
liquidated
by
it
the
original
owners
of
these
concerns
will
either
enter
the
company
service
or
establish
themselves
independently
over
there
the
new
arrivals
will
certainly
require
their
assistance
and
theirs
being
a
paying
profession
which
they
may
and
indeed
must
exercise
there
to
earn
a
living
numbers
of
these
enterprising
spirits
will
depart
it
is
unnecessary
to
describe
all
the
business
details
of
this
monster
expedition
they
must
be
judiciously
evolved
out
of
the
original
plan
by
many
able
men
who
must
apply
their
minds
to
achieving
the
best
system
some
of
the
company
activities
many
activities
will
be
interconnected
for
example
the
company
will
gradually
introduce
the
manufacture
of
goods
into
the
settlements
which
will
of
course
be
extremely
primitive
at
their
inception
clothing
linens
and
shoes
will
first
of
all
be
manufactured
for
our
own
poor
emigrants
who
will
be
provided
with
new
suits
of
clothing
at
the
various
european
emigration
centers
they
will
not
receive
these
clothes
as
alms
which
might
hurt
their
pride
but
in
exchange
for
old
garments
any
loss
the
company
sustains
by
this
transaction
will
be
booked
as
a
business
loss
those
who
are
absolutely
without
means
will
pay
off
their
debt
to
the
company
by
working
overtime
at
a
fair
rate
of
wage
existing
emigration
societies
will
be
able
to
give
valuable
assistance
here
for
they
will
do
for
the
company
colonists
what
they
did
before
for
departing
jews
the
forms
of
such
cooperation
will
easily
be
found
even
the
new
clothing
of
the
poor
settlers
will
have
the
symbolic
meaning
you
are
now
entering
on
a
new
life
the
society
of
jews
will
see
to
it
that
long
before
the
departure
and
also
during
the
journey
a
serious
yet
festive
spirit
is
fostered
by
means
of
prayers
popular
lectures
instruction
on
the
object
of
the
expedition
instruction
on
hygienic
matters
for
their
new
places
of
residence
and
guidance
in
regard
to
their
future
work
for
the
promised
land
is
the
land
of
work
on
their
arrival
the
emigrants
will
be
welcomed
by
our
chief
officials
with
due
solemnity
but
without
foolish
exultation
for
the
promised
land
will
not
yet
have
been
conquered
but
these
poor
people
should
already
see
that
they
are
at
home
the
clothing
industries
of
the
company
will
of
course
not
produce
their
goods
without
proper
organization
the
society
of
jews
will
obtain
from
the
local
branches
information
about
the
number
requirements
and
date
of
arrival
of
the
settlers
and
will
communicate
all
such
information
in
good
time
to
the
jewish
company
in
this
way
it
will
be
possible
to
provide
for
them
with
every
precaution
promotion
of
industries
the
duties
of
the
jewish
company
and
the
society
of
jews
can
not
be
kept
strictly
apart
in
this
outline
these
two
great
bodies
will
have
to
work
constantly
in
unison
the
company
depending
on
the
moral
authority
and
support
of
the
society
just
as
the
society
can
not
dispense
with
the
material
assistance
of
the
company
for
example
in
the
organizing
of
the
clothing
industry
the
quantity
produced
will
at
first
be
kept
down
so
as
to
preserve
an
equilibrium
between
supply
and
demand
and
wherever
the
company
undertakes
the
organization
of
new
industries
the
same
precaution
must
be
exercised
but
individual
enterprise
must
never
be
checked
by
the
company
with
its
superior
force
we
shall
only
work
collectively
when
the
immense
difficulties
of
the
task
demand
common
action
we
shall
wherever
possible
scrupulously
respect
the
rights
of
the
individual
private
property
which
is
the
economic
basis
of
independence
shall
be
developed
freely
and
be
respected
by
us
our
first
unskilled
laborers
will
at
once
have
the
opportunity
to
work
their
way
up
to
private
proprietorship
the
spirit
of
enterprise
must
indeed
be
encouraged
in
every
possible
way
organization
of
industries
will
be
promoted
by
a
judicious
system
of
duties
by
the
employment
of
cheap
raw
material
and
by
the
institution
of
a
board
to
collect
and
publish
industrial
statistics
but
this
spirit
of
enterprise
must
be
wisely
encouraged
and
risky
speculation
must
be
avoided
every
new
industry
must
be
advertised
for
a
long
period
before
establishment
so
as
to
prevent
failure
on
the
part
of
those
who
might
wish
to
start
a
similar
business
six
months
later
whenever
a
new
industrial
establishment
is
founded
the
company
should
be
informed
so
that
all
those
interested
may
obtain
information
from
it
industrialists
will
be
able
to
make
use
of
centralized
labor
agencies
which
will
only
receive
a
commission
large
enough
to
ensure
their
continuance
the
industrialists
might
for
example
telegraph
for
unskilled
laborers
for
three
days
three
weeks
or
three
months
the
labor
agency
would
then
collect
these
unskilled
laborers
from
every
possible
source
and
despatch
them
at
once
to
carry
out
the
agricultural
or
industrial
enterprise
parties
of
workmen
will
thus
be
systematically
drafted
from
place
to
place
like
a
body
of
troops
these
men
will
of
course
not
be
sweated
but
will
work
only
a
day
and
in
spite
of
their
change
of
locality
they
will
preserve
their
organization
work
out
their
term
of
service
and
receive
commands
promotions
and
pensions
some
establishments
may
of
course
be
able
to
obtain
their
workmen
from
other
sources
if
they
wish
but
they
will
not
find
it
easy
to
do
so
the
society
will
be
able
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
by
boycotting
obstinate
employers
by
obstructing
traffic
and
by
various
other
methods
the
workers
will
therefore
have
to
be
taken
and
we
shall
thus
bring
our
people
gradually
and
without
coercion
to
adopt
the
normal
day
settlement
of
skilled
laborers
it
is
clear
that
what
can
be
done
for
unskilled
workers
can
be
even
more
easily
done
for
skilled
laborers
these
will
work
under
similar
regulations
in
the
factories
and
the
central
labor
agency
will
provide
them
when
required
independent
operatives
and
small
employers
must
be
carefully
taught
on
account
of
the
rapid
progress
of
scientific
improvements
must
acquire
technical
knowledge
even
if
no
longer
very
young
men
must
study
the
power
of
water
and
appreciate
the
forces
of
electricity
independent
workers
must
also
be
discovered
and
supplied
by
the
society
agency
the
local
branch
will
apply
for
example
to
the
central
office
we
want
so
many
carpenters
locksmiths
glaziers
etc
the
central
office
will
publish
this
demand
and
the
proper
men
will
apply
there
for
the
work
these
would
then
travel
with
their
families
to
the
place
where
they
were
wanted
and
would
remain
there
without
feeling
the
pressure
of
undue
competition
a
permanent
and
comfortable
home
would
thus
be
provided
for
them
method
of
raising
capital
the
capital
required
for
establishing
the
company
was
previously
put
at
what
seemed
an
absurdly
high
figure
the
amount
actually
necessary
will
be
fixed
by
financiers
and
will
in
any
case
be
a
very
considerable
sum
there
are
three
ways
of
raising
this
sum
all
of
which
the
society
will
take
under
consideration
this
society
the
great
gestor
of
the
jews
will
be
formed
by
our
best
and
most
upright
men
who
must
not
derive
any
material
advantage
from
their
membership
although
the
society
can
not
at
the
outset
possess
any
but
moral
authority
this
authority
will
suffice
to
establish
the
credit
of
the
jewish
company
in
the
nation
eyes
the
jewish
company
will
be
unable
to
succeed
in
its
enterprise
unless
it
has
received
the
society
sanction
it
will
thus
not
be
formed
of
any
mere
indiscriminate
group
of
financiers
for
the
society
will
weigh
select
and
decide
and
will
not
give
its
approbation
till
it
is
sure
of
the
existence
of
a
sound
basis
for
the
conscientious
carrying
out
of
the
scheme
it
will
not
permit
experiments
with
insufficient
means
for
this
undertaking
must
succeed
at
the
first
attempt
any
initial
failure
would
compromise
the
whole
idea
for
many
decades
to
come
or
might
even
make
its
realization
permanently
impossible
the
three
methods
of
raising
capital
are
through
big
banks
through
small
and
private
banks
through
public
subscription
the
first
method
of
raising
capital
is
through
big
banks
the
required
sum
could
then
be
raised
in
the
shortest
possible
time
among
the
large
financial
groups
after
they
had
discussed
the
advisability
of
the
course
the
great
advantage
of
this
method
would
be
that
it
would
avoid
the
necessity
of
paying
in
the
thousand
millions
to
keep
to
the
original
figure
immediately
in
its
entirety
a
further
advantage
would
be
that
the
credit
of
these
powerful
financiers
would
also
be
of
service
to
the
enterprise
many
latent
political
forces
lie
in
our
financial
power
that
power
which
our
enemies
assert
to
be
so
effective
it
might
be
so
but
actually
it
is
not
poor
jews
feel
only
the
hatred
which
this
financial
power
provokes
its
use
in
alleviating
their
lot
as
a
body
they
have
not
yet
felt
the
credit
of
our
great
jewish
financiers
would
have
to
be
placed
at
the
service
of
the
national
idea
but
should
these
gentlemen
who
are
quite
satisfied
with
their
lot
feel
indisposed
to
do
anything
for
their
who
are
unjustly
held
responsible
for
the
large
possessions
of
certain
individuals
then
the
realization
of
this
plan
will
afford
an
opportunity
for
drawing
a
clear
line
of
distinction
between
them
and
the
rest
of
jewry
the
great
financiers
moreover
will
certainly
not
be
asked
to
raise
an
amount
so
enormous
out
of
pure
philanthropic
motives
that
would
be
expecting
too
much
the
promoters
and
stock
holders
of
the
jewish
company
are
on
the
contrary
expected
to
do
a
good
piece
of
business
and
they
will
be
able
to
calculate
beforehand
what
their
chances
of
success
are
likely
to
be
for
the
society
of
jews
will
be
in
possession
of
all
documents
and
references
which
may
serve
to
define
the
prospects
of
the
jewish
company
the
society
will
in
particular
have
investigated
with
exactitude
the
extent
of
the
new
jewish
movement
so
as
to
provide
the
company
promoters
with
thoroughly
reliable
information
on
the
amount
of
support
they
may
expect
the
society
will
also
supply
the
jewish
company
with
comprehensive
modern
jewish
statistics
thus
doing
the
work
of
what
is
called
in
france
a
societ√©
which
undertakes
all
preliminary
research
previous
to
the
financing
of
a
great
undertaking
even
so
the
enterprise
may
not
receive
the
valuable
assistance
of
our
moneyed
magnates
these
might
perhaps
even
try
to
oppose
the
jewish
movement
by
means
of
their
secret
agents
such
opposition
we
shall
meet
with
relentless
determination
supposing
that
these
magnates
are
content
simply
to
turn
this
scheme
down
with
a
smile
is
it
therefore
done
for
no
for
then
the
money
will
be
raised
in
another
way
by
an
appeal
to
moderately
rich
jews
the
smaller
jewish
banks
would
have
to
be
united
in
the
name
of
the
national
idea
against
the
big
banks
till
they
were
gathered
into
a
second
and
formidable
financial
force
but
unfortunately
this
would
require
a
great
deal
of
financing
at
first
for
the
would
have
to
be
subscribed
in
full
before
starting
work
and
as
this
sum
could
only
be
raised
very
slowly
all
sorts
of
banking
business
would
have
to
be
done
and
loans
made
during
the
first
few
years
it
might
even
occur
that
in
the
course
of
all
these
transactions
their
original
object
would
be
forgotten
the
moderately
rich
jews
would
have
created
a
new
and
large
business
and
jewish
emigration
would
be
forgotten
the
notion
of
raising
money
in
this
way
is
not
by
any
means
impracticable
the
experiment
of
collecting
christian
money
to
form
an
opposing
force
to
the
big
banks
has
already
been
tried
that
one
could
also
oppose
them
with
jewish
money
has
not
been
thought
of
until
now
but
these
financial
conflicts
would
bring
about
all
sorts
of
crises
the
countries
in
which
they
occurred
would
suffer
and
would
become
rampant
this
method
is
therefore
not
to
be
recommended
i
have
merely
suggested
it
because
it
comes
up
in
the
course
of
the
logical
development
of
the
idea
i
also
do
not
know
whether
smaller
private
banks
would
be
willing
to
adopt
it
in
any
case
even
the
refusal
of
moderately
rich
jews
would
not
put
an
end
to
the
scheme
on
the
contrary
it
would
then
have
to
be
taken
up
in
real
earnest
the
society
of
jews
whose
members
are
not
business
men
might
try
to
found
the
company
on
a
national
subscription
the
company
capital
might
be
raised
without
the
intermediary
of
a
syndicate
by
means
of
direct
subscription
on
the
part
of
the
public
not
only
poor
jews
but
also
christians
who
wanted
to
get
rid
of
them
would
subscribe
a
small
amount
to
this
fund
a
new
and
peculiar
form
of
the
plebiscite
would
thus
be
established
whereby
each
man
who
voted
for
this
solution
of
the
jewish
question
would
express
his
opinion
by
subscribing
a
stipulated
amount
this
stipulation
would
produce
security
the
funds
subscribed
would
only
be
paid
in
if
their
sum
total
reached
the
required
amount
otherwise
the
initial
payments
would
be
returned
but
if
the
whole
of
the
required
sum
is
raised
by
popular
subscription
then
each
little
amount
would
be
secured
by
the
great
numbers
of
other
small
amounts
all
this
would
of
course
need
the
express
and
definite
assistance
of
interested
governments
footnotes

practice

paying
the
workman
wages
in
goods

money
local
our
transmigration
previous
chapters
explained
only
how
the
emigration
scheme
might
be
carried
out
without
creating
any
economic
disturbance
but
so
great
a
movement
can
not
take
place
without
inevitably
rousing
many
deep
and
powerful
feelings
there
are
old
customs
old
memories
that
attach
us
to
our
homes
we
have
cradles
we
have
graves
and
we
alone
know
how
jewish
hearts
cling
to
the
graves
our
cradles
we
shall
carry
with
us
they
hold
our
future
rosy
and
smiling
our
beloved
graves
we
must
abandon
and
i
think
this
abandonment
will
cost
us
more
than
any
other
sacrifice
but
it
must
be
so
economic
distress
political
pressure
and
social
obloquy
have
already
driven
us
from
our
homes
and
from
our
graves
we
jews
are
even
now
constantly
shifting
from
place
to
place
a
strong
current
actually
carrying
us
westward
over
the
sea
to
the
united
states
where
our
presence
is
also
not
desired
and
where
will
our
presence
be
desired
so
long
as
we
are
a
homeless
nation
but
we
shall
give
a
home
to
our
people
and
we
shall
give
it
not
by
dragging
them
ruthlessly
out
of
their
sustaining
soil
but
rather
by
transplanting
them
carefully
to
a
better
ground
just
as
we
wish
to
create
new
political
and
economic
relations
so
we
shall
preserve
as
sacred
all
of
the
past
that
is
dear
to
our
people
hearts
hence
a
few
suggestions
must
suffice
as
this
part
of
my
scheme
will
most
probably
be
condemned
as
visionary
yet
even
this
is
possible
and
real
though
it
now
appears
to
be
something
vague
and
aimless
organization
will
make
of
it
something
rational
emigration
in
groups
our
people
should
emigrate
in
groups
of
families
and
friends
but
no
man
will
be
forced
to
join
the
particular
group
belonging
to
his
former
place
of
residence
each
will
be
able
to
journey
in
his
chosen
fashion
as
soon
as
he
has
settled
his
affairs
seeing
that
each
man
will
pay
his
own
expenses
by
rail
and
boat
he
will
naturally
travel
by
whatever
class
suits
him
best
possibly
there
will
even
be
no
subdivision
for
classes
on
board
train
and
boat
so
as
to
avoid
making
the
poor
feel
their
position
too
keenly
during
their
long
journey
though
we
are
not
exactly
organizing
a
pleasure
trip
it
is
as
well
to
keep
them
in
good
humor
on
the
way
none
will
travel
in
penury
on
the
other
hand
all
who
desire
to
travel
in
luxurious
ease
will
be
able
to
follow
their
bent
even
under
favorable
circumstances
the
movement
may
not
touch
certain
classes
of
jews
for
several
years
to
come
the
intervening
period
can
therefore
be
employed
in
selecting
the
best
modes
of
organizing
the
journeys
those
who
are
well
off
can
travel
in
parties
if
they
wish
taking
their
personal
friends
and
connections
with
them
jews
with
the
exception
of
the
richest
have
after
all
very
little
intercourse
with
christians
in
some
countries
their
acquaintance
with
them
is
confined
to
a
few
spongers
borrowers
and
dependents
of
a
better
class
of
christian
they
know
nothing
the
ghetto
continues
though
its
walls
are
broken
down
the
middle
classes
will
therefore
make
elaborate
and
careful
preparations
for
departure
a
group
of
travellers
will
be
formed
in
each
locality
large
towns
being
divided
into
districts
with
a
group
in
each
district
who
will
communicate
by
means
of
representatives
elected
for
the
purpose
this
division
into
districts
need
not
be
strictly
adhered
to
it
is
merely
intended
to
alleviate
the
discomfort
and
of
the
poor
during
their
journey
outwards
everybody
is
free
to
travel
either
alone
or
attached
to
any
local
group
he
prefers
the
conditions
of
travel
regulated
according
to
classes
will
apply
to
all
alike
any
sufficiently
numerous
travelling
party
can
charter
a
special
train
and
special
boat
from
the
company
the
company
housing
agency
will
provide
quarters
for
the
poorest
on
their
arrival
later
on
when
more
prosperous
emigrants
follow
their
obvious
need
for
lodgings
on
first
landing
will
have
to
be
supplied
by
hotels
built
by
private
enterprise
some
of
these
more
prosperous
colonists
will
indeed
have
built
their
houses
before
becoming
permanent
settlers
so
that
they
will
merely
move
from
an
old
home
into
a
new
one
it
would
be
an
affront
to
our
intelligent
elements
to
point
out
everything
that
they
have
to
do
every
man
who
attaches
himself
to
the
national
idea
will
know
how
to
spread
it
and
how
to
make
it
real
within
his
sphere
of
influence
we
shall
first
of
all
ask
for
the
cooperation
of
our
rabbis
our
rabbis
every
group
will
have
its
rabbi
travelling
with
his
congregation
local
groups
will
afterwards
form
voluntarily
about
their
rabbi
and
each
locality
will
have
its
spiritual
leader
our
rabbis
on
whom
we
especially
call
will
devote
their
energies
to
the
service
of
our
idea
and
will
inspire
their
congregations
by
preaching
it
from
the
pulpit
they
will
not
need
to
address
special
meetings
for
the
purpose
an
appeal
such
as
this
may
be
uttered
in
the
synagogue
and
thus
it
must
be
done
for
we
feel
our
historic
affinity
only
through
the
faith
of
our
fathers
as
we
have
long
ago
absorbed
the
languages
of
different
nations
to
an
ineradicable
degree
the
rabbis
will
receive
communications
regularly
from
both
society
and
company
and
will
announce
and
explain
these
to
their
congregations
israel
will
pray
for
us
and
for
itself
representatives
of
the
local
groups
the
local
groups
will
appoint
small
committees
of
representative
men
under
the
rabbi
presidency
for
discussion
and
settlement
of
local
affairs
philanthropic
institutions
will
be
transferred
by
their
local
groups
each
institution
remaining
over
there
the
property
of
the
same
set
of
people
for
whom
it
was
originally
founded
i
think
the
old
buildings
should
not
be
sold
but
rather
devoted
to
the
assistance
of
indigent
christians
in
the
forsaken
towns
the
local
groups
will
receive
compensation
by
obtaining
free
building
sites
and
every
facility
for
reconstruction
in
the
new
country
this
transfer
of
philanthropic
institutions
will
give
another
of
those
opportunities
which
occur
at
different
points
of
my
scheme
for
making
an
experiment
in
the
service
of
humanity
our
present
unsystematic
private
philanthropy
does
little
good
in
proportion
to
the
great
expenditure
it
involves
but
these
institutions
can
and
must
form
part
of
a
system
by
which
they
will
eventually
supplement
one
another
in
a
new
society
these
organizations
can
be
evolved
out
of
our
modern
consciousness
and
may
be
based
on
all
previous
social
experiments
this
matter
is
of
great
importance
to
us
on
account
of
our
large
number
of
paupers
the
weaker
characters
among
us
discouraged
by
external
pressure
spoilt
by
the
charity
of
our
rich
men
easily
sink
until
they
take
to
begging
the
society
supported
by
the
local
groups
will
give
greatest
attention
to
popular
education
with
regard
to
this
particular
it
will
create
a
fruitful
soil
for
many
powers
which
now
wither
uselessly
away
whoever
shows
a
genuine
desire
to
work
will
be
suitably
employed
beggars
will
not
be
endured
whoever
refuses
to
do
anything
as
a
free
man
will
be
sent
to
the
workhouse
on
the
other
hand
we
shall
not
relegate
the
old
to
an
almshouse
an
almshouse
is
one
of
the
cruelest
charities
which
our
stupid
good
nature
ever
invented
there
our
old
people
die
out
of
pure
shame
and
mortification
there
they
are
already
buried
but
we
will
leave
even
to
those
who
stand
on
the
lowest
grade
of
intelligence
the
consoling
illusion
of
their
utility
in
the
world
we
will
provide
easy
tasks
for
those
who
are
incapable
of
physical
labor
for
we
must
allow
for
diminished
vitality
in
the
poor
of
an
already
enfeebled
generation
but
future
generations
shall
be
dealt
with
otherwise
they
shall
be
brought
up
in
liberty
for
a
life
of
liberty
we
will
seek
to
bestow
the
moral
salvation
of
work
on
men
of
every
age
and
of
every
class
and
thus
our
people
will
find
their
strength
again
in
the
land
of
the
day
plans
of
the
towns
the
local
groups
will
delegate
their
authorized
representatives
to
select
sites
for
towns
in
the
distribution
of
land
every
precaution
will
be
taken
to
effect
a
careful
transfer
with
due
consideration
for
acquired
rights
the
local
groups
will
have
plans
of
the
towns
so
that
our
people
may
know
beforehand
where
they
are
to
go
in
which
towns
and
in
which
houses
they
are
to
live
comprehensive
drafts
of
the
building
plans
previously
referred
to
will
be
distributed
among
the
local
groups
the
principle
of
our
administration
will
be
strict
centralization
of
our
local
groups
autonomy
in
this
way
the
transfer
will
be
accomplished
with
the
minimum
of
pain
i
do
not
imagine
all
this
to
be
easier
than
it
actually
is
on
the
other
hand
people
must
not
imagine
it
to
be
more
difficult
than
it
is
in
reality
the
departure
of
the
middle
classes
the
middle
classes
will
involuntarily
be
drawn
into
the
outgoing
current
for
their
sons
will
be
officials
of
the
society
or
employees
of
the
company
over
there
lawyers
doctors
technicians
of
every
description
young
business
people
in
fact
all
jews
who
are
in
search
of
opportunities
who
now
escape
from
oppression
in
their
native
country
to
earn
a
living
in
foreign
lands
will
assemble
on
a
soil
so
full
of
fair
promise
the
daughters
of
the
middle
classes
will
marry
these
ambitious
men
one
of
them
will
send
for
his
wife
or
fiancee
to
come
out
to
him
another
for
his
parents
brothers
and
sisters
members
of
a
new
civilization
marry
young
this
will
promote
general
morality
and
ensure
sturdiness
in
the
new
generation
and
thus
we
shall
have
no
delicate
offspring
of
late
marriages
children
of
fathers
who
spent
their
strength
in
the
struggle
for
life
every
emigrant
will
draw
more
of
his
kind
after
him
the
bravest
will
naturally
get
the
best
out
of
the
new
world
but
there
we
seem
undoubtedly
to
have
touched
on
the
crucial
difficulty
of
my
plan
even
if
we
succeeded
in
opening
a
world
discussion
on
the
jewish
question
in
a
serious
manner
even
if
this
debate
led
us
to
a
positive
conclusion
that
the
jewish
state
were
necessary
to
the
world
even
if
the
powers
assisted
us
in
acquiring
the
sovereignty
over
a
strip
of
territory
how
are
we
to
transport
masses
of
jews
without
undue
compulsion
from
their
present
homes
to
this
new
country
their
emigration
is
surely
intended
to
be
voluntary
the
phenomenon
of
multitudes
great
exertions
will
hardly
be
necessary
to
spur
on
the
movement
provide
the
requisite
impetus
they
need
only
do
what
they
did
before
and
then
they
will
create
a
desire
to
emigrate
where
it
did
not
previously
exist
and
strengthen
it
where
it
existed
before
jews
who
now
remain
in
countries
do
so
chiefly
because
even
those
among
them
who
are
most
ignorant
of
history
know
that
numerous
changes
of
residence
in
bygone
centuries
never
brought
them
any
permanent
good
any
land
which
welcomed
the
jews
today
and
offered
them
even
fewer
advantages
than
that
which
the
jewish
state
would
guarantee
them
would
immediately
attract
a
great
influx
of
our
people
the
poorest
who
have
nothing
to
lose
would
drag
themselves
there
but
i
maintain
and
every
man
may
ask
himself
whether
i
am
not
right
that
the
pressure
weighing
on
us
arouses
a
desire
to
emigrate
even
among
prosperous
strata
of
society
now
our
poorest
strata
alone
would
suffice
to
found
a
state
these
form
the
strongest
human
material
for
acquiring
a
land
because
a
little
despair
is
indispensable
to
the
formation
of
a
great
undertaking
but
when
our
desperados
increase
the
value
of
the
land
by
their
presence
and
by
the
labor
they
expend
on
it
they
make
it
at
the
same
time
increasingly
attractive
as
a
place
of
settlement
to
people
who
are
better
off
higher
and
yet
higher
strata
will
feel
tempted
to
go
over
the
expedition
of
the
first
and
poorest
settlers
will
be
conducted
by
company
and
society
conjointly
and
will
probably
be
additionally
supported
by
existing
emigration
and
zionist
societies
how
may
a
number
of
people
be
directed
to
a
particular
spot
without
being
given
express
orders
to
go
there
there
are
certain
jewish
benefactors
on
a
large
scale
who
try
to
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
the
jews
by
zionist
experiments
to
them
this
problem
also
presented
itself
and
they
thought
to
solve
it
by
giving
the
emigrants
money
or
means
of
employment
thus
the
philanthropists
said
we
pay
these
people
to
go
there
such
a
procedure
is
utterly
wrong
and
all
the
money
in
the
world
will
not
achieve
its
purpose
on
the
other
hand
the
company
will
say
we
shall
not
pay
them
we
shall
let
them
pay
us
we
shall
merely
offer
them
some
inducements
to
go
a
fanciful
illustration
will
make
my
meaning
more
explicit
one
of
those
philanthropists
whom
we
will
call
the
baron
and
myself
both
wish
to
get
a
crowd
of
people
on
to
the
plain
of
longchamps
near
paris
on
a
hot
sunday
afternoon
the
baron
by
promising
them
francs
each
will
for
francs
bring
out
perspiring
and
miserable
people
who
will
curse
him
for
having
given
them
so
much
annoyance
whereas
i
will
offer
these
francs
as
a
prize
for
the
swiftest
racehorse
and
then
i
shall
have
to
put
up
barriers
to
keep
the
people
off
longchamps
they
will
pay
to
go
in
franc
francs
francs
the
consequence
will
be
that
i
shall
get
the
of
people
out
there
the
president
of
the
republic
will
drive
up
a
la
daumont
and
the
crowds
will
enjoy
and
amuse
themselves
most
of
them
will
think
it
an
agreeable
walk
in
the
open
air
in
spite
of
heat
and
dust
and
i
shall
have
made
by
my
francs
about
a
million
in
entrance
money
and
taxes
on
gaming
i
shall
get
the
same
people
out
there
whenever
i
like
but
the
baron
will
not
not
on
any
account
i
will
give
a
more
serious
illustration
of
the
phenomenon
of
multitudes
where
they
are
earning
a
livelihood
let
any
man
attempt
to
cry
through
the
streets
of
a
town
whoever
is
willing
to
stand
all
day
long
through
a
winter
terrible
cold
through
a
tormenting
heat
in
an
iron
hall
exposed
on
all
sides
there
to
address
every
and
to
offer
him
fancy
wares
or
fish
or
fruit
will
receive
two
florins
or
four
francs
or
something
similar
how
many
people
would
go
to
the
hall
how
many
days
would
they
hold
out
when
hunger
drove
them
there
and
if
they
held
out
what
energy
would
they
display
in
trying
to
persuade
to
buy
fish
fruit
and
fancy
wares
we
shall
set
about
it
in
a
different
way
in
places
where
trade
is
active
and
these
places
we
shall
the
more
easily
discover
since
we
ourselves
direct
trade
withersoever
we
wish
in
these
places
we
shall
build
large
halls
and
call
them
markets
these
halls
might
be
worse
built
and
more
unwholesome
than
those
above
mentioned
and
yet
people
would
stream
towards
them
but
we
shall
use
our
best
efforts
and
we
shall
build
them
better
and
make
them
more
beautiful
than
the
first
and
the
people
to
whom
we
had
promised
nothing
because
we
can
not
promise
anything
without
deceiving
them
these
excellent
keen
business
men
will
gaily
create
most
active
commercial
intercourse
they
will
harangue
the
buyers
unweariedly
they
will
stand
on
their
feet
and
scarcely
think
of
fatigue
they
will
hurry
off
at
dawn
so
as
to
be
first
on
the
spot
they
will
form
unions
cartels
anything
to
continue
undisturbed
and
if
they
find
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
all
their
hard
work
has
produced
only
florin
kreutzer
or
francs
or
something
similar
they
will
yet
look
forward
hopefully
to
the
next
day
which
may
perhaps
bring
them
better
luck
we
have
given
them
hope
would
any
one
ask
whence
the
demand
comes
which
creates
the
market
is
it
really
necessary
to
tell
them
again
i
pointed
out
that
by
means
of
the
system
assistance
par
le
travail
the
return
could
be
increased
fifteenfold
one
million
would
produce
fifteen
millions
and
one
thousand
millions
fifteen
thousand
millions
this
may
be
the
case
on
a
small
scale
is
it
so
on
a
large
one
capital
surely
yields
a
return
diminishing
in
inverse
ratio
to
its
own
growth
inactive
and
inert
capital
yields
this
diminishing
return
but
active
capital
brings
in
a
marvellously
increasing
return
herein
lies
the
social
question
am
i
stating
a
fact
i
call
on
the
richest
jews
as
witnesses
of
my
veracity
why
do
they
carry
on
so
many
different
industries
why
do
they
send
men
to
work
underground
and
to
raise
coal
amid
terrible
dangers
for
meagre
pay
i
can
not
imagine
this
to
be
pleasant
even
for
the
owners
of
the
mines
for
i
do
not
believe
that
capitalists
are
heartless
and
i
do
not
pretend
that
i
believe
it
my
desire
is
not
to
accentuate
but
to
smooth
differences
is
it
necessary
to
illustrate
the
phenomenon
of
multitudes
and
their
concentration
on
a
particular
spot
by
references
to
pious
pilgrimages
i
do
not
want
to
hurt
anyone
religious
sensibility
by
words
which
might
be
wrongly
interpreted
i
shall
merely
refer
quite
briefly
to
the
mohammedan
pilgrimages
to
mecca
the
catholic
pilgrimages
to
lourdes
and
to
many
other
spots
whence
men
return
comforted
by
their
faith
and
to
the
holy
hock
at
trier
thus
we
shall
also
create
a
center
for
the
deep
religious
needs
of
our
people
our
ministers
will
understand
us
first
and
will
be
with
us
in
this
we
shall
let
every
man
find
salvation
over
there
in
his
own
particular
way
above
and
before
all
we
shall
make
room
for
the
immortal
band
of
our
freethinkers
who
are
continually
making
new
conquests
for
humanity
no
more
force
will
be
exercised
on
any
one
than
is
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
the
state
and
order
and
the
requisite
force
will
not
be
arbitrarily
defined
by
one
or
more
shifting
authorities
it
will
be
fixed
by
iron
laws
now
if
the
illustrations
i
gave
make
people
draw
the
inference
that
a
multitude
can
be
only
temporarily
attracted
to
centers
of
faith
of
business
or
of
amusement
the
reply
to
their
objection
is
simple
whereas
one
of
these
objects
by
itself
would
certainly
only
attract
the
masses
all
these
centers
of
attraction
combined
would
be
calculated
permanently
to
hold
and
satisfy
them
for
all
these
centers
together
form
a
single
great
object
which
our
people
has
always
longed
to
attain
for
which
it
has
kept
itself
alive
for
which
it
has
been
kept
alive
by
external
pressure
a
free
home
when
the
movement
commences
we
shall
draw
some
men
after
us
and
let
others
follow
others
again
will
be
swept
into
the
current
and
the
last
will
be
thrust
after
us
these
last
hesitating
settlers
will
be
the
worst
off
both
here
and
there
but
the
first
who
go
over
with
faith
enthusiasm
and
courage
will
have
the
best
positions
our
human
material
there
are
more
mistaken
notions
abroad
concerning
jews
than
concerning
any
other
people
and
we
have
become
so
depressed
and
discouraged
by
our
historic
sufferings
that
we
ourselves
repeat
and
believe
these
mistakes
one
of
these
is
that
we
have
an
immoderate
love
of
business
now
it
is
well
known
that
wherever
we
are
permitted
to
take
part
in
the
rising
of
classes
we
give
up
our
business
as
soon
as
possible
the
great
majority
of
jewish
business
men
give
their
sons
a
superior
education
hence
the
judaizing
of
all
intellectual
professions
but
even
in
economically
feebler
grades
of
society
our
love
of
trade
is
not
so
predominant
as
is
generally
supposed
in
the
eastern
countries
of
europe
there
are
great
numbers
of
jews
who
are
not
traders
and
who
are
not
afraid
of
hard
work
either
the
society
of
jews
will
be
in
a
position
to
prepare
scientifically
accurate
statistics
of
our
human
forces
the
new
tasks
and
prospects
that
await
our
people
in
the
new
country
will
satisfy
our
present
handicraftsmen
and
will
transform
many
present
small
traders
into
manual
workers
a
peddler
who
travels
about
the
country
with
a
heavy
pack
on
his
back
is
not
so
contented
as
his
persecutors
imagine
the
day
will
convert
all
of
his
kind
into
workmen
they
are
good
misunderstood
people
who
now
suffer
perhaps
more
severely
than
any
others
the
society
of
jews
will
moreover
busy
itself
from
the
outset
with
their
training
as
artisans
their
love
of
gain
will
be
encouraged
in
a
healthy
manner
jews
are
of
a
thrifty
and
adaptable
disposition
and
are
qualified
for
any
means
of
earning
a
living
and
it
will
therefore
suffice
to
make
small
trading
unremunerative
to
cause
even
present
peddlers
to
give
it
up
altogether
this
could
be
brought
about
for
example
by
encouraging
large
department
stores
which
provide
all
necessaries
of
life
these
general
stores
are
already
crushing
small
trading
in
large
cities
in
a
land
of
new
civilization
they
will
absolutely
prevent
its
existence
the
establishment
of
these
stores
is
further
advantageous
because
it
makes
the
country
immediately
habitable
for
people
who
require
more
refined
necessaries
of
life
habits
is
a
reference
to
the
little
habits
and
comforts
of
the
ordinary
man
in
keeping
with
the
serious
nature
of
this
pamphlet
i
think
it
is
in
keeping
and
moreover
very
important
for
these
little
habits
are
the
thousand
and
one
fine
delicate
threads
which
together
go
to
make
up
an
unbreakable
rope
here
certain
limited
notions
must
be
set
aside
whoever
has
seen
anything
of
the
world
knows
that
just
these
little
daily
customs
can
easily
be
transplanted
everywhere
the
technical
contrivances
of
our
day
which
this
scheme
intends
to
employ
in
the
service
of
humanity
have
heretofore
been
principally
used
for
our
little
habits
there
are
english
hotels
in
egypt
and
on
the
in
switzerland
vienna
cafes
in
south
africa
french
theatres
in
russia
german
operas
in
america
and
best
bavarian
beer
in
paris
when
we
journey
out
of
egypt
again
we
shall
not
leave
the
fleshpots
behind
every
man
will
find
his
customs
again
in
the
local
groups
but
they
will
be
better
more
beautiful
and
more
agreeable
than
before
society

this
pamphlet
is
not
intended
for
lawyers
i
can
therefore
touch
only
cursorily
as
on
so
many
other
things
upon
my
theory
of
the
legal
basis
of
a
state
i
must
nevertheless
lay
some
stress
on
my
new
theory
which
could
be
maintained
i
believe
even
in
discussion
with
men
well
versed
in
jurisprudence
according
to
rousseau
now
antiquated
view
a
state
is
formed
by
a
social
contract
rousseau
held
that
the
conditions
of
this
contract
are
so
precisely
defined
by
the
nature
of
the
agreement
that
the
slightest
alteration
would
make
them
null
and
void
the
consequence
is
that
even
where
they
are
not
expressly
stated
they
are
everywhere
identical
and
everywhere
tacitly
accepted
and
recognized
etc
a
logical
and
historic
refutation
of
rousseau
theory
was
never
nor
is
now
difficult
however
terrible
and
its
effects
may
have
been
the
question
whether
a
social
contract
with
conditions
not
expressly
stated
yet
unalterable
existed
before
the
framing
of
a
constitution
is
of
no
practical
interest
to
states
under
modern
forms
of
government
the
legal
relationship
between
government
and
citizen
is
in
any
case
clearly
established
now
but
previous
to
the
framing
of
a
constitution
and
during
the
creation
of
a
new
state
these
principles
assume
great
practical
importance
we
know
and
see
for
ourselves
that
states
still
continue
to
be
created
colonies
secede
from
the
mother
country
vassals
fall
away
from
their
suzerain
newly
opened
territories
are
immediately
formed
into
free
states
it
is
true
that
the
jewish
state
is
conceived
as
a
peculiarly
modern
structure
on
unspecified
territory
but
a
state
is
formed
not
by
pieces
of
land
but
rather
by
a
number
of
men
united
under
sovereign
rule
the
people
is
the
subjective
land
the
objective
foundation
of
a
state
and
the
subjective
basis
is
the
more
important
of
the
two
one
sovereignty
for
example
which
has
no
objective
basis
at
all
is
perhaps
the
most
respected
one
in
the
world
i
refer
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
pope
the
theory
of
rationality
is
the
one
at
present
accepted
in
political
science
this
theory
suffices
to
justify
the
creation
of
a
state
and
can
not
be
historically
refuted
in
the
same
way
as
the
theory
of
a
contract
insofar
as
i
am
concerned
only
with
the
creation
of
a
jewish
state
i
am
well
within
the
limits
of
the
theory
of
rationality
but
when
i
touch
upon
the
legal
basis
of
the
state
i
have
exceeded
them
the
theories
of
a
divine
institution
or
of
superior
power
or
of
a
contract
and
the
patriarchal
and
patrimonial
theories
do
not
accord
with
modern
views
the
legal
basis
of
a
state
is
sought
either
too
much
within
men
patriarchal
theory
and
theories
of
superior
force
and
contract
or
too
far
above
them
divine
institution
or
too
far
below
them
objective
patrimonial
theory
the
theory
of
rationality
leaves
this
question
conveniently
and
carefully
unanswered
but
a
question
which
has
seriously
occupied
doctors
of
jurisprudence
in
every
age
can
not
be
an
absolutely
idle
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
mixture
of
human
and
superhuman
goes
to
the
making
of
a
state
some
legal
basis
is
indispensable
to
explain
the
somewhat
oppressive
relationship
in
which
subjects
occasionally
stand
to
rulers
i
believe
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
wherein
the
body
of
citizens
represents
the
and
the
government
represents
the
the
romans
with
their
marvellous
sense
of
justice
produced
that
noble
masterpiece
the
when
the
property
of
an
oppressed
person
is
in
danger
any
man
may
step
forward
to
save
it
this
man
is
the
the
director
of
affairs
not
strictly
his
own
he
has
received
no
warrant
that
is
no
human
warrant
higher
obligations
authorize
him
to
act
the
higher
obligations
may
be
formulated
in
different
ways
for
the
state
and
so
as
to
respond
to
individual
degrees
of
culture
attained
by
a
growing
general
power
of
comprehension
the
is
intended
to
work
for
the
good
of
the
the
people
to
whom
the
himself
belongs
the
administers
property
of
which
he
is
his
joint
proprietorship
teaches
him
what
urgency
would
warrant
his
intervention
and
would
demand
his
leadership
in
peace
or
war
but
under
no
circumstances
is
his
authority
valid
joint
proprietorship
the
consent
of
the
numerous
is
even
under
most
favorable
conditions
a
matter
of
conjecture
a
state
is
created
by
a
nation
struggle
for
existence
in
any
such
struggle
it
is
impossible
to
obtain
proper
authority
in
circumstantial
fashion
beforehand
in
fact
any
previous
attempt
to
obtain
a
regular
decision
from
the
majority
would
probably
ruin
the
undertaking
from
the
outset
for
internal
schisms
would
make
the
people
defenceless
against
external
dangers
we
can
not
all
be
of
one
mind
the
will
therefore
simply
take
the
leadership
into
his
hands
and
march
in
the
van
the
action
of
the
of
the
state
is
sufficiently
warranted
if
the
common
cause
is
in
danger
and
the
is
prevented
either
by
want
of
will
or
by
some
other
reason
from
helping
itself
but
the
becomes
similar
to
the
by
his
intervention
and
is
bound
by
the
agreement
ex
this
is
the
legal
relationship
existing
before
or
more
correctly
created
simultaneously
with
the
state
the
thus
becomes
answerable
for
every
form
of
negligence
even
for
the
failure
of
business
undertakings
and
the
neglect
of
such
affairs
as
are
intimately
connected
with
them
etc
i
shall
not
further
enlarge
on
the
but
rather
leave
it
to
the
state
else
it
would
take
us
too
far
from
the
main
subject
one
remark
only
business
management
if
it
is
approved
by
the
owner
is
just
as
effectual
as
if
it
had
originally
been
carried
on
by
his
authority
and
how
does
all
this
affect
our
case
the
jewish
people
are
at
present
prevented
by
the
diaspora
from
conducting
their
political
affairs
themselves
besides
they
are
in
a
condition
of
more
or
less
severe
distress
in
many
parts
of
the
world
they
need
above
all
things
a
this
can
not
of
course
be
a
single
individual
such
a
one
would
either
make
himself
ridiculous
or
seeing
that
he
would
appear
to
be
working
for
his
own
interests
contemptible
the
of
the
jews
must
therefore
be
a
body
corporate
and
that
is
the
society
of
jews
the
gestor
of
the
jews
this
organ
of
the
national
movement
the
nature
and
functions
of
which
we
are
at
last
dealing
with
will
in
fact
be
created
before
everything
else
its
formation
is
perfectly
simple
it
will
take
shape
among
those
energetic
jews
to
whom
i
imparted
my
scheme
in
london
b
the
society
will
have
scientific
and
political
tasks
for
the
founding
of
a
jewish
state
as
i
conceive
it
presupposes
the
application
of
scientific
methods
we
can
not
journey
out
of
egypt
today
in
the
primitive
fashion
of
ancient
times
we
shall
previously
obtain
an
accurate
account
of
our
number
and
strength
the
undertaking
of
that
great
and
ancient
of
the
jews
in
primitive
days
bears
much
the
same
relation
to
ours
that
some
wonderful
melody
bears
to
a
modern
opera
we
are
playing
the
same
melody
with
many
more
violins
flutes
harps
violoncellos
and
bass
viols
with
electric
light
decorations
choirs
beautiful
costumes
and
with
the
first
singers
of
their
day
this
pamphlet
is
intended
to
open
a
general
discussion
on
the
jewish
question
friends
and
foes
will
take
part
in
it
but
it
will
no
longer
i
hope
take
the
form
of
violent
abuse
or
of
sentimental
vindication
but
of
a
debate
practical
large
earnest
and
political
the
society
of
jews
will
gather
all
available
declarations
of
statesmen
parliaments
jewish
communities
societies
whether
expressed
in
speeches
or
writings
in
meetings
newspapers
or
books
thus
the
society
will
find
out
for
the
first
time
whether
the
jews
really
wish
to
go
to
the
promised
land
and
whether
they
must
go
there
every
jewish
community
in
the
world
will
send
contributions
to
the
society
towards
a
comprehensive
collection
of
jewish
statistics
further
tasks
such
as
investigation
by
experts
of
the
new
country
and
its
natural
resources
the
uniform
planning
of
migration
and
settlement
preliminary
work
for
legislation
and
administration
must
be
rationally
evolved
out
of
the
original
scheme
externally
the
society
will
attempt
as
i
explained
before
in
the
general
part
to
be
acknowledged
as
a
power
the
free
assent
of
many
jews
will
confer
on
it
the
requisite
authority
in
its
relations
with
governments
internally
that
is
to
say
in
its
relation
with
the
jewish
people
the
society
will
create
all
the
first
indispensable
institutions
it
will
be
the
nucleus
out
of
which
the
public
institutions
of
the
jewish
state
will
later
on
be
developed
our
first
object
is
as
i
said
before
supremacy
assured
to
us
by
international
law
over
a
portion
of
the
globe
sufficiently
large
to
satisfy
our
just
requirements
what
is
the
next
step
the
occupation
of
the
land
when
nations
wandered
in
historic
times
they
let
chance
carry
them
draw
them
fling
them
hither
and
thither
and
like
swarms
of
locusts
they
settled
down
indifferently
anywhere
for
in
historic
times
the
earth
was
not
known
to
man
but
this
modern
jewish
migration
must
proceed
in
accordance
with
scientific
principles
not
more
than
forty
years
ago
was
carried
on
in
an
extraordinarily
primitive
fashion
what
adventurous
days
were
those
in
california
a
report
brought
desperados
together
from
every
quarter
of
the
earth
they
stole
pieces
of
land
robbed
each
other
of
gold
and
finally
gambled
it
away
as
robbers
do
but
today
what
is
like
in
the
transvaal
today
adventurous
vagabonds
are
not
there
sedate
geologists
and
engineers
alone
are
on
the
spot
to
regulate
its
gold
industry
and
to
employ
ingenious
machinery
in
separating
the
ore
from
surrounding
rock
little
is
left
to
chance
now
thus
we
must
investigate
and
take
possession
of
the
new
jewish
country
by
means
of
every
modern
expedient
as
soon
as
we
have
secured
the
land
we
shall
send
over
a
ship
having
on
board
the
representatives
of
the
society
of
the
company
and
of
the
local
groups
who
will
enter
into
possession
at
once
these
men
will
have
three
tasks
to
perform
an
accurate
scientific
investigation
of
all
natural
resources
of
the
country
the
organization
of
a
strictly
centralized
administration
the
distribution
of
land
these
tasks
intersect
one
another
and
will
all
be
carried
out
in
conformity
with
the
now
familiar
object
in
view
one
thing
remains
to
be
explained
namely
how
the
occupation
of
land
according
to
local
groups
is
to
take
place
in
america
the
occupation
of
newly
opened
territory
is
set
about
in
naive
fashion
the
settlers
assemble
on
the
frontier
and
at
the
appointed
time
make
a
simultaneous
and
violent
rush
for
their
portions
we
shall
not
proceed
thus
to
the
new
land
of
the
jews
the
lots
in
provinces
and
towns
will
be
sold
by
auction
and
paid
for
not
in
money
but
in
work
the
general
plan
will
have
settled
on
streets
bridges
waterworks
necessary
for
traffic
these
will
be
united
into
provinces
within
these
provinces
sites
for
towns
will
be
similarly
sold
by
auction
the
local
groups
will
pledge
themselves
to
carry
the
business
property
through
and
will
cover
the
cost
by
means
of
assessments
the
society
will
be
in
a
position
to
judge
whether
the
local
groups
are
not
venturing
on
sacrifices
too
great
for
their
means
the
large
communities
will
receive
large
sites
for
their
activity
great
sacrifices
will
thus
be
rewarded
by
the
establishment
of
universities
technical
schools
academies
research
institutes
and
these
government
institutes
which
do
not
have
to
be
concentrated
in
the
capital
will
be
distributed
over
the
country
the
personal
interest
of
the
buyers
and
if
necessary
the
local
assessment
will
guarantee
the
proper
working
of
what
has
been
taken
over
in
the
same
way
as
we
can
not
and
indeed
do
not
wish
to
obliterate
distinctions
between
single
individuals
so
the
differences
between
local
groups
will
also
continue
everything
will
shape
itself
quite
naturally
all
acquired
rights
will
be
protected
and
every
new
development
will
be
given
sufficient
scope
our
people
will
be
made
thoroughly
acquainted
with
all
these
matters
we
shall
not
take
others
unawares
or
mislead
them
any
more
than
we
shall
deceive
ourselves
everything
must
be
systematically
settled
beforehand
i
merely
indicate
this
scheme
our
keenest
thinkers
will
combine
in
elaborating
it
every
social
and
technical
achievement
of
our
age
and
of
the
more
advanced
age
which
will
be
reached
before
the
slow
execution
of
my
plan
is
accomplished
must
be
employed
for
this
object
every
valuable
invention
which
exists
now
or
lies
in
the
future
must
be
used
by
these
means
a
country
can
be
occupied
and
a
state
founded
in
a
manner
as
yet
unknown
to
history
and
with
possibilities
of
success
such
as
never
occurred
before
constitution
one
of
the
great
commissions
which
the
society
will
have
to
appoint
will
be
the
council
of
state
jurists
these
must
formulate
the
best
that
is
the
best
modern
constitution
possible
i
believe
that
a
good
constitution
should
be
of
moderately
elastic
nature
in
another
work
i
have
explained
in
detail
what
forms
of
government
i
hold
to
be
the
best
i
think
a
democratic
monarchy
and
an
aristocratic
republic
are
the
finest
forms
of
a
state
because
in
them
the
form
of
state
and
the
principle
of
government
are
opposed
to
each
other
and
thus
preserve
a
true
balance
of
power
i
am
a
staunch
supporter
of
monarchial
institutions
because
these
allow
of
a
continuous
policy
and
represent
the
interests
of
a
historically
famous
family
born
and
educated
to
rule
whose
desires
are
bound
up
with
the
preservation
of
the
state
but
our
history
has
been
too
long
interrupted
for
us
to
attempt
direct
continuity
of
ancient
constitutional
forms
without
exposing
ourselves
to
the
charge
of
absurdity
a
democracy
without
a
sovereign
useful
counterpoise
is
extreme
in
appreciation
and
condemnation
tends
to
idle
discussion
in
parliaments
and
produces
that
objectionable
class
of
men
professional
politicians
nations
are
also
really
not
fit
for
unlimited
democracy
at
present
and
will
become
less
and
less
fitted
for
it
in
the
future
for
a
pure
democracy
presupposes
a
predominance
of
simple
customs
and
our
customs
become
daily
more
complex
with
the
growth
of
commerce
and
increase
of
culture
ressort
democratic
est
la
said
wise
montesquieu
and
where
is
this
virtue
that
is
to
say
this
political
virtue
to
be
met
with
i
do
not
believe
in
our
political
virtue
first
because
we
are
no
better
than
the
rest
of
modern
humanity
and
secondly
because
freedom
will
make
us
show
our
fighting
qualities
at
first
i
also
hold
a
settling
of
questions
by
the
referendum
to
be
an
unsatisfactory
procedure
because
there
are
no
simple
political
questions
which
can
be
answered
merely
by
yes
and
no
the
masses
are
also
more
prone
even
than
parliaments
to
be
led
away
by
heterodox
opinions
and
to
be
swayed
by
vigorous
ranting
it
is
impossible
to
formulate
a
wise
internal
or
external
policy
in
a
popular
assembly
politics
must
take
shape
in
the
upper
strata
and
work
downwards
but
no
member
of
the
jewish
state
will
be
oppressed
every
man
will
be
able
and
will
wish
to
rise
in
it
thus
a
great
upward
tendency
will
pass
through
our
people
every
individual
by
trying
to
raise
himself
raising
also
the
whole
body
of
citizens
the
ascent
will
take
a
normal
form
useful
to
the
state
and
serviceable
to
the
national
idea
hence
i
incline
to
an
aristocratic
republic
this
would
satisfy
the
ambitious
spirit
in
our
people
which
has
now
degenerated
into
petty
vanity
many
of
the
institutions
of
venice
pass
through
my
mind
but
all
that
which
caused
the
ruin
of
venice
must
be
carefully
avoided
we
shall
learn
from
the
historic
mistakes
of
others
in
the
same
way
as
we
learn
from
our
own
for
we
are
a
modern
nation
and
wish
to
be
the
most
modern
in
the
world
our
people
who
are
receiving
the
new
country
from
the
society
will
also
thankfully
accept
the
new
constitution
it
offers
them
should
any
opposition
manifest
itself
the
society
will
suppress
it
the
society
can
not
permit
the
exercise
of
its
functions
to
be
interpreted
by
or
individuals
language
it
might
be
suggested
that
our
want
of
a
common
current
language
would
present
difficulties
we
can
not
converse
with
one
another
in
hebrew
who
amongst
us
has
a
sufficient
acquaintance
with
hebrew
to
ask
for
a
railway
ticket
in
that
language
such
a
thing
can
not
be
done
yet
the
difficulty
is
very
easily
circumvented
every
man
can
preserve
the
language
in
which
his
thoughts
are
at
home
switzerland
affords
a
conclusive
proof
of
the
possibility
of
a
federation
of
tongues
we
shall
remain
in
the
new
country
what
we
now
are
here
and
we
shall
never
cease
to
cherish
with
sadness
the
memory
of
the
native
land
out
of
which
we
have
been
driven
we
shall
give
up
using
those
miserable
stunted
jargons
those
ghetto
languages
which
we
still
employ
for
these
were
the
stealthy
tongues
of
prisoners
our
national
teachers
will
give
due
attention
to
this
matter
and
the
language
which
proves
itself
to
be
of
greatest
utility
for
general
intercourse
will
be
adopted
without
compulsion
as
our
national
tongue
our
community
of
race
is
peculiar
and
unique
for
we
are
bound
together
only
by
the
faith
of
our
fathers
theocracy
shall
we
end
by
having
a
theocracy
no
indeed
faith
unites
us
knowledge
gives
us
freedom
we
shall
therefore
prevent
any
theocratic
tendencies
from
coming
to
the
fore
on
the
part
of
our
priesthood
we
shall
keep
our
priests
within
the
confines
of
their
temples
in
the
same
way
as
we
shall
keep
our
professional
army
within
the
confines
of
their
barracks
army
and
priesthood
shall
receive
honors
high
as
their
valuable
functions
deserve
but
they
must
not
interfere
in
the
administration
of
the
state
which
confers
distinction
upon
them
else
they
will
conjure
up
difficulties
without
and
within
every
man
will
be
as
free
and
undisturbed
in
his
faith
or
his
disbelief
as
he
is
in
his
nationality
and
if
it
should
occur
that
men
of
other
creeds
and
different
nationalities
come
to
live
amongst
us
we
should
accord
them
honorable
protection
and
equality
before
the
law
we
have
learnt
toleration
in
europe
this
is
not
sarcastically
said
for
the
of
today
could
only
in
a
very
few
places
be
taken
for
old
religious
intolerance
it
is
for
the
most
part
a
movement
among
civilized
nations
by
which
they
try
to
chase
away
the
spectres
of
their
own
past
laws
when
the
idea
of
a
state
begins
to
approach
realization
the
society
of
jews
will
appoint
a
council
of
jurists
to
do
the
preparatory
work
of
legislation
during
the
transition
period
these
must
act
on
the
principle
that
every
emigrant
jew
is
to
be
judged
according
to
the
laws
of
the
country
which
he
has
left
but
they
must
try
to
bring
about
a
unification
of
these
various
laws
to
form
a
modern
system
of
legislation
based
on
the
best
portions
of
previous
systems
this
might
become
a
typical
codification
embodying
all
the
just
social
claims
of
the
present
day
the
army
the
jewish
state
is
conceived
as
a
neutral
one
it
will
therefore
require
only
a
professional
army
equipped
of
course
with
every
requisite
of
modern
warfare
to
preserve
order
internally
and
externally
the
flag
we
have
no
flag
and
we
need
one
if
we
desire
to
lead
many
men
we
must
raise
a
symbol
above
their
heads
i
would
suggest
a
white
flag
with
seven
golden
stars
the
white
field
symbolizes
our
pure
new
life
the
stars
are
the
seven
golden
hours
of
our
for
we
shall
march
into
the
promised
land
carrying
the
badge
of
honor
reciprocity
and
extradition
treaties
the
new
jewish
state
must
be
properly
founded
with
due
regard
to
our
future
honorable
position
in
the
world
therefore
every
obligation
in
the
old
country
must
be
scrupulously
fulfilled
before
leaving
the
society
of
jews
and
the
jewish
company
will
grant
cheap
passage
and
certain
advantages
in
settlement
to
those
only
who
can
present
an
official
testimonial
from
the
local
authorities
certifying
that
they
have
left
their
affairs
in
good
order
every
just
private
claim
originating
in
the
abandoned
countries
will
be
heard
more
readily
in
the
jewish
state
than
anywhere
else
we
shall
not
wait
for
reciprocity
we
shall
act
purely
for
the
sake
of
our
own
honor
we
shall
thus
perhaps
find
later
on
that
law
courts
will
be
more
willing
to
hear
our
claims
than
now
seems
to
be
the
case
in
some
places
it
will
be
inferred
as
a
matter
of
course
from
previous
remarks
that
we
shall
deliver
up
jewish
criminals
more
readily
than
any
other
state
would
do
till
the
time
comes
when
we
can
enforce
our
penal
code
on
the
same
principles
as
every
other
civilized
nation
does
there
will
therefore
be
a
period
of
transition
during
which
we
shall
receive
our
criminals
only
after
they
have
suffered
due
penalties
but
having
made
amends
they
will
be
received
without
any
restrictions
whatever
for
our
criminals
also
must
enter
upon
a
new
life
thus
emigration
may
become
to
many
jews
a
crisis
with
a
happy
issue
bad
external
circumstances
which
ruin
many
a
character
will
be
removed
and
this
change
may
mean
salvation
to
many
who
are
lost
here
i
should
like
briefly
to
relate
a
story
i
came
across
in
an
account
of
the
gold
mines
of
witwatersrand
one
day
a
man
came
to
the
rand
settled
there
tried
his
hand
at
various
things
with
the
exception
of
gold
mining
till
he
founded
an
ice
factory
which
did
well
he
soon
won
universal
esteem
by
his
respectability
but
after
some
years
he
was
suddenly
arrested
he
had
committed
some
defalcations
as
banker
in
frankfort
had
fled
from
there
and
had
begun
a
new
life
under
an
assumed
name
but
when
he
was
led
away
as
prisoner
the
most
respected
people
in
the
place
appeared
at
the
station
bade
him
a
cordial
farewell
and
for
he
was
certain
to
return
how
much
this
story
reveals
a
new
life
can
regenerate
even
criminals
and
we
have
a
proportionately
small
number
of
these
some
interesting
statistics
on
this
point
are
worth
reading
entitled
the
criminality
of
jews
in
germany
by
nathan
of
berlin
who
was
commissioned
by
the
society
for
defense
against
to
make
a
collection
of
statistics
based
on
official
returns
it
is
true
that
this
pamphlet
which
teems
with
figures
has
been
prompted
as
many
another
defence
by
the
error
that
can
be
refuted
by
reasonable
arguments
we
are
probably
disliked
as
much
for
our
gifts
as
we
are
for
our
faults
benefits
of
the
emigration
of
the
jews
i
imagine
that
governments
will
either
voluntarily
or
under
pressure
from
the
pay
certain
attention
to
this
scheme
and
they
may
perhaps
actually
receive
it
here
and
there
with
a
sympathy
which
they
will
also
show
to
the
society
of
jews
for
the
emigration
which
i
suggest
will
not
create
any
economic
crises
such
crises
as
would
follow
everywhere
in
consequence
of
would
rather
be
prevented
by
the
carrying
out
of
my
plan
a
great
period
of
prosperity
would
commence
in
countries
which
are
now
for
there
will
be
as
i
have
repeatedly
said
an
internal
migration
of
christian
citizens
into
the
positions
slowly
and
systematically
evacuated
by
the
jews
if
we
are
not
merely
suffered
but
actually
assisted
to
do
this
the
movement
will
have
a
generally
beneficial
effect
that
is
a
narrow
view
from
which
one
should
free
oneself
which
sees
in
the
departure
of
many
jews
a
consequent
impoverishment
of
countries
it
is
different
from
a
departure
which
is
a
result
of
persecution
for
then
property
is
indeed
destroyed
as
it
is
ruined
in
the
confusion
of
war
different
again
is
the
peaceable
voluntary
departure
of
colonists
wherein
everything
is
carried
out
with
due
consideration
for
acquired
rights
and
with
absolute
conformity
to
law
openly
and
by
light
of
day
under
the
eyes
of
the
authorities
and
the
control
of
public
opinion
the
emigration
of
christian
proletarians
to
different
parts
of
the
world
would
be
brought
to
a
standstill
by
the
jewish
movement
the
states
would
have
a
further
advantage
in
the
enormous
increase
of
their
export
trade
for
since
the
emigrant
jews
over
there
would
depend
for
a
long
time
to
come
on
european
productions
they
would
necessarily
have
to
import
them
the
local
groups
would
keep
up
a
just
balance
and
the
customary
needs
would
have
to
be
supplied
for
a
long
time
at
the
accustomed
places
another
and
perhaps
one
of
the
greatest
advantages
would
be
the
ensuing
social
relief
social
dissatisfaction
would
be
appeased
during
the
twenty
or
more
years
which
the
emigration
of
the
jews
would
occupy
and
would
in
any
case
be
set
at
rest
during
the
whole
transition
period
the
shape
which
the
social
question
may
take
depends
entirely
on
the
development
of
our
technical
resources
steampower
concentrated
men
in
factories
about
machinery
where
they
were
overcrowded
and
where
they
made
one
another
miserable
by
overcrowding
our
present
enormous
injudicious
and
unsystematic
rate
of
production
is
the
cause
of
continual
severe
crises
which
ruin
both
employers
and
employees
steam
crowded
men
together
electricity
will
probably
scatter
them
again
and
may
perhaps
bring
about
a
more
prosperous
condition
of
the
labor
market
in
any
case
our
technical
inventors
who
are
the
true
benefactors
of
humanity
will
continue
their
labors
after
the
commencement
of
the
emigration
of
the
jews
and
they
will
discover
things
as
marvellous
as
those
we
have
already
seen
or
indeed
more
wonderful
even
than
these
the
word
impossible
has
ceased
to
exist
in
the
vocabulary
of
technical
science
were
a
man
who
lived
in
the
last
century
to
return
to
the
earth
he
would
find
the
life
of
today
full
of
incomprehensible
magic
wherever
the
moderns
appear
with
our
inventions
we
transform
the
desert
into
a
garden
to
build
a
city
takes
in
our
time
as
many
years
as
it
formerly
required
centuries
america
offers
endless
examples
of
this
distance
has
ceased
to
be
an
obstacle
the
spirit
of
our
age
has
gathered
fabulous
treasures
into
its
storehouse
every
day
this
wealth
increases
a
hundred
thousand
heads
are
occupied
with
speculations
and
research
at
every
point
of
the
globe
and
what
any
one
discovers
belongs
the
next
moment
to
the
whole
world
we
ourselves
will
use
and
carry
on
every
new
attempt
in
our
jewish
land
and
just
as
we
shall
introduce
the
day
as
an
experiment
for
the
good
of
humanity
so
we
shall
proceed
in
everything
else
in
the
same
humane
spirit
making
of
the
new
land
a
land
of
experiments
and
a
model
state
after
the
departure
of
the
jews
the
undertakings
which
they
have
created
will
remain
where
they
originally
were
found
and
the
jewish
spirit
of
enterprise
will
not
even
fail
where
people
welcome
it
for
jewish
capitalists
will
be
glad
to
invest
their
funds
where
they
are
familiar
with
surrounding
conditions
and
whereas
jewish
money
is
now
sent
out
of
countries
on
account
of
existing
persecutions
and
is
sunk
in
most
distant
foreign
undertakings
it
will
flow
back
again
in
consequence
of
this
peaceable
solution
and
will
contribute
to
the
further
progress
of
the
countries
which
the
jews
have
left
footnotes
b
herzl
addressed
a
meeting
of
the
maccabean
club
at
which
israel
zangwill
presided
on
november
how
much
has
been
left
unexplained
how
many
defects
how
many
harmful
superficialities
and
how
many
useless
repetitions
in
this
pamphlet
which
i
have
thought
over
so
long
and
so
often
revised
but
a
reader
who
has
sufficient
understanding
to
grasp
the
spirit
of
my
words
will
not
be
repelled
by
these
defects
he
will
rather
be
roused
thereby
to
cooperate
with
his
intelligence
and
energy
in
a
work
which
is
not
one
man
task
alone
and
to
improve
it
have
i
not
explained
obvious
things
and
overlooked
important
objections
i
have
tried
to
meet
certain
objections
but
i
know
that
many
more
will
be
made
based
on
high
grounds
and
low
to
the
first
class
of
objections
belongs
the
remark
that
the
jews
are
not
the
only
people
in
the
world
who
are
in
a
condition
of
distress
here
i
would
reply
that
we
may
as
well
begin
by
removing
a
little
of
this
misery
even
if
it
should
at
first
be
no
more
than
our
own
it
might
further
be
said
that
we
ought
not
to
create
new
distinctions
between
people
we
ought
not
to
raise
fresh
barriers
we
should
rather
make
the
old
disappear
but
men
who
think
in
this
way
are
amiable
visionaries
and
the
idea
of
a
native
land
will
still
flourish
when
the
dust
of
their
bones
will
have
vanished
tracelessly
in
the
winds
universal
brotherhood
is
not
even
a
beautiful
dream
antagonism
is
essential
to
man
greatest
efforts
but
the
jews
once
settled
in
their
own
state
would
probably
have
no
more
enemies
as
for
those
who
remain
behind
since
prosperity
enfeebles
and
causes
them
to
diminish
they
would
soon
disappear
altogether
i
think
the
jews
will
always
have
sufficient
enemies
such
as
every
nation
has
but
once
fixed
in
their
own
land
it
will
no
longer
be
possible
for
them
to
scatter
all
over
the
world
the
diaspora
can
not
be
reborn
unless
the
civilization
of
the
whole
earth
should
collapse
and
such
a
consummation
could
be
feared
by
none
but
foolish
men
our
present
civilization
possesses
weapons
powerful
enough
for
its
innumerable
objections
will
be
based
on
low
grounds
for
there
are
more
low
men
than
noble
in
this
world
i
have
tried
to
remove
some
of
these
notions
and
whoever
is
willing
to
fall
in
behind
our
white
flag
with
its
seven
stars
must
assist
in
this
campaign
of
enlightenment
perhaps
we
shall
have
to
fight
first
of
all
against
many
an
member
of
our
own
race
again
people
will
say
that
i
am
furnishing
the
with
weapons
why
so
because
i
admit
the
truth
because
i
do
not
maintain
that
there
are
none
but
excellent
men
against
us
will
not
people
say
that
i
am
showing
our
enemies
the
way
to
injure
us
this
i
absolutely
dispute
my
proposal
could
only
be
carried
out
with
the
free
consent
of
a
majority
of
jews
action
may
be
taken
against
individuals
or
even
against
groups
of
the
most
powerful
jews
but
governments
will
never
take
action
against
all
jews
the
equal
rights
of
the
jew
before
the
law
can
not
be
withdrawn
where
they
have
once
been
conceded
for
the
first
attempt
at
withdrawal
would
immediately
drive
all
jews
rich
and
poor
alike
into
the
ranks
of
revolutionary
parties
the
beginning
of
any
official
acts
of
injustice
against
the
jews
invariably
brings
about
economic
crises
therefore
no
weapons
can
be
effectually
used
against
us
because
these
injure
the
hands
that
wield
them
meantime
hatred
grows
apace
the
rich
do
not
feel
it
much
but
our
poor
do
let
us
ask
our
poor
who
have
been
more
severely
proletarized
since
the
last
removal
of
than
ever
before
some
of
our
prosperous
men
may
say
that
the
pressure
is
not
yet
severe
enough
to
justify
emigration
and
that
every
forcible
expulsion
shows
how
unwilling
our
people
are
to
depart
true
because
they
do
not
know
where
to
go
because
they
only
pass
from
one
trouble
into
another
but
we
are
showing
them
the
way
to
the
promised
land
and
the
splendid
force
of
enthusiasm
must
fight
against
the
terrible
force
of
habit
persecutions
are
no
longer
so
malignant
as
they
were
in
the
middle
ages
true
but
our
sensitiveness
has
increased
so
that
we
feel
no
diminution
in
our
sufferings
prolonged
persecution
has
overstrained
our
nerves
will
people
say
again
that
our
enterprise
is
hopeless
because
even
if
we
obtained
the
land
with
supremacy
over
it
the
poor
only
would
go
with
us
it
is
precisely
the
poorest
whom
we
need
at
first
only
the
desperate
make
good
conquerors
will
some
one
say
were
it
feasible
it
would
have
been
done
long
ago
it
has
never
yet
been
possible
now
it
is
possible
a
hundred
or
even
fifty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
nothing
more
than
a
dream
today
it
may
become
a
reality
our
rich
who
have
a
pleasurable
acquaintance
with
all
our
technical
achievements
know
full
well
how
much
money
can
do
and
thus
it
will
be
just
the
poor
and
simple
who
do
not
know
what
power
man
already
exercises
over
the
forces
of
nature
just
these
will
have
the
firmest
faith
in
the
new
message
for
these
have
never
lost
their
hope
of
the
promised
land
here
it
is
fellow
jews
neither
fable
nor
deception
every
man
may
test
its
reality
for
himself
for
every
man
will
carry
over
with
him
a
portion
of
the
promised
land
one
in
his
head
another
in
his
arms
another
in
his
acquired
possessions
now
all
this
may
appear
to
be
an
interminably
long
affair
even
in
the
most
favorable
circumstances
many
years
might
elapse
before
the
commencement
of
the
foundation
of
the
state
in
the
meantime
jews
in
a
thousand
different
places
would
suffer
insults
mortifications
abuse
blows
depredation
and
death
no
if
we
only
begin
to
carry
out
the
plans
would
stop
at
once
and
for
ever
for
it
is
the
conclusion
of
peace
the
news
of
the
formation
of
our
jewish
company
will
be
carried
in
a
single
day
to
the
remotest
ends
of
the
earth
by
the
lightning
speed
of
our
telegraph
wires
and
immediate
relief
will
ensue
the
intellects
which
we
produce
so
superabundantly
in
our
middle
classes
will
find
an
outlet
in
our
first
organizations
as
our
first
technicians
officers
professors
officials
lawyers
and
doctors
and
thus
the
movement
will
continue
in
swift
but
smooth
progression
prayers
will
be
offered
up
for
the
success
of
our
work
in
temples
and
in
churches
also
for
it
will
bring
relief
from
an
old
burden
which
all
have
suffered
but
we
must
first
bring
enlightenment
to
men
minds
the
idea
must
make
its
way
into
the
most
distant
miserable
holes
where
our
people
dwell
they
will
awaken
from
gloomy
brooding
for
into
their
lives
will
come
a
new
significance
every
man
need
think
only
of
himself
and
the
movement
will
assume
vast
proportions
and
what
glory
awaits
those
who
fight
unselfishly
for
the
cause
therefore
i
believe
that
a
wondrous
generation
of
jews
will
spring
into
existence
the
maccabeans
will
rise
again
let
me
repeat
once
more
my
opening
words
the
jews
who
wish
for
a
state
will
have
it
we
shall
live
at
last
as
free
men
on
our
own
soil
and
die
peacefully
in
our
own
homes
the
world
will
be
freed
by
our
liberty
enriched
by
our
wealth
magnified
by
our
greatness
and
whatever
we
attempt
there
to
accomplish
for
our
own
welfare
will
react
powerfully
and
beneficially
for
the
good
of
humanity
