the

perhaps
more
helpful
than
some
contemporary
alternatives
much
is
left
to
the

there
is

the
long
continued
popularity
of
readers
is
sufficient
evidence
of
the
positive
merits
of
the
books
the
aim
of
this
revision
has
been
to
preserve
unimpaired
the
distinctive
features
of
the
series
and
at
the
same
time
to
present
the
matter
in
a
new
dress
with
new
type
new
illustrations
and
with
a
considerable
amount
of
new
matter
spelling
exercises
are
continued
through
the
first
half
of
the
third
reader
these
exercises
with
those
furnished
in
the
two
lower
books
are
exhaustive
of
the
words
employed
in
the
reading
lessons
words
are
not
repeated
in
the
vocabularies
in
the
latter
half
of
the
book
definitions
are
introduced
it
is
hoped
that
the
teacher
will
extend
this
defining
exercise
to
all
the
words
of
the
lesson
liable
to
be
misunderstood
the
child
should
define
the
word
in
his
own
language
sufficiently
to
show
that
he
has
a
mastery
of
the
word
in
its
use
drills
in
articulation
and
emphasis
should
be
given
with
every
lesson
the
essentials
of
good
reading
are
not
to
be
taught
by
one
or
two
lessons
constant
drill
on
good
exercises
with
frequent
exhibitions
of
the
correct
method
from
the
teacher
will
be
found
more
effectual
than
any
form
prescribed
in
type
if
the
pupils
are
not
familiar
with
the
diacritical
marks
they
should
be
carefully
taught
such
instruction
constitutes
an
excellent
drill
on
articulation
and
enables
the
pupils
to
use

dictionary

intelligence

introduction
articulation
a
distinct
articulation
can
only
be
gained
by
constant
and
careful
practice
of
the
elementary
sounds
whenever
a
word
is
imperfectly
enunciated
the
teacher
should
call
attention
to
the
sounds
composing
the
spoken
word
if
the
pupil
fails
to
sound
any
element
correctly
as
in
the
case
of
lisping
the
fault
can
be
overcome
by
calling
attention
to
the
correct
position
of
the
organs
of
speech
and
insisting
upon
exact
execution
except
in
case
of
malformation
of
these
organs
every
pupil
should
sound
each
element
correctly
before
such
drill
should
cease

emphasis
if
the
pupil
has
received
proper
oral
instruction
he
has
been
taught
to
understand
what
he
has
read
and
has
already
acquired
the
habit
of
emphasizing
words
he
is
now
prepared
for
a
more
formal
introduction
to
the
subject
of
emphasis
and
for
more
particular
attention
to
its
first
principles
this
lesson
and
the
examples
given
should
be
repeatedly
practiced
in
reading
and
in
talking
we
always
speak
some
words
with
more
force
than
others
we
do
this
because
the
meaning
of
what
we
say
depends
most
upon
these
words
if
i
wish
to
know
whether
it
is
george
or
his
brother
who
is
sick
i
speak
the
words
george
and
brother
with
more
force
than
the
other
words
i
say
is
it
george
or
his
brother
who
is
sick
this
greater
force
with
which
we
speak
the
words
is
called
emphasis
the
words
upon
which
emphasis
is
put
are
sometimes
printed
in
slanting
letters
called
italics
and
sometimes
in
capitals
the
words
printed
in
italics
in
the
following
questions
and
answers
should
be
read
with
more
force
than
the
other
words

the
sparkle
was
all
in
his
eyes
oh
he
sang
like
a
bird

summer

if
sometimes
you
fancied
a
bleat
that
too
was
the
voice
of
the
shepherd

not
of
the
lambs

the

cows
were
so
gentle
that
they
moved

touch

the

was
only

his
brooklet
was
just

this

pussy
knocked

flitted
across

gone

broke

losing
a

is
quite
another

answered
joe
a

dashed
the

was
gone
forever

your
blocks
were
as

you
had

that
crying
was
of
any
more
use
in

sticks

paper
are
easily
found

you
had
only

a

upset

the

came

he
dug
up
at

they
kept
a

found
he
was

would

they

this

all

first
i
would
have
a

close

and
would
have
planks
laid
across

that
the
elephant
could
walk
right
into

oh
such
a

heavy
beast
would
make
it
sink
low
in

it
would
said

then
i
would
mark
on

the
boat
the

height
to
which
the
water
had
risen
all
around
it

was

he
should

i
do
see
the
use

all
this
said

do
you

bring

would
sink
it
to

george
worked
very
hard
so
that
by
the
time
the
sun
was
high
he
was
hot
and
wished
for
a
cool
place
where
he
might
rest
and
eat
his
dinner
while
he
hunted
about
the
bank
he
saw
among
the
moss
some
fine
wild
strawberries
which
were
a
bright
scarlet
with
ripeness
eclectic
series
how
good
these
will
be
with
my
bread
and
butter
thought
george
and
lining
his
little
cap
with
leaves
he
set
to
work
eagerly
to
gather
all
he
could
find
and
then
seated
himself
by
the
brook
it
was
a
pleasant
place
and
george
felt
happy
and
contented
he
thought
how
much
his
mother
would
like
to
see
him
there
and
to
be
there
herself
instead
of
in
her
dark
close
room
in
the
village
george
thought
of
all
this
and
just
as
he
was
lifting
the
first
strawberry
to
his
mouth
he
said
to
himself
how
much
mother
would
like
these
and
he
stopped
and
put
the
strawberry
back
again
shall
i
save
them
for
her
said
he
thinking
how
much
they
would
refresh
her
yet
still
looking
at
them
with
a
longing
eye
i
will
eat
half
and
take
the
other
half
to
her
said
he
at
last
and
he
divided
them
into
two
heaps
but
each
heap
looked
so
small
that
he
put
them
together
again
i
will
only
taste
one
thought
he
but
as
he
again
lifted
it
to
his
mouth
he
saw
that
he
had
taken
the
finest
and
he
put
it
back
i
will
keep
them
all
for
her
third
reader
said
he
and
he
covered
them
up
nicely
till
he
should
go
home
when
the
sun
was
beginning
to
sink
george
set
out
for
home
how
happy
he
felt
then
that
he
had
all
his
strawberries
for
his
sick
mother
the
nearer
he
came
to
his
home
the
less
he
wished
to
taste
them
just
as
he
had
thrown
down
his
wood
he
heard
his
mother
faint
voice
calling
him
from
the
next
room
is
that
you
george
i
am
glad
you
have
come
for
i
am
thirsty
and
am
longing
for
some
tea
george
ran
in
to
her
and
joyfully
offered
his
wild
strawberries
and
you
saved
them
for
your
sick
mother
did
you
said
she
laying
her
hand
fondly
on
his
head
while
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
god
will
bless
you
for
all
this

wanted

said

at

you

fred
took
any

in

not
a

did

take
he
was
conscious
all
the

eclectic

not

tom
suspicion
interfered
sadly

finally
it
became
such

torment

him
that
he
had
serious
thoughts

burning

burying

giving
it

a
better

suggested
itself

he
one
day
at
recess
did
you
say
you
thought
you
knew
who
owned
that
knife
i
found
yes
i
did
it
looked
like
doctor
perry
and
tom
ran
off
to
his
play
without
giving
the

thought
perry
why
fred
would
have

to
go

he
started

found
the

i
lost

bats
bats
are
very
strange
little
animals
having
hair
like
mice
and
wings
like
birds
during
the
day
they
live
in
crevices
of
rocks
in
caves
and
in
other
dark
places
at
night
they
go
forth
in
search
of
food
and
no
doubt
you
have
seen
them
flying
eclectic
series
about
catching
such
insects
as
happen
to
be
out
rather
late
at
night
the
wings
of
a
bat
have
no
quills
they
are
only
thin
pieces
of
skin
stretched
upon
a
framework
of
bones
besides
this
it
may
be
said
that
while
he
is
a
quadruped
he
can
rise
into
the
air
and
fly
from
place
to
place
like
a
bird
there
is
a
funny
fable
about
the
bat
founded
upon
this
double
character
of
beast
and
bird
which
i
will
tell
you
an
owl
was
once
prowling
about
when
he
came
across
a
bat
so
he
caught
him
in
his
claws
and
was
about
to
devour
him
upon
this
the
bat
began
to
squeal
terribly
and
he
said
to
the
owl
pray
what
do
you
take
me
for
that
you
use
me
thus
why
you
are
a
bird
to
be
sure
said
the
owl
and
i
am
fond
of
birds
i
love
dearly
to
break
their
little
bones
well
said
the
bat
i
thought
there
was
some
mistake
i
am
no
bird
do
you
see
owl
that
i
have
no
feathers
and
that
i
am
covered
with
hair
like
a
mouse
sure
enough
said
the
owl
in
great
surprise
i
see
it
now
really
i
took
you
third
reader
for
a
bird
but
it
appears
you
are
only
a
kind
of
mouse
i
ate
a
mouse
last
night
and
it
gave
me
the
nightmare
i
ca
bear
mice
bah
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
it
so
the
owl
let
the
bat
go
the
very
next
night
the
bat
encountered
another
danger
he
was
snapped
up
by
puss
who
took
him
for
a
mouse
and
immediately
prepared
to
eat
him
i
beg
you
to
stop
one
moment
said
the
bat
pray
miss
puss
what
do
you
suppose
i
am
a
mouse
to
be
sure
said
the
cat
not
at
all
said
the
bat
spreading
his
long
wings

enough
said
the

you
seem
to
be
a
bird
though
your
feathers
are
eclectic

very
fine
i
eat
birds
sometimes
but
i
am
tired
of
them
just
now

you
may
go
but
bird
or
mouse
it
will
be
your
best
policy

keep

the
meaning
of
this
fable
is
that
a
person
playing
a
double
part
may
sometimes
escape
danger
but
he
is
always
like

him
so
too
when
you
have
read

liked
well
enough

yet
he
liked
better
to
be
alone
under
the
shade
of
some
tree
reading
a
fairy
tale
or
dreaming
daydreams
but
there
was
one
sport
that
he
liked
as
well
as
his
companions
that
was
kiteflying
one
day
when
he
was
flying
his
kite
he
said
to
himself
i
wonder
if
anybody
ever
tried
to
fly
a
kite
at
night
it
seems
eclectic
series
to
me
it
would
be
nice
but
then
if
it
were
very
dark
the
kite
could
not
be
seen
what
if
i
should
fasten
a
light
to
it
though
that
would
make
it
show
i
try
it
this
very
night
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
without
saying
a
word
to
anybody
he
took
his
kite
and
lantern
and
went
to
a
large
open
lot
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
his
home
well
thought
he
this
is
queer
how
lonely
and
still
it
seems
without
any
other
boys
around
but
i
am
going
to
fly
my
kite
anyway
so
he
tied
the
lantern
which
was
made
of
tin
punched
full
of
small
holes
to
the
tail
of
his
kite
then
he
pitched
the
kite
and
third
reader
after
several
attempts
succeeded
in
making
it
rise
up
it
went
higher
and
higher
as
ray
let
out
the
string
when
the
string
was
all
unwound
he
tied
it
to
a
fence
and
then
he
stood
and
gazed
at
his
kite
as
it
floated
high
up
in
the
air
while
ray
was
enjoying
his
sport
some
people
who
were
out
on
the
street
in

saw
a
strange
light
in

they
gathered
in

watch

in

himself

trying

get
others
into

the
youngest
whose
name
was
george
was
a
very
good
boy
george
wished
to
do
right
but
was
very
much
wanting
in
courage
the
other
boys
were
named
henry
and
james
as
they
walked
along
they
talked
as

henry
what
fun
it
would
be

throw
a

make
the

all
jump
james
you
would
jump
if

did
not
catch
you
and
whip
you
he
would
tell
your
father
and
you
would
get
a
whipping
then
and
that
would
make
you
jump
higher
than
the
scholars
i
think
henry
why
we
would
get
so
far
off
before
the

could
come
to
the
door

he
could
not
tell
who
we
are

henry
would
perhaps
have

contented

was
hungry

she
had

even
one

coiled
up

was
so

frightened

saw
the
snake
and
springing
forward
seized
it
by

and
killed
it
when
the

came
and
rubbed
his

against

put

burst
into

rover
understood
the

did

capered
about
in

all
