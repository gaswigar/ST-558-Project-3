chapter
i
one
september
afternoon
not
many
years
ago
three
men
sat
on
the
banks
of
cayuga
lake
cleaning
the
fish
they
had
caught
in
their
nets
the
previous
night
when
they
glanced
up
from
their
work
and
looked
beyond
the
southern
borders
of
the
lake
they
could
see
rising
from
the
mantle
of
forestry
the
towers
and
spires
of
cornell
university
in
ithaca
city
an
observer
would
have
noticed
a
sullen
look
of
hatred
pass
unconsciously
over
their
faces
as
their
eyes
lighted
on
the
distant
buildings
for
the
citizens
of
ithaca
were
the
enemies
of
these
squatter
fishermen
and
thought
that
their
presence
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
besmirched
its
fair
fame
not
only
did
the
summer
cottages
of
the
townfolk
that
bordered
the
lake
look
down
disdainfully
upon
their
neighbors
the
humble
shanties
of
the
squatter
fishermen
but
their
owners
did
all
they
could
to
drive
the
fishermen
out
of
the
land
none
of
the
squatters
were
allowed
to
have
the
title
of
the
property
upon
which
their
huts
stood
yet
they
clung
with
tenacity
to
their
homes
holding
them
through
the
rights
of
the
which
conceded
them
the
use
of
the
land
when
once
they
raised
a
hut
upon
it
sterner
and
sterner
the
authorities
of
ithaca
had
made
the
game
laws
until
the
fishermen
to
get
the
food
upon
which
they
lived
dared
only
draw
their
nets
by
night
in
the
winter
whilst
the
summer
residents
were
to
be
found
again
in
the
city
nature
herself
made
harder
the
lot
of
these
squatters
by
sealing
the
lake
with
thick
ice
but
they
faced
the
bitter
cold
and
frozen
surroundings
with
stolid
indifference
a
grim
silence
had
reigned
during
which
the
three
men
had
worked
with
feverish
haste
driven
on
by
the
vicissitudes
of
their
unwholesome
lives
moving
his
crooked
legs
upon
the
hot
sand
and
closing
a
red
lid
over
one
white
blind
eye
ben
letts
spoke
viciously
tess
air
that
cussed
said
he
that
she
keeps
on
saying
fishes
can
feel
when
they
gets
cut
she
air
worse
than
that
too
and
she
do
say
put
in
jake
brewer
grasping
a
large
pickerel
and
thrusting
his
blade
into
its
quivering
body
after
removing
the
scales
that
it
hurts
her
insides
to
see
the
critters
wriggle
under
the
knife
she
air
that
bad
too
ben
letts
scratched
his
head
tentatively
she
ai
had
no
bringin
up
he
resumed
again
plying
the
knife
to
his
scaly
victims
and
they
do
say
as
how
when
she
air
in
a
tantrum
she
scratch
her
dad
face
jumpin
on
his
back
like
a
cat
orn

agreed
brewer
no

humped
but

from

never

her
no
bringin
up
that
why
some
folks
has
give
their
kids

interposed
ben
letts
with
a
glance
at
the
third
man
who
was
industriously
cleaning
fish
and
had
not
yet
spoken
and
they
hai
turned
out
no
better
than
tessibel
will
at
this
the
industrious
one
turned
i
spose

muttered
i

dum
hard
to

a
girl
from
the
wrong
way

her
all
ye
will
for
an
instant
ben
letts
dropped
his
head
we
always
wondered
who
he
was
but
more
wonder
has
been
goin
on
why
ye
ai
made
no
offer
to
find
the
fellow
ai
had
no
time
said
the
desperate
cleaner
of
fish
had
to
get
bread
and
beans
to
say
nothin
of
bacon
but
why
did
ye
send
the
brat
to
the
workhouse
asked
jake
satisfied
longman
as
he
was
called
shook
his
head
i
was
satisfied
to
let
it
stay
was
all
he
answered
my
old
mammy
says
offered
ben
letts
as
how
yer
son
ezy
asked
tessibel
skinner
to
marry
him
and
as
how
she
slicked
him
in
the
face
with
a
dirty
dishrag
he
slowly
closed
the
scarlet
lids
over
his
crossed
eyes
suspending
the
pickerel
in
his
hand
the
while
tess
ai
had
no
mother
remonstrated
longman
after
a
long
silence
pausing
a
moment
in
his
bloody
work
and
allowing
his
eyes
to
rest
upon
the
magnificent
buildings
of
the
university
rearing
above
the
town
and
myry
says
that
them
what
has
ought
to
be
satisfied
just
then
a
shadow
fell
upon
the
shore
of
the
lake
near
the
fishermen
there
air
tess
now
muttered
letts
and
his
two
companions
eyed
a
figure
clad
in
rags
with
flying
hair
and
bare
dirty
feet
which
dropped
down
beside
longman
without
asking
whether
or
no
cleanin
fish
she
queried
ca

see
growled
ben
i
can
she
answered
just
wondered
if
ye
knowed
yerselves
where

yer
dad
queried
longman
smiling
as
he
caught
up
two
long
fish
depositing
one
beside
him
where
it
flopped
helplessly
about
upon
the
hot
sand
gone
to
ithacy
replied
tessibel
and
without
change
of
expression
or
color
caught
the
floundering
fish
in
her
dirty
fingers
i
air
a
hittin
the
little
devil
on
the
head
with
a
stone
said
she
and
with
a
pointed
rock
she
expertly
tapped
the
fish
three
times
behind
the
beady
eyes
and
threw
him
down
again
motionless
suppose
seein
the
fish
wrigglin

her
belly
grinned
jake
brewer
but
ben
letts
broke
in
how
be
yer
toad
tessibel
this
he
said
with
a
malevolent
smile
as
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
huge
hunk
of
tobacco
and
munched
a
generous
mouthful
therefrom
pretty
well
answered
tess
pertly
and
measuring
the
blue
water
with
her
eye
she
sent
a
flat
stone
skipping
across
it
then
with
darkening
face
she
wheeled
about
upon
the
heavy
squatter
but
air
it
any
of

business

above
the
fishermen
with
eyes
changing
to
the
deep
copper
of
her
hair
take
that
and
that
and
that
she
had
snatched
the
long
fish
from
his
fingers
and
with
swift
swirls
slapped
it
thrice
into
the
fisherman
face
turning
she
flashed
away
her
long
shadows
giving
out
the
smaller
ones
of
the
tatters

by

he
rubbed
his
face
frantically
with
the
soiled
sleeve
of
his
shirt
spitting
out
the
scales
and
blood
that
hat
lodged
between
his
teeth

skinner
pity

has
such
a
gal
letts
gave
another
wipe
at
the
scales
which
still
clung
to
his
neck
and
his
eyes
glittered
evilly
as
he
looked
in
the
direction
the
girl
had
taken
he
turned
when
longman
touched
his
arm
for
years
it
had
been
the
custom
of
the
fishermen
to
allow
the
subject
of
netting
to
remain
undiscussed
they
plied
their
trade
spent
a
term
in
prison
if
detected
and
returned
to
again
take
up
their
occupation
of
catching
and
selling
fish
ben
letts
knew
he
was
venturing
upon
dangerous
ground

daylight
he
growled
catching
the
expression
upon
his
companion
face
and
there
ai
no

in

satisfied
to

cautioned
longman
nettin

for
the
man

any
bait
out
there
he
finished
pointing
lakeward
to
a
bobbing
box
anchored
a
distance
from
the
shore
not
a
damn
bit
replied
jake
brewer
do
need
it
now
keep
the
bait
cars
a
floatin
to
blind
the
eyes
of
some
guy
that
might

they
do

a
minnie
from
a
whale
those
city
coves
do
ai
that
orn
boat
comin
under
the
shadders
of
the
trees
queried
longman
rising
to
his
feet
and
wiping
his
long
on
his
breeches
yep
it
air
him
he
added
getting
a
closer
look
at
the
approaching
boat
in
which
sat
a
big
individual
working
vigorously
away
at
the
oars
orn
skinner
was
called
the
giant
fisherman
because
even
in
his
bare
feet
he
was
seven
inches
above
every
other
man
in
the
settlement
two
enormous
humps
stood
side
by
side
on
his
shoulders
and
a
grizzled
head
lifted
and
sank
with
each
sweep
of
the
oars
glancing
around
to
direct
his
course
skinner
saw
the
men
waiting
for
him
in
front
of
jake
brewer
hut
with
a
sharp
turn
he
swung
the
boat
shoreward
and
a
few
vigorous
strokes
sent
it
grating
upon
the
sand
jumping
out
he
dragged
the
boat
to
a
safe
mooring
from
where
the
waves
could
not
beat
it
back
into
the
lake
chapter
ii
in
the
beginning
it
is
said
god
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
he
made
the
seas
and
all
that
in
them
is
with
the
myriads
of
fish
the
toads
the
snakes
and
afterward
man
then
to
grace
his
handiwork
he
created
the
heart
of
a
woman
the
loving
suffering
unteachable
heart
of
eve
the
first
tinge
of
thinking
sorrow
comes
into
a
woman
heart
at
the
age
of
fifteen
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
tessibel
sorrow
as
she
lifted
her
feet
over
the
hot
sands
and
sped
onward
tessibel
was
what
most
people
would
call
a
careless
worthless
jade
she
shamefully
neglected
her
father
but
covered
the
fact
to
him
by
the
wild
willful
worship
which
she
bestowed
upon
him
if
he
uttered
a
word
of
disapprobation
she
would
fling
herself
like
a
cat
upon
his
crooked
shoulders
and
bend
back
his
head
until
the
red
of
her
lips
met
his
the
pathos
in
her
eyes
quieting
his
qualms
as
to
the
dirt
he
had
to
go
through
to
get
into
bed
in
the
mornings
either
in
summer
or
winter
he
was
obliged
to
tumble
the
ragged
girl
from
the
roped
cot
he
had
made
for
her
when
at
last
she
had
reached
an
age
too
old
to
sleep
with
him
and
force
her
grumbling
the
while
to
eat
the
bacon
and
fish
he
had
prepared
but
he
seemed
happy
through
it
all
for
the
girl
brought
back
to
his
mind
the
slip
of
a
fishermaid
who
had
died
when
tessibel
was
born
true
there
was
more
copper
in
the
girl
hair
and
eyes
than
there
had
been
in
the
mother
more
of
the
bright
burnishing
like
that
of
a
polished
kettle
hanging
over
the
spigot
in
a
tidy
kitchen
but
tessibel
one
room
was
never
tidy
nor
had
she
a
kettle
in
one
iron
frying
pan
she
cooked
the
fish
and
bacon
while
a
small
tin
pail
held
the
water
for
the
tea
these
were
the
only
cooking
utensils
of
the
hut
tess
could
climb
to
the
top
of
the
highest
pine
tree
in
the
forest
yonder
she
could
squirm
through
the
underbrush
with
the
agility
of
a
rabbit
she
loved
every
crawling
hateful
thing
such
as
all
honest
people
despised
and
she
once
fought
with
the
son
of
an
uphill
farmer
for
robbing
a
bird
nest
making
him
give
up
the
eggs
and
restoring
them
herself
to
the
top
of
a
pine
tree
in
the
fodder
lot
of
minister
graves
according
to
the
ideas
of
all
who
knew
her
save
her
father
and
myra
longman
tessibel
was
full
of
eccentric
traits
for
who
but
tess
would
feel
the
mollygrubs
as
ben
letts
had
said
at
the
wriggling
of
the
agonized
perch
and
pickerel
as
they
flopped
painfully
upon
the
sands
or
who
but
tess
would
mind
the
squeaking
of
the
calling
for
her
own
it
was
something
of
this
mollygrub
feeling
that
hastened
her
feet
as
she
rounded
the
mud
cellar
near
her
father
hut
and
sped
back
of
the
weeping
willow
tree
hanging
in
green
fringes
over
the
cabin
she
dropped
quickly
upon
her
knees
before
a
large
log
which
in
some
former
time
the
had
dashed
to
its
place
tessibel
ran
her
red
bare
arm
into
the
hole
in
the
end
of
the
log
then
she
sat
up
and
gazed
around
he
air
gone
she
said
aloud
he
air
gone
ben
letts
has
took
him
damn
his
dirty
hide
he
ai
no
more
good
than
something
caused
her
to
close
her
lips
a
large
toad
sprang
into
her
dirty
lap
and
slipped
to
the
ground
through
the
rent
in
her
skirt
tenderly
she
took
the
reptile
in
her
fingers
for
she
loved
this
warted
monster
who
seemed
by
the
turn
of
his
head
to
reciprocate
in
some
way
the
devotion
the
girl
showered
upon
him
she
lifted
him
close
to
her
face
and
intently
searched
his
poppy
eyes
i
said
damn
his
hide
frederick
she
said
in
a
low
tone
i
thought
he
took
ye
and
ye

to

just

to
kiss

fifteen
times
and
was
askin
me
to
marry
him
i
rather

her
sentence
remained
unfinished
she
looked
up
to
see
a
tall
boy
leaning
upon
a
rake
a
boy
with
pale
gray
eyes
and
an
evil
face
his
short
hair
looked
as
if
it
had
passed
through
the
fingers
of
a
prison
barber
his
breeches
were
held
up
by
a
rope
fastened
in
the
button
holes
with
small
iron
nails
and
the
blue
blouse
which
had
been
clean
that
morning
was
now
drenched
with
perspiration
ai
ye
got
nothin
better
to
do
than
to
be
kissin
a
toad
he
expostulated
without
waiting
for
the
girl
to
greet
him
although
she
had
risen
to
her
feet
holding
fast
to
her
reptile
treasure
ai
nothin
to
you
air
it
what
i
does
as
long
as
daddy
do
care
she
retorted
and
sullenly
counted
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
long
weeping
willow
leaves
which
had
died
that
day
and
had
fallen
to
the
ground
she
gathered
each
leaf
between
her
great
bare
toe
and
its
neighbor
deftly
throwing
them
aside
as
she
counted
i
care
stolidly
said
the
boy
coming
nearer
and
ye

a
goin
to
throw
that
toad

ma

as
how
ye

if

she
says
as
how
when

sing
to
the
brat
that
yer
voice
sounds
like
an
angel
and
that
why
the
kid
sleeps
he
air
a
cryin
all
the
time
to
have
ye
sing
to
him
tess
had
expected
this
she
did
love
the
tiny
unwelcome
child
of
myra
longman
a
child
without
a
father
or
a
place
in
the
world
tess
loved
the
babe
because
there
was
an
expression
in
its
eyes
that
she
had
once
seen
in
a
wounded
baby
bird
a
pitiful
unborn
expression
which
would
go
with
the
brat
to
its
grave
she
stooped
down
and
placed
the
toad
again
in
his
hole
shoving
him
deep
down
into
his
cavity
for
the
sun
was
going
down
and
frederick
would
sleep
as
long
as
there
were
no
flies
about
the
boy
spoke
again
mammy
says
as
how
if
ye
do
stop
runnin
wild
ye
be
worse
than
myry
with
another
suddenly
the
clenched
fist
of
the
girl
flew
up
and
struck
the
fisherman
with
a
swiftness
and
force
that
took
him
from
his
feet
tessibel
was
standing
over
him
rigidly
i
hates
ye
i
hates
ye
i
ruther

or
a

as
ugly
as

than
you
ezry
longman
does
yer
hear
does
yer
hear
the
lumbering
body
raised
itself
from
the
ground
the
squint
eyes
were
almost
closed
only
a
glint
of
the
gray
ring
that
surrounded
the
pupil
showing
between
the
lids
ye
think
that
ye
can
hide
from

what

burst
out

toad
after

of

honest
rakin
of
hay
nor
catchin
a
fish
only
by

ye
loves
that
feller
that
what
ye
does
bewilderment
leapt
alive
in
the
girl
brown
eyes
the
shade
deepened
almost
to
black
as
the
thought
the
boy
had
planted
in
the
sensitive
mind
took
root
and
grew
then
the
dirty
young
face
flooded
with
crimson
which
tinted
the
rounded
neck
and
colored
the
low
forehead
and
tess
dropped
down
beside
the
log
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
the
fisherman
was
so
surprised
that
he
uttered
not
a
word
while
the
wild
storm
broke
over
the
girl
heart
dying
away
in
a
smothered
moan
without
a
glance
at
the
boy
she
lifted
herself
slowly
from
the
earth
and
walking
erect
and
tall
into
her
father
hut
closed
the
door
with
a
bang
she
slipped
the
leather
fastening
into
its
place
and
dazedly
adjusted
the
iron
peg
in
the
opening
to
hold
it
tessibel
heart
had
manifested
its
hitherto
unknown
burden
and
the
woman
lived
amid
the
dirt
and
squalor
of
the
fisherman
cabin
tessibel
peremptory
leaving
and
the
hauteur
in
her
face
were
so
foreign
to
her
that
ezra
longman
did
not
dare
follow
he
leaned
upon
his
rake
looking
after
her
his
gray
eyes
gathered
into
an
incomprehensive
squint
had
tess
again
cuffed
his
ears
he
would
have
been
secretly
delighted
but
this
manner
so
unlike
her
seemed
to
take
her
as
far
above
him
as
that
flock
of
black
crows
yonder
flying
to
the
forest
to
find
shelter
for
the
night
tessibel
he
called
helplessly
under
his
breath
but
tessibel
did
not
hear
he
limped
away
not
knowing
that
she
had
passed
as
effectually
out
of
his
life
as
if
she
had
not
dwelt
in
the
rickety
cabin
on
his
right
chapter
iii
ben
letts
rose
to
his
feet
after
cleaning
his
in
the
water
and
took
the
same
path
around
the
mud
cellar
which
tessibel
had
taken
the
cabin
door
was
closed
tess
nowhere
in
sight
ben
had
intended
ben
did
know
just
what
his
intentions
were
he
stopped
short
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
frederick
log
it
took
a
long
time
for
a
thought
to
be
born
in
the
dense
brain
of
the
fisherman
but
one
was
there
for
the
cross
eyes
opened
and
the
red
tongue
licked
greedily
at
the
thick
chops
like
that
of
a
wolf
when
he
comes
upon
prey
for
which
he
does
not
have
to
fight
letts
looked
sneakily
at
the
hut
window
where
hung
the
remnants
of
a
ragged
curtain
all
was
quiet
he
quickly
ran
his
long
arm
into
the
opening
of
the
log
and
with
a
snap
of
his
teeth
drew
out
the
toad
holding
the
reptile
in
his
hand
he
slunk
behind
the
willow
tree
and
stood
an
instant
in
abstract
hesitation
suddenly
his
fiendish
face
became
flooded
with
the
exultation
of
a
plan
fully
matured
he
let
the
toad
fall
to
the
ground
needing
both
hands
to
draw
the
blade
of
his
frederick
hopped
vigorously
along
in
the
direction
of
his
log
but
ben
gorged
with
the
instincts
of
an
inquisitor
snatched
him
up
as
he
was
about
to
escape
after
divesting
frederick
of
all
the
ornaments
which
nature
had
given
him
the
man
allowed
him
to
hop
about
grinning
as
he
watched
the
rapid
leaps
of
the
toad
frederick
had
forgotten
the
path
to
his
log
he
could
only
turn
around
and
around
as
if
he
had
been
born
to
radiate
in
a
circle
ben
could
have
watched
this
tumbling
toad
all
night
so
great
was
his
joy
at
the
sight
but
it
was
getting
dark
and
soon
the
call
would
come
for
the
fishermen
to
gather
for
the
netting
and
he
would
be
expected
to
go
taking
the
toad
gingerly
up
from
the
earth
he
returned
it
to
the
hole
in
the
log
and
with
but
a
hasty
glance
at
the
dirty
curtain
which
hung
limp
and
ugly
at
the
cabin
window
sneaked
away
after
leaving
ezra
longman
tessibel
stood
in
the
cabin
for
one
single
moment
with
the
terrible
thought
which
the
boy
had
planted
there
burning
in
her
brain
she
had
but
a
few
times
seen
the
minister
son
who
lived
in
the
big
house
on
the
hill
and
not
even
to
herself
had
she
mentioned
that
he
was
her
ideal
of
manhood
he
was
as
far
above
her
as
the
learned
minister
was
above
her
own
squatter
father
her
heart
seemed
to
almost
stop
beating
as
she
sprang
headlong
into
daddy
bed
and
covered
herself
with
the
ragged
blanket
only
when
she
heard
her
father
pounding
at
the
door
did
she
lift
her
head
she
jumped
swiftly
from
the
bed
to
let
him
in
no
thought
of
supper
for
him
had
entered
her
mind
he
looked
his
hunger
as
he
noted
the
absence
of
a
fire
and
spoke
rather
mournfully
but
tess
cut
him
short
the
lithe
young
form
bounded
squarely
upon
the
of
the
fisherman
she
drew
back
his
shaggy
head
her
bright
wide
eyes
shining
into
skinner
and
a
low
voice
deepened
by
the
first
arousal
of
womanly
emotion
which
had
ever
come
knowingly
into
the
young
life
was
murmuring
to
him
i
loves
ye
daddy
i
do
what
does
ye
care
for
supper
when
i
loves
ye
like
this
daddy

the
girl
softly
square
where

square
on
the
bill
the
girl
got
the
caress
and
then
eagerly
hastened
to
fry
the
inevitable
fish
i
air
coming
after
ye
to
longman
when
the
nettin
over
broke
in
orn
skinner
presently
his

full
of
bread
and
fish

she
rose
quickly
and
came
to
his

she
began
twisting
his
big
head
so
her
eyes
met
his
ca

ai

orn
skinner
dreaded
the
wheedling
tone
in
tessibel
voice
and
the
pleading
in
the
eyes
so
like
her
mother
he
dropped
his
gaze
upon
his
plate
and
slowly
shook
his
head
nope
tess
ye

goin
to
longman
do
now
there
be
a
kiss
sit
down
and
eat
that
air
a
good
brat
the
last
ejaculation
was
brought
forth
by
tess
herself
she
had
turned
back
to
her
place
at
the
table
and
had
complacently
begun
to
eat
the
crisp
brown
fish
and
ye
ai
to
stay
on
the
ragged
rocks
nuther
tess
cautioned
skinner
rising
from
the
table
ye
be
a
good
tess
scoot
along
now
the
fisherman
moved
lumberingly
to
the
water
edge
pushing
his
boat
into
the
lake
and
stepped
in
thrusting
his
powerful
head
down
between
his
shoulders
he
pulled
lazily
away
at
the
oars
until
he
lost
sight
of
the
shore
on
which
stood
the
small
silent
figure
in
the
fast
gathering
gloom
tess
did
not
fancy
netting
nights
she
always
feared
that
something
might
happen
to
her
father
but
she
knew
too
that
they
could
not
live
even
meagerly
through
the
long
winter
unless
the
nets
were
used
so
this
night
after
she
had
received
many
kisses
square
on
the
bill
she
watched
her
father
bent
shoulders
rising
and
falling
with
the
motion
of
the
oars
as
long
as
she
could
see
him
and
turning
scudded
through
the
underbrush
which
grew
in
profusion
near
the
forest
up
to
the
rugged
rocks
toward
the
longmans
hut
she
slid
down
beside
a
large
stone
as
she
heard
the
lapping
of
oars
below
her
on
the
lake
and
knew
that
satisfied
longman
and
his
son
ezra
were
going
to
join
the
others
at
jake
brewer
shanty
she
was
alone
under
the
heavens
alone
with
the
eagles
and
sleepy
twittering
birds
she
could
think
of
what
had
been
forced
upon
her
that
day
she
bitterly
regretted
the
tears
shed
before
ezra
and
she
must
never
never
again
look
at
the
student
graves
she
felt
that
to
see
his
face
even
from
a
distance
would
cause
her
to
drop
dead
before
him
every
muscle
tingled
and
her
eyes
burned
with
unshed
tears
she
had
never
dared
to
speak
even
to
his
sister
the
pretty
teola
graves
who
fluttered
about
with
pink
ribbons
among
her
curls
and
wore
high
heels
on
her
shoes
suddenly
tess
opened
her
lips
and
sent
ringing
over
the
lake
in
glorious
tones
of
pathos
the
hymn
she
loved
best
rescue
the
perishin
care
for
the
dyin
tessibel
knew
what
it
meant
to
almost
perish
from
the
cold
she
had
felt
the
cruel
blasts
of
the
winter
winds
upon
her
chilblained
feet
for
she
had
never
known
the
luxury
of
shoes
she
had
also
seen
the
dying
and
understood
what
it
meant
to
turn
a
longing
face
toward
heaven
with
a
burning
desire
to
know
what
was
beyond
such
a
voice
as
tessibel
had
never
been
heard
upon
cayuga
lake
ben
letts
said
it
put
him
in
mind
of
listening
to
the
wild
cry
of
a
lost
soul
while
myra
longman
could
hear
only
the
songs
of
angels
in
the
exquisite
tones
which
fell
pure
and
sweet
from
the
red
lips
tess
knew
nothing
of
breath
power
nothing
of
trained
trilling
tones
but
nature
had
given
her
both
and
like
the
birds
of
the
air
she
used
them
the
girl
had
not
moved
from
beside
the
stone
near
which
she
had
fallen
the
night
was
so
strange
so
different
from
any
night
tessibel
had
ever
known
her
whole
idea
of
life
had
been
altered
that
day
by
the
word
of
a
fisherman
and
the
woman
heart
grew
larger
and
larger
until
the
squatter
girl
felt
that
it
was
going
to
burst
something
crawled
over
her
bare
foot
and
brought
her
to
her
senses
leaning
over
she
drew
to
her
lap
a
long
slimy
lizard
which
she
held
caressingly
in
her
fingers
she
lifted
him
high
up
and
looked
at
him
through
the
moonlight
green
she
said
slowly
ai
he
a
dandy
but
i
do
dare
carry
him
even
a
little
way
for
fear
he
lose
his
house
i
bet
he
has
a
pile
of
green
babies
dropping
the
lizard
beside
the
rock
she
sped
away
just
before
reaching
the
longman
cabin
she
raised
her
voice
and
sang
again
rescue
the
perishin
care
for
the
dyin
some
one
opened
the
door
and
she
bounded
in
glad

the
wee
boy
stopped
his
tears
immediately
his
back
grew
limp
and
his
fists
opened
out
as
tessibel
began
to
sing
this
time
the
song
was
did
ye
ever
go
into

irishman
shanty
the
child

asleep
and

box

myra

ezra
then
had
told
his
mother
of
the
student
a
frown
deepened
on
the
girl
brow
she
hated
ezra
longman
with
an
inward
fury
for
what
he
had
said
that
day
ye
might
have
a
yerself
tessibel
warned
longman
as
she
went
to
bed
clambering
up
the
long
ladder
to
the
loft
leaving
the
girls
alone
chapter
iv
outside
the
longman
hut
the
wind
had
quickened
its
pace
up
the
dark
lake
but
inside
there
was
no
sound
save
the
small
snore
of
the
infant
do

and
she
shivered
for
she
knew
that
she
had
lied
to
tess
this
was
the
first
time
myra
had
mentioned
her
trouble
that
is
in
just
that
confidential
manner
tessibel
came
closer
had
it
not
been
a
mystery
since
the
coming
of
the
brat
who
had
been
responsible
for
his
tiny
life
it
air
some
un
what
ye
knows
too
tessibel
myra
said
shifting
her
eyes
from
her
companion
face
to
the
box
where
the
infant
lay
but
tess
did
not
ask
the
name
suddenly
myra
leaned
over
and
whispered
something
in
the
other
girl
ear
and
tessibel
started
as
if
she
had
been
stung
by
an
adder
nope
it
ai
him
she
cried
starting
up
he
air
bad
but
not
so
bad
as
that
it
were
him
replied
myra
and
he
beat
me
that
night
on
the
ragged
rocks
and
that
air
what
broke
my
arm
ye
remember
tessibel
nodded
she
had
heard
a
secret
that
not
even
myra
mother
knew
she
felt
intuitively
that
myra
intended
her
to
keep
silent
she
did
not
dare
to
speak
again
fearing
the
woman
above
was
not
asleep
but
myra
with
less
fear
resumed
no
hopin
the
brat
will
live
and
if
he
does
he
get
his
eatin
alright
what
brats
do
but
tessibel
i
telled
ye
this
to
keep
ye
away
from
the
ragged
rocks
for
there
air
no
tellin
what
will
happen
to
ye
and
yer
that
pretty
tessibel
stared
blankly
pretty
pretty
she
gasped
stumbling
over
the
words
ye
say
pretty
me
pretty
myra
longman
as
if
ye
did
know
it
scoffed
myra
but
yer
face
air
allers
so
dum
dirty
that
ye
ca
see
nothin
but
yer
eyes
and
yer
matty
old
hair
it
air
a
shame
to
live
like
ye
do
tessibel
sat
up
this
was
her
first
ambitious
moment
never
had
lips
said
such
things
to
her
and
she
had
always
known
myra
longman
rising
from
the
chair
she
disappeared
into
the
outer
room
and
myra
could
hear
the
splashing
of
water
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
as
tessibel
stood
first
on
one
and
then
the
other
washing
her
dirty
face
she
mopped
the
long
red
hair
in
and
out
of
the
and
myra
was
not
prepared
for
the
vision
which
tessibel
made
in
her
new
state
of
cleanliness
the
impetus
of
being
by
an
effort
of
her
own
had
blackened
the
copper
colored
eyes
the
long
fringed
lashes
dripped
with
pearls
of
water
while
the
skin
had
reddened
from
the
vigorous
rubbing
but
it
was
very
very
clean
i
wants
yer
comb
myry
longman
said
tessibel
slowly
shaking
herself
like
a
big
dog
myra
hesitated
ye
got
too
much
dirt
in
your
hair
yet
said
she
but
if
ye
take
care
of
yer
mop
i
be
givin
ye
a
comb
to
yourself
tess
did
not
deny
the
accusation
of
her
filth
she
took
the
comb
and
drew
it
through
the
wet
locks
myra
was
regarding
her
critically
tessibel
was
beautiful
in
the
last
year
ezra
sister
had
seen
the
change
coming
the
complexion
had
whitened
under
the
perpetual
dirt
and
the
long
eyes
had
gathered
an
expression
of
knowledge
while
their
color
changed
from
light
to
dark
with
passing
emotions
myra
bent
her
brows
as
she
examined
tessibel
closer
the
skin
was
clean
and
shone
with
the
glossiness
of
much
soap
the
low
brow
was
covered
with
small
wet
ringlets
which
turned
and
twisted
here
and
there
in
luxurious
confusion
over
the
shoulders
hidden
by
a
soiled
calico
blouse
the
copper
colored
mass
hung
in
dripping
waves
you
air
pretty
said
myra
slowly
but
ye
air
so
dum
dirty
no
one
can
ever
see
it
why
ai
you
washed
up
like
that
every
day
never
knowed
how
before
did
see
nothin
to
keep
clean
in
my
face
as
tessibel
spoke
she
stood
before
the
glass
looking
at
her
own
image
spying
upon
the
prettiness
which
myra
said
was
there
this
hair
air
like
red
snakes
she
gasped
passionately
just
like
the
snakes
that
eats
the
little
birds
in
the
spring
in
the
sun
their
backs
air
red
like
this
and
this
and
this
she
was
angrily
tearing
at
the
beautiful
tightly
curled
ringlets
with
but
one
thought
dominating
her
brain
students
never
liked
red
haired
girls
with
eyes
which
looked
like
copper
do
ordered
myra
catching
the
rough
hands
as
they
pulled
at
the
profusion
of
redness
do
ye
air
tearin
it
out
by
the
roots
and
it
looks
like
like
the
sun
when
it
air
goin
down
in
one
ball
of
fire
it
air
beautiful
beautiful
beautiful
tessibel
caught
her
breath
and
looked
at
myra
with
a
yellowish
glint
born
of
a
new
emotion
in
her
eyes
was
the
mother
making
fun
of
her
all
her
short
life
had
this
been
portion
ben
letts
had
followed
her
along
the
ragged
rocks
over
which
her
bare
feet
flew
with
the
swiftness
of
eagle
wings
and
when
he
found
she
could
not
be
induced
to
stop
he
would
shout
in
defiance
brick
top
red
head
and
such
names
that
went
deep
into
the
sensitive
little
heart
when
she
reached
home
she
would
tear
at
the
curls
and
cut
them
fiercely
with
the
knife
which
her
father
used
to
skin
his
fish
and
large
eels
yet
nature
would
send
more
and
more
of
the
burnished
gold
to
adorn
tessibel
head
and
not
until
had
she
ever
heard
one
word
in
praise
of
it
the
reformation
had
begun
tessibel
went
again
to
the
soap
and
water
and
myra
looking
through
the
crack
of
the
door
saw
tess
dragging
madly
at
her
hair
sopping
it
first
in
the
pan
and
then
in
the
deep
bucket
which
ezra
used
to
give
the
pig
their
swill
once
myra
saw
the
mass
of
gold
disappear
into
the
pail
and
when
tessibel
came
again
to
view
she
was
sputtering
coughing
and
blowing
the
cold
water
from
her
nose
and
mouth
wo
be
much
left
if
ye
keeps
on
at
yer
hair
that
way
called
myra
grimly
but
the
soap
air
good
for
cleanin
it
there
air
other
days
and
nights
too
she
went
on
sarcastically
and
it
air
almost
midnight
yer
daddy
be
here
soon
wonder
if
the
game
warden
air
out
as
if
in
answer
to
her
question
they
heard
the
dipping
of
oars
and
a
little
later
a
boat
was
dragged
to
its
moorings
on
the
shore
satisfied
longman
entered
with
his
son
and
ben
letts
daddy
were
tired
and
did
come
for
me
asked
tessibel
your
daddy
did
come
child
replied
the
elder
longman
whilst
ben
letts
stood
with
his
squint
eyes
lowered
he
had
an
exquisite
feeling
within
him
longing
for
the
sight
of
the
girl
after
she
had
heard
their
news
i
air
goin
home
to
daddy
i
ai
afeared
to
go
home
alone
she
said
stoutly
and
defiantly
for
ben
letts
made
a
move
to
accompany
her
i
ai
afeared
of
the
night
things
nor
nothin
that
crawls
nor
flies
ye
knows
i
ai
afeared
myra
ye
ai
goin
home
tessibel
said
long
man
for
yer
father
ai
there
at
first
tessibel
did
comprehend
she
thought
of
the
care
which
was
taken
to
keep
the
fish
fresh
for
the
market
daddy
was
putting
the
pickerel
and
numerous
eels
in
the
blind
fish
cars
until
they
could
be
cleaned
she
looked
into
satisfied
longman
face
air
he
a
carin
for
the
fish
longman
shook
his
head
in
the
negative
where
air
he
then
tessibel
voice
was
sharp
and
penetrating
it
awoke
longman
upstairs
and
the
infant
in
the
box
beside
the
rope
cot
he
air
gone
to
prison
put
in
ezra
opening
and
shutting
his
eyes
and
licking
his
thick
lips
with
his
red
tongue
he
air
where
ye
wo
see
him
to
scratch
his
face
when
ye
goes
into
a
tantrum
he
air
in
prison
the
bronze
eyes
widened
and
lengthened
till
the
very
fear
in
them
startled
her
companions
the
tall
slight
figure
with
its
weight
of
rags
swayed
to
the
hut
floor
the
clean
shining
face
gathered
into
a
painful
pucker
while
the
two
fists
which
had
fought
many
a
hard
battle
clenched
until
the
nails
entered
the
calloused
skin
under
each
finger
not
one
word
came
from
the
tightened
white
lips
the
dumb
agony
was
worse
than
a
child
frantic
scream
of
fear
somehow
ben
mind
went
back
to
the
toad
when
it
also
had
borne
its
misery
dumbly
satisfied
longman
stooping
down
grasped
the
girl
and
stood
her
on
her
feet
no
one
had
ever
seen
tess
like
this
ben
leered
the
sides
of
his
fat
cheeks
protruding
in
the
joyful
emotion
he
felt
at
suffering
he
killed
the
gamekeeper
he
grinned
leaning
back
against
the
wall
he
air
where
ye
wo
hurt
him
now
the
tortured
tess
could
bear
no
more
she
had
striven
to
be
brave
when
she
thought
of
daddy
in
the
small
cell
which
she
had
heard
many
times
vividly
described
she
had
thought
vaguely
of
months
perhaps
a
whole
year
without
him
but
ben
words
made
her
father
a
murderer
and
murderers
went
away
sometimes
never
to
return
her
daddy
and
ezra
had
said
that
she
could
never
scratch
his
face
again
she
hurt
daddy
did
every
one
in
the
settlement
think
that
she
sank
down
beside
father
and
winding
her
arms
about
his
legs
implored
him
to
say
that
it
was
only
ben
and
ezra
fun
it
air
fun
only
fun
satisfied
ai
it
she
pleaded
for
daddy
poor
old
daddy
never
killed
no
man
we
all
says
as
how
it
were
a
mistake
replied
longman
ben
says
the
gun
went
off
in
yer
daddy
hands
and
the
warden
dropped
and
the
other
gamekeeper
took
yer
daddy
away
at
the
point
of
his
pistol
i
were
at
the
north
reel
and
could
save
him
nohow
tessibel
understood
it
was
all
plain
now
she
loosened
her
arms
and
painfully
raised
herself
the
shock
had
hurt
her
flesh
and
made
her
sore
and
lame
she
started
dazedly
toward
the
door
satisfied
trying
to
stop
her
flight
but
the
strong
young
body
mad
with
grief
and
newly
found
despair
slipped
through
the
friendly
fingers
and
the
night
tessibel
night
gathered
her
into
its
arms
till
she
was
lost
in
the
long
shadows
of
the
pine
forest
chapter
v
a
night
owl
hooted
in
tessibel
ear
as
she
ran
a
bat
whirled
into
her
face
then
took
himself
off
over
the
shadowy
rocks
which
cut
and
bruised
her
feet
tessibel
flew
daddy
was
home
in
the
shanty
he
was
in
his
bed
tired
from
hauling
his
nets
she
remembered
ezra
had
grinned
at
her
as
with
one
hasty
look
she
had
fixed
his
face
in
her
mind
he
had
lied
to
her
daddy
was
in
the
hut
and
if
he
were
up
waiting
for
her
there
passed
through
small
mind
the
thought
of
how
joyfully
she
would
hop
to
the
bowed
shoulders
and
she
longed
for
the
kisses
she
knew
would
be
hers
she
halted
before
the
dark
hut
and
waited
insects
whizzed
about
her
ears
as
though
they
little
feared
her
the
long
branches
of
the
weeping
willow
dragged
themselves
across
the
tin
roof
with
a
ghostly
sound
this
was
tessibel
night
of
heart
experiences
her
first
day
and
her
first
night
oh
to
go
back
to
yesterday
with
the
hidden
fear
of
the
student
sleeping
soundly
in
her
breast
and
a
daddy
a
dear
stooping
old
daddy
she
slipped
open
the
shanty
door
lighted
a
candle
and
looked
around
the
frying
pan
lay
bottom
up
on
the
floor
where
she
had
dropped
it
the
tea
pail
was
on
the
table
a
cut
loaf
of
bread
lay
beside
it
covered
with
a
host
of
small
red
ants
all
this
was
familiar
to
tess
she
kicked
the
pan
from
her
path
with
her
bare
foot
and
sat
down
on
the
three
legged
stool
which
her
father
used
at
his
meals
portions
of
fish
and
plenty
of
bones
were
spread
about
upon
the
floor
but
the
littered
shanty
did
not
distress
her
newly
found
notions
of
cleanliness
daddy
might
go
away
to
the
black
place
where
they
had
taken
the
canadian
indian
who
had
killed
his
squaw
tess
remembered
hearing
how
he
had
been
carried
to
prison
twelve
men
had
found
him
guilty
of
the
crime
and
at
last
tessibel
started
up
with
a
groan
the
canadian
indian
had
been
carried
to
the
place
where
the
rope
was
daddy
skinner
and
the
canadian
indian
tess
dared
think
no
longer
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
herself
in
the
cracked
mirror
which
skinner
used
when
he
plied
the
pinchers
to
his
beard
and
her
wild
eyed
bronzeness
caused
her
to
give
a
startled
ejaculation
daddy
was
gone
and
frederick
the
toad
was
her
all
the
thought
of
the
reptile
she
loved
brought
her
quickly
to
her
feet
frederick
should
sleep
in
the
shanty
while
daddy
was
away
tessibel
halted
apprehensively
in
the
open
doorway
from
the
shore
willows
hoot
owls
pierced
the
inky
night
with
their
sonorous
cries
while
in
throaty
discord
a
million
marsh
frogs
bellowed
farewell
to
summer
the
lake
shores
caught
the
unceasing
waves
in
eternal
laps
the
rhythm
soothing
the
ears
of
the
squatter
girl
as
her
unfathomable
gaze
pierced
the
midnight
gloom
but
the
weight
of
sorrow
and
longing
on
the
strong
nature
untried
by
emotion
strangled
the
rising
fear
and
tessibel
advanced
a
step
to
the
pebbly
path
once
outside
in
the
darkness
she
lifted
her
voice
and
repeated
as
of
yore
rescue
the
care
for
the
dyin
never
before
had
the
words
roused
her
as
now
daddy
skinner
needed
that
refrain
she
darted
around
the
corner
of
the
mud
cellar
and
shoving
her
hand
into
the
familiar
hole
in
the
log
tessibel
drew
frederick
quickly
out
she
dropped
him
into
her
blouse
and
retraced
her
steps
to
the
shanty
she
could
never
be
lonely
and
quite
without
hope
if
frederick
were
with
her
had
she
loved
him
for
four
long
months
and
daily
fed
him
his
portion
of
flies
she
took
him
from
her
bosom
where
many
times
he
had
sunk
into
toad
and
without
looking
at
him
placed
him
on
the
floor
it
air
a
bad
night
for
us
frederick
she
said
out
loud
it
air
but
you
not
sleep
in
the
log
but
in
daddy
bed
and
i
just
pretend
ye
air
daddy
and
when
ye
croak
with
the
daylight
ye
can
have
all
the
flies
lightin
on
the
sugar
and
then
we
air
goin
after
daddy
and
bring
him
home
to
the
shanty
frederick
tessibel
turned
her
head
and
glanced
at
frederick
generally
when
she
spoke
he
would
give
an
answering
grunt
she
gazed
at
him
but
dared
not
venture
closer
had
she
lost
her
mind
like
jake
brewer
sister
when
they
brought
home
the
body
of
her
drowned
husband
tessibel
lighted
another
candle
and
then
the
third
the
match
burned
low
between
her
fingers
as
she
touched
it
to
the
fourth
once
more
she
looked
upon
the
horrid
sight
terror
striving
and
struggling
for
some
outlet
in
her
torn
young
soul
frederick
blinked
a
pair
of
beady
eyes
filmed
with
death
he
moved
a
mutilated
body
with
painful
jerks
but
there
was
nothing
to
show
the
girl
that
he
felt
her
presence
the
silent
awful
pulsating
of
the
toad
manifested
its
dumb
suffering
a
candle
flickered
as
she
sought
to
solve
the
problem
the
night
wind
flapped
the
dirty
curtain
and
tessibel
turned
her
head
slowly
toward
it
a
bird
cry
from
somewhere
in
the
weeping
willow
came
in
through
the
window
with
silent
intensity
she
dragged
her
body
slowly
across
the
floor
toward
the
flattened
reptile
above
him
she
squatted
the
gorgeous
hair
sweeping
the
filth
strewn
floor
tess
could
mark
the
places
where
the
beloved
warts
had
been
she
knew
how
many
there
were
even
to
the
tiny
ones
with
the
halting
precision
of
the
ignorant
she
had
counted
them
singly
every
day
but
the
severest
heart
wrench
of
all
was
to
come
to
tess
the
great
squat
hind
legs
which
had
been
her
pride
when
frederick
jumped
through
her
rounded
arms
curled
to
make
a
hoop
were
gone
and
the
movements
of
frederick
body
left
a
tiny
trail
of
dark
blood
upon
the
shanty
floor
she
could
touch
that
dying
thing
in
her
vehement
desire
to
relieve
him
of
his
pain
she
burst
into
song
which
went
upward
and
outward
ringing
over
the
lake
returning
again
only
to
be
sent
further
and
further
into
the
heavens
rescue
the
care
for
the
dyin
this
was
all
tessibel
knew
of
the
hymn
over
and
over
she
sang
it
fearfully
watching
the
toad
move
grotesquely
in
the
candlelight
time
after
time
the
blinking
eyes
closed
and
flew
open
again
and
again
tessibel
sent
her
importunate
prayer
into
the
heart
of
the
great
unknown
frederick
gave
a
great
deep
sob
his
fat
sides
lifted
and
fell
twice
and
as
the
petitionate
lips
of
the
girl
sent
the
song
once
more
into
the
night
he
flopped
over
on
his
back
straightened
out
the
little
wounded
stumps
and
died
daddy
skinner
the
canadian
indian
and
frederick
tess
separate
the
three
the
prayerful
mood
died
with
the
toad
she
opened
her
lips
and
uttered
two
great
piercing
shrieks
which
sounded
and
resounded
through
the
rafters
of
the
shanty
out
into
the
darkness
and
up
to
the
ragged
rocks
it
was
the
cry
of
a
wounded
human
thing
amounting
to
but
little
in
the
great
whirling
universe
the
dying
of
the
scream
brought
words
from
her
lips
daddy
skinner
daddy
skinner
then
twice
in
equally
shrill
longing
resounded
the
name
of
her
dead
friend
frederick
aw
aw
frederick
both
cries
followed
the
prayer
echoing
their
agony
out
through
the
window
the
flapping
curtain
with
its
tatters
offering
no
impediment
for
its
outgoing
suddenly
tessibel
staggered
to
her
feet
for
back
to
her
through
the
window
from
somewhere
near
the
mud
cellar
came
an
answering
voice
and
vibrant
what
what
frederick
the
student
stood
in
the
door
of
the
dirty
shanty
looking
upon
an
unkempt
girl
and
a
great
squat
dead
wartless
toad
chapter
vi
you
called
me
a
silence
you
called
me
the
student
repeated
the
words
twice
so
satisfied
was
he
that
his
name
had
been
called
out
in
tones
of
great
insistence
tessibel
was
deaf
to
his
words
his
presence
had
filled
her
completely
leaning
against
the
post
of
daddy
bed
she
glued
her
eyes
upon
the
student
face
the
fringed
lids
sprung
to
their
fullest
capacity
the
extreme
fascination
in
her
gaze
held
the
boy
spellbound
then
the
eyelids
quivered
and
it
was
over
frederick
glanced
hurriedly
about
the
room
the
untidiness
of
it
all
striking
his
sensitiveness
he
noted
the
pungent
smell
of
fried
fish
mixed
with
inferior
grease
the
bread
the
confusion
of
ragged
and
lastly
of
all
the
other
frederick
tessibel
gasped
as
the
newcomer
looked
longest
upon
her
dead
she
thought
she
saw
him
shiver
as
he
stepped
back
a
little
this
brought
her
grief
vividly
back
to
her
the
pain
as
acute
and
sharp
as
the
knife
which
had
ended
the
life
of
frederick
entered
her
already
riven
soul
the
instant
before
a
mingled
sensation
of
shame
and
embarrassment
had
swept
over
her
because
of
the
appearance
of
the
hut
and
her
own
bare
legs
and
feet
but
the
helpless
dead
sent
even
that
from
her
he
air
gone
she
said
chokingly
coming
forward
with
a
totter
disgust
rested
paramount
upon
the
student
face
surprise
followed
this
as
tessibel
threw
herself
in
limp
unconcern
beside
the
other
frederick
and
gathered
the
stiffened
toad
into
her
arms
she
rocked
to
and
fro
as
a
mother
might
who
had
suddenly
discovered
that
the
great
white
mystery
had
robbed
her
of
her
child
tessibel
maternal
instinct
was
being
strongly
developed
in
her
agony
of
the
hour
and
the
identity
of
frederick
the
student
was
lost
in
frederick
the
toad
her
one
little
friend
to
whom
she
had
told
all
her
sorrows
and
had
been
ruthlessly
torn
from
her
already
she
could
feel
the
short
front
legs
growing
stiff
and
the
throat
which
had
so
often
grunted
for
its
supper
was
falling
into
a
curve
the
great
mutilated
back
which
had
lifted
and
then
receded
with
every
breath
was
still
and
frederick
lay
like
the
lump
of
clay
that
he
was
in
the
arms
of
his
foster
mother
tessibel
child
by
adoption
would
never
again
gather
into
his
slit
of
a
mouth
the
flies
which
favored
the
sugar
then
tess
still
clasping
her
dead
friend
lifted
her
head
a
stranger
had
intruded
upon
her
grief
she
gathered
her
bruised
sore
feet
under
the
short
ragged
girl
skirt
and
lifted
a
woman
soulful
face
toward
the
student
what
do
ye
want
she
asked
sullenly
you
called
me
it
were
him
i
wanted
she
said
hysterically
hugging
her
little
dead
burden
the
toad
yep
he
were
all
i
had
him
and
daddy
and
daddy
skinner
air
gone
too
then
tessibel
forgot
the
student
and
the
forlorn
red
head
with
its
burden
of
curls
lay
relaxed
upon
the
lifeless
frederick
while
the
wept
in
abject
loneliness
impetuously
the
second
frederick
stepped
forward
the
movement
closing
the
door
with
a
bang
and
causing
the
candles
to
lift
their
smothered
flames
and
flicker
smokily
the
wind
shrieked
through
the
broken
window
and
the
cracks
between
the
shanty
boards
a
storm
played
with
the
water
casting
its
grayness
into
white
capped
rollers
which
beat
upon
the
shore
like
the
restless
spirits
of
an
ocean
still
the
girl
wept
on
wept
for
frederick
for
daddy
and
once
a
shuddering
thought
went
through
her
mind
of
the
canadian
indian
he
killed
the
gamekeeper
ezy
says
daddy
skinner
she
whimpered
suddenly
she
sat
up
her
small
round
face
puckered
into
such
lines
of
pain
that
the
student
turned
his
head
away
feeling
dangerously
near
tears
he
had
always
been
taught
by
his
father
and
by
his
mother
who
feared
contagion
that
of
all
people
in
the
world
the
squatters
must
be
most
avoided
they
had
no
hearts
they
killed
men
and
broke
the
laws
simply
for
their
own
gain
but
here
was
a
girl
magnetically
drawing
him
toward
her
dirty
yes
and
barefooted
and
untaught
but
suffering
and
such
suffering
frederick
graves
like
his
father
would
teach
the
gospel
of
christ
of
peace
and
to
all
mankind
but
the
deep
burnishing
of
the
beautiful
hair
as
it
swept
the
floor
in
red
curls
had
much
to
do
with
frederick
sympathy
for
he
looked
upon
eve
in
her
beauty
and
pitied
your
father
is
orn
skinner
who
shot
the
gamekeeper
he
asked
presently
tess
nodded
still
looking
fearfully
into
his
face
he
was
disobeying
the
law
replied
frederick
gravely
again
she
nodded
for
tess
had
no
spirit
to
thwart
an
argument
at
that
moment
people
who
disobey
the
law
went
on
the
student
in
his
youthful
righteousness
take
their
life
in
their
hands
and
other
people
too
do
you
think
that
the
woman
left
without
her
husband
the
gamekeeper
wife
is
weeping
for
him
it
was
a
new
thought
for
tess
but
she
would
not
harbor
it
it
seem
quite
just
to
daddy
she
drew
down
the
red
lips
at
the
corners
and
helplessly
clung
closer
and
closer
to
the
toad
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
the
student
you
lived
here
with
your
father
but
you
ca
stay
here
alone
it
air
my
home
she
said
distrustfully
and
i
stays
here
and
hangs
to
this
here
shanty
till
daddy
comes
back
aw
he
air
comin
back
he
he
wo
go
to
that
place
she
closed
her
lips
fearing
to
utter
the
thought
frederick
shook
his
head
poor
child
he
said
with
a
fatherly
air
it
is
a
dangerous
position
if
the
case
had
been
placed
before
frederick
graves
to
decide
yesterday
he
would
have
hanged
orn
skinner
for
the
murder
of
the
gamekeeper
but
well
his
ideas
of
men
and
of
women
too
had
changed
but
he
did
mean
it
went
on
tess
casting
back
the
unruly
hair
which
shrouded
her
face
in
its
new
state
of
cleanliness
he
have
hurt
a
fly
daddy
skinner
would
a
whistle
from
the
outside
heard
plainly
through
the
beating
of
the
wind
caused
frederick
to
fling
open
the
door
yes
father
he
said
loudly
i
here
i
missed
you
on
the
way
come
in
a
moment
if
you
will
tessibel
gathered
herself
more
closely
into
a
small
human
ball
than
ever
she
had
feared
the
minister
since
the
time
she
had
talked
off
his
warts
with
the
wizard
words
she
had
learned
from
a
hag
living
on
the
ragged
rocks
what
this
demanded
the
dominie
looking
sternly
at
her
and
she
dropped
her
eyes
in
confusion
it
orn
skinner
girl
replied
his
son
skinner
is
the
man
who
shot
stebbins
you
heard
deacon
hall
talking
about
it
at
the
cottage
this
explanation
was
superfluous
for
the
minister
well
knew
the
girl
and
her
father
it
a
nice
mess
your
father
got
himself
into
he
said
harshly
tessibel
lifted
her
head
he
did
mean
to
do
it
sir
she
replied
not
daring
to
rise
because
of
her
bare
long
legs
did
eh
roared
graves
in
his
wrath
placing
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
was
right
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
use
his
gun
or
why
did
he
take
it
with
him
tessibel
raised
her
eyes
to
the
rafters
and
her
face
flooded
with
color
the
rifle
was
gone
daddy
skinner
had
taken
it
with
him
she
was
too
young
to
argue
with
such
a
man
and
only
wiped
her
face
with
her
sleeve
and
sobbed
god
will
see
that
justice
is
done
my
girl
your
father
will
hang
do
you
hear
shouted
graves
hang
by
the
neck
till
he
dead
and
this
shanty
will
be
burned
with
all
its
filth
frederick
clutched
his
father
arm
his
face
changing
from
red
to
white
as
he
watched
tessibel
she
had
clambered
to
her
feet
ridiculously
tangled
in
the
rags
of
her
dress
the
dead
frederick
was
forgotten
falling
with
a
great
thud
upon
the
floor
her
face
was
so
mobile
so
glassily
white
that
if
the
hand
of
death
had
smitten
her
she
could
not
have
looked
ghastlier
standing
before
them
the
tears
drying
over
the
hot
blood
which
rushed
in
torrents
afresh
from
her
heart
to
her
face
tessibel
learned
her
first
lesson
in
suppressed
emotion
she
took
two
steps
backward
and
wound
her
hands
behind
the
post
of
daddy
bed
truly
it
was
tessibel
first
day
and
first
night
he
air
to
be
hanged
dead
she
asked
the
painful
shiftiness
of
her
eyes
settling
questioningly
upon
the
minister
face
aw
he
air
good
daddy
skinner
air
gooder
than
ye
be
with
ye
cross
and
ye
crown
that
ye
sing
about

than
all
ye
whole
church
if
his
gun
did
kill
the
gamekeeper

has
our
rights
to
live
to
eat
bread
and
beans
like
ye
have
hai
we
if
daddy
skinner
air

then
tessibel
hangs
too
here
the
tired
young
face
drooped
a
little
ye
hang
him
will
ye
well
ye
wo
cause
cause
her
red
head
flashed
back
upon
the
uncovered
shoulders
the
wild
eyes
lifted
a
moment
to
the
rocking
rafters
in
the
roof
if
ye
lives
in
the
sky
jesus
that
cares
for
the
dyin
take
daddy
skinner
and
tessibel
her
eyes
dropped
to
the
pan
on
the
floor
against
which
the
stiff
body
of
the
toad
lay
and
she
ended
and
frederick
it
was
a
prayer
a
rough
prayer
from
untaught
lips
but
through
the
action
which
followed
it
instantly
lost
its
dignity
tessibel
forgot
her
lesson
forgot
all
save
the
taunting
face
of
the
minister
she
gave
her
familiar
leap
in
the
air
and
came
down
with
a
cry
upon
the
chest
ye
kill
him
will
ye
then
i
i
air
goin
to
kill
ye
and
deep
into
the
face
of
the
minister
sunk
the
ten
little
fingers
frederick
loosened
her
by
extreme
effort
from
his
father
body
and
thrust
the
gasping
preacher
outside
the
door
the
student
placed
his
hand
upon
the
panting
girl
shoulder
you
wrong
he
said
gravely
your
prayer
was
good
and
god
heard
there
is
in
the
sky
a
suffering
christ
and
his
cross
and
by
your
prayers
you
may
save
your
father
and
also
save
poor
little
tessibel
skinner
then
glancing
about
the
filthy
room
he
added
and
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
she
opened
the
door
proudly
his
words
had
taught
her
a
newer
dignity
this
air
my
shanty
she
said
i
air
sorry
i
hitted
yer
daddy
face
cause
cause
he
air
yer
daddy
scoot
now
chapter
vii
for
one
short
moment
after
the
going
of
frederick
tessibel
stood
gapingly
looking
out
into
the
darkness
the
student
had
gone
and
with
him
her
horror
of
the
minister
the
steps
died
away
and
dazedly
she
closed
the
door
she
remembered
the
day
she
had
talked
the
warts
off
from
graves
hand
remembered
how
he
had
said
to
her
that
she
was
possessed
of
the
devil
just
what
that
meant
the
child
did
know
but
the
darkening
frown
on
the
minister
face
plainly
told
her
that
it
was
nothing
pleasant
since
then
she
had
scurried
away
when
the
dominie
had
appeared
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
heard
the
student
voice
for
he
had
spent
most
of
his
summers
away
from
home
and
the
fisherman
child
had
had
little
chance
to
see
him
he
had
said
that
the
cross
and
crown
would
save
her
daddy
had
said
to
pray
to
the
god
of
whom
she
knew
so
little
and
his
words
had
given
birth
to
a
great
faith
within
her
tessibel
fingers
were
stained
with
frederick
blood
and
shudderingly
she
looked
at
them
in
the
candle
light
frederick
lay
where
she
had
dropped
him
his
fat
white
belly
sunken
and
misshapened
the
very
stillness
of
him
made
the
girl
round
him
in
a
circle
watching
him
with
an
intentness
which
showed
her
superstitious
fear
of
the
stiffening
dead
then
her
great
love
for
him
overwhelmed
her
and
she
darted
like
a
bird
toward
her
friend
i
were
afraid
of
ye
frederick
she
groaned
softly
but
i
ai
no
more
ye
would
hurt
the
kid
what
loves
ye
so
would
ye
if
ye
air
dead
she
turned
the
great
body
over
and
sobbed
again
the
words
of
the
student
softened
her
grief
and
through
frederick
graves
for
the
sake
of
her
loved
ones
she
accepted
his
mysterious
god
and
his
sacrificed
son
with
loving
hands
she
tumbled
the
toad
into
a
soiled
rag
and
placed
him
in
the
corner
there
was
nothing
left
for
her
to
do
save
to
rescue
daddy
skinner
from
the
black
cap
and
she
must
see
him
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
mother
moll
the
settlement
witch
would
tell
her
if
daddy
skinner
were
in
danger
she
opened
the
door
and
stood
for
a
moment
before
stepping
into
the
abating
storm
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
giant
pine
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
far
beyond
her
father
hut
it
was
silhouetted
against
a
light
streak
in
the
southern
sky
its
long
arms
extending
straight
into
the
air
the
branches
of
the
tree
had
always
made
a
fantastic
figure
in
tessibel
eyes
it
took
the
form
of
a
venerable
old
man
and
it
had
been
one
of
her
vivid
imaginings
since
she
could
remember
that
some
time
the
man
shaped
against
the
skies
would
step
down
in
the
flesh
tess
had
grown
to
love
him
in
sunshine
and
in
rain
to
watch
him
in
silent
mystified
longing
as
he
bent
toward
her
day
after
day
in
the
nodding
head
and
swaying
arms
tessibel
suddenly
established
frederick
deity
as
a
man
from
the
east
worships
his
sun
god
through
a
wooden
image
so
tessibel
directed
a
prayer
to
this
moving
figure
in
the
pine
tree
her
lips
parted
slightly
as
she
stood
for
a
short
space
of
time
watching
him
if
ye
be
a
god
she
breathed
help
me
see
my
daddy
she
said
this
with
bowed
head
for
grief
and
the
student
admonition
had
made
a
path
for
reverence
through
her
soul
then
she
closed
the
cabin
door
and
started
toward
the
shore
pushing
a
flat
boat
into
the
lake
which
was
still
turbulent
from
the
storm
she
deftly
rounded
the
long
fishing
dock
rowing
to
the
bobbing
little
fish
car
which
held
daddy
eels
she
pulled
out
the
nail
and
holding
up
the
top
of
the
car
ran
her
hand
quickly
about
inside
drawing
out
four
huge
eels
she
threw
them
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
closed
the
trap
door
and
rowed
away
toward
the
shore
inside
the
shanty
she
placed
the
fish
upon
the
wooden
table
and
stood
for
an
instant
regarding
them
one
long
eel
drew
itself
into
tense
half
circles
turning
over
and
over
until
as
he
neared
the
edge
of
the
table
tessibel
caught
him
longer
the
girl
eyes
rested
upon
this
one
suddenly
she
snatched
him
up
slipping
him
wriggling
first
into
the
water
pail
still
holding
fast
to
the
pointed
head
god
made
ye
beautiful
she
crooned
ye
can
stay
there
and
let
me
pet
ye
i
air
got
to
have
somethin
to
love
turning
back
to
the
table
she
contemplated
the
remaining
fish
for
thirty
seconds
or
so
in
indecision
had
her
own
desire
ruled
she
would
have
put
them
all
back
into
the
lake
she
would
not
have
killed
them
but
it
was
for
daddy
sake
he
was
more
to
her
than
all
of
nature
creatures
with
expert
fingers
she
sent
the
life
from
the
twisting
eels
and
gathering
them
into
a
small
bag
tessibel
slung
them
over
her
arm
and
broke
off
into
the
dark
forest
the
twigs
cracking
under
her
small
bare
feet
as
she
went
here
and
there
the
curls
of
red
hair
would
catch
in
the
branches
and
the
girl
would
tear
them
loose
leaving
a
blazed
trail
of
copper
threads
marking
her
path
up
to
the
ragged
rocks
she
went
through
the
gorges
and
brooks
until
she
came
in
sight
of
a
small
dark
hut
set
deeply
in
the
opposite
bank
of
a
ravine
through
which
water
was
flowing
to
reach
the
hut
the
child
scaled
the
deep
gorge
and
clambered
up
the
other
side
the
shanty
was
dark
and
tessibel
stood
long
looking
intently
at
it
over
the
top
which
was
covered
with
tar
paper
scraped
the
branches
of
a
large
tree
the
wind
was
dashing
a
dead
vine
mournfully
against
a
broken
window
although
on
friendly
terms
with
mother
moll
tess
had
always
stood
in
awe
of
her
but
the
squatter
girl
had
infinite
confidence
in
the
future
events
foretold
by
the
witch
she
must
see
the
woman
must
ask
her
news
of
daddy
skinner
from
the
fortune

the
dead
fish
hanging
upon
the
slender
arm

to
propitiate
the
witch
anger
for
being
dragged
from
her
bed
in
the
night
tess
stepped
shivering
to
the
door
and
knocked
receiving
no
answer
she
sent
another
pealing
sound
through
the
howling
wind
for
she
knew
mother
moll
was
there
suddenly
a
voice
came
from
within
what

a
scramble
a
hurrying
sound
from

and
the
door
was
dragged
open
tess
stepped
into
the
dark
room
the
whizzing
of
insects
overhead
coming
dimly
to
her
through
the
rocking
of
the
shanty
one
clammy
night
bat
whirled
close
to
her
but
was
gone
before
she
could
put
up
her
hand
it
air
a
bad
night
that
brought
the
brat
out
to

so
it

was
feeling
about

as
she
croaked
out
her
words

not

waited
until

lighted
a
candle
and
then
dropped
her
load
upon

floor

suspiciously
maybe

them
myself

a
time
ago

tess
it

them
to

water
but
they
fills
your
pot
for
many

mess
it
was
a
tempting
wage
for
the
hag
she
blew
the
dying
grate
embers
into
a
blaze
over
which
she
hung
a
small
iron
pot
the
bats
had
ceased
the
infernal
flapping
of
their
grotesque
wings
and
were
clinging
trembling
to
the
rafters

them
through

shadows

slowly
counted
them

over

was
a
woman
older
than
any
one
even
dared
guess
with
a
cackling
laugh
she
always
answered
questions
as
to
her
age
with
the
assertion
that
she
was
nigh
on
to
two
hundred
and
a
deal
more
than
that
and
no
one
could
contradict
her
for
she
was
old
when

awfulness

despair

into

its
hold
upon

by

light
of

candle

its
course
about

it
was
true
he
only
spent
ten

twelve
weeks
of
the
summer
in

but
every
man
desired
his
own
for
several
years
there
had
been
a
continual
fight
between
the
pastor
and
the
fisherman
orn
skinner
answering
the
minister
with
the
squatter
law
of
the
state
which
gave
him
the
use
of
the
few
feet
of
ground
upon
which
his

insisted
that
some
day
he
would
rid
his
summer
home
of
the
pest
and
the
time

come
after
leaving
tessibel
he
walked
up
the
long
lane
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
son
sputtering
against
his
enemies

idea
of

malicious

his

if
we

a
request
to
take
what

said
only
that
he
would
like
to
see
all
the
squatters
gone
we
decided
to
make
a
move
frederick
tried
to
make
a
small
complaint
but
the
minister
commanded
him
to
silence
get
rid
of
them
i
will
do
you
hear
he
shouted
they
have
no
moral
right
there
whatever
the
law
says
get
rid
of
them
i
will
when
the
dominie
reiterated
strongly
his
whole
family
remained
silent
and
this
time
frederick
dared
pass
no
remark
he
wondered
if
it
were
not
for
just
such
people
as
the
skinners
that
the
christ
had
suffered
he
felt
an
incentive
rising
in
his
heart
to
seek
guidance
from
the
book
for
although
frederick
graves
greatly
reverenced
his
father
he
would
not
give
up
his
own
opinions
without
a
struggle
i
got
this
skinner
just
where
i
want
him
after
all
these
years
hurled
forth
the
minister
as
they
passed
the
pear

and
then
added
but
i
do
understand
how
you
came
to
be
in
the
hut
i
heard
the

crying
replied
frederick
curtly
i

charlie
called
me
back
to
ask
about
the
plans
for
the
new
church
and
if
i
had
not
whistled
just
when
i
did
you
might
have
been
in
that
hut
still
i
suppose
frederick
found
himself
wishing
that
his
father
had
not
whistled
his
mind
going
back
to
the
girl
in
the
shanty
whom
he
had
left
with
her
living
grief
and
her
dead
he
saw
his
sister
teola
standing
on
the
broad
porch
waiting
for
them
the
girl
scented
something
unusual
in
the
angry
tones
of
her
voice
she
followed
frederick
alone
into
the
library
which
looked
out
upon
tessibel
hut
what
the
matter
frederick
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
nothing
much
the
brother
and
sister
had
grown
into
a
confidential
friendship
during
the
past
two
years
teola
face
dropped
as
she
heard
halting
answer
i
know
better
she
retorted
decidedly
you
have
been
having
words
with
father
no
not
words
replied
the
boy
but
you
see
father
thinks
that
no
one
can
have
any
ideas
but
himself
it
sort
of
makes
me
tired
for
sometimes
i
know
when
a
thing
is
right
or
wrong
what
was
the
matter
insisted
teola
once
more
the
skinners
replied
frederick
slowly
you
mean
the
squatters
yes
are
they
alright
where
they
are
hesitated
teola
skinner
killed
the
gamekeeper
and
the
girl
is
alone
in
the
shanty
father
does
seem
to
realize
that
they
have
souls
to
be
saved
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
world
teola
thought
an
instant
before
answering
they
are
so
dirty
she
said
at
last
that
true
frederick
reflected
but
nevertheless
they
are
human
were
you
in
the
hut
yes
with
father
whew
what
did
he
say
the
question
was
answered
by
loud
words
from
the
minister
talking
to
his
wife
in
the
dining
room
i
tell
you
said
his
voice
ringing
out
so
that
the
two
listeners
could
hear
those
squatters
have
got
to
go
i
not
the
only
one
who
thinks
that
way
if
they
had
the
instincts
of
decency
i
would
say
a
word
but
they
have
i
say
it
time
to
make
a
move
you
know
continued
the
minister
that
their
hut
is
in
direct
line
with
our
view
there
no
buying
them
off
i
tried
that
now
that
skinner
is
arrested
it
wo
be
hard
to
frighten
the
girl
away
for
she
ca
stay
there
alone
i
not
so
sure
mused
graves
those
people
are
not
easily
frightened
she
afraid
of
me
shouted
the
dominie
and
she
will
be
more
so
before
i
get
through
with
her
and
her
father
if
skinner
is
hanged
she
sha
stay
there
later
there
was
a
long
discussion
between
the
father
and
son
upon
the
rights
of
squatters
which
ended
in
frederick
going
to
bed
before
it
was
half
finished
more
disgusted
and
unhappy
than
he
had
ever
been
before
he
looked
out
upon
the
lake
the
wind
was
still
rolling
the
water
into
white
crested
waves
and
his
eyes
could
scarcely
outline
the
small
hut
under
the
willow
tree
into
the
boy
life
something
had
come
a
new
something
he
could
not
explain
while
out
of
it
another
something
as
hard
to
define
had
gone
forever
two
jack
rabbits
perched
on
the
tracks
above
the
fodder
lot
of
minister
graves
lifted
their
long
ears
and
listened
human
steps
at
this
time
of
night
were
out
of
the
ordinary
the
dog
at
kennedy
farm
beyond
the
tracks
heard
them
too
and
bayed
loudly
then
as
they
grew
more
distinct
he
bounded
toward
the
fence
capering
madly
about
to
scent
the
intruder
it
was
but
a
forlorn
little
figure
but
pete
the
brindle
bull
lifting
his
voice
in
a
pleased
howl
crouched
close
to
the
fence
as
a
small
hand
came
through
to
pet
him
it
air
only
tess
said
a
voice
in
which
tears
had
gathered
ye
air
glad
to
see
tess
ai
ye
tess
air
glad
to
see
ye
too
frederick
and
daddy
air
gone
and
i
must
be
goin
tessibel
placed
her
face
down
near
the
big
dog
and
he
shoved
out
his
long
red
tongue
touching
her
with
delight
the
girl
hugged
the
large
head
with
an
admonishing
appeal
that
pete
must
go
back
to
his
kennel
and
stepped
again
to
the
track
that
long
black
winding
road
which
she
must
travel
before
reaching
her
destination
it
was
raining
again
the
water
falling
in
steady
drops
upon
the
bare
head
frequently
the
girl
wiped
the
water
from
her
face
with
a
torn
calico
skirt
once
she
sat
down
and
gathered
her
feet
under
her
wet
dress
to
stop
their
stinging
pain
and
here
alone
under
the
dark
sky
tessibel
offered
up
her
first
balanced
prayer
for
had
not
frederick
said
that
god
would
save
daddy
skinner
he
do
say
and
she
lifted
her
eyes
upward
with
a
simultaneous
wipe
at
her
face
that
there
air
a
god
who
help
my
daddy
i
wants
to
find
my
daddy
for
a
minute
a
little
minute
be
it
pleasin
to
ye
goddy
tessibel
always
put
dy
to
dad
to
make
it
more
effective
and
it
was
with
the
same
sweet
serious
voice
with
which
she
would
have
pleaded
with
her
own
father
that
she
made
familiar
with
the
majesty
of
heaven
she
could
make
no
distinction
between
daddy
skinner
and
jehovah
both
to
her
were
the
reigning
powers
of
the
earth
daddy
she
had
always
known
but
the
other
frederick
had
said
it
was
good
to
pray
she
rose
stumbling
and
at
three
in
the
morning
entered
the
city
of
ithaca
walking
up
state
street
drabbled
and
thoroughly
wet
she
knew
the
streets
that
led
to
the
city
jail
for
many
a
time
when
selling
greens
and
berries
had
she
gone
steathily
to
the
gray
stone
building
and
examined
the
barred
windows
she
crossed
dewitt
park
and
passed
by
the
churches
which
surrounded
the
jail
around
and
around
the
stone
structure
wandered
the
barefooted
girl
she
could
not
distinguish
one
ray
of
light
at
first
in
any
of
the
windows
suddenly
she
stopped
and
took
a
long
breath
up
near
the
roof
line
a
faint
light
flickered
some
one
was
moving
to
and
fro
tessibel
could
distinguish
a
rounded
shadow
on
the
ceiling
of
the
cell
and
tears
choked
her
as
she
saw
cast
upon
the
wall
the
shadowy
outline
of
a
large
humpbacked
form
it
was
daddy
daddy
skinner
and
tessibel
backed
from
the
building
straining
her
eyes
to
get
a
better
view
of
him
now
the
image
was
in
sight
again
it
disappeared
daddy
was
walking
up
and
down
but
he
did
not
come
near
enough
to
the
window
for
her
to
see
his
face
seven
times
she
counted
daddy
rounded
shadow
on
the
wall
and
seven
times
it
faded
the
eighth
a
grizzled
head
cast
its
outline
distinctly
across
the
bars
daddy
aw
daddy
skinner
it
was
only
a
loving
name
breathed
by
a
troubled
child
but
it
was
caught
in
its
upward
flight
by
the
father
ear
above
tess
saw
the
pictured
humps
pause
and
as
she
whispered
the
name
again
daddy
skinner
came
to
the
iron
lattice
she
could
discern
her
father
plainly
through
the
rain
and
held
her
arms
up
toward
him
it
air
lonely
in
the
shanty
in
the
shanty
without
ye
daddy
she
breathed
and
tessibel
air
sorry
for
all
her
badness
come
home
daddy
dear
good
daddy
and
tess
she
stopped
for
a
sight
strange
and
unusual
fell
upon
her
daddy
skinner
was
looking
down
clinging
to
the
bars
mightily
his
under
lip
shaking
his
dark
teeth
chattering
together
the
grizzled
head
making
a
sharp
picture
of
misery
in
the
barred
window
emotion
in
her
father
was
new
to
tess
a
little
frightened
cry
fell
from
her
lips
and
she
clutched
hurriedly
at
the
thick
creeping
ivy
which
clung
to
the
old
gray
stone
building
i
air
comin
daddy
skinner
she
cried
i
air
comin
she
followed
the
main
body
of
the
ivy
on
its
upward
growth
slipping
and
sliding
on
the
wet
creeper
as
she
made
her
perilous
ascent
daddy
skinner
was
near
the
roof
and
it
took
tessibel
many
torturing
minutes
to
reach
him
he
knew
she
was
coming
by
the
continual
dragging
at
the
ivy
but
he
dared
not
speak
for
the
guard
walked
outside
his
door
in
the
hall
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
would
bring
danger
to
tess
once
he
strained
his
face
to
the
bars
saw
her
climbing
frantically
and
the
sight
made
him
dizzy
he
could
only
wait
wait
the
interminable
time
until
the
head
appeared
and
the
wide
eyes
stared
into
his
skinner
quietly
drew
his
child
to
the
stone
sill
and
placed
his
fingers
over
her
lips
to
enjoin
silence
tess
understood
and
even
drew
softer
breaths
holding
tightly
to
the
beloved
hands
i
comed
for
kisses
on
the
bill
daddy
she
breathed
tess
air
lonely
without
ye
the
livid
shaking
lips
met
the
quivering
mouth
through
the
iron
rods
a
long
long
kiss
such
as
tess
had
wanted
quieted
her
suffering
a
little
it
was
the
same
old
daddy
whom
she
was
going
to
save
by
praying
she
had
asked
to
see
him
only
a
minute
and
the
student
god
had
granted
her
prayer
she
whispered
again
shivering
and
shaking
with
the
cold
did
ye
kill
the
gamekeeper
daddy
the
gray
head
shook
the
answer
no
if
ye
did
ye
did
mean
to
did
ye
the
two
negative
replies
made
tessibel
heart
bound
it
would
be
easier
for
god
to
help
him
if
he
had
not
committed
a
crime
and
for
no
instant
did
she
doubt
his
word
she
kissed
him
again
passionately
clinging
to
his
lips
with
all
the
young
growing
emotion
in
her
body
the
squatter
clung
desperately
to
the
body
of
his
child
he
could
not
let
her
go
fearing
she
would
fall
to
the
hard
stones
below
but
he
knew
that
she
stood
in
danger
of
being
discovered
and
dared
not
detain
her
kin
ye
get
down
again
he
whispered
yep

skinner
and
ye
ai
goin
to
hang
some
one
what

goin
to
help
ye
who

god
up
there
and
tessibel
motioned
with
her
hand
toward
the
dark
sky
he
says
as
how
he
helps
folks
like
us
that
a
cross
was
beared
for
us
and
i
says
to

sheriff
if

can
come
afternoons
to

and
daddy
i

shanty
till

he
kissed
her
small
pinched
face
again
and
again
and
took
his
arms
away
tess
slipped
down
the
creeper
and
when
she
reached
the
ground
called
softly
i
air
here
daddy
skinner
she
saw
him
pressing
against
the
bars
his
lips
shaking
and
his
eyes
closely
shut
as
if
he
were
stumblingly
offering
a
prayer
for
the
child
of
his
fisherman
soul
chapter
ix
the
fraternities
of
cornell
university
gave
home
and
social
comforts
to
students
rich
and
popular
enough
to
be
invited
to
join
them
each
fraternity
had
its
own
spacious
house
with
its
staff
of
servants
where
the
members
lived
during
the
college
year
every
man
had
the
ambition
to
join
one
which
if
he
attained
assured
him
a
luxurious
home
during
the
four
years
he
spent
in
ithaca
one
evening
three
weeks
after
tessibel
secret
visit
to
her
father
in
the
city
jail
twenty
fraternities
were
preparing
all
the
practical
jokes
which
boyish
minds
could
concoct
with
which
to
initiate
their
new
candidates
to
full
membership
five
new
men
were
to
join
the
cranium
fraternity
the
house
of
this
society
stood
high
upon
the
eastern
hill
above
the
lake
and
overlooked
the
town
the
first
story
of
the
building
contained
the
smoking
dining
billiard
and
two
drawing
rooms
above
were
sleeping
chambers
and
private
studies
for
the
students
and
annexed
to
the
house
proper
was
a
small
stone
structure
built
purposely
for
the
initiation
of
the
new
members
on
this
night
all
interest
was
centered
upon
the
annex
where
frederick
graves
dan
jordan
billy
dillon
oscar
brown
and
jimmy
preston
were
to
be
taken
through
the
stunts
in
the
afternoon
the
five
young
men
had
been
locked
in
one
of
the
student
rooms
and
told
that
they
would
receive
their
dinner
during
the
proceedings
that
evening
the
gravity
which
had
settled
upon
the
upper
classmen
frightened
the
three
smaller
candidates
for
billy
oscar
and
jimmy
were
miniatures
in
size
compared
to
dan
jordan
and
frederick
graves
do
you
think
they
are
going
to
hurt
us
asked
billy
dillon
turning
to
the
two
larger
students
i
do
want
to
be
hurt
i
like
the
thought
of
being
a
fraternity
man
but
i
do
want
to
go
through
any
business
that
will
injure
me
neither
do
i
put
in
oscar
brown
i
promised
my
mother
it
wo
be
well
with
you
fellows
if
those
chaps
downstairs
hear
you
talking
that
way
cautioned
jordan
besides
the
initiation
is
only
fun
and
any
of
us
are
willing
to
stand
jokes
after
a
wait
a
group
of
sophomores
and
the
tormentors
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
ordered
the
candidates
to
follow
them
into
the
dreaded
annex
in
this
torture
chamber
the
older
members
juniors
and
seniors
seated
on
benches
placed
around
the
wall
were
waiting
gravely
the
arrival
of
their
victims
the
honors
of
the
occasion
had
been
given
into
the
hands
of
the
sophomores
and
as
they
trailed
in
followed
by
the
quaking
applicants
a
hush
fell
over
the
expectant
members
of
the
society
the
five
freshmen
were
ordered
to
stand
in
a
row
and
richard
hall
the
spokesman
of
the
class
came
forward
holding
up
one
hand
in
mock
reverence
gentlemen
he
began
i
first
christen
you
all
in
the
name
of
the
fraternity
i
give
you
dillon
the
name
of
you
brown
shall
be
dubbed
here
he
hesitated
an
instant
perusing
a
slip
of
paper
which
lay
on
the
table
beside
him
preston
you
may
add
another
to
make
a
trio
your
name
shall
be
hall
allowed
his
eyes
to
gaze
reflectively
upon
dan
jordan
to
a
big
fellow
like
you
jordan
he
resumed
i
give
his
voice
dropped
as
if
he
had
either
overlooked
or
forgotten
frederick
and
the
young
fellow
waited
expectantly
suddenly
hall
flashed
him
a
glance
then
dropped
his
eyes
with
twitching
lips
is
good
enough
for
you
graves
sweeping
the
five
candidates
with
his
searching
gaze
he
took
up
the
speech
again
if
at
any
time
your
fraternity
brothers
desire
to
call
you
by
your
new
names
and
you
refuse
to
answer
you
shall
receive
the
punishment
which
goes
with
disobedience
gentlemen
he
said
again
dismissing
the
last
subject
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
it
gives
us
great
pleasure
to
receive
you
into
this
fraternity
but
before
we
can
give
you
full
membership
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
go
through
a
few
more
formalities
hall
eye
fell
in
hesitation
upon
the
ponderous
form
of
dan
jordan
you
will
all
no
doubt
soon
see
the
value
of
prompt
obedience
his
voice
rang
out
and
a
smile
touched
each
corner
of
his
lips
but
faded
instantly
the
three
little
freshmen
moved
uneasily
hall
with
a
touch
of
irony
in
his
tones
directed
the
rest
of
his
instructions
to
them
we
have
decided
resumed
the
speaker
to
initiate
you
fellows
all
at
one
time
oscar
brown
sighed
in
relief
misery
loves
company
and
if
the
society
had
any
indignities
to
bestow
he
would
not
be
alone
we
have
found
it
necessary
in
times
past
hall
took
up
again
with
a
tragic
tone
in
his
voice
to
use
discipline
upon
such
occasions
as
this
and
if
by
chance
an
incoming
member
becomes
obstreperous
we
employ
a
friend
to
help
us
he
holds
an
honored
position
in
our
fraternity
manchester
introduce
the
sophomore
thus
adjured
stepped
nimbly
to
the
corner
and
lifting
from
a
hook
a
long
carpet
beater
brought
it
toward
hall
handle
him
with
reverence
shouted
the
spokesman
taking
it
carefully
in
his
hands
and
turning
it
over
with
a
benign
smile
many
a
time
has
done
good
service
for
this
frat
you
will
understand
the
freshmen
heard
him
say
that
an
indecorous
smile
on
any
of
your
faces
will
immediately
call
for
three
strokes
from
and
he
waved
the
carpet
beater
threateningly
and
for
disobedience
you
will
get
five
we
will
now
proceed
to
business
jordan
and
graves
please
step
forward
blindfold
the
eyes
of
those
two
frank
hall
ended
addressing
one
of
his
classmates
near
him
he
turned
to
a
group
of
his
companions
and
after
whispering
with
them
came
back
saying
aloud
that
a
good
one
to
begin
with
directing
his
eyes
upon
jordan
he
said
down
upon
the
floor
and
scramble
like
an
egg
captain
a
titter
came
from
billy
dillon
duck
that
fresh
chicken
for
laughing
shouted
hall
and
give
him
three
strokes
of
the
a
sophomore
brought
a
pail
of
cold
water
and
two
other
students
grasping
the
little
fellow
immersed
his
curly
head
in
it
they
then
stood
him
on
his
feet
and
laid
the
carpet
beater
three
times
across
his
back
billy
almost
wished
he
had
not
chosen
the
fraternity
life
but
the
others
were
suffering
with
him
which
made
it
easier
than
if
he
had
been
alone
meanwhile
dan
jordan
was
industriously
trying
to
imitate
a
cooking
egg
scramble
captain
scramble
cried
a
sophomore
prodding
jordan
with
a
stick
cook
the
too
shouted
some
one
and
frederick
was
ordered
to
follow
the
movements
of
his
friend
a
faint
flush
mounted
to
the
broad
brow
of
the
minister
son
and
he
hesitated
bring
the
commanded
hall
and
the
eager
sophomore
rushed
up
with
the
persuader
scramble
you
he
roared
waving
the
carpet
beater
dangerously
near
frederick
head
and
down
beside
his
strapping
friend
dropped
the
dignified
frederick
two
more
long
legs
and
two
more
heavy
arms
were
wiggling
over
the
floor
those
eggs
are
burning
give
them
some
grease
suggested
a
senior
from
his
seat
near
the
wall
an
agile
willing
sophomore
snatched
a
bucket
of
water
and
emptied
its
contents
over
the
two
floundering
giants
as
the
icy
bath
submerged
the
freshmen
dan
jordan
sputtering
and
gasping
bounded
to
his
feet
five
strokes
of
the
for
the
shouted
the
delighted
manchester
waving
the
carpet
beater
he
got
up
without
permission
three
students
held
jordan
fast
and
the
little
sophomore
dancing
with
glee
belabored
the
huge
half
scrambled
egg
each
blow
resounding
through
the
room
there
i
guess
that
will
hold
him
a
while
chuckled
the
chastiser
putting
the
carpet
beater
under
his
arm
his
face
reflecting
the
pleasure
of
duty
frederick
wet
and
looking
very
bored
was
still
flopping
about
the
floor
and
after
passing
a
few
more
remarks
about
rotten
eggs
and
undignified
positions
the
sophomores
allowed
him
to
stand
up
now
put
the
wet
booby
in
the
corner
ordered
hall
and
frederick
was
accordingly
led
away
oscar
brown
and
jimmy
preston
a
little
pale
after
witnessing
dan
jordan
punishment
were
then
told
to
come
forward
both
trembled
perceptibly
as
they
were
blindfolded
by
a
sophomore
and
commanded
to
lie
upon
their
backs
upon
the
floor
you
fellows
are
going
to
get
that
dinner
we
promised
you
now
he
said
stooping
over
the
frightened
prostrate
students
and
giving
the
bandages
a
last
tightening
pull
the
first
course
consists
of
something
you
are
sure
to
like
and
we
guarantee
them
to
be
absolutely
fresh
bring
the
supper
in
for
these
kids
are
hungry
some
one
brought
a
dish
and
the
two
boys
could
plainly
hear
the
rattle
of
the
cover
as
it
came
off
open
your
mouths
came
the
next
command
oscar
brown
timidly
opened
his
lips
and
waited
but
jimmy
preston
thinking
the
joke
had
gone
far
enough
obstinately
refused
to
open
his
lips
bang
came
the
carpet
beater
over
the
side
of
his
leg
and
his
mouth
flew
open
like
a
trapdoor
that
just
a
little
reminder
for
you
to
do
as
you
are
told
spuddy
the
wielder
of
the
mazuka
laughed
here
the
dinner
boys
cried
hall
and
i
bet
you
ca
imagine
what
we
brought
you
do
you
know
what
that
is
brown
shivered
for
something
and
cold
was
drawn
across
his
cheek
it
an
angle
worm
continued
the
speaker
and
you
going
to
eat
it
do
be
afraid
you
need
wiggle
you
are
going
to
have
one
too
he
added
the
last
part
of
the
sentence
seeing
a
shudder
pass
over
the
form
of
the
other
blindfolded
boy
keep
your
mouths
wide
open
shouted
a
senior
simultaneously
the
two
boys
felt
the
promised
but
undesirable
dinner
drop
into
their
mouths
with
a
groan
oscar
brown
rolled
over
on
his
side
and
allowed
his
portion
to
fall
slowly
out
but
jimmy
preston
amid
howls
of
joy
from
the
onlookers
jumped
to
his
feet
and
tore
the
bandage
from
his
eyes
no
fraternity
for
me
he
yelled
i
never
heard
of
such
a
dirty
trick
if
you
fellows
his
disgusted
gaze
fell
upon
the
plate
held
by
a
sophomore
convulsed
with
laughter
jimmy
rubbed
his
eyes
blinked
and
looked
again
blank
astonishment
taking
the
place
of
his
anger
in
the
dish
were
only
a
few
strings
of
cold
cooked
macaroni
golly
what
a
fool
i
am
and
jimmy
glanced
about
upon
the
grinning
faces
with
a
sheepish
air
that
what
you
are
alright
said
manchester
trying
to
be
serious
and
securing
a
better
grip
upon
the
carpet
beater
who
said
you
could
take
that
bandage
off
that
will
cost
you
five
strokes
of
the
here
fellows
hold
him
on
his
stomach
over
that
chair
so
that
i
can
get
in
some
of
my
fine
strokes
one
two
three
four
five
jimmy
was
jerked
to
his
feet
the
injured
expression
upon
his
sorrowful
face
plainly
showing
manchester
that
his
strokes
had
been
telling
ones
there
we
through
with
you
for
old
boy
said
manchester
proudly
feeling
his
biceps
go
sit
down
if
you
can
and
jimmy
limped
away
with
a
muttered
thank
heaven
during
a
conference
in
undertones
amid
giggling
and
snickering
richard
unfolded
a
new
plan
then
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
one
of
you
fellows
see
if
the
surgeon
is
here
yet
and
hurry
back
billy
dillon
who
had
remained
in
trembling
silence
during
the
proceedings
received
his
bandage
without
a
complaint
although
his
face
was
ashy
pale
and
his
knees
shook
beneath
him
as
hall
approached
what
did
they
want
a
doctor
for
they
surely
would
do
anything
bad
enough
to
need
a
surgeon
thoughts
like
these
went
racing
through
his
frightened
mind
the
sophomore
leading
him
in
terrifying
darkness
to
a
chair
near
by
silence
fell
upon
the
room
and
all
that
billy
could
hear
was
his
own
excited
breathing
made
louder
by
the
explosive
beats
of
his
heart
swipes
he
heard
hall
say
we
decided
that
we
ca
stand
that
pretty
face
of
yours
around
but
as
we
like
you
and
do
want
to
send
you
away
we
will
change
the
expression
on
it
a
gash
on
each
of
those
rosy
cheeks
will
alter
your
whole
appearance
so
much
that
not
one
of
your
lady
friends
will
ever
recognize
you
again
in
after
days
when
you
grow
to
be
a
man
you
will
thank
us
for
this
frank
tell
wallace
to
come
in
a
pause
and
billy
heard
the
door
open
and
close
and
someone
coming
toward
him
the
person
smelling
strongly
of
drugs
is
this
the
unfortunate
young
man
asked
a
strange
but
not
altogether
unfamiliar
voice
yes
billy
heard
hall
answer
in
heartbroken
tones
and
please
doctor
do
the
best
you
can
for
him
oh
we
fix
him
alright
in
just
about
a
minute
responded
the
strange
voice
hall
will
you
please
hold
his
arms
for
when
patients
are
excited
they
sometimes
forget
themselves
and
now
my
instruments
please
billy
arms
were
held
tightly
behind
him
and
for
a
moment
he
heard
nothing
then
came
to
his
ears
the
sound
of
a
box
being
unclasped
and
horror
of
horrors
the
rattle
of
surgical
instruments
would
they
dare
cut
his
face
why
his
father
would
billy
felt
the
cold
blade
of
the
knife
touch
his
flesh
and
hot
blood
run
down
to
his
chin
upon
this
he
became
possessed
by
the
strength
of
a
giant
jerking
his
hands
loose
he
struck
out
with
all
his
might
his
fist
hitting
something
with
the
force
of
a
kicking
donkey
there
was
a
sound
of
some
one
falling
and
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
students
as
billy
was
grasped
by
what
seemed
a
thousand
hands
the
bandage
was
snatched
from
his
eyes
and
he
looked
upon
a
sorry
sight
manchester
the
expert
wielder
of
the
mazuka
had
failed
as
a
surgeon
he
lay
a
few
feet
away
amid
pieces
of
broken
ice
which
he
had
pretended
was
a
surgical
knife
his
coat
bespotted
with
hot
milk
which
represented
poor
blood
and
his
left
hand
clasped
tightly
over
a
swollen
eye
what
hit
me
gasped
the
fictitious
wallace
what
hit
manchester
fellows
one
of
the
seniors
managed
to
howl
out
to
the
convulsed
fraternity
members
i
believe
that
rascally
freshman
did
it
exclaimed
manchester
excitedly
bring
me
the
and
i
put
a
bunch
on
him
that
never
will
come
off
gee
whiz
look
at
his
eye
some
one
called
out
this
brought
manchester
to
a
standstill
what
the
matter
with
it
he
groaned
putting
his
hand
again
to
his
face
is
it
gone
the
lids
were
puffed
shut
and
were
rapidly
darkening
richard
hall
laughing
uproariously
held
a
pocket
mirror
for
the
young
sophomore
to
peep
into
after
a
moment
contemplation
of
his
bruised
face
manchester
came
forth
in
a
hoarse
whisper
that
freshman
got
to
die
if
i
only
had
an
ax
and
his
one
eye
gazed
wildly
around
in
search
of
a
weapon
come
come
teddy
manchester
soothed
a
tall
senior
we
arrange
with
the
freshman
alright
do
work
yourself
into
unnecessary
excitement
and
he
shall
use
all
his
spending

for
your
tobacco

the
entire
year
cajoled

and
black
your

and
besides
you

get
a
chance
to
get
even
at
the
freshmen
banquet
he
whispered
gentlemen
he
concluded
turning
with
a
winning
smile
upon
the
assembled
society

chapter

minister
graves
city
home
the
rectory
was
a
magnificent
house
covered
with
a
thick
growth
of
ivy
one
bay
window
ornamenting
it
on
the
west
another
looking
on
the
street
the
first
evening
in
november
the
family
was
seated
about
the
table
the
minister
reading
the
evening
paper
babe
was
arguing
with
her
mother
that
all
little
girls
should
be
allowed
to
roller
skate
upon
the
pavement
that
there
was
a
bit
of
danger
in
it
frederick
was
silently
eating
his
dinner
teola
following
his
example
suddenly
the
minister
ejaculated
ah
that
good
what
good
father
inquired
graves
skinner
is
brought
to
trial
the
paper
says
there
is
the
slightest
hope
for
him
to
escape
and
listen
to
this
of
all
the
happenings
in
the
annals
of
the
ithaca
courts
the
following
is
the
most
extraordinary
orn
skinner
the
squatter
who
is
to
be
tried
this
week
for
the
murder
of
emery
stebbins
the
game
warden
is
the
father
of
a
girl
some
fifteen
years
old
the
day
after
his
incarceration
the
girl
presented
herself
at
the
office
of
the
sheriff
asking
permission
to
see
her
father
the
sheriff
thought
wiser
not
and
refused
the
request
but
the
night
before
last
the
girl
was
discovered
ascending
like
a
squirrel
the
thick
growth
of
ivy
that
covers
the
stone
structure
of
the
jail
for
nearly
a
month
she
has
been
tramping
the
lehigh
valley
railroad
tracks
after
dark
reaching
the
jail
at
midnight
and
holding
converse
with
her
father
on
the
stone
sill
of
his
cell
window
two
stories
above
the
ground
the
girl
was
closely
questioned
but
refused
to
answer
probably
fearing
the
consequences
of
visiting
a
prisoner
without
the
consent
of
the
sheriff
skinner
has
been
removed
to
an
inner
cell
the
authorities
fearing
some
plan
of
escape
the
girl
is
very
pretty
with
long
red
hair
and
brown
eyes
and
those
who
have
seen
her
say
that
she
is
like
a
frightened
rabbit
refusing
to
talk
with
any
save
a
few
of
her
kind
the
dominie
grunted
as
he
finished
reading
i
should
think
they
would
remove
him
to
an
inner
cell
said
he
such
goings
on
the
girl
ought
to
have
a
taste
of
the
rawhide
maybe
she
loves
her
father
and
wanted
to
see
him
ventured
babe
who
had
no
reverence
for
paternal
opinions
love
love
retorted
the
dominie
all
the
love
those
people
have
in
their
lives
you
could
put
in
a
nutshell
her
father
trial
comes
up
i
wonder
if
they
will
allow
the
girl
to
attend
this
was
from
frederick
he
had
not
seen
tessibel
since
the
night
he
had
told
her
how
to
help
her
father
his
face
gathered
a
crimson
shade
as
he
remembered
that
he
had
promised
her
that
he
too
would
pray
for
her
daddy
the
sympathy
he
had
felt
in
his
heart
throbbed
again
as
he
thought
of
her
lonely
grief
and
the
dead
toad
he
would
keep
his
promise
to
tess
pray
that
something
might
come
into
her
life
if
somebody
went
out
mother
said
teola
changing
the
subject
abruptly
why
ca
we
have
a
toffy
pull
i
want
one
so
badly
it
such
a
messy
thing
sighed
graves
looking
about
upon
the
tidy
home
and
not
one
of
you
young
people
can
keep
your
sticky
hands
from
the
curtains
and
furniture
but
i
suppose
if
you
will
have
it
nothing
i
can
say
will
alter
it
but
remember
this
i
wo
have
those
boys
and
girls
tramping
through
my
house
and
mussing
up
everything
as
they
rose
from
the
table
teola
followed
her
brother
into
the
hall
frederick
if
i
arrange
the
toffy
pull
do
you
suppose
jordan
would
come
she
dropped
her
eyes
the
blood
curling
to
the
edge
of
the
tiny
ringlets
that
clung
to
her
forehead
her
brother
gave
a
low
laugh
he
would
be
only
too
pleased
sis
and
he
is
a
capital
chap
he
a
great
favorite
at
the
frat
with
all
the
boys
shall
i
invite
him
yes
for
day
after
evening
will
that
suit
you
let
me
see
reflected
frederick
we
are
having
a
meeting
at
the
fraternity
but
we
might
come
down
afterward
unless
we
are
kept
too
late
do
let
them
keep
you
pleaded
teola
flashing
her
brilliant
eyes
into
frederick
face
you
and
jordan
have
influence
enough
to
get
away
even
if
you
are
freshmen
the
student
stooped
and
kissed
his
sister
fondly
i
arrange
it
to
suit
you
sister
i
want
to
go
to
the
skinner
trial
i
suppose
father
will
go
too
everybody
will
be
there
rejoined
teola
i
wonder
if
his
daughter
will
be
permitted
to
see
him
after
she
has
been
discovered
breaking
the
law
this
time
it
was
frederick
who
flushed
it
suddenly
dawned
upon
him
that
he
was
going
to
the
court
simply
to
see
the
squatter
girl
again
he
explained
his
embarrassment
by
exclaiming
poor
little
soul
she
is
the
loneliest
child
in
the
world
i
wish
we
could
do
something
for
her
father
would
let
us
put
in
teola
in
dismay
then
too
i
know
what
we
could
do
for
a
squatter
neither
do
i
that
the
problem
finished
frederick
and
after
he
was
gone
teola
mused
long
with
dan
jordan
in
her
mind
at
the
break
of
the
first
day
of
the
skinner
trial
smoke
could
be
seen
curling
up
from
the
chimney
of
tessibel
hut
a
candle
stood
in
the
window
flickering
its
smoky
flame
toward
the
light
streaks
in
the
east
from
the
lighthouse
to
the
ragged
rocks
the
lake
was
covered
with
the
ice
and
snow
of
an
early
winter
beyond
the
little
waves
curled
up
and
washed
over
the
frozen
masses
adhering
here
and
there
making
an
icy
fringe
along
the
edge
flocks
of
wild
ducks
fluttered
close
to
the
lake
surface
filling
the
morning
air
with
discordant
quacking
tessibel
had
not
forgotten
that
her
father
was
to
be
brought
that
day
before
his
accusers
she
had
made
elaborate
preparations
for
the
reception
of
her
dear
one
when
he
should
be
free
to
return
to
her
she
would
stay
in
the
shanty
during
the
trial
and
pray
daddy
was
playing
a
part
in
a
most
agonizing
drama
he
and
the
student
and
herself
were
the
principals
while
a
few
others
their
enemies
made
the
background
when
the
curtain
fell
tessibel
would
bring
daddy
home
to
the
hut
and
it
was
for
this
that
she
was
preparing
the
bed
had
been
dragged
from
the
wall
and
the
squatter
girl
was
sweeping
out
the
dust
of
ages
which
settled
again
upon
the
coats
and
among
the
webby
meshes
of
the
net
now
dry
and
shrunken
from
disuse
one
leg
was
missing
from
the
stove
but
three
red
bricks
shoved
under
the
side
did
the
work
of
the
broken
part
the
ancient
frying
pan
with
patches
of
grease
upon
it
suspended
itself
from
a
newly
driven
nail
in
the
wall
tess
had
learned
many
things
since
her
father
imprisonment
had
learned
that
a
girl
of
fifteen
could
run
barefooted
in
the
open
with
impunity
she
had
found
a
pair
of
daddy
old
boots
tied
rags
about
her
feet
and
clambered
into
them
how
like
a
woman
she
felt
with
covered
legs
true
the
water
gushed
in
through
the
holes
that
daddy
had
cut
in
the
soles
on
the
rocks
but
the
tops
were
whole
and
tess
looked
upon
them
with
pride
when
the
daylight
flooded
the
cabin
tess
blew
out
the
candle
and
viewed
her
work
with
delight
how
pleased
daddy
would
be
after
this
she
would
be
a
model
housekeeper
he
should
sleep
in
the
morning
until
she
had
prepared
his
breakfast
and
her
fingers
would
fly
in
the
summer
gathering
the
berries
and
fruit
to
make
more
money
so
that
he
should
not
run
risks
with
the
netting
that
first
day
of
waiting
seemed
interminably
long
but
tess
spent
it
happily
for
ever
vividly
into
her
mind
came
the
words
of
frederick
the
student
that
god
would
hear
and
answer
day
by
day
her
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
her
petitions
had
grown
upon
her
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
been
caught
by
daddy
enemies
in
her
nightly
scrambles
up
the
ivy
at
the
jail
god
had
answered
in
letting
her
see
her
father
so
many
times
at
the
end
of
her
midnight
walks
three
men
of
squatter
row
staggered
through
the
storm
up
the
lehigh
valley
tracks
they
passed
the
line
of
huts
making
an
occasional
comment
upon
the
inhabitants
of
some
lighted
shanty
it
was
the
evening
of
the
second
of
november
the
first
day
of
orn
skinner
trial
the
squatters
had
turned
out
in
great
numbers
to
see
how
the
humped
prisoner
looked
before
his
condemnation
for
all
believed
that
the
fisherman
would
hang
it
would
be
establishing
a
new
precedent
if
skinner
were
acquitted
and
ithaca
never
established
new
precedents
with
squatters
so
mused
the
men
as
they
sullenly
toiled
toward
home
each
satisfied
in
his
heart
that
if
skinner
went
the
way
of
others
from
the
row
it
would
be
but
another
act
of
revenge
upon
the
part
of
the
townspeople
for
had
not
one
and
every
witness
save
elias
graves
testified
that
day
to
the
good
character
of
the
accused

time
the
wind
crooning
its
endless
tune
through
the
telegraph
wires
as
they
passed
kennedy
pete
the
brindle
bulldog
howled
in
rage
at
not
being
able
to
attack
the
squatters
the
dog
snapped
viciously
at
all
strangers
and
more
than
this
would
he
have
done
if

had
had
an
opportunity
to
reach

these

an

at

lane

flickered
them
an
invitation
to

answered
their
knock
and
embarrassedly
offered
each
a
chair
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
it
ai
ended
she
faltered
with
a
hasty
glance
at
the
three
stolid
faces
the
post
of
daddy
bed
supporting
the
supple
young
form
replied
jake
brewer
ben
letts
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ventured
into
the
presence
of
tessibel
since
he
had
put
frederick
to
death
he
air
comin
home
then
there
was
a
question
in
the
pleading
voice
as
her
eyes
fell
first
upon
one
and
then
another
nope
grinned
ezry
he
air
to
be
took
away
tessibel
shrank
back
further
and
further
every
muscle
tired
in
its
agony
of
the
rotten
post
squeaked
loudly
bending
beneath
her
weight
and
over
her
in
lightning
rapidity
swept
the
shadow
of
the
rope
snatching
her
father
from
her
and
god
the
student
had
not
limited
the
power
of
the
cross
but
tess
had
discovered
its
limitations
in
ezra
longman
statement
limitations
that
made
her
quiver
with
pain
as
she
pictured
the
evil
thing
which
darkly
menaced
her
loved
one
he
air
a
damn
liar
burst
forth
jake
brewer
the
jedge
ai
said
no
words
what
ezy
says
he
has
tessibel
heard
and
understood
the
splendid
buoyant
youth
gathered
instantly
together
faith
in
the
eternal
promise
of
god
sweeping
over
her
once
more
she
might
have
known
that
daddy
was
safe
every
long
day
had
been
filled
with
petitions
hurled
at
the
feet
of
the
almighty
tess
in
her
ignorance
had
juggled
with
the
sacred
name
of
jehovah
expecting
the
fulfillment
of
her
prayers
just
as
a
boy
filled
with
ecstatic
faith
expects
his
ball
to
come
back
to
him
after
he
has
tossed
it
into
the
air
so
would
daddy
skinner
come
to
her
snatched
from
the
shadow
of
an
ignominious
death
through
some
miracle
of
god
goodness
it

over
she
stammered
holding
no
grudge
against
ezra
longman
for
his
untimely
joke
yep
then
he
air
comin
home
night
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
ben

looking
at

closed
one
red
lid
letting

fall
slowly
over

letts
brought
his
squint
gaze
back
to
tess
he
air
comin

night
she
repeated
questioningly
raising
her
voice
a
little
with
an
insistent
glance
at
each
fisherman
this
time
tess
read
denial
in
their
faces
but
smiled
radiantly
what
did
they
knew
about
it
what
did
fishermen
understand
of
the
student
god
of
the
faith
that
would
bring
daddy
home
to
her
in
spite
of
the
twelve
grim
men
and
all
her
father
enemies
in

she
consigned
the
beloved
humpbacked
father
to
him
who
held
the
worlds
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
ben
letts
still
gazed
steadily
at
tess
the
red
eyelids
opening
wider
and
wider
she
had
never
been
so
beautiful
before
during
the
past
two
months
the
girl
had
grown
into
a
woman
into
a
soulful
creature
whom
the
squatter
ben
ardently
desired
for
his
wife
ah
he
would
see
to
that
he
shoved
his
great
legs
up
and
down
before
him
tumbling
these
things
over
in
his
mind
the
taming
of
such
a
girl
would
be
his
vicious
delight
the
first
thing
to
do
would
be
to
ply
the
scissors
to
the
red
curls
ben
could
see
that
the
hair
was
clean
each
curl
clinging
lovingly
to
its
mate
yet
living
apart
so
different
from
the
matted
locks
of
the
tess
he
had
always
known
yer
daddy
got
good
and
mad
remarked
jake
brewer
abruptly
the
deadly
silence
grating
upon
his
nerves
what
about

tess
sharply
dominie
graves
were
in
the
and
said
as
how
yer
pap
were
a
wicked
daddy
of
a
wickeder
gal
and
the
jedge
made
him
tell
as
how
ye
was
so
cussed
and
yer
daddy
humps
riz
up
like
a
cat
back
wet
with
cold
tea
tess
waited
expectantly
and
the
dominie
said
as
how
ye
twiggled
yer

to
yer
nose
at
him
continued
jake
did
ye
the
pale
face
went
to
a
deep
crimson

remembered
the
day
well
the
dominie
had
caught
her
stealing
berries
and
like
all
the
weaker
ones
in
a
strife
tess
had
used
her
tongue
bitterly
and
had
twiggled
her
fingers
the
squatters
went
away
leaving
tessibel
with
a
new
feeling
of
shame
ben

went
with
reluctance
he
dared
not
remain
after

had
gone
the
way
of

incurred
the
penalties
of

chapter
xi
the
last
day
of
skinner
trial
found
tessibel
taking
her
lonely
way
toward
town
she
was
going
for
daddy
skinner
to
bring
him
home
to
a
shanty
which
she
thought
was
clean
although
the
ragged
curtain
still
flapped
its
tatters
over
a
dirty
window
and
the
cobwebs
hung
listlessly
from
daddy
skinner
unused
net
but
tess
had
done
her
best
and
her
heart
sang
with
delightful
expectancy
as
she
neared
the
dangerous
open
trestle
which
spanned
the
hoghole
gorge
when
she
turned
into
town
her
mind
was
at
work
with
the
thought
of
how
she
would
bring
daddy
triumphantly
through
the
row
of
squatter
huts
lead
him
even
through
the
streets
of
ithaca
her
vivid
imagination
played
with
the
scene
frederick
the
student
would
see
her
he
would
know
that
together
they
had
saved
the
dearest
life
ever
given
into
the
hands
of
a
jury
up
the
street
through
dewitt
park
and
into
the
little
lane
she
tramped
here
tessibel
halted
the
was
so
crowded
that
an
overflow
of
men
stood
in
the
street
with
overcoats
tightly
buttoned
stood
listening
for
the
words
that
would
satisfy
their
demands
orn
skinner
must
die
a
demonstration
of
joy
ringing
from
the
court
made
the
child
shiver
then
smile
not
even
the
wicked
jeering
of
daddy
enemies
could
shake
her
faith
in
the
student
word
twelve
jurors
sat
in
their
chairs
but
a
useless
set
of
men
for
a
unanimous
ban
of
death
had
been
pronounced
upon
the
fisherman
before
any
one
of
the
jury
had
taken
the
oath
some
of
the
evidence
did
not
reach
their
ears
for
they
were
thinking
of
other
things
the
man
of
two
humps
was
as
far
away
from
their
homes
or
their
hopes
as
the
rope
that
would
end
him
during
the
trial
the
prisoner
had
remained
silent
in
his
chair
with
a
stolidity
that
aroused
no
sympathy
for
him
not
once
was
he
seen
to
lift
his
eyes
to
the
judge
and
but
once
when
tess
was
being
maligned
by
dominie
graves
did
the
rise
and
fall
as
if
the
heart
beneath
were
beating
wildly
skinner
had
not
been
allowed
to
testify
in
his
own
defense
and
knowing
the
futility
of
it
he
had
not
insisted
upon
speaking
his
attorney
made
a
few
feeble
remarks
which
because
of
the
indifference
and
his
disbelief
in
his
client
fell
without
effect
the
prosecuting
attorney
took
but
ten
minutes
to
sum
up
the
case
telling
the
jury
that
they
knew
their
duty
too
well
for
him
to
attempt
to
instruct
them
but
said
he
i
will
add
one
word
of
your
own
convictions
these
people
have
infested
our
beautiful
city
sapping
its
life
like
a
great
pest
the
law
is
nothing
to
them
human
life
less
there
is
one
thing
gentlemen
of
the
jury
of
which
they
stand
in
awe
and
it
is
in
your
hands
to
give
them
one
more
lesson
that
one
thing
they
fear
is
the
rope
he
sat
down
amid
a
dense
silence
the
judge
spoke
shortly
and
the
twelve
jurors
filed
out
past
the
stooping
prisoner
who
seemed
to
care
so
little
that
he
did
not
look
upon
them
as
they
went
twenty
minutes
elapsed
and
the
court
officer
announced
in
stentorian
tones
that
the
verdict
had
been
reached
solemnly
the
twelve
men
seated
themselves
whilst
an
expectant
flutter
passed
over
the
room

grizzled
head
settled
itself
back
between

two
pulsing
humps

steady
eyes
under

shaggy
brows
looking
out
for
the
first
time
in

innocent

in

a

the
of

sunk
the
large

between
the

of

hiding

under
its

when

still
stood
with

on

thought

there
any
reason
why

sentence

court
should
not

pronounced
upon

the
fisherman
turned
his
piercing
eyes
upon
the
judge
but
attempted
not
to
speak
orn
skinner
the
judge
was
interrupted
there
was
a
disturbing
commotion
in
the
back
of
the
he
lifted
his
gavel
for
silence
his
gaze
falling
upon
a
dripping
shivering
girl
who
raised
to
his
face
a
pair
of
eyes
in
which
shone
a
soul
the
magnitude
of
which
the
judge
could
not
fathom
with
all
his
dignity
orn

he
finished
turning
again
to
the
fisherman
twelve

first
degree

court
then

its
sentence
upon

until

the
ponderous
form
of
the
doomed
man
straightened
as
though
unafraid
whilst
the
commotion
increased
tess
was
madly
tearing
her
way
through
detaining
hands
once
free
she
started
up
the
aisle
the
most
ridiculous
little
figure
ever
seen
in
ithaca
the
red
hair
was
in
curls
to
the
girl
hips
the
young
form
covered
with
but
a
calico
blouse
confined
about
the
waist
by
a
piece
of
hemp
rope
four
huge
thorns
held
together
the
edges
of
a
rent
down
the
center
of
the
skirt
which
came
just
above
the
knees
daddy
skinner
cowhide
boots
lifting
themselves
under
the
hem
every
one
save
him
whom
she
loved
was
unseen
by
tess
and
everything
unheard
save
the
terrible
sentence
of
death
the
wrinkles
settled
out
of
the
wan
little
face
a
smile
brightened
the
brown
eyes
and
dimpled
the
tender
twitching
mouth
altering
the
woful
expression
for
what
was
the
mandate
of
an
earthly
judge
compared
to
the
majestic
promise
of
heaven
the
student
had
said
but
her
smiling
eyes
fell
for
a
moment
on
those
of
frederick
graves
the
boy
partly
rose
but
sank
back
again
white
to
the
ears
a
picture
of
mental
suffering
here
through
the
silence
came
a
shock

the

desecrating

daddy

was
standing
outside
the
railing
close
to
his
attorney
guarded
by
a
deputy
his
fierce
eyes
turned
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
the
sight
of
his
beloved
snapped
them
shut
like
a
vise
the
old
beard

shaggy
and
unkempt
trembled
whilst
a
parched
tongue
licked
over
the

and
tessibel
sang

descended
upon

and
for
a
moment
the

of

tried
to

eyelids
open

singing
ceased

she
spoke

without

through

she
had
so
lately
sung

way
a
man
stepped
into
her
path

up
and

before

face

the

scanned
each

faces
with
intensity
there
was
dumb
pleading
in
the
one
gaze
and
hard
supremacy
in
the
other
a
spasmodic
tremor
ran
over
the
spectators
tess
had
struck
a
note
of
tragedy
in
the
affair
which
had
been
overlooked
by
the
thoughtless
throng
the

looking
at

frown

on

gasped
as

twenty
young
people
had
gathered
for
the
toffy

at
minister
graves
tess
was
the
topic
of
conversation
every
one
was
eager
to
talk
of
the
action
in
the
that
day
my
mother
says
chimed
in
a
pretty
girl
that
when
that
skinner
girl
walked
up
through
the
court
room
she
sounded
like
a
horse
trotting
along
she
had
on
a
pair
of
man
boots
that
why
said
another
but
she
has
a
beautiful
voice

she
this
question
was
directed
to
frederick

yes
he
assented
flushing
to
his
line
and
besides
a
beautiful
voice
broke
in
richard
hall
she
has
a
mighty
pretty
face
and
such
hair
if
she
had
been
crying
and
had
so
many
people
around
her
i
should
have
spoken
to
her
she
worth
consoling
a
sharp
pang
of
jealousy
shot
through
frederick
heart
that
another
should
make
lighter
the
burdens
of
the
squatter
girl
filled
him
with
unrest
a
pleading
face
flashed
across
his
vision
and
tessibel
voice
rang
anew
in
his
ears
he
was
living
over
again
the
moments
spent
in
the
cabin
and
his
heart
thrilled
at
the
memory
of
the
momentary
glance
sent
to
him
over
the
heads
of
the
spectators

the
crowded

she
her
eyes
were
upon

he
rose
quickly
to
his
feet
and
followed
the
girl
smilingly
to
the
kitchen
i
wanted
you
to
help

it
ready
teola
said

i
glad

the

low
over
the
brown
mixture
in
the
kettle
your
eyes
did

dan
did
you
notice
that
none
of
the
other
boys
got
up
when
you
spoke
his
glance
filled
with
merriment
as
he
went
on
i
think
too
that
i
should
have
been
a
little
jealous
if
anyone
else
had
helped
you
and
your
hands
are
so
strong
murmured
teola
you
only
wanted
my
hands

the
boy

to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
face

had
wanted
me
for
some
other
teola
stood
with
the
long
wooden
spoon
twirling
in
her
fingers
i
did
want
you
for
yourself
dan
and
then
she
stopped
and
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
click
click
click
of
the
toffy
as
it
snapped
to
and
fro
in
the
huge
fingers
of
the
student
i
mighty
glad
that
i
chose
cornell
for
my
college
broke
in
the
boy
presently
i
thought
first
of
going
to
yale
and
you
pleased
too
teola
that
i
came
to
ithaca
are
you
very
glad
came
the
low
voice
distinctly
and
i
never
been
so
ambitious
in
all
my
life
as
i
have
since
been
here
and
known
you
and
i
was
wondering
if
if
frederick
voice
broke
off
the
words
his
big
form
loomed
in
the
doorway
before
dan
could
finish
his
sentence
have
you
kids
finished
that
toffy
better
let
me
help
too
there
was
a
noticeable
tremor
in
teola
voice
as
she
replied
we
finished
frederick
and
you
can
carry
the
butter
and
those
plates
i
something
important
to
tell
you
teola
whispered
dan
the
girl
did
not
answer
but
the
student
knew
that
she
would
listen
to
him
in
some
future
time
the
was
festooned
with
evergreens
and
winter
ferns
wound
here
and
there
with
streamers
of
ribbons
two
large
lamps
one
in
the
window
and
the
other
on
a
table
near
the
door
sent
forth
their
light
through
red
shades
glass
dishes
filled
with
apples
and
golden
oranges
decorated
the
top
of
the
piano
and
surrounded
the
lamps
when
dan
and
teola
left
the
kitchen
both
flushed
with
the
first
emotions
of
their
youthful
hearts
there
came
to
them
gurgles
of
girlish
laughter
intermingled
now
and
then
with
the
loud
voice
of
some
merry
happy
boy
after
two
hours
of
strenuous
the
tired
young
revellers
sat
down
to
plates
heaped
with
goodies
just
at
this
juncture
a
ring
of
the
pealed
through
the
house
a
silence
fell
over
the
company
and
a
sound
of
altercation
came
to
them
distinctly
suddenly
the
door
burst
violently
open
and
a
spectacle
in
strange
contrast
to
the
cheery
scene
about
them
flashed
upon
the
eyes
of
the
young
people
a
girl
unkempt
and
dripping
wild
anxiety
portrayed
upon
her
face
stood
in
the
doorway
there
was
not
the
slightest
embarrassment
in
her
glance
as
her
peculiar
eyes
traveled
the
lines
of
boys
and
girls
sitting
round
the
wall
when
at
last
they
fell
on
frederick
she
took
an
impetuous
step
toward
him
a
brilliant
smile
lighting
the
wan
face
stupefaction
rested
upon
the
student
as
he
recognized
tessibel
skinner
it
air
time
to
pray
said
she
looking
straight
at
him
as
he
slowly
rose
from
his
chair
daddy
skinner
air
to
be
took
away
unless
yer
god
stops
the
rope
every
word
was
distinct
unless
god
would
stay
the
rope
the
words
repeated
themselves
over
in
the
boy
brain
and
his
face
deepened
in
color
it
was
the
beautiful
faith
of
the
wild
untaught
young
girl
with
the
hot
blood
rushing
in
her
veins
that
called
forth
the
flush
his
heart
sickened
with
his
own
lack
of
confidence
in
god
he
was
to
preach
of
a
crucified
saviour
but
no
such
faith
and
hope
as
this
of
tessibel
skinner
would
aid
him
he
was
even
now
ashamed
of
the
girl
in
cowhide
boots
and
torn
thin
skirt
as
these
thoughts
floated
past
him
he
saw
the
young
squatter
wither
under
a
giggle
from
a
girl
in
the
corner
look
at
her
feet
were
the
words
that
changed
tessibel
frankness
to
embarrassment
her
eager
pathos
to
wofulness
tessibel
shrank
close
to
the
door
for
the
first
time
realizing
how
out
of
place
she
was
i
were
i
were
a
fool
to
come
but
but
the
earnestness
of
the
vibrant
voice
the
proud
appealing
young
face
moved
frederick
to
pity
and
it
was
right
you
should
have
come
said
he
gently
taking
her
hands
and
no
one
dare
question
your
privilege
to
ask
a
prayer
for
your
father
still
retaining
her
fingers
in
his
he
turned
explaining
this
is
miss
skinner
whose
father
is
suffering
now
from
a
stroke
of
the
law
we
who
have
fathers
and
mothers
whom
we
love
must
wish
her
well
tessibel
sank
down
down
among
her
boots
and
rags
his
words
reducing
her
to
tears
teola
came
to
her
brother
side
she
had
never
before
been
actually
in
the
presence
of
a
squatter
for
when
they
had
brought
fish
and
berries
to
the
back
door
her
mother
had
always
ordered
the
children
to
the
front
of
the
house
but
now
filled
with
sympathy
she
stooped
down
and
placed
her
hand
upon
tessibel
head
the
touch
was
so
gentle
that
the
fishermaid
lifted
her
eyes
to
see
who
sorrowed
with
her
the
squatter
covered
the
white
fingers
with
tears
and
kisses
then
she
struggled
to
her
feet
the
nails
in
daddy
boots
scraping
the
polished
floor
making
long
white
marks
to
tessibel
there
were
no
other
persons
in
the
room
save
frederick
and
his
beautiful
sister
she
made
a
queer
upward
movement
with
her
head
wiping
the
tears
away
with
the
tattered
sleeve
i
was
afeared
ye
forget
daddy
skinner
she
murmured
the
big
man
from
the
hill
said
like
you
did
and
i
says
it
air
prayin
time
and
i
comed
she
had
forgotten
the
tears
of
a
few
minutes
before
forgotten
that
twenty
pairs
of
searching
youthful
eyes
watched
her
every
movement
and
mentally
criticized
her
from
the
masses
of
long
hair
to
the
boots
on
her
feet
she
only
remembered
the
student
that
he
was
smiling
into
her
eyes
and
that
his
sister
too
teola
graves
had
sympathized
with
her
with
a
radiant
grateful
smile
she
turned
to
go
the
door
opening
under
her
eager
grasp
it
was
here
that
dan
jordan
spoke
wo
miss
skinner
have
some
coffee
tessibel
looked
at
him
with
an
incredulous
glance
he
too
had
come
forward
and
stood
with
his
kindly
gray
eyes
fixed
upon
her
face
yes
yes
of
course
hurriedly
put
in
teola
pardon
me
i
forgot
you
shall
have
my
cup
here
tessibel
i
may
call
you
that
may
i
please
drink
some
of
mine
teola
held
the
cup
invitingly
to
the
shivering
lips
and
tessibel
swallowed
it
down
in
one
gulp
i
air
goin
now
she
said
desperately
wiping
away
coffee
drops
that
lingered
upon
her
face
and
ye
ai
goin
to
forget
this
last
was
to
frederick
and
he
shook
his
head
emphatically
he
would
not
forget
again
he
would
make
the
girl
father
a
special
medium
to
establish
a
line
of
faith
between
the
god
he
professed
to
love
and
himself
the
quality
of
which
should
be
no
less
than
the
one
that
tessibel
had
cultivated
during
her
weary
weeks
of
waiting
no
thought
entered
anyone
mind
of
asking
the
girl
if
she
were
afraid
of
the
dark
night
she
seemed
so
much
a
part
of
the
darkness
of
the
falling
snow
and
thrashing
trees
that
she
was
allowed
to
depart
without
a
question
as
he
stood
on
the
rectory
steps
the
clicking
of
the
big
boots
came
to
frederick
long
after
the
slender
form
had
disappeared
from
sight
after
that
the
party
broke
up
for
the
merriment
had
died
in
grief
an
impression
had
been
made
upon
the
thoughtless
boys
and
girls
and
a
shadow
rested
on
each
face
as
they
bade
to
their
young
hostess
she
the
prettiest
girl
i
ever
saw
confided
teola
to
frederick
afterward
her
eyes
are
the
color
of
a
marigold
in
her
heart
teola
was
glad
that
she
had
gone
to
the
squatter
in
sympathy
for
upon
leaving
dan
jordan
had
whispered
words
that
had
burned
deep
into
her
soul
you
are
an
angel
teola
and
i
love
you
for
one
instant
the
tall
student
had
bent
his
head
laying
his
lips
upon
hers
and
had
gone
without
another
word
chapter
xiii
the
last
day
of
the
trial
was
so
different
from
that
of
dreams
again
she
must
cross
the
dark
hoghole
trestle
alone
on
her
way
to
the
hut
but
the
singing
in
her
heart
when
she
left
the
rectory
took
away
the
pain
of
her
loneliness
frederick
graves
had
said
that
she
had
done
right
in
coming
to
him
and
asking
prayers
for
daddy
skinner
her
faith
in
the
student
carried
her
above
the
material
things
of
the
earth
more
than
her
absolute
faith
in
god
for
like
women
tessibel
lived
and
had
faith
through
the
man
of
her
choice
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
she
passed
kennedy
wheat
field
in
which
capered
pete
the
brindle
bulldog
she
called
to
him
softly
pronouncing
his
name
twice
in
loving
resonance
which
brought
a
low
pleased
howl
from
the
coarse
throat
of
the
dog
but
the
exhausted
did
not
wait
to
touch
the
long
red
tongue
as
pete
thrust
his
nose
through
the
fence
she
passed
quickly
down
the
lane
to
her
father
hut
turning
the
corner
of
the
mud
cellar
she
saw
dimly
a
man
form
leaning
against
the
shanty
door
her
eyes
were
accustomed
to
marking
correctly
through
the
darkness
and
it
took
tess
but
a
moment
to
ascertain
that
the
lounging
figure
was
ben
letts
in
an
instant
the
first
real
fear
she
had
ever
felt
swept
over
her
and
she
drew
back
into
the
shadows
as
a
child
she
had
fled
from
this
man
because
he
tantalized
her
as
a
woman
she
dreaded
him
more
than
any
reptile
that
came
from
the
earth
the
man
hearing
footsteps
raised
his
head
the
silence
continuing
he
dropped
it
again
thinking
he
had
been
mistaken
and
resumed
his
former
position
of
waiting
tessibel
wondered
if
she
should
go
bravely
forward
insist
that
the
shanty
was
hers
and
that
he
should
go
away
the
mud
cellar
was
between
her
and
the
waiting
man
and
as
she
peered
closer
to
see
if
ben
were
still
there
one
brilliant
tangle
of
hair
fell
over
her
shoulder
ben
letts
caught
the
movement
and
tessibel
knew
it
alert
as
a
young
deer
she
turned
and
fled
back
up
the
lane
boots
impeded
her
speed
and
one
after
the
other
she
kicked
them
off
she
could
hear
the
man
running
after
her
shouting
his
rage
into
her
tingling
ears
he
was
gaining
upon
the
girl
and
commanded
her
to
stop
if
i
get
my
claws
on
ye
once
he
growled
it
be
bad
for
ye
tessibel
heard
and
flew
faster
there
was
no
one
to
help
her
and
her
only
salvation
lay
in
her
own
two
sturdy
little
legs
and
bruised
feet
she
reached
the
tracks
but
did
not
dare
run
the
ties
she
might
trip
in
the
darkness
and
nothing
could
save
her
from
her
enemy
her
eyes
strained
with
convulsive
fright
lifted
one
moment
to
the
sky
and
her
glance
fell
directly
upon
the
giant
pine
whose
branches
formed
the
image
of
her
fantastic
god
her
lips
fell
apart
with
a
gasp
she
fancied
her
deity
sent
her
an
assurance
of
aid
goddy
goddy
was
her
petition
for
the
love
of
yer
christ
and
the
student
suddenly
out
upon
the
air
rang
the
voice
of
one
of
tessibel
friends
the
brindle
bulldog
from
kennedy
farm
had
heard
the
unequal
race
with
short
tail
raised
his
fat
neck
bristling
with
stubby
hair
he
started
for
the
tracks
as
tess
did
for
the
fence
when
she
heard
his
growl
as
the
girl
came
on
and
on
the
dog
bounded
along
the
ground
toward
her
tess
opened
her
lips
and
spoke
sharply
and
a
pleased
bark
came
in
response
god
had
heard
and
answered
her
one
wild
leap
in
the
air
and
the
sound
of
tearing
clothes
as
her
already
tattered
skirt
came
in
contact
with
the
barbed
wire
and
tess
was
crouching
down
in
the
of
the
brindle
bull
the
dog
whirled
frantically
around
licking
her
face
fear
weakened
her
tongue
she
could
not
speak
only
little
spasmodic
sobs
burst
from
the
parted
lips
she
caught
the
huge
dog
to
her
breast
and
waited
ben
letts
was
on
the
tracks
she
could
hear
his
big
chest
heaving
with
breath
he
halted
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
pete
scented
an
enemy
and
straightened
out
his
strong
muscles
like
whip
cords
a
hoarse
growl
coming
from
between
his
jaws
ben
leaned
over
the
fence
with
an
oath
ye
better
come
away
from
him
he
grunted
threateningly
ye
air
thinking
the
brute
can
save
ye
but
i
put
a
bullet
through
his
pate
tessibel
knew
that
the
man
had
no
rifle
with
him
and
by
the
time
he
could
get
one
she
and
the
dog
would
be
far
away
her
mind
worked
fast
under
the
pressure

demanded

the
brindle
bulldog
lifted
his
head
again
and
sent
a
low
snarl
in
the
direction
of
the
fisherman
ben
in
his
rage
had
come
too
close
to
the
fence
the
animal
warning
sent
him
back

her
arms
around
the
dog
neck
banking
the
red
curls
under
her
cheek
for
a
pillow
it
was
good
to
rest
with
her
friend
between
the
fence
wires
she
could
see
the
branches
of
the
pine
tree
its
shadowy
arms
creating
odd
figures
across
the
light
streaks
in
the
sky
what
a
wonderful
being
the
student

was
he
had
listened
to
the
cry

mournfully
a

to
a
cry

without
a
sound
ben
rose
from
the
tracks
reached
for
a
stone
and
whirled
it
through
the
fence
at
tessibel
the
stone
missed
her
but
struck
the
dog
trembling
with
rage
pete
lifted
his
great
body
with
a
low
vicious
growl
tessibel
sprang
from
the
ground
whilst
another
stone
hurtled
through
the
air
catching
her
curls
in
its
flight
then
she
lifted
the
lower
wire
of
the
barbed
fence
pete
crouched
and
wiggled
his
flattened
body
through
ben
had
expected
this
he
turned
and
ran
the
skurrying
legs
of
the
dog
carried
him
quickly
on
after
the
fisherman
while
ben
screeching
like
a
great
night
owl
hooted
out
his
fear
of
the
maddened
dog
and
yelled
for
tess
to
call
him
off
the
girl
did
not
speak
only
waited
waited
until
a
louder
cry
from
the
hunted
man
assured
her
that
pete
had
gripped
him
tessibel
scarcely
dared
breathe
her
friend
god
earthly
instrument
sent
to
save
her
and
her
mortal
enemy
were
in
deadly
combat
ben
cries
had
ceased
but
the
listening
girl
could
hear
the
two
bodies
as
they
turned
over
and
over
beyond
on
the
tracks
and
rolled
into
the
ditch
her
feet
were
nearly
frozen
but
she
gathered
them
under
her
skirt
and
dumbly
waited
then
came
no
sound
there
was
nothing
but
a
deathly
silence
in
the
dim
shadows
near
the
land
would
she
ever
see
either
ben
or
the
dog
again
there
was
no
danger
that
pete
would
ben
she
called
loudly
leaning
over
the
fence
no
answer
came
from
the
deep
trench
by
the
railroad
bed
pete
pete
come
to
tessibel
come
to
tessibel
out
of
the
blackness
came
the
dog
his
head
hanging
low
the
angry
sparkle
in
his
eyes
quenched
tess
raised
the
wire
once
more
for
pete
body
to
wriggle
under
the
girl
shouted
anxiously
for
ben
but
no
answer
came
to
her
call
crouching
beside
pete
tessibel
reasoned
out
a
way
of
escape
if
she
took
the
brindle
bulldog
to
the
hut
with
her
she
would
be
safe
from
ben
were
he
lurking
about
she
propped
the
lower
wire
of
the
fence
high
with
a
stick
so
that
pete
could
reach
kennedy
barn
on
the
hill
again
when
she
sent
him
home
together
the
girl
and
the
bristling
pete
slid
silently
to
the
railroad
tracks
tessibel
holding
tightly
to
the
collar
some
fifty
feet
beyond
he
twisted
his
heavy
neck
set
forth
his
huge
jaw
and
refused
to
move
beside
the
track
was
a
long
dark
object
it
was
undeniably
unquestionably
quiet
tess
tugged
at
the
dog
collar
and
dragged
him
resisting
from
the
spot
down
the
lane
ran
the
squatter
and
the
dog
with
no
pause
save
to
pick
up
the
cowhide
boots
from
the
side
of
the
path
where
tess
had
cast
them
in
the
mad
race
she
clasped
the
head
of
pete
as
she
opened
the
hut
door
ye
can
come
in
too
pete
she
whispered
lifting
the
ugly
head
and
go
home
in
the
morning
tessibel
locked
the
door
but
did
not
light
a
candle
slipping
her
wet
clothes
to
the
floor
she
crawled
into
daddy
bed
and
with
the
forgetfulness
of
youth
sank
into
a
sleep
chapter
xiv
the
next
morning
after
her
encounter
with
ben
letts
tess
sat
up
in
bed
wondering
what
had
happened
then
she
remembered
one
slant
ray
of
sun
breaking
through
the
dirty
curtain
showed
that
the
day
was
far
advanced
she
jumped
out
of
bed
opened
the
door
and
allowed
pete
to
scamper
away
after
kindling
a
fire
and
frying
a
fish
she
sat
down
to
eat
suddenly
a
knock
on
the
door
startled
her
ben

after
his
lesson
of
the
night

tessibel

more
than

so
had
tessibel
and
myra
been
brought
up
to
believe
the
squatter
women
fawned
at
the
feet
of
their
brutal
husbands
as
a
beaten
dog
cringes
to
its
master
that
ben
letts
had
broken
myra
arm
on
the
ragged
rocks
and
yet
the
girl
wanted
to
aid
him
showed
tess
the
superiority
of
the
male
sex
and
myra
loved
the
fisherman
she
evidenced
it
in
every
action
the
lips
of
the
younger
squatter
were
sealed
about
the
trail
which
she
herself
had
laid
in
the
midnight
tragedy
but
through
the
tender
young
heart
flashed
the
hope
that
the
experience
with
the
dog
would
cause
ben
letts
to
turn
his
face
toward
the
wretched
shrunken
creature
who
had
suffered
so
much
through
him
she
contemplated
myra
an
instant
do
ye
want
me
to
see
him
she
asked
rising
yep
replied
myra
the
dull
eyes
filled
with
a
momentary
sparkle

over

against

forced
the
girls
to
take
the
path
through
the
wood
to
the
hill
beyond
until
they
came
in

and
fought
for

cloth
the
salt
tears
scorching
the
rents
in
the
skin
as
they
rolled
hot
from
the
red
eye
and
soaked
into

plasters

squatter
girl
mechanically
wiped

was
moving
about
in
the
loft
overhead
when
the
two
girls
entered
the
shanty
tess
went
to
the
wooden
box
and
looked
down
upon
the
small
pinched
face
of
the
sleeping
infant
the
babe
had
worn
out
his
little
lungs
screeching
in
his
pain
the
small
faded
eyes
rolling
backward

the
young

quietly
to

she

the
babe

in
the
cradle
and
tessibel
took
him
up
the
glorious
voice
hushed
the
child
to
sleep
myra
longman
bitterly
scanning
the
beautiful
face
there
were
only
two
years
between
her
and
tessibel
and
her

poor
ghastly
wrinkled
face
looked
years
older
if

were

the
splendid
vigor
of

youth

new
expression
in

eyes

to

his
lovin
for

chapter
xv
that
evening
minister
graves
came
blustering
in
after
his
family
were
seated
at
the
table
what
was
this
ridiculous
thing
that
he
had
heard
his
home
disgraced
his
position
ruined
his
children
ostracized
he
glanced
at
teola
and
frederick
his
wife
fastening
babe
napkin
under
the
child
chin
remonstrated
why
father
what
the
trouble
i
was
making
a
clerical
call
on
robman
fumed
the
dominie
and
that
girl
of
hers
and
a
saucy
one
she
is
too
burst
into
the
room
and
mother
what
tale
do
you
think
she
told
before
us
frederick
glanced
at
his
sister
but
teola
eyes
were
upon
her
empty
plate
graves
shook
her
head
that
that
skinner
girl
came
here
last
night
and
in
all
her
rags
and
filth
drank
coffee
from
our
daughter
cup
madame
did
you
ever
imagine
that
such
a
disgrace
could
fall
upon
you
graves
looked
helplessly
from
her
husband
distorted
face
to
her
son
and
daughter
she
came
into
your
home
went
on
the
minister
and
was
asked
to
take
refreshments
from
your
cups
robman
said
that
she
disliked
to
think
that
such
degraded
guests
were
allowed
in
your
home
do
you
understand
what
that
means
mrs
graves
let
frederick
explain
father
pleaded
the
trembling
wife
he
was
going
to
speak
and
you
stopped
him
what
and
how
did
it
happen
the
girl
came
to
the
rectory
to
ask
prayers
for
her
father
said
frederick
an
expression
darkening
his
eyes
which
his
mother
dreaded
prayers
prayers
roared
the
minister
prayers
for
a
squatter
and
a
murderer
and
drinking
coffee
from
your
cups
such
a
disgrace
can
never
be
lifted
from
this
house
what
hurt
did
she
do
irreverently
asked
babe
frederick
was
thankful
for
the
child
frank
question
hurt
harm
you
mean
if
she
should
just
hurt
a
person
that
could
be
mended
harm
was
what
she
did
what
harm
persisted
babe
madam
you
see
your
children
are
all
growing
up
like
heathens
there
ar
any
of
the
parents
whose
sons
and
daughters
were
here
last
night
who
wo
think
a
long
time
before
they
allow
them
to
come
again
you
understand
do
you
that
that
squatter
covered
with
germs
of
all
kinds
drank
from
your
daughter
cup
graves
started
preceptibly
she
was
noted
for
a
fear
of
germs
teola
your
mouth
must
be
scoured
with
peroxide
oh
if
some
one
would
only
tell
me
how
it
all
happened
frederick
rose
from
his
chair
and
impulsively
laid
his
hand
on
his
mother
shoulder
to
teola
he
looked
so
tall
and
strong
so
capable
of
explaining
that
she
rose
too
i
will
tell
you
mother
said
the
student
the
girl
was
in
distress
in
some
way
she
had
been
led
to
believe
that
prayers
effective
prayers
could
bring
about
any
desired
result
she
simply
came
to
ask
us
to
pray
for
her
father
teola
was
by
his
side
now
reassuringly
pressing
his
arm
and
where
would
she
go
she
broke
in
suddenly
if
not
to
a
home
the
pastor
whole
family
at
least
the
members
that
had
been
submissive
for
babe
had
always
challenged
her
father
commands
was
rising
against
him
his
wife
instead
of
taking
her
willful
children
to
task
was
weeping
his
son
and
daughter
stood
beside
her
refuting
every
word
he
said
he
brought
down
his
hand
with
a
bang
his
eyes
narrowing
into
a
slit
you
will
every
one
do
as
i
say
he
cried
frederick
you
are
to
stay
away
from
classes
for
two
days
your
professors
knowing
that
you
have
disobeyed
your
father
if
your
fellow
students
ask
you
why
you
are
absent
you
must
tell
them
what
i
have
said
and
you
teola
frederick
stopped
the
rush
of
words
if
i
stay
away
from
college
two
days
he
said
in
a
low
tone
so
deliberate
that
every
word
burned
into
the
mother
brain
i
shall
never
go
back
again
i
am
no
longer
a
child
and
i
wo
be
punished
and
what
is
more
i
shall
leave
your
home
forever
you
may
take
your
choice
father
but
not
until
i
make
another
statement
the
girl
from
the
lake
asked
me
to
pray
for
her
that
is
my
intention
and
i
shall
do
more
if
possible
i
shall
use
every
bit
of
influence
i
have
to
aid
her
father
to
escape
hanging
also
if
you
punish
teola
you
will
never
see
me
again
graves
had
risen
from
her
chair
she
walked
straight
to
her
son
placed
her
hand
upon
him
frederick
you
would
leave
your
mother
the
strong
arm
pressed
about
the
wearied
little
form
reassuringly
and
you
can
bet
papa
graves
put
in
babe
that
i
go
with
mamma
any
old
day
that
what
i
will
teola
stood
irresolutely
looking
first
at
frederick
then
at
her
father
she
went
toward
the
minister
and
almost
whispered
father
let
me
speak
the
girl
came
without
having
been
invited
by
anyone
and
she
did
not
stay
five
minutes
she
was
drenched
through
and
cold
i
gave
her
my
cup
of
coffee
and
she
stated
her
errand
and
went
away
the
minister
rose
leaving
his
supper
untouched
put
on
his
overcoat
not
one
remonstrating
word
coming
from
his
family
and
went
out
pastor
graves
made
his
way
up
the
town
through
the
main
street
to
his
hunger
having
died
in
his
anger
and
amazement
he
was
positive
that
he
could
have
brought
his
children
to
terms
had
not
their
mother
taken
sides
with
them
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
early
days
of
his
married
life
when
nothing
had
disturbed
their
peace
the
children
obeyed
and
graves
thought
her
husband
word
the
essence
of
all
law
he
turned
into
the
in
the
middle
of
the
block
here
met
nearly
every
evening
the
head
ones
of
his
flock
for
a
little
while
to
talk
over
religion
and
politics
outsiders
called
it
the
amen
corner
of
ithaca
ah
exclaimed
the
druggist
you
early
graves
must
have
had
your
supper
at
the
going
down
of
the
sun
graves
coughed
his
embarrassment
and
sat
down
feeling
sick
elias
the
druggist
opened
the
door
for
a
child
to
pass
out
no
not
ill
only
disgusted
with
the
world
in
general
skinner
girl
coming
to
the
court
went
against
your
notions
eh
and
every
one
else
with
any
sense
snapped
graves
professor
young
stopped
in
here
on
his
way
up
the
hill
resumed
bates
he
had
been
over
to
the
jail
talking
to
skinner
and
he
says
that
the
man
will
be
murdered
if
the
state
hangs
him
that
all
young
knows
about
it
growled
the
minister
you
and
i
know
these
people
bates
better
then
young
does
and
skinner
word
worth
the
powder
to
blow
it
up
with
bates
took
his
accustomary
position
on
the
stool
and
spread
his
long
hands
out
on
his
knees
well
the
professor
says
he
went
on
that
skinner
can
prove
that
he
did
use
the
gun
how
can
he
prove
it
asked
graves
sharply
only
by
the
oaths
of
men
with
no
more
veracity
than
he
has
i
would
believe
one
of
those
squatters
if
he
used
the
sacred
oath
twenty
times
over
maybe
the
next
jury
will
think
differently
argued
the
druggist
bigger
fools
they
then
interrupted
graves
i
do
know
what
the
town
is
coming
to
if
the
fishermen
can
shoot
down
our
officials
without
even
remonstrance
i
tell
you
what
bates
there
be
a
city
war
over
skinner
let
young
take
up
the
cudgel
and
i
see
what
the
church
can
do
there
power
in
the
pulpit
i
can
tell
you
that
bates
agreed
to
this
if
the
citizens
of
this
city
continued
the
minister
encouraged
by
the
evident
acquiescence
of
the
druggist
should
take
this
matter
up
as
a
body
ten
men
like
young
could
bring
about
skinner
acquittal
i
not
so
sure
muttered
bates
i
sure
insisted
graves
strenuously
very
sure
for
if
to
a
man
every
one
is
ready
to
do
his
duty
what
kind
of
a
jury
could
they
have
like
yesterday
conviction
swift
and
sure
but
objected
the
druggist
a
juror
who
takes
his
oath
in
a
murder
case
must
know
little
or
nothing
of
it
men
would
not
be
accepted
if
for
a
week
or
month
they
had
listened
to
combative
sermons
against
the
prisoner
and
you
certainly
would
have
a
juror
perjure
himself
would
you
graves
the
district
attorney
is
no
fool
replied
the
minister
softening
his
argument
under
the
shocked
expression
of
bates
he
knows
when
the
state
is
to
be
benefited
by
the
outcome
of
a
trial
he
can
leave
off
certain
questions
it
has
been
done
i
know
it
interrupted
bates
but
it
seems
hardly
fair
just
then
the
door
opened
and
silas
jones
the
richest
man
in
the
town
took
his
seat
with
the
other
two
ameners
the
fascinating
subject
of
the
day
the
unusualness
of
the
squatter
trial
and
the
girl
with
the
singing
voice
continued
to
be
the
topic
of
conversation
minister
graves
family
in
standing
out
against
him
in
a
matter
so
near
his
heart
only
strengthened
his
desire
to
see
the
end
as
he
wished
it
to
be
the
sentence
of
yesterday
executed
against
the
fisherman
without
another
trial
young
lost
his
senses
do
you
think
so
silas
he
asked
well
drawled
jones
if
skinner
did
commit
willful
murder
hate
to
see
him
hang
it
would
do
any
harm
as
i
see
to
give
him
another
chance
you
change
your
mind
in
church
next
sunday
commented
the
parson
i
going
to
show
every
man
his
duty
clear
and
plain
he
brought
down
his
hand
upon
his
knee
with
an
egotistical
slap
all
folks
do
think
the
same
way
you
do
dominie
persisted
jones
now
then
bill
hopkins
of
the
toggery
shop
he
do
believe
in
women
speakin
in
meetin
the
minister
distinctly
remembered
this
more
than
once
had
he
taken
the
delinquent
bill
hopkins
to
task
for
taking
his
letter
to
another
church
but
bill
could
not
be
induced
to
return
because
the
creed
had
not
been
followed
by
its
members
nor
enforced
by
the
shepherd
of
the
flock
hopkins
was
the
man
in
the
whole
county
and
his
voice
went
far
when
he
spoke
but
for
over
a
year
his
place
among
the
ameners
had
been
vacant
also
his
pew
in
graves
church
the
dominie
needed
such
men
as
bill
in
his
congregation
if
he
would
win
his
fight
against
the
squatters
these
thoughts
were
prominent
in
his
mind
when
the
door
admitted
a
great
gust
of
wind
and
the
famous
bill
hopkins
the
parson
caught
his
breath
bill
spoke
a
genial
shook
hands
around
and
bought
a
small
bottle
of
some
camphor
and
was
about
to
leave
when
graves
ejaculated
sit
down
bill
bill
sat
down
took
his
hat
from
his
bald
head
and
placed
his
fingers
complacently
around
a
smooth
white
wart
on
his
cranium
and
waited
he
looked
questioningly
at
the
rich
man
and
the
druggist
with
the
hands
the
church
subject
had
been
thrashed
out
long
ago
the
women
of
the
congregation
gaining
the
day
in
spite
of
the
august
presence
of
some
of
the
deacons
who
openly
declared
that
the
female
portion
of
the
church
was
unbecomingly
usurping
the
authority
of
the
men
because
of
this
flagrant
disobedience
of
the
church
creed
bill
hopkins
had
taken
his
name
from
the
roll
and
was
known
to
have
said
that
he
would
not
be
led
by
a
shepherd
who
could
not
order
his
flock
he
smacked
his
lips
for
the
coming
argument
while
the
minister
glad
to
have
him
among
them
again
felt
his
hopes
rise
higher
bates
flattened
his
hands
with
delight
noticing
a
smile
that
drew
down
the
corners
of
jones
lips
long
ago
the
pleasant
religious
argument
of
ithaca
amen
corner
had
become
a
thing
of
the
past
because
of
the
absence
of
bill
hopkins
he
had
been
the
zest
of
the
crowd
the
dominie
forgetting
his
grievance
of
the
supper
table
straightened
himself
for
the
combat
he
had
suddenly
conceived
a
plan
whereby
he
could
gain
a
friend
to
aid
him
in
the
coming
squatter
fight
bill
hopkins
still
waited
with
a
quizzical
expression
in
his
eyes
strange
happenings
in
town
for
a
few
days
past
said
graves
the
skinner
case
asked
bill
rubbing
gently
the
smooth
white
wart
yes
assented
the
minister
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
bill
the
girl
a
brick
commented
hopkins
and
sank
into
silence
the
girl
not
being
tried
for
murder
rebuked
the
minister
sharply
but
she
played
her
part
with
feelin
and
power
was
the
drawling
reply
the
clergyman
saw
a
flitting
expression
of
triumph
in
the
face
she
make
a
capital
actress
ruminated
graves
he
glanced
at
the
rich
man
to
see
if
he
coincided
with
him
but
that
gentleman
was
looking
into
the
street
we
all
act
in
this
world
excused
bill
even
you
ministers
use
methods
that
you
have
found
in
elocution
to
bring
your
beliefs
to
bear
upon
your
congregations
graves
did
not
relish
being
classed
with
the
squatter
child
but
he
made
no
comment
upon
it
he
changed
his
tactics
bill
said
he
have
you
altered
your
ideas
about
the
church
what
ideas
well
about
women
having
the
privilege
of
speaking
in
meetings
bill
shook
his
head
and
graves
resumed
well
i
changing
my
mind
i
going
to
stop
this
nonsense
the
rich
man
sat
up
and
the
druggist
scenting
a
religious
rumpus
drew
his
stool
nearer
bill
coughed
loudly
those
women
continued
graves
have
had
their
own
way
too
long
i
shall
put
a
stop
to
it
immediately
bill
hopkins
wondered
what
was
coming
it
behooved
him
to
wait
and
see
so
he
settled
back
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
piercing
eyes
directed
steadily
upon
the
pastor
a
dark
flush
mounted
to
the
minister
face
he
had
expected
that
such
condescension
to
an
would
be
received
with
enthusiasm
as
no
other
of
the
ameners
offered
a
word
graves
continued
next
thing
that
we
know
the
women
will
be
coming
into
the
church
with
uncovered
heads
i
wonder
i
stood
it
so
long
still
bill
did
not
speak
he
could
remember
that
when
the
dispute
had
been
at
its
height
these
had
not
been
the
sentiments
of
pastor
graves
in
fact
when
a
delegation
had
gone
to
the
parsonage
to
demand
obedience
to
the
constitution
of
the
church
the
dominie
had
replied
that
the
ladies
had
come
out
victorious
in
the
matter
and
that
it
was
an
idea
to
forbid
the
women
to
speak
or
pray
in
public
if
they
so
wished
and
the
delegates
had
gone
away
from
the
rectory
and
bill
hopkins
with
several
others
from
the
church
seeing
that
not
one
of
the
respectable
ameners
was
going
to
help
him
the
dominie
sputtered
out
his
wrath
in
another
direction
if
young
had
kept
his
hands
off
that
skinner
business
there
have
been
the
slightest
chance
of
the
fisherman
winning
out
ah
here
where
the
shoe
pinches
thought
hopkins
the
parson
needs
help
to
wrest
skinner
squatter
rights
from
him
but
he
did
not
voice
his
thoughts
i
guess
that
right
dominie
were
his
spoken
words
skinner
have
many
friends
in
the
court
until
that
girl
came
in
she
certainly
did
make
a
change
in
the
ideas
of
most
people
in
this
town
fools
to
let
a
child
like
that
break
up
the
dignity
of
a
graves
settled
back
angrily
in
his
chair
he
had
lost
in
the
game
he
was
about
to
play
with
bill
hopkins
lost
before
the
game
had
begun
skinner
can
thank
his
kid
for
his
life
nevertheless
interjected
jones
for
another
jury
will
never
convict
him
think
not
queried
the
druggist
bates
question
remained
unanswered
for
dominie
graves
turned
the
subject
again
bill
if
i
come
out
strong
in
the
church
and
give
you
your
own
way
in
the
disputed
question
then
you
must
do
something
for
me
i
speak
to
you
later
about
it
pretty
far
along
in
the
day
was
bill
answer
but
as
you
please
dominie
i
do
know
what
you
want
but
most
of
your
friends
will
stick
by
you
if
the
church
is
run
on
its
old
plan
and
according
to
the
creed
and
the
bible
when
minister
graves
walked
home
he
felt
that
in
spite
of
family
differences
he
had
scored
a
point
in
getting
from
hopkins
a
tacit
consent
to
come
back
into
his
congregation
chapter
xvi
when
the
family
gathered
about
the
table
the
next
morning
in
the
rectory
the
dominie
told
his
wife
solemnly
that
he
wished
to
talk
with
her
after
the
children
had
gone
to
school
breakfast
over
he
broached
the
subject
of
the
women
talking
in
prayer
meeting
graves
listening
eagerly
as
the
pastor
wife
she
had
done
the
best
in
her
power
but
her
power
had
been
weak
and
the
stronger
ones
in
the
congregation
had
ridden
over
her
convictions
and
teachings
there
was
augusta
hall
the
beautiful
wife
of
one
of
the
deacons
who
had
demanded
that
she
be
allowed
to
voice
her
sentiments
in
public
and
other
women
had
followed
her
lead
although
it
had
been
absolutely
against
the
tenets
of
the
church
this
woman
was
in
graves
mind
when
the
dominie
brought
down
his
hand
upon
the
table
saying
he
had
decided
to
stop
once
and
for
all
the
nonsense
in
his
church
which
was
keeping
the
best
of
his
members
away
graves
breathed
hall
name
meekly
to
her
husband
she
can
leave
the
church
growled
graves
in
my
mind
it
almost
sacrilegious
for
women
to
dare
to
go
so
far
that
some
of
the
best
of
its
members
will
leave
a
church
maria
you
must
talk
to
hall
and
bring
her
to
reason
if
you
ca
succeed
replied
graves
how
do
you
expect
me
to
you
her
pastor
i
will
go
and
talk
to
her
first
then
you
follow
close
upon
my
heels
maria
and
between
us
both
we
will
get
bill
hopkins
and
carey
back
among
us
if
they
come
the
rest
will
late
in
the
afternoon
graves
put
on
her
bonnet
and
with
a
sigh
tied
the
strings
under
her
withered
chin
in
the
very
moment
when
the
congregation
had
at
last
become
reconciled
to
the
privileges
extended
to
its
female
members
another
church
war
was
to
be
fought
but
the
little
woman
dared
not
refuse
her
husband
command
so
she
climbed
the
long
hill
toward
the
south
and
timidly
rang
the
bell
marked
hall
her
husband
would
have
been
there
and
gone
for
the
afternoon
was
well
toward
its
close
as
the
servant
ushered
her
in
graves
heard
loud
voices
coming
from
the
and
instantly
recognized
one
of
them
as
the
clergyman
it
all
very
well
hall
he
was
saying
for
the
women
to
work
if
they
can
do
it
without
showing
too
much
authority
but
my
dear
lady
i
have
been
studying
into
this
matter
and
it
is
positively
against
the
scriptural
injunction
for
women
to
speak
in
church
where
did
you
read
that
asked
hall
handing
the
dominie
a
bible
which
he
did
not
take
in
his
fingers
i
know
and
you
know
where
it
is
without
looking
said
he
sharply
there
is
a
command
from
paul
that
all
women
should
keep
silent
in
the
church
in
the
presence
of
men
paul
was
an
old
bachelor
irreverently
answered
hall
what
did
he
know
about
women
and
their
needs
he
received
the
commandments
from
god
replied
the
pastor
gravely
not
that
one
and
what
more
i
am
going
to
talk
all
i
want
to
and
if
there
is
a
man
who
does
not
want
to
hear
let
him
go
away
until
he
either
changes
his
mind
or
desires
to
take
things
as
they
are
why
the
women
have
been
speaking
in
our
church
for
over
a
year
at
this
juncture
graves
walked
in
pale
and
weary
she
dropped
weakly
into
a
chair
your
husband
has
just
informed
me
snapped
hall
her
beautiful
face
flushing
as
she
spoke
that
we
are
not
to
speak
any
more
at
the
church
meetings
do
you
approve
of
that
graves
i
sure
like
all
dutiful
and
obedient
wives
came
the
sharp
interruption
from
the
minister
without
giving
his
spouse
a
chance
to
speak
my
wife
thinks
as
i
do
hall
allow
me
to
entreat
you
to
follow
the
dictates
of
your
conscience
and
obey
your
husband
always
my
husband
gives
me
my
own
way
answered
hall
with
a
toss
of
her
head
there
he
is
wrong
but
i
shall
leave
you
to
talk
things
over
with
my
wife
on
sunday
i
shall
make
it
the
theme
of
my
sermon
and
i
hope
before
wednesday
my
dear
hall
that
you
and
some
others
will
look
upon
the
matter
in
a
different
light
the
dominie
wended
his
way
toward
the
business
quarter
of
the
city
and
turned
into
the
gas
company
office
inquiring
for
hall
he
was
ushered
into
a
private
room
marked
president
and
heartily
greeted
one
of
the
deacons
of
his
church
anything
wrong
asked
hall
noticing
the
expression
upon
his
face
no
only
i
called
about
a
new
rule
which
we
going
to
pass
wednesday
evening
and
you
can
help
us
if
you
will
the
president
looked
up
inquiringly
the
women
must
no
longer
speak
at
the
prayer
meeting
hall
half
rose
from
his
chair
as
these
words
fell
from
the
clergyman
lips
but
he
sank
mutely
back
it
has
become
necessary
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
church
explained
graves
and
i
have
taken
up
this
matter
with
some
of
the
members
also
with
your
wife
hall
dropped
his
eyes
upon
his
left
hand
with
the
fingers
of
which
he
was
bending
back
those
of
his
right
and
what
did
she
say
i
think
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
talk
with
her
hall
surely
you
have
enough
influence
over
her
to
make
her
see
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
women
should
cease
their
i
thought
dominie
broke
in
the
deacon
that
we
had
long
outgrown
such
notions
you
had
better
let
matters
go
on
as
they
are
the
minister
shook
his
head
emphatically
and
looked
searchingly
at
his
parishioner
fact
is
hall
you
know
that
it
is
not
a
personal
thing
with
me
but
for
the
good
of
the
church
hopkins
has
left
and
carey
only
comes
when
he
feels
like
it
several
others
stay
away
without
a
place
to
worship
simply
because
the
ladies
will
have
their
way
i
have
no
trouble
with
my
wife
and
no
man
would
if
he
were
to
demand
obedience
as
god
says
that
he
should
i
shall
preach
upon
it
sunday
do
make
it
too
strong
ventured
hall
thinking
of
his
beautiful
wife
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
it
made
no
difference
whether
women
were
silent
or
not
whether
they
wore
hats
to
church
or
came
in
with
bare
heads
he
was
happy
in
his
home
life
and
was
not
willing
to
bring
about
discord
by
arguments
that
meant
nothing
to
him
when
the
church
matter
had
come
up
before
he
had
acquiesced
without
a
word
had
watched
the
fight
as
it
progressed
and
when
it
ended
had
settled
back
to
enjoy
peace
a
happy
official
of
ithaca
gas
company
he
looked
out
under
his
brows
at
the
clergyman
as
he
fingered
the
on
his
desk
he
took
it
up
mechanically
and
read
the
inscription
on
the
handle
from
me
to
you
his
wife
had
given
it
to
him
and
hall
mentally
wondered
if
the
woman
who
could
think
of
and
would
dare
to
use
such
a
unique
expression
would
be
frightened
by
a
word
from
him
without
asking
augusta
the
husband
knew
that
his
wife
would
be
the
first
woman
to
rise
to
speak
next
wednesday
evening
this
much
he
intimated
to
graves
an
expression
of
sarcasm
flitted
over
the
clergyman
countenance
but
it
quickly
vanished
graves
was
trying
to
add
to
his
strong
friends
that
day
he
only
remarked
that
he
hoped
it
would
be
settled
amicably
the
president
ventured
another
shot
dominie
there
a
complete
turn
in
the
affairs
of
skinner
he
says
that
he
did
not
commit
the
murder
that
he
positively
did
not
pick
up
the
gun
from
the
shore
simply
because
he
owned
the
gun
is
no
proof
that
he
used
it
young
says
young
had
better
attend
to
his
campus
business
interrupted
graves
he
will
have
all
he
can
do
there
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
skinner
is
guilty
i
should
have
thought
that
his
conviction
was
proof
of
that
but
he
did
have
a
chance
to
prove
his
innocence
replied
hall
he
has
such
a
good
reputation
among
his
own
people
that
young
is
going
to
take
up
subscriptions
for
another
trial
elias
turned
sharply
upon
the
gas
official
few
people
who
understand
the
matter
will
give
money
to
save
the
life
of
a
squatter
that
another
thing
i
going
to
preach
upon
next
sunday
the
very
manner
in
which
they
live
would
prove
what
bad
citizens
they
are
we
ca
hang
a
man
argued
hall
because
he
does
live
in
accordance
with
our
stilted
notions
professor
young
says
that
the
girl
is
a
genius
that
she
has
a
beautiful
voice
i
promised
that
if
he
took
up
a
contribution
for
the
family
that
i
would
send
him
a
check
elias
graves
rose
hastily
to
his
feet
forgetting
to
put
out
his
hand
as
he
went
out
he
now
hated
tessibel
skinner
with
a
deep
religious
hatred
and
it
would
be
war
between
him
and
her
for
the
life
of
the
imprisoned
squatter
president
hall
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
closed
the
door
of
his
private
office
after
his
pastor
had
departed
it
evident
why
graves
wants
the
women
turned
down
mused
he
he
thinks
that
he
will
draw
about
him
again
such
men
as
hopkins
and
carey
and
that
they
will
help
him
in
removing
skinner
from
his
land
i
help
persecute
the
poor
devil
gad
but
that
daughter
of
his
did
turn
things
upside
down
i
wonder
what
augusta
will
say
to
me
when
i
go
home
it
was
a
keen
cold
and
blizzardly
sunday
morning
when
the
bells
of
the
different
churches
rang
out
upon
the
air
ithaca
was
astir
and
her
citizens
anxious
to
worship
for
hour
the
streets
teemed
with
people
then
became
as
silent
as
if
the
town
were
uninhabited
minister
graves
took
his
place
in
the
pulpit
and
scanned
the
pews
which
were
filled
to
overflowing
not
only
had
his
members
come
one
and
all
but
people
from
other
congregations
were
standing
at
the
back
of
the
railing
eager
to
hear
the
mighty
effort
which
would
be
given
forth
from
the
clergyman
eloquent
tongue
elias
graves
took
his
text
from
genesis
and
thy
desire
shall
be
to
thy
husband
and
he
shall
rule
over
thee
the
minister
leaned
far
over
his
flock
as
he
finished
this
impressive
text
his
eyes
fell
upon
deacon
hall
pew
then
upon
his
own
in
which
sat
his
wife
with
babe
near
her
frederick
was
between
teola
and
the
little
girl
and
they
were
all
earnestly
watching
their
father
something
was
going
to
happen
but
they
did
not
know
what
the
deep
voice
broke
out
into
a
prayer
followed
by
a
soulful
anthem
from
the
choir
minister
graves
rose
with
dignity
and
began
his
sermon
it
is
my
intention
said
he
to
divide
my
sermon
this
morning
directly
in
two
because
my
subjects
are
so
entirely
different
before
the
expiration
of
it
you
will
see
the
force
of
my
argument
and
will
i
hope
profit
by
it
he
continued
by
saying
a
house
divided
against
itself
would
surely
fall
that
even
a
stone
structure
built
upon
sand
would
slip
into
the
sea
brethren
the
sea
of
which
i
speak
is
a
sea
of
discontent
and
disobedience
from
my
reading
text
you
will
see
that
god
commanded
that
woman
should
be
obedient
that
she
should
obey
her
husband
to
the
letter
to
the
letter
brethren
there
was
a
decided
rustle
of
silken
petticoats
in
the
church
it
was
the
disobedience
of
our
first
mother
spoke
the
clergyman
that
threw
adam
into
with
his
creator
and
also
adam
love
for
her
that
drove
him
from
the
garden
of
eden
brethren
god
is
good
to
mankind
ever
ready
to
listen
to
his
appeals
if
adam
had
only
believed
in
the
greatness
as
well
as
the
goodness
of
god
he
would
have
spurned
the
woman
who
had
dared
to
so
flagrantly
disobey
instead
of
following
her
from
the
garden
adam
had
more
than
one
rib
went
on
the
minister
and
how
readily
and
kindly
would
god
have
disposed
of
the
first
sinning
eve
and
under
the
pleasant
sleep
of
the
man
adam
extracted
another
rib
out
of
which
he
would
have
constructed
another
and
yet
more
beautiful
woman
some
of
us
are
finding
it
impossible
to
keep
order
in
our
families
and
until
we
do
we
can
not
expect
to
live
to
the
glory
of
god
a
loud
hacking
cough
came
from
deacon
hall
pew
and
many
heads
were
turned
toward
it
this
disconcerted
the
clergyman
for
a
moment
but
he
picked
up
the
threads
of
his
sermon
and
resumed
if
every
man
in
this
little
city
would
rely
upon
the
goodness
of
god
to
supply
him
with
another
eve
when
the
woman
joined
to
him
in
holy
matrimony
disobeys
his
law
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
order
in
his
household
just
as
happiness
was
given
to
lot
after
the
turning
to
salt
of
his
wife
the
minister
paused
the
silence
was
so
deathly
that
it
appalled
him
he
allowed
his
eyes
to
fall
upon
the
memorial
window
with
a
man
face
upon
it
the
words
underneath
the
figure
passed
before
him
dimly
then
he
remembered
that
he
was
preaching
a
sermon
was
he
not
the
chosen
shepherd
of
the
flock
was
he
not
the
one
man
called
by
god
to
show
these
people
the
righteous
paths
in
which
to
walk
should
his
voice
be
silenced
because
others
did
not
believe
as
he
did
and
was
he
not
showing
them
the
light
through
the
scriptures
with
these
thoughts
in
his
mind
and
renewed
energy
in
his
voice
he
spoke
again
i
should
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
raise
a
false
alarm
neither
do
i
desire
to
enter
homes
and
bring
discord
there
but
i
read
from
a
passage
under
my
hand
thy
right
hand
offend
thee
cut
it
off
from
the
words
of
the
scriptures
i
have
proven
to
you
that
a
household
must
be
ruled
by
the
husband
and
by
him
alone
and
that
it
is
the
duty
of
every
wife
to
obey
her
husband
as
long
as
she
shall
live
i
shall
ask
the
women
of
this
congregation
not
to
rise
next
wednesday
evening
in
the
prayer
meeting
either
to
pray
or
testify
the
privilege
has
been
withdrawn
as
one
perniciously
against
the
tenets
of
the
church
for
paul
says
in
first
timothy
suffer
not
a
woman
to
teach
nor
to
usurp
authority
over
the
man
but
to
be
in
silence
also
i
give
you
paul
further
command
the
deacons
be
the
husband
of
one
wife
ruling
their
children
and
their
own
houses
well
he
ran
over
the
last
few
words
quickly
for
the
louder
rustle
of
silk
could
be
heard
the
minister
changed
his
subject
and
gave
them
another
text
which
said
that
the
wicked
people
of
the
earth
should
be
cut
down
was
the
minister
going
to
sanction
the
killing
of
wives
who
refused
to
obey
their
husbands
had
he
lost
his
mind
but
his
voice
rang
out
upon
the
congregation
upon
a
subject
in
which
they
had
recently
become
so
interested
there
is
on
our
city
said
the
clergyman
a
terrible
blot
the
wicked
ones
of
jerusalem
could
not
equal
them
in
wickedness
the
plans
of
god
in
keeping
peace
among
his
people
are
to
be
carried
out
with
as
much
vigor
as
they
were
three
thousand
years
ago
i
need
not
give
you
the
details
of
a
murder
committed
a
short
time
ago
within
the
limits
of
our
city
the
very
fact
that
the
murderer
has
the
chance
of
another
trial
after
his
conviction
demonstrates
that
something
must
be
done
and
quickly
if
the
secular
law
is
not
able
to
wipe
out
such
a
blot
then
the
church
must
help
it
is
my
idea
brethren
that
the
weeds
of
the
earth
must
be
cut
down
and
by
weeds
i
mean
bad
men
if
a
petition
is
handed
you
to
sign
asking
time
for
orn
skinner
i
ask
you
one
and
all
not
to
place
your
names
upon
it
the
clergyman
suddenly
stopped
closing
his
bible
papa
would
cut
off
tessibel
father
head
if
he
could
would
he
frederick
whispered
babe
frederick
gave
the
child
a
reproving
glance
and
the
little
girl
sank
back
after
explaining
that
if
skinner
were
hung
papa
would
have
the
land
which
ought
to
be
his
but
as
his
father
was
speaking
again
the
student
turned
his
serious
face
toward
the
pulpit
brethren
finished
the
pastor
impressively
before
i
close
i
would
adjure
every
one
of
you
to
take
the
reins
of
his
household
into
his
own
hands
and
then
looking
straight
at
deacon
hall
he
concluded
and
if
you
have
never
had
the
reins
then
i
command
you
to
take
them
this
day
and
rule
your
homes
as
god
would
have
you
us
pray
augusta
hall
made
but
one
remark
on
her
way
home
from
church
wednesday
evening
i
am
going
to
show
dominie
graves
that
he
ca
rule
every
woman
in

i
want
you
to
go

chapter
xvii
orn
skinner
was
to
be
taken
to
prison
the
monday
after
the
famous
sermon
preached
by
dominie
graves
professor
young
had
gained
permission
for
tessibel
to
spend
fifteen
minutes
with
skinner
before
his
departure
there
was
something
about
the
fishermaid
that
touched
his
heart
her
ignorance
her
devotion
to
her
father
and
the
loveliness
of
the
anxious
young
face
haunted
the
professor
during
his
working
hours
and
at
night
when
he
could
not
sleep
he
created
plans
for
her
future
and
her
father
release
he
persuaded
himself
continually
that
tessibel
was
not
the
motive
for
clearing
the
fisherman
of
the
murder
charge
it
was
the
love
of
justice
justice
to
the
squatter
and
his
lovely
child
often
the
lawyer
had
set
his
jaw
when
he
thought
of
minister
graves
and
the
evident
malice
shown
by
the
parson
against
the
fisherman
that
monday
afternoon
he
met
tessibel
as
she
came
into
the
much
the
same
tessibel
he
had
seen
in
the
professor
young
took
the
girl
hand
in
his
and
led
her
into
the
small
waiting
room
of
the
stone
prison
he
desired
to
be
alone
with
her
for
a
few
minutes
that
he
might
satisfy
himself
as
to
her
history
which
since
her
dramatic
entrance
into
the
had
been
so
distorted
you
have
no
mother
i
understand
my
dear
he
began
nope
and
tessibel
shifted
one
boot
along
the
seam
in
the
red
carpet
do
you
remember
her
nope
do
remember
none
but
daddy
have
you
ever
been
to
school
tessibel
shook
her
head
displaying
her
teeth
in
smile
which
quickly
faded
squatter
brats
do
never
go
to
school
she
muttered
she
edged
away
from
the
professor
raising
her
eyes
pleadingly
to
his
the
man
read
the
desire
the
girl
dared
not
put
into
words
but
without
heeding
her
glance
he
proceeded
to
question
her
would
you
like
to
go
to
school
nope
all
i
want
air
daddy
home
in
the
shanty
that
air
enough
for
me
she
suddenly
turned
her
face
away
toward
the
door
that
led
to
the
upper
cells
but
if
i
assure
you
urged
professor
young
that
your
father
will
positively
get
another
trial
which
is
all
that
can
be
done
at
present
would
you
then
like
to
study
a
definite
shake
of
her
head
and
another
quick
glance
was
answer
i
wants
to
read
the
bible
she
said
presently
turning
toward
the
professor
it
air
a
dum
hard
book
to
read
i
hear
professor
young
tugged
at
the
corners
of
his
mustache
to
keep
down
a
smile
it
would
be
easy
for
you
to
read
any
book
if
you
went
to
school
he
told
her
how
old
are
you
comin
sixteen
and
can
not
read
it
a
pity
and
would
you
like
to
learn
to
sing
young
was
desirous
of
touching
a
responsive
strain
in
the
girl
dum
sight
rather
see
daddy
that
what
i
came
here
for
ai
ye
going
to
let
me
see
him
professor
young
rose
with
a
sigh
like
the
rest
of
her
race
she
did
not
know
gratitude
he
had
worked
diligently
preparing
an
appeal
for
a
new
trial
which
would
bring
acquittal
to
her
humpbacked
father
and
he
was
interested
in
her
own
welfare
but
her
thankless
words
checked
his
inquiry
the
professor
did
not
realize
what
love
meant
to
tessibel
for
every
desire
within
her
paled
into
insignificance
beside
her
passionate
devotion
to
daddy
skinner
tess
followed
him
silently
up
the
long
winding
stairs
her
heart
thumping
in
anticipation
the
deputy
search
of
her
clothing
brought
a
flush
to
her
face
but
without
a
word
she
allowed
him
to
draw
off
the
great
boots
and
quietly
watched
him
as
he
turned
them
upside
down
receiving
them
back
gravely
her
longing
to
see
daddy
skinner
to
be
in
his
arms
to
hug
the
grizzled
head
overshadowed
even
this
indignity
so
long
had
it
been
since
tess
had
nestled
in
the
shaggy
chin
hair
that
her
heart
was
sore
and
wildly
impatient
faith
in
frederick
god
had
been
forgotten
no
other
thought
occupied
her
mind
save
that
they
were
going
to
take
away
her
beloved
the
only
one
left
to
her
she
deigned
not
a
glance
at
professor
young
after
the
deputy
had
gone
and
measured
the
floor
restlessly
with
the
stamp
stamp
stamp
of
the
big
boots
professor
young
presence
was
no
more
to
her
than
the
small
insects
which
scurried
from
the
edge
of
the
floor
covering
into
the
light
and
then
back
into
their
hiding
places
afraid
of
the
human
giants
which
loomed
up
before
them
what
did
she
care
for
reading
writing
and
such
things
she
wanted
to
be
with
daddy
skinner
wanted
him
home
in
the
shanty
as
of
old
she
kept
her
eyes
riveted
upon
the
open
door
suddenly
she
leaned
forward
for
the
ominous
clanging
of
irons
came
to
her
ears
she
thought
of
the
night
she
had
been
found
scaling
the
ivy
to
daddy
cell
how
long
she
had
waited
in
the
darkness
for
only
a
little
word
about
him
they
had
given
her
none
and
her
vivid
imagination
brought
back
the
anguish
of
that
lonely
walk
through
the
storm
to
the
hut
approaching
footsteps
made
her
alert
and
in
the
paling
of
the
sweet
face
professor
young
divined
the
tumult
going
on
in
the
tender
uneducated
heart
child
exclaimed
he
do
make
your
father
going
away
harder
for
him
shut
up
muttered
tess
just
as
the
huge
shackled
prisoner
appeared
at
the
door
every
muscle
in
the
strong
young
body
stiffened
tess
had
not
seen
her
father
since
the
trial
intensity
narrowed
the
eyes
the
drooping
white
lids
covering
the
lights
in
the
brown
iris
the
small
hands
clutched
convulsively
daddy
skinner
her
daddy
was
standing
before
her
his
eyes
piercing
her
very
soul
from
under
the
long
shaggy
brows
she
bounded
toward
him
and
two
creatures
of
primeval
passion
met
in
one
long
embrace
it
was
the
passion
of
an
aboriginal
father
for
his
child
of
a
primitive
girl
watching
her
loved
one
separate
from
her
through
the
portals
of
death
tess
had
lifted
herself
deftly
to
the
and
lowered
her
head
to
the
grizzled
face
the
man
large
mouth
covering
the
twitching
lips
of
the
girl
the
shrouding
red
hair
hid
the
squatter
faces
from
the
professor
and
he
turned
his
eyes
away
he
could
not
look
upon
them
without
distressing
emotion
the
strange
maid
was
an
enigma
to
him
and
he
found
himself
wishing
that
he
might
guide
her
future
when
young
glanced
again
the
fisherman
had
seated
himself
and
had
slipped
tessibel
from
his
shoulders
gathering
her
closely
into
his
great
embrace
for
she
was
the
brawn
of
his
brawn
and
the
bone
of
his
bone
under
the
squatter
huge
red
arm
the
had
wedged
her
head
tightly
the
low
brows
were
taut
with
pain
the
bronze
eyes
defiantly
closed
tess
was
as
firmly
fixed
in
her
position
as
the
iron
chains
that
encased
her
daddy
ankles
she
had
come
to
stay
with
daddy
skinner
to
go
with
him
where
he
went
in
spite
of
the
great
man
from
the
hill
in
spite
of
the
majesty
of
the
law
even
in
spite
of
daddy
himself
the
deputy
warden
with
open
watch
stood
over
the
prisoner
with
observing
eye
the
fifteen
minutes
allowed
the
girl
were
gone
and
he
slowly
touched
the
humpback
on
the
shoulder
time
up
skinner
said
he
sorry
but
it
the
law
you
know
skinner
tried
to
draw
the
curly
head
from
under
his
arm
but
the
muscles
in
the
girl
body
only
tightened
the
white
lips
grew
more
rigid
it
air
time
fer
me
to
go
tess
murmured
the
squatter
in
her
ear
i
air
i
i
air
a
goin
with
ye
the
words
were
scarcely
more
than
the
flutter
of
a
breath
the
deputy
warden
stepped
forward
a
little
then
back
to
his
place
by
the
door
the
professor
rose
but
sank
again
to
his
chair
the
of
the
fisherman
pulsated
as
if
a
separate
heart
was
beating
in
each
great
hump
tess
was
as
immovable
as
if
nature
had
aided
her
to
grow
into
her
position
skinner
again
tried
to
loosen
the
bare
red
arms
ye
ca
go
to
prison
with
me
tess
he
said
coaxingly
set
up
like
a
good

daddy
skinner
not
one
whit
less
rigid
was
the
slender
body
the
closed
lids
only
pressed
tighter
together
the
deputy
grunted
impatiently
come
kid
said
he
gruffly
it
the
law

tamperin
with
do
you
hear
let
the
prisoner
go
professor
young
felt
his
throat
tighten
the
pitiful
sight
of
the
girl
the
ragged
skirt
the
terrible
unkemptness
of
the
small
body
almost
brought
a
shout
from
his
lips
it
was
a
new
sensation
to
the
learned
man
a
stinging
rebellious
pitying
sensation
a
feeling
that
he
wanted
to
shake
the
girl
from
her
father
arms
and
then
care
tenderly
for
her
one
great
boot
had
fallen
from
tessibel
many
times
frozen
foot
the
little
toe
marked
and
cut
by
frost
limply
hanging
independent
of
its
fellows
made
young
wince
suddenly
tessibel
sat
up
and
wound
her
arms
more
tightly
about
the
big
humpbacked
body
i
ca
go
back
to
the
shanty
without
ye
daddy
she
whimpered
and
they
said
as
how

and
i
goin

young
turned
his
head
again
toward
the
window
he
could
not
banish
the
wish
that
tess
would
listen
to
him
the
deputy
placed
his
hand
firmly
upon
the
prisoner
arm
the
fisherman
himself
trying
in
vain
to
loosen
the
girl
fingers
from
the
shaggy
beard
i
i
air
to
go
with
daddy
i
air
i
air
tessibel
brought
out
the
words
snappingly
but
skinner
with
the
aid
of
the
deputy
opened
the
clenched
hands
tessibel
gave
way
she
was
unable
to
stop
the
awful
impending
danger
that
hung
over
her
absolute
separation
from
daddy
skinner
daddy
daddy
she
gasped
sitting
up
straight
man
man
let
me

the
official
moved
anxiously
as
she
made
this
appeal
to
him
she
was
now
standing
on
her
bare
feet
but
she
bounded
forward
as
the
rose
and
fell
and
large
tears
dragged
themselves
from
the
lowered
lids
of
the
fisherman
eyes
she
pantingly
caught
her
hand
in
hers
kisses
daddy
skinner
kisses
on
the
bill
for
tess
before
ye
go
tess
air
a
bad
brat
she
could
not
finish
the
sentence
for
the
squatter
had
pressed
her
to
him
convulsively
then
skinner
dropped
the
slender
relaxed
body
into
the
wooden
and
took
up
his
march
behind
the
deputy
the
professor
mutely
watched
the
storm
desperate
and
terrible
break
over
the
squatter
girl
her
wild
weeping
settled
into
sobs
the
sound
of
which
rent
and
shook
the
man
emotions
at
last
he
ventured
to
speak
child
may
i
be
your
friend
no
friends
i
want
it
air
somethin
to
love
to
kiss
it
air
daddy
i
want
the
voice
came
brokenly
from
the
veil
of
red
hair
just
then
the
great
iron
door
clanged
in
the
distance
behind
the
prisoner
tessibel
sprang
to
the
open
door
straining
her
ears
to
catch
another
sound
from
the
black
place
which
had
enveloped
her
father
within
its
menacing
shadows
he
air
gone
daddy
air
gone
the
words
were
spoken
slowly
and
hurt
the
watching
man
almost
as
if
the
torture
were
his
own
a
shriek
rose
from
the
rounded
white
throat
and
the
girl
threw
herself
bootless
upon
the
floor
and
screamed
in
passionate
childish
sorrow
the
wealth
of
disheveled
hair
mantling
the
dirty
jacket
and
covering
the
woful
face
neither
the
professor
nor
tessibel
heard
the
hurrying
footsteps
upon
the
stone
floor
in
the
prison
corridor
but
tess
still
in
the
frenzy
of
her
new
grief
heard
her
name
spoken
through
a
maze
tessibel
skinner
and
then
again
tessibel
skinner
the
squatter
raised
a
pale
face
to
frederick
graves
she
sat
up
with
a
painful
flush
drawing
the
bare
legs
closely
under
the
wet
skirt
the
student
spoke
again
tessibel
skinner
has
forgotten
that
god
rules
and
is
just
have
your
prayers
proven
nothing
to
you
tessibel
gazed
scarlet
and
embarrassed
into
frederick
face
her
under
lip
quivering
the
red
head
sank
slowly
down
and
the
exhausted
child
wept
as
only
a
hurt
child
can
weep
i
were
with
him
she
cried
between
her
sobs
i
could
have
washed
dishes
in
the
prison
to
be
near
daddy
i
air
such
a
lonely
tess
him
in
the
hut
the
student
lifted
her
gently
in
his
arms
and
seated
her
in
the
wooden
chair
with
the
tenderness
of
a
brother
he
placed
the
great
boots
once
more
upon
the
girl
feet
and
tessibel
was
ready
to
start
again
upon
her
long
tramp
through
the
row
of
huts
to
her
shanty
home
the
tears
had
ceased
to
flow
and
with
bowed
head
she
was
hanging
upon
every
word
the
student
uttered
professor
young
went
quietly
out
unheeded
by
either
girl
or
boy
no
one
blames
you
for
your
grief
child
at
being
obliged
to
leave
your
father
frederick
said
huskily
but
are
you
going
to
take
off
the
of
god
and
forget
all
that
he
has
promised
you
tessibel
blinked
ignorantly
at
the
long
words
armor
of
god
armor
of
god
it
was
something
she
had
not
heard
before
perhaps
it
meant
that
the
student
christ
would
not
help
her
now
it
all
came
back
in
a
flood
of
light
her
utter
faithlessness
in
the
prayers
of
the
student
in
the
god
who
had
waved
her
so
many
assurances
she
had
not
dared
to
look
into
the
noble
face
above
her
but
when
they
stepped
from
the
jail
into
the
street
she
raised
her
eyes
to
frederick
and
murmured
i
air
sorry
cause
i
were
so
cussed
i
only
wanted
to
go
with
daddy
i
realize
that
replied
frederick
making
preparations
to
walk
with
her
by
drawing
his
coat
collar
tightly
about
his
neck
but
it
was
impossible
and
from
now
until
the
time
he
comes
back
study
your
bible
tess
halted
a
moment
looking
up
steadily
into
the
dark
eyes
of
the
tall
boy
does
the
bible
talk
of
daddy
skinner
she
entreated
does
it
tell
as
how
he
air
comin
home
indeed
yes
was
the
student
answer
there
nothing
the
bible
does
contain
the
saviour
was
nailed
to
the
cross
bearing
his
misery
to
give
you
a
heavenly
harp
and
crown
tessibel
if
you
read
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
you
will
see
it
all
plainly
you
can
be
happy
if
you
pray
and
are
a
good
girl
while
your
father
is
away
then
desiring
to
ease
the
face
he
added
it
will
please
him
if
you
write
him
often
and
tell
him
about
yourself
come
now
it
getting
too
dark
for
you
to
walk
those
tracks
child
have
you
a
friend
in
town
with
whom
you
can
pass
the
night
frightful
to
tramp
that
distance
alone
tess
stiffened
instantly
daddy
shanty
was
in
her
care
and
of
what
night
had
she
ever
been
afraid
i
air
a
goin
home
she
answered
almost
sullenly
ai
a
dum
bit
afraid
of
nothin
as
frederick
turned
to
her
side
tess
glanced
up
confusedly
ye
ca
walk
with
me
through
the
streets
of
ithacy
said
she
why
not
cause
well
cause
ye
ca
that
why
frederick
understood
and
gravely
lifting
his
hat
turned
in
the
other
direction
with
the
remark
that
he
would
see
her
again
soon
the
girl
stood
for
some
seconds
staring
fixedly
after
him
then
wiping
her
face
with
the
sleeve
of
a
ragged
jacket
she
started
off
toward
the
squatters
row
chapter
xviii
many
were
the
troubling
thoughts
which
possessed
the
mind
of
tess
as
she
strode
along
in
the
fulvid
depths
of
her
eyes
there
dwelt
an
expression
of
misery
as
the
child
took
her
way
through
the
streets
with
none
to
care
whither
she
went
her
face
lighted
with
a
sudden
determination
frederick
had
told
her
to
read
to
study
to
pray
that
these
three
with
faith
would
save
daddy
skinner
from
the
rope
of
the
canadian
indian
but
the
student
like
all
those
having
plenty
forgot
to
enquire
how
tess
was
to
read
without
books
or
study
without
anyone
to
teach
her
true
tess
could
pick
out
a
few
words
which
daddy
had
taught
her
could
haltingly
count
the
stars
in
the
heavens
at
night
and
the
on
the
shanty
window
she
could
read
the
names
upon
the
store
signs
and
had
often
seated
herself
on
the
railroad
tracks
with
a
bit
of
newspaper
to
stammer
forth
the
words
she
knew
but
it
was
a
bible
she
needed
to
learn
about
the
student
god
and
the
christ
tess
was
more
interested
in
the
cross
than
the
crown
more
interested
in
the
nails
that
had
opened
the
wounds
in
the
hands
and
feet
than
in
any
royal
that
might
come
in
some
future
time
to
her
there
was
too
much
misery
in
her
own
life
too
much
desperate
desire
for
her
loved
one
to
allow
the
glitter
of
a
promised
crown
to
affect
her
she
wanted
to
know
of
the
suffering
christ
to
read
of
how
he
had
promised
here
tess
stopped
and
tossed
back
the
red
hair
what
was
it
she
wanted
to
read
about
ah
yes
not
heaven
and
its
glories
nor
hell
and
its
terrors
but
of
daddy
skinner
back
in
the
shanty
the
bible
would
tell
her
just
how
to
bring
him
back
but
where
should
she
get
one
at
the
squatter
mission
of
course
tessibel
remembered
that
once
she
had
been
coaxed
to
enter
the
mission
but
the
children
had
laughed
at
her
rags
and
after
that
she
could
not
be
induced
to
go
again
then
in
the
bitterness
of
her
heart
she
had
thrown
stones
and
clay
from
the
edges
of
the
track
through
the
open
window
upon
the
other
children
and
had
been
told
by
the
superintendent
never
to
come
near
the
small
church
again
but
that
was
four
long
months
ago
and
not
once
since
since
the
horror
of
daddy
going
had
she
even
looked
toward
the
mission
the
dusk
fell
slowly
striking
out
the
from
the
railroad
bed
and
she
halted
where
the
two
tracks
met
the
mission
was
opposite
her
would
she
dare
ask
for
a
bible
a
rich
warm
light
flooded
through
the
window
and
then
the
old
squatter
who
had
kept
the
place
in
order
for
many
years
came
out
and
closed
the
door
tessibel
eyes
followed
his
form
through
the
dim
twilight
until
he
disappeared
into
his
shanty
her
hand
clutched
convulsively
the
knob
of
the
mission
door
it
yielded
to
her
touch
and
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
tessibel
skinner
was
inside
the
mission
room
the
small
reed
organ
stood
open
a
hymn
book
stretched
back
with
a
rubber
band
caught
her
eye
a
bright
bit
of
red
carpet
wound
its
way
about
the
altar
the
squatter
did
not
pause
to
examine
the
pictures
on
the
wall
nor
even
an
instant
before
the
glowing
fire
her
eyes
were
searching
for
a
bible
the
shade
deepening
in
them
as
she
sidled
toward
the
nearest
seat
she
read
on
the
back
of
the
first
book
dropping
it
she
gathered
up
another
she
spelled
thrusting
it
into
her
blouse
she
bounded
out
into
the
night
and
raced
up
the
railroad
track
almost
to
the
hoghole
trestle
before
she
stopped
satisfied
that
no
one
had
seen
her
theft
then
taking
the
book
from
her
bosom
she
kissed
it
reverently
them
old
fools
ai
goin
to
have
every
damn
bible
in
this
here
town
i
air
a
right
like
them
to
this
un
again
she
kissed
it
as
she
mumbled
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
that
night
the
candle
burned
longer
in
the
skinner
shanty
and
an
auburn
head
bent
over
an
open
book
a
faltering
voice
spelled
out
the
sufferings
of
the
nazarene
once
tess
smiled
wanly
when
reading
of
how
the
saviour
had
borne
all
the
woes
of
the
world
that
any
one
believing
could
be
saved
her
head
nodded
over
the
pages
and
almost
instantly
the
rapt
face
dropped
upon
the
open
bible
and
tessibel
slept
a
strange
dream
filled
her
sleep
a
great
light
flashed
suddenly
into
the
sky
tessibel
sky
and
through
the
brightness
of
it
she
could
see
the
cross
with
the
man
upon
it
could
see
the
nail
prints
in
the
swollen
flesh
the
thorns
pressing
into
the
bowed
head
then
as
tessibel
dreamed
she
moved
upon
the
open
bible
and
groaned
with
the
upon
the
cross
directly
in
front
of
the
crucified
saviour
daddy
skinner
was
coming
toward
her
with
the
student
she
started
up
a
cry
of
disappointed
anguish
escaping
her
lips
the
candle
had
burned
out
in
the
grease
cup
the
wind
was
rocking
the
shanty
and
making
the
rafters
creak
dismally
tess
shivered
as
she
tossed
her
clothes
upon
the
floor
and
crept
exhausted
into
daddy
bed
the
last
thing
she
heard
was
the
splashing
of
her
pet
eel
in
the
the
next
morning
on
a
piece
of
yellow
paper
she
scratched
daddy
a
small
note
frederick
words
that
her
father
would
be
pleased
with
it
filled
her
with
a
desire
to
write
for
three
hours
she
struggled
with
her
first
letter

over
many
times
with
pardonable
pride

carefully
and
placed
it
in
the
bible
where
she
had

about
the
cross
and

christ
chapter
xix
on
wednesday
evening
deacon
hall
tucked
augusta
pretty
hand
under
his
arm
with
a
happy
sense
of
proprietorship
he
was
proud
to
stand
by
his
beautiful
wife
in
her
fight
for
church
liberty
hall
really
believed
as
he
had
told
dominie
graves
that
the
world
had
outgrown
its
foggy
notions
and
he
delighted
in
hearing
augusta
air
her
ideas
in
meetings
in
watching
the
rich
blood
mantling
and
playing
under
the
transparent
skin
and
in
listening
to
the
modulated
tones
of
the
vibrant
voice
augusta
was
his
style
of
woman
the
thought
of
her
force
of
character
made
him
throw
back
his
shoulders
that
wednesday
evening
as
they
neared
the
church
door
few
members
had
gathered
for
the
hour
was
early
deacon
hall
nodded
pleasantly
to
bill
hopkins
and
a
broad
smile
parted
the
latter
lips
giving
his
square
face
a
softer
more
genial
expression
bill
calmly
took
his
seat
on
the
left
side
of
the
room
crossed
his
legs
placed
his
fingers
about
the
white
wart
and
then
sat
looking
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
into
the
lighted
street
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
bill
hopkins
was
in
his
chair
at
the
weekly
prayer
meeting
his
one
idea
in
being
present
was
to
witness
the
success
in
keeping
the
women
in
their
places
he
had
had
conscientious
scruples
about
remaining
in
a
church
which
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
its
tenets
forbade
its
females
to
rise
and
voice
either
prayers
or
opinions
before
the
males
countenanced
this
very
abuse
bill
hopkins
had
no
objection
to
women
in
their
places
in
fact
he
enjoyed
the
company
of
a
pretty
woman
but
it
was
not
her
place
to
try
and
teach
him
hopkins
had
the
overwhelming
idea
of
the
physical
and
moral
superiority
of
men
while
as
far
as
intellectuality
was
concerned
women
were
leagues
and
leagues
behind
many
a
warm
argument
had
been
held
between
bill
and
the
pretty
hall
and
as
this
lady
came
into
the
chapel
she
saw
the
former
elder
seated
in
his
old
chair
the
familiar
wart
shining
high
and
white
on
the
bald
pate
she
tilted
her
pretty
chin
an
instant
before
inclining
her
head
then
to
the
amazement
of
those
present
she
parted
from
her
husband
in
the
middle
aisle
marching
to
the
right
her
amiable
deacon
taking
the
left
bill
hopkins
smiled
inwardly
as
the
thought
flashed
over
him
that
there
must
have
been
a
secret
female
conclave
among
the
women
as
well
as
among
the
men
during
the
past
week
the
same
idea
occurred
to
the
minister
mind
as
he
saw
his
members
separate
in
the
middle
aisle
he
drew
his
brow
into
a
pucker
which
furrowed
the
flesh
between
his
brows
graves
was
seated
at
the
rear
of
the
room
to
the
right
her
eyes
upon
an
open
book
in
her
hand
she
did
not
raise
them
as
her
husband
took
his
chair
behind
the
small
pulpit
table
upon
which
lay
a
huge
bible
marked
by
a
dangling
blue
ribbon
the
clergyman
bent
his
head
a
few
moments
in
secret
prayer
drew
the
book
toward
him
opened
it
found
his
text
and
placed
the
marker
carefully
between
the
pages
he
coughed
slightly
and
with
an
extra
effort
raised
his
eyes
to
his
congregation
this
is
what
he
saw
the
middle
aisle
divided
almost
every
woman
from
her
husband
only
here
and
there
had
a
timid
wife
with
lowered
eyes
followed
her
lord
and
master
to
the
left
dominie
graves
caught
a
peculiar
gleam
in
the
eye
of
augusta
hall
and
followed
the
line
of
her
vision
which
was
leveled
at
bill
hopkins
there
was
no
enmity
in
the
latter
mien
but
dominie
graves
knew
that
when
the
elderly
deacon
toyed
with
the
white
wart
his
nerves
were
vastly
disturbed
for
an
instant
the
thought
traveled
through
the
brain
that
if
tessibel
skinner
could
work
with
her
magic
words
on
the
dull
protrusion
upon
hopkins
glistening
head
the
former
deacon
would
lose
his
favorite
occupation
he
looked
doubtfully
down
upon
his
own
hands
and
remembered
the
warts
which
tessibel
had
whispered
away
then
trying
to
drive
all
thoughts
of
the
and
her
squatter
father
from
his
mind
the
minister
rose
to
his
feet
frederick
graves
had
been
watching
his
father
intently
and
as
he
saw
his
effort
to
rise
the
boy
whitened
a
little
and
settled
back
just
growing
into
manhood
and
beginning
to
think
for
himself
the
lad
blushed
with
shame
at
the
state
of
affairs
that
rose
before
his
eyes
this
night
he
threw
a
sidelong
glance
at
hopkins
and
met
a
dejected
expression
from
the
eyes
of
his
mother
she
looked
so
tired
so
humiliated
that
a
bitter
rebellious
feeling
arose
in
frederick
heart
against
his
father
then
his
mind
wandered
again
from
the
church
to
tessibel
skinner
in
her
shanty
home
the
quick
look
she
had
given
him
in
the
had
impressed
him
as
nothing
else
could
he
saw
again
the
bright
head
thrown
back
in
eager
appeal
and
the
shining
eyes
filled
with
pain
how
he
wished
that
his
own
faith
in
the
infinite
had
a
touch
of
the
strength
which
made
that
of
tessibel
stand
alone
by
itself
little
did
frederick
realize
or
know
that
the
intensity
of
the
fishermaid
the
wonderful
faith
and
trust
she
had
exhibited
in
her
time
of
trial
and
trouble
had
come
to
her
from
him
every
prayer
tessibel
had
uttered
every
devout
wish
of
her
heart
for
daddy
skinner
had
been
vaguely
centered
about
the
student
her
love
for
the
christ
of
whom
she
had
heard
so
little
was
based
upon
the
power
of
attraction
that
frederick
graves
held
for
her
twice
had
he
unobserved
seen
tessibel
through
the
hut
window
and
the
picture
of
the
tired
little
figure
with
its
drooping
prayerful
attitude
came
back
with
a
force
that
brought
a
great
lump
into
his
throat
invigorating
his
desire
to
raise
the
standard
of
his
own
love
for
words
and
promises
his
father
eloquent
voice
brought
him
back
to
the
present
and
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
hopkins
he
saw
the
nervous
fingers
twiddling
the
great
white
wart
and
a
smile
forced
itself
to
his
lips
then
he
dragged
his
truant
mind
from
outside
subjects
and
concentrated
his
attention
upon
the
pulpit
in
accordance
with
the
creed
of
the
church
the
clergyman
was
saying
and
of
the
laws
under
which
our
beloved
congregation
holds
together
i
speak
it
is
with
love
for
all
i
adjure
you
this
night
when
i
say
that
the
subject
of
my
talk
will
be
upon
duty
you
will
not
be
surprised
for
you
one
and
all
know
what
i
mean
i
shall
ask
the
sisters
in
the
church
not
to
rise
again
to
speak
if
they
desire
church
work
there
are
the
poor
the
blind
and
always
the
needy
by
needy
i
mean
those
desiring
the
faith
of
god
and
yet
being
unable
to
grasp
it
without
help
to
the
dear
sisters
of
the
congregation
i
commend
all
these
he
made
no
allusion
to
the
division
of
the
men
and
women
nor
to
the
sermon
of
the
past
sunday
after
the
hymn
he
sat
down
bowing
his
handsome
dark
head
quietly
and
remaining
mute
in
the
dismal
silence
that
followed
suddenly
an
elderly
woman
with
a
meek
face
struggled
to
her
feet
glancing
toward
augusta
hall
for
an
encouraging
smile
several
trimmed
hats
however
loomed
up
between
her
and
the
deacon
wife
so
still
standing
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
began
to
pray
simultaneously
with
hers
a
masculine
voice
broke
through
the
air
mingling
with
the
weak
petition
of
the
woman
frederick
graves
lifted
his
head
quickly
the
trend
of
war
cutting
through
his
mind
like
a
knife
it
had
evidently
been
planned
before
the
meeting
just
how
severely
the
women
were
to
be
dealt
with
for
frederick
noted
that
his
father
eyes
did
not
raise
from
his
reverent
position
at
the
unusual
happening
as
the
man
voice
grew
louder
importunately
seeking
guidance
in
this
unhappy
church
affair
the
woman
closed
her
lips
and
fell
backward
upon
the
seat
crying
weakly
the
masculine
voice
rose
higher
and
clearer
and
finished
the
petition
with
ringing
clarity
another
embarrassing
silence
out
of
which
came
scarcely
a
breath
augusta
hall
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
piercing
blue
eyes
peering
from
under
the
shaggy
brows
of
bill
hopkins
the
deacon
was
watching
her
and
augusta
knew
that
he
exulted
as
one
woman
after
another
was
driven
to
her
chair
by
the
masculine
voice
of
her
shouting
opponent
so
far
the
men
held
the
day
this
was
demonstrated
to
augusta
hall
and
bill
hopkins
by
the
undertoned
sobs
that
continually
emerged
from
behind
the
numerous
white
handkerchiefs
so
dense
was
the
quietude
of
the
painful
meeting
that
frederick
graves
could
plainly
hear
the
thumping
of
his
own
heart
suddenly
augusta
with
a
slight
cough
and
a
rustle
of
her
fine
skirts
rose
to
her
feet
she
started
to
speak
reverently
in
a
low
tone
it
was
the
usual
petition
that
blessing
should
descend
upon
the
missions
the
sewing
circle
and
the
children
work
and
here
her
voice
wavered
a
little
for
a
man
bass
voice
joined
in
with
her
own
it
was
that
of
the
deacon
who
carried
the
offering
plate
each
sunday
morning
opposite
her
husband
on
and
on
both
man
and
woman
shouted
their
words
with
strength
and
rapidity
upon
their
hearers
ears
the
deacon
voice
lifted
and
fell
with
the
power
of
an
orator
augusta
strained
forth
her
tones
high
and
clear
minute
after
minute
until
fifteen
had
passed
was
the
oratorical
word
display
of
each
pitted
against
the
other
dominie
graves
fingers
were
twitching
nervously
beside
his
nose
bill
hopkins
still
twiddling
his
wart
had
drawn
himself
to
a
straighter
position
and
was
listening
with
all
intentness
the
pallor
of
deacon
hall
face
deepened
as
augusta
talked
on
and
on
until
all
thought
of
prayer
had
left
her
mind
and
her
words
shaped
themselves
into
a
discourse
she
was
holding
the
floor
against
the
church
official
whose
brow
was
now
running
with
the
sweat
of
his
embarrassment
his
voice
had
become
fainter
and
his
words
fewer
and
less
well
chosen
augusta
voice
on
the
contrary
rang
clearly
through
the
room
a
prepared
speech
upon
the
aptitude
of
women
and
their
field
of
labor
her
husband
was
watching
her
intently
and
thought
how
beautiful
she
looked
as
the
blood
mantled
to
her
white
forehead
descending
and
rising
as
her
thoughts
took
turn
after
turn
the
unfortunate
deacon
was
mumbling
forth
a
few
sentences
at
last
with
a
groan
he
sank
to
his
seat
and
placed
a
handkerchief
to
his
fevered
brow
presently
augusta
sat
down
and
there
was
again
an
awful
silence
no
one
advanced
another
petition
and
dominie
graves
pronounced
a
halting
benediction
the
congregation
rose
hastily
and
hurried
toward
the
doors
with
no
desire
for
further
discussion
bill
hopkins
leaned
back
against
the
outer
door
and
as
hall
passed
him
he
grasped
her
hand
you
had
nerve
said
he
i
not
saying
it
the
right
kind
but
it
nerve
just
the
same
and
well
i
do
believe
that
you
women
have
gained
the
day
in
this
church
augusta
leaning
on
her
husband
arm
looked
down
meekly
from
a
pair
of
wicked
twinkling
eyes
she
could
be
a
sweet
clinging
creature
if
she
wished
and
this
was
her
special
charm
to
deacon
hall
suddenly
she
raised
her
gaze
and
looked
winningly
into
bill
face
i
suppose
you
wo
give
me
the
money
i
asked
you
for
to
aid
skinner
she
said
slowly
i
send
you
the
check
morning
and
bill
hopkins
big
shoulders
disappeared
through
the
open
door
it
frightened
me
at
first
exclaimed
deacon
hall
to
his
wife
afterward
but
as
your
voice
went
up
and
up
i
knew
my
little
woman
would
win
god
bless
her
and
we
win
about
poor
skinner
too
rejoined
augusta
every
man
and
woman
so
far
has
agreed
to
help
a
little
and
i
do
want
you
to
try
to
drive
the
squatters
from
our
lake
property
here
her
words
were
checked
by
a
sudden
thought
which
darkened
her
eyes
she
burst
forth
with
a
rich
low
laugh
that
make
two
triumphs
over
my
haughty
parson
chapter
xx
a
sense
of
embarrassment
accompanied
dominie
graves
to
the
breakfast
table
the
next
morning
after
the
triumphant
victory
of
augusta
hall
he
made
no
remark
upon
the
disagreeable
episode
of
the
previous
night
and
ate
silently
amid
the
chatter
of
babe
and
the
monosyllabic
answers
of
her
mother
teola
to
break
the
strain
spoke
of
the
and
dance
coming
off
that
evening
i
fear
it
will
be
too
cold
objected
graves
in
her
fretful
weary
voice
i
can
wrap
up
warmly
argued
teola
all
the
girls
in
town
are
going
and
dan
will
take
care
of
me
we
are
going
in
separate
sleighs
to
slaterville
i
going
mother
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
growing
rather
friendly
with
that
young
jordan
teola
her
father
said
he
been
here
every
night
for
a
week
has
he
teola
muttered
sullenly
that
she
was
the
only
girl
in
town
who
had
callers
and
looked
pleadingly
to
frederick
for
aid
the
young
student
flashed
her
a
smile
teola
will
be
perfectly
safe
father
he
exclaimed
are
you
going
no
answered
frederick
but
sister
would
be
no
safer
if
i
were
i
have
implicit
confidencs
in
dan
jordan
and
the
country
roads
are
perfect
by
the
way
dan
would
like
to
take
a
class
of
boys
in
the
sunday
school
i
told
him
to
see
you
about
it
the
mollified
minister
finished
his
meal
without
further
comment
the
was
a
thing
of
the
past
that
it
had
brought
disaster
to
teola
graves
showed
in
the
tired
eyes
as
they
rested
on
the
sky
gray
with
the
coming
morning
she
had
stolen
silently
into
the
house
reaching
her
chamber
without
disturbing
either
father
or
mother
at
the
window
she
halted
here
and
there
a
star
sparkled
dying
dim
in
the
advancing
sky
teola
eyes
rested
upon
the
street
below
for
several
minutes
then
dragged
her
gaze
upward
and
beyond
beyond
to
the
long
road
that
led
to
the
yard
of
the
dead
which
stretched
over
the
hillside
rearing
its
monuments
among
the
leafless
trees
like
sentinels
over
sleeping
soldiers
there
was
something
alluring
something
compelling
to
the
pale
girl
watching
the
birth
of
her
first
real
day
of
living
the
university
frowned
down
upon
the
graveyard
in
its
turn
the
graveyard
frowned
menacingly
upon
the
town
a
peeped
a
to
its
mate
in
the
rectory
eaves
a
bell
pealed
out
twice
striking
the
air
with
its
sonorous
sound
reverberating
into
the
hills
and
still
the
girl
stood
waiting
for
she
knew
not
what
yesterday
girlhood
offered
teola
graves
happy
hours
of
peaceful
meditation
the
new
day
brought
the
woman
its
ceaseless
silent
agony
of
regret
and
remorse
strong
forces
of
which
she
had
known
nothing
if
dan
were
only
glad
that
she
loved
him
if
he
loved
her
in
return
suddenly
tears
welled
into
the
dark
eyes
teola
graves
hid
her
face
from
the
new
world
of
painful
joy
and
forgot
in
sleep
teola
next
hour
with
her
lover
was
the
most
embarrassing
one
of
her
life
dan
took
her
hands
in
silence
and
the
seriousness
of
his
face
bespoke
his
heart
pain
sweetheart
is
there
anything
in
all
the
world
that
i
can
say
to
you
to
make
you
love
me
more
precious
precious
little
darling
only
say
that
you
do
love
me
dan
breathed
teola
and
and
do
turn
your
eyes
away
from
me
sweetheart

teola
study
so
hard
dearest
and
when
i
finish
college

home

our
own
teola
forgive
me
and
have
faith
in
me
will
you
sweet
yes
murmured
the
trembling
lips
and
teola
buried
her
flushed
face
upon
the
broad
breast
of
dan
jordan
and
was
happy
frederick
graves
had
been
made
president
of
the
freshman
class
a
short
time
after
entering
the
cranium
fraternity
he
was
considered
by
most
of
his
fellow
students
a
serious
earnest
worker
and
had
been
taken
many
times
into
consultation
with
the
upper
classmen
concerning
plans
for
the
development
of
the
society
in
past
years
at
the
end
of
every
january
the
freshmen
had
held
a
banquet
in
the
of
the
city
this
event
called
forth
practical
jokes
of
all
descriptions
upon
the
men
from
the
sophomores
and
seniors
giving
many
anxious
and
worried
moments
to
the
younger
students
over
the
outcome
of
the
one
important
event
of
the
year
it
had
also
been
the
custom
to
try
to
capture
the
president
of
the
freshman
class
and
hold
him
in
seclusion
until
after
the
banquet
thereby
making
his
opening
speech
impossible
the
dread
that
they
should
lose
their
leader
became
more
and
more
apparent
among
the
banquet
holders
as
the
days
advanced
and
extensive
plans
had
been
made
to
protect
frederick
graves
from
his
class
enemies
for
one
whole
month
previous
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
walk
alone
about
the
town
and
it
had
been
ordered
that
he
should
sleep
at
the
fraternity
house
instead
of
at
the
rectory
in
order
that
the
young
president
might
be
guarded
against
any
surprise
concocted
by
the
sophomores
one
evening
at
the
cranium
society
several
freshmen
were
seated
in
the
it
a
great
note
muttered
shorty
brown
that
we
have
to
wait
on
those
big
lubbers
of
sophomores
and
seniors
i
as
soon
die
as
to
run
down
the
hill
after
their
letters
you
might
as
well
go
shorts
put
in
spuddy
preston
you
only
get
yourself
disliked
if
you
do
and
you
be
made
to
go
in
the
end
the
blessing
of
it
all
is
that
they
did
the
same
thing
in
their
turn
he
took
a
slow
measure
of
the
distance
between
himself
and
the
cuspidor
and
shot
a
piece
of
gum
into
it
it
does
make
it
any
pleasanter
put
in
swipes
dillon
just
think
of
me
i
have
had
a
cent
to
spend
on
myself
for
weeks
capacity
for
smoke
is
enormous
i
wish
i
had
knocked
his
head
clean
off
his
neck
he
looked
gloomily
out
of
the
window
as
he
muttered
this
but
instantly
brightened
as
he
finished
but
i
can
stand
almost
anything
if
they
do
get
hold
of
graves
that
would
spoil
our
fun
altogether
he
unbent
the
small
round
body
drawn
up
in
a
ball
sitting
up
to
hear
what
the
others
had
to
say
just
let
them
take
him
growled
shorty
brown
we
will
make
it
warm
for
those
sophs
but
they
such
sneaks
that
we
ca
put
a
trust
in
them
why
do
you
say
something
captain
nothing
to
say
boy
replied
jordan
musingly
only
that
we
must
do
all
we
can
to
shield
frederick
if
they
once
get
him
we
wo
see
him
until
after
the
banquet
i
fear
too
they
might
hurt
him
for
he
would
be
sure
to
put
up
a
fight
so
would
i
boasted
spuddy
you
bet
i
would
swipes
broke
into
a
ringing
laugh
you
make
a
nice
fighter
spud
he
chuckled
you
not
bigger
than
a
minute
with
fifty
seconds
in
it
gosh
i
wish
something
would
happen
i
tired
sitting
about
doing
nothing
his
words
came
to
dan
jordan
through
a
dim
maze
of
tangled
thoughts
during
all
his
short
happy
life
anxiety
had
never
been
his
companion
until
now
it
strangled
his
class
ardor
and
made
conscientious
study
impossible
teola
graves
tearful
face
rose
constantly
before
him
his
own
eyes
darkened
at
the
thought
oh
to
go
back
to
the
toffy
pull
to
live
over
again
those
last
few
weeks
how
different
it
all
would
be
and
how
repentant
he
was
he
sighed
and
shook
his
great
shoulders
and
rose
to
his
feet
i
wonder
where
graves
is
now
he
exclaimed
i
met
armstrong
and
howe
coming
up
the
hill
last
night
talking
with
their
heads
close
together
i
noticed
that
they
stopped
suddenly
when
i
came
upon
them
the
blood
had
crept
accusingly
into
his
face
as
he
spoke
name
never
for
one
moment
in
the
presence
of
teola
brother
had
he
forgotten
how
could
he
ever
forget
but
he
did
love
teola
graves
madly
and
wished
with
all
his
soul
that
he
were
through
college
he
had
hoped
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
banquet
his
remorse
would
be
quieted
a
little
but
his
conscience
lashed
him
so
constantly
with
that
it
seemed
imperative
for
him
to
give
up
his
studies
marry
teola
and
take
her
away
let
all
go
down
town
cried
swipes
in
a
loud
tone
with
a
side
wink
at
spuddy
and
get
boiling
drunk
if
something
does
happen
lordy
groaned
spuddy
swipes
is
always
wanting
something
to
happen
i
bet
it
will
before
long
what
you
wish
for
you
get
old
horse
do
forget
that
spuddy
went
on
tapping
the
window
staring
out
into
the
gloom
we
better
go
down
town
and
look
for
graves
and
see
that
he
is
all
right
said
dan
that
will
be
enough
for
you
kids
to
do
now
it
your
evening
anyway
to
guard
him
the
four
freshmen
walked
down
the
hill
together
dan
separated
from
the
three
at
the
ithaca
hotel
with
the
injunction
that
they
should
keep
their
eyes
open
for
the
young
president
guarding
him
while
the
other
night
watchers
were
having
a
play
spell
on
the
next
corner
dan
jordan
ran
into
frederick
with
two
of
his
own
classmates
you
fellows
can
go
now
exclaimed
dan
to
frederick
companions
brown
preston
and
dillon
are
just
up
there
on
the
next
corner
to
protect
graves
while
you
fellows
go
to
supper
how
are
things
going
now
frederick
a
sinking
sensation
attacked
his
heart
as
he
asked
this
question
and
he
remembered
afterwards
that
he
had
expected
frederick
to
impart
ill
news
to
him
the
fear
had
come
from
his
conscience
everything
is
all
right
but
teola
wants
to
see
you
could
you
go
down
for
a
little
while
dan
nodded
and
turned
with
a
happier
heart
toward
the
rectory
leaving
frederick
looking
for
spuddy
shorts
and
swipes
chapter
xxi
three
hours
afterwards
the
three
little
freshmen
walked
arm
in
arm
up
the
long
hill
toward
the
university
campus
shorts
had
a
shaky
grasp
of
one
arm
of
dillon
and
spuddy
the
other
on
through
the
cold
night
they
dragged
him
until
they
reached
the
broad
white
carriage
way
that
led
to
the
fraternity
house
here
swipes
stumbled
loosening
himself
from
the
grasp
of
his
companions
well
ju
just
look
at
him
growled
spuddy
in
a
disgusted
tone
he
ought
to
freeze

a
more
sober
manner
look
there
spud
the
whole

after
midnight
and
the

swipes
in
a
low
thick
voice
i
i
want

tha
that
what
i
want
to
do
he
sank
into
a
stupor
again
but
the
boys
dragged
him
to
his
feet
do
you
want
jordan
and
graves
to
see
you
like
this
swipes
demanded
shorts
stopping
in
the
center
of
the
carriage
drive
if
you
do
you
take
a
mighty
quick
sneak
up
the
back
stairs
and
the
sentence
was
never
finished
for
the
door
opened
and
dan
jordan
big
form
loomed
up
before
their
dazed
eyes
is
that
you
shorts
called
dan
yes
where
have
you
been
for
the
last
three
hours
down
there
mumbled
shorts
in
a
smothered
tone
desiring
to
hide
their
plight
if
possible
for
the
love
of
all
that
good
shorts
groaned
spuddy
let
me
get
into
the
house
and
change
my
clothes
there
goes
swipes
again
in
the
snow
get
up
fool
here
the
to
to
the
devil
with
the
muttered
swipes
but
dan
next
sentence
completely
awoke
the
senses
of
all
save
swipes
he
only
grasped
it
dimly
through
the
cobwebs
of
his
drunken
brain
where
graves
demanded
jordan
coming
to
the
top
step
the
silence
that
followed
was
as
grim
as
the
falling
snow
spuddy
and
shorts
were
dragging
the
limp
swipes
up
the
long
steps
graves
we
have
seen
him
interjected
shorty
brown
and
dan
jordan
answered
gravely
then
the
sophomores
have
captured
him
that
a
certainty
he
been
here
and
he
has
been
to
the
rectory
shorts
now
thoroughly
sober
followed
the
big
freshman
into
the
where
a
dozen
or
more
boys
were
curled
up
on
divans
swipes
was
being
urged
up
the
broad
oak
stairs
spuddy
now
and
then
giving
him
a
severe
poke
in
the
ribs
preston
perched
the
hapless
boy
against
his
chamber
door
with
the
injunction
to
get
to
bed
the
best
he
could
swipes
turned
helplessly
to
his
look
here
spuddy
help
a
fellow
will
you
just
give
me
my
pyjamas
get
them
yourself
retorted
preston
shoving
dillon
into
his
it
a
nice
mess
we
in
with
the
gone
with
a
disgusted
kick
at
swipes
he
left
him
reeling
desperately
once
more
dillon
swayed
forward
from
the
center
of
the
room
toward
the
doorway
he
had
heard
as
in
a
dream
spuddy
parting
shot
about
fellows
getting
drunk
and
forgetting
how
to
act
suddenly
the
floor
rose
up
and
hit
him
on
the
nose
but
the
polished
boards
so
bright
that
he
could
see
his
face
in
them
fell
back
politely
leaving
swipes
standing
looking
helplessly
about
him
every
piece
of
furniture
bed
bureau
table
and
chairs
flew
around
and
around
him
in
the
wildest
disorder
his
eyes
reeled
after
them
in
their
flight
through
the
room
around
and
around
past
the
bed
to
the
door
once
swipes
thought
they
would
fly
through
bracing
himself
to
catch
the
flying
bed
he
came
up
with
a
bang
against
the
beveled
mirror
which
broke
and
splintered
under
his
weight
he
was
lying
in
the
ruins
when
some
one
came
and
put
him
to
bed
the
regret
of
the
little
freshman
the
next
morning
when
the
dismal
news
of
the
missing
president
came
to
him
was
intensely
genuine
they
told
him
that
the
whole
town
had
been
searched
but
that
graves
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
if
he
were
no
longer
on
the
earth
when
dan
jordan
left
frederick
graves
on
the
corner
of
ithaca
main
street
the
young
president
began
to
search
for
his
three
classmates
shorts
and
the
other
two
must
be
somewhere
near
for
dan
had
told
him
so
he
turned
to
the
left
walking
toward
jay
resort
where
with
his
knowledge
of
the
three
little
freshmen
habits
he
would
probably
find
them
it
was
a
nuisance
to
be
followed
about
and
guarded
as
if
he
were
a
criminal
yet
he
would
go
through
anything
rather
than
be
absent
from
the
banquet
suddenly
he
felt
a
bag
thrown
over
his
head
and
he
was
dragged
completely
off
his
feet
then
with
much
force
he
was
shoved
into
a
carriage
a
heavy
hand
held
over
his
mouth
he
heard
a
pair
of
horses
whipped
into
rapid
motion
frederick
could
not
imagine
in
which
direction
he
was
being
driven
for
the
constant
turning
of
corners
made
it
seem
to
the
smothered
boy
that
they
were
tearing
around
in
a
circle
suddenly
the
vehicle
came
to
a
sharp
standstill
during
the
ride
his
ankles
and
wrists
had
been
tightly
corded
and
no
sooner
had
the
carriage
halted
than
several
pairs
of
hands
carried
him
swiftly
up
a
flight
of
stairs
into
a
house
and
along
a
carpetless
hall
when
the
cloth
was
removed
from
his
head
frederick
was
in
the
presence
of
two
sophomores
mathew
armstrong
and
paul
howe
hard
luck
said
armstrong
looking
at
frederick
with
a
grin
rather
he
replied
glancing
about
but
what
ca
be
cured
must
be
endured
if
i
am
to
stay
here
i
hope
i
am
to
be
fed
not
with
banquet
cake
freddy
laughed
howe
you
have
plain
bread
until
after
the
banquet
now
just
give
us
your
coat
and
vest
old
chap
and
your
collar
and
tie
frederick
ready
obedience
made
armstrong
exclaim
jovially
that
the
right
attitude
is
it
howe
no
one
would
think
to
look
at
you
graves
that
you
were
so
docile
you
knew
what
you
were
saying
when
you
said
could
be
cured
must
be
endured
and
i
say
fair
in
love
and
war
so
you
stay
here
until
after
that
grand
supper
without
answering
frederick
turned
his
eyes
gloomily
about
his
prison
the
room
was
almost
bare
in
one
corner
was
a
bed
in
another
a
cot
with
some
blankets
upon
it
a
long
window
ran
nearly
to
the
floor
minus
a
blind
on
one
side
while
on
the
other
a
green
shutter
hung
by
one
hinge
making
a
creaking
noise
as
the
wind
swung
it
back
and
forth
frederick
reasoned
that
the
window
faced
the
street
for
he
could
hear
crunching
footsteps
in
the
hard
snow
as
pedestrians
passed
a
wagon
rolled
squeakingly
by
and
all
was
quiet
in
the
night
frederick
endeavored
to
plan
his
escape
he
believed
the
house
to
be
within
the
city
limits
but
during
the
long
dark
drive
he
had
lost
all
sense
of
direction
through
the
flickering
of
the
smoky
lamp
he
saw
armstrong
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand
watching
him
intently
so
the
darkness
passed
and
the
daylight
came
in
at
the
window
throwing
long
slant
rays
upon
the
dusty
floor
and
lighting
the
faded
paper
on
the
wall
chapter
xxii
dominie
graves
had
a
consultation
with
dan
jordan
over
the
disappearance
of
his
son
and
then
climbed
the
university
hill
to
professor
office
i
feel
sure
that
frederick
has
not
been
harmed
said
graves
after
greeting
the
professor
but
there
was
question
in
his
voice
an
expression
of
deep
concern
spread
over
young
face
i
heartily
hope
not
responded
he
for
i
know
of
no
finer
young
man
in
the
university
i
think
the
boy
would
put
up
a
great
fight
if
he
had
a
chance
resumed
the
minister
but
with
a
lot
of
fellows
against
him
one
chap
ca
do
much
i
hardly
know
what
to
think
there
seems
to
be
nothing
to
do
but
to
await
his
return
young
jordan
said
last
night
that
they
had
searched
every
place
where
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
but
the
boy
was
not
to
be
found
his
mother
is
growing
anxious
i
should
think
that
she
would
be
worried
replied
young
it
a
beastly
practise
this
stealing
of
the
freshman
president
and
unworthy
of
such
a
college
as
this
i
shall
be
glad
when
it
is
abolished
there
is
nothing
during
the
year
that
creates
such
furore
as
this
banquet
a
file
of
papers
was
under
professor
young
hand
and
as
he
spoke
he
toyed
with
one
of
the
long
official
envelopes
dominie
graves
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
words
that
made
the
color
rush
hot
into
his
face
the
envelope
contained
an
appeal
for
a
new
trial
for
orn
skinner
he
coughed
slightly
and
opened
a
new
topic
i
see
you
are
still
interested
in
skinner
yes
have
you
succeeded
in
getting
him
a
new
trial
not
yet
but
at
any
hour
i
expect
to
hear
that
the
governor
will
give
me
an
opportunity
to
defend
him
i
fully
believe
that
the
man
is
innocent
that
he
ought
to
have
another
chance
for
his
life
as
i
said
in
the
the
squatter
trials
are
but
farces
i
do
approve
of
them
you
but
a
stranger
in
our
town
interposed
the
dominie
when
you
been
here
as
long
as
i
have
professor
young
you
will
see
that
the
strictest
measures
are
necessary
with
these
people
the
rope
is
none
too
good
for
that
man
skinner
god
forbid
ejaculated
young
that
i
should
live
ever
to
wish
away
a
man
life
on
any
personal
motive
tessibel
sweet
upturned
face
shrouded
in
hair
rose
before
him
but
it
did
not
obscure
the
dark
flush
that
swept
over
the
handsome
face
of
the
minister
the
professor
had
intimated
that
he
thought
personal
motives
were
being
used
to
persecute
the
squatter
this
tried
the
patience
of
elias
graves
as
he
sat
gathering
an
argument
to
refute
the
accusation
he
had
even
persuaded
himself
that
it
was
for
the
good
of
the
town
to
remove
one
after
another
of
the
loathsome
fishermen
either
by
the
rope
or
imprisonment
without
their
men
the
squatter
women
also
would
disappear
from
the
shores
he
rose
with
a
sense
of
coming
evil
stealing
over
him
for
the
man
seated
opposite
was
a
tower
of
strength
and
his
own
position
in
the
town
had
been
weakened
in
the
late
church
conflict
the
reins
of
affairs
were
being
swept
from
his
hands
he
could
not
speak
out
more
emphatically
than
he
had
against
skinner
on
all
sides
friends
were
rising
to
rescue
the
fisherman
from
the
hangman
noose
if
he
himself
could
gain
a
few
strong
friends
he
would
be
able
to
sweep
the
squatter
from
the
face
of
the
earth
as
he
walked
toward
the
rectory
after
leaving
professor
young
he
set
his
teeth
hard
these
thoughts
rushing
through
his
mind
and
inflaming
his
desire
to
rule
in
ithaca
as
he
always
had
even
his
anxiety
about
frederick
was
obscured
by
the
multitudinous
plans
that
one
after
another
were
born
in
his
brain
he
closed
the
library
door
of
the
rectory
with
an
annoyed
air
and
dropped
into
an
to
think
professor
young
sat
long
after
the
departure
of
dominie
graves
looking
at
the
bundle
of
papers
in
his
hand
he
had
not
dared
to
venture
to
the
skinner
hut
although
his
heart
called
constantly
for
the
girl
who
was
holding
the
shanty
home
against
her
enemies
he
knew
that
tess
was
living
as
best
she
could
existing
on
the
meager
fare
allotted
to
her
kind
young
had
seen
tessibel
but
once
since
her
father
had
been
taken
to
auburn
prison
and
his
face
flushed
as
he
thought
that
in
a
few
days
he
would
be
able
to
tell
her
that
her
daddy
had
received
a
stay
upon
his
execution
that
he
honestly
believed
the
shadowing
rope
would
never
seek
the
beloved
head
again
it
was
only
of
late
that
deforest
young
would
allow
himself
to
admit
that
tessibel
skinner
had
a
stronger
hold
upon
him
than
he
ever
thought
possible
for
any
woman
to
obtain
much
less
a
child
of
such
a
race
he
knew
now
that
his
life
interest
lay
in
making
a
woman
of
her
a
woman
such
as
only
tess
could
make
with
her
deep
primeval
nature
and
splendid
soul
if
the
girl
could
but
return
his
love
in
part
it
would
place
him
in
a
position
to
help
and
educate
her
but
his
great
growing
love
gave
birth
to
a
fear
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
awaken
in
the
squatter
girl
a
soul
affection
for
himself
nevertheless
he
would
spare
nothing
to
elevate
her
he
expected
a
hard
task
to
prove
skinner
not
guilty
and
every
hour
he
hoped
to
receive
a
letter
from
the
governor
of
the
state
giving
him
the
desired
year
to
gain
the
necessary
evidence
in
favor
of
the
fisherman
he
was
still
meditating
in
this
strain
when
the
governor
letter
was
handed
to
him
for
almost
an
hour
he
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
building
an
imaginary
home
which
he
had
never
thought
would
be
his
and
in
still
sweeter
imaginings
he
held
close
to
his
heart
a
fair
sweet
girl
growing
into
her
heritage
of
womanhood
for
two
whole
days
frederick
graves
had
been
held
a
captive
in
his
unfurnished
prison
he
knew
that
hours
marked
the
time
before
the
banquet
also
that
if
he
could
not
escape
before
then
he
would
have
to
be
absent
from
the
class
dinner
only
once
had
armstrong
spoken
to
him
that
day
and
an
expression
of
fine
scorn
upon
the
handsome
president
face
had
been
the
answer
the
sophomore
was
stretched
out
upon
the
bed
the
revolver
still
in
his
hand
and
drumming
with
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
upon
the
much
soiled
wall
graves
he
began
if
you
think
this
is
any
snap
for
me
or
that
i
like
my
job
you
mistaken
i
hate
to
be
cooped
up
here
as
much
as
you
do
frederick
might
not
have
been
within
hearing
of
the
words
for
all
the
attention
he
paid
to
the
speaker
armstrong
sat
up
straight
with
a
deep
yawn
come
on
graves
implored
he
let
play
cards
it
hanged
dismal
with
nothing
to
do
still
frederick
kept
his
dignified
silence
he
looked
down
upon
his
coatless
arms
and
pondered
then
raised
his
eyes
to
the
long
window
but
settled
them
again
upon
his
boots
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
his
jailer
place
the
revolver
upon
the
table
it
roused
him
suddenly
for
he
was
getting
desperate
to
escape
with
rapidity
he
made
up
his
mind
to
action
lunging
forward
he
brought
his
right
fist
in
heavy
contact
with
his
companion
nose
while
the
strong
left
hand
swept
the
revolver
under
the
opposite
bed
simultaneously
with
the
sound
of
the
falling
weapon
came
the
crash
of
broken
glass
frederick
graves
had
swept
like
a
young
hurricane
through
the
long
window
the
falling
of
the
heavy
body
and
running
footsteps
brought
armstrong
hastily
to
his
feet
he
dazedly
brushed
back
a
lock
of
hair
from
his
brow
scrambled
back
under
the
bed
after
the
gun
then
rushed
to
the
broken
window
by
gosh
that
was
brave
ejaculated
he
three
times
he
fired
the
pistol
into
the
night
the
signal
of
trouble
to
give
to
his
classmates
then
sat
down
and
waited
disgustedly
nursing
his
bruised
nose
frederick
landed
in
the
street
stunned
for
a
single
instant
but
the
snow
was
soft
and
the
moment
critical
he
gathered
himself
up
rubbed
off
the
blood
that
trickled
from
his
fingers
and
broke
through
the
street
on
a
run
he
found
himself
in
the
lower
portion
of
the
town
not
far
from
the
leigh
valley
tracks
to
go
eastward
toward
home
would
attract
attention
for
he
was
without
hat
coat
or
vest
and
it
would
probably
lead
to
his
recapture
he
crossed
the
inlet
bridge
passing
a
man
here
and
there
who
stared
after
him
as
if
he
were
a
shade
which
had
risen
from
its
grave
seeking
some
kindred
soul
to
haunt
as
frederick
passed
the
lighted
squatter
mission
the
thought
of
the
warmth
within
made
his
teeth
chatter
he
would
have
given
much
to
have
been
able
to
place
his
cold
hands
over
the
fire
which
burned
brightly
in
the
room
suddenly
he
stopped
in
his
rapid
flight
for
liberty
for
stepping
to
the
tracks
directly
in
front
of
him
was
the
squatter
girl
she
had
not
noticed
him
and
the
student
knew
that
she
was
homeward
bound
tessibel
skinner
the
girl
stopped
electrified
and
tossed
up
her
head
tessibel
skinner
called
frederick
again
when
the
girl
recognized
him
she
came
toward
him
with
the
awkward
conscious
gait
of
a
maid
walking
before
the
man
she
loved
her
eyes
took
in
the
form
of
the
student
with
one
hasty
glance
what
air
the
matter
she
asked
in
an
undertone
had
the
student
been
brought
face
to
face
with
a
dilemma
like
that
of
daddy
skinner
with
the
instincts
of
a
squatter
tess
could
think
of
nothing
that
would
intimidate
but
the
law
i
have
just
escaped
replied
frederick
shivering
then
he
was
in
danger
he
needed
her
as
she
had
needed
him
and
tess
had
no
doubt
but
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
her
shanty
to
ask
her
aid
ye
air
runnin
from
some
bloke
she
demanded
slyly
yes
but
ye
air
cold
said
she
ye
ca
walk
four
miles
without
a
coat
where
are
you
going
to
take
me
frederick
scented
a
place
of
safety
to
my
hut
replied
the
squatter
stoically
wait
ye
stop
here
a
minute
she
bounded
into
the
road
from
the
railway
tracks
leaving
frederick
staring
helplessly
after
her
at
the
door
of
the
mission
she
halted
with
the
slyness
that
had
been
taught
her
from
the
cradle
bending
her
head
forward
to
ascertain
if
any
person
were
witness
of
her
action
she
opened
the
door
and
fled
like
a
young
deer
toward
the
organ
then
ripping
the
crimson
cloth
from
the
altar
she
fled
out
again
into
the
night
running
pantingly
toward
the
student
it
air
for
you
put
it
on
she
ordered
proffering
him
the
embroidered
spread
where
did
you
hesitated
frederick
put
it
on
i
say
i
fan
it
back
some
time
if
ye
will
ye
freeze
with
that
and
there
air
bacon
fish
and
bread
in
the
hut
her
voice
was
low
and
vibrant
with
untried
emotions
something
uplifting
in
the
criminal
action
of
the
girl
so
touched
frederick
that
the
nearness
of
tears
called
a
throb
to
his
throat
without
expostulating
he
wrapped
the
brilliant
covering
about
his
head
the
embroidered
ends
hanging
to
his
waist
frederick
graves
appreciated
for
the
first
time
in
his
short
shielded
life
the
awful
temptations
that
make
these
squatter
people
in
their
cold
and
misery
take
what
did
not
belong
to
them
he
followed
tessibel
with
no
spoken
word
on
and
on
up
past
the
lighted
huts
to
the
gaping
gorge
under
the
trestle
tessibel
knew
that
the
student
could
not
traverse
it
without
her
help
and
she
also
knew
that
to
touch
his
hand
would
be
the
sweetest
of
happiness
to
her
at
any
other
time
her
soul
would
have
recoiled
from
such
temerity
but
the
life
and
welfare
of
daddy
deliverer
were
at
stake
she
halted
abruptly
the
night
was
so
dark
she
could
scarcely
outline
the
student
as
he
stood
near
her
take
hold
of
my
hand
she
ordered
it
air
the
trestle
it
air
a
long
one
and
the
steps
be
far
apart
without
a
demurring
word
frederick
grasped
the
strong
fingers
she
held
out
to
him
a
smile
obscured
by
the
darkness
played
about
the
sensitive
mouth
the
young
body
was
pulsing
with
life
with
intense
gratitude
for
was
not
she
tessibel
skinner
helping
her
friend
with
halting
steps
the
boy
and
girl
commenced
the
most
perilous
part
of
their
journey
tessibel
leading
the
way
the
student
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
long
trestle
are
we
nearly
over
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
the
awful
magnificence
of
the
dark
night
the
rushing
water
tumbling
and
roaring
over
the
rocks
beneath
them
awed
him
into
what
was
almost
timidity
nope
come
on
do
stop
here
urged
tess
a
good
place
at
the
end
of
the
gap
tess
tried
to
draw
her
hand
away
but
it
was
a
feeble
motion
and
she
ceased
as
she
noted
that
frederick
was
still
clinging
to
it
let
me
walk
with
your
hand
in
mine
he
said
simply
with
no
extra
pressure
of
the
fingers
within
his
it
is
dark
for
us
both
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
a
silence
fell
upon
them
brindle
bull
scenting
a
friend
capered
madly
for
a
word
from
tess
but
the
squatter
paid
no
heed
to
her
dog
chum
she
took
her
hand
from
frederick
to
unfasten
the
door
and
light
the
candle
while
they
were
walking
the
tracks
the
woman
in
her
had
tried
to
remember
in
what
condition
she
had
left
the
hut
she
looked
about
hastily
before
lighting
another
candle
she
smuggled
the
frying
pan
from
the
floor
and
picked
up
the
loaf
of
bread
that
had
fallen
behind
the
stove
from
the
table
while
tessibel
lighted
the
fire
frederick
sat
huddled
in
the
wooden
still
wrapped
in
the
crimson
and
watched
the
girl
who
as
she
moved
clumsily
to
and
fro
uttered
no
sound
save
now
and
then
a
characteristic
grunt
instinct
told
the
squatter
that
she
would
choke
the
sensitive
throat
of
the
student
if
she
raised
the
dust
by
sweeping
and
she
refrained
from
using
a
broom
but
frederick
wished
vaguely
that
she
would
gather
up
the
fish
bones
and
crumbs
of
bread
from
her
path
that
they
might
not
crunch
so
audibly
under
her
heavy
boots
an
open
bible
placed
on
daddy
stool
attracted
his
attention
in
his
survey
of
the
room
through
the
flickering
light
he
could
see
the
passages
tessibel
had
marked
he
must
say
something
or
his
brain
would
burst
you
have
a
bible
i
see
his
words
sounded
strained
and
his
voice
foreign
to
his
own
yep
can
you
read
it
i
spells
at
it
tess
replied
in
tones
a
little
surly
where
did
you
get
it
asked
frederick
presently
she
waited
a
moment
before
answering
straightening
up
from
the
oven
where
she
had
placed
the
cold
bacon
left
from
her
breakfast
to
heat
where
did
i
get
what
she
demanded
the
bible
replied
frederick
he
had
asked
about
the
book
in
the
first
place
for
something
to
talk
of
for
the
roaring
of
the
wind
through
the
hut
rafters
distracted
him
he
desired
to
hear
the
squatter
say
something
it
all
seemed
so
much
like
a
dream
that
he
feared
to
awaken
only
to
find
himself
in
the
empty
house
with
the
sophomore
revolver
staring
at
him
i
cribbed
it
from
the
mission
answered
the
girl
pronouncing
her
words
plainly
she
leaned
toward
him
and
finished
abruptly
i
took
it
from
the
place
that
comed
from
she
was
pointing
toward
the
warm
red
bound
about
head
alas
tess
had
needed
a
bible
and
had
stolen
it
he
had
needed
warm
covering
and
had
accepted
it
there
was
no
difference
between
the
minister
son
and
the
squatter
daughter
vicissitude
had
forced
each
into
a
like
position
and
somehow
frederick
lost
his
sense
of
right
and
wrong
for
he
could
not
sit
in
judgment
upon
either
action
never
before
in
all
of
his
short
young
life
had
he
really
needed
anything
for
personal
comfort
but
the
tess
saw
the
struggle
going
on
in
his
mind
she
bent
toward
him
reasoning
i
needed
the
bible
did
i
did
ye
say
that
to
save
daddy
skinner
life
i
had
to
have
it
ye
needed
that
red
rag
what
ye
got
round
yer
head
there
air
only
one
way
in
this
world
she
was
moving
toward
him
inch
by
inch
the
soles
of
the
fisherman
boots
dragging
the
bread
crumbs
and
fish
bones
beneath
them
ye
takes
what
ye
need
to
save
yer
life
or
the
life
of
yer
daddy
folks
mostly
never
steals
what
they
ai
needin
the
message
went
straight
home
to
frederick
he
could
not
combat
such
reasoning
he
knew
well
that
he
would
have
frozen
but
for
the
timely
stealing
of
the
also
he
knew
that
the
bible
was
as
necessary
to
tess
as
the
was
to
him
he
mentally
lashed
himself
into
a
state
of
unrest
why
had
he
not
thought
of
a
bible
and
given
tess
one
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
him
to
have
supplied
her
small
needs
he
was
watching
the
girl
through
the
gloomy
haze
of
the
bacon
smoke
but
spoke
no
more
until
tessibel
ordered
him
to
draw
up
to
the
table
and
eat
have
a
piece
of
bacon
said
she
frederick
held
up
his
plate
and
tess
shoved
a
generous
portion
into
it
she
gave
him
a
tempting
brown
fish
cut
a
slice
of
bread
placing
it
upon
the
side
of
his
tin
plate
and
commenced
to
eat
rapidly
from
her
own
neither
boy
nor
girl
mentioned
sleeping
until
the
hands
of
the
small
nickel
clock
on
the
shelf
in
the
corner
pointed
out
the
hour
of
eleven
then
tessibel
opened
the
subject
without
hesitation
or
embarrassment
it
air
time
fer
ye
to
turn
in
said
she
banking
the
embers
in
the
stove
for
the
night
i
shall
sit
up
replied
frederick
stiffly
there
air
two
beds
commented
tess
in
simple
ignorance
of
all
law
save
necessity
mine
air
under
daddy
see
she
dragged
the
rope
cot
from
under
the
larger
bed
a
cloud
of
dust
rising
white
to
the
shanty
rafters
and
settling
like
a
soft
mist
upon
the
student
i
air
goin
to
sleep
here
explained
tess
with
no
mention
of
the
lately
exposed
dirt
i
only
slep
in
daddy
bed
cause
he
here
ye
go
to
bed
while
i
gets
the
sticks
fer
the
mornin
frederick
placed
his
hand
on
her
arm
almost
timidly
she
was
so
different
from
any
girl
he
had
ever
known
please
allow
me
to
get
the
wood
for
you
two
rows
of
white
teeth
bared
themselves
in
a
frank
smile
i
a
squatter
she
said
and
squatter
women
allers
gets
the
wood
scoot
to
bed
when
tessibel
came
in
from
the
mud
cellar
frederick
lay
with
his
face
toward
the
wall
orn
skinner
soiled
blankets
wrapped
closely
about
his
shoulders
tessibel
placed
the
leather
strap
over
the
staple
in
the
door
and
barred
up
for
the
night
chapter
xxiii
for
almost
an
hour
tessibel
lay
thinking
deeply
her
brain
alive
with
the
past
rapid
happening
of
events
that
the
student
would
ever
sleep
under
her
roof
was
more
than
she
had
dreamed
she
could
hear
him
breathing
evenly
he
was
asleep
with
daddy
blankets
wrapped
tightly
about
his
finely
shaped
head
through
the
dim
light
tessibel
could
follow
the
outline
of
the
great
form
stretched
out
on
the
roped
bed
a
feeling
of
thanksgiving
swept
over
her
she
was
his
protector
she
had
not
thought
of
asking
about
his
crime
of
course
he
was
fleeing
from
the
law
but
he
could
have
done
nothing
that
would
lessen
her
desire
to
aid
him
if
he
had
murdered
then
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
if
he
had
stolen
it
was
the
common
lot
of
all
men
in
need
the
one
thing
to
do
was
to
keep
him
from
the
clutches
of
the
law
she
felt
herself
getting
drowsy
and
soon
the
even
breathing
of
the
squatter
and
the
student
told
that
both
slept
tess
would
never
know
what
time
it
happened
suddenly
her
eyes
flew
open
and
through
the
light
of
a
lantern
she
saw
ben
letts
leering
into
her
face
the
frosty
air
was
blowing
in
gusts
through
the
window
which
the
squatter
ben
had
forced
open
the
horror
of
the
situation
came
slowly
over
her
for
the
instant
she
forgot
the
student
sleeping
in
her
father
bed
and
ben
letts
had
not
noticed
him
ben
began
to
speak
in
low
tones
if
ye
wants
to
live
do
holler
get
up
tess
crawled
out
of
bed
fully
dressed
frederick
slept
on
hearing
no
sound
for
the
cold
room
had
compelled
him
nearly
to
cover
his
head
suddenly
the
presence
of
the
student
came
into
the
girl
mind
but
she
only
threw
a
furtive
glance
at
the
sleeping
youth
what
do
ye
want
she
demanded
vaguely
first
ye
air
to
come
with
me
to
the
brindle
bull
at
kennedy
i

got
somethin
for
him
he
air
dead
in
the
mornin
by
the
hand
of
the
girl
what
loves
him
there
was
unlimitable
sarcasm
in
the
vile
low
face
as
ben
hissed
this
out
and
after
that
asked
tess
edging
toward
the
lower
part
of
daddy
bed
there
she
could
reach
for
the
covering
over
frederick
and
he
would
save
her
the
feeling
of
the
night
before
that
she
was
his
protector
vanished
he
would
never
mind
after
that
growled

her
feet
into
daddy
boots
she
was
strangely
buoyant
and
unafraid
it
was
the
woman

her
rising
to
that
supreme
moment
when
she
should
call
upon
the
man
she
loved
and
he
would
answer

leaning
against
the
wall
his
eyes
having
sought
for
no
other
person
in
the
room
with
the
agility
of
a
hare
tessibel
dashed
around
him
toward
frederick
and
snatched
the
blankets
from
the
bed
the
workings
of
ben
mind
were
so
slow
that
the
form
of
the
student
loomed
up
before
he
realized
that
the
minister
son
was
in
tessibel
cabin
ye
air
here
to
save
me
frederick
cried
tess
the
light
of
the
lantern
sending
a
ray
into
the
upturned
widening
eyes
letts
dropped
his
under
jaw
his
body
relaxing
in
fear
he
was
an
arrant
coward
like
the
most
of
his
downtrodden
race
then
something
shifted
through
his
thick
brain
and
he
smiled
knowingly
so
the
high
and
the
low
air
together
eh
the
dominie
son
and
the
fisherman
brat
the
student
and
the
before
he
had
finished
the
sneering
words
frederick
had
struck
him
full
in
the
face
boyish
dignity
his
father
position
god
everything
was
forgotten
save
tess
he
only
knew
that
she
was
being
maligned
and
that
her
holy
mission
of
rescuing
him
from
the
frost
of
a
night
like
this
was
being
turned
into
evil
by
a
fisherman
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
into
the
man

flabby
body
crashed
frederick
strong
fists
tessibel
stood
looking
on
her
head
bent
forward
alertly
one
arm
was
clasped
about
her
neck
excitement
sparkling
from
the
flushed
face
and
panting
lips
once
the
throat
sound
that
came
when
she
was
excited
rolled
forth
otherwise
she
was
silent
thrashed
from
side
to
side
his
ragged
coat
made
worse
by
the
severe
shaking
frederick
was
administering
ben
letts
groaned
audibly
have
you
had
enough
demanded
the
student
standing
over
the
fisherman
yep
i
a
goin
home
tess
laughed
low
and
wickedly
she
loved
to
see
the
blood
oozing
from
the
mark
in
the
ugly
face
every
drop
matched
those
dragged
from
the
hearts
of
the
brat
mother
who
had
suffered
for
ben
and
of
the
poor
little
miserable
child
himself
struggling
for
life
in
the
longman
shanty
you
better
go
home
ordered
frederick
and
i
want
to
tell
you
something
if
i
ever
hear
you
uttering
a
word
about
my
being
in
this
hut
i
follow
you
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
flog
the
life
out
of

any
of
your
tricks

frederick
shivered
as
the
wind
swept
cold
from
the
frozen
lake
to
his
damp
brow
ben
had
lifted
his
lantern
and
was
swaying
toward
the
door
i
go
hum
said
he
but
i
ai
done
with
ye
some
day
frederick
bounded
forward
like
a
whiplash
but
tess
held
him
back
ben
gave
a
quick
jump
and
was
gone
he
was
worth
any
more
tess
commented
lighting
a
candle
i
know
he
air
the
man
what
killed
my
other
frederick
the
name
slipped
out
with
loving
intonation
then
the
boy
and
the
girl
turned
and
faced
each
other
the
shanty
rocked
in
the
wind
like
the
cradle
of
a
child
the
willow
mourned
its
tale
of
winter
over
the
roof
scraping
the
broken
tin
in
hollow
groans
shrieking
now
and
then
as
a
gust
roared
through
it
for
fully
three
minutes
after
the
going
of
ben
tessibel
stood
looking
at
the
student
he
had
saved
her
from
myra
fate
from
a
hated
thing
that
made
her
teeth
press
hard
together
and
her
eyes
gather
an
expression
of
melting
gratitude
it
were
it
were
but
the
halting
tongue
could
not
finish
untutored
as
she
was
tess
had
read
the
message
in
the
student
eyes
love
teaches
in
one
night
its
dreadful
longing
and
response
its
domineering
power
brought
frederick
graves
nearer
to
tess
in
her
rags
it
made
them
equal
even
as
all
are
equal
in
love
and
in
death
in
an
instant
the
girl
in
the
tatters
was
clasped
close
to
his
heart
the
bright
beautiful
face
lifted
to
his
then
came
the
kiss
the
making
of
which
blended
two
lives
indissolubly
together
the
paleness
of
death
settled
over
the
boy
the
strong
muscles
of
his
shoulders
stood
out
beneath
the
whiteness
of
his
shirt
sleeves
while
his
fingers
pressed
the
head
closer
to
him
his
kiss
deepening
the
crimson
richness
in
the
squatter
face
it
was
the
one
supreme
passionate
moment
of
tessibel
life
the
sound
of
the
whistling
wind
left
her
ears
the
cold
night
blasts
driving
through
the
window
were
as
the
faint
breezes
of
a
summer
evening
the
smoldering
candle
lifted
its
flame
blazing
forth
a
glory
that
surrounded
the
student
with
a
golden
halo
tessibel
had
experienced
her
first
kiss
the
nature
in
her
demanded
that
she
know
the
fullness
of
it
the
pitying
fullness
which
would
bring
to
her
that
which
it
brings
to
all
loving
women
dominated
by
the
passion
born
within
them
the
blood
of
her
race
her
uneducated
primeval
race
rose
and
clamored
for
its
own
in
her
untutored
youth
she
could
have
crushed
the
lad
in
her
wild
longing
for
such
another
kiss
pantingly
she
drew
herself
from
frederick
why
tess
could
never
tell
why
myra
love
for
ben
letts
rushed
over
her
overwhelmingly
the
brat
mother
knew
the
sweetness
of
a
kiss
and
in
it
had
forgotten
the
blasting
winter
winds
on
the
ragged
rocks
where
ben
letts
had
broken
her
arm
frederick
struggled
for
control
a
consciousness
of
the
ignorance
of
the
girl
and
his
own
godly
profession
broke
upon
him
and
he
sank
upon
the
stool
with
a
sob
his
face
in
his
hands
filled
tessibel
soul
with
remorse
delicately
with
the
touch
of
a
lady
born
she
rested
her
hand
upon
the
student
dark
head
the
small
fingers
used
to
the
drudgery
of
a
fisherwoman
life
lifted
the
damp
hair
from
the
high
forehead
her
woman
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
rose
keenly
to
quiet
the
boy
grief
over
his
indiscretion
it
were
good
of
ye
to
remember
that
daddy
were
gone
she
whispered
he
gives
me
kisses
on
the
bill
all
passion
had
left
her
tones
of
course
thought
the
student
she
was
but
a
child
but
a
forlorn
beautiful
child
born
without
without
what
if
he
could
have
known
the
next
moment
he
did
know
with
abandon
complete
and
absolute
the
hot
blood
coursing
madly
from
her
heart
to
her
face
tess
threw
herself
upon
the
shanty
floor
frederick
graves
drew
her
quickly
to
her
feet
tess
tessibel
tess
stand
up
tess
the
last
word
came
out
in
a
shout
he
had
her
in
his
arms
and
she
was
clinging
to
him
as
ivy
clings
for
life
to
an
old
church
tessibel
made
no
effort
to
support
herself
she
was
leaning
limply
against
him
with
closed
eyes
it
air
good
to
forget
sometimes
she
stammered
i
air
a
all
but
the
student
as
on
that
memorable
day
when
daddy
had
been
taken
to
prison
in
auburn
and
she
had
planted
herself
in
his
arms
not
to
be
removed
so
tess
hung
to
frederick
ben
letts
was
forgotten
the
suffering
child
in
the
longman
shanty
whom
she
loved
was
forgotten
even
daddy
skinner
was
forgotten
tessibel
had
found
her
man
and
all
the
experiences
of
her
kind
could
not
help
her
in
her
hour
of
temptation
tessibel
tess
we
ca
forget
stand
up
the
boy
words
spread
through
the
dazed
brain
frederick
dragged
her
arms
from
his
neck
forcing
her
to
the
stool
tessibel
have
you
forgotten
the
christ
your
father
and
me
had
she
forgotten
him
only
him
she
had
remembered
only
his
voice
rang
through
her
like
the
sweetest
music
but
she
was
so
quiet
now
that
the
boy
seated
himself
beside
her
drawing
her
hands
into
his
tess
he
began
intensely
bending
to
look
into
the
flushed
face
tess
look
at
me
slowly
the
brown
eyes
dragged
their
gaze
upward
until
the
boy
and
girl
were
staring
directly
at
each
other
tess
have
you
ever
thought
that
some
time
we
might
be
more
to
each
other
some
time
in
the
future
when
you
have
learned
and
studied
much
wonderingly
she
drew
her
hands
from
his
hiding
them
in
the
folds
of
the
torn
gingham
skirt
i
air
a
squatter
she
got
out
at
last
you
be
high
i
air
low
as
ben
letts
said
but
but
she
faltered
finishing
her
sentence
brokenly
but
i
yer
squatter
for
one
bitter
moment
the
longman
child
with
its
face
flitted
across
her
vision
she
shivered
rose
hastily
and
went
to
the
stove
scattering
the
lids
from
their
openings
before
uttering
another
word
frederick
was
watching
her
critically
you
ought
to
go
to
school
tess
he
said
presently
i
has
to
stay
here
she
replied
beginning
to
stir
the
embers
if
i
left
the
hut
alone
yer
pappy
could
fire
it
and
daddy
and
me
have
a
home
ai
nice
nights
like
this
to
be
without
a
roof
to
cover
ye
frederick
realized
this
had
he
not
been
that
very
night
with
no
place
to
lay
his
head
and
no
kindly
hand
save
hers
to
give
him
something
to
eat
he
flushed
deeply
at
the
mention
of
his
father
and
marveled
that
the
squatter
girl
had
not
spoken
with
any
hard
feeling
in
her
tone
it
was
what
could
be
expected
so
her
voice
implied
if
she
left
the
shanty
alone
the
rightful
owner
could
then
take
back
what
the
law
would
not
allow
if
the
squatters
remained
ye
be
a
goin
to
stay
here
asked
tess
later
by
five
minutes
if
i
may
be
ye
goin
to
tell
me
what
ye
air
hidin
for
frederick
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
he
had
forgotten
to
tell
her
of
course
you
see
i
am
the
freshman
class
president
the
boys
in
the
upper
classes
kidnaped
me
and
kept
me
prisoner
in
an
unused
house
at
the
inlet
i
escaped
last
night
and
you
brought
me
here
the
story
was
so
tame
so
unlike
what
tess
had
expected
to
hear
that
she
drew
a
long
disappointed
breath
there
had
been
a
vague
wish
within
her
heart
that
she
were
going
to
be
of
infinite
benefit
to
him
it
was
such
a
little
thing
to
lose
a
fine
supper
his
life
had
not
been
in
danger
as
she
had
supposed
you
understand
tess
that
it
a
disgrace
to
our
class
not
to
have
the
president
there
frederick
burst
forth
even
if
he
is
kept
away
by
force
i
would
rather
sacrifice
anything
than
have
it
happen
only
i
do
not
want
to
harm
your
good
name
tessibel
tess
stared
at
him
blankly
squatter
brats
do
have
no
names
ye
ca
do
me
any
harm
oh
yes
i
could
insisted
frederick
what
if
that
scoundrel
who
was
here
a
little
while
ago
should
say
that
i
were
here
it
would
harm
us
both
tess
paused
in
her
breakfast
preparations
long
enough
to
say
simply
yer
christ
would
let
him
harm
ye
would
he
the
boy
swept
her
with
an
incredulous
glance
did
she
so
thoroughly
have
faith
in
a
miraculous
interference
in
human
affairs
by
divine
power
the
delicate
face
was
lighted
with
exquisite
coloring
which
came
and
went
in
the
morning
light
like
the
tints
of
a
the
bright
trustful
eyes
were
shining
into
his
every
motion
of
the
lovely
head
and
body
bespeaking
the
blind
faith
in
which
the
squatter
girl
lived
frederick
found
himself
wishing
impetuously
with
all
his
soul
that
he
could
command
a
faith
like
hers
his
own
seemed
so
dead
so
unlike
a
living
faith
that
he
sighed
as
he
turned
toward
her
tessibel
he
said
honestly
you
are
a
better
girl
than
i
am
a
boy
i
am
learning
many
things
from
you
then
looking
up
with
a
smile
after
a
moment
thought
he
finished
no
i
believe
with
you
that
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
harm
one
of
us
if
we
have
faith
in
god
so
i
can
help
ye
if
ye
ai
in
daddy
fix
then
frederick
understood
that
she
would
have
saved
him
even
if
he
had
been
in
danger
of
his
life
yes
he
replied
you
can
aid
me
do
you
know
where
my
fraternity
is
tess
shook
her
head
with
a
troubled
expression
i
can
tell
you

is
i
want
you
to
go
there
and
ask

one
else

or

come
and
take
me
away
and
i
told
you
i
would
almost
rather
die
than
not
be
with
my
class
at
the
banquet
tessibel
spirits
rose
high
she
could
help
him
after
all
how
air
ye
goin
to
get
into
the
place
where
ye
eats
without
took
again
a
flashing
intelligence
leaped
into
the
brown
eyes
during
her
question
i
knows
how
i
can
help
ye
she
lowered
her
voice
and
began
to
describe
the
escape
and
the
final
fulfillment
of
their
plan
frederick
chuckled
when
she
had
finished
that
capital
you
tell
dan
jordan
then
what
you
have
told
me

the
banquet

chapter
xxiv
the
next
morning
at
eight
tessibel
walked
eastward
up
the
long
hill
toward
the
college
the
cranium
fellows
were
yet
asleep
the
whole
house
was
tired
out
from
looking
for
their
captured
president
the
underclassmen
did
not

that

had
escaped
frederick
enemies
keeping
them
in

as
long
as

tessibel
turned
into
the
carriage
drive
toward
the
fraternity
with
a
upon
her
arm
a
man
cleaning
snow
from
the
flight
of

wondered
as
he
crawled
slowly
out
of
bed
what
a
girl
could
want
of
him
at
that
early
hour
he
met
tess
at
the
front
door
and
without
waiting
for

to
speak

said
in
an
undertone

almost
whispered

minister

started
and
looked
at
her
sharply
she
could
mean

placed
his
fingers
on
his
lips

he
asked

around
to

in
a
lower
tone
he
ordered

minutes
at

bottom
of
the
hill
the
last
of
the
sentence
was
breathed
rather
than
spoken
dan
jordan
turned
into
state
street
some
minutes
afterwards
and
he
could
see
the
glistening
red
head
of
the
as
she
swung
her
empty
basket
on
her
arm
and

up
every
white

in
the
wide
smile
i
done
nothin
he
air
done
more
than
that
for
me
the
sweet
face
lighted
by
the
infinite
love
for
the
student
hidden
in
her
hut
spoke
its
own
secret
to
dan
jordan
and
through
his
recently
acquired
knowledge
of
heart
emotions
he
stared
vaguely
at
the
girl
would
frederick
no
no
the
minister
son
was
a
better
lad
than
he
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
a
lump
came
into
his
throat
he
stood
watching
the
figure
of
tess
moving
away
and
regarded
intently
the
great
boots
the
ragged
skirt
the
beautiful
ringlets
and
the
proud
young
head
set
so
well
upon
the
sloping
shoulders
dan
mind
reverted
to
another
girl
no
older
than
the
squatter
and
with
a
sigh
mournful
enough
he
turned
back
to
the
fraternity
tess
walked
down
the
lane
running
as
she
neared
the
foot
of
the
hill
she
wanted
to
impart
to
the
student
what
dan
had
told
her
with
her
fingers
upon
the
hut
latch
she
stopped
short
voices
came
from
inside
she
dropped
her
hand
ben
letts
was
there
or
another
squatter
suddenly
she
opened
the
door
and
stood
in
the
entrance
frederick
was
seated
upon
daddy
stool
professor
young
was
standing
in
his
fur
coat
with
his
back
to
the
stove
the
student
face
had
blanched
to
the
hue
of
death
an
expression
such
as
tess
had
never
seen
in
human
eyes
rested
in
his
he
was
speaking
and
the
girl
ears
caught
the
words
i
would
forfeit
my
life
before
i
would
harm
her
believe
me
two
pairs
of
masculine
eyes
turned
at
the
opening
of
the
door
and
both
men
were
looking
into
the
eager
face
of
tessibel
the
professor
did
not
come
forward
to
meet
her
his
manner
was
stiff
and
formal
for
a
moment
even
the
student
last
words
left
her
mind
and
daddy
skinner
rose
before
her
ye
be
here
to
tell
me
about
daddy
she
asked
you
needed
me
to
come
more
for
yourself
than
to
tell
you
of
your
father
child
said
young
with
accusing
eyes
upon
frederick
a
sullen
expression
flitted
across
tessibel
lips
ye
did
need
to
come
if
yer
a
goin
to
make
the
student
sorry
she
answered
haltingly
ye
has
yer
own
business
to
mind
tess
was
standing
between
them
her
glance
turning
first
to
frederick
then
to
the
professor
she
did
fully
understand
his
words
but
she
knew
that
frederick
had
been
hurt
by
something
the
lawyer
had
said
young
began
to
button
his
coat
he
had
thought
the
girl
worth
saving
and
frederick
had
ever
been
in
his
mind
as
the
perfection
of
young
manhood
his
throat
tightened
he
looked
at
tess
and
thought
of
his
love
for
her
it
was
almost
mastering
him
why
should
he
suffer
over
such
a
girl
who
insulted
him
even
while
he
was
trying
to
help
her
frederick
stood
up
wearily
professor
young
ought
to
realize
the
situation
to
remember
that
some
shelter
was
necessary
for
him
tess
was
stolidly
arranging
the
table
you
do
not
know
how
i
came
to
be
here
said
frederick
briefly
it
is
enough
that
i
see
you
here
replied
young
in
a
temper
tess
slammed
the
oven
door
loudly
she
found
me
on
the
tracks
explained
frederick
i
escaped
from
the
sophomores
and
she
brought
me
here
i
should
have
frozen
to
death
otherwise
and
i
did
not
think
that
it
might
harm
her
it
ai
hurt
me
cried
tessibel
coming
forward
he
air
the
one
what
helped
me
get
my
daddy
skinner
out
of
trouble
he
air
my
friend
the
rage
of
the
girl
when
she
wheeled
impetuously
upon
him
made
the
professor
catch
his
breath
he
had
been
the
one
who
had
done
all
the
work
had
given
her
father
a
new
lease
of
life
he
had
come
now
to
tell
her
about
the
letter
and
to
hear
her
say
that
a
lad
with
no
influence
whatever
had
done
that
which
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
do
to
hear
tess
give
the
credit
which
should
be
his
to
frederick
made
young
pass
his
fingers
through
his
hair
nervously
and
wonder
just
what
the
student
had
done
to
gain
such
praise
his
own
love
for
tess
his
great
desire
pleaded
with
him
to
believe
in
both
the
boy
and
the
girl
tessibel
soulful
expression
went
far
in
giving
back
to
deforest
young
the
hope
that
had
made
his
days
brighter
and
filled
the
future
with
promise
may
i
stay
with
you
to
dinner
miss
tessibel
he
said
shaking
his
shoulders
i
did
not
understand
in
fact
i
had
forgotten
about
the
banquet
i
am
glad
you
helped
graves
make
his
class
dinner

i
stay
frederick
stepped
forward
holding
out
his
hand
thanks
he
said
brokenly
i
shall
never
forget
this
in
you
the
clasping
of
the
two
hands
and
the
smile
on
the
lips
of
the
student
made
tess
broaden
her
own
yep
jerk
off
yer
coat
and
eat
ordered
she
air
ye
heard
about

young

a
moment
what

professor
ejaculated
frederick
do

her
in
suspense
daddy
ai
to
hang
he
ca
her
eyes
turned
to
frederick
ye
said
he
could
the
boy
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
glanced
at
professor
young
again
she
was
giving
the
credit
to
graves
credit
the
lad
so
little
deserved
frederick
felt
this
and
muttered
she
does
understand
yet
what
you
done
professor
i
sorry
they
placed
a
stay
upon
your
father
execution
explained
young
that

give
us
a
chance
to
prove
him
innocent
i
am
positive
that
he
did
kill
the
gamekeeper
i
went
to
the
prison
last
week
ye
seed
him
asked
tess
eagerly
striding
close
to
him
he
felt
the
hot
breath
against
his
face
and
a
feeling
of
longing
coursed
through
his
veins
yes
was
all
he
said
what
did
he
say
about
me
everything
good
you
will
have
him
very
soon
here
with
you
tessibel
the
girl
was
fatigued
with
turbulent
emotions
lonely
and
heartsick
the
shadow
of
the
rope
was
gone
from
daddy
skinner
like
a
relieved
child
she
sank
down
upon
the
floor
and
began
to
whimper
both
men
were
silenced
by
the
swaying
red
head
the
bacon
sputtered
in
the
frying
pan
upon
the
stove
spitting
the
grease
to
the
lids
where
it
burned
away
in
tiny
yellow
flames
then
tess
raised
her
head
what
a
bloke
i
air
to
cry
when
daddy
air
home
we
air
to
eat
now
she
ended
wiping
her
eyes
before
the
meal
was
over
tess
was
on
better
terms
with
young
than
she
had
ever
been
before
he
outlined
to
the
delighted
girl
his
visit
to
the
prison
your
father
says
child
he
related
that
he
took
the
gun
from
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
laid
it
on
the
shore
near
where
he
was
hauling
the
net
he
heard
a
shot
and
ran
forward
and
was
arrested
he
swore
to
me
that
he
did
not
fire
the
gun
and
i
believe
him
the
fatal
step
was
in
his
taking
the
rifle
at
all
because
that
was
disobeying
the
law
ye
air
my
friend
too
tess
said
beamingly
leaning
over
and
taking
the
professor
hand
in
hers
before
he
could
stop
her
she
had
raised
it
to
her
lips
kissed
it
several
times
and
dropping
it
again
calmly
went
on
eating

tedious

his
throat
preparatory
to
speaking
if

he
in
an
eager
undertone

somersault
when

was
in
the
most
harrowing
position
brown

swift
kick

him
one
for

whispered
spuddy
but
swipes
was
on
his
feet
again
ready
to
listen
there
was
a
general
hurrah
when
jordan
in
subdued
tones
had
outlined
the
plan
where

graves

the
word
the
fishermen
of

row
did
not
recognize
the
stranger
who
slouched
along
by
the
side
of
tessibel
the
night
of
the
freshman
banquet
she
was
on
her
way
to
the
city
with
her
fish
one
after
another
women
poked
frowsy
heads
from
the
hut
windows
at
the
barking
of
their
dogs
but
tess
went
steadily
on
not
even
heeding
her
companion
who
hurried
his
footsteps
to
keep
close
to
her
ye
sells
yer
fish
for
a
shillin
a
pound
said
she
after
a
few
minutes
walk
the
man
nodded
once
only
did
he
raise
his
eyes
they
were
passing
a
empty
house
with
a
large
broken
window
just
then
ben
letts
accompanied
by
ezra
longman
met
them
the
red
head
of
the
squatter
girl
rose
a
little
higher
the
lines
growing
deeper
about
the
narrowed
lids
to
the
fisherman
she
deigned
no
nor
had
she
a
thought
of
them
after
they
had
passed

a

her
pappy
out
of

but
stepped
to
the
tracks
with
another
evil
backward
look
at
tess
and
her
squatter
friend
forty
or
fifty
sophomores
loafed
about

and
fro

been
spread
inside
for
several
hundred
guests
and
the
president
chair
was
decorated
with
roses
and
winter
ferns
three
little
freshmen
and
dan
jordan
surrounded
by
many
juniors
went
calmly
in
to
inspect
things
several
underclassmen
stood
disconsolately
inside
be
on
your
guard
whispered
dan
passing
them
the
fifty
sophomores
outside
were
waiting
for
something
to
happen
graves
would
be
produced
how
they
could
not
tell
the
strangeness
of
the
actions
of
frederick
fraternity
brothers
made
the
affair
more
unsolvable
threatening
looks
were
showered
upon
them
as
freshman
after
freshman
guarded
by
juniors
filed
in
dan
jordan
slouched
to
the
door
of
the
his
eyes
falling
mechanically
upon
tessibel
skinner
across
the
street
he
heard
her
arguing
with
the
man
from
the
café
about
her
fish
tessibel
then
crossed
to
the
does

smiled

her
white
teeth

jordan

looked
about
grinning
upon

sophomores

of
them
here

i
want
some
eels
the
sophomores
pretended
not
to
hear
they
were
not
interested
in
fishermen
but
kept
their
eyes
open
for
a
carriage
that
would
dash
in
from
the
main
street
with
the
rescued
president
within
it
sling
them
eels
over
here
commanded
tessibel
beckoning
to
the
slouching
squatter
across
the
way
the
man
with
the
basket
offered
the
contents
to
dan
i

jordan
in
a
loud
voice
how

tess

swipes
innocently
coming
to
dan
side

the
squatter
disappeared
inside
the
building
a
pile
of
fun
they
have
without
their
president
grunted
a
sophomore
tessibel
gathered
her
empty
basket
upon
her
arm
and
amid
the
smiling
looks
of
the
students
who
stood
watching
her
she
walked
away
with
her
head
high
in
the
air
but
dan
jordan
with
a
mighty
yell
triumphantly
taken
up
by
his
classmen
grasped
the
hat
from
the
squatter
head
the
smiling
open
face
of
frederick
graves
was
before
them
the
sophomores
never
quite
puzzled
out
how
the
freshman
president
was
in
his
chair
at
the
banquet
and
directly
in
front
of
him
in
the
place
of
honor
was
a
huge
dish
of
eels
shaking
the
snow
from
her
shoulders
like
a
great
dog
in
a
storm
tess
knocked
softly
on
the
longman
shanty
door
longman
had
gone
to
the
city
with
satisfied
and
myra
with
the
whining
brat
in
her
arms
welcomed
her
one
whole
week
had
passed
since
tess
had
seen
the
student
seven
long
interminable
days
since
and
now
she
had
come
to
ask
myra
longman
some
of
the
mysterious
questions
about
the
kiss
that
frederick
had
given
her
myra
relinquished
the
child
to
her
and
the
little
fellow
sank
to
sleep
under
tessibel
crooning
voice
his
regular
breathing
told
her
that
he
slept
she
placed
him
in
the
box
and
sat
thoughtfully
down
air
ben
letts
been
here
lately
she
asked
after
a
pause
myra
shook
her
head
he
ai
got
no
time
for
such
as
the
brat
and
me
she
replied
bitterly
tess
waited
until
myra
had
ceased
scattering
the
shanty
chairs
in
her
rage
did
he
say
as
how
he
loved
ye
that
night
in
the
storm
on
the
ragged
rocks
she
asked
presently
yep
he
did
say
it
he
did
answered
myra
air
he
air
he
how
to
kiss
the
very
word
slipping
from
her
lips
brought
back
with
a
sudden
joy
that
night
a
week
ago
and
the
kiss
of
the
student
she
could
feel
again
the
warm
strong
lips
pressed
to
hers
the
long
muscular
arms
enfolding
her
myra
scanned
her
face
closely
to
kiss
yep
but
he
ai
never
kissed
the
brat
there
was
wonderful
longing
and
passion
in
her
tones
this
was
a
new
thought
for
tess
the
pappy
should
kiss
his
brat
but
were
they
one
and
the
same
kisses
she
remembered
the
sweetness
of
that
first
caress
daddy
had
given
her
on
the
stone
window
ledge
of
his
cell
it
was
tinged
with
bittersweet
bitter
because
daddy
was
going
away
sweet
because
she
had
desired
it
so
fondly
but
it
had
not
been
like
the
student
kiss
she
was
going
to
ask
myra
longman
to
solve
the
first
great
problem
of
her
life
air
the
kisses
what
ye
had
from
ben
letts
burnin
ones
did
ye
lose
the
thought
of
the
night
and
the
night
things
on
the
ragged
rocks
did
ye
want
again
and
again
more
and
more
kisses
till
they
scorched
yer
face
like
the
bread
oven
in
the
spring
tess
had
risen
to
her
feet
had
whitened
to
the
small
ears
covered
with
the
tawny
hair
myra
had
risen
also
both
girls
were
eying
each
other
with
intentness
tess
started
to
speak
again
coming
forward
a
step
toward
the
other
squatter
did
ye
forget
the
storm
the
wavin
trees
and
all
ben
letts
ye
air
been
to
the
ragged
rocks
moaned
myra
sinking
down
upon
the
floor
in
a
heap
in
a
twinkling
the
meaning
of
myra
words
dawned
upon
tessibel
i
ai
been
there
with
ben
letts
she
replied
suddenly
i
ai
got
no
likin
for
the
brat

kisses
but
ye

to
the
ragged
rocks
insisted
myra
settling
back
with
a
sob
against
the
box
where
the
child
slept
nope
i
ai
but
i
had
a
kiss
and
myra
it
were
like
the
singin
in
the
heavens
what
the
song
tells
about
like
the
feelin
in
here
she
placed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
her
eyes
flashing
golden
when
the
world

filled
with
flowers
and
the
birds

like
that

she
rose
languidly
tucked
the
blanket
closer
about
the
sleeping
head
tessibel
she
broke
forth
hoarsely
for
all
women
folks
there
air
brats
a
cryin
for
their
pa
to
tell
yep
or
nope
and
there
air
men
on
the
ragged
rocks
with
singin
kisses
for
yer
pretty
face
and
tangled
hair
there
air
a
brat
sleepin
till
it
dead
in
the
box
the
tired
young
mother
allowed
her
hungry
gaze
to
fall
upon
the
quiet
infant
tessibel
yer
brat
but
tessibel
bounded
out
of
the
door
over
the
rocks
like
a
deer
she
would
not
lose
the
sweetness
of
the
kiss
in
myra
warning
words
that
penetrating
holy
kiss
she
had
treasured
for
seven
long
days
and
nights
the
torturing
thoughts
that
had
filled
the
mind
of
professor
young
at
finding
frederick
graves
in
the
cabin
of
the
were
new
sensations
to
him
he
loved
tessibel
and
in
her
lay
his
future
happiness
her
stolid
indifference
to
his
endeavors
to
aid
her
through
her
father
had
blasted
his
hopes
somewhat
then
again
he
would
feverishly
reason
that
she
had
been
born
to
overlook
all
save
those
whom
she
desired
and
for
whom
she
fought
it
was
like
her
kind
excuses
for
the
girl
in
the
aid
she
had
given
the
student
ran
willingly
through
his
brain
if
tess
had
seen
the
young
fellow
in
the
storm
it
was
but
like
the
tender
loving
heart
to
aid
him
it
was
no
proof
that
frederick
had
found
a
place
in
her
affections
with
these
thoughts
in
his
mind
he
had
worked
for
several
days
quietly
hoping
that
the
girl
might
seek
him
tess
found
him
waiting
at
the
shanty
door
for
her
one
afternoon
after
returning
from
town
she
smiled
a
welcome
as
she
recognized
her
visitor
it
air
about
daddy
ye
comed
she
said
lifting
the
padlock
from
the
staple
yes
child
i
wanted
to
tell
you
of
some
new
friends

father
has
made
in
ithaca
strong
friends
to

him
friends
echoed
tess
wonderingly
daddy
skinner
had
fishermen
for
his
friends
and
not
people
of
ithacy
come
in
she
added
the
fire
crackled
on
the
hearth
and
tess
sat
down
to
listen
with
open
lips
i
ca
explain
just
how
this
came
about
said
young
but
some
of
the
people
who
were
in
the
the
day
your
father
was
convicted
have
risen
to
befriend
him
professor
young
did
not
add
that
he
himself
had
urged
that
money
should
be
raised
for
a
second
defense
so
last
night
he
went
on
there
was
a
meeting
of
several
prominent
men
and
money
has
been
placed
in
my
hands
for
another
trial
for
your
father
tess
tried
to
understand
the
long
words
and
blinked
knowingly
the
import
of
it
was
plain
daddy
was
coming
back
but
how
soon
when
air
he
comin
home
then
she
demanded
after
another
trial
see
if
you
can
read
this
from
a
long
envelope
the
lawyer
took
a
piece
of
paper
tess
examined
it
carefully
for
some
moments
young
eyeing
her
with
a
sense
of
happiness
he
would
fight
for
this
child
as
man
never
before
fought
for
woman
she
would
love
him
out
of
gratitude
if
for
nothing
else
he
took
the
paper
she
was
holding
out
to
him
ca
read
a
damn
word
ca
read
writin
anyway
tell
me
what
it
says
about

replied
young
mostly
members
of
graves
church
put
in
tess
eagerly
had
the
student
been
praying
for
just
this
she
thought
yes

are
all
desirous
to
see
your
father
home
again
with
his
little
daughter
air
the
minister
givin
money
for
daddy
was
the
anxious
demand
young
shook
his
head
he
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
tell
her
enough
about
the
minister
family
to
make
her
hate
them
all
deforest
young
realized
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
jealous
of
the
student
of
a
tall
dark
lad
of
whom
in
the
past
he
had
taken
no
more
notice
than
of
many
other
students
he
drew
a
long
breath
not
exactly
the
minister
said
he
flushing
with
shame
here
let
me
read
the
names
to
you
william
hopkins

the
toggery
shop

the
druggist
bates
he

not
put
down
his
name
on
the
list
but
he
gave
fifty
dollars
tessibel
listened
to
the
explanations
as
young
read
on
making
it
all
plain
to
her
as
he
proceeded
she
was
leaning
far
over
toward
him
her
chin
resting
on
her
open
palm
they
be
dum
good
blokes
to
give
their
money
to
a
squatter
they
the
professor
started
perceptibly
she
did
not
understand
that
all
had
been
done
under
his
supervision
he
had
tried
to
impress
upon
her
his
great
desire
to
help
her
but
no
words
of
praise
fell
from
her
lips
for
him
he
would
have
willingly
given
worlds
had
she
said
that
he
was
a
dum
good
bloke
they
are
all
sorry
for
you
and
your
father
he
ended
lamely
it
was
the
student
graves
what
brought
daddy
the
money
she
burst
out
with
a
vivid
blush
no
the
student
graves

nothing
to
do
with
it
was
the
grim
reply
he
prayin
since
daddy
went
away
that
air
somethin
tess
said
stubbornly
professor
young
rose
then
seated
himself
again
he
had
come
for
something
else
something
that
meant
work
and
satisfaction
for
him
now
that
your
father
is
sure
to
be
saved
will
you
leave
this
hut
he
asked
peremptorily

but
it
not
fit
for

to
be

blankets
of
the
bed

it
every
day
if

the
curls
from

shoulders
as
she
ended
emphatically
i

a
goin
to
bring
daddy
home
through
this
here
book
the
student
says
again
the
terrible
jealousy
of
the
handsome
student
flashed
alive
in
the
professor
tess
had
opened
the
bible
to
a
chapter
she
had
never
read
before
and
straightway
in
the
morning
she
spelled
the
chief
priests
aw
that
ai
no
good
wait
till

find
about

then
suddenly
she
threw
the
bible
down

in

place
where
i
just

about

geezers
the
priests
the
lawyer
stood
up
a
pain
seized
him
he
would
save
this
ignorant
girl
in
spite
of
herself
marry
her
in
spite
of
frederick
graves
it
would
be
as
difficult
as
scaling
the
icy
mountains
but
he
would
force
her
to
love
him
more
than
the
whole
world
you
understand
he
said
shortly
that
these
good
people
have
given
money
toward
helping
your
father
come
home
it
will
be
some
time
before
the
trial

come
up
but
when

i
will

him
back
to
you
the
assurance
in
his
tones
brought
tess
to
his
side

said
abruptly
and
the
squatters
says
as
how

mist
had
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
she
slipped
her
fingers
into
professor
young
she
laid
her
lips
upon
his
hand
covering
it
with
tears
and
kisses
opening
the
shanty
doors
she
said
i
likes

i

tracks

my
horse
at
the
top
of
the
hill
replied
young
confusedly
the
sensation
from
the
moist
lips
upon
his
flesh
prompted
him
for
one
brief
moment
to
take
the
girl
to
him
he
was
filled
with
a
strange
desire
to
force
this
rude
shanty
maid
from
her
surroundings
and
place
her
in
another
life
with
him
chapter
xxvi
that
night
as
tessibel
slept
and
dreamed
of
frederick
another
girl
waited
for
her
lover
teola
graves
watched
for
the
approach
of
dan
jordan
with
strange
emotions
when
he
was
with
her
his
great
strength
and
constant
assurances
that
everything
would
go
rightly
with
them
gave
the
girl
courage
and
confidence
but
in
the
when
youthful
sleep
refused
to
come
she
was
afraid
afraid
she
stood
just
outside
the
door
upon
the
veranda
shrinking
from
the
raw
winter
wind
relievedly
she
noticed
dan
tall
form
when
he
swung
around
the
corner
you
should
not
stand
in
the
night
wind
dear
dan
chided
gently
kissing
her
there
now
i
have
come
for
a
good
chat
teola
do
not
look
so
sad
please
the
little
in
the
rectory
was
partially
dark
when
they
seated
themselves
on
the
divan
i
am
so
unhappy
dan
so
different
from
what
i
used
to
be
then
life
was
sweet
and
i
was
glad
to
live
but
you
do
want
to
be
dead

of
it
teola
when

finished
college
i
shall
be
of
age
we
will
go
away
from
ithaca
and
no

but
we
shall
know
dan
if
i
had
only
been
a
good
girl
dan
was
visibly
moved
let
make
a
bargain
said
he
suddenly
we
wo
talk
of
anything
but
the
pleasantest
of
things
i
have
something
funny
to
tell
you
i
have
something
to
tell
you
too
breathed
teola

pleasant
demanded
the
boy
bending
and
forcing
the
lowered
eyes
to
his
teola
shook
her
head
then
we
will
leave
it
until
he
exclaimed
i
tell
you
my
news
shorts
spuddy
and
swipes
are
in
disgrace
at
the
fraternity
if
shorts
would
keep
away
from
those
other
two
fellows
he
might
get
through
college
it
was
really
their
fault
frederick
was
stolen
what
have
they
done
now
asked
teola
listlessly
she
had
little
interest
in
the
boys
of
the
society
for
nestled
close
to
her
heart
was
a
secret
she
could
not
forget
she
had
a
realization
that
something
unusual
had
fallen
upon
her
of
which
she
was
afraid
well
you
see
explained
dan
there
is
a
comic
opera
playing
here
this
afternoon
swipes
shorts
and
spuddy
took
some
of
the
chorus
girls
to
the
house
when
the
other
fellows
were
away
they
might
have
known
the
officers
would
have
found
it
out
sure
enough
they
did
the
little
rascals
were
all
drunk
on
champagne
and
the
girls
had
to
be
sent
to
their
hotels
in
carriages
the
kids
received
a
great
beating
let
me
tell
you
they
are
all
in
bed
in
the
cupola
prison
rooms
trying
to
get
over
big
heads
teola
wanted
to
smile
to
be
happy
but
the
smiles
refused
to
come
dan
turned
the
subject
have
they
gathered
a
deal
of
money
for
skinner
teola
nodded
and
presently
responded
yes
and
father
thinks
it
is
so
strange
hall
and
professor
young
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
plan
they
think
the
skinner
girl
is
a
great
marvel
i
too
think
she
is
beautiful
and
so
does
frederick
she
has
a
lot
of
courage
mused
dan
thinking
of
the
girl
who
had
rescued
the
class
president
from
the
hands
of
his
enemies
teola
knew
nothing
of
this
episode
for
frederick
had
asked
him
to
be
silent
upon
it
your
father
does
not
wish
the
man
liberated
the
question
in
voice
brought
a
flush
to
teola
pale
face
no
he
thinks
the
tribe
is
a
menace
to
the
town
and
he
is
sure
the
man
is
guilty
they
do
tell
dreadful
things
of
them
and
i
ca
help
but
believe
some
of
the
tales
although
i
feel
sorry
for
the
girl
but
her
coming
to
the
toffy
pull
that
night
made
a
great
deal
of
trouble
for
brother
and
me
so
i
supposed
but
i
love
you
teola
for
the
manner
in
which
you
treated
her
teola
straightened
herself
from
her
lover
arms
and
was
about
to
speak
she
would
tell
him
then
tell
him
her
secret
tell
all
the
fears
that
weighed
upon
her
heart
as
if
they
were
loaded
with
lead
he
would
comfort
and
tell
her
not
to
worry
cheer
her
until
she
could
smile
again
and
be
happy
shorts
swipes
and
spuddy
had
broken
the
laws
of
the
fraternity
rather
than
suffer
the
disgrace
of
leaving
it
they
had
elected
a
severe
punishment
i
rather
be
cut
to
pieces
boys
swipes
hiccoughed
turning
upon
the
grave
seniors
than
let
my
mother
know
what
a
beast
i
been
go
ahead
and
lick
afterward
the
three
little
freshmen
slunk
to
the
rooms
in
the
top
of
the
society
house
which
were
kept
ready
for
young
men
whom
the
officers
reprimanded
they
had
been
ordered
to
bed
for
three
days
and
were
thankful
that
the
punishment
had
been
no
worse
than
it
was
swipes
demanded
a
cigarette
go
to
sleep
ordered
shorts
it
was
all
your
fault
in
the
beginning
and
you
drunk
no
such
thing
i
could
haul
a
whole
bunch
of
girls
up
here
alone
could
i
if
i
drunk
could
i
now
i
wish
there
was
any
such
a
being
in
the
world
as
a
woman
they
bring
heaps
of
trouble
on
us
poor
men
saying
this
swipes
tumbled
into
bed
and
sank
into
a
stupor
the
cry
of
fire
rang
out
upon
the
night
air
startling
dan
jordan
and
teola
graves
the
volunteer
fire
companies
were
gathering
from
all
parts
of
the
town
and
dan
stepped
on
to
the
rectory
veranda
as
a
rolled
by
in
an
instant
he
was
back
in
the
sweetheart
sweetheart
said
he
with
a
strangling
kiss
upon
pale
lips

fraternity
house

he
pressed
her
to
him
again

through
the
door
and
was
gone
dan
dan
exclaimed
teola
dan

back
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
so
afraid

afraid
teola
stood
watching
the
yellow
flames
kiss
the
sky
the
whole
campus
gleamed
under
the
lurid
glare
of
the
fraternity
fire
the
light
in
the
heavens
told
her
that
it
was
no
ordinary
conflagration
until
the
day
of
her
death
she
would
not
forget
that
night
she
was
longing
to
hear
one
word
from
dan
or
frederick
her
world
seemed
charged
with
hideous
forces
hitherto
unfelt
teola
sickened
and
waited
if
dan
would
only
come
back
the
very
moment
after
he
had
fallen
asleep
it
seemed
to
swipes
shorts
was
pulling
him
out
of
bed
and
the
room
was
full
of
smoke
spuddy
was
sleeping
in
the
next
chamber
and
the
first
sound
came
to
him
in
a
dream
he
thought
he
heard
a
roar
of
thunder
and
rain
descending
upon
the
roof
never
mind
he
was
safe
in
bed
and
had
just
escaped
expulsion
from
his
fraternity
as
he
rubbed
his
aching
head
a
dazed
resolution
took
form
in
his
brain
he
would
never
get
drunk
again
never
never
then
the
fumes
of
the
wine
brought
visions
of
dresses
of
pretty
faces
and
tender
loving
arms
such
as
his
father
had
told
him
to
beware
of
he
would
toss
such
joys
from
him
if
it
brought
him
spuddy
groaned
turned
in
bed
and
tried
to
wake
up
but
to
wake
up
was
to
realize
his
disgrace
he
groaned
again
a
sharp
pain
ripping
through
his
head
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
he
was
dreaming
of
course
the
wine
floated
fantastic
visions
again
through
his
misty
brain
relieving
it
of
the
effort
of
thinking
then
voice
rang
in
his
ear
for
the
love
of
god
spud
get
up
the
house
is
on
fire
and
boxed
in
this
cupola
like
rats
in
a
trap
spuddy
sprang
out
of
bed
the
thunder
he
had
dreamed
of
was
the
roar
of
the
fire
in
the
walls
of
the
great
house
the
rain
descending
on
the
roof
was
the
water
being
thrown
from
the
long
a
strong
stream
of
water
suddenly
broke
the
window
driving
swipes
against
the
wall
he
whimpered
drunkenly
plagued
fire
the
house
had
to
burn
down
on
a
night
like
this
screams
and
cries
from
the
crazed
mob
below
came
up
to
the
boys
through
the
broken
pane
the
water
ceased
its
flow
and
shorts
the
most
sober
of
the
three
crept
to
the
opening
spuddy
had
crawled
back
to
bed
far
beneath
him
shorts
could
see
his
fraternity
brothers
running
wildly
to
and
fro
frantically
waving
their
arms
to
him
he
could
hear
orders
given
in
loud
tones
and
recognized
the
voices
of
frederick
graves
and
dan
jordan
it
all
flashed
upon
shorts
in
a
moment
how
greatly
he
and
his
chums
were
to
blame
for
the
disaster
for
the
fire
must
have
started
in
the
he
thrust
his
head
through
the
lurid
gleam
to
attract
attention
and
saw
the
men
and
boys
in
the
yard
bringing
ladders
to
rescue
them
now
they
were
splicing
them
together
to
make
it
possible
to
reach
the
great
height
shorts
made
quick
resolves
if
he
lived
he
turned
with
a
groan
and
dragged
spuddy
from
the
bed
to
the
open
window
stay
there
and
be
ready
if
you
do
want
to
die
he
commanded
curtly
shorts
saw
the
ladder
rear
upward
and
a
form
dart
from
the
shadows
dan
jordan
was
coming
hand
over
hand
toward
him
the
long
ladder
creaking
under
his
weight
jordan
face
appeared
at
the
opening
come
out
here
he
commanded
shorts
shorts
pushed
spuddy
forward
take
him
first
captain
he
said
with
a
twist
in
his
voice
drunk
spuddy
hung
limp
on
the
for
an
instant
and
was
then
gathered
into
dan
long
arms
shorts
bleared
eyes
saw
the
little
chap
handed
safely
to
the
earth
and
the
ladder
again
creaked
under
the
upward
steps
of
the
big
freshman
shorts
pushed
swipes
toward
the
window
as
dan
called
his
name
now
he
was
alone
and
he
leaned
as
far
out
as
he
could
god
god
he
groaned
the
captain
face
is
scorched
brown
god
dear
god
bless
him
the
crowds
below
were
sending
up
cheer
after
cheer
myriads
of
sparks
shot
high
into
the
air
dying
in
the
snow
as
they
fell
streams
of
water
poured
into
the
flaming
windows
jordan
was
coming
up
again
come
out
shorts
he
heard
dan
say
and
he
clambered
over
the
sill
slip
into
my
arms
old
man
the
deep
voice
persuaded
come
now
let
go
there
hang
limper
you
heavier
than
the
others
he
felt
dan
take
a
downward
step
and
his
head
whirled
around
and
around
they
passed
window
after
window
shorts
being
carefully
held
under
dan
arm
flames
licked
at
them
greedily
touching
and
shriveling
their
flesh
smoke
choked
their
nostrils
cruelly
shorts
could
feel
the
trembling
of
dan
body
as
his
burned
fingers
grasped
each
rung
of
the
ladder
to
his
mind
the
figures
below
looked
like
goblins
dancing
in
the
light
suddenly
midway
to
the
ground
the
ladder
creaked
and
groaned
hideously
jordan
halted
the
ladder
is
bending
shorts
he
breathed
hoarsely
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
shouted
catch
him
little
brown
shot
into
the
air
like
a
rubber
ball
a
crashing
sound
broke
over
the
silent
gaping
throng
below
then
a
giant
form
turned
twice
in
the
air
shooting
downward
like
a
stone
from
a
sling
the
crowd
parted
and
dan
jordan
struck
the
frozen
ground
his
fraternity
brothers
lifted
up
the
unconscious
boy
and
the
great
roof
above
with
a
sickening
din
sank
into
the
fire
the
bitter
frost
hardened
the
streams
of
water
pouring
from
holes
in
the
burning
house
into
ropes
of
ice
toward
morning
the
fire
died
leaving
the
huge
frame
like
an
palace
looming
darkly
against
the
college
hill
in
another
fraternity
house
shorts
was
in
bed
face
and
hands
swathed
in
bandages
swipes
and
spuddy
and
pale
stood
by

door
waiting

would
come
and
tell

as
strong
as

if

me
out
into
that
snow
pile
i
would

been
crushed
under
him
i
never

that
in

finished
with
a
shudder

but
he
looked
dead
when
they
picked
him
up

swipes
in
despair
i
done
for

he
stepped
aside
and

deliberately
closed
the
door
then
he
sat
down
dazedly
he
gone

the
captain

the
words

in
a
stammer
through
pressed
lips
i
wish
it

been
i
muttered
swipes
brokenly
when
they
were
alone
again
it
was
all
my
fault
he
burst
into
a
wild
sobbing
i
give
my
very
life
to
have
heard
the
captain
say
he
had
forgiven
me
i
was
more
to
blame
than

were
replied
spuddy
my
mother
god
look
at
that
sun
bright
rays
slanted
golden
through
the
window
upon
the
three
woful
little
freshmen
who
had
ruined
the
cranium
society
chapter
xxvii
one
day
in
the
following
july
tessibel
was
going
to
longman
hut
with
a
list
of
bible
words
she
did
not
understand
she
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
listened
to
a
curious
sobbing
sound
she
thought
issued
from
beyond
the
gorge
then
thinking
herself
mistaken
she
ran
nimbly
on
avoiding
the
long
thorns
that
lay
in
her
path
the
noise
came
more
distinctly
through
the
clear
air
making
the
squatter
girl
lift
her
head
and
pause
again
there
was
no
mistake
this
time
it
ai
no
pup
she
said
aloud
a
pup
do
snivel
like
that
raising
the
red
head
she
tore
long
threads
of
hair
loose
from
the
briars
and
drawing
the
masses
of
curls
about
her
shoulders
broke
into
the
opening
of
the
forest
some
one
was
crying
and
any
sign
of
suffering
brought
an
immediate
response
from
tess
it
might
be
myra
or
it
might
be
some
little
lost
child
spurred
on
by
sympathy
she
bounded
over
a
bed
of
dead
chestnut
burrs
waded
through
the
water
to
the
other
side
of
the
creek
and
struggled
up
the
rocks
teola
graves
crouched
in
an
attitude
of
suffering
and
despair
was
seated
on
the
gnarled
root
of
a
huge
tree
tessibel
watched
her
for
an
instant
here
was
a
holy
personage
to
the
squatter
touched
with
the
finger
of
the
mysterious
god
the
student
worshiped
and
was
she
not
the
sister
of
frederick
and
had
not
teola
given
her
coffee
from
her
own
cup
that
winter
night
tessibel
had
not
spoken
to
the
daughter
since
her
father
had
been
taken
away
to
auburn
and
some
of
the
intensity
tess
had
felt
upon
that
one
great
day
of
her
life
came
back
to
her
as
she
stood
hesitant
watching
the
student
sister
perhaps
the
girl
was
weeping
for
some
pleasure
denied
her
perhaps
for
a
jewel
to
wear
about
her
neck
she
went
forward
impulsively
and
laid
her
hand
upon
the
rounded
shoulder
what
be
ye
blattin
over
she
stammered
with
a
tinge
of
awe
in
her
voice
teola
struggled
to
her
feet
suppressing
her
grief
the
question
stopped
the
flow
of
tears
and
the
two
girls
so
differently
situated
the
one
the
daughter
of
an
eminent
minister
and
the
other
a
squatter
wonderingly
eyed
each
other
i
thought
i
was
alone
was
teola
answer
so
ye
was
replied
tess
i
heard
ye
cryin
from
the
lower
ledge
of
the
rocks
what
air
the
matter
infinite
pity
and
tenderness
in
the
coarse
words
spoken
in
a
sweet
persuasive
voice
brought
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
from
teola
i
i
ill
ye
be
all
right
much
air
it
it
is
very
much
to
me
whispered
teola
i
so
lonely
and
so
afraid
tessibel
sat
silently
down
beside
the
other
girl
twining
one
arm
about
the
twisted
root
of
the
tree
she
was
used
to
sorrow
used
to
watching
the
agony
of
human
souls
without
hope
a
bird
in
the
top
of
the
tree
above
them
sent
a
plaintive
note
into
the
hot
air
another
answered
from
the
forest
and
tessibel
raised
her
head
and
saw
a
scarlet
bird
take
wing
and
disappear
into
the
branches
of
the
wood
trees
she
waited
for
teola
to
speak
but
at
last
seeing
there
was
no
cessation
of
tears
she
leaned
over
and
touched
her
be
ye
lonely
for
yer
ma
she
murmured
teola
shook
her
head
in
the
negative
then
for
yer
pa
no
ah
tess
had
forgotten
had
she
not
seen
frederick
go
away
weeks
before
in
a
boat
filled
with
pots
and
kettles
and
food
for
a
camping
expedition
had
he
not
smiled
at
her
brightly
as
she
passed
him
on
her
way
to
the
fish
line
she
could
remember
the
tense
feeling
in
her
throat
and
felt
again
the
hot
blood
rushing
madly
into
her
face
of
course
the
girl
was
weeping
for
her
brother
then
air
ye
blattin
for
the
student
she
could
scarcely
utter
the
last
word
scarcely
let
teola
hear
her
voice
use
that
beloved
name
yes
i
was
crying
for
him
replied
teola
he
is
dead
you
know
for
one
instant
tess
thought
the
world
had
lost
its
sun
her
face
creased
into
lines
which
tightened
under
the
tanned
skin
how
could
frederick
have
died
and
she
not
have
known
she
rose
unsteadily
to
her
feet
uttering
one
grunt
significant
of
her
suffering
were
he
drowned
she
asked
in
a
voice
so
pained
that
teola
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
her
she
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
whitened
lips
nor
of
the
tense
of
the
long
eyes
no
she
replied
slowly
he
was
killed
in
the
fire
on
the
hill
last
winter
the
muscles
relaxed
in
the
squatter
face
her
legs
refused
to
bear
the
slender
body
and
tessibel
dropped
again
at
teola
side
the
kiss
she
had
cherished
burned
hot
upon
her
lips
her
student
lived
the
minister
daughter
cried
for
the
other
one
for
him
who
had
called
her
miss
skinner
and
who
afterward
helped
her
smuggle
frederick
into
the
why
he
air
been
dead
a
long
time
ai
he
yes
six
months
and
ye
air
him
yet
yes
but
he
air
dead
philosophized
tess
he
ai
with
no
other
girl
teola
shivered
violently
oh
i
know
that
i
know
that
but
i
i
need
him
i
want
him
so
but
he
air
dead
said
tess
again
steadily
for
many
minutes
neither
spoke
for
teola
new
burst
of
agony
settled
a
solemnity
upon
tess
which
she
could
not
throw
off
forgetting
her
squatter
position
she
slipped
her
hand
between
the
white
fingers
of
the
weeper
teola
did
not
care
if
the
girl
were
filled
with
black
soot
did
not
care
if
the
squatter
were
covered
with
a
dirty
ragged
dress
or
if
her
bare
feet
were
calloused
from
the
rocks
tess
was
a
human
being
who
sympathized
with
her
and
sympathy
was
as
necessary
to
teola
soul
at
that
moment
as
breath
was
to
her
body
in
the
spasmodic
whitening
of
the
other
girl
face
tess
realized
a
desperate
heart
agony
illustration
then
ye
air
comin
home
with
me
to
the
shanty

she
said
at
last
an
enlightened
expression
widening
her
lids
a
woman
kind
of
sick
ai
it
eh
yes
answered
teola
flushing
deeply
yes
then
ye
air
home
with
me
to
the
shanty
tess
muttered
this
in
a
sly
voice
almost
in
a
whisper
teola
raised
her
glance
and
read
in
the
eyes
bent
upon
her
that
her
whole
secret
was
known
tessibel
skinner
her
father
foe
the
daughter
of
a
murderer
was
helping
her
to
her
feet
i
too
sick
to
walk
she
wept
in
a
barely
audible
voice
i
tried
to
throw
myself
from
the
rocks
over
there
but
the
water
was
so
silent
blue
and
terrible
that
i
could
ye
be
comin
with
me
insisted
tess
stolidly
she
was
urging
her
forward
holding

months

been
alone
all
summer
with
rebecca
our
maid
and
frederick
my
brother
her
lips
closed
over
a
moan
of
pain
and
she
did
not
continue
her
sentence
through
the
forest
over
the
gullies
and
down
toward
the
skinner
hut
the
two
girls
went
slowly
teola
whimpering
in
her
agony
of
soul
and
tess
carrying
her
when
she
could
not
walk
only
once
did
tessibel
stop

a
minute

clean
through

come
along
what

care
if

teola
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
when
they
crept
under
the
willow
tree
the
hut
was
in
its
usual
dirty
condition
the
bible
in
the
accustomed
place
on
the
stool
the
suffering
girl
did
not
notice
that
the
table
was
littered
with
the
remains
of
the
dinner
and
tess
put
her
in
bed
and
said
with
a
compelling
forceful
glance

quickly
this
time
the
briars
and
thorns
pierced
the
squatter
bare
feet
without
avail

was
rushing
away
upon
an
errand
of
love
was
she
not
perhaps
saving
the
sister
of
the
student
from
death
keeping
from
him
a
knowledge
that

rend
his
heart
since
that
night
when

the
old
woman
crawling
out

never

come
along
it
was
a
strange
couple
forging
the
gorges
and
gullies
pushing
aside
the
brambles
to
the
lane
almost
opposite
minister
graves
home
in
the
summer
quietude
the
squatter
girl
could
mark
the
long
chairs
on
the
dominie
front
porch
and
the
hammock
sagging
from
the
hooks
in
the
corner
no
one
saw
the
witch
and
tessibel
enter
the
hut
no
one
heard
the
girl
slip
the
night
lock
into
its
fastening
teola
frightened
and
miserable
raised
her
head
and
looked
once
at
mother
moll
then
dropped
it
again
chapter
xxviii
dusk
had
fallen
over
the
lake
closing
the
shanty
within
the
shadows
of
the
weeping
willows
mother
moll
had
departed
before
sunset
tessibel
had
four
candles
streaming
their
twinkling
light
upon
the
bare
floor
of
the
hut
and
was
busying
herself
at
the
stove
a
voice
from
the
bed
faintly
whispered
did
you
tell
rebecca
what
i
told
you
to
tell
me
again
what
you
said
to
her
i
telled
that
ye
was
to
stay
with
a
girl
below
the
ragged
rocks
and
she
did
give
a
dum
she
air
only
a
workin
girl
she
yer
own
flesh
and
blood
and
the
baby
tessibel

this
bread

to
go
home
ye
know
but
my
baby
tess
what
shall
i
do
about
my
baby
the
nervous
whining
in
teola
voice
brought
tess
over
to
her
the
squatter
forced
the
soiled
blanket
over
the
young
shoulders
if
ye
sleeps
i
tells
ye
in
the
mornin
about
the
brat
sleep
now
for
more
than
an
hour
tessibel
sat
with
teola
graves
baby
clasped
tightly
in
her
arms
moving
back
and
forth
silently
in
the
wooden
rocker
a
broken
board
squeaked
now
and
then
under
the
girl
weight
but
she
slipped
the
chair
into
other
positions
and
rocked
on
she
marveled
at
the
child
born
but
that
afternoon
the
eyes
were
large
and
grey
locks
of
damp
hair
fell
over
a
wrinkled
broad
brow
giving
the
infant
the
expression
of
an
old
old
man
in
the
light
tess
could
mark
every
feature
she
had
never
seen
a
babe
so
small
and
so
she
ran
her
fingers
over
the
right
cheek
tenderly
rubbing
down
a
livid
mark
that
extended
from
the
dark
hair
to
the
upper
part
of
the
breast
it
was
the
of
fire
red
and
gleaming
crimson
as
the
brightest
blood
and
it
had
been
because
of
this
mark
that
tess
had
refused
the
young
mother
request
to
see
her
child
perhaps
in
the
morning
it
would
be
gone
if
not
teola
would
be
stronger
and
better
able
to
bear
the
shock
after
wrapping
the
infant
closely
in
a
warm
cloth
tess
took
it
in
her
arms
and
laid
herself
down
beside
teola
and
the
trio
slept
as
all
youth
sleeps
until
the
morning
sun
had
been
shining
long
in
the
window
be
ye
better
now
asked
tess
trying
to
stand
teola
on
her
feet
i
am
dreadfully
ill
yet
was
the
whispered
answer
but
i
want
to
see
my
baby
and
what
shall
i
do
with
him
oh
what
shall
i
do

replied
the
squatter
and
he
stays
here
with
me
ye
hear

take
him
to
yer
pa
house
and
the
hut

good
enough
for
him
to
live

was
good
enough
for
him
to
be
borned
in
you
mean
tessibel
that
you
will
care
for
my
baby
until
i
can
arrange
something
for
him
so
that

father
and
mother

not

student

in
tess

student
nothin
about
the
little
kid
of
course
you
wo
answered
teola
weakly
i
trust
you
tessibel
there
was
a
deep
questioning
in
the
squatter
girl
eyes
as
they
rested
upon
the
quiet
bundle
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
how
could
a
mother
leave
her
child
in
the
care
of
a
stranger
leave
him
in
a
squatter
hut
where
the
rats
scurried
hungrily
about
the
floor
and
the
bats
fluttered
among
the
ceiling
rafters
do
look
like
that
tessibel
teola
burst
in
you
understand
you
that
i
ca
tell
them
that
i
ca
take
him
home
my
brother
loves
me
better
than
any
other
person
in
the
world
and
i
love
him
as
much
as
he
does
me
the
blood
suffused
the
drawn
face
to
the
hair
line
and
i
want
to
see
my
baby
before
i
go
she
pleaded
tess
shook
her
shoulders
and
hesitated
awkwardly
he
air
to
sleep
and
ye
ai
no
business
him
up
nuther
suddenly
a
dread
flashed
into
teola
mind
tessibel
he
is
there
is
something
the
matter
with
him
she
was
fully
dressed
tremblingly
holding
the
post
of
the
bed
for
support
there
is
something
the
matter
with
him
she
gasped
again
nothin
that
air
him
soothed
tess
he
air
marked
with
the
fire
what
killed
his
pa
that
air
all
see
much
she
lifted
the
babe
from
the
bed
and
held
him
up
the
covering
dropped
from
the
shoulder
exposing
the
brilliant
scar
not
much
moaned
teola
not
much
poor
little
baby
dan
the
mark
gleamed
out
on
the
wizened
old
face
the
deep
veins
in
the
thin
skin
showing
darkly
to
tess
it
looked
more
horrible
than
in
the
night
before
but
she
had
to
reassure
the
mother
the
little
mother
who
before
that
year
had
never
known
one
twinge
of
agony
it
sure
goes
away
sometime
said
tess
teola
took
the
infant
in
her
arms
for
a
moment
only
moving
the
child
caused
the
large
grey
eyes
to
open
the
mouth
widening
into
a
yawn
take
him
tess
mourned
the
mother
oh
i
i
want
to
die
dear
god
dear
good
god
dan
dan
i
want
to
come
to
you
in
the
presence
of
such
grief
tessibel
was
silent
she
covered
the
infant
again
and
for
some
minutes
she
sat
by
the
bed
with
her
fingers
tightly
pressed
in
those
of
teola
it
was
a
tragedy
with
which
tess
could
not
cope
so
she
remained
there
until
teola
cried
herself
into
a
quietude
that
left
an
expression
of
wonder
knowledge
and
sorrow
as
tess
led
her
up
the
hill
to
the
minister
cottage
she
saw
that
tears
would
come
no
more
that
the
mother
would
never
know
the
emotions
of
a
girl
again
teola
resembled
the
squatter
myra
with
her
face
she
falled
from
the
rocks
glibly
lied
tess
as
rebecca
placed
the
pale
girl
in
a
chair
better
put
her
in
bed
she
has
a
bad
ankle
she
could
walk
much
the
frightened
maid
quickly
responded
to
the
advice
of
the
squatter
she
found
me
pleaded
teola
and
you
will
let
her
come
once
in
a
while
to
see
me
rebecca
hesitated
your
mother
and
father
they
are
not
here
yet
and
i
am
so
lonely
and
let
tessibel
come
once
in
a
while
i
have
my
doubts
said
the
maid
and
she
followed
tess
down
the
long
stairs
just
to
see
that
the
did
not
steal
anything
let
that
dirty
squatter
come
into
a
minister
home
no
not
again
vowed
rebecca
inwardly
it
was
only
the
girl
duty
to
save
a
human
being
from
a
fall
over
the
rocks
tess
turned
and
faced
the
woman
when
they
were
alone
i
air
again
she
said
slyly
and
i
ai
one
what
tells
that
ye
slides
from
the
house
every
night
to
the
lake
with
deacon
coachman
i
ai
i
has
a
tongue
in
my
head
i
has
but
it
no
coachman
and
yerself
tess
saw
instantly
that
her
point
was
gained
that
anyone
had
seen
her
meet
the
man
by
the
light
of
the
summer
moon
had
never
entered
rebecca
head
for
one
moment
and
i
do
steal
from
the
minister
house
nuther
assured
tess
with
a
smile
i
brings
ye
some
berries
and
gives
them
to
ye
and
ye
can
keep
the
dominie
money
for
a
rag
of
a
ribbon
to
light
the
coachman
eyes
with
she
smiled
again
and
left
rebecca
with
mouth
gaping
after
the
scurrying
figure
in
the
hut
tessibel
lifted
the
blanket
from
the
scarred
face
and
contemplated
it
earnestly
she
had
forgotten
all
save
the
babe
and
the
student
she
knew
that
the
longman
brat
had
sugar
rags
she
had
arranged
them
herself
many
a
time
tearing
a
piece
from
the
cloth
that
was
wrapped
about
the
child
she
went
to
the
shore
and
washed
it
clean
in
the
blue
lake
water
filling
it
with
bread
and
a
liberal
amount
of
sugar
tessibel
soaked
it
in
some
warm
milk
and
put
the
into
the
small
gaping
mouth
she
must
make
a
place
for
him
to
sleep
during
his
stay
in
the
shanty
daddy
would
not
need
all
the
old
coats
hanging
about
the
wall
and
the
blankets
were
longer
than
was
necessary
from
the
back
of
the
stove
the
squatter
dragged
a
small
box
and
turned
the
splinters
of
wood
into
the
fire
this
too
she
washed
in
the
lake
setting
it
in
the
sun
to
dry
from
one
of
the
hooks
among
the
rafters
she
took
a
which
also
received
its
cleansing
treatment
after
a
bit
of
blanket
had
been
cut
from
those
on
bed
tess
slipped
the
infant
into
the
basket
to
see
if
it
were
long
enough
the
tiny
feet
did
mot
reach
the
bottom
ye
air
to
sleep
many
a
day
in
it
she
said
aloud
for
yer
legs
as
big
as
a
rabbit
and
yer
face
ai
any
beautifuller
than
ma
moll
but
ye
air
a
livin
and
that
air
somethin
hardly
had
she
got
the
words
from
her
lips
and
fitted
the
cover
securely
before
the
door
opened
and
ezra
longman
stepped
into
the
hut
tessibel
clear
hearing
could
detect
an
unmistakable
smack
from
the
babe
what
did

she
asked

myry

ai
air
ye
tess
the
pale
eyes
of
the
young
squatter
boy
darkened
under
the
emotion
that
rose
in
his
breast
he
looked
at
the
girl
he
had
loved
since
she
had
taken
her
first
step
every
wicked
act
he
had
committed
he
laid
fretfully
at
the
door
of
her
refusal
to
marry
him
tessibel
watched
ezra
waiting
for
him
to
speak
again
she
feared
the
child
would
cry
out
feared
that
the
dark
secret
of
the
improvised
cradle
would
get
into
the
hands
of
her
enemies
daddy

to
die
she
said
quietly
giving
the
a
touch
with
her
foot
and
deftly
shoving
it
under
the
bed
another
smack
told
her
that
the
infant
was
awake
and
what

unfathomable
eyes

longman
shanty
and

she
had
quieted
one
of
her
enemies
with
a
promise
which
she
would
never
be
forced
to
keep
for
was
not
the
student
god
going
to
save
daddy
skinner
and
was
she
going
to
auburn
prison
to
see
him
that
clean
skirt
in
the
corner
washed
and
dried
in
the
sun
tess
was
going
to
wear
she
was
going
with
the
great
man
from
the
hill
suddenly
came
the
thought
of
the
babe
with
whom
could
she
leave
it
her
face
whitened
with
grief
of
course
she
could
not
go
now
she
turned
again
to
ezra
who
was
loitering
at
the
door
ye

back
of
the
minister
cottage
with
a
basket
slung
over
her
arm
rebecca
ushered
her
up
the
stairs
to
the
pretty
blue
room
teola
moved
her
head
languidly
but
recognizing
her
visitor
brightened
a
little
i

father
and

walked
to
the
door
and
listened
then
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
she
raised
the
basket
from
the
floor
slipped
back
the
cover
and
teola
graves
was
peeping
in
upon
a
tiny
sleeping
face

with

poor
little
devil
that
night
a
small
figure
left
the
skinner
shanty
bent
upon
an
act
of
theft
up
through
the
lane
to
the
tracks
with
a
small
pail
in
her
hand
tessibel
went
the
brindle
bull
capered
about
her
as
she
slid
through
the
wires
without
the
slightest
compunction
tessibel
returned
to
the
shanty
with
the
warm
milk
which
she
had
taken
from
one
of
the
fine
cows
at
kennedy
then
by
the
light
of
the
candle
she
filled
the
tin
cup
and
warmed
it
over
the
fire
this
too
would
have
to
be
sweetened
spoonful
after
spoonful
she
emptied
into
the
smacking
lips
and
when
the
babe
slept
tess
placed
it
under
the
blankets
and
took
up
the
bible
to
read
of
the
promises
of
the
student
god
chapter
xxix
during
the
illness
of
teola
tessibel
had
forgotten
that
she
had
promised
professor
young
she
would
come
some
morning
to
his
office
in
morril
hall
on
the
hill
two
weeks
after
the
birth
of
the
baby
tess
filled
his
small
stomach
with
warm
milk
shoved
the
sugar
rag
into
his
mouth
hung
the
child
bed
over
her
arm
and
made
off
toward
the
tracks
the
sun
was
far
in
the
heavens
before
she
stopped
at
the
building
in
which
deforest
young
had
his
office
he
was
looking
from
the
window
and
saw
her
glance
about
hastily
settling
the
cover
to
her
basket
a
little
closer
that
child
will
be
my
ruination
he
muttered
seating
himself
at
the
desk
she
affects
me
so
strangely
that
i
ca
get
her
out
of
my
mind
to
bring
her
to
a
place
of
safety
but
what
can
i
do
she
wo
let
me
help
her
the
thought
of
frederick
graves
came
over
him
with
torture
was
it
possible
for
her
to
love
a
lad
who

the
red
curls
covering
the
burden
upon
her
arm
one
would
have
thought
it
was
purposely
done
if
she
had
not
placed
it
carefully
in
the
corner
she
awkwardly
seated
herself
in
the
chair
young

placed
for
her
near
him

her
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
she
hastily
wiped
them
away
with
her
sleeve
of
course

are
going
replied
the
professor
i
suppose
you
think
you
ca
go
in
with
bare
feet
but
i
will
get
you
a
pair
of
shoes

disappointed
if

to
him
when
you
have
promised
he
was
gazing
at
her
keenly
her
eyes
dropped
upon
her
folded
hands
in
her
lap
i
knows
that
she
breathed
but
i
ca
go
just
the
same
young
did
not
persist
in
the
argument
it
is
almost
a
certainty
that
your
father
will
get
another
trial
he
went
on
presently
i
shall
act
as
his
lawyer
and
little
girl
when
the
snow
flies
again
your
father
will
be
home
in
the
cabin
with
you
she
flashed
him
a
radiant
smile
through
the
tears
which
still
clung
to
her
lashes
he
loved
to
watch
the
color
coming
and
going
swiftly
and
the
glints
thrown
into
her
eyes
by
the
sun
it
air
the
student
god
what
will
bring
him
she
bent
eagerly
toward
him
with
a
quick
motion
be
ye
one
of
the
prayin
kind
what
tells
god
all
ye
needs
daddy
would
have
been
by
the
neck
till
he
was
dead
only
the
student
telled
me
how
to
pray
and
he
air
too
she
finished
the
sentence
in
a
low
tone
young
leaned
back
in
his
chair
grasping
at
the
arms
to
hide
his
emotion
the
girl
was
so
close
to
him
that
he
could
feel
her
warm
breath
upon
his
face
how
long
would
he
have
to
suffer
over
this
primitive
child
but
he
loved
her
and
the
only
course
left
him
was
to
snatch
her
from
young
graves
while
there
was
opportunity
to
see
her
now
and
then
her
brown
eyes
were
piercing
his
very
soul
the
childish
excitement
upon
the
upturned
face
almost
tempted
him
to
force
her
into
his
arms
to
awaken
the
soul
beneath
the
soiled
jacket
to
make
the
girl
into
a
woman
in
spite
of
her
environment
you
are
still
determined
to
live
in
the
hut
he
said
after
clearing
his
throat
and
overlooking
her
question
yep
till
daddy
comes
home
and
then
i
to
make
him
get
offen
that
land
it
ai
it
air
minister
graves
but
your
father
has
his
squatter
right
put
in
the
lawyer
feeling
that
he
was
giving
the
student
less
chance
if
he
said
this
no
one
can
take
the
place
from
him
he
ai
got
no
right
there
she
insisted
again
i
asks
the
student
and
he
says
as
how
daddy
can
have
the
ground
by
the
law
but
that
it
air
to
his
pappy
her
face
was
perfectly
grave
and
serious
and
she
spoke
slowly
would
the
name
of
frederick
graves
always
be
flaunted
in
his
face
deforest
young
believed
that
he
was
beginning
to
hate
the
boy
suddenly
he
leaned
over
and
touched
the
bell
it
pealed
loudly
through
the
building
tess
sat
up
the
bell
disturbed
her
and
she
cast
her
eye
upon
the
basket
with
a
shifting
darting
glance
the
janitor
appeared
at
the
door
hyram
said
young

or

rising
with
a
burning
blush
then
what

the
lawyer

when

upon
the
waiting
janitor

exclaimed

between
the
professor
and
the
babe

muttered
sullenly
and
when
i
says

then
why

insisted
young
with
a
motion
of

down
so
carefully

upon
the
handle
of
the
but

obstinately
on
the
other
side
i
ye
to

she
whispered
with
drooping
lids
i
do

at
that
moment
a
wail
from
the
infant
startled
them
both
professor
young
hand
dropped
as
if
it
had
been
struck
tess
only
grasped
the
basket
more
firmly
her
secret
was
out
without
a
word
she
slipped
the
cover
from
the
child
face
and
pushed
the
sugar
rag
into
its
mouth

said
stolidly
a
child
murmured
young

little
bloke
without
no
one
to

and
i
has
him
in
the
basket
that
all
it
seemed
for
a
long
time
to
the
man
that
his
brain
would
burn
from
the
fire
kindled
in
his
heart
the
sight
of
the
marked
baby
horrified
him
but
he
took
the
basket
from
her
hands
and
placed
her
forcibly
in
a
chair
tess
allowed
him
to
do
so
without
speaking
young
set
his
teeth
fiercely
tessibel
skinner

answered
her
eyes
roving
toward
the
babe

glance
sought
his
for
a
twinkling
as
if
she
thought

his
mind
she
shook
her
head
nope
she
was
not
disloyal
to
teola
in
saying

help

to

to

before
the
vivid
mind
of
the
girl
rose
the
handsome
manly
face
of
the
student
her
labor
for
the
child
and
its
mother
had
been
wholly
for
frederick
sake
not
for
anything
in
the
world

consented
to
do
what
she

done
if

she
was
speaking
rapidly
and
had
again
slipped
the
cover
from
the
babe
lifting
it
from
its
bed
the
fire
scar
was
uppermost
and
the
loud
smacking
of
the
child
caused
the
man
to
sink
into
his
seat
the
cheeks
of
the
squatter
denoted
perfect
health
the
eyes
were
wide

and

in

in

jail

before

and
now
in
the
strong
friend
of
her
father
who

his
face
on
the
body
of
the
infant
and

rag
securely
between

and

as

sun
the
strong
form
of
the
lawyer
was
bending
over
her
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
not
realizing
the
greatness
of
his
love
she

that
he

in
his
heart
than

many
weeks

promised

daytime
with
the
alertness
of

indian

crackling
of
twigs
in

underbrush

lock
and
tucked
the

basket
and
waited

at

window
she
saw
ezra

against

flung

from

before

at
the
door
both

and

saw
him
and
tessibel
rose
up
sunday
ai
a
good
day
for

to

she
said
sullenly
i
air
to
be
alone
in
spite
of
the
girl
flashing
eyes
ben
stepped
in
glared
at
ezra
and
took
the
stool
from
which
he
moved
the
bible
with
trembling
hands
tess
had
never
been
quite
so
frightened
never
so
fearful
of
her
own
squatter
ben
and
ezra
had
come
to
stay
a
long
time
for
each
had
dragged
off
his
cap
leaving
his
dirty
head
exposed
still
the
babe
slept
on
no
smack
coming
from
it
tess
lifted
the
bible
determined
to
let
the
men
sit
as
she
read
curled
up
in
the
wooden
rocker
humming
as
she
swung
to
and
fro
a
shadow
dropped
long
upon
the
shanty
floor
in
the
doorway
stood
teola
graves
tall
thin
and
distressingly
pale
tessibel
had
not
seen
her
since
the
day
she
had
carried
the
babe
to
the
that
was
three
whole
weeks
ago
tess
moved
awkwardly
from
the
chair
motioned
for
ezra
longman
to
get
up
and
stuttered
out
an
invitation
for
the
girl
to
be
seated
teola
shook
her
head
and
tess
noted
her
quick
survey
of
the
hut
i
ca
sit
down
she
said
weakly
although
she
allowed
tess
to
place
her
in
the
chair
i
have
been
ill
for
some
time
but
i
could
not
forget
how
kind
you
were
to
me
when
you
found
me
on
the
rocks
with
my
ankle
sprained
the
white
eye
of
ben
followed
the
blue
one
in
its
twisting
search
for
the
minister
daughter
teola
graves
had
lost
her
sparkling
beauty
had
lost
the
vivid
coloring
and
the
shy
expression
of
youth
that
had
rested
in
the
dark
eyes
until
the
death
of
dan
jordan
from
her
face
ben
one
eye
turned
to
the
beautiful
squatter
and
he
settled
back
with
a
firmer
resolve
that
she
should
be
his
tess
stood
thinking
rapidly
she
made
no
attempt
to
introduce
the
strange
trio
then
she
allowed
her
fingers
to
come
in
contact
with
teola
shoulder
pressing
into
the
girl
mind
some
message
ye
be
to
see
the
sick
woman
ai
ye
tess
could
scarcely
utter
the
words
would
teola
understand
what
she
wanted
to
impress
upon
her
her
fingers
sought
the
shoulder
again
yes
came
the
low
answer
might
i
ask
ye
to
take
her
a
bit
of
fish
what
i
promised
her
i
has
company
now
and

i
thought
as
how
if

do
it
for

she
stooped
and
raised
the
in
her
hand
tendering
it
to
teola
the
white
lips
became
paler
the
young
mother
understood

a
nice
day
and
the
sun

a
heap
of
good
explained
tess
if

stared
sharply
ezra
longman
stupidly
shuffled
his
feet
upon
the
floor
teola
accepted
the
basket
and
answered
tess
with
meaning
i
take

for
you
if

some
minutes
tessibel
stood
in
the
door
watching
the
tall
figure
of
the
dominie
daughter
as
she
struggled
through
the
brambles
surrounding
the
creek
until
she
was
lost
to
view
tess
took
a
long
breath
ben
and
ezra
must
go
before
the
babe
returned
she
set
herself
to
rid
the
shanty
of
the
two
men
without
speaking
she
took
the
bible
and
repeated
slowly
aloud
some
of
the
passages
she
knew
best
both
fishermen
stared
at
her
in
admiration
to
read
and
not
spell
out
almost
every
word
was
more
than
ezra
own
mother
could
do
and
she
was
the
person
in
the
settlement
i
know
ye
that
ye
have
not
the

she
replied
her

upon
the
book

ye
ezra
interrupted
the
unfinished
verse

chuckled
ben
suddenly
the
bible
flew
into
the
corner
and
the
girl
with
an
oath
jumped
to
her
feet
neither
man
had
ever
seen
her
in
such
a
temper
she
grasped

broom

she
virtually
swept
her
callers
into
the
sun
and
slammed
the
door
in
their
faces
with
remorse
in
her
heart
she
sought
the
place
where

thrown

beloved

chapter
xxx
tess
closed
the
door
of
her
shanty
looked
about
to
see
if
anyone
were
watching
her
movements
then
she
too
broke
into
the
high
weeds
that
surrounded
the
running
brook
under
the
mud
cellar
her
little
ruse
in
giving
the
child
to
its
mother
delighted
her
she
would
find
teola
and
bring
her
and
the
babe
back
to
the
shanty
softly
she
parted
the
branches
that
hid
the
spot
where
she
had
first
seen
the
daughter
through
the
maze
of
brambles
she
saw
the
girl
with
the
child
clasped
closely
in
her
arms
the
cloth
in
which
tess
had
wrapped
it
had
fallen
from
the
little
shoulders
leaving
them
white
save
for
the
mark
of
fire
teola
lifted
the
infant
and
kissed
it
passionately
bending
her
head
over
it
praying
tess
could
not
enter
upon
such
a
holy
scene
she
sank
down
upon
the
turf
the
basket
yawned
upon
a
bed
of
moss
its
flannel
rags
hanging
over
the
edge
teola
was
making
the
babe
ready
to
return
to
its
bed
when
tess
slipped
under
the
branches
of
the
short
sumac
trees
and
entered
the
clearing
come
back
to
the
shanty
she
said
ye
be

too
large
nope
that

like
that
wait
until
he
gets
some
bigness
he
air
little
yet
i
have
asked
you
tess
and
teola
turned
troubled
eyes
upon
the
squatter
i
have
been
able
to
ask
you
how
you
feed
him
and
where
do
you
get
the
milk
oh
if
i
only

some
money
when

cent

babe
was
still
clasped
in
her
arms
i
crib
it
from
the
cows
at
kennedy
they
all

too
much
for
their
calves
anyhow

but

he

bitter
tears

falling
upon
the
head
of

they
were
the
mother
first
tears
since
that
day
when
tess
had
led
her
up
the
hill
to
the
summer
cottage
but

announced
the
squatter
then
i
do
know
what
to
do
the
brat
air
too
little
to
eat
fish
he
air
suddenly
teola
conceived
an
idea
if
i
should
put
out
a
little
milk
behind
the
house
in
a
pail
could
you
come
after
it
tessibel
yep
replied
tess
eagerly
i
could
crib
it
from
your
yard
if

me
yes

the
way
to
do
replied
teola
with
a
faint
smile
if
i
ca
get
the
milk
out

go
into
the
kitchen
simply
take
all
you
can
get

the
same
time

tessibel
and
in
september
we
go
back
to
the
city
for

takes
us
home
then
if
i
could
only
have
my
own
baby
my
own
precious
baby
tessibel
grunted
teola
misunderstood
her
oh
i
am
grateful
to
you
dear
i
think
that
you
are
the
best
girl
in
all
the
world
so
does
my
brother
frederick
he
says
she
stooped
to
cover
the
child
her
voice
ceasing
the
babe
had
been
carefully
tucked
in
he
a
been
sayin
what
the
tones
of
the
squatter
were
eager
her
eyes
so
bright
that
teola
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
he
says
that
there
is
no
girl
as
good
as
you
and
that
your
faith
in
god
is
what
he
would
rather
have
than
anything
else
in
the
world
oh
tess
if
i
could
only
believe
and
be
sure
that
soon
the
baby
and
i
could
go
to
his
father
if
ye
asks
ye
can
go
replied
tess
solemnly
the
student
says
what
ye
asks
with
faith
ye
get
ai
that
enough
to
prove
it
this
fell
reverently
from
the
lips
of
the
girl
faith
in
frederick
rather
than
faith
in
god
had
given
birth
to
her
believing
soul
but
neither
girl
realized
it
both
were
silent
for
some
minutes
teola
was
looking
dreamily
at
the
opposite
hill
the
basket
with
its
precious
burden
already
hanging
on
the
squatter
arm
tess
had
learned
that
such
loud
smacks
as
the
infant
was
giving
were
indicative
of
hunger
so
she
made
a
move
to
go
i
takes
him
back
to
feed
him
he
air
hungry
oh
tess
if
i
could
only
feed
him
if
i
could
only
always
have
him
i
wish
i
wish
i
were
a
squatter
then
i
would
face
the
world
with
my
baby
oh
i
am
so
unhappy
and
ill
true
she
was
ill
for
there
came
to
tessibel
ears
a
cough
that
echoed
against
the
rocks
with
the
familiar
sound
of
death
in
it
it
sounded
like
that
of
a
fisherwoman
she
had
known
in
a
shanty
below
the
great
rocks
who
had
died
and
been
taken
to
the
potter
field
i
air
every
day
said
tess
with
a
lump
in
her
throat
that
ye
be
taken
with
the
brat
to
the
sky
to
the
brat
pa
what
ye
loves
air
that
the
prayin
ye
wants
teola
nodded
and
tess
smiling
tenderly
hesitated
and
whispered
the
student
god
can
do
anything
he
wants
to
asks
him
to
let
ye
go
ye
be
sick
and
the
brat
air
sick
too
and
the
winter
be
cold
for
him
she
touched
the
handle
on
her
arm
lightly
turned
and
disappeared
teola
sat
for
some
moments
looking
at
the
high
hill
across
the
blue
water
thinking
of
the
next
few
weeks
and
of
how
she
and
the
babe
would
be
called
away
if
she
only
had
the
precious
uplifting
faith
of
tessibel
something
must
come
to
her
and
the
baby
her
stern
father
who
hated
tessibel
skinner
with
all
his
heart
must
never
know
of
the
little
dan
her
mother
weary
and
nervous
would
go
to
her
grave
from
the
shock
and
frederick
teola
straightened
at
the
thought
of
her
brother
he
would
help
her
in
all
things
even
in
the
tragedy
that
now
covered
her
life
of
that
teola
felt
sure
but
the
humiliation
would
be
too
great
better
die
apart
from
her
child
with
another
racking
cough
she
turned
her
face
toward
home
two
hectic
spots
shining
clear
and
red
upon
the
white
cheeks
rebecca
silently
helped
her
to
bed
that
night
at
ten
after
tess
had
silenced
the
child
in
her
arms
and
teola
had
lost
her
nervousness
in
a
stupor
three
boats
shot
from
different
points
of
the
west
shore
and
quietly
oared
a
path
through
the
moonlit
lake
toward
the
netting
place
the
occupants
of
one
boat
were
satisfied
longman
and
his
son
in
another
jake
brewer
sat
alone
in
the
third
ben
letts
puffed
upon
his
pipe
his
thoughts
were
upon
the
one
person
he
desired
tess
like
most
of
mankind
he
wanted
what
he
could
not
get
wanted
the
girl
who
turned
a
mocking
beautiful
face
toward
him
and
used
such
a
bitter
tongue
tess
was
responsible
for
the
scars
upon
his
face
but
he
would
feel
them
well
carried
if
he
gained
the
girl
and
tamed
her
that
tess
was
a
devoted
admirer
of
the
student
graves
made
her
none
the
less
desirable
ben
dipped
his
oars
with
dexterous
aptitude
and
shot
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
an
instant
later
his
boat
was
beside
those
of
the
other
squatters
and
he
was
standing
with
his
hand
upon
the
north
reel
out
into
the
lake
the
net
was
carried
by
satisfied
longman
and
jake
brewer
ben
could
see
the
tall
thin
form
of
ezra
through
the
shadows
guiding
the
ropes
as
they
slipped
through
his
fingers
here
was
a
boy
aspiring
to
the
love
of
tessibel
skinner
ben
heard
the
swish
of
the
net
far
out
in
the
lake
as
it
took
to
the
silent
waters
heard
the
dipping
of
the
oars
and
saw
the
boats
strike
for
the
shore
then
ezra
came
toward
him
at
the
command
of
his
father
satisfied
longman
during
that
evening
deforest
young
was
calling
upon
deacon
hall
he
refused
the
deacon
invitation
to
row
him
to
the
city
thanks
said
he
but
the
night
is
delightful
i
think
i
shall
walk
i
shall
go
by
the
shore
and
skirt
to
the
tracks
at
the
hoghole
he
failed
to
say
however
that
his
reason
for
walking
was
that
he
desired
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
tess
he
had
not
seen
her
since
the
discovery
of
the
babe
the
candle
was
lighted
in
the
skinner
hut
and
he
tapped
gently
for
an
instant
there
was
no
response
he
knew
the
girl
was
at
home
there
had
been
a
sudden
discontinuance
of
a
humming
when
he
knocked
miss
skinner
it
is
i
professor
young
he
called
if
it
is
too
late
i
will
come
again
the
door
was
promptly
thrown
open

in
said
tess
with
a
smile
i
thought
as
how

been
at
deacon
hall

he
they
agree
with
me
that
you
ought
to
go
and
see
your
father
i
did
not
tell
them
why
you
could
not
where
is
the
little
child
tess
glanced
at
the
babe
i
keeps
him
in
the
basket
or
the
box
in
the
daytime
but
nights
i
takes
him
to
bed
with
me
the
rats
be
so
dum
thick
that
one
of
them
big
fellers
would
chew
the
little
chap
ear
offen
him
afore
i
could
stop
it
she
said
it
so
naturally
as
if
she
were
speaking
of
the
most
ordinary
thing
that
young
felt
a
hysterical
desire
to
laugh
it
was
a
dreadful
thought
this
of
the
rat
in
the
box
with
the
babe
are
the
men
netting
he
asked
quickly
changing
the
subject
yep
they
be
i
suppose
there
is
no
stopping
it
sighed
young
and
they
run
such
dreadful
risks
but
if
there
were
no
laws
about
it
there
would
be
no
fish
left
in
the
lake
tessibel
brow
gathered
a
thick
network
of
wrinkles
she
had
heard
the
subject
discussed
and
argued
from
her
babyhood
days
the
best
fish
in
the
waters
must
be
kept
for
the
gentlemen
who
came
for
sport
during
the
season
but
the
fishermen
who
needed
bread
for
their
families
were
forced
by
the
law
to
go
without
there
ought
to
be
no
laws
about
fishin
she
frowned
in
decision
it
air
wicked
when
brats
air
bread
and
beans
young
saw
danger
ahead
in
the
argument
so
he
switched
to
the
of
the
minister
family
from
that
he
again
spoke
of
the
infant
who
was
whimpering
a
little
tess
took
him
up
and
warmed
the
milk
i
shall
go
now
child
said
young
rising
you
are
tired
you
ought
to
go
to
bed
yep
i
air
tired
i
air
answered
tess
wearily
once
out
upon
the
shore
young
looked
back
at
the
hut
it
was
dark
he
saw
three
boats
flit
silently
by
him
toward
the
city
as
if
phantoms
guided
them
they
crossed
the
moonbeams
and
young
lost
them
in
the
dark
shadows
near
the
shore
chapter
xxxi
keeping
to
the
water
edge
professor
young
walked
rapidly
toward
ithaca
he
knew
that
further
up
the
shore
the
fishermen
were
drawing
their
nets
he
did
not
wish
to
advance
upon
them
since
knowing
tessibel
skinner
he
had
become
more
lenient
toward
the
he
turned
into
the
forest
at
the
side
of
the
hoghole
but
the
sound
of
voices
brought
him
to
a
standstill
ezra
longman
was
shouting
out
a
threat
ye
be
to
get
tess
and
i
tells
ye
to
look
out
shet
up
responded
ben
letts
if

the
boy
voice
again
i
says
for
ye
to
keep
away
from
her
i
lives
i
lives
and
i
ai
afraid
of
ye
nohow
the
professor
barely
caught
the
words
for
they
were
gurgled
in
the
deep
throat
i
wants
tess
for
a
woman
ben
broke
out
and
for
a
woman
i
air
to
have
her
she
care
for
mammy
and
me
i
gets
her
see
the
north
reel
stopped
turning
but
the
south
one
went
on
silently
ben
letts
and
ezra
longman
were
turning
over
and
over
on
the
sand
at
grips
with
each
other
professor
young
uttered
no
word
then
ezra
voice
came
from
under
big
body
i
tells
what
i
knows
about
skinner
if
ye
do
get
up
and
let
me
be
said
he
i
tells
red
fingers
closed
over
his
throat
and
ezra
longman
spoke
no
more
as
the
south
reel
kept
turning
around
and
around
the
rope
slackened
from
the
north
reel
in
the
water
and
still
ben
letts
held
his
deadly
fingers
pressed
about
the
neck
of
his
enemy
professor
young
saw
ben
sit
up
and
bend
his
head
to
the
heart
of
the
other
fisherman
then
with
a
furtive
glance
about
he
lifted
the
boy
in
his
arms
and
came
toward
young
grunting
under
his
burden
young
drew
back
into
the
overhanging
branches
the
squatter
stumbled
up
the
rocks
dragging
the
boy
after
him
and
with
a
mighty
effort
lifted
him
high
in
the
air
and
tumbled
the
body
into
the
hoghole
in
another
instant
ben
was
back
upon
the
shore
at
the
reel
turning
swiftly
until
silently
it
caught
up
with
the
other
just
as
the
net
dragged
in
the
shallow
waters
with
bushels
of
flopping
fish
inside
professor
young
lowered
himself
into
the
hoghole
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
use
the
greatest
caution
the
lad
came
to
the
surface
directly
below
him
and
the
professor
saw
him
catch
at
a
jagged
end
of
a
rock
can
you
breathe
asked
young
in
a
low
voice
and
can
you
help
yourself
a
little
yep
came
back
the
faint
answer
then
when
i
put
out
my
foot
take
hold
of
it
and
make
no
noise
for
your
enemy
is
but
a
short
distance
away
and
he
meant
to
kill
you
now
come
up
there
do
lean
too
heavily
upon
me
for
the
rocks
are
slippery
without
any
more
conversation
the
two
men
one
wet
and
weak
with
bleeding
head
with
a
gash
over
his
right
brow
crossed
the
forest
toward
the
tracks
by
dint
of
persuasion
young
forced
the
boy
to
give
his
father
name
he
had
caught
enough
of
the
talk
between
the
fishermen
to
know
that
tess
was
the
cause
of
their
quarrel
but
what
ezra
had
threatened
to
tell
about
skinner
he
did
not
know
two
miles
from
ithaca
the
boy
became
and
feeble
his
tongue
was
loosened
in
his
delirium
and
young
heard
a
story
that
made
his
heart
beat
faster
and
revived
hopes
he
had
considered
almost
dead
through
the
moonbeams
that
slanted
to
the
tracks
he
imagined
he
saw
a
little
figure
skirting
the
rays
with
flying
red
hair
not
for
anything
in
the
world
would
he
lose
sight
of
the
boy
he
had
the
first
clue
in
the
case
that
so
interested
him
acquittal
for
the
father
of
tessibel
skinner
was
within
his
grasp
it
was
late
when
he
dragged
ezra
laughing
and
gibbering
into
a
private
hospital
he
installed
a
nurse
beside
the
boy
bidding
her
keep
a
record
of
any
delirious
mutterings
he
might
make
and
to
observe
silence
about
them
ben
letts
wondered
what
satisfied
longman
would
ask
about
his
son
he
spoke
to
the
father
first
his
thick
brain
trying
to
avoid
trouble
ye
air
both
got
a
lot
of
nerve
to
keep
three
men
at
the
south
reel
when
i
air
the
only
one
here
where
ezy
asked
longman
there
was
no
anxiety
in
his
voice
he
was
tumbling
the
fish
into
the
cars
i
ai
no
way
where
he
air
he
skipped
away
and
said
how
he
wanted
to
speak
to
his
pappy
and
i
ai
seed
him
since
ezy
were
a
fool
when
he
was
born
gone
home
like
a
sneakin
kid
put
in
jake
brewer
he
ai
no
hankerin
for
nettin
he
ai
been
right
since
orn
skinner
shot
the
gamekeeper
he
air
my
brat
replied
longman
and
he
air
good
if
he
does
do
what
he
ought
to
sometimes
i
air
satisfied
with
him
let
go
home
and
silently
as
a
spectral
fleet
the
boats
lapped
their
way
back
edging
the
shore
carefully
far
into
the
night
satisfied
longman
and
the
tired
mother
waited
for
their
boy
he
show
up
to
soothed
the
father
but
the
mother
trembled
with
terror
it
was
the
first
evening
ezra
had
missed
the
netting
and
he
had
never
been
from
home
for
a
whole
night
as
day
after
day
passed
it
was
noised
about
the
settlement
that
ezra
longman
had
run
away
some
saying
that
he
had
been
seen
upon
a
line
of
canal
boats
going
to
albany
the
mother
watched
each
hour
for
some
word
from
him
then
with
a
sorrowful
expression
in
the
faded
eyes
she
said
to
myra
if
ezy
had
had
any
edication
he
writ
he
be
home
some
of
these
days
after
that
the
fisherman
hut
carried
along
its
usual
routine
while
a
boy
in
the
city
was
wrestling
with
fever
and
the
head
of
the
law
school
hung
upon
his
muttered
words
with
avidity
you
think
he
is
very
ill
tess
teola
asked
early
one
evening
in
september
when
she
and
tessibel
were
alone
in
the
skinner
hut
tess
came
forward
to
the
wooden
box
holding
in
her
hand
the
filled
with
bacon
fat
and
gazed
down
upon
the
baby
dan
contemplating
the
wee
face
thoughtfully
he
air
sick
he
air
a
look
on
him
what
air
on
myry
brat
kind
of
sickly
that
air
because
he
has
so
many
lines
in
his
face
and
he
air
so
little
she
finished
wrinkling
the
cheeks
and
shrugging
her
shoulders
almost
disdainfully
teola
knelt
down
and
slipped
one
slender
arm
under
the
dark
head
these
two
girls
had
been
drawn
together
during
the
past
few
weeks
by
a
tie
stronger
than
death
it
had
brought
frederick
nearer
to
the
squatter
and
little
did
teola
realize
that
had
it
not
been
for
her
handsome
brother
her
secret
would
have
been
discovered
long
before
it
was
of
him
she
was
thinking
as
she
bent
over
the
babe
on
this
stormy
september
night
in
the
fisherman
hut
i
may
not
be
able
to
come
down
tessibel
she
said
looking
up
into
the
serious
face
because
my
brother
is
coming
home
early
in
the
morning
the
fell
to
the
floor
the
fat
spattered
and
ran
across
the
broken
tilted
boards
until
it
congealed
into
rounded
miniature
mountains
teola
turned
a
puzzled
face
toward
the
fishermaid
but
there
was
nothing
about
the
girl
to
tell
her
why
the
accident
had
happened
for
tessibel
grappling
with
a
huge
cloth
was
wiping
the
floor
furiously
i
was
saying
tess
repeated
teola
that
i
may
not
come
down
oh
hear
how
it
rains
and
the
thunder
tess
since
he
died
and
the
baby
came
make
me
shiver
it
ai
nothin
that
hurt
ye
grunted
tess
from
her
position
on
the
floor
i
know
it
unless
one
stands
directly
in
the
lightning
path
but
i
am
such
a
coward
tessibel
you
have
so
much
faith
that
why
you
not
afraid
the
pathetic
face
turned
suddenly
upon
tess
with
a
questioning
look
my
brother
you
know
thinks
you
are
such
a
good
girl
and
and
you
are
a
good
girl
are
you
tess
squatters
ai
never
good
answered
tess
in
a
low
tone
her
eyes
dropping
under
the
steady
gaze
of
the
other
girl
but
i
i
love
the
student
god
i
does
she
was
standing
with
rag
hanging
from
her
right
hand
her
face
illumined
by
a
deep
flush
that
disappeared
only
when
it
met
the
red
hair
i
believe
that
you
do
love
him
tess
teola
breathed
and
frederick
told
me
that
if
he
had
your
faith
he
could
do
anything
in
the
world
you
know
the
bible
says
that
if
we
had
faith
as
large
as
a
mustard
seed
we
could
move
a
mountain
her
voice
faltered
on
the
last
words
tess
grunted
significantly
aw
a
mustard
seed
ai
no
bigger
than
a
speck
of
dirt
i
know
it
tess
i
know
it
but
one
only
has
to
have
a
little
faith
in
god
to
enable
him
to
answer
every
prayer
we
utter
she
grasped
the
thin
baby
to
her
breast
frantically
kissed
the
crimson
mark
up
and
down
until
where
the
frenzied
lips
had
traveled
the
flesh
turned
purple
oh
to
have
faith
to
believe
that
she
might
soon
have
her
child
with
her
always
always
of
late
there
had
crept
over
teola
the
shadow
of
the
great
beyond
into
which
her
student
lover
had
been
so
hastily
summoned
the
shrieking
of
the
wind
and
the
mournful
fluttering
of
the
tiny
hands
made
her
shiver
and
she
coughed
slightly
a
mountain
air
bigger
than
that
hill
with
the
on
it
ruminated
tess
picking
up
a
huge
knot
of
wood
from
behind
the
stove
i
know
that
too
replied
teola
for
the
space
of
many
minutes
only
the
smacking
of
the
baby
lips
upon
the
sugar
rag
and
the
roaring
of
the
turbulent
wind
were
heard
in
the
hut
suddenly
the
vibrations
of
a
great
peal
of
thunder
shook
the
shanty
with
violent
effect
a
streak
of
lightning
shot
through
the
room
like
some
livid
malicious
spirit
teola
screamed
in
terror
it
hit
some
place
near
here
said
tess
yes
and
was
it
awful
oh
if
the
storm
would
only
cease
it
air
comin
nearer
answered
tess
with
the
keen
instincts
of
a
squatter
it
air
got
to
turn
sidewise
through
the
window
afore
it
goes
over
the
hill
what
air
ye
afraid
of
if
ye
believes
that
ye
can
move
a
mountain
if
ye
has
the
faith
god
would
hit
the
brat
with
lightnin
would
he
oh
i
have
the
faith
tess
moaned
teola
rocking
to
and
fro
in
her
keen
agony
of
soul
long
ago
i
stopped
believing
the
way
i
did
when
i
was
a
child
i
prayed
that
night
when
dan
was
killed
until
my
head
ached
and
pounded
for
days
i
wanted
to
see
him
once
more
and
god
would
let
me
and
then
i
prayed
again
teola
buried
her
face
in
the
breast
of
the
infant
and
sobbed
i
prayed
that
the
baby
might
die
when
he
was
born
but
god
did
see
fit
to
take
him
somehow
it
does
do
any
good
to
pray
any
more
tess
paused
in
her
work
standing
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
a
solemn
expression
in
the
long
eyes
yer
faith
was
as
big
as
a
speck
of
dirt
then
were
it
she
queried
and
maybe
mine
ai
for
daddy
but
the
student
air
for
him
it
air
a
damn
shame
ye
ai
got
him
for
yerself
and
the
kid
ye
a
seen
yer
man
before
now
and
the
brat
would
died
too
with
a
start
caused
by
the
squatter
words
teola
laid
the
child
down
crouching
back
upon
her
feet
she
eyed
the
critically
what
a
strange
mixture
of
good
and
bad
of
the
holy
and
the
unholy
lived
in
the
tawny
magnificent
squatter
she
answered
hesitatingly
but
if
my
brother
should
know
about
the
baby
it
would
break
my
heart
tessibel
it
would
kill
me
and
him
too
nothing
could
ever
make
me
tell
him
you
understand
do
you
tess
yep
it
was
as
tess
had
said
the
storm
was
coming
nearer
sending
vivid
shafts
of
lightning
in
splendid
awfulness
across
the
sky
torrents
of
rain
descended
thrashing
the
lake
into
uneven
towering
crests
of
white
foam
the
weeping
willow
tree
groaned
over
the
shanty
roof
jarring
and
tearing
at
the
broken
bits
of
tarred
tin
tess
tess
how
can
you
bear
that
awful
noise
constantly
through
the
night
it
frightens
me
to
death
it
sounds
like
the
spirits
of
people
who
are
dead
she
shivered
again
the
cutting
rasp
from
the
chimney
place
stinging
her
with
fright
it
air
spirits
replied
tess
softly
there
air
one
kind
of
spirits
for
the
sun
when
it
air
and
the
waves
just
over
the
lake
they
air
good
spirits
but
on
nights
like
this
there
air
bad
ones
the
ghosts
of
indians
squaws
and
sometimes
of
the
family
them
dead
she
paused
her
low
voice
trailing
into
silence
on
that
one
word
dead
the
luminous
eyes
burning
with
superstitious
fear
how
many
times
had
the
squaw
and
her
burnt
brat
now
long
since
called
to
the
land
of
their
fathers
moaned
through
the
winter
nights
making
the
shanty
ring
with
their
piteous
plaints
how
many
times
tessibel
had
imagined
that
she
had
seen
the
headless
man
from
haytes
corner
flit
from
the
shadows
of
the
long
lane
and
lose
himself
in
the
overhanging
willows
on
the
shore
suddenly
a
foreign
sound
pierced
the
storm
tessibel
drew
near
teola
both
girls
were
standing
over
the
wooden
box
the
violence
of
the
storm
impelled
them
to
grasp
each
other
hands
in
through
the
broken
window
the
strange
sound
was
borne
again
a
boat
agin
the
shore
said
tess
quietly
some
one
air
in
out
of
the
rain
the
words
were
only
formed
on
her
lips
when
the
door
opened
abruptly
tessibel
turned
her
head
teola
dropped
her
hand
and
uttered
a
cry
frederick
graves
with
his
fingers
upon
the
door
was
closing
it
against
the
fury
of
the
storm
chapter
xxxii
you
did
mind
my
running
in
did
you
tessibel
asked
frederick
turning
toward
the
squatter
with
a
broad
smile
then
he
noticed
his
sister
with
surprise
ah
teola
you
too
were
caught
in
the
storm
what
a
blessing
to
have
a
shelter
like
this
miss
tessibel
wo
mind
if
we
stay
until
it
is
over
i
came
home
before
i
was
expected
i
almost
wish
now
that
i
had
waited
until
morning
but
i
am
safe
here
though
whew
it
is
a
terrible
night
the
distance
between
teola
and
tessibel
widened
perceptibly
neither
girl
attempted
to
speak
and
the
student
smiled
at
the
embarrassment
upon
his
sister
face
he
made
to
go
toward
her
you
need
mind
being
here
dear
he
said
in
a
low
tone
i
believe
as
father
and
mother
do
i
should
ask
for
you
to
be
in
a
better
place
than
this
hut
he
turned
his
face
toward
the
roof
letting
his
eyes
sweep
the
cobwebbed
net
the
old
coats
upon
the
wall
and
lastly
to
the
stove
out
of
the
top
of
which
jutted
the
smoking
knot
there
is
here
he
continued
impressively
a
feeling
of
rest
and
contentment
to
me
i
believe
tessibel
skinner
that
your
faith
permeates
every
inch
of
it
he
lifted
the
lid
of
the
stove
and
shoved
the
smouldering
wood
from
sight
his
deep
voice
came
again
to
tessibel
ears
as
if
from
afar
i
wish
i
could
impress
upon
my
father
what
it
means
to
pray
and
be
good
and
pure
under
such
circumstances
as
surround
you
i
mean
you
know
tess
here
he
turned
squarely
upon
her
i
mean
that
for
one
so
young
you
have
purity
of
faith
and
uplifted
confidence
in
god
goodness
his
voice
was
silenced
by
a
cry
dragging
itself
from
the
squatter
throat
then
he
noted
that
something
was
wrong
teola
pale
and
wretched
had
gradually
placed
a
greater
distance
between
herself
and
the
wooden
box
tess
had
involuntarily
drawn
closer
to
it
she
dully
comprehended
that
teola
was
ashamed
of
the
body
struggling
for
a
mere
existence
expressions
of
consternation
of
indecision
and
terror
swept
over
her
face
her
eyes
dropped
for
an
instant
upon
the
silent
infant
the
child
gave
one
great
yawn
and
whiningly
dropped
the
sugar
rag
just
at
this
juncture
lightning
flashed
through
the
cracked
window
and
played
above
the
face
of
the
babe
until
the
red
of
the
fire
mark
from
head
to
shoulder
glowed
crimson
under
the
blotched
skin
the
tiny
scrawny
arms
were
bare
the
withered
mouth
opened
and
shut
gapingly
as
the
eyes
of
the
boy
fell
upon
it
he
went
so
deadly
white
that
tess
thought
he
was
going
to
fall
without
a
word
he
walked
to
the
box
considering
the
wrinkled
baby
face
like
a
man
in
a
trance
his
gaze
took
in
the
flaming
brand
the
gray
eyes
fastened
upon
the
candlelight
and
the
tiny
searching
fingers
which
constantly
sought
something
they
could
not
find
it
seemed
an
eternity
before
he
gathered
himself
together
forcing
his
eyes
upward
to
rest
first
on
teola
then
upon
tess
he
was
the
first
to
speak
where
did
that
child
come
from
there
was
imperious
inquisition
in
the
dark
eyes
his
voice
had
changed
until
the
deepness
of
it
was
terrifying
teola
came
nearer
to
him
tessibel
dropped
down
beside
the
infant
i
want
to
know
where
that
child
came
from
commanded
the
boy
once
more
whose
child
is
it
tess
swung
her
body
round
upon
the
shanty
floor
turning
cloudy
rebuking
eyes
upon
teola
she
tessibel
skinner
crouching
over
dan
jordan
baby
had
sworn
never
to
tell
frederick
his
secret
and
no
thought
of
doing
so
entered
her
mind
the
daughter
must
speak
the
truth
the
mother
of
the
babe
would
answer
the
question
put
by
the
student
quickly
tess
turned
over
her
great
desire
for
the
freedom
of
her
father
followed
by
the
passionate
wish
to
retain
the
love
and
prayers
of
frederick
graves
if
she
denied
the
child
he
would
turn
upon
his
sister
and
the
shivering
girl
would
divulge
her
trouble
it
would
be
the
same
as
breaking
her
oath
yet
frederick
must
not
think
the
child
hers
she
turned
toward
teola
again
and
seemed
about
to
open
her
lips
when
the
expression
upon
the
other
girl
face
stayed
her
tongue
it
was
a
mixture
of
despair
illness
and
fright
tessibel
imagined
she
had
discovered
beneath
the
face
a
desire
to
claim
her
own
ah
teola
would
gather
her
babe
that
tiny
bit
of
shriveled
flesh
into
her
arms
before
the
whole
world
there
rose
in
the
squatter
heart
a
vast
respect
for
myra
longman
who
had
taken
her
child
from
the
beginning
of
its
tiny
life
and
defied
the
babbling
tongues
of
the
settlement
gossips
teola
graves
although
of
a
different
class
was
no
less
a
mother
she
would
do
the
same
tessibel
sat
up
waiting
for
the
confession
why
was
the
minister
daughter
so
silent
why
so
deathly
looking
i
will
be
answered
insisted
the
student
then
centering
his
eyes
full
upon
tess
he
added
tessibel
skinner
is
yours
teola
lips
were
pressed
closely
together
spasms
of
pain
drew
them
down
at
the
corners
making
the
girl
resemble
a
woman
twice
her
years
with
a
sudden
inspiration
she
turned
upon
her
brother
frederick
frederick
she
stammered
do
blame
her
too
much
she
is
only
a
girl
a
cry
escaped
from
the
lips
of
frederick
another
followed
from
those
of
tess
the
minister
daughter
was
throwing
the
motherhood
of
the
babe
upon
her
teola
had
branded
her
squatter
savior
with
a
nameless
child
a
horror
from
which
the
student
shrank
she
saw
unbelief
rise
quickly
in
his
eyes
and
saw
him
draw
aside
his
long
as
it
almost
touched
the
box
upon
the
floor
shrinking
disgust
of
the
wriggling
whimpering
thing
on
the
rags
made
frederick
involuntarily
reach
out
his
hand
to
his
sister
but
his
eyes
were
bent
upon
tess
and
you
the
girl
i
trusted
he
gasped
as
teola
neared
him
slowly
yours
is
the
faith
i
envied
your
life
the
one
standard
i
wish
to
gain
god
he
groaned
you
you
you
the
mother
of
that
his
bitter
tones
stung
her
to
the
quick
whipping
her
into
immediate
action
fire
and
swift
as
lightning
swept
into
the
flashing
eyes
frederick
sister
had
thrust
the
child
upon
her
the
secret
was
dead
between
them
tess
remembered
her
oath
remembered
her
love
for
the
boy
and
teola
cowardice
her
despair
gathered
as
her
false
position
was
forced
upon
her
she
stooped
and
grasped
the
babe
in
her
hands
with
a
passion
that
tore
the
meager
clothing
from
its
body
she
crushed
the
infant
to
her
as
if
indeed
teola
words
were
true
the
small
dark
head
fell
limply
upon
her
bosom
the
thin
legs
hung
straight
and
bare
over
the
soiled
jacket
one
little
hand
clutched
her
torn
sleeve
as
if
there
lived
in
the
a
fear
of
harm
tess
instinct
with
potent
life
and
rage
wheeled
like
a
tawny
tigress
furiously
upon
frederick
and
teola
air
it
any
of
yer
damn
business
she
demanded
hotly
if
i
wants
to
have
a
brat
she
had
silenced
the
student
by
the
condemning
words
which
seared
his
soul
like
molten
lead
a
dazed
terror
gathered
in
his
eyes
he
smoothed
his
forehead
with
trembling
fingers
the
lightning
forked
about
the
squatter
and
the
babe
illuminating
the
small
head
and
the
bony
body
of
the
child
tess
felt
it
shiver
and
mechanically
she
lifted
her
skirt
wrapping
him
close
within
it
her
gaze
took
in
sneeringly
the
shrinking
form
of
teola
and
the
arm
of
the
student
encircling
his
sister
waist
for
one
instant
she
hated
them
both
with
all
the
strength
of
her
nature
still
no
thought
came
of
breaking
her
promise
ye
can
both
go
to
hell
she
ended
distinctly
a
fierce
cry
from
frederick
closed
her
lips
and
the
anger
within
her
changed
to
terror
what
was
she
doing
blasting
his
love
his
faith
his
confidence
with
words
that
blackened
her
soul
with
perfidy
and
her
life
with
dishonor
had
she
not
told
the
student
that
night
that
she
loved
him
that
she
was
his
squatter
for
ever
and
ever
and
was
she
not
now
at
this
moment
keeping
a
secret
from
him
for
his
own
sake
something
in
her
small
ghastly
face
brought
the
lad
in
his
boyish
agony
impulsively
forward
for
god
love
and
mine
tess
tell
me
it
is
true
tell
me
you
are
shielding
someone
else
teola
caught
her
breath
painfully
and
frederick
ended
some
other
squatter
girl
i
ai
got
no
other
squatter

she
cried
turning
her
eyes
upon

frederick
replied
teola
white
and
wan
she
has
told
you
the
truth
it
is
another
squatter
child
hope
died
in
the
boy
and
outraged
feeling
leaped
into
its
place
he
held
tessibel
eyes
with
his
relentlessly
did
you
expect
to
mix
prayers
for
your
father
with
filth
like
that
he
demanded
pointing
to
the
hidden
infant
in
the
fold
of
her
dress
did
you
expect
god
to
hear
you
when
your
life
was
full
of
sin
i
am
ashamed
i
ever
loved
you
ashamed
that
i
took
my
life
from
your
hands
i
wish
i
were
dead
i
wish
i
were
dead
teola
gasped
in
her
new
understanding
the
squatter
and
her
handsome
brother
loved
each
other
never
for
one
moment
had
it
dawned
upon
her
until
she
saw
the
tall
boy
drop
beside
the
stool
and
sob
out
his
heart
agony
upon
the
open
bible
if
she
dared
speak
the
truth
she
could
assure
him
of
the
goodness
of
the
but
her
lips
sealed
themselves
with
her
soul
consent
she
raised
her
face
giving
tess
one
look
of
terror
reaching
out
she
touched
her
brother
arm
frederick
come
home
with
me
this
is
awful
awful
i
do
want
to
go
home
sobbed
the
boy
in
pitiful
abandon
i
know
anything
could
be
so
hard
to
bear
and
i
loved
her
faith
and
her
character
and
her
beautiful
face
oh
i
love
her
i
love
her
teola
the
squatter
listened
to
every
passionate
word
listened
until
her
face
whitened
into
a
despair
that
settled
there
and
did
not
vanish
she
had
not
moved
from
the
wooden
box
nor
ceased
pressing
the
infant
to
her
breast
turning
she
shot
a
glance
at
the
other
girl
who
owed
her
very
life
to
her
the
glance
pleaded
for
the
miserable
boy
by
the
stool
for
the
sick
babe
held
close
to
her
heart
and
lastly
for
herself
her
squatter
honor
and
the
powerful
love
she
had
for
the
student
brother
from
the
depths
of
her
eyes
came
a
demand
to
teola
that
she
tell
the
truth
the
answer
was
but
a
slight
negative
shake
of
the
head
followed
by
an
embarrassment
that
teola
covered
by
leaning
over
her
brother
and
raising
him
from
the
floor
frederick
allowed
his
sister
to
lead
him
by
the
wooden
box
past
tessibel
to
the
door
his
eyes
traveled
back
to
the
open
bible
upon
the
stool
where
but
a
moment
since
his
own
dark
head
had
rested
then
he
laughed
laughed
until
the
sharp
sting
of
his
tones
made
the
grunt
in
her
characteristic
way
striding
forward
he
snatched
up
the
book
tore
off
the
covers
and
in
another
minute
had
thrust
it
through
the
smoke
into
the
stove
there
goes
your
faith
your
canting
trash
about
your
love
for
the
saviour
i
might
have
known
that
one
of
your
kind
could
not
rise
above
the
grossness
in
you
i
hope
you
will
be
as
miserable
and
as
unhappy
as
i
am
i
hope
that
child
will
tess
stopped
him
with
a
cry
she
stooped
down
and
placed
the
little
dan
in
his
bed
without
a
word
her
anger
was
gone
and
from
the
waters
of
bitterness
that
swept
over
her
a
better
tess
lived
her
faith
in
the
boy
died
instantly
and
a
higher
nobler
and
greater
faith
in
the
crucified
saviour
lived
instead
she
would
never
tell
frederick
that
his
sister
was
mother
to
the
little
being
he
had
scorned
nor
would
she
as
much
as
utter
the
name
of
dan
jordan
covering
the
child
tenderly
she
faced
frederick
graves
without
a
touch
of
the
awkward
girlishness
that
had
hitherto
marked
her
movements
a
glorified
expression
lightened
the
white
face
and
shone
from
her
eyes
he
had
taught
her
a
lesson
of
independence
she
could
not
have
learned
through
any
other
person
without
one
glance
at
the
shivering
young
mother
she
walked
to
the
door
and
opened
it
as
she
had
done
that
night
when
he
had
come
first
to
the
hut
ye

said

rain
rushed
in
through

open
door

wind
shook
the
dust
in
clouds
from
the
overhanging
nets
waving
the
long
cobwebs
that
hung
in
fine
threads
from
the
ceiling
into
fantastic
figures
frederick
still
supporting
his
sister
stepped
into
the
glare
of
the
lightning
tess
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
stood
with
her
back
against
it
the
high
chest
lifted
and
lifted
the
white
tightened
throat
choking
down
the
sobs
that
tried
to
force
themselves
to
her
lips
she
were
a
damn
sneak

the
first
words
she
said
shudderingly
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
aw

twisting
and
turning
for
more
sugar
a
whine
from
its
lips
drew
tess
slowly
toward
it
she
stood
looking
down
upon
it
for
many
minutes
the
baby
had
taken
away
her
all
for
tess
realized
now
the
extent
of
her
love
for
frederick
nothing
would
make
the
days
shorter
there
was
no
looking
forward
to
a
kindly
nod
or
a
gracious
word
from
him
i

said
out
loud
slowly
leaning
over
the
infant
with
a
frown
on
her
face
but
i

she
burst
forth
in
sudden
anger
ye
ai
no
right
in
this
shanty
her
eyes
glittered
with
rage
and
humiliation
her
head
sank
nearer
and
nearer
the
child
her
shock
of
red
hair
falling
like
a
mantle
of
gold
across
its
thin
body
the
twisting
fingers
entangled
themselves
in
the
tawny
curls
drawing
the
squatter
down
until
her
face
was
almost
in
the
box
with
a
grunt
of
abhorrence
she
spread
out
the
wiry
little
hands
extricating
lock
after
lock
once
free
she
squatted
back
upon
her
feet
scrutinizing
the
child
with
no
sign
of
sympathy
in
her
eyes
suddenly
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
forest
and
the
lake
beyond
through
the
window
she
could
see
the
rain
falling
in
quantities
into
the
water
and
the
great
in
which
sat
her
god
of
majesty
whitened
under
the
glare
of
lightning

girl
rose
unsteadily
to
her
feet
pressing
her
face
to
the
smeared
pane
she
saw
the
jagged
lightning
tearing
again
toward
the
tree
then
it
played
about
the
figure
that
tess
had
grown
to
love
the
old
man
amid
the
branches
bent
toward
the
squatter
and
held
out
his
waving
arms
a
cry
burst
from
lips
she
opened
the
door
standing
in
bold
relief
against
the
candlelight
and
shot
her
hands
far
into
the
dark
night
oh
goddy
goddy
she
breathed
catching
her
breath
in
stifling
sobs
the
student
air
gone
and
the
bible
air
burnt
and
daddy
air
in
a
prison
cell
i
asks
ye
she
turned
with
heaving
bosom
without
finishing
bending
over
the
child
she
drew
him
into
her
arms
with
the
same
sublime
expression
of
suffering
she
went
back
to
the
open
door
and
knelt
in
the
beating
rain
and
tendered
the
little
child
toward
the
god
of
her
dreams
it
please
ye
goddy
to
bless
the
brat
and
tess
the
student
was
no
longer
the
motive
power
of
her
prayer
tess
the
squatter
was
struggling
with
a
new
faith
of
her
own
flash
after
flash
brightened
the
sky
and
still
she
knelt
offering
the
sick
child
for
her
god
to
bless
one
long
peal
of
thunder
shook
the
inky
waters
and
rumbled
reverberatingly
into
the
hills
tessibel
eyes
were
riveted
upon
the
the
wind
dropped
the
shaking
branches
for
a
minute
the
arms
extended
straight
toward
her
with
tears
she
bowed
over
the
wailing
baby
and
stood
up
with
a
long
breath
goddy
goddy
it
air
hard
work
for
ye
to
forgive
tessibel
i
knows
i
loved
the
student
best
a
sob
tightened
her
throat
i
love
you
best
and
and
the
man
hanging
on
the
cross
she
closed
the
hut
door
and
seated
herself
at
the
oven
and
warmed
the
infant
with
tender
solicitude
forcing
the
warm
sweetened
water
into
the
meager
body
then
she
slipped
off
her
clothes
gathered
the
little
dan
to
her
breast
and
crept
into
bed
i
said
as
how
i
hated
ye
brat
she
whispered
but
i
do
hate
ye
now
poor
little
shiverin
dum
devil
during
the
rest
of
the
storm
the
babe
slept
but
tessibel
wept
out
her
loss
of
the
only
love
she
had
ever
known
save
daddy
skinner
wept
until
from
sheer
exhaustion
her
head
dropped
upon
the
dark
one
of
dan
jordan
babe
and
she
slept
the
next
morning
tess
rose
languidly
without
a
smile
or
a
prayer
she
arranged
the
sop
for
the
babe
then
sat
down
beside
him
to
think
such
a
radical
change
in
her
life
brought
an
influx
of
indescribable
emotions
her
bible
was
gone
the
one
book
out
of
which
she
was
learning
the
secret
of
happiness
and
patience
she
remembered
how
the
night
before
the
realization
of
her
despair
had
brought
her
closer
to
the
cross
out
of
the
brightness
of
the
lightning
she
had
received
a
promise
of
a
blessing
still
the
tender
sensitive
heart
was
bleeding
for
its
own
but
tess
had
the
hidden
god
to
help
her
and
the
child
she
sat
watching
him
she
could
see
that
he
was
growing
thinner
growing
more
emaciated
as
the
days
passed
he
could
eat
only
the
food
tess
forced
into
his
mouth
but
the
sugar
rags
kept
him
from
whining
at
this
moment
he
was
eying
the
with
intelligent
intentness
ye
air
the
miserablest
little
devil
i
ever
seed
no
pappy
and
a
mammy
what
air
afraid
to
say
ye
air
hers
i
hated
ye
last
night
but
ye
air
such
a
wrinkled
little
tramp
that
this
mornin
i
promises
ye
to
keep
ye
till
ye
dies
she
was
bending
over
the
babe
watching
every
expression
that
flitted
over
the
drawn
mouth
in
this
position
she
did
not
hear
the
door
open
silently
as
teola
stepped
in
the
minister
daughter
whispered
to
the
crouching
squatter
tessibel
can
can
you
ever
forgive
me
tess
stood
up
and
took
a
long
breath
teola
noted
how
the
night
had
changed
the
brilliant
coloring
to
a
whiteness
that
startled
her
an
agony
of
remorse
broke
over
her
and
dropping
upon
her
knees
she
wept
upon
the
face
of
little
dan
tess
i
nearly
died
all
through
the
night
oh
can
you
forgive
me
i
ai
no
business
to
be
ye
it
be
the
brat
what
ye
air
to
asks
forgiveness
of
teola
sprang
to
her
feet
tess
she
cried
sharply
never
had
the
girl

in
this
light
it
air
hard
on
the
little
kid
tessibel
said
meditatively
when
its
ma
says
what
another
woman
air
it
for
good
and
all
this
remark
came
forth
in
even
tones
teola
had
not
thought
of
the
harm
she
had
done
the
child
of
dan
jordan
by
throwing
the
motherhood
upon
the
squatter
she
turned
her
troubled
eyes
first
upon
tess
then
upon
the
child
tessibel
i
do
love
him
even
if
i
disowned
him

the
scene
that
followed
the
settled
in
a
heap
upon
the
floor
bowed
the
tired
head
and
wept
tessibel
tess
called
teola
touching
the
girl
shoulder

brokenly

tess
elias
graves
beautiful
daughter
sank
on
the
breast
of
the
squatter
and
there
was
a
kiss
of
forgiveness
the
baby
whimpered
teola
drew
away
from
tessibel
with
a
long
sigh
she
reached
for
the
there
ai
none

said
with
a
touch
of
joy
in
her
tones

moaned
teola
oh
tess
i
so
ill
i
wish
i
were
dead
a
tall
boy
had
repeated
the
same
words
the
night
before
tess
drew
herself
up
painfully
she
pitied
teola
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
but
in
spite
of
her
pity
she
could
not
help
the
thrill
of
happiness
when
she
thought
of
frederick
coming
and
knowing
all
it
ai
no
use
to
wish
ye
were
dead
said
she
ye
allers
die
if
ye
wants
to
when
i
thought
daddy
was
to
the
rope
i
say
every
day
i
were
to
die
women
ai
so
easy
she
was
preparing
the
warm
sop
for
the
child
and
taking
him
from
his
mother
arm
she
sat
down
in
the
rocking
chair
she
did
not
speak
again
until
she
had
drained
the
sweetened
water
from
the
and
the
child
had
smacked
it
down
eagerly
suddenly
she
spoke
handing
the
babe
to
teola
ca
ye
put
out
a
drop
more
milk
evenin
i
took
all
there
was
last
night
and
the
night
before
too
and
this
morning
rebecca
was
furious
she
had
to
go
without
milk
in
her
coffee
i
do
know
that
i
can
get
any
the
weather
air
so
cold
now
explained
tess
kennedy
wo
let
his
cows
stay
in
the
fields
nights
i
might
crib
some
more
if
i
could
every
time
i
steals
up
to
yer
house
i
thinks
yer
woman

me
and
yer
pappy
and
mammy

home
teola
nodded
if
yer
pappy
catched
me
swipin
milk
he
knock
the
head
offen
me
i
steals
it
just
the
same
i
air
afraid
of
yer
pappy
though
no
wonder
replied
teola
and
she
lapsed
into
silence
her
father
hated
the
squatter
girl
hated
the
fishermen
who
still
plied
their
unlawful
trade
under
the
noses
of
the
gamekeepers
teola
was
crying
softly
she
felt
it
was
only
just
to
relieve
tess
of
the
stigma
she
had
placed
upon
her
but
to
go
home
and
face
the
proud
young
brother
with
the
story
of
her
sin
with
the
lie
she
had
told
were
almost
unbearable
then
another
thought
pierced
her
could
tess
keep
the
baby
all
winter
and
would
she
herself
have
the
courage
to
live
knowing
that
he
might
sometimes
be
hungry
and
cold
frederick
would
help
her
she
was
glad
she
had
decided
to
tell
him
as
she
walked
up
the
long
hill
she
saw
her
brother
standing
on
the
porch
and
noted
the
pallor
of
his
face
the
expression
of
misery
in
his
eyes
at
first
the
boy
did
not
see
her
not
until
she
called
his
name
softly
teola
sank
upon
the
upper
step
it
takes
away
my
breath
to
climb
that
hill
she
panted
when
she
could
speak
it
grows
harder
and
harder
every
day
i
shall
be
glad
when
we
leave
this
old
cottage
was
the
boy
moody
reply
i
never
knew
how
much
i
hated
the
lake
until
teola
did
not
answer
to
this
for
she
knew
that
she
was
to
blame
for
that
hatred
frederick
was
looking
at
the
hut
under
the
willow
wofully
if
anyone
had
told
me
what
i
saw
last
night
he
blurted
out
a
moment
later
i
believe
i
would
have
killed
him
i
loved
her
teola
now
she
would
tell
him
send
him
back
to
tessibel
with
joy
in
his
heart
she
sprang
up
impetuously
frederick
she
began
quickly
let
me
tell
but
he
interrupted
her
you
need
not
tell
me
that
i
have
to
forgive
her
for
such
a
thing
as
this
because
of
ignorance
it
too
horrible
i
shall
never
get
the
sight
of
that
child
out
of
my
mind
that
streak
of
awful
lurid
red
that
yapping
mouth
those
clawing
hands
god
the
disgust
i
felt
teola
teola
you
are
ill
rebecca
come
here
come
come
together
they
lifted
her
from
the
porch
where
she
had
fallen
like
a
man
stabbed
with
a
knife
gurgling
from
her
lips
poured
the
fresh
red
blood
from
the
diseased
lungs
teola
tried
to
speak
tried
to
tell
frederick
the
truth
but
the
awful
tugging
in
her
chest
and
her
brother
order
that
she
must
not
speak
closed
her
lips
upon
the
good
resolution
added
to
his
command
came
one
from
the
doctor
who
arrived
later
that
she
must
not
speak
one
word
until
he
came
the
next
day
the
hemorrhage
had
been
brought
on
by
frederick
description
of
her
child
after
her
brother
had
gone
she
thought
of
the
hour
when
she
could
tell
him
but
with
a
thankful
feeling
in
her
heart
that
it
had
been
delayed
a
little
time
until
the
great
university
bells
chimed
the
hour
of
midnight
tessibel
waited
in
the
hut
for
frederick
she
hes
forgot
to
tell
him
she
muttered
wearily
pulling
the
sleepy
babe
into
her
arms
and
and
he
ai
chapter
xxxiv
tess
saw
the
minister
family
arrive
in
the
small
lake
steamer
and
saw
frederick
meet
them
at
the
dock
she
was
watching
from
between
the
tatters
of
the
ragged
curtain
and
noted
that
teola
had
not
come
down
the
hill
with
her
brother
this
disturbed
the
squatter
for
the
mother
had
looked
ill
when
she
left
the
day
before
with
the
resolution
to
tell
the
student
her
secret
as
minister
graves
passed
she
saw
frederick
looking
fondly
into
his
father
face
but
he
sent
no
friendly
glance
toward
the
hut
snuggled
under
the
willow
the
watching
girl
saw
that
the
student
face
was
haggard
and
a
thrill
swept
over
her
it
was
because
of
his
love
he
wanted
to
be
with
her
but
he
thought
she
had
been
tess
turned
her
head
from
the
window
blinded
by
tears
but
for
the
child
in
the
box
there
swept
into
her
mind
a
text
she
had
learned
if
ye
have
faith
as
a
grain
of
ye
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
remove
hence
to
yonder
place
and
it
shall
remove
ah
if
she
could
have
such
faith
only
such
a
little
faith
she
could
bring
the
boy
back
bring
back
through
god
goodness
the
student
she
loved
i
air
ye
jesus
she
trembled
i
takes
care
of
the
brat
till
he
croaks
give
me
back
emotion
left
the
prayer
unuttered
in
her
breast
at
eight
that
evening
tess
hugging
the
fence
sneaked
up
through
the
rain
she
turned
into
graves
orchard
scurrying
barefooted
toward
the
house
casting
glances
at
intervals
behind
her
through
the
small
garret
window
she
could
see
rebecca
moving
in
her
room
preparing
to
go
out
the
library
facing
the
lane
was
dark
but
the
streak
of
light
flung
long
upon
the
porch
told
the
squatter
that
the
family
was
in
the
tess
ventured
to
the
back
of
the
house
drawing
near
the
dark
kitchen
here
was
where
teola
had
placed
the
milk
for
several
days
she
scraped
about
in
the
inky
darkness
but
her
fingers
touched
nothing
the
babe
mother
had
forgotten
to
put
out
the
pail
until
the
coming
of
the
dominie
and
his
wife
tess
had
had
but
little
fear
but
now
her
breath
came
spasmodically
there
was
danger
of
detection
if
she
crept
into
the
kitchen
to
obtain
the
milk
if
she
could
only
get
into
kennedy
barn
if
the
cows
were
only
out
to
pasture
tess
turned
the
handle
of
the
kitchen
door
softly
and
stepped
in
a
light
streak
came
from
the
and
she
located
the
through
the
dim
shadows
teola
had
told
her
to
take
the
milk
from
there
if
she
failed
to
find
it
outside
she
advanced
slowly
into
the
kitchen
holding
her
breath
but
her
heart
thumped
so
loudly
that
she
feared
the
family
would
hear
it
kneeling
down
at
the
refrigerator
she
fumbled
for
the
lock
the
door
slid
open
silently
a
small
pail
of
milk
stood
behind
the
and
tessibel
clutching
it
in
her
fingers
rose
up
as
she
did
so
a
light
flashed
into
her
face
and
she
looked
up
to
find
dominie
graves
towering
over
her
his
brows
caught
together
with
anger
so
miss
skinner
is
the
thief
who
takes
our
milk
the
girl
ah

is

tessibel
dropped
her
eyes
still
holding
the
can
of
milk

said

her
gaze

dominie
stepped
to
the
kitchen
door
leading
into
the
yard
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
he
placed
the
lamp
on
the
table
the
squatter
waiting
with
eyes
for
a
long
time
went
on
the
dominie
in
slow
measured
tones

have
thought
it

a
good
thing

sound

the
rod
and
spoil
the
child

father

to
do
miss
skinner
the
sneer
in
his
voice
and
his
slur
on
her
father
brought
a
bright
flush
of
anger
to
tessibel
face
ye
can
cowhide
me
if
ye
wants
to
but
do
say
nothin
against

whitened
she
had
not
believed
the
minister
when
he
had
threatened
to
whip
her
he
was
trying
to
scare
her
he
would
probably
take
away
the
milk
and
send
her
home
again
but
he
had
stepped
to
the
wall
and
taken
a
from
a
nail
tess
had
seen
that
whip
before
once
the
time
she
had
twiggled
her
fingers
graves
had
shaken
it
at
her
from
his
then
she
had
not
been
afraid
the
clergyman
came
toward
her
ye
hit
me
with
that
whip
growled
tess
and
and
i
kill
ye
oh
you
will
eh
well
then
there
it
is
a
stinging
blow
fell
across
her
shoulders
and
another
and
another
the
slender
body
writhed
silently
turned
and
twisted
to
escape
the
descending
whip
drops
of
milk
spattered
upon
the
floor
never
before
had
tess
known
such
physical
pain
the
minister
was
counting
the
blows
deliberately
as
they
fell
at
the
eighth
stroke
the
girl
opened
her
lips
and
uttered
a
long
piercing
cry
an
intense
vibrating
cry
the
last
blow
fell
upon
tessibel
shivering
back
and
frederick
appeared
in
the
doorway
his
father
leaning
against
the
wall
breathlessly
the
whip
hanging
limply
from
his
hand
tessibel
skinner
barefooted
and
weeping
with
a
pail
of
milk
clasped
in
her
fingers
was
what
the
boy
saw
he
had
no
chance
to
speak
before
teola
too
with
streaming
hair
her
nightrobe
clutched
convulsively
in
one
hand
opened
the
hall
door
the
scene
whirled
before
her
like
a
frightful
nightmare
the
turned
and
faced
her
yer
pappy
air
me
i
hev
stealin
milk
her
words
fell
between
little
broken
gasps
they
touched
frederick
as
he
never
had
been
touched
before
he
stepped
forward
hastily
to
speak
i
air
the
milk
she
explained
bowing
her
head
before
him
i
has
to
have
it
the
infant
rushed
into
frederick
mind
the
squalid
cabin
that
twisting
thing
with
thin
discolored
veins
it
had
been
for
him
that
tess
had
stolen
teola
staggered
toward
her
father
a
cough
racking
the
emaciated
frame
minister
graves
threw
his
arms
about
her
go

quickly
child

that
milk
and
if
i
find
you
here
in
the
future
i
shall
put
you
behind
the
bars
with
your
father
frederick
counted
the
beats
of
his
heart
through
the
blank
silence
he
felt
impelled
to
reach
forward
to
tessibel
to
say
something
to
relieve
the
white
tense
face
his
father
was
waiting
for
the
squatter
to
take
her
departure
but
tess
remained
with
the
pail
in
her
hand
suddenly
she
lifted
her
streaming
eyes
to
the
minister
face
i
has
been
beaten
and
i
air
so
bad
air
i
to
have
the
milk
i
needs
it
tess
sobbed
again
and
continued
i
ai
so
awful
about
the
lickin
as
i
does
about
havin
the
milk
she
came
forward
close
to
him
with
searching
sweetness
in
her
gaze
the
dominie
drew
back
fearing
the
soiled
dress
would
touch
him
the
girl
was
making
the
appeal
to
him
alone
and
a
cloud
of
color
gathered
slowly
over
his
face
under
her
steady
eyes
he
regained
himself
and
replied
no
you
ca
have
the
milk
no
matter
how
much
you
may
need
it
some
one
die
without
it
she
entreated
again
lowering
her
voice
throwing
no
glance
at
the
silent
boy
or
shivering
girl
then
let
them
die
retorted
the
clergyman
i
do
not
believe
you
anyway
he
was
weakening
a
little
the
attitude
of
his
son
and
daughter
striking
him
almost
to
consent
frederick
eyes
were
filled
with
hauteur
unusual
to
the
boy
and
teola
was
clinging
to
his
neck
weeping
wildly
the
children
had
never
approved
of
his
persecution
of
the
squatters
but
both
of
them
could
see
that
the
girl
had
been
caught
in
theft
father
teola
implored
give
the
girl
the
milk
she
says
she
needs
it
yes
father
interrupted
frederick
give
it
to
her
she
steal
again
you
wo
will
you
girl
this
was
the
first
word
to
her
since
that
night
he
had
lost
faith
in
her
his
voice
seemed
harsh
it
fell
upon
her
numbing
her
senses
her
body
went
cold
as
if
a
frosty
gust
had
struck
it
you
wo
steal
again
ever
will
you
demanded
he
tessibel
struggled
to
speak
at
last
there
came
a
fluttered
confession
which
made
teola
graves
shiver
like
an
aspen
leaf
if
she
could
only
summon
courage
to
tell
her
arrogant
father
the
truth
she
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
her
squatter
friend
nor
upon
frederick
white
face
i
has
to
steal
said
tess
i
has
to
have
the
milk
i
ca
get
it
no
way
else
there
there
exclaimed
the
dominie
with
a
derisive
laugh
if
that
is
depravity
i
do
know
what
is
now
then
miss
put
down
that
pail
and
go
he
strode
forward
and
grasped
the
handle
in
his
fingers
but
tess
held
it
firmly
her
mind
flashed
to
the
child
in
the
hut
smacking
fiercely
through
the
long
night
she
thought
of
the
morning
of
the
hungry
gray
eyes
and
the
ceaseless
baby
whimper
and
defied
the
minister
i
air
to
have
it
she
insisted
take
yer
hand
offen
that
handle
graves
gasped
for
breath
but
did
not
relax
his
hold
upon
the
pail
with
a
motion
as
quick
as
lightning
flashes
tess
lowered
her
head
and
set
her
teeth
into
the
dominie
fat
white
hand
a
cry
of
pain
escaped
him
and
he
opened
his
fingers
i
said
as
how
i
got
to
have
the
milk
and
and
i
air
got
it
open
that
door
tess
shrieked
out
the
last
words
her
eyes
full
of
hatred
bent
upon
graves
frederick
strode
forward
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
tess
sprang
out
tessibel
ran
swiftly
through
the
orchard
out
into
the
lane
her
rage
dying
out
in
her
fear
for
the
babe
she
had
never
left
him
so
long
before
her
flesh
still
tingled
from
the
dominie
blows
but
her
admission
before
frederick
that
she
was
compelled
to
steal
hurt
her
worse
than
the
blue
welts
rising
upon
her
shoulders
she
regretted
too
that
she
had
bitten
the
clergyman
hand
but
that
had
been
done
for
the
baby
little
dan
had
to
live
she
came
to
an
alert
standstill
in
front
of
the
cabin
she
saw
the
light
from
a
candle
flickering
out
through
the
window
tess
was
sure
she
had
left
the
hut
dark
she
had
extinguished
the
light
just
before
going
out
for
the
milk
who
was
in
the
hut
or
had
she
made
a
mistake
and
left
the
candle
there
for
the
sake
of
the
child
she
had
to
enter
she
set
down
the
pail
lifted
her
skirt
wiped
away
the
traces
of
tears
then
flinging
wide
the
door

came

standing
beside
the
bed
with
the
open
in
his
hand
looking
down
intently
upon
the
child
his
one
eye
flashed
past
tess
in
its
blindness
while
the
watery
one
with
the
red
veins
running
through
it
distorted
itself
into
a
squint
and
brought
its
evil
gaze
upon
her
the
fat
chin
covered
with
a
stubby
growth
of
hair

with
malicious
pleasure

grimly
through

screech
of
a
die

in
smothered
laughter
the
scraping
of
the
willow
on
the
tin
roof

dimly
to
her
in
the
silence
if
some

squatter

only
come
along

always
saved
her
from

gone
completely
from

a
desperate
wish
came
to
escape
the
man
who
had
constantly
thrown
his
menacing
shadow
across
the
path
of
her
life
suddenly
her
bosom
heaved
a
verse
was
thrown
into
her
mind
tess
opened
her
lips
and
muttered
keeping
her
eyes
upon
the
fisherman
if
ye
have
faith
as
the
grain
of
ye
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
the
time
between

present
and
that
night
the
student
had
left
her
in
bitter
sorrow
faded
in
her
imagination
she
was
alone
in
the
rain
with
the
child
upon
her
hands
offering
it
up
to
the
dark
god
for
a
blessing
the

uplifting

upon
her

crucified

protect

for

a
a
mighty
little
thing
ai
it
ben
letts
tess
stood
up
looking
beyond
him
like
one
in
a
dream
yep
grunted
the
fisherman
staring
he
had
never
understood
the
moods
of
tess
she
was
as
incomprehensible
to
him
as
the
myriads
of
stars
that
strung
themselves
through
the
sky
but
his
inability
to
understand
her
made
him
desire
the
girl
the
more
he
had
come
at
an
hour
when
he
was
sure
tess
would
be
alone
he
would
force
her
to
come
to
his
cabin
to
marry
him
even
before
her
father
was
hanged
ben
eyes
settled
again
upon
the
basket
through
his
heavy
senses
sifted
a
wave
of
hatred
for
the
miserable
child
whining
for
the
milk
tess
had
stolen
ben
moved
his
great
feet
tearing
up
a
long
splinter
from
a
broken
board
with
his
heel
it
startled
tess
from
her
reverie
in
upon
her
faith
came
the
sickening
thought
of
frederick
his
confidence
in
her
blasted
and
gone
it
choked
a
prayer
that
lingered
upon
her
lips
ben
rose
to
his
feet
an
oath
belching
from
his
ugly
mouth
put
down
that
basket
put
it
down
i
says
never
had
it
entered
her
mind
before
to
conciliate
the
fisherman
who
had
pestered
her
with
his
attentions
but
her
frightened
womanhood
caught
at
the
idea

till
i
gives
him
somethin
to
eat

stolidly
if

someone

down
and
watched

narrowly

grown
so
beautiful
in
the
last
few
months
that
the
brute
force
in
the
man
rose
in
his
desire
to
possess
her
there
was
one
way
to
bring
the
girl
on
her
knees
to
him
one
way
to
bow
the
proud
red
head
the
little
child
made
no
difference
to
him
and
some
day
he
would
get
even
with
the
student
too
the
small
bare
feet
of
the
squatter
girl
noiselessly
plied
their
way
from
the
smoking
stove
to
the
thence
to
the
basket
tess
held
the
warm
sweet
milk
to
the
infant
lips
lifting
the
withered
chin
that
the
child
might
drink
the
better
her
mind
was
working
rapidly
how
should
she
escape
and
rescue
the
babe
she
went
back
for
more
milk
wetting
the
corner
of
the
cloth
and
wiping
little
face
then
she
gazed
straight
at
ben
letts
and
said
how
air
yer
mammy
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
that
she
should
ask
this
of
him
she
air
well
answered
ben
thrown
off
his
guard
he
took
out
his
pipe
and
continued
when

replied
whispering
a
prayer
for
aid
what
be

goin
to
do
with

i
do
know
yet
a
muttered
petition
fell
over
the
baby
face
but
she
said
aloud
i
think
it

to
croak
i
so
too
ben
said
thoughtfully
he

answered
slowly

and

shivered
she
remembered
myra
broken
wrist
and
heard
again
the
woful
cry
from
the
other
squatter
girl
as
she
told
of
the
harm
done
her
if
she
could
get
out
of
the
shanty
she
could
run
from
him
but
that
would
leave
the
child
to
his
mercy
she
glanced
toward
the
door
whatever
came
to
her
she
must
protect
the
babe
lifting
him
from
his
bed
she
sat
down
at
the
oven
and
extended
the
blue
legs
toward
the
heat
he
air
so
damn
thin
she
said
in
excuse

had
intimated
that
the
baby
was
hers
i
ai
tellin
daddy
nothin
his
troubles
be
enough
for
her
tone
was
low
and
bitter
she
turned
the
babe
with
its
back
to
the
heat
to
gain
time
she
had
almost
decided
to
run
away
she
could
not
face
myra
fate
this
durn
stove
ai
got
no
fire
in
it
she
said
laying
baby
dan
in
the
box
i
for
a
stick
of
wood
as
tessibel
walked
past
him
ben
did
not
stop
her
squatters
never
saved
steps
for
their
women
the
girl
flung
open
the
door
but
hesitated
on
the
threshold
during
the
instant
of
her
indecision
a
silent
panorama
of
night
passed
before
her
heavy
rain
clouds
dipped
almost
to
the
dark
water
obscuring
the
city
and
the
university
hill
beyond
a
great
steamer
attached
to
a
number
of
canal
boats
lay
as
a
thin
black
line
in
the
center
of
the
lake
an
owl
left
the
branches
of
the
hut
tree
and
circled
into
the
safety
of
the
shore
willows
and
a
stealthy
barn
cat
with
legs
crept
from
the
water
edge
toward
the
lane
with
a
trailing
dead
fish
in
his
jaws
he
turned
glistening
green
eyes
upon
tess
and
leapt
away
with
his
treasure
oh
to
be
out
once
more
in
the
darkness
with
the
child
out
among
creatures
her
creatures
there
she
would
be
safe
safe
from
terror
glancing
back
at
little
dan
she
saw
his
large
gray
eyes
fixed
gravely
upon
the
candlelight
to
leave
him
there
was
like
sending
him
into
the
jaws
of
death
to
take
him
was
impossible
she
turned
back
closed
the
door
with
a
gasp
and
faced
ben
letts
he
was
at
her
side
in
a
moment
i
air
got
ye
now
sounded
in
her
ear
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
she
felt
the
man
crush
her
in
his
arms
felt
the
thick
lips
upon
her
face
ye
think
ye
be
such
a
smart
kid
that
ye
need
never
mind
what
a

tried
to

her
breath
beneath
the
tightening
grasp
the
door
burst
open
and
frederick
graves
received
a
desperate
look
of
entreaty
from
the
chapter
xxxvi
the
babe
smacked
loudly
the
september
wind
whirled
its
rain
and
dead
willow
leaves
over
the
hut
floor
a
rasping
sound
like
the
filing
of
a
saw
came
from
the
tin
roof
frederick
graves
took
in
the
scene
with
one
sharp
glance
he
saw
the
fisherman
in
ugly
doggedness
towering
over
the
small
figure
of
the
then
he
flung
himself
upon
ben
letts
he
tore
fingers
from
tessibel
neck
leaving
the
skin
reddened
and
scratched
by
the
nails
tess
sank
to
the
floor
the
student
fist
came
down
with
a
stunning
blow
upon
the
partly
upturned
face
of
the
squatter
ben
and
the
fellow
tumbled
over
stand
up
said
frederick
to
tessibel
lifting
her
gently
to
her
feet
her
hand
fluttered
to
her
eyes
then
to
her
throat
still
dizzy
from
the
choking
she
sank
into
the
what
were
you
two
fighting
over
demanded
frederick
impetuously
tess
gathered
her
senses
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
he
were
to
make
me
come
to
his
shanty
with
him
to
be
and
i
ai
she
whimpered
a
little
but
choked
back
the
tears
and
raged
a
ca
live
a
minute
without
some
damn
bloke
wants
to
take
her
from
her
daddy
shanty
i
ai
i
says
how
brave
she
felt
with
the
student
near
for
there
was
an
expression
upon
his
face
that
gave
her
courage
he
looked
so
strong
so
brave
and
he
had
come
when
she
had
prayed
something
took
from
her
the
terror
of
the
night
when
she
had
proclaimed
her
motherhood
to
him
perhaps
teola
had
told
him
the
truth
when
he
had
turned
from
her
in
the
agony
of
the
confession
he
had
scorned
her
with
his
proud
dark
eyes
now
he
threw
her
the
same
protective
glance
that
she
had
received
before
the
tragedy
the
silence
in
the
room
became
oppressive
i
ai
she
said
again
to
break
it
ben

upon
the
floor
he
feared
to
rise
for

threateningly
over
him
she
goes
to
my
shanty
insisted
ben
screwing
his
face
to
peep
through
the
swollen
lids
she
and
the
brat
goes
to
my
hut
i
air
its
pappy
frederick
staggered
back
against
the
door
with
a
groan
tess
catching
her
breath
in
a
sob
she
could
not
exonerate
herself
because
of
teola
she
knew
from
frederick
emotion
at
ben
assertion
that
his
sister
had
not
told
him
but
he
should
not
believe
the
lie
that
letts
had
uttered
she
saw
the
fine
face
of
the
student
fall
into
his
hands
and
shudder
after
shudder
run
over
the
giant
frame
ben
letts
leered
at
him
with
his
twisted
face
as
a
demon
might
at
a
soul
in
torment
the
boy
suffered
for
her
that
was
enough
the
front
portion
of
her
skirt
had
been
almost
torn
away
in
her
struggle
and
unconsciously
she
lifted
it
and
pinned
a
thorn
more
closely
in
its
place
but
for
an
instant
she
held
back
the
words
ready
upon
her
tongue
and
with
one
long
step
she
reached
frederick
placing
her
hand
upon
his
arm
do
touch
me
please
he
shuddered
it
awful
awful
and
i
i
loved
you
so
haw
chuckled
ben
settling
back
against
the
child
box
i
says
as
how
the
gal
comes
to
my
shanty
she
brings
the
brat
to
its
frederick
moodily
considered
the
ugly
face
the
sneer
that
accompanied
the
declaration
roused
his
rage
the
brute
had
sealed
the
doom
of
tessibel
skinner
again
the
student
was
oblivious
of
his
love
for
the
profession
he
had
chosen
forgot
that
the
one
book
he
had
studied
more
than
any
other
taught
him
that
the
god
he
worshiped
would
avenge
all
wrong
in
one
step
he
was
upon
the
fisherman
he
lifted
orn
stool
and
brought
it
down
with
a
crash
upon
ben
head
tess
uttered
a
sharp
frightened
cry
speeding
to
interrupt
another
blow
get
out
of
the
way
cried
the
student
pushing
her
from
him
i
am
going
to
kill
him
with
no
ungentle
touch
she
grasped
frederick
arm
holding
the
stool
in
the
air
ye
air
to
wait
she
said
in
low
swift
tones
her
gaze
dominating
his
flashing
eyes
ye
kill
him
if
ye
hit
him
again
wait
till
i
says
what
i
to
i
loves
my
daddy
that
ye
knows
anything
in
the
hull
world
god
better
than
the
child
demanded
frederick
placing
his
foot
upon
ben
a
grunt
issued
from
the
girl
lips
yep
a
hundred
times
better
than
the
brat
and
i
says
this
that
i
hopes
my
daddy
neck
be
twisted
by
the
rope
i
hopes
that
i
never
sees
him
again
her
voice
was
raised
high
above
the
whistling
wind
and
dashing
rain
i
hopes
she
finished
that
his
soul
shrivel
in
hell
stop
stop
muttered
frederick
why
are
you
saying
such
things
i
hopes
it
all
insisted
tess
bending
her
head
nearer
and
i
swears
that
i
hopes
it
if
ben
letts
ai
a
liar
frederick
foot
slipped
from
the
round
fat
body
he
took
a
long
breath
brushing
a
damp
lock
from
his
brow
i
believe
you
he
surrendered
slowly
oh
god
tessibel
i
believe
you
and
i
love
you
in
spite
of
that
his
glance
swept
over
ben
prostrate
body
to
the
child
letts
sat
up
with
an
oath
rubbing
the
inflicted
bruises
frederick
helped
him
to
his
feet
you
go
home
he
said
piercing
the
fisherman
with
his
burning
eyes
and
let
me
warn
you
against
fastening
any
of
your
lies
upon
this
girl
for
whatever
she
is
or
whatever
she
has
done
i
know
that
you
lied
now
go
frederick
pointed
toward
the
door
letts
muttering
threats
and
curses
against
the
student
and
the
stumbled
out
into
the
storm
ben
head
was
splitting
with
pain
a
gash
on
his
nose
bled
until
his
torn
sleeve
was
thickened
with
blood
he
staggered
out
of
the
rays
of
the
candle
and
took
the
path
to
the
hill
the
sound
of
footsteps
caused
him
to
sink
down
beside
the
way
and
wait
was
the
student
no
the
person
was
coming
from
the
other
direction
in
the
dim
light
he
saw
a
man
dripping
with
water
totter
toward
him
ben
peered
out
upon
the
wobbling
legs
and
in
another
instant
had
fallen
back
shivering
with
fright
and
superstitious
fear
ezra
longman
his
face
haggard
and
ghastly
white
stood
directly
in
front
of
him
frederick
closed
the
door
upon
ben
and
tess
turned
upon
him
sharply
it
were
a
lie
he
told
ye
said
she
and
he
were
worth
killin
i
do
want
to
speak
of
him
stammered
frederick
i
came
to
talk
to
you
it
nearly
killed
me
when
my
father
whipped
you
and
i
want
to
save
you
from
such
things
in
the
future
my
father
gives
me
an
allowance
i
want
to
buy
the
milk
for
the
little
child
will
you
let
me
tess
his
face
had
grown
scarlet
his
eyes
fell
before
hers
the
girl
seemed
glued
to
the
spot
it
will
save
you
from
stealing
resumed
the
boy
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
steal
the
tragic
tone
stung
tessibel
teola
had
promised
to
tell
him
she
herself
would
it
was
only
right
that
he
should
know
she
took
two
impetuous
steps
forward
opened
her
lips
but
again
remembered
her
oath
i
air
ye
for
the
milk
was
all
she
said
with
an
embarrassed
air
frederick
tendered
her
a
silver
dollar
tessibel
stepped
back
hesitant
it
will
make
me
happier
if
you
will
take
it
he
urged
tess
extended
her
fingers
blushing
crimson
but
took
the
coin
from
his
hand
a
sob
choked
the
utterance
of
further
gratitude
professor
young
says
broke
in
frederick
after
a
painful
silence
that
he
is
going
to
bring
your
father
back
here
before
the
winter
but
tess
i
do
want
you
to
live
in
this
shanty
i
want
you
to
be
a
better
girl
tess
will
you
will
you
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
child
the
darkness
of
the
night
the
ghostly
sound
of
the
wind
the
swish
of
the
thousands
of
wet
leaves
over
the
roof
roused
the
romance
in
the
girl
until
she
felt
an
impulse
to
tell
him
the
whole
painful
story
to
feel
his
kisses
warm
upon
her
face
to
have
his
arms
about
her
to
kneel
with
him
again
and
hear
his
earnest
voice
interceding
for
daddy
skinner
but
her
oath
it
was
secret
not
hers
ye
could
go
on
me
the
same
as
before
ye
knowed
of
him
her
head
inclined
toward
the
infant
in
a
question
frederick
shook
his
head
no
he
ejaculated
no
nevertheless
i
would
save
you
from
worse
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
believe
that
you
were
honest
in
your
desire
to
know
god
and
the
truth
he
will
forgive
you
your
sin
tessibel
if
you
ask
him
if
god
air
forgivin
then
could
ye
forgive
too
it
took
a
desperate
effort
to
utter
the
words
nothing
but
her
love
for
him
could
have
forced
them
from
her
that
different
reddened
the
boy
i
wanted
i
wanted
to
marry
you
some
day
to
marry
her
she
drew
a
great
heaving
breath
more
strongly
tempted
to
tell
him
than
before
but
as
she
struggled
with
her
desire
her
face
grew
paler
and
the
drooping
mouth
gathered
sad
lines
she
did
not
reply
and
the
student
continued
you
have
one
of
the
most
beautiful
voices
i
have
ever
heard
tess
it
is
a
gift
and
he
will
hold
you
responsible
for
it
if
you
neglect
it
i
air
only
a
squatter
she
moaned
forlornly
shaking
the
red
curls
daddy
air
a
squatter
too
and
if
he
air
home
then
i
stays
with
him
if
he
says
as
how
we
stay
in
the
shanty
then
we
stays
even
if
it
air
yer
daddy
i
asks
daddy
skinner
to
give
it
back
but
a
brat
ca
boss
her
pappy
can
she
ye
sees
do
ye
yes
tess
i
see
slowly
replied
frederick
but
it
not
because
of
my
father
i
want
you
to
go
you
have
the
squatter
rights
and
may
remain
if
you
wish
it
is
for
your
own
sake
you
are
sixteen
but
of
course
the
child
has
changed
your
life
it
ai
changed
my
lovin
you
this
was
the
first
open
confession
of
her
love
she
made
it
emphatically
almost
sullenly
frederick
whitened
and
turned
his
face
away
in
the
terror
of
the
thought
that
she
would
lose
him
again
tess
sank
upon
her
knees
beside
him
this
time
he
did
not
thrust
her
aside
the
strong
young
hands
pressed
upon
his
shoulders
and
the
sensitive
chin
trembled
tess
turned
her
face
up
to
his
do
he
breathed
hard
do
tess
but
the
girl
heeded
him
not
of
a
sudden
frederick
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
directly
into
hers
the
jealousy
that
had
risen
in
his
breast
forcing
him
from
her
and
demanding
that
he
should
never
look
upon
her
face
again
yielded
precedence
to
a
nobler
and
stronger
thought
he
would
help
the
girl
with
her
living
secret
help
her
and
make
her
better
long
and
fixedly
he
studied
the
beautiful
face
until
he
had
read
to
the
finish
the
tale
of
passion
and
longing
the
auburn
head
bent
nearer
and
nearer
the
panting
lips
imparting
the
sweet
breath
of
youth
then
they
both
forgot
the
whistling
wind
and
the
falling
rain
forgot
even
the
wriggling
babe
in
its
bed
frederick
lips
closed
down
upon
the
girl
and
the
dark
hair
of
the
student
mingled
with
the
red
curls
of
the
squatter
i
shall
never
let
you
go
again
murmured
frederick
his
lips
roving
in
sweet
freedom
over
the
flushed
cheeks
and
i
ai
ter
let
yer
go
nuther
whispered
tess
i
works
fishes
and
berries
the
years
through
but
i
air
yer
squatter
the
child
as
if
in
pain
cried
sharply
the
student
arms
slipped
limply
from
tessibel
and
he
stood
up
i
had
forgotten
it
for
a
moment
tess
the
infant
has
changed
your
life
and
mine
i
have
loved
you
dearly
i
love
you
still
but
the
child
is
between
us
and
always
will
be
i
must
remember
it
ah
i
have
forgotten
one
thing
i
came
for
here
he
was
holding
a
small
bible
out
to
her
in
my
temper
i
burned
yours
i
sorry
i
was
bringing
you
this
when
i
heard
you
cry
tess
took
the
book
in
her
hand
mechanically
and
the
hope
rekindled
in
her
heart
died
frederick
bent
over
her
for
one
short
moment
looking
into
her
eyes
forgive
me
if
you
can
tess
and
and
be
a
good
girl
he
opened
the
door
and
was
gone
before
she
could
stop
him
with
chattering
teeth
she
flung
herself
upon
the
stool
resting
her
head
in
her
arms
on
the
table
heeding
not
the
second
whining
command
from
the
infant
suddenly
with
flashing
eyes
she
bounded
up
she
would
tell
him
teola
had
promised
that
he
should
know
why
not
be
happy
and
make
him
happy
she
would
call
him
back
and
the
door
opened
under
her
impulsive
hand
she
faced
the
storm
and
the
tall
gaunt
emaciated
form
of
ezra
longman
chapter
xxxvii
ezra
looked
so
like
a
wandering
so
tall
wet
and
thin
that
tess
uttered
a
shriek
the
lad
pushed
his
way
into
the
cabin
and
dropped
on
the
floor
all
thought
of
the
student
was
driven
from
tessibel
mind
by
her
superstition
at
the
sight
of
the
boy
ezy

his
head
toward
the
infant

air
the

as

he
said
slowly
but
before
he
could
say
another
word
the
girl
interposed
hastily

brat

to
a
woman

the
hill

for

to

loved

tess
able
to
deny
the
motherhood
that
had
been
thrust
upon
her
to
the
student
she
stood
condemned
of
a
sin
he
could
not
forgive
but
to

totteringly
and
tessibel
with
a
tender
expression
in
her
eyes
opened
the
door

and
ezra
stumbled
away
tess
watched

stagger
along
the
shore
through
the
rain
the
shadows
of
the
trees
at
last
swallowing
him
up
she
turned
back
into
the
hut

the
door
and
fed
the
child
with
sweetened
milk
forcing
particles
of
bread
into
the
yawning
throat
teola
had
sent
the
student
from
her
never
to
return
yet
she
fed
the
child
tenderly
tucking
it
with
its
sugar
rag
in
the
warm
blanket
she
snuffed
the
end
from
the
candle
that
it
might
burn
brighter

the
little
bible
and
sat
down
to
read
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
death
she
haltingly
spelled
her
eyes
sought
the
small
outline
of
dan
jordan
babe
in
the
bed
she
hardly
understood
paul
figurative
words
but
vaguely
imagined
that
the
apostle
was
afflicted
with
something
like
the
wizened
child
which
had
been
thrust
upon
herself
loud
impatient
noises
issued
from
the
blanket
tess
rose
settled
the
baby
more
comfortably
and
sat
down
again
her
eyes
sought
another
verse
if
ye
have
the
faith
of
a
grain
of
the
passage
brought
a
vivid
blush
to
her
face
she
rose
silently
and
knelt
by
the
window
take
this
here
body
of
my
death
she
prayed
and
give
the
poor
brat
to
the
christ
make
its
ma
tell
the
student
and
give
tessibel
faith
like
a
thus
ended
her
prayer
ezra
longman
sick
unto
death
as
he
had
said
floundered
his
way
along
the
wet
path
the
long
walk
through
the
storm
from
ithaca
had
so
weakened
him
that
he
could
hardly
stand
upright
he
wanted
to
see
his
mother
once
more
to
be
with
satisfied
and
to
warn
myra
of
the
coming
evil
a
conversation
he
had
heard
between
the
nurse
and
professor
young
had
decided
him
to
go
home
if
he
could
for
ezra
knew
that
his
sister
loved
the
ugly
fisherman
who
had
tried
to
put
him
to
death
in
the
hoghole
as
he
neared
his
cabin
home
he
saw
the
candle
streaming
its
flickering
ray
upon
the
path
that
led
to
the
rocks
he
saw
his
mother
snuff
the
flame
and
satisfied
take
myra
child
up
from
the
floor
but
he
did
not
see
his
sister
as
if
in
answer
to
this
thought
as
to
her
whereabouts
myra
appeared
directly
in
front
of
him
carrying
a
pail
of
water
from
the
spring
she
did
not
notice
him
until
he
pronounced
her
name
in
an
undertone
the
pail
dropped
from
her
hand
splashing
its
contents
over
her
garments
and
she
uttered
a
little
frightened
cry
he
whispered
her
name
again
and

timidly
put

for

a
change
gradually
came
over
myra
cunning
grew
in
the
faded
eyes
and
determination
straightened
the
thin
shoulders
as
she
led
her
brother
into
the
hut
mammy
she
called
softly
opening
the
door
here
air
ezy
fetch

in
cried
satisfied
longman
sank
weakly
into
a
chair
the
sight
of
her
son
her
only
son
white
and
emaciated
and
the
appearance
of
the
livid
scar
on
his
brow
drew
a
painful
cry
from
her
lips
he
air
sick
continued
myra
put
him
to
bed
where
air
ye
been
all
this
time
ezy
asked
longman
assisting
him
into
the
small
back
room
but
ezra
was
too
ill
to
tell
the
story
and
the
mother
hushed
him
to
sleep
just
as
she
had
in
those
childhood
days
when
he
had
been
good
and
always
at
home
meantime
myra
pale
and
thoughtful
moved
about
the
shanty
her
mind
was
upon
one
subject
she
must
save
ben
letts
from
the
dreaded
rope
she
did
not
question
the
verity
of
her
brother
statement
for
she
realized
that
ben
was
not
only
capable
of
killing
the
inspector
but
also
of
placing
the
guilt
upon
an
innocent
man
it
did
not
however
change
her
squatter
love
the
more
she
thought
of
ben
danger
the
more
she
loved
and
wanted
to
save
him
the
more
determined
she
grew
to
take
him
away
to
some
place
where
the
officers
could
not
find
him
goin
to
bed
myry
asked
longman
taking
the
candle
and
climbing
the
ladder
to
the
loft
yep
but
i
air
to
rock
the
brat
a
little
while
ye
and
mammy
go
to
bed
i
locks
the
door
she
settled
herself
in
the
wooden
trundling
the
child
to
and
fro
and
murmuring
a
doleful
tune
her
son
was
now
almost
two
years
old
and
beginning
to
toddle
about
upon
a
pair
of
crooked
thin
legs
as
often
as
ben
had
visited
the
hut
he
had
never
deigned
to
look
at
the
child
but
myra
had
a
dull
hope
that
if
she
saved
the
fisherman
he
would
show
some
affection
for
the
little
boy
an
hour
later
the
regular
breathing
of
her
father
and
mother
told
myra
that
they
both
slept
ezra
too
was
sleeping
for
she
had
bent
over
him
but
a
little
time
before
the
clock
on
the
mantel
pointed
to
midnight
the
girl
rose
and
fed
the
baby
dropping
some
paregoric
into
his
milk
to
keep
him
asleep
and
then
drew
a
large
shawl
about
the
little
one
rolling
him
gently
in
the
warm
folds
finally
she
took
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
from
the
shelf
mammy
she
wrote
i
to
save
ben
letts
ezy

werent
orn
skinner

brat
cause

bens
i
luves

and
satisfied
she
pinned
the
note
to
the
handle
of
the
copper
kettle
upon
the
stove
and
lifting
the
child
in
her
arms
slipped
through
the
door
without
a
sound
the
rain
still
fell
steadily
the
turbulent
roll
of
the
lake
lost
only
in
thunder
roar
once
on
the
ragged
rocks
myra
walked
swiftly
afraid
of
the
shadowy
objects
and
ghostly
sounds
that
spectered
her
path
she
threw
despairing
glances
about
her
and
shrank
from
the
imaginary
sneaking
figures
haunting
the
dismal
night
almost
running
she
reached
the
letts
shanty
how
soon
would
the
officers
come
for
ben
they
might
have
been
there
before
her
the
cabin
was
dark
and
she
tapped
timidly
upon
the
kitchen
door
only
a
great
snore
from
the
sleeping
ben
inside
answered
her
trying
the
latch
it
lifted
in
her
fingers
and
she
crept
stealthily
through
the
narrow
aperture
encircling
the
child
with
her
left
arm
ben
she
whispered
ben
the
squatter
turned
muttering
sleepily
mammy
what
be
the
matter

the
fresh
night
air
startled
him
who

he
demanded
hoarsely

the
words
soaked
slowly
into
the
sluggish
brain
tired
from
the
beating
frederick
had
given
him
and
lazy
by
temperament
ben
did
not
at
first
realize
that
myra
message
meant

on
in
a

the
great
squatter
boots
quickly
covered
the
horny
feet
and
trembling
ben
waited
for
myra
to
lead
him
from

asked
in

whisper

by
this
time
they
were
nearing
the
shore
the
autumn
lightning
shot
out
from
the
sky
veering
to
the
north
and
unmasking
the
black
raging
lake
and
the
distant
city
a
heavy
roll
of
thunder
followed
the
flash
the
man
and

did
not
speak
until
the
flat
boat
topped
the
breaking
waves

he
did
not
answer
to
this
nor
did
he
ask
a
question
then
about
the
return
of
ezra
he
was
satisfied
that
what
he
had
supposed
was
the
wraith
the
disembodied
spirit
of
the
lad
he
had
thrown
into
the
hoghole

the
living
ezra
longman

his
way
home
from
the
skinner
hut
ben
had
planned
a
terrible
revenge
upon
the
student
and
tessibel
but
the
advent
of
this
unforeseen
discovery
had
placed
his
enemies
beyond
his
reach
the
thought
of
tess
brought
a
rasp
from
his
throat
the
creaking
oars
under
his
experienced
fingers
carried
the
boat
far
from
the
shadowy
shore
through
the
frequent
lightning
he
could
plainly
see
myra
in
the
stern
holding
to
the
child
it
was
all
ending
differently
from
what
he
had
hoped
that
he
had
killed
the
gamekeeper
he
knew
well
but
when
ezra
longman
had
disappeared
into
the
hoghole
ben
thought
it
took
from
the
earth
the
only
witness
of
his
deed
on
and
on
through
the
night
sped
the
boat
until
myra
and
ben
could
see
the
lights
on
the
college
hill
here
and
there
in
the
valley
beyond
the
lightning
revealed
a
farmhouse
the
inmates
of
which
were
quietly
sleeping
presently
ben
spoke
what
hes
ezy
been
nothin
but
that
ye
throwed
him
in

voices

above

shrieking
of

wind

last
words
were
screamed
out
the
boat
tossed
like
a
bit
of
tinder
but
it
was
in
the
hands
of
a
fisherman

how
to
keep
it
in
and
out
of
the
troughs
of
the

the

lurched
mightily

to

of

stopped
rowing
and

over
the

the

whistle
over

she
dashed
a
loose
curl
from

herself
headlong
upon

a
burst
of
sobs
that

the

of

questions
but
for
a
long
time
remained
moodily
looking
with
narrowed
eyes
and
burning
heart
at
the
daughter
chapter
xxxix
two
days
later
on
friday
evening
teola
slipped
quietly
from
her
home
and
the
skinner
hut

timid
knock

no
more
fear
when
visitors
came
ben
letts

gone
with

and
ezra
longman
was
dead
the
girls
eyed

for

embarrassed
moment
the
day
for

at

face
the
lean
winter
teola
the
burden
of
a
conscience
in

teola

out
spontaneously
we

wish

were
going
to
stay
with
you
and
the
baby
gloomily
tess
scrutinized
the
young
mother
checking
an
ejaculation
that
rose
to
her
lips
i
do

what
you
are
going
to
do
said
teola
tess

replied
tess
turning
her
back
she
had
grown
to
love
the
hapless
thing
and
knew
that
he
suffered
as
all
human
beings
suffer
when
they
go
slowly
away
to
the
mystery
of
mysteries
teola
next
words
brought
her
about
sharply
tessibel

my
breath
when

of

tess
he
ai
to

never
then
bounded
from
tessibel
lips
the
passion
in
the
tones
lowering
the
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
no
replied
the
young
mother
i
ca
tell
him
the
squatter
just
caught
the
next
words
but
i
am

the
conviction
in

ai

three
hemorrhages

she
ended
brokenly
she

so
forlorn
so
thin
and
ill
that

awkwardly
to
her
i
takes
care
of
the
brat

precious
baby

me
that
mark

she
concluded
rubbing
the
tiny
red
forehead
with
her
fingers
if
he
only
goes
when
i
do
god
could
be
so
cruel
as
to
let
him
live
with
his

with
decision

all

here
with
the
hoss
doctor
and
they
says
he

to

quick
teola
raised
her
head
startled
oh
i
did
know
you
had
had
a
doctor
i
was
going
to
speak
about
it
she
dropped
her
eyes
reddened
and
then
added
but
the
horse
doctor
tessibel
squatters
allers
has
the
hoss
doctor
they
air
cheaper
but
he
ca
die
teola
moaned
not
now
not
yet
he
has
never
been
baptized
if
he
died
now
he
would
go
to
heaven
aw
shut
up
he
air
in
any
of
them
do
you
worry
yer
head
over
that
god
ai
that
kind
of
a
bloke
that
he
would
take
in
a
sick
brat
what
ai
never
done
no
harm
tess
had
risen
and
was
standing
over
the
child
teola
having
placed
him
back
in
the
bed
but
you
do
understand
tess
dear
you
see
it
this
way
the
bible
says
that
if
a
child
is
baptized
he
will
go
to
a
place
where
he
must
stay
always
he
wo
go
to
heaven
you
understand
air
the
bible
that
yes
wo
he
go
to
a
place
where
god
find
him
if
he
ai
sprinkled
no
that
air
strange
the
poor
brat
air
so
blue
so
shiverin
he
air
so
sick
aw
christ
love
him
he
ai
got
no
friends
her
eyes
spread
wide
with
infinite
compassion
as
she
contemplated
the
child
did
the
student
tell
ye
that
the
bible
were
that
she
asked
peremptorily
yes
and
my
father
has
often
preached
upon
it
i
know
that
it
is
true
insisted
teola
a
child
must
be
cleansed
of
its
original
sin
in
the
church
you
see
you
see
tess
i
do
see
i
do
know
nuther
but
what
the
student
says
air
right
if
the
little
kid
ai
to
see
god
face
he
air
slapped
on
the
head
with
water
in
the
church
then
the
brat
air
got
to
be
tooked
there
but
but
tess
is
it
possible
again
the
squatter
bent
her
head
to
gather
the
words
he
air
to
die
she
replied
with
conviction
and
he
has
to
be
hit
with
the
water
if
he
air
to
die
do
he
air
that
what
ye
means
teola
dropping
her
face
upon
the
babe
bowed
her
head
in
assent
and
wept
silently
until
the
cough
that
had
fastened
itself
upon
the
slender
chest
since
the
coming
of
the
child
dried
the
tears
tess
remained
quiet
until
the
paroxysm
had
passed
air
yer
pappy
a
good
sprinkler
of
brats
teola
nodded
air
it
likely
he
would
sprinkle
this
i
do
think
my
father
would
turn
away
a
dying
babe
that
needed
cleansing
of
its
sin
by
the
holy
ghost
the
huly
what
the
student
were
him
once
the
holy
ghost
explained
teola
he
lives
in
the
church
and
when
a
baby
is
baptized
he
comes
and
stands
by
the
font
and
when
the
water
falls
upon
it
he
takes
away
all
the
sin
that
it
is
born
with
tess
grunted
disbelievingly
can
ye
sees
him
no
he
is
a
spirit
ye
mean
that
he
air
like
the
headless
man
from

and

into

gleaming
with
heavenly
resolve
and
uplifted
faith

teola
evidently
did
not
hear
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
face
of
the
babe
her
mouth
twitching
nervously
at
the
corners
she
wondered
silently
what
her
father
would
say
when
tess
presented
the
child
for
baptism
on
sunday
morning
she
could
imagine
her
own
happiness
after
it
was
all
over
she
thought
she
would
get
better
for
a
time
she
remembered
how
her
mother
had
worried
over
her
cough
how
her
father
had
advised
with
the
best
doctors
of
the
city
but
they
had
gravely
shaken
their
heads
saying
that
the
girl
might
grow
out
of
it
they
hoped
she
would
but
day
by
day
she
had
seen
herself
growing
more
and
more
slender
more
and
more
and
as
teola
knelt
over
the
child
in
the
flickering
candlelight
tess
shivered
superstitiously
the
young
mother
was
so
white
that
the
squatter
could
almost
have
imagined
her
one
of
ma
moll
ghosts
they
be
ye
from
yer
house
remarked
tess
after
a
long
stillness
yes
i
hear
them
it
is
my
father
but
i
am
so
tired
that
it
seems
as
if
i
could
never
climb
the
hill
i
see
you
a
minute
tess
if
i
ca
will
you
bring
the
baby
to
the

thank
you

tessibel
chapter
xl
minister
graves
watched
his
child
painfully
climb
the
front
steps
he
could
see
even
through
the
dim
shadows
how
thin
she
had
become
how
she
panted
for
breath
over
the
slight
exertion
of
walking
up
the
hill
a
thought
that
stung
him
like
a
whip
seized
him
convulsing
his
heart
and
shaking
his
powerful
frame
as
if
he
had
been
attacked
by
sudden
ague
was
his
daughter
going
to
die
she
could
not
die
god
would
not
take
her
from
him
he
remembered
teola
birth
with
a
groan
of
pain
remembered
how
he
had
taken
the
babe
so
tiny
and
helpless
into
his
study
alone
and
had
uttered
the
sincerest
prayer
of
a
father
life
that
the
blessings
of
heaven
would
cover
his
treasure
and
would
guide
the
little
footsteps
during
the
whole
bright
future
her
future
must
be
bright
with
his
love
to
shield
her
he
could
remember
each
succeeding
day
his
pride
and
ambitions
for
her
and
now
teola
paused
on
the
top
step
clinging
to
the
veranda
pillar
he
came
hastily
to
her
the
darkness
covering
the
emotions
that
had
paled
his
face
and
bent
over
the
exhausted
girl
kissing
her
lips
tenderly
teola
darling
my
darling
why
will
you
persist
in
being
out
at
night
see
now
how
you
are
coughing

what
would
become
of
me
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
teola
knew
the
heart
of
her
father
he
had
sternly
preached
orthodox
doctrine
had
persecuted
the
squatters
according
to
his
beliefs
but
he
loved
his
children
and
especially
had
he
idolized
her
the
thought
of
the
babe
in
the
fisherman
hut
sped
through
her
mind
her
consternation
and
horror
if
she
should
be
compelled
to
tell
her
secret
but
tessibel
stood
in
her
place
as
mother
to
the
little
boy
and
had
taken
an
oath
that
nothing
could
force
her
to
break
the
squatter
had
been
the
scapegoat
upon
which
had
been
heaped
the
sins
of
a
girl
no
one
had
thought
capable
of
doing
wrong
teola
resting
in
her
father
arms
struggled
with
her
conscience
trying
to
press
down
the
moral
weakness
that
had
compelled
her
to
keep
the
tragedy
in
the
cabin
quiet
the
minister
helped
her
to
her
chamber
and
after
she
had
retired
went
in
and
prayed
with
and
for
her
his
voice
low
and
tender
with
the
exquisite
tones
of
an
orator

strangely

but
you
begged
so
hard
to
stay
at

teola
had
coveted
the
chance
to
tell
him
of
the
little
human
link
between
dan

life
and
hers
she
raised
herself
on
her
pillow
the
long
hair
mantling
her
shoulders
and
aureoling
the
face

she
gasped

me
tell
you
something
about

your
fingers
over
my

interjected
graves
gravely
if
you
want
to
displease
me
she
so
lonely
broke
in
the
girl
her
courage
ebbing
away
under
the
bent
brows
of
her
father
i
thought
you
might
help
her
go
to
sleep
replied
the
minister
there
a
good
girl
for
a
moment
teola
lay
panting
nervously
she
had
been
so
near
the
confession
so
near
telling
her
father
about
the
little
babe
in
the
shanty
she
slipped
out
of
bed
to
the
window
the
wind
still
flung
the
dead
leaves
whirling
them
to
and
fro
in
the
orchard
like
willful
spirits
the
night
had
darkened
until
to
teola
shivering
and
ill
it
seemed
alive
with
shadowy
goblins
which
mocked
at
her
she
could
just
make
out
the
dark
line
of
the
hut
under
the
willow
branches
a
candlelight
flickered
a
moment
in
the
window
and
was
gone
teola
moaned
long
muttering
loving
messages
to
the
child
cuddled
in
tessibel
arms
she
loved
it
but
could
not
bring
it
home
yet
at
last
sleep
a
deep
fatigued
sleep
enveloped
her
she
was
too
tired
to
dream
after
tess
was
alone
she
made
ready
for
bed
the
child
whimpered
drowsily
the
squatter
lifted
it
up
with
infinite
tenderness
binding
the
rags
more
closely
about
the
scrawny
body
ye
do
amount
to
as
much
as
the
tuft
on
kennedy
mare

said
aloud

i
opens
yer

and
pours
it

harsh
but
the
emotion
in
the
tones
softened
them
ye

ye
wo

and
ye
have
the
smell
of
a
dead

and

ye
poor
little

the
child
strangling
for
breath
gulped
down
a
mouthful
of
milk
but
the
jaws
set
again
and
the
lips
settled
into
a
blue
line
tess
prepared
the
sugar
rag
putting
in
a
large
amount
of
sweet
and
dipped
it
in
the
in
which
she
had
warmed
the
milk
then
she
allowed
a
little
of
the
syrup
to
fall
upon
the
lips
the
mouth
snapped
upon
it
and
long
after
tess
had
gathered
the
infant
into
her
arms
the
smacking
went
on
and
on
until
both
slept
neither
heard
the
wind
that
rattled
the
hut
boards
that
rasped
its
endless
sawing
on
the
tin
roof
neither
heard
the
willow
branches
brushing
to
and
fro
against
the
rickety
chimney
the
child
slept
the
sleep
of
a
human
creature
moving
silently
toward
death
and
tess
the
sleep
of
the
exhausted
the
next
morning
she
stood
in
the
doorway
grimly
watching
the
cottagers
boats
loaded
with
household
goods
one
by
one
as
they
passed
this
time
of
year
was
prophetic
of
the
coming
winter
and
told
tess
a
few
more
weeks
would
see
the
snow
piled
up
about
the
hut
and
the
lake
covered
with
ice
deacon

launch
steamed
by
with
huge
piles
of
bedding
heaped
up
on
the
bow
one
after
another
of
the
summer
residents
disappeared
in
the
inlet
and
tess
was
waiting
for
the
people
also
to
leave
she
heard
frederick
voice
in
the
lane
and
closed
the
door
pressing
her
face
to
the
window
she
saw
him
climb
into
his
father
little
yacht
to
make
it
ready
for
the
summer
stock
from
the
cottage
teola
too
was
on
the
shore
and
tess
saw
the
girl
turn
longing
eyes
toward
the
hut
then
with
a
boyish
tug
at
his
belt
frederick
started
up
the
hill
his
face
in
profile
showed
the
squatter
that
he
had
changed
he
was
thinner
paler
and
looked
years
older
closer
pressed
the
sweet
face
to
the
dirty
pane
brighter
grew
the
brown
eyes
drawn
by
his
own
desire
the
student
turned
and
looked
at
her
first
an
expression
of
eagerness
leaped
into
his
face
then
one
of
sorrow
settled
upon
it
he
went
on
to
the
cottage
without
even
nodding
his
head
he
would
soon
come
down
with
his
father
mother
and
sister
babe
and
tess
would
see
him
no
more
she
sank
down
upon
the
bed
beside
the
sucking
child
and
did
not
hear
the
hut
door
open
softly
tess
tess
it
teola

the
squatter
choked
back
her
tears

so
thin
and
ill
tess
tears
trickled
down
upon
the
infant

pressed
her
lips
again
and
again
to
the
thin
mouth
the
vivid
mark
was
offering
its
crimson
tinge
sharply
against
the
dead
blue
of
the
rest
of
the
baby
face
and
tess
burst
forth
teola
how
gladly
i
would
give
you
a
dress
for

the
dignity
of
a
queen
the
fine
young
head
had
settled
back
upon
the
broad
shoulders
sloping
bare
at
the
arms
the
sweet
face
gave
the
lie
to
the
hardened
speech
uttered
from
the
grief
she
had
just
spent
upon
the
bed
do
speak
like
that

gasped
teola
some
day
after
the
babe
and
i
are
dead
teola
had
come
close
to
the
her
pale
face
thrust
beseechingly
forward
tess
hesitated
then
flung
out
her
arms
and
drew
the
minister
daughter
into
them
her
eyes
were
filled
with
awe
indescribable
i
a
mean
brat
to
make
ye
say
that

faltered

brings
the
kid
to

strong
breast
and

and
his

come
after
him
poor

cried
softly
till
frederick
voice
on

rang
out
sharply
in
answer
to
a
question
from
his
father
teola
kissed
her
babe
over
and
over
drawing
a
small
shawl
about
her
shoulders
and
picked
a
path
out
through

his
glowering
glances

teola
with
her
illness

suddenly

to
share
her
secret
with
longman
she
would
beg
a
dress
for
little

to
wear
to
the

for
his

she
had
stubbornly
kept
the
presence
of
the
child
in
her
hut
from
her
squatter

although
myra
had
usually
had
a
way
of
worming
into

had
given
her
oath
and

to

feared
to
tell

prepared
the
basket
with
the
clean
clothes
that
teola
had
left
on
the
tree
and
with
the
easy
grace
of
a
barefooted
squatter
set
out
for
the
ragged
rocks
with
bounding
steps
illustration
she
tossed
her
face
up
to
the
sun
across
the
lake

of

with

and

of

smooth
like

glass
and
the
birds
were
racing
in
flocks
over
it
from
the
north
toward
the
south
their
flight
was
so
rapid
that
the
squatter
paused
and
followed
them
with
her
eyes
one
flock
after
another
disappeared
behind
the
college
hill
so
quickly
that
tess
could
scarcely
bid
them
farewell
they
were

with
brilliant

and
the

with

free
life
came
back
to
her
she
stooped
down
and
placed
the
basket
upon
the
rocks
and
with
her
arms
flung
over
her
head
tossed
her
face
up
to
the
sun
her
soul
was
dreaming
and
the
dream
changed
the
eyes
from
brown
to
black
she
stood
silently
her
gaze
roving
after
the
birds
they
were
leaving
her
to
the
winter
and
the
sick
child
but
daddy
dear
old
daddy
was
coming
back
home
she
caught
her
breath
at
that
moment
her
father
was
the
panacæa
for
all
that
she
had
suffered
during
the
last
few
weeks
tears
welled
into
her
eyes
just
then
another
great
flock
of
black
birds
huddling
together
skimmed
by
through
the
clear
air
tess
threw
out
her
hands
she
shouted
with
conflicting
emotions
come
back
again
soon
it
air
lonely
in
the
winter
without
ye
as
if
the
birds
understood
the
longing
in
a
kindred
soul
the
flock
halted
an
instant
seemingly
loath
to
go
circled
their
mass
of
black
toward
the
sky
swept
to
the
water
edge
poised
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
then
shot
towards
the
university
hill
and
disappeared
with
the
of
youth
tess
reached
the
longman
cabin
a
silence
reigned
within
which
at
first
astonished
her
the
door
was
closed
and
satisfied
was
nowhere
in
sight
she
paused
before
rapping
and
looked
to
the
shore
for
the
boat
disappointment
shot
through
her
satisfied
and
longman
had
gone
to
the
city
nevertheless
tess
tapped
lightly
and
then
again
but
no
voice
ordered
her
in
she
lifted
the
latch
felt
the
door
yield
to
her
touch
and
stepped
inside
four
lean
rats
scurried
cornerward
sinking
from
sight
into
dark
holes
numbers
of
lizards
tailed
silently
backward
from
the
sunbeam
slanting
across
the
shanty
door
but
the
sight
was
so
usual
to
tess
that
she
merely
turned
her
head
slightly
and
smiled
as
if
to
departing
friends
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
a
long
object
stretched
out
upon
a
board
arrested
her
steps
it
was
covered
with
a
sheet
and
the
breathless
gloom
of
the
shanty
caused
tess
almost
to
drop
the
basket
as
she
set
it
down
the
silent
white
thing
on
the
board
brought
an
exclamation
of
fear
from
her
with
horror
settling
deep
in
her
eyes
she
backed
against
the
door
did
the
sheet
cover
death
no
for
ezra
had
been
carried
to
his
grave
the
day
before
the
thought
freed
her
from
a
terror
that
had
gripped
her
senses
at
first
she
took
two
steps
forward
bent
down
and
looked
under
the
board
little
streams
of
water
had
made
dark
tracks
across
the
hut
floor
the
corners
of
the
sheet
were
drenched
through
this
sent
tess
back
once
more
to
the
door
would
she
dare
lift
the
sheet
controlling
her
fear
by
an
effort
tess
gathered
her
courage
together
and
crept
again
to
the
long
board
with
shaking
fingers
she
lifted
the
cloth
and
drew
it
back
gently
then
a
horrified
cry
fell
sharply
from
her
lips
and
she
dropped
it
ben
letts
and
myra
longman
hugged
in
each
other
arms
lay
dead
before
her
fascinated
and
trembling
she
stood
considering
the
livid
squatters
no
sound
after
the
first
cry
issuing
from
her
pale
lips
the
dead
faces
were
so
close
to
each
other
that
a
human
hand
could
not
pass
between
them
upon
the
plain
face
of
myra
rested
a
peaceful
expression
as
if
she
possessed
a
quietude
she
had
never
known
before
her
eyes
were
closed
and
one
arm
was
tightly
clasped
about
ben
neck
the
other
about
his
waist
the
storm
had
loosened
the
meager
hair
had
flung
it
in
disorder
over
the
shoulders
ben
brown
teeth
gleamed
dark
the
drawn
lips
were
stretched
wide
as
if
a
pain
dreadful
and
torturing
had
opened
them
never
to
be
closed
again
his
two
huge
arms
twisted
about
the
frail
frame
of
the
girl
were
locked
together
by
the
horny
fingers
to
tessibel
it
seemed
that
myra
smiled
faintly
in
the
possession
of
her
happiness
she
had
ben
letts
at
last
and
forever
he
was
her
gift
of
the
storm
the
eternal
gift
of
a
wild
night
myra
had
sought
and
had
found
him
the
shanty
door
pushed
open
like
one
in
a
dream
tess
was
still
looking
down
upon
the
dead
lifting
her
gaze
she
saw
satisfied
watching
her
his
eyes
glowing
with
subdued
pain
myry
air

said
in
a
low
voice
coming
forward

the
squatter
girl
and
the
brat
finished
longman
tess
startled
lifted
up

head

she
muttered

yep
he

longman
drew
down
the
sheet
still
further
exposing
the
lifeless
baby
the
thin
little
body
lay
between
the
father
and
mother
for
many
minutes
they
surveyed
the
dead
trio
in
rapt
attention
where

myry

place

there
was
something
strangely
pathetic
in
the
quiet
words
in
the
stolid
ugly
face
with
its
hard
lines
in
the
mouth
twitching
at
the
corners
as
he
spoke
tess
sprang
toward
him
and
wound
her
strong
young
arms
about
him
myry
air
happy
she
burst
forth
happier
than
when
she
were
with
you
she
air
with
ben

over

blinked
confusedly
at
her
words

drew
his
heavy
brows
down
darkly

ben
tess
went
on
hurriedly
and
the
brat

as
how

satisfied
she
were
ben

the
pain
in
his
clouded
blue
eyes
stung
tess
to
the
heart
the
grief
of
this
lonely
old
man
bereft
of
his
all
seemed
the
most
tragic
spectacle
she

yep
she
replied
trying
to
smile
through
her
tears
she
were
him
and
were
his
lovin
all
the
time
it
were
only
in
the
storm

longman
made
a
protesting
motion
some
fishermen
had
picked
the
two
dead
ones
up
locked
in
each
other
arms
and
he
himself
had
covered
them
with
a
sheet
without
making
an
effort
to
part
them
he
had
not
thought
of
putting
them
in
the
squatters
cemetery
together
and
let
the
brat
stay
with

tess
broke
in
on
his
reverie
yep
he
replied
i

what
myry
seeked
for
and
found
she
can

the
listening
girl

there
was
hatred
in
the
father
tones
for

letts
well
she
had
hated

too
but
he
was
all

and
there

of
the
night
on
the
ragged
rocks
and
of
myra
broken
wrist
but
with
a
flashing
glance
at
the
dead
woman
changed
her
mind
in
her
vivid
imagination
she
thought
that
myra
was
silently
entreating
her
not
to
speak
ill
of
the
dead
man
in
her
arms
she
told
me
that

girl
slipped
her
hand
into

reassuringly
as

disappearing
into

back
room
tessibel

forgotten
the
child
in

basket
she
turned
her
eyes
toward

and
a
movement
of
the
cover
told
her
that
the
little
dan
was
awake
she
was
bending
over
it
when
longman
appeared
at
her
side
mammy

as

until

the

made
her
choice
from
the
small
stock
of
dresses
that
had
been
worn
by
the
longman
family
and
had
at

descended

reverie
deep
and
sweet
chapter
xlii
sunday
morning
tessibel
was
out
upon
the
tracks
walking
swiftly
toward
the
city
she
could
hear
the
church
bell
at
haytes
corner
ringing
out
a
welcome
to
the
country
folk
she
could
hear
the
tolling
of
the
chapel
bell
from
the
university
hill
clothed
in
the
clean
skirt
she
had
washed
at
the
time
she
had
thought
of
going
to
auburn
prison
and
a
worn
but
clean
jacket
tess
felt
fit
to
face
the
in
ithaca
of
course
she
was
barefooted
for
daddy
boots
were
too
big
to
wear
into
the
house
of
the
student
god
earlier
in
the
morning
tessibel
had
sat
for
a
long
time
upon
the
small
fishing
dock
swinging
her
feet
in
the
clear
water
they
too
like
the
skirt
and
jacket
were
clean
in
the
basket
snuggling
in
the
nest
of
white
clothes
lay
little
dan
he
was
robed
in
the
garment
of
the
longman
child
and
tessibel
had
looked
at
him
with
pride
as
she
settled
him
in
his
bed
preparatory
to
her
trip
she
passed
swiftly
through
the
city
and
crossed
dewitt
park
how
vividly
she
remembered
the
many
midnights
she
had
taken
the
same
way
turning
toward
the
jail
to
visit
daddy
tessibel
paused
before
minister
graves
church
and
heard
him
read
in
deep
tones
from
the
scriptures
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
harmonious
voice
floated
through
the
window
to
the
now
crouched
in
the
sun
every
word
fell
distinctly
upon
her
ear
she
lifted
the
basket
cover
and
peeped
in
upon
the
babe
he
looked
bluer
and
thinner
than
tess
had
ever
seen
him
his
lips
rested
upon
the
rag
with
no
indrawing
movement
unblinkingly
stared
the
wide
gray
eyes
when
the
sunbeams
flashed
upon
his
face
the
vivid
grew
fainter
in
the
yellow
light
tess
drew
him
into
the
shade
and
waited
the
tones
rolled
out
like
thunder
when
dominie
graves
bade
the
members
of
his
flock
bring
their
children
to
the
holy
font
that
they
might
receive
the
blessing
of
god
and
everlasting
life
tess
heard
him
say
that
the
father
in
heaven
demanded
that
all
children
should
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
crucified
saviour
that
to
put
off
such
a
duty
might
prove
dangerous
to
their
eternal
welfare
many
of
the
long
words
the
squatter
did
not
understand
but
she
gathered
enough
to
know
how
necessary
it
was
to
obey
the
minister
commands
she
glanced
again
at
the
babe
with
a
worried
pucker
between
her
eyes
there
was
the
same
stare
the
same
unmoving
lips
but
he
was
quiet
and
tessibel
let
him
lie
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labor
and
are
rang
forth
the
powerful
voice
it
fell
upon
the
girl
and
soothed
her
tess
knew
that
teola
would
be
expecting
her
and
that
frederick
would
turn
his
face
away
when
she
presented
the
child
for
baptism
but
no
cloud
gathered
into
the
downcast
eyes
for
tessibel
faith
had
grown
since
she
knew
that
myra
prayers
had
been
answered
had
she
not
seen
the
girl
clasped
in
the
arms
of
the
fisherman
who
had
once
said
that
he
hated
her
had
she
not
seen
the
smile
upon
the
dead
lips
which
dripped
with
lake
water
tessibel
had
never
before
been
so
confident
in
prayer
and
upon
this
beautiful
sunday
morning
in
the
white
light
of
day
kneeling
under
the
church
window
she
believed
that
god
would
give
her
back
the
student
some
time
she
thought
of
the
pain
that
would
rest
in
the
proud
dark
eyes
of
the
boy
when
he
saw
her
but
she
smiled
because
she
knew
that
god
lived
heard
and
answered
the
prayers
of
the
an
anthem
rolled
up
from
the
church
choir
chanting
out
the
love
of
christ
chanting
his
crucifixion
and
death
for
a
dying
world
come
unto
me
come
unto
me
it
sang
and
come
unto
me
rose
from
the
lips
of
the
squatter
waiting
to
take
the
little
human
thing
with
its
burden
of
sickness
and
death
to
dominie
graves
that
he
might
petition
the
holy
ghost
to
take
away
its
sin
come
unto
me
again
sang
the
choir
then
silence
tess
leaned
nearer
the
window
dominie
graves
read
out
the
names
of
the
babies
to
be
baptized
that
day
a
carriage
rolled
rapidly
to
the
church
door
and
deacon
hall
accompanied
by
his
wife
stepped
to
the
pavement
the
deacon
held
a
bundle
with
long
white
draperies
hanging
from
it
it
was
their
new
baby
with
lace
upon
its
frock
going
in
to
receive
a
blessing
at
the
altar
of
god
tess
peered
down
upon
the
little
dan
and
pulled
the
coarse
dress
closer
about
his
chin
a
violent
wish
born
of
the
love
she
had
for
him
came
into
her
heart
oh
that
she
had
one
bit
of
lace
to
make
his
skin
look
less
blue
and
the
mouth
less
drawn
the
wide
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
her
immovable
and
unblinking
once
only
had
she
seen
the
lids
fall
slowly
downward
to
rise
again
over
the
unseeing
eyes
he
knows
he
air
to
church
she
muttered
lovingly
i
wonder
if
that
air
why
he
air
so
good
mebbe
the
spirit
of
his
pappy
air
here
she
heard
the
names
fall
from
the
lips
of
the
clergyman
as
he
took
the
infants
one
by
one
and
placed
his
hand
upon
them
with
the
water
i
baptize
thee
john
richard
graves
said
slowly
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
of
the
holy
ghost
he
was
the
spirit
of
god
who
stood
by
the
children
to
take
away
the
sin
with
which
they
had
been
born
teola
had
told
tess
so
the
holy
ghost
would
take
away
the
sin
of
little
dan
i
baptize
thee
broke
the
silence
time
after
time
amid
the
tiny
splashes
of
falling
water
the
last
must
have
gone
up
to
the
altar
for
tess
heard
the
minister
telling
the
fathers
and
mothers
the
duty
they
owed
their
children
i
finish
my
service
said
he
by
praying
god
to
bless
you
all
and
calling
down
the
of
heaven
upon
your
children
just
baptized
in
his
name
tessibel
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
rest
she
raised
the
child
from
the
basket
shielding
him
from
the
sun
with
her
body
stretched
him
out
reverently
upon
her
hands
and
tiptoed
up
the
long
flight
of
steps
into
the
church
a
sea
of
heads
rose
before
her
startled
vision
transfixed
she
paused
in
the
door
waiting
for
graves
to
cease
speaking
her
eye
caught
the
pew
of
the
minister
teola
sat
next
to
frederick
on
the
end
graves
between
her
and
her
younger
daughter
tess
noticed
the
tense
expression
upon
the
sharp
profile
of
the
babe
mother
how
glad
teola
would
be
when
the
baby
was
baptized
how
happy
in
the
heaven
for
her
child
the
minister
voice
had
fallen
into
a
prayer
and
still
tess
waited
with
the
dying
infant
staring
upward
at
the
great
church
dome
every
head
was
bowed
no
one
saw
the
strange
girl
with
hair
flung
wide
about
her
shoulders
nor
the
tiny
human
being
resting
upon
her
hands
silence
fell
upon
the
congregation
and
tessibel
commenced
her
walk
down
through
the
sea
of
faces
to
the
pulpit
she
gave
no
glance
toward
teola
as
she
passed
but
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
dominie
graves
who
without
noticing
her
had
turned
to
the
little
flight
of
steps
that
led
to
his
pulpit
when
he
reached
the
bible
stand
and
opened
his
lips
to
speak
his
gaze
dropped
upon
the
squatter
at
first
he
thought
he
was
dreaming
he
looked
again
looked
at
her
at
the
child
and
paled
to
his
ears
tessibel
was
holding
the
infant
up
toward
him
with
a
beseeching
expression
in
her
eyes
that
staggered
him
teola
had
seen
tess
pass
and
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
thin
child
upon
her
hands
the
pursed
baby
lips
from
which
hung
the
useless
sugar
rag
made
her
lower
her
head
to
the
prayer
cushion
shuddering
violently
frederick
had
also
seen
the
squatter
everyone
in
the
church
had
seen
her
and
the
silence
grew
wider
and
wider
until
even
breathing
was
hushed
to
catch
her
words
her
low
sweet
voice
began
to
speak
it
thrilled
through
the
congregation
like
the
song
of
angels
illustration
be
ye
goin
to
let
him
go
a
place
where
god
ca
find

began
tess
with
shaking
voice
who
has
got
to
be
sprinkled
or
he
ca
go
to
heaven
the
vast
silence
of
the
edifice
echoed
her
petition
the
gaping
minister
never
once
took
his
eyes
from
her
face
and
made
no
move
to
answer
her
it
air
i
say
she
went
on
and
i
wants
ye
to
put
the
water
on
it
so
deadly
in
earnest
was
the
girl
that
a
sob
broke
out
in
the
back
of
the
church
the
lithe
barefooted
squatter
and
the
feeble
dying
child
offered
a
living
picture
of
pathos
which
with
its
tragedy
slowly
dawned
upon
the
more
sensitive
minds
silently
telling
its
tale
of
human
suffering
minister
graves
refused
to
answer
her
he
wore
the
same
expression
of
scorn
tess
had
seen
in
the
student
when
she
had
acknowledged
the
child
as
hers
be
ye
goin
to
sprinkle
him
she
demanded
steadfastly
her
voice
growing
stronger
with
her
emotions
be

voice
fell
like
the
sound
of
a
bell
be

place
where

be
ye
tess
entreated
anger
and
revolt
glinted
through
the
of
her
eyes
she
swayed
back
a
little
from
the
font
still
holding
out
the
babe

so

pleaded
with
a
choke
and
so

worse
than
this
one
she
turned
round
and
faced
the
wall
of
white
faces
sending
the
question
out
in
tones
then
graves
spoke
with
austerity
and
strength
riding
down
his
anger
with
a
mighty
effort
you
will
please
take
the
child
from
the
church
you
have
your
own
squatter
mission
for
such
as
that
he
had
forgotten
his
members
forgotten
that
he
was
a
man
of
god
as
he
bent
toward
her
he
remembered
only
that
she
was
the
girl
who
had
thwarted
him
who
had
won
in
the
squatter
fight
against
his
own
influence
tessibel
heard
the
words
squatter
and
mission
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
take
the
child
there
she
looked
down
upon
the
little
face

until
she
could
get
him
there
he
might
be
dead
before
she
could
carry
him
to
the
inlet
and
cross
the
tracks
to
the
young
rector

said
that
the
baby
would
never
be
with
his
father
without

that
even

his

could
not
see
him
when

live
far
from

bright

her
anger
rose
in
a
twinkling
she
took
another
backward
step
threw
the
red
curls
into
a
mass
over
her
shoulder
and
spoke
again

to

stepped
forward
to
the
font

a
look
of
hatred
at
graves
and
suddenly
dipped
her
hand
into
the
water
i
sprinkles

ended
the
drops

upon
the
livid
baby
face
dripping
down
upon
the
bare
feet
of
the
squatter
i
baptize
tess
wavered
for
lack
of
words
she
had
thought
she
could
not
forget
the
benediction
a
voice
from
the
back
of
the
church
broke
in
abruptly
upon
her
hesitation
i

it
rang
in
the
name
of
the

and
of
the

and
of
the
holy

was
in
the
middle

an
entreating
silent
appeal
to

from

throats
like
the
distant
murmuring
of
the

hopkins
sat
down
saying
no
more
minister
graves
had
sunk
into
his
chair
and
on
the
girl
last
words
the
congregation
drew
a
long
gasping
breath
the
eyes
of
the
babe
gazed
steadily
on
into
the
shadows
of
eternal
silence
the
water
seemingly
unfelt
upon
its
head
the
small
boy
was
slipping
away
to
that
place
of
mystery
where
his
father
myra
and
ben
letts
had
gone
the
long
days
of
suffering
with
the
child
in
the
hut
rushed
over

dropped
on
her
knees
facing
the
pulpit
and
hugged
him
to
her
breast
and
whispered
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
then
another
voice
shrill
sobbing
and
terrible
hushed
her
prayer
the
squatter
instinctively
shifted
her
position
toward
the
dominie
pew
teola

standing
up
tall
and
pale
and
was
looking
directly
at

cried

the
baby
and
baptize
him
in
the
name

lost

it
again
and
finished

she
wrenched
herself
loose
from
frederick
detaining
fingers
and
was
in
the
aisle
before
her
brother
realized
what
had
happened
he
my
baby
she
cried
between
the
spasmodic
pressures
upon
her
chest
tess
tess
is

dead
yep
he

dead
fell
from
tessibel
for
she
had
seen
the
large
glazed
eyes
draw
in
at
the
corners
and
the
little
face
blanch
the
tiny
spirit
fled
as
the
frantic
clasped
her
babe
to
her
breast
but
he
air
gone
to
his
pappy
consoled
the
squatter
for
one
awful
moment

looked
into
the
accusing
eyes
of
his
congregation
bill
hopkins
was
seated
with
his
face
in
his
hands
but
augusta
hall
with
her
new
baby
folded
tightly
in

looking
at

for

he
appealed
dizzily
christ

frederick
pressed
his
way
to
his
sister
side
the
squatter
threw
up
her
head
before
him
for
the
first
time
since
that
last
dreadful
night
she
looked
directly
into
his
eyes
her
dishonor
slipping
from
her
like
a
loosened
garment
frederick
soul
shone
forth
in
the
glance
he
sent
her

in
his

time

given
her
back
the
student
tessibel
turned
and
passed
up
through
the
mute
gathering

hopkins
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
her
child
he
said
brokenly
you
are
the
one
bright
spirit
in
this
generation
but
tessibel
did
not
understand
she
went
down
the
long
flight
of
steps
and
into
the
street
with
but
a
backward
glance
at
the
basket
she
had
left
under
the
church
window
chapter
xliii
tessibel
was
a
child
again
a
happy
child
the
body
of
her
death
had
fallen
away
as
christian
burden
had
slipped
from
his
shoulders
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
the
babe
had
gone
to
its
father
with
the
blessing
of
the
holy
ghost
then
tess
thought
of
teola
and
stopped
on
the
tracks
the
last
words
rushing
into
her
mind
she
had
understood
the
import
of
them
it
had
been
carried
to
her
by
the
awful
expression
upon
graves
face
he
was
sorry
this
minister
who
had
persecuted
her
father
and
herself
sorry
for
teola
sorry
for
the

and

though
she
murmured
but
the
student
air
me
for
the
next
two
miles
she
sang
lustily
childishly
with
the
complete
abandon
of
a
girl
without
a
burden
daddy
skinner
was
coming
home
and
god
had
given
her
back
the
student
the
remembrance
of
his
eyes
thrilled
her
from
head
to
foot
tess
passed
down
the
lane
glad
for
myra
glad
for
teola
and
her
child
glad
for
everyone
she
was
still
singing
when
she
crossed
the
wide
plank
that
spanned
the
creek
she
saw
professor
young
leaning
against
the
shanty
door
and
the
memory
of
their
last
conversation
when
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
made
her
pause
awkwardly
the
color
flying
in
rich
waves
from
the
red
forehead
ringlets
to
the
shapely
neck
young
took
her
hand
looking
searchingly
into
her
face
where
is
the

demanded
in
low
tones

took
it
back
to
its

halted
with
her
hand
on
the
door
waiting
for

to
finish

there
he
spoke
slowly
deliberately
tess
gazed
at
him
trying
to
read
his
thoughts
nevertheless
she
obeyed
him
pressing
open
the
door
with
an
impatient
movement
of
her
head
she
had
waited
so
long
for
just
this
moment
to
know
when
the
big
humpbacked
father
was
coming
home
seemed
more
precious
to
tessibel
than
all
the
uplifting
joy
she
had
experienced
that
day
her
eyes
swept
the
hut
then
they
rested
in
a
frightened
glance
upon
daddy
skinner
seated
on
his
own
stool
he
was
smiling
at
her
with
misty
eyes
his
lips
showing
his
dark
teeth
with
each
incoming
breath
deforest
young

the
girl
bound
forward
and
the
red
curls

the
huge
fisherman

blurred
his
sight

turned
into
the
day
to
regain
his
control

she
had
nestled
as
in
the
old
days
completely
under
his
chin
hair
crying
silently
deeply
with
sobs
for
a
long
time
they
sat
thus
until
the
man
outside
entered
and
spoke
to
them
tess
jubilantly
cooked
the
fish
for
dinner
spattering
the
bacon
fat
upon
the
floor
she
smiled
alternately
at
her
father
and
professor
young
she
caroled
like
a
spring
bird
with
bursts
of
happy
song
then
they
three
sat
down
to
the
table
to
eat
the
homely
squatter
fare
a
sickening
longing
swept
over
deforest
young
to
have

pale
sick

embarrassment
