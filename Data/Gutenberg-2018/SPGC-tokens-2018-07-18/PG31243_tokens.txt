forecast

preface
twenty
years
ago
the
author
started
a
career
in
technological
journalism
by
writing
descriptions
of
what
he
regarded
as
the
most
promising
inventions
which
had
been
displayed
in
international
exhibitions
then
recently
held
from
that
time
until
the
present
it
has
been
his
constant
duty
and
practice
to
take
note
of
the
advance
of
inventive
science
as
applied
to
industrial
improvement
to
watch
it
as
an
organic
growth
not
only
from
a
philosophical
but
also
from
a
practical
point
of
view
the
advance
towards
the
actual
adoption
of
any
great
industrial
invention
is
generally
a
more
or
less
collective
movement
and
in
the
course
of
a
practice
such
as
that
referred
to
the
habit
of
watching
the
signs
of
progress
has
been
naturally
acquired
moreover
it
has
always
been
necessary
to
take
a
comprehensive
rather
than
a
minute
or
detailed
view
of
the
progress
of
the
great
industrial
army
of
nineteenth
century
civilisation
towards
certain
objectives
it
is
better
for
some
purposes
of
technological
journalism
to
be
attached
to
the
staff
than
to
march
with
any
individual
company
for
the
war
correspondent
must
ever
place
himself
in
a
position
from
which
a
view
is
possible
the
personal
aspect
of
the
campaign
becomes
merged
in
that
which
regards
the
army
as
an
organic
unit
it
may
therefore
be
claimed
that
in
some
moderate
degree
the
author
is
fitted
by
training
and
opportunities
for
undertaking
the
necessarily
difficult
task
of
foretelling
the
trend
of
invention
and
industrial
improvement
during
the
twentieth
century
he
must
of
course
expect
to
be
wrong
in
a
certain
proportion
of
his
prognostications
but
like
the
meteorologists
he
will
be
content
if
in
a
fair
percentage
of
his
forecasts
it
should
be
admitted
that
he
has
reasoned
correctly
according
to
the
available
data
the
questions
to
be
answered
in
an
inquiry
as
to
the
chances
of
failure
or
success
which
lie
before
any
invention
or
proposed
improvement
are
first
whether
it
is
really
wanted
and
secondly
whether
the
environment
in
the
midst
of
which
it
must
make
its
début
is
favourable
these
requirements
generally
depend
upon
matters
which
to
a
large
extent
stand
apart
from
the
personal
qualifications
of
any
individual
inventor
in
the
course
of
a
search
through
the
vast
accumulations
of
the
patent
specifications
of
various
countries
the
thought
is
almost
irresistibly
forced
upon
the
mind
of
the
investigator
that
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
no
matter
how
far
back
he
may
push
his
inquiry
in
attempting
to
unveil
the
true
source
of
any
important
idea
he
will
always
find
at
some
antecedent
date
the
germ
either
of
the
same
inventive
conception
or
of
something
which
is
hardly
distinguishable
from
it
the
habit
of
research
into
the
origin
of
improved
industrial
method
must
therefore
help
to
strengthen
the
impression
of
the
importance
of
gradual
growth
and
of
general
tendencies
as
being
the
prime
factors
in
promoting
social
advancement
through
the
success
of
invention
the
same
habit
will
also
generally
have
the
effect
of
rendering
the
searcher
more
diffident
in
any
claims
which
he
may
entertain
as
to
the
originality
of
his
own
ideas
inventive
thought
has
been
so
enormously
stimulated
during
the
past
two
or
three
generations
that
the
public
recognition
of
a
want
invariably
sets
thousands
of
minds
thinking
about
the
possible
methods
of
ministering
to
it
startling
illustrations
of
this
fact
are
continually
cropping
up
in
the
experiences
of
patent
agents
and
others
who
are
engaged
in
technological
work
and
its
literature
the
average
inventor
is
almost
always
inclined
to
imagine
when
he
finds
another
man
working
in
exactly
the
same
groove
as
himself
that
by
some
means
his
ideas
have
leaked
out
and
have
been
pirated
but
those
who
have
studied
invention
as
a
social
and
industrial
force
know
that
nothing
is
more
common
than
to
find
two
or
more
inventors
making
entirely
independent
progress
in
the
same
direction
for
example
while
this
book
was
in
course
of
preparation
the
author
wrote
out
an
account
of
an
application
of
wireless
telegraphy
to
the
purpose
of
keeping
all
the
clocks
within
a
given
area
correct
to
one
standard
time
within
a
few
days
there
came
to
hand
a
copy
of
in
which
exactly
the
same
suggestion
was
put
forward
and
an
announcement
was
made
to
the
effect
that
richard
kerr
had
been
working
independently
on
the
same
lines
the
details
of
his
method
of
applying
the
hertzian
waves
to
the
purpose
being
practically
the
same
as
those
sketched
out
by
the
author
this
is
only
one
of
several
instances
of
coincidences
in
independent
work
which
have
been
noticed
during
the
period
while
this
volume
was
in
course
of
preparation
it
may
therefore
be
readily
understood
that
the
author
would
hardly
like
to
undertake
the
task
of
attempting
to
discriminate
between
those
forecasts
in
the
subsequent
pages
which
are
the
results
of
his
own
original
suggestions
and
those
which
have
been
derived
from
other
sources
whatever
is
of
value
has
in
all
probability
been
thought
of
or
perhaps
patented
and
otherwise
publicly
suggested
before
at
any
rate
the
great
majority
of
the
forecasts
are
based
on
actual
records
of
the
trials
of
inventions
which
distinctly
have
a
future
lying
before
them
in
the
years
of
the
twentieth
century
in
declining
to
enter
into
questions
relating
to
the
original
authorship
of
the
improvements
or
discoveries
discussed
it
should
not
be
supposed
that
any
wish
is
implied
to
detract
from
the
merits
of
inventors
and
promoters
of
inventions
either
individually
or
collectively
many
of
these
are
the
heroes
and
statesmen
of
that
great
nation
which
is
gradually
coming
to
be
recognised
as
a
true
entity
under
the
name
of
civilisation
their
life
work
is
to
elevate
humanity
and
if
mankind
paid
more
attention
to
them
and
to
what
they
are
thinking
and
doing
instead
of
setting
so
much
store
by
the
veriest
of
what
is
called
political
life
it
would
make
much
faster
progress
some
of
the
industrial
improvements
referred
to
in
the
succeeding
pages
are
necessarily
sketched
in
an
indefinite
manner
the
outlines
as
it
were
have
been
only
roughed
in
and
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
supply
particulars
which
in
fact
would
be
out
of
place
in
an
essay
towards
a
comprehensive
survey
in
so
small
a
space
it
is
upon
the
wise
and
skilful
arrangement
of
details
that
sound
and
commercially
profitable
patents
are
usually
founded
rather
than
upon
the
broad
general
principles
of
a
proposed
industrial
advance
or
reform
during
the
twentieth
century
this
latter
fact
already
well
recognised
by
experts
in
what
is
known
as
industrial
property
will
doubtless
force
itself
more
and
more
upon
the
attention
of
inventors
every
specification
will
require
to
be
drawn
up
with
the
very
greatest
care
in
observing
the
truth
taught
by
the
fable
of
the
boy
and
the
jar
of
nuts
so
rapidly
does
the
mass
of
bygone
patent
records
accumulate
that
almost
any
kind
of
claim
based
upon
very
wide
foundations
will
be
found
to
have
trenched
upon
ground
already
in
some
degree
taken
up
probably
there
is
hardly
anything
indicated
in
this
work
which
is
not
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
rules
laid
down
for
examiners
in
those
countries
which
make
search
as
to
originality
common
public
property
the
labour
involved
in
gathering
the
data
for
a
forecast
of
the
inventions
likely
to
produce
important
effects
during
the
twentieth
century
has
been
chiefly
that
of
selecting
from
out
of
a
vast
mass
of
heterogeneous
ideas
those
which
give
promise
of
springing
up
amidst
favourable
conditions
and
of
growing
to
large
proportions
and
bearing
valuable
fruit
such
ideas
when
planted
in
the
soil
of
the
collective
mind
through
the
medium
of
official
or
other
records
generally
require
for
their
germination
a
longer
time
than
that
for
which
the
patent
laws
grant
protection
for
industrial
property
many
of
them
indeed
have
formed
the
subjects
of
patents
which
from
one
reason
or
another
lapsed
long
before
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
terms
nature
is
ever
prodigal
of
seeds
and
of
but
comparatively
niggardly
of
places
in
which
the
young
plant
will
find
exactly
the
kind
of
soil
air
rain
and
sunshine
which
the
young
plant
needs
if
any
one
requires
proof
of
this
statement
he
will
find
ample
evidence
in
support
of
it
in
the
tenth
chapter
of
smiles
work
on
where
facts
and
dates
are
adduced
to
show
that
steam
locomotion
reaping
machines
balloons
gunpowder
macadamised
roads
coal
gas
photography
anæsthesia
and
even
telegraphy
are
inventions
which
so
far
as
concerns
the
germ
idea
on
which
their
success
has
been
based
are
of
very
much
older
origin
than
the
world
generally
supposes
the
author
therefore
submits
that
he
is
justified
in
referring
inventions
to
the
century
in
which
they
produce
successful
results
not
to
that
in
which
they
may
have
been
first
vaguely
thought
of
and
in
this
view
it
is
obvious
that
many
of
those
patents
and
suggestions
which
have
been
published
in
current
literature
during
the
nineteenth
century
but
which
although
pregnant
with
mighty
industrial
influences
have
not
yet
reached
fruition
are
essentially
inventions
of
the
twentieth
century
more
than
this
it
is
extremely
probable
that
the
great
majority
of
those
ideas
which
will
move
the
industrial
world
during
the
next
ensuing
hundred
years
have
already
been
indicated
more
or
less
clearly
by
the
inventive
thought
of
the
nineteenth
century

inventive
progress
the
year
the
first
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
in
the
industrial
history
of
mankind
it
was
in
that
year
that
the
railway
locomotive
was
invented
by
richard
trevithick
who
had
studied
the
steam
engine
under
a
friend
and
assistant
of
james
watt
his
patent
which
was
secured
during
the
ensuing
year
makes
distinct
mention
of
the
use
of
his
locomotive
driven
by
steam
upon
tramways
and
in
he
actually
had
an
engine
running
on
the
mining
tramway
in
cornwall
from
that
small
beginning
has
grown
a
system
of
railway
communication
which
has
brought
the
farthest
inland
regions
of
mighty
continents
within
easy
reach
of
the
seaboard
and
of
the
world
great
markets
which
has
made
social
and
friendly
intercourse
possible
in
millions
of
homes
which
otherwise
would
have
been
almost
destitute
of
it
which
has
been
the
means
of
spreading
a
knowledge
of
literature
science
and
religion
over
the
face
of
the
civilised
world
and
which
at
the
present
moment
constitutes
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
the
difference
between
western
civilisation
and
that
of
the
asiatic
as
seen
in
china
in
another
corner
of
the
globe
during
the
year
volta
was
constructing
his
first
apparatus
demonstrating
the
material
and
physical
nature
of
those
mysterious
electric
currents
which
his
friend
professor
galvani
of
bologna
who
died
just
two
years
earlier
had
at
first
ascribed
to
a
physiological
source
the
researches
of
the
latter
it
will
be
remembered
were
begun
in
an
observation
of
the
way
in
which
the
legs
of
a
dead
frog
twitched
under
certain
conditions
the
voltaic
pile
was
the
first
electric
battery
and
therefore
the
parent
of
the
existing
marvellous
telegraphic
and
telephonic
systems
while
less
immediately
it
led
to
the
development
of
the
dynamo
and
its
work
in
electric
lighting
and
traction
it
brought
into
harmony
much
fragmentary
knowledge
which
had
lain
disjointed
in
the
armoury
of
the
physicist
since
dufay
in
france
and
franklin
in
america
had
investigated
their
theories
of
positive
and
negative
frictional
electricities
and
had
connected
them
with
the
flash
of
lightning
as
seen
in
nature
thus
it
became
a
fresh
starting
point
both
for
industry
and
for
science
at
the
exposition
of
national
industry
held
in
paris
during
the
year
a
working
model
of
the
jacquard
loom
was
exhibited
the
prototype
of
those
remarkable
pieces
of
mechanism
by
which
the
most
elaborately
figured
designs
are
worked
upon
fabrics
during
the
process
of
weaving
by
means
of
sets
of
perforated
cardboards
this
was
the
crowning
achievement
of
the
inventions
relating
to
textile
fabrics
which
had
rendered
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
so
noteworthy
in
an
industrial
sense
it
brought
artistic
designs
in
articles
of
common
use
within
the
reach
of
even
poor
people
and
has
been
the
means
of
unconsciously
improving
the
public
taste
in
matters
of
applied
art
more
rapidly
than
could
have
been
accomplished
by
an
army
of
trained
artists
the
riots
in
which
the
mob
nearly
drowned
jacquard
at
lyons
for
attempting
to
set
up
some
of
his
looms
were
very
nearly
a
counterpart
of
those
which
had
occurred
in
england
in
connection
with
the
introduction
of
spinning
weaving
and
knitting
machinery
in
paris
during
the
first
year
of
the
nineteenth
century
robert
fulton
an
american
and
friend
of
the
united
states
representative
in
france
was
making
trials
on
the
seine
with
his
first
a
little
vessel
imitated
by
him
later
on
in
the
first
successful
steamers
which
plied
on
the
river
hudson
carrying
passengers
from
new
york
at
the
same
time
william
symongton
launched
the
the
steam
which
on
the
scottish
canals
did
the
first
actually
useful
work
in
the
conveyance
of
goods
by
steam
power
on
the
water
these
small
experiments
have
initiated
a
movement
in
maritime
transport
which
is
fully
comparable
to
that
brought
about
on
land
by
the
invention
of
the
railway
locomotive
again
in
sir
humphry
davy
gave
his
first
lecture
at
the
royal
institution
in
london
where
he
had
just
been
installed
as
a
professor
and
began
that
long
series
of
investigations
into
the
chemistry
of
common
things
which
taken
up
by
his
successor
faraday
gave
to
the
united
kingdom
the
first
start
in
some
of
those
industries
depending
upon
a
knowledge
of
organic
chemistry
and
the
use
of
certain
essential
oils
public
attention
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
however
was
directed
anywhere
but
towards
these
small
commencements
of
mighty
forces
which
were
to
revolutionise
the
industrial
world
and
through
it
also
the
social
and
political
if
in
those
days
cornwall
was
ever
referred
to
it
was
not
by
any
means
in
connection
with
trevithick
and
his
which
would
run
on
rails
but
by
way
of
reference
to
the
relations
of
the
prince
of
wales
to
the
duchy
and
the
proportion
of
its
revenues
which
belonged
to
him
from
birth
glancing
over
the
pages
of
any
history
compiled
in
the
early
half
of
the
century
the
eye
will
trace
hardly
the
barest
allusions
to
forces
the
discoveries
in
which
were
in
the
year
still
in
the
incipient
stage
canon
hughes
for
instance
in
his
continuation
of
the
histories
of
hume
and
smollett
devoted
some
forty
pages
to
the
record
of
that
year
the
space
which
he
could
spare
from
the
demands
made
upon
his
attention
by
the
wars
in
spain
and
egypt
and
the
naval
conflict
with
france
was
mainly
occupied
with
such
matters
as
the
election
of
the
rev
horne
tooke
for
old
sarum
and
the
burning
question
as
to
whether
that
gentleman
had
not
rendered
himself
permanently
ineligible
for
parliamentary
honours
through
taking
holy
orders
and
with
a
miscellaneous
mass
of
topics
relating
to
the
merely
evanescent
politics
of
the
day
the
whole
of
the
effects
of
invention
and
discovery
in
making
history
during
the
first
year
of
the
century
were
dismissed
by
this
writer
with
a
casual
reference
to
the
augmentation
of
the
productive
power
of
the
labouring
population
through
the
use
of
machinery
and
a
footnote
stating
that
this
was
more
particularly
the
case
in
the
cotton
manufacture
time
corrects
the
historical
perspective
of
the
past
but
it
does
not
very
materially
alter
the
power
of
the
historical
vision
to
adjust
itself
to
an
examination
of
the
present
day
forces
which
are
likely
to
grow
to
importance
in
the
making
of
future
history
when
we
ask
what
are
the
inventions
and
discoveries
which
are
really
destined
to
grow
from
seeds
of
the
nineteenth
into
trees
of
the
twentieth
century
we
are
at
once
confronted
with
the
same
kind
of
difficulty
which
would
present
itself
to
one
who
standing
in
the
midst
of
an
ancient
forest
should
be
requested
to
indicate
in
what
spots
the
giants
of
the
next
generation
of
trees
might
be
expected
to
grow
the
company
promoter
labels
those
inventions
in
which
he
is
commercially
interested
as
the
affairs
which
will
grow
to
huge
dimensions
in
the
future
while
the
man
of
scientific
or
mechanical
bent
is
very
apt
to
predict
a
mighty
future
only
for
achievements
which
strike
him
as
being
peculiarly
brilliant
patent
experts
on
the
other
hand
when
asked
by
their
clients
to
state
candidly
what
class
of
inventions
may
be
relied
upon
to
bring
the
most
certain
returns
generally
reply
that
big
money
usually
comes
from
small
patents
in
other
words
an
invention
embodying
some
comparatively
trivial
but
yet
really
serviceable
improvement
on
a
very
widely
used
type
of
machine
or
a
little
bit
of
apparatus
which
in
some
small
degree
facilitates
some
well
known
process
or
a
fashionable
toy
or
puzzle
likely
to
have
a
good
run
for
a
season
or
two
and
then
a
moderate
sale
for
a
few
years
longer
these
are
the
things
to
be
recommended
to
an
inventor
whose
main
object
is
to
make
money
thus
the
most
qualified
experts
in
patent
law
and
practice
do
not
fail
to
disclose
this
fact
to
those
who
seek
their
professional
advice
in
a
spirit
as
the
great
majority
of
inventors
do
the
full
term
of
fourteen
years
in
the
united
kingdom
or
seventeen
in
the
united
states
may
be
a
ridiculously
long
period
for
which
to
grant
a
monopoly
to
the
inventor
of
some
ephemeral
toy
although
absolutely
inadequate
to
secure
the
just
reward
for
one
who
labours
for
many
years
to
perfect
an
invention
and
then
to
introduce
it
to
the
public
in
the
face
of
all
the
opposition
from
vested
interests
which
such
inventions
almost
invariably
meet
thus
the
fact
that
a
man
has
made
money
out
of
one
class
of
patents
may
not
be
any
safe
guide
at
all
to
arriving
at
a
due
estimate
of
his
ideas
on
industrial
improvements
of
greater
pith
and
moment
but
on
the
contrary
it
is
generally
exactly
the
reverse
the
law
offers
an
immense
premium
for
such
inventions
as
are
readily
introduced
and
the
inventor
who
has
made
it
his
business
to
take
advantage
of
this
fact
is
usually
one
of
the
last
men
from
whom
to
get
a
trustworthy
opinion
on
patents
of
a
different
class
of
the
patents
taken
out
during
the
latter
portion
of
the
nineteenth
century
many
undoubtedly
contain
the
germs
of
great
ideas
and
nevertheless
have
excited
comparatively
little
attention
from
business
men
or
from
the
general
public
it
was
so
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
history
is
only
repeating
itself
when
the
seeds
of
twentieth
century
industrial
movements
are
permitted
to
germinate
unseen
for
all
practical
purposes
each
invention
must
be
referred
to
the
age
in
which
it
actually
does
useful
work
in
the
service
of
mankind
thus
hero
of
alexandria
in
the
third
century
devised
a
water
fountain
worked
by
the
expansive
power
of
steam
from
time
to
time
during
the
succeeding
twenty
centuries
similar
pieces
of
apparatus
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
inquisitive
and
the
interest
of
the
learned
the
clever
and
eccentric
marquis
of
worcester
in
his
little
book
published
in
century
of
the
names
and
scantlings
of
generally
known
as
the
of
gave
an
account
of
one
application
of
the
power
of
steam
to
lift
water
which
he
had
worked
out
probably
on
a
scale
large
enough
to
have
become
of
practical
service
thomas
savery
and
denis
papin
both
of
them
men
of
high
attainments
and
great
ingenuity
made
important
improvements
before
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
yet
if
we
refer
to
the
question
as
to
the
proper
age
to
which
the
as
a
useful
invention
is
to
be
assigned
we
shall
unhesitatingly
speak
of
it
as
an
eighteenth
century
invention
and
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
savery
patent
for
the
first
pumping
engine
which
came
into
practical
use
was
dated
the
real
introduction
of
steam
as
a
factor
in
man
daily
work
was
effected
later
on
partly
by
savery
himself
and
partly
by
newcomen
and
above
all
by
james
watt
the
expiration
of
watt
vital
patent
occurred
in
and
he
himself
then
retired
from
the
active
supervision
of
his
engineering
business
having
virtually
finished
his
great
life
work
on
the
last
year
of
the
century
which
he
had
marked
for
all
time
by
the
efforts
of
his
genius
similarly
we
may
confidently
characterise
the
locomotive
engine
as
an
invention
belonging
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
although
tramways
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
were
ready
for
the
application
of
steam
transport
and
the
only
work
that
remained
to
be
accomplished
in
the
half
century
indicated
was
the
bringing
of
the
two
things
together
the
dynamo
as
a
factor
in
human
life
or
in
other
words
the
electric
current
as
a
form
of
energy
producing
power
and
light
is
an
invention
of
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
although
the
main
principles
upon
which
it
was
built
were
worked
out
prior
to
the
year
it
will
be
seen
in
the
course
of
the
subsequent
pages
that
portable
electric
power
has
as
yet
won
its
way
only
into
very
workshops
and
mines
and
that
the
means
by
which
it
will
be
applied
to
numerous
useful
purposes
in
the
field
the
road
and
the
house
will
be
distinctly
inventions
of
the
twentieth
century
similarly
the
has
not
really
been
placed
upon
the
ordinary
road
although
efforts
have
been
made
for
more
than
a
century
to
put
it
there
the
conception
of
a
road
locomotive
being
in
fact
an
earlier
one
than
that
of
an
engine
running
on
rails
steam
automobiles
and
traction
engines
are
still
confined
to
special
purposes
the
natures
of
which
prove
that
certain
elements
of
adaptability
are
still
lacking
in
order
to
render
them
universally
useful
as
are
the
locomotive
and
the
in
nearly
every
other
important
line
of
human
needs
and
desires
it
will
be
found
that
merely
tentative
efforts
have
been
made
by
ingenious
minds
resulting
in
inventions
of
greater
or
less
promise
many
of
the
finest
conceptions
which
have
necessarily
been
set
down
as
failures
have
missed
fulfilling
their
intended
missions
not
so
much
by
reason
of
inherent
weakness
as
through
the
want
of
accessory
circumstances
to
assist
them
as
in
biology
so
in
industrial
progress
the
definition
of
fitness
appended
to
the
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
must
have
reference
to
the
environment
a
foolish
law
or
public
prejudice
results
in
the
temporary
failure
of
a
great
invention
and
the
inventor
patent
succumbs
to
the
inexorable
operation
of
the
struggle
for
existence
yet
fortunately
for
mankind
if
not
for
the
individual
inventor
an
idea
does
not
suffer
extinction
as
the
penalty
for
in
the
struggle
the
beginning
of
creation
says
carlyle
is
light
and
the
kind
of
light
which
inventors
throw
upon
the
dark
problems
involving
industrial
progress
is
providentially
indestructible
twentieth
century
inventions
as
the
term
is
used
in
this
book
are
therefore
those
which
are
destined
to
fulfil
their
missions
during
the
ensuing
hundred
years
they
are
those
whose
light
will
not
only
exist
in
hidden
places
but
will
also
shine
abroad
to
help
and
to
bless
mankind
or
if
we
may
revert
to
the
former
figure
they
are
those
which
have
not
only
been
planted
in
the
seed
and
have
germinated
in
the
leaf
but
which
have
grown
to
goodly
proportions
so
that
none
may
dare
to
assert
that
they
have
been
planted
for
nought
a
man
age
is
the
age
in
which
he
does
his
work
rather
than
that
in
which
he
struggles
to
years
of
maturity
moore
and
byron
were
poets
of
the
nineteenth
century
although
the
one
had
attained
to
manhood
and
the
other
had
grown
from
poverty
to
inherit
a
peerage
before
the
new
century
dawned
the
prophetic
rôle
although
proverbially
an
unsafe
one
is
nevertheless
one
which
every
business
man
must
play
almost
every
day
of
his
life
the
merchant
the
manufacturer
the
publisher
the
director
the
manager
and
even
the
artist
must
perforce
stake
some
portion
of
his
success
in
life
upon
the
chance
of
his
forecast
as
to
the
success
of
a
particular
speculation
article
of
manufacture
or
artistic
conception
and
its
prospects
of
proving
as
attractive
or
remunerative
as
he
has
expected
it
to
be
the
successful
business
man
no
doubt
makes
his
plans
as
far
as
may
be
practicable
upon
the
system
indicated
by
the
humorist
who
advises
people
never
to
prophesy
unless
they
happen
to
know
but
the
nature
of
his
knowledge
is
almost
always
to
some
extent
removed
from
certainty
he
may
spend
much
time
in
laborious
searching
make
many
inquiries
from
persons
whom
he
believes
to
be
competent
to
advise
him
diligently
study
the
conditions
upon
which
the
problem
before
him
depends
in
short
he
may
take
every
reasonable
precaution
against
the
chances
of
failure
yet
in
spite
of
all
he
must
necessarily
incur
risks
and
so
it
is
with
regard
to
the
task
of
forecasting
the
trend
of
industrial
improvement
all
who
are
called
upon
to
lay
their
plans
for
a
number
of
years
beforehand
must
necessarily
be
deeply
interested
in
the
problems
relating
to
the
various
directions
which
the
course
of
that
improvement
may
possibly
take
meanwhile
their
estimates
of
the
future
although
based
upon
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
past
and
aided
by
naturally
clear
powers
of
insight
must
be
hypothetical
and
conditional
unfortunately
for
the
vast
majority
of
manufacturing
experts
the
thoroughness
with
which
they
have
mastered
the
details
of
one
particular
branch
of
industry
too
often
blinds
them
to
the
chances
of
change
arising
from
localities
beyond
their
own
restricted
fields
of
vision
the
merriment
occasioned
by
the
first
proposals
for
affixing
pneumatic
tyres
to
bicycles
may
be
cited
as
a
striking
instance
of
the
lack
of
forecasting
insight
displayed
by
very
many
of
those
who
are
best
entitled
to
pronounce
opinions
on
the
minutiae
of
their
particular
avocations
in
almost
every
bike
shop
and
factory
throughout
the
united
kingdom
and
america
the
suggestion
of
putting
an
hosepipe
around
each
wheel
of
the
machine
to
act
as
a
tyre
was
received
with
shouts
of
ridicule
railway
men
who
understood
the
wonderful
elasticity
imparted
by
air
to
pieces
of
mechanism
such
as
the
pneumatic
brake
were
not
by
any
means
so
much
inclined
to
laughter
but
naturally
for
the
most
part
they
deferred
to
the
rule
which
enjoins
every
man
to
stick
to
his
trade
the
rule
in
question
when
applied
to
the
task
of
estimating
the
worth
of
inventions
claiming
to
produce
revolutionary
effects
in
any
industry
is
necessarily
in
the
majority
of
cases
more
or
less
irrelevant
because
such
an
invention
should
be
regarded
not
so
much
as
a
proposed
in
an
old
trade
as
the
of
a
new

ideas
on
the
transport
of
passengers
and
goods
were
almost
unanimously
condemned
by
the
experts
of
his
day
who
were
engaged
in
that
line
of
business
on
points
relating
to
wheels
of
waggons
and
the
harness
of
horses
the
opinions
of
these
men
were
probably
worth
something
but
in
relation
to
steam
locomotives
carriages
and
trucks
running
upon
rails
their
judgment
was
not
merely
worthless
but
a
good
deal
worse
it
was
indeed
actually
misleading
because
based
on
a
pretence
of
knowledge
of
a
trade
which
was
to
be
called
into
existence
to
compete
with
their
own

ephesians

artificers
of
old
and
on
the
strength
of
their
expert
knowledge
in
the
making
of
idols
they
set
themselves
up
as
judges
of
systems
of
theology
and
morality
the
argument
although
based
on
subjectively
was
nevertheless
intended
to
carry
weight
even
among
persons
who
wished
to
judge
the
questions
in
dispute
according
to
their
merits
and
most
of
the
latter
were
only
too
ready
to
accept
the
implied
dictum
that
men
who
work
about
a
temple
must
be
experts
in
theology

principles
upon
which
royal
commissions
and
select
committees
are
sometimes
appointed
and
entrusted
with
the
onerous
duty
of
deciding
upon
industrial
problems
affecting
the
progress
of
trade
and
manufactures
in
the

involve
exactly
the
same
kind
of
fallacy
men
are
selected
to
pronounce
judgment
upon
the
proposals
of
their
rivals
in
trade
and
specialists
to
give
their
opinions
upon
projects
which
essentially
belong
to
the
border
lands
between
two
or
more
branches
of
industry
and
can
not
be
understood
by
persons
not
possessing
a
knowledge
of
both
yet
the
world
work
goes
on
apace
and
as
capital
is
accumulated
and
seeks
to
find
new
outlets
the
multiplication
of
industrial
projects
must
continue
in
spite
of
every
discouragement
this
process
will
go
on
at
a
rate
even
faster
than
that
which
was
exhibited
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
in
watching
the
course
of
advancement
the
world
must
take
count
of
ideas
rather
than
of
the
names
of
those
who
may
have
claims
to
rank
as
the
originators
of
ideas
while
for
purposes
of
convenience
history
labels
certain
great
inventive
movements
each
with
the
name
of
one
individual
who
has
contributed
largely
to
its
success
nothing
like
a
due
appraisement
of
the
services
rendered
by
other

ever
attempted
it
is
not
even
as
if
the

should
by
public
acclamation
receive
all
the
applause
for
a
successful
campaign
to
the
exclusion
of

generally
acted
as
forerunners

most
famous

have
borne

the

and

of
the

the
part
assigned
by
some
writers
in
the

to
the
influence
of
great
men
is
certainly
fully
justified
if
the
attribute
of
greatness
is
to
be
ascribed
only
to
those
whose
names
figure
in
current
histories
the
parts
performed
by
others

fate
it
may
have
been
to
have

unfavourable
environments

to
the
acclamation
of

world

a
matter
asks
reasonably
enough
under
the
circumstances

we
omit
to
honour
any
of
the
great
men
who
have
played
important
parts
in
an
industrial
movement
assigning
as
our
motive
the
difficulty
of
enumerating
so
many
names
for
the
encouragement
of
those
to
whom
the
ambition
for
fame
acts
as
a
great
stimulus
to
in
the
interests
of
human
progress
it
is
unavoidable
that
some
men
should
be
singled
out
and
made
heroes
while
the
much
more
numerous
class
of
those
who
have
also
done
great
work
but
who
have
not
been
quite
so
successful
must
pass
out
of
the
ken
of
all
excepting
the
few
who
possess
an
expert
knowledge
of
the
various
subjects
which
they
have
taken
in
hand
still
the
distortion
to
which
history
has
been
subjected
through
its
biographical
mode
of
treatment
must
always
be
reckoned
with
as
a
factor
of
possible
error
by
any
one
attempting
to
read
the
riddle
of
the
past
and
it
may
offer
a
still
more
dangerous
snare
to
one
who
tries
to
deduce
the
future
course
of
events
from
the
evidences
of
the
past
and
the
promises
which
they
hold
out
people
are
naturally
prone
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
world
progress
during
the
first
part
of
the
twentieth
century
depends
upon
the
future
work
of
those
inventors
and
industrial
promoters
whose
names
have
become
most
famous
during
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
but
this
personal
treatment
of
the
subject
will
be
found
to
be
in
the
last
degree
unsatisfactory
when
judged
in
the
light
both
of
past
experience
and
of
some
of
the
utterances
of
those
eminent
inventors
who
have
tried
to
forecast
the
future
in
their
own
particular
lines
of
research
if
therefore

we
shall

that
we
have
entered
upon
a
chapter
in
the
evolution
of
the
human
race
dealing
in

with
a
branch
of

we
see
certain
industrial
and
inventive
forces
at
work
producing
certain
initial
effects
but
plainly
as
yet
falling
immeasurably
short
of
an
entire
fulfilment
of
their
possibilities
setting
to
work
a
multitude
of
busy
brains
planning
and
arranging
and
gradually
preparing
the
minds
of
the
more
apathetic
portion
of

for
the

of

and
the
adoption
of
improved
methods
of

of
work
whither
is
it

tending

the

bring
about

the
belief
impressed
upon
the

mind
by

and
considerations
evoked
during
the
collection
of

for
this

is
that
the
march
of

is
only
just
beginning
and
that
the
twentieth
century
will
witness
a
far
greater
development
than
the
nineteenth
has
seen
the
great
majority
of
mankind
still
require
to
be
released
from
the
drudgery
of
irksome
physical
exertion
which
when

to
be

a
very
large

be
substituted
for
the
monotonous
manual

which
while
it
continues
generally
precludes
the
possibility
of
mental
improvement
hygienic

will
insist
more
strenuously
than
ever
upon
the
great
truth
that
in
order
to
be
really
serviceable
in
promoting
the
health
of
mind
and

physical
exertion
must
be
in
some
degree
exhilarating
and
the
bad
old
practice
of
all
work
and
no
play
which
was
based
upon
the
assumption
that
a
boy
can
get
as
much
good
out
of
chopping
wood
for
an
hour
as
out
of
a
bicycle
ride
or
a
game
of
cricket
will
be
relegated
to
the
limbo
of
exploded
fallacies
the
race
as
a
whole
will
be
athletic
in
the
same
sense
in
which
cultured
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
at
present
it
will
a
century
hence
offer
a
still
more
striking
contrast
to
the
existing
state
of
the
chinese
who
bandage
their
women
feet
in
order
to
show
that
they
are
high
born
and
never
needed
to
walk
or
to
exert
themselves
the
assumption
being
that
no
one
would
ever
move
a
muscle
unless
under
fear
of
the
lash
of
poverty
or
of
actual

emphatically
the

almost
entirely
unknown
to
the

and
of
bringing

into

and
willing
service
for
the
accomplishment
of

work
vaguely
and
loosely
it
is
often
asserted
that
the
age
of
steam
is
now
giving
place
to
that
of

but
these
two
can
not
yet
be
logically
placed
in

to

by
far
the
greater
proportion
of
the
electrical
energy
that
is
generated
owes
its
existence
primarily
to
the
and
to
other
forms
of
reciprocating
machinery
designed
to
utilise
the
expansive
power
of
vapours
or
gases
acting
in
a
similar
manner
to
steam
the
industrial
revolutions
of
the
coming
century
will
without
doubt
be
brought
about
very
largely
through
the
utilisation
of
waste
energy
in
the
service
of
mankind
waterfalls
after
being
very
largely
neglected
for
two
or
three
generations
are
now
commanding
attention
as
valuable
and
highly
profitable
sources
of
power
this
is
only
to
be
regarded
as
forming
the
small
beginning
of
a
movement
which
in
the
coming
century
will
acquire
strength
by
going
and
which
most
probably
will
in
less
than
a
hundred
years
have
produced
changes
in
the
industrial
world
comparable
to
those
brought
about
by
the
invention
of
the
lord
kelvin
in
the
year
briefly
but
very
significantly
classified
the
sources
of
power
available
to
man
under
the
five
primary
headings
of
tides
food
fuel
wind
and
rain
food
is
the
generator
of
animal
energy
fuel
that
of
the
power
obtained
from
steam
and
other
mechanical
expansive
engines
rain
as
it
falls
on
the
and
descends
in
long
lines
of
natural
force
to
the
sea
coasts
furnishes
power
to
the
while
wind
may
be
utilised
to
generate
mechanical
energy
through
the
agency
of
windmills
and
other
contrivances
the
tides
as
a
source
of
useful
power
have
hardly
yet
begun
to
make
their
influence
felt
and
indeed
the
possibility
of
largely
using
them
is
still
a
matter
of
doubt
the
relative
advantages
of
reclaiming
a
given
area
of
soil
for
purposes
of
cultivation
and
of
converting
the
same
land
into
a
tidal
basin
in
order
to
generate
power
through
the
inward
and
outward
flow
of
the
were
contrasted
by
lord
kelvin
in
the
statement
of
a
problem
as
follows
which
is
the
more
valuable
an
agricultural
area
of
forty
acres
or
an
available
source
of
energy
equal
to
one
hundred
the
data
for
the
solution
of
such
a
question
are
obviously
not
at
hand
unless
the
quality
of
the
land
its
relative
nearness
to
the
position
at
which
power
might
be
required
and
several
other
factors
in
its
economic
application
have
been
supplied
still
the
fact
remains
that
very
large
quantities
of
the
coastal
land
and
a
considerable
quantity
of
expensive
work
would
be
needed
for
the
generation
by
means
of
the
tides
of
any
really
material
quantity
of
power
it
is
strange
that
while
so
much
has
been
written
and
spoken
about
the
possibility
of
turning
the
energy
of
the
tides
to
account
for
power
in
the
service
of
man
comparatively
little
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
problem
of
similarly
utilising
the
which
goes
to
waste
in
such
inconceivably
huge
quantities
where
the
tidal
force
elevates
and
depresses
the
on
a
shore
through
a
vertical
distance
of
say
eight
feet
about
once
in
twelve
hours
the
waves
of
the
ocean
will
perform
the
same
work
during
moderate
weather
once
in
every
twelve
or
fifteen
seconds
it
is
true
that
the
moon
in
its
attraction
of
the
produces
a
vastly
greater
sum
total
of
effect
than
the
wind
does
in
raising
the
but
reckoning
only
that
part
of
the
ocean
energy
which
might
conceivably
be
made
available
for
service
it
is
safe
to
calculate
that
the
waves
offer
between
two
and
three
thousand
times
as
much
opportunity
for
the
capture
of
natural
power
and
its
application
to
useful
work
as
the
tides
could
ever
present
in
no
other
form
is
the
energy
of
the
wind
brought
forward
in
so
small
a
compass
or
in
so
concrete
a
form
a
of
tons
gross
weight
which
rises
and
falls
ten
times
per
minute
through
an
average
height
of
feet
is
thereby
subjected
to
an
influence
equal
to
in
this
estimate
the
unit
of
the
which
has
been
adopted
is
watt
arbitrary
standard
of
foot
pounds
per
minute
the
work
done
in
raising
the
vessel
referred
to
is
equal
to
ten
multiplied
by
the
number
of
pounds
in
a
ton
or
in
other
words
as
stated
again
has
been
to
a
large
extent
neglected
since
the
advent
of
the
the
mightiest
work
carried
out
in
any
european
country
in
the
early
part
of
the
present
century
was
that
which
the
dutch
people
most
efficiently
performed
in
the
draining
of
their
reclaimed
land
by
means
of
scores
of
windmills
erected
along
their
seaboard
even
to
the
present
day
there
are
no
examples
of
the
direct
employment
of
the
power
of
the
wind
which
can
be
placed
in
comparison
with
those
still
to
be
found
on
the
coasts
of
holland
but
unfortunately
for
the
last
generation
of
windmill
builders
the
intermittent
character
of
the
power
to
which
they
had
to
trust
completely
condemned
it
when
placed
in
competition
with
the
handy
and
always
convenient
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
but
only
at
such
times
and
seasons
as
it
listeth
and
its
vagaries
do
not
suit
an
employer
whose
wages
list
is
mounting
up
whether
he
has
his
men
fully
occupied
or
not
the
storage
of
power
was
the
great
thing
needful
to
enable
the
windmill
to
hold
its
own
the
electrical
storage
battery
compressed
air
and
other
agencies
which
will
be
referred
to
later
on
have
now
supplied
this
want
of
the
windmill
builder
but
in
the
meantime
his
trade
has
been
to
a
large
extent
destroyed
for
its
revival
there
is
no
doubt
that
as
lord
kelvin
remarked
in
the
address
already
quoted
the
little
thing
wanted
to
let
the
thing
be
done
is
cheap
windmills
this
however
leads
to
another
part
of
the
problem
the
costliness
of
the
best
modern
patterns
of
windmill
as
now
so
extensively
used
particularly
in
america
is
mainly
due
to
the
elaborate
and
on
the
whole
successful
attempts
at
minimising
the
objection
of
the
intermittent
nature
of
the
source
of
power
to
put
the
matter
in
another
way
it
may
be
said
that
lightness
and
sensitiveness
to
the
slightest
breeze
have
had
to
be
conjoined
with
an
eminent
degree
of
safety
in
the
severest
gale
so
that
the
most
complicated
mechanisms
have
been
rendered
absolutely
imperative
once
the
principle
of
storage
is
applied
the
whole
of
the
conditions
in
this
respect
are
revolutionised
there
is
no
need
to
attempt
the
construction
of
that
shall
run
lightly
in
a
soft
zephyr
of
only
five
or
six
miles
an
hour
and
stability
is
the
main
desideratum
to
be
looked
to
the
fixed
windmill
which
requires
no
swivel
mechanism
and
no
vane
to
keep
it
up
to
the
wind
is
the
cheapest
and
may
be
made
the
most
substantial
of
all
the
forms
of
in
its
rudimentary
shape
this
very
elementary
windmill
resembles
a
screw
propeller
the
wheel
may
be
constructed
by
simply
erecting
a
high
windlass
with
arms
bolted
to
the
barrel
at
each
end
making
the
shape
of
a
rectangular
cross
but
those
at
one
end
are
fixed
in
such
positions
that
when
viewed
from
the
side
they
bisect
the
angles
made
by
those
at
the
other
side
sails
of
canvas
or
galvanised
iron
are
then
fastened
to
the
arms
the
position
of
which
is
such
that
the
necessary
obliquity
to
the
line
of
the
barrel
is
secured
at
once
looking
at
this
elementary
and
at
one
time
very
popular
form
of
windmill
and
asking
ourselves
what
adaptation
its
general
principle
is
susceptible
of
in
order
that
it
may
be
usefully
employed
in
conjunction
with
a
storage
battery
we
find
at
the
outset
that
inasmuch
as
the
electric
generator
requires
a
high
speed
there
is
every
inducement
to
greatly
lengthen
the
barrel
and
at
the
same
time
to
make
the
arms
of
the
sails
shorter
because
short
sails
give
in
the
windmill
the
high
rate
of
speed
required
we
are
confronted
in
fact
with
the
same
kind
of
problem
which
met
the
constructors
of
turbine
designed
for
electric
lighting
the
object
was
to
get
an
initial
speed
which
would
be
so
great
as
to
admit
of
the
coupling
of
the
dynamo
to
the
revolving
shaft
of
the
turbine
without
the
employment
of
too
much
reducing
gear
in
the
case
of
the
the
eighteenth
century
miller
was
compelled
to
make
the
arms
of
his
mill
of
gigantic
length
so
that
while
the
centre
of
the
wind
pressure
on
each
arm
was
travelling
at
somewhere
near
to
the
rate
of
the
wind
the
axis
would
not
be
running
too
fast
and
the
mill
stones
would
never
be
grinding
so
rapidly
as
to
set
the
or
the
lighter
parts
of
the
corn
on
fire
the
dynamo
for
the
generation
of
the
electric
current
demands
exactly
the
opposite
class
of
conditions
we
may
therefore
surmise
that
the
windmill
of
the
future
as
constructed
for
the
purposes
of
storing
power
will
have
a
long
barrel
upon
which
will
be
set
numerous
very
short
blades
or
sails
reducing
this
again
to
its
most
convenient
form
it
is
plain
that
a
spiral
of
wound
round
the
barrel
will
offer
the
most
convenient
type
of
structure
for
stability
and
cheapness
combined
at
the
end
of
this
long
barrel
will
be
fixed
the
dynamo
the
armature
of
which
is
virtually
a
part
of
the
barrel
itself
while
the
magnets
are
placed
in
convenient
positions
on
the
supporting
uprights
from
the
generating
dynamo
the
current
is
conveyed
directly
to
the
storage
batteries
and
these
alone
work
the
electric
motor
which
if
desired
keeps
continually
in
motion
pumping
grinding
or
driving
any
suitable
class
of
machinery
it
is
rather
surprising
to
find
how
relatively
small
is
the
advantage
possessed
by
the
over
the
fixed
type
in
the
matter
of
continuity
of
working
during
about
two
years
the
author
conducted
a
series
of
experiments
with
the
object
of
determining
this
point
the
fixed
windmill
being
applied
to
work
which
rendered
it
a
matter
of
indifference
in
which
way
the
wheel
ran
with
the
prevailing
winds
from
the
west
it
ran
in
one
direction
and
with
those
of
next
degree
of
frequency
namely
from
the
east
it
turned
in
the
reverse
direction
the
mill
however
was
effective
although
the
breeze
might
veer
several
points
from
either
of
the
locations
mentioned
it
was
found
that
there
were
rather
less
than
of
the
points
of
the
compass
the
winds
from
which
would
bring
the
wheel
to
a
standstill
or
cause
it
to
swing
ineffectively
but
as
these
were
the
directions
in
which
the
wind
least
frequently
blew
it
might
safely
be
reckoned
that
not
of
the
possible
working
hours
of
a
were
really
lost
in
the
fixed
machine
with
the
type
adapted
to
the
working
of
a
dynamo
as
already
described
it
will
in
most
cases
be
convenient
to
construct
two
spirals
on
uprights
set
in
three
holes
in
the
ground
forming
lines
at
right
angles
to
each
other
but
both
engaging
by
suitable
gearing
with
the
electric
current
generator
situated
at
the
angle
this
will
be
found
cheaper
than
to
go
to
the
expense
of
constructing
the
mill
on
a
swivel
so
that
it
may
follow
the
direction
of
the
wind
at
the
same
time
it
should
be
noticed
that
the
adoption
of
the
high
speed
consisting
of
some
kind
of
spiral
on
a
very
long
axis
may
be
made
effective
for
improving
even
the
swivel
windmill
itself
so
as
to
adapt
it
for
electric
generation
and
conservation
of
power
through
the
medium
of
the
storage
battery
supposing
that
a
number
of
small
oblique
sails
be
set
upon
an
axis
lying
in
the
direction
of
the
wind
the
popular
conception
of
the
result
of
such
an
arrangement
is
that
the
foremost
sails
would
render
those
behind
it
almost
if
not
entirely
useless
the
analogy
followed
in
reaching
this
conclusion
is
that
of
the
sails
of
a
ship
but
as
applied
to
it
is
quite
misleading
because
not
more
than
or
of
the
energy
of
the
wind
is
expended
upon
the
oblique
sails
of
an
ordinary
moreover
in
the
case
of
a
number
of
such
wheels
set
on
a
long
axis
one
behind
the
other
as
described
the
space
within
which
the
shelter
of
the
front
sail
is
operative
to
keep
the
wind
from
driving
the
next
one
is
exceedingly
minute
the
elasticity
of
the
air
and
its
frictional
inertia
when
running
in
the
form
of
wind
cause
the
current
to
proceed
on
its
course
after
a
very
slight
check
which
in
point
of
time
is
momentary
and
in
its
effects
almost
infinitesimal
this
being
the
case
and
the
principal
expense
attendant
upon
the
construction
of
ordinary
being
due
to
the
need
for
providing
a
large
diameter
of
with
all
the
attendant
complications
required
to
secure
such
a
wheel
from
risk
it
is
obvious
that
as
soon
as
the
long
axis
and
the
very
short
sail
or
the
metallic
spiral
have
been
generally
introduced
as
adjuncts
to
the
dynamo
storage
battery
an
era
of
cheaper
will
have
been
entered
upon
in
fact
the
little
want
of
which
lord
kelvin
spoke
in
will
have
been
supplied
the
high
speed
which
the
dynamo
requires
and
the
more
rapid
rate
at
which
windmills
constructed
on
this
very
economical
principle
must
necessarily
run
both
mark
the
two
classes
of
apparatus
as
being
eminently
suited
for
mutual
assistance
in
future
usefulness
the
anemometer
of
the
robinson
type
having
four
little
hemispherical
cups
revolving
horizontally
furnishes
the
first
hint
of
another
principle
of
construction
adapted
to
the
generation
of
electricity
some
years
ago
a
professor
in
one
of
the
scottish
universities
set
up
a
windmill
which
was
simply
an
amplified
anemometer
and
connected
it
with
several
of
faure
storage
batteries
for
the
purpose
of
furnishing
the
electric
light
to
his
residence
his
report
regarding
his
experience
with
this
arrangement
showed
that
the
results
of
the
system
were
quite
satisfactory
in
this
particular
type
of
natural
motor
the
of
course
is
permanently
set
to
run
no
matter
from
what
direction
the
wind
may
be
blowing
tests
instituted
with
the
object
of
determining
the
pressure
which
the
wind
exerts
on
the
cup
of
a
robinson
anemometer
have
shown
that
when
the
breeze
blows
into
the
concave
side
of
the
cup
its
effect
is
rather
more
than
three
times
as
strong
as
when
it
blows
against
the
convex
side
at
any
given
time
the
principal
part
of
the
work
done
by
a
windmill
constructed
on
this
principle
is
being
carried
out
by
one
cup
which
has
its
concave
side
presented
to
the
wind
while
opposite
to
it
there
is
another
cup
travelling
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
of
the
wind
but
having
its
convex
side
opposed
the
facts
that
practically
only
one
sail
of
the
mill
is
operative
at
any
given
time
and
that
even
the
work
which
is
done
by
this
must
be
diminished
by
nearly
owing
to
the
opposing
pull
of
the
cup
at
the
opposite
side
no
doubt
must
detract
from
the
merits
of
such
a
judged
simply
on
the
basis
of
actual
area
of
sail
employed
but
when
the
matter
of
cost
alone
is
taken
as
the
standard
the
advantages
are
much
more
evenly
balanced
than
they
might
at
first
sight
seem
to
be
the
sail
may
be
greatly
improved
upon
for
purposes
by
adopting
a
sail
having
a
section
not
semicircular
but
triangular
in
shape
and
by
extending
its
length
in
the
vertical
direction
to
a
very
considerable
extent
practically
this
cheap
and
efficient
then
becomes
a
square
or
hexagonal
upright
axis
of
fairly
large
section
to
each
side
of
which
is
secured
a
board
or
a
rigid
sail
projecting
beyond
the
corners
the
side
of
the
axis
and
the
projecting
portion
of
the
sail
then
together
form
the
triangular
section
required
for
the
sake
of
safety
in
time
of
storm
an
opening
may
be
left
at
the
apex
of
the
angle
which
is
closed
by
a
door
kept
shut
through
the
tension
of
a
spring
when
the
wind
rises
to
such
a
speed
as
to
overbalance
the
force
of
the
spring
each
door
opens
and
lets
the
blast
pass
through
one
collateral
advantage
of
this
type
of
windmill
is
that
it
may
be
made
to
act
virtually
as
its
own
stand
the
only
necessity
in
its
erection
being
that
it
should
have
a
collar
fitting
round
the
topmost
bearing
which
collar
is
fastened
by
four
strong
steel
ropes
to
stakes
securely
set
in
the
ground
the
dynamo
is
then
placed
at
the
lower
bearing
and
protected
from
the
weather
by
a
metal
shield
through
which
the
shaft
of
the
axis
passes
for
pumping
and
for
other
simple
purposes
apart
from
the
use
of
the
dynamo
a
ready
application
of
this
form
of
with
a
minimum
of
intricacy
or
expense
may
be
worked
out
by
setting
the
lower
bearing
in
a
round
tank
of
water
kept
in
circular
motion
by
a
set
of
small
paddles
working
horizontally
into
the
water
a
dips
carrying
on
its
shaft
a
crank
which
directly
drives
the
pump
this
simple
is
particularly
safe
in
a
storm
because
on
attaining
a
high
speed
it
merely
smashes
the
water
in
the
tank
solar
heat
is
one
of
the
principal
sources
of
the
energy
to
be
derived
from
the
wind
several
very
determined
and
ingenious
attempts
at
the
utilisation
of
the
heat
of
sunshine
for
the
driving
of
a
motor
have
been
made
during
the
past
century
as
a
solution
of
a
mechanical
and
physical
puzzle
the
arrangement
of
a
large
reflector
with
a
small
at
the
focus
of
the
heat
rays
thrown
by
it
is
full
of
interest
yet
when
a
man
like
the
late
john
ericsson
who
did
so
much
to
improve
the
caloric
engine
and
the
as
applied
to
purposes
meets
with
failure
in
the
attempt
to
carry
such
an
idea
to
a
commercially
successful
issue
there
is
at
least
evidence
of
some
obstacle
which
places
the
proposed
machine
at
a
disadvantage
in
competition
with
its
rivals
the
solar
engine
if
generally
introduced
would
be
found
more
intermittent
in
its
action
than
the
windmill
excepting
perhaps
in
a
very
few
localities
where
there
is
a
cloudless
sky
throughout
the
year
the
windmill
gathers
up
the
power
generated
by
the
expansion
of
the
air
in
passing
over
long
stretches
of
heated
ground
while
a
solar
engine
can
not
command
more
of
the
sun
heat
than
that
which
falls
upon
the
reflector
or
condenser
of
the
engine
itself
the
latter
machine
may
possibly
have
a
place
assigned
to
it
in
the
industrial
economy
of
the
future
but
the
sum
total
of
the
power
which
it
will
furnish
must
always
be
an
insignificant
fraction
the
machine
when
allied
to
electric
transmission
will
without
doubt
supply
in
a
cheap
and
convenient
form
a
material
proportion
of
the
energy
required
during
the
twentieth
century
for
industrial
purposes
easy
and
effective
transmission
is
a
quâ
in
this
case
just
as
it
is
in
the
utilisation
of
waterfalls
situated
far
from
the
busy
mart
and
factory
hardly
any
natural
source
of
power
presents
so
near
an
approach
to
constancy
as
the
ocean
billows
shakespeare
takes
as
his
emblem
of
perpetual
motion
the
dancing
waves
o
th
sea
but
the
ocean
coasts
where
alone
natural
is
constant
are
exactly
the
localities
at
which
as
a
rule
it
is
the
least
practicable
to
build
up
a
manufacturing
trade
commerce
needs
smooth
water
for
the
havens
offered
to
its
ships
and
inasmuch
as
this
requirement
is
vastly
more
imperative
during
the
early
stages
of
civilisation
than
cheap
power
the
drift
of
manufacturing
centres
has
been
all
towards
the
calm
harbours
and
away
from
the
ocean
coasts
but
electrical
transmission
in
this
connection
abolishes
space
and
can
bring
to
the
service
of
man
the
power
of
the
thundering
wave
just
as
it
can
that
of
the
roaring
torrent
or
waterfall
the
simplest
form
of
may
be
suggested
by
the
force
exerted
by
a
ferry
boat
or
dinghy
tied
up
to
a
pier
the
pull
exerted
by
the
rope
is
equal
to
the
inertia
of
the
boat
as
it
falls
into
the
trough
of
each
wave
successively
and
the
amount
of
strain
involved
in
rough
weather
may
be
estimated
from
the
thickness
of
the
rope
that
is
generally
found
necessary
for
the
security
of
even
very
small
craft
indeed
a
similar
suggestion
is
conveyed
by
the
need
for
elaborate
fenders
to
break
the
force
of
the
shock
when
a
barge
is
lying
alongside
of
a
steamer
or
when
any
other
vessel
is
ranging
along
a
pier
or
jetty
a
buoy
of
large
size
moored
in
position
at
a
convenient
distance
from
a
ocean
coast
will
supply
the
first
idea
of
a
on
this
primary
principle
as
adapted
for
the
generation
of
power
on
the
cliff
a
high
derrick
is
erected
over
a
pulley
or
wheel
on
the
top
of
this
there
is
passed
a
cable
fastened
on
the
seaward
side
to
the
buoy
and
on
the
landward
side
to
the
machinery
in
the
the
whole
arrangement
in
fact
is
very
similar
in
appearance
to
the
and
surface
buildings
that
may
be
seen
at
any
mine
the
difference
in
principle
of
course
is
that
while
on
a
mine
the
is
supplying
power
to
the
other
side
of
the
derrick
the
relations
are
reversed
in
the
the
energy
being
passed
from
the
sea
across
into
the
the
reciprocating
or
backward
and
forward
movement
imparted
to
the
cable
by
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
buoy
now
requires
to
be
converted
into
a
force
exerted
in
one
direction
in
the
and
in
other
machines
of
similar
type
the
problem
is
simplified
by
the
uniform
length
of
the
stroke
made
by
the
piston
so
that
devices
such
as
the
crank
and
eccentric
circular
discs
are
readily
applicable
to
the
securing
of
a
rotatory
motion
for
a
from
a
reciprocating
motion
in
the
cylinders
in
the
application
of
provision
must
be
made
for
the
utilisation
of
the
force
derived
from
movements
of
as
well
as
of
in
the
force
of
impact
every
movement
of
the
buoy
which
imparts
motion
to
the
pulley
on
top
of
the
derrick
must
be
converted
into
an
additional
impetus
to
a
always
running
in
the
same
direction
the
and
ratchet
as
at
present
largely
used
in
machinery
offer
a
rough
and
ready
means
of
solving
this
problem
but
two
very
important
improvements
must
be
effected
before
full
advantage
can
be
taken
of
the
principle
involved
in
the
first
place
it
is
obvious
that
if
a
ratchet
runs
freely
in
one
direction
and
only
catches
on
the
tooth
of
the
when
it
is
drawn
in
the
other
the
power
developed
and
used
is
concentrated
on
one
stroke
when
it
might
with
greater
advantage
be
divided
between
the
two
and
in
the
second
place
the
shock
occasioned
by
the
striking
of
the
ratchet
against
the
tooth
when
it
just
misses
catching
one
of
the
teeth
and
is
then
forced
along
the
whole
length
of
the
tooth
gathering
energy
as
it
goes
must
add
greatly
to
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
machinery
and
to
the
unevenness
of
the
running
taking
the
first
of
these
difficulties
into
consideration
it
is
obvious
that
by
means
of
a
counterbalancing
weight
about
equal
to
half
that
of
the
buoy
it
is
possible
to
cause
the
to
operate
two
ratchets
one
doing
work
when
the
pull
is
to
landwards
and
the
other
when
it
is
to
seawards
each
however
must
be
set
to
catch
the
teeth
of
its
own
separate
and
inasmuch
as
the
direction
of
the
motion
in
one
case
is
different
from
what
it
is
in
the
other
it
is
necessary
that
by
means
of
an
intervening
toothed
wheel
the
motion
of
one
of
these
should
be
reversed
before
it
is
communicated
to
the
the
latter
is
thus
driven
always
in
the
same
direction
both
by
the
inward
and
by
the
outward
stroke
or
pull
of
the
cable
from
the
buoy
perhaps
the
most
convenient
development
of
the
system
is
that
in
which
the
is
driven
by
two
vertically
pendant
toothed
bands
resembling
saws
and
of
sufficient
length
to
provide
for
the
greatest
possible
amplitude
of
movement
that
could
be
imparted
to
them
by
the
motion
of
the
buoy
the
teeth
are
set
to
engage
in
those
of
the
one
band
on
each
side
so
that
the
effective
stroke
in
one
case
is
downward
while
in
the
other
it
is
upward
these
toothed
bands
are
drawn
together
at
their
lower
ends
by
a
spring
and
they
are
also
kept
under
downward
tension
by
weights
or
a
powerful
spring
beneath
the
effect
of
this
is
that
when
both
are
drawn
up
and
down
the
goes
round
with
a
continuous
motion
because
at
every
stroke
the
teeth
of
one
band
engage
in
the
wheel
and
control
it
while
those
of
the
reversed
one
at
the
other
side
slip
quite
freely
the
shock
occasioned
by
the
blow
of
the
ratchet
on
the
or
of
one
tooth
upon
another
may
be
reduced
almost
to
vanishing
point
by
multiplying
the
number
of
ratchets
or
toothed
bands
and
placing
the
effective
ends
which
engage
in
the
teeth
of
the
wheel
successively
one
very
slightly
in
advance
of
the
other
in
this
way
the
machine
is
so
arranged
that
no
matter
at
what
point
the
stroke
imparted
by
the
movement
of
the
buoy
may
be
arrested
there
is
always
one
or
other
of
the
ratchets
or
of
the
teeth
which
will
fall
into
engagement
with
the
tooth
of
the
very
close
to
its
effective
face
and
thus
the
momentum
acquired
by
the
one
part
before
it
impinges
upon
the
other
becomes
comparatively
small
the
limit
to
which
it
may
be
practicable
to
multiply
ratchets
or
toothed
bands
will
of
course
depend
upon
the
thickness
of
the
and
when
this
latter
has
been
greatly
enlarged
with
the
object
of
providing
for
this
feature
it
becomes
virtually
a
steel
drum
having
bevelled
steps
accurately
cut
longitudinally
upon
its
periphery
the
masts
of
a
ship
tend
to
assume
a
position
at
right
angles
to
the
when
the
waves
catch
the
vessel
on
the
beam
the
greatest
degree
of
pendulous
swing
is
brought
about
in
a
series
of
waves
so
timed
and
of
such
a
length
that
the
duration
of
the
swing
coincides
with
the
period
required
for
one
wave
to
succeed
another
the
increasing
slope
of
the
ship
decks
due
to
the
inertia
of
this
continuous
rhythmical
motion
often
amounts
to
far
more
than
the
angle
made
by
the
declivity
of
the
wave
as
compared
with
the
sea
level
and
it
is
of
course
a
source
of
serious
danger
in
the
eyes
of
the
mariner
but
for
the
purposes
of
the
mechanician
who
desires
to
secure
power
from
the
waves
the
problem
is
not
how
to
avoid
a
pendulous
motion
but
how
to
increase
it
for
each
locality
in
which
any
large
plant
of
machinery
is
to
be
installed
it
will
therefore
be
advisable
to
study
the
characteristic
length
of
the
wave
which
as
observation
has
proved
is
shorter
in
confined
seas
than
in
those
fully
open
to
the
ocean
it
is
advisable
then
to
make
the
beam
width
of
the
buoy
no
matter
how
it
may
be
turned
of
such
a
length
that
when
one
side
is
well
in
the
trough
of
a
wave
the
other
must
be
not
far
from
the
crest
practically
the
best
design
for
such
a
floating
will
be
one
in
which
four
buoys
are
placed
each
of
them
at
the
end
of
one
arm
of
a
cross
which
has
been
braced
up
very
firmly
from
the
angle
of
intersection
projects
a
vertical
mast
also
firmly
held
by
stays
or
guys
the
whole
must
be
anchored
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
by
attachment
to
a
large
cemented
block
or
other
heavy
weight
having
a
ring
let
into
it
from
which
is
attached
a
chain
of
a
few
links
connecting
with
an
upright
beam
it
is
the
continuation
of
the
latter
above
which
forms
the
mast
on
this
beam
the
framework
of
the
buoy
must
be
free
to
move
up
and
down
at
first
sight
it
might
seem
as
if
this
arrangement
rendered
nugatory
the
attempt
to
take
advantage
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
buoy
but
it
is
not
so
when
the
relations
of
the
four
buoys
to
one
another
are
considered
although
the
frame
is
free
to
move
up
and
down
upon
the
uprising
shaft
still
its
inclination
to
the
vertical
is
determined
by
the
direction
of
the
line
drawn
from
a
buoy
in
the
trough
of
a
wave
to
one
on
the
crest
in
order
to
facilitate
the
free
movement
and
to
render
the
rocking
effect
more
accurate
and
free
from
vibration
sets
of
wheels
running
on
rails
fixed
to
the
beam
are
of
considerable
advantage
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
tides
render
necessary
the
adoption
of
some
such
compensating
device
as
that
which
has
been
indicated
of
course
it
would
be
possible
to
provide
for
utilising
the
force
generated
by
a
buoy
simply
moored
direct
to
a
ring
at
the
bottom
by
means
of
a
common
chain
cable
but
this
latter
would
require
to
be
of
a
length
sufficient
to
provide
for
the
highest
possible
wave
on
the
top
of
the
highest
tide
then
again
the
loose
chain
at
low
tide
would
permit
the
buoy
to
drift
abroad
within
a
very
considerable
area
of
sea
surface
and
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
rise
and
fall
on
each
wave
it
would
be
essential
to
provide
at
the
derrick
on
the
shore
end
of
the
plant
very
long
toothed
bands
or
equivalent
devices
on
a
similarly
enlarged
scale
by
providing
three
or
four
chains
and
moorings
meeting
in
a
centre
at
the
buoy
itself
but
fastened
to
rings
secured
to
weights
at
the
bottom
at
a
considerable
distance
apart
the
lateral
movement
might
no
doubt
be
minimised
and
for
very
simple
installations
this
plan
associated
with
the
device
of
taking
a
cable
from
the
buoy
and
turning
it
several
times
round
a
drum
on
shore
could
be
used
to
furnish
a
convenient
source
of
cheap
power
the
drum
may
carry
a
crank
and
shaft
which
works
the
and
toothed
bands
as
already
described
so
that
no
matter
at
what
stage
in
the
revolution
of
the
drum
an
upward
or
downward
stroke
may
be
stopped
the
motion
will
still
be
communicated
in
a
continuous
rotary
form
to
the
but
the
beam
and
sliding
frame
with
buoys
give
the
best
practical
results
especially
for
large
installations
it
is
in
some
instances
advisable
especially
where
the
depth
of
the
water
at
a
convenient
distance
from
the
shore
is
very
considerable
not
to
provide
a
single
beam
reaching
the
whole
distance
to
the
bottom
but
to
anchor
an
tank
below
the
surface
and
well
beneath
the
depth
at
which
wave
disturbance
is
ever
felt
from
this
submerged
tank
which
approximately
keeps
a
steady
position
in
all
tides
and
weathers
the
upward
beam
is
attached
by
a
ring
just
as
would
be
done
if
the
tank
itself
constituted
the
bottom
one
main
reason
for
this
arrangement
is
that
the
resistance
of
the
beam
to
the
water
as
it
rocks
backwards
and
forwards
wastes
to
some
extent
the
power
generated
by
the
force
of
the
waves
and
the
greater
the
length
of
the
beam
the
longer
must
be
the
distance
through
which
it
has
to
travel
when
the
buoys
draw
it
into
positions
vertical
to
that
of
the
framework
a
thin
steel
pipe
offers
less
resistance
than
a
wooden
beam
of
equal
strength
besides
facilitating
the
use
of
a
simple
device
for
enabling
the
frame
and
buoys
to
slide
easily
up
and
down
the
generally
fatal
defect
of
those
inventions
which
have
been
designed
in
the
past
with
the
object
of
utilising
has
arisen
from
the
mistake
of
placing
too
much
of
the
machinery
in
the
sea
the
device
of
erecting
in
the
water
an
adjustable
reservoir
to
catch
the
wave
crests
and
to
use
the
power
derived
from
them
as
the
water
escaped
through
a
was
patented
in
nearly
twenty
years
later
another
scheme
was
brought
out
depending
upon
the
working
of
a
large
pump
fixed
far
under
the
surface
and
connected
with
the
shore
so
that
when
operated
by
the
rising
and
falling
of
floats
upon
the
waves
it
would
drive
a
supply
of
water
into
an
elevated
reservoir
on
shore
from
which
on
escaping
down
the
cliff
the
pressure
of
the
water
would
be
utilised
to
work
a
turbine
earlier
devices
included
the
building
of
a
mill
upon
a
rocking
barge
having
weights
and
pulleys
adjusted
to
run
the
machinery
on
board
and
also
a
revolving
float
so
constructed
that
each
successive
wave
would
turn
one
portion
but
the
latter
would
then
be
held
firm
by
a
toothed
wheel
and
ratchet
until
another
impulse
would
be
given
to
it
in
the
same
direction
this
plan
included
certain
elements
of
the
simple
system
already
described
but
it
is
obvious
that
some
of
its
floating
parts
might
with
advantage
have
been
removed
to
the
shore
end
where
they
would
not
only
be
available
for
ready
inspection
and
adjustment
but
also
be
out
of
harm
way
in
rough
weather
different
as
already
explained
correspond
to
various
periods
in
the
pendulous
swing
of
floating
bodies
examples
have
been
cited
by
vaughan
cornish
m
in
march
as
follows
a
of
fifty
feet
corresponds
to
a
period
of
two
and
a
half
seconds
while
one
of
feet
corresponds
to
five
and
a
half
seconds
it
is
mentioned
that
the
swing
of
the
took
six
seconds
other
authorities
state
that
during
a
storm
in
the
atlantic
the
velocity
of
the
wave
was
determined
to
be
miles
an
hour
and
that
nine
or
ten
waves
were
included
in
each
mile
thus
about
five
would
pass
in
each
minute
but
in
average
weather
the
number
of
waves
to
the
mile
is
considerably
larger
say
from
fifteen
to
twenty
to
the
mile
and
in
nearly
calm
days
about
double
those
numbers
one
interesting
fact
which
gives
to
a
peculiarly
enhanced
value
as
a
source
of
stored
is
that
the
surface
of
the
ocean
wild
as
it
may
at
times
appear
is
not
moved
by
such
extremes
of
agitation
as
the
atmosphere
in
a
calm
it
is
never
so
inertly
still
and
in
a
storm
it
is
never
so
far
beyond
the
normal
condition
in
its
agitation
as
is
the
wind
the
ocean
surface
to
some
extent
operates
as
the
governor
of
a
checking
an
excess
in
either
direction
in
very
moderate
weather
the
number
of
waves
to
the
mile
is
greatly
increased
while
their
speed
is
not
very
much
diminished
indeed
the
rate
at
which
they
travel
may
even
be
increased
this
latter
phenomenon
generally
occurs
when
long
ocean
rollers
pass
out
of
a
region
of
high
wind
into
one
of
relative
calm
the
energy
remaining
for
a
long
time
comparatively
constant
by
reason
of
the
multiplication
of
short
low
waves
created
out
of
long
high
ones
on
all
ocean
coasts
the
normal
condition
of
the
surface
is
governed
by
this
law
and
it
follows
that
no
matter
what
the
local
weather
may
be
at
any
given
time
there
is
always
plenty
of
power
available
an
attempt
was
made
by
antoine
after
a
long
series
of
observations
to
establish
a
general
relation
between
the
speed
of
the
wind
and
that
of
the
waves
caused
by
it
the
formulæ
being
published
in
the
nautique
et
in
the
rule
may
be
taken
as
correct
within
certain
limits
although
in
calm
weather
when
the
condition
of
the
ocean
surface
is
almost
entirely
ruled
by
distant
disturbances
it
has
but
little
relevancy
approximately
the
velocity
of
wave
transmission
is
seven
times
the
fourth
root
of
the
so
that
when
the
latter
is
a
brisk
breeze
of
sixteen
miles
an
hour
the
waves
will
be
travelling
fourteen
miles
an
hour
or
very
nearly
as
fast
as
the
wind
when
on
the
other
hand
a
light
breeze
of
nine
miles
an
hour
is
driving
the
waves
the
latter
according
to
the
formula
should
run
about
twelve
and
a
half
miles
an
hour
but
in
point
of
fact
the
influence
of
more
distant
commotion
nearly
always
interferes
with
this
result
as
a
matter
of
experience
the
waves
on
an
ocean
coast
are
usually
running
faster
than
the
wind
and
being
so
much
more
numerous
in
calm
than
they
are
in
rough
weather
they
maintain
comparatively
a
uniform
sum
total
of
energy
it
is
obvious
that
so
far
as
practical
purposes
are
concerned
three
waves
of
an
available
height
of
three
feet
each
are
as
effective
as
one
of
nine
feet
if
the
state
of
the
weather
be
such
that
the
average
wave
length
is
feet
there
will
be
exactly
thirty
waves
to
the
mile
and
if
the
speed
be
twelve
miles
an
hour
that
is
to
say
if
an
expanse
of
twelve
miles
of
waves
pass
a
given
point
hourly
then
waves
will
pass
every
sixty
minutes
or
six
every
minute
in
the
plant
as
described
each
buoy
of
one
hundred
tons
displacement
when
raised
and
depressed
say
three
feet
by
every
wave
will
thus
be
capable
of
giving
power
equal
to
three
times
or
per
minute
the
unit
of
nominal
being
or
about
fifteen
per
minute
it
is
evident
that
each
buoy
at
its
maximum
would
be
capable
of
giving
about
supposing
that
half
of
the
possible
energy
were
exerted
at
the
forward
and
half
at
the
backward
stroke
and
that
each
buoy
were
always
in
position
to
exert
its
full
power
upon
the
uprising
shaft
without
deduction
the
total
effective
duty
of
a
machine
such
as
has
been
described
would
be
in
practice
however
the
available
duty
would
probably
according
to
minor
circumstances
be
rather
more
or
rather
less
than
chapter
iii
storage
of
power
the
three
principal
forms
of
stored
power
which
are
now
in
sight
above
the
horizon
of
the
industrial
outlook
are
the
electric
storage
battery
compressed
air
and
the
first
of
these
has
come
largely
into
use
owing
to
the
demand
for
a
regulated
and
stored
supply
of
electricity
available
for
lighting
purposes
indeed
the
storage
battery
has
practically
rendered
safe
the
wide
introduction
of
electric
lighting
because
a
number
of
cells
when
once
charged
are
always
available
as
a
reserve
in
case
of
any
failure
in
the
power
or
in
the
generators
at
any
central
station
and
also
because
by
means
of
the
storage
cells
or
accumulators
the
amount
of
available
electrical
energy
can
be
subdivided
into
different
and
subordinate
circuits
thus
obviating
the
necessity
for
the
employment
of
currents
of
very
high
voltage
and
eluding
the
only
problem
of
dividing
a
current
traversing
a
wire
as
conveniently
as
lighting
gas
is
divided
by
taking
small
pipes
off
from
the
gas
mains
compressed
air
for
the
storage
of
power
has
hitherto
been
best
appreciated
in
mining
operations
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
this
being
that
the
liberated
air
itself
apart
from
the
power
which
it
conveyed
and
stored
has
been
so
great
a
boon
to
the
miner
working
in
stopes
and
drives
the
cooling
effects
of
the
expansion
after
close
compression
are
also
very
grateful
to
men
labouring
hard
at
very
great
depths
where
the
heat
from
the
country
rock
would
become
in
the
absence
of
such
artificial
refrigeration
almost
overpowering
for
underground
railway
traffic
exactly
the
same
recommendations
have
at
one
period
during
the
fourth
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
given
an
adventitious
stimulus
to
the
use
of
compressed
air
yet
it
is
now
undoubted
that
even
in
deep
mining
the
engineer
best
policy
is
to
adopt
different
methods
for
the
conveyance
and
storage
of
power
on
the
one
hand
and
for
the
ventilation
of
the
workings
on
the
other
few
temptations
are
more
illusory
in
the
course
of
industrial
progress
than
those
presented
by
that
class
of
inventions
which
aim
at
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
if
one
object
be
successfully
accomplished
it
almost
invariably
happens
that
the
other
is
indifferently
carried
out
but
the
most
frequent
result
is
that
both
of
them
suffer
in
the
attempt
to
adapt
machinery
to
irreconcilable
purposes
the
electric
is
now
winning
its
way
into
the
mines
which
are
ventilated
with
comparative
ease
as
well
as
into
those
which
are
more
difficult
to
supply
with
air
it
is
plain
therefore
that
on
its
merits
as
a
conveyer
and
storer
of
power
the
electric
current
is
preferable
to
compressed
air
the
heat
that
is
generated
and
then
dissipated
in
the
compression
of
any
gas
for
such
a
purpose
represents
a
very
serious
loss
of
power
and
it
is
altogether
an
insufficient
excuse
to
point
to
the
compensation
of
coolness
being
secured
from
the
expansion
fans
driven
by
electric
motors
already
offer
a
better
solution
of
the
ventilation
difficulty
and
the
advantages
on
this
side
are
certain
to
increase
rather
than
to
diminish
during
the
next
few
years
the
electric
which
can
already
hold
its
own
with
that
driven
by
compressed
air
is
therefore
bound
to
gain
ground
in
the
future
this
is
a
type
and
indication
of
what
will
happen
all
along
the
industrial
line
the
electric
current
taking
the
place
of
the
majority
of
other
means
adopted
for
the
transmission
of
power
even
in
workshops
where
it
is
important
to
have
a
wide
distribution
of
power
and
each
man
must
be
able
to
turn
on
a
supply
of
it
to
his
bench
at
any
moment
shafting
is
being
displaced
by
electric
cables
for
the
conveyance
of
power
to
numerous
small
motors
the
loss
of
power
in
this
system
has
already
been
reduced
to
less
than
that
which
occurs
with
shafting
unless
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
and
in
places
where
the
works
are
necessarily
distributed
over
a
considerable
area
the
advantage
is
so
pronounced
that
hardly
any
factories
of
that
kind
will
be
erected
ten
years
hence
without
resort
being
had
to
electricity
and
small
motors
as
the
means
of
distributing
the
requisite
supplies
of
power
to
the
spots
where
they
are
needed
it
was
a
significant
fact
that
at
the
paris
exposition
of
the
electric
system
of
distribution
was
adopted
in
regard
to
compressed
air
however
it
seems
practically
certain
that
notwithstanding
its
inferiority
to
electric
storage
of
power
it
is
applicable
to
so
many
kinds
of
small
and
cheap
installations
that
on
the
whole
its
area
of
usefulness
instead
of
being
restricted
will
be
largely
increased
in
the
near
future
there
will
be
an
advance
all
along
the
line
and
although
electric
storage
will
far
outstrip
compressed
air
for
the
purposes
of
the
large
manufacturer
the
air
reservoir
will
prove
highly
useful
in
isolated
situations
and
particularly
for
agricultural
work
for
example
as
an
adjunct
to
the
ordinary
rural
windmill
for
pumping
water
it
will
prove
much
more
handy
and
effective
than
the
system
at
present
in
vogue
of
keeping
large
tanks
on
hand
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
a
supply
of
water
during
periods
of
calm
weather
regarding
a
tank
of
water
elevated
above
the
ground
and
filled
from
a
well
as
representing
so
much
stored
energy
and
also
comparing
this
with
an
equal
bulk
of
air
compressed
to
about
pounds
pressure
to
the
square
inch
it
would
be
easy
to
show
that
unless
the
water
has
been
pumped
from
a
very
deep
well
the
power
which
its
elevation
indicates
must
be
only
a
small
fraction
of
that
enclosed
in
the
air
reservoir
it
will
be
one
great
point
in
favour
of
compressed
air
as
a
form
of
stored
energy
for
the
special
purpose
of
pumping
that
by
making
a
continuous
small
flow
of
air
take
the
place
of
the
water
at
the
lowest
level
in
the
upward
pipe
it
is
possible
to
cause
it
to
do
the
pumping
without
the
intervention
of
any
motor
one
means
of
effecting
this
may
be
simply
indicated
the
air
under
pressure
is
admitted
from
a
very
small
air
pipe
and
the
bubbles
as
they
rise
fill
the
hollow
of
an
inverted
iron
cup
rising
and
falling
on
a
bearing
like
a
hinge
above
and
beneath
the
chamber
containing
this
cup
are
valves
opening
upwards
and
similar
to
those
of
an
ordinary
force
or
suction
pump
the
cup
must
be
weighted
with
adjustable
weights
so
that
it
will
not
rise
until
quite
full
of
air
when
that
point
is
reached
the
stroke
is
completed
the
air
having
driven
upwards
a
quantity
of
water
of
equal
bulk
with
itself
and
as
the
cup
falls
again
by
its
own
weight
the
vacuum
caused
by
the
air
escaping
upwards
through
the
pipe
is
filled
by
an
inrush
of
water
through
the
lower
valve
the
function
of
the
upper
valve
at
that
time
is
to
keep
the
water
in
the
pipe
from
falling
when
the
pressure
on
the
column
is
removed
the
expansive
power
of
the
air
enables
it
to
do
more
lifting

that
a

can
be
used
at
the
former

cheap

working
on
the
same
principle
that
is
to
say
through
the
upward
escape
of
compressed

vapour
filling
a
cup
and
operating
it
by
its
buoyancy
or
turning
a
wheel
in
a
similar
manner
will
doubtless
be
a
feature
in
the
machine
work
of
the
future
and
for
motors
of
this
description
it
is
obvious
that
compressed
air
will
be
very
useful
as
the
form
of
excepting
under
very
special
conditions
steam
is
not
available
for
such
a
purpose
seeing
that
it
condenses
long
before
it
has
risen
any
material

a
column
of
cold
water
the
present
accumulator
remarked
sylvanus
thompson
in
the
year
referring
to
the
faure
storage
batteries
then
in
use
probably
bears
as
much
resemblance
to
the
future
accumulator
as
a
glass
used
in
chemical
experiments
for
holding
gas
does
to
the
gasometer
of
a
city
gasworks
or
james
watt
first
model
does
to
the
engines
of
an
atlantic
steamer
when
faure
having
in
improved
upon
the
storage
battery
of
planté
sent
his
battery
from
paris
to
glasgow
carrying
in
it
stored
electrical
energy
it
was
found
to
contain
power
equal
to
close
upon
a
million
which
is
about
the
work
done
by
a
during
the
space
of
half
an
hour
this
battery
weighed
very
nearly
lb
it
nevertheless
represented
an
immense
forward
step
in
the
problem
of
compressing
a
given
quantity
of
potential
power
into
a
small
weight
of
accumulator
the
progress
made
during
less
than
twenty
years
to
the
end
of
the
century
may
be
estimated
from
the
conditions
laid
down
by
the
automobile
club
of
paris
for
the
competitive
test
of
accumulators
applicable
to
purposes
in
it
was
stipulated
that
five
cells
weighing
in
all
should
give
out
of
electric
intensity
and
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
test
there
should
remain
a
voltage
of
volt
per
cell
very
great
improvements
in
the
construction
of
electric
accumulators
are
to
be
looked
for
in
the
near
future
hitherto
the
average
duration
of
the
life
of
a
storage
cell
has
not
been
more
than
about
two
years
and
where
impurities
have
been
present
in
the
sulphuric
acid
or
in
the
litharge
or
minium
employed
the
term
of
durability
has
been
still
further
shortened
it
must
be
remembered
that
while
the
principal
chemical
and
electrical
action
in
the
cell
is
a
circular
one
that
is
to
say
the
plates
and
liquids
get
back
to
the
original
condition
from
which
they
started
when
beginning
work
in
a
given
period
there
is
also
a
progressive
minor
action
depending
upon
the
impurities
that
may
be
present
such
a
reagent
for
instance
as
nitric
acid
has
an
extremely
injurious
effect
upon
the
plates
during
the
first
decade
after
planté
and
faure
had
made
their
original
discoveries
the
main
drawback
to
the
advancement
of
the
electric
accumulator
for
the
storage
of
power
owed
its
existence
to
the
lack
of
precise
knowledge
among
those
placed
in
charge
of
storage
batteries
as
to
the
destructive
effects
of
impurities
in
the
cells
it
is
however
now
the
rule
that
all
acids
and
all
samples
of
water
used
for
the
purpose
must
be
carefully
tested
before
adoption
and
this
practice
in
itself
has
greatly
prolonged
the
average
life
of
the
accumulator
cell
the
era
of
the
large
electric
accumulator
of
the
kind
foreshadowed
by
sylvanus
thompson
has
not
yet
arrived
the
simple
reason
being
that
electric
power
storage
apart
from
the
special
purposes
of
the
subdivision
and
transmission
for
lighting
has
not
yet
been
tried
on
a
large
scale
for
the
regulation
and
graduation
of
power
it
is
exceedingly
handy
to
be
able
to
a
number
of
small
accumulator
cells
for
any
particular
purpose
and
of
course
the
degree
of
control
held
in
the
hands
of
the
engineer
must
depend
largely
on
the
smallness
of
each
individual
cell
and
the
number
which
he
has
at
command
this
fact
of
itself
tends
to
keep
down
the
size
of
the
storage
cell
which
is
most
popular
but
when
power
storage
by
means
of
the
electric
accumulator
really
begins
in
earnest
the
cells
will
attain
to
what
would
at
present
be
regarded
as
mammoth
proportions
and
the
special
purpose
aimed
at
in
each
instance
of
power
installation
will
be
the
securing
of
continuity
in
the
working
of
a
machine
depending
upon
some
intermittent
natural
force
windmills
are
especially
marked
out
as
the
engines
which
will
be
used
to
put
electrical
energy
into
the
accumulators
from
these
latter
again
the
power
will
be
given
out
and
conveyed
to
a
distance
continuously
high
ridges
and
eminences
of
all
kinds
will
in
the
future
be
selected
as
the
sites
of
and
accumulator
plants
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
corn
from
the
required
to
be
ground
into
flour
by
the
agency
of
it
was
customary
to
build
the
mill
on
the
top
of
some
high
hill
and
to
cart
all
the
material
laboriously
to
the
eminence
in
the
installations
of
the
future
the
power
will
be
brought
to
the
material
rather
than
the
material
to
the
power
from
the
ranges
or
mountain
peaks
and
also
from
smaller
hills
will
radiate
electrical
branching
out
into
network
on
the
plains
and
supplying
power
for
almost
every
purpose
to
which
man
applies
physical
force
or
energy
the
during
the
twentieth
century
will
vigorously
dispute
the
field
against
electrical
storage
and
its
success
in
the
struggle
so
far
as
regards
its
own
particular
province
will
be
enhanced
owing
to
the
fact
that
in
some
respects
it
will
be
able
to
command
the
services
of
electricity
as
its
handmaid
are
already
very
largely
used
as
the
actuators
of
electric
lighting
machinery
but
in
the
developments
which
are
now
foreshadowed
by
the
advent
of
acetylene
gas
the
relation
will
be
reversed
in
other
words
the
will
owe
its
supply
of
cheap
fuel
to
the
electric
current
derived
at
small
expense
from
natural
sources
of
power
calcium
carbide
by
means
of
which
acetylene
gas
is
obtained
as
a
product
from
water
becomes
in
this
view
stored
power
the
marvellously
cheap
which
is
made
through
a
jet
of
steam
impinging
upon
incandescent
carbons
or
upon
other
suitable
glowing
hot
materials
will
no
doubt
for
a
long
time
command
the
market
after
the
date
at
which
for
the
generation
of
power
has
been
partially
superseded
but
it
seems
exceedingly
probable
that
a
compromise
will
ultimately
be
effected
between
the
methods
adopted
for
making
and
calcium
carbide
respectively
the
electric
current
being
employed
to
keep
the
carbons
incandescent
when
power
is
to
be
sold
in
concrete
form
it
will
be
made
up
as
calcium
carbide
so
that
it
can
be
conveyed
to
any
place
where
it
is
required
without
the
assistance
of
either
pipes
or
wires
but
when
the
laying
of
the
latter
is
practicable
as
it
will
be
in
the
majority
of
instances
the
gas
for
an
engine
will
be
obtainable
without
the
need
for
forcing
lime
to
combine
with
carbon
as
in
calcium
carbide
petroleum
oil
is
estimated
to
supply
power
at
just
the
price
of
acetylene
gas
made
with
calcium
carbide
at
a
price
of
per
ton
this
calculation
was
drawn
up
before
the
occurrence
of
the
material
rise
in
the
price
of
petrol
in
the
last
year
of
the
nineteenth
century
while
concurrently
the
price
of
calcium
carbide
was
falling
a
similar
process
will
on
the
average
be
maintained
throughout
each
decade
and
as
larger
plants
with
cheaper
natural
sources
of
energy
are
brought
into
requisition
the
costs
of
power
as
obtained
from
oil
and
from
acetylene
gas
will
more
and
more
closely
approximate
until
in
course
of
time
they
will
be
about
equal
after
which
no
doubt
the
relative
positions
will
be
reversed
although
not
perhaps
in
the
same
ratio
time
is
all
on
the
side
of
the
agent
which
depends
for
its
cheapness
of
production
on
the
utilisation
of
any
natural
source
of
power
which
is
free
of
all
cost
save
interest
wear
and
tear
and
supervision
even
the
itself
is
not
exempt
from
the
operation
of
the
general
law
placing
the
growing
advantage
on
the
side
of
power
that
is
obtainable
gratis
one
cubic
inch
of
water
converted
into
steam
and
at
boiling
point
will
raise
a
ton
weight
to
the
height
of
one
foot
and
the
quantity
of
coal
of
good
quality
needed
for
the
transformation
of
the
water
is
very
small
one
pound
of
good
coal
will
evaporate
nine
pounds
of
water
equal
to
about
cubic
inches
this
doing
of
work
but
niagara
performs
the
same
amount
of
work
at
infinitely
less
cost
however
small
any
quantity
may
be
its
ratio
to
nothing
is
infinity
it
has
been
the
custom
during
the
nineteenth
century
to
institute
comparisons
between
the
marvellous
economy
of
steam
power
and
the
expensive
wastefulness
of
human
muscular
effort
for
instance
the
full
day
work
of
an
eastern
porter
specially
trained
to
carry
heavy
weights
will
generally
amount
to
the
removal
of
a
load
of
from
three
to
five
for
a
distance
of
one
mile
but
such
a
labourer
in
the
course
of
a
long
day
has
only
expended
as
much
power
as
would
be
stored
up
in
about
five
ounces
of
coal
still
the
fact
remains
that
one
of
the
greatest
problems
of
the
future
is
that
which
concerns
the
reduction
in
the
cost
of
power
hundreds
of
millions
of
the
human
race
pass
lives
of
a
kind
of
dull
monotonous
toil
which
develops
only
the
muscular
at
the
expense
of
the
higher
faculties
of
the
body
they
are
almost
entirely
cut
off
from
social
intercourse
with
their
and
they
sink
prematurely
into
decrepitude
simply
by
reason
of
the
lack
of
a
cheap
and
abundant
supply
of
mechanical
power
ready
at
hand
wherever
it
is
wanted
scores
of
enterprises
of
great
pith
and
moment
in
the
industrial
advancement
of
the
world
have
to
be
abandoned
by
reason
of
the
same
lack
in
mining
in
agriculture
in
transport
and
in
manufacture
the
thing
that
is
needful
to
convert
the
human
machine
into
a
more
or
less
intelligent
brainworker
is
cheaper
power
all
the
technical
education
in
the
world
will
not
avail
to
raise
the
labourer
in
the
intellectual
scale
if
his
daily
work
be
only
such
as
a
horse
or
an
engine
might
perform
the
transmission
of
power
through
the
medium
of
the
electric
current
will
naturally
attain
its
first
great
development
in
the
neighbourhoods
of
large
waterfalls
such
as
niagara
when
the
manufacturers
within
a
short
radius
of
the
source
of
power
in
each
case
have
begun
to
fully
reap
the
benefit
due
to
cheap
power
competition
will
assert
itself
in
many
different
ways
the
values
of
real
property
will
rise
and
population
will
tend
to
become
congested
within
the
localities
served
it
will
be
found
however
that
facilities
for
shipment
will
to
a
large
extent
perpetuate
the
advantage
at
present
held
by
manufactories
situated
on
ports
and
harbours
and
this
of
course
will
apply
with
peculiar
force
to
the
cases
of
articles
of
considerable
bulk
where
a
very
great
deal
of
power
is
needed
for
the
making
of
an
article
or
material
of
comparatively
small
weight
and
bulk
proportioned
to
its
value
such
for
instance
as
calcium
carbide
or
aluminium
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
source
of
natural
power
will
offer
superlative
inducements
but
an
immense
number
of
things
lie
between
the
domains
of
these
two
classes
and
for
the
economical
manufacture
of
these
it
is
imperative
that
both
cheap
power
and
low
wharfage
rates
should
be
obtainable
an
increasingly
intense
demand
must
thus
spring
up
for
systems
of
long
distance
transmission
and
very
high
voltage
will
be
adopted
as
the
means
of
diminishing
the
loss
of
power
due
to
leakage
from
the
cables
similarly
the
polyphase
system
which
is
eminently
adapted
to
installations
of
the
nature
indicated
must
demand
increasing
attention
taking
a
concrete
example
mention
may
be
made
of
the
effects
to
be
expected
from
the
proposed
scheme
for
diverting
some
of
the
headwaters
of
the
tay
and
its
lakes
from
the
eastern
to
the
western
shores
of
scotland
and
establishing
at
loch
leven
the
western
inlet
not
the
inland
lake
of
that
name
a
seaport
town
devoted
to
manufacturing
purposes
requiring
very
cheap
supplies
of
power
it
is
obvious
that
the
owners
of
mills
in
and
around
glasgow
and
only
forty
or
fifty
miles
distant
will
make
the
most
strenuous
exertions
to
enable
them
to
secure
a
similar
advantage
it
is
already
claimed
that
with
the
use
of
currents
of
high
voltage
for
carrying
the
power
and
transformers
converting
these
into
a
suitable
medium
for
the
driving
of
machinery
a
fairly
economical
transmission
can
be
ensured
along
a
distance
of
miles
it
therefore
seems
plain
that
the
natural
forces
derived
from
such
sources
as
waterfalls
can
safely
be
reckoned
upon
as
friends
rather
than
as
foes
of
the
vested
interests
of
all
the
great
cities
of
the
united
kingdom
the
possibilities
of
long
distance
transmission
are
greatly
enhanced
by
the
very
recent
discovery
that
a
cable
carrying
a
current
of
high
voltage
can
be
most
effectually
insulated
by
encasing
it
in
the
midst
of
a
tube
filled
with
wet
sawdust
and
kept
at
a
low
temperature
preferably
at
the
freezing
point
of
water
wireless
transmission
of
a
small
amount
of
power
has
been
proved
to
be
experimentally
possible
in
the
rarefied
atmosphere
at
a
height
of
five
or
ten
miles
from
the
earth
surface
electric
discharges
of
very
high
voltage
are
conveyed
without
any
other
conducting
medium
than
that
of
the
air
by
sending
up
balloons
carrying
suspended
wires
the
positions
of
despatch
and
of
receipt
can
be
so
elevated
that
the
resistance
of
the
atmosphere
can
be
almost
indefinitely
diminished
in
this
way
small
motors
have
been
worked
by
discharges
generated
at
considerable
distances
and
absolutely
without
the
existence
of
any
connection
by
metallic
conductors
possibilities
of
the
exportation
of
power
from
suitable
stations
such
as
the
neighbourhoods
of
waterfalls
and
its
transmission
for
distances
of
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
miles
have
been
spoken
of
in
relation
to
the
industrial
prospects
of
the
twentieth
century
comparing
any
such
hypothetical
system
with
that
of
sending
power
along
good
metallic
conductors
there
is
at
once
apparent
a
very
serious
objection
in
the
needless
dispersion
of
energy
throughout
space
in
every
direction
if
a
power
generator
by
wireless
transmission
without
any
metallic
connection
can
work
one
motor
at
a
distance
of
say
miles
then
it
can
also
operate
millions
of
similar
possible
motors
situated
at
the
same
distance
and
by
far
the
greater
part
of
its
force
must
be
wasted
in
upward
dispersion
the
analogy
of
the
wireless
transmitter
of
intelligence
may
be
misleading
if
applied
to
the
question
of
power
the
practicability
of
wireless
telegraphy
depends
upon
the
marvellous
susceptibility
of
the
coherer
which
enables
it
to
respond
to
an
impulse
almost
infinitesimally
small
certainly
very
much
smaller
than
that
despatched
by
the
generator
from
the
receiving
station
from
this
it
follows
as
already
stated
that
the
analogy
of
apparatus
designed
merely
for
the
despatch
of
intelligence
by
signalling
can
not
safely
be
applied
to
the
case
of
the
transmission
of
energy
making
all
due
allowances
for
the
prospects
of
advance
in
minimising
the
resistance
of
the
atmosphere
it
must
nevertheless
be
remembered
that
any
wireless
system
will
be
called
upon
to
compete
with
improved
means
of
conveying
the
electric
current
along
metallic
circuits
electrical
science
moreover
is
only
at
the
commencement
of
its
work
in
economising
the
cost
of
the
invention
by
which
one
wire
can
be
used
to
convey
the
return
current
of
two
cables
very
much
larger
in
sectional
area
is
only
one
instance
in
point
the
two
major
cables
carry
currents
running
in
opposite
directions
and
as
these
currents
are
both
caused
to
return
along
the
third
and
smaller
wire
their
forces
balance
one
another
with
the
result
that
the
return
wire
needs
only
to
carry
a
small
the
return
wire
in
fact
is
analogous
to
the
banking
clearing
house
which
deals
with
balances
only
and
which
therefore
can
sometimes
adjust
business
to
the
value
of
many
millions

iv
artificial
power
the
is
the
most
clearly
visible
of
the
revolutionary
agencies
in
motors
using
the
artificial
sources
of
power
in
the
first
attempts
to
introduce
the
principle
the
false
analogy
of
the
gave
rise
to
much
waste
of
inventive
energy
and
of
money
but
the
more
recent
and
more
distinctly
successful
types
of
machine
have
been
constructed
with
a
clear
understanding
that
the
windmill
is
the
true
precursor
of
the
it
is
clearly
perceived
that
although
it
may
be
convenient
and
even
essential
to
reduce
the
arms
to
pigmy
dimensions
and
to
enclose
them
in
a
tube
still
the
general
principle
of
the
machine
must
resemble
that
of
a
number
of
wind
motors
all
running
on
the
same
shaft
it
has
been
proved
moreover
that
this
multiplicity
of
minute
wheels
and
arms
has
a
very
distinct
advantage
in
that
it
renders
possible
the
utilisation
of
the
expansive
power
of
steam
the
first
impact
is
small
in
area
but
intense
in
force
while
those
arms
which
receive
the
expanded
steam
further
on
are
larger
in
size
as
suited
to
making
the
best
use
of
a
weaker
force
distributed
over
a
greater
amount
of
space
the
enormous
speed
at
which
steam
under
heavy
pressure
rushes
out
of
an
orifice
was
not
duly
appreciated
by
the
first
experimenters
in
this
direction
to
obtain
the
best
results
in
utilising
the
power
from
escaping
steam
there
must
be
a
certain
definite
proportion
between
the
speed
of
the
vapour
and
that
of
the
vane
or
arm
against
which
it
strikes
in
other
words
the
latter
must
not
smash
the
jet
but
must
run
along
with
it
in
the
case
of
the
windmill
the
ratio
has
been
stated
approximately
by
the
generalisation
that
the
velocity
of
the
tips
of
the
sails
is
about
two
and
a
half
times
that
of
the
wind
this
refers
to
the
old
style
of
windmill
as
used
for
grinding
corn
the
steam
turbine
must
therefore
be
essentially
a
motor
of
very
great
initial
speed
and
the
efforts
of
recent
inventors
have
been
wisely
directed
in
the
first
instance
to
the
object
of
applying
it
to
those
purposes
for
which
machinery
could
be
coupled
up
to
the
motor
with
little
if
any
necessity
for
slowing
down
the
motion
through
such
appliances
as
belting
toothed
wheels
or
other
forms
of
intermediate
gearing
the
dynamo
for
electric
lighting
naturally
first
suggested
itself
but
even
in
this
application
it
was
found
necessary
to
adopt
a
rate
of
speed
considerably
lower
than
that
which
the
steam
imparts
to
the
turbine
and
unfortunately
it
is
exactly
in
the
arrangement
of
the
gear
for
the
first
that
the
main
difficulty
comes
in
nearly
parallel
is
the
case
of
the
cream
separator
to
which
the
principle
has
been
applied
with
a
certain
degree
of
success
by
means
of
fine
flexible
steel
shafts
running
in
bearings
swathed
in
oil
it
has
been
found
possible
to
utilise
the
comparatively
feeble
force
of
a
small
steam
jet
operating
at
immense
speed
to
produce
one
of
much
slower
rate
but
enormously
greater
strength
some
success
has
been
achieved
also
in
using
the
principle
not
only
for
cream
separators
which
require
a
comparatively
high
velocity
but
for
other
purposes
connected
with
the
rural
and
manufacturing
industries
an
immense
forward
stride
however
was
made
when
the
idea
was
first
conceived
of
a
and
a
being
fixed
on
the
same
shaft
and
the
latter
being
used
for
the
propulsion
of
a
vessel
at
sea
in
this
case
it
is
obvious
that
by
a
suitable
adjustment
of
the
pitch
of
screw
adopted
in
both
cases
a
nice
mathematical
agreement
between
the
vapour
power
and
the
liquid
application
of
that
power
can
be
ensured
all
previous
records
of
speed
have
been
eclipsed
by
the
steamers
engined
on
this
principle
through
the
abolition
of
the
principal
causes
of
excessive
vibration
which
renders
dangerous
the
enlargement
of
marine
reciprocating
engines
beyond
a
certain
size
the
final
limit
of
possible
speed
has
been
indefinitely
extended
the
comfort
of
the
passenger
equally
with
the
safety
of
the
hull
demands
the
diminution
of
the
vibration
nuisance
in
modern
steamships
and
whether
the
first
attempts
to
cater
for
the
need
by
be
fully
successful
or
not
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
fast
mail
packets
of
the
future
will
be
driven
by
constructed
on
a
system
in
which
the
turbine
principle
will
form
an
important
part
further
applications
will
soon
follow
it
is
clear
that
if
the
can
be
advantageously
used
for
the
driving
of
a
vessel
through
the
water
then
conversely
it
can
be
similarly
applied
to
the
creation
of
a
current
of
water
or
of
any
other
suitable
liquid
this
again
is
applicable
to
the
driving
of
machinery
at
any
rate
that
may
be
desired
in
this
view
the
process
which
involves
elaborate
and
delicate
machinery
when
accomplished
in
the
purely
mechanical
method
can
be
much
more
economically
effected
through
the
friction
of
fluid
particles
one
method
of
achieving
this
object
is
an
arrangement
in
which
the
escaping
steam
drives
a
running
through
a
long
tube
and
passing
into
the
water
in
a
circular
tank
in
which
again
the
shaft
carries
a
spiral
or
turbine
screw
for
propelling
the
water
the
arrangement
it
will
be
seen
is
strictly
analogous
to
that
of
the
as
used
in
marine
propulsion
the
shaft
passing
through
the
side
of
the
tank
just
as
it
does
through
the
stern
of
the
vessel
one
essential
point
however
is
that
the
line
of
the
shaft
must
not
pass
through
the
centre
of
the
circular
tank
but
must
form
the
chord
of
an
arc
so
that
when
the
water
is
driven
against
the
side
by
the
revolution
of
the
screw
it
acts
like
a
tangential
jet
practically
the
water
is
thus
kept
in
motion
just
as
it
would
be
if
a
hose
with
a
strong
jet
of
water
were
inserted
and
caused
to
play
at
an
obtuse
angle
against
the
inner
side
motion
having
been
imparted
to
the
fluid
in
the
tank
a
simple
device
such
as
a
immersed
at
its
lower
end
may
be
adopted
for
taking
up
the
power
and
passing
it
on
to
the
machinery
required
to
be
actuated
by
setting
both
the
shaft
carrying
the
vanes
for
the
and
the
screw
for
the
propulsion
of
the
water
at
a
downward
inclination
it
becomes
practicable
to
drive
the
fluid
without
requiring
any
hole
in
the
tank
and
in
this
case
the
latter
may
be
shaped
in
annular
form
and
pivoted
so
that
it
becomes
a
horizontal
obstructing
projections
on
the
inside
periphery
of
the
annular
tank
assist
the
water
to
carry
the
latter
along
with
it
in
its
circular
motion
for
small
steam
motors
particularly
for
agricultural
and
domestic
purposes
the
turbine
principle
is
destined
to
render
services
of
the
utmost
importance
the
prospect
of
its
extremely
economical
construction
depends
largely
upon
the
fact
that
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
very
small
bearings
carrying
narrow
shafts
it
contains
no
parts
demanding
the
same
fine
finish
as
does
the
cylinder
of
a
reciprocating
engine
it
solves
in
a
very
simple
manner
the
problem
of
the
rotary
engine
upon
which
so
much
ingenuity
has
been
fruitlessly
exercised
the
also
has
shown
that
for
taking
advantage
of
the
generation
and
the
expansive
power
of
steam
there
is
no
absolute
necessity
for
including
a
chamber
with
moving
parts
in
the
machine
for
very
small
motors
suitable
for
working
fans
and
working
other
household
appliances
the
use
of
a
jet
of
steam
applied
directly
to
drive
a
small
annular
filled
with
mercury
without
the
intervention
of
any
turbine
will
no
doubt
prove
handy
but
in
the
economy
of
the
future
such
appliances
will
take
the
place
of
electrical
machinery
only
in
exceptional
situations
one
promising
use
of
the
turbine
or
used
to
propel
a
filled
with
liquid
as
described
has
for
its
object
the
supply
of
the
electric
light
in
country
houses
in
this
case
the
is
fitted
on
its
lower
side
to
act
as
the
armature
of
a
dynamo
and
the
magnets
are
placed
horizontally
around
it
the
full
effective
power
from
a
jet
of
steam
is
not
communicated
to
a
dynamo
for
electric
lighting
or
other
purposes
unless
there
be
a
definite
ratio
between
the
speeds
of
the
turbine
and
of
the
armature
respectively
this
may
be
conveniently
provided
for
with
more
precision
and
in
a
less
elaborate
way
than
that
which
has
just
been
described
if
the
steam
jet
be
made
to
drive
a
vertically
pendant
turbine
the
lower
extremity
of
which
carrying
very
small
horizontal
paddles
must
be
inserted
into
the
centre
of
a
circular
tank
the
principle
upon
which
the
reduction
of
speed
necessary
for
the
dynamo
is
then
effected
depends
upon
the
fact
that
in
a
whirlpool
the
liquid
near
the
centre
runs
nearly
as
fast
as
that
on
the
outer
periphery
and
therefore
the
circles
being
so
very
much
smaller
the
number
of
revolutions
effected
in
a
given
time
is
much
greater
thus
a
steam
jet
turning
a
pendant
turbine
dipping
into
the
middle
of
the
whirlpool
and
carrying
paddles
at
an
enormously
high
speed
may
be
made
to
impart
motion
to
the
water
in
a
circular
tank
or
if
desired
to
the
tank
itself
at
a
very
much
slower
rate
the
amount
of
the
reduction
of
course
depending
mainly
on
the
ratio
between
the
diameter
of
the
tank
and
the
length
of
the
small
paddles
at
the
centre
setting
the
liquid
in
motion
for
special
purposes
it
is
best
to
substitute
a
spherical
for
an
ordinary
circular
tank
and
the
size
may
be
greatly
diminished
by
using
mercury
instead
of
water
the
sphere
is
complete
excepting
for
a
small
aperture
at
the
top
for
the
admission
of
the
steel
shaft
of
the
turbine
no
matter
how
high
may
be
the
speed
the
liquid
can
not
be
thrown
out
from
a
spherical
revolving
receptacle
constructed
in
this
way
moreover
the
mercury
acts
not
only
as
a
transmitter
of
the
power
from
the
turbine
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
wanted
but
also
as
a
governor
whenever
the
speed
becomes
so
great
as
to
throw
the
liquid
entirely
into
the
sides
of
the
sphere
so
that
the
shaft
and
paddles
are
running
free
of
contact
with
it
in
the
middle
the
machine
slows
down
and
it
can
not
again
attain
full
speed
until
the
same
conditions
recur
the
rate
of
speed
which
may
be
worked
up
to
as
a
maximum
is
determined
by
the
position
of
the
which
is
adjustable
and
floats
upon
the
liquid
although
controlled
in
its
circular
motion
by
the
shaft
which
passes
through
a
square
aperture
in
it
and
also
a
sleeve
extending
upward
from
it
the
duty
of
the
latter
is
to
economise
steam
by
cutting
off
the
jet
as
soon
as
by
its
rapidity
of
motion
the
has
thrown
the
mercury
to
the
sides
to
such
an
extent
as
to
sink
to
a
certain
level
in
the
centre
cheap
motors
coupled
with
cheap
dynamos
will
in
the
twentieth
century
go
far
towards
lightening
the
labours
of
millions
whose
toil
is
at
present
far
too
much
of
a
mere
mechanical
nature
the
dynamo
itself
however
requires
to
be
greatly
reduced
in
first
cost
particularly
it
is
necessary
that
the
expense
involved
in
drawing
the
wire
insulating
it
and
winding
machines
with
it
should
be
diminished
this
will
no
doubt
be
partly
accomplished
by
the
electrolytic
producers
of
copper
when
once
they
get
properly
started
on
methods
of
depositing
thin
strips
or
wires
of
tough
copper
on
to
sheets
of
insulating
material
for
wrapping
round
the
magnets
and
other
effective
parts
intended
for
dynamos
there
is
no
fundamental
reason
which
forbids
that
when
electro
deposition
is
resorted
to
for
the
recovery
of
a
metal
from
its
ore
it
should
be
straightway
converted
to
the
shape
and
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
ultimately
intended
this
consideration
has
presented
itself
to
the
minds
of
some
of
the
manufacturers
of
aluminium
who
make
many
articles
intended
for
household
use
electrolytically
and
it
must
affect
many
other
trades
which
are
concerned
in
the
output
and
in
the
of
metals

susceptible
of
deposition

the
familiar
aneroid
barometer
furnishes
a
hint
for
another
convenient
form
of
small
in
seeking
to
cheapen
machinery
of
this
class
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
the
necessity
for
boring
out
cylinders
and
for
planing
and
other
expensive
work
should
be
avoided
in
the
aneroid
barometer
a
shallow
circular
box
is
fitted
with
a
cover
which
is
corrugated
in
concentric
circles
and
the
pressure
of
the
superincumbent
air
is
caused
to
depress
the
centre
of
this
cover
through
the
device
of
partially
exhausting
the
box
of
air
and
thus
diminishing
the
internal
resistance
to
the
slightly
moving
middle
part
of
the

affixed
a
lever
which
actuates
after
some
intermediate
action
the

moves
on
the
dial
to
indicate
by
its
record
of
variations
in
the

of

what
the
prospect
of

may
be
in

aneroid
form
of
the
the

immensely
widened
and
flattened
and
the
broad
circular
lid
with
its
spiral
corrugations
takes
the
place
of
the
piston
the
rod
which
acts
virtually
as
a
is
hollow
and
it
works
into
a
bearing
which
permits
the
steam
to
escape
when
the
extreme
point
of
the
stroke
has
been
reached
into
a
separate
condensing
chamber
kept
cool
with
water
the
boiler
itself
with
corrugated
top
may
take
the
place
of
the
cylinder
in
some
respects
this
little
machine
represents
a
retrograde
movement
even
from
watt
original
engine
with
its
separate
condenser
but
its
extreme
economy
of
first
cost
recommends
it
to
poor
producers
in
the
near
future
no
country
homestead
will
be
without
its
power
installation
of
one
kind
or
another
and
there
is
room
for
many
types
of
cheap
motors
a
motor
like
the
is
evidently
the
forerunner
of
other
engines
designed
to
utilise
the
force
of
an
emission
jet
of
vapour
or
gas
there
are
very
many
processes
in
which
gases
generated
by
chemical
combinations
are
permitted
to
escape
without
performing
any
services
not
even
that
of
giving
up
the
energy
which
they
may
be
made
to
store
up
when
held
in
compression
in
a
closed
vessel
the
reciprocating
forms
found
suitable
for
steam
and
gas
engines
are
hardly
adaptable
for
experiments
in
the
direction
of
economising
this
source
of
power
one
fatal
objection
in
the
majority
of
cases
being
the
corrosive
effects
of
the
gases
generated
upon
the
insides
of
cylinders
and
other
working
parts
as
soon
as
the
force
of
the
emission
jet
can
be
applied
as
a
factor
in
giving
motive
power
the
fact
that
no
parts
are
required
for
the
places
upon
which
the
line
of
force
impinges
will
alter
the
conditions
of
the
whole
problem
in
the
centrifugal
sand
pump
as
now
largely
used
for
raising
silt
from
rivers
and
harbours
the
serious
corrosive
action
of
the
jet
of
sand
and
water
upon
the
inside
of
the
pump
has
been
successfully
overcome
by
facing
the
metal
with
indiarubber
but
nothing
of
the
kind
could
have
been
done
if
the
working
of
the
apparatus
had
depended
on
the
motion
of
parts
as
in
the
ordinary
suction
or
lift
pump
as
an
instance
of
the
class
of
work
for
which
gaseous
jets
for
driving
turbines
or
similar
forms
of
motor
may
perform
useful
services
the
case
of
superphosphate
of
lime
may
be
cited
by
subjecting
bones
to
the
action
of
sulphuric
acid
the
farmer
may
manufacture
his
own
phosphatic
manures
for
the
enrichment
of
his
land
but
the
carbonic
dioxide
and
other
gases
generated
as
the
result
of
the
operation
are
wasted
therefore
it
at
present
pays
better
to
carry
the
bones
to
the
sulphuric
acid
than
to
reverse
the
procedure
by
conveying
the
acid
to
the
farm
where
the
bones
are
a
so
bulky
are
the
latter
however
that
serious
waste
of
labour
is
involved
in
transporting
them
for
long
distances
calculations
made
out
by
the
experts
of
various
state
agricultural
stations
show
that
as
a
general
rule
it
is
now
cheaper
for
the
farmer
to
buy
his
superphosphates
ready
made
than
to
make
them
on
his
farm
the
difference
in
some
cases
however
is
not
great
and
only
a
comparative
trifle
would
be
needed
in
order
to
turn
the
balance
this
may
probably
be
found
in
the
economic
value
of
the
service
rendered
by
a
or
other
device
for
utilising
the
expansive
power
of
the
gases
which
are
driven
from
the
constituents
of
the
bones
by
the
action
of
the
sulphuric
acid
for
pumping
water
and
other
ordinary
farm
operations
the
chemical
will
prove
very
handy
and
the
great
point
in
its
favour
will
be
that
instead
of
useless
cinders
the
refuse
from
it
will
consist
of
the
most
valuable
compost
with
which
the
farmer
can
dress
the
soil
enamelled
iron
will
be
employed
for
the
troughs
in
which
the
bones
and
acid
will
be
mixed
and
a
cover
similar
to
that
placed
over
a
papin
digester
will
be
clamped
to
the
rim
all
round
the
gases
being
liberated
only
in
the
form
of
a
jet
used
for
driving
machinery
for
very
small
motors
applicable
specially
to
domestic
purposes
such
as
ventilation
there
is
one
source
of
power
which
in
all
places
within
the
reticulation
areas
of
waterworks
may
be
had
practically
for
nothing
probably
when
the
owners
of
works
realise
that
they
have
command
of
something
which
is
of
commercial
value
although
hitherto
unnoticed
they
will
arrange
to
sell
not
only
the
water
which
they
supply
but
also
the
power
which
can
be
generated
by
its
escape
when
utilised
and
by
the
variations
in
the
pressure
from
hour
to
hour
and
even
from
minute
to
minute
the
latter
for
such
purposes
as
ventilation
for
instance
will
no
doubt
come
to
the
front
sooner
than
the
intermittent
power
now
wasted
by
the
outflowing
of
water
a
power
which
is
comparatively
too
small
an
item
in
most
cases
to
compensate
for
the
outlay
and
trouble
of
arranging
for
the
storage
of
energy
but
in
the
case
of
the
variation
in
the
pressure
without
any
escape
of
water
at
all
no
such
disability
appears
experiments
conducted
in
several
of
the
larger
cities
of
england
with
various
types
of
water
meters
which
are
really
motors
on
a
small
scale
have
proved
the
practicability
of
obtaining
a
source
of
constant
power
from
what
may
be
termed
the
ebb
and
the
flow
of
pressure
within
the
pipes
of
a
water
supply
system
at
every
hour
of
the
day
there
is
a
marked
variation
in
the
quantity
of
water
that
is
being
drawn
away
by
consumers
and
consequently
a
rise
and
fall
in
the
degree
of
pressure
recorded
by
the
meter
in
an
apparatus
for
converting
the
power
derivable
from
this
source
to
useful
purposes

on
a
very
small
scale
analogous
to
that
which
has
already
been
described

gentle
pressure
every
movement
of
the
two

then
responded
to
by
a
continuous

motion

may
be

small
in
extent
to
include
even
as
much
as

it
is
important
that

numerous
as

conveniently
be

will
be
made
when
the
possibilities
of
producing
hard
and
smooth
wearing
surfaces
without
the
need

have
been
fully
investigated

mentioned

at

is
being
treated
for
the

of

for
developing
the

of

at

to
take
advantage
of
every

may
be
made

has
been
found
for
example
that
certain
kinds
of

placed
under
very
heavy
pressure
at
the
moment
when
passing
from
the
liquid
to
the
solid
condition

the
exact
form
of
the

in
which
they
are
placed
but

extremely
hard

comparison
with
the
same
alloy

permitted
to
solidify
without
pressure
the
example
of
the
cheap
watch
industry
may
be
cited
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
immensely
important
revolution
which
will
take
place
in
the
production
of
both
small
and
large
when
all
the
possibilities
of
electrotyping
casting
and
stamping
the
various
wearing

true
to
shape
and
size
have
been
fully
exploited
an
accurate
timekeeper
is
now
practically
within
the
reach
of
all
and
in
the
twentieth
century
no
one
who
requires
a
small
prime
motor
to
do
the
rough
work
about
home
or
farm
will
be
compelled
to
do
without
it
by
reason
of
poverty
unless
perhaps
he
is
absolutely
destitute
and
a
fit
subject
for
public
charity
many
domestic
industries
which
were
crushed
out
of
existence
during
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
will
therefore
be
resuscitated
the
dear
created
the
factory
system
and
brought
the
operatives
to
live
close
together
in
long
rows
of
unsightly
dwellings
but
the
cheap
engine
in
conjunction
with
the
motor
driven
by
transmitted
electricity
will
give
to
the
working
people
comparative
freedom
again
to
live
where
they
please

to
enjoy
the
legitimate
pleasures

of

chapter
road
and

the
existing
keen
rivalry
presents
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
instructive
mechanical
problems
which
are
left
still
unsolved
by
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
question
to
be
determined
is
not
so
much
whether
road
locomotion
by
means
of
mechanical
power
is
practicable
and
useful
for
of
course
that
point
has
been
settled
long
ago
indeed
it
would
have
been
recognised
as
settled
years
before
had
it
not
been
for
the
crass
legislation
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
since
which
deliberately
drove
the
first
off
the
road
in
order
to
ensure
the
undisturbed
supremacy
of
horse
traffic
the
real
point
at
issue
is
whether
a
motor
can
be
made
which
shall
furnish
power
for
purposes
of
road
locomotion
as
cheaply
and
conveniently
as
is
already
done
for
stationary
purposes
horse
traction
although
extremely
dear
possesses
one
qualification
which
until
the
present
day
has
enabled
it
to
outdistance
its
mechanical
competitors
upon
ordinary
roads
this
is
its
power
of
adapting
itself
by
special
effort
to
the
exigencies
caused
by
the
varying
nature
of
the
road
watch
a
team
of
horses
pulling
a
waggon
along
an
undulating
highway
with
level
stretches
of
easy
going
and
here
and
there
a
decline
or
a
steep
hill
there
is
a
continual
adjustment
of
the
strain
which
each
animal
puts
upon
itself
according
to
the
character
of
the
difficulties
which
must
be
surmounted
the
effort
varying
from
nothing
at
all
when
going
down
a
gentle
decline
up
to
the
almost
desperate
jerk
with
which
the
vehicle
is
taken
over
some
stony
part
right
on
the
brow
of
an
eminence
the
whip
cracks
and
by
threats
and
encouragements
the
driver
induces
each
horse
to
put
forth
for
one
brief
moment
an
effort
which
could
not
be
sustained
for
many
minutes
save
at
the
peril
of
utter
exhaustion
when
the
unit
of
nominal
was
fixed
at
per
minute
the
work
contemplated
in
the
arbitrary
standard
was
supposed
to
be
such
as
a
horse
could
go
on
performing
for
several
hours
it
was
of
course
well
recognised
that
any
good
upstanding
horse
if
urged
to
a
special
effort
could
perform
several
times
the
indicated
amount
of
work
in
a
minute
nevertheless
the
habit
of
reckoning
in
terms
of
a
unit
drawn
from
the
analogy
of
the
horse
undoubtedly
tended
for
many
years
to
obscure
the
essential
difference
between
the
natures
of
the
two
sources
of
power
railroads
were
built
with
the
object
of
rendering
as
uniform
as
possible
the
amount
of
power
required
to
transport
a
given
weight
of
goods
or
passengers
over
a
specified
distance
and
consequently
the
application
of
the
to
traffic
conducted
on
the
railway
line
was
a
success
many
inventors
at
once
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
by
making
some
fixed
allowance
for
the
greater
roughness
of
an
ordinary
road
they
would
be
able
to
construct
a
engine
that
would
suit
exactly
for
road
traffic
in
a
rough
and
rudimentary
way
an
attempt
to
provide
for
the
special
effort
required
at
steep
or
stony
places
was
made
by
the
introduction
of
a
kind
of
of
extraordinary
weight
proportionate
to
the
size
of
the
engine
and
the
same
object
was
aimed
at
by
increasing
the
power
of
the
engine
to
somewhere
near
the
limit
of
the
possible
special
requirements
the
consequence
was
the
evolution
of
an
immensely
ponderous
and
wasteful
machine
which
for
some
years
only
held
its
ground
within
the
domain
of
the
heavy
work
of
roadmaking
as
a
means
of
road
traction
the
was
for
half
a
century
almost
entirely
discomfited
and
routed
by
partly
owing
to
this
mechanical
defect
and
partly
as
we
have
seen
through
legislative
partisanship
the
explosive
type
of
engine
was
next
called
into
requisition
to
do
battle
against
the
living
competitor
of
the
engineer
handiwork
petroleum
and
alcohol
when
volatilised
and
mixed
with
air
in
due
proportion
form
explosive
mixtures
which
are
much
more
nearly
instantaneous
in
their
action
than
an
elastic
vapour
like
steam
held
under
pressure
in
a
boiler
and
liberated
to
perform
its
work
by
comparatively
slow
expansion
the
petroleum
engine
as
applied
to
the
automobile
does
its
work
in
a
series
of
jerks
which
provide
for
the
unequal
degrees
of
power
required
to
cope
with
the
unevenness
of
a
road
as
against
this
however
there
are
certain
grave
defects
due
mainly
to
the
use
of
highly
inflammable
oils
vapourised
at
high
temperatures
and
these
have
impressed
a
large
proportion
of
engineers
with
a
belief
that
in
the
long
run
either
electricity
or
steam
will
win
the
day
storage
batteries
are
well
adapted
for
meeting
the
exigencies
of
the
road
just
as
they
are
for
those
of
tramway
traffic
because
as
soon
as
an
extra
strain
is
to
be
met
there
is
always
the
resource
of
coupling
up
fresh
batteries
held
in
reserve
a
process
which
amounts
to
the
same
as
yoking
new
horses
to
the
vehicle
in
order
to
take
it
up
a
hill
in
practice
however
it
is
found
that
the
jerky
vibratory
motion
of
the
gasoline
automobile
provides
for
this
in
a
way
almost
as
convenient
although
not
so
pleasant
the
chance
of
the
being
largely
adopted
for
automobile
work
and
for
road
traffic
generally
depends
principally
on
the
prospects
of
inventing
a
form
of
cylinder
or
its
equivalent
which
will
enable
the
driver
to
couple
up
fresh
effective
working
parts
of
his
machinery
at
will
just
as
may
be
done
with
storage
batteries
a
new
form
of
steam
cylinder
designed
to
provide
for
this
need
will
outwardly
resemble
a
long
pipe
one
being
fixed
on
each
lower
side
of
the
vehicle
but
inwardly
it
will
be
divided
into
compartments
each
of
which
will
have
its
own
separate
piston
practically
there
will
thus
be
a
series
of
cylinders
having
one
running
through
them
all
but
each
having
its
own
piston
normally
this
machine
will
run
with
an
admission
of
steam
to
only
one
or
two
of
the
cylinders
but
when
extra
work
has
to
be
done
the
other
cylinders
will
be
called
into
requisition
by
the
opening
of
the
steam
valves
leading
to
them
provision
can
be
made
for
the
automatic
working
of
this
adjustment
by
the
introduction
of
a
spring
upon
the
so
arranged
that
as
soon
as
the
resistance
reaches
a
certain
point
a
lever
is
actuated
which
opens
the
valves
to
admit
steam
to
the
reserve
cylinders
of
the
engine
on
such
occasions
of
course
the
consumption
of
steam
must
necessarily
be
greatly
increased
but
on
the
other
hand
the
automatic
system
of
the
admission
to
each
cylinder
also
results
in
a
shutting
off
of
the
steam
when
little
or
no
work
is
required
in
fact
with
a
fully
automatic
action
regulating
the
consumption
of
steam
exactly
according
to
the
amount
of
force
necessary
to
drive
the
automobile
it
would
be
possible
to
work
even
a
single
cylinder
to
much
greater
advantage
than
is
done
by
the
machines
generally
in
use
so
heavy
are
the
storage
batteries
needed
for
electric
traction
of
the
road
that
practically
it
is
not
found
convenient
to
carry
enough
of
cells
to
last
for
more
than
a
run
the
batteries
must
then
either
be
replaced
or
a
delay
of
some
three
hours
must
occur
while
they
are
being
recharged
the
idea
of
establishing
charging
stations
at
almost
every
conceivable
terminus
of
a
run
is
quite
chimerical
and
even
if
hundreds
of
such
stations
were
provided
for
the
convenience
of
the
users
of
electric
traction
the
limitation
imposed
by
being
forced
to
follow
the
established
routes
would
always
give
to
the
motor
an
advantage
over
its
competitor
the
best
hope
for
the
storage
battery
on
the
automobile
rests
upon
its
convenience
as
a
repository
of
reserve
power
in
conjunction
with
such
a
prime
motor
as
the
a
turbine
worked
by
a
jet
of
steam
as
already
described
and
moving
in
a
magnetic
field
to
generate
electricity
for
storage
in
a
few
cells
is
a
convenient
form
in
which
steam
and
electricity
can
be
yoked
together
in
order
to
secure
a
power
of
just
the
type
suitable
for
driving
an
automobile
in
the
machine
indicated
the
supply
of
the
motive
power
is
direct
from
the
storage
batteries
which
can
be
coupled
up
in
any
required
number
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
road
automatic
gear
may
be
introduced
by
an
adaptation
of
the
principle
already
referred
to
in
a
light
for
carrying
one
or
two
persons
on
holiday
trips
or
business
rounds
the
quality
of
adaptability
of
the
source
of
power
to
the
sudden
demands
due
to
differences
of
level
in
the
road
is
not
so
absolutely
essential
as
it
is
in
traction
engines
designed
for
the
transport
of
goods
over
ordinary
roads
in
the
former
class
of
work
the
waste
of
power
involved
in
employing
a
motor
of
strength
sufficient
to
climb
hills
although
the
bulk
of
the
distance
to
be
travelled
is
along
level
roads
may
not
be
at
all
so
serious
as
to
overbalance
the
many
and
manifest
advantages
of
the
automobile
principle
at
the
same
time
as
has
already
been
indicated
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
when
proper
automatic
contrivances
have
been
applied
for
economising
mechanical
energy
in
the
passenger
an
immense
impetus
will
be
given
to
its
advancement
in
the
road
the
need
for
what
may
be
termed
on
the
part
of
the
mechanism
is
much
greater
more
especially
as
the
competition
against
is
conducted
on
terms
so
much
more
nearly
level
a
team
of
strong
driven
by
one
man
on
a
waggon
is
a
far
more
economical
installation
of
power
than
a
buggy
carrying
one
or
two
passengers
the
asphalt
and
macadamised
tracks
which
are
now
being
laid
down
along
the
sides
of
roads
for
the
convenience
of
cyclists
are
the
significant
forerunners
of
an
improvement
destined
to
produce
a
revolution
in
road
traffic
during
the
twentieth
century
when
automobiles
have
become
very
much
more
numerous
and
local
authorities
find
that
the
settlement
of
wealthy
or
comparatively
families
in
their
neighbourhoods
may
depend
very
largely
upon
the
question
whether
light
traffic
may
be
conveniently
conducted
to
and
from
the
nearest
city
an
immense
impetus
will
be
administered
to
the
reasonable
efforts
made
for
catering
for
the
demand
for
tracks
for
the
accommodation
of
automobiles
both
private
and
public
the
tyranny
of
the
railway
station
will
then
be
to
a
large
extent
mitigated
and
suburban
or
country
residents
will
no
longer
be
practically
compelled
to
crowd
up
close
to
each
station
on
their
lines
of
railroad
under
existing
conditions
many
of
those
who
travel
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
to
business
every
day
live
just
as
close
to
one
another
and
with
nearly
as
marked
a
lack
of
space
for
lawn
and
garden
as
if
they
lived
within
the
city
the
bunchy
nature
of
settlement
promoted
by
railways
must
have
excited
the
notice
of
any
intelligent
observer
during
the
past
twenty
or
thirty
years
that
is
to
say
since
the
suburban
railroad
began
to
take
its
place
as
an
important
factor
in
determining
the
locating
of
population
to
a
very
large
extent
the
automobile
will
be
rather
a
feeder
to
the
railway
than
a
rival
to
it
and
all
sorts
of
and
country
lanes
will
be
improved
and
adapted
so
as
to
admit
of
residents
running
into
their
stations
by
their
own
and
then
completing
their
journeys
by
rail
but
when
this
point
has
been
reached
and
when
fairly
smooth
tracks
adapted
for
automobile
and
cycling
traffic
have
been
laid
down
all
over
the
country
a
very
interesting
question
will
crop
up
having
reference
to
the
practicability
of
converting
these
tracks
into
highways
combining
the
capabilities
both
of
roads
and
of
railways
in
an
ordinary
railroad
the
functions
of
the
iron
or
steel
rails
are
twofold
first
to
carry
the
weight
of
the
load
and
second
to
guide
the
engine
carriage
or
truck
in
the
right
direction
now
the
latter
purpose
in
the
case
of
a
never
used
for
high
speeds
especially
in
going
round
curves
might
be
served
by
the
adoption
of
a
very
much
lighter
weight
of
rail
if
only
the
carrying
of
the
load
could
be
otherwise
provided
for
in
fact
if
wheels
running
on
a
fairly
smooth
asphalt
track
were
employed
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
vehicle
there
would
then
be
no
need
for
more
than
one
which
might
readily
be
fixed
in
the
middle
of
the
track
but
this
should
preferably
be
made
to
resemble
the
rail
of
a
tram
rather
than
that
of
a
railroad
every
man
his
own
will
be
a
rule
which
will
undoubtedly
require
some
little
social
and
mechanical
adjustment
to
carry
out
within
the
limits
of
the
public
safety
but
the
automobile
even
in
its
existing
form
makes
the
task
of
completing
this
adjustment
practically
a
certainty
of
the
near
future
and
as
soon
as
it
is
seen
that
motor
tracks
with
guide
lines
render
traffic
safer
than
it
is
on
ordinary
roads
the
main
objections
to
the
innovation
will
be
rapidly
overcome
the
rule
of
the
road
for
such
tracks
will
probably
be
based
very
closely
on
that
which
at
present
exists
for
ordinary
thoroughfares
on
those
roads
where
two
tracks
have
been
laid
down
each
motor
will
be
required
to
keep
to
the
left
and
when
a
traveller
coming
up
behind
is
impatient
at
the
slow
rate
of
speed
adopted
by
his
precursor
he
will
be
compelled
to
make
the
necessary
détour
himself
passing
into
the
middle
of
the
thoroughfare
and
there
outstripping
the
party
in
front
without
the
assistance
of
the
and
rejoining
the
track
to
execute
this
movement
of
course
the
motor
wheels
for
the
must
be
mounted
on
entirely
different
principles
from
those
adapted
for
railroad
traffic
the
broad
and
soft
tyred
wheels
which
bear
upon
the
asphalt
track
will
be
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
carrying
the
machine
without
extraneous
aid
but
there
will
be
two
extra
wheels
one
in
front
and
one
at
the
rear
capable
of
being
lifted
at
any
time
by
means
of
a
lever
controlled
by
the
driver
these
guiding
wheels
will
fit
into
the
groove
of
the
tram
line
in
the
centre
being
made
of
a
shape
suitable
for
enabling
the
driver
to
pick
up
the
groove
quickly
whenever
he
pleases
the
carrying
wheels
of
the
vehicle
in
this
system
are
enabled
to
pass
over
the
readily
because
the
latter
does
not
stand
up
from
the
track
like
the
line
in
a
railroad
a
simpler
plan
particularly
adapted
for
roads
which
are
to
have
only
a
single
is
to
place
the
rail
at
the
of
the
track
and
to
raise
it
a
few
inches
from
the
ground
the
wheels
for
the
rail
are
attached
to
arms
which
can
be
raised
and
lifted
off
the
rail
by
the
driver
operating
a
lever
guiding
irons
forming
an
inverted
y
are
placed
below
the
bearings
of
the
wheels
to
facilitate
the
picking
up
of
the
rail
their
effect
being
that
if
the
driver
places
his
vehicle
in
approximately
the
position
for
engaging
the
side
wheels
with
the
rail
and
then
goes
slowly
ahead
he
will
very
quickly
be
drawn
into
the
correct
alignment
of
course
the
rails
for
this
kind
of
track
can
be
very
light
and
inexpensive
in
comparison
with
those
required
for
railroads
on
which
the
whole
weight
of
each
vehicle
as
well
as
the
lateral
strain
caused
by
its
guidance
must
fall
upon
the
rail
itself
the
asphalt
track
and
its
equivalent
will
be
the
means
of
bringing
much
nearer
to
fulfilment
the
dream
of
having
a
railway
to
every
man
door
many
such
tracks
will
be
equipped
with
electric
cables
as
well
as
so
that
cars
with
electric
motors
will
be
available
for
running
on
them
and
the
power
will
be
supplied
from
a
station
some
difficulty
may
at
first
be
experienced
in
adjusting
the
rates
and
modes
of
payment
for
the
facilities
thus
offered
but
a
convenient
precedent
is
present
to
hand
in
the
class
of
enactment
under
which
tramway
companies
are
at
present
protected
from
having
their
permanent
ways
used
by
vehicles
owned
by
other
persons
practically
the
possession
of
a
vehicle
having
a
flanged
wheel
and
a
gauge
exactly
the
same
as
that
of
the
tram
lines
in
the
vicinity
may
be
taken
to
indicate
an
intention
to
use
the
lines
similarly
a
certain
relation
between
the
positions
of
guiding
wheels
and
those
of
the
connections
with
cables
may
be
held
to
furnish
evidence
of
liability
to
contribute
towards
the
maintenance
of
roads
and
railways
will
be
much
more
closely
in
the
future
than
they
have
been
in
the
past
the
competition
of
the
automobile
would
in
itself
be
practically
sufficient
to
force
the
owners
of
railways
into
a
more
adaptive
mood
in
regard
to
the
true
relations
between
the
world
great
highways
the
way
in
which
the
course
of
evolution
will
work
the
problem
out
may
be
indicated
thus
first
the
owners
of
automobiles
will
find
it
convenient
in
many
instances
to
run
by
road
to
the
nearest
railway
station
which
suits
their
purposes
leaving
their
machines
in
charge
of
the
stationmaster
and
going
on
by
train
in
course
of
time
the
owners
of
omnibus
automobiles
will
desire
to
secure
the
same
advantage
for
their
customers
and
on
this
account
the
road
cars
will
await
the
arrival
and
departure
of
every
train
just
as
horse
vehicles
do
at
present
the
next
step
will
be
taken
by
the
railway
companies
or
by
the
local
authorities
when
it
becomes
obvious
that
there
is
much
more
profit
in
motor
traffic
than
there
ever
was
in
catering
for
the
public
by
means
of
vehicles
drawn
by
horses
each
important
railway
station
will
have
its
diverging
lines
of
for
the
convenience
of
passengers
some
of
them
owned
and
managed
by
the
same
authority
as
the
railway
line
itself
rivalry
will
shortly
enforce
an
improvement
upon
this
system
because
in
the
keen
competition
between
railway
lines
those
stations
will
attract
the
best
parts
of
the
trade
at
which
the
passengers
are
put
to
the
smallest
amount
of
inconvenience
the
necessity
for
changing
trains
with
its
attendant
bustle
of
looking
after
luggage
perhaps
during
very
inclement
weather
always
acts
as
a
hindrance
to
the
popularity
of
a
line
when
are
running
by
road
all
the
way
into
the
city
setting
people
down
almost
at
their
doors
and
making
wide
circuits
by
road
the
proprietors
of
these
vehicles
will
make
the
most
of
their
advantages
in
offering
to
travellers
a
cosy
and
comfortable
retreat
during
the
whole
of
their
journey
comfortably
furnished
will
therefore
be
mounted
upon
low
railway
trucks
of
special
construction
designed
to
permit
of
their
being
run
on
and
off
the
trucks
from
the
level
of
the
ground
the
plan
of
mounting
a
road
vehicle
upon
a
truck
suited
to
receive
it
has
already
been
adopted
for
some
purposes
notably
for
the
removal
of
furniture
and
similar
goods
and
it
is
capable
of
immense
extension
an
express
train
will
run
through
on
the
leading
routes
from
which
roads
branch
out
in
all
directions
and
as
it
approaches
each
station
it
will
uncouple
the
truck
and
intended
for
that
destination
the
latter
will
be
shunted
on
to
a
loopline
the
will
be
set
free
from
its
truck
and
will
then
proceed
on
its
journey
by
road
when
a
similar
system
has
been
fully
adapted
for
the
conveyance
of
goods
by
rail
and
road
experiments
will
then
be
commenced
on
a
systematic
basis
with
the
object
of
rendering
possible
the
picking
up
of
packages
and
even
of
vehicles
without
stopping
the
train
the
most
pressing
problem
which
now
awaits
solution
in
the
railway
world
is
how
to
serve
roadside
stations
by
express
trains
through
passengers
demand
a
rapid
service
while
the
roadside
traffic
goes
largely
to
the
line
that
offers
the
most
frequent
trains
in
the
violent
strain
and
effort
to
combine
these
two
desiderata
the
most
successful
means
yet
adopted
have
been
those
which
rely
upon
the
destruction
of
enormous
quantities
of
costly
by
means
of
brakes
the
amount
of
power
daily
converted
into
the
mischievous
heat
of
friction
by
the
brakes
on
some
lines
of
railway
would
suffice
to
work
the
whole
of
the
traffic
several
times
over
but
the
sacrifice
has
been
enforced
by
the
public
demand
for
a
train
that
shall
run
fast
and
shall
yet
stop
as
frequently
as
possible
progress
in
this
direction
has
reached
its
limit
a
brake
that
shall
conserve
instead
of
destroying
the
power
of
the
train
inertia
on
pulling
up
at
a
station
is
urgently
required
but
the
efforts
towards
supplying
the
want
have
not
so
far
proved
very
successful
each
carriage
or
truck
must
be
fitted
with
an
so
arranged
that
on
the
application
of
the
brake
by
the
it
shall
drive
back
a
corresponding
amount
of
air
to
that
which
has
been
liberated
from
the
reservoir
and
the
energy
thus
stored
must
be
rendered
available
for
the
train
trials
in
this
direction
have
been
made
through
the
application
of
strong
springs
which
are
caused
to
engage
upon
the
wheels
when
the
brake
is
applied
and
thus
are
wound
up
but
which
may
then
be
reversed
in
position
so
that
for
the
starting
of
the
vehicle
the
rebound
of
the
spring
offers
material
assistance
it
is
obvious
however
that
the
use
of
compressed
air
harmonises
better
with
the
railway
system
than
any
plan
depending
upon
springs
the
potential
elasticity
in
an
of
portable
dimensions
is
enormously
greater
than
that
of
any
metallic
spring
which
could
conveniently
be
carried
in
picking
up
and
setting
down
a
system
has
been
for
some
years
in
operation
on
certain
railway
lines
indicating
in
a
small
way
the
possibilities
of
the
future
in
the
direction
of
obviating
the
need
for
stopping
trains
at
stations
the
bag
is
hung
on
a
sliding
rod
outside
of
the
platform
and
on
a
corresponding
part
of
the
van
is
affixed
a
strong
net
which
comes
in
contact
with
the
bag
and
catches
it
while
the
train
goes
past
at
full
speed
dropping
a
bag
is
of
course
a
simpler
matter
the
occasionally
urgent
demand
for
the
sending
of
parcels
in
a
similar
manner
has
set
many
inventive
brains
to
work
on
the
problem
of
extending
the
possibilities
of
this
system
and
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
that
before
long
it
will
be
practicable
to
load
some
classes
of
small
and
not
readily
broken
articles
into
trucks
or
vans
while
trains
are
in
motion
the
root
idea
from
which
such
an
invention
will
spring
may
be
borrowed
from
the
sliding
rail
and
tobogganing
devices
already
introduced
in
pleasure
grounds
for
the
amusement
of
those
who
enjoy
trying
every
novel
excitement
a
light
and
very
small
truck
may
be
caused
to
run
down
an
incline
and
to
throw
itself
into
one
of
the
trucks
comprising
a
goods
train
the
method
of
timing
the
descent
of
course
will
only
be
definitely
ascertained
after
careful
calculation
and
experiments
designed
to
determine
what
length
of
time
must
elapse
between
the
liberation
of
the
small
descending
truck
and
the
passing
of
the
vehicle
into
which
its
contents
are
to
be
projected
over
railway
lines
at
wayside
stations
will
afford
the
first
conveniences
to
serve
as
tentative
appliances
for
the
purpose
indicated
from
the
overway
of
the
bridge

built
out
two
light
frameworks
carrying
small
which
are
set
at
sharp
declivities
in
the
directions
of
the
up
and
the
down
trains
respectively
and
which
terminate
at
a
point
just
high
enough
to
clear
the
of
the

the
small
truck
into
which
the
goods
to
be
loaded
are
stowed
with
suitable
packings
to
prevent
undue
concussion
is
held
at
the
top
of
its
course
by
a
catch
readily
released
by
pressure
on
a
lever
from
below
the
guard
van
is
provided
at
its
front
end
with
a
steel
upright
rod
carrying
a
which
is
easily
elevated
by
the
guard
or
his
assistant
in
anticipation
of
passing
any
station
where
parcels
are
to
be
received
by
projection
at
the
rear
of
the
van
is
an
open
receptacle
communicating
by
a
door
or
window
with
the
van
itself
at
the
instant
when
the
steel
comes
in
contact
with
the
lever
of
the
catch
which
holds
the
little
truck
in
position
on
the
elevated
footbridge
the
descent
begins
and
by
the
time
that
the
receptacle
behind
the
van
has
come
directly
under
the
end
of
the
sloping
track
the
truck
has
reached
the
latter
point
and
is
brought
to
a
sudden
standstill
by
buffers
at
the
termination
of
the
miniature
toboggan
the
ends
of
the
little
truck
being
left
open
its
contents
are
discharged
into
the
receptacle
behind
the
van
from
which
the
guard
or
assistant
in
charge
removes
them
into
the
vehicle
itself
for
catching
the
parcels
thrown
out
from
the
van
a
much
simpler
set
of
apparatus
is
sufficient
on
a
larger
scale
no
doubt
in
course
of
time
a
somewhat
similar
plan
will
be
brought
into
operation
for
causing
loaded
trucks
to
run
from
elevated
sidings
and
to
join
themselves
on
to
trains
in
motion
one
essential
condition
for
the
attainment
of
this
object
is
that
the
rails
of
the
siding
should
be
set
at
such
a
steep
declivity
that
when
the
last
van
of
the
passing
train
has
cleared
the
points
and
set
the
waiting
truck
in
motion
by
liberating
its
catch
the
rate
of
speed
attained
by
the
pursuing
vehicle
should
be
sufficiently
high
to
enable
it
to
catch
the
train
by
its
own
impetus
it
may
be
found
more
convenient
on
some
lines
to
provide
nearly
level
sidings
and
to
impart
the
necessary
momentum
to
the
waiting
truck
partly
through
the
propelling
agency
of
compressed
air
any
project
for
what
will
be
described
as
shooting
a
truck
loaded
with
valuable
goods
after
the
retreating
end
of
a
train
in
order
to
cause
it
to
catch
up
with
the
moving
vehicles
will
no
doubt
give
rise
to
alarm
and
this
feeling
will
be
intensified
when
further
proposals
for
projecting
carriages
full
of
passengers
in
a
similar
method
come
up
for
discussion
but
these
apprehensions
will
be
met
and
answered
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
critics
of
what
was
called
stephenson
mad
scheme
of
making
trains
run
twenty
or
even
thirty
miles
an
hour
were
gradually
induced
to
calm
their
nerves
sufficiently
to
try
the
new
experience
of
a
train
journey
the
tramway
has
hitherto
been
used
principally
in
connection
with
mines
situated
in
very
hilly
localities
trestles
are
erected
at
intervals
upon
which
a
strong
steel
rope
is
stretched
and
this
carries
the
buckets
or
trucks
slung
on
contrived
so
as
to
pass
the
supports
without
interference
a
system
of
this
kind
can
be
worked
electrically
the
being
employed
also
for
the
conveyance
of
the
current
but
an
inherent
defect
in
the
principle
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
dips
deeply
when
the
weight
passes
over
it
and
thus
the
progress
from
one
support
to
another
resolves
itself
into
a
series
of
sharp
descents
followed
by
equally
sharp
ascents
up
a
corresponding
incline
the
usual
way
of
working
the
traffic
is
to
haul
the
freight
by
means
of
a
rope
wound
round
a
windlass
driven
by
a
stationary
engine
at
the
end
the
constantly
varying
strain
on
the
cable
proves
how
large
is
the
amount
of
power
that
must
be
wasted
in
jerking
the
buckets
up
one
incline
to
let
them
jolt
down
another
when
the
point
of
support
has
been
passed
hitherto
the
tramway
has
been
usually
adopted
merely
as
presenting
the
lesser
of
two
evils
if
the
nature
of
the
hills
to
be
traversed
be
so
precipitous
that
ruinous
cuttings
and
bridges
would
be
needed
for
the
construction
of
an
ordinary
railway
or
tramway
line
the
idea
of
conveyance
by
wire
suggests
itself
as
being
at
least
a
temporary
mode
of
getting
over
the
difficulty
but
a
great
extension
of
the
principle
of
overhead
haulage
may
be
expected
as
soon
as
the
dipping
of
the
load
has
been
obviated
and
the
portion
of
the
moving
line
upon
which
it
is
situated
has
been
made
rigid
a
strong
but
light
steel
framework
placed
in
the
line
of
the
and
of
sufficient
length
to
reach
across
two
of
the
intervals
between
the
supports
may
be
drawn
over
enlarged
pulleys
and
remain
quite
rigid
all
the
time
the
is
thus
dispensed
with
and
the
installation
acquires
a
new
character
becoming
in
point
of
fact
a
moving
bridge
which
is
drawn
across
its
supports
and
fits
into
the
grooves
in
the
wheels
surmounting
the
latter
the
carriage
or
truck
may
be
constructed
on
the
plan
adopted
for
the
building
of
the
longest
type
of
modern
bogie
carriages
for
ordinary
railways
the
tensile
strength
of
steel
rods
being
largely
utilised
for
imparting
rigidity
we
now
find
that
instead
of
a
railway
we
have
the
idea
of
what
may
be
more
appropriately
called
a
wheelway
the
primitive
application
of
the
same
principle
is
to
be
seen
in
the
devices
used
in
dockyards
and
workshops
for
moving
heavy
weights
along
the
ground
by
skidding
them
on
rollers
practically
the
main
precaution
observed
in
carrying
out
this
operation
is
the
taking
care
that
no
two
rollers
are
put
so
far
apart
that
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
object
to
be
conveyed
shall
have
passed
over
one
before
the
end
has
come
in
contact
with
the
next
just
ahead
of
it
the
wheelway
itself
will
be
economical
in
proportion
as
the
length
of
the
rigid
carriage
or
truck
which
runs
upon
it
is
increased
the
carrying
of
cheap
freight
will
be
the
special
province
of
the
apparatus
and
it
will
therefore
be
an
object
to
secure
the
form
of
truck
which
will
give
with
the
least
expense
the
greatest
degree
of
rigidity
over
the
longest
stretch
of
span
from
one
support
to
another
some
modification
of
the
tubular
principle
will
probably
supply
the
most
promising
form
for
the
purpose
the
hope
of
this
will
be
greatly
enhanced
through
the
recent
advances
in
the
art
of
by
which
and
tough
steel
tubes
can
be
made
quite
seamless
and
jointless
being
practically
forged
at
one
operation
in
the
required
tubular
shape
for
mining
and
other
similar
purposes
the
long
tubal
wheelway
trucks
of
this
description
can
be
drawn
up
an
incline
at
the
loading
station
so
as
to
be
partially
in
position
for
receiving
the
charges
or
loads
of
mineral
or
other
freight
after
this
they
can
be
despatched
along
the
wheelway
on
the
closing
of
the
door
at
the
loading
end
in
regard
to
the
mode
of
application
of
the
power
in
traction
the
lines
may
serve
their
objects
well
enough
by
adopting
the
endless
system
at
present
used
on
many
mining
properties
but
it
is
found
in
practice
that
for
heavy
freight
this
endless
cable
traction
does
not
suit
over
distances
of
more
than
about
two
miles
mining
men
insist
upon
the
caution
that
where
this
length
of
distance
has
to
be
exceeded
in
the
haulage
of
ore
from
the
mine
over
tramways
there
is
need
for
two
installations
the
loaded
trucks
being
passed
along
from
one
to
the
other
by
means
of
suitable
appliances
at
the
termini
electric
traction
must
in
the
near
future
displace
such
a
cumbrous
system
and
the
plan
upon
which
it
will
be
applied
will
probably
depend
upon
the
use
of
a
steel
cable
along
which
the
must
haul
itself
in
its
progress
this
cable
will
be
kept
stationary
but
gripped
by
the
wheels
and
other
appliances
of
the
electric
motors
with
which
the
long
trucks
are
provided
besides
this
there
must
also
be
the
conducting
cables
for
the
conveyance
of
the
electric
current
for
cheap
means
of
transport
in
country
as
well
as
in
regions
of
an
exceptionally
hilly
contour
the
wheelway
has
a
great
future
before
it
ultimately
the
system
can
be
worked
out
so
as
to
present
an
almost
exact
converse
of
the
railway
the
rails
are
fixed
on
the
lower
part
of
the
elongated
truck
one
on
each
side
while
the
wheels
placed
at
intervals
upon
suitable
supports
constitute
the
permanent
way
the
amount
of
constructional
work
required
for
each
mile
of
track
under
this
plan
is
a
mere
fraction
of
that
which
is
needed
for
the
permanent
way
and
rolling
stock
of
a
railway
the
almost
entire
absence
of
being
of
course
a
most
important
source
of
economy
probably
the
development
of
transport
on
the
principles
indicated
by
the
evolution
of
the
ropeway
or
tramway
will
take
place
primarily
in
connection
with
mining
properties
and
for
general
transport
purposes
in
country
of
a
nature
which
renders
it
unsuitable
for
railway
construction
this
applies
not
merely
to
hilly
regions
but
particularly
to
those
long
stretches
of
sandy
country
which
impede
the
transport
of
traffic
in
many
rich
mining
regions
and
in
patches
separating
good
country
from
the
seaboard
in
the
wheelway
for
land
of
this
character
the
wheels
need
not
be
elevated
more
than
a
very
few
feet
above
the
ground
just
enough
to
keep
them
clear
of
the
drift
sand
which
in
some
places
is
fatal
to
the
carrying
out
of
any
ordinary
railway
project
the
conception
of
a
truck
or
other
vehicle
that
shall
practically
carry
its
own
has
been
an
attractive
one
to
some
inventive
minds
in
sandy
regions
and
in
other
places
where
a
railway
track
is
difficult
to
maintain
and
where
at
any
rate
there
would
hardly
be
sufficient
traffic
to
encourage
expenditure
in
laying
an
iron
road
a
very
great
boon
would
be
a
kind
of
motor
which
would
lay
its
own
rails
in
front
of
its
wheels
and
pick
them
up
again
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
a
carriage
of
this
kind
was
worked
for
some
time
on
the
landes
in
france
the
track
was
virtually
a
kind
of
endless
band
which
ran
round
the
four
wheels
bearing
a
close
resemblance
to
the
ramp
upon
which
the
horse
is
made
to
tread
in
the
box
type
of
several
somewhat
similar
devices
have
been
brought
out
and
a
gradual
approach
seems
to
have
been
made
towards
a
serviceable
vehicle
a
large
wheel
offers
less
resistance
to
the
traction
of
the
weight
upon
it
than
a
small
one
the
principal
reason
for
this
is
that
its
outer
periphery
being
at
any
particular
point
comparatively
straight
does
not
dip
down
into
every
hollow
of
the
road
but
strikes
an
average
of
the
depressions
and
prominences
which
it
meets
the
pneumatic
tyre
accomplishes
the
same
object
although
in
a
different
way
the
weight
being
supported
by
an
elastic
surface
which
fits
into
the
contour
of
the
ground
beneath
it
and
the
downward
pressure
being
balanced
by
the
sum
total
of
all
the
resistant
forces
offered
by
every
part
of
the
tyre
which
touches
the
ground
whether
resting
on
hollows
or
on
prominences
careful
tests
which
have
been
made
with
vehicles
by
means
of
various
types
of
dynamometer
have
proved
that
altogether
apart
from
the
question
of
comfort
arising
from
absence
of
vibration
there
is
a
very
true
and
real
saving
of
actual
power
in
the
driving
of
a
vehicle
on
wheels
fitted
with
inflated
tubes
as
compared
with
the
quantity
that
is
required
to
propel
the
same
vehicle
when
resting
on
wheels
having
hard
unyielding
rims
so
far
as
cycles
and
are
concerned
this
is
the
best
solution
of
the
problem
of
averaging
the
inequalities
of
a
road
that
has
yet
been
presented
but
when
we
come
to
consider
the
making
of
provision
for
goods
traffic
carried
by
traction
engines
along
ordinary
roadways
the
difficulties
which
present
themselves
militating
against
the
adoption
of
the
pneumatic
principle
at
any
rate
so
long
as
a
cheap
substitute
for
is
undiscovered
are
practically
insurmountable
large
cart
wheels
of
the
ordinary
type
are
much
more
difficult
to
construct
than
small
ones
besides
being
more
liable
to
get
out
of
order
the
advantages
of
a
large
over
a
small
wheel
in
reducing
the
amount
of
resistance
offered
by
rough
roads
have
long
been
recognised
and
the
limit
of
height
was
soon
attained
in
looking
for
improvement
in
this
direction
therefore
we
must
inquire
what
new
types
of
wheel
may
be
suggested
and
whether
an
intermediate
plan
between
the
endless
band
as
already
referred
to
and
the
large
wheel
may
not
find
a
useful
place
let
the
wheel
consist
of
a
very
small
running
on
the
inside
of
a
large
rigid
steel
hoop
the
latter
must
be
supported
to
keep
it
from
falling
to
either
side
by
means
of
a
steel
framework
rising
from
the
sides
of
the
vehicle
and
carrying
small
wheels
to
prevent
friction
we
now
have
a
kind
of
rail
which
conforms
to
the
condition
already
mentioned
namely
that
of
being
capable
of
being
laid
down
in
front
of
the
wheel
of
the
truck
or
vehicle
and
of
being
picked
up
again
when
the
weight
has
passed
over
any
particular
part
the
hoop
in
fact
constitutes
a
rolling
railway
and
the
larger
it
can
with
convenience
be
made
the
nearer
is
the
approach
which
it
presents
to
a
straight
railway
track
as
regards
the
absence
of
resistance
to
the
passing
of
a
loaded
over
it
the
method
of
applying
the
rolling
hoop
more
particularly
as
regards
the
question
whether
two
or
four
shall
be
used
for
a
vehicle
will
depend
upon
the
special
work
to
be
performed
some
vehicles
however
will
have
only
two
hoops
one
on
each
side
but
several
small
running
on
the
inside
of
each
a
vehicle
of
this
pattern
is
not
to
be
classed
with
a
buggy
because
it
will
maintain
its
equilibrium
without
being
held
in
position
by
shafts
or
other
similar
means
so
far
as
contact
with
the
road
is
concerned
it
is
and
yet
in
its
relation
to
the
force
of
gravitation
upon
which
its
statical
stability
depends
it
is
a
four
or
according
to
the
number
of
the
small
with
which
it
is
fitted
traction
engines
carrying
hoops
twenty
feet
in
height
or
at
any
rate
as
high
as
may
be
found
compatible
with
stability
when
referred
to
the
available
width
on
the
road
will
be
capable
of
transporting
goods
at
a
cost
much
below
that
of
horse
traction
the
limit
of
available
height
may
be
increased
by
the
bringing
of
the
two
hoops
closer
to
each
other
at
the
top
than
they
are
at
the
roadway
because
the
application
of
the
principle
does
not
demand
that
the
hoops
should
stand
absolutely
erect
similar
means
will
no
doubt
be
tried
for
the
achievement
of
a
modified
form
of
what
has
been
dreamt
of
by
cyclists
under
the
name
of
a
unicycle
this
machine
will
resemble
a
bicycle
running
on
the
inner
rim
of
a
hoop
and
will
probably
attain
to
a
higher
speed
for
show
purposes
than
the
safety
bicycle
of
the
usual
pattern
but
it
is
in
the
development
of
goods
traffic
along
ordinary
roads
that
the
principle
will
make
its
most
noticeable
progress
by
its
agency
not
only
will
the
transport
of
goods
along
roads
become
less
costly
and
more
expeditious
but
localities
in
sparsely
settled
countries
such
as
those
beyond
the
missouri
in
america
and
the
interior
regions
of
south
africa
australia
and
china
will
become
much
more
readily
accessible
a
and
automobile
which
can
run
across
broad
almost
trackless
plains
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
miles
an
hour
will
bring
within
quick
reach
of
civilisation
many
localities
in
which
at
present
for
lack
of
such
communication
rough
men
are
apt
to
grow
into
while
those
who
retain
the
instincts
of
civilisation
look
upon
their
exile
as
a
living
death
it
will
do
more
to
enlighten
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
than
any
other
mechanical
agency
of
the
twentieth
century
chapter
vi
ships
the
cargo
slave
and
the
ocean
greyhound
are
already
differentiated
by
marked
characteristics
and
in
the
twentieth
century
the
divergence
between
the
two
types
of
vessels
will
become
much
accentuated
the
object
aimed
at
by
the
owners
of
cargo
boats
will
be
to
secure
the
greatest
possible
economy
of
working
combined
with
a
moderately
good
rate
of
speed
such
as
may
ensure
shippers
against
having
to
stand
out
of
their
capital
locked
up
in
the
cargo
for
too
long
a
period
hence
cheap
power
will
become
increasingly
a
desideratum
and
the
possible
applications
of
natural
sources
of
energy
will
be
keenly
scrutinised
with
a
view
to
turning
any
feasible
plan
to
advantage
the
sailing
ship
and
the
economic
and
constructive
lines
upon
which
it
is
built
and
worked
will
be
carefully
overhauled
with
a
view
to
finding
how
its
deficiencies
may
be
supplemented
and
its
good
points
turned
to
account
one
result
of
this
renewed
attention
will
be
to
confirm
for
some
little
time
the
movement
which
showed
itself
during
the
past
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
for
an
increase
of
sailing
tonnage
sooner
or
later
however
it
will
be
recognised
that
sail
power
must
be
largely
supplemented
even
on
the
sailer
if
it
is
to
hold
its
own
against
steam
for
mails
and
passengers
on
the
other
hand
steam
must
more
and
more
decidedly
assert
its
supremacy
yet
the
of
the
twentieth
century
will
be
very
different
from
packets
which
have
made
the
running
towards
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
she
will
carry
little
or
no
cargo
excepting
specie
and
goods
of
exceptionally
high
value
in
proportion
to
their
weight
and
bulk
nearly
all
her
capacity
indeed
will
be
filled
with
machinery
and
fuel
she
will
be
in
other
respects
more
like
a
floating
hotel
than
the
old
ideal
of
a
ship
her
cellars
so
to
speak
being
crammed
with
coal
and
her
upper
stories
fitted
luxuriously
for
sitting
and
bed
rooms
and
brilliant
with
the
electric
light
but
in
size
she
will
not
necessarily
be
any
larger
than
the
nineteenth
century
type
of
mail
steamer
indeed
the
probability
is
that
on
the
average
the
twentieth
century
will
be
smaller
being
built
for
speed
rather
than
for
magnificence
or
carrying
capacity
the
will
be
the
main
factor
in
working
the
approaching
revolution
in
mail
steamer
construction
the
special
reason
for
this
will
consist
in
the
fact
that
only
by
its
adoption
can
the
conditions
mentioned
above
be
fulfilled
with
the
ordinary
reciprocating
type
of
marine
steam
machinery
it
would
be
impossible
to
place
in
a
steamer
of
moderate
tonnage
engines
of
a
size
suitable
to
enable
it
to
attain
a
very
high
rate
of
speed
because
the
strain
and
vibration
of
the
gigantic
steel
arms
pulling
and
pushing
the
huge
cranks
to
turn
the
shafting
would
knock
the
hull
to
pieces
in
a
very
short
time
for
this
very
reason
in
fact
the
marine
architect
and
engineer
have
hitherto
urged
with
considerable
force
of
argument
that
high
speed
and
large
tonnage
must
go
concomitantly
practically
only
a
big
steamer
with
the
old
type
of
could
be
a
very
fast
one
and
for
ocean
traffic
at
any
rate
a
smaller
vessel
must
be
regarded
as
out
of
the
running
very
large
tonnage
being
thus
made
a
prime
necessity
it
followed
that
the
space
provided
must
be
utilised
and
this
need
has
tended
to
perpetuate
the
combination
of
mail
and
passenger
traffic
with
cargo
carrying
the
first
step
towards
the
revolution
was
taken
many
years
ago
when
the
screw
propeller
was
substituted
for
the
the
latter
means
of
propulsion
caused
shock
and
vibration
not
only
owing
to
the
thrusts
of
the
from
the
itself
but
also
from
the
impact
of
the
paddles
upon
the
water
one
after
the
other
a
great
increase
in
the
smoothness
of
running
was
attained
when
the
screw
was
invented
a
propeller
which
was
entirely
sunk
in
the
water
and
therefore
exercised
its
force
not
in
shocks
but
in
gentle
constant
pressure
upon
the
fluid
around
it
such
as
the
windmill
is
for
wind
and
the
turbine
for
water
was
the
screw
propeller
although
adapted
not
as
a
generator
but
as
an
application
of
power
having
made
the
work
and
stress
continuous
the
next
thing
to
be
accomplished
was
to
effect
a
similar
reform
in
the
engines
supplying
the
power
this
is
accomplished
in
the
turbine
by
causing
the
steam
to
play
in
strong
jets
continuously
and
steadily
upon
vanes
which
form
virtually
a
number
of
small
windmills
thus
while
the
screw
outside
of
the
hull
is
applying
the
force
continuously
the
steam
in
the
inside
is
driving
the
shafting
with
equal
evenness
and
regularity
the
steam
turbine
does
not
appear
to
have
by
any
means
reached
finality
in
its
form
such
questions
as
the
angle
of
impact
which
the
jet
should
make
with
the
surface
of
the
vane
and
the
size
of
the
orifice
through
which
the
steam
should
be
ejected
being
still
debatable
points
but
on
one
matter
there
is
hardly
any
room
for
doubt
and
that
is
that
the
best
way
to
secure
the
benefit
of
the
expansive
power
of
steam
is
to
permit
it
to
escape
from
a
pipe
having
a
long
series
of
orifices
and
to
impinge
upon
a
correspondingly
numerous
series
of
vanes
or
perhaps
upon
a
number
of
vanes
arranged
so
that
each
one
is
long
enough
to
receive
the
impact
of
many
jets
hitherto
the
steam
emitting
the
jet
has
been
placed
outside
of
the
circle
of
the
wheel
but
the
future
form
seems
likely
to
be
one
in
which
the
axis
of
the
wheel
is
itself
the
pipe
which
contains
the
steam
but
which
permits
it
to
escape
outwards
to
the
circumference
of
the
wheel
the
latter
is
in
this
form
of
turbine
made
in
the
shape
of
a
of
very
small
circumference
but
considerable
length
the
paddles
being
set
at
such
an
inclination
as
to
obtain
the
greatest
possible
rotative
impulse
from
the
steam
the
pipe
must
be
turned
true
at
intervals
to
enable
it
to
carry
a
number
of
diminutive
wheels
upon
which
these
long
vanes
are
mounted
and
a
very
strong
connection
must
be
made
between
these
wheels
and
the
shaft
of
the
screw
inasmuch
as
a
high
speed
of
rotation
is
to
be
maintained
the
pitch
of
the
screw
in
the
water
is
set
so
as
to
offer
but
slight
opposition
to
the
water
at
each
turn
the
immense
speed
attained
is
thus
due
not
to
the
actual
power
with
which
the
water
is
struck
by
the
screw
at
each
revolution
but
to
the
extraordinary
rapidity
with
which
the
shaft
rotates
the
twin
screw
with
which
the
best
and
safest
of
modern
are
all
fitted
will
soon
develop
into
what
may
be
called
the
twin
stern
each
screw
requires
a
separate
set
of
engines
and
the
main
object
of
the
duplication
is
to
lessen
the
risk
of
the
vessel
being
left
helpless
in
case
of
accident
to
one
or
other
the
advisability
of
placing
each
engine
and
shafting
in
a
separate
compartment
has
therefore
been
seen
at
this
point
there
presents
itself
for
consideration
the
advisability
of
separating
the
two
screws
by
as
wide
a
distance
as
may
be
convenient
and
placing
the
rudder
between
the
two
practically
therefore
it
will
be
found
best
to
build
out
a
steel
framework
from
each
side
of
the
stern
for
holding
the
bearings
of
each
screw
in
connection
with
the
twin
compartments
holding
the
shafting
and
thus
will
be
evolved
what
will
practically
represent
a
twin
or
double
stern
in
the
case
of
the
turbine
steamer
several
of
the
forms
of
screw
which
were
first
proposed
when
that
type
of
propeller
was
invented
will
again
come
up
for
examination
notably
the
archimedean
screw
wound
round
a
fairly
long
piece
of
shafting
the
larger
the
circular
area
of
this
screw
is
the
less
will
be
the
risk
of
smashing
the
water
or
of
losing
hold
of
it
entirely
in
rough
weather
with
twin
screws
of
the
large
archimedean
type
the
propelling
apparatus
of
a
turbine
steamer
will
if
the
screws
are
left
open
be
objected
to
on
the
ground
of
liability
to
foul
or
to
get
broken
in
crowded
fairways
hence
will
arise
a
demand
for
accommodation
for
each
screw
in
a
tube
forming
part
of
the
lower
hull
itself
and
open
at
the
side
for
the
taking
in
of
water
while
the
stern
part
is
equally
free
in
this
way
there
is
evolved
a
kind
of
compromise
between
the
two
principles
of
marine
propulsion
by
a
screw
and
by
a
jet
of
water
thrown
to
sternward
the
is
already
very
successfully
employed
for
the
propulsion
of
steam
lifeboats
in
which
owing
to
the
danger
of
fouling
the
and
other
tackle
an
open
screw
is
objectionable
the
final
extermination
of
the
sailing
ship
is
popularly
expected
as
one
of
the
first
developments
of
the
twentieth
century
in
maritime
traffic
steam
which
for
oversea
trade
made
its
entrance
cautiously
in
the
shape
of
a
mere
auxiliary
to
sail
power
had
taken
up
a
much
more
position
long
before
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
has
driven
its
former
ally
almost
out
of
the
field
in
large
departments
of
the
shipping
industry
yet
a
curious
and
interesting
counter
movement
is
now
taking
place
on
the
pacific
coast
of
america
as
well
as
among
the
south
sea
islands
and
in
several
other
places
where
coal
is
exceptionally
dear
trading
schooners
and
barques
used
in
these
localities
are
often
fitted
with
petroleum
oil
engines
which
enable
them
to
continue
their
voyages
during
calm
or
adverse
weather
for
the
owners
of
the
smaller
grade
of
craft
it
was
a
material
point
in
recommendation
of
this
movement
that
having
no
boiler
or
other
parts
liable
to
explode
and
wreck
the
vessel
an
oil
engine
may
be
worked
without
the
attendance
of
a
certificated
engineer
as
soon
as
this
legal
question
was
settled
a
considerable
impetus
was
given
to
the
extension
of
the
auxiliary
principle
for
sailing
ships
the
shorter
duration
of
the
average
voyage
made
by
the
power
vessels
had
the
effect
of
enabling
shippers
to
realise
upon
the
goods
carried
more
speedily
than
would
have
been
possible
under
the
old
system
of
alone
it
is
already
found
that
in
the
matter
of
economy
of
working
including
interest
on
cost
of
vessel
and
cargo
these
ships
can
well
hold
their
own
against
the
ordinary
steam
cargo
slave
up
to
a
certain
point
the
policy
of
relying
upon
steam
entirely
unaided
by
any
natural
cheap
source
of
power
has
been
successful
but
the
rate
of
speed
which
the
best
types
of
marine
engines
impart
to
this
kind
of
vessel
is
strictly
limited
owing
to
considerations
of
the
enormous
increase
of
after
passing
the
twelve
or
fourteen
mile
grade
for
ocean
greyhounds
carrying
mails
and
passengers
the
prime
necessity
of
high
speed
has
to
a
large
extent
obliterated
any
such
separating
line
between
waste
and
economy
it
is
however
a
mistake
to
imagine
that
the
cargo
steamer
of
the
future
will
be
in
any
sense
a
replica
of
the
of
the
opposition
presented
by
the
water
to
the
passage
of
a
vessel
increases
by
leaps
and
bounds
as
soon
as
the
rate
now
adopted
by
the
cargo
steamer
is
passed
and
thus
presents
a
natural
barrier
beyond
which
it
will
not
be
economically
feasible
to
advance
much
further
if
then
we
recognise
clearly
that
steam
cargo
transport
across
the
ocean
can
only
be
done
remuneratively
at
about
one
half
the
speed
now
attained
by
the
very
fastest
we
shall
soon
perceive
also
that
the
chances
of
the
auxiliary
principle
if
wisely
introduced
placing
the
sailer
on
a
level
with
the
cargo
ship
worked
by
steam
alone
are
by
no
means
hopeless
a
type
of
vessel
which
can
be
trusted
to
make
some
ten
or
twelve
knots
regularly
and
which
can
also
take
advantage
of
the
power
of
the
wind
whenever
it
is
in
its
favour
must
inevitably
possess
a
material
advantage
over
the
steam
cargo
slave
in
economy
of
working
while
making
almost
the
same
average
passages
as
its
rival
then
also
the
sailless
cargo
slave
in
the
keen
competition
that
must
arise
will
be
fitted
with
such
appliances
as
human
ingenuity
can
in
future
devise
or
has
already
tentatively
suggested
for
invoking
the
aid
of
natural
powers
in
order
to
supplement
the
and
effect
a
saving
in
fuel
one
of
these
will
no
doubt
be
the
adoption
of
the
heavy
pendulum
with
universal
joint
movement
in
a
special
hold
of
the
vessel
so
connected
with
an
plant
that
its
movements
may
continually
work
to
fill
a
reservoir
of
air
at
a
high
pressure
the
marine
engines
of
the
ordinary
type
will
then
be
adapted
to
work
with
compressed
air
and
the
true
itself
will
be
used
for
operating
an
air
compressor
on
the
system
adopted
in
mines
the
pendulum
apparatus
of
course
is
really
a
device
for
enabling
a
vessel
to
derive
from
the
power
of
the
waves
which
raise
her
and
roll
her
an
impetus
in
the
desired
direction
of
her
course
inventions
of
this
description
will
at
first
be
only
very
cautiously
and
partially
adopted
because
if
there
is
one
thing
which
the
master
mariner
fears
more
than
another
it
is
any
heavy
moving
weight
in
the
hold
the
motions
of
which
during
a
storm
might
possibly
become
uncontrollable
when
steam
was
first
applied
to
the
propulsion
of
ships
the
common
argument
against
it
was
that
any
machine
worked
by
steam
and
having
sufficient
power
to
propel
a
vessel
would
also
develop
so
much
vibration
as
to
pull
her
to
pieces
to
say
nothing
of
the
risk
of
having
her
hull
shattered
at
one
fell
blow
by
the
explosion
of
the
steam
boiler
these
undoubtedly
are
dangers
which
have
to
be
provided
against
and
probably
the
occasional
lack
of
care
has
been
the
cause
of
many
an
unreported
loss
as
well
as
of
recorded
mishaps
from
broken
and
screws
or
from
explosions
far
out
at
sea
the
pendulum
will
no
doubt
be
constructed
on
such
a
principle
that
whenever
there
is
any
danger
of
its
weighty
movements
getting
beyond
control
or
doing
any
damage
to
the
vessel
its
force
can
be
instantly
removed
at
will
and
the
apparatus
can
be
brought
to
a
standstill
by
the
application
of
friction
brakes
and
other
means
the
weight
may
be
made
up
of
comparatively
small
pigs
of
iron
which
through
the
opening
of
a
valve
controlled
from
the
deck
by
the
stem
of
the
pendulum
can
be
let
fall
out
into
the
hold
separately
the
swinging
framework
would
then
be
steadied
by
the
friction
brake
gripping
it
gradually
auxiliary
machinery
of
this
class
can
only
be
made
use
of
as
already
indicated
to
a
certain
strictly
limited
extent
owing
to
the
tendency
of
any
swinging
weight
in
a
vessel
to
aggravate
the
rolling
during
heavy
weather
some
tentative
schemes
have
been
put
forward
for
tapping
a
source
of
by
providing
a
vessel
with
flippers
resting
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
outside
her
hull
and
actuating
suitable
internal
machinery
with
the
object
of
propulsion
a
certain
amount
of
encouragement
has
been
given
by
the
performances
of
small
craft
fitted
in
this
way
but
it
is
objected
by
men
that
the
behaviour
of
a
large
vessel
encumbered
with
outlying
parts
moving
on
the
waves
independently
would
probably
be
very
erratic
during
a
storm
and
would
endanger
the
safety
of
the
ship
itself
no
kind
of
floating
appendage
moving
independently
of
the
vessel
could
exercise
any
actual
force
by
the
uprising
of
a
wave
in
lifting
it
without
being
to
some
extent
sunk
in
the
water
and
accordingly
when
the
waves
were
running
high
there
would
be
imminent
risk
that
heavy
volumes
of
water
would
get
upon
the
apparatus
and
prevent
the
ship
from
righting
itself
many
of
the
schemes
that
have
been
put
forward
by
patent
and
otherwise
for
the
automatic
propulsion
of
ships
have
entirely
failed
to
commend
themselves
by
reason
of
their
taking
little
or
no
account
of
the
behaviour
of
a
ship
fitted
with
the
proposed
inventions
during
very
rough
and
trying
weather
the
swinging
pendulum
with
connected
apparatus
for
compressing
air
or
perhaps
for
generating
the
electric
current
seems
to
be
the
most
controllable
and
therefore
the
safest
of
the
various
types
of
apparatus
which
are
applicable
to
the
utilisation
of
for
propulsion
in
the
construction
of
connecting
machinery
by
which
the
movements
of
a
pendulum
hanging
up
from
a
universal
joint
may
be
transmitted
to
wheels
or
pistons
operating
compressors
or
dynamos
it
is
necessary
to
transform
all
motions
passing
in
any
direction
through
the
spherical
or
figure
traced
out
by
the
end
of
the
pendulum
in
the
course
of
its
swinging
this
may
be
effected
for
instance
in
the
case
of
a
pendulum
working
by
mounting
the
latter
on
bearings
like
those
of
the
in
a
field
piece
and
having
two
of
them
operating
one
at
right
angles
to
the
other
the
rods
which
carry
the
pistons
are
then
connected
to
the
end
of
the
pendulum
by
universal
joints
and
the
parts
which
have
been
likened
to
a
are
fixed
on
pivots
so
as
to
be
able
to
move
horizontally
joints
in
the
pipes
which
lead
to
the
compressed
air
reservoir
are
placed
in
the
bearings
of
this
mounting
we
thus
have
the
same
kind
of
provision
for
taking
advantage
of
a
universal
movement
in
space
as
is
made
in
solid
geometry
by
three
at
right
angles
to
one
another
for
measuring
such
movements
another
plan
is
to
have
the
pendulum
swung
in
a
strong
steel
collar
and
carrying
at
its
end
three
or
more
pumps
set
radially
with
the
thrust
outwards
by
a
strong
spring
on
each
but
with
the
ends
perfectly
free
from
any
attachment
yet
fitted
with
a
buffer
or
wheel
as
the
pendulum
moves
it
throws
one
or
more
of
these
ends
into
contact
with
the
inner
surface
of
the
ring
driving
it
into
the
compressing
pump
at
the
top
of
the
pendulum
there
is
a
double
or
universal
through
which
the
air
under
pressure
is
driven
to
the
reservoir
and
by
which
the
apparatus
is
also
hung
this
is
the
simplest
and
in
some
respects
the
best
form
a
very
simple
type
of
the
motor
as
applied
to
marine
propulsion
is
based
upon
an
idea
taken
from
the
mode
of
progression
adopted
by
certain
crustaceans
namely
the
possession
of
the
means
for
drawing
in
and
rapidly
ejecting
the
water
something
of
the
kind
will
most
probably
be
made
available
for
assisting
in
the
propulsion
of
sailing
ships
which
are
not
furnished
with
machinery
of
any
type
suitable
for
the
driving
of
a
screw
a
very
much
simplified
form
of
the
pendulous
or
rocking
weight
is
applicable
in
this
case
a
considerable
amount
of
cargo
is
stowed
away
in
an
inner
hull
taking
the
shape
of
what
is
practically
a
gigantic
cradle
rocking
upon
semicircular
lines
of
railway
iron
laid
down
in
the
form
of
ribs
of
the
ship
to
the
sides
of
these
large
rocking
receptacles
are
connected
the
rods
carrying
at
their
other
ends
the
pistons
of
large
which
draw
the
water
in
at
one
stroke
and
force
it
out
to
sternwards
below
the
water
line
at
the
other
in
this
arrangement
it
is
obvious
that
only
the
roll
and
not
the
pitch
of
the
vessel
can
be
utilised
as
the
medium
through
which
to
obtain
propulsive
force
but
it
is
probable
that
fully
eighty
per
cent
of
the
movements
of
a
vessel
during
a
long
voyage
as
indicated
say
by
the
direction
and
sweep
of
its
consists
of
the
roll
each
ton
of
goods
moved
through
a
vertical
distance
of
one
foot
in
relation
to
the
hull
of
the
vessel
has
in
it
the
potentiality
of
developing
when
fourteen
or
fifteen
movements
occur
per
minute
about
one
a
cradle
containing
tons
as
may
therefore
be
imagined
can
be
made
to
afford
very
material
assistance
in
helping
forward
a
sailing
ship
during
a
calm
in
such
tantalising
weather
the
of
the
ocean
usually
carries
past
a
becalmed
vessel
more
waste
energy
than
is
ever
utilised
by
its
sails
in
the
briskest
and
most
propitious
breeze
for
sailing
ships
especially
the
rocking
form
of
as
an
aid
to
propulsion
will
be
recommended
on
account
of
the
fact
that
when
the
weather
is
on
the
beam
both
of
its
sources
of
power
can
be
kept
in
full
use
the
sailing
vessel
must
tack
at
any
rate
with
the
object
of
giving
its
sail
power
a
fair
chance
and
thus
when
it
has
not
a
fair
wind
that
follows
free
it
must
always
seek
to
get
the
breeze
on
its
beam
and
therefore
usually
the
swell
must
be
taking
it
sideways
it
would
be
only
on
rare
occasions
that
a
sailing
vessel
if
furnished
with
rocking
gear
for
using
the
would
be
set
to
go
nearer
to
the
teeth
of
the
wind
than
she
would
under
present
conditions
of
using
alone
the
advantage
of
the
however
would
be
seen
mainly
during
the
calm
and
desultory
weather
which
has
virtually
been
the
means
of
forcing
to
resign
its
supremacy
to
steam
for
checking
the
rocker
in
time
of
heavy
weather
special
appliances
are
necessary
which
of
course
must
be
easily
operated
from
the
deck
pieces
with
rails
attached
may
be
driven
down
by
screws
upon
the
sides
of
the
vessel
thus
having
the
effect
of
gradually
narrowing
the
amplitude
of
the
rocking
motion
until
a
condition
of
stability
with
reference
to
the
hull
has
been
attained
in
the
building
of
steel
ships
as
well
as
in
the
construction
of
bridges
and
other
erections
demanding
much
great
economies
will
be
introduced
by
the
reduction
of
the
extent
to
which
riveting
will
be
required
when
the
full
advantages
of
hydraulic
pressure
are
realised
the
plates
used
in
the
building
of
a
ship
will
be
at
one
side
and
split
at
the
other
with
the
object
of
making
joints
without
the
need
for
using
rivets
to
anything
like
the
extent
at
present
required
in
putting
the
plates
thus
treated
together
to
form
the
hull
of
a
vessel
the
swollen
side
of
one
plate
is
inserted
between
the
split
portions
of
another
and
the
latter
parts
are
then
clamped
down
by
heavy
hydraulic
pressure
this
important
principle
is
already
successfully
used
in
the
making
of
rivetless
pipes
and
its
application
to
ships
and
bridges
will
be
only
a
matter
of
a
comparatively
short
time
through
this
reform
and
the
further
use
of
steel
ribs
for
imparting
strength
and
thus
admitting
of
the
employment
of
thinner
steel
plates
for
the
actual
shell
the
cost
of
shipbuilding
will
be
very
greatly
reduced
hoisting
and
unloading
machines
will
play
a
notable
part
in
minimising
the
expenses
of
handling
goods
carried
by
sea
the
system
is
only
the
beginning
of
a
revolution
in
this
department
which
will
not
end
until
the
loading
and
unloading
of
ships
have
become
almost
entirely
the
work
of
machinery
the
principle
of
the
tool
known
as
the
may
prove
itself
very
useful
in
this
connection
from
a
heap
of
tailings
the
miner
can
select
a
sample
by
boring
into
it
with
a
thin
tube
inside
of
which
revolves
a
shaft
carrying
at
its
end
a
flat
steel
rotary
scoop
the
auger
after
working
its
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
heap
is
raised
and
of
course
it
contains
a
fair
sample
of
the
sand
at
all
depths
from
the
top
downwards
on
a
somewhat
similar
principle
the
unloading
of
ships
laden
with
grain
ore
coal
and
all
other
articles
which
can
be
handled
in
bulk
and
divided
will
be
carried
out
by
machines
which
by
rotary
action
will
work
their
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
hull
and
will
then
be
elevated
by
powerful
lifting
cranes
for
other
classes
of
goods
permanent
packages
and
tramways
will
be
provided
in
each
ship
and
trucks
will
be
supplied
at
the
wharf
for
coastal
passages
across
shallow
but
rough
water
like
the
english
channel
the
services
of
moving
bridges
will
be
called
into
requisition
one
of
these
has
been
at
work
at
malo
on
the
french
coast
opposite
jersey
and
another
was
more
recently
constructed
on
the
english
coast
near
brighton
for
the
longer
and
much
more
important
service
across
the
channel
submarine
rails
may
be
laid
down
as
in
the
cases
mentioned
but
in
addition
it
will
be
necessary
to
provide
for
static
stability
by
fixing
a
pontoon
just
below
the
greatest
depth
of
wave
disturbance
and
just
sufficient
in
buoyancy
to
take
the
great
bulk
of
the
weight
of
the
structure
off
the
rails
in
this
way
passengers
may
be
conveyed
across
straits
like
the
channel
without
the
discomforts
of
the
stoking
difficulties
on
large
steamers
have
become
so
acute
that
they
now
suggest
the
conclusion
that
notwithstanding
repeated
failures
a
really
effective
mechanical
stoker
will
be
so
imperatively
called
for
as
to
enforce
the
adoption
of
any
reasonably
good
device
the
heat
grime
and
general
misery
of
the
have
become
so
deterrent
that
the
difficulty
of
securing
men
to
undertake
the
work
grows
greater
year
by
year
and
in
recruiting
the
ranks
of
the
stokers
resort
had
to
be
had
more
and
more
to
those
unfortunate
men
whose
principal
motive
for
labour
is
the
insatiable
desire
for
a
drinking
bout
on
the
occasions
of
several
shipwrecks
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
disquieting
revelations
took
place
showing
how
savagely
bitter
was
the
feeling
of
the
towards
the
first
saloon
as
soon
as
the
mechanical
has
been
adopted
and
the
boilers
have
been
properly
insulated
in
order
to
prevent
the
overheating
of
the
the
stoker
will
be
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
secondary
engineer
and
his
work
will
cease
to
be
looked
upon
as
in
any
sense
degrading
on
the
steamer
and
sailer
a
similar
social
revolution
will
be
brought
about
by
the
amelioration
of
the
conditions
under
which
the
men
live
and
work
already
some
owners
and
masters
have
begun
to
mitigate
to
a
certain
extent
the
embargo
which
the
choice
of
a
life
has
in
times
past
been
understood
to
place
upon
married
men
positions
are
found
for
women
as
stewardesses
and
in
other
capacities
and
it
is
coming
to
be
increasingly
recognised
that
there
is
a
large
amount
of
women
work
to
be
done
on
board
a
ship
by
and
by
when
it
is
found
that
the
best
and
steadiest
men
can
be
secured
by
making
some
little
concessions
to
their
desire
for
a
settled
life
and
their
objections
to
the
crimp
and
the
girl
at
every
port
and
all
the
other
squalid
accessories
so
generally
attached
in
the
popular
mind
to
the
seaman
career
there
will
be
a
serious
effort
on
the
part
of
owners
to
remodel
the
community
on
board
of
a
ship
on
the
lines
of
a
village
there
will
be
the
ship
shop
and
the
ship
school
the
ship
church
and
various
other
institutions
and
societies
thus
in
the
twentieth
century
the
sea
will
no
longer
be
regarded
to
the
same
extent
as
in
the
past
as
the
refuge
for
the
of
the
populace
and
this
more
than
perhaps
anything
else
will
help
to
render
travelling
by
the
great
ocean
highways
safe
and
comfortable
it
is
a
common
complaint
on
the
part
of
owners
that
by
far
the
larger
part
of
maritime
disasters
are
directly
traceable
to
misconduct
or
neglect
of
duty
on
the
part
of
masters
officers
or
crew
but
they
have
the
remedy
in
their
own
hands
chapter

agriculture
muscular
power
still
carries
out
all
the
most
laborious
work
of
the
farm
and
of
the
garden
work
which
of
course
consists
in
the
main
of
turning
the
land
over
and
breaking
up
the
sods
in
the
operations
of
ploughing
harrowing
rolling
and
so
forth
the
agency
almost
exclusively
employed
is
the
muscular
power
of
the
horse
guided
by
with
the
accompaniment
of
a
very
large
and
exhausting
expenditure
of
muscular
effort
on
the
part
of
the
farmer
or
farm
labourer
on
the
fruit
and
vegetable
garden
the
great
preponderance
of
the
power
usefully
exercised
must
under
existing
conditions
come
direct
from
the
muscles
of
men
spade
and
plough
represent
the
badges
of
the
rural
workers
servitude
and
to
rescue
the
country
residents
from
this
bondage
must
be
one
of
the
chief
objects
to
which
invention
will
in
the
near
future
apply
itself
the
miner
has
to
a
very
large
extent
escaped
from
the
thraldom
of
mere
or
hardening
muscular
effort
he
drills
the
holes
in
the
face
of
the
rock
at
which
he
is
working
by
means
of
compressed
air
or
power
conveyed
by
the
electric
current
and
then
he
performs
the
work
of
breaking
it
down
by
the
agency
of
dynamite
or
some
other
high
explosive
much
heavy
bodily
labour
no
doubt
remains
to
be
done
by
some
classes
of
workers
in
mines
but
the
significance
of
the
march
of
improvement
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
a
larger
and
larger
proportion
of
those
who
work
under
the
surface
of
the
ground
or
in
works
consists
of
men
who
are
gradually
being
enrolled
among
the
ranks
of
the
more
highly
skilled
and
intelligent
workers
whose
duty
it
is
to
understand
and
to
superintend
pieces
of
mechanism
driven
by
mechanical
power
in
farming
and
horticulture
the
field
of
labour
is
not
so
narrowly
localised
as
it
is
in
mining
work
representing
an
expenditure
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
may
be
carried
out
in
mines
whose
area
does
not
exceed
two
or
three
acres
and
it
is
therefore
highly
renumerative
to
concentrate
mechanical
power
upon
such
enterprises
in
the
most
machinery
but
the
farmer
ranges
from
side
to
side
of
his
wide
fields
covering
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
acres
with
his
operations
he
is
better
situated
than
the
miner
in
respect
of
the
economical
and
healthy
application
of
but
far
worse
in
regard
to
the
immediate
possibilities
of
and
energy
no
one
can
feed
draught
stock
more
cheaply
than
he
and
no
one
can
secure
men
to
work
from
sunrise
till
evening
at
a
lower
wage
yet
the
course
of
industrial
evolution
which
has
made
so
much
progress
in
the
mine
and
the
factory
must
very
soon
powerfully
affect
agriculture
already
in
farming
districts
contiguous
to
unlimited
supplies
of
cheap
power
from
waterfalls
schemes
have
been
set
on
foot
for
the
supply
of
power
on
principles
to
the
farmers
of
fertile
land
in
america
germany
france
and
great
britain
one
necessity
which
will
most
materially
aid
in
spurring
forward
the
movement
for
the
distribution
of
power
for
rural
work
is
the
requirement
of
special
means
for
lifting
water
for
irrigation
more
particularly
in
those
places
where
good
land
lies
very
close
to
the
area
that
is
naturally
irrigable
by
some
scheme
already
in
operation
but
just
a
little
too
high
here
it
is
seen
at
once
that
power
means
fertility
and
consequent
wealth
while
the
lack
of
it
if
the
climate
be
really
dry
as
in
the
pacific
states
of
america
means
loss
and
dearth
but
the
presence
of
a
source
of
power
which
can
easily
be
shifted
about
from
place
to
place
on
the
farm
for
the
purpose
of
watering
the
ground
must
very
soon
suggest
the
applicability
of
the
same
mechanical
energy
to
the
digging
or
ploughing
of
the
soil
it
is
from
this
direction
rather
than
from
the
wide
introduction
of
and
diggers
that
the
first
great
impetus
to
the
employment
of
mechanical
power
on
the
farm
may
be
looked
for
the
no
doubt
has
before
it
a
future
full
of
usefulness
and
yet
the
slow
progress
that
has
been
made
by
it
during
a
quarter
of
a
century
suggests
that
in
its
present
form
that
is
to
say
while
built
on
lines
imitating
the
locomotive
and
the
it
can
not
very
successfully
challenge
the
plough
drawn
by
more
probable
is
it
as
has
already
been
indicated
that
the
analogy
of
the
in
mining
work
will
be
followed
the
farmer
will
use
an
implement
much
smaller
and
handier
than
a
movable
but
supplied
with
power
from
a
central
station
either
on
his
own
land
or
in
some
place
maintained
by
or
public
agency
just
as
the
miner
pounds
away
at
the
rock
by
means
of
compressed
air
or
electricity
brought
to
his
hands
through
a
pipe
or
a
wire
so
the
farmer
will
work
his
land
by
spades
or
ploughs
by
the
same
kind
of
mechanical
power
the
advantages
of
electrical
transmission
of
energy
will
greatly
favour
this
kind
of
installation
on
the
farm
as
compared
with
any
other
method
of
distribution
which
is
as
yet
in
sight
for
the
ploughing
of
a
field
by
the
electric
plough
a
cable
will
be
required
capable
of
being
stretched
along
one
side
of
the
area
to
be
worked
on
this
will
run
loosely
a
link
or
wheel
connected
with
another
wire
wound
upon
a
drum
carried
on
the
plough
and
paid
out
as
the
latter
proceeds
across
the
field
for
different
grades
of
land
of
course
different
modes
of
working
are
advisable
the
ordinary
plough
of
a
multifurrow
pattern
with
springs
or
weights
being
used
for
land
which
is
not
too
heavy
or
clayey
a
disc
plough
or
harrow
being
applicable
to
light
ground
and
the
mechanical
spade
or
reciprocating
in
its
motion
very
much
like
the
having
its
special
sphere
of
usefulness
in
wet
and
heavy
land
in
any
case
a
wide
gripping
wheel
is
required
in
front
to
carry
the
machine
forward
and
to
turn
it
on
reaching
the
end
of
the
furrow
the
drum
is
actuated
by
a
spring
which
tends
to
keep
it
constantly
wound
up
and
when
the
plough
has
turned
and
is
heading
again
towards
the
cable
at
the
side
of
the
field
this
drum
automatically
winds
up
the
wire
so
also
when
each
pair
of
furrows
has
been
completed
the
is
automatically
shifted
along
upon
the
fixed
cable
to
a
position
suitable
for
the
next
pair
not
only
in
the
working
but
also
in
the
manuring
of
the
soil
the
electric
current
will
play
an
important
part
in
the
revolution
in
agriculture
the
fixing
of
the
nitrogen
from
the
atmosphere
in
order
to
form
nitrates
available
as
manure
depends
from
the
physical
point
of
view
upon
the
creation
of
a
sufficient
heat
to
set
fire
to
it
the
economic
bearings
of
this
fact
upon
the
future
of
agriculture
especially
in
its
relation
to
seemed
so
important
to
sir
william
crookes
that
he
made
the
subject
the
principal
topic
of
his
presidential
address
before
the
british
association
in
the
feasibility
of
the
electrical
mode
of
fixing
atmospheric
nitrogen
for

been
demonstrated
by
eminent
electricians
the
famous
hungarian
inventor
nikola
tesla
being
among
the
foremost
the
electric
furnace
is
just
as
readily
applicable
for
forcing
the
combination
of
an
intractable
element
such
as
nitrogen
with
other
materials
suitable
for
forming
a
manurial
base
as
it
is
for
making
calcium
carbide
by
bringing
about
the
union
of
two
such
unsociable
constituents
as
lime
and
carbon
cheap
power
is
in
this
view
the
great
essential
for
economically
enriching
the
soil
as
well
as
for
turning
it
over
and
preparing
it
for
the
reception
of
seed
nor
is
the
fact
a
matter
of
slight
importance
that
this
power
is
specially
demanded
for
the
production
of
an
electric
current
for
heating
purposes
because
the
transmission
of
such
a
current
over
long
distances
to
the
places
at
which
the
manurial
product
is
required
will
save
the
cost
of
much
transport
of
heavy
material
the
agricultural
chemist
and
the
microbiologist
of
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
laid
considerable
stress
upon
the
prospects
of
using
the
minute
organisms
which
attach
themselves
to
the
roots
of
some
plants
particularly
those
of
the
leguminaceæ
as
the
means
of
fixing
the
nitrogen
of
the
atmosphere
and
rendering
it
available
for
the
of
cereals
which
are
not
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
encouraging
those
bacteria
which
fix
nitrogen
high
hopes
have
been
based
upon
the
prospects
of
inoculating
the
soil
over
wide
areas
of
land
with
small
quantities
of
sandy
loam
taken
from
patches
cultivated
for
leguminous
plants
which
have
been
permitted
to
run
to
seed
thus
multiplying
the
bacteria
enormously
the
main
idea
has
been
to
encourage
the
rapid
production
of
these
minute
organisms
in
places
where
they
may
be
specially
useful
but
in
which
they
do
not
find
a
particularly
congenial
breeding
ground
the
hope
that
any
striking
revolution
may
be
brought
about
in
the
practice
of
agriculture
by
a
device
of
this
kind
must
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
while
the
scientists
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
demonstrated
partially
at
least
the
true
reason
for
the
beneficial
effects
of
growing
leguminous
plants
upon
soil
intended
to
be
afterwards
laid
down
in
cereals
they
were
not
by
any
means
the
first
to
observe
the
fact
that
such
benefits
accrued
from
the
practice
indicated
several
references
in
the
writings
of
ancient
greek
and
latin
poets
prove
definitely
that
the
good
results
of
a
rotation
of
crops
regulated
by
the
introduction
of
leguminous
plants
at
certain
stages
were
empirically
understood
in
that
more
primitive
process
of
reasoning
which
proceeds
upon
the
assumption
hoc
ergo
propter
the
ancient
agriculturist
was
a
and
the
chance
of
gleaning
something
valuable
from
the
field
of
common
observation
over
which
he
has
trod
is
not
very
great
modern
improvements
in
agriculture
will
probably
be
in
the
main
such
as
are
based
upon
fundamental
processes
unknown
to
the
ancients
by
the
word
processes
it
is
intended
to
indicate
not
those
methods
the
scientific
reasons
for
which
were
understood
for
these
in
ancient
times
were
very
few
but
simply
those
which
from
long
experience
were
noticed
to
be
beneficial
good
husbandry
was
in
olden
times
clearly
understood
to
include
the
practice
of
the
rotation
of
crops
and
the
beneficial
results
to
be
expected
from
the
introduction
of
those
crops
which
are
now
discovered
to
act
as
hosts
to
the
microbes
which
fix
atmospheric
nitrogen
were
not
only
observed
but
insisted
upon
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
this
concurrence
of
the
results
of
ancient
and
of
modern
observation
may
only
serve
to
render
the
bacteriology
of
the
soil
more
interesting
but
from
the
standpoint
of
an
estimate
of
the
practical
openings
for
agriculture
improvements
in
the
near
future
it
greatly
dwarfs
the
prospect
of
any
change
actually
founded
upon
the
principle
of
the
rotation
of
crops
it
is
indeed
conceivable
that
fresh
light
on
the
life
habits
of
the
minute
organisms
of
the
soil
may
lead
to
practical
results
quite
new
but
hardly
any
such
light
is
yet
within
the
inventor
field
of
vision
this
view
of
the
limited
prospects
of
practical
microbiology
for
the
fixing
of
nitrogen
in
was
corroborated
by
sir
william
crookes
in
the
presidential
address
already
cited
he
said
that
practice
has
for
a
very
long
time
been
ahead
of
science
in
respect
of
this
department
of
husbandry
for
ages
what
is
known
as
the
four
course
rotation
had
been
practised
the
crops
following
one
another
in
this
order
turnips
barley
clover
and
wheat
a
sequence
which
was
popular
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
his
summing
up
of
the
position
was
to
the
effect
that
our
present
knowledge
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
much
more
frequent
growth
of
clover
on
the
same
land
even
with
successful
and
proper
mineral
supplies
would
be
attended
with
uncertainties
and
difficulties
because
the
land
soon
becomes
what
is
called
and
turns
barren
in
regard
to
any
practical
application
of
the
farmers
of
the
united
kingdom
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
had
not
in
the
opinion
of
this
eminent
chemist
reached
even
the
experimental
stage
although
on
the
continent
there
had
been
some
extension
of
microbe
cultivation
to
this
it
may
fairly
be
added
that
some
of
the
attention
attracted
to
the
subject
on
the
continent
has
been
due
to
the
natural
tendency
of
the
german
mind
to
discover
fine
differences
between
things
which
are
not
radically
distinct
under
the
title
of
the
practice
of
the
rotation
of
crops
may
to
some
continental
enthusiasts
seem
to
be
quite
an
innovation
in
the
electrical
the
operations
will
be
simply
an
enlargement
of
laboratory
experiments
which
have
been
familiar
to
the
chemist
for
many
years
moist
air
kept
damp
by
steam
is
traversed
by
strong
electric
sparks
from
an
induction
coil
inside
of
a
bottle
or
other
receiver
and
in
a
short
time
it
is
found
that
in
the
bottom
of
this
receptacle
a
liquid
has
accumulated
which
on
being
tested
proves
to
be
nitric
acid
there
is
also
present
a
small
quantity
of
ammonia
from
the
atmosphere
nitrate
of
ammonia
thus
formed
would
in
itself
be
a
manure
but
of
course
on
the
large
scale
other
nitrates
will
be
formed
by
mixing
the
acid
with
cheap
alkalies
which
are
abundant
in
nature
soda
from
common
salt
and
lime
from
limestone
in
this
process
the
excessive
heat
of
the
electric
discharge
really
raises
the
nitrogen
and
oxygen
of
the
atmosphere
to
a
point
of
temperature
at
which
chemical
union
is
forced
or
in
other
words
the
nitrogen
is
compelled
to
burn
and
to
join
in
chemical
combination
with
the
oxygen
with
which
formerly
it
was
only
in
mechanical
mixture
when
nitrogen
is
burning
its
flame
is
not
in
itself
hot
enough
to
ignite
contiguous
volumes
of
the
same
element
otherwise
indeed
our
atmosphere
after
a
discharge
of
lightning
would
burn
itself
out
but
the
continuance
of
an
electric
discharge
forces
into
combination
just
a
proportionate
quantity
of
nitrogen
practically
therefore
manure
in
the
future
will
mean
electricity
and
therefore
power
so
that
cheap
sources
of
energy
are
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
farmer
with
dynamos
driven
by
the
price
of
nitrate
of
soda
would
according
to
the
estimate
of
sir
william
crookes
be
per
ton
but
at
niagara
where
water
power
is
very
cheap
not
more
than
per
ton
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
cheapness
of
power
due
to
the
presence
of
the
waterfall
makes
such
a
difference
in
the
economic
aspects
of
the
problem
of
the
electrical
manufacture
of
manurial
nitrates
as
to
reduce
the
price
to
less
than
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
electric
installation
at
niagara
is
by
very
many
persons
looked
upon
as
being
in
itself
in
the
nature
of
an
experiment
but
at
any
rate
there
seems
to
be
no
room
for
doubt
that
the
cost
of
natural
power
for
electrical
installations
will
very
soon
be
materially
reduced
even
at
the
price
quoted
namely
per
ton
the
cost
of
nitrate
of
soda
made
with
electrically
combined
atmospheric
nitrogen
compares
very
favourably
with
commercial
nitrates
as
now
imported
for
agriculture
purposes
chili
nitrate
in
fact
is
about
fifty
per
cent
dearer
when
and
other
forms
of
the
stored
energy
of
the
wind
have
been
properly
harnessed
in
the
service
of
mankind
the
region
around
niagara
will
only
be
one
of
thousands
of
localities
at
which
nitrogenous
manures
can
be
manufactured
electrically
at
a
price
far
below
the
present
cost
of
natural
deposits
of
nitrate
of
soda
from
the
power
stations
all
around
the
coasts
as
well
as
from
those
on
waterfalls
and
windy
heights
among
the
mountains
electric
cables
will
be
employed
to
convey
the
current
for
fixing
the
nitrogen
of
the
air
at
places
where
the
manures
are
most
wanted
the
rediscovery
of
the
art
of
irrigation
is
one
of
the
distinguishing
features
of
modern
industrial
progress
in
agriculture
extensive
ruins
and
other
remains
in
assyria
egypt
india
china
and
central
america
prove
beyond
question
that
irrigation
played
a
vastly
more
important
part
in
the
industrial
life
of
the
ancients
than
it
does
in
that
of
modern
mankind
this
is
true
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
power
and
dominion
ultimately
fell
to
the
lot
of
those
races
which
originally
dwelt
in
colder
and
more
hilly
or
regions
where
the
instincts
of
hunting
and
of
warfare
were
naturally
developed
so
that
by
degrees
the
peoples
who
understood
irrigation
fell
under
the
sway
of
those
who
neither
needed
nor
appreciated
it
in
the
long
interval
vast
forests
have
been
cleared
away
and
the
warlike
habits
of
the
northern
and
mountainous
races
have
been
greatly
modified
but
manufacturing
progress
among
them
has
enabled
them
to
perpetuate
the
power
originally
secured
by
the
bow
and
the
spear
the
irrigating
races
of
mankind
are
now
held
in
fear
of
the
modern
weapons
which
are
the
products
of
the
iron
and
steel
industries
just
as
they
were
thousands
of
years
ago
terrorised
by
the
inroads
of
the
wild
hunting
men
from
the
north
but
the
future
of
agriculture
will
very
largely
belong
to
a
class
of
men
who
will
combine
in
themselves
the
best
attributes
of
the
irrigationist
and
the
man
who
knows
how
to
use
the
iron
weapon
and
the
iron
implement
as
the
manufacturing
supremacy
of
the
north
becomes
more
and
more
assured
by
reason
of
the
superior
healthiness
of
a
climate
encouraging
activity
of
muscle
and
brain
so
the
agricultural
prospects
of
the
warmer
regions
of
the
earth
surface
will
be
improved
by
the
comparative
immunity
of
plant
and
of
animal
life
from
disease
in
a
dry
atmosphere
sheep
cattle
and
horses
thrive
far
better
in
a
climate
having
but
a
scanty
rainfall
than
in
one
having
an
abundance
of
wet
and
so
also
does
the
wheat
plant
when
the
limited
rains
happen
to
be
timed
to
suit
its
growth
and
the
best
kinds
of
fruit
trees
when
the
same
conditions
prevail
all
this
points
to
an
immense
recrudescence
of
irrigation
in
the
near
future
already
the
californians
and
other
americans
of
the
pacific
slope
have
demonstrated
that
irrigation
is
a
practice
fully
as
well
suited
to
the
requirements
of
a
thoroughly
people
as
it
has
been
for
long
ages
to
those
of
the
unchanging
east
but
here
again
the
question
of
cheap
power
obtrudes
itself
the
chinese
hindoos
and
egyptians
have
long
ago
passed
the
stage
at
which
the
limited
areas
which
were
irrigable
by
gravitation
without
advanced
methods
of
engineering
have
been
occupied
and
the
lifting
of
water
for
the
supplying
of
their
paddy
fields
has
been
for
thousands
of
years
a
laborious
occupation
for
the
poorest
and
most
degraded
of
the
rural
population
in
a
system
of
civilisation
in
which
transport
costs
so
little
as
it
does
in
railway
and
freights
the
patches
of
territory
which
can
be
irrigated
by
water
brought
by
gravitation
from
the
hills
or
from
the
upper
reaches
of
rivers
are
comparatively
easy
of
access
to
a
market
this
fact
retards
the
advent
of
the
time
when
colossal
installations
for
the
throwing
of
water
upon
the
land
will
be
demanded
when
that
epoch
arrives
as
it
assuredly
will
before
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century
has
been
nearly
past
the
pumping
plants
devoted
to
the
purposes
of
irrigation
will
present
as
great
a
contrast
to
the
lifting
appliances
of
the
east
as
does
a
fully
loaded
freight
train
or
a
mammoth
steam
to
a
coolie
carrier
at
the
same
time
there
must
inevitably
be
a
great
extension
of
the
useful
purposes
to
which
small
motors
can
be
applied
in
irrigation
year
by
year
the
importance
of
the
sprinkler
not
only
for
ornamental
grounds
such
as
lawns
and
but
also
for
the
vegetable
patch
and
the
fruit
garden
becomes
more
apparent
and
efforts
are
being
made
towards
the
enlargement
of
the
arms
of
sprinkling
contrivances
to
such
an
extent
as
to
enable
them
to
throw
a
fine
shower
of
water
over
a
very
large
area
of
ground
sometimes
a
windmill
is
used
for
pumping
river
or
into
high
tanks
from
which
it
descends
by
gravitation
into
the
sprinklers
the
latter
being
operated
by
the
power
of
the
liquid
as
it
descends
this
mode
of
working
is
convenient
in
many
cases
but
a
more
important
because
a
more
widely
applicable
method
in
the
future
will
be
that
in
which
the
not
only
lifts
the
water
but
scatters
it
around
in
the
same
operation
long
screws
horizontally
fixed
between
uprights
or
set
on
a
swivel
on
a
single
high
tower
can
be
used
for
loading
the
breeze
with
a
finely
divided
shower
of
water
and
thus
projecting
the
moisture
to
very
long
distances
a
windmill
of
the
ordinary
pattern
as
used
for
gardens
may
be
fitted
with
a
long
perforated
pipe
supported
by
wire
guys
instead
of
a
vane
a
connection
being
made
by
a
between
this
pipe
and
that
which
carries
the
liquid
from
the
pump
in
this
way
every
stroke
of
the
machine
sends
innumerable
jets
of
water
out
upon
the
wind
to
be
carried
far
afield
gardening
properties
in
comparatively
dry
climates
fitted
with
machines
of
this
description
can
be
laid
out
in
different
zones
of
cultivation
determined
according
to
the
prevailing
directions
of
the
wind
and
the
consequent
distribution
of
the
water
supply
thus
if
the
wind
most
frequently
blows
from
the
west
the
plants
which
require
the
most
water
must
be
laid
out
at
the
eastern
side
not
too
far
from
the
sprinkler
facilities
for
shutting
off
the
supply
of
spray
at
will
are
of
course
very
necessary
the
system
of
watering
founded
on
this
principle
depends
upon
the
assumption
that
if
the
gardener
or
the
farmer
could
always
turn
on
the
rain
when
he
has
a
fairly
good
wind
he
would
never
lack
for
seasonable
moisture
to
nourish
his
crops
this
will
be
found
in
practice
to
apply
correctly
to
the
great
majority
of
food
plants
in
the
dry
climates
which
are
so
eminently
healthy
for
cereals
the
early
and
the
latter
rains
as
referred
to
in
scripture
are
both
needed
and
one
of
the
most
important
applications
of
cheap
power
will
be
directed
to
supplementing
the
natural
supply
either
at
one
end
or
at
the
other
the
will
be
a
personage
of
increasing
importance
in
the
rural
economy
of
the
twentieth
century
he
is
already
well
in
sight
but
for
lack
of
capital
and
of
a
due
appreciation
of
the
value
of
his
services
he
occupies
as
yet
but
a
comparatively
subordinate
position
fruits
which
are
nature
most
elaborately
edible
products
must
come
more
and
more
into
favour
as
the
complement
to
the
seed
food
represented
by
bread
as
the
demand
increases
it
will
be
more
clearly
seen
that
an
enormous
waste
of
labour
is
involved
in
the
culture
of
an
orchard
unless
its
trees
are
kept
in
perfect
health
at
the
same
time
the
law
of

the

and

greatly

in

short

become
practically
a
necessity

the

of

involved
in
planting

and
assiduously
cultivating
the

for
the

of

decimated

the
prime
cause
of

it
be

that

of

it
is
obvious
that

this

has
been
fully
realised
the
public
estimation
in

rise
very
appreciably
and

will
be
enormously
increased
very
long
tents
capable
of
covering
not
merely
one
tree
each
but
of
including
continuous
rows
stretching
perhaps
from
end
to
end
of
a
large
orchard
will
become
practically
essential
for
an
elongated
tent
of
this
description
covering
a
row
of
trees
may
be
filled
with
fumes
from
a
position
at
the
end
of
the
row
where
a
generating
plant
on
a
trolley
may
be
situated
at
the
opposite
end
another
trolley
is
stationed
and
each
movable
vehicle
carries
an
upright
mast
or
trestle
for
the
support
of
the
strong
cable
which
passes
along
the
row
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
is
stretched
taut
by
suitable
contrivances
attached
to
this
cable
is
a
flexible
tube
containing
a
number
of
apertures
and
connected
at
the
generating
station
with
the
small
furnace
or
fumigating
box
from
which
the
poisonous
gases
emanate
along
the
ground
at
each
side
of
the
row
are
stretched
two
thinner
wires
or
cables
which
hold
the
long
tent
securely
in
position
the
method
of
shifting
from
one
row
to
another
is
very
simple
both
trolleys
are
moved
into
their
new
positions
at
the
two
ends
of
a
fresh
row
the
fastenings
of
the
tent
at
the
ground
on
the
further
side
having
been
released
so
that
the
flap
of
the
tent
on
that
side
is
dragged
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
may
then
be
drawn
over
the
top
cable
and
down
upon
the
other
side
seen
from
the
end
the
movements
of
the
tent
thus
resemble
those
of
a
trestle
in
the
form
of
an
inverted
v
which
advances
by
having
one
leg
flung
over
the
other
for
this
arrangement
of
a
fumigating
tent
it
is
best
that
the
top
cable
should
consist
of
a
double
wire
the
fabric
of
the
tent
itself
being
gripped
between
the
two
wires
and
a
flexible
tube
being
attached
to
each
as
progress
is
made
from
one
row
to
another
through
the
drawing
of
one
flap
over
the
other
it
is
obvious
that
the
tent
turns
inside
out
at
each
step
and
if
only
one
cable
and
one
tube
were
used
it
would
be
difficult
to
avoid
permitting
the
gas
to
escape
into
the
outer
air
at
one
stage
or
another
but
when
the
tubes
are
duplicated
in
the
manner
described
there
is
always
one
which
is
actually
within
the
tent
no
matter
what
position
the
latter
may
be
in
it
is
then
only
necessary
that
the
connection
with
the
generating
apparatus
at
the
end
of
the
row
should
be
made
after
each
movement
with
the
tube
which
is
inside
the
tent
for
very
long
rows
of
trees
the
top
cable
needs
to
be
supported
by
intermediate
trestles
besides
the
uprights
at
the
ends
the
gas
and
tent
can
be
used
for
various
other
purposes
besides
those
of
killing
pests
on
fruit
trees
one
of
the
regular
tasks
of
the
will
be
connected
with
the
artificial
fertilisation
of
trees
on
the
wholesale
scale
and
for
a
purpose
such
as
this
it
is
necessary
that
the
trees
to
be
operated
upon
shall
not
be
open
to
the
outside
atmosphere
but
that
the
pollen
dust
with
which
the
air
inside
the
tent
is
to
be
laden
shall
be
strictly
confined
during
a
stated
period
of
time
those
methods
of
fertilisation
with
which
the
has
in
recent
years
worked
such
wonders
can
undoubtedly
be
utilised
for
many
objects
besides
those
of
the
variation

mining
exploratory
telegraphy
seems
likely
to
claim
a
position
in
the
twentieth
century
economics
of
mining
its
particular
rôle
being
to
aid
in
the
determination
of
the
strike
of
lodes
one
main
reason
for
this
conclusion
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
formations
which
carry
metalliferous
ores
are
nearly
always
more
moist
than
the
surrounding
country
and
are
therefore
better
conductors
of
the
electrical
current
indeed
there
is
good
ground
for
the
belief
that
this
moistness
of
the
fissures
and
lodes
in
which
metals
chiefly
occur
has
been
in
part
the
original
cause
of
the
deposition
of
those
metals
from
their
aqueous
solutions
percolating
along
the
routes
in
which
gravitation
carries
them
in
the
volumes
of
for
and
will
be
found
communications
in
which
the
present
writer
has
set
forth
some
of
the
arguments
tending
to
strengthen
the
hypothesis
that
of
electricity
exercise
an
appreciable
influence
in
determining
the
occurrence
of
gold
and
silver
and
that
they
have
probably
been
to
some
extent
instrumental
in
settling
the
distribution
of
other
metals
the
existence
of
currents
of
electricity
passing
through
the
crust
and
on
its
surface
along
the
lines
of
least
resistance
has
long
been
an
established
fact
experiments
conducted
at
harvard
by
professor
trowbridge
have
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
by
means
of
such
delicate
apparatus
as
the
telephone
and
microphone
it
is
possible
for
the
observer
to
state
in
which
direction
from
a
given
point
the
best
line
of
conductivity
runs
under
certain
conditions
the
return
current
is
so
materially
facilitated
when
brought
along
the
line
of
a
watercourse
or
a
moist
patch
of
the
earth
crust
that
the
words
heard
through
a
telephone
are
distinctly
more
audible
than
they
are
at
a
similar
distance
when
there
is
no
moist
return
circuit
deflections
of
the
compass
due
to
the
passing
of
along
the
natural
lines
of
conductivity
in
the
soil
or
the
rocks
are
so
frequently
noticed
as
to
be
a
source
of
calculation
to
the
scientific
surveyor
and
astronomer
it
can
thus
be
shown
not
only
that
definite
lines
of
least
electrical
resistance
exist
in
the
earth
but
also
that
natural
currents
of
greater
or
less
strength
are
almost
constantly
passing
along
these
lines
some
of
the
curious
and
puzzling
empirical
rules
gained
from
the
experience
of
miners
in
regard
to
the
varying
richness
and
poorness
of
mineral
lodes
according
to
the
directions
in
which
they
strike
whether
north
south
east
or
west
may
very
probably
be
explained
and
to
some
extent
justified
by
the
fuller
light
which
science
may
throw
upon
the
conditions
determining
the
action
of
in
producing
results
similar
to
those
of
electro
deposition
if
in
a
given
region
of
a
country
the
geological
formation
is
such
as
to
lend
itself
to
the
easy
conduction
of
currents
in
one
direction
rather
than
in
another
the
phenomenon
referred
to
may
perhaps
be
partially
explained
but
on
the
other
hand
the
origin
of
the
generating
force
which
sets
the
currents
in
motion
must
first
be
studied
before
the
true
conditions
determining
their
direction
can
be
understood
in
other
words
much
that
is
now
obscure
including
the
true
origin
of
the
earth
magnetism
must
be
to
some
extent
cleared
up
before
the
reasons
for
the
seemingly
erratic
strike
of
and
of
richness
in
mineral
lodes
can
be
fully
explained
practice
however
may
here
get
some
distance
ahead
of
science
and
may
indeed
lend
some
assistance
to
the
latter
by
providing
empirical
data
upon
which
it
may
proceed
when
once
it
is
clearly
seen
that
by
delicate
electrical
instruments
such
as
the
telephone
the
microphone
and
the
coherer
as
used
in
wireless
telegraphy
the
line
of
least
resistance
on
any
given
area
of
the
earth
surface
or
any
given
piece
of
its
crust
may
be
determined
the
bearing
of
that
fact
in
showing
the
best
lines
of
moisture
and
therefore
the
likeliest
lines
for
mineral
lodes
will
soon
be
recognised
in
a
very
practical
manner
no
class
of
men
is
keener
or
more
enterprising
in
its
applications
of
the
latest
practical
science
to
the
getting
of
money
than
mining
speculators
nor
have
they
at
all
missed
the
significance
of
moist
bands
occurring
in
any
underground
workings
as
a
very
favourable
augury
for
the
close
approach
of
highly
mineralised
lodes
if
then
moisture
be
favourable
first
to
the
presence
of
country
and
secondly
to
the
conductivity
of
electrical
lines
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
a
hopeful
field
for
the
exercise
of
ingenuity
in
bringing
the
one
into
a
practical
relation
to
the
other
the
occult
scientific
reasons
for
the
connection
may
not
be
understood
but
it
is
sufficient
for
practical
purposes
to
know
that
in
a
certain
line
from
the
surface
outcropping
of
a
mineral
lode
there
has
been
given
a
demonstration
of
less
electrical
resistance
along
that
line
than
is
experienced
in
any
other
direction
also
to
know
that
such
a
line
of
least
resistance
is
proved
to
have
been
in
almost
innumerable
instances
coincident
with
the
best
line
of
country
the
case
is
similar
to
that
of
the
rotation
of
crops
in
its
relation
to
scientific
microbiology
the
art
of
mining
may
get
ahead
of
the
science
of
physiography
in
respect
of
and
lines
of
least
resistance
as
showing
where
mineral
lodes
may
be
expected
yet
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
science
will
not
in
the
one
case
lag
so
far
behind
as
it
has
done
in
the
other
the
first
notable
service
rendered
by
systems
of
the
kind
indicated
will
no
doubt
be
in
connection
with
the
rediscovery
of
very
valuable
lodes
which
have
been
followed
up
for
certain
distances
and
then
lost
in
an
instance
of
this
description
much
fruitless
exploration
drives
winzes
and
may
have
been
carried
out
in
the
surrounding
country
rock
near
the
place
where
the
lode
last
cut
out
but
in
the
absence
of
anything
to
guide
the
mine
manager
and
surveyor
as
to
the
direction
which
the
search
should
take
nothing
but
loss
has
been
involved
in
the
quest
several
properties
in
the
same
neighbourhood
have
perhaps
been
abandoned
or
suspended
in
operation
owing
to
very
similar
causes
the
whole
group
may
perhaps
have
then
been
bought
by
an
exploration
company
whose
will
be
as
follows
the
terminal
of
the
electrical
exploration
plant
is
fixed
at
the
end
of
the
lode
where
it
gave
out
or
else
immersed
in
the
water
of
the
shaft
which
is
in
connection
with
the
lode
system
and
another
similar
terminal
is
fixed
by
turns
in
each
shaft
of
the
contiguous
group
the
electrical
resistances
offered
to
the
return
currents
or
to
the
wireless
vibrations
are
then
carefully
measured
and
the
direction
of
the
lost
lode
is
taken
to
be
that
which
shows
the
least
resistance
in
proportion
to
the
distance
traversed
the
work
of
carrying
out
such
an
investigation
must
of
necessity
be
somewhat
elaborate
because
it
may
be
necessary
to
connect
in
turn
each
shaft
as
a
centre
with
every
one
of
the
others
as
subsidiaries
but
the
guidance
afforded
even
of
a
negative
character
resulting
in
the
avoidance
of
useless
cutting
and
blasting
through
heavy
country
will
prove
invaluable
many
matters
will
require
attention
in
following
out
such
a
line
of
practical
investigation
which
are
to
some
extent
foreign
to
the
usual
work
of
the
mining
engineer
for
example
the
conditions
which
determine
the
of
an
require
to
be
carefully
noted
because
it
would
be
fallacious
to
reason
that
because
the
line
of
least
resistance
lay
in
a
certain
direction
therefore
an
almost
continuous
lode
would
be
found
moreover
the
electrical
method
must
only
be
relied
upon
as
a
guide
when
carefully
checked
by
other
considerations
other
kinds
of
moist
formations
both
metalliferous
and
may
influence
the
lines
of
least
electrical
resistance
besides
those
containing
the
particular
metal
which
is
being
sought
for
the
water
difficulty
has
enforced
the
abandonment
of
very
many
valuable
mines
in
which
the
positions
of
the
lodes
are
still
well
known
sunken
riches
lying
beneath
the
sea
in
old
spanish
galleons
have
excited
the
cupidity
and
the
ingenuity
of
speculators
and
engineers
but
the
total
amount
of
wealth
thus
hidden
away
from
view
is
a
mere
insignificant
fraction
of
the
value
of
the
rich
metalliferous
lodes
which
lie
below
the
water
level
in
flooded
mines
the
point
in
depth
at
which
the
accumulation
of
the
water
renders
further
following
of
the
lode
impracticable
may
vary
in
different
countries
in
china
throughout
whole
provinces
there
is
hardly
a
mine
to
be
found
in
which
the
efforts
of
the
miners
have
not
been
absolutely
paralyzed
directly
the
was
reached
but
in
western
lands
as
well
as
in
south
africa
and
australia
the
immense
capacity
of
the
pumps
employed
for
keeping
down
the
water
has
enabled
comparatively
wet
ground
to
be
worked
to
a
very
considerable
depth
the
limit
nevertheless
has
been
reached
in
many
rich
mining
districts
pumps
of
the
most
approved
type
and
driven
by
the
largest
and
most
economical
have
done
their
best
in
the
struggle
against
the
difficulty
and
yet
the
water
has
beaten
them
rich
as
are
the
lodes
which
lie
beneath
the
water
the
mining
engineer
is
compelled
to
confess
that
the
metal
value
which
they
contain
would
not
leave
after
extraction
a
sufficient
margin
to
pay
for
the
enormous
cost
of
draining
the
shafts
in
some
instances
indeed
it
remains
exceedingly
doubtful
whether
pumps
of
the
largest
capacity
ever
attained
in
any
part
of
the
world
would
cope
with
the
task
entailed
in
draining
the
abandoned
shafts
the
underground
workings
have
practically
tapped
subterranean
rivers
which
to
all
intents
and
purposes
are
inexhaustible
or
it
may
be
that
the
mine
has
penetrated
into
some
hollow
basin
of
impermeable
strata
filled
only
with
porous
material
which
is
kept
constantly
saturated
to
drain
such
a
piece
of
country
would
mean
practically
the
emptying
of
a
lake
subaqueous
mining
is
therefore
one
of
the
big
problems
which
the
mining
engineer
of
the
twentieth
century
must
tackle
to
a
certain
extent
he
will
receive
guidance
in
his
difficult
task
from
the
experiences
of
those
who
have
virtually
undertaken
submarine
mining
when
in
search
of
treasure
lost
in
sunken
ships
the
two
methods
of
pumping
and
of
subaqueous
mining
will
in
some
places
be
carried
out
conjointly
in
such
instances
the
work
assigned
to
the
pumping
machinery
will
be
to
keep
free
of
water
those
drives
in
which
good
bodies
of
ore
were
exposed
when
last
profitable
work
was
being
carried
on
all
below
that
level
will
be
permitted
to
fill
with
water
and
the
work
of
boring
by
means
of
compressed
air
of
blasting
out
the
rock
and
of
filling
the
trucks
will
all
be
performed
under
the
surface
for
the
shallower
depths
large
tanks
open
at
the
top
will
be
constructed
and
slung
upon
trucks
run
on
rails
along
the
lowest
drives
practically
this
arrangement
means
that
an
iron
shaft
closed
at
the
sides
and
bottom
and
movable
on
rails
laid
above
the
surface
will
be
employed
to
keep
the
water
out
somewhat
similar
appliances
have
been
found
very
useful
in
the
operations
for
laying
the
foundations
of
bridges
the
details
requiring
to
be
worked
out
for
the
successful
working
of
subaqueous
systems
of
mining
are
numerous
and
important
chief
among
these
must
be
the
needful
provision
for
enabling
the
miner
to
see
through
strong
glass
windows
near
the
bottom
of
the
iron
shaft
by
the
aid
of
electric
lights
slung
in
the
water
outside
and
thus
to
estimate
the
correct
positions
at
which
to
place
his
drills
and
his
explosives
for
this
reason
the
work
of
the
day
must
be
systematically
divided
so
that
at
stated
intervals
the
clay
and
other
materials
held
in
suspension
by
the
disturbed
water
may
be
allowed
to
settle
and
the
water
be
made
comparatively
clear
specially
constructed
strainers
for
the
mechanical
filtration
of
the
water
near
the
ore
face
and
probably
also
chemical
and
other
precipitates
will
be
largely
resorted
to
for
facilitating
this
important
operation
beside
each
window
will
be
provided
strong
flexible
sleeves
terminating
in
gloves
into
which
the
miner
can
place
his
hands
for
the
purpose
of
adjusting
the
various
pieces
of
machinery
required
beyond
this
of
course
every
possible
application
of
mechanical
power
operated
from
above
will
be
resorted
to
not
only
for
drilling
but
also
for
gripping
and
removing
the
shattered
pieces
of
rock
and
ore
resulting
from
the
blasting
operations
from
the
unwatered
drive
or
tunnel
downwards
the
method
of
working
as
just
described
may
be
characterised
as
an
underground
application
of
the
system
no
elaborate
honeycombing
of
the
country
below
the
will
be
economically
possible
as
it
is
when
working
in
dry
rock
but
then
again
it
is
becoming
plain
to
many
experts
in
mining
that
in
working
downwards
from
the
surface
itself
the
future
of
their
industry
offers
a
wide
field
for
the
extension
of
the
system
in
proportion
as
power
becomes
cheaper
the
expense
attendant
upon
the
removal
of
clay
sand
and
rock
for
the
purpose
of
laying
bare
the
cap
of
a
lode
at
a
moderate
depth
becomes
less
formidable
when
balanced
against
the
economy
introduced
by
methods
which
admit
of
the
miner
working
in
the
open
air
although
at
the
bottom
of
a
kind
of
deep
quarry
while
the
system
of
close
mining
will
hold
its
own
in
a
very
large
number
of
localities
still
there
are
other
places
where
the
increasing
cheapness
of
power
for
working
an
and
the
coincident
increase
in
the
scarcity
and
cost
of
timber
for
supporting
the
ground
will
gradually
shift
the
balance
of
advantage
on
to
the
side
of
the
open
method
at
the
same
time
great
improvements
are
now
foreshadowed
in
regard
to
the
modes
of
working
mines
by
shafts
and
drives
some
shafts
will
in
future
be
worked
practically
as
the
vertical
portions
of
tramways
having
endless
wire
ropes
to
convey
the
trucks
direct
from
the
face
or
the
stope
to
the
reduction
works
and
thus
an
immense
saving
will
be
effected
in
the
costs
incidental
to
mining
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
place
at
which
it
has
been
won
the
ore
will
be
drawn
in
trucks
attached
to
the
endless
wire
rope
first
along
the
drive
on
the
horizontal
and
then
up
an
incline
increasing
in
sharpness
till
the
shaft
is
reached
where
the
direction
of
motion
becomes
vertical
near
the
surface
again
there
is
an
incline
gradually
leading
to
the
level
of
the
ground
or
rather
of
the
elevated
tramway
from
which
the
stuff
is
to
be
tipped
into
the
mill
or
if
it
be
mullock
on
to
the
waste
heap
the
return
of
each
truck
is
effected
along
the
reverse
side
of
the
endless
cable
ventilation
is
an
incidental
work
of
much
importance
which
it
becomes
more
practicable
to
carry
out
in
a
satisfactory
manner
when
an
endless
system
of
truck
conveyance
has
been
provided
reaching
from
the
to
the
mill
and
thence
back
again
the
reason
is
mainly
that
the
same
routes
which
have
been
prepared
for
this
traffic
are
available
for
the
supply
of
air
and
for
the
return
current
which
must
carry
off
the
accumulated
bad
gases
from
the
underground
workings
fans
operated
by
the
cable
at
various
places
along
the
line
of
communication
keep
up
a
brisk
exchange
of
air
and
the
coming
and
going
of
the
trucks
themselves
help
to
maintain
a
good
healthy
atmosphere
even
in
the
most
remote
parts
of
the
mine
in
very
deep
mines
where
the
heat
becomes
unbearable
after
a
few
minutes
unless
a
strong
wind
be
kept
going
underground
the
forward
and
backward
courses
for
traffic
and
ventilation
together
are
specially
advantageous
prices
during
the
twentieth
century
will
depend
more
definitely
upon
the
cost
of
than
they
have
ever
done
at
any
former
time
in
the
world
history
in
spite
of
all
the
opposition
which
fanaticism
and
ignorance
could
offer
to
the
natural
trend
of
events
in
the
commercial
and
financial
life
of
the
world
the
gold
standard
now
rests
on
an
impregnable
base
and
every
year
witnesses
some
new
triumph
for
those
who
accept
it
as
the
foundation
of
the
civilised
monetary
system
this
being
the
case
it
is
obvious
that
the
conditions
affecting
the
production
of
gold
must
possess
a
very
peculiar
interest
even
for
those
who
have
never
lived
within
hundreds
of
miles
of
any
gold
mine
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
habit
of
every
man
is
to
measure
daily
and
even
hourly
the
value
of
his
efforts
at
producing
what
the
economist
calls
utilities
against
those
of
the
gold
miner
if
therefore
the
latter
successfully
calls
to
his
aid
mechanical
giants
who
render
his
work
easier
and
who
enable
him
to
throw
into
the
world
markets
a
larger
proportion
of
gold
for
a
given
amount
of
effort
the
result
must
be
that
the
price
of
gold
must
fall
or
in
other
words
the
prices
of
general
commodities
must
rise
if
on
the
other
hand
all
other
industries
have
been
subjected
to
the
like
improved
conditions
of
working
the
effect
must
be
to
that
extent
to
balance
the
rise
and
keep
prices
comparatively
steady
from
this
point
of
view
it
will
be
seen
that
the
interests
of
all
those
who
desire
to
see
a
rise
in
general
prices
are
to
a
large
extent
bound
up
in
the
improvement
of
methods
for
the
extraction
of
gold
the
question
of
cheap
power
does
not
by
any
means
monopolise
the
data
upon
which
such
a
problem
can
be
provisionally
decided
and
yet
it
may
be
broadly
stated
that
in
the
main
the
increased
output
of
gold
in
the
future
depends
upon
the
more
economical
production
and
application
of
power
measured
against
other
commodities
which
also
depend
mainly
upon
the
same
factor
gold
will
probably
remain
very
steady
while
in
contrast
with
those
things
which
require
for
the
production
taste
and
skill
rather
than
mere
brute
force
or
mechanical
power
gold
will
fall
in
value
in
other
words
the
classes
of
articles
and
services
depending
upon
the
exercise
of
man
higher
faculties
of
skill
taste
and
mental
power
will
rise
in
price
getting
gold
practically
means
in
modern
times
crushing
stone
this
statement
is
subject
to
fewer
and
fewer
exceptions
from
one
decade
to
another
according
as
the
alluvial
deposits
in
the
various
countries
become
more
or
less
completely
worked
out
a
partial
revival
of
alluvial
mining
has
been
brought
about
through
the
application
of
the
giant
dredger
to
cheapening
the
process
of
extracting
exceedingly
small
quantities
of
gold
from
alluvial
drift
and
dirt
yet
on
the
whole
it
will
be
found
that
the
industry
almost
all
the
world
over
is
getting
down
to
the
of
by
crushing
and
by
simple
methods
of
separation
thus
practically
we
may
say
that
the
cost
of
gold
is
the
cost
of
power
in
those
usually
secluded
localities
where
the
precious
metal
is
found
in
quantities
sufficient
to
tempt
the
investment
of
capital
from
this
it
may
be
inferred
that
the
cheap
transmission
of
power
by
the
electric
current
will
effect
a
more
profound
revolution
in
the
industry
than
in
almost
any
other
the
main
deterrent
to
the
investing
of
money
in
opening
up
a
new
gold
mine
consists
in
the
fact
that
a
very
large
and
certain
expense
is
involved
in
the
conveyance
of
heavy
machinery
to
the
locality
while
the
results
are
very
largely
in
the
nature
of
a
lottery
when
however
the
power
is
supplied
from
a
central
station
and
when
economical
types
of
crusher
are
more
fully
introduced
this
deterrent
will
to
a
large
extent
disappear
the
cables
which
radiate
from
the
central
electric
in
all
directions
can
be
very
readily
devoted
to
the
furnishing
of
power
to
new
mines
as
soon
as
it
is
found
that
the
older
ones
have
been
proved
unprofitable
no
one
will
think
of
carrying
ore
to
the
power
when
it
is
far
more
economical
and
profitable
to
carry
power
to
the
ore
in
this
connection
the
principle
of
the
division
of
labour
becomes
very
important
in
its
bearing
upon
the
mining
industry
generally
whether
in
its
application
to
the
precious
metals
or
to
those
which
are
termed
the
baser
and
even
in
the
work
of
raising
coal
and
other
minerals
the
fact
that
nearly
all
mines
occur
in
groups
will
greatly
aid
in
determining
the
separation
of
the
work
of
supplying
power
as
a
distinct
industry
from
that
of
mining
is
an
art
which
was
in
a
very
rudimentary
state
at
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
the
great
discoveries
of
gold
silver
and
other
metals
began
to
influence
the
world
markets
in
so
striking
a
manner
the
ancients
used
the
jigger
in
the
form
of
a
wicker
basket
filled
with
crushed
ore
and
jerked
by
hand
up
and
down
in
water
for
the
purpose
of
causing
the
lighter
parts
to
rise
to
the
top
while
the
more
valuable
portions
made
their
way
to
the
bottom
in
this
way
the
copper
mines
of
spain
were
worked
in
the
days
of
the
roman
empire
and
probably
the
system
had
existed
from
time
immemorial
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
the
miner
had
got
so
far
as
to
hitch
his
jigging
basket
or
sieve
on
to
some
part
of
his
machinery
generally
his
pumping
engine
and
thus
to
avoid
the
wearing
muscular
effort
involved
in
moving
it
in
the
water
by
hand
it
was
not
until
the
obvious
mistake
of
using
a
machine
which
permitted
the
finest
and
sometimes
the
richest
parts
of
the
ore
to
escape
had
been
for
many
years
ineffectually
admitted
that
the
vanner
or
moving
endless
band
with
a
stream
of
water
running
on
it
was
invented
with
the
special
object
of
treating
the
finer
stuff
jiggers
and
vanners
form
the
staple
of
the
miner
machinery
at
the
present
day
the
efficiency
of
the
latter
class
of
separating
machines
working
on
certain
kinds
of
finely
crushed
ore
is
already
so
great
that
it
may
be
said
without
exaggeration
that
it
could
hardly
be
much
improved
upon
so
far
as
percentage
of
extraction
is
concerned
and
yet
the
waste
of
power
which
is
involved
is
something
outrageous
for
the
treatment
of
a
thin
layer
of
slimes
perhaps
no
thicker
than
a
sixpence
it
is
necessary
to
violently
agitate
with
a
reciprocating
movement
a
large
and
heavy
framework
sometimes
the
quantity
of
stuff
put
through
as
the
result
of
one
working
for
an
hour
is
not
more
than
about
a
hundredweight
the
consequence
is
that
in
large
mines
the
nests
of
vanners
comprise
scores
or
even
hundreds
of
machines
when
shaking
tables
are
used
without
the
addition
of
the
endless
moving
bands
good
work
can
also
be
done
but
the
waste
of
power
is
still
excessive
the
vanning
spade
and
shallow
washing
dish
are
the
prototypes
of
this
kind
of
machinery
let
any
one
place
a
line
of
wet
ore
on
a
flat
spade
and
draw
the
latter
quickly
through
still
water
at
the
same
time
shaking
it
and
the
result
on
inspection
if
the
speed
has
not
been
so
great
as
to
sweep
all
the
fine
grains
off
the
surface
will
be
that
the
heavier
parts
of
the
ore
will
be
found
to
have
ranged
themselves
on
the
side
towards
which
the
spade
was
propelled
in
its
progress
through
the
water
a
sheet
of
glass
serves
for
the
purpose
of
this
experiment
even
better
than
a
metal
implement
but
the
spade
is
the
appliance
among
miners
for
testing
some
kinds
of
finely
crushed
ore
by
mechanical
separation
it
is
to
be
observed
that
besides
the
shaking
motion
imparted
to
the
apparatus
the
only
active
agency
in
the
distribution
of
the
particles
is
the
sidelong
movement
of
the
spade
relatively
to
the
water
but
it
makes
little
or
no
difference
whether
the
water
moves
sidelong
on
the
spade
or
the
latter
progresses
through
the
liquid
the
ore
will
range
itself
accurately
all
the
same
consequently
if
a
circular
tank
be
used
and
if
the
water
be
set
in
rotary
motion
the
ore
on
a
sheet
of
glass
held
steady
will
arrange
itself
in
the
same
way
if
the
ore
be
fed
in
small
streams
of
water
down
the
inclined
surfaces
of
sloping
glass
or
other
smooth
shelves
set
close
to
and
parallel
with
one
another
near
the
periphery
of
such
a
vessel
of
moving
water
the
resultant
motions
of
the
heavy
and
of
the
light
particles
respectively
in
passing
down
these
shelves
will
be
found
to
be
so
different
that
the
good
stuff
can
be
caught
by
a
receptacle
placed
at
one
part
while
the
tailings
fall
into
another
receiver
which
is
differently
situated
at
the
place
where
the
lighter
grains
fall
the
main
essential
in
this
particular
application
of
the
art
of
vanning
is
simply
that
the
water
should
move
or
drift
transversely
to
lines
of
ore
passing
while
held
in
suspension
with
water
down
a
smooth
sloping
surface
in
dealing
with
some
very
light
classes
of
ore
and
especially
such
as
may
naturally
crush
very
fine
that
is
to
say
with
a
large
proportion
of
impalpable
slimes
there
is
a
decided
advantage
in
causing
the
water
to
drift
sidelong
on
the
smooth
shelf
by
other
means
than
the
motion
in
a
circular
tank
adopting
nearly
the
form
of
the
side
delivery
manner
in
which
the
moving
band
is
canted
to
the
side
and
the
stuff
runs
off
sideways
the
sloping
smooth
shelf
can
be
worked
for
ore
separation
with
merely
the
streams
of
water
holding
the
fine
sand
in
suspension
running
down
at
fixed
intervals
a
glass
covering
is
placed
very
close
to
this
surface
on
which
the
streams
run
and
between
the
two
is
driven
laterally
a
strong
current
of
wind
by
means
of
a
which
causes
each
stream
of
water
to
drift
a
little
sidewards
carrying
with
it
the
lighter
particles
but
leaving
on
its
windward
side
a
line
of
nearly
pure
ore
these
small
runlets
can
be
multiplied
on
a
shelf
measuring
six
or
eight
feet
in
length
to
such
an
extent
that
the
machine
can
put
through
as
much
ore
as
a
dozen
vanners
consuming
only
a
mere
fraction
of
the
power
necessary
to
drive
one
machine
of
the
older
type
cyanide
solution
instead
of
water
is
very
advantageously
employed
for
this
kind
of
operation
in
the
case
of
extracting
gold
from
crushed
ore
the
method
is
to
pump
the
liquid
from
the
tanks
in
which
it
is
stored
and
to
allow
it
to
flow
back
by
way
of
the
vanning
apparatus
thus
providing
not
only
for
catching
the
grains
of
gold
by
the
concentrating
machine
but
also
for
the
dissolving
of
the
fine
impalpable
gold
dust
or
natural
precipitate
by
the
action
of

upon
the
use
of
this
latter
chemical
will
be
based
the
main
improvements
in
the

during
the
twentieth
century
and
conversely
the
applications
of
the
old
system
of
amalgamating
with
mercury

order
to
catch

be

fine

worked
with

perform
three
operations
at

namely
first
the

grains
second
the
production
of
a
rich
concentrate
of

having
gold
in

third
the

very
refractory

of

of

the
finer

of

the

of

and
in
combination
with
rushing
appliances
operated
by
cheap
power
in
almost
unlimited
quantities
it
will
materially
assist
in
multiplying
the
world
supply
of
metals
this
again
will
aid
in
promoting
the
further
extension
of
machinery
gold
will
be
produced
in
greater
abundance
for
what
is
called
the
machinery
of
commerce
and
the
base
metals
particularly
the
new
alloys
of
steel
and
also
copper
and
aluminium
will
be
more
largely
produced
for
engineering
and
electrical
purposes
the
importation
particularly
to
england
and
scotland
of
large
quantities
of
iron
ore
will
cause
one
of
the
first
notable
developments
in
the
mining
and
of
the
twentieth
century
so
far
as
the
united
kingdom
is
concerned
the
urgent
necessity
for
an
extension
in
the
manufacture
of
bessemer
steel
and
of
the
new
and
remarkable
alloys
in
which
very
small
quantities
of
other
metals
are
employed
in
order
to
impart
altogether
exceptional
qualities
to
iron
must
accentuate
the
demand
for
those
kinds
of
ore
which
lend
themselves
most
readily
to
the
special
requirements
of
the
works
on
hand
hence
the
question
of
the
transport
of
special
kinds
of
iron
ore
over
longer
distances
will
have
to
be
faced
as
it
has
been
already
to
a
limited
degree
and
not
only
in
reference
to
ores
containing
a
low
percentage
of
phosphorus
and
therefore
exceptionally
suitable
for
the
bessemerising
process
but
also
in
regard
to
ores
which
are
amenable
to
magnetic
separation
magnetite
indeed
must
bulk
more
largely
in
the
future
as
a
source
of
iron
particularly
because
it
is
susceptible
of
magnetic
separation
a
process
which
as
yet
is
only
in
its
infancy
containing
as
it
does
a
larger
percentage
of
iron
than
any
other
source
from
which
the
metal
is
commercially
extracted
its
employment
as
an
ore
results
in
great
economy
of
fuel
as
well
as
a
reduction
in
the
proportionate
costs
of
transport
when
ores
of
iron
require
to
be
brought
from
oversea
places
it
is
obvious
that
those
which
will
concentrate
to
the
purest
product
possible
and
which
are
in
other
respects
specially
applicable
to
the
production
of
grades
of
steel
of
exceptional
tensile
strength
will
have
the
preference
magnetic
concentration
or
the
separation
of
an
ore
from
the
waste
gangue
by
the
attraction
of
powerful
must
therefore
occupy
a
much
more
prominent
place
in
the
metallurgy
of
the
future
than
it
has
in
that
of
the
past
not
only
may
ironstone
containing
magnetite
be
separated
from
other
material
but
several
important
minerals
acquire
the
property
of
becoming
magnetic
when
subjected
to
the
operation
of
roasting
sometimes
through
a
sulphide
being
converted
into
a
magnetic
oxide
by
the
use
of
powerful
the
poles
of
which
are
brought
to
a
point
or
to
a
nearly
sharp
the
intensity
of
the
magnetic
field
can
be
so
enormously
increased
that
even
minerals
which
are
only
feebly
magnetic
can
readily
be
separated
by
being
lifted
away
from
the
material
in
some
systems
the
crushed
ore
is
simply
permitted
to
fall
in
a
continuous
stream
through
a
strong
magnetic
field
and
the
magnetic
particles
are
diverted
out
of
the
vertical
in
their
descent
by
the
operation
of
the
magnets
nor
is
it
only
those
minerals
that
actually
become
themselves
magnetic
on
being
roasted
which
can
be
so
differentiated
from
the
material
with
which
they
are
associated
as
to
be
amenable
to
magnetic
separation
even
differences
in
hygroscopic
properties
that
is
to
say
in
the
degree
of
avidity
with
which
a
mineral
takes
up
moisture
from
the
atmosphere
may
be
made
available
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
a
commercially
valuable
separation
this
is
especially
the
case
with
some
complex
ores
in
which
one
constituent
on
being
roasted
acquires
a
much
greater
hygroscopic
power
than
the
others
the
grains
of
the
crushed
and
roasted
ore
becoming
damp
and
sticky
while
those
of
the
other
minerals
remain
comparatively
dry
by
mixing
with
an
ore
of
this
kind
after
it
has
been
allowed
to
weather
for
a
short
time
some
magnetite
the
strongly
hygroscopic
constituents
can
be
made
practically
magnetic
because
the
magnetic
impalpable
dust
adheres
to
them
while
it
remains
separate
from
the
grains
of
the
other
minerals
hardness
as
well
as
magnetic
attraction
is
a
property
of
ore
which
has
as
yet
been
made
available
to
only
a
very
slight
extent
as
the
basis
of
a
system
of
separation
if
a
quantity
of
mixed
fragments
of
glass
and
plumbago
be
pounded
together
in
a
mortar
with
only
a
moderate
degree
of
pressure
so
as
to
avoid
as
far
as
possible
the
breaking
of
the
glass
there
will
soon
come
a
stage
at
which
the
softer
material
can
be
separated
from
the
harder
simply
by
means
of
a
fine
sieve
there
are
many
mineral
mixtures
in
the
crushing
of
which
a
similar
result
occurs
in
a
very
marked
degree
and
indeed
there
are
none
which
do
not
show
the
peculiarity
more
or
less
because
the
constituents
of
an
ore
are
never
of
exactly
the
same
degree
of
hardness
when
the
worthless
parts
are
the
softer
and
therefore
have
the
greater
tendency
to
slime
the
ore
is
very
readily
dressed
to
a
high
percentage
by
means
of
water
but
when
the
reverse
is
the
case
and
the
valuable
constituents
through
their
softness
get
reduced
to
a
fine
pulp
long
before
the
other
parts
the
ordinary
operations
of
the
become
much
more
difficult
to
carry
out
most
elaborate
plants
are
constructed
with
the
view
to
causing
the
crushing
surfaces
whether
of
rolls
or
of
jaws
to
merely
tap
each
piece
of
stone
so
as
to
break
it
in
bits
without
creating
much
dust
this
operation
is
repeated
over
and
over
again
but
the
stuff
which
is
fine
enough
to
go
to
the
concentrator
is
removed
by
sieving
after
each
operation
of
the
kind
and
the
successive
rolls
or
other
crushers
are
set
to
a
finer
and
finer
gauge
so
that
there
is
a
progressive
approach
to
the
conditions
of
coarse
sand
which
is
that
specially
desired
by
the
much
of
this
elaboration
will
be
seen
to
be
needless
and
moreover
better
commercial
results
will
be
obtained
when
it
is
more
clearly
perceived
that
the
recovery
of
a
valuable
ore
in
the
form
of
a
fine
slime
may
be
economically
effected
by
the
action
of
grinders
specially
constructed
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
the
hard
constituents
of
the
ore
to
remain
in
comparatively
large
grains
while
the
other
and
softer
minerals
are
reduced
to
fine
slimes
or
dust
in
other
words

grinding
plant
purposely
designed
to
carry
out
its
work
in
exactly
the
opposite
way
to
that
which
has
been
described
as
the
system
aimed
at

ordinary
crushing
machinery

its
place
in
the
future
of
metallurgy
light
mullers
are
employed
to
pound
or
to
press
together
the
crushed
grains
for
a
given
length
of
time
and
then
sieving
machinery
completes
the
operation
by
taking
out
the
dust
from
the
more
palpable
grains
in
some
cases
it
will
be
found
that
an
improvement
can
be
effected
by
bringing
about
the
separation
of
a
finer
grade
of
dust
than
could
be
taken
out
by
any
kind
of
sieve
which
is
commercially
practicable
on
the
large
scale
this

to

the
enormous
waste
involved
in
the
common
methods
of
heating
is
one
of
the
principal
defects
of
household
economy
which
will
be
corrected
during
the
twentieth
century
different
authorities
have
made
varying
estimates
of
the
proportion
between
the
heat
which
goes
up
the
chimney
of
an
ordinary
grate
and
that
which
actually
passes
out
into
the
room
fulfilling
its
purpose
of
maintaining
an
equable
temperature
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
at
the
very
least
something
like
of
the
heat
generated
by
the
domestic
fires
of
even
the
most
advanced
and
civilised
nations
goes
absolutely
to
waste
or
rather
to
worse
than
waste
because
the
extra
smoke
produced
in
creating
it
only
serves
to
pollute
the
atmosphere
in
the
cities
some
degree
of
progress
has
been
made
in
the
introduction
of
heating
appliances
which
really
give
warmth
to
a
room
without
losing
at
least
per
cent
of
their
heat
but
in
the
country
districts
where
open
fireplaces
are
the
rule
it
is
not
unusual
to
find
that
more
than
ninety
per
cent
of
the
heat
produced
behind
the
domestic
hearth
goes
up
the
chimney
sentiment
has
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
retarding
progress
in
the
direction
of
improved
appliances
for
countless
ages
the
hearth
has
been
so
to
speak
the
domestic
altar
around
which
some
of
the
most
sacred
associations
of
mankind
have
gathered
and
popular
sentiment
has
declared
that
it
is
not
for
the
iconoclastic
inventor
or
architect
to
improve
it
out
of
existence
or
even
to
interfere
seriously
with
either
its
shape
or
the
position
in
the
living
room
from
which
it
sheds
its
genial
warmth
and
cheerfulness
around
the
family
circle
a
recognition
of
this
ineradicable
popular
feeling
was
involved
in
the
adoption
of
the
grate
filled
with
glowing
balls
of
asbestos
composition
by
the
makers
of
apparatus
the
imitation
of
the
grate
is
in
some
cases
almost
perfect
and
yet
it
is
in
this
close
approximation
to
the
real
article
that
some
lovers
of
the
domestic
find
their
chief
objection
just
as
the
tricks
of
anthropoid
animals
so
strongly
reminiscent
of
human
beings
and
yet
distinct
have
the
effect
of
repelling
some
people
far
more
than
the
ways
of
creatures
utterly
unlike
man
in
form
and
feature
taking
count
of
the
domestic
attachment
to
a
real
fireplace
or
grate
as
one
of
the
principal
factors
in
the
problem
of
domestic
heating
it
is
plain
that
one
way
of
obviating
the
waste
of
heat
which
is
at
present
incurred
without
doing
violence
to
that
sentiment
is
by
making
better
use
of
the
chimney
the
pipes
and
coils
which
are
already
so
largely
used
for
indoor
heating
offer
in
themselves
a
hint
in
this
direction
long
pipes
or
coils
inserted
in
the
course
taken
by
the
heated
air
in
ascending
a
chimney
become
warm
and
it
is
possible
by
taking
such
a
pipe
from
one
part
of
the
room
up
the
passage
and
back
again
to
cause
by
means
of
a
small
rotating
fan
or
other
ventilating
apparatus
the
whole
of
the
air
in
the
chamber
to
circulate
up
the
chimney
and
back
again
every
few
minutes
gathering
warmth
as
it
goes
in
this
way
and
by
exposing
as
much
heating
surface
to
the
warm
air
in
the
chimney
as
possible
the
warmth
derived
by
an
ordinary
room
from
a
fuel
fire
can
be
more
than
doubled
at
the
same
time
the
risk
of
spreading
smuts
over
the
room
can
be
entirely
avoided
first
by
keeping
the
whole
length
of
pipe
perfectly
and
attaching
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
readily
removed
for
inspection
and
secondly
by
placing
the
outward
vent
in
such
a
position
that
the
gentle
current
must
mount
upwards
and
any
dust
must
fall
back
again
into
a
wide
orifice
and
by
covering
the
latter
with
fine
wire
gauze
an
apparatus
of
this
kind
acts
as
a
remover
of
dust
from
the
room
instead
of
adding
any
to
it
one
necessity
however
is
the
provision
of
motive
power
very
small
though
it
be
to
work
the
fan
or
otherwise
promote
a
draught
electric
heating
is
however
the
method
which
will
probably
take
precedence
over
others
in
all
those
cases
where
systems
are
tried
on
their
actual
merits
apart
from
sentiment
or
usage
the
wonderful
facility
afforded
by
the
electric
heating
wire
for
the
distribution
of
a
moderate
degree
of
warmth
in
exactly
the
proportions
in
which
it
may
be
needed
gives
the
electric
method
an
enormous
advantage
over
its
rivals
the
fundamental
principle
upon
which
heating
by
electricity
is
generally
arranged
depends
upon
the
fact
that
a
thin
wire
offers
more
electrical
resistance
to
the
passage
of
a
current
than
a
thick
one
and
therefore
becomes
heated
in
the
case
of
the
incandescent
lamp
in
which
the
carbon
filament
requires
to
be
raised
to
a
white
heat
and
must
be
free
to
emit
its
light
without
interference
from
opaque
matter
it
is
necessary
to
protect
the
resisting
and
glowing
material
by
nearly
exhausting
the
air
from
the
hermetically
sealed
globe
or
bulb
in
which
it
is
enclosed
but
in
electrical
for
which
a
white
heat
is
not
required
and
in
which
the
necessary
protection
from
the
air
can
be
secured
by
embedding
the
conveying
medium
in
opaque
solid
material
the
problem
becomes
much
simpler
because
strong
metallic
wires
can
be
used
and
they
may
be
enclosed
in
any
kind
of
cement
which
does
not
corrode
them
and
which
distributes
the
heat
while
refusing
to
conduct
the
electric
current
a
network
of
wire
crossing
and
recrossing
but
always
carrying
the
same
current
may
be
embedded
in
plaster
and
a
gentle
heat
may
be
imparted
to
the
whole
mass
through
the
resistance
of
the
wires
to
the
electricity
and
their
contact
with
the
material
concurrently
with
this
method
of
heating
there
is
gradually
being
introduced
a
practice
of
using
metallic
lathing
for
the
plastering
of
in
place
of
the
old
wooden
battens
generally
employed
for
work
the
solution
of
the
practical
problem
which
has
to
be
faced
seems
to
depend
upon
the
prospect
of
effecting
a
compromise
between
the
two
systems
introducing
thin
resisting
wire
as
the
metallic
element
in
such
work
but
making
all
other
components
from
material
in
the
event
of
any
or
occurring
through
accidental
injury
to
the
wall
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
to
be
compelled
to
knock
away
the
plaster
moreover
it
is
not
necessary
for
ordinary
warming
purposes
that
the
whole
of
the
wall
up
to
the
ceiling
should
be
heated
accordingly
the
system
which
is
likely
to
commend
itself
is
that
of
constructing
panels
on
some
such
principle
as
the
one
already
described
and
affixing
them
to
the
wall
forming
a
kind
of
solid
dado
from
three
to
four
feet
from
the
floor
these
can
be
fastened
so
as
to
facilitate
removal
for
examination
and
repairs
when
the
current
is
switched
on
they
are
slowly
warmed
up
by
the
heat
generated
through
the
resistance
of
the
wires
and
the
air
in
the
room
is
gently
heated
without
being
vitiated
or
deprived
of
its
oxygen
as
it
is
by
the
presence
of
flames
whether
of
fuel
or
of
gas
warming
footstools
will
also
be
provided
and
a
room
heated
in
this
way
will
be
found
eminently
comfortable
to
live
in
this
method
of
having
once
obtained
a
decided
lead
within
the
cities
and
other
localities
where
a
cheap
electric
current
is
available
somewhat
similar
systems
adapted
for
the
heating
of
walls
by
hot
air
in
tubes
instead
of
by
resistant
wires
will
be
largely
adopted
in
the
rural
districts
more
particularly
in
churches
and
other
places
of
public
assemblage
the
progress
made
in
this
direction
during
the
last
few
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
already
noteworthy
but
when
really
gets
a
good
chance
to
force
the
pace
of
improvement
the
day
will
soon
arrive
when
it
will
be
regarded
as
nothing
less
than
barbarous
to
ask
people
to
sit
during
the
winter
months
in
places
not
evenly
warmed
all
through
by
methods
which
result
in
the
distribution
of
the
heat
exactly
as
it
is
wanted
ventilation
is
another
household
reform
which
will
be
very
greatly
accelerated
by
the
presence
of
electric
power
of
low
cost
the
great
majority
of
civilised
people
as
yet
have
no
idea
of
ventilation
excepting
that
highly
unreasonable
kind
which
depends
upon
leaving
their
houses
and
other
buildings
partly
open
to
the
outside
weather
one
man
is
sitting
in
church
under
a
down
draught
from
an
open
window
above
him
while
others
in
different
parts
of
the
same
building
may
be
weltering
in
the
heat
and
feeling
stifled
through
the
vitiated
air
in
the
great
majority
of
living
rooms
really
have
no
other
effective
form
of
ventilation
than
the
draught
from
the
fireplace
the
strength
of
this
draught
again
is
regulated
to
a
very
large
extent
by
the
speed
and
direction
of
the
outside
wind
in
calm
and
sultry
weather
when
ventilation
is
most
needed
the
current
of
air
from
the
fireplace
may
be
very
slight
indeed
while
in
the
wild
and
boisterous
days
succeeding
a
sudden
change
of
weather
the
living
rooms
are
subjected
to
such
a
drop
in
temperature
and
are
swept
by
such
draughts
of
cold
air
that
the
inmates
are
very
liable
to
catch
colds
and
influenza
hence
has
arisen
in
the
british
islands
and
in
the
colder
countries
of
europe
and
america
the
very
general
desire
among
the
poorer
classes
to
suppress
all
ventilation
rooms
are
closed
at
the
commencement
of
winter
and
practically
remain
so
until
the
summer
season
many
people
whose
circumstances
have
improved
and
who
pass
suddenly
from
houses
to
those
which
have
better
access
to
the
outside
air
find
the
change
so
severe
upon
their
constitutions
and
habits
that
they
give
a
bad
name
to
everything
in
the
shape
of
ventilation
meanwhile
the
dread
of
draughts
causes
people
to
exclude
the
fresh
air
to
such
an
extent
that
consumption
and
many
other
diseases
are
fostered
and
engendered
all
this
arises
mainly
from
the
very
serious
mistake
of
imagining
that
it
is
possible
to
move
air
without
the
exercise
of
force
in
the
case
of
the
draught
caused
by
a
fire
no
doubt
an
active
force
is
employed
in
the
energy
of
the
heated
air
ascending
the
chimney
and
in
the
corresponding
inrush
this
latter
is
usually
drawn
from
below
the
door
the
very
worst
place
from
which
it
can
be
taken
seeing
that
in
the
experience
of
most
people
it
is
by
getting
the
feet
chilled
through
draughts
along
the
floor
that
the
worst
colds
are
generally
contracted
fireplaces
are
not
unusually
regarded
as
a
direct
means
for
ventilation
and
with
regard
to
nearly
all
the
devices
commonly
adopted
in
houses
and
public
buildings
it
may
be
said
that
they
lack
the
first
requisite
for
a
scientific
system
of
renewing
the
air
namely
a
source
of
power
by
means
of
which
to
shift
it
from
outside
to
inside
and
there
is
no
direction
in
which
a
more
pressing
need
exists
for
the
distribution
of
power
in
small
quantities
than
in
regard
to
the
ventilation
of
private
and
public
edifices
the
circular
fan
placed
in
the
centre
piece
of
the
ceiling
and
controlled
by
an
electric
switch
on
the
wall
is
the
principal
type
of
apparatus
applicable
to
the
purposes
of
ventilation
as
electric
lighting
of
becomes
more
common
and
ultimately
almost
universal
within
cities
the
practice
will
be
to
arrange
for
lighting
and
for
ventilation
at
the
same
time
but
unfortunately
the
current
now
principally
employed
for
electric
lighting
and
consisting
of
a
series
of
impulses
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
the
opposite
alternating
with
wonderful
rapidity
is
not
well
adapted
for
driving
small
motors
of
the
types
now
in
use
one
improvement
in
domestic
economy
greatly
needed
in
the
twentieth
century
consists
in
the
invention
of
a
really
effective
simple
and
economical
motor
this
is
a
matter
which
will
be
referred
to
in
dealing
with
electrical
machines
that
the
problem
will
be
solved
before
many
years
have
passed
there
is
no
good
reason
to
doubt
in
the
meantime
many
laudable
endeavours
are
being
made
towards
the
application
of
the
pressure
from
water
pipes
to
the
purpose
of
driving
ventilating
fans
the
extreme
wastefulness
of
power
and
of
water
involved
in
this
method
of
dealing
with
the
difficulty
may
be
partially
overlooked
on
account
of
the
very
small
amounts
required
to
produce
an
effect
in
the
desired
direction
and
yet
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
recognition
of
the
wastefulness
acts
to
some
extent
as
a
deterrent
to
artificial
ventilation
the
benefits
of
the
system
are
not
sufficiently
obvious
or
showy
to
induce
any
class
of
people
excepting
physicians
and
persons
fully
acquainted
with
the
principles
of
hygiene
to
sanction
a
material
outlay
upon
the
object
when
an
exactly
suitable
motor
has
been
invented
the
standard
electric
light
installation
will
be
practically
one
apparatus
with
the
ventilating
fan
and
the
cost
of
the
latter
will
hardly
be
felt
as
a
separate
item
in
cooking
there
is
in
existing
ordinary
methods
the
same
enormous
waste
of
heat
as
there
is
in
the
warming
of
rooms
something
no
doubt
has
been
done
in
the
direction
of
economy
by
the
invention
of
new
and
improved
forms
of
stoves
but
a
great
preponderance
of
the
heat
generated
in
the
fire
of
even
the
best
stove
goes
up
the
chimney
the
electric
oven
as
already
invented
is
perhaps
the
nearest
approach
to
a
really
economical
cooker
that
has
yet
been
proposed
but
even
before
the
general
adoption
of
such
an
apparatus
there
will
be
ample
room
for
improvement
in
the
cooking
stove
first
as
regards
insulation
and
secondly
in
the
distribution
of
the
fuel
around
the
objects
to
be
heated
one
principal
cause
of
the
waste
that
goes
on
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
fire
burns
away
from
the
place
at
which
its
heat
is
most
beneficially
applied
and
no
means
are
adopted
as
in
the
case
of
the
candle
in
a
carriage
lamp
for
keeping
it
up
to
the
required
level
additions
of
fuel
are
made
from
the
top
with
the
immediate
effect
of
checking
the
heat
a
great
advance
in
economy
of
fuel
will
take
place
when
the
household
coal
intended
for
cooking
purposes
is
ground
up
together
with
the
proper
proportions
of
certain
waste
products
of
chemistry
so
as
to
make
a
smouldering
mixture
which
can
be
kept
regularly
supplied
to
a
shallow
or
thin
fire
box
by
pressure
applied
from
beneath
or
at
the
parts
farthest
away
from
the
objects
to
be
heated
an
oven
for
instance
may
be
surrounded
by
a
jacket
filled
with
ground
smouldering
mixture
having
a
insulator
outside
and
a
connection
with
a
chimney
the
heat
from
the
fuel
is
thus
kept
in
close
proximity
to
the
objects
requiring
to
be
cooked
and
comparatively
small
waste
results
it
is
by
taking
advantage
of
their
superior
facilities
in
the
same
direction
that
gas
and
inflammable
oils
have
already
made
their
mark
in
the
sphere
of
domestic
cookery
regarded
as
fuel
their
initial
cost
may
be
relatively
heavy
and
yet
owing
to
their
more
exact
method
of
application
they
often
effect
a
saving
in
the
end
not
only
do
they
bring
the
fire
closer
to
the
articles
to
be
heated
or
cooked
but
they
also
make
it
easy
for
the
fire
to
be
turned
off
or
on
and
this
in
itself
is
an
important
source
of
economy
still
with
the
advent
of
cheaper
and
more
accessible
power
in
every
centre
of
population
the
cost
of
grinding
coal
and
of
mixing
it
in
order
to
form
a
fuel
comparable
in
respect
of
convenience
and
economy
with
gas
and
oil
will
be
so
greatly
reduced
that
the
black
diamond
will
still
continue
to
challenge
its
rivals
in
the
arena
of
competition
presented
by
the
demands
of
domestic
economy
light
as
well
as
heat
and
air
requires
to
be
evenly
and
equably
distributed
throughout
the
before
anything
approaching
an
ideal
residence
can
be
secured
as
the
science
of
hygiene
advances
it
is
demonstrated
more
and
more
clearly
that
sunlight
and
even
diffused
daylight
may
be
used
as
a
most
effective
weapon
against
the
spread
of
disease
alternations
of
deep
gloom
in
the
with
the
superior
light
resulting
from
brighter
weather
produce
many
kinds
of
nervous
derangement
not
the
least
deleterious
of
which
arise
from
the
unnecessary
strain
to
which
the
eyesight
is
subjected
the
promise
of
the
future
is
that
through
the
abundance
of
windows
provided
in
the
walls
roofs
and
porches
of
our
but
all
supplemented
with
shutters
and
blinds
of
various
kinds
there
shall
be
a
possibility
of
regulating
far
more
accurately
than
at
present
the
accessibility
of
light
from
outside
according
to
the
brightness
or
dulness
of
the
day
it
is
hardly
to
be
expected
that
many
people
will
build
crystal
palaces
in
which
to
reside
but
with
the
immense
progress
that
is
being
made
in
the
construction
of
dwellings
with
iron
or
steel
frames
and
in
the
adaptation
of
various
materials
so
that
they
may
serve
for
building
purposes
in
conjunction
with
metallic
frameworks
it
seems
clear
that
many
roofs
as
well
as
large
portions
of
walls
will
in
future
be
made
on
the
composite
principle
using
steel
and
glass
these
will
to
a
large
extent
be
permanently
sheltered
from
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
when
high
in
the
heavens
by
shutters
constructed
on
the
louvre
principle
so
that
they
may
admit
the
light
from
the
sky
continually
but
actual
rays
or
beams
of
sunlight
only
for
a
short
time
after
sunrise
and
at
the
close
of
day
the
ceilings
if
any
are
provided
under
the
roofs
will
also
be
glazed
the
obstacles
presented
in
the
way
of
such
a
reform
in
a
city
like
london
may
at
first
sight
seem
so
serious
as
to
be
practically
insuperable
long
rows
of
three
or
four
storied
houses
certainly
offer
but
few
facilities
for
the
admission
of
light
through
the
roofs
of
any
but
the
rooms
on
the
top
floors
and
yet
it
is
in
the
of
this
type
that
the
depression
caused
by
gloom
and
the
absence
of
light
during
the
hours
of
day
are
most
severely
felt
as
a
source
of
nervous
depression
evolution
in
a
matter
of
this
sort
will
take
place
gradually
and
along
the
line
of
least
resistance
portions
of
courts
areas
and
yards
will
be
glazed
over
in
the
way
described
and
it
will
be
found
that
those
rooms
which
are
thus
enclosed
and
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
rain
but
left
open
to
the
daylight
constitute
the
most
cheerful
sitting
places
in
the
houses
then
as
rebuilding
and
alterations
proceed
many
houses
will
gradually
be
remodelled
at
least
as
regards
some
of
their
rooms
in
the
same
direction
physicians
will
become
increasingly
insistent
on
the
necessity
for
admitting
plenty
of
light
into
the
abodes
of
the
sick
more
particularly
of
families
inclined
towards
consumption
a
very
large
trade
will
spring
up
during
the
twentieth
century
in
household
cooling
apparatus
for
use
in
hot
climates
the
colonial
expansion
towards
which
all
european
races
are
now
tending
inevitably
means
that
very
many
thousands
of
persons
whose
ancestors
have
been
accustomed
to
life
in
cold
or
temperate
climates
will
be
induced
to
dwell
in
the
dry
and
warm
or
in
the
humid
tropical
regions
of
the
earth
it
will
be
an
important
task
of
the
british
continental
and
american
machinists
of
the
twentieth
century
to
turn
out
convenient
pieces
of
apparatus
which
shall
be
available
for
ventilating
houses
especially
during
the
night
and
for
reducing
the
temperature
in
them
to
something
approaching
that
which
is
natural
to
the
inmates
the
old
clumsy
punkah
will
be
replaced
by
circular
fans
keeping
up
a
gentle
current
of
air
with
a
minimum
of
noise
or
annoyance
of
any
kind
at
present
it
is
only
in
specially
favoured
circumstances
that
these
circular
punkahs
can
be
actuated
by
mechanical
force
that
is
to
say
where
a
prime
motor
or
an
electric
current
or
a
reticulated
water
supply
for
driving
a
suitable
machine
may
be
at
hand
in
other
situations
the
use
of
compressed
air
or
gas
may
be
resorted
to
and
for
this
purpose
small
capsules
similar
to
those
already
introduced
for
making
soda
water
by
the
liberation
of
compressed
carbonic
acid
gas
will
be
found
handy
for
a
very
small
sum
of
money
the
householder
will
be
able
to
purchase
a
sufficient
number
of
capsules
to
ensure
motive
power
for
his
fan
during
a
week
of
hot
nights
a
convenient
form
of
small
motor
suitable
for
being
driven
by
compressed
air
or
gases
in
this
way
is
one
in
which
a
diminutive
turbine
or
other
wheel
is
set
at
the
bottom
of
a
thin
tube
of
mercury
the
capsule
being
fastened
to
the
lower
end
of
this
apparatus
liberates
at
very
short
intervals
of
time
bubbles
of
air
or
gas
which
in
the
upward
ascent
drive
the
wheel
the
arrangement
depends
upon
the
fact
that
a
stream
of
gas
ascending
in
a
heavy
liquid
behaves
in
the
same
way
as
a
stream
of
water
descending
by
its
own
weight
and
turning
a
it
supplies
what
is
perhaps
the
simplest
and
most
inexpensive
small
motor
available
for
the
lightest
domestic
work
to
which
a
gentle
but
continuous
source
of
power
is
applicable
for
actually
cooling
the
air
as
well
as
keeping
it
in
motion
similar
devices
will
be
resorted
to
with
the
addition
of
the
circulation
of
the
current
of
air
through
coils
of
pipes
laid
under
the
surface
of
the
ground
in
this
way
householders
will
have
all
the
advantages
of
living
in
cool
underground
rooms
without
incurring
the
discomforts
and
dangers
which
are
often
inseparable
from
that
mode
of
life
in
the
coastal
regions
which
usually
have
the
most
trying
climates
for
europeans
living
in
tropical
countries
a
method
of
cooling
the
houses
will
be
based
on
the
fact
that
at
moderate
depths
in
the
sea
the
prevailing
temperature
is
a
steady
one
not
much
above
the
freezing
point
of
water
almost
every
seaport
town
within
the
tropics
where
white
residents
in
their
houses
swelter
nightly
in
the
greatest
discomfort
from
the
heat
is
in
close
proximity
to
deep
ocean
water
in
which
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
the
regular
temperature
is
only
about
degrees
fahr
the
cost
of
steel
piping
strong
enough
to
withstand
the
pressure
of
the
water
in
places
which
possess
absolutely
the
coolest
temperature
of
the
ocean
would
be
very
heavy
but
on
the
other
hand
the
actual
reduction
of
heat
demanded
for
the
satisfactory
cooling
of
the
air
in
a
is
not
by
any
means
great
and
at
quite
shallow
depths
the
heat
of
the
air
can
be
satisfactorily
abstracted
by
the
sea
water
surrounding
coils
of
pipes
even
in
colder
climates
it
seems
likely
that
similar
systems
will
be
found
useful
in
producing
a
preliminary
reduction
in
the
temperature
of
the
air
employed
in
keeping
fresh
foodstuffs
such
as
meat
fruits
and
vegetables
fruits
especially
when
placed
in
suitable
receptacles
and
stored
at
temperatures
quite
steady
at
about
the
freezing
point
of
water
will
not
only
be
readily
kept
on
land
from
one
season
to
another
but
will
be
transported
to
markets
thousands
of
miles
distant
from
the
growers
and
sold
in
practically
the
same
condition
as
if
they
had
just
been
picked
from
the
trees
during
the
twentieth
century
the
proportion
of
the
fruit
eaters
among
the
peoples
of
the
great
manufacturing
countries
will
be
very
largely
augmented
and
this
result
will
be
brought
about
mainly
through
the
instrumentality
of
methods
of
keeping
perishable
produce
free
from
deterioration
by
maintaining
it
almost
at
the
freezing
point
a
temperature
at
which
under
suitable
conditions
as
regards
exclusion
of
moisture
and
steadiness
of
hygrometric
pressure
the
germs
of
decay
in
food
are
practically
prevented
from
coming
to
maturity

distant
from

sea
various
systems
depending
upon
the
supply
of
dry
cold
air
from
central
stations
through
pipes
to
the
dwellings
of
subscribers
will
no
doubt
be
brought
into
operation
this
however
will
only
be
practicable
in
the
more
populous
localities
having
plenty
of
residents
ready
to
contribute
to
the
expense
for
more
isolated
houses
the
cooling
and
ventilating
apparatus
of
the
future
may
be
a
modification
of
the
which
has
been
successfully
adapted
to
metallurgical
purposes
when
downward
jets
of
water
as
in
a
are
enclosed
in
a
large
pipe
connected
horizontally
with
a
room
but
having
facilities
for
the
escape
of
the
water
underneath
a
strong
draught
of
cool
air
is
created
and
the
prevailing
temperature
is
quickly
reduced
an
apparatus
of
this
kind
may
be
intended
for
application
either
to
the
ventilators
or
to
the
windows
of
rooms
lifts
for
conveying
persons
from
one
storey
of
a
building
to
another
will
probably
undergo
a
considerable
amount
of
modification
during
the
next
few
years
the
establishment
of
central
electric
stations
and
the
distribution
of
electricity
for
lighting
and
for
power
will
offer
a
very
great
premium
upon
the
preference
for
electric
motors
for
lifts
as
soon
as
a
maximum
of
efficiency
combined
with
the
minimum
of
cost
has
been
attained
there
will
be
a
demand
for
the
introduction
of
lifts
in
positions
where
the
traffic
is
not
large
enough
to
warrant
the
constant
presence
of
an
attendant
in
fact
the
desire
will
be
for
some
kind
of
elevator
which
shall
be
just
as
free
to
the
use
of
each
individual
as
is
the
staircase
of
an
ordinary
house
for
this
purpose
inclined
planes
having
moving
canvas
or
similar
ramps
will
be
extensively
brought
into
use
the
passenger
steps
upon
what
is
practically
an
endless
belt
having
suitable
slats
upon
it
to
prevent
his
foot
from
slipping
and
as
the
at
the
side
of
this
moves
concurrently
he
is
taken
up
without
any
effort
to
the
landing
on
which
he
may
alight
quite
steadily
when
this
idea
which
has
already
been
brought
into
operation
has
been
more
fully
developed
it
will
be
seen
that
a
large
circular
disc
set
at
an
angle
and
properly
furnished
will
supply
a
more
convenient
form
of
free
elevator
one
side
will
be
used
by
those
who
are
going
up
and
the
other
by
those
who
wish
to
come
down
the
well
of
the
staircase
for
such
a
lift
is
made
in
elliptical
form
like
the
shadow
projection
of
a
circle
steps
can
be
provided
so
that
when
not
in
motion
the
lift
will
be
a
staircase
not
differing
much
from
the
old
style

the
telegraphic
wire
in
the
home
and

will
fulfil
a
very
important
part
in
the
economy
of
the
twentieth
century
for
conveying
intelligence
as
well
as
for
heating
cooking
and
lighting
the
electric
current
will
become
one
of
the
most
familiar
of
all
the
forces
called
in
to
assist
in
domestic
arrangements
the
rapidity
with
which
the
electric
has
taken
the
place
of
the
knocker
and
the
system
affords
one
indication
of
the
readiness
with
which
those
forms
of
electric
apparatus
which
are
adapted
to
all
the
purposes
of
communicating
and
reminding
will
recommend
themselves
to
the
public
during
the
twentieth
century
in
another
direction
the
eagerness
with
which
every
advance
in
the
telephone
is
hailed
by
the
people
may
well
offer
an
augury
of
rapid
progress
in
the
immediate
future
in
this
department
invention
will
aim
just
as
much
at
simplification
as
at
elaboration
and
some
of
the
pieces
of
domestic
electrical
apparatus
universally
used
during
the
twentieth
century
will
be
astonishingly
cheap
the
call
to
awake
in
the
morning
will
in
cities
and
towns
be
made
by
wireless
telegraphy
which
will
also
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
domestic
clocks
so
that
if
desired
any
suitable
form
of
clock
alarm
may
be
used
with
the
most
perfect
confidence
a
tentative
system
of
this
kind
has
been
adopted
in
connection
with
certain
telephone
exchanges
in
which
special
officers
are
told
off
whose
duty
it
is
to
call
those
subscribers
who
have
paid
the
small
fee
covering
the
expense
these
officers
are
required
to
time
their
intimations
according
to
the
previously
expressed
wishes
of
subscribers
this
kind
of
service
as
well
as
the
regulation
of
the
household
clock
is
eminently
a
department
of
domestic
economy
in
which
wireless
telegraphy
will
prove
itself
useful
because
it
does
not
demand
that
a
subscriber
shall
have
gone
to
the
expense
of
installing
a
wire
to
his
house
and
of
paying
a
rent
or
fee
for
the
use
of
one
the
clock
controlled
by
wireless
telegraphy
will
doubtless
undergo
a
rapid
development
from
the
time
when
it
is
first
introduced
practically
the
same
principles
which
enable
the
electrician
to
utilise
the
hertzian
waves
or
ether
vibrations
for
the
purpose
of
setting
a
clock
right
once
a
day
or
once
an
hour
will
permit
of
an
impulse
true
to
time
being
sent
from
the
central
station
every
second
or
every
minute
and
when
this
has
been
accomplished
it
will
be
seen
that
there
is
no
more
use
for
the
maintenance
of
elaborate
clockworks
at
any
place
excepting
the
central
station
the
domestic
clock
will
in
fact
become
mainly
a
receiver
for
the
wireless
telegraphic
apparatus
and
its
internal
mechanism
will
be
reduced
perhaps
to
a
couple
of
wheels
which
are
necessary
to
transmit
the
motion
of
a
to
that
which
indicates
the
hours
the
of
the
future
must
be
very
simple
and
inexpensive
in
order
to
ensure
its
introduction
not
only
into
offices
and
warehouses
but
also
into
shops
and
houses
the
companies
will
very
shortly
awake
to
the
fact
that
prompt
telegraphic
alarm
in
case
of
fire
is
worth
far
more
than
the
majority
of
the
prohibitions
upon
which
they
are
accustomed
to
insist
by
way
of
rendering
fires
less
likely
the
main
principles
upon
which
the
electric
will
be
operated
have
already
been
worked
out
and
partially
adopted
in
the
system
of
fuses
and
used
in
connection
with
electric
lighting
the
methods
of
preventing
fire
due
to
the
development
of
excessive
heat
have
been
well
studied
but
simplification
is
particularly
required
in
the
case
of
those
which
are
to
be
useful
for
giving
intimation
of
a
conflagration
from
any
cause
arising
as
the
telegraphic
and
telephonic
wires
are
extended
so
as
to
traverse
practically
all
the
streets
of
every
city
the
companies
will
find
it
to
their
advantage
to
promote
a
simple
plan
depending
on
the
use
of
a
combustible
thread
passing
round
little
pulleys
in
the
corners
of
all
the
rooms
and
finally
out
to
the
front
where
an
electrical
is
fixed
so
that
on
the
thread
being
burnt
and
broken
at
any
point
in
its
circuit
an
electric
message
will
be
at
once
sent
along
the
nearest
wire
to
the
station
and
a
bell
set
ringing
both
inside
and
outside
the
premises
somewhat
similar
systems
will
be
used
for
checking
the
enterprises
of
the
burglar
the
best
protected
safes
of
the
future
will
be
enmeshed
in
networks
of
wires
encased
in
some
material
which
will
render
it
impossible
to
determine
their
positions
from
the
outside
these
wires
will
be
so
related
to
an
electric
circuit
that
the
breaking
of
any
one
of
them
at
any
part
of
its
course
will
have
the
effect
of
ringing
a
bell
and
giving
warning
at
the
police
station
as
well
as
at
other
places
where
potential
may
be
on
hand
for
doors
and
windows
very
simple
contact
devices
have
already
been
brought
out
but
the
principal
objection
to
their
general
adoption
arises
from
the
fact
that
so
very
many
houses
remain
unconnected
with
any
telephone
system
which
may
be
made
available
for
calling
the
police
even
were
all
houses
connected
it
is
true
that
in
some
instances
attempts
might
be
made
to
cut
the
wires
when
a
raid
was
in
contemplation
but
the
risk
of
discovery
in
any
such
operation
would
prove
a
very
powerful
deterrent
in
fact
the
telephone
wire
more
than
any
other
mechanical
device
is
destined
to
aid
in
improving
the
burglar
out
of
existence
with
the
indefinite
multiplication
of
telephone
subscribers
at
very
cheap
rates
there
will
come
a
powerful
inducement
towards
the
invention
of
new
appliances
for
rendering
the
subscriber
independent
of
the
attention
of
officers
at
any
central
exchange
the
duty
of
connecting
an
individual
subscriber
with
any
other
with
whom
he
may
desire
to
converse
is
after
all
a
purely
mechanical
one
and
eminently
of
a
kind
which
by
a
combination
of
engineering
and
electrical
skill
may
be
quite
successfully
accomplished
in
the
apparatus
which
will
probably
be
in
use
during
the
twentieth
century
each
subscriber
will
have
a
dial
carrying
on
its
face
the
names
and
numbers
of
all
those
with
whom
he
is
in
the
habit
of
holding
communication
this
will
be
his
smaller
dial
and
beside
it
will
be
another
intended
for
only
occasional
use
through
which
by
exercising
a
little
more
patience
he
may
connect
himself
with
any
other
subscriber
whatever
corresponding
dials
will
be
fixed
in
the
central
office
under
this
system
when
the
subscriber
desires
to
secure
a
connection
he
moves
a
handle
round
his
dial
until
the
pointer
in
its
circuit
comes
to
the
desired
number
an
electrical
impulse
is
thus
sent
along
the
wire
to
the
central
station
for
every
number
over
which
the
pointer
passes
and
the
corresponding
pointer
or
at
the
central
station
is
moved
exactly
in
sympathy
when
the
correct
number
is
reached
the
subscriber
is
in
connection
with
the
person
with
whom
he
desires
to
converse
if
however
the
latter
should
be
already
engaged
a
return
impulse
causes
the
bell
of
the
first
subscriber
to
ring
of
course
the
prime
cost
of
installing
such
a
system
as
this
will
be
greater
than
in
the
case
of
the
simple
telephones
but
the
two
systems
can
be
used
conjointly
and
the
immense
convenience
especially
to
large
firms
of
being
able
to
go
straight
to
the
parties
with
whom
they
wish
to
communicate
will
induce
many
of
them
to
adopt
the
automatic
apparatus
as
soon
as
it
has
been
perfected
wireless
telephony
must
come
to
the
front
in
the
near
future
but
at
first
for
only
very
special
purposes
the
prospect
of
the
profits
that
would
be
attendant
on
working
up
a
business
unhampered
by
the
heavy
capital
charges
which
weigh
upon
the
owners
of
telephone
wires
must
stimulate
inventive
enterprise
to
a
remarkable
degree
in
this
particular
line
the
main
difficulty
however
in
the
application
of
the
system
to
general
purposes
will
lie
in
the
need
for
an
ingenious
but
simple
means
for
enabling
one
subscriber
to
call
another
for
this
purpose
probably
the
synchronised
clock
system
already
referred
to
will
be
found
essential
each
office
or
house
being
furnished
with
a
timekeeper
of
this
type
kept
in
constant
agreement
with
a
central
clock
and
so
arranged
that
only
when
the
ethereal
electrical
impulse
is
given
at
a
certain
fixed
point
in
the
minute
will
any
particular
subscriber
bell
be
rung
this
may
be
effected
by
some
such
arrangement
as
a
revolving
drum
perforated
at
a
different
part
of
its
periphery
for
each
individual
subscriber
and
capable
of
permitting
the
electrical
contact
which
makes
a
magnet
and
rings
the
bell
only
at
the
fraction
of
a
moment
when
the
slot
passes
the
pointer
this
will
mean
of
course
that
only
at
a
certain
almost
infinitesimally
small
space
of
time
in
the
duration
of
each
minute
will
it
be
possible
to
call
any
particular
subscriber
or
rather
to
release
the
mechanism
which
will
set
his
bell
ringing
for
perhaps
a
minute
at
a
time
in
the
presence
of
unscrupulous
competition
resulting
in
the
flinging
out
of
hertzian
wave
vibrations
promiscuously
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
a
rival
chances
of
obtaining
satisfactory
connections
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
rather
more
complicated
arrangements
of
a
nature
analogous
to
those
of
the
puzzle
lock
instead
of
one
impulse
during
the
minute
two
or
three
would
be
required
in
order
to
release
the
mechanism
for
ringing
any
subscriber
bell
and
no
ring
would
take
place
unless
the
between
these
impulses
were
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
agreed
form
which
might
be
varied
at
convenient
intervals
yet
in
the
cases
in
which
wireless
telephony
and
telegraphy
are
taken
up
by
local
public
authorities
having
power
to
forbid
any
one
playing
dog
in
the
manger
by
preventing
useful
work
by
others
while
failing
to
promote
it
himself
the
simpler
system
of
wireless
telephone
call
will
be
practicable
with
the
advance
of
municipalisation
and
of
intelligent
collectivism
generally
enterprises
of
public
utility
will
be
guarded
from
mere
commercial
hostility
much
more
sedulously
in
the
twentieth
century
than
they
have
been
in
the
past
a
great
multitude
of
new
applications
of
the
telegraphic
and
telephonic
systems
will
be
introduced
in
the
immediate
future
not
only
will
those
subscribers
who
are
connected
by
wire
with
central
stations
have
the
advantage
of
being
called
at
any
hour
in
the
morning
according
to
their
intimated
wishes
but
such
services
as
lighting
the
fires
in
winter
mornings
so
that
rooms
may
be
fairly
warmed
before
they
are
entered
will
be
performed
by
electric
messages
sent
from
a
central
station
drawings
will
also
be
despatched
by
telegraph
for
such
purposes
as
the
transmission
of
sketches
from
the
scene
of
any
stirring
event
the
first
really
practical
application
of
drawing
by
telegraph
will
probably
depend
upon
the
use
of
a
large
number
of
code
words
divided
into
two
groups
each
of
which
on
the
principles
of
geometry
will
indicate
a
different
degree
of
distance
from
the
base
line
and
from
the
side
line
respectively
so
that
from
any
sketch
a
correct
message
in
code
may
be
made
up
and
the
drawing
may
be
reconstructed
at
the
receiving
end
illustrated
newspapers
will
in
this
way
obtain
drawings
exactly
at
the
same
time
as
their
other
messages
and
distant
occurrences
will
be
brought
before
the
public
eye
much
more
vividly
and
more
correctly
than
has
ever
hitherto
been
practicable
for
special
objects
also
photographs
can
be
sent
by
telegraph
through
the
use
of
the
in
plaster
of
paris
or
other
suitable
material
which
travels
backwards
and
forwards
underneath
a
pointer
the
rising
and
falling
of
which
is
accurately
represented
by
thick
and
thin
lines
or
by
the
darker
and
lighter
photographic
printing
of
a
beam
of
light
of
varying
intensity
at
the
other
end
so
that
a
shaded
reproduction
of
the
photograph
is
produced
relief
at
the
sending
end
is
in
this
way
translated
into
darkness
of
shade
at
the
receiving
end
any
general
expansion
of
this
system
if
it
comes
will
necessarily
be
postponed
till
long
after
the
full
possibilities
of
the
codeword
plan
have
been
exploited
because
the
latter
works
in
exactly
with
the
ordinary
methods
for
sending
telegraphic
matter
the
keen
competition
between
submarine
and
wireless
telegraphy
will
be
one
of
the
most
exciting
contests
furnished
by
electrical
progress
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
new
century
attention
will
be
devoted
to
those
directions
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
in
which
it
is
possible
to
send
messages
almost
entirely
by
land
lines
and
to
bridge
over
comparatively
small
intervals
of
space
from
land
to
land
by
wireless
telegraphy
thus
the
asiatic
and
canadian
route
may
be
expected
shortly
to
enter
into
competition
with
the
atlantic
cables
in
telegraphic
business
to
the
united
states
while
australia
will
be
reached
singapore
and
java
a
great
impetus
will
be
given
to
the
wireless
system
as
a
commercial
undertaking
when
arrangements
have
been
perfected
for
causing
the
receiver
at
any
particular
station
to
translate
its
message
into
a
form
suitable
for
sending
automatically
when
this
has
been
done
many
of
the
wayside
stations
will
be
almost
entirely
and
messages
indeed
may
be
despatched
from
island
to
island
or
from
one
floating
station
to
another
across
the
atlantic
itself
another
requirement
for
really
cheap
telegraphy
on
the
new
system
is
a
more
rapid
method
of
making
the
letters
or
signals
the
irregular
intervals
at
which
the
sparks
from
the
coil
of
the
transmitter
fly
from
one
terminal
to
the
other
render
it
impossible
to
split
up
the
succession
of
flashes
into
intervals
on
the
principle
without
providing
for
each
dot
a
much
longer
period
of
time
than
is
required
for
the
transmission
of
messages
on
land
lines
in
fact
the
need
for
going
slowly
in
the
sending
of
the
message
is
the
principal
which
disconcerts
ordinary
telegraphic
operators
when
they
come
to
try
wireless
telegraphy
for
remedying
this
defect
the
most
hopeful
outlook
is
in
the
direction
of
a
multiplication
of
the
pieces
of
apparatus
for
and
the
combining
of
pairs
of
them
in
such
a
way
that
whenever
the
first
one
fails
during
an
appreciable
interval
of
time
to
emit
a
spark
the
second
is
called
into
requisition
in
this
way
a
constant
stream
of
sparks
may
be
ensured
without
incurring

risk
of
running

increased

telegraphy
by
the
ordinary
system
of
transmission
by
wire
and
facility
in
making
the
records
at
the
receiving
end
in
easily
read
typewriting
these
are
two
desiderata
which
at
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
been
almost
attained
but
which
will
take
some
time
to
introduce
to
general
notice
in
the
commercial
system
of
the
twentieth
century
the
merchant
clerk
will
write
his
messages
on
a
typewriter
which
perforates
a
strip
of
paper
with
holes
corresponding
to
the
various
letters
while
it
sets
down
in
printing
on
another
strip
the
letters
themselves
the
latter
will
be
kept
as
a
record
but
the
former
will
be
taken
to
the
telegraph
office
and
put
through
the
sending
machine
without
being
read
by
the
operator
the
message
will
print
itself
at
the
other
end
and
wrap
itself
up
in
secret
nothing
but
the
address
being
made
visible
to
the
operator
for
the
use
of
the
general
public
who
are
not
possessed
of
the
special
apparatus
necessary
to
perforate
the
paper
another
system
is
available
sets
of
movable
type
may
be
provided
at
the
telegraph
office
in
small
compartments
the
letters
being
on
one
side
and
indentations
corresponding
to
the
required
perforations
being
cut
or
stamped
into
the
other
sides
of
the
movable
pieces
the
sender
of
a
message
will
set
it
up
in
a
long
shallow
tray
or
galley
like
those
used
by
printers
and
he
will
then
turn
the
faces
of
the
letters
downwards
and
see
the
whole
passed
through
the
machine
without
being
read
by
the
operator
after
which
he
can
distribute
the
letters
if
he
chooses
in
this
way
telegraphy
will
gradually
become
at
once
far
more
secret
and
far
cheaper
than
it
is
at
present
and
a
large
amount
of
correspondence
which
at
present
passes
through
the
post
will
be
sent
along
the
wire
many
merchants
will
have
their
telephonic
apparatus
fitted
with
arrangements
for
setting
up
type
or
perforating
strips
of
paper
as
already
described
and
also
with
receiving
apparatus
for
making
the
records
in
typewriting
if
they
fail
to
find
a
subscriber
or
correspondent
on
hand
at
the
time
when
he
is
wanted
they
can
write
a
note
to
him
which
he
will
find
hanging
on
a
paper
strip
from
his
telephone
when
he
returns
another
mode
of
accomplishing
a
somewhat
similar
result
is
to
provide
the
telephone
receiver
itself
with
a
moving
strip
of
steel
which
in
its
varying
degrees
of
magnetisation
records
the
spoken
words
so
that
they
will
at
some
distance
of
time
actuate
the
diaphragm
of
the
receiver
and
emit
spoken
words
the
degree
of
permanency
which
can
be
attained
by
this
system
is
of
course
a
vital
point
as
regards
its
practical
merits
still
unsolved
electrical
problems
are
the
making
of
a
satisfactory
alternate
current
motor
suitable
for
running
with
the
kind
of
currents
generally
used
for
electric
lighting
purposes
the
utilisation
of
the
glow
lamp
having
a
partial
vacuum
or
attenuated
gas
for
giving
a
cheap
and
soft
light
somewhat
on
the
principle
of
the
geissler
tube
and
last
but
not
least
the
direct
conversion
of
heat
into
electricity
with
regard
to
the
the
prospects
have
been
materially
altered
by
a
discovery
announced
at
the
new
york
meeting
of
the
american
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
within
a
few
weeks
of
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
handy
and
effective
alternate
current
motor
indeed
seemed
then
as
far
distant
as
it
had
been
in
when
sir
david
salomons
remarked
in
his
work
on
light
vol
no
satisfactory
alternate
current
motor
available
on
all
circuits
exists
as
yet
although
he
added
later
the
demand
for
such
an
appliance
increases
daily
it
seems
however
that
electricians
have
been
looking
in
the
wrong
direction
for
the
solution
of
using
the
same
wire
for
alternate
current
lighting
and
for
motive
power
at
the
same
time
professor
bedell
of
cornell
university
announced
at
the
new
york
meeting
referred
to
his
discovery
of
the
important
fact
that
when
direct
and
alternate
currents
are
sent
over
the
same
line
each
behaves
as
if
the
other
were
not
there
and
thus
the
same
line
can
be
used
for
two
distinct
systems
of
transmitting
electrical
energy
no
time
will
be
lost
in
putting
this
announcement
to
the
test
not
only
of
scientific
but
also
of
practical
verification
and
the
probability
is
that
all
electric
lighting
stations
in
the
twentieth
century
will
contain
not
only
dynamos
of
one
type
for
the
supply
of
light
but
also
direct
current
generators
for
transmitting
power
in
all
directions
over
the
same
cables
the
glow
lamp
having
no
carbon
filament
but
setting
up
a
bright
light
with
only
a
fraction
of
the
resistance
presented
by
carbon
would
if
perfected
render
electric
lighting
by
far
the
cheapest
as
well
as
the
best
method
of
illumination
tentative
work
has
indicated
a
high
degree
of
probability
that
success
will
be
achieved
and
the
glowing
bulb
is
at
any
rate
a
possibility
of
the
future
which
it
will
be
well
to
reckon
with
in
reference
to
the
conversion
of
heat
into
electricity
without
the
intervention
of
machinery
to
provide
motion
and
thus
to
cause
magnetic
fields
to
cross
one
another
very
little
promise
has
yet
been
shown
of
any
fundamental
principle
upon
which
a
practical
apparatus
of
the
kind
could
be
based
the
electrician
who
works
at
this
problem
has
to
begin
almost
and
his
task
is
an
immensely
difficult
one
although
on
every
ground
of
analogy
success
certainly
looks
possible
in
the
meantime
as
has
already
been
indicated
the
steam
turbine
and
dynamo
combined
working
practically
as
a
single
machine
for
the
generation
of
electricity
offers
practically
the
nearest
approach
to
direct
conversion
which
is
yet
well
in
sight
chapter
xi
warfare
the
last
notable
war
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
falsified
the
anticipations
of
nearly
all
the
makers
of
small
arms
the
magazine
rifle
was
held
to
be
so
perfect
in
its
trajectory
and
in
the
rapidity
with
which
it
could
discharge
its
convenient
store
of
cartridges
in
succession
that
the
bayonet
charge
had
been
put
outside
of
the
region
of
possibility
in
warfare
those
who
reasoned
thus
were
forgetting
to
a
large
extent
that
while
small
arms
have
been
improving
so
also
has
artillery
and
that
a
bayonet
charge
covered
by
a
demoralising
fire
of
mortars
and
artillery
is
a
very
different
thing
from
one
in
which
the
assailants
alone
are
the
targets
exposed
to
fire
given
that
two
opposing
armies
are
possessed
of
weapons
of
about
equal
capacity
for
striking
from
a
distance
they
may
do
one
another
a
great
deal
of
harm
without
coming
to
close
quarters
at
all
yet
victory
will
rest
with
the
men
who
have
sufficient
bravery
skill
and
ingenuity
to
cross
the
and
tackle
their
enemies
hand
to
hand
shells
and
other
forms
of
projected
cover
designed
to
mask
the
advance
of
cavalry
and
infantry
will
greatly
assist
in
the
work
of
rendering
this
task
of
crossing
the
less
dangerous
notwithstanding
any
possible
improvement
that
may
be
effected
in
the
already
it
has
been
observed
that
much
of
the
surprise
and
confusion
which
terrifies
those
who
have
no
bayonets
when
subjected
to
a
cannonade
and
at
the
same
time
brought
face
to
face
with
a
bayonet
charge
arises
from
the
fact
that
they
can
not
see
to
shoot
straight
owing
to
the
haze
produced
by
the
smoke
and
its
blinding
effects
upon
the
eyes
special
shells
made
for
the
express
purpose
of
covering
a
charge
will
soon
be
evolved
from
the
laboratory
of
the
chemist
in
pursuance
of
this
clue
in
addition
to
shells
and
other
missiles
small
pieces
of
will
be
projected
by
mortars
into
the
zone
in
order
to
supplement
the
defects
of
natural
cover
which
of
course
are
nearly
always
as
great
as
possible
seeing
that
the
ground
has
generally
been
selected
by
the
side
against
which
the
attack
is
being
directed
the
task
of
enabling
a
rifleman
to
shoot
straight
has
been
taken
up
with
extraordinary
zeal
and
ability
compared
with
the
amount
of
skill
and
effort
devoted
to
the
corresponding
or
opposing
object
of
spoiling
his
aim
and
preventing
him
from
getting
a
shot
in
when
this
latter
has
been
to
some
extent
accomplished
mainly
by
the
agency
of
artillery
the
bayonet
and
other
weapons
for
use
at
close
quarters
will
once
more
be
in
the
ascendant
thin
shields
of
hard
steel
will
be
affixed
to
the
rifles
of
the
attacking
party
so
as
to
deflect
the
bullets
wherever
possible
this
baffling
of
the
rifleman
by
the
artillery
supporting
the
cavalry
and
bayonet
charge
will
produce
momentous
changes
not
only
in
the
future
of
war
but
also
in
that
of
international
relations
anything
which
tends
to
discount
the
value
of
personal
bravery
and
to
elevate
the
tactics
of
the
ambuscade
and
the
expedition
gives
an
advantage
to
the
races
of
mankind
and
places
them
more
or
less
in
a
position
of
mastery
over
those
who
hold
higher
racial
traditions
the
man
who
will
face
the
risk
of
being
shot
in
the
open
generally
belongs
to
a
higher
type
of
humanity
than
he
who
only
shoots
from
behind
cover
moreover
the
nations
which
have
the
skill
and
ingenuity
to
manufacture
new
weapons
of
belong
to
a
higher
class
than
those
which
only
acquire
advanced
warlike
munitions
by
purchase
one
of
the
early
international
movements
of
the
twentieth
century
will
be
directed
towards
the
prohibition
of
the
sale
of
such
weapons
as
field
guns
and
torpedoes
to
any
savage
or
barbarous
race
it
will
be
accounted
as
treason
to
civilisation
for
any
member
of
the
international
family
to
permit
its
manufacturers
to
sell
the
latest
patterns
of
weapons
to
races
whose
ascendency
might
possibly
become
a
menace
to
civilisation
as
factors
in
determining
the
survival
of
the
fittest
the
elements
of
high
character
bravery
and
intellectual
development
must
be
conserved
in
their
maximum
efficiency
at
all
hazards
another
potent
element
in
the
safeguards
of
civilisation
may
be
seen
in
the
increased
effectiveness
of
weapons
for
coastal
defence
the
hideous
nightmare
of
a
barbarian
irruption
such
as
those
which
almost
erased
culture
and
intellect
from
the
face
of
europe
during
the
dark
ages
of
the
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
centuries
may
occasionally
be
seen
exercising
its
influence
in
the
pessimistic
writings
which
are
from
time
to
time
issued
from
the
press
predicting
the
coming
ascendency
of
the
yellow
man
however
the
case
may
be
in
regard
to
nations
which
are
accessible
by
land
to
the
encroachments
of
the
asiatic
there
is
no
doubt
that
those
countries
which
are
divided
off
by
the
sea
have
been
rendered
much
more
secure
through
the
rapid
advances
which
have
been
made
in
the
modern
appliances
for
defending
coasts
and
harbours
in
naval
tactics
also
it
will
be
more
and
more
clearly
seen
that
to
possess
and
defend
the
harbours
where
coaling
can
be
carried
out
is
practically
to
possess
and
defend
the
trade
of
the
high
seas
and
the
essence
of
good
maritime
policy
will
be
to
so
locate
the
defended
harbours
that
they
may
afford
the
greatest
amount
of
protection
having
in
view
the
harm
that
may
be
done
by
an
enemy
harbours
in
the
vicinity
the
most
effective
naval
weapon
in
the
future
will
undoubtedly
be
the
torpedo
but
like
the
bayonet
it
requires
to
be
in
the
hands
of
brave
men
before
its
value
as
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
naval
conflict
can
be
demonstrated
much
fallacious
teaching
has
arisen
from
what
has
been
called
the
lessons
of
certain
naval
wars
which
occurred
on
the
coasts
of
south
america
and
china
international
embroilments
in
which
mercenaries
or
only
seamen
and
engineers
were
engaged
on
similar
fallacious
grounds
it
was
argued
that
the
had
put
the
bayonet
out
of
the
court
of
military
arbitrament
and
the
south
african
war
has
proved
conclusively
how
erroneous
was
that
idea
the
use
of
the
and
of
the
weapons
which
it
carries
must
always
demand
like
that
of
the
bayonet
men
of
the
strongest
nerve
and
of
the
greatest
devotion
to
their
duty
and
to
their
country
fifty
miles
an
hour
is
a
rate
which
is
already
in
sight
as
the
speed
of
the
future
the
first
turbine
steamer
of
the
british
navy
having
achieved
miles
an
hour
before
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
should
be
distinctly
understood
however
that
such
a
speed
can
not
be
kept
up
for
any
great
length
of
time
and
that
long
voyages
are
out
of
the
question
the
rôle
of
the
turbine
will
be
to
get
home
with
its
weapon
in
the
shortest
practicable
time
hence
its
great
value
for
the
defence
of
harbours
by
striking
at
distances
of
perhaps
two
or
three
hours
steaming
on
the
high
seas
the
which
will
virtually
be
the
cruisers
of
the
future
will
be
provided
with
turbine
carried
slung
in
convenient
positions
and
ready
at
short
notice
to
be
let
slip
like
greyhounds
during
the
hazardous
run
of
the
towards
the
enemy
various
devices
will
be
employed
for
the
purpose
of
baffling
his
aim
such
for
instance
as
the
emission
of
volumes
of
smoke
from
the
bows
and
the
erection
of
broad
network
blinds
covering
the
sight
of
the
little
craft
but
capable
of
being
shifted
from
side
to
side
so
that
the
enemy
marksmen
may
never
know
exactly
what
part
of
the
object
in
sight
is
to
be
aimed
at
the
torpedo
will
be
carried
on
a
mast
which
at
the
right
moment
can
be
lowered
to
form
a
projecting
spar
like
a
bowsprit
and
the
explosion
that
will
take
place
on
its
impact
with
the
enemy
hull
will
be
enough
to
blow
a
fatal
breach
in
any
warship
afloat
for
harbour
defence
and
the
safety
of
the
the
and
propelled
torpedo
will
form
a
second
line
behind
the
fast
this
type
of
weapon
strikes
with
more
unerring
accuracy
than
any
other
yet
included
in
the
armoury
of
naval
warfare
because
it
is
under
the
control
of
the
marksman
from
the
time
of
its
launching
until
it
fulfils
its
deadly
mission
its
range
of
course
is
strictly
limited
but
it
may
be
worked
to
advantage
within
the
distances
at
which
the
best
naval
artillery
can
be
depended
upon
to
make
good
practice
the
least
costly
and
the
lightest
form
is
that
in
which
the
backward
pulling
of
two
wires
unwinding
two
drums
on
the
torpedo
actuates
two
screws
at
greater
or
less
speeds
according
to
the
rapidity
of
the
motion
imparted
any
advantage
of
speed
in
one
screw
over
the
other
being
responded
to
by
an
alteration
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
weapon
the
torpedo
may
be
set
so
as
to
dive
from
the
surface
at
any
desired
interval
but
of
course
an
appearance
in
the
form
of
at
least
a
flash
is
necessary
to
enable
the
operator
to
judge
in
what
direction
he
is
sending
his
missile
small
not
manned
but
sticking
to
the
surface
may
be
used
in
the
same
manner
each
one
no
doubt
runs
a
very
great
risk
of
being
hit
by
shot
or
shell
aimed
at
them
but
out
of

at

intervals
it
would
be
practically
impossible
for
an
enemy
to
make
certain
that
one
at

did
not
find
its
billet
the
submarine
boat
will
have
some
useful
applications
in
peace
but
its
range
of
utility
in
warfare
is
likely
to
be
very
limited
it
is
hopeless
to
expect
the
eyes
of
sailors
to
see
any
great
distance
under
the
water
therefore
the
descent
must
be
made
within
sight
of
the
enemy
who
has
only
to
surround
himself
with
placed
hanging
to
a
depth
and
to
pollute
the
water
in
order
to
render
the
assault
an
absolutely
desperate
enterprise
military
aeronautics
like
submarine
operations
in
naval
warfare
have
been
somewhat
overrated
visions
of
hovering
over
a
doomed
city
and
devastating
it
with
missiles
dropped
from
above
are
mere
fairy
tales
indeed
the
whole
subject
of
aeronautics
as
an
element
in
future
human
progress
has
excited
far
more
attention
than
its
intrinsic
merits
deserve
a
balloon
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
must
remain
so
while
a
true
flying
machine
which
supports
itself
in
the
air
by
the
operation
of
fans
or
similar
devices
may
be
interesting
as
a
toy
but
can
not
have
much
economical
importance
for
the
future
when
man
has
the
solid
earth
upon
which
to
conduct
his
traffic
without
the
necessity
of
overcoming
the
force
of
gravitation
by
costly
power
he
would
be
foolish
in
the
extreme
to
attempt
to
abandon
the
advantage
which
this
gives
him
and
to
commit
himself
to
such
an
element
as
the
air
in
which
the
power
required
to
lift
himself
and
his
goods
would
be
immeasurably
greater
than
that
needed
to
transport
them
from
place
to
place
the
amount
of
misdirected
ingenuity
that
has
been
expended
on
these
two
problems
of
submarine
and
aerial
navigation
during
the
nineteenth
century
will
offer
one
of
the
most
curious
and
interesting
studies
to
the
future
historian
of
technological
progress
unfortunately
that
faculty
of
the
constructive
imagination
upon
which
inventive
talent
depends
may
too
frequently
be
indulged
by
its
possessor
without
any
serious
reference
to
the
question
of
utility
fancy
paints
a
picture
in
which
the
inventor
appears
disporting
himself
at
depths
below
the
surface
of
the
sea
or
at
extraordinary
heights
above
the
level
of
the
land
while
his
friends
his
rivals
and
all
manner
of
men
and
women
besides
gaze
with
amazement
patent
agents
are
only
too
well
aware
how
often
an
inordinate
desire
for
goes
along
with
real
inventive
talent
and
how
many
of
the
brotherhood
of
inventors
make
light
of
the
losses
which
may
be
inflicted
upon
trusting
investors
so
long
as
they
themselves
may
get
well
talked
about
nations
may
at
times
be
infected
with
this
unpractical
vainglory
of
inventiveness
and
on
these
occasions
there
is
need
of
all
the
restraining
influence
of
the
business
man
to
prevent
the
waste
of
enormous
sums
of
money
the
idea
that
military
ascendency
in
the
future
is
to
be
secured
by
the
ability
to
fly
through
the

and
to
dive

distances

taken
possession
of
certain

in

germany
russia
great

and
the

large
numbers
of
voluble
boulevardiers
in
paris
have
during
the
last
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
made
it
an
article
of
their
patriotic
faith
that
the
future
success
of
the
french
navy
depends
upon
the
submarine
boat
the
question
as
to
what
an
enemy
would
do
with
such
a
boat
in
actual
warfare
seems
hardly
ever
to
occur
to
them
and
indeed
any
one
who
should
venture
to
put
such
a
query
would
run
the
risk
of
being
set
down
as
a
traitor
to
his
country
more
important
to
the
student
of
the
practical
details
of
naval
preparation
is
the
great
question
as
to
the
point
at
which
the
contest
between
shot
and
armour
will
be
brought
to
a
standstill
that
it
can
not
proceed
indefinitely
may
be
confidently
taken
for
granted
the
thicken
their
armour
while
the
enlarge
the
size
and
increase
the
penetrative
power
of
their
weapons
until
the
weight
that
has
to
be
carried
on
a
renders
the
attainment
of
speed
practically
impossible
meanwhile
there
is
going
forward
in
the
hull
of
the
vessel
itself
a
gradual
course
of
evolution
which
will
eventually
place
the
policy
of
increasing
strength
of
armour
and
of
guns
at
a
discount
the
division
of
the
of
a
warship
into
compartments
will
doubtless
prove
to
be
in
actual
naval
conflict
a
more
effectual
means
of
keeping
the
vessel
afloat
than
the
indefinite
increase
in
the
thickness
and
consequent
weight
of
her
armour
the
most
advanced
naval
architects
of
modern
times
are
bestowing
more
and
more
attention
upon
this
feature
as
affording
a
prospect
of
rendering
ships
unsinkable
whether
through
accidents
or
through
injury
in
warfare
no
doubt
for
merchant
steamers
it
will
be
seen
that
development
along
the
lines
already
laid
down
in
this
department
will
suffice
for
all
practical
purposes
the
bulkheads
with
readily
closed
or
automatically
shutting
doorways
ensure
the
maintenance
of
buoyancy
in
case
of
any
ordinary
accident
from
collision
or
grounding
while
the
duplication
of
engines
shafts
and
propellers
without
which
no
steamship
of
the
middle
twentieth
century
will
be
passed
by
marine
surveyors
as
fit
for
carrying
passengers
on
long
ocean
voyages
will
make
provision
against
all
excepting
the
most
extremely
improbable
mishaps
to
the
machinery
if
the
numerical
estimate
of
the
chance
of
the
disablement
of
a
single
engine
and
its
propeller
during
a
certain
voyage
be
stated
at
one
to
a
thousand
then
the
risk
of
helplessness
through
the
break
down
of
both
systems
in
a
vessel
having
twin
screws
and
entirely
separate
engines
will
be
represented
by
the
proportion
of
one
to
a
million
this
mode
of
reckoning
of
course
assumes
that
the
two
systems
could
be
made
absolutely
independent
in
relation
to
all
possible
disasters
and
some
deduction
must
be
made
on
account
of
the
impossibility
of
attaining
this
ideal
yet
it
is
evident
that
when
every
practicable
device
has
been
adopted
for
rendering
a
double
accident
improbable
the
chances
against
such
a
disaster
will
not
be
far
from
the
proportion
stated
when
we
come
to
consider
the
evolution
of
the
warship
as
compared
with
that
of
the
merchant
steamer
we
are
at
once
confronted
with
the
fact
that
the
infliction
of
injury
upon
the
boilers
the
engine
or
the
propellers
of
a
hostile
vessel
is
the
great
object
aimed
at
by
the
gunners
the
evolution
of
the
warship
in
the
direction
of
ensuring
safety
therefore
will
not
stop
at
the
duplication
of
the
engines
boilers
and
propellers
in
fact
it
must
sooner
or
later
be
apparent
that
the
interests
of
a
great
naval
power
demand
the
working
out
of
a
type
of
warlike
craft
that
shall
be
almost
entirely
destitute
of
armour
but
constructed
on
such
a
principle
both
as
to
hull
and
machinery
that
she
can
be
raked
fore
and
aft
and
shot
through
in
all
directions
without
becoming
either
or
deprived
of
her
motive
power
a
built
on
this
system
may
consist
essentially
of
a
series
of
steel
tubes
of
large
section
grouped
longitudinally
and
divided
into
compartments
like
those
of
a
bamboo
cane
each
of
these
has
its
own
small
but
powerful
boilers
and
engines
and
each
its
separate
propeller
at
the
stern
care
also
is
taken
to
place
the
machinery
of
each
tube
in
such
a
position
that
no
two
are
abreast
in
fact
the
principle
of
construction
is
such
as
to
render
just
as
remote
as
may
be
the
possibility
of
any
shot
passing
through
the
vessel
and
disabling
two
at
the
same
time
if
a
boat
of
this
description
has
each
tube
furnished
not
only
with
a
separate
screw
at
the
stern
but
also
with
a
torpedo
at
the
bows
it
can
offer
a
most
serious
menace
to
even
the
most
powerful
afloat
because
its
power
of
getting
home
with
a
missile
depends
not
upon
its
protective
precautions
but
upon
an
appeal
to
the
law
of
averages
which
makes
it
practically
impossible
for
any
gunners
however
skilful
to
disable
all
its
independent
sections
during
the
run
from
long
range
to
distance
the
attacked
warship
is
like
an
animal
exposed
to
the
onslaught
of
one
of
those
fabled
reptiles
possessing
a
separate
life
and
a
separate
sting
in
each
of
its
myriad
sections
so
that
what
would
be
a
mortal
injury
to
a
creature
having
its
vital
organs
concentrated
in
one
spot
produces
only
the
most
limited
effect
in
diminishing
its
strength
and
powers
of
offence
or
this
class
of
naval
fighter
may
be
regarded
as
a
combined
fleet
of
small
bound
together
for
mutual
purposes
of
offence
and
defence
singly
they
would
present
defects
of
capacity
qualities
and
accommodation
for
crew
which
would
render
them
comparatively
helpless
and
innocuous
but
in
combination
they
possess
all
the
travelling
capacities
of
a
large
warship
conjoined
with
the
deadly
powers
at
close
quarters
of
a
number
of
torpedo
boats
all
acting
closely
in
concert
upon
a
single
plan
the
chief
naval
lesson
taught
during
the
war
was
the
need
for
improving
the
qualities
of
the
before
it
can
be
regarded
as
a
truly
effective
weapon
in
naval
warfare
it
was
announced
at
one
stage
that
if
the
spanish
fleet
could
have
been
coaled
and
at
the
azores
and
two
or
three
other
points
on
the
passage
across
to
america
it
might
have
been
brought
within
striking
distance
of
the
united
states
cruisers
operating
against
santiago
this
hypothetical
statement
provided
but
cold
comfort
for
the
spaniards
who
had
been
persuaded
to
put
so
much
of
their
available
naval
strength
into
a
type
of
craft
utterly
unsuited
for
operations
complying
with
the
first
great
requirement
of
naval
warfare
namely
that
the
proper
limit
of
the
campaign
coincides
with
the
shores
of
the
enemy
country
but
when
the
naval
architect
and
the
engineer
have
evolved
a
class
of
vessel
which
can
both
travel
far
and
strike
hard
and
which
moreover
can
stand
a
few
shots
penetrating
her
without
succumbing
to
their
effect
a
new
era
will
have
been
opened
up
in
naval
warfare
an
era
of
high
explosive
weapons
requiring
to
strike
home
with
dash
and
bravery
in
spite
of
risk
from
shot
and
shell
but
like
the
bayonet
on
land
capable
of
overthrowing
all
which
can
only
strike
from
a
considerable
distance
chapter

music
a
perfect
piano
has
been
the
dream
of
many
a
musician
whose
ardent
desire
it
was
to
perform
his
music
exactly
as
it
was
written
a
sustained
piano
note
is
indeed
the
great
mechanical
desideratum
for
the
music
of
the
future
in
music
as
at
present
written
and
published
for
the
piano
which
is
and
must
continue
to
be
the
real
king
of
instruments
there
is
a
good
deal
of
a
long
note
or
two
notes
tied
in
a
certain
method
is
intended
to
be
played
as
a
continued
sound
like
the
note
of
an
organ
whereas
there
is
no
piano
in
existence
which
will
produce
anything
even
approximately
approaching
to
that
effect
the
characteristic
of
the
piano
as
an
instrument
is
producing
at
the
moment
of
striking
the
note
a
loud
sound
which
almost
immediately
dies
away
and
leaves
but
a
faint
vibration
the
phonographic
record
of
a
pianoforte
solo
shows
this
very
clearly
to
the
eye
because
the
impression
made
by
a
long
note
is
a
indentation
succeeded
by
the
merest
shallow
scratch
not
unlike
the
impression
made
by
a
tadpole
on
mud
with
a
big
head
and
an
attenuated
body
every
note
marked
long
in
pianoforte
music
is
therefore
essentially
a
followed
by
a
rapid
anything
in
such
music
marked
as
a
long
note
to
be
sustained
the
most
thrilling
effect
of
orchestral
choral
and
organ
music
is
necessarily
a
sham
and
a
delusion
the
genius
and
skill
which
have
enabled
the
masters
of
pianoforte
composition
not
only
to
cover
up
this
defect
in
their
instrument
but
even
to
make
amends
for
it
by
working
out
effects
only
suitable
for
a
percussion
note
present
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
of
musical
progress
in
the
nineteenth
century
so
notable
is
that
fact
in
its
relation
to
the
pianoforte
accompaniments
of
vocal
music
that
it
seems
open
to
question
whether
even
in
the
presence
of
a
thoroughly
satisfactory
piano
much
use
would
for
many
years
be
made
of
it
for
this
particular
purpose
the
effects
of
repeated
notes
succeeding
one
another
with
increasing
or
decreasing
force
and
of
passages
have
been
so
fully
explored
and
made
available
in
standard
music
of
every
grade
that
necessarily
the
public
taste
has
set
itself
to
appreciate
the
pianoforte
solo
and
the
accompanied
song
exactly
as
they
are
written
and
performed
these
are
after
all
the
highest
forms
of
music
which
civilisation
has
yet
enabled
one
or
two
performers
to
produce
yet
in
regard
to
solo
instrumentalisation
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
general
hope
exists
for
the
discovery
of
a
compromise
between
the
piano
and
the
organ
or
between
the
piano
and
the
string
band
some
inventors
have
aimed
in
the
latter
direction
and
others
in
the
former
but
no
one
has
succeeded
in
really
recommending
his
ideas
to
the
public
combined
and
have
been
shown
at
each
of
the
great
exhibitions
from
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
its
close
several
of
these
instruments
have
been
devised
and
constructed
with
great
ingenuity
and
yet
practically
all
of
them
have
been
received
by
the
musical
profession
either
with
indifference
or
with
positive
ridicule
the
fact
is
that
revolutionary
sudden
changes
in
musical
instruments
are
rendered
impossible
owing
to
the
near
relationship
which
exists
between
each
instrument
and
the
general
body
of
the
music
that
is
written
for
it
no
one
can
divorce
the
two
which
as
a
factor
in
æsthetic
progress
are
really
one
and
indivisible
therefore
if
any
man
invents
a
musical
instrument
which
requires
for
its
success
the
sudden
evolution
of
a
new
race
of
composers
writing
for
it
and
a
new
type
of
educated
public
taste
to
hail
these
composers
with
delight
he
is
asking
for
a
miracle
and
he
will
be
disappointed
what
is
wanted
is
not
a
new
instrument
but
an
improved
piano
that
shall
at
one
and
the
same
time
correct
to
some
extent
the
defects
of
the
existing
instrument
and
leave
still
available
all
the
brilliant
effects
which
have
been
invented
for
it
by
a
generation
of
musical
geniuses
we
want
the
sustained
note
and
yet
we
do
not
wish
to
lose
the
pretty
turns
and
graceful
devices
by
which
the
lack
of
it
has
been
hidden
or
atoned
for
in
the
works
of
the
masters
therefore
our
sustained
note
must
not
be
too
aggressive
for
a
long
time
indeed
it
must
partake
of
the
very
defects
which
it
is
intended
ultimately
to
abolish
in
other
words
we
want
to
retain
the
percussion
note
with
the
dampers
and
with
the
loud
and
soft
pedals
in
fact
all
the
existing
inventions
for
coaxing
some
of
the
notes
to
sustain
themselves
while
others
are
cut
short
as
may
be
desired
and
at
the
same
time
we
have
to
add
other
and
more
effective
means
to
assist
the
performer
in
achieving
the
same
object
the
more
or
less
complicated
methods
aiming
at
the
prolongation
of
the
residual
effect
of
the
percussion
have
apparently
been
very
nearly
exhausted
some
of
the
most
modern
pianos
are
really
marvels
of
mechanical
ingenuity
applied
to
this
purpose
we
have
now
to
look
to
something
slightly
resembling
the
principle
of
the
violin
or
of
the
organ
in
order
to
secure
the
additional
effect
for
which
we
are
searching
having
to
deal
with
a
piano
in
practically
its
existing
form
we
obviously
require
to
take
special
account
of
the
fact
that
the
note
is
begun
by
percussion
and
that
any
attempt
to
bring
a
solid
substance
into
contact
with
the
wire
while
still
vibrating
with
the
object
of
continuing
its
motion
is
likely
to
produce
more
or
less
of
a
jarring
effect
the
type
of
for
effect
therefore
offers
the
most
promising
outlook
for
the
improvement
of
the
modern
piano
in
the
direction
indicated
by
directing
a
blast
of
air
from
a
very
thin
nozzle
on
to
the
vibrating
wire
of
a
piano
the
sound
emitted
may
be
very
greatly
intensified
and
although
naturally
the
decreasing
amplitude
of
the
vibration
may
in
itself
tend
to
create
a
yet
it
is
possible
to
make
up
for
this
in
some
degree
by
causing
the

increase
in
force
through
the
use
of
any
suitable
means
modified
by
an
extra
pedal
as
may
be
desired
delicate
effects
somewhat
resembling
those
of
the
eolian
lyre
are
produced
by
playing
the
notes
with
the
alone
without
the
aid
of
percussion
but
the
louder
notes
depend
upon
the
added
atmospheric
resistance
offered
by
a
strong
current
of
air
to
those
movements
of
the
wire
which
have
been
originally
set
up
by
percussion
and
the
fact
that
this
resistance
gives
rise
to
a
corresponding
continuance
of
the
motion
the
prolongation
of
a
note
in
this
way
is
analogous
to
the
continual
swinging
of
an
elastic
switch
in
a
stream
of
water
the
current
by
its
force
producing
a
rhythmic
movement
when
these
eolian
effects
as
applied
to
the
pianoforte
have
been
carefully
studied
many
devices
for
controlling
them
will
be
brought
forward
the
main
purpose
however
must
be
to
connect
the
with
the
percussion
apparatus
in
such
a
manner
that
as
soon
as
a
key
is
depressed
the
nozzle
of
that
particular
note
in
the
is
opened
exactly
at
the
same
time
that
the
wire
is
struck
by
the
hammer
and
it
remains
open
as
long
as
the
note
is
held
down
the
movement
of
an
extra
pedal
however
has
the
effect
of
throwing
the
whole
of
the
apparatus
out
of
gear
and
reducing
the
piano
to
a
percussion
instrument
pure
and
simple
it
will
be
on
the
concert
platform
no
doubt
that
this
kind
of
improvement
will
find
its
first
field
of
usefulness
performers
will
require
in
addition
to
their
grand
pianos
reservoirs
of
compressed
air
attachable
by
tubes
to
their
instruments
in
private
houses
hydraulic
will
be
found
more
convenient
when
the
piano
has
by
some
such
means
acquired
the
faculty
of
its
notes
as
well
as
of
them
its
ascendency
as
the
finest
instrument
adapted
to
solo
instrumentalism
will
be
assured
the
common
domestic
piano
is
rightly
regarded
by
many
people
as
being
little
better
than
an
instrument
of
torture
one
reason
for
this
aversion
is
that
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
the
household
instrument
is
not
kept
in
tune
probably
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
man
who
would
invent
a
sound
cottage
piano
which
would
remain
in
tune
would
do
more
for
the
improvement
of
the
national
taste
in
music
than
the
largest
and
finest
orchestra
ever
assembled
the
constantly
vitiated
sense
of
hearing
which
is
brought
about
by
the
continual
jangle
of
notes
just
a
fractional
part
of
a
tone
out
of
tune
is
responsible
for
much
of
the
distaste
for
good
music
which
prevails
among
the
people
when
the
domestic
instrument
is
but
imperfectly
tuned
it
is
natural
that
those
pieces
should
be
preferred
which
suffer
least
by
reason
of
the
imperfection
and
these
it
need
hardly
be
remarked
generally
belong
to
the
class
of
music
which
must
be
rated
as
essentially
inferior
if
not
vulgar
the
device
of
winding
a
string
round
a
peg
and
twisting
it
up
on
the
latter
in
order
to
obtain
tension
for
a
vibrating
note
is
thousands
of
years
old
it
was
the
method
by
which
tension
was
imparted
to
some
of
the
earliest
harps
and
lyres
of
which
history
is
cognisant
and
it
is
still
to
be
found
in
the
most
elaborate
and
costly
grand
piano
with
but
few
alterations
affecting
its
principle
of
action
the
pianoforte
of
the
future
will
be
kept
in
tune
by
more
exact
and
scientific
methods
attaining
a
certain
balance
between
the
thickness
of
the
wire
and
the
tension
placed
upon
it
by
means
of
springs
and
weights
besides
the
ravages
of
the
piano
much
suffering
is
inflicted
by
the
barbarous
habit
of
permitting
a
sounding
instrument
to
be
used
for
mere
mechanical
exercises
the
taste
of
the
pupil
is
vitiated
and
the
nerves
of
other
inmates
of
the
house
are
subjected
to
a
source
of
constant
irritation
when
long
series
of
notes
arranged
merely
as
muscular
exercises
and
some
of
them
violating
almost
every
rule
of
musical
form
are
ground
out
hour
after
hour
like
coffee
from
a
the
inconsistency
of
subjecting
the
musical
ear
and
taste
of
a
boy
or
girl
to
this
process
and
then
expecting
the
child
to
develop
an
innate
taste
for
the
delicacies
of
form
in
melody
and
of
the
beauty
of
harmony
is
almost
as
bad
as
would
be
that
of
asking
a
chinese
victim
of
to
walk
easily
and
gracefully
the
use
of
the
digitorium
for
promoting
the
mechanical
portion
of
a
musical
education
by
the
training
of
the
fingers
has
already
to
some
slight
extent
obviated
the
evils
complained
of
but
this
instrument
is
as
yet
only
in
its
rudimentary
stage
of
development
the
dumb
notes
of
the
keyboard
ought
to
be
capable
of
emitting
sounds
by
way
of
notice
to
the
operator
in
order
to
show
when
the
rules
have
been
broken
thus
for
instance
the
impact
caused
by
putting
a
key
down
should
have
the
effect
of
driving
a
small
weight
upwards
in
the
direction
of
a
metal
bar
the
distance
of
which
can
be
adjusted
another
bar
at
a
lower
level
is
also
approached
by
a
second
weight
and
the
perfect
degree
of
evenness
in
the
touch
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
the
lower
bar
should
be
made
to
emit
a
faint
sound
with
every
note
but
the
higher
one
not
at
all
the
closer
the
bars
the
more
difficult
is
the
exercise
and
remarkable
evenness
of
touch
can
be
acquired
by
a
progressive
training
with
such
an
instrument
the
organ
has
been
wonderfully
improved
during
the
nineteenth
century
yet
the
decline
of
its
popularity
in
comparison
with
the
pianoforte
may
be
accounted
for
on
very
rational
grounds
while
ardent
organists
still
claim
that
the
organ
is
the
king
of
instruments
the
public
generally
entertain
a
feeling
that
it
is
a
deposed
king
it
remains
for
the
of
the
twentieth
century
to
attack
the
problem
of
curing
its
defects
by
methods
going
more
directly
to
the
root
of
the
difficulty
than
any
hitherto
attempted
as
contrasted
with
the
pianoforte
the
organ
is
extremely
deficient
in
that
power
which
the
conductor
of
an
orchestra
loves
to
exercise
facility
in
accentuating
and
in
subduing
at
will
the
work
of
each
individual
performer
for
all
practical
purposes
the
ten
fingers
of
a
are
the
ten
players
in
an
orchestra
and
according
to
the
force
with
which
each
finger
strikes
the
note
is
the
prominence
given
to
its
effects
an
air
or
a
may
be
brought
out
with
emphasis
by
one
set
of
fingers
while
the
others
are
playing
an
accompaniment
with
all
sorts
of
delicate
gradations
of
softness
and
emphasis
by
multiplying
the
manuals
the
has
endeavoured
with
a
certain
degree
of
success
to
make
up
for
the
unfortunate
fact
that
the
performer
on
his
instrument
possesses
no
similar
facility
in
making
it
speak
louder
when
he
submits
the
note
to
extra
pressure
one
hand
may
be
playing
an
air
on
one
manual
while
the
second
is
engaged
in
the
accompaniment
on
another
and
the
former
may
be
connected
with
a
louder
stop
or
with
one
of
a
more
penetrating
quality
than
the
latter
this
device
together
with
an
elaborate
arrangement
of
swells
and
has
greatly
enlarged
the
capacity
of
the
organ
for
producing
those
choral
effects
which
mainly
depend
upon
gradations
of
volume
yet
the
whole
system
elaborate
as
it
is
offers
but
a
poor
substitute
for
the
marvellous
range
of
individuality
that
may
be
expressed
on
the
notes
of
the
piano
by
instantaneous
changes
in
the
values
ascribed
to
single
notes
by
the
same
action
of
his
finger
the
pianist
not
only
makes
the
note
but
also
gives
its
value
while
the
method
of
the
organist
is
to
neglect
the
element
of
and
to
rely
upon
other
methods
for
imparting
emphasis
or
softness
to
his
work
an
organ
that
shall
emit
a
louder
or
softer
note
according
to
the
force
with
which
the
key
on
the
manual
is
depressed
will
no
doubt
be
one
of
the
musical
instruments
of
the
twentieth
century
whether
each
key
will
be
fitted
with
a
resisting
spring
or
whether
the
lever
will
be
constructed
in
such
a
way
as
to
throw
a
weight
to
a
higher
or
lower
grade
of
position
according
to
the
force
with
which
it
is
struck
is
a
question
which
will
depend
upon
the
results
of
experiment
but
the
latter
method
is
more
in
consonance
with
the
conditions
which
have
given
to
the
piano
its
wonderful
versatility
and
it
therefore
seems
the
more
probable
solution
of
the
two
upon
the
vigour
of
the
impact
will
depend
the
height
to
which
a
valve
is
thrown
and
this
will
determine
the
speed
and
volume
of
the
air
which
is
liberated
to
rush
into
the
pipe
and
make
the
note
the
nineteenth
century
orchestra
is
a
fearfully
and
wonderfully
constructed
agglomeration
of
ancient
and
modern
instruments
its
merits
are
attested
by
the
fine
musical
sense
of
the
most
experienced
conductors
whose
aim
it
has
been
so
to
balance
the
different
instruments
as
to
produce
a
effect
while
at
the
same
time
providing
for
solos
and
also
for
the
rendering
of
parts
in
which
a
small
number
of
performers
may
contribute
to
the
unfolding
of
the
composer
ideas
the
orchestra
can
not
therefore
be
examined
or
discussed
from
a
mechanical
point
of
view
however
much
some
of
the
instruments
of
which
it
is
composed
may
be
thought
capable
of
improvement
but
the
position
of
the
conductor
himself
in
the
front
of
an
orchestra
is
from
a
purely
artistic
standpoint
highly
anomalous
it
is
as
if
the
prompter
at
the
performance
of
a
drama
were
to
be
seen
taking
the
most
conspicuous
part
and
mixing
among
the
actors
upon
the
stage
if
an
orchestral
piece
be
well
played
without
the
visible
presence
of
a
conductor
the
sense
of
correct
time
reaches
the
audience
naturally
through
the
music
itself
and
any
sort
of
gesticulations
intended
to
mark
it
are
under
these
conditions
regarded
as
being
out
of
place
the
foremost
orchestral
conductors
of
the
day
are
evidently
impressed
with
this
unfitness
of
the
mechanical
marking
of
time
by
the
wild
waving
of
a
stick
or
swaying
of
the
body
and
accordingly
however
much
they
exert
themselves
at
the
rehearsal
they
purposely
subdue
their
motions
during
a
public
performance
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
the
object
of
the
conductor
will
be
to
guide
his
band
without
permitting
his
promptings
to
be
perceived
in
any
way
by
the
audience
for
this
purpose
an
electric
will
prove
useful
various
proposals
for
its
application
have
been
put
forward
and
for
different
purposes
several
of
them
are
obviously
feasible
for
instance
in
one
system
the
conductor
sits
in
a
place
hidden
from
the
audience
and
beats
time
on
an
electric
which
admits
of
his
sending
a
special
message
to
any
particular
performer
whenever
he
desires
to
do
so
the
signal
which
marks
the
time
may
be
given
to
each
performer
either
visually
by
a
beater
concealed
within
a
small
cavity
affixed
to
his
desk
or
to
his
electric
light
or
it
may
be
conveyed
by
the
sense
of
touch
through
a
mechanical
beater
within
a
small
metal
weight
placed
on
the
floor
and
upon
which
he
sets
one
of
his
feet
the
electric
in
the
latter
system
thus
taps
the
measure
gently
on
the
sole
of
the
performer
foot
and
special
signals
as
may
be
arranged
are
sent
to
him
by
preconcerted
combinations
of
taps
the
absence
of
any
distraction
from
the
music
itself
will
soon
be
gratefully
felt
by
audiences
and
the
playing
of
a
symphony
in
the
twentieth
century
in
which
the
whole
orchestra
moves
sympathetically
in
obedience
to
the
of
the
electric
current
will
be
the
highest
possible
presentment
of

the

practically
the
highest
achievement
of
the
graphic

in

many

the
prospect

strongly
of
opinion
that
when

this

arises
from
a
fallacy

in

the
mistake
of

after

it
was
under
the
prompting
of
a
dread
of
the
process
of
popularising
art
that
so
many
eminent
painters
of
the
nineteenth
century
protested
against
the
fashion
set
by
sir
millais
when
he
sold
such
pictures
as
cherry
ripe
and
bubbles
knowing
they
were
intended
for
reproduction
in
very
large
numbers
by
mechanical
means
from
a
somewhat
similar
motive
a
few
of
the
leading
artists
of
the
nineteenth
century
for
a
time
stood
aloof
from
the
movement
for
familiarising
the
people
with
at

the
form

not
the
colouring
of
each
notable
picture
of

very
unpretentious
beginnings
the

of
the
royal

of

have
brought
down
the

being
fully

the

as

for
the
right
of

increases
the
artists
who
have
painted
the
most
suitable
and
most
popular
pictures
will
find
that
they
can
get
more
remuneration
for
copyright
than
they
can
for
the
pictures
themselves
this
has
already
been
the
case
in
regard
to
a
very
limited
number
of
pictures
but
the
exception
of
the
past
will
be
the
rule
of
the
future
at
least
as
regards
those
pictures
which
possess
any
special
merits
at
all
more
thought
will
therefore
be
required
as
the
motive
or
basis
of
each
subject
and
historical
pictures
will
come
more
into
favour
the
affected
simplicity
and
mental
emptiness
of
the
school
being
discarded
in
favour
of
a
style
which
shall
speak
more
directly
to
the
people
and
stir
more
deeply
both
their
mental
and
their
emotional
natures
the
artist
and
the
printer
must
then
confer
they
can
no
longer
afford
to
work
in
the
future
with
such
disregard
of
each
other
ideas
and
methods
as
they
have
done
in
the
past
it
was
at
one
time
the
custom
among
painters
almost
to
despise
the
man
who
drew
for
the
press
in
any
shape
or
form
but
that
piece
of
affectation
has
nearly
been
destroyed
by
the
general
ridicule
with
which
it
is
now
received
and
by
the
knowledge
that
there
are
already
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
just
as
many
men
of
talent
working
by
methods
suitable
for
reproduction
as
there
are
painters
who
confine
their
attention
to
palette
canvas
and
brush
the
printer
will
now
advance
a
step
further
and
will
invoke
the
services
of
the
painter
himself
even
prescribing
certain
methods
by
which
the
press
may
be
enabled
to
reproduce
the
work
of
the
artist
more
faithfully
than
would
otherwise
be
possible
transparency
painting
will
no
doubt
be
one
of
these
methods
the
artist
will
paint
on
a
set
of
sheets
of
transparent
celluloid
or
glass
mounted
in
frames
of
wood
and
hinged
so
that
they
can
for
purposes
of
observation
be
put
aside
and
yet
brought
back
to
their
original
positions
quite
accurately
each
different
transparent
sheet
will
be
intended
for
one
pure
colour
the
only
pigments
used
being
of
the
most
transparent
description
obtainable
the
picture
may
thus
be
built
up
by
successive
additions
and
alterations
not
all
put
upon
one
surface
but
constituting
a
number
of
monochromes
superimposed
one
upon
the
other
when
finished
each
of
these
transparencies
can
then
be
reproduced
by
means
for
printing
in
the
press
by
what
are
known
as
the
photographic
interruption
processes
a
kind
of
converse
method
has
achieved
a
certain
degree
of
success
a
landscape
or
a
picture
is
photographed
several
times
from
exactly
the
same
position
but
on
each
occasion
it
is
taken
through
a
screen
of
a
different
coloured
glass
which
is
intended
for
the
purpose
of
intercepting
all
the
rays
of
light
except
those
of
one
particular
tint
coloured
prints
in
transparent
gelatine
or
other
suitable
medium
are
then
made
from
the
various
negatives
each
in
its
appropriate
tint
and
when
all
are
placed
together
and
viewed
through
transmitted
light
the
effect
of
the
picture
with
all
its
colours
combined
is
fairly
well
produced
more
serviceable
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
will
be
the
method
according
to
which
the
artist
makes
his
picture
by
transmitted
light
but
the
finished
printed
product
is
seen
on
paper
because
this
latter
lends
itself
to
the
finest
work
of
the
artistic
printer
the
principal
branch
of
the
work
of
the
photographer
must
continue
to
be
portraiture
he
can
not
greatly
reduce
the
cost
of
getting
a
really
good
negative
because
so
much
is
required
for
the
task
of
retouching
but
he
can
give
perhaps
a
hundred
prints
for
the
price
which
he
now
charges
for
a
dozen
and
make
money
by
the
enterprise
it
has
already
been
proved
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
using
expensive
salts
of
gold
silver
or
platinum
in
order
to
secure
the
most
artistic
prints
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
some
of
the
finest
art
work
in
the
photography
of
the
past
quarter
of
a
century
has
been
accomplished
with
the
cheapest
of
materials
such
as
gelatine
glue
and
lampblack
pigmented
gelatine
is
without
doubt
the
coming
medium
for
photographic
prints
and
the
methods
of
making
them
must
approximate
more
and
more
closely
to
those
of
the
typographic
printer
by
producing
a
in
gelatine
sensitised
with
bichromate
of
potash
and
afterwards
exposed
first
to
the
sun
and
then
to
the
action
of
water
an
impression
in
plastic
material
can
be
secured
from
which
with
the
use
of
warm
thin
pigmented
gelatine
a
hundred
copies
or
more
can
be
printed
off
in
a
few
minutes
the
very
general
introduction
of
such
a
process
has
naturally
been
delayed
owing
to
the
extra
trouble
involved
in
the
first
methods
which
were
suggested
for
applying
it
and
also
no
doubt
on
account
of
the
recent
fashion
for
platinotype
and
bromide
of
silver
prints
but
as
soon
as
more
convenient
details
for
the
making
of
pigmented
gelatine
prints
have
been
elaborated
the
cheapness
of
the
material
and
the
wonderful
variety
of
the
art
shades
and
tints
in
which
photographs
can
be
executed
will
give
the
gelatine
processes
an
advantage
in
the
competition
which
it
will
be
hopeless
for
other
methods
to
challenge
the
daily
newspapers
of
a
few
years
hence
will
be
vividly
illustrated
with
photographic
pictures
of
the
personages
and
the
events
of
the
day
the
gelatine
already
alluded
to
will
no
doubt
afford
the
basis
of
the
principal
processes
by
which
this
will
be
effected
hitherto
the
chief
drawback
has
been
the
difficulty
of
imparting
a
suitable
grain
to
the
printing
blocks
made
from
these
reliefs
but
this
has
been
practically
overcome
by
the
use
of
sheets
of
metallic
foil
previously
impressed
with
the
form
of
a
the
actual
printing
surface
of
course
consists
of
an
electrotype
or
stereotype
taken
from
this
photographic
face
for
printing
on
fine
paper
with
the
more
expensive
kinds
of
ink
the
zinco
processes
will
doubtless
maintain
their
supremacy
and
gradually
diminish
the
area
within
which
lithographic
printing
is
required
in
the
case
of
newspaper
work
however
where
haste
in
getting
ready
for
the
press
is
necessarily
the
prime
consideration
the
flat
and
very
surface
of
the
zinco
block
is
found
to
be
unsuited
to
the
requirements
flat
blocks
which
require
careful
overlaying
on
the
machine
waste
too
much
time
for
daily
news
work
without
going
into
technical
details
it
may
be
surmised
in
general
terms
that
in
the
near
future
almost
every
newspaper
will
contain
each
day
one
or
more
of
events
of
the
previous
day
or
of
the
news
which
has
come
to
hand
from
a
distance
by
hand
is
for
newspaper
purposes
being
so
rapidly
superseded
that
only
in
the
smaller
towns
and
villages
can
it
remain
for
even
a
few
years
longer
but
in
the
machines
by
which
this
revolution
has
been
effected
finality
has
been
by
no
means
reached
every
line
of
matter
which
appears
in
any
modern
daily
newspaper
has
to
pass
through
two
processes
of
stereotyping
before
it
makes
a
beginning
to
effect
its
final
work
of
printing
upon
paper
first
there
is
the
stereotyping
or
casting
of
the
line
in
its
position
in
the
machine
after
the
matrices
have
been
ranged
in
position
by
the
application
of
the
fingers
to
the
various
keys
and
secondly
when
all
the
lines
have
been
placed
together
to
make
a
page
it
is
necessary
to
take
an
impression
of
them
upon
or
what
is
technically
called
flong
and
then
to
dry
it
and
make
the
full
cast
from
it
curved
and
ready
for
placing
on
the
cylinder
of
the
printing
machine
the
delay
occasioned
by
the
need
for
drying
the
wet
flong
is
such
a
serious
matter
particularly
to
evening
newspapers
requiring
many
editions
during
the
afternoon
that
several
dry
methods
have
been
tried
with
greater
or
less
success
but
there
is
really
no
need
for
more
than
one
casting
process
in
the
twentieth
century
machine
the
matrices
will
be
replaced
by
permanent
type
from
which
when
ranged
in
the
line
an
impression
will
be
made
by
hard
pressure
on
a
small
bar
of
soft
metal
or
plastic
material
all
the
impressed
bars
having
been
set
together
in
a
casting
box
having
the
necessary
curvature
the
final
stereo
plate
for
printing
from
will
be
taken
at
once
by
pouring
melted
metal
on
the
combined
bars
an
appreciable
saving
both
in
time
and
in
money
will
also
be
effected
by
applying
the
principle
of
the
perforated
strip
of
paper
or
cardboard
to
the
purpose
of
operating
the
machine
by
which
the
necessary
letters
are
caused
to
range
themselves
in
the
required
order
machines
similar
to
typewriters
will
be
employed
for
perforating
the
strips
of
paper
and
for
printing
at
the
same
time
in
ordinary
letters
the
matter
just
as
if
it
were
being
typewritten
the
corrections
can
then
be
made
by
cutting
off
those
pieces
of
the
strips
which
are
wrong
and
inserting
corrected
pieces
in
their
places
no
initial
justification
to
the
space
required
to
make
a
line
is
needed
in
this
system
the
strips
however
are
put
through
the
setting
machine
and
as
they
make
the
reading
matter
by
the
impression
of
bars
as
already
described
they
are
divided
into
lines
automatically
large
numbers
of
newspapers
will
in
future
be
sold
from
machines
the
system
to
be
adopted
for
this
particular
purpose
will
doubtless
differ
in
some
important
respects
from
that
which
has
been
successful
in
the
vending
of
small
articles
such
as
sweetmeats
and
cigarettes
the
newspapers
may
be
hung
on
light
bars
within
the
machine
these
being
supported
at
the
end
by
a
cross
piece
which
on
the
insertion
of
a
penny
in
the
slot
moves
just
sufficiently
to
permit
the
end
of
one
bar
with
its
newspaper
to
drop
and
to
precipitate
the
latter
on
to
a
table
forming
the
front
of
the
machine
when
the
full
complement
of
newspapers
has
been
exhausted
the
slot
is
automatically
closed
some
of
the
newspapers
of
the
twentieth
century
will
be
given
away
gratis
and
will
be
for
the
most
part
owned
by
the
principal
advertisers
this
is
the
direction
in
which
journalistic
property
is
now
tending
and
at
any
juncture
steps
might
be
taken
in
one
or
other
of
the
great
centres
of
newspaper
enterprise
which
would
precipitate
the
ultimate
movement
hardly
any
one
who
buys
a
paper
imagines
for
a
moment
that
there
is
any
actual
profit
on
the
article
it
is
understood
on
all
hands
that
the
advertisers
keep
the
newspapers
going
and
that
the
arrangement
is
mutually
beneficial
not
that
either
party
can
dictate
to
the
other
in
matters
outside
of
its
own
province
the
effect
is
simply
to
permit
the
great
public
to
purchase
its
news
practically
for
the
price
of
the
paper
and
ink
on
which
it
is
conveyed
the
condition
being
that
the
said
public
will
permit
its
eyes
to
be
greeted
with
certain
announcements
placed
in
juxtaposition
to
the
news
and
comments
sooner
or
later
therefore
the
idea
will
occur
to
some
of
the
leading
advertisers
to
form
a
syndicate
and
give
to
the
people
a
small
broadsheet
containing
briefly
the
daily
narrative
the
ponderous
newspapers
of
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
filled
full
of
enough
of
linotype
matter
to
occupy
more
than
the
whole
day
of
the
subscriber
in
their
perusal
will
be
to
a
large
extent
dispensed
with
and
the
new
art
of
journalism
will
consist
in
saying
things
as
briefly
not
as
lengthily
as
possible
chapter

invention
and
collectivism
the
ownership
of
machinery
and
of
all
the
varied
appliances
in
the
evolution
of
which
inventive
genius
is
exercised
is
a
matter
which
strictly
speaking
does
not
belong
to
the
domain
of
this
work
nevertheless
in
endeavouring
to
forecast
the
progress
of
invention
during
the
twentieth
century
it
is
necessary
to
take
count
of
the
risks
involved
in
the
inauguration
of
any
public
and
social
economical
systems
which
might
tend
to
stifle
freedom
of
thought
and
to
discourage
the
efforts
of
those
who
have
suggestions
of
industrial
improvements
to
make
it
is
plain
that
those
economic
forces
which
prevent
the
inventor
from
having
his
ideas
tested
must
to
that
extent
retard
the
progress
of
industrial
improvement
thousands
of
men
who
imagine
that
they
possess
the
inventive
talent
in
a
highly
developed
degree
are
either
enthusiasts
or
else
utterly
unpractical
men
whose
services
would
never
be
worth
anything
at
all
in
the
work
of
attacking
difficult
mechanical
problems
it
is
in
the
task
of
discriminating
between
this
class
and
the
true
inventors
that
many
industrial
organizers
fail
any
economic
system
which
offers
inducements
to
the
directors
of
industrial
enterprises
to
shirk
the
onerous
and
at
times
very
irksome
duty
of
sifting
out
the
good
from
the
bad
must
stand
condemned
not
only
on
account
of
its
wastefulness
but
by
reason
of
its
baneful
effects
in
the
discouragement
of
inventive
genius
considerations
of
this
kind
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
during
the
twentieth
century
the
spread
of
collectivist
or
socialistic
ideas
and
the
adoption
of
methods
of
state
and
municipal
control
of
production
and
transport
may
have
an
important
bearing
upon
the
progress
of
civilisation
through
the
adoption
of
new
inventions
many
thinking
men
and
women
of
the
present
generation
are
inclined
to
believe
twentieth
century
invention
will
be
the
bringing
of
all
the
machinery
of
production
transport
and
exchange
under
the
official
control
of
persons
appointed
by
the
state
or
by
the
municipality
and
therefore
amenable
to
the
vote
of
the
people
projects
of
collectivism
are
in
the
air
and
high
hopes
are
entertained
that
the
twentieth
century
will
be
far
more
distinctively
marked
by
the
revolution
which
it
will
witness
in
the
social
and
industrial
organisation
of
the
people
than
in
the
improvements
effected
in
the
mechanical
and
other
means
for
extending
man
powers
over
natural
forces
the
average
official
naturally
wishes
to
retain
his
billet
that
is
the
main
motive
which
governs
nearly
all
his
official
acts
and
in
the
treatment
which
he
usually
accords
to
the
inventor
he
shows
this
anxiety
perhaps
more
clearly
than
in
any
other
class
of
the
actions
of
his
administration
he
wants
to
make
no
mistakes
but
whether
he
ever
scores
a
distinct
and
decided
success
is
comparatively
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
so
long
as
he
does
not
give
a
handle
to
his
enemies
to
be
used
against
him
he
is
fairly
contented
to
go
on
from
year
to
year
in
a
humdrum
style
even
a
man
of
fine
feeling
and
progressive
ideas
soon
experiences
the
numbing
effects
of
the
routine
life
after
he
has
been
a
few
years
in
office
he
knows
that
he
will
be
judged
rather
on
the
negative
than
on
the
positive
principle
that
is
to
say
for
the
things
which
it
is
accounted
he
ought
not
to
have
done
rather
than
for
the
more
enterprising
good
things
which
it
is
admitted
he
may
have
done
now
any
one
who
undertakes
to
encourage
invention
must
necessarily
make
mistakes
he
may
indeed
know
that
one
case
of
brilliant
success
will
make
up
for
half
a
dozen
comparative
failures
but
he
reckons
that
at
any
rate
the
blanks
in
the
chances
which
he
is
taking
will
numerically
exceed
the
prizes
an
official
however
will
not
dare
to
draw
blanks
better
for
him
to
draw
nothing
at
all
he
must
therefore
turn
his
back
upon
the
inventor
and
approve
of
nothing
which
has
not
been
shown
to
be
a
great
success
elsewhere
this
means
that
the
socialised
and
municipalised
enterprises
must
always
lag
behind
those
depending
upon
private
effort
and
the
country
which
imposes
disabilities
on
the
latter
must
for
a
time
at
least
lose
its
lead
in
the
industrial
race
this
is
what
happened
to
england
as
contrasted
with
the
united
states
when
under
the
influence
of
enthusiasm
for
future
municipalisation
the
british
legislature
laid
heavy
penalties
upon
those
who
should
venture
to
instal
electric
trams
in
the
united
kingdom
the
american
manufacturers
and
tramway
companies
in
their
keen
competition
with
one
another
and
perfect
freedom
to
compete
on
even
terms
with
horse
traction
soon
took
the
lead
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
electric
traction
and
the
british
public
at
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
had
to
witness
the
humiliating
spectacle
of
their
own
public
authorities
being
forced
to
import
electrical
apparatus
and
even
applicable
to
dynamos
used
for
tramway
purposes
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
the
lesson
thus
enforced
will
not
in
the
end
be
missed
although
it
may
require
a
considerable
time
to
be
fully
understood
officialism
is
a
foe
to
inventive
progress
and
whether
it
exists
under
a
regime
of
collectivism
or
under
one
of
autocracy
it
must
paralyse
industrial
enterprise
to
that
extent
thus
rendering
the
country
which
has
adopted
it
liable
to
be
outstripped
by
its
competitors
the
true
friend
of
inventive
progress
is
generally
the
rising
competitor
in
a
busy
hive
of
industry
where
the
difficulties
of
securing
a
profitable
footing
are
very
considerable
such
a
man
is
ever
on
the
watch
for
an
opportunity
to
gain
some
leverage
by
which
he
may
raise
himself
to
a
level
with
or
richer
competitors
if
he
be
a
good
employer
his
workmen
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
competition
feeling
that
promotion
will
follow
on
any
services
they
may
render
they
may
perhaps
possess
the
inventive
talent
themselves
or
they
may
do
even
greater
services
by
recognising
it
in
others
and
in
their
work
it
is
thus
that
successful
inventions
are
usually
started
on
their
useful
careers
it
is
therefore
upon
private
enterprise
that
the
principal
onus
of
advancing
the
inventions
which
will
contribute
to
the
progress
of
the
human
race
in
the
twentieth
century
must
necessarily
fall
the
type
of
man
who
will
cheerfully
work
bono
with
just
as
much
ardour
as
he
would
exhibit
when
labouring
to
advance
his
own
interests
may
already
be
found
here
and
there
in
civilised
communities
at
existing
stages
of
development
but
it
is
not
sufficiently
numerous
to
enable
the
world
to
dispense
with
the
powerful
stimulus
of
competition
just
as
a
superior
type
of
machinery
can
be
elaborated
during
the
course
of
a
single
century
there
is
no
doubt
that
mainly
through
the
use
of
improved
appliances
for
lessening
the
amount
of
brute
force
which
man
needs
to
exert
in
his
daily
avocations
the
nervous
organisations
of
the
men
and
women
constituting
the
rank
and
file
during
the
latter
part
of
the
twentieth
century
will
be
immensely
improved
in
sensitiveness
a
corresponding
advance
will
then
take
place
in
the
capacity
for
collectivism
but
a
human
being
of
the
high
class
demanded
for
the
carrying
out
of
any
scheme
of
state
socialism
must
be
bred
by
a
slow
improvement
during
successive
generations
a
hundred
years
do
not
constitute
a
long
period
of
time
in
the
process
of
the
organic
evolution
of
the
human
race
and
as
tennyson
declared
we
are
far
from
the
noon
of
man
there
is
time
for
the
race
to
grow
yet
the
public
advantages
of
collectivist
activities
in
certain
particular
directions
can
not
for
a
moment
be
denied
much
waste
and
heavy
loss
are
entailed
by
the
duplication
of
works
of
general
utility
by
rival
owners
each
of
them
perhaps
only
half
utilising
the
full
capacities
of
his
machinery
or
of
the
other
plant
upon
which
capital
has
been
expended
moreover
as
soon
as
companies
have
become
so
large
that
their
managers
and
other
officials
are
brought
into
no
closer
personal
relations
with
the
shareholders
than
the
town
clerks
engineers
and
surveyors
of
cities
and
the
departmental
heads
of
state
bureaus
are
associated
with
the
voters
and
ratepayers
the
systems
of
private
and
of
collective
ownership
begin
to
stand
much
more
nearly
on
a
par
as
regards
the
which
they
offer
to
inventiveness
one
of
the
greatest
discoveries
of
the
twentieth
century
therefore
will
be
the
adoption
of
a
which
will
admit
of
the
progressiveness
of
private
ownership
in
promoting
industrial
inventions
combined
with
the
political
progressiveness
of
collectivism
one
direction
in
which
an
important
factor
assisting
in
the
solution
of
this
problem
is
to
be
expected
is
in
the
removal
of
the
causes
which
tend
to
make
public
officials
so
timid
and
unprogressive
so
long
as
a
mere
temporary
outcry
about
the
apparent
of
some
adopted
improvement
whose
real
value
perhaps
can
not
be
proved
unless
by
the
exercise
of
patience
may
result
in
the
dismissal
or
in
the
disrating
of
the
official
who
has
recommended
it
just
so
long
will
all
those
who
are
called
upon
to
act
as
guides
to
public
enterprises
be
compelled
to
stick
to
the
most
conservative
lines
in
the
exercise
of
their
duties
more
assurance
of
permanence
in
positions
of
public
administration
is
needed
the
man
upon
whose
shoulders
rests
the
responsibility
of
adopting
or
of
condemning
new
proposals
brought
before
him
ostensibly
in
the
interests
of
the
public
welfare
ought
to
be
regarded
as
being
called
upon
to
carry
out
functions
and
his
tenure
of
office
and
his
claim
to
a
pension
after
a
busy
career
ought
not
to
depend
upon
the
chances
of
the
evanescent
politics
of
the
day
if
a
man
has
proved
by
his
close
and
successful
application
to
the
study
of
his
profession
as
evinced
in
the
tests
which
he
has
passed
as
a
youth
and
during
his
subsequent
career
in
subordinate
positions
that
he
is
really
a
lover
of
hard
work
and
imbued
with
conscientious
devotion
to
duty
he
may
generally
be
trusted
when
he
has
attained
to
a
position
of
superintendence
to
do
his
utmost
in
the
interests
of
the
public
whom
he
serves
this
is
the
theory
upon
which
the
appointment
of
a
judge
in
almost
any
community
is
understood
to
be
made
and
although
failures
in
its
application
may
occur
now
and
then
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
on
the
average
of
cases
it
works
out
well
in
practice
if
private
manufacturers
whose
success
in
life
depends
upon
their
appreciation
of
talent
and
inventiveness
could
be
assured
that
in
dealing
with
public
officials
they
would
be
brought
into
contact
with
men
of
the
standing
indicated
instead
of
being
confronted
so
frequently
with
the
demand
for
commissions
and
other
kinds
of
solatium
on
account
of
the
risks
undertaken
in
recommending
anything
new
they
would
soon
largely
modify
their
distrust
of
what
is
known
as
collectivism
it
is
the
duty
of
the
public
whose
servant
an
official
is
rather
than
of
the
private
manufacturer
to
insure
him
against
the
danger
of
losing
his
position
on
account
of
any
possible
mistake
in
the
exercise
of
his
judgment
in
short
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
the
men
upon
whom
devolves
the
responsibility
of
examining
into
and
reporting
upon
the
claims
of
those
who
profess
to
have
made
important
industrial
improvements
will
be
looked
upon
as
exercising
judicial
functions
of
the
very
highest
type
when
the
important
reforms
arising
from
this
recognition
have
been
introduced
the
forces
of
collectivism
will
cease
to
range
themselves
on
the
side
of
stolid
conservatism
in
industry
as
they
undoubtedly
have
done
in
the
nineteenth
century
even
while
they
inconsistently
professed
to
advance
the
cause
of
progress
politically
the
inventor
who
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
generally
denounced
as
a
public
enemy
will
in
the
latter
part
of
the
twentieth
century
be
hailed
as
a
benefactor
to
the
community
because
he
will
be
judged
by
the
ultimate
rather
than
by
the
immediate
effects
of
his
work
and
because
it
will
be
the
duty
of
the
public
authorities
to
see
to
it
that
the
dislocation
of
one
industry
incidental
the
promotion
of
another
by
any
invention
does
not
on
the
whole
operate
to
throw
people
out
of
employment
but
on
the
contrary
gives
more
constant
work
and
better
wages
to
all
but
the
slow
progress
of
the
fundamental
traits
of
human
nature
will
retard
the
attainment
of
this
goal
the
world
has
a
long
distance
to
travel
in
the
uphill
road
of
industrial
and
social
improvement
before
it
can
succeed
in
obtaining
a
really
true
view

the
part
