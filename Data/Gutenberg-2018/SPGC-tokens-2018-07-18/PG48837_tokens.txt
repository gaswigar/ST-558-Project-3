a

the
extent
and
purpose
of
this
work
have
in
the
course
of
its
progress
gradually
but
essentially
changed
from
what
the
author
originally
proposed
it
was
at
first
intended
merely
as
a
brief
and
popular
abstract
of
the
life
of
the
most
wonderful
man
and
the
most
extraordinary
events
of
the
last
thirty
years
in
short
to
emulate
the
concise
yet
most
interesting
history
of
the
great
british
admiral
by
the
of
britain
the
author
was
partly
induced
to
undertake
the
task
by
having
formerly
drawn
up
for
a
periodical
work
the
edinburgh
annual
register
the
history
of
the
two
great
campaigns
of
and
and
three
volumes
were
the
compass
assigned
to
the
proposed
work
an
introductory
volume
giving
a
general
account
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
french
revolution
was
thought
necessary
and
the
single
volume
on
a
theme
of
such
extent
soon
swelled
into
two
as
the
author
composed
under
an
anonymous
title
he
could
neither
seek
nor
expect
information
from
those
who
had
been
actively
engaged
in
the
changeful
scenes
which
he
was
attempting
to
record
nor
was
his
object
more
ambitious
than
that
of
compressing
and
arranging
such
information
as
the
ordinary
authorities
afforded
circumstances
however
unconnected
with
the
undertaking
induced
him
to
lay
aside
an
any
farther
attempt
to
preserve
which
must
have
been
considered
as
affectation
and
since
his
having
done
so
he
has
been
favoured
with
access
to
some
valuable
materials
most
of
which
have
now
for
the
first
time
seen
the
light
for
these
he
refers
to
the
appendix
at
the
close
of
the
work
where
the
reader
will
find
several
articles
of
novelty
and
interest
though
not
at
liberty
in
every
case
to
mention
the
quarter
from
which
his
information
has
been
derived
the
author
has
been
careful
not
to
rely
upon
any
which
did
not
come
from
sufficient
authority
he
has
neither
grubbed
for
anecdotes
in
the
libels
and
private
scandal
of
the
time
nor
has
he
solicited
information
from
individuals
who
could
not
be
impartial
witnesses
in
the
facts
to
which
they
gave
evidence
yet
the
various
public
documents
and
private
information
which
he
has
received
have
much
enlarged
his
stock
of
materials
and
increased
the
whole
work
to
more
than
twice
the
size
originally
intended
on
the
execution
of
his
task
it
becomes
the
author
to
be
silent
he
is
aware
it
must
exhibit
many
faults
but
he
claims
credit
for
having
brought
to
the
undertaking
a
mind
disposed
to
do
his
subject
as
impartial
justice
as
his
judgment
could
supply
he
will
be
found
no
enemy
to
the
person
of
napoleon
the
term
of
hostility
is
ended
when
the
battle
has
been
won
and
the
foe
exists
no
longer
his
splendid
personal
qualities
his
great
military
actions
and
political
services
to
france
will
not
it
is
hoped
be
found
depreciated
in
the
narrative
unhappily
the
author
task
involved
a
duty
of
another
kind
the
discharge
of
which
is
due
to
france
to
britain
to
europe
and
to
the
world
if
the
general
system
of
napoleon
has
rested
upon
force
or
fraud
it
is
neither
the
greatness
of
his
talents
nor
the
success
of
his
undertakings
that
ought
to
stifle
the
voice
or
dazzle
the
eyes
of
him
who
adventures
to
be
his
historian
the
reasons
however
are
carefully
summed
up
where
the
author
has
presumed
to
express
a
favourable
or
unfavourable
opinion
of
the
distinguished
person
of
whom
these
volumes
treat
so
that
each
reader
may
judge
of
their
validity
for
himself
the
name
by
an
original
error
of
the
press
which
proceeded
too
far
before
it
was
discovered
has
been
printed
with
a
buonaparte
instead
of
bonaparte
both
spellings
were
indifferently
adopted
in
the
family
but
napoleon
always
used
the
last
and
had
an
unquestionable
right
to
choose
the
orthography
which
he
preferred

says
goëthe
passed
his
childhood
among
the
stirring
scenes
of
the
american
war
and
was
a
youth
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
when
the
french
revolution
broke
out
now
well
advanced
in
the
fifties
having
all
along
been
favourably
placed

twenty

conversed
with
paoli
in

year
of
my
age
and
with
napoleon
himself
in
the
sixtieth
through
that
long
series
of
years
coming
more
or
less
into
contact
with
the
great
doings
of
the
world
i
failed
not
to
think
seriously
on
what
was
passing
around
me
and
after
my
own
fashion
to
connect
so
many
extraordinary
mutations
into
something
like
arrangement
and
interdependence
what
could
now
be
more
delightful
to
me
than
leisurely
and
calmly
to
sit
down
and
listen
to
the
discourse
of
such
a
man
while
clearly
truly
and
with
all
the
skill
of
a
great
artist
he
recalls
to
me

incidents
on

through

for

from

was
before

in

ears
we
were
scarce

state
of
things
before
its
rage
commenced
and
when
subsequently
the
deluge
has
subsided
within
the
natural
limits
of
the
stream
it
is
still
more
difficult
to
recollect
with
precision
the
terrors
it
inspired
when
at
its
height
that
which
is
present
possesses
such
power
over
our
senses
and
our
imagination
that
it
requires
no
common
effort
to
recall
those
sensations
which
expired
with
preceding
events
yet
to
do
this
is
the
peculiar
province
of

of

sidenote
state

the
peace
concluded
at

in
was

to
augur
a

repose
to
europe
the
high
and
emulous
tone
assumed
in
former
times
by
the
rival
nations
had
been
lowered
and
tamed
by
recent
circumstances
england
under
the
guidance
of
a
weak
at
least
a
most
unlucky
administration
had
purchased
peace
at
the
expense
of
her
north
american
empire
and
the
resignation
of
supremacy
over
her
colonies
a
loss
great
in
itself
but
exaggerated
in
the
eyes
of
the
nation
by
the
rending
asunder
of
the
ties
of
common
descent
and
exclusive
commercial
intercourse
and
by
a
sense
of
the
wars
waged
and
expenses
encountered
for
the
protection
and
advancement
of
the
fair
empire
which
england
found
herself
obliged
to
surrender
the
lustre
of
the
british
arms
so
brilliant
at
the
peace
of
fontainbleau
had
been
tarnished
if
not
extinguished
in
spite
of
the
gallant
defence
of
gibraltar
the
general
result
of
the
war
on
land
had
been
unfavourable
to
her
military
reputation
and
notwithstanding
the
opportune
and
splendid
victories
of
rodney
the
coasts
of
britain
had
been
insulted
and
her
fleets
compelled
to
retire
into
port
while
those
of
her
combined
enemies
rode
masters
of
the
channel
the
spirit
of
the
country
also
had
been
lowered
by
the
unequal
contest
which
had
been
sustained
and
by
the
sense
that
her
naval
superiority
was
an
object
of
invidious
hatred
to
united
europe
this
had
been
lately
made
manifest
by
the
armed
alliance
of
the
northern
nations
which
though
termed
a
neutrality
was
in
fact
a
league
made
to
abate
the
pretensions
of
england
to
maritime
supremacy
there
are
to
be
added
to
these
disheartening
and
depressing
circumstances
the
decay
of
commerce
during
the
long
course
of
hostilities
with
the
want
of
credit
and
depression
of
the
price
of
land
which
are
the
usual
consequences
of
a
transition
from
war
to
peace
ere
capital
has
regained
its
natural
channel
all
these
things
being
considered
it
appeared
the
manifest
interest
of
england
to
husband
her
exhausted
resources
and
recruit
her
diminished
wealth
by
cultivating
peace
and
tranquillity
for
a
long
course
of
time
william
pitt
never
more
distinguished
than
in
his
financial
operations
was
engaged
in
new
modelling
the
revenue
of
the
country
and
adding
to
the
return
of
the
taxes
while
he
diminished
their
pressure
it
could
scarcely
be
supposed
that
any
object
of
national
ambition
would
have
been
permitted
to
disturb
him
in
a
task
so
necessary
neither
had
france
the
natural
rival
of
england
come
off
from
the
contest
in
such
circumstances
of
triumph
and
advantage
as
were
likely
to
encourage
her
to
a
speedy
renewal
of
the
struggle
it
is
true
she
had
seen
and
contributed
to
the
humiliation
of
her
ancient
enemy
but
she
had
paid
dearly
for
the
gratification
of
her
revenge
as
nations
and
individuals
are
wont
to
do
her
finances
tampered
with
by
successive
sets
of
ministers
who
looked
no
farther
than
to
temporary
expedients
for
carrying
on
the
necessary
expenses
of
government
now
presented
an
alarming
prospect
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
wildest
and
most
enterprising
ministers
would
hardly
have
dared
in
their
most
sanguine
moments
to
have
recommended
either
war
itself
or
any
measures
of
which
war
might
be
the
consequence
spain
was
in
a
like
state
of
exhaustion
she
had
been
hurried
into
the
alliance
against
england
partly
by
the
consequences
of
the
family
alliance
betwixt
her
bourbons
and
those
of
france
but
still
more
by
the
eager
and
engrossing
desire
to
possess
herself
once
more
of
gibraltar
the
castilian
pride
long
galled
by
beholding
this
important
fortress
in
the
hands
of
heretics
and
foreigners
highly
applauded
the
war
which
gave
a
chance
of
its
recovery
and
seconded
with
all
the
power
of
the
kingdom
the
gigantic
efforts
made
for
that
purpose
all
these
immense
preparations
with
the
most
formidable
means
of
attack
ever
used
on
such
an
occasion
had
totally
failed
and
the
kingdom
of
spain
remained
at
once
stunned
and
mortified
by
the
failure
and
broken
down
by
the
expenses
of
so
huge
an
undertaking
an
attack
upon
algiers
in
tended
to
exhaust
the
remains
of
her
military
ardour
spain
therefore
relapsed
into
inactivity
and
repose
dispirited
by
the
miscarriage
of
her
favourite
scheme
and
possessing
neither
the
means
nor
the
audacity
necessary
to
meditate
its
speedy
renewal
neither
were
the
sovereigns
of
the
late
belligerent
powers
of
that
ambitious
and
active
character
which
was
likely
to
drag
the
kingdoms
which
they
swayed
into
the
renewal
of
hostilities
the
classic
eye
of
the
historian
gibbon
saw
arcadius
and
honorius
the
weakest
and
most
indolent
of
the
roman
emperors
slumbering
upon
the
thrones
of
the
house
of
bourbon
and
the
just
and
loyal
character
of
george
iii
precluded
any
effort
on
his
part
to
undermine
the
peace
which
he
signed
unwillingly
or
to
attempt
the
resumption
of
those
rights
which
he
had
formally
though
reluctantly
surrendered
his
expression
to
the
ambassador
of
the
united

was
a
trait
of
character
never
to
be

or
forgotten

i

now
it
is
made
to
resist
any

the
acute
historian
whom
we
have
already
quoted
seems
to
have
apprehended
in
the
character
and
ambition
of
the
northern
potentates
those
causes
of
disturbance
which
were
not
to
be
found
in
the
western
part
of
the
european
republic
but
catherine
the
semiramis
of
the
north
had
her
views
of
extensive
dominion
chiefly
turned
towards
her
eastern
and
southern
frontier
and
the
finances
of
her
immense
but
comparatively
poor
and
unpeopled
empire
were
burdened
with
the
expenses
of
a
luxurious
court
requiring
at
once
to
be
gratified
with
the
splendour
of
asia
and
the
refinements
of
europe
the
strength
of
her
empire
also
though
immense
was
unwieldy
and
the
empire
had
not
been
uniformly
fortunate
in
its
wars
with
the
more
prompt
though
less
numerous
armies
of
the
king
of
prussia
her
neighbour
thus
russia
no
less
than
other
powers
in
europe
appeared
more
desirous
of
reposing
her
gigantic
strength
than
of
adventuring
upon
new
and
hazardous
conquests
even
her
views
upon
turkey
which
circumstances
seemed
to
render
more
flattering
than
ever
she
was
contented
to
resign
in
when
only
half
accomplished
a
pledge
not
only
that
her
thoughts
were
sincerely
bent
upon
peace
but
that
she
felt
the
necessity
of
resisting
even
the
most
tempting
opportunities
for
resuming
the
course
of
victory
which
she
had
four
years
before
pursued

successfully

himself
who
had
been
so
long
by
dint
of
genius
and
talent
the
animating
soul
of
the
political
intrigues
in
europe
had
run
too
many
risks
in
the
course
of
his
adventurous
and
eventful
reign
to
be
desirous
of
encountering
new
hazards
in
the
extremity
of

his
empire
extended
as
it
was
from
the
shores
of
the
baltic
to
the
frontiers
of

consisted
of
various
detached
portions
which
it
required
the
aid
of
time
to
consolidate
into
a
single
kingdom
and
accustomed
to
study
the
signs
of
the
times
it
could
not
have
escaped
frederick
that
sentiments
and
feelings
were
afloat
connected
with
and
fostered
by
the
spirit
of
unlimited
investigation
which
he
himself
had
termed
philosophy
such
as
might
soon
call
upon
the
sovereigns
to
arm
in
a
common
cause
and
ought
to
prevent
them
in
the
meanwhile
from
wasting
their
strength
in
mutual
struggles
and
giving
advantage
to
a
common
enemy
if
such
anticipations
occupied
and
agitated
the
last
years
of
frederick
life
they
had
not
the
same
effect
upon
the
emperor
joseph
who
without
the
same
precision
of
judgment
endeavoured
to
tread
in
the
steps
of
the
king
of
prussia
as
a
reformer
and
as
a
conqueror
it
would
be
unjust
to
deny
to
this
prince
the
praise
of
considerable
talents
and
inclination
to
employ
them
for
the
good
of
the
country
which
he
ruled
but
it
frequently
happens
that
the
talents
and
even
the
virtues
of
sovereigns
exercised
without
respect
to
time
and
circumstances
become
the
misfortune
of
their
government
it
is
particularly
the
lot
of
princes
endowed
with
such
personal
advantages
to
be
confident
in
their
own
abilities
and
unless
educated
in
the
severe
school
of
adversity
to
prefer
favourites
who
assent
to
and
repeat
their
opinions
to
independent
counsellors
whose
experience
might
correct
their
own
hasty
conclusions
and
thus
although
the
personal
merits
of
joseph
ii
were
in
every
respect
acknowledged
his
talents
in
a
great
measure
recognised
and
his
patriotic
intentions
scarcely
disputable
it
fell
to
his
lot
during
the
period
we
treat
of
to
excite
more
apprehension
and
discontent
among
his
subjects
than
if
he
had
been
a
prince
content
to
rule
by
a
minister
and
wear
out
an
indolent
life
in
the
forms
and
pleasures
of

court

of

schemes
of
reform
too
hastily
adopted
or
at
least
too
incautiously
and
peremptorily
executed
had
the
misfortune
to
introduce
fearful
commotions
among
the
people
whose
situation
he
meant
to
ameliorate
while
in
his
external
relations
he
rendered
austria
the
quarter
from
which
a
breach
of
european
peace
was
most
to
be
apprehended
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
the
emperor
had
contrived
to
reconcile
his
philosophical
professions
with
the
exercise
of
the
most
selfish
policy
towards
the
united
provinces
both
in
opening
the
scheldt
and
in
dismantling
the
barrier
towns
which
had
been
placed
in
their
hands
as
a
defence
against
the
power
of
france
by
the
first
of
these
measures
the
emperor
gained
nothing
but
the
paltry
sum
of
money
for
which
he
sold
his
pretensions
and
the
shame
of
having
shown
himself
ungrateful
for
the
important
services
which
the
united
provinces
had
rendered
to
his
ancestors
but
the
dismantling
of
the
dutch
barrier
was
subsequently
attended
by
circumstances
alike
calamitous
to
austria
and
to
the
whole
continent
of
europe
in
another
respect
the
reforms
carried
through
by
joseph
ii
tended
to
prepare
the
public
mind
for
future
innovations
made
with
a
ruder
hand
and
upon
a
much
larger
scale
the
suppression
of
the
religious
orders
and
the
appropriation
of
their
revenues
to
the
general
purposes
of
government
had
in
it
something
to
flatter
the
feelings
of
those
of
the
reformed
religion
but
in
a
moral
point
of
view
the
seizing
upon
the
property
of
any
private
individual
or
public
body
is
an
invasion
of
the
most
sacred
principles
of
public
justice
and
such
spoliation
can
not
be
vindicated
by
urgent
circumstances
of
or
any
plausible
pretext
of
whatsoever
since
no
necessity
can
vindicate
what
is
in
itself
unjust
and
no
public
advantage
can
compensate
a
breach
of
public
faith
joseph
was
also
the
first
catholic
sovereign
who
broke
through
the
solemn
degree
of
reverence
attached
by
that
religion
to
the
person
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
the
pope
fruitless
and
humiliating
visit
to
vienna
furnished
the
shadow
of
a
precedent
for
the
conduct
of
napoleon
to
pius
vii
another
and
yet
less
justifiable
cause
of
innovation
placed
in
peril
and
left
in
doubt
and
discontent
some
of
the
fairest
provinces
of
the
austrian
dominions
and
those
which
the
wisest
of
their
princes
had
governed
with
peculiar
tenderness
and
moderation
the
austrian
netherlands
had
been
in
a
literal
sense
dismantled
and
left
open
to
the
first
invader
by
the
demolition
of
the
barrier
fortresses
and
it
seems
to
have
been
the
systematic
purpose
of
the
emperor
to
eradicate
and
destroy
that
love
and
regard
for
their
prince
and
his
government
which
in
time
of
need
proves
the
most
effectual
moral
substitute
for
moats
and
ramparts
the
history
of
the
house
of
burgundy
bore
witness
on
every
page
to
the
love
of
the
flemings
for
liberty
and
the
jealousy
with
which
they
have
from
the
earliest
ages
watched
the
privileges
they
had
obtained
from
their
princes
yet
in
that
country
and
amongst
these
people
joseph
carried
on
his
measures
of
innovation
with
a
hand
so
unsparing
as
if
he
meant
to
bring
the
question
of
liberty
or
arbitrary
power
to
a
very
brief
and
military
decision
betwixt
him
and
his
subjects
sidenote
flemish
disturbances
his
alterations
were
not
in
flanders
as
elsewhere
confined
to
the
ecclesiastical
state
alone
although
such
innovations
were
peculiarly
offensive
to
a
people
rigidly
catholic
but
were
extended
through
the
most
important
parts
of
the
civil
government
changes
in
the
courts
of
justice
were
threatened
the
great
seal
which
had
hitherto
remained
with
the
chancellor
of
the
states
was
transferred
to
the
imperial
minister
a
council
of
state
composed
of
commissioners
nominated
by
the
emperor
was
appointed
to
discharge
the
duties
hitherto
intrusted
to
a
standing
committee
of
the
states
of
brabant
their
universities
were
altered
and
and
their
magistrates
subjected
to
arbitrary
arrests
and
sent
to
vienna
instead
of
being
tried
in
their
own
country
and
by
their
own
laws
the
flemish
people
beheld
these
innovations
with
the
sentiments
natural
to
freemen
and
not
a
little
stimulated
certainly
by
the
scenes
which
had
lately
passed
in
north
america
where
under
circumstances
of
far
less
provocation
a
large
empire
had
emancipated
itself
from
the
mother
country
the
states
remonstrated
loudly
and
refused
submission
to
the
decrees
which
encroached
on
their
constitutional
liberties
and
at
length
arrayed
a
military
force
in
support
of
their
patriotic
opposition
joseph
who
at
the
same
time
he
thus
wantonly
provoked
the
states
and
people
of
flanders
had
been
seduced
by
russia
to
join
her
ambitious
plan
upon
turkey
bent
apparently
before
the
storm
he
had
excited
and
for
a
time
yielded
to
accommodation
with
his
subjects
of
flanders
renounced
the
most
obnoxious
of
his
new
measures
and
confirmed
the
privileges
of
the
nation
at
what
was
called
the
joyous
entry
but
this
spirit
of
conciliation
was
only
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
deception
for
so
soon
as
he
had
assembled
in
flanders
what
was
deemed
a
sufficient
armed
force
to
sustain
his
despotic
purposes
the
emperor
threw
off
the
mask
and
by
the
most
violent
acts
of
military
force
endeavoured
to
overthrow
the
constitution
he
had
agreed
to
observe
and
to
enforce
the
arbitrary
measures
which
he
had
pretended
to
abandon
for
a
brief
period
of
two
years
flanders
remained
in
a
state
of
suppressed
but
and
discontent
watching
for
a
moment
favourable
to
freedom
and
to
vengeance
it
proved
an
ample
of
combustibles
prompt
to
catch
fire
as
the
flame
now
arising
in
france
began
to
expand
itself
nor
can
it
be
doubted
that
the
condition
of
the
flemish
provinces
whether
considered
in
a
military
or
in
a
political
light
was
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
the
subsequent
success
of
the
french
republican
arms
joseph
himself
and
dispirited
died
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
troubles
he
had
wantonly
provoked
desirous
of
fame
as
a
legislator
and
a
warrior
and
certainly
born
with
talents
to
acquire
it
he
left
his
arms
dishonoured
by
the
successes
of
the
despised
turks
and
his
fair
dominions
of
the
netherlands
and
of
hungary
upon
the
very
eve
of
insurrection
a
lampoon
written
upon
the
hospital
for
lunatics
at
vienna
might
be
said
to
be
no
unjust
epitaph
for
a
monarch
one
so
hopeful
and
so
beloved
josephus
ubique
secundus
hic
primus
these
flemish
disturbances
might
be
regarded
as
symptoms
of
the
new
opinions
which
were
tacitly
gaining
ground
in
europe
and
which
preceded
the
grand
explosion
as
slight
shocks
of
an
earthquake
usually
announce
the
approach
of
its
general
convulsion
the
like
may
be
said
of
the
dutch
revolution
of
in
which
the
ancient
faction
of
louvestein
under
the
encouragement
of
france
for
a
time
completely
triumphed
over
that
of
the
stadtholder
deposed
him
from
his
hereditary
command
of
of
the
army
of
the
states
and
reduced
or
endeavoured
to
reduce
the
confederation
of
the
united
states
to
a
pure
democracy
this
was
also
a
strong
sign
of
the
times
for
although
totally
opposite
to
the
inclination
of
the
majority
of
the
of
the
equestrian
body
of
the
landed
proprietors
nay
of
the
very
populace
most
of
whom
were
from
habit
and
principle
attached
to
the
house
of
orange
the
burghers
of
the
large
towns
drove
on
the
work
of
revolution
with
such
warmth
of
zeal
and
promptitude
of
action
as
showed
a
great
part
of
the
middling
classes
to
be
deeply
tinctured
with
the
desire
of
gaining
further
liberty
and
a
larger
share
in
the
legislation
and
administration
of
the
country
than
pertained
to
them
under
the
old
oligarchical
constitution
the
revolutionary
government
in
the
dutch
provinces
did
not
however
conduct
their
affairs
with
prudence
without
waiting
to
organize
their
own
force
or
weaken
that
of
the
enemy
without
obtaining
the
necessary
countenance
and
protection
of
france
or
with
the
malecontents
in
the
austrian
netherlands
they
gave
by
arresting
the
princess
of
orange
sister
of
the
king
of
prussia
an
opportunity
of
foreign
interference
of
which
that
prince
failed
not
to
avail

armies

by
the
duke
of
brunswick

into
the

with
little
difficulty
possessed
themselves
of

and
the
other
cities
which
constituted
the
strength
of
the
louvestein
or
republican
faction
the

replaced
the

of
orange
in
all
its
power

and
functions
the
conduct
of
the
dutch
republicans
during
their
brief
hour
of
authority
had
been
neither
so
moderate
nor
so
popular
as
to
make
their
sudden
and
almost
unresisting
fall
a
matter
of
general
regret
on
the
contrary
it
was
considered
as
a
probable
pledge
of
the
continuance
of
peace
in
europe
especially
as
france
busied
with
her
own
affairs
declined
interference
in
those
of
the
united
states
sidenote
intrigues
of
russia
the
intrigues
of
russia
had
in
accomplishment
of
the
ambitious
schemes
of
catherine
lighted
up
war
with
sweden
as
well
as
with
turkey
but
in
both
cases
hostilities
were
commenced
upon
the
old
plan
of
fighting
one
or
two
battles
and
wresting
a
fortress
of
a
province
from
a
neighbouring
state
and
it
seems
likely
that
the
intervention
of
france
and
england
equally
interested
in
preserving
the
balance
of
power
might
have
ended
these
troubles
but
for
the
progress
of
that
great
and
hitherto
course
of
events
which
prepared
carried
on
and
matured
the
french
revolution
it
is
necessary
for
the
execution
of
our
plan
that
we
should
review
this
period
of
history
the
most
important
perhaps
during
its
currency
and
in
its
consequences
which
the
annals
of
mankind
afford
and
although
the
very
title
is
sufficient
to
awaken
in
most
bosoms
either
horror
or
admiration
yet
neither
insensible
of
the
blessings
of
national
liberty
nor
of
those
which
flow
from
the
protection
of
just
laws
and
a
moderate
but
firm
executive
government
we
may
perhaps
be
enabled
to
trace
its
events
with
the
candour
of
one
who
looking
back
on
past
scenes
feels
divested
of
the
keen
and
angry
spirit
with
which
in
common
with
his
contemporaries
he
may
have
judged
them
while
they
were
yet
in
progress
we
have
shortly
reviewed
the
state
of
europe
in
general
which
we
have
seen
to
be
either
pacific
or
disturbed
by
troubles
of
no
long
duration
but
it
was
in
france
that
a
thousand
circumstances
some
arising
out
of
the
general
history
of
the
world
some
peculiar
to
that
country
herself
mingled
like
the
ingredients
in
the
witches
cauldron
to
produce
in
succession
many
a
formidable
but
passing
apparition
until
concluded
by
the
stern
vision
of
absolute
and
military
power
as
those
in
the
drama
are
introduced
by
that
of
the
armed
head
the
first
and
most
effective
cause
of
the
revolution
was
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
feelings
of
the
french
towards
their
government
and
the
monarch
who
was
its
head
the
devoted
loyalty
of
the
people
to
their
king
had
been
for
several
ages
the
most
marked
characteristic
of
the
nation
it
was
their
honour
in
their
own
eyes
and
matter
of
contempt
and
ridicule
in
those
of
the
english
because
it
seemed
in
its
excess
to
swallow
up
all
ideas
of
patriotism
that
very
excess
of
loyalty
however
was
founded
not
on
a
servile
but
upon
a
generous
principle
france
is
ambitious
fond
of
military
glory
and
willingly
identifies
herself
with
the
fame
acquired
by
her
soldiers
down
to
the
reign
of
louis
the
french
monarch
was
in
the
eyes
of
his
subjects
a
general
and
the
whole
people
an
army
an
army
must
be
under
severe
discipline
and
a
general
must
possess
absolute
power
but
the
soldier
feels
no
degradation
from
the
restraint
which
is
necessary
to
his
profession
and
without
which
he
can
not
be
led
to
conquest
sidenote
french
monarchy
every
true
frenchman
therefore
submitted
without
scruple
to
that
abridgement
of
personal
liberty
which
appeared
necessary
to
render
the
monarch
great
and
france
victorious
the
king
according
to
this
system
was
regarded
less
as
an
individual
than
as
the
representative
of
the
concentrated
honour
of
the
kingdom
and
in
this
sentiment
however
extravagant
and
quixotic
there
mingled
much
that
was
generous
patriotic
and
disinterested
the
same
feeling
was
awakened
after
all
the
changes
of
the
revolution
by
the
wonderful
successes
of
the
individual
of
whom
the
future
volumes
are
to
treat
and
who
transferred
in
many
instances
to
his
own
person
by
deeds
almost
exceeding
credibility
the
species
of
devoted
attachment
with
which
france
formerly
regarded
the
ancient
line
of
her
kings
the
nobility
shared
with
the
king
in
the
advantages
which
this
predilection
spread
around
him
if
the
monarch
was
regarded
as
the
chief
ornament
of
the
community
they
were
the
minor
gems
by
whose
lustre
that
of
the
crown
was
relieved
or
adorned
if
he
was
the
supreme
general
of
the
state
they
were
the
officers
attached
to
his
person
and
necessary
to
the
execution
of
his
commands
each
in
his
degree
bound
to
advance
the
honour
and
glory
of
the
common
country
when
such
sentiments
were
at
their
height
there
could
be
no
murmuring
against
the
peculiar
privileges
of
the
nobility
any
more
than
against
the
almost
absolute
authority
of
the
monarch
each
had
that
rank
in
the
state
which
was
regarded
as
his
and
for
one
of
the
lower
orders
to
repine
that
he
enjoyed
not
the
immunities
peculiar
to
the
noblesse
would
have
been
as
unavailing
and
as
foolish
as
to
lament
that
he
was
not
born
to
an
independent
estate
thus
the
frenchman
contented
though
with
an
illusion
laughed
danced
and
indulged
all
the
gaiety
of
his
national
character
in
circumstances
under
which
his
insular
neighbours
would
have
thought
the
slightest
token
of
patience
dishonourable
and
degrading
the
distress
or
privation
which
the
french
plebeian
suffered
in
his
own
person
was
made
up
to
him
in
imagination
by
his
interest
in
the
national
glory
was
a
citizen
of
paris
postponed
in
rank
to
the
lowest
military
officer
he
consoled
himself
by
reading
the
victories
of
the
french
arms
in
the
gazette
and
was
he
unduly
and
unequally
taxed
to
support
the
expense
of
the
crown
still
the
public
feasts
which
were
given
and
the
palaces
which
were
built
were
to
him
a
source
of
compensation
he
looked
on
at
the
carousal
he
admired
the
splendour
of
versailles
and
enjoyed
a
reflected
share
of
their
splendour
in
recollecting
that
they
displayed
the
magnificence
of
his
country
this
state
of
things
however
illusory
seemed
while
the
illusion
lasted
to
realize
the
wish
of
those
legislators
who
have
endeavoured
to
form
a
general
fund
of
national
happiness
from
which
each
individual
is
to
draw
his
personal
share
of
enjoyment
if
the
monarch
enjoyed
the
display
of
his
own
grace
and
agility
while
he
hunted
or
rode
at
the
ring
the
spectators
had
their
share
of
pleasure
in
witnessing
it
if
louis
had
the
satisfaction
of
beholding
the
splendid
piles
of
versailles
and
the
louvre
arise
at
his
command
the
subject
admired
them
when
raised
and
his
real
portion
of
pleasure
was
not
perhaps
inferior
to
that
of
the
founder
the
people
were
like
men
inconveniently
placed
in
a
crowded
theatre
who
think
little
of
the
personal
inconveniences
they
are
subjected
to
by
the
heat
and
pressure
while
their
mind
is
engrossed
by
the
splendours
of
the
representation
in
short
not
only
the
political
opinions
of
frenchmen
but
their
actual
feelings
were
in
the
earlier
days
of
the
eighteenth
century
expressed
in
the
motto
which
they
chose
for
their
national
palace
earth
hath
no
nation
like
the
french
no
nation
a
city
like
paris
or
a
king
like
louis
the
french
enjoyed
this
assumed
superiority
with
the
less
chance
of
being
undeceived
that
they
listened
not
to
any
voice
from
other
lands
which
pointed
out
the
deficiencies
in
the
frame
of
government
under
which
they
lived
or
which
hinted
the
superior
privileges
enjoyed
by
the
subjects
of
a
more
free
state
the
intense
love
of
our
own
country
and
admiration
of
its
constitution
is
usually
accompanied
with
a
contempt
or
dislike
of
foreign
states
and
their
modes
of
government
the
french
in
the
reign
of
louis
enamoured
of
their
own
institutions
regarded
those
of
other
nations
as
unworthy
of
their
consideration
and
if
they
paused
for
a
moment
to
gaze
on
the
complicated
constitution
of
their
great
rival
it
was
soon
dismissed
as
a
subject
totally
unintelligible
with
some
expression
of
pity
perhaps
for
the
poor
sovereign
who
had
the
ill
luck
to
preside
over
a
government
embarrassed
by
so
many
restraints
and
limitations
yet
into
whatever
political
errors
the
french
people
were
led
by
the
excess
of
their
loyalty
it
would
be
unjust
to
brand
them
as
a
nation
of
a
mean
and
slavish
spirit
servitude
infers
dishonour
and
dishonour
to
a
frenchman
is
the
last
of
evils
burke
more
justly
regarded
them
as
a
people
misled
to
their
disadvantage
by
high
and
romantic
ideas
of
honour
and
fidelity
and
who
actuated
by
a
principle
of
public
spirit
in
their
submission
to
their
monarch
worshipped
in
his
person
the
fortune
of
france
their
common
country
during
the
reign
of
louis
every
thing
tended
to
support
the
sentiment
which
connected
the
national
honour
with
the
wars
and
undertakings
of
the
king
his
success
in
the
earlier
years
of
his
reign
was
splendid
and
he
might
be
regarded
for
many
years
as
the
dictator
of
europe
during
this
period
the
universal
opinion
of
his
talents
together
with
his
successes
abroad
and
his
magnificence
at
home
fostered
the
idea
that
the
grand
monarque
was
in
himself
the
tutelar
deity
and
only
representative
of
the
great
nation
whose
powers
he
wielded
sorrow
and
desolation
came
on
his
latter
years
but
be
it
said
to
the
honour
of
the
french
people
that
the
devoted
allegiance
they
had
paid
to
louis
in
prosperity
was
not
withdrawn
when
fortune
seemed
to
have
turned
her
back
upon
her
original
favourite
france
poured
her
youth
forth
as
readily
if
not
so
gaily
to
repair
the
defeats
of
her
monarch
old
age
as
she
had
previously
yielded
them
to
secure
and
extend
the
victories
of
his
early
reign
louis
had
perfectly
succeeded
in
establishing
the
crown
as
the
sole
pivot
upon
which
public
affairs
turned
and
in
attaching
to
his
person
as
the
representative
of
france
all
the
importance
which
in
other
countries
is
given
to
the
great
body
of
the
nation
nor
had
the
spirit
of
the
french
monarchy
in
surrounding
itself
with
all
the
dignity
of
absolute
power
failed
to
secure
the
support
of
those
auxiliaries
which
have
the
most
extended
influence
upon
the
public
mind
by
engaging
at
once
religion
and
literature
in
defence
of
its
authority
the
gallican
church
more
dependent
upon
the
monarch
and
less
so
upon
the
pope
than
is
usual
in
catholic
countries
gave
to
the
power
of
the
crown
all
the
mysterious
and
supernatural
terrors
annexed
to
an
origin
in
divine
right
and
directed
against
those
who
encroached
on
the
limits
of
the
royal
prerogative
or
even
ventured
to
scrutinize
too
minutely
the
foundation
of
its
authority
the
penalties
annexed
to
a
breach
of
the
divine
law
louis
xiv
repaid
this
important
service
by
a
constant
and
even
scrupulous
attention
to
observances
prescribed
by
the
church
which
strengthened
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
the
alliance
so
strictly
formed
betwixt
the
altar
and
the
throne
those
who
look
to
the
private
morals
of
the
monarch
may
indeed
form
some
doubt
of
the
sincerity
of
his
religious
professions
considering
how
little
they
influenced
his
practice
and
yet
when
we
reflect
upon
the
frequent
inconsistencies
of
mankind
in
this
particular
we
may
hesitate
to
charge
with
hypocrisy
a
conduct
which
was
dictated
perhaps
as
much
by
conscience
as
by
political
convenience
even
judging
more
severely
it
must
be
allowed
that
hypocrisy
though
so
different
from
religion
indicates
its
existence
as
smoke
points
out
that
of
pure
fire
hypocrisy
can
not
exist
unless
religion
be
to
a
certain
extent
held
in
esteem
because
no
one
would
be
at
the
trouble
to
assume
a
mask
which
was
not
respectable
and
so
far
compliance
with
the
external
forms
of
religion
is
a
tribute
paid
to
the
doctrines
which
it
teaches
the
hypocrite
assumes
a
virtue
if
he
has
it
not
and
the
example
of
his
conduct
may
be
salutary
to
others
though
his
pretensions
to
piety
are
wickedness
to
him
who
trieth
the
heart
and
reins
on
the
other
hand
the
academy
formed
by
the
wily
richelieu
served
to
unite
the
literature
of
france
into
one
focus
under
the
immediate
patronage
of
the
crown
to
whose
bounty
its
professors
were
taught
to
look
even
for
the
very
means
of
subsistence
the
greater
nobles
caught
this
ardour
of
patronage
from
the
sovereign
and
as
the
latter
pensioned
and
supported
the
principal
literary
characters
of
his
reign
the
former
granted
shelter
and
support
to
others
of
the
same
rank
who
were
lodged
at
their
hotels
fed
at
their
tables
and
were
admitted
to
their
society
upon
terms
somewhat
less
degrading
than
those
which
were
granted
to
artists
and
musicians
and
who
gave
to
the
great
knowledge
or
amusement
in
exchange
for
the
hospitality
they
received
men
in
a
situation
so
subordinate
could
only
at
first
accommodate
their
compositions
to
the
taste
and
interest
of
their
protectors
they
heightened
by
adulation
and
flattery
the
claims
of
the
king
and
the
nobles
upon
the
community
and
the
nation
indifferent
at
that
time
to
all
literature
which
was
not
of
native
growth
felt
their
respect
for
their
own
government
enhanced
and
extended
by
the
works
of
those
men
of
genius
who
flourished
under
its
protection
such
was
the
system
of
french
monarchy
and
such
it
remained
in
outward
show
at
least
until
the
peace
of
fontainbleau
but
its
foundation
had
been
gradually
undermined
public
opinion
had
undergone
a
silent
but
almost
a
total
change
and
it
might
be
compared
to
some
ancient
tower
swayed
from
its
base
by
the
lapse
of
time
and
waiting
the
first
blast
of
a
hurricane
or
shock
of
an
earthquake
to
be
prostrated
in
the
dust
how
the
lapse
of
half
a
century
or
little
more
could
have
produced
a
change
so
total
must
next
be
considered
and
this
can
only
be
done
by
viewing
separately
the
various
changes
which
the
lapse
of
years
had
produced
on
the
various
orders
of
the
state
sidenote
decay
of
the
nobility
first
then
it
is
to
be
observed
that
in
these
latter
times
the
wasting
effects
of
luxury
and
vanity
had
totally
ruined
the
greater
part
of
the
french
nobility
a
word
which
in
respect
of
that
country
comprehended
what
is
called
in
britain
the
nobility
and
gentry
or
natural
aristocracy
of
the
kingdom
this
body
during
the
reign
of
louis
though
far
even
then
from
supporting
the
part
which
their
fathers
had
acted
in
history
yet
existed
as
it
were
through
their
remembrances
and
disguised
their
dependence
upon
the
throne
by
the
outward
show
of
fortune
as
well
as
by
the
consequence
attached
to
hereditary
right
they
were
one
step
nearer
the
days
not
then
totally
forgotten
when
the
nobles
of
france
with
their
retainers
actually
formed
the
army
of
the
kingdom
and
they
still
presented
to
the
imagination
at
least
the
descendants
of
a
body
of
chivalrous
heroes
ready
to
tread
in
the
path
of
their
ancestors
should
the
times
ever
render
necessary
the
calling
forth
the
ban
or
the
feudal
array
of
the
gallic
chivalry
but
this
delusion
had
passed
away
the
defence
of
states
was
intrusted
in
france
as
in
other
countries
to
the
exertions
of
a
standing
army
and
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
nobles
of
france
presented
a
melancholy
contrast
to
their
predecessors
the
number
of
the
order
was
of
itself
sufficient
to
diminish
its
consequence
it
had
been
imprudently
increased
by
new
creations
there
were
in
the
kingdom
about
eighty
thousand
families
enjoying
the
privileges
of
nobility
and
the
order
was
divided
into
different
classes
which
looked
on
each
other
with
mutual
jealousy
and
contempt
the
first
general
distinction
was
betwixt
the
ancient
and
modern
or
new
noblesse
the
former
were
nobles
of
old
creation
whose
ancestors
had
obtained
their
rank
from
real
or
supposed
services
rendered
to
the
nation
in
her
councils
or
her
battles
the
new
nobles
had
found
an
easier
access
to
the
same
elevation
by
the
purchase
of
territories
or
of
offices
or
of
letters
of
nobility
any
of
which
easy
modes
invested
the
owners
with
titles
and
rank
often
held
by
men
whose
wealth
had
been
accumulated
in
mean
and
sordid
occupations
or
by
and
financiers
whom
the
people
considered
as
acquiring
their
fortunes
at
the
expense
of
the
state
these
numerous
additions
to
the
privileged
body
of
nobles
accorded
ill
with
its
original
composition
and
introduced
schism
and
disunion
into
the
body
itself
the
descendants
of
the
ancient
chivalry
of
france
looked
with
scorn
upon
the
new
men
who
rising
perhaps
from
the
very
lees
of
the
people
claimed
from
superior
wealth
a
share
in
the
privileges
of
the
aristocracy
again
secondly
there
was
amongst
the
ancient
nobles
themselves
but
too
ample
room
for
division
between
the
upper
and
wealthier
class
of
nobility
who
had
fortunes
adequate
to
maintain
their
rank
and
the
much
more
numerous
body
whose
poverty
rendered
them
pensioners
upon
the
state
for
the
means
of
supporting
their
dignity
of
about
one
thousand
houses
of
which
the
ancient
noblesse
is
computed
to
have
consisted
there
were
not
above
two
or
three
hundred
families
who
had
retained
the
means
of
maintaining
their
rank
without
the
assistance
of
the
crown
their
claims
to
monopolize
commissions
in
the
army
and
situations
in
the
government
together
with
their
exemption
from
taxes
were
their
sole
resources
resources
burdensome
to
the
state
and
odious
to
the
people
without
being
in
the
same
degree
beneficial
to
those
who
enjoyed
them
even
in
military
service
which
was
considered
as
their
the
nobility
of
the
second
class
were
seldom
permitted
to
rise
above
a
certain
limited
rank
long
service
might
exalt
one
of
them
to
the
of
or
the
government
of
some
small
town
but
all
the
better
rewards
of
a
life
spent
in
the
army
were
reserved
for
nobles
of
the
highest
order
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
amidst
so
many
of
this
privileged
body
who
languished
in
poverty
and
could
not
rise
from
it
by
the
ordinary
paths
of
industry
some
must
have
had
recourse
to
loose
and
dishonourable
practices
and
that
and
places
of
debauchery
should
have
been
frequented
and
patronised
by
individuals
whose
ancient
descent
titles
and
emblems
of
nobility
did
not
save
them
from
the
suspicion
of
very
dishonourable
conduct
the
disgrace
of
which
affected
the
character
of
the
whole
body
there
must
be
noticed
a
third
classification
of
the
order
into
the
haute
noblesse
or
men
of
the
highest
rank
most
of
whom
spent
their
lives
at
court
and
in
discharge
of
the
great
offices
of
the
crown
and
state
and
the
noblesse
campagnarde
who
continued
to
reside
upon
their
patrimonial
estates
in
the
provinces
the
noblesse
of
the
latter
class
had
fallen
gradually
into
a
state
of
general
contempt
which
was
deeply
to
be
regretted
they
were
ridiculed
and
scorned
by
the
courtiers
who
despised
the
rusticity
of
their
manners
and
by
the
nobles
of
newer
creation
who
conscious
of
their
own
wealth
contemned
the
poverty
of
these
ancient
but
decayed
families
the
bold
peasant
himself
not
more
a
kingdom
pride
than
is
the
plain
country
gentleman
who
living
on
his
own
means
and
amongst
his
own
people
becomes
the
natural
protector
and
referee
of
the
farmer
and
the
peasant
and
in
case
of
need
either
the
firmest
assertor
of
their
rights
and
his
own
against
the
aggressions
of
the
crown
or
the
independent
and
undaunted
defender
of
the

against
the
innovations
of
political
fanaticism
in
la

alone
the
nobles
had
united
their
interest
and
their
fortune
with
those
of
the
peasants
who
cultivated
their
estates
and
there
alone
were
they
found
in
their
proper
and
honourable
character
of

on

attached

there
alone
the

held
towards
each

natural
and
proper
relations
of
patron
and
client
faithful
dependents
and
generous
and
affectionate
superiors
in
the
other
provinces
of

the
nobility
speaking
generally
possessed
neither
power
nor
influence
among
the
peasantry
while
the
population
around
them
was
guided
and
influenced
by
men
belonging
to
the
church
to
the
law
or
to
business
classes
which
were
in
general
better
educated
better
informed
and
possessed
of
more
talent
and
knowledge
of
the
world
than
the
poor
noblesse
campagnarde
who
seemed
as
much
limited
caged
and
imprisoned
within
the
restraints
of
their
rank
as
if
they
had
been
shut
up
within
the
dungeons
of
their
ruinous
chateaux
and
who
had
only
their
titles
and
dusty
parchments
to
oppose
to
the
real
superiority
of
wealth
and
information
so
generally
to
be
found
in
the
class
which
they
affected
to
despise
hence
ségur
describes
the
country
gentlemen
of
his
younger
days
as
punctilious
ignorant
and
quarrelsome
shunned
by
the
of
the
middle
classes
idle
and
dissipated
and
wasting
their
leisure
hours
in
theatres
and
the
more
wealthy
families
and
the
high
noblesse
as
they
were
called
saw
this
degradation
of
the
inferior
part
of
their
order
without
pity
or
rather
with
pleasure
these
last
had
risen
as
much
above
their
natural
duties
as
the
rural
nobility
had
sunk
beneath
them
they
had
too
well
followed
the
course
which
richelieu
had
contrived
to
recommend
to
their
fathers
and
instead
of
acting
as
the
natural
chiefs
and
leaders
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
provinces
they
were
continually
engaged
in
intriguing
for
charges
round
the
king
person
for
posts
in
the
administration
for
additional
titles
and
decorations
for
all
and
every
thing
which
could
make
the
successful
courtier
and
distinguish
him
from
the
independent
noble
their
education
and
habits
also
were
totally
unfavourable
to
grave
or
serious
thought
and
exertion
if
the
trumpet
had
sounded
it
would
have
found
a
ready
echo
in
their
bosoms
but
light
literature
at
best
and
much
more
frequently
silly
and
frivolous
amusements
a
constant
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
a
perpetual
succession
of
intrigues
either
of
love
or
petty
politics
made
their
character
in
time
of
peace
approach
in
insignificance
to
that
of
the
women
of
the
court
whom
it
was
the
business
of
their
lives
to
captivate
and
amuse
there
were
noble
exceptions
but
in
general
the
order
in
every
thing
but
military
courage
had
assumed
a
trivial
and
effeminate
character
from
which
patriotic
sacrifices
or
masculine
wisdom
were
scarcely
to
be
expected
while
the
first
nobles
of
france
were
engaged
in
these
frivolous
pursuits
their
procureurs
bailiffs
stewards
intendants
or
by
whatever
name
their
agents
and
managers
were
designated
enjoyed
the
real
influence
which
their
constituents
rejected
as
beneath
them
rose
into
a
degree
of
authority
and
credit
which
eclipsed
recollection
of
the
distant
and
regardless
proprietor
and
formed
a
rank
in
the
state
not
very
different
from
that
of
the
in
ireland
these
agents
were
necessarily
of
plebeian
birth
and
their
profession
required
that
they
should
be
familiar
with
the
details
of
public
business
which
they
administered
in
the
name
of
their
seigneurs
many
of
this
condition
gained
power
and
wealth
in
the
course
of
the
revolution
thus
succeeding
like
an
able
and
intelligent
vizier
to
the
power
which
was
forfeited
by
the
idle
and
voluptuous
sultan
of
the
high
noblesse
it
might
with
truth
be
said
that
they
still
formed
the
grace
of
the
court
of
france
though
they
had
ceased
to
be
its
defence
they
were
accomplished
brave
full
of
honour
and
in
many
instances
endowed
with
talent
but
the
communication
was
broken
off
betwixt
them
and
the
subordinate
orders
over
whom
in
just
degree
they
ought
to
have
possessed
a
natural
influence
the
chain
of
gradual
and
insensible
connexion
was
rusted
by
time
in
almost
all
its
dependencies
forcibly
distorted
and
contemptuously
wrenched
asunder
in
many
the
noble
had
neglected
and
flung
from
him
the
most
precious
jewel
in
his
coronet
the
love
and
respect
of
the
the
farmer
and
the
peasant
an
advantage
so
natural
to
his
condition
in
a
society
and
founded
upon
principles
so
estimable
that
he
who
contemns
or
destroys
it
is
guilty
of
little
less
than
high
treason
both
to
his
own
rank
and
to
the
community
in
general
such
a
change
however
had
taken
place
in
france
so
that
the
noblesse
might
be
compared
to
a
the
hilt
carved
ornamented
and
gilded
such
as
might
grace
a
day
of
parade
but
the
blade
gone
or
composed
of
the
most
worthless
materials
it
only
remains
to
be
mentioned
that
there
subsisted
besides
all
the
distinctions
we
have
noticed
an
essential
difference
in
political
opinions
among
the
noblesse
themselves
considered
as
a
body
there
were
many
of
the
order
who
looking
to
the
exigencies
of
the
kingdom
were
patriotically
disposed
to
sacrifice
their
own
exclusive
privileges
in
order
to
afford
a
chance
of
its
regeneration
these
of
course
were
disposed
to
favour
an
alteration
or
reform
in
the
original
constitution
of
france
but
besides
these
enlightened
individuals
the
nobility
had
the
misfortune
to
include
many
disappointed
and
desperate
men
ungratified
by
any
of
the
advantages
which
their
rank
made
them
capable
of
receiving
and
whose
advantages
of
birth
and
education
only
rendered
them
more
deeply
dangerous
or
more
daringly
profligate
a
plebeian
dishonoured
by
his
vices
or
depressed
by
the
poverty
which
is
their
consequence
sinks
easily
into
the
insignificance
from
which
wealth
or
character
alone
raised
him
but
the
noble
often
retains
the
means
as
well
as
the
desire
to
avenge
himself
on
society
for
an
expulsion
which
he
feels
not
the
less
because
he
is
conscious
of
deserving
it
such
were
the
debauched
roman
youth
among
whom
were
found
cataline
and
associates
equal
in
talents
and
in
depravity
to
their
leader
and
such
was
the
celebrated
mirabeau
who
almost
expelled
from
his
own
class
as
an
irreclaimable
profligate

the
arena
of
the
revolution

a
reformer
and
a
popular
advocate

lower
orders

that
second
pillar
of
the
throne
was
scarce
more
solid
than
that
of
the
nobility
generally
speaking
it
might
be
said
that
for
a
long
time
the
higher
orders
of
the
clergy
had
ceased
to
take
a
vital
concern
in
their
profession
or
to
exercise
its
functions
in
a
manner
which
interested
the
feelings
and
affections
of
men
the
catholic
church
had
grown
old
and
unfortunately
did
not
possess
the
means
of
renovating
her
doctrines
or
improving
her
constitution
so
as
to
keep
pace
with
the
enlargement
of
the
human
understanding
the
lofty
claims
to
infallibility
which
she
had
set
up
and
maintained
during
the
middle
ages
claims
which
she
could
neither
renounce
nor
modify
now
threatened
in
more
enlightened
times
like
battlements

heavy

the
foundation

be

means
of

be
the
motto
of
the
church
of
rome
she
could
explain
nothing
soften
nothing
renounce
nothing
consistently
with
her
assertion
of
impeccability
the
whole
trash
which
had
been
accumulated
for
ages
of
darkness
and
ignorance
whether
consisting
of
extravagant
pretensions
incredible
assertions
absurd
doctrines
which
confounded
the
understanding
or
puerile
ceremonies
which
revolted
the
taste
were
alike
incapable
of
being
explained
away
or
abandoned
it
would
certainly
have
been
humanly
speaking
advantageous
alike
for
the
church
of
rome
and
for
christianity
in
general
that
the
former
had
possessed
the
means
of
relinquishing
her
extravagant
claims
modifying
her
more
obnoxious
doctrines
and
retrenching
her
superstitious
ceremonial
as
increasing
knowledge
showed
the
injustice
of
the
one
and
the
absurdity
of
the
other
but
this
power
she
dared
not
assume
and
hence
perhaps
the
great
schism
which
divides
the
christian
world
which
might
otherwise
never
have
existed
or
at
least
not
in
its
present
extended
and
embittered
state
but
in
all
events
the
church
of
rome
retaining
the
spiritual
empire
over
so
large
and
fair
a
portion
of
the
christian
world
would
not
have
been
reduced
to
the
alternative
of
either
defending
propositions
which
in
the
eyes
of
all
enlightened
men
are
altogether
untenable
or
of
beholding
the
most
essential
and
vital
doctrines
of
christianity
confounded
with
them
and
the
whole
system
exposed
to
the
scorn
of
the
infidel
the
more
enlightened
and
better
informed
part
of
the
french
nation
had
fallen
very
generally
into
the
latter
extreme
infidelity
in
attacking
the
absurd
claims
and
extravagant
doctrines
of
the
church
of
rome
had
artfully
availed
herself
of
those
abuses
as
if
they
had
been
really
a
part
of
the
christian
religion
and
they
whose
credulity
could
not
digest
the
grossest
articles
of
the
papist
creed
thought
themselves
entitled
to
conclude
in
general
against
religion
itself
from
the
abuses
engrafted
upon
it
by
ignorance
and
priestcraft
the
same
circumstances
which
favoured
the
assault
tended
to
weaken
the
defence
embarrassed
by
the
necessity
of
defending
the
mass
of
human
inventions
with
which
their
church
had
obscured
and
deformed
christianity
the
catholic
clergy
were
not
the
best
advocates
even
in
the
best
of
causes
and
though
there
were
many
brilliant
exceptions
yet
it
must
be
owned
that
a
great
part
of
the
higher
orders
of
the
priesthood
gave
themselves
little
trouble
about
maintaining
the
doctrines
or
extending
the
influence
of
the
church
considering
it
only
in
the
light
of
an
asylum
where
under
the
condition
of
certain
renunciations
they
enjoyed
in
indolent
tranquillity
a
state
of
ease
and
luxury
those
who
thought
on
the
subject
more
deeply
were
contented
quietly
to
repose
the
safety
of
the
church
upon
the
restrictions
on
the
press
which
prevented
the
possibility
of
free
discussion
the
usual
effect
followed
and
many
who
if
manly
and
open
debate
upon
theological
subjects
had
been
allowed
would
doubtless
have
been
enabled
to
winnow
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
were
in
the
state
of
darkness
to
which
they
were
reduced
led
to
reject
christianity
itself
along
with
the
corruptions
of
the
romish
church
and
to
become
absolute
infidels
instead
of
reformed
christians
sidenote
the
clergy
dubois
the
long
and
violent
dispute
also
betwixt
the
jesuits
and
the
jansenists
had
for
many
years
tended
to
lessen
the
general
consideration
for
the
church
at
large
and
especially
for
the
higher
orders
of
the
clergy
in
that
quarrel
much
had
taken
place
that
was
disgraceful
the
mask
of
religion
has
been
often
used
to
cover
more
savage
and
extensive
persecutions
but
at
no
time
did
the
spirit
of
intrigue
of
personal
malice
of
slander
and
circumvention
appear
more
disgustingly
from
under
the
sacred
disguise
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
thoughtless
and
the
vulgar
the
general
cause
of
religion
suffered
in
proportion
the
number
of
the
clergy
who
were
thus
indifferent
to
doctrine
or
duty
was
greatly
increased
since
the
promotion
to
the
great
benefices
had
ceased
to
be
distributed
with
regard
to
the
morals
piety
talents
and
erudition
of
the
candidates
but
was
bestowed
among
the
younger
branches
of
the
noblesse
upon
men
who
were
at
little
pains
to
reconcile
the
looseness
of
their
former
habits
and
opinions
with
the
sanctity
of
their
new
profession
and
who
embracing
the
church
solely
as
a
means
of
maintenance
were
little
calculated
by
their
lives
or
learning
to
extend
its
consideration
among
other
vile
innovations
of
the
celebrated
regent
duke
of
orleans
he
set
the
most
barefaced
example
of
such
dishonourable
preferment
and
had
increased
in
proportion
the
contempt
entertained
for
the
hierarchy
even
in
its
highest
dignities
since
how
was
it
possible
to
respect
the
purple
itself
after
it
had
covered
the
shoulders
of
the
infamous
dubois
it
might
have
been
expected
and
it
was
doubtless
in
a
great
measure
the
case
that
the
respect
paid
to
the
characters
and
efficient
utility
of
the
curates
upon
whom
generally
speaking
the
charge
of
souls
actually
devolved
might
have
made
up
for
the
want
of
consideration
withheld
from
the
higher
orders
of
the
church
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
respectable
body
of
churchmen
possessed
great
and
deserved
influence
over
their
parishioners
but
then
they
were
themselves
languishing
under
poverty
and
neglect
and
as
human
beings
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
viewed
with
indifference
their
superiors
enjoying
wealth
and
ease
while
in
some
cases
they
dishonoured
the
robe
they
wore
and
in
others
disowned
the
doctrines
they
were
appointed
to
teach
alive
to
feelings
so
natural
and
mingling
with
the
middling
classes
of
which
they
formed
a
most
respectable
portion
they
must
necessarily
have
become
embued
with
their
principles
and
opinions
and
a
very
obvious
train
of
reasoning
would
extend
the
consequences
to
their
own
condition
if
the
state
was
encumbered
rather
than
benefited
by
the
privileges
of
the
higher
order
was
not
the
church
in
the
same
condition
and
if
secular
rank
was
to
be
thrown
open
as
a
general
object
of
ambition
to
the
able
and
the
worthy
ought
not
the
dignities
of
the
church
to
be
rendered
more
accessible
to
those
who
in
humility
and
truth
discharged
the
toilsome
duties
of
its
inferior
offices
and
who
might
therefore
claim
in
due
degree
of
succession
to
attain
higher
preferment
there
can
be
no
injustice
in
ascribing
to
this
body
sentiments
which
might
have
been
no
less
just
regarding
the
church
than
advantageous
to
themselves
and
accordingly
it
was
not
long
before
this
body
of
churchmen
showed
distinctly
that
their
political
views
were
the
same
with
those
of
the
third
estate
to
which
they
solemnly
united
themselves
strengthening
thereby
greatly
the
first
revolutionary
movements
but
their
conduct
when
they
beheld
the
whole
system
of
their
religion
aimed
at

acquit
the
french

of

with
the

while
they
were
envied
for
their
ancient
immunities
without
being
any

for

while

were

hated
for

assumption
of
a
superiority

their
personal
qualities
did
not

vindicate

or
as
they
were
at
that
time
termed

gradually
acquired

extent

importance
unknown

the
feudal

ancient

no

of

introduced

from
sources
to
which
the
nobles
and
the
churchmen
had
no
access
not
only
a
very
great
proportion
of
the
disposable
capital
was
in
the
hands
of
the
third
estate
who
thus
formed
the
bulk
of
the
moneyed
interest
of
france
but
a
large

landed

also

possession

was

influence
which
many
plebeians
possessed
as
creditors
over
those
needy
nobles
whom
they
had
supplied
with
money
while
another
portion
of
the
same
class
rose
into
wealth
and
consideration
at
the
expense
of
the
more
opulent
patricians
who
were
ruining
themselves
paris
had
increased
to
a
tremendous

and
her
citizens
had
risen
to
a
corresponding
degree
of
consideration
and
while
they
profited
by
the
luxury
and
dissipation
both
of
the
court
and
courtiers
had
become
rich
in
proportion
as
the
government
and
privileged
classes
grew
poor
those
citizens
who
were
thus
enriched
endeavoured
by
bestowing
on
their
families
all
the
advantages
of
good
education
to
counterbalance
their
inferiority
of
birth
and
to
qualify
their
children
to
support
their
part
in
the
scenes
to
which
their
altered
fortunes
and
the
prospects
of
the
country
appeared
to
call
them
in
short
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
middling
classes
acquired
the
advantages
of
wealth
consequence
and
effective
power
in
a
proportion
more
than
equal
to
that
in
which
the
nobility
had
lost
these
attributes
thus
the
third
estate
seemed
to
increase
in
extent
number
and
strength
like
a
waxing
inundation
threatening
with
every
increasing
wave
to
overwhelm
the
ancient
and
decayed
barriers
of
exclusions
and
immunities
behind
which
the
privileged
ranks
still
fortified
themselves
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
man
that
the
bold
the
talented
the
ambitious
of
a
rank
which
felt
its
own
power
and
consequence
should
be
long
contented
to
remain
acquiescent
in
political
regulations
which
depressed
them
in
the
state
of
society
beneath
men
to
whom
they
felt
themselves
equal
in
all
respects
excepting
the
factitious
circumstances
of
birth
or
of
church
orders
it
was
no
less
impossible
that
they
should
long
continue
satisfied
with
the
feudal
dogmas
which
exempted
the
noblesse
from
taxes
because
they
served
the
nation
with
their
sword
and
the
clergy
because
they
propitiated
heaven
in
its
favour
with
their
prayers
the
maxim
however
true
in
the
feudal
ages
when
it
originated
had
become
an
extravagant
legal
fiction
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
all
the
world
knew
that
both
the
noble
soldier
and
the
priest
were
paid
for
the
services
they
no
longer
rendered
to
the
state
while
the
had
both
valour
and
learning
to
fight
his
own
battles
and
perform
his
own
devotions
and
when
in
fact
it
was
their
arms
which
combated
and
their
learning
which
enlightened
the
state
rather
than
those
of
the
privileged

honour
and
talent

course
of

communication
with
the
celebrated
marquis
de

latter
had
avowed
his
principles
of

his
detestation

only
rendered
obedience

candour

occasioned

the

fruits

of

most
deadly
poison

french
the
most
ingenious
people
in
europe
and
the
most
susceptible
of
those
pleasures
which
arise
from
conversation
and
literary
discussion
had
early
called
in
the
assistance
of
men
of
genius
to
enhance
their
relish
for
society
the
nobles
without
renouncing
their
aristocratic
superiority
which
on
the
contrary
was
rendered
more
striking
by
the
contrast
permitted
literary
talents
to
be
a
passport
into
their
saloons
the
wealthy
financier
and
opulent
merchant
emulated
the
nobility
in
this
as
in
other
articles
of
taste
and
splendour
and
their
coteries
as
well
as
those
of
the
aristocracy
were
open
to
men
of
letters
who
were
in
many
cases
contented
to
enjoy
luxury
at
the
expense
of
independence
assuredly
this
species
of
patronage
while
it
often
flowed
from
the
vanity
or
egotism
of
the
patrons
was
not
much
calculated
to
enhance
the
character
of
those
who
were
protected
professors
of
literature
thus
mingling
in
the
society
of
the
noble
and
the
wealthy
upon
sufferance
held
a
rank
scarcely
higher
than
that
of
musicians
or
actors
from
amongst
whom
individuals
have
often
by
their
talents
and
character
become
members
of
the
best
society
while
the
castes
to
which
such
individuals
belong
remain
in
general
exposed
to
the
most
humiliating
contempt
the
lady
of
quality
who
smiled
on
the
man
of
letters
and
the
man
of
rank
who
admitted
him
to
his
intimacy
still
retained
their
consciousness
that
he
was
not
like
themselves
formed
out
of
the
porcelain
clay
of
the
earth
and
even
while
receiving
their
bounties
or
participating
in
their
pleasures
the
favourite
must
often
have
been
disturbed
by
the
reflection
that
he
was
only
considered
as
a
creature
of
sufferance
whom
the
caprice
of
fashion
or
a
sudden
reaction
of
the
ancient
etiquette
might
fling
out
of
the
society
where
he
was
at
present
tolerated
under
this
disheartening
and
even
degrading
inferiority
the
man
of
letters
might
be
tempted
invidiously
to
compare
the
luxurious
style
of
living
at
which
he
sat
a
permitted
guest
with
his
own
paltry
hired
apartment
and
scanty
and
uncertain
chance
of
support
and
even
those
of
a
nobler
mood
when
they
had
conceded
to
their
benefactors
all
the
gratitude
they
could
justly
demand
must
sometimes
have
regretted
their
own
situation
condemn
as
needy
supplicants
to
wait
while
ladies
interpose
and
slaves
debate
it
followed
that
many
of
the
men
of
letters
thus
protected
became
enemies
of
the
persons
as
well
as
the
rank
of
their
patrons
as
for
example
no
one
in
the
course
of
the
revolution
expressed
greater
hatred
to
the
nobility
than
champfort
the
favourite
and
favoured
secretary
of
the
prince
of
condé
occasions
too
must
frequently
have
occurred
in
which
the
protected
person
was
almost
inevitably
forced
upon
comparing
his
own
natural
and
acquired
talents
with
those
of
his
aristocratic
patron
and
the
result
could
not
be
other
than
a
dislike
of
the
institutions
which
placed
him
so
far
behind
persons
whom
but
for
those
prescribed
limits
he
must
have
passed
in
the
career
of
honour
and
distinction
hence
arose
that
frequent
and
close
inquiry
into
the
origin
of
ranks
that
general
system
of
impugning
the
existing
regulations
and
appealing
to
the
original
states
of
society
in
vindication
of
the
original
equality
of
mankind
hence
those
ingenious
arguments
and
eloquent
tirades
in
favour
of
primitive
and
even
savage
independence
which
the
patricians
of
the
day
read
and
applauded
with
such
a
smile
of
mixed
applause
and
pity
as
they
would
have
given
to
the
reveries
of
a
crazed
poet
while
the
inferior
ranks
participating
the
feelings
under
which
they
were
written
caught
the
ardour
of
the
eloquent
authors
and
rose
from
the
perusal
with
minds
prepared
to
act
whenever
action
should
be
necessary
to
realize
a
vision
so
flattering
it
might
have
been
expected
that
those
belonging
to
the
privileged
classes
at
least
would
have
caught
the
alarm
from
hearing
doctrines
so
fatal
to
their
own
interests
avowed
so
boldly
and
maintained
with
so
much
talent
it
might
have
been
thought
that
they
would
have
started
when
raynal
proclaimed
to
the
nations
of
the
earth
that
they
could
only
be
free
and
happy
when
they
had
overthrown
every
throne
and
every
altar
but
no
such
alarm
was
taken
men
of
rank
considered
liberal
principles
as
the
fashion
of
the
day
and
embraced
them
as
the
readiest
mode
of
showing
that
they
were
above
vulgar
prejudices
in
short
they
adopted
political
opinions
as
they
put
on
round
hats
and
merely
because
they
were
current
in
good
society
they
assumed
the
tone
of
philosophers
as
they
would
have
done
that
of
arcadian
shepherds
at
a
masquerade
but
without
any
more
thoughts

sacrificing

own
rank

light
career

the
antiquated
pride
of
the
old

the
irksome
etiquette
of
the
old

of
things
the
severity
of

the
aversion
of
our
parents
to
our
new
fashions
and
our
costumes
which
were
favourable
to
the
principles
of
equality

felt
disposed
to
adopt

doctrines
professed
by

men

for
their
boldness

their
wit

pleasure

that
their
attacks
were
directed
against
an
old
fabric
which
presented
to
us
a
gothic
and
ridiculous
appearance
we
were
thus
pleased
at
this
petty
war
although
it
was
undermining
our
own
ranks
and
privileges
and
the
remains
of
our
ancient
power
but
we
felt
not
these
attacks
personally
we
merely
witnessed
them
it
was
as
yet
but
a
war
of
words
and
paper
which
did
not
appear
to
us
to
threaten
the
superiority
of
existence
we
enjoyed
consolidated
as
we
thought
it
by
a
possession
of
many
centuries
we
were
pleased
with
the
courage
of
liberty
whatever
language
it
assumed
and
with
the
convenience
of
equality
there
is
a
satisfaction
in
descending
from
a
high
rank
as
long
as
the
resumption
of
it
is
thought
to
be
free
and
unobstructed
and
regardless
therefore
of
consequences
we
enjoyed
our
patrician
advantages
together
with
the
sweets
of
a
plebeian
philosophy
we
anxiously
desire
not
to
be
mistaken
it
is
not
the
purport
of
these
remarks
to
blame
the
french
aristocracy
for
extending
their
patronage
to
learning
and
to
genius
the
purpose
was
honourable
to
themselves
and
fraught
with
high
advantages
to
the
progress
of
society
the
favour
of
the
great
supplied
the
want
of
public
encouragement
and
fostered
talent
which
otherwise
might
never
have
produced
its
important
and
inappreciable
fruits
but
it
had
been
better
for
france
her
nobility
and
her
literature
had
the
patronage
been
extended
in
some
manner
which
did
not
intimately
associate
the
two
classes
of
men
the
want
of
independence
of
circumstances
is
a
severe
if
not
an
absolute
check
to
independence
of
spirit
and
thus
it
often
happened
that
to
gratify
the
passions
of
their
protectors
or
to
advance
their
interest
the
men
of
letters
were
involved
in
the
worst
and
most
scandalous
labyrinths
of
slander
and
malignity
that
they
were
divided
into
desperate
factions
against
each
other
and
reduced
to
practise
all
those
arts
of
dissimulation
flattery
and
intrigue
which
are
the
greatest
shame
of
the
literary
profession
sidenote
french
literature
and
philosophy
as
the
eighteenth
century
advanced
the
men
of
literature
rose
in
importance
and
aware
of
their
own
increasing
power
in
a
society
which
was
dependent
on
them
for
intellectual
gratification
they
supported
each
other
in
their
claims
to
what
began
to
be
considered
the
dignity
of
a
man
of
letters
this
was
soon
carried
into
extremes
and
assumed
even
in
the
halls
of
their
protectors
a
fanatical
violence
of
opinion
and
a
dogmatical
mode
of
expression
which
made
the
veteran
fontenelle
declare
himself
terrified
for
the
frightful
degree
of
that
folks
met
with
every
where
in
society
the
truth
is
that
men
of
letters
being
usually
men
of
mere
theory
have
no
opportunity
of
measuring
the
opinions
which
they
have
adopted
upon
hypothetical
reasoning
by
the
standard
of
practical
experiment
they
feel
their
mental
superiority
to
those
whom
they
live
with
and
become
habitual
believers
in
and
assertors
of
their
own
infallibility
if
moderation
command
of
passions
and
of
temper
be
part
of
philosophy
we
seldom
find
less
philosophy
actually
displayed
than
by
a
philosopher
in
defence
of
a
favourite
theory
nor
have
we
found
that
churchmen
are
so
desirous
of
forming
proselytes
or
soldiers
of
extending
conquests
as
philosophers
in
making
converts
to
their
own
opinions
in
france
they
had
discovered
the
command
which
they
had
acquired
over
the
public
mind
and
united
as
they
were
and
more
especially
the
encyclopedists
they
augmented
and
secured
that
impression
by
never
permitting
the
doctrines
which
they
wished
to
propagate
to
die
away
upon
the
public
ear
for
this
purpose
they
took
care
these
should
be
echoed
like
thunder
amongst
hills
from
a
hundred
different
points
presented
in
a
hundred
new
lights
illustrated
by
a
hundred
various
methods
until
the
public
could
no
longer
help
receiving
that
as
undeniable
which
they
heard
from
so
many
different
quarters
they
could
also
direct
every
weapon
of
satirical
hostility
against
those
who
ventured
to
combat
their
doctrines
and
as
their
wrath
was
neither
easily
endured
nor
pacified
they
drove
from
the
field
most
of
those
authors
who
in
opposition
to
their
opinions
might
have
exerted
themselves
as
champions
of
the
church
and
monarchy
we
have
already
hinted
at
the
disadvantages
which
literature
experiences
when
it
is
under
the
protection
of
private
individuals
of
opulence
rather
than
of
the
public
but
in
yet
another
important
respect
the
air
of
and
is
fatal
in
many
cases
to
the
masculine
spirit
of
philosophical
which
gives
dignity
to
literary
society
they
who
make
part
of
the
gay
society
of
a
corrupted
metropolis
must
lend
their
countenance
to
follies
and
vices
if
they
do
not
themselves
practise
them
and
hence
perhaps
french
literature
more
than
any
other
in
europe
has
been
liable
to
the
reproach
of
lending
its
powerful
arm
to
undermine
whatever
was
serious
in
morals
or
hitherto
considered
as
fixed
in
principle
some
of
their
greatest
authors
even
montesquieu
himself
have
varied
their
deep
reasonings
on
the
origin
of
government
and
the
most
profound
problems
of
philosophy
with
licentious
tales
tending
to
inflame
the
passions
hence
partaking
of
the
license
of
its
professors
the
degraded
literature
of
modern
times
called
in
to
its
alliance
that
immorality
which
not
only
christian
but
even
heathen
philosophy
had
considered
as
the
greatest
obstacle
to
a
pure
wise
and
happy
state
of
existence
the
licentiousness
which
walked
abroad
in
such
disgusting
and
undisguised
nakedness
was
a
part
of
the
unhappy
bequest
left
by
the
regent
duke
of
orleans
to
the
country
which
he
governed
the
decorum
of
the
court
during
the
times
of
louis
xiv
had
prevented
such
excesses
if
there
was
enough
of
vice
it
was
at
least
decently
veiled
but
the
conduct
of
orleans
and
his
minions
was
marked
with
open
infamy
deep
enough
to
have
called
down
in
the
age
of
miracles
an
immediate
judgment
from
heaven
and
crimes
which
the
worst
of
the
roman
emperors
would
have
at
least
hidden
in
his
solitary
isle
of
caprea
were
acted
as
publicly
as
if
men
had
had
no
eyes
or
god
no
thunderbolts
from
this
filthy
cocytus
flowed
those
streams
of
impurity
which
disgraced
france
during
the
reign
of
louis
and
which
notwithstanding
the
example
of
a
prince
who
was
himself
a
model
of
domestic
virtue
continued
in
that
of
louis
xvi
to
infect
society
morals
and
above
all
literature
we
do
not
here
allude
merely
to
those
lighter
pieces
of
indecency
in
which
humour
and
fancy
outrun
the
bounds
of
delicacy
these
are
to
be
found
in
the
literature
of
most
nations
and
are
generally
in
the
hands
of
mere
libertines
and
men
of
pleasure
so
well
acquainted
with
the
practice
of
vice
that
the
theory
can
not
make
them
worse
than
they
are
but
there
was
a
strain
of
voluptuous
and
seducing
immorality
which
pervaded
not
only
the
lighter
and
gayer
compositions
of
the
french
but
tinged
the
writings
of
those
who
called
the
world
to
admire
them
as
poets
of
the
highest
mood
or
to
listen
as
to
philosophers
of
the
most
lofty
pretensions
voltaire
rousseau
diderot
montesquieu
names
which
france
must
always
esteem
her
highest
honour
were
so
guilty
in
this
particular
that
the
young
and
virtuous
must
either
altogether
abstain
from
the
works
which
are
every
where
the
topic
of
ordinary
discussion
and
admiration
or
must
peruse
much
that
is
hurtful
to
delicacy
and
dangerous
to
morals
in
the
formation
of
their
future
character
the
latter
alternative
was
universally
adopted
for
the
curious
will
read
as
the
thirsty
will
drink
though
the
cup
and
page
be
polluted
so
far
had
an
indifference
to
delicacy
influenced
the
society
of
france
and
so
widely
spread
was
this
habitual
impurity
of
language
and
ideas
especially
among
those
who
pretended
to
philosophy
that
madame
roland
a
woman
admirable
for
courage
and
talents
and
not
so
far
as
appears
vicious
in
her
private
morals
not
only
mentions
the
profligate
novels
of
louvet
as
replete
with
the
graces
of
imagination
the
salt
of
criticism
and
the
tone
of
philosophy
but
affords
the
public
in
her
own
person
details
with
which
a
courtezan
of
the
higher
class
should
be
unwilling
to
season
her
private
conversation
this
license
with
the
corruption
of
morals
of
which
it
is
both
the
sign
and
the
cause
leads
directly
to
feelings
the
most
inconsistent
with
manly
and
virtuous
patriotism
voluptuousness
and
its
consequences
render
the
libertine
incapable
of
relish
for
what
is
simply
and
abstractedly
beautiful
or
sublime
whether
in
literature
or
in
the
arts
and
destroy
the
taste
while
they
degrade
and
blunt
the
understanding
but
above
all
such
libertinism
leads
to
the
exclusive
pursuit
of
selfish
gratification
for
egotism
is
its
foundation
and
its
essence
egotism
is
necessarily
the
very
reverse
of
patriotism
since
the
one
principle
is
founded
exclusively
upon
the
individual
pursuit
of
his
own
peculiar
objects
of
pleasure
or
advantage
while
the
other
demands
a
sacrifice
not
only
of
these
individual
pursuits
but
of
fortune
and
life
itself
to
the
cause
of
the
public
weal
patriotism
has
accordingly
always
been
found
to
flourish
in
that
state
of
society
which
is
most
favourable
to
the
stern
and
manly
virtues
of
temperance
chastity
contempt
of
luxury
patient
exertion
and
elevated
contemplation
and
the
public
spirit
of
a
nation
has
invariably
borne
a
just
proportion
to
its
private
morals
sidenote
infidelity
religion
can
not
exist
where
immorality
generally
prevails
any
more
than
a
light
can
burn
where
the
air
is
corrupted
and
accordingly
infidelity
was
so
general
in
france
as
to
predominate
in
almost
every
rank
of
society
the
errors
of
the
church
of
rome
as
we
have
already
noticed
connected
as
they
are
with
her
ambitious
attempts
towards
dominion
over
men
in
their
temporal
as
well
as
spiritual
capacity
had
long
become
the
argument
of
the
philosopher
and
the
jest
of
the
satirist
but
in
exploding
these
pretensions
and
holding
them
up
to
ridicule
the
philosophers
of
the
age
involved
with
them
the
general
doctrines
of
christianity
itself
nay
some
went
so
far
as
not
only
to
deny
inspiration
but
to
extinguish
by
their
sophistry
the
lights
of
natural
religion
implanted
in
our
bosoms
as
a
part
of
our
like
the
disorderly
rabble
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
but
with
infinitely
deeper
guilt
they
not
only
pulled
down
the
symbols
of
idolatry
which
ignorance
or
priestcraft
had
introduced
into
the
christian
church
but
sacrilegiously
defaced
and
desecrated
the
altar
itself
this
work
the
philosophers
as
they
termed
themselves
carried
on
with
such
an
unlimited
and
eager
zeal
as
plainly
to
show
that
infidelity
as
well
as
divinity
hath
its
fanaticism
an
envenomed
fury
against
religion
and
all
its
doctrines
a
promptitude
to
avail
themselves
of
every
circumstance
by
which
christianity
could
be
misrepresented
an
ingenuity
in
mixing
up
their
opinions
in
works
which
seemed
the
least
fitting
to
involve
such
discussions
above
all
a
pertinacity
in
slandering
ridiculing
and
vilifying
all
who
ventured
to
oppose
their
principles
distinguished
the
correspondents
in
this
celebrated
conspiracy
against
a
religion
which
however
it
may
be
defaced
by
human
inventions
breathes
only
that
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
the
children
of
men
which
was
proclaimed
by
heaven
at
its
divine
origin
if
these
prejudiced
and
envenomed
opponents
had
possessed
half
the
desire
of
truth
or
half
the
benevolence
towards
mankind
which
were
eternally
on
their
lips
they
would
have
formed
the
true
estimate
of
the
spirit
of
christianity
not
from
the
use
which
had
been
made
of
the
mere
name
by
ambitious
priests
or
enthusiastic
fools
but
by
its
vital
effects
upon
mankind
at
large
they
would
have
seen
that
under
its
influence
a
thousand
brutal
and
sanguinary
superstitions
had
died
away
that
polygamy
had
been
abolished
and
with
polygamy
all
the
obstacles
which
it
offers
to
domestic
happiness
as
well
as
to
the
due
education
of
youth
and
the
natural
and
gradual
civilisation
of
society
they
must
then
have
owned
that
slavery
which
they
regarded
or
affected
to
regard
with
such
horror
had
first
been
gradually
ameliorated
and
finally
abolished
by
the
influence
of
the
christian
doctrines
that
there
was
no
one
virtue
teaching
to
elevate
mankind
or
benefit
society
which
was
not
enjoined
by
the
precepts
they
endeavoured
to
misrepresent
and
weaken
no
one
vice
by
which
humanity
is
degraded
and
society
endangered
upon
which
christianity
hath
not
imposed
a
solemn
anathema
they
might
also
in
their
capacity
of
philosophers
have
considered
the
peculiar
aptitude
of
the
christian
religion
not
only
to
all
ranks
and
conditions
of
mankind
but
to
all
climates
and
to
all
stages
of
society
nor
ought
it
to
have
escaped
them
that
the
system
contains
within
itself
a
key
to
those
difficulties
doubts
and
mysteries
by
which
the
human
mind
is
agitated
so
soon
as
it
is
raised
beyond
the
mere
objects
which
interest
the
senses
milton
has
made
the
maze
of
metaphysics
and
the
bewildering
state
of
mind
which
they
engender
a
part
of
the
employment
and
perhaps
of
the
punishment
of
the
lower
regions
christianity
alone
offers
a
clew
to
this
labyrinth
a
solution
to
these
melancholy
and
discouraging
doubts
and
however
its
doctrines
may
be
hard
to
unaided
flesh
and
blood
yet
explaining
as
they
do
the
system
of
the
universe
which
without
them
is
so
incomprehensible
and
through
their
practical
influence
rendering
men
in
all
ages
more
worthy
to
act
their
part
in
the
general
plan
it
seems
wonderful
how
those
whose
professed
pursuit
was
wisdom
should
have
looked
on
religion
not
alone
with
that
indifference
which
was
the
only
feeling
evinced
by
the
heathen
philosophers
towards
the
gross
mythology
of
their
time
but
with
hatred
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
one
would
rather
have
expected
that
after
such
a
review
men
professing
the
real
spirit
which
searches
after
truth
and
wisdom
if
unhappily
they
were
still
unable
to
persuade
themselves
that
a
religion
so
worthy
of
the
deity
if
such
an
expression
may
be
used
had
emanated
directly
from
revelation
might
have
had
the
modesty
to
lay
their
finger
on
their
lip
and
distrust
their
own
judgment
instead
of
disturbing
the
faith
of
others
or
if
confirmed
in
their
incredulity
might
have
taken
the
leisure
to
compute
at
least
what
was
to
be
gained
by
rooting
up
a
tree
which
bore
such
goodly
fruits
without
having
the
means
of
replacing
it
by
aught
which
could
produce
the
same
advantage
to
the
commonwealth
unhappily
blinded
by
heated
with
the
ardour
of
controversy
gratifying
their
literary
pride
by
becoming
members
of
a
league
in
which
kings
and
princes
were
included
and
procuring
followers
by
flattering
the
vanity
of
some
and
stimulating
the
cupidity
of
others
the
men
of
the
most
distinguished
parts
in
france
became
allied
in
a
sort
of
against
christianity
and
indeed
against
religious
principles
of
every
kind
how
they
succeeded
is
too
universally
known
and
when
it
is
considered
that
these
men
of
letters
who
ended
by
degrading
the
morals
and
destroying
the
religion
of
so
many
of
the
citizens
of
france
had
been
first
called
into
public
estimation
by
the
patronage
of
the
higher
orders
it
is
impossible
not
to
think
of
the
israelitish
champion
who
brought
into
the
house
of
dagon
to
make
sport
for
the
festive
assembly
ended
by
pulling
it
down
upon
the
heads
of
the
guests
and
upon
his
own
we
do
not
tax
the
whole
nation
of
france
with
being
infirm
in
religious
faith
and
relaxed
in
morals
still
less
do
we
aver
that
the
revolution
which
broke
forth
in
that
country
owed
its
rise
exclusively
to
the
license
and
infidelity
which
were
but
too
current
there
the
necessity
of
a
great
change
in
the
principles
of
the
ancient
french
monarchy
had
its
source
in
the
usurpations
of
preceding
kings
over
the
liberties
of
the
subject
and
the
opportunity
for
effecting
this
change
was
afforded
by
the
weakness
and
pecuniary
distresses
of
the
present
government
these
would
have
existed
had
the
french
court
and
her
higher
orders
retained
the
simple
and
virtuous
manners
of
sparta
united
with
the
strong
and
pure
faith
of
primitive
christians
the
difference
lay
in
this
that
a
simple
virtuous
and
religious
people
would
have
rested
content
with
such
changes
and
alterations
in
the
constitution
of
their
government
as
might
remove
the
evils
of
which
they
had
just
and
pressing
reason
to
complain
they
would
have
endeavoured
to
redress
obvious
and
practical
errors
in
the
body
politic
without
being
led
into
extremes
either
by
the
love
of
realising
visionary
theories
the
vanity
of
enforcing
their
own
particular
philosophical
or
political
doctrines
or
the
selfish
arguments
of
demagogues
who
in
the
prospect
of
bettering
their
own
situation
by
wealth
or
obtaining
scope
for
their
ambition
aspired
in
the
words
of
the
dramatic
poet
to
throw
the
elements
of
society
into
confusion
and
thus
disturb
the
peace
of
all
the
world
to
rule
it
when
was
wildest
it
was
to
such
men
as
these
last
that
heaven
in
punishment
of
the
sins
of
france
and
of
europe
and
perhaps
to
teach
mankind
a
dreadful
lesson
abandoned
the
management
of
the
french
revolution
the
original
movements
of
which
so
far
as
they
went
to
secure
to
the
people
the
restoration
of
their
natural
liberty
and
the
abolition
of
the
usurpations
of
the
crown
had
become
not
only
desirable
through
the
change
of
times
and
by
the
influence
of
public
opinion
but
peremptorily
necessary
and
inevitable
sidenote
feudal
system
the
feudal
system
of
france
like
that
of
the
rest
of
europe
had
in
its
original
composition
all
the
germs
of
national
freedom
the
great
peers
in
whose
hands
the
common
defence
was
reposed
acknowledged
the
king
power
as
obeyed
his
commands
as
their
military
leader
and
attended
his
courts
as
their
supreme
judge
but
recognised
no
despotic
authority
in
the
crown
and
were
prompt
to
defend
the
slightest
encroachment
upon
their
own
rights
if
they
themselves
were
not
equally
tender
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
their
own
vassals
their
acts
of
encroachment
flowed
not
from
the
feudal
system
but
from
its
imperfections
the
tendency
and
spirit
of
these
singular
institutions
were
to
preserve
to
each
individual
his
just
and
natural
rights
but
a
system
almost
purely
military
was
liable
to
be
frequently
abused
by
the
most
formidable
soldier
and
was
besides
otherwise
ill
fitted
to
preserve
rights
which
were
purely
civil
it
is
not
necessary
to
trace
the
progress
from
the
days
of
louis
xiii
downwards
by
which
ambitious
monarchs
seconded
by
able
and
subtle
ministers
contrived
to
emancipate
themselves
from
the
restraints
of
their
powerful
vassals
or
by
which
the
descendants
of
these
high
feudatories
who
had
been
the
controllers
of
the
prince
so
soon
as
he
outstepped
the
bounds
of
legitimate
authority
were
now
ranked
around
the
throne
in
the
capacity
of
mere
courtiers
or
satellites
who
derived
their
lustre
solely
from
the
favour
of
royalty
this
unhappy
and
shortsighted
policy
had
however
accomplished
its
end
and
the
crown
had
concentrated
within
its
prerogative
almost
the
entire
liberties
of
the
french
nation
and
now
like
an
overgorged
animal
of
prey
had
reason
to
repent
its
fatal
voracity
while
it
lay
almost
helpless
exposed
to
the
assaults
of
those
whom
it
had
despoiled
we
have
already
observed
that
for
a
considerable
time
the
love
of
his
country
had
been
transferred
to
the
crown
that
his
national
delight
in
martial
glory
fixed
his
attachment
upon
the
monarch
as
the
leader
of
his
armies
and
that
this
feeling
had
supported
the
devotion
of
the
nation
to
louis
not
only
during
his
victories
but
even
amid
his
reverses
but
the
succeeding
reign
had
less
to
impose
on
the
imagination
the
erection
of
a
palace
obtains
for
the
nation
the
praise
of
magnificence
and
the
celebration
of
public
and
splendid
festivals
gives
the
people
at
least
the
pleasure
of
a
holiday
the
pensioning
artists
and
men
of
letters
again
is
honourable
to
the
country
which
fosters
the
arts
but
the
court
of
louis
undiminished
in
expense
was
also
selfish
in
its
expenditure
the
enriching
of
needy
favourites
their
relations
and
their
parasites
had
none
of
the
dazzling
munificence
of
the
grand
monarque
and
while
the
taxes
became
daily
more
oppressive
on
the
subjects
the
mode
in
which
the
revenue
was
employed
not
only
became
less
honourable
to
the
court
and
less
creditable
to
the
country
but
lost
the
dazzle
and
show
which
gives
the
lower
orders
pleasure
as
the
beholders
of
a
pageant
the
consolation
which
the
imagination
of
the
french
had
found
in
the
military
honour
of
their
nation
seemed
also
about
to
fail
them
the
bravery
of
the
troops
remained
the
same
but
the
genius
of
the
commanders
and
the
fortune
of
the
monarch
under
whose
auspices
they
fought
had
in
a
great
measure
abandoned
them
and
the
destiny
of
france
seemed
to
be
on
the
wane
the
victory
of
fontenoy
was
all
that
was
to
be
placed
in
opposition
to
the
numerous
disasters
of
the
seven
war
in
which
france
was
almost
everywhere
else
defeated
and
it
was
little
wonder
that
in
a
reign
attended
with
so
many
subjects
of
mortification
the
enthusiastic
devotion
of
the
people
to
the
sovereign
should
begin
to
give
way
the
king
had
engrossed
so
much
power
in
his
own
person
that
he
had
become
as
it
were
personally
responsible
for
every
miscarriage
and
defeat
which
the
country
underwent
such
is
the
risk
incurred
by
absolute
monarchs
who
are
exposed
to
all
the
popular
obloquy
for
maladministration
from
which
in
limited
governments
kings
are
in
a
great
measure
screened
by
the
intervention
of
the
other
powers
of

by
the
responsibility
of
ministers
for
the
measures
which
they
advise
while

that

the
actual
peak
and
extreme
summit
of

no
barrier
left
to
secure
him
from
the
tempest
another
and
most
powerful
cause
fanned
the
rising
discontent
with
which
the
french
of
the
eighteenth
century
began
to
regard
the
government
under
which
they
lived
like
men
awakened
from
a
flattering
dream
they
compared
their
own
condition
with
that
of
the
subjects
of
free
states
and
perceived
that
they
had
either
never
enjoyed
or
had
been
gradually
robbed
of
the
chief
part
of
the
most
valuable
privileges
and
immunities
to
which
man
may
claim
a
natural
right
they
had
no
national
representation
of
any
kind
and
but
for
the
slender
barrier
offered
by
the
courts
of
justice
or
parliaments
as
they
were
called
were
subject
to
unlimited
exactions
on
the
sole
authority
of
the
sovereign
the
property
of
the
nation
was
therefore
at
the
disposal
of
the
crown
which
might
increase
taxes
to
any
amount
and
cause
them
to
be
levied
by
force
if
force
was
necessary
the
personal
freedom
of
the
citizen
was
equally
exposed
to
aggressions
by
de
the
french
people
in
short
had
neither
in
the
strict
sense
liberty
nor
property
and
if
they
did
not
suffer
all
the
inconveniences
in
practice
which
so
evil
a
government
announces
it
was
because
public
opinion
the
softened
temper
of
the
age
and
the
good
disposition
of
the
kings
themselves
did
not
permit
the
scenes
of
cruelty
and
despotism
to
be
revived
in
the
eighteenth
century
which
louis
xi
had
practised
three
ages
before
these
abuses
and
others
arising
out
of
the
disproportioned
privileges
of
the
noblesse
and
the
clergy
who
were
exempted
from
contributing
to
the
necessities
of
the
state
the
unequal
mode
of
levying
the
taxes
and
other
great
errors
of
the
constitution
above
all
the
total
absorption
of
every
right
and
authority
in
the
person
of
the
sovereign
these
were
too
gross
in
their
nature
and
too
destructive
in
their
consequences
to
have
escaped
deep
thought
on
the
part
of
reflecting
persons
and
hatred
and
dislike
from
those
who
suffered
more
or
less
under
the
practical
evils
sidenote
suppression
of
free
discussion
they
had
not
in
particular
eluded
the
observation
and
censure
of
the
acute
reasoners
and
deep
thinkers
who
had
already
become
the
guiding
spirits
of
the
age
but
the
despotism
under
which
they
lived
prevented
those
speculations
from
assuming
a
practical
and
useful
character
in
a
free
country
the
wise
and
the
learned
are
not
only
permitted
but
invited
to
examine
the
institutions
under
which
they
live
to
defend
them
against
the
suggestions
of
rash
innovators
or
to
propose
such
alterations
as
the
lapse
of
time
and
change
of
manners
may
render
necessary
their
disquisitions
are
therefore
usefully
and
beneficially
directed
to
the
repair
of
the
existing
government
not
to
its
demolition
and
if
they
propose
alteration
in
parts
it
is
only
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
rest
of
the
fabric
but
in
france
no
opportunity
was
permitted
of
free
discussion
on
politics

more
than
on
matters
of
religion

essay
upon
the
french
monarchy

by
what
means
the
existing
institutions
might
have
been
brought
more
into
union
with
the
wishes
and
wants
of
the
people
must
have
procured
for
its
author
a
place
in
the
bastile
and
yet
subsequent
events
have
shown
that
a
system
which
might
have
introduced
prudently
and
gradually
into
the
decayed
frame
of
the
french
government
the
spirit
of
liberty
which
was
originally
inherent
in
every
feudal
monarchy
would
have
been
the
most
valuable
present
which
political
wisdom
could
have
rendered
to
the
country
the
bonds
which
pressed
so
heavily
on
the
subject
might
thus
have
been
gradually
slackened
and
at
length
totally
removed
without
the
perilous
expedient
of
casting
them
all
loose
at
once
but
the
philosophers
who
had
certainly
talents
sufficient
for
the
purpose
were
not
permitted
to
apply
to
the
state
of
the
french
government
the
original
principles
on
which
it
was
founded
or
to
trace
the
manner
in
which
usurpations
and
abuses
had
taken
place
and
propose
a
mode
by
which
without
varying
its
form
those
encroachments
might
be
restrained
and
those
abuses
corrected
an
author
was
indeed
at
liberty
to
speculate
at
any
length
upon
general
doctrines
of
government
he
might
imagine
to
himself
a
utopia
or
atalantis
and
argue
upon
abstract
ideas
of
the
rights
in
which
government
originates
but
on
no
account
was
he
permitted
to
render
any
of
his
lucubrations
practically
useful
by
adapting
them
to
the
municipal
regulations
of
france
the
political
sage
was
placed
with
regard
to
his
country
in
the
condition
of
a
physician
prescribing
for
the
favourite
sultana
of
some
jealous
despot
whom
he
is
required
to
cure
without
seeing
his
patient
and
without
obtaining
any
accurate
knowledge
of
her
malady
its
symptoms
and
its
progress
in
this
manner
the
theory
of
government
was
kept
studiously
separated
from
the
practice
the
political
philosopher
might
if
he
pleased
speculate
upon
the
former
but
he
was
prohibited
under
severe
personal
penalties
to
illustrate
the
subject
by
any
allusion
to
the
latter
thus
the
eloquent
and
profound
work
of
montesquieu
professed
indeed
to
explain
the
general
rights
of
the
people
and
the
principles
upon
which
government
itself
rested
but
his
pages
show
no
mode
by
which
these
could
be
resorted
to
for
the
reformation
of
the
constitution
of
his
country
he
laid
before
the
patient
a
medical
treatise
on
disease
in
general
instead
of
a
special
prescription
applying
to
his
peculiar
habits
and
distemper
in
consequence
of
these
unhappy
restrictions
upon
open
and
manly
political
discussion
the
french
government
in
its
actual
state
was
never
represented
as
capable
of
either
improvement
or
regeneration
and
while
general
and
abstract
doctrines
of
original
freedom
were
every
where
the
subject
of
eulogy
it
was
never
considered
for
a
moment
in
what
manner
these
new
and
more
liberal
principles
could
be
applied
to
the
improvement
of
the
existing
system
the
natural
conclusion
must
have
been
that
the
monarchical
government
in
france
was
either
perfection
in
itself
and
consequently
stood
in
need
of
no
reformation
or
that
it
was
so
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
liberties
of
the
people
as
to
be
susceptible
of
none
no
one
was
hardy
enough
to
claim
for
it
the
former
character
and
least
of
all
those
who
presided
in
its
councils
and
seemed
to
acknowledge
the
imperfection
of
the
system
by
prohibiting
all
discussion
on
the
subject
it
seemed
therefore
to
follow
as
no
unfair
inference
that
to
obtain
the
advantages
which
the
new
elementary
doctrines
held
forth
and
which
were
so
desirable
and
so
much
desired
a
total
abolition
of
the
existing
government
to
its
very
foundation
was
an
indispensable
preliminary
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
this
opinion
prevailed
so
generally
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
as
to
prevent
any
firm
or
resolute
stand
being
made
in
defence
even
of
such
of
the
actual
institutions
of
france
as
might
have
been
amalgamated
with
the
proposed
reform
sidenote
anglomania
while
all
practical
discussion
of
the
constitution
of
france
as
a
subject
either
above
or
beneath
philosophical
inquiry
was
thus
cautiously
omitted
in
those
works
which
pretended
to
treat
of
civil
rights
that
of
england
with
its
counterpoises
and
checks
its
liberal
principle
of
equality
of
rights
the
security
which
it
affords
for
personal
liberty
and
individual
property
and
the
free
opportunities
of
discussion
upon
every
topic
became
naturally
the
subject
of
eulogy
amongst
those
who
were
awakening
their
countrymen
to
a
sense
of
the
benefits
of
national
freedom
the
time
was
past
when
as
in
the
days
of
louis
the
french
regarded
the
institutions
of
the
english
with
contempt
as
fit
only
for
merchants
and
shopkeepers
but
unworthy
of
a
nation
of
warriors
whose
pride
was
in
their
subordination
to
their
nobles
as
that
of
the
nobles
consisted
in
obedience
to
their
king
that
prejudice
had
long
passed
away
and
frenchmen
now
admired
not
without
envy
the
noble
system
of
masculine
freedom
which
had
been
consolidated
by
the
successive
efforts
of
so
many
patriots
in
so
many
ages
a
sudden
revulsion
seemed
to
take
place
in
their
general
feelings
towards
their
neighbours
and
france
who
had
so
long
dictated
to
all
europe
in
matters
of
fashion
seemed
now
herself
disposed
to
borrow
the
more
simple
forms
and
fashions
of
her
ancient
rival
the
spirit
of
imitating
the
english
was
carried
even
to
the
verge
of
absurdity
not
only
did
frenchmen
of
quality
adopt
the
round
hat
and
frock
coat
which
set
etiquette
at
defiance
not
only
had
they
english
carriages
dogs
and
horses
but
even
english
butlers
were
hired
that
the
wine
which
was
the
growth
of
france
might
be
placed
on
the
table
with
the
grace
peculiar
to
england
these
were
indeed
the
mere
ebullitions
of
fashion
carried
to
excess
but
like
the
foam
on
the
crest
of
the
billow
they
argued
the
depth
and
strength
of
the
wave
beneath
and
insignificant
in
themselves
were
formidable
as
evincing
the
contempt
with
which
the
french
now
regarded
all
those
forms
and
usages
which
had
hitherto
been
thought
peculiar
to
their
own
country
this
principle
of
imitation
rose
to
such
extravagance
that
it
was
happily
termed
the
anglomania
while
the
young
french
gallants
were
emulously
employed
in
this
mimicry
of
the
english
fashions
relinquishing
the
external
signs
of
rank

always
produced
some
effect

vulgar

engaged

analyzing
those
principles
of

british
government
on
which
the
national
character
has
been
formed
and
which
have
afforded
her
the
means
of
rising
from
so
many
reverses

now
derive
them
from

into

principles
most
adverse

almost
alone
whether

whether
alarmed
already
at

whether
desirous

considered
that
there
ought
to
be
a
stronger
motive
for

than

for
which
the
colonies
had
taken
up
arms
against
the

country
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
if
they
returned
to
france
strongly
prepossessed
in
favour
of
a
cause
for
which
they
had
encountered
danger
and
in
which
they
had
reaped

inferior
officers
of
the
french
auxiliary
army
chiefly
men
of
birth
agreeably
to
the
existing
rules
of
the
french
service
belonged
most
of
them
to
the
class
of
country
nobles
who
from
causes
already
noticed
were
far
from
being
satisfied
with
the
system
which
rendered
their
rise
difficult
in
the
only
profession
which
their
prejudices
and
those
of
france
permitted
them
to
assume
the
proportion
of
plebeians
who
had
intruded
themselves
by
connivance
and
indirect
means
into
the
military
ranks
looked
with
eagerness
to
some
change
which
should
give
a
free
and
open
career
to
their
courage
and
their
ambition
and
were
proportionally
discontented
with
regulations
which
were
recently
adopted
calculated
to
render
their
rise
in
the
army
more
difficult
than
before
in
these
sentiments
were
united
the
whole
of
the
officers
and
the
ranks
of
the
common
soldiery
all
of
whom
confiding
in
their
own
courage
and
fortune
now
became
indignant
at
those
barriers
which
closed
against
them
the
road
to
military
advancement
and
to
superior
command
the
officers
of
superior
rank
who
derived
their
descent
from
the
high
noblesse
were
chiefly
young
men
of
ambitious
enterprise
and
warm
imaginations
whom
not
only
a
love
of
honour
but
an
enthusiastic
feeling
of
devotion
to
the
new
philosophy
and
the
political
principles
which
it
inculcated
had
called
to
arms
amongst
these
were
rochambeau
la
fayette
the
lameths
chastellux
ségur
and
others
of
exalted
rank
but
of
no
less
exalted
feelings
for
the
popular
cause
they
readily
forgot
in
the
full
current
of
their
enthusiasm
that
their
own
rank
in
society
was
endangered
by
the
progress
of
popular
opinions
or
if
they
at
all
remembered
that
their
interest
was
thus
implicated
it
was
with
the
generous
disinterestedness
of
youth
prompt
to
sacrifice
to
the
public
advantage
whatever
of
selfish
immunities
was
attached
to
their
own
condition
the
return
of
the
french
army
from
america
thus
brought
a
strong
body
of
auxiliaries
to
the
popular
and
now
prevalent
opinions
and
the
french
love
of
military
glory

had
so
long

safeguard
of

became
intimately
identified
with
that
distinguished
portion
of

had
been
so
lately
and
so
successfully
engaged
in
defending
the
claims
of
the
people
against
the
rights
of
an
established
government
their
laurels
were
green
and
newly
gathered
while
those
which
had
been
obtained
in
the
cause
of
monarchy
were
of
an
ancient
date
and
tarnished
by
the
reverses
of
the
seven
years
war
the
reception
of
the
returned
soldiery
and
their
leaders
was
proportionally
enthusiastic
and
it
became
soon
evident
that
when
the
eventful
struggle
betwixt
the
existing
monarchy
and
its
adversaries
should
commence
the
latter
were
to
have
the
support
in
sentiment
and
probably
in
action
of
that
distinguished
part
of
the
army
which
had
of
late
maintained
and
recovered
the
military
character
of
france
it
was
accordingly
from
its
ranks
that
the
revolution
derived
many
of
its
most
formidable
champions
and
it
was
their
example
which
detached
a
great
proportion
of
the
french
soldiers
from
their
natural
allegiance
to
the
sovereign
which
had
been
for
so
many
ages
expressed
in
their
of

which
was
revived

altered

of

might
have

at

had
the
state
of
the

of

permitted
the
monarch
to
temporize
with
the
existing
discontents
and
the
progress
of
new
opinions
without
increasing
the
taxes
of
a
people

greatly
overburdened

now

fully

that
these
burdens
were
unequally
imposed

sometimes
prodigally
dispensed
sidenote
derangement
of

a
government
like
an
individual
may
be
guilty
of
many
acts
both
of
injustice
and
folly
with
some
chance
of
impunity
provided
it
possess
wealth
enough
to
command
partisans
and
to
silence
opposition
and
history
shows
us
that
as
on
the
one
hand
wealthy
and
monarchs
have
usually
been
able
to
render
themselves
most
independent
of
their
subjects
so
on
the
other
it
is
from
needy
princes
and
when
exchequers
are
empty
that
the
people
have
obtained
grants
favourable
to
freedom
in
exchange
for
their
supplies
the
period
of
pecuniary
distress
in
a
government
if
it
be
that
when
the
subjects
are
most
exposed
to
oppression
is
also
the
crisis
in
which
they
have
the
best
chance
of
recovering
their
political
rights
it
is
in
vain
that
the
constitution
of
a
despotic
government
endeavours
in
its
forms
to
guard
against
the
dangers
of
such
conjunctures
by
vesting
in
the
sovereign
the
most
complete
and
unbounded
right
to
the
property
of
his
subjects
this
doctrine
however
ample
in
theory
can
not
in
practice
be
carried
beyond
certain
bounds
without
producing
either
privy
conspiracy
or
open
insurrection
being
the
violent
symptoms
of
the
outraged
feelings
and
exhausted
patience
of
the
subject
which
in
absolute
monarchies
supply
the
want
of
all
regular
political
checks
upon
the
power
of
the
crown
whenever
the
point
of
human
sufferance
is
exceeded
the
despot
must
propitiate
the
wrath
of
an
insurgent
people
with
the
head
of
his
minister
or
he
may
tremble
for
his
own
in
constitutions
of
a
less
determined
despotical
character
there
almost
always
arises
some
power
of
check
or
control
however
anomalous
which
balances
or
counteracts
the
arbitrary
exactions
of
the
sovereign
instead
of
the
actual
resistance
of
the
subjects
as
at
fez
or
constantinople
this
was
the
case
in
france
no
constitution
could
have
been
more
absolute
in
theory
than
that
of
france
for
two
hundred
years
past
in
the
matter
of
finance
but
yet
in
practice
there
existed
a
power
of
control
in
the
parliaments
and
particularly
in
that
of
paris
these
courts
though
strictly
speaking
they
were
constituted
only
for
the
administration
of
justice
had
forced
themselves
or
been
forced
by
circumstances
into
a
certain
degree
of
political
power
which
they
exercised
in
control
of
the
crown
in
the
imposition
of
new
taxes
it
was
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
royal
edicts
enforcing
such
new
impositions
must
be
registered
by
the
parliaments
but
while
the
crown
held
the
registering
such
edicts
to
be
an
act
purely
ministerial
and
the
discharge
of
a
function
imposed
by
official
duty
the
magistrates
insisted
on
the
other
hand
that
they
possessed
the
power
of
deliberating
and
remonstrating
nay
of
refusing
to
register
the
royal
edicts
the
parliaments
exercised
this
power
of
control
on
various
occasions
and
as
their
interference
was
always
on
behalf
of
the
subject
the
practice
however
anomalous
was
sanctioned
by
public
opinion
and
in
the
absence
of
all
other
representatives
of
the
people
france
naturally
looked
up
to
the
magistrates
as
the
protectors
of
her
rights
and
as
the
only
power
which
could
offer
even
the
semblance
of
resistance
to
the
arbitrary
increase
of
the
burdens
of
the
state
these
functionaries
can
not
be
charged
with
carelessness
or
cowardice
in
the
discharge
of
their
duty
and
as
taxes
increased
and
became
at
the
same
time
less
productive
the
opposition
of
the
parliaments
became
more
formidable
louis
xiv
endeavoured
to
break
their
spirit
by
suppression
of
their
court
and
banishment
of
its
members
from
paris
but
notwithstanding
this
temporary
victory
he
is
said
to
have
predicted
that
his
successor
might
not
come
off
from
the
renewed
contest
so
successfully
louis
with
the
plain
honesty
which
marked
his
character
restored
the
parliaments
to
their
constitutional
powers
immediately
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
having
the
generosity
to
regard
their
resistance
to
his
grandfather
as
a
merit
rather
than
an
offence
in
the
meanwhile
the
revenue
of
the
kingdom
had
fallen
into
a
most
disastrous
condition
the
continued
and
renewed
expense
of
unsuccessful
wars
the
supplying
the
demands
of
a
luxurious
court
the
gratifying
hungry
courtiers
and
enriching
needy
favourites
had
occasioned
large
deficits
upon
the
public
income
of
each
successive
year
the
ministers
meanwhile
anxious
to
provide
for
the
passing
moment
of
their
own
administration
were
satisfied
to
put
off
the
evil
day
by
borrowing
money
at
heavy
interest
and
leasing
out
in
security
of
these
loans
the
various
sources
of
revenue

on
their
part

financiers

feeding
their
extravagance
with
the
one
hand
with
the
other
wring
out
of

ruined
fortunes
the
most
unreasonable
recompense
for
their
advances
by
a
long
succession
of
these
ruinous
loans
and
the
various
rights
granted
to
guarantee
them
the
whole
finances
of
france
appear
to
have
fallen
into
total
confusion
and
presented
an
inextricable
chaos
to

who
endeavoured
to
bring
them
into

louis
fully
sensible
of
the
disastrous
state
of
the
public
revenue
did
all
he
could
to
contrive
a
remedy
he
limited
his
personal
expenses
and
those
of
his
household
with
a
rigour
which
approached
to
parsimony
and
dimmed
the
necessary
splendour
of
the
throne
he
abolished
many
pensions
and
by
doing
so
not
only
disobliged
those
who
were
deprived
of
the
instant
enjoyment
of
those
gratuities
but
lost
the
attachment
of
the
much
more
numerous
class
of
expectants
who
served
the
court
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
similar
gratifications
in
their
turn
lastly
he
dismissed
a
very
large
proportion
of
his
household
troops
and
affording
another
subject
of
discontent
to
the
nobles
out
of
whose
families
these
corps
were
recruited

destroying
with
his
own
hand
a
force
devotedly
attached
to
the
royal
person
and
which
in
the
hour
of
popular
fury
would
have
been
a
barrier
of
inappreciable
value
thus
it
was
the
misfortune
of
this
prince
only
to
weaken
his
own
cause
and
endanger
his
safety
by
those
sacrifices
intended
to
relieve
the
burdens
of
the
people
and
supply
the
wants
of
the
state
sidenote

the
king
adopted
a
broader
and
more
effectual
course
of
reform
by
using
the
advice
of
upright
and
skilful
ministers
to
introduce
as
far
as
possible
some
degree
of
order
into
the
french
finances
turgot
malesherbes
and
necker
were
persons
of
unquestionable
skill
of
sound
views
and
undisputed
integrity
and
although
the
minister
finally
sunk
in
public
esteem
it
was
only
because
circumstances
had
excited
such
an
extravagant
opinion
of
his
powers
as
could
not
have
been
met
and
realized
by
those
of

ever

these
virtuous
and
patriotic
statesmen

all
in
their
power
to
keep
afloat

prevent

the
increase
of
the
deficit
which
now
arose

find

patience

been

years

in

the

partook
the

of

along
with

there
seemed
just
reason
to
hope
that
had

louis
who
possessed
the
benevolence
and
good
intentions
of
his
ancestor
henry
wanted
his
military
talents
and
his
political
firmness
in
consequence
of
this
deficiency
the
king
suffered
himself
to
be
distracted
by
a
variety
of
counsels
and
vacillating
as
all
must
who
act
more
from
a
general
desire
to
do
that
which
is
right
than
upon
any
determined
and

he
placed
his

of
the
changeful
course
of
events
which
firmness
might
have
at

combated
if
it
could
not

it
is
remarkable
that
louis
resembled
charles

more
than
any
of
his

in
a
want
of
which
led
to
frequent

both

under
the

suspicion
of
being
deceitful
and
insincere
when
perhaps
charles

certainly
louis
only
changed
his
course
of
conduct
from
a
change
of
his
own
opinion
or
from
suffering
himself
to
be
and
deferring
to
the

of

few
monarchs
of
any
country
certainly
have
changed
their
ministry
and
with
their
ministry
their
counsels
and
measures
so
often
as
louis
xvi
and
with
this
unhappy
consequence
that
he
neither
persevered
in
a
firm
and
severe
course
of
government
long
enough
to
inspire
respect
nor
in
a
conciliatory
and
yielding
policy
for
a
sufficient
time
to
propitiate
regard
and
confidence
it
is
with
regret
we
notice
this
imperfection
in
a
character
otherwise
so
excellent
but
it
was
one
of
the
leading
causes
of
the
revolution
that
a
prince
possessed
of
power
too
great
to
be
either
kept
or
resigned
with
safety
hesitated
between
the
natural
resolution
to
defend
his
hereditary
prerogative
and
the
sense
of
justice
which
induced
him
to
restore
such
part
of
it
as
had
been
usurped
from
the
people
by
his
ancestors
by
adhering
to
the
one
course
he
might
have
been
the
conqueror
of
the
revolution
by
adopting
the
other
he
had
a
chance
to
be
its
guide
and
governor
by
hesitating
between
them
he
became
its
victim
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
vacillation
of
purpose
that
louis
in
sacrificed
turgot
and
necker
to
the
intrigues
of
the
court
these
statesmen
had
formed
a
plan
for
the
financial
part
of
the
french
monarchy
which
while
it
should
gratify
the
people
by
admitting
representatives
on
their
part
to
some
influence
in
the
imposition
of
new
taxes
might
have
released
the
king
from
the
interference
of
the
parliaments
whose
office
of
remonstrance
although
valuable
as
a
shelter
from
despotism
was
often
arbitrarily
and
even
factiously
exercised
and
have
transferred
to
the
direct
representatives
of
the
people
that
superintendence
which
ought
never
to
have
been
in
other
hands
for
this
purpose
the
ministers
proposed
to
institute
in
the
several
provinces
of
france
convocations
of
a
representative
nature
of
whom
was
to
be
chosen
from
the
commons
or
third
estate
and
the
other
named
by
the
nobles
and
clergy
in
equal
proportions
and
which
assemblies
without
having
the
right
of
rejecting
the
edicts
imposing
new
taxes
were
to
apportion
them
amongst
the
subjects
of
their
several
provinces
this
system
contained
in
it
much
that
was
excellent
and
might
have
opened
the
road
for
further
improvements
on
the
constitution
while
at
the
same
time
it
would
probably
so
early
as
have
been
received
as
a
boon
by
which
the
subjects
were
called
to
participate
in
the
royal
counsels
rather
than
as
a
concession
extracted
from
the
weakness
of
the
sovereign
or
from
his
despair
of
his
own
resources
it
afforded
also
an
opportunity
peculiarly
desirable
in
france
of
forming
the
minds
of
the
people
to
the
discharge
of
public
duty
the
british
nation
owe
much
of
the
practical
benefits
of
their
constitution
to
the
habits
with
which
almost
all
men
are
trained
to
exercise
some
public
right
in
vestries
and
other
deliberative
bodies
where
their
minds
are
habituated
to
the
course
of
business
and
accustomed
to
the
manner
in
which
it
can
be
most
regularly
despatched
this
advantage
would
have
been
supplied
to
the
french
by
necker
scheme
but
with
all
the
advantages
which
it
promised
this
plan
of
provincial
assemblies
miscarried
owing
to
the
emulous
opposition
of
the
parliament
of
paris
who
did
not
choose
that
any
other
body
than
their
own
should
be
considered
as
the
guardians
of
what
remained
in
france
of
popular
rights
sidenote
necker
compte

another
measure
of
necker
was
of
more
dubious
policy
this
was
the
printing
and
publishing
of
his
report
to
the
sovereign
of
the
state
of
the
revenues
of
france
the
minister
probably
thought
this
display
of
candour
which
however
proper
in
itself
was
hitherto
unknown
in
the
french
administration
might
be
useful
to
the
king
whom
it
represented
as
acquiescing
in
public
opinion
and
appearing
not
only
ready
but
solicitous
to
collect
the
sentiments
of
his
subjects
on
the
business
of
the
state
necker
might
also
deem
the
a
prudent
measure
on
his
own
account
to
secure
the
popular
favour
and
maintain
himself
by
the
public
esteem
against
the
influence
of
court
intrigue
or
lastly
both
these
motives
might
be
mingled
with
the
natural
vanity
of
showing
the
world
that
france
enjoyed
in
the
person
of
necker
a
minister
bold
enough
to
penetrate
into
the
labyrinth
of
confusion
and
obscurity
which
had
been
thought
inextricable
by
all
his
predecessors
and
was
at
length
enabled
to
render
to
the
sovereign
and
the
people
a
detailed
and
balanced
account
of
the
state
of
their
finances
neither
did
the
result
of
the
national
appear
so
astounding
as
to
require
its
being
concealed
as
a
state
mystery
the
deficit
or
the
balance
by
which
the
expenses
of
government
exceeded
the
revenue
of
the
country
by
no
means
indicated
a
desperate
state
of
finance
or
one
which
must
either
demand
immense
sacrifices
or
otherwise
lead
to
national
bankruptcy
it
did
not
greatly
exceed
the
annual
defalcation
of
two
millions
a
sum
which
to
a
country
so
fertile
as
france
might
even
be
termed
trifling
at
the
same
time
necker
brought
forward
a
variety
of
reductions
and
economical
arrangements
by
which
he
proposed
to
provide
for
this
deficiency
without
either
incurring
debt
or
burdening
the
subject
with
additional
taxes
but
although
this
general
exposure
of
the
expenses
of
the
state
this
appeal
from
the
government
to
the
people
had
the
air
of
a
frank
and
generous
proceeding
and
was
in
fact
a
step
to
the
great
constitutional
point
of
establishing
in
the
nation
and
its
representatives
the
sole
power
of
granting
supplies
there
may
be
doubt
whether
it
was
not
rather
too
hastily
resorted
to
those
from
whose
eyes
the
cataract

been
removed
are
for
some
time
deprived
of
light
and
in
the
end
it
is
supplied
to
them
by
limited
degrees
but
that
glare
which
was
at
once
poured
on
the
nation
of
france
served
to
dazzle
as
many
as
it
illuminated
the
was
the
general
subject
of
conversation
not
only
in
and
public
promenades
but
in
saloons
and
ladies
boudoirs
and
amongst
society
better
qualified
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
last
comedy
or
any
other
frivolity
of
the
day
the
very
array
of
figures
had
something
ominous
and
terrible
in
it
and
the
word
was
used
like
the
name
of
marlborough
of
old
to
frighten
children
with
to
most
it
intimated
the
total
bankruptcy
of
the
nation

prepared
many
to
act
with
the
selfish
and
shortsighted
license
of
sailors
who
plunder
the
cargo
of
their
own
vessel
in
the
act
of
shipwreck
others
saw
in
the
account
of
expenses
attached
to
the
person
and
dignity
of
the
prince
a
wasteful
expenditure
which
in
that
hour
of
avowed
necessity
a
nation
might
well
dispense
with
men
began
to
number
the
guards
and
household
pomp
of
the
sovereign
and
his
court

the

of

of

commenced

provident
persons
yet
farther
what
needs

no
doubt
some
even
at
this
early
period
arrived
at
the
ultimate
conclusion
what
needs
one
besides
the
domestic
and
household
expenses
of
the
sovereign
which
so
far
as
personal
were
on
the
most
moderate
scale
the
public
mind
was
much
more
justly
revolted
at
the
large
sum
yearly
squandered
among
needy
courtiers
and
their
dependents
or
even
less
justifiably
lavished
upon
those
whose
rank
and
fortune
ought
to
have
placed
them
far
above
adding
to
the
burdens
of
the
subjects
the
king
had
endeavoured
to
abridge
this
list
of
gratuities
and
pensions
but
the
system
of
corruption
which
had
prevailed
for
two
centuries
was
not
to
be
abolished
in
an
instant
the
throne
already
tottering
could
not
immediately
be
deprived
of
the
band
of
stipendiary
grandees
whom
it
had
so
long
maintained
and
who
afforded
it
their
countenance
in
return
and
it
was
perhaps
impolitic
to
fix
the
attention
of
the
public
on
a
disclosure
so
peculiarly
invidious
until
the
opportunity
of
correcting
it
should
arrive
it
was
like
the
disclosure
of
a
wasting
sore
useless
and
disgusting
unless
when
shown
to
a
surgeon
and
for
the
purpose
of
cure
yet
though
the
account
rendered
by
the
minister
of
the
finances
while
it
passed
from
the
hand
of
one
idler
to
another
and
occupied
on
sofas
and
toilettes
the
place
of
the
latest
novel
did
doubtless
engage
giddy
heads
in
vain
and
dangerous
speculation
something
was
to
be
risked
in
order
to
pave
the
way
of
regaining
for
the
french
subjects
the
right
most
essential
to
freemen
that
of
granting
or
refusing
their
own
supplies
the
publicity
of
the
distressed
state
of
the
finances
induced
a
general
conviction
that
the
oppressive
system
of
taxation
could
only
be
removed
and
that
approaching
bankruptcy
which
was
a
still
greater
evil
avoided
by
resorting
to
the
nation
itself
convoked
in
their
ancient
form
of
representation
which
was
called

was
true
that
through
length
of
time
the
nature
and
powers
of
this
body
were
forgotten
if
indeed
they
had
ever
been
very
thoroughly
fixed
and
it
was
also
true
that
the
constitution
of
the
of
which
was
the
last
date
of
their
being
assembled
was
not
likely
to
suit
a
period
when
the
country
was
so
much
changed
both
in
character
and
circumstances
the
doubts
concerning
the
composition
of
the
medicine
and
its
probable
effects
seldom
abate
the
confidence
all
joined
in
desiring
the
convocation
of
this
representative
body
and
all
expected
that
such
an
assembly
would
be
able
to
find
some
satisfactory
remedy
for
the
pressing
evils
of
the
state
the
cry
was
general
and
as
usual
in
such
cases
few
who
joined
in
it
knew
exactly
what
it
was

wanted

the
advantage
of

possible
to
see
a
chance

perhaps
a
doubtful
one
of
avoiding
the
universal
shipwreck
which
was
fated
to
ensue
if
the
royal
government
determining
to
gratify
the
general
wish
had
taken
the
initiative
in
conceding
the
great
national
measure
as
a
boon
flowing
from
the
prince
pure
and
love
of
his
subjects

if
measures
had
been
taken
rapidly
and
decisively
to
secure
seats
in
these
bodies
but
particularly
in
the
tiers

to
men
known
for
their
moderation
and
adherence
to
the
monarchy
it
seems
probable
that
the
crown
might
have
secured
such
an
interest
in
a
body
of
its
own
creation
as
would
have
silenced
the
attempts
of
any
heated
spirits
to
hurry

reverence
paid
to
the
throne

so
many
centuries

yet
all
the
influence
of
unassailed
sanctity

king
was
still
the
master
of
an
army
commanded
under
him
by
his
nobles
and
as
yet
animated
by
the
spirit
of
loyalty
which
is
the
natural
attribute
of
the
military
profession
the
minds
of
men
were
not
warmed
at
once
and
wearied
by
a
fruitless
and
chicaning
delay
which
only
showed
the
extreme
indisposition
of
the
court
to
grant
what
they
had
no
means
of
ultimately
refusing
nor
had
public
opinion
yet
been
agitated
by
the
bold
discussions
of
a
thousand
pamphleteers
who
under
pretence
of
enlightening
the
people
prepossessed
their
minds
with
the
most
extreme
ideas
of
the
popular
character
of
the
representation
of
the
tiers

and
its
superiority
over
every
other
power
of

ambitious
and
unscrupulous
men
would
then
hardly
have
had
the
time
or
boldness
to
form
those
audacious
pretensions
which
their
ancestors
dreamed
not
of
and
which
the
course
of
six
or
seven
years
of
protracted
expectation
and
successive
renewals
of
hope
succeeded
by
disappointment
enabled
them
to
mature

fatal
interval

to
intervene
between

inevitable
without
this
delay
the
king
invested
with

at
the

have
surrendered
with
a
good
grace
such
parts

power
as
were
inconsistent
with
the
liberal

conduct
of

appeared
it
could
not
have
been
very
formidable
considering
the
resources
of
so
rich
a
country
but
it
was
necessary
that
the
pressure
of
new
burdens
to
be
imposed
at
this
exigence
should
be
equally
divided
amongst
the
orders
of
the
state
the
third
estate
or
commons
had
been
exhausted
under
the
weight
of
taxes
which
fell
upon
them
alone
and
calonne
formed
the
bold
and
laudable
design
of
compelling
the
clergy
and
nobles
hitherto
exempted
from
taxation
to
contribute
their
share
to
the
revenues
of
the
state
this
however
was
in
the
present
state
of
the
public
too
bold
a
scheme
to
be
carried
into
execution
without
the
support
of
something
resembling
a
popular
representation
at
this
crisis
again
might
louis
have
summoned
the
with
some
chance
of
uniting
their
suffrages
with
the
wishes
of
the
crown
the
king
would
have
found
himself
in
a
natural
alliance
with
the
commons
in
a
plan
to
abridge
those
immunities
which
the
clergy
and
nobles
possessed
to
the
prejudice
of
the
third
estate
he
would
thus
in
the
outset
at
least
have
united
the
influence
and
interests
of
the
crown
with
those
of
the
popular
party
and
established
something
like
a
balance
in
the
representative
body
in
which
the
throne
must
have
had
considerable
weight
apparently
calonne
and
his
principal
vergennes
were
afraid
to
take
this
manly
and
direct
course
as
indeed
the
ministers
of
an
arbitrary
monarch
can
rarely
be
supposed
willing
to
call
in
the
aid
of
a
body
of
popular
representatives
the
ministers
endeavoured
therefore
to
supply
the
want
of
a
body
like
the
by
summoning
together
an
assembly
of
what
was
termed
the
notables
or
principal
persons
in
the
kingdom
this
was
in
every
sense
an
unadvised
measure
with
something
resembling
the
form
of
a
great
national
council
the
notables
had
no
right
to
represent
the
nation
neither
did
it
come
within
their
province
to
pass
any
resolution
whatever
their
post
was
merely
that
of
an
extraordinary
body
of
counsellors
who
deliberated
on
any
subject
which
the
king
might
submit
to
their
consideration
and
were
to
express
their
opinion
in
answer
to
the
sovereign
interrogatories
but
an
assembly
which
could
only
start
opinions
and
debate
upon
them
without
coming
to
any
effective
or
potential
decision
was
a
fatal
resource
at
a
crisis
when
decision
was
peremptorily
necessary
and
when
all
vague
and
irrelevant
discussion
was
as
at
a
moment
of
national
fermentation
to
be
cautiously
avoided
above
all
there
was
this
great
error
in
having
recourse
to
the
assembly
of
the
notables
that
consisting
entirely
of
the
privileged
orders
the
council
was
composed
of
the
individuals
most
inimical
to
the
equality
of
taxes
and
most
tenacious
of
those
very
immunities
which
were
struck
at
by
the
scheme
of
the
minister
of
finance
calonne
found
himself
opposed
at
every
point
and
received
from
the
notables
remonstrances
instead
of
support
and
countenance
that
assembly
censuring
all
his
plans
and
rejecting
his
proposals
he
was
in
their
presence
like
a
rash
necromancer
who
has
been
indeed
able
to
raise
a
demon
but
is
unequal
to
the
task
of
guiding
him
when
evoked
he
was
further
weakened
by
the
death
of
vergennes
and
finally
obliged
to
resign
his
place
and
his
country
a
sacrifice
at
once
to
court
intrigue
and
popular
odium
had
this
able
but
rash
minister
convoked
the
instead
of
the
notables
he
would
have
been
at
least
sure
of
the
support
of
the
third
estate
or
commons
and
allied
with
them
might
have
carried
through
so
popular
a
scheme
as
that
which
went
to
establish
taxation
upon
a
just
and
equal
principle
affecting
the
rich
as
well
as
the
poor
the
proud
prelate
and
wealthy
noble
as
well
as
the
industrious
cultivator
of
the
soil
calonne
having
retired
to
england
from
popular
hatred
his
perilous
office
devolved
upon
the
archbishop
of
sens
afterwards
the
cardinal
de
loménie
who
was
raised
to
the
painful
may
by
the
interest
of
the
unfortunate
marie
antoinette
whose
excellent
qualities
were
connected
with
a
spirit
of
proper
to
the
sex
in
such
elevated
situations
which
but
too
frequently
thwarted
or
bore
down
the
more
candid
intentions
of
her
husband
and
tended
though
on
her
part
unwittingly
to
give
his
public
measures
sometimes
adopted
on
his
own
principles
and
sometimes
influenced
by
her
intrigues
and
solicitations
an
appearance
of
vacillation
and
even
of
duplicity
which
greatly
injured
them
both
in
the
public
opinion
the
new
minister
finding
it
as
difficult
to
deal
with
the
assembly
of
notables
as
his
predecessor
the
king
finally
dissolved
that
body
without
having
received
from
them
either
the
countenance
or
good
counsel
which
had
been
expected
thus
realizing
the
opinion
expressed
by
voltaire
concerning
such
convocations
de
tous
ces
etats
le
plus
commun
est
de
voir
tous
nos
maux
sans
en
soulager
un
sidenote
bed
of
justice
after
dismission
of
the
notables
the
minister
adopted
or
recommended
a
line
of
conduct
so
fluctuating
and
indecisive
so
violent
at
one
time
in
support
of
the
royal
prerogative
and
so
pusillanimous
when
he
encountered
resistance
from
the
spirit
of
liberty
that
had
he
been
bribed
to
render
the
crown
at
once
odious
and
contemptible
or
to
engage
his
master
in
a
line
of
conduct
which
should
irritate
the
courageous
and
encourage
the
timid
among
his
dissatisfied
subjects
the
archbishop
of
sens
could
hardly
after
the
deepest
thought
have
adopted
measures
better
adapted
for
such
a
purpose
as
if
determined
to
bring
matters
to
an
issue
betwixt
the
king
and
the
parliament
of
paris
he
laid
before
the
latter
two
new
edicts
for
taxes
similar
in
most
respects
to
those
which
had
been
recommended
by
his
predecessor
calonne
to
the
notables
the
parliament
refused
to
register
these
edicts
being
the
course
which
the
minister
ought
to
have
expected
he
then
resolved
upon
a
display
of
the
royal
prerogative
in
its
most
arbitrary
and
obnoxious
form
a
bed
of
justice
as
it
was
termed
was
held
where
the
king
presiding
in
person
over
the
court
of
parliament
commanded
the
edicts
imposing
certain
new
taxes
to
be
registered
in
his
own
presence
thus
by
an
act
of
authority
emanating
directly
from
the
sovereign
beating
down
the
only
species
of
opposition
which
the
subjects
through
any
organ
whatever
could
offer
to
the
increase
of
taxation
the
parliament
yielded
the
semblance
of
a
momentary
obedience
but
protested
solemnly
that
the
edict
having
been
registered
solely
by
the
royal
command
and
against
their
unanimous
opinion
should
not
have
the
force
of
a
law
they
remonstrated
also
to
the
throne
in
terms
of
great
freedom
and
energy
distinctly
intimating
that
they
could
not
and
would
not
be
the
passive
instruments
through
the
medium
of
whom
the
public
was
to
be
loaded
with
new
impositions
and
they
expressed
for
the
first
time
in
direct
terms
the
proposition
fraught
with
the
fate
of
france
that
neither
the
edicts
of
the
king
nor
the
registration
of
those
edicts
by
the
parliament
were
sufficient
to
impose
permanent
burdens
on
the
people
but
such
taxation
was
competent
to
the
only
in
punishment
of
their
undaunted
defence
of
the
popular
cause
the
parliament
was
banished
to
troyes
the
government
thus
increasing
the
national
discontent
by
the
removal
of
the
principal
court
of
the
kingdom
and
by
all
the
evils
incident
to
a
delay
of
public
justice
the
provincial
parliaments
supported
the
principles
adopted
by
their
brethren
of
paris
the
chamber
of
accounts
and
the
court
of
aids
the
judicial
establishments
next
in
rank
to
that
of
the
parliament
also
remonstrated
against
the
taxes
and
refused
to
enforce
them
they
were
not
enforced
accordingly
and
thus
for
the
first
time
during
two
centuries
at
least
the
royal
authority
of
france
being
brought
into
direct
collision
with
public
opinion
and
resistance
was
by
the
energy
of
the
subject
compelled
to
retrograde
and
yield
ground
this
was
the
first
direct
and
immediate
movement
of
that
mighty
revolution
which
afterwards
rushed
to
its
crisis
like
a
rock
rolling
down
a
mountain
this
was
the
first
torch
which
was
actually
applied
to
the
various
combustibles
which
lay
scattered
through
france
and
which
we
have
endeavoured
to
analyze
the
flame
soon
spread
into
the
provinces
the
nobles
of
brittany
broke
out
into
a
kind
of
insurrection
the
parliament
of
grenoble
impugned
by
a
solemn
decree
the
legality
of
de
strange
and
alarming
fears
wild
and
boundless
hopes
inconsistent
rumours
a
vague
expectation
of
impending
events
all
contributed
to
agitate
the
public
mind
the
quick
and
mercurial
tempers
which
chiefly
distinguish
the
nation
were
half
maddened
with
suspense
while
even
the
dull
nature
of
the
lowest
and
most
degraded
of
the
community
felt
the
coming
impulse
of
extraordinary
changes
as
cattle
are
observed
to
be
disturbed
before
an
approaching
the
minister
could
not
sustain
his
courage
in
such
a
menacing
conjuncture
yet
unhappily
attempted
a
show
of
resistance
instead
of
leaving
the
king
to
the
influence
of
his
own
sound
sense
and
excellent
disposition
which
always
induced
him
to
choose
the
means
of
conciliation
there
was
indeed
but
one
choice
and
it
lay
betwixt
civil
war
or
concession
a
despot
would
have
adopted
the
former
course
and
withdrawing
from
paris
would
have
gathered
around
him
the
army
still
his
own
a
patriotic
monarch
and
such
was
louis
xvi
when
exercising
his
own
judgment
would
have
chosen
the
road
of
concession
yet
his
steps
even
in
retreating
would
have
been
so
firm
and
his
attitude
so
manly
that
the
people
would
not
have
ventured
to
ascribe
to
fear
what
flowed
solely
from
a
spirit
of
conciliation
but
the
conduct
of
the
minister
or
of
those
who
directed
his
motions
was
an
alternation
of
irritating
opposition
to
the
public
voice
and
of
submission
to
its
demands
which
implied
an
understanding
impaired
by
the
perils
of
the
conjuncture
and
unequal
alike
to
the
task
of
avoiding
them
by
concession
or
resisting
them
with
courage
the
king
indeed
recalled
the
parliament
of
paris
from
their
exile
coming
at
the
same
time
under
an
express
engagement
to
convoke
the
and
leading
the
subjects
of
course
to
suppose
that
the
new
imposts
were
to
be
left
to
their
consideration
but
as
if
to
irritate
men
minds
by
showing
a
desire
to
elude
the
execution
of
what
had
been
promised
the
minister
ventured
in
an
evil
hour
to
hazard
another
experiment
upon
the
firmness
of
their
nerves
and
again
to
commit
the
dignity
of
the
sovereign
by
bringing
him
personally
to
issue
a
command
which
experience
had
shown
the
parliament
were
previously
resolved
to
disobey
by
this
new
proceeding
the
king
was
induced
to
hold
what
was
called
a
royal
sitting
of
the
parliament
which
resembled
in
all
its
forms
a
bed
of
justice
except
that
it
seems
as
if
the
commands
of
the
monarch
were
esteemed
less
authoritative
when
so
issued
than
when
they
were
as
on
the
former
occasion
delivered
in
this
last
obnoxious
assembly
thus
at
less
advantage
than
before
and
at
all
events
after
the
total
failure
of
a
former
experiment
the
king
arrayed
in
all
the
forms
of
his
royalty
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
convoked
his
parliament
in
person
and
again
with
his
own
voice
commanded
the
court
to
register
a
royal
edict
for
a
loan
of
four
hundred
and
twenty
millions
of
francs
to
be
raised
in
the
course
of
five
years
this
demand
gave
occasion
to
a
debate
which
lasted
nine
hours
and
was
only
closed
by
the
king
rising
up
and
issuing
at
length
his
positive
and
imperative
orders
that
the
loan
should
be
registered
to
the
astonishment
of
the
meeting
the
first
prince
of
the
blood
the
duke
of
orleans
arose
as
if
in
reply
and
demanded
to
know
if
they
were
assembled
in
a
bed
of
justice
or
a
royal
sitting
and
receiving
for
answer
that
the
latter
was
the
quality
of
the
meeting
he
entered
a
solemn
protest
against
the
proceedings
nov
thus
was
the
authority
of
the
king
once
more
brought
in
direct
opposition
to
the
assertors
of
the
rights
of
the
people
as
if
on
purpose
to
show
in
the
face
of
the
whole
nation
that
its
terrors
were
only
those
of
a
phantom
whose
shadowy
bulk
might
overawe
the
timid
but
could
offer
no
real
cause
of
fear
when
courageously
opposed
the
minister
did
not
however
give
way
without
such
an
ineffectual
struggle
as
at
once
showed
the
weakness
of
the
royal
authority
and
the
willingness
to
wield
it
with
the
despotic
sway
of
former
times
two
members
of
the
parliament
of
paris
were
imprisoned
in
remote
fortresses
and
the
duke
of
orleans
was
sent
in
exile
to
his
estate
a
long
and
animated
exchange
of
remonstrances
followed
betwixt
the
king
and
the
parliament
in
which
the
former
acknowledged
his
weakness
even
by
entering
into
the
discussion
of
his
prerogative
as
well
as
by
the
concessions
he
found
himself
obliged
to
tender
meantime
the
archbishop
of
sens
nourished
the
romantic
idea
of
getting
rid
of
these
refractory
courts
entirely
and
at
the
same
time
to
evade
the
convocation
of
the
substituting
in
their
place
the
erection
of
a
or
ancient
feudal
court
composed
of
princes
peers
marshals
of
france
deputies
from
the
provinces
and
other
distinguished
persons
who
should
in
future
exercise
all
the
higher
and
nobler
duties
of
the
parliaments
thus
reduced
to
their
original
and
proper
duties
as
courts
of
justice
but
a
court
or
council
of
the
ancient
feudal
times
with
so
slight
an
infusion
of
popular
representation
could
in
no
shape
have
accorded
with
the
ideas
which
now
generally
prevailed
and
so
much
was
this
felt
to
be
the
case
that
many
of
the
peers
and
other
persons
nominated
members
of
the
declined
the
seats
proposed
to
them
and
the
whole
plan
fell
to
the
ground
sidenote
riots
and
insurrections
meantime
violence
succeeded
to
violence
and
remonstrance
to
remonstrance
the
parliament
of
paris
and
all
the
provincial
bodies
of
the
same
description
being
suspended
from
their
functions
and
the
course
of
regular
justice
of
course
interrupted
the
spirit
of
revolt
became
general
through
the
realm
and
broke
out
in
riots
and
insurrections
of
a
formidable
description
while
at
the
same
time
the
inhabitants
of
the
capital
were
observed
to
become
dreadfully
agitated
there
wanted
not
writers
to
fan
the
rising
discontent
and
what
seems
more
singular
they
were
permitted
to
do
so
without
interruption
notwithstanding
the
deepened
jealousy
with
which
free
discussion
was
now
regarded
in
france
libels
and
satires
of
every
description
were
publicly
circulated
without
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
suppress
the
publications
or
to
punish
their
authors
although
the
most
scandalous
attacks
on
the
royal
family
and
on
the
queen
in
particular
were
dispersed
along
with
these
political
effusions
it
seemed
as
if
the
arm
of
power
was
paralyzed
and
the
bonds
of
authority
which
had
so
long
fettered
the
french
people
were
falling
asunder
of
themselves
for
the
liberty
of
the
press
so
long
unknown
was
now
openly
assumed
and
exercised
without
the
government
daring
to
interfere
to
conclude
the
picture
as
if
god
and
man
had
alike
determined
the
fall
of
this
ancient
monarchy
a
hurricane
of
most
portentous
and
unusual
character
burst
on
the
kingdom
and
laying
waste
the
promised
harvest
far
and
wide
showed
to
the
terrified
inhabitants
the
prospect
at
once
of
poverty
and
famine
added
to
those
of
national
bankruptcy
and
a
distracted
government
the
latter
evils
seemed
fast
advancing
for
the
state
of
the
finances
became
so
utterly
desperate
that
louis
was
under
the
necessity
of
stopping
a
large
proportion
of
the
treasury
payments
and
issuing
bills
for
the
deficiency
at
this
awful
crisis
fearing
for
the
king
and
more
for
himself
the
archbishop
of
sens
retired
from
administration
and
left
the
monarch
while
bankruptcy
and
famine
threatened
the
kingdom
to
manage
as
he
might
amid
the
storms
which
the
measures
of
the
minister
himself
had
provoked
to
the
uttermost
sidenote
convoked
a
new
premier
and
a
total
alteration
of
measures
were
to
be
resorted
to
while
necker
the
popular
favourite
called
to
the
helm
of
the
state
regretted
with
bitter
anticipation
of
misfortune
the
time
which
had
been
worse
than
wasted
under
the
rule
of
the
archbishop
who
had
employed
it
in
augmenting
the
enemies
and
diminishing
the
resources
of
the
crown
and
forcing
the
king
on
such
measures
as
caused
the
royal
authority
to
be
generally
regarded
as
the
common
enemy
of
all
ranks
of
the
kingdom
to
redeem
the
royal
pledge
by
convoking
the
seemed
to
necker
the
most
fair
as
well
as
most
politic
proceeding
and
indeed
this
afforded
the
only
chance
of
once
more
reconciling
the
prince
with
the
people
though
it
was
now
yielding
that
to
a
demand
which
two
years
before
would
have
been
received
as
a
boon
we
have
already
observed
that
the
constitution
of
this
assembly
of
national
representatives
was
little
understood
though
the
phrase
was
in
the
mouth
of
every
one
it
was
to
be
the
panacea
to
the
disorders
of
the
nation
yet
men
knew
imperfectly
the
mode
of
composing
this
universal
medicine
or
the
manner
of
its
operation
or
rather
the
people
of
france
invoked
the
assistance
of
this
national
council
as
they
would
have
done
that
of
a
tutelary
angel
with
full
confidence
in
his
power
and
benevolence
though
they
neither
knew
the
form
in
which
he
might
appear
nor
the
nature
of
the
miracles
which
he
was
to
perform
in
their
behalf
it
has
been
strongly
objected
to
necker
that
he
neglected
on
the
part
of
the
crown
to
take
the
initiative
line
of
conduct
on
this
important
occasion
and
it
has
been
urged
that
it
was
the
duty
without
making
any
question
or
permitting
any
doubt
to
assume
that
mode
of
convening
the
states
and
regulating
them
when
assembled
which
should
best
tend
to
secure
the
tottering
influence
of
his
master
but
necker
probably
thought
the
time
was
past
in
which
this
power
might
have
been
assumed
by
the
crown
without
exciting
jealousy
or
opposition
the
royal
authority
he
might
recollect
had
been
of
late
years
repeatedly
strained
until
it
had
repeatedly
given
way
and
the
issue
first
of
the
bed
of
justice
and
then
of
the
royal
sitting
was
sufficient
to
show
that
words
of
authority
would
be
wasted
in
vain
upon
disobedient
ears
and
might
only
excite
a
resistance
which
would
prove
its
own
lack
of
power
it
was
therefore
advisable
not
to
trust
to
the
unaided
exercise
of
prerogative
but
to
strengthen
instead
the
regulations
which
might
be
adopted
for
the
constitution
of
the
by
the
approbation
of
some
public
body
independent
of
the
king
and
his
ministers
and
with
this
purpose
necker
convened
a
second
meeting
of
the
notables
november
and
laid
before
them
for
their
consideration
his
plan
for
the
constitution
of
the
there
were
two
great
points
submitted
to
this
body
concerning
the
constitution
of
the
i
in
what
proportion
the
deputies
of
the
three
estates
should
be
represented
ii
whether
when
assembled
the
nobles
clergy
and
third
estate
or
commons
should
act
separately
as
distinct
chambers
or
sit
and
vote
as
one
united
body
sidenote
the
tiers
etat
necker
a
minister
of
an
honest
and
candid
disposition
a
republican
also
and
therefore
on
principle
a
respecter
of
public
opinion
unhappily
did
not
recollect
that
to
be
and
accurate
public
opinion
should
be
founded
on
the
authority
of
men
of
talents
and
integrity
and
that
the
popular
mind
must
be
by
arguments
of
a
sound
and
virtuous
tendency
else
the
enemy
will
sow
tares
and
the
public
will
receive
it
in
the
absence
of
more
wholesome
grain
perhaps
also
this
minister
found
himself
less
in
his
element
when
treating
of
state
affairs
than
while
acting
in
his
proper
capacity
as
a
financier
however
that
may
be
necker
conduct
resembled
that
of
an
unresolved
general
who
directs
his
movements
by
the
report
of
a
council
of
war
he
did
not
sufficiently
perceive
the
necessity
that
the
measures
to
be
taken
should
originate
with
himself
rather
than
arise
from
the
suggestion
of
others
and
did
not
therefore
avail
himself
of
his
situation
and
high
popularity
to
recommend
such
general
preliminary
arrangements
as
might
preserve
the
influence
of
the
crown
in
the
without
encroaching
on
the
rights
of
the
subject
the
silence
of
necker
leaving
all
in
doubt
and
open
to
discussion
those
arguments
had
most
weight
with
the
public
which
ascribed
most
importance
to
the
third
estate
the
talents
of
the
nobles
and
clergy
might
be
considered
as
having
been
already
in
vain
appealed
to
in
the
two
sessions
of
the
notables
an
assembly
composed
chiefly
out
of
the
privileged
classes
and
whose
advice
and
opinion
had
been
given
without
producing
any
corresponding
good
effect
the
parliament
had
declared
themselves
incompetent
to
the
measures
necessary
for
the
exigencies
of
the
kingdom
the
course
adopted
by
the
king
indicated
doubt
and
uncertainty
if
not
incapacity
the
tiers
etat
therefore
was
the
body
of
counsellors
to
whom
the
nation
looked
at
this
critical
conjuncture
what
is
the
tiers
etat
formed
the
title
of
a
pamphlet
by
the
abbé
siêyes
and
the
answer
returned
by
the
author
was
such
as
augmented
all
the
magnificent
ideas
already
floating
in
men
minds
concerning
the
importance
of
this
order
the
tiers
etat
said
he
comprehends
the
whole
nation
of
france
excepting
only
the
nobles
and
clergy
this
view
of
the
matter
was
so
far
successful
that
the
notables
recommended
that
the
commons
or
third
estate
should
have
a
body
of
representatives
equal
to
those
of
the
nobles
and
the
clergy
united
and
should
thus
form
in
point
of
relative
numbers
the
moiety
of
the
whole
delegates
this
however
would
have
been
comparatively
of
small
importance
had
it
been
determined
that
the
three
estates
were
to
sit
deliberate
and
vote
not
as
a
united
body
but
in
three
several
chambers
necker
conceded
to
the
tiers
etat
the
right
of
double
representation
but
seemed
prepared
to
maintain
the
ancient
order
of
debating
and
voting
by
separate
chambers
the
crown
had
been
already
worsted
by
the
rising
spirit
of
the
country
in
every
attempt
which
it
had
made
to
stand
through
its
own
unassisted
strength
and
torn
as
the
bodies
of
the
clergy
and
nobles
were
by
internal
dissensions
and
weakened
by
the
degree
of
popular
odium
with
which
they
were
loaded
it
would
have
required
an
artful
consolidation
of
their
force
and
an
intimate
union
betwixt
them
and
the
crown
to
maintain
a
balance
against
the
popular
claims
of
the
commons
likely
to
be
at
once
so
boldly
urged
by
themselves
and
so
favourably
viewed
by
the
nation
all
this
was
however
left
in
a
great
measure
to
accident
while
every
chance
was
against
its
being
arranged
in
the
way
most
advantageous
to
the
monarchy
the
minister
ought
also
in
policy
to
have
paved
the
way
for
securing
a
party
in
the
third
estate
itself
which
should
bear
some
character
of
royalism
this
might
doubtless
have
been
done
by
the
usual
ministerial
arts
of
influencing
elections
or
gaining
over
to
the
some
of
the
many
men
of
talents
who
determined
to
raise
themselves
in
this
new
world
had
not
yet
settled
to
which
side
they
were
to
give
their
support
but
necker
less
acquainted
with
men
than
with
mathematics
imagined
that
every
member
had
intelligence
enough
to
see
the
measures
best
calculated
for
the
public
good
and
virtue
enough
to
follow
them
faithfully
and
exclusively
it
was
in
vain
that
the
marquis
de
bouillé
pointed
out
the
dangers
arising
from
the
constitution
assigned
to
the
and
insisted
that
the
minister
was
arming
the
popular
part
of
the
nation
against
the
two
privileged
orders
and
that
the
latter
would
soon
experience
the
effects
of
their
hatred
animated
by
and
vanity
the
most
active
passions
of
mankind
necker
calmly
replied
that
there
was
a
necessary
reliance
to
be
placed
on
the
virtues
of
the
human
heart
the
maxim
of
a
worthy
man
but
not
of
an
enlightened
statesman
who
has
but
too
much
reason
to
know
how
often
both
the
virtues
and
the
prudence
of
human
nature
are
surmounted
by
its
prejudices
and
passions
it
was
in
this
state
of
doubt
and
total
want
of
preparation
that
the
king
was
to
meet
the
representatives
of
the
people
whose
elections
had
been
trusted
entirely
to
chance
without
even
an
attempt
to
influence
them
in
favour
of
the
most
eligible
persons
yet
surely
the
crown
hitherto
almost
the
sole
acknowledged
authority
in
france
should
have
been
provided
with
supporters
in
the
new
authority
which
was
to
be
assembled
at
least
the
minister
might
have
been
prepared
with
some
system
or
plan
of
proceeding
upon
which
this
most
important
convention
was
to
conduct
its
deliberations
but
there
was
not
even
an
attempt
to
take
up
the
reins
which
were
floating
on
the
necks
of
those
who
were
for
the
first
time
harnessed
to
the
chariot
of
the
state
all
was
expectation
mere
vague
and
unauthorised
hope
that
in
this
multitude
of
counsellors
there
would
be
found

have
described
the
silent

smooth

swift
and
powerful
stream
of
innovation

it
rolled

it

the

it

appeared
that
this
third
estate
which
in
the
year
the
nobles
had
refused
to
acknowledge
even
as
a
younger
brother
of

order

was
clearly

that
the
wishes

of
the
public
were
exclusively
fixed
upon
the
representatives
of
the
commons
the
rich
garments

floating
plumes
of
the
nobility
and
the
reverend
robes
of
the

had
nothing
to
fix
the
public
eye
their
sounding
and
emphatic
titles
had
nothing
to
win

ear

recollection
of

the

the
spectators
all
eyes
were
turned
on
the
members
of
the
third

in
a
plebeian
and
humble
costume
corresponding
to
their
lowly
birth
and
occupation
as
the

assert
that
the
body
which
thus
engrossed
the
national
attention
was
devoid
of
talents
to
deserve
it
on
the
contrary
the
tiers
etat
contained
a
large
proportion
of
the
learning
the
intelligence
and
the
eloquence
of
the
kingdom

unhappily
it
was
composed
of
men
of
theory
rather
than
of
practice
men
more
prepared
to
change
than
to
preserve
or
repair
and
above
all
of

generally
speaking
were
not
directly
concerned
in
the

of
peace
and
order

possessing
a

property
in
the
country
the
due
proportion
in
which
talents
and

are
represented
in
the
british
house

perhaps
the
best
assurance
for
the

to

those

men
of

desirous

in

history
of

centuries
it
is
easy
to
see
how
much
practical
wisdom
has
been
derived
from
the
influence
exercised
by
those
members
called
country
gentlemen
who
unambitious
of
distinguishing
themselves
by
their
eloquence
and
undesirous
of
mingling
in
the
ordinary
debates
of
the
house
make
their
sound
and
unsophisticated

understood
upon
every
crisis
of
importance
in
a
manner
alike
respected
by
the

the
opposition
of
the
day
by
the
professed
statesmen
of
the
house
whose
daily
business
is
legislation
and
whose
thoughts
in
some
instances
are
devoted
to
public
affairs
because
they
have
none
of
their
own
much
worth
looking
after
in
this
great
and
most
important
characteristic
of
representation
the
tiers
etat
of
france
was
necessarily
deficient
in
fact
the
part
of
the
french
constitution
which
without
exactly
corresponding
to
the
country
gentlemen
of
england
most
nearly
resembled
them
was
a
proportion
of
the
rural
noblesse
of
france
who
were
represented
amongst
the
estate
of
the
nobility
an
edict
detaching
these
rural
proprietors
and
perhaps
the
inferior
clergy
from
their
proper
orders
and
including
their
representatives
in
that
of
the
tiers
etat
would
have
infused
into
the
latter
assembly
a
proportional
regard
for
the
rights
of
landholders
whether
lay
or
clerical
and
as
they
must
have
had
a
voice
in
those
anatomical
experiments
of
which
their
property
was
about
to
become
the
subject
it
may
be
supposed
they
would
have
resisted
the
application
of
the
scalpel
excepting
when
it
was
unavoidably
necessary
instead
of
which
both
the
nobles
and
clergy
came
soon
to
be
placed
on
the
anatomical
table
at
the
mercy
of
each
who
having
no
interest
in
their
sufferings
thought
them
excellent
subjects
on
which
to
exemplify
some
favourite
hypothesis
while
owners
of
extensive
landed
property
were
in
a
great
measure
excluded
from
the
representation
of
the
third
estate
its
ranks
were
filled
from
those
classes
which
seek
novelties
in
theory
and
which
are
in
the
habit
of
profiting
by
them
in
practice
there
were
professed
men
of
letters
called
thither
as
they
hoped
and
expected
to
realize
theories
for
the
greater
part
inconsistent
with
the
present
state
of
things
in
which
to
use
one
of
their
own
choicest
mind
had
not
yet
acquired
its
due
rank
there
were
many
of
the
inferior
branches
of
the
law
for
unhappily
in
this
profession
also
the
graver
and
more
enlightened
members
were
called
by
their
rank
to
the
estate
of
the
noblesse
to
these
were
united
churchmen
without
livings
and
physicians
without
patients
men
whose
education
generally
makes
them
important
in
the
humble
society
in
which
they
move
and
who
are
proportionally
presumptuous
and
conceited
of
their
own
powers
when
advanced
into
that
which
is
superior
to
their
usual
walk
there
were
many
bankers
also
speculators
in
politics
as
in
their
natural
employment
of
and
there
were
intermingled
with
the
classes
we
have
noticed
some
individual
nobles
expelled
from
their
own
ranks
for
want
of
character
who
like
the
dissolute
mirabeau
a
moral
monster
for
talents
and
want
of
principle
menaced
from
the
station
which
they
had
assumed
the
rights
of
the
order
from
which
they
had
been
expelled
and
like
deserters
of
every
kind
were
willing
to
guide
the
foes
to
whom
they
had
fled
into
the
intrenchments
of
the
friends
whom
they
had
forsaken
or
by
whom
they
had
been
exiled
there
were
also
mixed
with
these
perilous
elements
many
individuals
not
only
endowed
with
talents
and
integrity
but
possessing
a
respectable
proportion
of
sound
sense
and
judgment
but
who
unfortunately
aided
less
to
counteract
the
revolutionary
tendency
than
to
justify
it
by
argument
or
dignify
it
by
example
from
the
very
beginning
the
tiers
etat
evinced
a
determined
purpose
to
annihilate
in
consequence
if
not
in
rank
the
other
two
orders
of
the
state
and
to
engross
the
whole
power
into
their
own
hands
sidenote
views
of
the

it
must
be
allowed
to
the
commons
that
the
noblesse
had
possessed
themselves
of
a
paramount
superiority
over
the
middle
class
totally
inconsistent
with
the
just
degree
of
consideration
due
to
their
and
irreconcilable
with
the
spirit
of
enlightened
times
they
enjoyed
many
privileges
which
were
humiliating
to
the
rest
of
the
nation
and
others
that
were
grossly
unjust
among
which
must
be
reckoned

immunities
from
taxation

as
an
estate
of
the
kingdom

felt
the

attached
to
the
privileges
of
their
order
showed
little
readiness
to
make
the
sacrifices
which
the
times
demanded
though
at
the
risk
of
having
what
they
refused
to
grant
forcibly
wrested
from
them
they
were
publicly

imprudently
tenacious
when
both
on
principle

in
policy
they
should
have
been
compliant
and
accommodating
for
their
own
sake
as
well
as
that

let
us
be
just
to
that
gallant
and
unfortunate
body
of
men
they
possessed
the
courage
if
not
the
skill
or
strength
of
their
ancestors
and
while
we
blame
the
violence
with
which
they
clung
to
useless
and
antiquated
privileges
let
us
remember
that
these
were
a
part
of
their
inheritance
which
no
man
renounces
willingly
and
no
man
of
spirit
yields
up
to
threats
if
they
erred
in
not
adopting
from
the
beginning
a
spirit
of
conciliation
and
concession
no
body
of
men
ever
suffered
so
cruelly
for
hesitating
to
obey
a
summons
which
called
them
to
acts
of
such
unusual
the
clergy
were
no
less
tenacious
of
the
privileges
of
the
church
than
the
noblesse
of
their
peculiar
feudal
immunities
it
had
been
already
plainly
intimated
that
the
property
of
the
clerical
orders
ought
to
be
subject
as
well
as
all
other
species
of
property
to
the
exigencies
of
the
state
and
the
philosophical
opinions
which
had
impugned
their
principles
of

and
rendered
their
persons
ridiculous

to
be
feared

those
by
whom
they
were
entertained
to
extend
their
views
to
a
general

of
the
whole

of

aloof

by
the
manner
in

private
interests

stood
committed

endeavoured
to
avert

coming
storm
by
retarding
the
deliberations
of
the
they
were
particularly
desirous
to
secure
their
individual
importance
as
distinct
orders
and
appealed
to
ancient
practice
and
the
usage
of
the
year
by
which
the
three
several
estates
sat
and
voted
in
three
separate
bodies
but
the
tiers
etat
who
from
the
beginning
felt
their
own
strength
were
determined
to
choose
that
mode
of
procedure
by
which
their
force
should
be
augmented
and
consolidated

double

rendered
them
equal
in
numbers
to
both

as
they
were
sure
of
some
interest
among
the
inferior
noblesse
and
a
very
considerable
party
amongst
the
lower
clergy
the
assistance
of
these
two
minorities
added
to
their
own
numbers
must
necessarily
give
them
the
superiority
in
every
vote
providing
the
three
chambers
could
be
united
into
one
on
the
other
hand
the
clergy
and
nobles
saw
that
a
union
of
this
nature
would
place
all
their
privileges
and
property
at
the
mercy
of
the
commons
whom
the
union
of
the
chambers
in
one
assembly
would
invest
with
an
overwhelming
majority
in
that
convocation
they
had
no
reason
to
expect
that
this
power
if
once
acquired
would
be
used
with
moderation
for
not
only
had
their
actually
obnoxious
privileges
been
assailed
by
every
battery
of
reason
and
of
ridicule
but
the
records
of
former
ages
had
been
ransacked
for
ridiculous
absurdities
and
detestable
cruelties
of
the
possessors
of
feudal
power
all
which
were
imputed
to
the
present
privileged
classes
and
mingled
with
many
fictions
of
unutterable
horror
devised
on
purpose
to
give
a
yet
darker
colouring
to
the
system
which
it
was
their
object
to
destroy
every
motive

induced
the
two
first
chambers
aware
of
the
possession
which
the
third
had
obtained
over
the
public
mind
to
maintain
if
possible
the
specific
individuality
of
their
separate
classes
and

right
hitherto
supposed
to
be
vested
in
them

protecting
their
own
interests
by
their
own
separate
votes

bodies

with
a
deeper
view

on

selfish
reasoning

much
hazard
in
amalgamating

whole
force
of
the
state

that
which
remained
in
the
crown
into
one
powerful
body
subject
to
all
the
hasty
impulses
to
which
popular
assemblies
lie
exposed
as
lakes
to
the
wind
and
in
placing
the
person
and
authority
of
the
king
in
solitary
and
diametrical
opposition
to
what
must
necessarily
in
moments
of
enthusiasm
appear
to
be
the
will
of
the
whole
people

statesmen
would
have
preferred
retaining
an
intermediate
check
upon
the
popular
counsels
of
the
tiers
etat
by
the
other
two
chambers
which
might
as
in
england
have
been
united
into
one
and
would
have
presented
an
imposing
front
both
in
point
of
wealth
and
property
and
through
the
respect
which
excepting
under
the
influence
of
extraordinary
emotion
the
people
in
spite
of
themselves
can
not
help
entertaining
for
birth
and
rank
such
a
body
providing
the
stormy
temper
of
the
times

admitted
of
its
foundations
being
laid
sufficiently
strong
would
have
served
as
a
breakwater
betwixt
the
throne
and
the
streamtide
of

opinion
and
the
monarch
would
have
been
spared
the
painful
and
perilous
task
of
opposing
himself
personally
directly

without
screen
or
protection
of
any
kind

the
democratical
part
of

would
have
been
obtained
for
reviewing
more
coolly
those
measures
which
might
have
passed
hastily
through
the
assembly

it
is
observed
in
the
history
of
innovation
that
the
indirect
and
unforeseen
consequences
of
every
great
change
of
an
existing
system
are
more
numerous

extensive

which
had

calculated
upon

those
who
opposed
the
alteration

advantages
of

constitution
in
which
each
measure
of
legislation
must
necessarily
be
twice
deliberately
argued
by
separate
senates
acting
under
different
impressions
and
interposing
at
the
same
time
a
salutary
delay
during
which
heats
may
subside
and

views
be
corrected

no
further
illustration
sidenote
influence
of
the
tiers
etat
it
must
be
owned
nevertheless
that
there
existed
the
greatest
difficulty
in
any
attempt
which
might
have
been
made
to
give
weight
to
the
nobles
as
a
separate
chamber
the
community
at
large
looked
to
reforms
deeply
affecting
the
immunities
of
the
privileged
classes
as
the
most
obvious
means
for
the
regeneration
of
the
kingdom
at
large
and
must
have
seen
with
jealousy
an
institution
like
an
upper
house
which
placed
the
parties
who
were
principally
to
suffer
these
changes
in
a
condition
to
impede
or
altogether
prevent
them
it
was
naturally
to
be
expected
that
the
clergy
and
nobles
united
in
an
upper
house
must
have
become
somewhat
partial
judges
in
the
question
of
retrenching
and
limiting
their
own
exclusive
privileges
and
besides
the
which
the
commons
bore
them
as
the
possessors
and
assertors
of
rights
infringing
on
the
liberties
of
the
people
it
might
be
justly
apprehended
that
if
the
scourge
destined
for
them
were
placed
in
their
own
hand
they
might
use
it
with
the
chary
moderation
of
the
squire
in
the
romance
of
cervantes
there
would
also
have
been
reason
to
doubt
that
when
the
nation
was
so
much
divided
by
factions
two
houses
so
different
in
character
and
composition
could
hardly
have
been
brought
to
act
with
firmness
and
liberality
towards
each
other
that
the
one
would
have
been
ever
scheming
for
the
recovery
of
their
full
privileges
supposing
they
had
been
obliged
to
surrender
a
part
of
them
while
the
other
would
still
look
forward
to
the
accomplishment
of
an
entirely
democratical
revolution
in
this
way
the
checks
which
ought
to
have
acted
merely
to
restrain
the
violence
of
either
party
might
operate
as
the
means
of
oversetting
the
constitution
which
they
were
intended
to
preserve
still
it
must
be
observed
that
while
the
king
retained
any
portion
of
authority
he
might
with
the
countenance
of
the
supposed
upper
chamber
or
senate
have
balanced
the
progress
of
democracy
difficult
as
the
task
might
be
an
attempt
towards
it
ought
to
have
been
made
but
unhappily
the
king
ear
was
successively
occupied
by
two
sets
of
advisers
one
of
whom
counselled
him
to
surrender
every
thing
to
the
humour
of
the
reformers
of
the
state
while
the
other
urged
him
to
resist
their
most
reasonable
wishes
without
considering
that
he
had
to
deal
with
those
who
had
the
power
to
take
by
force
what
was

to

and
malouet
advocated
the
establishment
of
two
chambers
in
the
tiers
etat
and
necker
was
certainly
favourable
to
some
plan
of
the
kind
but
the
noblesse
thought
it
called
upon
them
for
too
great
a
sacrifice
of
their
privileges
though
it
promised
to
ensure
what
remained
while
the
democratical
part
of
the
tiers
etat
opposed
it
obstinately
as
tending
to
arrest
the
march
of
the
revolutionary
impulse
five
or
six
weeks
elapsed
in
useless
debates
concerning
the
form
in
which
the
estates
should
vote
during
which
period
the
tiers
etat
showed
by
their
boldness
and
decision
that
they
knew
the
advantage
which
they
held
and
were
sensible
that
the
other
bodies
if
they
meant
to
retain
the
influence
of
their
situation
in
any
shape
must
unite
with
them
on
the
principle
according
to
which
smaller
drops
of
water
are
attracted
by
the
larger
this
came
to
pass
accordingly
the
tiers
etat
were
joined
by
the
whole
body
of
inferior
clergy
and
by
some
of
the
nobles
and
on
june
proceeded
to
constitute
themselves
a
legislative
body
exclusively
competent
in
itself
to
the
entire
province
of
legislation
and
renouncing
the
name
of
the
third
estate
which
reminded
men
they
were
only
one
out
of
three
bodies

adopted
that
of
the
national
assembly
and
avowed
themselves
not
merely
the
third
branch
of
the
representative
body
but
the
sole
representatives
of
the
people
of
france
nay
the
people
themselves
wielding
in
person
the
whole
gigantic
powers
of
the
realm

now
claimed
the
character

body

longer

to
the
task
of
merely
requiring
a
redress
of
grievances
for
which
they
had
been
originally
appointed
but
warranted
to
destroy
and
rebuild
whatever
they
thought
proper
in
the
constitution
of
the
state
it
is
not
easy
on
any
ordinary
principle
to
see
how
a
representation
convoked
for
a
certain
purpose
and
with
certain
limited
powers
should
thus
essentially
alter
their
own
character
and
set
themselves
in
such
a
different
relation
to
the
crown
and
the
nation
from
that
to
which
their
commissions
restricted
them
but
the
national
assembly
were
well
aware
that
in
extending
their
powers
far
beyond
the
terms
of
these
commissions
they
only
fulfilled
the
wishes
of
their
constituents
and
that
in
assuming
to
themselves
so
ample
an
authority
they
would
be
supported
by
the
whole
nation
excepting
the
privileged
orders
the
national
assembly
proceeded
to
exercise
their
power
with
the
same
audacity
which
they
had
shown
in
assuming
it
they
passed
a
sweeping
decree
by
which
they
declared
all
the
existing
taxes
to
be
illegal
impositions
the
collection
of
which
they
sanctioned
only
for
the
present
and
as
an
interim

should

the

asserted
in

latter
character
terrified
and
it
was
little
wonder
at
the
sudden
rise
of
this
gigantic
and
fabric
louis
became
inclined
to
listen
to
those
who
counselled
him
to
combat
this
new
and
formidable
authority
by
opposing
to
it
the
weight
of
royal
power
to
be
exercised
however
with
such
attention
to
the
popular
opinions
and
with
such
ample
surrender
of
the
obnoxious
part
of
the
royal
prerogative
as
might
gratify
the
rising
spirit
of
freedom
for
this
purpose
a
royal
sitting
was
appointed
at
which
the
king
in
person
was
to
meet
the
three
estates
of
his
kingdom
and
propose
a
scheme
which
it
was
hoped
might
unite
all
parties
and
tranquillize
all
minds
the
name
and
form
of
this
was
perhaps
not
well
chosen
as
being
too
nearly
allied
to
those
of
a
bed
of
justice
in
which
the
king
was
accustomed
to
exercise
imperative
authority
over
the
parliament
and
the
proceeding
was
calculated
to
awaken
recollection
of
the
highly
unpopular
royal
sitting
of
the
november
the
displacing
of
necker
and
the
banishment
of
the
duke
of
orleans
but
as
if
this
had
not
been
sufficient
an
unhappy
accident
which
almost
resembled
a
fatality
deranged
this
project
destroyed
all
the
grace
which
might
on
the
king
part
have
attended
the
measure
and
in
place
of
it
threw
upon
the
court
the
odium
of
having
indirectly
attempted
the
forcible
dissolution
of
the
assembly
while
it
invested
the
members
of
that
body
with
the
popular
character
of
steady
patriots
whose
union
courage
and
presence
of
mind
had
foiled
the
stroke
of
authority
which
had
been
aimed
at
their
existence
the
hall
of
the
commons
was
fixed
upon
for
the
purposes
of
the
royal
sitting
as
the
largest
of
the
three
which
were
occupied
by
the
three
estates
and
workmen
were
employed
in
making
the
necessary
arrangements
and
alterations
these
alterations
were
imprudently
commenced
june
before
holding
any
communication
on
the
subject
with
the
national
assembly
and
it
was
simply
notified
to
their
president
bailli
by
the
master
of
the
royal
ceremonies
that
the
king
had
suspended
the
meeting
of
the
assembly
until
the
royal
sitting
should
have
taken
place
bailli
the
president
well
known
afterwards
by
his
tragical
fate
refused
to
attend
to
an
order
so
intimated
and
the
members
of
assembly
upon
resorting
to
their
ordinary
place
of
meeting
found
it
full
of
workmen
and
guarded
by
soldiers
this
led
to
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
scenes
of
the
revolution
the
representatives
of
the
nation
thus
expelled
by
armed
guards
from
their
proper
place
of
assemblage
found
refuge
in
a
common
while
a
emblem
of
the
moral
tempest
which
raged
on
the
earth
poured
down
its
terrors
from
the
heavens
it
was
thus
that
exposed
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
and
with
the
wretched
accommodations
which
such
a
place
afforded
the
members
of
assembly
took
and
attested
by
their
respective
signatures
a
solemn
oath
to
continue
their
sittings
until
the
constitution
of
the
kingdom
and
the
regeneration
of
the
public
order
should
be
established
on
a
solid
basis
the
scene
was
of
a
kind
to
make
the
deepest
impression
both
on
the
actors
and
the
spectators
although
looking
back
at
the
distance
of
so
many
years
we
are
tempted
to
ask
at
what
period
the
national
assembly
would
have
been
dissolved
had
they
adhered
literally
to
their
celebrated
oath
but
the
conduct
of
the
government
was
in
every
respect
worthy
of
censure
the
probability
of
this
extraordinary
occurrence
might
easily
have
been
foreseen
if
mere
want
of
consideration
gave
rise
to
it
the
king
ministers
were
most
culpably
careless
if
the
closing
of
the
hall
and
suspending
of
the
sittings
of
the
assembly
was
intended
by
way
of
experiment
upon
its
temper
and
patience
it
was
an
act
of
madness
equal
to
that
of
irritating
an
already
exasperated
lion
be
this
however
as
it
may
the
conduct
of
the
court
had
the
worst
possible
effect
on
the
public
mind
and
prepared
them
to
view
with
dislike
and
suspicion
all
propositions
emanating
from
the
throne
while
the
magnanimous
firmness
and
unanimity
of
the
assembly
seemed
that
of
men
determined
to
undergo
martyrdom
rather
than
desert
the
assertion
of
their
own
rights
and
those
of
the
people
at
the
royal
sitting
which
took
place
three
days
after
the
vow
of
the
a
plan
was
proposed
by
the
king
offering
such
security
for
the
liberty
of
the
subject
as
would
a
year
before
have
been
received
with
grateful
rapture
but
it
was
the
unhappy
fate
of
louis
xvi
neither
to
recede
nor
advance
at
the
fortunate
moment
happy
would
it
have
been
for
him
for
france
and
for
europe
if
the
science
of
astrology
once
so
much
respected
had
in
reality
afforded
the
means
of
selecting
lucky
days
few
of
his
were
marked
with
a
white
stone
sidenote
concessions
of
the
king
by
the
scheme
which
he
proposed
the
king
renounced
the
power
of
taxation
and
the
right
of
borrowing
money
except
to
a
trifling
extent
without
assent
of
the
he
invited
the
assembly
to
form
a
plan
for
regulating
de
and
acknowledged
the
personal
freedom
of
the
subject
he
provided
for
the
liberty
of
the
press
but
not
without
a
recommendation
that
some
check
should
be
placed
upon
its
license
and
he
remitted
to
the
states
as
the
proper
authority
the
abolition
of
the
and
other
unequal
or
oppressive
taxes
but
all
these
boons
availed
nothing
and
seemed
to
the
people
and
their
representatives
but
a
tardy
and
ungracious
mode
of
resigning
rights
which
the
crown
had
long
usurped
and
only
now
restored
when
they
were
on
the
point
of
being
wrested
from
its
gripe
in
addition
to
this
offence
was
taken
at
the
tone
and
terms
adopted
in
the
royal
address
the
members
of
the
assembly
conceived
that
the
expression
of
the
royal
will
was
brought
forward
in
too
imperative
a
form
they
were
offended
that
the
king
should
have
recommended
the
exclusion
of
spectators
from
the
sittings
of
the
assembly
and
much
displeasure
was
occasioned
by
his
declaring
thus
late
their
deliberations
and
decrees
on
the
subject
of
taxes
illegal
but
the
discontent
was
summed
up
and
raised
to
the
height
by
the
concluding
article
of
the
royal
address
in
which
notwithstanding
their
late
declarations
and
oath
not
to
break
up
their
sittings
until
they
had
completed
a
constitution
for
france
the
king
presumed
by
his
own
sole
authority
to
dissolve
the
estates
to
conclude
necker
upon
whom
alone
among
the
ministers
the
popular
party
reposed
confidence
had
absented
himself
from
the
royal
sitting
and
thereby
intimated
his
discontent
with
the
scheme
proposed
this
plan
of
a
constitutional
reformation
was
received
with
great
applause
by
the
clergy
and
the
nobles
while
the
third
estate
listened
in
sullen
silence
they
knew
little
of
the
human
mind
who
supposed
that
the
display
of
prerogative
which
had
been
so
often
successfully
resisted
could
influence
such
a
body
or
induce
them
to
descend
from
the
station
of
power
which
they
had
gained
and
to
render
themselves
ridiculous
by
rescinding
the
vow
which
they
had
so
lately
taken
the
king
having
by
his
own
proper
authority
dissolved
the
assembly
left
the
hall
followed
by
the
nobles
and
part
of
the
clergy
but
the
remaining
members
hitherto
silent
and
sullen
immediately
resumed
their
sitting
the
king
supposing
him
resolute
to
assert
the
prerogative
which
his
own
voice
had
but
just
claimed
had
no
alternative
but
that
of
expelling
them
by
force
and
thus
supporting
his
order
for
dissolution
of
the
assembly
but
always
halting
between
two
opinions
louis
employed
no
rougher
means
of
removing
them
than
a
gentle
summons
to
disperse
intimated
by
the
royal
master
of
ceremonies
to
this
officer
not
certainly
the
most
formidable
satellite
of
arbitrary
power
mirabeau
replied
with
energetic
determination
slave
return
to
thy
master
and
tell
him
that
his
bayonets
alone
can
drive
from
their
post
the
representatives
of
the
people
the
assembly
then
on
the
motion
of
camus
proceeded
to
pass
a
decree
that
they
adhered
to
their
oath
taken
in
the
while
by
another
they
declared
that
their
own
persons
were
inviolable
and
that
whoever
should
attempt
to
execute
any
restraint
or
violence
upon
a
representative
of
the
people
should
be
thereby
guilty
of
the
crime
of
high
treason
against
the
nation
their
firmness
joined
to
the
inviolability
with
which
they
had
invested
themselves
and
the
commotions
which
had
broken
out
at
paris
compelled
the
king
to
give
way
and
renounce
his
purpose
of
dissolving
the
states
which
continued
their
sittings
under
their
new
title
of
the
national
assembly
while
at
different
intervals
and
by
different
manœuvres
the
chambers
of
the
clergy
and
nobles
were
united
with
them
or
more
properly
were
merged
and
absorbed
in
one
general
body
had
that
assembly
been
universally
as
pure
in
its
intentions
as
we
verily
believe
to
have
been
the
case
with
many
or
most
of
its
members
the
french
government
now
lying
dead
at
their
feet
might
like
the
clay
of
prometheus
have
received
new
animation
from
their
hand
but
the
national
assembly
though
almost
unanimous
in
resisting
the
authority
of
the
crown
and
in
opposing
the
claims
of
the
privileged
classes
was
much
divided
respecting
ulterior
views
and
carried
in
its
bosom
the
seeds
of
internal
dissension
and
the
jarring
elements
of
at
least
four
parties
which
had
afterwards
their
successive
entrance
and
exit
on
the
revolutionary
stage
or
rather
one
followed
the
other
like
successive
billows
each
obliterating
and
destroying
the
marks
its
predecessor
had
left
on
the
beach
sidenote
parties
of
the
assembly
the
first
and
most
practical
division
of
these
legislators
was
the
class
headed
by
mounier
one
of
the
wisest
as
well
as
one
of
the
best
and
worthiest
men
in
france
by
malouet
and
others
they
were
patrons
of
a
scheme
at
which
we
have
already
hinted
and
they
thought
france
ought
to
look
for
some
of
the
institutions
favourable
to
freedom
to
england
whose
freedom
had
flourished
so
long
to
transplant
the
british
oak
with
all
its
contorted
branches
and
extended
roots
would
have
been
a
fruitless
attempt
but
the
infant
tree
of
liberty
might
have
been
taught
to
grow
after
the
same
fashion
modern
france
like
england
of
old
might
have
retained
such
of
her
own
ancient
laws
forms
or
regulations
as
still
were
regarded
by
the
nation
with
any
portion
of
respect
intermingling
them
with
such
additions
and
alterations
as
were
required
by
the
liberal
spirit
of
modern
times
and
the
whole
might
have
been
formed
on
the
principles
of
british
freedom
the
nation
might
thus
in
building
its
own
bulwarks
have
profited
by
the
plan
of
those
which
had
so
long
resisted
the
tempest
it
is
true
the
french
legislature
could
not
have
promised
themselves
by
the
adoption
of
this
course
to
form
at
once
a
perfect
and
entire
system
but
they
might
have
secured
the
personal
freedom
of
the
subject
the
trial
by
jury
the
liberty
of
the
press
and
the
right
of
granting
or
withholding
the
supplies
necessary
for
conducting
the
state
of
itself
the
strongest
of
all
guarantees
for
national
freedom
and
that
of
which
when
once
vested
in
their
own
representatives
the
people
will
never
permit
them
to
be
deprived
they
might
have
adopted
also
other
checks
balances
and
controls
essential
to
the
permanence
of
a
free
country
and
having
laid
so
strong
a
foundation
there
would
have
been
time
to
experience
their
use
as
well
as
their
stability
and
to
introduce
gradually
such
further
improvements
additions
or
alterations
as
the
state
of
france
should
appear
to
require
after
experience
of
those
which
they
had
adopted
but
besides
that
the
national
spirit
might
be
revolted
not
unnaturally
however
unwisely
at
borrowing
the
essential
peculiarities
of
their
new
constitution
from
a
country
which
they
were
accustomed
to
consider
as
the
natural
rival
of
their
own
there
existed
among
the
french
a
jealousy
of
the
crown
and
especially
of
the
privileged
classes
with
whom
they
had
been
so
lately
engaged
in
political
hostility
which
disinclined
the
greater
part
of
the
assembly
to
trust
the
king
with
much
authority
or
the
nobles
with
that
influence
which
any
imitation
of
the
english
constitution
must
have
assigned
to
them
a
fear
prevailed
that
whatever
privileges
should
be
left
to
the
king
or
nobles
would
be
so
many
means
of
attack
furnished
to
them
against
the
new
system
joined
to
this
was
the
ambition
of
creating
at
once
and
by
their
own
united
wisdom
a
constitution
as
perfect
as
the
armed
personification
of
wisdom
in
the
heathen
mythology
england
had
worked
her
way
from
practical
reformation
of
abuses
into
the
adoption
of
general
maxims
of
government
it
was
reserved
thought
most
of
the
national
assembly
for
france
to
adopt
a
nobler
and
more
intellectual
course
and
by
laying
down
abstract
doctrines
of
public
right
to
deduce
from
these
their
rules
of
practical
legislation
just
as
it
is
said
that
in
the
french
naval
yards
their
vessels
are
constructed
upon
the
principles
of
abstract
mathematics
while
those
in
england
are
or
were
chiefly
built
upon
the
more
technical
and
mechanical
rules
but
it
seems
on
this
and
other
occasions
to
have
escaped
these
acute
reasoners
that
beams
and
planks
are
subject
to
certain
unalterable
natural
laws
while
man
is
by
the
various
passions
acting
in
his
nature
in
contradiction
often
to
the
suggestions
of
his
understanding
as
well
as
by
the
various
modifications
of
society
liable
to
a
thousand
variations
all
of
which
call
for
limitations
and
exceptions
qualifying
whatever
general
maxims
may
be
adopted
concerning
his
duties
and
his
rights
all
such
considerations
were
spurned
by
the
numerous
body
of
the
new
french
legislature
who
resolved
in
imitation
of
medea
to
fling
into
their
renovating
kettle
every
existing
joint
and
member
of
their
old
constitution
in
order
to
its
perfect
and
entire
renovation
this
mode
of
proceeding
was
liable
to
three
great
objections
that
the
practical
inferences
deduced
from
the
abstract
principle
were
always
liable
to
challenge
by
those
who
in
logical
language
denied
the
minor
of
the
proposition
or
asserted
that
the
conclusion
was
irregularly
deduced
from
the
premises
that
the
legislators
thus
grounding
the
whole
basis
of
their
intended
constitution
upon
speculative
political
opinions
strongly
resembled
the
tailors
of
laputa
who
without
condescending
to
take
measure
of
their
customers
like
brethren
of
the
trade
elsewhere
took
the
girth
and
altitude
of
the
person
by
mathematical
calculation
and
if
the
clothes
did
not
fit
as
was
almost
always
the
case
thought
it
ample
consolation
for
the
party
concerned
to
be
assured
that
as
they
worked
from
infallible
rules
of
art
the
error
could
only
be
occasioned
by
his
own
faulty
and
irregular
conformation
of
figure
a
legislature
which
contents
itself
with
such
a
constitution
as
is
adapted
to
the
existing
state
of
things
may
hope
to
attain
their
end
and
in
presenting
it
to
the
people
may
be
entitled
to
say
that
although
the
plan
is
not
perfect
it
partakes
in
that
but
of
the
nature
of
all
earthly
institutions
while
it
comprehends
the
elements
of
as
much
good
as
the
actual
state
of
society
permits
but
from
the
lawmakers
who
begin
by
destroying
all
existing
enactments
and
assume
it
as
their
duty
entirely
to
renovate
the
constitution
of
a
country
nothing
short
of
absolute
perfection
can
be
accepted
they
can
shelter
themselves
under
no
respect
to
ancient
prejudices
which
they
have
contradicted
or
to
circumstances
of
society
which
they
have
thrown
out
of
consideration
they
must
follow
up
to
the
uttermost
the
principle
they
have
adopted
and
their
institutions
can
never
be
fixed
or
secure
from
the
encroachments
of
succeeding
innovators
while
they
retain
any
taint
of
that
fallibility
to
which
all
human
inventions
are
necessarily
subject
the
majority
of
the
french
assembly
entertained
nevertheless
the
ambitious
view
of
making
a
constitution
corresponding
in
every
respect
to
those
propositions
they
had
laid
down
as
embracing
the
rights
of
man
which
if
it
should
not
happen
to
suit
the
condition
of
their
country
would
nevertheless
be
such
as
to
have
suited
it
but
for
the
irregular
play
of
human
passions
and
the
artificial
habits
acquired
in
an
artificial
state
of
society
but
this
majority
differed
among
themselves
in
this
essential
particular
that
the
second
division
of
the
legislature
holding
that
of
mounier
for
the
first
was
disposed
to
place
at
the
head
of
their
government
the
reigning
king
louis
xvi
this
resolution
in
his
favour
might
be
partly
out
of
regard
to
the
long
partiality
of
the
nation
to
the
house
of
bourbon
partly
out
of
respect
for
the
philanthropical
and
accommodating
character
of
louis
we
may
conceive
also
that
la
fayette
bred
a
soldier
and
bailli
educated
a
magistrate
had
still
notwithstanding
their
political
creed
a
natural
though
unphilosophical
partiality
to
their
and
sovereign
and
a
conscientious
desire
to
relax
so
far
as
his
particular
interest
was
concerned
their
general
rule
of
reversing
all
that
had
previously
had
a
political
existence
in
france
sidenote
republicans
a
third
faction
entertaining
the
same
articles
of
political
creed
with
la
fayette
bailli
and
others
carried
them
much
farther
and
set
at
defiance
the
scruples
which
limited
the
two
first
parties
in
their
career
of
reformation
these
last
agreed
with
la
fayette
on
the
necessity
of
reconstructing
the
whole
government
upon
a
new
basis
without
which
entire
innovation
they
further
agreed
with
him
that
it
must
have
been
perpetually
liable
to
the
chance
of
a
but
carrying
their
arguments
farther
than
the
constitutional
party
as
the
followers
of
fayette
these
bolder
theorists
pleaded
the
inconsistency
and
danger
of
placing
at
the
head
of
their
new
system
of
reformed
and
regenerated
government
a
prince
accustomed
to
consider
himself
as
by
inheritance
the
legitimate
possessor
of
absolute
power
they
urged
that
like
the
snake
and
peasant
in
the
fable
it
was
impossible
that
the
monarch
and
his
democratical
counsellors
could
forget
the
one
the
loss
of
his
power
the
other
the
constant
temptation
which
must
beset
the
king
to
attempt
its
recovery
with
more
consistency
therefore
than
the
constitutionalists
this
third
party
of
politicians
became
decided
republicans
determined
upon
obliterating
from
the
new
constitution
every
name
and
vestige
of
monarchy
the
men
of
letters
in
the
assembly
were
many
of
them
attached
to
this
faction
they
had
originally
been
kept
in
the
background
by
the
lawyers
and
mercantile
part
of
the
assembly
many
of
them
possessed
great
talents
and
were
by
nature
men
of
honour
and
of
virtue
but
in
great
revolutions
it
is
impossible
to
resist
the
dizzying
effect
of
enthusiastic
feeling
and
excited
passion
in
the
violence
of
their
zeal
for
the
liberty
of
france
they
too
frequently
adopted
the
maxim
that
so
glorious
an
object
sanctioned
almost
any
means
which
could
be
used
to
attain
it
under
the
exaggerated
influence
of
a
mistaken
patriotism
they
were
too
apt
to
forget
that
a
crime
remains
the
same
in
character
even
when
perpetrated
in
a
public
cause
it
was
among
these
ardent
men
that
first
arose
the
idea
of
forming
a
club
or
society
to
serve
as
a
point
of
union
for
those
who
entertained
the
same
political
sentiments
once
united
they
rendered
their
sittings
public
combined
them
with
affiliated
societies
in
all
parts
of
france
and
could
thus
as
from
one
common
centre
agitate
the
most
remote
frontiers
with
the
passionate
feelings
which
electrified
the
metropolis
this
formidable
weapon
was
in
process
of
time
wrested
out
of
the
hands
of
the
federalists
as
the
original
republicans
were
invidiously
called
by
the
faction
who
were
generally
termed
jacobins
from
their
influence
in
that
society
and
whose
existence
and
peculiarities
as
a
party
we
have
now
to
notice
sidenote
jacobins
as
yet
this
fourth
and
as
it
afterwards
proved
most
formidable
party
lurked
in
secret
among
the
republicans
of
a
higher
order
and
purer
sentiments
as
they
on
their
part
had
not
yet
raised
the
mask
or
ventured
to
declare
openly
against
the
plan
of
a
constitutional
monarchy
the
jacobins
were
termed
in
ridicule
by
the
republicans
who
seeing
in
them
only
men
of
a
fiery
disposition
and
violence
of
deportment
and
declamation
vainly
thought
they
could
halloo
them
on
and
call
them
off
at
their
pleasure
they
were
yet
to
learn
that
when
force
is
solemnly
appealed
to
the
strongest
and
most
ferocious
as
they
must
be
foremost
in
the
battle
will
not
lose
their
share
of
the
spoil
and
are
more
likely
to
make
the
lion
partitions
these
jacobins
affected
to
carry
the
ideas
of
liberty
and
equality
to
the
most
extravagant
lengths
and
were
laughed
at
and
ridiculed
in
the
assembly
as
a
sort
of
fanatics
too
absurd
to
be
dreaded
their
character
indeed
was
too
exaggerated
their
habits
too
openly
profligate
their
manners
too
abominably
coarse
their
schemes
too
extravagantly
violent
to
be
produced
in
open
day
while
yet
the
decent
forms
of
society
were
observed
but
they
were
not
the
less
successful
in
gaining
the
lower
classes
whose
cause
they
pretended
peculiarly
to
espouse
whose
passions
they
inflamed
by
an
eloquence
suited
to
such
hearers
and
whose
tastes
they
flattered
by
affectation
of
brutal
manners
and
vulgar
dress
they
soon
by
these
arts
attached
to
themselves
a
large
body
of
followers
violently
inflamed
with
the
prejudices
which
had
been
infused
into
their
minds
and
too
boldly
desperate
to
hesitate
at
any
measures
which
should
be
recommended
by
their
demagogues
what
might
be
the
ultimate
object
of
these
men
can
not
be
known
we
can
hardly
give
any
of
them
credit
for
being
mad
enough
to
have
any
real
patriotic
feeling
however
extravagantly
distorted
most
probably
each
had
formed
some
vague
prospect
of
terminating
the
affair
to
his
own
advantage
but
in
the
meantime
all
agreed
in
the
necessity
of
sustaining
the
revolutionary
impulse
of
deferring
the
return
of
quiet
and
of
resisting
and
deranging
any
description
of
orderly
and
peaceful
government
they
were
sensible
that
the
return
of
law
under
any
established
and
regular
form
whatever
must
render
them
as
contemptible
as
odious
and
were
determined
to
avail
themselves
of
the
disorder
while
it
lasted
and
to
snatch
at
and
enjoy
such
portions
of
the
national
wreck
as
the
tempest
might
throw
within
their
individual
reach
this
foul
and
desperate
faction
could
not
by
all
the
activity
it
used
have
attained
the
sway
which
it
exerted
amongst
the
lees
of
the
people
without
possessing
and
exercising
extensively
the
power
of
suborning
inferior
leaders
among
the
populace
it
has
been
generally
asserted
that
means
for
attaining
this
important
object
were
supplied
by
the
immense
wealth
of
the
nearest
prince
of
the
blood
royal
that
duke
of
orleans
whose
name
is
so
unhappily
mixed
with
the
history
of
this
period
by
his
largesses
according
to
the
general
report
of
historians
a
number
of
the
most
violent
writers
of
pamphlets
and
newspapers
were
pensioned
who
deluged
the
public
with
false
news
and
violent
abuse
this
prince
it
is
said
recompensed
those
popular
and
ferocious
orators
who
nightly
harangued
the
people
in
the
palais
royal
and
openly
stimulated
them
to
the
most
violent
aggressions
upon
the
persons
and
property
of
obnoxious
individuals
from
the
same
unhappy
coffers
were
paid
numbers
of
those
who
regularly
attended
on
the
debates
of
the
assembly
crowded
the
galleries
to
the
exclusion
of
the
public
at
large
applauded
hissed
exercised
an
almost
domineering
influence
in
the
national
councils
and
were
sometimes
addressed
by
the
representatives
of
the
people
as
if
they
had
themselves
been
the
people
of
whom
they
were
the
scum
and
the
refuse
fouler
accusations
even
than
these
charges
were
brought
forward
bands
of
strangers
men
of
wild
haggard
and
ferocious
appearance
whose
persons
the
still
watchful
police
of
paris
were
unacquainted
with
began
to
be
seen
in
the
metropolis
like
those
obscene
and
birds
which
are
seldom
visible
except
before
a
storm
all
these
were
understood
to
be
suborned
by
the
duke
of
orleans
and
his
agents
to
unite
with
the
ignorant
violent
corrupted
populace
of
the
great
metropolis
of
france
for
the
purpose
of
urging
and
guiding
them
to
actions
of
terror
and
cruelty
the
ultimate
object
of
these
manœuvres
is
supposed
to
have
been
a
change
of
dynasty
which
should
gratify
the
duke
of
orleans
revenge
by
the
deposition
of
his
cousin
and
his
ambition
by
enthroning
himself
in
his
stead
or
at
least
by
nominating
him
lieutenant
of
france
with
all
the
royal
powers
the
most
daring
and
unscrupulous
amongst
the
jacobins
are
said
originally
to
have
belonged
to
the
faction
of
orleans
but
as
he
manifested
a
want
of
decision
and
did
not
avail
himself
of
opportunities
of
pushing
his
fortune
they
abandoned
their
leader
whom
they
continued
however
to
flatter
and
deceive
and
at
the
head
of
the
partisans
collected
for
his
service
and
paid
from
his
finances
they
pursued
the
path
of
their
individual
fortunes
besides
the
various
parties
which
we
have
detailed
and
which
gradually
developed
their
discordant
sentiments
as
the
revolution
proceeded
the
assembly
contained
the
usual
proportion
of
that
prudent
class
of
politicians
who
are
guided
by
events
and
who
in
the
days
of
cromwell
called
themselves
waiters
upon
providence
men
who
might
boast
with
the
miller
in
the
tale
that
though
they
could
not
direct
the
course
of
the
wind
they
could
adjust
their
sails
so
as
to
profit
by
it
blow
from
what
quarter
it
would
all
the
various
parties
in
the
assembly
by
whose
division
the
king
might
by
temporizing
measures
have
surely
profited
were
united
in
a
determined
course
of
hostility
to
the
crown
and
its
pretensions
by
the
course
which
louis
xvi
was
unfortunately
advised
to
pursue
it
had
been
resolved
to
assume
a
menacing
attitude
and
to
place
the
king
at
the
head
of
a
strong
force
orders
were
given
accordingly
sidenote
treachery
of
the
army
necker
though
approving
of
many
parts
of
the
proposal
made
to
the
assembly
at
the
royal
sitting
had
strongly
dissented
from
others
and
had
opposed
the
measure
of
marching
troops
towards
versailles
and
paris
to
overawe
the
capital
and
if
necessary
the
national
assembly
necker
received
his
dismission
and
thus
a
second
time
the
king
and
the
people
seemed
to
be
prepared
for
open
war
the
force
at
first
glance
seemed
entirely
on
the
royal
side
thirty
regiments
were
drawn
around
paris
and
versailles
commanded
by
marshal
broglio
an
officer
of
eminence
and
believed
to
be
a
zealous
and
a
large
camp
formed
under
the
walls
of
the
metropolis
the
town
was
opened
on
all
sides
and
the
only
persons
by
whom
defence
could
be
offered
were
an
unarmed
mob
but
this
superiority
existed
only
in
appearance
the
french
guards
had
already
united
themselves
or
as
the
phrase
then
went
with
the
people
yielding
to
the
various
modes
employed
to
dispose
them
to
the
popular
cause
and
little
attached
to
their
officers
most
of
whom
only
saw
their
companies
upon
the
days
of
parade
or
duty
an
apparent
accident
which
probably
had
its
origin
in
an
experiment
upon
the
feelings
of
these
regiments
brought
the
matter
to
a
crisis
the
soldiers
had
been
supplied
secretly
with
means
of
unusual
dissipation
and
consequently
a
laxity
of
discipline
was
daily
gaining
ground
among
them
to
correct
this
license
eleven
of
the
guards
had
been
committed
to
prison
for
military
offences
the
parisian
mob
delivered
them
by
violence
and
took
them
under
the
protection
of
the
inhabitants
a
conduct
which
made
the
natural
impression
on
their
comrades
their
numbers
were
three
thousand
six
hundred
of
the
best
soldiers
in
france
accustomed
to
military
discipline
occupying
every
strong
point
in
the
city
and
supported
by
its
immense
though
disorderly
populace
the
gaining
these
regiments
gave
the
revolutionists
the
command
of
paris
from
which
the
army
assembled
under
broglio
might
have
found
it
hard
to
dislodge
them
but
these
last
were
more
willing
to
aid
than
to
quell
any
insurrection
which
might
take
place
the
modes
of
seduction
which
had
succeeded
with
the
french
guards
were
sedulously
addressed
to
other
corps
the
regiments
which
lay
nearest
to
paris
were
not
forgotten
they
were
plied
with
those
temptations
which
are
most
powerful
with
soldiers
wine
women
and
money
were
supplied
in
abundance
and
it
was
amidst
debauchery
and
undiscipline
that
the
french
army
renounced
their
loyalty
which
used
to
be
even
too
much
the
god
of
their
idolatry
and
which
was
now
destroyed
like
the
temple
of
persepolis
amidst
the
vapours
of
wine
and
at
the
instigation
of
courtezans
there
remained
the
foreign
troops
of
which
there
were
several
regiments
but
their
disposition
was
doubtful
and
to
use
them
against
the
citizens
of
paris
might
have
been
to
confirm
the
soldiers
of
the
soil
in
their
indisposition
to
the
royal
cause
supported
as
it
must
then
have
been
by
foreigners
exclusively
meanwhile
the
dark
intrigues
which
had
been
long
formed
for
accomplishing
a
general
insurrection
in
paris
were
now
ready
to
be
brought
into
action
the
populace
had
been
encouraged
by
success
in
one
or
two
skirmishes
with
the
and
foreign
soldiery
they
had
stood
a
skirmish
with
a
regiment
of
german
horse
and
had
been
successful
the
number
of
desperate
characters
who
were
to
lead
the
van
in
these
violences
was
now
greatly
increased
deep
had
called
to
deep
and
the
revolutionary
clubs
of
paris
had
summoned
their
confederates
from
among
the
most
fiery
and
forward
of
every
province
besides
troops
of
and
deserters
vagabonds
of
every
order
flocked
to
paris
like
ravens
to
the
spoil
to
these
were
joined
the
lowest
inhabitants
of
a
populous
city
always
ready
for
riot
and
rapine
and
they
were
led
on
and
encouraged
by
men
who
were
in
many
instances
sincere
enthusiasts
in
the
cause
of
liberty
and
thought
it
could
only
be
victorious
by
the
destruction
of
the
present
government
the
republican
and
jacobin
party
were
open
in
sentiment
and
in
action
encouraging
the
insurrection
by
every
means
in
their
power
the
constitutionalists
more
passive
were
still
rejoiced
to
see
the
storm
arise
conceiving
such
a
crisis
was
necessary
to
compel
the
king
to
place
the
helm
of
the
state
in
their
hands
it
might
have
been
expected
that
the
assembled
force
of
the
crown
would
be
employed
to
preserve
the
peace
at
least
and
prevent
the
general
system
of
robbery
and
plunder
which
seemed
about
to
ensue
they
appeared
not
and
the
citizens
themselves
took
arms
by
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
forming
the
burgher
militia
which
was
afterwards
called
the
national
guard
the
royal
arsenals
were
plundered
to
obtain
arms
and
la
fayette
was
adopted
the
of
this
new
army
a
sufficient
sign
that
they
were
to
embrace
what
was
called
the
constitutional
party
another
large
proportion
of
the
population
was
hastily
armed
with
pikes
a
weapon
which
was
thence
termed

the
baron
de
besenval
at
the
head
of
the
swiss
guards
two
foreign
regiments
and
eight
hundred

after
an
idle
demonstration
which
only
served
to
encourage
the
insurgents
retired
from
paris
without
firing
a
shot
having
he
says
in
his
memoirs
no
orders
how
to
act
and
being
desirous
to
avoid
precipitating
a
civil
war
his
retreat
was
the
signal
for
a
general
insurrection
in
which
the
french
guard
the
national
guard
and
the
armed
mob
of
paris
took
the
bastile
and
massacred
a
part
of
the
garrison
july
we
are
not
tracing
minutely
the
events
of
the
revolution
but
only
attempting
to
describe
their
spirit
and
tendency
and
we
may
here
notice
two
changes
which
for
the
first
time
were
observed
to
have
taken
place
in
the
character
of
the
parisian
populace
the
de
as
they
were
called
in
derision
had
been
hitherto
viewed
as
a
light
laughing
thoughtless
race
passionately
fond
of
news
though
not
very
acutely
distinguishing
betwixt
truth
and
falsehood
quick
in
adopting
impressions
but
incapable
of
forming
firm
and
concerted
resolutions
still
more
incapable
of
executing
them
and
so
easily
overawed
by
an
armed
force
that
about
twelve
hundred
police
soldiers
had
been
hitherto
sufficient
to
keep
all
paris
in
subjection
but
in
the
attack
of
the
bastile
they
showed
themselves
resolute
and
unyielding
as
well
as
prompt
and
headlong
these
new
qualities
were
in
some
degree
owing
to
the
support
which
they
received
from
the
french
guards
but
are
still
more
to
be
attributed
to
the
loftier
and
more
decided
character
belonging
to
the
revolutionary
spirit
and
the
mixture
of
men
of
the
better
classes
and
of
the
high
tone
which
belongs
to
them
among
the
mere
rabble
of
the
city
the
garrison
of
this
castle
was
indeed
very
weak
but
its
deep
moats
and
insurmountable
bulwarks
presented
the
most
imposing
show
of
resistance
and
the
triumph
which
the
popular
cause
obtained
in
an
exploit
seemingly
so
desperate
infused
a
general
consternation
into
the
king
and
the
royalists
sidenote
murder
of
foulon
and
berthier
the
second
remarkable
particular
was
that
from
being
one
of
the
most
and
of
nations
the
french
seemed
upon
the
revolution
to
have
been
animated
not
merely
with
the
courage
but
with
the
rabid
fury
of
unchained
foulon
and
berthier
two
individuals
whom
they
considered
as
enemies
of
the
people
were
put
to
death
with
circumstances
of
cruelty
and
insult
fitting
only
at
the
of
a
cherokee
encampment
and
in
emulation
of
literal
cannibals
there
were
men
or
rather
monsters
found
not
only
to
tear
asunder
the
limbs
of
their
victims
but
to
eat
their
hearts
and
drink
their
blood
the
intensity
of
the
new
doctrines
of
freedom
the
animosity
occasioned
by
civil
commotion
can
not
account
for
these
atrocities
even
in
the
lowest
and
most
ignorant
of
the
populace
those
who
led
the
way
in
such
enormities
must
have
been
practised
murderers
and
assassins
mixed
with
the
insurgents
like
old
hounds
in
a
young
pack
to
lead
them
on
flesh
them
with
slaughter
and
teach
an
example
of
cruelty
too
easily
learned
but
hard
to
be
ever
forgotten
the
metropolis
was
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
insurgents
and
civil
war
or
submission
was
the
only
resource
left
to
the
sovereign
for
the
former
course
sufficient
reasons
might
be
urged
the
whole
proceedings
in
the
metropolis
had
been
entirely
insurrectionary
without
the
least
pretence
of
authority
from
the
national
assembly
which
continued
sitting
at
versailles
discussing
the
order
of
the
day
while
the
citizens
of
paris
were
storming
castles
and
tearing
to
pieces
their
prisoners
without
authority
from
the
national
representatives
and
even
without
the
consent
of
their
own
civic
rulers
the
provost
of
the
merchants
was
assassinated
at
the
commencement
of
the
disturbance
and
a
terrified
committee
of
electors
were
the
only
persons
who
preserved
the
least
semblance
of
authority
which
they
were
obliged
to
exercise
under
the
control
and
at
the
pleasure
of
the
infuriated
multitude
a
large
proportion
of
the
citizens
though
assuming
arms
for
the
protection
of
themselves
and
their
families
had
no
desire
of
employing
them
against
the
royal
authority
a
much
larger
only
united
themselves
with
the
insurgents
because
in
a
moment
of
universal
agitation
they
were
the
active
and
predominant
party
of
these
the
former
desired
peace
and
protection
the
latter
from
habit
and
shame
must
have
soon
deserted
the
side
which
was
ostensibly
conducted
by
ruffians
and
common
stabbers
and
drawn
themselves
to
that
which
protected
peace
and
good
order
we
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
a
people
so
enlightened
as
those
of
france
too
good
an
opinion
of
human
nature
in
any
country
to
believe
that
men
will
persist
in
evil
if
defended
in
their
honest
and
legal
rights
sidenote
conduct
of
the
king
what
in
this
case
was
the
duty
of
louis
we
answer
without
hesitation
that
which
george
iii
of
britain
proposed
to
himself
when
in
the
name
of
the
protestant
religion
a
violent
and
disorderly
mob
opened
prisons
destroyed
property
burned
houses
and
committed
though
with
far
fewer
symptoms
of
atrocity
the
same
course
of
disorder
which
now
laid
waste
paris
it
is
known
that
when
his
ministers
hesitated
to
give
an
opinion
in
point
of
law
concerning
the
employment
of
military
force
for
protection
of
life
and
property
against
a
disorderly
banditti
the
king
as
chief
magistrate
declared
his
own
purpose
to
march
into
the
blazing
city
at
the
head
of
his
guards
and
with
the
strong
hand
of
war
to
subdue
the
insurgents
and
restore
peace
to
the
affrighted
capital
the
same
call
now
sounded
loudly
in
the
ear
of
louis
he
was
still
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
people
whose
duty
it
was
to
protect
their
lives
and
property
still
commander
of
that
army
levied
and
paid
for
protecting
the
law
of
the
country
and
the
lives
and
property
of
the
subject
the
king
ought
to
have
proceeded
to
the
national
assembly
without
an
instant
delay
cleared
himself
before
that
body
of
the
suspicions
with
which
calumny
had
loaded
him
and
required
and
commanded
the
assistance
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
to
quell
the
frightful
excesses
of
murder
and
rapine
which
dishonoured
the
capital
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
whole
moderate
party
as
they
were
called
would
have
united
with
the
nobles
and
the
clergy
the
throne
was
not
yet
empty
nor
the
sword
unswayed
louis
had
surrendered
much
and
might
in
the
course
of
the
change
impending
have
been
obliged
to
surrender
more
but
he
was
still
king
of
france
still
bound
by
his
coronation
oath
to
prevent
murder
and
put
down
insurrection
he
could
not
be
considered
as
crushing
the
cause
of
freedom
in
answering
a
call
to
discharge
his
kingly
duty
for
what
had
the
cause
of
reformation
proceeding
as
it
was
by
the
peaceful
discussion
of
an
unarmed
convention
to
do
with
the
open
war
waged
by
the
insurgents
of
paris
upon
the
king
troops
or
with
the
gratuitous
murders
and
atrocities
with
which
the
capital
had
been
polluted
with
such
members
as
shame
and
fear
might
have
brought
over
from
the
opposite
side
the
king
exerting
himself
as
a
prince
would
have
formed
a
majority
strong
enough
to
show
the
union
which
subsisted
betwixt
the
crown
and
the
assembly
when
the
protection
of
the
laws
was
the
point
in
question
with
such
a
support
or
without
it
for
it
is
the
duty
of
the
prince
in
a
crisis
of
such
emergency
to
serve
the
people
and
save
the
country
by
the
exercise
of
his
royal
prerogative
whether
with
or
without
the
concurrence
of
the
other
branches
of
the
legislature
the
king
at
the
head
of
his
du
of
the
regiments
which
might
have
been
found
faithful
of
the
nobles
and
gentry
whose
principles
of
chivalry
devoted
them
to
the
service
of
their
sovereign
ought
to
have
marched
into
paris
and
put
down
the
insurrection
by
the
armed
hand
of
authority
or
fallen
in
the
attempt
like
the
representative
of
henry
iv
his
duty
called
upon
him
and
the
authority
with
which
he
was
invested
enabled
him
to
act
this
part
which
in
all
probability
would
have
dismayed
the
factious
encouraged
the
timid
decided
the
wavering
and
by
obtaining
a
conquest
over
lawless
and
brute
violence
would
have
paved
the
way
for
a
moderate
and
secure
reformation
in
the
state
but
having
obtained
this
victory
in
the
name
of
the
law
of
the
realm
the
king
could
only
be
vindicated
in
having
resorted
to
arms
by
using
his
conquest
with
such
moderation
as
to
show
that
he
threw
his
sword
into
the
one
scale
solely
in
order
to
balance
the
clubs
and
poniards
of
popular
insurrection
with
which
the
other
was
loaded
he
must
then
have
evinced
that
he
did
not
mean
to
obstruct
the
quiet
course
of
moderation
and
constitutional
reform
in
stemming
that
of
headlong
and
violent
innovation
many
disputes
would
have
remained
to
be
settled
between
him
and
his
subjects
but
the
process
of
improving
the
constitution
though
less
rapid
would
have
been
more
safe
and
certain
and
the
kingdom
of
france
might
have
attained
a
degree
of
freedom
equal
to
that
which
she
now
possesses
without
passing
through
a
brief
but
dreadful
anarchy
to
long
years
of
military
despotism
without
the
loss
of
mines
of
treasure
and
without
the
expenditure
of
oceans
of
blood
to
those
who
object
the
peril
of
this
course
and
the
risk
to
the
person
of
the
sovereign
from
the
fury
of
the
insurgents
we
can
only
answer
in
the
words
of
the
elder
horatius
prince
or
peasant
have
alike
lived
long
enough
when
the
choice
comes
to
be
betwixt
loss
of
life
and
an
important
duty
undischarged
death
at
the
head
of
his
troops
would
have
saved
louis
more
cruel
humiliation
his
subjects
a
deeper
crime
we
do
not
affect
to
deny
that
in
this
course
there
was
considerable
risk
of
another
kind
and
that
it
is
very
possible
that
the
king
susceptible
as
he
was
to
the
influence
of
those
around
him
might
have
lain
under
strong
temptation
to
have
resumed
the
despotic
authority
of
which
he
had
in
a
great
measure
divested
himself
and
have
thus
abused
a
victory
gained
over
insurrection
into
a
weapon
of
tyranny
but
the
spirit
of
liberty
was
so
strong
in
france
the
principles
of
leniency
and
moderation
so
natural
to
the
king
his
own
late
hazards
so
great
and
the
future
considering
the
general
disposition
of
his
subjects
so
doubtful
that
we
are
inclined
to
think
a
victory
by
the
sovereign
at
that
moment
would
have
been
followed
by
temperate
measures
how
the
people
used
theirs
is
but
too
well
known
at
any
rate
we
have
strongly
stated
our
opinion
that
louis
would
at
this
crisis
have
been
justified
in
employing
force
to
compel
order
but
that
the
crime
would
have
been
deep
and
inexpiable
had
he
abused
a
victory
to
restore
despotism
it
may
be
said
indeed
that
the
preceding
statement
takes
too
much
for
granted
and
that
the
violence
employed
on
the
july
was
probably
only
an
anticipation
of
the
forcible
measures
which
might
have
been
expected
from
the
king
against
the
assembly
the
answer
to
this
is
that
the
successful
party
may
always
cast
on
the
loser
the
blame
of
commencing
the
brawl
as
the
wolf
punished
the
lamb
for
troubling
the
course
of
the
water
though
he
drank
lowest
down
the
stream
but
when
we
find
one
party
completely
prepared
and
ready
for
action
forming
plans
boldly
and
executing
them
skilfully
and
observe
the
other
uncertain
and
unprovided
betraying
all
the
imbecility
of
surprise
and
indecision
we
must
necessarily
believe
the
attack
was
premeditated
on
the
one
side
and
unexpected
on
the
other
the
abandonment
of
thirty
thousand
stand
of
arms
at
the
hôtel
des
invalides
which
were
surrendered
without
the
slightest
resistance
though
three
swiss
regiments
lay
encamped
in
the
champs
elysées
the
totally
unprovided
state
of
the
bastile
garrisoned
by
about
one
hundred
swiss
and
invalids
and
without
provisions
even
for
that
small
number
the
absolute
inaction
of
the
baron
de
besenval
who
without
entangling
his
troops
in
the
narrow
streets
which
was
pleaded
as
his
excuse
might
by
marching
along
the
boulevards
a
passage
so
well
calculated
for
the
manœuvres
of
regular
troops
have
relieved
the
siege
of
that
fortress
and
finally
that
general
bloodless
retreat
from
paris
show
that
the
king
had
under
all
these
circumstances
not
only
adopted
no
measures
of
a
hostile
character
but
must
on
the
contrary
have
issued
such
orders
as
prevented
his
officer
from
repelling
force
by
force
we
are
led
therefore
to
believe
that
the
scheme
of
assembling
the
troops
round
paris
was
one
of
those
half
measures
to
which
with
great
political
weakness
louis
resorted
more
than
once
an
attempt
to
intimidate
by
the
demonstration
of
force
which
he
was
previously
resolved
not
to
use
had
his
purposes
of
aggression
been
serious
five
thousand
troops
of
loyal
principles
and
such
might
surely
have
been
selected
would
acting
suddenly
and
energetically
have
better
assured
him
of
the
city
of
paris
than
six
times
that
number
brought
to
waste
themselves
in
debauch
around
its
walls
and
to
be
withdrawn
without
the
discharge
of
a
musket
indeed
the
courage
of
louis
was
of
a
passive
not
an
active
nature
conspicuous
in
enduring
adversity
but
not
of
that
energetic
and
decisive
character
which
turns
dubious
affairs
into
prosperity
and
achieves
by
its
own
exertions
the
success
which
fortune
denies
the
insurrection
of
paris
being
acquiesced
in
by
the
sovereign
was
recognised
by
the
nation
as
a
legitimate
conquest
instead
of
a
state
crime
and
the
tameness
of
the
king
in
enduring
its
violence
was
assumed
as
a
proof
that
the
citizens
had
but
anticipated
his
intended
forcible
measures
against
the
assembly
and
prevented
the
military
occupation
of
the
city
in
the
debates
of
the
assembly
itself
the
insurrection
was
vindicated
the
fears
and
suspicions
alleged
as
its
motives
were
justified
as
the
passions
of
the
citizens
were
sympathized
with
and
their
worst
excesses
palliated
and
excused
when
the
horrors
accompanying
the
murder
of
berthier
and
foulon
were
dilated
upon
by
lally
tolendal
in
the
assembly
he
was
heard
and
answered
as
if
he
had
made
mountains
of
mirabeau
said
that
it
was
a
time
to
think
and
not
to
feel
barnave
asked
with
a
sneer
if
the
blood
which
had
been
shed
was
so
pure
robespierre
rising
into
animation
with
acts
of
cruelty
fitted
to
call
forth
the
interest
of
such
a
mind
observed
that
the
people
oppressed
for
ages
had
a
right
to
the
revenge
of
a
day
but
how
long
did
that
day
last
or
what
was
the
fate
of
those
who
justified
its
enormities
from
that
hour
the
mob
of
paris
or
rather
the
suborned
agitators
by
whom
the
actions
of
that
blind
multitude
were
dictated
became
masters
of
the
destiny
of
france
an
insurrection
was
organized
whenever
there
was
any
purpose
to
be
carried
and
the
assembly
might
be
said
to
work
under
the
impulse
of
the
popular
current
as
mechanically
as
the
wheel
of
a
water
engine
is
driven
by
a
cascade
the
victory
of
the
bastile
was
extended
in
its
consequences
to
the
cabinet
and
to
the
legislative
body
in
the
former
those
ministers
who
had
counselled
the
king
to
stand
on
the
defensive
against
the
assembly
or
rather
to
assume
a
threatening
attitude
suddenly
lost
courage
when
they
heard
the
fate
of
foulon
and
berthier
the
baron
de
breteueil
the
unpopular
successor
of
necker
was
deprived
of
his
office
and
driven
into
exile
and
to
complete
the
triumph
of
the
people
necker
himself
was
recalled
by
their
unanimous
voice
the
king
came
or
was
conducted
to
the
hôtel
de
ville
of
paris
in
what
compared
to
the
triumph
of
the
minister
was
a
sort
of
ovation
in
which
he
appeared
rather
as
a
captive
than
otherwise
he
entered
into
the
edifice
under
a
vault
of
steel
formed
by
the
crossed
sabres
and
pikes
of
those
who
had
been
lately
engaged
in
combating
his
soldiers
and
murdering
his
subjects
he
adopted
the
cockade
of
the
insurrection
and
in
doing
so
ratified
and
approved
of
the
acts
done
expressly
against
his
command
acquiesced
in
the
victory
obtained
over
his
own
authority
and
completed
that
conquest
by
laying
down
his
arms
the
conquest
of
the
bastile
was
the
first
almost
the
only
appeal
to
arms
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
revolution
and
the
popular
success
afterwards
sanctioned
by
the
monarch
showed
that
nothing
remained
save
the
name
of
the
ancient
government
the
king
younger
brother
the
comte
now
reigning
king
of
france
had
been
distinguished
as
the
leader
and
rallying
point
of
the
royalists
he
left
the
kingdom
with
his
children
and
took
refuge
in
turin
other
distinguished
princes
and
many
of
the
inferior
nobility
adopted
the
same
course
and
their
departure
seemed
to
announce
to
the
public
that
the
royal
cause
was
indeed
desperate
since
it
was
deserted
by
those
most
interested
in
its
defence
this
was
the
first
act
of
general
emigration
and
although
in
the
circumstances
it
may
be
excused
yet
it
must
still
be
termed
a
great
political
error
for
though
on
the
one
hand
it
is
to
be
considered
that
these
princes
and
their
followers
had
been
educated
in
the
belief
that
the
government
of
france
rested
in
the
king
person
and
was
identified
with
him
and
that
when
the
king
was
displaced
from
his
permanent
situation
of
power
the
whole
social
system
of
france
was
totally
ruined
and
nothing
remained
which
could
legally
govern
or
be
governed
yet
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
instant
the
emigrants
crossed
the
frontier
they
at
once
lost
all
the
natural
advantages
of
birth
and
education
and
separated
themselves
from
the
country
which
it
was
their
duty
to
defend
to
draw
to
a
head
and
raise
an
insurrection
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
a
counter
revolution
would
have
been
the
ready
and
natural
resource
but
the
influence
of
the
privileged
classes
was
so
totally
destroyed
that
the
scheme
seems
to
have
been
considered
as
hopeless
even
if
the
king
consent
could
have
been
obtained
to
remain
in
france
whether
in
paris
or
the
departments
must
have
exposed
them
in
their
avowed
character
of
aristocrats
to
absolute
assassination
it
has
been
therefore
urged
that
emigration
was
their
only
resource
but
there
remained
for
these
princes
nobles
and
cavaliers
a
more
noble
task
could
they
but
have
united
themselves
cordially
to
that
portion
of
the
assembly
originally
a
strong
one
which
professed
without
destroying
the
existing
state
of
monarchy
in
france
to
wish
to
infuse
into
it
the
spirit
of
rational
liberty
and
to
place
louis
in
such
a
situation
as
should
have
ensured
him
the
safe
and
honourable
station
of
a
limited
monarch
though
it
deprived
him
of
the
powers
of
a
despot
it
is
in
politics
however
as
in
religion
the
slighter
in
itself
the
difference
between
two
parties
the
more
tenacious
is
each
of
the
propositions
in
which
they
disagree
the
pure
royalists
were
so
far
from
being
disposed
to
coalesce
with
those
who
blended
an
attachment
to
monarchy
with
a
love
of
liberty
that
they
scarce
accounted
them
fit
to
share
the
dangers
and
distresses
to
which
all
were
alike
reduced
sidenote
emigration
this
first
emigration
proceeded
not
a
little
perhaps
on
the
feeling
of
among
those
by
whom
it
was
adopted
the
nobles
of
which
it
was
chiefly
composed
had
been
long
the
world
as
it
is
termed
to
paris
and
to
each
other
and
it
was
a
natural
conclusion
that
their
withdrawing
themselves
from
the
sphere
which
they
adorned
must
have
been
felt
as
an
irremediable
deprivation
they
were
not
aware
how
easily
in
the
hour
of
need
perfumed
lamps
are
to
all
purposes
of
utility
replaced
by
ordinary
candles
and
that
carrying
away
with
them
much
of
dignity
gallantry
and
grace
they
left
behind
an
ample
stock
of
wisdom
and
valour
and
all
the
other
essential
qualities
by
which
nations
are
governed
and
defended
the
situation
and
negotiations
of
the
emigrants
in
the
courts
to
which
they
fled
were
also
prejudicial
to
their
own
reputation
and
consequently
to
the
royal
cause
to
which
they
had
sacrificed
their
country
reduced
to
show
their
misery
in
foreign
lands
they
were
naturally
desirous
of
obtaining
foreign
aid
to
return
to
their
own
and
laid
themselves
under
the
heavy
accusation
of
instigating
a
civil
war
while
louis
was
yet
the
resigned
if
not
the
contented
sovereign
of
the
newly
modified
empire
to
this
subject
we
must
afterwards
return
the
conviction
that
the
ancient
monarchy
of
france
had
fallen
for
ever
gave
encouragement
to
the
numerous
parties
which
united
in
desiring
a
new
constitution
although
they
differed
on
the
principles
on
which
it
was
to
be
founded
but
all
agreed
that
it
was
necessary
in
the
first
place
to
clear
away
the
remains
of
the
ancient
state
of
things
they
resolved
upon
the
abolition
of
all
feudal
rights
and
managed
the
matter
with
so
much
address
that
it
was
made
to
appear
on
the
part
of
those
who
held
them
a
voluntary
surrender
the
debate
in
the
national
assembly
august
was
turned
by
the
popular
leaders
upon
the
odious
character
of
the
feudal
rights
and
privileges
as
being
the
chief
cause
of
the
general
depression
and
discontent
in
which
the
kingdom
was
involved
the
nobles
understood
the
hint
which
was
thus
given
them
and
answered
it
with
the
ready
courage
and
generosity
which
has
been
at
all
times
the
attribute
of
their
order
though
sometimes
these
noble
qualities
have
been
indiscreetly
exercised
is
it
from
us
personally
that
the
nation
expects
sacrifices
said
the
marquis
de
focault
be
assured
that
you
shall
not
appeal
in
vain
to
our
generosity
we
are
desirous
to
defend
to
the
last
the
rights
of
the
monarchy
but
we
can
be
lavish
of
our
peculiar
and
personal
interests
sidenote
the
day
of
dupes
the
same
general
sentiment
pervaded
at
once
the
clergy
and
nobles
who
sufficiently
sensible
that
what
they
resigned
could
not
operate
essentially
to
the
quiet
of
the
state
were
yet
too
proud
to
have
even
the
appearance
of
placing
their
own
selfish
interests
in
competition
with
the
public
welfare
the
whole
privileged
classes
seemed
at
once
seized
with
a
spirit
of
the
most
lavish
generosity
and
hastened
to
despoil
themselves
of
all
their
peculiar
immunities
and
feudal
rights
clergy
and
laymen
vied
with
each
other
in
the
nature
and
extent
of
their
sacrifices
privileges
whether
prejudicial
or
harmless
rational
or
ridiculous
were
renounced
in
the
mass
a
sort
of
delirium
pervaded
the
assembly
each
member
strove
to
distinguish
the
sacrifice
of
his
personal
claims
by
something
more
remarkable
than
had
yet
attended
any
of
the
previous
renunciations
they
who
had
no
rights
of
their
own
to
resign
had
the
easier
and
more
pleasant
task
of
surrendering
those
of
their
constituents
the
privileges
of
corporations
the
monopolies
of
crafts
the
rights
of
cities
were
heaped
on
the
national
altar
and
the
members
of
the
national
assembly
seemed
to
look
about
in
ecstasy
to
consider
of
what
else
they
could
despoil
themselves
and
others
as
if
like
the
silly
old
earl
in
the
civil
dissensions
of
england
there
had
been
an
actual
pleasure
in
the
act
of
renouncing
the
feudal
rights
were
in
many
instances
odious
in
others
oppressive
and
in
others
ridiculous
but
it
was
ominous
to
see
the
institutions
of
ages
overthrown
at
random
by
a
set
of
men
talking
and
raving
all
at
once
so
as
to
verify
the
observation
of
the
englishman
williams
one
of
their
own
members
the
fools
they
would
be
thought
to
deliberate
when
they
can
not
even
listen
the
singular
occasion
on
which
enthusiasm
false
shame
and
mutual
emulation
thus
induced
the
nobles
and
clergy
to
despoil
themselves
of
all
their
seigneurial
rights
was
called
by
some
the
of
the
by
others
more
truly
the
of
the
during
the
currency
of
this
legislative
frenzy
as
it
might
be
termed
the
popular
party
with
countenances
affecting
humility
and
shame
at
having
nothing
themselves
to
surrender
sat
praising
each
new
sacrifice
as
the
wily
companions
of
a
thoughtless
and
generous
young
man
applaud
the
lavish
expense
by
which
they
themselves
profit
while
their
seeming
admiration
is
an
incentive
to
new
acts
of
extravagance
at
length
when
the
sacrifice
seemed
complete
they
began
to
pause
and
look
around
them
some
one
thought
of
the
separate
distinctions
of
the
provinces
of
france
as
normandy
languedoc
and
so
forth
most
of
these
provinces
possessed
rights
and
privileges
acquired
by
victory
or
treaty
which
even
richelieu
had
not
dared
to
violate
as
soon
as
mentioned
they
were
at
once
thrown
into
the
revolutionary
to
be
after
the
universal
equality
which
was
the
fashion
of
the
day
it
was
not
urged
and
would
not
have
been
listened
to
that
these
rights
had
been
bought
with
blood
and
sanctioned
by
public
faith
that
the
legislature
though
it
had
a
right
to
extend
them
to
others
could
not
take
them
from
the
possessors
without
compensation
and
it
escaped
the
assembly
no
less
how
many
honest
and
generous
sentiments
are
connected
with
such
provincial
distinctions
which
form
as
it
were
a
second
and
inner
fence
around
the
love
of
a
common
country
or
how
much
harmless
enjoyment
the
poor
man
derives
from
the
consciousness
that
he
shares
the
privileges
of
some
peculiar
district
such
considerations
might
have
induced
the
legislature
to
pause
at
least
after
they
had
removed
such
marks
of
distinction
as
tended
to
engender
jealousy
betwixt
inhabitants
of
the
same
kingdom
but
her
revolutionary
level
was
to
be
passed
over
all
that
tended
to
distinguish
one
district
or
one
individual
from
another
there
was
one
order
in
the
kingdom
which
although
it
had
joined
largely
and
readily
in
the
sacrifices
of
the
of
was
still
considered
as
indebted
to
the
state
and
was
doomed
to
undergo
an
act
of
total
spoliation
the
clergy
had
agreed
and
the
assembly
had
decreed
on
august
that
the
tithes
should
be
declared
redeemable
at
a
moderate
price
by
the
proprietors
subject
to
pay
them
this
regulation
ratified
at
least
the
legality
of
the
clergy
title
nevertheless
in
violation
of
the
public
faith
thus
pledged
the
assembly
three
days
afterwards
pretended
that
the
surrender
of
tithes
had
been
absolute
and
that
in
lieu
of
that
supposed
revenue
the
nation
was
only
bound
to
provide
decently
for
the
administration
of
divine
worship
even
the
abbé
siêyes
on
this
occasion
deserted
the
revolutionary
party
and
made
an
admirable
speech
against
this
iniquitous
measure
you
would
be
free
he
exclaimed
with
vehemence
and
you
know
not
how
to
be
just
a
curate
in
the
assembly
recalling
to
mind
the
solemn
invocation
by
which
the
tiers
etat
had
called
upon
the
clergy
to
unite
with
them
asked
with
similar
energy
was
it
to
rob
us
that
you
invited
us
to
join
with
you
in
the
name
of
the
god
of
peace
mirabeau
on
the
other
hand
forgot
the
vehemence
with
which
he
had
pleaded
the
right
of
property
inherent
in
religious
bodies
and
lent
his
sophistry
to
defend
what
his
own
reasoning
had
proved
in
a
similar
case
to
be
indefensible
the
complaints
of
the
clergy
were
listened
to
in
contemptuous
silence
or
replied
to
with
bitter
irony
by
those
who
were
conscious
how
little
sympathy
that
body
were
likely
to
meet
from
the
nation
in
general
and
who
therefore
spoke
as
having
power
to
do
wrong
we
must
now
revert
to
the
condition
of
the
kingdom
of
france
at
large
while
her
ancient
institutions
were
crumbling
to
pieces
of
themselves
or
were
forcibly
pulled
down
by
state
innovators
that
fine
country
was
ravaged
by
a
civil
war
of
aggravated
horrors
waged
betwixt
the
rich
and
poor
and
marked
by
every
species
of
brutal
violence
the
peasants
their
minds
filled
with
a
thousand
wild
suppositions
and
incensed
by
the
general
scarcity
of
provisions
were
every
where
in
arms
and
every
where
attacked
the
chateaux
of
their
whom
they
were
incited
to
look
upon
as
enemies
of
the
revolution
and
particularly
of
the
commons
in
most
instances
they
were
successful
and
burnt
the
dwellings
of
the
nobility
practising
all
the
circumstances
of
rage
and
cruelty
by
which
the
minds
of
barbarians
are
influenced
men
were
murdered
in
presence
of
their
wives
wives
and
daughters
violated
before
the
eyes
of
their
husbands
and
parents
some
were
put
to
death
by
lingering
tortures
others
by
sudden
and
general
massacre
against
some
of
these
unhappy
gentlemen
doubtless
the
peasants
might
have
wrongs
to
remember
and
to
avenge
many
of
them
however
had
borne
their
faculties
so
meekly
that
they
did
not
even
suspect
the
ill
intentions
of
these
peasants
until
their
castles
and
kindled
with
the
general
conflagration
and
made
part
of
the
devouring
element
which
raged
through
the
whole
kingdom
what
were
the
national
assembly
doing
at
this
dreadful
crisis
they
were
discussing
the
abstract
doctrines
of
the
rights
of
man
instead
of
exacting
from
the
subject
the
respect
due
to
his
social
duties
yet
a
large
party
in
the
convention
and
who
had
hitherto
led
the
way
in
the
paths
of
the
revolution
now
conceived
that
the
goal
was
attained
and
that
it
was
time
to
use
the
curb
and
forbear
the
spur
such
was
the
opinion
of
la
fayette
and
his
followers
who
considered
the
victory
over
the
royalists
as
complete
and
were
desirous
to
declare
the
revolution
ended
and
erect
a
substantial
form
of
government
on
the
ruins
of
monarchy
which
lay
prostrate
at
their
feet
they
had
influence
enough
in
the
assembly
to
procure
a
set
of
resolutions
declaring
the
monarchy
hereditary
in
the
person
of
the
king
and
present
family
on
which
basis
they
proceeded
to
erect
what
might
be
termed
a
royal
democracy
or
in
plainer
terms
a
republic
governed
in
truth
by
a
popular
assembly
but
encumbered
with
the
expense
of
a
king
to
whom
they
desired
to
leave
no
real
power
or
free
will
to
exercise
it
although
his
name
was
to
remain
in
the
front
of
edicts
and
although
he
was
still
to
be
considered
entitled
to
command
their
armies
as
the
executive
authority
of
the
state
sidenote
the
veto
a
struggle
was
made
to
extend
the
royal
authority
to
an
absolute
negative
upon
the
decrees
of
the
representative
body
and
though
it
was
limited
by
the
jealousy
of
the
popular
party
to
a
suspensive
veto
only
yet
even
this
degree
of
influence
was
supposed
too
dangerous
in
the
hands
of
a
monarch
who
had
but
lately
been
absolute
there
is
indeed
an
evident
dilemma
in
the
formation
of
a
democracy
with
a
king
for
its
ostensible
head
either
the
monarch
will
remain
contented
with
his
daily
parade
and
daily
food
and
thus
play
the
part
of
a
mere
pageant
in
which
case
he
is
a
burdensome
expense
to
the
state
which
a
popular
government
in
prudent
economy
as
well
as
from
the
severity
of
principle
assumed
by
republicans
are
particularly
bound
to
avoid
or
else
he
will
naturally
endeavour
to
improve
the
shadow
and
outward
form
of
power
into
something
like
sinew
and
substance
and
the
democracy
will
be
unexpectedly
assailed
with
the
spear
which
they
desired
should
be
used
only
as
their
standard
pole
to
these
reasonings
many
of
the
deputies
would
perhaps
have
answered
had
they
spoken
their
real
sentiments
that
it
was
yet
too
early
to
propose
to
the
french
a
pure
republic
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
render
the
power
of
the
king
insignificant
before
abolishing
a
title
to
which
the
public
ear
had
been
so
long
accustomed
in
the
meantime
they
took
care
to
divest
the
monarch
of
whatever
protection
he
might
have
received
from
an
intermediate
senate
or
chamber
placed
betwixt
the
king
and
the
national
assembly
one
god
exclaimed
rabaut
etienne
one
nation
one
king
and
one
chamber
this
advocate
for
unity
at
once
and
uniformity
would
scarce
have
been
listened
to
if
he
had
added
one
nose
one
tongue
one
arm
and
one
eye
but
his
first
concatenation
of
unities
formed
a
phrase
and
an
imposing
phrase
which
sounds
well
and
can
easily
be
repeated

in
what
a
degraded
state
it
may
be
found
to
exist
females
of
this
description
began
to
assemble
early
in
the
morning
in
large
groups
with
the
cries
for
bread
which
so
easily
rouse
a
starving
metropolis
there
were
amongst
them
many
men
disguised
as
women
and
they
compelled
all
the
females
they
met
to
go
along
with
them
they
marched
to
the
hôtel
de
ville
broke
boldly
through
several
squadrons
of
the
national
guard
who
were
drawn
up
in
front
of
that
building
for
its
defence
and
were
with
difficulty
dissuaded
from
burning
the
records
it
contained
they
next
seized
a
magazine
of
arms
with
three
or
four
pieces
of
cannon
and
were
joined
by
a
miscellaneous
rabble
armed
with
pikes
scythes
and
similar
instruments
who
called
themselves
the
conquerors
of
the
bastile
the
still
increasing
multitude
the
cry
of
bread
bread
to
versailles
to
versailles
the
national
guard
were
now
called
out
in
force
but
speedily
showed
their
officers
that
they
too
were
infected
with
the
humour
of
the
times
and
as
much
indisposed
to
subordination
as
the
mob
to
disperse
which
they
were
summoned
la
fayette
put
himself
at
their
head
not
to
give
his
own
but
to
receive
their
orders
they
refused
to
act
against
women
who
they
said
were
starving
and
in
their
turn
demanded
to
be
led
to
versailles
to
dethrone
such
was
their
language
the
king
who
was
a
driveller
and
place
the
crown
on
the
head
of
his
son
la
fayette
hesitated
implored
explained
but
he
had
as
yet
to
learn
the
situation
of
a
revolutionary
general
is
it
not
strange
said
one
of
his
soldiers
who
seemed
quite
to
understand
the
military
relation
of
officer
and
private
on
such
an
occasion
is
it
not
strange
that
la
fayette
pretends
to
command
the
people
when
it
is
his
part
to
receive
orders
from
them
soon
afterwards
an
order
arrived
from
the
assembly
of
the
commune
of
paris
enjoining
the
commandant
march
upon
his
own
report
that
it
was
impossible
to
withstand
the
will
of
the
people
he
marched
accordingly
in
good
order
and
at
the
head
of
a
large
force
of
the
national
guard
about
four
or
five
hours
after
the
departure
of
the
mob
who
while
he
waited
in
a
state
of
indecision
were
already
far
on
their
way
to
versailles
it
does
not
appear
that
the
king
or
his
ministers
had
any
information
of
these
hostile
movements
assuredly
there
could
not
have
been
a
royalist
in
paris
willing
to
hazard
a
horse
or
a
groom
to
carry
such
intelligence
where
the
knowledge
of
it
must
have
been
so
important
the
leading
members
of
the
assembly
at
versailles
were
better
informed
these
gentlemen
said
barbantanne
looking
at
the
part
of
the
hall
where
the
nobles
and
clergy
usually
sat
wish
more
light
they
shall
have
lanterns
they
may
rely
upon
it
mirabeau
went
behind
the
chair
of
mounier
the
president
paris
is
marching
upon
us
he
i
know
not
what
you
mean
said
believe
me
or
not
all
paris
is
marching
upon
us
dissolve
the
sitting
i
never
hurry
the
deliberations
said
then
feign
illness
said
mirabeau
go
to
the
palace
tell
them
what
i
say
and
give
me
for
authority
but
there
is
not
a
minute
to
lose
paris
marches
upon
us
so
much
the
better
answered
mounier
we
shall
be
a
republic
the
sooner
shortly
after
this
singular
dialogue
occasioned
probably
by
a
sudden
movement
in
which
mirabeau
showed
the
aristocratic
feelings
from
which
he
never
could
shake
himself
free
the
female
battalion
together
with
their
masculine
allies
continued
their
march
uninterruptedly
and
entered
versailles
in
the
afternoon
singing
patriotic
airs
intermingled
with
blasphemous
obscenities
and
the
most
furious
threats
against
the
queen
their
first
visit
was
to
the
national
assembly
where
the
beating
of
drums
shouts
shrieks
and
a
hundred
confused
sounds
interrupted
the
deliberations
a
man
called
mailliard
brandishing
a
sword
in
his
hand
and
supported
by
a
woman
holding
a
long
pole
to
which
was
attached
a
tambour
de
basque
commenced
a
harangue
in
the
name
of
the
sovereign
people
he
announced
that
they
wanted
bread
that
they
were
convinced
the
ministers
were
traitors
that
the
arm
of
the
people
was
uplifted
and
about
to
strike
with
much
to
the
same
purpose
in
the
exaggerated
eloquence
of
the
period
the
same
sentiments
were
echoed
by
his
followers
mingled
with
the
bitterest
threats
against
the
queen
in
particular
that
fury
could
contrive
expressed
in
language
of
the
most
energetic
brutality
the
amazons
then
crowded
into
the
assembly
mixed
themselves
with
the
members
occupied
the
seat
of
the
president
of
the
secretaries
produced
or
procured
victuals
and
wine
drank
sung
swore
scolded
screamed
abused
some
of
the
members
and
loaded
others
with
their
loathsome
caresses
a
deputation
of
these
mad
women
was
at
length
sent
to
st
priest
the
minister
a
determined
royalist
who
received
them
sternly
and
replied
to
their
demand
of
bread
when
you
had
but
one
king
you
never
wanted
bread
you
have
now
twelve
hundred
go
ask
it
of
them
they
were
introduced
to
the
king
however
and
were
so
much
struck
with
the
kind
interest
which
he
took
in
the
state
of
paris
that
their
hearts
relented
in
his
favour
and
the
deputies
returned
to
their
constituents
shouting
vive
le
roi
sidenote
mob
surround
the
palace
had
the
tempest
depended
on
the
mere
popular
breeze
it
might
now
have
been
lulled
to
sleep
but
there
was
a
secret
a
heaving
upwards
of
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
which
could
not
be
conjured
down
by
the
awakened
feelings
or
convinced
understandings
of
the
deputation
a
cry
was
raised
that
the
deputies
had
been
bribed
to
represent
the
king
favourably
and
in
this
humour
of
suspicion
the
army
of
amazons
stripped
their
garters
for
the
purpose
of
strangling
their
own
delegates
they
had
by
this
time
ascertained
that
neither
the
national
guard
of
versailles
nor
the
regiment
of
flanders
whose
transitory
loyalty
had
passed
away
with
the
fumes
of
the
wine
of
the
banquet
would
oppose
them
by
force
and
that
they
had
only
to
deal
with
the
gardes
du
corps
who
dared
not
to
act
with
vigour
lest
they
should
provoke
a
general
attack
on
the
palace
while
the
most
complete
distraction
and
indecision
reigned
within
its
precincts
bold
in
consequence
the
female
mob
seized
on
the
exterior
avenues
of
the
palace
and
threatened
destruction
to
all
within
the
attendants
of
the
king
saw
it
necessary
to
take
measures
for
the
safety
of
his
person
but
they
were
marked
by
indecision
and
confusion
a
force
was
hastily
gathered
of
two
or
three
hundred
gentlemen
who
it
was
proposed
should
mount
the
horses
of
the
royal
stud
and
escort
the
king
to
rambouillet
out
of
this
scene
of
confusion
the
gardes
du
corps
with
such
assistance
might
certainly
have
forced
their
way
through
a
mob
or
the
tumultuary
description
which
surrounded
them
and
the
escape
of
the
king
from
versailles
under
circumstances
so
critical
might
have
had
a
great
effect
in
changing
the
current
of
popular
feeling
but
those
opinions
prevailed
which
recommended
that
he
should
abide
the
arrival
of
la
fayette
with
the
civic
force
of
paris
it
was
now
night
and
the
armed
rabble
of
both
sexes
showed
no
intention
of
departing
or
breaking
up
on
the
contrary
they
bivouacked
after
their
own
manner
upon
the
parade
where
the
soldiers
usually
mustered
there
they
kindled
large
fires
ate
drank
sang
caroused
and
occasionally
discharged
their
firearms
scuffles
arose
from
time
to
time
and
one
or
two
of
the
gardes
du
corps
had
been
killed
and
wounded
in
the
quarrel
which
the
rioters
had
endeavoured
to
fasten
on
them
besides
which
this
devoted
corps
had
sustained
a
volley
from
their
late
guests
the
national
guard
of
versailles
the
horse
of
a
garde
du
corps
which
fell
into
the
hands
of
these
female
demons
was
killed
torn
in
pieces
and
eaten
half
raw
and
half
roasted
every
thing
seemed
tending
to
a
general
engagement
when
late
at
night
the
drums
announced
the
approach
of
la
fayette
at
the
head
of
his
civic
army
which
moved
slowly
but
in
good
order
the
presence
of
this
great
force
seemed
to
restore
a
portion
of
tranquillity
though
no
one
appeared
to
know
with
certainty
how
it
was
likely
to
act
la
fayette
had
an
audience
of
the
king
explained
the
means
he
had
adopted
for
the
security
of
the
palace
recommended
to
the
inhabitants
to
go
to
rest
and
unhappily
set
the
example
by
retiring
himself
before
doing
so
however
he
also
visited
the
assembly
pledged
himself
for
the
safety
of
the
royal
family
and
the
tranquillity
of
the
night
and
with
some
difficulty
prevailed
on
the
president
mounier
to
adjourn
the
sitting
which
had
been
voted
permanent
he
thus
took
upon
himself
the
responsibility
for
the
quiet
of
the
night
we
are
loth
to
bring
into
question
the
worth
honour
and
fidelity
of
la
fayette
and
we
can
therefore
only
lament
that
weariness
should
have
so
far
overcome
him
at
an
important
crisis
and
that
he
should
have
trusted
to
others
the
execution
of
those
precautions
which
were
most
grossly
neglected
a
band
of
the
rioters
found
means
to
penetrate
into
the
palace
about
three
in
the
morning
through
a
gate
which
was
left
unlocked
and
unguarded
they
rushed
to
the
queen
apartment
and
bore
down
the
few
gardes
du
corps
who
hastened
to
her
defence
the
sentinel
knocked
at
the
door
of
her
bedchamber
called
to
her
to
escape
and
then
gallantly
exposed
himself
to
the
fury
of
the
murderers
his
single
opposition
was
almost
instantly
overcome
and
he
himself
left
for
dead
over
his
bleeding
body
they
forced
their
way
into
the
queen
apartment
but
their
victim
reserved
for
farther
and
worse
woes
had
escaped
by
a
secret
passage
into
the
chamber
of
the
king
while
the
assassins
bursting
in
stabbed
the
bed
she
had
just
left
with
pikes
and
swords
sidenote
murder
of
the
body
guards
the
gardes
du
corps
assembled
in
the
called
the
bull
eye
and
endeavoured
there
to
defend
themselves
but
several
unable
to
gain
this
place
of
refuge
were
dragged
down
into
the
courtyard
where
a
wretch
distinguished
by
a
long
beard
a
broad
bloody
axe
and
a
species
of
armour
which
he
wore
on
his
person
had
taken
on
himself
by
taste
and
choice
the
office
of
executioner
the
strangeness
of
the
costume
the
sanguinary
relish
with
which
he
discharged
his
office
and
the
hoarse
roar
with
which
from
time
to
time
he
demanded
new
victims
made
him
resemble
some
demon
whom
hell
had
vomited
forth
to
augment
the
wickedness
and
horror
of
the
scene
two
of
the
gardes
du
corps
were
already
beheaded
and
the
man
with
the
beard
was
clamorous
to
do
his
office
upon
the
others
who
had
been
taken
when
la
fayette
roused
from
his
repose
arrived
at
the
head
of
a
body
of
grenadiers
of
the
old
french
guards
who
had
been
lately
incorporated
with
the
civic
guard
and
were
probably
the
most
efficient
part
of
his
force
he
did
not
think
of
avenging
the
unfortunate
gentlemen
who
lay
murdered
before
his
eyes
for
the
discharge
of
their
military
duty
but
he
entreated
his
soldiers
to
save
him
the
dishonour
of
breaking
his
word
which
he
had
pledged
to
the
king
that
he
would
protect
the
gardes
du
corps
it
is
probable
he
attempted
no
more
than
was
in
his
power
and
so
far
acted
wisely
if
not
generously
to
redeem
de
la
fayette
pledge
the
grenadiers
did
what
they
ought
to
have
done
in
the
name
of
the
king
the
law
the
nation
and
insulted
humanity
they
cleared
and
with
perfect
ease
the
court
of
the
palace
from
these
bands
of
murderous
bacchantes
and
their
male
associates
the
instinct
of
ancient
feelings
was
in
some
degree
awakened
in
the
grenadiers
they
experienced
a
sudden
sensation
of
compassion
and
kindness
for
the
gardes
du
corps
whose
duty
on
the
royal
person
they
had
in
former
times
shared
there
arose
a
cry
among
them
let
us
save
the
gardes
du
corps
who
saved
us
at
fontenoy
they
took
them
under
their
protection
exchanged
their
caps
with
them
in
sign
of
friendship
and
fraternity
and
a
tumult
which
had
something
of
the
character
of
joy
succeeded
to
that
which
had
announced
nothing
but
blood
and
death
the
outside
of
the
palace
was
still
besieged
by
the
infuriated
mob
who
demanded
with
hideous
cries
and
exclamations
the
most
barbarous
and
obscene
to
see
the
austrian
as
they
called
the
queen
the
unfortunate
princess
appeared
on
the
balcony
with
one
of
her
children
in
each
hand
a
voice
from
the
crowd
called
out
no
children
as
if
on
purpose
to
deprive
the
mother
of
that
appeal
to
humanity
which
might
move
the
hardest
heart
marie
antoinette
with
a
force
of
mind
worthy
of
maria
theresa
her
mother
pushed
her
children
back
into
the
room
and
turning
her
face
to
the
tumultuous
multitude
which
tossed
and
roared
beneath
brandishing
their
pikes
and
guns
with
the
wildest
attitudes
of
rage
the
reviled
persecuted
and
denounced
queen
stood
before
them
her
arms
folded
on
her
bosom
with
a
noble
air
of
courageous
resignation
the
secret
reason
of
this
summons
the
real
cause
of
repelling
the
children
could
only
be
to
afford
a
chance
of
some
desperate
hand
among
the
crowd
executing
the
threats
which
resounded
on
all
sides
accordingly
a
gun
was
actually
levelled
but
one
of
the
bystanders
struck
it
down
for
the
passions
of
the
mob
had
taken
an
opposite
turn
and
astonished
at
marie
antoinette
noble
presence
and
graceful
firmness
of
demeanour
there
arose
almost
in
spite
of
themselves
a
general
shout
of
vive
la
reine
but
if
the
insurgents
or
rather
those
who
prompted
them
missed
their
first
point
they
did
not
also
lose
their
second
a
cry
arose
to
paris
at
first
uttered
by
a
solitary
voice
but
gathering
strength
until
the
whole
multitude
shouted
to
paris
to
paris
the
cry
of
these
bacchanals
such
as
they
had
that
night
shown
themselves
was
it
seems
considered
as
the
voice
of
the
people
and
as
such
la
fayette
neither
remonstrated
himself
nor
permitted
the
king
to
interpose
a
moment
delay
in
yielding
obedience
to
it
nor
was
any
measure
taken
to
put
some
appearance
even
of
decency
on
the
journey
or
to
disguise
its
real
character
of
a
triumphant
procession
of
the
sovereign
people
after
a
complete
victory
over
their
nominal
monarch
sidenote
procession
to
paris
the
carriages
of
the
royal
family
were
placed
in
the
middle
of
an
immeasurable
column
consisting
partly
of
la
fayette
soldiers
partly
of
the
revolutionary
rabble
whose
march
had
preceded
his
amounting
to
several
thousand
men
and
women
of
the
lowest
and
most
desperate
description
intermingling
in
groups
amongst
the
bands
of
french
guards
and
civic
soldiers
whose
discipline
could
not
enable
them
to
preserve
even
a
semblance
of
order
thus
they
rushed
along
howling
their
songs
of
triumph
the
harbingers
of
the
march
bore
the
two
bloody
heads
of
the
murdered
gardes
du
corps
paraded
on
pikes
at
the
head
of
the
column
as
the
emblems
of
their
prowess
and
success
the
rest
of
this
body
worn
down
by
fatigue
most
of
them
despoiled
of
their
arms
and
many
without
hats
anxious
for
the
fate
of
the
royal
family
and
harassed
with
apprehensions
for
themselves
were
dragged
like
captives
in
the
midst
of
the
mob
while
the
drunken
females
around
them
bore
aloft
in
triumph
their
arms
their
belts
and
their
hats
these
wretches
stained
with
the
blood
in
which
they
had
bathed
themselves
were
now
singing
songs
of
which
the
burden
bore
we
bring
you
the
baker
his
wife
and
the
little
apprentice
as
if
the
presence
of
the
unhappy
royal
family
with
the
little
power
they
now
possessed
had
been
in
itself
a
charm
against
scarcity
some
of
these
amazons
rode
upon
the
cannon
which
made
a
formidable
part
of
the
procession
many
of
them
were
mounted

were
about
to
revive
in
the

under
his
royal
eye
and
that
the

would
henceforth
become
powerful

the

the

through
the

and
what
was
truest
of
all
that
as

of
reconquering

louis

had
done

altogether
independent
of
their
sovereign

indeed
of

but
that
which
they
chose
to
submit
to
the
second
deprived
the
king
of
that
small
appearance
of
freedom
which
he
had
hitherto
exercised
and
fixed
his
dwelling
in
the
midst
of

it
it
is
wonderful

love
of
liberty
on

sides
i
am
the
only
person
that
is
deemed
totally
unworthy
of
enjoying
it
indeed
after
the
march
from
versailles
the
king
could
only
be
considered
as
the
signet
of
royal
authority
used
for
attesting
public
acts
at
the
pleasure
of
those
in
whose
custody
he
was
detained
but
without
the
exercise
of
any
on
his
own
part
all
the
various
parties
found
their
account
less

more

this

the
royal

the
pure

was

views
of
the

the
constitutional
party
or
those
who
desired
a
democratical
government
with
a
king
at
its
head
had
reason
to
hope
that
louis
being
in
paris
must
remain
at
their
absolute
disposal
separated
from
those
who
might
advise
steps
and
guarded
only
by
national
troops
embodied
in
the
name
and
through
the
powers
of
the
revolution
every
day
indeed
rendered
louis
more
dependent
on
la
fayette
and
his
friends
as
the
only
force
which
remained
to
preserve
order
for
he
soon
found
it
a
necessary
though
a
cruel
measure
to
disband
his
faithful
gardes
du
corps
and
that
perhaps
as
much
with
a
view
to
their
safety
as
to
his
own
the
constitutional
party
seemed
strong
both
in
numbers
and
reputation
la
fayette
was
commandant
of
the
national
guards
and
they
looked
up
to
him
with
that
homage
and
veneration
with
which
young
troops
and
especially
of
this
description
regard
a
leader
of
experience
and
bravery
who
in
accepting
the
command
seems
to
share
his
laurels
with
the
who
has
won
none
of
his
own
bailli
was
mayor
of
paris
and
in
the
height
of
a
popularity
not
undeserved
was
so
well
established
in
the
minds
of
the
better
class
of
citizens
that
in
any
other
times
than
those
in
which
he
lived
he
might
safely
have
despised
the
suffrages
of
the
rabble
always
to
be
bought
either
by
largesses
or
flattery
the
constitutionalists
had
also
a
strong
majority
in
the
assembly
where
the
republicans
dared
not
yet
throw
off
the
mask
and
the
assembly
following
the
person
of
the
king
came
also
to
establish
its
sittings
in
their
stronghold
the
metropolis
they
seemed
therefore
to
assume
the
ascendency
in
the
first
instance
after
the
and
of
october
and
to
reap
all
the
first
fruits
of
the
victory
then
achieved
though
by
their
connivance
rather
than
their
active
it
is
wonderful
that
meaning
still
to
assign
to
the
regal
dignity
a
high
constitutional
situation
la
fayette
should
not
have
exerted
himself
to
preserve
its
dignity
undegraded
and
to
save
the
honour
as
he
certainly
saved
the
lives
of
the
royal
family
three
reasons
might
prevent
his
doing
what
as
a
gentleman
and
a
soldier
he
must
otherwise
at
least
have
attempted
first
although
he
boasted
highly
of
his
influence
with
the
national
guard
of
paris
it
may
be
doubted
whether
all
his
popularity
would
have
borne
him
through
in
any
endeavour
to
deprive
the
good
people
of
that
city
of
such
a
treat
as
the
joyous
entry
of
the
of
october
or
whether
the
civic
power
would
even
for
the
immediate
defence
of
the
king
person
have
used
actual
force
against
the
band
of
amazons
who
directed
that
memorable
procession
secondly
la
fayette
might
fear
the
revival
of
the
fallen
colossus
of
despotism
more
than
the
rising
spirit
of
anarchy
and
thus
be
induced
to
suppose
that
a
conquest
in
the
king
cause
over
a
popular
insurrection
might
be
too
active
a
cordial
to
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
royalists
and
lastly
the
revolutionary
general
as
a
politician
might
not
be
unwilling
that
the
king
and
his
consort
should
experience
in
their
own
persons
such
a
specimen
of
popular
power
as
might
intimidate
them
from
further
opposition
to
the
popular
will
and
incline
louis
to
assume
unresistingly
his
diminished
rank
in
the
new
constitution
the
republican
party
with
better
reason
than
the
constitutionalists
exulted
in
the
king
change
of
residence
it
relieved
them
as
well
as
fayette
party
from
all
apprehension
of
louis
raising
his
standard
in
the
provinces
and
taking
the
field
on
his
own
account
like
charles
of
england
in
similar
circumstances
then
they
already
foresaw
that
whenever
the
constitutionalists
should
identify
themselves
with
the
crown
whom
all
parties
had
hitherto
laboured
to
represent
as
the
common
enemy
they
would
become
proportionally
unpopular
with
the
people
at
large
and
lose
possession
of
the
superior
power
as
a
necessary
consequence
aristocrats
the
only
class
which
was
sincerely
united
to
the
king
person
would
they
might
safely
predict
dread
and
distrust
the
constitutionalists
while
with
the
democrats
so
very
much
the
more
numerous
party
the
king
name
instead
of
a
tower
of
strength
as
the
poet
has
termed
it
must
be
a
and
a
rock
of
offence
they
foresaw
finally
either
that
the
king
must
remain
the
mere
passive
tool
of
the
constitutionalists
acting
unresistingly
under
their
order
in
which
case
the
office
would
be
soon
regarded
as
an
idle
and
expensive
bauble
without
any
force
or
dignity
of
and
fit
only
to
be
flung
aside
as
an
unnecessary
incumbrance
on
the
republican
forms
or
in
the
event
of
the
king
attempting
either
by
force
or
escape
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
the
constitutionalists
he
would
equally
furnish
arms
to
the
pure
democrats
against
his
person
and
office
as
the
source
of
danger
to
the
popular
cause
some
of
the
republican
chiefs
had
probably
expected
a
more
sudden
termination
to
the
reign
of
louis
from
an
insurrection
so
threatening
at
least
these
leaders
had
been
the
first
to
hail
and
to
encourage
the
female
insurgents
on
their
arrival
at
versailles
but
though
the
issue
of
that
insurrection
may
have
fallen
short
of
their
hopes
it
could
not
but
be
highly
acceptable

them

orleans

the
party
of
orleans
had
hitherto
wrapt
in
its
dusky
folds
many
of
those
names
which
were
afterwards
destined
to
hold
dreadful
rank
in
the
revolutionary
history
the
prince
whose
name
they
adopted
is
supposed
to
have
been
animated
partly
by
a
strong
and
embittered
spirit
of
personal
hatred
against
the
queen
and
partly
as
we
have
already
said
by
an
ambitious
desire

supplant

he
placed
according
to

his
treasures

all
which
his
credit
could

abounding
in
those
energetic
talents
which
carry
their
owners
forward
in
times
of
public
confusion

devoid
alike
of

serve
their

enlisting
in

the
obscure
and
subordinate
agents
by
whom

were
levied

it
is
said
that
the
days
of
the

of

were
organized
by
the
secret
agents
of

for
his
advantage
that
had
the
enterprise
succeeded
the
king
would
have
been
deposed
and
the
duke
of
orleans
proclaimed
of
the
kingdom
while
his
revenge
would
probably
have
been
satiated
with
the
queen
assassination

is
stated
to
have
skulked
in

about
the
outskirts
of

scene
when
the
tumult
was
at

highest

never

had
courage
to
present
himself
boldly
to
the
people

to
create
a
sensation
by
surprise
or
to

himself
of
that
which
his
satellites
had
already
excited
in
his
favour
his
resolution
having
thus
failed
him
at
the
point
where
it
was
most
necessary
and
the
tumult
having
ended
without
any
thing
taking
place
in
his

the
duke
of

was
made

the
only

unworthy

had
been
taken
on

account
his
other
adherents
gradually
and
successively
dropped
away
in

as
the
wealth

and
character
of
this
besotted

rendered
him
incapable

his

had

assassins
and
the
active
citizen
who
carried
the
head
was
tried
condemned
and
hanged
just
as
if
there
had
been
no
revolution
in
the
kingdom
there
was
much
surprise
at
this
as
there
had
been
no
such
instance
of
severity
since
the
day
of
the
bastile
this
was
not
all
la
fayette
who
may
now
be
considered
as
at
the
head
of
affairs
had
the
influence
and
address
to
gain
from
the
assembly
a
decree
empowering
the
magistracy
in
case
of
any
rising
to
declare
martial
law
by
displaying
a
red
flag
after
which
signal
those
who
refused
to
disperse
should
be
dealt
with
as
open
rebels
this
edict
much
to
the
purpose
of
the
british
riot
act
did
not
pass
without
opposition
as
it
obviously
tended
to
give
the
bayonets
of
the
national
guard
a
decided
ascendency
over
the
pikes
and
clubs
of
the
rabble
of
the
suburbs
the
jacobins
meaning
the
followers
of
marat
robespierre
and
danton
and
even
the
republicans
or
brissotines
had
hitherto
considered
these
occasional
insurrections
and
murders
like
affairs
of
posts
in
a
campaign
in
which
they
themselves
had
enjoyed
uniformly
the
advantage
but
while
la
fayette
was
followed
and
obeyed
by
the
national
guard
men
of
substance
and
interested
in
maintaining
order
it
was
clear
that
he
had
both
the
power
and
will
to
stop
in
future
these
revolutionary
excesses
this
important
advantage
in
some
degree
balanced
the
power
which
the
republican
and
revolutionary
party
had
acquired
these
predominated
as
has
been
already
said
in
the
club
of
jacobins
in
which
they
reviewed
the
debates
of
the
assembly
denouncing
at
their
pleasure
those
who
opposed
them
but
they
had
besides
a
decided
majority
among
the
daily
attendants
in
the
tribunes
who
regularly
paid
and
supplied
with
food
and
liquors
filled
the
assembly
with
their
clamours
of
applause
or
disapprobation
according
to
the
rules
they
had
previously
received
it
is
true
the
hired
auditors
gave
their
voices
and
applause
to
those
who
paid
them
but
nevertheless
they
had
party
feelings
of
their
own
which
often
dictated
unbought
suffrages
in
favour
of
those
who
used
the
most
exaggerated
tone
of
revolutionary
fury
they
shouted
with
sincere
and
voluntary
zeal
for
such
men
as
marat
robespierre
and
danton
who
yelled
out
for
the
most
bloody
measures
of
terror
and
proscription
and
proclaimed
war
against
the
nobles
with
the
same
voice
with
which
they
flattered
the
lowest
vices
of
the
multitude
by
degrees
the
revolution
appeared
to
have
assumed
a
different
object
from
that
for
which
it
was
commenced
france
had
obtained
liberty
the
first
and
certainly
the
worthiest
object
which
a
nation
can
desire
each
individual
was
declared
as
free
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
retaining
the
least
respect
to
the
social
compact
it
is
true
the
frenchman
was
not
practically
allowed
the
benefit
of
this
freedom
for
though
the
rights
of
man
permitted
the
citizen
to
go
where
he
would
yet
in
practice
he
was
apt
to
find
his
way
to
the
next
prison
unless
furnished
with
a
municipal
passport
or
to
be
murdered
by
the
way
if
accused
of
aristocracy
in
like
manner
his
house
was
secure
as
a
castle
his
property
sacred
as
the
ornaments
of
a
temple
excepting
against
the
committee
of
research
who
might
by
their
arbitrary
order
break
into
the
one
and
dilapidate
the
other
at
pleasure
still
however
the
general
principle
of
liberty
was
established
in
the
fullest
metaphysical
extent
and
it
remained
to
place
on
as
broad
a
footing
the
sister
principle
of
equality
to
this
the
attention
of
the
assembly
was
now
chiefly
directed
in
the
proper
sense
equality
of
rights
and
equality
of
laws
a
constitution
which
extends
like
protection
to
the
lowest
and
the
highest
are
essential
to
the
existence
and
to
the
enjoyment
of
freedom
but
to
erect
a
levelling
system
designed
to
place
the
whole
mass
of
the
people
on
the
same
footing
as
to
habits
manners
tastes
and
sentiments
is
a
gross
and
ridiculous
contradiction
of
the
necessary
progress
of
society
it
is
a
fruitless
attempt
to
wage
war
with
the
laws
of
nature
she
has
varied
the
face
of
the
world
with
mountain
and
valley
lake
and
torrent
forest
and
champaign
and
she
has
formed
the
human
body
in
all
the
different
shapes
and
complexions
we
behold
with
all
the
various
degrees
of
physical
force
and
weakness
she
has
avoided
equality
in
all
her
productions
as
she
was
formerly
said
to
have
abhorred
a
vacuum
even
in
those
of
her
works
which
present
the
greatest
apparent
similarity
exact
equality
does
not
exist
no
one
leaf
of
a
tree
is
precisely
similar
to
another
and
among
the
countless
host
of
stars
each
differs
from
the
other
in
glory
but
what
are
these
physical
varieties
to
the
endless
change
exhibited
in
the
human
character
with
all
its
various
passions
powers
and
prejudices
so
artfully
compounded
in
different
proportions
that
it
is
probable
there
has
not
existed
since
adam
time
to
ours
an
exact
resemblance
between
any
two
individuals
as
if
this
were
not
enough
there
came
to
aid
the
diversity
the
effects
of
climate
of
government
of
education
and
habits
of
life
all
of
which
lead
to
endless
modifications
of
the
individual
the
inequalities
arising
from
the
natural
differences
of
talent
and
disposition
are
multiplied
beyond
calculation
as
society
increases
in
civilisation
the
savage
may
indeed
boast
a
rude
species
of
equality
in
some
patriarchal
tribes
but
the
wiliest
and
strongest
the
best
hunter
and
the
bravest
warrior
soon
lords
it
over
the
rest
and
becomes
a
king
or
a
chief
one
portion
of
the
nation
from
happy
talents
or
happy
circumstances
rises
to
the
top
another
sinks
like
dregs
to
the
bottom
a
third
portion
occupies
a
mid
place
between
them
as
society
advances
the
difference
of
ranks
advances
with
it
and
can
it
be
proposed
seriously
that
any
other
equality
than
that
of
rights
can
exist
between
those
who
think
and
those
who
labour
those
whose
talk
is
of
bullocks
and
those
whose
time
permits
them
to
study
the
paths
of
wisdom
happy
indeed
is
the
country
and
constitution
where
those
distinctions
which
must
necessarily
exist
in
every
society
are
not
separated
by
insurmountable
barriers
but
where
the
most
distinguished
rank
is
open
to
receive
that
precious
supply
of
wisdom
and
talent
which
so
frequently
elevates
individuals
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
classes
and
so
far
as
general
equality
can
be
attained
by
each
individual
having
a
fair
right
to
raise
himself
to
the
situation
which
he
is
qualified
to
occupy
by
his
talents
his
merits
or
his
wealth
the
gates
can
not
be
thrown
open
too
widely
but
the
attempt
of
the
french
legislators
was
precisely
the
reverse
and
went
to
establish
the
proposed
equality
of
ranks
by
depressing
the
upper
classes
into
the
same
order
with
those
who
occupy
the
middle
of
society
while
they
essayed
the
yet
more
absurd
attempt
to
crush
down
these
last
by
the
weight
of
legislative
authority
into
a
level
with
the
lowest
orders
men
whose
education
if
it
has
not
corrupted
their
hearts
must
necessarily
have
blunted
their
feelings
and
who
in
a
great
city
like
paris
exchange
the
simplicity
which
makes
them
respectable
under
more
favourable
circumstances
for
the
habitual
indulgence
of
the
coarsest
and
grossest
pleasures
upon
the
whole
it
must
be
admitted
that
in
every
state
far
advanced
in
the
progress
of
civilisation
the
inequality
of
ranks
is
a
natural
and
necessary
attribute
philosophy
may
comfort
those
who
regret
this
necessity
by
the
assurance
that
the
portions
of
individual
happiness
and
misery
are
divided
amongst
high
and
low
with
a
very
equal
hand
and
religion
assures
us
that
there
is
a
future
state
in
which
with
amended
natures
and
improved
faculties
the
vain
distinctions
of
this
world
will
no
longer
subsist
but
any
practical
attempt
to
remedy
the
inequality
of
rank
in
civilized
society
by
forcible
measures
may
indeed
degrade
the
upper
classes
but
can
not
improve
those
beneath
them
laws
may
deprive
the
gentleman
of
his
title
the
man
of
education
of
his
books
or
to
use
the
french
illustration
the
of
his
clothes
but
this
can
not
make
the
clown
a
man
of
breeding
or
give
learning
to
ignorance
or
decent
attire
to
the
sans
culottes
much
will
be
lost
to
the
grace
the
information
and
the
decency
of
society
in
general
but
nothing
can
possibly
be
gained
by
any
individual
nevertheless
it
was
in
this
absolutely
impracticable
manner
that
the
exaggerated
feelings
of
the
french
legislators
at
this
period
of
total
change
undertook
to
equalize
the
nation
which
they
were
regenerating
sidenote
abolition
of
titles
of
honour
with
a
view
to
this
great
experiment
upon
human
society
the
assembly
abolished
all
titles
of
honour
all
armorial
bearings
and
even
the
insignificant
titles
of
monsieur
and
madame
which
meaning
nothing
but
phrases
of
common
courtesy
yet
with
other
expressions
of
the
same
kind
serve
to
soften
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
human
life
and
preserve
that
gentleness
of
manners
which
the
french
by
a
happy
name
were
wont
to
call
la
petite
morale
the
first
of
these
abrogations
affected
the
nobles
in
particular
in
return
for
their
liberal
and
unlimited
surrender
of
their
essential
powers
and
privileges
they
were
now
despoiled
of
their
distinction
and
rank
in
society
as
if
those
who
had
made
prisoner
and
plundered
a
cavalier
should
last
of
all
have
snatched
away
in
derision
the
plume
from
his
hat
the
aristocracy
of
france
so
long
distinguished
as
the
flower
of
european
chivalry
were
now
so
far
as
depended
on
the
legislature
entirely
abolished
the
voice
of
the
nation
had
pronounced
against
them
a
general
sentence
of
degradation
which
according
to
the
feelings
of
the
order
could
only
be
the
punishment
of
some
foul
and
disgraceful
crime
and
the
condition
of
the
might
justly
have
been
described
as
bolingbroke
paints

the
bitter
bread
of
banishment
whilst
you
have
fed
upon
my
signories
dispark

parks
and
fell

my
impress
leaving
me
no
sign
save
men
opinions
and
my
living
blood
to

i
was
a
gentleman
it
was
a
fatal
error
that
in
search
of
that
equality
which
it
is
impossible
to
attain
the
assembly
should
have
torn
down
the
ancient
institutions
of
chivalry
viewing
them
philosophically
they
are
indeed
of
little
value
but
where
are
the
advantages
beyond
the
means
first
of
mere
subsistence
secondly
of
information
which
ought
not
to
be
indifferent
to
true
philosophers
and
yet
where
exists
the
true
philosopher
who
has
been
able
effectually
to
detach
himself
from
the
common
mode
of
thinking
on
such
subjects
the
estimation
set
upon
birth
or
rank
supposing
its
foundation
illusory
has
still
the
advantage
of
counterbalancing
that
which
is
attracted
by
wealth
only
the
prejudice
has
something
generous
and
noble
in
it
is
connected
with
historical
recollections
and
patriotic
feelings
and
if
it
sometimes
gives
rise
to
extravagances
they
are
such
as
society
can
restrain
and
punish
by
the
mere
effect
of
ridicule
it
is
curious
even
in
the
midst
of
the
revolution
and
amongst
those
who
were
its
greatest
favourers
what
difficulties
were
found
to
emancipate
themselves
from
those
ancient
prejudices
which
affected
the
difference
of
ranks
as
for
the
proscription
of
the
phraseology
of
civilized
society
it
had
an
absurd
appearance
of
affectation
in
the
eyes
of
most
people
of
understanding
but
on
some
enthusiastic
minds
it
produced
a
worse
effect
than
that
of
mere
disgust
let
a
man
place
himself
in
the
attitude
of
fear
or
of
rage
and
he
will
in
some
measure
feel
the
passion
arise
in
his
mind
which
corresponds
with
the
gesture
he
has
assumed
in
like
manner
those
who
affected
the
brutal
manners
coarse
language
and
slovenly
dress
of
the
lower
orders
familiarized
their
imaginations
with
the
violent
and
savage
thoughts
and
actions
proper
to
the
class
whose
costume
they
had
thus
adopted
above
all
when
this
sacrifice
was
made
to
the
very
taste
and
phraseology
of
that
class
the
last
points
in
which
one
would
think
them
deserving
of
imitation
it
appeared
to
intimate
the
progressive
strength
of
the
revolutionary
tide
which
sweeping
before
it
all
distinctions
trivial
as
well
as
important
seemed
soon
destined
to
overthrow
the
throne
now
isolated
and
wellnigh
undefended
the
next
step
was
necessarily
to
fix
the
executive
government
in
the
same
body
which
enjoyed
the
powers
of
legislation
the
surest
of
all
roads
to
tyranny
but
although
the
doctrine
of
equality
thus
understood
is
absurd
in
theory
and
impossible
in
practice
yet
it
will
always
find
willing
listeners
when
preached
to
the
lower
classes
whose
practical
view
of
it
results
into
an
agrarian
law
or
a
general
division
of
property
there
was
one
order
yet
remaining
however
which
was
to
be
levelled
the
destruction
of
the
church
was
still
to
be
accomplished
and
the
republican
party
proceeded
in
the
work
of
demolition
with
infinite
address
by
including
the
great
object
in
a
plan
for
restoring
finance
and
providing
for
the
expenses
of
the
state
without
imposing
further
burdens
on
the
people
sidenote
disorder
of
finances
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
had
been
summoned
to
restore
the
finances
of
the
country
this
was
the
cause
of
their
convocation
but
although
they
had
exercised
almost
every
species
of
power
had
thrown
down
and
rebuilt
every
constituted
authority
in
the
kingdom
still
the
finances
were
as
much
embarrassed
as
ever
or
much
more
so
since
most
men
in
france
judged
the
privilege
of
refusing
to
pay
taxes
the
most
unequivocal
and
not
the
least
pleasing
part
of
their
freedom
necker
so
often
received
among
the
populace
as
a
saviour
of
the
country
was
here
totally
at
a
loss
the
whole
relative
associations
which
bind
men
together
in
the
social
contract
seemed
to
be
rent
asunder
and
where
public
credit
is
destroyed
a
financier
however
able
resembles
prospero
after
his
wand
is
broken
and
his
book
sunk
in
the
deep
sea
accordingly
necker
in
vain
importuned
the
assembly
by
representing
the
pressure
of
the
finances
they
became
wearied
with
his
remonstrances
and
received
them
with
manifest
symptoms
of
coldness
and
disrespect
what
service
indeed
could
the
regulated
advice
and
and
combined
schemes
of
a
financier
have
rendered
to
men
who
had
already
their
resources
in
their
eye
and
were
determined
that
no
idle
scruple
should
prevent
their
pouncing
upon
them
expostulations
addressed
to
their
ears
were
like
a
lecture
upon
thrift
and
industry
to
robin
hood
and
his
when
they
were
setting
forth
to
rob
the
rich
in
the
name
of
the
poor
the
assembly
had
determined
that
all
prejudices
apart
the
property
of
the
church
should
come
under
confiscation
for
the
benefit
of
the
nation
it
was
in
vain
that
the
clergy
exclaimed
against
these
acts
of
rapine
and
extortion
in
vain
that
they
stated
themselves
as
an
existing
part
of
the
nation
and
that
as
such
they
had
coalesced
with
the
assembly
under
the
implied
ratification
of
their
own
rights
in
vain
that
they
resounded
in
the
hall
the
declaration
solemnly
adopted
that
property
was
inviolable
save
upon
full
compensation
it
was
to
as
little
purpose
that
mirabeau
was
reminded
of
his
language
addressed
to
the
emperor
joseph
upon
a
similar
despise
the
monks
he
had
said
as
much
as
you
will
but
do
not
rob
them
robbery
is
equally
a
crime
whether
perpetrated
on
the
most
profligate
atheist
or
the
most
bigoted
capuchin
the
clergy
were
told
with
insulting
gravity
that
the
property
belonging
to
a
community
was
upon
a
different
footing
from
that
belonging
to
individuals
because
the
state
might
dissolve
the
community
or
and
resume
the
property
attached
to
it
and
under
this
sophism
they
assumed
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
the
whole
right
of
property
belonging
to
the
church
of
france
sidenote
confiscation
of
church
lands
as
it
was
impossible
to
bring
these
immense
subjects
at
once
to
sale
the
assembly
adopted
a
system
of
called
which
were
secured
or
hypothecated
upon
the
the
fluctuation
of
this
paper
which
was
adopted
against
necker
earnest
cautions
created
a
spirit
of
and
gambling
nearly
resembling
that
which
distinguished
the
famous
scheme
of
the
mississippi
spelman
would
have
argued
that
the
taint
of
sacrilege
attached
to
funds
raised
upon
the
spoils
of
the
church
yet
it
must
be
admitted
that
these
supplies
enabled
the
national
assembly
not
only
to
avoid
the
gulf
of
general
bankruptcy
but
to
dispense
with
many
territorial
exactions
which
pressed
hard
on
the
lower
orders
and
to
give
relief
and
breath
to
that
most
useful
portion
of
the
community
these
desirable
results
however
flowed
from
that
divine
alchymy
which
calls
good
out
of
evil
without
affording
a
justification
to
the
perpetrators
of
the
latter
shortly
after
the
adoption
of
this
plan
embraced
against
his
opinion
and
his
remonstrances
necker
saw
his
services
were
no
longer
acceptable
to
the
assembly
and
that
he
could
not
be
useful
to
the
king
he
tendered
his
resignation
which
was
received
with
cold
indifference
by
the
assembly
and
even
his
safety
was
endangered
on
his
return
to
his
native
country
by
the
very
people
who
had
twice
hailed
him
as
their
deliverer
this
accomplished
statesman
discovered
too
late
that
public
opinion
requires
to
be
guided
and
directed
towards
the
ends
of
public
good
which
it
will
not
reach
by
its
own
unassisted
and
misdirected
efforts
and
that
his
own
popularity
had
only
been
the
through
means
of
which
men
less
honest
and
more
subtle
than
himself
had
taken
aim
at
their
own
objects
but
the
majority
of
the
national
assembly
had
yet
another
and
even
a
more
violent
experiment
to
try
upon
the
gallican
church
establishment
it
was
one
which
touched
the
consciences
of
the
french
clergy
in
the
same
degree
as
the
former
affected
their
fortunes
and
was
so
much
the
less
justifiable
that
it
is
difficult
to
suggest
any
motive
except
the
sweeping
desire
to
introduce
novelty
in
every
department
of
the
state
and
to
have
a
constitutional
clergy
as
they
had
a
constitutional
king
which
should
have
instigated
them
to
such
a
measure
when
the
assembly
had
decreed
the
assumption
of
the
it
remained
to
be
settled
on
what
foundation
religion
was
to
be
placed
within
the
kingdom
a
motion
was
made
for
decreeing
that
the
holy
apostolical
religion
was
that
of
france
and
that
its
worship
alone
should
be
permitted
a
carthusian
monk
named
dom
gerle
made
this
proposal
alarmed
too
late
lest
the
popular
party
to
which
he
had
so
long
adhered
should
now
be
about
to
innovate
in
the
matters
of
the
church
as
they
had
already
in
those
of
the
state
the
debate
was
conducted
with
decency
for
one
day
but
on
the
second
the
hall
of
the
assembly
was
surrounded
by
a
large
and
furious
multitude
who
insulted
beat
and
maltreated
all
who
were
known
to
favour
the
measure
under
consideration
it
was
represented
within
the
house
that
the
passing
the
decree
proposed
would
be
the
signal
for
a
religious
war
and
dom
gerle
withdrew
his
motion
in
terror
and
despair
the
success
of
this
opposition
showed
that
almost
any
experiment
on
the
church
might
be
tried
with
effect
since
the
religion
which
it
taught
seemed
no
longer
to
interest
the
national
legislators
a
scheme
was
brought
forward
in
which
the
public
worship
as
it
was
affectedly
termed
without
any
addition
of
reverence
as
if
to
give
it
the
aid
of
a
mere
code
of
formal
enactments
was
provided
for
on
the
narrowest
and
most
economical
plan
but
this
was
not
all
a
civil
constitution
was
by
the
same
code
framed
for
the
clergy
declaring
them
totally
independent
of
the
see
of
rome
and
vesting
the
choice
of
bishops
in
the
departmental
authorities
to
this
constitution
each
priest
and
prelate
was
required
to
adhere
by
a
solemn
oath
a
subsequent
decree
of
the
assembly
declared
forfeiture
of
his
benefice
against
whomsoever
should
hesitate
but
the
clergy
of
france
showed
in
that
trying
moment
that
they
knew
how
to
choose
betwixt
sinning
against
their
conscience
and
suffering
wrong
at
the
hands
of
man
their
dependence
on
the
see
of
rome
was
a
part
of
their
creed
an
article
of
their
faith
which
they
would
not
compromise
the
noble
attitude
of
firmness
and
adopted
by
prelates
and
clergymen
who
had
hitherto
been
thought
more
governed
by
levities
of
every
kind
than
by
regard
to
their
profession
commanded
for
a
time
the
respect
of
the
assembly
silenced
the
blasphemies
of
the
hired
assistants
in
the
tribunes
and
gave
many
to
fear
that
in
depriving
the
church
of
its
earthly
power
the
assembly
might
but
give
them
means
to
extend
their
spiritual
dominion
more
widely
and
awake
an
interest
in
their
fate
which
slumbered
during
their
prosperity
beware
what
you
do
said
montlosier
you
may
expel
the
bishop
from
his
episcopal
residence
but
it
will
be
only
to
open
to
him
the
cabins
of
the
poor
if
you
take
from
his
hands
the
cross
of
gold
he
will
display
a
cross
of
wood
and
it
was
by
a
cross
of
wood
that
the
world
was
saved
summoned
one
by
one
to
take
the
oath
or
refuse
it
under
the
consequences
menaced
the
assembly
fearful
of
the
effect
of
their
firmness
would
scarce
hear
these
sufferers
speak
a
syllable
save
yes
or
no
their
tumult
on
the
occasion
resembled
the
beating
of
drums
to
drown
the
last
words
of
a
martyr
few
indeed
were
the
priests
who
accepted
the
constitutional
oath
there
were
in
the
number
only
three
bishops
one
had
been
a
person
of
note
it
was
that
archbishop
of
sens
that
very
cardinal
whose
maladministration
of
fifteen
months
had
led
to
this
mighty
change
another
of
the
three
constitutional
prelates
was
destined
to
be
much
more
remarkable
it
was
the
celebrated
talleyrand
whose
talents
as
a
statesman
have
been
so
distinguished
the
national
assembly
failed
totally
in
their
attempts
to
found
a
national
church
the
priests
who
took
the
oaths
received
neither
reverence
nor
affection
and
were
only
treated
with
decency
by
such
as
considered
religion
in
the
light
of
a
useful
political
institution
they
were
alike
despised
by
the
sincere
catholic
and
the
declared
infidel
all
of
real
religious
feeling
or
devotion
that
was
left
in
france
turned
towards
their
ancient
pastors
and
though
the
impulse
was
not
strong
enough
to
counteract
the
revolutionary
movement
it
served
on
many
occasions
to
retard
and
embarrass
it
the
experiment
which
had
thus
signally
miscarried
was
indeed
as
impolitic
as
it
was
unnecessary
it
can
only
be
imputed
on
the
one
hand
to
the
fanaticism
of
the
modern
philosophers
who
expected
by
this
indirect
course
to
have
degraded
the
christian
religion
and
on
the
other
to
the
preconcerted
determination
of
the
revolutionists
that
no
consideration
should
interfere
with
the
plan
of
the
nation
through
all
its
institutions

in

to

to
exert
that
omnipotence
which
has
been
imputed
to
the
british
parliament
never
had
any
legislature
made
such
extensive
and
sweeping
changes
and
never
were
such
changes
so
easily
accomplished
the
nation
was
altered
in
all
its
relations
its
flag
and
its
emblems
were
changed
every
thing
of
a
public
character
was
destroyed
and
replaced
down
to
the
very
title
of
the
sovereign

no
longer

many
years

at
once
obliterated

were
supplied
by
a
geographical
partition
of
the
territory
into
departments
subdivided
into
six
hundred
districts
and
these
again
portioned
out
into
thousand
communities

thus
recasting

it
were
the
whole

of
the
separate

consisted

to
obliterate
former
recollections
and
distinctions
and
to
bring
every
thing
down
to
the
general
level
of
liberty
and
equality
but
it
had
an
effect
beyond
what
was
proposed
while
the
provinces
existed

had
their
separate
capitals
their
separate
privileges
and
those
capitals
though
in
a
subordinate
rank

yet
the
seats

a
separate
consequence
inferior

yet
distinct
from

when
france
became
one

province
the
importance
of
its
sole
capital

was
increased
to
a
most
formidable
degree

speedily
to
acquire

long
be
felt

alterations

of
a
more
doubtful
character

there
was
certainly
much
harshness
in
wresting

have
remembered
how
seldom
the
king
dares
to
exercise
this
right
of
mercy
in
favour

an
unpopular
criminal
it

no
small
courage
to
come
betwixt
the
dragon
and

wrath

the

the
freedom
of

doing
so
conferred
on
the
nation
a
gift
fraught
with
much
good
and
some
evil
capable
of
stimulating
the
worst
passions
and
circulating
the
most
atrocious
calumnies
and
occasioning
frequently
the
most
enormous
deeds
of
cruelty
and
injustice
but
ever
bearing
along
with
it
the
means
of
curing
the
very
evils
caused
by
its
abuses
and
of
transmitting
to
futurity
the
sentiments
of
the
good

invaluable

passions
are
silenced

obtain

stimulated
massacres
and
proscriptions
during
the
frightful
period
which
we
are
approaching
but
the
press
has
also
held
up
to
horror
the
memory
of
the
perpetrators
and
exposed
the
artifices
by
which
the
actors
were
instigated
it
is
a
rock
on
which
a
vessel
may
be
indeed
and
is
often
wrecked
but
that
same
rock
affords
the
foundation
of
the
brightest
and
noblest
beacon
we
might
add
to
the
weight
of
benefits
which
france
unquestionably
owes
to
the
constituent
assembly
that
they
restored
liberty
of
conscience
by
establishing
universal
toleration
but
against
this
benefit
must
be
set
the
violent
imposition
of
the
constitutional
oath
upon
the
catholic
clergy
which
led
afterwards

jealousy

suspicion

in

a

pageant
which
possessed
no

of

the
king

said
to
be
the
organ
of

he
had
named
but
a
small
proportion
of
the
officers
in

and

and
those
who
received
their
appointments
from
a
source
so
obnoxious
possessed
little
credit
amongst
those
whom
they
commanded
he
was
the
nominal
head
of
six
ministers
who
were
perpetually
liable
to
be
questioned
by
the
assembly
in
which
they
might
be
called
to
defend
themselves
as
criminals
but
had
no
seat
or
vote
to
enable
them
to
mingle
in

debates
this
was
perhaps
one
of
the
greatest
errors
of
the
constitution
for
the
relation
which
the
ministers
bore
to
the
legislative
body
was
of
such
a
limited
and
dependent
nature
as
excluded
all
ideas
of
confidence
and
cordiality
the
king
person
was
said
to
be
inviolable
but
the
frowning
brows
of
a
large
proportion
of
his
subjects
their
public
exclamations
and
the
pamphlets
circulated
against
him
intimated
very
different
doctrine
he
might
propose
to
the
assembly
the
question
of
peace
or
war
but
it
remained
with
them
to
decide
upon
it
lastly
the
king
had
the
privilege
of
putting
a
veto
on
any
decree
of
the
legislative
body
which
was
to
have
the
effect
of
suspending
the
passing
of
the
law
until
the
proposition
had
been
renewed
in
two
successive
assemblies
after
which
the
royal
sanction
was
held
as
granted
this
mode
of
arresting
the
progress
of
any
favourite
law
was
likely
to
be
as
dangerous
to
the
sovereign
in
its
exercise
as
the
attempt
to
stop
a
carriage
by
catching
hold
of
the
wheel
in

the
king
attempted
to
use
this
sole
relic

he
risked
his
life

it
was
by
doing
so
that
he
at
length
forfeited
it

these
mutilated
features
of
sovereignty
it
is
scarcely
worth
while
to
mention
that
the
king
effigy
was
still
struck
upon
the
public
coin
and
his
name
prefixed
to
public

small
as
was
the
share
of
public
power
which
the
new
constitution
of
france
afforded
to
the
crown
louis
in
outward
semblance
at
least
appeared
satisfied
he
made
it
a
rule
to
adopt
the
advice
of
the
assembly
on
all
occasions
and
to
sanction
every
decree
which
was
presented
to
him
he
accepted
even
that
which
totally
changed
the
constitution
of
the
gallican
church
he
considered
himself
doubtless
as
under
forcible
restraint
ever
since
he
had
been
dragged
in
triumph
from
versailles
to
paris
and
therefore
complied
with
what
was
proposed
to
him
under
the
tacit
protest
that
his
acquiescence
was
dictated
by
force
and
fear
his
palace
was
guarded
by
eight
hundred
men
with
two
pieces
of
cannon
and
although
this
display
of
force
was
doubtless
intended
by
la
fayette
to
assure
louis
personal
safety
yet
it
was
no
less
certain
that
it
was
designed
also
to
prevent
his
escape
from
the
metropolis
the
king
had
therefore
good
cause
to
conceive
himself
possessed
of
the
melancholy
privilege
of
a
prisoner
who
can
not
incur
any
legal
obligation
by
acts
which
do
not
flow
from
and
therefore
finds
a
resource
against
oppression
in
the
incapacities
which
attend
it
it
was
however
carrying
this
privilege
to
the
verge
of
dissimulation
nay
beyond
it
when
the
king
went
apparently
freely
and
voluntarily
down
to
the
national
assembly
and
in
a
dignified
and
touching
speech
could
it
have
been
thought
a
sincere
one
accepted
the
constitution
made
common
cause
with
the
regenerated
nation
and
declared
himself
the
head
of
the

constrained
as
he
was
by
circumstances
anxious
for
his
own
safety
and
that
of
his
family
the
conduct
of
louis
must
not
be
too
severely
criticised
but
this
step
was
unkingly
as
well
as
impolitic
and
the
unfortunate
monarch
gained
nothing
by
abasing
himself
to
the
deceit
which
he
practised
at
the
urgency
of
his
ministers

the
degradation

deception

regard
the

as
the
acts

royal
hypocrisy

was
openly
spoken
of
as
a
prisoner

the
public

different
forms

work
out

at
once
by
the
means
of
two
separate
agents
in
whom
alone
he
confided
the
first
was
no
other
than
mirabeau
that
very
mirabeau
who
had
contributed
so
much
to
the

who
an
aristocrat
at
heart
and
won
over
to
the
royal
party
by
high
promises
of
wealth
and
advancement
at
length
laboured
seriously
to
undo
his
own
work
his
plan
was
to
use
the
assembly
itself
in
which
his
talents
eloquence
and
audacity
gave
him
so
much
influence
as
the
means
of
the
royal
authority
he
proposed
as
the
final
measure
that
the
king
should
retire
from
paris
to
compiegne
then
under
the
government
of
the
marquis
de
bouillé
and
he
conceived
his
own
influence
in
the
assembly
to
be
such
that
he
could
have
drawn
thither
upon
some
reasonable
terms
of
accommodation
a
great
majority
of
the
members
it
is
certain
he
had
the
highest
ascendency
which
any
individual
orator
exercised
over
that
body

was

one
who
dared
to
retort
threats

is
as
much
mistaken

calls

at

full
pitch
of
his
thundering
voice
and
the
volcano
was
silent
at
his
bidding
yet
possessed
as
he
was
of
this
mighty
power
mirabeau
did
not
perhaps
reflect
how
much
less
it
would
have
availed
him
on
the
royal
side
than
when
he
sailed
with
all
the
wind
and
tide
which
the
spirit
of
a
great
and
general
revolution
could
lend
him
he
was
a
man
too
as
remarkable
for
his
profligacy
as
his
wonderful
talents
and
the
chance
which
the
king
must
have
risked
in
embarking
with
him
was
like
that
of
the
prince
in
the
tale
who
escaped
from
a
desert
island
by
embarking
on
board
a
skiff
drifting
among
dangerous
eddies
and
rowed
by
a
figure
half
human
and
half
tiger
the
experiment
was
prevented
by
the
sudden
and
violent
illness
and
death
of
mirabeau
who
fell
a
victim
to
his
debaucheries
his
death
april
was
greatly
lamented
though
it
is
probable
that
had
the
apostle
of

lived
much
longer
he
would
either
have
averted
its
progress

his
dissevered
limbs
would
have
ornamented

old
stamp

royalist
by
birth
and
disposition
had
gained
considerable
fame
during
the
american
war
and
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
was
governor
of

and
alsace
bouillé
was
endowed
with
a
rare
force
of
character
and
proved
able
without
having
recourse
to
disguise
of
any
kind
to
keep
the
garrison
of
metz
in
tolerable
discipline
during
the
general
dissolution
of

the
state
of
military
insubordination
was
so
great
that
la
fayette
and
his
party
in
the
assembly
not
only
hesitated
to
dismiss
a
general
who
was
feared
and
obeyed
by
the
regiments
under
his
command
but
royalist
as
he
was
they
found
themselves
obliged
to
employ
the
marquis
de
bouillé
and
his
troops
in
subduing
the
formidable
revolt
of
three
regiments
quartered
at

he
accomplished

complete
success

such
slaughter
among
the
insurgents
as
was
likely
to
recommend
subordination
in
future
the
republican
party
of
course
gave
this
act
of
authority
the

of
a
massacre
of
the
people

even
the
assembly
at
large

bouillé
acted
in

of

authority

with
anxiety
the
increased
importance
of
an

royalist

spared
no
pains
to
gain
him

side

avowed
publicly
that

only
retained
his
command
in
obedience
to
the
king

in
the
hope
of
serving
him
with
this
general
who
had
as
yet
preserved
an
authority
that
was
possessed
by
no
other
royalist
in
france
the
king
entered
into
a
close
though
secret
correspondence
in
cipher
which
turned
chiefly
on
the
best
mode
of
facilitating
the
escape
of
the
royal
family
from
paris

late
incidents
had
rendered
his
abode
doubly
odious
and
doubly
dangerous

strength
consisted
in
his
popularity
with
the
middle
classes
of
the
parisians
who
in
the
character
of
national
guards
looked
up
to
him
as
their
commandant
and
in
general
obeyed
his
orders
in
dispersing
those
tumultuous
assemblies
of
the
lower
orders
which
threatened
danger

fixed
in
his
principle

preserve

to
have

perpetually
trying

alarmed

theirs
arose
above

tepid

upon

those

current
falsehoods
of
the
day
arose
a
report
that
the
old
castle
of
vincennes
situated
about
three
miles
from
paris
was
to
be
used
as
a
state
prison
in
place
of
the
bastile
a
large
mob
marched
from
the
suburb
called
saint
antoine
the
residence
of
a
great
number
of
labourers
of
the
lowest
order
already
distinguished
by
its
zeal
for
the
revolutionary
doctrines
feb
they
were
about
to
commence
the
destruction
of
the
ancient
castle
when
the
vigilant
commandant
of
paris
arrived
and
dispersed
them
not
without
bloodshed
in
the
meantime
the
few
royalists
whom
paris
still
contained
became
alarmed
lest
this
tumult
though
beginning
in
another
quarter
might
be
turned
against
the
person
of
the
king
for
his
protection
about
three
hundred
gentlemen
repaired
to
the
tuileries
armed
with
sword
canes
short
swords
pistols
and
such
other
weapons
as
could
be
best
concealed
about
their
persons
as
they
went
through
the
streets
their
services
and
zeal
were
graciously
acknowledged
by
the
unfortunate
louis
little
accustomed
of
late
to
such
marks
of
devotion
but
when
la
fayette
returned
to
the
palace
at
the
head
of
his
grenadiers
of
the
national
guard
he
seems
not
to
have
been
ill
pleased
that
the
intrusion
of
these
gentlemen
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
showing
that
if
he
had
dispersed
the
revolutionary
mob
of
the
fauxbourgs
it
was
without
any
undue
degree
of
affection
to
the
royal
cause
he
felt
or
affected
extreme
jealousy
of
the
armed
aristocrats
whom
he
found
in
the
tuileries
and
treated
them
as
men
who
had
indecently
thrust
themselves
into
the
palace
to
usurp
the
duty
of
defending
the
king
person
by
law
consigned
to
the
national
guard
to
appease
the
jealousy
of
the
civic
soldiers
the
king
issued
his
commands
upon
the
royalists
to
lay
down
their
arms
he
was
no
sooner
obeyed
by
those
to
whom
alone
out
of
so
many
millions
he
could
still
issue
his
commands
than
a
most
scandalous
scene
ensued
the
soldiers
falling
upon
the
unfortunate
gentlemen
expelled
them
from
the
palace
with
blows
and
insult
applying
to
them
the
name
of
knights
of
the
poniard
afterwards
often
repeated
in
revolutionary
objurgation
the
vexation
and
sorrow
of
the
captive
prince
had
a
severe
effect
on
his
health
and
was
followed
by
indisposition
the
second
incident
we
have
alluded
to
intimated
even
more
directly
the
personal
restraint
in
which
he
was
now
held
early
in
spring
april
louis
had
expressed
his
purpose
of
going
to
saint
cloud
under
the
pretext
of
seeking
a
change
of
air
but
in
reality
it
may
be
supposed
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
what
degree
of
liberty
he
would
be
permitted
to
exercise
the
royal
carriages
were
drawn
out
and
the
king
and
queen
had
already
mounted
theirs
when
the
cries
of
the
spectators
echoed
by
those
of
the
national
guards
who
were
upon
duty
declared
that
the
king
should
not
be
permitted
to
leave
the
tuileries
la
fayette
arrived
commanded
implored
threatened
the
refractory
guards
but
was
answered
by
their
unanimous
refusal
to
obey
his
orders
after
the
scene
of
tumult
had
lasted
more
than
an
hour
and
it
had
been
clearly
proved
that
la
fayette
authority
was
unable
to
accomplish
his
purpose
the
royal
persons
returned
to
the
palace
now
their
absolute
and
avowed
prison
la
fayette
was
so
much
moved
by
this
affront
that
he
laid
down
his
commission
as
commandant
of
the
national
guard
and
although
he
resumed
it
upon
the
general
remonstrances
and
excuses
of
the
corps
it
was
not
without
severely
reproaching
them
for
their
want
of
discipline
and
intimating
justly
that
the
respect
they
showed
ought
to
be
for
his
rank
and
office
not
for
his
person
meantime
the
natural
inferences
from
these
cruel
lessons
drove
the
king
and
queen
nearly
desperate
the
events
of
the
of
february
had
shown
that
they
were
not
to
be
permitted
to
introduce
their
friends
or
defenders
within
the
fatal
walls
which
inclosed
them
those
of
the
april
proved
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
leave
their
precincts
to
fly
from
paris
to
gather
around
him
such
faithful
subjects
as
might
remain
seemed
though
a
desperate
resource
the
only
one
which
remained
to
the
unhappy
monarch
and
the
preparations
were
already
made
for
the
fatal
experiment
the
marquis
de
bouillé
had
under
various
pretences
formed
a
camp
at
montmedy
and
had
drawn
thither
some
of
the
troops
he
could
best
depend
upon
but
such
was
the
universal
indisposition
both
of
the
soldiery
and
the
people
of
every
description
that
the
general
seems
to
have
entertained
almost
no
hope
of
any
favourable
result
for
the
royal
cause
the
king
life
might
have
been
saved
by
his
escaping
into
foreign
parts
but
there
was
hardly
any
prospect
of
restoring
the
monarchy
the
history
of
the
unhappy
journey
to
varennes
is
well
known
on
the
night
between
the
and
of
june
louis
and
his
queen
with
their
two
children
attended
by
the
princess
elizabeth
and
madame
de
tourzel
and
escorted
by
three
gentlemen
of
the
gardes
du
corps
set
out
in
disguise
from
paris
the
king
left
behind
him
a
long
manifesto
inculpating
the
assembly
for
various
political
errors
and
solemnly
protesting
against
the
acts
of
government
to
which
he
had
been
compelled
as
he
stated
to
give
his
assent
during
what
he
termed
his
captivity
which
he
seemed
to
have
dated
from
his
compulsory
residence
in
the
tuileries
sidenote
escape
of
the
king
the
very
first
person
whom
the
queen
encountered
in
the
streets
was
la
fayette
himself
as
he
crossed
the
place
du
carousel
a
hundred
other
dangers
attended
the
route
of
the
unfortunate
fugitives
and
the
escapes
by
which
they
profited
seemed
to
intimate
the
favour
of
fortune
while
they
only
proved
her
mutability
an
escort
placed
for
them
at
the
pont
de
sommeville
had
been
withdrawn
after
their
remaining
at
that
place
for
a
time
had
excited
popular
suspicion
at
saint
menehould
they
met
a
small
detachment
of
dragoons
stationed
there
by
bouillé
also
for
their
escort
but
while
they
halted
to
change
horses
the
king
whose
features
were
remarkable
was
recognised
by
drouet
a
son
of
the
postmaster
the
young
man
was
a
keen
revolutionist
and
resolving
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
sovereign
he
mounted
a
horse
and
pushed
forwards
to
varennes
to
prepare
the
municipality
for
the
arrival
of
the
king
two
remarkable
chances
seemed
to
show
that
the
good
angel
of
louis
still
strove
in
his
favour
drouet
was
pursued
by
a
resolute
royalist
a
quartermaster
of
dragoons
who
suspected
his
purpose
and
followed
him
with
the
design
of
preventing
it
at
all
hazards
but
drouet
better
acquainted
with
the
road
escaped
a
pursuit
which
might
have
been
fatal
to
him
the
other
incident
was
that
drouet
for
a
time
pursued
the
road
to
verdun
instead
of
that
to
varennes
concluding
the
king
had
taken
the
former
direction
and
was
only
undeceived
by
an
accident
he
reached
varennes
and
found
a
ready
disposition
to
stop
the
flight
of
the
unhappy
prince
the
king
was
stopped
at
varennes
and
arrested
the
national
guards
were
called
out
the
dragoons
refused
to
fight
in
the
king
defence
an
escort
of
hussars
who
might
have
cut
a
passage
arrived
too
late
acted
with
reluctance
and
finally
deserted
the
town
still
there
remained
one
last
throw
for
their
freedom
if
the
time
could
have
been
protracted
but
for
an
hour
and
a
half
bouillé
would
have
been
before
varennes
at
the
head
of
such
a
body
of
faithful
and
disciplined
troops
as
might
easily
have
dispersed
the
national
militia
he
had
even
opened
a
correspondence
with
the
royal
prisoners
through
a
faithful
emissary
who
ventured
into
varennes
and
obtained
speech
of
the
king
but
could
obtain
no
answer
more
decided
than
that
being
a
prisoner
louis
declined
giving
any
orders
finally
almost
all
the
troops
of
the
marquis
de
bouillé
declared
against
the
king
and
in
favour
of
the
nation
tending
to
show
the
little
chance
which
existed
of
a
favourable
issue
to
the
king
attempt
to
create
a
royalist
force
the
marquis
himself
made
his
escape
with
difficulty
into
the
austrian
territories
the
parisians
in
general
but
especially
the
legislative
assembly
had
been
at
first
astounded
as
if
by
an
earthquake
the
king
escape
seemed
to
menace
his
instant
return
at
the
head
of
aristocratical
levies
supported
by
foreign
troops
reflection
made
most
men
see
as
a
more
probable
termination
that
the
dynasty
of
the
bourbons
could
no
longer
hold
the
crown
and
that
the
government
already
so
democratical
in
principle
must
become
a
republic
in
all
its
forms
the
constitutionalists
grieved
that
their
constitution
required
a
monarchical
head
the
republicans
rejoiced
for
it
had
long
been
their
object
to
abolish
the
kingly
office
nor
did
the
anarchists
of
the
jacobin
club
less
exult
for
the
events
which
had
taken
place
and
their
probable
consequences
were
such
as
to
animate
the
revolutionary
spirit
exasperate
the
public
mind
prevent
the
return
of
order
and
stimulate
the
evil
passions
of
lawless
ambition
and
love
of
blood
and
rapine
but
la
fayette
was
determined
not
to
relinquish
the
constitution
he
had
formed
and
in
spite
of
the
unpopularity
of
the
royal
dignity
rendered
more
so
by
this
frustrated
attempt
to
escape
he
was
resolved
to
uphold
it
and
was
joined
in
this
purpose
by
barnave
and
others
who
did
not
always
share
his
sentiments
but
who
thought
it
shame
apparently
to
show
to
the
world
that
a
constitution
framed
for
immortality
upon
the
best
political
principles
of
the
most
accomplished
statesmen
in
france
was
so
slightly
built
as
to
part
and
go
asunder
at
the
first
shock
the
purpose
of
the
commandant
of
paris
however
was
not
to
be
accomplished
without
a
victory
over
the
united
strength
of
the
republican
and
jacobinical
parties
who
on
their
part
might
be
expected
to
put
in
motion
on
the
occasion
their
revolutionary
engine
an
insurrection
of
the
people
such
was
the
state
of
political
opinions
when
the
unfortunate
louis
was
brought
back
to
paris
he
was
with
his
wife
and
children
covered
with
dust
dejected
with
sorrow
and
exhausted
with
fatigue
the
faithful
gardes
du
corps
who
had
accompanied
their
flight
sate
bound
like
felons
on
the
driving
seat
of
the
carriage
his
progress
was
at
first
silent
and
unhonoured
the
guard
did
not
present
arms
the
people
remained
covered
no
man
said
god
bless
him
at
another
part
of
the
route
a
number
of
the
rabble
precipitated
themselves
on
the
carriage
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
the
national
guards
and
some
deputies
could
assure
it
a
safe
passage
under
such
auspices
were
the
royal
family
committed
once
more
to
their
old
prison
of
the
tuileries
meantime
the
crisis
of
the
king
fate
seemed
to
be
approaching
it
was
not
long
ere
the
political
parties
had
an
opportunity
of
trying
their
respective
force
a
meeting
was
held
upon
the
motion
of
the
republican
and
jacobinical
leaders
in
the
champ
de
mars
july
to
subscribe
a
petition
for
the
dethronement
of
the
king
couched
in
the
boldest
and
broadest
terms
there
was
in
this
plain
a
wooden
edifice
raised
on
scaffolding
called
the
altar
of
the
country
which
had
been
erected
for
the
ceremony
of
the
federation
of
july
when
the
assembled
representatives
of
the
various
departments
of
france
took
their
oath
to
observe
the
constitution
on
this
altar
the
petition
was
displayed
for
signature
but
each
revolutionary
act
required
a
preliminary
libation
of
blood
and
the
victims
on
this
occasion
were
two
wretched
invalids
whom
the
rabble
found
at
breakfast
under
the
scaffolding
which
supported
the
revolutionary
altar
and
accused
of
a
design
to
blow
up
the
patriots
to
accuse
was
to
condemn
they
were
murdered
without
mercy
and
their
heads
paraded
on
pikes

and
its

was
displayed
from
the

with
a
body
of

to
skulk
in
obscurity
for
some
time
after
this
victory
of
the
champ
de
mars
which
the
jacobins
felt
severely
at
the
time
and
forgot
not
afterwards
to
avenge
most
cruelly
this
victory
led
to
the
triumph
of
the
constitutionalists
in
the
assembly
the
united
exertions
of
those
who
argued
against
the
deposition
of

founding
their
reasoning
upon

the

inviolable

person

loudly
called
on

proclaim
his
forfeiture

the
future
inviolability
of
the

penalties

he
should
order
his

the

thus
curtailed

maimed
was
now
again
presented
to

and

now
decidedly
alienated

mixed
with
some
errors
louis
whose
genuine
and
disinterested
good
intentions

to
have
made
him

historians
will
probably
be
of
opinion
that
it
was
impolitic
in
the

to
offer
the
constitutional
crown
to
louis
and
imprudent
in
that
unhappy
prince

accept
it

on

former
point
it
must
be
remembered
that
these
innovators

had
changed

thing

state
could
upon
principle
have
had
no
hesitation
to
alter
the
person

sovereign

to
the
sentiments

they
had

scarcely
possible
that
his
sentiments
could
be
altered

favour
by
the
circumstances
attending
his
unwilling
return
from

the

therefore
acting
upon
their
own
principles
should
have
at
once
proceeded
on
the
idea
that
his
flight
was
a
virtual
abdication
of
the
crown
they
should
have
made
honourable
provision
for
a
prince
placed
in
so
uncommon
a
situation
and
suffered
him
to
enjoy
in
spain
or
italy
an
honourable
independence
so
soon
as
the
storm
was
ended
which
threatened
them
from
abroad
in
the
meanwhile
the
person
of
the
king
would
have
been
a
pledge
in
their
hands
which
might
have
given
them
some
advantage
in
treating
with
the
foreign
princes
of
his
family
and
the
potentates
of
europe
in
general
the
general
policy
of
this
appears
so
obvious
that
it
was
probably
rather
the
difficulty
of
arranging
in
what
hands
the
executive
authority
should
be
lodged
than
any
preference
of
louis
which
induced
the
assembly
again
to
deposit
it
in
his
hands
shorn
in
a
great
measure
even
of
the
limited
consequence
and
privileges
constitutionally
annexed
to
it
la
fayette
and
his
party
perhaps
reckoned
on
the
king
spirit
having
given
way
from
observing
how
unanimously
the
people
of
france
were
disposed
in
favour
of
the
new
state
of
things
and
may
have
trusted
to
his
accommodating
himself
therefore
without
further
resistance
to
act
the
part
of
the
unsubstantial
pageant
which
the
constitution
assigned
him
if
it
was
impolitic
in
the
constitutionalists
to
replace
the
crown
upon
the
head
of
louis
it
was
certainly
unworthy
of
that
monarch
to
accept
it
unless
invested
with
such
a
degree
of
power
as
might
give
him
some
actual
weight
and
preponderance
in
the
system
till
his
flight
to
varennes
the
king
dislike
to
the
constitution
was
a
secret
in
his
own
bosom
which
might
indeed
be
suspected
from
circumstances
but
which
could
not
be
proved
and
which
placed
as
he
was
the
king
was
entitled
to
conceal
since
his
real
sentiments
could
not
be
avowed
consistently
with
his
personal
safety
but
now
this
veil
was
torn
aside
and
he
had
told
all
europe
in
a
public
declaration
that
he
had
been
acting
under
constraint
since
the
time
he
was
brought
in
triumph
from
versailles
to
paris
it
would
certainly
have
been
most
dignified
in
louis
to
have
stood
or
fallen
in
conformity
with
this
declaration
made
on
the
only
occasion
which
he
had
enjoyed
for
such
a
length
of
time
of
speaking
his
own
free
sentiments
he
should
not
when
brought
back
to
his
prison
have
resumed
the
submission
of
a
prisoner
or
affected
to
accept
as
a
desirable
boon
the
restoration
as
it
might
be
called
and
that
in
a
mutilated
state
of
a
sovereignty
which
he
had
voluntarily
abandoned
at
such
extreme
personal
risk
his
resolutions
were
too
flexible
and
too
much
at
the
mercy
of
circumstances
to
be
royal
or
noble
charles
even
in
the
isle
of
wight
treated
with
his
subjects
as
a
prisoner
indeed
but
still
as
a
king
refusing
to
accede
to
such
articles
as
in
his
own
mind
he
was
determined
not
to
abide
by
louis
we
conceive
should
have
returned
the
same
answer
to
the
assembly
which
he
did
to
the
royalist
officer
at
varennes
that
a
prisoner
could
give
no
orders
and
make
no
concessions
he
should
not
like
a
bird
which
has
escaped
and
been
retaken
forget
the
notes
which
he
uttered
when
at
freedom
and
return
to
his
set
and
prescribed
the
instant
that
the
cage
again
enclosed
him
no
man
above
all
no
king
should
place
the
language
of
his
feelings
and
sentiments
so
much
at
the
disposal
of
fortune
an
adherence
to
the
sentiments
expressed
in
his
voluntary
declaration
might
it
is
possible
have
afforded
him
the
means
of
making
some
more
favourable
composition
whereas
the
affectation
of
willing
submission
to
the
same
force
which
his
own
voice
had
so
lately
proclaimed
illegal
could
but
make
the
unhappy
king
suspected
of
attempting
a
deceit
by
which
no
one
could
be
deceived
but
the
difficulties
of
his
situation
were
great
and
louis
might
well
remember
the
proverb
which
places
the
grave
of
deposed
sovereigns
close
to
their
he
might
be
persuaded
to
temporize
with
the
party
which
still
offered
to
preserve
a
show
of
royalty
in
the
constitution
until
time
or
circumstances
permitted
him
to
enlarge
its
basis
in
the
meantime
if
we
can
believe
bertrand
de
moleville
louis
avowed
to
him
the
determination
to
act
under
the
constitution
with
all
sincerity
and
good
faith
but
it
must
be
owned
that
it
would
have
required
the
virtues
of
a
saint
to
have
enabled
him
to
make
good
this
pledge
had
the
success
of
the
austrians
or
any
strong
movement
tempted
him
to
renounce
it
at
all
events
the
king
was
placed
in
a
doubtful
and
suspicious
position
towards
the
people
of
france
who
must
necessarily
have
viewed
with
additional
jealousy
the
head
of
a
government
who
avowedly
discontented
with
the
share
of
power
allotted
to
him
had
nevertheless
accepted
it
like
the
impoverished
gamester

will
rather

for
small

called

dissolved
itself
agreeably
to
the

they
had
pronounced
in
the
at

the

that
structure
which
they
raised
for
immortality
soon
afterwards
became
ruinous

in

have
greater

been
assembled

were
often
fierce

sudden

these

the
faults
partly
of

partly
to

perpetually
crowding
upon
them

to
the

of

hurried
all

into

the

they
insisted

replied
that
it
was
an
unfounded
assertion
that

was
at

that
it
flowed

the

never
committed
so
great
an
error
as
in
bringing
back
the
king
from
varennes
a
fugitive
and
powerless
he
was
hastening

in

what

have
done

declared

all
which
existed

in
france
when
they
were
summoned
together
as
had
preserved
at
least
in
form
the
name
and
power
of
a
monarch
the
legislative
assembly
which
succeeded
them
seemed
preparing
to
destroy
the
symbol
of
royalty
which
their
predecessors
had
left
standing
though
surrounded
by
republican
enactments
the
composition
of
this
second
body
of
representatives
was
much
more
unfavourable
to
the
royal
cause
than
that
of
those
whom
they
succeeded
in
a
bad
hour
for
france
and
themselves
the
constituent
assembly
had
adopted
two
regulations
which
had
the
same
disabling
effect
on
their
own
political
interest
as
the
celebrated
ordinance
in
the
long
parliament
had
upon
that
of
the
presbyterians
by
the
first
of
these
decrees
the
members
of
the
constituent
assembly
were
rendered
incapable
of
being
elected
to
that
which
should
succeed
its
dissolution
by
the
second
they
were
declared
ineligible
to
be
ministers
of
the
crown
until
two
years
had
elapsed
after
their
sitting
as
legislators
those
individuals
who
had
already
acquired
some
political
knowledge
and
information
were
thus
virtually
excluded
from
the
counsels
of
the
state
and
pronounced
inadmissible
into
the
service
of
the
crown
this
exclusion
was
adopted
upon
the
wild
principle
of
levelling
which
was
one
prime
moving
spring
of
the
revolution
and
which
affected
to
destroy
even
the
natural
aristocracy
of
talents
who
are
the
whom
the
speaker
mentions
said
a
jacobin
orator
in
the
true
spirit
of
this
imaginary
equality
there
are
no
members
of
the
assembly
more
distinguished
than
others
by
talents
or
skill
any
more
than
by
birth
or
rank
we
are
all
equal
rare
words
indeed
and
flattering
doubtless
to
many
in
the
assembly
unhappily
no
legislative
decree
can
give
sense
to
folly
or
experience
to
ignorance
it
could
only
prevent
a
certain
portion
of
wisdom
and
talent
from
being
called
into
the
service
of
the
country
both
king
and
people
were
necessarily
obliged
to
put
their
confidence
in
men
of
inexperience
in
business
liable
to
act
with
all
the
rashness
by
which
inexperience
is
generally
attended
as
the
constituent
assembly
contained
the
first
and
readiest
choice
among
the
men
of
ability
whom
france
had
in
her
bosom
it
followed
that
the
second
assembly
could
not
be
equal
to
the
first
in
abundance
of
talent
but
still
the
legislative
assembly
held
in
its
ranks
many
men
of
no
ordinary
acquirements
and
a
few
of
a
corresponding
boldness
and
determination
of
character
a
slight
review
of
the
parties
into
which
it
was
divided
will
show
how
much
the
influence
of
the
crown
was
lowered
in
the
scale
sidenote
constitutionalists
there
was
no
party
remained
which
could
be
termed
strictly
or
properly
royalist
those
who
were
attached
to
the
old
monarchy
of
france
were
now
almost
all
exiles
and
there
were
left
but
few
even
of
that
second
class
of
more
moderate
and
more
reasonable
royalists
who
desired
to
establish
a
free
constitution
on
the
basis
of
an
effective
monarchy
strong
enough
to
protect
the
laws
against
license
but
not
sufficiently
predominant
to
alter
or
overthrow
them
cazalès
whose
chivalrous
defence
of
the
nobility
maury
whose
eloquent
pleadings
for
the
church
had
so
often
made
an
honourable
but
vain
struggle
against
the
advances
of
revolution
were
now
silent
and
absent
and
the
few
feeble
remnants
of
their
party
had
ranged
themselves
with
the
constitutionalists
who
were
so
far
favourers
of
monarchy
as
it
made
part
of
their
favourite
system
and
no
farther
la
fayette
continued
to
be
the
organ
of
that
party
and
had
assembled
under
his
banners
duport
barnave
lameth
all
of
whom
had
striven
to
keep
pace
with
the
headlong
spirit
of
the
revolution
but
being
outstripped
by
more
active
and
forward
champions
of
the
popular
cause
now
shifted
ground
and
formed
a
union
with
those
who
were
disposed
to
maintain
that
the
present
constitution
was
adapted
to
all
the
purposes
of
free
and
effectual
government
and
that
by
its
creation
all
farther
revolutionary
measures
were
virtually
superseded
in
stern
opposition
to
those
admirers
of
the
constitution
stood
two
bodies
of
unequal
numbers
strength
and
efficacy
of
which
the
first
was
determined
that
the
revolution
should
never
stop
until
the
downfall
of
the
monarchy
while
the
second
entertained
the
equally
resolved
purpose
of
urging
these
changes
still
farther
onwards
to
the
total
destruction
of
all
civil
order
and
the
establishment
of
a
government
in
which
terror
and
violence
should
be
the
ruling
principles
to
be
wielded
by
the
hands
of
the
demagogues
who
dared
to
nourish
a
scheme
so
nefarious
we
have
indicated
the
existence
of
both
these
parties
in
the
first
or
constituent
assembly
but
in
the
second
called
the
legislative
they
assumed
a
more
decided
form
and
appeared
united
towards
the
abolition
of
royalty
as
a
common
end
though
certain
when
it
was
attained
to
dispute
with
each
other
the
use
which
was
to
be
made
of
the
victory
in
the
words
of
shakspeare
they
were
determined
to
lay
this
angiers
even
with
the
ground
then
after
fight
who
should
be
king
of
it
the
first
of
these
parties
took
its
most
common
denomination
from
the
gironde
a
department
which
sent
most
of
its
members
to
the
convention
condorcet
dear
to
science
was
one
of
this
party
and
it
was
often
named
from
brissot
another
of
its
principal
leaders
its
most
distinguished
champions
were
men
bred
as
lawyers
in
the
south
of
france
who
had
by
mutual
flattery
and
the
habit
of
living
much
together
acquired
no
small
portion
of
that
and
overweening
opinion
of
each
other
talents
which
may
be
frequently
found
among
small
provincial
associations
for
political
or
literary
purposes
many
had
eloquence
and
most
of
them
a
high
fund
of
enthusiasm
which
a
classical
education
and
their
intimate
communication
with
each
other
where
each
idea
was
caught
up
lauded
and
enhanced
had
exalted
into
a
spirit
of
republican
zeal
they
doubtless
had
personal
ambition
but
in
general
it
seems
not
to
have
been
of
a
low
or
selfish
character
their
aims
were
often
honourable
though
visionary
and
they
marched
with
great
courage
towards
their
proposed
goal
with
the
vain
purpose
of
erecting
a
pure
republic
in
a
state
so
disturbed
as
that
of
france
and
by
hands
so
polluted
as
those
of
their
jacobin
associates
it
will
be
recorded
however
to
the
disgrace
of
their
pretensions
to
stern
republican
virtue
that
the
girondists
were
willing
to
employ
for
the
accomplishment
of
their
purpose
those
base
and
guilty
tools
which
afterwards
effected
their
own
destruction
they
were
for
using
the
revolutionary
means
of
insurrection
and
violence
until
the
republic
should
be
established
and
no
longer
or
in
the
words
of
the
satirist
for
letting
rapine
loose
and
murther
to
rage
just
so
far
but
no
further
and
setting
all
the
land
on
fire
to
burn
t
a
scantling
but
no
higher
sidenote
jacobins
the
jacobins
the
second
of
these
parties
were
allies
of
the
brissotins
with
the
ulterior
purpose
of
urging
the
revolutionary
force
to
the
uttermost
but
using
as
yet
the
shelter
of
their
republican
mantle
robespierre
who
by
an
affectation
of
a
frugal
and
sequestered
course
of
life
preserved
among
the
multitude
the
title
of
the
incorruptible
might
be
considered
as
the
head
of
the
jacobins
if
they
had
indeed
a
leader
more
than
wolves
have
which
tune
their
united
voices
to
the
cry
of
him
who
bays
the
loudest
danton
inexorable
as
robespierre
himself
but
less
prudent
because
he
loved
gold
and
pleasure
as
well
as
blood
and
power
was
next
in
authority
marat
who
loved
to
talk
of
murder
as
soldiers
do
of
battles
the
wretched
collot
a
player
chabot
an
with
many
other
men
of
desperate
character
whose
moderate
talents
were
eked
out
by
the
most
profligate
effrontery
formed
the
of
this
party
soiled
with
every
species
of
crime
and
accustomed
to
act
their
parts
in
the
management
of
those
dreadful
insurrections
which
had
at
once
promoted
and
dishonoured
the
revolution
it
is
needless
to
preserve
from
oblivion
names
such
as
santerre
and
hebert
distinguished
for
cruelty
and
villany
above
the
other
subaltern
villains
such
was
the
party
who
at
the
side
of
the
brissotins
stood
prompt
to
storm
the
last
bulwarks
of
the
monarchy
reserving
to
themselves
the
secret
determination
that
the
spoil
should
be
all
their
own
sidenote
force
of
parties
the
force
of
these
three
parties
was
as
variously
composed
as
their
principles
that
of
la
fayette
as
we
have
repeatedly
observed
lay
amongst
the
better
order
of
shopkeepers
and
citizens
and
other
proprietors
who
had
assumed
arms
for
their
own
protection
and
to
maintain
something
like
general
good
order
these
composed
the
steadiest
part
of
the
national
guard
and
generally
speaking
were
at
the
devotion
of
their
commandant
though
his
authority
was
resisted
by
them
on
some
occasions
and
seemed
daily
to
grow
more
precarious
the
royalists
might
perhaps
have
added
some
force
to
the
constitutional
party
but
la
fayette
did
not
now
possess
such
an
unsuspected
character
with
the
so
called
friends
of
freedom
as
could
permit
him
to
use
the
obnoxious
assistance
of
those
who
were
termed
its
enemies
his
high
character
as
a
military
man
still
sustained
an
importance
which
nevertheless
was
already
somewhat
on
the
wane
the
party
of
the
gironde
had
in
their
favour
the
theoretical
amateurs
of
liberty
and
equality
young
men
whose
heated
imaginations
saw
the
forum
of
ancient
rome
in
the
gardens
of
the
palais
royal
and
yielded
a
ready
assent
to
whatever
doctrine
came
recommended
by
a
flourishing
and
eloquent
peroration
and
was
rounded
off
in
a
sounding
sentence
or
a
quaint
apothegm
the
partisans
of
brissot
had
some
interest
in
the
southern
departments
which
had
sent
them
to
the
capital
and
conceived
that
they
had
a
great
deal
more
they
pretended
that
there
existed
in
those
districts
a
purer
flame
of
freedom
than
in
the
metropolis
itself
and
held
out
that
liberty
if
expelled
from
paris
would
yet
find
refuge
in
a
new
republic
to
be
founded
on
the
other
side
of
the
loire
such
did
not
escape
the
jacobins
who
carefully
treasured
them
to
be
the
apology
of
future
violence
and
finally
twisted
them
into
an
accusation
which
bestowed
on
the
brissotins
the
odious
name
of
federalists
and
charged
them
with
an
intention
to
dismember
france
by
splitting
it
into
a
league
of
petty
commonwealths
like
those
of
holland
and
switzerland
the
brissotins
had
a
point
of
union
in
the
saloon
of
madame
roland
wife
to
one
of
their
number
the
beauty
talents
courage
and
accomplishments
of
this
remarkable
woman
pushed
forward
into
public
notice
a
husband
of
very
middling
abilities
and
preserved
a
high
influence
over
the
association
of
philosophical
rhapsodists
who
hoped
to
oppose
pikes
with
syllogisms
and
to
govern
a
powerful
country
by
the
discipline
of
an
academy
the
substantial
and
dreadful
support
of
the
jacobins
lay
in
the
club
so
named
with
the
yet
more
violent
association
of
cordeliers
and
their
original
affiliated
societies
which
reigned
paramount
over
those
of
the
municipal
bodies
which
in
most
departments
were
fain
to
crouch
under
their
stern
and
sanguinary
dominion
this
club
had
more
than
once
changed
masters
for
its
principal
and
leading
feature
being
the
highest
point
of
democratical
ardour
it
drove
from
its
bosom
in
succession
those
who
fell
short
of
the
utmost
pitch
of
extravagant
zeal
for
liberty
and
equality
manifested
by
the
most
uncompromising
violence
the
word
was
as
odious
in
this
society
as
could
have
been
that
of
slavery
and
he
who
could
affect
the
most
exaggerated
and
outrageous
strain
of
patriotism
was
sure
to
outstrip
their
former
leaders
thus
the
lameths
took
the
guidance
of
the
club
out
of
the
hands
of
la
fayette
robespierre
and
marat
wrenched
the
management
from
the
lameths
and
considering
their
pitch
of
extravagant
ferocity
there
was
little
chance
of
losing
it
unless
an
avatar
of
the
evil
spirit
had
brought
satan
himself
to
dispute
the
point
in
person
the
leaders
who
were
masters
of
this
club
had
possession
as
we
have
often
remarked
of
the
to
the
passions
of
the
populace
could
raise
a
forest
of
pikes
with
one
word
and
unsheath
a
thousand
daggers
with
another
they
directly
and
openly
recommended
the
bloodiest
and
most
actions
instead
of
those
which
belonging
to
open
and
manly
warfare
present
something
that
is
generous
even
in
the
midst
of
violence
give
me
said
the
atrocious
marat
when
instructing
barbaroux
in
his
bloody
science
give
me
neapolitans
the
knife
in
their
right
hand
in
their
left
a
to
serve
for
a
target
with
these
i
will
traverse
france
and
complete
the
revolution
at
the
same
lecture
he
made
an
exact
calculation
for
the
monster
was
possessed
of
some
science
showing
in
what
manner
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
men
might
be
put
to
death
in
one
day
such
were
the
means
the
men
and
the
plans
of
the
jacobins
which
they
were
now
in
the
legislative
assembly
to
oppose
to
the
lukewarm
loyalty
of
the
constitutionalists
and
in
the
hour
of
need
to
the
republican
theories
of
the
brissotins
but
ere
we
proceed
in
our
review
of
the
internal
affairs
of
the
nation
it
becomes
now
necessary
to
glance
at
her
external
relations
hitherto
france
had
acted
alone
in
this
dreadful
tragedy
while
the
other
nations
of
europe
looked
on
in
amazement
which
now
began
to
give
place
to
a
desire
of
action
no
part
of
public
law
is
more
subtle
in
argument
than
that
which
pretends
to
define
the
exact
circumstances
in
which
according
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
one
nation
is
at
liberty
or
called
upon
to
interfere
in
the
internal
concerns
of
another
if
my
next
neighbour
house
is
on
fire
i
am
not
only
entitled
but
obliged
by
the
rules
alike
of
prudence
and
humanity
to
lend
my
aid
to
extinguish
it
or
if
a
cry
of
murder
arises
in
his
household
the
support
due
to
the
law
and
the
protection
of
the
innocent
will
excuse
my
forcible
entrance
upon
his
premises
these
are
extreme
cases
and
easily
decided
they
have
their
parallels
in
the
laws
of
nations
but
they
are
of
rare
occurrence
but
there
lies
between
them
and
the
general
maxim
prohibiting
the
interference
of
one
party
in
what
primarily
and
principally
concerns
another
a
whole
of
special
cases
in
which
it
may
be
difficult
to
pronounce
any
satisfactory
decision
in
the
history
of
nations
however
little
practical
difficulty
has
been
felt
for
wherever
the
jurisconsults
have
found
a
gordian
knot
the
sword
of
the
sovereign
has
severed
it
without
ceremony
the
doubt
has
usually
been
decided
on
the
practical
questions
what
benefit
the
neutral
power
is
like
to
derive
from
his
interference
and
whether
he
possesses
the
power
of
using
it
effectually
and
to
his
own
advantage
in
free
countries
indeed
the
public
opinion
must
be
listened
to
but
man
is
the
same
in
every
situation
and
the
same
desire
of
aggrandizement
which
induces
an
arbitrary
monarch
to
shut
his
ears
to
the
voice
of
justice
is
equally
powerful
with
senates
and
popular
assemblies
and
aggressions
have
been
as
frequently
made
by
republics
and
limited
monarchs
on
the
independence
of
their
neighbours
as
by
those
princes
who
have
no
bounds
to
their
own
royal
pleasure
the
gross
and
barefaced
injustice
of
the
partition
of
poland
had
gone
far
to
extinguish
any
remains
of
hesitation
upon
such
subjects
and
might
be
said
to
be
a
direct
recognition
of
the
right
of
the
strongest
there
would
not
therefore
have
wanted
pretexts
for
interference
in
the
affairs
of
france
of
the
nations
around
her
had
any
of
them
been
at
the
time
capable
of
benefiting
by
the
supposed
opportunity
sidenote
views
of
england
england
the
rival
of
france
might
from
the
example
of
that
country
have
exercised
a
right
of
interfering
with
her
domestic
concerns
in
requital
of
the
aid
which
she
afforded
to
the
americans
but
besides
that
the
publicity
of
the
parliamentary
debates
must
compel
the
most
ambitious
british
minister
to
maintain
at
least
an
appearance
of
respect
to
the
rights
of
other
countries
england
was
herself
much
divided
upon
the
subject
of
the
french
revolution
this
was
not
the
case
when
the
eventful
scene
first
commenced
we
believe
that
the
first
display
of
light
reason
and
rational
liberty
in
france
was
hailed
as
a
through
all
britain
and
that
there
were
few
if
any
in
that
country
who
did
not
feel
their
hearts
animated
and
enlarged
by
seeing
such
a
great
and
noble
nation
throwing
aside
the
fetters
which
at
once
restrained
and
dishonoured
them
and
assuming
the
attitude
language
and
spirit
of
a
free
people
all
men
thoughts
and
eyes
were
bent
on
struggles
which
seemed
to
promise
the
regeneration
of
a
mighty
country
and
the
british
generally
felt
as
if
days
of
old
hate
and
mutual
rivalry
would
thereafter
be
forgotten
and
that
in
future
the
similarity
of
liberal
institutions
and
the
possession
of
a
just
portion
of
rational
liberty
on
either
side
would
throw
kindness
and
cordiality
into
the
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
since
france
would
no
longer
have
ground
to
contemn
england
as
a
country
of
seditious
and
sullen
clowns
or
britain
to
despise
france
as
a
nation
of
willing
slaves
this
universal
sympathy
was
not
removed
by
the
forcible
capture
of
the
bastile
and
the
violences
of
the
people
on
that
occasion
the
name
of
that
fortress
was
so
unpopular
as
to
palliate
and
apologize
for
the
excesses
which
took
place
on
its
fall
and
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
a
people
so
long
oppressed
when
exerting
their
power
for
the
first
time
should
be
limited
by
the
strict
bounds
of
moderation
but
in
england
there
always
have
been
and
must
exist
two
parties
of
politicians
who
will
not
long
continue
to
regard
events
of
such
an
interesting
nature
with
similar
sensations
the
revolutionists
of
france
were
naturally
desirous
to
obtain
the
applause
of
the
of
freedom
and
the
societies
in
britain
which
assumed
the
character
of
the
peculiar
admirers
and
protectors
of
liberty
conceived
themselves
obliged
to
extend
their
countenance
to
the
changes
in
the
neighbouring
nation
hence
there
arose
a
great
intercourse
between
the
clubs
and
bodies
in
britain
which
assumed
the
extension
of
popular
freedom
as
the
basis
of
their
association
and
the
revolutionists
in
france
who
were
realizing
the
systems
of
philosophical
theorists
upon
the
same
ground
warm
tributes
of
applause
were
transmitted
from
several
of
these
associations
the
ambassadors
sent
to
convey
them
were
received
with
great
distinction
by
the
national
assembly
and
the
urbane
intercourse
which
took
place
on
these
occasions
led
to
exaggerated
admiration
of
the
french
system
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
thus
unexpectedly
become
the
medium
of
intercourse
between
a
great
nation
and
a
few
private
societies
the
latter
were
gradually
induced
to
form
unfavourable
comparisons
betwixt
the
temple
of
french
freedom
built
as
it
seemed
to
them
upon
the
most
perfect
principles
of
symmetry
and
uniformity
and
that
in
which
the
goddess
had
been
long
worshipped
in
england
and
which
on
the
contrast
appeared
to
them
like
an
ancient
edifice
constructed
in
barbaric
times
and
incongruously
encumbered
with
gothic
ornaments
and
emblems
which
modern
political
architects
had
discarded
but
these
political
sages
overlooked
the
important
circumstance
that
the
buttresses
which
seemed
in
some
respects
encumbrances
to
the
english
edifice
might
on
examination
be
found
to
add
to
its
stability
and
that
in
fact
they
furnished
evidence
to
show
that
the
venerable
pile
was
built
with
cement
fitted
to
endure
the
test
of
ages
while
that
of
france
constructed
of
lath
daubed
with
untempered
mortar
like
the
pageants
she
exhibited
on
the
revolutionary
festivals
was
only
calculated
to
be
the
wonder
of
a
day
the
earnest
admiration
of
either
party
of
the
state
is
sure
in
england
to
be
balanced
by
the
censure
of
the
other
and
leads
to
an
immediate
trial
of
strength
betwixt
them
the
popular
side
is
always
the
more
loud
the
more
active
the
more
imposing
of
the
two
contending
parties
it
is
formidable
from
the
body
of
talents
which
it
exhibits
for
those
ambitious
of
distinction
are
usually
friends
to
innovation
and
from
the
unanimity
and
vigour
with
which
it
can
wield
them
there
may
be
and
indeed
always
are
great
differences
in
the
point
to
which
each
leader
is
desirous
to
carry
reformation
but
they
are
unanimous
in
desiring
its
commencement
the
opposition
also
as
it
is
usually
termed
has
always
included
several
of
the
high
aristocracy
of
the
country
whose
names
ennoble
their
rank
and
whose
large
fortunes
are
a
pledge
that
they
will
for
their
own
sakes
be
a
check
upon
eager
and
violent
experimentalists
the
whigs
moreover
have
the
means
of
influencing
assemblies
of
the
lower
orders
to
whom
the
name
of
liberty
is
and
ought
to
be
dear
since
it
is
the
privilege
which
must
console
them
for
narrow
circumstances
and
inferiority
of
condition
and
these
means
the
party
so
called
often
use
successfully
always
with
industry
and
assiduity
the
counterbalance
to
this
active
and
powerful
body
is
to
be
found
speaking
generally
in
the
higher
classes
at
large
the
great
mass
of
nobility
and
gentry
the
clergy
of
the
established
church
the
superior
branches
of
the
law
the
wealthier
of
the
commercial
classes
and
the
bulk
of
those
who
have
property
to
lose
and
are
afraid
of
endangering
it
this
body
is
like
the
ban
of
the
germanic
empire
a
formidable
force
but
slow
and
diffident
in
its
operations
and
requiring
the
stimulus
of
sudden
alarm
to
call
it
into
effective
exercise
to
one
or
other
of
these
great
national
parties
every
englishman
of
education
enough
to
form
an
opinion
professes
to
belong
with
a
perfect
understanding
on
the
part
of
all
men
of
sense
and
probity
that
the
general
purpose
is
to
ballast
the
vessel
of
the
state
not
to
overset
it
and
that
it
becomes
a
in
any
one
to
follow
his
party
when
they
carry
their
doctrines
to
extremity
from
the
nature
of
this
grand
national
division
it
follows
that
the
side
which
is
most
popular
should
be
prompt
in
adopting
theories
and
eager
in
recommending
measures
of
alteration
and
improvement
it
is
by
such
measures
that
men
of
talents
rise
into
importance
and
by
such
that
the
popular
part
of
the
constitution
is
maintained
in
its
integrity
the
other
party
is
no
less
useful
by
opposing
to
each
successive
attempt
at
innovation
the
delays
of
form
the
doubts
of
experience
the
prejudices
of
rank
and
condition
legal
objections
and
the
weight
of
ancient
and
established
practice
thus
measures
of
a
doubtful
tendency
are
severely
scrutinized
in
parliament
and
if
at
length
adopted
it
is
only
when
public
opinion
has
long
declared
in
their
favour
and
when
men
minds
having
become
habituated
to
the
discussion
their
introduction
into
our
system
can
not
produce
the
violent
effect
of
absolute
novelty
if
there
were
no
whigs
our
constitution
would
fall
to
pieces
for
want
of
repair
if
there
were
no
tories
it
would
be
broken
in
the
course
of
a
succession
of
rash
and
venturous
experiments
sidenote
burke
reflections
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
whigs
of
britain
looked
with
complacence
the
tories
with
jealousy
upon
the
progress
of
the
new
principles
in
france
but
the
latter
had
a
powerful
and
unexpected
auxiliary
in
the
person
of
edmund
burke
whose
celebrated
on
the
revolution
in
had
the
most
striking
effect
on
the
public
mind
of
any
work
in
our
time
there
was
something
exaggerated
at
all
times
in
the
character
as
well
as
the
eloquence
of
that
great
man
and
upon
reading
at
this
distance
of
time
his
celebrated
composition
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
colours
he
has
used
in
painting
the
extravagances
of
the
revolution
ought
to
have
been
softened
by
considering
the
peculiar
state
of
a
country
which
long
labouring
under
despotism
is
suddenly
restored
to
the
possession
of
unembarrassed
license
on
the
other
hand
no
political
prophet
ever
viewed
futurity
with
a
surer
ken
he
knew
how
to
detect
the
secret
purpose
of
the
various
successive
tribes
of
revolutionists
and
saw
in
the
constitution
the
future
republic
in
the
republic
the
reign
of
anarchy
from
anarchy
he
predicted
military
despotism
and
from
military
despotism
last
to
be
fulfilled
and
hardest
to
be
believed
he
prophesied
the
late
but
secure
resurrection
of
the
legitimate
monarchy
above
all
when
the
cupidity
of
the
french
rulers
aspired
no
farther
than
the
forcible
possession
of
avignon
and
the
venaissin
territories
he
foretold
their
purpose
of
extending
the
empire
of
france
by
means
of
her
new
political
theories
and
under
pretext
of
propagating
the
principles
of
freedom
her
project
of
assailing
with
her
arms
the
states
whose
subjects
had
been
already
seduced
by
her
doctrines
the
work
of
burke
raised
a
thousand
enemies
to
the
french
revolution
who
had
before
looked
upon
it
with
favour
or
at
least
with
indifference
a
very
large
portion
of
the
talents
and
aristocracy
of
the
opposition
party
followed
burke
into
the
ranks
of
the
ministry
who
saw
with
pleasure
a
member
noted
for
his
zeal
in
the
cause
of
the
americans
become
an
avowed
enemy
of
the
french
revolution
and
with
equal
satisfaction
heard
him
use
arguments
which
might
in
their
own
mouths
have
assumed
an
obnoxious
and
suspicious
character
but
the
sweeping
terms
in
which
the
author
reprobated
all
attempts
at
in
which
he
had
himself
been
at
one
time
so
powerful
an
agent
subjected
him
to
the
charge
of
inconsistency
among
his
late
friends
many
of
whom
and
fox
in
particular
declared
themselves
favourable
to
the
progress
of
the
revolution
in
france
though
they
did
not
pretend
to
excuse
its
excesses
out
of
parliament
it
met
more
unlimited
applause
for
england
as
well
as
france
had
talent
impatient
of
obscurity
ardour
which
demanded
employment
ambition
which
sought
distinction
and
men
of
headlong
passions
who
expected
in
a
new
order
of
things
more
unlimited
means
of
indulging
them
the
middling
classes
were
open
in
england
as
elsewhere
though
not
perhaps
so
much
so
to
the
tempting
offer
of
increased
power
and
importance
and
the
populace
of
london
and
other
large
towns
loved
license
as
well
as
the
sans
culottes
of
france
hence
the
division
of
the
country
into
aristocrats
and
democrats
the
introduction
of
political
hatred
into
the
bosom
of
families
and
the
dissolution
of
many
a
band
of
friendship
which
had
stood
the
strain
of
a
lifetime
one
part
of
the
kingdom
looked
upon
the
other
with
the
stern
and
relentless
glance
of
keepers
who
are
restraining
madmen
while
the
others
bent
on
them
the
furious
glare
of
madmen
conspiring
revenge
on
their
keepers
from
this
period
the
progress
of
the
french
revolution
seemed
in
england
like
a
play
presented
upon
the
stage
where
two
contending
factions
divide
the
audience
and
hiss
or
applaud
as
much
from
party
spirit
as
from
real
critical
judgment
while
every
instant
increases
the
probability
that
they
will
try
the
question
by
actual
force
still
though
the
nation
was
thus
divided
on
account
of
french
politics
england
and
france
observed
the
usual
rules
of
amity
and
it
seemed
that
the
english
were
more
likely
to
wage
hostility
with
each
other
than
to
declare
war
against
france
there
was
in
other
kingdoms
and
states
upon
the
continent
the
same
diversity
of
feelings
respecting
the
revolution
which
divided
england
the
favour
of
the
lower
and
unprivileged
classes
in
germany
especially
was
the
more
fixed
upon
the
progress
of
the
french
revolution
because
they
lingered
under
the
same
incapacities
from
which
the
changes
in
france
had
delivered
the
commons
or
third
estate
of
that
country
thus
far
their
partiality
was
not
only
natural
and
innocent
but
praiseworthy
it
is
as
reasonable
for
a
man
to
desire
the
natural
liberty
from
which
he
is
unjustly
excluded
as
it
is
for
those
who
are
in
an
apartment
where
the
air
is
polluted
to
wish
for
the
wholesome
atmosphere
unhappily
these
justifiable
desires
were
connected
with
others
of
a
description
less
harmless
and
beneficial
the
french
revolution
had
proclaimed
war
on
castles
as
well
as
peace
to
cottages
its
doctrine
and
practice
held
out
the
privileged
classes
in
every
country
as
the
natural
tyrants
and
oppressors
of
the
poor
whom
it
encouraged
by
the
thousand
tongues
of
its
declaimers
to
pull
down
their
thrones
overthrow
their
altars
renounce
the
empire
of
god
above
and
of
kings
below
and
arise
like
regenerated
france
alike
from
thraldom
and
from
superstition
and
such
opinions
calling
upon
the
other
nations
of
europe
to
follow
them
in
their
democratic
career
were
not
only
trumpeted
forth
in
all
affiliated
clubs
of
the
jacobins
whose
influence
in
the
national
assembly
was
formidable
but
were
formally
recognised
by
that
body
itself
upon
an
occasion
which
but
for
the
momentous
omen
it
presented
might
have
been
considered
as
the
most
ridiculous
scene
ever
gravely
acted
before
the
legislators
of
a
great
nation
there
was
in
paris
a
native
of
prussia
an
exile
from
his
country
whose
brain
none
of
the
soundest
by
nature
seems
to
have
been
affected
by
the
progress
of
the
revolution
as
that
of
ordinary
madmen
is
said
to
be
influenced
by
the
increase
of
the
moon
this
personage
having
become
disgusted
with
his
baptismal
name
had
adopted
that
of
the
scythian
philosopher
and
uniting
it
with
his
own
teutonic
family
appellation
entitled
himself
anacharsis
clootz
orator
of
the
human
race
sidenote
feast
of
federation
it
could
hardly
be
expected
that
the
assumption
of
such
a
title
should
remain
undistinguished
by
some
supreme
act
of
folly
accordingly
the
anacharsis
set
on
foot
a
procession
which
was
intended
to
exhibit
the
representatives
of
delegates
from
all
nations
upon
earth
to
assist
at
the
feast
of
the
federation
of
the
july
by
which
the
french
nation
proposed
to
celebrate
the
revolution
in
recruiting
his
troops
the
orator
easily
picked
up
a
few
vagabonds
of
different
countries
in
paris
but
as
chaldeans
illinois
and
siberians
are
not
so
common
the
delegates
of
those
more
distant
tribes
were
chosen
among
the
rabble
of
the
city
and
subsidized
at
the
rate
of
about
twelve
francs
each
we
are
sorry
we
can
not
tell
whether
the
personage
whose
dignity
was
much
insisted
upon
as
a
miltonic
englishman
was
genuine
or
of
parisian
manufacture
if
the
last
he
must
have
been
worth
seeing
anacharsis
clootz
having
got
his
ragged
regiment
equipped
in
costume
at
the
expense
of
the
refuse
of
some
theatrical
wardrobe
conducted
them
in
solemn
procession
to
the
bar
of
the
national
assembly
presented
them
as
the
representatives
of
all
the
nations
on
earth
awakened
to
a
sense

should
be
acknowledged

oppressors
destroyed

as
well
as
in

so
far
this
absurd
scene
was
the
extravagance
of
a
mere
madman
and
if
the
assembly
had
sent
anacharsis
to
bedlam
and
his
train
to
the

it
would
have
ended
as
such
a
farce
ought
to
have
done
but
president
in

of

the
same
we
believe
who
afterwards
turned

when
in

applauded
the
zeal
of

received
the
homage
of

see
in

those
kneeling
figures
representing
conquered
nations
which
surround
the
statue
of
louis
that
from
respect
to
this
body
of
charlatans
these
figures
should
be
forthwith
demolished
this
was
done
accordingly
and
the
destruction
of
these
symbols
was
regarded
as
a
testimony
of
the
assistance

france
was
ready
to
render

require
her
assistance
for
following
in

the
scene
laughable
in
itself
became
serious
when
its
import
was
considered
and
went
far
to
persuade
the
governments
of
the
neighbouring
countries
that
the
purpose
of
france
was
to
revolutionize
europe
and
spread
the
reign
of
liberty
and
equality
over
all
the
civilized
nations
of
the

hopes
so
flattering
as
these
which
should
assign
to
the
commons

merely
freedom
from
unjust
restraints
and
disqualifications
and
that
granted
with
reserve
and
only
in
proportion
as
they
became
qualified
to
use
it
with
advantage

their
hour
of
command
and
sovereignty
with
the
privilege
of
retaliation
on
those
who
had
so
long
kept
them
in
bondage
were
sure
to
find
a
general
good
reception
among
all
to

they
were
addressed

on
the
contrary
the
fears
of
existing
governments
for
the
propagation
of
doctrines
so
seductive
in
themselves
and
which
france
seemed
apparently
prepared
to
support
with
arms
were
excited
in
an
equal
proportion
it
is
true
that
the
national
assembly
had
formally
declared
that
france
renounced
the
unphilosophical
practices
of
extending
her
limits
by
conquest
but
although
this
disavowal
spoke
to
the
ear
it
was
contradicted
by
the
annexation
of
those
desirable
possessions
the
ancient
city
of
avignon
and
the
district
called
the
comtat
venaissin
to
the
kingdom
of
france
while
the
principle
on
which
the
annexation
was
determined
on
seemed
equally
applicable
in
all
similar
cases

dispute
had
broken

for

bosom

panted
to
share
the

they
had
achieved
and
so
avignon

were
declared

in

itself

the

announced
the
interest
which
they
took
in
the
actual
condition
of
the
king

intimated
that

transferred
to

it
was
at
one

assumed
as

document
in

allowed

adapted

in

indignation
against

selfish

against

willing
to
dismember

than
submit

adverse
to

great
deal
of

load
of
unpopularity
was
transferred

supposed
to
instigate

support
in
private
the
attempts
of
his
brothers
for
engaging
foreign
courts
in
his
favour
while
the
queen
from
her
relationship
to
the
emperor

was
universally
represented
as
a
fury
urging
him
to
revenge
her
loss
of
power
on
the
rebellious
people
of

an
austrian
committee
was
talked
of
as
managing
the
correspondence
between
these
royal
persons
on
the
one
part
and
the
foreign
courts
and
emigrant
princes
on
the

this
was
totally
groundless
but
it
is
probable
and
natural
that
some
intercourse
was
maintained
between
louis
and
his
brothers
as
though
their
warlike
schemes
suited
the
king
temper
too
little
he
might
wish
to
derive
advantage
from
the

inspire
the

indeed
in
a
situation
so
disastrous
that
they
might
have
been
excused
for
soliciting
rescue
by
almost
any
means
but
in
fact
louis
and
leopold
seem
to
have
agreed
in

system

as
far
as
can
be
judged
from
the
letters

seems
always
to
point
to
a
middle
course

of
suffering
the

to
remain
such
as
it
had
been
chosen
by
the
people
and
sanctioned
by
the
national
assembly
while
the
ministers
attempted
by
the
influence
of
fear
of
dangers
from

to
prevent
any
future
assaults
upon
the
power

against

further

to
have
been
willing
to
prohibit

but
leopold
demanded
that
on
their
part
the
french

should
release
themselves
from
the
clubs
of

another
assembly
of
the
same
nature
which
pretending
to
be
no
more
than
private
associations
without
public
character
or
responsibility
nevertheless
dictated
to
the

the

in
virtue
of
the
power
of
exciting
the

movements
by

had
been
as
regularly
seconded

of

the
disposition
of

it
became
the
object
of

to
overcome
the
revolutionists
and
prevent
if
possible
the
impending
fate
of
the
royal
family
in
adopting
these
warlike
counsels
the
mind
of

much
influenced

take
the
field

of
the
royal

became
every

precarious

to
both

to
indicate
and
authorise
hostile
measures
and
they
were
at
no
pains
to
conceal
their
sentiments
it
is
not
probable
that
peace
would
have
remained
long
unbroken
unless
some
change
of
an
unexpected
and
character
in
favour

royalty
had
taken
place
in

after
all
the
menaces
which
had
been
made
by
the
foreign
powers
it
was
france
herself
who
to
the
surprise
of

first
resorted
to

the
ostensible

that

declaring

she
only
anticipated

the
commencement
of

had
menaced

each
party
in

its

which
he
patronised
to
expose
themselves
to
be
denounced
by
furious
demagogues
or
pillaged
by
the
hordes
of
robbers
and
assassins
whom
they
had
at
their
disposal
this
is
the
natural
progress
in
revolutions
while
order
continues
property
has
always
the
superior
influence
over
those
who
may
be
desirous
of
infringing
the
public
peace
but
when
law
and
order
are
in
a
great
measure
destroyed
the
wealthy
are
too
much
disposed
to
seek
in
submission
or
change
of
party
the
means
of
securing
themselves
and
their
fortunes
the
property
which
in
ordinary
times
renders
its
owners
bold
becomes
in
those
of
imminent
danger
the
cause
of
their
selfish
cowardice
la
fayette
tried
however
one
decisive
experiment
to
ascertain
what
share
remained
of
his
once
predominant
influence
over
the
parisians
he
stood
an
election
for
the
mayoralty
of
paris
against
pétion
a
person
attached
to
the
brissotin
or
republican
faction
and
the
latter
was
preferred
unsuccessful
in
this
attempt
la
fayette
became
desirous
of
foreign
war
a
soldier
and
an
approved
one
he
hoped
his
fortune
would
not
desert
him
and
that
at
the
head
of
armies
which
he
trusted
to
render
victorious
over
the
public
enemy
he
might
have
a
better
chance
of
being
listened
to
by
those
factions
who
began
to
hold
in
disrespect
the
red
flag
and
the
decaying
efforts
of
the
national
guard
of
paris
and
thus
gaining
the
power
of
once
more
enforcing
submission
to
the
constitution
which
he
had
so
large
a
share
in
creating
unquestionably
also
la
fayette
remembered
the
ardour
of
the
french
for
national
glory
and
welcomed
the
thoughts
of
shifting
the
scene
to
combat
against
a
public
and
avowed
enemy
from
his
obscure
and
unsatisfactory
struggle
with
the
clubs
of
paris
la
fayette
therefore
desired
war
and
was
followed
in
his
opinion
by
most
of
the
constitutional
party
sidenote
views
of
the
parties
the
girondists
were
not
less
eager
for
a
declaration
of
hostilities
either
the
king
must
in
that
case
place
his
veto
upon
the
measure
or
he
must
denounce
hostilities
against
his
and
his
brothers
subjecting
himself
to
all
the
suspicions
of
bad
faith
which
such
a
measure
inferred
if
the
arms
of
the
nation
were
victorious
the
risk
of
a
revolution
in
favour
of
royalty
by
insurrections
within
or
invasions
from
without
the
kingdom
was
ended
at
once
and
for
ever
and
if
the
foreigners
obtained
advantages
it
would
be
easy
to
turn
the
unpopularity
of
the
defeat
upon
the
monarch
and
upon
the
constitutionalists
who
had
insisted
and
did
still
insist
on
retaining
him
as
the
ostensible
head
of
the
executive
government
the
jacobins
those
whose
uniform
object
it
was
to
keep
the
impulse
of
forcible
and
revolutionary
measures
in
constant
action
seemed
to
be
divided
among
themselves
on
the
great
question
of
war
or
peace
robespierre
himself
struggled
in
the
club
against
the
declaration
of
hostilities
probably
because
he
wished
the
brissotins
to
take
all
the
responsibility
of
that
hazardous
measure
secure
beforehand
to
share
the
advantage
which
it
might
afford
those
republicans
against
the
king
and
constitutionalists
he
took
care
that
louis
should
profit
nothing
by
the
manner
in
which
he
pleaded
the
cause
of
justice
and
humanity
he
affected
to
prophesy
disasters
to
the
and
armies
of
france
and
cast
the
blame
beforehand
on
the
known
treachery
of
the
king
and
the
royalists
the
arbitrary
designs
of
la
fayette
and
the
constitutionalists
and
the
doubtful
patriotism
of
brissot
and
condorcet
his
arguments
retarded
though
they
could
not
stop
the
declaration
of
war
which
probably
they
were
not
intended
seriously
to
prevent
and
the
most
violent
and
sanguinary
of
men
obtained
a
temporary
character
for
love
of
humanity
by
adding
hypocrisy
to
his
other
vices
the
jacobins
in
general
notwithstanding
robespierre
remonstrances
moved
by
the
same
motives
which
operated
with
the
brissotins
declared
ultimately
in
favour
of
hostilities
the
resolution
for
war
therefore
predominated
in
the
assembly
and
two
preparatory
measures
served
as
it
were
to
sound
the
intentions
of
the
king
on
the
subject
and
to
ascertain
how
far
he
was
disposed
to
adhere
to
the
constitutional
government
which
he
had
accepted
against
those
who
in
his
name
seemed
prepared
by
force
of
arms
to
restore
the
old
system
of
monarchy
two
decrees
were
passed
against
the
emigrants
in
the
assembly
nov
the
first
was
directed
against
the
king
brother
and
summoned
xavier
stanislaus
prince
of
france
to
return
into
france
in
two
months
upon
pain
of
forfeiting
his
right
to
the
regency
the
king
consented
to
this
decree
he
could
not
indeed
dissent
from
it
with
consistency
being
as
he
had
consented
to
be
the
holder
of
the
crown
under
a
constitution
against
which
his
exiled
brother
had
publicly
declared
war
the
second
decree
denounced
death
against
all
emigrants
who
should
be
found
assembled
in
arms
on
the
of
january
next
the
right
of
a
nation
to
punish
with
extreme
pains
those
of
its
native
subjects
who
bear
arms
against
her
has
never
been
disputed
but
although
on
great
changes
of
the
state
the
vanquished
party
when
essaying
a
second
struggle
stand
in
the
relation
of
rebels
against
the
existing
government
yet
there
is
generally
wisdom
as
well
as
humanity
in
delaying
to
assert
this
right
in
its
rigour
until
such
a
period
shall
have
elapsed
as
shall
at
once
have
established
the
new
government
in
a
confirmed
state
of
possession
and
given
those
attached
to
the
old
one
time
to
forget
their
habits
and
predilections
in
its
favour
under
this
defence
louis
ventured
to
use
the
sole
constitutional
weapon
with
which
he
was
intrusted
he
refused
his
consent
to
the
decree
sensible
of
the
unpopularity
attending
this
rejection
the
king
endeavoured
to
qualify
it
by
issuing
a
severe
proclamation
against
the
emigrants
countermanding
their
proceedings
which
was
only
considered
as
an
act
of
dissimulation
and
hypocrisy
the
decree
last
proposed
jarred
necessarily
on
the
heart
and
sensibility
of
louis
the
next
affected
his
religious
scruples
the
national
assembly
had
produced
a
schism
in
the
church
by
imposing
on
the
clergy
a
constitutional
oath
inconsistent
with
their
religious
vows
the
philosophers
in
the
present
legislative
body
with
all
the
intolerance
which
they
were
in
the
habit
of
objecting
against
the
catholic
church
resolved
to
render
the
breach
irreparable
they
had
they
thought
the
opportunity
of
striking
a
death
blow
at
the
religion
of
the
state
and
they
remembered
that
the
applied
by
the
encyclopedists
to
christianity
had
been
the
proposed
decree
bore
that
such
priests
as
refused
the
constitutional
oath
should
forfeit
the
pension
allowed
them
for
subsistence
when
the
government
seized
upon
the
estates
of
the
clergy
that
they
should
be
put
into
a
state
of
surveillance
in
the
several
departments
where
they
resided
and
banished
from
france
the
instant
they
excited
any
religious
dissensions
a
prince
with
the
genuine
principles
of
philosophy
would
have
rejected
this
law
as
unjust
and
intolerant
but
louis
had
stronger
motives
to
interpose
his
constitutional
as
a
catholic
christian
whose
conscience
would
not
permit
him
to
assent
to
the
persecution
of
the
faithful
servants
of
his
church
he
refused
his
assent
to
this
decree
also
in
attempting
to
shelter
the
emigrants
and
the
recusant
churchmen
the
king
only
rendered
himself
the
more
immediate
object
of
the
popular
resentment
his
compassion
for
the
former
was
probably
mingled
with
a
secret
wish
that
the
success
of
their
arms
might
relieve
him
from
his
present
restraint
at
any
rate
it
was
a
motive
easily
imputed
and
difficult
to
be
disproved
he
was
therefore
represented
to
his
people
as
in
close
union
with
the
bands
of
exiled
frenchmen
who
menaced
the
frontiers
of
the
kingdom
and
were
about
to
accompany
the
foreign
armies
on
their
march
to
the
metropolis
the
royal
rejection
of
the
decree
against
the
orthodox
clergy
was
imputed
to
louis
superstition
and
his
desire
of
rebuilding
an
ancient
gothic
hierarchy
unworthy
of
an
enlightened
age
in
short
that
was
now
made
manifest
which
few
wise
men
had
ever
doubted
namely
that
so
soon
as
the
king
should
avail
himself
of
his
constitutional
right
in
resistance
to
the
popular
will
he
was
sure
to
incur
the
risk
of
losing
both
his
crown
and
life
meantime
this
danger
was
accelerated
by
the
consequences
of
a
dissension
in
the
royal
cabinet
it
will
scarcely
be
believed
that
situations
in
the
ministry
of
france
so
precarious
in
its
tenure
so
dangerous
in
its
possession
so
enfeebled
in
its
authority
should
have
been
even
at
this
time
the
object
of
ambition
and
that
to
possess
such
momentary
and
doubtful
eminence
men
and
wise
men
too
employed
all
the
usual
arts
of
intrigue
and
circumvention
by
which
rival
statesmen
under
settled
governments
and
in
peaceful
times
endeavour
to
undermine
and
supplant
each
other
we
have
heard
of
criminals
in
the
scottish
highlands
who
asserted
with
obstinacy
the
dignity
of
their
clans
when
the
only
test
of
was
the
priority
of
execution
we
have
read
too
of
the
fatal
raft
where
shipwrecked
men
in
the
midst
of
the
atlantic
contended
together
with
mortal
strife
for
equally
useless
preferences
but
neither
case
is
equal
in
extravagance
to
the
conduct
of
those
rivals
who
struggled
for
power
in
the
cabinet
of
louis
xvi
in
when
take
what
party
they
would
the
jealousy
of
the
assembly
and
the
far
more
fatal
proscription
of
the
jacobins
was
sure
to
be
the
reward
of
their
labours
so
however
it
was
and
the
fact
serves
to
show
that
a
day
of
power
is
more
valuable
in
the
eyes
of
ambition
than
a
lifetime
of
ease
and
safety
sidenote
change
of
ministry
de
lessart
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
already
mentioned
had
wished
to
avoid
war
and
had
fed
leopold
and
his
ministers
with
hopes
that
the
king
would
be
able
to
establish
a
constitutional
power
superior
to
that
of
the
dreadful
jacobins
the
comte
de
narbonne
on
the
other
side
being
minister
of
war
was
desirous
to
forward
the
views
of
la
fayette
who
as
we
have
said
longed
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
army
to
obtain
his
rival
disgrace
narbonne
combined
with
la
fayette
and
other
generals
to
make
public
the
opposition
which
de
lessart
and
a
majority
of
the
cabinet
ministers
had
opposed
to
the
declaration
of
hostilities
louis
justly
incensed
at
an
appeal
to
the
public
from
the
interior
of
his
own
cabinet
displaced
narbonne
the
legislative
body
immediately
fell
on
de
lessart
he
was
called
to
stand
on
his
defence
and
imprudently
laid
before
the
assembly
his
correspondence
with
kaunitz
the
austrian
minister
in
their
communications
de
lessart
and
kaunitz
had
spoken
with
respect
of
the
constitution
and
with
moderation
even
of
their
most
obnoxious
measures
but
they
had
reprobated
the
violence
of
the
jacobins
and
cordeliers
and
stigmatized
the
usurpations
of
those
clubs
over
the
constitutional
authorities
of
the
state
whom
they
openly
insulted
and
controlled
these
moderate
sentiments
formed
the
real
source
of
de
lessart
fall
he
was
attacked
on
all
sides
by
the
party
of
narbonne
and
his
friends
from
rivalry
by
brissot
and
his
followers
from
policy
and
in
order
to
remove
a
minister
too
much
of
a
royalist
for
their
purpose
by
the
jacobins
from
hatred
and
revenge
yet
when
brissot
condescended
upon
the
following
evidence
of
his
guilt
argument
and
testimony
against
him
must
have
indeed
been
scarce
de
lessart
with
the
view
of
representing
the
present
affairs
of
france
under
the
most
softened
point
of
view
to
the
emperor
had
assured
him
that
the
constitution
of
was
firmly
adhered
to
by
a
of
the
nation
hear
the
atrocious
calumniator
said
the
accuser
the
inference
is
plain
he
dares
to
insinuate
the
existence
of
a
minority
which
is
not
attached
to
the
constitution
another
accusation
which
in
like
manner
was
adopted
as
valid
by
the
acclamation
of
the
assembly
was
formed
thus
a
most
horrible
massacre
had
taken
place
during
the
tumults
which
attended
the
union
of
avignon
with
the
kingdom
of
france
vergniaud
the
friend
and
colleague
of
brissot
alleged
that
if
the
decree
of
union
had
been
early
enough
sent
to
avignon
the
dissensions
would
not
have
taken
place
and
he
charged
upon
the
unhappy
de
lessart
that
he
had
not
instantly
transmitted
the
official
intelligence
now
the
decree
of
reunion
was
as
the
orator
knew
delayed
on
account
of
the
scruples
to
accede
to
what
seemed
an
invasion
of
the
territory
of
the
church
and
at
any
rate
it
could
no
more
have
prevented
the
massacre
of
avignon
which
was
conducted
by
that
same
jourdan
called
the
bearded
man
of
the
march
to
versailles
than
the
subsequent
massacre
of
paris
perpetrated
by
similar
agents
the
orator
well
knew
this
yet
with
eloquence
as
false
as
his
logic
he
summoned
the
ghosts
of
the
murdered
from
the
glacière
in
which
their
mangled
remains
had
been
piled
to
bear
witness
against
the
minister
to
whose
culpable
neglect
they
owed
their
untimely
fate
all
the
while
he
was
imploring
for
justice
on
the
head
of
a
man
who
was
undeniably
ignorant
and
innocent
of
the
crime
vergniaud
and
his
friends
secretly
meditated
extending
the
mantle
of
safety
over
the
actual
perpetrators
of
the
massacre
by
a
decree
of
amnesty
so
that
the
whole
charge
against
de
lessart
can
only
be
termed
a
mixture
of
hypocrisy
and
cruelty
in
the
course
of
the
same
discussion
gauchon
an
orator
of
the
suburb
of
saint
antoine
in
which
lay
the
strength
of
the
jacobin
interest
had
already
pronounced
sentence
in
the
cause
at
the
very
bar
of
the
assembly
which
was
engaged
in
trying
it
royalty
may
be
struck
out
of
the
constitution
said
the
demagogue
but
the
unity
of
the
legislative
body
defies
the
touch
of
time
courtiers
ministers
kings
and
their
civil
lists
may
pass
away
but
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
the
pikes
which
enforce
it
are
perpetual
this
was
touching
the
root
of
the
matter
de
lessart
was
a
royalist
though
a
timid
and
cautious
one
and
he
was
to
be
punished
as
an
example
to
such
ministers
as
should
dare
to
attach
themselves
to
their
sovereign
and
his
personal
interest
a
decree
of
accusation
was
passed
against
him
and
he
was
sent
to
orleans
to
be
tried
before
the
high
court
there
other
royalists
of
distinction
were
committed
to
the
same
prison
and
in
the
fatal
month
of
september
were
involved
in
the
same
dreadful
fate
pétion
the
mayor
of
paris
appeared
next
day
at
the
bar
at
the
head
of
the
municipality
to
congratulate
the
assembly
on
a
great
act
of
justice
which
he
declared
resembled
one
of
those
by
which
nature
purifies
the
atmosphere
from
noxious
vapours
the
ministry
was
dissolved
by
this
severe
blow
on
one
of
the
wisest
at
least
one
of
the
most
moderate
of
its
members
narbonne
and
the
constitutional
party
who
had
espoused
his
cause
were
soon
made
sensible
that
he
or
they
were
to
gain
nothing
by
the
impeachment
to
which
their
intrigues
led
the
way
their
claims
to
share
the
spoils
of
the
displaced
ministry
were
passed
over
with
contempt
and
the
king
was
compelled
in
order
to
have
the
least
chance
of
obtaining
a
hearing
from
the
assembly
to
select
his
ministers
from
the
brissotin
or
girondist
faction
who
though
averse
to
the
existence
of
a
monarchy
and
desiring
a
republic
instead
had
still
somewhat
more
of
principle
and
morals
than
the
mere
revolutionists
and
jacobins
who
were
altogether
destitute
of
both
sidenote
war
with
austria
with
the
fall
of
de
lessart
all
chance
of
peace
vanished
as
indeed
it
had
been
gradually
disappearing
before
that
event
the
demands
of
the
austrian
court
went
now
when
fully
explained
so
far
back
upon
the
revolution
that
a
peace
negotiated
upon
such
terms
must
have
laid
france
and
all
its
various
parties
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
a
few
of
the
first
assembly
at
the
foot
of
the
sovereign
and
what
might
be
more
dangerous
at
the
mercy
of
the
restored
emigrants

establishment

agreeably

received
these

therefore
had
the

task
april

proposing

with

a
declaration
of

enthusiastically
devoted
to
their
sovereign
person
and
who
if
they
had
faults
towards

had
committed
them
in

to
him
the
proposal
was
speedily
agreed
to
by
the
assembly
for
the
constitutionalists
saw
their
best
remaining
chance
for
power
was
by
obtaining
victory
on
the
frontiers
the
girondists
had
need
of
war
as
what
must
necessarily
lead
the
way
to
an
alteration
in
the
constitution
and
the
laying
aside
the
regal
government
and
the
jacobins
whose
chief
robespierre
had
just
objected
enough
to
give
him
the
character
and
credit
of

any

it

pronounced
against

it

from

left
his
name
strongly
written

dumouriez
was
little
in
person
but
full
of
vivacity
and
talent
a
brave
soldier
having
distinguished
himself
in
the
civil
dissensions
of
poland
an
able
and
skilful
intriguer
and
to
play
a
conspicuous
part
in
times
of
public
confusion
he
has
never
been
supposed
to
possess
any
great
firmness
of
principle
whether
public
or
private
but
a
soldier
honour
and
a
soldier
frankness
together
with
the
habits
of
good
society
led
him
to
contemn
and
hate
the
sordid
treachery
cruelty
and
cynicism
of
the
jacobins
while
his
wit
and
common
sense
enabled
him
to
see
through
and
deride
the
affected
and
pedantic
fanaticism
of
republican
zeal
of
the
girondists
who
he
plainly
saw
were
amusing
themselves
with
schemes
to
which
the
country
of
france
the
age
and
the
state
of
manners
were
absolutely
opposed
thus
he
held
the
situation
of
minister
at
war
coquetting
with
all
parties
wearing
one
evening
in
the
jacobin
club
the
red
which
was
the
badge
of
breechless
freedom
and
the
next
with
better
sincerity
advising
the
king
how
he
might
avoid
the
approaching
evils
though
the
he
pointed
out
were
often
too
indirect
to
be
trodden
by
the
good
and
honest
prince
to
whom
providence
had
in
dumouriez
assigned
a
counsellor
better
fitted
to
a
less
scrupulous
sovereign
the
king
nevertheless
reposed
considerable
confidence
in
the
general
which
if
not
answered
with
all
the
devotion
of
loyalty
was
at
least
never
betrayed
the
republican
ministers
were
scarcely
qualified
by
their
talents
to
assume
the
air
of
areopagites
or
roman
tribunes
roland
by
himself
was
but
a
tiresome
pedant
and

could
not
bring
his
wife

council

attempted
to
make
her
way

the
ministerial
dinners
his
colleagues
were
of
the
same
character
and
affected
in
their
intercourse
with
the
king
a
stoical
contempt
of
the
forms
of
the
court
although
in
effect
these
are
like
other
courtesies
of
society
which
it
costs
little
to
observe
and
is
brutal
to
neglect
besides
petty
insults
of
this
sort
there
was
a
total
want
of
confidence
on
both
sides
in
the
intercourse
betwixt
them
and
the
king
if
the
ministers
were
desirous
to
penetrate
his
sentiments
on
any
particular
subject
louis
evaded
them
by
turning
the
discourse
on
matters
of
vague
and
general
import
and
did
he
on
the
other
hand
press
them
to
adopt
any
particular
measure
they
were
cold
and
reserved
and
excused
themselves
under
the
shelter
of
their
personal
responsibility
indeed
how
was
it
possible
that
confidence
could
exist
betwixt
the
king
and
his
republican
ministers
when
the
principal
object
of
the
latter
was
to
procure
the
abolition
of
the
regal
dignity
and
when
the
former
was
completely
aware
that
such
was
their
purpose
sidenote
king
guard
disbanded
the
first
step
adopted
by
the
factions
of
girondists
and
jacobins
who
moved
towards
the
same
object
side
by
side
though
not
hand
in
hand
was
to
deprive
the
king
of
a
guard
assigned
him
by
the
constitution
in
lieu
of
his
disbanded
du
it
was
indeed
of
doubtful
loyalty
being
partly
levied
from
soldiers
of
the
line
partly
from
the
citizens
and
imbued
in
many
cases
with
the
revolutionary
spirit
of
the
day
but
they
were
officered
by
persons
selected
for
their
attachment
to
the
king
and
even
their
name
of
guards
expressed
and
inspired
an
de
which
might
be
formidable
various
causes
of
suspicion
were
alleged
against
this
guard
that
they
kept
in
their
barracks
a
white
flag
which
proved
to
be
the
ornament
of
a
cake
presented
to
them
by
the
dauphin
that
their
were
formed
into
the
fashion
of
a
cock
which
announced
some
enigma
that
attempts
were
made
to
alienate
them
from
the
assembly
and
fix
their
affections
on
the
king
the
guard
contained
several
spies
who
had
taken
that
service
for
the
purpose
of
betraying
its
secrets
to
the
jacobins
three
or
four
of
these
men
produced
at
the
bar
affirmed
much
that
was
and
much
that
was
not
true
and
amid
the
causes
they
had
for
distrusting
the
king
and
their
reasons
for
desiring
to
weaken
him
the
assembly
decreed
the
reduction
of
the
constitutional
guard
the
king
was
with
difficulty
persuaded
not
to
oppose
his
and
was
thus
left
almost
totally
undefended
to
the
next
blast
of
the
revolutionary
tempest
every
successive
proceeding
of
the
factions
tended
to
show
more
strongly
that
the
storm
was
speedily
to
arise
the
invention
of
the
jacobins
exhausted
itself
in
proposing
and
adopting
revolutionary
measures
so
extravagant
that
very
shame
prevented
the
girondists
from
becoming
parties
to
them
such
was
the
carrying
the
atrocious
jourdan
in
triumph
through
the
streets
of
avignon
where
he
had
piled
eighty
carcasses
into
a
glacière
in
the
course
of
one
night
a
less
atrocious
but
no
less
insolent
proceeding
was
the
feast
given
in
honour
of
the
regiment
of
chateauvieux
whose
mutiny
had
been
put
down
at
nancy
by
de
bouillé
acting
under
the
express
decree
of
the
first
national
assembly
in
a
word
understanding
much
better
than
the
brissotins
the
taste
of
the
vulgar
for
what
was
most
violent
gross
and
exaggerated
the
jacobins
purveyed
for
them
accordingly
filled
their
ears
with
the
most
incredible
reports
and
gulled
their
eyes
by
the
most
absurd
pageants
sidenote
alarm
of
the
girondists
the
girondists
retaining
some
taste
and
some
principle
were
left
far
behind
in
the
race
of
vulgar
popularity
where
he
that
throws
off
every
mark
of
decency
bids
most
fair
to
gain
the
prize
they
beheld
with
mortification
feats
which
they
could
not
emulate
and
felt
that
their
own
assertions
of
their
attachment
to
freedom
emphatic
as
they
were
seemed
cold
and
spiritless
compared
to
the
extravagant
and
flaming
declamations
of
the
jacobins
they
regarded
with
envy
the
advantages
which
their
rivals
acquired
by
those
exaggerated
proceedings
and
were
startled
to
find
how
far
they
were
like
to
be
outstripped
by
those
uncompromising
and
unhesitating
demagogues
the
girondists
became
sensible
that
a
struggle
approached
in
which
notwithstanding
their
strength
in
the
assembly
they
must
be
vanquished
unless
they
could
raise
up
some
body
of
forces
entirely
dependent
on
themselves
to
be
opposed
in
time
of
need
to
the
jacobin
insurgents
this
was
indeed
essentially
necessary
to
their
personal
safety
and
to
the
stability
of
their
power
if
they
looked
to
the
national
guard
they
found
such
of
that
body
as
were
no
longer
attached
to
la
fayette
wearied
of
revolutions
unmoved
by
the
prospect
of
a
republic
and
only
desirous
to
protect
their
shops
and
property
if
they
turned
their
eyes
to
the
lower
orders
and
especially
the
suburbs
the
myriads
of
pikemen
which
they
could
pour
forth
were
all
devoted
to
the
jacobins
from
whom
their
leaders
received
orders
and
regular
pay
the
scheme
of
a
departmental
army
was
resorted
to
by
the
girondists
as
the
least
startling
yet
most
certain
mode
of
bringing
together
a
military
force
sufficient
to
support
the
schemes
of
the
new
administration
five
men
were
to
be
furnished
by
every
canton
in
france
which
would
produce
a
body
of
troops
to
be
armed
and
trained
under
the
walls
of
paris
this
force
was
to
serve
as
a
central
army
to
reinforce
the
soldiers
on
the
frontier
and
maintain
order
in
the
capital
as
occasion
should
demand
the
measure
proposed
by
the
girondists
was
unexpectedly
furthered
by
the
jacobins
who
plainly
saw
that
through
the
means
of
their
affiliated
societies
which
existed
in
every
canton
they
would
be
able
to
dictate
the
choice
of
so
large
a
part
of
the
departmental
army
that
when
assembled
it
should
add
to
the
power
of
their
insurrectionary
bands
at
paris
instead
of
controlling
them
the
citizens
of
paris
were
disposed
to
consider
this
concourse
of
undisciplined
troops
under
the
walls
of
the
city
as
dangerous
to
its
safety
and
an
insult
to
the
national
guard
hitherto
thought
adequate
to
the
defence
of
the
metropolis
they
petitioned
the
assembly
against
the
measure
and
even
invoked
the
king
to
reject
the
decree
when
it
should
pass
through
that
body
to
this
course
louis
was
himself
sufficiently
inclined
for
neither
he
nor
any
one
doubted
that
the
real
object
of
the
girondists
was
to
bring
together
such
an
army
as
would
enable
them
to
declare
their
beloved
republic
without
fear
of
la
fayette
even
if
he
should
find
himself
able
to
bring
the
army
which
he
commanded
to
his
own
sentiments
on
the
subject
dumouriez
warned
louis
against
following
this
course
of
direct
opposition
to
the
assembly
he
allowed
that
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
proposal
was
evident
to
every
thinking
person
but
still
its
ostensible
object
being
the
protection
of
the
country
and
capital
the
king
he
said
would
in
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
be
regarded
as
a
favourer
of
the
foreign
invasion
if
he
objected
to
a
measure
represented
as
essential
to
the
protection
of
paris
he
undertook
as
minister
of
war
that
as
fast
as
a
few
hundreds
of
the
departmental
forces
arrived
he
would
have
them
regimented
and
dismissed
to
the
frontier
where
their
assistance
was
more
necessary
than
at
home
but
all
his
remonstrances
on
this
subject
were
in
vain
louis
resolved
at
all
risks
to
place
his
on
the
measure
he
probably
relied
on
the
feelings
of
the
national
guard
of
which
one
or
two
divisions
were
much
attached
to
him
while
the
dispositions
of
the
whole
had
been
certainly
ameliorated
from
their
fear
of
fresh
confusion
by
means
of
these
new
levies
perhaps
also
the
king
could
not
bring
himself
at
once
to
trust
the
versatile
disposition
of
dumouriez
whose
fidelity
however
we
see
no
reason
for
suspecting
another
renewed
point
of
discussion
and
disagreement
betwixt
the
king
and
his
ministers
respected
the
recusant
clergy
a
decree
was
passed
in
the
assembly
that
such
priests
as
might
be
convicted
of
a
refusal
to
subscribe
the
oath
to
the
civil
constitution
should
be
liable
to
deportation
this
was
a
point
of
conscience
with
louis
and
was
probably
brought
forward
in
order
to
hasten
him
into
a
resignation
of
the
crown
he
stood
firm
accordingly
and
determined
to
oppose
his
to
this
decree
also
june
in
spite
at
once
of
all
the
arguments
which
the
worldly
prudence
of
dumouriez
could
object
and
of
the
urgency
of
the
republican
ministers
sidenote
dismissal
of
roland
etc
the
firm
refusal
of
the
king
disconcerted
the
measures
of
the
girondist
counsellors
madame
roland
undertook
to
make
the
too
scrupulous
monarch
see
the
errors
of
his
ways
and
composed
in
name
of
her
husband
and
two
of
his
colleagues
a
long
letter
to
which
dumouriez
and
the
other
two
refused
to
place
their
names
it
was
written
in
what
the
citoyenne
termed
an
austere
tone
of
truth
that
is
to
say
without
any
of
the
usual
marks
of
deference
and
respect
and
with
a
harshness
calculated
to
jar
all
the
feelings
affectionate
or
religious
of
him
whom
they
still
called
king
alas
the
severest
and
most
offensive
truths
however
late
in
reaching
the
ears
of
powerful
and
prosperous
monarchs
make
themselves
sternly
loud
to
those
princes
who
are
captive
and
unfriended
louis
might
have
replied
to
this
rude
expostulation
like
the
knight
who
received
a
blow
from
an
enemy
when
he
was
disarmed
and
a
prisoner
there
is
little
bravery
in
this
the
king
however
gave
way
to
his
resentment
as
far
as
he
could
he
dismissed
roland
servan
and
clavière
and
with
difficulty
prevailed
on
dumouriez
duranthon
and
lacoste
to
retain
their
situations
and
endeavour
to
supply
the
place
of
those
whom
he
had
deprived
of
office
but
he
was
obliged
to
purchase
their
adherence
by
ratifying
the
decree
concerning
the
federal
or
departmental
army
of
twenty
thousand
men
on
condition
that
they
should
rendezvous
at
soissons
not
at
paris
on
the
decree
against
the
priests
his
resolution
continued
unmoved
and
immovable
thus
religion
which
had
for
half
a
century
been
so
slightly
regarded
in
france
at
length
interposed
her
influence
in
deciding
the
fate
of
the
king
and
the
kingdom
the
three
discarded
ministers
affected
to
congratulate
each
other
on
being
released
from
scenes
so
uncongenial
to
their
republican
virtues
and
sentiments
as
the
of
a
court
where
men
were
forced
to
wear
buckles
instead
of
or
undergo
the
frowns
of
ushers
and
masters
of
ceremonies
and
where
patriotic
tongues
were
compelled
to
practise
and
to
address
a
being
of
the
same
flesh
and
blood
as
their
own
with
the
titles
of
sire
and
your
majesty
the
unhappy
pedants
were
not
long
in
learning
that
there
are
constraints
worse
to
undergo
than
the
etiquette
of
a
court
and
sterner
despots
to
be
found
in
the
ranks
of
a
republic
than
the
and
lenient
louis
as
soon
as
dismissed
they
posted
to
the
assembly
to
claim
the
applause
due
to
suffering
virtue
and
to
exhibit
their
letter
to
those
for
whose
ears
it
was
really
written
the
sympathizing
democrats
and
the
tribunes
they
were
accordingly
as
victims
of
their
democratic
zeal
received
with
acclamation
but
the
triumph
of
those
who
bestowed
it
was
unexpectedly
qualified
and
diminished
dumouriez
who
spoke
fluently
and
had
collected
proofs
for
such
a
moment
overwhelmed
the
assembly
by
a
charge
of
total
neglect
and
incapacity
against
roland
and
his
two
colleagues
he
spoke
of
unrecruited
armies
ungarrisoned
forts
unprovided
commissariats
in
a
tone
which
compelled
the
assembly
to
receive
his
denunciations
against
his
late
associates
in
the
ministry
but
although
his
unpleasant
and
threatening
communications
made
a
momentary
impression
on
the
assembly
almost
in
spite
of
themselves
the
wily
and
variable
orator
saw
that
he
could
only
maintain
his
ground
as
minister
by
procuring
if
possible
the
assent
of
the
king
to
the
decree
against
the
recusant
clergy
he
made
a
final
attempt
along
with
his
ephemeral
colleagues
stated
his
conviction
that
the
refusal
of
the
king
if
persisted
in
would
be
the
cause
of
insurrection
and
finally
tendered
his
resignation
in
case
their
urgent
advice
should
be
neglected
think
not
to
terrify
me
by
threats
replied
louis
my
resolution
is
fixed
dumouriez
was
not
a
man
to
perish
under
the
ruins
of
the
throne
which
he
could
not
preserve
his
resignation
was
again
tendered
and
accepted
not
without
marks
of
sensibility
on
the
part
and
his
own
and
having
thus
saved
a
part
of
his
credit
with
the
assembly
who
respected
his
talents
and
desired
to
use
them
against
the
invaders
he
departed
from
paris
to
the
frontiers
to
lead
the
van
among
the
french
victors
louis
was
now
left
to
the
pitiless
storm
of
revolution
without
the
assistance
of
any
one
who
could
in
the
least
assist
him
in
piloting
through
the
tempest
the
few
courtiers
or
much
better
named
the
few
ancient
and
attached
friends
who
remained
around
his
person
possessed
neither
talents
nor
influence
to
aid
him
they
could
but
lament
his
misfortunes
and
share
his
ruin
he
himself
expressed
a
deep
conviction
that
his
death
was
near
at
hand
yet
the
apprehension
neither
altered
his
firmness
upon
points
to
which
he
esteemed
his
conscience
was
party
nor
changed
the
general
quiet
placidity
of
his
temper
a
negotiation
to
resign
his
crown
was
perhaps
the
only
mode
which
remained
affording
even
a
chance
to
avert
his
fate
but
the
days
of
deposed
monarchs
are
seldom
long
and
no
pledge
could
have
assured
louis
that
any
terms
which
the
girondists
might
grant
would
have
been
ratified
by
their
sterner
and
uncompromising
rivals
of
the
jacobin
party
these
men
had
been
long
determined
to
make
his
body
the
step
to
their
iniquitous
power
they
affected
to
feel
for
the
cause
of
the
people
with
the
zeal
which
goes
to
slaying
they
had
heaped
upon
the
crown
and
its
unhappy
wearer
all
the
guilt
and
all
the
misfortunes
of
the
revolution
it
was
incumbent
on
them
to
show
that
they
were
serious
in
their
charge
by
rendering
louis
a
for
the
nation
on
the
whole
it
was
the
more
kingly
part
not
to
degrade
himself
by
his
own
voluntary
act
but
to
await
the
period
which
was
to
close
at
once
his
life
and
his
reign
he
named
his
last
ministry
from
the
dispirited
remnants
of
the
constitutional
party
which
still
made
a
feeble
and
unsupported
struggle
against
the
girondists
and
jacobins
in
the
assembly
they
did
not
long
enjoy
their
precarious
office
the
factions
last
named
were
now
united
in
the
purpose
of
precipitating
the
king
from
his
throne
by
actual
and
direct
force
the
voice
of
the
girondists
vergniaud
had
already
proclaimed
in
the
assembly
terror
he
said
must
in
the
name
of
the
people
burst
her
way
into
yonder
palace
whence
she
has
so
often
sallied
forth
at
the
command
of
monarchs
though
the
insurrection
was
resolved
upon
and
thus
openly
announced
each
faction
was
jealous
of
the
force
which
the
other
was
to
employ
and
apprehensive
of
the
use
which
might
be
made
of
it
against
themselves
after
the
conquest
was
obtained
but
however
suspicious
of
each
other
they
were
still
more
desirous
of
their
common
object
the
destruction
of
the
throne
and
the
erection
of
a
republic
which
the
brissotins
supposed
they
could
hold
under
their
rule
and
which
the
jacobins
were
determined
to
retain
under
their
misrule
an
insurrection
was
at
length
arranged
which
had
all
the
character
of
that
which
brought
the
king
a
prisoner
from
versailles
the
jacobins
being
the
prime
movers
of
their
desperate
followers
and
the
actors
on
both
occasions
while
the
girondists
on
the
june
hoped
like
the
constitutionalists
on
the
october
to
gain
the
advantage
of
the
enterprise
which
their
own
force
would
have
been
unable
to
accomplish
the
community
or
magistracy
of
paris
which
was
entirely
under
the
dominion
of
robespierre
danton
and
the
jacobins
had
been
long
providing
for
such
an
enterprise
and
under
pretext
that
they
were
arming
the
lower
classes
against
invasion
had
distributed
pikes
and
other
weapons
to
the
rabble
who
were
to
be
used
on
this
occasion
sidenote
the
twentieth
of
june
on
the
of
june
the
sans
culottes
of
the
suburbs
of
saint
marçeau
and
saint
antoine
assembled
together
armed
with
pikes
scythes
and
weapons
of
every
description
whether
those
actually
forged
for
the
destruction
of
mankind
or
those
which
invented
for
peaceful
purposes
are
readily
converted
by
popular
fury
into
offensive
arms
they
seemed
notwithstanding
their
great
numbers
to
act
under
authority
and
amid
their
cries
their
songs
their
dances
and
the
wild
intermixture
of
grotesque
and
fearful
revel
appeared
to
move
by
command
and
to
act
with
a
unanimity
that
gave
the
effect
of
order
to
that
which
was
in
itself
confusion
they
were
divided
into
bodies
and
had
their
leaders
standards
also
were
displayed
carefully
selected
to
express
the
character
and
purpose
of
the
wretches
who
were
assembled
under
them
one
ensign
was
a
pair
of
tattered
breeches
with
the
motto
vivent
les
sans
culottes
another
dressed
in
black
carried
on
a
long
pole
a
hog
harslet
that
is
part
of
the
entrails
of
that
animal
still
bloody
with
the
legend
la
fressure
aristocrat
this
formidable
assemblage
was
speedily
recruited
by
the
mob
of
paris
to
an
immense
multitude
whose
language
gestures
and
appearance
all
combined
to
announce
some
violent
catastrophe
the
terrified
citizens
afraid
of
general
pillage
concentrated
themselves
not
to
defend
the
king
or
protect
the
national
assembly
but
for
the
preservation
of
the
palais
royal
where
the
splendour
of
the
shops
was
most
likely
to
attract
the
cupidity
of
the
sans
culottes
a
strong
force
of
armed
citizens
guarded
all
the
avenues
to
this
temple
of
mammon
and
by
excluding
the
insurgents
from
its
precincts
showed
what
they
could
have
done
for
the
hall
of
the
legislature
or
the
palace
of
the
monarch
had
the
cause
of
either
found
favour
in
their
eyes
the
insurrection
rolled
on
to
the
hall
of
the
assembly
surrounded
the
alarmed
deputies
and
filled
with
armed
men
every
avenue
of
approach
talked
of
a
petition
which
they
meant
to
present
and
demanded
to
file
through
the
hall
to
display
the
force
by
which
it
was
supported
the
terrified
members
had
nothing
better
to
reply
than
by
a
request
that
the
insurgents
should
only
enter
the
assembly
by
a
representative
deputation
at
least
that
coming
in
a
body
they
should
leave
their
arms
behind
the
formidable
petitioners
laughed
at
both
proposals
and
poured
through
the
hall
shaking
in
triumph
their
insurrectionary
weapons
the
assembly
meanwhile
made
rather
an
ignoble
figure
and
their
attempts
to
preserve
an
outward
appearance
of
indifference
and
even
of
cordiality
towards
their
foul
and
frightful
visitants
have
been
aptly
compared
to
a
band
of
wretched
comedians
endeavouring
to
mitigate
the
resentment
of
a
brutal
and
incensed
audience
sidenote
mob
force
the
tuileries
from
the
hall
of
the
assembly
the
populace
rushed
to
the
tuileries
preparations
had
been
made
for
defence
and
several
bodies
of
troops
were
judiciously
placed
who
with
the
advantages
afforded
by
the
gates
and
walls
might
have
defended
their
posts
against
the
armed
rabble
which
approached
but
there
was
neither
union
loyalty
nor
energy
in
those
to
whom
the
defence
was
intrusted
nor
did
the
king
by
placing
himself
at
their
head
attempt
to
give
animation
to
their
courage
the
national
guards
drew
off
at
the
command
of
the
two
municipal
officers
decked
with
their
scarfs
of
office
who
charged
them
not
to
oppose
the
will
of
the
people
the
grates
were
dashed
to
pieces
with
sledge
hammers
the
gates
of
the
palace
itself
were
shut
but
the
rabble
turning
a
cannon
upon
them
compelled
entrance
and
those
apartments
of
royal
magnificence
so
long
the
pride
of
france
were
laid
open
to
the
multitude
like
those
of
troy
to
her
invaders

the
august
palace
of
the
proud
house
of
bourbon
lay
thus
exposed
to
the
rude
gaze
and
vulgar
tread
of
a
brutal
and
ferocious
rabble
who
dared
have
prophesied
such
an
event
to
the
royal
founders
of
this
stately
pile
to
the
chivalrous
henry
of
navarre
or
the
magnificent
louis
xiv
the
door
of
the
apartment
entering
into
the
vestibule
was
opened
by
the
hand
of
louis
himself
the
representative
of
this
lofty
line
he
escaped
with
difficulty
the
thrust
of
a
bayonet
made
as
the
door
was
in
the
act
of
expanding
there
were
around
him
a
handful
of
courtiers
and
a
few
of
the
grenadiers
of
the
national
guard
belonging
to
the
section
of
filles
saint
thomas
which
had
been
always
distinguished
for
fidelity
they
hurried
and
almost
forced
the
king
into
the
embrazure
of
a
window
erected
a
sort
of
barricade
in
front
with
tables
and
stood
beside
him
as
his
defenders
the
crowd
at
their
first
entrance
levelled
their
pikes
at
madame
elizabeth
whom
they
mistook
for
the
queen
why
did
you
undeceive
them
said
the
heroic
princess
to
those
around
her
it
might
have
saved
the
life
of
my
sister
even
the
insurgents
were
affected
by
this
trait
of
heroism
they
had
encountered
none
of
those
obstacles
which
chafe
such
minds
and
make
them
thirsty
of
blood
and
it
would
seem
that
their
leaders
had
not
received
decided
orders
or
having
received
them
did
not
think
the
time
served
for
their
execution
the
insurgents
defiled
through
the
apartments
and
passed
the
king
now
joined
by
the
queen
with
her
children
the
former
though
in
the
utmost
personal
danger
would
not
be
separated
from
her
husband
exclaiming
that
her
post
was
by
his
side
the
latter
were
weeping
with
terror
at
a
scene
so
horrible
the
people
seemed
moved
or
rather
their
purpose
was
deprived
of
that
energetic
unanimity
which
had
hitherto
carried
them
so
far
some
shouted
against
the
veto
some
against
the
unconstitutional
priests
some
more
modestly
called
out
for
lowering
the
price
of
bread
and
one
of
them
flung
a
red
cap
to
the
king
who
quietly
drew
it
upon
his
head
another
offered
him
a
bottle
and
commanded
him
to
drink
to
the
nation
no
glass
could
be
had
and
he
was
obliged
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle
these
incidents
are
grotesque
and
degrading
but
they
are
redeemed
by
one
of
much
dignity
fear
nothing
sire
said
one
of
the
faithful
grenadiers
of
the
national
guard
who
defended
him
the
king
took
his
hand
and
pressing
it
to
his
heart
replied
judge
yourself
if
i
fear
various
leaders
of
the
republicans
were
present
at
this
extraordinary
scene
in
the
apartments
or
in
the
garden
and
expressed
themselves
according
to
their
various
sentiments
what
a
figure
they
have
made
of
him
with
the
red
and
the
bottle
said
manuel
the
procureur
of
the
commune
of
what
a
magnificent
spectacle
said
the
artist
david
looking
out
upon
the
tumultuary
sea
of
pikes
agitated
by
fifty
thousand
hands
as
they
rose
and
sunk
welked
and
waved
tremble
tremble
tyrants
they
are
in
a
fair
train
said
the
fierce
gorsas
we
shall
soon
see
their
pikes
garnished
with
several
heads
the
crowds
who
thrust
forward
into
the
palace
and
the
presence
were
pressed
together
till
the
heat
increased
almost
to
suffocation
nor
did
there
appear
any
end
to
the
confusion
late
and
slow
the
legislative
assembly
did
at
length
send
a
deputation
of
members
headed
by
vergniaud
and
isnard
to
the
palace
their
arrival
put
an
end
to
the
tumult
for
pétion
the
mayor
of
paris
and
the
other
authorities
who
had
hitherto
been
wellnigh
passive
now
exerted
themselves
to
clear
away
the
armed
populace
from
the
palace
and
gardens
and
were
so
readily
obeyed
that
it
was
evident
similar
efforts
would
have
entirely
prevented
the
insurrection
the
poor
and
virtuous
people
as
robespierre
used
to
call
them
with
an
affected
unction
of
pronunciation
retired
for
once
with
their
pikes
unbloodied
not
a
little
marvelling
why
they
had
been
called
together
for
such
a
harmless
purpose
that
a
mine
so
formidable
should
have
exploded
without
effect
gave
some
momentary
advantages
to
the
party
at
whose
safety
it
was
aimed
men
of
worth
exclaimed
against
the
infamy
of
such
a
gratuitous
insult
to
the
crown
while
it
was
still
called
a
constitutional
authority
men
of
substance
dreaded
the
recurrence
of
such
acts
of
revolutionary
violence
and
the
commencement
of
riots
which
were
likely
to
end
in
pillage
petitions
were
presented
to
the
assembly
covered
with
the
names
of
thousands
praying
that
the
leaders
of
the
insurgents
should
be
brought
to
punishment
while
the
king
demanded
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
appeal
to
france
and
to
europe
some
satisfaction
for
his
insulted
dignity
the
violation
of
his
palace
and
the
danger
of
his
person
but
la
fayette
at
the
head
of
an
army
whose
affections
he
was
supposed
to
possess
was
the
most
formidable
intercessor
he
had
two
or
three
days
before
june
transmitted
to
the
assembly
a
letter
or
rather
a
remonstrance
in
which
speaking
in
the
name
of
the
army
as
well
as
his
own
he
expressed
the
highest
dissatisfaction
with
the
recent
events
at
paris
complaining
of
the
various
acts
of
violation
of
the
constitution
and
the
personal
disrespect
offered
to
the
king
this
letter
of
itself
had
been
accounted
an
enormous
offence
both
by
the
jacobins
and
the
girondists
but
the
tumult
of
the
of
june
roused
the
general
to
bolder
acts
of
intercession
sidenote
la
fayette
arrives
at
paris
on
the
of
the
same
month
of
june
all
parties
heard
with
as
much
interest
as
anxiety
that
general
la
fayette
was
in
paris
he
came
indeed
only
with
a
part
of
his
staff
had
he
brought
with
him
a
moderate
body
of
troops
upon
whom
he
could
have
absolutely
depended
his
presence
so
supported
in
addition
to
his
influence
in
paris
would
have
settled
the
point
at
issue
but
the
general
might
hesitate
to
diminish
the
french
army
then
in
front
of
the
enemy
and
by
doing
so
to
take
on
himself
the
responsibility
of
what
might
happen
in
his
absence
or
as
it
appeared
from
subsequent
events
he
may
not
have
dared
to
repose
the
necessary
confidence
in
any
corps
of
his
army
so
completely
had
they
been
imbued
with
the
revolutionary
spirit
still
his
arrival
thus
slightly
attended
indicated
a
confidence
in
his
own
resources
which
was
calculated
to
strike
the
opposite
party
with
anxious
apprehension
he
appeared
at
the
bar
of
the
assembly
and
addressed
the
members
in
a
strain
of
decision
which
had
not
been
lately
heard
on
the
part
of
those
who
pleaded
the
royal
cause
in
that
place
he
denounced
the
authors
of
the
violence
committed
on
the
of
june
declared
that
several
corps
of
his
army
had
addressed
him
and
that
he
came
to
express
their
horror
as
well
as
his
own
at
the
rapid
progress
of
faction
and
to
demand
that
such
measures
should
be
taken
as
to
ensure
the
defenders
of
france
that
while
they
were
shedding
their
blood
on
the
frontiers
the
constitution
for
which
they
combated
should
not
be
destroyed
by
traitors
in
the
interior
this
speech
delivered
by
a
man
of
great
courage
and
redoubted
influence
had
considerable
effect
the
girondists
indeed
proposed
to
inquire
whether
la
fayette
had
permission
from
the
minister
of
war
to
leave
the
command
of
his
army
and
sneeringly
affirmed
that
the
austrians
must
needs
have
retreated
from
the
frontier
since
the
general
of
the
french
army
had
returned
to
paris
but
a
considerable
majority
preferred
the
motion
of
the
constitutionalist
ramond
who
eulogizing
la
fayette
as
the
eldest
son
of
liberty
proposed
an
inquiry
into
the
causes
and
object
of
those
factious
proceedings
of
which
he
had
complained
thus
happily
commenced
la
fayette
daring
enterprise
but
those
by
whom
he
expected
to
be
supported
did
not
rally
around
him
to
disperse
the
jacobin
club
was
probably
his
object
but
no
sufficient
force
gathered
about
him
to
encourage
the
attempt
he
ordered
for
the
next
day
a
general
review
of
the
national
guards
in
hopes
doubtless
that
they
would
have
recognised
the
voice
which
they
had
obeyed
with
such
unanimity
of
submission
but
this
civic
force
was
by
no
means
in
the
state
in
which
he
had
left
them
at
his
departure
the
several
corps
of
grenadiers
which
were
chiefly
drawn
from
the
more
opulent
classes
had
been
under
pretence
of
the
general
principle
of
equality
melted
down
and
united
with
those
composed
of
men
of
an
inferior
description
and
who
had
a
more
decided
revolutionary
tendency
many
officers
devoted
to
la
fayette
and
the
constitution
had
been
superseded
and
the
service
was
by
studied
contumely
and
ill
usage
rendered
disgusting
to
those
who
avowed
the
same
sentiments
or
displayed
any
remaining
attachment
to
the
sovereign
by
such
means
pétion
the
mayor
of
paris
had
now
authority
enough
with
the
civic
army
to
prevent
the
review
from
taking
place
a
few
grenadiers
of
different
sections
did
indeed
muster
but
their
number
was
so
small
that
they
dispersed
in
haste
and
alarm
the
girondists
and
jacobins
closely
united
at
this
crisis
began
to
take
heart
yet
dared
not
on
their
part
venture
to
arrest
the
general
meantime
la
fayette
saw
no
other
means
of
saving
the
king
than
to
propose
his
anew
attempting
an
escape
from
paris
which
he
offered
to
further
by
every
means
in
his
power
the
plan
was
discussed
but
dismissed
in
consequence
of
the
queen
prejudices
against
la
fayette
whom
not
unnaturally
though
as
far
as
regarded
intention
certainly
unjustly
she
looked
upon
as
the
original
author
of
the
misfortunes
after
two
days
lingering
in
paris
la
fayette
found
it
necessary
to
return
to
the
army
which
he
commanded
and
leave
the
king
to
his
fate
la
fayette
conduct
on
this
occasion
may
always
be
opposed
to
any
aspersions
thrown
on
his
character
at
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
for
unquestionably
in
june
he
exposed
his
own
life
to
the
most
imminent
danger
in
order
to
protect
that
of
the
king
and
the
existence
of
royalty
yet
he
must
himself
have
felt
a
lesson
which
his
fate
may
teach
to
others
how
perilous
namely
it
is
to
set
the
example
of
violent
and
revolutionary
courses
and
what
dangerous
precedents
such
rashness
may
afford
to
those
who
use
similar
means
for
carrying
events
to
still
further
extremities

march
to
versailles
october
in
which
la
fayette
to
a
certain
degree
and
of
which
he
reaped
all
the
immediate
advantage
had
been
the
means
of
placing
louis
in
that
precarious
situation
from
which
he
was
now
so
generously
anxious
to
free
him
it
was
no
less

own
act
by
means
of
his
personal
to
bring
back
the
person
of
the
king
to
paris
from

he
was
now
recommending
and

to
further
his

measures

an
ardent
lover
of
liberty
but
she
united
with
this
passion
an
intense
feeling
of
devotion
and
a
turn
like
that
entertained
by
our
friends
the
quakers
and
other
sects
who
affect
a
transcendental
love
of
the
human
kind
and
interpret
the
doctrines
of
christian
morality
in
the
most
strict
and
literal
sense
this
person
had
sent
abroad
several
publications
recommending
to
all
citizens
of
france
and
the
deputies
especially
of
the
assembly
to
throw
aside
personal
views
and
form
a
brotherly
and
general
union
with
heart
and
hand
in
the
service
of
the
public
the
same
healing
overture
as
it
would
have
been
called
in
the
civil
dissensions
of
england
was
brought
before
the
assembly
july
and
recommended
by
the
constitutional
bishop
of
lyons
the
abbé
this
orator
affected
to
see
in
the
divisions
which
rent
the
assembly
to
pieces
only
the
result
of
an
unfortunate
error
a
mutual
misunderstanding
of
each
other
meaning
you
he
said
to
the
republican
members
are
afraid
of
an
undue
attachment
to
aristocracy
you
dread
the
introduction
of
the
english
system
of
two
chambers
into
the
constitution
you
of
the
right
hand
on
the
contrary
misconstrue
your
peaceful
and
brethren
so
far
as
to
suppose
them
capable
of
renouncing
monarchy
as
established
by
the
constitution
what
then
remains
to
extinguish
these
fatal
divisions
but
for
each
party
to
disown
the
designs
falsely
imputed
to
them
and
for
the
assembly
united
to
swear
anew
their
devotion
to
the
constitution
as
it
has
been
bequeathed
to
us
by
the
constituent
assembly
this
speech
wonderful
as
it
may
seem
had
the
effect
of
magic
the
deputies
of
every
faction
royalist
constitutionalist
girondist
jacobin
and
orleanist
rushed
into
each
other
arms
and
mixed
tears
with
the
solemn
oaths
by
which
they
renounced
the
innovations
supposed
to
be
imputed
to
them
the
king
was
sent
for
to
enjoy
this
spectacle
of
concord
so
strangely
and
so
unexpectedly
renewed
but
the
feeling
though
strong
and
it
might
be
with
many
overpowering
for
the
moment
was
but
like
oil
spilt
on
the
raging
sea
or
rather
like
a
shot
fired
across
the
waves
of
a
torrent
which
though
it
counteracts
them
by
its
momentary
impulse
can
not
for
a
second
alter
their
course
the
factions
like
le
sage
demons
detested
each
other
the
more
for
having
been
compelled
to
embrace
and
from
the
name
and
country
of
the
benevolent
bishop
the
scene
was
long
called
in
ridicule
baiser
and
réconciliation
the
next
public
ceremony
showed
how
little
party
spirit
had
been
abated
by
this
singular
scene
the
king
acceptance
of
the
constitution
was
repeated
in
the
champ
de
mars
before
the
federates
or
deputies
sent
up
to
represent
the
various
departments
of
france
and
the
figure
made
by
the
king
during
that
pageant
formed
a
striking
and
melancholy
parallel
with
his
actual
condition
in
the
state
with
hair
powdered
and
dressed
with
clothes
embroidered
in
the
ancient
surrounded
and
crowded
unceremoniously
by
men
of
the
lowest
rank
and
in
the
most
wretched
garbs
he
seemed
something
belonging
to
a
former
age
but
which
in
the
present
has
lost
its
fashion
and
value
he
was
conducted
to
the
champ
de
mars
under
a
strong
guard
and
by
a
circuitous
route
to
avoid
the
insults
of
the
multitude
who
dedicated
their
applauses
to
the
girondist
mayor
of
paris
exclaiming
pétion
or
death
when
he
ascended
the
altar
to
go
through
the
ceremonial
of
the
day
all
were
struck
with
the
resemblance
to
a
victim
led
to
sacrifice
and
the
queen
so
much
so
that
she
exclaimed
and
nearly
fainted

few
children
alone
called

le
roi
this
was
the
last
time
louis
was
seen
in
public
until
he
mounted
the
scaffold
the
departure
of
la
fayette
renewed
the
courage
of
the
girondists
and
they
proposed
a
decree
of
impeachment
against
him
in
the
assembly
but
the
spirit
which
the
general
presence
had
awakened
was
not
yet
extinguished
and
his
friends
in
the
assembly
undertook
his
defence
with
a
degree
of
unexpected
courage
which
alarmed
their
antagonists
nor
could
their
fears
be
termed
groundless
the
constitutional
general
might
march
his
army
upon
paris
or
he
might
make
some
accommodation
with
the
foreign
invaders
and
receive
assistance
from
them
to
accomplish
such
a
purpose
it
seemed
to
the
girondists
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
they
determined
not
to
trust
to
the
jacobins
to
whose
want
of
resolution
they
seem
to
have
ascribed
the
failure
of
the
insurrection
on
the
of
june
they
resolved
upon
occasion
of
the
next
effort
to
employ
some
part
of
that
departmental
force
which
was
now
approaching
paris
in
straggling
bodies
under
the
name
of
federates
the
affiliated
clubs
had
faithfully
obeyed
the
mandates
of
the
parent
society
of
the
jacobins
by
procuring
that
the
most
stanch
and
exalted
revolutionists
should
be
sent
on
this
service
these
men
or
the
greater
part
of
them
chose
to
visit
paris
rather
than
to
pass
straight
to
their
rendezvous
at
soissons
as
they
believed
themselves
the
armed
representatives
of
the
country
they
behaved
with
all
the
insolence
which
the
consciousness
of
bearing
arms
gives
to
those
who
are
unaccustomed
to
discipline
they
walked
in
large
bodies
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
and
when
any
persons
of
the
royal
family
appeared
they
insulted
the
ladies
with
obscene
language
and
indecent
songs
the
men
with
the
most
hideous
threats
the
girondists
resolved
to
frame
a
force
which
might
be
called
their
own
out
of
such
formidable
materials

barbaroux
one
of
the

of
the

a
youth
like
the
séide
of
voltaire

filled
with
the
most
devoted
enthusiasm
for
a
cause
of
which
he
never
suspected
the
truth
offered
to
bring
up
a
battalion
of
federates
from
his
native
city
of
marseilles
men
as
he
describes
them
who
knew
how
to
die
and
who
as
it
proved
understood
at
least
as
well
how
to
kill
in
raking
up
the
disgusting
history
of
mean
and
demagogues
it
is
impossible
not
to
dwell
on
the
contrast
afforded
by
the
generous
and
character
of
barbaroux
who
young
handsome
generous
and
disinterested
sacrificed
his
family
happiness
his
fortune
and
finally
his
life
to
an
enthusiastic
though
mistaken
zeal
for
the
liberty
of
his
country
he
had
become
from
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
one
of
its
greatest
champions
at
marseilles
where
it
had
been
forwarded
and
opposed
by
all
the
fervour
of
faction
influenced
by
the
southern
sun
he
had
admired
the
extravagant
writings
of
marat
and
robespierre
but
when
he
came
to
know
them
personally
he
was
disgusted
with
their
low
sentiments
and
savage
dispositions
and
went
to
worship
freedom
amongst
the
girondists
where
her
shrine
was
served
by
the
fair
and
accomplished

this
enthusiastic
leader

to
the
air
of
the
finest
hymn
to
which
liberty
or
the
revolution
had
yet
given
birth
they
appeared
in
paris
where
it
had
been
agreed
between
the
jacobins
and
the
girondists
that
the
strangers
should
be
welcomed
by
the
fraternity
of
the
suburbs
and
whatever
other
force
the
factions
could
command
thus
united
they
were
to
march
to
secure
the
municipality
occupy
the
bridges
and
principal
posts
of
the
city
with
detached
parties
while
the
main
body
should
proceed
to
form
an
encampment
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
where
the
conspirators
had
no
doubt
they
should
find
themselves
sufficiently
powerful
to
exact
the
king

or
declare
his
forfeiture
this
plan
failed
through
the
cowardice
of

chief
leader
of
the
insurgents
of
the
suburbs
who
had
engaged
to
meet
the
marseillois

promised
auxiliaries

the
undismayed
marseillois

only
about
five

in
number
marched
through
the
city
to
the
terror
of
the
inhabitants
their
keen
black
eyes
seeming
to
seek
out

victims

their

lingers
in

it
was
explained
by
a

on

attacked

meanwhile
though

and
devoted

the

failed
totally
in
their
attempt
against

in
the
assembly
the
decree
of
accusation
against
him
being
rejected
by

they
were
therefore

resort
to
measures
of
direct
violence
which
unquestionably
they
would
willingly
have
abstained
from
since
they
could
not

them
without
giving
a
perilous
superiority

of
the
duke
of
brunswick
and
his
arrival
on
the
french
frontier
at
the
head
of
a
powerful
prussian
army
acted
upon
the
other
motives
for

as
a
high
pressure
upon

producing
explosion
it

misfortune

often
noticed
to
be
as
frequently
injured
by
the
erroneous
measures
of
his
friends
as
by

machinations
of
his
enemies
and
this
proclamation
issued
july
by
a
monarch
who
had
taken
arms
in
the
king
cause
was
couched
in
language
intolerable
to
the
feelings
even
of
such
frenchmen
as
might
still
retain
towards
their
king

sentiments
of
loyalty
all

denounced
as

the
duke
of
brunswick
was
undoubtedly
induced
to
assume
this
tone
by
the
ease
which
he
had
experienced
in
putting
down
the
revolution
in
holland
but
the
cases
were
by
no
means
parallel
holland
was
a
country
much
divided
in
political
opinions
and
there
was
existing
among
the
constituted
authorities
a
strong
party
in
favour
of
the
stadtholder

on

contrary

though
divided
into
many
bitter
factions

itself
above
all
the
comparative
strength
of
france
and
holland
was
so
different
that
a
force
which
might
overthrow
the
one
country
without
almost
a
struggle
would
scarce
prove
sufficient
to
wrest
from
such
a
nation
as
france
even
the
most
petty
of
her
frontier
fortresses
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
this
haughty
and
insolent
language
on
the
part
of
the
invaders
irritated
the
personal
feelings
of
every
true
frenchman
and
determined
them
to
the
most
obstinate
resistance
against
invaders
who
were
confident
enough
to
treat
them
as
a
conquered
people
even
before
a
skirmish
had
been
fought
the
imprudence
of
the
allied
general
recoiled
on
the
unfortunate
louis

account
he
used
this
menacing

began
to
consider

cause
as
identified
with
that
of
the

of
course
as
standing
in
diametrical
opposition
to
that
of
the
country
and
these
opinions
spread
generally
among
the
citizens
of
paris
to
animate
the
citizens
to
their
defence
the
assembly
declared
that
the
country
was
in
danger
and
in
order
that
the
annunciation
might
be
more
impressive

were
hourly
discharged
from

of
military

the
streets

of

were
drawn
together
hastily
as
if
the
enemy
were
at
the
gates

all
the
hurried
and
hasty
movements
of
the
constituted
authorities
seemed
to
announce
that
the
invaders
were
within
a
day
march
of
paris
these
distracting
and
alarming
movements
with
the
sentiments
of
fear
and
anxiety
which
they
were
qualified
to
inspire
aggravated
the
unpopularity
of
louis
in
whose
cause
his
brothers
and
his
allies
were
now
threatening
the
metropolis
of
france
from
these
concurring
circumstances
the
public
voice
was
indeed
so
strongly
against
the
cause
of
monarchy
that
the
girondists
ventured
by
their
organ
vergniaud
to
accuse
the
king
in
the
assembly
of
holding
intelligence
with
the
enemy
or
at
least
of
omitting
sufficient
defensive
preparations
and
proposed
in
express
terms
that
they
should
proceed
to
declare
his
forfeiture
the
orator
however
did
not
press
this
motion
willing
doubtless
that
the
power
of
carrying
through
and
enforcing
such
a
decree
should
be
completely
ascertained
which
could
only
be
after
a
mortal
struggle
with
the
last
defenders
of
the
crown
but
when
a
motion
like
this
could
be
made
and
seconded
it
showed
plainly
how
little
respect
was
preserved
for
the
king
in
the
assembly
at
large
for
this
struggle
all
parties
were
arranging
their
forces
and
it
became
every
hour
more
evident
that
the
capital
was
speedily
to
be

the

been
fixed
by

was
apprised

thousand

tenth

early
on
the
morning
of
the
of

the
tocsin
rung
out
its
over
the
terrified
city
of
paris
and
announced
that
the
insurrection
was
at
length
on
foot
in
many
parishes
the
constitutional
party
resisted
those
who
came
to
sound
this
awful
signal
but
the
jacobins
were
found
every
where
victorious
and
the
prolonged
mournful
sound
was
soon
tolled
out
from
every
steeple
in
the
metropolis
to
this
melancholy
music
the
contending
parties
arranged
their
forces
for
attack
and
defence
upon
a
day
which
was
doomed
to
be
decisive
the
swiss
guards
got
under
arms
and
repaired
to
their
posts
in
and
around
the
palace
about
four
hundred
grenadiers
of
the
loyal
section
of
filles
saint
thomas
joined
by
several
from
that
of
les
petits
pères
in
whom
all
confidence
could
justly
be
reposed
were
posted
in
the
interior
of
the
palace
and
associated
with
the
swiss
for
its
defence
the
relics
of
the
royalist
party
undismayed
at
the
events
of
the
of
february
in
the
year
preceding
had
repaired
to
the
palace
on
the
first
signal
given
by
the
tocsin
joined
to
the
domestic
attendants
of
the
royal
family
they
might
amount
to
about
four
hundred
persons
nothing
can
more
strongly
mark
the
unprepared
state
of
the
court
than
that
there
were
neither
muskets
nor
bayonets
for
suitably
arming
these
volunteers
nor
any
supply
of
ammunition
save
what
the
swiss
and
national
grenadiers
had
in
their
pouches
the
appearance
also
of
this
little
troop
tended
to
inspire
dismay
rather
than
confidence
the
chivalrous
cry
of
entrance
for
the
noblesse
of
france
was
the
signal
for
their
filing
into
the
presence
of
the
royal
family
alas
instead
of
the
thousand
nobles
whose
swords
used
to
gleam
around
their
monarch
at
such
a
crisis
there
entered
but
veteran
officers
of
rank
whose
strength
though
not
their
spirit
was
consumed
by
years
mixed
with
boys
scarce
beyond
the
age
of
children
and
with
men
of
civil
professions
several
of
whom
lamoignon
malesherbes
for
example
had
now
for
the
first
time
worn
a
sword
their
arms
were
as
miscellaneous
as
their
appearance
rapiers
hangers
and
pistols
were
the
weapons
with
which
they
were
to
encounter
bands
well
provided
with
musketry
and
artillery
their
courage
however
was
unabated
it
was
in
vain
that
the
queen
conjured
almost
with
tears
men
aged
fourscore
and
upwards
to
retire
from
a
contest
where
their
strength
could
avail
so
little
the
veterans
felt
that
the
fatal
hour
was
come
and
unable
to
fight
claimed
the
privilege
of
dying
in
the
discharge
of
their
duty
the
behaviour
of
marie
antoinette
was
magnanimous
in
the
highest
degree
her
majestic
air
says
peltier
her
austrian
lip
and
aquiline
nose
gave
her
an
air
of
dignity
which
can
only
be
conceived
by
those
who
beheld
her
in
that
trying
hour
could
she
have
inspired
the
king
with
some
portion
of
her
active
spirit
he
might
even
at
that
extreme
hour
have
wrested
the
victory
from
the
revolutionists
but
the
misfortunes
which
he
could
endure
like
a
saint
he
could
not
face
and
combat
like
a
hero
and
his
scruples
about
shedding
human
blood
wellnigh
unmanned
him
the
distant
shouts
of
the
enemy
were
already
heard
while
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
were
filled
by
the
successive
legions
of
the
national
guard
with
their
cannon
of
this
civic
force
some
and
especially
the
artillerymen
were
as
towards
the
king
as
was
possible
others
were
well
inclined
to
him
and
the
greater
part
remained
doubtful

commander
was
entirely

the
best
advantage

discouraging
the
mutinous
and
giving
confidence
to
the
when
he
received
an
order
to
repair
to
the
municipality
for
orders
he
went
thither
accordingly
expecting
the
support
of
such
constitutionalists
as
remained
in
that
magistracy
but
he
found
it
entirely
in
possession
of
the
jacobin
party

to

the
brissotin
mayor

him

it

a
message
was
despatched
accordingly
requiring

attendance

the
weakness
to
permit

was
to
lie
on

advised

review

dejected

testimony

placed
himself
at

would

and
represented
the
state
of
the
city
and
of
the
palace
conjuring
the
assembly
to
send
a
deputation
to
prevent
bloodshed
this
was
courageous
on
the
part
of
those
faithful
servants
for
to
intimate
the
least
interest
in
the
king
fate
was
like
the
bold
swimmer
who
approaches
the
whirlpool

successful

consisted

the
most
unfriendly
to

movement

attacked
began

his
own
safety
was
compromised
by
this
implied
grant
of
permission

use

person
he
became
urgent
with
the
king
to
retire
from
the
palace
and
put
himself
under
the
protection
of
the
national
assembly
the
queen
felt
at
once
all
the
imbecility
and
dishonour
of
throwing
themselves
as
suppliants
on
the
protection
of
a
body
which
had
not
shown
even
a
shadow
of
interest
in

safety
surrounded
as
they
knew
the
royal
family
to
be
with
the
most
inveterate
enemies
ere
she
consented
to
such
infamy
she
said
she
would
willingly
be
nailed
to
the
walls
of
the
palace
but
the
counsel
which
promised
to
avert
the
necessity
of
bloodshed
on
either
part
suited
well
with
the
timorous
conscience
and
irresolution
of
louis
other
measures
were
hastily
proposed
by
those
who
had
devoted
themselves
to
secure
his
safety
there
was
however
no
real
alternative
but
to
fight
at
the
head
of
his
guards
or
to
submit
himself
to
the
pleasure
of
the
assembly
and
louis
preferred
the
latter
his
wife
his
sister
and
his
children
accompanied
him
on
this
occasion
and
the
utmost
efforts
of
an
escort
of
three
hundred
swiss
and
national
grenadiers
were
scarce
able
to
protect
them
and
a
small
retinue
consisting
of
the
ministers
and
a
few
men
of
rank
the
gleanings
of
the
most
brilliant
court
of
christendom
who
accompanied
their
master
in
this
last
act
of
humiliation
which
was
indeed
equal
to
a
voluntary
descent
from
his
throne
they
were
at
every
moment
of
their
progress
interrupted
by
the
deadliest
threats
and
imprecations
and
the
weapons
of
more
than
one
ruffian
were
levelled
against
them
the
queen
was
robbed
even
of
her
watch
and
purse
so
near
might
the
worst
criminals
approach
the
persons
of
the
royal
fugitives
louis
showed
the
greatest
composure
amidst
all
these
imminent
dangers
he
was
feeble
when
called
upon
to
kill
but
strong
in
resolution
when
the
question
was
only
to
die
the

he
said

the
commission
of
a
great
crime
vergniaud
who
was
president
at
the
time
answered
with
propriety
though
ambiguously
he
assured
the
king
that
the
assembly
knew
its
duties
and
was
ready
to
perish
in
support
of
them
a
member
of
the
mountain
observed
with
bitter
irony
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
assembly
to
deliberate
freely
in
presence
of
the
monarch
and
proposed
he
should
retreat
into
one
of
the
most
remote
committee
rooms
a
place
where
assassination
must
have
been
comparatively
easy
the
assembly
rejected
this
proposal
alike
insulting
and
insidious
and
assigned
a
box
or
small
apartment
called
the
logographe
used
for
the
reporters
of
the
debates
for
the
place
of
refuge
of
this
unhappy
family
this
arrangement
was
scarce
made
ere
a
heavy
discharge
of
musketry
and
cannon
announced
that
the
king
retreat
had
not
prevented
the
bloodshed
he
so
greatly
feared
it
must
be
supposed
to
have
been
louis
intention
that
his
guards
and
defenders
should
draw
off
from
the
palace
as
soon
as
he
himself
had
abandoned
it
for
to
what
purpose
was
it
now
to
be
defended
when
the
royal
family
were
no
longer
concerned
and
at
what
risk
when
the
garrison
was
diminished
by
three
hundred
of
the
best
of
the
troops
selected
as
the
royal
escort
but
no
such
order
of
retreat
or
of
had
in
fact
been
issued
to
the
swiss
guards
and
the
military
discipline
of
this
fine
corps
prevented
their
retiring
from
an
assigned
post
without
command
captain
durler
is
said
to
have
asked
the
maréchal
mailly
for
orders
and
to
have
received
for
answer
do
not
suffer
your
posts
to
be
forced
you
may
rely
on
it
replied
the
intrepid
swiss
meantime
to
give
no
unnecessary
provocation
as
well
as
on
account
of
their
diminished
numbers
the
court
in
front
of
the
palace
was
abandoned
and
the
guards
were
withdrawn
into
the
building
itself
their
outermost
sentinels
being
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
splendid
staircase
to
defend
a
sort
of
barricade
which
had
been
erected
there
ever
since
the
june
to
prevent
such
intrusions
as
distinguished
that
day

to
the
outposts
of

swiss
they
had
already
tasted
blood
that
day
having
massacred
a
patrol
of
royalists
who
unable
to
get
into
the
tuileries
had
attempted
to
assist
the
defence
by
interrupting
or
at
least
watching
and
discovering
the
measures
adopted
by
the
insurgents
these
men
heads
were
as
usual
borne
on
pikes
among
their
ranks
sidenote
conflict
at
the
tuileries
they
pushed
forward
and
it
is
said
the
swiss
at
first
offered
demonstrations
of
truce
but
the
assailants
thronged
onward
crowded
on
the
barricade
and
when
the
parties
came
into
such
close
collision
a
struggle
ensued
and
a
shot
was
fired
it
is
doubtful
from
what
side
it
came
nor
is
it
of
much
consequence
for
on
such
an
occasion
that
body
must
be
held
the
aggressors
who
approach
the
pickets
of
the
other
armed
and
prepared
for
assault
and
although
the
first
gun
be
fired
by
those
whose
position
is
endangered
it
is
no
less
defensive
than
if
discharged
in
reply
to
a
fire
from
the
other
side
this
unhappy
shot
seems
to
have
dispelled
some
small
chance
of
a
reconciliation
between
the
parties
hard
firing
instantly
commenced
from
the
federates
and
marseillois
whilst
the
palace
blazed
forth
fire
from
every
window
and
killed
a
great
many
of
the
assailants
the
swiss
whose
numbers
were
now
only
about
seven
hundred
men
determined
notwithstanding
upon
a
sally
which
in
the
beginning
was
completely
successful
they
drove
the
insurgents
from
the

many
of
the
marseillois

bretons

some
of
their
guns
and
turning
them
along
the
streets
compelled
the
assailants
to
actual
flight
so
that
word
was
carried
to
the
national
assembly
that
the
swiss
were
victorious
the
utmost
confusion
prevailed
there
the
deputies
upbraided
each
other
with
their
share
in
bringing
about
the
insurrection
brissot
showed
timidity
and
several
of
the
deputies
thinking
the
guards
were
hastening
to
massacre
them
attempted
to
escape
by
the
windows
of
the
hall
if
indeed
the
sally
of
the
swiss
had
been
supported
by
a
sufficient
body
of

the
revolution
might
have
been
that
day
ended
but
the
the
only
horsemen
in
the
field
were
devoted
to

conceiving

they
had
no

collected
themselves
into
a
body
and
attempted
to
cross
the
garden
of
the
tuileries

exposed
to

destructive
fire

all
sides
the
remains

noble
regiment

faithful

assigned
to
it

charged
repeatedly
by

treacherous
who

were
separated
into
platoons
which
continued
to
defend
themselves
with
courage
even
till
the
very
last
of
them
was
overpowered
dispersed
and
destroyed
by
multitudes
a

fearful
odds

useless
one

burst
into

the
most
barbarous

had

and
while
some
massacred
the
living
others

the
unsexed

who
were
mingled
in

committed
the
most
shameful
butchery
on
the
corpses
of

almost
every
species

make
themselves

that
the

the

he
seized
on

sent

compel

the

enemy

of

recognised
the

that
unfortunate

considerable
part
even
of

own

so
that
with
three
friends
whose
names
were
well
known
in
the
revolution
he
was
fain
to
attempt
an
escape
from
france
and
in
crossing
a
part
of
the
frontier
they
were
made
prisoners
by
a
party
of
prussians
fugitives
from
their
own
camp
for
the
sake
of
royalty
they
might
have
expected
refuge
in
that
of
the
allied
kings
who
were
in
arms
for
the
same
object
but
with
a
littleness
of
spirit
which
augured
no
good
for
their
cause
the
allies
determined
that
these
unfortunate
gentlemen
should
be
consigned
as
state
prisoners
to
different
fortresses
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
monarchs
however
irritated
they
might
be
by
the
recollection
of
some
part
of
la
fayette
conduct
in
the
outset
of
the
revolution
was
neither
to
be
vindicated
by
morality
the
law
of
nations
nor
the
rules
of
sound
policy
we
are
no
approvers
of
the
democratic
species
of
monarchy
which
la
fayette
endeavoured
to
establish
and
can
not
but
be
of
opinion
that
if
he
had
acted
upon
his
victory
in
the
champ
de
mars
he
might
have
shut
up
the
jacobin
club
and
saved
his
own
power
and
popularity
from
being
juggled
out
of
his
hands
by
those
sanguinary
charlatans
but
errors
of
judgment
must
be
pardoned
to
men
placed
amidst
difficulties
and
la
conduct
on
his
visit
to
paris
bore
testimony
to
his
real
willingness
to
save
the
king
and
preserve
the
monarchy
but
even
if
he
had
been
amenable
for
a
crime
against
his
own
country
we
know
not
what
right
austria
or
prussia
had
to
take
cognizance
of
it
to
them
he
was
a
mere
prisoner
of
war
and
nothing
farther
lastly
it
is
very
seldom
that
a
petty
and
vindictive
line
of
policy
can
consist
with
the
real
interest
either
of
great
princes
or
of
private
individuals
in
the
present
case
the
arrest
of
la
fayette
was
peculiarly
the
contrary
it
afforded
a
plain
proof
to
france
and
to
all
europe
that
the
allied
monarchs
were
determined
to
regard
as
enemies
all
who
had
in
any
manner
or
to
any
extent
favoured
the
revolution
being
indeed
the
whole
people
of
france
excepting
the
emigrants
now
in
arms
the
effect
must
necessarily
have
been
to
compel
every
frenchman
who
was
desirous
of
enjoying
more
liberty
than
the
ancient
despotism
permitted
into
submission
to
the
existing
government
whatever
it
was
so
long
as
invading
armies
of
foreigners
whose
schemes
were
apparently
as
inconsistent
with
the
welfare
as
with
the
independence
of
the
country
were
hanging
on
the
frontiers
of
france

a
short
space

hounds
over
the
carcass

the
prey

and
jacobins
suspended
their
dissensions
but
when
the
constitutional
party
had
ceased
to
show
all
signs
of
existence
their
brawl
soon
recommenced
and
the
girondists
early
discovered
that
in
the
allies
whom
they
had
called
on
to
assist
them
in
the
subjugation
of
royalty
they
had
already
to
strive
with
men
who
though
inferior
to
them
in
speculative
knowledge
and
in
the
eloquence
which
was
to
sway
the
assembly
possessed
in
a
much
higher
degree
the
practical
energies
by
which
revolutions
are
accomplished
were
in
complete
possession
of
the
community
or
magistracy
of
paris
and
maintained
despotic
authority
over
all
the
bands
of
the
metropolis
three
men
of
terror
whose
names
will
long
remain
we
trust
unmatched
in
history
by
those
of
any
similar
miscreants
had
now
the
unrivalled
leading
of
the
jacobins
and
were
called

triumvirate
danton
deserves
to
be
named
first
as
unequalled
by
his
colleagues
in
talent
and
audacity
he
was
a
man
of
gigantic
size
and
possessed
a
voice
of
thunder
his
countenance
was
that
of
an
ogre
on
the
shoulders
of
a
hercules
he
was
as
fond
of
the
pleasures
of
vice
as
of
the
practice
of
cruelty
and
it
was
said
there
were
times
when
he
became
humanized
amidst
his
debauchery
laughed
at
the
terror
which
his
furious
declamations
excited
and
might
be
approached
with
safety
like
the
maelstrom
at
the
turn
of
tide
his
profusion
was
indulged
to
an
extent
hazardous
to
his
popularity
for
the
populace
are
jealous
of
a
lavish
expenditure
as
raising
their
favourites
too
much
above
their
own
degree
and
the
charge
of
peculation
finds
always
ready
credit
with
them
when
brought
against
public
men
sidenote
robespierre
robespierre
possessed
this
advantage
over
danton
that
he
did
not
seem
to
seek
for
wealth
either
for
hoarding
or
expending
but
lived
in
strict
and
economical
retirement
to
justify
the
name
of
the
incorruptible
with
which
he
was
honoured
by
his
partisans
he
appears
to
have
possessed
little
talent
saving
a
deep
fund
of
hypocrisy
considerable
powers
of
sophistry
and
a
cold
exaggerated
strain
of
oratory
as
foreign
to
good
taste
as
the
measures
he
recommended
were
to
ordinary
humanity
it
seemed
wonderful
that
even
the
seething
and
boiling
of
the
revolutionary
cauldron
should
have
sent
up
from
the
bottom
and
long
supported
on
the
surface
a
thing
so
miserably
void
of
claims
to
public
distinction
but
robespierre
had
to
impose
on
the
minds
of
the
vulgar
and
he
knew
how
to
beguile
them
by
accommodating
his
flattery
to
their
passions
and
scale
of
understanding
and
by
acts
of
cunning
and
hypocrisy
which
weigh
more
with
the
multitude
than
the
words
of
eloquence
or
the
arguments
of
wisdom
the
people
listened
as
to
their
cicero
when
he
twanged
out
his
apostrophes
of
pauvre
peuple
peuple
vertueux
and
hastened
to
execute
whatever
came
recommended
by
such
honied
phrases
though
devised
by
the
worst
of
men
for
the
worst
and
most
inhuman
of
purposes
vanity
was
robespierre
ruling
passion
and
though
his
countenance
was
the
image
of
his
mind
he
was
vain
even
of
his
personal
appearance
and
never
adopted
the
external
habits
of
a
sans
culotte
amongst
his
fellow
jacobins
he
was
distinguished
by
the
nicety
with
which
his
hair
was
arranged
and
powdered
and
the
neatness
of
his
dress
was
carefully
attended
to
so
as
to
counterbalance
if
possible
the
vulgarity
of
his
person
his
apartments
though
small
were
elegant
and
vanity
had
filled
them
with
representations
of
the
occupant
robespierre
picture
at
length
hung
in
one
place
his
miniature
in
another
his
bust
occupied
a
niche
and
on
the
table
were
disposed
a
few
medallions
exhibiting
his
head
in
profile
the
vanity
which
all
this
indicated
was
of
the
coldest
and
most
selfish
character
being
such
as
considers
neglect
as
insult
and
receives
homage
merely
as
a
tribute
so
that
while
praise
is
received
without
gratitude
it
is
withheld
at
the
risk
of
mortal
hate
of
this
dangerous
character
is
closely
allied
with
envy
and
robespierre
was
one
of
the
most
envious
and
vindictive
men
that
ever
lived
he
never
was
known
to
pardon
any
opposition
affront
or
even
rivalry
and
to
be
marked
in
his
tablets
on
such
an
account
was
a
sure
though
perhaps
not
an
immediate
sentence
of
death
danton
was
a
hero
compared
with
this
cold
calculating
creeping
miscreant
for
his
passions
though
exaggerated
had
at
least
some
touch
of
humanity
and
his
brutal
ferocity
was
supported
by
brutal
courage
robespierre
was
a
coward
who
signed
with
a
hand
that
shook
though
his
heart
was
relentless
he
possessed
no
passions
on
which
to
charge
his
crimes
they
were
perpetrated
in
cold
blood
and
upon
mature
deliberation
marat
the
third
of
this
infernal
triumvirate
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
lower
orders
by
the
violence
of
his
sentiments
in
the
journal
which
he
conducted
from
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
upon
such
principles
that
it
took
the
lead
in
forwarding
its
successive
changes
his
political
exhortations
began
and
ended
like
the
howl
of
a
for
murder
or
if
a
wolf
could
have
written
a
journal
the
gaunt
and
famished
wretch
could
not
have
ravened
more
eagerly
for
slaughter
it
was
blood
which
was
marat
constant
demand
not
in
drops
from
the
breast
of
an
individual
not
in
puny
streams
from
the
slaughter
of
families
but
blood
in
the
profusion
of
an
ocean
his
usual
calculation
of
the
heads
which
he
demanded
amounted
to
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
and
though
he
sometimes
raised
it
as
high
as
three
hundred
thousand
it
never
fell
beneath
the
smaller
number
it
may
be
hoped
and
for
the
honour
of
human
nature
we
are
inclined
to
believe
there
was
a
touch
of
insanity
in
this
unnatural
strain
of
ferocity
and
the
wild
and
squalid
features
of
the
wretch
appear
to
have
intimated
a
degree
of
alienation
of
mind
marat
was
like
robespierre
a
coward
repeatedly
denounced
in
the
assembly
he
skulked
instead
of
defending
himself
and
lay
concealed
in
some
obscure
garret
or
cellar
among
his
until
a
storm
appeared
when
like
a
bird
of
ill
omen
his
was
again
heard
such
was
the
strange
and
fatal
triumvirate
in
which
the
same
degree
of
cannibal
cruelty
existed
under
different
aspects
danton
murdered
to
glut
his
rage
robespierre
to
avenge
his
injured
vanity
or
to
remove
a
rival
whom
he
envied
marat
from
the
same
instinctive
love
of
blood
which
induces
a
wolf
to
continue
his
ravage
of
the
flocks
long
after
his
hunger
is
appeased
these
three
men
were
in
complete
possession
of
the
community
of
paris
which
was
filled
with
their
adherents
exclusively
and
which
now
in
command
of
the
armed
force
that
had
achieved
the
victory
of
the
of
august
held
the
assembly
as
absolutely
under
their
control
as
the
assembly
prior
to
that
period
had
held
the
person
of
the
king
it
is
true
pétion
was
still
mayor
of
paris
but
being
considered
as
a
follower
of
roland
and
brissot
he
was
regarded
by
the
jacobins
as
a
prisoner
and
detained
in
a
sort
of
honourable
restraint
having
a
body
of
their
most
faithful
adherents
constantly
around
him
as
a
guard
which
they
pretended
was
assigned
for
his
defence
and
protection
the
truth
is
that
pétion
a
vain
man
and
of
very
moderate
talents
had
already
lost
his
consequence
his
temporary
popularity
arose
almost
solely
out
of
the
enmity
entertained
against
him
by
the
court
and
his
having
braved
on
one
or
two
occasions
the
king
personal
displeasure
particularly
on
the
of

this
merit
was
now
forgotten
and
pétion
was
fast
sinking
into
his
natural
nullity
nothing
could
be
more
pitiful
than
the
appearance
of
this
magistrate
whose
name
had
been
so
lately
the
theme
of
every
tongue
in
paris
when
brought
to
the
bar
of
the
assembly
pale
and
hesitating
to
back
by
his
appearance
among
his
terrible
revolutionary
associates
petitions
for
measures
as
distasteful
to
himself
as
to
his
friends
of
the
gironde
party
who
had
apparently
no
power
to
deliver
him
from
his
state
of
humiliating
restraint
sidenote
revolutionary
tribunals
the
demands
of
the
community
of
paris
now
the
sanhedrim
of
the
jacobins
were
of
course
for
blood
and
vengeance
and
revolutionary
tribunals
to
make
short
and
sharp
execution
upon
constitutionalist
and
royalist
soldier
and
priest
upon
all
who
acted
on
the
principle
that
the
king
had
some
right
to
defend
his
person
and
residence
against
a
furious
mob
armed
with
muskets
and
cannon
and
upon
all
who
could
by
any
possible
implication
be
charged
with
having
approved
such
doctrines
as
leaned
towards
monarchy
at
any
time
during
all
the
changes
of
this
revolution
a
revolutionary
tribunal
was
appointed
accordingly
but
the
girondists
to
impose
some
check
on
its
measures
rendered
the
judgment
of
a
jury
necessary
for
condemnation
an
encumbrance
which
seemed
to
the
jacobins
a
needless
and
uncivic
restriction
of
the
rights
of
the
people
robespierre
was
to
have
been
appointed
president
of
this
tribunal
but
he
declined
the
office
on
account
of
his
philanthropic
principles
meantime
the
sharpness
of
its
proceedings
was
sufficiently
assured
by
the
nomination
of
danton
to
the
office
of
minister
of
justice
which
had
fallen
to
his
lot
as
a
jacobin
while
roland
servan
and
clavière
alike
fearing
and
detesting
their
dreadful
colleague
assumed
with
monge
and
lebrun
the
other
offices
in
what
was
now
called
a
provisionary
executive
these
last
five
ministers
were
girondists
it
was
not
the
serious
intention
of
the
assembly
to
replace
louis
in
a
palace
or
to
suffer
him
to
retain
the
smallest
portion
of
personal
freedom
or
political
influence
it
had
indeed
been
decreed
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
that
he
should
inhabit
the
luxembourg
palace
but
on
the
his
residence
was
transferred
with
that
of
the
royal
family
to
an
ancient
fortress
called
the
temple
from
the
knights

to
whom
it
once
belonged
there
was
in
front
a
house
with
some
more
modern
apartments
but
the
dwelling
of
louis
was
the
donjon
or
ancient
keep
itself
a
huge
square
tower
of
great
antiquity
consisting
of
four
stories
each
story
contained
two
or
three
rooms
or
closets
but
these
apartments
were
unfurnished
and
offered
no
convenience
for
the
accommodation
of
an
ordinary
family
much
less
to
prisoners
of
such
distinction
the
royal
family
were
guarded
with
a
strictness
of
which
every
day
increased

rigour
sidenote

of

in
the
meanwhile
the

was
acquitted

found
grace
in
the
eyes
of

so

afterwards
doomed

of

not
half
sufficed
and
greedy
yet
to
kill
but
he
had
already
devised
within
his
soul
and
agitated
amongst
his
compeers
a
scheme
of
vengeance
so
dark
and
dreadful
as
never
ruffian
before
or
since
had
head
to
contrive
or
nerve
to
execute
it
was
a
measure
of
extermination
which
the
jacobins
resolved
upon
a
measure
so
sweeping
in
its
purpose
and
extent
that
it
should
at
once
drown
in
their
own
blood
every
royalist
or
constitutionalist
who
could
raise
a
finger
or
even
entertain
a
thought
against
them
three
things
were
indispensably
essential
to
their
execrable
plan
in
the
first
place
they
had
to
collect
and
place
within
reach
of
their
assassins
the
numerous
victims
whom
they
sought
to
overwhelm
with
this
common
destruction
secondly
it
was
necessary
to
intimidate
the
assembly
and
the
girondist
party
in
particular
sensible
that
they
were
likely
to
interfere
if
it
was
left
in
their
power
to
prevent
acts
of
cruelty
incompatible
with
the
principles
of
most
or
all
of
their
number
lastly
the
jacobin
chiefs
were
aware
that
ere
they
could
prepare
the
public
mind
to
endure
the
massacres
which
they
meditated
it
was
necessary
they
should
wait
for
one
of
those
critical
moments
of
general
alarm
in
which
fear
makes
the
multitude
cruel
and
when
the
agitations
of
rage
and
terror
combine
to
unsettle
men
reason
and
drown
at
once
their
humanity
and
their
understanding
to
collect
prisoners
in
any
numbers
was
an
easy
matter
when
the
mere
naming
a
man
however
innocent
as
an
aristocrat
or
a
suspected
person
especially
if
he
happened
to
have
a
name
indicative
of
gentle
blood
and
an
air
of
decency
in
apparel
was
sufficient
ground
for
sending
him
to
prison
for
the
purpose
of
making
such
arrests
upon
suspicion
the
commune
of
paris
openly
took
upon
themselves
the
office
of
granting
warrants
for
imprisoning
individuals
in
great
numbers
and
at
length
proceeded
so
far
in
their
violent
and
arbitrary
conduct
as
to
excite
the
jealousy
of
the
legislative
body
this
assembly
of
national
representatives
seemed
to
have
been
stunned
by
the
events
of
the
of
august
of
the
deputies
had
a
few
days
before
exculpated
la
fayette
for
the
zeal
with
which
he
impeached
the
unsuccessful
attempt
of
the
of
june
designed
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose
which
had
been
effected
on
this
last
dread
epoch
of
the
revolution
the
same
number
we
must
suppose
were
inimical
to
the
revolution
achieved
by
the
taking
of
the
tuileries
and
the
dethronement
of
the
monarch
whom
it
had
been
la
fayette
object
to
protect
and
defend
in
dignity
and
person
but
there
was
no
energy
left
in
that
portion
of
the
assembly
though
by
far
the
largest
and
the
wisest
their
benches
were
left
deserted
nor
did
any
voice
arise
either
to
sustain
their
own
dignity
or
as
a
last
resource
to
advise
a
union
with
the
girondists
now
the
leading
force
in
the
representative
body
for
the
purpose
of
putting
a
period
to
the
rule
of
revolutionary
terror
over
that
of
civil
order
the
girondists
themselves
proposed
no
decisive
measures
and
indeed
appear
to
have
been
the
most
helpless
party
though
possessing
in
their
ranks
very
considerable
talent
that
ever
attempted
to
act
a
great
part
in
the
convulsions
of
a
state
they
seem
to
have
expected
that
so
soon
as
they
had
accomplished
the
overthrow
of
the
throne
their
own
supremacy
should
have
been
established
in
its
room
they
became
therefore
liable
to
the
disappointment
of
a
child
who
having
built
his
house
of
boughs
after
his
own
fashion
is
astonished
to
find
those
bigger
and
stronger
than
himself
throw
its
materials
out
of
their
way
instead
of
attempting
according
to
his
expectations
to
creep
into
it
for
the
purpose
of
shelter
sidenote
commune
of
paris
late
and
timidly
they
at
length
began
to
remonstrate
against
the
usurped
power
of
the
commune
of
paris
who
paid
them
as
little
regard
as
they
were
themselves
doing
to
the
constituted
authorities
of
the
executive
power
the
complaints
which
were
laid
before
them
of
the
violent
encroachments
made
on
the
liberty
of
the
people
at
large
the
girondists
had
hitherto
answered
by
timid
exhortations
to
the
commune
to
be
cautious
in
their
proceedings
but
on
the
of
august
they
were
startled
out
of
their
weak
inaction
by
an
assumption
of
open
force
and
open
villany
on
the
part
of
those
formidable
rivals
under
which
it
was
impossible
to
remain
silent
on
the
night
previous
the
commune
proceeding
to
act
upon
their
own
sole
authority
had
sent
their
satellites
consisting
of
the
municipal
officers
who
were
exclusively
attached
to
them
who
were
selected
from
the
most
determined
jacobins
and
had
been
augmented
to
an
extraordinary
number
to
seize
arms
of
every
description
and
to
arrest
suspicious
persons
in
every
corner
of
paris
hundreds
and
thousands
of
individuals
had
been
under
these
usurped
powers
committed
to
the
various
prisons
of
the
city
which
were
now
filled
even
to
choking
with
all
persons
of
every
sex
and
age
against
whom
political
hatred
could
allege
suspicion
or
private
hatred

an
old
quarrel
or

of
plunder
awake
a
thirst
for
confiscation
the
deeds
of
robbery
of
license
and
of
ferocity
committed
during
these
illegal
proceedings
as
well
as
the
barefaced
contempt
which
they
indicated
of
the
authority
of
the
assembly
awakened
the
girondists
but
too
late
to
some
sense
of
the
necessity
of
exertion
they
summoned
the
municipality
to
their
bar
they
came
not
to
deprecate
the
displeasure
of
the
assembly
not
to
submit
themselves
to
its
mercy
they
came
to
triumph
and
brought
the
speechless
and
trembling
pétion
in
their
train
as
their
captive
rather
than
their
mayor
tallien
explained
the
defence
of
the

which
amounted
to
this
the
provisional
representatives
of
the
city
of
paris
he
said
had
been
calumniated
they
appeared
to
justify
what
they
had
done
not
as
accused
persons
but
as
triumphing
in
having
discharged
their
duty
the
sovereign
people
he
said
had
committed
to
them
full
powers
saying
go
forth
save
the
country
in
our
name
whatever
you
do
we
will
ratify
this
language
was
in
effect
that
of
defiance
and
it
was
supported
by
the
shouts
and
howls
of
assembled
multitudes
armed
as
for
the
attack
on
the
tuileries
and
their
courage
it
may
be
imagined
not
the
less
that
there
were
neither
aristocrats
nor
swiss
guards
between
them
and
the
legislative
assembly
their
cries
were
long
live

excellent
commissioners
we
will
defend
them
or
die

satellites
of
the
same
party
in
the
tribunes
or
galleries
joined
in
the
cry
with
invectives
on
those
members
of
the
assembly
who
were
supposed
however
republican
in
principle
to
be
opposed
to
the
revolutionary
measures
of
the
commune
the
mob
without
soon
forced
their
way
into
the
hall
joined
with
the
mob
within
and
left
the
theoretical
republicans
of
the
assembly
the
choice
of
acquiescence
in
their
dictates
flight
or
the
liberty
of
dying
on
their
posts
like
the
senators
of
that
rome
which
they
admired
none
embraced
this
last
alternative
they
broke
up
the
meeting
in
confusion
and
left
the
jacobins
secure
of
impunity
in
whatever
they
might
next
choose
to
attempt
thus
danton
and
his
fell
associates
achieved
the
second
point
necessary
to
the
execution
of
the
horrors
which
they
meditated
the
legislative
assembly
were
completely
subdued
and
intimidated
it
remained
to
avail
themselves
of
some
opportunity
which
might
excite
the
people
of
paris
in
their
present
feverish
state
to
participate
in
or
to
endure
crimes
at
which
in
calm
moments
the
rudest
would
probably
have
shuddered
the
state
of
affairs
on
the
frontier
aided
them
with
such
an
opportunity
them
we
say
because
every
step
of
preparation
beforehand
shows
that
the
horrors
acted
on
the
september
were
premeditated
nay
the
very
trenches
destined
to
inhume
hundreds
and
thousands
of
prisoners
yet
alive
untried
and
undoomed
were
already
excavated
a
temporary
success
of
the
allied
monarchs
fell
upon
the
mine
already
prepared
and
gave
fire
to
it
as
lightning
might
have
fired
a
powder
magazine
longwy
stenay
and
verdun
were
announced
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
king
of

the
first
and
last
were
barrier
fortresses
of
reputed
strength
and
considerable
resistance
had
been
expected
the
ardent
and
military
spirit
of
the
french
was
awakened
in
the
resolute
upon
learning
that
their
frontier
was
thus
invaded
fear
and
discomfiture
took
possession
of
others
who
thought
they
already
heard
the
allied
trumpets
at
the
gates
of
paris
between
the
eager
desire
of
some
to
march
against
the
army
of
the
invaders
and
the
terror
and
dismay
of
others
there
arose
a
climax
of
excitation
and
alarm
favourable
to
the
execution
of
every
desperate
design
as
ruffians
ply
their
trade
best
and
with
least
chance
of
interruption
in
the
midst
of
an
earthquake
or
a
conflagration
on
the
september
the
commune
of
paris
announced
the
fall
of
longwy
and
the
approaching
fate
of
verdun
and
as
if
it
had
been
the
only
constituted
authority
in
the
country
commanded
the
most
summary
measures
for
the
general
defence
all
citizens
were
ordered
to
keep
themselves
in
readiness
to
march
on
an
instant
warning
all
arms
were
to
be
given
up
to
the
commune
save
those
in
the
hands
of
active
citizens
armed
for
the
public
protection
suspected
persons
were
to
be
disarmed
and
other
measures
were
announced
all
of
which
were
calculated
to
call
men
attention
to
the
safety
of
themselves
and
their
families
and
to
destroy
the
interest
which
at
ordinary
times
the
public
would
have
taken
in
the
fate
of
others
the
awful
voice
of
danton
astounded
the
assembly
with
similar
information
hardly
deigning
to
ask
their
approbation
of
the
measures
which
the
commune
of
paris
had
adopted
on
their
own
sole
authority
you
will
presently
hear
he
said
the
falsely
so
called
for
they
are
the
signal
of
a
charge
courage
courage
and
once
again
courage
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
conquer
our
enemies
these
words
pronounced
with
the
accent
and
attitude
of
an
exterminating
spirit
appalled
and
stupified
the
assembly
we
find
nothing
that
indicated
in
them
either
interest
in
the
imminent
danger
of
the
public
from
without
or
in
the
usurpation
from
within
they
appeared
paralysed
with
terror
the
armed
bands
of
paris
marched
in
different
quarters
to
seize
arms
and
horses
to
discover
and
denounce
suspected
persons
the
youth
fit
for
arms
were
every
where
mustered
and
amid
shouts
remonstrances
and
debates
the
general
attention
was
so
engaged
each
individual
with
his
own
affairs
in
his
own
quarter
that
without
interference
of
any
kind
whether
from
legal
authority
or
general
sympathy
a
universal
massacre
of
the
numerous
prisoners
was
perpetrated
with
a
quietness
and
deliberation
which
has
not
its
parallel
in
history
the
reader
who
may
be
still
surprised
that
a
transaction
so
horrid
should
have
passed
without
opposition
or
interruption
must
be
again
reminded
of
the
astounding
effects
of
the
popular
victory
of
the
of
august
of
the
total
quiescence
of
the
legislative
assembly
of
the
want
of
an
armed
force
of
any
kind
to
oppose
such
outrages
and
of
the
epidemic
panic
which
renders
multitudes
powerless
and
passive
as
infants
should
these
causes
not
appear
to
him
sufficient
he
must
be
contented
to
wonder
at
the
facts
we
are
to
relate
as
at
one
of
those
dreadful
prodigies
by
which
providence
confounds
our
reason
and
shows
what
human
nature
can
be
brought
to
when
the
restraints
of
morality
and
religion
are
cast
aside
the
number
of
individuals
accumulated
in
the
various
prisons
of
paris
had
increased
by
the
arrests
and
domiciliary
visits
subsequent
to
the
of
august
to
about
eight
thousand
persons
it
was
the
object
of
this
infernal
scheme
to
destroy
the
greater
part
of
these
under
one
general
system
of
murder
not
to
be
executed
by
the
sudden
and
furious
impulse
of
an
armed
multitude
but
with
a
certain
degree
of
cold
blood
and
deliberate
investigation
a
force
of
armed
banditti
marseillois
partly
and
partly
chosen
ruffians
of
the
fauxbourgs
proceeded
to
the
several
prisons
into
which
they
either
forced
their
passage
or
were
admitted
by
the
jailors
most
of
whom
had
been
apprised
of
what
was
to
take
place
though
some
even
of
these
steeled
officials
exerted
themselves
to
save
those
under
their
charge
a
revolutionary
tribunal
was
formed
from
among
the
armed
ruffians
themselves
who
examined
the
registers
of
the
prisons
and
summoned
the
captives
individually
to
undergo

were

of

yet
there
were
occasions
when
they
showed
some
transient
gleams
of
humanity
and
it
is
not
unimportant
to
remark
that
boldness
had
more
influence
on
them
than
any
appeal
to

or
compassion
an

royalist
was
occasionally
dismissed

while
the

brief
were
these
symptoms

relenting
in

the
doom
of
the

was
death
and
that
doom
was

in

by
holding
up

crime
seems
to
have
been
her

literally
hewn
to

and
her

and
that
of
others

the
municipal
officers
who
were
upon

had
difficulty
not
merely
in
saving
them
from
this
horrible
inhumanity
but
also
in
preventing

this
frail

was
found

to
intimate
that

we
do
not
read
that
the
efficiency
of
the
ribbons
was
tried
for
the
protection
of
any
of
the
other
prisons
no
doubt
the
executioners
had
their
instructions
where
and
when
they
should
be
respected
the
clergy
who
had
declined
the
constitutional
oath
from
pious
scruples
were
during
the
massacre
the
peculiar
objects
of
insult
and
cruelty
and
their
conduct
was
such
as
corresponded
with
their
religious
and
conscientious
professions
they
were
seen
confessing
themselves
to
each
other
or
receiving
the
confessions
of
their
lay
companions
in
misfortune
and
encouraging
them
to
undergo
the
evil
hour
with
as
much
calmness
as
if
they
themselves
had
not
been
to
share
its
bitterness
as
protestants
we
can
not
abstractedly
approve
of
the
doctrines
which
render
the
established
clergy
of
one
country
dependent
upon
a
sovereign
pontiff
the
prince
of
an
alien
state
but
these
priests
did
not
make
the
laws
for
which
they
suffered
they
only
obeyed
them
and
as
men
and
christians
we
must
regard
them
as
martyrs
who
preferred
death
to
what
they
considered
as
apostasy
in
the
brief
intervals
of
this
dreadful
butchery
which
lasted
for
four
days
the
judges
and
executioners
ate
drank
and
slept
and
awoke
from
slumber
or
rose
from
their
meal
with
fresh
appetite
for
murder

were

reckoned
on

the
example
was
not
generally

can
be

it
was
either
from
a
desire
to
continue
as
long
as
possible
a
labour
so
well
requited
or
because
these

had
acquired
an
insatiable
lust
of

not

two

hundred
of
the

may
be

to
know

to
put

more
formidable
force
than
that

hundred

often
indeed
diminished
to
only
fifty
or
sixty
he
might
reasonably
expect
that
the
national
representatives
would
have
thundered
forth
some
of
those
decrees
which
they
formerly
directed
against
the
crown
and
the
noblesse

they
should
have

that

who
had
the
breath
and
being
of

support
them
in

of
horrors

to
mankind
such
an
appeal

them
at
last
successful
in
the
overthrow
of

but
the
reign
of
terror
was
now
but
in
its
commencement
and
men
had
not
yet
learned
that
there
lay
a
refuge
in
the
efforts
of
despair
instead
of
such
energy
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
principles
of
which
they
boasted
nothing
could
be
more
timid
than
the
conduct
of
the
girondists
being
the
only
party
in
the
assembly
who
had
the
power
and
might
be
supposed
to
have
the
inclination
to
control
the
course
of
crime
we
looked
carefully
through
the
which
contain
the
official
account
of
the
sittings
of
the
assembly
on
these
dreadful
days
we
find
regular
entries
of
many
patriotic
gifts
of
such
importance
as
the
following
a
fusee
from
an
englishman
a
pair
of
horses
from
the
coachman
a
map
of
the
country
around
paris
from
a
lady
while
engaged
in
receiving
and
registering
these
civic
donations
their
journal
bears
few
and
doubtful
references
to
the
massacres
then
in
progress
the
assembly
issued
no
decree
against
the
slaughter
demanded
no
support
from
the
public
force
and
restricted
themselves
to
sending
to
the
murderers
a
pitiful
deputation
of
twelve
of
their
number
whose
commission
seems
to
have
been
limited
to
petition
for
the
safety
of
one
of
their
colleagues
belonging
to
the
constitutional
faction
with
difficulty
they
saved
him
and
the
celebrated
abbé
sicard
the
philanthropic
instructor
of
the
deaf
and
dumb
imprisoned
as
a
priest
for
whom
the
wails
and
tears
of
his
hapless
pupils
had
procured
a
reprieve
even
from
the
assassins
dussault
one
of
that
deputation
distinguished
himself
by
the
efforts
which
he
used
to
persuade
the
murderers
to
desist
return
to
your
place
said
one
of
the
ruffians
his
arms
crimsoned
with
blood
you
have
made
us
lose
too
much
time
return
to
your
own
business
and
leave
us
to
ours
sidenote
apathy
of
the
assembly
dussault
went
back
to
recount
to
those
who
had
sent
him
what
he
had
witnessed
and
how
he
had
been
received
and
concluded
with
the
exclamation
woe
me
that
i
should
have
lived
to
see
such
horrors
without
the
power
of
stopping
them
the
assembly
heard
the
detail
and
remained
timid
and
silent
as
before
where
in
that
hour
were
the
men
who
formed
their
judgment
upon
the
models
presented
by
plutarch
their
feelings
on
the
wild
eloquence
of
rousseau
where
were
the
girondists
celebrated
by
one
of
their
admirers
as
distinguished
by
good
morals
by
severe
probity
by
a
profound
respect
for
the
dignity
of
man
by
a
deep
sense
of
his
rights
and
his
duties
by
a
sound
constant
and
immutable
love
of
order
of
justice
and
of
liberty
were
the
eyes
of
such
men
blind
that
they
could
not
see
the
blood
which
flooded
for
four
days
the
streets
of
the
metropolis
were
their
ears
deadened
that
they
could
not
hear
the
shouts
of
the
murderers
and
the
screams
of
the
victims
or
were
their
voices
mute
that
they
called
not
upon
god
and
man
upon
the
very
stones
of
paris
to
assist
them
in
interrupting
such
a
crime
political
reasons
have
by
royalist
writers
been
supposed
to
furnish
a
motive
for
their
acquiescence
for
there
is
according
to
civilians
a
certain
degree
of
careless
or
timid
imbecility
which
can
only
be
explained
as
having
its
origin
in
fraud
they
allege
that
the
girondists
saw
rather
with
pleasure
than
horror
the
atrocities
which
were
committed
while
their
enemies
the
jacobins
exterminating
their
equally
hated
enemies
the
constitutionalists
and
royalists
took
on
themselves
the
whole
odium
of
a
glut
of
blood
which
must
soon
they
might
naturally
expect
disgust
the
sense
and
feelings
of
a
country
so
civilized
as
france
we
remain
nevertheless
convinced
that
vergniaud
brissot
roland
and
to
a
certainty
his
wife
would
have
stopped
the
massacres
of
september
had
their
courage
and
practical
skill
in
public
affairs
borne
any
proportion
to
the
conceit
which
led
them
to
suppose
that
their
vocation
lay
for
governing
such
a
nation
as
france
but
whatever
was
the
motive
of
their
apathy
the
legislative
assembly
was
nearly
silent
on
the
subject
of
the
massacres
not
only
while
they
were
in
progress
but
for
several
days
afterwards
on
the
of
september
when
news
from
the
army
on
the
frontiers
was
beginning
to
announce
successes
and
when
the
panic
of
the
metropolis
began
to
subside
vergniaud
adroitly
charged
the
jacobins
with
turning
on
unhappy
prisoners
of
state
the
popular
resentment
which
should
have
animated
them
with
bravery
to
march
out
against
the
common
enemy
he
upbraided
also
the
commune
of
paris
with
the
assumption
of
unconstitutional
powers
and
the
inhuman
tyranny
with
which
they
had
abused
them
but
his
speech
made
little
impression
so
much
are
deeds
of
cruelty
apt
to
become
familiar
to
men
feelings
when
of
frequent
recurrence
when
the
first
accounts
were
read
in
the
constituent
assembly
of
the
massacres
perpetrated
at
avignon
the
president
fainted
away
and
the
whole
body
manifested
a
horror
as
well
of
the
senses
as
of
the
mind
and
now
that
a
far
more
cruel
more
enduring
more
extensive
train
of
murders
was
perpetrated
under
their
own
eye
the
legislative
assembly
looked
on
in
apathy
the
utmost
which
the
eloquence
of
vergniaud
could
extract
from
them
was
a
decree
that
in
future
the
commune
should
be
answerable
with
their
own
lives
for
the
security
of
the
prisoners
under
their
charge
after
passing
this
decree
the
legislative
assembly
being
the
second
representative
body
of
the
french
nation
dissolved
itself
according
to
the
resolutions
of
the
of
august
to
give
place
to
the
national
convention
the
legislative
assembly
was
in
its
composition
and
its
character
of
a
caste
greatly
inferior
to
that
which
it
succeeded
the
flower
of
the
talents
of
france
had
naturally
centred
in
the
national
assembly
and
by
an
absurd
regulation
its
members
were
incapacitated
from
being
which
necessarily
occasioned
their
situation
being
in
many
instances
supplied
by
persons
of
inferior
attainments
then
the
destinies
of
the
first
assembly
had
been
fulfilled
in
a
more
lofty
manner
they
were
often
wrong
often
absurd
often
arrogant
and
presumptuous
but
never
mean
or
servile
they
respected
the
liberty
of
debate
and
even
amidst
the
bitterest
political
discussions
defended
the
persons
of
their
colleagues
however
much
opposed
to
them
in
sentiment
and
maintained
their
constitutional
inviolability
they
had
also
the
great
advantage
of
being
as
it
were
free
born
they
were
indeed
placed
in
captivity
by
their
removal
to
paris
but
their
courage
was
not
abated
nor
did
they
make
any
concessions
of
a
personal
kind
to
the
ruffians
by
whom
they
were
at
times
personally
but
the
second
or
legislative
assembly
had
on
the
contrary
been
captive
from
the
moment
of
their
first
convocation
they
had
never
met
but
in
paris
and
were
inured
to
the
habit
of
patient
submission
to
the
tribunes
and
the
refuse
of
the
city
who
repeatedly
broke
into
their
hall
and
issued
their
mandates
in
the
form
of
petitions
on
two
memorable
occasions
they
showed
too
distinctly
that
considerations
of
personal
safety
could
overpower
their
sense
of
public

in

be

upon
some

footing
the
government
of
france
and
for
replacing
that
constitution
to
which
faith
had
been
so
repeatedly
sworn
the
jacobins
made
the
most
energetic
exertions
they
not
only
wrote
missives
through
their
two
thousand
affiliated
societies
but
sent
three
hundred
commissaries
or
delegates
to
superintend
the
elections
in
the
different
towns
and
departments
to
exhort
their
comrades
not
only
to
be
firm

to
be
enterprising
and
to
seize
with
strong
hand
the
same

over

which
the

possessed

the

was
poured
into
willing

for
it
implied
the
sacred
right
of

with
the
concomitant
privileges
of

and

the
power
of
the
jacobins
was
irresistible
in
paris
where
robespierre
danton
and
marat
who
shared
the
high
places
in
their
synagogue
were
elected
by
an
immense
majority
and
of
the
twenty
deputies
who
represented
paris
there
were
not
above
five
or
six
unconnected
with
the
massacres
nor
were
they
any
where
unsuccessful
where
there
existed
enough
of
their
adherents
to
overawe
by
threats
clamour
and
violence
the
impartial
voice
of
the
public
but
in
every
state
there
is
a
great
number
of
men
who
love
order
for
itself
and
for
the
protection
it
affords
to
property
there
were
also
a
great
many
persons
at
heart
royalists
either
pure
or
constitutional
and
all
these
united
in
sending
to
the
national
convention
deputies
who
if
no
opportunity
occurred
of
restoring
the
monarchy
might
at
least
with
the
girondists
and
more
moderate
republicans
in
saving
the
life
of
the
unfortunate
louis
and
in
protecting
men
lives
and
property
in
general
from
the
infuriate
violence
of
the
jacobins
these
supporters
of
order
we
know
no
better
name
to
assign
to
them
were
chiefly
representatives
of
the
departments
where
electors
had
more
time
to
discriminate
and
reflect
than
when
under
the
influence
of
the
revolutionary
societies
and
clubs
of
the
towns
yet
nantes
bourdeaux
marseilles
lyons
and
other
towns
chiefly
in
the
west
and
south
were
disposed
to
support
the
girondists
and
sent
deputies
favourable
to
their
sentiments
thus
the
convention
when
assembled
still
presented
the
appearance
of
two
strong
parties
and
the
feebleness
of
that
which
being
moderate
in
its
views
only
sought
to
act
defensively
consisted
not
in
want
of
numbers
but
in
want
of
energy
it
was
no
good
omen
that
on
taking
their
places
in
the
assembly
these
last
assumed
the
right
side
a
position
which
seemed
doomed
to
defeat
since
it
had
been
successively
occupied
by
the
suppressed
parties
of
moderate
royalists
and
constitutionalists
there
was
defeat
in
the
very
sound
of
the
whereas
the
position
had
always
been
that
of
victory
men
minds
are
moved
by
small
incidents
in
dubious
times
even
this
choice
of
seats
made
an
impression
upon
spectators
and
auditors
unfavourable
to
the
girondists
as
all
naturally
shrink
from
a
union
with
bad
fortune
there
was
a
considerable
party
of
neutral
members
who
without
joining
themselves
to
the
girondists
affected
to
judge
impartially
betwixt
the
contending
parties
they
were
chiefly
men
of
consciences
too
timid
to
go
all
the
lengths
of
the
jacobins
but
also
of
too
timid
nerves
to
oppose
them
openly
and
boldly
these
were
sure
to
succumb
on
all
occasions
when
the
jacobins
judged
it
necessary
to
use
their
favourite
argument
of
popular
terror
the
girondists
took
possession
however
of
all
ostensible
marks
of
power
danton
was
dismissed
from
his
place
as
minister
of
justice
and
they
were
as
far
as
mere
official
name
and
title
could
bestow
it
on
them
in
possession
of
the
authority
of
government
but
the
regulation
which
excluded
ministers
from
seats
in
the
assembly
and
consequently
from
any
right
save
that
of
defence
proved
as
fatal
to
those
of
the
new
system
as
it
had
done
to
the
executive
government
of
louis
sidenote
france
declared
a
republic
our
remarks
upon
the
policy
of
the
great
change
from
monarchy
to
a
republic
will
be
more
in
place
elsewhere
indeed
violent
as
the
change
sounded
in
words
there
was
not
such
an
important
alteration
in
effect
as
to
produce
much
sensation
the
constitution
of
was
a
democracy
to
all
intents
and
purposes
leaving
little
power
with
the
king
and
that
little
subject
to
be
so
much
cramped
and
straitened
in
its
operation
that
the
royal
authority
was
even
smaller
in
practice
than
it
had
been
limited
in
theory
when
to
this
is
added
that
louis
was
a
prisoner
amongst
his
subjects
acting
under
the
most
severe
restraint
and
endangering
his
life
every
time
he
attempted
to
execute
his
constitutional
power
he
must
long
have
been
held
rather
an
incumbrance
on
the
motions
and
councils
of
the
state
than
as
one
of
its
efficient
constituted
authorities
the
nominal
change
of
the
system
of
government
scarcely
made
a
greater
alteration
in
the
internal
condition
of
france
than
the
change
of
a
sign
makes
upon
a
house
of
entertainment
where
the
business
of
the
tavern
is
carried
on
in
the
usual
way
although
the
place
is
no
longer
distinguished
as
the
head
sidenote
duke
of
brunswick
campaign
while
france
was
thus
alarmed
and
agitated
within
by
change
by
crime
by
the
most
bitter
political
factions
the
dawn
of
that
course
of
victory
had
already
risen
on
the
frontiers
which
in
its
noonday
splendour
was
to
blaze
fiercely
over
all
europe
it
is
not
our
purpose
to
detail
military
events
at
present
we
shall
have
but
too
many
of
them
to
discuss
hereafter
we
shall
barely
state
that
the
duke
of
brunswick
campaign
considered
as
relative
to
his
proclamation
forms
too
good
an
illustration
of
the
holy
text
pride
goeth
before
destruction
and
a
haughty
spirit
before
a
fall
the
duke
was
at
the
head
of
a
splendid
army
which
had
been
joined
by
fifteen
thousand
emigrants
in
the
finest
state
of
equipment
burning
with
zeal
to
rescue
the
king
and
avenge
themselves
on
those
by
whom
they
had
been
driven
from
their
country
from
what
fatality
it
is
hard
to
conceive
but
the
duke
of
brunswick
seems
to
have
looked
with
a
certain
degree
of
coldness
and
suspicion
on
those
troops
whose
chivalrous
valour
and
high
birth
called
them
to
the
van
instead
of
the
rear
in
which
the
generalissimo
was
pleased
to
detain
them
the
chance
of
success
that
might
justly
have
been
expected
from
the
fiery
energy
which
was
the
very
soul
of
french
chivalry
from
the
fear
which
such
an
army
might
have
inspired
or
perhaps
from
the
friends
whom
they
might
have
found
was
altogether
lost
there
was
something
in
this
extraordinary
conduct
which
almost
vindicated
the
suspicion
that
prussia
was
warring
on
her
own
account
and
was
not
disposed
to
owe
too
much
of
the
expected
success
to
the
valour
of
the
emigrants
and
it
escaped
not
the
remark
both
of
the
emigrants
and
the
french
at
large
that
longwy
and
verdun
were
ostentatiously
taken
possession
of
by
the
allies
not
under
the
name
of
the
king
of
france
or
the
comte
but
in
that
of
the
emperor
which
appeared
to
give
colour
to
the
invidious
report
that
the
allies
were
to
be
indemnified
for
the
cost
of
their
assistance
at
the
expense
of
the
french
line
of
frontier
towns
neither
did
the
duke
use
his
fine
army
of
prussians
or
direct
the
motions
of
the
austrians
under
clairfait
to
any
greater
advantage
he
had
indeed
the
troops
of
the
great
frederick
but
under
the
command
of
an
irresolute
and
incapable
leader
it
was
the
sword
of
scanderbeg
in
the
hands
of
a
boy
this
tardiness
of
the
duke
of
brunswick
movements
intimated
a
latent
doubt
of
his
own
capacity
to
conduct
the
campaign
the
superiority
of
his
veteran
and
finely
disciplined
forces
over
the
disorganized
army
of
dumouriez
reinforced
as
it
was
by
crowds
of
federates
who
were
perfect
strangers
to
war
would
have
been
best
displayed
by
bold
and
rapid
movements
evincing
at
once
activity
and
combination
and
alarming
raw
troops
by
a
sense
of
danger
not
in
front
alone
but
on
every
point
each
day
which
these
new
soldiers
spent
unfought
was
one
step
towards
military
discipline
and
what
is
more
towards
military
confidence
the
general
who
had
threatened
so
hard
seemed
to
suspend
his
blow
in
indecision
and
he
remained
trifling
on
the
frontiers
when
frederick
had
he
been
in
our
front
said
the
french
general
would
long
since
have
driven
us
back
upon
chalons
the
result
of
so
many
false
steps
began
soon
to
appear
brunswick
whose
army
was
deficient
in
battering
guns
though
entering
france
on
a
frontier
of
fortifications
was
arrested
by
the
obstinate
defence
of
thionville
having
at
length
decided
to
advance
he
spent
nine
days
in
marching
thirty
leagues
but
omitted
to
possess
himself
of
the
defiles
of
argonnes
by
which
alone
the
army
of
luckner
could
with
that
of
dumouriez
the
allied
general
now
found
himself
in
the
most
elevated
part
of
the
province
of
champagne
branded
for
its
poverty
and
sterility
with
the
unseemly
name
la
champagne
pouilleuse
where
he
found
difficulty
to
subsist
his
army
meantime
if
corn
and
forage
were
scarce
grapes
and
melons
were
unfortunately
plenty
these
last
fruits
are
so
proverbially
unwholesome
that
the
magistrates
of
liege
and
some
other
towns
forbid
the
peasants
to
bring
them
to
market
under
pain
of
confiscation
it
was
the
first
time
such
delicacies
had
been
presented
to
the
hyperborean
appetites
of
the
prussians
and
they
could
not
resist
the
temptation
though
the
same
penalty
was
annexed
to
the
banquet
as
to
that
which
produced
the
first
transgression
they
ate
and
died
a
fatal
dysentery
broke
out
in
the
camp
which
swept
the
soldiers
away
by
hundreds
in
a
day
sunk
the
spirits
of
the
survivors
and
seems
to
have
totally
broken
the
courage
of
their
commander
two
courses
remained
to
the
embarrassed
general
one
was
to
make
his
way
by
giving
battle
to
the
french
by
attacking
them
in
the
strong
position
which
they
had
been
permitted
to
occupy
notwithstanding
the
ease
with
which
they
might
have
been
anticipated
it
is
true
dumouriez
had
been
very
strongly
reinforced
france
from
all
her
departments
had
readily
poured
forth
many
thousands
of
her
fiery
youth
from
city
and
town
village
and
grange
and
farm
to
protect
the
frontiers
at
once
from
the
invasion
of
foreigners
and
the
occupation
of
thousands
of
vengeful
emigrants
they
were
undisciplined
indeed
but
full
of
zeal
and
courage
heated
and
excited
by
the
scenes
of
the
republic
and
inflamed
by
the
florid
eloquence
the
songs
dances
and
with
which
it
had
been
celebrated
above
all
they
were
of
a
country
which
of
all
others
in
europe
has
been
most
familiar
with
war
and
the
youth
of
which
are
most
easily
rendered
amenable
to
military
discipline
but
to
these
new
levies
the
duke
of
brunswick
might
have
safely
opposed
the
ardent
valour
of
the
emigrants
men
descended
of
families
whose
deeds
of
chivalry
fill
the
registers
of
europe
men
by
whom
the
road
to
paris
was
regarded
as
that
which
was
to
conduct
them
to
victory
to
honour
to
the
rescue

dreadful
by

who
claimed
as
their
military
renown

the
use
of

in
one
skirmish
fifteen
hundred
of
the
emigrant
cavalry
had
defeated
with
great
slaughter
a
column
of
the
carmagnoles
as
the
republican
levies
were
called
they
were
routed
with
great
slaughter
and
their
opponents
had
the
pleasure
to
count
among
the
slain
a
considerable
number
of
the
assassins
of
september
but
the
french
general
had
more
confidence
in
the
carmagnole
levies
from
which
his
military
genius
derived
a
valuable
support
than
brunswick
thought
proper
to
repose
in
the
chivalrous
gallantry
of
the
french
noblesse
he
could
only
be
brought
to
engage
in
one
action
of
artillery
near
valmy
which
was
attended
with
no
marked
consequence
and
then
issued
his
order
for
a
retreat
it
was
in
vain
that
the
comte
with
a
spirit
worthy
of
the
line
from
which
he
was
descended
and
the
throne
to
which
he
has
now
succeeded
entreated
almost
implored
a
recall
of
this
fatal
order
in
vain
that
he
offered
in
person
to
head
the
emigrant
forces
and
to
assume
with
them
the
most
desperate
post
in
the
battle
if
the
generalissimo
would
permit
it
to
be
fought
but
the
duke
obstinate
in
his
desponding
in
proportion
to
his
former
presumption
was
not
of
that
high
mind
which
adopts
hazardous
counsels
in
desperate
cases
he
saw
his
army
mouldering
away
around
him
beheld
the
french
forming
in
his
rear
knew
that
the
resources
of
prussia
were
unequal
to
a
prolonged
war
and
after
one
or
two
feeble
attempts
to
negotiate
for
the
safety
of
the
captive
louis
he
was
at
length
contented
to
accept
an
implied
permission
to
retreat
without
molestation
he
raised
his
camp
on
the
of
september
and
left
behind
him
abundant
marks
of
the
dreadful
state
to
which
his
army
was
reduced
when
we
look
back
on
these
events
and
are
aware
of
dumouriez
real
opinions
and
the
interest
which
he
took
in
the
fate
of
the
king
we
have
little
reason
to
doubt
that
the
duke
of
brunswick
might
by
active
and
prompt
exertions
have
eluded
that
general
defensive
measures
nay
that
judicious
negotiation
might
have
induced
him
on
certain
points
being
conceded
to
have
united
a
part
at
least
of
his
forces
with
those
of
the
emigrants
in
a
march
to
paris
for
the
king
rescue
and
the
punishment
of
the
jacobins
but
had
the
restoration
of
louis
xvi
taken
place
by
the
armed
hand
of
the
emigrants
and
the
allies
the
final
event
of
the
war
must
still
have
been
distant
almost
the
whole
body
of
the
kingdom
was
diametrically
opposed
to
the
restoration
of
the
absolute
monarchy
with
all
its
evils
and
yet
it
must
have
been
the
object
of
the
emigrants
in
case
of
success
again
to
establish
not
only
royalty
in
its
utmost
prerogative
but
all
the
oppressive
privileges
and
feudal
subjections
which
the
revolution
had
swept
away
much
was
to
have
been
dreaded
too
from
the
avidity
of
the
strangers
whose
arms
had
assisted
the
imprisoned
louis
and
much
more
from
what
has
since
been
aptly
termed
the
reaction
which
must
have
taken
place
upon
a
it
was
greatly
to
be
apprehended
that
the
emigrants
always
deeming
too
lightly
of
the
ranks
beneath
them
incensed
by
the
murder
of
their
friends
and
stung
by
their
own
private
wrongs
and
insults
would
if
successful
have
treated
the
revolution
not
as
an
exertion
of
the
public
will
of
france
to
free
the
country
from
public
grievances
but
as
a
which
in
some
of
its
scenes
it
too
much
resembled
a
domestic
treason
of
the
vassals
against
their
liege
lords
it
was
the
will
of
providence
that
the
experience
of
twenty
years
and
upwards
should
make
manifest
that
in
the
hour
of
victory
itself
concessions
to
the
defeated
as
far
as
justice
demands
them
is
the
only
mode
of
deriving
permanent
and
secure
peace
sidenote
emigrant

disbanded
the

of
the
prussians
was
executed
in
the
best
possible
order
and
in
the
most
leisurely
manner
but
if
to
them
it
was
a
measure
of
disgrace
it
was
to
the
unfortunate
emigrants
who
had
joined
their
standard
the
signal
of
utter
despair
and
ruin
these
corps
were
composed
of
gentlemen
who
called
suddenly
and
unprovided
from
their
families
and
homes
had
only
brought
with
them
such
moderate
sums
of
money
as
could
be
raised
in
an
emergency
which
they
had
fondly
conceived
would
be
of
very
brief
duration
they
had
expended
most
of
their
funds
in
providing
themselves
with
horses
arms
and
equipments
some
part
must
have
been
laid
out
in
their
necessary
subsistence
for
they
served
chiefly
at
their
own
expense
and
perhaps
as
might
have
been
expected
among
and
youths
their
slender
funds
had
not
been
managed
with
an
economical
view
of
the
possibility
of
the
reverses
which
had
taken
place
in
the
confusion
and
disorder
of
the
retreat
their
baggage
was
plundered
by
their
auxiliaries
that
is
to
say
by
the
disorderly
prussian
soldiers
who
had
shaken
loose
all
discipline
and
they
were
in
most
cases
reduced
for
instant
maintenance
to
sell
their
horses
at
such
paltry
prices
as
they
could
obtain

of
this
devoted
army
as
had
been
engaged
in

campaign
they
were
disbanded
at
juliers
in
november
the
blindness
of
the
sovereigns
who
still
continuing
a
war
on
france
suffered
such
fine
troops
to
be
dissolved
for
want
of
the
means
of
support
was
inexcusable
their
cold
and
conduct
towards
a
body
of
gentlemen
who
if
politically
wrong
were
at
least
devoted
to
the
cause
for
which
austria
asserted
that
she
continued
in
arms
was
equally
unwise
and
ungenerous
these
gallant
gentlemen
might
have
upbraided
the
kings
who
had
encouraged
and
especially
the
general
who
led
this
expedition
in
the
words
of
shakspeare
if
he
had
been
known
to
them
hast
thou
not
spoke
like
thunder
on
our
side
been
sworn
our
soldier
bidding
us
depend
upon
thy
stars
thy
fortune
and
thy
strength
but
the
reproaches
of
those
who
have
no
remedy
but
the
exposition
of
their
wrongs
seldom
reach
the
ears
of
the
powerful
by
whom
these
wrongs
have
been
committed
it
is
not
difficult
to
conceive
the
agony
with
which
these
banished
gentlemen
abandoned
all
hopes
of
saving
the
life
of
their
king
and
the
recovery
of
their
rank
and
fortune
all
their
proud
vaunts
of
expected
success
were
lost
or
converted
into
serpents
to
sting
them
they
had
no
hope
before
them
and
what
is
worst
to
men
of
high
spirit
they
had
fallen
with
scarce
a
blow
struck
for
honour
far
less
for
victory
they
were
now
doomed
such
as
could
to
exercise
for
mere
subsistence
the
prosecution
of
sciences
and
arts
which
they
had
cultivated
to
adorn
prosperity
to
wander
in
foreign
lands
and
live
upon
the
precarious
charity
of
foreign
powers
embittered
every
where
by
the
reflections
of
some
who
pitied
the
folly
that
could
forfeit
rank
and
property
for
a
mere
point
of
honour
and
of
others
who
saw
in
them
the
enemies
of
rational
liberty
and
upbraided
them
with
the
charge
that
their
misfortunes
were
the
necessary
consequence
of
their
arbitrary
principles
it
might
have
in
some
degree
mitigated
their
calamity
could
some
gifted
sage
have
shown
them
at
such
distance
as
the
legislator
of
israel
beheld
the
promised
land
from
mount
pisgah
the
final
restoration
of
the
royal
house
in
whose
cause
they
had
suffered
shipwreck
of
their
all
but
how
many
perished
in
the
wilderness
of
misfortune
which
intervened
how
few
survived
the
twenty
years
wandering
which
conducted
to
this
promised
point
and
of
those
few
who
and
wearied
by
misfortunes
survived
the
restoration
of
royalty
how
very
few
were
rewarded
by
more
than
the
disinterested
triumph
which
they
felt
on
that
joyful
occasion
and
how
many
might
use
the
simile
of
a
royalist
of
britain
on
a
similar
occasion
the
fleece
of
gideon
remained
dry
while
the
restoration
shed
showers
of
blessing
on
all
france
beside
the
emigrant
regiments
under
the
command
of
the
prince
of
condé
had
another
and
nobler
fate
they
retained
their
arms
and
signalized
themselves
by
their
exertions
were
consumed
by
the
sword
and
in
toils
of
service
and
died
at
least
the
death
of
soldiers
mourned
and
not
unrevenged
but
they
were
wasting
their
devoted
courage
in
the
service
of
foreigners
and
if
their
gallantry
was
gratified
by
the
defeat
of
those
whom
they
regarded
as
the
murderers
of
their
king
and
as
usurpers
of
their
rights
they
might
indeed
feel
that
their
revenge
was
satiated
but
scarce
in
any
sense
could
they
regard
their
victories
as
serviceable
to
the
cause
to
which
they
had
sacrificed
their
country
their
possessions
their
hopes
their
lives
their
fate
though
on
a
much
more
extensive
scale
much
resembles
that
of
the
officers
of
the
scottish
army
in
who
following
the
fortunes
of
james
ii
to
france
were
at
length
compelled
to
form
themselves
into
a
battalion
of
privates

doing
many
feats

gallantry

service

no

who
preferring

to
those

into
courses

may
be
doubtful
in

perhaps
in
patriotism
but
to
which
they
are
urged
by
the
disinterested
wish
of
discharging
what
they
account
a
conscientious
duty
the
emigrants
were
impolitic
perhaps
in
leaving
france
though
that
conduct
had
many
apologies
and
their
entrance
into
their
country
in
arms
to
bring
back
the
despotic
system
which
louis
xvi
and
the
whole
nation
save
themselves
had
renounced
was
an
enterprise
unwisely
and
unjustly
undertaken
but
the
cause
they
embraced
was
one
dear
to
all
the
prejudices
of
the
rank
and
sentiments
in
which
they
had
been
brought
up
their
loyal
purpose
in
its
defence
is
indisputable
and
it
would
be
hard
to
condemn
them
for
following
one
extreme
when
the
most
violent
and
tyrannical
proceedings
were
in
the
sight
of
all
europe
urging
another
so
bloody
black
and
fatal
as
that
of
the
faction
which
now
domineered
in
paris
and
constrained
men
whose
prejudices
of
birth
or
education
were
in
favour
of
freedom
to
loathe
the
very
name
of
france
and
of
the
revolution
the
tame
and
dishonourable
retreat
of
the

his
prussians

elated

courage
of

themselves

against

what
was
equally
formidable

preached
to
their

the
flattering
and

to

sacred

more
decided

grateful
character

had

than

how
to

the
power
of

afterwards
his

the
measures
to
which
he

were
the
constant
subject
of

by
the
parties
who

forced
themselves
into

accused
the

during

time
of
their
brief
sway
of
attempts
to
extend
the
power

the
privileges
of

under

siege

triumphed
over
the
moderates
who
desired
to
afford
the
king
the
shelter
and
bulwark
of
an
intermediate
senate
and
then
after
creating
a
constitution
as
democratical
as
it
could
be
leaving
a
name
and
semblance
of
royalty
they
sunk
under
the
girondists
who
were
disposed
altogether
to
dispense
with
that
symbol
in
this
way
it
appeared
to
the
people
that
the
king
was
their
natural
enemy
and
that
the
royal
interest
was
directly
opposed
to
a
revolution
which
had
brought
them
sundry
advantages
besides
giving
them
the
feelings
and
consequence
of
freemen
in
this
manner
one
of
the
mildest
and
best
disposed
monarchs
that
ever
swayed
a
sceptre
became
exposed
to
general
suspicion
and
misconstruction
in
his
measures
and
as
is
sure
speedily
to
follow
to
personal
contempt
and
even
hatred
whatever
the
king
did
in
compliance
with
the
current
tide
of
revolution
was
accounted
as
fraudful
complaisance
designed
to
blind
the
nation
whatever
opposition
he
made
to
that
powerful
impulse
was
accounted
an
act
of
open
treason
against
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
his
position
with
regard
to
the
invading
powers
was
enough
of
itself
to
load
him
with
obloquy
and
suspicion
it
is
true
that
he
was
called
and
professed
himself
the
willing
king
of
a
popular
or
democratic
monarchy
but
in
the
proclamations
of
his
allies
he
was
described
as
a
monarch
imprisoned
degraded
and
almost
dethroned
to
achieve
his
liberty
as
they
affirmed
and
to
his
rights
the
emperor
his
the
king
of
prussia
his
ally
and
above
all
his
brothers
the
princes
of
the
blood
of
france
were
in
arms
and
had
sent
numerous
armies
to
the
frontiers
it
was
scarcely
possible
in
the
utmost
extent
of
candour
that
the
french
people
should
give
louis
credit
for
desiring
the
success
of
the
revolutionary
cause
by
which
not
only
his
power
had
been
circumscribed
but
his
person
had
been
placed
under
virtual
restraint
against
forces
armed
avowedly
for
his
safety
and
liberty
as
well
as
the
restoration
of
his
power
we
can
allow
as
much
to
the
disinterestedness
of
louis
as
to
any
whose
feelings
and
rights
were
immediately
concerned
with
the
point
at
issue
and
we
admit
that
all
concessions
which
he
made
to
the
popular
cause
before
the
national
assembly
had
asserted
a
paramount
authority
over
his
were
willingly
and
freely
granted
but
after
the
march
from
versailles
he
must
have
been
an
enthusiast
for
public
liberty
of
a
very
uncommon
character
if
we
could
suppose
him
seriously
wishing
the
defeat
of
his
brothers
and
allies
and
the
victory
of
those
who
had
deprived
him
first
of
authority
and
then
of
freedom
a
single
glance
at
his
situation
must
have
convinced
the
people
of
france
that
louis
could
scarcely
be
sincere
in
desiring
the
continuance
of
the
system
to
which
he
had
given
his
adhesion
as
sovereign
and
the
consciousness
that
they
could
not
expect
confidence
where
they
themselves
had
made
ungenerous
use
of
their
power
added
force
to
their
suspicions
and
acrimony
to
the
deep
resentments
which
arose
out
of
them
the
people
had
identified
themselves
and
their
dearest
interests
right
or
wrong
it
signifies
little
to
the
result
with
the
revolution
and
with
the
increasing
freedom
which
it
bestowed
or
rather
promised
to
bestow
in
every
succeeding
change
the
king
who
had
been
the
regular
opponent
of
every
one
of
these
innovations
was
in
consequence
regarded
as
the
natural
enemy
of
the
country
who
if
he
continued
to
remain
at
the
helm
of
the
executive
government
did
so
with
the
sole
view
of
running
the
vessel
upon
the
rocks
if
there
had
been
any
men
in
france
generous
enough
to
give
the
king
credit
for
complete
good
faith
with
the
constitutionalists
his
flight
from
paris
and
the
manifestoes
which
he
left
behind
him
protesting
against
the
measures
in
which
he
had
acquiesced
as
extorted
from
him
by
constraint
gave
open
proof
of
louis
real
feelings
it
is
true
the
king
denied
any
purpose
of
leaving
the
kingdom
or
throwing
himself
into
the
hands
of
the
foreign
powers
but
it
could
escape
no
one
that
such
a
step
however
little
it
was
calculated
upon
in
the
commencement
of
his
flight
might
very
easily
have
become
inevitable
before
its
completion
it
does
not
appear
from
the
behaviour
of
the
escorts
of
dragoons
and
hussars
that
there
was
any
attachment
among
the
troops
to
the
person
and
had
the
mutiny
of
bouillé
forces
against
that
authority
taken
place
after
the
king
reached
the
camp
the
only
safety
of
louis
must
have
been
in
a
retreat
into
the
austrian
territory
this
chance
was
so
evident
that
bouillé
himself
had
provided
for
it
by
requesting
that
the
austrian
forces
might
be
so
disposed
as
to
afford
the
king
protection
should
the
emergency
occur
whatever
therefore
might
be
the
king
first
experiment
the
point
to
which
he
directed
his
flight
bore
out
those
who
supposed
and
asserted
that
it
must
have
ultimately
terminated
in
his
with
his
brothers
and
that
such
a
conclusion
must
have
repeatedly
occurred
to
the
thoughts
but
if
the
king
was
doubted
and
suspected
before
he
gave
this
decisive
proof
of
his
disinclination
to
the
constitution
there
had
surely
happened
nothing
in
the
course
of
his
being
seized
at
varennes
or
the
circumstances
of
his
reception
at
paris
tending
to
reconcile
him
to
the
constitutional
crown
which
was
a
second
time
proffered
him
and
which
he
again
with
all
its
duties
and
acts
of
solemnly
accepted
we
have
before
hinted
that
the
king
assuming
of
new
the
frail
and
barren
sceptre
proffered
to
him
under
the
most
humiliating
circumstances
was
a
piece
of
indifferent
policy
there
occurred
almost
no
course
of
conduct
by
which
subjected
as
he
was
to
general
suspicion
he
could
show
himself
once
more
to
his
people
in
a
clear
and
impartial
point
of
view
each
of
his
measures
was
sure
to
be
the
theme
of
the
most
malignant
commentary
if
his
conduct
assumed
a
popular
aspect
it
was
accounted
an
act
of
princely
hypocrisy
if
it
was
like
his
opposition
to
the
departmental
army
it
would
have
been
held
as
intended
to
weaken
the
defence
of
the
country
if
it
resembled
his
rejection
of
the
decrees
against
the
emigrants
and
refractory
priests
then
it
might
be
urged
as
inferring
a
direct
intention
of
bringing
back
the
old
despotic
system
in
short
all
confidence
was
lost
between
the
sovereign
and
the
people
from
a
concurrence
of
unhappy
circumstances
in
which
it
would
certainly
be
unjust
to
cast
the
blame
exclusively
on
either
party
since
there
existed
so
many
grounds
for
distrust
and
misunderstanding
on
both
sides
the
noble
and
generous
confidence
which
frenchmen
had
been
wont
to
repose
in
the
personal
character
of
their
monarch
a
confidence
which
the
probity
of
no
man
could
deserve
more
than
that
of
louis
was
withered
root
and
branch
or
those
in
whose
breasts
it
still
flourished
were
banished
men
and
had
carried
the
oriflamme
and
the
ancient
spirit
of
french
chivalry
into
a
camp
not
her
own
the
rest
of
the
nation
a
scattered
and
intimidated
remnant
of
royalists
excepted
were
constitutionalists
who
friends
rather
to
the
crown
than
to
the
king
as
an
individual
wished
to
preserve
the
form
of
government
but
without
either
zeal
or
attachment
to
louis
or
girondists
who
detested
his
office
as
republicans
or
jacobins
who
hated
his
person
every
one
therefore
assailed
louis
and
it
was
held
enrolling
himself
amongst
aristocrats
the
most
avowed
and
hated
enemies
of
the
new
order
of
things
if
any
one
lifted
a
voice
in
his
defence
or
even
apology
to
this
the
influence
of
the
revolutionary
clubs
amounting
to
so
many
thousands
and
of
the
daily
press
almost
the
only
kind
of
literature
which
france
had
left
added
the
full
tribute
of
calumny
and
inculpation
the
jacobins
attacked
the
person
of
the
king
from
the
very
commencement
of
the
revolution
for
they
desired
that
louis
should
be
destroyed
even
when
some
amongst
them
were
leagued
for
placing
orleans
in
his
room
the
girondists
on
the
contrary
would
have
been
well
contented
to
spare
the
person
of
louis
but
they
urged
argument
after
argument
in
the
journal
which
they
directed
against
the
royal
office
but
upon
the
whole
the
king
whether
in
his
royal
or
personal
character
had
been
so
long
and
uniformly
calumniated
and
misinterpreted
that
through
most
parts
of
france
he
was
esteemed
the
enemy
whom
the
people
had
most
to
dread
and
whom
they
were
most
interested
to
get
rid
of
in
evidence
of
which
it
may
be
added
that
during
all
successive
changes
of
parties
for
the
next
year
or
two
the
charge
of
a
disposition
towards
royalty
was
always
made
an
aggravation
of
the
accusations
which
the
parties
brought
against
each
other
and
was
considered
as
so
necessary
an
ingredient
that
it
was
not
omitted
even
when
circumstances
rendered
it
impossible
sidenote
abolition
of
royalty
both
parties
in
the
convention
were
thus
prepared
to
acquire
popularity
by
gratifying
the
almost
universal
prejudices
against
monarchy
and
against
the
king
the
girondists
constant
to
the
republican
principles
they
entertained
had
resolved
to
abolish
the
throne
but
their
audacious
rivals
were
prepared
to
go
a
step
beyond
them
by
gratifying
the
popular
spirit
of
vengeance
which
their
own
calumnies
had
increased
to
such
a
pitch
by
taking
the
life
of
the
dethroned
monarch
this
was
the
great
national
crime
which
was
to
serve
france
for
a
republican
baptism
and
which
once
committed
was
to
be
regarded
as
an
act
of
definitive
and
deadly
adhesion
to
the
cause
of
the
revolution
but
not
contented
with
taking
measures
for
the
death
of
the
monarch
this
desperate
but
active
faction
resolved
to
anticipate
their
rivals
in
the
proposal
for
the
abolition
of
royalty
the
girondists
who
counted
much
on
the
popularity
which
they
were
to
attain
by
this
favourite
measure
were
so
far
from
fearing
the
anticipation
of
the
jacobins
that
under
the
idea
of
orleans
having
some
interest
remaining
with
danton
and
others
they
rather
expected
some
opposition
on
their
part
but
what
was
their
surprise
and
mortification
when
on
the
september
manuel
arose
and
demanded
that
one
of
the
first
proposals
submitted
to
the
convention
should
be
the
abolition
of
royalty
ere
the
girondists
could
recover
from
their
surprise
collot
a
sorry
comedian
who
had
been
hissed
from
the
stage
desired
the
motion
to
be
instantly
put
to
the
vote
the
girondists
anticipated
in
their
scheme
had
no
resource
left
but
to
be
clamorous
in
applauding
the
motion
lest
their
hesitation
should
bring
their
republican
zeal
into
question
thus
all
they
could
do
was
but
to
save
their
credit
with
the
popular
party
at
a
time
when
they
had
expected
to
increase
it
to
such
a
height
their
antagonists
had
been
so
alert
as
to
steal
the
game
out
of
their
hands
the
violence
with
which
the
various
orators
expressed
themselves
against
monarchy
of
every
complexion
and
kings
in
general
was
such
as
to
show
either
that
they
were
in
no
state
of
mind
composed
enough
to
decide
on
a
great
national
measure
or
that
the
horrors
of
the
massacres
scarce
ten
days
remote
impressed
on
them
the
danger
of
being
lukewarm
in
the
cause
of
the
sovereign
people
who
were
not
only
judges
without
resort
but
the
prompt
executioners
of
their
own
decrees
the
abbé
grégoire
declared
that
the
dynasties
of
kings
were
a
race
of
devouring
animals
who
fed
on
the
blood
of
the
people
and
that
kings
were
in
the
moral
order
of
things
what
monsters
are
in
the
physical
that
courts
were
the
arsenals
of
crimes
and
the
centre
of
corruption
and
that
the
history
of
princes
was
the
martyrology
of
the
people
finally
that
all
the
members
of
the
convention
being
fully
sensible
of
these
truths
it
was
needless
to
delay
even
for
a
moment
the
vote
of
abolition
reserving
it
to
more
leisure
to
put
their
declaration
into
better
form
ducos
exclaimed
that
the
crimes
of
louis
alone
formed
a
sufficient
reason
for
the
abolition
of
monarchy
the
motion
was
received
and
passed
unanimously
and
each
side
of
the
hall
anxious
to
manifest
their
share
in
this
great
measure
echoed
back
to
the
other
the
new
of
vive

republique
thus
fell
at
the
voice
of
a
wretched
player
and
backed
by
that
of
a
renegade
priest
the
most
ancient
and
most
distinguished
monarchy
of
europe
a
few
remarks
may
be
permitted
upon
the
new
government
the
adoption
of
which
had
been
welcomed
with
so
much
gratulation
sidenote
new
system
of
government
it
has
been
said
that
the
government
which
is
best
administered
is
best
this
maxim
is
true
for
the
time
but
for
the
time
only
as
good
administration
depends
often
on
the
life
of
individuals
or
other
circumstances
in
themselves
mutable
one
would
rather
incline
to
say
that
the
government
is
best
calculated
to
produce
the
happiness
of
a
nation
which
is
best
adapted
to
the
existing
state
of
the
country
which
it
governs
and
possesses
at
the
same
time
such
internal
means
of
regeneration
as
may
enable
it
to
keep
pace
with
the
changes
of
circumstances
and
accommodate
itself
to
the
unavoidable
alterations
which
must
occur
in
a
progressive
state
of
society
in
this
point
of
view
and
even
in
the
patriarchal
circle
the
most
natural
forms
of
government
in
the
early
periods
of
society
are
monarchy
or
a
republic
the
father
is
head
of
his
own
family
the
assembled
council
of
the
fathers
governs
the
republic
or
the
of
the
whole
state
is
bestowed
upon
some
successful
warrior
or
eminent
legislator
who
becomes
king
of
the
tribe
but
a
republic
in
the
literal
acceptation
which
supposes
all
the
individuals
subject
to
its
government
to
be
consulted
in
council
upon
all
affairs
of
the
public
can
not
survive
the
most
early
period
of
existence
it
is
only
to
be
found
around
the
of
a
north
american
tribe
of
indians
and
even
there
the
old
men
forming
a
sort
of
senate
have
already
established
a
species
of
aristocracy
as
society
advances
and
the
little
state
extends
itself
ordinary
matters
of
government
are
confided
to
delegates
or
exclusively
grasped
by
some
of
the
higher
orders
of
the
community
rome
when
she
dismissed
the
tarquins
the
period
to
which
the
girondists
were
fond
of
assimilating
that
of
the
french
revolution
had
already
a
privileged
body
of
patricians
the
senate
from
which
were
exclusively
chosen
the
consuls
until
at
a
later
period
and
at
the
expense
of
many
feuds
with
the
patricians
the
plebeians
succeeded
in
obtaining
for
their
order
many
advantages
but
the
state
of
rome
was
not
more
republican
in
the
proper
sense
than
before
these
concessions
the
corporate
citizens
of
rome
were
indeed
admitted
into
some
of
the
privileges
of
the
nobles
but
the
quantity
of
territory
and
of
population
over
which
these
citizens
extended
their
dominion
was
so
great
that
the
rural
and
unrepresented
part
of
the
inhabitants
quite
outnumbered
that
of
the
citizens
who
voted
in
the
comitia
and
constituted
the
source
of
authority
there
was
the
whole
body
of
slaves
who
neither
were
nor
could
be
represented
being
considered
by
the
law
as
no
farther
capable
of
political
or
legal
rights
than
a
herd
of
so
many
cattle
and
there
were
the
numerous
and
extensive
dominions
over
which
under
the
name
of
auxiliaries
rome
exercised
a
right
of
absolute
sovereignty
in
fact
the
so
called
democracy
was
rather
an
oligarchy
dispersed
more
widely
than
usual
and
vesting
the
government
of
an
immense
empire
in
a
certain
limited
number
of
the
inhabitants
of
rome
called
citizens
bearing
a
very
small
proportion
in
bulk
to
the
gross
number
of
the
inhabitants
these
privileged
persons
in
some
degree
lived
upon
their
votes
the
ambitious
caressed
them
fed
them
caught
their
eyes
with
magnificent
exhibitions
and
their
ears
with
extravagant
eloquence
and
by
corrupting
their
principles
at
last
united
the
small
class
of
privileged
citizens
themselves
under
the
very
bondage
in
which
they
had
long
kept
their
extensive
empire
there
is
no
one
period
of
the
roman
republic
in
which
it
can
be
said
considering
the
number
of
the
persons
governed
relatively
to
those
who
had
as
citizens
a
share
of
that
government
by
vote
or
capacity
of
bearing
office
that
the
people
as
a
whole
were
fairly
and
fully
represented
all
other
republics
of
which
we
have
any
distinct
account
including
the
celebrated
states
of
greece
were
of
so
small
a
size
that
it
was
by
no
means
difficult
to
consult
the
citizens
to
a
considerable
extent
in
the
affairs
of
the
state
still
this
right
of
being
consulted
was
retained
among
the
citizens
of
greece
slaves
who
amounted
to
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
inhabitants
were
never
permitted
any
interference
there
more
than
in
rome
now
as
it
was
by
slaves
that
the
coarser
more
debasing
and
more
sordid
parts
of
the
labour
of
the
community
were
performed
there
were
thus
excluded
from
the
privilege
of
citizens
almost
all
those
who
by
constant
toil
and
by
the
sordid
character
of
the
employments
to
which
their
fate
condemned
them
might
be
supposed
incapable
of
exercising
political
rights
with
due
feelings
of
reflection
and
of
independence
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
in
conclusion
that
excepting
in
the
earliest
stage
of
human
society
there
never
existed
a
community
in
which
was
to
be
found
that
liberty
and
equality
which
the
french
claimed
for
each
individual
in
the
whole
extent
of
their
empire
not
only
the
difficulty
or
impossibility
of
assigning
to
every
person
in
france
an
equal
portion
of
political
power
was
one
against
which
antiquity
had
never
attempted
to
struggle
but
the
wealth
and
size
of
the
late
french
empire
were
circumstances
which
experience
induced
wise
statesmen
to
conclude
against
the
favourable
issue
of
the
experiment
those
memorable
republics
which
montesquieu
eulogizes
as
being
formed
upon
as
the
leading
principle
inhabited
the
modest
and
sequestered
habitations
where
virtue
is
most
often
found
in
mountainous
countries
like
those
of
the
swiss
where
the
inhabitants
are
nearly
of
the
same
rank
and
not
very
much
disproportioned
in
substance
and
where
they
inhabit
a
small
district
or
territory
a
republic
seems
the
most
natural
form
of
government
nature
has
to
a
certain
extent
established
an
equality
among
the
fathers
of
such
a
society
and
there
is
no
reason
why
policy
should
supplant
it
in
their
public
meetings
they
come
together
upon
the
same
general
footing
and
possess
nearly
the
same
opportunity
of
forming
a
judgment
and
the
affairs
of
such
a
state
are
too
little
complicated
to
require
frequent
or
prolonged
discussions
the
same
applies
to
small
states
like
genoa
and
some
of
the
dutch
provinces
where
the
inequality
of
wealth
if
it
exists
in
some
instances
is
qualified
by
the
consideration
that
it
is
gained
in
the
same
honourable
pursuit
of
mercantile
traffic
where
all
fortunes
are
founded
on
the
same
commercial
system
and
where
the
chance
that
has
made
one
man
rich
yesterday
may
depress
him
and
raise
another
under
such
favourable
circumstances
republics
may
exist
long
and
happy
providing
they
can
prevent
luxury
from
working
the
secret
dissolution
of
their
moral
principles
or
the
exterior
force
of
more
powerful
neighbours
from
swallowing
up
their
little
community
in
the
rage
of
conquest
america
must
certainly
be
accounted
a
successful
attempt
to
establish
a
republic
on
a
much
larger
scale
than
those
we
have
mentioned
but
that
great
and
flourishing
empire
consists
it
must
be
remembered
of
a
federative
union
of
many
states
which
though
extensive
in
territory
are
comparatively
thin
in
occupants
there
do
not
exist
in
america
in
the
same
degree
those
circumstances
of
a
dense
and
degraded
population
which
occasion
in
the
old
nations
of
europe
such
an
infinite
difference
of
knowledge
and
ignorance
of
wealth
the
most
exuberant
and
indigence
the
most
horrible
no
man
in
america
need
be
poor
if
he
has
a
hatchet
and
arms
to
use
it
the
wilderness
is
to
him
the
same
retreat
which
the
world
afforded
to
our
first
parents
his
family
if
he
has
one
is
wealth
if
he
is
unencumbered
with
wife
or
children
he
is
the
more
easily
provided
for
a
man
who
wishes
to
make
a
large
fortune
may
be
disappointed
in
america
but
he
who
seeks
with
a
moderate
degree
of
industry
only
the
wants
which
nature
demands
is
certain
to
find
them
an
immense
proportion
of
the
population
of
the
united
states
consists
of
agriculturists
who
live
upon
their
own
property
which
is
generally
of
moderate
extent
and
cultivate
it
by
their
own
labour
such
a
situation
is
peculiarly
favourable
to
republican
habits
the
man
who
feels
himself
really
independent
and
so
must
each
american
who
can
use
a
spade
or
an
axe
will
please
himself
with
the
mere
exertion
of
his
freewill
and
form
a
strong
contrast
to
the
hollowing
bawling
blustering
rabble
of
a
city
where
a
dram
of
liquor
or
the
money
to
buy
a
meal
is
sure
to
purchase
the
acclamation
of
thousands
whose
situation
in
the
scale
of
society
is
too
low
to
permit
their
thinking
of
their
political
right
as
a
thing
more
valuable
than
to
be
bartered
against
the
degree
of
advantage
they
may
procure
or
of
a
license
which
they
may
exercise
by
placing
it
at
the
disposal
of
one
candidate
or
another
above
all
before
considering
the
case
of
america
as
parallel
with
that
of
france
the
statesmen
of
the
latter
country
should
have
observed
one
grand
and
radical
difference
in
america
after
the
great
change
in
their
system
had
been
effected
by
shaking
off
the
sovereignty
of
the
mother
country
the
states
arranged
their
new
government
so
as
to
make
the
least
possible
alteration
in
the
habits
of
their
people
they
left
to
a
future
and
more
convenient
opportunity
what
farther
innovation
this
great
change
might
render
necessary
being
more
desirous
to
fix
the
general
outlines
of
a
firm
and
orderly
government
although
containing
some
anomalies
than
to
cast
all
existing
authorities
loose
in
order
that
they
might
produce
a
constitution
more
regular
in
theory
but
far
less
likely
to
be
put
into
effectual
execution
than
those
old
forms
under
which
the
people
had
grown
up
and
to
which
they
were
accustomed
to
render
regular
obedience
they
abolished
no
nobility
for
they
had
none
in
the
colonies
to
abolish
but
in
fixing
the
basis
of
their
constitution
they
balanced
the
force
and
impulse
of
the
representative
body
of
the
states
by
a
senate
designed
to
serve
the
purposes
answered
by
the
house
of
lords
in
the
british
constitution
the
governors
of
the
different
states
also
in
whose
power
the
executive
administration
of
each
was
reposed
continued
to
exercise
the
same
duties
as
before
without
much
other
change
than
that
they
were
named
by
their
instead
of
being
appointed
by
the
sovereign
of
the
mother
country
the
congress
exercised
the
rights
which
success
had
given
them
over
the
loyalists
with
as
much
temperance
as
could
be
expected
after
the
rage
of
a
civil
war
above
all
the
mass
of
the
american
population
was
in
a
sound
healthy
state
and
well
fitted
to
bear
their
share
in
the
exercise
of
political
rights
they
were
independent
as
we
have
noticed
and
had
comparatively
few
instances
amongst
them
of
great
wealth
contrasted
with
the
most
degrading
indigence
they
were
deeply
imbued
with
a
sense
of
religion
and
the
morality
which
is
its
fruit
they
had
been
brought
up
under
a
free
government
and
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights
of
freemen
and
their
fancies
were
not
liable
to
be
excited
or
their
understandings
made
giddy
with
a
sudden
elevation
to
privileges
the
nature
of
which
was
unknown
to
them
the
republic
of
america
moreover
did
not
consist
of
one
huge
and
populous
country
with
an
overgrown
capital
where
the
legislative
body
cooped
up
in
its
precincts
like
prisoners
were
liable
to
be
acted
upon
by
the
applauses
or
threats
of
a
desperate
rabble
each
state
of
america
carries
on
its
own
immediate
government
and
enjoys
unmolested
the
privilege
of
adopting
such
plans
as
are
best
suited
to
their
own
peculiar
situation
without
embarrassing
themselves
with
that
ideal
uniformity
that
universal
equality
of
rights
which
it
was
the
vain
object
of
the
french
constituent
assembly
to
establish
the
americans
know
that
the
advantage
of
a
constitution
like
that
of
a
garment
consists
neither
in
the
peculiarity
of
the
fashion
nor
in
the
fineness
of
the
texture
but
in
its
being
well
adapted
to
the
person
who
receives
protection
from
it
in
short
the
sagacity
of
washington
was
not
more
apparent
in
his
military
exploits
than
in
the
manly
and
wise
pause
which
he
made
in
the
march
of
revolution
so
soon
as
peace
gave
an
opportunity
to
interrupt
its
impulse
to
replace
law
and
social
order
upon
an
established
basis
was
as
much
the
object
of
this
great
general
as
it
seems
to
have
been
that
of
the
statesmen
of
paris
civilians
as
they
were
to
protract
a
period
of
insurrection
murder
and
revolutionary
tyranny
sidenote
france
a
republic
to
such
peculiarities
and
advantages
as
those
we
have
above
stated
france
opposed
a
direct
contrast
not
only
was
the
exorbitant
influence
of
such
a
capital
as
paris
a
bar
to
the
existence
of
that
republican
virtue
which
is
the
essence
of
a
popular
form
of
government
but
there
was
nothing
like
fixed
or
settled
principles
in
the
minds
of
the
people
of
france
at
large
every
thing
had
within
the
last
few
years
been
studiously
and
industriously
altered
from
the
most
solemn
rites
of
the
church
of
rome
to
the
most
trifling
article
of
dress
from
the
sacrament
of
the
mass
to
the
fashion
of
a
religion
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
and
the
very
slightest
vestiges
of
an
established
church
were
about
to
be
demolished
republican
virtue
with
the
exception
of
that
of
the
soldiers
whose
valour
did
honour
to
the
name
consisted
in
wearing
a
coarse
dress
and
foul
linen
swearing
the
most
vulgar
oaths
obeying
without
scruple
the
most
villanous
mandates
of
the
jacobin
club
and
assuming
the
title
manner
and
sentiments
of
a
real
the
country
was
besides
divided
into
an
infinite
variety
of
factions
and
threatened
with
the
plague
of
civil
war
the
streets
of
the
metropolis
had
been
lately
the
scene
of
a
desperate
conflict
and
yet
more
recently
of
a
horrible
massacre
on
the
frontiers
the
country
was
pressed
by
armies
of
invaders
it
was
a
crisis
in
which
the
romans
with
all
their
love
of
freedom
would
have
called
in
the
assistance
of
a
dictator
yet
it
was
then
when
without
regarding
either
the
real
wants
of
the
country
or
the
temper
of
its
inhabitants
france
was
erected
into
a
republic
a
species
of
government
the
most
inconsistent
with
energetic
secret
and
successful
councils
these
considerations
could
not
have
escaped
the
girondists
neither
could
they
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
each
republic
whatever
its
pretensions
to
freedom
has
committed
to
some
high
officer
of
the
state
under
the
name
of
doge
stadtholder
president
or
other
title
the
custody
of
the
executive
power
from
the
obvious
and
undeniable
principle
that
with
safety
to
freedom
it
can
not
be
lodged
in
the
hands
of
the
legislative
body
but
knowing
this
to
be
the
case
they
dared
not
even
hint
that
such
a
separation
of
powers
was
indispensable
aware
that
their
fierce
enemies
the
jacobins
while
they
would
have
seized
on
the
office
without
scruple
would
with
the
other
hand
sign
an
accusation
of
against
them
for
proposing
it
thus
crude
raw
and
ill
considered
did
one
of
the
most
important
changes
that
could
be
wrought
upon
a
country
pass
as
hastily
through
this
legislative
body
as
the
change
of
a
decoration
in
the
theatre
the
alteration
was
notwithstanding
hailed
by
the
community
at
large
as
the
consummation
of
the
high
fortunes
to
which
france
was
called
true
half
europe
was
in
arms
at
her
gates
but
the
nation
who
opposed
their
swords
to
them
were
become
republicans
true
the
most
frightful
disorder
had
stalked
abroad
in
the
shape
of
armed
slaughter
it
was
but
the
effervescence
and
delirium
of
a
republican
consciousness
of
freedom
peculation
had
crept
into
the
finance
and
theft
had
fingered
the
diamonds
of
the
state
but
the
name
of
a
republic
was
of
itself
sufficient
to
restore
to
the
blackest
jacobin
of
the
gang
the
moral
virtues
of
a
cincinnatus
the
mere
word
was
now
the
universal
medicine
for
all
evils
which
france
could
complain
of
and
its
regenerating
operations
were
looked
for
with
as
much
faith
and
confidence
as
if
the
salutary
effects
of
the
convocation
of
the
estates
of
the
kingdom
once
worshipped
as
a
panacea
with
similar
expectations
had
not
deceived
the
hopes
of
the
country
meantime
the
actors
in
the
new
drama
began
to
play
the
part
of
romans
with
the
most
ludicrous
solemnity
the
name
of
was
now
the
universal
salutation
to
all
classes
even
when
a
deputy
spoke
to
a
that
fond
symbol
of
equality
was
regularly
exchanged
betwixt
them
and
in
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
society
there
was
the
most
ludicrous
affectation
of
republican
brevity
and
simplicity
when
thou
conquerest
brussels
said
collot
the
actor
to
general
dumouriez
my
wife
who
is
in
that
city
has
my
permission
to
reward

weeks
afterwards
the
general
took
brussels
but
he
was
ungallant
enough
not
to
profit
by
this
flattering
permission
his
quick
wit
caught
the
ridicule
of
such
an
ejaculation
as
that
which
camus
addressed
to
him
said
the
deputy
thou
dost
meditate
the
part
of
cæsar
but
remember
i
will
be
brutus
and
plunge
a
poniard
in
thy
bosom
my
dear
camus
said
the
lively
soldier
who
had
been
in
worse
dangers
than
were
involved
in
this
classical
threat
i
am
no
more
like
cæsar
than
you
are
like
brutus
and
an
assurance
that
i
should
live
till
you
kill
me
would
be
equal
to
a
brevet
of
immortality
with
a
similar
assumption
of
republican
dignity
men
graced
their
children
baptized
or
unbaptized
with
the
formidable
names
of
roman
heroes
and
the
folly
of
anacharsis
clootz
seemed
to
become
general
throughout
the
nation
republican
virtues
were
of
course
adopted
or
affected
the
duty
of
mothers
nursing
their
own
children
so
eloquently
insisted
on
by
rousseau
and
nevertheless
so
difficult
to
practise
under
the
forms
of
modern
life
was
generally
adopted
in
paris
and
as
the
ladies
had
no
idea
that
this
process
of
parental
attention
was
to
interfere
with
the
usual
round
of
entertainment
mothers
with
their
infants
dressed
in
the
most
approved
roman
costume
were
to
be
seen
at
the
theatre
with
the
little
disastrous
victims
of
republican
affectation
whose
wailings
as
well
as
other
embarrassments
occasioned
by
their
presence
formed
sometimes
disagreeable
interruptions
to
the
amusements
of
the
evening
and
placed
the
inexperienced
matrons
in
an
awkward
situation
these
were
follies
to
be
laughed
at
but
when
men
read
livy
for
the
sake
of
discovering
what
degree
of
private
crime
might
be
committed
under
the
mask
of
public
virtue
the
affair
became
more
serious
the
deed
of
the
younger
brutus
served
any
man
as
an
apology
to
betray
to
ruin
and
to
death
a
friend
or
a
patron
whose
patriotism
might
not
be
of
the
pitch
which
suited
the
time
under
the
example
of
the
elder
brutus
the
nearest
ties
of
blood
were
repeatedly
made
to
give
way
before
the
ferocity
of
party
zeal
a
zeal
too
often
assumed
for
the
most
infamous
and
selfish
purposes
as
some
fanatics
of
yore
studied
the
old
testament
for
the
purpose
of
finding
examples
of
bad
actions
to
vindicate
those
which
themselves
were
tempted
to
commit
so
the
republicans
of
france
we
mean
the
desperate
and
outrageous
bigots
of
the
revolution
read
history
to
justify
by
classical
instances
their
public
and
private
crimes

scourges
of

urged
as
indispensable
the

the
supreme
charge

the
temptations

out
by
these
fearful
innovations
on
the
state

the
girondists
themselves
did
not
scruple
to
avail
themselves
of
the
villany
of
others
when
what
they
called
the
cause
of
the
country
in
reality
that
of
their
own
faction
could
be
essentially
served
by
it
but
it
was
reserved
for
the
jacobins
to
carry
to
the
most
hideous
extremity
the
principle
which
made
an
exclusive
idol
of
patriotism
and
demanded
that
every
other
virtue
as
well
as
the
most
tender
and
honourable
dictates
of
feeling
and
conscience
should
be
offered
up
at
the
shrine
of
the
republic
as
children
were
of
old
made
to
pass
through
the
fire
to
moloch
sidenote
sacrilege
of
saint

another
eruption
of
republican
zeal

directed
against
the
antiquities

name
of

being
pronounced
detestable
all
the
remembrances
of
royalty
were
on
the
motion
of
barrère
ordered
to
be
destroyed
this
task
was
committed
to
the
rabble
and
although
a
work
dishonourable
to
their
employers
and
highly
detrimental
both
to
history
and
the
fine
arts
it
was
nevertheless
infinitely
more
harmless
than
those
in
which
the
same
agents
had
been
lately
employed
the
royal
sepulchres
at
saint

near
paris
the
ancient
cemetery
of
the
bourbons

valois

all
the
long

of
french
monarchs

not

defaced
on
the
outside

utterly
broken
down
the
bodies

the
poor

long

the
rude
gaze

grasp
of
the
banditti

committed
the

the
courage
to
interpose
for
preventing
the
total
dispersion
of
the
materials
of
those
monuments
so
valuable
to
history
and
to
literature
he
procured
with
difficulty
permission
to
preserve
and
collect
them
in
a
house
and
garden
in
the
des
petits
where
their
mutilated
remains
continued
in
safety
till
after
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
the
enterprise
was
accomplished
at
much
personal
risk
for
if
the
people
he
had
to
deal
with
had
suspected
that
the
zeal
which
he
testified
for
the
preservation
of
the
monuments
was
rather
that
of
a
royalist
than
of
an
antiquary
his
idolatry
would
have
been
punished
by
instant
death
but
the
demolition
of
those
ancient
and
sacred
monuments
was
comparatively
a
trivial
mode
of
showing
hatred
to
royalty
the
vengeance
of
the
republicans
was
directed
against
the
emigrants
who
armed
or
unarmed
or
from
whatever
cause
they
were
absent

now
to
be
at
once
confounded

foreigners

had
quitted

of

contrary
to
the

subjected
to
the

penalty
all

in
foreign
parts
were
banished
for
ever

their
native
country

the

of

in
misfortune
was
yet
visible
on
the
walls
the
refractory
priests
were
particularly
the
objects
of
this
species
of
oppression
and
at
length
a
summary
decree
was
made
for
transporting
them
in
the
mass
from
the
land
of
france
to
the
unhealthy
colony
of
guiana
in
south
america
many
of
these
unfortunate
men
came
to
a
more
speedy
fate
but
the
most
august
victims
destined
to
be
sacrificed
at
the
altar
of
republican
virtue
were
the
royal
family
in
the
temple
whose
continuing
in
existence
seemed
doubtless
to
the
leaders
a
daily
reproach
to
their
procrastination
and
an
object
to
which
when
the
present
spirit
should
abate
the
affections
of
the
bewildered
people
might
return
with
a
sort
of
reaction
the
jacobins
resolved
that
louis
should
die
were
it
only
that
the
world
might
see
they
were
not
ashamed
to
attest
with
a
bloody
seal
the
truth
of
the
accusations
they
had
brought
against
him
on
the
other
hand
there
was
every
reason
to
hope
that
the
girondists
would
exert
in
protection
of
the
unhappy
prince
whatever
vigour
they
derived
from
their
predominating
influence
in
the
convention
they
were
most
of
them
men
whose
philosophy
though
it
had
driven
them
on
wild
political
speculations
had
not
destroyed
the
sense
of
moral
right
and
wrong
especially
now
that
the
struggle
was
ended
betwixt
monarchy
and
democracy
and
the
only
question
remaining
concerned
the
use
to
be
made
of
their
victory
although
they
had
aided
the
attack
on
the
tuileries
on
the
of
august
which
they
considered
as
a
combat
their
hands
were
unstained
with
the
massacres
of
september
which
as
we
shall
presently
see
they
urged
as
an
atrocious
crime
against
their
rivals
the
jacobins
besides
they
had
gained
the
prize
and
were
in
possession
of
the
government
and
like
the
constitutionalists
before
them
the
girondists
now
desired
that
here
at
length
the
revolutionary
career
should
terminate
and
that
the
ordinary
forms
of
law
and
justice
should
resume
their
usual
channels
through
france
yielding
to
the
people
protection
for
life
personal
liberty
and
private
property
and
affording
themselves
who
held
the
reins
of
government
the
means
of
guiding
these
honourably
safely
and
with
advantage
to
the
community
the
philosophical
statesmen
upon
whom
these
considerations
were
not
lost
felt
nevertheless
great
embarrassment
in
the
mode
of
interposing
their
protection
in
the
king
favour
their
republicanism
was
the
feature
on
which
they
most
prided
themselves
they
delighted
to
claim
the
share
in
the
downfall
of
louis
which
was
due
to
their
colleague
barbaroux
and
the
federates
of
marseilles
and
brest
it
was
upon
their
accession
to
this
deed
that
the
girondists
rested
their
claims
to
popularity
and
with
what
front
could
they
now
step
forward
the
defenders
at
the
least
the
apologists
of
the
king
whom
they
had
aided
to
dethrone
or
what
advantages
would
not
the
jacobins
obtain
over
them
when
they
represented
them
to
the
people
as
lukewarm
in
their
zeal
and
as
falling
off
from
the
popular
cause
in
order
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
dethroned
tyrant
the
girondist
ministers
felt
these
embarrassments
and
suffered
themselves
to
be
intimidated
by
them
from
making
any
open
manly
and
direct
interference
in
the
king
cause
sidenote
madame
roland
a
woman
and
although
a
woman
not
the
least
distinguished
among
the
girondist
party
had
the
courage
to
urge
a
decisive
and
vigorous
defence
of
the
unhappy
prince
without
having
recourse
to
the
veil
of
a
selfish
and
insidious
policy
this
was
the
wife
of
roland
one
of
the
most
remarkable
women
of
her
time
a
worthless
at
least
a
careless
father
and
the
doating
folly
of
her
mother
had
left
her
when
young
to
pick
out
such
an
education
as
she
could
among
the
indecencies
and
impieties
of
french
philosophy
yet
though
her
memoirs
afford
revolting
specimens
of
indelicacy
and
exaggerated
sentiments
in
politics
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
tenor
of
her
life
was
innocent
and
virtuous
in
practice
and
her
sentiments
unperverted
when
left
to
their
natural
course
she
saw
the
great
question
in
its
true
and
real
position
she
saw
that
it
was
only
by
interposing
themselves
betwixt
the
legislative
body
of
france
and
the
commission
of
a
great
crime
that
the
girondists
could
either
remain
firm
in
the
government
attract
the
confidence
of
honest
men
of
any
description
or
have
the
least
chance
of
putting
a
period
to
the
anarchy
which
was
devouring
their
country
save
the
life
of
louis
she
said
save
him
by
an
open
and
avowed
defence
it
is
the
only
measure
that
can
assure
your
safety
the
only
course
which
can
fix
the
stamp
of
public
virtue
on
your
government
those
whom
she
addressed
listened
with
admiration
but
like
one
who
has
rashly
climbed
to
a
height
where
his
brain
grows
giddy
they
felt
their
own
situation
too
tottering
to
permit
their
reaching
a
willing
hand
to
support
another
who
was
in
still
more
imminent
peril
their
condition
was
indeed
precarious
a
large
party
in
the
convention
avowedly
supported
them
and
in
as
it
was
called
a
position
held
by
deputies
affecting
independence
both
of
the
girondists
and
the
jacobins
and
therefore
occupying
the
neutral
ground
betwixt
them
sate
a
large
number
who
from
the
timidity
of
temper
which
makes
sheep
and
other
weak
animals
herd
together
in
numbers
had
formed
themselves
into
a
faction
which
could
at
any
time
cast
decision
into
either
scale
which
they
favoured
but
they
exercised
this
power
of
inclining
the
balance
less
with
a
view
to
carrying
any
political
point
than
with
that
of
securing
their
own
safety
in
ordinary
debates
they
usually
gave
their
votes
to
the
ministers
both
because
they
were
ministers
and
also
because
the
milder
sentiments
of
the
girondists
were
more
congenial
to
the
feelings
of
men
who
would
gladly
have
seen
peace
and
order
restored
but
then
these
timid
members
of
the
plain
also
assiduously
courted
the
jacobins
avoided
joining
in
any
measure
which
should
give
them
mortal
offence
and
purchased
a
sort
of
immunity
from
their
revenge
by
showing
plainly
that
they
deserved
only
contempt
in
this
neutral
party
the
gleanings
of
the
defeated
factions
of
moderates
and
of
constitutionalists
were
chiefly
to
be
found
resigning
themselves
to
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
consulting
their
own
safety
as
they
gave
their
votes
and
waiting
perhaps
till
less
disorderly
days
might
restore
to
them
the
privilege
of
expressing
their
actual
sentiments
the
chief
of
these
trucklers
to
fortune
was
barrère
a
man
of
wit
and
eloquence
prompt
invention
supple
opinions
and
convenient
conscience
his
terror
of
the
jacobins
was
great
and
his
mode
of
disarming
their
resentment
so
far
as
he
and
the
neutral
party
were
concerned
was
often
very
ingenious
when
by
argument
or
by
eloquence
the
girondists
had
obtained
some
triumph
in
the
assembly
which
seemed
to
reduce
their
adversaries
to
despair
it
was
then
barrère
and
the
members
of
threw
themselves
between
the
victors
and
vanquished
and
by
some
proposal
of
an
insidious
and
neutralizing
nature
prevented
the
completion
of
the
conquest
and
afforded
a
safe
retreat
to
the
defeated
the
majorities
therefore
which
the
girondists
obtained
in
the
assembly
being
partly
eked
out
by
this
heartless
and
fluctuating
band
of
auxiliaries
could
never
be
supposed
to
arm
them
with
solid
or
effective
authority
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
they
should
exhibit
such
a
power
of
protecting
themselves
and
those
who
should
join
them
as
might
plainly
show
that
the
force
was
on
their
side
this
point
once
established
they
might
reckon
barrère
and
his
party
as
faithful
adherents
but
while
the
jacobins
retained
the
power
of
surrounding
the
convention
at
their
pleasure
with
an
insurrection
of
the
suburbs
without
the
deputies
possessing
other
means
of
defence
than
arose
out
of
their
inviolability
the
adherence
of
those
whose
chief
object
in
voting
was
to
secure
their
personal
safety
was
neither
to
be
hoped
nor
expected
the
girondists
therefore
looked
anxiously
round
to
secure
if
it
were
possible
the
possession
of
such
a
force
to
protect
themselves
and
their
timorous
allies
sidenote
danton
robespierre
marat
it
has
been
thought
that
a
more
active
more
artful
body
of
ministers
and
who
were
better
acquainted
with
the
mode
of
carrying
on
revolutionary
movements
might
at
this
period
have
secured
an
important
auxiliary
by
detaching
the
formidable
danton
from
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
and
receiving
him
into
their
own
it
must
be
observed
that
the
camp
of
the
jacobins
contained
three
separate
parties
led
each
by
one
of
the
triumvirs
whom
we
have
already
described
and
acting
in
concert
for
the
common
purpose
of
propelling
the
revolution
by
the
same
violent
means
which
had
begun
it
of
unsheathing
the
sword
of
terror
and
making
it
pass
for
that
of
justice
and
in
the
name
of
liberty

letting

and
spoil
under
the
protection
of
armed
ruffians
of
the
basest
condition
continue
to
waste
and
ravage
the
departments
of
france
but
although
agreed
in
this
main
object
the
triumvirs
were
extremely
suspicious
of
each
other
and
jealous
of
the
rights
each
might
claim
in
the
spoil
which
they
contemplated

robespierre
for
his
cowardice
robespierre
feared
the
ferocious
audacity
of
danton
and
with
him
to
fear
was
to
hate
and
to
hate
was
when
the
hour
arrived
to
destroy
they
differed
in
their
ideas
also
of
the
mode
of
exercising
their
terrible
system
of
government
danton
had
often
in
his
mouth
the
sentence
of
machiavel
that
when
it
becomes
necessary
to
shed
blood
a
single
great
massacre
has
a
more
dreadful
effect
than
a
series
of
successive
executions
robespierre
on
the
contrary
preferred
the
latter
process
as
the
best
way
of
sustaining
the
reign
of
terror
the
appetite
of
marat
could
not
be
satiated
but
by
combining
both
modes
of
murder
both
danton
and
robespierre
kept
aloof
from
the
sanguinary
marat
this
position
of
the
chiefs
of
the
jacobins
towards
each
other
seemed
to
indicate
that
one
of
the
three
at
least
might
be
detached
from
the
rest
and
might
bring
his
ruffians
in
opposition
to
those
of
his
late
comrades
in
case
of
any
attempt
on
the
assembly
and
policy
recommended
danton
not
averse
it
is
said
to
the
alliance
as
the
most
useful
auxiliary
sidenote
marat
among
the
three
monsters
mentioned
danton
had
that
energy
which
the
girondists
wanted
and
was
well
acquainted
with
the
secret
movements
of
those
insurrections
to
which
they
possessed
no
key
his
vices
of
wrath
luxury
love
of
spoil
dreadful
as
they
were
are
attributes
of
mortal
men
the
envy
of
robespierre
and
the
instinctive
of
marat
were
the
properties
of
fiends
danton
like
the
huge
serpent
called
the
boa
might
be
approached
with
a
degree
of
safety
when
gorged
with
prey
but
the
appetite
of
marat
for
blood
was
like
the
which
says
not
enough
and
the
slaughterous
envy
of
robespierre
was
like
the
gnawing
worm
that
dieth
not
and
yields
no
interval
of
repose
in
glutting
danton
with
spoil
and
furnishing
the
means
of
indulging
his
luxury
the
girondists
might
have
purchased
his
support
but
nothing
under
the
supreme
rule
in
france
would
have
gratified
robespierre
and
an
unlimited
torrent
of
the
blood
of
that
unhappy
country
could
alone
have
satiated
marat
if
a
colleague
was
to
be
chosen
out
of
that
detestable
triumvirate
unquestionably
danton
was
to
be
considered
as
the
most
eligible
on
the
other
hand
men
like
brissot
vergniaud
and
others
whose
attachment
to
republicanism
was
mixed
with
a
spirit
of
virtue
and
honour
might
be
well
adverse
to
the
idea
of
contaminating
their
party
with
such
an
auxiliary
intensely
stained
as
danton
was
by
his
share
in
the
massacres
of
september
they
might
well
doubt
whether
any
physical
force
which
his
revolutionary
skill
and
the
arms
it
could
put
in
motion
might
bring
to
their
standard
would
compensate
for
the
moral
horror
with
which
the
presence
of
such
a
grisly
proselyte
must
strike
all
who
had
any
sense
of
honour
or
justice
they
therefore
discouraged
the
advances
of
danton
and
resolved
to
comprise
him
with
marat
and
robespierre
in
the
impeachment
against
the
jacobin
chiefs
which
they
designed
to
bring
forward
in
the
assembly
the
most
obvious
means
by
which
the
girondists
could
ascertain
their
safety
and
the
freedom
of
debate
was
by
levying
a
force
from
the
several
departments
each
contributing
its
quota
to
be
called
a
departmental
legion
which
was
to
be
armed
and
paid
to
act
as
a
guard
upon
the
national
convention
the
subject
was
introduced
by
roland
in
a
report
to
the
assembly
and
renewed
on
the
next
day
by
kersaint
a
spirited
girondist
who
candidly
declared
the
purpose
of
his
motion
it
was
time
he
said
that
assassins
and
their
prompters
should
see
that
the
law
had
scaffolds
the
girondists
obtained
that
a
committee
of
six
members
should
be
named
to
report
on
the
state
of
the
capital
on
the
encouragement
afforded
to
massacre
and
on
the
mode
of
forming
a
departmental
force
for
the
defence
of
the
metropolis
the
decree
was
carried
for
a
moment
but
on
the
next
day
the
jacobins
demanded
that
it
should
be
revoked
denying
that
there
was
any
occasion
for
such
a
defence
to
the
convention
and
accusing
the
ministers
of
an
intention
to
surround
themselves
with
a
force
of
armed
satellites
in
order
to
overawe
the
good
city
of
paris
and
carry
into
effect
their
sacrilegious
plan
of
dismembering
france
rebecqui
and
barbaroux
replied
to
this
charge
by
impeaching
robespierre
on
their
own
testimony
of
aspiring
to
the
post
of
dictator
the
debate
became
more
tempestuous
the
more
that
the
tribunes
or
galleries
of
the
hall
were
filled
with
the
violent
followers
of
the
jacobin
party
who
shouted
cursed
and
yelled
to
back
the
exclamations
and
threats
of
their
leaders
in
the
assembly
while
the
girondists
were
exhausting
themselves
to
find
out
terms
of
reproach
for
marat
that
prodigy
stepped
forth
and
raised
the
disorder
to
the
highest
by
avowing
himself
the
author
and
advocate
for
a
dictatorship
the
anger
of
the
convention
seemed
thoroughly
awakened
and
vergniaud
read
to
the
deputies
an
extract
from
marat
journal
in
which
after
demanding
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
heads
which
was
his
usual
stint
he
abused
the
convention
in
the
grossest
terms
and
exhorted
the
people
to
act
words
of
which
the
import
was
by
this
time
perfectly
understood
this
passage
excited
general
horror
and
the
victory
for
a
moment
seemed
in
the
hands
of
the
girondists
but
they
did
not
pursue
it
with
sufficient
vigour
the
meeting
passed
to
the
order
of
the
day
and
marat
in
ostentatious
triumph
produced
a
pistol
with
which
he
said
he
would
have
blown
out
his
brains
had
a
decree
of
accusation
been
passed
against
him
the
girondists
not
only
lost
the
advantage
of
discomfiting
their
enemies
by
the
prosecution
of
one
of
their
most
noted
leaders
but
were
compelled
for
the
present
to
abandon
their
plan
of
a
departmental
guard
and
resign
themselves
to
the
guardianship
of
the
faithful
citizens
of
paris
this
city
of
paris
was
at
the
time
under
the
power
of
the
intrusive
community
or
common
council
many
of
whom
had
forced
themselves
into
office
on
the
of
august
it
was
the
first
act
of
their
administration
to
procure
the
assassination
of
mandat
the
commandant
of
the
national
guard
and
their
accompts
still
extant
bear
testimony
that
it
was
by
their
instrumentality
that
the
murderers
of
september
were
levied
and
paid
trained
jacobins
and
pitiless
ruffians
themselves
this
civic
body
had
raised
to
be
their
agents
and
assistants
an
unusual
number
of
municipal
officers
who
were
at
once
their
guards
their
informers
their
spies
their
jailors
and
their
executioners
they
had
besides
obtained
a
majority
of
the
inhabitants
in
most
of
the
sections
whose
votes
placed
them
and
their
agents
in
command
of
the
national
guard
and
the
pikemen
of
the
suburbs
were
always
ready
to
second
their
excellent
community
even
against
the
convention
itself
which
in
point
of
freedom
of
action
or
effective
power
made
a
figure
scarcely
more
respectable
than
that
of
the
king
after
his
return
from
varennes
roland
almost
every
day
carried
to
the
convention
his
vain
complaints
that
the
course
of
the
law
for
which
he
was
responsible
was
daily
crossed
thwarted
and
impeded
by
the
proceedings
of
this
usurping
body
the
considerable
funds
of
the
city
itself
with
those
of
its
hospitals
and
other
public
establishments
of
every
kind
were
dilapidated
by
these
revolutionary
intruders
and
applied
to
their
own
purposes
the
minister
at
length
in
a
formal
report
to
the
convention
inculpated
the
commune
in
these
and
such
like
offences
in
another
part
of
the
report
he
intimated
a
plot
of
the
jacobins
to
assassinate
the
girondists
possess
themselves
of
the
government
by
arms
and
choose
robespierre
dictator
louvet
denounced
robespierre
as
a
traitor
and
barbaroux
proposed
a
series
of
decrees
the
first
declaring
the
convention
free
to
leave
any
city
where
they
should
be
exposed
to
constraint
and
violence
the
second
resolving
to
form
a
conventional
guard
the
third
declaring
that
the
convention
should
form
itself
into
a
court
of
justice
for
trial
of
state
crimes
the
fourth
announcing
that
in
respect
the
sections
of
paris
had
declared
their
sittings
permanent
that
resolution
should
be
abrogated
instead
of
adopting
the
energetic
measures
proposed
by
barbaroux
the
convention
allowed
robespierre
eight
days
for
his
defence
against
louvet
accusation
and
ordered
to
the
bar
ten
members
of
the
community
from
whom
they
were
contented
to
accept
such
slight
apologies
and
evasive
excuses
for
their
unauthorised
interference
with
the
power
of
the
convention
as
these
insolent
demagogues
condescended
to
offer
the
accusation
of
robespierre
though
boldly
urged
by
louvet
and
barbaroux
was
also
eluded
by
passing
to
the
order
of
the
day
and
thus
the
convention
showed
plainly
that
however
courageous
they
had
been
against
their
monarch
they
dared
not
protect
the
liberty
which
they
boasted
of
against
the
encroachment
of
fiercer
demagogues
than
themselves
barbaroux
endeavoured
to
embolden
the
assembly
by
bringing
once
more
from
his
native
city
a
body
of
those
fiery
marseillois
who
had
formed
the
vanguard
of
the
mob
on
the
of
august
he
succeeded
so
far
in
his
scheme
that
a
few
scores
of
those
federates
again
appeared
in
paris
where
their
altered
demeanour
excited
surprise
their
songs
were
again
chanted
their
wild
moresco
dances
and
gestures
again
surprised
the
parisians
and
the
more
as
in
their
choruses
they
imprecated
vengeance
on
the
jacobins
called
out
for
mercy
to
the
poor
tyrant
so
they
termed
the
king
and
shouted
in
the
cause
of
peace
order
and
the
convention
the
citizens
of
paris
who
could
not
reconcile
the
songs
and
exclamations
of
the
marseillois
with
their
appearance
and
character
concluded
that
a
snare
was
laid
for
them
and
abstained
from
uniting
themselves
with
men
whose
sincerity
was
so
suspicious
the
marseillois
themselves
discouraged
with
their
cold
reception
or
not
liking
their
new
trade
of
maintaining
order
so
well
as
their
old
one
of
oversetting
it
melted
away
by
degrees
and
were
soon
no
more
seen
nor
heard
of
some
of
the
breton
federates
kept
in
the
interest
of
the
girondists
by
their
countrymen
the
deputies
kersaint
and
kervclagan
remained
still
attached
to
the
convention
though
their
numbers
were
too
few
to
afford
them
protection
in
any
general
danger
if
the
memoirs
of
dumouriez
are
to
be
relied
on
that
active
and
intriguing
general
presented
to
the
girondists
another
resource
not
free
certainly
from
hazard
or
difficulty
to
the
republican
government
which
was
the
idol
of
these
theoretical
statesmen
but
affording
if
his
means
had
proved
adequate
to
the
execution
of
his
plans
a
certain
bulwark
against
the
encroachments
of
the
hideous
anarchy
threatened
by
the
jacobin
ascendency
sidenote
dumouriez
proposal
general
dumouriez
was
sufficiently
hated
by
the
jacobins
notwithstanding
the
successes
which
he
had
gained
on
the
part
of
france
over
foreign
enemies
to
induce
him
to
feel
the
utmost
desire
of
putting
down
their
usurped
power
but
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
acting
with
great
caution
the
bad
success
of
la
fayette
deserted
by
his
army
as
soon
as
he
attempted
to
lead
them
against
paris
was
in
itself
discouraging
but
dumouriez
was
besides
conscious
that
the
jacobin
clubs
together
with
the
commissioners
of
the
convention
with
danton
at
their
head
had
been
actively
engaged
in
disorganizing
his
army
and
diminishing
his
influence
over
them
thus
circumstanced
he
naturally
resolved
to
avoid
hazarding
any
violent
measure
without
the
support
of
the
convention
in
case
of
being
deserted
by
his
army
but
he
affirms
that
he
repeatedly
informed
the
girondists
then
predominant
in
the
assembly
that
if
they
could
obtain
a
decree
but
of
four
lines
authorising
such
a
measure
he
was
ready
to
march
to
paris
at
the
head
of
a
chosen
body
of
troops
who
would
have
been
willing
to
obey
such
a
summons
and
that
he
would
by
this
means
have
placed
the
convention
in
a
situation
when
they
might
have
set
the
jacobins
and
their
insurrectionary
forces
at
absolute
defiance
perhaps
the
girondists
entertained
the
fear
first
that
influence
with
his
troops
might
prove
as
inefficient
as
that
of
la
fayette
and
leave
them
to
atone
with
their
heads
for
such
a
measure
attempted
and
unexecuted
or
secondly
that
if
the
manœuvre
proved
successful
they
would
be
freed
from
fear
of
the
jacobins
only
to
be
placed
under
the
restraint
of
a
military
chief
whose
mind
was
well
understood
to
be
in
favour
of
monarchy
of
one
kind
or
other
so
that
conceiving
they
saw
equal
risk
in
the
alternative
they
preferred
the
hazard
of
seeing
their
fair
and
favourite
vision
of
a
republic
overthrown
by
the
pikes
of
the
jacobins
rather
than
by
the
bayonets
of
dumouriez
army
they
turned
therefore
a
cold
ear
to
the
proposal
which
afterwards
they
would
gladly
have
accepted
when
the
general
had
no
longer
the
power
to
carry
it
into
execution
thus
the
factions
so
intimately
united
for
the
destruction
of
royalty
could
not
when
that
step
was
gained
combine
for
any
other
purpose
save
the
great
crime
of
murdering
their
deposed
sovereign
nay
while
the
jacobins
and
girondists
seemed
moving
hand
in
hand
to
the
ultimate
completion
of
that
joint
undertaking
the
union
was
only
in
outward
appearance
for
the
girondists
though
apparently
acting
in
concert
with
their
stern
rivals
were
in
fact
dragged
after
them
by
compulsion
and
played
the
part
less
of
actors
than
subdued
captives
in
this
final
triumph
of
democracy
they
were
fully
persuaded
of
the
king
innocence
as
a
man
of
his
inviolability
and
exemption
from
criminal
process
as
a
constitutional
authority
they
were
aware
that
the
deed
meditated
would
render
france
odious
to
all
the
other
nations
of
europe
and
that
the
jacobins
to
whom
war
and
confusion
were
natural
elements
were
desirous
for
that
very
reason
to
bring
louis
to
the
scaffold
all
this
was
plain
to
them
and
yet
their
pride
as
philosophers
made
them
ashamed
to
be
thought
capable
of
interesting
themselves
in
the
fate
of
a
tyrant
and
their
desire
of
getting
the
french
nation
under
their
own
exclusive
government
induced
them
to
consent
to
any
thing
rather
than
protect
the
obnoxious
though
innocent
sovereign
at
the
hazard
of
losing
their
popularity
and
forfeiting
their
dearly
won
character
of
being
true
republicans
a
committee
of
persons
had
been
appointed
early
in
the
session
of
the
convention
to
inquire
into
and
report
upon
the
grounds
for
accusing
louis
their
report
was
brought
up
on
the
of
november
and
a
more
loathsome
tissue
of
confusion
and
falsehood
never
was
laid
upon
the
table
of
such
an
assembly
all
acts
that
had
been
done
by
the
ministers
in
every
department
which
could
be
twisted
into
such
a
shape
as
the
times
called
criminal
were
charged
as
deeds
for
which
the
sovereign
was
himself
responsible
and
the
burden
of
the
whole
was
to
accuse
the
king
when
he
had
scarcely
a
single
regiment
of
guards
even
at
his
nominal
disposal
of
nourishing
the
intention
of
massacring
the
convention
defended
by
thirty
thousand
national
guards
besides
the
federates
and
the
militia
of
the
suburbs
sidenote
documents
of
the
iron
chest
the
convention
were
rather
ashamed
of
this
report
and
would
scarce
permit
it
to
be
printed
so
soon
as
it
appeared
two
or
three
persons
who
were
therein
mentioned
as
accomplices
of
particular
acts
charged
against
the
king
contradicted
the
report
upon
their
oath
an
additional
charge
was
brought
under
the
following
mysterious
circumstances
gamin
a
locksmith
of
versailles
communicated
to
roland
about
the
latter
end
of
december
that
in
the
beginning
of
may
he
had
been
employed
by
the
king
to
secrete
an
iron
chest
or
cabinet
in
the
wall
of
a
certain
apartment
in
the
tuileries
which
he
disclosed
to
the
ministers
of
justice
he
added
a
circumstance
which
throws
discredit
on
his
whole
story
namely
that
the
king
gave
him
with
his
own
hand
a
glass
of
wine
after
taking
which
he
was
seized
with
a
cholic
followed
by
a
kind
of
paralysis
which
deprived
him
for
months
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
and
the
power
of
working
for
his
bread
the
inference
of
the
wretch
was
that
the
king
had
attempted
to
poison
him
which
those
may
believe
who
can
number
fourteen
months
betwixt
the
beginning
of
may
and
the
end
of
december
in
the
same
year
this
gross
falsehood
utterly
destroys
gamin
evidence
and
as
the
king
always
denied
his
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
such
a
chest
with
such
papers
we
are
reduced
to
suppose
either
that
gamin
had
been
employed
by
one
of
the
royal
ministers
and
had
brought
the
king
personally
into
the
tale
for
the
greater
grace
of
his
story
or
that
the
papers
found
in
some
other
place
of
safety
had
been
selected
and
put
into
the
chest
by
the
jacobin
commissioners
then
employed
in
surveying
and
searching
the
palace
with
the
purpose
of
trumping
up
evidence
against
the
king
roland
acted
very
imprudently
in
examining
the
contents
of
the
chest
alone
and
without
witness
instead
of
calling
in
the
commissioners
aforesaid
who
were
in
the
palace
at
the
time
this
was
perhaps
done
with
the
object
of
putting
aside
such
papers
as
might
in
that
hour
of
fear
and
uncertainty
have
brought
into
danger
some
of
his
own
party
or
friends
one
of
importance
however
was
found
which
the
jacobins
turned
into
an
implement
against
the
girondists
it
was
an
overture
from
that
party
addressed
to
louis
shortly
before
the
of
august
engaging
to
oppose
the
motion
for
his
forfeiture
providing
louis
would
recall
to
his
councils
the
three
discarded
ministers
of
their
faction
the
contents
of
the
chest
were
of
a
very
miscellaneous
nature
the
documents
consisted
of
letters
memorials
and
plans
from
different
persons
and
at
different
dates
offering
advice
or
tendering
support
to
the
king
and
proposing
plans
for
the
freedom
of
his
person
the
royalist
project
of
mirabeau
in
his
latter
days
was
found
amongst
the
rest
in
consequence
of
which
his
body
was
dragged
out
of
the
pantheon
formerly
the
church
of
saint
genevieve
now
destined
to
receive
the
bodies
of
the
great
men
of
the
revolution
but
whose
lodgings
shifted
as
often
as
if
they
had
been
taken
by
the
month
the
documents
as
we
have
said
consisted
chiefly
of
projects
for
the
king
service
which
he
certainly
never
acted
on
probably
never
approved
of
and
perhaps
never
saw
the
utmost
to
which
he
could
be
liable
was
such
penalty
as
may
be
due
to
one
who
retains
possession
of
plans
submitted
to
his
consideration
but
which
have
in
no
shape
obtained
his
assent
it
was
sufficiently
hard
to
account
louis
responsible
for
such
advice
of
his
ministers
as
he
really
adopted
but
it
was
a
dreadful
extension
of
his
responsibility
to
make
him
answerable
for
such
as
he
had
virtually
rejected
besides
which
the
story
of
gamin
was
so
in
one
circumstance
and
so
doubtful
in
others
as
to
carry
no
available
proof
that
the
papers
had
been
in
the
king
possession
so
that
this
new
charge
was
as
groundless
as
those
brought
up
by
the
first
committee
and
arguing
upon
the
known
law
of
any
civilized
country
the
accusations
against
him
ought
to
have
been
dismissed
as
founded
on
the
most
notorious
injustice
sidenote
charles
i
and
louis
xvi
there
was
one
circumstance
which
probably
urged
those
into
whose
hands
louis
had
fallen
to
proceed
against
his
person
to
the
uttermost
they
knew
that
in
english
history
a
king
had
been
condemned
to
death
by
his
subjects
and
were
resolved
that
france
should
not
remain
behind
england
in
the
exhibition
of
a
spectacle
so
interesting
and
edifying
to
a
people
newly
regenerated
this
parallel
case
would
not
perhaps
have
been
thought
a
worthy
precedent
in
other
countries
but
in
france
there
is
a
spirit
of
wild
enthusiasm
a
desire
of
following
out
an
example
even
to
the
most
exaggerated
point
and
of
outdoing
if
possible
what
other
nations
have
done
before
them
this
had
doubtless
its
influence
in
causing
louis
to
be
brought
to
the
bar
in
like
charles
of
england
in
the
french
statesmen
did
not
pause
to
reflect
that
the
violent
death
of
charles
only
paved
the
way
for
a
series
of
years
spent
in
servitude
under
military
despotism
and
then
to
restoration
of
the
legitimate
sovereign
had
they
regarded
the
precedent
on
this
side
they
would
have
obtained
a
glimpse
into
futurity
and
might
have
presaged
what
were
to
be
the
consequences
of
the
death
of
louis
neither
did
the
french
consider
that
by
a
great
part
of
the
english
nation
the
execution
of
charles
stuart
is
regarded
as
a
national
crime
and
the
anniversary
still
observed
as
a
day
of
fasting
and
penitence
that
others
who
condemn
the
king
conduct
in
and
preceding
the
civil
war
do
like
the
whig
churchill
still
consider
his
death
as
an
unconstitutional
action
that
the
number
is
small
indeed
who
think
it
justifiable
even
on
the
precarious
grounds
of
state
necessity
and
that
it
is
barely
possible
a
small
portion
of
enthusiasts
may
still
exist
who
glory
in
the
deed
as
an
act
of
popular
vengeance
but
even
among
this
last
description
of
persons
the
french
regicides
would
find
themselves
entirely
at
a
loss
to
vindicate
the
execution
of
louis
by
the
similar
fate
of
charles
and
it
would
be
by
courtesy
only
if
at
all
that
they
could
be
admitted
to
the
honours
of
a
sitting
at
a
club
the
comparison
between
these
unhappy
monarchs
fails
in
almost
every
point
excepting
in
the
closing
scene
and
no
parallel
can
with
justice
to
either
be
drawn
betwixt
them
the
most
zealous
cavalier
will
in
these
enlightened
days
admit
that
the
early
government
of
charles
was
marked
by
many
efforts
to
extend
the
prerogative
beyond
its
legal
bounds
that
there
were
instances
of
oppressive
fines
cruel
punishment
by
mutilation
long
and
severe
imprisonments
in
distant
forts
and
castles
exertions
of
authority
which
no
one
seeks
to
justify
and
which
those
who
are
the
king
apologists
can
only
endeavour
to
mitigate
by
alleging
the
precedents
of
arbitrary
times
or
the
interpretation
of
the
laws
by
courtly
ministers
and
lawyers
the
conduct
of
louis
from
the
hour
he
assumed
the
throne
was
on
the
contrary
an
example
of
virtue
and
moderation
instead
of
levying
and
benevolences
louis
lightened
the
feudal
services
of
the
vassals
and
the
among
the
peasantry
where
charles
endeavoured
to
enforce
conformity
to
the
church
of
england
by
pillory
and
louis
allowed
the
protestants
the
free
use
of
their
religion
and
discharged
the
use
of
torture
in
all
cases
whatever
where
charles
visited
his
parliament
to
violate
their
freedom
by
arresting
five
of
their
members
louis
may
be
said
to
have
surrendered
himself
an
unresisting
prisoner
to
the
representatives
of
the
people
whom
he
had
voluntarily
summoned
around
him
but
above
all
charles
in
person
or
by
his
generals
waged
a
long
and
bloody
war
with
his
subjects
fought
battles
in
every
county
of
england
and
was
only
overcome
and
made
prisoner
after
a
lengthened
and
deadly
contest
in
which
many
thousands
fell
on
both
sides
the
conduct
of
louis
was
in
every
respect
different
he
never
offered
one
blow
in
actual
resistance
even
when
he
had
the
means
in
his
power
he
ordered
up
indeed
the
forces
under
maréchal
broglio
but
he
gave
them
command
to
retire
so
soon
as
it
was
evident
that
they
must
either
do
so
or
act
offensively
against
the
people
in
the
most
perilous
situations
of
his
life
he
showed
the
utmost
reluctance
to
shed
the
blood
of
his
subjects
he
would
not
trust
his
attendants
with
pistols
during
the
flight
to
varennes
he
would
not
give
the
officer
of
hussars
orders
to
clear
the
passage
when
his
carriage
was
stopped
upon
the
bridge
when
he
saw
that
the
martial
array
of
the
guards
did
not
check
the
audacity
of
the
assailants
on
the
of
august
he
surrendered
himself
to
the
legislative
assembly
a
prisoner
at
discretion
rather
than
mount
his
horse
and
place
himself
at
the
head
of
his
faithful
troops
and
subjects
the
blood
that
was
shed
that
day
was
without
command
of
his
he
could
have
no
reason
for
encouraging
such
a
strife
which
far
from
defending
his
person
then
in
the
custody
of
the
assembly
was
likely
to
place
it
in
the
most
imminent
danger
and
in
the
very
last
stage
when
he
received
private
notice
that
there
were
individuals
determined
to
save
his
life
at
peril
of
their
own
he
forbade
the
enterprise
let
not
a
drop
of
blood
be
shed
on
my
account
he
said
i
would
not
consent
to
it
for
the
safety
of
my
crown
i
never
will
purchase
mere
life
at
such
a
rate
these
were
sentiments
perhaps
fitter
for
the
pious
sectaries
of
the
community
of
friends
than
for
the
king
of
a
great
nation
but
such
as
they
were
louis
felt
and
conscientiously
acted
on
them
and
yet
his
subjects
could
compare
his
character
and
his
pretended
guilt
with
the
bold
and
haughty
stuart
who
in
the
course
of
the
civil
war
bore
arms
in
person
and
charged
at
the
head
of
his
own
regiment
of
guards
viewed
in
his
kingly
duty
the
conduct
of
louis
is
equally
void
of
blame
unless
it
be
that
blame
which
attaches
to
a
prince
too
yielding
and
mild
to
defend
the
just
rights
of
his
crown
he
yielded
with
feeble
struggling
to
every
demand
in
succession
which
was
made
upon
him
and
gave
way
to
every
inroad
on
the
existing
state
of
france
instead
of
placing
himself
as
a
barrier
between
his
people
and
his
nobility
and
bringing
both
to
some
fair
terms
of
composition
he
suffered
the
latter
to
be
driven
from
his
side
and
by
the
ravaging
their
estates
and
the
burning
of
their
houses
to
be
hurried
into
emigration
he
adopted
one
popular
improvement
after
another
each
innovating
on
the
royal
authority
or
derogatory
to
the
royal
dignity
far
from
having
deserved
the
charge
of
opposing
the
nation
claim
of
freedom
it
would
have
been
well
for
themselves
and
him
had
he
known
how
to
limit
his
grant
to
that
quantity
of
freedom
which
they
were
qualified
to
make
a
legitimate
use
of
leaving
it
for
future
princes
to
slacken
the
reins
of
government
in
proportion
as
the
public
mind
in
france
should
become
formed
to
the
habitual
exercise
of
political
rights
sidenote
preparations
for
the
king
trial
the
king
perfect
innocence
was
therefore
notorious
to
the
whole
world
but
especially
to
those
who
now
usurped
the
title
of
arraigning
him
and
men
could
hardly
persuade
themselves
that
his
life
was
seriously
in
danger
an
ingenious
contrivance
of
the
jacobins
seems
to
have
been
intended
to
drive
the
wavering
girondists
into
the
snare
of
voting
for
the
king
trial
saint
just
one
of
their
number
made
a
furious
speech
against
any
formality
being
observed
save
a
decree
of
death
on
the
urgency
of
the
occasion
what
availed
said
the
supporters
of
this
brief
and
sure
measure
the
ceremonies
of
grand
and
petty
jury
the
cannon
which
made
a
breach
in
the
tuileries
the
unanimous
shout
of
the
people
on
the
of
august
had
come
in
place
of
all
other
solemnities
the
convention
had
no
farther
power
to
inquire
its
sole
duty
was
to
pronounce
or
rather
confirm
and
execute
the
doom
of
the
sovereign
people
this
summary
proposal
was
highly
applauded
not
only
by
the
furious
crowds
by
whom
the
galleries
were
always
occupied
but
by
all
the
exaggerations
of
the
more
violent
democrats
they
exclaimed
that
every
citizen
had
the
same
right
over
the
life
of
louis
which
brutus
possessed
over
that
of
cæsar
others
cried
out
that
the
very
fact
of
having
reigned
was
in
itself
a
crime
notorious
enough
to
dispense
with
further
investigation
and
authorise
instant
punishment
stunned
by
these
clamours
the
girondists
and
neutral
party
like
all
men
chose
a
middle
course
and
instead
of
maintaining
the
king
innocence
adopted
measures
calculated
to
save
him
indeed
from
immediate
slaughter
but
which
ended
by
consigning
him
to
a
tribunal
too
timid
to
hear
his
cause
justly
they
resolved
to
urge
the
right
of
the
national
convention
to
judge
in
the
case
of
louis
there
were
none
in
the
convention
who
dared
to
avow
facts
to
which
their
conscience
bore
witness
but
the
consequences
of
admitting
which
were
ingeniously
urged
by
the
sophist
robespierre
as
a
condemnation
of
their
own
conduct
one
party
said
the
wily
logician
must
be
clearly
guilty
either
the
king
or
the
convention
who
have
ratified
the
actions
of
the
insurgent
people
if
you
have
dethroned
an
innocent
and
legal
monarch
what
are
you
but
traitors
and
why
sit
you
here
why
not
hasten
to
the
temple
set
louis
at
liberty
install
him
again
in
the
tuileries
and
beg
on
your
knees
for
a
pardon
you
have
not
merited
but
if
you
have
in
the
great
popular
act
which
you
have
ratified
only
approved
of
the
deposition
of
a
tyrant
summon
him
to
the
bar
and
demand
a
reckoning
for
his
crimes
this
dilemma
pressed
on
the
mind
of
many
members
who
could
not
but
see
their
own
condemnation
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
king
acquittal
and
while
some
felt
the
force
of
this
argument
all
were
aware
of
the
obvious
danger
to
be
encountered
from
the
wrath
of
the
jacobins
and
their
satellites
should
they
dare
to
dissent
from
the
vote
which
these
demagogues
demanded
from
the
assembly
when
robespierre
had
ended
pétion
arose
and
moved
that
the
king
should
be
tried
before
the
convention
it
is
said
the
mayor
of
paris
took
the
lead
in
this
cruel
persecution
because
louis
had
spoken
to
him
sharply
about
the
tumultuary
inroad
of
the
jacobin
rabble
into
the
tuileries
on
the
of
june
and
when
pétion
attempted
to
reply
had
pointed
to
the
broken
grating
through
which
the
entrance
had
been
forced
and
sternly
commanded
him
to
be
silent
if
this
was
true
it
was
a
bitter
revenge
for
so
slight
an
offence
and
the
subsequent
fate
of
pétion
is
the
less
deserving
of
pity
the
motion
was
carried
without
opposition
and
the
next

affords
us

was

with

the

which
he
paid
to
the
different
parties
he
successively
joined

afterwards
deserted
were
less
the
effect

an
evil
disposition

of
a
timid

a

we

yet
they
were
also
hated

already

should
have
known
that

give

would
only
be
regarded
as
a
timid
indecision
which
must
have
heated
their
enemies
in
proportion
as
it
cooled
their

the
truckling
policy
which
they
observed
on
this
occasion
deprived
the

all

the

steeled
jailor
accustomed
as
he
is
to
scenes
of
distress
is
not
in
the
habit
unprovoked
and
wantonly
of
answering
with
reproach
and
insult
such
ordinary
expressions
of
civility
when
offered
by
the
worst
criminals
the
hearts
of
these
men
who
by
chance
as
it
were
became
and
whose
first
captive
had
been
many
years
their
king
must
have
been
as
hard
as

such
scenes
occurred

who

might
see

ghastly
spectacle

not
the
other
of
milder
mood
prevented
them
from
complying

by

less
savage
persons

wished
to
punish

offending

would
only
mention
that
of
the
more
humane
of
the
two
so
little
was
this
unhappy
prince
addicted
to
seek
revenge
even
for
the
most
studied
cruelties
practised
against
him
the
conduct
of
the
community
increased
in
rigour
as
the
process
against
louis
seemed
to
draw
nearer
the
most
ordinary
points
of
personal
accommodation
were
made
subjects
of
debate
ere
they
could
be
granted
and
that
upon
the
king
being
permitted
to
shave
himself
lasted
a
long
while
every
article
was
taken
from
him
even
to
his
toothpick
and
penknife
and
the
queen
and
princesses
were
deprived
of
their
scissors
and
housewives
this
led
to
a
touching
remark
of
louis
he
saw
his
sister
while
at
work
obliged
to
bite
asunder
a
thread
which
she
had
no
means
of
cutting
and
the
words
escaped
him
ah
you
wanted
nothing
in
your
pretty
house
at
montreuil
dearest
brother
answered
the
princess
whose
character
was
that
of
sanctity
purity
of
thought
and
benevolence
can
i
complain
of
any
thing
since
heaven
has
preserved
me
to
share
and
to
comfort
in
some
degree
your
hours
of
captivity
it
was
indeed
in
the
society
of
his
family
that
the
character
of
louis
shone
to
the
greatest
advantage
and
if
when
on
the
throne
he
did
not
always
possess
the
energies
demanded
of
his
high
situation
in
the
dungeon
of
the
temple
misfortune
threw
around
him
the
glories
of
a
martyr
his
morning
hours
were
spent
in
instructing
or
amusing
the
young
dauphin
a
task
for
which
the
king
extensive
information
well
qualified
him
the
captives
enjoyed
as
they
best
might
a
short
interval
when
they
were
permitted
to
walk
in
the
gardens
of
the
temple
sure
to
be
insulted
like
charles
in
the
same
situation
by
the
sentinels
who
puffed
volumes
of
in
their
faces
as
they
passed
them
while
others
annoyed
the
ears
of
the
ladies
with
licentious
songs
or
the
most
cruel
denunciations
all
this
louis
and
his
family
endured
with
such
sainted
patience
that
several
who
obtained
access
to
his
person
were
moved
by
the
spectacle
of
royalty
reduced
to
a
situation
so
melancholy
yet
sustained
with
such
gentleness
and
fortitude
some
of
the
municipal
officers
themselves
became
melted
and
changed
their
ideas
of
the
king
when
they
beheld
him
in
so
new
and
singular
a
light
stories
of
the
insults
which
he
daily
received
and
of
the
meekness
with
which
he
sustained
them
began
to
circulate
among
the
citizens
of
the
higher
classes
and
joined
to
their
fear
of
falling
completely
under
the
authority
of
the
led
many
of
the
republicans
to
cast
back
their
thoughts
to
the
constitution
of
with
all
its
faults
and
with
its
monarchical
executive
government
the
more
wise
and
sensible
of
the
girondists
began
to
suspect
that
they
had
been
too
hasty
in
erecting
their
favourite
republic
on
ground
incapable
of
affording
a
sound
and
secure
foundation
for
such
an
edifice
buzot
gives
testimony
to
this
dated
later
no
doubt
than
the
period
we
are
treating
of
but
the
grounds
of
the
reasoning
existed
as
much
at
the
king
trial
as
after
the
expulsion
of
the
girondists
the
passage
is
remarkable
my
friends
says
this
distinguished
girondist
preserved
a
long
time
the
hopes
of
establishing
a
republic
in
france
even
when
all
seemed
to
demonstrate
that
the
enlightened
classes
whether
from
prejudice
or
from
just
reasoning
felt
indisposed
to
that
form
of
government
that
hope
did
not
forsake
my
friends
when
the
most
wicked
and
the
vilest
of
men
obtained
possession
of
the
minds
of
the
inferior
classes
and
corrupted
them
by
the
opportunities
they
offered
of
license
and
pillage
my
friends
reckoned
on
the
lightness
and
aptitude
to
change
proper
to
the
french
character
and
which
they
considered
to
be
peculiarly
suitable
to
a
republican
nation
i
have
always
considered
that
conclusion
as
entirely
false
and
have
repeatedly
in
my
heart
despaired
of
my
darling
wish
to
establish
a
republic
in
my
country
in
another
place
he
says
it
must
not
be
dissembled
that
the
majority
of
frenchmen
earnestly
desired
royalty
and
the
constitution
of
in
paris
the
wish
was
general
and
was
expressed
most
freely
though
only
in
confidential
society
and
among
private
friends
there
were
only
a
few
noble
and
elevated
minds
who
felt
themselves
worthy
to
be
republicans
and
whom
the
example
of
the
americans
had
encouraged
to
essay
the
project
of
a
similar
government
in
france
the
country
of
frivolity
and
mutability
the
rest
of
the
nation
with
the
exception
of
the
ignorant
wretches
without
either
sense
or
substance
who
vomited
abuse
against
royalty
as
at
another
time
they
would
have
done
against
a
commonwealth
and
all
without
knowing
why
the
rest
of
the
nation
were
all
attached
to
the
constitution
of
and
looked
on
the
pure
republicans
as
a
very
kind
of
madmen
in
these
lines
written
by
one
of
the
most
sincere
of
their
number
we
read
the
condemnation
of
the
girondists
who
to
adventure
the
precarious
experiment
of
a
republic
in
which
they
themselves
saw
so
many
difficulties
were
contented
to
lend
their
arms
and
countenance
to
the
destruction
of
that
very
government
which
they
knew
to
be
desired
by
all
the
enlightened
classes
of
france
except
themselves
and
which
demolition
only
made
room
for
the
dreadful

robespierre
and
marat
sidenote
louis
separated
from
his
son
but
we
also
see
from
this
and
other
passages
that
there
existed
feelings
both
in
paris
and
in
the
departments
which
if
the
convention
had
made
a
manly
appeal
to
them
might
have
saved
the
king
life
and
prevented
the
reign
of
terror
there
began
to
arise
more
obvious
signs
of
disaffection
to
the
rulers
and
of
interest
in
the
king
fate
these
were
increased
when
he
was
brought
before
the
convention
for
examination
an
occasion
upon
which
louis
was
treated
with
the
same
marked
appearance
of
premeditated
insult
which
had
been
offered
to
him
when
in
his
dungeon
he
had
as
yet
been
allowed
to
enjoy
the
society
of
his
son
though
his
intercourse
with
the
other
members
of
the
family
had
been
much
abridged
he
was
passionately
attached
to
this
unhappy
son
who
answered
his
affection
and
showed
early
token
of
talents
which
were
doomed
never
to
blossom
it
was
the
cruel
resolution
of
his
jailors
to
take
the
boy
from
his
father
on
the
very
morning
december
when
louis
was
to
undergo
an
interrogatory
before
the
convention
in
other
words
to
give
the
deepest
blow
to
his
feelings
at
the
very
moment
when
it
was
necessary
he
should
combine
his
whole
mental
powers
for
defending
his
life
against
his
subtle
and
powerful
enemies
this
cruel
measure
produced
in
some
respect
the
effect
desired
the
king
testified
more
deep
affliction
than
he
had
yet
manifested
the
child
was
playing
at
the
game
called
siam
with
his
father
and
by
no
effort
could
the
dauphin
get
beyond
the
number
that
is
a
very
unlucky
number
said
the
child
this
petty
omen
seemed
soon
accomplished
by
the
commissioners
of
the
assembly
who
without
deigning
further
explanation
than
that
louis
must
prepare
to
receive
the
mayor
of
paris
tore
the
child
from
his
father
and
left
him
to
his
sorrow
in
about
two
hours
during
which
the
trampling
of
many
horses
was
heard
and
a
formidable
body
of
troops
with
artillery
were
drawn
up
around
the
prison
the
mayor
appeared
a
man
called
chambon
weak
and
illiterate
the
willing
tool
of
the
ferocious
commune
in
which
he
presided
he
read
to
the
king
the
decree
of
the
convention
that
louis
capet
should
be
brought
to
their
bar
capet
answered
louis
is
not
my
name
it
was
that
of
one
of
my
ancestors
i
could
have
wished
sir
that
i
had
not
been
deprived
of
the
society
of
my
son
during
the
two
hours
i
have
expected
you
but
it
is
only
of
a
piece
with
the
usage
i
have
experienced
for
four
months
i
will
attend
you
to
the
convention
not
as
acknowledging
their
right
to
summon
me
but
because
i
yield
to
the
superior
power
of
my
enemies
the
crowd
pressed
much
on
the
king
during
the
passage
from
the
temple
to
the
tuileries
where
the
convention
had
now
established
their
sittings
as
men
who
had
slain
and
taken
possession
loud
cries
were
heard
demanding
the
life
of
the
tyrant
yet
louis
preserved
the
most
perfect
composure
even
when
he
found
himself
standing
as
a
criminal
before
an
assembly
of
his
native
subjects
born
most
of
them
in
a
rank
which
excluded
them
from
judicial
offices
till
he
himself
had
granted
the
privilege
louis
said
the
president
the
versatile
timorous
but
subtle
barrère
be
seated
the
king
sat
down
accordingly
and
listened
without
apparent
emotion
to
a
long
act
of
accusation
in
which
every
accident
that
had
arisen
out
of
the
revolution
was
gravely
charged
as
a
point
of
indictment
against
the
king
he
replied
by
short
laconic
answers
which
evinced
great
presence
of
mind
and
composure
and
alleged
the
decrees
of
the
national
assembly
as
authority
for
the
affair
of
nancy
and
the
firing
on
the
people
in
the
both
of
which
were
urged
against
him
as
aggressions
on
the
people
one
or
two
replies
we
can
not
omit
inserting
you
are
accused
said
the
president
of
having
authorised
money
to
be
distributed
to
poor
unknowns
in
the
suburb
of
saint
antoine
what
have
you
to
reply
that
i
know
no
greater
pleasure
answered
louis
than
in
giving
assistance
to
the
needy
you
held
a
review
of
the
swiss
at
five
in
the
morning
of
the
of
august
i
did
replied
the
king
review
the
troops
that
were
about
my
person
it
was
in
presence
of
the
constituted
authorities
the
department
and
the
mayor
of
paris
i
had
sent
in
vain
to
request
from
the
convention
a
deputation
of
its
members
and
i
came
with
my
family
to
place
myself
in
their
hands
why
did
you
double
the
strength
of
the
swiss
guards
at
that
time
demanded
the
it
was
done
with
the
knowledge
of
all
the
constituted
authorities
said
the
king
in
a
tone
of
perfect
composure
i
was
myself
a
constituted
authority
it
was
my
duty
to
defend
my
office
you
have
caused
said
the
president
the
blood
of
frenchmen
to
be
shed
what
have
you
to
reply
it
was
not
who
caused
it
answered
louis
speaking
with
more
emphasis
than
he
had
before
used
the
king
was
carried
back
to
his
prison
amid
threats
and
abuse
from
the
same
banditti
whose
ranks
he
had
before
traversed
in
replying
to
the
articles
alleged
against
him
louis
had
followed
a
different
course
from
charles
who
refused
to
plead
before
the
tribunal
at
which
he
was
arraigned
the
latter
acted
with
the
high
spirit
of
a
prince
unwilling
to
derogate
from
the
honour
of
the
crown
he
had
worn
the
former
as
a
man
of
honour
and
probity
was
desirous
of
defending
his
character
wherever
it
should
be
attacked
without
stopping
to
question
the
authority
of
the
court
which
was
met
to
try
him
a
great
tumult
followed
in
the
assembly
the
moment
the
king
had
withdrawn
the
jacobins
became
sensible
that
the
scene
which
had
just
passed
had
deeply
affected
many
of
the
neutral
party
and
was
not
unlikely
to
influence
their
final
votes
they
demanded
an
instant
decree
of
condemnation
and
that
in
the
name
of
the
oppressed
people
you
who
have
heard
the
tyrant
said
ought
in
justice
to
hear
the
people
whom
he
has
oppressed
the
convention
knew
well
what
was
meant
by
the
appearance
of
the
people
at
the
bar
and
while
they
trembled
at
this
threat
duhem
exclaimed
i
move
that
louis
be
hung
this
very
night
some
received
this
with
a
triumphant
laugh
the
majority
however
retained
too
much
sense
of
shame
to
permit
themselves
to
be
hurried
farther
that
evening
they
indulged
the
king
with
the
selection
of
counsel
to
defend
him
the
monarch
on
returning
to
his
prison
had
found
he
was
doomed
to
solitary
confinement
all
intercourse
with
his
family
was
denied
him
he
wept
but
neither
wife
sister
nor
child
was
permitted
to
share
his
tears
it
was
for
the
fate
of
his
son
that
he
showed
the
deepest
interest
yet
anxious
as
his
apprehensions
were
they
could
not
reach
the
extremities
to
which
the
child
was
reduced
the
heart
of
man
could
not
have
imagined
the
cruelty
of
his
lot
sidenote
louis
chooses
his

louis
chose
for
his
counsel
two
lawyers
of
celebrity
carefully
selecting
such
as
he
thought
would
incur
least
risk
of
danger
by
the
task
imposed
one
of
these
tronchet
was
too
sensible
to
the
honour
of
his
profession
to
hesitate
a
moment
in
accepting
the
perilous
office
but
the
other
target
refused
to
undertake
it
the
phrase
used
by
this
unworthy
jurisconsult
in
his
letter
to
the
president
of
the
convention
seemed
to
involve
the
king
condemnation
a
free
republican
he
said
ought
not
to
undertake
functions
of
which
he
feels
himself
incapable
timid
as
the
convention
was
this
excuse
was
heard
with
disapprobation
it
was
declaring
that
the
defence
of
the
king
was
untenable
by
any
friend
of
the
present
system
several
persons
offered
their
services
with
voluntary
devotion
but
the
preference
was
claimed
by
who
twice
called
by
louis
to
be
a
member
of
his
council
when
the
office
was
the
object
of
general
ambition
alleged
his
right
to
a
similar
function
when
others
might
reckon
it
dangerous
this
burst
of
honourable
awakened
a
sentiment
of
honour
in
the
convention
which
could
it
have
lasted
might
have
even
yet
prevented
a
great
national
crime
paris
began
to
show
symptoms
of
returning
interest
in
the
person
of
louis
the
calumnies
against
him
seemed
to
lose
their
influence
on
all
but
the
ignorant
multitude
and
hired
bandits
the
honest
devotion
of
malesherbes
whose
character
was
known
through
the
nation
as
a
man
of
talent
honour
and
probity
reflected
a
forcible
light
on
that
of
his
royal
client
who
had
in
the
hour
of
need
found
such
a
defender
deséze
an
excellent

afterwards
added
to

but
the
king
gained
little
more
by
this
indulgence
excepting
the
consolation
of
communicating
with
such
men
as
malesherbes
and
his
two
associates
at
a
time
when
no
other
friend
was
suffered
to
approach
him
excepting
the

entertained
some
hopes

in

exulted
when
they
saw
how
facts
contradicted

prosecutors
moderate
your
satisfaction
my
friends
said
louis
all
these
favourable
circumstances
are
well
known
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
convention
and
if
they
considered
them
as
entitled
to
weight
in
my
favour
i
should
not
be
in
this
difficulty
you
take
i
fear
a
fruitless
task
in
hand
but
let
us
perform
it
as
a
last
duty
when
the
term
of
his
second
appearance
at
the
convention
arrived
he
expressed
anxiety
at
the
thoughts
of
appearing
before
them
with
his
beard
and
hair
overgrown
owing
to
his
being
deprived
of
razors
and
scissors
were
it
not
better
your
majesty

as
you
are
at
present
said
the
faithful
cléry
that
all
men
may
see
the
usage
you
have
received
it
does
not
become
me
answered
the
king
to
seek
to
obtain
pity
with
the
same
spirit
he
commanded
his
advocates
to
avoid
all
appeals
to
the
passions
or
the
feelings
of
the
judges
and
audience
and
to
rest
his
defence
exclusively
upon
logical
deductions
from
the
evidence
produced
when
summoned
to
the
convention
louis
was
compelled
to
wait
for
a
time
in
the
outer
hall
where
he
walked
about
conversing
with
his
counsel
a
deputy
who
passed
heard
malesherbes
during
this
intercourse
use
to
his
royal
client
the
courtesies
of
your

you
so
bold

these
prohibited
expressions

answered
the
generous
malesherbes
sidenote
opening
speech
of
deseze
deséze
opened
his
case
with
great
ability
he
pleaded
with
animation
the
right
which
the
king
had
to
the
character
of
inviolability
a
right
confirmed
to
him
by
the
legislative
assembly
after
the
flight
to
varennes
and
which
implied
a
complete
indemnity
for
that
crime
even
supposing
a
journey
from
his
capital
in
a
post
carriage
with
a
few
attendants
could
be
deemed
criminal
but
he
urged
that
if
the
convention
did
not
respect
his
inviolability
if
in
a
word
they
did
not
consider
him
as
a
king
he
was
then
entitled
to
the
formal
securities
provided
for
every
citizen
by
the
laws
he
ridiculed
the
idea
that
with
a
trifling
force
of
swiss
louis
could
meditate
any
serious
injury
against
the
convention
he
prepared
said
deséze
for
his
defence
as
you
citizens
would
doubtless
do
when
you
heard
that
an
armed
multitude
were
on
their
way
to
surprise
you
in
your
sanctuary
he
closed
an
excellent
pleading
with
an
enumeration
of
the
benefits
which
louis
had
conferred
on
the
french
nation
and
reminded
them
that
their
king
had
given
them
liberty
so
soon
as
they
desired
to
be
free
louis
himself
said
a
few
words
with
much
firmness
he
was
remanded
to
the
temple
and
a
stormy
debate
commenced
sidenote
debate
at
first
the
jacobins
attempted
to
carry
all
by
a
clamorous
demand
of
the
vote
lanjuinais
replied
to
them
with
unexpected
spirit
charged
them
with
planning
and
instigating
the
assault
on
the
of
august
and
then
with
turning
on
the
king
the
blame
which
justly
lay
with
themselves
alone
dreadful
outcries
followed
this
true
and
intrepid
speech
let
the
friends
of
the
despot
die
with
him
was
the
general
exclamation
of
the
jacobins
to
the
abbaye
to
the
scaffold
with
the
perjured
deputy
who
slanders
the
glorious
of
august
be
it
so
answered
lanjuinais
better
death
than
the
crime
of
pronouncing
an
unjust
sentence
the
girondists
were
too
much
themselves
accessory
to
the
attack
on
the
tuileries
to
follow
this
bold
and
manly
line
of
defence
and
lanjuinais
stood
unsupported
in
his
opinion
saint
just
and
robespierre
eagerly
called
for
a
doom
of
death
the
former
accused
the
king
of
a
design
to
cheat
the
people
out
of
their
liberties
by
a
pretended
show
of
submission
to
their
will
and
an
affected
moderation
in
exercising
his
authority
on
the
of
august
he
had
the
effrontery
to
state
this
the
king
entering
the
hall
of
the
legislature
with
armed
followers
the
small
escort
who
had
difficulty
in
protecting
him
through
the
armed
crowd
had
violated
the
asylum
of
the
laws
besides
as
he
triumphantly
concluded
was
it
for
a
people
who
had
declared
war
against
all
tyrants
to
sorrow
for
the
fate
of
their
own
robespierre
openly
disowned
the
application
of
legal
forms
and
written
rubrics
of
law
to
such
a
case
as
was
before
the
convention
the
people
who
had
asserted
their
own
right
in
wresting
the
sceptre
from
the
hands
of
louis
had
a
right
to
punish
him
for
having
swayed
it
he
talked
of
the
case
being
already
decided
by
the
unanimous
voice
and
act
of
the
people
from
whom
all
legal
authority
emanated
and
whose
authority
was
paramount
to
that
of
the
convention
which
were
only
their
representatives
vergniaud
the
most
eloquent
of
the
girondists
found
nothing
better
to
propose
than
that
the
case
of
louis
should
be
decided
by
an
appeal
to
the
nation
he
alleged
that
the
people
who
in
solemn
federation
had
sworn
in
the
to
recognise
the
constitution
had
thereby
sworn
the
inviolability
of
the
king
this
was
truly
said
but
such
being
the
case
what
right
had
the
convention
to
protract
the
trial
by
sending
the
case
from
before
themselves
to
the
people
if
his
inviolability
had
been
formally
admitted
and
sworn
to
by
the
nation
what
had
the
convention
more
to
do
than
recognise
the
inviolability
with
which
the
nation
had
invested
the
monarch
and
dismiss
him
from
the
bar
accordingly
the
explanation
lay
here
that
the
eloquent
orator
was
hampered
and
constrained
in
his
reasoning
by
the
difficulty
of
reconciling
his
own
conduct
and
that
of
his
associates
to
the
principles
which
he
was
now
willing
to
adopt
as
those
that
were
just
and
legal
if
the
person
of
the
king
was
indeed
inviolable
what
was
to
be
thought
of
their
consistency
who
by
the
means
of
their
daring
and
devoted
associates
barbaroux
and
rebecque
had
actually
brought
up
the
force
of
marseillois
who
led
the
van
and
were
in
fact
the
efficient
and
almost
the
only
means
by
which
the
palace
of
that
inviolable
sovereign
was
stormed
his
guards
slaughtered
his
person
committed
to
prison
and
finally
his
life
brought
in
danger
it
was
the
obvious
and
personal
answer
arising
out
of
their
own
previous
manœuvres
the
ad
as
it
is
called
by
logicians
which
hung
a
padlock
on
the
lips
of
the
eloquent
vergniaud
while
using
the
argument
which
in
itself
most
just
and
true
was
irreconcilable
with
the
revolutionary
measures
to
which
he
had
been
an
express
party
do
not
evil
that
good
may
come
of
it
is
a
lesson

was
freed
from

with
the
fervour
of
a
poet
and
the
inspiration
of
a
prophet
he
declaimed
against
the
faction
of

and
announced
the
consequences
of
that
sanguinary
body
ascending
to
supreme
power
by
placing
their
first
step
on
the
body
of
louis
the
picture
which
he
drew
of
the
coming
evil
seemed
too
horrible
for
reality
and
yet
the
scenes
which
followed
even
more
than
realized
the
predictions
of
the
baffled
republican
who
saw
too
late
and
too
clearly
the
tragic
conclusion
of
the
scenes
in
which
he
had
borne
so
active
a
part
the
appeal
to
the
people
or
to
the
nation
had
been
argued
against
by
the
jacobin
speakers
as
opening
the
nearest
road
to
civil
war
indeed
it
was
one
of
the
many
objections
to
this
intermediate
and
evasive
plan
that
the
people
of
france
convened
in
their
different
bodies
were
likely
to
come
to
very
different
conclusions
on
the
king
impeachment
where
the
jacobin
clubs
were
strong
and
numerous
they
would
have
been
sure
according
to
the
maxim
of
their
union
to
use
the
compulsory
but
ready
means
of
open
violence
to
disturb
the
freedom
of
voting
on
this
important
question
and
would
thus
have
carried
by
forcible
measures
the
vote
of
death
in
departments
in
which
constitutionalists
and
royalists
had
strong
interest
it
was
probable
that
force
would
have
been
repelled
by
force
and
upon
the
whole
in
france
where
the
law
had
been
long
a
dead
letter
the
arbitrement
of
the
nation
on
the

fate
must
and
would
have
proved
a

one

of
pusillanimity

dissected

the

the

laboured
after

they
so
eagerly
pursued
they

have
the

power
for
directing
the
odium
of
every
distress
or
misfortune
against

and
making
the
representatives
of

equally
obnoxious
to
the

they
had
now
rendered
the

concluded
with
a
horrible

of

of

was

by

according

both
from

from

before

had
detached

according
to
his
own
statement
a
considerable
number
of

persons
to
second

he
might
find

rather
to
be
executioners
than
victims
among
the
citizens

of

dumouriez
states
himself
to
have
urged
with
the
argument
that
the
convention
in
assuming
the
power
of
judging
the
king
had
exceeded
the
powers
granted
to
them
by
the
nation
he
found
hearers
not
indeed
uninterested
or
unmoved
but
too
lukewarm
to
promise
efficient
assistance
the

were
in
that
state
in

hesitated
to
incur
the
fury
of
a
popular
insurrection
which
passiveness
on
their
own
part
might
postpone
or
avert
they
listened
to
the
general
with
interest
but
without
enthusiasm
implored
him
to
choose
a
less
dangerous
subject
of
conversation

spoke
of
the

of
the
influence
of
a
tempest
which
mortal
efforts

not
withstand
with

dumouriez
pressed
the
conversation
on
the
meanness
of
suffering

to
be

by
two
or
three
thousand

till
the
citizen
looked
on
the
ground
and
blushed
as
he
made
the
degrading
confession
i
see
to
what
conclusion
your
argument
tends
but
we
are
cowards
and
the

must
perish
what
exertion
of
spirit
can
you
expect
from
a
city
which
having
under

eighty
thousand
militia
suffered
themselves
notwithstanding
to
be
domineered
over
and
disarmed
by
a
comparative
handful
of
rascally
federates
from
brest
and
marseilles

hint
was

dumouriez
who
was
involved
in
much
personal
danger
desisted
from
efforts
in
which
he
could
only
compromise
his
own
safety
without
ensuring
that
of
the

he
affirms
that
during
twenty
residence
near
paris
he
witnessed
no
effort
either
public
or
private
to
avert
the
king
fate
and
that
the
only
feelings
which
prevailed
among
the
higher
classes
were
those
of
consternation
and
apathy
it
was
then
especially
to
be
regretted
that
an
emigration
certainly
premature
had
drained
the
country
of
those
fiery
and
gallant
nobles
whose
blood
would
have
been
so
readily
ventured
in
defence
of
the
king
five
hundred
men
of
high
character
and
determined
bravery
would
probably
have
been
seconded
by
the
whole
of
paris
and
might
have
bid
open
defiance
to
the
federates
or
by
some
sudden
and
bold
attempt
snatched
from
their
hands
their
intended
victim
five
hundred
but
five
hundred
of
those
who
were
winning
barren
laurels
under
condé
or
yet
more
unhappily
were
subsisting
on
the
charity
of
foreign
nations
might
at
this
moment
could
they
have
been
collected
in
paris
have
accomplished
the
purpose
for
which
they
themselves
most
desired
to
live
by
saving
the
life
of
their
unhappy
sovereign
but
although
powerful
reasons
and
yet
more
aggrieved
feelings
had
recommended
the
emigration
from
that
country
it
operated
like
the
common
experiment
of
the
leyden
phial
one
side
of
which
being
charged
with
an
uncommon
quantity
of
the
electrical
fluid
has
the
effect
of
creating
a
deficiency
of
the
same
essence
upon
the
other
in
the
interior
of
france
the
spirit
of
loyalty
was
at
the
lowest
ebb
because
those
upon
whom
it
especially
acted
as
a
principle
were
divided
from
the
rest
of
the
nation
to
whom
they
would
otherwise
have
afforded
both
encouragement
and
example
the
sacrifice
therefore
was
to
be
made
made
in
spite
of
those
who
certainly
composed
the
great
majority
of
paris
at
least
of
such
as
were
capable
of
reflection
in
spite
of
the
commander
of
the
army
dumouriez
in
spite
of
the
consciences
of
the
girondists
who
while
they
affected
an
air
of
republican
stoicism
saw
plainly
and
were
fully
sensible
of
the
great
political
error
the
great
moral
sin
they
were
about
to
commit
undoubtedly
they
expected
that
by
joining
in
or
acquiescing
in
at
least
if
not
authorising
this
unnecessary
and
wanton
cruelty
they
should
establish
their
character
with
the
populace
as
firm
and
unshaken
republicans
who
had
not
hesitated
to
sacrifice
the
king
since
his
life
was
demanded
at
the
shrine
of
freedom
they
were
not

acquiescence

have

required
to
be
defended
at
some
hazard
to
their
own
safety
the
faults
at
once
of
duplicity
and
cowardice
were
thus
fixed
on
this
party
who
detested
by
the
royalists
and
by
all
who
in
any
degree
harboured
opinions
favourable
to
monarchy
had
their
lives
and
offices
sought
after
by
the
whole
host
of
jacobins
in
full
cry

on

of
wishes
which
they

publicly
beheaded
in
the
midst
of
his
own
metropolis
in

louis
erected
to
the
memory
of
his
grandfather
it
is
possible
for
the
critical
eye
of
the
historian
to
discover
much
weakness
in
the
conduct
of
this
unhappy
monarch
for
he
had
neither
the
determination
necessary
to
fight
for
his
rights
nor
the
power
of
submitting
with
apparent
indifference
to
circumstances
where
resistance
inferred
danger
he
submitted
indeed
but
with
so
bad
a
grace
that
he
only
made
himself
suspected
of
cowardice
without
getting
credit
for
voluntary
concession
but
yet
his
behaviour
on
many
trying
occasions
effectually
vindicated
him
from
the
charge
of
timidity
and
showed
that
the
unwillingness
to
shed
blood
by
which
he
was
peculiarly
distinguished
arose
from
benevolence
not
from
pusillanimity
upon
the
scaffold
he
behaved
with
the
firmness
which
became
a
noble
spirit
and
the
patience
beseeming
one
who
was
reconciled
to
heaven
as
one
of
the
few
marks
of
sympathy
with
which
his
sufferings
were
softened
the
attendance
of
a
confessor
who
had
not
taken
the
constitutional
oath
was
permitted
to
the
dethroned
monarch
he
who
undertook
the
honourable
but
dangerous
office

a

of

circulated
upon
good
authority
bearing
this
remarkable
passage
i
recommend
to
my
son
should
he
have
the
misfortune
to
become
king
to
recollect
that
his
whole
faculties
are
due
to
the
service
of
the
public
that
he
ought
to
consult
the
happiness
of
his
people
by
governing
according
to
the
laws
forgetting
all
injuries
and
misfortunes
and
in
particular
those
which
i
may
have
sustained
but
while
i
exhort
him
to
govern
under
the
authority
of
the
laws
i
can
not
but
add
that
this
will
be
only
in
his
power
in
so
far
as
he
shall
be
endowed
with
authority
to
cause
right
to
be
respected
and
wrong
punished
and
that
without
such
authority
his
situation
in
the
government
must
be
more
hurtful
than
advantageous
to
the
state
not
to
mingle
the
fate
of
the
illustrious
victims
of
the
royal
family
with
the
general
tale
of
the
sufferers
under
the
reign
of
terror
we
must
here
mention
the
deaths
of
the
rest
of
that
illustrious
house
which
closed
for
a
time
a
monarchy
that
existing
through
three
dynasties
had
given
kings
to
france
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
queen
was
to
be
long
permitted
to
survive
her
husband
she
had
been
even
more
than
he
the
object
of
revolutionary
detestation
nay
many
were
disposed
to
throw
on
marie
antoinette
almost
exclusively
the
blame
of
those
measures
which
they
considered
as
she
came
to
france
a
gay
young
and
beautiful
princess
she
found
in
her
husband
a
faithful
affectionate
almost
an
uxorious
husband
in
the
early
years
of
her
reign
she
was
guilty
of
two
faults
in
the
first
place
she
dispensed
too
much
with
and
wished
too
often
to
enjoy
a
retirement
and
freedom
inconsistent
with
her
high
rank
and
the
customs
of
the
court
this
was
a
great
though
natural
mistake
the
etiquette
of
a
court
places
round
the
great
personages
whom
it
regards
a
close
and
troublesome
watch
but
that
very
guard
acts
as
a
barrier
against
calumny
and
when
these
formal
witnesses
are
withdrawn
evil
tongues
are
never
wanting
to
supply
with
infamous
reports
a
blank
which
no
testimony
can
be
brought
to
fill
up
with
the
truth
no
individual
suffered
more
than
marie
antoinette
from
this
species
of
slander
which
imputed
the
most
scandalous
occupations
to
hours
that
were
only
meant
to
be
stolen
from
form
and
from
state
and
devoted
to
the
ease
which
crowned
heads
ought
never
to
dream
of
enjoying
another
natural
yet
equally
false
step
was
her
interfering
more
frequently
with
politics
than
became
her
sex
exhibiting
thus
her
power
over
the
king
and
at
the
same
time
lowering
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
subjects
who
whatever
be
the
auspices
under
which
their
own
domestic
affairs
are
conducted
are
always
scandalized
if
they
see
or
think
they
see
any
thing
like
female
influence
directing
the
councils
of
their
sovereigns
we
are
uncertain
what
degree
of
credit
is
to
be
given
to
the
memoirs
of
bezenval
but
we
believe
they
approach
near
the
truth
in
representing
the
queen
as
desirous
of
having
a
party
of
her
own
and
carrying
points
in
opposition
to
the
ministers
and
we
know
that
a
general
belief
of
this
sort
was
the
first
foundation
of
the
fatal
report
that
an
austrian
cabal
existed
in
the
court
of
france
under
the
direction
of
the
queen
which
was
supposed
to
sacrifice
the
interests
of
france
to
favour
those
of
the
emperor
of
germany
the
terms
of
her
accusation
were
too
basely
depraved
to
be
even
hinted
at
here
she
scorned
to
reply
to
it
but
appealed
to
all
who
had
been
mothers
against
the
very
possibility
of
the
horrors
which
were
stated
against
her
the
widow
of
a
king
the
sister
of
an
emperor
was
condemned
to
death
dragged
in
an
open
tumbril
to
the
place
of
execution
and
beheaded
on
the
october
she
suffered
death
in
her
year
the
princess
elizabeth
sister
of
louis
of
whom
it
might
be
said
in
the
words
of
lord
clarendon
that
she
resembled
a
chapel
in
a
palace
into
which
nothing
but
piety
and
morality
enter
while
all
around
is
filled
with
sin
idleness
and
folly
did
not
by
the
most
harmless
demeanour
and
inoffensive
character
escape
the
miserable
fate
in
which
the
jacobins
had
determined
to
involve
the
whole
family
of
louis
xvi
part
of
the
accusation
redounded
to
the
honour
of
her
character
she
was
accused
of
having
admitted
to
the
apartments
of
the
tuileries
some
of
the
national
guards
of
the
section
of
filles
de
saint
thomas
and
causing
the
wounds
to
be
looked
to
which
they
had
received
in
a
skirmish
with
the
marseillois
immediately
before
the
of
august
the
princess
admitted
her
having
done
so
and
it
was
exactly
in
consistence
with
her
whole
conduct
another
charge
stated
the
ridiculous
accusation
that
she
had
distributed
bullets
chewed
by
herself
and
her
attendants
to
render
them
more
fatal
to
the
defenders
of
the
castle
of
the
tuileries
a
ridiculous
fable
of
which
there
was
no
proof
whatever
she
was
beheaded
in
may
and
met
her
death
as
became
the
manner
in
which
her
life
had
been
spent
we
are
weary
of
recounting
these
atrocities
as
others
must
be
of
reading
them
yet
it
is
not
useless
that
men
should
see
how
far
human
nature
can
be
carried
in

every
feeling

most
sacred
to
every
pleading
whether
of
justice
or
of

age
at
which
no

could
have
been
given
and
from
which
no

she
was

and

at

that
they
were
sent
for
to

it
was
only
the
officers
looking
for
a

mass
they
did
not
however
abandon
the
hope
of
seeing
him
till
the
shouts
of
joy
of
the
unprincipled
populace
came
to
tell
them
that
all
was
over

the
procession
from
the
temple
to

place
of

lasted
nearly
two
hours
as
soon
as
the
carriage
stopped
the
king
whispered

i

not
my
silence
answered
that
we
were
one
of
the
guards
came
to
open
the
door
and
the
would
have
jumped
out
but
the
king
stopped
them
and
leaning
his
arm
on
my
knee
said
he
with
the
tone
of
majesty
recommend
to
you
this
good
man
take

after

death
no

be
offered

you
to
prevent
it
as
soon
as
the
king
had
left
the
carriage
three
guards
surrounded
him
and
would
have
taken
off
his
clothes
but
he
repulsed
them
with
dignity
he
undressed
himself
untied
his
neckcloth
opened
his
shirt
and
arranged
it
himself
the
path
leading
to
the
scaffold
was
extremely
rough
and
from
the
slowness
with
which
the
king
proceeded
i
feared
for
a
moment
that
his
courage
might
be
failing
but
what
was
my
astonishment
when
arrived
at
the
last
step
i
felt
him
suddenly
let
go
my
arm
and
saw
him
cross
with
a
firm
foot
the
breadth
of
the
whole
scaffold
he
silenced
by
his
look
alone
fifteen
or
twenty
drums
and
i
heard
him
in
a
loud
voice
pronounce
distinctly
these
memorable
words
die
innocent
of
all
the
crimes
laid
to
my
charge
i
pardon
those
who
have
occasioned

on

waved
his

dumouriez
naturally
proud
of
his
conquest
felt
for
those
who
had
surrendered
to
his
arms
upon
assurance
of
being
well
treated
and
was
sensible
that
his
own
honour
and
influence
were
aimed
at
and
that
it
was
the
object
of
the
convention
to
make
use
of
his
abilities
only
as
their
implements
and
to
keep
his
army
in

state

sidenote
projects
of

the
general
on
the
contrary
had
the
ambition
as
well
as
the
talents
of
a
conqueror
he
considered
his
army
as
the
means
of
attaining
the
victories
which
without
him
it
could
not
have
achieved
and
he
desired
to
retain
it
under
his
own
immediate
command
as
a
combatant
wishes
to
keep
hold
of
the
sword
which
he
has
wielded
with
success
he
accounted
himself
strongly
possessed
of
the
hearts
of
his
soldiers
and
therefore
thought
himself
qualified
to
play
the
part
of
military
umpire
in
the
divisions
of
the
state
which
la
fayette
had
attempted
in
vain
and
it
was
with
this
view
doubtless
that
he
undertook
that
expedition
to
paris
in
which
he
vainly
attempted
a
mediation
in
behalf
of
the
king
after
leaving
paris
dumouriez
seems
to
have
abandoned
louis
personally
to
his
fate
yet
still
retaining
hopes
to
curb
the
headlong
course
of
the
revolution
two
plans
presented
themselves
to
his
fertile
invention
nor
can
it
be
known
with
certainty
to
which
of
them
he
most
inclined
he
may
have
entertained
the
idea
of
prevailing
upon
the
army
to
decide
for
the
youthful
dauphin
to
be
their
constitutional
king
or
as
many
have
thought
it
may
better
have
suited
his
personal
views
to
have
recommended
to
the
throne
a
gallant
young
prince
of
the
blood
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
his
army
the
eldest
son
of
the
miserable
duke
of
orleans
such
a
change
of
dynasty
might
be
supposed
to
limit
the
wishes
of
the
proposed
sovereign
to
that
share
of
power
entrusted
to
him
by
the
revolution
since
he
would
have
had
no
title
to
the
crown
save
what
arose
from
the
constitution
but
to
qualify
himself
in
either
case
to
act
as
the
supreme
head
of
the
army
independent
of
the
national
convention
it
was
necessary
that
dumouriez
should
pursue
his
conquests
act
upon
the
plan
laid
down
by
the
ministers
at
paris
and
in
addition
to
his
title
of
victor
in
belgium
add
that
of
conqueror
of
holland
he
commenced
accordingly
an
invasion
of
the
latter
country
with
some
prospect
of
success
but
though
he
took
gertruydenberg
and
blockaded
he
was
repulsed
from
williamstadt
and
at
the
same
time
he
received
information
that
an
army
of
austrians
under
the
prince
of
a
general
of
eminence
though
belonging
to
the
old
military
school
of
germany
was
advancing
into
flanders
dumouriez
retreated
from
holland
to
make
a
stand
against
these
new
enemies
and
was
again
unfortunate
the
french
were
defeated
at
and
their
new
levies
almost
entirely
dispersed
chagrined
with
this
disaster
dumouriez
gave
an
imprudent
loose
to
the
warmth
of
his
temper
following
the
false
step
of
la
fayette
in
menacing
before
he
was
prepared
to
strike
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
convention
threatening
the
jacobin
party
with
the
indignation
of
his
army
this
was
on
the
march
and
six
days
afterwards
he
was
again
defeated
in
the
battle
of
neerwinden
it
must
have
been
extremely
doubtful
whether
in
the
very
pitch
of
victory
dumouriez
possessed
enough
of
individual
influence
over
his
army
to
have
inclined
them
to
declare
against
the
national
convention
the
forces
which
he
commanded
were
not
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
regular
army
long
embodied
and
engaged
perhaps
for
years
in
difficult
enterprises
and
in
foreign
countries
where
such
a
force
exists
as
a
community
only
by
their
military
relations
to
each
other
where
the
common
soldiers
knew
no
other
home
than
their
tents
and
no
other
direction
than
the
voice
of
their
officers
and
the
officers
no
other
laws
than
the
pleasure
of
the
general
such
armies
holding
themselves
independent
of
the
civil
authorities
of
their
country
came
at
length
through
the
habit
of
long
wars
and
distant
conquests
to
exist
in
the
french
empire
and
upon
such
rested
the
of
the
imperial
throne
but
as
yet
the
troops
of
the
republic
consisted
either
of
the
regiments
revolutionized
when
the
great
change
had
offered
commissions
to
privates
and
batons
to
subalterns
or
of
new
levies
who
had
their
very
existence
through
the
revolution
and
whose
common
nickname
of
carmagnoles
expressed
their
republican
origin
and
opinions
such
troops
might
obey
the
voice
of
the
general
on
the
actual
field
of
battle
but
were
not
very
amenable
even
to
the
ordinary
course
of
discipline
elsewhere
and
were
not
likely
to
exchange
their
rooted
political
principles
with
all
the
ideas
of
license
connected
with
them
at
dumouriez
word
of
command
as
they
would
have
changed
their
front
or
have
adopted
any
routine
military
movement
still
less
were
they
likely
implicitly
to
obey
this
commander
when
the
of
his
fortune
seemed
in
the
act
of
abandoning
him
and
least
of
all
when
they
found
him
disposed
to
make
a
compromise
with
the
very
foe
who
had
defeated
him
and
perceived
that
he
negotiated
by
abandoning
his
conquests
to
the
austrians
to
purchase
the
opportunity
or
permission
of
executing
the
which
he
proposed
nevertheless
dumouriez
either
pushed
on
by
an
active
and
sanguine
temper
or
being
too
far
advanced
to
retreat
endeavoured
by
intrigues
in
his
own
army
and
an
understanding
with
the
prince
of

render
himself
strong
enough
to
overset
the
reigning
party
in

restore
with
some
modifications

purpose

alliance
with
the
invaders
whom
he
was
commissioned
to
oppose
sidenote
dumouriez
defeated
all
this
rash
conduct
disunited
the
tie
between
dumouriez
and
his
army
the
resistance
to
his
authority
became
general
and
finally
it
was
with
great
difficulty
and
danger
that
he
made
his
escape
to
the
austrian
camp
with
his
young
friend
the
duke
de
chartres
all
that
this
able
and
ambitious
man
saved
in
his
retreat
was
merely
his
life
of
which
he
spent
some
years
afterwards
in
germany
concluding
it
in
england
a
few
years
ago
without
again
making
any
figure
in
the
political
horizon
thus
the
attempt
of
dumouriez
to
use
military
force
to
stem
the
progress
of
the
revolution
failed
like
that
of
la
fayette
some
months
before
to
use
a
medical
simile
the
imposthume
was
not
yet
far
enough
advanced
and
sufficiently
come
to
a
head
to
be
benefited
by
the
use
of
the
lancet
meanwhile
the
convention
though
triumphant
over
the
schemes
of
the
revolted
general
was
divided
by
the
two
parties
to
whom
its
walls
served
for
an
arena
in
which
to
aim
against
each
other
the
most
deadly
blows
it
was
now
manifest
that
the
strife
must
end
tragically
for
one
of
the
parties
and
all
circumstances
pointed
out
the
girondists
as
the
victims
they
had
indeed
still
the
command
of
majorities
in
the
convention
especially
when
the
votes
were
taken
by
scrutiny
or
ballot
on
which
occasions
the
feebler
deputies
of
the
plain
could
give
their
voice
according
to
their
consciences
without
its
being
known
that
they
had
done
so
but
in
open
debate
and
when
the
members
voted
amongst
the
intimidating
cries
and
threats
of
tribunes
filled
by
an
infuriated
audience
the
spirit
of
truth
and
justice
seemed
too
nearly
allied
to
that
of
martyrdom
to
be
prevalent
generally
amongst
men
who
made
their
own
safety
the
rule
of
their
own
political
conduct
the
party
however
continued
for
several
months
to
exercise
the
duties
of
administration
and
to
make
such
a
struggle
in
the
convention
as
could
be
achieved
by
oratory
and
reasoning
against
underhand
intrigue
supported
by
violent
declamation
and
which
was
upon
the
least
signal
sure
of
the
aid
of
actual
brutal
violence
the
girondists
we
have
seen
had
aimed
decrees
of
the
assembly
at
the
triumvirate
and
a
plot
was
now
laid
among
the
jacobins
to
repay
that
intended
distinction
by
the
actual
strokes
of
the
axe
or
failing
that
of
the
dagger
when
the
news
of
dumouriez
defection
arrived
the
jacobins
always
alert
in
prepossessing
the
public
mind
held
out
the
girondists
as
the
associates
of
the
revolted
general
it
was
on
them
that
they
directed
the
public
animosity
great
and
furious
in
proportion
to
the
nature
of
the
crisis
that
majority
of
the
convention
which
the
traitor
dumouriez
affirmed
was
sound
and
with
which
he
acted
in
concert
intimated
according
to
the
jacobins
the
girondists
the
allies
of
his
treasons
they
called
out
in
the
convention
on
the
of
march
for
a
tribunal
of
judgment
fit
to
decide
on
such
crimes
without
the
delays
arising
from
ordinary
forms
of
pleading
and
evidence
and
without
even
the
intervention
of
a
jury
the
girondists
opposed
this
measure
and
the
debate
was
violent
in
the
course
of
the
subsequent
days
an
insurrection
of
the
people
was
prepared
by
the
jacobins
as
upon
the
june
and
of
august
it
ought
to
have
broken
out
upon
the
of
march
which
was
the
day
destined
to
put
an
end
to
the
ministerial
party
by
a
general
massacre
but
the
girondists
received
early
intelligence
of
what
was
intended
and
absented
themselves
from
the
convention
on
the
day
of
peril
a
body
of
federates
from
brest
about
four
hundred
strong
were
also
detached
in
their
favour
by
kevelegan
one
of
the
deputies
from
the
ancient
province
of
bretagne
and
who
was
a
zealous
girondist
the
precaution
however
slight
was
sufficient
for
the
time
the
men
who
were
prepared
to
murder
were
unwilling
to
fight
however
strong
the
odds
on
their
side
and
the
mustering
of
the
jacobin
bravoes
proved
on
this
occasion
an
empty
menace
duly
improved
a
discovered
conspiracy
is
generally
of
advantage
to
the
party
against
which
it
was
framed
but
vergniaud
when
in
a
subsequent
sitting
he
denounced
to
the
convention
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
to
put
to
death
a
number
of
the
deputies
was
contented
to
impute
it
to
the
influence
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
nobles
the
priests
and
the
emissaries
of
pitt
and
cobourg
thus
suffering
the
jacobins
to
escape
every
imputation
of
that
blame
which
all
the
world
knew
attached
to
them
and
to
them
only
he
was
loudly
applauded
marat
who
rose
after
him
was
applauded
as
loudly
and
the
revolutionary
tribunal
was
established
louvet
who
exclaims
against
vergniaud
for
his
pusillanimity
says
that
the
orator
alleged
in
his
excuse
the
danger
of
incensing
violent
men
already
capable
of
all
excesses
they
had
come
to
the
boar
chase
they
had
roused
him
and
provoked
his
anger
and
now
they
felt
too
late
that
they
lacked
weapons
with
which
to
attack
the
irritated
monster
the
plot
of
the
march
had
been
compared
to
that
of
the
catholics
on
the
november
in
england
it
had
been
described
in
the
as
a
horrible
conspiracy
by
which
a
company
of
ruffians
assuming
the
title
of
la
in
remembrance
of
the
massacre
of
avignon
surrounded
the
hall
for
two
days
with
the
purpose
of
dissolving
the
national
convention
by
force
and
putting
to
death
a
great
proportion
of
the
deputies
yet
the
convention
passed
over
without
effective
prosecution
of
any
kind
a
crime
of
so
enormous
a
dye
and
in
doing
so
showed
themselves
more
afraid
of
immediate
personal
consequences
than
desirous
of
seizing
an
opportunity
to
rid
france
of
the
horrible
faction
by
whom
they
were
scourged
and
menaced
sidenote
decree
against
marat
in
the
midst
of
next
month
the
jacobins
became
the
assailants
proud
it
may
be
supposed
of
the
impunity
under
which
they
had
been
sheltered
robespierre
impeached
by
name
the
leaders
of
the
girondists
as
accomplices
of
dumouriez
but
it
was
not
in
the
convention
where
robespierre
force
lay
guadet
with
great
eloquence
repelled
the
charge
and
in
his
turn
denounced
robespierre
and
the
jacobins
he
proclaimed
to
the
convention
that
they
sat
and
debated
under
raised
sabres
and
poniards
which
a
moment
signal
could
let
loose
on
them
and
he
read
from
the
journal
conducted
by
marat
an
appeal
calling
on
the
people
to
rise
in
insurrection
fear
and
shame
gave
the
convention
momentary
courage
they
passed
a
decree
of
accusation
against
marat
who
was
obliged
to
conceal
himself
for
a
few
days
buzot
it
may
be
remarked
censures
this
decree
against
marat
as
impolitic
seeing
it
was
the
first
innovation
affecting
the
inviolability
of
the
persons
of
the
deputies
in
point
of
principle
he
is
certainly
right
but
as
to
any
practical
effects
resulting
from
this
breach
of
privilege
by
reprisals
on
the
other
side
we
are
quite
sceptical
whatever
violence
was
done
to
the
girondists
at
the
end
of
the
conflict
was
sure
to
have
befallen
them
whether
marat
had
been
arrested
or
not
precedents
were
as
useless
to
such
men
as
a
vizard
to
one
of
their
ruffians
both
could
do
their
business
barefaced
the
convention
went
farther
than
the
decree
of
accusation
against
marat
and
for
the
first
time
showed
their
intention
to
make
a
stand
against
the
jacobins
on
the
motion
of
barrère
they
nominated
a
commission
of
twelve
members
some
girondists
some
neutrals
to
watch
over
and
repress
the
movements
of
such
citizens
as
should
seem
disposed
to
favour
anarchy
sidenote
insurrection
against
girondists
the
convention
were
not
long
of
learning
the
character
of
the
opposition
which
they
had
now
defied
pache
mayor
of
paris
and
one
of
the
worst
men
of
the
revolution
appeared
at
the
bar
of
the
convention
with
two
thousand
petitioners
as
they
were
called
they
demanded
in
the
name
of
the
sections
the
arrest
of
of
the
most
distinguished
of
the
girondist
leaders
the
convention
got
rid
of
the
petition
by
passing
to
the
order
of
the
day
but
the
courage
of
the
anarchists
was
greatly
increased
and
they
saw
that
they
had
only
to
bear
down
with
repeated
attacks
an
enemy
who
had
no
fortification
save
the
frail
defences
of
the
law
which
it
was
the
pride
of
the
jacobins
to
surmount
and
to
defy
their
demand
of
proscription
against
these
unfortunate
deputies
was
a
measure
from
which
they
never
departed
and
their
audacity
in
urging
it
placed
that
party
on
the
defensive
who
ought
in
all
reason
to
have
been
active
in
the
attack
the
girondists
however
felt
the
extremity
to
which
they
were
reduced
and
sensible
of
the
great
advantage
to
be
attained
by
being
the
assailants
in
such
a
struggle
they
endeavoured
to
regain
the
offensive
the
revolutionary
tribunal
to
which
marat
had
been
sent
by
the
decree
of
accusation
knew
their
business
too
well
to
convict
any
one
much
less
such
a
distinguished
patriot
who
was
only
accused
of
stimulating
the
people
to
exercise
the
sacred
right
of
insurrection
he
was
honourably
acquitted
after
scarcely
the
semblance
of
a
trial
and
brought
back
to
his
place
in
the
convention
crowned
with
a
civic
coronet
and
accompanied
by
a
band
of
such
determined
ruffians
as
were
worthy
to
form
his
they
insisted
on
filing
through
the
hall
while
a
huge
pioneer
their
spokesman
assured
the
convention
that
the
people
loved
marat
and
that
the
cause
of
marat
and
the
people
would
always
be
the
same
meanwhile
the
committee
of
twelve
proceeded
against
the
terrorists
with
some
vigour
one
of
the
most
furious
provokers
of
insurrection
and
murder
was
hébert
a
devoted
jacobin
substitute
of
the
procureur
syndic
of
the
community
speaking
to
this
body
who
now
exercised
the
whole
powers
of
magistracy
in
paris
this
man
had
not
blushed
to
demand
the
heads
of
three
hundred
deputies
he
was
arrested
and
committed
to
prison
this
decisive
action
ought
in
policy
to
have
been
followed
by
other
steps
equally
firm
the
girondists
by
displaying
confidence
might
surely
have
united
to
themselves
a
large
number
of
the
neutral
party
and
might
have
established
an
interest
in
the
sections
of
paris
consisting
of
men
who
though
timid
without
leaders
held
in
deep
horror
the
revolutionary
faction
and
trembled
for
their
families
and
their
property
if
put
under
the
guardianship
as
it
had
been
delicately
expressed
of
the
rabble
of
the
fauxbourgs
the
very
show
of
four
hundred
bretons
had
disconcerted
the
whole
conspiracy
of
the
of
march
and
therefore
with
a
moderate
support
of
determined
men
statesmen
of
a
more
resolute
and
practised
character
than
these
theoretical
philosophers
might
have
bid
defiance
to
the
mere
mob
of
paris
aided
by
a
few
hundreds
of
hired
ruffians
at
the
worst
they
would
have
perished
in
attempting
to
save
their
country
from
the
most
vile
and
horrible
tyranny
the
girondists
however
sat
in
the
convention
like
when
the
hawk
is
abroad
afraid
either
to
remain
where
they
were
or
to
attempt
a
flight
yet
as
they
could
make
no
armed
interest
in
paris
there
was
much
to
induce
them
to
quit
the
metropolis
and
seek
a
place
of
free
deliberation
elsewhere
france
indeed
was
in
such
a
state
that
had
these
unfortunate
experimentalists
possessed
any
influence
in
almost
any
department
they
could
hardly
have
failed
to
bring
friends
around
them
if
they
had
effected
a
retreat
to
it
versailles
seems
to
have
been
thought
of
as
the
scene
of
their
adjournment
by
those
who
nourished
such
an
idea
and
it
was
believed
that
the
inhabitants
of
that
town
repentant
of
the
part
they
had
played
in
driving
from
them
the
royal
family
and
the
legislative
body
would
have
stood
in
their
defence
but
neither
from
the
public
journals
and
histories
of
the
time
nor
from
the
private
memoirs
of
buzot
barbaroux
or
louvet
does
it
appear
that
these
infatuated
philosophers
thought
either
of
flight
or
defence
they
appear
to
have
resembled
the
wretched
animal
whose
chance
of
escape
from
its
enemies
rests
only
in
the
pitiful
cries
which
it
utters
when
seized
their
whole
system
was
a
castle
in
the
air
and
when
it
vanished
they
could
only
sit
down
and
lament
over
it
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
allowed
to
the
girondists
that
the
inefficiency
and
imbecility
of
their
conduct
was
not
to
be
attributed
to
personal
cowardice
enthusiasts
in
their
political
opinions
they
saw
their
ruin
approaching
waited
for
it
and
dared
it
but
like
that
of
the
monarch
they
had
been
so
eager
to
dethrone
and
by
dethroning
whom
they
had
made
way
for
their
own
ruin
their
resolution
was
of
a
passive
not
an
active
character
patient
and
steady
to
endure
wrong
but
inefficient
where
the
object
was
to
do
right
towards
themselves
and
france
for
many
nights
these
unhappy
and
devoted
deputies
still
possessed
of
the
ministerial
power
were
so
far
from
being
able
to
ensure
their
own
safety
or
that
of
the
country
under
their
nominal
government
that
they
had
shifted
about
from
one
place
of
rendezvous
to
another
not
daring
to
occupy
their
own
lodgings
and
usually
remaining
three
or
four
together
armed
for
defence
of
their
lives
in
such
places
of
secrecy
and
safety
as
they
could
devise
it
was
on
the
night
preceding
the
of
may
that
louvet
with
five
of
the
most
distinguished
of
the
girondist
party
had
absconded
into
such
a
retreat
more
like
robbers
afraid
of
the
police
than
legislators
when
the
tocsin
was
rung
at
dead
of
night
rabaud
de
saint
etienne
a
protestant
clergyman
and
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
the
party
for
humanity
and
resolution
received
it
as
a
and
continued
to
repeat
suprema
sidenote
insurrection
of
the
of
may
the
alarm
was
designed
to
raise
the
suburbs
but
in
this
task
the
jacobins
do
not
seem
to
have
had
the
usual
facilities
at
least
they
began
by
putting
their
bloodhounds
on
a
scent
upon
which
they
thought
them
likely
to
run
more
readily
than
the
mere
murder
or
arrest
of
twenty
or
thirty
deputies
of
the
convention
they
devised
one
which
suited
admirably
both
to
alarm
the
wealthier
citizens
and
teach
them
to
be
contented
with
looking
to
their
own
safety
and
to
animate
the
rabble
with
the
hope
of
plunder
the
rumour
was
spread
that
the
section
of
la
comprehending
the
palais
royal
and
the
most
wealthy
shops
in
paris
had
become
had
displayed
the
white
cockade
and
were
declaring
for
the
bourbons
of
this
not
a
word
was
true
the
citizens
of
the
palais
royal
were
disposed
perhaps
to
royalty
certainly
for
a
quiet
and
established
government
but
loved
their
own
shops
much
better
than
the
house
of
bourbon
and
had
no
intention
of
placing
them
in
jeopardy
either
for
king
or
kaisar
they
heard
with
alarm
the
accusation
against
them
mustered
in
defence
of
their
property

gates
of

royal
which
admits
of
being
strongly
defended
turned
cannon
with
lighted
matches
upon
the
mob
as
they
approached
their
precincts
and
showed
in
a
way
sufficient
to
intimidate
the
rabble
of
saint
antoine
that
though
the
wealthy
burgesses
of
paris
might
abandon
to
the
mob
the
care
of
killing
kings
and
changing
ministers
they
had
no
intention
whatever
to
yield
up
to
them
the
charge
of
their
counters
and
tills
five
sections
were
under
arms
and
ready
to
act
not
one
of
the
girondist
party
seems
to
have
even
attempted
to
point
out
to
them
that
by
an
exertion
to
preserve
the
independence
of
the
convention
they
might
rid
themselves
for
ever
of
the
domination
under
which
all
who
had
property
feeling
or
education
were
rendered
slaves
by
these
recurring
insurrections
this
is
the
more
extraordinary
as
raffé
the
commandant
of
the
section
of
la
had
actually
marched
to
the
assistance
of
the
convention
on
the
of
march
then
as
now
besieged
by
an
armed
force
left
to
themselves
the
sections
who
were
in
arms
to
protect
order
thought
it
enough
to
provide
against
the
main
danger
of
the
moment
the
sight
of
their
array
and
of
their
determined
appearance
far
more
than
their
cockades
and
cries
of
vive
la
republique
were
sufficient
to
make
the
insurgents
recognise
those
as
good
citizens
who
could
not
be
convicted
of
without
a
bloody
combat
they
were
however
at
length
made
to
comprehend
by
their
leaders
that
the
business
to
be
done
lay
in
the
hall
of
the
convention
and
that
the
exertions
of
each
active
citizen
were
to
entitle
him
to
forty
for
the
day
work
in
the
whole
affair
there
was
so
much
of
cold
trick
and
so
little
popular
enthusiasm
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
the
plotters
might
not
have
been
countermined
and
blown
to
the
moon
with
their
own
petard
had
there
been
active
spirit
or
practical
courage
on
the
side
of
those
who
were
the
assailed
party
but
we
see
no
symptoms
of
either
the
convention
were
surrounded
by
the
rabble
and
menaced
in
the
grossest
terms
under
the
general
terror
inspired
by
their
situation
they
finally
recalled
the
commission
of
twelve
and
set
hébert
at
liberty
concessions
which
though
short
of
those
which
the
jacobins
had
determined
to
insist
upon
were
such
as
showed
that
the
power
of
the
girondists
was
entirely
destroyed
and
that
the
convention
itself
might
be
overawed
at
the
pleasure
of
whoever
should
command
the
mob
of
paris
the
jacobins
were
now
determined
to
follow
up
their
blow
by
destroying
the
enemy
whom
they
had
disarmed
the
of
june
was
fixed
for
this
purpose
louvet
and
some
others
of
the
girondist
party
did
not
choose
to
await
the
issue
but
fled
from
paris
to
secure
the
rest
of
the
devoted
party
the
barriers
of
the
city
were
shut
on
this
decisive
occasion
the
jacobins
had
not
trusted
entirely
to
the
efficiency
of
their
suburb
forces
they
had
also
under
their
orders
about
two
thousand
federates
who
were
encamped
in
the
and
had
been
long
tutored
in
the
part
they
had
to
act
they
harnessed
guns
and
howitzers
prepared
and
shells
and
actually
heated
shot
as
if
their
purpose
had
been
to
attack
some
strong
fortress
instead
of
a
hall
filled
with
the
unarmed
representatives
of
the
people
henriot
of
the
armed
force
of
paris
a
fierce
ignorant
man
entirely
devoted
to
the
jacobin
interest
took
care
in
posting
the
armed
force
which
arrived
from
all
hands
around
the
convention
to
station
those
nearest
to
the
legislative
body
whose
dispositions
with
regard
to
them
were
most
notoriously
violent
they
were
thus
entirely
surrounded
as
if
in
a
net
and
the
jacobins
had
little
more
to
do
than
to
select
their
victims
the
universal
cry
of
the
armed
men
who
surrounded
the
convention
was
for
a
decree
of
death
or
outlawry
against
members
of
the
girondist
party
who
had
been
pointed
out
by
the
petition
of
pache
and
by
subsequent
petitions
of
the
most
inflammatory
nature
as
accomplices
of
dumouriez
enemies
of
the
good
city
of
paris
and
traitors
who
meditated
a
federative
instead
of
an
indivisible
republic
this
list
of
proscription
included
the
ministers
the
convention
were
in
a
dreadful
situation
it
was
manifest
that
the
arm
of
strong
force
was
upon
them
those
who
were
supposed
to
belong
to
the
girondist
party
were
struck
and
abused
as
they
entered
the
hall
hooted
and
threatened
as
they
arose
to
deliver
their
opinion
the
members
were
no
longer
free
to
speak
or
vote
there
could
be
no
deliberation
within
the
assembly
while
such
a
scene
of
tumult
and
fury
continued
and
increased
without
barrère
leader
as
we
have
said
of
the
plain
or
neutral
party
who
thought
with
the
girondists
in
conscience
and
acted
with
the
jacobins
in
fear
proposed
one
of
those
seemingly
moderate
measures
which
involve
as
sure
destruction
to
those
who
adopt
them
as
if
their
character
were
more
decisively
hostile
with
compliments
to
their
good
intentions
with
lamentations
for
the
emergency
he
entreated
the
proscribed
girondists
to
sacrifice
themselves
as
the
unhappy
subjects
of
disunion
in
the
republic
and
to
resign
their
character
of
deputies
the
convention
he
said
would
then
declare
them
under
the
protection
of
the
law
as
if
they
were
not
invested
with
that
protection
while
they
were
convicted
of
no
crime
and
clothed
at
the
same
time
with
the
inviolability
of
which
he
advised
them
to
divest
themselves
it
was
as
if
a
man
were
requested
to
lay
aside
his
armour
on
the
promise
that
the
ordinary
garments
which
he
wore
under
it
should
be
rendered
impenetrable
but
a
frenchman
is
easily
induced
to
do
that
to
which
he
is
provoked
as
involving
a
point
of
honour
this
treacherous
advice
was
adopted
by
isnard
dussaux
and
others
of
the
proscribed
deputies
who
were
thus
persuaded
to
abandon
what
defences
remained
to
them
in
hopes
to
soften
the
ferocity
of
an
enemy
too
inveterate
to
entertain
feelings
of
generosity
lanjuinais
maintained
a
more
honourable
struggle
expect
not
from
me
he
said
to
the
convention
to
hear
either
of
submission
or
resignation
of
my
official
character
am
i
free
to
offer
such
a
resignation
or
are
you
free
to
receive
it
as
he
would
have
turned
his
eloquence
against
robespierre
and
the
jacobins
an
attempt
was
made
by
legendre
and
chabot
to
drag
him
from
the
tribune
while
he
resisted
he
received
several
blows
cruel
men
he
exclaimed
the
heathens
adorned
and
caressed
the
victims
whom
they
led
to
the
slaughter
you
load
them
with
blows
and
insult
shame
procured
him
a
moment
hearing
during
which
he
harangued
the
assembly
with
much
effect
on
the
baseness
treachery
cruelty
and
impolicy
of
thus
surrendering
their
brethren
to
the
call
of
a
bloodthirsty
multitude
from
without
stimulated
by
a
vengeful
minority
of
their
own
members
the
convention
made
an
effort
to
free
themselves
from
the
toils
in
which
they
were
entangled
they
resolved
to
go
out
in
a
body
and
ascertain
what
respect
would
be
paid
to
their
persons
by
the
armed
force
assembled
around
them
sidenote
fall
of
the
girondists
they
sallied
forth
accordingly
in
procession
into
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
the
jacobins
alone
remaining
in
the
hall
but
their
progress
was
presently
arrested
by
henriot
at
the
head
of
a
strong
military
staff
and
a
large
body
of
troops
every
passage
leading
from
the
gardens
was
secured
by
soldiers
the
president
read
the
decree
of
the
assembly
and
commanded
henriot
obedience
the
commandant
of
paris
only
replied
by
reining
back
his
horse
and
commanding
the
troops
to
stand
to
their
arms
return
to
your
posts
he
said
to
the
terrified
legislators
the
people
demand
the
traitors
who
are
in
the
bosom
of
your
assembly
and
will
not
depart
till
their
will
is
accomplished
marat
came
up
presently
afterwards
at
the
head
of
a
select
band
of
a
hundred
ruffians
he
called
on
the
multitude
to
stand
firm
to
their
purpose
and
commanded
the
convention
in
the
name
of
the
people
to
return
to
their
place
of
meeting
to
deliberate
and
above
all
to
obey
the
convention
their
hall
in
the
last
degree
of
consternation
prepared
to
submit
to
the
infamy
which
now
seemed
inevitable
yet
loathing
themselves
for
their
cowardice
even
while
obeying
the
dictates
of
the
jacobins
meanwhile
enhanced
their
demand
like
her
who
sold
the
books
of
the
sibyls
instead
of
deputies
the
accusation
of
thirty
was
now
demanded
amid
terror
mingled
with
acclamations
the
decree
was
declared
to
be
carried
this
doom
of
proscription
passed
on
the
motion
of
couthon
a
decrepid
being
whose
lower
extremities
were
paralysed
whose
benevolence
of
feeling
seemed
to
pour
itself
out
in
the
most
gentle
expressions
uttered
in
the
most
melodious
tones
whose
sensibility
led
him
constantly
to
foster
a
favourite
spaniel
in
his
bosom
that
he
might
have
something
on
which
to
bestow
kindness
and
caresses
but
who
was
at
heart
as
fierce
as
danton
and
as
pitiless
as
robespierre
great
part
of
the
convention
did
not
join
in
this
vote
protesting
loudly
against
the
force
imposed
on
them
several
of
the
proscribed
deputies
were
arrested
others
escaped
from
the
hall
by
the
connivance
of
their
brethren
and
of
the
official
persons
attached
to
the
convention
some
foreseeing
their
fate
had
absented
themselves
from
the
meeting
and
were
already
fled
from
paris
thus
fell
without
a
blow
struck
or
sword
drawn
in
their
defence
the
party
in
the
convention
which
claimed
the
praise
of
acting
upon
pure
republican
principles
who
had
overthrown
the
throne
and
led
the
way
to
anarchy
merely
to
perfect
an
ideal
theory
they
fell
as
the
wisest
of
them
admitted
dupes
to
their
own
system
and
to
the
vain
and
impracticable
idea
of
ruling
a
large
and
corrupt
empire
by
the
motives
which
may
sway
a
small
and
virtuous
community
they
might
as
they
too
late
discovered
have
as
well
attempted
to
found
the
capitol
on
a
bottomless
and
quaking
marsh
as
their
pretended
republic
in
a
country
like
france
the
violent
revolutionary
expedients
the
means
by
which
they
acted
were
turned
against
them
by
men
whose
ends
were
worse
than
their
own
the
girondists
had
gloried
in
their
share
of
the
triumphs
of
the
of
august
yet
what
was
that
celebrated
day
save
an
insurrection
of
the
populace
against
the
constituted
authority
of
the
time
as
those
of
the
of
may
and
of
june
under
which
the
girondists
succumbed
were
directed
against
them
as
successors
in
the
government
in
the
one
case
a
king
was
dethroned
in
the
other
a
government
or
band
of
ministers
dismissed
and
if
the
people
had
a
right
as
the
girondists
claimed
in
their
behalf
to
act
as
the
executioners
of
their
own
will
in
the
one
instance
it
is
difficult
to
see
upon
what
principle
their
power
should
be
trammelled
in
the
other
in
the
important
process
against
the
king
the
girondists
had
shown
themselves
pusillanimous
desirous
to
save
the
life
of
a
guiltless
man
they
dared
not
boldly
vouch
his
innocence
but
sheltered
themselves
under
evasions
which
sacrificed
his
character
while
they
could
not
protect
his
life
after
committing
this
great
error
they
lost
every
chance
of
rallying
with
efficacy
under
their
standard
what
might
remain
of
individuals
in
paris
and
in
france
who
if
they
had
seen
the
girondists
when
in
power
conduct
themselves
with
firmness
would
probably
rather
have
ranked
themselves
in
the
train
of
men
who
were
friends
to
social
order
however
republican
their
tenets
than
have
given
way
to
the
anarchy
which
was
doomed
to
ensue
upon
all
their
own
faults
whether
of
act
or
of
omission
the
unfortunate
girondists
had
now
ample
time
to
meditate
of
their
leading
members
arrested
on
the
fatal
of
june
already
waited
their
doom
in
prison
while
the
others
wandered
on
in
distress
and
misery
through
the
different
departments
of
france
the
fate
of
those
who
were
prisoners
was
not
very
long
suspended
in
october
they
were
brought
to
trial
and
convicted
of
such
was
the
temper
of
france
at
the
time
and
so
gross
the
impositions
which
might
be
put
upon
the
people
that
the
men
in
the
empire
who
upon
abstract
principle
were
most
averse
to
monarchy
and
who
had
sacrificed
even
their
consciences
to
join
with
the
jacobins
in
pulling
down
the
throne
were
now
accused
and
convicted
of
being
royalists
and
that
at
a
time
when
what
remained
of
the
royal
family
was
at
so
low
an
ebb
that
the
imprisoned
queen
could
not
obtain
the
most
ordinary
book
for
the
use
of
her
son
without
a
direct
and
formal
application
to
the
community
of
paris
sidenote
fate
of
the
girondist
leaders
when
the
girondists
were
brought
before
the
tribunal
the
people
seem
to
have
shown
more
interest
in
men
whose
distinguished
talents
had
so
often
swayed
the
legislative
body
than
was
altogether
acceptable
to
the
jacobins
who
were
induced
to
fear
some
difficulty
in
carrying
through
their
conviction
they
obtained
a
decree
from
the
convention
declaring
that
the
president
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
should
be
at
liberty
to
close
the
procedure
so
soon
as
the
jury
should
have
made
up
their
minds
and
without
hearing
the
accused
in
their
defence
this
frightful
expedient
of
cutting
short
the
debate
la
was
the
phrase
was
often
resorted
to
on
those
revolutionary
trials
unquestionably
they
dreaded
the
reasoning
of
brissot
and
the
eloquence
of
vergniaud
of
which
they
had
so
long
and
so
often
experienced
the
thunders
one
crime
and
it
was
a
fatal
offence
considering
before
what
judicature
they
stood
seems
to
have
been
made
out
by
own
letters
it
was
that
by
which
the
late
members
attempted
to
effect
a
combination
among
the
departments
for
the
purpose
of
counterpoising
if
possible
the
tremendous
influence
which
the
capital
and
the
revolutionary
part
of
its
magistracy
exercised
over
the
convention
whom
paris
detained
prisoners
within
her
walls
this
delinquency
alone
was
well
calculated
to
remove
all
scruples
from
the
minds
of
a
jury
selected
from
that
very
class
of
parisians
whose
dreadful
importance
would
have
been
altogether
annihilated
by
the
success
of
such
a
scheme
the
accused
were
found
guilty
as
conspirators
against
the
unity
and
indivisibility
of
the
republic
and
the
liberty
and
safety
of
the
french
people
when
the
sentence
of
death
was
pronounced

of
their
number
valazé

in

suffered
in

conveyed

of
execution
in
the
same
tumbril

the
bloody
corpse
of
their
suicide
colleague
brissot
seemed
downcast
and
unhappy
fauchet
a
renegade
priest
showed
signs
of
remorse
the
rest
affected
a
roman
resolution
and
went
to
execution
singing
a
parody
on
the
hymn
of
the
marseillois
in
which
that
famous
composition
was
turned
against
the
jacobins
they
had
long
rejected
the
aids
of
religion
which
early
received
and
cherished
would
have
guided
their
steps
in
prosperity
and
sustained
them
in
adversity
their
remaining
stay
was
only
that
of
the
same
vain
and
speculative
philosophy
which
had
so
deplorably
influenced
their
political
conduct
those
members
of
the
girondist
party
who
escaping
from
paris
to
the
departments
avoided
their
fate
somewhat
longer
saw
little
reason
to
pride
themselves
on
the
political
part
they
had
chosen
to
act
they
found
the
eastern
and
southern
departments
in
a
ferment
against
paris
and
the
jacobins
and
ready
to
rise
in
arms
but
they
became
aware
at
the
same
time
that
no
one
was
thinking
of
or
regretting
their
system
of
a
pure
republic
the
motives
by
which
the
malecontents
were
agitated
being
of
a
very
different
and
far
more
practical
character
great
part
of
the
nation
all
at
least
of
better
feelings
had
been
deeply
affected
by
the
undeserved
fate
of
the
king
and
the
cruelty
with
which
his
family
had
been
and
were
still
treated
the
rich
feared
to
be
pillaged
and
murdered
by
the
jacobins
the
poor
suffered
no
less
under
scarcity
of
grain
under
the
depreciation
of
assignats
and
a
compulsory
levy
of
no
less
than
three
hundred
thousand
men
over
france
to
supply
the
enormous
losses
of
the
french
army
but
every
where
the
insurrections
took
a
royalist
and
not
a
republican
character
and
although
the
girondists
were
received
at
caen
and
elsewhere
with
compassion
and
respect
the
votes
they
had
given
in
the
king
trial
and
their
fanatic
zeal
for
a
kind
of
government
for
which
france
was
totally
unfitted
and
which
those
from
whom
they
obtained
refuge
were
far
from
desiring
prevented
their
playing
any
distinguished
part
in
the
disturbed
districts
of
the
west
buzot
seems
to
see
this
in
the
true
sense
it
is
certain
he
says
that
if
we
could
have
rested
our
pretensions
upon
having
wished
to
establish
in
france
a
moderate
government
of
that
character
which
according
to
many
persons
best
suited
the
people
of
france
indicating
a
limited
monarchy
we

one
of
which
continued
to
applaud

and

among

reprobated

the

excited
general
interest
in

and
a
strong
inclination
became
visible
among
the
higher
and
middling
classes
that
the
nation
should
take
up
arms
and
interfere
in
the
fate
of
the
unhappy
louis
pitt
had
been
making
up
his
mind
to
the

point
but
feeling
how
much
his
own
high
talents
were
turned
to
the
improvement
of
the
internal
regulations
and
finances
of
the
country
he
hesitated
for
some
time
to
adopt
a
hostile
course
though
approved
by
the
sovereign
and
demanded
by
a
large
proportion
of
his
subjects
but
new
circumstances
arose
every
day
to
compel
a
decision
on
this
important
point
the
french
whether
in
their
individual
or
collective
capacities
have
been
always
desirous
to
take
the
lead
among
european
nations
and
to
be
considered
as
the
foremost
member
of
the
civilized
republic
in
almost
all
her
vicissitudes
france
has
addressed
herself
as
much
to
the
citizens
of
other
countries
as
to
those
of
her
own
and
it
was
thus
that
in
the
speeches
of
her
statesmen
invitations
were
thrown
out
to
the
subjects
of
other
states
to
imitate
the
example
of
the
republic
cast
away
the
rubbish
of
their
old
institutions
dethrone
their
kings
demolish
their
nobility
divide
the
lands
of
the
church
and
the
aristocracy
among
the
lower
classes
and
arise
a
free
and
regenerated
people
in
britain
as
elsewhere
these
doctrines
carried
a
fascinating
sound
for
britain
as
well
as
france
had
men
of
parts
who
thought
themselves
neglected
men
of
merit
who
conceived
themselves
oppressed
experimentalists
who
would
willingly
put
the
laws
in
their
revolutionary
crucible
and
men
desirous
of
novelties
in
the
church
and
in
the
state
either
from
the
eagerness
of
restless
curiosity
or
the
hopes
of
bettering
by
the
change
above
all
britain
had
a
far
too
ample
mass
of
poverty
and
ignorance
subject
always
to
be
acted
upon
by
the
hope
of
license
affiliated
societies
were
formed
in
almost
all
the
towns
of
great
britain
they
corresponded
with
each
other
held
very
high
and
intimidating
language
and
seemed
to
frame
themselves
on
the
french
model
they
addressed
the
national
convention
of
france
directly
in
the
name
of
their
own
bodies
and
of
societies
united
for
the
same
purpose
and
congratulated
them
on
their
freedom
and
on
the
manner
in
which
they
had
gained
it
with
many
a
broad
hint
that
their
example
would
not
be
lost
on
britain
the
persons
who
composed
these
societies
had
generally
speaking
little
pretension
to
rank
or
influence
and
though
they
contained
some
men
of
considerable
parts
there
was
a
deficiency
of
any
thing
like
weight
or
respectability
in
their
meetings
their
consequence
lay
chiefly
in
the
numbers
who
were
likely
to
be
influenced
by
their
arguments
and
these
were
extraordinarily
great
especially
in
large
towns
and
in
the
manufacturing
districts
that
state
of
things
began
to
take
place
in
britain
which
had
preceded
the
french
revolution
but
the
british
aristocracy
well
cemented
together
and
possessing
great
weight
in
the
state
took
the
alarm
sooner
and
adopted
precautions
more
effectual
than
had
been
thought
of
in
france
they
associated
together
in
political
unions
on
their
side
and
by
the
weight
of
influence
character
and
fortune
soon
obtained
a
superiority
which
made
it
dangerous
or
at
least
inconvenient
to
many
whose
situations
in
society
rendered
them
in
some
degree
dependent
upon
the
favour
of
the
aristocracy
to
dissent
violently
from
their
opinions
the
political
shibboleth
used
by
these
associations
was
a
renunciation
of
the
doctrines
of
the
french
revolution
and
they
have
been
reproached
that
this
abhorrence
was
expressed
by
some
of
them
in
terms
so
strong
as
if
designed
to
withhold
the
subscribers
from
attempting
any
reformation
in
their
own
government
even
by
the
most
constitutional
means
in
short
while
the
democratical
party
made
in
their
clubs
the
most
violent
and
furious
speeches
against
the
aristocrats
the
others
became
doubly
prejudiced
against
reform
of
every
description
and
all
who
attempted
to
assert
its
propriety
after
all
had
this
political
ferment
broke
out
in
britain
at
any
other
period
or
on
any
other
occasion
it
would
have
probably
passed
away
like
other
of
the
same
description
which
interest
for
a
time
but
weary
out
the
public
attention
and
are
laid
aside
and
forgotten
but
the
french
revolution
blazed
in
the
neighbourhood
like
a
beacon
of
hope
to
the
one
party
of
fear
and
caution
to
the
other
the
shouts
of
the
democratic
triumphs
the
foul
means
by
which
their
successes
were
obtained
and
the
cruel
use
which
was
made
of
them
increased
the
animosity
of
both
parties
in
england
in
the
fury
of
party
zeal
the
democrats
excused
many
of
the
excesses
of
the
french
revolution
in
respect
of
its
tendency
while
the
other
party
in
condemning
the
whole
revolution
both
root
and
branch
forgot
that
after
all
the
struggle
of
the
french
nation
to
recover
their
liberty
was
in
its
commencement
not
only
justifiable
but
laudable
the
wild
and
inflated
language
addressed
by
the
french
statesmen
to
mankind
in
general
and
the
spirit
of
conquest
which
the
nation
had
lately
evinced
mixed
with
their
marked
desire
to
extend
their
political
principles
and
with
the
odium
which
they
had
heaped
upon
themselves
by
the

were
equally
reluctant
to

on

finally
without

dissentient
voice
the
whole

in

declared

upon

last
nation
is
nevertheless
sometimes
represented
even
at

as
having
declared
war
upon

in
fact
pitt
came
unwillingly
into
the
war
with
even
more
than
his
great
father
ministerial
talents
he
did
not
habitually
nourish
the
schemes
of
military
triumph
which
were
familiar
to
the
genius
of
chatham
and
was
naturally
unwilling
by
engaging
in
an
expensive
war
to
derange
those
plans
of
finance
by
which
he
had
retrieved
the
revenues
of
great
britain
from
a
very
low
condition
it
is
said
of
chatham
that
he
considered
it
as
the
best
economy
to
make
every
military
expedition
which
he
fitted
out
of
such
a
power
and
strength
as
to
overbear
as
far
as
possible
all
chance
of
opposition
a
general
officer
who
was
to
be
employed
in
such
a
piece
of
service
having
demanded
a
certain
body
of
troops
as
sufficient
to
effect
his
purpose
take
double
the
number
said
lord
chatham
and
answer
with
your
head
for
your
success
his
son
had
not
the
same
mode
of
computation
and
would
perhaps
have
been
more
willing
to
have
reduced
the
officer
terms
chaffered
with
him
for
the
lowest
number
and
finally
despatched
him
at
the
head
of
as
small
a
body
as
the
general
could
have
been
prevailed
on
to
consider
as
affording
any
prospect
of
success
this
untimely
economy
of
resources
arose
from
the
expense
attending
the
british
army
they
are
certainly
one
of
the
bravest
best
appointed
and
most
liberally
paid
in
europe
but
in
forming
demands
on
their
valour
and
expectations
from
their
exertions
their
are
apt
to
indulge
extravagant
computations
from
not
being
in
the
habit
of
considering
military
calculations
or
being
altogether
aware
of
the
numerical
superiority
possessed
by
other
countries
that
one
englishman
will
fight
two
frenchmen
is
certain
but
that
he
will
beat
them
though
a
good
article
of
the
popular
creed
must
be
allowed
to
be
more
dubious
and
it
is
not
wise
to
wage
war
on
such
odds
or
to
suppose
that
because
our
soldiers
are
infinitely
valuable
to
us
and
a
little
expensive
besides
it
is
therefore
judicious
to
send
them
in
small
numbers
against
desperate
odds
another
point
well
touched
by
sheridan
during
the
debate
on
the
question
of
peace
or
war
was
not
sufficiently
attended
to
by
the
british
administration
that
statesman
whose
perception
of
the
right
and
wrong
of
any
great
constitutional
question
was
as
acute
as
that
of
any
whomever
of
his
great
political
contemporaries
said
he
wished
every
possible
exertion
to
be
made
for
the
preservation
of
peace
if
however
that
were
impracticable
in
such
case
but
in
such
case
only
he
proposed
to
vote
for
a
vigorous
war
not
a
war
of
shifts
and
scraps
of
timid
operation
or
protracted
effort
but
a
war
conducted
with
such
energy
as
might
convince
the
world
that
we
were
contending
for
our
dearest
and
most
valuable
privileges
of
this
and
most
just
principle
the
policy
of
britain
unfortunately
lost
sight
during
the
first
years
of
the
war
when
there
occurred
more
than
one
opportunity
in
which
a
home
and
prostrating
blow
might
have
been
aimed
at
her
gigantic
adversary
a
gallant
auxiliary
army
was
however
immediately
fitted
out
and
embarked
for
holland
with
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
york
at
their
head
as
if
the
king
had
meant
to
give
to
his
allies
the
dearest
pledge
in
his
power
how
serious
was
the
interest
which
he
took
in
their
defence
but
though
well
equipped
and
commanded
under
the
young
prince
by
abercromby
dundas
sir
william
erskine
and
many
other
officers
of
gallantry
and
experience
it
must
be
owned
that
the
british
army
had
not
then
recovered
the
depressing
and
disorganizing
effects
of
the
american
war
the
soldiers
were
indeed
fine
men
on
the
parade
but
their
external
appearance
was
acquired
by
dint
of
a
thousand
minute
and
vexatious
attentions
exacted
from
them
at
the
expense
of
private
comfort
and
which
after
all
only
gave
them
the
exterior
appearance
of
high
drilling
in
exchange
for
ease
of
motion
and
simplicity
of
dress
no
general
system
of
manœuvres
we
believe
had
been
adopted
for
the
use
of
the
forces
each
commanding
officer
managed
his
regiment
according
to
his
own
pleasure
in
a
two
or
three
battalions
could
not
act
in
concert
without
much
previous
consultation
in
action
they
got
on
as
chance
directed
the
officers
too
were
acquainted
both
with
their
soldiers
and
with
their
duty
in
a
degree
far
inferior
to
what
is
now
exacted
from
them
our
system
of
purchasing
commissions
which
is
necessary
to
connect
the
army
with
the
country
and
the
property
of
the
country
was
at
that
time
so
much
abused
that
a
mere
beardless
boy
might
be
forced
at
once
through
the
subordinate
and
subaltern
steps
into
a
company
or
a
majority
without
having
been
a
month
in
the
army
in
short
all
those
gigantic
abuses
were
still
subsisting
which
the
illustrious
prince
whom
we
have
named
eradicated
from
the
british
army
by
regulations
for
which
his
country
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
and
without
which
they
could
never
have
performed
the
distinguished
part
finally
destined
to
them
in
the
terrible
drama
which
was
about
to
open
under
less
successful
auspices
there
hung
also
like
a
cloud
upon
the
military
fame
of
england
the
unfortunate
issue
of
the
american
struggle
in
which
the
advantages
obtained
by
regulars
against
less
disciplined
forces
had
been
trifled
with
in
the
commencement
until
the
genius
of
washington
and
the
increasing
spirit
and
numbers
of
the
continental
armies
completely
and
almost
annihilated
that
original
preponderance
yet
the
british
soldiery
did
not
disgrace
their
high
national
character
nor
show
themselves
unworthy
of
fighting
under
the
eye
of
the
son
of
their
monarch
and
when
they
joined
the
austrian
army
under
the
prince
of
gave
many
demonstrations
both
of
valour
and
discipline

storming
the
fortified
camp
of
the
french
at
famars

battle
of
lincelles
the
part
they
bore
in
the
sieges
of
valenciennes
and
condé
both
of
which
surrendered
successively
to
the
allied
forces
upheld
the
reputation
of
their
country
and
amounted
indeed
to
what
in
former
wars
would
have
been
the
fruits
of
a
very
successful
campaign
but
europe
was
now
arrived
at
a
time
when
war
was
no
longer
to
be
carried
on
according
to
the
old
usage
by
the
agency
of
standing
armies
of
moderate
numbers
when
a
battle
lost
and
won
or
a
siege
raised
or
successful
was
thought
sufficient
for
the
active
exertions
of
the
year

the
troops
on

side
were
drawn
off
into

quarters

diplomacy
took
up
the
contest
which
tactics
had
suspended
all
this
was
to
be
laid
aside

this
drowsy
state

hostility

were
to
contend

situation

part
in
the
pastime
in
a
word
the
two
divisions
of
society
depended
mutually
on
each
other
and
were
strongly
knit
together
by
ties
which
in
other
districts
of
france
existed
only
in
particular
instances
the
vendéan
peasant
was
the
faithful
and
attached
though
humble
friend
of
his
lord
he
was
his
partner
in
bad
and
good
fortune
submitted
to
his
decision
the
disputes
which
might
occur
betwixt
him
and
his
neighbours
and
had
recourse
to
his
protection
if
he
sustained
wrong
or
was
threatened
with
injustice
from
any
one
this
system
of
simple
and
patriarchal
manners
could
not
have
long
subsisted
under
any
great
inequality
of
fortune
accordingly
we
find
that
the
wealthiest
of
the
vendéan
nobility
did
not
hold
estates
worth
more
than
twelve
or
fifteen
hundred
while
the
lowest
might
be
three
or
four
hundred
they
were
not
accordingly
much
tempted
by
exuberance
of
wealth
to
seek
to
display
magnificence
and
such
as
went
to
court
and
conformed
to
the
fashions
of
the
capital
were
accustomed
to
lay
them
aside
in
all
haste
when
they
returned
to
the
bocage
and
to
reassume
the
simple
manners
of
their
ancestors
all
the
incentives
to
discord
which
abounded
elsewhere
through
france
were
wanting
in
this
wild
and
wooded
region
where
the
peasant
was
the
noble
affectionate
partner
and
friend
the
noble
the
natural
judge
and
protector
of
the
peasant
the
people
had
retained
the
feelings
of
the
ancient
french
in
favour
of
royalty
they
listened
with
dissatisfaction
and
disgust
to
the
accounts
of
the
revolution
as
it
proceeded
and
feeling
themselves
none
of
the
evils
in
which
it
originated
its
whole
tendency
became
the
object
of
their
alarm
and
suspicion
the
neighbouring
districts
and
bretagne
in
particular
were
agitated
by
similar
commotions
for
although
the
revolutionary
principles
predominated
in
the
towns
of
the
west
they
were
not
relished
by
the
country
people
any
more
than
by
the
nobles
great
agitation
had
for
some
time
taken
place
through
the
provinces
of
bretagne
anjou
maine
and
poitou
to
which
the
strength
of
the
insurrection
in
la
vendée
gave
impulse
it
was
not
however
a
political
impulse
which
induced
the
vendéans
to
take
the
field
the
influence
of
religion
seconded
by
that
of
natural
affection
was
the
immediate
stimulating
motive
in
a
country
so
simple
and
virtuous
in
its
manners
as
we
have
described
la
vendée
religious
devotion
must
necessarily
be
a
general
attribute
of
the
inhabitants
who
conscious
of
loving
their
neighbours
as
themselves
are
equally
desirous
to
the
extent
of
their
strength
and
capacity
to
love
and
honour
the
great
being
who
created
all
the
vendéans
were
therefore
very
regular
in
the
performance
of
their
prescribed
religious
duties
and
their
parish
priest
or
curé
held
an
honoured
and
influential
rank
in
their
little
society
was
the
attendant
of
the
of
the
peasant
as
well
for
rendering
medical
as
religious
aid
his
counsellor
in
his
family
affairs
and
often
the
arbiter
of
disputes
not
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
carried
before
the
seigneur
the
priests
were
themselves
generally
natives
of
the
country
more
distinguished
for
the
primitive
duty
with
which
they
discharged
their
office
than
for
talents
and
learning
the
curé
took
frequent
share
in
the
large
hunting
parties
which
he
announced
from
the
pulpit
and
after
having
said
mass
attended
in
person
with
the
on
his
shoulder
this
active
and
simple
manner
of
life
rendered
the
priests
predisposed
to
encounter
the
fatigues
of
war
they
accompanied
the
bands
of
vendéans
with
the
crucifix
displayed
and
promised
in
the
name
of
the
deity
victory
to
the
survivors
and
honour
to
those
who
fell
in
the
patriotic
combat
but
madame
la
repels
as
a
calumny
their
bearing
arms
except
for
the
purpose
of
almost
all
these
parish
priests
were
driven
from
their
cures
by
the
absurd
and
persecuting
fanaticism
of
that
decree
of
the
assembly
which
while
its
promoters
railed
against
illiberality
and
intolerance
deprived
of
their
office
and
of
their
livelihood
soon
after
of
liberty
and
life
those
churchmen
who
would
not
renounce
the
doctrines
in
which
they
had
been
educated
and
which
they
had
sworn
to
maintain
in
la
vendée
as
elsewhere
where
the
curates
resisted
this
unjust
and
impolitic
injunction
of
the
legislature
persecution
followed
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
was
met
in
its
turn
by
violence
on
that
of
the
people
the
peasants
maintained
in
secret
their
ancient
pastors
and
attended
their
ministry
in
woods
and
deserts
while
the
intruders
who
were
settled
in
the
livings
of
the
recusants
dared
hardly
appear
in
the
churches
without
the
protection
of
the
national
guards
so
early
as
when
dumouriez
commanded
the
forces
at
nantes
and
the
districts
adjacent
the
flame
of
dissension
had
begun
to
kindle
that
general
sagacity
induced
him
to
do
his
best
to
appease
the
quarrel
by
moderating
betwixt
the
parties
his
military
eye
detected
in
the
inhabitants
and
their
country
an
alarming
scene
for
civil
war
he
received
the
slightest
concessions
on
the
part
of
the
parish
priests
as
satisfactory
and
appears
to
have
quieted
the
disturbances
of
the
country
at
least
for
a
time
but
in
the
same
cause
of
discontent
added
to
others
hurried
the
inhabitants
of
la
vendée
into
a
general
insurrection
of
the
most
formidable
description
the
events
of
the
of
august
had
driven
from
paris
a
great
proportion
of
the
royalist
nobility
who
had
many
of
them
carried
their
discontents
and
their
projects
into
a
country
prepared
to
receive
and
adopt
them
then
followed
the
conventional
decree
which
supported
their
declaration
of
war
by
a
compulsory
levy
of
three
hundred
thousand
men
throughout
france
this
measure
was
felt
as
severe
by
even
those
departments
in
which
the
revolutionary
principles
were
most
predominant
but
was
regarded
as
altogether
intolerable
by
the
vendéans
averse
alike
to
the
republican
cause
and
principles
they
resisted
its
exaction
by
main
force
delivered
the
conscripts
in
many
instances
defeated
the
national
guards
in
others
and
finding
that
they
had
incurred
the
vengeance
of
a
sanguinary
government
resolved
by
force
to
maintain
the
resistance
which
in
force
had
begun
thus
originated
that
celebrated
war
which
raged
so
long
in
the
very
bosom
of
france
and
threatened
the
stability
of
her
government
even
while
the
republic
was
achieving
the
most
brilliant
victories
over
her
foreign
enemies
it
is
remote
from
our
purpose
to
trace
the
history
of
these
hostilities
but
a
sketch
of
their
nature
and
character
is
essential
to
a
general
view
of
the
revolution
and
the
events
connected
with
it
sidenote
la
charette
the
insurgents
though
engaged
in
the
same
cause
and
frequently
were
divided
into
different
bodies
under
leaders
independent
of
each
other
those
of
the
right
bank
of
the
loire
were
chiefly
under
the
orders
of
the
celebrated
la
charette
who
descended
from
a
family
distinguished
as
commanders
of
privateers
and
himself
a
naval
officer
had
taken
on
him
this
dangerous
command
an
early
wandering
disposition
not
unusual
among
youth
of
eager
and
ambitious
character
had
made
him
acquainted
with
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
woods
and
his
native
genius
had
induced
him
to
anticipate
the
military
advantages
which
they
afforded
in
his
case
as
in
many
others
either
the
sagacity
of
these
uninstructed
peasants
led
them
to
choose
for
command
men
whose
talents
best
fitted
them
to
enjoy
it
or
perhaps
the
perils
which
environed
such
authority
prevented
its
being
aspired
to
save
by
those
whom
a
mixture
of
resolution
and
prudence
led
to
feel
themselves
capable
of
maintaining
their
character
when
invested
with
it
it
was
remarkable
also
that
in
choosing
their
leaders
the
insurgents
made
no
distinction
between
the
noblesse
and
the
inferior
ranks
names
renowned
in
ancient
history
talmont
and
la
were
joined
in
equal
command
with
the
gamekeeper
stoflet
cathelineau
an
itinerant
la
charette
a
roturier
of
slight
pretensions
and
others
of
the
lowest
order
whom
the
time
and
the
public
voice
called
into
command
but
who
nevertheless
do
not
seem
in
general
to
have
considered
their
official
command
as
altering
the
natural
distinction
of
their
rank
in
society
in
their
success
they
formed
a
general
council
of
officers
priests
and
others
who
held
their
meetings
at
chatillon
and
directed
the
military
movements
of
the
different
bodies
assembled
them
at
pleasure
on
particular
points
and
for
particular
objects
of
service
and
dispersed
them
to
their
homes
when
these
were
accomplished
sidenote
war
of
la
vendée
with
an
organization
so
simple
the
vendéan
insurgents
in
about
two
months
possessed
themselves
of
several
towns
and
an
extensive
tract
of
country
and
though
repeatedly
attacked
by
regular
forces
commanded
by
experienced
generals
they
were
far
more
frequently
victors
than
vanquished
and
inflicted
more
loss
on
the
republicans
by
gaining
a
single
battle
than
they
themselves
sustained
in
repeated
defeats
yet
at
first
their
arms
were
of
the
most
simple
and
imperfect
kind
and
fusees
of
every
calibre
they
possessed
from
their
habits
as
huntsmen
and
fowlers
for
close
encounter
they
had
only
scythes
axes
clubs
and
such
weapons
as
anger
places
most
readily
in
the
hands
of
the
peasant
their
victories
latterly
supplied
them
with
arms
in
abundance
and
they
manufactured
gunpowder
for
their
own
use
in
great
quantity
their
tactics
were
peculiar
to
themselves
but
of
a
kind
so
well
suited
to
their
country
and
their
habits
that
it
seems
impossible
to
devise
a
better
and
more
formidable
system
the
vendéan
took
the
field
with
the
greatest
simplicity
of
military
equipment
his
scrip
served
as
a
cartridge
box
his
uniform
was
the
country
short
jacket
and
pantaloons
which
he
wore
at
his
ordinary
labour
a
cloth
knapsack
contained
bread
and
some
necessaries
and
thus
he
was
ready
for
service
they
were
accustomed
to
move
with
great
secrecy
and
silence
amongst
the
thickets
and
enclosures
by
which
their
country
is
intersected
and
were
thus
enabled
to
choose
at
pleasure
the
most
favourable
points
of
attack
or
defence
their
army
unlike
any
other
in
the
world
was
not
divided
into
companies
or
regiments
but
followed
in
bands
and
at
their
pleasure
the
chiefs
to
whom
they
were
most
attached
instead
of
drums
or
military
music
they
used
like
the
ancient
swiss
and
scottish
soldiers
the
horns
of
cattle
for
giving
signals
to
their
troops
their
officers
wore
for
distinction
a
sort
of
chequered
red
handkerchief
knotted
round
their
head
with
others
of
the
same
colour
tied
round
their
waist
by
way
of
sash
in
which
they
stuck
their
pistols
the
attack
of
the
vendéans
was
that
of
sharpshooters
they
dispersed
themselves
so
as
to
surround
their
adversaries
with
a
semicircular
fire
maintained
by
a
body
of
formidable
marksmen
accustomed
to
take
aim
with
fatal
precision
and
whose
skill
was
the
more
dreadful
because
being
habituated
to
take
advantage
of
every
tree
bush
or
point
of
shelter
those
who
were
dealing
destruction
amongst
others
were
themselves
comparatively
free
from
risk
this
manœuvre
was
termed
and
the
execution
of
it
resembling
the
indian
was
like
the
attack
of
the
red
warriors
accompanied
by
whoops
and
shouts
which
seemed
from
the
extended
space
through
which
they
resounded
to
multiply
the
number
of
the
assailants
when
the
republicans
galled
in
this
manner
pressed
forward
to
a
close
attack
they
found
no
enemy
on
which
to
wreak
their
vengeance
for
the
loose
array
of
the
vendéans
gave
immediate
passage
to
the
head
of
the
charging
column
while
its
flanks
as
it
advanced
were
still
more
exposed
than
before
to
the
murderous
fire
of
their
invisible
enemies
in
this
manner
they
were
sometimes
led
on
from
point
to
point
until
the
regulars
meeting
with
a
barricade
or
an
or
a
strong
position
in
front
or
becoming
perhaps
involved
in
a
defile
the
vendéans
exchanged
their
fatal
musketry
for
a
close
and
furious
onset
throwing
themselves
with
the
most
devoted
courage
among
the
enemy
ranks
and
slaughtering
them
in
great
numbers
if
on
the
other
hand
the
insurgents
were
compelled
to
give
way
a
pursuit
was
almost
as
dangerous
to
the
republicans
as
an
engagement
the
vendéan
when
hard
pressed
threw
away
his
clogs
or
wooden
shoes
of
which
he
could
make
himself
a
new
pair
at
the
next
sprang
over
a
fence
or
canal
loaded
his
fusee
as
he
ran
and
discharged
it
at
the
pursuer
with
a
fatal
aim
whenever
he
found
opportunity
of
pausing
for
that
purpose
this
species
of
combat
which
the
ground
rendered
so
advantageous
to
the
vendéans
was
equally
so
in
case
of
victory
or
defeat
if
the
republicans
were
vanquished
their
army
was
nearly
destroyed
for
the
preservation
of
order
became
impossible
and
without
order
their
extermination
was
inevitable
while
baggage
ammunition
carriages
guns
and
all
the
material
part
as
it
is
called
of
the
defeated
army
fell
into
possession
of
the
conquerors
on
the
other
hand
if
the
vendéans
sustained
a
loss
the
victors
found
nothing
on
the
field
but
the
bodies
of
the
slain
and
the
or
wooden
shoes
of
the
fugitives
the
few
prisoners
whom
they
made
had
generally
thrown
away
or
concealed
their
arms
and
their
army
having
no
baggage
or
carriages
of
any
kind
could
of
course
lose
none
pursuit
was
very
apt
to
convert
an
advantage
into
a
defeat
for
the
cavalry
could
not
act
and
the
infantry
dispersed
in
the
chase
became
frequent
victims
to
those
whom
they
pursued
in
the
field
the
vendéans
were
courageous
to
rashness
they
hesitated
not
to
attack
and
carry
artillery
with
no
other
weapons
than
their
staves
and
most
of
their
worst
losses
proceeded
from
their
attacking
fortified
towns
and
positions
with
the
purpose
of
carrying
them
by
main
force
after
conquest
they
were
in
general
humane
and
merciful
but
this
depended
on
the
character
of
their
chiefs
at
machecoul
the
insurgents
conducted
themselves
with
great
ferocity
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
civil
war
and
towards
the
end
of
it
mutual
and
reciprocal
injuries
had
so
exasperated
the
parties
against
each
other
that
quarter
was
neither
given
nor
taken
on
either
side
yet
until
provoked
by
the
extreme
cruelties
of
the
revolutionary
party
and
unless
when
conducted
by
some
peculiarly
ferocious
chief
the
character
of
the
vendéans
united
clemency
with
courage
they
gave
quarter
readily
to
the
vanquished
but
having
no
means
of
retaining
prisoners
they
usually
shaved
their
heads
before
they
set
them
at
liberty
that
they
might
be
distinguished
if
found
again
in
arms
contrary
to
their
parole
a
no
less
striking
feature
was
the
severity
of
a
discipline
respecting
property
which
was
taught
them
only
by
their
moral
sense
no
temptation
could
excite
them
to
pillage
and
madame
la
has
preserved
the
following
singular
instance
of
their
simple
honesty
after
the
peasants
had
taken
the
town
of
bressuire
by
storm
she
overheard
two
or
three
of
them
complain
of
the
want
of
tobacco
to
the
use
of
which
they
were
addicted
like
the
natives
of
moist
countries
in
general
what
said
the
lady
is
there
no
tobacco
in
the
shops
tobacco
enough
answered
the
and
honest
peasants
who
had
not
learned
to
make
steel
supply
the
want
of
gold
tobacco
enough
but
we
have
no
money
to
pay
for
it
amidst
these
primitive
warriors
were
mingled
many
gentlemen
of
the
first
families
in
france
who
royalists
from
principle
had
fled
to
la
vendée
rather
than
submit
to
the
dominion
of
the
convention
or
the
convention
yet
more
cruel
masters
there
were
found
many
men
the
anecdotes
told
of
whom
remind
us
continually
of
the
age
of
henri

and
the
heroes
of
chivalry
in
these
ranks
and
almost
on
a
level

of
the
insurrection
was
announced
in
the
title
of
the
royal
and
catholic
army
assumed
by
the
vendéans
in
their
moments
of
highest
hope
their
wishes
were
singularly
modest
had
they
gained
paris
and
replaced
the
royal
authority
in
france
they
meditated
the
following
simple
boons
they
had
resolved
to
petition
that
the
name
of
la
vendée
be
given
to
the
bocage
and
its
dependencies
which
should
be
united
under
a
separate
administration
instead
of
forming
as
at
present
a
part
of
three
distinct
provinces
that
the
restored
monarch
would
honour
the
bocage
with
a
visit
that
in
remembrance
of
the
loyal
services
of
the
country
a
white
flag
should
be
displayed
from
each
steeple
and
the
king
should
add
a
cohort
of
vendéans
to
his
that
former
useful
projects
of
improving
the
navigation
of
the
loire
and
its
canals
should
be
perfected
by
the
government
so
little
of
selfish
hope
or
ambition
was
connected
with
the
public
spirit
of
these
patriarchal
warriors
the
war
of
la
vendée
was
waged
with
various
fate
for
nearly
two
years
during
which
the
insurgents
or
brigands
as
they
were
termed
gained
by
far
the
greater
number
of
advantages
though
with
means
infinitely
inferior
to
those
of
the
government
which
detached
against
them
one
general
after
another
at
the
head
of
numerous
armies
with
equally
indifferent
success
most
of
the
republicans
intrusted
with
this
fatal
command
suffered
by
the
guillotine
for
not
having
done
that
which
circumstances
rendered
impossible
upwards
of
two
hundred
battles
and
skirmishes
were
fought
in
this
devoted
country
the
revolutionary
fever
was
in
its
access
the
shedding
of
blood
seemed
to
have
become
positive
pleasure
to
the
perpetrators
of
slaughter
and
was
varied
by
each
invention
which
cruelty
could
invent
to
give
it
new
zest
the
habitations
of
the
vendéans
were
destroyed
their
families
subjected
to
violation
and
massacre
their
cattle
houghed
and
slaughtered
and
their
crops
burnt
and
wasted
one
republican
column
assumed
and
merited
the
name
of
the
infernal
by
the
horrid
atrocities
which
they
committed
at
pillau
they
roasted
the
women
and
children
in
a
heated
oven
many
similar
horrors
could
be
added
did
not
the
heart
and
hand
recoil
from
the
task
without
quoting
any
more
special
instances
of
horror
we
use
the
words
of
a
republican
eyewitness
to
express
the
general
spectacle
presented
by
the
theatre
of
civil
conflict
i
did
not
see
a
single
male
being
at
the
towns
of
saint
hermand
chantonnay
or
herbiers
a
few
women
alone
had
escaped
the
sword
cottages
habitations
of
whichever
kind
were
burnt
the
herds
and
flocks
were
wandering
in
terror
around
their
usual
places
of
shelter
now
smoking
in
ruins
i
was
surprised
by
night
but
the
wavering
and
dismal
blaze
of
conflagration
afforded
light
over
the
country
to
the
bleating
of
the
disturbed
flocks
and
bellowing
of
the
terrified
cattle
was
joined
the
deep
hoarse
notes
of
carrion
crows
and
the
yells
of
wild
animals
coming
from
the
recesses
of
the
woods
to
prey
on
the
carcasses
of
the
slain
at
length
a
distant
column
of
fire
widening
and
increasing
as
i
approached
served
me
as
a
beacon
it
was
the
town
of
mortagne
in
flames
when
i
arrived
there
no
living
creatures
were
to
be
seen
save
a
few
wretched
women
who
were
striving
to
save
some
remnants
of
their
property
from
the
general
conflagration
such
is
civil
war
and
to
this
pass
had
its
extremities
reduced
the
smiling
peaceful
and
virtuous
country
which
we
have
described
a
few
pages
before
it
is
no
wonder
after
such
events
that
the
hearts
of
the
peasants
became
hardened
in
turn
and
that
they
executed
fearful
vengeance
on
those
who
could
not
have
the
face
to
expect
mercy
we
read
therefore
without
surprise
that
the
republican
general
haxo
a
man
of
great
military
talent
and
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
vendéan
war
shot
himself
through
the
head
when
he
saw
his
army
defeated
by
the
insurgents
rather
than
encounter
their
vengeance
during
the
superiority
of
the
vendéans
it
may
be
asked
why
their
efforts
so
gigantic
in
themselves
never
extended
beyond
the
frontier
of
their
own
country
and
why
an
insurrection
so
considerable
and
so
sustained
neither
made
any
great
impression
on
the
french
convention
where
they
were
spoken
of
only
as
a
handful
of
brigands
nor
on
foreign
nations
by
whom
their
existence
far
less
their
success
seems
hardly
to
have
been
known
on
the
former
subject
it
is
perhaps
sufficient
to
observe
that
the
war
of
the
vendéans
and
their
mode
of
conducting
it
so
formidable
in
their
own
country
became
almost
nugatory
when
extended
into
districts
of
an
open
character
and
affording
and
plains
by
which
cavalry
and
artillery
could
act
against
peasants
who
formed
no
close
ranks
and
carried
no
bayonets
besides
the
vendéans
remained
bound
to
their
ordinary
occupation
they
were
necessarily
children
of
the
soil
and
their
army
usually
dispersed
after
the
battle
was
over
to
look
after
their
cattle
cultivate
the
plot
of
arable
land
and
attend
to
their
families
the
discipline
of
their
array
in
which
mere
supplied
the
place
of
the
usual
distinctions
of
rank
would
not
have
been
sufficient
to
keep
them
united
in
long
and
distant
marches
and
they
must
have
found
the
want
of
a
commissariat
a
train
of
baggage
a
general
staff
and
all
the
other
accompaniments
of
a
regular
army
which
in
the
difficult
country
of
la
vendée
familiar
to
the
natives
and
unknown
to
strangers
could
be
so
easily
dispensed
with
in
a
word
an
army
which
under
circumstances
of
hope
and
excitation
might
one
day
amount
to
thirty
or
forty
thousand
and
on
the
next
be
diminished
to
the
tenth
part
of
the
number
might
be
excellent
for
fighting
battles
but
could
not
be
relied
on
for
making
conquests
or
securing
the
advantages
of
victory
it
is
not
but
that
a
man
of
knowledge
in
the
art
of
war
who
acted
as
one
of
their
principal
leaders
meditated
higher
objects
for
the
vendéans
than
merely
the
defence
of
their
own
province
a
superb
prospect
offered
itself
to
them
by
a
meditated
attack
on
the
town
of
nantes
upon
the
success
of
this
attempt
turned
perhaps
the
fate
of
the
revolution
this
beautiful
and
important
commercial
city
is
situated
on
the
right
bank
of
the
loire
which
is
there
a
fine
navigable
river
about
miles
from
its
junction
with
the
sea
it
is
without
fortifications
of
any
regular
description
but
had
a
garrison
of
perhaps
ten
thousand
men
and
was
covered
by
such
hasty
works
of
defence
as
time
had
permitted
them
to
erect
the
force
of
the
vendéans
by
which
it
was
attacked
has
been
estimated
so
high
as
thirty
or
forty
thousand
men
under
while
the
place
was
blockaded
on
the
left
bank
by
charette
and
an
army
of
royalists
equal
in
number
to
the
actual
assailants
had
this
important
place
been
gained
it
would
probably
have
changed
the
face
of
the
war
one
or
more
of
the
french
princes
might
have
resorted
there
with
such
adherents
as
they
had
then
in
arms
the
loire
was
open
to
succours
from
england
the
indecision
of
whose
cabinet
might
have
been
determined
by
a
success
so
important
bretagne
and
normandy
already
strongly
disposed
to
the
royal
cause
would
have
upon
such
encouragement
risen
in
mass
upon
the
republicans
and
as
poitou
and
anjou
were
already
in
possession
of
the
royal
and
catholic
army
they
might
probably
have
opened
a
march
upon
paris
distracted
as
the
capital
then
was
by
civil
and
foreign
war
accordingly
june
the
rockets
which
were
thrown
up
and
the
sound
of
innumerable
intimated
to
general
canclaux
who
commanded
the
town
that
he
was
to
repel
a
general
attack
of
the
vendéans
fortunately
for
the
infant
republic
he
was
a
man
of
military
skill
and
high
courage
and
by
his
dexterous
use
of
such
means
of
defence
as
the
place
afforded
and
particularly
by
a
great
superiority
of
artillery
he
was
enabled
to
baffle
the
attacks
of
the
vendéans
although
they
penetrated
with
the
utmost
courage
into
the
suburbs
and
engaged
at
close
quarters
the
republican
troops
they
were
compelled
to
retreat
after
a
fierce
combat
which
lasted
from
three
in
the
morning
till
four
in
the
afternoon
at
different
times
after
the
failure
of
this
bold
and
attempt
opportunities
occurred
during
which
the
allies
and
the
english
government
in
particular
might
have
thrown
important
succours
into
la
vendée
the
island
of
noirmoutier
was
for
some
time
in
possession
of
the
royalists
when
arms
and
money
might
have
been
supplied
to
them
to
any
amount
auxiliary
forces
would
probably
have
been
of
little
service
considering
in
what
sort
of
country
they
were
to
be
engaged
and
with
what
species
of
troops
they
were
to
act
at
least
it
would
have
required
the
talents
of
a
peterborough
or
a
montrose
in
a
foreign
commander
to
have
freed
himself
sufficiently
from
the
trammels
of
military
pedantry
and
availed
himself
of
the
peculiar
qualities
of
such
troops
as
the
vendéans
irresistible
after
their
own
fashion
but
of
a
character
the
most
opposite
possible
to
the
ideas
of
excellence
entertained
by
a
mere
martinet
sidenote
divisions
in
the
british
cabinet
but
it
is
now
well
known
there
was
a
division
in
the
british
cabinet
concerning
the
mode
of
carrying
on
the
war
pitt
was
extremely
unwilling
to
interfere
with
the
internal
government
of
france
he
desired
to
see
the
barrier
of
flanders
so
foolishly
thrown
open
by
the
emperor
joseph
again
and
he
hoped
from
the
success
of
the
allied
arms
that
this
might
be
attained
that
the
french
lust
for
attacking
their
neighbours
might
be
ended
their
wildness
for
crusading
in
the
cause
of
innovation
checked
and
some
political
advances
to
a
regular
government
effected
on
the
other
hand
the
enthusiastic
ingenious
but
somewhat
extravagant
opinions
of
windham
led
him
to
espouse
those
of
burke
in
their
utmost
extent
and
he
recommended
to
england
as
to
europe
the
replacing
the
bourbons
with
the
ancient
royal
government
and
constitution
as
the
fundamental
principle
on
which
the
war
should
be
waged
this
variance
of
opinion
so
far
divided
the
british
counsels
that
as
it
proved
no
sufficient
efforts
were
made
either
on
the
one
line
of
conduct
or
the
other
indeed
madame
la
who
however
we
are
apt
to
think
has
been
in
some
degree
misled
in
her
account
of
that
matter
says
the
only
despatches
received
by
the
vendéans
from
the
british
cabinet
indicated
a
singular
ignorance
of
the
state
of
la
vendée
which
was
certainly
near
enough
to
jersey
and
guernsey
to
have
afforded
the
means
of
obtaining
accurate
information
upon
the
nature
and
principles
of
the
vendéan
insurrection
the
leaders
of
royal
and
catholic
received
their
first
communication
from
britain
through
a
royalist
emissary
the
chevalier
de
tinténiac
who
carried
them
concealed
in
the
wadding
of
his
pistols
addressed
to
a
supposed
chief
named
gaston
whose
name
had
scarce
been
known
among
them
in
this
document
they
were
required
to
say
for
what
purpose
they
were
in
arms
whether
in
behalf
of
the
old
government
or
of
the
constitution
of
or
the
principles
of
the
girondists
these
were
strange
questions
to
be
asked
of
men
who
had
been
in
the
field
as
pure
royalists
for
more
than
five
months
who
might
have
reasonably
hoped
that
the
news
of
their
numerous
and
important
victories
had
resounded
through
all
europe
but
must
at
least
have
expected
they
should
be
well
known
to
those
neighbours
of
france
who
were
at
war
with
her
present
government
assistance
was
promised
but
in
a
general
and
indecisive
way
nor
did
the
testimony
of
de
tinténiac
give
his
friends
much
assurance
that
it
was
seriously
proposed
in
fact
no
support
ever
arrived
until
after
the
first
pacification
of
la
vendée
the
expedition
to
quiberon
delayed
until
the
cause
of
royalty
was
nigh
hopeless
was
at
length
undertaken
when
its
only
consequence
was
that
of
involving
in
absolute
destruction
a
multitude
of
brave
and
men
but
on
looking
back
on
a
game
so
doubtful
it
is
easy
to
criticize
the
conduct
of
the
players
and
perhaps
no
blunder
in
war
or
politics
is
so
common
as
that
which
arises
from
missing
the
proper
moment
of
exertion
the
french
although
more
able
to
seize
the
advantageous
opportunity
than
we
for
their
government
being
always
in
practice
something
despotic
is
at
liberty
to
act
more
boldly
secretly
and
decisively
than
that
of
england
are
nevertheless
chargeable
with
similar
errors
if
the
english
cabinet
missed
the
opportunities
given
by
the
insurrection
of
la
vendée
the
french
did
not
more
actively
improve
those
afforded
by
the
irish
rebellion
and
if
we
had
to
regret
the
too
tardy
and
unhappy
expedition
to
quiberon
they
in
their
turn
might
repent
having
thrown
away
the
troops
whom
they
landed
at
castlehaven
after
the
pacification
of
ireland
for
the
sole
purpose
it
would
seem
of
surrendering
at
ballinamuck
it
is
yet
more
wonderful
that
a
country
whose
dispositions
were
so
loyal
and
its
local
advantages
so
strong
should
not
have
been
made
by
the
loyalists
in
general
the
centre
of
those
exertions
which
were
vainly
expended
on
the
iron
eastern
frontier
where
the
fine
army
of
condé
wasted
their
blood
about
paltry
frontier
redoubts
and
fortresses
the
nobles
and
gentlemen
of
france
fighting
abreast
with
the
gallant
peasants
of
la
vendée
inspired
with
the
same
sentiments
of
loyalty
with
themselves
would
have
been
more
suitably
placed
than
in
the
mercenary
ranks
of
foreign
nations
it
is
certain
that
the
late
king
louis
and
also
his
present
majesty
were
desirous
to
have
exposed
their
persons
in
the
war
of
la
vendée
the
former
wrote
to
the
duke
what
course
remains
for
me
but
la
vendée
who
can
place
me
there
england
insist
upon
that
point
and
tell
the
english
ministers
in
my
name
that
i
demand
from
them
a
crown
or
a
tomb
if
there
were
a
serious
intention
of
supporting
these
unfortunate
princes
the
means
of
this
experiment
ought
to
have
been
afforded
them
and
that
upon
no
stinted
scale
the
error
of
england
through
all
the
early
part
of
the
war
was
an
unwillingness
to
proportion
her
efforts
to
the
importance
of
the
ends
she
had
in
view
looking
upon
the
various
chances
which
might
have
befriended
the
unparalleled
exertions
of
the
vendéans
considering
the
generous
virtuous
and
disinterested
character
of
those
primitive
soldiers
it
is
with
sincere
sorrow
that
we
proceed
to
trace
their
extermination
by
the
bloodthirsty
ruffians
of
the
reign
of
terror
yet
the
course
of
providence
after
the
lapse
of
time
is
justified
even
in
our
weak
and
undiscerning
eyes
we
should
indeed
have
read
with
hearts
throbbing
with
the
just
feelings
of
gratified
vengeance
that
la
charette
or
la
had
successfully
achieved
at
the
head
of
their
gallant
adherents
the
road
to
paris
had
broke
in
upon
the
committees
of
public
safety
and
public
security
like
thalaba
the
destroyer
into
the
and
with
the
same
dreadful
result
to
the
agents
of
the
horrors
with
which
these
revolutionary
bodies
had
deluged
france
but
such
a
reaction
accomplished
solely
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
the
old
despotic
monarchy
could
not
have
brought
peace
to
france
or
to
europe
nay
could
only
have
laid
a
foundation
for
farther
and
more
lasting
quarrels
the
flame
of
liberty
had
been
too
widely
spread
in
france
to
be
quenched
even
by
such
a
triumph
of
royalty
as
we
have
supposed
however
pure
the
principles
and
high
the
spirit
of
the
vendéans
it
was
necessary
that
the
nation
should
experience
both
the
extremes
of
furious
license
and
of
stern
despotism
to
fix
the
hopes
of
the
various
contending
parties
upon
a
form
of
government
in
which
a
limited
power
in
the
monarch
should
be
united
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
rational
freedom
in
the
subject
we
return
to
our
sad
task
sidenote
war
of
la
vendée
notwithstanding
the
desolating
mode
in
which
the
republicans
conducted
the
war
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
rendering
la
vendée
uninhabitable
the
population
seemed
to
increase
in
courage
and
even
in
numbers
as
their
situation
became
more
desperate
renewed
armies
were
sent
into
the
devoted
district
and
successively
destroyed
in
assaults
skirmishes
and
ambuscades
where
they
were
not
slaughtered
in
general
actions
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
men
were
employed
at
one
time
in
their
efforts
to
subjugate
this
devoted
province
but
this
could
not
last
for
ever
and
a
chance
of
war
upon
the
frontiers
which
threatened
reverses
to
the
convention
compensated
them
by
furnishing
new
forces
and
of
a
higher
description
in
point
of
character
and
discipline
for
the
subjection
of
la
vendée
this
was
the
surrender
of
the
town
of
mentz
to
the
prussians
by
the
capitulation
a
garrison
of
near
fifteen
thousand
experienced
soldiers
and
some
officers
of
considerable
name
were
debarred
from
again
bearing
arms
against
the
allies
these
troops
were
employed
in
la
vendée
where
the
scale
had
already
begun
to
preponderate
against
the
dauntless
and
persevering
insurgents
at
the
first
encounters
the
soldiers
of
mentz
unacquainted
with
the
vendéan
mode
of
fighting
sustained
loss
and
were
thought
lightly
of
by
the
royalists
this
opinion
of
their
new
adversaries
was
changed
in
consequence
of
a
defeat
near
chollet
more
dreadful
in
its
consequences
than
any
which
the
vendéans
had
yet
received
and
which
determined
their
generals
to
pass
the
loire
with
their
whole
collected
force
leave
their
beloved
bocage
to
the
axes
and
brands
of
the
victors
and
carry
the
war
into
bretagne
where
they
expected
either
to
be
supported
by
a
descent
of
the
english
or
by
a
general
insurrection
of
the
inhabitants
in
this
military
emigration
the
royalists
were
accompanied
by
their
aged
people
their
wives
and
their
children
so
that
their
melancholy
march
resembled
that
of
the
cimbrians
or
helvetians
of
old
when
abandoning
their
ancient
dwellings
they
wandered
forth
to
find
new
settlements
in
a
more
fertile
land
they
crossed
the
river
near
saint
florent
and
the
banks
were
blackened
with
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
pilgrims
of
both
sexes
and
of
every
age
the
broad
river
was
before
them
and
behind
them
their
burning
cottages
and
the
exterminating
sword
of
the
republicans
the
means
of
embarkation
were
few
and
precarious
the
affright
of
the
females
almost
ungovernable
and
such
was
the
tumult
and
terror
of
the
scene
that
in
the
words
of
madame
la
the
spectators
could
only
compare
it
to
the
day
of
judgment
without
food
directions
or
organization
of
any
kind
without
the
show
of
an
army
saving
in
the
front
and
rear
of
the
column
the
centre
consisting
of
their
defenceless
families
marching
together
in
a
mass
these
indomitable
peasants
defeated
a
republican
army
under
the
walls
of
laval
the
garrison
of
mentz
whose
arrival
in
la
vendée
had
been
so
fatal
to
the
insurgents
and
who
had
pursued
them
in
a
state
of
rout
as
they
thought
out
of
their
own
country
across
the
loire
were
almost
exterminated
in
this
most
unexpected
defeat
an
unsuccessful
attack
upon
granville
more
than
counterbalanced
this
advantage
and
although
the
vendéans
afterwards
obtained
a
brilliant
victory
at
dol
it
was
the
last
success
of
what
was
termed
the
great
army
of
la
vendée
and
which
well
deserved
that
title
on
more
accounts
than
in
its
more
ordinary
sense
they
had
now
lost
by
the
chances
of
war
most
of
their
best
chiefs
and
misfortunes
and
the
exasperating
feelings
attending
them
had
introduced
disunion
which
had
been
so
long
a
stranger
to
their
singular
association
charette
was
reflected
upon
as
being
little
willing
to
aid
la
and
stoflet
seems
to
have
set
up
an
independent
standard
the
insurgents
were
defeated
at
mons
where
of
three
republican
generals
of
name
westermann
marçeau
and
kleber
the
first
disgraced
himself
by
savage
cruelty
and
the
other
two
gained
honour
by
their
clemency
fifteen
thousand
male
and
female
natives
of
la
vendée
perished
in
the
battle
and
the
massacre
which
ensued
but
though
la
vendée
after
this
decisive
loss
which
included
some
of
her
best
troops
and
bravest
generals
could
hardly
be
said
to
exist
la
charette
continued
with
indefatigable
diligence
and
undaunted
courage
to
sustain
the
insurrection
of
lower
poitou
and
bretagne
he
was
followed
by
a
division
of
peasants
from
the
marais
whose
activity
in
marshy
grounds
gave
them
similar
advantages
to
those
possessed
by
the
vendéans
in
their
woodlands
he
was
followed
also
by
the
inhabitants
of
morbihan
called
from
their
adherence
to
royalism
the
little
la
vendée
he
was
the
leader
besides
of
many
of
the
bands
called
chouans
a
name
of
doubtful
origin
given
to
the
insurgents
of
bretagne
but
which
their
courage
has
rendered
celebrated
la
charette
himself
who
with
these
and
other
forces
continued
to
sustain
the
standard
of
royalty
in
bretagne
and
poitou
was
one
of
those
extraordinary
characters
made
to
shine
amidst
difficulties
and
dangers
as
prudent
and
cautious
as
he
was
courageous
and
adventurous
he
was
at
the
same
time
so
alert
and
expeditious
in
his
motions
that
he
usually
appeared
at
the
time
and
place
where
his
presence
was
least
expected
and
most
formidable
a
republican
officer
who
had
just
taken
possession
of
a
village
and
was
speaking
of
the
royalist
leader
as
of
a
person
at
twenty
leagues
distance
said
publicly
i
should
like
to
see
this
famous
charette
there
he
is
said
a
woman
pointing
with
her
finger
in
fact
he
was
at
that
moment
in
the
act
of
charging
the
republican
troops
who
were
all
either
slain
or
made
prisoners
sidenote
treaty
with
la
charette
after
the
fall
of
robespierre
the
convention
made
offers
of
pacification
to
la
charette
which
were
adjusted
betwixt
the
vendéan
chief
and
general
canclaux
the
heroic
defender
of
nantes
the
articles
of
treaty
were
subscribed
in
that
place
which
la
charette
entered
at
the
head
of
his
military
staff
with
his
long
white
plume
streaming
in
the
wind
he
heard
with
coldness
shouts
of
welcome
from
a
city
to
which
his
name
had
been
long
a
terror
and
there
was
a
gloom
on
his
brow
as
he
signed
his
name
to
the
articles
agreed
upon
he
certainly
suspected
the
faith
of
those
with
whom
he
transacted
and
they
did
not
by
any
means
confide
in
his
an
armistice
was
agreed
on
until
the
convention
should
ratify
the
pacification
but
this
never
took
place
mutual
complaints
and
recriminations
followed
and
the
soldiers
of
la
charette
and
of
the
republic
began
once
more
to
make
a
petty
war
on
each
other
meantime
that
party
in
the
british
cabinet
which
declared
for
a
descent
on
france
in
name
and
on
behalf
of
the
successor
to
the
crown
had
obtained
the
acquiescence
of
their
colleagues
in
an
experiment
of
this
nature
but
unhappily
it
had
been
postponed
until
its
success
had
become
impossible
the
force
too
which
composed
this
experimental
operation
was
injudiciously
selected
a
certain
proportion
consisted
of
emigrants
in
whom
the
highest
confidence
might
be
with
justice
reposed
but
about
two
battalions
of
this
invading
expedition
were
vagrant
foreigners
of
various
descriptions
many
or
most
of
them
enlisted
from
among
the
prisoners
of
war
who
readily
took
any
engagement
to
get
out
of
captivity
with
the
mental
resolution
of
breaking
it
the
first
opportunity
besides
these
imprudences
the
purpose
and
time
of
executing
a
project
which
to
be
successful
should
have
been
secret
and
sudden
were
generally
known
in
france
and
england
before
the
expedition
weighed
anchor
the
event
as
is
universally
known
was
most
disastrous
the
mercenaries
deserted
to
the
republicans
as
soon
as
they
got
ashore
and
the
unfortunate
emigrants
who
became
prisoners
in
great
numbers
were
condemned
and
executed
without
mercy
the
ammunition
and
muskets
of
which
a
quantity
had
been
landed
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
what
was
worse
england
did
not
among
other
lighter
losses
entirely
save
her
honour
she
was
severely
censured
as
giving
up
her
allies
to
destruction
because
she
had
yielded
to
the
wishes
which
enthusiastic
and
courageous
men
had
elevated
into
hope
nothing
indeed
can
be
more
difficult
than
to
state
the
just
extent
of
support
which
can
prudently
be
extended
by
one
nation
to
a
civil
faction
in
the
bosom
of
another
indeed
nothing
short
of
success
absolute
success
will
prove
the
justification
of
such
enterprises
in
the
eyes
of
some
who
will
allege
in
the
event
of
failure
that
men
have
been
enticed
into
perils
in
which
they
have
not
been
adequately
supported
or
of
others
who
will
condemn
such
measures
as
squandering
the
public
resources
in
enterprises
which
ought
not
to
have
been
encouraged
at
all
but
in
fair
judgment
the
expedition
of
quiberon
ought
not
to
be
summarily
condemned
it
was
neither
inadequate
nor
excepting
as
to
the
description
of
some
of
the
forces
employed
ill
calculated
for
the
service
proposed
had
such
reinforcements
and
supplies
arrived
while
the
royalists
were
attacking
nantes
or
grenoble
or
while
they
yet
held
the
island
of
noirmoutier
the
good
consequences
to
the
royal
cause
might
have
been
incalculable
but
the
expedition
was
and
that
was
in
a
great
measure
owing
to
those
unfortunate
gentlemen
engaged
who
impatient
of
inactivity
and
sanguine
by
character
urged
the
british
ministry
or
rather
windham
to
authorise
the
experiment
without
fully
considering
more
than
their
own
zeal
and
courage
we
can
not
however
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
their
impatience
relieved
ministers
from
the
responsibility
attached
to
the
indifferent
intelligence
on
which
they
acted
there
could
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
full
information
on
the
state
of
bretagne
by
way
of
jersey
and
they
ought
to
have
known
that
there
was
a
strong
french
force
collected
from
various
garrisons
for
the
purpose
of
guarding
against
a
descent
at
quiberon
after
this
unfortunate
affair
and
some
subsequent
vain
attempts
to
throw
in
supplies
on
the
part
of
the
english
la
charette
still
continued
in
open
war
but
hoche
an
officer
of
high
reputation
was
now
sent
into
the
disturbed
districts
with
a
larger
army
than
had
yet
been
employed
against
them
he
was
thus
enabled
to
form
moveable
columns
which
acted
in
concert
supporting
each
other
when
unsuccessful
or
completing
each
other
victory
when
such
was
obtained
la
charette
after
his
band
was
almost
entirely
destroyed
was
himself
made
prisoner
being
condemned
to
be
shot
he
refused
to
have
his
eyes
covered
and
died
as
courageously
as
he
had
lived
with
him
and
stoflet
who
suffered
a
similar
fate
the
war
of
la
vendée
terminated
to
trace
this
remarkable
civil
war
even
so
slightly
as
we
have
attempted
the
task
has
carried
us
beyond
the
course
of
our
narrative
it
broke
out
in
the
beginning
of
march
and
la
execution
by
which
it
was
closed
took
place
at
nantes
march
the
astonishing
part
of
the
matter
is
that
so
great
a
conflagration
should
not
have
extended
itself
beyond
a
certain
limited
district
while
within
that
region
it
raged
with
such
fury
that
for
a
length
of
time
no
means
of
extinguishing
it
could
be
discovered
sidenote

we
now
return
to
the
state
of
france
in
spring
when
the
jacobins
who
had
possessed
themselves
of
the
supreme
power
of
the
republic
found
that
they
had
to
contend
not
only
with
the
allied
forces
on
two
frontiers
of
france
and
with
the
royalists
in
the
west
but
also
with
more
than
one
of
the
great
commercial
towns
which
with
less
inclination
to
the
monarchical
cause
than
a
general

maritime
situation
and
in
the
case
of
lyons
from
their
command
of
internal
navigation
the
wealthy
merchants
and
manufacturers
of
those
cities
foresaw
the
total
insecurity
of
property
and
in
consequence
their
own
ruin
in
the
system
of
arbitrary
spoliation
and
murder
upon
which
the
government
of
the
jacobins
was
founded
but
property
for
which
they
were
solicitous
though
if
its
natural
force
is
used
in
time
the
most
powerful
barrier
to
withstand

becomes
after
a
certain
period
of
delay
its
most
helpless
victim

the
rich
are
in

those
among

if
they
see
their
superiors
dejected
and
despairing
will
be
tempted
to
consider

as
objects

this
must
be
done
early
or
those
who
might
be
made
the
most
active
defenders

will
join
with
such
as
are
prepared
to
make

have
already
seen

ventured
to
hope
for
a

purely
republican

effectually
disappointed
their

most
ferocious

one
of
the
most
extravagantly
absurd
of

jacobins
he
was
at
the
head
of
a
formidable
club
which
was
worthy
of
being
affiliated
with
the
mother

and
ambitious
of
treading
in
its
footsteps
and
he
was
supported
by
a
garrison
of
two
revolutionary
regiments
besides
a
numerous
artillery
and
a
large
addition
of
volunteers
amounting
in
all
to
about
ten
thousand

called

had
been
created

had
imposed
on

wealthy

tax

was
raised
from
six

thirty

destined

of
their
triumph
they
were
not
sufficiently
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
vengeance
which
they
had
provoked
or
of
the
necessity
of
supporting
the
bold
step
which
they
had
taken
by
measures
which
precluded
a
compromise
their
resistance
to
the
violence
and
atrocity
of
the
jacobins
had
no
political
character
any
more
than
that
offered
by
the
traveller
against
robbers
who
threaten
him
with
plunder
and
murder
they
were
not
sufficiently
aware
that
having
done
so
much
they
must
necessarily
do
more
they
ought
by
declaring
themselves
royalists
to
have
endeavoured
to
prevail
on
the
troops
of
savoy
if
not
on
the
swiss
who
had
embraced
a
species
of
neutrality
which
after
the
of
august
was
dishonourable
to
their
ancient
reputation
to
send
in
all
haste
soldiery
to
the
assistance
of
a
city
which
had
no
fortifications
or
regular
troops
to
defend
it
but
which
possessed
nevertheless
treasures
to
pay
their
auxiliaries
and
strong
hands
and
able
officers
to
avail
themselves
of
the
localities
of
their
situation
which
when
well
defended
are
sometimes
as
formidable
as
the
regular
protection
erected
by
scientific
engineers
the
people
of
lyons
vainly
endeavoured
to
establish
a
revolutionary
character
for
themselves
upon
the
system
of
the
gironde
two
of
whose
proscribed
deputies
biroteau
and
chasset
tried
to
draw
them
over
to
their
unpopular
and
hopeless
cause
and
they
inconsistently
sought
protection
by
affecting
a
republican
zeal
even
while
resisting
the
decrees
and
defeating
the
troops
of
the
jacobins
there
were
undoubtedly
many
of
royalist
principles
among
the
insurgents
and
some
of
their
leaders
were
decidedly
such
but
these
were
not
numerous
or
influential
enough
to
establish
the
true
principle
of
open
resistance
and
the
ultimate
chance
of
rescue
by
a
bold
proclamation
of
the
interest
they
still
appealed
to
the
convention
as
their
legitimate
sovereign
in
whose
eyes
they
endeavoured
to
vindicate
themselves
and
at
the
same
time
tried
to
secure
the
interest
of
two
jacobin
deputies
who
had
countenanced
every
violence
attempted
by
châlier
that
they
might
prevail
upon
them
to
represent
their
conduct
favourably
of
course
they
had
enough
of
promises
to
this
effect
while
guathier
and
nioche
the
deputies
in
question
remained
in
their
power
promises
doubtless
the
more
readily
given
that
the
lyonnois
though
desirous
to
conciliate
the
favour
of
the
convention
did
not
hesitate
in
proceeding
to
the
punishment
of
the
jacobin
châlier
he
was
condemned
and
executed
along
with
one
of
his
principal
associates
termed
ribard
to
defend
these
vigorous
proceedings
the
unhappy
insurgents
placed
themselves
under
the
interim
government
of
a
council
who
still
desirous
to
temporize
and
maintain
the
revolutionary
character
termed
themselves
the
popular
and
republican
commission
of
public
safety
of
the
department
of
the
rhone
and
loire
a
title
which
while
it
excited
no
popular
enthusiasm
and
attracted
no
foreign
aid
noways
soothed
but
rather
exasperated
the
resentment
of
the
convention
now
under
the
absolute
domination
of
the
jacobins
by
whom
every
thing
short
of
complete
fraternization
was
accounted
presumptuous
defiance
those
who
were
not
with
them
it
was
their
policy
to
hold
as
their
most
decided
enemies
the
lyonnois
had
indeed
letters
of
encouragement
and
promised
concurrence
from
several
departments
but
no
effectual
support
was
ever
directed
towards
their
city
excepting
the
petty
reinforcement
from
marseilles
which
we
have
seen
was
intercepted
and
dispersed
with
little
trouble
by
the
jacobin
general
cartaux
lyons
had
expected
to
become
the
patroness
and
focus
of
an
league
formed
by
the
great
commercial
towns
against
paris
and
the
predominant
part
of
the
convention
she
found
herself
isolated
and
unsupported
and
left
to
oppose
her
own
proper
forces
and
means
of
defence
to
an
army
of
sixty
thousand
men
and
to
the
numerous
jacobins
contained
within
her
own
walls
about
the
end
of
july
after
a
lapse
of
an
interval
of
two
months
a
regular
blockade
was
formed
around
the
city
and
in
the
first
week
of
august
hostilities
took
place
the
besieging
army
was
directed
in
its
military
character
by
general
kellerman
who
with
other
distinguished
soldiers
had
now
begun
to
hold
an
eminent
rank
in
the
republican
armies
but
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
vengeance
for
which
they
thirsted
the
jacobins
relied
chiefly
on
the
exertions
of
the
deputies
they
had
sent
along
with
the
commander
and
especially
of
the
representative
a
man
whose
sole
merit
appears
to
have
been
his
frantic
jacobinism
general
précy
formerly
an
officer
in
the
royal
service
undertook
the
almost
hopeless
task
of
defence
and
by
forming
redoubts
on
the
most
commanding
situations
around
the
town
commenced
a
resistance
against
the
immensely
superior
force
of
the
besiegers
which
was
honourable
if
it
could
have
been
useful
the
lyonnois
at
the
same
time
still
endeavoured
to
make
fair
weather
with
the
besieging
army
by
representing
themselves
as
firm
republicans
they
celebrated
as
a
public
festival
the
anniversary
of
the
of
august
while
to
show
the
credit
he
gave
them
for
their
republican
zeal
fixed
the
same
day
for
commencing
his
fire
on
the
place
and
caused
the
first
gun
to
be
discharged
by
his
own
concubine
a
female
born
in
lyons
bombs
and
bullets
were
next
resorted
to
against
the
second
city
of
the
french
empire
while
the
besieged
sustained
the
attack
with
a
constancy
and
on
many
parts
repelled
it
with
a
courage
highly
honourable
to
their
character
but
their
fate
was
determined
the
deputies
announced
to
the
convention
their
purpose
of
pouring
their
instruments
of
havoc
on
every
quarter
of
the
town
at
once
and
when
it
was
on
fire
in
several
places
to
attempt
a
general
storm
the
city
they
said
must
surrender
or
there
shall
not
remain
one
stone
upon
another
and
this
we
hope
to
accomplish
in
spite
of
the
suggestions
of
false
compassion
do
not
then
be
surprised
when
you
shall
hear
that
lyons
exists
no
longer
the
fury
of
the
attack
threatened
to
make
good
these
promises
in
the
meantime
the
piedmontese
troops
made
a
show
of
descending
from
their
mountains
to
the
succour
of
the
city
and
it
is
probable
their
interference
would
have
given
a
character
of
royalism
to
the
insurrection
but
the
incursion
of
the
piedmontese
and
sardinians
was
speedily
repelled
by
the
skill
of
kellerman
and
produced
no
effect
in
favour
of
the
city
of
lyons
except
that
of
supporting
for
a
time
the
courage
of
its
defenders
the
sufferings
of
the
citizens
became
intolerable
several
quarters
of
the
city
were
on
fire
at
the
same
time
immense
magazines
were
burnt
to
the
ground
and
a
loss
incurred
during
two
nights
bombardment
which
was
calculated
at
two
hundred
millions
of
livres
a
black
flag
was
hoisted
by
the
besieged
on
the
great
hospital
as
a
sign
that
the
fire
of
the
assailants
should
not
be
directed
on
that
asylum
of
hopeless
misery
the
signal
seemed
only
to
draw
the
republican
bombs
to
the
spot
where
they
could
create
the
most
frightful
distress
and
outrage
in
the
highest
degree
the
feelings
of
humanity
the
devastations
of
famine
were
soon
added
to
those
of
slaughter
and
after
two
months
of
such
horrors
had
been
sustained
it
became
obvious
that
farther
resistance
was
impossible
the
military
commandant
of
lyons
précy
resolved
upon
a
sally
at
the
head
of
the
active
part
of
the
garrison
hoping
that
by
cutting
his
way
through
the
besiegers
he
might
save
the
lives
of
many
of
those
who
followed
him
in
the
desperate
attempt
and
gain
the
neutral
territory
of
switzerland
while
the
absence
of
those
who
had
been
actual
combatants
during
the
siege
might
in
some
degree
incline
the
convention
to
lenient
measures
towards
the
more
helpless
part
of
the
inhabitants
a
column
of
about
two
thousand
men
made
this
desperate
attempt
but
pursued
by
the
republicans
and
attacked
on
every
side
by
the
peasants
to
whom
they
had
been
represented
in
the
most
odious
colours
by
the
jacobin
deputies
and
who
were
stimulated
besides
by
the
hope
of
plunder
scarcely
fifty
of
the
devoted
body
reached
with
their
leader
the
protecting
soil
of
switzerland
lyons
reluctantly
opened
her
gates
after
the
departure
of
her
best
and
bravest
the
rest
may
be
described
in
the
words
of
horace
barbarus
heu
cineres
insistet
victor
et
urbem
dissipabit
insolens
the
paralytic
couthon
with
collot
and
other
deputies
were
sent
to
lyons
by
the
committee
of
public
safety
to
execute
the
vengeance
which
the
jacobins
demanded
while
was
recalled
for
having
put
it
was
thought
less
energy
in
his
proceedings
than
the
prosecution
of
the
siege
required
collot
had
a
personal
motive
of
a
singular
nature
for
delighting
in
the
task
intrusted
to
him
and
his
colleagues
in
his
capacity
of
a
he
had
been
hissed
from
the
stage
at
lyons
and
the
door
to
revenge
was
now
open
the
instructions
of
this
committee
enjoined
them
to
take
the
most
satisfactory
revenge
for
the
death
of
châlier
and
the
insurrection
of
lyons
not
merely
on
the
citizens
but
on
the
town
itself
the
principal
streets
and
buildings
were
to
be
levelled
with
the
ground
and
a
monument
erected
where
they
stood
was
to
record
the
cause
rebelled
against
the
is
no
such
fragments
of
the
town
as
might
be
permitted
to
remain
were
to
bear
the
name
of
it
will
scarcely
be
believed
that
a
doom
like
that
which
might
have
passed
the
lips
of
some
eastern
despot
in
all
the
frantic
madness
of
arbitrary
power
and
utter
ignorance
could
have
been
seriously
pronounced
and
as
seriously
enforced
in
one
of
the
most
civilized
nations
in
europe
and
that
in
the
present
enlightened
age
men
who
pretended
to
wisdom
and
philosophy
should
have
considered
the
labours
of
the
architect
as
a
proper
subject
of
punishment
so
it
was
however
and
to
give
the
demolition
more
effect
the
impotent
couthon
was
carried
from
house
to
house
devoting
each
to
ruin
by
striking
the
door
with
a
silver
hammer
and
pronouncing
these
words
house
of
a
rebel
i
condemn
thee
in
the
name
of
the
law
workmen
followed
in
great
multitudes
who
executed
the
sentence
by
pulling
the
house
down
to
the
foundations
this
wanton
demolition
continued
for
six
months
and
is
said
to
have
been
carried
on
at
an
expense
equal
to
that
which
the
superb
military
hospital
the
hôtel
des
invalides
cost
its
founder
louis
xiv
but
republican
vengeance
did
not
waste
itself
exclusively
upon
senseless
lime
and
stone
it
sought
out
sentient
victims
the
deserved
death
of
châlier
had
been
atoned
by
an
apotheosis
executed
after
lyons
had
surrendered
but
collot
declared
that
every
drop
of
that
patriotic
blood
fell
as
if
scalding
his
own
heart
and
that
the
murder
demanded
atonement
all
ordinary
process
and
every
usual
mode
of
execution
was
thought
too
tardy
to
avenge
the
death
of
a
jacobin
proconsul
the
judges
of
the
revolutionary
commission
were
worn
out
with
fatigue
the
arm
of
the
executioner
was
weary
the
very
steel
of
the
guillotine
was
blunted
collot
devised
a
more
summary
mode
of
slaughter
a
number
of
from
two
to
three
hundred
victims
at
once
were
dragged
from
prison
to
the
place
de
brotteaux
one
of
the
largest
squares
in
lyons
and
there
subjected
to
a
fire
of
efficacious
as
this
mode
of
execution
may
seem
it
was
neither
speedy
nor
merciful
the
sufferers
fell
to
the
ground
like
singed
flies
mutilated
but
not
slain
and
imploring
their
executioners
to
despatch
them
speedily
this
was
done
with
sabres
and
bayonets
and
with
such
haste
and
zeal
that
some
of
the
jailors
and
assistants
were
slain
along
with
those
whom
they
had
assisted
in
dragging
to
death
and
the
mistake
was
not
discerned
until
upon
counting
the
dead
bodies
the
military
murderers
found
them
amount
to
more
than
the
destined
tale
the
bodies
of
the
dead
were
thrown
into
the
rhone
to
carry
news
of
the
republican
vengeance
as
collot
expressed
himself
to
toulon
then
also
in
a
state
of
revolt
but
the
sullen
stream
rejected
the
office
imposed
on
it
and
heaved
back
the
dead
in
heaps
upon
the
banks
and
the
committee
of
representatives
were
compelled
at
length
to
allow
the
relics
of
their
cruelty
to
be
interred
to
prevent
the
risk
of
contagion
the
people
of
the
south
of
france
have
always
been
distinguished
by
the
vivacity
of
their
temperament
as
cruelties
beget
retaliation
it
may
be
as
well
here
mentioned
that
upon
the
fall
of
the
jacobins
the
people
of
lyons
forgot
not
what
indeed
was
calculated
for
eternal
remembrance
and
took
by
violence
a
severe
and
sanguinary
vengeance
on
those
who
had
been
accessary
to
the
atrocities
of
couthon
and
collot
they
rose
on
the
jacobins
after
the
fall
of
robespierre
and
put
to
death
several
of
them
toulon
important
by
its
port
its
arsenals
and
as
well
as
by
its
fortifications
both
on
the
sea
and
land
side
had
partaken
deeply
in
the
feelings
which
pervaded
marseilles
bourdeaux
and
lyons
but
the
insurgents
of
toulon
were
determinedly
royalist
the
place
had
been
for
some
time
subjected
to
the
administration
of
a
jacobin
club
and
had
seen
the
usual
quantity
of
murders
and
excesses
with
the
greater
pain
that
the
town
contained
many
naval
officers
and
others
who
had
served
under
the
king
and
retained
their
affection
for
the
royal
cause
their
dissatisfaction
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
men
to
whom
every
sullen
look
was
cause
of
suspicion
and
the
slightest
cause
of
suspicion
a
ground
of
death
the
town
being
threatened
with
a
complete
purification
after
the
jacobin
fashion
the
inhabitants
resolved
to
anticipate
the
blow
at
the
dead
of
night
the
tocsin
was
sounded
by
the
citizens
who
dispersed
the
jacobin
club
seized
on
the
two
representatives
who
had
governed
its
proceedings
arrested
seven
or
eight
jacobins
who
had
been
most
active
in
the
previous
assassinations
and
in
spite
of
some
opposition
actually
executed

with
more
decision

the

made
to
collect
from
the
different

powers
such
a
supply
of
troops
as
could
be

into
the
place
but
the
event
of
the
siege
of
toulon
brings
our
general
historical
sketch
into
connexion
with
the
life
of
that
wonderful
person
whose
actions
we
have
undertaken
to
record
it
was
during
this
siege
that
the
light
was
first
distinguished
which
broadening
more
and
more
and
blazing
brighter
and
brighter
was
at
length
to
fill
with
its
lustre
the
whole
hemisphere
of

was
then
to
set
with
a
rapidity
equal
to
that
with
which
it
had
arisen
ere
however
we
produce
this
actor

male
pitt
himself
was
of
opinion
that
the
fury
of
the
french
revolution
would
wear
itself
out
and
that
it
already
presented
so
few
of
the
advantages
and
privileges
of
social
compact
that
it
seemed
as
if
its
political
elements
must
either
altogether
dissolve
or
assume
a
new
form
more
similar
to
that
on
which
all
other
states
and
governments
rest
their
stability
it
was
on
this
account
that
this
great
english
statesman
declined
assisting
in
plain
and
open
terms
the
royal
cause
and
desired
to
keep
england
free
from
any
pledge
concerning
the
future
state
of
government
in
france
aware
of
the
danger
of
involving
her
in
any
declared
and
avowed
interference
with
the
right
of
a
people
to
choose
their
own
system
however
anxious
to
prevent
the
revolutionary
opinions
as
well
as
arms
from
extending
beyond
their
own
frontier
it
was
thought
in
the
british
cabinet
by
one
large
party
that
the
present
frantic
excess
of
republican
principles
must
of
itself
produce
a
reaction
in
favour
of
more
moderate
sentiments
some
steady
system
for
the
protection
of
life
and
property
was
it
was
said
essential
to
the
very
existence
of
society
the
french
nation
must
assume
such
and
renounce
the
prosecution
of
those
revolutionary
doctrines
for
the
sake
of
their
own
as
well
as
of
other
countries
the
arrangement
must
it
was
thought
take
place
from
the
inevitable
course
of
human
affairs
which
however
they
may
fluctuate
are
uniformly
determined
at
length
by
the
interest
of
the
parties
concerned
such
was
the
principle
assumed
by
many
great
statesmen
whose
sagacity
was
unhappily
baffled
by
the
event
in
fact
it
was
calculating
upon
the
actions
and
personal
exertions
of
a
raving
madman
as
if
he
had
been
under
the
regulation
of
his
senses
and
acting
upon
principles
of
and
france
continued
not
only
to
subsist
but
to
be
victorious
without
a
government
unless
the
revolutionary
committees
and
jacobin
clubs
could
be
accounted
such
for
the
convention
was
sunk
into
a
mere
engine
of
that
party
and
sanctioned
whatever
they
proposed
without
religion
which
as
we
shall
see
they
formally
abolished
without
municipal
laws
or
rights
except
that
any
one
of
the
ruling
party
might
do
what
mischief
he
would
while
citizens
less
distinguished
for
patriotism
were
subjected
for
any
cause
or
no
cause
to
loss
of
liberty
property
and
life
itself
without
military
discipline
for
officers
might
be
dragged
from
their
regiments
and
generals
from
their
armies

the
information
of
their
own
soldiers

for
the
depression
of
the

extreme
without

there
were
no
ordinary
tribunals

appeal

or
commerce
without
fine
arts
any
more
than
those
which
were
useful
in

france
continued
to
subsist
and
to
achieve
victories
although
apparently
forsaken
of
god
and
deprived
of
all
the
ordinary
resources
of
human
wisdom
the
whole
system
of
society
indeed
seemed
only
to
retain
some
appearances

notwithstanding
the
deplorable
state
of

the

was
not

occasionally
but
permanently
and
triumphantly
victorious
she
was
like
the
champion
in

was
so
delicately
sliced
asunder
by
one
of
the
paladins
that
he
went
on

slew

warriors
without
discovering
for
a

that

was
the
only
logic
used
by

death
was
the
only
appeal
from
their
authority
the
guillotine
the
all
sufficing
argument
which
settled
each
debate
betwixt
them
and
the
governed
was
the
exchequer
low
the
guillotine
filled
it
with
the
effects
of
the
wealthy
who
were
judged
aristocratical
in
exact
proportion
to
the
extent
of
their
property
were
these
supplies
insufficient
diminished
as
they
were
by
peculation
ere
they
reached
the
public
coffers
the
assignats
remained

might
be
multiplied
to
any
quantity
did
the
paper
medium
of
circulation
fall
in
the
market
to
fifty
under

the
guillotine
was
ready
to
punish
those
who
refused
to
exchange
it
at
par
a
few
examples
of
such
jobbers
in
the
public
funds
made
men
glad
to
give
one
hundred
franks
for
state
money
which
they
knew
to
be
worth
no
more
than
fifty
was
bread
awanting
corn
was
to
be
found
by
the
same
compendious
means
and
distributed
among
the
parisians
as
among
the
ancient
citizens
of
rome
at
a
regulated
price
the
guillotine
was
a
key
to
storehouses
barns
and
granaries
did
the
army
want
recruits
the
guillotine
was
ready
to
exterminate
all
conscripts
who
should
hesitate
to
march
on
the
generals
of
the
republican
army
this
decisive
argument
which
might
have
been
deemed
less
applicable
in
all
its
rigour
to
them
than
to
others
was
possessed
of
the
most
exclusive
authority
they
were
beheaded
for
want
of
success
which
may
seem
less
different
from
the
common
course
of
affairs
but
they
were
also
guillotined
when
their
successes
were
not
improved
to
the
full
expectations
of
their
masters
nay
they
were
guillotined
when
being
too
successful
they
were
suspected
of
having
acquired
over
the
soldiers
who
had
conquered
under
them
an
interest
dangerous
to
those
who
had
the
command
of
this
reason
of
state
even
mere
mediocrity
and
a
limited
but
regular
discharge
of
duty
neither
so
brilliant
as
to
incur
jealousy
nor
so
important
as
to
draw
down
censure
was
no
protection
there
was
no
rallying
point
against
this
universal
and
very
simple
system
of
main
force
the
vendéans
who
tried
the
open
and
manly
mode
of
generous
and
direct
resistance
were
as
we
have
seen
finally
destroyed
leaving
a
name
which
will
live
for
ages
the
commercial
towns
which
upon
a
scale
more
modified
also
tried
their
strength
with
the
revolutionary
torrent
were
successively
overpowered
one
can
therefore
be
no
more
surprised
that
the
rest
of
the
nation
gave
way
to
predominant
force
than
we
are
daily
at
seeing
a
herd
of
strong
and
cattle
driven
to
the
shambles
before
one
or
two
butchers
and
as
many
as
the
victims
approach
the
and
smell
the
blood
of
those
which
have
suffered
the
fate
to
which
they
are
destined
they
may
be
often
observed
to
hesitate
start
roar
and
bellow
and
intimate
their
dread
of
the
fatal
spot
and
instinctive
desire
to
escape
from
it
but
the
cudgels
of
their
drivers
and
the
fangs
of
the
mastiffs
seldom
fail
to
compel
them
forward
slavering
and
snorting
and
trembling
to
the
destiny
which
awaits
them
the
power
of
exercising
this
tremendous
authority
over
a
terrified
nation
was
vested
in
few
hands
and
rested
on
a
very
simple
basis
the
convention
had
after
the
fall
of
the
girondists
remained
an
empty
show
of
what
it
had
once
some
title
to
call
itself
the
representative
body
of
the
french
nation
the
members
belonging
to
the
plain
who
had
observed
a
timid
neutrality
betwixt
the
mountain
and
the
girondists
if
not
without
talent
were
without
courage
to
make
any
opposition
to
the
former
when
triumphant
they
crouched
to
their
fate
were
glad
to
escape
in
silence
and
to
yield
full
passage
to
the
revolutionary
torrent
they
consoled
themselves
with
the
usual
apology
of
weak
minds
that
they
submitted
to
what
they
could
not
prevent
and
their
adversaries
while
despising
them
were
yet
tolerant
of
their
presence
and
somewhat
indulgent
to
their
scruples
because
while
these
timid
neutrals
remained
in
their
ranks
they
furnished
to
the
eye
at
least
the
appearance
of
a
full
senate
filled
the
ranks
of
the
representative
body
as
a
garment
is
stuffed
out
to
the
required
size
by
buckram
and
countenanced
by
their
passive
acquiescence
the
measures
which
they
most
detested
in
their
hearts
it
was
worth
the
while
of
the
mountain
to
endure
the
imbecility
of
such
associates
and
even
to
permit
occasionally
some
diffident
opposition
on
their
part
had
it
only
been
to
preserve
appearances
and
afford
a
show
of
a
free
assembly
debating
on
the
affairs
of
the
nation
thus
although
the
name
of
the
national
convention
was
generally
used
its
deputies
carefully
selected
from
the
jacobin
or
ruling
party
were
every
where
acting
in
their
name
with
all
the
authority
of
roman
proconsuls
while
of
the
body
sate
with
submitted
necks
and
padlocked
lips
unresisting
slaves
to
the
minor
proportion
which
again
under
its
various
fierce
leaders
was
beginning
to
wage
a
civil
war
within
its
own
limited
circle
but
the
young
reader
to
whom
this
eventful
history
is
a
novelty
may
ask
in
what
hands
was
the
real
power
of
the
government
lodged
of
which
the
convention
considered
as
a
body
was
thus
effectually
deprived
though
permitted
to
retain
like
the
apparition
in
macbeth
upon
its
baby
brow
the
round
and
type
of
sovereignty
france
had
indeed
in
accepted
with
the
usual
solemnities
a
new
constitution
which
was
stated
to
rest
on
the
right
republican
basis
and
was
of
course
alleged
to
afford
the
most
perfect
and
absolute
security
for
liberty
and
equality
that
the
nation
could
desire
but
this
constitution
was
entirely
superseded
in
practice
by
the
more
compendious
mode
of
governing
by
means
of
a
junto
selected
out
of
the
convention
itself
without
observing
any
farther
ceremony
in
fact
two
small
committees
vested
with
the
full
authority
of
the
state
exercised
the
powers
of
a
dictatorship
while
the
representatives
of
the
people
like
the
senate
under
the
roman
empire
retained
the
form
and
semblance
of
supreme
sway
might
keep
their
curule
chairs
and
enjoy
the
dignity
of
fasces
and
lictors
but
had
in
their
possession
and
exercise
scarcely
the
independent
powers
of
an
english
vestry
or
the
committee
of
public
safety
dictated
every
measure
of
the
convention
or
more
frequently
acted
without
deigning
to
consult
the
legislative
body
at
all
the
number
of
members
who
exercised
this
executive
government
fluctuated
betwixt
ten
and
twelve
and
as
they
were
all
chosen
jacobins
and
selected
as
men
capable
of
going
all
the
lengths
of
their
party
care
was
taken
by
from
time
to
time
to
render
the
situation
permanent
this
body
deliberated
in
secret
and
had
the
despotic
right
of
interfering
with
and
controlling
every
other
authority
in
the
state
and
before
its
absolute
powers
and
the
uses
which
were
made
of
them
the
council
of
ten
of
the
venetian
government
sunk
into
a
harmless
and
liberal
institution
another
committee
with
powers
of
the
same
revolutionary
nature
and
in
which
the
members
were
also
renewed
from
time
to
time
was
that
of
public
security
it
was
inferior
in
importance
to
that
of
public
safety
but
was
nevertheless
as
active
within
its
sphere
we
regret
to
record
of
a
man
of
genius
that
david
the
celebrated
painter
held
a
seat
in
the
committee
of
public
security
the
fine
arts
which
he
studied
had
not
produced
on
his
mind
the
softening
and
humanizing
effect
ascribed
to
them
frightfully
ugly
in
his
exterior
his
mind
seemed
to
correspond
with
the
harshness
of
his
looks
let
us
grind
enough
of
the
red
was
the
professional
phrase
of
which
he
made
use
when
sitting
down
to
the
bloody
work
of
the
day
that
these
revolutionary
committees
might
have
in
their
hands
a
power
subject
to
no
legal
defence
or
evasion
on
the
part
of
the
accused
merlin
of
douay
a
lawyer
it
is
said
of
eminence
framed
what
was
termed
the
law
against
suspected
persons
which
was
worded
with
so
much
ingenuity
that
not
only
it
enveloped
every
one
who
by
birth
friendship
habits
of
life
dependencies
or
other
ties
was
linked
however
distantly
with
aristocracy
whether
of
birth
or
property
but
also
all
who
had
in
the
various
changes
and
phases
of
the
revolution
taken
one
step
too
few
in
the
career
of
the
most
violent
patriotism
or
had
though
it
were
but
for
one
misguided
and
doubtful
moment
held
opinions
short
of
the
most
extravagant
jacobinism
this
crime
of
suspicion
was
of
the
nature
of
the
cameleon
it
derived
its
peculiar
shade
or
colour
from
the
person
to
whom
it
attached
for
the
moment
to
have
been
a
priest
or
even
an
assertor
of
the
rights
and
doctrines
of
christianity
was
fatal
but
in
some
instances
an
overflow
of
atheistical
blasphemy
was
equally
so
to
be
silent
on
public
affairs
betrayed
a
culpable
indifference
but
it
incurred
darker
suspicion
to
speak
of
them
otherwise
than
in
the
most
violent
tone
of
the
ruling
party
by
a
supplementary
law
this
spider
web
was
so
widely
extended
that
it
appeared
no
fly
could
be
found
insignificant
enough
to
escape
its
meshes
its
general
propositions
were
of
a
nature
so
vague
that
it
was
impossible
they
could
ever
be
made
subjects
of
evidence
therefore
they
were
assumed
without
proof
and
at
length
definition
of
the
characteristics
of
suspicion
seems
to
have
been
altogether
dispensed
with
and
all
those
were
suspected
persons
whom
the
revolutionary
committees
and
their
assistants
chose
to
hold
as
such
the
operation
of
this
law
was
terrible
a
suspected
person
besides
being
thrown
into
prison
was
deprived
of
all
his
rights
his
effects
sealed
up
his
property
placed
under
care
of
the
state
and
he
himself
considered
as
civilly
dead
if
the
unfortunate
object
of
suspicion
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
set
at
liberty
it
was
no
security
whatever
against
his
being
again
arrested
on
the
day
following
there
was
indeed
no
end
to
the
various
shades
of
sophistry
which
brought
almost
every
kind
of
person
under
this
oppressive
law
so
ample
was
its
scope
and
undefined
its
objects
that
the
administrators
of
this
law
of
suspicion
might
not
have
too
much
trouble
in
seeking
for
victims
all
householders
were
obliged
to
publish
on
the
outside
of
their
doors
a
list
of
the
names
and
description
of
their
inmates
domestic
security
the
most
precious
of
all
rights
to
a
people
who
know
what
freedom
really
is
was
violated
on
every
occasion
even
the
slightest
by
domiciliary
visits
the
number
of
arrests
which
took
place
through
france
choked
the
prisons
anew
which
had
been
so
fearfully
emptied
on
the
and
of
september
and
is
said
to
have
been
only
moderately
computed
at
three
hundred
thousand
souls
of
whom
were
women
the
jacobins
however
found
a
mode
of
less
summary
than
by
direct
massacre
although
differing
so
little
from
it
in
every
other
respect
that
a
victim
might
have
had
pretty
nearly
the
same
chance
of
a
fair
trial
before
maillard
and
his
men
of
september
as
from
the
revolutionary
tribunal
it
requires
an
effort
even
to
write
that
word
from
the
extremities
of
guilt
and
horror
which
it
recalls
but
it
is
the
lot
of
humanity
to
record
its
own
greatest
disgraces
and
it
is
a
wholesome
and
humbling
lesson
to
exhibit
a
just
picture
of
those
excesses
of
which
in
its
unassisted
movements
and
when
agitated
by
evil
and
misguided
passions
human
nature
can
be
rendered
capable
sidenote
revolutionary
tribunal
the
extraordinary
criminal
court
better
known
by
the
name
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
was
first
instituted
upon
the
motion
of
danton
its
object
was
to
judge
of
state
crimes
plots
and
attempts
against
liberty
or
in
favour
of
royalty
or
affecting
the
rights
and
liberty
of
man
or
in
any
way
more
or
less
tending
to
counteract
the
progress
of
the
revolution
in
short
it
was
the
business
of
this
court
to
execute
the
laws
or
inflict
the
sentence
rather
upon
such
as
had
been
arrested
as
suspected
persons
and
they
generally
saw
room
to
punish
in
most
of
the
instances
where
the
arresting
functionaries
had
seen
ground
for
imprisonment
this
frightful
court
consisted
of
six
judges
or
public
accusers
and
two
assistants
there
were
twelve
jurymen
but
the
appointment
of
these
was
a
mere
mockery
they
were
official
persons
who
held
permanent
appointments
had
a
salary
from
the
state
and
were
in
no
manner
liable
to
the
choice
or
challenge
of
the
party
tried
jurors
and
judges
were
selected
for
their
republican
zeal
and
steady
qualities
and
were
capable
of
seeing
no
obstacle
either
of
law
or
humanity
in
the
path
of
their
duty
this
tribunal
had
the
power
of
deciding
without
proof
or
cutting
short
evidence
when
in
the
progress
of
being
adduced
or
stopping
the
defence
of
the
prisoners
at
pleasure
privileges
which
tended
greatly
to
shorten
the
forms
of
court
and
aid
the
despatch
of
business
the
revolutionary
tribunal
was
in
a
short
time
so
overwhelmed
with
work
that
it
became
necessary
to
divide
it
into
four
sections
all
armed
with
similar
powers
the
quantity
of
blood
which
it
caused
to
be
shed
was
something
unheard
of
even
during
the
proscriptions
of
the
roman
empire
and
there
were
involved
in
its
sentences
crimes
the
most
different
personages
the
most
opposed
and
opinions
the
most
dissimilar
when
henry
viii
roused
the
fires
of
smithfield
both
against
protestant
and
papist
burning
at
the
same
stake
one
wretch
for
denying
the
supremacy
and
another
for
disbelieving
the
divine
presence
in
the
eucharist
the
association
was
consistency
itself
compared
to
the
scenes
presented
at
the
revolutionary
tribunal
in
which
royalist
constitutionalist
girondist
churchman
theophilanthropist
noble
and
roturier
prince
and
peasant
both
sexes
and
all
ages
were
involved
in
one
general
massacre
and
sent
to
execution
by
scores
together
and
on
the
same
sledge
supporting
by
their
numerous
associations
the
government
as
exercised
by
the
revolutionary
committees
came
the
mass
of
jacobins
who
divided
into
a
thousand
clubs
emanating
from
that
which
had
its
meetings
at
paris
formed
the
strength
of
the
party
to
which
they
gave
the
name
the
sole
principle
of
the
jacobinical
institutions
was
to
excite
against
all
persons
who
had
any
thing
to
lose
the
passions
of
those
who
possessed
no
property
and
were
by
birth
and
circumstances
brutally
ignorant
and
envious
of
the
advantages
enjoyed
by
the
higher
classes
all
other
governments
have
made
individual
property
the
object
of
countenance
and
protection
but
in
this
strangely
inverted
state
of
things
it
seemed
the
object
of
constant
suspicion
and
persecution
and
exposed
the
owner
to
perpetual
danger
we
have
elsewhere
said
that
equality
unless
in
the
no
less
intelligible
than
sacred
sense
of
equal
submission
to
the
law
is
a
mere
chimera
which
can
no
more
exist
with
respect
to
property
than
in
regard
to
mental
qualifications
or
personal
strength
beauty
or
stature
divide
the
whole
property
of
a
country
equally
among
its
inhabitants
and
a
week
will
bring
back
the
inequality
which
you
have
endeavoured
to
remove
nay
a
much
shorter
space
will
find
the
industrious
and
saving
richer
than
the
idle
and
prodigal
but
in
france
at
the
period
under
discussion
this
equality
in
itself
so
unattainable
had
completely
superseded
even
the
principle
of
liberty
as
a
for
exciting
the
people
it
was
to
sin
against
this
leading
principle
to
be
possessed
of
and
more
especially
to
enjoy
ostentatiously
any
thing
which
was
wanting
to
your
neighbour
to
be
richer
more
accomplished
better
bred
or
better
taught
subjected
you
to
the
law
of
suspicion
and
you
were
conducted
instantly
before
a
revolutionary
committee
where
you
were
probably
convicted
of
incivism
not
for
interfering
with
the
liberty
and
property
of
others
but
for
making
what
use
you
pleased
of
your
own
the
whole
of
the
terrible
mystery
is
included
in
two
regulations
communicated
by
the
jacobin
club
of
paris
to
the
committee
of
public
that
when
by
the
machinations
of
opulent
persons
seditions
should
arise
in
any
district
it
should
be
declared
in
a
state
of
that
the
convention
shall
avail
themselves
of
such
opportunity
excite
the
poor
to
make
war
on
the
and
to
restore
order
at
any
price
this
was
so
much
understood
that
one
of
the
persons
tried
by
the
revolutionary
tribunal
when
asked
what
he
had
to
say
in
his
defence
answered
i
am
wealthy
what
avails
it
to
me
to
offer
any
exculpation
when
such
is
my
offence
sidenote
affiliated
societies
the
committees
of
government
distributed
large
sums
of
money
to
the
jacobin
club
and
its
affiliated
societies
as
being
necessary
to
the
propagation
of
sound
political
principles
the
clubs
themselves
took
upon
them
in
every
village
the
exercise
of
the
powers
of
government
and
while
they
sat
swearing
drinking
and
smoking
examined
passports
imprisoned
citizens
and
enforced
to
their
full
extent
the
benefits
of
liberty
and
equality
death
or
fraternity
was
usually
inscribed
over
their
place
of
assembly
which
some
one
translated
become
my
brother
or
i
will
kill
thee
these
clubs
were
composed
of
members
drawn
from
the
lees
of
the
people
that
they
might
not
in
their
own
persons
give
an
example
contradicting
the
equality
which
it
was
their
business
to
enforce
they
were
filled
with
men
without
resources
or
talents
but
towards
whom
the
confidence
of
the
deceived
people
was
directed
from
the
conviction
that
because
taken
from
among
themselves
they
would
have
the
interest
of
the
lower
orders
constantly
in
view
their
secretaries
however
were
generally
selected
with
some
attention
to
alertness
of
capacity
for
on
them
depended
the
terrible
combination
which
extended
from
the
mother
society
of
jacobins
in
paris
down
into
the
most
remote
villages
of
the
most
distant
provinces
in
which
the
same
tyranny
was
maintained
by
the
influence
of
similar
means
thus
rumours
could
be
either
circulated
or
collected
with
a
speed
and
uniformity
which
enabled
a
whisper
from
robespierre
to
regulate
the
sentiments
of
the
jacobins
at
the
most
distant
part
of
his
empire
for
his
it
unquestionably
was
for
the
space
of
two
dreadful
years
france
had
been
subjected
to
many
evils
ere
circumstances
had
for
a
time
reduced
her
to
this
state
of
passive
obedience
to
a
yoke
which
after
all
when
its
strength
was
fairly
tried
proved
as
brittle
as
it
was
intolerable
those
who
witnessed
the
tragedies
which
then
occurred
look
back
upon
that
period
as
the
delirium
of
a
national
fever
filled
with
visions
too
horrible
and
painful
for
recollection
and
which
being
once
wiped
from
the
mind
we
recall
with
difficulty
and
reluctance
and
dwell
upon
with
disgust
a
long
course
of
events
tending
each
successively
to
disorganize
society
more
and
more
had
unhappily
prevented
a
brave
generous
and
accomplished
people
from
combining
together
in
mutual
defence
the
emigration
and
forfeiture
of
the
nobles
and
clergy
had
deprived
the
country
at
once
of
those
higher
classes
that
file
who
are
bred
up
to
hold
their
lives
light
if
called
on
to
lay
them
down
for
religion
or
in
defence
of
the
rights
of
their
country
or
the
principles
of
their
own
honour
or
conscience
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
wisdom
or
necessity
of
emigration
its
evils
were
the
same
a
and
generous
race
of
gentry
accustomed
to
consider
themselves
as
peculiar
depositaries
of
the
national
honour
a
learned
and
numerous
priesthood
the
guardians
of
religious
opinion
had
been
removed
from
their
place
and
society
was
so
much
the
more
weak
and
more
ignorant
for
the
want
of
them
whether
voluntarily
abandoning
or
forcibly
driven
from
the
country
the
expulsion
of
so
large
a
mass
belonging
entirely
to
the
higher
orders
tended
instantly
to
destroy
the
balance
of
society
and
to
throw
all
power
into
the
hands
of
the
lower
class
who
deceived
by
bad
and
artful
men
abused
it
to
the
frightful
excess
we
have
described
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
emigrants
had
carried
with
them
beyond
the
frontiers
all
the
worth
and
courage
of
the
better
classes
in
france
or
that
there
were
not
among
men
attached
to
the
cause
of
liberty
many
who
would
have
shed
their
blood
to
have
prevented
its
abuse
but
these
had
been
unhappily
during
the
progress
of
the
revolution
divided
and
subdivided
among
themselves
were
split
up
into
a
variety
of
broken
and
demolished
parties
which
had
repeatedly
suffered
proscription
and
what
was
worse
sustained
it
from
the
hand
of
each
other
the
constitutionalist
could
not
safely
join
in
league
with
the
royalist
or
either
with
the
girondist
and
thus
there
existed
no
confidence
on
which
a
union
could
be
effected
among
materials
repulsive
of
each
other
there
extended
besides
through
france
far
and
near
that
sorrow
and
sinking
of
the
heart
which
prevails
amid
great
national
calamities
where
there
is
little
hope
the
state
of
oppression
was
so
universal
that
no
one
strove
to
remedy
its
evils
more
than
they
would
have
struggled
to
remedy
the
of
an
infected
country
those
who
escaped
the
disorder
contented
themselves
with
their
individual
safety
without
thinking
of
the
general
evil
as
one
which
human
art
could
remedy
or
human
courage
resist
moreover
the
jacobinical
rulers
had
surrounded
themselves
with
such
a
system
of
espionage
and
delation
that
the
attempt
to
organize
any
resistance
to
their
power
would
have
been
in
fact
to
fall
inevitably
and
fatally
under
their
tyranny
if
the
bold
conspirator
against
this
most
infernal
authority
did
not
bestow
his
confidence
on
a
false
friend
or
a
concealed
emissary
of
the
jacobin
party
he
was
scarce
the
safer
on
that
account
for
if
he
breathed
forth
in
the
most
friendly
ear
any
thing
tending
to
reflect
on
the
free
happy
and
humane
government
under
which
he
had
the
happiness
to
live
his
hearer
was
bound
equally
as
a
hired
spy
to
carry
the
purport
of
the
conversation
to
the
constituted
authorities
that
is
to
the
revolutionary
committees
or
republican
commissioners
and
above
all
to
the
committee
of
public
safety
silence
on
public
affairs
and
acquiescence
in
democratic
tyranny
became
therefore
matter
of
little
wonder
for
men
will
be
long
mute
when
to
indulge
the
tongue
may
endanger
the
head
and
thus
in
the
kingdom
which
boasts
herself
most
civilized
in
europe
and
with
all
that
ardour
for
liberty
which
seemed
but
of
late
to
animate
every
bosom
the
general
apathy
of
terror
and
astonishment
joined
to
a
want
of
all
power
of
combination
palsied
every
effort
at
resistance
they
who
make
national
reflections
on
the
french
for
remaining
passive
under
circumstances
so
hopeless
should
first
reflect
that
our
disposition
to
prevent
or
punish
crime
and
our
supposed
readiness
to
resist
oppression
have
their
foundation
in
a
strong
confidence
in
the
laws
and
in
the
immediate
support
which
they
are
sure
to
receive
from
the
numerous
classes
who
have
been
trained
up
to
respect
them
as
protectors
of
the
rich
equally
and
of
the
poor
but
in
france
the
whole
system
of
the
administration
of
justice
was
in
the
hands
of
brutal
force
and
it
is
one
thing
to
join
in
the
hue
and
cry
against
a
murderer
seconded
by
the
willing
assistance
of
a
whole
population
another
to
venture
upon
withstanding
him
in
his
den
he
at
the
head
of
his
banditti
the
assailant
defenceless
excepting
in
the
justice
of
his
cause
sidenote
ferocity
of
the
populace
it
has
further
been
a
natural
subject
of
wonder
not
only
that
the
richer
and
better
classes
the
avowed
objects
of
jacobin
persecution
were
so
passively
resigned
to
this
frightful
tyranny
but
also
why
the
french
populace
whose
general
manners
are
so
civilized
and
so
kindly
that
they
are
on
ordinary
occasions
the
gayest
and
best
humoured
people
in
europe
should
have
so
far
changed
their
character
as
to
delight
in
cruelty
or
at
least
to
look
on
without
expressing
disgust
at
cruelties
perpetrated
in
their
name
but
the
state
of
a
people
in
ordinary
times
and
peaceful
occupations
is
in
every
country
totally
different
from
the
character
which
they
manifest
under
strong
circumstances
of
excitation
rousseau
says
that
no
one
who
sees
the
ordinary
greyhound
the
most
sportive
gentle
and
timid
perhaps
of
the
canine
race
can
form
an
idea
of
the
same
animal
pursuing
and
strangling
its
screaming
and
helpless
victim
something
of
this
sort
must
plead
the
apology
of
the
french
people
in
the
early
excesses
of
the
revolution
and
we
must
remember
that
men
collected
in
crowds
and
influenced
with
a
sense
of
wrongs
whether
real
or
imaginary
are
acted
upon
by
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
and
are
besides
in
a
state
of
such
general
and
undistinguishing
fury
that
they
adopt
by
joining
in
the
clamours
and
general
shouts
deeds
of
which
they
hardly
witness
the
import
and
which
perhaps
not
one
of
the
assembled
multitude
out
of
a
thousand
would
countenance
were
that
import
distinctly
felt
and
known
in
the
revolutionary
massacres
and
cruelties
there
was
always
an
executive
power
consisting
of
a
few
and
ruffians
whose
hands
perpetrated
the
actions
to
which
the
ignorant
vulgar
only
lent
their
acclamations
this
species
of
assentation
became
less
wonderful
when
instant
slaughter
without
even
the
ceremony
of
inquiry
had
been
exchanged
for
some
forms
however
flimsy
and
unsubstantial
of
regular
trial
condemnation
and
execution
these
served
for
a
time
to
satisfy
the
public
mind
the
populace
saw
men
dragged
to
the
guillotine
convicted
of
criminal
attempts
as
they
were
informed
against
the
liberty
of
the
people
and
they
shouted
as
at
the
punishment
of
their
own
immediate
enemies
but
as
the
work
of
death
proceeded
daily
the
people
became
softened
as
their
passions
abated
and
the
frequency
of
such
sacrifices
having
removed
the
odious
interest
which
for
a
while
attended
them
the
lower
classes
whom
robespierre
desired
most
to
conciliate
looked
on
first
with
indifference
but
afterwards
with
shame
and
disgust
and
at
last
with
the
wish
to
put
an
end
to
cruelties
which
even
the
most
ignorant
and
prejudiced
began
to
regard
in
their
own
true
undisguised
light
yet
the
operation
of
these
universal
feelings
was
long
delayed
to
support
the
reign
of
terror
the
revolutionary
committees
had
their
own
guards
and
executioners
without
whom
they
could
not
have
long
withstood
the
general
abhorrence
of
mankind
all
official
situations
were
scrupulously
and
religiously
filled
up
by
individuals
chosen
from
the
who
had
rendered
themselves
by
their
zeal
worthy
of
that
honourable
appellation
were
they
of
little
note
they
were
employed
in
the
various
capacities
of
guards
officers
and
jailors
for
which
the
times
created
an
unwearied
demand
did
they
hold
places
in
the
convention
they
were
frequently
despatched
upon
commissions
to
different
parts
of
france
to
give
new
edge
to
the
guillotine
and
superintend
in
person
the
punishment
of
conspiracy
or
rebellion
real
or
supposed
such
commissioners
or
proconsuls
as
they
were
frequently
termed
being
vested
with
unlimited
power
and
fresh
in
its
exercise
signalized
themselves
by
their
cruelty
even
more
than
the
tyrants
whose
will
they
discharged
we
may
quote
in
illustration
a
remarkable
passage
in
an
address
by
the
commissioners
of
public
safety
to
the
representatives
absent
upon
commissions
in
which
there
occur
some
gentle
remarks
on
their
having
extended
capital
punishment
to
cases
where
it
was
not
provided
by
law
although
the
lustre
of
their
services
to
the
republic
far
outshone
the
shade
of
such
occasional
peccadiloes
for
their
future
direction
they
are
thus
exhorted
let
your
energy
awaken
anew
as
the
term
of
your
labour
approaches
the
convention
charges
you
to
complete
the
purification
and
reorganization
of
the
constituted
authorities
with
the
least
possible
delay
and
to
report
the
conclusion
of
these
two
operations
before
the
end
of
the
next
month
a
simple
measure
may
effect
the
desired
purification
the
people
in
the
popular
societies
let
the
public
functionaries
appear
before
them
interrogate
the
people
on
the
subject
of
their
conduct
and
let
their
judgment
dictate
thus
the
wildest
prejudices
arising
in
the
jacobin
club
consisting
of
the
lowest
most
ignorant
most
prejudiced
and
often
most
malicious
members
in
society
were
received
as
evidence
and
the
populace
declared
masters
at
their
own
pleasure
of
the
property
honour
and
life
of
those
who
had
held
any
brief
authority
over
them
where
there
had
occurred
any
positive
rising
or
resistance
the
duty
of
the
commissioners
was
extended
by
all
the
powers
that
martial
law
in
other
words
the
rule
of
superior
force
could
confer
we
have
mentioned
the
murders
committed
at
lyons
but
even
these
though
hundreds
were
swept
away
by
volleys
of
fell
short
of
the
horrors
perpetrated
by
carrier
at
nantes
who
in
avenging
the
republic
on
the
obstinate
resistance
of
la
vendée
might
have
summoned
hell
to
match
his
cruelty
without
a
demon
venturing
to
answer
his
challenge
hundreds
men
women
and
children
were
forced
on
board
of
vessels
which
were
scuttled
and
sunk
in
the
loire
and
this
was
called
republican
baptism
men
and
women
were
stripped
bound
together
and
thus
thrown
into
the
river
and
this
was
called
republican
marriage
but
we
have
said
enough
to
show
that
men
blood
seems
to
have
been
converted
into
poison
and
their
hearts
into
stone
by
the
practices
in
which
they
were
daily
engaged
many
affected
even
a
lust
of
cruelty
and
the
instrument
of
punishment
was
talked
of
with
the
fondness
and
gaiety
with
which
we
speak
of
a
beloved
and
fondled
object
it
had
its
pet
name
of
the
little
national
window
and
others
equally
expressive
and
although

were
not
much
in
fashion
was
in
some
degree
canonized
by
the
name
of
the
holy
mother
guillotine
that
active
citizen
the
executioner
had
also
his
honours
as
well
as
the
senseless
machine
which
he
directed
this
official
was
admitted
to
the
society
of
some
of
the
more
emphatic
patriots
and
as
we
shall
afterwards
see
shared
in
their
civic
festivities
it
may
be
questioned
whether
even
company
was
not
too
good
for
the
patrons
who
thus
regaled
him
sidenote
revolutionary
army
there
was
also
an
armed
force
raised
among
the
most
and
hardened
satellites
of
the
lower
order
termed
by
the
revolutionary
army
they
were
under
the
command
of
ronsin
a
general
every
way
worthy
of
such
soldiers
these
troops
were
produced
on
all
occasions
when
it
was
necessary
to
intimidate
the
metropolis
and
the
national
guard
they
were
at
the
more
immediate
disposal
of
the
commune
of
paris
and
were
a
ready
though
not
a
great
force
which
always
could
be
produced
at
a
moment

and
were
generally
joined
by
the
more
active
democrats
in
the
capacity
of
a
jacobin
militia
in
their
own
ranks
they
mustered
six
thousand
men
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
some
of
the
persons
whose
agency
was
distinguished
during
this
disgraceful
period
and
whose
hands
were
deeply
dyed
in
the
blood
so
unrelentingly
shed
under
whatever
frenzy
of
brain
or
state
of
a
generally
maddening
impulse
they
may
have
acted
nevertheless
made
amends
in
their
after
conduct
for
their
enormities
then
committed
this
was
the
case
with
tallien
with
barras
with
fouché
legendre
and
others
who
neither
good
nor
scrupulous
men
were
yet
upon
many
subsequent
occasions
much
more
humane
and
moderate
than
could
have
been
expected
from
their
early
acquaintance
with
revolutionary
horrors
they
resembled
disbanded
soldiers
who
returned
to
their
native
homes
often
resume
so
entirely
the
habits
of
earlier
life
that
they
seem
to
have
forgotten
the
wild
and
perhaps
sanguinary
character
of
their
military
career
we
can
not
indeed
pay
any
of
these
reformed
jacobins
the
compliment
ascribed
to
octavius
by
the
romans
who
found
a
blessing
in
the
emperor
benevolent
government
which
compensated
the
injuries
inflicted
by
the
triumvir
but
it
is
certain
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
courage
of
tallien
and
barras
in
particular
it
might
have
been
much
longer
ere
the
french
had
been
able
to
rid
themselves
of
robespierre
and
that
the
revolution
of
thermidor
as
they
called
the
memorable
day
of
his
fall
was
in
a
great
measure
brought
about
by
the
remorse
or
jealousy
of
the
dictator
old
comrades
but
ere
we
arrive
at
that
more
auspicious
point
of
our
story
we
have
to
consider
the
train
of
causes
which
led
to
the
downfall
of
jacobinism
periods
which
display
great
national
failings
or
vices
are
those
also
which
bring
to
light

and
redeeming
virtues

during
the
years
and
exhibited
instances
of
extreme
cruelty
in
principle
and
practice
which
make
the
human
blood
curdle
she
may
also
be
censured
for
a
certain
abasement
of
spirit
for
sinking
so
long
unresistingly
under
a
yoke
so
unnaturally
horrible
but
she
has
to
boast
that
during
this
fearful
period
she
can
produce
as
many
instances
of
the
most
high
and
honourable
fidelity
of
the
most
courageous
and
devoted
humanity

rigour

to
death
at

affording

to
the

of

faction
and
the
interdiction
of

to

of
whatever
description
was
enforced
with
the
heaviest
penalty
yet
not
only
among
the
better
classes
but
among
the
poorest
of
the
poor
were
there
men
of
noble
minds
found
who
having
but
half
a
morsel
to
support
their
own
family
divided
it
willingly
with
some
wretched
fugitive
though
death
stood
ready
to
reward
their
charity

some
cases

and
devotion

esteemed

temptation
were
found
many
distinguished
instances
of
unshaken
fidelity
indeed
it
must
be
said
to
the
honour
of
the
french
manners
that
the
master
and
his
servant
live
on
a
footing
of
much
more
kindliness
than
attends
the
same
relation
in
other
countries
and
especially
in
britain
even
in
the
most
trying
situations
there
were
not
many
instances
of
domestic
treason

many
a

his
life

the
attachment
and

this
must
have
flowed
from

from
unmingled
veneration

a
venerable
french
ecclesiastic
being
on

visit
at
a
gentleman
house
in
north
britain
it
was
remarked
by
the
family
that
a
favourite
cat
rather
wild
and
capricious
in
its
habits
paid
particular
attention
to
their
guest
it
was
explained
by
the
priest
giving
an
account
of
his
lurking
in
the
waste
garret
or
of
an
artisan
house
for
several
weeks
in
this
condition
he
had
no
better
amusement
than
to
study
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
cats
which
frequented
his
place
of
retreat
and
acquire
the
mode
of
conciliating
their
favour
the
difficulty
of
supplying
him
with
food
without
attracting
suspicion
was
extreme
and
it
could
only
be
placed
near
his
place
of
concealment
in
small
quantities
and
at
uncertain
times
men
women
and
children
knew
of
his
being
in
that
place
there
were
rewards
to
be
gained
by
discovery
life
to
be
lost
by
persevering
in
concealing
him
yet
he
was
faithfully
preserved
to
try
upon
a
scottish
cat
after
the

of

monarchy

public
during
the
earlier
stages
of

still
his
ascendency
especially
in
the
club

was
formidable
enough
to
command

constant
attention

keep
awake
his

commune
of
paris
this
third
party
consisted
of
those
who
had
possessed
themselves
of
official
situations
in
the
commune
of
paris
whose
civic
authority
and
the
implement
which
they
commanded
in
the
revolutionary
army
commanded
by
ronsin
gave
them
the
power
of
marching
at
a
moment
warning
upon
the
convention
or
even
against
the
jacobin
club
it
is
true
these
men
of
whom
hébert
chaumette
and
others
were
leaders
had
never
shown
the
least
diffidence
of
robespierre
but
on
the
contrary
had
used
all
means
to
propitiate
his
favour
but
the
man
whom
a
tyrant
fears
becomes
with
little
farther
provocation
the
object
of
his
mortal
enmity
robespierre
watched
therefore
with
vigilance
the
occasion
of
overreaching
and
destroying
this
party
whose
power
he
dreaded
and
singular
to
tell
he
sought
the
means
of
accomplishing
their
ruin
in
the
very
extravagance
of
their
revolutionary
zeal
which
shortly
before
he
might
have
envied
as
pushed
farther
than
his
own
but
robespierre
did
not
want
sense
and
he
saw
with
pleasure
hébert
chaumette
and
their
followers
run
into
such
inordinate
extravagances
as
he
thought
might
render
his
own
interference
desirable
even
to
those
who
most
disliked
his
principles
most
abhorred
the
paths
by
which
he
had
climbed
to
power
and
most
feared
the
use
which
he
made
of
it
it
was
through
the
subject
of
religion
that
this
means
of
ruining
his
opponents
as
he
hoped
arose
a
subject
which
one
would
have
thought
so
indifferent
to
either
came
to
be
on
both
sides
the
occasion
of
quarrel
between
the
commune
of
paris
and
the
jacobin
leader
but
there
is
a
fanaticism
of
atheism
as
well
as
of
superstitious
belief
and
a
philosopher
can
harbour
and
express
as
much
malice
against
those
who
persevere
in
believing
what
he
is
pleased
to
denounce
as
unworthy
of
credence
as
an
ignorant
and
bigoted
priest
can
bear
against
a
man
who
can
not
yield
faith
to
dogmata
which
he
thinks
insufficiently
proved
accordingly
the
throne
being
wholly
annihilated
it
appeared
to
the
philosophers
of
the
school
of
hébert
that
in
totally
destroying
such
vestiges
of
religion
and
public
worship
as
were
still
retained
by
the
people
of
france
there
was
room
for
a
splendid
triumph
of
liberal
opinions
it
was
not
enough
they
said
for
a
regenerate
nation
to
have
dethroned
earthly
kings
unless
she
stretched
out
the
arm
of
defiance
towards
those
powers
which
superstition
had
represented
as
reigning
over
boundless
space
an
unhappy
man
named
gobel
constitutional
bishop
of
paris
was
brought
forward
to
play
the
principal
part
in
the
most
impudent
and
scandalous
farce
ever
acted
in
the
face
of
a
national
representation
it
is
said
that
the
leaders
of
the
scene
had
some
difficulty
in
inducing
the
bishop
to
comply
with
the
task
assigned
him
which
after
all
he
executed
not
without
present
tears
and
subsequent
remorse
but
he
did
play
the
part
prescribed
he
was
brought
forward
in
full
procession
to
declare
to
the
convention
that
the
religion
which
he
had
taught
so
many
years
was
in
every
respect
a
piece
of
priestcraft
which
had
no
foundation
either
in
history
or
sacred
truth
he
disowned
in
solemn
and
explicit
terms
the
existence
of
the
deity
to
whose
worship
he
had
been
consecrated
and
devoted
himself
in
future
to
the
homage
of
liberty
equality
virtue
and
morality
he
then
laid
on
the
table
his
episcopal
decorations
and
received
a
fraternal
embrace
from
the
president
of
the
convention
several
apostate
priests
followed
the
example
of
this
prelate
the
gold
and
silver
plate
of
the
churches
was
seized
upon
and
desecrated
processions
entered
the
convention
travestied
in
priestly
garments
and
singing
the
most
profane
hymns
while
many
of
the
chalices
and
sacred
vessels
were
applied
by
chaumette
and
hébert
to
the
celebration
of
their
own
impious
orgies
the
world
for
the
first
time
heard
an
assembly
of
men
born
and
educated
in
civilisation
and
assuming
the
right
to
govern
one
of
the
finest
of
the
european
nations
uplift
their
united
voice
to
deny
the
most
solemn
truth
which
man
soul
receives
and
renounce
unanimously
the
belief
and
worship
of
a
deity
for
a
short
time
the
same
mad
profanity
continued
to
be
acted
upon
sidenote
goddess
of
reason
one
of
the
ceremonies
of
this
insane
time
stands
unrivalled
for
absurdity
combined
with
impiety
the
doors
of
the
convention
were
thrown
open
to
a
band
of
musicians
preceded
by
whom
the
members
of
the
municipal
body
entered
in
solemn
procession
singing
a
hymn
in
praise
of
liberty
and
escorting
as
the
object
of
their
future
worship
a
veiled
female
whom
they
termed
the
goddess
of
reason
being
brought
within
the
bar
she
was
unveiled
with
great
form
and
placed
on
the
right
hand
of
the
president
when
she
was
generally
recognised
as
a
of
the
opera
with
whose
charms
most
of
the
persons
present
were
acquainted
from
her
appearance
on
the
stage
while
the
experience
of
individuals
was
farther
extended
to
this
person
as
the
fittest
representative
of
that
reason
whom
they
worshipped
the
national
convention
of
france
rendered
public
homage
this
impious
and
ridiculous
mummery
had
a
certain
fashion
and
the
installation
of
the
goddess
of
reason
was
renewed
and
imitated
throughout
the
nation
in
such
places
where
the
inhabitants
desired
to
show
themselves
equal
to
all
the
heights
of
the
revolution
the
churches
were
in
most
districts
of
france
closed
against
priests
and
worshippers
the
bells
were
broken
and
cast
into
cannon
the
whole
ecclesiastical
establishment
destroyed
and
the
republican
inscription
over
the
cemeteries
declaring
death
to
be
perpetual
sleep
announced
to

who
lived
under

dominion
that
they
were

hope
no
redress
even
in
the
next
world
intimately
connected
with
these
laws
affecting

was
that
which
reduced
the
union
of
marriage
the
most
sacred
engagement
which
human
beings
can
form
and
the
permanence
of
which
leads
most
strongly
to
the
consolidation
of
society
to
the
state
of
a
mere
civil
contract
of
a
transitory
character
which
any
two
persons
might
engage
in
and
cast
loose
at
pleasure
when
their
taste
was
changed
or
their
appetite
gratified
if
fiends
had
set
themselves
to
work
to
discover
a
mode
of
most
effectually
destroying
whatever
is
venerable
graceful
or
permanent
in
domestic
life
and
of
obtaining
at
the
same
time
an
assurance
that
the
mischief
which
it
was
their
object
to
create
should
be
perpetuated
from
one
generation
to
another
they
could
not
have
invented
a
more
effectual
plan
than
the
degradation
of
marriage
into
a
state
of
mere
occasional
cohabitation
or
licensed
concubinage
sophie
arnould
an
actress
famous
for
the
witty
things
she
said
described
the
republican
marriage
as
the
sacrament
of
adultery
these
and
regulations
did
not
answer
the
purpose
of
the
frantic
and
inconsiderate
zealots
by
whom
they
had
been
urged
forward
hébert
and
chaumette
had
outrun
the
spirit
of
the
time
evil
as
that
was
and
had
contrived
to
get
beyond
the
sympathy
even
of
those
who
at
heart
as
vicious
and
criminal
as
they
had
still
the
sagacity
to
fear
or
the
taste
to
be
disgusted
with
this
overstrained
tone
of
outrageous
impiety
perhaps
they
might
have
other
motives
for
condemning
so
gross
a
display
of
irreligion
the
most
guilty
of
men
are
not
desirous
generally
speaking
totally
to
disbelieve
and
abandon
all
doctrines
of
religious
faith
they
can
not
if
they
would
prevent
themselves
from
apprehending
a
future
state
of
retribution
and
little
effect
as
such
feeble
glimmering
of
belief
may
have
on
their
lives
they
will
not
in
general
willingly
throw
away
the
slight
chance
that
it
may
be
possible
on
some
occasion
to
reconcile
themselves
to
the
church
or
to
the
deity
this
hope
even
to
those
on
whom
it
has
no
salutary
influence
resembles
the
confidence
given
to
a
sailor
during
a
gale
of
wind
by
his
knowing
that
there
is
a
port
under
his
lee
his
purpose
may
be
never
to
run
for
the
haven
or
he
may
judge
there
is
great
improbability
that
by
doing
so
he
should
reach
it
in
safety
yet
still
such
being
the
case
he
would
esteem
himself
but
little
indebted
to
any
one
who
should
blot
the
harbour
of
refuge
out
of
the
chart
to
all
those
who
in
various
degrees
received
and
believed
the
great
truths
of
religion
on
which
those
of
morality
are
dependent
the
professors
of
those
wild
absurdities
became
objects
of
contempt
dislike

and

danton
regarded
the
proceedings
of
hébert
and
his
philosophers
of
the
commune
with
scorn
and
disgust
however
wicked
he
had
shown
himself
he
was
too
wise
and
too
proud
to
approve
of
such
impolitic
and
senseless
folly
besides
this
perpetual
undermining
whatever
remained
of
social
institutions
prevented
any
stop
being
put
to
the
revolutionary
movements
which
danton
having
placed
his
party
at
the
head
of
affairs
and
himself
nearly
as
high
as
he
could
promise
to
climb
was
now
desirous
should
be
done
sidenote
robespierre
robespierre
looked
on
these
extravagant
proceedings
with
a
different
and
more
watchful
eye
he
saw
what
hébert
and
his
associates
had
lost
in
popularity
by
affecting
the
doctrines
of
atheism
and
utter
profaneness
and
he
imagined
a
plan
first
for
destroying
these
blasphemers
by
the
general
consent
of
the
nation
as
noxious
animals
and
then
of
enlarging
and
as
it
were
sanctifying
his
own
power
by
once
more
connecting
a
spirit
of
devotion
of
some
modified
kind
or
other
with
the
revolutionary
form
of
government
of
which
he
desired
to
continue
the
head
it
has
even
been
supposed
that
robespierre
extravagant
success
in
rising
so
much
above
all
human
expectation
had
induced
him
to
entertain
some
thoughts
of
acting
the
part
of
a
new
mahomet
in
bringing
back
religious
opinion
into
france
under
his
own
direct
auspices
he
is
said
to
have
countenanced
in
secret
the
extravagances
of
a
female
called
catherine
theos
or
theost
an
enthusiastic
devotee
whose
doctrines
leaned
to
quietism
she
was
a
kind
of
joanna
southcote
and
the
aaron
of
her
sect
was
dom
gerle
formerly
a
carthusian
monk
and
remarkable
for
the
motion
he
made
in
the
first
national
assembly
that
the
catholic
religion
should
be
recognised
as
that
of
france
since
that
time
he
had
become
entirely
deranged
a
few
visionaries
of
both
sexes
attended
secret
and
nightly
meetings
in
which
theos
and
dom
gerle
presided
robespierre
was
recognised
by
them
as
one
of
the
elect
and
is
said
to
have
favoured
their
superstitious
doctrines
but
whether
the
dictator
saw
in
them
any
thing
more
than
tools
which
might
be
applied
to
his
own
purpose
there
seems
no
positive
authority
to
decide
at
any
rate
whatever
religious
opinions
he
might
have
imbibed
himself
or
have
become
desirous
of
infusing
into
the
state
they
were
not
such
as
were
qualified
to
modify
either
his
ambition
his
jealousy
or
his
love
of
blood
the
power
of
hébert
chaumette
and
of
the
commune
of
paris
was
now
ripe
for
destruction
ronsin
with
the
other
armed
satellites
of
the
revolutionary
army
bullied
indeed
and
spoke
about
taking
the
part
of
the
magistracy
of
paris
against
the
convention
but
though
they
had
the
master
and
active
ruffians
still
at
their
service
they
could
no
longer
command
the
long
sable
columns
of
pikes
which
used
to
follow
and
back
them
and
without
whose
aid
they
feared
they
might
not
be
found
equal
in
number
to
face
the
national
guard
so
early
as
december
we
find
chaumette
expressing
himself
to
the
commune
as
one
who
had
fallen
on
evil
times
and
evil
days
he
brought
forward
evidence
to
show
that
it
was
not
he
who
had
conducted
the
installation
of

of

in
his
native
city

of

it
was
plain
that
a
change
was
taking
place
in
the
political
atmosphere

chaumette
was
obliged
to
vindicate
himself
from
the
impiety
which
used
to
be
his
boast
and
was
subjected

to
female
reproach
for
his
republican
zeal
in
imprisoning
and
destroying

the

dissolved

danton

the
hébertists

removed
robespierre
had
yet
to
combat
and
defeat
a
more
formidable
adversary
the
late
conspirators
had
held
associations
with
the
club
of
cordeliers
with
which
danton
was
supposed
to
have
particular
relations
but
they
had
not
experienced
his
support
which
in
policy
he
ought
to
have
extended
to
them
he
had
begun
to
separate
his
party
and
his
views
too
distinctly
from
his
old
friends
and
old
proceedings
he
imagined
falsely
as
it
proved
that
his
bark
could
sail
as
triumphantly
upon
waves
composed
only
of
water
as
on
those
of
blood
he
and
others
seem
to
have
been
seized
with
a
loathing
against
these
continued
acts
of
cruelty
as
if
they
had
been
gorged
and
nauseated
by
the
constant
repetition
danton
spoke
of
mercy
and
pardon
and
his
partisan
camille
desmoulins
in
a
very
ingenious
parody
upon
tacitus
drew
a
comparison
between
the
tyrants
and
informers
of
the
french
jacobin
government
and
those
of
the
roman
imperial
court
the
parallels
were
most
ably
drawn
and
robespierre
and
his
agents
might
read
their
own
characters
in
those
of
the
most
odious
wretches
of
that
odious
time
from
these
aggressions
danton
seemed
to
meditate
the
part
which
tallien
afterwards
adopted
of
destroying
robespierre
and
his
power
and
substituting
a
mode
of
government
which
should
show
some
regard
at
least
to
life
and
to
property
but
he
was
too
late
in
making
his
movement
robespierre
was
beforehand
with
him
and
on
the
morning
of
the
of
march
the
parisians
and
the
members
of
the
convention
hardly
dared
whisper
to
each
other
that
danton
whose
name
had
been
as
formidable
as
the
sound
of
the
tocsin
had
been
arrested
like
any
poor
and
was
in
the
hands
of
the
fatal
lictors
there
was
no
end
of
exclamation
and
wonder
for
danton
was
the
great
apostle
the
very
mahomet
of
jacobinism
his
gigantic
stature
his
huge
and
ferocious
physiognomy
his
voice
which
struck
terror
in
its
notes
of
distant
thunder
and
the
energies
of
talent
and
vehemence
mingled
which
supplied
that
voice
with
language
worthy
of
its
deep
tones
were
such
as
became
the
prophet
of
that
horrible
and
fearful
sect
marat

a
madman
raised
into
consequence
only
by
circumstances
robespierre
a
cold
creeping
calculating
hypocrite
whose
malignity
resembled
that
of
a
paltry
and
fiend
but
danton
was
a
character
for
shakspeare
or
schiller
to
have
drawn
in
all
its
broad
lights
and
shades
or
bruce
could
have
sketched
from
him
a
yet
grander

he

his
passions
were
a
hurricane

furious

desolating

course
had
yet
its
intervals
of
sunshine
and
repose
neither
good
by
nature
nor
just
by
principle
or
political
calculation
men
were
often
surprised
at
finding
he
still
possessed
some
feelings
of
generosity
and
some
tendency
even
towards
magnanimity
early
habits
of
profligate
indulgence
the
most
complete
stifler
of
human
virtue
and
his
implication
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
with
the
wretched
faction
of
orleans
made
him
if
not
a
worse
certainly
a
meaner
villain
than
nature
had
designed
him
for
his
pride
must
have
saved
him
from
much
which
he
yielded
to
from
the
temptations
of
gross
indulgence
and
from
the
sense
of
narrow
circumstances
still
when
danton
fell
under
robespierre
it
seemed
as
if
the
had
hawked
at
and
struck
an
eagle
or
at
least
a
vulture
his
avowed
associates
lamented
him
of
course
nay

and
others
by
undertaking
his
defence
in
the
convention
and
arrogating
for
him
the
merit
of
those
violent
measures
which
had
paved
the
way
to
the
triumph
of
jacobinism
showed
more
consistency
in
their
friendship
than
these
ferocious
demagogues
manifested
on
any
other
occasion
danton
before
his
fall
seemed
to
have
lost
much
of
his
sagacity
as
well
as
energy
he
had
full
warning
of
his
danger
from
la
croix
westermann
and
others
yet
took
no
steps
either
for
escape
or
defence
though
either
seemed
in
his
power
still
his
courage
was
in
no
degree
abated
or
his
haughty
spirit
tamed
although
he
seemed
to
submit
passively
to
his
fate
with
the
disheartening
conviction
which
often
unmans
great
criminals
that
his
hour

before
the
revolutionary

singular
accomplishment
of
the
prophecy

girondist
boyer
fonfrède
this
man
had
exclaimed
to
danton
under
whose

established
you

it
not

danton
was
now
surrounded
by
those
who
had
been
too
humble
to
aspire
to
be
companions
of
his
atrocities
and
held
themselves
sufficiently
honoured
in
becoming

on

so
inconsistent

the
doom
ought
in
justice
to
have
involved

and
most
of
the
spectators
in
the
court
robespierre
became
much
alarmed
for
the
issue
of
the
trial
the
convention
showed
reviving
signs
of
spirit
and
when
a
revolutionary
deputation
demanded
at
the
bar
that
death
should
be
the
order
of
the
day
and
reminded
them
that
had
they
granted
the
moderate
demand
of
three
hundred
thousand
heads
when
requested
by
the
philanthropic
and
now
canonized
marat
they
would
have
saved
the
republic
the
wars
of

they
were
received
with
discouraging
murmurs
tallien
the
president
informed
them
that
not
death
but
justice
was
the
order
of
the
day
and
the
petitioners
notwithstanding
the
patriotic
turn
of
their
modest
request
were
driven
from
the
bar
with
execrations
sidenote
danton
executed
this
looked
ill
but
the
power
of
robespierre
was
still
predominant
with
the
revolutionary
tribunal
and
after
a
gallant
and
unusually
long
defence
of
which
no
notice
was
permitted
to
appear
in
the
moniteur
danton
and
his
associates
were
condemned
and
carried
to
instant
execution
they
maintained
their
firmness
or
rather
hardenedness
of
character
to
the
last
the
sufferers
on
this
occasion
were
men
whose
accomplishments
and
talents
attracted
a
higher
degree
of
sympathy
than
that
which
had
been
given
to
the
equally
eloquent
but
less
successful
girondists
even
honest
men
looked
on
the
fate
of
danton
with
some
regret
as
when
a
furious
bull
is
slain
with
a
slight
blow
by
a
crafty
tauridor
and
many
men
of
good
feelings
had
hoped
that
the
cause
of
order
and
security
might
at
least
have
been
benefited
in
some
degree
by
his
obtaining
the
victory
in
a
struggle
with
robespierre
those
on
the
other
hand
who
followed
the
fortunes
of
the
latter
conceived
his
power
had
been
rendered
permanent
by
the
overthrow
of
his
last
and
most
formidable
rival
and
exulted
in
proportion
both
were
deceived
in
their
calculations
the
predominance
of
such
a
man
as
danton
might
possibly
have
protracted
the
reign
of
jacobinism
even
by
rendering
it
somewhat
more
endurable
but
the
permanent
at
least
the
ultimate
success
of
robespierre
was
becoming
more
impossible
from
the
repeated
decimations
to
which
his
jealousy
subjected
his
party
he
was
like
the
wild
chief
lope
whose
story
is
so
well
told
by
southey
who
descending
the
great
river
orellana
with
a
party
of
bucaniers
cut
off
one
part
of
his
followers
after
another
in
doubt
of
their
fidelity
until
the
remainder
saw
no
chance
for
escaping
a
similar
fate
unless
by
being
beforehand
with
their
leader
in
murder
alluding
to
robespierre
having
been
the
instrument
of
his
destruction
danton
had
himself
exclaimed
the
cowardly
poltroon
i
am
the
only
person
who
could
have
commanded
influence
enough
to
save
him
and
the
event
showed
that
he
spoke
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
the
approach
of
fate
has
been
sometimes
thought
to
confer
in
fact
robespierre
was
much
isolated
by
the
destruction
of
the
party
of
hébert
and
still
more
by
that
of
danton
and
his
followers
he
had
so
to
speak
scarped
away
the
ground
which
he
occupied
until
he
had
scarce
left
himself
and
detested
by
honest
men
he
had
alienated
by
his
successive
cruelties
even
the
knaves
who
would
otherwise
have
adhered
to
him
for
their
own
safety
all
now
looked
on
him
with
fear
and
none
dared
hope
at
the
hands
of
the
dictator
a
better
boon
than
that
which
is
promised
to
outis
that
he
should
be
the
last
devoured
it
was
at
this
period
that
robespierre
conceived
the
idea
of
reversing
the
profanities
of
chaumette
hébert
and
the
atheists
by
professing
a
public
belief
in
the
existence
of
a
deity
this
he
conceived
would
at
once
be
a
sacrifice
to
public
opinion
and
as
he
hoped
to
manage
it
a
new
and
potent
spring
to
be
moved
by
his
own
finger
in
a
word
he
seems
to
have
designed
to
unite
with
his
power
in
the
state
the
character
of

pontiff
of
the
new
faith
as
the
organ
of
the
committee
of

safety
robespierre
may
by
a
speech
of
great
length
and
extremely
dull
undertook
the
conversion
of
the
french
nation
from
infidelity
upon
all
such
occasions
he
had
recourse
to
that
gross
flattery
which
was
his
great
and
almost
sole
receipt
for
popularity
he
began
by
assuring
them
that
in
her
lights
and
the
progress
of
her
improvement
france
had
preceded
the
rest
of
europe
by
a
mark
of
at
least
two
thousand
years
and
that
existing
among
the
ordinary
nations
of
the
world
she
appeared
to
belong
to
another
race
of
beings
still
he
thought
some
belief
in
a
deity
would
do
her
no
harm
then
he
was
again
hurried
away
by
his
eloquence
of
which
we
can
not
help
giving
a
literal
specimen
to
show
at
how
little
expense
of
sense
taste
or
talent
a
man
may
be
held
an
excellent
orator
and
become
dictator
of
a
great
nation
yes
the
delicious
land
which
we
inhabit
and
which
nature
caresses
with
so
much
predilection

made
to
be

domain
of
liberty
and
of
happiness

to

and
for

if

had
caused

i
would
not

have
addressed
constant
prayers
to

in

and
would
have

over
the

sidenote
festival
of
the
supreme
being
such
was
the
language
which
this
great
demagogue
held
to
the
sublime
people
whose
lives
he
disposed
of
at
the
rate
of
fifty
per
day
regular
and
who
were
so
well
protected
in
person
and

that
no
man
dared
call

or
answer
for
ten
minutes
space
for
the

of
the
head
that
wore
it
much
there
was
also
about
the
rashness
of
the
worshippers
of
reason
whose
steps
he
accuses
of
being
too
premature
in

cause
much
about
england
and
pitt
who
he
says
fasted
on
account
of
the
destruction
of
the
catholic
religion
in
france
as
they
wore
mourning
for
capet
and
his
wife
but
the
summary
of
this
extraordinary
oration
was
a
string
of
decrees
commencing
with
a
declaration
that
the
republic
of
france
acknowledged
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
in
the
precise
form
in
which
the
grand
nation
might
have
recognised
the
government
of
a
state
the
other
decrees
established
the
nature
of
the
worship
to
be
rendered
to
the
great
being
whom
these
frail
atoms
had
restored
to
his
place
in
their
thoughts
and
this
was
to
be
expressed
by
dedicating
a
day
in
each
decade
to
some
peculiar
and
established
virtue
with
hymns
and
processions
in
due
honour
of
it
approaching
as
near
to
paganism
as
could
well
be
accomplished
the
last
decree
appointed
a
to
be
given
in
honour
of
the
supreme
being
himself
as
the
nation
might
have
celebrated
by
public
rejoicings
a
pacification
with
some
neighbouring
power
the
speech
was
received
with
servile
applause
by
the
convention
couthon
with
affected
enthusiasm
demanded
that
not
only
the
speech
should
be
published
in
the
usual
form
by
supplying
each
member
with
six
copies
but
that
the
plan
should
be
translated
into
all
languages
and
dispersed
through
the
universe
the
conducting
of
this
heathen
mummery
which
was
substituted
for
every
external
sign
of
rational
devotion
was
intrusted
to
the
genius
of
the
painter
david
and
had
it
not
been
that
the
daring
blasphemy
of
the
purpose
threw
a
chill
upon
the
sense
of
ridicule
it
was
scarcely
matched
as
a
masquerade
even
by
the
memorable
procession
conducted
by
the
notorious
orator
of
the
human
race
there
was
a
general
muster
of
all
paris
june
divided
into
bands
of
young
women
and
matrons
and
old
men
and
youths
with
oaken
boughs
and
drawn
swords
and
all
other
emblems
appertaining
to
their
different
ages
they
were
preceded
by
the
representatives
of
the
people
having
their
hands
full
of
ears
of
corn
and
spices
and
fruits
while
robespierre
their
president
clad
in
a
sort
of
purple
garment
moved
apart
and
alone
and
played
the
part
of
sovereign
pontiff
after
marching
up
and
down
through
the
streets
to
the
sound
of
doggrel
hymns
the
procession
drew
up
in
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
before
some
fireworks
which
had
been
prepared
and
robespierre
made
a
speech
entirely
addressed
to
the
bystanders
without
a
word
either
of
prayer
or
invocation
his
acknowledgment
of
a
divinity
was
it
seems
limited
to
a
mere
admission
in
point
of
fact
and
involved
no
worship
of
the
great
being
whose
existence
he
at
length
condescended
to
own
he
had
no
sooner
made
his
offering
than
fire
was
set
to
some
figures
dressed
up
to
resemble
atheism
ambition
egotism
and
other
evil
principles
the
young
men
then
brandished
their
weapons
the
old
patted
them
on
the
head
the
girls
flung
about
their
flowers
and
the
matrons
flourished
aloft
their
children
all
as
it
had
been
set
down
in
david
programme
and
this
scene
of
masking
was
to
pass
for
the
repentance
of
a
great
people
turning
themselves
again
to
the
deity
whose
worship
they
had
forsaken
and
whose
being
they
had
denied
i
will
appeal
not
to
a
sincere
christian
but
to
any
philosopher
forming
such
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
deity
as
even
mere
unassisted
reason
can
attain
to
whether
there
does
not
appear
more
impiety
in
robespierre
mode
of
acknowledging
the
divinity
than
in
horrible
avowal
of
direct
atheism
the
procession
did
not
in
common
phrase
with
the
people
it
produced
no
striking
effect
awakened
no
deep
feeling
by
catholics
it
was
regarded
with
horror
by
wise
men
of
every
or
no
principle
as
ridiculous
and
there
were
politicians
who
under
the
disguise
of
this
religious
ceremony
pretended
to
detect
further
and
deeper
schemes
of
the
dictator
robespierre
even
in
the
course
of
the
procession
threats
and
murmurs
had
reached
his
ears
which
the
impatient
resentment
of
the
friends
of
danton
was
unable
to
suppress
and
he
saw
plainly
that
he
must
again
betake
himself
to
the
task
of
murder
and
dispose
of
tallien
collot
and
others
as
he
had
done
successively
of
hébert
and
danton
himself
or
else
his
former
victories
would
but
lead
to
his
final
ruin
meanwhile
the
despot
whose
looks
made
even
the
democrats
of
the
mountain
tremble
when
directed
upon
them
shrunk
himself
before
the
apprehended
presence
of
a
young
female
cécile
regnault
a
girl
and
as
it
would
seem
unarmed
came
to
his
house
and
demanded
to
see
robespierre
her
manner
exciting
some
suspicion
she
was
seized
upon
by
the
of
jacobins
who
day
and
night
watched
the
den
of
the
tyrant
amidst
riot
and
blasphemy
while
he
endeavoured
to
sleep
under
the
security
of
their
neighbourhood
when
the
young
woman
was
brought
before
the
revolutionary
tribunal
she
would
return
no
answer
to
the
questions
respecting
her
purpose
excepting
that
she
wished
to
see
what
a
tyrant
was
like
she
was
condemned
to
the
guillotine
of
course
and
about
sixty
persons
were
executed
as
associates
of
a
conspiracy
which
was
never
proved
by
deed
or
word
to
have
existed
at
all
the
victims

drawn
at
hazard
out
of
the
prisons

most
of
them
had
been
confined
for
months
previous
to

arrest
of
cécile

on
whose
account
they
were
represented
as
suffering
many
have
thought
the
crime
entirely
imaginary

by
robespierre
to
represent
his
person
as
endangered
by
the
plots
of
the
aristocracy

to
himself

up

shops
at
the
hours
when
the
fatal
tumbrils
passed
to
the
scene
of
death
and
that
whole
quarter
of
the
city
was
covered
with
gloom
these
ominous
feelings
were
observed
and
the
fatal
engine
was
removed
to
a
more
obscure
situation
at
the
barrièr
de
la
trône
near
the
fauxbourg
saint
antoine
to
the
inhabitants
of
which
it
was
thought
a
daily
spectacle
of
this
nature
must
be
an
interesting
relief
from
labour
but
even
the
people
of
that
turbulent
suburb
had
lost
some
of
their
republican
zeal
the
men
feelings
were
altered
they
saw
indeed
blood
stream
in
such
quantities
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
an
artificial
conduit
to
carry
it
off
but
they
did
not
feel
that
they
or
those
belonging
to
them
received
any
advantages
from
the
number
of
victims
daily
immolated
as
they
were
assured
in
their
behalf
the
constant
effusion
of
blood
without
plunder
or
license
to
give
it
zest
disgusted
them
as
it
would
have
disgusted
all
but
literal
cannibals
to
whose
sustenance
indeed
the
revolutionary
tribunal
would
have
contributed
plentifully
sidenote
robespierre
unpopular
robespierre
saw
all
this
increasing
unpopularity
with
much
anxiety
he
plainly
perceived
that
strong
as
its
impulse
was
the
stimulus
of
terror
began
to
lose
its
effect
on
the
popular
mind
and
he
resolved
to
give
it
novelty
not
by
changing
the
character
of
his
system
but
by
varying
the
mode
of
its
application
hitherto
men
had
only
been
executed
for
political
crimes
although
the
circle
had
been
so
vaguely
drawn
and
capable
of
such
extension
when
desired
that
the
law
regarding
suspected
persons
was
alone
capable
of
desolating
a
whole
country
but
if
the
penalty
of
death
were
to
be
inflicted
for
religious
and
moral
delinquencies
as
well
as
for
crimes
directed
against
the
state
it
would
at
once
throw
the
lives
of
thousands
at
his
disposal
upon
whom
he
could
have
no
ready
hold
on
political
motives
and
might
support
at
the
same
time
his
newly
assumed
character
as
a
reformer
of
manners
he
would
also
thus
escape
the
disagreeable
and
embarrassing
necessity
of
drawing
lines
of
distinction
betwixt
his
own
conduct
and
that
of
the
old
friends
whom
he
found
it
convenient
to
sacrifice
he
could
not
say
he
was
less
a
murderer
than
the
rest
of
his
associates
but
he
might
safely
plead
more
external
decency
of
morals
his
own
manners
had
always
been
reserved
and
austere
and
what
a
triumph
would
it
have
been
had
the
laws
permitted
him
the
benefit
of
slaying
danton
not
under
that
political
character
which
could
hardly
be
distinguished
from
his
own
but
on
account
of
the
gross
peculation
and
debauchery
which
none
could
impute
to
the
austere
and
incorruptible
robespierre
his
subordinate
agents
began
already
to
point
to
a
reformation
of
manners
payan
who
succeeded
hébert
in
the
important
station
of
procureur
to
the
commune
of
the
metropolis
had
already
adopted
a
very
different
line
from
his
predecessor
whose
style
derived
energy
by
printing
at
full
length
the
foulest
oaths
and
most
beastly
expressions
used
by
the
refuse
of
the
people
payan
on
the
contrary
in
direct
opposition
to
père
duchêsne
is
found
gravely
advising
with
the
commune
of
paris
on
a
plan
of
preventing
the
exposing
licentious
prints
and
works
to
sale
to
the
evident
danger
of
corrupting
the
rising
generation
there
exists
also
a
curious
address
from
the
convention
which
tends
to
evince
a
similar
purpose
in
the
framer
robespierre
the
guilt
of
profane
swearing
and
of
introducing
the
sacred
name
into
ordinary
speech
as
an
unmeaning
and
blasphemous
expletive
is
severely
censured
the
using
indecent
and
vicious
expressions
in
common
discourse
is
also
touched
upon
but
as
this
unbounded
energy
of
speech
had
been
so
very
lately
one
of
the
most
accredited
marks
of
a
true
the
legislators
were
compelled
to
qualify
their
censure
by
admitting
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
the
vulgar
mode
of
speaking
had
been
generally
adopted
by
patriots
in
order
to
destroy
the
jargon
employed
by
the
privileged
classes
and
to
as
it
was
expressed
the
general
language
of
society
but
these
ends
being
effected
the
speech
of
republicans
ought
it
is
said
to
be
simple
manly
and
concise
but
at
the
same
time
free
from
coarseness
and
violence
from
these
indications
and
the
tenor
of
a
decree
to
be
hereafter
quoted
it
seems
plain
that
robespierre
was
about
to
affect
a
new
character
not
perhaps
without
the
hope
of
finding
a
puritanic
party
in
france
as
favourable
to
his
ambitious
views
as
that
of
the
independents
was
to
cromwell
he
might
then
have
added
the
word
to
liberty
and
equality
which
formed
the
national
programme
and
doubtless
would
have
made
it
the
pretext
of
committing
additional
crimes
the
decree
which
we
allude
to
was
brought
forward
june
by
the
philanthropic
couthon
who
with
his
kindness
of
manner
rendered
more
impressive
by
a
voice
and
an
affectation
of
extreme
gentleness
tendered
a
law
extending
the
powers
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
and
the
penalty
of
death
not
only
to
all
sorts
of
persons
who
should
in
any
manner
of
way
neglect
their
duty
to
the
republic
or
assist
her
enemies
but
to
the
following
additional
classes
all
who
should
have
deceived
the
people
or
their
representatives
all
who
should
have
sought
to
inspire
discouragement
into
good
citizens
or
to
favour
the
undertakings
of
tyrants
all
who
should
spread
false
news
all
who
should
seek
to
lead
astray
the
public
opinion
and
to
prevent
the
instruction
of
the
people
or
to
debauch
manners
and
corrupt
the
public
conscience
or
who
should
diminish
the
purity
of
revolutionary
principles
by
works
it
is
evident
that
compared
with
a
law
couched
in
terms
so
vague
and
general
so
obscure
and
indefinite
the
description
of
crimes
concerning
suspected
persons
was
broad
sunshine
that
there
was
no
frenchman
living
who
might
not
be
brought
within
the
danger
of
the
decree
under
one
or
other
of
those
sweeping
clauses
that
a
loose
or
careless
expression
or
the
repetition
of
an
inaccurate
article
of
news
might
be
founded
on
as
corrupting
the
public
conscience
or
misleading
the
public
opinion
in
short
that
the
slightest
indulgence
in
the
most
ordinary
functions
of
speech
might
be
brought
under
this
comprehensive
edict
and
so
cost
the
speaker
his
life
the
decree
sounded
like
a
in
the
ears
of
the
convention
all
were
made
sensible
that
another
decimation
of
the
legislative
body
approached
and
beheld
with
terror
that
no
provision
was
made
in
the
proposed
law
for
respecting
the
personal
inviolability
of
the
deputies
but
that
the
obnoxious
members
of
the
convention
without
costing
robespierre
even
the
formality
of
asking
a
decree
from
their
complaisant
brethren
might
be
transferred
like
any
ordinary
individuals
to
the
butchery
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
not
only
by
the
medium
of
either
of
the
committees
but
at
the
instance
of
the
public
prosecutor
or
even
of
any
of
their
own
brethren
of
the
representative
body
who
were
acting
under
a
commission
ruamps
one
of
the
deputies
exclaimed
in
accents
of
despair
that
if
this
decree
were
resolved
upon
the
friends
of
liberty
had
no
other
course
left
than
to
blow
their
own
brains
out
the
law
passed
for
the
night
in
spite
of
all
opposition
but
the
terrified
deputies
returned
to
the
attack
next
day
the
measure
was
again
brought
into
debate
and
the
question
of
privileges
was
evasively
provided
for
at
a
third
sitting
the
theme
was
renewed
and
after
much
violence
the
fatal
decree
was
carried
without
any
of
the
clogs
which
had
offended
robespierre
and
he
attained
possession
of
the
fatal
weapon
such
as
he
had
originally
forged
it
from
this
moment
there
was
mortal
though
secret
war
betwixt
robespierre
and
the
most
distinguished
members
of
the
assembly
particularly
those
who
had
sate
with
him
on
the
celebrated
mountain
and
shared
all
the
atrocities
of
jacobinism
collot
the
demolisher
of
lyons
and
regenerator
of
ville
affranchie
threw
his
weight
into
the
scale
against
his
master
and
several
other
members
of
both
committees
which
were
robespierre
own
organs
began
secretly
to
think
on
means
of
screening
themselves
from
a
power
which
like
the
huge
anaconda
enveloped
in
its
coils
and
then
crushed
and
swallowed
whatever
came
in
contact
with
it
the
private
progress
of
the
schism
can
not
be
traced
but
it
is
said
that
the
dictator
found
himself
in
a
minority
in
the
committee
of
public
safety
when
he
demanded
the
head
of
fouché
whom
he
had
accused
as
a
dantonist
in
the
convention
and
the
jacobin
club
it
is
certain
he
had
not
attended
the
meeting
of
the
committee
for
two
or
three
weeks
before
his
fall
leaving
his
interest
there
to
be
managed
by
couthon
and
saint
just
feeling
himself
thus
placed
in
the
lists
against
his
ancient
friends
the
terrorists
the
astucious
tyrant
endeavoured
to
acquire
allies
among
the
remains
of
the
girondists
who
had
been
spared
in
contempt
more
than
clemency
and
permitted
to
hide
themselves
among
the
neutral
party
who
occupied
the
plain
and
who
gave
generally
their
votes
on
the
prudential
system
of
adhering
to
the
stronger
side
finding
little
countenance
from
this
timid
and
part
of
the
legislative
body
robespierre
returned
to
his
more
steady
supporters
in
the
jacobin
club
here
he
retained
his
supremacy
and
was
heard
with
enthusiastic
applause
while
he
intimated
to
them
the
defection
of
certain
members
of
the
legislature
from
the
true
revolutionary
course
complained
of
the
inactivity
and
lukewarmness
of
the
committees
of
public
safety
and
public
security
and
described
himself
as
a
persecuted
patriot
almost
the
solitary
supporter
of
the
cause
of
his
country
and
exposed
for
that
reason
to
the
blows
of
a
thousand
assassins
all
patriots
exclaimed
couthon
are
brothers
and
friends
for
my
part
i
invoke
on
myself
the
poniards
destined
against
robespierre
so
do
we
all
exclaimed
the
meeting
unanimously
thus
encouraged
robespierre
urged
a
purification
of
the
society
directing
his
accusations
against
fouché
and
other
members
of
the
mountain
and
he
received
the
encouragement
he
desired
he
next
ascertained
his
strength
among
the
judges
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
and
his
willing
agents
among
the
reformed
commune
of
paris
which
after
the
fall
of
hébert
and
chaumette
he
had
taken
care
to
occupy
with
his
most
devoted
friends
but
still
he
knew
that
in
the
storm
which
was
about
to
arise
these
demagogues
were
but
a
sort
of
tritons
of
the
minnows
compared
to
tallien
fouché
barras
collot
and
other
deputies
of
distinguished
powers
accustomed
to
make
their
voices
heard
and
obeyed
amid
all
the
roar
of
revolutionary
tempest
he
measured
and
remeasured
his
force
with
theirs
and
for
more
than
six
weeks
avoided
the
combat
yet
without
making
any
overtures
for
reconciliation
in
which
indeed
neither
party
would
probably
have
trusted
the
other
meantime
the
dictator
enemies
had
also
their
own
ground
on
which
they
could
engage
advantageously
in
these
skirmishes
which
were
to
serve
as
preludes
to
the
main
and
fatal
conflict
vadier
on
the
part
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
laid
before
the
convention
in
a
tone
of
bitter
satirical
ridicule
the
history
of
the
mystical
meetings
and
formation
of
a
religious
sect
under
catherine
theos
whose
pretensions
have
been
already
hinted
at
no
mention
was
indeed
made
of
robespierre
or
of
the
countenance
he
was
supposed
to
have
given
to
these
fanatical
intriguers
but
the
fact
of
his
having
done
so
was
well
known
and
the
shafts
of
vadier
were
aimed
with
such
malignant
dexterity
that
while
they
seemed
only
directed
against
the
mystics
of
whom
he
spoke
they
galled
to
the
quick
the
high
pontiff
who
had
so
lately
conducted
the
new
and
singular
system
of
worship
which
his
influence
had
been
employed
to
ingraft
upon
the
genuine
atheism
natural
to
jacobinism
robespierre
felt
he
could
not
remain
long
in
this
situation
that
there
were
no
means
of
securing
himself
where
he
stood
that
he
must
climb
higher
or
fall
and
that
every
moment
in
which
he
supported
insults
and
endured
menaces
without
making
his
vengeance
felt
brought
with
it
a
diminution
of
his
power
he
seems
to
have
hesitated
between
combat
and
flight
among
his
papers
according
to
the
report
of
cortois
who
examined
them
was
found
an
obscure
intimation
that
he
had
acquired
a
competent
property
and
entertained
thoughts
of
retiring
at
the
close
of
his
horrible
career
after
the
example
of
the
celebrated
sylla
it
was
a
letter
from
some
unknown
confidant
unsigned
and
undated
containing
the
following
singular
passage
you
must
employ
all
your
dexterity
to
escape
from
the
scene
on
which
you
are
now
once
more
to
appear
in
order
to
leave
it
for
ever
your
having
attained
the
president
chair
will
be
but
one
step
to
the
guillotine
through
a
rabble
who
will
spit
upon
you
as
you
pass
as
they
did
upon
egalité
since
you
have
collected
a
treasure
sufficient
to
maintain
you
for
a
long
time
as
well
as
those
for
whom
you
have
made
provision
i
will
expect
you
with
anxiety
that
we
may
enjoy
a
hearty
laugh
together
at
the
expense
of
a
nation
as
credulous
as
it
is
greedy
of
novelty
if
however
he
had
really
formed
such
a
plan
which
would
not
have
been
inconsistent
with
his
base
spirit
the
means
of
accomplishing
it
were
probably
never
perfected
at
length
his
fate
urged
him
on
to
the
encounter
robespierre
descended
july
to
the
convention
where
he
had
of
late
but
rarely
appeared
like
the
far
nobler
dictator
of
rome
and
in
his
case
also
a
band
of
senators
were
ready
to
poniard
the
tyrant
on
the
spot
had
they
not
been
afraid
of
the
popularity
he
was
supposed
to
enjoy
and
which
they
feared
might
render
them
instant
victims
to
the
revenge
of
the
jacobins
the
speech
which
robespierre
addressed
to
the
convention
was
as
menacing
as
the
first
distant
rustle
of
the
hurricane
and
dark
and
lurid
as
the
eclipse
which
announces
its
approach
anxious
murmurs
had
been
heard
among
the
populace
who
filled
the
tribunes
or
crowded
the
entrances
of
the
hall
of
the
convention
indicating
that
a
second
of
may
being
the
day
on
which
the
jacobins
proscribed
the
girondists
was
about
to
witness
a
similar
operation
the
first
theme
of
the
gloomy
orator
was
the
display
of
his
own
virtues
and
his
services
as
a
patriot
distinguishing
as
enemies
to
their
country
all
whose
opinions
were
contrary
to
his
own
he
then
reviewed
successively
the
various
departments
of
the
government
and
loaded
them
in
turn
with
censure
and
contempt
he
declaimed
against
the
supineness
of
the
committees
of
public
safety
and
public
security
as
if
the
guillotine
had
never
been
in
exercise
and
he
accused
the
committee
of
finance
of
having
the
revenues
of
the
republic
he
enlarged
with
no
less
bitterness
on
withdrawing
the
artillerymen
always
violent
jacobins
from
paris
and
on
the
mode
of
management
adopted
in
the
conquered
countries
of
belgium
it
seemed
as
if
he
wished
to
collect
within
the
same
lists
all
the
functionaries
of
the
state
and
in
the
same
breath
to
utter
defiance
to
them
all
sidenote
robespierre
denounced
the
usual
honorary
motion
was
made
to
print
the
discourse
but
then
the
storm
of
opposition
broke
forth
and
many
speakers
vociferously
demanded
that
before
so
far
adopting
the
grave
inculpations
which
it
contained
the
discourse
should
be
referred
to
the
two
committees
robespierre
in
his
turn
exclaimed
that
this
was
subjecting
his
speech
to
the
partial
criticism
and
revision
of
the
very
parties
whom
he
had
accused
exculpations
and
defences
were
heard
on
all
sides
against
the
charges
which
had
been
thus
sweepingly
brought
forward
and
there
were
many
deputies
who
complained
in
no
obscure
terms
of
individual
tyranny
and
of
a
conspiracy
on
foot
to
outlaw
and
murder
such
part
of
the
convention
as
might
be
disposed
to
offer
resistance
robespierre
was
but
feebly
supported
save
by
saint
just
couthon
and
by
his
own
brother
after
a
stormy
debate
in
which
the
convention
were
alternately
swayed
by
their
fear
and
their
hatred
of
robespierre
the
discourse
was
finally
referred
to
the
committees
instead
of
being
printed
and
the
haughty
and
sullen
dictator
saw
in
the
open
slight
thus
put
on
his
measures
and
opinions
the
sure
mark
of
his
approaching
fall
sidenote
robespierre
defence
he
carried
his
complaints
to
the
jacobin
club
to
repose
as
he
expressed
it
his
patriotic
sorrows
in
their
virtuous
bosoms
where
alone
he
hoped
to
find
succour
and
sympathy
to
this
partial
audience
he
renewed
in
a
tone
of
yet
greater
audacity
the
complaints
with
which
he
had
loaded
every
branch
of
the
government
and
the
representative
body
itself
he
reminded
those
around
him
of
various
heroic
eras
when
their
presence
and
their
pikes
had
decided
the
votes
of
the
trembling
deputies
he
reminded
them
of
their
pristine
actions
of
revolutionary
vigour
asked
them
if
they
had
forgot
the
road
to
the
convention
and
concluded
by
pathetically
assuring
them
that
if
they
forsook
him
he
stood
resigned
to
his
fate
and
they
should
behold
with
what
courage
he
would
drink
the
fatal
hemlock
the
artist
david
caught
him
by
the
hand
as
he
closed
exclaiming
in
rapture
at
his
elocution
i
will
drink
it
with
thee
the
distinguished
painter
has
been
reproached
as
having
on
the
subsequent
day
declined
the
pledge
which
he
seemed
so
eagerly
to
embrace
but
there
were
many
of
his
original
opinion
at
the
time
he
expressed
it
so
boldly
and
had
robespierre
possessed
either
military
talents
or
even
decided
courage
there
was
nothing
to
have
prevented
him
from
placing
himself
that
very
night
at
the
head
of
a
desperate
insurrection
of
the
jacobins
and
their
followers
payan
the
successor
of
hébert
actually
proposed
that
the
jacobins
should
instantly
march
against
the
two
committees
which
robespierre
charged
with
being
the
focus
of
the
machinations
surprise
their
handful
of
guards
and
stifle
the
evil
with
which
the
state
was
menaced
even
in
the
very
cradle
this
plan
was
deemed
too
hazardous
to
be
adopted
although
it
was
one
of
those
sudden
and
of
policy
which
machiavel
would
have
recommended
the
fire
of
the
jacobins
spent
itself
in
tumult
and
threatening
in
expelling
from
the
bosom
of
their
society
collot
tallien
and
about
thirty
other
deputies
of
the
mountain
party
whom
they
considered
as
specially
leagued
to
effect
the
downfall
of
robespierre
and
whom
they
drove
from
their
society
with
execrations
and
even
blows
collot
thus
outraged
went
straight
from
the
meeting
of
the
jacobins
to
the
place
where
the
committee
of
public
safety
was
still
sitting
in
consultation
on
the
report
which
they
had
to
make
to
the
convention
the
next
day
upon
the
speech
of
robespierre
saint
just
one
of
their
number
though
warmly
attached
to
the
dictator
had
been
intrusted
by
the
committee
with
the
delicate
task
of
drawing
up
that
report
it
was
a
step
towards
reconciliation
but
the
entrance
of
collot
frantic
with
the
insults
he
had
received
broke
off
all
hope
of
accommodation
betwixt
the
friends
of
danton
and
those
of
robespierre
exhausted
himself
in
threats
against
saint
just
couthon
and
their
master
robespierre
and
they
parted
on
terms
of
mortal
and
avowed
enmity
every
exertion
now
was
used
by
the
associated
conspirators
against
the
power
of
robespierre
to
collect
and
combine
against
him
the
whole
forces
of
the
convention
to
alarm
the
deputies
of
the
plain
with
fears
for
themselves
and
to
awaken
the
rage
of
the
mountaineers
against
whose
throat
the
dictator
now
waved
the
sword
which
their
shortsighted
policy
had
placed
in
his
hands
lists
of
proscribed
deputies
were
handed
around
said
to
have
been
copied
from
the
tablets
of
the
dictator
genuine
or
false
they
obtained
universal
credit
and
currency
and
those
whose
names
stood
on
the
fatal
scrolls
engaged
themselves
for
protection
in
the
league
against
their
enemy
the
opinion
that
his
fall
could
not
be
delayed
now
became
general
sidenote
the
ninth
thermidor
this
sentiment
was
so
commonly
entertained
in
paris
on
the
thermidor
or
july
that
a
herd
of
about
eighty
victims
who
were
in
the
act
of
being
dragged
to
the
guillotine
were
nearly
saved
by
means
of
it
the
people
in
a
generous
burst
of
compassion
began
to
gather
in
crowds
and
interrupted
the
melancholy
procession
as
if
the
power
which
presided
over
these
hideous
exhibitions
had
already
been
deprived
of
energy
but
the
hour
was
not
come
the
vile
henriot
commandant
of
the
national
guards
came
up
with
fresh
forces
and
on
the
day
destined
to
be
the
last
of
his
own
life
proved
the
means
of
carrying
to
execution
this
crowd
of
unhappy
and
doubtless
innocent
persons
on
this
eventful
day
robespierre
arrived
in
the
convention
and
beheld
the
mountain
in
close
array
and
completely
manned
while
as
in
the
case
of
cataline
the
bench
on
which
he
himself
was
accustomed
to
sit
seemed
purposely
deserted
saint
just
couthon
le
bas
his
and
the
younger
robespierre
were
the
only
deputies
of
name
who
stood
prepared
to
support
him
but
could
he
make
an
effectual
struggle
he
might
depend
upon
the
aid
of
the
servile
barrère
a
sort
of
belial
in
the
convention
the
meanest
yet
not
the
least
able
amongst
those
fallen
spirits
who
with
great
adroitness
and
ingenuity
as
well
as
wit
and
eloquence
caught
opportunities
as
they
arose
and
was
eminently
dexterous
in
being
always
strong
upon
the
strongest
and
safe
upon
the
safest
side
there
was
a
tolerably
numerous
party
ready
in
times
so
dangerous
to
attach
themselves
to
barrère
as
a
leader
who
professed
to
guide
them
to
safety
if
not
to
honour
and
it
was
the
existence
of
this
vacillating
and
uncertain
body
whose
ultimate
motions
could
never
be
calculated
upon
which
rendered
it
impossible
to
presage
with
assurance
the
event
of
any
debate
in
the
convention
during
this
dangerous
period
saint
just
arose
in
the
name
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
to
make
after
his
own
manner
not
theirs
a
report
on
the
discourse
of
robespierre
on
the
previous
evening
he
had
begun
an
harangue
in
the
tone
of
his
patron
declaring
that
were
the
tribune
which
he
occupied
the
tarpeian
rock
itself
he
would
not
the
less
placed
as
he
stood
there
discharge
the
duties
of
a
i
am
about
he
said
to
lift
the
veil
i
tear
it
asunder
said
tallien
interrupting
him
the
public
interest
is
sacrificed
by
individuals
who
come
hither
to
speak
exclusively
in
their
own
name
and
conduct
themselves
as
superior
to
the
whole
convention
he
forced
saint
just
from
the
tribune
and
a
violent
debate
ensued
sidenote
robespierre
denounced
called
the
attention
of
the
assembly
to
the
sitting
of
the
jacobin
club
on
the
preceding
evening
he
declared
the
military
force
of
paris
was
placed
under
the
command
of
henriot
a
traitor
and
a
parricide
who
was
ready
to
march
the
soldiers
whom
he
commanded
against
the
convention
he
denounced
robespierre
himself
as
a
second
cataline
artful
as
well
as
ambitious
whose
system
it
had
been
to
nurse
jealousies
and
inflame
dissensions
in
the
convention
so
as
to
disunite
parties
and
even
individuals
from
each
other
attack
them
in
detail
and
thus
destroy
those
antagonists
separately
upon
whose
combined
and
united
strength
he
dared
not
have
looked
the
convention
echoed
with
applause
every
violent
expression
of
the
orator
and
when
robespierre
sprung
to
the
tribune
his
voice
was
drowned
by
a
general
shout
of
down
with
the
tyrant
tallien
moved
the
denunciation
of
robespierre
with
the
arrest
of
henriot
his
and
of
others
connected
with
the
meditated
violence
on
the
convention
he
had
undertaken
to
lead
the
attack
upon
the
tyrant
he
said
and
to
poniard
him
in
the
convention
itself
if
the
members
did
not
show
courage
enough
to
enforce
the
law
against
him
with
these
words
he
brandished
an
unsheathed
poniard
as
if
about
to
make
his
purpose
good
robespierre
still
struggled
hard
to
obtain
audience
but
the
tribune
was
adjudged
to
barrère
and
the
part
taken
against
the
fallen
dictator
by
that
versatile
and
statesman
was
the
most
absolute
sign
that
his
overthrow
was
irrecoverable
torrents
of
invective
were
now
uttered
from
every
quarter
of
the
hall
against
him
whose
single
word
was
wont
to
hush
it
into
silence
the
scene
was
dreadful
yet
not
without
its
use
to
those
who
may
be
disposed
to
look
at
it
as
an
extraordinary
crisis
in
which
human
passions
were
brought
so
singularly
into
collision
while
the
vaults
of
the
hall
echoed
with
exclamations
from
those
who
had
hitherto
been
the
accomplices
the
flatterers
the
followers
at
least
the
timid
and
overawed
assentators
to
the
dethroned
demagogue
he
himself
breathless
foaming
exhausted
like
the
hunter
of
classical
antiquity
when
on
the
point
of
being
overpowered
and
torn
to
pieces
by
his
own
hounds
tried
in
vain
to
raise
those
notes
by
which
the
convention
had
formerly
been
terrified
and
put
to
silence
he
appealed
for
a
hearing
from
the
president
of
the
assembly
to
the
various
parties
of
which
it
was
composed
rejected
by
the
mountaineers
his
former
associates
who
now
headed
the
clamour
against
him
he
applied
to
the
girondists
few
and
feeble
as
they
were
and
to
the
more
numerous
but
equally
helpless
deputies
of
the
plain
with
whom
they
sheltered
the
former
shook
him
from
them
with
disgust
the
last
with
horror
it
was
in
vain
he
reminded
individuals
that
he
had
spared
their
lives
while
at
his
mercy
this
might
have
been
applied
to
every
member
in
the
house
to
every
man
in
france
for
who
was
it
during
two
years
that
had
lived
on
other
terms
than
under
robespierre
permission
and
deeply
must
he
internally
have
regretted
the
clemency
as
he
might
term
it
which
had
left
so
many
with
ungashed
throats
to
bay
at
him
but
his
agitated
and
repeated
appeals
were
repulsed
by
some
with
indignation
by
others
with
sullen
or
embarrassed
and
timid
silence
a
british
historian
must
say
that
even
robespierre
ought
to
have
been
heard
in
his
defence
and
that
such
calmness
would
have
done
honour
to
the
convention
and
dignified
their
final
sentence
of
condemnation
as
it
was
they
no
doubt
treated
the
guilty
individual
according
to
his
deserts
but
they
fell
short
of
that
regularity
and
manly
staidness
of
conduct
which
was
due
to
themselves
and
to
the
law
and
which
would
have
given
to
the
punishment
of
the
demagogue
the
effect
and
weight
of
a
solemn
and
deliberate
sentence
in
place
of
its
seeming
the
result
of
a
hasty
and
precipitate
seizure
of
a
temporary
advantage
haste
was
however
necessary
and
must
have
appeared
more
so
at
such
a
crisis
than
perhaps
it
really
was
much
must
be
pardoned
to
the
terrors
of
the
moment
the
horrid
character
of
the
culprit
and
the
necessity
of
hurrying
to
a
decisive
conclusion
we
have
been
told
that
his
last
audible
words
contending
against
the
exclamations
of
hundreds
and
the
bell
which
the
president
was
ringing
incessantly
and
uttered
in
the
highest
tones
which
despair
could
give
to
a
voice
naturally
shrill
and
discordant
dwelt
long
on
the
memory
and
haunted
the
dreams
of
many
who
heard
him
president
of
assassins
he
screamed
for
the
last
time
i
demand
privilege
of
speech
after
this
exertion
his
breath
became
short
and
faint
and
while
he
still
uttered
broken
murmurs
and
hoarse
ejaculations
a
member
of
the
mountain
called
out
that
the
blood
of
danton
choked
his
voice
the
tumult
was
closed
by
a
decree
of
arrest
against
robespierre
his
brother
couthon
and
saint
just
le
bas
was
included
on
his
own
motion
and
indeed
could
scarce
have
escaped
the
fate
of
his

his
conduct
then
and
subsequently
showed
more
energy
than
that
of
the
others
couthon
hugging
in
his
bosom
the
spaniel
upon
which
he
was
wont
to
exhaust
the
overflowing
of
his
affected
sensibility
appealed
to
his
decrepitude
and
asked
whether
maimed
of
proportion
and
activity
as
he
was
could
be
suspected
of
nourishing
plans
of
violence
or
wretch
said
legendre
thou
hast
the
strength
of
hercules
for
the
perpetration
of
crime
dumas
president
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
with
henriot
commandant
of
the
national
guards
and
other
satellites
of
robespierre
were
included
in
the
doom
of
arrest
the
officers
of
the
legislative
body
were
ordered
to
lay
hands
on
robespierre
but
such
was
the
terror
of
his
name
that
they
hesitated
for
some
time
to
obey
and
the
reluctance
of
their
own
immediate
satellites
afforded
the
convention
an
indifferent
omen
of
the
respect
which
was
likely
to
be
paid
without
doors
to
their
decree
against
this
powerful
demagogue
subsequent
events
seemed
for
a
while
to
confirm
the
apprehensions
thus
excited
the
convention
had
declared
their
sitting
permanent
and
had
taken
all
precautions
for
appealing
for
protection
to
the
large
mass
of
citizens
who
wearied
out
by
the
reign
of
terror
were
desirous
to
close
it
at
all
hazards
they
quickly
had
deputations
from
several
of
the
neighbouring
sections
declaring
their
adherence
to
the
national
representatives
in
whose
defence
they
were
arming
and
many
undoubtedly
prepared
were
marching
in
all
haste
to
the
protection
of
the
convention
but
they
heard
also
the
less
pleasing
tidings
that
henriot
having
effected
the
dispersion
of
those
citizens
who
had
obstructed
as
elsewhere
mentioned
the
execution
of
the
eighty
condemned
persons
and
consummated
that
final
act
of
murder
was
approaching
the
tuileries
where
they
had
held
their
sitting
with
a
numerous
staff
and
such
of
the
jacobinical
forces
as
could
hastily
be
collected
happily
for
the
convention
this
commandant
of
the
national
guards
on
whose
presence
of
mind
and
courage
the
fate
of
france
perhaps
for
the
moment
depended
was
as
stupid
and
cowardly
as
he
was
brutally
ferocious
he
suffered
himself
without
resistance
to
be
arrested
by
a
few
gendarmes
the
immediate
guards
of
the
convention
headed
by
two
of
its
members
who
behaved
in
the
emergency
with
equal
prudence
and
spirit
but
fortune
or
the
demon
whom
he
had
served
afforded
robespierre
another
chance
for
safety
perhaps
even
for
empire
for
moments
which
a
man
of
might
have
employed
for
escape
one
of
desperate
courage
might
have
used
for
victory
which
considering
the
divided
and
extremely
unsettled
state
of
the
capital
was
likely
to
be
gained
by
the
boldest
competitor
sidenote
terrorists
at
the
hotel
de
ville
the
arrested
deputies
had
been
carried
from
one
prison
to
another
all
the
jailors
refusing
to
receive
under
their
official
charge
robespierre
and
those
who
had
aided
him
in
supplying
their
dark
habitations
with
such
a
tide
of
successive
inhabitants
at
length
the
prisoners
were
secured
in
the
office
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
but
by
this
time
all
was
in
alarm
amongst
the
commune
of
paris
where
fleuriot
the
mayor
and
payan
the
successor
of
hébert
convoked
the
civic
body
despatched
municipal
officers
to
raise
the
city
and
the
fauxbourgs
in
their
name
and
caused
the
tocsin
to
be
rung
payan
speedily
assembled
a
force
sufficient
to
liberate
henriot
robespierre
and
the
other
arrested
deputies
and
to
carry
them
to
the
hôtel
de
ville
where
about
two
thousand
men
were
congregated
consisting
chiefly
of
artillerymen
and
of
insurgents
from
the
suburb
of
saint
antoine
who
already
expressed
their
resolution
of
marching
against
the
convention
but
the
selfish
and
cowardly
character
of
robespierre
was
unfit
for
such
a
crisis
he
appeared
altogether
confounded
and
overwhelmed
with
what
had
passed
and
was
passing
around
him
and
not
one
of
all
the
victims
of
the
reign
of
terror
felt
its
disabling
influence
so
completely
as
he
the
despot
who
had
so
long
directed
its
sway
he
had
not
even
though
the
means
must
have
been
in
his
power
the
presence
of
mind
to
disperse
money
in
considerable
sums
which
of
itself
would
not
have
failed
to
ensure
the
support
of
the
revolutionary
rabble
meantime
the
convention
continued
to
maintain
the
bold
and
commanding
front
which
they
had
so
suddenly
and
critically
assumed
upon
learning
the
escape
of
the
arrested
deputies
and
hearing
of
the
insurrection
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
they
instantly
passed
a
decree
outlawing
robespierre
and
his
associates
inflicting
a
similar
doom
upon
the
mayor
of
paris
the
procureur
and
other
members
of
the
commune
and
charging
twelve
of
their
members
the
boldest
who
could
be
selected
to
proceed
with
the
armed
force
to
the
execution
of
the
sentence
the
drums
of
the
national
guards
now
beat
to
arms
in
all
the
sections
under
authority
of
the
convention
while
the
tocsin
continued
to
summon
assistance
with
its
iron
voice
to
robespierre
and
the
civic
magistrates
every
thing
appeared
to
threaten
a
violent
catastrophe
until
it
was
seen
clearly
that
the
public
voice
and
especially
amongst
the
national
guards
was
declaring
itself
generally
against
the
terrorists
the
hôtel
de
ville
was
surrounded
by
about
fifteen
hundred
men
and
cannon
turned
upon
the
doors
the
force
of
the
assailants
was
weakest
in
point
of
number
but
their
leaders
were
men
of
spirit
and
night
concealed
their
inferiority
of
force
the
deputies
commissioned
for
the
purpose
read
the
decree
of
the
assembly
to
those
whom
they
found
assembled
in
front
of
the
and
they
shrunk
from
the
attempt
of
defending
it
some
joining
the
assailants
others
laying
down
their
arms
and
dispersing
meantime
the
deserted
group
of
terrorists
within
conducted
themselves
like
scorpions
which
when
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
fire
are
said
to
turn
their
stings
on
each
other
and
on
themselves
mutual
and
ferocious
upbraiding
took
place
among
these
miserable
men
wretch
were
these
the
means
you
promised
to
furnish
said
coffinhal
to
henriot
whom
he
found
intoxicated
and
incapable
of
resolution
or
exertion
and
seizing
on
him
as
he
spoke
he
precipitated
the
revolutionary
general
from
a
window
henriot
survived
the
fall
only
to
drag
himself
into
a
drain
in
which
he
was
afterwards
discovered
and
brought
out
to
execution
the
younger
robespierre
threw
himself
from
the
window
but
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
perish
on
the
spot
it
seemed
as
if
even
the
melancholy
fate
of
suicide
the
last
refuge
of
guilt
and
despair
was
denied
to
men
who
had
so
long
refused
every
species
of
mercy
to
their
le

alone
had
calmness
enough
to
despatch
himself
with

after

comrades
to
kill
him

with
an
irresolute
hand
and

couthon
lay
beneath
the
table
brandishing
a
knife
with
which
he
repeatedly
wounded
his
bosom
without
daring
to
add
force
enough
to
reach
his
heart
their
chief
robespierre
in
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
shoot
himself
had
only
inflicted
a
horrible
fracture
on
his
under
jaw
in
this
situation
they
were
found
like
wolves
in
their
lair
foul
with
blood
mutilated
despairing
and
yet
not
able
to
die
robespierre
lay
on
a
table
in
an
his
head
supported
by
a
and
his
hideous
countenance
half
hidden
by
a
bloody
and
dirty
cloth
bound
round
the
shattered
chin
the
captives
were
carried
in
triumph
to
the
convention
who
refusing
to
admit
them
to
the
bar
sent
them
before
the
revolutionary
tribunal
which
ordered
them
as
outlaws
for
instant
execution
as
the
fatal
cars
passed
to
the
guillotine
those
who
filled
them
but
especially
robespierre
were
overwhelmed
with
execrations
from
the
friends
and
relatives
of
victims
whom
he
had
sent
on
the
same
melancholy
road
the
nature
of
his
previous
wound
from
which
the
cloth
had
never
been
removed
till
the
executioner
tore
it
off
added
to
the
torture
of
the
sufferer
the
shattered
jaw
dropped
and
the
wretch
yelled
aloud
to
the
horror
of
the
spectators
a
mask
taken
from
that
dreadful
head
was
long
exhibited
in
different
nations
of
europe
and
appalled
the
spectator
by
its
ugliness
and
the
mixture
of
fiendish
expression
with
that
of
bodily
agony
at
the
same
time
fell
young
robespierre
couthon
saint
just
coffinhal
henriot
dumas
president
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
the
mayor
and
fourteen
of
their
subalterns

character
of
robespierre
thus
fell
maximilian
robespierre
after
having
been
the
first
person
in
the
french
republic
for
nearly
two
years
during
which
time
he
governed
it
upon
the
principles
of
nero
or
caligula
his
elevation
to
the
situation
which
he
held
involved
more
contradictions
than
perhaps
attach
to
any
similar
event
in
history
a
and
tyrant
was
permitted
to
rule
with
the
rod
of
the
most
frightful
despotism
a
people
whose
anxiety
for
liberty
had
shortly
before
rendered
them
unable
to
endure
the
rule
of
a
humane
and
lawful
sovereign
a
dastardly
coward
arose
to
the
command
of
one
of
the
bravest
nations
in
the
world
and
it
was
under
the
auspices
of
a
man
who
dared
scarce
fire
a
pistol
that
the
greatest
generals
in
france
began
their
careers
of
conquest
he
had
neither
eloquence
nor
imagination
but
substituted
in
their
stead
a
miserable
affected
bombastic
style
which
until
other
circumstances
gave
him
consequence
drew
on
him
general
ridicule
yet
against
so
poor
an
orator
all
the
eloquence
of
the
philosophical
girondists
all
the
terrible
powers
of
his
associate
danton
employed
in
a
popular
assembly
could
not
enable
them
to
make
an
effectual
resistance
it
may
seem
trifling
to
mention
that
in
a
nation
where
a
good
deal
of
prepossession
is
excited
by
amiable
manners
and
beauty
of
external
appearance
the
person
who
ascended
to
the
highest
power
was
not
only
but
singularly
mean
in
person
awkward
and
constrained
in
his
address
ignorant
how
to
set
about
pleasing
even
when
he
most
desired
to
give
pleasure
and
as
tiresome
nearly
as
he
was
odious
and
heartless
to
compensate
all
these
deficiencies
robespierre
had
but
an
insatiable
ambition
founded
on
a
vanity
which
made
him
think
himself
capable
of
filling
the
highest
situation
and
therefore
gave
him
daring
when
to
dare
is
frequently
to
achieve
he
mixed
a
false
and
overstrained
but
rather
fluent
species
of
bombastic
composition
with
the
grossest
flattery
to
the
lowest
classes
of
the
people
in
consideration
of
which
they
could
not
but
receive
as
genuine
the
praises
which
he
always
bestowed
on
himself
his
prudent
resolution
to
be
satisfied
with
possessing
the
essence
of
power
without
seeming
to
desire
its
rank
and
trappings
formed
another
art
of
cajoling
the
multitude
his
watchful
envy
his
but
sure
revenge
his
craft
which
to
vulgar
minds
supplies
the
place
of
wisdom
were
his
only
means
of
competing
with
his
distinguished
antagonists
and
it
seems
to
have
been
a
merited
punishment
of
the
extravagances
and
abuses
of
the
french
revolution
that
it
engaged
the
country
in
a
state
of
anarchy
which
permitted
a
wretch
such
as
we
have
described
to
be
for
a
long
period
master
of
her
destiny
blood
was
his
element
like
that
of
the
other
terrorists
and
he
never
fastened
with
so
much
pleasure
on
a
new
victim
as
when
he
was
at
the
same
time
an
ancient
associate
in
an
epitaph
of
which
the
following
couplet
may
serve
as
a
translation
his
life
was
represented
as
incompatible
with
the
existence
of
the
human
race
here
lies
robespierre
let
no
tear
be
shed
reader
if
he
had
lived
thou
hadst
been
dead
when
the
report
of
robespierre
crimes
was
brought
to
the
convention
in
which
he
is
most
justly
charged
with
the
intention
of
possessing
himself
of
the
government
the
inconsistent
accusation
is
added
that
he
plotted
to
restore
the
bourbons
in
support
of
which
it
is
alleged
that
a
seal
bearing
a

found
at
the
hôtel

crimes
of
robespierre
were
thought
sufficiently
atrocious
without
their
being
mingled
with
a
tendency
to
royalism
sidenote
the
thermidoriens
with
this
celebrated
demagogue
the
reign
of
terror
may
be
said
to
have
terminated
although
those
by
whose
agency
the
tyrant
fell
were
as
much
terrorists
as
himself
being
indeed
the
principal
members
of
the
very
committees
of
public
safety
and
public
security
who
had
been
his
colleagues
in
all
the
excesses
of
his
revolutionary
authority
among
the
as
the
actors
in
robespierre
downfall
termed
themselves
there
were
names
almost
as
dreadful
as
that
of
the
dictator
for
whom
the
ninth
thermidor
proved
the
ides
of
march
what
could
be
hoped
for
from
collot

butcher
of
the
lyonnois

double
red
from
to
elbow
in
the
blood
of
the
unfortunate
emigrant
gentlemen
who
were
made
prisoners
at
quiberon
it
seemed
that
only
a
new
set
of
septembrisers
had
succeeded
and
that
the
same
horrible
principle
would
continue
to
be
the
moving
spring
of
the
government
under
the
direction
of
other
chiefs
indeed
but
men
who
were
scarce
less
familiar
with
its
horrors
than
was
the
departed
tyrant
men
looked
hopelessly
towards
the
convention
long
rather
like
the
corpse
of
a
legislative
assembly
actuated
during
its
apparent
activity
like
the
supposed
vampire
by
an
infernal
spirit
not
its
own
which
urged
it
to
go
forth
and
drink
blood
but
which
deserted
by
the
animating
demon
must
it
was
to
be
expected
sink
to
the
ground
in
helpless
incapacity
what
could
be
expected
from
barrère
the
ready
panegyrist
of
robespierre
the
tool
who
was
ever
ready
to
show
to
the
weak
and
the
timid
the
exact
point
where
their
safety
recommended
to
them
to
join
the
ranks
of
the
wicked
and
the
strong
but
in
spite
of
these
discouraging
circumstances
the
feelings
of
humanity
and
a
spirit
of
dictating
a
determined
resistance
to
the
renovation
of
the
horrid
system
under
which
the
country
had
so
long
suffered

to
show
itself
both
in
the
convention
and
without
doors
encouraged
by
the
fall
of
robespierre
complaints
poured
in
against
his
agents
on
all
sides
lebon
was
accused
before
the
convention
by
a
deputation
from
cambrai
and
as
he
ascended
the
tribune
to
put
himself
on
his
defence
he
was
generally
hailed
as
the
hangman
of
robespierre
the
impudence
supported
him
in
a
sort
of
defence
and
when
it
was
objected
to
him
that
he
had
had
the
common
executioner

with
him
he
answered
that
delicate
people
might
think
that
wrong
but
lequinio
another
jacobin
proconsul
of
horrible
celebrity
had
made
the
same
useful
citizen
the
companion
of
his
leisure
and
hours
of
relaxation
he
acknowledged
with
the
same
equanimity
that
an
aristocrat
being
condemned
to
the
guillotine
he
kept
him
lying
in
the
usual
posture
upon
his
back
with
his
eyes
turned
up
to
the
axe
which
was
suspended
above
his
throat
in
short
in
all
the
agonies
which
can
agitate
the
human
mind
when
within
a
hair
breadth
of
the
distance
of
the
great
separation
between
time
and
eternity
until
he
had
read
to
him
at
length
the
gazette
which
had
just
arrived
giving
an
account
of
a
victory
gained
by
the
republican
armies
this
monster
with
heron
rossignol
and
other
agents
of
terror
more
immediately
connected
with
robespierre
were
ordered
for
arrest
and
shortly
after
for
execution
tallien
and
barras
would
have
here
paused
in
the
retrospect
but
similar
accusations
now
began
to
pour
in
from
every
quarter
and
when
once
stated
were
such
as
commanded
public
attention
in
the
most
forcible
manner
those
who
invoked
vengeance
backed
the
solicitations
of
each
other
the
general
voice
of
mankind
was
with
them
and
leaders
who
had
shared
the
excesses
of
the
reign
of
terror
thermidoriens
as
they
were
began
to
see
some
danger
of
being
themselves
buried
in
the
ruins
of
the
power
which
they
had
overthrown
tallien
who
is
supposed
to
have
taken
the
lead
in
the
extremely
difficult
navigation
which
lay
before
the
vessel
of
the
state
seems
to
have
experienced
a
change
in
his
own
sentiments
at
least
his
principles
of
action
inclining
him
to
the
cause
of
humanity
he
was
also
it
is
said
urged
to
so
favourable
a
modification
of
feelings
by
his
newly
married
wife
formerly
madame
fontenai
who
bred
a
royalist
had
herself
been
a
victim
to
the
law
of
suspicion
and
was
released
from
a
prison
to
receive
the
hand
and
influence
the
activity
of
the
republican
statesman
barras
who
as
commanding
the
armed
force
might
be
termed
the
hero
of
the
thermidor
was
supposed
to
be
also
inclined
towards
humanity
and
moderation
thus
disposed
to
destroy
the
monstrous
system
which
had
taken
root
in
france
and
which
indeed
in
the
increasing
impatience
of
the
country
they
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
maintain
tallien
and
barras
had
to
struggle
at
the
same
time
to
diminish
and
restrict
the
general
demand
for
revenge
at
a
time
when
if
past
tyranny
was
to
be
strictly
inquired
into
and
punished
the
doom
as
carrier
himself
told
them
would
have
involved
every
thing
in
the
convention
not
excepting
the
president
bell
and
his
so
powerful
were
these
feelings
of
resisting
a
retrospect
that
the
thermidoriens
declined
to
support
le
cointre
in
bringing
forward
a
general
charge
of
inculpation
against
the
two
committees
of
public
safety
and
public
security
in
which
accusation
notwithstanding
their
ultimate
quarrel
with
robespierre
he
showed
their
intimate
connexion
with
him
and
their
joint
agency
in
all
which
had
been
imputed
to
him
as
guilt
but
the
time
was
not
mature
for
hazarding
such
a
general
accusation
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
convention
with
marks
of
extreme
displeasure
sidenote
freedom
of
the
press
still
however
the
general
voice
of
humanity
demanded
some
farther
atonement
for
two
years
of
outrage
and
to
satisfy
this
demand
the
thermidoriens
set
themselves
to
seek
victims
connected
more
immediately
with
robespierre
while
they
endeavoured
gradually
to
form
a
party
which
setting
out
upon
a
principle
of
amnesty
and
oblivion
of
the
past
should
in
future
pay
some
regard
to
that
preservation
of
the
lives
and
property
of
the
governed
which
in
every
other
system
saving
that
which
had
been
just
overthrown
in
france
is
regarded
as
the
principal
end
of
civil
government
with
a
view
to
the
consolidation
of
such
a
party
the
restrictions
of
the
press
were
removed
and
men
of
talent
and
literature
silenced
during
the
reign
of
robespierre
were
once
more
admitted
to
exercise
their
natural
influence
in
favour
of
civil
order
and
religion
marmontel
la
harpe
and
others
who
in
their
youth
had
been
enrolled
in
the
list
of
voltaire
disciples
and
amongst
the
infidels
of
the
encyclopédie
now
made
amends
for
their
youthful
errors
by
exerting
themselves
in
the
cause
of
good
morals
and
of
a
regulated
government
at
length
followed
that
general
and
measure
which
gave
liberty
to
so
many
thousands
by
suspending
the
law
denouncing
suspected
persons
and
emptying
at
once
of
their
inhabitants
the
prisons
which
had
hitherto
only
transmitted
them
to
the
guillotine
the
tales
which
these
victims
of
jacobinism
had
to
repeat
when
revealing
the
secrets
of
their
together
with
the
moral
influence
produced
by
such
a
universal
and
the
reunion
which
it
effected
amongst
friends
and
relations
that
had
been
so
long
separated
tended
greatly
to
strengthen
the
hands
of
the
thermidoriens
who
still
boasted
of
that
name
and
to
consolidate
a
rational
and
moderate
party
both
in
the
capital
and
provinces
it
is
however
by
no
means
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
liberated
sufferers
showed
a
disposition
to
exercise
retribution
in
a
degree
which
their
liberators
trembled
to
indulge
lest
it
might
have
recoiled
upon
themselves
still
both
parties
united
against
the
remains
of
the
jacobins
a
singular
and
melancholy
species
of
force
supported
these
movements
towards
civilisation
and
order
it
was
levied
among
the
orphans
and
youthful
friends
of
those
who
had
fallen
under
the
fatal
guillotine
and
amounted
in
number
to
two
or
three
thousand
young
men
who
acted
in
concert
were
distinguished
by
black
collars
and
by
their
hair
being
plaited
and
turned
up
la
as
prepared
for
the
guillotine
this
costume
was
adopted
in
memory
of
the
principle
of
mourning
on
which
they
were
associated
these
volunteers
were
not
regularly
armed
or
disciplined
but
formed
a
sort
of
free
corps
who
opposed
themselves
readily
and
effectually
to
the
jacobins
when
they
attempted
their
ordinary
revolutionary
tactics
of
exciting
partial
insurrections
and
intimidating
the
orderly
citizens
by
shouts
and
violence
many
scuffles
took
place
betwixt
the
parties
with
various
success
but
ultimately
the
spirit
and
courage
of
the
young
avengers
seemed
to
give
them
daily
a
more
decided
superiority
the
jacobins
dared
not
show
themselves
that
is
to
avouch
their
principles
either
at
the
places
of
public
amusement
or
in
the
palais
royal
or
the
tuileries
all
of
which
had
formerly
witnessed
their
victories
their
assemblies
now
took
place
under
some
appearance
of
secrecy
and
were
held
in
remote
streets
and
with
such
marks
of
diminished
audacity
as
augured
that
the
spirit
of
the
party
was
still
however
the
jacobin
party
possessed
dreadful
leaders
in
and
collot
who
repeatedly
attempted
to
awaken
its
terrific
energy
these
demagogues
had
joined
indeed
in
the
struggle
against
robespierre
but
it
was
with
the
expectation
that
an
amurath
was
to
succeed
an
amurath
a
jacobin
a
jacobin
not
for
the
purpose
of
relaxing
the
reins
of
the
revolutionary
government
far
less
changing
its
character
these
veteran
revolutionists
must
be
considered
as
separate
from
those
who
called
themselves
thermidoriens
though
they
lent
their
assistance
to
the
revolution
on
the
thermidor
they
viewed
as
deserters
and
apostates
legendre
le
cointre
and
others
above
all
tallien
and
barras
who
in
the
full
height
of
their
career
had
paused
to
take
breath
and
were
now
endeavouring
to
shape
a
course
so
different
from
that
which
they
had
hitherto
pursued
sidenote
jacobin
club
reopened
these
genuine
endeavoured
to
rest
their
own
power
and
popularity
upon
the
same
basis
as
formerly
they
reopened
the
sittings
of
the
jacobin
club
shut
up
on
the
thermidor
this
ancient
revolutionary
cavern
again
heard
its
roof
resound
with
denunciations
by
which
vadier
and
others
devoted
to
the
infernal
deities
le
cointre
and
those
who
they
complained
wished
to
involve
all
honest
republicans
in
the
charges
brought
against
robespierre
and
his
friends
those
threats
however
were
no
longer
rapidly
followed
by
the
thunderbolts
which
used
to
attend
such
flashes
of
jacobin
eloquence
men
homes
were
now
in
comparison
safe
a
man
might
be
named
in
a
jacobin
club
as
an
aristocrat
or
a
moderate
and
yet
live
in
fact
the
demagogues
were
more
anxious
to
secure
immunity
for
their
past
crimes
than
at
present
to
incur
new
censure
the
tide
of
general
opinion
was
flowing
strongly
against
them
and
a
singular
incident
increased
its
power
and
rendered
it
irresistible
the
parisians
had
naturally
enough
imagined
that
the
provinces
could
have
no
instances
of
jacobinical
cruelty
and
misrule
to
describe
more
tragic
and
appalling
than
the
numerous
executions
which
the
capital
had
exhibited
every
day
but
the
arrival
of
eighty
prisoners
citizens
of
nantes
charged
with
the
usual
imputations
cast
upon
suspected
persons
undeceived
them
these
captives
had
been
sent
for
the
purpose
of
being
tried
at
paris
before
the
revolutionary
tribunal
fortunately
they
did
not
arrive
till
after
robespierre
fall
and
consequently
when
they
were
looked
upon
rather
as
oppressed
persons
than
as
criminals
and
were
listened
to
more
as
accusers
of
those
by
whom
they
were
persecuted
than
as
culprits
on
their
defence
it
was
then
that
the
metropolis
first
heard
of
horrors
which
we
have
formerly
barely
hinted
at
it
was
then
they
were
told
of
crowds
of
citizens
most
of
whom
had
been
favourable
to
the
republican
order
of
things
and
had
borne
arms
against
the
vendéans
in
their
attack
upon
nantes
men
accused
upon
grounds
equally
slight
and
incapable
of
proof
having
been
piled
together
in
dungeons
where
the
air
was
pestilential
from
ordure
from
the
carcasses
of
the
dead
and
the
infectious
diseases
of
the
dying
it
was
then
they
heard
of
republican
baptism
and
republican
marriages
of
men
women
and
children
sprawling
together
like
toads
and
frogs
in
the
season
of
spring
in
the
waters
of
the
loire
too
shallow
to
afford
them
instant
death
it
was
then
they
heard
of
a
hundred
other
abominations
how
those
uppermost
upon
the
expiring
mass
prayed
to
be
thrust
into
the
deeper
water
that
they
might
have
the
means
of
death
and
of
much
more
that
humanity
forbears
to
detail
but
in
regard
to
which
the
sharp
sudden
and
sure
blow
of
the
parisian
guillotine
was
clemency
sidenote
trial
of
carrier
this
tale
of
horrors
could
not
be
endured
and
the
point
of
immediate
collision
between
the
thermidoriens
compelled
and
driven
onward
by
the
public
voice
and
feeling
and
the
remnant
of
the
old
jacobin
faction
became
the
accusation
of
carrier
the
commissioned
deputy
under
whom
these
horrors
had
been
perpetrated
vengeance
on
the
head
of
this
wretch
was
so
loudly
demanded
that
it
could
not
be
denied
even
by
those
influential
persons
who
themselves
deeply
interested
in
preventing
recrimination
would
willingly
have
drawn
a
veil
over
the
past
through
the
whole
impeachment
and
defence
the
thermidoriens
stood
on
the
most
delicate
and
embarrassing
ground
for
horrid
as
his
actions
were
he
had
in
general
their
own
authority
to
plead
for
them
for
example
a
letter
was
produced
with
these
directions
to
general
haxo
it
is
my
plan
to
carry
off
from
that
accursed
country
all
manner
of
subsistence
or
provisions
for
man
or
beast
all
forage
in
a
word
give
all
the
buildings
to
the
flames
and
exterminate
the
whole
inhabitants
oppose
their
being
relieved
by
a
single
grain
of
corn
for
their
subsistence
i
give
thee
the
most
positive
most
imperious
order
thou
art
answerable
for
the
execution
from
this
moment
in
a
word
leave
nothing
in
that
proscribed
country
let
the
means
of
subsistence
provisions
forage
every
thing
absolutely
every
thing
be
removed
to
nantes
the
representatives
of
the
french
nation
heard
with
horror
such
a
fiendish
commission
but
with
what
sense
of
shame
and
abasement
must
they
have
listened
to
carrier
defence
in
which
he
proved
he
was
only
literally
executing
the
decrees
of
the
very
convention
which
was
now
inquiring
into
his
conduct
a
lunatic
who
in
a
lucid
moment
hears
some
one
recount
the
crimes
and
cruelties
he
committed
in
his
frenzy
might
perhaps
enter
into
their
feelings
they
were
not
the
less
obliged
to
continue
the
inquiry
fraught
as
it
was
with
circumstances
so
disgraceful
to
themselves
and
impeachment
and
conviction
proved
the
point
on
which
the
thermidoriens
and
those
who
continued
to
entertain
the
violent
popular
opinions
were
now
at
issue
the
atrocious
carrier
was
taken
under
the
avowed
protection
of
the
jacobin
club
before
which
audience
he
made
out
a
case
which
was
heard
with
applause
he
acknowledged
his
enormities
and
pleaded
his
patriotic
zeal
ridiculed
the
delicacy
of
those
who
cared
whether
an
aristocrat
died
by
a
single
blow
or
a
protracted
death
was
encouraged
throughout
by
acclamations
and
received
assurances
of
protection
from
the
remnant
of
that
once
formidable
association
but
their
magic
influence
was
dissolved
their
best
orators
had
fallen
successively
by
each
impeachment
and
of
their
most
active
ruffians
some
had
been
killed
or
executed
some
had
fled
or
lay
concealed
many
were
in
custody
and
the
rest
had
become
intimidated
scarce
a
man
who
had
signalized
himself
in
the
french
revolution
but
had
enjoyed
the
applause
of
these
demagogues
as
versatile
in
personal
attachments
as
steady
in
their
execrable
principles
scarce
one
whom
they
had
not
been
active
in
sacrificing
nevertheless
those
members
of
the
revolutionary
committees
who
had
so
lately
lent
their
aid
to
dethrone
robespierre
the
last
idol
of
the
society
ventured
to
invoke
them
in
their
own
defence
and
that
of
their
late
agents
addressing
the
jacobins
spoke
of
the
convention
as
men
spared
by
their
clemency
during
the
reign
of
robespierre
who
now
rewarded
the
mountain
deputies
by
terming
them
men
of
blood
and
by
seeking
the
death
of
those
worthy
patriots
joseph
lebon
and
carrier
who
were
about
to
fall
under
their
violence
these
excellent
citizens
he
said
were
persecuted
merely
because
their
zeal
for
the
republic
had
been
somewhat
ardent
their
forms
of
proceeding
a
little
rash
and
severe
he
invoked
the
awaking
of
the
lion
a
new
revolutionary
rising
of
the
people
to
tear
the
limbs
and
drink
the
blood
these
were
the
very
words
of
those
who
had
dared
to
beard
them
the
meeting
dispersed
with
shouts
and
vows
to
answer
to
the
halloo
of
their
leaders
but
the
opposite
party
had
learned
that
such
menaces
were
to
be
met
otherwise
than
by
merely
awaiting
the
issue
and
then
trying
the
force
of
remonstrances
or
the
protection
of
the
law
with
those
to
whom
the
stronger
force
is
the
only
satisfying
reason
well
organized
and
directed
by
military
officers
in
many
instances
large
bands
of
as
we
may
venture
to
call
the
volunteer
force
already
mentioned
appeared
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
suburbs
and
kept
in
check
those
from
whom
the
mother
club
expected
its
strongest
aid
while
the
main
body
of
the
young
avengers
marched
down
upon
the
citadel
of
the
enemy
and
invested
the
jacobin
club
itself
in
the
midst
of
its
sitting
these
demagogues
made
but
a
wretched
defence
when
attacked
by
that
species
of
popular
violence
which
they
had
always
considered
as
their
own
especial
weapon
and
the
facility
with
which
they
were
dispersed
amid
ridicule
and
ignominy
served
to
show
how
easily
on
former
occasions
the
mutual
understanding
and
spirited
exertion
of
men
could
have
at
any
time
prevented
criminal
violence
from
obtaining
the
mastery
had
la
fayette
marched
against
and
shut
up
the
jacobin
club
the
world
would
have
been
spared
many
horrors
and
in
all
probability
he
would
have
found
the
task
as
easy
as
it
proved
to
those
bands
of
incensed
young
it
must
be
mentioned
though
the
recital
is
almost
unworthy
of
history
that
the
female
jacobins
came
to
rally
and
assist
their
male
associates
and
that
several
of
them
were
seized
upon
and
punished
in
a
manner
which
might
excellently
suit
their
merits
but
which
shows
that
the
young
associates
for
maintaining
order
were
not
sufficiently
aristocratic
to
be
under
the
absolute
restraints
imposed
by
the
rules
of
chivalry
it
is
impossible
however
to
grudge
the
flagellation
administered
upon
this
memorable
occasion
when
the
jacobins
had
thus
fallen
in
the
popular
contest
they
could
expect
little
success
in
the
convention
and
the
less
that
the
impulse
of
general
feeling
seemed
about
to
recall
into
that
assembly
by
the
reversal
of
their
outlawry
the
remnant
of
the
unhappy
girondists
and
other
members
who
had
been
arbitrarily
proscribed
on
the
of
may
the
measure
was
delayed
for
some
time
as
tending
to
effect
a
change
in
the
composition
of
the
house
which
the
ruling
party
might
find
inconvenient
at
length
upwards
of
sixty
deputies
were
first
declared
free
of
the
outlawry
and
finally
into
the
bosom
of
the
convention
with
heads
which
had
been
so
long
worn
in
insecurity
that
it
had
greatly
cooled
their
love
of
political
theory
in
the
meantime
the
government
through
means
of
a
revolutionary
tribunal
acting
however
with
much
more
of
legal
formality
and
caution
than
that
of
robespierre
made
a
sacrifice
to
the
public
desire
of
vengeance
lebon
carrier
already
mentioned
the
public
accuser
under
robespierre
and
one
or
two
others
of
the
same
class
selected
on
account
of
the
peculiar
infamy
and
cruelty
of
their
conduct
were
condemned
and
executed
as
an
atonement
for
injured
humanity
here
probably
the
thermidoriens
would
have
wished
the
reaction
to
stop
but
this
was
impossible
barras
and
tallien
perceived
plainly
that
with
whatever
caution
and
clemency
they
might
proceed
towards
their
old
allies
of
the
mountain
there
was
still
no
hope
of
any
thing
like
reconciliation
and
that
their
best
policy
was
to
get
rid
of
them
as
speedily
and
as
quietly
as
they
could

a
hydra
whose
heads
bourgeoned
according
to
the
poetic
expression
as
fast
as
they
were
cut
off
continued
to
hiss
at
and
menace
the
government
with
unwearied
malignity
and
to
agitate
the
metropolis
by
their
intrigues
which
were
the
more
easily
conducted
that
the
winter
was
severe
bread
had
become
scarce
and
and
the
common
people
of
course
angry
and
discontented
scarcity
is
always
the
grievance
of
which
the
lower
classes
must
be
most
sensible
and
when
it
is
remembered
that
robespierre
though
at
the
expense
of
the
grossest
injustice
to
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
always
kept
bread
beneath
a
certain
or
fixed
price
in
the
metropolis
it
will
not
be
wondered
at
that
the
population
of
paris
should
be
willing
to
favour
those
who
followed
his
maxims
the
impulse
of
these
feelings
joined
to
the
machinations
of
the
jacobins
showed
itself
in
many
disorders
sidenote
jacobin
chiefs
banished
at
length
the
convention
pressed
by
shame
on
the
one
side
and
fear
on
the
other
saw
the
necessity
of
some
active
measure
and
appointed
a
commission
to
consider
and
report
upon
the
conduct
of
the
four
most
obnoxious
jacobin
chiefs
collot
vadier
and
barrère
the
report
was
of
course
unfavourable
yet
upon
the
case
being
considered
the
convention
were
satisfied
to
condemn
them
to
transportation
to
cayenne
some
resistance
was
offered
to
this
sentence
so
mild
in
proportion
to
what
those
who
underwent
it
had
been
in
the
habit
of
inflicting
but
it
was
borne
down
and
the
sentence
was
carried
into
execution
collot

demolisher

depopulator
of

said
to
have
died
in

spirits
spent
his
time
in
teaching
the
innocent
parrots
of
guiana
the
frightful
jargon
of
the
revolutionary
committee
and
finally
perished
in
misery
these
men
both
belonged
to
that
class
of
atheists
who
looking
up
towards
heaven
loudly
and
literally
defied
the
deity
to
make
his
existence
known
by
launching
his
thunderbolts
miracles
are
not
wrought
on
the
challenge
of
a
blasphemer
more
than
on
the
demand
of
a
sceptic
but
both
these
unhappy
men
had
probably
before
their
death
reason
to
confess
that
in
abandoning
the
wicked
to
their
own
free
will
a
greater
penalty
results
even
in
this
life
than
if
providence
had
been
pleased
to
inflict
the
immediate
doom
which
they
had
impiously
defied

the

the

of

in
a
great
measure

history
of
jacobinism

of
the
mountain
of
those
in
short
who
professed
the
most
outrageous
popular
doctrines
considered
as
a
political
body
they
continued
to
receive
great
facilities
from
the
increasing
dearth
and
to
find
ready
opportunities
of
agitating
the
discontented
part
of
a
population
disgusted
by
the
diminution
not
only
of
comforts
but
of
the
very
means
of
subsistence
the
jacobins
therefore
were
easily
able
to
excite
an
insurrection
of
the
same
description
as
those
which
had
repeatedly
influenced
the
fate
of
the
revolution
and
which
in
fact
proceeded
to
greater
extremities
than
any
which
had
preceded
it
in
the

desperate
game
the
rallying
word
of
the
rabble
was

and
the
democratic
constitution
of
a
constitution
which
the
jacobins
had
projected
but
never
attempted
seriously
to
put
into
force
no
insurrection
had
yet
appeared
more
formidable
in
numbers

better
provided
in
pikes

on
a
pike
they
presented

the
president
with
the
motions
which
they
demanded
should
be
passed
but
were
defeated
by
the
firmness
with
which
he
preferred
his
duty
to

appearance
dispersed
with
very
little
effort
the
tumult
however
was
renewed
on
the
two
following
days
until
at

the
necessity
of
taking
sufficient
measures
to
end
it
at
once

for
ever
became
evident

all

at

of

marched
in
military
order
towards
the
fauxbourg
saint

which
had
poured
forth
repeatedly
the
bands
of
armed
insurgents
that
were
the
principal
force
of
the
jacobins
after
a
show
of
defending
themselves
the
inhabitants
of
this
disorderly
suburb
were
at
length
obliged
to
surrender
up
their
arms
of
every
kind
those
pikes
which
had
so
often
decided
the
destinies
of
france
were
now
delivered
up
by
cartloads
and
the
holy
right
of
insurrection
was
rendered
in
future
a
more
dangerous
and
difficult
task
encouraged
by
the
success
of
this
decisive
measure
the
government
proceeded
against
some
of
the
terrorists
whom
they
had
hitherto
spared
but
whose
fate
was
now
determined
in
order
to
strike
dismay
into
their
party
six
jacobins
accounted
among
the
most
ferocious
of
the
class
were
arrested
as
encouragers
of
the
late
insurrection
and
delivered
up
to
be
tried
by
a
military
commission
they
were
all
deputies
of
the
mountain
gang
certain
of
their
doom
they
adopted
a
desperate
resolution
among
the
whole
party
they
possessed
but
one
knife
but
they
resolved
it
should
serve
them
all
for
the
purpose
of
suicide
the
instant
their
sentence
was
pronounced
one
stabbed
himself
with
this
weapon
another
snatched
the
knife
from
his
companion
dying
hand
plunged
it
in
his
own
bosom
and
handed
it
to
the
third
who
imitated
the
dreadful
example
such
was
the
consternation
of
the
attendants
that
no
one
arrested
the
fatal
progress
of
the
weapon
all
fell
either
dead
or
desperately
wounded
the
last
were
despatched
by
the
guillotine
after
this
decisive
victory
and
last
dreadful
catastrophe
jacobinism
considered
as
a
pure
and
unmixed
party
can
scarce
be
said
to
have
again
raised
its
head
in
france
although
its
leaven
has
gone
to
qualify
and
characterise
in
some
degree
more
than
one
of
the
different
parties
which
have
succeeded
them
as
a
political
sect
the
jacobins
can
be
compared
to
none
that
ever
existed
for
none
but
themselves
ever
thought
of
an
organized
regular
and
continued
system
of
murdering
and
plundering
the
rich
that
they
might
debauch
the
poor
by
the
distribution
of
their
spoils
they
bear
however
some
resemblance
to
the
frantic
followers
of
john
of
leyden
and
knipperdoling
who
occupied
munster
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
committed
in
the
name
of
religion
the
same
frantic
horrors
which
the
french
jacobins
did
in
that
of
freedom
in
both
cases
the
courses
adopted
by
these
parties
were
most
foreign
to
and
inconsistent
with
the
alleged
motives
of
their
conduct
the
anabaptists
practised
every
species
of
vice
and
cruelty
by
the
dictates
they
said
of
inspiration
the
jacobins
imprisoned
three
hundred
thousand
of
their
countrymen
in
name
of
liberty
and
put
to
death
more
than
half
the
number
under
the
sanction
of
fraternity
now
at
length
however
society
began
to
resume
its
ordinary
course
and
the
business
and
pleasures
of
life
succeeded
each
other
as
usual
but
even
social
pleasures
brought
with
them
strange
and
gloomy
associations
with
that
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
through
which
the
late
pilgrimage
of
france
appeared
to
have
lain
an
assembly
for
dancing
very
much
frequented
by
the
young
of
both
sexes
and
highly
fashionable
was
called
the
ball
of
the
victims
the
qualification
for
attendance
was
the
having
lost
some
near
and
valued
relation
or
friend
in
the
late
reign
of
terror
the
hair
and
were
so
arranged
as
to
resemble
the
preparations
made
for
the
guillotine
and
the
motto
adopted
was
we
dance
amidst
tombs
in
no
country
but
france
could
the
incidents
have
taken
place
which
gave
rise
to
this
association
and
certainly
in
no
country
but
france
would
they
have
been
used
for
such
a
purpose
but
it
is
time
to
turn
from
the
consideration
of
the
internal
government
of
france
to
its
external
relations
in
regard
to
which
the
destinies
of
the
country
rose
to
such
a
distinguished
height
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
reconcile
the
two
pictures
of
a
nation
triumphant
at
every
point
against
all
europe
coalesced
against
her
making
efforts
and
obtaining
victories
to
which
history
had
been
yet
a
stranger
while
at
the
same
time
her
affairs
at
home
were
directed
by
ferocious
bloodthirsty
savages
such
as
robespierre
the
republic
regarded
in
her
foreign
and
domestic
relations
might
be
fancifully
compared
to
the
tomb
erected
over
some
hero
presenting
without
trophies
of
arms
and
the
emblems
of
victory
while
within
there
lies
only
a
mangled
and
corrupted
corpse

the

endeavouring
by

subterfuge

obtain

produced
a
piece
of
black
bread
which
a
dog
would
have
rejected
but
which
the
poor
were
obliged
to
eat
or
starve
he
besought

to
appoint
some
members
to
confer
with
those
deputed
by
the
nobility
and
clergy
upon
the
means
of
bettering
the
condition
of
the

the

perceived
the
snare
but
dared
not
openly
reject
the
proposal
as
it
would
render
them
unpopular

a

rose
and
after
professing
sentiments
in
favour
of
the
poor
still
stronger
than
those
of

adroitly
threw
doubts
upon
the
sincerity

intentions
avowed
by

said
he
to

tell

better

endeavour
by

means
to
make
us
swerve

the

we
have
taken

as
ministers

as
worthy
imitators

their
master
let
them
forego

luxury
which
surrounds
them

that
splendour
which
puts
indigence
to

their
origin
discharge

proud
lackeys
by
whom
they
are
attended

equipages
and

all
their
superfluous
wealth
into
food

speech

coincided
so
well

passions

not
elicit

him
he

nothing

as
that

very
indifferent
to

i
never

weary
of
contemplating
in
him
the
indifference
with
which
he
has

presented
a
slight
sketch
of
the
perilous
state
of
france
in
surrounded
by
foes
on
almost
every
frontier
and
with
difficulty
maintaining
her
ground
on
any
point
yet
the
lapse
of
two
years
found
her
victorious
nay
triumphantly
victorious
on
all
on
the
frontier
the
english
after
a
series
of
had
lost
not
only
flanders
on
which
we
left
them
advancing
but
holland
itself
and
had
been
finally
driven
with
great
loss
to
abandon
the
continent
the
king
of
prussia
had
set
out
on
his
first
campaign
as
the
chief
hero
of
the
coalition
and
had
engaged
that
the
duke
of
brunswick
his
general
should
put
down
the
revolution
in
france
as
easily
as
he
had
done
that
of
holland
but
finding
the
enterprise
which
he
had
undertaken
was
above
his
strength
that
his
accumulated
treasures
were
exhausted
in
an
unsuccessful
war
and
that
austria
not
prussia
was
regarded
as
the
head
of
the
coalition
he
drew
off
his
forces
after
they
had
been
weakened
by
more
than
one
defeat
and
made
a
separate
peace
with
france
in
which
he
renounced
to
the
new
republic
the
sovereignty
of
all
those
portions
of
the
prussian
territory
which
lay
on
the
east
side
of
the
rhine
the
king
to
make
up
for
these
losses
sought
a
more
profitable
though
less
honourable
field
of
warfare
and
concurred
with
russia
and
austria
in
effecting
by
conquest
a
final
partition
and
appropriation
of
poland
on
the
same
unprincipled
plan
on
which
the
first
had
been
conducted
spain
victorious
at
the
beginning
of
the
conquest
had
been
of
late
so
unsuccessful
in
opposing
the
french
armies
that
it
was
the
opinion
of
many
that
her
character
for
valour
and
patriotism
was
lost
for
ever
catalonia
was
by
the
republicans
rosas
taken
and
no
army
intervening
betwixt
the
victors
and
madrid
the
king
of
spain
was
obliged
to
clasp
hands
with
the
murderers
of
his
kinsman
louis
acknowledge
the
french
republic
and
withdraw
from
the
coalition
austria
had
well
sustained
her
ancient
renown
both
by
the
valour
of
her
troops
the
resolution
of
her
cabinet
and
the
talents
of
one
or
two
of
her
generals
the
archduke
charles
in
particular
and
the
veteran
wurmser
yet
she
too
had
succumbed
under
the
republican
superiority
belgium
as
the
french
called
flanders
was
as
already
stated
totally
lost
and
war
along
the
rhine
was
continued
by
austria
more
for
defence
than
with
a
hope
of
conquest
so
much
and
so
generally
had
the
fortune
of
war
declared
in
favour
of
france
upon
all
points
even
while
she
was
herself
sustaining
the
worst
of
evils
from
the
worst
of
tyrannies
there
must
have
been
unquestionably
several
reasons
for
such
success
as
seemed
to
attend
universally
on
the
arms
of
the
republic
instead
of
being
limited
to
one
peculiarly
efficient
army
or
to
one
distinguished
general
the
first
and
most
powerful
cause
must
be
looked
for
in
the
extraordinary
energy
of
the
republican
government
which
from
its
very
commencement
threw
all
subordinate
considerations
aside
and
devoted
the
whole
resources
of
the
country
to
its
military
defence
it
was
then
that
france
fully
learned
the
import
of
the
word
requisition
as
meaning
that
which
government
needs
and
which
must
at
all
hazards
be
supplied
compulsory
levies
were
universally
resorted
to
and
the
undoubted
right
which
a
state
has
to
call
upon
each
of
its
subjects
to
arise
in
defence
of
the
community
was
extended
into
the
power
of
sending
them
upon
expeditions
of
foreign
conquest
in
the
month
of
march
a
levy
of
two
hundred
thousand
men
was
appointed
and
took
place
but
by
a
subsequent
decree
of
the
august
in
the
same
year
a
more
gigantic
mode
of
recruiting
was
resorted
to
every
man
in
france
able
to
bear
arms
was
placed
at
the
orders
of
the
state
and
being
divided
into
classes
the
youngest
to
the
amount
of
five
hundred
thousand
afterwards
augmented
to
a
million
were
commanded
to
march
for
immediate
action
the
rest
of

were
to
be
so
disposed

as

the
efforts
of
the
actual

the
married
men
were
to
prepare

and
forward

the
women
to
make
uniforms
the
children
to
scrape
lint
and
the
old
men
to
preach
republicanism
all

was
in
like
manner
devoted
to
maintaining
the
war
all
buildings
were
put
to
military
purposes
all
arms
appropriated
to
the
public
service
and
all
horses
excepting
those
which
might
be
necessary
for
agriculture
seized
on
for
the
cavalry
and
other
military
services
representatives
of
the
people
were
named
to
march
with
the
various
levies
those
terrible
commissioners
who
punished
no
fault
with
a
slighter
penalty
than
death
no
excuse
was
sustained
for
want
of
personal
compliance
with
the
requisition
for
personal
service
no
delay
permitted
no
substitution
allowed
actual
and
literal
compliance
was
demanded
from
every
one

of
what

failed
to
appear

or

the
penalties
which
attached
to
emigration
by
successive
decrees
of
this
peremptory
nature
enforced
with
the
full
energy
of
revolutionary
violence
the
government
succeeded
in
bringing
into
the
field
and
maintaining
forces
to
an
amount
more
than
double
those
of
their
powerful
enemies
and
the
same

which

and
maintained
them
during
the
campaign
so
that
while
there
remained
food
and
clothing
of
any
kind
in
the
country
the
soldier
was
sure
to
be
fed
paid
and
equipped
there
are
countries
however
in
which
the
great
numerical
superiority
thus
attained
is
of
little
consequence
when
a
confused
levy
of
raw
inexperienced
and
disorderly
boys
are
opposed
against
the
ranks
of
a
much
smaller
but
a
regular
and
army
such
as
in
every
respect
is
that
of
austria
on
such
occasions
the
taunting
speech
of
alaric
recurs
to
recollection
the
thicker
the
hay
the
more
easily
it
is
mowed
but
this
was
not
found
to
be
the
case
with
the
youth
of
france
who
adopted
the
habits
most
necessary
for
a
soldier
with
singular
facility
and
readiness
military
service
has
been
popular
amongst
them
in
all
ages
and
the
stories
of
the
grandsire
in
a
french
cottage
have
always
tended
to
excite
in
his
descendants
ideas
familiar
with
a
military
condition
they
do
not
come
to
it
as
a
violent
change
of
life
which
they
had
never
previously
contemplated
and
where
all
is
new
and
terrible
but
as
to
a
duty
which
every
frenchman
is
liable
to
discharge
and
which
is
as
natural
to
him
as
to
his
father
or
grandfather
before
him
sidenote
military
genius
of
the
french
besides
this
propensity
and
undoubtedly
connected
with
it
a
young
frenchman
is
possessed
of
the
natural
character
most
desirable
in
the
soldier
he
is
accustomed
to
fare
hard
to
take
much
exercise
to
make
many
shifts
and
to
support
with
patience
occasional
deprivations
his
happy
gaiety
renders
him
indifferent
to
danger
his
patient
under
hardship
his
ingenuity
seems
to
amuse
as
well
as
to
assist
him
in
the
contingencies
of
a
roving
life
he
can
be
with
ease
a
cook
or
an
artificer
or
what
else
the
occasion
may
require
his
talents
for
actual
war
are
not
less
decided
either
in
advancing
with
spirit
or
in
retreating
with
order
the
frenchman
is
one
of
the
finest
soldiers
in
the
world
and
when
requisite
the
privates
in
their
army
often
exhibit
a
degree
of
intelligence
and
knowledge
of
the
profession
which
might
become
individuals
of
a
higher
rank
in
other
services
if
not
absolute
they
are
less
addicted
to
intoxication
than
the
english
soldier
who
perhaps
only
brings
to
counterbalance
the
numerous
advantages
on
the
part
of
his
opponent
that
perseverance
and
determination
in
combat
which
induces
him
to
repeat
maintain
and
prolong
his
efforts
under
every
disadvantage
of
numbers
and
circumstances
the
spirits
of
the
frenchman
such
as
we
have
described
did
not
suffer
much
from
the
violent
summons
which
tore
him
from
his
home
we
have
unhappily
in
our
own
navy
an
example
how
little
men
courage
is
broken
by
their
being
forced
into
a
dangerous
service
but
comfortless
as
the
state
of
france
then
was
and
painful
as
the
sights
must
have
been
by
which
the
eyes
were
daily
oppressed
closed
up
too
as
were
the
avenues
to
every
civil
walk
of
life
and
cheap
as
they
were
held
in
a
nation
which
had
become
all
one
vast
camp
a
youth
of
spirit
was
glad
to
escape
from
witnessing
the
desolation
at
home
and
to
take
with
gaiety
the
chance
of
death
or
promotion
in
the
only
line
which
might
now
be
accounted
comparatively
safe
and
indubitably
honourable
the
armies
with
whom
these
new
levies
were
incorporated
were
by
degrees
admirably
supplied
with
officers
the
breaking
down
the
old
distinctions
of
ranks
had
opened
a
free
career
to
those
desirous
of
promotion
and
in
times
of
hard
fighting
men
of
merit
are
distinguished
and
get
preferment
the
voice
of
the
soldier
had
often
its
influence
upon
the
preferment
and
that
is
a
vote
seldom
bestowed
but
from
ocular
proof
that
it
is
deserved
the
revolutionary
rulers
though
bloody
in
their
resentment
were
liberal
almost
extravagant
in
their
rewards
and
spared
neither
gold
nor
steel
honours
nor
denunciations
to
incite
their
generals
to
victory
or
warn
them
against
the
consequences
of
defeat
under
that
stern
rule
which
knew
no
excuse
for
ill
success
and
stimulated
by
opportunities
which
seemed
to
offer
every
prize
to
honourable
ambition
arose
a
race
of
generals
whom
the
world
scarce
ever
saw
equalled
and
of
whom
there
certainly
never
at
any
other
period
flourished
so
many
in
the
same
service
such
was
napoleon
buonaparte
himself
such
were
pichegru
and
moreau
doomed
to
suffer
a
gloomy
fate
under
his
ascendency
such
were
those
marshals
and
generals
who
were
to
share
his
better
fortunes
and
cluster
around
his
future
throne
as
the
paladins
around
that
of
charlemagne
or
as
the
british
and
armorican
champions

of

those
early
wars
and
summoned

by

eminence
and
fall
seemed
a
corollary
to
that
of
his
ney

bravest
of
the
brave

sagacious
macdonald
joubert
who
had
almost
anticipated
the
part
reserved
for
buonaparte
massena
the
spoiled
child
of
fortune
augereau
berthier
lannes
and
many
others
whose
names
began
already
to
stir
the
french
soldier
as
with
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
these
adventurers
in
the
race
of
fame
belonged
some
of
them
as
macdonald
to
the
old
military
school
some
like
moreau
came
from
the
civil
class
of
society
many
arose
from
origins
that
were
positively
mean
and
were
therefore
still
more
decidedly
children
of
the
revolution
but
that
great
earthquake
by
throwing
down
distinctions
of
birth
and
rank
had
removed
obstacles
which
would
otherwise
have
impeded
the
progress
of
almost
all
these
distinguished
men
and
they
were
therefore
for
the
greater
part
attached
to
that
new
order
of
affairs
which
afforded
full
scope
to
their
talents
sidenote
new
military
system
the
french
armies
thus
recruited
and
thus
commanded
were
disciplined
in
a
manner
suitable
to
the
materials
of
which
they
were
composed
there
was
neither
leisure
nor
opportunity
to
subject
the
new
levies
to
all
that
minuteness
of
training
which
was
required
by
the
somewhat
pedantic
formality
of
the
old
school
of
war
dumouriez
setting
the
example
began
to
show
that
the
principle
of
revolution
might
be
introduced
with
advantage
into
the
art
of
war
itself
and
that
the
difference
betwixt
these
new
conscripts
and
the
veteran
troops
to
whom
they
were
opposed
might
be
much
diminished
by
resorting
to
the
original
and
more
simple
rules
of
stratagie
and
neglecting
many
formalities
which
had
been
once
considered
as
essential
to
playing
the
great
game
of
war
with
success
it
is
the
constant
error
of
ordinary
minds
to
consider
matters
of
mere
routine
as
equally
important
with
those
which
are
essential
and
to
entertain
as
much
horror
at
a
disordered
uniform
as
at
a
confused
manœuvre
it
was
to
the
honour
of
the
french
generals
as
men
of
genius
that
in
the
hour
of
danger
they
were
able
to
surmount
all
the
prejudices
of
a
profession
which
has
its
pedantry
as
well
as
others
and
to
suit
the
discipline
which
they
retained
to
the
character
of
their
recruits
and
the
urgency
of
the
time
the
foppery
of
the
manual
exercise
was
laid
aside
and
it
was
restricted
to
the
few
motions
necessary
for
effectual
use
of
the
musket
and
bayonet
easier
and
more
simple
manœuvres
were
substituted
for
such
as
were
involved
and
difficult
to
execute
and
providing
the
line
or
column
could
be
formed
with
activity
and
that
order
was
preserved
on
the
march
the
mere
etiquette
of
military
movements
was
much
relaxed
the
quantity
of
light
troops
was
increased
greatly
beyond
the
number
which
had
of
late
been
used
by
european
nations
the
austrians
who
used
to
draw
from
the
tyrol
and
from
their
wild
croatian
frontier
the
best
light
troops
in
the
world
had
at
this
time
formed
many
of
them
into
regiments
of
the
line
and
thus
limited
and
diminished
their
own
superiority
in
a
species
of
force
which
was
becoming
of
greater
importance
daily
the
french
on
the
contrary
disciplined
immense
bodies
of
their
conscripts
as
irregulars
and
sharpshooters
their
numbers
and
galling
fire
frequently
prevented
their
more
systematic
and
formal
adversaries
from
being
able
to
push
forward
reconnoitring
parties
by
which
to
obtain
any
exact
information
as
to
the
numbers
and
disposition
of
the
french
while
the
republican
troops
of
the
line
protected
by
this
swarm
of
wasps
chose
their
time
place
and
manner
of
advancing
to
the
attack
or
retreating
as
the
case
demanded
it
is
true
that
this
service
cost
an
immense
number
of
lives
but
the
french
generals
were
sensible
that
human
life
was
the
commodity
which
the
republic
set
the
least
value
upon
and
that
when
death
was
served
with
so
wide
a
feast
from
one
end
of
france
to
the
other
he
was
not
to
be
stinted
in
his
own
proper
the
field
of
battle
the
same
circumstances
dictated
another
variety
or
innovation
in
french
tactics
which
greatly
increased
the
extent
of
slaughter
the
armies
with
whom
they
engaged
disconcerted
by
the
great
superiority
of
numbers
which
were
opposed
to
them
and
baffled
in
obtaining
intelligence
by
the
teazing
activity
of
the
french
light
troops
most
frequently
assumed
the
defensive
and
taking
a
strong
position
improved
perhaps
by
waited
until
the
fiery
youth
of
france
should
come
to
throw
themselves
by
thousands
upon
their
batteries
it
was
then
that
the
french
generals
began
first
to
employ
those
successive
attacks
in
column
in
which
one
brigade
of
troops
is
brought
up
after
another
without
interruption
and
without
regard
to
the
loss
of
lives
until
the
arms
of
the
defenders
are
weary
with
slaying
and
their
line
being
in
some
point
or
other
carried
through
the
impossibility
of
every
where
resisting
an
assault
so
continued
and
desperate
the
battle
is
lost
and
the
army
is
compelled
to
give
way
while
the
conquerors
can
by
the
multitudes
they
have
brought
into
action
afford
to
pay
the
dreadful
price
which
they
have
given
for
the
victory
in
this
manner
the
french
generals
employed
whole
columns
of
the
young
conscripts
termed
from
that
circumstance
food
for
the
cannon
à
before
disease
had
deprived
them
of
bodily
activity
or
experience
had
taught
them
the
dangers
of
the
profession
on
which
they
entered
with
the
thoughtless
vivacity
of
schoolboys
it
also
frequently
happened
even
when
the
french
possessed
no
numerical
superiority
upon
the
whole
that
by
the
celerity
of
their
movements
and
the
skill
with
which
they
at
once
combined
and
executed
them
they
were
able
suddenly
to
concentrate
such
a
superiority
upon
the
point
which
they
meant
to
attack
as
ensured
them
the
same
advantage
in
enumerating
the
causes
of
the
general
success
of
the
republican
arms
we
must
not
forget
the
moral
motive
the
interest
which
the
troops
took
in
the
cause
of
the
war
the
army
in
fact
derived
an
instant
and
most
flattering
advantage
from
the
revolution
which
could
scarce
be
said
of
any
other
class
of
men
in
france
excepting
the
peasant
their
pay
was
improved
their
importance
increased
there
was
not
a
private
soldier
against
whom
the
highest
ranks
of
the
profession
was
shut
and
many
attained
to
them
massena
was
originally
a
drummer
ney
a
common
hussar
and
there
were
many
others
who
arose
to
the
command
of
armies
from
the
lowest
condition
now
this
was
a
government
for
a
soldier
to
live
and
flourish
under
and
seemed
still
more
advantageous
when
contrasted
with
the
old
monarchical
system
in
which
the
prejudices
of
birth
interfered
at
every
turn
with
the
pretensions
of
merit
where
a
could
not
rise
above
a
subaltern
rank
and
where
all
offices
of
distinction
were
as
matters
of
inheritance
reserved
for
the
alone
but
besides
the
rewards
which
it
held
out
to
its
soldiers
the
service
of
the
republic
had
this
irresistible
charm
for
the
soldiery
it
was
victorious
the
conquests
which
they
obtained
and
the
plunder
which
attended
those
conquests
attached
the
victors
to
their
standards
and
drew
around
them
fresh
hosts
of
their
countrymen
la
republique
became
a
as
dear
to
their
army
as
in
former
times
the
shout
of
dennis
mountjoie
and
the
tricoloured
flag
supplied
the
place
of
the
oriflamme
by
the
confusion
the
oppression
the
bloodshed
of
the
revolution
the
soldiers
were
but
little
affected
they
heard
of
friends
imprisoned
or
guillotined
indeed
but
a
military
man
like
a
monk
leaves
the
concerns
of
the
civil
world
behind
him
and
while
he
plays
the
bloody
game
for
his
own
life
or
death
with
the
enemy
who
faces
him
has
little
time
to
think
of
what
is
happening
in
the
native
country
which
he
has
abandoned
for
any
other
acquaintance
with
the
politics
of
the
republic
they
were
indebted
to
flowery
speeches
in
the
convention
resounding
with
the
praises
of
the
troops
and
to
harangues
of
the
representatives
accompanying
the
armies
who
never
failed
by
flattery
and
largesses
to
retain
possession
of
the
affection
of
the
soldiers
whose
attachment
was
so
essential
to
their
safety
so
well
did
they
accomplish
this
that
while
the
republic
flourished
the
armies
were
so
much
attached
to
that
order
of
things
as
to
desert
successively
some
of
their
most
favourite
leaders
when
they
became
objects
of
suspicion
to
the
fierce
democracy
the
generals
indeed
had
frequent
and
practical
experience
that
the
republic
could
be
as
severe
with
her
military
as
with
her
civil
subjects
and
even
more
so
judging
by
the
ruthlessness
with
which
they
were
arrested
and
executed
with
scarce
the
shadow
of
a
pretext
yet
this
did
not
diminish
the
zeal
of
the
survivors
if
the
revolutionary
government
beheaded
they
also
paid
promised
and
promoted
and
amid
the
various
risks
of
a
soldier
life
the
hazard
of
the
guillotine
was
only
a
slight
addition
to
those
of
the
sword
and
the
musket
which
in
the
sanguine
eye
of
courage
and
ambition
joined
to
each
confidence
in
his
own
good
luck
did
not
seem
to
render
his
chance
much
worse
when
such
punishment
arrived
the
generals
submitted
to
it
as
one
of
the
casualties
of
war
nor
was
the
republic
worse
or
more
reluctantly
served
by
those
who
were
left
such
being
the
admirable
quality
and
talents
the
mode
of
thinking
and
acting
which
the
republican
or
rather
revolutionary
armies
possessed
it
required
only
the
ruling
genius
of
the
celebrated
carnot
who
bred
in
the
department
of
engineers
was
probably
one
of
the
very
best
tacticians
in
the
world
to
bring
them
into
effectual
use
he
was
a
member
of
the
frightful
committee
of
public
safety
but
it
has
been
said
in
his
defence
that
he
did
not
meddle
with
its
atrocities
limiting
himself
entirely
to
the
war
department
for
which
he
showed
so
much
talent
that
his
colleagues
left
it
to
his
exclusive
management
in
his
own
individual
person
he
constituted
the
whole
or
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
corresponded
with
and
directed
the
movements
of
the
armies
as
if
inspired
by
the
goddess
of
victory
herself
he
first
daringly
claimed
for
france
her
natural
boundaries
that
is
the
boundaries
most
convenient
for
her
the
rhine
the
alps
and
the
pyrenees
he
assigned
as
the
limits
of
her
dominions
and
asserted
that
all
within
these
belonging
to
other
powers
must
have
been
usurpations
on
france
and
were
unhesitatingly
to
be
resumed
as
such
and
he
conquered
by
his
genius
the
countries
which
his
ambition
claimed
belgium
became
an
integral
part
of
the
french
republic
holland
was
erected
into
a
little
dependent
democracy
as
an
outwork
for
defending
the
great
nation
the
austrians
were
foiled
on
the
rhine
the
king
of
sardinia
driven
from
savoy
and
schemes
realized
which
louis
xiv
never
dared
to
dream
of
in
return
for
the
complaisance
exhibited
by
the
committee
towards
himself
he
did
not
express
any
scruples
if
he
entertained
such
concerning
the
mode
in
which
they
governed
the
interior
of
their
unhappy
country
yet
notwithstanding
his
skill
and
his
caution
the
blighting
eye
of
robespierre
was
fixed
on
him
as
that
of
the
snake
which
watches
its
victim
he
could
not
dispense
with
the
talents
of
carnot
in
the
career
of
victory
but
it
is
well
known
that
if
his
plans
on
any
occasion
had
miscarried
the
security
of
his
head
would
have
become
very
precarious
it
must
also
be
allowed
that
although
the
french
armies
were
attached
to
the
republic
and
moved
usually
under
direction
of
a
member
of
the
committee
of
public
security
they
did
not
adopt
in
their
brutal
extent
the
orders
for
exterminating
warfare
which
were
transmitted
to
them
by
their
masters
at
one
time
a
decree
was
passed
refusing
quarter
to
such
of
the
allied
troops
as
might
be
made
prisoners
but
the
french
soldiers
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
take
a
step
which
must
have
aggravated
so
dreadfully
the
necessary
horrors
of
war
when
we
consider
how
the
civil
government
of
france
were
employed
when
the
soldiers
refused
their
sanction
to
this
decree
it
seems
as
if
humanity
had
fled
from
cities
and
the
peaceful
dwellings
of
men
to
seek
a
home
in
camps
and
combats
one
important
part
of
the
subject
can
be
here
treated
but
slightly
we
allude
to
the
great
advantages
derived
by
the
french
arms
from
the
reception
of
their
political
doctrines
at
this
period
among
the
people
whom
they
invaded
they
proclaimed
aloud
that
they
made
war
on
castles
and
palaces
but
were
at
peace
with
cottages
and
as
on
some
occasions
besieging
generals
are
said
to
have
bribed
the
governor
of
a
place
to
surrender
it
by
promising
they
would
leave
in
his
unchallenged
possession
the
military
chest
of
the
garrison
so
the
french
in
all
cases
held
out
to
the
populace
the
plunder
of
their
own
nobles
as
an
inducement
for
them
to
favour
at
least
not
to
oppose
the
invasion
of
their
country
thus
their
armies
were
always
preceded
by
their
principles
a
party
favourable
to
france
and
listening
with
delight
to
the
doctrines
of
liberty
and
equality
was
formed
in
the
bosom
of
each
neighbouring
state
so
that
the
power
of
the
invaded
nation
was
crushed
and
its
spirit
quenched
under
a
sense
of
internal
discontent
and
discord
the
french
were
often
received
at
once
as
conquerors
and
deliverers
by
the
countries
they
invaded
and
in
almost
all
cases
the
governments
on
which
they
made
war
were
obliged
to
trust
exclusively
to
such
regular
forces
as
they
could
bring
into
the
field
being
deprived
of
the
inappreciable
advantage
of
general
zeal
among
their
subjects
in
their
behalf
it
was
not
long
ere
the
inhabitants
of
those
deceived
countries
found
that
the
fruits
of
the
misnamed
tree
of
liberty
resembled
those
said
to
grow
by
the
dead
sea
fair
and
goodly
to
the
eye
but
to
the
taste
all
filth
and
bitterness
sidenote
retrospect
we
are
now
to
close
our
review
of
the
french
revolution
the
fall
of
robespierre
being
the
era
at
which
its
terrors
began
to
ebb
and
recede
nor
did
they
ever
again
rise
to
the
same
height
if
we
look
back
at
the
whole
progress
of
the
change
from
the
convocation
of
the
to
the
thermidor
as
the
era
of
that
man
overthrow
was
called
the
eye
in
vain
seeks
for
any
point
at
which
even
a
probability
existed
of
establishing
a
solid
or
permanent
government
the
three
successive
constitutions
of
and
the
successive
work
of
constitutionalists
girondists
and
jacobins
possessed
no
more
power
to
limit
or
arrest
the
force
of
the
revolutionary
impulse
than
a
bramble
or
brier
to
stop
the
progress
of
a
rock
rushing
down
from
a
precipice
though
ratified
and
sworn
to
with
every
circumstance
which
could
add
solemnity
to
the
obligation
each
remained
in
succession
a
dead
letter
france
in
and
was
therefore
a
nation
without
either
a
regular
constitution
or
a
regular
administration
governed
by
the
remnant
of
an
assembly
called
a
convention
who
continued
sitting
merely
because
the
crisis
found
them
in
possession
of
their
seats
and
who
administered
the
government
through
the
medium
of
provisional
committees
with
whose
dictates
they
complied
implicitly
and
who
really
directed
all
things
though
in
the
convention
name
in
the
meantime
and
since
those
strange
scenes
had
commenced
france
had
lost
her
king
and
nobles
her
church
and
clergy
her
judges
courts
and
magistrates
her
colonies
and
commerce
the
greater
part
of
her
statesmen
and
men
of
note
had
perished
by
proscription
and
her
eloquence
had
been
cut
short
by
the
guillotine
she
had
no
finances
the
bonds
of
civil
society
seem
to
have
retained
their
influence
from
habit
only
the
nation
possessed
only
one
powerful
engine
which
france
called
her
own
and
one
impulsive
power
to
guide
it
these
were
her
army
and
her
ambition
she
resembled
a
person
in
the
delirium
of
a
fever
who
has
stripped
himself
in
his
frenzy
of
all
decent
and
necessary
clothing
and
retains
in
his
hand
only
a
bloody
sword
while
those
who
have
endeavoured
to
check
his
fury
lie
subdued
around
him
never
had
so
many
great
events
successively
taken
place
in
a
nation
without
affording
something
like
a
fixed
or
determined
result
either
already
attained
or
soon
to
be
expected
again
and
again
did
reflecting
men
say
to
each
other
this
state
of
things
in
which
all
seems
to
be
temporary
and
revolutionary
will
not
can
not
last
and
especially
after
the
fall
of
robespierre
it
seemed
that
some
change
was
approaching
those
who
had
achieved
that
work
did
not
hold
on
any
terms
of
security
the
temporary
power
which
it
had
procured
them
they
rather
retained
their
influence
by
means
of
the
jealousy
of
two
extreme
parties
than
from
any
confidence
reposed
in
themselves
those
who
had
suffered
so
deeply
under
the
rule
of
the
revolutionary
government
must
have
looked
with
suspicion
on
the
thermidoriens
as
regular
jacobins
who
had
shared
all
the
excesses
of
the
period
of
terror
and
now
employed
their
power
in
protecting
the
perpetrators
on
the
other
hand
those
of
the
revolutionists
who
yet
continued
in
the
bond
of
jacobin
fraternity
could
not
forgive
tallien
and
barras
the
silencing
the
jacobin
clubs
the
exiling
collot
and
putting
to
death
many
other
patriots
and
totally
crushing
the
system
of
revolutionary
government
in
fact
if
the
thoroughbred
revolutionists
still
endured
the
domination
of
tallien
and
barras
it
was
only
because
it
shielded
them
from
the
reaction
or
retributive
measures
threatened
by
the
moderate
party
matters
it
was
thought
could
not
remain
in
this
uncertain
state
nor
was
the
present
temporary
pageant
of
government
likely
to
linger
long
on
the
scene
but
by
whom
was
that
scene
next
to
be
opened
would
a
late
returning
to
ancient
opinions
induce
a
people
who
had
suffered
so
much
through
innovation
to
recall
either
absolutely
or
upon
conditions
the
banished
race
of
her
ancient
princes
or
would
a
new
band
of
revolutionists
be
permitted
by
heaven
in
its
continued
vengeance
to
rush
upon
the
stage
would
the
supreme
power
become
the
prize
of
some
soldier
as
daring
as
cæsar
or
some
intriguing
statesman
as
artful
as
octavius
would
france
succumb
beneath
a
cromwell
or
a
monk
or
again
be
ruled
by
a
cabal
of
hackneyed
statesmen
or
an
institute
of
theoretical
philosophy
or
an
anarchical
club
of
jacobins
these
were
reflections
which
occupied
almost
all
bosoms
