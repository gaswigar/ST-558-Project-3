the
writings
of
john
burroughs
with
portraits
and
many
illustrations
volume
i
preface
to
first
edition
this
is
mainly
a
book
about
the
birds
or
more
properly
an
invitation
to
the
study
of
ornithology
and
the
purpose
of
the
author
will
be
carried
out
in
proportion
as
it
awakens
and
stimulates
the
interest
of
the
reader
in
this
branch
of
natural
history
though
written
less
in
the
spirit
of
exact
science
than
with
the
freedom
of
love
and
old
acquaintance
yet
i
have
in
no
instance
taken
liberties
with
facts
or
allowed
my
imagination
to
influence
me
to
the
extent
of
giving
a
false
impression
or
a
wrong
coloring
i
have
reaped
my
harvest
more
in
the
woods
than
in
the
study
what
i
offer
in
fact
is
a
careful
and
conscientious
record
of
actual
observations
and
experiences
and
is
true
as
it
stands
written
every
word
of
it
but
what
has
interested
me
most
in
ornithology
is
the
pursuit
the
chase
the
discovery
that
part
of
it
which
is
akin
to
hunting
fishing
and
wild
sports
and
which
i
could
carry
with
me
in
my
eye
and
ear
wherever
i
went
i
can
not
answer
with
much
confidence
the
poet
inquiry
hast
thou
named
all
the
birds
without
a
gun
but
i
have
done
what
i
could
to
bring
home
the
river
and
sky
with
the
sparrow
i
heard
singing
at
dawn
on
the
alder
bough
in
other
words
i
have
tried
to
present
a
live
bird
a
bird
in
the
woods
or
the
fields
with
the
atmosphere
and
associations
of
the
place
and
not
merely
a
stuffed
and
labeled
specimen
a
more
specific
title
for
the
volume
would
have
suited
me
better
but
not
being
able
to
satisfy
myself
in
this
direction
i
cast
about
for
a
word
thoroughly
in
the
atmosphere
and
spirit
of
the
book
which
i
hope
i
have
found
in
the
common
name
of
the
white
trillium
which
blooms
in
all
our
woods
and
which
marks
the
arrival
of
all
the

introduction
to

edition
in
coming
before
the
public
with
a
newly
made
edition
of
my
writings
what
can
i
say
to
my
reader
at
this
stage
of
our
acquaintance
that
will
lead
to
a
better
understanding
between
us
probably
nothing
we
understand
each
other
very
well
already
i
have
offered
myself
as
his
guide
to
certain
matters
out
of
doors
and
to
a
few
matters
indoor
and
he
has
accepted
me
upon
my
own
terms
and
has
on
the
whole
been
better
pleased
with
me
than
i
had
any
reason
to
expect
for
this
i
am
duly
grateful
why
say
more
yet
now
that
i
am
upon
my
feet
so
as
to
speak
and
palaver
is
the
order
i
will
keep
on
a
few
minutes
longer
it
is
now
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
since
my
first
book
was
published
i
have
lived
nearly
as
many
years
in
the
world
as
i
had
lived
when
i
wrote
its
principal
chapters
other
volumes
have
followed
and
still
others
when
asked
how
many
there
are
i
often
have
to
stop
and
count
them
up
i
suppose
the
mother
of
a
large
family
does
not
have
to
count
up
her
children
to
say
how
many
there
are
she
sees
their
faces
all
before
her
it
is
said
of
certain
savage
tribes
who
can
not
count
above
five
and
yet
who
own
flocks
and
herds
that
every
native
knows
when
he
has
got
all
his
own
cattle
not
by
counting
but
by
remembering
each
one
individually
the
savage
is
with
his
herds
daily
the
mother
has
the
love
of
her
children
constantly
in
her
heart
but
when
one
book
goes
forth
from
him
in
a
sense
it
never
returns
it
is
like
the
fruit
detached
from
the
bough
and
yet
to
sit
down
and
talk
of
one
books
as
a
father
might
talk
of
his
sons
who
had
left
his
roof
and
gone
forth
to
make
their
own
way
in
the
world
is
not
an
easy
matter
the
relation
to
his
book
is
a
little
more
direct
and
personal
after
all
more
a
matter
of
will
and
choice
than
a
father
relation
to
his
child
the
book
does
not
change
and
whatever
it
fortunes
it
remains
to
the
end
what
its
author
made
it
the
son
is
an
evolution
out
of
a
long
line
of
ancestry
and
one
responsibility
of
this
or
that
trait
is
often
very
slight
but
the
book
is
an
actual
transcript
of
his
mind
and
is
wise
or
foolish
according
as
he
made
it
so
hence
i
trust
my
reader
will
pardon
me
if
i
shrink
from
any
discussion
of
the
merits
or
demerits
of
these
intellectual
children
of
mine
or
indulge
in
any
very
confidential
remarks
with
regard
to
them
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
think
of
my
books
as
works
because
so
little
work
has
gone
to
the
making
of
them
it
has
all
been
play
i
have
gone
or
camping
or
canoeing
and
new
literary
material
has
been
the
result
my
corn
has
grown
while
i
loitered
or
slept
the
writing
of
the
book
was
only
a
second
and
finer
enjoyment
of
my
holiday
in
the
fields
or
woods
not
till
the
writing
did
it
really
seem
to
strike
in
and
become
part
of
me
a
friend
of
mine
now
an
old
man
who
spent
his
youth
in
the
woods
of
northern
ohio
and
who
has
written
many
books
says
i
never
thought
of
writing
a
book
till
my
and
then
only
to
reproduce
my
life
to
myself
the
writing
probably
cured
or
alleviated
a
sort
of
homesickness
such
is
a
great
measure
has
been
my
own
case
my
first
book
was
written
while
i
was
a
government
clerk
in
washington
it
enabled
me
to
live
over
again
the
days
i
had
passed
with
the
birds
and
in
the
scenes
of
my
youth
i
wrote
the
book
sitting
at
a
desk
in
front
of
an
iron
wall
i
was
the
keeper
of
a
vault
in
which
many
millions
of
were
stored
during
my
long
periods
of
leisure
i
took
refuge
in
my
pen
how
my
mind
reacted
from
the
iron
wall
in
front
of
me
and
sought
solace
in
memories
of
the
birds
and
of
summer
fields
and
woods
most
of
the
chapters
of
winter
sunshine
were
written
at
the
same
desk
the
sunshine
there
referred
to
is
of
a
richer
quality
than
is
found
in
new
york
or
new
england
since
i
left
washington
in
instead
of
an
iron
wall
in
front
of
my
desk
i
have
had
a
large
window
that
overlooks
the
hudson
and
the
wooded
heights
beyond
and
i
have
exchanged
the
vault
for
a
vineyard
probably
my
mind
reacted
more
vigorously
from
the
former
than
it
does
from
the
latter
the
vineyard
winds
its
tendrils
around
me
and
detains
me
and
its
loaded
trellises
are
more
pleasing
to
me
than
the
closets
of
greenbacks
the
only
time
there
is
a
suggestion
of
an
iron
wall
in
front
of
me
is
in
winter
when
ice
and
snow
have
blotted
out
the
landscape
and
i
find
that
it
is
in
this
season
that
my
mind
dwells
most
fondly
upon
my
favorite
themes
winter
drives
a
man
back
upon
himself
and
tests
his
powers
of
do
such
books
as
mine
give
a
wrong
impression
of
nature
and
lead
readers
to
expect
more
from
a
walk
or
a
camp
in
the
woods
than
they
usually
get
i
have
a
few
times
had
occasion
to
think
so
i
am
not
always
aware
myself
how
much
pleasure
i
have
had
in
a
walk
till
i
try
to
share
it
with
my
reader
the
heat
of
composition
brings
out
the
color
and
the
flavor
we
must
not
forget
the
illusions
of
all
art
if
my
reader
thinks
he
does
not
get
from
nature
what
i
get
from
her
let
me
remind
him
that
he
can
hardly
know
what
he
has
got
till
he
defines
it
to
himself
as
i
do
and
throws
about
it
the
witchery
of
words
literature
does
not
grow
wild
in
the
woods
every
artist
does
something
more
than
copy
nature
more
comes
out
in
his
account
than
goes
into
the
original
experience
most
persons
think
the
bee
gets
honey
from
the
flowers
but
she
does
not
honey
is
a
product
of
the
bee
it
is
the
nectar
of
the
flowers
with
the
bee
added
what
the
bee
gets
from
the
flower
is
sweet
water
this
she
puts
through
a
process
of
her
own
and
imparts
to
it
her
own
quality
she
reduces
the
water
and
adds
to
it
a
minute
drop
of
formic
acid
it
is
this
drop
of
herself
that
gives
the
delicious
sting
to
her
sweet
the
bee
is
therefore
the
type
of
the
true
poet
the
true
artist
her
product
always
reflects
her
environment
and
it
reflects
something
her
environment
knows
not
of
we
taste
the
clover
the
thyme
the
linden
the
sumac
and
we
also
taste
something
that
has
its
source
in
none
of
these
flowers
the
literary
naturalist
does
not
take
liberties
with
facts
facts
are
the
flora
upon
which
he
lives
the
more
and
the
fresher
the
facts
the
better
i
can
do
nothing
without
them
but
i
must
give
them
my
own
flavor
i
must
impart
to
them
a
quality
which
heightens
and
intensifies
them
to
interpret
nature
is
not
to
improve
upon
her
it
is
to
draw
her
out
it
is
to
have
an
emotional
intercourse
with
her
absorb
her
and
reproduce
her
tinged
with
the
colors
of
the
spirit
if
i
name
every
bird
i
see
in
my
walk
describe
its
color
and
ways
give
a
lot
of
facts
or
details
about
the
bird
it
is
doubtful
if
my
reader
is
interested
but
if
i
relate
the
bird
in
some
way
to
human
life
to
my
own
life
show
what
it
is
to
me
and
what
it
is
in
the
landscape
and
the
season
then
do
i
give
my
reader
a
live
bird
and
not
a
labeled
specimen
j
b
i
the
return
of
the
birds
spring
in
our
northern
climate
may
fairly
be
said
to
extend
from
the
middle
of
march
to
the
middle
of
june
at
least
the
vernal
tide
continues
to
rise
until
the
latter
date
and
it
is
not
till
after
the
summer
solstice
that
the
shoots
and
twigs
begin
to
harden
and
turn
to
wood
or
the
grass
to
lose
any
of
its
freshness
and
succulency
it
is
this
period
that
marks
the
return
of
the
birds
one
or
two
of
the
more
hardy
or
species
like
the
song
sparrow
and
the
bluebird
usually
arriving
in
march
while
the
rarer
and
more
brilliant
bring
up
the
procession
in
june
but
each
stage
of
the
advancing
season
gives
prominence
to
the
certain
species
as
to
certain
flowers
the
dandelion
tells
me
when
to
look
for
the
swallow
the
dogtooth
violet
when
to
expect
the
and
when
i
have
found
the
in
bloom
i
know
the
season
is
fairly
inaugurated
with
me
this
flower
is
associated
not
merely
with
the
awakening
of
robin
for
he
has
been
awake
for
some
weeks
but
with
the
universal
awakening
and
rehabilitation
of
nature
yet
the
coming
and
going
of
the
birds
is
more
or
less
a
mystery
and
a
surprise
we
go
out
in
the
morning
and
no
thrush
or
vireo
is
to
be
heard
we
go
out
again
and
every
tree
and
grove
is
musical
yet
again
and
all
is
silent
who
saw
them
come
who
saw
them
depart
this
pert
little
winter
wren
for
instance
darting
in
and
out
the
fence
diving
under
the
rubbish
here
and
coming
up
yards
away
how
does
he
manage
with
those
little
circular
wings
to
compass
degrees
and
zones
and
arrive
always
in
the
nick
of
time
last
august
i
saw
him
in
the
remotest
wilds
of
the
adirondacks
impatient
and
inquisitive
as
usual
a
few
weeks
later
on
the
potomac
i
was
greeted
by
the
same
hardy
little
busybody
does
he
travel
by
easy
stages
from
bush
to
bush
and
from
wood
to
wood
or
has
that
compact
little
body
force
and
courage
to
brave
the
night
and
the
upper
air
and
so
achieve
leagues
at
one
pull
and
yonder
bluebird
with
the
earth
tinge
on
his
breast
and
the
sky
tinge
on
his
back
did
he
come
down
out
of
the
heaven
on
that
bright
march
morning
when
he
told
us
so
softly
and
plaintively
that
if
we
pleased
spring
had
come
indeed
there
is
nothing
in
the
return
of
the
birds
more
curious
and
suggestive
than
in
the
first
appearance
or
rumors
of
the
appearance
of
this
little
the
bird
at
first
seems
a
mere
wandering
voice
in
the
air
one
hears
its
call
or
carol
on
some
bright
march
morning
but
is
uncertain
of
its
source
or
direction
it
falls
like
a
drop
of
rain
when
no
cloud
is
visible
one
looks
and
listens
but
to
no
purpose
the
weather
changes
perhaps
a
cold
snap
with
snow
comes
on
and
it
may
be
a
week
before
i
hear
the
not
again
and
this
time
or
the
next
perchance
see
this
bird
sitting
on
a
stake
in
the
fence
lifting
his
wing
as
he
calls
cheerily
to
his
mate
its
notes
now
become
daily
more
frequent
the
birds
multiply
and
flitting
from
point
to
point
call
and
warble
more
confidently
and
gleefully
their
boldness
increases
till
one
sees
them
hovering
with
a
saucy
inquiring
air
about
barns
and
peeping
into
and
stable
windows
inspecting
knotholes
and
intent
only
on
a
place
to
nest
they
wage
war
against
robins
and
wrens
pick
quarrels
with
swallows
and
seem
to
deliberate
for
days
over
the
policy
of
taking
forcible
possession
of
one
of
the
of
the
latter
but
as
the
season
advances
they
drift
more
into
the
background
schemes
of
conquest
which
they
at
first
seemed
bent
upon
are
abandoned
and
the
settle
down
very
quietly
in
their
old
quarters
in
remote
stumpy
fields
not
long
after
the
bluebird
comes
the
robin
sometimes
in
march
but
in
most
of
the
northern
states
april
is
the
month
of
the
robin
in
large
numbers
they
scour
the
fields
and
groves
you
hear
their
piping
in
the
meadow
in
the
pasture
on
the
hillside
walk
in
the
woods
and
the
dry
leaves
rustle
with
the
whir
of
their
wings
the
air
is
vocal
with
their
cheery
call
in
excess
of
joy
and
vivacity
they
run
leap
scream
chase
each
other
through
the
air
diving
and
sweeping
among
the
trees
with
perilous
rapidity
in
that
free
fascinating
and
pursuit
a
pursuit
which
still
lingers
in
many
parts
of
new
york
as
in
new
england
the
robin
is
one
constant
companion
when
the
day
is
sunny
and
the
ground
bare
you
meet
him
at
all
points
and
hear
him
at
all
hours
at
sunset
on
the
tops
of
the
tall
maples
with
look
heavenward
and
in
a
spirit
of
utter
abandonment
he
carols
his
simple
strain
and
sitting
thus
amid
the
stark
silent
trees
above
the
wet
cold
earth
with
the
chill
of
winter
still
in
the
air
there
is
no
fitter
or
sweeter
songster
in
the
whole
round
year
it
is
in
keeping
with
the
scene
and
the
occasion
how
round
and
genuine
the
notes
are
and
how
eagerly
our
ears
drink
them
in
the
first
utterance
and
the
spell
of
winter
is
thoroughly
broken
and
the
remembrance
of
it
afar
off
robin
is
one
of
the
most
native
and
democratic
of
our
birds
he
is
one
of
the
family
and
seems
much
nearer
to
us
than
those
rare
exotic
visitants
as
the
orchard
starling
or
grosbeak
with
their
distant
ways
hardy
noisy
frolicsome
neighborly
and
domestic
in
his
habits
strong
of
wing
and
bold
in
spirit
he
is
the
pioneer
of
the
thrush
family
and
well
worthy
of
the
finer
artists
whose
coming
he
heralds
and
in
a
measure
prepares
us
for
i
could
wish
robin
less
native
and
plebeian
in
one
respect
the
building
of
his
nest
its
coarse
material
and
rough
masonry
are
creditable
neither
to
his
skill
as
a
workman
nor
to
his
taste
as
an
artist
i
am
the
more
forcibly
reminded
of
his
deficiency
in
this
respect
from
observing
yonder
hummingbird
nest
which
is
a
marvel
of
fitness
and
adaptation
a
proper
setting
for
this
winged
gem
the
body
of
it
composed
of
a
white
substance
probably
the
down
of
some
plant
or
the
wool
of
some
worm
and
toned
down
in
keeping
with
the
branch
on
which
it
sits
by
minute
woven
together
by
threads
as
fine
and
grail
as
gossamer
from
robin
good
looks
and
musical
turn
we
might
reasonably
predict
a
domicile
of
him
as
clean
and
handsome
a
nest
as
the
whose
harsh
jingle
compared
with
robin
evening
melody
is
as
the
clatter
of
pots
and
kettles
beside
the
tone
of
a
flute
i
love
his
note
and
ways
better
even
than
those
of
the
orchard
starling
or
the
baltimore
oriole
yet
his
nest
compared
with
theirs
is
a
hut
contrasted
with
a
roman
villa
there
is
something
courtly
and
poetical
in
a
pensile
nest
next
to
a
castle
in
the
air
is
a
dwelling
suspended
to
the
slender
branch
of
a
tall
tree
swayed
and
rocked
forever
by
the
wind
why
need
wings
be
afraid
of
falling
why
build
only
where
boys
can
climb
after
all
we
must
set
it
down
to
the
account
of
democratic
turn
he
is
no
aristocrat
but
one
of
the
people
and
therefore
we
should
expect
stability
in
his
workmanship
rather
than
elegance
another
april
bird
which
makes
her
appearance
sometimes
earlier
and
sometimes
later
than
robin
and
whose
memory
i
fondly
cherish
is
the
the
pioneer
of
the
flycatchers
in
the
inland
farming
districts
i
used
to
notice
her
on
some
bright
morning
about
easter
day
proclaiming
her
arrival
with
much
variety
of
motion
and
attitude
from
the
peak
of
the
barn
or
as
yet
you
may
have
heard
only
the
plaintive
homesick
note
of
the
bluebird
or
the
faint
trill
of
the
song
sparrow
and
phoebe
clear
vivacious
assurance
of
her
veritable
bodily
presence
among
us
again
is
welcomed
by
all
ears
at
agreeable
intervals
in
her
lay
she
describes
a
circle
or
an
ellipse
in
the
air
ostensibly
prospecting
for
insects
but
really
i
suspect
as
an
artistic
flourish
thrown
in
to
make
up
in
some
way
for
the
deficiency
of
her
musical
performance
if
plainness
of
dress
indicates
powers
of
song
as
it
usually
does
then
phoebe
ought
to
be
unrivaled
in
musical
ability
for
surely
that
suit
is
the
superlative
of
plainness
and
that
form
likewise
would
hardly
pass
for
a
perfect
figure
of
a
bird
the
seasonableness
of
her
coming
however
and
her
civil
neighborly
ways
shall
make
up
for
all
deficiencies
in
song
and
plumage
after
a
few
weeks
phoebe
is
seldom
seen
except
as
she
darts
from
her
nest
beneath
some
bridge
or
shelving
cliff
another
april
comer
who
arrives
shortly
after
with
whom
he
associates
both
at
this
season
and
in
the
autumn
is
the
woodpecker
alias
alias
flicker
alias
yarup
he
is
an
old
favorite
of
my
boyhood
and
his
note
to
me
means
very
much
he
announces
his
arrival
by
a
long
loud
call
repeated
from
the
dry
branch
of
some
tree
or
a
stake
in
the
fence
a
thoroughly
melodious
april
sound
i
think
how
solomon
finished
that
beautiful
description
of
spring
and
the
voice
of
the
turtle
is
heard
in
the
land
and
see
that
a
description
of
spring
in
this
farming
country
to
be
equally
characteristic
should
culminate
in
like
manner
and
the
call
of
the
comes
up
from
the
wood
it
is
a
loud
strong
sonorous
call
and
does
not
seem
to
imply
an
answer
but
rather
to
subserve
some
purpose
of
love
or
music
it
is
yarup
proclamation
of
peace
and
to
all
on
looking
at
the
matter
closely
i
perceive
that
most
birds
not
denominated
songsters
have
in
the
spring
some
note
or
sound
or
call
that
hints
of
a
song
and
answers
imperfectly
the
end
of
beauty
and
art
as
a
livelier
iris
changes
on
the
burnished
dove
and
the
fancy
of
the
young
man
turns
lightly
to
thoughts
of
his
pretty
cousin
so
the
same
renewing
spirit
touches
the
silent
singers
and
they
are
no
longer
dumb
faintly
they
lisp
the
first
syllables
of
the
marvelous
tale
witness
the
clear
sweet
whistle
of
the
titmouse
the
soft
nasal
piping
of
the
nuthatch
the
amorous
vivacious
warble
of
the
bluebird
the
long
rich
note
of
the
meadowlark
the
whistle
of
the
quail
the
drumming
of
the
partridge
the
animation
and
loquacity
of
the
swallows
and
the
like
even
the
hen
has
a
homely
contented
carol
and
i
credit
the
owls
with
a
desire
to
fill
the
night
with
music
al
birds
are
incipient
or
would
be
songsters
in
the
spring
i
find
corroborative
evidence
of
this
even
in
the
crowing
of
the
cock
the
flowering
of
the
maple
is
not
so
obvious
as
that
of
the
magnolia
nevertheless
there
is
actual
inflorescence
few
writers
award
any
song
to
that
familiar
little
sparrow
the
socialis
yet
who
that
has
observed
him
sitting
by
the
wayside
and
repeating
with
devout
attitude
that
fine
sliding
chant
does
not
recognize
the
neglect
who
has
heard
the
snowbird
sing
yet
he
has
a
lisping
warble
very
savory
to
the
ear
i
have
heard
him
indulge
in
it
even
in
february
even
the
cow
bunting
feels
the
musical
tendency
and
aspires
to
its
expression
with
the
rest
perched
upon
the
topmost
branch
beside
his
mate
or
mates
for
he
is
quite
a
polygamist
and
usually
has
two
or
three
demure
little
ladies
in
faded
black
beside
him
generally
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
he
seems
literally
to
vomit
up
his
notes
apparently
with
much
labor
and
effort
they
gurgle
and
blubber
up
out
of
him
falling
on
the
ear
with
a
peculiar
subtile
ring
as
of
turning
water
from
a
glass
bottle
and
not
without
a
certain
pleasing
cadence
neither
is
the
common
woodpecker
entirely
insensible
to
the
wooing
of
the
spring
and
like
the
partridge
testifies
his
appreciation
of
melody
after
quite
a
primitive
fashion
passing
through
the
woods
on
some
clear
still
morning
in
march
while
the
metallic
ring
and
tension
of
winter
are
still
in
the
earth
and
air
the
silence
is
suddenly
broken
by
long
resonant
hammering
upon
a
dry
limb
or
stub
it
is
downy
beating
a
reveille
to
spring
in
the
utter
stillness
and
amid
the
rigid
forms
we
listen
with
pleasure
and
as
it
comes
to
my
ear
oftener
at
this
season
than
at
any
other
i
freely
exonerate
the
author
of
it
from
the
imputation
of
any
gastronomic
motives
and
credit
him
with
a
genuine
musical
performance
it
is
to
be
expected
therefore
that
will
respond
to
the
general
tendency
and
contribute
his
part
to
the
spring
chorus
his
april
call
is
his
finest
touch
his
most
musical
expression
i
recall
an
ancient
maple
standing
sentry
to
a
large
that
year
after
year
afforded
protection
to
a
brood
of
in
its
decayed
heart
a
week
or
two
before
nesting
seemed
actually
to
have
begun
three
or
four
of
these
birds
might
be
seen
on
almost
any
bright
morning
gamboling
and
courting
amid
its
decayed
branches
sometimes
you
would
hear
only
a
gentle
persuasive
cooing
or
a
quiet
confidential
chattering
then
that
long
loud
call
taken
up
by
first
one
then
another
as
they
sat
about
upon
the
naked
limbs
anon
a
sort
of
wild
rollicking
laughter
intermingled
with
various
cries
yelps
and
squeals
as
if
some
incident
had
excited
their
mirth
and
ridicule
whether
this
social
hilarity
and
boisterousness
is
in
celebration
of
the
pairing
or
mating
ceremony
or
whether
it
is
only
a
sort
of
annual
common
among
on
resuming
their
summer
quarters
is
a
question
upon
which
i
reserve
my
judgment
unlike
most
of
his
kinsmen
the
prefers
the
fields
and
the
borders
of
the
forest
to
the
deeper
seclusion
of
the
woods
and
hence
contrary
to
the
habit
of
his
tribe
obtains
most
of
his
subsistence
from
the
ground
probing
it
for
ants
and
crickets
he
is
not
quite
satisfied
with
being
a
woodpecker
he
courts
the
society
of
the
robin
and
the
finches
abandons
the
trees
for
the
meadow
and
feeds
eagerly
upon
berries
and
grain
what
may
be
the
final
upshot
of
this
course
of
living
is
a
question
worth
the
attention
of
darwin
will
his
taking
to
the
ground
and
his
pedestrian
feats
result
in
lengthening
his
legs
his
feeding
upon
berries
and
grains
subdue
his
tints
and
soften
his
voice
and
his
associating
with
robin
put
a
song
into
his
heart
indeed
what
would
be
more
interesting
than
the
history
of
our
birds
for
the
last
two
or
three
centuries
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
presence
of
man
has
exerted
a
very
marked
and
friendly
influence
upon
them
since
they
so
multiply
in
his
society
the
birds
of
california
it
is
said
were
mostly
silent
till
after
its
settlement
and
i
doubt
if
the
indians
heard
the
wood
thrush
as
we
hear
him
where
did
the
bobolink
disport
himself
before
there
were
meadows
in
the
north
and
rice
fields
in
the
south
was
he
the
same
lithe
beau
then
as
now
and
the
sparrow
the
lark
and
the
goldfinch
birds
that
seem
so
indigenous
to
the
open
fields
and
so
adverse
to
the
woods
we
can
not
conceive
of
their
existence
in
a
vast
wilderness
and
without
man
but
to
return
the
song
sparrow
that
universal
favorite
and
firstling
of
the
spring
comes
before
april
and
its
simple
strain
gladdens
all
hearts
may
is
the
month
of
the
swallows
and
the
orioles
there
are
many
other
distinguished
arrivals
indeed
nine
tenths
of
the
birds
are
here
by
the
last
week
in
may
yet
the
swallows
and
the
orioles
are
the
most
conspicuous
the
bright
plumage
of
the
latter
seems
really
like
an
arrival
from
the
tropics
i
see
them
dash
through
the
blossoming
trees
and
all
the
forenoon
hear
their
incessant
warbling
and
wooing
the
swallows
dive
and
chatter
about
the
barn
or
squeak
and
build
beneath
the
eaves
the
partridge
drums
in
the
fresh
sprouting
woods
the
long
tender
note
of
the
meadowlark
comes
up
from
the
meadow
and
at
sunset
from
every
marsh
and
pond
come
the
ten
thousand
voices
of
the
hylas
may
is
the
transition
month
and
exists
to
connect
april
and
june
the
root
with
the
flower
with
june
the
cup
is
full
our
hearts
are
satisfied
there
is
no
more
to
be
desired
the
perfection
of
the
season
among
other
things
has
brought
the
perfection
of
the
song
and
the
plumage
of
the
birds
the
master
artists
are
all
here
and
the
expectations
excited
by
the
robin
and
the
song
sparrow
are
fully
justified
the
thrushes
have
all
come
and
i
sit
down
upon
the
first
rock
with
hands
full
of
the
pink
azalea
to
listen
with
me
the
cuckoo
does
not
arrive
till
june
and
often
the
goldfinch
the
kingbird
the
scarlet
tanager
delay
their
coming
till
then
in
the
meadows
the
bobolink
is
in
all
his
glory
in
the
high
pastures
the
field
sparrow
sings
his
breezy
and
the
woods
are
unfolding
to
the
music
of
the
thrushes
the
cuckoo
is
one
of
the
most
solitary
birds
of
our
forests
and
is
strangely
tame
and
quiet
appearing
equally
untouched
by
joy
or
grief
fear
or
anger
something
remote
seems
ever
weighing
upon
his
mind
his
note
or
call
is
as
of
one
lost
or
wandering
and
to
the
farmer
is
prophetic
of
rain
amid
the
general
joy
and
the
sweet
assurance
of
things
i
love
to
listen
to
the
strange
clairvoyant
call
heard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
from
out
the
depths
of
the
forest
there
is
something
peculiarly
weird
and
monkish
about
it
wordsworth
lines
upon
the
european
species
apply
equally
well
to
ours
o
blithe
i
have
heard
i
hear
thee
and
rejoice
o
cuckoo
shall
i
call
thee
bird
or
but
a
wandering
voice
while
i
am
lying
on
the
grass
thy
loud
note
smites
my
ear
from
hill
to
hill
it
seems
to
pass
at
once
far
off
and
near
thrice
welcome
darling
of
the
spring
even
yet
thou
art
to
me
no
bird
but
an
invisible
thing
a
voice
a
mystery
the
is
the
only
species
found
in
my
locality
the
abounds
farther
south
their
note
or
call
is
nearly
the
same
the
former
sometimes
suggests
the
voice
of
a
turkey
the
call
of
the
latter
may
be
suggested
thus
kow
the
will
take
up
his
stand
in
a
tree
and
explore
its
branches
till
he
has
caught
every
worm
he
sits
on
a
twig
and
with
a
peculiar
swaying
movement
of
his
head
examines
the
surrounding
foliage
when
he
discovers
his
prey
he
leaps
upon
it
in
a
fluttering
manner
in
june
the
makes
a
tour
through
the
orchard
and
garden
regaling
himself
upon
the
at
this
time
he
is
one
of
the
tamest
of
birds
and
will
allow
you
to
approach
within
a
few
yards
of
him
i
have
even
come
within
a
few
feet
of
one
without
seeming
to
excite
his
fear
or
suspicion
he
is
quite
unsophisticated
or
else
royally
indifferent
the
plumage
of
the
cuckoo
is
a
rich
glossy
brown
and
is
unrivaled
in
beauty
by
any
other
neutral
tint
with
which
i
am
acquainted
it
is
also
remarkable
for
its
firmness
and
fineness
notwithstanding
the
disparity
in
size
and
color
the
species
has
certain
peculiarities
that
remind
one
of
the
passenger
pigeon
his
eye
with
its
red
circle
the
shape
of
his
head
and
his
motions
on
alighting
and
taking
flight
quickly
suggest
the
resemblance
though
in
grace
and
speed
when
on
the
wing
he
is
far
inferior
his
tail
seems
disproportionately
long
like
that
of
the
red
thrush
and
his
flight
among
the
trees
is
very
still
contrasting
strongly
with
the
honest
clatter
of
the
robin
or
pigeon
have
you
heard
the
song
of
the
field
sparrow
if
you
have
lived
in
a
pastoral
country
with
broad
upland
pastures
you
could
hardly
have
missed
him
wilson
i
believe
calls
him
the
grass
finch
and
was
evidently
unacquainted
with
his
powers
of
song
the
two
white
lateral
quills
in
his
tail
and
his
habit
of
running
and
skulking
a
few
yards
in
advance
of
you
as
you
walk
through
the
fields
are
sufficient
to
identify
him
not
in
meadows
or
orchards
but
in
high
breezy
will
you
look
for
him
his
song
is
most
noticeable
after
sundown
when
other
birds
are
silent
for
which
reason
he
has
been
aptly
called
the
vesper
sparrow
the
farmer
following
his
team
from
the
field
at
dusk
catches
his
sweetest
strain
his
song
is
not
so
brisk
and
varied
as
that
of
the
song
sparrow
being
softer
and
wilder
sweeter
and
more
plaintive
add
the
best
parts
of
the
lay
of
the
latter
to
the
sweet
vibrating
chant
of
the
wood
sparrow
and
you
have
the
evening
hymn
of
the
the
poet
of
the
plain
unadorned
pastures
go
to
those
broad
smooth
uplying
fields
where
the
cattle
and
sheep
are
grazing
and
sit
down
in
the
twilight
on
one
of
those
warm
clean
stones
and
listen
to
this
song
on
every
side
near
and
remote
from
out
the
short
grass
which
the
herds
are
cropping
the
strain
rises
two
or
three
long
silver
notes
of
peace
and
rest
ending
in
some
subdued
trills
and
quavers
constitute
each
separate
song
often
you
will
catch
only
one
or
two
of
the
bars
the
breeze
having
blown
the
minor
part
away
such
unambitious
quiet
unconscious
melody
it
is
one
of
the
most
characteristic
sounds
in
nature
the
grass
the
stones
the
stubble
the
furrow
the
quiet
herds
and
the
warm
twilight
among
the
hills
are
all
subtly
expressed
in
this
song
this
is
what
they
are
at
last
capable
of
the
female
builds
a
plain
nest
in
the
open
field
without
so
much
as
a
bush
or
thistle
or
tuft
of
grass
to
protect
it
or
mark
its
site
you
may
step
upon
it
or
the
cattle
may
tread
it
into
the
ground
but
the
danger
from
this
source
i
presume
the
bird
considers
less
than
that
from
another
skunks
and
foxes
have
a
very
impertinent
curiosity
as
finchie
well
knows
and
a
bank
or
hedge
or
a
rank
growth
of
grass
or
thistles
that
might
promise
protection
and
cover
to
mouse
or
bird
these
cunning
rogues
would
be
apt
to
explore
most
thoroughly
the
partridge
is
undoubtedly
acquainted
with
the
same
process
of
reasoning
for
like
the
she
too
nests
in
open
unprotected
places
avoiding
all
show
of
concealment
coming
from
the
tangled
and
almost
impenetrable
parts
of
the
forest
to
the
clean
open
woods
where
she
can
command
all
the
approaches
and
fly
with
equal
ease
in
any
direction
another
favorite
sparrow
but
little
noticed
is
the
wood
or
bush
sparrow
usually
called
by
the
ornithologists
spizella
pusilla
its
size
and
form
is
that
of
the
socialis
but
is
less
distinctly
marked
being
of
a
duller
redder
tinge
he
prefers
remote
bushy
heathery
fields
where
his
song
is
one
of
the
sweetest
to
be
heard
it
is
sometimes
very
noticeable
especially
early
in
spring
i
remember
sitting
one
bright
day
in
the
still
leafless
april
woods
when
one
of
these
birds
struck
up
a
few
rods
from
me
repeating
its
lay
at
short
intervals
for
nearly
an
hour
it
was
a
perfect
piece
of
and
was
of
course
all
the
more
noticeable
for
being
projected
upon
such
a
broad
unoccupied
page
of
silence
its
song
is
like
the
words
few
few
few
fee
fee
fee
uttered
at
first
high
and
leisurely
but
running
very
rapidly
toward
the
close
which
is
low
and
soft
still
keeping
among
the
unrecognized
the
vireo
or
flycatcher
deserves
particular
mention
the
song
of
this
bird
is
not
particularly
sweet
and
soft
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
little
hard
and
shrill
like
that
of
the
or
oriole
but
for
brightness
volubility
execution
and
power
of
imitation
he
is
unsurpassed
by
any
of
our
northern
birds
his
ordinary
note
is
forcible
and
emphatic
but
as
stated
not
especially
musical
he
seems
to
say
hiding
himself
in
the
low
dense
undergrowth
and
eluding
your
most
vigilant
search
as
if
playing
some
part
in
a
game
but
in
july
of
august
if
you
are
on
good
terms
with
the
sylvan
deities
you
may
listen
to
a
far
more
rare
and
artistic
performance
your
first
impression
will
be
that
that
cluster
of
azalea
or
that
clump
of
conceals
three
of
four
different
songsters
each
vying
with
the
the
others
to
lead
the
chorus
such
a
medley
of
notes
snatched
from
half
the
songsters
of
the
field
and
forest
and
uttered
with
the
utmost
clearness
and
rapidity
i
am
sure
you
can
not
hear
short
of
the
haunts
of
the
genuine
mockingbird
if
not
fully
and
accurately
repeated
there
are
at
least
suggested
the
notes
of
the
robin
wren
catbird
goldfinch
and
song
sparrow
the
pip
pip
of
the
last
is
produced
so
accurately
that
i
verily
believe
it
would
deceive
the
bird
herself
and
the
whole
uttered
in
such
rapid
succession
that
it
seems
as
if
the
movement
that
gives
the
concluding
note
of
one
strain
must
form
the
first
note
of
the
next
the
effect
is
very
rich
and
to
my
ear
entirely
unique
the
performer
is
very
careful
not
to
reveal
himself
in
the
mean
time
yet
there
is
a
conscious
air
about
the
strain
that
impresses
me
with
the
idea
that
my
presence
is
understood
and
my
attention
courted
a
tone
of
pride
and
glee
and
occasionally
of
bantering
jocoseness
is
discernible
i
believe
it
is
only
rarely
and
when
he
is
sure
of
his
audience
that
he
displays
his
parts
in
this
manner
you
are
to
look
for
him
not
in
tall
trees
or
deep
forests
but
in
low
dense
shrubbery
about
wet
places
where
there
are
plenty
of
gnats
and
mosquitoes
the
winter
wren
is
another
marvelous
songster
in
speaking
of
whom
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
superlatives
he
is
not
so
conscious
of
is
powers
and
so
ambitious
of
effect
as
the
flycatcher
yet
you
will
not
be
less
astonished
and
delighted
on
hearing
him
he
possesses
the
fluency
and
copiousness
for
which
the
wrens
are
noted
and
besides
these
qualities
and
what
is
rarely
found
conjoined
with
them
a
wild
sweet
rhythmical
cadence
that
holds
you
entranced
i
shall
not
soon
forget
that
perfect
june
day
when
loitering
in
a
low
ancient
hemlock
wood
in
whose
cathedral
aisles
the
coolness
and
freshness
seems
perennial
the
silence
was
suddenly
broken
by
a
strain
so
rapid
and
gushing
and
touched
with
such
a
wild
sylvan
plaintiveness
that
i
listened
in
amazement
and
so
shy
and
coy
was
the
little
minstrel
that
i
came
twice
to
the
woods
before
i
was
sure
to
whom
i
was
listening
in
summer
he
is
one
of
those
birds
of
the
deep
northern
forests
that
like
the
speckled
canada
warbler
and
the
hermit
thrush
only
the
privileged
ones
hear
the
distribution
of
plants
in
a
given
locality
is
not
more
marked
and
defined
than
that
of
the
birds
show
a
botanist
a
landscape
and
he
will
tell
you
where
to
look
for
the
the
columbine
or
the
harebell
on
the
same
principles
the
ornithologist
will
direct
you
where
to
look
for
the
greenlets
the
wood
sparrow
or
the
chewink
in
adjoining
counties
in
the
same
latitude
and
equally
inland
but
possessing
a
different
geological
formation
and
different
you
will
observe
quite
a
different
class
of
birds
in
a
land
of
the
beech
and
sugar
maple
i
do
not
find
the
same
songsters
that
i
know
where
thrive
the
oak
chestnut
and
laurel
in
going
from
a
district
of
the
old
red
sandstone
to
where
i
walk
upon
the
old
plutonic
rock
not
fifty
miles
distant
i
miss
in
the
woods
the
veery
the
hermit
thrush
the
warbler
the
warbler
the
warbler
the
black
and
yellow
warbler
and
many
others
and
find
in
their
stead
the
wood
thrush
the
chewink
the
redstart
the
the
flycatcher
the
flycatcher
the
quail
and
the
turtle
dove
in
my
neighborhood
here
in
the
highlands
the
distribution
is
very
marked
south
of
the
village
i
invariably
find
one
species
of
birds
north
of
it
another
in
only
one
locality
full
of
azalea
and
i
am
always
sure
of
finding
the
hooded
warbler
in
a
dense
undergrowth
of
and
alder
i
meet
the
warbler
in
a
remote
clearing
covered
with
heath
and
fern
with
here
and
there
a
chestnut
and
an
oak
i
go
to
hear
in
july
the
wood
sparrow
and
returning
by
a
stumpy
shallow
pond
i
am
sure
to
find
the
only
one
locality
within
my
range
seems
to
possess
attractions
for
all
comers
here
one
may
study
almost
the
entire
ornithology
of
the
state
it
is
a
rocky
piece
of
ground
long
ago
cleared
but
now
fast
relapsing
into
the
wildness
and
freedom
of
nature
and
marked
by
those
features
which
birds
and
boys
love
it
is
bounded
on
two
sides
by
the
village
and
highway
crossed
at
various
points
by
and
threaded
in
all
directions
by
paths
and
byways
along
which
soldiers
laborers
and
truant
are
passing
at
all
hours
of
the
day
it
is
so
far
escaping
from
the
axe
and
the
as
to
have
opened
communication
with
the
forest
and
mountain
beyond
by
straggling
lines
of
cedar
laurel
and
blackberry
the
ground
is
mainly
occupied
with
cedar
and
chestnut
with
an
undergrowth
in
many
place
of
heath
and
bramble
the
chief
feature
however
is
a
dense
growth
in
the
centre
consisting
of
dogwood
alder
hazel
with
a
network
of
smilax
and
a
little
zigzag
stream
the
draining
of
a
swam
beyond
which
passes
through
this
tanglewood
accounts
for
many
of
its
features
and
productions
if
not
for
its
entire
existence
birds
that
are
not
attracted
by
the
heath
or
the
cedar
and
chestnut
are
sure
to
find
some
excuse
for
visiting
this
miscellaneous
growth
in
the
centre
most
of
the
common
birds
literally
throng
in
this
and
i
have
met
here
many
of
the
rarer
species
such
as
the
flycatcher
the
solitary
warbler
the
swamp
warbler
the
warbler
the
fox
sparrow
etc
the
absence
of
all
birds
of
prey
and
the
great
number
of
flies
and
insects
both
the
result
of
the
proximity
to
the
village
are
considerations
which
ho
minstrel
passes
over
lightly
hence
the
popularity
of
the
resort
but
the
crowning
glory
of
all
these
robins
flycatchers
and
warblers
is
the
wood
thrush
more
abundant
than
all
other
birds
except
the
robin
and
catbird
he
greets
you
from
every
rock
and
shrub
shy
and
reserved
when
he
first
makes
his
appearance
in
may
before
the
end
of
june
he
is
tame
and
familiar
and
sings
on
the
tree
over
your
head
or
on
the
rock
a
few
paces
in
advance
a
pair
even
built
their
nest
and
reared
their
brood
within
ten
or
twelve
feet
of
the
piazza
of
a
large
in
the
vicinity
but
when
the
guests
commenced
to
arrive
and
the
piazza
to
be
thronged
with
gay
crowds
i
noticed
something
like
dread
and
foreboding
in
the
manner
of
the
mother
bird
and
from
her
still
quiet
ways
and
habit
of
sitting
long
and
silently
within
a
few
feet
of
the
precious
charge
it
seemed
as
if
the
dear
creature
had
resolved
if
possible
to
avoid
all
observation
if
we
take
the
quality
of
melody
as
the
test
the
wood
thrush
hermit
thrush
and
the
veery
thrush
stand
at
the
head
of
our
list
of
songsters
the
mockingbird
undoubtedly
possesses
the
greatest
range
of
mere
talent
the
most
varied
executive
ability
and
never
fails
to
surprise
and
delight
one
anew
at
each
hearing
but
being
mostly
an
imitator
he
never
approaches
the
serene
beauty
and
sublimity
of
the
hermit
thrush
the
word
that
best
expresses
my
feelings
on
hearing
the
mockingbird
is
admiration
though
the
first
emotion
is
one
of
surprise
and
incredulity
that
so
many
and
such
various
notes
should
proceed
from
one
throat
is
a
marvel
and
we
regard
the
performance
with
feelings
akin
to
those
we
experience
on
witnessing
the
astounding
feats
of
the
athlete
or
gymnast
and
this
notwithstanding
many
of
the
notes
imitated
have
all
the
freshness
and
sweetness
of
the
originals
the
emotions
excited
by
the
songs
of
these
thrushes
belong
to
a
higher
order
springing
as
they
do
from
our
deepest
sense
of
the
beauty
and
harmony
of
the
world
the
wood
thrush
is
worthy
of
all
and
more
than
all
the
praises
he
has
received
and
considering
the
number
of
his
appreciative
listeners
it
is
not
a
little
surprising
that
his
relative
and
equal
the
hermit
thrush
should
have
received
so
little
notice
both
the
great
ornithologists
wilson
and
audubon
are
lavish
in
their
praises
of
the
former
but
have
little
or
nothing
to
say
of
the
song
of
the
latter
audubon
says
it
is
sometimes
agreeable
but
evidently
has
never
heard
it
nuttall
i
am
glad
to
find
is
more
discriminating
and
does
the
bird
fuller
justice
it
is
quite
a
rare
bird
of
very
shy
and
secluded
habits
being
found
in
the
middle
and
eastern
states
during
the
period
of
song
only
in
the
deepest
and
most
remote
forests
usually
in
damp
and
swampy
localities
on
this
account
the
people
in
the
adirondack
region
call
it
the
swamp
angel
its
being
so
much
of
a
recluse
accounts
for
the
comparative
ignorance
that
prevails
in
regard
to
it
the
cast
of
its
song
is
very
much
like
that
of
the
wood
thrush
and
a
good
observer
might
easily
confound
the
two
but
hear
them
together
and
the
difference
is
quite
marked
the
song
of
the
hermit
is
in
a
higher
key
and
is
more
wild
and
ethereal
his
instrument
is
a
silver
horn
which
he
winds
in
the
most
solitary
places
the
song
of
the
wood
thrush
is
more
golden
and
leisurely
its
tone
comes
near
to
that
of
some
rare
stringed
instrument
one
feels
that
perhaps
the
wood
thrush
has
more
compass
and
power
if
he
would
only
let
himself
out
but
on
the
whole
he
comes
a
little
short
of
the
pure
serene
strain
of
the
hermit
yet
those
who
have
heard
only
the
wood
thrush
may
well
place
him
first
on
the
list
he
is
truly
a
royal
minstrel
and
considering
his
liberal
distribution
throughout
our
atlantic
seaboard
perhaps
contributes
more
than
any
other
bird
to
our
sylvan
melody
one
may
object
that
he
spends
a
little
too
much
time
in
tuning
his
instrument
yet
his
careless
and
uncertain
touches
reveal
its
rare
compass
and
power
he
is
the
only
songster
of
my
acquaintance
excepting
the
canary
that
displays
different
degrees
of
proficiency
in
the
exercise
of
his
musical
gifts
not
long
since
while
walking
one
sunday
in
the
edge
of
an
orchard
adjoining
a
wood
i
heard
one
that
so
obviously
and
unmistakably
surpassed
all
his
rivals
that
my
companion
although
slow
to
notice
such
things
remarked
it
wonderingly
and
with
one
accord
we
paused
to
listen
to
so
rare
a
performer
it
was
not
different
in
quality
so
much
as
in
quantity
such
a
flood
of
it
such
copiousness
such
long
trilling
accelerating
preludes
such
sudden
ecstatic
overtures
would
have
intoxicated
the
dullest
ear
he
was
really
without
a
compeer
a
master
artist
twice
afterward
i
was
conscious
of
having
heard
the
same
bird
the
wood
thrush
is
the
handsomest
species
of
this
family
in
grace
and
elegance
of
manner
he
has
no
equal
such
a
gentle
air
and
such
inimitable
ease
and
composure
in
his
flight
and
movement
he
is
a
poet
in
very
word
and
deed
his
carriage
is
music
to
the
eye
his
performance
of
the
commonest
act
as
catching
a
beetle
or
picking
a
worm
from
the
mud
pleases
like
a
stroke
of
wit
or
eloquence
was
he
a
prince
in
the
olden
time
and
do
the
regal
grace
and
mien
still
adhere
to
him
in
his
transformation
what
a
finely
proportioned
form
how
plain
yet
rich
his
color
the
bright
russet
of
his
back
the
clear
white
of
his
breast
with
the
distinct
spots
it
may
be
objected
to
robin
that
he
is
noisy
and
demonstrative
he
hurries
away
or
rises
to
a
branch
with
an
angry
note
and
flirts
his
wings
in
suspicion
the
mavis
or
red
thrush
sneaks
and
skulks
like
a
culprit
hiding
in
the
densest
alders
the
catbird
is
a
coquette
and
a
flirt
as
well
as
a
sort
of
female
paul
pry
and
the
chewink
shows
his
inhospitality
by
espying
your
movements
like
a
japanese
the
wood
thrush
has
none
of
theses
underbred
traits
he
regards
me
unsuspiciously
or
avoids
me
with
a
noble
reserve
or
if
i
am
quiet
and
incurious
graciously
hops
toward
me
as
if
to
pay
his
respects
or
to
make
my
acquaintance
i
have
passed
under
his
nest
within
a
few
feet
of
his
mate
and
brood
when
he
sat
near
by
on
a
branch
eying
me
sharply
but
without
opening
his
beak
but
the
moment
i
raised
my
hand
toward
his
defenseless
household
his
anger
and
indignation
were
beautiful
to
behold
what
a
noble
pride
he
has
late
one
october
after
his
mates
and
companions
had
long
since
gone
south
i
noticed
one
for
several
successive
days
in
the
dense
part
of
this
wood
flitting
noiselessly
about
very
grave
and
silent
as
if
doing
penance
for
some
violation
of
the
code
of
honor
by
many
gentle
indirect
approaches
i
perceived
that
part
of
his
were
undeveloped
the
sylvan
prince
could
not
think
of
returning
to
court
in
this
plight
and
so
amid
the
falling
leaves
and
cold
rains
of
autumn
was
patiently
biding
his
time
the
soft
mellow
flute
of
the
veery
fills
a
place
in
the
chorus
of
the
woods
that
the
song
of
the
vesper
sparrow
fills
in
the
chorus
of
the
fields
it
has
the
nightingale
habit
of
singing
in
the
twilight
as
indeed
have
all
our
thrushes
walk
out
toward
the
forest
in
the
warm
twilight
of
a
june
day
and
when
fifty
rods
distant
you
will
hear
their
soft
reverberating
notes
rising
from
a
dozen
different
throats
it
is
one
of
the
simplest
strains
to
be
heard
as
simple
as
the
curve
in
form
delighting
from
the
pure
element
of
harmony
and
beauty
it
contains
and
not
from
any
novel
or
fantastic
modulation
of
it
thus
contrasting
strongly
with
such
rollicking
hilarious
songsters
as
the
bobolink
in
whom
we
are
chiefly
pleased
with
tintinnabulation
the
verbal
and
labial
excellence
and
the
evident
conceit
and
delight
of
the
performer
i
hardly
know
whether
i
am
more
pleased
or
annoyed
with
the
catbird
perhaps
she
is
a
little
too
common
and
her
part
in
the
general
chorus
a
little
too
conspicuous
if
you
are
listening
for
the
note
of
another
bird
she
is
sure
to
be
prompted
to
the
most
loud
and
protracted
singing
drowning
all
other
sounds
if
you
sit
quietly
down
to
observe
a
favorite
or
study
a
her
curiosity
knows
no
bounds
and
you
are
scanned
and
ridiculed
from
every
point
of
observation
yet
i
would
not
miss
her
i
would
only
subordinate
her
a
little
make
her
less
conspicuous
she
is
the
parodist
of
the
woods
and
there
is
ever
a
mischievous
bantering
undertone
in
her
lay
as
if
she
were
conscious
of
mimicking
and
disconcerting
some
envied
songster
ambitious
of
song
practicing
and
rehearsing
in
private
she
yet
seems
the
least
sincere
and
genuine
of
the
sylvan
minstrels
as
if
she
had
taken
up
music
only
to
be
in
the
fashion
or
not
to
be
outdone
by
the
robins
and
thrushes
in
other
words
she
seems
to
sing
from
some
outward
motive
and
not
from
inward
joyousness
she
is
a
good
versifier
but
not
a
great
poet
vigorous
rapid
copious
not
without
fine
touches
but
destitute
of
any
high
serene
melody
her
performance
like
that
of
thoreau
squirrel
always
implies
a
spectator
there
is
a
certain
air
and
polish
about
her
strain
however
like
that
in
the
vivacious
conversation
of
a
lady
of
the
world
that
commands
respect
her
maternal
instinct
also
is
very
strong
and
that
simple
structure
of
dead
twigs
and
dry
grass
is
the
center
of
much
anxious
solicitude
not
long
since
while
strolling
through
the
woods
my
attention
was
attracted
to
a
small
densely
grown
swamp
hedged
in
with
eglantine
brambles
and
the
everlasting
smilax
from
which
proceeded
loud
cries
of
distress
and
alarm
indicating
that
some
terrible
calamity
was
threatening
my
minstrel
on
effecting
an
entrance
which
however
was
not
accomplished
till
i
had
doffed
coat
and
hat
so
as
to
diminish
the
surface
exposed
to
the
thorns
and
brambles
and
looking
around
me
from
a
square
yard
of
terra
firma
i
found
myself
the
spectator
of
a
loathsome
yet
fascinating
scene
three
or
four
yards
from
me
was
the
nest
beneath
which
in
long
festoons
rested
a
huge
black
snake
a
bird
two
thirds
grown
was
slowly
disappearing
between
his
expanded
jaws
as
he
seemed
unconscious
of
my
presence
i
quietly
observed
the
proceedings
by
slow
degrees
he
compassed
the
bird
about
with
his
elastic
mouth
his
head
flattened
his
neck
writhed
and
swelled
and
two
or
three
undulatory
movements
of
his
glistening
body
finished
the
work
then
he
cautiously
raised
himself
up
his
tongue
flaming
from
his
mouth
the
while
curved
over
the
nest
and
with
wavy
subtle
motions
explored
the
interior
i
can
conceive
of
nothing
more
overpoweringly
terrible
to
an
unsuspecting
family
of
birds
than
the
sudden
appearance
above
their
domicile
of
the
head
and
neck
of
this
it
is
enough
to
petrify
the
blood
in
their
veins
not
finding
the
object
of
his
search
he
came
streaming
down
from
the
nest
to
a
lower
limb
and
commenced
extending
his
researches
in
other
directions
sliding
stealthily
through
the
branches
bent
on
capturing
on
of
the
parent
birds
that
a
legless
wingless
creature
should
move
with
such
ease
and
rapidity
where
only
birds
and
squirrels
are
considered
at
home
lifting
himself
up
letting
himself
down
running
out
on
the
yielding
boughs
and
traversing
with
marvelous
celerity
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
the
thicket
was
truly
surprising
one
thinks
of
the
great
myth
of
the
tempter
and
the
cause
of
all
our
woe
and
wonders
if
the
arch
one
is
not
now
playing
off
some
of
his
pranks
before
him
whether
we
call
it
snake
or
devil
matters
little
i
could
but
admire
his
terrible
beauty
however
his
black
shining
folds
his
easy
gliding
movement
head
erect
eyes
glistening
tongue
playing
like
subtle
flame
and
the
invisible
means
of
his
almost
winged
locomotion
the
parent
birds
in
the
mean
while
kept
up
the
most
agonizing
cry
at
times
fluttering
furiously
about
their
pursuer
and
actually
laying
hold
of
his
tail
with
their
beaks
and
claws
on
being
thus
attacked
the
snake
would
suddenly
double
upon
himself
and
follow
his
won
body
back
thus
executing
a
strategic
movement
that
at
first
seemed
almost
to
paralyze
his
victim
and
place
her
within
his
grasp
not
quite
however
before
his
jaws
could
close
upon
the
coveted
prize
the
bird
would
tear
herself
away
and
apparently
faint
and
sobbing
retire
to
a
higher
branch
his
reputed
powers
of
fascination
availed
him
little
though
it
is
possible
that
a
frailer
and
less
combative
bird
might
have
been
held
by
the
fatal
spell
presently
as
he
came
gliding
down
the
slender
body
of
a
leaning
alder
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
slight
movement
of
my
arm
eyeing
me
an
instant
with
that
crouching
utter
motionless
gaze
which
i
believe
only
snakes
and
devils
can
assume
he
turned
quickly
a
feat
which
necessitated
something
like
crawling
over
his
own
body
and
glided
off
through
the
branches
evidently
recognizing
in
me
a
representative
of
the
ancient
parties
he
once
so
cunningly
ruined
a
few
moments
after
as
he
lay
carelessly
disposed
in
the
top
of
a
rank
alder
trying
to
look
as
much
like
a
crowded
branch
as
his
supple
shining
form
would
admit
the
old
vengeance
overtook
him
i
exercised
my
prerogative
and
a
missile
in
the
shape
of
a
stone
brought
him
looping
and
writhing
to
the
ground
after
i
had
completed
his
downfall
and
quiet
had
been
partially
restored
a
member
of
the
bereaved
household
came
out
from
his
and
jumping
upon
a
decayed
branch
chirped
vigorously
no
doubt
in
celebration
of
the
victory
till
the
middle
of
july
there
is
a
general
equilibrium
the
tide
stands
poised
the
holiday
spirit
is
unabated
but
as
the
harvest
ripens
beneath
the
long
hot
days
the
melody
gradually
ceases
the
young
are
out
of
the
nest
and
must
be
cared
for
and
the
moulting
season
is
at
hand
after
the
cricket
has
commenced
to
drone
his
monotonous
refrain
beneath
your
window
you
will
not
till
another
season
hear
the
wood
thrush
in
all
his
matchless
eloquence
the
bobolink
has
become
careworn
and
fretful
and
blurts
out
snatches
of
his
song
between
his
scolding
and
upbraiding
as
you
approach
the
vicinity
of
his
nest
oscillating
between
anxiety
for
his
brood
and
solicitude
for
his
musical
reputation
some
of
the
sparrows
still
sing
and
occasionally
across
the
hot
fields
from
a
tall
tree
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
comes
the
rich
note
of
the
scarlet
tanager
this
bird
loves
the
hottest
weather
and
i
hear
him
even
in
the
remainder
of
the
summer
is
the
carnival
of
the
swallows
and
flycatchers
flies
and
insects
to
any
amount
are
to
be
had
for
the
catching
and
the
opportunity
is
well
improved
see
that
sombre
pewee
on
yonder
branch
a
true
sportsman
he
who
never
takes
his
game
at
rest
but
always
on
the
wing
you
vagrant
fly
you
purblind
moth
beware
how
you
come
within
his
range
observe
his
attitude
the
curious
movement
of
his
head
his
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
glancing
from
heaven
to
earth
from
earth
to
heaven
his
sight
is
microscopic
and
his
aim
sure
quick
as
thought
he
has
seized
his
victim
and
is
back
to
his
perch
there
is
no
strife
no
pursuit
one
fell
swoop
and
the
matter
is
ended
that
little
sparrow
as
you
will
observe
is
less
skilled
it
is
the
socialis
and
he
finds
his
subsistence
properly
in
various
seeds
and
the
larvae
of
insects
though
he
occasionally
has
higher
aspirations
and
seeks
to
emulate
the
peewee
commencing
and
ending
his
career
as
a
flycatcher
by
an
awkward
chase
after
a
beetle
or
miller
he
is
hunting
around
in
the
dull
grass
now
i
suspect
with
the
desire
to
indulge
this
favorite
whim
there
the
opportunity
is
afforded
him
away
goes
a
little
in
the
most
tortuous
course
he
is
capable
of
and
away
goes
socialis
in
pursuit
the
contest
is
quite
comical
though
i
dare
say
it
is
serious
enough
to
the
moth
the
chase
continues
for
a
few
yards
when
there
is
a
sudden
rushing
to
cover
in
the
grass
then
a
taking
to
wing
again
when
the
search
has
become
to
close
and
the
moth
has
recovered
his
wind
socialis
chirps
angrily
and
is
determined
not
to
be
beaten
keeping
with
the
slightest
effort
upon
the
heels
of
the
fugitive
he
is
ever
on
the
point
of
halting
to
snap
him
up
but
never
quite
does
it
and
so
between
disappointment
and
expectation
is
soon
disgusted
and
returns
to
pursue
his
more
legitimate
means
of
subsistence
in
striking
contrast
to
this
strife
of
the
sparrow
and
the
moth
is
he
pigeon
hawk
pursuit
of
the
sparrow
or
the
goldfinch
it
is
a
race
of
surprising
speed
and
agility
it
is
a
test
of
wing
and
wind
every
muscle
is
taxed
and
every
nerve
strained
such
cries
of
terror
and
consternation
on
the
part
of
the
bird
tacking
to
the
right
and
left
and
making
the
most
desperate
efforts
to
escape
and
such
silent
determination
on
the
part
of
the
hawk
pressing
the
bird
so
closely
flashing
and
turning
and
timing
his
movements
with
those
of
the
pursued
as
accurately
and
as
inexorably
as
if
the
two
constituted
one
body
excite
feelings
of
the
deepest
concern
you
mount
the
fence
or
rush
out
of
your
way
to
see
the
issue
the
only
salvation
for
the
bird
is
to
adopt
the
tactics
of
the
moth
seeking
instantly
the
cover
of
some
tree
bush
or
hedge
where
its
smaller
size
enables
it
to
move
about
more
rapidly
these
pirates
are
aware
of
this
and
therefore
prefer
to
take
their
prey
by
one
fell
swoop
you
may
see
one
of
them
prowling
through
an
orchard
with
the
yellowbirds
hovering
about
him
crying
in
the
most
desponding
tone
yet
he
seems
not
to
regard
them
knowing
as
do
they
that
in
the
close
branches
they
are
as
safe
as
if
in
a
wall
of
adamant
august
is
the
month
of
the
hawks
the
is
the
most
noticeable
he
likes
the
haze
and
calm
of
these
long
warm
days
he
is
a
bird
of
leisure
and
seems
always
at
his
ease
how
beautiful
and
majestic
are
his
movements
so
and
easy
such
an
entire
absence
of
haste
such
a
magnificent
amplitude
of
circles
and
spirals
such
a
haughty
imperial
grace
and
occasionally
such
daring
aerial
evolutions
with
slow
leisurely
movement
rarely
vibrating
his
pinions
he
mounts
and
mounts
in
an
ascending
spiral
till
he
appears
a
mere
speck
against
the
summer
sky
then
if
the
mood
seizes
him
with
wings
half
closed
like
a
bent
bow
he
will
cleave
the
air
almost
perpendicularly
as
if
intent
on
dashing
himself
to
pieces
against
the
earth
but
on
nearing
the
ground
he
suddenly
mounts
again
on
broad
expanded
wing
as
if
rebounding
upon
the
air
and
sails
leisurely
away
it
is
the
sublimest
feat
of
the
season
one
holds
his
breath
till
he
sees
him
rise
again
if
inclined
to
a
more
gradual
and
less
precipitous
descent
he
fixes
his
eye
on
some
distant
point
in
the
earth
beneath
him
and
thither
bends
his
course
he
is
still
almost
meteoric
in
his
speed
and
boldness
you
see
his
path
down
the
heavens
straight
as
a
line
if
near
you
hear
the
rush
of
his
wings
his
shadow
hurtles
across
the
fields
and
in
an
instant
you
see
him
quietly
perched
upon
some
low
tree
or
decayed
stub
in
a
swamp
or
meadow
with
reminiscences
of
frogs
and
mice
stirring
in
his
maw
when
the
south
wind
blows
it
is
a
study
to
see
three
or
four
of
these
at
the
head
of
the
valley
far
up
toward
the
mountain
balancing
and
oscillating
upon
the
strong
current
now
quite
stationary
except
a
slight
tremulous
motion
like
the
poise
of
a
then
rising
and
falling
in
long
undulations
and
seeming
to
resign
themselves
passively
to
the
wind
or
again
sailing
high
and
level
far
above
the
mountain
peak
no
bluster
and
haste
but
as
stated
occasionally
a
terrible
earnestness
and
speed
fire
at
one
as
he
sails
overhead
and
unless
wounded
badly
he
will
not
change
his
course
or
gait
his
flight
is
a
perfect
picture
of
repose
in
motion
it
strikes
the
eye
as
more
surprising
than
the
flight
of
a
pigeon
and
swallow
even
in
that
the
effort
put
forth
is
so
uniform
and
delicate
as
to
escape
observation
giving
to
the
movement
an
air
of
buoyancy
and
perpetuity
the
effluence
of
power
rather
than
the
conscious
application
of
it
the
calmness
and
dignity
of
this
hawk
when
attacked
by
crows
or
the
kingbird
are
well
worth
of
him
he
seldom
deigns
to
notice
his
noisy
and
furious
antagonists
but
deliberately
wheels
about
in
that
aerial
spiral
and
mounts
and
mounts
till
his
pursuers
grow
dizzy
and
return
to
earth
again
it
is
quite
original
this
mode
of
getting
rid
of
an
unworthy
opponent
rising
to
the
heights
where
the
braggart
is
dazed
and
bewildered
and
loses
his
reckoning
i
am
not
sure
but
is
is
worthy
of
imitation
but
summer
wanes
and
autumn
approaches
the
songsters
of
the
are
silent
at
the
reaping
of
the
harvest
other
minstrels
take
up
the
strain
it
is
the
heyday
of
insect
life
the
day
is
canopied
with
musical
sound
all
the
songs
of
the
spring
and
summer
appear
to
be
floating
softened
and
refined
in
the
upper
air
the
birds
in
a
new
but
less
holiday
suit
turn
their
faces
southward
the
swallows
flock
and
go
the
bobolinks
flock
and
go
silently
and
unobserved
the
thrushes
go
autumn
arrives
bringing
finches
warblers
sparrows
and
kinglets
from
the
north
silently
the
procession
passes
yonder
hawk
sailing
peacefully
away
till
he
is
lost
in
the
horizon
is
a
symbol
of
the
closing
season
and
the
departing
birds
ii
in
the
hemlocks
most
people
receive
with
incredulity
a
statement
of
the
number
of
birds
that
annually
visit
our
climate
very
few
even
are
aware
of
half
the
number
that
spend
the
summer
in
their
own
immediate
vicinity
we
little
suspect
when
we
walk
in
the
woods
whose
privacy
we
are
intruding
upon
what
rare
and
elegant
visitants
from
mexico
from
central
and
south
america
and
from
the
islands
of
the
sea
are
holding
their
reunions
in
the
branches
over
our
heads
or
pursuing
their
pleasure
on
the
ground
before
us
i
recall
the
altogether
admirable
and
shining
family
which
thoreau
dreamed
he
saw
in
the
upper
chambers
of
spaulding
woods
which
spaulding
did
not
know
lived
there
and
which
were
not
put
out
when
spaulding
whistling
drove
his
team
through
their
lower
halls
they
did
not
go
into
society
in
the
village
they
were
quite
well
they
had
sons
and
daughters
they
neither
wove
nor
spun
there
was
a
sound
as
of
suppressed
hilarity
i
take
it
for
granted
that
the
forester
was
only
saying
a
pretty
thing
of
the
birds
though
i
have
observed
that
it
does
sometimes
annoy
them
when
spaulding
cart
rumbles
through
their
house
generally
however
they
are
as
unconscious
of
spaulding
as
spaulding
is
of
them
walking
the
other
day
in
an
old
hemlock
wood
i
counted
over
forty
varieties
of
these
summer
visitants
many
of
the
common
to
other
woods
in
the
vicinity
but
quite
a
number
peculiar
to
these
ancient
solitudes
and
not
a
few
that
are
rare
in
any
locality
it
is
quite
unusual
to
find
so
large
a
number
abiding
in
one
forest
and
that
not
a
large
one
most
of
them
nesting
and
spending
the
summer
there
many
of
those
i
observed
commonly
pass
this
season
much
farther
north
but
the
geographical
distribution
of
birds
is
rather
a
climatical
one
the
same
temperature
though
under
different
parallels
usually
attracts
the
same
birds
difference
in
altitude
being
equivalent
to
the
difference
in
latitude
a
given
height
above
under
the
parallel
of
thirty
degrees
may
have
the
same
climate
as
places
under
that
of
degrees
and
similar
flora
and
fauna
at
the
of
the
delaware
where
i
write
the
latitude
is
that
of
boston
but
the
region
has
a
much
greater
elevation
and
hence
a
climate
that
compares
better
with
the
northern
part
of
the
state
and
of
new
england
half
a
day
drive
to
the
southeast
brings
me
down
into
quite
a
different
temperature
with
an
older
geological
formation
different
forest
timber
and
different
birds
even
with
different
mammals
neither
the
little
gray
rabbit
nor
the
little
gray
fox
is
found
in
my
locality
but
the
great
northern
hare
and
the
red
fox
are
in
the
last
century
a
colony
of
beavers
dwelt
here
though
the
oldest
inhabitant
can
not
now
point
to
even
the
traditional
site
of
their
dams
the
ancient
hemlocks
whither
i
propose
to
take
the
reader
are
rich
in
many
things
besides
birds
indeed
their
wealth
in
this
respect
is
owing
mainly
no
doubt
to
their
rank
vegetable
growth
their
fruitful
swamps
and
their
dark
sheltered
retreats
their
history
is
of
an
heroic
cast
ravished
and
torn
by
the
tanner
in
his
thirst
for
bark
preyed
upon
by
the
lumberman
assaulted
and
beaten
back
by
the
settler
still
their
spirit
has
never
been
broken
their
energies
never
paralyzed
not
many
years
ago
a
public
highway
passed
through
them
but
it
was
at
no
time
a
tolerable
road
trees
fell
across
it
mud
and
limbs
choked
it
up
till
finally
travelers
took
the
hint
and
went
around
and
now
walking
along
its
deserted
course
i
see
only
the
footprints
of
coons
foxes
and
squirrels
nature
loves
such
woods
and
places
her
own
seal
upon
them
here
she
show
me
what
can
be
done
with
ferns
and
mosses
and
lichens
the
soil
is
marrowy
and
full
of
innumerable
forests
standing
in
these
fragrant
aisles
i
feel
the
strength
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
and
am
awed
by
the
deep
and
inscrutable
processes
of
life
going
on
so
silently
about
me
no
hostile
forms
with
axe
or
spud
now
visit
these
solitudes
the
cows
have
ways
through
them
and
know
where
the
best
browsing
is
to
be
had
in
spring
the
farmer
repairs
to
their
bordering
of
maples
to
make
sugar
in
july
and
august
women
and
boys
from
all
the
country
about
penetrate
the
old
barkpeelings
for
raspberries
and
blackberries
and
i
know
a
youth
who
wonderingly
follows
their
languid
stream
casting
for
trout
in
like
spirit
alert
and
buoyant
on
this
bright
june
morning
go
i
also
to
reap
my
harvest
pursuing
a
sweet
more
delectable
than
sugar
fruit
more
savory
than
berries
and
game
for
another
palate
than
that
tickled
by
trout
june
of
all
the
months
the
student
of
ornithology
can
least
afford
to
lose
most
birds
are
nesting
then
and
in
full
song
and
plumage
and
what
is
a
bird
without
its
song
do
we
not
wait
for
the
stranger
to
speak
it
seems
to
me
that
i
do
not
know
a
bird
till
i
have
heard
its
voice
then
i
come
nearer
it
at
once
and
it
possesses
a
human
interest
to
me
i
have
met
the
thrush
in
the
woods
and
held
him
in
my
hand
still
i
do
not
know
him
the
silence
of
the
throws
a
mystery
about
him
which
neither
his
good
looks
nor
his
petty
larcenies
in
cheery
time
can
dispel
a
bird
song
contains
a
clew
to
its
life
and
establishes
a
sympathy
an
understanding
between
itself
and
the
listener
i
descend
a
steep
hill
and
approach
the
hemlocks
through
a
large
when
twenty
rods
distant
i
hear
all
along
the
line
of
the
forest
the
incessant
warble
of
the
vireo
cheerful
and
happy
as
the
merry
whistle
of
a
schoolboy
he
is
one
of
our
most
common
and
widely
distributed
birds
approach
any
forest
at
any
hour
of
the
day
in
any
kind
of
weather
from
may
to
august
in
any
of
the
middle
or
eastern
districts
and
the
chances
are
that
the
first
note
you
hear
will
be
his
rain
or
shine
before
noon
or
after
in
the
deep
forest
or
in
the
village
grove
when
it
is
too
hot
for
the
thrushes
or
too
cold
and
windy
for
the
warblers
it
is
never
out
of
time
or
place
for
this
little
minstrel
to
indulge
his
cheerful
strain
in
the
deep
wilds
of
the
adirondacks
where
few
birds
are
seen
and
fewer
heard
his
note
was
almost
constantly
in
my
ear
always
busy
making
it
a
point
never
to
suspend
for
one
moment
his
occupation
to
indulge
his
musical
taste
his
lay
is
that
of
industry
and
contentment
there
is
nothing
plaintive
or
especially
musical
in
his
performance
but
the
sentiment
expressed
is
eminently
that
of
cheerfulness
indeed
the
songs
of
most
birds
have
some
human
significance
which
i
think
is
the
source
of
the
delight
we
take
in
them
the
song
of
the
bobolink
to
me
expresses
hilarity
the
song
sparrow
faith
the
bluebird
love
the
catbird
pride
the
flycatcher
that
of
the
hermit
thrush
spiritual
serenity
while
there
is
something
military
in
the
call
of
the
robin
the
is
classed
among
the
flycatchers
by
some
writers
but
is
much
more
of
a
and
has
few
of
the
traits
or
habits
of
the
muscicapa
or
the
true
sylvia
he
resembles
somewhat
the
warbling
vireo
and
the
two
birds
are
often
confounded
by
careless
observers
both
warble
in
the
same
cheerful
strain
but
the
latter
more
continuously
and
rapidly
the
is
a
larger
slimmer
bird
with
a
faint
bluish
crown
and
a
light
line
over
the
eye
his
movements
are
peculiar
you
may
see
him
hopping
among
the
limbs
exploring
then
under
side
of
the
leaves
peering
to
the
right
and
left
now
flitting
a
few
feet
now
hopping
as
many
and
warbling
incessantly
occasionally
in
a
subdued
tone
which
sounds
from
a
very
indefinite
distance
when
he
has
found
a
worm
to
his
liking
he
turns
lengthwise
of
the
limb
and
and
bruises
its
head
with
his
beak
before
devouring
it
as
i
enter
the
woods
the
snowbird
starts
up
before
me
and
chirps
sharply
his
protest
when
thus
disturbed
is
almost
metallic
in
its
sharpness
he
breeds
here
and
is
not
esteemed
a
snowbird
at
all
as
he
disappears
at
the
near
approach
of
winter
and
returns
again
in
spring
like
the
song
sparrow
and
is
not
in
any
way
associated
with
the
cold
and
snow
so
different
are
the
habits
of
birds
in
different
localities
even
the
crow
does
not
winter
here
and
is
seldom
seen
after
december
or
before
march
the
snowbird
or
black
as
it
is
known
among
the
farmers
is
the
finest
architect
of
any
of
the
known
to
me
the
site
of
its
nest
is
usually
some
low
bank
by
the
roadside
near
a
wood
in
a
slight
excavation
with
a
partially
concealed
entrance
the
exquisite
structure
is
placed
horse
and
cow
hair
are
plentifully
used
imparting
to
the
interior
of
the
nest
great
symmetry
and
firmness
as
well
as
softness
passing
down
through
the
maple
arches
barely
pausing
to
observe
the
antics
of
a
trio
of
squirrels
two
gray
ones
and
a
black
one
i
cross
an
ancient
brush
fence
and
am
fairly
within
the
old
hemlocks
and
in
one
of
the
most
primitive
undisturbed
nooks
in
the
deep
moss
i
tread
as
with
muffled
feet
and
the
pupils
of
my
eyes
dilate
in
the
dim
almost
religious
light
the
irreverent
red
squirrels
however
run
and
snicker
at
my
approach
or
mock
the
solitude
with
their
ridiculous
chattering
and
frisking
this
nook
is
the
chosen
haunt
of
the
winter
wren
this
is
the
only
place
and
these
the
only
woods
in
which
i
find
him
in
this
vicinity
his
voice
fills
these
dim
aisles
as
if
aided
by
some
marvelous
indeed
his
song
is
very
strong
for
so
small
a
bird
and
unites
in
a
remarkable
degree
brilliancy
and
plaintiveness
i
think
of
a
tremulous
vibrating
tongue
of
silver
you
may
know
it
is
the
song
of
a
wren
from
its
gushing
lyrical
character
but
you
must
needs
look
sharp
to
see
the
little
minstrel
especially
while
in
the
act
of
singing
he
is
nearly
the
color
of
the
ground
and
the
leaves
he
never
ascends
the
tall
trees
but
keeps
low
flitting
from
stump
to
stump
and
from
root
to
root
dodging
in
and
out
of
his
and
watching
all
intruders
with
a
suspicious
eye
he
has
a
very
pert
almost
comical
look
his
tail
stands
more
that
perpendicular
it
points
straight
toward
his
head
he
is
the
least
ostentatious
singer
i
know
of
he
does
not
strike
an
attitude
and
lift
up
his
head
in
preparation
and
as
it
were
clear
his
throat
but
sits
there
on
a
log
and
pours
out
his
music
looking
straight
before
him
or
even
down
at
the
ground
as
a
songster
he
has
but
few
superiors
i
do
not
hear
him
after
the
first
week
in
july
while
sitting
on
this
log
tasting
the
pungent
acidulous
the
blossoms
of
which
large
and
rise
everywhere
above
the
moss
a
bird
flies
quickly
past
and
alighting
on
a
low
limb
a
few
rods
off
salutes
me
with
whew
whew
or
whoit
whoit
almost
as
you
would
whistle
for
your
dog
i
see
by
his
impulsive
graceful
movement
and
his
dimly
speckled
breast
that
it
is
a
thrush
presently
he
utters
a
few
soft
mellow
notes
one
of
the
most
simple
expressions
of
melody
to
be
heard
and
scuds
away
and
i
see
it
is
the
veery
or
wilson
thrush
he
is
the
least
of
the
thrushes
in
size
being
about
that
of
the
common
bluebird
and
he
may
be
distinguished
from
his
relatives
by
the
dimness
of
the
spots
upon
his
breast
the
wood
thrush
has
very
clear
distinct
oval
spots
on
a
white
ground
in
the
hermit
the
spots
run
more
into
lines
on
a
ground
of
a
faint
bluish
white
in
the
veery
the
marks
are
almost
obsolete
and
a
few
rods
off
his
breast
presents
only
a
dull
yellowish
appearance
to
get
a
good
view
of
him
you
have
only
to
sit
down
in
his
haunts
as
in
such
cases
he
seems
equally
anxious
to
get
a
good
view
of
you
from
those
tall
hemlocks
proceeds
a
very
fine
warble
and
occasionally
i
see
a
spray
tremble
or
catch
the
flit
of
a
wing
i
watch
and
watch
till
my
head
grows
dizzy
and
my
neck
is
in
danger
of
permanent
displacement
and
still
do
not
get
a
good
view
presently
the
bird
darts
or
as
it
seems
falls
down
a
few
feet
in
pursuit
of
a
fly
or
a
moth
and
i
see
the
whole
of
it
but
in
the
dim
light
am
undecided
it
is
for
such
emergencies
that
i
have
brought
my
gun
a
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
half
a
dozen
in
the
bush
even
for
ornithological
purposes
and
no
sure
and
can
be
made
in
the
study
without
taking
life
without
procuring
specimens
this
bird
is
a
warbler
plainly
enough
from
his
habits
and
manner
but
what
kind
of
warbler
look
on
him
and
name
him
a
deep
orange
or
throat
and
breast
the
same
color
showing
also
in
a
line
over
the
eye
and
in
his
crown
back
variegated
black
and
white
the
female
is
less
marked
and
brilliant
the
warbler
would
seem
to
be
his
right
name
his
characteristic
cognomen
but
no
he
is
doomed
to
wear
the
name
of
some
discoverer
perhaps
the
first
who
rifled
his
nest
or
robbed
him
of
his
mate
blackburn
hence
blackburnian
warbler
the
burn
seems
appropriate
enough
for
in
these
dark
evergreens
his
throat
and
breast
show
like
flame
he
has
a
very
fine
warble
suggesting
that
of
the
redstart
but
not
especially
musical
i
find
him
in
not
other
woods
in
this
vicinity
i
am
attracted
by
another
warble
in
the
same
locality
and
experience
a
like
difficulty
in
getting
a
good
view
of
the
author
of
it
it
is
quite
a
noticeable
strain
sharp
and
sibilant
and
sounds
well
amid
the
the
old
trees
in
the
upland
woods
of
beech
and
maple
it
is
a
more
familiar
sound
than
in
these
solitudes
on
taking
the
bird
in
hand
one
can
not
help
exclaiming
how
beautiful
so
tiny
and
elegant
the
smallest
of
the
warblers
a
delicate
blue
back
with
a
slight
triangular
spot
between
the
shoulders
upper
mandible
black
lower
mandible
yellow
as
gold
throat
yellow
becoming
a
dark
bronze
on
the
breast
blue
he
is
called
though
the
yellow
is
much
nearer
a
bronze
he
is
remarkably
delicate
and
beautiful
the
handsomest
as
he
is
the
smallest
of
the
warblers
known
to
me
it
is
never
without
surprise
that
i
find
amid
these
rugged
savage
aspects
of
nature
creatures
so
fairy
and
delicate
but
such
is
the
law
go
to
the
sea
or
climb
the
mountain
and
with
the
ruggedest
and
the
savagest
you
will
find
likewise
the
fairest
and
the
most
delicate
the
greatness
and
the
minuteness
of
nature
pass
all
understanding
ever
since
i
entered
the
woods
even
while
listening
to
the
lesser
songsters
or
contemplating
the
silent
forms
about
me
a
strain
has
reached
my
ears
from
out
of
the
depths
of
the
forest
that
to
me
is
the
finest
sound
in
nature
the
song
of
the
hermit
thrush
i
often
hear
him
thus
a
long
way
off
sometimes
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
when
only
the
stronger
and
more
perfect
parts
of
his
music
reach
me
and
through
the
general
chorus
of
wrens
and
warblers
i
detect
this
sound
rising
pure
and
serene
as
if
a
spirit
from
some
remote
height
were
slowly
chanting
a
divine
accompaniment
this
song
appeals
to
the
sentiment
of
the
beautiful
in
me
and
suggests
a
serene
religious
beatitude
as
no
other
sound
in
nature
does
it
is
perhaps
more
of
an
evening
than
a
morning
hymn
though
i
hear
it
at
all
hours
of
the
day
it
is
very
simple
and
i
can
hardly
tell
the
secret
of
its
charm
o
spheral
spheral
he
seems
to
say
o
holy
holy
o
clear
away
clear
away
o
clear
up
clear
up
interspersed
with
the
finest
trills
and
the
most
delicate
preludes
it
is
not
a
proud
gorgeous
strain
like
the
tanager
or
the
grosbeak
suggests
no
passion
or
emotion
nothing
personal
but
seems
to
be
the
voice
of
that
calm
sweet
solemnity
one
attains
to
in
his
best
moments
it
realizes
a
peace
and
a
deep
solemn
joy
that
only
the
finest
souls
may
know
a
few
nights
ago
i
ascended
a
mountain
to
see
the
world
by
moonlight
and
when
near
the
summit
the
hermit
commenced
his
evening
hymn
a
few
rods
from
me
listening
to
this
strain
on
the
lone
mountain
with
the
full
moon
just
rounded
from
the
horizon
the
pomp
of
your
cities
and
the
pride
of
your
civilization
seemed
trivial
and
cheap
i
have
seldom
known
two
of
these
birds
to
be
singing
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
locality
rivaling
each
other
like
the
wood
thrush
or
the
veery
shooting
one
from
a
tree
i
have
observed
another
take
up
the
strain
from
almost
the
identical
perch
in
less
than
ten
minutes
afterward
later
in
the
day
when
i
had
penetrated
the
heart
of
the
old
barkpeeling
i
came
suddenly
upon
one
singing
from
a
low
stump
and
for
a
wonder
he
did
not
seem
alarmed
but
lifted
up
his
divine
voice
as
if
his
privacy
was
undisturbed
i
open
his
beak
and
find
the
inside
yellow
as
gold
i
was
prepared
to
find
it
inlaid
with
pearls
and
diamonds
or
to
see
an
angel
issue
from
it
he
is
not
much
in
the
books
indeed
i
am
acquainted
with
scarcely
any
writer
on
ornithology
whose
head
is
not
muddled
on
the
subject
of
our
three
prevailing
confounding
either
their
figures
or
their
songs
a
writer
in
the
atlantic
footnote
for
december
gravely
tells
us
the
wood
thrush
is
sometimes
called
the
hermit
and
then
after
describing
the
song
of
the
hermit
with
great
beauty
and
correctness
cooly
ascribes
it
to
the
veery
the
new
cyclopaedia
fresh
from
the
study
of
audubon
says
the
hermit
song
consists
of
a
single
plaintive
note
and
that
the
veery
resembles
that
of
the
wood
thrush
the
hermit
thrush
may
be
easily
identified
by
his
color
his
back
being
a
clear
becoming
rufous
on
his
rum
and
tail
a
quill
from
his
wing
placed
beside
one
from
his
tail
on
a
dark
ground
presents
quite
a
marked
contrast
i
walk
along
the
old
road
and
note
the
tracks
in
the
thin
layer
of
mud
when
do
these
creatures
travel
here
i
have
never
yet
chanced
to
meet
one
here
a
partridge
has
set
its
foot
there
a
woodcock
here
a
squirrel
or
mink
thee
a
skunk
there
a
fox
what
a
clear
nervous
track
reynard
makes
how
easy
to
distinguish
it
from
that
of
a
little
dog
it
is
so
sharply
cut
and
defined
a
dog
track
is
coarse
and
clumsy
beside
it
there
is
as
much
wildness
in
the
track
of
an
animal
as
in
its
voice
is
a
deer
track
like
a
sheep
or
a
goat
what
fleetness
and
agility
may
be
inferred
from
the
sharp
braided
track
of
the
gray
squirrel
upon
the
new
snow
ah
in
nature
is
the
best
discipline
how
sharpens
the
senses
giving
a
new
power
to
the
eye
the
ear
the
nose
and
are
not
the
rarest
and
most
exquisite
songsters
everywhere
in
these
solitudes
i
am
greeted
with
the
pensive
almost
pathetic
not
of
the
wood
pewee
the
pewees
are
the
true
flycatchers
and
are
easily
identified
they
are
very
characteristic
birds
have
strong
family
traits
and
pugnacious
dispositions
they
are
the
least
attractive
or
elegant
birds
of
our
fields
or
forests
of
no
particular
color
of
little
elegance
in
flight
or
movement
with
a
disagreeable
flirt
of
the
tail
always
quarreling
with
their
neighbors
and
with
one
another
no
birds
are
so
little
calculated
to
excite
pleasurable
emotions
in
the
beholder
or
to
become
objects
of
human
interest
and
affection
the
kingbird
is
the
best
dressed
member
of
the
family
but
he
is
a
braggart
and
though
always
snubbing
his
neighbors
is
an
arrant
coward
and
shows
the
white
feather
at
the
slightest
display
of
pluck
in
his
antagonist
i
have
seen
him
turn
tail
to
a
swallow
and
have
known
the
little
pewee
in
question
to
whip
him
beautifully
from
the
to
the
little
green
flycatcher
their
ways
and
general
habits
are
the
same
slow
in
flying
from
point
to
point
they
yet
have
a
wonderful
quickness
and
snap
up
the
fleetest
insects
with
little
apparent
effort
there
is
a
constant
play
of
quick
nervous
movements
underneath
their
outer
show
of
calmness
and
stolidity
they
do
not
scour
the
limbs
and
trees
like
the
warblers
but
perched
upon
the
middle
branches
wait
like
true
hunters
for
the
game
to
come
along
there
is
often
a
very
audible
snap
of
the
beak
as
they
seize
their
prey
the
wood
pewee
the
prevailing
species
in
this
locality
arrests
your
attention
by
his
sweet
pathetic
cry
there
is
room
for
it
also
in
the
deep
woods
as
well
as
for
the
more
prolonged
and
elevated
strains
its
relative
the
builds
an
exquisite
nest
of
moss
on
the
side
of
some
shelving
cliff
or
overhanging
rock
the
other
day
passing
by
a
ledge
near
the
top
of
a
mountain
in
a
singularly
desolate
locality
my
eye
rested
upon
one
of
these
structures
looking
precisely
as
if
it
grew
there
so
in
keeping
was
it
with
the
mossy
character
of
the
rock
and
i
have
had
a
growing
affection
for
the
bird
ever
since
the
rock
seemed
to
love
the
nest
and
claim
it
as
its
own
i
said
what
a
lesson
in
architecture
is
here
here
is
a
house
that
was
built
but
with
such
loving
care
and
such
beautiful
adaptation
of
the
means
to
the
end
that
it
looks
like
a
product
of
nature
the
same
wise
economy
is
noticeable
in
the
nests
of
all
birds
no
bird
could
paint
its
house
white
or
red
or
add
aught
for
show
at
one
point
in
the
grayest
most
shaggy
part
of
the
woods
i
come
suddenly
upon
a
brood
of
screech
owls
full
grown
sitting
together
upon
a
dry
limb
but
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
i
pause
within
four
or
five
yards
of
them
and
am
looking
about
me
when
my
eye
lights
upon
these
gray
motionless
figures
they
sit
perfectly
upright
some
with
their
backs
and
some
with
their
breasts
toward
me
but
every
head
turned
squarely
in
my
direction
their
eyes
are
closed
to
a
mere
black
line
though
this
crack
they
are
watching
me
evidently
thinking
themselves
unobserved
the
spectacle
is
weird
and
grotesque
it
is
a
new
effect
the
night
side
of
the
woods
by
daylight
after
observing
them
a
moment
i
take
a
single
step
toward
them
when
quick
as
thought
their
eyes
fly
wide
open
their
attitude
is
changed
they
bend
some
this
way
some
that
and
instinct
with
life
and
motion
stare
wildly
about
them
another
step
and
they
all
take
flight
but
one
which
stoops
low
on
the
branch
and
with
the
look
of
a
frightened
cat
regards
me
for
a
few
seconds
over
its
shoulder
they
fly
swiftly
and
softly
and
disperse
through
the
trees
i
shoot
one
which
is
of
a
tawny
red
tint
like
that
figured
by
wilson
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
the
plumage
of
these
owls
presents
two
totally
distinct
phases
which
have
no
relation
to
sex
age
or
season
one
being
an
ashen
gray
the
other
a
bright
rufous
coming
to
a
drier
and
less
mossy
place
in
the
woods
i
am
amused
with
the
thrush
which
however
is
no
thrush
at
all
but
a
warbler
he
walks
on
the
ground
ahead
of
me
with
such
an
easy
gliding
motion
and
with
such
an
unconscious
preoccupied
air
jerking
his
head
like
a
hen
or
a
partridge
now
hurrying
now
slackening
his
pace
that
i
pause
to
observe
him
i
sit
down
he
pauses
to
observe
me
and
extends
his
pretty
ramblings
on
all
sides
apparently
very
much
engrossed
with
his
own
affairs
but
never
losing
sight
of
me
but
few
of
the
birds
are
walkers
most
being
hoppers
like
the
robin
satisfied
that
i
have
no
hostile
intentions
the
pretty
pedestrian
mounts
a
limb
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
and
gives
me
the
benefit
of
one
of
his
musical
performances
a
sort
of
accelerating
chant
commencing
in
a
very
low
key
which
makes
him
seem
at
a
very
uncertain
distance
he
grows
louder
and
louder
till
his
body
quakes
and
his
chant
runs
into
a
shriek
ringing
in
my
ear
with
a
peculiar
sharpness
this
lay
may
be
represented
thus
transcribists
note
original
book
uses
font
shifts
to
illustrate
an
increase
in
volume
teacher
teacher
teacher
teacher
teacher
the
accent
on
the
first
syllable
and
each
word
uttered
with
increased
force
and
shrillness
no
writer
with
whom
i
am
acquainted
gives
him
credit
for
more
musical
ability
than
is
displayed
in
this
strain
yet
in
this
the
half
is
not
told
he
has
a
far
rarer
song
which
he
reserves
for
some
nymph
whom
he
meets
in
the
air
mounting
by
easy
flights
to
the
top
of
the
tallest
tree
he
launches
into
the
air
with
a
sort
of
suspended
hovering
flight
like
certain
of
the
finches
and
bursts
into
a
perfect
ecstasy
of
song
clear
ringing
copious
rivaling
the
goldfinch
in
vivacity
and
the
linnet
in
melody
this
strain
is
one
of
the
rarest
bits
of
bird
melody
to
be
heard
and
is
oftenest
indulged
in
late
in
the
afternoon
or
after
sundown
over
the
woods
hid
from
view
the
ecstatic
singer
warbles
his
finest
strain
in
this
song
you
instantly
detect
his
relationship
to
the
erroneously
called
whose
song
is
likewise
a
sudden
burst
full
and
ringing
and
with
a
tone
of
youthful
joyousness
in
it
as
if
the
bird
had
just
had
some
unexpected
good
fortune
for
nearly
two
years
this
strain
of
the
pretty
walker
was
little
more
than
a
disembodied
voice
to
me
and
i
was
puzzled
by
it
as
thoreau
by
his
mysterious
which
by
the
way
i
suspect
was
no
new
bird
at
all
but
one
he
was
otherwise
familiar
with
the
little
bird
himself
seems
disposed
to
keep
the
matter
a
secret
and
improves
every
opportunity
to
repeat
before
you
his
shrill
accelerating
lay
as
if
this
were
quite
enough
and
all
he
laid
claim
to
still
i
trust
i
am
betraying
no
confidence
in
making
the
matter
public
here
i
think
this
is
preëminently
his
as
i
hear
it
oftenest
about
the
mating
season
i
have
caught
bursts
of
it
from
two
males
chasing
each
other
with
fearful
speed
through
the
forest
turning
to
the
left
from
the
old
road
i
wander
over
soft
logs
and
gray
yielding
débris
across
the
little
trout
brook
until
i
emerge
in
the
overgrown
barkpeeling
pausing
now
and
then
on
the
way
to
admire
a
small
solitary
now
and
then
on
the
way
to
admire
a
small
solitary
white
flower
which
rises
above
the
moss
with
radical
leaves
and
a
blossom
precisely
like
the
liverwort
except
in
color
but
which
is
not
put
down
in
my
botany
or
to
observe
the
ferns
of
which
i
count
six
varieties
some
gigantic
ones
nearly
at
the
foot
of
a
rough
scraggly
yellow
birch
on
a
bank
of
so
richly
inlaid
with
and
curious
shining
leaves
with
here
and
there
in
the
bordering
a
spire
of
false
wintergreen
strung
with
faint
pink
flowers
and
exhaling
the
breath
of
a
may
orchard
that
it
looks
too
costly
a
couch
for
such
an
idler
i
recline
to
note
what
transpires
the
sun
is
just
past
the
meridian
and
the
afternoon
chorus
is
not
yet
in
full
tune
most
birds
sing
with
the
greatest
spirit
and
vivacity
in
the
forenoon
though
there
are
occasional
bursts
later
in
the
day
in
which
nearly
all
voices
join
while
it
is
not
till
the
twilight
that
the
full
power
and
solemnity
of
the
thrush
hymn
is
felt
my
attention
is
soon
arrested
by
a
pair
of
hummingbirds
the
disporting
themselves
in
a
low
bush
a
few
yards
from
me
the
female
takes
shelter
amid
the
branches
and
squeaks
exultingly
as
the
male
circling
above
dives
down
as
if
to
dislodge
her
seeing
me
he
drops
like
a
feather
on
a
slender
twig
and
in
a
moment
both
are
gone
then
as
if
by
a
preconcerted
signal
the
throats
are
all
atune
i
lie
on
my
back
with
eyes
half
closed
and
analyze
the
chorus
of
warblers
thrushes
finches
and
flycatchers
while
soaring
above
all
a
little
withdrawn
and
alone
rises
the
divine
contralto
of
the
hermit
that
richly
modulated
warble
proceeding
from
the
top
of
yonder
birch
and
which
unpracticed
ears
would
mistake
for
the
voice
of
the
scarlet
tanager
comes
from
that
rare
visitant
the
grosbeak
it
is
a
strong
vivacious
strain
a
bright
noonday
song
full
of
health
and
assurance
indicating
fine
talents
in
the
performer
but
not
a
genius
as
i
come
up
under
the
tree
he
casts
his
eye
down
at
me
but
continues
his
song
this
bird
is
said
to
be
quite
common
in
the
northwest
but
he
is
rare
in
the
eastern
districts
his
beak
is
disproportionately
large
and
heavy
like
a
huge
nose
which
slightly
mars
his
good
looks
but
nature
has
made
it
up
to
him
in
a
blush
rose
upon
his
breast
and
the
most
delicate
of
pink
linings
to
the
under
side
of
his
wings
his
back
is
variegated
black
and
white
and
when
flying
low
the
white
shows
conspicuously
if
he
passed
over
your
head
you
would
not
the
delicate
flush
under
his
wings
that
bit
of
bright
scarlet
on
yonder
dead
hemlock
glowing
like
a
live
coal
against
the
dark
background
seeming
almost
too
brilliant
for
the
severe
northern
climate
is
his
relative
the
scarlet
tanager
i
occasionally
meet
him
in
the
deep
hemlocks
and
know
no
stronger
contrast
in
nature
i
almost
fear
he
will
kindle
the
dry
limb
on
which
he
alights
he
is
quite
a
solitary
bird
and
in
this
section
seems
to
prefer
the
high
remote
woods
even
going
quite
to
the
mountain
top
indeed
the
event
of
my
last
visit
to
the
mountain
was
meeting
one
of
these
brilliant
creatures
near
the
summit
in
full
song
the
breeze
carried
the
notes
far
and
wide
he
seemed
to
enjoy
the
elevation
and
i
imagined
his
song
had
more
scope
and
freedom
than
usual
when
he
had
flown
far
down
the
the
breeze
still
brought
me
his
finest
notes
in
plumage
he
is
the
most
brilliant
bird
we
have
the
bluebird
is
not
entirely
blue
nor
will
the
bear
a
close
inspection
nor
the
goldfinch
nor
the
summer
redbird
but
the
tanager
loses
nothing
by
a
near
view
the
deep
scarlet
of
his
body
and
the
black
of
his
wings
and
tail
are
quite
perfect
this
is
his
holiday
suit
in
the
fall
be
becomes
a
dull
yellowish
green
the
color
of
the
female
the
whole
season
one
of
the
leading
songsters
in
this
choir
of
the
old
barkpeeling
is
the
purple
finch
or
linnet
he
sits
somewhat
apart
usually
on
a
dead
hemlock
and
warbles
most
exquisitely
he
is
one
of
our
finest
songsters
and
stands
at
the
head
of
the
finches
as
the
hermit
at
the
head
of
the
thrushes
his
song
approaches
an
ecstasy
and
with
the
exception
of
the
winter
wren
is
the
most
rapid
and
copious
strain
to
be
heard
in
these
woods
it
is
quite
destitute
of
the
trills
and
the
liquid
silvery
bubbling
notes
that
characterize
the
wren
but
there
runs
through
it
a
round
richly
modulated
whistle
very
sweet
and
very
pleasing
the
call
of
the
robin
is
brought
in
at
a
certain
point
with
marked
effect
and
throughout
the
variety
is
so
great
and
the
strain
so
rapid
that
the
impression
is
as
of
two
or
three
birds
singing
at
the
same
time
he
is
not
common
here
and
i
only
find
him
in
these
or
similar
woods
his
color
is
peculiar
and
looks
as
if
it
might
have
been
imparted
by
dipping
a
brown
bird
in
diluted
pokeberry
juice
two
or
three
more
dipping
would
have
made
the
purple
complete
the
female
is
the
color
of
the
song
sparrow
a
little
larger
with
heavier
beak
and
tail
much
more
forked
in
a
little
opening
quite
free
from
brush
and
trees
i
step
down
to
bath
my
hands
in
the
brook
when
a
small
light
bird
flutters
out
of
the
bank
not
three
feet
from
my
head
as
i
stoop
down
and
as
if
severely
lamed
or
injured
flutters
through
the
grass
and
into
the
nearest
bush
as
i
do
not
follow
but
remain
near
the
nest
she
chips
sharply
which
brings
the
male
and
i
see
it
is
the
speckled
canada
warbler
i
find
no
authority
in
the
books
for
this
bird
to
build
upon
the
ground
yet
here
is
the
nest
made
chiefly
of
dry
grass
set
in
a
slight
excavation
in
the
bank
not
two
feet
from
the
water
and
looking
a
little
perilous
to
anything
but
ducklings
or
sandpipers
there
are
two
young
birds
and
one
little
speckled
egg
just
pipped
but
how
is
this
what
mystery
is
here
one
nestling
is
much
larger
than
the
other
monopolizes
most
of
the
nest
and
lifts
its
open
mouth
far
above
that
of
its
companion
though
obviously
both
are
of
the
same
age
not
more
than
a
day
old
ah
i
see
the
old
trick
of
the
cow
bunting
with
a
stinging
human
significance
taking
the
interloper
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
i
deliberately
drop
it
into
the
water
but
not
without
a
pang
as
i
see
its
naked
form
convulsed
with
chills
float
downstream
cruel
so
is
nature
cruel
i
take
one
life
to
save
two
in
less
than
two
days
this
intruder
would
have
caused
the
death
of
the
two
rightful
occupants
of
the
nest
so
i
step
in
and
turn
things
into
their
proper
channel
again
it
is
a
similar
freak
of
nature
this
instinct
which
prompts
one
bird
to
lay
its
eggs
in
the
nests
of
others
and
thus
shirk
the
responsibility
of
rearing
its
own
young
the
cow
buntings
always
resort
to
this
cunning
trick
and
when
one
reflects
upon
their
numbers
it
is
evident
that
these
little
tragedies
are
quite
frequent
in
europe
the
parallel
case
is
that
of
the
cuckoo
and
occasionally
our
own
cuckoo
imposes
upon
a
robin
or
a
thrush
in
the
same
manner
the
cow
bunting
seems
to
have
no
conscience
about
the
matter
and
so
far
as
i
have
observed
invariable
selects
the
nest
of
a
bird
smaller
than
itself
its
egg
is
usually
the
first
to
hatch
its
young
overreaches
all
the
rest
when
food
is
brought
it
grow
with
great
rapidity
spreads
and
fills
the
nest
and
the
starved
and
crowded
occupants
soon
perish
when
the
parent
bird
removes
their
dead
bodies
giving
its
whole
energy
and
care
to
the
the
warblers
and
smaller
flycatchers
are
generally
the
sufferers
though
i
sometimes
see
the
snowbird
unconsciously
duped
in
like
manner
and
the
other
day
in
a
tall
tree
in
the
woods
i
discovered
the
warbler
devoting
itself
to
this
dusky
foundling
an
old
farmer
to
whom
i
pointed
out
the
fact
was
much
surprised
that
such
things
should
happen
in
his
woods
without
his
knowledge
these
birds
may
be
seen
prowling
through
all
parts
of
the
woods
at
this
season
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
steal
their
egg
into
some
nest
one
day
while
sitting
on
a
log
i
saw
one
moving
by
short
flights
through
the
trees
and
gradually
nearing
the
ground
its
movements
were
hurried
and
stealthy
about
fifty
yards
from
me
it
disappeared
behind
some
low
brush
and
had
evidently
alighted
upon
the
ground
after
waiting
a
few
moments
i
cautiously
walked
in
the
direction
when
about
halfway
i
accidentally
made
a
slight
noise
when
the
bird
flew
up
and
seeing
me
hurried
out
of
the
woods
arrived
at
the
place
i
found
a
simple
nest
of
dry
grass
and
leaves
partially
concealed
under
a
prostrate
branch
i
took
it
to
be
the
nest
of
a
sparrow
there
were
three
eggs
in
a
nest
and
one
lying
about
a
foot
below
it
as
if
it
had
been
rolled
out
as
of
course
it
had
it
suggested
the
thought
that
perhaps
when
the
cowbird
finds
the
full
complement
of
eggs
in
a
nest
it
throws
out
one
and
deposits
its
own
instead
i
revisited
the
nest
a
few
days
afterward
and
found
an
egg
again
cast
out
but
none
had
been
put
in
its
place
the
nest
had
been
abandoned
by
its
owner
and
the
eggs
were
stale
in
all
cases
where
i
have
found
this
egg
i
have
observed
both
male
and
female
cowbird
lingering
near
the
former
uttering
his
peculiar
liquid
glassy
note
from
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
july
the
young
which
have
been
reared
in
the
same
neighborhood
and
which
are
now
of
a
dull
fawn
color
begin
to
collect
in
small
flocks
which
grow
to
be
quite
large
in
autumn
the
specked
canada
is
a
very
superior
warbler
having
a
lively
animated
strain
reminding
you
of
certain
parts
of
the
canary
though
quite
broken
and
incomplete
the
bird
the
while
hopping
amid
the
branches
with
increased
liveliness
and
indulging
in
fine
sibilant
chirps
too
happy
to
keep
silent
his
manners
are
quite
marked
he
has
a
habit
of
courtesying
when
he
discovers
you
which
is
very
pretty
in
form
he
is
an
elegant
bird
somewhat
slender
his
back
of
a
bluish
becoming
nearly
black
on
his
crown
the
under
part
of
his
body
from
his
throat
down
is
of
a
light
delicate
yellow
with
a
belt
of
black
dots
across
his
breast
he
has
a
fine
eye
surrounded
by
a
light
yellow
ring
the
parent
birds
are
much
disturbed
by
my
presence
and
keep
up
a
loud
emphatic
chirping
which
attracts
the
attention
of
their
sympathetic
neighbors
and
one
after
another
they
come
to
see
what
has
happened
the
and
the
blackburnian
come
in
company
the
black
and
yellow
warbler
pauses
a
moment
and
hastens
away
the
maryland
peeps
shyly
from
the
lower
bushes
and
utters
his
fip
fip
in
sympathy
the
wood
pewee
comes
straight
to
the
tree
overhead
and
the
vireo
lingers
and
lingers
eyeing
me
with
a
curious
innocent
look
evidently
much
puzzled
but
all
disappear
again
one
by
one
apparently
without
a
word
of
condolence
or
encouragement
to
the
distressed
pair
i
have
often
noticed
among
birds
this
show
of
sympathy
if
indeed
it
be
sympathy
and
not
merely
curiosity
or
desire
to
be
forewarned
of
the
approach
of
a
common
danger
an
hour
afterward
i
approach
the
place
find
all
still
and
the
mother
bird
upon
her
nest
as
i
draw
near
she
seems
to
sit
closer
her
eyes
growing
large
with
an
inexpressibly
wild
beautiful
look
she
keeps
her
place
till
i
am
within
two
paces
of
her
when
she
flutters
away
as
at
first
in
the
brief
interval
the
remaining
egg
has
hatched
and
the
two
little
nestling
lift
their
heads
without
being
jostled
or
overreached
by
any
strange
bedfellow
a
week
afterward
and
they
were
flown
away
so
brief
is
the
infancy
of
birds
and
the
wonder
is
that
they
escape
even
for
this
short
time
the
skunks
and
minks
and
muskrats
that
abound
here
and
that
have
a
decided
partiality
for
such
tidbits
i
pass
on
through
the
old
barkpeeling
now
threading
an
obscure
or
an
overgrown
now
clambering
over
soft
and
decayed
logs
or
forcing
my
way
through
a
network
of
briers
and
hazels
now
entering
a
perfect
bower
of
wild
cherry
beech
and
soft
maple
now
emerging
into
a
grassy
lane
golden
with
buttercups
or
white
with
daisies
or
wading
in
the
red
whir
whir
whir
and
a
brood
of
partridges
start
up
like
an
explosion
a
few
paces
from
me
and
scattering
disappear
in
the
bushes
on
all
sides
let
me
sit
down
here
behind
the
screen
of
ferns
and
briers
and
hear
this
wild
hen
of
the
woods
call
together
her
brood
at
what
an
early
age
the
partridge
flies
nature
seems
to
concentrate
her
energies
on
the
wing
making
the
safety
of
a
bird
a
point
to
be
looked
after
first
and
while
the
body
is
covered
with
down
and
no
signs
of
feathers
are
visible
the
sprout
and
unfold
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
young
make
fair
headway
in
flying
the
same
rapid
development
of
wing
may
be
observed
in
chickens
and
turkeys
but
not
in
nor
in
birds
that
are
safely
housed
in
the
nest
till
the
other
day
by
a
brook
i
came
suddenly
upon
a
young
sandpiper
a
most
beautiful
creature
enveloped
in
a
soft
gray
down
swift
and
nimble
and
apparently
a
week
or
two
old
but
with
no
signs
of
plumage
either
of
body
or
wing
and
it
needed
none
for
it
escaped
me
by
taking
to
the
water
as
readily
as
if
it
had
flown
with
wings
hark
there
arises
over
there
in
the
brush
a
soft
persuasive
cooing
a
sound
so
subtle
and
wild
and
unobtrusive
that
it
requires
the
most
alert
and
watchful
ear
to
hear
it
how
gentle
and
solicitous
and
full
of
yearning
love
it
is
the
voice
of
the
mother
hen
presently
a
faint
timid
yeap
which
almost
eludes
the
ear
is
heard
in
various
direction
the
young
responding
as
no
danger
seems
near
the
cooing
of
the
parent
bird
is
soon
a
very
audible
clucking
call
and
the
young
move
cautiously
in
the
direction
let
me
step
never
to
carefully
from
my
and
all
sounds
instantly
cease
and
i
search
in
vain
for
either
parent
or
young
the
partridge
is
one
of
our
most
native
and
characteristic
birds
the
woods
seem
good
to
be
in
where
i
find
him
he
gives
a
habitable
air
to
the
forest
and
one
feels
as
if
the
rightful
occupant
was
really
at
home
the
woods
where
i
do
not
find
him
seem
to
want
something
as
if
suffering
from
some
neglect
of
nature
and
then
he
is
such
a
splendid
success
so
hardy
and
vigorous
i
think
he
enjoys
the
cold
and
the
snow
his
wings
seem
to
rustle
with
more
fervency
in
midwinter
if
the
snow
falls
very
fast
and
promises
a
heavy
storm
he
will
complacently
sit
down
allow
himself
to
be
snowed
under
approaching
him
at
such
times
he
suddenly
bursts
out
of
the
snow
at
your
feet
scattering
the
flakes
in
all
directions
and
goes
humming
away
through
the
woods
like
a
bombshell
a
picture
of
native
spirit
and
success
his
drum
is
one
of
the
most
welcome
and
beautiful
sounds
of
spring
scarcely
have
the
trees
expanded
their
buds
when
in
the
still
april
mornings
or
toward
nightfall
you
hear
the
hum
of
his
devoted
wings
he
selects
not
as
you
would
predict
a
dry
and
resinous
log
but
a
decayed
and
crumbling
one
seeming
to
give
the
preference
to
old
that
are
partly
blended
with
the
soil
if
a
log
to
his
taste
can
not
be
found
he
sets
up
his
alter
on
a
rock
which
becomes
resonant
beneath
his
fervent
blows
who
has
seen
the
partridge
drum
it
is
the
next
thing
to
catching
a
weasel
asleep
though
by
much
caution
and
tact
it
may
be
done
he
does
not
hug
the
log
but
stands
very
erect
expands
his
ruff
gives
two
introductory
blows
pauses
half
a
second
and
then
resumes
striking
faster
and
faster
till
the
sound
becomes
a
continuous
unbroken
whir
the
whole
lasting
less
than
half
a
minute
the
tips
of
his
wings
barely
brush
the
log
so
that
the
sound
is
produced
rather
by
the
force
of
the
blows
upon
the
air
and
upon
his
own
body
as
in
flying
one
log
will
be
used
for
many
years
though
not
by
the
same
drummer
it
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
temple
and
held
in
great
respect
the
bird
always
approaches
on
foot
and
leaves
it
in
the
same
quiet
manner
unless
rudely
disturbed
he
is
very
cunning
though
his
wit
is
not
profound
it
is
difficult
to
approach
him
by
stealth
you
will
try
many
times
before
succeeding
but
seem
to
pass
by
him
in
a
great
hurry
making
all
the
noise
possible
and
with
plumage
furled
he
stands
as
immovable
as
a
know
allowing
you
a
good
view
and
a
good
shot
if
you
are
a
sportsman
passing
along
one
of
the
old
barkpeelers
roads
which
wander
aimlessly
about
i
am
attracted
by
a
singularly
brilliant
and
emphatic
warble
proceeding
from
the
low
bushes
and
quickly
suggesting
the
voice
of
the
maryland
presently
the
singer
hops
up
on
a
dry
twig
and
gives
me
a
good
view
head
and
neck
becoming
nearly
black
on
the
breast
clear
back
and
yellow
belly
from
his
habit
of
keeping
near
the
ground
even
hopping
upon
it
occasionally
i
know
him
to
be
a
ground
warbler
from
his
dark
breast
the
ornithologist
has
added
the
expletive
mourning
hence
the
mourning
ground
warbler
of
this
bird
both
wilson
and
audubon
confessed
their
comparative
ignorance
neither
ever
having
seen
its
nest
or
become
acquainted
with
its
haunts
and
general
habits
its
song
is
quite
striking
and
novel
though
its
voice
at
once
suggests
the
class
of
warblers
to
which
it
belongs
it
is
very
shy
and
wary
flying
but
a
few
feet
at
a
time
and
studiously
concealing
itself
from
your
view
i
discover
but
one
pair
here
the
female
has
food
in
her
beak
but
carefully
avoids
betraying
the
locality
of
her
nest
the
ground
warblers
all
have
one
notable
feature
very
beautiful
legs
as
white
and
delicate
as
if
they
had
always
worn
silk
stockings
and
satin
slippers
high
tree
warblers
have
dark
brown
or
black
legs
and
more
brilliant
plumage
but
less
musical
ability
the
belongs
to
the
latter
class
he
is
quite
common
in
these
woods
as
in
all
the
woods
about
he
is
one
of
the
rarest
and
handsomest
of
the
warblers
his
white
breast
and
throat
chestnut
sides
and
yellow
crown
show
conspicuously
last
year
i
found
the
nest
of
one
in
an
uplying
beech
wood
in
a
low
bush
near
the
roadside
where
cows
passed
and
browsed
daily
things
went
on
smoothly
till
the
cow
bunting
stole
her
egg
into
it
when
other
mishaps
followed
and
the
nest
was
soon
empty
a
characteristic
attitude
of
the
male
during
this
season
is
a
slight
drooping
of
the
wings
and
a
tail
a
little
elevated
which
gives
him
a
very
smart
appearance
his
song
is
fine
and
hurried
and
not
much
of
itself
but
has
its
place
in
the
general
chorus
a
far
sweeter
strain
falling
on
the
ear
with
the
true
sylvan
cadence
is
that
of
the
warbler
whom
i
meet
at
various
points
he
has
no
superiors
among
the
true
sylvia
his
song
is
very
plain
and
simple
but
remarkably
pure
and
tender
and
might
be
indicated
by
straight
lines
thus
dashes
square
root
symbol
high
dash
the
first
two
marks
representing
two
sweet
silvery
notes
in
the
same
pitch
of
voice
and
quite
unaccented
the
latter
marks
the
concluding
notes
wherein
the
tone
and
inflection
are
changed
the
throat
and
breast
of
the
male
are
a
rich
black
like
velvet
his
face
yellow
and
his
back
a
yellowish
green
beyond
the
barkpeeling
where
the
woods
are
mingled
hemlock
beech
and
birch
the
languid
midsummer
note
of
the
falls
on
my
ear
twea
twea
in
the
upward
slide
and
with
the
peculiar
of
summer
insects
but
not
destitute
of
a
certain
plaintive
cadence
it
is
one
of
the
most
languid
unhurried
sounds
in
all
the
woods
i
feel
like
reclining
upon
the
dry
leaves
at
once
audubon
says
he
has
never
heard
his
but
this
is
all
the
he
has
and
he
is
evidently
a
very
plain
hero
with
his
little
brown
mistress
he
assumes
few
attitudes
and
is
not
a
bold
and
striking
gymnast
like
many
of
his
kindred
he
has
a
preference
for
dense
woods
of
beech
and
maple
moves
slowly
amid
the
lower
branches
and
smaller
growths
keeping
from
eight
to
ten
feet
from
the
ground
and
repeating
now
and
then
his
listless
indolent
strain
his
back
and
crown
are
dark
blue
his
throat
and
breast
black
his
belly
pure
white
and
he
has
a
white
spot
on
each
wing
here
and
there
i
meet
the
black
and
white
creeping
warbler
whose
fine
strain
reminds
me
of
hairwire
it
is
unquestionably
the
finest
to
be
heard
few
insect
strains
will
compare
with
it
in
this
respect
while
it
has
none
of
the
harsh
brassy
character
of
the
latter
being
very
delicate
and
tender
that
sharp
uninterrupted
but
still
continued
warble
which
before
one
has
learned
to
discriminate
closely
he
is
apt
to
confound
with
the
vireo
is
that
of
the
solitary
warbling
vireo
a
bird
slightly
larger
much
rarer
and
with
a
louder
less
cheerful
and
happy
strain
i
see
him
hopping
along
lengthwise
of
the
limbs
and
note
the
orange
tinge
of
his
breast
and
sides
and
the
white
circle
around
his
eye
but
the
declining
sun
and
the
deepening
shadows
admonish
me
that
this
ramble
must
be
brought
to
a
close
even
though
only
the
leading
characters
in
this
chorus
of
forty
songsters
have
been
described
and
only
a
small
portion
of
the
venerable
old
woods
explored
in
a
secluded
swampy
corner
of
the
old
barkpeeling
where
i
find
the
great
purple
orchis
in
bloom
and
where
the
foot
of
man
or
beast
seems
never
to
have
trod
i
linger
long
contemplating
the
wonderful
display
of
lichens
and
mosses
that
overrun
both
the
smaller
and
the
larger
growths
every
bush
and
branch
and
sprig
is
dressed
up
in
the
most
rich
and
fantastic
of
liveries
and
crowning
all
the
long
bearded
moss
festoons
the
branches
or
sways
gracefully
from
the
limbs
every
twig
looks
a
century
old
though
green
leaves
tip
the
end
of
it
a
young
yellow
birch
has
a
venerable
patriarchal
look
and
seems
ill
at
ease
under
such
premature
honors
a
decayed
hemlock
is
draped
as
if
by
hands
for
some
solemn
festival
mounting
toward
the
upland
again
i
pause
reverently
as
the
hush
and
stillness
of
twilight
com
upon
the
woods
it
is
the
sweetest
ripest
hour
of
the
day
and
as
the
hermit
evening
hymn
goes
up
from
the
deep
solitude
below
me
i
experience
that
serene
exaltation
of
sentiment
of
which
music
literature
and
religion
are
but
the
faint
types
and
symbols
iii
the
adirondacks
when
i
went
to
the
adirondacks
which
was
in
the
summer
of
i
was
in
the
first
flush
of
my
ornithological
studies
and
was
curious
above
else
to
know
what
birds
i
should
find
in
these
solitudes
what
new
ones
and
what
ones
already
known
to
me
in
visiting
vast
primitive
woods
one
naturally
expects
to
find
something
rare
and
precious
or
something
entirely
new
but
it
commonly
happens
that
one
is
disappointed
thoreau
made
three
excursions
into
the
maine
woods
and
though
he
started
the
moose
and
the
caribou
had
nothing
more
novel
to
report
by
way
of
bird
notes
than
the
songs
of
the
wood
thrush
and
the
pewee
this
was
about
my
own
experience
in
the
adirondacks
the
birds
for
the
most
part
prefer
the
vicinity
of
settlements
and
clearings
and
it
was
at
such
places
that
i
saw
the
greatest
number
and
variety
at
the
clearing
of
an
old
hunter
and
pioneer
by
the
name
of
hewett
where
we
paused
a
couple
of
days
on
first
entering
the
woods
i
saw
many
old
friends
and
made
some
new
acquaintances
the
snowbird
was
very
abundant
here
as
it
had
been
at
various
points
along
the
route
after
leaving
lake
george
as
i
went
out
to
the
spring
in
the
morning
to
wash
myself
a
purple
finch
flew
up
before
me
having
already
performed
its
ablutions
i
had
first
observed
this
bird
the
winter
before
in
the
highlands
of
the
hudson
where
during
several
clear
but
cold
february
mornings
a
troop
of
them
sang
most
charmingly
in
a
tree
in
front
of
my
house
the
meeting
with
the
bird
here
in
its
breeding
haunts
was
a
pleasant
surprise
during
the
day
i
observed
several
pine
finches
a
dark
brown
or
brindlish
bird
allied
to
the
common
yellowbird
which
it
much
resembles
in
its
manner
and
habits
they
lingered
familiarly
about
the
house
sometimes
alighting
in
a
small
tree
within
a
few
feet
of
it
in
one
of
the
stumpy
fields
i
saw
an
old
favorite
in
the
grass
finch
or
vesper
swallow
it
was
sitting
on
a
tall
charred
stub
with
food
in
its
beak
but
all
along
the
borders
of
the
woods
and
in
the
bushy
parts
of
the
fields
there
was
a
new
song
that
i
was
puzzled
in
tracing
to
the
author
it
was
most
noticeable
in
the
morning
and
at
twilight
but
was
at
all
times
singularly
secret
and
elusive
i
at
last
discovered
that
it
was
the
sparrow
a
common
bird
all
through
this
region
its
song
is
very
delicate
and
plaintive
a
thin
wavering
tremulous
whistle
which
disappoints
one
however
as
it
ends
when
it
seems
only
to
have
begun
if
the
bird
could
give
us
the
finishing
strain
of
which
this
seems
only
the
prelude
it
would
stand
first
among
feathered
songsters
by
a
little
trout
brook
in
a
low
part
of
the
woods
adjoining
the
clearing
i
had
a
good
time
pursuing
and
identifying
a
number
of
warblers
the
speckled
canada
the
blue
the
and
audubon
warbler
the
latter
which
was
leading
its
troop
of
young
through
a
thick
undergrowth
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
where
insects
were
plentiful
was
new
to
me
it
being
august
the
birds
were
all
moulting
and
sang
only
fitfully
and
by
brief
snatches
i
remember
hearing
but
one
robin
during
the
whole
trip
this
was
by
the
boreas
river
in
the
deep
forest
it
was
like
the
voice
of
an
old
friend
speaking
my
name
from
hewett
after
engaging
his
youngest
son
the
bub
of
the
family
a
young
man
about
twenty
and
a
thorough
woodsman
as
our
guide
we
took
to
the
woods
in
good
earnest
our
destination
being
the
stillwater
of
the
boreas
a
long
deep
dark
reach
in
one
of
the
remotest
branches
of
the
hudson
about
six
miles
distant
here
we
paused
a
couple
of
days
putting
up
in
a
dilapidated
shanty
and
cooking
our
fish
over
an
old
stove
which
had
been
left
there
the
most
noteworthy
incident
of
our
stay
at
this
point
was
the
taking
by
myself
of
half
a
dozen
splendid
trout
out
of
the
stillwater
after
the
guide
had
exhausted
his
art
and
his
patience
with
very
insignificant
results
the
place
had
a
very
trouty
look
but
as
the
season
was
late
and
the
river
warm
i
knew
the
fish
lay
in
deep
water
from
which
they
could
not
be
attracted
in
deep
water
accordingly
and
near
the
head
of
the
hole
i
determined
to
look
for
them
securing
a
chub
i
cut
it
into
pieces
about
an
inch
long
and
with
these
for
bait
sank
my
hook
into
the
head
of
the
stillwater
and
just
to
one
side
of
the
main
current
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
i
had
landed
six
noble
fellows
three
of
them
over
one
foot
long
each
the
guide
and
my
incredulous
companions
who
were
watching
me
from
the
opposite
shore
seeing
my
luck
whipped
out
their
tackle
in
great
haste
and
began
casting
first
at
a
respectable
distance
from
me
then
all
about
me
but
without
a
single
catch
my
own
efforts
suddenly
became
fruitless
also
but
i
had
conquered
the
guide
and
thenceforth
he
treated
me
with
the
tone
and
freedom
of
a
comrade
and
equal
one
afternoon
we
visited
a
cave
some
two
miles
down
the
stream
which
had
recently
been
discovered
we
squeezed
and
wriggled
through
a
big
crack
or
cleft
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
for
about
one
hundred
feet
when
we
emerged
into
a
large
passage
the
abode
during
certain
seasons
of
the
year
of
innumerable
bats
and
at
all
times
of
primeval
darkness
there
were
various
other
crannies
and
opening
into
it
some
of
which
we
explored
the
voice
of
running
water
was
everywhere
heard
betraying
the
proximity
of
the
little
stream
by
whose
ceaseless
corroding
the
cave
and
its
entrance
had
been
worn
this
streamlet
flowed
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
came
from
a
lake
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
this
accounted
for
its
warmth
to
the
hand
which
surprised
us
all
birds
of
any
kind
were
rare
in
these
woods
a
pigeon
hawk
came
prowling
by
our
camp
and
the
faint
piping
call
of
the
nuthatches
leading
their
young
through
the
high
trees
was
often
heard
on
the
third
day
our
guide
proposed
to
conduct
us
to
a
lake
in
the
mountains
where
we
could
float
for
deer
our
journey
commenced
in
a
steep
and
rugged
ascent
which
brought
us
after
an
hour
heavy
climbing
to
an
elevated
region
of
pine
forest
years
before
ravished
by
lumbermen
and
presenting
all
manner
of
obstacles
to
our
awkward
and
incumbered
pedestrianism
the
woods
were
largely
pine
though
yellow
birch
beech
and
maple
were
common
the
satisfaction
of
having
a
gun
should
any
game
show
itself
was
the
chief
compensation
to
those
of
us
who
were
thus
burdened
a
partridge
would
occasionally
whir
up
before
us
or
a
red
squirrel
snicker
and
hasten
to
his
den
else
the
woods
appeared
quite
tenantless
the
most
noted
object
was
a
mammoth
pine
apparently
the
last
of
a
great
race
which
presided
over
a
cluster
of
yellow
birches
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
about
noon
we
came
out
upon
a
long
shallow
sheet
of
water
which
the
guide
called
pond
from
the
tradition
that
a
moose
had
been
slaughtered
there
many
years
before
looking
out
over
the
silent
and
lonely
scene
his
eye
was
the
first
to
detect
an
object
apparently
feeding
upon
which
our
willing
fancies
readily
shaped
into
a
deer
as
we
were
eagerly
waiting
some
movement
to
confirm
this
impression
it
lifted
up
its
head
and
lo
a
great
blue
heron
seeing
us
approach
it
spread
its
long
wings
and
flew
solemnly
across
to
a
dead
tree
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
enhancing
rather
than
relieving
the
loneliness
and
desolation
that
brooded
over
the
scene
as
we
proceeded
it
flew
from
tree
to
tree
in
advance
of
us
apparently
loth
to
be
disturbed
in
its
ancient
and
solitary
domain
in
the
margin
of
the
pond
we
found
the
growing
and
here
and
there
in
the
sand
the
closed
gentian
lifted
up
its
blue
head
in
traversing
the
shores
of
this
wild
desolate
lake
i
was
conscious
of
a
slight
thrill
of
expectation
as
if
some
secret
of
nature
might
here
be
revealed
or
some
rare
and
game
disturbed
there
is
ever
a
lurking
suspicion
that
the
beginning
of
things
is
in
some
way
associated
with
water
and
one
may
notice
that
in
his
private
walks
he
is
led
by
a
curious
attraction
to
fetch
all
the
springs
and
ponds
in
his
route
as
if
by
them
was
the
place
for
wonders
and
miracles
to
happen
once
while
in
advance
of
my
companions
i
saw
from
a
high
rock
a
commotion
in
the
water
near
the
shore
but
on
reaching
the
point
found
only
the
marks
of
a
musquash
pressing
on
through
the
forest
after
many
adventures
with
we
reached
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
our
destination
pond
a
pretty
sheet
of
water
lying
like
a
silver
mirror
in
the
lap
of
the
mountain
about
a
mile
long
and
half
a
mile
wide
surrounded
by
dark
forests
of
balsam
hemlock
and
pine
and
like
the
one
we
had
just
passed
a
very
picture
of
unbroken
solitude
it
is
not
in
the
woods
alone
to
give
one
this
impression
of
utter
loneliness
in
the
woods
are
sounds
and
voices
and
a
dumb
kind
of
companionship
one
is
little
more
than
a
walking
tree
himself
but
come
upon
one
of
these
mountain
lakes
and
the
wildness
stands
revealed
and
meets
you
face
to
face
water
is
thus
facile
and
adaptive
that
makes
the
wild
more
wild
while
it
enhances
culture
and
art
the
end
of
the
pond
which
we
approached
was
quite
shoal
the
stones
rising
above
the
surface
as
in
a
summer
brook
and
everywhere
showing
marks
of
the
noble
game
we
were
in
quest
of
footprints
dung
and
cropped
and
uprooted
lily
pads
after
resting
for
a
half
hour
and
replenishing
our
at
the
expense
of
the
most
respectable
frogs
of
the
locality
we
filed
on
through
the
soft
resinous
intending
to
camp
near
the
other
end
of
the
lake
where
the
guide
assured
us
we
should
find
a
hunter
cabin
ready
built
a
march
brought
us
to
the
locality
and
a
most
delightful
one
it
was
so
hospitable
and
inviting
that
all
the
kindly
and
beneficent
influences
of
the
woods
must
have
abided
there
in
a
slight
depression
in
the
woods
about
one
hundred
yards
from
the
lake
though
hidden
from
it
for
a
hunter
reasons
surrounded
by
a
heavy
growth
of
birch
hemlock
and
pine
with
a
lining
of
balsam
and
fir
the
rude
cabin
welcomed
us
it
was
of
the
approved
style
three
sides
inclosed
with
a
roof
of
bark
and
a
bed
of
boughs
and
a
rock
in
front
that
afforded
a
permanent
backlog
to
all
fires
a
faint
voice
of
running
water
was
head
near
by
and
following
the
sound
a
delicious
spring
rivulet
was
disclosed
hidden
by
the
moss
and
débris
as
by
a
new
fall
of
snow
but
here
and
there
rising
in
little
openings
as
if
for
our
special
convenience
on
smooth
places
on
the
log
i
noticed
female
names
inscribed
in
a
female
hand
and
the
guide
told
us
of
an
english
lady
an
artist
who
had
traversed
this
region
with
a
single
guide
making
sketches
our
packs
unslung
and
the
kettle
over
our
first
move
was
to
ascertain
in
what
state
of
preservation
a
certain
might
be
which
the
guide
averred
he
had
left
moored
in
the
vicinity
the
summer
before
for
upon
this
hypothetical
our
hopes
of
venison
rested
after
a
little
searching
it
was
found
under
the
top
of
a
fallen
hemlock
but
in
a
sorry
condition
a
large
piece
had
been
split
out
of
one
end
and
a
fearful
chink
was
visible
nearly
to
the
water
line
freed
from
the
treetop
however
and
calked
with
a
little
moss
it
floated
with
two
aboard
which
was
quite
enough
for
our
purpose
a
jack
and
an
oar
were
necessary
to
complete
the
arrangement
and
before
the
sun
had
set
our
professor
of
had
both
in
readiness
from
a
young
yellow
birch
an
oar
took
shape
with
marvelous
rapidity
trimmed
and
smoothed
with
a
neatness
almost
fastidious
no
makeshift
but
an
instrument
fitted
for
the
delicate
work
it
was
to
perform
a
jack
was
make
with
equal
skill
and
speed
a
stout
staff
about
three
feet
long
was
placed
upright
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
held
to
its
place
by
a
horizontal
bar
through
a
hole
in
which
it
turned
easily
a
half
wheel
eight
or
ten
inches
in
diameter
cut
from
a
large
chip
was
placed
at
the
top
around
which
was
bent
a
new
section
of
birch
bark
thus
forming
a
rude
semicircular
reflector
three
candles
placed
within
the
circle
completed
the
jack
with
moss
and
boughs
seats
were
arranged
one
in
the
bow
for
the
marksman
and
one
in
the
stern
for
the
oarsman
a
meal
of
frogs
and
squirrels
was
a
good
preparation
and
when
darkness
came
all
were
keenly
alive
to
the
opportunity
it
brought
though
by
no
means
an
expert
in
the
use
of
the
gun
adding
the
superlative
degree
of
enthusiasm
to
only
the
positive
degree
of
skill
yet
it
seemed
tacitly
agreed
that
i
should
act
as
marksman
and
kill
the
deer
if
such
was
to
be
our
luck
after
it
was
thoroughly
dark
we
went
down
to
make
a
short
trial
trip
everything
working
to
satisfaction
about
ten
we
pushed
out
in
earnest
for
the
twentieth
time
i
felt
in
the
pocket
that
contained
the
matches
ran
over
the
part
i
was
to
perform
and
pressed
my
gun
firmly
to
be
sure
there
was
no
mistake
my
position
was
that
of
kneeling
directly
under
the
jack
which
i
was
to
light
at
the
word
the
night
was
clear
moonless
and
still
nearing
the
middle
of
the
lake
a
breeze
from
the
west
was
barely
perceptible
and
noiselessly
we
glided
before
it
the
guide
handled
his
oar
with
great
dexterity
without
lifting
it
from
the
water
or
breaking
the
surface
he
imparted
the
steady
uniform
motion
desired
how
silent
it
was
the
ear
seemed
the
only
sense
and
to
hold
dominion
over
lake
and
forest
occasionally
a
would
brush
along
the
bottom
and
stooping
low
i
could
hear
a
faint
murmuring
of
the
water
under
the
bow
else
all
was
still
then
almost
as
by
magic
we
were
encompassed
by
a
huge
black
ring
the
surface
of
the
lake
when
we
had
reached
the
center
was
slightly
luminous
from
the
starlight
and
the
dark
even
that
surrounded
us
doubled
by
reflection
in
the
water
presented
a
broad
unbroken
belt
of
utter
blackness
the
effect
was
quite
startling
like
some
huge
conjurer
trick
it
seemed
as
if
we
had
crossed
the
between
the
real
and
the
imaginary
and
this
was
indeed
the
land
of
shadows
and
of
spectres
what
magic
oar
was
that
the
guide
wielded
that
it
could
transport
me
to
such
a
realm
indeed
had
i
not
committed
some
fatal
mistake
and
left
that
trusty
servant
behind
and
had
not
some
wizard
of
the
night
stepped
into
his
place
a
slight
splashing
broke
the
spell
and
caused
me
to
turn
nervously
to
the
oarsman
musquash
said
he
and
kept
strait
on
nearing
the
extreme
end
of
the
pond
the
boat
gently
headed
around
and
silently
we
glided
back
into
the
clasp
of
that
strange
orbit
slight
sounds
were
heard
as
before
but
nothing
that
indicated
the
presence
of
the
game
we
were
waiting
for
and
we
reached
the
point
of
departure
as
innocent
of
venison
as
we
had
set
out
after
an
hour
delay
and
near
midnight
we
pushed
out
again
my
vigilance
and
susceptibility
were
rather
sharpened
than
dulled
by
the
waiting
and
the
features
of
the
night
had
also
deepened
and
intensified
night
was
at
its
meridian
the
sky
had
that
soft
luminousness
which
may
often
be
observed
near
midnight
at
this
season
and
the
large
few
stars
beamed
mildly
down
we
floated
out
into
that
spectral
and
moved
slowly
on
as
before
the
silence
was
most
impressive
now
and
then
the
faint
yeap
of
some
traveling
bird
would
come
from
the
air
overhead
or
the
wings
of
a
bat
whisp
quickly
by
or
an
owl
hoot
off
in
the
mountains
giving
to
the
silence
and
loneliness
a
tongue
at
short
intervals
some
noise
would
startle
me
and
cause
me
to
turn
inquiringly
to
the
silent
figure
in
the
stern
the
end
of
the
lake
was
reached
and
we
turned
back
the
novelty
and
the
excitement
began
to
flag
tired
nature
began
to
assert
her
claims
the
movement
was
soothing
and
the
gunner
slumbered
fitfully
at
his
post
presently
something
aroused
me
there
a
deer
whispered
the
guide
the
gun
heard
and
fairly
jumped
in
my
hand
listening
there
came
the
crackling
of
a
limb
followed
by
a
sound
as
of
something
walking
in
shallow
water
it
proceeded
from
the
other
end
of
the
lake
over
against
our
camp
on
we
sped
noiselessly
as
ever
but
with
increased
velocity
presently
with
a
thrill
of
new
intensity
i
saw
the
boat
was
gradually
heading
in
that
direction
now
to
a
sportsman
who
gets
excited
over
a
gray
squirrel
and
forgets
that
he
has
a
gun
on
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
fox
this
was
a
severe
trial
i
suddenly
felt
cramped
for
room
and
trimming
the
boat
was
out
of
the
question
it
seemed
that
i
must
make
some
noise
in
spite
of
myself
light
the
jack
said
a
soft
whisper
behind
me
i
fumbled
nervously
for
a
match
and
dropped
the
first
one
another
was
drawn
briskly
across
my
knee
and
broke
a
third
lighted
but
went
out
prematurely
in
my
haste
to
get
it
to
the
jack
what
would
i
not
have
given
to
see
those
wicks
blaze
we
were
fast
nearing
the
shore
already
the
began
to
brush
along
the
bottom
another
attempt
and
the
light
took
the
gentle
motion
fanned
the
blaze
and
in
a
moment
a
broad
glare
of
light
fell
upon
the
water
in
front
of
us
while
the
boat
remained
in
utter
darkness
by
this
time
i
had
got
beyond
the
nervous
point
and
had
come
round
to
perfect
coolness
and
composure
again
but
preternaturally
vigilant
and
keen
i
was
ready
for
any
disclosures
not
a
sound
was
heard
in
a
few
moments
the
trees
alongshore
were
faintly
visible
every
object
put
on
the
shape
of
a
gigantic
deer
a
large
rock
looked
just
ready
to
bound
away
the
dry
limbs
of
a
prostrate
tree
were
surely
his
antlers
but
what
are
those
two
luminous
spots
need
the
reader
be
told
what
they
were
in
a
moment
the
head
of
a
real
deer
became
outlined
then
his
neck
and
foreshoulders
then
his
whole
body
there
he
stood
up
to
his
knees
in
the
water
gazing
fixedly
at
us
apparently
arrested
in
the
movement
of
putting
his
head
down
for
a
and
evidently
thinking
it
was
some
moon
sporting
about
there
let
him
have
it
said
my
prompter
and
the
crash
came
there
was
a
scuffle
in
the
water
and
a
plunge
in
the
woods
he
gone
said
i
wait
a
moment
said
the
guide
and
i
will
show
you
rapidly
running
the
canoe
ashore
we
sprang
out
and
holding
the
jack
aloft
explored
the
vicinity
by
its
light
there
over
the
logs
and
brush
i
caught
the
glimmer
of
those
luminous
spots
again
but
poor
thing
there
was
little
need
of
the
second
shot
which
was
the
unkindest
of
all
for
the
deer
had
already
fallen
to
the
ground
and
was
fast
expiring
the
success
was
but
a
very
indifferent
one
after
all
as
the
victim
turned
out
to
be
only
an
old
doe
upon
whom
maternal
cares
had
evidently
worn
heavily
during
the
summer
this
mode
of
taking
deer
is
very
novel
and
strange
the
animal
is
evidently
fascinated
or
bewildered
it
does
not
appear
to
be
frightened
but
as
if
overwhelmed
with
amazement
or
under
the
influence
of
some
spell
it
is
not
sufficiently
master
of
the
situation
to
be
sensible
of
fear
or
to
think
of
escape
by
flight
and
the
experiment
to
be
successful
must
be
tried
quickly
before
the
first
feeling
of
bewilderment
passes
witnessing
the
spectacle
from
the
shore
i
can
conceive
of
nothing
more
sudden
or
astounding
you
see
no
movement
and
hear
no
noise
but
the
light
grows
upon
you
and
stares
and
stares
like
a
huge
eye
from
infernal
regions
according
to
the
guide
when
a
deer
has
been
played
upon
in
this
manner
and
escaped
he
is
not
to
be
fooled
again
a
second
time
mounting
the
shore
he
gives
a
long
signal
snort
which
alarms
every
animal
within
hearing
and
dashes
away
the
sequel
to
the
was
a
little
sharp
practice
with
a
revolver
upon
a
rabbit
or
properly
a
hare
which
was
so
taken
with
the
spectacle
of
the
and
the
sleeping
figures
lying
about
that
it
ventured
quite
up
in
our
midst
but
while
testing
the
quality
of
some
condensed
milk
that
sat
uncovered
at
the
foot
of
a
large
tree
poor
lepus
had
his
spine
injured
by
a
bullet
those
who
lodge
with
nature
find
early
rising
quite
in
order
it
is
our
voluptuous
beds
and
isolation
from
the
earth
and
the
air
that
prevents
us
from
emulating
the
birds
and
the
beasts
in
this
respect
with
the
citizen
in
his
chamber
it
is
not
morning
but
the
however
feels
morning
in
the
air
he
smells
it
hears
it
and
springs
up
with
the
general
awakening
none
were
tardy
at
the
row
of
white
chips
arranged
on
the
trunk
of
a
prostrate
tree
when
breakfast
was
halloed
for
we
were
all
anxious
to
try
the
venison
few
of
us
however
took
a
second
piece
it
was
black
and
strong
the
day
was
warm
and
calm
and
we
loafed
at
leisure
the
woods
were
nature
own
it
was
a
luxury
to
ramble
through
them
rank
and
shaggy
and
venerable
but
with
an
aspect
singularly
ripe
and
mellow
no
fire
had
consumed
and
no
lumberman
plundered
every
trunk
and
limb
and
leaf
lay
where
it
had
fallen
at
every
step
the
foot
sank
into
the
moss
which
like
a
soft
green
snow
covered
everything
making
every
stone
a
cushion
and
every
rock
a
bed
a
grand
old
norse
parlor
adorned
beyond
art
and
upholstered
beyond
skill
indulging
in
a
brief
nap
on
a
rug
of
carelessly
dropped
at
the
foot
of
a
i
woke
up
to
find
myself
the
subject
of
a
discussion
of
a
troop
of
chickadees
presently
three
or
four
shy
wood
warblers
came
to
look
upon
this
strange
creature
that
had
wandered
into
their
haunts
else
i
passed
quite
unnoticed
by
the
lake
i
met
that
orchard
beauty
the
cedar
waxwing
spending
his
vacation
in
the
assumed
character
of
a
flycatcher
whose
part
he
performed
with
great
accuracy
and
deliberation
only
a
month
before
i
had
seen
him
regaling
himself
upon
cherries
in
the
garden
and
orchard
but
as
the
approached
he
set
out
for
the
streams
and
lakes
to
divert
himself
with
the
more
exciting
pursuits
of
the
chase
from
the
tops
of
the
dead
trees
along
the
border
of
the
lake
he
would
sally
out
in
all
directions
sweeping
through
long
curves
alternately
mounting
and
descending
now
reaching
up
for
a
fly
high
in
the
air
now
sinking
low
for
one
near
the
surface
and
returning
to
his
perch
in
a
few
moments
for
a
fresh
start
the
pine
finch
was
also
here
though
as
usual
never
appearing
at
home
but
with
a
waiting
expectant
air
here
also
i
met
my
beautiful
singer
the
hermit
thrush
but
with
no
song
in
his
throat
now
a
week
or
two
later
and
he
was
on
his
journey
southward
this
was
the
only
species
of
thrush
i
saw
in
the
adirondacks
near
lake
sandford
where
were
large
tracks
of
raspberry
and
wild
cherry
i
saw
numbers
of
them
a
boy
whom
we
met
driving
home
some
stray
cows
said
it
was
the
no
doubt
from
the
resemblance
of
its
note
when
disturbed
to
the
cluck
of
the
partridge
nate
pond
contained
perch
and
sunfish
but
no
trout
its
water
was
not
pure
enough
for
trout
was
there
ever
any
other
fish
so
fastidious
as
this
requiring
such
sweet
harmony
and
perfection
of
the
elements
for
its
production
and
sustenance
on
higher
ground
about
a
mile
distant
was
a
trout
pond
the
shores
of
which
were
steep
and
rocky
our
next
move
was
a
tramp
of
about
twelve
miles
through
the
wilderness
most
of
the
way
in
a
drenching
rain
to
a
place
called
the
lower
iron
works
situated
on
the
road
leading
in
to
long
lake
which
is
about
a
day
drive
farther
on
we
found
a
comfortable
hotel
here
and
were
glad
enough
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
shelter
and
warmth
which
it
offered
there
was
a
little
settlement
and
some
quite
good
farms
the
place
commands
a
fine
view
to
the
north
of
indian
pass
mount
marcy
and
the
adjacent
mountains
on
the
afternoon
of
our
arrival
and
also
the
next
morning
the
view
was
completely
shut
off
by
the
fog
but
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
the
wind
changed
the
fog
lifted
and
revealed
to
us
the
grandest
mountain
scenery
we
had
beheld
on
our
journey
there
they
sat
about
fifteen
miles
distant
a
group
of
them
mount
marcy
mount
mcintyre
and
mount
golden
the
real
adirondack
monarchs
it
was
an
impressive
sight
rendered
double
so
be
the
sudden
manner
in
which
it
was
revealed
to
us
by
that
the
wind
i
saw
blackbirds
at
this
place
and
sparrows
and
the
solitary
sandpiper
and
the
canada
woodpecker
and
a
large
number
of
hummingbirds
indeed
i
saw
more
of
the
latter
here
than
i
ever
before
saw
in
any
one
locality
their
squeaking
and
whirring
were
almost
incessant
the
adirondack
iron
works
belong
to
the
past
over
thirty
years
ago
a
company
in
jersey
city
purchased
some
sixty
thousand
acres
of
land
lying
along
the
adirondack
river
and
abounding
in
magnetic
iron
ore
the
land
was
cleared
roads
dams
and
forges
constructed
and
the
work
of
manufacturing
iron
begun
at
this
point
a
dam
was
built
across
the
hudson
the
waters
of
which
flowed
back
into
lake
sandford
about
five
miles
above
the
lake
itself
being
some
six
miles
song
tolerable
navigation
was
thus
established
for
a
distance
of
eleven
miles
to
the
upper
works
which
seem
to
have
been
the
only
works
in
operation
at
the
lower
works
besides
the
remains
of
the
dam
the
only
vestige
i
saw
was
a
long
low
mound
overgrown
with
grass
and
weeds
that
suggested
a
rude
earthwork
we
were
told
that
it
was
once
a
pile
of
wood
containing
hundreds
of
cords
cut
in
regular
lengths
and
corded
up
here
for
use
in
the
furnaces
at
the
upper
works
some
twelve
miles
distant
quite
a
village
had
been
built
which
was
now
entirely
abandoned
with
the
exception
of
a
single
family
a
march
to
this
place
was
our
next
undertaking
the
road
for
two
or
three
miles
kept
up
from
the
river
and
led
us
by
three
or
four
rough
stumpy
farms
it
then
approached
the
lake
and
kept
along
its
shores
it
was
here
a
dilapidated
corduroy
structure
that
compelled
the
traveler
to
keep
an
eye
on
his
feet
blue
jays
two
or
three
small
hawks
a
solitary
wild
pigeon
and
ruffled
grouse
were
seen
along
the
route
now
and
then
the
lake
gleamed
through
the
trees
or
we
crossed
o
a
shaky
bridge
some
of
its
arms
or
inlets
after
a
while
we
began
to
pass
dilapidated
houses
by
the
roadside
one
little
frame
house
i
remembered
particularly
the
door
was
off
the
hinges
and
leaned
against
the
jams
the
windows
had
but
a
few
panes
left
which
glared
vacantly
the
yard
and
little
garden
spot
were
overrun
with
a
heavy
growth
of
timothy
and
the
fences
had
all
long
since
gone
to
decay
at
the
head
of
the
lake
a
large
stone
building
projected
from
the
steep
bank
and
extended
over
the
road
a
little
beyond
the
valley
opened
to
the
east
and
looking
ahead
about
one
mile
we
saw
smoke
going
up
from
a
single
chimney
pressing
on
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
we
entered
the
deserted
village
the
barking
dog
brought
the
whole
family
into
the
street
and
they
stood
till
we
came
up
strangers
in
that
country
were
a
novelty
and
we
were
greeted
like
familiar
acquaintances
hunter
the
head
proved
to
be
a
type
of
an
americanized
irishman
his
wife
was
a
scotch
woman
they
had
a
family
of
five
or
six
children
two
of
them
daughters
modest
comely
young
women
as
you
would
find
anywhere
the
elder
of
the
two

spent
a
winter
in
new
york
with
her
aunt
which
made
her
a
little
more
when
in
the
presence
of
the
strange
young
men

hired
by
the
company
at
a
dollar
a
day
to
live
here
and
see
that
things
were
not
wantonly
destroyed
but
allowed
to
go
to
decay
properly
and
decently
he
had
a
substantial
roomy
frame
house
and
any
amount
of
grass
and
woodland
he
had
good
barns
and
kept
considerable
stock
and
raised
various
farm
products
but
only
for
his
own
use
as
the
difficulties
of
transportation

seventy
miles

hundreds
of
tons
of
good
timothy
hay
annually
rot
upon
the
cleared
land
after
nightfall
we
went
out
and
walked
up
and
down
the
streets
it
was
a
curious
and
melancholy
spectacle
the
remoteness
and
surrounding
wildness
rendered
the
scene
doubly
impressive
and
the
next
day
and
the
next
the
place
was
an
object
of
wonder
there
were
about
thirty
buildings
in
all
most
of
them
small
frame
houses
with
a
door
and
two
windows
opening
into
a
small
yard
in
front
and
a
garden
in
the
rear
such
as
are
usually
occupied
by
the
laborers
in
a
country
manufacturing
district
there
was
one
large
a
schoolhouse
with
cupola
and
a
bell
in
it
and
numerous
sheds
and
forges
and
a
in
front
of
the
and
ready
to
be
rolled
to
their
place
on
the
carriage
lay
a
large
pile
of
pine
logs
so
decayed
that
one
could
run
his
through
them
near
by
a
building
filled
with
charcoal
was
bursting
open
and
the
coal
going
to
waste
on
the
ground
the
smelting
works
were
also
much
crumbled
by
time
the
schoolhouse
was
still
used
every
day
one
of
the
daughters
assembles
her
smaller
brothers
and
sisters
there
and
school
keeps
the
district
library
contained
nearly
one
hundred
readable
books
which
were
well
thumbed
the
absence
of
society
had
made
the
family
all
good
readers
we
brought
them
an
illustrated
newspaper
which
was
awaiting
them
in
the
at
the
lower
works
it
was
read
and
reread
with
great
eagerness
by
every
member
of
the
household
the
iron
ore
cropped
out
on
every
hand
there
was
apparently
mountains
of
it
one
could
see
it
in
the
stones
along
the
road
but
the
difficulties
met
with
in
separating
the
iron
from
its
alloys
together
with
the
expense
of
transportation
and
the
failure
of
certain
railroad
schemes
caused
the
works
to
be
abandoned
no
doubt
the
time
is
not
distant
when
these
obstacles
will
be
overcome
and
this
region
reopened
at
present
it
is
an
admirable
place
to
go
to
there
is
fishing
and
hunting
and
boating
and
within
easy
reach
and
a
good
roof
over
your
head
at
night
which
is
no
small
matter
one
is
often
disqualified
for
enjoying
the
woods
after
he
gets
there
by
the
loss
of
sleep
and
of
proper
food
taken
at
seasonable
times
this
point
attended
to
one
is
in
the
humor
for
any
enterprise
about
half
a
mile
northeast
of
the
village
is
lake
henderson
a
very
irregular
and
picturesque
sheet
of
water
surrounded
by
dark
evergreen
forests
and
abutted
by
two
or
three
bold
promontories
with
mottled
white
and
gray
rocks
its
greatest
extent
in
any
one
direction
is
perhaps
less
than
a
mile
its
waters
are
perfectly
clear
and
abound
in
lake
trout
a
considerable
stream
flows
into
it
which
comes
down
from
indian
pass
a
mile
south
of
the
village
is
lake
sandford
this
is
a
more
open
and
exposed
sheet
of
water
and
much
larger
from
some
parts
of
it
mount
marcy
and
the
gorge
of
the
indian
pass
are
seen
to
excellent
advantage
the
indian
pass
shows
as
a
huge
cleft
in
the
mountain
the
gray
walls
rising
on
one
side
perpendicularly
for
many
hundred
feet
this
lake
abounds
in
white
and
yellow
perch
and
in
pickerel
of
the
latter
single
specimens
are
often
caught
which
weigh
fifteen
pounds
there
were
a
few
wild
ducks
on
both
lakes
a
brood
of
the
goosander
or
red
merganser
the
young
not
yet
able
to
fly
were
the
occasion
of
some
spirited
rowing
but
with
two
pairs
of
oars
in
a
trim
light
skiff
it
was
impossible
to
come
up
with
them
yet
we
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
give
them
a
chase
every
day
when
we
first
came
on
the
lake
it
needed
a
good
long
pull
to
sober
us
down
so
we
could
fish
the
land
on
the
east
side
of
the
lake
had
been
burnt
over
and
was
now
mostly
grown
up
with
wild
cherry
and
red
raspberry
bushes
ruffed
grouse
were
found
here
in
great
numbers
the
canada
grouse
was
also
common
i
shot
eight
of
the
latter
in
less
than
an
hour
on
one
occasion
the
eighth
one
which
was
an
old
male
was
killed
with
smooth
my
shot
having
run
short
the
wounded
bird
ran
under
a
pile
of
brush
like
a
frightened
hen
thrusting
a
forked
stick
down
through
the
interstices
i
soon
stopped
his
breathing
wild
pigeons
were
quite
numerous
also
these
latter
recall
a
singular
freak
of
the
hawk
a
flock
of
pigeons
alighted
on
top
of
a
dead
hemlock
standing
in
the
edge
of
a
swamp
i
got
over
the
fence
and
moved
toward
them
across
an
open
space
i
had
not
taken
many
steps
when
on
looking
up
i
saw
the
whole
flock
again
in
motion
flying
very
rapidly
about
the
butt
of
a
hill
just
then
this
hawk
alighted
on
the
same
tree
i
stepped
back
into
the
road
and
paused
a
moment
in
doubt
which
course
to
go
at
that
instant
the
little
hawk
launched
into
the
air
and
came
as
straight
as
an
arrow
toward
me
i
looked
in
amazement
but
in
less
than
half
a
minute
he
was
within
fifty
feet
of
my
face
coming
full
tilt
as
if
he
had
sighted
my
nose
almost
in
i
let
fly
one
barrel
of
my
gun
and
the
mangled
form
of
the
audacious
marauder
fell
literally
between
my
feet
of
wild
animals
such
as
bears
panthers
wolves
wildcats
we
neither
saw
nor
heard
any
in
the
adirondacks
a
howling
wilderness
thoreau
says
seldom
ever
howls
the
howling
is
chiefly
done
by
the
imagination
of
the
traveler
hunter
said
he
often
saw
in
the
snow
but
had
never
yet
met
bruin
deer
are
more
or
less
abundant
everywhere
and
one
old
sportsman
declares
there
is
yet
a
single
moose
in
these
mountains
on
our
return
a
pioneer
settler
at
whose
house
we
stayed
overnight
told
us
a
long
adventure
he
had
had
with
a
panther
he
related
how
it
screamed
how
it
followed
him
in
the
brush
how
he
took
to
his
boat
how
its
eyes
gleamed
from
the
shore
and
how
he
fired
his
rifle
at
them
with
fatal
effect
his
wife
in
the
mean
time
took
something
from
a
drawer
and
as
her
husband
finished
his
recital
she
produced
a
of
the
identical
animal
with
marked
dramatic
effect
but
better
than
fish
or
game
or
grand
scenery
or
any
adventure
by
night
or
day
is
the
wordless
intercourse
with
rude
nature
one
has
on
these
expeditions
it
is
something
to
press
the
pulse
of
our
old
mother
by
mountain
lakes
and
streams
and
know
what
health
and
vigor
are
in
her
veins
and
how
regardless
of
observation
she
deports
herself
iv
how
alert
and
vigilant
the
birds
are
even
when
absorbed
in
building
their
nests
in
an
open
space
in
the
woods
i
see
a
pair
of
collecting
moss
from
the
top
of
a
dead
tree
following
the
direction
in
which
they
fly
i
soon
discover
the
nest
placed
in
the
fork
of
a
small
soft
maple
which
stands
amid
a
thick
growth
of
wild
and
young
beeches
carefully
concealing
myself
beneath
it
without
any
fear
that
the
workmen
will
hit
me
with
a
chip
or
let
fall
a
tool
i
await
the
return
of
the
busy
pair
presently
i
hear
the
note
and
the
female
sweeps
down
and
settles
unsuspectingly
into
the
structure
hardly
have
her
wings
rested
before
her
eye
has
penetrated
my
screen
and
with
a
hurried
movement
of
alarm
she
darts
away
in
a
moment
the
male
with
a
tuft
of
wool
in
his
beak
for
there
is
a
sheep
pasture
near
joins
her
and
the
two
reconnoitre
the
premises
from
the
surrounding
bushes
with
their
beaks
still
loaded
they
move
around
with
a
frightened
look
and
refuse
to
approach
the
nest
till
i
have
moved
off
and
lain
down
behind
a
log
then
one
of
them
ventures
to
alight
upon
the
nest
but
still
suspecting
all
is
not
right
quickly
darts
away
again
then
they
both
together
come
and
after
much
peeping
and
spying
about
and
apparently
much
anxious
consultation
cautiously
proceed
to
work
in
less
than
half
an
hour
it
would
seem
that
wool
enough
has
been
brought
to
supply
the
whole
family
real
and
prospective
with
socks
if
needles
and
fingers
could
be
found
fine
enough
to
knit
it
up
in
less
than
a
week
the
female
has
begun
to
deposit
her
eggs
four
of
them
in
as
many
days
white
tinged
with
purple
with
black
spots
on
the
larger
end
after
two
weeks
of
incubation
the
young
are
out
excepting
the
american
goldfinch
this
bird
builds
later
in
the
season
than
any
other
its
nest
in
our
northern
climate
seldom
being
undertaken
until
july
as
with
the
goldfinch
the
reason
is
probably
that
suitable
food
for
the
young
can
not
be
had
at
an
earlier
period
like
most
of
our
common
species
as
the
robin
sparrow
bluebird
pewee
wren
this
bird
sometimes
seeks
wild
remote
localities
in
which
to
rear
its
young
at
others
takes
up
its
abode
near
that
of
man
i
knew
a
pair
of
one
season
to
build
in
an
the
branches
of
which
rubbed
against
the
house
for
a
day
or
two
before
the
first
straw
was
laid
i
noticed
the
pair
carefully
exploring
every
branch
of
the
tree
the
female
taking
the
lead
the
male
following
her
with
an
anxious
note
and
look
it
was
evident
that
the
wife
was
to
have
her
choice
this
time
and
like
one
who
thoroughly
knew
her
mind
she
was
proceeding
to
take
it
finally
the
site
was
chosen
upon
a
high
branch
extending
over
one
low
wing
of
the
house
mutual
congratulations
and
caresses
followed
when
both
birds
flew
away
in
quest
of
building
material
that
most
freely
used
is
a
sort
of
plant
which
grows
in
old
wornout
fields
the
nest
is
large
for
the
size
of
the
bird
and
very
soft
it
is
in
every
respect
a
domicile
on
another
occasion
while
walking
or
rather
sauntering
in
the
woods
for
i
have
discovered
that
one
can
not
run
and
read
the
book
of
nature
my
attention
was
arrested
by
a
dull
hammering
evidently
but
a
few
rods
off
i
said
to
myself
some
one
is
building
a
house
from
what
i
had
previously
seen
i
suspected
the
builder
to
be
a
woodpecker
in
the
top
of
a
dead
oak
stub
near
by
moving
cautiously
in
that
direction
i
perceived
a
round
hole
about
the
size
of
that
made
by
an
auger
near
the
top
of
the
decayed
trunk
and
the
white
chips
of
the
workman
strewing
the
ground
beneath
when
but
a
few
paces
from
the
tree
my
foot
pressed
upon
a
dry
twig
which
gave
forth
a
very
slight
snap
instantly
the
hammering
ceased
and
a
scarlet
head
appeared
at
the
door
though
i
remained
perfectly
motionless
forbearing
even
to
wink
till
my
eyes
smarted
the
bird
refused
to
go
on
with
his
work
but
flew
quietly
off
to
a
neighboring
tree
what
surprised
me
was
that
amid
his
busy
occupation
down
in
the
heart
of
the
old
tree
he
should
have
been
so
alert
and
watchful
as
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
from
without
the
woodpeckers
all
build
in
about
the
same
manner
excavating
the
trunk
or
branch
of
a
decayed
tree
and
depositing
the
eggs
on
the
fine
fragments
of
wood
at
the
bottom
of
the
cavity
though
the
nest
is
not
especially
an
artistic
work
requiring
strength
rather
than
skill
yet
the
eggs
and
the
young
of
few
other
birds
are
so
completely
housed
from
the
elements
or
protected
from
their
natural
enemies
the
jays
hawks
and
owls
a
tree
with
a
natural
cavity
is
never
selected
but
one
which
has
been
dead
just
long
enough
to
have
become
soft
and
brittle
throughout
the
bird
goes
in
horizontally
for
a
few
inches
making
a
hole
perfectly
round
and
smooth
and
adapted
to
his
size
then
turns
downward
gradually
enlarging
the
hole
as
he
proceeds
to
the
softness
of
the
tree
and
the
urgency
of
the
mother
bird
to
deposit
her
eggs
while
excavating
male
and
female
work
alternately
after
one
has
been
engaged
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
drilling
and
carrying
out
chips
it
ascends
to
an
upper
limb
utters
a
loud
call
or
two
when
its
mate
soon
appears
and
alighting
near
it
on
the
branch
the
pair
chatter
and
caress
a
moment
then
the
fresh
one
enters
the
cavity
and
the
other
flies
away
a
few
days
since
i
climbed
up
to
the
nest
of
the
downy
woodpecker
in
the
decayed
top
of
a
sugar
maple
for
better
protection
against
driving
rains
the
hole
which
was
rather
more
than
an
inch
in
diameter
was
made
immediately
beneath
a
branch
which
stretched
out
almost
horizontally
from
the
main
stem
it
appeared
merely
a
deeper
shadow
upon
the
dark
and
mottled
surface
of
the
bark
with
which
the
branches
were
covered
and
could
not
be
detected
by
the
eye
until
one
was
within
a
few
feet
of
it
the
young
chirped
vociferously
as
i
approached
the
nest
thinking
it
was
the
old
one
with
food
but
the
clamor
suddenly
ceased
as
i
put
my
hand
on
that
part
of
the
trunk
in
which
they
were
concealed
the
unusual
jarring
and
rustling
alarming
them
into
silence
the
cavity
which
was
about
fifteen
inches
deep
was
and
was
wrought
out
with
great
skill
and
regularity
the
walls
were
quite
smooth
and
clean
and
new
i
shall
never
forget
the
circumstances
of
observing
a
pair
of
woodpeckers
the
most
rare
and
secluded
and
nest
to
the
the
most
beautiful
species
found
in
our
woods
breeding
in
an
old
truncated
beech
in
the
beaverkill
mountains
on
offshoot
of
the
catskills
we
had
been
traveling
three
of
us
all
day
in
search
of
a
trout
lake
which
lay
far
in
among
the
mountains
had
twice
lost
our
course
in
the
trackless
forest
and
weary
and
hungry
had
sat
down
to
rest
upon
a
decayed
log
the
chattering
of
the
young
and
the
passing
to
and
fro
of
the
parent
birds
soon
arrested
my
attention
the
entrance
to
the
nest
was
on
the
east
side
of
the
tree
about
feet
from
the
ground
at
intervals
of
scarcely
a
minute
the
old
birds
one
after
the
other
would
alight
upon
the
edge
of
the
hole
with
a
grub
or
worm
in
their
beaks
then
each
in
turn
would
make
a
bow
or
two
cast
an
eye
quickly
around
and
by
a
single
movement
place
itself
in
the
neck
of
the
passage
here
it
would
pause
a
moment
as
if
to
determine
in
which
expectant
mouth
to
place
the
morsel
and
then
disappear
within
in
about
half
a
minute
during
which
time
that
chattering
of
the
young
gradually
subsided
the
bird
would
again
emerge
but
this
time
bearing
in
its
beak
the
ordure
of
one
of
the
helpless
family
flying
away
very
slowly
with
head
lowered
and
extended
as
if
anxious
to
hold
the
offensive
object
as
far
from
its
plumage
as
possible
the
bird
dropped
the
unsavory
morsel
in
the
course
of
a
few
yards
and
alighting
on
a
tree
wiped
its
bill
on
the
bark
and
moss
this
seems
to
be
the
order
all
day
carrying
in
and
carrying
out
i
watched
the
birds
for
an
hour
while
my
companions
were
taking
their
turns
in
exploring
the
lay
of
the
land
around
us
and
noted
no
variation
in
the
programme
it
would
be
curious
to
know
if
the
young
are
fed
and
waited
upon
in
regular
order
and
how
amid
the
darkness
and
the
crowded
state
of
the
apartment
the
matter
is
so
neatly
managed
but
ornithologists
are
all
silent
upon
the
subject
this
practice
of
the
birds
is
not
so
uncommon
as
it
might
at
first
seem
it
is
indeed
almost
an
invariable
rule
among
all
land
birds
with
woodpeckers
and
kindred
species
and
with
birds
that
burrow
in
the
ground
as
bank
swallows
kingfishers
it
is
a
necessity
the
accumulation
of
the
excrement
in
the
nest
would
prove
most
fatal
to
the
young
but
even
among
birds
that
neither
bore
nor
mine
but
which
build
a
shallow
nest
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
or
upon
the
ground
as
the
robin
the
finches
the
buntings
the
ordure
of
the
young
is
removed
to
a
distance
by
the
parent
bird
when
the
robin
is
seen
going
away
from
its
brood
with
a
slow
heavy
flight
entirely
different
from
its
manner
a
moment
before
on
approaching
the
nest
with
a
cherry
or
worm
it
is
certain
to
be
engaged
in
this
office
one
may
observe
the
social
sparrow
when
feeding
its
young
pause
a
moment
after
the
worm
has
been
given
and
hop
around
on
the
brink
of
the
nest
observing
the
movements
within
the
instinct
of
cleanliness
no
doubt
prompts
the
action
in
all
cases
though
the
disposition
to
secrecy
or
concealment
may
not
me
unmixed
in
it
the
swallows
form
an
exception
to
the
rule
the
excrement
being
voided
by
the
young
over
the
brink
of
the
nest
they
form
an
exception
also
to
the
rule
of
secrecy
aiming
not
so
much
to
conceal
the
nest
as
to
render
it
inaccessible
other
exceptions
are
the
pigeons
hawks
and
but
to
return
having
a
good
chance
to
note
the
color
and
markings
of
the
woodpeckers
as
they
passed
in
and
out
at
the
opening
of
the
nest
i
saw
that
audubon
had
made
a
mistake
in
figuring
or
describing
the
female
of
this
species
with
the
red
spot
upon
the
head
i
have
seen
a
number
of
pairs
of
them
and
in
no
instance
have
i
seen
the
mother
bird
marked
with
red
the
male
was
in
full
plumage
and
i
reluctantly
shot
him
for
a
specimen
passing
by
the
place
again
next
day
i
paused
a
moment
to
note
how
matters
stood
i
confess
it
was
not
without
some
compunctions
that
i
heard
the
cries
of
the
young
birds
and
saw
the
widowed
mother
her
cares
now
doubled
hastening
to
and
fro
in
the
solitary
woods
she
would
occasionally
pause
expectantly
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
utter
a
loud
call
it
usually
happens
when
the
male
of
any
species
is
killed
during
the
breeding
season
that
the
female
soon
procures
another
mate
there
are
most
likely
always
a
few
unmated
birds
of
both
sexes
within
a
given
range
and
through
these
the
broken
links
may
be
restored
audubon
or
wilson
i
forget
which
tells
of
a
pair
of
fish
hawks
or
ospreys
that
built
their
nest
in
an
ancient
oak
the
male
was
so
zealous
in
the
defense
of
the
young
that
he
actually
attacked
with
beak
and
claw
a
person
who
attempted
to
climb
into
his
nest
putting
his
face
and
eyes
in
great
jeopardy
arming
himself
with
a
heavy
club
the
climber
felled
the
gallant
bird
to
the
ground
and
killed
him
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
the
female
had
procured
another
mate
but
naturally
enough
the
stepfather
showed
none
of
the
spirit
and
pluck
in
defense
of
the
brood
that
had
been
displayed
by
the
original
parent
when
danger
was
nigh
he
was
seen
afar
off
sailing
around
in
placid
unconcern
it
is
generally
known
that
when
either
the
wild
turkey
or
domestic
turkey
begins
to
lay
and
afterwards
to
sit
and
rear
the
brood
she
secludes
herself
from
the
male
who
then
very
sensibly
herds
with
others
of
his
sex
and
betakes
himself
to
haunts
of
his
own
till
male
and
female
old
and
young
meet
again
on
common
ground
late
in
the
fall
but
rob
the
sitting
bird
of
her
eggs
or
destroy
her
tender
young
and
she
immediately
sets
out
in
quest
of
a
male
who
is
no
laggard
when
he
hears
her
call
the
same
is
true
of
ducks
and
other
aquatic
fowls
the
propagating
instinct
is
strong
and
surmounts
all
ordinary
difficulties
no
doubt
the
widowhood
i
had
caused
in
the
case
of
the
woodpeckers
was
of
short
duration
and
chance
brought
or
the
widow
drummed
up
some
forlorn
male
who
was
not
dismayed
by
the
prospect
of
having
a
large
family
of
birds
on
his
hands
at
the
outset
i
have
seen
a
fine
cock
robin
paying
assiduous
addresses
to
a
female
bird
as
late
as
the
middle
of
july
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
his
intentions
were
honorable
i
watched
the
pair
for
half
an
hour
the
hen
i
took
it
was
in
the
market
for
the
second
time
that
season
but
the
cock
from
his
bright
unfaded
plumage
looked
like
a
new
arrival
the
hen
resented
every
advance
of
the
male
in
vain
he
strutted
around
her
and
displayed
his
fine
feathers
every
now
and
then
she
would
make
at
him
in
a
most
spiteful
manner
he
followed
her
to
the
ground
poured
into
her
ear
a
fine
warble
offered
her
a
worm
flew
back
to
the
tree
again
with
a
great
spread
of
plumage
hopped
around
her
on
the
branches
chirruped
chattered
flew
gallantly
at
an
intruder
and
was
back
in
an
instant
at
her
side
no
use
she
cut
him
short
at
every
turn
the
dénouement
i
can
not
relate
as
the
artful
bird
followed
by
her
ardent
suitor
soon
flew
away
beyond
my
sight
it
may
not
be
rash
to
conclude
however
that
she
held
out
no
longer
than
was
prudent
on
the
whole
there
seems
to
be
a
system
of
women
rights
prevailing
among
the
birds
which
contemplated
from
the
standpoint
of
the
male
is
quite
admirable
in
almost
all
cases
of
joint
interest
the
female
bird
is
the
most
active
she
determines
the
site
of
the
nest
and
is
usually
the
most
absorbed
in
its
construction
generally
she
is
more
vigilant
in
caring
for
the
young
and
manifests
the
most
concern
when
danger
threatens
hour
after
hour
i
have
seen
the
mother
of
a
brood
of
blue
grosbeaks
pass
from
the
nearest
meadow
to
the
tree
that
held
her
nest
with
a
cricket
or
grasshopper
in
her
bill
while
her
half
was
singing
serenely
on
a
distant
tree
or
pursuing
his
pleasure
amid
the
branches
yet
among
the
majority
of
our
the
male
is
most
conspicuous
both
by
his
color
and
manners
and
by
his
song
and
is
to
that
extent
a
shield
to
the
female
it
is
thought
that
the
female
is
humbler
clad
for
her
better
concealment
during
incubation
but
this
is
not
satisfactory
as
in
some
cases
she
is
relieved
from
time
to
time
by
the
male
in
the
case
of
the
domestic
dove
for
instance
promptly
at
midday
the
cock
is
found
upon
the
nest
i
should
say
that
the
dull
or
neutral
tints
of
the
female
were
a
provision
of
nature
for
her
greater
safety
at
all
times
as
her
life
is
far
more
precious
to
the
species
than
that
of
the
male
the
indispensable
office
of
the
male
reduces
itself
to
little
more
than
a
moment
of
time
while
that
of
his
mate
extends
over
days
and
weeks
if
not
months
footnote
footnote
a
recent
english
writer
upon
this
subject
presents
an
array
of
facts
and
considerations
that
do
not
support
this
view
he
says
that
with
very
few
exceptions
it
is
the
rule
that
when
both
sexes
are
of
strikingly
gay
and
conspicuous
colors
the
nest
is
such
as
to
conceal
the
sitting
bird
while
whenever
there
is
a
striking
contrast
of
colors
the
male
being
gay
and
conspicuous
the
female
dull
and
obscure
the
nest
is
open
and
sitting
bird
exposed
to
view
the
exceptions
to
this
rule
among
european
birds
appear
to
be
very
few
among
our
own
birds
the
cuckoos
and
the
blue
jays
build
open
nests
without
presenting
any
noticeable
difference
in
the
coloring
of
the
two
sexes
the
same
is
true
of
the
pewees
the
kingbird
and
the
sparrows
while
the
common
bluebird
the
oriole
and
the
orchard
starling
afford
examples
the
other
way
in
migrating
northward
the
males
have
abandoned
their
nests
or
rather
chambers
which
they
do
after
the
first
season
their
cousins
the
nuthatches
chickadees
and
brown
creepers
fall
heir
to
them
these
birds
especially
the
creepers
and
nuthatches
have
many
of
the
habits
of
the
picidae
but
lack
their
powers
of
bill
and
so
are
unable
to
excavate
a
nest
for
themselves
their
habitation
therefore
is
always
but
each
species
carries
in
some
soft
material
of
various
kinds
or
in
other
words
furnishes
the
tenement
to
its
liking
the
chickadee
arranges
in
the
bottom
of
the
cavity
a
little
mat
of
a
light
substance
which
looks
as
if
is
came
from
the
hatter
but
which
is
probably
the
work
of
numerous
worms
or
caterpillars
on
this
soft
lining
the
female
deposits
six
speckled
eggs
i
recently
discovered
one
of
these
nests
in
a
most
interesting
situation
the
tree
containing
it
a
variety
of
wild
cherry
stood
upon
the
brink
of
the
bald
summit
of
a
high
mountain
gray
timeworn
rocks
lay
piled
loosely
about
or
overtoppled
the
just
visible
byways
of
the
red
fox
the
trees
had
a
look
and
that
indescribable
wildness
which
lurks
about
the
tops
of
all
remote
mountains
possessed
the
place
standing
there
i
looked
down
upon
the
back
of
the
hawk
as
he
flew
out
over
the
earth
beneath
me
following
him
my
eye
also
took
in
farms
and
settlements
and
villages
and
other
mountain
ranges
that
grew
blue
in
the
distance
the
parent
birds
attracted
my
attention
by
appearing
with
food
in
their
beaks
and
by
seeming
much
put
out
yet
so
wary
were
they
of
revealing
the
locality
of
their
brood
or
even
of
the
precise
tree
that
held
them
that
i
lurked
around
over
an
hour
without
gaining
a
point
on
them
finally
a
bright
and
curious
boy
who
accompanied
me
secreted
himself
under
a
low
projected
rock
close
to
the
tree
in
which
we
supposed
the
nest
to
be
while
i
moved
off
around
the
it
was
not
long
before
the
youth
had
their
secret
the
tree
which
was
low
and
and
overrun
with
lichens
appeared
at
a
cursory
glance
to
contain
not
one
dry
or
decayed
limb
yet
there
was
one
a
few
feet
long
in
which
when
my
eyes
were
piloted
thither
i
detected
a
small
round
orifice
as
my
weight
began
to
shake
the
branches
the
consternation
of
both
old
and
young
was
great
the
stump
of
a
limb
that
held
the
nest
was
about
three
inches
thick
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
tunnel
was
excavated
quite
to
the
bark
with
my
thumb
i
broke
the
thin
wall
and
the
young
which
were
looked
out
upon
the
world
for
the
first
time
presently
one
of
them
with
a
significant
chirp
as
much
to
say
it
is
time
we
were
out
of
this
began
to
climb
up
toward
the
proper
entrance
placing
himself
in
the
hole
he
looked
around
without
manifesting
any
surprise
at
the
grand
scene
that
lay
spread
out
before
him
he
was
taking
his
bearings
and
determining
how
far
he
could
trust
the
power
of
his
untried
wings
to
take
him
out
of
harm
way
after
a
moment
pause
with
a
loud
chirrup
he
launched
out
and
made
tolerable
headway
the
others
rapidly
followed
each
one
as
it
started
upward
from
a
sudden
impulse
contemptuously
saluted
the
abandoned
nest
with
its
excrement
though
generally
regular
in
their
habits
and
instincts
yet
the
birds
sometimes
seem
as
whimsical
and
capricious
as
superior
beings
one
is
not
safe
for
instance
in
making
any
absolute
assertion
as
to
their
place
or
mode
of
building
often
get
up
into
a
bush
and
sometimes
get
upon
the
ground
or
into
a
tussock
of
grass
the
song
sparrow
which
is
a
ground
builder
has
been
known
to
build
in
the
knothole
of
a
fence
rail
and
a
chimney
swallow
once
got
tired
of
soot
and
smoke
and
fastened
its
nest
on
a
rafter
in
a
hay
barn
a
friend
tells
me
of
a
pair
of
barn
swallow
which
taking
a
fanciful
turn
saddled
their
nest
in
the
loop
of
a
rope
that
was
pendent
from
a
peg
in
the
peak
and
liked
it
so
well
that
they
repeated
the
experiment
next
year
i
have
know
the
social
sparrow
or
hairbird
to
build
under
a
shed
in
a
tuft
of
hay
that
hung
down
through
the
loose
flooring
from
the
mow
above
it
usually
contents
itself
with
half
a
dozen
stalks
of
dry
grass
and
a
few
long
hair
from
a
cow
tail
loosely
arranged
on
the
branch
of
an
the
swallow
builds
in
the
wall
and
in
old
and
i
have
seen
the
robin
build
in
similar
localities
others
have
found
its
nest
in
old
abandoned
wells
the
house
wren
will
build
in
anything
that
has
an
accessible
cavity
from
an
old
boot
to
a
bombshell
a
pair
of
them
once
persisted
in
building
their
nest
in
the
top
of
a
certain
getting
in
through
the
opening
above
the
handle
the
pump
being
in
daily
use
the
nest
was
destroyed
more
than
a
score
of
times
this
jealous
little
wretch
has
the
wise
forethought
when
the
box
in
which
he
builds
contains
two
compartments
to
fill
up
one
of
them
so
as
to
avoid
the
risk
of
troublesome
neighbors
the
less
skillful
builders
sometimes
depart
from
their
usual
habit
and
take
up
with
the
abandoned
nest
of
some
other
species
the
blue
jay
now
and
then
lays
in
an
old
crow
nest
or
cuckoo
nest
the
crow
blackbird
seized
with
a
fit
of
indolence
drops
its
eggs
in
the
cavity
of
a
decayed
branch
i
heard
of
a
cuckoo
that
dispossessed
a
robin
of
its
nest
of
another
that
set
a
blue
jay
adrift
large
loose
structures
like
the
nests
of
the
osprey
and
certain
of
the
herons
have
been
found
with
half
a
dozen
nests
of
the
blackbirds
set
in
the
outer
edges
like
so
many
parasites
or
as
audubon
says
like
the
retainers
about
the
rude
court
of
a
feudal
baron
the
same
birds
breeding
in
a
southern
climate
construct
far
less
elaborate
nests
than
when
breeding
in
a
northern
climate
certain
species
of
waterfowl
that
abandon
their
eggs
to
the
sand
and
the
sun
in
the
warmer
zones
build
a
nest
and
sit
in
the
usual
way
in
labrador
in
georgia
the
baltimore
oriole
places
its
nest
upon
the
north
side
of
the
tree
in
the
middle
and
eastern
states
it
fixes
it
upon
the
south
or
east
side
and
makes
it
much
thicker
and
warmer
i
have
seen
one
from
the
south
that
had
some
kind
of
coarse
reed
or
sedge
woven
into
it
giving
it
an
appearance
like
a
basket
very
few
species
use
the
same
material
uniformly
i
have
seen
the
nest
of
the
robin
quite
destitute
of
mud
in
one
instance
it
was
composed
mainly
of
long
black
arranged
in
a
circular
manner
with
a
lining
of
fine
yellow
grass
the
whole
presenting
quite
a
novel
appearance
in
another
case
the
nest
was
chiefly
constructed
of
a
species
of
rock
moss
the
nest
for
the
second
brood
during
the
same
season
is
often
a
mere
makeshift
the
haste
of
the
female
to
deposit
her
eggs
as
the
season
advances
seems
very
great
and
the
structure
is
apt
to
be
prematurely
finished
i
was
recently
reminded
of
this
fact
by
happening
about
the
last
of
july
to
meet
with
several
nests
of
the
wood
or
bush
sparrow
in
a
remote
blackberry
field
the
nests
with
eggs
were
far
less
elaborate
and
compact
than
the
earlier
nests
from
which
the
young
had
flown
day
after
day
as
i
go
to
a
certain
piece
of
woods
i
observe
a
male
sitting
on
precisely
the
same
part
of
a
high
branch
and
singing
in
his
most
vivacious
style
as
i
approach
he
ceases
to
sing
and
flirting
his
tail
right
and
left
with
marked
emphasis
chirps
sharply
in
a
low
bush
near
by
i
come
upon
the
object
of
his
solicitude
a
thick
compact
nest
composed
largely
of
dry
leaves
and
fine
grass
in
which
a
plain
brown
bird
is
sitting
upon
four
pale
blue
eggs
the
wonder
is
that
a
bird
will
leave
the
apparent
security
of
the
treetops
to
place
its
nest
in
the
way
of
the
many
dangers
that
walk
and
crawl
upon
the
ground
there
far
up
out
of
reach
sings
the
bird
here
not
three
feet
from
the
ground
are
its
eggs
or
helpless
young
the
truth
is
birds
are
the
greatest
enemies
of
birds
and
it
is
with
reference
to
this
fact
that
many
of
the
smaller
species
build
perhaps
the
greatest
proportion
of
birds
breed
along
highways
i
have
known
the
ruffed
grouse
to
come
out
of
a
dense
wood
and
make
its
nest
at
the
root
of
a
tree
within
ten
paces
of
the
road
where
no
doubt
hawks
and
crows
as
well
as
skunks
and
foxes
would
be
less
likely
to
find
it
out
traversing
remote
through
dense
woods
i
have
repeatedly
seen
the
veery
or
wilson
thrush
sitting
upon
her
nest
so
near
me
that
i
could
almost
take
her
from
it
by
stretching
out
my
hand
birds
of
prey
show
none
of
this
confidence
in
man
and
when
locating
their
nests
avoid
rather
than
seek
his
haunts
in
a
certain
locality
in
the
interior
of
new
york
i
know
every
season
where
i
am
sure
to
find
a
nest
or
two
of
the
snowbird
it
is
under
the
brink
of
a
low
mossy
bank
so
near
the
highway
that
it
could
be
reached
from
a
passing
vehicle
with
a
whip
every
horse
or
wagon
or
foot
passenger
disturbs
the
sitting
bird
she
awaits
the
near
approach
of
the
sound
of
feet
or
wheels
and
then
darts
quickly
across
the
road
barely
clearing
the
ground
and
disappears
amid
the
bushes
on
the
opposite
side
in
the
trees
that
line
one
of
the
main
streets
and
fashionable
drives
leading
our
of
washington
city
and
less
than
half
a
mile
from
the
boundary
i
have
counted
the
nests
of
five
different
species
at
one
time
and
that
without
any
very
close
scrutiny
of
the
foliage
while
in
many
acres
of
woodland
half
a
mile
off
i
searched
in
vain
for
a
single
nest
among
the
five
the
nest
that
interested
me
most
was
that
of
the
blue
grosbeak
here
this
bird
which
according
to
observations
in
louisiana
is
shy
and
recluse
affecting
remote
marshes
and
the
borders
of
large
ponds
of
stagnant
water
had
placed
its
nest
in
the
lowest
twig
of
the
lowest
branch
of
a
large
sycamore
immediately
over
a
great
thoroughfare
and
so
near
the
ground
that
a
person
standing
in
a
cart
or
sitting
on
a
horse
could
have
reached
it
with
his
hand
the
nest
was
composed
mainly
of
fragments
of
newspaper
and
stalks
of
grass
and
though
so
low
was
remarkably
well
concealed
by
one
of
the
peculiar
clusters
of
twigs
and
leaves
which
characterize
this
tree
the
nest
contained
young
when
i
discovered
it
and
though
the
parent
birds
were
much
annoyed
by
my
loitering
about
beneath
the
tree
they
paid
little
attention
to
the
stream
of
vehicles
that
was
constantly
passing
it
was
a
wonder
to
me
when
the
birds
could
have
built
it
for
they
are
much
shyer
when
building
than
at
any
other
times
no
doubt
they
worked
mostly
in
the
morning
having
the
early
hours
all
to
themselves
another
pair
of
blue
grosbeaks
built
in
a
graveyard
within
the
city
limits
the
nest
was
placed
in
a
low
bush
and
the
male
continued
to
sing
at
intervals
till
the
young
were
ready
to
fly
the
song
of
this
bird
is
a
rapid
intricate
warble
like
that
of
the
though
stronger
and
louder
indeed
these
two
birds
so
much
resemble
each
other
in
color
form
manner
voice
and
general
habits
that
were
it
not
for
the
difference
in
size
the
grosbeak
being
nearly
as
large
again
as
the
it
would
be
a
hard
matter
to
tell
them
apart
the
females
of
both
species
are
clad
in
the
same
suits
so
are
the
young
the
first
season
of
course
in
the
deep
primitive
woods
also
are
nests
but
how
rarely
we
find
them
the
simple
art
of
the
bird
consists
in
choosing
common
material
as
moss
dry
leaves
twigs
and
various
odds
and
ends
and
placing
the
structure
on
a
convenient
branch
where
it
blends
in
color
with
its
surroundings
but
how
consummate
is
this
art
and
how
skillfully
is
the
nest
concealed
we
occasionally
light
upon
it
but
who
unaided
by
the
movements
of
the
bird
could
find
it
out
during
the
present
season
i
went
to
the
woods
nearly
every
day
for
a
fortnight
without
making
any
discoveries
of
this
kind
till
one
day
paying
them
a
farewell
visit
i
chanced
to
come
upon
several
nests
a
black
and
white
creeping
warbler
suddenly
became
much
alarmed
as
i
was
approaching
a
crumbing
old
stump
in
a
dense
part
of
the
forest
he
alighted
upon
it
chirped
sharply
ran
up
and
down
its
sides
and
finally
left
it
with
much
reluctance
the
nest
which
contained
three
young
birds
nearly
fledged
was
placed
upon
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
stump
and
in
such
a
positions
that
the
color
of
the
young
harmonized
perfectly
with
the
bits
of
bark
sticks
lying
about
my
eye
rested
upon
them
for
the
second
time
before
i
made
them
out
they
hugged
the
nest
very
closely
but
as
i
put
down
my
hand
they
all
scampered
off
with
loud
cries
for
help
which
caused
the
parent
birds
to
place
themselves
almost
within
my
reach
the
nest
was
merely
a
little
dry
grass
arranged
in
a
thick
bed
of
dry
leaves
this
was
amid
a
thick
undergrowth
moving
on
into
a
passage
of
large
stately
hemlocks
with
only
here
and
there
a
small
beech
or
maple
rising
up
into
the
perennial
twilight
i
paused
to
make
out
a
note
which
was
entirely
new
to
me
it
is
still
in
my
ear
though
unmistakably
a
bird
note
it
yet
suggested
the
beating
of
a
tiny
lambkin
presently
the
birds
appeared
a
pair
of
the
solitary
vireo
they
came
flitting
from
point
to
point
alighting
only
for
a
moment
at
a
time
the
male
silent
but
the
female
uttering
this
strange
tender
note
it
was
a
rendering
into
some
new
sylvan
dialect
of
the
human
sentiment
of
maidenly
love
it
was
really
pathetic
in
its
sweetness
and
childlike
confidence
and
joy
i
soon
discovered
that
the
pair
were
building
a
nest
upon
a
low
branch
a
few
yards
from
me
the
male
flew
cautiously
to
the
spot
and
adjusted
something
and
the
twain
moved
on
the
female
calling
to
her
mate
at
intervals
with
a
cadence
and
tenderness
in
the
tone
that
rang
in
the
ear
long
afterward
the
nest
was
suspended
to
the
fork
of
a
small
branch
as
is
usual
with
the
vireos
plentifully
lined
with
lichens
and
bound
and
rebound
with
masses
of
coarse
there
was
no
attempt
at
concealment
except
in
the
neutral
tints
which
make
it
look
like
a
natural
growth
of
the
dim
gray
woods
continuing
my
random
walk
i
next
paused
in
a
low
part
of
the
woods
where
the
larger
trees
began
to
give
place
to
a
thick
that
covered
an
old
barkpeeling
i
was
standing
by
a
large
maple
when
a
small
bird
darted
quickly
away
from
it
as
if
it
might
have
come
out
of
a
hole
near
its
base
as
the
bird
paused
a
few
yards
from
me
and
began
to
chirp
uneasily
my
curiosity
was
at
once
excited
when
i
saw
it
was
the
female
mourning
ground
warbler
and
remembered
that
the
nest
of
this
bird
had
not
yet
been
seen
by
any
naturalist
that
not
even
dr
brewer
had
ever
seen
the
eggs
i
felt
that
here
was
something
worth
looking
for
so
i
carefully
began
the
search
exploring
inch
by
inch
the
ground
the
base
and
roots
of
the
tree
and
the
various
shrubby
growths
about
it
till
finding
nothing
and
fearing
i
might
really
put
my
foot
in
it
i
bethought
me
to
withdraw
to
a
distance
and
after
some
delay
return
again
and
thus
forewarned
note
the
exact
point
from
which
the
bird
flew
this
i
did
and
returning
had
little
difficulty
in
discovering
the
nest
it
was
placed
but
a
few
feet
from
the
maple
tree
in
a
bunch
of
ferns
and
about
six
inches
from
the
ground
it
was
quite
a
massive
nest
composed
entirely
of
the
stalks
and
leaves
of
dry
grass
with
an
inner
lining
of
fine
dark
brown
roots
the
eggs
three
in
number
were
of
light
uniformly
specked
with
fine
brown
specks
the
cavity
of
the
nest
was
so
deep
that
the
back
of
the
sitting
bird
sank
below
the
edge
in
the
top
of
a
tall
tree
a
short
distance
farther
on
i
saw
the
nest
of
the
hawk
a
large
mass
of
twigs
and
dry
sticks
the
young
had
flown
but
still
lingered
in
the
vicinity
and
as
i
approached
the
mother
bird
flew
about
over
me
squealing
in
a
very
angry
savage
manner
tufts
of
the
hair
and
other
indigestible
material
of
the
common
meadow
mouse
lay
around
on
the
ground
beneath
the
nest
as
i
was
about
leaving
the
woods
my
hat
almost
brushed
the
nest
of
the
vireo
which
hung
on
the
end
of
a
low
drooping
branch
of
the
beech
i
should
never
have
seen
it
had
the
bird
kept
her
place
it
contained
three
eggs
of
the
bird
own
and
one
of
the
cow
bunting
the
strange
egg
was
only
just
perceptibly
larger
than
the
others
yet
in
three
days
after
when
i
looked
into
the
nest
again
and
found
all
but
one
egg
hatched
the
young
interloper
was
at
least
four
times
as
large
as
either
of
the
others
and
with
such
a
superabundance
of
bowels
as
to
almost
smother
his
bedfellows
beneath
them
that
the
intruder
should
fare
the
same
as
the
rightful
occupants
and
thrive
with
them
was
more
than
ordinary
potluck
but
that
it
alone
should
thrive
devouring
as
it
were
all
the
rest
is
one
of
those
freaks
of
nature
in
which
she
would
seem
to
discourage
the
homely
virtues
of
prudence
and
honesty
weeds
and
parasites
have
the
odds
greatly
against
them
yet
they
wage
a
very
successful
war
nonetheless
the
woods
hold
not
such
another
gem
as
the
nest
of
the
hummingbird
the
finding
of
one
is
an
event
to
date
from
it
is
the
next
best
thing
to
finding
an
eagle
nest
i
have
met
with
but
two
both
by
chance
one
was
placed
on
the
horizontal
branch
of
a
with
a
solitary
green
leaf
forming
a
complete
canopy
about
an
inch
and
a
half
above
it
the
repeated
spiteful
dartings
of
the
bird
past
my
ears
as
i
stood
under
the
tree
caused
me
to
suspect
that
i
was
intruding
upon
some
one
privacy
and
following
it
with
my
eye
i
soon
saw
the
nest
which
was
in
process
of
construction
adopting
my
usual
tactics
of
secreting
myself
near
by
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
tiny
artist
at
work
it
was
the
female
unassisted
by
her
mate
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
minutes
she
would
appear
with
a
small
tuft
of
some
cottony
substance
in
her
beak
and
alighting
quickly
in
the
nest
arrange
the
material
she
had
brought
using
her
breast
as
a
model
the
other
nest
i
discovered
in
a
dense
forest
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
the
sitting
bird
was
disturbed
as
i
passed
beneath
her
the
whirring
of
her
wings
arrested
my
attention
when
after
a
short
pause
i
had
the
good
luck
to
see
through
an
opening
in
the
leaves
the
bird
return
to
her
nest
which
appeared
like
a
mere
wart
or
excrescence
an
a
small
branch
the
hummingbird
unlike
all
others
does
not
alight
upon
the
nest
but
flies
into
it
she
enters
it
as
quick
as
a
flash
but
as
light
as
any
feather
two
eggs
are
the
complement
they
are
perfectly
white
and
so
frail
that
only
a
fingers
may
touch
them
incubation
lasts
about
ten
days
in
a
week
the
young
have
flown
the
only
nest
like
the
hummingbirds
and
comparable
to
it
in
neatness
and
symmetry
is
that
of
the
gnatcatcher
this
is
often
saddled
upon
the
limb
in
the
same
manner
though
it
is
generally
more
or
less
pendent
it
is
deep
and
soft
composed
mostly
of
some
vegetable
down
covered
all
over
with
delicate
and
except
that
it
is
much
larger
appears
almost
identical
with
the
nest
of
the
hummingbird
but
the
nest
of
nests
the
ideal
nest
after
we
have
left
the
deep
woods
is
unquestionably
that
of
the
baltimore
oriole
it
is
the
only
perfectly
pensile
nest
we
have
the
nest
of
the
orchard
oriole
is
indeed
mainly
so
but
this
bird
generally
builds
lower
and
shallower
more
after
the
manner
of
the
vireos
the
baltimore
oriole
loves
to
attach
its
nest
to
the
swaying
branches
of
the
tallest
elms
making
no
attempt
at
concealment
but
satisfied
if
the
position
be
high
and
the
branch
pendant
this
nest
would
seem
to
cost
more
time
and
skill
than
any
other
bird
structure
a
peculiar
substance
seems
to
be
always
sought
after
and
always
found
the
nest
when
completed
assumes
the
form
of
a
large
suspended
gourd
the
walls
are
thin
but
firm
and
proof
against
the
most
driving
rain
the
mouth
is
hemmed
or
overhanded
with
and
the
sides
are
usually
sewed
through
and
through
with
the
same
not
particular
as
to
the
matter
of
secrecy
the
bird
is
not
particular
to
the
material
so
that
be
of
the
nature
of
the
strings
or
threads
a
lady
friend
once
told
me
that
while
working
by
an
open
window
one
of
these
birds
approaching
during
her
momentary
absence
and
seizing
a
skein
of
some
kind
of
thread
or
yarn
made
off
with
it
to
its
nest
but
the
perverse
yarn
caught
fast
in
the
branches
and
in
the
bird
effort
to
extricate
it
got
hopelessly
tangled
she
tugged
away
at
it
all
day
but
was
finally
obliged
to
content
herself
with
a
few
detached
portions
the
fluttering
stings
were
an
eyesore
to
her
ever
after
and
passing
and
repassing
she
would
give
them
a
spiteful
jerk
as
much
to
say
there
is
that
confounded
yarn
that
gave
me
so
much
trouble
from
pennsylvania
vincent
barnard
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
other
curious
facts
sent
me
this
interesting
story
of
an
oriole
he
says
a
friend
of
his
curious
in
such
things
on
observing
the
bird
beginning
to
build
hung
out
near
the
prospective
nest
skeins
of
zephyr
yarn
which
the
eager
artist
readily
appropriated
he
managed
it
so
that
the
bird
used
nearly
equal
quantities
of
various
high
bright
colors
the
nest
was
made
unusually
deep
and
capacious
and
it
may
be
questioned
if
such
a
thing
of
beauty
was
ever
before
woven
by
the
cunning
of
a
bird
nuttall
by
far
the
most
genial
of
american
ornithologists
relates
the
following
a
female
oriole
which
i
observed
attentively
carried
off
to
her
nest
a
piece
of
ten
or
twelve
feet
long
this
long
string
and
many
other
shorter
ones
were
left
hanging
out
for
a
week
before
both
ends
were
wattled
into
the
sides
of
the
nest
some
other
little
birds
making
use
of
similar
materials
at
times
twitched
these
flowing
ends
and
generally
brought
out
the
busy
baltimore
from
her
occupation
in
great
anger
i
may
perhaps
claim
indulgence
for
adding
a
little
more
of
the
biography
of
this
particular
bird
as
a
representative
also
of
the
instincts
of
her
race
she
completed
the
nest
in
about
a
weeks
time
without
any
aid
from
her
mate
who
indeed
appeared
but
seldom
in
her
company
and
was
now
become
nearly
silent
for
fibrous
materials
she
broke
hackled
and
gathered
the
flax
of
the
asclepias
and
hibiscus
stalks
tearing
off
long
strings
and
flying
with
them
to
the
scene
of
her
labors
she
appeared
very
eager
and
hasty
in
her
pursuits
and
collected
her
materials
without
fear
or
restraint
while
three
men
were
working
in
the
neighboring
walks
and
may
persons
were
visiting
the
garden
her
courage
and
perseverance
were
truly
admirable
if
watched
to
narrowly
she
saluted
with
her
usual
scolding
tshrr
tshrr
tshrr
seeing
no
reason
probably
why
she
should
be
interrupted
in
her
indispensable
occupation
though
the
males
were
now
comparatively
silent
on
the
arrival
of
their
busy
mates
i
could
not
help
observing
this
female
and
a
second
continually
vociferating
apparently
in
strife
at
last
she
was
observed
to
attack
this
second
female
very
fiercely
who
slyly
intruded
herself
at
times
into
the
same
tree
where
she
was
building
these
contests
were
angry
and
often
repeated
to
account
for
this
animosity
i
now
recollected
that
two
fine
males
had
been
killed
in
our
vicinity
and
i
therefore
concluded
the
intruder
to
be
left
without
a
mate
yet
she
had
gained
the
affections
of
the
consort
of
the
busy
female
and
thus
the
cause
of
their
jealous
quarrel
became
apparent
having
obtained
the
confidence
of
her
faithless
paramour
the
second
female
began
preparing
to
weave
a
nest
in
an
adjoining
elm
by
tying
together
certain
pendent
twigs
as
a
foundation
the
male
now
associated
chiefly
with
the
intruder
whom
he
even
assisted
in
her
labor
yet
did
not
wholly
forget
his
first
partner
who
called
on
him
one
evening
in
a
low
affectionate
tone
which
was
answered
in
the
same
strain
while
they
were
thus
engaged
in
friendly
whispers
suddenly
appeared
the
rival
and
a
violent
rencontre
ensued
so
that
one
of
the
females
appeared
to
be
greatly
agitated
and
fluttered
with
spreading
wings
as
if
considerably
hurt
the
male
though
prudently
neutral
in
the
contest
showed
his
culpable
partiality
by
flying
off
with
his
paramour
and
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
left
the
tree
to
his
pugnacious
consort
cares
of
another
kind
more
imperious
and
tender
at
length
reconciled
or
at
least
terminated
these
disputes
with
the
jealous
females
and
by
the
aid
of
the
neighboring
bachelors
who
are
never
wanting
among
these
and
other
birds
peace
was
at
length
completely
restored
by
the
restitution
of
the
quiet
and
happy
condition
of
monogamy
let
me
not
forget
to
mention
the
nest
under
the
mountain
ledge
the
nest
of
the
common
pewee
a
modest
mossy
structure
with
four
eggs
looking
out
upon
some
wild
scene
and
overhung
by
beetling
crags
after
all
has
been
said
about
the
elaborate
structures
few
nests
perhaps
awaken
more
pleasant
emotions
in
the
mind
of
the
beholder
than
this
of
the
pewee
the
gray
silent
rocks
with
caverns
and
dens
where
the
fox
and
the
wolf
lurk
and
just
out
of
their
reach
in
a
little
niche
as
if
it
grew
there
the
mossy
tenement
nearly
every
high
projecting
rock
in
any
range
has
one
of
these
nests
following
a
trout
stream
up
a
wild
mountain
gorge
not
long
since
i
counted
five
in
the
distance
of
a
mile
all
within
easy
reach
but
safe
from
the
minks
and
the
skunks
and
well
housed
from
the
storms
in
my
native
town
i
know
a
pine
and
oak
clad
hill
with
a
bold
precipitous
front
extending
halfway
around
it
near
the
top
and
along
this
front
or
side
there
crops
out
a
ledge
of
rocks
unusually
high
and
cavernous
one
immense
layer
projects
many
feet
allowing
a
person
or
many
persons
standing
upright
to
move
freely
beneath
it
there
is
a
delicious
spring
of
water
there
and
plenty
of
wild
cool
air
the
floor
is
of
loose
stone
now
trod
by
sheep
and
foxes
once
by
indian
and
wolf
how
i
have
delighted
from
boyhood
to
spend
a
summer
day
in
this
retreat
or
take
refuge
there
from
a
sudden
shower
always
the
freshness
and
coolness
and
always
the
delicate
mossy
nest
of
the
the
bird
keeps
her
place
till
you
are
within
a
few
feet
of
her
when
she
flits
to
a
near
branch
and
with
many
oscillations
of
her
tale
observes
you
anxiously
since
the
country
has
become
settled
this
pewee
has
fallen
into
the
strange
practice
of
occasionally
placing
its
nest
under
a
bridge
hayshed
or
other
artificial
structure
where
it
is
subject
to
all
kinds
of
interruptions
and
annoyances
when
placed
thus
the
nest
is
larger
and
coarser
i
know
a
beneath
which
a
pair
has
regularly
placed
its
nest
for
several
successive
seasons
arranged
along
on
a
single
pole
which
sags
down
a
few
inches
from
the
flooring
it
was
intended
to
help
support
are
three
of
these
structures
marking
the
number
of
years
the
birds
have
nested
there
the
foundation
is
of
mud
with
a
superstructure
of
moss
elaborately
lined
with
hair
and
feathers
nothing
can
be
more
perfect
and
exquisite
than
the
interior
of
one
of
these
nests
yet
a
new
one
is
built
every
season
three
broods
however
are
frequently
reared
in
it
the
pewees
as
a
class
are
the
best
architects
we
have
the
kingbird
builds
a
nest
altogether
admirable
using
various
soft
cotton
and
woolen
substances
and
sparing
neither
time
nor
material
to
make
it
substantial
and
warm
the
pewee
builds
its
nest
in
many
instances
wholly
of
the
blossoms
of
the
white
oak
the
wood
pewee
builds
a
neat
compact
nest
of
moss
and
lichens
on
a
horizontal
branch
there
is
never
a
loose
end
or
shred
about
it
the
sitting
bird
is
largely
visible
above
the
rim
she
moves
her
head
freely
about
and
seems
entirely
at
her
ease
a
circumstance
which
i
have
never
observed
in
any
other
species
the
nest
of
the
flycatcher
is
seldom
free
from
snake
skins
three
or
four
being
sometimes
woven
into
it
about
the
thinnest
shallowest
nest
for
its
situation
that
can
be
found
is
that
of
the
a
few
sticks
and
straws
are
carelessly
thrown
together
hardly
sufficient
to
prevent
the
eggs
form
falling
through
or
rolling
off
the
nest
of
the
passenger
pigeon
is
equally
hasty
and
insufficient
and
the
squabs
often
fall
to
the
ground
and
perish
the
other
extreme
among
our
common
birds
is
furnished
by
the
ferruginous
thrush
which
collects
together
a
mass
of
material
that
would
fill
a
measure
or
by
the
fish
hawk
which
adds
to
and
repairs
its
nest
year
after
year
till
the
whole
would
make
a
cart
load
one
of
the
rarest
of
nests
is
that
of
the
eagle
because
the
eagle
is
one
of
the
rarest
of
birds
indeed
so
seldom
is
the
eagle
seen
that
its
presence
always
seems
accidental
it
appears
as
if
merely
pausing
on
the
way
while
bound
for
some
distant
unknown
region
one
september
while
a
youth
i
saw
the
eagle
the
young
of
the
golden
eagle
an
immense
dusky
bird
the
sight
of
which
filled
me
with
awe
it
lingered
about
the
hills
for
two
days
some
young
cattle
a
colt
and
half
a
dozen
sheep
were
at
pasture
on
a
high
ridge
that
led
up
to
the
mountain
and
in
plain
view
of
the
house
on
the
second
day
this
dusky
monarch
was
seen
flying
about
above
them
presently
he
began
to
hover
over
them
after
the
manner
of
a
hawk
watching
for
mice
he
then
with
extended
legs
let
himself
slowly
down
upon
them
actually
grappling
the
backs
of
the
young
cattle
and
frightening
the
creatures
so
that
they
rushed
about
the
field
in
great
consternation
and
finally
as
he
grew
bolder
and
more
frequent
in
his
descents
the
whole
herd
broke
over
the
fence
and
came
tearing
down
to
the
house
like
mad
it
did
not
seem
to
be
an
assault
with
intent
to
kill
but
was
perhaps
a
stratagem
resorted
to
in
order
to
separate
the
herd
and
expose
the
lambs
which
hugged
the
cattle
very
closely
when
he
occasionally
alighted
upon
the
oaks
that
stood
near
the
branch
could
be
seen
to
sway
and
bend
beneath
him
finally
as
a
rifleman
started
out
in
pursuit
of
him
he
launched
into
the
air
set
his
wings
and
sailed
away
southward
a
few
years
afterward
in
january
another
eagle
passed
through
the
same
locality
alighting
in
a
field
near
some
dead
animal
but
tarried
briefly
so
much
by
way
of
identification
the
golden
eagle
is
common
to
the
northern
parts
of
both
hemispheres
and
places
its
eyrie
on
high
precipitous
rocks
a
pair
built
on
an
inaccessible
shelf
of
rock
along
the
hudson
for
eight
successive
years
a
squad
of
revolutionary
soldiers
also
as
related
by
audubon
found
a
nest
along
this
river
and
had
an
adventure
with
the
bird
that
came
near
costing
one
of
their
number
his
life
his
comrades
let
him
down
by
a
rope
to
secure
the
eggs
or
young
when
he
was
attacked
by
the
female
eagle
with
such
fury
that
he
was
obliged
to
defend
himself
with
his
knife
in
doing
so
by
a
misstroke
he
nearly
severed
the
rope
that
held
him
and
was
drawn
up
by
a
single
strand
from
his
perilous
position
the
bald
eagle
also
builds
on
high
rocks
according
to
audubon
though
wilson
describes
the
nest
of
one
which
he
saw
near
great
egg
harbor
in
the
top
of
a
large
yellow
pine
it
was
a
vast
pile
of
sticks
sods
sedge
grass
reeds
five
or
six
feet
high
by
four
broad
and
with
little
or
no
concavity
it
had
been
used
for
many
years
and
he
was
told
that
the
eagles
made
it
a
sort
of
home
or
in
all
seasons
the
eagle
in
all
cases
uses
one
nest
with
more
or
less
repair
for
several
years
many
of
our
common
birds
do
the
same
the
birds
may
be
divided
with
respect
to
this
and
kindred
points
into
five
general
classes
first
those
that
repair
or
appropriate
the
last
year
nest
as
the
wren
swallow
bluebird
flycatcher
owls
eagles
fish
hawk
and
a
few
others
secondly
those
that
build
anew
each
season
though
frequently
rearing
more
than
one
brood
in
the
same
nest
of
these
the
is
a
example
thirdly
those
that
build
a
new
nest
for
each
brood
which
includes
by
far
the
greatest
number
of
species
fourthly
a
limited
number
that
make
no
nest
of
their
own
but
appropriate
the
abandoned
nests
of
other
birds
finally
those
who
use
no
nest
at
all
but
deposit
their
eggs
in
the
sand
which
is
the
case
with
a
large
number
of
aquatic
fowls
v
spring
at
the
capital
with
an
eye
to
the
birds
i
came
to
washington
to
live
in
the
fall
of
and
with
the
exception
of
a
month
each
summer
spent
in
the
interior
of
new
york
have
lived
here
ever
since
i
saw
my
first
novelty
in
natural
history
the
day
after
my
arrival
as
i
was
walking
near
some
woods
north
of
the
city
a
grasshopper
of
prodigious
size
flew
up
from
the
ground
and
alighted
in
a
tree
as
i
pursued
him
he
proved
to
be
nearly
as
wild
and
as
fleet
of
wing
as
a
bird
i
thought
i
had
reached
the
capital
of
grasshopperdom
and
that
this
was
perhaps
one
of
the
chiefs
or
leaders
or
perhaps
the
great
high
cock
himself
taking
an
airing
in
the
fields
i
have
never
yet
been
able
to
settle
the
question
as
every
fall
i
start
up
a
few
of
these
gigantic
specimens
which
perch
on
the
trees
they
are
about
three
inches
long
of
a
gray
striped
or
spotted
color
and
have
quite
a
reptile
look
the
greatest
novelty
i
found
however
was
the
superb
autumn
weather
the
bright
strong
electric
days
lasting
well
into
november
and
the
general
mildness
of
the
entire
winter
though
the
mercury
occasionally
sinks
to
zero
yet
the
earth
is
never
so
seared
and
blighted
by
the
cold
but
that
in
some
sheltered
nook
or
corner
signs
of
vegetable
life
still
remain
which
on
a
little
encouragement
even
asserts
itself
i
have
found
wild
flowers
here
every
month
of
the
year
violets
in
december
a
single
houstonia
in
january
the
little
lump
of
earth
upon
which
it
stood
was
frozen
hard
and
a
tiny
plant
with
a
flower
almost
microscopic
in
its
smallness
growing
along
graveled
walks
and
in
old
plowed
fields
in
february
the
liverwort
sometimes
comes
out
as
early
as
the
first
week
in
march
and
the
little
frogs
begin
to
pipe
doubtfully
about
the
same
time
are
usually
in
bloom
on
day
and
the
on
may
day
by
august
mother
hen
will
lead
forth
her
third
brood
and
i
had
a
march
pullet
that
came
off
with
a
family
of
her
own
in
september
our
calendar
is
made
for
this
climate
march
is
a
spring
month
one
is
quite
sure
to
see
some
marked
and
striking
change
during
the
first
eight
or
ten
days
this
season
is
a
backward
one
and
the
memorable
change
did
not
come
till
the
then
the
sun
rose
up
from
a
bed
of
vapors
and
seemed
fairly
to
dissolve
with
tenderness
and
warmth
for
an
hour
or
two
the
air
was
perfectly
motionless
and
full
of
low
humming
awakening
sounds
the
naked
trees
had
a
rapt
expectant
look
from
some
unreclaimed
common
near
by
came
the
first
strain
of
the
song
sparrow
so
homely
because
so
old
and
familiar
yet
so
inexpressibly
pleasing
presently
a
full
chorus
of
voices
arose
tender
musical
half
suppressed
but
full
of
genuine
hilarity
and
joy
the
bluebird
warbled
the
robin
called
the
snowbird
chattered
the
meadowlark
uttered
her
strong
but
tender
note
over
a
deserted
field
a
turkey
buzzard
hovered
low
and
alighted
on
a
stake
in
the
fence
standing
a
moment
with
outstretched
vibrating
wings
till
he
was
sure
of
his
hold
a
soft
warm
brooding
day
roads
becoming
dry
in
many
places
and
looking
so
good
after
the
mud
and
the
snow
i
walk
up
beyond
the
boundary
and
over
meridian
hill
to
move
along
the
drying
road
and
feel
the
delicious
warmth
is
enough
the
cattle
low
long
and
loud
and
look
wistfully
into
the
distance
i
sympathize
with
them
never
a
spring
comes
but
i
have
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
depart
some
nomadic
or
migrating
instinct
or
reminiscence
stirs
within
me
i
ache
to
be
off
as
i
pass
along
the
calls
in
the
distance
precisely
as
i
have
heard
him
in
the
north
after
a
pause
he
repeats
his
summons
what
can
be
more
welcome
to
the
ear
than
these
early
first
sounds
they
have
such
a
margin
of
silence
one
need
but
pass
the
boundary
of
washington
city
to
be
fairly
in
the
country
and
ten
minutes
walk
in
the
country
brings
one
to
real
primitive
woods
the
town
has
not
yet
overflowed
its
limits
like
the
great
northern
commercial
capitals
and
nature
wild
and
unkempt
comes
up
to
its
very
threshold
and
even
in
many
places
crosses
it
the
woods
which
i
soon
reach
are
stark
and
still
the
signs
of
returning
life
are
so
faint
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
but
there
is
a
fresh
earthy
smell
in
the
air
as
if
something
had
stirred
here
under
the
leaves
the
crows
caw
above
the
wood
or
walk
about
the
brown
fields
i
look
at
the
gray
silent
trees
long
and
long
but
they
show
no
sign
the
catkins
of
some
alders
by
a
little
pool
have
just
swelled
perceptibly
and
brushing
away
the
dry
leaves
and
débris
on
a
sunny
slope
i
discover
the
liverwort
just
pushing
up
a
fuzzy
tender
sprout
but
the
waters
have
brought
forth
the
little
frogs
are
musical
from
every
marsh
and
pool
goes
up
their
shrill
but
pleasing
chorus
peering
into
one
of
their
haunts
a
little
body
of
water
i
discover
masses
of
frogs
spawn
covering
the
bottom
i
take
up
great
chunks
of
the
cold
quivering
jelly
in
my
hands
in
some
places
there
are
gallons
of
it
a
youth
who
accompanies
me
wonders
if
it
would
not
be
good
cooked
or
if
it
could
not
be
used
as
a
substitute
for
eggs
it
is
a
perfect
jelly
of
a
slightly
milky
tinge
thickly
imbedded
with
black
spots
about
the
size
of
a
small
bird
eye
when
just
deposited
it
is
perfectly
transparent
these
hatch
in
eight
or
ten
days
gradually
absorb
their
gelatinous
surroundings
and
the
tiny
tadpoles
issue
forth
in
the
city
even
before
the
have
caught
the
inspiration
spring
is
heralded
by
the
silver
poplars
which
line
all
the
streets
and
avenues
after
a
few
mild
sunshiny
march
days
you
suddenly
perceive
a
change
has
come
over
the
trees
their
tops
have
a
less
naked
look
if
the
weather
continues
warm
a
single
day
will
work
wonders
presently
each
tree
will
be
one
vast
plume
of
gray
downy
tassels
while
not
the
least
speck
of
green
foliage
is
visible
the
first
week
of
april
these
long
mimic
caterpillars
lie
all
about
the
streets
and
fill
the
gutters
the
approach
of
spring
is
also
indicated
by
the
crows
and
buzzards
which
rapidly
multiply
in
the
environs
of
the
city
and
grow
bold
and
demonstrative
the
crows
are
abundant
here
all
winter
but
are
not
very
noticeable
except
as
they
pass
high
in
air
to
and
from
their
winter
quarters
in
the
virginia
woods
early
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
it
is
light
enough
to
discern
them
there
they
are
streaming
eastward
across
the
sky
now
in
loose
scattered
flocks
now
in
thick
dense
masses
then
singly
and
in
pairs
or
triplets
but
all
setting
in
one
direction
probably
to
the
waters
of
eastern
maryland
toward
night
they
begin
to
return
flying
in
the
same
manner
and
directing
their
course
to
the
wooded
heights
on
the
potomac
west
of
the
city
in
spring
these
diurnal
mass
movements
cease
the
clan
breaks
up
the
rookery
is
abandoned
and
the
birds
scatter
broadcast
over
the
land
this
seems
to
be
the
course
everywhere
pursued
one
would
think
that
when
food
was
scarcest
the
policy
of
separating
into
small
bands
or
pairs
and
dispersing
over
a
wide
country
would
prevail
as
a
few
might
subsist
where
a
larger
number
would
starve
the
truth
is
however
that
in
winter
food
can
be
had
only
in
certain
clearly
defined
districts
and
tracts
as
along
rivers
and
the
shores
of
bays
and
lakes
a
few
miles
north
of
newburgh
on
the
hudson
the
crows
go
into
winter
quarters
in
the
same
manner
flying
south
in
the
morning
and
returning
again
at
night
sometimes
hugging
the
hills
so
close
during
a
strong
wind
as
to
expose
themselves
to
the
clubs
and
stones
of
schoolboys
ambushed
behind
trees
and
fences
the
belated
ones
that
come
laboring
along
just
at
dusk
are
often
so
overcome
by
the
long
journey
and
the
strong
current
that
they
seem
almost
on
the
point
of
sinking
down
whenever
the
wind
or
a
rise
in
the
ground
calls
upon
them
for
an
extra
effort
the
turkey
buzzards
are
noticeable
about
washington
as
soon
as
the
season
begins
to
open
sailing
leisurely
along
two
or
three
hundred
feet
overhead
or
sweeping
low
over
some
common
or
open
space
where
perchance
a
dead
puppy
or
pig
or
fowl
has
been
thrown
half
a
dozen
will
sometimes
alight
about
some
object
out
on
the
commons
and
with
their
broad
dusky
wings
lifted
up
to
their
full
extent
threaten
and
chase
each
other
while
perhaps
one
or
two
are
feeding
their
wings
are
very
large
and
flexible
and
the
slightest
motion
of
them
while
the
bird
stands
upon
the
ground
suffices
to
lift
its
feet
clear
their
movements
when
in
the
air
are
very
majestic
and
beautiful
to
the
eye
being
in
every
respect
identical
with
those
of
our
common
hen
or
hawk
they
sail
along
in
the
same
calm
effortless
interminable
manner
and
sweep
around
in
the
same
ample
spiral
the
shape
of
their
wings
and
tail
indeed
their
entire
effect
against
the
sky
except
in
size
and
color
is
very
nearly
the
same
as
that
of
the
hawk
mentioned
a
dozen
at
a
time
may
often
be
seen
high
in
air
amusing
themselves
by
sailing
serenely
round
and
round
in
the
same
circle
they
are
less
active
and
vigilant
than
the
hawk
never
poise
themselves
on
the
wing
never
dive
and
gambol
in
the
air
and
never
swoop
down
upon
their
prey
unlike
the
hawks
also
they
appear
to
have
no
enemies
the
crow
fights
the
hawk
and
the
kingbird
and
the
crow
blackbird
fight
the
crow
but
neither
takes
any
notice
of
the
buzzard
he
excites
the
enmity
of
none
for
the
reason
that
he
molests
none
the
crow
has
an
old
grudge
against
the
hawk
because
the
hawk
robs
the
crow
nest
and
carries
off
his
young
the
kingbird
quarrel
with
the
crow
is
upon
the
same
grounds
but
the
buzzard
never
attacks
live
game
or
feeds
upon
new
flesh
when
old
can
be
had
in
may
like
the
crows
they
nearly
all
disappear
very
suddenly
probably
to
their
near
the
seashore
do
the
males
separate
from
the
females
at
this
time
and
go
by
themselves
at
any
rate
in
july
i
discovered
that
a
large
number
of
buzzards
roosted
in
some
woods
near
rock
creek
about
a
mile
from
the
city
limits
and
as
they
do
not
nest
anywhere
in
this
vicinity
i
thought
they
might
be
males
i
happened
to
be
detained
late
in
the
woods
watching
the
nest
of
a
flying
squirrel
when
the
buzzards
just
after
sundown
began
to
come
by
ones
and
twos
and
alight
in
the
trees
near
me
presently
they
came
in
greater
numbers
but
from
the
same
direction
flapping
low
over
the
woods
and
taking
up
their
position
in
the
middle
branches
on
alighting
each
one
would
blow
very
audibly
through
his
nose
just
as
a
cow
does
when
she
lies
down
this
is
the
only
sound
i
have
ever
heard
the
buzzard
make
they
would
then
stretch
themselves
after
the
manner
of
turkeys
and
walk
along
the
limbs
sometimes
a
decayed
branch
would
break
under
the
weight
of
two
or
three
when
with
a
great
flapping
the
would
take
up
new
positions
they
continued
to
come
till
it
was
quite
dark
and
all
the
trees
about
me
were
full
i
began
to
feel
a
little
nervous
but
kept
my
place
after
it
was
entirely
dark
and
all
was
still
i
gathered
a
large
pile
of
dry
leaves
and
kindled
it
with
a
match
to
see
what
they
would
think
of
a
fire
not
a
sound
was
heard
till
the
pile
of
leaves
was
in
full
blaze
when
instantaneously
every
buzzard
started
i
thought
the
treetops
were
coming
down
upon
me
so
great
was
the
uproar
but
the
woods
were
soon
cleared
and
the
loathsome
pack
disappeared
in
the
night
about
the
of
june
i
saw
numbers
of
buzzards
sailing
around
over
the
great
falls
of
the
potomac
a
glimpse
of
the
birds
usually
found
here
in
the
latter
part
of
winter
may
be
had
in
the
following
extract
which
i
take
from
my
diary
under
date
of
february
made
a
long
excursion
through
the
woods
and
over
the
hills
went
directly
north
from
the
capitol
for
about
three
miles
the
ground
bare
and
the
day
cold
and
sharp
in
the
suburbs
among
the
scattered
irish
and
negro
shanties
came
suddenly
upon
a
flock
of
birds
feeding
about
like
our
northern
snow
buntings
every
now
and
then
they
uttered
a
piping
disconsolate
note
as
if
they
had
a
very
sorry
time
of
it
they
proved
to
be
shore
larks
the
first
i
had
ever
seen
they
had
the
walk
characteristic
of
all
larks
were
a
little
larger
than
the
sparrow
had
a
black
spot
on
the
breast
with
much
white
on
the
under
parts
of
their
bodies
as
i
approached
them
the
nearer
ones
paused
and
half
squatting
eyed
me
suspiciously
presently
at
a
movement
of
my
arm
away
they
went
flying
exactly
like
the
snow
bunting
and
showing
nearly
as
much
white
i
have
since
discovered
that
the
shore
lark
is
a
regular
visitant
here
in
february
and
march
when
large
quantities
of
them
are
shot
or
trapped
and
exposed
for
sale
in
the
market
during
a
heavy
snow
i
have
seen
numbers
of
them
feeding
upon
the
seeds
of
various
weedy
growths
in
a
large
well
into
town
pressing
on
the
walk
became
exhilarating
followed
a
little
brook
the
eastern
branch
of
the
tiber
lined
with
bushes
and
a
rank
growth
of
sparrows
started
out
here
and
there
and
flew
across
the
little
bends
and
points
among
some
pines
just
beyond
the
boundary
saw
a
number
of
american
goldfinches
in
their
gray
winter
dress
pecking
the
pinecones
a
kinglet
was
there
also
a
little
tuft
of
gray
feathers
hopping
about
as
restless
as
a
spirit
had
the
old
food
delicate
enough
for
him
also
farther
on
in
some
low
open
woods
saw
many
sparrows
the
fox
the
canada
the
song
the
swamp
all
herding
together
along
the
warm
and
sheltered
borders
to
my
surprise
saw
a
chewink
also
and
the
warbler
the
purple
finch
was
there
likewise
and
the
carolina
wren
and
brown
creeper
in
the
higher
colder
woods
not
a
bird
was
to
be
seen
returning
near
sunset
across
the
eastern
slope
of
a
hill
which
overlooked
the
city
was
delighted
to
see
a
number
of
grass
finches
or
vesper
sparrows
birds
which
will
be
forever
associated
in
my
mind
with
my
father
sheep
pastures
they
ran
before
me
now
flitting
a
pace
or
two
now
skulking
in
the
low
stubble
just
as
i
had
observed
them
when
a
boy
a
month
later
march
is
this
note
after
the
second
memorable
inaguration
of
president
lincoln
took
my
first
trip
of
the
season
the
afternoon
was
very
clear
and
warm
real
vernal
sunshine
at
last
though
the
wind
roared
like
a
lion
over
the
woods
it
seemed
novel
enough
to
find
within
two
miles
of
the
white
house
a
simple
woodsman
chopping
away
as
if
no
president
was
being
inaugurated
some
puppies
snugly
nestled
in
the
cavity
of
an
old
hollow
tree
he
said
belonged
to
a
wild
dog
i
imagine
i
saw
the
dog
on
the
other
side
of
rock
creek
in
a
great
state
of
grief
and
trepidation
running
up
and
down
crying
and
yelping
and
looking
wistfully
over
the
swollen
flood
which
the
poor
thing
had
not
the
courage
to
brave
this
day
for
the
first
time
i
heard
the
song
of
the
canada
sparrow
a
soft
sweet
note
almost
running
into
a
warble
saw
a
small
black
velvety
butterfly
with
a
yellow
border
to
its
wings
under
a
warm
bank
found
two
flowers
of
the
houstonia
in
bloom
saw
frogs
spawn
near
piny
branch
and
heard
the
hyla
among
the
first
birds
that
make
their
appearance
in
washington
is
the
crow
blackbird
he
may
come
any
time
after
the
of
march
the
birds
congregate
in
large
flocks
and
frequent
groves
and
parks
alternately
swarming
in
the
treetops
and
filling
the
air
with
their
sharp
jangle
and
alighting
on
the
ground
in
quest
of
food
their
polished
coats
glistening
in
the
sun
from
very
blackness
as
they
walk
about
there
is
evidently
some
music
in
the
soul
of
this
bird
at
this
season
though
he
makes
a
sad
failure
in
getting
it
out
his
voice
always
sounds
as
if
he
were
laboring
under
a
severe
attack
of
influenza
though
a
large
flock
of
them
heard
at
a
distance
on
a
bright
afternoon
of
early
spring
produce
an
effect
not
unpleasing
the
air
is
filled
with
crackling
splintering
spurting
sounds
which
are
like
pepper
and
salt
to
the
ear
all
parks
and
public
grounds
about
the
city
are
full
of
blackbirds
they
are
especially
plentiful
in
the
trees
about
the
white
house
breeding
there
and
waging
war
on
all
other
birds
the
occupants
of
one
of
the
offices
in
the
west
wing
of
the
treasury
one
day
had
their
attention
attracted
by
some
object
striking
violently
against
one
of
the
looking
up
they
beheld
a
crow
blackbird
pausing
in
midair
a
few
feet
from
the
window
on
the
broad
stone
lay
the
quivering
form
of
a
purple
finch
the
little
tragedy
was
easily
read
the
blackbird
had
pursued
the
finch
with
such
murderous
violence
that
the
latter
in
its
desperate
efforts
to
escape
had
sought
refuge
in
the
treasury
the
force
of
the
concussion
against
the
heavy
plateglass
of
the
window
had
killed
the
poor
thing
instantly
the
pursuer
no
doubt
astonished
at
the
sudden
and
novel
termination
of
the
career
of
its
victim
hovered
for
a
moment
as
if
to
be
sure
of
what
had
happened
and
made
off
it
is
not
unusual
for
birds
when
thus
threatened
with
destruction
by
their
natural
enemy
to
become
so
terrified
as
to
seek
safety
in
the
presence
of
man
i
was
once
startled
while
living
in
a
country
village
to
behold
on
entering
my
room
at
noon
one
october
day
a
quail
sitting
upon
my
bed
the
affrighted
and
bewildered
bird
instantly
started
for
the
open
window
into
which
it
had
no
doubt
been
driven
by
a
hawk
the
crow
blackbird
has
all
the
natural
cunning
of
his
prototype
the
crow
in
one
of
the
inner
courts
of
the
treasury
building
there
is
a
fountain
with
several
trees
growing
near
by
midsummer
the
blackbirds
became
so
bold
as
to
venture
within
this
court
various
fragments
of
food
tossed
from
the
surrounding
windows
reward
their
temerity
when
a
crust
of
dry
bread
defies
their
beaks
they
have
been
seen
to
drop
it
into
the
water
and
when
it
has
become
soaked
sufficiently
to
take
it
out
again
they
build
a
nest
of
coarse
sticks
and
mud
the
whole
burden
of
the
enterprise
seeming
to
devolve
upon
the
female
for
several
successive
mornings
just
after
sunrise
i
used
to
notice
a
pair
of
them
flying
to
and
fro
in
the
air
above
me
as
i
hoed
in
the
garden
directing
their
course
about
half
a
mile
distant
and
disappearing
on
their
return
among
the
trees
about
the
capitol
returning
the
female
always
had
her
beak
loaded
with
building
material
while
the
male
carrying
nothing
seemed
to
act
as
her
escort
flying
a
little
above
and
in
advance
of
her
and
uttering
now
and
then
his
husky
discordant
note
as
i
tossed
a
lump
of
earth
up
at
them
the
frightened
mother
bird
dropped
her
mortar
and
the
pair
scurried
away
much
put
out
later
they
avenged
themselves
by
pilfering
my
cherries
the
most
mischievous
enemies
of
the
cherries
however
here
as
at
the
north
are
the
cedar
waxwings
or
how
quickly
they
spy
out
the
tree
long
before
the
cherry
begins
to
turn
they
are
around
alert
and
cautious
in
small
flocks
they
circle
about
high
in
the
air
uttering
their
fine
note
or
plunge
quickly
into
the
tops
of
remote
trees
day
by
day
they
approach
nearer
and
nearer
reconnoitring
the
premises
and
watching
the
growing
fruit
hardly
have
the
green
lobes
turned
a
red
cheek
to
the
sun
before
their
beaks
have
scarred
it
at
first
they
approach
the
tree
stealthily
on
the
side
turned
from
the
house
diving
quickly
into
the
branches
in
ones
and
twos
while
the
main
flock
is
ambushed
in
some
shade
tree
not
far
off
they
are
most
apt
to
commit
their
depredations
very
early
in
the
morning
and
on
cloudy
rainy
days
as
the
cherries
grow
sweeter
the
birds
grow
bolder
till
from
throwing
tufts
of
grass
one
has
to
throw
stones
in
good
earnest
or
lose
all
his
fruit
in
june
they
disappear
following
the
cherries
to
the
north
where
by
july
they
are
nesting
in
the
orchards
and
cedar
groves
among
the
permanent
summer
residents
here
one
might
say
city
residents
as
they
seem
more
abundant
in
town
than
out
the
yellow
warbler
or
summer
yellowbird
is
conspicuous
he
comes
about
the
middle
of
april
and
seems
particularly
attached
to
the
silver
poplars
in
every
street
and
all
day
long
one
may
hear
his
thin
sharp
warble
when
nesting
the
female
comes
about
the
yard
pecking
at
the
and
gathering
up
bits
of
thread
to
weave
into
her
nest
swallows
appear
in
washington
form
the
first
to
the
middle
of
april
they
come
twittering
along
in
the
way
so
familiar
to
every
new
england
boy
the
barn
swallow
is
heard
first

in
a
day
or
two
by
the
squeaking
of
the
cliff
swallow
the
chimney
swallows
or
swifts
are
not
far
behind
and
remain
here
in
large
numbers
the
whole
season
the
purple
martins
appear
in
april
as
they
pass
north
and
again
in
july
and
august
on
their
return
accompanied
by
their
young
the
national
capital
is
situated
in
such
a
vast
spread
of
wild
wooded
or
country
and
is
in
itself
so
open
and
spacious
with
its
parks
and
large
government
reservations
that
an
unusual
number
of
birds
find
their
way
into
it
in
the
course
of
the
season
rare
warblers
as
the
the
and
the
pausing
in
may
on
their
northward
journey
pursue
their
insect
game
in
the
very
heart
of
the
town
i
have
heard
the
veery
thrush
in
the
trees
near
the
white
house
and
one
rainy
april
morning
about
six
he
came
and
blew
his
soft
mellow
flute
in
a
in
my
garden
the
tones
had
all
the
sweetness
and
wildness
they
have
when
heard
in
june
in
our
deep
northern
forests
a
day
or
two
afterward
in
the
same
tree
i
heard
for
the
first
time
the
song
of
the
wren
or
kinglet
the
same
liquid
bubble
and
cadence
which
characterize
the
generally
but
much
finer
and
more
delicate
than
the
song
of
any
other
variety
known
to
me
beginning
in
a
fine
round
note
and
rising
into
a
full
sustained
warble
symbol
deleted
a
strain
on
whole
remarkably
exquisite
and
pleasing
the
singer
being
all
the
while
as
busy
as
a
bee
catching
some
kind
of
insects
it
is
certainly
on
of
our
most
beautiful
and
audubon
enthusiasm
concerning
its
song
as
he
heard
it
in
the
wilds
of
labrador
is
not
a
bit
extravagant
the
song
of
the
kinglet
is
the
only
characteristic
that
allies
it
to
the
wrens
the
capitol
grounds
with
their
fine
large
trees
of
many
varieties
draw
many
kinds
of
birds
in
the
rear
of
the
building
the
extensive
grounds
are
peculiarly
attractive
being
a
gentle
slope
warm
and
protected
and
quite
thickly
wooded
here
in
early
spring
i
go
to
hear
the
robins
catbirds
blackbirds
wrens
etc
in
march
the
and
sparrows
may
be
seen
hopping
about
on
the
or
peering
slyly
from
the
evergreens
the
robin
hops
about
freely
upon
the
grass
notwithstanding
the
keepers
warning
and
at
intervals
and
especially
at
sunset
carols
from
the
treetops
his
loud
hearty
strain
the
kingbird
and
orchard
starling
remain
the
whole
season
and
breed
in
the
treetops
the
rich
copious
song
of
the
starling
may
be
heard
there
all
the
forenoon
the
song
of
some
birds
is
like
scarlet
strong
intense
emphatic
this
is
the
character
of
the
orchard
starlings
also
the
tanagers
and
the
various
grosbeaks
on
the
other
hand
the
songs
of
other
birds
as
of
certain
of
the
thrushes
suggest
the
serene
blue
of
the
upper
sky
in
february
one
may
hear
in
the
smithsonian
grounds
the
song
of
the
fox
sparrow
it
is
a
strong
richly
modulated
whistle
the
finest
sparrow
note
i
have
ever
heard
a
curious
and
charming
sound
may
be
heard
here
in
may
you
are
walking
forth
in
the
soft
morning
air
when
suddenly
there
comes
a
burst
of
bobolink
melody
form
some
mysterious
source
a
score
of
throats
pour
out
one
brief
hilarious
tuneful
jubilee
and
are
suddenly
silent
there
is
a
strange
remoteness
and
fascination
about
it
presently
you
will
discover
its
source
skyward
and
a
quick
eye
will
detect
the
gay
band
pushing
northward
they
seem
to
scent
the
fragrant
meadows
afar
off
and
shout
forth
snatches
of
their
songs
in
anticipation
the
bobolink
does
not
breed
in
the
district
but
usually
pauses
in
his
journey
and
feeds
during
the
day
in
the
north
of
the
city
when
the
season
is
backward
they
tarry
a
week
or
ten
days
singing
freely
and
appearing
quite
at
home
in
large
flocks
they
search
over
every
inch
of
ground
and
at
intervals
hover
on
the
wing
or
alight
in
the
treetops
all
pouring
forth
their
gladness
at
once
and
filling
the
air
with
a
multitudinous
musical
clamor
they
continue
to
pass
traveling
by
night
and
feeding
by
day
till
after
the
middle
of
may
when
they
cease
in
september
with
numbers
greatly
increased
they
are
on
their
way
back
i
am
first
advised
of
their
return
by
hearing
their
calls
at
night
as
they
fly
over
the
city
on
certain
nights
the
sound
becomes
quite
noticeable
i
have
awakened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
through
the
open
window
as
i
lay
in
bed
heard
their
faint
notes
the
warblers
begin
to
return
about
the
same
time
and
are
clearly
distinguished
by
their
timid
yeaps
on
dark
cloudy
nights
the
birds
seem
confused
by
the
lights
of
the
city
and
apparently
wander
about
above
it
in
the
spring
the
same
curious
incident
is
repeated
though
but
few
voices
can
be
identified
i
make
out
the
snowbird
the
bobolink
the
warblers
and
on
two
nights
during
the
early
part
of
may
i
heard
very
clearly
the
call
of
the
sandpipers
instead
of
the
bobolink
one
encounters
here
in
the
june
meadows
the
bunting
a
bird
very
closely
related
to
the
sparrows
and
a
very
persistent
if
not
a
very
musical
songster
he
perches
upon
the
fences
and
upon
the
trees
by
the
roadside
and
spreading
his
tail
gives
forth
his
harsh
strain
which
may
be
roughly
worded
thus
fscp
fscp
fee
fee
fee
like
all
sounds
associated
with
early
summer
it
soon
has
a
charm
to
the
ear
quite
independent
of
its
intrinsic
merits
outside
of
the
city
limits
the
great
point
of
interest
to
the
rambler
and
lover
of
nature
is
the
rock
creek
region
rock
creek
is
a
large
rough
rapid
stream
which
has
its
source
in
the
interior
of
maryland
and
flows
in
to
the
potomac
between
washington
and
georgetown
its
course
for
five
or
six
miles
out
of
washington
is
marked
by
great
diversity
of
scenery
flowing
in
a
deep
valley
which
now
and
then
becomes
a
wild
gorge
with
overhanging
rocks
and
high
precipitous
headlands
for
the
most
part
wooded
here
reposing
in
long
dark
reaches
there
sweeping
and
hurrying
around
a
sudden
bend
or
over
a
rocky
bed
receiving
at
short
intervals
small
runs
and
spring
rivulets
which
open
up
vistas
and
outlooks
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
most
charming
description
rock
creek
has
an
abundance
of
all
the
elements
that
make
up
not
only
pleasing
but
wild
and
rugged
scenery
there
is
perhaps
not
another
city
in
the
union
that
has
on
its
very
threshold
so
much
natural
beauty
and
grandeur
such
as
men
seek
for
in
remote
forests
and
mountains
a
few
touches
of
art
would
convert
this
whole
region
extending
from
georgetown
to
what
is
known
as
crystal
springs
not
more
than
two
miles
from
the
present
state
department
into
a
park
unequaled
by
anything
in
the
world
there
are
passages
between
these
two
points
as
wild
and
savage
and
apparently
as
remote
from
civilization
as
anything
one
meets
with
in
the
mountain
sources
of
the
hudson
or
the
delaware
one
of
the
tributaries
to
rock
creek
within
this
limit
is
called
piny
branch
it
is
a
small
noisy
brook
flowing
through
a
valley
of
great
natural
beauty
and
picturesqueness
shaded
nearly
all
the
way
by
woods
of
oak
chestnut
and
beech
and
abounding
in
dark
recesses
and
hidden
retreats
i
must
not
forget
to
mention
the
many
springs
with
which
this
whole
region
is
supplied
each
the
centre
of
some
wild
nook
perhaps
the
head
of
a
little
valley
one
or
two
hundred
yards
long
through
which
one
catches
a
glimpse
or
hears
the
voice
of
the
main
creek
rushing
along
below
my
walks
tend
in
this
direction
more
frequently
than
in
any
other
here
the
boys
go
too
troops
of
them
of
a
sunday
to
bathe
and
prowl
around
and
indulge
the
instincts
that
still
lurk
within
them
life
in
all
its
forms
is
most
abundant
near
water
the
rank
vegetation
nurtures
the
insects
and
the
insects
draw
the
birds
the
first
week
in
march
on
some
southern
slope
where
the
sunshine
lies
warm
and
long
i
usually
find
the
hepatica
in
bloom
though
with
scarcely
an
inch
of
stalk
in
the
spring
runs
the
skunk
cabbage
pushes
its
pike
up
through
the
mould
the
flower
appearing
first
as
if
nature
had
made
a
mistake
it
is
not
till
about
the
of
april
that
many
wild
flowers
may
be
looked
for
by
this
time
the
hepatica
anemone
saxifrage
arbutus
houstonia
and
bloodroot
may
be
counted
on
a
week
later
the
claytonia
or
spring
beauty
violets
a
low
buttercup
vetch
corydalis
and
potentilla
appear
these
comprise
most
of
the
april
flowers
and
may
be
found
in
great
profusion
in
the
rock
creek
and
piny
branch
region
in
each
little
valley
or
spring
run
some
one
species
predominates
i
know
invariably
where
to
look
for
the
first
liverwort
and
where
the
largest
and
finest
may
be
found
on
a
dry
gravelly
the
violet
grows
in
great
abundance
and
is
sparse
in
neighboring
districts
this
flower
which
i
never
saw
in
the
north
is
the
most
beautiful
and
showy
of
all
the
violets
and
calls
forth
rapturous
applause
from
all
persons
who
visit
the
woods
it
grows
in
little
groups
and
clusters
and
bears
a
close
resemblance
to
the
pansies
of
the
gardens
its
two
purple
velvety
petals
seem
to
fall
over
tiny
shoulders
like
a
rich
cape
on
the
same
slope
and
on
no
other
i
go
about
the
of
may
for
lupine
or
which
makes
the
ground
look
blue
from
a
little
distance
on
the
other
or
northern
side
of
the
slope
the
arbutus
during
the
first
half
of
april
perfumes
the
wildwood
air
a
few
paces
farther
on
in
the
bottom
of
a
little
spring
run
the
mandrake
shades
the
ground
with
its
miniature
umbrellas
it
begins
to
push
its
green
up
through
the
ground
by
the
of
april
but
is
not
in
bloom
till
the
of
may
it
has
a
single
white
flower
with
a
sweet
sickish
odor
growing
immediately
beneath
its
broad
leafy
top
by
the
same
run
grow
watercresses
and
two
kinds
of
anemones
the
pennsylvania
and
the
grove
anemone
the
bloodroot
is
very
common
at
the
foot
of
almost
every
warm
slope
in
the
rock
creek
woods
and
where
the
wind
has
tucked
it
up
well
with
the
coverlid
of
dry
leaves
makes
its
appearance
almost
as
soon
as
the
liverwort
it
is
singular
how
little
warmth
is
necessary
to
encourage
these
earlier
flowers
to
put
forth
it
would
seem
as
if
some
influence
must
come
on
in
advance
underground
and
get
things
ready
so
that
when
the
outside
temperature
is
propitious
they
at
once
venture
out
i
have
found
the
bloodroot
when
it
was
still
freezing
two
or
three
nights
in
the
week
and
have
known
at
least
three
varieties
of
early
flowers
to
be
buried
in
eight
inches
of
snow
another
abundant
flower
in
the
rock
creek
region
is
the
spring
beauty
like
most
others
it
grows
in
streaks
a
few
paces
from
where
your
attention
is
monopolized
by
violets
or
arbutus
it
is
arrested
by
the
claytonia
growing
in
such
profusion
that
it
is
impossible
to
set
the
foot
down
without
crushing
the
flowers
only
the
forenoon
walker
sees
them
in
all
their
beauty
as
later
in
the
day
their
eyes
are
closed
and
their
pretty
heads
drooped
in
slumber
in
only
one
locality
do
i
find
the
a
yellow
variety
the
flowers
that
overleap
all
bounds
in
this
section
are
the
houstonias
by
the
of
april
they
are
very
noticeable
in
warm
damp
places
along
the
borders
of
the
woods
and
in
fields
but
by
may
these
localities
are
clouded
with
them
they
become
visible
from
the
highway
across
wide
fields
and
look
like
little
puffs
of
smoke
clinging
close
to
the
ground
on
the
of
may
i
go
to
the
rock
creek
or
piny
branch
region
to
hear
the
wood
thrush
i
always
find
him
by
this
date
leisurely
chanting
his
lofty
strain
other
thrushes
are
seen
now
also
or
even
earlier
as
wilson
the
the
hermit
the
two
latter
silent
but
the
former
musical
occasionally
in
the
earlier
part
of
may
i
find
the
woods
literally
swarming
with
warblers
exploring
every
branch
and
leaf
from
the
tallest
tulip
to
the
lowest
so
urgent
is
the
demand
for
food
during
their
long
northern
journeys
at
night
they
are
up
and
away
some
varieties
as
the
blue
the
and
the
blackburnian
during
their
brief
stay
sing
nearly
as
freely
as
in
their
for
two
or
three
years
i
have
chanced
to
meet
little
companies
of
the
warbler
searching
for
food
in
an
oak
wood
on
an
elevated
piece
of
ground
they
kept
well
up
among
the
branches
were
rather
slow
in
their
movements
and
evidently
disposed
to
tarry
but
a
short
time
the
summer
residents
here
belonging
to
this
class
of
birds
are
few
i
have
observed
the
black
and
white
creeping
warbler
the
kentucky
warbler
the
warbler
the
redstart
and
the
breeding
near
rock
creek
of
these
the
kentucky
warbler
is
by
far
the
most
interesting
though
quite
rare
i
meet
with
him
in
low
damp
places
in
the
woods
usually
on
the
steep
sides
of
some
little
run
i
hear
at
intervals
a
clear
strong
whistle
or
warble
and
presently
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
bird
as
he
jumps
up
from
the
ground
to
take
an
insect
or
worm
from
the
under
side
of
a
leaf
this
is
his
characteristic
movement
he
belongs
to
the
class
of
ground
warblers
and
his
range
is
very
low
indeed
lower
than
that
of
any
other
species
with
which
i
am
acquainted
he
is
on
the
ground
nearly
all
the
time
moving
rapidly
along
taking
spiders
and
bugs
overturning
leaves
peeping
under
sticks
and
into
crevices
and
every
now
and
then
leaping
up
eight
or
ten
inches
to
take
his
game
from
beneath
some
overhanging
leaf
or
branch
thus
each
species
has
its
range
more
or
less
marked
draw
a
line
three
feet
from
the
ground
and
you
mark
the
usual
limit
of
the
kentucky
warbler
quest
for
food
six
or
eight
feet
higher
bounds
the
usual
range
of
such
birds
as
the
warbler
the
mourning
ground
warbler
the
maryland
the
lower
branches
of
the
higher
growths
and
the
higher
branches
of
the
lower
growths
are
plainly
preferred
by
the
warbler
in
those
localities
where
he
is
found
the
thrushes
feed
mostly
on
and
near
the
ground
while
some
of
the
vireos
and
the
true
flycatchers
explore
the
highest
branches
but
the
warblers
as
a
rule
are
all
partial
to
thick
rank
undergrowths
the
kentucky
warbler
is
a
large
bird
for
the
genus
and
quite
notable
in
appearance
his
back
is
clear
his
throat
and
breast
bright
yellow
a
still
more
prominent
feature
is
a
black
streak
on
the
side
of
the
face
extending
down
the
neck
another
familiar
bird
here
which
i
never
met
with
in
the
north
is
the
gnatcatcher
called
by
audubon
the
flycatching
warbler
in
form
and
manner
it
seems
almost
a
duplicate
of
the
catbird
on
a
small
scale
it
mews
like
a
young
kitten
erects
its
tail
flirts
droops
its
wings
goes
through
a
variety
of
motions
when
disturbed
by
your
presence
and
in
many
ways
recalls
its
dusky
prototype
its
color
above
is
a
light
gradually
fading
till
it
becomes
white
on
the
breast
and
belly
it
is
a
very
small
bird
and
has
a
long
facile
slender
tail
its
song
is
a
lisping
chattering
incoherent
warble
now
faintly
reminding
one
of
the
goldfinch
now
of
a
miniature
catbird
then
of
a
tiny
having
much
variety
but
no
unity
and
little
cadence
another
bird
which
has
interested
me
here
is
the
louisiana
water
thrush
called
also
and
it
is
one
of
a
trio
of
birds
which
has
confused
the
ornithologists
much
the
other
two
species
are
the
thrush
or
and
the
northern
or
small
the
present
species
though
not
abundant
is
frequently
met
with
along
rock
creek
it
is
a
very
quick
vivacious
bird
and
belongs
to
the
class
of
ecstatic
singers
i
have
seen
a
pair
of
these
thrushes
on
a
bright
may
day
flying
to
and
fro
between
two
spring
runs
alighting
at
intermediate
points
the
male
breaking
out
into
one
of
the
most
exuberant
unpremeditated
strains
i
ever
heard
its
song
is
a
sudden
burst
beginning
with
three
or
four
clear
round
notes
much
resembling
certain
tones
of
the
clarinet
and
terminating
in
a
rapid
intricate
warble
this
bird
resembles
a
thrush
only
in
its
color
which
is
above
and
grayish
white
beneath
with
speckled
throat
and
breast
its
habits
manners
and
voice
suggest
those
of
a
lark
i
seldom
go
the
rock
creek
route
without
being
amused
and
sometimes
annoyed
by
the
chat
this
bird
also
has
something
of
the
manners
and
build
of
the
catbird
yet
he
is
truly
an
original
the
catbird
is
mild
and
feminine
compared
with
this
rollicking
polyglot
his
voice
is
very
loud
and
strong
and
quite
uncanny
no
sooner
have
you
penetrated
his
retreat
which
is
usually
a
thick
undergrowth
in
low
wet
localities
near
the
woods
or
in
old
fields
than
he
begins
his
serenade
which
for
the
variety
grotesqueness
and
uncouthness
of
the
notes
is
not
unlike
a
country
skimmerton
if
one
passes
directly
along
the
bird
may
scarcely
break
the
silence
but
pause
a
while
or
loiter
quietly
about
and
your
presence
stimulates
him
to
do
his
best
he
peeps
quizzically
at
you
from
beneath
the
branches
and
gives
a
sharp
feline
mew
in
a
moment
more
he
says
very
distinctly
who
who
then
in
rapid
succession
follow
notes
the
most
discordant
that
ever
broke
the
sylvan
silence
now
he
barks
like
a
puppy
then
quacks
like
a
duck
then
rattles
like
a
kingfisher
then
squalls
like
a
fox
then
caws
like
a
crow
then
mews
like
a
cat
now
he
calls
as
if
to
be
heard
a
long
way
off
then
changes
his
key
as
if
addressing
the
spectator
though
very
shy
and
carefully
keeping
himself
screened
when
you
show
any
disposition
to
get
a
better
view
he
will
presently
if
you
remain
quiet
ascend
a
twig
or
hop
out
on
a
branch
in
plain
sight
lop
his
tail
droop
his
wings
cock
his
head
and
become
very
melodramatic
in
less
than
half
a
minute
he
darts
into
the
bushes
again
and
again
tunes
up
no
frenchman
rolling
his
r
so
fluently
wrrr
that
it
chee
quack
cluck
now
hit
it
when
caw
caw
cut
cut
who
who
mew
mew
and
so
on
till
you
are
tired
of
listening
observing
one
very
closely
one
day
i
discovered
that
he
was
limited
to
six
notes
or
changes
which
he
went
through
in
regular
order
scarcely
varying
a
note
in
a
dozen
repetitions
sometimes
when
a
considerable
distance
off
he
will
fly
down
to
have
a
nearer
view
of
you
and
such
curious
expressive
flight
legs
extended
head
lowered
wings
rapidly
vibrating
the
whole
action
piquant
and
droll
the
chat
is
an
elegant
bird
both
in
form
and
color
its
plumage
is
remarkably
firm
and
compact
color
above
light
beneath
bright
yellow
beak
black
and
strong
the
cardinal
grosbeak
or
virginia
redbird
is
quite
common
in
the
same
localities
though
more
inclined
to
seek
the
woods
it
is
much
sought
after
by
bird
fanciers
and
by
boy
gunners
and
consequently
is
very
shy
this
bird
suggests
a
british
redcoat
his
heavy
pointed
beak
his
high
cockade
the
black
stripe
down
his
face
the
expression
of
weight
and
massiveness
about
his
head
and
neck
and
his
erect
attitude
give
him
a
decided
appearance
and
there
is
something
of
the
tone
of
the
fife
in
his
song
or
whistle
while
his
ordinary
note
when
disturbed
is
like
the
clink
of
a
sabre
yesterday
as
i
sat
indolently
swinging
in
the
loop
of
a
grapevine
beneath
a
thick
canopy
of
green
branches
in
a
secluded
nook
by
a
spring
run
one
of
these
birds
came
pursuing
some
kind
of
insect
but
a
few
feet
above
me
he
hopped
about
now
and
then
uttering
his
sharp
note
till
some
moth
or
beetle
trying
to
escape
he
broke
down
through
the
cover
almost
where
i
sat
the
effect
was
like
a
firebrand
coming
down
through
the
branches
instantly
catching
sight
of
me
he
darted
away
much
alarmed
the
female
is
tinged
with
brown
and
shows
but
a
little
red
except
when
she
takes
flight
by
far
the
most
abundant
species
of
woodpecker
about
washington
is
the
it
is
more
common
than
the
robin
not
in
the
deep
woods
but
among
the
scattered
dilapidated
oaks
and
groves
on
the
hills
and
in
the
fields
i
hear
almost
every
day
his
uncanny
note
like
that
of
some
larger
proceeding
from
an
oak
grove
just
beyond
the
boundary
he
is
a
fellow
and
very
tough
yet
how
beautiful
as
he
flits
about
the
open
woods
connecting
the
trees
by
a
gentle
arc
of
crimson
and
white
this
is
another
bird
with
a
military
look
his
deliberate
dignified
ways
and
his
bright
uniform
of
red
white
and
bespeak
him
an
officer
of
rank
another
favorite
beat
of
mine
is
northeast
of
the
city
looking
from
the
capitol
in
this
direction
scarcely
more
than
a
mile
distant
you
see
a
broad
green
falling
very
gently
and
spreading
into
a
large
expanse
of
the
summit
if
so
gentle
a
swell
of
greensward
may
be
said
to
have
a
summit
is
covered
with
a
grove
of
large
oaks
and
sweeping
black
out
of
sight
like
a
mantle
the
front
line
of
a
thick
forest
bounds
the
sides
this
emerald
landscape
is
seen
from
a
number
of
points
in
the
city
looking
along
new
york
avenue
from
northern
liberty
market
the
eye
glances
as
it
were
from
the
red
clay
of
the
street
and
alights
upon
this
fresh
scene
in
the
distance
it
is
a
standing
invitation
to
the
citizen
to
come
forth
and
be
refreshed
as
i
turn
from
some
hot
hard
street
how
inviting
it
looks
i
bathe
my
eyes
in
it
as
in
a
fountain
sometimes
troops
of
cattle
are
seen
grazing
upon
it
in
june
the
gathering
of
the
hay
may
be
witnessed
when
the
ground
is
covered
with
snow
numerous
stacks
or
clusters
of
stacks
are
still
left
for
the
eye
to
contemplate
the
woods
which
clothe
the
east
side
of
this
hill
and
sweep
away
to
the
east
are
among
the
most
charming
to
be
found
in
the
district
the
main
growth
is
oak
and
chestnut
with
a
thin
sprinkling
of
laurel
azalea
and
dogwood
it
is
the
only
locality
in
which
i
have
found
the
dogtooth
violet
in
bloom
and
the
best
place
i
know
of
to
gather
arbutus
on
one
slope
the
ground
is
covered
with
moss
through
which
the
arbutus
trails
its
glories
emerging
from
these
woods
toward
the
city
one
sees
the
white
dome
of
the
capitol
soaring
over
the
green
swell
of
earth
immediately
in
front
and
lifting
its
four
thousand
tons
of
iron
gracefully
and
lightly
into
the
air
of
all
the
sights
in
washington
that
which
will
survive
the
longest
in
my
memory
is
the
vision
of
the
great
dome
thus
rising
above
the
hills
vi
birch
browsings
the
region
of
which
i
am
about
to
speak
lies
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
comprises
parts
of
three
counties
ulster
sullivan
and
delaware
it
is
drained
by
tributaries
of
both
the
hudson
and
delaware
and
next
to
the
adirondack
section
contains
more
wild
land
than
any
other
tract
in
the
state
the
mountains
which
traverse
it
and
impart
to
it
its
severe
northern
climate
belong
properly
to
the
catskill
range
on
some
maps
of
the
state
they
are
called
the
pine
mountains
though
with
obvious
local
impropriety
as
pine
so
far
as
i
have
observed
is
nowhere
found
upon
them
birch
mountains
would
be
a
more
characteristic
name
as
on
their
summits
birch
is
the
prevailing
tree
they
are
the
natural
home
of
the
black
and
yellow
birch
which
grow
here
to
unusual
size
on
their
sides
beech
and
maple
abound
while
mantling
their
lower
slopes
and
darkening
the
valleys
hemlock
formerly
enticed
the
lumberman
and
tanner
except
in
remote
or
inaccessible
localities
the
latter
tree
is
now
almost
never
found
in
shandaken
and
along

is
likely
to
yield

the
score

arisen
and
flourished
upon
the
bark
and
some
of
them
still
remain
passing
through
that
region
the
present
season
i
saw
that
the
few
patches
of
hemlock
that
still
lingered
high
up
on
the
sides
of
the
mountains
were
being
felled
and
peeled
the
fresh
white
boles
or
the
trees
just
stripped
of
their
bark
being
visible
a
long
distance
among
these
mountains
there
are
no
sharp
peaks
or
abrupt
declivities
as
in
a
volcanic
region
but
long
uniform
ranges
heavily
timbered
to
their
summits
and
delighting
the
eye
with
vast
undulating
horizon
lines
looking
south
from
the
heights
about
the
head
of
the
delaware
one
sees
twenty
miles
away
a
continual
succession
of
blue
ranges
one
behind
the
other
if
a
few
large
trees
are
missing
on
the
sky
line
one
can
see
the
break
a
long
distance
off
approaching
this
region
from
the
hudson
river
side
you
cross
a
rough
rolling
stretch
of
country
skirting
the
base
of
the
catskills
which
from
a
point
near
saugerties
sweep
inland
after
a
drive
of
a
few
hours
you
are
within
the
shadow
of
a
high
bold
mountain
which
forms
a
sort
of
to
this
part
of
the
range
and
which
is
simple
called
high
point
to
the
east
and
southeast
it
slopes
down
rapidly
to
the
plain
and
looks
defiance
toward
the
hudson
twenty
miles
distant
in
the
rear
of
it
and
radiating
from
it
west
and
northwest
are
numerous
smaller
ranges
backing
up
as
it
were
this
haughty
chief
from
this
point
through
to
pennsylvania
a
distance
of
nearly
one
hundred
miles
stretches
the
tract
of
which
i
speak
it
is
a
belt
of
country
from
twenty
to
thirty
miles
wide
bleak
and
wild
and
but
sparsely
settled
the
traveler
on
the
new

and
erie
railroad
gets
a
glimpse
of
it
many
cold
rapid
trout
streams
which
flow
to
all
points
of
the
compass
have
their
source
in
the
small
lakes
and
copious
mountain
springs
of
this
region
the
names
of
some
of
them
are
mill

neversink
big

and

beaver
kill
is
the
main
outlet
on
the
west
it
joins
the
deleware
in
the
wilds
of
hancock
the
neversink
lays
open
the
region
to
the
south
and
also
joins
the
delaware
to
the
east
various
kills
unite
with
the
big

to
form
the
esopus
which
flows
into
the
hudson
dry
brook
and
mill
brook
both
famous
trout
streams
from
twelve

find
their
way
into

the

or
pepacton
branch
of
the
delaware
itself
takes
its
rise
near
here
in
a
deep
pass
between
the
mountains
i
have
many
times
drunk
at
a
copious
spring
by
the
roadside
where
the
infant
river
first
sees
the
light
a
few
yards
beyond
the
water
flows
the
other
way
directing
its
course
through
the
bear
kill
and
schoharie
kill
into
the
mohawk
such
game
and
wild
animals
as
still
linger
in
the
state
are
found
in
this
region
bears
occasionally
make
havoc
among
the
sheep
the
clearings
at
the
head
of
a
valley
are
oftenest
the
scene
of
their
depredations
wild
pigeons
in
immense
numbers
used
to
breed
regularly
in
the
valley
of
the
big
ingin
and
about
the
head
of
the
neversink
the
treetops
for
miles
were
full
of
their
nests
while
the
going
and
coming
of
the
old
birds
kept
up
a
constant
din
but
the
gunners
soon
got
wind
of
it
and
from
far
and
near
were
wont
to
pour
in
during
the
spring
and
to
slaughter
both
old
and
young
this
practice
soon
had
the
effect
of
driving
the
pigeons
all
away
and
now
only
a
few
pairs
breed
in
these
woods
deer
are
still
met
with
though
they
are
becoming
scarcer
every
year
last
winter
near
seventy
head
were
killed
on
the
beaver
kill
alone
i
heard
of
one
wretch
who
finding
the
deer
snowbound
walked
up
to
them
on
his
snowshoes
and
one
morning
before
breakfast
slaughtered
six
leaving
their
carcasses
where
they
fell
there
are
traditions
of
persons
having
been
smitten
blind
or
senseless
when
about
to
commit
some
heinous
offense
but
the
fact
that
this
villain
escaped
without
some
such
visitation
throws
discredit
on
all
such
stories
the
great
attraction
however
of
this
region
is
the
brook
trout
with
which
the
streams
and
lakes
abound
the
water
is
of
excessive
coldness
the
thermometer
indicating
and
the
springs
and
or
in
the
smaller
streams
the
trout
are
generally
small
but
in
the
more
remote
branches
their
number
is
very
great
in
such
localities
the
fish
are
quite
black
but
in
the
lakes
they
are
of
a
lustre
and
brilliancy
impossible
to
describe
these
waters
have
been
much
visited
of
late
years
by
fishing
parties
and
the
name
of
the
beaver
kill
is
now
a
potent
name
among
new
york
sportsmen
one
lake
in
the
wilds
of
callikoon
abounds
in
a
peculiar
species
of
white
sucker
which
is
of
excellent
quality
it
is
taken
only
in
spring
during
the
spawning
season
at
the
time
when
the
leaves
are
as
big
as
a
chipmunk
ears
the
fish
run
up
the
small
streams
and
inlets
beginning
at
nightfall
and
continuing
till
the
channel
is
literally
packed
with
them
and
every
inch
of
space
is
occupied
the
fishermen
pounce
upon
them
at
such
times
and
scoop
them
up
by
the
bushel
usually
wading
right
into
the
living
mass
and
landing
the
fish
with
their
hands
a
small
party
will
often
secure
in
this
manner
a
of
fish
certain
conditions
of
the
weather
as
a
warm
south
or
southwest
wind
are
considered
most
favorable
for
the
fish
to
run
though
familiar
all
my
life
with
the
outskirts
of
this
region
i
have
only
twice
dipped
into
its
wilder
portions
once
in
a
friend
and
myself
traced
the
beaver
kill
to
its
source
and
encamped
by
balsam
lake
a
cold
and
protracted
rainstorm
coming
on
we
were
obliged
to
leave
the
woods
before
we
were
ready
neither
of
us
will
soon
forget
that
tramp
by
an
unknown
route
over
the
mountains
encumbered
as
we
were
with
a
hundred
and
one
superfluities
which
we
had
foolishly
brought
along
to
solace
ourselves
with
in
the
woods
nor
that
halt
on
the
summit
where
we
cooked
and
ate
our
fish
in
the
drizzling
rain
nor
again
that
rude
log
house
with
its
sweet
hospitality
which
we
reached
just
at
nightfall
on
mill
brook
in
a
party
of
three
of
us
set
out
for
a
brief
trouting
excursion
to
a
body
of
water
called
thomas
lake
situated
in
the
same
chain
of
mountains
on
this
excursion
more
particularly
than
on
any
other
i
have
ever
undertaken
i
was
taught
how
poor
an
indian
i
should
make
and
what
a
ridiculous
figure
a
party
of
men
may
cut
in
the
woods
when
the
way
is
uncertain
and
the
mountains
high
we
left
our
team
at
a
farmhouse
near
the
head
of
the
mill
brook
one
june
afternoon
and
with
knapsacks
on
our
shoulders
struck
into
the
woods
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
hoping
to
cross
the
range
that
intervened
between
us
and
the
lake
by
sunset
we
engaged
a
but
rather
indolent
young
man
who
happened
to
be
stopping
at
the
house
and
who
had
carried
a
knapsack
in
the
union
armies
to
pilot
us
a
couple
of
miles
into
the
woods
so
as
to
guard
against
any
mistakes
at
the
outset
it
seemed
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
find
the
lake
the
lay
of
the
land
was
so
simple
according
to
accounts
that
i
felt
sure
i
could
go
it
in
the
dark
go
up
this
little
brook
to
its
source
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
they
said
the
valley
that
contains
the
lake
heads
directly
on
the
other
side
what
could
be
easier
but
on
a
little
further
inquiry
they
said
we
should
bear
well
to
the
left
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
mountain
this
opened
the
doors
again
bearing
well
to
the
left
was
an
uncertain
performance
in
strange
woods
we
might
bear
so
well
to
the
left
that
it
would
bring
us
ill
but
why
bear
to
the
left
at
all
if
the
lake
was
directly
opposite
well
not
quite
opposite
a
little
to
the
left
there
were
two
or
three
other
valleys
that
headed
in
near
there
we
could
easily
find
the
right
one
but
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
we
engaged
a
guide
as
stated
to
give
us
a
good
start
and
go
with
us
beyond
the
point
he
had
been
to
the
lake
the
winter
before
and
knew
the
way
our
course
the
first
half
hour
was
along
an
obscure
which
had
been
used
for
drawing
ash
logs
off
mountain
in
winter
there
was
some
hemlock
but
more
maple
and
birch
the
woods
were
dense
and
free
from
underbrush
the
ascent
gradual
most
of
the
way
we
kept
the
voice
of
the
creek
in
our
ear
on
the
right
i
approached
it
once
and
found
it
swarming
with
trout
the
water
was
as
cold
as
one
ever
need
wish
after
a
while
the
ascent
grew
steeper
the
creek
became
a
mere
rill
that
issued
from
beneath
loose
rocks
and
stones
and
with
much
labor
and
puffing
we
drew
ourselves
up
the
rugged
declivity
every
mountain
has
its
steepest
point
which
is
usually
near
the
summit
in
keeping
i
suppose
with
the
providence
that
makes
the
darkest
hour
just
before
day
it
is
steep
steeper
steepest
till
you
emerge
on
the
smooth
level
or
gently
rounded
space
at
the
top
which
the
old
polished
off
so
long
ago
we
found
this
mountain
had
a
hollow
in
its
back
where
the
ground
was
soft
and
swampy
some
gigantic
ferns
which
we
passed
through
came
nearly
to
our
shoulders
we
passed
also
several
patches
of
swamp
honeysuckles
red
with
blossoms
our
guide
at
length
paused
on
a
big
rock
where
the
land
begin
to
dip
down
the
other
way
and
concluded
that
he
had
gone
far
enough
and
that
we
would
now
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
lake
it
must
lie
right
down
there
he
said
pointing
with
his
hand
but
it
was
plain
that
he
was
not
quite
sure
in
his
own
mind
he
had
several
times
wavered
in
his
course
and
had
shown
considerable
embarrassment
when
bearing
to
the
left
across
the
summit
still
we
thought
little
of
it
we
were
full
of
confidence
and
bidding
him
adieu
plunged
down
the
following
a
spring
run
that
we
had
no
doubt
left
to
the
lake
in
these
woods
which
had
a
southeastern
exposure
i
first
began
to
notice
the
wood
thrush
in
coming
up
the
other
side
i
had
not
seen
a
feather
of
any
kind
or
heard
a
note
now
the
golden
of
the
wood
thrush
sounded
through
the
silent
woods
while
looking
for
a
about
halfway
down
the
mountain
i
saw
a
thrush
nest
in
a
little
sapling
about
ten
feet
from
the
ground
after
continuing
our
descent
till
our
only
guide
the
spring
run
became
quite
a
trout
brook
and
its
tiny
murmur
a
loud
brawl
we
began
to
peer
anxiously
through
the
trees
for
a
glimpse
of
the
lake
or
for
some
conformation
of
the
land
that
would
indicate
its
proximity
an
object
which
we
vaguely
discerned
in
looking
under
the
near
trees
and
over
the
more
distant
ones
proved
on
further
inspection
to
be
a
patch
of
plowed
ground
presently
we
made
out
a
burnt
fallow
near
it
this
was
a
wet
blanket
to
our
enthusiasm
no
lake
no
sport
no
trout
for
supper
that
night
the
rather
indolent
young
man
had
either
played
us
a
trick
or
as
seemed
more
likely
had
missed
the
way
we
were
particularly
anxious
to
be
at
the
lake
between
sundown
and
dark
as
at
that
time
the
trout
jump
most
freely
pushing
on
we
soon
emerged
into
a
stumpy
field
at
the
head
of
a
steep
valley
which
swept
around
toward
the
west
about
two
hundred
rods
below
us
was
a
rude
log
house
with
smoke
issuing
from
the
chimney
a
boy
came
out
and
moved
toward
the
spring
with
a
pail
in
his
hand
we
shouted
to
him
when
he
turned
and
ran
back
into
the
house
without
pausing
to
reply
in
a
moment
the
whole
family
hastily
rushed
into
the
yard
and
turned
their
faces
toward
us
if
we
had
come
down
their
chimney
they
could
not
have
seemed
more
astonished
not
making
out
what
they
said
i
went
down
to
the
house
and
learned
to
my
chagrin
that
we
were
still
on
the
mill
brook
side
having
crossed
only
a
spur
of
the
mountain
we
had
not
borne
sufficiently
to
the
left
so
that
the
main
range
which
at
the
point
of
crossing
suddenly
breaks
off
to
the
southeast
still
intervened
between
us
and
the
lake
we
were
about
five
miles
as
the
water
runs
from
the
point
of
starting
and
over
two
from
the
lake
we
must
go
directly
back
to
the
top
of
the
range
where
the
guide
had
left
us
and
then
by
keeping
well
to
the
left
we
would
soon
come
to
a
line
of
marked
trees
which
would
lead
us
to
the
lake
so
turning
upon
our
trail
we
doggedly
began
the
work
of
undoing
what
we
had
just
done
in
all
cases
a
disagreeable
task
in
this
case
a
very
laborious
one
also
it
was
after
sunset
when
we
turned
back
and
before
we
had
got
halfway
up
the
mountain
it
began
to
be
quite
dark
we
were
often
obliged
to
rest
our
packs
against
the
trees
and
take
breath
which
made
our
progress
slow
finally
a
halt
was
called
beside
an
immense
flat
rock
which
had
paused
on
its
slide
down
the
mountain
and
we
prepared
to
encamp
for
the
night
a
fire
was
built
the
rock
cleared
off
a
small
ration
of
bread
served
out
our
accoutrements
hung
up
out
of
the
way
of
the
hedgehogs
that
were
supposed
to
infest
the
locality
and
then
we
disposed
ourselves
for
sleep
if
the
owls
or
porcupines
and
i
think
i
heard
one
of
the
latter
in
the
middle
of
the
night
reconnoitred
our
camp
they
saw
a
buffalo
robe
spread
upon
a
rock
with
three
old
felt
hats
arranged
on
one
side
and
three
pairs
of
cowhide
boots
protruding
from
the
other
when
we
lay
down
there
was
apparently
not
a
mosquito
in
the
woods
but
the
as
thoreau
indian
aptly
named
the
midges
soon
found
us
out
and
after
the
fire
had
gone
down
annoyed
us
very
much
my
hands
and
wrists
suddenly
began
to
smart
and
itch
in
a
most
uncomfortable
manner
my
first
thought
was
that
they
had
been
poisoned
in
some
way
then
the
smarting
extended
to
my
neck
and
face
even
to
my
scalp
when
i
began
to
suspect
what
was
the
matter
so
wrapping
myself
up
more
thoroughly
and
stowing
my
hands
away
as
best
i
could
i
tried
to
sleep
being
some
time
behind
my
companions
who
appeared
not
to
mind
the
i
was
further
annoyed
by
some
little
irregularity
on
my
side
of
the
couch
the
chambermaid
had
not
beaten
it
up
well
one
huge
lump
refused
to
be
mollified
and
each
attempt
to
adapt
it
up
some
natural
hollow
in
my
own
body
brought
only
a
relief
but
at
last
i
got
the
better
of
this
also
and
slept
late
in
the
night
i
woke
up
just
in
time
to
hear
a
thrush
sing
in
a
tree
near
by
it
sang
as
loud
and
cheerily
as
at
midday
and
i
thought
myself
after
all
quite
in
luck
birds
occasionally
sing
at
night
just
as
the
cock
crows
i
have
heard
the
hairbird
and
the
note
of
the
kingbird
and
the
ruffed
grouse
frequently
drums
at
night
at
the
first
faint
signs
of
day
a
wood
thrush
sang
a
few
rods
below
us
then
after
a
little
delay
as
the
gray
light
began
to
grow
around
thrushes
broke
out
in
full
song
in
all
parts
of
the
woods
i
thought
i
had
never
before
heard
them
sing
so
sweetly
such
a
leisurely
golden
chant
it
consoled
us
for
all
we
had
undergone
it
was
the
first
thing
in
order
the
worms
were
safe
till
after
this
morning
chorus
i
judged
that
the
birds
roosted
but
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
in
fact
a
bird
in
all
cases
roosts
where
it
builds
and
the
wood
thrush
occupies
as
it
were
the
first
story
of
the
woods
there
is
something
singular
about
the
distribution
of
the
wood
thrushes
at
an
earlier
stage
of
my
observations
i
should
have
been
much
surprised
at
finding
them
in
these
woods
indeed
i
had
stated
in
print
on
two
occasions
that
the
wood
thrush
was
not
found
in
the
higher
lands
of
the
catskills
but
that
the
hermit
thrush
and
the
veery
or
wilson
thrush
were
common
it
turns
out
that
the
statement
is
only
half
true
the
wood
thrush
is
found
also
but
is
much
more
rare
and
secluded
in
its
habits
than
either
of
the
others
being
seen
only
during
the
breeding
season
on
remote
mountains
and
then
only
on
their
eastern
and
southern
slopes
i
have
never
yet
in
this
region
found
the
bird
spending
the
season
in
the
near
and
familiar
woods
which
is
directly
contrary
to
observations
i
have
made
in
other
parts
of
the
state
so
different
are
the
habits
of
birds
in
different
localities
as
soon
as
it
was
fairly
light
we
were
up
and
ready
to
resume
our
march
a
small
bit
of
bread
and
butter
and
a
swallow
or
two
of
whiskey
was
all
we
had
for
breakfast
that
morning
our
supply
of
each
was
very
limited
and
we
were
anxious
to
save
a
little
of
both
to
relieve
the
diet
of
trout
to
which
we
looked
forward
at
an
early
hour
we
reached
the
rock
where
we
had
parted
with
the
guide
and
looked
around
us
into
the
dense
trackless
woods
with
many
misgivings
to
strike
out
now
on
our
own
hook
where
the
way
was
so
blind
and
after
the
experience
we
had
just
had
was
a
step
not
to
be
carelessly
taken
the
tops
of
these
mountains
are
so
broad
and
a
short
distance
in
the
woods
seems
so
far
that
one
is
by
no
means
master
of
the
situation
after
reaching
the
summit
and
then
there
are
so
many
spurs
and
offshoots
and
changes
of
direction
added
to
the
impossibility
of
making
any
generalization
by
the
aid
of
the
eye
that
before
one
is
aware
of
it
he
is
very
wide
of
his
mark
i
remembered
now
that
a
young
farmer
of
my
acquaintance
had
told
me
how
he
had
made
a
long
day
march
through
the
heart
of
this
region
without
path
or
guide
of
any
kind
and
had
hit
his
mark
squarely
he
had
been
barkpeeling
in
callikoon
a
famous
country
for
barkpeeling
and
having
got
enough
of
it
he
desired
to
reach
his
home
on
dry
brook
without
making
the
usual
circuitous
journey
between
the
two
places
to
do
this
necessitated
a
march
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
across
several
ranges
of
mountains
and
through
an
unbroken
forest
a
hazardous
undertaking
in
which
no
one
would
join
him
even
the
old
hunters
who
were
familiar
with
the
ground
dissuaded
him
and
predicted
the
failure
of
his
enterprise
but
having
made
up
his
mind
he
possessed
himself
thoroughly
of
the
topography
of
the
country
from
the
aforesaid
hunters
shouldered
his
axe
and
set
out
holding
a
strait
course
through
the
woods
and
turning
aside
for
neither
swamps
streams
nor
mountains
when
he
paused
to
rest
he
would
mark
some
object
ahead
of
him
with
his
eye
in
order
that
on
getting
up
again
he
might
not
deviate
from
his
course
his
directors
had
told
him
of
a
hunter
cabin
about
midway
on
his
route
which
if
he
struck
he
might
be
sure
he
was
right
about
noon
this
cabin
was
reached
and
at
sunset
he
emerged
at
the
head
of
dry
brook
after
looking
in
vain
for
the
line
of
marked
trees
we
moved
off
to
the
left
in
a
doubtful
hesitating
manner
keeping
on
the
highest
ground
and
blazing
the
trees
as
we
went
we
were
afraid
to
go
downhill
lest
we
should
descend
to
soon
our
was
high
ground
a
thick
fog
coming
on
we
were
more
bewildered
than
ever
still
we
pressed
forward
climbing
up
ledges
and
wading
through
ferns
for
about
two
hours
when
we
paused
by
a
spring
that
issued
from
beneath
an
immense
wall
of
rock
that
belted
the
highest
part
of
the
mountain
there
was
quite
a
broad
plateau
here
and
the
birch
wood
was
very
dense
and
the
trees
of
unusual
size
after
resting
and
exchanging
opinions
we
all
concluded
that
is
was
best
not
to
continue
our
search
encumbered
as
we
were
but
we
were
not
willing
to
abandon
it
altogether
and
i
proposed
to
my
companions
to
leave
them
beside
the
spring
with
our
traps
while
i
made
one
thorough
and
final
effort
to
find
the
lake
if
i
succeeded
and
desired
them
to
come
forward
i
was
to
fire
my
gun
three
times
if
i
failed
and
wished
to
return
i
would
fire
twice
they
of
course
responding
so
filling
my
canteen
from
the
spring
i
set
out
again
taking
the
spring
run
for
my
guide
before
i
had
followed
it
two
hundred
yards
it
sank
into
the
ground
at
my
feet
i
had
half
a
mind
to
be
superstitious
and
to
believe
that
we
were
under
a
spell
since
our
guides
played
us
such
tricks
however
i
determined
to
put
the
matter
to
a
further
test
and
struck
out
boldly
to
the
left
this
seemed
to
be
the
keyword
to
the
left
to
the
left
the
fog
had
now
lifted
so
that
i
could
form
a
better
idea
of
the
lay
of
the
land
twice
i
looked
down
the
steep
sides
of
the
mountain
sorely
attempted
to
risk
a
plunge
still
i
hesitated
and
kept
along
on
the
brink
as
i
stood
on
a
rock
deliberating
i
heard
a
crackling
of
the
brush
like
the
tread
of
some
large
game
on
the
plateau
below
me
suspecting
the
truth
of
the
case
i
moved
stealthily
down
and
found
a
herd
of
young
cattle
leisurely
browsing
we
had
several
times
crossed
their
trail
and
had
seen
that
morning
a
level
grassy
place
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
where
they
had
passed
the
night
instead
of
being
frightened
as
i
had
expected
they
seemed
greatly
delighted
and
gathered
around
me
as
if
to
inquire
the
tidings
from
the
outer
world
perhaps
the
quotations
of
the
cattle
market
they
came
up
to
me
and
eagerly
licked
my
hand
clothes
and
gun
salt
was
what
they
were
after
and
they
were
ready
to
swallow
anything
that
contained
the
smallest
percentage
of
it
they
were
mostly
yearlings
and
as
sleek
as
moles
they
had
a
very
gamy
look
we
were
afterwards
told
that
in
the
spring
the
farmers
round
about
turn
into
these
woods
their
young
cattle
which
do
not
come
out
again
till
fall
they
are
then
in
good
condition
not
fat
like
cattle
but
trim
and
supple
like
deer
once
a
month
the
owner
hunts
them
up
and
salts
them
they
have
their
beats
and
seldom
wander
beyond
limits
it
was
interesting
to
see
them
feed
they
browsed
on
the
low
limbs
and
bushes
and
on
the
various
plants
munching
at
everything
without
any
apparent
discrimination
they
attempted
to
follow
me
but
i
escaped
them
by
clambering
down
some
steep
rocks
i
now
found
myself
gradually
edging
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
keeping
around
it
in
a
spiral
manner
and
scanning
the
woods
and
the
shape
of
the
ground
for
some
encouraging
hint
or
sign
finally
the
woods
became
more
open
and
the
descent
less
rapid
the
trees
were
remarkably
straight
and
uniform
in
size
black
birches
the
first
i
had
ever
seen
were
very
numerous
i
felt
encouraged
listening
attentively
i
caught
from
a
breeze
just
lifting
the
drooping
leaves
a
sound
that
i
willingly
believed
was
made
by
a
bullfrog
on
this
hint
i
tore
down
through
the
woods
at
my
highest
speed
then
i
paused
and
listened
again
this
time
there
was
no
mistaking
it
it
was
the
sound
of
frogs
much
elated
i
rushed
on
by
and
by
i
could
hear
them
as
i
ran
pthrung
pthrung
croaked
the
old
ones
pug
pug
shrilly
joined
in
the
smaller
fry
then
i
caught
through
the
lower
trees
a
gleam
of
blue
which
i
first
thought
was
distant
sky
a
second
look
and
i
knew
it
to
be
water
and
in
a
moment
more
i
stepped
from
the
woods
and
stood
upon
the
shore
of
the
lake
i
exulted
silently
there
it
was
at
last
sparkling
in
the
morning
sun
and
as
beautiful
as
a
dream
it
was
so
good
to
come
upon
such
open
space
and
such
bright
hues
after
wandering
in
the
dim
dense
woods
the
eye
is
as
delighted
as
an
escaped
bird
and
darts
gleefully
from
point
to
point
the
lake
was
a
long
oval
scarcely
more
than
a
mile
in
circumference
with
evenly
wooded
shores
which
rose
gradually
on
all
sides
after
contemplating
the
serene
for
a
moment
i
stepped
back
into
the
woods
and
loading
my
gun
as
heavily
as
i
dared
discharged
it
three
times
the
reports
seemed
to
fill
all
the
mountains
with
sound
the
frogs
quickly
hushed
and
i
listened
for
the
response
but
no
response
came
then
i
tried
again
and
again
but
without
evoking
an
answer
one
of
my
companions
however
who
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
high
rocks
in
the
rear
of
the
spring
thought
he
heard
faintly
one
report
it
seemed
an
immense
distance
below
him
and
far
around
under
the
mountain
i
knew
i
had
come
a
long
way
and
hardly
expected
to
be
able
to
communicate
with
my
companions
in
the
manner
agreed
upon
i
therefore
started
back
choosing
my
course
without
any
reference
to
the
circuitous
route
by
which
i
had
come
and
loading
heavily
and
firing
at
intervals
i
must
have
aroused
many
echoes
from
a
rip
van
winkle
sleep
as
my
powder
got
low
i
fired
and
halloed
alternately
till
i
cam
near
splitting
both
my
throat
and
gun
finally
after
i
had
begun
to
have
a
very
ugly
feeling
of
alarm
and
disappointment
and
to
cast
about
vaguely
for
some
course
to
pursue
in
an
emergency
that
seemed
near
at
hand
namely
the
loss
of
my
companions
now
i
had
found
the
lake
a
favoring
breeze
brought
me
the
last
echo
of
a
response
i
rejoined
with
spirit
and
hastened
with
all
speed
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
had
come
but
after
repeated
trials
failed
to
elicit
another
answering
sound
this
filled
me
with
apprehension
again
i
feared
that
my
friends
had
been
mislead
by
the
reverberations
and
i
pictured
them
to
myself
hastening
in
the
opposite
direction
paying
little
attention
to
my
course
but
paying
dearly
for
my
carelessness
afterward
i
rushed
forward
to
undeceive
them
but
they
had
not
been
deceived
and
in
a
few
moments
an
answering
shout
revealed
them
near
at
hand
i
heard
their
tramp
the
bushed
parted
and
we
three
met
again
in
answer
to
their
eager
inquiries
i
assured
them
that
i
had
seen
the
lake
that
it
was
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
that
we
could
not
miss
it
if
we
kept
straight
down
from
where
we
then
were
my
clothes
were
soaked
in
perspiration
but
i
shouldered
my
knapsack
with
alacrity
and
we
began
the
descent
i
noticed
that
the
woods
were
much
thicker
and
had
quite
a
different
look
from
those
i
had
passed
through
but
thought
nothing
of
it
as
i
expected
to
strike
the
lake
near
its
head
whereas
i
had
before
come
out
at
its
foot
we
had
not
gone
far
when
we
crossed
a
line
of
marked
trees
which
my
companions
were
disposed
to
follow
it
intersected
our
course
nearly
at
right
angles
and
kept
along
and
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
my
impression
was
that
it
lead
up
from
the
lake
and
that
by
keeping
our
course
we
should
reach
the
lake
sooner
than
if
we
followed
this
line
about
halfway
down
the
mountain
we
could
see
through
the
interstices
the
opposite
slope
i
encouraged
my
comrades
by
telling
them
that
the
lake
was
between
us
and
that
and
not
more
than
half
a
mile
distant
we
soon
reached
the
bottom
where
we
found
a
small
stream
and
quite
an
extensive
alder
swamp
evidently
the
ancient
bed
of
a
lake
i
explained
to
my
and
companions
that
we
were
probably
above
the
lake
and
that
this
stream
must
lead
to
it
follow
it
they
said
we
will
wait
here
till
we
hear
from
you
so
i
went
on
more
than
ever
disposed
to
believe
that
we
were
under
a
spell
and
that
the
lake
had
slipped
from
my
grasp
after
all
seeing
no
favorable
sign
as
i
went
forward
i
laid
down
my
accoutrements
and
climbed
a
decayed
beech
that
leaned
out
over
the
swamp
and
promised
a
good
view
from
the
top
as
i
stretched
myself
up
to
look
around
from
the
highest
attainable
branch
there
was
suddenly
a
loud
crack
at
the
root
with
a
celerity
that
would
at
least
have
done
credit
to
a
bear
i
regained
the
ground
having
caught
but
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
country
but
enough
to
convince
me
no
lake
was
near
leaving
all
incumbrances
here
but
my
gun
i
still
pressed
on
loath
to
be
thus
baffled
after
floundering
through
another
alder
swamp
for
nearly
half
a
mile
i
flattered
myself
that
i
was
close
to
the
lake
i
caught
sight
of
a
low
spur
of
the
mountain
sweeping
around
like
a
arm
and
i
fondly
imagined
that
within
its
clasp
was
the
object
of
my
search
but
i
found
only
more
alder
swamp
after
this
region
was
cleared
the
creek
began
to
descend
the
mountain
very
rapidly
its
banks
became
high
and
narrow
and
it
went
whirling
away
with
a
sound
that
seemed
to
my
ears
like
a
burst
of
ironical
laughter
i
turned
back
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
disgust
shame
and
vexation
in
fact
i
was
almost
sick
and
when
i
reached
my
companions
after
an
absence
of
nearly
two
hours
hungry
fatigued
and
disheartened
i
would
have
sold
my
interest
in
thomas
lake
at
a
very
low
figure
for
the
first
time
i
heartily
wished
myself
well
out
of
the
woods
thomas
might
keep
his
lake
and
the
enchanters
guard
his
possession
i
doubted
if
he
had
ever
found
it
the
second
time
or
if
any
one
else
ever
had
my
companions
who
were
quite
fresh
and
who
had
not
felt
the
strain
of
baffled
purpose
as
i
had
assumed
a
more
encouraging
tone
after
i
had
rested
awhile
and
partaken
sparingly
of
the
bread
and
whisky
which
in
such
an
emergency
is
a
great
improvement
on
bread
and
water
i
agreed
to
their
proposition
that
we
should
make
another
attempt
as
if
to
reassure
us
a
robin
sounded
his
cheery
call
near
by
and
the
winter
wren
the
first
i
had
ever
heard
in
these
woods
set
his
going
which
fairly
ran
over
with
fin
gushing
lyrical
sounds
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
this
bird
is
one
of
our
finest
songsters
if
it
would
only
thrive
and
sing
well
when
caged
like
the
canary
how
far
it
would
surpass
that
bird
it
has
all
the
vivacity
and
versatility
of
the
canary
without
any
of
its
shrillness
its
song
is
indeed
a
little
cascade
of
melody
we
again
retraced
our
steps
rolling
the
stone
as
it
were
back
up
the
mountain
determined
to
commit
ourselves
to
the
line
of
marked
trees
these
we
finally
reached
and
after
exploring
the
country
to
the
right
saw
that
bearing
to
the
left
was
still
the
order
the
trail
led
up
over
a
gentle
rise
of
ground
and
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
we
were
in
the
woods
i
had
passed
through
when
i
found
the
lake
the
error
i
had
made
was
then
plain
we
had
come
off
the
mountain
a
few
paces
too
far
to
the
right
and
so
had
passed
down
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
ridge
into
what
we
afterwards
learned
was
the
valley
of
alder
creek
we
now
made
good
time
and
before
many
minutes
i
again
saw
the
mimic
sky
glance
through
the
trees
as
we
approached
the
lake
a
solitary
woodchuck
the
first
wild
animal
we
had
seen
since
entering
the
woods
sat
crouched
upon
the
root
of
a
tree
a
few
feet
from
the
water
apparently
completely
nonplused
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
danger
on
the
land
side
all
retreat
was
cut
off
and
he
looked
his
fate
in
the
face
without
flinching
i
slaughtered
him
just
as
a
savage
would
have
done
and
from
the
same
motive
i
wanted
his
carcass
to
eat
the
sun
was
now
shining
upon
the
lake
and
a
low
steady
breeze
drove
the
little
waves
rocking
to
the
shore
a
herd
of
cattle
were
browsing
on
the
other
side
and
the
bell
of
the
leader
sounded
across
the
water
in
these
solitudes
its
clang
was
wild
and
musical
to
try
the
trout
was
the
first
thing
in
order
on
a
rude
raft
of
log
which
we
found
moored
at
the
shore
and
which
with
two
aboard
shipped
about
a
food
of
water
we
floated
out
and
wet
our
first
fly
in
thomas
lake
but
the
trout
refused
to
jump
and
to
be
frank
not
more
than
a
dozen
and
a
half
were
caught
during
our
stay
only
a
week
previous
a
party
of
three
had
taken
in
a
few
hours
all
the
fish
they
could
carry
out
of
the
woods
and
had
nearly
surfeited
their
neighbors
with
trout
but
from
some
cause
they
now
refused
to
rise
or
to
touch
any
kind
of
bait
so
we
fell
to
catching
the
sunfish
which
were
small
but
very
abundant
their
nests
were
all
along
the
shore
a
space
about
the
size
of
a
was
cleared
of
sediment
and
decayed
vegetable
matter
revealing
the
pebbly
bottom
fresh
and
bright
with
one
or
two
fish
suspended
over
the
centre
of
it
keeping
watch
and
ward
if
an
intruder
approached
they
would
dart
at
him
spitefully
these
fish
have
the
air
of
bantam
cocks
and
with
their
sharp
prickly
fins
and
spines
and
scaly
sides
must
be
ugly
customers
in
a
encounter
with
other
finny
warriors
to
a
hungry
man
they
look
about
as
unpromising
as
hemlock
slivers
so
thorny
and
thin
are
they
yet
there
is
sweet
meat
in
them
as
we
found
that
day
much
refreshed
i
set
out
with
the
sun
low
in
the
west
to
explore
the
outlet
of
the
lake
and
try
for
trout
there
while
my
companions
made
further
trials
in
the
lake
itself
the
outlet
as
is
usual
in
bodies
of
water
of
this
kind
was
very
gentle
and
private
the
stream
six
or
eight
feet
wide
flowed
silently
and
evenly
along
for
a
distance
of
three
or
four
rods
when
it
suddenly
as
if
conscious
of
its
freedom
took
a
leap
down
some
rocks
thence
as
far
as
i
followed
it
its
decent
was
very
rapid
through
a
continuous
succession
of
brief
falls
like
so
many
steps
down
the
mountain
its
appearance
promised
more
trout
than
i
found
though
i
returned
to
camp
with
a
very
respectable
string
toward
sunset
i
went
round
to
explore
the
inlet
and
found
that
as
usual
the
stream
wound
leisurely
through
marshy
ground
the
water
being
much
colder
than
in
the
outlet
the
trout
were
more
plentiful
as
i
was
picking
my
way
over
the
miry
ground
and
through
the
rank
growths
a
ruffed
grouse
hopped
up
on
a
fallen
branch
a
few
paces
before
me
and
jerking
his
tail
threatened
to
take
flight
but
as
i
was
at
the
moment
gunless
and
remained
stationary
he
presently
jumped
down
and
walked
away
a
seeker
of
birds
and
ever
on
the
alert
for
some
new
acquaintance
my
attention
was
arrested
on
first
entering
the
swamp
by
a
bright
lively
song
or
warble
that
issued
from
the
branches
overhead
and
that
was
entirely
new
to
me
though
there
was
something
in
the
tone
that
told
me
the
bird
was
related
to
the
and
to
the
or
thrush
the
strain
was
emphatic
and
quite
loud
like
the
canary
but
very
brief
the
bird
kept
itself
well
secreted
in
the
upper
branches
of
the
trees
and
for
a
long
time
eluded
my
eye
i
passed
to
and
fro
several
times
and
it
seemed
to
break
out
afresh
as
i
approached
a
certain
little
bend
in
the
creek
and
to
cease
after
i
had
got
beyond
it
no
doubt
its
nest
was
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
after
some
delay
the
bird
was
sighted
and
brought
down
it
proved
to
be
the
small
or
northern
called
also
the
new
york
a
new
bird
to
me
in
size
it
was
noticeably
smaller
than
the
large
or
louisiana
as
described
by
audubon
but
in
other
respects
its
general
appearance
was
the
same
it
was
a
great
treat
to
me
and
again
i
felt
myself
in
luck
this
bird
was
unknown
to
the
older
ornithologists
and
is
but
poorly
described
by
the
new
it
builds
a
mossy
nest
on
the
ground
or
under
the
edge
of
a
decayed
log
a
correspondent
writes
me
that
he
has
found
it
breeding
on
the
mountains
in
pennsylvania
the
is
much
the
superior
songster
but
the
present
species
has
a
very
bright
and
cheerful
strain
the
specimen
i
saw
contrary
to
the
habits
of
the
family
kept
in
the
treetops
like
a
warbler
and
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
catching
insects
the
birds
were
unusually
plentiful
and
noisy
about
the
head
of
this
lake
robins
blue
jays
and
woodpeckers
greeted
me
with
their
familiar
notes
the
blue
jays
found
an
owl
or
some
wild
animal
a
short
distance
above
me
and
as
is
their
custom
on
such
occasions
proclaimed
it
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
kept
on
till
the
darkness
began
to
gather
in
the
woods
i
also
heard
as
i
had
at
two
or
three
other
points
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
peculiar
resonant
hammering
of
some
species
of
woodpecker
upon
the
hard
dry
limbs
it
was
unlike
any
sound
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
heard
and
repeated
at
intervals
through
the
silent
wood
was
a
very
marked
and
characteristic
feature
its
peculiarity
was
the
ordered
succession
of
the
raps
which
gave
it
the
character
of
a
premeditated
performance
there
were
first
three
strokes
following
each
other
rapidly
then
two
much
louder
ones
with
longer
intervals
between
them
i
heard
the
drumming
here
and
the
next
day
at
sunset
at
furlow
lake
the
source
of
dry
brook
and
in
no
instance
was
the
order
varied
there
was
a
melody
in
it
such
as
a
woodpecker
knows
how
to
evoke
from
a
smooth
dry
branch
it
suggested
something
quite
as
pleasing
as
the
liveliest
and
was
if
anything
more
woodsy
and
wild
as
the
woodpecker
was
the
most
abundant
species
in
these
woods
i
attributed
it
to
him
it
is
the
one
sound
that
still
links
itself
with
those
scenes
in
my
mind
at
sunset
the
grouse
began
to
drum
in
all
parts
of
the
woods
about
the
lake
i
could
hear
five
at
one
time
thump
thump
thump
thump
it
was
a
homely
welcome
sound
as
i
returned
to
camp
at
twilight
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
the
frogs
also
were
in
full
chorus
the
older
ones
ripped
out
their
responses
to
each
other
with
terrific
force
and
volume
i
know
of
no
other
animal
capable
of
giving
forth
so
much
sound
in
proportion
to
its
size
as
a
frog
some
of
these
seemed
to
bellow
as
loud
as
a
bull
they
were
of
immense
size
and
very
abundant
no
had
ever
been
there
near
the
shore
we
felled
a
tree
which
reached
far
out
in
the
lake
upon
the
trunk
and
branches
the
frogs
soon
collected
in
large
numbers
and
gamboled
and
splashed
about
the
half
submerged
top
like
a
parcel
of
schoolboys
making
nearly
as
much
noise
after
dark
as
i
was
frying
the
fish
a
panful
of
the
largest
trout
was
accidently
capsized
in
the
fire
with
rueful
countenances
we
contemplated
the
irreparable
loss
our
commissariat
had
sustained
by
this
mishap
but
remembering
there
was
virtue
in
ashes
we
poked
the
fish
from
the
bed
of
coals
and
ate
them
and
they
were
good
we
lodged
that
night
on
a
and
slept
soundly
the
green
yielding
covered
with
a
buffalo
robe
were
equal
to
a
hair
mattress
the
heat
and
smoke
from
a
large
fire
kindled
in
the
afternoon
had
banished
every
from
the
locality
and
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
above
the
mountain
before
we
awoke
i
immediately
started
again
for
the
inlet
and
went
far
up
the
stream
toward
its
source
a
fair
string
of
trout
for
breakfast
was
my
reward
the
cattle
with
the
bell
were
at
the
head
of
the
valley
where
they
had
passed
the
night
most
of
them
were
steers
they
came
up
to
me
and
begged
for
salt
and
scared
the
fish
by
their
importunities
we
finished
our
bread
that
morning
and
ate
every
fish
we
could
catch
and
about
ten
prepared
to
leave
the
lake
the
weather
had
been
admirable
and
the
lake
as
a
gem
and
i
would
gladly
have
spent
a
week
in
the
neighborhood
but
the
question
of
supplies
was
a
serious
one
and
would
brook
no
delay
when
we
reached
on
our
return
the
point
where
we
had
crossed
the
line
of
marked
trees
the
day
before
the
question
arose
whether
we
should
still
trust
ourselves
to
this
line
or
follow
our
own
trail
back
to
the
spring
and
the
battlement
of
rocks
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
thence
to
the
rock
where
the
guide
had
left
us
we
decided
in
favor
of
the
former
course
after
a
march
of
three
quarters
of
an
hour
the
blazed
trees
ceased
and
we
concluded
we
were
near
the
point
at
which
we
had
parted
with
our
guide
so
we
built
a
fire
laid
down
our
loads
and
cast
about
on
all
sides
for
some
clew
as
to
our
exact
locality
nearly
an
hour
was
consumed
in
this
manner
and
without
any
result
i
came
upon
a
brood
of
young
grouse
which
diverted
me
for
a
moment
the
old
one
blustered
about
at
a
furious
rate
trying
to
draw
all
attention
to
herself
while
the
young
ones
which
were
unable
to
fly
hid
themselves
she
whined
like
a
dog
in
great
distress
and
dragged
herself
along
apparently
with
the
greatest
difficulty
as
i
pursued
her
she
ran
very
nimbly
and
presently
flew
a
few
yards
then
as
i
went
on
she
flew
farther
and
farther
each
time
till
at
last
she
got
up
and
went
humming
through
the
woods
as
if
she
had
no
interest
in
them
i
went
back
and
caught
one
of
the
young
which
had
simply
squatted
close
to
the
ground
i
then
put
in
my
coatsleeve
when
it
ran
and
nestled
in
my
armpit
when
we
met
at
the
sign
of
the
smoke
opinions
differed
as
to
the
most
feasible
course
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
we
could
get
out
of
the
woods
but
we
wished
to
get
out
speedily
and
as
near
as
possible
to
the
point
where
we
had
entered
half
ashamed
of
our
timidity
and
indecision
we
finally
tramped
away
back
to
where
we
had
crossed
the
line
of
blazed
trees
followed
our
old
trail
to
the
spring
on
the
top
of
the
range
and
after
much
searching
and
scouring
to
the
right
and
left
found
ourselves
at
the
very
place
we
had
left
two
hours
before
another
deliberation
and
a
divided
council
but
something
must
be
done
it
was
then
and
the
prospect
of
spending
another
night
on
the
mountains
without
food
or
drink
was
not
pleasant
so
we
moved
down
the
ridge
here
another
line
of
marked
trees
was
found
the
course
of
which
formed
an
obtuse
angle
with
the
one
we
had
followed
it
kept
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
for
perhaps
a
mile
when
it
disappeared
and
we
were
as
much
adrift
as
ever
then
one
of
the
party
swore
an
oath
and
said
he
was
going
out
of
those
woods
hit
or
miss
and
wheeling
to
the
right
instantly
plunged
over
the
brink
of
the
mountain
the
rest
followed
but
would
fain
have
paused
and
ciphered
away
at
their
own
uncertainties
to
see
if
a
certainty
could
not
be
arrived
at
as
to
where
we
would
come
out
but
our
bold
leader
was
solving
the
problem
in
the
right
way
down
and
down
and
still
down
we
went
as
if
we
were
to
bring
up
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
it
was
by
far
the
steepest
descent
we
had
made
and
we
felt
a
grim
satisfaction
in
knowing
we
could
not
retrace
our
steps
this
time
be
the
issue
what
it
might
as
we
paused
on
the
brink
of
a
ledge
of
rocks
we
chanced
to
see
through
the
trees
distant
cleared
land
a
house
or
barn
also
was
dimly
descried
this
was
encouraging
but
we
could
not
make
out
whether
it
was
on
beaver
kill
or
mill
brook
or
dry
brook
and
did
not
long
stop
to
consider
where
it
was
we
at
last
brought
up
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
gorge
through
which
flowed
a
rapid
creek
that
literally
swarmed
with
trout
but
we
were
in
no
mood
to
catch
them
and
pushed
on
along
the
channel
of
the
stream
sometimes
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
and
sometimes
splashing
heedlessly
through
the
water
and
speculating
the
while
as
to
where
we
should
probably
come
out
on
the
beaver
kill
my
companions
thought
but
from
the
position
of
the
sun
i
said
on
the
mill
brook
about
six
miles
below
our
team
for
i
remembered
having
seen
in
coming
up
this
stream
a
deep
wild
valley
that
led
up
into
the
mountains
like
this
one
soon
the
banks
of
the
stream
became
lower
and
we
moved
into
the
woods
here
we
entered
upon
an
obscure
which
presently
conducted
us
into
the
midst
of
a
vast
hemlock
forest
the
land
had
a
gentle
slope
and
we
wondered
by
the
lumbermen
and
barkmen
who
prowl
through
these
woods
had
left
this
fine
tract
untouched
beyond
this
the
forest
was
mostly
birch
and
maple
we
were
now
close
to
settlement
and
began
to
hear
human
sounds
one
rod
more
and
we
were
out
of
the
woods
it
took
us
a
moment
to
comprehend
the
scene
things
looked
very
strange
at
first
but
quickly
they
began
to
change
and
to
put
on
familiar
features
some
magic
seemed
to
take
place
before
my
eyes
till
instead
of
the
unknown
settlement
which
i
had
at
first
seemed
to
look
upon
there
stood
the
farmhouse
at
which
we
had
stopped
two
days
before
and
at
the
same
moment
we
heard
the
stamping
of
our
team
in
the
barn
we
sat
down
and
laughed
heartily
over
our
good
luck
our
desperate
venture
had
resulted
better
than
we
had
dared
to
hope
and
had
shamed
our
wisest
plans
at
the
house
our
arrival
had
been
anticipated
about
this
time
and
dinner
was
being
put
upon
the
table
it
was
then
five
so
that
we
had
been
in
the
woods
just
hours
but
if
time
is
only
phenomenal
as
the
philosophers
say
and
life
only
in
feeling
as
the
poets
aver
we
were
some
months
if
not
years
older
at
that
moment
than
we
had
been
two
days
before
yet
younger
too
though
this
be
a
paradox
for
the
birches
had
infused
into
us
some
of
their
own
suppleness
and
strength
vii
the
bluebird
when
nature
made
the
bluebird
she
wished
to
propitiate
both
the
sky
and
the
earth
so
she
gave
him
the
color
of
the
one
on
his
back
and
the
hue
of
the
other
on
his
breast
and
ordained
that
his
appearance
in
the
spring
should
denote
that
the
strife
and
war
between
these
two
elements
was
at
an
end
he
is
the
in
him
the
celestial
and
terrestrial
strike
hands
and
are
fast
friends
he
means
the
furrow
and
he
means
the
warmth
he
means
all
the
soft
wooing
influences
of
the
spring
on
one
hand
and
the
retreating
footsteps
of
winter
on
the
other
it
is
sure
to
be
a
bright
march
morning
when
you
first
hear
his
note
and
it
is
as
if
the
milder
influences
up
above
had
found
a
voice
and
let
a
word
fall
upon
your
ear
so
tender
is
it
and
so
prophetic
a
hope
tinged
with
a
regret
bermuda
bermuda
bermuda
he
seems
to
say
as
if
both
invoking
and
lamenting
and
behold
bermuda
follows
close
though
the
little
pilgrim
may
only
be
repeating
the
tradition
of
his
race
himself
having
come
only
from
florida
the
carolinas
or
even
from
virginia
where
he
has
found
his
bermuda
on
some
broad
sunny
hillside
thickly
studded
with
cedars
and
in
new
york
and
in
new
england
the
sap
starts
up
in
the
sugar
maple
the
very
day
the
bluebird
arrives
and
begins
forthwith
the
bird
is
generally
a
mere
disembodied
voice
a
rumor
in
the
air
for
tow
of
three
days
before
it
takes
visible
shape
before
you
the
males
are
the
pioneers
and
come
several
days
in
advance
of
the
females
by
the
time
both
are
here
and
the
pairs
have
begun
to
prospect
for
a
place
to
nest
is
over
the
last
vestige
of
snow
has
disappeared
and
the
plow
is
brightening
its
in
the
new
furrow
the
bluebird
enjoys
the
preëminence
of
being
the
first
bit
of
color
that
cheers
our
northern
landscape
the
other
birds
that
arrive
about
the
same
time
the
sparrow
the
robin
the
are
clad
in
neutral
tints
gray
brown
or
russet
but
the
bluebird
brings
one
of
the
primary
hues
and
the
divinest
of
them
all
this
bird
also
has
the
distinction
of
answering
very
nearly
to
the
robin
redbreast
of
english
memory
and
was
by
the
early
settlers
of
new
england
christened
the
blue
robin
it
is
a
size
or
two
larger
and
the
ruddy
hue
of
its
breast
does
not
verge
so
nearly
on
an
orange
but
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
two
birds
are
very
much
alike
our
bird
has
the
softer
voice
but
the
english
redbreast
is
much
the
more
skilled
musician
he
has
indeed
a
fine
animated
warble
heard
nearly
the
year
through
about
english
gardens
and
along
the
old
that
is
quite
beyond
the
compass
of
our
bird
instrument
on
the
other
hand
our
bird
is
associated
with
the
spring
as
the
british
species
can
not
be
being
a
winter
resident
also
while
the
brighter
sun
and
sky
of
the
new
world
have
given
him
a
coat
that
far
surpasses
that
of
his
transatlantic
cousin
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
among
british
birds
there
is
no
blue
bird
the
cerulean
tint
seems
much
rarer
among
the
feathered
tribes
there
than
here
on
this
continent
there
are
at
least
three
species
of
the
common
bluebird
while
in
all
our
woods
there
is
the
blue
jay
and
the
the
latter
so
intensely
blue
as
to
fully
justify
its
name
there
is
also
the
blue
grosbeak
not
much
behind
the
in
intensity
of
color
and
among
our
warblers
the
blue
tint
is
very
common
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
the
bluebird
is
not
confined
to
any
one
section
of
the
country
and
that
when
one
goes
west
he
will
still
have
this
favorite
with
him
though
a
little
changed
in
voice
and
color
just
enough
to
give
variety
without
marring
the
identity
the
western
bluebird
is
considered
a
distinct
species
and
is
perhaps
a
little
more
brilliant
and
showy
than
its
eastern
brother
and
nuttall
thinks
its
song
is
more
varied
sweet
and
tender
its
color
approaches
to
ultramarine
while
it
has
a
sash
of
across
its
shoulders
all
the
effects
i
suspect
of
that
wonderful
air
and
sky
of
california
and
of
those
great
western
plains
or
if
one
goes
a
little
higher
up
into
the
mountainous
regions
of
the
west
he
finds
the
arctic
bluebird
the
ruddy
brown
on
the
breast
changed
to
a
greenish
blue
and
the
wings
longer
and
more
pointed
in
other
respects
not
differing
much
from
our
species
the
bluebird
usually
builds
its
nest
in
a
hole
in
a
stump
or
stub
or
in
an
old
cavity
excavated
by
a
woodpecker
when
such
can
be
had
but
its
first
impulse
seems
to
be
to
start
in
the
world
in
much
more
style
and
the
happy
pair
make
a
great
show
of
about
the
farm
buildings
now
half
persuaded
to
appropriate
a
then
discussing
in
a
lively
manner
a
last
year
swallow
nest
or
proclaiming
with
much
flourish
and
flutter
that
they
have
taken
the
wren
house
or
the
tenement
of
the
purple
martin
till
finally
nature
becomes
too
urgent
when
all
this
pretty
ceases
and
most
of
them
settle
back
upon
the
old
family
stumps
and
knotholes
in
remote
fields
and
go
to
work
in
earnest
in
such
situations
the
female
is
easily
captured
by
approaching
very
stealthily
and
covering
the
entrance
to
the
nest
the
bird
seldom
makes
any
effort
to
escape
seeing
how
hopeless
the
case
is
and
keeps
her
place
on
the
nest
till
she
feels
your
hand
closing
around
her
i
have
looked
down
into
the
cavity
and
seen
the
poor
thing
palpitating
with
fear
and
looking
up
with
distended
eyes
but
never
moving
till
i
had
withdrawn
a
few
paces
then
she
rushes
out
with
a
cry
that
brings
the
male
on
the
scene
in
a
hurry
he
warbles
and
lifts
his
wings
beseechingly
but
shows
no
anger
or
disposition
to
scold
and
complain
like
most
birds
indeed
this
bird
seems
incapable
of
uttering
a
harsh
note
or
of
doing
a
spiteful
thing
the
all
have
some
art
or
device
to
decoy
one
away
from
the
nest
affecting
lameness
a
crippled
wing
or
a
broken
back
promising
an
easy
capture
if
pursued
the
depend
upon
concealing
the
nest
or
placing
it
beyond
reach
but
the
bluebird
has
no
art
either
way
and
its
nest
is
easily
found
about
the
only
enemies
of
the
sitting
bird
or
the
nest
is
in
danger
of
are
snakes
and
squirrels
i
knew
of
a
who
was
in
the
habit
of
putting
his
hand
down
into
a
bluebird
nest
and
taking
out
the
old
bird
whenever
he
came
that
way
one
day
he
put
his
hand
in
and
feeling
something
peculiar
withdrew
it
hastily
when
it
was
instantly
followed
by
the
head
of
an
enormous
black
snake
the
boy
took
to
his
heels
and
the
snake
gave
chase
pressing
him
close
till
a
plowman
near
by
came
to
the
rescue
with
his
there
never
was
a
happier
or
more
devoted
husband
than
the
male
bluebird
is
but
among
nearly
all
our
familiar
birds
the
serious
cares
of
life
seem
to
devolve
almost
entirely
upon
the
female
the
male
is
hilarious
and
demonstrative
the
female
serious
and
anxious
about
her
charge
the
male
is
the
attendant
of
the
female
following
her
wherever
she
goes
he
never
leads
never
directs
but
only
seconds
and
applauds
if
his
life
is
all
poetry
and
romance
hers
is
all
business
and
prose
she
has
no
pleasure
but
her
duty
and
no
duty
but
to
look
after
her
nest
and
brood
she
shows
no
affection
for
the
male
no
pleasure
in
his
society
she
only
tolerates
him
as
a
necessary
evil
and
if
he
is
killed
goes
in
quest
of
another
in
the
most
manner
as
you
would
go
for
the
plumber
or
the
glazier
in
most
cases
the
male
is
the
ornamental
partner
in
the
firm
and
contributes
little
of
the
working
capital
there
seems
to
be
more
equality
of
the
sexes
among
the
woodpeckers
wrens
and
swallows
while
the
contrast
is
greatest
perhaps
in
the
bobolink
family
where
the
courting
is
done
in
the
arab
fashion
the
female
fleeing
with
all
her
speed
and
the
male
pursuing
with
equal
precipitation
and
were
it
not
for
the
broods
of
young
birds
that
appear
it
would
be
hard
to
believe
that
the
intercourse
ever
ripened
into
anything
more
intimate
with
the
bluebirds
the
male
is
useful
as
well
as
ornamental
he
is
the
gay
champion
and
escort
of
the
female
at
all
times
and
while
she
is
sitting
he
feeds
her
regularly
it
is
very
pretty
to
watch
them
building
their
nest
the
male
is
very
active
in
hunting
out
a
place
and
exploring
the
boxes
and
cavities
but
seems
to
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
and
is
anxious
only
to
please
and
to
encourage
his
mate
who
has
the
practical
turn
and
knows
what
will
do
and
what
will
not
after
she
has
suited
herself
he
applauds
her
immensely
and
away
the
two
go
in
quest
of
material
for
the
nest
the
male
acting
as
guard
and
flying
above
and
in
advance
of
the
female
she
brings
all
the
material
and
does
all
the
work
of
building
he
looking
on
and
encouraging
her
with
gesture
and
song
he
acts
also
as
inspector
of
her
work
but
i
fear
is
a
very
partial
one
she
enters
the
nest
with
her
bit
of
dry
grass
or
straw
and
having
adjusted
it
to
her
notion
withdraws
and
waits
near
by
while
he
goes
in
and
looks
it
over
on
coming
out
he
exclaims
very
plainly
excellent
excellent
and
away
the
two
go
again
for
more
material
the
bluebirds
when
they
build
about
the
farm
buildings
sometimes
come
into
contact
with
the
swallows
the
past
season
i
knew
a
pair
to
take
forcible
possession
of
the
domicile
of
a
pair
of
the
latter
the
cliff
species
that
now
stick
their
nests
under
the
eaves
of
the
barn
the
bluebirds
had
been
broken
up
in
a
little
near
by
by
the
rats
or
perhaps
a
weasel
and
being
no
doubt
in
a
bad
humor
and
the
season
being
well
advanced
they
made
forcible
entrance
into
the
adobe
tenement
of
their
neighbors
and
held
possession
of
it
for
some
days
but
i
believe
finally
withdrew
rather
than
live
amid
such
a
squeaky
noisy
colony
i
have
heard
that
these
swallows
when
ejected
from
their
homes
in
that
way
by
the
have
been
known
to
fall
to
and
mason
up
the
entrance
to
the
nest
while
their
enemy
was
inside
of
it
thus
having
a
revenge
as
complete
and
cruel
as
anything
in
human
annals
the
bluebirds
and
the
house
wrens
more
frequently
come
into
collision
a
few
years
ago
i
put
up
a
little
in
the
back
end
of
my
garden
for
the
accommodation
of
the
wrens
and
every
season
a
pair
of
bluebirds
looked
into
the
tenement
and
lingered
about
several
days
leading
me
to
hope
that
they
would
conclude
to
occupy
it
but
they
finally
went
away
and
later
in
the
season
the
wrens
appeared
and
after
a
little
coquetting
were
regularly
installed
in
their
old
quarters
and
were
as
happy
as
only
wrens
can
be
one
of
our
younger
poets
myron
benton
saw
a
little
bird
ruffled
with
whirlwind
of
his
ecstasies
which
must
have
been
the
wren
as
i
know
of
no
other
bird
that
so
throbs
and
palpitates
with
music
as
this
little
vagabond
and
the
pair
i
speak
of
seemed
exceptionally
happy
and
the
male
had
a
small
tornado
of
song
in
his
crop
that
kept
him
ruffled
every
moment
in
the
day
but
before
their
honeymoon
was
over
the
bluebirds
returned
i
knew
something
was
wrong
before
i
was
up
in
the
morning
instead
of
that
voluble
and
gushing
song
outside
the
window
i
heard
the
wrens
scolding
and
crying
at
a
fearful
rate
and
on
going
out
saw
the
bluebirds
in
possession
of
the
box
the
poor
wrens
were
in
despair
they
wrung
their
hands
and
tore
their
hair
after
the
wren
fashion
but
chiefly
did
they
rattle
out
their
disgust
and
wrath
at
the
intruders
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
it
could
have
been
interpreted
it
would
have
proven
the
rankest
and
most
voluble
billingsgate
ever
uttered
for
the
wren
is
saucy
and
he
has
a
tongue
in
his
head
that
can
outwag
any
other
tongue
known
to
me
the
bluebirds
said
nothing
but
the
male
kept
an
eye
on
wren
and
when
he
came
to
near
gave
chase
driving
him
to
cover
under
the
fence
or
under
a
rubbish
heap
or
other
object
where
the
wren
would
scold
and
rattle
away
while
his
pursuer
sat
on
the
fence
or
the
waiting
for
him
to
reappear
days
passed
and
the
usurpers
prospered
and
the
outcasts
were
wretched
but
the
latter
lingered
about
watching
and
abusing
their
enemies
and
hoping
no
doubt
that
things
would
take
a
turn
as
they
presently
did
the
outraged
wrens
were
fully
avenged
the
mother
bluebird
had
laid
her
full
complement
of
eggs
and
was
beginning
to
set
when
one
day
as
her
mate
was
perched
above
her
on
the
barn
along
came
a
boy
with
one
of
those
wicked
elastic
slings
and
cut
him
down
with
a
pebble
there
he
lay
like
a
bit
of
sky
fallen
upon
the
grass
the
widowed
bird
seemed
to
understand
what
had
happened
and
without
much
ado
disappeared
next
day
in
quest
of
another
mate
how
she
contrived
to
make
her
wants
known
without
trumpeting
them
about
i
am
unable
to
say
but
i
presume
that
birds
have
a
way
of
advertising
that
answers
the
purpose
well
maybe
she
trusted
to
luck
to
fall
in
with
some
stray
bachelor
or
bereaved
male
who
would
undertake
to
console
a
widow
or
one
day
standing
i
will
say
in
passing
that
there
are
no
bachelors
from
choice
among
the
birds
they
are
all
rejected
suitors
while
old
maids
are
entirely
unknown
there
is
a
jack
to
every
jill
and
some
to
boot
the
males
being
more
exposed
by
their
song
and
plumage
and
by
being
the
pioneers
in
migrating
seem
to
be
slightly
in
excess
lest
the
supply
fall
short
and
hence
it
sometimes
happens
that
a
few
are
bachelors
perforce
there
are
not
females
enough
to
go
around
but
before
the
season
is
over
there
are
sure
to
be
some
vacancies
in
the
marital
ranks
which
they
are
called
on
to
fill
in
the
mean
time
the
wrens
were
beside
themselves
with
delight
they
fairly
screamed
with
joy
if
the
male
was
before
ruffled
with
whirlwind
of
his
ecstasies
he
was
now
in
danger
of
being
rent
asunder
he
inflated
his
throat
and
caroled
as
wren
never
caroled
before
and
the
female
too
how
she
cackled
and
darted
about
how
busy
they
both
were
rushing
into
the
nest
they
hustled
those
eggs
out
in
less
than
a
minute
wren
time
they
carried
in
new
material
and
by
the
third
day
were
fairly
installed
again
in
their
old
headquarters
but
on
the
third
day
so
rapidly
are
these
little
dramas
played
the
female
bluebird
reappeared
with
another
mate
ah
how
the
wren
stock
went
down
then
what
dismay
and
despair
filled
again
those
little
breasts
it
was
pitiful
they
did
not
scold
as
before
but
after
a
day
or
two
withdrew
from
the
garden
dumb
with
grief
and
gave
up
the
struggle
the
bluebird
finding
her
eggs
gone
and
her
nest
changed
seemed
suddenly
seized
with
alarm
and
shunned
the
box
or
else
finding
she
had
less
need
for
another
husband
than
she
thought
repented
her
rashness
and
wanted
to
dissolve
the
compact
but
the
happy
bridegroom
would
not
take
the
hint
and
exerted
all
his
eloquence
to
comfort
and
reassure
her
he
was
fresh
and
fond
and
until
this
bereaved
female
found
him
i
am
sure
his
suit
had
not
prospered
that
season
he
thought
the
box
just
the
thing
and
that
there
was
no
need
of
alarm
and
spent
days
in
trying
to
persuade
the
female
back
seeing
he
could
not
be
a
stepfather
to
a
family
he
was
quite
willing
to
assume
a
nearer
relation
he
hovered
about
the
box
he
went
in
and
out
he
called
he
warbled
he
entreated
the
female
would
respond
occasionally
and
come
and
alight
near
and
even
peep
into
the
nest
but
would
not
enter
it
and
quickly
flew
away
again
her
mate
would
reluctantly
follow
but
he
was
soon
back
uttering
the
most
confident
and
cheering
calls
if
she
did
not
come
he
would
perch
above
the
nest
and
sound
his
loudest
notes
over
and
over
again
looking
in
the
direction
of
his
mate
and
beckoning
with
every
motion
but
she
responded
less
and
less
frequently
some
days
i
would
see
him
only
but
finally
he
gave
it
up
the
pair
disappeared
and
the
box
remained
deserted
the
rest
of
the
summer
viii
the
invitation
years
ago
when
quite
a
youth
i
was
rambling
in
the
woods
one
sunday
with
my
brothers
gathering
black
birch
wintergreens
when
as
we
reclined
upon
the
ground
gazing
vaguely
up
into
the
trees
i
caught
sight
of
a
bird
that
paused
a
moment
on
a
branch
above
me
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
before
seen
or
heard
of
it
was
probably
the
blue
warbler
as
i
have
since
found
this
to
be
a
common
bird
in
those
woods
but
to
my
young
fancy
it
seemed
like
some
fairy
bird
so
unexpected
i
saw
it
a
moment
as
the
flickering
leaves
parted
noted
the
white
spot
on
its
wing
and
it
was
gone
how
the
thought
of
it
clung
to
me
afterward
it
was
a
revelation
it
was
the
first
intimation
i
had
had
that
the
woods
we
knew
so
well
held
birds
that
we
knew
not
at
all
were
our
eyes
and
ears
so
dull
then
there
was
the
robin
the
blue
jay
the
bluebird
the
the
the
catbird
the
the
woodpecker
the
an
occasional
redbird
and
a
few
others
in
the
woods
or
along
their
borders
but
who
ever
dreamed
that
there
were
still
others
that
not
even
the
hunters
saw
and
whose
names
no
one
had
ever
heard
when
one
summer
day
later
in
life
i
took
my
gun
and
went
to
the
woods
again
in
a
different
though
perhaps
a
less
simple
spirit
i
found
my
youthful
vision
more
than
realized
there
were
indeed
other
birds
plenty
of
them
singing
nesting
breeding
among
the
familiar
trees
which
i
had
before
passed
by
unheard
and
unseen
it
is
a
surprise
that
awaits
every
student
of
ornithology
and
the
thrill
of
delight
that
accompanies
it
and
the
feeling
of
fresh
eager
inquiry
that
follows
can
hardly
be
awakened
by
any
other
pursuit
take
the
first
step
in
ornithology
procure
one
new
specimen
and
you
are
ticketed
for
the
whole
voyage
there
is
a
fascination
about
it
quite
overpowering
it
fits
so
well
with
other
things
with
fishing
hunting
farming
walking
with
all
that
takes
one
to
the
fields
and
woods
one
may
go
and
make
some
rare
discovery
or
while
driving
his
cow
to
pasture
hear
a
new
song
or
make
a
new
observation
secrets
lurk
on
all
sides
there
is
news
in
every
bush
expectation
is
ever
on
tiptoe
what
no
man
ever
saw
before
may
the
next
moment
be
revealed
to
you
what
a
new
interest
the
woods
have
how
you
long
to
explore
every
nook
and
corner
of
them
you
would
even
find
consolation
in
being
lost
in
them
you
could
then
hear
the
night
birds
and
the
owls
and
in
your
wanderings
might
stumble
upon
some
unknown
specimen
in
all
excursions
to
the
woods
or
to
the
shore
the
student
of
ornithology
has
an
advantage
over
his
companions
he
has
one
more
resource
one
more
avenue
of
delight
he
indeed
kills
two
birds
with
one
stone
and
sometimes
three
if
others
wander
he
can
never
go
out
of
his
way
his
game
is
everywhere
the
cawing
of
a
crow
makes
him
feel
at
home
while
a
new
note
or
a
new
song
drowns
all
care
audubon
on
the
desolate
coast
of
labrador
is
happier
than
any
king
ever
was
and
on
shipboard
is
nearly
cured
of
his
seasickness
when
a
new
gull
appears
in
sight
one
must
taste
it
to
understand
or
appreciate
its
fascination
the
sees
nothing
to
inspire
such
enthusiasm
only
a
few
feathers
and
a
note
or
two
why
all
this
ado
who
would
give
a
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
to
know
about
the
birds
said
an
eastern
governor
half
contemptuously
to
wilson
as
the
latter
solicited
a
subscription
to
his
great
work
sure
enough
bought
knowledge
is
dear
at
any
price
the
most
precious
things
have
no
commercial
value
it
is
not
your
excellency
mere
technical
knowledge
of
the
birds
that
you
are
asked
to
purchase
but
a
new
interest
in
the
fields
and
the
woods
a
new
moral
and
intellectual
tonic
a
new
key
to
the
of
nature
think
of
the
many
other
things
your
excellency
would
get
the
air
the
sunshine
the
healing
fragrance
and
coolness
and
the
many
respites
from
the
knavery
and
turmoil
of
political
life
yesterday
was
an
october
day
of
rare
brightness
and
warmth
i
spent
the
most
of
it
in
a
wild
wooded
gorge
of
rock
creek
a
which
stood
upon
the
bank
had
dropped
some
of
its
fruit
in
the
water
as
i
stood
there
deep
picking
them
up
a
wood
duck
came
flying
down
the
creek
and
passed
over
my
head
presently
it
returned
flying
up
then
it
came
back
again
and
sweeping
low
around
a
bend
prepared
to
alight
in
a
still
dark
reach
in
the
creek
which
was
hidden
from
my
view
as
i
passed
that
way
about
half
an
hour
afterward
the
duck
started
up
uttering
its
wild
alarm
note
in
the
stillness
i
could
hear
the
whistle
of
its
wings
and
the
splash
of
the
water
when
it
took
flight
near
by
i
saw
where
a
raccoon
had
come
down
to
the
water
for
fresh
clams
leaving
his
long
sharp
track
in
the
mud
and
sand
before
i
had
passed
this
hidden
stretch
of
water
a
pair
of
those
mysterious
thrushes
the
flew
up
from
the
ground
and
perched
on
a
low
branch
who
can
tell
how
much
this
duck
this
footprint
in
the
sand
and
these
strange
thrushes
from
the
far
north
enhanced
the
interest
and
charm
of
the
autumn
woods
ornithology
can
not
be
satisfactorily
learned
from
the
books
the
satisfaction
is
in
learning
it
from
nature
one
must
have
an
original
experience
with
the
birds
the
books
are
only
the
guide
the
invitation
though
there
remain
not
another
new
species
to
describe
any
young
person
with
health
and
enthusiasm
has
open
to
him
or
her
the
whole
field
anew
and
is
eligible
to
experience
all
the
thrill
and
delight
of
the
original
discoverers
but
let
me
say
in
the
same
breath
that
the
books
can
by
no
manner
of
means
be
dispensed
with
a
copy
of
wilson
or
audubon
for
reference
and
to
compare
notes
with
is
invaluable
in
lieu
of
these
access
to
some
large
museum
or
collection
would
be
a
great
help
in
the
beginning
one
finds
it
very
difficult
to
identify
a
bird
from
any
verbal
description
reference
to
a
colored
plate
or
to
a
stuffed
specimen
at
once
settles
the
matter
this
is
the
chief
value
of
books
they
are
the
charts
to
sail
by
the
route
is
mapped
out
and
much
time
and
labor
are
thereby
saved
first
find
your
bird
observe
its
ways
its
song
its
calls
its
flight
its
haunts
then
shoot
it
not
ogle
it
with
a
glass
and
compare
it
with
audubon
footnote
my
later
experiences
have
led
me
to
prefer
a
small
to
a
gun
in
this
way
the
feathered
kingdom
may
soon
be
conquered
the
ornithologists
divide
and
subdivide
the
birds
into
a
great
many
orders
families
genera
species
which
at
first
sight
are
apt
to
confuse
and
discourage
the
reader
but
any
interested
person
can
acquaint
himself
with
most
of
our
by
keeping
in
mind
a
few
general
divisions
and
observing
the
characteristics
of
each
by
far
the
greater
number
of
our
are
either
warblers
vireos
flycatchers
thrushes
or
finches
the
warblers
are
perhaps
the
most
puzzling
these
are
the
true
sylvia
the
real
they
are
small
very
active
but
feeble
songsters
and
to
be
seen
must
be
sought
for
in
passing
through
the
woods
most
persons
have
a
vague
consciousness
of
slight
chirping
sounds
in
the
trees
overhead
in
most
cases
these
sounds
proceed
from
the
warblers
throughout
the
middle
and
eastern
states
half
a
dozen
species
or
so
may
be
found
in
almost
every
locality
as
the
redstart
the
maryland
the
yellow
warbler
not
the
common
goldfinch
with
black
cap
and
black
wings
and
tail
the
hooded
warbler
the
black
and
white
creeping
warbler
or
others
according
to
the
locality
and
the
character
of
the
woods
in
pine
or
hemlock
woods
one
species
may
predominate
in
maple
or
oak
woods
or
in
mountainous
districts
another
the
subdivisions
of
ground
warblers
the
most
common
members
of
which
are
the
maryland
the
kentucky
warbler
and
the
mourning
ground
warbler
are
usually
found
in
low
wet
bushy
or
woods
often
on
and
always
near
the
ground
the
summer
yellowbird
or
yellow
warbler
is
not
now
a
at
all
being
found
in
orchards
and
parks
and
along
streams
and
in
the
trees
of
villages
and
cities
as
we
go
north
the
number
of
warblers
increases
till
in
the
northern
part
of
new
england
and
in
the
canadas
as
many
as
ten
or
twelve
varieties
may
be
found
breeding
in
june
audubon
found
the
warbler
breeding
in
labrador
and
congratulates
himself
on
being
the
first
white
man
who
had
ever
seen
its
nest
when
these
warblers
pass
north
in
may
they
seem
to
go
singly
or
in
pairs
and
their
black
caps
and
striped
coats
show
conspicuously
when
they
return
in
september
they
are
in
troops
or
loose
flocks
are
of
a
uniform
dull
drab
or
brindlish
color
and
are
very
fat
they
scour
the
treetops
for
a
few
days
almost
eluding
the
eye
by
their
quick
movements
and
are
gone
according
to
my
own
observation
the
number
of
species
of
warblers
which
one
living
in
the
middle
districts
sees
on
their
return
in
the
fall
is
very
small
compared
with
the
number
he
may
observe
migrating
north
in
the
spring
the
warblers
are
the
most
noticeable
of
all
in
autumn
they
come
about
the
streets
and
garden
and
seem
especially
drawn
to
dry
leafless
trees
they
dart
spitefully
about
uttering
a
sharp
chirp
in
washington
i
have
seen
them
in
the
outskirts
all
winter
audubon
figures
and
describes
over
forty
different
warblers
more
recent
writers
have
divided
and
subdivided
the
group
very
much
giving
new
names
to
new
classifications
but
this
part
is
of
interest
and
value
only
to
the
professional
ornithologist
the
finest
songster
among
the
sylvia
according
to
my
notions
is
the
greenback
its
song
is
sweet
and
clear
but
brief
the
rarest
of
the
species
are
swainson
warbler
said
to
be
disappearing
the
cerulean
warbler
said
to
be
abundant
about
niagara
and
the
mourning
ground
warbler
which
i
have
found
breeding
about
the
of
the
delaware
in
new
york
the
vireos
or
greenlets
are
a
sort
of
connecting
link
between
the
warblers
and
the
true
flycatchers
and
partake
of
the
characteristics
of
both
the
vireo
whose
sweet
soliloquy
is
one
of
the
most
constant
and
cheerful
sounds
in
our
woods
and
groves
is
perhaps
the
most
noticeable
and
abundant
species
the
vireos
are
a
little
larger
than
the
warblers
and
are
far
less
brilliant
and
variegated
in
color
there
are
five
species
found
in
most
of
our
woods
namely
the
vireo
the
vireo
the
warbling
vireo
the
vireo
and
the
solitary
vireo
the
and
warbling
being
most
abundant
and
the
being
the
most
lively
and
animated
songster
i
meet
the
latter
bird
only
in
the
thick
bush
growths
of
low
swampy
localities
where
eluding
the
observer
it
pours
forth
its
song
with
a
sharpness
and
a
rapidity
of
articulation
that
are
truly
astonishing
this
strain
is
very
marked
and
though
inlaid
with
the
notes
of
several
other
birds
is
entirely
unique
the
iris
of
this
bird
is
white
as
that
of
the
is
red
though
in
neither
case
can
this
mark
be
distinguished
at
more
than
two
or
three
yards
in
most
cases
the
iris
of
birds
is
a
dark
hazel
which
passes
for
black
the
nest
pendent
to
the
low
branches
in
the
woods
which
the
falling
leaves
of
autumn
reveal
to
all
passers
is
in
most
cases
the
nest
of
the
though
the
solitary
constructs
a
similar
tenement
but
in
much
more
remote
and
secluded
localities
most
birds
exhibit
great
alarm
and
distress
usually
with
a
strong
dash
of
anger
when
you
approach
their
nests
but
the
demeanor
of
the
on
such
an
occasion
is
an
exception
to
this
rule
the
parent
birds
move
about
softly
amid
the
branches
above
eying
the
intruder
with
a
curious
innocent
look
uttering
now
and
then
a
subdued
note
or
plaint
solicitous
and
watchful
but
making
no
demonstration
of
anger
or
distress
the
birds
no
more
than
the
animals
like
to
be
caught
napping
but
i
remember
one
autumn
day
coming
upon
a
vireo
that
was
clearly
oblivious
to
all
that
was
passing
around
it
it
was
a
young
bird
though
full
grown
and
it
was
taking
its
siesta
on
a
low
branch
in
a
remote
heathery
field
its
head
was
snugly
stowed
away
under
its
wing
and
it
would
have
fallen
easy
prey
to
the
first
hawk
that
came
along
i
approached
noiselessly
and
when
within
a
few
feet
of
it
paused
to
note
its
breathings
so
much
more
rapid
and
full
than
our
own
a
bird
has
greater
lung
capacity
than
any
other
living
thing
hence
more
animal
heat
and
life
at
a
higher
pressure
when
i
reached
out
my
hand
and
carefully
closed
it
around
the
winged
sleeper
its
sudden
terror
and
consternation
almost
paralyzed
it
then
it
struggled
and
cried
piteously
and
when
released
hastened
and
hid
itself
in
some
near
bushes
i
never
expected
to
surprise
it
thus
a
second
time
the
flycatchers
are
a
larger
group
than
the
vireos
with
characteristics
they
are
not
properly
songsters
but
are
classed
by
some
writers
as
screechers
their
pugnacious
dispositions
are
well
known
and
they
not
only
fight
among
themselves
but
are
incessantly
quarreling
with
their
neighbors
the
kingbird
or
tyrant
flycatcher
might
serve
as
the
type
of
the
order
the
common
or
wood
pewee
excites
the
most
pleasant
emotions
both
on
account
of
its
plaintive
note
and
its
exquisite
mossy
nest
the
is
the
pioneer
of
the
flycatchers
and
comes
in
april
sometimes
in
march
its
comes
familiarly
about
the
house
and
outbuildings
and
usually
builds
beneath
or
under
bridges
the
flycatchers
always
take
their
insect
prey
on
the
wing
by
a
sudden
darting
or
swooping
movement
often
a
very
audible
snap
of
the
beak
may
be
heard
these
birds
are
the
least
elegant
both
in
form
and
color
of
any
of
our
feathered
neighbors
they
have
short
legs
a
short
neck
large
heads
and
broad
flat
beaks
with
bristles
at
the
base
they
often
fly
with
a
peculiar
quivering
movement
of
the
wings
and
when
at
rest
some
of
the
species
oscillate
their
tails
at
short
intervals
there
are
found
in
the
united
states
nineteen
species
in
the
middle
and
eastern
districts
one
may
observe
in
summer
without
any
special
search
about
five
of
them
namely
the
kingbird
the
the
wood
pewee
the
great
crested
flycatcher
distinguished
from
all
others
by
the
bright
ferruginous
color
of
its
tail
and
the
small
flycatcher
the
thrushes
are
the
birds
of
real
melody
and
will
afford
one
more
delight
perhaps
than
any
other
class
the
robin
is
the
most
familiar
example
their
manners
flight
and
form
are
the
same
in
each
species
see
the
robin
hop
along
upon
the
ground
strike
an
attitude
scratch
for
a
worm
fix
his
eye
upon
something
before
him
or
upon
the
beholder
flip
his
wings
suspiciously
fly
straight
to
his
perch
or
sit
at
sundown
on
some
high
branch
caroling
his
sweet
and
honest
strain
and
you
have
seen
what
is
characteristic
of
all
the
thrushes
their
carriage
is
preëminently
marked
by
grace
and
their
songs
by
melody
beside
the
robin
which
is
in
no
sense
a
woodbird
we
have
in
new
york
the
wood
thrush
the
hermit
thrush
the
veery
or
wilson
thrush
the
thrush
and
transiently
one
or
two
other
species
not
so
clearly
defined
the
wood
thrush
and
the
hermit
stand
at
the
head
as
songsters
no
two
persons
perhaps
agreeing
as
to
which
is
the
superior
under
the
general
head
of
finches
audubon
describes
over
sixty
different
birds
ranging
from
the
sparrows
to
the
grosbeaks
and
including
the
buntings
the
linnets
the
snowbirds
the
crossbills
and
the
redbirds
we
have
nearly
or
quite
a
dozen
varieties
of
the
sparrow
in
the
atlantic
states
but
perhaps
no
more
than
half
that
number
would
be
discriminated
by
the
unprofessional
observer
the
song
sparrow
which
every
child
knows
comes
first
at
least
his
voice
is
first
heard
and
can
there
be
anything
more
fresh
and
pleasing
than
this
first
simple
strain
heard
from
the
garden
fence
or
a
near
hedge
on
some
bright
still
march
morning
the
field
or
vesper
sparrow
called
also
grass
finch
and
sparrow
a
bird
slightly
larger
than
the
song
sparrow
and
of
a
lighter
gray
color
is
abundant
in
all
our
upland
fields
and
pastures
and
is
a
very
sweet
songster
it
builds
upon
the
ground
without
the
slightest
cover
or
protection
and
also
roosts
there
walking
through
the
fields
at
dusk
i
frequently
start
them
up
almost
beneath
my
feet
when
disturbed
by
day
they
fly
with
a
quick
sharp
movement
showing
two
white
quills
in
the
tail
the
traveler
along
the
country
roads
disturbs
them
earthing
their
wings
in
the
soft
dry
earth
or
sees
them
skulking
and
flitting
along
the
fences
in
front
of
him
they
run
in
the
furrow
in
advance
of
the
team
or
perch
upon
the
stones
a
few
rods
off
they
sing
much
after
sundown
hence
the
aptness
of
the
name
vesper
sparrow
which
a
recent
writer
wilson
flagg
has
bestowed
upon
them
in
the
meadows
and
low
wet
lands
the
savanna
sparrow
is
met
with
and
may
be
known
by
its
fine
song
in
the
swamp
the
swamp
sparrow
the
fox
sparrow
the
largest
and
handsomest
species
of
this
family
comes
to
us
in
the
fall
from
the
north
where
it
breeds
likewise
the
tree
or
canada
sparrow
and
the
and
sparrow
the
social
sparrow
alias
hairbird
alias
is
the
smallest
of
the
sparrows
and
i
believe
the
only
one
that
builds
in
trees
the
finches
as
a
class
all
have
short
conical
bills
with
tails
more
or
less
forked
the
purple
finch
heads
the
list
in
varied
musical
abilities
besides
the
groups
of
our
more
familiar
birds
which
i
have
thus
hastily
outlined
there
are
numerous
other
groups
more
limited
in
specimens
but
comprising
some
of
our
songsters
the
bobolink
for
instance
has
properly
no
congener
the
famous
mockingbird
of
the
southern
states
belongs
to
a
genus
which
has
but
two
other
representatives
in
the
atlantic
states
namely
the
catbird
and
the
or
ferruginous
thrush
the
wrens
are
a
large
and
interesting
family
and
as
songsters
are
noted
for
vivacity
and
volubility
the
more
common
species
are
the
house
wren
the
marsh
wren
the
great
carolina
wren
and
the
winter
wren
the
latter
perhaps
deriving
its
name
from
the
fact
that
it
breed
in
the
north
it
is
an
exquisite
songster
and
pours
forth
its
notes
so
rapidly
and
with
such
sylvan
sweetness
and
cadence
that
it
seems
to
go
off
like
a
musical
alarm
wilson
called
the
kinglets
wrens
but
they
have
little
to
justify
the
name
except
that
the
song
is
of
the
same
gushing
lyrical
character
as
that
referred
to
above
dr
brewer
was
entranced
with
the
song
of
one
of
these
tiny
minstrels
in
the
woods
of
new
brunswick
and
thought
he
had
found
the
author
of
the
strain
in
the
warbler
he
seems
loath
to
believe
that
a
bird
so
small
as
either
of
the
kinglets
could
possess
such
vocal
powers
it
may
indeed
have
been
the
winter
wren
but
from
my
own
observation
i
believe
the
kinglet
quite
capable
of
such
a
performance
but
i
must
leave
this
part
of
the
subject
and
hasten
on
as
to
works
on
ornithology
audubon
though
its
expense
puts
it
beyond
the
reach
of
the
mass
of
readers
is
by
far
the
most
full
and
accurate
his
drawings
surpass
all
others
in
accuracy
and
spirit
while
his
enthusiasm
and
devotion
to
the
work
he
had
undertaken
have
but
few
parallels
in
the
history
of
science
his
chapter
on
the
wild
goose
is
as
good
as
a
poem
one
readily
overlooks
his
style
which
is
often
verbose
and
affected
in
consideration
of
enthusiasm
so
genuine
and
purpose
so
single
there
has
never
been
a
keener
eye
than
audubon
though
there
have
been
more
discriminative
ears
nuttall
for
instance
is
far
more
happy
in
his
descriptions
of
the
songs
and
notes
of
birds
and
more
to
be
relied
upon
audubon
thinks
the
song
of
the
louisiana
equal
to
that
of
the
european
nightingale
and
as
he
had
heard
both
birds
one
would
think
was
prepared
to
judge
yet
he
has
no
doubt
overrated
the
one
and
underrated
the
other
the
song
of
the
is
very
brief
compared
with
the
philomel
and
its
quality
is
brightness
and
vivacity
while
that
of
the
latter
bird
if
the
books
are
to
be
credited
is
melody
and
harmony
again
he
says
the
song
of
the
blue
grosbeak
resembles
the
bobolink
which
it
does
about
as
much
as
the
two
birds
resemble
each
other
in
color
one
is
black
and
white
and
the
other
is
blue
the
song
of
the
he
says
consists
of
a
short
succession
of
simple
notes
beginning
with
emphasis
and
gradually
falling
the
truth
is
they
run
up
the
scale
instead
of
down
beginning
low
and
ending
in
a
shriek
yet
considering
the
extent
of
audubon
work
the
wonder
is
the
errors
are
so
few
i
can
at
this
moment
recall
but
one
observation
of
his
the
contrary
of
which
i
have
proved
to
be
true
in
his
account
of
the
bobolink
he
makes
a
point
of
the
fact
that
in
returning
south
in
the
fall
they
do
not
travel
by
night
as
they
do
when
moving
north
in
the
spring
in
washington
i
have
heard
their
calls
as
they
flew
over
at
night
for
four
successive
autumns
as
he
devoted
the
whole
of
a
long
life
to
the
subject
and
figured
and
described
over
four
hundred
species
one
feels
a
real
triumph
on
finding
in
our
common
woods
a
bird
not
described
in
his
work
i
have
seen
but
two
walking
in
the
woods
one
day
in
early
fall
in
the
vicinity
of
west
point
i
started
up
a
thrush
that
was
sitting
on
the
ground
it
alighted
on
a
branch
a
few
yards
off
and
looked
new
to
me
i
thought
i
had
never
before
seen
so
a
thrush
i
shot
it
and
saw
that
it
was
a
new
acquaintance
its
peculiarities
were
its
broad
square
tail
the
length
of
its
legs
which
were
three
and
three
quarters
inches
from
the
end
of
the
middle
toe
to
the
and
the
deep
uniform
of
the
upper
parts
and
the
gray
of
the
lower
it
proved
to
be
the
thrush
named
and
first
described
by
professor
baird
but
little
seems
to
be
known
concerning
it
except
that
it
breeds
in
the
far
north
even
on
the
shores
of
the
arctic
ocean
i
would
go
a
good
way
to
hear
its
song
the
present
season
i
met
with
a
pair
of
them
near
washington
as
mentioned
above
in
size
this
bird
approaches
the
wood
thrush
being
larger
than
either
the
hermit
or
the
veery
unlike
all
other
species
no
part
of
its
plumage
has
a
tawny
or
yellowish
tinge
the
other
specimen
was
the
northern
or
small
to
the
and
the
to
the
louisiana
or
wagtail
i
found
it
at
the
head
of
the
delaware
where
it
evidently
had
a
nest
it
usually
breeds
much
further
north
it
has
a
strong
clear
warble
which
at
once
suggests
the
song
of
its
congener
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
account
of
this
particular
species
in
the
books
though
it
seems
to
be
well
known
more
recent
writers
and
explorers
have
added
to
audubon
list
over
three
hundred
new
species
the
greater
number
of
which
belong
to
the
northern
and
western
parts
of
the
continent
audubon
observations
were
confined
mainly
to
the
atlantic
and
gulf
states
and
the
adjacent
islands
hence
the
western
or
pacific
birds
were
but
little
known
to
him
and
are
only
briefly
mentioned
in
his
works
it
is
by
the
way
a
little
remarkable
how
many
of
the
western
birds
seem
merely
duplicates
of
the
eastern
thus
the
varied
thrush
of
the
west
is
our
robin
a
little
differently
marked
and
the
woodpecker
is
our
or
colored
red
instead
of
yellow
there
is
also
a
western
chickadee
a
western
chewink
a
western
blue
jay
a
western
bluebird
a
western
song
sparrow
western
grouse
quail
etc
one
of
the
most
remarkable
birds
of
the
west
seems
to
be
a
species
of
skylark
met
with
on
the
plains
of
dakota
which
mounts
to
the
height
of
three
or
four
hundred
feet
and
showers
down
its
ecstatic
notes
it
is
evidently
akin
to
several
of
our
eastern
species
a
correspondent
writing
to
me
from
the
country
one
september
said
i
have
observed
recently
a
new
species
of
bird
here
they
alight
upon
the
buildings
and
fences
as
well
as
upon
the
ground
they
are
walkers
in
a
few
days
he
obtained
one
and
sent
me
the
skin
it
proved
to
be
what
i
had
anticipated
namely
the
american
pipit
or
titlark
a
slender
brown
bird
about
the
size
of
the
sparrow
which
passes
through
the
states
in
the
fall
and
spring
to
and
from
its
breeding
haunts
in
the
far
north
they
generally
appear
by
twos
and
threes
or
in
small
loose
flocks
searching
for
food
on
banks
and
plowed
ground
as
they
fly
up
they
show
two
or
three
white
quills
in
the
tail
like
the
vesper
sparrow
flying
over
they
utter
a
single
chirp
or
cry
every
few
rods
they
breed
in
the
bleak
rocks
of
labrador
it
is
reported
that
their
eggs
have
also
been
found
in
vermont
and
i
feel
quite
certain
that
i
saw
this
bird
in
the
adirondack
mountains
in
the
month
of
august
the
male
launches
into
the
air
and
gives
forth
a
brief
but
melodious
song
after
the
manner
of
all
larks
they
are
walkers
this
is
a
characteristic
of
but
few
of
our
by
far
the
greater
number
are
hoppers
note
the
track
of
the
common
snowbird
the
feet
are
not
placed
one
in
front
of
the
other
as
in
the
track
of
the
crow
or
partridge
but
side
and
side
the
sparrows
thrushes
warblers
woodpeckers
buntings
are
all
hoppers
on
the
other
hand
all
aquatic
or
birds
are
walkers
the
plovers
and
sandpipers
and
snips
run
rapidly
among
the
the
grouse
pigeons
quails
larks
and
various
blackbirds
walk
the
swallows
walk
also
whenever
they
use
their
feet
at
all
but
very
awkwardly
the
larks
walk
with
ease
and
grace
note
the
meadowlarks
strutting
about
all
day
in
the
meadows
besides
being
walkers
the
larks
or
birds
allied
to
the
larks
all
sing
upon
the
wing
usually
poised
or
circling
in
the
air
with
a
hovering
tremulous
flight
the
meadowlark
occasionally
does
this
in
the
early
part
of
the
season
at
such
times
its
note
or
whistle
becomes
a
rich
amorous
warble
the
bobolink
also
has
both
characteristics
and
notwithstanding
the
difference
of
form
and
build
is
very
suggestive
of
the
english
skylark
as
it
figures
in
the
books
and
is
no
doubt
fully
its
equal
as
a
songster
of
our
small
we
have
three
varieties
east
of
the
mississippi
closely
related
to
each
other
which
i
have
already
spoken
of
and
which
walk
and
sing
more
or
less
on
the
wing
namely
the
two
species
of
or
wagtails
and
the
or
the
latter
is
the
most
common
and
few
observers
of
the
birds
can
have
failed
to
notice
its
easy
gliding
walk
its
other
lark
trait
namely
singing
in
the
air
seems
not
to
have
been
observed
by
any
other
naturalist
yet
it
is
a
characteristic
and
may
be
verified
by
any
person
who
will
spend
a
half
hour
in
the
woods
where
this
bird
abounds
on
some
june
afternoon
or
evening
i
hear
it
very
frequently
after
sundown
when
the
ecstatic
singer
can
hardly
be
distinguished
against
the
sky
i
know
of
a
high
mountain
where
i
have
sat
late
in
the
afternoon
and
heard
them
as
often
as
one
every
minute
sometimes
the
bird
would
be
far
below
me
sometimes
near
at
hand
and
very
frequently
the
singer
would
be
hovering
a
hundred
feet
above
the
summit
he
would
start
from
the
trees
on
one
side
of
the
open
space
reach
his
climax
in
the
air
and
plunge
down
on
the
other
side
his
descent
after
the
song
is
finished
is
very
rapid
and
precisely
like
that
of
the
titlark
when
it
sweeps
down
from
its
course
to
alight
on
the
ground
i
first
verified
this
observation
some
years
ago
i
had
long
been
familiar
with
the
song
but
had
only
strongly
suspected
the
author
of
it
when
as
i
was
walking
in
the
woods
one
evening
just
as
the
leaves
were
putting
out
i
saw
one
of
these
birds
but
a
few
rods
from
me
i
was
saying
to
myself
half
audibly
come
now
show
off
if
it
is
in
you
i
have
come
to
the
woods
expressly
to
settle
this
point
when
it
began
to
ascend
by
short
hops
and
flights
through
the
branches
uttering
a
sharp
preliminary
chirp
i
followed
it
with
my
eye
saw
it
mount
into
the
air
and
circle
over
the
woods
and
saw
it
sweep
down
again
and
dive
through
the
trees
almost
to
the
very
perch
from
which
it
had
started
as
the
paramount
question
in
the
life
of
a
bird
is
the
question
of
food
perhaps
the
most
serious
troubles
our
feathered
neighbors
encounter
are
early
in
the
spring
after
the
supply
of
fat
with
which
nature
stores
every
corner
and
of
the
system
thereby
anticipating
the
scarcity
of
food
has
been
exhausted
and
the
sudden
and
severe
changes
in
the
weather
which
occur
at
this
season
make
unusual
demands
upon
their
vitality
no
doubt
many
of
the
earlier
birds
die
from
starvation
and
exposure
at
this
season
among
a
troop
of
canada
sparrows
which
i
came
upon
one
march
day
all
of
them
evidently
much
reduced
one
was
so
feeble
that
i
caught
it
in
my
hand
during
the
present
season
a
very
severe
cold
spell
the
first
week
in
march
drove
the
bluebirds
to
seek
shelter
about
the
houses
and
outbuildings
as
night
approached
and
the
winds
and
the
cold
increased
they
seemed
filled
with
apprehension
and
alarm
and
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
came
about
the
windows
and
the
doors
crept
beneath
the
blinds
clung
to
the
gutters
and
beneath
the
cornice
flitted
from
porch
to
porch
and
from
house
to
house
seeking
in
vain
from
some
safe
retreat
from
the
cold
the
street
pump
which
had
a
small
opening
just
over
the
handle
was
an
attraction
which
they
could
not
resist
and
yet
they
seemed
aware
of
the
insecurity
of
the
position
for
no
sooner
would
they
stow
themselves
away
into
the
interior
of
the
pump
to
the
number
of
six
or
eight
than
they
would
rush
out
again
as
if
apprehensive
of
some
approaching
danger
time
after
time
the
cavity
was
filled
and
refilled
with
blue
and
brown
intermingled
and
as
often
emptied
presently
they
tarried
longer
than
usual
when
i
made
a
sudden
sally
and
captured
three
that
found
a
warmer
and
safer
lodging
for
the
night
in
the
cellar
in
the
fall
birds
and
fowls
of
all
kinds
become
very
fat
the
squirrels
and
mice
lay
by
a
supply
of
food
in
their
dens
and
retreats
but
the
birds
to
a
considerable
extent
especially
our
winter
residents
carry
an
equivalent
in
their
own
systems
in
the
form
of
adipose
tissue
i
killed
a
hawk
one
december
and
on
removing
the
skin
found
the
body
completely
encased
in
a
coating
of
fat
one
quarter
of
an
inch
in
thickness
not
a
particle
of
muscle
was
visible
this
coating
not
only
serves
as
a
protection
against
the
cold
but
supplies
the
waste
of
the
system
when
food
is
scarce
or
fails
altogether
the
crows
at
this
season
are
in
the
same
condition
it
is
estimated
that
a
crow
needs
at
least
half
a
pound
of
meat
per
day
but
it
is
evident
that
for
weeks
and
months
during
the
winter
and
spring
they
must
subsist
on
a
mere
fraction
of
that
amount
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
crow
or
hawk
when
in
his
fall
condition
would
live
two
weeks
without
a
morsel
of
food
passing
his
beak
a
domestic
fowl
will
do
as
much
one
january
i
unwittingly
shut
a
hen
under
the
door
of
an
outbuilding
where
not
a
particle
of
food
could
be
obtained
and
where
she
was
entirely
unprotected
from
the
severe
cold
when
the
luckless
dominick
was
discovered
about
eighteen
days
afterward
she
was
brisk
and
lively
but
fearfully
pinched
up
and
as
light
as
a
bunch
of
feathers
the
slightest
wind
carried
her
before
it
but
by
judicious
feeding
she
was
soon
restored
the
circumstances
of
the
bluebirds
being
emboldened
by
the
cold
suggests
the
fact
that
the
fear
of
man
which
by
now
seems
like
an
instinct
in
the
birds
is
evidently
an
acquired
trait
and
foreign
to
them
in
a
state
of
primitive
nature
every
gunner
has
observed
to
his
chagrin
how
wild
the
pigeons
become
after
a
few
days
of
firing
among
them
and
to
his
delight
how
easy
it
is
to
approach
near
his
game
in
new
or
unfrequented
woods
professor
baird
footnote
then
at
the
head
of
the
smithsonian
institution
tells
me
that
a
correspondent
of
theirs
visited
a
small
island
in
the
pacific
ocean
situated
about
two
hundred
miles
off
cape
lucas
to
procure
specimens
the
island
was
but
a
few
miles
in
extent
and
had
probably
never
been
visited
half
a
dozen
times
by
human
beings
the
naturalist
found
the
birds
and
so
tame
that
it
was
but
a
waste
of
ammunition
to
shoot
them
fixing
a
noose
on
the
end
of
a
long
stick
he
captured
them
by
putting
it
over
their
necks
and
hauling
them
to
him
in
some
cases
not
even
this
contrivance
was
needed
a
species
of
mockingbird
in
particular
larger
than
ours
and
a
splendid
songster
made
itself
so
familiar
as
to
be
almost
a
nuisance
hopping
on
the
table
where
the
collector
was
writing
and
scattering
the
pens
and
paper
eighteen
species
were
found
twelve
of
them
peculiar
to
the
island
thoreau
relates
that
in
the
woods
of
maine
the
canada
jay
will
sometimes
make
its
meal
with
the
lumbermen
taking
the
food
out
of
their
hands
yet
notwithstanding
the
birds
have
come
to
look
upon
man
as
their
natural
enemy
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
civilization
is
on
the
whole
favorable
to
their
increase
and
perpetuity
especially
to
the
smaller
species
with
man
comes
flies
and
moths
and
insects
of
all
kinds
in
greater
abundance
new
plants
and
weeds
are
introduced
and
with
the
clearing
up
of
the
country
are
sowed
broadcast
over
the
land
the
larks
and
snow
buntings
that
come
to
us
from
the
north
subsist
almost
entirely
upon
the
seeds
of
grasses
and
plants
and
how
many
of
our
more
common
and
abundant
species
are
and
entire
strangers
to
deep
forests
in
europe
some
birds
have
become
almost
domesticated
like
the
house
sparrow
and
in
our
own
country
the
cliff
swallow
seems
to
have
entirely
abandoned
ledges
and
shelving
rocks
as
a
place
to
nest
for
the
eaves
and
projections
of
farm
and
other
outbuildings
after
one
has
made
the
acquaintance
of
most
of
the
there
remain
the
seashore
and
its
treasures
how
little
one
knows
of
the
aquatic
fowls
even
after
reading
carefully
the
best
authorities
was
recently
forced
home
to
my
mind
by
the
following
circumstance
i
was
spending
a
vacation
in
the
interior
of
new
york
when
one
day
a
stranger
alighted
before
the
house
and
with
a
cigar
box
in
his
hand
approached
me
as
i
sat
in
the
doorway
i
was
about
to
say
that
he
would
waste
his
time
in
recommending
his
cigars
to
me
as
i
never
smoked
when
he
said
that
hearing
i
knew
something
about
birds
he
had
brought
me
one
which
had
been
picked
up
a
few
hours
before
in
a
near
the
village
and
which
was
stranger
to
all
who
had
seen
it
as
he
began
to
undo
the
box
i
expected
to
see
some
of
our
own
rarer
birds
perhaps
the
grosbeak
or
bohemian
chatterer
imagine
then
how
i
was
taken
aback
when
i
beheld
instead
a
bird
quite
as
large
as
a
pigeon
with
a
forked
tail
glossy
black
above
and
beneath
its
feet
and
its
long
graceful
wings
at
a
glance
told
that
it
was
a
but
as
to
its
name
or
habitat
i
must
defer
my
answer
till
i
could
get
a
peep
into
audubon
or
some
collection
the
bird
had
fallen
down
exhausted
in
a
meadow
and
was
picked
up
just
as
the
life
was
leaving
its
body
the
place
must
have
been
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
sea
as
the
bird
flies
as
it
was
the
sooty
tern
which
inhabits
the
florida
keys
its
appearance
so
far
north
and
so
far
inland
may
be
considered
somewhat
remarkable
on
removing
the
skin
i
found
it
terribly
emaciated
it
had
no
doubt
starved
to
death
ruined
by
too
much
wing
another
icarus
its
great
power
of
flight
had
made
it
bold
and
venturesome
and
had
carried
it
so
far
out
of
its
range
that
it
starved
to
death
before
it
could
return
the
sooty
tern
is
sometimes
called
the
on
account
of
its
form
and
the
power
of
flight
it
will
fly
nearly
all
day

up

note
john
burroughs
used
some
characters
which
are
not
standard
to
our
writing
in
he
used
a
diaeresis
in
preeminent
and
accented
e
in
debris
and
denouement
these
have
been
replaced
with
plain
letters
updater
note
preeminent
debris
and
denouement
have
all
been
corrected
to
have
their
accented
letters
i
substituted
the
letters
oe
for
the
ligature
used
often
in
the
word
phoebe
simularly
the
e
in
the
golden
scientific
name
is
modernized
he
also
used
symbols
available
to
a
typesetter
which
are
unavailable
to
us
in
ascii
plain
vanilla
text
to
illustrate
bird
calls
and
notes
i
have
replaced
these
with
a
description
of
what
was
there
originally
finally
he
used
italics
throughout
the
book
that
i
was
unable
to
retain
because
of
the
ascii
format
the
two
uses
of
the
italics
were
to
denote
scientific
names
and
to
emphasize
i
have
done
nothing
to
note
where
the
italics
were
used
as
i
do
think
it
really
has
a
great
affect
on
reading
this
book
