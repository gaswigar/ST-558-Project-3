what
happened
in
the
mountains
if
i
speak
of
myself
in
this
story
it
is
because
i
have
been
deeply
involved
in
its
startling
events
events
doubtless
among
the
most
extraordinary
which
this
twentieth
century
will
witness
sometimes
i
even
ask
myself
if
all
this
has
really
happened
if
its
pictures
dwell
in
truth
in
my
memory
and
not
merely
in
my
imagination
in
my
position
as
head
inspector
in
the
federal
police
department
at
washington
urged
on
moreover
by
the
desire
which
has
always
been
very
strong
in
me
to
investigate
and
understand
everything
which
is
mysterious
i
naturally
became
much
interested
in
these
remarkable
occurrences
and
as
i
have
been
employed
by
the
government
in
various
important
affairs
and
secret
missions
since
i
was
a
mere
lad
it
also
happened
very
naturally
that
the
head
of
my
department
placed
in
my
charge
this
astonishing
investigation
wherein
i
found
myself
wrestling
with
so
many
impenetrable
mysteries
in
the
remarkable
passages
of
the
recital
it
is
important
that
you
should
believe
my
word
for
some
of
the
facts
i
can
bring
no
other
testimony
than
my
own
if
you
do
not
wish
to
believe
me
so
be
it
i
can
scarce
believe
it
all
myself
the
strange
occurrences
began
in
the
western
part
of
our
great
american
state
of
north
carolina
there
deep
amid
the
blueridge
mountains
rises
the
crest
called
the
great
eyrie
its
huge
rounded
form
is
distinctly
seen
from
the
little
town
of
morganton
on
the
catawba
river
and
still
more
clearly
as
one
approaches
the
mountains
by
way
of
the
village
of
pleasant
garden
why
the
name
of
great
eyrie
was
originally
given
this
mountain
by
the
people
of
the
surrounding
region
i
am
not
quite
sure
it
rises
rocky
and
grim
and
inaccessible
and
under
certain
atmospheric
conditions
has
a
peculiarly
blue
and
distant
effect
but
the
idea
one
would
naturally
get
from
the
name
is
of
a
refuge
for
birds
of
prey
eagles
condors
vultures
the
home
of
vast
numbers
of
the
feathered
tribes
wheeling
and
screaming
above
peaks
beyond
the
reach
of
man
now
the
great
eyrie
did
not
seem
particularly
attractive
to
birds
on
the
contrary
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
began
to
remark
that
on
some
days
when
birds
approached
its
summit
they
mounted
still
further
circled
high
above
the
crest
and
then
flew
swiftly
away
troubling
the
air
with
harsh
cries
why
then
the
name
great
eyrie
perhaps
the
mount
might
better
have
been
called
a
crater
for
in
the
center
of
those
steep
and
rounded
walls
there
might
well
be
a
huge
deep
basin
perhaps
there
might
even
lie
within
their
circuit
a
mountain
lake
such
as
exists
in
other
parts
of
the
appalachian
mountain
system
a
lagoon
fed
by
the
rain
and
the
winter
snows
in
brief
was
not
this
the
site
of
an
ancient
volcano
one
which
had
slept
through
ages
but
whose
inner
fires
might
yet
reawake
might
not
the
great
eyrie
reproduce
in
its
neighborhood
the
violence
of
mount
krakatoa
or
the
terrible
disaster
of
mont
pelee
if
there
were
indeed
a
central
lake
was
there
not
danger
that
its
waters
penetrating
the
strata
beneath
would
be
turned
to
steam
by
the
volcanic
fires
and
tear
their
way
forth
in
a
tremendous
explosion
deluging
the
fair
plains
of
carolina
with
an
eruption
such
as
that
of
in
martinique
indeed
with
regard
to
this
last
possibility
there
had
been
certain
symptoms
recently
observed
which
might
well
be
due
to
volcanic
action
smoke
had
floated
above
the
mountain
and
once
the
country
folk
passing
near
had
heard
subterranean
noises
unexplainable
rumblings
a
glow
in
the
sky
had
crowned
the
height
at
night
when
the
wind
blew
the
smoky
cloud
eastward
toward
pleasant
garden
a
few
cinders
and
ashes
drifted
down
from
it
and
finally
one
stormy
night
pale
flames
reflected
from
the
clouds
above
the
summit
cast
upon
the
district
below
a
sinister
warning
light
in
presence
of
these
strange
phenomena
it
is
not
astonishing
that
the
people
of
the
surrounding
district
became
seriously
disquieted
and
to
the
disquiet
was
joined
an
imperious
need
of
knowing
the
true
condition
of
the
mountain
the
carolina
newspapers
had
flaring
headlines
the
mystery
of
great
eyrie
they
asked
if
it
was
not
dangerous
to
dwell
in
such
a
region
their
articles
aroused
curiosity
and
fear
curiosity
among
those
who
being
in
no
danger
themselves
were
interested
in
the
disturbance
merely
as
a
strange
phenomenon
of
nature
fear
in
those
who
were
likely
to
be
the
victims
if
a
catastrophe
actually
occurred
those
more
immediately
threatened
were
the
citizens
of
morganton
and
even
more
the
good
folk
of
pleasant
garden
and
the
hamlets
and
farms
yet
closer
to
the
mountain
assuredly
it
was
regrettable
that
mountain
climbers
had
not
previously
attempted
to
ascend
to
the
summit
of
the
great
eyrie
the
cliffs
of
rock
which
surrounded
it
had
never
been
scaled
perhaps
they
might
offer
no
path
by
which
even
the
most
daring
climber
could
penetrate
to
the
interior
yet
if
a
volcanic
eruption
menaced
all
the
western
region
of
the
carolinas
then
a
complete
examination
of
the
mountain
was
become
absolutely
necessary
now
before
the
actual
ascent
of
the
crater
with
its
many
serious
difficulties
was
attempted
there
was
one
way
which
offered
an
opportunity
of
reconnoitering
the
interior
with
out
clambering
up
the
precipices
in
the
first
days
of
september
of
that
memorable
year
a
aeronaut
named
wilker
came
to
morganton
with
his
balloon
by
waiting
for
a
breeze
from
the
east
he
could
easily
rise
in
his
balloon
and
drift
over
the
great
eyrie
there
from
a
safe
height
above
he
could
search
with
a
powerful
glass
into
its
deeps
thus
he
would
know
if
the
mouth
of
a
volcano
really
opened
amid
the
mighty
rocks
this
was
the
principal
question
if
this
were
settled
it
would
be
known
if
the
surrounding
country
must
fear
an
eruption
at
some
period
more
or
less
distant
the
ascension
was
begun
according
to
the
programme
suggested
the
wind
was
fair
and
steady
the
sky
clear
the
morning
clouds
were
disappearing
under
the
vigorous
rays
of
the
sun
if
the
interior
of
the
great
eyrie
was
not
filled
with
smoke
the
aeronaut
would
be
able
to
search
with
his
glass
its
entire
extent
if
the
vapors
were
rising
he
no
doubt
could
detect
their
source
the
balloon
rose
at
once
to
a
height
of
fifteen
hundred
feet
and
there
rested
almost
motionless
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
evidently
the
east
wind
which
was
brisk
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
did
not
make
itself
felt
at
that
height
then
unlucky
chance
the
balloon
was
caught
in
an
adverse
current
and
began
to
drift
toward
the
east
its
distance
from
the
mountain
chain
rapidly
increased
despite
all
the
efforts
of
the
aeronaut
the
citizens
of
morganton
saw
the
balloon
disappear
on
the
wrong
horizon
later
they
learned
that
it
had
landed
in
the
neighborhood
of
raleigh
the
capital
of
north
carolina
this
attempt
having
failed
it
was
agreed
that
it
should
be
tried
again
under
better
conditions
indeed
fresh
rumblings
were
heard
from
the
mountain
accompanied
by
heavy
clouds
and
wavering
glimmerings
of
light
at
night
folk
began
to
realize
that
the
great
eyrie
was
a
serious
and
perhaps
imminent
source
of
danger
yes
the
entire
country
lay
under
the
threat
of
some
seismic
or
volcanic
disaster
during
the
first
days
of
april
of
that
year
these
more
or
less
vague
apprehensions
turned
to
actual
panic
the
newspapers
gave
prompt
echo
to
the
public
terror
the
entire
district
between
the
mountains
and
morganton
was
sure
that
an
eruption
was
at
hand
the
night
of
the
fourth
of
april
the
good
folk
of
pleasant
garden
were
awakened
by
a
sudden
uproar
they
thought
that
the
mountains
were
falling
upon
them
they
rushed
from
their
houses
ready
for
instant
flight
fearing
to
see
open
before
them
some
immense
abyss
engulfing
the
farms
and
villages
for
miles
around
the
night
was
very
dark
a
weight
of
heavy
clouds
pressed
down
upon
the
plain
even
had
it
been
day
the
crest
of
the
mountains
would
have
been
invisible
in
the
midst
of
this
impenetrable
obscurity
there
was
no
response
to
the
cries
which
arose
from
every
side
frightened
groups
of
men
women
and
children
groped
their
way
along
the
black
roads
in
wild
confusion
from
every
quarter
came
the
screaming
voices
it
is
an
earthquake
it
is
an
eruption
whence
comes
it
from
the
great
eyrie
into
morganton
sped
the
news
that
stones
lava
ashes
were
raining
down
upon
the
country
shrewd
citizens
of
the
town
however
observed
that
if
there
were
an
eruption
the
noise
would
have
continued
and
increased
the
flames
would
have
appeared
above
the
crater
or
at
least
their
lurid
reflections
would
have
penetrated
the
clouds
now
even
these
reflections
were
no
longer
seen
if
there
had
been
an
earthquake
the
terrified
people
saw
that
at
least
their
houses
had
not
crumbled
beneath
the
shock
it
was
possible
that
the
uproar
had
been
caused
by
an
avalanche
the
fall
of
some
mighty
rock
from
the
summit
of
the
mountains
an
hour
passed
without
other
incident
a
wind
from
the
west
sweeping
over
the
long
chain
of
the
blueridge
set
the
pines
and
hemlocks
wailing
on
the
higher
slopes
there
seemed
no
new
cause
for
panic
and
folk
began
to
return
to
their
houses
all
however
awaited
impatiently
the
return
of
day
then
suddenly
toward
three
in
the
morning
another
alarm
flames
leaped
up
above
the
rocky
wall
of
the
great
eyrie
reflected
from
the
clouds
they
illuminated
the
atmosphere
for
a
great
distance
a
crackling
as
if
of
many
burning
trees
was
heard
had
a
fire
spontaneously
broken
out
and
to
what
cause
was
it
due
lightning
could
not
have
started
the
conflagration
for
no
thunder
had
been
heard
true
there
was
plenty
of
material
for
fire
at
this
height
the
chain
of
the
blueridge
is
well
wooded
but
these
flames
were
too
sudden
for
any
ordinary
cause
an
eruption
an
eruption
the
cry
resounded
from
all
sides
an
eruption
the
great
eyrie
was
then
indeed
the
crater
of
a
volcano
buried
in
the
bowels
of
the
mountains
and
after
so
many
years
so
many
ages
even
had
it
reawakened
added
to
the
flames
was
a
rain
of
stones
and
ashes
about
to
follow
were
the
lavas
going
to
pour
down
torrents
of
molten
fire
destroying
everything
in
their
passage
annihilating
the
towns
the
villages
the
farms
all
this
beautiful
world
of
meadows
fields
and
forests
even
as
far
as
pleasant
garden
and
morganton
this
time
the
panic
was
overwhelming
nothing
could
stop
it
women
carrying
their
infants
crazed
with
terror
rushed
along
the
eastward
roads
men
deserting
their
homes
made
hurried
bundles
of
their
most
precious
belongings
and
set
free
their
livestock
cows
sheep
pigs
which
fled
in
all
directions
what
disorder
resulted
from
this
agglomeration
human
and
animal
under
darkest
night
amid
forests
threatened
by
the
fires
of
the
volcano
along
the
border
of
marshes
whose
waters
might
be
upheaved
and
overflow
with
the
earth
itself
threatening
to
disappear
from
under
the
feet
of
the
fugitives
would
they
be
in
time
to
save
themselves
if
a
cascade
of
glowing
lava
came
rolling
down
the
slope
of
the
mountain
across
their
route
nevertheless
some
of
the
chief
and
shrewder
farm
owners
were
not
swept
away
in
this
mad
flight
which
they
did
their
best
to
restrain
venturing
within
a
mile
of
the
mountain
they
saw
that
the
glare
of
the
flames
was
decreasing
in
truth
it
hardly
seemed
that
the
region
was
immediately
menaced
by
any
further
upheaval
no
stones
were
being
hurled
into
space
no
torrent
of
lava
was
visible
upon
the
slopes
no
rumblings
rose
from
the
ground
there
was
no
further
manifestation
of
any
seismic
disturbance
capable
of
overwhelming
the
land
at
length
the
flight
of
the
fugitives
ceased
at
a
distance
where
they
seemed
secure
from
all
danger
then
a
few
ventured
back
toward
the
mountain
some
farms
were
reoccupied
before
the
break
of
day
by
morning
the
crests
of
the
great
eyrie
showed
scarcely
the
least
remnant
of
its
cloud
of
smoke
the
fires
were
certainly
at
an
end
and
if
it
were
impossible
to
determine
their
cause
one
might
at
least
hope
that
they
would
not
break
out
again
it
appeared
possible
that
the
great
eyrie
had
not
really
been
the
theater
of
volcanic
phenomena
at
all
there
was
no
further
evidence
that
the
neighborhood
was
at
the
mercy
either
of
eruptions
or
of
earthquakes
yet
once
more
about
five
from
beneath
the
ridge
of
the
mountain
where
the
shadows
of
night
still
lingered
a
strange
noise
swept
across
the
air
a
sort
of
whirring
accompanied
by
the
beating
of
mighty
wings
and
had
it
been
a
clear
day
perhaps
the
farmers
would
have
seen
the
passage
of
a
mighty
bird
of
prey
some
monster
of
the
skies
which
having
risen
from
the
great
eyrie
sped
away
toward
the
east
chapter
i
reach
morganton
the
of
april
having
left
washington
the
night
before
i
arrived
at
raleigh
the
capital
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
two
days
before
the
head
of
the
federal
police
had
called
me
to
his
room
he
was
awaiting
me
with
some
impatience
john
strock
said
he
are
you
still
the
man
who
on
so
many
occasions
has
proven
to
me
both
his
devotion
and
his
ability
ward
i
answered
with
a
bow
i
can
not
promise
success
or
even
ability
but
as
to
devotion
i
assure
you
it
is
yours
i
do
not
doubt
it
responded
the
chief
and
i
will
ask
you
instead
this
more
exact
question
are
you
as
fond
of
riddles
as
ever
as
eager
to
penetrate
into
mysteries
as
i
have
known
you
before
i
am
mr
ward
good
strock
then
listen
ward
a
man
of
about
fifty
years
of
great
power
and
intellect
was
fully
master
of
the
important
position
he
filled
he
had
several
times
entrusted
to
me
difficult
missions
which
i
had
accomplished
successfully
and
which
had
won
me
his
confidence
for
several
months
past
however
he
had
found
no
occasion
for
my
services
therefore
i
awaited
with
impatience
what
he
had
to
say
i
did
not
doubt
that
his
questioning
implied
a
serious
and
important
task
for
me
doubtless
you
know
said
he
what
has
happened
down
in
the
blueridge
mountains
near
morganton
surely
ward
the
phenomena
reported
from
there
have
been
singular
enough
to
arouse
anyone
curiosity
they
are
singular
even
remarkable
strock
no
doubt
about
that
but
there
is
also
reason
to
ask
if
these
phenomena
about
the
great
eyrie
are
not
a
source
of
continued
danger
to
the
people
there
if
they
are
not
forerunners
of
some
disaster
as
terrible
as
it
is
mysterious
it
is
to
be
feared
sir
so
we
must
know
strock
what
is
inside
of
that
mountain
if
we
are
helpless
in
the
face
of
some
great
force
of
nature
people
must
be
warned
in
time
of
the
danger
which
threatens
them
it
is
clearly
the
duty
of
the
authorities
ward
responded
i
to
learn
what
is
going
on
within
there
true
strock
but
that
presents
great
difficulties
everyone
reports
that
it
is
impossible
to
scale
the
precipices
of
the
great
eyrie
and
reach
its
interior
but
has
anyone
ever
attempted
it
with
scientific
appliances
and
under
the
best
conditions
i
doubt
it
and
believe
a
resolute
attempt
may
bring
success
nothing
is
impossible
ward
what
we
face
here
is
merely
a
question
of
expense
we
must
not
regard
expense
when
we
are
seeking
to
reassure
an
entire
population
or
to
preserve
it
from
a
catastrophe
there
is
another
suggestion
i
would
make
to
you
perhaps
this
great
eyrie
is
not
so
inaccessible
as
is
supposed
perhaps
a
band
of
malefactors
have
secreted
themselves
there
gaining
access
by
ways
known
only
to
themselves
what
you
suspect
that
robbers
perhaps
i
am
wrong
strock
and
these
strange
sights
and
sounds
have
all
had
natural
causes
well
that
is
what
we
have
to
settle
and
as
quickly
as
possible
i
have
one
question
to
ask
go
ahead
strock
when
the
great
eyrie
has
been
visited
when
we
know
the
source
of
these
phenomena
if
there
really
is
a
crater
there
and
an
eruption
is
imminent
can
we
avert
it
no
strock
but
we
can
estimate
the
extent
of
the
danger
if
some
volcano
in
the
alleghanies
threatens
north
carolina
with
a
disaster
similar
to
that
of
martinique
buried
beneath
the
outpourings
of
mont
pelee
then
these
people
must
leave
their
homes
i
hope
sir
there
is
no
such
widespread
danger
i
think
not
strock
it
seems
to
me
highly
improbable
that
an
active
volcano
exists
in
the
blueridge
mountain
chain
our
appalachian
mountain
system
is
nowhere
volcanic
in
its
origin
but
all
these
events
can
not
be
without
basis
in
short
strock
we
have
decided
to
make
a
strict
inquiry
into
the
phenomena
of
the
great
eyrie
to
gather
all
the
testimony
to
question
the
people
of
the
towns
and
farms
to
do
this
i
have
made
choice
of
an
agent
in
whom
we
have
full
confidence
and
this
agent
is
you
strock
good
i
am
ready
ward
cried
i
and
be
sure
that
i
shall
neglect
nothing
to
bring
you
full
information
i
know
it
strock
and
i
will
add
that
i
regard
you
as
specially
fitted
for
the
work
you
will
have
a
splendid
opportunity
to
exercise
and
i
hope
to
satisfy
your
favorite
passion
of
curiosity
as
you
say
sir
you
will
be
free
to
act
according
to
circumstances
as
to
expenses
if
there
seems
reason
to
organize
an
ascension
party
which
will
be
costly
you
have
carte
blanche
i
will
act
as
seems
best
mr
ward
let
me
caution
you
to
act
with
all
possible
discretion
the
people
in
the
vicinity
are
already
it
will
be
well
to
move
secretly
do
not
mention
the
suspicions
i
have
suggested
to
you
and
above
all
avoid
arousing
any
fresh
panic
it
is
understood
you
will
be
accredited
to
the
mayor
of
morganton
who
will
assist
you
once
more
be
prudent
strock
and
acquaint
no
one
with
your
mission
unless
it
is
absolutely
necessary
you
have
often
given
proofs
of
your
intelligence
and
address
and
this
time
i
feel
assured
you
will
succeed
i
asked
him
only
when
shall
i
start
tomorrow
tomorrow
i
shall
leave
washington
and
the
day
after
i
shall
be
at
morganton
how
little
suspicion
had
i
of
what
the
future
had
in
store
for
me
i
returned
immediately
to
my
house
where
i
made
my
preparations
for
departure
and
the
next
evening
found
me
in
raleigh
there
i
passed
the
night
and
in
the
course
of
the
next
afternoon
arrived
at
the
railroad
station
of
morganton
morganton
is
but
a
small
town
built
upon
strata
of
the
jurassic
period
particularly
rich
in
coal
its
mines
give
it
some
prosperity
it
also
has
numerous
unpleasant
mineral
waters
so
that
the
season
there
attracts
many
visitors
around
morganton
is
a
rich
farming
country
with
broad
fields
of
grain
it
lies
in
the
midst
of
swamps
covered
with
mosses
and
reeds
evergreen
forests
rise
high
up
the
mountain
slopes
all
that
the
region
lacks
is
the
wells
of
natural
gas
that
invaluable
natural
source
of
power
light
and
warmth
so
abundant
in
most
of
the
alleghany
valleys
villages
and
farms
are
numerous
up
to
the
very
borders
of
the
mountain
forests
thus
there
were
many
thousands
of
people
threatened
if
the
great
eyrie
proved
indeed
a
volcano
if
the
convulsions
of
nature
extended
to
pleasant
garden
and
to
morganton
the
mayor
of
morganton
elias
smith
was
a
tall
man
vigorous
and
enterprising
forty
years
old
or
more
and
of
a
health
to
defy
all
the
doctors
of
the
two
americas
he
was
a
great
hunter
of
bears
and
panthers
beasts
which
may
still
be
found
in
the
wild
gorges
and
mighty
forests
of
the
alleghanies
smith
was
himself
a
rich
possessing
several
farms
in
the
neighborhood
even
his
most
distant
tenants
received
frequent
visits
from
him
indeed
whenever
his
official
duties
did
not
keep
him
in
his
home
at
morganton
he
was
exploring
the
surrounding
country
irresistibly
drawn
by
the
instincts
of
the
hunter
i
went
at
once
to
the
house
of
smith
he
was
expecting
me
having
been
warned
by
telegram
he
received
me
very
frankly
without
any
formality
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
a
glass
of
brandy
on
the
table
a
second
glass
was
brought
in
by
a
servant
and
i
had
to
drink
to
my
host
before
beginning
our
interview
ward
sent
you
said
he
to
me
in
a
jovial
tone
good
let
us
drink
to
ward
health
i
clinked
glasses
with
him
and
drank
in
honor
of
the
chief
of
police
and
now
demanded
elias
smith
what
is
worrying
him
at
this
i
made
known
to
the
mayor
of
morganton
the
cause
and
the
purpose
of
my
mission
in
north
carolina
i
assured
him
that
my
chief
had
given
me
full
power
and
would
render
me
every
assistance
financial
and
otherwise
to
solve
the
riddle
and
relieve
the
neighborhood
of
its
anxiety
relative
to
the
great
eyrie
elias
smith
listened
to
me
without
uttering
a
word
but
not
without
several
times
refilling
his
glass
and
mine
while
he
puffed
steadily
at
his
pipe
the
close
attention
which
he
gave
me
was
beyond
question
i
saw
his
cheeks
flush
at
times
and
his
eyes
gleam
under
their
bushy
brows
evidently
the
chief
magistrate
of
morganton
was
uneasy
about
great
eyrie
and
would
be
as
eager
as
i
to
discover
the
cause
of
these
phenomena
when
i
had
finished
my
communication
elias
smith
gazed
at
me
for
some
moments
in
silence
then
he
said
softly
so
at
washington
they
wish
to
know
what
the
great
eyrie
hides
within
its
circuit
yes
mr
smith
and
you
also
i
do
so
do
i
mr
strock
he
and
i
were
as
one
in
our
curiosity
you
will
understand
added
he
knocking
the
cinders
from
his
pipe
that
as
a
i
am
much
interested
in
these
stories
of
the
great
eyrie
and
as
mayor
i
wish
to
protect
my
constituents
a
double
reason
i
commented
to
stimulate
you
to
discover
the
cause
of
these
extraordinary
occurrences
without
doubt
my
dear
smith
they
have
appeared
to
you
as
inexplicable
and
as
threatening
as
to
your
people
inexplicable
certainly
strock
for
on
my
part
i
do
not
believe
it
possible
that
the
great
eyrie
can
be
a
volcano
the
alleghanies
are
nowhere
of
volcanic
origins
i
myself
in
our
immediate
district
have
never
found
any
geological
traces
of
scoria
or
lava
or
any
eruptive
rock
whatever
i
do
not
think
therefore
that
morganton
can
possibly
be
threatened
from
such
a
source
you
really
think
not
mr
smith
certainly
but
these
tremblings
of
the
earth
that
have
been
felt
in
the
neighborhood
yes
these
tremblings
these
tremblings
repeated
smith
shaking
his
head
but
in
the
first
place
is
it
certain
that
there
have
been
tremblings
at
the
moment
when
the
flames
showed
most
sharply
i
was
on
my
farm
of
wildon
less
than
a
mile
from
the
great
eyrie
there
was
certainly
a
tumult
in
the
air
but
i
felt
no
quivering
of
the
earth
but
in
the
reports
sent
to
ward
reports
made
under
the
impulse
of
the
panic
interrupted
the
mayor
of
morganton
i
said
nothing
of
any
earth
tremors
in
mine
but
as
to
the
flames
which
rose
clearly
above
the
crest
yes
as
to
those
strock
that
is
different
i
saw
them
saw
them
with
my
own
eyes
and
the
clouds
certainly
reflected
them
for
miles
around
moreover
noises
certainly
came
from
the
crater
of
the
great
eyrie
hissings
as
if
a
great
boiler
were
letting
off
steam
you
have
reliable
testimony
of
this
yes
the
evidence
of
my
own
ears
and
in
the
midst
of
this
noise
smith
did
you
believe
that
you
heard
that
most
remarkable
of
all
the
phenomena
a
sound
like
the
flapping
of
great
wings
i
thought
so
strock
but
what
mighty
bird
could
this
be
which
sped
away
after
the
flames
had
died
down
and
what
wings
could
ever
make
such
tremendous
sounds
i
therefore
seriously
question
if
this
must
not
have
been
a
deception
of
my
imagination
the
great
eyrie
a
refuge
for
unknown
monsters
of
the
sky
would
they
not
have
been
seen
long
since
soaring
above
their
immense
nest
of
stone
in
short
there
is
in
all
this
a
mystery
which
has
not
yet
been
solved
but
we
will
solve
it
smith
if
you
will
give
me
your
aid
surely
strock
tomorrow
we
will
start
our
campaign
tomorrow
and
on
that
word
the
mayor
and
i
separated
i
went
to
a
hotel
and
established
myself
for
a
stay
which
might
be
indefinitely
prolonged
then
having
dined
and
written
to
ward
i
saw
smith
again
in
the
afternoon
and
arranged
to
leave
morganton
with
him
at
daybreak
our
first
purpose
was
to
undertake
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
with
the
aid
of
two
experienced
guides
these
men
had
ascended
mt
mitchell
and
others
of
the
highest
peaks
of
the
blueridge
they
had
never
however
attempted
the
great
eyrie
knowing
that
its
walls
of
inaccessible
cliffs
defended
it
on
every
side
moreover
before
the
recent
startling
occurrences
the
great
eyrie
had
not
particularly
attracted
the
attention
of
tourists
smith
knew
the
two
guides
personally
as
men
daring
skillful
and
trustworthy
they
would
stop
at
no
obstacle
and
we
were
resolved
to
follow
them
through
everything
moreover
smith
remarked
at
the
last
that
perhaps
it
was
no
longer
as
difficult
as
formerly
to
penetrate
within
the
great
eyrie
and
why
asked
i
because
a
huge
block
has
recently
broken
away
from
the
mountain
side
and
perhaps
it
has
left
a
practicable
path
or
entrance
that
would
be
a
fortunate
chance
mr
smith
we
shall
know
all
about
it
strock
no
later
than
tomorrow
till
tomorrow
then
chapter
the
great
eyrie
the
next
day
at
dawn
elias
smith
and
i
left
morganton
by
a
road
which
winding
along
the
left
bank
of
the
catawba
river
led
to
the
village
of
pleasant
garden
the
guides
accompanied
us
harry
horn
a
man
of
thirty
and
james
bruck
aged
they
were
both
natives
of
the
region
and
in
constant
demand
among
the
tourists
who
climbed
the
peaks
of
the
blueridge
and
cumberland
mountains
a
light
wagon
with
two
good
horses
was
provided
to
carry
us
to
the
foot
of
the
range
it
contained
provisions
for
two
or
three
days
beyond
which
our
trip
surely
would
not
be
protracted
smith
had
shown
himself
a
generous
provider
both
in
meats
and
in
liquors
as
to
water
the
mountain
springs
would
furnish
it
in
abundance
increased
by
the
heavy
rains
frequent
in
that
region
during
springtime
it
is
needless
to
add
that
the
mayor
of
morganton
in
his
role
of
hunter
had
brought
along
his
gun
and
his
dog
nisko
who
gamboled
joyously
about
the
wagon
nisko
however
was
to
remain
behind
at
the
farm
at
wildon
when
we
attempted
our
ascent
he
could
not
possibly
follow
us
to
the
great
eyrie
with
its
cliffs
to
scale
and
its
crevasses
to
cross
the
day
was
beautiful
the
fresh
air
in
that
climate
is
still
cool
of
an
april
morning
a
few
fleecy
clouds
sped
rapidly
overhead
driven
by
a
light
breeze
which
swept
across
the
long
plains
from
the
distant
atlantic
the
sun
peeping
forth
at
intervals
illumined
all
the
fresh
young
verdure
of
the
countryside
an
entire
world
animated
the
woods
through
which
we
passed
from
before
our
equipage
fled
squirrels
parroquets
of
brilliant
colors
and
deafening
loquacity
opossums
passed
in
hurried
leaps
bearing
their
young
in
their
pouches
myriads
of
birds
were
scattered
amid
the
foliage
of
banyans
palms
and
masses
of
rhododendrons
so
luxuriant
that
their
thickets
were
impenetrable
we
arrived
that
evening
at
pleasant
garden
where
we
were
comfortably
located
for
the
night
with
the
mayor
of
the
town
a
particular
friend
of
smith
pleasant
garden
proved
little
more
than
a
village
but
its
mayor
gave
us
a
warm
and
generous
reception
and
we
supped
pleasantly
in
his
charming
home
which
stood
beneath
the
shades
of
some
giant
naturally
the
conversation
turned
upon
our
attempt
to
explore
the
interior
of
the
great
eyrie
you
are
right
said
our
host
until
we
all
know
what
is
hidden
within
there
our
people
will
remain
uneasy
has
nothing
new
occurred
i
asked
since
the
last
appearance
of
flames
above
the
great
eyrie
nothing
strock
from
pleasant
garden
we
can
see
the
entire
crest
of
the
mountain
not
a
suspicious
noise
has
come
down
to
us
not
a
spark
has
risen
if
a
legion
of
devils
is
in
hiding
there
they
must
have
finished
their
infernal
cookery
and
soared
away
to
some
other
haunt
devils
cried
smith
well
i
hope
they
have
not
decamped
without
leaving
some
traces
of
their
occupation
some
parings
of
hoofs
or
horns
or
tails
we
shall
find
them
out
on
the
morrow
the
of
april
we
started
again
at
dawn
by
the
end
of
this
second
day
we
expected
to
reach
the
farm
of
wildon
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
country
was
much
the
same
as
before
except
that
our
road
led
more
steeply
upward
woods
and
marshes
alternated
though
the
latter
grew
sparser
being
drained
by
the
sun
as
we
approached
the
higher
levels
the
country
was
also
less
populous
there
were
only
a
few
little
hamlets
almost
lost
beneath
the
beech
trees
a
few
lonely
farms
abundantly
watered
by
the
many
streams
that
rushed
downward
toward
the
catawba
river
the
smaller
birds
and
beasts
grew
yet
more
numerous
i
am
much
tempted
to
take
my
gun
said
smith
and
to
go
off
with
nisko
this
will
be
the
first
time
that
i
have
passed
here
without
trying
my
luck
with
the
partridges
and
hares
the
good
beasts
will
not
recognize
me
but
not
only
have
we
plenty
of
provisions
but
we
have
a
bigger
chase
on
hand
today
the
chase
of
a
mystery
and
let
us
hope
added
i
we
do
not
come
back
disappointed
hunters
in
the
afternoon
the
whole
chain
of
the
blueridge
stretched
before
us
at
a
distance
of
only
six
miles
the
mountain
crests
were
sharply
outlined
against
the
clear
sky
well
wooded
at
the
base
they
grew
more
bare
and
showed
only
stunted
evergreens
toward
the
summit
there
the
scraggly
trees
grotesquely
twisted
gave
to
the
rocky
heights
a
bleak
and
bizarre
appearance
here
and
there
the
ridge
rose
in
sharp
peaks
on
our
right
the
black
dome
nearly
seven
thousand
feet
high
reared
its
gigantic
head
sparkling
at
times
above
the
clouds
have
you
ever
climbed
that
dome
mr
smith
i
asked
no
answered
he
but
i
am
told
that
it
is
a
very
difficult
ascent
a
few
mountaineers
have
climbed
it
but
they
report
that
it
has
no
outlook
commanding
the
crater
of
the
great
eyrie
that
is
so
said
the
guide
harry
horn
i
have
tried
it
myself
perhaps
suggested
i
the
weather
was
unfavorable
on
the
contrary
strock
it
was
unusually
clear
but
the
wall
of
the
great
eyrie
on
that
side
rose
so
high
it
completely
hid
the
interior
forward
cried
smith
i
shall
not
be
sorry
to
set
foot
where
no
person
has
ever
stepped
or
even
looked
before
certainly
on
this
day
the
great
eyrie
looked
tranquil
enough
as
we
gazed
upon
it
there
rose
from
its
heights
neither
smoke
nor
flame
toward
five
our
expedition
halted
at
the
wildon
farm
where
the
tenants
warmly
welcomed
their
landlord
the
farmer
assured
us
that
nothing
notable
had
happened
about
the
great
eyrie
for
some
time
we
supped
at
a
common
table
with
all
the
people
of
the
farm
and
our
sleep
that
night
was
sound
and
wholly
untroubled
by
premonitions
of
the
future
on
the
morrow
before
break
of
day
we
set
out
for
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
the
height
of
the
great
eyrie
scarce
exceeds
five
thousand
feet
a
modest
altitude
often
surpassed
in
this
section
of
the
alleghanies
as
we
were
already
more
than
three
thousand
feet
above
sea
level
the
fatigue
of
the
ascent
could
not
be
great
a
few
hours
should
suffice
to
bring
us
to
the
crest
of
the
crater
of
course
difficulties
might
present
themselves
precipices
to
scale
clefts
and
breaks
in
the
ridge
might
necessitate
painful
and
even
dangerous
detours
this
was
the
unknown
the
spur
to
our
attempt
as
i
said
our
guides
knew
no
more
than
we
upon
this
point
what
made
me
anxious
was
of
course
the
common
report
that
the
great
eyrie
was
wholly
inaccessible
but
this
remained
unproven
and
then
there
was
the
new
chance
that
a
fallen
block
had
left
a
breach
in
the
rocky
wall
at
last
said
smith
to
me
after
lighting
the
first
pipe
of
the
twenty
or
more
which
he
smoked
each
day
we
are
well
started
as
to
whether
the
ascent
will
take
more
or
less
time
in
any
case
smith
interrupted
i
you
and
i
are
fully
resolved
to
pursue
our
quest
to
the
end
fully
resolved
mr
strock
my
chief
has
charged
me
to
snatch
the
secret
from
this
demon
of
the
great
eyrie
we
will
snatch
it
from
him
willing
or
unwilling
vowed
smith
calling
heaven
to
witness
even
if
we
have
to
search
the
very
bowels
of
the
mountain
as
it
may
happen
then
said
i
that
our
excursion
will
be
prolonged
beyond
today
it
will
be
well
to
look
to
our
provisions
be
easy
strock
our
guides
have
food
for
two
days
in
their
knapsacks
besides
what
we
carry
ourselves
moreover
though
i
left
my
brave
nisko
at
the
farm
i
have
my
gun
game
will
be
plentiful
in
the
woods
and
gorges
of
the
lower
part
of
the
mountain
and
perhaps
at
the
top
we
shall
find
a
fire
to
cook
it
already
lighted
already
lighted
mr
smith
and
why
not
strock
these
flames
these
superb
flames
which
have
so
terrified
our
country
folk
is
their
fire
absolutely
cold
is
no
spark
to
be
found
beneath
their
ashes
and
then
if
this
is
truly
a
crater
is
the
volcano
so
wholly
extinct
that
we
can
not
find
there
a
single
ember
bah
this
would
be
but
a
poor
volcano
if
it
enough
fire
even
to
cook
an
egg
or
roast
a
potato
come
i
repeat
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
at
that
point
of
the
investigation
i
had
i
confess
no
opinion
formed
i
had
my
orders
to
examine
the
great
eyrie
if
it
proved
harmless
i
would
announce
it
and
people
would
be
reassured
but
at
heart
i
must
admit
i
had
the
very
natural
desire
of
a
man
possessed
by
the
demon
of
curiosity
i
should
be
glad
both
for
my
own
sake
and
for
the
renown
which
would
attach
to
my
mission
if
the
great
eyrie
proved
the
center
of
the
most
remarkable
phenomena
of
which
i
would
discover
the
cause
our
ascent
began
in
this
order
the
two
guides
went
in
front
to
seek
out
the
most
practicable
paths
elias
smith
and
i
followed
more
leisurely
we
mounted
by
a
narrow
and
not
very
steep
gorge
amid
rocks
and
trees
a
tiny
stream
trickled
downward
under
our
feet
during
the
rainy
season
or
after
a
heavy
shower
the
water
doubtless
bounded
from
rock
to
rock
in
tumultuous
cascades
but
it
evidently
was
fed
only
by
the
rain
for
now
we
could
scarcely
trace
its
course
it
could
not
be
the
outlet
of
any
lake
within
the
great
eyrie
after
an
hour
of
climbing
the
slope
became
so
steep
that
we
had
to
turn
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
and
our
progress
was
much
delayed
soon
the
gorge
became
wholly
impracticable
its
sides
offered
no
sufficient
foothold
we
had
to
cling
by
branches
to
crawl
upon
our
knees
at
this
rate
the
top
would
not
be
reached
before
sundown
faith
cried
smith
stopping
for
breath
i
realize
why
the
climbers
of
the
great
eyrie
have
been
few
so
few
that
it
has
never
been
ascended
within
my
knowledge
the
fact
is
i
responded
that
it
would
be
much
toil
for
very
little
profit
and
if
we
had
not
special
reasons
to
persist
in
our
attempt
you
never
said
a
truer
word
declared
harry
horn
my
comrade
and
i
have
scaled
the
black
dome
several
times
but
we
never
met
such
obstacles
as
these
the
difficulties
seem
almost
impassable
added
james
bruck
the
question
now
was
to
determine
to
which
side
we
should
turn
for
a
new
route
to
right
as
to
left
arose
impenetrable
masses
of
trees
and
bushes
in
truth
even
the
scaling
of
cliffs
would
have
been
more
easy
perhaps
if
we
could
get
above
this
wooded
slope
we
could
advance
with
surer
foot
now
we
could
only
go
ahead
blindly
and
trust
to
the
instincts
of
our
two
guides
james
bruck
was
especially
useful
i
believe
that
that
gallant
lad
would
have
equaled
a
monkey
in
lightness
and
a
wild
goat
in
agility
unfortunately
neither
elias
smith
nor
i
was
able
to
climb
where
he
could
however
when
it
is
a
matter
of
real
need
with
me
i
trust
i
shall
never
be
backward
being
resolute
by
nature
and
in
bodily
exercise
where
james
bruck
went
i
was
determined
to
go
also
though
it
might
cost
me
some
uncomfortable
falls
but
it
was
not
the
same
with
the
first
magistrate
of
morganton
less
young
less
vigorous
larger
stouter
and
less
persistent
than
we
others
plainly
he
made
every
effort
not
to
retard
our
progress
but
he
panted
like
a
seal
and
soon
i
insisted
on
his
stopping
to
rest
in
short
it
was
evident
that
the
ascent
of
the
great
eyrie
would
require
far
more
time
than
we
had
estimated
we
had
expected
to
reach
the
foot
of
the
rocky
wall
before
eleven
but
we
now
saw
that
would
still
find
us
several
hundred
feet
below
it
toward
ten
after
repeated
attempts
to
discover
some
more
practicable
route
after
numberless
turnings
and
returnings
one
of
the
guides
gave
the
signal
to
halt
we
found
ourselves
at
last
on
the
upper
border
of
the
heavy
wood
the
trees
more
thinly
spaced
permitted
us
a
glimpse
upward
to
the
base
of
the
rocky
wall
which
constituted
the
true
great
eyrie
whew
exclaimed
smith
leaning
against
a
mighty
pine
tree
a
little
respite
a
little
repose
and
even
a
little
repast
would
not
go
badly
we
will
rest
an
hour
said
i
yes
after
working
our
lungs
and
our
legs
we
will
make
our
stomachs
work
we
were
all
agreed
on
this
point
a
rest
would
certainty
freshen
us
our
only
cause
for
inquietude
was
now
the
appearance
of
the
precipitous
slope
above
us
we
looked
up
toward
one
of
those
bare
strips
called
in
that
region
slides
amid
this
loose
earth
these
yielding
stones
and
these
abrupt
rocks
there
was
no
roadway
harry
horn
said
to
his
comrade
it
will
not
be
easy
perhaps
impossible
responded
bruck
their
comments
caused
me
secret
uneasiness
if
i
returned
without
even
having
scaled
the
mountain
my
mission
would
be
a
complete
failure
without
speaking
of
the
torture
to
my
curiosity
and
when
i
stood
again
before
ward
shamed
and
confused
i
should
cut
but
a
sorry
figure
we
opened
our
knapsacks
and
lunched
moderately
on
bread
and
cold
meat
our
repast
finished
in
less
than
half
an
hour
smith
sprang
up
eager
to
push
forward
once
more
james
bruck
took
the
lead
and
we
had
only
to
follow
him
as
best
we
could
we
advanced
slowly
our
guides
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
their
doubt
and
hesitation
soon
horn
left
us
and
went
far
ahead
to
spy
out
which
road
promised
most
chance
of
success
twenty
minutes
later
he
returned
and
led
us
onward
toward
the
northwest
it
was
on
this
side
that
the
black
dome
rose
at
a
distance
of
three
or
four
miles
our
path
was
still
difficult
and
painful
amid
the
sliding
stones
held
in
place
only
occasionally
by
wiry
bushes
at
length
after
a
weary
struggle
we
gained
some
two
hundred
feet
further
upward
and
found
ourselves
facing
a
great
gash
which
broke
the
earth
at
this
spot
here
and
there
were
scattered
roots
recently
uptorn
branches
broken
off
huge
stones
reduced
to
powder
as
if
an
avalanche
had
rushed
down
this
flank
of
the
mountain
that
must
be
the
path
taken
by
the
huge
block
which
broke
away
from
the
great
eyrie
commented
james
bruck
no
doubt
answered
smith
and
i
think
we
had
better
follow
the
road
that
it
has
made
for
us
it
was
indeed
this
gash
that
harry
horn
had
selected
for
our
ascent
our
feet
found
lodgment
in
the
firmer
earth
which
had
resisted
the
passage
of
the
monster
rock
our
task
thus
became
much
easier
and
our
progress
was
in
a
straight
line
upward
so
that
toward
half
past
eleven
we
reached
the
upper
border
of
the
slide
before
us
less
than
a
hundred
feet
away
but
towering
a
hundred
feet
straight
upwards
in
the
air
rose
the
rocky
wall
which
formed
the
final
crest
the
last
defence
of
the
great
eyrie
from
this
side
the
summit
of
the
wall
showed
capriciously
irregular
rising
in
rude
towers
and
jagged
needles
at
one
point
the
outline
appeared
to
be
an
enormous
eagle
silhouetted
against
the
sky
just
ready
to
take
flight
upon
this
side
at
least
the
precipice
was
insurmountable
rest
a
minute
said
smith
and
we
will
see
if
it
is
possible
to
make
our
way
around
the
base
of
this
cliff
at
any
rate
said
harry
horn
the
great
block
must
have
fallen
from
this
part
of
the
cliff
and
it
has
left
no
breach
for
entering
they
were
both
right
we
must
seek
entrance
elsewhere
after
a
rest
of
ten
minutes
we
clambered
up
close
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
began
to
make
a
circuit
of
its
base
assuredly
the
great
eyrie
now
took
on
to
my
eyes
an
aspect
absolutely
fantastic
its
heights
seemed
peopled
by
dragons
and
huge
monsters
if
chimeras
griffins
and
all
the
creations
of
mythology
had
appeared
to
guard
it
i
should
have
been
scarcely
surprised
with
great
difficulty
and
not
without
danger
we
continued
our
tour
of
this
circumvallation
where
it
seemed
that
nature
had
worked
as
man
does
with
careful
regularity
nowhere
was
there
any
break
in
the
fortification
nowhere
a
fault
in
the
strata
by
which
one
might
clamber
up
always
this
mighty
wall
a
hundred
feet
in
height
after
an
hour
and
a
half
of
this
laborious
circuit
we
regained
our
i
could
not
conceal
my
disappointment
and
smith
was
not
less
chagrined
than
i
a
thousand
devils
cried
he
we
know
no
better
than
before
what
is
inside
this
confounded
great
eyrie
nor
even
if
it
is
a
crater
volcano
or
not
said
i
there
are
no
suspicious
noises
now
neither
smoke
nor
flame
rises
above
it
nothing
whatever
threatens
an
eruption
this
was
true
a
profound
silence
reigned
around
us
and
a
perfectly
clear
sky
shone
overhead
we
tasted
the
perfect
calm
of
great
altitudes
it
was
worth
noting
that
the
circumference
of
the
huge
wall
was
about
twelve
or
fifteen
hundred
feet
as
to
the
space
enclosed
within
we
could
scarce
reckon
that
without
knowing
the
thickness
of
the
encompassing
wall
the
surroundings
were
absolutely
deserted
probably
not
a
living
creature
ever
mounted
to
this
height
except
the
few
birds
of
prey
which
soared
high
above
us
our
watches
showed
three
and
smith
cried
in
disgust
what
is
the
use
of
stopping
here
all
day
we
shall
learn
nothing
more
we
must
make
a
start
strock
if
we
want
to
get
back
to
pleasant
garden
i
made
no
answer
and
did
not
move
from
where
i
was
seated
so
he
called
again
come
strock
you
do
answer
in
truth
it
cut
me
deeply
to
abandon
our
effort
to
descend
the
slope
without
having
achieved
my
mission
i
felt
an
imperious
need
of
persisting
my
curiosity
had
redoubled
but
what
could
i
do
could
i
tear
open
this
unyielding
earth
overleap
the
mighty
cliff
throwing
one
last
defiant
glare
at
the
great
eyrie
i
followed
my
companions
the
return
was
effected
without
great
difficulty
we
had
only
to
slide
down
where
we
had
so
laboriously
scrambled
up
before
five
we
descended
the
last
slopes
of
the
mountain
and
the
farmer
of
wildon
welcomed
us
to
a
much
needed
meal
then
you
did
get
inside
said
he
no
responded
smith
and
i
believe
that
the
inside
exists
only
in
the
imagination
of
our
country
folk
at
half
past
eight
our
carriage
drew
up
before
the
house
of
the
mayor
of
pleasant
garden
where
we
passed
the
night
while
i
strove
vainly
to
sleep
i
asked
myself
if
i
should
not
stop
there
in
the
village
and
organize
a
new
ascent
but
what
better
chance
had
it
of
succeeding
than
the
first
the
wisest
course
was
doubtless
to
return
to
washington
and
consult
ward
so
the
next
day
having
rewarded
our
two
guides
i
took
leave
of
smith
at
morganton
and
that
same
evening
left
by
train
for
washington
chapter
a
meeting
of
the
automobile
club
was
the
mystery
of
the
great
eyrie
to
be
solved
some
day
by
chances
beyond
our
imagining
that
was
known
only
to
the
future
and
was
the
solution
a
matter
of
the
first
importance
that
was
beyond
doubt
since
the
safety
of
the
people
of
western
carolina
perhaps
depended
upon
it
yet
a
fortnight
after
my
return
to
washington
public
attention
was
wholly
distracted
from
this
problem
by
another
very
different
in
nature
but
equally
astonishing
toward
the
middle
of
that
month
of
may
the
newspapers
of
pennsylvania
informed
their
readers
of
some
strange
occurrences
in
different
parts
of
the
state
on
the
roads
which
radiated
from
philadelphia
the
chief
city
there
circulated
an
extraordinary
vehicle
of
which
no
one
could
describe
the
form
or
the
nature
or
even
the
size
so
rapidly
did
it
rush
past
it
was
an
automobile
all
were
agreed
on
that
but
as
to
what
motor
drove
it
only
imagination
could
say
and
when
the
popular
imagination
is
aroused
what
limit
is
there
to
its
hypotheses
at
that
period
the
most
improved
automobiles
whether
driven
by
steam
gasoline
or
electricity
could
not
accomplish
much
more
than
sixty
miles
an
hour
a
speed
that
the
railroads
with
their
most
rapid
expresses
scarce
exceed
on
the
best
lines
of
america
and
europe
now
this
new
automobile
which
was
astonishing
the
world
traveled
at
more
than
double
this
speed
it
is
needless
to
add
that
such
a
rate
constituted
an
extreme
danger
on
the
highroads
as
much
so
for
vehicles
as
for
pedestrians
this
rushing
mass
coming
like
a
preceded
by
a
formidable
rumbling
caused
a
whirlwind
which
tore
the
branches
from
the
trees
along
the
road
terrified
the
animals
browsing
in
adjoining
fields
and
scattered
and
killed
the
birds
which
could
not
resist
the
suction
of
the
tremendous
air
currents
engendered
by
its
passage
and
a
bizarre
detail
to
which
the
newspapers
drew
particular
attention
the
surface
of
the
roads
was
scarcely
even
scratched
by
the
wheels
of
the
apparition
which
left
behind
it
no
such
ruts
as
are
usually
made
by
heavy
vehicles
at
most
there
was
a
light
touch
a
mere
brushing
of
the
dust
it
was
only
the
tremendous
speed
which
raised
behind
the
vehicle
such
whirlwinds
of
dust
it
is
probable
commented
the
new
fork
herald
that
the
extreme
rapidity
of
motion
destroys
the
weight
naturally
there
were
protests
from
all
sides
it
was
impossible
to
permit
the
mad
speed
of
this
apparition
which
threatened
to
overthrow
and
destroy
everything
in
its
passage
equipages
and
people
but
how
could
it
be
stopped
no
one
knew
to
whom
the
vehicle
belonged
nor
whence
it
came
nor
whither
it
went
it
was
seen
but
for
an
instant
as
it
darted
forward
like
a
bullet
in
its
dizzy
flight
how
could
one
seize
a
in
the
air
as
it
leaped
from
the
mouth
of
the
gun
i
repeat
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
the
character
of
the
propelling
engine
it
left
behind
it
no
smoke
no
steam
no
odor
of
gasoline
or
any
other
oil
it
seemed
probable
therefore
that
the
vehicle
ran
by
electricity
and
that
its
accumulators
were
of
an
unknown
model
using
some
unknown
fluid
the
public
imagination
highly
excited
readily
accepted
every
sort
of
rumor
about
this
mysterious
automobile
it
was
said
to
be
a
supernatural
car
it
was
driven
by
a
specter
by
one
of
the
chauffeurs
of
hell
a
goblin
from
another
world
a
monster
escaped
from
some
mythological
menagerie
in
short
the
devil
in
person
who
could
defy
all
human
intervention
having
at
his
command
invisible
and
infinite
satanic
powers
but
even
satan
himself
had
no
right
to
run
at
such
speed
over
the
roads
of
the
united
states
without
a
special
permit
without
a
number
on
his
car
and
without
a
regular
license
and
it
was
certain
that
not
a
single
municipality
had
given
him
permission
to
go
two
hundred
miles
an
hour
public
security
demanded
that
some
means
be
found
to
unmask
the
secret
of
this
terrible
chauffeur
moreover
it
was
not
only
pennsylvania
that
served
as
the
theater
of
his
sportive
eccentricities
the
police
reported
his
appearance
in
other
states
in
kentucky
near
frankfort
in
ohio
near
columbus
in
tennessee
near
nashville
in
missouri
near
jefferson
and
finally
in
illinois
in
the
neighborhood
of
chicago
the
alarm
having
been
given
it
became
the
duty
of
the
authorities
to
take
steps
against
this
public
danger
to
arrest
or
even
to
halt
an
apparition
moving
at
such
speed
was
scarcely
practicable
a
better
way
would
be
to
erect
across
the
roads
solid
gateways
with
which
the
flying
machine
must
come
in
contact
sooner
or
later
and
be
smashed
into
a
thousand
pieces
nonsense
declared
the
incredulous
this
madman
would
know
well
how
to
circle
around
such
obstructions
and
if
necessary
added
others
the
machine
would
leap
over
the
barriers
and
if
he
is
indeed
the
devil
he
has
as
a
former
angel
presumably
preserved
his
wings
and
so
he
will
take
to
flight
but
this
last
was
but
the
suggestion
of
foolish
old
gossips
who
did
not
stop
to
study
the
matter
for
if
the
king
of
hades
possessed
a
pair
of
wings
why
did
he
obstinately
persist
in
running
around
on
the
earth
at
the
risk
of
crushing
his
own
subjects
when
he
might
more
easily
have
hurled
himself
through
space
as
free
as
a
bird
such
was
the
situation
when
in
the
last
week
of
may
a
fresh
event
occurred
which
seemed
to
show
that
the
united
states
was
indeed
helpless
in
the
hands
of
some
unapproachable
monster
and
after
the
new
world
would
not
the
old
in
its
turn
be
desecrated
by
the
mad
career
of
this
remarkable
automobilist
the
following
occurrence
was
reported
in
all
the
newspapers
of
the
union
and
with
what
comments
and
outcries
it
is
easy
to
imagine
a
race
was
to
be
held
by
the
automobile
club
of
wisconsin
over
the
roads
of
that
state
of
which
madison
is
the
capital
the
route
laid
out
formed
an
excellent
track
about
two
hundred
miles
in
length
starting
from
on
the
western
frontier
passing
by
madison
and
ending
a
little
above
milwaukee
on
the
borders
of
lake
michigan
except
for
the
japanese
road
between
nikko
and
namode
bordered
by
giant
cypresses
there
is
no
better
track
in
the
world
than
this
of
wisconsin
it
runs
straight
and
level
as
an
arrow
for
sometimes
fifty
miles
at
a
stretch
many
and
noted
were
the
machines
entered
for
this
great
race
every
kind
of
motor
vehicle
was
permitted
to
compete
even
motorcycles
as
well
as
automobiles
the
machines
were
of
all
makes
and
nationalities
the
sum
of
the
different
prizes
reached
fifty
thousand
dollars
so
that
the
race
was
sure
to
be
desperately
contested
new
records
were
expected
to
be
made
calculating
on
the
maximum
speed
hitherto
attained
of
perhaps
eighty
miles
an
hour
this
international
contest
covering
two
hundred
miles
would
last
about
three
hours
and
to
avoid
all
danger
the
state
authorities
of
wisconsin
had
forbidden
all
other
traffic
between
and
milwaukee
during
three
hours
on
the
morning
of
the
thirtieth
of
may
thus
if
there
were
any
accidents
those
who
suffered
would
be
themselves
to
blame
there
was
an
enormous
crowd
and
it
was
not
composed
only
of
the
people
of
wisconsin
many
thousands
gathered
from
the
neighboring
states
of
illinois
michigan
iowa
indiana
and
even
from
new
york
among
the
sportsmen
assembled
were
many
foreigners
english
french
germans
and
austrians
each
nationality
of
course
supporting
the
chauffeurs
of
its
land
moreover
as
this
was
the
united
states
the
country
of
the
greatest
gamblers
of
the
world
bets
were
made
of
every
sort
and
of
enormous
amounts
the
start
was
to
be
made
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
to
avoid
crowding
and
the
accidents
which
must
result
from
it
the
automobiles
were
to
follow
each
other
at
two
minute
intervals
along
the
roads
whose
borders
were
black
with
spectators
the
first
ten
racers
numbered
by
lot
were
dispatched
between
eight
and
twenty
minutes
past
unless
there
was
some
disastrous
accident
some
of
these
machines
would
surely
arrive
at
the
goal
by
eleven
the
others
followed
in
order
an
hour
and
a
half
had
passed
there
remained
but
a
single
contestant
at
word
was
sent
back
and
forth
by
telephone
every
five
minutes
as
to
the
order
of
the
racers
midway
between
madison
and
milwaukee
the
lead
was
held
by
a
machine
of
renault
brothers
four
cylindered
of
twenty
horsepower
and
with
michelin
tires
it
was
closely
followed
by
a
car
and
by
a
some
accidents
had
already
occurred
other
machines
were
hopelessly
behind
not
more
than
a
dozen
would
contest
the
finish
several
chauffeurs
had
been
injured
but
not
seriously
and
even
had
they
been
killed
the
death
of
men
is
but
a
detail
not
considered
of
great
importance
in
that
astonishing
country
of
america
naturally
the
excitement
became
more
intense
as
one
approached
the
finishing
line
near
milwaukee
there
were
assembled
the
most
curious
the
most
interested
and
there
the
passions
of
the
moment
were
unchained
by
ten
it
was
evident
that
the
first
prize
twenty
thousand
dollars
lay
between
five
machines
two
american
two
french
and
one
english
imagine
therefore
the
fury
with
which
bets
were
being
made
under
the
influence
of
national
pride
the
regular
book
makers
could
scarcely
meet
the
demands
of
those
who
wished
to
wager
offers
and
amounts
were
hurled
from
lip
to
lip
with
feverish
rapidity
one
to
three
on
the
one
to
two
on
the
even
money
on
the
renault
these
cries
rang
along
the
line
of
spectators
at
each
new
announcement
from
the
telephones
suddenly
at
nine
by
the
town
clock
of
two
miles
beyond
that
town
was
heard
a
tremendous
noise
and
rumbling
which
proceeded
from
the
midst
of
a
flying
cloud
of
dust
accompanied
by
shrieks
like
those
of
a
naval
siren
scarcely
had
the
crowds
time
to
draw
to
one
side
to
escape
a
destruction
which
would
have
included
hundreds
of
victims
the
cloud
swept
by
like
a
hurricane
no
one
could
distinguish
what
it
was
that
passed
with
such
speed
there
was
no
exaggeration
in
saying
that
its
rate
was
at
least
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
an
hour
the
apparition
passed
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
leaving
behind
it
a
long
train
of
white
dust
as
an
express
locomotive
leaves
behind
a
train
of
smoke
evidently
it
was
an
automobile
with
a
most
extraordinary
motor
if
it
maintained
this
speed
it
would
reach
the
contestants
in
the
of
the
race
it
would
pass
them
with
this
speed
double
their
own
it
would
arrive
first
at
the
goal
and
then
from
all
parts
arose
an
uproar
as
soon
as
the
spectators
had
nothing
more
to
fear
it
is
that
infernal
machine
yes
the
one
the
police
can
not
stop
but
it
has
not
been
heard
of
for
a
fortnight
it
was
supposed
to
be
done
for
destroyed
gone
forever
it
is
a
devil
car
driven
by
hellfire
and
with
satan
driving
in
truth
if
he
were
not
the
devil
who
could
this
mysterious
chauffeur
be
driving
with
this
unbelievable
velocity
his
no
less
mysterious
machine
at
least
it
was
beyond
doubt
that
this
was
the
same
machine
which
had
already
attracted
so
much
attention
if
the
police
believed
that
they
had
frightened
it
away
that
it
was
never
to
be
heard
of
more
well
the
police
were
mistaken
which
happens
in
america
as
elsewhere
the
first
stunned
moment
of
surprise
having
passed
many
people
rushed
to
the
telephones
to
warn
those
further
along
the
route
of
the
danger
which
menaced
not
only
the
people
but
also
the
automobiles
scattered
along
the
road
when
this
terrible
madman
arrived
like
an
avalanche
they
would
be
smashed
to
pieces
ground
into
powder
annihilated
and
from
the
collision
might
not
the
destroyer
himself
emerge
safe
and
sound
he
must
be
so
adroit
this
chauffeur
of
chauffeurs
he
must
handle
his
machine
with
such
perfection
of
eye
and
hand
that
he
knew
no
doubt
how
to
escape
from
every
situation
fortunately
the
wisconsin
authorities
had
taken
such
precautions
that
the
road
would
be
clear
except
for
contesting
automobiles
but
what
right
had
this
machine
among
them
and
what
said
the
racers
themselves
who
warned
by
telephone
had
to
sheer
aside
from
the
road
in
their
struggle
for
the
grand
prize
by
their
estimate
this
amazing
vehicle
was
going
at
least
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
an
hour
fast
as
was
their
speed
it
shot
by
them
at
such
a
rate
that
they
could
hardly
make
out
even
the
shape
of
the
machine
a
sort
of
lengthened
spindle
probably
not
over
thirty
feet
long
its
wheels
spun
with
such
velocity
that
they
could
scarce
be
seen
for
the
rest
the
machine
left
behind
it
neither
smoke
nor
scent
as
for
the
driver
hidden
in
the
interior
of
his
machine
he
had
been
quite
invisible
he
remained
as
unknown
as
when
he
had
first
appeared
on
the
various
roads
throughout
the
country
milwaukee
was
promptly
warned
of
the
coming
of
this
interloper
fancy
the
excitement
the
news
caused
the
immediate
purpose
agreed
upon
was
to
stop
this
projectile
to
erect
across
its
route
an
obstacle
against
which
it
would
smash
into
a
thousand
pieces
but
was
there
time
would
not
the
machine
appear
at
any
moment
and
what
need
was
there
since
the
track
ended
on
the
edge
of
lake
michigan
and
so
the
vehicle
would
be
forced
to
stop
there
anyway
unless
its
supernatural
driver
could
ride
the
water
as
well
as
the
land
here
also
as
all
along
the
route
the
most
extravagant
suggestions
were
offered
even
those
who
would
not
admit
that
the
mysterious
chauffeur
must
be
satan
in
person
allowed
that
he
might
be
some
monster
escaped
from
the
fantastic
visions
of
the
apocalypse
and
now
there
were
no
longer
minutes
to
wait
any
second
might
bring
the
expected
apparition
it
was
not
yet
eleven
when
a
rumbling
was
heard
far
down
the
track
and
the
dust
rose
in
violent
whirlwinds
harsh
whistlings
shrieked
through
the
air
warning
all
to
give
passage
to
the
monster
it
did
not
slacken
speed
at
the
finish
lake
michigan
was
not
half
a
mile
beyond
and
the
machine
must
certainly
be
hurled
into
the
water
could
it
be
that
the
mechanician
was
no
longer
master
of
his
mechanism
there
could
be
little
doubt
of
it
like
a
shooting
star
the
vehicle
flashed
through
milwaukee
when
it
had
passed
the
city
would
it
plunge
itself
to
destruction
in
the
waters
of
lake
michigan
at
any
rate
when
it
disappeared
at
a
slight
bend
in
the
road
no
trace
was
to
be
found
of
its
passage
chapter
along
the
shores
of
new
england
at
the
time
when
the
newspapers
were
filled
with
these
reports
i
was
again
in
washington
on
my
return
i
had
presented
myself
at
my
chief
office
but
had
been
unable
to
see
him
family
affairs
had
suddenly
called
him
away
to
be
absent
some
weeks
ward
however
undoubtedly
knew
of
the
failure
of
my
mission
the
newspapers
especially
those
of
north
carolina
had
given
full
details
of
our
ascent
of
the
great
eyrie
naturally
i
was
much
annoyed
by
this
delay
which
further
fretted
my
restless
curiosity
i
could
turn
to
no
other
plans
for
the
future
could
i
give
up
the
hope
of
learning
the
secret
of
the
great
eyrie
no
i
would
return
to
the
attack
a
dozen
times
if
necessary
and
despite
every
failure
surely
the
winning
of
access
within
those
walls
was
not
a
task
beyond
human
power
a
scaffolding
might
be
raised
to
the
summit
of
the
cliff
or
a
tunnel
might
be
pierced
through
its
depth
our
engineers
met
problems
more
difficult
every
day
but
in
this
case
it
was
necessary
to
consider
the
expense
which
might
easily
grow
out
of
proportion
to
the
advantages
to
be
gained
a
tunnel
would
cost
many
thousand
dollars
and
what
good
would
it
accomplish
beyond
satisfying
the
public
curiosity
and
my
own
my
personal
resources
were
wholly
insufficient
for
the
achievement
ward
who
held
the
government
funds
was
away
i
even
thought
of
trying
to
interest
some
millionaire
oh
if
i
could
but
have
promised
one
of
them
some
gold
or
silver
mines
within
the
mountain
but
such
an
hypothesis
was
not
admissible
the
chain
of
the
appalachians
is
not
situated
in
a
gold
bearing
region
like
that
of
the
pacific
mountains
the
transvaal
or
australia
it
was
not
until
the
fifteenth
of
june
that
ward
returned
to
duty
despite
my
lack
of
success
he
received
me
warmly
here
is
our
poor
strock
cried
he
at
my
entrance
our
poor
strock
who
has
failed
no
more
ward
than
if
you
had
charged
me
to
investigate
the
surface
of
the
moon
answered
i
we
found
ourselves
face
to
face
with
purely
natural
obstacles
insurmountable
with
the
forces
then
at
our
command
i
do
not
doubt
that
strock
i
do
not
doubt
that
in
the
least
nevertheless
the
fact
remains
that
you
have
discovered
nothing
of
what
is
going
on
within
the
great
eyrie
nothing
mr
ward
you
saw
no
sign
of
fire
none
and
you
heard
no
suspicious
noises
whatever
none
then
it
is
still
uncertain
if
there
is
really
a
volcano
there
still
uncertain
ward
but
if
it
is
there
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
it
has
sunk
into
a
profound
sleep
still
returned
ward
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
it
will
not
wake
up
again
any
day
strock
it
is
not
enough
that
a
volcano
should
sleep
it
must
be
absolutely
extinguished
unless
indeed
all
these
threatening
rumors
have
been
born
solely
in
the
carolinian
imagination
that
is
not
possible
sir
i
said
both
smith
the
mayor
of
morganton
and
his
friend
the
mayor
of
pleasant
garden
are
reliable
men
and
they
speak
from
their
own
knowledge
in
this
matter
flames
have
certainly
risen
above
the
great
eyrie
strange
noises
have
issued
from
it
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
of
the
reality
of
these
phenomena
granted
declared
ward
i
admit
that
the
evidence
is
unassailable
so
the
deduction
to
be
drawn
is
that
the
great
eyrie
has
not
yet
given
up
its
secret
if
we
are
determined
to
know
it
ward
the
solution
is
only
a
solution
of
expense
pickaxes
and
dynamite
would
soon
conquer
those
walls
no
doubt
responded
the
chief
but
such
an
undertaking
hardly
seems
justified
since
the
mountain
is
now
quiet
we
will
wait
awhile
and
perhaps
nature
herself
will
disclose
her
mystery
ward
believe
me
that
i
regret
deeply
that
i
have
been
unable
to
solve
the
problem
you
entrusted
to
me
i
said
nonsense
do
not
upset
yourself
strock
take
your
defeat
philosophically
we
can
not
always
be
successful
even
in
the
police
how
many
criminals
escape
us
i
believe
we
should
never
capture
one
of
them
if
they
were
a
little
more
intelligent
and
less
imprudent
and
if
they
did
not
compromise
themselves
so
stupidly
nothing
it
seems
to
me
would
be
easier
than
to
plan
a
crime
a
theft
or
an
assassination
and
to
execute
it
without
arousing
any
suspicions
or
leaving
any
traces
to
be
followed
you
understand
strock
i
do
not
want
to
give
our
criminals
lessons
i
much
prefer
to
have
them
remain
as
they
are
nevertheless
there
are
many
whom
the
police
will
never
be
able
to
track
down
on
this
matter
i
shared
absolutely
the
opinion
of
my
chief
it
is
among
rascals
that
one
finds
the
most
fools
for
this
very
reason
i
had
been
much
surprised
that
none
of
the
authorities
had
been
able
to
throw
any
light
upon
the
recent
performances
of
the
demon
automobile
and
when
ward
brought
up
this
subject
i
did
not
conceal
from
him
my
astonishment
he
pointed
out
that
the
vehicle
was
practically
unpursuable
that
in
its
earlier
appearances
it
had
apparently
vanished
from
all
roads
even
before
a
telephone
message
could
be
sent
ahead
active
and
numerous
police
agents
had
been
spread
throughout
the
country
but
no
one
of
them
had
encountered
the
delinquent
he
did
not
move
continuously
from
place
to
place
even
at
his
amazing
speed
but
seemed
to
appear
only
for
a
moment
and
then
to
vanish
into
thin
air
true
he
had
at
length
remained
visible
along
the
entire
route
from
to
milwaukee
and
he
had
covered
in
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
this
track
of
two
hundred
miles
but
since
then
there
had
been
no
news
whatever
of
the
machine
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
route
driven
onward
by
its
own
impetus
unable
to
stop
had
it
indeed
been
engulfed
within
the
waters
of
lake
michigan
must
we
conclude
that
the
machine
and
its
driver
had
both
perished
that
there
was
no
longer
any
danger
to
be
feared
from
either
the
great
majority
of
the
public
refused
to
accept
this
conclusion
they
fully
expected
the
machine
to
reappear
ward
frankly
admitted
that
the
whole
matter
seemed
to
him
most
extraordinary
and
i
shared
his
view
assuredly
if
this
infernal
chauffeur
did
not
return
his
apparition
would
have
to
be
placed
among
those
superhuman
mysteries
which
it
is
not
given
to
man
to
understand
we
had
fully
discussed
this
affair
the
chief
and
i
and
i
thought
that
our
interview
was
at
an
end
when
after
pacing
the
room
for
a
few
moments
he
said
abruptly
yes
what
happened
there
at
milwaukee
was
very
strange
but
here
is
something
no
less
so
with
this
he
handed
me
a
report
which
he
had
received
from
boston
on
a
subject
of
which
the
evening
papers
had
just
begun
to
apprise
their
readers
while
i
read
it
ward
was
summoned
from
the
room
i
seated
myself
by
the
window
and
studied
with
extreme
attention
the
matter
of
the
report
for
some
days
the
waters
along
the
coast
of
maine
connecticut
and
massachusetts
had
been
the
scene
of
an
appearance
which
no
one
could
exactly
describe
a
moving
body
would
appear
amid
the
waters
some
two
or
three
miles
off
shore
and
go
through
rapid
evolutions
it
would
flash
for
a
while
back
and
forth
among
the
waves
and
then
dart
out
of
sight
the
body
moved
with
such
lightning
speed
that
the
best
telescopes
could
hardly
follow
it
its
length
did
not
seem
to
exceed
thirty
feet
its
form
and
greenish
color
made
it
difficult
to
distinguish
against
the
background
of
the
ocean
it
had
been
most
frequently
observed
along
the
coast
between
cape
cod
and
nova
scotia
from
providence
from
boston
from
portsmouth
and
from
portland
motor
boats
and
steam
launches
had
repeatedly
attempted
to
approach
this
moving
body
and
even
to
give
it
chase
they
could
not
get
anywhere
near
it
pursuit
seemed
useless
it
darted
like
an
arrow
beyond
the
range
of
view
naturally
widely
differing
opinions
were
held
as
to
the
nature
of
this
object
but
no
hypothesis
rested
on
any
secure
basis
seamen
were
as
much
at
a
loss
as
others
at
first
sailors
thought
it
must
be
some
great
fish
like
a
whale
but
it
is
well
known
that
all
these
animals
come
to
the
surface
with
a
certain
regularity
to
breathe
and
spout
up
columns
of
mingled
air
and
water
now
this
strange
animal
if
it
was
an
animal
had
never
blown
as
the
whalers
say
nor
had
it
ever
made
any
noises
of
breathing
yet
if
it
were
not
one
of
these
huge
marine
mammals
how
was
this
unknown
monster
to
be
classed
did
it
belong
among
the
legendary
dwellers
in
the
deep
the
krakens
the
octopuses
the
leviathans
the
famous
at
any
rate
since
this
monster
whatever
it
was
had
appeared
along
the
new
england
shores
the
little
and
pleasure
boats
dared
not
venture
forth
wherever
it
appeared
the
boats
fled
to
the
nearest
harbor
as
was
but
prudent
if
the
animal
was
of
a
ferocious
character
none
cared
to
await
its
attack
as
to
the
large
ships
and
coast
steamers
they
had
nothing
to
fear
from
any
monster
whale
or
otherwise
several
of
them
had
seen
this
creature
at
a
distance
of
some
miles
but
when
they
attempted
to
approach
it
fled
rapidly
away
one
day
even
a
fast
united
states
gun
boat
went
out
from
boston
if
not
to
pursue
the
monster
at
least
to
send
after
it
a
few
cannon
shot
almost
instantly
the
animal
disappeared
and
the
attempt
was
vain
as
yet
however
the
monster
had
shown
no
intention
of
attacking
either
boats
or
people
at
this
moment
ward
returned
and
i
interrupted
my
reading
to
say
there
seems
as
yet
no
reason
to
complain
of
this
it
flees
before
big
ships
it
does
not
pursue
little
ones
feeling
and
intelligence
are
not
very
strong
in
fishes
yet
their
emotions
exist
strock
and
if
strongly
aroused
but
ward
the
beast
seems
not
at
all
dangerous
one
of
two
things
will
happen
either
it
will
presently
quit
these
coasts
or
finally
it
will
be
captured
and
we
shall
be
able
to
study
it
at
our
leisure
here
in
the
museum
of
washington
and
if
it
is
not
a
marine
animal
asked
ward
what
else
can
it
be
i
protested
in
surprise
finish
your
reading
said
ward
i
did
so
and
found
that
in
the
second
part
of
the
report
my
chief
had
underlined
some
passages
in
red
pencil
for
some
time
no
one
had
doubted
that
this
was
an
animal
and
that
if
it
were
vigorously
pursued
it
would
at
last
be
driven
from
our
shores
but
a
change
of
opinion
had
come
about
people
began
to
ask
if
instead
of
a
fish
this
were
not
some
new
and
remarkable
kind
of
boat
certainly
in
that
case
its
engine
must
be
one
of
amazing
power
perhaps
the
inventor
before
selling
the
secret
of
his
invention
sought
to
attract
public
attention
and
to
astound
the
maritime
world
such
surety
in
the
movements
of
his
boat
grace
in
its
every
evolution
such
ease
in
defying
pursuit
by
its
speed
surely
these
were
enough
to
arouse
curiosity
at
that
time
great
progress
had
been
made
in
the
manufacture
of
marine
engines
huge
transatlantic
steamers
completed
the
ocean
passage
in
five
days
and
the
engineers
had
not
yet
spoken
their
last
word
neither
were
the
navies
of
the
world
behind
the
cruisers
the
torpedo
boats
the
could
match
the
swiftest
steamers
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
or
of
the
indian
trade
if
however
this
were
a
boat
of
some
new
design
there
had
as
yet
been
no
opportunity
to
observe
its
form
as
to
the
engines
which
drove
it
they
must
be
of
a
power
far
beyond
the
fastest
known
by
what
force
they
worked
was
equally
a
problem
since
the
boat
had
no
sails
it
was
not
driven
by
the
wind
and
since
it
had
no
it
was
not
driven
by
steam
at
this
point
in
the
report
i
again
paused
in
my
reading
and
considered
the
comment
i
wished
to
make
what
are
you
puzzling
over
strock
demanded
my
chief
it
is
this
ward
the
motive
power
of
this
boat
must
be
as
tremendous
and
as
unknown
as
that
of
the
remarkable
automobile
which
has
so
amazed
us
all
so
that
is
your
idea
is
it
strock
yes
mr
ward
there
was
but
one
conclusion
to
be
drawn
if
the
mysterious
chauffeur
had
disappeared
if
he
had
perished
with
his
machine
in
lake
michigan
it
was
equally
important
now
to
win
the
secret
of
this
no
less
mysterious
navigator
and
it
must
be
won
before
he
in
his
turn
plunged
into
the
abyss
of
the
ocean
was
it
not
the
interest
of
the
inventor
to
disclose
his
invention
would
not
the
american
government
or
any
other
give
him
any
price
he
chose
to
ask
yet
unfortunately
since
the
inventor
of
the
terrestrial
apparition
had
persisted
in
preserving
his
incognito
was
it
not
to
be
feared
that
the
inventor
of
the
marine
apparition
would
equally
preserve
his
even
if
the
first
machine
still
existed
it
was
no
longer
heard
from
and
would
not
the
second
in
the
same
way
after
having
disclosed
its
powers
disappear
in
its
turn
without
a
single
trace
what
gave
weight
to
this
probability
was
that
since
the
arrival
of
this
report
at
washington
hours
before
the
presence
of
the
extraordinary
boat
had
been
announced
from
anywhere
along
the
shore
neither
had
it
been
seen
on
any
other
coast
though
of
course
the
assertion
that
it
would
not
reappear
at
all
would
have
been
hazardous
to
say
the
least
i
noted
another
interesting
and
possibly
important
point
it
was
a
singular
coincidence
which
indeed
ward
suggested
to
me
at
the
same
moment
that
i
was
considering
it
this
was
that
only
after
the
disappearance
of
the
wonderful
automobile
had
the
no
less
wonderful
boat
come
into
view
moreover
their
engines
both
possessed
a
most
dangerous
power
of
locomotion
if
both
should
go
rushing
at
the
same
time
over
the
face
of
the
world
the
same
danger
would
threaten
mankind
everywhere
in
boats
in
vehicles
and
on
foot
therefore
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
the
police
should
in
some
manner
interfere
to
protect
the
public
ways
of
travel
that
is
what
ward
pointed
out
to
me
and
our
duty
was
obvious
but
how
could
we
accomplish
this
task
we
discussed
the
matter
for
some
time
and
i
was
just
about
to
leave
when
ward
made
one
last
suggestion
have
you
not
observed
strock
said
he
that
there
is
a
sort
of
fantastic
resemblance
between
the
general
appearance
of
this
boat
and
this
automobile
there
is
something
of
the
sort
mr
ward
well
is
it
not
possible
that
the
two
are
one
chapter
the
first
letter
after
leaving
ward
i
returned
to
my
home
in
long
street
there
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
consider
this
strange
case
uninterrupted
by
either
wife
or
children
my
household
consisted
solely
of
an
ancient
servant
who
having
been
formerly
in
the
service
of
my
mother
had
now
continued
for
fifteen
years
in
mine
two
months
before
i
had
obtained
a
leave
of
absence
it
had
still
two
weeks
to
run
unless
indeed
some
unforeseen
circumstance
interrupted
it
some
mission
which
could
not
be
delayed
this
leave
as
i
have
shown
had
already
been
interrupted
for
four
days
by
my
exploration
of
the
great
eyrie
and
now
was
it
not
my
duty
to
abandon
my
vacation
and
endeavor
to
throw
light
upon
the
remarkable
events
of
which
the
road
to
milwaukee
and
the
shore
of
new
england
had
been
in
turn
the
scene
i
would
have
given
much
to
solve
the
twin
mysteries
but
how
was
it
possible
to
follow
the
track
of
this
automobile
or
this
boat
seated
in
my
easy
chair
after
breakfast
with
my
pipe
lighted
i
opened
my
newspaper
to
what
should
i
turn
politics
interested
me
but
little
with
its
eternal
strife
between
the
republicans
and
the
democrats
neither
did
i
care
for
the
news
of
society
nor
for
the
sporting
page
you
will
not
be
surprised
then
that
my
first
idea
was
to
see
if
there
was
any
news
from
north
carolina
about
the
great
eyrie
there
was
little
hope
of
this
however
for
smith
had
promised
to
telegraph
me
at
once
if
anything
occurred
i
felt
quite
sure
that
the
mayor
of
morganton
was
as
eager
for
information
and
as
watchful
as
could
have
been
myself
the
paper
told
me
nothing
new
it
dropped
idly
from
my
hand
and
i
remained
deep
in
thought
what
most
frequently
recurred
to
me
was
the
suggestion
of
ward
that
perhaps
the
automobile
and
the
boat
which
had
attracted
our
attention
were
in
reality
one
and
the
same
very
probably
at
least
the
two
machines
had
been
built
by
the
same
hand
and
beyond
doubt
these
were
similar
engines
which
generated
this
remarkable
speed
more
than
doubling
the
previous
records
of
earth
and
sea
the
same
inventor
repeated
evidently
this
hypothesis
had
strong
grounds
the
fact
that
the
two
machines
had
not
yet
appeared
at
the
same
time
added
weight
to
the
idea
i
murmured
to
myself
after
the
mystery
of
great
eyrie
comes
that
of
milwaukee
and
boston
will
this
new
problem
be
as
difficult
to
solve
as
was
the
other
i
noted
idly
that
this
new
affair
had
a
general
resemblance
to
the
other
since
both
menaced
the
security
of
the
general
public
to
be
sure
only
the
inhabitants
of
the
blueridge
region
had
been
in
danger
from
an
eruption
or
possible
earthquake
at
great
eyrie
while
now
on
every
road
of
the
united
states
or
along
every
league
of
its
coasts
and
harbors
every
inhabitant
was
in
danger
from
this
vehicle
or
this
boat
with
its
sudden
appearance
and
insane
speed
i
found
that
as
was
to
be
expected
the
newspapers
not
only
suggested
but
enlarged
upon
the
dangers
of
the
case
timid
people
everywhere
were
much
alarmed
my
old
servant
naturally
credulous
and
superstitious
was
particularly
upset
that
same
day
after
dinner
as
she
was
clearing
away
the
things
she
stopped
before
me
a
water
bottle
in
one
hand
the
serviette
in
the
other
and
asked
anxiously
is
there
no
news
sir
none
i
answered
knowing
well
to
what
she
referred
the
automobile
has
not
come
back
no
nor
the
boat
nor
the
boat
there
is
no
news
the
best
informed
papers
but
your
secret
police
information
we
are
no
wiser
then
sir
if
you
please
of
what
use
are
the
police
it
is
a
question
which
has
phased
me
more
than
once
now
you
see
what
will
happen
continued
the
old
housekeeper
complainingly
some
fine
morning
he
will
come
without
warning
this
terrible
chauffeur
and
rush
down
our
street
here
and
kill
us
all
good
when
that
happens
there
will
be
some
chance
of
catching
him
he
will
never
be
arrested
sir
why
not
because
he
is
the
devil
himself
and
you
ca
arrest
the
devil
decidedly
thought
i
the
devil
has
many
uses
and
if
he
did
not
exist
we
would
have
to
invent
him
to
give
people
some
way
of
explaining
the
inexplicable
it
was
he
who
lit
the
flames
of
the
great
eyrie
it
was
he
who
smashed
the
record
in
the
wisconsin
race
it
is
he
who
is
scurrying
along
the
shores
of
connecticut
and
massachusetts
but
putting
to
one
side
this
evil
spirit
who
is
so
necessary
for
the
convenience
of
the
ignorant
there
was
no
doubt
that
we
were
facing
a
most
bewildering
problem
had
both
of
these
machines
disappeared
forever
they
had
passed
like
a
meteor
like
a
star
shooting
through
space
and
in
a
hundred
years
the
adventure
would
become
a
legend
much
to
the
taste
of
the
gossips
of
the
next
century
for
several
days
the
newspapers
of
america
and
even
those
of
europe
continued
to
discuss
these
events
editorials
crowded
upon
editorials
rumors
were
added
to
rumors
story
tellers
of
every
kind
crowded
to
the
front
the
public
of
two
continents
was
interested
in
some
parts
of
europe
there
was
even
jealousy
that
america
should
have
been
chosen
as
the
field
of
such
an
experience
if
these
marvelous
inventors
were
american
then
their
country
their
army
and
navy
would
have
a
great
advantage
over
others
the
united
states
might
acquire
an
incontestable
superiority
under
the
date
of
the
tenth
of
june
a
new
york
paper
published
a
carefully
studied
article
on
this
phase
of
the
subject
comparing
the
speed
of
the
swiftest
known
vessels
with
the
smallest
minimum
of
speed
which
could
possibly
be
assigned
to
the
new
boat
the
article
demonstrated
that
if
the
united
states
secured
this
secret
europe
would
be
but
three
days
away
from
her
while
she
would
still
be
five
days
from
europe
if
our
own
police
had
searched
diligently
to
discover
the
mystery
of
the
great
eyrie
the
secret
service
of
every
country
in
the
world
was
now
interested
in
these
new
problems
ward
referred
to
the
matter
each
time
i
saw
him
our
chat
would
begin
by
his
rallying
me
about
my
in
carolina
and
i
would
respond
by
reminding
him
that
success
there
was
only
a
question
of
expense
never
mind
my
good
strock
said
he
there
will
come
a
chance
for
our
clever
inspector
to
regain
his
laurels
take
now
this
affair
of
the
automobile
and
the
boat
if
you
could
clear
that
up
in
advance
of
all
the
detectives
of
the
world
what
an
honor
it
would
be
to
our
department
what
glory
for
you
it
certainly
would
ward
and
if
you
put
the
matter
in
my
charge
who
knows
strock
let
us
wait
a
while
let
us
wait
matters
stood
thus
when
on
the
morning
of
june
fifteenth
my
old
servant
brought
me
a
letter
from
the
a
registered
letter
for
which
i
had
to
sign
i
looked
at
the
address
i
did
not
know
the
handwriting
the
postmark
dating
from
two
days
before
was
stamped
at
the
post
office
of
morganton
morganton
here
at
last
was
no
doubt
news
from
elias
smith
yes
exclaimed
i
speaking
to
my
old
servant
for
lack
of
another
it
must
be
from
smith
at
last
i
know
no
one
else
in
morganton
and
if
he
writes
he
has
news
morganton
said
the
old
woman
is
that
the
place
where
the
demons
set
fire
to
their
mountain
exactly
oh
sir
i
hope
you
do
mean
to
go
back
there
because
you
will
end
by
being
burned
up
in
that
furnace
of
the
great
eyrie
and
i
would
want
you
buried
that
way
sir
cheer
up
and
let
us
see
if
it
is
not
better
news
than
that
the
envelope
was
sealed
with
red
sealing
wax
and
stamped
with
a
sort
of
coat
of
arms
surmounted
with
three
stars
the
paper
was
thick
and
very
strong
i
broke
the
envelope
and
drew
out
a
letter
it
was
a
single
sheet
folded
in
four
and
written
on
one
side
only
my
first
glance
was
for
the
signature
there
was
no
signature
nothing
but
three
initials
at
the
end
of
the
last
line
the
letter
is
not
from
the
mayor
of
morganton
said
i
then
from
whom
asked
the
old
servant
doubly
curious
in
her
quality
as
a
woman
and
as
an
old
gossip
looking
again
at
the
three
initials
of
the
signature
i
said
i
know
no
one
for
whom
these
letters
would
stand
neither
at
morganton
nor
elsewhere
the
was
bold
both
up
strokes
and
down
strokes
very
sharp
about
twenty
lines
in
all
here
is
the
letter
of
which
i
with
good
reason
retained
an
exact
copy
it
was
dated
to
my
extreme
stupefaction
from
that
mysterious
great
eyrie
great
eyrie
blueridge
mtns
to
strock
north
carolina
june
chief
inspector
of
police
long
washington
sir
you
were
charged
with
the
mission
of
penetrating
the
great
eyrie
you
came
on
april
the
accompanied
by
the
mayor
of
morganton
and
two
guides
you
mounted
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
you
encircled
it
finding
it
too
high
and
steep
to
climb
you
sought
a
breech
and
you
found
none
know
this
none
enter
the
great
eyrie
or
if
one
enters
he
never
returns
do
not
try
again
for
the
second
attempt
will
not
result
as
did
the
first
but
will
have
grave
consequences
for
you
heed
this
warning
or
evil
fortune
will
come
to
you
chapter
a
third
machine
i
confess
that
at
first
this
letter
dumfounded
me
ohs
and
ahs
slipped
from
my
open
mouth
the
old
servant
stared
at
me
not
knowing
what
to
think
oh
sir
is
it
bad
news
i
answered
for
i
kept
few
secrets
from
this
faithful
soul
by
reading
her
the
letter
from
end
to
end
she
listened
with
much
anxiety
a
joke
without
doubt
said
i
shrugging
my
shoulders
well
returned
my
superstitious
handmaid
if
it
is
from
the
devil
it
from
the
devil
country
anyway
left
alone
i
again
went
over
this
unexpected
letter
reflection
inclined
me
yet
more
strongly
to
believe
that
it
was
the
work
of
a
practical
joker
my
adventure
was
well
known
the
newspapers
had
given
it
in
full
detail
some
satirist
such
as
exists
even
in
america
must
have
written
this
threatening
letter
to
mock
me
to
assume
on
the
other
hand
that
the
eyrie
really
served
as
the
refuge
of
a
band
of
criminals
seemed
absurd
if
they
feared
that
the
police
would
discover
their
retreat
surely
they
would
not
have
been
so
foolish
as
thus
to
force
attention
upon
themselves
their
chief
security
would
lie
in
keeping
their
presence
there
unknown
they
must
have
realized
that
such
a
challenge
from
them
would
only
arouse
the
police
to
renewed
activity
dynamite
or
melinite
would
soon
open
an
entrance
to
their
fortress
moreover
how
could
these
men
have
themselves
gained
entrance
into
the
eyrie
unless
there
existed
a
passage
which
we
had
failed
to
discover
assuredly
the
letter
came
from
a
jester
or
a
madman
and
i
need
not
worry
over
it
nor
even
consider
it
hence
though
for
an
instant
i
had
thought
of
showing
this
letter
to
ward
i
decided
not
to
do
so
surely
he
would
attach
no
importance
to
it
however
i
did
not
destroy
it
but
locked
it
in
my
desk
for
safe
keeping
if
more
letters
came
of
the
same
kind
and
with
the
same
initials
i
would
attach
as
little
weight
to
them
as
to
this
several
days
passed
quietly
there
was
nothing
to
lead
me
to
expect
that
i
should
soon
quit
washington
though
in
my
line
of
duty
one
is
never
certain
of
the
morrow
at
any
moment
i
might
be
sent
speeding
from
oregon
to
florida
from
maine
to
texas
and
this
unpleasant
thought
haunted
me
frequently
if
my
next
mission
were
no
more
successful
than
that
to
the
great
eyrie
i
might
as
well
give
up
and
hand
in
my
resignation
from
the
force
of
the
mysterious
chauffeur
or
chauffeurs
nothing
more
was
heard
i
knew
that
our
own
government
agents
as
well
as
foreign
ones
were
keeping
keen
watch
over
all
the
roads
and
rivers
all
the
lakes
and
the
coasts
of
america
of
course
the
size
of
the
country
made
any
close
supervision
impossible
but
these
twin
inventors
had
not
before
chosen
secluded
and
unfrequented
spots
in
which
to
appear
the
main
highway
of
wisconsin
on
a
great
race
day
the
harbor
of
boston
incessantly
crossed
by
thousands
of
boats
these
were
hardly
what
would
be
called
if
the
daring
driver
had
not
perished
of
which
there
was
always
strong
probability
then
he
must
have
left
america
perhaps
he
was
in
the
waters
of
the
old
world
or
else
resting
in
some
retreat
known
only
to
himself
and
in
that
case
ah
i
repeated
to
myself
many
times
for
such
a
retreat
as
secret
as
inaccessible
this
fantastic
personage
could
not
find
one
better
than
the
great
eyrie
but
of
course
a
boat
could
not
get
there
any
more
than
an
automobile
only
birds
of
prey
eagles
or
condors
could
find
refuge
there
the
nineteenth
of
june
i
was
going
to
the
police
bureau
when
on
leaving
my
house
i
noticed
two
men
who
looked
at
me
with
a
certain
keenness
not
knowing
them
i
took
no
notice
and
if
my
attention
was
drawn
to
the
matter
it
was
because
my
servant
spoke
of
it
when
i
returned
for
some
days
she
said
she
had
noticed
that
two
men
seemed
to
be
spying
upon
me
in
the
street
they
stood
constantly
perhaps
a
hundred
steps
from
my
house
and
she
suspected
that
they
followed
me
each
time
i
went
up
the
street
you
are
sure
i
asked
yes
sir
and
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
when
you
came
into
the
house
these
men
came
slipping
along
in
your
footsteps
and
then
went
away
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
behind
you
you
must
be
mistaken
i
am
not
sir
and
if
you
met
these
two
men
you
would
know
them
i
would
good
i
cried
laughing
i
see
you
have
the
very
spirit
for
a
detective
i
must
engage
you
as
a
member
of
our
force
joke
if
you
like
sir
but
i
have
still
two
good
eyes
and
i
need
spectacles
to
recognize
people
someone
is
spying
on
you
certain
and
you
should
put
some
of
your
men
to
track
them
in
turn
all
right
i
promise
to
do
so
i
said
to
satisfy
her
and
when
my
men
get
after
them
we
shall
soon
know
what
these
mysterious
fellows
want
of
me
in
truth
i
did
not
take
the
good
soul
excited
announcement
very
seriously
i
added
however
when
i
go
out
i
will
watch
the
people
around
me
with
great
care
that
will
be
best
sir
my
poor
old
housekeeper
was
always
frightening
herself
at
nothing
if
i
see
them
again
she
added
i
will
warn
you
before
you
set
foot
out
of
doors
agreed
and
i
broke
off
the
conversation
knowing
well
that
if
i
allowed
her
to
run
on
she
would
end
by
being
sure
that
beelzebub
himself
and
one
of
his
chief
attendants
were
at
my
heels
the
two
following
days
there
was
certainly
no
one
spying
on
me
either
at
my
exits
or
entrances
so
i
concluded
my
old
servant
had
made
much
of
nothing
as
usual
but
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
after
rushing
upstairs
as
rapidly
as
her
age
would
permit
the
devoted
old
soul
burst
into
my
room
and
in
a
half
whisper
gasped
sir
sir
what
is
it
they
are
there
who
i
queried
my
mind
on
anything
but
the
web
she
had
been
spinning
about
me
the
two
spies
ah
those
wonderful
spies
themselves
in
the
street
right
in
front
of
our
windows
watching
the
house
waiting
for
you
to
go
out
i
went
to
the
window
and
raising
just
an
edge
of
the
shade
so
as
not
to
give
any
warning
i
saw
two
men
on
the
pavement
they
were
rather
men
and
vigorous
aged
somewhat
under
forty
dressed
in
the
ordinary
fashion
of
the
day
with
slouched
hats
heavy
woolen
suits
stout
walking
shoes
and
sticks
in
hand
undoubtedly
they
were
staring
persistently
at
my
apparently
unwatchful
house
then
having
exchanged
a
few
words
they
strolled
off
a
little
way
and
returned
again
are
you
sure
these
are
the
same
men
you
saw
before
yes
sir
evidently
i
could
no
longer
dismiss
her
warning
as
an
hallucination
and
i
promised
myself
to
clear
up
the
matter
as
to
following
the
men
myself
i
was
presumably
too
well
known
to
them
to
address
them
directly
would
probably
be
of
no
use
but
that
very
day
one
of
our
best
men
should
be
put
on
watch
and
if
the
spies
returned
on
the
morrow
they
should
be
tracked
in
their
turn
and
watched
until
their
identity
was
established
at
the
moment
they
were
waiting
to
follow
me
to
police
headquarters
for
it
was
there
that
i
was
bound
as
usual
if
they
accompanied
me
i
might
be
able
to
offer
them
a
hospitality
for
which
they
would
scarce
thank
me
i
took
my
hat
and
while
the
housekeeper
remained
peeping
from
the
window
i
went
down
stairs
opened
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
street
the
two
men
were
no
longer
there
despite
all
my
watchfulness
that
day
i
saw
no
more
of
them
as
i
passed
along
the
streets
from
that
time
on
indeed
neither
my
old
servant
nor
i
saw
them
again
before
the
house
nor
did
i
encounter
them
elsewhere
their
appearance
however
was
stamped
upon
my
memory
i
would
not
forget
them
perhaps
after
all
admitting
that
i
had
been
the
object
of
their
espionage
they
had
been
mistaken
in
my
identity
having
obtained
a
good
look
at
me
they
now
followed
me
no
more
so
in
the
end
i
came
to
regard
this
matter
as
of
no
more
importance
than
the
letter
with
the
initials
then
on
the
of
june
there
came
a
new
event
to
further
stimulate
both
my
interest
and
that
of
the
general
public
in
the
previous
mysteries
of
the
automobile
and
the
boat
the
washington
evening
star
published
the
following
account
which
was
next
morning
copied
by
every
paper
in
the
country
lake
kirdall
in
kansas
forty
miles
west
of
topeka
is
little
known
it
deserves
wider
knowledge
and
doubtless
will
have
it
hereafter
for
attention
is
now
drawn
to
it
in
a
very
remarkable
way
this
lake
deep
among
the
mountains
appears
to
have
no
outlet
what
it
loses
by
evaporation
it
regains
from
the
little
neighboring
streamlets
and
the
heavy
rains
lake
kirdall
covers
about
square
miles
and
its
level
is
but
slightly
below
that
of
the
heights
which
surround
it
shut
in
among
the
mountains
it
can
be
reached
only
by
narrow
and
rocky
gorges
several
villages
however
have
sprung
up
upon
its
banks
it
is
full
of
fish
and
cover
its
waters
lake
kirdall
is
in
many
places
fifty
feet
deep
close
to
shore
sharp
pointed
rocks
form
the
edges
of
this
huge
basin
its
surges
roused
by
high
winds
beat
upon
its
banks
with
fury
and
the
houses
near
at
hand
are
often
deluged
with
spray
as
if
with
the
downpour
of
a
hurricane
the
lake
already
deep
at
the
edge
becomes
yet
deeper
toward
the
center
where
in
some
places
soundings
show
over
three
hundred
feet
of
water
the
fishing
industry
supports
a
population
of
several
thousands
and
there
are
several
hundred
fishing
boats
in
addition
to
the
dozen
or
so
of
little
steamers
which
serve
the
traffic
of
the
lake
beyond
the
circle
of
the
mountains
lie
the
railroads
which
transport
the
products
of
the
fishing
industry
throughout
kansas
and
the
neighboring
states
this
account
of
lake
kirdall
is
necessary
for
the
understanding
of
the
remarkable
facts
which
we
are
about
to
report
and
this
is
what
the
evening
star
then
reported
in
its
startling
article
for
some
time
past
the
fishermen
have
noticed
a
strange
upheaval
in
the
waters
of
the
lake
sometimes
it
rises
as
if
a
wave
surged
up
from
its
depths
even
in
perfectly
calm
weather
when
there
is
no
wind
whatever
this
upheaval
sometimes
arises
in
a
mass
of
foam
tossed
about
by
violent
waves
and
unaccountable
currents
boats
have
been
swept
beyond
all
control
sometimes
they
have
been
dashed
one
against
another
and
serious
damage
has
resulted
this
confusion
of
the
waters
evidently
has
its
origin
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
lake
and
various
explanations
have
been
offered
to
account
for
it
at
first
it
was
suggested
that
the
trouble
was
due
to
seismic
forces
to
some
volcanic
action
beneath
the
lake
but
this
hypothesis
had
to
be
rejected
when
it
was
recognized
that
the
disturbance
was
not
confined
to
one
locality
but
spread
itself
over
the
entire
surface
of
the
lake
either
at
one
part
or
another
in
the
center
or
along
the
edges
traveling
along
almost
in
a
regular
line
and
in
a
way
to
exclude
entirely
all
idea
of
earthquake
or
volcanic
action
another
hypothesis
suggested
that
it
was
a
marine
monster
who
thus
upheaved
the
waters
but
unless
the
beast
had
been
born
in
the
lake
and
had
there
grown
to
its
gigantic
proportions
unsuspected
which
was
scarce
possible
he
must
have
come
there
from
outside
lake
kirdall
however
has
no
connection
with
any
other
waters
if
this
lake
were
situated
near
any
of
the
oceans
there
might
be
subterranean
canals
but
in
the
center
of
america
and
at
the
height
of
some
thousands
of
feet
above
this
is
not
possible
in
short
here
is
another
riddle
not
easy
to
solve
and
it
is
much
easier
to
point
out
the
impossibility
of
false
explanations
than
to
discover
the
true
one
is
it
possible
that
a
submarine
boat
is
being
experimented
with
beneath
the
lake
such
boats
are
no
longer
impossible
today
some
years
ago
at
bridgeport
connecticut
there
was
launched
a
boat
the
protector
which
could
go
on
the
water
under
the
water
and
also
upon
land
built
by
an
inventor
named
lake
supplied
with
two
motors
an
electric
one
of
horse
power
and
a
gasoline
one
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
horse
power
it
was
also
provided
with
wheels
a
yard
in
diameter
which
enabled
it
to
roll
over
the
roads
as
well
as
swim
the
seas
but
even
then
granting
that
the
turmoil
of
lake
kirdall
might
be
produced
by
a
submarine
brought
to
a
high
degree
of
perfection
there
remains
as
before
the
question
how
could
it
have
reached
lake
kirdall
the
lake
shut
in
on
all
sides
by
a
circle
of
mountains
is
no
more
accessible
to
a
submarine
than
to
a
in
whatever
way
this
last
puzzling
question
may
be
solved
the
nature
of
this
strange
appearance
can
no
longer
be
disputed
since
the
twentieth
of
june
on
that
day
in
the
afternoon
the
schooner
markel
while
speeding
with
all
sails
set
came
into
violent
collision
with
something
just
below
the
water
level
there
was
no
shoal
nor
rock
near
for
the
lake
in
this
part
is
eighty
or
ninety
feet
deep
the
schooner
with
both
her
bow
and
her
side
badly
broken
ran
great
danger
of
sinking
she
managed
however
to
reach
the
shore
before
her
decks
were
completely
submerged
when
the
had
been
pumped
out
and
hauled
up
on
shore
an
examination
showed
that
she
had
received
a
blow
near
the
bow
as
if
from
a
powerful
ram
from
this
it
seems
evident
that
there
is
actually
a
submarine
boat
which
darts
about
beneath
the
surface
of
lake
kirdall
with
most
remarkable
rapidity
the
thing
is
difficult
to
explain
not
only
is
there
a
question
as
to
how
did
the
submarine
get
there
but
why
is
it
there
why
does
it
never
come
to
the
surface
what
reason
has
its
owner
for
remaining
unknown
are
other
disasters
to
be
expected
from
its
reckless
course
the
article
in
the
evening
star
closed
with
this
truly
striking
suggestion
after
the
mysterious
automobile
came
the
mysterious
boat
now
comes
the
mysterious
submarine
must
we
conclude
that
the
three
engines
are
due
to
the
genius
of
the
same
inventor
and
that
the
three
vehicles
are
in
truth
but
one
chapter
at
any
cost
the
suggestion
of
the
star
came
like
a
revelation
it
was
accepted
everywhere
not
only
were
these
three
vehicles
the
work
of
the
same
inventor
they
were
the
same
machine
it
was
not
easy
to
see
how
the
remarkable
transformation
could
be
practically
accomplished
from
one
means
of
locomotion
to
the
other
how
could
an
automobile
become
a
boat
and
yet
more
a
submarine
all
the
machine
seemed
to
lack
was
the
power
of
flying
through
the
air
nevertheless
everything
that
was
known
of
the
three
different
machines
as
to
their
size
their
shape
their
lack
of
odor
or
of
steam
and
above
all
their
remarkable
speed
seemed
to
imply
their
identity
the
public
grown
blase
with
so
many
excitements
found
in
this
new
marvel
a
stimulus
to
reawaken
their
curiosity
the
newspapers
dwelt
now
chiefly
on
the
importance
of
the
invention
this
new
engine
whether
in
one
vehicle
or
three
had
given
proofs
of
its
power
what
amazing
proofs
the
invention
must
be
bought
at
any
price
the
united
states
government
must
purchase
it
at
once
for
the
use
of
the
nation
assuredly
the
great
european
powers
would
stop
at
nothing
to
be
beforehand
with
america
and
gain
possession
of
an
engine
so
invaluable
for
military
and
naval
use
what
incalculable
advantages
would
it
give
to
any
nation
both
on
land
and
sea
its
destructive
powers
could
not
even
be
estimated
until
its
qualities
and
limitations
were
better
known
no
amount
of
money
would
be
too
great
to
pay
for
the
secret
america
could
not
put
her
millions
to
better
use
but
to
buy
the
machine
it
was
necessary
to
find
the
inventor
and
there
seemed
the
chief
difficulty
in
vain
was
lake
kirdall
searched
from
end
to
end
even
its
depths
were
explored
with
a
without
result
must
it
be
concluded
that
the
submarine
no
longer
lurked
beneath
its
waters
but
in
that
case
how
had
the
boat
gotten
away
for
that
matter
how
had
it
come
an
insoluble
problem
the
submarine
was
heard
from
no
more
neither
in
lake
kirdall
nor
elsewhere
it
had
disappeared
like
the
automobile
from
the
roads
and
like
the
boat
from
the
shores
of
america
several
times
in
my
interviews
with
ward
we
discussed
this
matter
which
still
filled
his
mind
our
men
continued
everywhere
on
the
lookout
but
as
unsuccessfully
as
other
agents
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
i
was
summoned
into
the
presence
of
ward
well
strock
said
he
here
is
a
splendid
chance
for
you
to
get
your
revenge
revenge
for
the
great
eyrie
disappointment
of
course
what
chance
asked
i
not
knowing
if
he
spoke
seriously
or
in
jest
why
here
he
answered
would
not
you
like
to
discover
the
inventor
of
this
machine
i
certainly
should
ward
give
me
the
order
to
take
charge
of
the
matter
and
i
will
accomplish
the
impossible
in
order
to
succeed
it
is
true
i
believe
it
will
be
difficult
undoubtedly
strock
perhaps
even
more
difficult
than
to
penetrate
into
the
great
eyrie
it
was
evident
that
ward
was
intent
on
rallying
me
about
my
unsuccess
he
would
not
do
that
i
felt
assured
out
of
mere
unkindness
perhaps
then
he
meant
to
rouse
my
resolution
he
knew
me
well
and
realized
that
i
would
have
given
anything
in
the
world
to
recoup
my
defeat
i
waited
quietly
for
new
instructions
ward
dropped
his
jesting
and
said
to
me
very
generously
i
know
strock
that
you
accomplished
everything
that
depended
on
human
powers
and
that
no
blame
attaches
to
you
but
we
face
now
a
matter
very
different
from
that
of
the
great
eyrie
the
day
the
government
decides
to
force
that
secret
everything
is
ready
we
have
only
to
spend
some
thousands
of
dollars
and
the
road
will
be
open
that
is
what
i
would
urge
but
at
present
said
ward
shaking
his
head
it
is
much
more
important
to
place
our
hands
on
this
fantastic
inventor
who
so
constantly
escapes
us
that
is
work
for
a
detective
indeed
a
master
detective
he
has
not
been
heard
from
again
no
and
though
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
has
been
and
still
continues
beneath
the
waters
of
lake
kirdall
it
has
been
impossible
to
find
any
trace
of
him
anywhere
around
there
one
would
almost
fancy
he
had
the
power
of
making
himself
invisible
this
proteus
of
a
mechanic
it
seems
likely
said
i
that
he
will
never
be
seen
until
he
wishes
to
be
true
strock
and
to
my
mind
there
is
only
one
way
of
dealing
with
him
and
that
is
to
offer
him
such
an
enormous
price
that
he
can
not
refuse
to
sell
his
invention
ward
was
right
indeed
the
government
had
already
made
the
effort
to
secure
speech
with
this
hero
of
the
day
than
whom
surely
no
human
being
has
ever
better
merited
the
title
the
press
had
widely
spread
the
news
and
this
extraordinary
individual
must
assuredly
know
what
the
government
desired
of
him
and
how
completely
he
could
name
the
terms
he
wished
surely
added
ward
this
invention
can
be
of
no
personal
use
to
the
man
that
he
should
hide
it
from
the
rest
of
us
there
is
every
reason
why
he
should
sell
it
can
this
unknown
be
already
some
dangerous
criminal
who
thanks
to
his
machine
hopes
to
defy
all
pursuit
my
chief
then
went
on
to
explain
that
it
had
been
decided
to
employ
other
means
in
search
of
the
inventor
it
was
possible
after
all
that
he
had
perished
with
his
machine
in
some
dangerous
maneuver
if
so
the
ruined
vehicle
might
prove
almost
as
valuable
and
instructive
to
the
mechanical
world
as
the
man
himself
but
since
the
accident
to
the
schooner
markel
on
lake
kirdall
no
news
of
him
whatever
had
reached
the
police
on
this
point
ward
did
not
attempt
to
hide
his
disappointment
and
his
anxiety
anxiety
yes
for
it
was
manifestly
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
for
him
to
fulfill
his
duty
of
protecting
the
public
how
could
we
arrest
criminals
if
they
could
flee
from
justice
at
such
speed
over
both
land
and
sea
how
could
we
pursue
them
under
the
oceans
and
when
dirigible
balloons
should
also
have
reached
their
full
perfection
we
would
even
have
to
chase
men
through
the
air
i
asked
myself
if
my
colleagues
and
i
would
not
find
ourselves
some
day
reduced
to
utter
helplessness
if
police
officials
become
a
useless
incumbrance
would
be
definitely
discarded
by
society
here
there
recurred
to
me
the
jesting
letter
i
had
received
a
fortnight
before
the
letter
which
threatened
my
liberty
and
even
my
life
i
recalled
also
the
singular
espionage
of
which
i
had
been
the
subject
i
asked
myself
if
i
had
better
mention
these
things
to
ward
but
they
seemed
to
have
absolutely
no
relation
to
the
matter
now
in
hand
the
great
eyrie
affair
had
been
definitely
put
aside
by
the
government
since
an
eruption
was
no
longer
threatening
and
they
now
wished
to
employ
me
upon
this
newer
matter
i
waited
then
to
mention
this
letter
to
my
chief
at
some
future
time
when
it
would
be
not
so
sore
a
joke
to
me
ward
again
took
up
our
conversation
we
are
resolved
by
some
means
to
establish
communication
with
this
inventor
he
has
disappeared
it
is
true
but
he
may
reappear
at
any
moment
and
in
any
part
of
the
country
i
have
chosen
you
strock
to
follow
him
the
instant
he
appears
you
must
hold
yourself
ready
to
leave
washington
on
the
moment
do
not
quit
your
house
except
to
come
here
to
headquarters
each
day
notify
me
each
time
by
telephone
when
you
start
from
home
and
report
to
me
personally
the
moment
you
arrive
here
i
will
follow
orders
exactly
ward
i
answered
but
permit
me
one
question
ought
i
to
act
alone
or
will
it
not
be
better
to
join
with
me
that
is
what
i
intend
said
the
chief
interrupting
me
you
are
to
choose
two
of
our
men
whom
you
think
the
best
fitted
i
will
do
so
ward
and
now
if
some
day
or
other
i
stand
in
the
presence
of
our
man
what
am
i
to
do
with
him
above
all
things
do
not
lose
sight
of
him
if
there
is
no
other
way
arrest
him
you
shall
have
a
warrant
a
useful
precaution
ward
if
he
started
to
jump
into
his
automobile
and
to
speed
away
at
the
rate
we
know
of
i
must
stop
him
at
any
cost
one
can
not
argue
long
with
a
man
making
two
hundred
miles
an
hour
you
must
prevent
that
strock
and
the
arrest
made
telegraph
me
after
that
the
matter
will
be
in
my
hands
count
on
me
ward
at
any
hour
day
or
night
i
shall
be
ready
to
start
with
my
men
i
thank
you
for
having
entrusted
this
mission
to
me
if
it
succeeds
it
will
be
a
great
honor
and
of
great
profit
added
my
chief
dismissing
me
returning
home
i
made
all
preparations
for
a
trip
of
indefinite
duration
perhaps
my
good
housekeeper
imagined
that
i
planned
a
return
to
the
great
eyrie
which
she
regarded
as
an
of
hell
itself
she
said
nothing
but
went
about
her
work
with
a
most
despairing
face
nevertheless
sure
as
i
was
of
her
discretion
i
told
her
nothing
in
this
great
mission
i
would
confide
in
no
one
my
choice
of
the
two
men
to
accompany
me
was
easily
made
they
both
belonged
to
my
own
department
and
had
many
times
under
my
direct
command
given
proofs
of
their
vigor
courage
and
intelligence
one
john
hart
of
illinois
was
a
man
of
thirty
years
the
other
aged
was
nab
walker
of
massachusetts
i
could
not
have
had
better
assistants
several
days
passed
without
news
either
of
the
automobile
the
boat
or
the
submarine
there
were
rumors
in
plenty
but
the
police
knew
them
to
be
false
as
to
the
reckless
stories
that
appeared
in
the
newspapers
they
had
most
of
them
no
foundation
whatever
even
the
best
journals
can
not
be
trusted
to
refuse
an
exciting
bit
of
news
on
the
mere
ground
of
its
unreliability
then
twice
in
quick
succession
there
came
what
seemed
trustworthy
reports
of
the
man
of
the
hour
the
first
asserted
that
he
had
been
seen
on
the
roads
of
arkansas
near
little
rock
the
second
that
he
was
in
the
very
middle
of
lake
superior
unfortunately
these
two
notices
were
absolutely
unreconcilable
for
while
the
first
gave
the
afternoon
of
june
as
the
time
of
appearance
the
second
set
it
for
the
evening
of
the
same
day
now
these
two
points
of
the
united
states
territory
are
not
less
than
eight
hundred
miles
apart
even
granting
the
automobile
this
unthinkable
speed
greater
than
any
it
had
yet
shown
how
could
it
have
crossed
all
the
intervening
country
unseen
how
could
it
traverse
the
states
of
arkansas
missouri
iowa
and
wisconsin
from
end
to
end
without
anyone
of
our
agents
giving
us
warning
without
any
interested
person
rushing
to
a
telephone
after
these
two
momentary
appearances
if
appearances
they
were
the
machine
again
dropped
out
of
knowledge
ward
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
dispatch
me
and
my
men
to
either
point
whence
it
had
been
reported
yet
since
this
marvelous
machine
seemed
still
in
existence
something
must
be
done
the
following
official
notice
was
published
in
every
newspaper
of
the
united
states
under
july
it
was
couched
in
the
most
formal
terms
during
the
month
of
april
of
the
present
year
an
automobile
traversed
the
roads
of
pennsylvania
of
kentucky
of
ohio
of
tennessee
of
missouri
of
illinois
and
on
the
of
may
during
the
race
held
by
the
american
automobile
club
it
covered
the
course
in
wisconsin
then
it
disappeared
during
the
first
week
of
june
a
boat
maneuvering
at
great
speed
appeared
off
the
coast
of
new
england
between
cape
cod
and
cape
sable
and
more
particularly
around
boston
then
it
disappeared
in
the
second
fortnight
of
the
same
month
a
submarine
boat
was
run
beneath
the
waters
of
lake
kirdall
in
kansas
then
it
disappeared
everything
points
to
the
belief
that
the
same
inventor
must
have
built
these
three
machines
or
perhaps
that
they
are
the
same
machine
constructed
so
as
to
travel
both
on
land
and
water
a
proposition
is
therefore
addressed
to
the
said
inventor
whoever
he
be
with
the
aim
of
acquiring
the
said
machine
he
is
requested
to
make
himself
known
and
to
name
the
terms
upon
which
he
will
treat
with
the
united
states
government
he
is
also
requested
to
answer
as
promptly
as
possible
to
the
department
of
federal
police
washington
united
states
of
america
such
was
the
notice
printed
in
large
type
on
the
front
page
of
every
newspaper
surely
it
could
not
fail
to
reach
the
eye
of
him
for
whom
it
was
intended
wherever
he
might
be
he
would
read
it
he
could
scarce
fail
to
answer
it
in
some
manner
and
why
should
he
refuse
such
an
unlimited
offer
we
had
only
to
await
his
reply
one
can
easily
imagine
how
high
the
public
curiosity
rose
from
morning
till
night
an
eager
and
noisy
crowd
pressed
about
the
bureau
of
police
awaiting
the
arrival
of
a
letter
or
a
telegram
the
best
reporters
were
on
the
spot
what
honor
what
profit
would
come
to
the
paper
which
was
first
to
publish
the
famous
news
to
know
at
last
the
name
and
place
of
the
undiscoverable
unknown
and
to
know
if
he
would
agree
to
some
bargain
with
the
government
it
goes
without
saying
that
america
does
things
on
a
magnificent
scale
millions
would
not
be
lacking
for
the
inventor
if
necessary
all
the
millionaires
in
the
country
would
open
their
inexhaustible
purses
the
day
passed
to
how
many
excited
and
impatient
people
it
seemed
to
contain
more
than
hours
and
each
hour
held
far
more
than
sixty
minutes
there
came
no
answer
no
letter
no
telegram
the
night
following
there
was
still
no
news
and
it
was
the
same
the
next
day
and
the
next
there
came
however
another
result
which
had
been
fully
foreseen
the
cables
informed
europe
of
what
the
united
states
government
had
done
the
different
powers
of
the
old
world
hoped
also
to
obtain
possession
of
the
wonderful
invention
why
should
they
not
struggle
for
an
advantage
so
tremendous
why
should
they
not
enter
the
contest
with
their
millions
in
brief
every
great
power
took
part
in
the
affair
france
england
russia
italy
austria
germany
only
the
states
of
the
second
order
refrained
from
entering
with
their
smaller
resources
upon
a
useless
effort
the
european
press
published
notices
identical
with
that
of
the
united
states
the
extraordinary
chauffeur
had
only
to
speak
to
become
a
rival
to
the
vanderbilts
the
astors
the
goulds
the
morgans
and
the
rothschilds
of
every
country
of
europe
and
when
the
mysterious
inventor
made
no
sign
what
attractive
offers
were
held
forth
to
tempt
him
to
discard
the
secrecy
in
which
he
was
enwrapped
the
whole
world
became
a
public
market
an
auction
house
whence
arose
the
most
amazing
bids
twice
a
day
the
newspapers
would
add
up
the
amounts
and
these
kept
rising
from
millions
to
millions
the
end
came
when
the
united
states
congress
after
a
memorable
session
voted
to
offer
the
sum
of
twenty
million
dollars
and
there
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
states
of
whatever
rank
who
objected
to
the
amount
so
much
importance
was
attached
to
the
possession
of
this
prodigious
engine
of
locomotion
as
for
me
i
said
emphatically
to
my
old
housekeeper
the
machine
is
worth
even
more
than
that
evidently
the
other
nations
of
the
world
did
not
think
so
for
their
bids
remained
below
the
final
sum
but
how
useless
was
this
mighty
struggle
of
the
great
rivals
the
inventor
did
not
appear
he
did
not
exist
he
had
never
existed
it
was
all
a
monstrous
pretense
of
the
american
newspapers
that
at
least
became
the
announced
view
of
the
old
world
and
so
the
time
passed
there
was
no
further
news
of
our
man
there
was
no
response
from
him
he
appeared
no
more
for
my
part
not
knowing
what
to
think
i
commenced
to
lose
all
hope
of
reaching
any
solution
to
the
strange
affair
then
on
the
morning
of
the
fifteenth
of
july
a
letter
without
postmark
was
found
in
the
mailbox
of
the
police
bureau
after
the
authorities
had
studied
it
it
was
given
out
to
the
washington
journals
which
published
it
in
facsimile
in
special
numbers
it
was
couched
as
follows
chapter
the
second
letter
on
board
the
terror
july
to
the
old
and
new
world
the
propositions
emanating
from
the
different
governments
of
europe
as
also
that
which
has
finally
been
made
by
the
united
states
of
america
need
expect
no
other
answer
than
this
i
refuse
absolutely
and
definitely
the
sums
offered
for
my
invention
my
machine
will
be
neither
french
nor
german
nor
austrian
nor
russian
nor
english
nor
american
the
invention
will
remain
my
own
and
i
shall
use
it
as
pleases
me
with
it
i
hold
control
of
the
entire
world
and
there
lies
no
force
within
the
reach
of
humanity
which
is
able
to
resist
me
under
any
circumstances
whatsoever
let
no
one
attempt
to
seize
or
stop
me
it
is
and
will
be
utterly
impossible
whatever
injury
anyone
attempts
against
me
i
will
return
a
hundredfold
as
to
the
money
which
is
offered
me
i
despise
it
i
have
no
need
of
it
moreover
on
the
day
when
it
pleases
me
to
have
millions
or
billions
i
have
but
to
reach
out
my
hand
and
take
them
let
both
the
old
and
the
new
world
realize
this
they
can
accomplish
nothing
against
me
i
can
accomplish
anything
against
them
i
sign
this
letter
the
master
of
the
world
chapter
outside
the
law
such
was
the
letter
addressed
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
to
the
person
who
had
placed
it
in
the
of
the
police
no
one
had
seen
him
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
our
offices
had
probably
not
been
once
vacant
during
the
entire
night
from
sunset
to
sunrise
there
had
always
been
people
busy
anxious
or
curious
passing
before
our
door
it
is
true
however
that
even
then
the
bearer
of
the
letter
might
easily
have
slipped
by
unseen
and
dropped
the
letter
in
the
box
the
night
had
been
so
dark
you
could
scarcely
see
from
one
side
of
the
street
to
the
other
i
have
said
that
this
letter
appeared
in
facsimile
in
all
the
newspapers
to
which
the
government
communicated
it
perhaps
one
would
naturally
imagine
that
the
first
comment
of
the
public
would
be
this
is
the
work
of
some
practical
joker
it
was
in
that
way
that
i
had
accepted
my
letter
from
the
great
eyrie
five
weeks
before
but
this
was
not
the
general
attitude
toward
the
present
letter
neither
in
washington
nor
in
the
rest
of
america
to
the
few
who
would
have
maintained
that
the
document
should
not
be
taken
seriously
an
immense
majority
would
have
responded
this
letter
has
not
the
style
nor
the
spirit
of
a
jester
only
one
man
could
have
written
it
and
that
is
the
inventor
of
this
unapproachable
machine
to
most
people
this
conclusion
seemed
indisputable
owing
to
a
curious
state
of
mind
easily
explainable
for
all
the
strange
facts
of
which
the
key
had
hitherto
been
lacking
this
letter
furnished
an
explanation
the
theory
now
almost
universally
accepted
was
as
follows
the
inventor
had
hidden
himself
for
a
time
only
in
order
to
reappear
more
startlingly
in
some
new
light
instead
of
having
perished
in
an
accident
he
had
concealed
himself
in
some
retreat
where
the
police
were
unable
to
discover
him
then
to
assert
positively
his
attitude
toward
all
governments
he
had
written
this
letter
but
instead
of
dropping
it
in
the
post
in
any
one
locality
which
might
have
resulted
in
its
being
traced
to
him
he
had
come
to
washington
and
deposited
it
himself
in
the
very
spot
suggested
by
the
government
official
notice
the
bureau
of
police
well
if
this
remarkable
personage
had
reckoned
that
this
new
proof
of
his
existence
would
make
some
noise
in
two
worlds
he
certainly
figured
rightly
that
day
the
millions
of
good
folk
who
read
and
their
daily
paper
could
to
employ
a
phrase
scarcely
believe
their
eyes
as
for
myself
i
studied
carefully
every
phrase
of
the
defiant
document
the
was
black
and
heavy
an
expert
at
chirography
would
doubtless
have
distinguished
in
the
lines
traces
of
a
violent
temperament
of
a
character
stern
and
unsocial
suddenly
a
cry
escaped
me
a
cry
that
fortunately
my
housekeeper
did
not
hear
why
had
i
not
noticed
sooner
the
resemblance
of
the
handwriting
to
that
of
the
letter
i
had
received
from
morganton
moreover
a
yet
more
significant
coincidence
the
initials
with
which
my
letter
had
been
signed
did
they
not
stand
for
the
words
master
of
the
world
and
whence
came
the
second
letter
on
board
the
doubtless
this
name
was
that
of
the
triple
machine
commanded
by
the
mysterious
captain
the
initials
in
my
letter
were
his
own
signature
and
it
was
he
who
had
threatened
me
if
i
dared
to
renew
my
attempt
on
the
great
eyrie
i
rose
and
took
from
my
desk
the
letter
of
june
thirteenth
i
compared
it
with
the
facsimile
in
the
newspapers
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
they
were
both
in
the
same
peculiar
my
mind
worked
eagerly
i
sought
to
trace
the
probable
deductions
from
this
striking
fact
known
only
to
myself
the
man
who
had
threatened
me
was
the
commander
of
this
terror
startling
name
only
too
well
justified
i
asked
myself
if
our
search
could
not
now
be
prosecuted
under
less
vague
conditions
could
we
not
now
start
our
men
upon
a
trail
which
would
lead
definitely
to
success
in
short
what
relation
existed
between
the
terror
and
the
great
eyrie
what
connection
was
there
between
the
phenomena
of
the
blueridge
mountains
arid
the
no
less
phenomenal
performances
of
the
fantastic
machine
i
knew
what
my
first
step
should
be
and
with
the
letter
in
my
pocket
i
hastened
to
police
headquarters
inquiring
if
ward
was
within
and
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
i
hastened
toward
his
door
and
rapped
upon
it
with
unusual
and
perhaps
unnecessary
vigor
upon
his
call
to
enter
i
stepped
eagerly
into
the
room
the
chief
had
spread
before
him
the
letter
published
in
the
papers
not
a
facsimile
but
the
original
itself
which
had
been
deposited
in
the
of
the
department
you
come
as
if
you
had
important
news
strock
judge
for
yourself
ward
and
i
drew
from
my
pocket
the
letter
with
the
initials
ward
took
it
glanced
at
its
face
and
asked
what
is
this
a
letter
signed
only
with
initials
as
you
can
see
and
where
was
it
posted
in
morganton
in
north
carolina
when
did
you
receive
it
a
month
ago
the
thirteenth
of
june
what
did
you
think
of
it
then
that
it
had
been
written
as
a
joke
and
now
strock
i
think
what
you
will
think
ward
after
you
have
studied
it
my
chief
turned
to
the
letter
again
and
read
it
carefully
it
is
signed
with
three
initials
said
he
yes
ward
and
those
initials
belong
to
the
words
of
the
world
in
this
facsimile
of
which
this
is
the
original
responded
ward
taking
it
up
it
is
quite
evident
i
urged
that
the
two
letters
are
by
the
same
hand
it
seems
so
you
see
what
threats
are
made
against
me
to
protect
the
great
eyrie
yes
the
threat
of
death
but
strock
you
have
had
this
letter
for
a
month
why
have
you
not
shown
it
to
me
before
because
i
attached
no
importance
to
it
today
after
the
letter
from
the
it
must
be
taken
seriously
i
agree
with
you
it
appears
to
me
most
important
i
even
hope
it
may
prove
the
means
of
tracking
this
strange
personage
that
is
what
i
also
hope
mr
ward
only
what
connection
can
possibly
exist
between
the
and
the
great
eyrie
that
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
even
imagine
there
can
be
but
one
explanation
continued
ward
though
it
is
almost
inadmissible
even
impossible
and
that
is
that
the
great
eyrie
was
the
spot
selected
by
the
inventor
where
he
gathered
his
material
that
is
impossible
cried
i
in
what
way
would
he
get
his
material
in
there
and
how
get
his
machine
out
after
what
i
have
seen
ward
your
suggestion
is
impossible
unless
strock
unless
what
i
demanded
unless
the
machine
of
this
master
of
the
world
has
also
wings
which
permit
it
to
take
refuge
in
the
great
eyrie
at
the
suggestion
that
the
terror
which
had
searched
the
deeps
of
the
sea
might
be
capable
also
of
rivaling
the
vultures
and
the
eagles
i
could
not
restrain
an
expressive
shrug
of
incredulity
neither
did
ward
himself
dwell
upon
the
extravagant
hypothesis
he
took
the
two
letters
and
compared
them
afresh
he
examined
them
under
a
microscope
especially
the
signatures
and
established
their
perfect
identity
not
only
the
same
hand
but
the
same
pen
had
written
them
after
some
moments
of
further
reflection
ward
said
i
will
keep
your
letter
strock
decidedly
i
think
that
you
are
fated
to
play
an
important
part
in
this
strange
affair
or
rather
in
these
two
affairs
what
thread
attaches
them
i
can
not
yet
see
but
i
am
sure
the
thread
exists
you
have
been
connected
with
the
first
and
it
will
not
be
surprising
if
you
have
a
large
part
in
the
second
i
hope
so
ward
you
know
how
inquisitive
i
am
i
do
strock
that
is
understood
now
i
can
only
repeat
my
former
order
hold
yourself
in
readiness
to
leave
washington
at
a
warning
all
that
day
the
public
excitement
caused
by
the
defiant
letter
mounted
steadily
higher
it
was
felt
both
at
the
white
house
and
at
the
capitol
that
public
opinion
absolutely
demanded
some
action
of
course
it
was
difficult
to
do
anything
where
could
one
find
this
master
of
the
world
and
even
if
he
were
discovered
how
could
he
be
captured
he
had
at
his
disposal
not
only
the
powers
he
had
displayed
but
apparently
still
greater
resources
as
yet
unknown
how
had
he
been
able
to
reach
lake
kirdall
over
the
rocks
and
how
had
he
escaped
from
it
then
if
he
had
indeed
appeared
on
lake
superior
how
had
he
covered
all
the
intervening
territory
unseen
what
a
bewildering
affair
it
was
altogether
this
of
course
made
it
all
the
more
important
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
since
the
millions
of
dollars
had
been
refused
force
must
be
employed
the
inventor
and
his
invention
were
not
to
be
bought
and
in
what
haughty
and
menacing
terms
he
had
couched
his
refusal
so
be
it
he
must
be
treated
as
an
enemy
of
society
against
whom
all
means
became
justified
that
he
might
be
deprived
of
his
power
to
injure
others
the
idea
that
he
had
perished
was
now
entirely
discarded
he
was
alive
very
much
alive
and
his
existence
constituted
a
perpetual
public
danger
influenced
by
these
ideas
the
government
issued
the
following
proclamation
since
the
commander
of
the
has
refused
to
make
public
his
invention
at
any
price
whatever
since
the
use
which
he
makes
of
his
machine
constitutes
a
public
menace
against
which
it
is
impossible
to
guard
the
said
commander
of
the
is
hereby
placed
beyond
the
protection
of
the
law
any
measures
taken
in
the
effort
to
capture
or
destroy
either
him
or
his
machine
will
be
approved
and
rewarded
it
was
a
declaration
of
war
war
to
the
death
against
this
master
of
the
world
who
thought
to
threaten
and
defy
an
entire
nation
the
american
nation
before
the
day
was
over
various
rewards
of
large
amounts
were
promised
to
anyone
who
revealed
the
hiding
place
of
this
dangerous
inventor
to
anyone
who
could
identify
him
and
to
anyone
who
should
rid
the
country
of
him
such
was
the
situation
during
the
last
fortnight
of
july
all
was
left
to
the
hazard
of
fortune
the
moment
the
outlaw
he
would
be
seen
and
signaled
and
when
the
chance
came
he
would
be
arrested
this
could
not
be
accomplished
when
he
was
in
his
automobile
on
land
or
in
his
boat
on
the
water
no
he
must
be
seized
suddenly
before
he
had
any
opportunity
to
escape
by
means
of
that
speed
which
no
other
machine
could
equal
i
was
therefore
all
alert
awaiting
an
order
from
ward
to
start
out
with
my
men
but
the
order
did
not
arrive
for
the
very
good
reason
that
the
man
whom
it
concerned
remained
undiscovered
the
end
of
july
approached
the
newspapers
continued
the
excitement
they
published
repeated
rumors
new
clues
were
constantly
being
announced
but
all
this
was
mere
idle
talk
telegrams
reached
the
police
bureau
from
every
part
of
america
each
contradicting
and
nullifying
the
others
the
enormous
rewards
offered
could
not
help
but
lead
to
accusations
errors
and
blunders
made
many
of
them
in
good
faith
one
time
it
would
be
a
cloud
of
dust
which
must
have
contained
the
automobile
at
another
time
almost
any
wave
on
any
of
thousand
lakes
represented
the
submarine
in
truth
in
the
excited
state
of
the
public
imagination
apparitions
assailed
us
from
every
side
at
last
on
the
of
july
i
received
a
telephone
message
to
come
to
ward
on
the
instant
twenty
minutes
later
i
was
in
his
cabinet
you
leave
in
an
hour
strock
said
he
where
for
for
toledo
it
has
been
seen
yes
at
toledo
you
will
get
your
final
orders
in
an
hour
my
men
and
i
will
be
on
the
way
good
and
strock
i
now
give
you
a
formal
order
what
is
it
mr
ward
to
succeed
this
time
to
succeed
chapter
the
campaign
so
the
undiscoverable
commander
had
reappeared
upon
the
territory
of
the
united
states
he
had
never
shown
himself
in
europe
either
on
the
roads
or
in
the
seas
he
had
not
crossed
the
atlantic
which
apparently
he
could
have
traversed
in
three
days
did
he
then
intend
to
make
only
america
the
scene
of
his
exploits
ought
we
to
conclude
from
this
that
he
was
an
american
let
me
insist
upon
this
point
it
seemed
clear
that
the
submarine
might
easily
have
crossed
the
vast
sea
which
separates
the
new
and
the
old
world
not
only
would
its
amazing
speed
have
made
its
voyage
short
in
comparison
to
that
of
the
swiftest
steamship
but
also
it
would
have
escaped
all
the
storms
that
make
the
voyage
dangerous
tempests
did
not
exist
for
it
it
had
but
to
abandon
the
surface
of
the
waves
and
it
could
find
absolute
calm
a
few
score
feet
beneath
but
the
inventor
had
not
crossed
the
atlantic
and
if
he
were
to
be
captured
now
it
would
probably
be
in
ohio
since
toledo
is
a
city
of
that
state
this
time
the
fact
of
the
machine
appearance
had
been
kept
secret
between
the
police
and
the
agent
who
had
warned
them
and
whom
i
was
hurrying
to
meet
no
journal
and
many
would
have
paid
high
for
the
chance
was
printing
this
news
we
had
decided
that
nothing
should
be
revealed
until
our
effort
was
at
an
end
no
indiscretion
would
be
committed
by
either
my
comrades
or
myself
the
man
to
whom
i
was
sent
with
an
order
from
ward
was
named
arthur
wells
he
awaited
us
at
toledo
the
city
of
toledo
stands
at
the
western
end
of
lake
erie
our
train
sped
during
the
night
across
west
virginia
and
ohio
there
was
no
delay
and
before
noon
the
next
day
the
locomotive
stopped
in
the
toledo
depot
john
hart
nab
walker
and
i
stepped
out
with
traveling
bags
in
our
hands
and
revolvers
in
our
pockets
perhaps
we
should
need
weapons
for
an
attack
or
even
to
defend
ourselves
scarcely
had
i
stepped
from
the
train
when
i
picked
out
the
man
who
awaited
us
he
was
scanning
the
arriving
passengers
impatiently
evidently
as
eager
and
full
of
haste
as
i
approached
him
mr
wells
said
i
mr
strock
asked
he
yes
i
am
at
your
command
said
wells
are
we
to
stop
any
time
in
toledo
i
asked
no
with
your
permission
strock
a
carriage
with
two
good
horses
is
waiting
outside
the
station
and
we
must
leave
at
once
to
reach
our
destination
as
soon
as
possible
we
will
go
at
once
i
answered
signing
to
my
two
men
to
follow
us
is
it
far
twenty
miles
and
the
place
is
called
black
rock
creek
having
left
our
bags
at
a
hotel
we
started
on
our
drive
much
to
my
surprise
i
found
there
were
provisions
sufficient
for
several
days
packed
beneath
the
seat
of
the
carriage
wells
told
me
that
the
region
around
black
rock
creek
was
among
the
wildest
in
the
state
there
was
nothing
there
to
attract
either
farmers
or
fishermen
we
would
find
not
an
inn
for
our
meals
nor
a
room
in
which
to
sleep
fortunately
during
the
july
heat
there
would
be
no
hardship
even
if
we
had
to
lie
one
or
two
nights
under
the
stars
more
probably
however
if
we
were
successful
the
matter
would
not
occupy
us
many
hours
either
the
commander
of
the
terror
would
be
surprised
before
he
had
a
chance
to
escape
or
he
would
take
to
flight
and
we
must
give
up
all
hope
of
arresting
him
i
found
arthur
wells
to
be
a
man
of
about
forty
large
and
powerful
i
knew
him
by
reputation
to
be
one
of
the
best
of
our
local
police
agents
cool
in
danger
and
enterprising
always
he
had
proven
his
daring
on
more
than
one
occasion
at
the
peril
of
his
life
he
had
been
in
toledo
on
a
wholly
different
mission
when
chance
had
thrown
him
on
the
track
of
the
terror
we
drove
rapidly
along
the
shore
of
lake
erie
toward
the
southwest
this
inland
sea
of
water
is
on
the
northern
boundary
of
the
united
states
lying
between
canada
on
one
side
and
the
states
of
ohio
pennsylvania
and
new
york
on
the
other
if
i
stop
to
mention
the
geographical
position
of
this
lake
its
depth
its
extent
and
the
waters
nearest
around
it
is
because
the
knowledge
is
necessary
for
the
understanding
of
the
events
which
were
about
to
happen
the
surface
of
lake
erie
covers
about
ten
thousand
square
miles
it
is
nearly
six
hundred
feet
above
sea
level
it
is
joined
on
the
northwest
by
means
of
the
detroit
river
with
the
still
greater
lakes
to
the
westward
and
receives
their
waters
it
has
also
rivers
of
its
own
though
of
less
importance
such
as
the
rocky
the
cuyahoga
and
the
black
the
lake
empties
at
its
northeastern
end
into
lake
ontario
by
means
of
niagara
river
and
its
celebrated
falls
the
greatest
known
depth
of
lake
erie
is
over
one
hundred
and
thirty
feet
hence
it
will
be
seen
that
the
mass
of
its
waters
is
considerable
in
short
this
is
a
region
of
most
magnificent
lakes
the
land
though
not
situated
far
northward
is
exposed
to
the
full
sweep
of
the
arctic
cold
the
region
to
the
northward
is
low
and
the
winds
of
winter
rush
down
with
extreme
violence
hence
lake
erie
is
sometimes
frozen
over
from
shore
to
shore
the
principal
cities
on
the
borders
of
this
great
lake
are
buffalo
at
the
east
which
belongs
to
new
york
state
and
toledo
in
ohio
at
the
west
with
cleveland
and
sandusky
both
ohio
cities
at
the
south
smaller
towns
and
villages
are
numerous
along
the
shore
the
traffic
is
naturally
large
its
annual
value
being
estimated
at
considerably
over
two
million
dollars
our
carriage
followed
a
rough
and
little
used
road
along
the
borders
of
the
lake
and
as
we
toiled
along
arthur
wells
told
me
what
he
had
learned
less
than
two
days
before
on
the
afternoon
of
july
wells
had
been
riding
on
horseback
toward
the
town
of
herly
five
miles
outside
the
town
he
was
riding
through
a
little
wood
when
he
saw
far
up
across
the
lake
a
submarine
which
rose
suddenly
above
the
waves
he
stopped
tied
his
horse
and
stole
on
foot
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
there
from
behind
a
tree
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
seen
this
submarine
advance
toward
him
and
stop
at
the
mouth
of
black
rock
creek
was
it
the
famous
machine
for
which
the
whole
world
was
seeking
which
thus
came
directly
to
his
feet
when
the
submarine
was
close
to
the
rocks
two
men
climbed
out
upon
its
deck
and
stepped
ashore
was
one
of
them
this
master
of
the
world
who
had
not
been
seen
since
he
was
reported
from
lake
superior
was
this
the
mysterious
terror
which
had
thus
risen
from
the
depths
of
lake
erie
i
was
alone
said
wells
alone
on
the
edge
of
the
creek
if
you
and
your
assistants
strock
had
been
there
we
four
against
two
we
would
have
been
able
to
reach
these
men
and
seize
them
before
they
could
have
regained
their
boat
and
fled
probably
i
answered
but
were
there
no
others
on
the
boat
with
them
still
if
we
had
seized
the
two
we
could
at
least
have
learned
who
they
were
and
above
all
added
wells
if
one
of
them
turned
out
to
be
the
captain
of
the
i
have
only
one
fear
wells
this
submarine
whether
it
is
the
one
we
seek
or
another
may
have
left
the
creek
since
your
departure
we
shall
know
about
that
in
a
few
hours
now
pray
heaven
they
are
still
there
then
when
night
comes
but
i
asked
did
you
remain
watching
in
the
wood
until
night
no
i
left
after
an
hour
watching
and
rode
straight
for
the
telegraph
station
at
toledo
i
reached
there
late
at
night
and
sent
immediate
word
to
washington
that
was
night
before
last
did
you
return
yesterday
to
black
rock
creek
yes
the
submarine
was
still
there
in
the
same
spot
and
the
two
men
the
same
two
men
i
judge
that
some
accident
had
happened
and
they
came
to
this
lonely
spot
to
repair
it
probably
so
said
i
some
damage
which
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
regain
their
usual
if
only
they
are
still
here
i
have
reason
to
believe
they
will
be
for
quite
a
lot
of
stuff
was
taken
out
of
the
boat
and
laid
about
upon
the
shore
and
as
well
as
i
could
discern
from
a
distance
they
seemed
to
be
working
on
board
only
the
two
men
only
the
two
but
protested
i
can
two
be
sufficient
to
handle
an
apparatus
of
such
speed
and
of
such
intricacy
as
to
be
at
once
automobile
boat
and
submarine
i
think
not
strock
but
i
only
saw
the
same
two
several
times
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
little
wood
where
i
was
hidden
and
gathered
sticks
for
a
fire
which
they
made
upon
the
beach
the
region
is
so
uninhabited
and
the
creek
so
hidden
from
the
lake
that
they
ran
little
danger
of
discovery
they
seemed
to
know
this
you
would
recognize
them
both
again
perfectly
one
was
of
middle
size
vigorous
and
quick
of
movement
heavily
bearded
the
other
was
smaller
but
stocky
and
strong
yesterday
as
before
i
left
the
wood
about
five
and
hurried
back
to
toledo
there
i
found
a
telegram
from
ward
notifying
me
of
your
coming
and
i
awaited
you
at
the
station
summed
up
then
the
news
amounted
to
this
for
forty
hours
past
a
submarine
presumably
the
one
we
sought
had
been
hidden
in
black
rock
creek
engaged
in
repairs
probably
these
were
absolutely
necessary
and
we
should
find
the
boat
still
there
as
to
how
the
terror
came
to
be
in
lake
erie
arthur
wells
and
i
discussed
that
and
agreed
that
it
was
a
very
probable
place
for
her
the
last
time
she
had
been
seen
was
on
lake
superior
from
there
to
lake
erie
the
machine
could
have
come
by
the
roads
of
michigan
but
since
no
one
had
remarked
its
passage
and
as
both
the
police
and
the
people
were
specially
aroused
and
active
in
that
portion
of
the
country
it
seemed
more
probable
that
the
terror
had
come
by
water
there
was
a
clear
route
through
the
chain
of
the
great
lakes
and
their
rivers
by
which
in
her
character
of
a
submarine
she
could
easily
proceed
undiscovered
and
now
if
the
terror
had
already
left
the
creek
or
if
she
escaped
when
we
attempted
to
seize
her
in
what
direction
would
she
turn
in
any
case
there
was
little
chance
o
following
her
there
were
two
at
the
port
of
buffalo
at
the
other
extremity
of
lake
erie
by
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
canada
there
are
no
vessels
of
war
whatever
on
the
great
lakes
these
might
however
have
been
little
launches
belonging
to
the
customs
service
before
i
left
washington
ward
had
informed
me
of
their
presence
and
a
telegram
to
their
commanders
would
if
there
were
need
start
them
in
pursuit
of
the
terror
but
despite
their
splendid
speed
how
could
they
vie
with
her
and
if
she
plunged
beneath
the
waters
they
would
be
helpless
moreover
arthur
wells
averred
that
in
case
of
a
battle
the
advantage
would
not
be
with
the
destroyers
despite
their
large
crews
and
many
guns
hence
if
we
did
not
succeed
this
night
the
campaign
would
end
in
failure
arthur
wells
knew
black
rock
creek
thoroughly
having
hunted
there
more
than
once
it
was
bordered
in
most
places
with
sharp
rocks
against
which
the
waters
of
the
lake
beat
heavily
its
channel
was
some
thirty
feet
deep
so
that
the
terror
could
take
shelter
either
upon
the
surface
or
under
water
in
two
or
three
places
the
steep
banks
gave
way
to
sand
beaches
which
led
to
little
gorges
reaching
up
toward
the
woods
two
or
three
hundred
feet
it
was
seven
in
the
evening
when
our
carriage
reached
these
woods
there
was
still
daylight
enough
for
us
to
see
easily
even
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
to
have
crossed
openly
to
the
edge
of
the
creek
would
have
exposed
us
to
the
view
of
the
men
of
the
terror
if
she
were
still
there
and
thus
give
her
warning
to
escape
had
we
better
stop
here
i
asked
wells
as
our
rig
drew
up
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
no
strock
said
he
we
had
better
leave
the
carriage
deeper
in
the
woods
where
there
will
be
no
chance
whatever
of
our
being
seen
can
the
carriage
drive
under
these
trees
it
can
declared
wells
i
have
already
explored
these
woods
thoroughly
five
or
six
hundred
feet
from
here
there
is
a
little
clearing
where
we
will
be
completely
hidden
and
where
our
horses
may
find
pasture
then
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
we
will
go
down
to
the
beach
at
the
edge
of
the
rocks
which
shut
in
the
mouth
of
the
creek
thus
if
the
is
still
there
we
shall
stand
between
her
and
escape
eager
as
we
all
were
for
action
it
was
evidently
best
to
do
as
wells
suggested
and
wait
for
night
the
intervening
time
could
well
be
occupied
as
he
said
leading
the
horses
by
the
bridle
while
they
dragged
the
empty
carriage
we
proceeded
through
the
heavy
woods
the
tall
pines
the
stalwart
oaks
the
cypress
scattered
here
and
there
made
the
evening
darker
overhead
beneath
our
feet
spread
a
carpet
of
scattered
herbs
pine
needles
and
dead
leaves
such
was
the
thickness
of
the
upper
foliage
that
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
could
no
longer
penetrate
here
we
had
to
feel
our
way
and
it
was
not
without
some
knocks
that
the
carriage
reached
the
clearing
ten
minutes
later
this
clearing
surrounded
by
great
trees
formed
a
sort
of
oval
covered
with
rich
grass
here
it
was
still
daylight
and
the
darkness
would
scarcely
deepen
for
over
an
hour
there
was
thus
time
to
arrange
an
encampment
and
to
rest
awhile
after
our
hard
trip
over
the
rough
and
rocky
roads
of
course
we
were
intensely
eager
to
approach
the
creek
and
see
if
the
terror
was
still
there
but
prudence
restrained
us
a
little
patience
and
the
enable
us
to
reach
a
commanding
position
unsuspected
wells
urged
this
strongly
and
despite
my
eagerness
i
felt
that
he
was
right
the
horses
were
unharnessed
and
left
to
browse
under
the
care
of
the
coachman
who
had
driven
us
the
provisions
were
unpacked
and
john
hart
and
nab
walker
spread
out
a
meal
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
a
superb
cypress
which
recalled
to
me
the
forest
odors
of
morganton
and
pleasant
garden
we
were
hungry
and
thirsty
and
food
and
drink
were
not
lacking
then
our
pipes
were
lighted
to
calm
the
anxious
moments
of
waiting
that
remained
silence
reigned
within
the
wood
the
last
song
of
the
birds
had
ceased
with
the
coming
of
night
the
breeze
fell
little
by
little
and
the
leaves
scarcely
quivered
even
at
the
tops
of
the
highest
branches
the
sky
darkened
rapidly
after
sundown
and
twilight
deepened
into
obscurity
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
eight
it
is
time
wells
when
you
will
mr
strock
then
let
us
start
we
cautioned
the
coachman
not
to
let
the
horses
stray
beyond
the
clearing
then
we
started
wells
went
in
advance
i
followed
him
and
john
hart
and
nab
walker
came
behind
in
the
darkness
we
three
would
have
been
helpless
without
the
guidance
of
wells
soon
we
reached
the
farther
border
of
the
woods
and
before
us
stretched
the
banks
of
black
rock
creek
all
was
silent
all
seemed
deserted
we
could
advance
without
risk
if
the
terror
was
there
she
had
cast
anchor
behind
the
rocks
but
was
she
there
that
was
the
momentous
question
as
we
approached
the
denouement
of
this
exciting
affair
my
heart
was
in
my
throat
wells
motioned
to
us
to
advance
the
sand
of
the
shore
crunched
beneath
our
steps
the
two
hundred
feet
between
us
and
the
mouth
of
the
creek
were
crossed
softly
and
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
bring
us
to
the
rocks
at
the
edge
of
the
lake
there
was
nothing
nothing
the
spot
where
wells
had
left
the
terror
hours
before
was
empty
the
master
of
the
world
was
no
longer
at
black
rock
creek
chapter
black
rock
creek
human
nature
is
prone
to
illusions
of
course
there
had
been
all
along
a
probability
that
the
terror
had
deserted
the
locality
even
admitting
that
it
was
she
wells
had
seen
the
previous
day
if
some
damage
to
her
triple
system
of
locomotion
had
prevented
her
from
regaining
either
by
land
or
by
water
her
usual
and
obliged
her
to
seek
refuge
in
black
rock
creek
what
ought
we
to
conclude
now
upon
finding
her
here
no
longer
obviously
that
having
finished
her
repairs
she
had
continued
on
her
way
and
was
already
far
beyond
the
waters
of
lake
erie
but
probable
as
this
result
had
been
from
the
first
we
had
more
and
more
ignored
it
as
our
trip
proceeded
we
had
come
to
accept
as
a
fact
that
we
should
meet
the
terror
that
we
should
find
her
anchored
at
the
base
of
the
rocks
where
wells
had
seen
her
and
now
what
disappointment
i
might
even
say
what
despair
all
our
efforts
gone
for
nothing
even
if
the
terror
was
still
upon
the
lake
to
find
her
reach
her
and
capture
her
was
beyond
our
power
and
it
might
as
well
be
fully
recognized
beyond
all
human
power
we
stood
there
wells
and
i
completely
crushed
while
john
hart
and
nab
walker
no
less
chagrined
went
tramping
along
the
banks
of
the
creek
seeking
any
trace
that
had
been
left
behind
posted
there
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
wells
and
i
exchanged
scarcely
a
word
what
need
was
there
of
words
to
enable
us
to
understand
each
other
after
our
eagerness
and
our
despair
we
were
now
exhausted
defeated
in
our
attempt
we
felt
as
unwilling
to
abandon
our
campaign
as
we
were
unable
to
continue
it
nearly
an
hour
slipped
by
we
could
not
resolve
to
leave
the
place
our
eyes
still
sought
to
pierce
the
night
sometimes
a
glimmer
due
to
the
sparkle
of
the
waters
trembled
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
then
it
vanished
and
with
it
the
foolish
hope
that
it
had
roused
sometimes
again
we
thought
we
saw
a
shadow
outlined
against
the
dark
the
silhouette
of
an
approaching
boat
yet
again
some
eddies
would
swirl
up
at
our
feet
as
if
the
creek
had
been
stirred
within
its
depths
these
vain
imaginings
were
dissipated
one
after
the
other
they
were
but
the
illusions
raised
by
our
strained
fancies
at
length
our
companions
rejoined
us
my
first
question
was
nothing
new
nothing
said
john
hart
you
have
explored
both
banks
of
the
creek
yes
responded
nab
walker
as
far
as
the
shallow
water
above
and
we
have
not
seen
even
a
vestige
of
the
things
which
wells
saw
laid
on
the
shore
let
us
wait
awhile
said
i
unable
to
resolve
upon
a
return
to
the
woods
at
that
moment
our
attention
was
caught
by
a
sudden
agitation
of
the
waters
which
swelled
upward
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
it
is
like
the
swell
from
a
vessel
said
wells
yes
said
i
instinctively
lowering
my
voice
what
has
caused
it
the
wind
has
completely
died
out
does
it
come
from
something
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
or
from
something
underneath
said
wells
bending
forward
the
better
to
determine
the
commotion
certainly
seemed
as
if
caused
by
some
boat
whether
from
beneath
the
water
or
approaching
the
creek
from
outside
upon
the
lake
silent
motionless
we
strained
eyes
and
ears
to
pierce
the
profound
obscurity
the
faint
noise
of
the
waves
of
the
lake
lapping
on
the
shore
beyond
the
creek
came
to
us
distinctly
through
the
night
john
hart
and
nab
walker
drew
a
little
aside
upon
a
higher
ridge
of
rocks
as
for
me
i
leaned
close
to
the
water
to
watch
the
agitation
it
did
not
lessen
on
the
contrary
it
became
momentarily
more
evident
and
i
began
to
distinguish
a
sort
of
regular
throbbing
like
that
produced
by
a
screw
in
motion
there
is
no
doubt
declared
wells
leaning
close
to
me
there
is
a
boat
coming
toward
us
there
certainly
is
responded
i
unless
they
have
whales
or
sharks
in
lake
erie
no
it
is
a
boat
repeated
wells
is
she
headed
toward
the
mouth
of
the
creek
or
is
she
going
further
up
it
this
is
just
where
you
saw
the
boat
twice
before
yes
just
here
then
if
this
is
the
same
one
and
it
can
be
no
other
she
will
probably
return
to
the
same
spot
there
whispered
wells
extending
his
hand
toward
the
entrance
of
the
creek
our
companions
rejoined
us
and
all
four
crouching
low
upon
the
bank
peered
in
the
direction
he
pointed
we
vaguely
distinguished
a
black
mass
moving
through
the
darkness
it
advanced
very
slowly
and
was
still
outside
the
creek
upon
the
lake
perhaps
a
cable
length
to
the
northeast
we
could
scarcely
hear
even
now
the
faint
throbbing
of
its
engines
perhaps
they
had
stopped
and
the
boat
was
only
gliding
forward
under
their
previous
impulse
it
seemed
then
that
this
was
indeed
the
submarine
which
wells
had
watched
and
it
was
returning
to
pass
this
night
like
the
last
within
the
shelter
of
the
creek
why
had
it
left
the
anchorage
if
only
to
return
had
it
suffered
some
new
disaster
which
again
impaired
its
power
or
had
it
been
before
compelled
to
leave
with
its
repairs
still
unfinished
what
cause
constrained
it
to
return
here
was
there
some
imperious
reason
why
it
could
no
longer
be
turned
into
an
automobile
and
go
darting
away
across
the
roads
of
ohio
to
all
these
questions
which
came
crowding
upon
me
i
could
give
no
answer
furthermore
both
wells
and
i
kept
reasoning
under
the
assumption
that
this
was
really
the
terror
commanded
by
the
master
of
the
world
who
had
dated
from
it
his
letter
of
defiance
to
the
government
yet
this
premise
was
still
unproven
no
matter
how
confident
we
might
feel
of
it
whatever
boat
this
was
that
stole
so
softly
through
the
night
it
continued
to
approach
us
assuredly
its
captain
must
know
perfectly
the
channels
and
shores
of
black
rock
creek
since
he
ventured
here
in
such
darkness
not
a
light
showed
upon
the
deck
not
a
single
ray
from
within
the
cabin
glimmered
through
any
crevice
a
moment
later
we
heard
some
machinery
moving
very
softly
the
swell
of
the
eddies
grew
stronger
and
in
a
few
moments
the
boat
touched
the
quay
this
word
quay
only
used
in
that
region
exactly
describes
the
spot
the
rocks
at
our
feet
formed
a
level
five
or
six
feet
above
the
water
and
descending
to
it
perpendicularly
exactly
like
a
landing
wharf
we
must
not
stop
here
whispered
wells
seizing
me
by
the
arm
no
i
answered
they
might
see
us
we
must
lie
crouched
upon
the
beach
or
we
might
hide
in
some
crevice
of
the
rocks
we
will
follow
you
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
the
dark
mass
was
now
close
at
hand
and
on
its
deck
but
slightly
raised
above
the
surface
of
the
water
we
could
trace
the
silhouettes
of
two
men
were
there
then
really
only
two
on
board
we
stole
softly
back
to
where
the
ravines
rose
toward
the
woods
above
several
niches
in
the
rocks
were
at
hand
wells
and
i
crouched
down
in
one
my
two
assistants
in
another
if
the
men
on
the
terror
landed
they
could
not
see
us
but
we
could
see
them
and
would
be
able
to
act
as
opportunity
offered
there
were
some
slight
noises
from
the
boat
a
few
words
exchanged
in
our
own
language
it
was
evident
that
the
vessel
was
preparing
to
anchor
then
almost
instantly
a
rope
was
thrown
out
exactly
on
the
point
of
the
quay
where
we
had
stood
leaning
forward
wells
could
discern
that
the
rope
was
seized
by
one
of
the
mariners
who
had
leaped
ashore
then
we
heard
a
scrape
along
the
ground
some
moments
later
steps
crunched
upon
the
sand
two
men
came
up
the
ravine
and
went
onward
toward
the
edge
of
the
woods
guiding
their
steps
by
a
ship
lantern
where
were
they
going
was
black
rock
creek
a
regular
hiding
place
of
the
terror
had
her
commander
a
depot
here
for
stores
or
provisions
did
they
come
here
to
restock
their
craft
when
the
whim
of
their
wild
voyaging
brought
them
to
this
part
of
the
continent
did
they
know
this
deserted
uninhabited
spot
so
well
that
they
had
no
fear
of
ever
being
discovered
here
what
shall
we
do
whispered
wells
wait
till
they
return
and
then
my
words
were
cut
short
by
a
surprise
the
men
were
not
thirty
feet
from
us
when
one
of
them
chancing
to
turn
suddenly
the
light
of
their
lantern
fell
full
upon
his
face
he
was
one
of
the
two
men
who
had
watched
before
my
house
in
long
street
i
could
not
be
mistaken
i
recognized
him
as
positively
as
my
old
servant
had
done
it
was
he
it
was
assuredly
one
of
the
spies
of
whom
i
had
never
been
able
to
find
any
further
traces
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
my
warning
letter
had
come
from
them
it
was
therefore
from
the
master
of
the
world
it
had
been
written
from
the
terror
and
this
was
the
terror
once
more
i
asked
myself
what
could
be
the
connection
between
this
machine
and
the
great
eyrie
in
whispered
words
i
told
wells
of
my
discovery
his
only
comment
was
it
is
all
incomprehensible
meanwhile
the
two
men
had
continued
on
their
way
to
the
woods
and
were
gathering
sticks
beneath
the
trees
what
if
they
discover
our
encampment
murmured
wells
no
danger
if
they
do
not
go
beyond
the
nearest
trees
but
if
they
do
discover
it
they
will
hurry
back
to
their
boat
and
we
shall
be
able
to
cut
off
their
retreat
toward
the
creek
where
their
craft
lay
there
was
no
further
sound
i
left
my
i
descended
the
ravine
to
the
quay
i
stood
on
the
very
spot
where
the
was
fast
among
the
rocks
the
terror
lay
there
quiet
at
the
end
of
its
cable
not
a
light
was
on
board
not
a
person
visible
either
on
the
deck
or
on
the
bank
was
not
this
my
opportunity
should
i
leap
on
board
and
there
await
the
return
of
the
two
men
mr
strock
it
was
wells
who
called
to
me
softly
from
close
at
hand
i
drew
back
in
all
haste
and
crouched
down
beside
him
was
it
too
late
to
take
possession
of
the
boat
or
would
the
attempt
perhaps
result
in
disaster
from
the
presence
of
others
watching
on
board
at
any
rate
the
two
men
with
the
lantern
were
close
at
hand
returning
down
the
ravine
plainly
they
suspected
nothing
each
carrying
a
bundle
of
wood
they
came
forward
and
stopped
upon
the
quay
then
one
of
them
raised
his
voice
though
not
loudly
hullo
captain
all
right
answered
a
voice
from
the
boat
wells
murmured
in
my
ear
there
are
three
perhaps
four
i
answered
perhaps
five
or
six
the
situation
grew
more
complicated
against
a
crew
so
numerous
what
ought
we
to
do
the
least
imprudence
might
cost
us
dear
now
that
the
two
men
had
returned
would
they
with
their
faggots
then
would
the
boat
leave
the
creek
or
would
it
remain
anchored
until
day
if
it
withdrew
would
it
not
be
lost
to
us
it
could
leave
the
waters
of
lake
erie
and
cross
any
of
the
neighboring
states
by
land
or
it
could
retrace
its
road
by
the
detroit
river
which
would
lead
it
to
lake
huron
and
the
great
lakes
above
would
such
an
opportunity
as
this
in
the
narrow
waters
of
black
rock
creek
ever
occur
again
at
least
said
i
to
wells
we
are
four
they
do
not
expect
attack
they
will
be
surprised
the
result
is
in
the
hands
of
providence
i
was
about
to
call
our
two
men
when
wells
again
seized
my
arm
listen
said
he
one
of
the
men
hailed
the
boat
and
it
drew
close
up
to
the
rocks
we
heard
the
captain
say
to
the
two
men
ashore
everything
is
all
right
up
there
everything
captain
there
are
still
two
bundles
of
wood
left
there
two
then
one
more
trip
will
bring
them
all
on
board
the
the
terror
it
was
she
yes
just
one
more
trip
answered
one
of
the
men
good
then
we
will
start
off
again
at
daybreak
were
there
then
but
three
of
them
on
board
the
captain
this
master
of
the
world
and
these
two
men
evidently
they
planned
to
take
aboard
the
last
of
their
wood
then
they
would
withdraw
within
their
machine
and
go
to
sleep
would
not
that
be
the
time
to
surprise
them
before
they
could
defend
themselves
rather
than
to
attempt
to
reach
and
capture
the
ship
in
face
of
this
resolute
captain
who
was
guarding
it
wells
and
i
agreed
that
it
was
better
to
let
his
men
return
unassailed
and
wait
till
they
were
all
asleep
it
was
now
half
an
hour
after
ten
steps
were
once
more
heard
upon
the
shore
the
man
with
a
lantern
and
his
companion
again
remounted
the
ravine
toward
the
woods
when
they
were
safely
beyond
hearing
wells
went
to
warn
our
men
while
i
stole
forward
again
to
the
very
edge
of
the
water
the
terror
lay
at
the
end
of
a
short
cable
as
well
as
i
could
judge
she
was
long
and
slim
shaped
like
a
spindle
without
chimney
without
masts
without
rigging
such
a
shape
as
had
been
described
when
she
was
seen
on
the
coast
of
new
england
i
returned
to
my
place
with
my
men
in
the
shelter
of
the
ravine
and
we
looked
to
our
revolvers
which
might
well
prove
of
service
five
minutes
had
passed
since
the
men
reached
the
woods
and
we
expected
their
return
at
any
moment
after
that
we
must
wait
at
least
an
hour
before
we
made
our
attack
so
that
both
the
captain
and
his
comrades
might
be
deep
in
sleep
it
was
important
that
they
should
have
not
a
moment
either
to
send
their
craft
darting
out
upon
the
waters
of
lake
erie
or
to
plunge
it
beneath
the
waves
where
we
would
have
been
entrapped
with
it
in
all
my
career
i
have
never
felt
such
impatience
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
two
men
must
have
been
detained
in
the
woods
something
had
barred
their
return
suddenly
a
loud
noise
was
heard
the
tumult
of
horses
galloping
furiously
along
the
shore
they
were
our
own
which
frightened
and
perhaps
neglected
by
the
driver
had
broken
away
from
the
clearing
and
now
came
rushing
along
the
bank
at
the
same
moment
the
two
men
reappeared
and
this
time
they
were
running
with
all
speed
doubtless
they
had
discovered
our
encampment
and
had
at
once
suspected
that
there
were
police
hidden
in
the
woods
they
realized
that
they
were
watched
they
were
followed
they
would
be
seized
so
they
dashed
recklessly
down
the
ravine
and
after
loosening
the
cable
they
would
doubtless
endeavor
to
leap
aboard
the
terror
would
disappear
with
the
speed
of
a
meteor
and
our
attempt
would
be
wholly
defeated
forward
i
cried
and
we
scrambled
down
the
sides
of
the
ravine
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
two
men
they
saw
us
and
on
the
instant
throwing
down
their
bundles
fired
at
us
with
revolvers
hitting
john
hart
in
the
leg
we
fired
in
our
turn
but
less
successfully
the
men
neither
fell
nor
faltered
in
their
course
reaching
the
edge
of
the
creek
without
stopping
to
unloose
the
cable
they
plunged
overboard
and
in
a
moment
were
clinging
to
the
deck
of
the
terror
their
captain
springing
forward
revolver
in
hand
fired
the
ball
grazed
wells
nab
walker
and
i
seizing
the
cable
pulled
the
black
mass
of
the
boat
toward
shore
could
they
cut
the
rope
in
time
to
escape
us
suddenly
the
was
torn
violently
from
the
rocks
one
of
its
hooks
caught
in
my
belt
while
walker
was
knocked
down
by
the
flying
cable
i
was
entangled
by
the
iron
and
the
rope
and
dragged
forward
the
terror
driven
by
all
the
power
of
her
engines
made
a
single
bound
and
darted
out
across
black
rock
creek
chapter
on
board
the
terror
when
i
came
to
my
senses
it
was
daylight
a
half
light
pierced
the
thick
glass
of
the
narrow
cabin
wherein
someone
had
placed
me
how
many
hours
ago
i
could
not
say
yet
it
seemed
to
me
by
the
slanting
rays
that
the
sun
could
not
be
very
far
above
the
horizon
i
was
resting
in
a
narrow
bunk
with
coverings
over
me
my
clothes
hanging
in
a
corner
had
been
dried
my
belt
torn
in
half
by
the
hook
of
the
iron
lay
on
the
floor
i
felt
no
wound
nor
injury
only
a
little
weakness
if
i
had
lost
consciousness
i
was
sure
it
had
not
been
from
a
blow
my
head
must
have
been
drawn
beneath
the
water
when
i
was
tangled
in
the
cable
i
should
have
been
suffocated
if
someone
had
not
dragged
me
from
the
lake
now
was
i
on
board
the
terror
and
was
i
alone
with
the
captain
and
his
two
men
this
seemed
probable
almost
certain
the
whole
scene
of
our
encounter
rose
before
my
eyes
hart
lying
wounded
upon
the
bank
wells
firing
shot
after
shot
walker
hurled
down
at
the
instant
when
the
grappling
hook
caught
my
belt
and
my
companions
on
their
side
must
not
they
think
that
i
had
perished
in
the
waters
of
lake
erie
where
was
the
terror
now
and
how
was
it
navigating
was
it
moving
as
an
automobile
speeding
across
the
roads
of
some
neighboring
state
if
so
and
if
i
had
been
unconscious
for
many
hours
the
machine
with
its
tremendous
powers
must
be
already
far
away
or
on
the
other
hand
were
we
as
a
submarine
following
some
course
beneath
the
lake
no
the
terror
was
moving
upon
some
broad
liquid
surface
the
sunlight
penetrating
my
cabin
showed
that
the
window
was
not
submerged
on
the
other
hand
i
felt
none
of
the
jolting
that
the
automobile
must
have
suffered
even
on
the
smoothest
highway
hence
the
terror
was
not
traveling
upon
land
as
to
deciding
whether
she
was
still
traversing
lake
erie
that
was
another
matter
had
not
the
captain
reascended
the
detroit
river
and
entered
lake
huron
or
even
lake
superior
beyond
it
was
difficult
to
say
at
any
rate
i
decided
to
go
up
on
deck
from
there
i
might
be
able
to
judge
dragging
myself
somewhat
heavily
from
the
bunk
i
reached
for
my
clothes
and
dressed
though
without
much
energy
was
i
not
probably
locked
within
this
cabin
the
only
exit
seemed
by
a
ladder
and
hatchway
above
my
head
the
hatch
rose
readily
to
my
hand
and
i
ascended
half
way
on
deck
my
first
care
was
to
look
forward
backward
and
on
both
sides
of
the
speeding
terror
everywhere
a
vast
expanse
of
waves
not
a
shore
in
sight
nothing
but
the
horizon
formed
by
sea
and
sky
whether
it
was
a
lake
or
the
ocean
i
could
easily
settle
as
we
shot
forward
at
such
speed
the
water
cut
by
the
bow
rose
furiously
upward
on
either
side
and
the
spray
lashed
savagely
against
me
i
tasted
it
it
was
fresh
water
and
very
probably
that
of
lake
erie
the
sun
was
but
midway
toward
the
zenith
so
it
could
scarcely
be
more
than
seven
or
eight
hours
since
the
moment
when
the
terror
had
darted
from
black
rock
creek
this
must
therefore
be
the
following
morning
that
of
the
of
july
considering
that
lake
erie
is
two
hundred
and
twenty
miles
long
and
over
fifty
wide
there
was
no
reason
to
be
surprised
that
i
could
see
no
land
neither
that
of
the
united
states
to
the
southeast
nor
of
canada
to
the
northwest
at
this
moment
there
were
two
men
on
the
deck
one
being
at
the
bow
on
the
the
other
in
the
stern
keeping
the
course
to
the
northeast
as
i
judged
by
the
position
of
the
sun
the
one
at
the
bow
was
he
whom
i
had
recognized
as
he
ascended
the
ravine
at
black
rock
the
second
was
his
companion
who
had
carried
the
lantern
i
looked
in
vain
for
the
one
whom
they
had
called
captain
he
was
not
in
sight
it
will
be
readily
appreciated
how
eager
was
my
desire
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
creator
of
this
prodigious
machines
of
this
fantastic
personage
who
occupied
and
preoccupied
the
attention
of
all
the
world
the
daring
inventor
who
did
not
fear
to
engage
in
battle
against
the
entire
human
race
and
who
proclaimed
himself
master
of
the
world
i
approached
the
man
on
the
and
after
a
minute
of
silence
i
asked
him
where
is
the
captain
he
looked
at
me
through
eyes
he
seemed
not
to
understand
me
yet
i
knew
having
heard
him
the
night
before
that
he
spoke
english
moreover
i
noticed
that
he
did
not
appear
surprised
to
see
me
out
of
my
cabin
turning
his
back
upon
me
he
continued
to
search
the
horizon
i
stepped
then
toward
the
stern
determined
to
ask
the
same
question
about
the
captain
but
when
i
approached
the
steersman
he
waved
me
away
with
his
hand
and
i
obtained
no
other
response
it
only
remained
for
me
to
study
this
craft
from
which
we
had
been
repelled
with
revolver
shots
when
we
had
seized
upon
its
anchor
rope
i
therefore
set
leisurely
to
work
to
examine
the
construction
of
this
machine
which
was
carrying
me
whither
the
deck
and
the
upper
works
were
all
made
of
some
metal
which
i
did
not
recognize
in
the
center
of
the
deck
a
scuttle
half
raised
covered
the
room
where
the
engines
were
working
regularly
and
almost
silently
as
i
had
seen
before
neither
masts
nor
rigging
not
even
a
flagstaff
at
the
stern
toward
the
bow
there
arose
the
top
of
a
periscope
by
which
the
terror
could
be
guided
when
beneath
the
water
on
the
sides
were
folded
back
two
sort
of
outshoots
resembling
the
gangways
on
certain
dutch
boats
of
these
i
could
not
understand
the
use
in
the
bow
there
rose
a
third
which
presumably
covered
the
quarters
occupied
by
the
two
men
when
the
terror
was
at
rest
at
the
stern
a
similar
hatch
gave
access
probably
to
the
cabin
of
the
captain
who
remained
unseen
when
these
different
hatches
were
shut
down
they
had
a
sort
of
rubber
covering
which
closed
them
hermetically
tight
so
that
the
water
could
not
reach
the
interior
when
the
boat
plunged
beneath
the
ocean
as
to
the
motor
which
imparted
such
prodigious
speed
to
the
machine
i
could
see
nothing
of
it
nor
of
the
propeller
however
the
fast
speeding
boat
left
behind
it
only
a
long
smooth
wake
the
extreme
fineness
of
the
lines
of
the
craft
caused
it
to
make
scarcely
any
waves
and
enabled
it
to
ride
lightly
over
the
crest
of
the
billows
even
in
a
rough
sea
as
was
already
known
the
power
by
which
the
machine
was
driven
was
neither
steam
nor
gasoline
nor
any
of
those
similar
liquids
so
well
known
by
their
odor
which
are
usually
employed
for
automobiles
and
submarines
no
doubt
the
power
here
used
was
electricity
generated
on
board
at
some
high
power
naturally
i
asked
myself
whence
comes
this
electricity
from
piles
or
from
accumulators
but
how
were
these
piles
or
accumulators
charged
unless
indeed
the
electricity
was
drawn
directly
from
the
surrounding
air
or
from
the
water
by
processes
hitherto
unknown
and
i
asked
myself
with
intense
eagerness
if
in
the
present
situation
i
might
be
able
to
discover
these
secrets
then
i
thought
of
my
companions
left
behind
on
the
shore
of
black
rock
creek
one
of
them
i
knew
was
wounded
perhaps
the
others
were
also
having
seen
me
dragged
overboard
by
the
hawser
could
they
possibly
suppose
that
i
had
been
rescued
by
the
terror
surely
not
doubtless
the
news
of
my
death
had
already
been
telegraphed
to
ward
from
toledo
and
now
who
would
dare
to
undertake
a
new
campaign
against
this
master
of
the
world
these
thoughts
occupied
my
mind
as
i
awaited
the
captain
appearance
on
the
deck
he
did
not
appear
i
soon
began
to
feel
very
hungry
for
i
must
have
fasted
now
nearly
hours
i
had
eaten
nothing
since
our
hasty
meal
in
the
woods
even
if
that
had
been
the
night
before
and
judging
by
the
pangs
which
now
assailed
my
stomach
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
had
not
been
snatched
on
board
the
terror
two
days
before
or
even
more
happily
the
question
if
they
meant
to
feed
me
and
how
they
meant
to
feed
me
was
solved
at
once
the
man
at
the
bow
left
his
post
descended
and
reappeared
then
without
saying
a
word
he
placed
some
food
before
me
and
returned
to
his
place
some
potted
meat
dried
fish
and
a
pot
of
ale
so
strong
that
i
had
to
mix
it
with
water
such
was
the
meal
to
which
i
did
full
justice
my
fellow
travelers
had
doubtless
eaten
before
i
came
out
of
the
cabin
and
they
did
not
join
me
there
was
nothing
further
to
attract
my
eyes
and
i
sank
again
into
thought
how
would
this
adventure
finish
would
i
see
this
invisible
captain
at
length
and
would
he
restore
me
to
liberty
could
i
regain
it
in
spite
of
him
that
would
depend
on
circumstances
but
if
the
terror
kept
thus
far
away
from
the
shore
or
if
she
traveled
beneath
the
water
how
could
i
escape
from
her
unless
we
landed
and
the
machine
became
an
automobile
must
i
not
abandon
all
hope
of
escape
moreover
why
should
i
not
admit
it
to
escape
without
having
learned
anything
of
the
terror
secrets
would
not
have
contented
me
at
all
although
i
could
not
thus
far
flatter
myself
upon
the
success
of
my
campaign
and
though
i
had
come
within
a
hairbreadth
of
losing
my
life
and
though
the
future
promised
far
more
of
evil
than
of
good
yet
after
all
a
step
forward
had
been
attained
to
be
sure
if
i
was
never
to
be
able
to
into
communication
with
the
world
if
like
this
master
of
the
world
who
had
voluntarily
placed
himself
outside
the
law
i
was
now
placed
outside
humanity
then
the
fact
that
i
had
reached
the
terror
would
have
little
value
the
craft
continued
headed
to
the
northeast
following
the
longer
axis
of
lake
erie
she
was
advancing
at
only
half
speed
for
had
she
been
doing
her
best
she
must
some
hours
before
have
reached
the
northeastern
extremity
of
the
lake
at
this
end
lake
erie
has
no
other
outlet
than
the
niagara
river
by
which
it
empties
into
lake
ontario
now
this
river
is
barred
by
the
famous
cataract
some
fifteen
miles
beyond
the
important
city
of
buffalo
since
the
terror
had
not
retreated
by
the
detroit
river
down
which
she
had
descended
from
the
upper
lakes
how
was
she
to
escape
from
these
waters
unless
indeed
she
crossed
by
land
the
sun
passed
the
meridian
the
day
was
beautiful
warm
but
not
unpleasantly
so
thanks
to
the
breeze
made
by
our
passage
the
shores
of
the
lake
continued
invisible
on
both
the
canadian
and
the
american
side
was
the
captain
determined
not
to
show
himself
had
he
some
reason
for
remaining
unknown
such
a
precaution
would
indicate
that
he
intended
to
set
me
at
liberty
in
the
evening
when
the
terror
could
approach
the
shore
unseen
toward
two
however
i
heard
a
slight
noise
the
central
hatchway
was
raised
the
man
i
had
so
impatiently
awaited
appeared
on
deck
i
must
admit
he
paid
no
more
attention
to
me
than
his
men
had
done
going
to
the
stern
he
took
the
helm
the
man
whom
he
had
relieved
after
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
left
the
deck
descending
by
the
forward
hatchway
the
captain
having
scanned
the
horizon
consulted
the
compass
and
slightly
altered
our
course
the
speed
of
the
terror
increased
this
man
so
interesting
both
to
me
and
to
the
world
must
have
been
some
years
over
fifty
he
was
of
middle
height
with
powerful
shoulders
still
very
erect
a
strong
head
with
thick
hair
rather
gray
than
white
smooth
shaven
cheeks
and
a
short
crisp
beard
his
chest
was
broad
his
jaw
prominent
and
he
had
that
characteristic
sign
of
tremendous
energy
bushy
eyebrows
drawn
sharply
together
assuredly
he
possessed
a
constitution
of
iron
splendid
health
and
warm
red
blood
beneath
his
sun
burned
skin
like
his
companions
the
captain
was
dressed
in
covered
by
an
coat
and
with
a
woolen
cap
which
could
be
pulled
down
to
cover
his
head
entirely
when
he
so
desired
need
i
add
that
the
captain
of
the
terror
was
the
other
of
the
two
men
who
had
watched
my
house
in
long
street
moreover
if
i
recognized
him
he
also
must
recognize
me
as
strock
to
whom
had
been
assigned
the
task
of
penetrating
the
great
eyrie
i
looked
at
him
curiously
on
his
part
while
he
did
not
seek
to
avoid
my
eyes
he
showed
at
least
a
singular
indifference
to
the
fact
that
he
had
a
stranger
on
board
as
i
watched
him
the
idea
came
to
me
a
suggestion
which
i
had
not
connected
with
the
first
view
of
him
in
washington
that
i
had
already
seen
this
characteristic
figure
was
it
in
one
of
the
photographs
held
in
the
police
department
or
was
it
merely
a
picture
in
some
shop
window
but
the
remembrance
was
very
vague
perhaps
i
merely
imagined
it
well
though
his
companions
had
not
had
the
politeness
to
answer
me
perhaps
he
would
be
more
courteous
he
spoke
the
same
language
as
i
although
i
could
not
feel
quite
positive
that
he
was
of
american
birth
he
might
indeed
have
decided
to
pretend
not
to
understand
me
so
as
to
avoid
all
discussion
while
he
held
me
prisoner
in
that
case
what
did
he
mean
to
do
with
me
did
he
intend
to
dispose
of
me
without
further
ceremony
was
he
only
waiting
for
night
to
throw
me
overboard
did
even
the
little
which
i
knew
of
him
make
me
a
danger
of
which
he
must
rid
himself
but
in
that
case
he
might
better
have
left
me
at
the
end
of
his
anchor
line
that
would
have
saved
him
the
necessity
of
drowning
me
over
again
i
turned
i
walked
to
the
stern
i
stopped
full
in
front
of
him
then
at
length
he
fixed
full
upon
me
a
glance
that
burned
like
a
flame
are
you
the
captain
i
asked
he
was
silent
this
boat
is
it
really
the
to
this
question
also
there
was
no
response
then
i
reached
toward
him
i
would
have
taken
hold
of
his
arm
he
repelled
me
without
violence
but
with
a
movement
that
suggested
tremendous
restrained
power
planting
myself
again
before
him
i
demanded
in
a
louder
tone
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
me
words
seemed
almost
ready
to
burst
from
his
lips
which
he
compressed
with
visible
irritation
as
though
to
check
his
speech
he
turned
his
head
aside
his
hand
touched
a
regulator
of
some
sort
and
the
machine
rapidly
increased
its
speed
anger
almost
mastered
me
i
wanted
to
cry
out
so
be
it
keep
your
silence
i
know
who
you
are
just
as
i
know
your
machine
recognized
at
madison
at
boston
at
lake
kirdall
yes
it
is
you
who
have
rushed
so
recklessly
over
our
roads
our
seas
and
our
lakes
your
boat
is
the
and
you
her
commander
wrote
that
letter
to
the
government
it
is
you
who
fancy
you
can
fight
the
entire
world
you
who
call
yourself
the
master
of
the
world
and
how
could
he
have
denied
it
i
saw
at
that
moment
the
famous
initials
inscribed
upon
the
helm
fortunately
i
restrained
myself
and
despairing
of
getting
any
response
to
my
questions
i
returned
to
my
seat
near
the
hatchway
of
my
cabin
for
long
hours
i
patiently
watched
the
horizon
in
the
hope
that
land
would
soon
appear
yes
i
sat
waiting
for
i
was
reduced
to
that
waiting
no
doubt
before
the
day
closed
the
terror
must
reach
the
end
of
lake
erie
since
she
continued
her
course
steadily
to
the
northeast
chapter
niagara
the
hours
passed
and
the
situation
did
not
change
the
steersman
returned
on
deck
and
the
captain
descending
watched
the
movement
of
the
engines
even
when
our
speed
increased
these
engines
continued
working
without
noise
and
with
remarkable
smoothness
there
was
never
one
of
those
inevitable
breaks
with
which
in
most
motors
the
pistons
sometimes
miss
a
stroke
i
concluded
that
the
terror
in
each
of
its
transformations
must
be
worked
by
rotary
engines
but
i
could
not
assure
myself
of
this
for
the
rest
our
direction
did
not
change
always
we
headed
toward
the
northeast
end
of
the
lake
and
hence
toward
buffalo
why
i
wondered
did
the
captain
persist
in
following
this
route
he
could
not
intend
to
stop
at
buffalo
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
boats
and
shipping
of
every
kind
if
he
meant
to
leave
the
lake
by
water
there
was
only
the
niagara
river
to
follow
and
its
falls
would
be
impassable
even
to
such
a
machine
as
this
the
only
escape
was
by
the
detroit
river
and
the
terror
was
constantly
leaving
that
farther
behind
then
another
idea
occurred
to
me
perhaps
the
captain
was
only
waiting
for
night
to
return
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
there
the
boat
changed
to
an
automobile
would
quickly
cross
the
neighboring
states
if
i
did
not
succeed
in
making
my
escape
during
this
passage
across
the
land
all
hope
of
regaining
my
liberty
would
be
gone
true
i
might
learn
where
this
master
of
the
world
hid
himself
i
might
learn
what
no
one
had
yet
been
able
to
discover
assuming
always
that
he
did
not
dispose
of
me
at
one
time
or
another
and
what
i
expected
his
disposal
would
be
is
easily
comprehended
i
knew
the
northeast
end
of
lake
erie
well
having
often
visited
that
section
of
new
york
state
which
extends
westward
from
albany
to
buffalo
three
years
before
a
police
mission
had
led
me
to
explore
carefully
the
shores
of
the
niagara
river
both
above
and
below
the
cataract
and
its
suspension
bridge
i
had
visited
the
two
principal
islands
between
buffalo
and
the
little
city
of
niagara
falls
i
had
explored
navy
island
and
also
goat
island
which
separates
the
american
falls
from
those
of
the
canadian
side
thus
if
an
opportunity
for
flight
presented
itself
i
should
not
find
myself
in
an
unknown
district
but
would
this
chance
offer
and
at
heart
did
i
desire
it
or
would
i
seize
upon
it
what
secrets
still
remained
in
this
affair
in
which
good
fortune
or
was
it
evil
fortune
had
so
closely
entangled
me
on
the
other
hand
i
saw
no
real
reason
to
suppose
that
there
was
any
chance
of
my
reaching
the
shores
of
the
niagara
river
the
terror
would
surely
not
venture
into
this
trap
which
had
no
exit
probably
she
would
not
even
go
to
the
extremity
of
the
lake
such
were
the
thoughts
that
spun
through
my
excited
brain
while
my
eyes
remained
fixed
upon
the
empty
horizon
and
always
one
persistent
question
remained
insolvable
why
had
the
captain
written
to
me
personally
that
threatening
letter
why
had
he
spied
upon
me
in
washington
what
bond
attached
him
to
the
great
eyrie
there
might
indeed
be
subterranean
canals
which
gave
him
passage
to
lake
kirdall
but
could
he
pierce
the
impenetrable
fortress
of
the
eyrie
no
that
was
beyond
him
toward
four
in
the
afternoon
reckoning
by
the
speed
of
the
terror
and
her
direction
i
knew
we
must
be
approaching
buffalo
and
indeed
its
outlines
began
to
show
some
fifteen
miles
ahead
during
our
passage
a
few
boats
had
been
seen
but
we
had
passed
them
at
a
long
distance
a
distance
which
our
captain
could
easily
keep
as
great
as
he
pleased
moreover
the
terror
lay
so
low
upon
the
water
that
at
even
a
mile
away
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
discover
her
now
however
the
hills
encircling
the
end
of
lake
erie
came
within
vision
beyond
buffalo
forming
the
sort
of
funnel
by
which
lake
erie
pours
its
waters
into
the
channel
of
the
niagara
river
some
dunes
rose
on
the
right
groups
of
trees
stood
out
here
and
there
in
the
distance
several
freight
steamers
and
fishing
smacks
appeared
the
sky
became
spotted
with
trails
of
smoke
which
were
swept
along
by
a
light
eastern
breeze
what
was
our
captain
thinking
of
in
still
heading
toward
the
port
of
buffalo
did
not
prudence
forbid
him
to
venture
further
at
each
moment
i
expected
that
he
would
give
a
sweep
of
the
helm
and
turn
away
toward
the
western
shore
of
the
lake
or
else
i
thought
he
would
prepare
to
plunge
beneath
the
surface
but
this
persistence
in
holding
our
bow
toward
buffalo
was
impossible
to
understand
at
length
the
helmsman
whose
eyes
were
watching
the
northeastern
shore
made
a
sign
to
his
companion
the
latter
leaving
the
bow
went
to
the
central
hatchway
and
descended
into
the
engine
room
almost
immediately
the
captain
came
on
deck
and
joining
the
helmsman
spoke
with
him
in
a
low
voice
the
latter
extending
his
hand
toward
buffalo
pointed
out
two
black
spots
which
showed
five
or
six
miles
distant
on
the
starboard
side
the
captain
studied
them
attentively
then
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
seated
himself
at
the
stern
without
altering
the
course
of
the
terror
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
i
could
see
plainly
that
there
were
two
smoke
clouds
at
the
point
they
had
studied
so
carefully
little
by
little
the
black
spots
beneath
these
became
more
defined
they
were
two
long
low
steamers
which
coming
from
the
port
of
buffalo
were
approaching
rapidly
suddenly
it
struck
me
that
these
were
the
two
torpedo
destroyers
of
which
ward
had
spoken
and
which
i
had
been
told
to
summon
in
case
of
need
these
destroyers
were
of
the
newest
type
the
swiftest
boats
yet
constructed
in
the
country
driven
by
powerful
engines
of
the
latest
make
they
had
covered
almost
thirty
miles
an
hour
it
is
true
the
terror
commanded
an
even
greater
speed
and
always
if
she
were
surrounded
so
that
flight
was
impossible
she
could
submerge
herself
out
of
reach
of
all
pursuit
in
truth
the
destroyers
would
have
had
to
be
submarines
to
attack
the
terror
with
any
chance
of
success
and
i
know
not
if
even
in
that
case
the
contest
would
have
been
equal
meanwhile
it
seemed
to
me
evident
that
the
commanders
of
the
two
ships
had
been
warned
perhaps
by
wells
who
returning
swiftly
to
toledo
might
have
telegraphed
to
them
the
news
of
our
defeat
it
appeared
moreover
that
they
had
seen
the
terror
for
they
were
headed
at
full
speed
toward
her
yet
our
captain
seemingly
giving
them
no
thought
whatever
continued
his
course
toward
the
niagara
river
what
would
the
torpedo
destroyers
do
presumably
they
would
maneuver
so
as
to
seek
to
shut
the
terror
within
the
narrowing
end
of
the
lake
where
the
niagara
offered
her
no
passage
our
captain
now
took
the
helm
one
of
the
men
was
at
the
bow
the
other
in
the
engine
room
would
the
order
be
given
for
me
to
go
down
into
the
cabin
it
was
not
to
my
extreme
satisfaction
to
speak
frankly
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
me
it
was
as
if
i
had
not
been
on
board
i
watched
therefore
not
without
mixed
emotions
the
approach
of
the
destroyers
less
than
two
miles
distant
now
they
separated
in
such
a
way
as
to
hold
the
terror
between
their
fires
as
to
the
master
of
the
world
his
manner
indicated
only
the
most
profound
disdain
he
seemed
sure
that
these
destroyers
were
powerless
against
him
with
a
touch
to
his
machinery
he
could
distance
them
no
matter
what
their
speed
with
a
few
turns
of
her
engine
the
terror
would
dart
beyond
their
cannon
shots
or
in
the
depths
of
the
lake
what
projectiles
could
find
the
submarine
five
minutes
later
scarcely
a
mile
separated
us
from
the
two
powerful
fighters
which
pursued
us
our
captain
permitted
them
to
approach
still
closer
then
he
pressed
upon
a
handle
the
terror
doubling
the
action
of
her
propellers
leaped
across
the
surface
of
the
lake
she
played
with
the
destroyers
instead
of
turning
in
flight
she
continued
her
forward
course
who
knew
if
she
would
not
even
have
the
audacity
to
pass
between
her
two
enemies
to
coax
them
after
her
until
the
hour
when
as
night
closed
in
they
would
be
forced
to
abandon
the
useless
pursuit
the
city
of
buffalo
was
now
in
plain
view
on
the
border
of
the
lake
i
saw
its
huge
buildings
its
church
towers
its
grain
elevators
only
four
or
five
miles
ahead
niagara
river
opened
to
the
northward
under
these
new
conditions
which
way
should
i
turn
when
we
passed
in
front
of
the
destroyers
or
perhaps
between
them
should
i
not
throw
myself
into
the
waters
i
was
a
good
swimmer
and
such
a
chance
might
never
occur
again
the
captain
could
not
stop
to
recapture
me
by
diving
could
i
not
easily
escape
even
from
a
bullet
i
should
surely
be
seen
by
one
or
other
of
the
pursuers
perhaps
even
their
commanders
had
been
warned
of
my
presence
on
board
the
terror
would
not
a
boat
be
sent
to
rescue
me
evidently
my
chance
of
success
would
be
even
greater
if
the
terror
entered
the
narrow
waters
of
niagara
river
at
navy
island
i
would
be
able
to
set
foot
on
territory
that
i
knew
well
but
to
suppose
that
our
captain
would
rush
into
this
river
where
he
might
be
swept
over
the
great
cataract
that
seemed
impossible
i
resolved
to
await
the
destroyers
closest
approach
and
at
the
last
moment
i
would
decide
yet
my
resolution
to
escape
was
but
i
could
not
resign
myself
thus
to
lose
all
chance
of
following
up
this
mystery
my
instincts
as
a
police
official
revolted
i
had
but
to
reach
out
my
hand
in
order
to
seize
this
man
who
had
been
outlawed
should
i
let
him
escape
me
no
i
would
not
save
myself
yet
on
the
other
hand
what
fate
awaited
me
and
where
would
i
be
carried
by
the
terror
if
i
remained
on
board
it
was
a
quarter
past
six
the
destroyers
quivering
and
trembling
under
the
strain
of
their
speed
gained
on
us
perceptibly
they
were
now
directly
astern
leaving
between
them
a
distance
of
twelve
or
fifteen
cable
lengths
the
terror
without
increasing
her
speed
saw
one
of
them
approach
on
the
port
side
the
other
to
starboard
i
did
not
leave
my
place
the
man
at
the
bow
was
close
by
me
immovable
at
the
helm
his
eyes
burning
beneath
his
contracted
brows
the
captain
waited
he
meant
perhaps
to
finish
the
chase
by
one
last
maneuver
suddenly
a
puff
of
smoke
rose
from
the
destroyer
on
our
left
a
projectile
brushing
the
surface
of
the
water
passed
in
front
of
the
terror
and
sped
beyond
the
destroyer
on
our
right
i
glanced
around
anxiously
standing
by
my
side
the
lookout
seemed
to
await
a
sign
from
the
captain
as
for
him
he
did
not
even
turn
his
head
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
expression
of
disdain
imprinted
on
his
visage
at
this
moment
i
was
pushed
suddenly
toward
the
hatchway
of
my
cabin
which
was
fastened
above
me
at
the
same
instant
the
other
hatchways
were
closed
the
deck
became
watertight
i
heard
a
single
throb
of
the
machinery
and
the
plunge
was
made
the
submarine
disappeared
beneath
the
waters
of
the
lake
cannon
shot
still
boomed
above
us
their
heavy
echo
reached
my
ear
then
everything
was
peace
only
a
faint
light
penetrated
through
the
porthole
into
my
cabin
the
submarine
without
the
least
rolling
or
pitching
sped
silently
through
the
deeps
i
had
seen
with
what
rapidity
and
also
with
what
ease
the
transformation
of
the
terror
had
been
made
no
less
easy
and
rapid
perhaps
would
be
her
change
to
an
automobile
and
now
what
would
this
master
of
the
world
do
presumably
he
would
change
his
course
unless
indeed
he
preferred
to
speed
to
land
and
there
continue
his
route
along
the
roads
it
still
seemed
more
probable
however
that
he
would
turn
back
toward
the
west
and
after
distancing
the
destroyers
regain
the
detroit
river
our
submersion
would
probably
only
last
long
enough
to
escape
out
of
cannon
range
or
until
night
forbade
pursuit
fate
however
had
decreed
a
different
ending
to
this
exciting
chase
scarce
ten
minutes
had
passed
when
there
seemed
some
confusion
on
board
i
heard
rapid
words
exchanged
in
the
engine
room
the
steadily
moving
machinery
became
noisy
and
irregular
at
once
i
suspected
that
some
accident
compelled
the
submarine
to
reascend
i
was
not
mistaken
in
a
moment
the
of
my
cabin
was
pierced
by
sunshine
the
terror
had
risen
above
water
i
heard
steps
on
the
deck
and
the
hatchways
were
including
mine
i
sprang
up
the
ladder
the
captain
had
resumed
his
place
at
the
helm
while
the
two
men
were
busy
below
i
looked
to
see
if
the
destroyers
were
still
in
view
yes
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
the
terror
had
already
been
seen
and
the
powerful
vessels
which
enforced
the
mandates
of
our
government
were
swinging
into
position
to
give
chase
once
more
the
terror
sped
in
the
direction
of
niagara
river
i
must
confess
i
could
make
nothing
of
this
maneuver
plunging
into
a
no
longer
able
to
seek
the
depths
because
of
the
accident
the
terror
might
indeed
temporarily
distance
her
pursuers
but
she
must
find
her
path
barred
by
them
when
she
attempted
to
return
did
she
intend
to
land
and
if
so
could
she
hope
to
outrun
the
telegrams
which
would
warn
every
police
agency
of
her
approach
we
were
now
not
half
a
mile
ahead
the
destroyers
pursued
us
at
top
speed
though
being
now
directly
behind
they
were
in
poor
position
for
using
their
guns
our
captain
seemed
content
to
keep
this
distance
though
it
would
have
been
easy
for
him
to
increase
it
and
then
at
nightfall
to
dodge
back
behind
the
enemy
already
buffalo
had
disappeared
on
our
right
and
a
little
after
seven
the
opening
of
the
niagara
river
appeared
ahead
if
he
entered
there
knowing
that
he
could
not
return
our
captain
must
have
lost
his
mind
and
in
truth
was
he
not
insane
this
man
who
proclaimed
himself
who
believed
himself
master
of
the
world
i
watched
him
there
calm
impassive
not
even
turning
his
head
to
note
the
progress
of
the
destroyers
and
i
wondered
at
him
this
end
of
the
lake
was
absolutely
deserted
freight
steamers
bound
for
the
towns
on
the
banks
of
the
upper
niagara
are
not
numerous
as
its
navigation
is
dangerous
not
one
was
in
sight
not
even
a
crossed
the
path
of
the
terror
even
the
two
destroyers
would
soon
be
obliged
to
pause
in
their
pursuit
if
we
continued
our
mad
rush
through
these
dangerous
waters
i
have
said
that
the
niagara
river
flows
between
new
york
and
canada
its
width
of
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
narrows
as
it
approaches
the
falls
its
length
from
lake
erie
to
lake
ontario
is
about
fifteen
leagues
it
flows
in
a
northerly
direction
until
it
empties
the
waters
of
lake
superior
michigan
huron
and
erie
into
ontario
the
last
lake
of
this
mighty
chain
the
celebrated
falls
which
occur
in
the
midst
of
this
great
river
have
a
height
of
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
they
are
called
sometimes
the
falls
because
they
curve
inward
like
the
iron
shoe
the
indians
have
given
them
the
name
of
thunder
of
waters
and
in
truth
a
mighty
thunder
roars
from
them
without
cessation
and
with
a
tumult
which
is
heard
for
several
miles
away
between
lake
erie
and
the
little
city
of
niagara
falls
two
islands
divide
the
current
of
the
river
navy
island
a
league
above
the
cataract
and
goat
island
which
separates
the
american
and
the
canadian
falls
indeed
on
the
lower
point
of
this
latter
isle
stood
once
that
terrapin
tower
so
daringly
built
in
the
midst
of
the
plunging
waters
on
the
very
edge
of
the
abyss
it
has
been
destroyed
for
the
constant
wearing
away
of
the
stone
beneath
the
cataract
makes
the
ledge
move
with
the
ages
slowly
up
the
river
and
the
tower
has
been
drawn
into
the
gulf
the
town
of
fort
erie
stands
on
the
canadian
shore
at
the
entrance
of
the
river
two
other
towns
are
set
along
the
banks
above
the
falls
schlosser
on
the
right
bank
and
chippewa
on
the
left
located
on
either
side
of
navy
island
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
current
bound
within
a
narrower
channel
begins
to
move
at
tremendous
speed
to
become
two
miles
further
on
the
celebrated
cataract
the
terror
had
already
passed
fort
erie
the
sun
in
the
west
touched
the
edge
of
the
canadian
horizon
and
the
moon
faintly
seen
rose
above
the
mists
of
the
south
darkness
would
not
envelop
us
for
another
hour
the
destroyers
with
huge
clouds
of
smoke
streaming
from
their
funnels
followed
us
a
mile
behind
they
sped
between
banks
green
with
shade
trees
and
dotted
with
cottages
which
lay
among
lovely
gardens
obviously
the
terror
could
no
longer
turn
back
the
destroyers
shut
her
in
completely
it
is
true
their
commanders
did
not
know
as
i
did
that
an
accident
to
her
machinery
had
forced
her
to
the
surface
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
escape
them
by
another
plunge
nevertheless
they
continued
to
follow
and
would
assuredly
maintain
their
pursuit
to
the
very
last
i
marveled
at
the
intrepidity
of
their
chase
through
these
dangerous
waters
i
marveled
still
more
at
the
conduct
of
our
captain
within
a
half
hour
now
his
course
would
be
barred
by
the
cataract
no
matter
how
perfect
his
machine
it
could
not
escape
the
power
of
the
great
falls
if
the
current
once
mastered
our
engines
we
should
inevitably
disappear
in
the
gulf
nearly
two
hundred
feet
deep
which
the
waters
have
dug
at
the
base
of
the
falls
perhaps
however
our
captain
had
still
power
to
turn
to
one
of
the
shores
and
flee
by
the
automobile
routes
in
the
midst
of
this
excitement
what
action
should
i
take
personally
should
i
attempt
to
gain
the
shores
of
navy
island
if
we
indeed
advanced
that
far
if
i
did
not
seize
this
chance
never
after
what
i
had
learned
of
his
secrets
never
would
the
master
of
the
world
restore
me
to
liberty
i
suspected
however
that
my
flight
was
no
longer
possible
if
i
was
not
confined
within
my
cabin
i
no
longer
remained
unwatched
while
the
captain
retained
his
place
at
the
helm
his
assistant
by
my
side
never
removed
his
eyes
from
me
at
the
first
movement
i
should
be
seized
and
locked
within
my
room
for
the
present
my
fate
was
evidently
bound
up
with
that
of
the
terror
the
distance
which
separated
us
from
the
two
destroyers
was
now
growing
rapidly
less
soon
they
were
but
a
few
away
could
the
motor
of
the
terror
since
the
accident
no
longer
hold
its
speeds
yet
the
captain
showed
not
the
least
anxiety
and
made
no
effort
to
reach
land
we
could
hear
the
hissing
of
the
steam
which
escaped
from
the
valves
of
the
destroyers
to
mingle
with
the
streamers
of
black
smoke
but
we
heard
even
more
plainly
the
roar
of
the
cataract
now
less
than
three
miles
away
the
terror
took
the
left
branch
of
the
river
in
passing
navy
island
at
this
point
she
was
within
easy
reach
of
the
shore
yet
she
shot
ahead
five
minutes
later
we
could
see
the
first
trees
of
goat
island
the
current
became
more
and
more
irresistible
if
the
terror
did
not
stop
the
destroyers
could
not
much
longer
follow
her
if
it
pleased
our
accursed
captain
to
plunge
us
into
the
vortex
of
the
falls
surely
they
did
not
mean
to
follow
into
the
abyss
indeed
at
this
moment
they
signaled
each
other
and
stopped
the
pursuit
they
were
scarce
more
than
six
hundred
feet
from
the
cataract
then
their
thunders
burst
on
the
air
and
several
cannon
shot
swept
over
the
terror
without
hitting
its
deck
the
sun
had
set
and
through
the
twilight
the
moon
rays
shone
upon
us
from
the
south
the
speed
of
our
craft
doubled
by
the
speed
of
the
current
was
prodigious
in
another
moment
we
should
plunge
into
that
black
hollow
which
forms
the
very
center
of
the
canadian
falls
with
an
eye
of
horror
i
saw
the
shores
of
goat
island
flashed
by
then
came
the
isles
of
the
three
sisters
drowned
in
the
spray
from
the
abyss
i
sprang
up
i
started
to
throw
myself
into
the
water
in
the
desperate
hope
of
gaining
this
last
refuge
one
of
the
men
seized
me
from
behind
suddenly
a
sharp
noise
was
heard
from
the
mechanism
which
throbbed
within
our
craft
the
long
gangways
folded
back
on
the
sides
of
the
machine
spread
out
like
wings
and
at
the
moment
when
the
terror
reached
the
very
edge
of
the
falls
she
arose
into
space
escaping
from
the
thundering
cataract
in
the
center
of
a
lunar
rainbow
chapter
the
eagle
nest
on
the
morrow
when
i
awoke
after
a
sound
sleep
our
vehicle
seemed
motionless
it
seemed
to
me
evident
that
we
were
not
running
upon
land
yet
neither
were
we
rushing
through
or
beneath
the
waters
nor
yet
soaring
across
the
sky
had
the
inventor
regained
that
mysterious
of
his
where
no
human
being
had
ever
set
foot
before
him
and
now
since
he
had
not
disembarrassed
himself
of
my
presence
was
his
secret
about
to
be
revealed
to
me
it
seemed
astonishing
that
i
had
slept
so
profoundly
during
most
of
our
voyage
through
the
air
it
puzzled
me
and
i
asked
if
this
sleep
had
not
been
caused
by
some
drug
mixed
with
my
last
meal
the
captain
of
the
terror
having
wished
thus
to
prevent
me
from
knowing
the
place
where
we
landed
all
that
i
can
recall
of
the
previous
night
is
the
terrible
impression
made
upon
me
by
that
moment
when
the
machine
instead
of
being
caught
in
the
vortex
of
the
cataract
rose
under
the
impulse
of
its
machinery
like
a
bird
with
its
huge
wings
beating
with
tremendous
power
so
this
machine
actually
fulfilled
a
use
it
was
at
the
same
time
automobile
boat
submarine
and
airship
earth
sea
and
air
it
could
move
through
all
three
elements
and
with
what
power
with
what
speed
al
few
instants
sufficed
to
complete
its
marvelous
transformations
the
same
engine
drove
it
along
all
its
courses
and
i
had
been
a
witness
of
its
metamorphoses
but
that
of
which
i
was
still
ignorant
and
which
i
could
perhaps
discover
was
the
source
of
the
energy
which
drove
the
machine
and
above
all
who
was
the
inspired
inventor
who
after
having
created
it
in
every
detail
guided
it
with
so
much
ability
and
audacity
at
the
moment
when
the
terror
rose
above
the
canadian
falls
i
was
held
down
against
the
hatchway
of
my
cabin
the
clear
moonlit
evening
had
permitted
me
to
note
the
direction
taken
by
the
it
followed
the
course
of
the
river
and
passed
the
suspension
bridge
three
miles
below
the
falls
it
is
here
that
the
irresistible
rapids
of
the
niagara
river
begin
where
the
river
bends
sharply
to
descend
toward
lake
ontario
on
leaving
this
point
i
was
sure
that
we
had
turned
toward
the
east
the
captain
continued
at
the
helm
i
had
not
addressed
a
word
to
him
what
good
would
it
do
he
would
not
have
answered
i
noted
that
the
terror
seemed
to
be
guided
in
its
course
through
the
air
with
surprising
ease
assuredly
the
roads
of
the
air
were
as
familiar
to
it
as
those
of
the
seas
and
of
the
lands
in
the
presence
of
such
results
could
one
not
understand
the
enormous
pride
of
this
man
who
proclaimed
himself
master
of
the
world
was
he
not
in
control
of
a
machine
infinitely
superior
to
any
that
had
ever
sprung
from
the
hand
of
man
and
against
which
men
were
powerless
in
truth
why
should
he
sell
this
marvel
why
should
he
accept
the
millions
offered
him
yes
i
comprehended
now
that
absolute
confidence
in
himself
which
was
expressed
in
his
every
attitude
and
where
might
not
his
ambition
carry
him
if
by
its
own
excess
it
mounted
some
day
into
madness
a
half
hour
after
the
terror
soared
into
the
air
i
had
sunk
into
complete
unconsciousness
without
realizing
its
approach
i
repeat
it
must
have
been
caused
by
some
drug
without
doubt
our
commander
did
not
wish
me
to
know
the
road
he
followed
hence
i
can
not
say
whether
the
aviator
continued
his
flight
through
space
or
whether
the
mariner
sailed
the
surface
of
some
sea
or
lake
or
the
chauffeur
sped
across
the
american
roads
no
recollection
remains
with
me
of
what
passed
during
that
night
of
july
now
what
was
to
follow
from
this
adventure
and
especially
concerning
myself
what
would
be
its
end
i
have
said
that
at
the
moment
when
i
awoke
from
my
strange
sleep
the
terror
seemed
to
me
completely
motionless
i
could
hardly
be
mistaken
whatever
had
been
her
method
of
progress
i
should
have
felt
some
movement
even
in
the
air
i
lay
in
my
berth
in
the
cabin
where
i
had
been
shut
in
without
knowing
it
just
as
i
had
been
on
the
preceding
night
which
i
had
passed
on
board
the
terror
on
lake
erie
my
business
now
was
to
learn
if
i
would
be
allowed
to
go
on
deck
here
where
the
machine
had
landed
i
attempted
to
raise
the
hatchway
it
was
fastened
ah
said
i
am
i
to
be
kept
here
until
the
recommences
its
travels
was
not
that
indeed
the
only
time
when
escape
was
hopeless
my
impatience
and
anxiety
may
be
appreciated
i
knew
not
how
long
this
halt
might
continue
i
had
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
wait
a
noise
of
bars
being
removed
came
to
my
ear
the
hatchway
was
raised
from
above
a
wave
of
light
and
air
penetrated
my
cabin
with
one
bound
i
reached
the
deck
my
eyes
in
an
instant
swept
round
the
horizon
the
terror
as
i
had
thought
rested
quiet
on
the
ground
she
was
in
the
midst
of
a
rocky
hollow
measuring
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
hundred
feet
in
circumference
a
floor
of
yellow
gravel
carpeted
its
entire
extent
unrelieved
by
a
single
tuft
of
herbage
this
hollow
formed
an
almost
regular
oval
with
its
longer
diameter
extending
north
and
south
as
to
the
what
was
its
height
what
the
character
of
its
crest
i
could
not
judge
above
us
was
gathered
a
fog
so
heavy
that
the
rays
of
the
sun
had
not
yet
pierced
it
heavy
trails
of
cloud
drifted
across
the
sandy
floor
doubtless
the
morning
was
still
young
and
this
mist
might
later
be
dissolved
it
was
quite
cold
here
although
this
was
the
first
day
of
august
i
concluded
therefore
that
we
must
be
far
in
the
north
or
else
high
above
we
must
still
be
somewhere
on
the
new
continent
though
where
it
was
impossible
to
surmise
yet
no
matter
how
rapid
our
flight
had
been
the
could
not
have
traversed
either
ocean
in
the
dozen
hours
since
our
departure
from
niagara
at
this
moment
i
saw
the
captain
come
from
an
opening
in
the
rocks
probably
a
grotto
at
the
base
of
this
cliff
hidden
in
the
fog
occasionally
in
the
mists
above
appeared
the
shadows
of
huge
birds
their
raucous
cries
were
the
sole
interruption
to
the
profound
silence
who
knows
if
they
were
not
affrighted
by
the
arrival
of
this
formidable
winged
monster
which
they
could
not
match
either
in
might
or
speed
everything
led
me
to
believe
that
it
was
here
that
the
master
of
the
world
withdrew
in
the
intervals
between
his
prodigious
journeys
here
was
the
garage
of
his
automobile
the
harbor
of
his
boat
the
hangar
of
his
and
now
the
terror
stood
motionless
at
the
bottom
of
this
hollow
at
last
i
could
examine
her
and
it
looked
as
if
her
owners
had
no
intention
of
preventing
me
the
truth
is
that
the
commander
seemed
to
take
no
more
notice
of
my
presence
than
before
his
two
companions
joined
him
and
the
three
did
not
hesitate
to
enter
together
into
the
grotto
i
had
seen
what
a
chance
to
study
the
machine
at
least
its
exterior
as
to
its
inner
parts
probably
i
should
never
get
beyond
conjecture
in
fact
except
for
that
of
my
cabin
the
hatchways
were
closed
and
it
would
be
vain
for
me
to
attempt
to
open
them
at
any
rate
it
might
be
more
interesting
to
find
out
what
kind
of
propeller
drove
the
terror
in
these
many
transformations
i
jumped
to
the
ground
and
found
i
was
left
at
leisure
to
proceed
with
this
first
examination
the
machine
was
as
i
have
said
the
bow
was
sharper
than
the
stern
the
body
was
of
aluminium
the
wings
of
a
substance
whose
nature
i
could
not
determine
the
body
rested
on
four
wheels
about
two
feet
in
diameter
these
had
pneumatic
tires
so
thick
as
to
assure
ease
of
movement
at
any
speed
their
spokes
spread
out
like
paddles
or
battledores
and
when
the
terror
moved
either
on
or
under
the
water
they
must
have
increased
her
pace
these
wheels
were
not
however
the
principal
propeller
this
consisted
of
two
parsons
turbines
placed
on
either
side
of
the
keel
driven
with
extreme
rapidity
by
the
engine
they
urged
the
boat
onward
in
the
water
by
twin
screws
and
i
even
questioned
if
they
were
not
powerful
enough
to
propel
the
machine
through
the
air
the
chief
aerial
support
however
was
that
of
the
great
wings
now
again
in
repose
and
folded
back
along
the
sides
thus
the
theory
of
the
heavier
than
air
flying
machine
was
employed
by
the
inventor
a
system
which
enabled
him
to
dart
through
space
with
a
speed
probably
superior
to
that
of
the
largest
birds
as
to
the
agent
which
set
in
action
these
various
mechanisms
i
repeat
it
was
it
could
be
no
other
than
electricity
but
from
what
source
did
his
batteries
get
their
power
had
he
somewhere
an
electric
factory
to
which
he
must
return
were
the
dynamos
perhaps
working
in
one
of
the
caverns
of
this
hollow
the
result
of
my
examination
was
that
while
i
could
see
that
the
machine
used
wheels
and
turbine
screws
and
wings
i
knew
nothing
of
either
its
engine
nor
of
the
force
which
drove
it
to
be
sure
the
discovery
of
this
secret
would
be
of
little
value
to
me
to
employ
it
i
must
first
be
free
and
after
what
i
knew
little
as
that
really
was
the
master
of
the
world
would
never
release
me
there
remained
it
is
true
the
chance
of
escape
but
would
an
opportunity
ever
present
itself
if
there
could
be
none
during
the
voyages
of
the
terror
might
there
possibly
be
while
we
remained
in
this
retreat
the
first
question
to
be
solved
was
the
location
of
this
hollow
what
communication
did
it
have
with
the
surrounding
region
could
one
only
depart
from
it
by
a
and
in
what
part
of
the
united
states
were
we
was
it
not
reasonable
to
estimate
that
our
flight
through
the
darkness
had
covered
several
hundred
leagues
there
was
one
very
natural
hypothesis
which
deserved
to
be
considered
if
not
actually
accepted
what
more
natural
harbor
could
there
be
for
the
terror
than
the
great
eyrie
was
it
too
difficult
a
flight
for
our
aviator
to
reach
the
summit
could
he
not
soar
anywhere
that
the
vultures
and
the
eagles
could
did
not
that
inaccessible
eyrie
offer
to
the
master
of
the
world
just
such
a
retreat
as
our
police
had
been
unable
to
discover
one
in
which
he
might
well
believe
himself
safe
from
all
attacks
moreover
the
distance
between
niagara
falls
and
this
part
of
the
blueridge
mountains
did
not
exceed
four
hundred
and
fifty
miles
a
flight
which
would
have
been
easy
for
the
terror
yes
this
idea
more
and
more
took
possession
of
me
it
crowded
out
a
hundred
other
unsupported
suggestions
did
not
this
explain
the
nature
of
the
bond
which
existed
between
the
great
eyrie
and
the
letter
which
i
had
received
with
our
commander
initials
and
the
threats
against
me
if
i
renewed
the
ascent
and
the
espionage
to
which
i
had
been
subjected
and
all
the
phenomena
of
which
the
great
eyrie
had
been
the
theater
were
they
not
to
be
attributed
to
this
same
cause
though
what
lay
behind
the
phenomena
was
not
yet
clear
yes
the
great
eyrie
the
great
eyrie
but
since
it
had
been
impossible
for
me
to
penetrate
here
would
it
not
be
equally
impossible
for
me
to
get
out
again
except
upon
the
terror
ah
if
the
mists
would
but
lift
perhaps
i
should
recognize
the
place
what
was
as
yet
a
mere
hypothesis
would
become
a
starting
point
to
act
upon
however
since
i
had
freedom
to
move
about
since
neither
the
captain
nor
his
men
paid
any
heed
to
me
i
resolved
to
explore
the
hollow
the
three
of
them
were
all
in
the
grotto
toward
the
north
end
of
the
oval
therefore
i
would
commence
my
inspection
at
the
southern
end
reaching
the
rocky
wall
i
skirted
along
its
base
and
found
it
broken
by
many
crevices
above
arose
more
solid
rocks
of
that
feldspar
of
which
the
chain
of
the
alleghanies
largely
consists
to
what
height
the
rock
wall
rose
or
what
was
the
character
of
its
summit
was
still
impossible
to
see
i
must
wait
until
the
sun
had
scattered
the
mists
in
the
meantime
i
continued
to
follow
along
the
base
of
the
cliff
none
of
its
cavities
seemed
to
extend
inward
to
any
distance
several
of
them
contained
debris
from
the
hand
of
man
bits
of
broken
wood
heaps
of
dried
grasses
on
the
ground
were
still
to
be
seen
the
footprints
that
the
captain
and
his
men
must
have
left
perhaps
months
before
upon
the
sand
my
jailers
being
doubtless
very
busy
in
their
cabin
did
not
show
themselves
until
they
had
arranged
and
packed
several
large
bundles
did
they
purpose
to
carry
those
on
board
the
terror
and
were
they
packing
up
with
the
intention
of
permanently
leaving
their
retreat
in
half
an
hour
my
explorations
were
completed
and
i
returned
toward
the
center
here
and
there
were
heaped
up
piles
of
ashes
bleached
by
weather
there
were
fragments
of
burned
planks
and
beams
posts
to
which
clung
rusted
armatures
of
metal
twisted
by
fire
all
the
remnants
of
some
intricate
mechanism
destroyed
by
the
flames
clearly
at
some
period
not
very
remote
the
hollow
had
been
the
scene
of
a
conflagration
accidental
or
intentional
naturally
i
connected
this
with
the
phenomena
observed
at
the
great
eyrie
the
flames
which
rose
above
the
crest
the
noises
which
had
so
frightened
the
people
of
pleasant
garden
and
morganton
but
of
what
mechanisms
were
these
the
fragments
and
what
reason
had
our
captain
for
destroying
them
at
this
moment
i
felt
a
breath
of
air
a
breeze
came
from
the
east
the
sky
swiftly
cleared
the
hollow
was
filled
with
light
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
which
appeared
midway
between
the
horizon
and
the
zenith
a
cry
escaped
me
the
crest
of
the
rocky
wall
rose
a
hundred
feet
above
me
and
on
the
eastern
side
was
revealed
that
easily
recognizable
pinnacle
the
rock
like
a
mounting
eagle
it
was
the
same
that
had
held
the
attention
of
elias
smith
and
myself
when
we
had
looked
up
at
it
from
the
outer
side
of
the
great
eyrie
thus
there
was
no
further
doubt
in
its
flight
during
the
night
the
airship
had
covered
the
distance
between
lake
erie
and
north
carolina
it
was
in
the
depth
of
this
eyrie
that
the
machine
had
found
shelter
this
was
the
nest
worthy
of
the
gigantic
and
powerful
bird
created
by
the
genius
of
our
captain
the
fortress
whose
mighty
walls
none
but
he
could
scale
perhaps
even
he
had
discovered
in
the
depths
of
some
cavern
some
subterranean
passage
by
which
he
himself
could
quit
the
great
eyrie
leaving
the
terror
safely
sheltered
within
at
last
i
saw
it
all
this
explained
the
first
letter
sent
me
from
the
great
eyrie
itself
with
the
threat
of
death
if
we
had
been
able
to
penetrate
into
this
hollow
who
knows
if
the
secrets
of
the
master
of
the
world
might
not
have
been
discovered
before
he
had
been
able
to
set
them
beyond
our
reach
i
stood
there
motionless
my
eyes
fixed
on
that
mounting
eagle
of
stone
prey
to
a
sudden
violent
emotion
whatsoever
might
be
the
consequences
to
myself
was
it
not
my
duty
to
destroy
this
machine
here
and
now
before
it
could
resume
its
menacing
flight
of
mastery
across
the
world
steps
approached
behind
me
i
turned
the
inventor
stood
by
my
side
and
pausing
looked
me
in
the
face
i
was
unable
to
restrain
myself
the
words
burst
forth
the
great
eyrie
the
great
eyrie
yes
inspector
strock
and
you
you
are
the
master
of
the
world
of
that
world
to
which
i
have
already
proved
myself
to
be
the
most
powerful
of
men
you
i
reiterated
stupefied
with
amazement
i
responded
he
drawing
himself
up
in
all
his
pride
i
robur
robur
the
conqueror
chapter
robur
the
conqueror
robur
the
conqueror
this
then
was
the
likeness
i
had
vaguely
recalled
some
years
before
the
portrait
of
this
extraordinary
man
had
been
printed
in
all
the
american
newspapers
under
date
of
the
thirteenth
of
june
the
day
after
this
personage
had
made
his
sensational
appearance
at
the
meeting
of
the
weldon
institute
at
philadelphia
i
had
noted
the
striking
character
of
the
portrait
at
the
time
the
square
shoulders
the
back
like
a
regular
trapezoid
its
longer
side
formed
by
that
geometrical
shoulder
line
the
robust
neck
the
enormous
spheroidal
head
the
eyes
at
the
least
emotion
burned
with
fire
while
above
them
were
the
heavy
permanently
contracted
brows
which
signified
such
energy
the
hair
was
short
and
crisp
with
a
glitter
as
of
metal
in
its
lights
the
huge
breast
rose
and
fell
like
a
blacksmith
forge
and
the
thighs
the
arms
and
hands
were
worthy
of
the
mighty
body
the
narrow
beard
was
the
same
also
with
the
smooth
shaven
cheeks
which
showed
the
powerful
muscles
of
the
jaw
and
this
was
robur
the
conqueror
who
now
stood
before
me
who
revealed
himself
to
me
hurling
forth
his
name
like
a
threat
within
his
own
impenetrable
fortress
let
me
recall
briefly
the
facts
which
had
previously
drawn
upon
robur
the
conqueror
the
attention
of
the
entire
world
the
weldon
institute
was
a
club
devoted
to
aeronautics
under
the
presidency
of
one
of
the
chief
personages
of
philadelphia
commonly
called
uncle
prudent
its
secretary
was
phillip
evans
the
members
of
the
institute
were
devoted
to
the
theory
of
the
lighter
than
air
machine
and
under
their
two
leaders
were
constructing
an
enormous
dirigible
balloon
the
at
a
meeting
in
which
they
were
discussing
the
details
of
the
construction
of
their
balloon
this
unknown
robur
had
suddenly
appeared
and
ridiculing
all
their
plans
had
insisted
that
the
only
true
solution
of
flight
lay
with
the
heavier
than
air
machines
and
that
he
had
proven
this
by
constructing
one
he
was
in
this
turn
doubted
and
ridiculed
by
the
members
of
the
club
who
called
him
in
mockery
robur
the
conqueror
in
the
tumult
that
followed
revolver
shots
were
fired
and
the
intruder
disappeared
that
same
night
he
had
by
force
abducted
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
the
club
and
had
taken
them
much
against
their
will
upon
a
voyage
in
the
wonderful
the
albatross
which
he
had
constructed
he
meant
thus
to
prove
to
them
beyond
argument
the
correctness
of
his
assertions
this
ship
a
hundred
feet
long
was
upheld
in
the
air
by
a
large
number
of
horizontal
screws
and
was
driven
forward
by
vertical
screws
at
its
bow
and
stern
it
was
managed
by
a
crew
of
at
least
half
a
dozen
men
who
seemed
absolutely
devoted
to
their
leader
robur
after
a
voyage
almost
completely
around
the
world
mr
prudent
and
evans
managed
to
escape
from
the
albatross
after
a
desperate
struggle
they
even
managed
to
cause
an
explosion
on
the
airship
destroying
it
and
involving
the
inventor
and
all
his
crew
in
a
terrific
fall
from
the
sky
into
the
pacific
ocean
mr
prudent
and
evans
then
returned
to
philadelphia
they
had
learned
that
the
albatross
had
been
constructed
on
an
unknown
isle
of
the
pacific
called
island
x
but
since
the
location
of
this
was
wholly
unknown
its
discovery
lay
scarcely
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
moreover
the
search
seemed
entirely
unnecessary
as
the
vengeful
prisoners
were
quite
certain
that
they
had
destroyed
their
jailers
hence
the
two
millionaires
restored
to
their
homes
went
calmly
on
with
the
construction
of
their
own
machine
the
they
hoped
by
means
of
it
to
soar
once
more
into
the
regions
they
had
traversed
with
robur
and
to
prove
to
themselves
that
their
lighter
than
air
machine
was
at
least
the
equal
of
the
heavy
albatross
if
they
had
not
persisted
they
would
not
have
been
true
americans
on
the
twentieth
of
april
in
the
following
year
the
was
finished
and
the
ascent
was
made
from
fairmount
park
in
philadelphia
i
myself
was
there
with
thousands
of
other
spectators
we
saw
the
huge
balloon
rise
gracefully
and
thanks
to
its
powerful
screws
it
maneuvered
in
every
direction
with
surprising
ease
suddenly
a
cry
was
heard
a
cry
repeated
from
a
thousand
throats
another
airship
had
appeared
in
the
distant
skies
and
it
now
approached
with
marvelous
rapidity
it
was
another
albatross
perhaps
even
superior
to
the
first
robur
and
his
men
had
escaped
death
in
the
pacific
and
burning
for
revenge
they
had
constructed
a
second
airship
in
their
secret
island
x
like
a
gigantic
bird
of
prey
the
albatross
hurled
itself
upon
the
doubtless
robur
while
avenging
himself
wished
also
to
prove
the
immeasurable
superiority
of
the
heavier
than
air
machines
mr
prudent
and
evans
defended
themselves
as
best
they
could
knowing
that
their
balloon
had
nothing
like
the
horizontal
speed
of
the
albatross
they
attempted
to
take
advantage
of
their
superior
lightness
and
rise
above
her
the
throwing
out
all
her
ballast
soared
to
a
height
of
over
twenty
thousand
feet
yet
even
there
the
albatross
rose
above
her
and
circled
round
her
with
ease
suddenly
an
explosion
was
heard
the
enormous
of
the
expanding
under
the
dilation
of
its
contents
at
this
great
height
had
finally
burst
the
balloon
fell
rapidly
then
to
our
universal
astonishment
the
albatross
shot
down
after
her
rival
not
to
finish
the
work
of
destruction
but
to
bring
rescue
yes
robur
forgetting
his
vengeance
rejoined
the
sinking
and
his
men
lifted
mr
prudent
evans
and
the
aeronaut
who
accompanied
them
onto
the
platform
of
his
craft
then
the
balloon
being
at
length
entirely
empty
fell
to
its
destruction
among
the
trees
of
fairmount
park
the
public
was
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
with
fear
now
that
robur
had
recaptured
his
prisoners
how
would
he
avenge
himself
would
they
be
carried
away
this
time
forever
the
albatross
continued
to
descend
as
if
to
land
in
the
clearing
at
fairmount
park
but
if
it
came
within
reach
would
not
the
infuriated
crowd
throw
themselves
upon
the
airship
tearing
both
it
and
its
inventor
to
pieces
the
albatross
descended
within
six
feet
of
the
ground
i
remember
well
the
general
movement
forward
with
which
the
crowd
threatened
to
attack
it
then
robur
voice
rang
out
in
words
which
even
now
i
can
repeat
almost
as
he
said
them
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
are
again
in
my
power
in
holding
them
prisoners
i
would
but
be
exercising
my
natural
right
of
reprisal
for
the
injuries
they
have
done
me
but
the
passion
and
resentment
which
have
been
roused
both
in
them
and
you
by
the
success
of
the
show
that
the
souls
of
men
are
not
yet
ready
for
the
vast
increase
of
power
which
the
conquest
of
the
air
will
bring
to
them
uncle
prudent
phillip
evans
you
are
free
the
three
men
rescued
from
the
balloon
leaped
to
the
ground
the
airship
rose
some
thirty
feet
out
of
reach
and
robur
recommenced
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
conquest
of
the
air
is
made
but
it
shall
not
be
given
into
your
hands
until
the
proper
time
i
leave
and
i
carry
my
secret
with
me
it
will
not
be
lost
to
humanity
but
shall
be
entrusted
to
them
when
they
have
learned
not
to
abuse
it
farewell
citizens
of
the
united
states
then
the
albatross
rose
under
the
impulse
of
its
mighty
screws
and
sped
away
amidst
the
hurrahs
of
the
multitude
i
have
ventured
to
remind
my
readers
of
this
last
scene
somewhat
in
detail
because
it
seemed
to
reveal
the
state
of
mind
of
the
remarkable
personage
who
now
stood
before
me
apparently
he
had
not
then
been
animated
by
sentiments
hostile
to
humanity
he
was
content
to
await
the
future
though
his
attitude
undeniably
revealed
the
immeasurable
confidence
which
he
had
in
his
own
genius
the
immense
pride
which
his
almost
superhuman
powers
had
aroused
within
him
it
was
not
astonishing
moreover
that
this
haughtiness
had
little
by
little
been
aggravated
to
such
a
degree
that
he
now
presumed
to
enslave
the
entire
world
as
his
public
letter
had
suggested
by
its
significant
threats
his
vehement
mind
had
with
time
been
roused
to
such
that
he
might
easily
be
driven
into
the
most
violent
excesses
as
to
what
had
happened
in
the
years
since
the
last
departure
of
the
albatross
i
could
only
partly
reconstruct
this
even
with
my
present
knowledge
it
had
not
sufficed
the
prodigious
inventor
to
create
a
flying
machine
perfect
as
that
was
he
had
planned
to
construct
a
machine
which
could
conquer
all
the
elements
at
once
probably
in
the
workshops
of
island
x
a
selected
body
of
devoted
workmen
had
constructed
one
by
one
the
pieces
of
this
marvelous
machine
with
its
quadruple
transformation
then
the
second
albatross
must
have
carried
these
pieces
to
the
great
eyrie
where
they
had
been
put
together
within
easier
access
of
the
world
of
men
than
the
island
had
permitted
the
albatross
itself
had
apparently
been
destroyed
whether
by
accident
or
design
within
the
eyrie
the
terror
had
then
made
its
appearance
on
the
roads
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
neighboring
waters
and
i
have
told
under
what
conditions
after
having
been
vainly
pursued
across
lake
erie
this
remarkable
masterpiece
had
risen
through
the
air
carrying
me
a
prisoner
on
board
chapter
in
the
name
of
the
law
what
was
to
be
the
issue
of
this
remarkable
adventure
could
i
bring
it
to
any
denouement
whatever
either
sooner
or
later
did
not
robur
hold
the
results
wholly
in
his
own
hands
probably
i
would
never
have
such
an
opportunity
for
escape
as
had
occurred
to
mr
prudent
and
evans
amid
the
islands
of
the
pacific
i
could
only
wait
and
how
long
might
the
waiting
last
to
be
sure
my
curiosity
had
been
partly
satisfied
but
even
now
i
knew
only
the
answer
to
the
problems
of
the
great
eyrie
having
at
length
penetrated
its
circle
i
comprehended
all
the
phenomena
observed
by
the
people
of
the
blueridge
mountains
i
was
assured
that
neither
the
throughout
the
region
nor
the
townfolk
of
pleasant
garden
and
morganton
were
in
danger
of
volcanic
eruptions
or
earthquakes
no
subterranean
forces
whatever
were
battling
within
the
bowels
of
the
mountains
no
crater
had
arisen
in
this
corner
of
the
alleghanies
the
great
eyrie
served
merely
as
the
retreat
of
robur
the
conqueror
this
impenetrable
where
he
stored
his
materials
and
provisions
had
without
doubt
been
discovered
by
him
during
one
of
his
aerial
voyages
in
the
albatross
it
was
a
retreat
probably
even
more
secure
than
that
as
yet
undiscovered
island
x
in
the
pacific
this
much
i
knew
of
him
but
of
this
marvelous
machine
of
his
of
the
secrets
of
its
construction
and
propelling
force
what
did
i
really
know
admitting
that
this
multiple
mechanism
was
driven
by
electricity
and
that
this
electricity
was
as
we
knew
it
had
been
in
the
albatross
extracted
directly
from
the
surrounding
air
by
some
new
process
what
were
the
details
of
its
mechanism
i
had
not
been
permitted
to
see
the
engine
doubtless
i
should
never
see
it
on
the
question
of
my
liberty
i
argued
thus
robur
evidently
intends
to
remain
unknown
as
to
what
he
intends
to
do
with
his
machine
i
fear
recalling
his
letter
that
the
world
must
expect
from
it
more
of
evil
than
of
good
at
any
rate
the
incognito
which
he
has
so
carefully
guarded
in
the
past
he
must
mean
to
preserve
in
the
future
now
only
one
man
can
establish
the
identity
of
the
master
of
the
world
with
robur
the
conqueror
this
man
is
i
his
prisoner
i
who
have
the
right
to
arrest
him
i
who
ought
to
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
saying
in
the
name
of
the
law
on
the
other
hand
could
i
hope
for
a
rescue
from
with
out
evidently
not
the
police
authorities
must
know
everything
that
had
happened
at
black
rock
creek
ward
advised
of
all
the
incidents
would
have
reasoned
on
the
matter
as
follows
when
the
terror
quitted
the
creek
dragging
me
at
the
end
of
her
hawser
i
had
either
been
drowned
or
since
my
body
had
not
been
recovered
i
had
been
taken
on
board
the
terror
and
was
in
the
hands
of
its
commander
in
the
first
case
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
than
to
write
deceased
after
the
name
of
john
strock
chief
inspector
of
the
federal
police
in
washington
in
the
second
case
could
my
confreres
hope
ever
to
see
me
again
the
two
destroyers
which
had
pursued
the
terror
into
the
niagara
river
had
stopped
perforce
when
the
current
threatened
to
drag
them
over
the
falls
at
that
moment
night
was
closing
in
and
what
could
be
thought
on
board
the
destroyers
but
that
the
terror
had
been
engulfed
in
the
abyss
of
the
cataract
it
was
scarce
possible
that
our
machine
had
been
seen
when
amid
the
shades
of
night
it
rose
above
the
horseshoe
falls
or
when
it
winged
its
way
high
above
the
mountains
on
its
route
to
the
great
eyrie
with
regard
to
my
own
fate
should
i
resolve
to
question
robur
would
he
consent
even
to
appear
to
hear
me
was
he
not
content
with
having
hurled
at
me
his
name
would
not
that
name
seem
to
him
to
answer
everything
that
day
wore
away
without
bringing
the
least
change
to
the
situation
robur
and
his
men
continued
actively
at
work
upon
the
machine
which
apparently
needed
considerable
repair
i
concluded
that
they
meant
to
start
forth
again
very
shortly
and
to
take
me
with
them
it
would
however
have
been
quite
possible
to
leave
me
at
the
bottom
of
the
eyrie
there
would
have
been
no
way
by
which
i
could
have
escaped
and
there
were
provisions
at
hand
sufficient
to
keep
me
alive
for
many
days
what
i
studied
particularly
during
this
period
was
the
mental
state
of
robur
he
seemed
to
me
under
the
dominance
of
a
continuous
excitement
what
was
it
that
his
brain
now
meditated
what
projects
was
he
forming
for
the
future
toward
what
region
would
he
now
turn
would
he
put
in
execution
the
menaces
expressed
in
his
letter
the
menaces
of
a
madman
the
night
of
that
first
day
i
slept
on
a
couch
of
dry
grass
in
one
of
the
grottoes
of
the
great
eyrie
food
was
set
for
me
in
this
grotto
each
succeeding
day
on
the
second
and
third
of
august
the
three
men
continued
at
their
work
scarcely
once
however
exchanging
any
words
even
in
the
midst
of
their
labors
when
the
engines
were
all
repaired
to
robur
satisfaction
the
men
began
putting
stores
aboard
their
craft
as
if
expecting
a
long
absence
perhaps
the
terror
was
about
to
traverse
immense
distances
perhaps
even
the
captain
intended
to
regain
his
island
x
in
the
midst
of
the
pacific
sometimes
i
saw
him
wander
about
the
eyrie
buried
in
thought
or
he
would
stop
and
raise
his
arm
toward
heaven
as
if
in
defiance
of
that
god
with
whom
he
assumed
to
divide
the
empire
of
the
world
was
not
his
overweening
pride
leading
him
toward
insanity
an
insanity
which
his
two
companions
hardly
less
excited
than
he
could
do
nothing
to
subdue
had
he
not
come
to
regard
himself
as
mightier
than
the
elements
which
he
had
so
audaciously
defied
even
when
he
possessed
only
an
airship
the
albatross
and
now
how
much
more
powerful
had
he
become
when
earth
air
and
water
combined
to
offer
him
an
infinite
field
where
none
might
follow
him
hence
i
had
much
to
fear
from
the
future
even
the
most
dread
catastrophes
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
escape
from
the
great
eyrie
before
being
dragged
into
a
new
voyage
after
that
how
could
i
possibly
get
away
while
the
terror
sped
through
the
air
or
the
ocean
my
only
chance
must
be
when
she
crossed
the
land
and
did
so
at
some
moderate
speed
surely
a
distant
and
feeble
hope
to
cling
to
it
will
be
recalled
that
after
our
arrival
at
the
great
eyrie
i
had
attempted
to
obtain
some
response
from
robur
as
to
his
purpose
with
me
but
i
had
failed
on
this
last
day
i
made
another
attempt
in
the
afternoon
i
walked
up
and
down
before
the
large
grotto
where
my
captors
were
at
work
robur
standing
at
the
entrance
followed
me
steadily
with
his
eyes
did
he
mean
to
address
me
i
went
up
to
him
captain
said
i
i
have
already
asked
you
a
question
which
you
have
not
answered
i
ask
it
again
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
me
we
stood
face
to
face
scarce
two
steps
apart
with
arms
folded
he
glared
at
me
and
i
was
terrified
by
his
glance
terrified
that
is
the
word
the
glance
was
not
that
of
a
sane
man
indeed
it
seemed
to
reflect
nothing
whatever
of
humanity
within
i
repeated
my
question
in
a
more
challenging
tone
for
an
instant
i
thought
that
robur
would
break
his
silence
and
burst
forth
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
me
will
you
set
me
free
evidently
my
captor
mind
was
obsessed
by
some
other
thought
from
which
i
had
only
distracted
him
for
a
moment
he
made
again
that
gesture
which
i
had
already
observed
he
raised
one
defiant
arm
toward
the
zenith
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
some
irresistible
force
drew
him
toward
those
upper
zones
of
the
sky
that
he
belonged
no
more
to
the
earth
that
he
was
destined
to
live
in
space
a
perpetual
dweller
in
the
clouds
without
answering
me
without
seeming
to
have
understood
me
robur
reentered
the
grotto
how
long
this
sojourn
or
rather
relaxation
of
the
terror
in
the
great
eyrie
was
to
last
i
did
not
know
i
saw
however
on
the
afternoon
of
this
third
of
august
that
the
repairs
and
the
embarkation
of
stores
were
completed
the
hold
and
lockers
of
our
craft
must
have
been
completely
crowded
with
the
provisions
taken
from
the
grottoes
of
the
eyrie
then
the
chief
of
the
two
assistants
a
man
whom
i
now
recognized
as
that
john
turner
who
had
been
mate
of
the
albatross
began
another
labor
with
the
help
of
his
companion
he
dragged
to
the
center
of
the
hollow
all
that
remained
of
their
materials
empty
cases
fragments
of
carpentry
peculiar
pieces
of
wood
which
clearly
must
have
belonged
to
the
albatross
which
had
been
sacrificed
to
this
new
and
mightier
engine
of
locomotion
beneath
this
mass
there
lay
a
great
quantity
of
dried
grasses
the
thought
came
to
me
that
robur
was
preparing
to
leave
this
retreat
forever
in
fact
he
could
not
be
ignorant
that
the
attention
of
the
public
was
now
keenly
fixed
upon
the
great
eyrie
and
that
some
further
attempt
was
likely
to
be
made
to
penetrate
it
must
he
not
fear
that
some
day
or
other
the
effort
would
be
successful
and
that
men
would
end
by
invading
his
did
he
not
wish
that
they
should
find
there
no
single
evidence
of
his
occupation
the
sun
disappeared
behind
the
crests
of
the
blueridge
his
rays
now
lighted
only
the
very
summit
of
black
dome
towering
in
the
northwest
probably
the
terror
awaited
only
the
night
in
order
to
begin
her
flight
the
world
did
not
yet
know
that
the
automobile
and
boat
could
also
transform
itself
into
a
flying
machine
until
now
it
had
never
been
seen
in
the
air
and
would
not
this
fourth
transformation
be
carefully
concealed
until
the
day
when
the
master
of
the
world
chose
to
put
into
execution
his
insensate
menaces
toward
nine
profound
obscurity
enwrapped
the
hollow
not
a
star
looked
down
on
us
heavy
clouds
driven
by
a
keen
eastern
wind
covered
the
entire
sky
the
passage
of
the
terror
would
be
invisible
not
only
in
our
immediate
neighborhood
but
probably
across
all
the
american
territory
and
even
the
adjoining
seas
at
this
moment
turner
approaching
the
huge
stack
in
the
middle
of
the
eyrie
set
fire
to
the
grass
beneath
the
whole
mass
flared
up
at
once
from
the
midst
of
a
dense
smoke
the
roaring
flames
rose
to
a
height
which
towered
above
the
walls
of
the
great
eyrie
once
more
the
good
folk
of
morganton
and
pleasant
garden
would
believe
that
the
crater
had
reopened
these
flames
would
announce
to
them
another
volcanic
upheaval
i
watched
the
conflagration
i
heard
the
roarings
and
cracklings
which
filled
the
air
from
the
deck
of
the
terror
robur
watched
it
also
turner
and
his
companion
pushed
back
into
the
fire
the
fragments
which
the
violence
of
the
flames
cast
forth
little
by
little
the
huge
bonfire
grew
less
the
flames
sank
down
into
a
mere
mass
of
ashes
and
once
more
all
was
silence
and
blackest
night
suddenly
i
felt
myself
seized
by
the
arm
turner
drew
me
toward
the
terror
resistance
would
have
been
useless
and
moreover
what
could
be
worse
than
to
be
abandoned
without
resources
in
this
prison
whose
walls
i
could
not
climb
as
soon
as
i
set
foot
on
the
deck
turner
also
embarked
his
companion
went
forward
to
the
turner
climbed
down
into
the
lighted
by
electric
bulbs
from
which
not
a
gleam
escaped
outside
robur
himself
was
at
the
helm
the
regulator
within
reach
of
his
hand
so
that
he
could
control
both
our
speed
and
our
direction
as
to
me
i
was
forced
to
descend
into
my
cabin
and
the
hatchway
was
fastened
above
me
during
that
night
as
on
that
of
our
departure
from
niagara
i
was
not
allowed
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
terror
nevertheless
if
i
could
see
nothing
of
what
was
passing
on
board
i
could
hear
the
noises
of
the
machinery
i
had
first
the
feeling
that
our
craft
its
bow
slightly
raised
lost
contact
with
the
earth
some
swerves
and
balancings
in
the
air
followed
then
the
turbines
underneath
spun
with
prodigious
rapidity
while
the
great
wings
beat
with
steady
regularity
thus
the
terror
probably
forever
had
left
the
great
eyrie
and
launched
into
the
air
as
a
ship
launches
into
the
waters
our
captain
soared
above
the
double
chain
of
the
alleghanies
and
without
doubt
he
would
remain
in
the
upper
zones
of
the
air
until
he
had
left
all
the
mountain
region
behind
but
in
what
direction
would
he
turn
would
he
pass
in
flight
across
the
plains
of
north
carolina
seeking
the
atlantic
ocean
or
would
he
head
to
the
west
to
reach
the
pacific
perhaps
he
would
seek
to
the
south
the
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
when
day
came
how
should
i
recognize
which
sea
we
were
upon
if
the
horizon
of
water
and
sky
encircled
us
on
every
side
several
hours
passed
and
how
long
they
seemed
to
me
i
made
no
effort
to
find
forgetfulness
in
sleep
wild
and
incoherent
thoughts
assailed
me
i
felt
myself
swept
over
worlds
of
imagination
as
i
was
swept
through
space
by
an
aerial
monster
at
the
speed
which
the
terror
possessed
whither
might
i
not
be
carried
during
this
interminable
night
i
recalled
the
unbelievable
voyage
of
the
albatross
of
which
the
weldon
institute
had
published
an
account
as
described
by
mr
prudent
and
evans
what
robur
the
conqueror
had
done
with
his
first
airship
he
could
do
even
more
readily
with
this
quadruple
machine
at
length
the
first
rays
of
daylight
brightened
my
cabin
would
i
be
permitted
to
go
out
now
to
take
my
place
upon
the
deck
as
i
had
done
upon
lake
erie
i
pushed
upon
the
hatchway
it
opened
i
came
half
way
out
upon
the
deck
all
about
was
sky
and
sea
we
floated
in
the
air
above
an
ocean
at
a
height
which
i
judged
to
be
about
a
thousand
or
twelve
hundred
feet
i
could
not
see
robur
so
he
was
probably
in
the
engine
room
turner
was
at
the
helm
his
companion
on
the
now
that
i
was
upon
the
deck
i
saw
what
i
had
not
been
able
to
see
during
our
former
nocturnal
voyage
the
action
of
those
powerful
wings
which
beat
upon
either
side
at
the
same
time
that
the
screws
spun
beneath
the
flanks
of
the
machine
by
the
position
of
the
sun
as
it
slowly
mounted
from
the
horizon
i
realized
that
we
were
advancing
toward
the
south
hence
if
this
direction
had
not
been
changed
during
the
night
this
was
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
lay
beneath
us
a
hot
day
was
announced
by
the
heavy
livid
clouds
which
clung
to
the
horizon
these
warnings
of
a
coming
storm
did
not
escape
the
eye
of
robur
when
toward
eight
he
came
on
deck
and
took
place
at
the
helm
perhaps
the
recalled
to
him
the
waterspout
in
which
the
albatross
had
so
nearly
been
destroyed
or
the
mighty
cyclone
from
which
he
had
escaped
only
as
if
by
a
miracle
above
the
antarctic
sea
it
is
true
that
the
forces
of
nature
which
had
been
too
strong
for
the
albatross
might
easily
be
evaded
by
this
lighter
and
more
versatile
machine
it
could
abandon
the
sky
where
the
elements
were
in
battle
and
descend
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
if
the
waves
beat
against
it
there
too
heavily
it
could
always
find
calm
in
the
tranquil
depths
doubtless
however
there
were
some
signs
by
which
robur
who
must
be
experienced
in
judging
decided
that
the
storm
would
not
burst
until
the
next
day
he
continued
his
flight
and
in
the
afternoon
when
we
settled
down
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
there
was
not
a
sign
of
bad
weather
the
terror
is
a
sea
bird
an
albatross
or
which
can
rest
at
will
upon
the
waves
only
we
have
this
advantage
that
fatigue
has
never
any
hold
upon
this
metal
organism
driven
by
the
inexhaustible
electricity
the
whole
vast
ocean
around
us
was
empty
not
a
sail
nor
a
trail
of
smoke
was
visible
even
on
the
limits
of
the
horizon
hence
our
passage
through
the
clouds
had
not
been
seen
and
signaled
ahead
the
afternoon
was
not
marked
by
any
incident
the
terror
advanced
at
easy
speed
what
her
captain
intended
to
do
i
could
not
guess
if
he
continued
in
this
direction
we
should
reach
some
one
of
the
west
indies
or
beyond
that
at
the
end
of
the
gulf
the
shore
of
venezuela
or
colombia
but
when
night
came
perhaps
we
would
again
rise
in
the
air
to
clear
the
mountainous
barrier
of
guatemala
and
nicaragua
and
take
flight
toward
island
x
somewhere
in
the
unknown
regions
of
the
pacific
evening
came
the
sun
sank
in
an
horizon
red
as
blood
the
sea
glistened
around
the
terror
which
seemed
to
raise
a
shower
of
sparks
in
its
passage
there
was
a
storm
at
hand
evidently
our
captain
thought
so
instead
of
being
allowed
to
remain
on
deck
i
was
compelled
to
my
cabin
and
the
hatchway
was
closed
above
me
in
a
few
moments
from
the
noises
that
followed
i
knew
that
the
machine
was
about
to
be
submerged
in
fact
five
minutes
later
we
were
moving
peacefully
forward
through
the
ocean
depths
thoroughly
worn
out
less
by
fatigue
than
by
excitement
and
anxious
thought
i
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
natural
this
time
and
not
provoked
by
any
soporific
drug
when
i
awoke
after
a
length
of
time
which
i
could
not
reckon
the
terror
had
not
yet
returned
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
this
maneuver
was
executed
a
little
later
the
daylight
pierced
my
porthole
and
at
the
same
moment
i
felt
the
pitching
and
tossing
to
which
we
were
subjected
by
a
heavy
sea
i
was
allowed
to
take
my
place
once
more
outside
the
hatchway
where
my
first
thought
was
for
the
weather
a
storm
was
approaching
from
the
northwest
vivid
lightning
darted
amid
the
dense
black
clouds
already
we
could
hear
the
rumbling
of
thunder
echoing
continuously
through
space
i
was
surprised
more
than
surprised
frightened
by
the
rapidity
with
which
the
storm
rushed
upward
toward
the
zenith
scarcely
would
a
ship
have
had
time
to
furl
her
sails
to
escape
the
shock
of
the
blast
before
it
was
upon
her
the
advance
was
as
swift
as
it
was
terrible
suddenly
the
wind
was
unchained
with
unheard
of
violence
as
if
it
had
suddenly
burst
from
this
prison
of
cloud
in
an
instant
a
frightful
sea
uprose
the
breaking
waves
foaming
along
all
their
crests
swept
with
their
full
weight
over
the
terror
if
i
had
not
been
wedged
solidly
against
the
rail
i
should
have
been
swept
overboard
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
to
change
our
machine
again
into
a
submarine
it
would
find
security
and
calm
at
a
few
dozen
feet
beneath
the
surface
to
continue
to
brave
the
fury
of
this
outrageous
sea
was
impossible
robur
himself
was
on
deck
and
i
awaited
the
order
to
return
to
my
cabin
an
order
which
was
not
given
there
was
not
even
any
preparation
for
the
plunge
with
an
eye
more
burning
than
ever
impassive
before
this
frightful
storm
the
captain
looked
it
full
in
the
face
as
if
to
defy
it
knowing
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
it
was
imperative
that
the
terror
should
plunge
below
without
losing
a
moment
yet
robur
seemed
to
have
no
thought
of
doing
so
no
he
preserved
his
haughty
attitude
as
of
a
man
who
in
his
immeasurable
pride
believed
himself
above
or
beyond
humanity
seeing
him
thus
i
asked
myself
with
almost
superstitious
awe
if
he
were
not
indeed
a
demoniac
being
escaped
from
some
supernatural
world
a
cry
leaped
from
his
mouth
and
was
heard
amid
the
shrieks
of
the
tempest
and
the
howlings
of
the
thunder
i
robur
robur
the
master
of
the
world
he
made
a
gesture
which
turner
and
his
companions
understood
it
was
a
command
and
without
any
hesitation
these
unhappy
men
insane
as
their
master
obeyed
it
the
great
wings
shot
out
and
the
airship
rose
as
it
had
risen
above
the
falls
of
niagara
but
if
on
that
day
it
had
escaped
the
might
of
the
cataract
this
time
it
was
amidst
the
might
of
the
hurricane
that
we
attempted
our
insensate
flight
the
soared
upward
into
the
heart
of
the
sky
amid
a
thousand
lightning
flashes
surrounded
and
shaken
by
the
bursts
of
thunder
it
steered
amid
the
blinding
darting
lights
courting
destruction
at
every
instant
robur
position
and
attitude
did
not
change
with
one
hand
on
the
helm
the
other
on
the
speed
regulators
while
the
great
wings
beat
furiously
he
headed
his
machine
toward
the
very
center
of
the
storm
where
the
electric
flashes
were
leaping
from
cloud
to
cloud
i
must
throw
myself
upon
this
madman
to
prevent
him
from
driving
his
machine
into
the
very
middle
of
this
aerial
furnace
i
must
compel
him
to
descend
to
seek
beneath
the
waters
a
safety
which
was
no
longer
possible
either
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
or
in
the
sky
beneath
we
could
wait
until
this
frightful
outburst
of
the
elements
was
at
an
end
then
amid
this
wild
excitement
my
own
passion
all
my
instincts
of
duty
arose
within
me
yes
this
was
madness
yet
must
i
not
arrest
this
criminal
whom
my
country
had
outlawed
who
threatened
the
entire
world
with
his
terrible
invention
must
i
not
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
summon
him
to
surrender
to
justice
was

or
was
i

strock
chief
inspector
of
the
federal
police
forgetting
where
i
was
one
against

uplifted
in
above
a
howling
ocean
i
leaped
toward
the
stern
and
in
a
voice
which
rose
above
the
tempest
i
cried
as
i
hurled
myself
upon
robur
in
the
name
of
the
law
i
suddenly
the
terror
trembled
as
if
from
a
violent
shock
all
her
frame
quivered
as
the
human
frame
quivers
under
the
electric
fluid
struck
by
the
lightning
in
the
very
middle
of
her
powerful
batteries
the
spread
out
on
all
sides
and
went
to
pieces
with
her
wings
fallen
her
screws
broken
with
bolt
after
bolt
of
the
lightning
darting
amid
her
ruins
the
terror
fell
from
the
height
of
more
than
a
thousand
feet
into
the
ocean
beneath
chapter
the
old
housekeeper
last
comment
when
i
came
to
myself
after
having
been
unconscious
for
many
hours
a
group
of
sailors
whose
care
had
restored
me
to
life
surrounded
the
door
of
a
cabin
in
which
i
lay
by
my
pillow
sat
an
officer
who
questioned
me
and
as
my
senses
slowly
returned
i
answered
to
his
questioning
i
told
them
everything
yes
everything
and
assuredly
my
listeners
must
have
thought
that
they
had
upon
their
hands
an
unfortunate
whose
reason
had
not
returned
with
his
consciousness
i
was
on
board
the
steamer
ottawa
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
headed
for
the
port
of
new
orleans
this
ship
while
flying
before
the
same
terrific
which
destroyed
the
terror
had
encountered
some
wreckage
among
whose
fragments
was
entangled
my
helpless
body
thus
i
found
myself
back
among
humankind
once
more
while
robur
the
conqueror
and
his
two
companions
had
ended
their
adventurous
careers
in
the
waters
of
the
gulf
the
master
of
the
world
had
disappeared
forever
struck
down
by
those
which
he
had
dared
to
brave
in
the
regions
of
their
fullest
power
he
carried
with
him
the
secret
of
his
extraordinary
machine
five
days
later
the
ottawa
sighted
the
shores
of
louisiana
and
on
the
morning
of
the
tenth
of
august
she
reached
her
port
after
taking
a
warm
leave
of
my
rescuers
i
set
out
at
once
by
train
for
washington
which
more
than
once
i
had
despaired
of
ever
seeing
again
i
went
first
of
all
to
the
bureau
of
police
meaning
to
make
my
earliest
appearance
before
ward
what
was
the
surprise
the
stupefaction
and
also
the
joy
of
my
chief
when
the
door
of
his
cabinet
opened
before
me
had
he
not
every
reason
to
believe
from
the
report
of
my
companions
that
i
had
perished
in
the
waters
of
lake
erie
i
informed
him
of
all
my
experiences
since
i
had
disappeared
the
pursuit
of
the
destroyers
on
the
lake
the
soaring
of
the
terror
from
amid
niagara
falls
the
halt
within
the
crater
of
the
great
eyrie
and
the
catastrophe
during
the
storm
above
the
gulf
of
mexico
he
learned
for
the
first
time
that
the
machine
created
by
the
genius
of
this
robur
could
traverse
space
as
it
did
the
earth
and
the
sea
in
truth
did
not
the
possession
of
so
complete
and
marvelous
a
machine
justify
the
name
of
master
of
the
world
which
robur
had
taken
to
himself
certain
it
is
that
the
comfort
and
even
the
lives
of
the
public
must
have
been
forever
in
danger
from
him
and
that
all
methods
of
defence
must
have
been
feeble
and
ineffective
but
the
pride
which
i
had
seen
rising
bit
by
bit
within
the
heart
of
this
prodigious
man
had
driven
him
to
give
equal
battle
to
the
most
terrible
of
all
the
elements
it
was
a
miracle
that
i
had
escaped
safe
and
sound
from
that
frightful
catastrophe
ward
could
scarcely
believe
my
story
well
my
dear
strock
said
he
at
last
you
have
come
back
and
that
is
the
main
thing
next
to
this
notorious
robur
you
will
be
the
man
of
the
hour
i
hope
that
your
head
will
not
be
turned
with
vanity
like
that
of
this
crazy
inventor
no
ward
i
responded
but
you
will
agree
with
me
that
never
was
inquisitive
man
put
to
greater
straits
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
i
agree
strock
and
the
mysteries
of
the
great
eyrie
the
transformations
of
the
terror
you
have
discovered
them
but
unfortunately
the
still
greater
secrets
of
this
master
of
the
world
have
perished
with
him
the
same
evening
the
newspapers
published
an
account
of
my
adventures
the
truthfulness
of
which
could
not
be
doubted
then
as
ward
had
prophesied
i
was
the
man
of
the
hour
one
of
the
papers
said
thanks
to
inspector
strock
the
american
police
still
lead
the
world
while
others
have
accomplished
their
work
with
more
or
less
success
by
land
and
by
sea
the
american
police
hurl
themselves
in
pursuit
of
criminals
through
the
depths
of
lakes
and
oceans
and
even
through
the
sky
yet
in
following
as
i
have
told
in
pursuit
of
the
terror
had
i
done
anything
more
than
by
the
close
of
the
present
century
will
have
become
the
regular
duty
of
my
successors
it
is
easy
to
imagine
what
a
welcome
my
old
housekeeper
gave
me
when
i
entered
my
house
in
long
street
when
my
apparition
does
not
the
word
seem
just
stood
before
her
i
feared
for
a
moment
she
would
drop
dead
poor
woman
then
after
hearing
my
story
with
eyes
streaming
with
tears
she
thanked
providence
for
having
saved
me
from
so
many
perils
now
sir
said
she
now
was
i
wrong
wrong
about
what
in
saying
that
the
great
eyrie
was
the
home
of
the
devil
nonsense
this
robur
was
not
the
devil
ah
well
replied
the
old
woman
he
was
worthy
of
being
so
