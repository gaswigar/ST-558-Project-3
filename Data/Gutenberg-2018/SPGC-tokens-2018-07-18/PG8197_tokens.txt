nicolson
a
man
twice
her
age
she
committed
suicide
two
months
after
his
death
in
less
than
the
dust
less
than
the
dust
beneath
thy
chariot
wheel
less
than
the
rust
that
never
stained
thy
sword
less
than
the
trust
thou
hast
in
me
o
lord
even
less
than
these
less
than
the
weed
that
grows
beside
thy
door
less
than
the
speed
of
hours
spent
far
from

less
than
the
need
thou
hast
in

of
me
even
less
am
i
since

am
nothing
unto
thee
see
here
thy
sword
i
make
it
keen
and
bright
love
last
reward
death
comes
to
me
farewell
to
the
unattainable
oh
that
my
blood
were
water
thou
athirst
and
thou
and
i
in
some
far
desert
land
how
would
i
shed
it
gladly
if
but
first
it
touched
thy
lips
before
it
reached
the
sand
once
ah
the
gods
were
good
to
me
i
threw
myself
upon
a
poison
snake
that
crept
where
my
beloved
a
lesser
love
we
knew
than
this
which
now
consumes
me
wholly
slept
but
thou
alas
what
can
i
do
for
thee
by
fate
and
thine
own
beauty
set
above
the
need
of
all
or
any
aid
from
me
too
high
for
service
as
too
far
for
love
in
the
early
pearly
morning
song
by
valgovind
the
fields
are
full
of
poppies
and
the
skies
are
very
blue
by
the
temple
in
the
coppice
i
wait
beloved
for
you
the
level
land
is
sunny
and
the
errant
air
is
gay
with
scent
of
rose
and
honey
will
you
come
to
me
from
carven
walls
above
me
smile
lovers
many
a
pair
oh
take
this
rose
and
love
me
she
has
twined
it
in
her
hair
he
advances
she
retreating
pursues
and
holds
her
fast
the
sculptor
left
them
meeting
in
a
close
embrace
at
last
through
centuries
together
in
the
carven
stone
they
lie
in
the
glow
of
golden
weather
and
endless
azure
sky
oh
that
we
who
have
for
pleasure
so
short
and
scant
a
stay
should
waste
our
summer
leisure
will
you
come
to
me
the
temple
bells
are
ringing
for
the
marriage
month
has
come
i
hear
the
women
singing
and
the
throbbing
of
the
drum
and
when
the
song
is
failing
or
the
drums
a
moment
mute
the
weirdly
wistful
wailing
of
the
melancholy
flute
little
life
has
got
to
offer
and
little
man
to
lose
since
fate
deigns
to
proffer
oh
wherefore
then
refuse
to
take
this
transient
hour
in
the
dusky
temple
gloom
while
the
poppies
are
in
flower
and
the
mangoe
trees
abloom
and
if
fate
remember
later
and
come
to
claim
her
due
what
sorrow
will
be
greater
than
the
joy
i
had
with
you
for
lit
by
your
laughter
between
the
crushing
years
i
will
chance
in
the
hereafter
eternities
of
tears
reverie
of
mahomed
akram
at
the
tamarind
tank
the
desert
is
parched
in
the
burning
sun
and
the
grass
is
scorched
and
white
but
the
sand
is
passed
and
the
march
is
done
we
are
camping
here
i
sit
in
the
shade
of
the
temple
walls
while
the
cadenced
water
evenly
falls
and
a
peacock
out
of
the
jungle
calls
to
another
on
yonder
tomb
above
half
seen
in
the
lofty
gloom
strange
works
of
a
long
dead
people
loom
obscene
and
savage
and
half
effaced
an
elephant
hunt
a
musicians
feast
and
curious
matings
of
man
and
beast
what
did
they
mean
to
the
men
who
are
long
since
dust
whose
fingers
traced
in
this
arid
waste
these
rioting
twisted
figures
of
love
and
lust
strange
weird
things
that
no
man
may
say
things
humanity
hides
away
secretly
done
catch
the
light
of
the
living
day
smile
in
the
sun
cruel
things
that
man
may
not
name
naked
here
without
fear
or
shame
laughed
in
the
carven
stone
deep
in
the
temple
innermost
shrine
is
set
where
the
bats
and
shadows
dwell
the
worn
and
ancient
symbol
of
life
at
rest
in
its
oval
shell
by
which
the
men
who
of
old
the
land
possessed
represented
their
great
destroying
power
i
can
not
forget
that
just
as
my
life
was
touching
its
fullest
flower
love
came
and
destroyed
it
all
in
a
single
hour
therefore
the
dual
mystery
suits
me
well
sitting
alone
the
tank
deep
water
is
cool
and
sweet
soothing
and
fresh
to
the
wayworn
feet
dreaming
under
the
tamarind
shade
one
silently
thanks
the
men
who
made
so
green
a
place
in
this
bitter
land
of
sunburnt
sand
the
peacocks
scream
and
the
grey
doves
coo
little
green
talkative
parrots
woo
and
small
grey
squirrels
with
fear
askance
at
alien
me
in
their
furtive
glance
come
shyly
with
quivering
fur
to
see
the
stranger
under
their
tamarind
tree
daylight
dies
the
camp
fires
redden
like
angry
eyes
the
tents
show
white
in
the
glimmering
light
spirals
of
tremulous
smoke
arise
to
the
purple
skies
and
the
hum
of
the
camp
sounds
like
the
sea
drifting
over
the
sand
to
me
afar
in
the
desert
some
wild
voice
sings
to
a
jangling
zither
with
minor
strings
and
under
the
stars
growing
keen
above
i
think
of
the
thing
that
i
love
a
beautiful
thing
alert
serene
with
passionate
dreaming
wistful
eyes
dark
and
deep
as
mysterious
skies
seen
from
a
vessel
at
sea
alas
you
drifted
away
from
me
and
time
and
space
have
rushed
in
between
but
they
can
not
undo
the
though
it
never
again
may
be
you
were
mine
from
dusk
until
dawning
light
for
the
perfect
whole
of
that
bygone
night
you
belonged
to
me
they
say
that
love
is
a
light
thing
a
foolish
thing
and
a
slight
thing
a
ripe
fruit
rotten
at
core
they
speak
in
this
futile
fashion
to
me
who
am
wracked
with
passion
tormented
beyond
compassion
for
ever
and
ever
more
they
say
that
possession
lessens
a
lover
delight
as
radiant
mornings
fade
into
afternoon
i
held
what
i
loved
in
my
arms
for
many
a
night
yet
ever
the
morning
lightened
the
sky
too
soon
beyond
our
tents
the
sands
stretch
level
and
far
around
this
little
oasis
of
tamarind
trees
a
curious
eastern
fragrance
fills
the
breeze
from
the
ruinous
temple
garden
where
roses
are
i
dream
of
the
perfume
that
fills
your
hair
of
times
when
my
lips
were
free
of
your
soft
closed
eyes
while
down
in
the
tank
the
waters
ripple
and
rise
and
the
flying
foxes
silently
cleave
the
air
the
present
is
subtly
welded
into
the
past
my
love
of
you
with
the
purple
indian
dusk
with
its
clinging
scent
of
sandal
incense
and
musk
and
withering
jasmin
flowers
my
eyes
grow
dim
and
my
senses
fail
at
last
while
the
lonely
hours
follow
each
other
silently
one
by
one
till
the
night
is
almost
done
then
weary
and
drunk
with
dreams
with
my
garments
damp
and
heavy
with
dew
i
wander
towards
the
camp
tired
with
a
brain
in
which
fancy
and
fact
are
blent
i
stumble
across
the
ropes
till
i
reach
my
tent
and
then
to
rest
to
ensweeten
my
sleep
with
lies
to
dream
i
lie
in
the
light
of
your
long
lost
eyes
my
lips
set
free
to
love
and
linger
over
your
soft
loose
hair
to
dream
i
lay
your
delicate
beauty
bare
to
solace
my
fevered
eyes
ah
if
my
life
might
end
in
a
night
like
this
drift
into
death
from
dreams
of
your
granted
kiss
verses
you
are
my
god
and
i
would
fain
adore
you
with
sweet
and
secret
rites
of
other
days
burn
scented
oil
in
silver
lamps
before
you
pour
perfume
on
your
feet
with
prayer
and
praise
yet
are
we
one
your
gracious
condescension
granted
and
grants
the
loveliness
i
crave
one
in
the
perfect
sense
of
eastern
mention
gold
and
the
bracelet
water
and
the
wave
song
of
khan
zada
as
one
may
sip
a
stranger
bowl
you
gave
yourself
but
not
your
soul
i
wonder
now
that
time
has
passed
where
you
will
come
to
rest
at
last
you
gave
your
beauty
for
an
hour
i
held
it
gently
as
a
flower
you
wished
to
leave
me
told
me
so
i
kissed
your
feet
and
let
you
go
the
teak
forest
whether
i
loved
you
who
shall
say
whether
i
drifted
down
your
way
in
the
endless
river
of
chance
and
change
and
you
woke
the
strange
unknown
longings
that
have
no
names
but
burn
us
all
in
their
hidden
flames
who
shall
say
life
is
a
strange
and
a
wayward
thing
we
heard
the
bells
of
the
temples
ring
the
married
children
in
passing
sing
the
month
of
marriage
the
month
of
spring
was
full
of
the
breath
of
sunburnt
flowers
that
bloom
in
a
fiercer
light
than
ours
and
under
a
sky
more
fiercely
blue
i
came
to
you
you
told
me
tales
of
your
vivid
life
where
death
was
cruel
and
danger
rife
of
deep
dark
forests
of
poisoned
trees
of
pains
and
passions
that
scorch
and
freeze
of
southern
noontides
and
eastern
nights
where
love
grew
frantic
with
strange
delights
while
men
were
slaying
and
maidens
danced
till
i
who
listened
lay
still
entranced
then
swift
as
a
swallow
heading
south
i
kissed
your
mouth
one
night
when
the
plains
were
bathed
in
blood
from
sunset
light
in
a
crimson
flood
we
wandered
under
the
young
teak
trees
whose
branches
whined
in
the
light
night
breeze
you
led
me
down
to
the
water
brink
the
spring
where
the
panthers
come
to
drink
at
night
there
is
always
water
here
be
the
season
never
so
parched
and
sere
have
we
souls
of
beasts
in
the
forms
of
men
i
fain
would
have
tasted
your
then
the
night
fell
swiftly
this
sudden
land
can
never
lend
us
a
twilight
strand
the
daylight
shore
and
the
ocean
night
but
takes
as
it
gives
at
once
the
light
we
laid
us
down
on
the
steep
hillside
while
far
below
us
wild
peacocks
cried
and
we
sometimes
heard
in
the
sunburnt
grass
the
stealthy
steps
of
the
jungle
pass
we
listened
knew
not
whether
they
went
on
love
or
hunger
the
more
intent
and
under
your
kisses
i
hardly
knew
whether
i
loved
or
hated
you
but
your
words
were
flame
and
your
kisses
fire
and
who
shall
resist
a
strong
desire
not
i
whose
life
is
a
broken
boat
on
a
sea
of
passions
adrift
afloat
and
whether
i
came
in
love
or
hate
that
i
came
to
you
was
written
by
fate
in
every
hue
of
the
sky
in
every
tone
of
the
peacocks
cry
while
every
gust
of
the
jungle
night
was
fanning
the
flame
you
had
set
alight
for
these
things
have
power
to
stir
the
blood
and
compel
us
all
to
their
own
chance
mood
and
to
love
or
not
we
are
no
more
free
than
a
ripple
to
rise
and
leave
the
sea
we
are
ever
and
always
slaves
of
these
of
the
suns
that
scorch
and
the
winds
that
freeze
of
the
faint
sweet
scents
of
the
sultry
air
of
the
half
heard
howl
from
the
far
off
lair
these
chance
things
master
us
ever
compel
to
the
heights
of
heaven
the
depths
of
hell
whether
i
love
you
you
do
not
ask
nor
waste
yourself
on
the
thankless
task
i
give
your
kisses
at
least
return
what
matter
whether
they
freeze
or
burn
i
feel
the
strength
of
your
fervent
arms
what
matter
whether
it
heals
or
harms
you
are
wise
you
take
what
the
gods
have
sent
you
ask
no
question
but
rest
content
so
i
am
with
you
to
take
your
kiss
and
perhaps
i
value
you
more
for
this
for
this
is
wisdom
to
love
to
live
to
take
what
fate
or
the
gods
may
give
to
ask
no
question
to
make
no
prayer
to
kiss
the
lips
and
caress
the
hair
speed
passion
ebb
as
you
greet
its
flow
to
have
to
hold
and
in
time
let
go
and
this
is
our
wisdom
we
rest
together
on
the
great
lone
hills
in
the
weather
and
watch
the
skies
as
they
pale
and
burn
the
golden
stars
in
their
orbits
turn
while
love
is
with
us
and
time
and
peace
and
life
has
nothing
to
give
but
these
but
whether
you
love
me
who
shall
say
or
whether
you
drifting
down
my
way
in
the
great
sad
river
of
chance
and
change
with
your
looks
so
weary
and
words
so
strange
lit
my
soul
from
some
hidden
flame
to
a
passionate
longing
without
a
name
who
shall
say
not
i
who
am
but
a
broken
boat
content
for
a
while
to
drift
afloat
in
the
little
noontide
of
love
delights
between
two
nights
valgovind
boat
song
waters
glisten
and
sunbeams
quiver
the
wind
blows
fresh
and
free
take
my
boat
to
your
breast
o
river
carry
me
out
to
sea
this
land
is
laden
with
fruit
and
grain
with
never
a
place
left
free
for
flowers
a
fruitful
mother
but
i
am
fain
for
brides
in
their
early
bridal
hours
take
my
boat
to
your
breast
o
river
carry
me
out

the

beloved
by
a
thousand
ships
is

ever
and
fresh
and

ah
for
the
touch
of
her
cool
green
lips
carry
me
out

take
my
boat
to
your
breast
dear

and

kashmiri
song
by
juma
you
never
loved
me
and
yet
to
save
me
one
unforgetable
night
you
gave
me
such
chill
embraces
as
the
heights
receive
from
clouds
in
northern
auroral
nights
such
keen
communion
as
the
frozen
mere
has
with
immaculate
moonlight
cold
and
clear
and
all
desire
like
failing
fire
died
slowly
faded
surely
and
sank
to
rest
against
the
delicate
chillness
of
your
breast
zira
in
captivity
love
me
a
little
lord
or
let
me
go
i
am
so
weary
walking
to
and
fro
through
all
your
lonely
halls
that
were
so
sweet
did
they
but
echo
to
your
coming
feet
when
by
the
flowered
scrolls
of
stone
our
women
windows
i
am
left
alone
across
the
yellow
desert
looking
forth
i
see
the
purple
hills
towards
the
north
behind
those
jagged
mountains
lilac
crest
once
lay
the
captive
bird
small
rifled
nest
there
was
my
brother
slain
my
sister
bound
his
blood
her
tears
drunk
by
the
thirsty
ground
then
while
the
burning
village
smoked
on
high
and
desecrated
all
the
peaceful
sky
they
took
us
captive
us
born
frank
and
free
on
fleet
strong
camels
through
the
sandy
sea
yet
when
we
rested
on
the
sand
by
the
rare
waters
of
this
dreary
land
our
captors
ere
the
camp
was
wrapped
in
sleep
talked
and
i
listened
and
forgot
to
weep
is
he
not
brave
and
fair
they
asked
our
king
slender
as
one
tall
by
a
spring
erect
serene
with
gravely
brilliant
eyes
as
deeply
dark
as
are
these
desert
skies
truly
no
bitter
fate
they
said
and
smiled
awaits
the
beauty
of
this
captured
child
then
something
in
my
heart
began
to
sing
and
secretly
i
longed
to
see
the
king
sometimes
the
other
maidens
sat
in
tears
sometimes
consoled
they
jested
at
their
fears
musing
what
lovers
time
to
them
would
bring
but
i
was
silent
thinking
of
the
king
till
when
the
weary
endless
sands
were
passed
when
far
to
south
the
city
rose
at
last
all
speech
forsook
me
and
my
eyelids
fell
since
i
already
loved
my
lord
so
well
then
the
division
some
were
sent
away
to
merchants
in
the
city
some
they
say
to
summer
palaces
beyond
the
walls
but
me
they
took
straight
to
the
sultan
halls
every
morning
i
would
wake
and
say
ah
sisters
shall
i
see
our
lord
the
women
robed
me
perfumed
me
and
smiled
when
were
his
feet
unfleet
to
pleasure
child
and
tales
they
told
me
of
his
deeds
in
war
of
how
his
name
was
reverenced
afar
and
crouching
closer
in
the
lamp
faint
glow
they
told
me
of
his
beauty
speaking
low
what
need
what
need
the
women
wasted
art
i
love
you
with
every
fibre
of
my
heart
already
my
god
when
did
i
love
you
in
life
in
death
when
shall
i
not
love
you
you
never
seek
me
all
day
long
i
lie
watching
the
changes
of
the
sky
behind
the
of
carven
stone
and
all
night
long
alas
i
lie
alone
but
you
come
never
ah
my
lord
the
king
how
can
you
find
it
well
to
do
this
thing
come
once
come
only
sometimes
as
i
lie
i
doubt
if
i
shall
see
you
first
or
die
ah
could
i
hear
your
footsteps
at
the
door
hallow
the
lintel
and
caress
the
floor
then
i
might
drink
your
beauty
satisfied
die
of
delight
ere
you
could
reach
my
side
alas
you
come
not
lord
life
flame
burns
low
faint
for
a
loveliness
it
may
not
know
faint
for
your
face
oh
come
come
soon
to
me
lest
though
you
should
not
death
should
set
me
free
marriage
thoughts
by
morsellin
khan
i
give
you
my
house
and
my
lands
all
golden
with
harvest
my
sword
my
shield
and
my
jewels
the
spoils
of
my
strife
my
strength
and
my
dreams
and
aught
i
have
gathered
of
glory
and
i
shall
give
you
my
very
life
i
may
not
raise
my
eyes
o
my
lord
towards
you
and
i
may
not
speak
what
matter
my
voice
would
fail
but
through
my
downcast
lashes
feeling
your
beauty
i
shiver
and
burn
with
pleasure
beneath
my
veil
we
throw
sweet
perfume
upon
her
head
and
delicate
flowers
round
her
bed
ah
would
that
it
were
our
turn
to
wed
i
see
my
daughter
vaguely
through
my
tears
ah
lost
caresses
of
my
early
years
i
see
the
bridegroom
king
of
men
in
truth
ah
my
first
lover
and
my
vanished
youth
almost
i
dread
this
night
my
senses
fail
me
how
shall
i
dare
to
clasp
a
thing
so
dear
many
have
feared
your
name
but
i
your
beauty
lord
of
my
life
be
gentle
to
my
fear
in
the
softest
silk
is
our
sister
dressed
with
silver
rubies
upon
her
breast
where
a
dearer
treasure
will
rest
see
his
hair
is
like
silk
and
his
teeth
are
whiter
than
whitest
of
jasmin
flowers
pity
they
marry
him
thus
i
would
change
my
jewels
against
his
caresses
verily
sisters
this
marriage
is
greatly
a
loss
to
us
would
that
the
music
ceased
and
the
night
drew
round
us
with
solitude
shadow
and
sound
of
closing
doors
so
that
our
lips
might
meet
and
our
beings
mingle
while
mine
drank
deep
of
the
essence
beloved
of
yours
out
of
the
joy
of
your
marriage
feast
oh
brothers
be
good
to
me
the
way
is
long
and
the
shrine
is
far
where
my
weary
feet
would
be
and
feasting
is
always
somewhat
sad
to
those
outside
the
door
still
love
is
only
a
dream
and
life
itself
is
hardly
more
to
the
unattainable
lament
of
mahomed
akram
i
would
have
taken
golden
stars
from
the
sky
for
your
necklace
i
would
have
shaken
for
your
rest
from
all
the
but
you
had
no
need
the
short
sweet
grass
sufficed
for
your
slumber
and
you
took
no
heed
of
such
trifles
as
gold
or
a
necklace
there
is
an
hour
at
twilight
too
heavy
with
memory
there
is
a
flower
that
i
fear
for
your
hair
had
its
fragrance
i
would
have
squandered
youth
for
you
and
its
hope
and
its
promise
before
you
wandered
careless
away
from
my
useless
passion
but
what
is
the
use
of
my
speech
since
i
know
of
no
words
to
recall
you
i
am
praying
that
time
may
teach
you
your
cruelty
me
forgetfulness
mahomed
akram
appeal
to
the
stars
oh
silver
stars
that
shine
on
what
i
love
touch
the
soft
hair
and
sparkle
in
the
eyes
send
from
your
calm
serenity
above
sleep
to
whom
sleepless
here
despairing
lies
broken
forlorn
upon
the
desert
sand
that
sucks
these
tears
and
utterly
abased
looking
across
the
lonely
level
land
with
thoughts
more
desolate
than
any
waste
planets
that
shine
on
what
i
so
adore
now
thrown
the
hour
is
late
in
careless
rest
protect
that
sleep
which
i
may
watch
no
more
i
the
cast
out
dismissed
and
dispossessed
far
in
the
hillside
camp
in
slumber
lies
what
my
worn
eyes
worship
but
never
see
happier
stars
your
myriad
silver
eyes
feast
on
the
quiet
face
denied
to
me
loved
with
a
love
beyond
all
words
or
sense
lost
with
a
grief
beyond
the
saltest
tear
so
lovely
so
removed
remote
and
hence
so
doubly
and
so
desperately
dear
stars
from
your
skies
so
purple
and
so
calm
that
through
the
centuries
your
secrets
keep
send
to
this
brain
some
occult
balm
send
me
for
many
nights
so
sleepless
sleep
and
ere
the
sunshine
of
the
desert
jars
my
sense
with
sorrow
and
another
day
through
your
soft
magic
oh
my
silver
stars
turn
sleep
to
death
in
some
mysterious
way
reminiscence
of
mahomed
akram
i
shall
never
forget
you
never
never
escape
your
memory
woven
about
the
beautiful
things
of
life
the
sudden
thought
of
your
face
is
like
a
wound
when
it
comes
unsought
on
some
scent
of
jasmin
lilies
or
pale
tuberose
any
one
of
the
sweet
white
fragrant
flowers
flowers
i
used
to
love
and
lay
in
your
hair
sunset
is
terribly
sad
i
saw
you
stand
tall
against
the
red
and
the
gold
like
a
slender
palm
the
light
wind
stirred
your
hair
as
you
waved
your
hand
waved
farewell
as
ever
serene
and
calm
to
me
the
and
tost
and
torn
riding
down
the
road
in
the
gathering
grey
since
that
day
the
sunset
red
is
empty
the
gold
forlorn
often
across
the
banqueting
board
at
nights
men
linger
about
your
name
in
careless
praise
the
name
that
cuts
deep
into
my
soul
like
a
knife
and
the
gay
and
flowers
and
leaves
and
lights
fade
away
from
the
failing
sense
in
a
haze
and
the
music
sways
far
away
in
unmeasured
distance
i
can
not
forget
i
can
not
escape
what
are
the
stars
to
me
stars
that
meant
so
much
too
much
in
my
youth
stars
that
sparkled
about
your
eyes
made
a
radiance
round
your
hair
what
are
they
now
lingering
lights
of
a
finished
feast
little
lingering
sparks
rather
of
a
light
that
is
long
gone
out
story
by
the
priest
he
loved
the
plant
with
a
keen
delight
a
passionate
fervour
strange
to
see
tended
it
ardently
day
and
night
yet
never
a
flower
lit
up
the
tree
the
leaves
were
succulent
thick
and
green
and
sessile
out
of
the
snakelike
stem
rose
fingers
alert
and
keen
to
catch
at
aught
that
molested
them
but
though
they
nurtured
it
day
and
night
with
love
and
labour
the
child
and
he
were
never
granted
the
sight
of
a
flower
crowning
the
twisted
tree
until
one
evening
a
wayworn
priest
stopped
for
the
night
in
the
temple
shade
and
shared
the
fare
of
their
simple
feast
under
the
vines
and
the
jasmin
laid
he
later
wandering
round
the
flowers
paused
awhile
by
the
blossomless
tree
the
man
said
may
it
be
fault
of
ours
that
never
its
buds
my
eyes
may
see
aslip
it
came
from
the
further
east
many
a
sunlit
summer
ago
it
grows
in
our
jungles
said
the
priest
men
see
it
rarely
but
this
i
know
the
jungle
people
worship
it
say
they
bury
a
child
around
its
roots
bury
it
living
the
only
way
to
crimson
glory
of
flowers
and
fruits
he
spoke
in
whispers
his
furtive
glance
probing
the
depths
of
the
garden
shade
the
man
came
closer
with
eyes
askance
the
child
beside
them
shivered
afraid
a
cold
wind
drifted
about
the
three
jarring
the
spines
with
a
hungry
sound
the
spines
that
grew
on
the
snakelike
tree
and
guarded
its
roots
beneath
the
ground
after
the
fall
of
the
summer
rain
the
plant
was
glorious
redly
gay
with
blossom
never
again
men
saw
the
child
in
the
temple
play
request
give
me
your
self
one
hour
i
do
not
crave
for
any
love
or
even
thought
of
me
come
as
a
sultan
may
caress
a
slave
and
then
forget
for
ever
utterly
come
as
west
winds
that
passing
cool
and
wet
desert
places
leave
them
fields
in
flower
and
all
my
life
for
i
shall
not
forget
will
keep
the
fragrance
of
that
perfect
hour
story
of
udaipore
told
by
the
priest
and
when
the
summer
heat
is
great
and
every
hour
intense
the
moghra
with
its
subtle
flowers
intoxicates
the
sense
the
coco
palms
stood
tall
and
slim
against
the
and
all
their
grey
and
graceful
plumes
were
waving
to
and
fro
she
lay
forgetful
in
the
boat
and
watched
the
dying
sun
sink
slowly
lakewards
while
the
stars
replaced
him
one
by
one
she
saw
the
marble
temple
walls
long
white
reflections
make
the
echoes
of
their
silvery
bells
were
blown
across
the
lake
the
evening
air
was
very
sweet
from
off
the
island
bowers
came
scents
of
moghra
trees
in
bloom
and
oleander
flowers
the
moghra
flowers
that
smell
so
sweet
when
love
young
fancies
play
the
acrid
moghra
flowers
still
sweet
though
love
be
burnt
away
the
boat
went
drifting
uncontrolled
the
rower
rowed
no
more
but
deftly
turned
the
slender
prow
towards
the
further
shore
the
dying
sunset
touched
with
gold
the
jasmin
in
his
hair
his
eyes
were
darkly
luminous
she
looked
and
found
him
fair
and
so
persuasively
he
spoke
she
could
not
say
him
nay
and
when
his
young
hands
took
her
own
she
smiled
and
let
them
stay
and
all
the
youth
awake
in
him
all
love
of
love
in
her
all
scents
of
white
and
subtle
flowers
that
filled
the
twilight
air
combined
together
with
the
night
in
kind
conspiracy
to
do
love
service
while
the
boat
went
drifting
onwards
free
the
moghra
flowers
the
moghra
flowers
while
youth
quick
pulses
play
they
are
so
sweet
they
still
are
sweet
though
passion
burns
away
low
in
the
boat
the
lovers
lay
and
from
his
sable
curls
the
jasmin
flowers
slipped
away
to
rest
among
the
girl
oh
silver
lake
and
silver
night
and
tender
silver
sky
where
as
the
hours
passed
the
moon
rose
white
and
cold
on
high
the
moghra
flowers
the
moghra
flowers
so
dear
to
youth
at
play
the
small
and
subtle
moghra
flowers
that
only
last
a
day
suddenly
frightened
she
awoke
and
waking
vaguely
saw
the
boat
had
stranded
in
the
sedge
that
fringed
the
further
shore
the
breeze
grown
chilly
swayed
the
palms
she
heard
still
half
awake
a
prowling
jackal
hungry
cry
blown
faintly
the
lake
she
shivered
but
she
turned
to
kiss
his
soft
remembered
face
lit
by
the
pallid
light
he
lay
in
youth
abandoned
grace
but
as
her
lips
met
his
she
paused
in
terror
and
dismay
the
white
moon
showed
her
by
her
side
asleep
a
leper
lay
ah
moghra
flowers
white
moghra
flowers
all
love
is
blind
they
say
the
moghra
flowers
so
sweet
so
sweet
though
love
be
burnt
away
valgovind
song
in
the
spring
the
temple
bells
are
ringing
the
young
green
corn
is
springing
and
the
marriage
month
is
drawing
very
near
i
lie
hidden
in
the
grass
and
i
count
the
moments
pass
for
the
month
of
marriages
is
drawing
near
soon
ah
soon
the
women
spread
the
appointed
bridal
bed
with
hibiscus
buds
and
crimson
marriage
flowers
where
when
all
the
songs
are
done
and
the
dear
dark
night
begun
i
shall
hold
her
in
my
happy
arms
for
hours
she
is
young
and
very
sweet
from
the
silver
on
her
feet
to
the
silver
and
the
flowers
in
her
hair
and
her
beauty
makes
me
swoon
as
the
moghra
trees
at
noon
intoxicate
the
hot
and
quivering
air
ah
i
would
the
hours
were
fleet
as
her
silver
circled
feet
i
am
weary
of
the
daytime
and
the
night
i
am
weary
unto
death
oh
my
rose
with
jasmin
breath
with
this
longing
for
your
beauty
and
your
light
youth
i
am
not
sure
if
i
knew
the
truth
what
his
case
or
crime
might
be
i
only
know
that
he
pleaded
youth
a
beautiful
golden
plea
youth
with
its
sunlit
passionate
eyes
its
roseate
velvet
skin
a
plea
to
cancel
a
thousand
lies
or
a
thousand
nights
of
sin
the
men
who
judged
him
were
old
and
grey
their
eyes
and
their
senses
dim
he
brought
the
light
of
a
warm
spring
day
to
the
bare
and
grim
could
he
plead
guilty
in
a
lovelier
way
his
judges
acquitted
him
when
love
is
over
song
of
khan
zada
only
in
august
my
heart
was
aflame
catching
the
scent
of
your
hair
now
though
you
spread
it
to
soften
my
sleep
through
the
night
i
should
hardly
care
only
last
august
i
drank
that
water
because
it
had
chanced
to
cool
your
hands
when
love
is
over
how
little
of
love
even
the
lover
understands
golden
eyes
oh
amber
eyes
oh
golden
eyes
oh
eyes
so
softly
gay
wherein
swift
fancies
fall
and
rise
grow
dark
and
fade
away
eyes
like
a
little
limpid
pool
that
holds
a
sunset
sky
while
on
its
surface
calm
and
cool
blue
water
lilies
lie
oh
tender
eyes
oh
wistful
eyes
you
smiled
on
me
one
day
and
all
my
life
in
glad
surprise
leapt
up
and
pleaded
stay
alas
oh
cruel
starlike
eyes
so
grave
and
yet
so
gay
you
went
to
lighten
other
skies
smiled
once
and
passed
away
oh
you
whom
i
name
golden
eyes
perhaps
i
used
to
know
your
beauty
under
other
skies
in
lives
lived
long
ago
perhaps
i
rowed
with
galley
slaves
whose
labour
never
ceased
to
bring
across
phoenician
waves
your
treasure
from
the
east
maybe
you
were
an
emperor
then
and
i
a
favourite
slave
some
youth
whom
from
the
lions
den
you
vainly
tried
to
save
maybe
i
reigned
a
mighty
king
the
early
nations
knew
and
you
were
some
slight
captive
thing
some
maiden
whom
i
slew
perhaps
adrift
on
desert
shores
beside
some
shipwrecked
prow
i
gladly
gave
my
life
for
yours
would
i
might
give
it
now
or
on
some
sacrificial
stone
strange
gods
we
satisfied
perhaps
you
stooped
and
left
a
throne
to
kiss
me
ere
i
died
perhaps
still
further
back
than
this
in
times
ere
men
were
men
you
granted
me
a
moment
bliss
in
some
dark
desert
den
when
with
your
amber
eyes
alight
with
iridescent
flame
and
fierce
desire
for
love
delight
towards
my
lair
you
came
ah
laughing
eyes
these
things
men
may
not
know
but
something
in
your
radiance
lies
that
centuries
ago
lit
up
my
life
in
one
wild
blaze
of
infinite
desire
to
revel
in
your
golden
rays
or
in
your
light
expire
if
this
oh
strange
ringed
eyes
be
true
that
through
all
changing
lives
this
longing
love
i
have
for
you
eternally
survives
may
i
not
sometimes
dare
to
dream
in
some
far
time
to
be
your
softly
golden
eyes
may
gleam
responsively
on
me
ah
gentle
subtly
changing
eyes
you
smiled
on
me
one
day
and
all
my
life
in
glad
surprise
leaped
up
imploring
stay
alas
alas
oh
golden
eyes
so
cruel
and
so
gay
you
went
to
shine
in
other
skies
smiled
once
and
passed
away
kotri
by
the
river
at
kotri
by
the
river
when
the
evening
sun
is
low
the
waving
palm
trees
quiver
the
golden
waters
glow
the
shining
ripples
shiver
descending
to
the
sea
at
kotri
by
the
river
she
used
to
wait
for
me
so
young
she
was
and
slender
so
pale
with
wistful
eyes
as
luminous
and
tender
as
kotri
twilight
skies
her
face
broke
into
flowers
red
flowers
at
the
mouth
her
voice
she
sang
for
hours
like
bulbuls
in
the
south
we
sat
beside
the
water
through
burning
summer
days
and
many
things
i
taught
her
of
life
and
all
its
ways
of
love
man
loveliest
duty
of
passion
reckless
pain
of
youth
whose
transient
beauty
comes
once
but
not
again
she
lay
and
laughed
and
listened
beside
the
water
edge
the
glancing
river
glistened
and
glinted
through
the
sedge
green
parrots
flew
above
her
and
as
the
daylight
died
her
young
arms
drew
her
lover
more
closely
to
her
side
oh
days
so
warm
and
golden
oh
nights
so
cool
and
still
when
love
would
not
be
holden
and
pleasure
had
his
will
days
when
in
after
leisure
content
to
rest
we
lay
nights
when
her
lips
soft
pressure
drained
all
my
life
away
and
while
we
sat
together
beneath
the
babul
trees
the
fragrant
sultry
weather
cooled
by
the
river
breeze
if
passion
faltered
ever
and
left
the
senses
free
we
heard
the
tireless
river
decending
to
the
sea
i
know
not
where
she
wandered
or
went
in
after
days
or
if
her
youth
she
squandered
in
love
more
doubtful
ways
perhaps
beside
the
river
she
died
still
young
and
fair
perchance
the
grasses
quiver
above
her
slumber
there
at
kotri
by
the
river
maybe
i
too
shall
sleep
the
sleep
that
lasts
for
ever
too
deep
for
dreams
too
deep
maybe
among
the
shingle
and
sand
of
floods
to
be
her
dust
and
mine
may
mingle
and
float
away
to
sea
ah
kotri
by
the
river
when
evening
sun
is
low
your
faint
reflections
quiver
your
golden
ripples
glow
you
knew
oh
kotri
river
that
love
which
could
not
last
for
me
your
palms
still
shiver
with
passions
of
the
past
farewell
farewell
aziz
it
was
not
mine
to
fold
you
against
my
heart
for
any
length
of
days
i
had
no
loveliness
alas
to
hold
you
no
siren
voice
no
charm
that
lovers
praise
yet
in
the
midst
of
grief
and
desolation
solace
i
my
despairing
soul
with
this
once
for
my
life
eternal
consolation
you
lent
my
lips
your
loveliness
to
kiss
ah
that
one
night
i
think
love
very
essence
distilled
itself
from
out
my
joy
and
pain
like
tropical
trees
whose
fervid
inflorescence
glows
gleams
and
dies
never
to
bloom
again
often
i
marvel
how
i
met
the
morning
with
living
eyes
after
that
night
with
you
ah
how
i
cursed
the
wan
white
light
for
dawning
and
mourned
the
paling
stars
as
each
withdrew
yet
i
even
i
who
am
less
than
dust
before
you
less
than
the
lowest
lintel
of
your
door
was
given
one
breathless
midnight
to
adore
you
fate
having
granted
this
can
give
no
more
afridi
love
since
oh
beloved
you
are
not
even
faithful
to
me
who
loved
you
so
for
one
short
night
for
one
brief
space
of
darkness
though
my
absence
did
but
endure
until
the
dawning
light
since
all
your
beauty
which
was
you
squandered
on
which
now
lies
dead
across
your
door
see
here
this
knife
made
keen
and
bright
to
kill
you
you
shall
not
see
the
sun
rise
any
more
lie
still
lie
still
in
all
the
empty
village
who
is
there
left
to
hear
or
heed
your
cry
all
are
gone
to
labour
in
the
valley
who
will
return
before
your
time
to
die
no
use
to
struggle
when
i
found
you
sleeping
i
took
your
hands
and
bound
them
to
your
side
and
both
these
slender
feet
too
apt
at
straying
down
to
the
cot
on
which
you
lie
are
tied
lie
still
beloved
that
dead
thing
lying
yonder
i
hated
and
i
killed
but
love
is
sweet
and
you
are
more
than
sweet
to
me
who
love
you
who
decked
my
eyes
with
dust
from
off
your
feet
give
me
your
lips
ah
lovely
and
disloyal
give
me
yourself
again
before
you
go
down
through
the
darkness
of
the
great
blind
portal
all
of
life
best
and
basest
you
must
know
erstwhile
beloved
you
were
so
young
and
fragile
i
held
you
gently
as
one
holds
a
flower
but
now
god
knows
what
use
to
still
be
tender
to
one
whose
life
is
done
within
an
hour
i
hurt
what
then
death
will
not
hurt
you
dearest
as
you
hurt
me
for
just
a
single
night
you
call
me
cruel
who
laid
my
life
in
ruins
to
gain
one
little
moment
of
delight
look
up
look
out
across
the
open
doorway
the
sunlight
streams
the
distant
hills
are
blue
look
at
the
pale
pink
peach
trees
in
our
garden
sweet
fruit
will
come
of
them
but
not
for
you
the
fair
far
snow
upon
those
jagged
mountains
that
gnaw
against
the
hard
blue
afghan
sky
will
soon
descend
set
free
by
summer
sunshine
you
will
not
see
those
torrents
sweeping
by
the
world
is
not
for
you
from
this
day
forward
you
must
lie
still
alone
who
would
not
lie
alone
for
one
night
only
though
returning
i
was
when
earliest
dawn
should
break
the
sky
there
lies
my
lute
and
many
strings
are
broken
some
one
was
playing
it
and
some
one
tore
the
silken
tassels
round
my
hookah
woven
some
one
who
plays
and
smokes
and
loves
no
more
some
one
who
took
last
night
his
fill
of
pleasure
as
i
took
mine
at
dawn
the
knife
went
home
straight
through
his
heart
god
only
knows
my
rapture
bathing
my
chill
hands
in
the
warm
red
foam
and
so
i
pain
you
this
is
only
loving
wait
till
i
kill
you
ah
this
soft
curled
hair
surely
the
fault
was
mine
to
love
and
leave
you
even
a
single
night
you
are
so
fair
cold
steel
is
very
cooling
to
the
fervour
of
over
passionate
ones
beloved
like
you
nay
turn
your
lips
to
mine
not
quite
unlovely
they
are
as
yet
as
yet
though
quite
untrue
what
will
your
brother
say
returning
with
laden
camels
homewards
to
the
hills
finding
you
dead
and
me
asleep
beside
you
will
he
awake
me
first
before
he
kills
for
i
shall
sleep
here
on
the
cot
beside
you
when
you
my
heart
delight
are
cold
in
death
when
your
young
heart
and
restless
lips
are
silent
grown
chilly
even
beneath
my
burning
breath
when
i
have
slowly
drawn
my
knife
across
you
taking
my
pleasure
as
i
see
you
swoon
i
shall
sleep
sound
worn
out
by
love
last
fervour
and
then
god
grant
your
kinsmen
kill
me
soon
yasmini
at
night
when
passion
ebbing
tide
left
bare
the
sands
of
truth
yasmini
resting
by
my
side
spoke
softly
of
her
youth
and
one
she
said
was
tall
and
slim
two
crimson
rose
leaves
made
his
mouth
and
i
was
fain
to
follow
him
down
to
his
village
in
the
south
he
was
to
build
a
hut
hard
by
the
stream
where
palms
were
growing
we
were
to
live
and
love
and
lie
and
watch
the
water
flowing
ah
dear
delusive
distant
shore
by
dreams
of
futile
fancy
gilt
the
riverside
we
never
saw
the
palm
leaf
hut
was
never
built
one
had
a
tope
of
mangoe
trees
where
early
morning
noon
and
late
the
persian
wheels
with
patient
ease
brought
up
their
liquid
silver
freight
and
he
was
fain
to
rise
and
reach
that
garden
sloping
to
the
sea
whose
groves
along
the
beach
should
shelter
him
and
love
and
me
doubtless
upon
that
western
shore
with
ripe
fruit
falling
to
the
ground
there
dwells
the
peace
he
hungered
for
the
lovely
peace
we
never
found
then
there
came
one
with
eager
eyes
and
keen
sword
ready
for
the
fray
he
missed
the
storms
of
northern
skies
the
reckless
raid
and
skirmish
gay
he
rose
from
dreams
of
war
alarms
to
make
his
daggers
keen
and
bright
desiring
in
my
very
arms
the
fiercer
rapture
of
the
fight
he
left
me
soon
too
soon
and
sought
the
stronger
earlier
love
again
news
reached
me
from
the
cabul
court
afterwards
nothing
doubtless
slain
doubtless
his
brilliant
haggard
eyes
long
since
took
leave
of
life
and
light
and
those
lithe
limbs
i
used
to
prize
feasted
the
jackal
and
the
kite
but
the
most
loved
his
sixteen
years
shone
in
his
cheeks
transparent
red
my
kisses
were
his
first
my
tears
fell
on
his
face
when
he
was
dead
he
died
he
died
i
speak
the
truth
though
light
love
leave
his
memory
dim
he
was
the
lover
of
my
youth
and
all
my
youth
went
down
with
him
for
passion
ebbs
and
passion
flows
but
under
every
new
caress
the
riven
heart
more
keenly
knows
its
own
inviolate
faithfulness
our
gods
are
kind
and
still
deem
fit
as
in
old
days
with
those
to
lie
whose
silent
hearths
are
yet
unlit
by
the
soft
light
of
infancy
therefore
one
strange
mysterious
night
alone
within
the
temple
shade
recipient
of
a
god
delight
i
lay
enraptured
unafraid
also
to
me
the
boon
was
given
but
mourning
quickly
followed
mirth
my
son
whose
father
stooped
from
heaven
died
in
the
moment
of
his
birth
when
from
the
war
beyond
the
seas
the
reckless
lancers
home
returned
their
spoils
were
laid
across
my
knees
about
my
lips
their
kisses
burned
back
from
the
comradeship
of
death
free
from
the
friendship
of
the
sword
with
brilliant
eyes
and
famished
breath
they
came
to
me
for
their
reward
why
do
i
tell
you
all
these
things
baring
my
life
to
you
unsought
when
passion
folds
his
wearied
wings
sleep
should
be
follower
never
thought
ay
let
us
sleep
the
window
pane
grows
pale
against
the
purple
sky
the
dawn
is
with
us
once
again
the
dawn
which
always
means
within
her
little
trellised
room
beside
the
sea
she
wakeful
in
the
scented
gloom
spoke
of
her
youth
to
me
ojira
to
her
lover
i
am
waiting
in
the
desert
looking
out
towards
the
sunset
and
counting
every
moment
till
we
meet
i
am
waiting
by
the
marshes
and
i
tremble
and
i
listen
till
the
soft
sands
thrill
beneath
your
coming
feet
till
i
see
you
tall
and
slender
standing
clear
against
the
skyline
a
graceful
shade
across
the
lingering
red
while
your
hair
the
breezes
ruffle
turns
to
silver
in
the
twilight
and
makes
a
fair
faint
aureole
round
your
head
far
away
towards
the
sunset
i
can
see
a
narrow
river
that
unwinds
itself
in
red
tranquillity
i
can
hear
its
rippled
meeting
and
the
gurgle
of
its
greeting
as
it
mingles
with
the
loved
and
long
sought
sea
in
the
purple
sky
above
me
showing
dark
against
the
starlight
long
wavering
flights
of
homeward
birds
fly
low
they
cry
each
one
to
the
other
and
their
weird
and
wistful
calling
makes
most
melancholy
music
as
they
go
oh
my
dearest
hasten
hasten
it
is
lonely
here
already
have
i
heard
the
jackals
first
assembling
cry
and
among
the
purple
shadows
of
the
mangroves
and
the
marshes
fitful
echoes
of
their
footfalls
passing
by
ah
come
soon
my
arms
are
empty
and
so
weary
for
your
beauty
i
am
thirsty
for
the
music
of
your
voice
come
to
make
the
marshes
joyous
with
the
sweetness
of
your
presence
let
your
nearing
feet
bid
all
the
sands
rejoice
my
hands
my
lips
are
feverish
with
the
longing
and
the
waiting
and
no
softness
of
the
twilight
soothes
their
heat
till
i
see
your
radiant
eyes
shining
stars
beneath
the
starlight
till
i
kiss
the
slender
coolness
of
your
feet
ah
loveliest
most
reluctant
when
you
lay
yourself
beside
me
all
the
planets
reel
around
me
fade
away
and
the
sands
grow
dim
uncertain
i
stretch
out
my
hands
towards
you
while
i
try
to
speak
but
know
not
what
i
say
i
am
faint
with
love
and
longing
and
my
burning
eyes
are
gazing
where
the
furtive
jackals
wage
their
famished
strife
oh
your
shadow
on
the
mangroves
and
your
step
upon
the
sandhills
this
is
the
loveliest
evening
of
my
life
thoughts
mahomed
akram
if
some
day
this
body
of
mine
were
burned
it
found
no
favour
alas
with
you
and
the
ashes
scattered
abroad
unurned
would
love
die
also
would
thought
die
too
but
who
can
answer
or
who
can
trust
no
dreams
would
harry
the
windblown
dust
were
i
laid
away
in
the
furrows
deep
secure
from
jackal
and
passing
plough
would
your
eyes
not
follow
me
still
through
sleep
torment
me
then
as
they
torture
now
would
you
ever
have
loved
me
golden
eyes
had
i
done
aught
better
or
otherwise
was
i
overspeechful
or
did
you
yearn
when
i
sat
silent
for
songs
or
speech
ah
beloved
i
had
been
so
apt
to
learn
so
apt
had
you
only
cared
to
teach
but
time
for
silence
and
song
is
done
you
wanted
nothing
my
golden
sun
what
should
you
want
of
a
waning
star
that
drifts
in
its
lonely
orbit
far
away
from
your
soft
effulgent
light
in
outer
planes
of
eternal
night
prayer
you
are
all
that
is
lovely
and
light
aziza
whom
i
adore
and
waking
after
the
night
i
am
weary
with
dreams
of
you
every
nerve
in
my
heart
is
tense
and
sore
as
i
rise
to
another
morning
apart
from
you
i
dream
of
your
luminous
eyes
aziza
whom
i
adore
of
the
ruffled
silk
of
your
hair
i
dream
and
the
dreams
are
lies
but
i
love
them
knowing
no
more
will
ever
be
mine
of
you
aziza
my
life
despair
i
would
burn
for
a
thousand
days
aziza
whom
i
adore
be
tortured
slain
in
unheard
of
ways
if
you
pitied
the
pain
i
bore
you
pity
your
bright
eyes
fastened
on
other
things
are
keener
to
sting
my
soul
than
scorpion
stings
you
are
all
that
is
lovely
to
me
all
that
is
light
one
white
rose
in
a
desert
of
weariness
i
only
live
in
the
night
the
night
with
its
fair
false
dreams
of
you
you
and
your
loveliness
give
me
your
love
for
a
day
a
night
an
hour
if
the
wages
of
sin
are
death
i
am
willing
to
pay
what
is
my
life
but
a
breath
of
passion
burning
away
away
for
an
unplucked
flower
o
aziza
whom
i
adore
aziza
my
one
delight
only
one
night
i
will
die
before
day
and
trouble
your
life
no
more
the
aloe
my
life
was
like
an
aloe
flower
beneath
an
orient
sky
your
sunshine
touched
it
for
an
hour
it
blossomed
but
to
die
torn
up
cast
out
on
rubbish
heaps
where
red
flames
work
their
will
each
atom
of
the
aloe
keeps
the
fragrance
still
memory
how
i
loved
you
in
your
sleep
with
the
starlight
on
your
hair
the
touch
of
your
lips
was
sweet
aziza
whom
i
adore
i
lay
at
your
slender
feet
and
against
their
soft
palms
pressed
i
fitted
my
face
to
rest
as
winds
blow
over
the
sea
from
citron
gardens
ashore
came
through
your
scented
hair
the
breeze
of
the
night
to
me
my
lips
grew
arid
and
dry
my
nerves
were
tense
though
your
beauty
soothe
the
eye
it
maddens
the
sense
every
curve
of
that
beauty
is
known
to
me
every
tint
of
that
delicate
roseleaf
skin
and
these
are
printed
on
every
atom
of
me
burnt
in
on
every
fibre
until
i
die
and
for
this
my
sin
i
doubt
if
ever
though
dust
i
be
the
dust
will
lose
the
desire
the
torment
and
hidden
fire
of
my
passionate
love
for
you
aziza
whom
i
adore
my
dust
will
be
full
of
your
beauty
as
is
the
blue
and
infinite
ocean
full
of
the
azure
sky
in
the
light
that
waxed
and
waned
playing
about
your
slumber
in
silver
bars
as
the
palm
trees
swung
their
feathery
fronds
athwart
the
stars
how
quiet
and
young
you
were
pale
as
the
champa
flowers
violet
veined
that
sweet
and
fading
lay
in
your
loosened
hair
how
sweet
you
were
in
your
sleep
with
the
starlight
on
your
hair
your
throat
thrown
backwards
bare
and
touched
with
circling
moonbeams
silver
white
on
the
couch
sombre
shade
o
aziza
my
one
delight
when
youth
passionate
pulses
fade
and
his
golden
heart
beats
slow
when
across
the
infinite
sky
i
see
the
roseate
glow
of
my
last
last
sunset
flare
i
shall
send
my
thoughts
to
this
night
and
remember
you
as
i
die
the
one
thing
among
all
the
things
of
this
earth
found
fair
how
sweet
you
were
in
your
sleep
with
the
starlight
silver
and
sable
across
your
hair
the
first
lover
as
the
vessel
side
she
leant
she
saw
the
swimmer
in
the
sea
with
eager
eyes
on
her
intent
come
down
come
down
and
swim
with
me
so
weary
was
she
of
her
lot
tired
of
the
ship
monotony
she
straightway
all
the
world
forgot
save
the
young
swimmer
in
the
sea
so
when
the
dusky
dying
light
left
all
the
water
dark
and
dim
she
softly
in
the
friendly
night
slipped
down
the
vessel
side
to
him
intent
and
brilliant
brightly
dark
she
saw
his
burning
eager
eyes
and
many
a
phosphorescent
spark
about
his
shoulders
fall
and
rise
as
through
the
hushed
and
eastern
night
they
swam
together
hand
in
hand
or
lay
and
laughed
in
sheer
delight
full
length
upon
the
level
sand
ah
soft
delusive
purple
night
whose
darkness
knew
no
vexing
moon
ah
cruel
needless
dawning
light
that
trembled
in
the
sky
too
soon
khan
zada
song
on
the
hillside
the
fires
that
burn
on
all
the
hills
light
up
the
landscape
grey
the
arid
desert
land
distills
the
fervours
of
the
day
the
clear
white
moon
sails
through
the
skies
and
silvers
all
the
night
i
see
the
brilliance
of
your
eyes
and
need
no
other
light
the
death
sighs
of
a
thousand
flowers
the
fervent
day
has
slain
are
wafted
through
the
twilight
hours
and
perfume
all
the
plain
my
senses
strain
and
try
to
clasp
their
sweetness
in
the
air
in
vain
in
vain
they
only
grasp
the
fragrance
of
your
hair
the
plain
is
endless
space
expressed
vast
is
the
sky
above
i
only
feel
against
your
breast
infinities
of
love
deserted
gipsy
song
hillside
camp
she
is
glad
to
receive
your
turquoise
ring
dear
and
lover
of
mine
i
to
have
given
you
everything
beauty
maddens
the
soul
like
wine
she
is
proud
to
have
held
aloof
her
charms
slender
lover
of
mine
but
i
of
the
night
you
lay
in
my
arms
beauty
maddens
the
sense
like
wine
she
triumphs
to
think
that
your
heart
is
won
stately
lover
of
mine
i
had
not
a
thought
of
myself
not
one
beauty
maddens
the
brain
like
wine
she
will
speak
you
softly
while
skies
are
blue
dear
deluded
lover
of
mine
i
would
lose
both
body
and
soul
for
you
beauty
maddens
the
brain
like
wine
while
the
ways
are
fair
she
will
love
you
well
dear
disdainful
lover
of
mine
but
i
would
have
followed
you
down
to
hell
beauty
maddens
the
soul
like
wine
though
you
lay
at
her
feet
the
days
to
be
now
no
longer
lover
of
mine
you
can
give
her
naught
that
you
gave
not
me
beauty
maddened
my
soul
like
wine
when
the
years
have
shown
what
is
false
or
true
beauty
maddens
the
sight
like
wine
you
will
understand
how
i
cared
for
you
first
and
only
lover
of
mine
the
plains
how
one
loves
them
these
wide
horizons
whether
desert
or
sea
vague
and
vast
and
infinite
faintly
clear
surely
hid
in
the
far
away
unknown
there
lie
the
things
so
longed
for
and
found
not
found
not
here
only
where
some
passionate
level
land
stretches
itself
in
reaches
of
golden
sand
only
where
the
sea
line
is
joined
to
the
clear
beyond
the
curve
of
ripple
or
white
foamed
crest
shall
the
weary
eyes
distressed
by
the
broken
skies
broken
by
minaret
mountain
or
towering
tree
shall
the
weary
eyes
be
assuaged
be
assuaged
and
rest
lost
delight
after
the
hazara
war
i
lie
alone
beneath
the
almond
blossoms
where
we
two
lay
together
in
the
spring
and
now
as
then
the
mountain
snows
are
melting
this
year
as
last
the
sing
that
was
another
spring
and
other
flowers
hung
pink
and
fragile
on
the
leafless
tree
the
land
rejoiced
in
other
running
water
and
i
rejoiced
because
you
were
with
me
you
with
your
soft
eyes
darkly
lashed
and
shaded
your
red
lips
like
a
living
laughing
rose
your
restless
amber
limbs
so
lithe
and
slender
now
lost
to
me
gone
whither
no
man
knows
you
lay
beside
me
singing
in
the
sunshine
the
rough
white
fur
unloosened
at
the
neck
showed
the
smooth
skin
fair
as
the
almond
blossoms
on
which
the
sun
could
find
no
flaw
or
fleck
i
lie
alone
beneath
the
almond
flowers
i
hated
them
to
touch
you
as
they
fell
and
now
who
killed
you
worse
ah
worse
who
loves
you
my
soul
is
burning
as
men
burn
in
hell
how
i
have
sought
you
in
the
crowded
cities
i
have
been
mad
they
say
for
many
days
i
know
not
how
i
came
here
to
the
valley
what
fate
has
led
me
through
what
doubtful
ways
somewhere
i
see
my
sword
has
done
good
service
some
one
i
killed
who
smiling
used
your
name
but
in
what
country
nay
i
have
forgotten
all
thought
is
shrivelled
in
my
heart
hot
flame
where
are
you
now
delight
and
where
your
beauty
your
subtle
curls
and
laughing
changeful
face
bound
bruised
and
naked
dear
god
grant
me
patience
and
sold
in
cabul
in
the
i
asked
of
you
of
all
men
who
could
tell
me
among
so
many
captured
sold
or
slain
what
fate
was
yours
ah
dear
god
grant
me
patience
my
heart
is
burnt
is
burnt
with
fire
and
pain
oh
lost
delight
my
heart
is
almost
breaking
my
sword
is
broken
and
my
feet
are
sore
the
people
look
at
me
and
say
in
passing
he
will
not
leave
the
village
any
more
for
as
the
evening
falls
the
fever
rises
with
frantic
thoughts
careering
through
the
brain
wild
thoughts
of
you
ah
dear
god
grant
me
patience
my
soul
is
hurt
beyond
all
men
call
pain
i
lie
alone
beneath
the
almond
blossoms
and
see
the
white
snow
melting
on
the
hills
till
khorassan
is
gay
with
glad
with
the
tinkling
sound
of
running
rills
and
well
i
know
that
when
the
fragile
petals
fall
softly
ere
the
first
green
leaves
appear
ah
for
these
last
few
days
god
grant
me
patience
since
delight
is
not
i
shall
not
be
here
unforgotten
do
you
ever
think
of
me
you
who
died
ere
our
youth
first
fervour
chilled
with
your
soft
eyes
and
your
pulses
stilled
lying
alone
aside
do
you
ever
think
of
me
left
in
the
light
from
the
endless
calm
of
your
dawnless
night
i
am
faithful
always
i
do
not
say
that
the
lips
which
thrilled
to
your
lips
of
old
to
lesser
kisses
are
always
cold
had
you
wished
for
this
in
its
narrow
sense
our
love
perhaps
had
been
less
intense
but
as
we
held
faithfulness
you
and
i
i
am
faithful
always
as
you
who
lie
asleep
for
ever
beneath
the
grass
while
the
days
and
nights
and
the
seasons
pass
pass
away
i
keep
your
memory
near
my
heart
my
brilliant
beautiful
guiding
star
till
long
live
over
i
too
depart
to
the
infinite
night
where
perhaps
you
are
oh
are
you
anywhere
loved
so
well
i
would
rather
know
you
alive
in
hell
than
think
your
beauty
is
nothing
now
with
its
deep
dark
eyes
and
tranquil
brow
where
the
hair
fell
softly
can
this
be
true
that
nothing
nowhere
exists
of
you
nothing
nowhere
oh
loved
so
well
i
have
forgotten
do
you
still
keep
thoughts
of
me
through
your
dreamless
sleep
oh
gone
from
me
lost
in
eternal
night
lost
star
of
light
risen
splendidly
set
so
soon
through
the
weariness
of
life
afternoon
i
dream
of
your
memory
yet
my
loved
and
lost
whom
i
could
not
save
my
youth
went
down
with
you
to
the
grave
though
other
planets
and
stars
may
rise
i
dream
of
your
soft
and
sorrowful
eyes
and
i
can
not
forget
song
of
faiz
ulla
just
at
the
time
when
jasmins
bloom
most
sweetly
in
the
summer
weather
lost
in
the
scented
jungle
gloom
one
sultry
night
we
spent
together
we
love
and
night
together
blent
a
trinity
of
tranced
content
yet
while
your
lips
were
wholly
mine
to
kiss
to
drink
from
to
caress
we
heard
some
faint
distress
harsh
drop
of
poison
in
sweet
wine
lessening
the
fulness
of
delight
some
quivering
note
of
human
pain
which
rose
and
fell
and
rose
again
in
plaintive
sobs
throughout
the
night
spoiling
the
perfumed
moonless
hours
we
spent
among
the
jasmin
flowers
story
of
lilavanti
they
lay
the
slender
body
down
with
all
its
wealth
of
wetted
hair
only
a
daughter
of
the
town
but
very
young
and
slight
and
fair
the
eyes
whose
light
one
can
not
see
are
sombre
doubtless
like
the
tresses
the
mouth
soft
curvings
seem
to
be
a
roseate
series
of
caresses
and
where
the
skin
has
all
but
dried
the
air
is
sultry
in
the
room
upon
her
breast
and
either
side
it
shows
a
soft
and
amber
bloom
by
women
here
who
knew
her
life
a
leper
husband
i
am
told
took
all
this
loveliness
to
wife
when
it
was
barely
ten
years
old
and
when
the
child
in
shocked
dismay
fled
from
the
hated
husband
care
he
caught
and
tied
her
so
they
say
down
to
his
bedside
by
her
hair
to
some
low
quarter
of
the
town
escaped
a
second
time
she
flew
her
beauty
brought
her
great
renown
and
many
lovers
here
she
knew
when
as
the
mystic
eastern
night
with
purple
shadow
filled
the
air
behind
her
window
framed
in
light
she
sat
with
jasmin
in
her
hair
at
last
she
loved
a
youth
who
chose
to
keep
this
wild
flower
for
his
own
he
in
his
garden
set
his
rose
where
it
might
bloom
for
him
alone
cholera
came
her
lover
died
want
drove
her
to
the
streets
again
and
women
found
her
there
who
tried
to
turn
her
beauty
into
gain
but
she
who
in
those
garden
ways
had
learnt
of
love
would
now
no
more
be
bartered
in
the
market
place
for
silver
as
in
days
before
that
former
life
she
strove
to
change
she
sold
the
silver
off
her
arms
while
all
the
world
grew
cold
and
strange
to
broken
health
and
fading
charms
till
finding
lovers
but
no
friend
nor
any
place
to
rest
or
hide
she
grew
despairing
at
the
end
slipped
softly
down
a
well
and
died
and
yet
how
short
when
all
is
said
this
little
life
of
love
and
tears
her
age
they
say
beside
her
bed
is
only
fifteen
years
the
garden
by
the
bridge
the
desert
sands
are
heated
parched
and
dreary
the
tigers
rend
alive
their
quivering
prey
in
the
near
jungle
here
the
kites
rise
weary
too
gorged
with
living
food
to
fly
away
all
night
the
hungry
jackals
howl
together
over
the
carrion
in
the
river
bed
or
seize
some
small
soft
thing
of
fur
or
feather
whose
dying
shrieks
on
the
night
air
are
shed
i
hear
from
yonder
temple
in
the
distance
whose
roof
with
obscene
carven
gods
is
piled
reiterated
with
a
sad
insistence
sobs
of
perhaps
some
immolated
child
strange
rites
here
where
the
archway
shade
is
deeper
are
consummated
in
the
river
bed
parias
steal
the
rotten
railway
sleeper
to
burn
the
bodies
of
their
cholera
dead
but
yet
their
lust
their
hunger
can
not
shame
them
goaded
by
fierce
desire
that
flays
and
stings
poor
beasts
and
poorer
men
nay
who
shall
blame
them
blame
the
inherent
cruelty
of
things
the
world
is
horrible
and
i
am
lonely
let
me
rest
here
where
yellow
roses
bloom
and
find
forgetfulness
remembering
only
your
face
beside
me
in
the
scented
gloom
nay
do
not
shrink
i
am
not
here
for
passion
i
crave
no
love
only
a
little
rest
although
i
would
my
face
lay
lover
fashion
against
the
tender
coolness
of
your
breast
i
am
so
weary
of
the
curse
of
living
the
endless
aimless
torture
tumult
fears
surely
if
life
were
any
god
free
giving
he
seeing
his
gift
long
since
went
blind
with
tears
seeing
us
our
fruitless
strife
our
futile
praying
our
luckless
present
and
our
bloodstained
past
poor
players
who
make
a
trick
or
two
in
playing
but
know
that
death
win
the
game
at
last
as
round
the
fowler
red
with
feathered
slaughter
the
little
joyous
lark
unconscious
sings
as
the
pink
lotus
floats
on
azure
water
innocent
of
the
mud
from
whence
it
springs
you
walk
through
life
unheeding
all
the
sorrow
the
fear
and
pain
set
close
around
your
way
meeting
with
hopeful
eyes
each
gay
living
with
joy
each
hour
of
glad
i
love
to
have
you
thus
nay
dear
lie
quiet
how
should
these
reverent
fingers
wrong
your
hair
so
calmly
careless
of
the
rush
and
riot
that
rages
round
is
seething
everywhere
you
do
not
understand
you
think
your
beauty
does
but
inflame
my
senses
to
desire
till
all
you
hold
as
loyalty
and
duty
is
shrunk
and
shrivelled
in
the
ardent
fire
you
wrong
me
wearied
out
with
thought
and
grieving
as
though
the
whole
world
sorrow
eat
my
heart
i
come
to
gaze
upon
your
face
believing
its
beauty
is
as
ointment
to
the
smart
lie
still
and
let
me
in
my
desolation
caress
the
soft
loose
hair
a
moment
span
since
loveliness
is
life
one
consolation
and
love
the
only
lethe
left
to
man
ah
give
me
here
beneath
the
trees
in
flower
beside
the
river
where
the
fireflies
pass
one
little
dusky
all
consoling
hour
lost
in
the
shadow
of
the
long
grown
grass
give
me
oh
you
whose
arms
are
soft
and
slender
whose
eyes
are
nothing
but
one
long
caress
against
your
heart
so
innocent
and
tender
a
little
love
and
some
forgetfulness
fate
knows
no
tears
just
as
the
dawn
of
love
was
breaking
across
the
weary
world
of
grey
just
as
my
life
once
more
was
waking
as
roses
waken
late
in
may
fate
blindly
cruel
and
stepped
in
and
carried
you
away
memories
have
i
none
in
keeping
of
times
i
held
you
near
my
heart
of
dreams
when
we
were
near
to
weeping
that
dawn
should
bid
us
rise
and
part
never
alas
i
saw
you
sleeping
with
soft
closed
eyes
and
lips
apart
breathing
my
name
still
through
your
ah
had
you
stayed
such
things
had
been
but
fate
unheeding
human
scheming
serenely
reckless
came
between
fate
with
her
cold
eyes
hard
and
gleaming
unseared
by
all
the
sorrow
seen
ah
i
never
told
you
i
did
not
show
in
speech
or
song
how
at
the
end
i
longed
to
fold
you
close
in
my
arms
so
fierce
and
strong
the
longing
grew
to
have
and
hold
you
you
and
you
only
all
life
long
they
who
know
nothing
call
me
fickle
keen
to
pursue
and
loth
to
keep
ah
could
they
see
these
tears
that
trickle
from
eyes
erstwhile
too
proud
to
weep
could
see
me
prone
beneath
the
sickle
while
pain
and
sorrow
stand
and
reap
unopened
scarce
yet
overblown
lie
the
hopes
that
round
me
grew
the
lights
are
low
and
more
than
lonely
this
life
i
lead
apart
from
you
come
back
come
back
i
want
you
only
and
you
who
loved
me
never
knew
you
loved
me
pleaded
for
compassion
on
all
the
pain
i
would
not
share
and
i
in
weary
halting
fashion
was
loth
to
listen
long
to
care
but
now
dear
god
i
faint
with
passion
for
your
far
eyes
and
distant
hair
yes
i
am
faint
with
love
and
broken
with
sleepless
nights
and
empty
days
i
want
your
soft
words
fiercely
spoken
your
tender
looks
and
wayward
ways
want
that
strange
smile
that
gave
me
token
of
many
things
that
no
man
says
cold
was
i
weary
slow
to
waken
till
startled
by
your
ardent
eyes
i
felt
the
soul
within
me
shaken
and
senses
rise
but
in
that
moment
you
were
taken
and
thus
we
lost
our
paradise
farewell
we
may
not
now
recover
that
golden
then
misspent
passed
by
we
shall
not
meet
as
loved
and
lover
here
or
hereafter
you
and
i
my
time
for
loving
you
is
over
love
has
no
future
but
to
die
and
thus
we
part
with
no
believing
in
any
chance
of
future
years
we
have
no
idle
no
hopes
and
fears
we
know
the
gods
grant
no
retrieving
a
wasted
chance
fate
knows
no
tears
verses

ulla
just
in
the
hush
before
dawn
a
little
wistful
wind
is
born
a
little
chilly
errant
breeze
that
thrills
the
grasses
stirs
the
trees
and
as
it
wanders
on
its
way
while
yet
the
night
is
cool
and
dark
the
first
carol
of
the
lark
its
plaintive
murmurs
seem
to
say
i
wait
the
sorrows
of
the
day
two
songs
by
sitara
of
kashmir
beloved
your
hair
was
golden
as
tender
tints
of
sunrise
as
corn
beside
the
river
in
softly
varying
hues
i
loved
you
for
your
slightness
your
melancholy
sweetness
your
changeful
eyes
that
promised
what
your
lips
would
still
refuse
you
came
to
me
and
loved
me
were
mine
upon
the
river
the
azure
water
saw
us
and
the
blue
transparent
sky
the
lotus
flowers
knew
it
our
happiness
together
while
life
was
only
river
only
love
and
you
and
i
love
wakened
on
the
river
to
sounds
of
running
water
with
silver
stars
for
witness
and
reflected
stars
for
light
awakened
to
existence
with
ripples
for
first
music
and
sunlight
on
the
river
for
earliest
sense
of
sight
love
grew
upon
the
river
among
the
scented
flowers
the
open
rosy
flowers
of
the
lotus
buds
in
bloom
love
brilliant
as
the
morning
more
fervent
than
the
and
tender
as
the
twilight
in
its
blue
transparent
gloom
love
died
upon
the
river
cold
snow
upon
the
mountains
the
lotus
leaves
turned
yellow
and
the
water
very
grey
our
kisses
faint
and
falter
the
clinging
hands
unfasten
the
golden
time
is
over
and
our
passion
dies
away
away
to
be
forgotten
a
ripple
on
the
river
that
flashes
in
the
sunset
that
flashed
and
died
away
second
song
the
girl
from
baltistan
throb
throb
throb
far
away
in
the
blue
transparent
night
on
the
outer
horizon
of
a
dreaming
consciousness
she
hears
the
sound
of
her
lover
nearing
boat
afar
afloat
on
the
river
loneliness
where
the
stars
are
the
only
light
hear
the
sound
of
the
straining
wood
like
a
broken
sob
of
a
heart
distress
loving
misunderstood
she
lies
with
her
loose
hair
spent
in
soft
disorder
on
a
silken
sheet
with
a
purple
woven
border
every
cell
of
her
brain
is
latent
fire
every
fibre
tense
with
restrained
desire
and
the
straining
oars
sound
clearer
clearer
the
boat
is
approaching
nearer
nearer
how
to
wait
through
the
moments
space
till
i
see
the
light
of
my
lover
face
throb
throb
throb
the
sound
dies
down
the
stream
till
it
only
clings
at
the
senses
edge
like
a
dream
doubtless
he
in
the
silence
lies
his
fair
face
turned
to
the
tender
skies
starlight
touching
his
sleeping
eyes
while
his
boat
caught
in
the
thickset
sedge
and
the
waters
round
it
gurgle
and
sob
or
floats
set
free
on
the
river
tide
oars
laid
aside
she
is
awake
and
knows
no
rest
passion
dies
and
is
dispossessed
of
his
brief
despotic
power
but
the
brain
once
kindled
would
still
be
afire
were
the
whole
world
pasture
to
its
desire
and
all
of
love
in
a
single
hour
a
single
wine
cup
filled
to
the
brim
given
to
slake
its
thirst
some
there
are
who
are
cursed
times
that
follow
fulfilled
desire
are
of
all
their
hours
the
worst
they
find
no
respite
and
reach
no
rest
though
passion
fail
and
desire
grow
dim
no
assuagement
comes
from
the
thing
possessed
for
possession
feeds
the
fire
oh
for
the
life
of
the
bright
hued
things
whose
marriage
and
death
are
one
a
floating
fusion
on
golden
wings
alit
with
passion
and
sun
but
we
who
a
thousand
times
as
the
spirit
or
senses
will
in
a
thousand
ways
in
a
thousand
climes
we
remain
unsatisfied
still
as
her
lover
left
her
alone
awake
she
lies
with
a
sleepless
brain
and
weary
eyes
she
turns
her
face
where
the
purple
silk
is
spread
still
sweet
with
delicate
perfume
his
presence
shed
her
arms
remembered
his
vanished
beauty
still
and
reminiscent
of
clustered
curls
her
fingers
thrill
while
the
wonderful
starlit
night
wears
slowly
on
till
the
light
of
another
day
serene
and
wan
pierces
the
eastern
skies
palm
trees
by
the
sea
love
let
me
thank
you
for
this
now
we
have
drifted
apart
wandered
away
from
the
sea
for
the
fresh
touch
of
your
kiss
for
the
young
warmth
of
your
heart
for
your
youth
given
to
me
thanks
for
the
curls
of
your
hair
softer
than
silk
to
the
hand
for
the
clear
gaze
of
your
eyes
for
yourself
delicate
fair
seen
as
you
lay
on
the
sand
under
the
violet
skies
thanks
for
the
words
that
you
said
secretly
tenderly
sweet
all
through
the
tropical
day
till
when
the
sunset
was
red
i
who
lay
still
at
your
feet
felt
my
life
ebbing
away
weary
and
worn
with
desire
only
yourself
could
console
love
let
me
thank
you
for
this
for
that
fierce
fervour
and
fire
burnt
through
my
lips
to
my
soul
from
the
white
heat
of
your
kiss
you
were
the
essence
of
spring
wayward
and
bright
as
a
flame
though
we
have
drifted
apart
still
how
the
syllables
sing
mixed
in
your
musical
name
deep
in
the
well
of
my
heart
once
in
the
lingering
light
thrown
from
the
west
on
the
sea
laid
you
your
garments
aside
slender
and
goldenly
bright
glimmered
your
beauty
set
free
bright
as
a
pearl
in
the
tide
once
ere
the
thrill
of
the
dawn
silvered
the
edge
of
the
sea
i
who
lay
watching
you
rest
pale
in
the
chill
of
the
morn
found
you
still
dreaming
of
me
stilled
by
love
fancies
possessed
fallen
on
sorrowful
days
love
let
me
thank
you
for
this
you
were
so
happy
with
me
wrapped
in
youth
roseate
haze
wanting
no
more
than
my
kiss
by
the
blue
edge
of
the
sea
ah
for
those
nights
on
the
sand
under
the
palms
by
the
sea
for
the
strange
dream
of
those
days
spent
in
the
passionate
land
for
your
youth
given
to
me
i
am
your
debtor
always
song
by
gulbaz
is
it
safe
to
lie
so
lonely
when
the
summer
twilight
closes
no
companion
maidens
only
you
asleep
among
the
roses
thirteen
fourteen
years
you
number
and
your
hair
is
soft
and
scented
perilous
is
such
a
slumber
in
the
twilight
all
untented
lonely
loveliness
means
danger
lying
in
your
nest
what
if
some
young
passing
stranger
broke
into
your
careless
rest
but
she
would
not
heed
the
warning
lay
alone
serene
and
slight
till
the
rosy
spears
of
morning
slew
the
darkness
of
the
night
young
love
walking
softly
found
her
in
the
scented
shady
closes
threw
his
ardent
arms
around
her
kissed
her
lips
beneath
the
roses
and
she
said
with
smiles
and
blushes
would
that
i
had
sooner
known
never
now
the
morning
thrushes
wake
and
find
me
all
alone
since
you
said
the
cover
sweet
protection
gave
but
slight
i
have
found
this
dear
young
lover
to
protect
me
through
the
night
kashmiri
song
pale
hands
i
love
beside
the
shalimar
where
are
you
now
who
lies
beneath
your
spell
whom
do
you
lead
on
rapture
roadway
far
before
you
agonise
them
in
farewell
oh
pale
dispensers
of
my
joys
and
pains
holding
the
doors
of
heaven
and
of
hell
how
the
hot
blood
rushed
wildly
through
the
veins
beneath
your
touch
until
you
waved
farewell
pale
hands
pink
tipped
like
lotus
buds
that
float
on
those
cool
waters
where
we
used
to
dwell
i
would
have
rather
felt
you
round
my
throat
crushing
out
life
than
waving
me
farewell
reverie
of
ormuz
the
persian
softly
the
feathery
fade
in
the
violet
distance
faintly
the
lingering
light
touches
the
edge
of
the
sea
sadly
the
music
of
waves
drifts
faint
as
an
anthem
insistence
heard
in
the
aisles
of
a
dream
over
the
sandhills
to
me
now
that
the
lights
are
reversed
and
the
singing
changed
into
sighing
now
that
the
wings
of
our
fierce
fugitive
passion
are
furled
take
i
unto
myself
all
alone
in
the
light
that
is
dying
much
of
the
sorrow
that
lies
hid
at
the
heart
of
the
world
sad
am
i
sad
for
your
loss
for
failing
the
charm
of
your
presence
even
the
sunshine
has
paled
leaving
the
zenith
less
blue
even
the
ocean
lessens
the
light
of
its
green
opalescence
since
to
my
sorrow
i
loved
loved
and
grew
weary
of
you
why
was
our
passion
so
fleeting
why
had
the
flush
of
your
beauty
only
so
slender
a
spell
only
so
futile
a
power
yet
even
thus
ever
is
life
save
when
long
custom
or
duty
moulds
into
sober
fruit
love
fragile
and
fugitive
flower
fain
would
my
soul
have
been
faithful
never
an
alien
pleasure
lured
me
away
from
the
light
lit
in
your
luminous
eyes
but
we
have
altered
the
world
as
pitiful
man
has
leisure
to
criticise
balance
take
counsel
assuredly
lies
all
through
the
centuries
man
has
gathered
his
flower
and
fenced
it
infinite
strife
to
attain
infinite
struggle
to
keep
holding
his
treasure
awhile
all
fate
and
all
forces
against
it
knowing
it
his
no
more
if
ever
his
vigilance
sleep
but
we
have
altered
the
world
as
pitiful
man
has
grown
stronger
so
that
the
things
we
love
are
as
easily
kept
as
won
therefore
the
ancient
fight
can
engage
and
detain
us
no
longer
and
all
too
swiftly
alas
passion
is
over
and
done
far
too
speedily
now
we
can
gather
the
coveted
treasure
enjoy
it
awhile
be
satiated
begin
to
tire
and
what
shall
be
done
henceforth
with
the
profitless
who
has
the
breath
to
kindle
the
ash
of
a
faded
fire
ah
if
it
only
had
lasted
after
my
ardent
endeavour
came
the
delirious
joy
flooding
my
life
like
a
sea
days
of
delight
that
are
burnt
on
the
brain
for
ever
and
ever
days
and
nights
when
you
loved
before
you
grew
weary
of
me
softly
the
sunset
decreases
dim
in
the
violet
distance
even
as
love
own
fervour
has
faded
away
from
me
leaving
the
weariness
the
monotonous
weight
of
existence
all
the
farewells
in
the
world
weep
in
the
sound
of
the
sea
sunstroke
oh
straight
white
road
that
runs
to
meet
across
green
fields
the
blue
green
sea
you
knew
the
little
weary
feet
of
my
child
bride
that
was
to
be
her
people
brought
her
from
the
shore
one
golden
day
in
sultry
june
and
i
stood
waiting
at
the
door
praying
my
eyes
might
see
her
soon
with
eager
arms
wide
open
thrown
now
never
to
be
satisfied
ere
i
could
make
my
love
my
own
she
closed
her
amber
eyes
and
died
alas
alas
they
took
no
heed
how
frail
she
was
my
little
one
but
brought
her
here
with
cruel
speed
beneath
the
fierce
relentless
sun
we
laid
her
on
the
marriage
bed
the
bridal
flowers
in
her
hand
a
maiden
from
the
ocean
led
only
alas
to
die
inland
i
walk
alone
the
air
is
sweet
the
white
road
wanders
to
the
sea
i
dream
of
those
two
little
feet
that
grew
so
tired
in
reaching
me
adoration
who
does
not
feel
desire
unending
to
solace
through
his
daily
strife
with
some
mysterious
mental
blending
the
hungry
loneliness
of
life
until
by
sudden
passion
shaken
as
terriers
shake
a
rat
at
play
he
finds
all
blindly
he
has
taken
the
old
hereditary
way
yet
in
the
moment
of
communion
the
very
heart
of
passion
fire
his
spirit
spurns
the
mortal
union
not
this
not
this
the
soul
desire
oh
you
by
whom
my
life
is
riven
and
reft
away
from
my
control
take
back
the
hours
of
passion
given
love
me
one
moment
from
your
soul
although
i
once
in
ardent
fashion
implored
you
long
to
give
me
this
in
hopes
to
stem
or
stifle
passion
your
hair
to
touch
your
lips
to
kiss
now
that
your
gracious
self
has
granted
the
loveliness
you
hold
as
naught
i
find
alas
not
that
i
wanted
possession
has
not
stifled
thought
desire
its
aim
has
only
shifted
built
hopes
upon
another
plan
and
i
in
love
for
you
have
drifted
beyond
all
passion
known
to
man
beyond
all
dreams
of
soft
caresses
the
solacing
of
any
kiss
beyond
the
fragrance
of
your
tresses
once
i
had
sold
my
soul
for
this
but
now
i
crave
no
mortal
union
thanks
for
that
sweetness
in
the
past
i
need
some
subtle
strange
communion
some
sense
that
join
at
last
long
past
the
pulse
and
pain
of
passion
long
left
the
limits
of
all
love
i
crave
some
nearer
fuller
fashion
some
unknown
way
beyond
above
some
infinitely
inner
fusion
as
wave
with
water
flame
with
fire
let
me
dream
once
the
dear
delusion
that
i
am
you
oh
heart
desire
your
kindness
lent
to
my
caresses
that
beauty
you
so
lightly
prize
the
midnight
of
your
sable
tresses
the
twilight
of
your
shadowed
eyes
ah
for
that
gift
all
thanks
are
given
yet
oh
adored
beyond
control
count
all
the
passionate
past
forgiven
and
love
me
once
once
from
your
soul
three
songs
of
the
tropic
day
redundant
charms
cool
twilight
soothes
away
the
sun
slips
down
behind
the
palms
and
leaves
the
landscape
grey
i
want
to
take
you
in
my
arms
and
kiss
your
lips
away
i
wake
with
sunshine
in
my
eyes
and
find
the
morning
blue
a
night
of
dreams
behind
me
lies
and
all
were
dreams
of
you
ah
how
i
wish
the
while
i
rise
that
what
i
dream
were
true
the
weary
day
laborious
pace
i
hasten
and
beguile
by
fancies
which
i
backwards
trace
to
things
i
loved
erstwhile
the
weary
sweetness
of
your
face
your
faint
illusive
smile
the
silken
softness
of
your
hair
where
faint
bronze
shadows
are
your
strangely
slight
and
youthful
air
no
passions
seem
to
mar
oh
why
since
fate
has
made
you
fair
must
fortune
keep
you
far
thus
spent
the
day
so
long
and
bright
less
hot
and
brilliant
seems
till
in
a
final
flare
of
light
the
sun
withdraws
his
beams
then
in
the
coolness
of
the
night
i
meet
you
in
my
dreams
second
song
how
much
i
loved
that
way
you
had
of
smiling
most
when
very
sad
a
smile
which
carried
tender
hints
of
delicate
tints
and
warbling
birds
of
sun
and
spring
and
yet
more
than
all
other
thing
of
weariness
beyond
all
words
none
other
ever
smiled
that
way
none
that
i
know
the
essence
of
all
gaiety
lay
of
all
mad
mirth
that
men
may
know
in
that
sad
smile
serene
and
slow
that
on
your
lips
was
wont
to
play
it
needed
many
delicate
lines
and
subtle
curves
and
roseate
tints
to
make
that
weary
radiant
smile
it
flickered
as
beneath
the
vines
the
sunshine
through
green
shadow
glints
on
the
pale
path
that
lies
below
flickered
and
flashed
and
died
away
but
the
strange
thoughts
it
woke
meanwhile
were
wont
to
stay
thoughts
of
strange
things
you
used
to
know
in
dim
dead
lives
lived
long
ago
some
madly
mirthful
merriment
whose
lingering
light
is
yet
unspent
some
unimaginable
woe
your
strange
sad
smile
forgets
these
not
though
you
yourself
long
since
forgot
third
song
written
during
fever
the
clouds
hang
very
low
they
take
the
to
their
breast
and
lay
their
arms
about
the
fields
the
wind
that
fans
me
lying
low
restless
with
great
desire
for
rest
no
cooling
touch
of
freshness
yields
i
sleepless
through
the
stifling
heat
watch
the
pale
lightning
constant
glow
between
the
wide
set
open
doors
i
lie
and
long
amidst
the
heat
the
fever
that
my
senses
know
for
that
cool
slenderness
of
yours
so
delicate
and
cool
you
are
a
roseleaf
that
has
lain
in
snow
a
snowflake
tinged
with
sunset
fire
you
do
not
know
so
young
you
are
how
fever
fans
the
senses
glow
to
uncontrollable
desire
and
fills
the
spaces
of
the
night
with
furious
and
frantic
thought
one
would
not
dare
to
think
by
day
ah
if
you
came
to
me
these
visions
would
be
turned
to
naught
these
hateful
dreams
be
held
at
bay
but
you
are
far
and
loneliness
my
only
lover
through
the
night
and
not
for
any
word
or
prayer
would
you
console
my
loneliness
or
lend
yourself
serene
and
slight
and
the
cool
clusters
of
your
hair
all
through
the
night
i
long
for
you
as
shipwrecked
men
in
tropics
yearn
for
the
fresh
flow
of
streams
and
springs
my
fevered
fancies
follow
you
as
dying
men
in
deserts
turn
their
thoughts
to
clear
and
chilly
things
such
dreams
are
mine
and
such
my
thirst
unceasing
and
unsatisfied
until
the
night
is
burnt
away
among
these
dreams
and
fevered
thirst
and
through
the
open
doorways
glide
the
white
feet
of
the
coming
day
the
regret
of
the
ranee
in
the
hall
of
peacocks
this
man
has
taken
my
husband
life
and
laid
my
brethren
low
no
sister
indeed
were
i
no
wife
to
pardon
and
let
him
go
yet
why
does
he
look
so
young
and
slim
as
he
weak
and
wounded
lies
how
hard
for
me
to
be
harsh
to
him
with
his
soft
appealing
eyes
his
hair
is
ruffled
upon
the
stone
and
the
slender
wrists
are
bound
so
young
and
yet
he
has
overthrown
his
scores
on
the
battle
ground
would
i
were
only
a
slave
to
whom
it
were
right
and
meet
to
wash
the
stains
of
the
war
away
the
dust
from
the
weary
feet
were
i
but
one
of
my
serving
girls
to
solace
his
pain
to
rest
shake
out
the
sand
from
the
soft
loose
curls
and
hold
him
against
my
breast
have
we
such
beauty
around
our
throne
such
lithe
and
delicate
strength
would
god
that
i
were
the
senseless
stone
to
support
his
slender
length
i
hate
those
wounds
that
trouble
my
sight
unknown
how
i
wish
you
lay
alone
in
my
silken
tent
while
i
charmed
the
pain
away
i
would
lay
you
down
on
the
royal
bed
i
would
bathe
your
wounds
with
wine
and
setting
your
feet
against
my
head
dream
you
were
lover
of
mine
my
crown
is
heavy
upon
my
hair
the
jewels
weigh
on
my
breast
all
i
would
leave
with
delight
to
share
your
pale
and
passionate
rest
but
hands
grow
restless
about
their
swords
lips
murmur
below
their
breath
the
queen
is
silent
too
long
my
lords
take
him
away
to
death
protest
by
alas
alas
this
wasted
night
with
all
its
air
its
thousand
stars
serenely
bright
i
lie
alone
and
long
for
you
long
for
your
hair
your
tranquil
eyes
of
twilight
hue
long
for
the
delicate
lips
their
sinuous
sweetness
laid
on
mine
here
where
the
slender
fountain
drips
here
where
the
yellow
roses
glow
pale
in
the
tender
silver
shine
the
stars
across
the
garden
throw
alas
alas
poor
passionate
youth
why
must
we
spend
these
lonely
nights
the
poets
hardly
speak
the
truth
despite
their
praiseful
litany
his
season
is
not
all
delights
nor
every
night
an
ecstasy
the
very
power
and
passion
that
make
make
his
days
one
golden
dream
how
he
must
suffer
for
their
sake
till
in
their
fierce
and
futile
rage
the
baffled
senses
almost
deem
they
might
be
happier
in
old
age
age
that
can
find
red
roses
sweet
and
yet
not
crave
a
mouth
hear
bulbuls
with
no
wish
that
feet
of
sweeter
singers
went
his
way
inhale
warm
breezes
from
the
south
yet
never
fed
his
fancy
stray
from
some
near
village
i
can
hear
the
cadenced
throbbing
of
a
drum
now
softly
distant
now
more
near
and
in
an
almost
human
fashion
it
plaintive
wistful
seems
to
come
laden
with
sighs
of
fitful
passion
to
mock
me
lying
here
alone
among
the
thousand
useless
flowers
upon
the
fountain
cold
stone
that
chills
me
as
i
lie
counting
the
slowly
passing
hours
by
the
white
spangles
in
the
sky
some
feast
the
celebrate
where
close
together
side
by
side
gay
in
their
gauze
and
tinsel
state
with
lips
serene
and
downcast
eyes
sit
the
young
bridegroom
and
his
bride
while
round
them
songs
and
laughter
rise
they
are
together
why
are
we
so
hopelessly
so
far
apart
oh
i
implore
you
come
to
me
come
to
me
solace
of
mine
eyes
come
consolation
of
my
heart
light
of
my
senses
what
replies
a
little
languid
mocking
breeze
that
rustles
through
the
jasmin
flowers
and
stirs
among
the
tamarind
trees
a
little
gurgle
of
the
spray
that
drips
unheard
though
silent
hours
then
breaks
in
sudden
bubbling
play
wind
have
you
never
loved
a
rose
and
water
seek
you
not
the
sea
why
therefore
mock
at
my
repose
is
it
my
fault
i
am
alone
beneath
the
feathery
tamarind
tree
whose
shadows
over
me
are
thrown
nay
i
am
mad
indeed
with
thirst
for
all
to
me
this
night
denied
and
drunk
with
longing
and
accurst
beyond
all
chance
of
sleep
or
rest
with
love
unslaked
unsatisfied
and
dreams
of
beauty
unpossessed
hating
the
hour
that
brings
you
not
mad
at
the
space
betwixt
us
twain
sad
for
my
empty
arms
so
hot
and
fevered
even
the
chilly
stone
can
scarcely
cool
their
burning
pain
and
oh
this
sense
of
being
alone
take
hence
o
night
your
wasted
hours
you
bring
me
not
my
life
delight
my
star
of
stars
my
flower
of
flowers
you
leave
me
loveless
and
forlorn
pass
on
most
false
and
futile
night
pass
on
and
perish
in
the
dawn
famine
song
death
and
famine
on
every
side
and
never
a
sign
of
rain
the
bones
of
those
who
have
starved
and
died
unburied
upon
the
plain
what
care
have
i
that
the
bones
bleach
white
they
may
be
mine
but
i
shall
sleep
in
your
arms
and
drink
your
lips
like
wine
cholera
riot
and
sudden
death
and
the
brave
red
blood
set
free
the
glazing
eye
and
the
failing
breath
but
what
are
these
things
to
me
your
breath
is
quick
and
your
eyes
are
bright
and
your
blood
is
red
like
wine
and
i
shall
sleep
in
your
arms
and
hold
your
lips
with
mine
i
hear
the
sound
of
a
thousand
tears
like
softly
pattering
rain
i
see
the
fever
folly
and
fears
fulfilling
man
tale
of
pain
but
for
the
moment
your
star
is
bright
i
revel
beneath
its
shine
for
i
shall
sleep
in
your
arms
and
feel
your
lips
on
mine
and
you
need
not
deem
me
over
cold
that
i
do
not
stop
to
think
for
all
the
pleasure
this
life
may
hold
is
on
the
precipice
brink
thought
could
but
lessen
my
soul
delight
and
she
may
not
pine
for
i
shall
lie
in
your
arms
and
close
your
lips
with
mine
i
trust
what
sorrow
the
fates
may
send
i
may
carry
quietly
through
and
pray
for
grace
when
i
reach
the
end
to
die
as
a
man
should
do
at
least
must
be
clear
and
bright
without
a
sorrowful
sign
because
i
sleep
in
your
arms
and
feel
your
lips
on
mine
so
on
i
work
in
the
blazing
sun
to
bury
what
dead
we
may
but
glad
oh
glad
when
the
day
is
done
and
the
night
falls
round
us
grey
would
those
we
covered
away
from
sight
had
a
rest
as
sweet
as
mine
for
i
shall
sleep
in
your
arms
and
drink
your
lips
like
wine
the
window
overlooking
the
harbour
sad
is
the
evening
all
the
level
sand
lies
left
and
lonely
while
the
restless
sea
tired
of
the
green
caresses
of
the
land
withdraws
into
its
own
infinity
but
still
more
sad
this
white
and
chilly
dawn
filling
the
vacant
spaces
of
the
sky
while
little
winds
blow
here
and
there
forlorn
and
all
the
stars
weary
of
shining
die
and
more
than
desolate
to
wake
to
rise
leaving
the
couch
where
softly
sleeping
still
what
through
the
past
night
made
my
heaven
lies
and
looking
out
across
the
window
sill
see
from
the
upper
window
vantage
ground
mankind
slip
into
harness
once
again
and
wearily
resume
his
daily
round
of
love
and
labour
toil
and
strife
and
pain
how
the
sad
thoughts
slip
back
across
the
night
the
whole
thing
seems
so
aimless
and
so
vain
what
use
the
raptures
passion
and
delight
burnt
out
as
though
they
could
not
wake
again
the
nerves
and
weary
brain
repeat
the
question
whither
all
these
passions
tend
this
curious
thirst
so
painful
and
so
sweet
so
fierce
so
very
to
what
end
even
if
seeking
for
ourselves
the
race
the
only
immortality
we
know
even
if
from
the
flower
of
our
embrace
some
spark
should
kindle
or
some
fruit
should
grow
what
were
the
use
the
gain
to
us
or
it
that
we
should
cause
another
you
or
me
another
life
from
our
light
passion
lit
to
suffer
like
ourselves
awhile
and
die
what
aim
what
end
indeed
our
being
runs
in
a
closed
circle
all
we
know
or
see
tends
to
assure
us
that
a
thousand
suns
teeming
perchance
with
life
have
ceased
to
be
ah
the
grey
dawn
seems
more
than
desolate
and
the
past
night
of
passion
worse
than
waste
love
but
a
useless
flower
that
soon
or
late
turns
to
a
fruit
with
bitter
aftertaste
youth
even
youth
seems
futile
and
forlorn
while
the
new
day
grows
slowly
white
above
pale
and
reproachful
comes
the
chilly
dawn
after
the
fervour
of
a
night
of
love
back
to
the
border
the
tremulous
morning
is
breaking
against
the
white
waste
of
the
sky
and
hundreds
of
birds
are
awaking
in
tamarisk
bushes
hard
by
i
waiting
alone
in
the
station
can
hear
in
the
distance
the
sound
of
that
iron
desolation
the
train
that
will
bear
me
from
you
will
carry
me
under
your
casement
you
feel
in
your
dreams
as
you
lie
the
quiver
from
gable
to
basement
the
rush
of
my
train
sweeping
by
and
i
shall
look
out
as
i
pass
it
your
dear
unforgettable
door
was
till
last
night
but
alas
it
will
never
be
mine
any
more
through
twilight
and
uncertain
where
frost
leaves
the
free
i
look
at
the
curtain
that
hid
so
much
pleasure
for
me
i
go
to
my
long
undone
duty
alone
in
the
chill
and
the
gloom
my
eyes
are
still
full
of
the
beauty
i
leave
in
your
room
lie
still
in
your
dreams
for
your
tresses
are
free
of
my
lingering
kiss
i
keep
you
awake
with
caresses
no
longer
be
happy
in
this
from
passion
you
told
me
you
hated
you
now
and
for
ever
set
free
i
pass
in
my
train
your
house
that
was
heaven
to
me
you
wo
find
a
trace
when
you
waken
of
me
or
my
love
of
the
past
rise
up
and
rejoice
i
have
taken
my
departure
at
last
my
fervent
and
useless
persistence
you
never
need
suffer
again
nor
even
perceive
in
the
distance
the
smoke
of
my
vanishing
train
reverie
alone
i
wait
till
her
twilight
gate
the
night
slips
quietly
through
with
shadow
and
gloom
and
purple
bloom
flung
over
the
zenith
blue
her
stars
that
tremble
would
fain
dissemble
light
over
lovers
thrown
her
hush
and
mystery
know
no
history
such
as
day
may
own
day
has
record
of
pleasure
and
pain
but
things
that
are
done
by
night
remain
for
ever
and
ever
unknown
for
a
thousand
years
a
thousand
skies
night
has
brought
men
love
therefore
the
old
old
longings
rise
as
the
light
grows
dim
above
therefore
now
that
the
shadows
close
and
the
mists
weird
and
white
while
time
is
scented
with
musk
and
rose
magic
with
silver
light
i
long
for
love
will
you
grant
me
some
day
is
over
at
last
come
as
lovers
have
always
come
through
the
evenings
of
the
past
swiftly
as
lovers
have
always
come
softly
as
lovers
have
always
come
through
the
past
sea
song
against
the
planks
of
the
cabin
side
so
slight
a
thing
between
them
and
me
the
great
waves
thundered
and
throbbed
and
sighed
the
great
green
waves
of
the
indian
sea
your
face
was
white
as
the
foam
is
white
your
hair
was
curled
as
the
waves
are
curled
i
would
we
had
steamed
and
reached
that
night
the
sea
last
edge
the
end
of
the
world
the
wind
blew
in
through
the
open
port
so
freshly
joyous
and
salt
and
free
your
hair
it
lifted
your
lips
it
sought
and
then
swept
back
to
the
open
sea
the
engines
throbbed
with
their
constant
beat
your
heart
was
nearer
and
all
i
heard
your
lips
were
salt
but
i
found
them
sweet
while
acquiescent
you
spoke
no
word
so
straight
you
lay
in
your
narrow
berth
rocked
by
the
waves
and
you
seemed
to
be
essence
of
all
that
is
sweet
on
earth
of
all
that
is
sad
and
strange
at
sea
and
you
were
white
as
the
foam
is
white
your
hair
was
curled
as
the
waves
are
curled
ah
had
we
but
sailed
and
reached
that
night
the
sea
last
edge
the
end
of
the
world
to
the
hills
is
eight
miles
out
and
eight
miles
in
just
at
the
break
of
morn
is
ice
without
and
flame
within
to
gain
a
kiss
at
dawn
far
where
the
lilac
hills
arise
soft
from
the
misty
plain
a
lone
enchanted
hollow
lies
where
i
at
last
drew
rein
midwinter
grips
this
lonely
land
this
stony
treeless
waste
where
east
due
east
across
the
sand
we
fly
in
fevered
haste
pull
up
the
east
will
soon
be
red
the
wild
duck
westward
fly
and
make
above
my
anxious
head
triangles
in
the
sky
like
wind
we
go
we
both
are
still
so
young
all
thanks
to
fate
it
cuts
like
knives
this
air
so
chill
dear
god
if
i
am
late
behind
us
wrapped
in
mist
and
sleep
the
ruined
city
lies
although
we
race
we
seem
to
creep
while
lighter
grow
the
skies
eight
miles
out
only
eight
miles
in
good
going
all
the
way
but
more
and
more
the
clouds
begin
to
redden
into
day
and
every
peak
grows
pink
an
iridescent
gem
my
heart
beats
quick
with
joy
to
think
how
i
am
nearing
them
as
mile
on
mile
behind
us
falls
till
oh
delight
i
see
my
heart
desire
who
softly
calls
across
the
gloom
to
me
the
utter
joy
of
that
first
love
no
later
love
has
given
when
while
the
skies
grew
light
above
we
entered
into
heaven
till
i
wake
when
i
am
dying
lean
over
me
tenderly
softly
stoop
as
the
yellow
roses
droop
in
the
wind
from
the
south
so
i
may
when
i
wake
if
there
be
an
awakening
keep
what
lulled
me
to
sleep
the
touch
of
your
lips
on
my
mouth
his
rubies
told
by
valgovind
along
the
hot
and
endless
road
calm
and
erect
with
haggard
eyes
the
prisoner
bore
his
fetters
load
beneath
the
scorching
azure
skies
serene
and
tall
with
brows
unbent
without
a
hope
without
a
friend
he
under
escort
onward
went
with
death
to
meet
him
at
the
end
the
poppy
fields
were
pink
and
gay
on
either
side
and
in
the
heat
their
drowsy
scent
exhaled
all
day
a
fragrance
almost
sweet
and
when
the
cool
of
evening
fell
and
tender
colours
touched
the
sky
he
still
felt
youth
within
him
dwell
and
half
forgot
he
had
to
die
sometimes
at
night
the
lit
and
casting
fitful
light
around
his
guard
would
let
him
sit
and
talk
awhile
with
them
unbound
thus
they
the
night
before
the
last
were
resting
when
a
group
of
girls
across
the
small
encampment
passed
with
laughing
lips
and
scented
curls
then
in
the
prisoner
weary
eyes
a
sudden
light
lit
up
once
more
the
women
saw
him
with
surprise
and
pity
for
the
chains
he
bore
for
little
women
reck
of
crime
if
young
and
fair
the
criminal
be
here
in
this
tropic
amorous
clime
where
love
is
still
untamed
and
free
and
one
there
was
she
walked
less
fast
behind
the
rest
perhaps
beguiled
by
his
lithe
form
who
as
she
passed
waited
a
little
while
and
smiled
the
guard
in
kindly
eastern
fashion
smiled
to
themselves
and
let
her
stay
so
tolerant
of
human
passion
to
love
he
has
but
one
more
day
yet
when
the
soft
and
scented
gloom
scarce
lighted
by
the
dying
fire
his
arms
caressed
her
youth
and
bloom
with
him
it
was
not
all
desire
for
me
he
whispered
as
he
lay
but
little
life
remains
to
live
one
thing
i
crave
to
take
away
you
have
the
gift
but
will
you
give
if
i
could
know
some
child
of
mine
would
live
his
life
and
see
the
sun
across
these
fields
of
poppies
shine
what
should
i
care
that
mine
is
done
to
die
would
not
be
dying
quite
leaving
a
little
life
behind
you
were
you
kind
to
me
could
grant
me
this
but
are
you
kind
see
i
have
something
here
for
you
for
you
and
it
if
it
there
be
soft
in
the
gloom
her
glances
grew
with
gentle
tears
he
could
not
see
he
took
the
chain
from
off
his
neck
hid
in
the
silver
chain
there
lay
three
rubies
without
flaw
or
fleck
she
answered
softly
i
will
stay
he
drew
her
close
the
moonless
skies
shed
little
light
the
fire
was
dead
soft
pity
filled
her
youthful
eyes
and
many
tender
things
she
said
throughout
the
hot
and
silent
night
all
that
he
asked
of
her
she
gave
and
left
alone
ere
morning
light
he
went
serenely
to
the
grave
happy
for
even
when
the
rope
confined
his
neck
his
thoughts
were
free
and
centered
round
his
secret
hope
the
little
life
that
was
to
be
when
poppies
bloomed
again
she
bore
his
child
who
gaily
laughed
and
crowed
while
round
his
tiny
neck
he
wore
the
rubies
given
on
the
road
for
his
small
sake
she
wished
to
wait
but
vainly
to
forget
she
tried
and
grieving
for
the
prisoner
fate
she
broke
her
gentle
heart
and
died
song
of
taj
mahomed
dear
is
my
inlaid
sword
across
the
border
it
brought
me
much
reward
dear
is
my
mistress
the
jewelled
treasure
of
an
amorous
hour
dear
beyond
measure
are
my
dreams
and
fancies
these
i
adore
for
these
i
live
and
labour
holding
them
more
than
sword
or
jewelled
mistress
for
this
indeed
may
rust
and
that
prove
faithless
but
till
my
limbs
are
dust
i
have
my
fancies

the
daylight
is
dying
the

flying

burn
in

the
sun
throws
a
late
lingering
roseate
kiss
to
the
landscape
to
bid
it
the
time
of
our
trysting

glamour

much
is
forgiven
to

who
have

the
rapture

that

call
mad

shame
of
that
delicate
vice
that
is
hardly
vice
so
reticent
rare
ethereal
as
the
scent
of
buds
and
spice
in
this
eastern
air
on
shores
i
colour
the
cowrie
shell
with
its
edges
curled
and
deep
in
datura
poison
buds
i
dwell
in
a
perfumed
world
my
lilac
tinges
the
edge
of
the
evening
sky
where
the

clings
my
purple
lends
an
imperial
majesty
to
the
robes
of

am
i
and
for
me
ever
men
curse
and
pray
selling
their
souls
and
each
other
by
night
and
day
a
sordid
colour
and
yet
i
make
some
things
fair
dying
sunsets
fields
of
corn
and
a
maiden
hair
thus
they
discoursed
in
the
daytime
violet
yellow
and
blue
emerald
scarlet
and
the
pink
and
perfect
hue
thus
they
spoke
in
the
sunshine
when
their
beauty
was
manifest
till
the
night
came
and
the
silence
and
gave
them
an
equal
rest
lalila
to
the
ferengi
lover
why
above
others
was
i
so
blessed
and
honoured
to
be
chosen
one
to
hold
you
sleeping
against
my
breast
as
now
i
may
hold
your
only
son
twelve
months
ago
that
wonderful
night
you
gave
your
life
to
me
in
a
kiss
have
i
done
well
for
that
past
delight
in
return
to
have
given
you
this
look
down
at
his
face
your
face
beloved
his
eyes
are
azure
as
yours
are
blue
in
every
line
of
his
form
is
proved
how
well
i
loved
you
and
only
you
i
felt
the
secret
hope
at
my
heart
turned
suddenly
to
the
living
joy
and
knew
that
your
life
and
mine
had
part
as
golden
grains
in
a
brass
alloy
and
learning
thus
that
your
child
was
mine
thrilled
by
the
sense
of
its
stirring
life
i
held
myself
as
a
sacred
shrine
afar
from
pleasure
and
pain
and
strife
that
all
unworthy
i
might
not
be
of
that
you
had
deigned
to
cause
to
dwell
hidden
away
in
the
heart
of
me
as
white
pearls
hide
in
a
dusky
shell
do
you
remember
when
first
you
laid
your
lips
on
mine
that
enchanted
night
my
eyes
were
timid
my
lips
afraid
you
seemed
so
slender
and
strangely
white
i
always
tremble
the
moments
flew
swiftly
to
dawn
that
took
you
away
but
this
is
a
small
and
lovely
you
content
to
rest
in
my
arms
all
day
oh
since
you
have
sought
me
lord
for
this
and
given
your
only
child
to
me
my
life
devoted
to
yours
and
his
whilst
i
am
living
will
always
be
and
after
death
through
the
long
to
be
which
i
think
must
surely
keep
love
laws
i
should
you
chance
to
have
need
of
me
am
ever
and
always
only
yours
on
the
city
wall
upon
the
city
ramparts
lit
up
by
sunset
gleam
the
blue
eyes
that
conquer
meet
the
darker
eyes
that
dream
the
dark
eyes
so
eastern
and
the
blue
eyes
from
the
west
the
last
alight
with
action
the
first
so
full
of
rest
brown
that
seem
to
hold
the
past
its
magic
mystery
blue
that
catch
the
early
light
of
ages
yet
to
be
meet
and
fall
and
meet
again
then
linger
look
and
smile
time
and
distance
all
forgotten
for
a
little
while
happy
on
the
city
wall
in
the
warm
spring
weather
all
the
force
of
nature
laws
drawing
them
together
east
and
west
so
gaily
blending
for
a
little
space
all
the
sunshine
seems
to
centre
round
th
enchanted
place
one
rides
down
the
dusty
road
one
watches
from
the
wall
azure
eyes
would
fain
return
and
amber
eyes
recall
would
fain
be
on
the
ramparts
and
resting
heart
to
heart
but
time
o
love
is
overpast
east
and
west
must
part
blue
eyes
so
clear
and
brilliant
brown
eyes
so
dark
and
deep
those
are
dim
and
ride
away
these
cry
themselves
to
sleep
oh
since
love
is
all
so
short
the
sob
so
near
the
smile
eyes
that
always
conquer
us
is
it
worth
your
while
love
lightly
there
were
roses
in
the
hedges
and
sunshine
in
the
sky
red
lilies
in
the
sedges
where
the
water
rippled
by
a
thousand
bulbuls
singing
oh
how
jubilant
they
were
and
a
thousand
flowers
flinging
their
sweetness
on
the
air
but
you
who
sat
beside
me
had
a
shadow
in
your
eyes
their
sadness
seemed
to
chide
me
when
i
gave
you
scant
replies
you
asked
did
i
remember
and
when
had
i
ceased
to
care
in
vain
you
fanned
the
ember
for
the
love
flame
was
not
there
and
so
since
you
are
tired
of
me
you
ask
me
to
forget
what
is
the
use
of
caring
now
that
you
no
longer
care
when
love
is
dead
his
memory
can
only
bring
regret
but
how
can
i
forget
you
with
the
flowers
in
your
hair
what
use
the
scented
roses
or
the
azure
of
the
sky
they
are
sweet
when
love
reposes
but
then
he
had
to
die
what
could
i
do
in
leaving
you
but
ask
you
to
forget
i
suffered
too
in
grieving
you
i
all
but
loved
you
yet
but
half
love
is
a
treason
that
no
lover
can
forgive
i
had
loved
you
for
a
season
i
had
no
more
to
give
you
saw
my
passion
faltered
for
i
could
but
let
you
see
and
it
was
not
i
that
altered
but
fate
that
altered
me
and
so
since
i
am
tired
of
love
i
ask
you
to
forget
what
is
the
use
you
caring
now
that
i
no
longer
care
when
love
is
dead
his
memory
can
only
bring
regret
forget
me
oh
forget
me
and
my
hair
no
rival
like
the
past
as
those
who
eat
a
luscious
fruit
sunbaked
full
of
sweet
juice
with
zest
until
they
find
it
finished
and
their
appetite
unslaked
and
so
return
and
eat
the
rind
we
who
in
youth
set
white
and
careless
teeth
in
the
ripe
fruits
of
pleasure
while
they
last
later
creep
back
to
gnaw
the
sheath
and
find
there
is
no
rival
like
the
past
verse
by
taj
mahomed
when
first
i
loved
i
gave
my
very
soul
utterly
unreserved
to
love
control
but
love
deceived
me
wrenched
my
youth
away
and
made
the
gold
of
life
for
ever
grey
long
i
lived
lonely
yet
i
tried
in
vain
with
any
other
joy
to
stifle
pain
there
no
other
joy
i
learned
to
know
and
so
returned
to
love
as
long
ago
yet
i
this
little
while
ere
i
go
hence
love
very
lightly
now
in
lines
by
taj
mahomed
this
passion
is
but
an
ember
of
a
sun
of
a
fire
long
set
i
could
not
live
and
remember
and
so
i
love
and
forget
you
say
and
the
tone
is
fretful
that
my
mourning
days
were
few
you
call
me
over
forgetful
my
god
if
you
only
knew
there
is
no
breeze
to
cool
the
heat
of
love
the
listless
catch
the
breeze
above
the
huts
that
edge
the
salt
lagoon
there
is
no
breeze
to
cool
the
heat
of
love
no
wind
from
land
or
sea
at
night
or
noon
perfumed
and
robed
i
wait
my
lord
for
you
and
my
heart
waits
alert
with
strained
delight
my
flowers
are
loath
to
close
as
though
they
knew
that
you
will
come
to
me
before
the
night
in
the
verandah
all
the
lights
are
lit
and
softly
veiled
in
rose
to
please
your
eyes
between
the
pillars
flying
foxes
flit
their
wings
transparent
on
the
lilac
skies
come
soon
my
lord
come
soon
i
almost
fear
my
heart
may
fail
me
in
this
keen
suspense
break
with
delight
at
last
to
know
you
near
pleasure
is
one
with
pain
if
too
intense
i
envy
these
the
steps
that
you
will
tread
the
jasmin
that
will
touch
you
by
its
leaves
when
in
your
slender
height
you
stoop
your
head
at
the
low
door
beneath
the
eaves
for
though
you
utterly
belong
to
me
and
love
has
done
his
utmost
us
twain
your
slightest
careless
touch
yet
seems
to
be
that
keen
delight
so
much
akin
to
pain
the
night
breeze
blows
across
the
still
lagoon
and
stirs
the
till
they
wave
above
our
huts
oh
come
my
lord
come
soon
there
is
no
breeze
to
cool
the
heat
of
love
every
time
you
give
yourself
to
me
the
gift
seems
greater
and
yourself
more
fair
this
hut
has
come
to
be
a
temple
since
my
lord
you
visit
there
and
as
the
water
gurgling
softly
goes
among
the
piles
beneath
the
slender
floor
i
hear
it
murmur
as
it
seaward
flows
of
the
great
wonder
seen
upon
the
shore
the
miracle
that
you
should
come
to
me
whom
the
whole
world
seeing
can
but
desire
it
is
as
though
some
white
star
stooped
to
be
the
messmate
of
our
little
cooking
fire
leaving
the
glory
of
his
purple
skies
and
the
white
friendship
of
the
crescent
moon
and
yet
i
look
into
your
brilliant
eyes
and
find
content
oh
come
my
lord
come
soon
perfumed
and
robed
i
wait
for
you
i
wait
the
flowers
that
please
you
wreathed
about
my
hair
and
this
poor
face
set
forth
in
jewelled
state
so
more
than
proud
since
you
have
found
it
fair
my
lute
is
ready
and
the
fragrant
drink
your
lips
may
honour
how
it
will
rejoice
losing
its
life
in
yours
the
lute
i
think
but
wastes
the
time
when
i
might
hear
your
voice
but
you
desired
it
therefore
i
obey
your
slightest
as
your
utmost
wish
or
will
whether
it
please
you
to
caress
or
slay
it
would
please
me
to
give
obedience
still
i
would
delight
to
die
beneath
your
kiss
i
envy
that
young
maiden
who
was
slain
so
her
warm
blood
flowing
beneath
the
kiss
might
ease
the
wounded
sultan
of
his
pain
if
she
loved
him
as
i
love
you
my
lord
there
is
no
pleasure
on
the
earth
so
sweet
as
is
the
pain
endured
for
one
adored
if
i
lay
crushed
beneath
your
slender
feet
i
should
be
happy
ah
come
soon
come
soon
see
how
the
stars
grow
large
and
white
above
the
land
breeze
blows
across
the
salt
lagoon
there
is
no
breeze
to
cool
the
heat
of
love
malay
song
the
stars
await
serene
and
white
the
unarisen
moon
oh
come
and
stay
with
me
beside
the
salt
lagoon
my
hut
is
small
but
as
you
lie
you
see
the
lighted
shore
and
hear
the
rippling
water
sigh
beneath
the
floor
no
gift
have
i
of
jewels
or
flowers
my
room
is
poor
and
bare
but
all
the
silver
sea
is
ours
and
all
the
scented
air
blown
from
the
mainland
where
there
grows
th
intriguer
of
the
night
the
flower
that
you
have
named
tube
rose
sweet
scented
slim
and
white
the
flower
that
when
the
air
is
still
and
no
land
breezes
blow
from
its
pale
petals
can
distil
a
phosphorescent
glow
i
see
your
ship
at
anchor
ride
her
captive
lightning
shine
before
she
takes
tide
let
this
one
night
be
mine
though
in
the
language
of
your
land
my
words
are
poor
and
few
oh
read
my
eyes
and
understand
i
give
my
youth
to
you
the
temple
dancing
girl
you
will
be
mine
those
lightly
dancing
feet
falling
as
softly
on
the
careless
street
as
the
petals
of
a
flower
will
bring
you
here
at
the
appointed
hour
and
all
the
temple
little
links
and
laws
will
not
for
long
protect
your
loveliness
i
have
a
stronger
force
to
aid
my
cause
nature
great
law
to
love
and
to
possess
throughout
those
sleepless
watches
when
i
lay
wakeful
desiring
what
i
might
not
see
i
knew
it
helped
those
hours
from
dusk
to
day
in
this
one
thing
fate
would
be
kind
to
me
you
will
consent
through
all
my
veins
like
wine
this
prescience
flows
your
lips
meet
mine
above
your
clear
soft
eyes
look
upward
into
mine
dim
in
a
silent
ecstasy
of
love
the
clustered
softness
of
your
waving
hair
that
curious
paleness
which
enchants
me
so
and
all
your
delicate
strength
and
youthful
air
destiny
will
compel
you
to
bestow
refuse
withdraw
and
hesitate
awhile
your
young
reluctance
does
but
fan
the
flame
my
partner
love
waits
with
a
tender
smile
who
play
against
him
play
a
losing
game
i
strong
in
nothing
else
have
strength
in
this
the
subtlest
most
resistless
force
we
know
is
aiding
me
and
you
must
stoop
and
kiss
the
genius
of
the
race
will
have
it
so
yet
make
it
not
too
long
nor
too
intense
my
thirst
lest
i
should
break
beneath
the
strain
and
the
worn
nerves
and
sense
enjoy
not
what
they
spent
themselves
to
gain
lest
in
the
hour
when
you
consent
to
share
that
human
passion
beauty
makes
divine
i
over
worn
should
find
you
over
fair
lest
i
should
die
before
i
make
you
mine
you
will
consent
those
slim
reluctant
feet
falling
as
lightly
on
the
careless
street
as
the
white
petals
of
a
flower
will
bring
you
here
at
the
appointed
hour
farewell
to
burmah
on
the
wooden
deck
of
the
wooden
junk
silent
alone
we
lie
with
silver
foam
about
the
bow
and
a
silver
moon
in
the
sky
a
glimmer
of
dimmer
silver
here
from
the
anklets
round
your
feet
our
lips
may
close
on
each
other
lips
but
never
our
souls
may
meet
for
though
in
my
arms
you
lie
at
rest
your
name
i
have
never
heard
to
carry
a
thought
between
us
two
we
have
not
a
single
word
and
yet
what
matter
we
do
not
speak
when
the
ardent
eyes
have
spoken
the
way
of
love
is
a
sweeter
way
when
the
silence
is
unbroken
as
a
wayward
fancy
tired
at
times
of
the
cultured
damask
rose
drifts
away
to
the
tangled
copse
where
the
wild
anemone
grows
so
the
ordered
and
licit
love
ashore
is
hardly
fresh
and
free
as
this
light
love
in
the
open
wind
and
salt
of
the
outer
sea
so
sweet
you
are
with
your
tinted
cheeks
and
your
small
caressive
hands
what
if
i
carried
you
home
with
me
where
our
golden
temple
stands
yet
this
were
folly
indeed
to
bind
in
fetters
of
permanence
a
passing
dream
whose
enchantment
charms
because
of
its
trancience
life
is
ever
a
slave
to
time
we
have
but
an
hour
to
rest
her
steam
is
up
and
her
lighters
leave
the
vessel
that
takes
me
west
and
never
again
we
two
shall
meet
as
we
chance
to
meet
on
the
junk
whose
painted
eyes
gaze
forth
in
desolate
want
of
sight
and
what
is
love
at
its
best
but
this
conceived
by
a
passing
glance
nursed
and
reared
in
a
transient
mood
on
a
drifting
sea
of
chance
for
rudderless
craft
are
all
our
loves
among
the
rocks
and
the
shoals
well
we
may
know
one
another
speech
but
never
each
other
souls
give
here
your
lips
and
kiss
me
again
we
have
but
a
moment
more
before
we
set
the
sail
to
the
mast
before
we
loosen
the
oar
to
you
and
my
thanks
to
you
for
the
rest
you
let
me
share
while
this
night
drifted
away
to
the
past
to
join
the
nights
that
were
starlight
o
beautiful
stars
when
you
see
me
go
hither
and
thither
in
search
of
love
do
you
think
me
faithless
who
gleam
and
glow
serene
and
fixed
in
the
blue
above
o
stars
so
golden
it
is
not
so
but
there
is
a
garden
i
dare
not
see
there
is
a
place
where
i
fear
to
go
since
the
charm
and
glory
of
life
to
me
the
brown
earth
covered
there
long
ago
o
stars
you
saw
it
you
know
you
know
hither
and
thither
i
wandering
go
with
aimless
haste
and
wearying
fret
in
a
search
for
pleasure
and
love
not
so
seeking
desperately
to
forget
you
see
so
many
o
stars
you
know
sampan
song
a
little
breeze
blew
over
the
sea
and
it
came
from
far
away
across
the
fields
of
millet
and
rice
all
warm
with
sunshine
and
sweet
with
spice
it
lifted
his
curls
and
kissed
him
thrice
as
upon
the
deck
he
lay
it
said
oh
idle
upon
the
sea
awake
and
with
sleep
have
done
haul
up
the
widest
sail
of
the
prow
and
come
with
me
to
the
rice
fields
now
she
longs
oh
how
can
i
tell
you
how
to
show
you
your
son
song
of
the
devoted
slave
there
is
one
god
mahomed
his
prophet
had
i
his
power
i
would
take
the
topmost
peaks
of
the
himalayas
and
would
range
them
around
your
dwelling
during
the
heats
of
summer
to
cool
the
airs
that
fan
your
serene
and
delicate
presence
had
i
the
power
your
courtyard
should
ever
be
filled
with
the
fleetest
of
camels
laden
with
inlaid
armour
jewels
and
trappings
for
horses
ripe
dates
from
egypt
and
spices
and
musk
from
arabia
and
the
sacred
waters
of
well
transported
thither
should
bubble
and
flow
in
your
chamber
to
bathe
the
delicate
slender
and
wayworn
feet
of
my
lord
returning
from
travel
had
i
the
power
fine
woven
silk
from
the
further
east
should
conceal
your
beauty
clinging
around
you
in
amorous
folds
caressive
silken
beautiful
persian
boys
should
kneeling
serve
you
and
the
floor
beneath
your
sandalled
feet
should
be
smooth
and
golden
had
i
the
power
and
if
ever
your
clear
and
stately
thoughts
should
turn
to
women
kings
daughters
maidens
should
be
appointed
to
your
caresses
that
the
youth
and
the
strength
of
my
lord
might
never
be
wasted
in
light
or
sterile
love
but
enrich
the
world
with
his
children
had
i
the
power
whilst
i
should
sit
in
the
outer
court
of
the
water
palace
to
await
the
time
when
you
went
forth
for
pleasure
or
warfare
descending
the
stairs
rose
crowned
or
armed
and
arrayed
in
purple
to
mark
the
place
where
your
steps
have
fallen
and
kiss
the
footprints
had
i
the
power
the
singer
the
singer
only
sang
the
joy
of
life
for
all
too
well
alas
the
singer
knew
how
hard
the
daily
toil
how
keen
the
strife
how
salt
the
falling
tear
the
joys
how
few
he
who
thinks
hard
soon
finds
it
hard
to
live
learning
the
secret
bitterness
of
things
so
leaving
thought
the
singer
strove
to
give
a
level
lightness
to
his
lyric
strings
he
only
sang
of
love
its
joy
and
pain
but
each
man
in
his
early
season
loves
each
finds
the
old
lost
paradise
again
unfolding
leaves
and
roses
nesting
doves
and
though
that
sunlit
time
flies
all
too
fleetly
delightful
days
that
dance
away
too
soon
its
early
morning
freshness
lingers
sweetly
throughout
life
grey
and
tedious
afternoon
and
he
whose
dreams
enshrine
her
tender
eyes
and
she
whose
senses
wait
his
waking
hand
impatient
youth
that
tired
but
sleepless
lies
will
read
perhaps
and
reading
understand
oh
roseate
lips
he
would
have
loved
to
kiss
oh
eager
lovers
that
he
never
knew
what
should
you
know
of
him
or
words
of
his
but
all
the
songs
he
sang
were
sung
for
you
malaria
he
lurks
among
the
reeds
beside
the
marsh
red
oleanders
twisted
in
his
hair
his
eyes
are
haggard
and
his
lips
are
harsh
upon
his
breast
the
bones
show
gaunt
and
bare
the
green
and
stagnant
waters
lick
his
feet
and
from
their
filmy
iridescent
scum
clouds
of
mosquitoes
gauzy
in
the
heat
rise
with
his
gifts
death
and
delirium
his
messengers
they
bear
the
deadly
taint
on
spangled
wings
aloft
and
far
away
making
thin
music
strident
and
yet
faint
from
golden
eve
to
silver
break
of
day
the
baffled
sleeper
hears
th
incessant
whine
through
his
tormented
dreams
and
finds
no
rest
the
thirsty
insects
use
his
blood
for
wine
probe
his
blue
veins
and
pasture
on
his
breast
while
far
away
he
in
the
marshes
lies
staining
the
stagnant
water
with
his
breath
an
endless
hunger
burning
in
his
eyes
a
famine
unassuaged
whose
food
is
death
he
hides
among
the
ghostly
mists
that
float
over
the
water
weird
and
white
and
chill
and
peasants
passing
in
their
laden
boat
shiver
and
feel
a
sense
of
coming
a
thousand
burn
and
die
he
takes
no
heed
their
bones
unburied
strewn
upon
the
plain
only
increase
the
frenzy
of
his
greed
to
add
more
victims
to
th
already
slain
he
loves
the
haggard
frame
the
shattered
mind
gloats
with
delight
upon
the
glazing
eye
yet
in
one
thing
his
cruelty
is
kind
he
sends
them
lovely
dreams
before
they
die
dreams
that
bestow
on
them
their
heart
desire
visions
that
find
them
mad
and
leave
them
blest
to
sink
forgetful
of
the
fever
fire
softly
as
in
a
lover
arms
to
rest
fancy
far
in
the
further
east
the
skilful
craftsman
fashioned
this
fancy
for
the
west
delight
this
rose
and
azure
dragon
crouching
softly
upon
the
satin
skin
and
white
and
you
lay
silent
while
his
slender
needles
pricked
the
intricate
pattern
on
your
arm
combining
deftly
cruelty
and
beauty
that
subtle
union
whose
child
is
charm
charm
irresistible
the
lovely
something
we
follow
in
our
dreams
but
may
not
reach
the
unattainable
divine
enchantment
hinted
in
music
never
heard
in
speech
this
from
the
blue
design
exhales
towards
me
as
incense
rises
from
the
homes
of
prayer
while
the
unfettered
eyes
allured
and
rested
urge
the
forbidden
lips
to
stoop
and
share
share
in
the
sweetness
of
the
rose
and
azure
traced
in
the
dragon
form
upon
the
white
curve
of
the
arm
ah
curb
thyself
my
fancy
where
thou
drift
in
this
enchanted
flight
feroza
the
evening
sky
was
as
green
as
jade
as
emerald
turf
by
lotus
lake
behind
the
kafila
far
she
strayed
the
pearls
are
lost
if
the
necklace
break
a
lingering
freshness
touched
the
air
from
clustered
around
a
spring
the
great
grim
desert
lay
vast
and
bare
but
youth
is
ever
a
careless
thing
the
raiders
threw
her
upon
the
sand
men
of
the
wilderness
know
no
laws
they
tore
the
amethysts
off
her
hand
and
rent
the
folds
of
her
veiling
gauze
they
struck
the
lips
that
they
might
have
kissed
pitiless
they
to
her
pain
and
fear
and
wrenched
the
gold
from
her
broken
wrist
no
use
to
cry
there
were
none
to
hear
her
scarlet
mouth
and
her
onyx
eyes
her
braided
hair
in
its
silken
sheen
were
surely
meet
for
a
lover
prize
but
fate
dissented
and
stepped
between
across
the
zenith
the
vultures
fly
cruel
of
beak
and
heavy
of
wing
thus
it
was
written
that
she
should
die
inshallah
death
is
a
transient
thing
this
month
the
almonds
bloom
at
kandahar
i
hate
this
city
seated
on
the
plain
the
clang
and
clamour
of
the
hot
bazar
knowing
amid
the
pauses
of
my
pain
this
month
the
almonds
bloom
in
kandahar
the
that
sheltered
my
delight
screening
my
happiness
as
evening
fell
it
was
well
worth
that
most
enchanted
night
this
life
in
torment
and
the
next
in
hell
people
are
kind
to
me
one
more
than
kind
her
lashes
lie
like
fans
upon
her
cheek
but
kindness
is
a
burden
on
my
mind
and
it
is
weariness
to
hear
her
speak
for
though
that
kaffir
bullet
holds
me
here
my
thoughts
are
ever
free
and
wander
far
to
where
the
lilac
hills
rise
soft
and
clear
beyond
the
almond
groves
of
kandahar
he
followed
me
to
sibi
to
the
fair
the
where
he
shot
me
weeks
ago
but
since
they
fettered
him
i
have
no
care
that
my
returning
steps
to
health
are
slow
they
will
not
loose
him
till
they
know
my
fate
and
i
rest
here
till
i
am
strong
to
slay
meantime
my
heart
delight
may
safely
wait
among
the
almond
blossoms
sweet
as
they
that
cursed
kaffir
well
he
won
by
day
but
i
won
what
i
so
desired
by
night
arms
held
what
his
lack
till
judgment
day
also
the
game
is
not
yet
over
quite
wait
amir
ali
wait
till
i
come
forth
to
kill
before
the
are
green
to
raze
thy
very
memory
from
the
north
that
thou
art
not
and
thou
hast
not
been
aha
friend
amir
ali
it
is
duty
to
rid
the
world
from
shiah
dogs
like
thee
they
are
but
moles
on
islam
beauty
such
as
the
faithful
can
not
calmly
see
also
thy
bullet
hurts
me
not
a
little
thy
shiah
blood
might
serve
to
salve
the
maybe
some
afghan
promises
are
brittle
never
a
promise
to
oneself
to
kill
now
i
grow
stronger
i
have
days
of
leisure
to
shape
my
coming
vengeance
as
i
lie
and
undisturbed
by
call
of
war
or
pleasure
can
dream
of
many
ways
a
man
may
die
i
shall
not
torture
thee
thy
friends
might
rally
some
fate
assist
thee
and
prove
false
to
me
oh
shouldst
thou
now
escape
me
amir
ali
this
would
torment
me
through
eternity
aye
i
will
be
quiet
indeed
give
here
the
hakim
powder
if
thou
wilt
and
thou
mayst
sit
for
i
perceive
thy
need
and
rest
thy
head
upon
my
quilt
thy
gentle
love
will
not
disturb
a
mind
that
loves
and
hates
beneath
a
fiercer
star
also
thou
my
heart
is
left
behind
among
the
of
kandahar
