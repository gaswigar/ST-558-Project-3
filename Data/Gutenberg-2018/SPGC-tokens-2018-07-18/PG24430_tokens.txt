note

uncle
remus
is
a
dearly
loved
by
children
besides
that
it
is
an
important
contribution
to
the
study
of

through
many
years
of
popularity
it
has
carried
a
long
and
learned
introduction
of
great
interest
to
students
but
rather
forbidding
in
aspect
to
youthful
readers
in
this
new
edition
which
has
been
prepared
especially
for
children
and
illustrated
in
colors
by
an
artist
who
knows
how
to
please
them
as
well
as
their
elders
the
introduction
has
been
omitted
but
the
stories
and
their
charming
setting
have
been
left

nights
with
uncle
remus
i
fox
and
miss
goose
it
had
been
raining
all
day
so
that
uncle
remus
found
it
impossible
to
go
out
the
storm
had
begun
the
old
man
declared
just
as
the
chickens
were
crowing
for
day
and
it
had
continued
almost
without
intermission
the
dark
gray
clouds
had
blotted
out
the
sun
and
the
leafless
limbs
of
the
tall
oaks
surrendered
themselves
drearily
to
the
fantastic
gusts
that
drove
the
drizzle
fitfully
before
them
the
lady
to
whom
uncle
remus
belonged
had
been
thoughtful
of
the
old
man
and
the
had
been
commissioned
to
carry
him
his
meals
this
arrangement
came
to
the
knowledge
of
the
little
boy
at
supper
time
and
he
lost
no
time
in
obtaining
permission
to
accompany
uncle
remus
made
a
great
demonstration
over
the
thoughtful
kindness
of
his
miss
sally
ef
she
ai
one
blessid
he
said
in
his
simple
fervent
way
den
dey
ai
none
un
um
in
deze
parts
with
that
he
addressed
himself
to
the
supper
while
the
little
boy
sat
by
and
eyed
him
with
that
familiar
curiosity
common
to
children
finally
the
youngster
disturbed
the
old
man
with
an
inquiry

the
culmination
was
hardly
sensational
enough
to
win
the
hearty
applause
of
the
little

and
this
fact
appeared
to
have
a
depressing
influence
upon

is
a
sound
that
might
be
identified
with
one
of

but
it
is
palpable

may
be
used
to
have
attracted
the
attention
of

humble
philosophers
of

the
story
of

uncle
remus
relapsed
into
silence
again
and
the
little
boy
with
nothing
better
to
do
turned
his
attention
to
the
bench
upon
which
the
old
man
kept
his
shoemaker
tools
prosecuting
his
investigations
in
this
direction
the
youngster
finally
suggested

disappearing

suddenly

unexpectedly
as

the

where
and
how
the
bristle
famine
occurred
i

the

declared
but
the
little

insisted
that
he
had
never

about

before
and
he
was
so
persistent
that
at

uncle

asked
the
little

his
thoughts
apparently
dwelling
upon
the
new
accomplishment
of
brother

at
which
the
old
man
had
hinted
in
his
story
of
benjamin
ram
uncle
remus
pretended
to
be
greatly
surprised
that
any
one
could
be
so
unfamiliar
with
the
accomplishments
of
brother
rabbit
as
to
venture
to
ask
such
a
question
his
response
was
in
the
nature
of

xi
how
rooster
lost
his
dinner
it
seemed
that
the
rainy
season
had
set
in
in
earnest
but
the
little
boy
went
down
to
uncle
remus
cabin
before
dark
in
some
mysterious
way
it
appeared
to
the
child
the
gloom
of
twilight
fastened
itself
upon
the
dusky
clouds
and
the
great
trees
without
and
the
dismal
perspective
beyond
gradually
became
one
with
the
darkness
uncle
remus
had
thoughtfully
placed
a
tin
pan
under
a
leak
in
the
roof
and
the
of
the
water
as
it
fell
in
the
resonant
vessel
made
a
not
unmusical
accompaniment
to
the
storm
the
old
man
fumbled
around
under
his
bed
and
presently
dragged
forth
a
large
bag
filled
with
lightwood
knots
which
with
an
instinctive
economy
in
this
particular
direction
he
had
stored
away
for
an
emergency
a
bright
but
flickering
flame
was
the
result
of
this
timely
discovery
and
the
effect
it
produced
was
quite
in
keeping
with
all
the
surroundings
the
rain
and
wind
and
darkness
held
sway
without
while
within
the
unsteady
lightwood
blaze
seemed
to
rhyme
with
the
in
the
pan
sometimes
the
shadow
of
uncle
remus
as
he
leaned
over
the
hearth
would
tower
and
fill
the
cabin
and
again
it
would
fade
and
disappear
among
the
swaying
and
swinging
cobwebs
that
curtained
the
rafters

dat
i
is
this
was
method
of
renewing
peaceful
relations
with
uncle

the
old
man
was
disposed
to
resist

brer
rabbit
breaks
up
a
party
as
long
as
uncle
remus
allowed
to
remain
in
the
cabin
the
little
boy
was
not
particularly
interested
in
preventing
the
perfunctory
abuse
which
the
old
man
might
feel
disposed
to
bestow
upon
the
complacent
girl
the
truth
is
the
child
mind
was
occupied
with
the
episode
in
the
story
of
benjamin
ram
which
treats
of
the
style
in
which
this
romantic
old
wag
put
and
wolf
to
flight
by
playing
a
tune
upon
his
fiddle
the
little
boy
was
particularly
struck
with
this
remarkable
feat
as
many
a
youngster
before
him
had
been
and
he
made
bold
to
recur
to
it
again
by
asking
uncle
remus
for
all
the
details
it
was
plain
to
the
latter
that
the
child
regarded
ram
as
the
typical
hero
of
all
the
animals
and
this
was
by
no
means
gratifying
to
the
old
man
he
answered
the
little
boy
questions
as
well
as
he
could
and
when
nothing
more
remained
to
be
said
about
ram
he
settled
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
resumed
the
curious
history
of
brother
rabbit
ram
mighty
smart
man
i
ai
dat

xiii
brer
fox
brer
rabbit
and
king
deer
daughter
notwithstanding
brother
rabbit
success
with
the
drum
the
little
boy
was
still
inclined
to
refer
to
benjamin
ram
and
his
fiddle
but
uncle
remus
was
not
by
any
means
willing
that
such
an
ancient
vagabond
as
ram
should
figure
as
a
hero
and
he
said
that
while
it
was
possible
that
brother
rabbit
was
no
great
hand
with
the
fiddle
he
was
a
drummer
and
a
capital
singer
to
boot
furthermore
uncle
remus
declared
that
brother
rabbit
could
perform
upon
the
quills
an
accomplishment
to
which
none
of
the
other
animals
could
lay
claim
there
was
a
time
too
the
old
man
pointedly
suggested
when
the
romantic
rascal
used
his
musical
abilities
to
win
the
smiles
of
a
nice
young
lady
of
quality
no
less
a
personage
indeed
than
king
deer
daughter
as
a
matter
of
course
the
little
boy
was
anxious
to
hear
the
particulars

loath

give
them

the
old
man
folded
his
hands
in
his
lap
and
sat
quietly
gazing
into
the
lightwood
fire
presently
he
said
i

vittels
thereupon
uncle
remus
arose
shook
himself
peered
out
into
the
night
to
discover
that
the
rain
had
nearly
ceased
and
then
made
ready
to
carry
the
little
boy
to
his
mother
long
before
the
chickens
had
crowed
for
midnight
the
child
as
well
as
the
old
man
had
been
transported
to
the
land
where
myths
and
fables
cease
to
be
wonderful
the
land
of
pleasant
dreams
footnotes
an
allusion
to
the
primitive
mode
of
cleaning
hogs
by
heating
rocks
and
placing
them
in
a
barrel
or
tank
of
water
this
word
lonesome
as
used
by
the
negroes
is
the
equivalent
of
thrilling
romantic
and
in
that
sense
is
very
expressive
an
inquiry
after
his
health
another
form
is
how
does
corporosity
seem
ter
segashuate
exercise
himself
xvi
how
brer
fox
failed
to
get
his
grapes
one
night
the
little
boy
failed
to
make
his
appearance
at
the
accustomed
hour
and
the
next
morning
the
intelligence
that
the
child
was
sick
went
forth
from
the
big
house
uncle
remus
was
told
that
it
had
been
necessary
during
the
night
to
call
in
two
physicians
when
this
information
was
imparted
to
the
old
man
there
was
an
expression
upon
his
countenance
of
awe
not
unmixed
with
indignation
he
gave
vent
to
the
latter
dar

but
no
appeal
of
this
nature
was
made
to
uncle
remus
the
illness
of
the
little
boy
was
severe
but
not
fatal
he
took
his
medicine
and
improved
until
finally
even
the
doctors
pronounced
him
convalescent
but
he
was
very
weak
and
it
was
a
fortnight
before
he
was
permitted
to
leave
his
bed
he
was
restless
and
yet
his
term
of
imprisonment
was
full
of
pleasure
every
night
after
supper
uncle
remus
would
creep
softly
into
the
back
piazza
place
his
hat
carefully
on
the
floor
rap
gently
on
the
door
by
way
of
announcement
and
so
pass
into
the
nursery
how
patient
his
vigils
how
tender
his
ministrations
only
the
mother
of
the
little
boy
knew
how
comfortable
and
refreshing
the
change
from
the
bed
to
the
strong
arms
of
uncle
remus
only
the
little
boy
could
say
almost
the
first
manifestation
of
the
child
convalescence
was
the
renewal
of
his
interest
in
the
wonderful
adventures
of
brother
rabbit
brother
fox
and
the
other
brethren
who
flourished
in
that
strange
past
over
which
this
modern
æsop
had
thrown
the
veil
of
fable
miss
sally
as
uncle
remus
called
the
little
boy
mother
sitting
in
an
adjoining
room
heard
the
youngster
pleading
for
a
story
and
after
a
while
she
heard
the
old
man
clear
up
his
throat
with
a
great
affectation
of
formality
and
begin
dey

quiet
until

held
the

for
him
to
get
down

in
sympathy
with

fragments
of
a
song
occasionally
he
would
feel
of
the
edge
of
the

with
his
thumb
and
then
begin
to

again
the
comical

of

venerable

its
effect
upon
the
child

broke
into
a

peal
of
laughter

stopped
shaking
his

xxv
african
jack
usually
the
little
boy
who
regarded
himself
as
uncle
remus
partner
was
not
at
all
pleased
when
he
found
the
old
man
entertaining
in
his
simple
way
any
of
his
colored
friends
but
he
was
secretly
delighted
when
he
called
one
night
and
found
daddy
jack
sitting
by
uncle
hearth
daddy
jack
was
an
object
of
curiosity
to
older
people
than
the
little
boy
he
was
a
genuine
african
and
for
that
reason
he
was
known
as
african
jack
though
the
child
had
been
taught
to
call
him
daddy
jack
he
was
brought
to
georgia
in
a
when
he
was
about
twenty
years
old
and
remained
upon
one
of
the
for
several
years
finally
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
family
of
which
uncle
little
partner
was
the
youngest
representative
and
became
the
trusted
foreman
of
a
plantation
in
the
southern
part
of
georgia
known
as
the
walthall
place
once
every
year
he
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
the
home
place
in
middle
georgia
and
it
was
during
one
of
these
annual
visits
that
the
little
boy
found
him
in
uncle
remus
cabin
daddy
jack
appeared
to
be
quite
a
hundred
years
old
but
he
was
probably
not
more
than
eighty
he
was
a
little
old
man
whose
weazened
dwarfish
appearance
while
it
was
calculated
to
inspire
awe
in
the
minds
of
the
superstitious
was
not
without
its
pathetic
suggestions
the
child
had
been
told
that
the
old
african
was
a
wizard
a
conjurer
and
a
but
he
was
not
afraid
for
in
any
event
conjuration
witchcraft
or
what
not
he
was
assured
of
the
protection
of
uncle
remus
as
the
little
boy
entered
the
cabin
uncle
remus
smiled
and
nodded
pleasantly
and
made
a
place
for
him
on
a
little
stool
upon
which
had
been
piled
the
odds
and
ends
of
work
daddy
jack
paid
no
attention
to
the
child
his
thoughts
seemed
to
be
elsewhere
go

daddy

the
little
boy
did
as
he
was
bid
but
daddy
jack
grunted
ungraciously
and
made
no
response
to
the
salutation
he
was
evidently
not
fond
of
children
uncle
remus
glanced
curiously
at
the
dwarfed
and
withered
figure
and
spoke
a
little
more
emphatically
brer
jack
ef
you
take
good
look

deze
many
long

go
up
dar
honey
whar
daddy
jack
kin
see
you
the
child
went
shyly
up
to
the
old
african
and
stood
at
his
knee
the
sorrows
and
perplexities
of
nearly
a
hundred
years
lay
between
them
and
now
as
always
the
baffled
eyes
of
age
gazed
into
the
face
of
youth
as
if
by
this
means
to
unravel
the
mysteries
of
the
past
and
solve
the
problems
of
the
future
daddy
jack
took
the
plump
rosy
hands
of
the
little
boy
in
his
black
withered
ones
and
gazed
into
his
face
so
long
and
steadily
and
with
such
curious
earnestness
that
the
child
did
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
presently
the
old
african
flung
his
hands
to
his
head
and
rocked
his
body
from
side
to
side
moaning
and
mumbling
and
talking
to
himself
while
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
like
rain

ceased

and
his
moaning
and
his
crying
and
sat
gazing
wistfully
into
the
fireplace
whatever
he
saw
there
fixed
his
attention
for
uncle
remus
spoke
to
him
several
times
without
receiving
a

the

understood
this
rapidly
spoken
lingo
perfectly
well
but
he
would
have
laughed
anyhow
for
there
was
more
than
a
suggestion
of
the
comic
in
the
shrewd
seriousness
that
seemed
to
focus
itself
in
daddy
jack
pinched
and
wrinkled

uncle

looking

with
an
air
of
superiority
daddy
jack
shut
his
shrewd
little
eyes
tightly
and
held
them
so
as
if
by
that
means
to

to

daddy
jack
immensely
he
rubbed
his
withered
hands
together
smacked
his
lips
and
chuckled
after
a
few
restless
movements
he
got
up
and
went
shuffling
to
the
door
his
quick
short
steps
causing
uncle
remus
to

while
the
little
boy
was
endeavoring
to
get
uncle
remus
to
explain
the
nature
of
daddy
jack
grievances
muffled
laughter
was
heard
outside
and
almost
immediately
rushed
in
the
door
flung
herself
upon
the
floor
and
rolled
and
laughed
until
apparently
she
could
laugh
no
more
then
she
seemed
to
grow
severely
angry
she
arose
from
the
floor
and
flopped
herself
down
in
a
chair
and
glared
at
uncle
remus
with
indignation
in
her
eyes
as
soon
as
she
could
control
her
inflamed
feelings
she
cried
wat

uncle
remus
made
no
direct
response
but
he
leaned
over
reached
out
his
hand
and
picked
up
an
unfinished
that
stood
in
the
corner
then
he
took
the
little
boy
by
the
arm
and
pushed
him
out
of
the
way
saying
in
his
gentlest
and
most
persuasive
tone

uncle
remus
movements
and
remarks
had
a
wonderful
effect
on
her
anger
disappeared
her
eyes
lost
their
malignant
expression
and
her
voice
fell
to
a
conversational
tone
now
unk

and

her

remembrance
of

exclaimed
disdainfully
i
des
up
en
tole
he
foolin
wid
de
wrong
nigger
would
have
continued
her
narration
but
just
at
that
moment
the
shuffling
of
feet
was
heard
outside
and
daddy
jack
came
in
puffing
and
blowing
and
smiling
evidently
he
had
been
hunting
for
in
every
house
in
the
negro
quarter
hi
he
exclaimed

all
this
time
daddy
jack
was
slowly
approaching
bowing
and
smiling
and
looking
quite
dandified
as
uncle
remus
afterward
said
just
as
the
old
african
was
about
to
lay
hands
upon
she
made
a
rush
for
the
door
the
movement
was
so
unexpected
that
daddy
jack
was
upset
he
fell
upon
uncle
remus
and
then
rolled
off
on
the
floor
where
he
lay
clutching
at
the
air
and
talking
so
rapidly
that
nobody
could
understand
a
word
he
said
uncle
remus
lifted
him
to
his
feet
with
much
dignity
and
it
soon
became
apparent
that
he
was
neither
hurt
nor
angry
the
little
boy
laughed
immoderately
and
he
was
still
laughing
when
put
her
head
in
the
door
and
exclaimed
unk
remus
i
ai
kilt
dat

chuckled
and
patted
himself
on
the
knee
as
he
cried
come

talking
to
herself

nodded
assent
and
the
little
boy
ran
laughing
to
the
big
house
xxvi
why
the
alligator
back
is
rough
the
night
after
the
violent
flirtation
between
daddy
jack
and
the
latter
coaxed
and
bribed
the
little
boy
to
wait
until
she
had
finished
her
work
about
the
house
after
she
had
set
things
to
rights
in
the
and
elsewhere
she
took
the
child
by
the
hand
and
together
they
went
to
uncle
remus
cabin
the
old
man
was
making
a
of
shucks
and
grass
and
splits
and
daddy

made

he
sat
with

and
paid
no

to
after
awhile
the
little
boy
grew
restless
and
presently
he
said

daddy
jack
paused
to
wipe
his
face
he
had
reported
the
dialogue
between
brother
rabbit
and
brother
alligator
with
considerable
animation
and
had
illustrated
it
as
he
went
along
with
many
curious
inflections
of
the
voice
and
many
queer
gestures
of
head
and
hands
impossible
to

the
made
such
a
terrible
report
of
the
carryings
on
of
daddy
jack
that
the
little
boy
mother
thought
it
prudent
not
to
allow
him
to
visit
uncle
remus
so
often
the
child
amused
himself
as
best
he
could
for
several
nights
but
his
and
finally
lost
their
interest
he
cried
so
hard
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
see
uncle
remus
that
his
mother
placed
him
under
the
care
of
aunt
tempy
a
woman
of
large
authority
on
the
place
and
who
stood
next
to
uncle

confidence
of
her
mistress

a
fat
woman
who
always
wore
a
and
kept
her
sleeves
rolled
up
displaying
her
plump
black
arms
winter
and
summer
she
never
hesitated
to
exercise
her
authority
and
the
younger
negroes
on
the
place
regarded
her
as
a
tyrant
but
in
spite
of
her
loud
voice
and
brusque
manners
she
was
thoroughly
usually
and
always
trustworthy
aunt
tempy
and
uncle
remus
were
secretly
jealous
of
each
other
but
they
were
careful
never
to
come
in
conflict
and
to
all
appearances
the
most
cordial
relations
existed
between

the

to
have
his
venerable
partner
all
to
himself
uncle

was
engaged
in
hunting
for
tobacco
crumbs
with
which
to

curiously

was
in
thorough
sympathy
with
all
the
superstitions
of

to
him
the
rabbit
foot
appeared
to
be
an
uncanny
affair

to
say
that
it
was
bedtime

shortly
afterward
the

was
dreaming
that
daddy
jack
was
in
disguise
footnotes
disease
if
as
some
ethnologists
claim
the
animal
myths
are
relics
of
zoötheism
there
can
scarcely
be
a
doubt
that
the
practice
here
described
by
uncle
remus
is
the
survival
of
some
sort
of
obeisance
or
genuflexion
by
which
the
negroes
recognized
the
presence
of
the
rabbit
the
great
central
figure
and
of
african
mythology
never
mind
sometime
any
time
no

aunt
tempy
was
transforming

for
some
of
the
little
negroes
a
piece
of
economy
of
her

devising

gets
in
trouble
when
uncle
remus
began
his
story
of
billy

and
miss
janey
daddy
jack
sat
perfectly
quiet
his
eyes
were
shut
and
he
seemed
to
be
dozing
but
as
the
story
proceeded
he
grew
more
and
more
restless
several
times
he
was
upon
the
point
of
interrupting
uncle
remus
but
he
restrained
himself
he
raised
his
hands
to
a
level
with
his
chin
and
beat
the
ends
of
his
fingers
gently
together
apparently
keeping
time
to
his
own
thoughts
but
his
impatience
exhausted
itself
and
when
uncle
remus
had
concluded
the
old
african
was
as
quiet
as
ever
when
brother
fox
was
left
so
unceremoniously
to

fate

footnotes
a
mixture
of
complacent
and
placid
accent
on
the
second
syllable
a
version
of
this
story
makes
brother
rabbit
capture
a
swarm
of
bees
tuggle
of
georgia
who
has
made
an
exhaustive
study
of
the
creek
indians
has
discovered
a
variant
of
the
legend
the
rabbit
chufee
becomes
alarmed
because
he
has
nothing
but
the
nimbleness
of
his
feet
to
take
him
out
of
harm
way
he
goes
to
his
creator
and
begs
that
greater
intelligence
be
bestowed
upon
him
thereupon
the
snake
test
is
applied
as
in
the
negro
story
and
the
rabbit
also
catches
a
swarm
of
gnats
he
is
then
told
that
he
has
as
much
intelligence
as
there
is
any
need
for
and
he
goes
away

uncle

said
the
little
boy
one
night
when
he
found
the
old
man
sitting
alone
in
his
cabin
did
you
ever
see
uncle
remus
placed
his
elbows
on
his
knees
rested
his
chin
in
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
gazed
steadily
in
the
fire
presently
he
said
wen

the
result
of
this
explanation
was
that
the
child
did
know
whether
uncle
remus
had
seen
the
or
not
but
his
sympathies
led
him
to
suspect
that
the
old
man
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
all
her
movements
uncle
remus
the
little
boy
said
after
a
while
if
there

continued
uncle

who

illustrations
of

while

known
simply
as
a
crank
the
information
in

is
imparted
in
a
low
impressive
confidential
tone
is
it
necessary
to
say
that
the
wiggletail
is
the
embryo
mosquito
galloping
g
hard
as
in
give
this
story
the
funniest
and
most
characteristic
of
all
the
negro
legends
can
not
be
satisfactorily
told
on
paper
it
is
full
of
action
and
all
the
interest
centres
in
the
gestures
and
grimaces
that
must
accompany
an
explanation
of
brother
rabbit
method
of
disposing
of
the
mosquitoes
the
story
was
first
called
to
my
attention
by
marion
erwin
of
savannah
and
it
is
properly
a
coast
legend
but
i
have
heard
it
told
by
three
middle
georgia
negroes
xxxviii
the
pimmerly
plum
one
night
when
the
little
boy
had
grown
tired
of
waiting
for
a
story
he
looked
at
uncle
remus
and
said
i
wonder
what
ever
became
of
old
brother
tarrypin
uncle
remus
gave
a
sudden
start
glanced
all
around
the
cabin
and
then
broke
into
a
laugh
that
ended
in
a
yell
like
a
well

the

when

went
off
into
these
rhapsodies
however
nonsensical
they
might
seem
to
others
to
the
child
they
were
positively
thrilling

the

laughed
but
it
was
plain
that

to
cast
longing
looks
at
the

longingly
at

and
uncle
remus
leaned
forward
and
touched
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
it
was
a
familiar
gesture
gentle
and
yet
rough
a
token
of
affection
and
yet
a
command
to
attention
for
the
venerable
darkey
could
be
imperious
enough
when
surrendering
to
the
whims
of
his
little
partner

familiar
climax
the

mumble
to
himself
in
a
lingo
which
might
have
been
understood
on

guinea

which
sounded
out
of

in

the
little

observed
that
aunt
tempy
was
very
much
interested
in
daddy
jack
story
she
made
no
remarks
while
the
old
african
was
telling
it
but
she
was
busily
engaged
in
measuring
imaginary
quilt
patterns
on
her
apron
with
her
thumb
and
forefinger
a
sure
sign
that
her
interest
had
been
aroused
when
daddy
jack
had
concluded
when
with
a
swift
sweeping
gesture
of
his
wrinkled
hand
he
cut
the
cord
and
allowed
brother
wolf
to
perish
ignominiously
aunt
tempy
drew
a
long
breath
and

end
of

he
placed
in

enclosing
the

in

by
sucking
the

through

and
regulating

the
fact
that
the

and
inquired
about
him
seemed
to
give
the
old
african
particular
pleasure
it
was
probably
a
new
experience
to
daddy
jack
and
it
vaguely
stirred
some
dim
instinct
in
his
bosom
that
impelled
him
to
greet
the
child
with
more
genuine
heartiness
than
he
had
ever
displayed
in
all
his
life
he
drew
the
little
boy
up

fragmentary
story
having
exhausted
itself
daddy
jack
turned
up
his
coat
collar
until
it
was
as
high
as
the
top
of
his

and
then
tried
to
button
it
under
his
chin
if
this
attempt
had
been
successful
the
old
african
would
have
presented
a
diabolical
appearance
but
the
coat
refused
to
be
buttoned
in
that
style
after
several

created

found
that
he
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
little
company
he
rubbed
his
chin
and
grinned
until
his
yellow
teeth
shone
in
the
firelight
like
those
of
some
wild
animal
while
his
small
eyes
glistened
under

heavy
lids

wanted

to
sing
some
more
but
before
the
old
man
could
either
consent
or
refuse
the
notes
of
a
horn
were
heard
in
the
distance
uncle
remus
lifted
his
hand
to
command
silence
and
bent
his
head
in
an
attitude
of
attention

a

was
by
no

unmusical
its
range
was
limited
but
in
plato
hands
its
few
notes
were
both
powerful
and
sweet
presently
the
wagon
arrived
and
for
a
few
minutes
all
was
confusion
the
negroes
on
the
home
place
running
to
greet
the
who
were
mostly
their
relatives
a
stranger
hearing
the
shouts
and
outcries
of
these
people
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
commotion
even
uncle
remus
went
to
his
cabin
door
and
with
the
little
boy
by
his
side
looked
out
upon
the
scene
a
tumult
lit
up
by
torches
of
resinous
pine
the
old
man
and
the
child
were
recognized
and
for
a
few
moments
the
air
was
filled
with
cries
of
howdy
unk
remus
howdy
little
marster
after
a
while
uncle
remus
closed
his
door
laid
away
his
tools
and
drew
his
chair
in
front
of
the
wide
hearth
the
child
went
and
stood
beside
him
leaning
his
head
against
the
old
negro
shoulder
and
the
two
old
age
and
youth
one
living
in
the
past
and
the
other
looking
forward
only
to
the
future
gazed
into
the
bed
of
glowing
embers
illuminated
by
a
thin
flickering
flame
probably
they
saw
nothing
there
each
being
busy
with
his
own
simple
thoughts
but
their
shadows
enlarged
out
of
all
proportion
and
looking
over
their
shoulders
from
the
wall
behind
them
must
have
seen
something
for
clinging
together
they
kept
up
a
most
incessant
pantomime
and
plato
horn
which
sounded
again
to
call
the
negroes
to
supper
after
their
journey
though
it
aroused
uncle
remus
and
the
child
from
the
contemplation
of
the
fire
had
no
perceptible
effect
upon
the
shadows

suddenly
slapped

the
arrival
of
the
negroes
from
the
river
place
added
greatly
to
the
enthusiasm
with
which
the
christmas
holidays
were
anticipated
on
the
home
place
and
the
air
was
filled
with
laughter
day
and
night
uncle
remus
appeared
to
be
very
busy
though
there
was
really
nothing
to
be
done
except
to
walk
around
and
scold
at
everybody
and
everything
in
a
way
and
this
the
old
man
could
do
to
perfection
the
night
before
christmas
eve
however
the
little
boy
saw
a
light
in
uncle
remus
cabin
and
he
interpreted
it
as
in
some
sort
a
signal
of
invitation
he
found
the
old
man
sitting
by
the
fire
and
talking
to
himself

would

kept
up

vague
complaints
but
right
in

of

daddy

stuck
his
head
in
at
the

and
said

uncle

looked
at
the
grinning
old
african
in
astonishment
then
suddenly
the
truth
dawned
upon
him
and
he
broke
into
a
loud
laugh
finally
he
said

a
somehow

failed
to

and
he
replied
with
some
display
of
irritation

this
philosophy
was
altogether
lost
upon
daddy
jack
who
took
the
shoes
and
shuffled
out
with
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
he
had
scarcely
got
out
of
hearing
before
pushed
the
door
open
and
came
in
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
seeing
that
uncle
remus
paid
no
attention
to
her
she
sat
down
and
picked
at
her
fingers
with
an
air
quite
in
contrast
to
her
usual
uppishness
as
uncle
remus
called
it
unk
remus
she
said
after
awhile
in
a
subdued
tone
is

old
affikin

something
in
uncle
remus
sympathetic
and
soothing
tone
seemed
to
exasperate
she
dropped
her
hands
in
her
lap
straightened
herself
up
and
exclaimed

much

um
evidently
expected
uncle
remus
to
make
some
characteristic
comment
for
she
sat
and
watched
him
with
her
lips
firmly
pressed
together
and
her
eyelids
an
attitude
of
defiance
significant
enough
when
seen
but
difficult
to
describe
but
the
old
man
made
no
response
to
the
challenge
he
seemed
to
be
very
busy
presently
went
on
somebody
bleedz
to
take

flounced
out
without
waiting
for
an
explanation
but
the
mention
of
brother
fox
attracted
the
attention
of
the
little
boy
and
he
wanted
to
know
what
was
in
the
bag
how
it
came
to
be
there
and
all
about

down
upon
his
knee
with
a
thump
that
jarred
the
and
cups
on
the
and
then
looked
around
with
a
severe
frown
to
see
what
the
chairs
and
the
and
the
walls
and
the
rafters
had
to
say
in
response
to
his
remarkable
argument
he
sat
thus
in
a
waiting
attitude
a
moment
and
then
finding
that
no
response
came
from
anything
or
anybody
his
brow
gradually
cleared
and
a
smile
of
mingled
pride
and
satisfaction
spread
over

he
wo

termorrer
night
the
hint
was
sufficient
and
the
little
boy
ran
out
laughing
lxxi
the
night
before
christmas
the
day
and
the
night
before
christmas
were
full
of
pleasure
for
the
little
boy
there
was
pleasure
in
the
big
house
and
pleasure
in
the
humble
cabins
in
the
quarters
the
peculiar
manner
in
which
the
negroes
celebrated
the
beginning
of
the
holidays
was
familiar
to
the
experience
but
strange
to
his
appreciation
and
he
enjoyed
everything
he
saw
and
heard
with
the
ready
delight
of
his
years
a
delight
which
in
this
instance
had
been
trained
and
sharpened
if
the
expression
may
be
used
in
the
small
world
over
which
uncle
remus
presided
the
little
boy
had
a
special
invitation
to
be
present
at
the
marriage
of
daddy
jack
and
and
he
went
accompanied
by
uncle
remus
and
aunt
tempy
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
curious
affair
but
its
incongruities
made
small
impression
upon
the
mind
of
the
child
wore
a
white
dress
and
had
a
wreath
of
artificial
flowers
in
her
hair
daddy
jack
wore
a
high
hat
which
he
persisted
in
keeping
on
his
head
during
the
ceremony
and
a
coat
the
tails
of
which
nearly
dragged
the
floor
his
bright
little
eyes
glistened
triumphantly
and
he
grinned
and
bowed
to
everybody
again
and
again
after
it
was
all
over
the
guests
partook
of
cake
baked
by
aunt
tempy
and
persimmon
beer
brewed
by
uncle
remus
it
seemed
however
that
was
not
perfectly
happy
for
in
response
to
a
question
asked
by
aunt
tempy
she
said

miss
sally
set
down
in
en
wish
fer
many
de
time
this
was
grievance
the
idea
that
some
one
could
be
found
to
fill
her
place
and
it
is
a
grievance
with
which
people
of
greater
importance
than
the
humble
negro
are
more
or
less
familiar
but
the
preparations
for
the
holidays
went
on
in
spite
of
grievance
a
large
platform
used
for
sunning
wheat
and
seed
cotton
was
arranged
by
the
negroes
for
their
dance
and
several
of
resinous
pine
known
as
lightwood
were
placed
around
about
it
in
little
heaps
so
that
the
occasion
might
lack
no
element
of
brilliancy
at
nightfall
the
heaps
of
lightwood
were
set
on
fire
and
the
little
boy
who
was
waiting
impatiently
for
uncle
remus
to
come
for
him
could
hear
the
negroes
singing
dancing
and
laughing
he
was
just
ready
to
cry
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
venerable
partner
is
dey
passenger
anywhar
yer
fer
thumptown
de
stage
done
ready
en
de
hosses
ef
dey
passenger
yer
i

des
better

makin
ready
fer

the
old
man
walked
up
to
the
back
piazza
as
he
spoke
held
out
his
strong
arms
and
the
little
boy
jumped
into
them
with
an
exclamation
of
delight
the
child
mother
gave
uncle
remus
a
shawl
to
wrap
around
the
child
and
this
shawl
was
the
cause
of
considerable
trouble
for
the
youngster
persisted
in
wrapping
it
around
the
old
man
head
and
so
blinding
him
that
there
was
danger
of
his
falling
finally
he
put
the
little
boy
down
took
off
his
hat
raised
his
right
hand
and
said
now
den
i

is
dat
whar
i
uncle
remus
started
to
the
house
with
an
exaggerated
vigor
of
movement
comical
to
behold
but
however
comical
it
may
have
been
it
had
its
effect
the
little
boy
ran
after
him
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
made
him
stop
now
uncle
remus
do
go
back
i
was
just
playing
uncle
remus
anger
was
all
pretence
but
he
managed
to
make
it
very
impressive

the

who
had
tactics
of
his
own
if
i
ca

with
you
i
do
know
who
i
am
to
play
with
this
touched
uncle
remus
in
a
very
tender
spot
he
stopped
in
the
path
took
off
his
spectacles
wiped
the
glasses
on
his
and
said
very
emphatically
now
den
honey

er
my
head
en
broke
my
neck
en
yone
too
the
child
promised
that
he
would
be
very
good
and
uncle
remus
picked
him
up
and
the
two
made
their
way
to
where
the
negroes
had
congregated
they
were
greeted
with
cries
of
dar
unk
remus
howdy
unk
remus
yer
dey
is
ole
man
remus
do

but
he
do
sing
gentermens
des
go

and
much
more
so
that
when
uncle
remus
had
placed
the
little
boy
upon
a
corner
of
the
platform
and
made
him
comfortable
he
straightened
himself
with
a
laugh
and
cried
out
howdy
boys
howdy
all
i
des

some
one
said
now
des
hush
en
let
unk
remus
exclaimed
another
the
figure
of
the
old
man
as
he
stood
smiling
upon
the
crowd
of
negroes
was
picturesque
in
the
extreme
he
seemed
to
be
taller
than
all
the
rest
and
notwithstanding
his
venerable
appearance
he
moved
and
spoke
with
all
the
vigor
of
youth
he
had
always
exercised
authority
over
his
he
had
been
the
captain
of
the
the
stoutest
at
the
the
swiftest
with
the
hoe
the
neatest
with
the
plough
and
the
plantation
hands
still
looked
upon
him
as
their
leader
some
negro
from
the
river
place
had
brought
a
fiddle
and
though
it
was
a
very
feeble
one
its
screeching
seemed
to
annoy
uncle
remus
put
up
dat
ar
fiddle
he
exclaimed
waving
his
hand
des

so
said
the
man
with
the
fiddle
and
the
irritating
instrument
was
laid
aside
now
den
uncle
remus
went
on
dey
a
little

yer

you

unk
remus
you
des

en
we
foller
thereupon
the
old
man
called
to
the
best
singers
among
the
negroes
and
made
them
stand
near
him
then
he
raised
his
right
hand
to
his
ear
and
stood
perfectly
still
the
little
boy
thought
he
was
listening
for
something
but
presently
uncle
remus
began
to
slap
himself
gently
with
his
left
hand
first
upon
the
leg
and
then
upon
the
breast
the
other
negroes
kept
time
to
this
by
a
gentle
motion
of
their
feet
and
finally
when
the
thump
thump
thump
of
this
movement
had
regulated
itself
to
suit
the
old
man
fancy
he
broke
out
with
what
may
be
called
a
christmas
dance
song
his
voice
was
strong
and
powerful
and
sweet
and
its
range
was
as
astonishing
as
its
volume
more
than
this
the
melody
to
which
he
tuned
it
and
which
was
caught
up
by
a
hundred
voices
almost
as
sweet
and
as
powerful
as
his
own
was
charged
with
a
mysterious
and
pathetic
tenderness
the
fine
company
of
men
and
women
at
the
big
house
men
and
women
who
had
made
the
tour
of
all
the
capitals
of
europe
listened
with
swelling
hearts
and
with
tears
in
their
eyes
as
the
song
rose
and
fell
upon
the
air
at
one
moment
a
tempest
of
melody
at
another
a
strain
breathed
softly
and
sweetly
to
the
gentle
winds
the
song
that
the
little
boy
and
the
fine
company
heard
was
something
like
this
ridiculous
enough
when
put
in
cold
type
but
powerful
and
thrilling
when

the
melody

the
negroes

invested

after
a
while
the
song
was
done
and
other
songs
were
sung
but
it
was
not
long
before
uncle
remus
discovered
that
the
little
boy
was
fast
asleep
the
old
man
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
to
the
big
house
singing
softly
in
his
ear
all
the
way
and
somehow
or
other
the
song
seemed
to
melt
and
mingle
in
the
youngster
dreams
he
thought
he
was
floating
in
the
air
while
somewhere
near
all
the
negroes
were
singing
uncle
remus
voice
above
all
the
rest
and
then
after
he
had
found
a
upon
a
soft
warm
bank
of
clouds
he
thought
he
heard
the
songs
renewed
they
grew
fainter
and
fainter
in
his
dreams
until
at
last
it
seemed
uncle
remus
leaned
over
him
and
sang

inconsistencies

dialect
found
in
the
