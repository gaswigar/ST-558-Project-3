i
a
street
a
few
wayfarers
and
a
city
guard
first
man
ho
sir
city
guard
what
do
you
want
second
man
which
way
should
we
go
we
are
strangers
here
please
tell
us
which
street
we
should
take
city
guard
where
do
you
want
to
go
third
man
to
where
those
big
festivities
are
going
to
be
held
you
know
which
way
do
we
go
city
guard
one
street
is
quite
as
good
as
another
here
any
street
will
lead
you
there
go
straight
ahead
and
you
can
not
miss
the
place
exit
first
man
just
hear
what
the
fool
says
any
street
will
lead
you
there
where
then
would
be
the
sense
of
having
so
many
streets
second
man
you
need
be
so
awfully
put
out
at
that
my
man
a
country
is
free
to
arrange
its
affairs
in
its
own
way
as
for
roads
in
our
country
well
they
are
as
good
as
narrow
and
crooked
lanes
a
labyrinth
of
ruts
and
tracks
our
king
does
not
believe
in
open
thoroughfares
he
thinks
that
streets
are
just
so
many
openings
for
his
subjects
to
fly
away
from
his
kingdom
it
is
quite
the
contrary
here
nobody
stands
in
your
way
nobody
objects
to
your
going
elsewhere
if
you
like
to
and
yet
the
people
are
far
from
deserting
this
kingdom
with
such
streets
our
country
would
certainly
have
been
depopulated
in
no
time
first
man
my
dear
janardan
i
have
always
noticed
that
this
is
a
great
fault
in
your
character
janardan
what
is
first
man
that
you
are
always
having
a
fling
at
your
country
how
can
you
think
that
open
highways
may
be
good
for
a
country
look
here
kaundilya
here
is
a
man
who
actually
believes
that
open
highways
are
the
salvation
of
a
country
kaundilya
there
is
no
need
bhavadatta
of
my
pointing
out
afresh
that
janardan
is
blessed
with
an
intelligence
which
is
remarkably
crooked
which
is
sure
to
land
him
in
danger
some
day
if
the
king
comes
to
hear
of
our
worthy
friend
he
will
make
it
a
pretty
hard
job
for
him
to
find
any
one
to
do
him
his
funeral
rites
when
he
is
dead
bhavadatta
one
ca
help
feeling
that
life
becomes
a
burden
in
this
country
one
misses
the
joys
of
privacy
in
these
streets
this
jostling
and
brushing
shoulders
with
strange
people
day
and
night
makes
one
long
for
a
bath
and
nobody
can
tell
exactly
what
kind
of
people
you
are
meeting
with
in
these
public
roads
ugh
kaundilya
and
it
is
janardan
who
persuaded
us
to
come
to
this
precious
country
we
never
had
any
second
person
like
him
in
our
family
you
knew
my
father
of
course
he
was
a
great
man
a
pious
man
if
ever
there
was
one
he
spent
his
whole
life
within
a
circle
of
a
radius
of
cubits
drawn
with
a
rigid
adherence
to
the
injunctions
of
the
scriptures
and
never
for
a
single
day
did
he
cross
this
circle
after
his
death
a
serious
difficulty
arose
how
cremate
him
within
the
limits
of
the
cubits
and
yet
outside
the
house
at
length
the
priests
decided
that
though
we
could
not
go
beyond
the
scriptural
number
the
only
way
out
of
the
difficulty
was
to
reverse
the
figure
and
make
it
cubits
only
thus
could
we
cremate
him
outside
the
house
without
violating
the
sacred
books
my
word
that
was
strict
observance
ours
is
indeed
no
common
country
bhavadatta
and
yet
though
janardan
comes
from
the
very
same
soil
he
thinks
it
wise
to
declare
that
open
highways
are
best
for
a
country
enter
grandfather
with
a
band
of
boys
grandfather
boys
we
will
have
to
vie
with
the
wild
breeze
of
the
south
and
we
are
not
going
to
be
beaten
we
will
sing
till
we
have
flooded
all
streets
with
our
mirth
and
song
song
the
southern
gate
is
unbarred
come
my
spring
come
thou
wilt
swing
at
the
swing
of
my
heart
come
my
spring
come
come
in
the
lisping
leaves
in
the
youthful
surrender
of
flowers
come
in
the
flute
songs
and
the
wistful
sighs
of
the
woodlands
let
your
unfastened
robe
wildly
flap
in
the
drunken
wind
come
my
spring
come
exeunt
enter
a
band
of
citizens
first
citizen
after
all
one
can
not
help
wishing
that
the
king
had
allowed
himself
to
be
seen
at
least
this
one
day
what
a
great
pity
to
live
in
his
kingdom
and
yet
not
to
have
seen
him
for
a
single
day
second
citizen
if
you
only
knew
the
real
meaning
of
all
this
mystery
i
could
tell
you
if
you
would
keep
a
secret
first
citizen
my
dear
fellow
we
both
live
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
town
but
have
you
ever
known
me
letting
out
any
man
s
secret
of
course
that
matter
of
your
brother
finding
a
hidden
fortune
while
digging
for
a
well
well
you
know
well
enough
why
i
had
to
give
it
out
you
know
all
the
facts
second
citizen
of
course
i
know
and
it
is
because
i
know
that
i
ask
could
you
keep
a
secret
if
i
tell
you
it
may
mean
ruination
to
us
all
you
know
if
you
once
let
it
out
third
citizen
you
are
a
nice
man
after
all
virupaksha
why
are
you
so
anxious
to
bring
down
a
disaster
which
as
yet
only
may
happen
who
will
be
responsible
for
keeping
your
secret
all
his
life
virupaksha
it
is
only
because
the
topic
came
up
well
then
i
shall
not
say
anything
i
am
not
the
man
to
say
things
for
nothing
you
had
yourself
brought
up
the
question
that
the
king
never
showed
himself
and
i
only
remarked
that
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
the
king
shut
himself
up
from
the
public
gaze
first
citizen
pray
do
tell
us
why
virupaksha
virupaksha
of
course
i
do
mind
telling
you
for
we
are
all
good
friends
are
we
there
can
be
no
harm
with
a
low
voice
the
king
is
hideous
to
look
at
so
he
has
made
up
his
mind
never
to
show
himself
to
his
subjects
first
citizen
ha
that
it
it
must
be
so
we
have
always
wondered
why
the
mere
sight
of
a
king
in
all
countries
makes
one
soul
quake
like
an
aspen
leaf
with
fear
but
why
should
our
king
never
have
been
seen
by
any
mortal
soul
even
if
he
at
least
came
out
and
consigned
us
all
to
the
gibbet
we
might
be
sure
that
our
king
was
no
hoax
after
all
there
is
much
in
virupaksha
explanation
that
sounds
plausible
enough
third
citizen
not
a
bit
i
do
believe
in
a
syllable
of
it
virupaksha
what
vishu
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
am
a
liar
vishu
i
do
exactly
mean
that
but
i
can
not
accept
your
theory
excuse
me
i
can
not
help
if
i
seem
a
bit
rude
or
churlish
virupaksha
small
wonder
that
you
ca
believe
my
words
you
who
think
yourself
sage
enough
to
reject
the
opinions
of
your
parents
and
superiors
how
long
do
you
think
you
could
have
stayed
in
this
country
if
the
king
did
not
remain
in
hiding
you
are
no
better
than
a
flagrant
heretic
vishu
my
dear
pillar
of
orthodoxy
do
you
think
any
other
king
would
have
hesitated
to
cut
off
your
tongue
and
make
it
food
for
dogs
and
you
have
the
face
to
say
that
our
king
is
horrid
to
look
at
virupaksha
look
here
vishu
will
you
curb
your
tongue
vishu
it
would
be
superfluous
to
point
out
whose
tongue
needs
the
curbing
first
citizen
hush
my
dear
friends
this
looks
rather
bad
it
seems
as
if
they
are
resolved
to
put
me
in
danger
as
well
i
am
not
going
to
be
a
party
to
all
exit
enter
a
number
of
men
dragging
in
grandfather
in
boisterous
exuberance
second
citizen
grandpa
something
strikes
me
grandfather
what
is
it
second
citizen
this
year
every
country
has
sent
its
people
to
our
festival
but
every
one
asks
everything
is
nice
and
beautiful
but
where
is
your
king
and
we
do
not
know
what
to
answer
that
is
the
one
big
gap
which
can
not
but
make
itself
felt
to
every
one
in
our
country
grandfather
gap
do
you
say
why
the
whole
country
is
all
filled
and
crammed
and
packed
with
the
king
and
you
call
him
a
gap
why
he
has
made
every
one
of
us
a
crowned
king
sings
we
are
all
kings
in
the
kingdom
of
our
king
were
it
not
so
how
could
we
hope
in
our
heart
to
meet
him
we
do
what
we
like
yet
we
do
what
he
likes
we
are
not
bound
with
the
chain
of
fear
at
the
feet
of
a
owning
king
were
it
not
so
how
could
we
hope
in
our
heart
to
meet
him
our
king
honours
each
one
of
us
thus
honours
his
own
very
self
no
littleness
can
keep
us
shut
up
in
its
walls
of
untruth
for
aye
were
it
not
so
how
could
we
have
hope
in
our
heart
to
meet
him
we
struggle
and
dig
our
own
path
thus
reach
his
path
at
the
end
we
can
never
get
lost
in
the
abyss
of
dark
night
were
it
not
so
how
could
we
hope
in
our
heart
to
meet
him
third
citizen
but
really
i
can
not
stand
the
absurd
things
people
say
about
our
king
simply
because
he
is
not
seen
in
public
first
citizen
just
fancy
any
one
libelling
me
can
be
punished
while
nobody
can
stop
the
mouth
of
any
rascal
who
chooses
to
slander
the
king
grandfather
the
slander
can
not
touch
the
king
with
a
mere
breath
you
can
blow
out
the
flame
which
a
lamp
inherits
from
the
sun
but
if
all
the
world
blow
upon
the
sun
itself
its
effulgence
remains
undimmed
and
unimpaired
as
before
enter
vishvavasu
and
virupaksha
vishu
here
grandfather
look
here
this
man
is
going
about
telling
everybody
that
our
king
does
not
come
out
because
he
is
ugly
grandfather
but
why
does
that
make
you
angry
vishu
his
king
must
be
ugly
because
how
else
could
virupaksha
possess
such
features
in
his
kingdom
he
fashions
his
king
after
the
image
of
himself
he
sees
in
the
mirror
virupaksha
grandfather
i
shall
mention
no
names
but
nobody
would
think
of
disbelieving
the
person
who
gave
me
the
news
grandfather
who
could
be
a
higher
authority
than
yourself
virupaksha
but
i
could
give
you
proofs
first
citizen
the
impudence
of
this
fellow
knows
no
bounds
not
content
with
spreading
a
ghastly
rumour
with
an
unabashed
face
he
offers
to
measure
his
lies
with
insolence
second
citizen
why
not
make
him
measure
his
length
on
the
ground
grandfather
why
so
much
heat
my
friends
the
poor
fellow
is
going
to
have
his
own
festive
day
by
singing
the
ugliness
of
his
king
go
along
virupaksha
you
will
find
plenty
of
people
ready
to
believe
you
may
you
be
happy
in
their
exeunt
the
party
of
foreigners
bhavadatta
it
strikes
me
kaundilya
that
these
people
got
a
king
at
all
they
have
somehow
managed
to
keep
the
rumour
afloat
kaundilya
you
are
right
i
think
we
all
know
that
the
supreme
thing
that
strikes
one
eye
in
any
country
is
the
king
who
of
course
loses
no
opportunity
of
exhibiting
himself
janardan
but
look
at
the
nice
order
and
regularity
prevailing
all
over
the
place
how
do
you
explain
it
without
a
king
bhavadatta
so
this
is
the
wisdom
you
have
arrived
at
by
living
so
long
under
a
ruler
where
would
be
the
necessity
of
having
a
king
if
order
and
harmony
existed
already
janardan
all
these
people
have
assembled
to
rejoice
at
this
festival
do
you
think
they
could
come
together
like
this
in
a
country
of
anarchy
bhavadatta
my
dear
janardan
you
are
evading
the
real
issue
as
usual
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
order
and
regularity
and
the
festive
rejoicing
too
is
plain
enough
there
is
no
difficulty
so
far
but
where
is
the
king
have
you
seen
him
just
tell
us
that
janardan
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
you
know
from
your
experience
that
there
can
be
chaos
and
anarchy
even
if
a
king
be
present
but
what
do
we
see
here
kaundilya
you
are
always
coming
back
to
your
quibbling
why
can
you
not
give
a
straight
answer
to
bhavadatta
question
have
you
or
have
you
not
seen
the
king
yes
or
no
exeunt
enter
a
band
of
men
singing
song
my
beloved
is
ever
in
my
heart
that
is
why
i
see
him
everywhere
he
is
in
the
pupils
of
my
eyes
that
is
why
i
see
him
everywhere
i
went
far
away
to
hear
his
own
words
but
ah
it
was
vain
when
i
came
back
i
heard
them
in
my
own
songs
who
are
you
who
seek
him
like
a
beggar
from
door
to
door
come
to
my
heart
and
see
his
face
in
the
tears
of
my
eyes
enter
heralds
and
advance
guards
of
the
king
first
herald
stand
off
get
away
from
the
street
all
of
you
first
citizen
eh
man
who
do
you
think
you
are
you
of
course
born
with
such
lofty
strides
my
friend
why
should
we
stand
off
my
dear
sir
why
should
we
budge
are
we
street
dogs
or
what
second
herald
our
king
is
coming
this
way
second
citizen
king
which
king
first
herald
our
king
the
king
of
this
country
first
citizen
what
is
the
fellow
mad
whoever
heard
of
our
king
coming
out
heralded
by
these
vociferous
gentry
second
herald
the
king
will
no
longer
deny
himself
to
his
subjects
he
is
coming
to
command
the
festivities
himself
second
citizen
brother
is
that
so
second
herald
look
his
banner
is
flying
over
there
second
citizen
ah
yes
that
is
a
flag
indeed
second
herald
do
you
see
the
red
i
kimshuk
flower
painted
on
it
second
citizen
yes
yes
it
is
the
i
kimshuk
indeed
what
a
bright
scarlet
flower
first
herald
well
do
you
believe
us
now
second
citizen
i
never
said
i
did
that
fellow
kumbha
started
all
this
fuss
did
i
say
a
word
first
herald
perhaps
though
a
man
he
is
quite
empty
inside
an
empty
vessel
sounds
most
you
know
second
herald
who
is
he
is
he
any
kinsman
of
yours
second
citizen
not
at
all
he
is
just
a
cousin
of
our
village
chief
and
he
does
not
even
live
in
the
same
part
of
our
village
with
us
second
herald
just
so
he
quite
looks
the
seventh
cousin
of
somebody
and
his
understanding
appears
also
to
bear
the
stamp
of
kumbha
alas
my
friends
many
a
bitter
sorrow
has
given
my
poor
mind
a
twist
before
it
has
become
like
this
it
is
only
the
other
day
that
a
king
came
and
paraded
the
streets
with
as
many
titles
in
front
of
him
as
the
drums
that
made
the
town
hideous
by
their
din
what
did
i
not
do
to
serve
and
please
him
i
rained
presents
on
him
i
hung
about
him
like
a
beggar
and
in
the
end
i
found
the
strain
on
my
resources
too
hard
to
bear
but
what
was
the
end
of
all
that
pomp
and
majesty
when
people
sought
grants
and
presents
from
him
he
could
not
somehow
discover
an
auspicious
day
in
the
calendar
though
all
days
were
days
when
we
had
to
pay
our
taxes
second
herald
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
our
king
is
a
bogus
king
like
the
one
you
have
described
first
herald
i
believe
the
time
has
come

poor
creature
my
sincerest
apologies

to
be
excused
i

quite
willing

second
herald
all
right
come
here
and
form
a
line

and
prepare
the
way
for

they
go
out
second
citizen
my
dear
kumbha
your
tongue
will
be
your
death
one
day
kumbha
friend
madhav
it
is
my
tongue
it
is
fate
when
the
bogus
king
appeared
i
never
said
a
word
though
that
did
not
prevent
my
striking
at
my
own
feet
with
all
the
of
innocence
and
now
when
perhaps
the
real
king
has
come
i
simply
must
blurt
out
treason
it
is
fate
my
dear
friend
madhav
my
faith
is
to
go
on
obeying
the
king
it
does
not
matter
whether
he
is
a
real
one
or
a
pretender
what
do
we
know
of
kings
that
we
should
judge
them
it
is
like
throwing
stones
in
the
dark
you
are
almost
sure
of
hitting
your
mark
i
go
on
obeying
and
acknowledging
if
it
is
a
real
king
well
and
good
if
not
what
harm
is
there
kumbha
i
should
not
have
minded
if
the
stones
were
nothing
better
than
stones
but
they
are
often
precious
things
here
as
elsewhere
extravagance
lands
us
in
poverty
my
friend
madhav
look
there
comes
the
king
ah
a
king
indeed
what
a
figure
what
a
face
whoever
saw
such
beauty
what
now
kumbha
what
do
you
think
now
kumbha
he
looks
all
right
yes
he
may
be
the
real
king
for
all
i
know
madhav
he
looks
as
if
he
were
moulded
and
carved
for
kingship
a
figure
too
exquisite
and
delicate
for
the
common
light
of
day

i
came
here
at
the
first
report
of
thy
coming
i
did
not
stop
to
hear
what
people
were
saying
all
the
loyalty
in
me
went
out
towards
thee
o
monarch
and
brought
me
here
third
man
rubbish
i
came
here
earlier
than
you
before
the
cockcrow
where
were
you

o
king
i

bhadrasena
of
vikramasthali
deign

keep

servant
in
thy

am
much

devotion

your
majesty
many
are
the
grievances
and
complaints
we
have
to
make
to
thee
to
whom
could
we
turn

prayers
so
long
when
we
could
not
approach
thy
august
presence
king

grievances
will
all
be
redressed

first
man
it
wo
do
to
lag
behind
boys
the
king
will
lose
sight
of
us
if
we
get
mixed
up
with
the
mob
second
man
see
what
that
fool
narottam
is
doing
he
has
elbowed
his
way
through
all
of
us
and
is
now
sedulously
fanning
the
king
with
a
palm
leaf
madhav
indeed
well
well
the
sheer
audacity
of
the
man
takes
one
breath
away
second
man
we
shall
have
to
pitch
the
fellow
out
of
that
place
is
he
fit
to
stand
beside
the
king
madhav
do
you
imagine
the
king
will
not
see
through
him
his
loyalty
is
obviously
a
little
too
showy
and
profuse
first
man
nonsense
kings
ca
scent
hypocrites
as
we
do
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
the
king
be
taken
in
by
that
strenuous
fanning
enter
kumbha
with
grandfather
kumbha
i
tell
you
he
has
just
passed
by
this
street
grandfather
is
that
a
very
infallible
test
of
kingship
kumbha
oh
no
he
did
not
pass
unobserved
not
one
or
two
men
but
hundreds
and
thousands
on
both
sides
of
the
street
have
seen
him
with
their
own
eyes
grandfather
that
is
exactly
what
makes
the
whole
affair
suspicious
when
ever
has
our
king
set
out
to
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
people
by
pomp
and
pageantry
he
is
not
the
king
to
make
such
a
thundering
row
over
his
progress
through
the
country
kumbha
but
he
may
just
have
chosen
to
do
so
on
this
important
occasion
you
can
not
really
tell
grandfather
oh
yes
you
can
my
king
cherishes
no
weathercock
fancy
no
fantastic
vein
kumbha
but
grandfather
i
wish
i
could
only
describe
him
so
soft
so
delicate
and
exquisite
like
a
waxen
doll
as
i
looked
on
him
i
yearned
to
shelter
him
from
the
sun
to
protect
him
with
my
whole
body
grandfather
fool
o
precious
ass
that
you
are
i
my
king
a
waxen
doll
and
you
to
protect
him
kumbha
but
seriously
grandpa
he
is
a
superb
god
a
miracle
of
beauty
i
do
not
find
a
single
other
figure
in
this
vast
assembly
that
can
stand
beside
his
peerless
loveliness
grandfather
if
my
king
chose
to
make
himself
shown
your
eyes
would
not
have
noticed
him
he
would
not
stand
out
like
that
amongst
others
he
is
one
of
the
people
he
mingles
with
the
common
populace
kumbha
but
did
i
not
tell
you
i
saw
his
banner
grandfather
what
did
you
see
displayed
on
his
banner
kumbha
it
had
a
red
i
kimshuk
flower
painted
on
it
the
bright
and
glittering
scarlet
dazzled
my
eyes
grandfather
i
my
king
has
a
thunderbolt
within
a
lotus
painted
on
his
flag
kumbha
but
every
one
is
saying
the
king
is
out
in
this
festival
i
every
one
grandfather
why
so
he
is
of
course
but
he
has
no
heralds
no
army
no
retinue
no
music
bands
or
lights
to
accompany
him
kumbha
so
none
could
recognise
him
in
his
incognito
it
seems
grandfather
perhaps
there
are
a
few
that
can
kumbha
and
those
that
can
recognise
him
does
the
king
grant
them
whatever
they
ask
for
grandfather
but
they
never
ask
for
anything
no
beggar
will
ever
know
the
king
the
greater
beggar
appears
like
the
king
to
the
eyes
of
the
lesser
beggar
o
fool
the
man
that
has
come
out
attired
in
crimson
and
gold
to
beg
from
you
it
is
him
whom
you
are
trumpeting
as
your
king
ah
there
comes
my
mad
friend
oh
come
my
brothers
we
can
not
spend
the
day
in
idle
wrangling
and
prating
let
us
now
have
some
mad
frolic
some
wild
enjoyment
enter
the
mad
friend
who
sings
do
you
smile
my
friends
do
you
laugh
my
brothers
i
roam
in
search
of
the
golden
stag
ah
yes
the
vision
that
ever
eludes
me
oh
he
flits
and
glimpses
like
a
flash
and
then
is
gone
the
untamed
rover
of
the
wilds
approach
him
and
he
is
afar
in
a
trice
leaving
a
cloud
of
haze
and
dust
before
thy
eyes
yet
i
roam
in
search
of
the
golden
stag
though
i
may
never
catch
him
in
these
wilds
oh
i
roam
and
wander
through
woods
and
fields
and
nameless
lands
like
a
restless
vagabond
never
caring
to
turn
my
back
you
all
come
and
buy
in
the
marketplace
and
go
back
to
your
homes
laden
with
goods
and
provisions
but
me
the
wild
winds
of
unscalable
heights
have
touched
and
kissed
oh
i
know
not
when
or
where
i
have
parted
with
my
all
to
get
what
never
has
become
mine
and
yet
think
my
moanings
and
my
tears
are
for
the
things
i
thus
have
lost
with
a
laugh
and
a
song
in
my
heart
i
have
left
all
sorrow
and
grief
far
behind
me
oh
i
roam
and
wander
through
woods
and
fields
and
nameless
lands
never
caring
to
turn
my
back
ii
a
darkchamber
queen
sudarshana
her
maid
of
honour
surangama
sudarshana
light
light
where
is
light
will
the
lamp
never
be
lighted
in
this
chamber
surangama
my
queen
all
your
other
rooms
are
lighted
will
you
never
long
to
escape
from
the
light
into
a
dark
room
like
this
sudarshana
but
why
should
this
room
be
kept
dark
surangama
because
otherwise
you
would
know
neither
light
nor
darkness
sudarshana
living
in
this
dark
room
you
have
grown
to
speak
darkly
and
strangely
i
can
not
understand
you
surangama
but
tell
me
in
what
part
of
the
palace
is
this
chamber
situated
i
can
not
make
out
either
the
entrance
or
the
way
out
of
this
room
surangama
this
room
is
placed
deep
down
in
the
very
heart
of
the
earth
the
king
has
built
this
room
specially
for
your
sake
sudarshana
why
he
has
no
dearth
of
rooms
why
need
he
have
made
this
chamber
of
darkness
specially
for
me
surangama
you
can
meet
others
in
the
lighted
rooms
but
only
in
this
dark
room
can
you
meet
your
lord
sudarshana
no
no
i
can
not
live
without
light
i
am
restless
in
this
stifling
dark
surangama
if
you
can
bring
a
light
into
this
room
i
shall
give
you
this
necklace
of
mine
surangama
it
is
not
in
my
power
o
queen
how
can
i
bring
light
to
a
place
which
he
would
have
kept
always
dark
sudarshana
strange
devotion
and
yet
is
it
not
true
that
the
king
punished
your
father
surangama
yes
that
is
true
my
father
used
to
gamble
all
the
young
men
of
the
country
used
to
gather
at
my
they
used
to
drink
and
gamble
sudarshana
and
when
the
king
sent
away
your
father
in
exile
did
it
not
make
you
feel
bitterly
oppressed
surangama
oh
it
made
me
quite
furious
i
was
on
the
road
to
ruin
and
destruction
when
that
path
was
closed
for
me
i
seemed
left
without
any
support
without
any
succour
or
shelter
i
raged
and
raved
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
cage
how
i
wanted
to
tear
every
one
to
pieces
in
my
powerless
anger
sudarshana
but
how
did
you
get
this
devotion
towards
that
same
king
surangama
how
can
i
tell
perhaps
i
could
rely
and
depend
on
him
because
he
was
so
hard
so
pitiless
sudarshana
when
did
this
change
of
feeling
take
place
surangama
i
could
not
tell
you
i
do
not
know
that
myself
a
day
came
when
all
the
rebel
in
me
knew
itself
beaten
and
then
my
whole
nature
bowed
down
in
humble
resignation
on
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
then
i
saw
i
saw
that
he
was
as
matchless
in
beauty
as
in
terror
oh
i
was
saved
i
was
rescued
sudarshana
tell
me
surangama
i
implore
you
wo
you
tell
me
what
is
the
king
like
to
look
at
i
have
not
seen
him
yet
for
a
single
day
he
comes
to
me
in
darkness
and
leaves
me
in
this
dark
room
again
how
many
people
have
i
not
asked
but
they
all
return
vague
and
dark
answers
it
seems
to
me
that
they
all
keep
back
something
surangama
to
tell
you
the
truth
queen
i
could
not
say
well
what
he
is
like
no
he
is
not
what
men
call
handsome
sudarshana
you
do
say
so
not
handsome
surangama
no
my
queen
he
is
not
handsome
to
call
him
beautiful
would
be
to
say
far
too
little
about
him
sudarshana
all
your
words
are
like
that
dark
strange
and
vague
i
can
not
understand
what
you
mean
surangama
no
i
will
not
call
him
handsome
and
it
is
because
he
is
not
beautiful
that
he
is
so
wonderful
so
superb
so
miraculous
sudarshana
i
do
not
quite
understand
you
though
i
like
to
hear
you
talk
about
him
but
i
must
see
him
at
any
cost
i
do
not
even
remember
the
day
when
i
was
married
to
him
i
have
heard
mother
say
that
a
wise
man
came
before
my
marriage
and
said
he
who
will
wed
your
daughter
is
without
a
second
on
this
earth
how
often
have
i
asked
her
to
describe
his
appearance
to
me
but
she
only
answers
vaguely
and
says
she
can
not
say
she
saw
him
through
a
veil
faintly
and
obscurely
but
if
he
is
the
best
among
men
how
can
i
sit
still
without
seeing
him
surangama
do
you
not
feel
a
faint
breeze
blowing
sudarshana
a
breeze
where
surangama
do
you
not
smell
a
soft
perfume
sudarshana
no
i
do
surangama
the
large
door
has
opened
he
is
coming
my
king
is
coming
in
sudarshana
how
can
you
perceive
when
he
comes
surangama
i
can
not
say
i
seem
to
hear
his
footsteps
in
my
own
heart
being
his
servant
of
this
dark
chamber
i
have
developed
a
sense
i
can
know
and
feel
without
seeing
sudarshana
would
that
i
had
this
sense
too
surangama
surangama
you
will
have
it
o
queen
this
sense
will
awaken
in
you
one
day
your
longing
to
have
a
sight
of
him
makes
you
restless
and
therefore
all
your
mind
is
strained
and
warped
in
that
direction
when
you
are
past
this
state
of
feverish
restlessness
everything
will
become
quite
easy
sudarshana
how
is
it
that
it
is
easy
to
you
who
are
a
servant
and
so
difficult
to
me
the
queen
surangama
it
is
because
i
am
a
mere
servant
that
no
difficulty
baulks
me
on
the
first
day
when
he
left
this
room
to
my
care
saying
surangama
you
will
always
keep
this
chamber
ready
for
me
this
is
all
your
task
then
i
did
not
say
even
in
thought
oh
give
me
the
work
of
those
who
keep
the
other
rooms
lighted
no
but
as
soon
as
i
bent
all
my
mind
to
my
task
a
power
woke
and
grew
within
me
and
mastered
every
part
of
me
unopposed
oh
there
he
comes
he
is
standing
outside
before
the
door
lord
o
king
song
outside

your
door

am
waiting

the
dawn
to
the
dark

done
for
the
day
the
evening
star
is
up
have
you
gathered
your
flowers
braided
your
hair
and
donned
your
white
robe
for
the
night
the
cattle
have
come
to
their
folds
and
birds
to
their
nests
the
cross
paths
that
run
to
all
quarters
have
merged
into
one
in
the
dark
open
your
door
i
am
waiting
surangama
o
king
who
can
keep
thy
own
doors
shut
against
thee
they
are
not
locked
or
bolted
they
will
swing
wide
open
if
you
only
touch
them
with
thy
fingers
wilt
thou
not
even
touch
them
wilt
thou
not
enter
unless
i
go
and
open
the
doors
song
at
a
breath
you
can
remove
my
veils
my
lord
if
i
fall
asleep
on
the
dust
and
hear
not
your
call
would
you
wait
till
i
wake
would
not
the
thunder
of
your
chariot
wheel
make
the
earth
tremble
would
you
not
burst
open
the
door
and
enter
your
own
house
unbidden
then
do
you
go
o
queen
and
open
the
door
for
him
he
will
not
enter
otherwise
sudarshana
i
do
not
see
anything
distinctly
in
the
dark
i
do
not
know
where
the
doors
are
you
know
everything
here
go
and
open
the
doors
for
me
surangama
opens
the
door
bows
to
the
king
and
goes
out
the
king
will
remain
invisible
throughout
this
play
sudarshana
why
do
you
not
allow
me
to
see
you
in
the
light
king
so
you
want
to
see
me
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
things
in
broad
daylight
why
should
i
not
be
the
only
thing
you
can
feel
in
this
darkness
sudarshana
but
i
must
see
you
i
am
longing
to
have
a
sight
of
you
king
you
will
not
be
able
to
bear
the
sight
of
me
it
will
only
give
you
pain
poignant
and
overpowering
sudarshana
how
can
you
say
that
i
shall
be
unable
to
bear
your
sight
oh
i
can
feel
even
in
this
dark
how
lovely
and
wonderful
you
are
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
you
in
the
light
but
tell
me
can
you
see
me
in
the
dark
king
yes
i
can
sudarshana
what
do
you
see
king
i
see
that
the
darkness
of
the
infinite
heavens
whirled
into
life
and
being
by
the
power
of
my
love
has
drawn
the
light
of
a
myriad
stars
into
itself
and
incarnated
itself
in
a
form
of
flesh
and
blood
and
in
that
form
what
aeons
of
thought
and
striving
untold
yearnings
of
limitless
skies
the
countless
gifts
of
unnumbered
seasons
sudarshana
am
i
so
wonderful
so
beautiful
when
i
hear
you
speak
so
my
heart
swells
with
gladness
and
pride
but
how
can
i
believe
the
wonderful
things
you
tell
me
i
can
not
find
them
in
myself
king
your
own
mirror
will
not
reflect
them
it
lessens
you
limits
you
makes
you
look
small
and
insignificant
but
could
you
see
yourself
mirrored
in
my
own
mind
how
grand
would
you
appear
in
my
own
heart
you
are
no
longer
the
daily
individual
which
you
think
you
are
you
are
verily
my
second
self
sudarshana
oh
do
show
me
for
an
instant
how
to
see
with
your
eyes
is
there
nothing
at
all
like
darkness
to
you
i
am
afraid
when
i
think
of
this
this
darkness
which
is
to
me
real
and
strong
as
death
is
this
simply
nothing
to
you
then
how
can
there
be
any
union
at
all
between
us
in
a
place
like
this
no
no
it
is
impossible
there
is
a
barrier
betwixt
us
two
not
here
no
not
in
this
place
i
want
to
find
you
and
see
you
where
i
see
trees
and
animals
birds
and
stones
and
the
earth
king
very
well
you
can
try
to
find
me
but
none
will
point
me
out
to
you
you
will
have
to
recognise
me
if
you
can
yourself
and
even
if
anybody
professes
to
show
me
to
you
how
can
you
be
sure
he
is
speaking
the
truth
sudarshana
i
shall
know
you
i
shall
recognise
you
i
shall
find
you
out
among
a
million
men
i
can
not
be
mistaken
king
very
well
then
during
the
festival
of
the
full
moon
of
the
spring
you
will
try
to
find
me
out
from
the
high
turret
of
my
palace
search
for
me
with
your
own
eyes
amongst
the
crowd
of
people
sudarshana
wilt
thou
be
there
among
them
king
i
shall
show
myself
again
and
again
from
every
side
of
the
crowd
surangama
enter
surangama
surangama
what
is
thy
pleasure
lord
king
is
the
full
moon
festival
of
the
spring
surangama
what
have
i
to
do
king
is
a
festive
day
not
a
day
of
work
the
pleasure
gardens
are
in
their
full
bloom
you
will
join
in
my
festivities
there
surangama
i
shall
do
as
thou
desirest
lord
king
the
queen
wants
to
see
me
with
her
own
eyes
surangama
where
will
the
queen
see
you
king
where
the
music
will
play
at
its
sweetest
where
the
air
will
be
heavy
with
the
dust
of
flowers
there
in
the
pleasure
grove
of
silver
light
and
mellow
gloom
surangama
what
can
be
seen
in
the
of
darkness
and
light
there
the
wind
is
wild
and
restless
everything
is
dance
and
swift
movement
will
it
not
puzzle
the
eyes
king
the
queen
is
curious
to
search
me
out
surangama
curiosity
will
have
to
come
back
baffled
and
in
tears
song
ah
they
would
fly
away
the
restless
vagrant
eyes
the
wild
birds
of
the
forest
but
the
time
of
their
surrender
will
come
their
flights
hither
and
thither
will
be
ended
when
the
music
of
enchantment
will
pursue
them
and
pierce
their
hearts
alas
the
wild
birds
would
fly
to
the
wilderness
iii
before
the
pleasure
gardens
enter
avanti
koshala
kanchi
and
other
kings
avanti
will
the
king
of
this
place
not
receive
us
kanchi
what
manner
of
governing
a
country
is
this
the
king
is
having
a
festival
in
a
forest
where
even
the
meanest
and
commonest
people
can
have
easy
access
koshala
we
ought
to
have
had
a
separate
place
set
apart
and
ready
for
our
reception
kanchi
if
he
has
not
prepared
such
a
place
yet
we
shall
compel
him
to
have
one
erected
for
us
koshala
all
this
makes
one
naturally
suspect
if
these
people
have
really
got
any
king
at
all
it
looks
as
if
an
unfounded
rumour
has
led
us
astray
avanti
it
may
be
so
with
regard
to
the
king
but
the
queen
sudarshana
of
this
place
is
at
all
an
unfounded
rumour
koshala
it
is
only
for
her
sake
that
i
have
cared
to
come
at
all
i
do
mind
omitting
to
see
one
who
never
makes
himself
visible
but
it
would
be
a
stupid
mistake
if
we
were
to
go
away
without
a
sight
of
one
who
is
eminently
worth
a
visit
kanchi
let
us
make
some
definite
plan
then
avanti
a
plan
is
an
excellent
thing
so
long
as
you
are
not
yourself
entangled
in
it
kanchi
hang
it
who
are
these
vermin
swarming
this
way
here
who
are
you
enter
grandfather
and
the
boys
grandfather
we
are
the
jolly
band
of
avanti
the
introduction
was
superfluous
but
you
will
take
yourselves
away
a
little
further
and
leave
us
in
peace
grandfather
we
never
suffer
from
a
want
of
space
we
can
afford
to
give
you
as
wide
a
berth
as
you
like
what
little
suffices
for
us
is
never
the
bone
of
contention
between
any
rival
claimants
is
not
that
so
my
little
friends
they
sing
song
we
have
nothing
indeed
we
have
nothing
at
all
we
sing
merrily
fol
de

some

high
walls
of
their
houses
on
the
bog
of
the
sands
of
gold
we
stand
before
them
and
sing
fol
de
rol
de

pickpockets
hover
about
us
and
honour
us
with
covetous
glances
we
shake
our
empty
pockets
and
sing
fol
de

de

when
death
the
old
hag
steals
to
our
doors
we
snap
our
fingers
at
her
face
and
we
sing
in
a
chorus
with
gay
flourishes
fol
de
rol
de

kanchi
look
over
there
koshala
who
are
those
coming
this
way
a
pantomime
somebody
is
out
masquerading
as
a
king
koshala
the
king
of
this
place
may
tolerate
all
this
tomfoolery
but
we
wo
avanti
he
is
perhaps
some
rural
chief
enter
guards
on
foot
kanchi
what
country
does
your
king
come
from
first
soldier
he
is
the
king
of
this
country
he
is
going
to
command
the
festivities
they
go
out
koshala
what
the
king
of
this
country
come
out
for
the
festivities
avanti
indeed
we
shall
then
have
to
return
with
a
sight
of
him
only
leaving
the
delectable
queen
unseen
kanchi
do
you
really
think
that
fellow
spoke
the
truth
anybody
can
pass
himself
off
as
the
king
of
this
kingless
country
can
you
not
see
that
the
man
looks
like
a
king
much
too
avanti
but
he
looks
handsome
his
appearance
is
not
without
a
certain
pleasing
attractiveness
kanchi
he
may
be
pleasing
to
your
eye
but
if
you
look
at
him
closely
enough
there
can
be
no
mistaking
him
you
will
see
how
i
expose
him
before
you
all
enter
the
king
king
welcome
princes
to
our
kingdom
i
trust
your
reception
has
been
properly
looked
after
by
my
officials
kings
with
feigned
courtesy
oh
yes
nothing
was
lacking
in
the
reception
kanchi
if
there
was
any
shortcoming
at
all
it
has
been
made
up
by
the
honour
of
our
sight
of
your
majesty
king
we
do
not
show
ourselves
to
the
general
public
but
your
great
devotion
and
loyalty
to
us
has
made
it
a
pleasure
for
us
not
to
deny
ourselves
to
you
kanchi
it
is
truly
hard
for
us
your
majesty
to
bear
the
weight
of
your
gracious
favours
king
we
are
afraid
we
shall
not
be
able
to
stop
here
long
kanchi
i
have
thought
so
already
you
do
not
quite
look
up
to
it
king
in
the
meantime
if
you
have
any
favours
to
ask
of
us
kanchi
we
have
but
we
would
like
to
speak
a
little
more
in
private
king
to
his
attendants
retire
a
little
from
our
presence
they
retire
now
you
can
express
your
desires
without
any
reserve
kanchi
there
will
be
no
reserve
on
our
part
our
only
fear
is
that
you
might
think
restraint
necessary
for
yourself
king
oh
no
you
need
have
no
scruples
on
that
score
kanchi
come
then
do
us
homage
by
placing
your
head
on
the
ground
before
us
king
it
seems
my
servants
have
distributed
the
varuni
spirits
too
liberally
in
the
reception
camps
kanchi
false
pretender
it
is
you
who
are
suffering
from
an
overdose
of
arrogant
spirits
your
head
will
soon
kiss
the
dust
king
princes
these
heavy
jokes
are
not
worthy
of
a
king
kanchi
those
who
will
jest
properly
with
you
are
near
at
hand
general
king
no
more
i
entreat
you
i
can
see
plainly
i
owe
homage
to
you
all
the
head
is
bowing
down
of
itself
there
is
no
need
for
the
application
of
any
sharp
methods
to
lay
it
low
so
here
i
do
my
obeisance
to
you
all
if
you
kindly
allow
me
to
escape
i
shall
not
inflict
my
presence
long
on
you
kanchi
why
should
you
escape
we
will
make
you
king
of
this
place
let
us
carry
our
joke
to
its
legitimate
finish
have
you
got
any
following
king
i
have
every
one
who
sees
me
in
the
streets
flocks
after
me
when
i
had
a
meagre
retinue
at
first
every
one
regarded
me
with
suspicion
but
now
with
the
increasing
crowd
their
doubts
are
waning
and
dissolving
the
crowd
is
being
hypnotised
by
its
own
magnitude
i
have
not
got
to
do
anything
now
kanchi
that
excellent
from
this
moment
we
all
promise
to
help
and
stand
by
you
but
you
will
have
to
do
us
one
service
in
return
king
your
commands
and
the
crown
you
are
putting
on
my
head
will
be
equally
binding
and
sacred
to
me
kanchi
at
present
we
want
nothing
more
than
a
sight
of
the
queen
sudarshana
you
will
have
to
see
to
this
king
i
shall
spare
no
pains
for
that
kanchi
we
can
not
put
much
faith
on
your
pains
you
will
be
solely
directed
by
our
instructions
but
now
you
can
go
and
join
the
festivities
in
the
royal
arbour
with
all
possible
splendour
and
magnificence
they
go
out
enter
grandfather
and
a
band
of
people
first
citizen
grandfather
i
can
not
help
saying
yes
and
repeating
it
five
hundred
times
that
our
king
is
a
perfect
fraud
grandfather
why
only
five
hundred
times
there
is
no
need
to
practise
such
heroic
you
can
say
it
five
thousand
times
if
that
adds
to
your
pleasure
second
citizen
but
you
can
not
keep
up
a
dead
lie
forever
grandfather
it
has
made
me
alive
my
friend
third
citizen
we
shall
proclaim
to
the
whole
world
that
our
king
is
a
lie
the
merest
and
emptiest
shadow
first
citizen
we
shall
all
shout
from
our
housetops
that
we
have
no
king
let
him
do
whatever
he
likes
if
he
exists
grandfather
he
will
do
nothing
at
all
second
citizen
my
son
died
untimely
at
of
raging
fever
in
seven
days
could
such
a
calamity
befall
me
under
the
rule
of
a
virtuous
king
grandfather
but
you
still
have
got
two
sons
left
while
i
have
lost
all
my
five
children
one
after
another
third
citizen
what
do
you
say
now
grandfather
what
then
shall
i
lose
my
king
too
because
i
have
lost
my
children
do
take
me
for
such
a
big
fool
as
that
first
citizen
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
argue
whether
there
is
a
king
or
not
when
one
is
simply
starving
for
want
of
food
will
the
king
save
us
grandfather
brother
you
are
right
but
why
not
i
find
the
king
who
owns
all
the
food
you
certainly
will
not
find
by
your
wailings
at
home
second
citizen
look
at
the
justice
of
our
king
that
bhadrasen
you
know
what
a
touching
sight
he
is
when
he
is
speaking
of
his
king
the
sentimental
idiot
he
is
reduced
to
such
a
state
of
penury
that
even
the
bats
that
infest
his
house
find
it
a
too
uncomfortable
place
grandfather
why
look
at
me
i
am
toiling
and
slaving
night
and
day
for
my
king
but
i
have
not
yet
received
so
much
as
a
brass
farthing
for
my
pains
third
citizen
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
grandfather
what
should
i
think
does
any
one
reward
his
friends
go
my
friends
and
say
if
you
like
that
our
king
exists
nowhere
that
is
also
a
part
of
our
ceremony
in
celebrating
this
festival
iv
turret
of
the
royal
palace
sudarshana
and
her
friend
rohini
sudarshana
you
may
make
mistakes
rohini
but
i
can
not
be
mistaken
am
i
not
the
queen
that
of
course
must
be
my
king
rohini
he
who
has
conferred
such
high
honour
upon
you
can
not
be
long
in
showing
himself
to
you
sudarshana
his
very
form
makes
me
restless
like
a
caged
bird
did
you
try
well
to
ascertain
who
he
is
rohini
yes
i
did
every
one
i
asked
said
that
he
was
the
king
sudarshana
what
country
is
he
the
king
of
rohini
our
country
king
of
this
land
sudarshana
are
you
sure
that
you
are
speaking
of
him
who
has
a
sunshade
made
of
flowers
held
over
his
head
rohini
the
same
he
whose
flag
has
the
i
kimshuk
flower
painted
on
it
sudarshana
i
recognised
him
at
once
of
course
but
it
is
you
who
had
your
doubts
rohini
we
are
apt
to
make
mistakes
my
queen
and
we
are
afraid
to
offend
you
in
case
we
are
wrong
sudarshana
would
that
surangama
were
here
there
would
remain
no
room
for
doubt
then
rohini
do
you
think
her
cleverer
than
any
of
us
sudarshana
oh
no
but
she
would
recognise
him
instantly
rohini
i
can
not
believe
that
she
would
she
merely
pretends
to
know
him
there
is
none
to
test
her
knowledge
if
she
professes
to
know
the
king
if
we
were
as
shameless
as
she
is
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
for
us
to
boast
about
our
acquaintance
with
the
king
sudarshana
but
no
she
never
boasts
rohini
it
is
pure
affectation
the
whole
of
it
which
often
goes
a
longer
way
than
open
boasting
she
is
up
to
all
manner
of
tricks
that
is
why
we
could
never
like
her
sudarshana
but
whatever
you
may
say
i
should
have
liked
to
ask
her
if
she
were
here
rohini
very
well
queen
i
shall
bring
her
here
she
must
be
lucky
if
she
is
indispensable
for
the
queen
to
know
the
king
sudarshana
oh
no
it
is
for
that
but
i
would
like
to
hear
it
said
by
every
one
rohini
is
not
every
one
saying
it
why
just
listen
the
acclamations
of
the
people
mount
up
even
to
this
height
sudarshana
then
do
one
thing
put
these
flowers
on
a
lotus
leaf
and
take
them
to
him
rohini
and
what
am
i
to
say
if
he
asks
who
sends
them
sudarshana
you
will
not
have
to
say
anything
he
will
know
he
thought
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
recognise
him
i
can
not
let
him
off
without
showing
that
i
have
found
him
out
rohini
goes
out
with
the
flowers
sudarshana
my
heart
is
all
and
restless
i
have
never
felt
like
this
before
the
white
silver
light
of
the
full
moon
is
flooding
the
heavens
and
brimming
over
on
every
side
like
the
bubbling
foam
of
wine
it
seizes
on
me
like
a
yearning
like
a
mantling
intoxication
here
who
is
here
enter
a
servant
servant
what
is
your
pleasure
your
majesty
sudarshana
do
you
see
those
festive
boys
singing
and
moving
through
the
alleys
and
avenues
of
the
mango
trees
call
them
hither
bring
them
to
me
i
want
to
hear
them
sing
servant
goes
out
and
enters
with
the
boys
come
living
emblems
of
youthful
spring
begin
your
festive
song
all
my
mind
and
body
is
song
and
music
but
the
ineffable
melody
escapes
my
tongue
do
you
then
sing
for
my
sake
song
my
sorrow
is
sweet
to
me
in
this
spring
night
my
pain
smites
at
the
chords
of
my
love
and
softly
sings
visions
take
birth
from
my
yearning
eyes
and
flit
in
the
moonlit
sky
the
smells
from
the
depths
of
the
woodlands
have
lost
their
way
in
my
dreams
words
come
in
whispers
to
my
ears
i
know
not
from
where
and
bells
in
my
anklets
tremble
and
jingle
in
time
with
my
heart
thrills
sudarshana
enough
enough
i
can
not
bear
it
any
more
your
song
has
filled
my
eyes
with
tears
a
fancy
comes
to
me
that
desire
can
never
attain
its
object
it
need
never
attain
it
what
sweet
hermit
of
the
woods
has
taught
you
this
song
oh
that
my
eyes
could
see
him
whose
song
my
ears
have
heard
oh
how
i
wish
i
wish
i
could
wander
rapt
and
lovely
in
the
thick
woodland
arbours
of
the
heart
dear
boys
of
the
hermitage
how
shall
i
reward
you
this
necklace
is
but
made
of
jewels
hard
stones
its
hardness
will
give
you
pain
i
have
got
nothing
like
the
garlands
of
flowers
you
have
on
the
boys
bow
and
go
out
enter
rohini
sudarshana
i
have
not
done
well
i
have
not
done
well
rohini
i
feel
ashamed
to
ask
you
what
happened
i
have
just
realised
that
no
hand
can
really
give
the
greatest
of
gifts
still
let
me
hear
all
rohini
when
i
gave
the
king
those
flowers
he
did
not
appear
to
understand
anything
sudarshana
you
do
say
so
he
did
not
understand
rohini
no
he
sat
there
like
a
doll
without
uttering
a
single
word
i
think
he
did
not
want
to
show
that
he
understood
nothing
so
he
just
held
his
tongue
sudarshana
fie
on
me
my
shamelessness
has
been
justly
punished
why
did
you
not
bring
back
my
flowers
rohini
how
could
i
the
king
of
kanchi
a
very
clever
man
who
was
sitting
by
him
took
in
everything
at
a
glance
and
he
just
smiled
a
bit
and
said
emperor
the
queen
sudarshana
sends
your
majesty
her
greetings
with
these
blossoms
the
blossoms
that
belong
to
the
god
of
love
the
friend
of
spring
the
king
seemed
to
awake
with
a
start
and
said
this
is
the
crown
of
all
my
regal
glory
i
was
coming
back
all
out
of
countenance
when
the
king
of
kanchi
took
off
this
necklace
of
jewels
from
the
king
person
and
said
to
me
friend
the
king
garland
gives
itself
up
to
you
in
return
for
the
happy
fortune
you
have
brought
sudarshana
what
kanchi
had
to
make
the
king
understand
all
this
woe
is
me
festival
has
opened
wide
for
me
the
doors
of
ignominy
and
shame
what
else
could
i
expect
leave
me
alone
rohini
i
want
solitude
for
a
time
rohini
goes
out
a
great
blow
has
shattered
my
pride
to
atoms
and
yet
i
can
not
efface
from
my
mind
that
beautiful
fascinating
figure
no
pride
is
left
me
i
am
beaten
vanquished
utterly
helpless
i
can
not
even
turn
away
from
him
oh
how
the
wish
comes
back
to
me
again
and
again
to
ask
that
garland
of
rohini
but
what
would
she
think
rohini
enter
rohini
rohini
what
is
your
wish
sudarshana
what
reward
do
you
deserve
for
your
services
rohini
nothing
from
you
but
i
had
my
reward
from
the
king
as
it
should
be
sudarshana
that
is
no
free
gift
but
an
extortion
of
reward
i
do
not
like
to
see
you
put
on
what
was
given
in
so
indifferent
a
manner
take
it
off
i
give
you
my
bracelets
if
you
leave
it
here
take
these
bracelets
and
go
now
rohini
goes
out
another
defeat
i
should
have
thrown
this
necklace
away
but
i
could
not
it
is
pricking
me
as
if
it
were
a
garland
of
thorns
but
i
can
not
throw
it
away
this
is
what
the
god
of
the
festival
has
brought
me
this
necklace
of
ignominy
and
shame
v
grandfather
near
the
door
of
the
pleasure
house
a
company
of
men
grandfather
have
you
had
enough
of
it
friends
first
man
oh
more
than
that
grandpa
just
see
they
have
made
me
red
all
over
none
has
escaped
author
note
during
the
spring
festival
in
india
people
throw
red
powder
on
each
other
in
this
play
this
red
powder
has
been
taken
to
be
the
symbol
of
the
passion
of
love
grandfather
no
did
they
throw
the
red
dust
on
the
kings
too
second
man
but
who
could
approach
them
they
were
all
secure
inside
the
enclosures
grandfather
so
they
have
escaped
you
could
you
not
throw
the
least
bit
of
colour
on
them
you
should
have
forced
your
way
there
third
man
my
dear
old
man
they
have
a
different
sort
of
red
specially
to
themselves
their
eyes
are
red
the
turbans
of
their
guards
and
retinue
are
red
too
and
the
latter
flourished
their
swords
about
so
much
that
a
little
more
nearness
on
our
part
would
have
meant
a
lavish
display
of
the
fundamental
red
colour
grandfather
well
done
friends
always
keep
them
at
a
distance
they
are
the
exiles
of
the
earth
and
we
have
got
to
keep
them
so
third
man
i
am
going
home
grandpa
it
is
past
midnight
goes
out
enter
a
band
of
singers
singing
all
blacks
and
whites
have
lost
their
distinction
and
have
become
red
red
as
the
tinge
of
your
feet
red
is
my
bodice
and
red
are
my
dreams
my
heart
sways
and
trembles
like
a
red
lotus
grandfather
excellent
my
friends
splendid
so
you
had
a
really
enjoyable
time
singers
oh
grand
everything
was
red
red
only
the
moon
in
the
sky
gave
us
the
slip
it
remained
white
grandfather
he
only
looks
so
innocent
from
the
outside
if
you
had
only
taken
off
his
white
disguise
you
would
have
seen
his
trickery
i
have
been
watching
what
red
colours
he
is
throwing
on
the
earth
and
yet
fancy
his
remaining
white
and
colourless
all
the
while
song
with
you
is
my
game
love
my
love
my
heart
is
mad
it
will
never
own
defeat
do
you
think
you
will
escape
stainless
yourself
reddening
me
with
red
powder
could
i
not
colour
your
robe
with
the
red
pollens
of
the
blossom
of
my
heart
they
go
out
enter
the
king
and
kanchi
kanchi
you
must
do
exactly
as
i
have
told
you
let
there
be
no
mistake
of
any
kind
king
there
shall
be
no
mistake
kanchi
the
queen
sudarshana
mansions
are
in
the
king
yes
sire
i
have
seen
the
place
well
kanchi
what
you
have
got
to
do
is
to
set
fire
to
the
garden
and
then
you
will
take
advantage
of
the
bustle
and
confusion
to
accomplish
your
object
straightway
king
i
shall
remember
kanchi
look
here
sir
pretender
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
a
needless
fear
is
troubling
us
there
is
really
no
king
in
this
country
king
my
sole
aim
is
to
rid
this
country
of
this
anarchy
your
common
man
can
not
live
without
a
king
whether
a
real
one
or
a
fraud
anarchy
is
always
a
source
of
danger
kanchi
pious
benefactor
of
the
people
your
wonderful
sacrifice
should
really
be
an
example
to
all
of
us
i
am
thinking
of
doing
this
extraordinary
service
to
the
people
myself
they
go
out
vi
rohini
what
is
the
matter
i
can
not
make
out
what
is
all
this
to
the
gardeners
where
are
you
all
going
away
in
such
a
hurry
first
gardener
we
are
going
out
of
the
garden
rohini
where
second
gardener
we
do
not
know
where
the
king
has
called
us
rohini
why
the
king
is
in
the
garden
which
king
has
called
you
first
gardener
we
can
not
say
second
gardener
the
king
we
have
been
serving
all
our
life
of
course
rohini
will
you
all
go
first
gardener
yes
all
we
have
to
go
instantly
otherwise
we
might
get
into
trouble
they
go
out
rohini
i
can
not
understand
their
words
i
am
afraid
they
are
scampering
off
like
wild
animals
that
fly
just
before
the
bank
of
a
river
breaks
down
into
the
water
enter
king
of
koshala
koshala
rohini
do
you
know
where
your
king
and
kanchi
have
gone
rohini
they
are
somewhere
in
the
garden
but
i
could
not
tell
you
where
koshala
i
can
not
really
understand
their
intentions
i
have
not
done
well
to
put
my
trust
in
kanchi
exit
rohini
what
is
this
dark
affair
going
on
amongst
these
kings
something
dreadful
is
going
to
happen
soon
shall
i
too
be
drawn
into
this
affair
enter
avanti
avanti
rohini
do
you
know
where
the
other
princes
are
rohini
it
is
difficult
to
say
which
of
them
is
where
the
king
of
koshala
just
passed
by
in
this
direction
avanti
i
am
not
thinking
of
koshala
where
are
your
king
and
kanchi
rohini
i
have
not
seen
them
for
a
long
time
avanti
kanchi
is
always
avoiding
us
he
is
certainly
planning
to
deceive
us
all
i
have
not
done
well
to
put
my
hand
in
this
imbroglio
friend
could
you
kindly
tell
me
any
way
out
of
this
garden
rohini
i
have
none
avanti
is
there
no
man
here
who
will
show
me
the
way
out
rohini
the
servants
have
all
left
the
garden
avanti
why
did
they
do
so
rohini
i
could
not
exactly
understand
what
they
meant
they
said
the
king
had
commanded
them
to
leave
the
garden
at
once
avanti
king
which
king
rohini
they
could
not
say
exactly
avanti
this
does
not
sound
well
i
shall
have
to
find
a
way
out
at
any
cost
i
can
not
stay
here
a
single
moment
more
goes
out
hurriedly
rohini
where
shall
i
find
the
king
when
i
gave
him
the
flowers
the
queen
had
sent
he
did
not
seem
much
interested
in
me
at
the
time
but
ever
since
that
hour
he
has
been
showering
gifts
and
presents
on
me
this
causeless
generosity
makes
me
more
afraid
where
are
the
birds
flying
at
such
an
hour
of
the
night
what
has
frightened
them
all
of
a
sudden
this
is
not
the
usual
time
of
their
flight
certainly
why
is
the
queen
pet
deer
running
that
way
chapata
chapata
she
does
not
even
hear
my
call
i
have
never
seen
a
night
like
this
the
horizon
on
every
side
suddenly
becomes
red
like
a
madman
eye
the
sun
seems
to
be
setting
at
this
untimely
hour
on
all
sides
at
the
same
time
what
madness
of
the
almighty
is
this
oh
i
am
frightened
where
shall
i
find
the
king
vii
at
the
door
of
the
queen
palace
king
what
is
this
you
have
done
kanchi
kanchi
i
wanted
to
fire
only
this
part
of
the
garden
near
the
palace
i
had
no
idea
that
it
would
spread
so
quickly
on
all
sides
tell
me
quick
the
way
out
of
this
garden
king
i
can
tell
you
nothing
about
it
those
who

native
of

have
never
entered
these
inner
royal
gardens
before
kanchi
i
wo
hear
of

you
must
show
me
the
way
or
i
shall
split
you
into
halves
king
you
may
take
my
life
by
that
means
but
it
would
be
a
very
precarious
method
of
finding
the
way
out
of
this
garden
kanchi
why
were
you
then
going
about
saying
that
you
were
the
king
of
this
country

a
rebel

is
the
use
of
shouting
and
cringing
to
the
empty
air

is
a
much
better
way
of
spending
the
time
to
search
for
the
way
king
i
shall
lie
down
here
i
shall
not
move
an
inch

not
look
on
you
any
more
black
as
the
threatening
black
as
the
shoreless
sea
with
the
spectral
red
tint
of
twilight
on
its
tumultuous
waves
king
have
i
not
told
you
before
that
one
can
not
bear
my
sight
unless
one
is
already
prepared
for
me
one
would
want
to
run
away
from
me
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
have
i
not
seen
this
times
without
number
that
is
why
i
wanted
to
reveal
myself
to
you
slowly
and
gradually
not
all
too
sudden
sudarshana
but
sin
came
and
destroyed
all
your
hopes
the
very
possibility
of
a
union
with
you
has
now
become
unthinkable
to
me
king
it
will
be
possible
in
time
my
queen
the
utter
and
bleak
blackness
that
has
shaken
you
to
your
soul
with
fear
will
one
day
be
your
solace
and
salvation
what
else
can
my
love
exist
for
sudarshana
it
can
not
be
it
is
not
possible
what
will
your
love
only
do
i
my
love
has
now
turned
away
from
you
beauty
has
cast
its
spell
on
me
this
frenzy
this
intoxication
will
never
leave
me
it
has
dazzled
and
fired
my
eyes
it
has
thrown
its
golden
glamour
over
my
very
dreams
i
have
told
you
all
now
punish
me
as
you
like
king
the
punishment
has
already
begun
sudarshana
but
if
you
do
not
cast
me
off
i
will
leave
you
king
you
have
the
utmost
liberty
to
do
as
you
like
sudarshana
i
can
not
bear
your
presence
my
heart
is
angry
at
you
why
did
you
but
what
have
you
done
to
me
why
are
you
like
this
why
did
they
tell
me
you
were
fair
and
handsome
thou
art
black
black
as
night
i
shall
never
i
can
never
like
you
i
have
seen
what
i
love
it
is
soft
as
cream
delicate
as
the
i
shirisha
flower
beautiful
as
a
butterfly
king
it
is
false
as
a
mirage
empty
as
a
bubble
sudarshana
let
it
be
but
i
can
not
stand
near
you
i
simply
can
not
i
must
fly
away
from
here
union
with
you
it
can
not
be
possible
it
can
not
be
anything
but
a
false
union
my
mind
must
inevitably
turn
away
from
you
king
will
you
not
even
try
a
little
sudarshana
i
have
been
trying
since
yesterday
but
the
more
i
try
the
more
rebellious
does
my
heart
become
if
i
stay
with
you
i
shall
constantly
be
pursued
and
hounded
by
the
thought
that
i
am
impure
that
i
am
false
and
faithless
king
well
then
you
can
go
as
far
from
me
as
you
like
sudarshana
i
can
not
fly
away
from
you
just
because
you
do
not
prevent
my
going
why
do
you
not
hold
me
back
hold
me
by
the
hair
saying
you
shall
not
go
why
do
you
not
strike
me
oh
punish
me
strike
me
beat
me
with
violent
hands
but
your
unresisting
silence
makes
me
wild
oh
i
can
not
bear
it
king
how
do
you
think
that
i
am
really
silent
how
do
you
know
that
i
am
not
trying
to
keep
you
back
sudarshana
oh
no
no
i
can
not
bear
this
tell
me
aloud
command
me
with
the
voice
of
thunder
compel
me
with
words
that
will
drown
everything
else
in
my
ears
do
not
let
me
off
so
easily
so
mildly
king
i
shall
leave
you
free
but
why
should
i
let
you
break
away
from
me
sudarshana
you
will
not
let
me
well
then
i
must
go
king
go
then
sudarshana
then
i
am
not
to
blame
at
all
you
could
have
held
me
back
by
force
but
you
did
not
you
have
not
hindered
me
and
now
i
shall
go
away
command
your
sentinels
to
prevent
my
going
king
no
one
will
stand
in
your
way
you
can
go
as
free
as
the
broken
driven
by
the
tempest
sudarshana
i
can
resist
no
more
something
in
me
is
impelling
me
forward
i
am
breaking
away
from
my
anchor
perhaps
i
shall
sink
but
i
shall
return
no
more
she
rushes
out
enter
surangama
who
sings
surangama
what
will
of
thine
is
this
that
sends
me
afar
again
shall
i
come
back
at
thy
feet
from
all
my
wanderings
it
is
thy
love
that
feigns
this
neglect
thy
caressing
hands
are
pushing
me
away
to
draw
me
back
to
thy
arms
again
o
my
king
what
is
this
game
that
thou
art
playing
throughout
thy
kingdom
sudarshana
king
o
king
surangama
he
has
gone
away
sudarshana
gone
away
well
then
then
he
has
cast
me
off
for
good
i
have
come
back
but
he
could
not
wait
a
single
instant
for
me
very
well
then
i
am
now
perfectly
free
surangama
did
he
ask
you
to
keep
me
back
surangama
no
he
said
nothing
sudarshana
why
should
he
say
anything
why
should
he
care
for
me
i
am
then
free
perfectly
free
but
surangama
i
wanted
to
ask
one
thing
of
the
king
but
could
not
utter
it
in
his
presence
tell
me
if
he
has
punished
the
prisoners
with
death
surangama
death
my
king
never
punishes
with
death
sudarshana
what
has
he
done
to
them
then
surangama
he
has
set
them
at
liberty
kanchi
has
acknowledged
his
defeat
and
gone
back
to
his
kingdom
sudarshana
ah
what
a
relief
surangama
my
queen

have
one
prayer
to
make
to
you
sudarshana
you
will
not
have
to
utter
your
prayer
in
words
surangama
whatever
jewellery
and
ornaments
the
king
gave
me
i
leave
to
you
i
am
not
worthy
to
wear
them
now
surangama

i
do
not
want
them
my
queen
my
master
has
never
given
me
any
ornaments
to
wear
my
unadorned
plainness

good
enough
for
me
he
has
not
given
me
anything
of
which
i
can
boast
before
people
sudarshana
what
do
you
want
of
me

far
from
him
when
you
are
going
out
unguarded
he
will
be
with
you
close
by
your
side
sudarshana
you
are
talking
nonsense
my
child
i
wanted
to
take
rohini
with
me

she
would
not
come

gives
you
courage
enough
to
wish
to
come
with
me
surangama
i
have
got
neither
courage
nor
strength
but
i
shall
go
courage
will
come
of
itself
and
strength

come
sudarshana

i
can
not
take
you
with
me
your
presence

constantly
remind
me
of
my
shame

shall
not
be
able
to
endure
that
surangama
o
my
queen

have
made
all
your
good
and
all
your
evil

as
well
will
you
treat
me
as
a
stranger

must
go
with
you

king
of
kanya
kubja
father
of
sudarshana
and
his
minister

kanya

waiting

the
city

on
the
bank
of
the
river

i
send
people
to
welcome
her
home
king
of
kanya
kubja
what
she
who
has
faithlessly
left
her
husband
do
you
propose
trumpeting
her
infamy
and
shame
to
every
one
by
getting
up
a
show
for
her
minister
shall
i
then
make
arrangements
for
her
residence
at
the
palace
king
of
kanya
kubja
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
she
has
left
her
place
as
the
empress
of
her
own
accord
here
she
will
have
to
work
as
a
if
she
wants
to
stay
in
my
house
minister
it
will
be
hard
and
bitter
to
her
your
highness
king
of
kanya
kubja
if
i
seek
to
save
her
from
her
sufferings
then
i
am
not
worthy
to
be
her
father
minister
i
shall
arrange
everything
as
you
wish
your
highness
king
of
kanya
kubja
let
it
be
kept
a
secret
that
she
is
my
daughter
otherwise
we
shall
all
be
in
an
awful
trouble
minister
why
do
you
fear
such
disaster
your
highness
king
of
kanya
kubja
when
woman
swerves
from
the
right
path
then
she
appears
fraught
with
the
direst
calamity
you
do
not
know
with
what
deadly
fear
this
daughter
of
mine
has
inspired
me
she
is
coming
to
my
home
laden
with
peril
and
danger
x
inner
apartments
of
the
palace
sudarshana
and
surangama
sudarshana
go
away
from
me
surangama
a
deadly
anger
rages
within
me
i
can
not
bear
anybody
it
makes
me
wild
to
see
you
so
patient
and
submissive
surangama
whom
are
you
angry
with
sudarshana
i
do
not
know
but
i
wish
to
see
everything
destroyed
and
convulsed
in
ruin
and
disaster
i
left
my
place
on
the
throne
as
the
empress
in
a
moment
time
did
i
lose
my
all
to
sweep
the
dust
to
sweat
and
slave
in
this
dismal
hole
why
do
the
torches
of
mourning
not
flare
up
for
me
all
over
the
world
why
does
not
the
earth
quake
and
tremble
is
my
fall
but
the
unobserved
dropping
of
the
puny
is
it
not
more
like
the
fall
of
a
glowing
star
whose
fiery
blazon
bursts
the
heavens
asunder
surangama
a
mighty
forest
only
smokes
and
smoulders
before
it
bursts
into
a
conflagration
the
time
has
not
come
yet
sudarshana
i
have
thrown
my
queen
honour
and
glory
to
the
dust
and
winds
but
is
there
no
human
being
who
will
come
out
to
meet
my
desolate
soul
here
alone
oh
i
am
fearfully
terribly
alone
surangama
you
are
not
alone
sudarshana
surangama
i
shall
not
keep
anything
from
you
when
he
set
the
palace
on
fire
i
could
not
be
angry
with
him
a
great
inward
joy
set
my
heart
all
the
while
what
a
stupendous
crime
what
glorious
prowess
it
was
this
courage
that
made
me
strong
and
fired
my
own
spirits
it
was
this
terrible
joy
that
enabled
me
to
leave
everything
behind
me
in
a
moment
time
but
is
it
all
my
imagination
only
why
is
there
no
sign
of
his
coming
anywhere
surangama
he
of
whom
you
are
thinking
did
not
set
fire
to
the
palace
it
is
the
king
of
kanchi
who
did
it
sudarshana
coward
but
is
it
possible
so
handsome
so
bewitching
and
yet
no
manhood
in
him
have
i
deceived
myself
for
the
sake
of
such
a
worthless
creature
o
shame
fie
on
me
but
surangama
do
you
think
that
your
king
should
yet
have
come
to
take
me
back
surangama
remains
silent
you
think
i
am
anxious
to
go
back
never
even
if
the
king
really
came
i
should
not
have
returned
not
even
once
did
he
forbid
me
to
come
away
and
i
found
all
the
doors
wide
open
to
let
me
out
and
the
stony
and
dusty
road
over
which
i
walked
it
was
nothing
to
it
that
a
queen
was
treading
on
it
it
is
hard
and
has
no
feelings
like
your
king
the
meanest
beggar
is
the
same
to
it
as
the
highest
empress
you
are
silent
well
i
tell
you
your
behaviour
is
mean
brutal
shameful
surangama
every
one
knows
that
my
king
is
hard
and
pitiless
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
move
him
sudarshana
why
do
you
then
call
him
day
and
night
surangama
may
he
ever
remain
hard
and
relentless
like
rock
may
my
tears
and
prayers
never
move
him
let
my
sorrows
be
ever
mine
only
and
may
his
glory
and
victory
be
for
ever
sudarshana
surangama
look
a
cloud
of
dust
seems
to
rise
over
the
eastern
horizon
across
the
fields
surangama
yes
i
see
it
sudarshana
is
that
not
like
the
banner
of
a
chariot
surangama
indeed
a
banner
it
is
sudarshana
then
he
is
coming
he
has
come
at
last
surangama
who
is
coming
sudarshana
our
king
who
else
how
could
he
live
without
me
it
is
a
wonder
how
he
could
hold
out
even
for
these
days
surangama
no
no
this
can
not
be
the
king
sudarshana
no
indeed
as
if
you
know
everything
your
king
is
hard
stony
pitiless
is
he
let
us
see
how
hard
he
can
be
i
knew
from
the
beginning
that
he
would
come
that
he
would
have
to
rush
after
me
but
remember
surangama
i
never
for
a
single
moment
asked
him
to
come
you
will
see
how
i
make
your
king
confess
his
defeat
to
me
just
go
out
surangama
and
let
me
know
everything
surangama
goes
out
but
shall
i
go
if
he
comes
and
asks
me
to
return
with
him
certainly
not
i
will
not
go
never
enter
surangama
surangama
it
is
not
the
king
my
queen
sudarshana
not
the
king
are
you
quite
sure
what
he
has
not
come
yet
surangama
no
my
king
never
raises
so
much
dust
when
he
comes
nobody
can
know
when
he
comes
at
all
sudarshana
then
this
is
surangama
the
same
he
is
coming
with
the
king
of
kanchi
sudarshana
do
you
know
his
name
surangama
his
name
is
suvarna
sudarshana
it
is
he
then
i
thought
i
am
lying
here
like
waste
refuse
and
offal
which
no
one
cares
even
to
touch
but
my
hero
is
coming
now
to
release
me
did
you
know
suvarna
surangama
when
i
was
at
my
father
home
in
the
gambling
den
sudarshana
no
no
i
wo
hear
anything
of
him
from
you
he
is
my
own
hero
my
only
salvation
i
shall
know
him
without
your
telling
stories
about
him
but
just
see
a
nice
man
your
king
is
he
did
not
care
to
come
to
rescue
me
from
even
this
degradation
you
can
not
blame
me
after
this
i
could
not
have
waited
for
him
all
my
life
here
toiling
ignominiously
like
a
bondslave
i
shall
never
have
i
your
meekness
and
submissiveness
xi
encampment
kanchi
to
kanya
kubja
messenger
tell
your
king
that
he
need
not
receive
us
exactly
as
his
guests
we
are
on
our
way
back
to
our
kingdoms
but
we
are
waiting
to
rescue
queen
sudarshana
from
the
servitude
and
degradation
to
which
she
is
condemned
here
messenger
your
highness
you
will
remember
that
the
princess
is
in
her
father
house
kanchi
a
daughter
may
stay
in
her
father
home
only
so
long
as
she
remains
unmarried
messenger
but
her
connections
with
her
father
family
remain
intact
still
kanchi
she
has
abjured
all
such
relations
now
messenger
such
relationship
can
never
be
abjured
your
highness
on
this
side
of
death
it
may
remain
in
abeyance
at
times
but
can
never
be
wholly
broken
up
kanchi
if
the
king
chooses
not
to
give
up
his
daughter
to
me
on
peaceful
terms
our
i
kshatriya
code
of
righteousness
will
oblige
me
to
employ
force
you
may
take
this
as
my
last
word
messenger
your
highness
do
not
forget
that
our
king
too
is
bound
by
the
same
code
it
is
idle
to
expect
that
he
will
deliver
up
his
daughter
by
merely
hearing
your
threats
kanchi
tell
your
king
that
i
have
come
prepared
for
such
an
answer
messenger
goes
out
suvarna
king
of
kanchi
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
daring
too
much
kanchi
what
pleasure
would
there
be
in
this
adventure
if
it
were
otherwise
suvarna
it
does
not
cost
much
courage
to
challenge
kanya
kubja
but
kanchi
if
you
once
begin
to
be
afraid
of
but
you
will
hardly
find
a
place
in
this
world
safe
enough
for
you
enter
a
soldier
soldier
your
highness
i
have
just
received
the
news
that
the
kings
of
koshala
avanti
and
kalinga
are
coming
this
way
with
their
armies
exit
kanchi
just
what
i
was
afraid
of
the
report
of
flight
has
spread
abroad
now
we
are
going
to
be
in
for
a
general
scramble
which
is
sure
to
end
in
smoke
suvarna
it
is
useless
now
your
highness
these
are
not
good
tidings
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
it
is
our
emperor
himself
who
has
secretly
spread
the
report
everywhere
kanchi
why
what
good
will
it
bring
him
suvarna
the
greedy
ones
will
tear
one
another
to
pieces
in
the
general
rivalry
and
scramble
and
he
will
take
advantage
of
the
situation
to
go
back
with
the
booty
kanchi
now
it
becomes
clear
why
your
king
never
shows
himself
his
trick
is
to
multiply
himself
on
every
side
fear
makes
him
visible
everywhere
but
i
will
still
maintain
that
your
king
is
but
an
empty
fraud
from
top
to
bottom
suvarna
but
please
your
highness
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
let
me
off
kanchi
i
can
not
let
you
go
i
have
some
use
for
you
in
this
affair
enter
a
soldier
soldier
your
highness
virat
panchal
and
vidarbha
too
have
come
they
have
encamped
on
the
other
side
of
the
exit
kanchi
in
the
beginning
we
must
all
fight
together
let
the
battle
with
kanya
kubja
first
be
over
then
we
shall
find
some
way
out
of
the
difficulty
suvarna
please
do
not
drag
me
into
your
plans
i
shall
be
happy
if
you
leave
me
alone
i
am
a
poor
mean
creature
nothing
can
kanchi
look
here
king
of
hypocrites
ways
and
means
are
never
of
a
very
exalted
order
roads
and
stairs
and
so
forth
are
always
to
be
trodden
under
our
feet
the
advantage
of
utilising
men
like
you
in
our
plans
is
that
we
have
to
make
use
of
no
mask
or
illusion
but
if
i
were
to
consult
my
prime
minister
it
would
be
absurd
for
me
to
call
theft
by
any
name
less
dignified
than
public
benefit
i
will
go
now
and
move
the
princes
about
like
pawns
on
the
chessboard
the
game
can
not
evidently
go
on
if
all
the
chessmen
propose
moving
like
kings
xii
interior
of
the
palace
sudarshana
is
the
fight
still
going
on
surangama
as
fiercely
as
ever
sudarshana
before
going
out
to
the
battle
my
father
came
to
me
and
said
you
have
come
away
from
one
king
but
you
have
drawn
seven
kings
after
you
i
have
a
mind
to
cut
you
up
into
seven
pieces
and
distribute
them
among
the
princes
it
would
have
been
well
if
he
did
so
surangama
surangama
yes
sudarshana
if
your
king
had
the
power
to
save
me
could
my
present
state
have
left
him
unmoved
surangama
my
queen
why
do
you
ask
me
have
i
the
power
to
answer
for
my
king
i
know
my
understanding
is
dark
that
is
why
i
never
dare
to
judge
him
sudarshana
who
have
joined
in
this
fight
surangama
all
the
seven
princes
sudarshana
no
one
else
surangama
suvarna
attempted
to
escape
in
secret
before
the
fight
began
but
kanchi
has
kept
him
a
prisoner
in
his
camps
sudarshana
oh
i
should
have
been
dead
long
ago
but
o
king
my
king
if
you
had
come
and
helped
my
father
your
fame
would
have
been
none
the
less
it
would
have
become
brighter
and
higher
are
you
quite
sure
surangama
that
he
has
not
come
surangama
i
know
nothing
for
certain
sudarshana
but
since
i
came
here
i
have
felt
suddenly
many
a
time
as
if
somebody
were
playing
on
a
i
vina
below
my
window
surangama
there
is
nothing
impossible
in
the
idea
that
somebody
indulges
his
taste
for
music
there
sudarshana
there
is
a
deep
thicket
below
my
window
i
try
to
find
out
who
it
is
every
time
i
hear
the
music
but
i
can
see
nothing
distinctly
surangama
perhaps
some
wayfarer
rests
in
the
shade
and
plays
on
the
instrument
sudarshana
it
may
be
so
but
my
old
window
in
the
palace
comes
back
to
my
memory
i
used
to
come
after
dressing
in
the
evening
and
stand
at
my
window
and
out
of
the
blank
darkness
of
our
lampless
used
to
stream
forth
strains
and
songs
and
melodies
dancing
and
vibrating
in
endless
succession
and
overflowing
profusion
like
the
passionate
exuberance
of
a
ceaseless
fountain
surangama
o
deep
and
sweet
darkness
the
profound
and
mystic
darkness
whose
servant
i
was
sudarshana
why
did
you
come
away
with
me
from
that
room
surangama
because
i
knew
he
would
follow
us
and
take
us
back
sudarshana
but
no
he
will
not
come
he
has
left
us
for
good
why
should
he
not
surangama
if
he
can
leave
us
like
that
then
we
have
no
need
of
him
then
he
does
not
exist
for
us
then
that
dark
chamber
is
totally
empty
and
void
no
vina
ever
breathed
its
music
there
none
called
you
or
me
in
that
chamber
then
everything
has
been
a
delusion
and
an
idle
dream
enter
the
doorkeeper
sudarshana
who
are
you
doorkeeper
i
am
the
porter
of
this
palace
sudarshana
tell
me
quickly
what
you
have
got
to
say
doorkeeper
our
king
has
been
taken
prisoner
sudarshana
prisoner
o
mother
earth
faints
xiii
king
of
kanchi
and
suvarna
suvarna
you
say
then
that
there
will
be
no
more
necessity
of
any
fight
amongst
yourselves
kanchi
no
you
need
not
be
afraid
i
have
made
all
the
princes
agree
that
he
whom
the
queen
accepts
as
her
husband
will
have
her
and
the
others
will
have
to
abandon
all
further
struggle
suvarna
but
you
must
have
done
with
me
now
your
highness
so
i
beg
to
be
let
off
now
unfit
as
i
am
for
anything
the
fear
of
impending
danger
has
unnerved
me
and
stunned
my
intellect
you
will
therefore
find
it
difficult
to
put
me
to
any
use
kanchi
you
will
have
to
sit
there
as
my
suvarna
your
servant
is
ready
for
anything
but
of
what
profit
will
that
be
to
you
kanchi
my
man
i
see
that
your
weak
intellect
can
not
go
with
a
high
ambition
in
you
you
have
no
notion
yet
with
what
favour
the
queen
looked
upon
you
after
all
she
can
not
possibly
throw
the
bridal
garland
on
an
neck
in
a
company
of
princes
and
yet
i
know
she
will
not
be
able
to
turn
her
mind
away
from
you
so
on
all
accounts
this
garland
will
fall
under
the
shade
of
my
regal
umbrella
suvarna
your
highness
you
are
entertaining
dangerous
imaginings
about
me
i
pray
you
please
do
not
implicate
me
in
the
toils
of
such
groundless
notions
i
beg
your
highness
most
humbly
pray
set
me
at
liberty
kanchi
as
soon
as
my
object
is
attained
i
shall
not
keep
you
one
moment
from
your
liberty
once
the
end
is
attained
it
is
futile
to
burden
oneself
with
the
means
xiv
sudarshana
and
surangama
at
the
window
sudarshana
must
i
go
to
the
assembly
of
the
princes
then
is
there
no
other
means
of
saving
father
life
surangama
the
king
of
kanchi
has
said
so
sudarshana
are
these
the
words
worthy
of
a
king
did
he
say
so
with
his
own
lips
surangama
no
his
messenger
suvarna
brought
this
news
sudarshana
woe
woe
is
me
surangama
and
he
produced
a
few
withered
flowers
and
said
tell
your
queen
that
the
drier
and
more
withered
these
souvenirs
of
the
spring
festival
become
the
fresher
and
more
blooming
do
they
grow
within
in
my
heart
sudarshana
stop
tell
me
no
more
do
not
torment
me
any
more
surangama
look
there
sit
all
the
princes
in
the
great
assembly
he
who
has
no
ornament
on
his
person
except
a
single
garland
of
flowers
round
his
crown
he
is
the
king
of
kanchi
and
he
who
holds
the
umbrella
over
his
head
standing
behind
him
that
is
suvarna
sudarshana
is
that
suvarna
are
you
quite
certain
surangama
yes
i
know
him
well
sudarshana
can
it
be
that
it
is
this
man
that
i
saw
the
other
day
no
no
i
saw
something
mingled
and
transfused
and
blended
with
light
and
darkness
with
wind
and
perfume
no
no
it
can
not
be
he
that
is
not
he
surangama
but
every
one
admits
that
he
is
exceedingly
beautiful
to
look
at
sudarshana
how
could
that
beauty
fascinate
me
oh
what
shall
i
do
to
purge
my
eyes
of
their
pollution
surangama
you
will
have
to
wash
them
in
that
bottomless
darkness
sudarshana
but
tell
me
surangama
why
does
one
make
such
mistakes
surangama
mistakes
are
but
the
preludes
to
their
own
destruction
messenger
entering
princess
the
kings
are
waiting
for
you
in
the
hall
exit
sudarshana
surangama
bring
me
the
veil
surangama
goes
out
o
king
my
only
king
you
have
left
me
alone
and
you
have
been
but
just
in
doing
so
but
will
you
not
know
the
inmost
truth
within
my
soul
taking
out
a
dagger
from
within
her
bosom
this
body
of
mine
has
received
a
stain
i
shall
make
a
sacrifice
of
it
in
the
dust
of
the
hall
before
all
these
princes
but
shall
i
never
be
able
to
tell
you
that
i
know
of
no
stain
of
faithlessness
within
the
hidden
chambers
of
my
heart
that
dark
chamber
where
you
would
come
to
meet
me
lies
cold
and
empty
within
my
bosom
but
o
my
lord
none
has
opened
its
doors
none
has
entered
it
but
you
o
king
will
you
never
come
again
to
open
those
doors
then
let
death
come
for
it
is
dark
like
yourself
and
its
features
are
beautiful
as
yours
it
is
you
it
is
yourself
o
king
xv
the
gathering
of
the
princes
vidarbha
king
of
kanchi
how
is
it
that
you
have
not
got
a
single
piece
of
ornament
on
your
person
kanchi
because
i
entertain
no
hopes
at
all
my
friend
ornaments
would
but
double
the
shame
of
my
defeat
kalinga
but
your
seems
to
have
made
up
for
that
he
is
loaded
with
gold
and
jewellery
all
over
virat
the
king
of
kanchi
wants
to
demonstrate
the
futility
and
inferiority
of
outer
beauty
and
grandeur
vanity
of
his
prowess
has
made
him
discard
all
outer
embellishments
from
his
limbs
kosliala
i
am
quite
up
to
his
trickery
he
is
seeking
to
prove
his
own
dignity
maintaining
a
severe
plainness
among
the
bejewelled
princes
panchala
i
can
not
commend
his
wisdom
in
this
matter
every
one
knows
that
a
woman
eyes
are
like
a
moth
in
that
they
fling
themselves
headlong
on
the
glare
and
glitter
of
jewel
and
gold
kalinga
but
how
long
shall
we
have
to
wait
more
kanchi
do
not
grow
impatient
king
of
kalinga
sweet
are
the
fruits
of
delay
kalinga
if
i
were
sure
of
the
fruit
i
could
have
endured
it
it
is
because
my
hopes
of
tasting
the
fruit
are
extremely
precarious
that
my
eagerness
to
have
a
sight
of
her
breaks
through
all
bounds
kanchi
but
you
are
young
still
abandoned
hope
comes
back
to
you
again
and
again
like
a
shameless
woman
at
your
age
we
however
have
long
passed
that
stage
koshala
kanchi
did
you
feel
as
if
something
shook
your
seat
just
now
is
it
an
earthquake
kanchi
earthquake
i
do
not
know
vidarbha
or
perhaps
some
other
prince
is
coming
with
his
army
kalinga
there
is
nothing
against
your
theory
except
that
we
should
have
first
heard
the
news
from
some
herald
or
messenger
in
that
case
vidarbha
i
can
not
regard
this
as
a
very
auspicious
omen
kanchi
everything
looks
inauspicious
to
the
eye
of
fear
vidarbha
i
fear
none
except
fate
before
which
courage
or
heroism
is
as
futile
as
it
is
absurd
panchala
vidarbha
do
not
darken
happy
proceedings
with
your
unwelcome
prognostications
kanchi
i
never
take
the
unseen
into
account
till
it
has
become
seen
vidarbha
but
then
it
might
be
too
late
to
do
anything
panchala
did
we
not
all
of
us
start
at
a
specially
auspicious
moment
vidarbha
do
you
think
you
insure
against
every
possible
risk
by
starting
at
auspicious
moments
it
looks
as
if
kanchi
you
had
better
let
the
as
if
alone
though
our
own
creation
it
often
proves
our
ruin
and
destruction
kalinga
is
that
music
somewhere
outside
panchala
yes
it
sounds
like
music
sure
enough
kanchi
then
at
last
it
must
be
the
queen
sudarshana
who
is
approaching
near
aside
to
suvarna
suvarna
you
must
not
hide
and
cower
behind
me
like
that
mind
the
umbrella
in
your
hand
is
shaking
enter
grandfather
dressed
as
a
warrior
kalinga
who
is
that
who
are
you
panchala
who
is
this
that
dares
to
enter
this
hall
without
being
invited
virat
amazing
impudence
kalinga
just
prevent
the
fellow
from
advancing
further
kalinga
you
are
all
my
superiors
in
age
you
are
fitter
to
do
that
than
myself
vidarbha
let
us
hear
what
he
has
to
say
grandfather
the
king
has
come
vidarbha
starting
king
panchala
which
king
kalinga
where
does
he
come
from
grandfather
my
king
virat
your
king
kalinga
who
is
he
koshala
what
do
you
mean
grandfather
you
all
know
whom
i
mean
he
has
come
vidarbha
he
has
come
koshala
with
what
intention
grandfather
he
has
summoned
you
all
to
come
to
him
kanchi
summoned
us
indeed
in
what
terms
has
he
been
pleased
to
summon
us
grandfather
you
can
take
his
call
in
any
way
you
like
there
is
none
to
prevent
you
he
is
prepared
to
make
all
kinds
of
welcome
to
suit
your
various
tastes
virat
but
who
are
you
grandfather
i
am
one
of
his
generals
kanchi
generals
it
is
a
lie
do
you
think
of
frightening
us
do
you
imagine
that
i
can
not
see
through
your
disguise
we
all
know
you
well
and
you
pose
as
a
general
before
us
grandfather
you
have
recognised
me
to
perfection
who
is
so
unworthy
as
i
to
bear
my
king
commands
and
yet
it
is
he
who
has
invested
me
with
these
robes
of
a
general
and
sent
me
here
he
has
chosen
me
before
greater
generals
and
mightier
warriors
kanchi
all
right
we
shall
go
to
observe
the
proprieties
and
amenities
on
a
fitting
occasion
but
at
present
we
are
in
the
midst
of
a
pressing
engagement
he
will
have
to
wait
till
this
little
function
is
over
grandfather
when
he
sends
out
his
call
he
does
not
wait
koshala
i
shall
obey
his
call
i
am
going
at
once
vidarbha
kanchi
i
can
not
agree
with
you
in
your
proposal
to
wait
till
this
function
is
over
i
am
going
kalinga
you
are
older
than
i
am
i
shall
follow
you
panchala
look
behind
you
prince
of
kanchi
your
regal
umbrella
is
lying
in
the
dust
you
have
not
noticed
when
your
has
stolen
away
kanchi
all
right
general
i
too
am
going
but
not
to
do
him
homage
i
go
to
fight
him
on
the
grandfather
you
will
meet
my
king
in
the
field
of
battle
that
is
no
mean
place
for
your
reception
virat
look
here
friends
perhaps
we
are
all
flying
before
an
imagined
terror
it
looks
as
if
the
king
of
kanchi
will
have
the
best
of
it
panchala
possibly
when
the
fruit
is
so
near
the
hand
it
is
cowardly
and
foolish
to
go
away
without
plucking
it
kalinga
it
is
better
to
join
the
king
of
kanchi
he
can
not
be
without
a
definite
plan
and
purpose
when
he
is
doing
and
daring
so
much
xvi
sudarshana
and
surangama
sudarshana
the
fight
is
over
now
when
will
the
king
come
surangama
i
do
not
know
myself
i
am
also
looking
forward
to
his
coming
sudarshana
i
feel
such
a
throb
of
joy
surangama
that
my
breast
is
positively
aching
but
i
am
dying
with
shame
too
how
shall
i
show
my
face
to
him
surangama
go
to
him
in
utmost
humility
and
resignation
and
all
shame
will
vanish
in
a
moment
sudarshana
i
can
not
help
confessing
that
i
have
met
with
my
uttermost
defeat
for
all
the
rest
of
my
life
but
pride
made
me
claim
the
largest
share
in
his
love
so
long
every
one
used
to
say
i
had
such
wonderful
beauty
such
graces
and
virtues
every
one
used
to
say
that
the
king
showed
unlimited
kindness
towards
me
this
is
what
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
bend
my
heart
in
humility
before
him
surangama
this
difficulty
my
queen
will
pass
off
sudarshana
oh
yes
it
will
pass
the
day
has
arrived
for
me
to
humble
myself
before
the
whole
world
but
why
does
not
the
king
come
to
take
me
back
what
more
is
he
waiting
for
yet
surangama
have
i
not
told
you
my
king
is
cruel
and
hard
very
hard
indeed
sudarshana
go
out
surangama
and
bring
me
news
of
him
surangama
i
do
not
know
where
i
should
go
to
get
any
news
of
him
i
have
asked
grandfather
to
come
perhaps
when
he
comes
we
shall
hear
something
from
him
sudarshana
alack
my
evil
fate
i
have
been
reduced
to
asking
others
to
hear
about
my
own
king
transciber
note
alack
should
probably
be
replaced
with
alas
enter
grandfather
sudarshana
i
have
heard
that
you
are
my
king
friend
so
accept
my
obeisance
and
give
me
your
blessings
grandfather
what
are
you
doing
queen
i
never
accept
anybody
obeisance
my
relation
with
every
one
is
only
that
of
comradeship
sudarshana
smile
on
me
then
give
me
good
news
tell
me
when
the
king
is
coming
to
take
me
back
grandfather
you
ask
me
a
hard
question
indeed
i
hardly
understand
yet
the
ways
of
my
friend
the
battle
is
over
but
no
one
can
tell
where
he
is
gone
sudarshana
is
he
gone
away
then
grandfather
i
can
not
find
any
trace
of
him
here
sudarshana
has
he
gone
and
do
you
call
such
a
person
your
friend
grandfather
that
is
why
he
gets
people
abuse
as
well
as
suspicion
but
my
king
simply
does
not
mind
it
in
the
least
sudarshana
has
he
gone
away
oh
oh
how
hard
how
cruel
how
cruel
he
is
made
of
stone
he
is
hard
as
adamant
i
tried
to
move
him
with
my
own
bosom
my
breast
is
torn
and
bleeding
but
him
i
could
not
move
an
inch
grandfather
tell
me
how
can
you
manage
with
such
a
friend
grandfather
i
have
known
him
now
i
have
known
him
through
my
griefs
and
joys
he
can
make
me
weep
no
more
now
sudarshana
will
he
not
let
me
know
him
also
grandfather
why
he
will
of
course
nothing
else
will
satisfy
him
sudarshana
very
well
i
shall
see
how
hard
he
can
be
i
shall
stay
here
near
the
window
without
saying
a
word
i
shall
not
move
an
inch
let
me
see
if
he
will
not
come
grandfather
you
are
young
still
you
can
afford
to
wait
for
him
but
to
me
an
old
man
a
moment
loss
is
a
week
i
must
set
out
to
seek
him
whether
i
succeed
or
exit
sudarshana
i
do
not
want
him
i
will
not
seek
him
surangama
i
have
no
need
of
your
king
why
did
he
fight
with
the
princes
was
it
for
me
at
all
did
he
want
to
show
off
his
prowess
and
strength
go
away
from
here
i
can
not
bear
your
sight
he
has
humbled
me
to
the
dust
and
is
not
satisfied
still
xvii
a
band
of
citizens
first
citizen
when
so
many
kings
met
together
we
thought
we
were
going
to
have
some
big
fun
but
somehow
everything
took
such
a
turn
that
nobody
knows
what
happened
at
all
second
citizen
did
you
not
see
they
could
not
come
to
an
agreement
among
themselves
every
one
distrusted
every
one
else
third
citizen
none
kept
to
their
original
plans
one
wanted
to
advance
another
thought
it
better
policy
to
recede
some
went
to
the
right
others
made
a
rush
to
the
left
how
can
you
call
that
a
fight
first
citizen
they
had
no
eye
to
real
fighting
each
had
his
eye
on
the
others
second
citizen
each
was
thinking
why
should
i
die
to
enable
others
to
reap
the
harvest
third
citizen
but
you
must
all
admit
that
kanchi
fought
like
a
real
hero
first
citizen
he
for
a
long
time
after
his
defeat
seemed
loth
to
acknowledge
himself
beaten
second
citizen
he
was
at
last
fixed
in
the
chest
by
a
deadly
missile
third
citizen
but
before
that
he
did
not
seem
to
realise
that
he
had
been
losing
ground
at
every
step
first
citizen
as
for
the
other
kings
well
nobody
knows
where
they
fled
leaving
poor
kanchi
alone
in
the
field
second
citizen
but
i
have
heard
that
he
is
not
dead
yet
third
citizen
no
the
physicians
have
saved
him
but
he
will
carry
the
mark
of
his
defeat
on
his
breast
till
his
dying
day
first
citizen
none
of
the
other
kings
who
fled
has
escaped
they
have
all
been
taken
prisoners
but
what
sort
of
justice
is
this
that
was
meted
out
to
them
second
citizen
i
heard
that
every
one
was
punished
except
kanchi
whom
the
judge
placed
on
his
right
on
the
throne
of
justice
putting
a
crown
on
his
head
third
citizen
this
beats
all
mystery
hollow
second
citizen
this
sort
of
justice
to
speak
frankly
strikes
us
as
fantastic
and
capricious
first
citizen
just
so
the
greatest
offender
is
certainly
the
king
of
kanchi
as
for
the
others
greed
of
gain
now
pressed
them
to
advance
now
they
drew
back
in
fear
third
citizen
what
kind
of
justice
is
this
i
ask
it
is
as
if
the
tiger
got
while
his
tail
got
cut
off
second
citizen
if
i
were
the
judge
do
you
think
kanchi
would
be
whole
and
sound
at
this
hour
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
him
altogether
third
citizen
they
are
great
high
justices
my
friends
their
brains
are
of
a
different
stamp
from
ours
first
citizen
have
they
got
any
brains
at
all
i
wonder
they
simply
indulge
their
sweet
whims
as
there
are
none
to
say
anything
to
them
from
above
second
citizen
whatever
you
may
say
if
we
had
the
governing
power
in
our
hands
we
should
certainly
have
carried
on
the
government
much
better
than
this
third
citizen
can
there
be
any
real
doubts
about
that
that
of
course
goes
without
saying
xviii
the
street
grandfather
and
kanchi
grandfather
what
prince
of
kanchi
you
here
kanchi
your
king
has
sent
me
on
the
road
grandfather
that
is
a
settled
habit
with
him
kanchi
and
now
no
one
can
get
a
glimpse
of
him
grandfather
that
too
is
one
of
his
amusements
kanchi
but
how
long
more
will
he
elude
me
like
this
when
nothing
could
make
me
acknowledge
him
as
my
king
he
came
all
of
a
sudden
like
a
terrific
tempest
god
knows
from
where
and
scattered
my
men
and
horses
and
banners
in
one
wild
tumult
but
now
when
i
am
seeking
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
pay
him
my
humble
homage
he
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
grandfather
but
however
big
an
emperor
he
may
be
he
has
to
submit
to
him
that
yields
but
why
have
you
come
out
at
night
prince
kanchi
i
still
can
not
get
rid
of
the
feeling
of
a
secret
dread
of
being
laughed
at
by
people
when
they
see
me
meekly
doing
my
homage
to
your
king
acknowledging
my
defeat
grandfather
such
indeed
is
the
people
what
would
move
others
to
tears
only
serves
to
move
their
empty
laughter
kanchi
but
you
too
are
on
the
road
grandfather
grandfather
this
is
my
jolly
pilgrimage
to
the
land
of
losing
everything
sings
i
am
waiting
with
my
all
in
the
hope
of
losing
everything
i
am
watching
at
the
roadside
for
him
who
turns
one
out
into
the
open
road
who
hides
himself
and
sees
who
loves
you
unknown
to
you
i
have
given
my
heart
in
secret
love
to
him
i
am
waiting
with
my
all
in
the
hope
of
losing
everything
xix
a
road
sudarshana
and
surangama
sudarshana
what
a
relief
surangama
what
freedom
it
is
my
defeat
that
has
brought
me
freedom
oh
what
an
iron
pride
was
mine
nothing
could
move
it
or
soften
it
my
darkened
mind
could
not
in
any
way
be
brought
to
see
the
plain
truth
that
it
was
not
the
king
who
was
to
come
it
was
i
who
ought
to
have
gone
to
him
all
through
yesternight
i
lay
alone
on
the
dusty
floor
before
that
window
lay
there
through
the
desolate
hours
and
wept
all
night
the
southern
winds
blew
and
shrieked
and
moaned
like
the
pain
that
was
biting
at
my
heart
and
all
through
it
i
heard
the
plaintive
speak
wife
of
the
nightbird
echoing
in
the
tumult
outside
it
was
the
helpless
wail
of
the
dark
night
surangama
surangama
last
night
heavy
and
melancholy
air
seemed
to
hang
on
for
an
eternity
oh
what
a
dismal
and
gboomy
night
sudarshana
but
would
you
believe
it
i
seemed
to
hear
the
soft
strains
of
the
i
vina
floating
through
all
that
wild
din
and
tumult
could
he
play
such
sweet
and
tender
tunes
he
who
is
so
cruel
and
terrible
the
world
knows
only
my
indignity
and
ignominy
but
none
but
my
own
heart
could
hear
those
strains
that
called
me
through
the
lone
and
wailing
night
did
you
too
surangama
hear
the
i
vina
or
was
that
but
a
dream
of
mine
surangama
but
it
is
just
to
hear
that
same
i
vina
music
that
i
am
always
by
your
side
it
is
for
this
call
of
music
which
i
knew
would
one
day
come
to
dissolve
all
the
barriers
of
love
that
i
have
all
along
been
listening
with
an
eager
ear
sudarshana
he
did
at
last
send
me
on
the
open
road
i
could
not
withstand
his
will
when
i
shall
find
him
the
first
words
that
i
shall
tell
him
will
be
i
have
come
of
my
own
will
i
have
not
awaited
your
coming
i
shall
say
for
your
sake
have
i
trodden
the
hard
and
weary
roads
and
bitter
and
ceaseless
has
been
my
weeping
all
the
way
i
shall
at
least
have
this
pride
in
me
when
i
meet
him
surangama
but
even
that
pride
will
not
last
he
came
before
you
did
who
else
could
have
sent
you
on
the
road
sudarshana
perhaps
he
did
as
long
as
a
sense
of
offended
pride
remained
with
me
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
had
left
me
for
good
but
when
i
flung
my
dignity
and
pride
to
the
winds
and
came
out
on
the
common
streets
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
too
had
come
out
i
have
been
finding
him
since
the
moment
i
was
on
the
road
i
have
no
misgivings
now
all
this
suffering
that
i
have
gone
through
for
his
sake
the
very
bitternesss
of
all
this
is
giving
me
his
company
ah
yes
he
has
come
he
has
held
me
by
the
hand
just
as
he
used
to
do
in
that
chamber
of
darkness
when
at
his
touch
all
my
body
would
start
with
a
sudden
thrill
it
is
the
same
the
same
touch
again
who
says
that
he
is
not
here
surangama
can
you
not
see
that
he
has
come
in
silence
and
secret
who
is
that
there
look
surangama
there
is
a
third
traveller
of
this
dark
road
at
this
hour
of
the
night
surangama
i
see
it
is
the
king
of
kanchi
my
queen
sudarshana
king
of
kanchi
surangama
do
be
afraid
my
queen
sudarshana
afraid
why
should
i
be
afraid
the
days
of
fear
are
gone
for
ever
for
me
kanchi
entering
i
see
you
two
on
this
road
i
am
a
traveller
of
the
same
path
as
yourself
have
no
fear
of
me
o
queen
sudarshana
it
is
well
king
of
kanchi
that
we
should
be
going
together
side
by
side
this
is
but
right
i
came
on
your
way
when
i
first
left
my
home
and
now
i
meet
you
again
on
my
way
back
who
could
have
dreamed
that
this
meeting
of
ours
would
augur
so
well
kanchi
but
it
is
not
meet
that
you
should
walk
over
this
road
on
foot
will
you
permit
me
to
get
a
chariot
for
you
sudarshana
oh
do
not
say
so
i
shall
never
be
happy
if
i
could
not
on
my
way
back
home
tread
on
the
dust
of
the
road
that
led
me
away
from
my
king
i
would
be
deceiving
myself
if
i
were
now
to
go
in
a
chariot
surangama
king
you
too
are
walking
in
the
dust
this
road
has
never
known
anybody
driving
his
horse
or
chariot
over
it
sudarshana
when
i
was
the
queen
i
stepped
over
silver
and
gold
i
shall
have
now
to
atone
for
the
evil
fortune
of
my
birth
by
walking
over
dust
and
bare
earth
i
could
not
have
dreamed
that
thus
i
would
meet
my
king
of
common
earth
and
dust
at
every
step
of
mine
surangama
look
my
queen
there
on
the
eastern
horizon
comes
the
dawn
we
have
not
long
to
walk
i
see
the
spires
of
the
golden
turrets
of
the
king
palace
enter
grandfather
grandfather
my
child
it
is
dawn
at
last
sudarshana
your
benedictions
have
given
me
godspeed
and
here
i
am
at
last
grandfather
but
do
you
see
how
our
king
is
he
has
sent
no
chariot
no
music
band
nothing
splendid
or
grand
sudarshana
nothing
grand
did
you
say
look
the
sky
is
rosy
and
crimson
from
end
to
end
the
air
is
full
of
the
welcome
of
the
scent
of
flowers
grandfather
yes
but
however
cruel
our
king
may
be
we
can
not
seek
to
emulate
him
i
can
not
help
feeling
pain
at
seeing
you
in
this
state
my
child
how
can
we
bear
to
see
you
going
to
the
king
palace
attired
in
this
poor
and
wretched
attire
wait
a
little
i
am
running
to
fetch
you
your
queen
garments
sudarshana
oh
no
no
no
he
has
taken
away
those
regal
robes
from
me
for
ever
he
has
attired
me
in
a
servant
dress
before
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
what
a
relief
this
has
been
to
me
i
am
his
servant
now
no
longer
his
queen
i
stand
at
the
feet
of
all
those
who
can
claim
any
relationship
with
him
grandfather
but
your
enemies
will
laugh
at
you
now
how
can
you
bear
their
derision
sudarshana
let
their
laughter
and
derision
be
immortal
let
them
throw
dust
at
me
in
the
streets
this
dust
will
be
the
powder
with
which
i
shall
deck
myself
before
meeting
my
lord
grandfather
after
this
we
shall
say
nothing
now
let
us
play
the
last
game
of
our
spring
festival
instead
of
the
pollen
of
flowers
let
the
south
breeze
blow
and
scatter
dust
of
lowliness
in
every
direction
we
shall
go
to
the
lord
clad
in
the
common
grey
of
the
dust
and
we
shall
find
him
too
covered
with
dust
all
over
for
do
you
think
the
people
spare
him
even
he
can
not
escape
from
their
soiled
and
dusty
hands
and
he
does
not
even
care
to
brush
the
dirt
off
his
garments
kanchi
grandfather
do
not
forget
me
in
this
game
of
yours
i
also
will
have
to
get
this
royal
garment
of
mine
soiled
till
it
is
beyond
all
recognition
grandfather
that
will
not
take
long
my
brother
now
that
you
have
come
down
so
far
you
will
change
your
colour
in
no
time
just
look
at
our
queen
she
got
into
a
temper
with
herself
and
thought
that
she
could
spoil
her
matchless
beauty
by
flinging
away
all
her
ornaments
but
this
insult
to
her
beauty
has
made
it
shine
forth
in
tenfold
radiance
and
now
it
is
in
its
unadorned
perfection
we
hear
that
our
king
is
all
innocent
of
beauty
that
is
why
he
loves
all
his
manifold
beauty
of
form
which
shines
as
the
very
ornament
of
his
breast
and
that
beauty
has
taken
off
its
veil
and
cloak
of
pride
and
vanity
what
could
i
not
give
to
be
allowed
to
hear
the
wonderful
music
and
song
that
has
filled
my
king
palace
surangama
lo
there
rises
the
sun
xx
the
dark
chamber
sudarshana
lord
do
not
give
me
back
the
honour
which
you
once
did
turn
away
from
me
i
am
the
servant
of
your
feet
i
only
seek
the
privilege
of
serving
you
king
will
you
be
able
to
bear
me
now
sudarshana
oh
yes
yes
i
shall
your
sigh
repelled
me
because
i
had
sought
to
find
you
in
the
pleasure
garden
in
my
chambers
there
even
your
meanest
servant
looks
handsomer
than
you
that
fever
of
longing
has
left
my
eyes
for
ever
you
are
not
beautiful
my
lord
you
stand
beyond
all
comparisons
king
that
which
can
be
comparable
with
me
lies
within
yourself
sudarshana
if
this
be
so
then
that
too
is
beyond
comparison
your
love
lives
in
me
you
are
mirrored
in
that
love
and
you
see
your
face
reflected
in
me
nothing
of
this
mine
it
is
all
yours
o
lord
king
i
open
the
doors
of
this
dark
room
the
game
is
finished
here
come
come
with
me
now
come
outside
i
into
the
light
sudarshana
before
i
go
let
me
bow
at
the
feet
of
my
lord
of
darkness

cruel

terrible

peerless
