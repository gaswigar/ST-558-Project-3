caudle
has
lent
five
pounds
to
a
friend
you
ought
to
be
very
rich
caudle
i
wonder
who
lend
you
five
pounds
but
so
it
is
a
wife
may
work
and
may
slave
ha
dear
the
many
things
that
might
have
been
done
with
five
pounds
as
if
people
picked
up
money
in
the
street
but
you
always
were
a
fool
caudle
i
wanted
a
black
satin
gown
these
three
years
and
that
five
pounds
would
have
pretty
well
bought
it
but
it
no
matter
how
i
go
not
at
all
every
body
says
i
do
dress
as
becomes
your
wife
and
i
do
but
what
that
to
you
caudle
nothing
oh
no
you
can
have
fine
feelings
for
everybody
but
those
belonging
to
you
i
wish
people
knew
you
as
i
do
that
all
you
like
to
be
called
liberal
and
your
poor
family
pays
for
it
all
the
girls
want
bonnets
and
when
they
to
get
i
ca
tell
half
five
pounds
would
have
bought
but
now
they
must
go
without
of
course
belong
to
you
and
anybody
but
your
own
flesh
and
blood
caudle
the
man
called
for
the
but
i
should
like
to
know
how
people
are
to
pay
taxes
who
throw
away
five
pounds
to
every
fellow
that
asks
them
perhaps
you
do
know
that
jack
this
morning
knocked
his
through
his
window
i
was
going
to
send
for
the
glazier
to
mend
it
but
after
you
lent
that
five
pounds
i
was
sure
we
could
afford
it
oh
no
the
window
must
go
as
it
is
and
pretty
weather
for
a
dear
child
to
sleep
with
a
broken
window
he
got
a
cold
already
on
his
lungs
and
i
should
at
all
wonder
if
that
broken
window
settled
him
if
the
dear
boy
dies
his
death
will
be
upon
his
father
head
for
i
sure
we
ca
now
pay
to
mend
windows
we
might
though
and
do
a
good
many
more
things
if
people
did
throw
away
their
five
pounds
next
tuesday
the
is
due
i
should
like
to
know
how
to
be
paid
why
it
ca
be
paid
at
all
that
five
pounds
would
have
just
done
it
and
now
insurance
is
out
of
the
question
and
there
never
were
so
many
fires
as
there
are
now
i
shall
never
close
my
eyes
all
night
but
what
that
to
you
so
people
can
call
you
liberal
caudle
your
wife
and
children
may
all
be
burnt
alive
in
their
beds
as
all
of
us
to
a
certainty
shall
be
for
the
insurance
drop
and
after
we
insured
for
so
many
years
but
how
i
should
like
to
know
are
people
to
insure
who
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
their
five
pounds
i
did
think
we
might
go
to
margate
this
summer
there
poor
little
caroline
i
sure
she
wants
the
sea
but
no
dear
creature
she
must
stop
at
home
all
of
us
must
stop
at
home
she
go
into
a
consumption
there
no
doubt
of
that
yes
sweet
little
angel
i
made
up
my
mind
to
lose
her
the
child
might
have
been
saved
but
people
save
their
children
and
throw
away
their
five
pounds
too
i
wonder
where
poor
little
cherub
is
while
you
were
lending
that
five
pounds
the
dog
ran
out
of
the
shop
you
know
i
never
let
it
go
into
the
street
for
fear
it
should
be
bit
by
some
mad
dog
and
come
home
and
bite
all
the
children
it
would
now
at
all
astonish
me
if
the
animal
was
to
come
back
with
the
hydrophobia
and
give
it
to
all
the
family
however
what
your
family
to
you
so
you
can
play
the
liberal
creature
with
five
pounds
do
you
hear
that
shutter
how
it
banging
to
and
fro
yes
i
know
what
it
wants
as
well
as
you
it
wants
a
new
fastening
i
was
going
to
send
for
the
blacksmith
but
now
it
out
of
the
question
it
must
bang
of
nights
since
you
thrown
away
five
pounds
well
things
are
come
to
a
pretty
pass
this
is
the
first
night
i
ever
made
my
supper
off
roast
beef
without
pickles
but
who
is
to
afford
pickles
when
folks
are
always
lending
five
pounds
ha
there
the
soot
falling
down
the
chimney
if
i
hate
the
smell
of
anything
it
the
smell
of
soot
and
you
know
it
but
what
are
my
feelings
to
you
sweep
the
chimney
yes
it
all
very
fine
to
say
sweep
the
chimney
but
how
are
chimneys
to
be
swept
how
are
they
to
be
paid
for
by
people
who
do
take
care
of
their
five
pounds
do
you
hear
the
mice
running
about
the
room
hear
them
if
they
were
only
to
drag
you
out
of
bed
it
would
be
no
matter
set
a
trap
for
them
yes
it
easy
enough
to
say
set
a
trap
for
but
how
are
people
to
afford
the
cheese
when
every
day
they
lose
five
pounds
hark
i
sure
there
a
noise
down
stairs
it
would
at
all
surprise
me
if
there
were
thieves
in
the
house
well
it
be
the
cat
but
thieves
are
pretty
sure
to
come
in
some
night
there
a
wretched
fastening
to
the
but
these
are
not
times
to
afford
bolts
and
bars
when
fools
wont
take
care
of
their
five
pounds
mary
anne
ought
to
have
gone
to
the
dentist
she
wants
three
teeth
taken
out
now
it
ca
be
done
three
teeth
that
quite
disfigure
the
child
mouth
but
there
they
must
stop
and
spoil
the
sweetest
face
that
was
ever
made
otherwise
she
have
been
a
wife
for
a
lord
now
when
she
grows
up
who
have
her
nobody
we
shall
die
and
leave
her
alone
and
unprotected
in
the
world
but
what
do
you
care
for
that
nothing
so
you
can
squander
away
five
pounds
and
now
see
caudle
what
a
misery
you
brought
upon
your
wretched
family
i
ca
have
a
satin
gown
the
girls
ca
have
new
bonnets
the
must
stand
over
jack
must
get
his
death
through
a
broken
window
our
ca
be
paid
so
we
shall
all
fall
victims
to
the
devouring
element
we
ca
go
to
margate
and
caroline
will
go
to
an
early
grave
the
dog
will
come
home
and
bite
us
all
mad
that
shutter
will
go
banging
for
ever
the
soot
will
always
fall
the
mice
never
let
us
have
a
wink
of
sleep
thieves
be
always
breaking
in
the
house
and
our
dear
mary
anne
be
for
ever
left
an
unprotected
maid

all
all
caudle
because
will
go
on
lending
five
pounds

at
a
tavern

they

to
bear
a
wife

stay
at
home
and
be
a
drudge
whilst

go
anywhere
it
enough
for
a

sit
like
cinderella
by
the
ashes

her
husband
can
go
drinking
and
singing
at
a
tavern

and
putting

and
bringing
all
sorts
of
disgrace
and
expense
upon

and
then
you
be
getting

a
street
fight

your
temper
too
well

for
the
dear
children

might
be
ruined

would
so
much
as

out
of
his
dear
pockets
ha
what
that
poor
creature
has
to
bear
and
had
got
at
the
brandy
a
pretty
thing
for
a
wife
to
wake
at
six
in
the
morning
and
instead
of
her
husband
to

his
dirty
boots
but

to
a
decent

skylarks
indeed
a
pretty
skylark

of
yourself
but
i
wo
stay

determined
of
that
i
go
and
take
the
dear
children
and

may
get
who
you
like
to
keep
your
house
that
is
as
long
as
you
have
a
house
to
keep
and
that
wo
be
long
know
how
any
decent
man
can
go
and
spend
his
nights
in
a
tavern
oh
yes
caudle
i
dare
say
you
go
for
rational
conversation
i
should
like
to
know
how
many
of
you
would
care
for
what
you
call
rational
conversation
if
you
had
it
without
your
filthy
yes
and
your
more
filthy
i
sure
the
last
time
you
came
home
i
had
the
for
a
week
but
i
know
who
it
is
who
taking
you
to
destruction
it
that
brute
prettyman
he
has
broken
his
own
poor
wife
heart
and
now
he
wants
to
but
do
you
think
it
caudle
i
not
have
my
peace
of
mind
destroyed
by
the
best
man
that
ever
trod
oh
yes
i
know
you
do
care
so
long
as
you
can
appear
well
to
all
the
world
but
the
world
little
thinks
how
you
behave
to
me
it
shall
know
it
though
that
i
determined
how
any
man
can
leave
his
own
happy
fireside
to
go
and
sit
and
smoke
and
drink
and
talk
with
people
who
would
one
of
lift
a
finger
to
save
him
from
hanging
how
any
man
can
leave
his
wife
and
a
good
wife
too
though
i
say
it
for
a
parcel
of
oh
disgraceful
caudle
it
unfeeling
no
man
who
had
the
least
love
for
his
wife
could
do
it
and
i
suppose
this
is
to
be
the
case
every
saturday
but
i
know
what
i
do
i
know
it
no
use
caudle
your
calling
me
a
good
creature
i
not
such
a
fool
as
to
be
coaxed
in
that
way
no
if
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
you
should
come
home
in
christian
time
not
at
halfpast
twelve
there
was
a
time
when
you
were
as
regular
at
your
fireside
as
the
kettle
that
was
when
you
were
a
decent
man
and
go
amongst
heaven
knows
who
drinking
and
smoking
and
making
what
you
think
your
jokes
i
never
heard
any
good
come
to
a
man
who
cared
about
jokes
no
respectable
tradesman
does
but
i
know
what
i
do
scare
away
your
skylarks
the
house
serves
liquor
after
twelve
of
a
saturday
and
if
i
do
write
to
the
magistrates
and
have
the
license
taken
away
i
not
lying
in
this
bed
this
night
yes
you
may
call
me
a
foolish
woman
but
no
caudle
no
it
you
who
are
the
foolish
man
or
worse
than
a
foolish
man
you
a
wicked
one
if
you
were
to
die
and
people
who
go
to
do
all
they
can
to
shorten
their
lives
i
should
like
to
know
who
would
write
upon
your
tombstone
tender
husband
and
an
affectionate
father
i
i
have
no
such
falsehoods
told
of
you
i
can
assure
you
going
and
spending
your
money
and
nonsense
do
tell
me
no
if
you
were
to
ten
times
swear
it
i
would
believe
that
you
only
spent
on
a
saturday
you
ca
be
all
those
hours
and
only
spend
i
know
better
i
not
quite
a
fool
caudle
a
great
deal
you
could
have
for
and
all
the
club
married
men
and
fathers
of
families
the
more
shame
for
skylarks
indeed
they
should
call
themselves
vultures
for
they
can
only
do
as
they
do
by
robbing
their
innocent
wives
and
children
a
week
and
if
it
was
only
that
do
you
know
what
come
to
in
a
year
do
you
ever
think
of
that
and
see
the
gowns
i
wear
i
sure
i
ca
out
of
the
buy
myself
a
pincushion
though
wanted
one
these
six
months
no
not
so
much
as
a
ball
of
but
what
do
you
care
so
you
can
get
your
there
the
girls
top
the
things
they
want
they
are
never
dressed
like
other
people
children
but
it
all
the
same
to
their
father
oh
yes
so
he
can
go
with
his
skylarks
they
may
wear
sackcloth
for
pinafores
and
packthread
for
garters
you
better
not
let
that
prettyman
come
here
that
all
or
rather
you
better
bring
him
once
yes
i
should
like
to
see
him
he
would
forget
it
a
man
who
i
may
say
lives
and
moves
only
in
a
spittoon
a
man
who
has
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
as
constant
as
his
front
teeth
a
sort
of
tavern
king
with
a
lot
of
fools
like
you
to
laugh
at
what
lie
thinks
his
jokes
and
give
him
consequence
no
caudle
no
it
no
use
your
telling
me
to
go
to
sleep
for
i
wo
go
to
sleep
indeed
i
sure
it
almost
time
to
get
up
i
hardly
know
what
the
use
of
coming
to
bed
at
all
now
the
skylarks
indeed
i
suppose
you
be
buying
a
warbler
and
at
your
time
of
life
be
trying
to
sing
the
peacocks
will
sing
next
a
pretty
name
you
get
in
the
neighbourhood
and
in
a
very
little
time
a
nice
face
you
have
your
nose
is
getting
redder
already
and
you
just
one
of
the
noses
that
liquor
always
flies
to
you
do
see
it
red
no
i
dare
say
not
but
i
see
it
i
see
a
great
many
do
and
so
you
go
on
in
a
little
time
with
your
do
tell
me
that
you
only
take
two
small
glasses
i
know
what
men
two
small
glasses
are
in
a
little
time
you
have
a
face
all
over
as
if
it
was
made
of
red
currant
jam
and
i
should
like
to
know
who
to
endure
you
then
i
wo
and
so
do
think
it
come
to
me
nice
habits
men
learn
at
clubs
there
joskins
he
was
a
decent
creature
once
and
now
i
told
he
has
more
than
once
boxed
his
ears
he
a
skylark
too
and
i
suppose
some
day
you
be
trying
to
box
ears
do
attempt
it
caudle
i
say
do
attempt
it
yes
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
you
do
mean
it
but
i
only
say
again
do
attempt
it
you
rue
it
till
the
day
of
your
death
caudle
going
and
sitting
for
four
hours
at
a
tavern
what
men
unless
they
had
their
wives
with
them
can
find
to
talk
about
i
ca
think
no
good
of
course
a
week
and
drinking
enough
to
swim
a
boat
and
smoking
like
the
funnel
of
a
and
i
afford
myself
so
much
as
a
piece
of
tape
it
brutal
caudle
ry
bru
and
says
a
note
in
the
by
caudle
here
thank
heaven
yawning
she
fell
lecture
iv
caudle
has
been
called
from
his
bed
to
bail
prettyman
from
the
ie
caudle
i
knew
it
would
come
to
this
i
said
it
would
when
you
joined
those
precious
skylarks
people
being
called
out
of
their
beds
at
all
hours
of
the
night
to
bail
a
set
of
fellows
who
are
never
so
happy
as
when
they
leading
sober
men
to
destruction
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
neighbours
will
think
of
you
with
people
from
the
police
knocking
at
the
door
at
two
in
the
morning
do
tell
me
that
the
man
has
been
he
not
the
man
to
be
and
you
must
go
and
bail
him
i
know
the
end
of
that
he
run
away
and
you
have
to
pay
the
money
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
use
of
my
working
and
slaving
to
save
a
farthing
when
you
throw
away
pounds
upon
your
precious
skylarks
a
pretty
cold
you
have
morning
being
called
out
of
your
warm
bed
this
weather
but
do
you
think
i
nurse
you
not
i
not
a
drop
of
gruel
do
you
get
from
me
i
sure
you
plenty
of
ways
of
spending
your
money
not
throwing
it
away
upon
a
set
of
dissolute
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
you
have
thrown
away
your
money
but
you
will
he
be
certain
to
run
off
it
is
likely
he
go
upon
his
trial
and
you
be
fixed
with
the
bail
do
tell
me
there
no
trial
in
the
matter
because
i
know
there
is
it
for
something
more
than
quarrelling
with
the
policeman
that
he
was
locked
up
people
ai
locked
up
for
that
no
it
for
robbery
or
something
worse
perhaps
and
as
you
bailed
him
people
will
think
you
are
as
bad
as
he
is
do
tell
me
you
could
help
bailing
him
you
should
have
shown
yourself
a
respectable
man
and
have
let
him
been
sent
to
prison
now
people
know
you
the
friend
of
drunken
and
other
disorderly
persons
you
never
have
a
night
sleep
in
your
bed
not
that
it
would
matter
what
fell
upon
you
if
it
was
your
poor
wife
who
suffered
of
course
all
the
business
will
be
in
the
newspapers
and
your
name
with
it
i
should
wonder
too
if
they
give
your
picture
as
they
do
the
other
folks
of
the
old
bailey
a
pretty
thing
that
to
go
down
to
your
children
i
sure
it
will
be
enough
to
make
them
change
their
name
no
i
shall
not
go
to
sleep
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
go
to
sleep
after
such
a
disturbance
i
shall
not
go
but
here
says
caudle
manuscript
happily
she
slumbered
for
caudle
had
considering
the
theme
she
had
to
talk
upon
a
remarkably
short
lecture
lecture
caudle
has
remained
down
stairs
till
past
one
with
a
friend
illustration
pretty
time
of
night
to
come
to
bed
caudle
ugh
as
cold
too
as
any
ice
enough
to
give
any
woman
her
death
i
sure
what
i
have
locked
up
the
coals
indeed
if
i
had
i
no
doubt
the
fellow
would
have
staid
all
night
it
all
very
well
for
you
caudle
to
bring
people
home
but
i
wish
you
think
first
what
for
supper
that
beautiful
leg
of
pork
would
have
served
for
our
dinner
and
now
it
gone
ca
keep
the
house
upon
the
money
and
i
wo
pretend
to
do
it
if
you
bring
a
mob
of
people
every
night
to
clear
the
cupboard
i
wonder
who
be
so
ready
to
give
you
a
supper
when
you
want
one
for
want
one
you
will
unless
you
change
your
plans
do
tell
me
i
know
i
right
you
first
be
eaten
up
and
then
you
be
laughed
at
i
know
the
world
no
indeed
caudle
i
do
think
ill
of
everybody
do
say
that
but
i
ca
see
a
leg
of
pork
eaten
up
in
that
way
without
asking
myself
what
it
all
to
end
in
if
such
things
go
on
and
then
he
must
have
pickles
too
could
be
content
with
my
cabbage
no
caudle
i
wo
let
you
go
to
sleep
it
very
well
for
you
to
say
let
you
go
to
sleep
after
you
kept
me
awake
till
this
time
did
i
keep
awake
how
do
you
suppose
i
could
go
to
sleep
when
i
knew
that
man
was
below
drinking
up
your
substance
in
for
he
could
be
content
upon
decent
wholesome
gin
upon
my
word
you
ought
to
be
a
rich
man
caudle
you
have
such
very
fine
friends
i
wonder
who
gives
you
brandy
when
you
go
out
no
indeed
he
could
be
content
with
my
pickled
cabbage
and
i
should
like
to
know
who
makes
better
but
he
must
have
walnuts
and
you
too
like
a
fool
now
do
you
think
to
stop
me
caudle
a
poor
woman
may
be
trampled
to
death
and
never
say
a
word
you
too
like
a
fool
i
wonder
who
do
it
for
you
to
insist
upon
the
girl
going
out
for
pickled
walnuts
and
in
such
a
night
too
with
snow
upon
the
ground
yes
you
a
man
of
fine
feelings
you
are
caudle
but
the
world
does
know
you
as
i
know
you
fine
feelings
indeed
to
send
the
poor
girl
out
when
i
told
you
and
told
your
friend
too
a
pretty
brute
he
is
i
sure
that
the
poor
girl
had
got
a
cold
and
chilblains
on
her
toes
but
i
know
what
will
be
the
end
of
that
she
be
laid
up
and
we
shall
have
a
nice
doctor
bill
and
you
pay
it
i
can
tell
you
for
wont
wish
you
were
out
of
the
world
oh
yes
that
all
very
easy
i
sure
might
wish
it
do
swear
in
that
dreadful
way
ai
you
afraid
that
the
bed
will
open
and
swallow
you
and
do
swing
about
in
that
way
will
do
no
good
wo
bring
back
the
leg
of
pork
and
the
brandy
poured
down
both
of
your
throats
oh
i
know
it
i
sure
of
it
i
only
recollected
it
when
i
got
into
bed
and
if
it
had
been
so
cold
you
have
seen
me
down
stairs
again
i
can
tell
you
i
recollected
it
and
a
pretty
two
hours
i
passed
that
i
left
the
key
in
the
cupboard
and
i
knew
it
i
could
see
by
the
manner
of
you
when
you
came
into
the
room
i
know
you
got
the
other
bottle
however
there
one
comfort
you
told
me
to
send
for
the
best
brandy
the
very
best
for
your
other
friend
who
called
last
wednesday
ha
ha
it
was
british
the
cheapest
british
and
nice
and
ill
i
hope
the
pair
of
you
will
be
tomorrow
there
only
the
bare
bone
of
the
leg
of
pork
but
you
get
nothing
else
for
dinner
i
can
tell
you
it
a
dreadful
thing
that
the
poor
children
should
go
without
but
if
they
have
such
a
father
they
poor
things
must
suffer
for
it
nearly
a
whole
leg
of
pork
and
a
pint
of
brandy
a
pint
of
brandy
and
a
leg
of
pork
a
leg
of
leg
and
mumbling
the
syllables
says
caudle
she
went
to
sleep
lecture
vi
caudle
has
lent
an
acquaintance
the
family
umbrella
caudle
lectures
thereon
bah
that
the
third
umbrella
gone
since
christmas
what
were
you
to
do
why
let
him
go
home
in
the
rain
to
be
sure
i
very
certain
there
was
nothing
about
that
could
spoil
take
cold
indeed
he
look
like
one
of
the
sort
to
take
cold
besides
he
have
better
taken
cold
than
take
our
only
umbrella
do
you
hear
the
rain
caudle
i
say
do
you
hear
the
rain
and
as
i
alive
if
it
is
saint
day
do
you
hear
it
against
the
windows
nonsense
you
do
impose
upon
me
you
ca
be
asleep
with
such
a
shower
as
that
do
you
hear
it
i
say
oh
you
hear
it
well
that
a
pretty
flood
i
think
to
last
for
six
weeks
and
no
stirring
all
the
time
out
of
the
house
pooh
do
think
me
a
fool

hear
it
worse
and
worse
cats
and
dogs

should
like
to
know
how
the
children
are
to
get
to

they
sha
go
through
such
weather
i
determined
no
they
shall
stop
at
home
and
never
learn
anything
the
blessed
creatures
sooner
than
go
and
get
wet
and
when
they
grow
up
i
wonder
who
they
have
to
thank
for
knowing
nothing
who
indeed
but
their
father
people
who
feel
for
their
own
children
ought
never
to
be
fathers
but
i
know
why
you
lent
the
umbrella
oh

know
very
well

was
going
out
to
tea
at
dear
mother

did
it
on
purpose
do
tell
me

mean
advantage

should
like
to
know
who
to
pay
for

i
sure

if

on
as

always
does
but

without
the
umbrella
you
may
lose
the
debt
for
what
i
care
it
wo
be
so
much
as
spoiling
your
clothes
better
lose
it
people
deserve
to
lose
debts
who
lend
umbrellas
and
i
should
like
to
know
how
i
to
go
to
mother
without
the
umbrella
oh
do
tell
me
that
i
said
i
go
that

but
they

i
said
they
should
you
are
so
aggravating
caudle
spoil
the
temper
of
an
angel
they
go
to
school
mark
that
and
if
they
get
their
deaths
of
cold
it
not
my
fault
did
lend
the
here
says
caudle
in
his
ms
i
fell
asleep
and
dreamt
that
the
sky
was
turned
into
green
calico
with
whalebone
ribs
that
in
fact
the
whole
world
revolved
under
a
tremendous
umbrella
lecture
vii
caudle
has
ventured
a
remonstrance
on
his
dinner
cold
mutton
and
no
pudding
caudle
defends
the
cold
shoulder
illustration
i
wonder
what
it
will
be
next
there
nothing
proper
now
nothing
at
all
better
get
somebody
else
to
keep
the
house
i
think
i
ca
do
it
now
it
seems
i
only
in
the
way
here
i
better
take
the
children
and
go
what
am
i
grumbling
about
now
it
very
well
for
you
to
ask
that
sure
i
better
be
out
of
the
world
than
there
now
caudle
there
you
are
again
i
speak
sir
it
is
often
i
open
my
mouth
heaven
knows
but
you
like
to
hear
nobody
talk
but
yourself
you
ought
to
have
married
a
negro
slave
and
not
any
respectable
woman
you
to
go
about
the
house
looking
like
thunder
all
the
day
and
not
to
say
a
word
where
do
you
think
pudding
to
come
from
you
show
a
nice
example
to
your
children
you
do
complaining
and
turning
your
nose
up
at
a
sweet
piece
of
cold
mutton
because
no
pudding
you
go
a
nice
way
to
make
extravagant
teach
nice
lessons
to
begin
the
world
with
do
you
know
what
puddings
cost
or
do
you
think
they
fly
in
at
the
window
you
hate
cold
mutton
the
more
shame
for
you
caudle
i
sure
you
the
stomach
of
a
lord
you
have
no
sir
i
did
choose
to
hash
the
mutton
it
very
easy
for
you
to
say
hash
it
but
know
what
a
joint
loses
in
hashing
it
a
day
dinner
the
less
if
it
a
bit
yes
i
dare
say
other
people
may
have
puddings
with
cold
mutton
no
doubt
of
it
and
other
people
become
bankrupts
but
if
ever
you
get
into
the
gazette
it
sha
be
fault
no
i
do
my
duty
as
a
wife
to
you
caudle
you
shall
never
have
it
to
say
that
it
was
housekeeping
that
brought
you
to
beggary
no
you
may
sulk
at
the
cold
meat
ha
i
hope
you
never
live
to
want
such
a
piece
of
cold
mutton
as
we
had
and
you
may
threaten
to
go
to
a
tavern
to
dine
but
with
our
present
means
not
a
crumb
of
pudding
do
you
get
from
me
you
shall
have
nothing
but
the
cold
joint
nothing
as
i
a
christian
sinner
yes
there
you
are
throwing
those
fowls
in
my
face
again
i
know
you
once
brought
home
a
pair
of
fowls
i
know
it
and
wer
you
mean
enough
to
want
to
stop
out
of
my
week
money
oh
the
selfishness
the
shabbiness
of
men
they
can
go
out
and
throw
away
pounds
upon
pounds
with
a
pack
of
people
who
laugh
at
afterwards
but
if
it
anything
wanted
for
their
own
homes
their
poor
wives
may
hunt
for
it
i
wonder
you
do
blush
to
name
those
fowls
again
i
would
be
so
little
for
the
world
caudle
what
are
you
going
to
do
going
to
get
up
do
make
yourself
ridiculous
caudle
i
ca
say
a
word
to
you
like
any
other
wife
but
you
must
threaten
to
get
up
be
ashamed
of
yourself
puddings
indeed
do
you
think
i
made
of
puddings
did
you
have
some
boiled
rice
three
weeks
ago
besides
is
this
the
time
of
the
year
for
puddings
it
all
very
well
if
i
had
money
enough
allowed
me
like
any
other
wife
to
keep
the
house
with
then
indeed
i
might
have
preserves
like
any
other
woman
now
it
impossible
and
cruel
yes
caudle
cruel
of
you
to
expect
it
apples
ar
so
dear
ar
they
i
know
what
apples
are
caudle
without
your
telling
me
but
i
suppose
you
want
something
more
than
apples
for
dumplings
i
suppose
sugar
costs
something
does
it
and
that
how
it
is
that
how
one
expense
brings
on
another
and
how
people
go
to
ruin
pancakes
what
the
use
of
your
lying
muttering
there
about
pancakes
do
you
always
have
once
every
shrove
tuesday
and
what
would
any
moderate
decent
man
want
more
pancakes
indeed
pray
caudle
no
it
no
use
your
saying
fine
words
to
me
to
let
you
go
to
sleep
i
sha
pray
do
you
know
the
price
of
eggs
just
now
there
not
an
egg
you
can
trust
to
under
seven
and
eight
a
shilling
well
you
only
just
to
reckon
up
how
many
eggs
do
lie
swearing
there
at
the
eggs
in
that
manner
caudle
unless
you
expect
the
bed
to
open
under
you
you
call
yourself
a
respectable
tradesman
i
suppose
ha
i
only
wish
people
knew
you
as
well
as
i
do
swearing
at
eggs
indeed
but
i
tired
of
this
usage
caudle
quite
tired
of
it
and
i
do
care
how
soon
it
ended
i
sure
i
do
nothing
but
work
and
labour
and
think
how
to
make
the
most
of
everything
and
this
is
how
i
rewarded
i
should
like
to
see
anybody
whose
joints
go
further
than
mine
but
if
i
was
to
throw
away
your
money
into
the
street
or
lay
it
out
in
fine
feathers
on
myself
i
should
be
better
thought
of
the
woman
who
studies
her
husband
and
her
family
is
always
made
a
drudge
of
it
your
fine
wives
the
best
time
of
it
what
the
use
of
your
lying
groaning
there
in
that
manner
that
make
me
hold
my
tongue
i
can
tell
you
you
think
to
have
it
all
your
own
way
but
you
wo
caudle
you
can
insult
my
dinner
look
like
a
demon
i
may
say
at
a
wholesome
piece
of
cold
mutton
ha
the
thousands
of
far
better
creatures
than
you
are
who
been
thankful
for
that
mutton
and
i
never
to
speak
but
you
mistaken
i
will
your
usage
of
me
caudle
is
infamous
unworthy
of
a
man
i
only
wish
people
knew
you
for
what
you
are
but
they
shall
some
day
puddings
and
now
i
suppose
i
shall
hear
of
nothing
but
puddings
yes
and
i
know
what
it
would
end
in
first
you
have
a
pudding
every
day
oh
i
know
your
extravagance
then
you
go
for
fish
then
i
should
wonder
if
you
have
soup
turtle
no
doubt
then
you
go
for
a
dessert
and
oh
i
see
it
all
as
plain
as
the
quilt
before
me
but
no
not
while
i
live
what
your
second
wife
may
do
i
do
know
perhaps
she
be
a
fine
lady
but
you
sha
be
ruined
by
me
caudle
that
i
determined
puddings
indeed
pudd
exhausted
nature
says
caudle
could
hold
no
longer
here
my
wife
went
to
lecture
viii
caudle
has
been
made
a
mrs
caudle
indignant
and
curious
now
caudle
caudle
i
say
oh
you
ca
be
asleep
already
i
know
now
what
i
mean
to
say
is
this
there
no
use
none
at
all
in
our
having
any
disturbance
about
the
matter
but
at
last
my
mind
made
up
caudle
i
shall
leave
you
either
i
know
all
you
been
doing
or
morning
i
quit
the
house
no
no
there
an
end
of
the
i
think
an
end
of
all
confidence
between
man
and
wife
if
a
husband
to
have
secrets
and
keep
all
to
himself
pretty
secrets
they
must
be
when
his
own
wife
ca
know
not
fit
for
any
decent
person
to
know
i
sure
if
that
the
case
now
caudle
let
us
quarrel
there
a
good
soul
tell
me
what
it
all
about
a
pack
of
nonsense
i
dare
say
still
not
that
i
care
much
about
it
still
i
like
to
know
there
a
dear
eh
oh
do
tell
me
nothing
in
it
i
know
better
i
not
a
fool
caudle
i
know
a
good
deal
in
it
now
caudle
just
tell
me
a
little
bit
of
it
sure
i
tell
you
anything
you
know
i
would
well
caudle
you
enough
to
vex
a
saint
now
do
you
think
you
going
to
sleep
because
you
not
do
you
suppose
i
ever
suffered
you
to
go
and
be
made
a
mason
if
i
did
suppose
i
was
to
know
the
secret
too
not
that
it
anything
to
know
i
dare
say
and
that
s
why
determined
to
know
it
but
i
know
what
it
is
oh
yes
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
secret
is
to
poor
women
to
tyrannize
over
to
make
your
slaves
especially
your
wives
it
must
be
something
of
the
sort
or
you
be
ashamed
to
have
it
known
what
right
and
proper
never
need
be
done
in
secret
it
an
insult
to
a
woman
for
a
man
to
be
a
and
let
his
wife
know
nothing
of
it
but
poor
soul
she
sure
to
know
it
somehow
for
nice
husbands
they
all
make
yes
yes
a
part
of
the
secret
is
to
think
better
of
all
the
world
than
their
own
wives
and
families
i
sure
men
have
quite
enough
to
care
for
that
is
if
they
act
properly
to
care
for
them
they
have
at
home
they
ca
have
much
care
to
spare
for
the
world
besides
and
i
suppose
they
call
you
caudle
a
pretty
brother
indeed
going
and
dressing
yourself
up
in
an
apron
like
a
turnpike
man
for
that
what
you
look
like
and
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
for
there
must
be
something
in
it
not
very
respectable
i
sure
well
i
only
wish
i
was
queen
for
a
day
or
two
i
put
an
end
to
and
all
such
trumpery
i
know
now
come
caudle
do
let
quarrel
eh
you
not
in
pain
dear
what
it
all
about
what
are
you
lying
laughing
there
at
but
i
a
fool
to
trouble
my
head
about
you
and
you
not
going
to
let
me
know
the
secret
eh
you
mean
to
say
you
not
now
caudle
you
know
it
a
hard
matter
to
put
me
in
a
passion
not
that
i
care
about
the
secret
itself
no
i
give
a
button
to
know
it
for
it
all
nonsense
i
sure
it
the
secret
i
care
about
it
the
slight
caudle
it
the
studied
insult
that
a
man
pays
to
his
wife
when
he
thinks
of
going
through
the
world
keeping
something
to
himself
which
he
wo
let
her
know
man
and
wife
one
indeed
i
should
like
to
know
how
that
can
be
when
a
man
a
mason
when
he
keeps
a
secret
that
sets
him
and
his
wife
apart
ha
you
men
make
the
laws
and
so
you
take
good
care
to
have
all
the
best
of
to
yourselves
otherwise
a
woman
ought
to
be
allowed
a
divorce
when
a
man
becomes
a
mason
when
he
got
a
sort
of
in
his
heart
a
secret
place
in
his
mind
that
his
poor
wife
is
allowed
to
rummage
caudle
you
sha
close
your
eyes
for
a
week
no
you
sha
unless
you
tell
me
some
of
it
come
there
a
good
creature
there
a
love
i
sure
caudle
i
would
refuse
you
anything
and
you
know
it
or
ought
to
know
it
by
this
time
i
only
wish
i
had
a
secret
to
whom
should
i
think
of
confiding
it
but
to
my
dear
husband
i
should
be
miserable
to
keep
it
to
myself
and
you
know
it
now
caudle
was
there
ever
such
a
man
a
man
indeed
a
brute
yes
caudle
an
unfeeling
brutal
creature
when
you
might
oblige
me
and
you
wo
sure
i
do
object
to
your
being
a
mason
not
at
all
caudle
i
dare
say
it
a
very
good
thing
i
dare
say
it
is
it
only
your
making
a
secret
of
it
that
vexes
me
but
you
tell
me
you
tell
your
own
margaret
you
wo
you
a
wretch
caudle
but
i
know

fact

you
ashamed
to
let
me

what
a
fool
they

making
of
you
that
it
you
at
your
time
of
life
the
father
of
a
family
i
should
be
ashamed
of
myself
caudle
and
i
suppose
you
be
going
to
what
you
call
your
lodge
every
night
now

pretty
place
it
must
be
where
they

dare
say
then
you
call
one
another
brethren
brethren
i
sure
you
relations
enough
you
did
want
any
more
but
i
know
what
all
this
masonry
about
it
only
an
excuse
to
get
away
from
your
wives
and
families
that
you
may
feast
and
drink
together
that
all
that
the
secret
and
to
abuse
women
as
if
they
were
inferior
animals

secret

used
to
worry

fret
myself
to
death
when

i
got
over
that
i
would
put
myself
out
of
the
way
now
for
the
best
man
that

what
thanks
does
a
poor
woman
get
none

all
no
it
those
who
do
care
for
their
families

are
the
best
thought
of

why
could
you
say
like
a
man
you
were
going

made
your
mind
up

no
doubt
i
should
like
to
have
been
behind

time
of
life
and
i
of
course
i
never
want

go
out

may
stay
at
home
with

cat
you

and
children

any
other
decent
man
to
a
fair

wife

with
you

anybody
but
those
belonging

know
what
you
are
when

foolish
woman

no
matter
sir
if
the
pink
bonnet
was
fifty
years
ago

all
the
same
for
that
no
and
if
i
live
for
fifty
years
to
come
i
never
will
leave
off
talking
of
it
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
caudle
ha
few
wives
would
have
been
what
i
been
to
you
i
only
wish
my
time
was
to
come
over
again
that
all
i
be
the
fool
i
have
been
going
to
a
fair
and
i
suppose
you
had
your
fortune
told
by
the
gypsies
you
need
have
wasted
your
money
i
sure
i
can
tell
you
your
fortune
if
you
go
on
as
you
do
yes
the
gaol
will
be
your
fortune
caudle
and
it
would
be
no
matter
none
at
all
if
your
wife
and
children
did
suffer
with
you
and
then
you
must
go
riding
upon
donkeys
you
did
go
riding
upon
donkeys
yes
it
very
well
for
you
to
say
so
but
i
dare
say
you
did
i
tell
you
caudle
i
know
what
you
are
when
you
out
i
trust
any
of
you
you
especially
caudle
then
you
must
go
in
the
thick
of
the
fair
and
have
the
girls
scratching
your
coat
with
rattles
you
could
help
it
if
they
did
scratch
your
coat
do
tell
me
people
do
scratch
coats
unless
they
encouraged
to
do
it
and
you
must
go
in
a
swing
too
you
go
in
a
swing
and
i
a
foolish
woman
to
think
so
am
i
well
if
you
did
it
was
no
fault
of
yours
you
wished
to
go
i
no
doubt
and
then
you
must
go
into
the
shows
there
you
do
deny
that
you
go
into
a
show
what
of
it
caudle
a
good
deal
of
it
sir
nice
crowding
and
squeezing
in
those
shows
i
know
pretty
places
and
you
a
married
man
and
the
father
of
a
family
no
i
wo
hold
my
tongue
it
very
well
for
you
to
threaten
to
get
up
you
to
go
to
greenwich
fair
and
race
up
and
down
the
hill
and
play
at
kiss
in
the
ring
pah
it
disgusting
caudle
oh
i
dare
say
you
play
at
it
if
you
did
you
have
liked
and
that
just
as
bad
and
you
can
go
into
swings
and
shows
and
roundabouts
if
i
was
you
i
should
hide
my
head
under
the
clothes
and
be
ashamed
of
myself
and
what
is
most
selfish
most
mean
of
you
caudle
you
can
go
and
enjoy
yourself
and
never
so
much
as
bring
home
for
the
poor
children
a
do
tell
me
that
your
pocket
was
picked
of
a
pound
of
nuts
nice
company
you
must
have
been
in
to
have
your
pocket
picked
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
hear
all
about
it
tomorrow
i
no
doubt
sir
you
were
dancing
at
the
i
should
like
to
have
seen
you
no
i
not
making
myself
ridiculous
it
you
that
making
yourself
ridiculous
and
everybody
that
knows
you
says
so
everybody
knows
what
i
have
to
put
up
with
from
you
going
to
a
fair
indeed
at
your
time
here
says
caudle
i
dozed
off
hearing
confusedly
the
words
hill
gypsies
rattles
roundabout
swings
pink
bonnet
lecture
x
on
caudle
there
caudle
i
hope
you
in
a
little
better
temper
than
you
were
this
morning
there
you
need
begin
to
whistle
people
come
to
bed
to
whistle
but
it
like
you
i
ca
speak
that
you
do
try
to
insult
me
once
i
used
to
say
you
were
the
best
creature
living
now
you
get
quite
a
fiend
let
you
rest
no
i
wo
let
you
rest
it
the
only
time
i
have
to
talk
to
you
and
you
hear
me
i
put
upon
all
day
long
it
very
hard
if
i
ca
speak
a
word
at
night
and
it
is
often
i
open
my
mouth
goodness
knows
because
in
your
lifetime
your
shirt
wanted
a
button
you
must
almost
swear
the
roof
off
the
house
you
swear
ha
caudle
you
do
know
what
you
do
when
you
in
a
passion
you
were
not
in
a
passion
you
well
then
i
do
know
what
a
passion
is
and
i
think
i
ought
by
this
time
i
lived
long
enough
with
you
caudle
to
know
that
it
a
pity
you
hav
something
worse
to
complain
of
than
a
button
off
your
shirt
if
you
wives
you
would
i
know
i
sure
i
never
without
a
in
my
hand
what
with
you
and
the
children
i
made
a
perfect
slave
of
and
what
my
thanks
why
if
once
in
your
life
a
button
off
your
shirt
what
do
you
cry
at
i
say
once
cau
dle
or
twice
or
three
times
at
most
i
sure
caudle
no
man
buttons
in
the
world
are
better
looked
after
than
your
i
only
wish
i
kept
the
shirts
you
had
when
you
were
first
married
i
should
like
to
know
where
were
your
buttons
then
yes
it
worth
talking
of
but
that
how
you
always
try
to
put
me
down
you
fly
into
a
rage
and
then
if
i
only
try
to
speak
you
hear
me
that
how
you
men
always
will
have
all
the
talk
to
yourselves
a
poor
woman
is
allowed
to
get
a
word
in
a
nice
notion
you
have
of
a
wife
to
suppose
she
nothing
to
think
of
but
her
husband
buttons
a
pretty
notion
indeed
you
have
of
marriage
ha
if
poor
women
only
knew
what
they
had
to
go
through
what
with
buttons
and
one
thing
and
another
they
never
tie
themselves
up
to
the
best
man
in
the
world
i
sure
what
would
they
do
caudle
why
do
much
better
without
you
i
certain
and
it
my
belief
after
all
that
the
button
was
off
the
shirt
it
my
belief
that
you
pulled
it
off
that
you
might
have
something
to
talk
about
oh
you
aggravating
enough
when
you
like
for
anything
all
i
know
is
it
very
odd
that
the
button
should
be
off
the
shirt
for
i
sure
no
woman
a
greater
slave
to
her
husband
buttons
than
i
am
i
only
say
it
very
odd
however
there
one
comfort
it
ca
last
long
i
worn
to
death
with
your
temper
and
trouble
you
a
great
while
ha
you
may
laugh
and
i
dare
say
you
would
laugh
i
no
doubt
of
it
that
your
love
that
your
feeling
i
know
that
i
sinking
every
day
though
i
say
nothing
about
it
and
when
i
gone
we
shall
see
how
your
second
wife
will
look
after
your
buttons
you
find
out
the
difference
then
yes
caudle
you
think
of
me
then
for
then
i
hope
you
never
have
a
blessed
button
to
your
back
no
i
not
a
vindictive
woman
caudle
nobody
ever
called
me
that
but
you
what
do
you
say
nobody
ever
knew
so
much
of
me
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
ha
i
would
have
your
aggravating
temper
caudle
for
mines
of
gold
it
a
good
thing
i
not
as
worrying
as
you
are
or
a
nice
house
there
be
between
us
i
only
wish
had
a
wife
that
have
talked
to
you
then
you
have
known
the
difference
but
you
impose
upon
me
because
like
a
poor
fool
i
say
nothing
i
should
be
ashamed
of
myself
caudle
and
a
pretty
example
you
set
as
a
father
you
make
your
boys
as
bad
as
yourself
talking
as
you
did
all
about
your
but
tons
and
of
a
sunday
morning
too
and
you
call
yourself
a
christian
i
should
like
to
know
what
your
boys
will
say
of
you
when
they
grow
up
and
all
about
a
paltry
button
off
one
of
your
wristbands
a
decent
man
have
mentioned
it
why
wo
i
hold
my
tongue
because
i
hold
my
tongue
i
to
have
my
peace
of
mind
destroyed
i
to
be
worried
into
my
grave
for
a
miserable
and
i
to
hold
my
tongue
oh
but
that
just
like
you
men
but
i
know
what
i
do
for
the
future
every
button
you
have
may
drop
off
and
i
wo
so
much
as
put
a
thread
to
and
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
do
then
oh
you
must
get
somebody
else
to
sew
must
you
that
a
pretty
threat
for
a
husband
to
hold
out
to
a
wife
and
to
such
a
wife
as
i
been
too
such
a
to
your
buttons
as
i
may
say
somebody
else
to
sew
eh
no
caudle
no
not
while
i
alive
when
i
dead
and
with
what
i
have
to
bear
there
no
knowing
how
soon
that
may
be
when
i
dead
i
say
oh
what
a
brute
you
must
be
to
snore
so
you
not
snoring
ha
that
what
you
always
say
but
that
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
must
get
somebody
else
to
sew
must
you
ha
i
should
wonder
oh
no
i
should
be
surprised
at
nothing
now
nothing
at
all
it
what
people
have
always
told
me
it
would
come
to
and
now
the
buttons
have
opened
my
eyes
but
the
whole
world
shall
know
of
your
cruelty
caudle
after
the
wife
i
been
to
you
somebody
else
indeed
to
sew
your
buttons
i
no
longer
to
be
mistress
in
my
own
house
ha
caudle
i
would
have
upon
my
conscience
what
you
have
for
the
world
i
would
treat
anybody
as
you
treat
no
i
not
mad
you
caudle
who
are
mad
or
bad
and
that
worse
i
ca
even
so
much
as
speak
of
a
but
that
i
threatened
to
be
made
nobody
of
in
my
own
house
caudle
you
a
heart
like
a
you
have
to
threaten
me
and
only
because
a
button
a
button
i
was
conscious
of
no
more
than
this
says
caudle
in
his
for
here
nature
relieved
me
with
a
sweet
deep
lecture
xi
caudle
suggests
that
her
dear
mother
should
come
and
live
with
illustration
is
your
cold
better
tonight
caudle
yes
i
thought
it
was
be
quite
well
i
dare
say
there
a
love
you
do
take
care
enough
of
yourself
caudle
you
do
and
you
ought
i
sure
if
only
for
my
sake
for
whatever
i
should
do
if
any
thing
was
to
happen
to
you
but
i
wo
think
of
it
no
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
still
you
ought
to
take
care
of
yourself
for
you
know
you
not
strong
caudle
you
know
you
not
was
dear
mother
so
happy
with

suddenly
i
say
was
she
so
happy

know
how
can
you
say

seen
it
but
she
always
is
happier
here

what
a
temper

dear
soul
has
i
call
it
a
temper
of
satin
it
is
so
smooth
so
easy
and
so
soft
nothing
puts
her
out
of
the
way
and
then
if

only
knew
how
she
takes
your
part

sure
if
you

her

times

be
fonder

with
us
you
could
have
every
day
now
do
fling
yourself
about
and
begin
to
swear
at
you
know
you
like
dear
what
a
hand
too
dear
mother
has
for
a
piecrust
but
it
born
with
some
people
what
do
you
say
was
it
born
with
me
now
caudle
that
cruel
unfeeling
of
you
i
would
have
uttered
such
a
reproach
to
you
for
the
whole
world
people
ca
be
born
as
they
like
how
often
too
have
you
wanted
to
brew
at
home
and
i
never
could
learn
any
thing
about
brewing
but
ha
what
ale
dear
mother
makes
never
tasted
it
no
i
know
that
but
i
recollect
the
ale
we
used
to
have
at
home
father
never
would
drink
wine
after
it
the
best
sherry
was
nothing
like
it
dare
say
not
no
it
was
indeed
caudle
then
if
dear
mother
was
only
with
us
what
money
we
should
save
in
beer
and
then
you
might
always
have
your
own
nice
pure
good
wholesome
ale
caudle
and
what
good
it
would
do
you
for
you
not
strong
caudle
and
then
dear
mother
jams
and
preserves
love
i
own
it
caudle
it
has
often
gone
to
my
heart
that
with
cold
meat
you
always
had
a
pudding
now
if
mother
was
with
us
in
the
matter
of
she
make
it
summer
all
the
year
round
but
i
never
could
preserve
now
mother
does
it
and
for
next
to
no
money
whatever
what
nice
she
make
for
the
children
oh
they
delicious
as
dear
mother
makes
now
you
tasted
her
irish
stew
caudle
you
remember
that
come
you
not
asleep
you
remember
that
and
how
fond
you
are
of
it
and
i
never
can
have
it
made
to
please
you
now
what
a
relief
to
me
it
would
be
if
dear
mother
was
always
at
hand
that
you
might
have
a
stew
when
you
liked
what
a
load
it
would
be
off
my
mind
again
for
pickles
not
at
all
like
anybody
else
pickles
her
red
cabbage
why
it
as
crisp
as
biscuit
and
then
her
walnuts
and
her
eh
caudle
you
know
how
you
love
pickles
and
how
we
sometimes
tiff
about
now
if
dear
mother
was
here
a
word
would
never
pass
between
us
and
i
sure
nothing
would
make
me
happier
for
you
not
asleep
caudle
for
i
ca
bear
to
quarrel
can
i
love
the
children
too
are
so
fond
of
her
and
she
be
such
a
help
to
me
with
i
sure
with
dear
mother
in
the
house
i
should
care
a
fig
for
measles
or
any
thing
of
the
sort
as
a
nurse
she
such
a
treasure
and
at
her
time
of
life
what
a
needlewoman
and
the
darning
and
mending
for
the
children
it
really
gets
quite
beyond
me
now
caudle
now
with
mother
at
my
hand
there
would
be
a
stitch
wanted
in
the
house
and
then
when
you
out
late
caudle
for
i
know
you
must
be
out
late
sometimes
i
ca
expect
you
of
course
to
be
always
at
home
why
then
dear
mother
could
sit
up
for
you
and
nothing
would
delight
the
dear
soul
half
so
much
and
so
caudle
love
i
think
dear
mother
had
better
come
do
you
eh
caudle
now
you
not
asleep
darling
do
you
think
better
come
you
say
you
say
again
wo
have
you
say
wo
that
flat
caudle
cau
die
here
caudle
says
in
his
suddenly
went
into
tears
and
i
went
to
lecture
xii
caudle
having
come
home
a
little
late
declares
that
henceforth
he
will
have
a
on
my
word
caudle
i
think
it
a
waste
of
time
to
come
to
bed
at
all
now
the
cocks
will
be
crowing
in
a
minute
keeping
people
up
till
past
twelve
oh
yes
you
thought
a
man
of
very
fine
feelings
out
of
doors
i
dare
say
it
a
pity
you
have
a
little
feeling
for
those
belonging
to
you
at
home
a
nice
hour
to
keep
people
out
of
their
beds
did
i
sit
up
then
because
i
chose
to
sit
up
but
that
my
thanks
no
it
no
use
your
talking
caudle
i
never
let
the
girl
sit
up
for
you
and
there
an
end
what
do
you
say
does
she
sit
up
with
me
then
that
quite
a
different
matter
you
suppose
i
going
to
sit
up
alone
do
you
what
do
you
say
the
use
of
two
sitting
up
that
my
business
no
caudle
it
no
such
thing
i
sit
up
because
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
talking
about
it
and
you
an
ungrateful
unfeeling
creature
to
say
so
i
sit
up
because
i
choose
it
and
if
you
do
come
home
all
the
night
long
and
will
soon
come
to
that
i
no
doubt
still
i
never
go
to
bed
so
do
think
it
oh
yes
the
time
runs
away
very
pleasantly
with
you
men
at
your
clubs
selfish
creatures
you
can
laugh
and
sing
and
tell
stories
and
never
think
of
the
clock
never
think
there
such
a
person
as
a
wife
belonging
to
you
it
nothing
to
you
that
a
poor
woman
sitting
up
and
telling
the
minutes
and
seeing
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
fire
and
sometimes
thinking
that
something
dreadful
has
happened
to
you
more
fool
she
to
care
a
straw
about
you
this
is
all
nothing
oh
no
when
a
woman
once
married
she
a
slave
worse
than
a
slave
and
must
bear
it
all
and
what
you
men
can
find
to
talk
about
i
ca
think
instead
of
a
man
sitting
every
night
at
home
with
his
wife
and
going
to
bed
at
a
christian
hour
going
to
a
club
to
meet
a
set
of
people
who
do
care
a
button
for
him
it
monstrous
what
do
you
say
only
go
once
a
week
that
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
you
might
as
well
go
every
night
and
i
dare
say
you
will
soon
but
if
you
do
you
may
get
in
as
you
can
wo
sit
up
for
you
i
can
tell
you
my
health
being
destroyed
night
after
oh
do
say
only
once
a
week
i
tell
you
that
nothing
to
do
with
it
if
you
had
any
eyes
you
would
see
how
ill
i
am
but
you
no
eyes
for
anybody
belonging
to
you
oh
no
your
eyes
are
for
people
out
of
doors
very
well
for
you
to
call
me
a
foolish
aggravating
woman
i
should
like
to
see
the
woman
who
sit
up
for
you
as
i
do
did
want
me
to
sit
up
yes
yes
that
your
thanks
that
your
gratitude
i
to
ruin
my
health
and
to
be
abused
for
it
nice
principles
you
got
at
that
club
caudle
but
there
one
comfort
one
great
comfort
it
ca
last
long
sinking
i
feel
it
though
i
never
say
anything
about
it
but
i
know
my
own
feelings
and
i
say
it
ca
last
long
and
then
i
should
like
to
know
who
sit
up
for
you
then
i
should
like
to
know
how
your
second
wife
what
do
you
say
never
be
troubled
with
another
troubled
indeed
i
never
troubled
you
caudle
no
it
you
troubled
me
and
you
know
it
though
like
a
foolish
woman
i
borne
it
all
and
never
said
a
word
about
it
but
it
last
that
one
blessing
oh
if
a
woman
could
only
know
what
she
have
to
suffer
before
she
was
married
do
tell
me
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
if
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
you
should
come
at
proper
hours
it
time
to
get
up
for
what
i
know
now
should
wonder
if
you
hear
the
milk
in
five
minutes
there
the
sparrows
up
already
yes
i
say
the
sparrows
and
caudle
you
ought
to
blush
to
hear
do
hear
ha
you
wo
hear
you
mean
hear
no
caudle
it
the
wind
whistling
in
the
i
not
quite
foolish
though
you
may
think
so
i
hope
i
know
wind
from
a
sparrow
ha
when
i
think
what
a
man
you
were
before
we
were
married
but
you
now
another
person
quite
creature
but
i
suppose
you
all
alike
i
dare
say
every
poor
woman
troubled
and
put
upon
though
i
should
hope
not
so
much
as
i
am
indeed
i
should
hope
not
going
and
staying
out
and
what
have
a
key
will
you
not
while
i
alive
caudle
i
not
going
to
bed
with
the
door
upon
the
latch
for
you
or
the
best
man
breathing
wo
have
a
latch
have
a
chubb
lock
will
you
i
have
no
chubb
here
i
can
tell
you
what
do
you
say
have
the
lock
put
on
well
try
it
that
all
i
say
caudle
try
it
i
wo
let
you
put
me
in
a
passion
but
all
i
say
is
try
it
a
respectable
thing
that
for
a
married
man
to
carry
about
with
him
a
key
that
tells
a
tale
i
think
a
nice
thing
for
the
father
of
a
family
a
key
what
to
let
yourself
in
and
out
when
you
please
to
come
in
like
a
thief
in
the
middle
of
the
night
instead
of
knocking
at
the
door
like
a
decent
person
oh
do
tell
me
that
you
only
want
to
prevent
me
sitting
up
if
i
choose
to
sit
up
what
that
to
you
some
wives
indeed
would
make
a
noise
about
sitting
up
but
no
reason
to
complain
goodness
knows
well
upon
my
word
i
lived
to
hear
something
carry
the
key
about
with
you
i
heard
of
such
things
with
young
bachelors
with
nobody
to
care
what
became
of
but
for
a
married
man
to
leave
his
wife
and
children
in
the
house
with
the
door
upon
the
latch
do
talk
to
me
about
chubb
it
all
the
same
a
great
deal
you
must
care
for
us
yes
it
very
well
for
you
to
say
that
you
only
want
the
key
for
peace
and
quietness
what
it
to
you
if
i
like
to
sit
up
you
no
business
to
complain
it
ca
distress
you
now
it
no
use
your
talking
all
i
say
is
this
caudle
if
you
send
a
man
to
put
on
any
lock
here
i
call
in
a
policeman
as
i
your
married
wife
i
will
no
i
think
when
a
man
comes
to
have
the
key
the
sooner
he
turns
bachelor
again
the
better
i
sure
caudle
i
do
want
to
be
any
clog
upon
you
now
its
no
use
your
telling
me
to
hold
my
tongue
for
i
what
i
give
you
the
do
i
no
i
do
caudle
your
club
that
gives
you
the
it
your
smoke
and
your
well
if
ever
i
knew
such
a
man
in
all
my
life
there
no
saying
a
word
to
you
you
go
out
and
treat
yourself
like
an
emperor
and
come
home
at
twelve
at
night
or
any
hour
for
what
i
know
and
then
you
threaten
to
have
a
key
and
and
and
i
get
to
sleep
at
last
says
caudle
amidst
the
falling
sentences
of
children
into
a
lodging
maintenance
be
made
a
slave
of
and
so
lecture
xiii
caudle
has
been
to
see
her
dear
mother
caudle
on
the
joyful
occasion
has
given
a
party
and
issued
the
annexed
card
of
invitation
illustration
it
hard
i
think
caudle
that
i
ca
leave
home
for
a
day
or
two
but
the
house
must
be
turned
into
a
tavern
a
tavern
a
pothouse
yes
i
thought
you
were
very
anxious
that
i
should
go
i
thought
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
for
something
or
you
would
not
have
insisted
on
my
staying
at
dear
mother
all
night
you
were
afraid
i
should
get
cold
coming
home
were
you
oh
yes
you
can
be
very
tender
you
can
caudle
when
it
suits
your
own
purpose
yes
and
the
world
thinks
what
a
good
husband
you
are
i
only
wish
the
world
knew
you
as
well
as
i
do
that
all
but
it
shall
some
day
i
determined
i
sure
the
house
will
not
be
sweet
for
a
month
all
the
curtains
are
poisoned
with
smoke
and
what
more
with
the
filthiest
smoke
i
ever
knew
down
then
yes
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
take
down
but
they
were
only
cleaned
and
put
up
a
month
ago
but
a
careful
wife
lost
upon
you
caudle
you
ought
to
have
married
somebody
who
have
let
your
house
go
to
wreck
and
ruin
as
i
will
for
the
future
people
who
do
care
for
their
families
are
better
thought
of
than
those
who
do
i
long
found
out
and
what
a
condition
the
carpet
in
they
taken
five
pounds
out
of
it
if
a
farthing
with
their
filthy
boots
and
i
do
know
what
besides
and
then
the
smoke
in
the
and
a
large
burnt
in
it
i
never
saw
such
a
house
in
life
if
you
wanted
to
have
a
few
friends
why
could
you
invite
when
your
wife
at
home
like
any
other
man
not
have
sneaking
in
like
a
set
of
housebreakers
directly
a
woman
turns
her
back
they
must
be
pretty
gentlemen
they
must
mean
fellows
that
are
afraid
to
face
a
woman
ha
and
you
all
call
yourselves
the
lords
of
the
creation
i
should
only
like
to
see
what
would
become
of
the
creation
if
you
were
left
to
yourselves
a
pretty
pickle
creation
would
be
in
very
soon
you
must
all
have
been
in
a
nice
condition
what
do
you
say
took
nothing
took
nothing
did
you
i
sure
there
such
a
regiment
of
empty
bottles
i
have
had
the
heart
to
count
and
punch
too
you
must
have
punch
there
a
hundred
in
the
kitchen
if
there
one
for
susan
like
a
good
girl
kept
to
show
me
no
sir
susan
leave
the
house
what
do
you
say
has
no
right
to
tell
tales
and
you
will
be
master
in
your
own
house
will
you
if
you
do
alter
caudle
you
soon
have
no
house
to
be
master
of
a
whole
loaf
of
sugar
did
i
leave
in
the
cupboard
and
now
there
as
much
as
would
fill
a
do
you
suppose
i
to
find
sugar
for
punch
for
fifty
men
what
do
you
say
was
fifty
that
no
matter
the
more
shame
for
sir
i
sure
they
drank
enough
for
fifty
do
you
suppose
i
to
find
sugar
for
punch
for
all
the
world
out
of
my
housekeeping
money
do
ask
me
do
you
ask
me
you
do
you
know
you
do
for
if
i
only
want
a
shilling
extra
the
house
is
in
a
blaze
and
yet
a
whole
loaf
of
sugar
can
you
throw
away
upon
no
i
be
still
and
i
let
you
go
to
sleep
if
you
got
to
bed
at
a
proper
hour
last
night
you
would
have
been
so
sleepy
now
you
can
sit
up
half
the
night
with
a
pack
of
people
who
do
care
for
you
and
your
poor
wife
ca
get
in
a
word
and
there
that
china
image
that
i
had
when
i
was
married

have
taken
any
sum
of
money
for
it
and
you
know
it
and
how
do
i
find
it
with
its
precious
head
knocked
off
and
what
was
more
mean
more
contemptible
than
all
besides
it
was
put
on
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
knew
nothing
about
it
now
how
can
you
lie
there
in
your
christian
bed
caudle
and
say
that
you
know
that
that
fellow
prettyman
knocked
off
the
head
with
the
poker
you
know
that
he
did
and
you
had
the
feeling
yes
i
will
say
it
you
had
the
feeling
to
protect
what
you
knew
was
precious
to
me
oh
no
if
the
truth
was
known
you
were
very
glad
to
see
it
broken
for
that
very
reason
every
way
i
been
insulted
i
should
like
to
know
who
it
was
who
corked
whiskers
on
my
dear
aunt
picture
oh
you
laughing
are
you
not
laughing
do
tell
me

should
like

not
laughing
yes
corked
whiskers
on
her
dear
face
and
she
was
a
good
soul
to
you
caudle
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
to
see
her
oh
you
may
laugh
it
very
easy
to
laugh
i
only
wish
you
a
little
feeling
like
other
people
that
all
then
there
my
china
mug
the
mug
i
had
before
i
was
married
when
i
was
a
happy
creature
i
should
like
to
know
who
knocked
the
spout
off
that
mug
do
tell
me
it
was
cracked
before
it
no
such
thing
caudle
there
was
a
flaw
in
it
and
now
i
could
have
cried
when
i
saw
it
do
tell
me
it
was
worth
twopence
how
do
you
know
you
never
buy
mugs
but
that
like
men
they
think
nothing
in
a
house
costs
anything
there
four
glasses
broke
and
nine
cracked
at
least
that
all
found
out
at
present
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
discover
a
dozen
and
i
should
like
to
know
where
the
cotton
umbrella
gone
to
and
i
should
like
to
know
who
broke
the
and
perhaps
you
do
know
there
a
leg
off
a
chair
and
perhaps
here
says
caudle
morpheus
came
to
my
aid
and
i
slept
nay
i
think
i
snored
