i
the
branches
of
the
forest
invoked
the
sky
with
the
supplications
of
their
thousand
hands
black
tumultuous
terrible
the
wilds
billowed
under
the
moon
stifled
with
the
night
silent
as
a
windless
sea
winter
like
a
pale
semiramis
of
gigantic
mould
stood
with
her
coronet
touching
the
steely
sky
a
mighty
company
of
stars
stared
from
the
heavens
a
pillar
of
fire
shone
red
amid
the
chaos
of
the
woods
like
a
great
torch
a
blazing
tower
hurled
spears
of
light
into
the
gloom
shadows
vast
and
fantastic
struggled
like
titans
striving
with
destiny
in
the
silence
of
the
night
their
substanceless
limbs
leapt
and
writhed
through
the
gnarled
alleys
of
the
forest
overhead
the
moon
looked
down
with
thin
and
silver
lethargy
on
the
havoc
kindled
by
the
hand
of
man
in
a
glade
all
golden
with
the
breath
of
the
fire
blackened
battlements
waved
a
pennon
of
vermilion
flame
above
the
woods
smoke
in
eddying
and
gilded
clouds
rolled
heavenwards
to
be
silvered
into
snow
by
the
light
of
the
moon
the
grass
of
the
glade
shone
a
dusky
yet
brilliant
green
the
tower
s
windows
were
red
as
rubies
on
a
pall
of
sables
about
its
base
cottages
were
burning
like
faggots
piled
about
a
martyr
s
loins
tragedy
had
touched
the
place
with
her
ruddy
hand
there
had
been
savage
deeds
done
in
the
silence
of
the
woods
hirelings
a
rough
pack
of
mercenaries
in
the
service
of
the
lord
flavian
of
gambrevault
had
stolen
upon
the
tower
of
rual
of
cambremont
slain
him
before
his
own
gate
and
put
his
sons
to
the
sword
a
feud
had
inspired
the
event
a
rotten
shred
of
enmity
woven
on
stephen
s
eve
in
a
tavern
scuffle
the
burning
tower
with
its
cracking
walls
bore
witness
to
the
extravagant
malice
of
a
rugged
age
death
that
flinty
summoner
salves
but
the
dead
yet
wounds
the
living
it
is
sport
with
him
to
pile
woe
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
weak
to
crown
with
thorns
the
brows
of
those
who
mourn
are
his
blessings
a
balm
for
those
who
sleep
an
iron
scourge
for
the
living
the
quick
bow
down
before
his
feet
only
the
dead
fear
him
no
more
in
the
marble
philosophy
of
silence
on
a
patch
of
grass
within
the
golden
whirl
of
the
fire
lay
the
body
of
rual
of
cambremont
stiff
and
still
his
face
was
turned
to
the
heavens
his
white
beard
tinctured
with
the
dye
of
death
beside
him
knelt
a
girl
whose
unloosed
hair
trailed
on
his
body
dark
and
disastrous
as
a
sable
cloud
the
girl
s
eyes
were
tearless
dry
and
dim
her
hands
were
at
her
throat
clenched
in
an
ecstasy
of
despair
her
head
was
bowed
down
below
her
stooping
shoulders
and
she
knelt
like
thea
over
saturn
s
shame
behind
her
in
the
shadow
his
face
grey
in
the
uncertain
gloom
an
old
man
watched
the
scene
with
a
wordless
awe
he
was
a
servant
thin
and
meagre
bowed
under
time
s
burden
a
dried
wisp
of
manhood
living
symbol
of
decay
there
was
something
of
the
dog
about
his
look
a
dumb
loyalty
that
grieved
and
gave
no
sound
beneath
the
burning
tower
in
the
heat
of
the
flames
these
twain
seemed
to
mimic
the
stillness
of
the
dead
there
was
other
life
in
the
glade
none
the
less
a
red
relic
evidencing
the
handiwork
of
the
sword
a
streak
of
shadow
that
had
lain
motionless
in
the
yellow
glare
of
the
fire
stirred
in
the
rank
grass
with
a
snuffling
groan
there
was
a
curt
hint
in
the
sound
that
brought
jaspar
the
harper
round
upon
his
heel
he
moved
two
steps
went
down
on
his
knees
in
the
ooze
turned
the
man
s
head
towards
the
tower
and
peered
into
his
face
it
was
gashed
from
chin
to
brow
a
grim
mask
of
war
contorted
the
more
by
the
uncertain
palpitations
of
the
flames
jaspar
had
a
flask
buckled
at
his
girdle
he
thrust
his
knee
under
the
man
s
head
trickled
wine
between
his
lips
and
waited
the
limp
hands
began
to
twitch
the
man
jerked
drew
a
wet
stertorous
breath
stared
for
a
moment
with
flickering
lids
at
the
face
above
him
jaspar
craned
down
put
his
mouth
to
the
man
s
ear
and
spoke
to
him
the
fellow
s
lips
quivered
he
stirred
a
little
strove
to
lift
his
head
mumbled
thickly
like
a
man
with
a
palsied
tongue
jaspar
put
his
ear
to
the
bruised
mouth
and
listened
he
won
words
out
of
the
grave
for
his
rough
face
hardened
his
brows
were
knotted
over
the
dying
man
s
stumbling
syllables
the
harper
shouted
in
his
ear
and
again
waited

all

ran
the

utterance
ave

a
cough
snapped
the
halting
appeal
the
man
stiffened
suddenly
in
jaspar
s
arms
and
thrust
out
his
feet
with
a
strong
spasm
his
hands
clawed
the
grass
his
jaw
fell
leaving
his
mouth
agape
a
black
circle
of
death
there
was
a
last
rattling
stridor
then
the
head
fell
back
over
jaspar
s
knee
with
the
neck
extended
the
eyes
wide
with
a
visionless
stare
a
shadow
fell
athwart
the
dead
man
and
the
living
a
shadow
edged
with
the
golden
web
of
the
fire
looking
up
jaspar
the
harper
saw
the
girl
standing
above
him
staring
down
upon
the
dead
man
s
body
the
red
tower
framed
her
figure
with
flame
making
an
ebon
cloud
of
her
hair
her
body
a
pillar
of
sombre
stone
her
face
was
grey
pinched
and
expressionless
youth
seemed
frozen
for
the
moment
into
bleak
and
premature
age
she
bowed
down
suddenly
her
hair
falling
forward
like
a
cataract
her
eyes
large
with
a
tearless
hunger
pointing
to
the
man
on
jaspar
s
knee
she
looked
into
the
harper
s
face
and
spoke
to
him
quick
the
truth
i
fear
it
no
longer
her
voice
was
toneless
and
hoarse
as
an
untuned
string
she
beat
her
hands
together
and
then
stood
with
her
fists
pressed
over
her
heart
quick
the
truth
the
old
man
turned
the
body
gently
to
the
grass
and
still
knelt
at
the
woman
s
feet
it
is
jean
he
said
with
great
quietness
jean
the
swineherd
he
is
dead
god
rest
his
soul
she
bent
forward
again
with
arm
extended
her
voice
deep
and
hoarse
in
her
throat
tell
me
who
is
it
that
has
slain
my
father
they
of
gambrevault
ah
her
eyes
gleamed
behind
her
hair
as
it
fell
dishevelled
over
her
face
and
the
rest
bertrand
my
brothers
her
voice
appealed
him
with
a
gradual
fear
jaspar
the
harper
bowed
his
face
and
pointed
to
the
tower
the
girl
straightened
and
stood
quivering
like
a
loosened
bow
god
in
there
and
roland
again
the
harper
s
hand
went
up
with
the
slow
inevitableness
of
destiny
the
flames
as
beneath
the
incantations
of
a
sibyl
leapt
higher
roaring
hungrily
towards
the
heavens
the
girl
swayed
away
some
paces
her
lips
moving
silently
her
hair
fanned
by
the
draught
blowing
about
her
like
a
veil
she
turned
to
the
tower
thrust
up
her
hands
to
it
with
a
strong
gesture
of
anguish
and
despair
a
long
while
she
stood
in
silence
as
in
a
kind
of
torpor
gazing
at
this
red
pyre
of
the
past
where
memories
leapt
heavenwards
in
a
golden
haze
of
smoke
the
roar
of
the
fire
was
as
the
voice
of
fate
she
heard
it
dim
and
distant
like
the
far
thunder
of
a
sea
beyond
around
above
the
gaunt
trees
clawed
at
the
stars
with
their
leafless
talons
night
and
the
shadow
of
it
were
very
apparent
to
the
girl
s
soul
jaspar
the
harper
stood
and
watched
her
with
a
dumb
and
distant
awe
her
rigid
anguish
cowed
him
into
impotent
silence
the
woman
s
soul
seemed
to
soar
far
above
comfort
following
the
saffron
smoke
into
the
silver
Ã¦ther
of
the
infinite
the
man
stood
apart
holding
aloof
with
the
instinct
of
a
dog
from
a
sorrow
that
he
could
not
chasten
he
was
one
of
those
dull
yet
happy
souls
who
carry
eloquence
in
their
eyes
whose
tongues
are
clumsy
but
whose
hearts
are
warm
he
stood
aloof
therefore
from
yeoland
dead
rual
s
daughter
pulling
his
ragged
beard
and
calling
in
prayer
to
the
virgin
and
the
saints
presently
the
girl
turned
very
slowly
as
one
whose
blood
runs
chill
and
heavy
her
eyes
were
still
dry
and
crystal
bright
her
face
like
granite
or
a
mask
of
ice
the
man
jaspar
hid
his
glances
from
her
and
stared
at
the
sod
he
was
fearful
in
measure
of
gaping
blankly
upon
so
great
a
grief
jaspar
she
said
and
her
voice
was
clear
now
as
the
keen
sweep
of
a
sword
he
crooked
the
knee
to
her
stood
shading
his
eyes
with
his
wrinkled
hand
we
alone
are
left
she
said
god
s
will
madame
god
s
will
he
giveth
and
taketh
away
i
even
i
am
your
servant
her
eyes
lightened
an
instant
as
though
red
wrath
streamed
strongly
from
her
heart
her
mouth
quivered
she
chilled
the
mood
however
and
stood
motionless
save
for
her
hands
twining
and
twisting
in
her
hair
does
heaven
mock
me
she
asked
him
with
a
level
bitterness
how
so
madame
he
answered
her
who
would
mock
thee
at
such
an
hour
who
indeed
not
even
death
i
pray
you
be
comforted
there
is
a
balm
in
years
they
stood
silent
again
in
the
streaming
heat
and
radiance
of
the
fire
a
sudden
wind
had
risen
they
heard
it
crying
far
away
in
the
infinite
vastness
of
the
woods
it
grew
rushed
near
waxed
with
a
gradual
clamour
till
the
bare
wilds
seemed
to
breathe
one
great
gathering
roar
the
flames
flew
slanting
from
the
blackened
battlements
the
trees
clutched
and
swayed
making
moan
under
the
calm
light
of
the
moon
the
sound
thrilled
the
girl
her
lips
trembled
her
form
dilated
listen
she
said
thrusting
up
her
hands
into
the
night
the
cry
of
the
forest
the
voice
of
the
winter
wind
what
say
they
but
vengeance
vengeance
vengeance
ii
dawn
came
vaguely
in
a
veil
of
mist
a
heavy
dew
lay
scintillant
upon
the
grass
a
great
silence
covered
the
woods
the
trees
stood
grim
and
gigantic
with
dripping
boughs
in
a
vapoury
atmosphere
and
there
seemed
no
augury
of
sunlight
in
the
blind
grey
sky
a
rough
hovel
under
a
fir
used
for
the
storing
of
wood
had
given
yeoland
and
the
harper
shelter
for
the
night
the
sole
refuge
left
to
them
by
fire
the
hut
had
served
its
purpose
well
enough
for
grief
is
not
given
to
grumbling
over
externals
in
the
extremity
of
its
distress
the
girl
yeoland
was
astir
early
with
the
first
twitter
of
the
birds
in
the
boughs
overhead
jaspar
had
made
her
a
couch
of
straw
and
she
had
lain
there
tossing
to
and
fro
with
no
thought
of
sleep
the
moon
had
sunk
early
over
the
edge
of
the
world
and
heavy
darkness
had
wrapped
her
anguish
close
about
her
soul
mocking
her
with
the
staring
of
a
dead
face
the
burning
tower
had
ceased
to
torch
her
vigil
towards
dawn
yet
there
had
been
no
fleeing
from
the
pale
candour
of
the
night
a
slim
woman
she
stood
shivering
in
the
doorway
of
the
hovel
her
eyes
were
black
and
lustrous
swift
darting
eyes
full
of
dusky
fire
and
vivid
unrest
her
mouth
ran
a
red
streak
firm
above
her
white
chin
her
hair
gleamed
like
sable
steel
the
world
was
cold
about
her
for
the
moment
dead
and
inert
as
her
own
heart
as
she
stood
there
fine
and
fragile
as
gossamer
the
very
trees
seemed
to
weep
for
her
with
the
dawning
day
some
hundred
paces
from
the
hut
a
cloud
of
smoke
mingled
with
the
mist
that
hung
about
the
blackened
walls
of
the
forest
tower
its
windows
were
blind
and
frameless
to
the
sky
a
zone
of
charred
wood
and
reeking
ashes
circled
its
base
the
mist
hung
above
it
like
a
ghostly
memory
the
place
looked
desolate
and
pitiful
enough
in
the
meagre
light
the
girl
yeoland
watched
the
incense
of
smoke
wreathing
grey
spirals
overhead
melting
symbolic
into
nothingness
the
pungent
scent
of
the
ruin
floated
down
to
her
and
became
a
recollection
for
all
time
this
blackened
shell
had
been
a
home
to
her
a
bulwark
nay
a
cradle
sanguine
life
had
run
ruddy
through
its
heart
how
often
had
she
seen
its
grey
brow
crowned
with
gold
by
the
mystic
hierarchy
of
heaven
she
had
found
much
joy
there
and
little
sorrow
a
wrinkled
face
had
taught
her
these
many
years
to
cherish
the
innocence
of
childhood
all
this
was
past
the
present
found
her
bankrupt
of
such
things
the
place
had
become
but
a
coffin
a
for
the
rotting
bones
of
love
as
she
brooded
in
the
doorway
the
smite
of
a
spade
came
ringing
to
her
on
the
misty
air
terse
and
rhythmic
it
was
like
the
sound
of
time
plucking
the
hours
from
the
tree
of
life
she
looked
out
over
the
glade
and
saw
jaspar
the
harper
digging
a
shallow
grave
under
an
oak
she
went
and
watched
him
calmly
silently
with
the
utter
quiet
of
a
measureless
grief
there
was
reason
in
this
labour
it
emphasised
reality
helped
her
to
grip
the
present
as
the
brown
earth
tumbled
at
her
feet
she
remembered
how
much
she
would
bury
in
that
narrow
forest
grave
the
man
jaspar
was
a
ruddy
soul
like
a
red
apple
in
autumn
his
strong
point
was
his
loyalty
a
virtue
that
had
stiffened
with
the
fibres
of
his
heart
he
could
boast
neither
of
vast
intelligence
nor
of
phenomenal
courage
but
he
had
a
conscience
that
had
made
gold
of
his
whole
rough
stunted
body
your
clever
servant
is
often
a
rogue
in
the
respect
of
apt
villainy
the
harper
was
a
fool
he
ceased
now
and
again
from
his
digging
hung
his
hooked
chin
over
his
spade
and
snuffed
the
savour
of
the
clean
brown
earth
he
thrust
curt
furtive
glances
up
into
the
girl
s
face
as
she
watched
him
as
though
desirous
of
reading
her
humour
or
her
health
you
are
weary
she
said
to
him
anon
looking
blankly
into
the
trench
the
man
wagged
his
head
have
ye
broken
fast
there
is
bread
and
dried
fruit
in
the
hut
and
a
pitcher
of
water
i
can
not
eat
yet
she
answered
him
he
sighed
and
continued
his
digging
the
pile
of
russet
earth
increased
on
the
green
grass
at
her
feet
the
trench
deepened
jaspar
moistened
his
palms
and
toiled
on
grunting
as
he
hove
his
libations
of
soil
over
his
shoulder
presently
he
stood
up
again
to
rest
what
will
you
do
madame
he
asked
her
squinting
at
the
clouds
ride
out
and
whither
towards
gilderoy
as
yet
ah
ah
a
fair
town
and
strong
john
of
brissac
is
madame
s
friend
good
have
we
money
some
gold
nobles
they
waxed
silent
again
and
in
a
while
the
grave
lay
finished
twas
shallow
but
what
of
that
it
gave
sanctuary
enough
for
the
dead
they
went
together
and
gazed
on
the
sleeping
man
s
face
it
was
grey
but
very
peaceful
with
no
hint
of
horror
thereon
the
eyes
were
closed
and
dew
had
starred
the
white
hair
with
a
glistening
web
yeoland
knelt
and
kissed
the
forehead
she
shivered
and
her
hands
trembled
but
she
did
not
weep
so
they
carried
the
lord
rual
between
them
for
he
was
a
spare
man
and
frugal
of
frame
and
laid
him
in
the
grave
beneath
the
oak
when
they
had
smoothed
his
hair
and
crossed
his
hands
upon
his
breast
they
knelt
and
prayed
to
the
virgin
and
the
saints
that
in
god
s
heaven
he
might
have
peace
the
wind
in
the
boughs
sang
a
forest
requiem
when
yeoland
had
looked
long
at
the
white
face
in
the
trench
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
pointed
jaspar
to
his
spade
the
harper
took
the
measure
of
her
mind
when
she
had
passed
into
the
shadows
of
the
trees
he
mopped
his
face
and
entered
on
his
last
duty
to
the
dead
it
was
soon
sped
soon
ended
a
pile
of
clean
earth
covered
the
place
jaspar
banked
the
grave
with
turf
shouldered
his
spade
and
returned
to
the
hovel
he
found
the
girl
yeoland
seated
on
a
fallen
tree
in
the
forest
her
ebon
hair
and
gown
gleaming
under
the
sweeping
boughs
her
cheeks
were
white
as
windflowers
her
eyes
full
of
a
swimming
gloom
she
raised
her
chin
and
questioned
the
man
mutely
with
a
look
that
smouldered
under
her
arched
brows
jaspar
madame
have
you
entered
the
tower
the
man
s
wrinkled
face
winced
despite
his
years
would
you
have
me
go
he
asked
her
in
a
hoarse
undertone
she
looked
into
the
vast
mazes
of
the
woods
shuddered
in
thought
and
was
silent
her
mouth
hardened
the
desire
melted
from
her
eyes
no
she
said
anon
turning
her
hood
forward
and
drawing
a
green
cloak
edged
with
sables
about
her
what
would
it
avail
us
let
us
sally
at
once
a
little
distance
away
their
horses
that
had
been
hobbled
over
night
stood
grazing
quietly
on
a
patch
of
grass
under
the
trees
one
was
a
great
grey
mare
the
other
a
bay
jennet
glossy
as
silk
jaspar
caught
them
he
was
long
over
the
girths
and
bridles
for
his
hands
were
stiff
and
his
eyes
dim
when
he
returned
yeoland
was
still
standing
like
a
statue
staring
at
the
blackened
tower
reeking
amid
the
trees
truly
they
have
burnt
the
anguish
of
it
into
my
heart
with
fire
she
said
as
jaspar
held
her
stirrup
god
comfort
you
madame
let
us
go
jaspar
let
us
go
and
whither
lady
where
revenge
may
lead
the
day
brightened
as
they
plunged
down
into
the
forest
a
light
breeze
rent
the
vapours
and
a
shimmer
of
sunlight
quivered
through
the
haze
the
began
to
glisten
gold
and
there
was
life
in
the
deepening
promise
of
the
sky
the
empty
woods
rolled
purple
on
the
hills
the
greensward
shone
with
a
veil
of
gossamer
the
earth
grew
glad
the
pair
had
scant
burden
of
speech
upon
their
lips
that
morning
they
were
still
benumbed
by
the
violence
of
the
night
and
death
still
beckoned
to
their
souls
fate
had
smitten
them
with
such
incredible
and
ponderous
brevity
on
the
dawn
of
yesterday
they
had
ridden
out
hawk
on
wrist
into
the
wilds
lost
the
bird
in
a
long
flight
and
turned
homeward
when
evening
was
darkening
the
east
from
a
hill
they
had
seen
the
tower
lifting
its
flame
like
a
red
and
revengeful
finger
to
heaven
they
had
hastened
on
with
the
glare
of
the
fire
spasmodic
and
lurid
over
the
trees
in
one
short
hour
they
had
had
speech
with
death
and
came
point
to
point
with
the
bleak
sword
of
eternity
what
wonder
then
that
they
rode
like
mutes
to
a
burial
still
of
tongue
and
dull
of
heart
life
and
the
zest
thereof
were
at
low
ebb
colourless
as
a
wintry
sea
joy
s
crimson
wings
were
smirched
and
broken
the
lute
of
youth
was
unstrung
a
granite
sky
had
drawn
low
above
their
heads
and
to
the
girl
a
devil
ruled
the
heavens
before
noon
they
had
threaded
the
wild
waste
of
woodland
that
girded
the
tower
like
a
black
lagoon
they
came
out
from
the
trees
to
a
heath
a
track
that
struck
green
and
purple
into
the
west
and
boasted
nought
that
could
infringe
the
blue
monotony
of
the
sky
it
was
a
wild
region
swept
by
a
wind
that
sighed
perpetually
amid
the
gorse
and
heather
by
the
black
rim
of
the
forest
they
had
dismounted
and
partaken
of
bread
and
water
before
pushing
on
with
a
listless
persistence
that
won
many
miles
to
their
credit
the
man
jaspar
was
a
phlegmatic
soul
in
the
hot
sphere
of
action
he
was
a
circumspect
being
who
preferred
heading
for
the
blue
calm
of
a
haven
in
stormy
weather
to
thrusting
out
into
the
tossing
spume
of
the
unknown
the
girl
yeoland
on
the
contrary
had
an
abundant
spirit
and
an
untamed
temper
her
black
eyes
roved
restlessly
over
the
world
and
she
tilted
her
chin
in
the
face
of
fate
jaspar
knowing
her
fibre
feared
for
her
moods
with
the
more
level
prudence
of
stagnant
blood
her
obstinacy
was
a
hazardous
virtue
in
sentiment
not
given
to
perching
on
the
boughs
of
reason
moreover
being
cumbered
with
a
generous
burden
of
pity
he
was
in
mortal
dread
of
wounding
her
pale
proud
grief
by
way
of
being
diplomatic
he
began
by
hinting
that
there
were
necessities
in
life
trivial
no
doubt
but
inevitable
as
sleep
and
supper
lord
john
of
brissac

your

meandered
a
strong
lord
and

fontenaye

till

madame
had
no
thought
of
being
beholden
to
the
gentleman
in
question
jaspar
understood
as
much
from
a
very
brief
debate
lord
john
of
brissac
was
forbidden
favour
being
as
black
a
pard
when
justly
blazoned
as
any
seigneur
of
gambrevault
the
harper
s
chin
wagged
on
maugre
her
contradiction
we
have
bread
for
a
day
he
chirped
dropping
upon
banalities
by
way
of
seeming
wise
the
nights
are
cold
madame
damp
as
a
marsh
as
for
the
water
may
be
had
for
the
asking
and
bread
i
have
money
then
we
ride
for
gilderoy
the
assumption
was
made
with
an
excellent
unction
that
betrayed
the
seeming
sincerity
of
the
philosopher
yeoland
stared
ahead
over
her
horse
s
ears
with
a
clear
disregard
for
jaspar
and
his
discretion
we
are
like
leaves
blown
about
in
autumn
she
said
to
him
wanderers
with
fortune
you
have
not
grasped
my
temper
i
warrant
you
there
is
method
in
me
jaspar
looked
blank
strange
method
madame
to
ride
nowhere
to
compass
nothing
she
turned
on
him
with
a
sudden
rapid
gleam
out
of
her
passionate
eyes
nothing
you
call
revenge
nothing
the
harper
appealed
to
his
favourite
saint
jude
forfend
that
madame
should
follow
such
a
marsh
fire
he
said
they
had
drawn
towards
the
margin
of
the
heath
southwards
it
sloped
to
the
rim
of
a
great
pine
forest
that
seemed
to
clasp
it
with
ebonian
arms
the
place
was
black
mysterious
impenetrable
fringed
with
a
palisading
of
dark
stiff
trunks
but
all
else
a
vast
undulation
of
sombre
plumes
its
spires
waved
with
the
wind
there
was
a
soundless
awe
about
its
sable
galleries
a
saturnine
gloom
that
hung
like
a
curtain
in
the
vague
distance
a
misty
height
seemed
to
struggle
above
the
ocean
of
trees
like
the
back
of
some
great
beast
yeoland
keen
of
face
reined
in
her
jennet
and
pointed
jaspar
to
this
landscape
of
sombre
hues
there
was
an
alert
lustre
in
her
eyes
she
drew
her
breath
more
quickly
like
one
whose
courage
kindles
at
the
cry
of
a
trumpet
the
black
wild
she
said
with
a
little
hiss
of
eagerness
and
a
glance
that
was
almost
fierce
under
her
brows
jaspar
shook
his
head
with
the
cumbersome
wit
of
an
ogre
ha
yes
madame
a
bloody
region
packed
with
rumours
dark
as
its
own
trees
no
stint
of
terror
i
warrant
ye
see
yonder
the
road
to
gilderoy
the
girl
in
the
green
cloak
seemed
strongly
stirred
by
her
own
thoughts
her
face
had
a
wild
elfin
look
for
the
moment
a
beautiful
and
daring
insolence
that
deified
her
figure
and
gilderoy
she
said
abstractedly
gilderoy

many
leagues
southwards

find
the

nodded
as
though
her
mind
were
already
adamant
in
the
matter

will
take
to
the
forest

her
decretal
here
was
crass
sentiment
extravagantly
in
the
ascendant
mad
wilfulness
pinioning
forth
like
a
bat
into
gloom
jaspar
screwed
his
mouth
into
a
red
knot
blinked
and
waxed
argumentative
with
a
vehemence
that
did
his
circumspection
credit
a
mad
scheme
what
better
harbour
for
the
night
than
yonder
trees
who
will
choose
us
a
road
i
pray
you
consider
it
yeoland
answered
him
quietly
enough
she
had
set
her
will
on
the
venture
was
in
a
desperate
mood
and
could
therefore
scorn
reason
jaspar
my
friend
she
said
i

wild
humour

ripe
for

iii
the
avenues
of
the
pine
forest
engulfed
the
harper
and
the
lady
the
myriad
crowded
trunks
hemmed
them
with
a
stubborn
and
impassive
gloom
a
faint
wind
moved
in
the
dim
aisles
struck
into
an
mystery
of
shadow
as
into
the
dark
mazes
of
a
dream
the
wild
was
as
some
primÃ¦val
waste
desolate
and
terrible
a
vast
flood
of
sombre
green
rolling
over
hill
and
valley
its
thickets
plunged
midnight
into
the
bosom
of
day
on
the
hills
the
trees
stood
like
traceried
pinnacles
spears
in
the
sunset
or
splashed
with
the
glittering
magic
of
the
moon
there
were
dells
sunk
deep
beneath
crags
choked
with
dense
darkness
unsifted
by
the
sun
winding
alleys
white
with
pebbles
as
with
the
bones
of
the
dead
wound
through
seething
seas
of
gorse
in
summer
heather
sucked
with
purple
lips
at
the
tapestries
of
moss
blazoning
the

bronze
green
and
gold
it
was
a
wild
region
and
mysterious
a
shadowland
moaned
over
by
the
voice
of
a
distressful
wind
yeoland
held
southwards
by
the
gilded
vane
of
the
sun
she
had
turned
back
her
hood
upon
her
shoulders
and
fastened
her
black
hair
over
her
bosom
with
a
brooch
of
amethysts
the
girl
was
wise
in
woodlore
and
the
philosophies
of
nature
the
sounds
and
sights
of
the
forest
were
like
a
gorgeous
missal
to
her
blazoned
with
all
manner
of
magic
colours
she
knew
the
moods
of
hawk
and
hound
had
camped
often
under
the
steely
stare
of
a
winter
sky
had
watched
the
many
phases
of
the
dawn
hers
was
a
nature
ripe
for
the
hazardous
intent
of
life
it
was
she
who
led
not
jaspar
the
harper
followed
her
with
a
martyred
reason
having
for
all
his
discontent
some
faith
in
her
keen
eyes
and
the
delicate
decision
of
her
chin
there
was
a
steady
dejection
in
the
girl
s
mood
a
dejection
starred
however
with
red
wrath
like
sparks
glowing
upon
tinder
she
was
no
agnes
no
amorette
mere
pillar
of
luscious
beauty
her
eyes
were
as
shields
flashing
with
many
sheens
in
the
face
of
day
the
flaming
tower
the
dead
figure
in
the
forest
grave
had
thrust
the
gentler
part
out
of
her
being
she
was
miserable
mute
yet
full
of
a
volcanic
courage
as
for
the
harper
a
rheumy
dissatisfaction
pervaded
his
temper
his
blood
ran
cold
as
a
toad
s
in
winter
weather
he
blew
upon
his
fingers
dreaming
of
inglenooks
and
hot
posset
and
the
casual
luxuries
the
forest
did
not
promise
yeoland
considered
not
the
old
man
s
babblings
her
heart
looked
towards
the
dawn
and
knew
nothing
of
the
twilight
under
the
dark
eaves
of
age
they
had
pressed
a
mile
or
more
into
the
waste
and
the
day
was
waxing
sere
and
yellow
in
the
west
before
them
ran
a
huge
thicket
its
floor
splashed
with
tawny
splendours
the
sable
plumes
touched
with
gold
by
the
sun
its
deep
bosom
hung
full
of
purple
gloom
dusted
with
amber
wild
and
windless
a
sudden
hist
from
his
lady

lips
made
the
harper
start
in
the
saddle
her
hand
had
snatched
at
his
bridle
both
horses
came
to
a
halt
the
man
looked
at
her
as
they
sat
knee
to
knee
she
was
alert
and
vigilant
her
eyes
bright
as
the
eyes
of
a
hawk
marked
you
that
she
said
to
him
in
a
whisper

gave
her
a
vacant
stare

up

a
flash
it

they
held
silent
under
the
drooping
boughs
listening
with
noiseless
breath
the
breeze
made
mysterious
murmurings
with
a
vague
unrest
now
and
again
a
twig
cracked
or
some
forest
sound
floated
down
like
a
filmy
moth
on
the
quiet
air
the
trees
were
dumb
and
saturnine
as
though
resenting
suspicion
of
their
sable
aisles
jaspar
peering
over
his
shoulder
jerked
out
a
word
of
warning
yeoland
catching
the
monosyllable
from
his
lips
and
following
his
stare
glanced
back
into
the
eternal
shadows
of
the
place
i
see
nothing
she
said
jaspar
answered
her
slowly
his
eyes
still
at
gaze
a
shadow
slipping
from
trunk
to
trunk
where
i
see
it
no
longer
the
saints
succour
us
yeoland
s
face
was
dead
white
under
her
hair
her
mouth
gaped
like
a
circle
of
jet
she
listened
constantly
her
head
moved
in
stately
fashion
on
her
slim
neck
as
she
shot
glances
hither
and
thither
into
the
glooms
her
eyes
challenging
the
world
she
felt
peril
but
was
no
craven
in
the
matter
a
contrast
to
jaspar
who
shook
as
with
an
ague
the
harper
s
distress
broke
forth
into
petulant
declaiming
trapped
he
said
i
could
have
guessed
as
much
with
all
this
fooling
these
skulkers
are
like
crows
round
carrion
shall
we
lose
much
madame
gold
jaspar
if
they
are
content
with
such
what
if
they
should
be
of
gambrevault
the
harper
gave
a
quivering
whistle
a
shrill
breath
between
his
teeth
eloquent
of
the
unpleasant
savour
of
such
a
chance
it
was
beyond
him
for
the
moment
whether
he
preferred
being
held
up
by
a
footpad
to
being
bullied
by
some
ruffian
of
a
feudatory
he
had
a
mere
bodkin
of
a
dagger
in
his
belt
and
little
lust
for
the
letting
of
blood
tis
a
chance
madame
he
said
with
a
certain
lame
sententiousness
that
had
not
challenged
my
attention
say
nothing
of
cambremont
one
word
would
send
us
to
the
devil
am
i
a
fool
since
these
gentlemen
will
not
declare
themselves
let
us
hold
on
and
tempt
their
purpose
thinking
to
see
the
swirl
of
shadows
under
the
trees
the
glimmer
of
steel
in
the
forest
s
murk
they
rode
on
at
a
lifeless
trot
nothing
echoed
to
their
thoughts
the
woods
stood
impassive
steeped
in
solitude
there
was
a
strange
atmosphere
of
peace
about
the
place
that
failed
to
harmonise
their
fears
yet
like
a
prophecy
of
wind
there
stole
in
persistently
above
the
muffled
tramp
of
hoofs
a
dull
characterless
sound
touched
with
the
crackling
of
rotten
wood
that
seemed
to
hint
at
movement
in
the
shadows
the
pair
pressed
on
vigilant
and
silent
anon
they
came
to
a
less
multitudinous
region
where
the
trees
thinned
and
a
columned
ride
dwindled
into
infinite
gloom
betwixt
the
black
stems
of
the
trees
flashed
sudden
a
streak
of
scarlet
torchlike
in
the
shadows
an
armed
rider
in
a
red
cloak
mounted
on
a
sable
horse
kept
vigil
silently
between
the
boles
of
two
great
firs
he
was
immobile
as
rock
his
spear
set
rigid
on
his
thigh
his
red
plume
sweeping
the
green
fringes
of
the
trees
this
solemn
figure
stood
like
a
sanguinary
challenge
to
yeoland
and
the
harper
here
at
least
was
something
tangible
in
the
flesh
more
than
a
mere
shadow
the
pair
drew
rein
questioning
each
other
mutely
with
their
eyes
finding
no
glimmer
of
hope
on
either
face
as
they
debated
with
their
glances
over
the
hazard
a
voice
came
crying
weirdly
through
the
wood
pass
on
it
said
pass
on
pay
ye
the
homage
of
the
day
this
forest
cry
seemed
to
loosen
the
dilemma
certainly
it
bore
wisdom
in
its
counsel
seeing
that
it
advised
the
inevitable
and
ordered
action
yeoland
bankrupt
of
resource
took
the
unseen
herald
at
his
word
and
rode
on
slowly
towards
the
knight
on
the
black
horse
the
man
abode
their
coming
like
a
statue
his
red
cloak
shining
sensuously
under
the
sombre
green
of
the
boughs
a
canopy
of
golden
fire
arched
him
in
the
west
he
sat
his
horse
with
a
certain
splendid
arrogance
that
puzzled
not
a
little
the
conjectures
of
yeoland
and
the
harper
this
was
neither
the
mood
nor
the
equipment
of
a
vagabond
soul
the
fine
spirit
of
the
picture
hinted
briskly
at
gambrevault
the
pair
came
to
a
halt
under
the
two
firs
the
man
towered
above
them
on
his
horse
grim
and
gigantic
a
great
statue
in
black
and
burnished
steel
his
salade
with
beaver
lowered
shone
ruddy
in
the
sun
his
saddle
was
of
scarlet
leather
bossed
with
brass
and
fringed
with
sable
cord
gules
flamed
on
his
shield
devoid
of
all
device
a
strong
wedge
of
colour
bare
and
brave
the
girl
caught
the
gleam
of
the
man
s
eyes
through
the
grid
of
his
vizor
he
appeared
to
be
considering
her
much
at
his
leisure
with
a
keen
silence
that
was
not
wholly
comforting
palpably
he
was
in
no
mood
for
haste
or
for
such
casual
courtesies
that
might
have
ebbed
from
his
soundless
strength
full
two
minutes
passed
before
a
deep
voice
rolled
sonorously
from
the
cavern
of
the
casque
madame
it
said
be
good
enough
to
consider
yourself
my
prisoner
rest
assured
that
i
bring
you
no
peril
save
the
peril
of
an
empty
purse
there
was
a
certain
powerful
complacency
in
the
voice
pealing
with
the
deep
clamour
of
a
bell
through
the
silence
of
the
woods
the
man
seemed
less
ponderous
and
sinister
giant
that
he
was
the
girl
s
eyes
fenced
with
him
fearlessly
under
the
trees
presumably
she
said
to
him
you
are
a
notorious
fellow
i
have
the
misfortune
to
be
ignorant
of
these
parts
and
their
possessors
be
so
courteous
as
to
unhelm
to
me
her
tone
did
not
stir
the
man
from
his
reserve
of
gravity
her
words
were
indeed
like
so
many
ripples
breaking
against
a
rock
the
voice
retorted
to
her
calmly
from
the
helmet
madame
leave
matters
to
my
discretion
she
smiled
in
his
face
despite
herself
a
smile
half
of
petulance
half
of
relish
you
pretend
to
wisdom
sir
forethought
madame
am
i
your
prisoner
no
new
thing
madame
i
have
possessed
you
since
you
ventured
into
these
shadows
he
made
a
gesture
with
his
spear
holding
it
at
arm
s
length
above
his
head
where
it
quivered
like
a
reed
in
his
staunch
grip
a
sound
like
the
moving
of
a
distant
wind
arose
the
dark
alleys
of
the
wood
grew
silvered
with
a
circlet
of
steel
the
shafts
of
the
sunset
flickered
on
pike
and
bassinet
gleaming
amid
the
verdured
glooms
again
the
man
s
spear
shook
again
the
noise
as
of
a
wind
and
the
girdle
of
steel
melted
into
the
shadows
madame
is
satisfied
she
sucked
in
her
breath
through
her
red
lips
and
was
mute
leave
matters
to
my
discretion
you
there
in
the
brown
smock
fall
back
twenty
paces
madame
i
wait
for
you
let
us
go
cheek
by
jowl
the
man
wheeled
his
horse
shook
his
spear
hurled
a
glance
backward
over
his
shoulder
into
the
woods
there
was
no
gainsaying
him
for
the
moment
yeoland
bending
to
necessity
sent
jaspar
loitering
while
she
flanked
the
black
destrier
with
her
brown
jennet
she
debated
keenly
within
herself
whither
this
adventure
could
be
leading
her
as
she
rode
on
with
this
unknown
rider
into
the
wilds
the
man
in
the
red
cloak
was
wondrous
mute
at
first
an
iron
pillar
of
silence
gleaming
under
the
trees
the
girl
knew
that
he
was
watching
her
from
behind
his
salade
for
she
caught
often
the
white
glimmer
of
his
stare
he
bulked
largely
in
the
descending
gloom
a
big
man
deep
of
chest
with
shoulders
like
the
broad
ledges
of
some
rock
he
was
richly
appointed
both
as
to
his
armour
and
his
trappings
to
yeoland
his
shield
showed
a
blank
face
and
he
carried
no
crest
or
token
in
his
helmet
they
had
ridden
two
furlongs
or
more
before
the
man
stepped
from
his
pedestal
of
silence
he
had
been
studying
the
girl
with
the
mood
of
a
philosopher
had
seen
her
stark
strained
look
the
woe
in
her
eyes
the
firm
closure
of
her
lips
the
strong
pride
of
grief
in
her
had
pleased
him
moreover
he
had
had
good
leisure
to
determine
the
character
of
her
courage
his
first
words
were
neither
very
welcome
to
the
girl
s
ears
nor
productive
of
great
comfort
so
far
as
her
apprehensions
were
concerned
bluntly
came
the
calm
challenge
from
the
casque
daughter
of
rual
of
cambremont
you
have
changed
little
these
five
years
yeoland
gave
the
man
a
stare
seeing
that
his
features
were
screened
by
his
helmet
the
glance
won
her
little
satisfaction
she
knew
that
he
was
watching
her
to
his
own
profit
and
her
discovery
for
the
reflex
look
she
had
flashed
at
him
must
have
told
him
all
he
desired
if
he
had
any
claim
to
being
considered
observant
there
was
that
also
in
the
tone
and
tenor
of
his
words
that
implied
that
he
had
ventured
no
mere
tentative
statement
but
had
spoken
to
assure
her
that
her
name
and
person
were
not
unknown
to
him
acting
on
the
impression
she
tacitly
confessed
to
the
justice
of
his
charge
palpably
she
said
my
face
is
known
to
you
even
so
madame
how
long
will
you
hold
me
at
a
disadvantage
is
ignorance
burdensome
she
imagined
of
a
sudden
that
the
man
was
smiling
behind
his
beaver
being
utterly
serious
herself
she
discovered
an
illogical
lack
of
sympathy
in
the
stranger
s
humour
moreover
she
was
striving
to
spell
gambrevault
from
the
alphabet
of
word
and
gesture
and
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
doubts
of
the
moment
messire
she
began
madame
he
retorted
are
you
mere
stone
for
answer
he
lapsed
into
sudden
reflection
it
is
five
years
ago
this
junetide
he
said
since
the
king
and
the
court
came
to
gilderoy
gilderoy
you
know
the
town
madame
she
stared
back
upon
a
sudden
vision
of
the
past
a
past
gorgeous
with
the
crimson
fires
of
youth
that
junetide
she
had
worn
a
new
green
gown
a
silver
girdle
a
red
rose
in
her
hair
there
had
been
jousting
in
the
gilderoy
meadows
much
braying
of
trumpets
much
splendour
much
pomp
of
arms
she
remembered
the
scent
and
colour
of
it
all
the
blaze
of
tissues
of
gold
and
green
purple
and
azure
she
remembered
the
flickering
of
a
thousand
pennons
in
the
wind
the
fair
women
thronging
the
galleries
like
flowers
burdening
a
bowl
the
vision
came
to
her
undefiled
for
the
moment
a
calm
as
the
first
pure
pageant
of
spring
and
you
messire
she
said
with
more
colour
of
face
and
soul
rode
in
the
king
s
train
a
noble
do
i
bulk
for
a
cook
or
a
falconer
no
no
yet
you
remember
me
as
it
were
yesterday
walking
in
the
meadows
at
your
father
s
side
your
father
that
rual
who
carried
the
banner
when
the
king
s
men
stormed
gaerlent
these
forty
years
ago
not
madame
that
i
followed
that
war
i
was
a
mass
of
puking
in
a
cradle
so
we
grow
old
the
girl
s
face
had
darkened
again
on
the
instant
the
man
in
the
red
cloak
saw
her
eyes
grow
big
of
pupil
her
lips
straightened
into
a
colourless
line
she
held
her
head
high
and
stared
into
the
purple
gloom
of
the
woods
memories
were
with
her
the
present
had
an
iron
hand
upon
her
heart
time
changes
many
things
he
said
with
a
discretion
that
desired
to
soften
the
silence
we
go
from
cradle
to
throne
in
one
score
years
from
life
to
clay
in
a
moment
pay
no
homage
to
circumstance
the
wave
covers
the
rock
but
the
granite
shows
again
its
glistening
poll
when
the
water
has
fallen
a
hercules
can
strangle
fate
as
for
me
i
know
not
whether
i
have
soared
in
the
estimation
of
heaven
yet
i
can
swear
that
i
have
lost
much
of
the
vagabond
sinful
soul
that
straddled
my
shoulders
in
the
past
there
was
a
warm
ruggedness
about
the
man
a
flippant
that
touched
the
girl
s
fancy
he
was
either
a
strong
soul
or
an
utter
charlatan
posing
as
a
diogenes
she
preferred
the
former
picture
in
her
heart
and
began
to
question
him
again
with
a
species
of
picturesque
insolence
i
presume
messire
she
said
that
you
have
some
purpose
in
life
from
my
brief
dealings
with
you
i
should
deem
you
a
very
superior
footpad
i
gather
that
it
is
your
intention
to
rob
me
i
confess
that
you
seem
a
gentleman
at
the
business
the
man
of
the
red
cloak
laughed
in
his
helmet
to
be
frank
madame
he
said
you
may
dub
me
a
gatherer
of
taxes
explain
being
unfortunates
and
outcasts
from
the
lawful
ways
of
life
my
men
and
i
seek
to
remedy
the
injustice
of
the
world
by
levying
toll
on
folk
more
happy
than
ourselves
then
you
condemn
me
as
fortunate
your
defence
madame
the
girl
smiled
with
her
lips
but
her
eyes
were
hard
and
bright
as
steel
i
might
convince
you
otherwise
she
said
but
no
matter
why
should
i
be
frank
with
a
thief
even
though
he
be
nobly
born
because
madame
the
thief
may
be
of
service
to
the
lady
i
have
little
silver
for
your
wallet
am
i
nothing
but
a
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
straight
stare
her
voice
was
level
even
imperious
put
up
your
vizor
she
said
to
him
the
man
in
the
black
harness
hesitated
then
obeyed
her
she
could
see
little
of
his
face
however
save
that
it
was
bronzed
and
that
the
eyes
were
very
masterful
she
ventured
further
in
the
argument
being
bent
on
fathoming
the
baser
instincts
of
the
business
knight
of
the
red
shield
she
said
madame
i
ask
you
an
honest
question
if
you
would
serve
me
speak
the
truth
and
let
me
know
my
peril
are
you
the
lord
flavian
of
gambrevault
or
no
the
man
never
hesitated
an
instant
there
was
no
wavering
to
cast
doubt
upon
his
sincerity
or
upon
his
intelligence
as
a
liar
no
madame
he
answered
her
i
am
not
the
lord
of
gambrevault
and
avalon
and
may
i
for
the
sake
of
my
own
neck
never
come
within
his
walls
i
have
an
old
feud
with
the
lords
of
gambrevault
and
when
the
chance
comes
i
shall
settle
it
heavily
to
my
credit
if
you
have
any
ill
to
say
of
the
gentleman
pray
say
it
and
be
happy
in
my
sympathy
ha
she
said
with
a
sudden
flash
of
malice
i
would
give
my
soul
for
that
fellow
s
head
so
quoth
the
man
with
a
keen
look
that
would
be
a
most
delectable
bargain
iv
the
stems
thinned
about
them
suddenly
and
the
sky
grew
great
beyond
a
more
meagre
screen
of
boughs
to
the
west
breaking
the
canopy
with
an
edge
of
agate
rocks
towered
heavenwards
smiting
into
a
furnace
of
splendour
waves
of
light
beat
in
spray
upon
the
billowy
masses
of
the
trees
dying
in
the
east
into
a
majestic
mask
of
gloom
yeoland
and
the
man
in
red
came
forth
into
a
little
glade
hollowed
by
the
waters
of
a
pool
a
stream
a
scolloped
sheet
of
foam
stumbled
headlong
into
the
mere
vanishing
beyond
like
a
frail
white
ghost
into
the
woods
a
fire
danced
in
the
open
and
under
the
trees
stood
a
pavilion
of
red
cloth
the
man
dismounted
and
held
the
girl
s
stirrup
a
quick
glance
round
the
glade
had
shown
her
bales
of
merchandise
littering
the
green
carpet
of
the
place
horses
tethered
in
the
wood
men
moving
like
gnomes
about
the
fire
even
as
she
dismounted
streaks
of
steel
shone
out
in
the
surrounding
shadows
armed
men
streamed
in
and
piled
their
pikes
and
bills
about
the
pines
at
the
western
end
of
the
glade
a
gigantic
fir
a
forest
patriarch
stood
out
above
the
more
slender
figures
of
his
fellows
the
grotesque
roots
writhing
like
talons
tressled
a
bench
of
boughs
and
skins
before
the
tree
burnt
a
fire
the
draught
sweeping
upwards
to
fan
the
fringe
of
the
green
fir
s
gown
the
man
in
the
black
harness
took
yeoland
to
the
seat
under
the
tree
the
boughs
arched
them
like
a
canopy
and
the
wood
fire
gave
a
lusty
heat
in
the
gloaming
a
boy
had
run
forward
to
unhelm
the
knight
in
the
red
cloak
casque
and
sword
lay
on
the
bench
of
boughs
and
skins
the
girl
s
glance
framed
for
the
first
time
the
man
s
face
she
surveyed
him
at
her
leisure
under
drooping
lids
with
a
species
of
reticent
interest
that
escaped
boldness
it
was
one
of
those
incidents
to
her
that
stand
up
above
the
plain
of
life
and
build
individual
history
she
saw
a
bronzed
man
with
a
tangle
of
hair
a
great
beak
of
a
nose
and
a
hooked
chin
his
eyes
were
like
amber
darting
light
into
the
depth
of
life
alert
deep
and
masterful
there
was
a
rugged
and
indomitable
vigour
in
the
face
the
mouth
was
of
iron
yet
not
unkind
the
jaw
ponderous
the
throat
bovine
the
mask
of
youth
had
palpably
forsaken
him
life
that
great
chiseller
of
faces
had
set
her
tool
upon
his
features
moulding
them
into
a
strenuous
and
powerful
dignity
that
suited
his
soul
he
appeared
to
fathom
the
spirit
of
the
girl
s
scrutiny
nor
did
he
take
umbrage
at
the
open
and
critical
revision
of
her
glances
he
inferred
calmly
enough
that
she
considered
him
by
no
means
blemishless
in
feature
or
in
atmosphere
probably
he
had
long
passed
that
age
when
the
sanguine
bachelor
never
doubts
of
plucking
absolute
favour
from
the
eyes
of
a
woman
the
girl
was
not
wholly
enamoured
of
him
he
was
rational
enough
to
read
that
in
her
glances
madame
is
in
doubt
he
said
to
her
with
a
glimmer
of
a
smile
as
to
what
messire
my
character
you
prefer
the
truth
am
i
not
a
philosopher
hear
the
truth
then
messire
i
would
not
have
you
for
a
master
the
man
laughed
a
quiet
soundless
laugh
through
lips
there
was
something
magnetic
about
his
grizzled
and
ironical
strength
cased
in
its
shell
of
blackened
steel
he
had
the
air
of
one
who
had
learnt
to
toy
with
his
fellows
as
with
so
many
strutting
puppets
the
world
was
largely
a
stage
to
him
grotesque
at
some
seasons
strenuous
at
others
ha
a
miracle
indeed
he
said
a
woman
who
can
tell
the
truth
she
ignored
the
gibe
and
ran
on
your
name
messire
the
man
spread
his
hands
pardon
the
omission
i
am
known
as
fulviac
of
the
forest
my
heritage
i
judge
to
be
the
sword
and
the
shadows
of
these
same
wilds
yeoland
considered
him
awhile
in
silence
the
firelight
flickered
on
his
harness
glittering
on
the
ribbed
and
jointed
shoulder
plates
striking
a
golden
streak
from
the
edge
of
each
huge
pauldron
mimic
flames
burnt
red
upon
his
black
cuirass
as
in
a
darkened
mirror
the
night
framed
his
figure
in
an
aureole
of
gloom
as
he
sat
with
his
massive
head
motionless
upon
its
throat
five
years
ago
she
said
suddenly
you
rode
as
a
noble
in
the
king
s
train
now
you
declare
yourself
a
thief
these
things
do
not
harmonise
unless
you
confess
to
a
dual
self
madame
he
answered
her
i
confess
to
nothing
if
you
would
be
wise
eschew
the
past
and
consider
the
present
at
your
service
i
am
named
fulviac
and
i
am
an
outlaw
let
that
grant
you
satisfaction
yeoland
glanced
over
the
glade
walled
in
with
the
gloom
of
the
woods
the
stream
foaming
in
the
dusk
the
armed
men
gathered
about
the
further
fire
and
these
she
asked
are
mine
outcasts
also
say
no
hard
things
of
them
they
are
folk
whom
the
world
has
treated
scurvily
therefore
they
are
at
feud
with
the
world
the
times
are
out
of
joint
tyrannous
and
heavy
to
bear
the
nobles
like
millstones
grind
the
poor
into
pulp
tread
out
the
life
from
them
that
the
wine
of
pleasure
may
flow
into
gilded
chalices
the
world
is
trampled
under
foot
pride
and
greed
go
hand
in
hand
against
us
she
looked
at
him
under
her
long
lashes
with
the
zest
of
cavil
slumbering
in
her
eyes
autocracy
was
a
hereditary
right
with
her
even
though
feudalism
had
slain
her
sire
i
would
have
the
mob
held
in
check
she
said
to
him
and
how
by
cutting
off
a
man
s
ears
when
he
spits
a
stag
by
splitting
his
nose
for
some
small
sin
by
branding
beggars
who
thieve
because
their
children
starve
oh
equable
and
honest
justice
god
prevent
me
from
being
poor
she
looked
at
him
with
her
great
solemn
eyes
and
you
she
asked
he
spread
his
arms
with
a
dignity
i
madame
i
take
the
whole
world
into
my
bosom
and
play
the
christ
weeping
over
jerusalem
madame
your
wit
is
excellent
a
spit
had
been
turning
over
the
large
fire
a
haunch
of
venison
being
basted
thereon
by
a
big
man
in
the
cassock
of
a
friar
certain
of
fulviac
s
fellows
came
forward
bearing
wine
in
horns
white
bread
and
meat
upon
platters
of
wood
they
stood
and
served
the
pair
with
a
silent
and
soldierly
briskness
that
bespoke
discipline
the
girl
s
hunger
was
as
healthy
as
her
sleek
plump
neck
despite
the
day
s
hazard
and
her
homeless
peril
dusk
had
fallen
fast
the
last
pennon
of
day
shone
an
eerie
streak
of
saffron
in
the
west
the
forest
stood
wrapped
in
the
stupendous
stillness
of
the
night
an
impenetrable
curtain
of
ebony
closed
the
glade
with
its
pool
fulviac
s
servers
had
retreated
to
the
fire
where
a
ring
of
rough
faces
shone
in
the
wayward
light
the
sound
of
their
harsh
voices
came
up
to
the
pair
in
concord
with
the
perpetual
murmur
of
the
stream
yeoland
had
shaken
the
from
her
green
gown
she
was
comforted
in
the
flesh
and
ready
for
further
foining
with
the
man
who
posed
as
her
captor
sincerity
is
a
rare
virtue
she
said
with
a
slight
lifting
of
the
angles
of
her
mouth
i
can
endorse
that
dogma
do
you
pretend
to
the
same
possibly
you
love
the
poor
conceive
their
wrongs
to
be
your
own
fulviac
smiled
in
his
eyes
like
a
man
pleased
with
his
own
thoughts
have
i
not
said
as
much
well
i
revere
my
own
image
and
fame
he
commended
her
and
unbosomed
in
one
breath
pity
he
said
is
often
a
species
of
splendid
pride
we
toil
we
fight
we
labour
why
because
below
all
life
and
effort
there
burns
an
immortal
egotism
an
eternal
vanity
liberty
liberty
we
cry
liberty
and
justice
man
for
yet
how
the
soul
glows
at
the
sound
of
its
own
voice
the
human
self
hugs
fame
and
mutters
lo
what
a
god
am
i
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
v
silence
fell
between
them
for
a
season
a
silence
deep
and
intangible
as
the
darkness
of
the
woods
the
man
s
mood
had
recovered
its
subtle
calm
even
as
a
pool
that
has
been
stirred
momentarily
by
the
plashing
of
a
stone
sinks
into
rippleless
repose
he
sat
with
folded
arms
before
the
flare
of
the
fire
watching
the
girl
under
his
heavy
brows
she
was
very
fair
to
look
upon
slim
yet
spirited
as
a
band
of
steel
her
ears
shone
out
from
her
dusky
hair
like
apple
blossoms
in
a
mist
of
leaves
her
lips
were
sensitive
clean
as
the
petals
of
a
rose
her
great
grief
had
chastened
her
from
the
curve
of
her
neck
to
the
delicate
strength
of
her
white
hands
she
was
as
rich
an
idyll
as
a
man
could
desire
fulviac
considered
her
with
a
thought
that
leant
philosophically
towards
her
beauty
he
had
grown
weary
of
love
in
his
time
the
passions
of
youth
had
burnt
to
dry
ashes
possibly
he
had
been
luckless
in
his
knowledge
of
the
sex
he
had
married
a
wife
of
irreproachable
birth
a
lady
with
a
sharp
nose
and
a
lipless
mouth
eyes
of
green
and
a
most
unholy
temper
she
was
dead
had
been
dead
many
years
the
man
had
no
delirious
desire
to
meet
her
again
in
heaven
as
for
this
girl
he
had
need
of
her
for
revolutionary
reasons
and
his
mood
to
her
was
more
that
of
a
father
her
spirit
pleased
him
moreover
he
knew
what
he
knew
gazing
at
the
flames
he
spread
his
hands
to
them
and
entered
again
on
the
confines
of
debate
his
voice
had
the
steady
rhythmic
insistence
of
a
bell
pealing
a
curfew
its
tone
was
that
of
a
man
not
willing
to
be
gainsaid
therefore
madame
i
would
have
you
understand
that
i
desire
in
some
measure
to
be
a
benefactor
to
the
human
race
i
take
your
word
for
it
she
answered
him
that
i
am
an
ambitious
man
somewhat
vain
towards
fame
one
that
can
glow
in
soul
a
human
sun
so
that
loves
to
be
thought
great
through
warming
the
universe
madame
you
are
epigrammatic
or
enigmatic
messire
as
you
will
he
answered
her
your
womanhood
makes
you
an
enigma
it
is
your
birthright
understand
that
i
possess
power
fifty
tied
to
a
purse
consider
me
a
serious
figure
in
the
world
s
sum
as
you
will
messire
you
are
an
outlaw
a
leader
of
fifty
vagabonds
a
man
with
ideals
as
to
the
establishing
of
justice
you
are
going
to
subvert
the
country
very
good
i
have
learnt
my
lesson
but
how
is
all
this
going
to
help
me
out
of
the
wood
fulviac
took
his
sword
and
balanced
it
upon
his
wrist
the
red
light
from
the
fire
flashed
on
the
swaying
steel
our
hopes
are
more
near
of
kin
madame
than
you
imagine
well
flavian
of
gambrevault
s
raiders
burnt
your
home
slew
your
father
exterminated
your
brethren
this
happened
but
a
day
ago
you
do
not
love
this
flavian
of
gambrevault
her
whole
figure
stiffened
spasmodically
as
at
the
prick
of
a
sword
her
eyes
with
widely
open
pupils
flashed
up
to
fulviac
s
face
she
questioned
him
through
her
set
teeth
with
a
passionate
whisper
of
desire
how
do
you
know
this
his
face
mellowed
the
arm
bearing
the
sword
was
steady
as
the
limb
of
an
oak
i
am
wiser
in
many
ways
than
you
imagine
he
said
look
at
me
i
am
no
longer
young
i
hate
women
i
patronise
god
you
are
a
mere
child
to
you
life
is
dark
and
perilous
as
this
wilderness
of
pines
your
trouble
is
known
to
me
because
it
is
my
business
to
know
of
such
things
it
was
my
deliberate
intent
that
you
should
fall
into
my
hands
the
girl
was
still
rigidly
astonied
she
stared
at
him
mutely
with
dubious
eyes
the
man
and
his
philosophy
were
beyond
her
for
the
moment
well
she
said
to
him
with
a
quaver
of
entreaty
first
you
will
honour
me
by
saying
that
i
have
your
trust
how
may
i
promise
you
that
because
i
am
surety
for
my
own
honour
she
smiled
in
his
face
despite
the
occasion
you
seem
very
sure
of
your
own
soul
she
said
madame
it
has
taken
me
ten
years
to
come
by
so
admirable
a
state
carried
to
the
depths
builds
up
i
may
take
it
for
granted
that
you
hate
the
lord
flavian
of
gambrevault
need
you
ask
that
her
eyes
echoed
the
mood
of
the
flame
fulviac
watching
her
saw
the
strong
wrack
of
wrath
twisting
her
delicate
features
for
the
moment
into
pathetic
ugliness
you
have
courage
he
said
to
her
ample
messire
flavian
of
gambrevault
is
the
greatest
lord
in
the
south
i
am
as
wise
on
that
score
this
flavian
and
fulviac
of
the
forest
are
irreconcilable
as
day
and
night
the
man
stood
his
sword
pommel
upwards
in
the
grass
and
ran
on
some
day
i
shall
slay
this
same
flavian
of
gambrevault
his
blood
will
expiate
the
blood
of
these
your
kinsfolk
therefore
madame
you
will
be
my
debtor
that
is
all
she
asked
him
with
a
wistfulness
in
her
voice
that
was
even
piteous
fulviac
looked
long
into
the
fire
like
a
man
whose
thoughts
channel
under
the
crust
of
years
pity
for
the
girl
had
gone
to
the
heart
under
the
steel
cuirass
a
pity
that
was
not
the
pander
of
desire
his
eyes
took
a
new
meaning
into
their
keen
depths
he
looked
to
have
grown
suddenly
younger
by
some
years
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
had
lost
its
and
grandiose
confidence
it
was
the
voice
of
a
man
who
strides
generous
and
eager
into
the
breach
of
fate
listen
he
said
to
her
i
may
tell
you
that
your
sorrow
has
armed
my
manhood
give
me
my
due
i
am
more
than
a
mere
vagabond
you
have
been
cruelly
dealt
with
i
take
your
cause
upon
the
cross
of
my
sword
you
messire
even
so
i
need
a
good
woman
a
brave
woman
you
please
me
well
you
are
a
necessity
to
me
and
why
messire
for
a
matter
of
religion
and
of
justice
trust
to
my
honour
you
shall
learn
more
in
due
season
yeoland
smitten
with
incredulity
stared
at
the
man
in
mute
surmise
here
was
an
amazing
circumstance
robbery
idealised
soul
body
purse
at
one
bold
swoop
in
her
mystification
she
could
find
nothing
to
say
to
the
man
for
the
moment
even
though
he
had
promised
her
a
refuge
you
are
very
sure
of
yourself
she
said
at
length
i
am
a
man
yet
you
leave
me
in
ignorance
madame
we
are
to
undertake
great
deeds
together
great
perils
i
could
hold
up
an
astonishing
future
to
your
eyes
but
for
the
present
i
keep
silence
rest
assured
that
you
shall
be
accorded
such
honour
as
the
virgin
herself
could
desire
remember
that
i
give
you
promise
of
vengeance
and
a
home
the
girl
drew
a
deep
breath
as
though
taking
the
spirit
of
the
hour
into
her
bosom
if
i
refuse
she
said
to
him
you
can
not
refuse
came
the
level
retort
and
why
messire
your
consent
though
pleasant
is
not
necessary
in
the
matter
i
have
long
ago
determined
to
appropriate
you
to
my
ambition
vi
fulviac
s
lair
lay
deep
within
the
waving
wilderness
of
pines
above
the
spires
of
the
forest
a
massive
barrier
of
rock
thrust
up
its
rugged
bartisans
into
the
blue
east
and
west
it
stretched
a
mile
or
more
concavitated
towards
the
north
and
standing
like
a
huge
breakwater
amid
the
sea
of
boughs
the
rocky
plateau
above
was
peopled
by
pines
and
rowans
thatched
also
with
a
wild
tangle
of
briar
whin
and
heather
crannies
cleft
into
it
caves
tunnelled
its
massive
bosom
innumerable
minarets
of
stone
mingled
with
the
trees
the
cliffs
rose
like
the
walls
of
a
castle
donjon
from
the
forest
floor
studded
with
dwarf
trees
bearded
with
ferns
and
grass
the
plateau
was
inaccessible
from
the
forest
save
by
a
thin
rocky
track
where
the
western
slope
of
the
cliff
tailed
off
to
merge
into
the
trees
the
significance
of
the
place
to
fulviac
lay
in
the
existence
of
a
cavern
or
series
of
caves
piercing
the
cliff
and
opening
both
upon
the
southern
and
northern
facades
of
the
mass
a
wooden
causeway
led
to
the
southern
entry
bridging
a
small
gorge
where
a
stream
foamed
under
the
pines
the
yawn
of
the
southern
opening
had
been
built
up
with
great
blocks
of
stone
and
the
rough
walls
pierced
by
narrow
squints
and
a
gate
opening
under
a
rounded
arch
within
the
roof
of
the
main
cavern
arched
abruptly
upwards
hollowing
a
great
dome
over
the
smooth
floor
beneath
this
grotesque
and
hall
served
as
and
dormitory
a
very
various
chamber
winding
ways
smote
from
it
into
the
black
bowels
of
the
cliff
the
height
of
the
main
cavern
dwindled
as
it
tunnelled
northwards
into
the
rock
a
second
wall
of
stone
partitioned
the
from
a
second
and
smaller
chamber
lit
always
by
a
great
lamp
pendent
from
the
ceiling
a
chamber
that
served
fulviac
as
from
fulviac
s
parlour
the
cavern
narrowed
to
a
gallery
that
had
been
expanded
by
human
craft
into
a
third
and
smaller
room
this
last
rock
chamber
was
wholly
more
healthy
and
habitable
than
the
others
its
walls
stood
squarely
from
floor
to
rocky
roof
and
it
was
blessed
with
a
wide
casement
that
stared
northwards
over
a
vista
of
obeisant
trees
a
postern
gave
entry
to
the
room
from
a
narrow
platform
and
from
this
ledge
a
stairway
cut
in
the
flank
of
the
cliff
dwindled
into
the
murk
of
the
forest
below
a
more
romantic
atmosphere
had
swept
into
the
bleak
galleries
of
the
place
that
winter
plundered
stores
were
ransacked
bales
of
merchandise
ungirded
caskets
and
chests
pilfered
as
for
the
endowing
of
the
chamber
of
a
queen
the
northern
room
in
the
cliff
blossomed
into
the
rich
opulence
of
a
lady
s
bower
its
stone
walls
were
panelled
with
old
oak
carvings
taken
from
some
ancient
manor
there
were
tapestries
of
green
gold
and
purple
an
antique
bed
with
a
tester
of
silver
silk
its
flanks
blazoned
with
coloured
escutcheons

jewelled

surrendered
a
set
of
brazen
ewers
a
lute
inlaid
with
pearl
a
carpet
woven
on
the
looms
of
the
purple

there
were
mirrors
of

about

fulviac

consecrated
all
these
to

a
white

amid
a
horde
of
thistles
the
girl
s
life
had
drawn
under
the
black
shadow
of
the
cliff
and
into
the
clanging
torrent
of
these
rough
men
of
the
sword
it
was
a
wild
age
and
a
wild
region
fulviac
s
rogues
were
like
wolves
in
a
forest
lair
keen
bloody
and
relentless
there
was
a
rude
strain
of
violence
running
through
the
strenuous
mood
of
the
place
like
the
song
of
norse
rovers
piercing
the
roar
of
the
sea
mystery
enveloped
the
girl
war
and
the
sound
of
the
sword
she
fumbled
at
the
riddle
of
fate
with
the
trembling
fingers
of
one
who
unbars
a
prison
gate
in
the
hush
of
night
it
was
all
strange
and
fantastic
beyond
the
riot
of
a
dream

had
said
to
her
when
he
had
hung
a
key
at
her
girdle
i
have
bidden
you
trust
me
remember
that
i
trust
you
in
turn
take
this
room
as
your
sanctuary
lock
me
out
when
you
will
i
prepare
among
other
things
to
perfect
your
vengeance
yeoland
suffered
him
and
her
necessity
she
was
shrewdly
wise
in
the
conviction
that
it
would
be
useless
to
rebel
against
the
man
though
and
secretive
his
purpose
appeared
benignant
in
the
opulence
of
its
favour
moreover
the
forest
was
as
a
vast
web
holding
her
within
the
maze
of
the
unknown
i
have
no
alternative
she
said
to
him
i
am
in
your
power
and
yet
i
believe
you
are
no
villain
your
charity
pleases
me
i
am
a
man
with
a
strong
purpose
for
good
do
i
not
need
you
am
i
then
so
powerful
a
person
you
will
learn
anon
you
seem
something
of
a
mystic
she
said
to
him
madame
he
retorted
trust
my
discretion
in
due
season
i
shall
unfold
to
you
certain
aspects
of
life
that
will
kindle
your
sympathies
i
shall
appeal
to
the
woman
in
you
when
you
are

you
will
commend

moved
through

the
clangour
of

and
the
songs
of

bloomed
like

it
was
a
fair
age
and
very
lovely
full
of
colour
and
desire
music
and
the
odour
of
romance
and
the
poor
their
lot
hung
largely
on
the
humour
of
an
overlord
or
the
state
of
a
gentleman

stomach
they
had
their
saints

their

their

their

they
had
hovels
of
clay
and
wattle
labour
in
wind
and

plagues
and
pestilences
in
the
rotting
filth
of
their
city

they
marked
the

by
in

and
cloth
of
gold
saw
the
pomp
and
opulence
of
that
other

remembered
their
own

and
their
squealing
children
and
yet
consider
the
broad
inclinations
of
the
world
to
eat
to
be
warm
to
satisfy
the
flesh
to
ease
a
lust
to

was
no
very
vast
gulf

the

scraped
a

considered
to
be
utopian
in

that
jingling

has
made
riotous

was
shut
out
from
the

of

by
leagues
of
woodland

and

the
great
pine
forest
girded
it
in
its
inmost
bosom
no
wayfarers
rode
that
way
no
huntsman
ranged
so
deep
the
place
had
an
evil
rumour
many
whom
it

welcomed
had
never
returned
romancers
had
sung
of
it
the
lay
of
guingamor
horror
ruled
over
its
hills
its
gloomy
depths
solitude
abode
there
as
over
a
primÃ¦val
sea
and
there
was
no
sound
save
the
moan
or
of
the
wind
over
its
troubled
trees
according
to
legend
lore
romulus
peopled
rome
with
the
offscourings
of
italy
fulviac
had
emulated
the
device
with
the
of
a
strong
conspirator
the
forest
stood
a
grand
accomplice
abetting
him
with
its
myriad
sentinels
who
gossiped
solely
with
the
wind
the
venture
had
been
finely
conceived
finely
edificated

men
not
a
vast
power
on
the
face
of
it
to

or
to
shake

throne
superficialities
were
fallacious
the
surface
false
and
fair
as
glistening

hid
more
than
a
company
of
ruffians
banded
together
to
resist
tyranny
enthusiasm
genius
vigour
such
torches
like
a
burning
hovel
can
fling
a
city
into
flame
as
for
the
girl
yeoland
she
was
more
than
mocked
by
the
swift
vagaries
of
life
two
days
of
mordant
realism
had
erased
from
her
heart
the
dream
visions
of
childhood
to
be
declared
homeless
kinless
in
one
day
to
be
bereft
of
liberty
the
next
to
what
end
she
stared
round
the
room
into
which
fate
had
thrust
her
fingered
the
lute
gazed
at
her
own
face
in
the
steel
mirrors
she
was
the
same
woman
yet
how
differently
circumstanced
fulviac
s
mood
had
not
hinted
at
love
or
at
any
meaner
jest
what
power
could
he
prophesy
to
his
advantage
in
the
mere
fairness
of
her
face
what
was
the
gall
of
a
woman
s
vengeance
to
a
man
who
had
conceived
the
downfall
of
a
kingdom
her
knowledge
of
psychology
was
rustic
in
the
extreme
and
she
had
no
wit
for
the
unravelling
of
fulviac
s
subtleties
there
were
certain
convictions
however
that
abode
with
her
even
in
her
ignorance
she
could
have
taken
oath
that
he
was
no
mere
swashbuckler
no
captain
of
outlaws
no
mere
spoiler
of
men
moreover
she
believed
him
to
be
the
possessor
of
some
honour
and
a
large
guerdon
of
virility
lastly
pity
appealed
her
as
a
sentiment
not
to
be
discarded
the
man
whoever
he
might
be
appeared
desirous
of
putting
his
broad
shoulders
betwixt
her
and
the
world
fulviac
grew
perspicuous
sooner
than
she
could
have
prophesied
he
had
a
fine
way
with
him
that
seemed
to
ignore
the
of
common
circumspection
he
had
wit
enough
also
to
impose
his
trust
on
others
with
a
certain
graceful
confidence
that
carried
bribery
in
the
very
generosity
of
its
hardiness
march
was
upon
them
like
a
spirit
of
discord
wild
riotous
weather
with
the
wind
thundering
like
upon
the
cliff
the
pines
were
buffeting
each
other
in
the
forest
and
reeling
beneath
the
scourgings
of
the
breeze
fulviac
came
to
the
girl
one
windy
noon
when
the
caverns
were
full
of
the
breath
of
the
storm
his
manner
to
her
seemed
as
a
significant
prelude
heralding
the
deep
utterance
of
some
human
epic
fulviac
took
the
girl
by
a
winding
stair
leading
from
the
a
stair
that
circled
upwards
in
the
thickness
of
the
rock
some
hundred
steps
or
more
and
opened
into
a
pit
on
the
plateau
above
dwarf
trees
and
briars
domed
the
hollow
giving
vision
of
a
grey
and
hurrying
sky
the
pair
climbed
a
second
stair
that
led
to
a
rock
perched
like
a
pulpit
on
the
margin
of
the
southern
precipice
the
wind
swept
gusty
and
tempestuous
over
the
cliff
it
tossed
back
the
girl
s
hood
made
her
stagger
she
would
have
fallen
had
not
fulviac
gripped
her
arm
below
stretched
an
interminable
waste
of
trees
of
bowing
and
dishevelled
boughs
the
dull
green
of
the
forest
merged
into
the
grey
of
the
sky
on
either
hand
the
craggy
bulwarks
of
the
cliffs
stretched
east
and
west
its
natural
bartisans
and
battlements
topped
by
a
cornice
of
mysterious
pines
it
was
a
superb
scene
rich
with
a
wild
liberty
stirred
by
the
wizard
chanting
of
the
wind
fulviac
watched
the
girl
as
she
stood
limned
against
the
grey
curtain
of
the
sky
her
hair
blew
about
her
white
throat
and
shoulders
in
sombre
streams
her
eyes
were
very
bright
under
their
dusky
lashes
and
the
wind
had
kissed
a
stronger
colour
into
her
cheeks
she
was
clad
in
a
kirtle
of
cloth
bound
about
the
waist
with
a
girdle
of
silver
a
white
kerchief
lay
like
snow
over
her
shoulders
and
bosom
her
green
sleeves
were
slashed
and
puffed
with
crimson
wild
country
he
said
looking
in
her
eyes
wild
as
the
sea
you
are
a
romanticist
she
gave
a
curt
laugh
after
what
i
have
suffered
romance
and
sorrow
go
hand
in
hand
for
the
moment
my
words
are
more
material
you
see
this
cliff
she
turned
to
him
and
stood
watching
his
face
this
cliff
is
the
core
of
a
kingdom
a
granite
wedge
to
hurl
feudalism
to
ruins
to
topple
tyranny
she
nodded
slowly
with
a
grave
you
have
hinted
that
you
are
ambitious
she
said
ambition
would
have
stormed
heaven
and
your
ladder
the
man
made
a
strong
gesture
like
one
who
points
a
squadron
to
the
charge
his
eyes
shone
with
a
glint
of
grimness
under
his
shaggy
brows
the
rabid
discontent
of
the
poor
fermenting
ever
under
the
crust
of
custom
the
hate
of
the
toiler
for
the
fop
and
the
fool
the
iron
that
lies
under
the
rusting
injustice
of
riches
the
of
a
people
s
vengeance
against
the
tyrant
and
the
torturer
yeoland
solemn
of
face
groped
diligently
amid
her
surmises
the
man
was
a
visionary
by
his
own
showing
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
him
for
a
fool
like
all
beings
of
uncommon
power
he
combined
imagination
with
that
huge
vigour
of
mind
that
moves
the
world
a
vast
element
of
strength
lay
coiled
in
him
subtle
yet
overpowering
as
the
body
of
some
great
reptile
the
girl
felt
the
gradual
magic
of
his
might
mesmerising
her
with
the
inevitableness
of
its
approach
you
have
brought
me
here
she
asked
him
as
i
promised
well
to
tell
you
something
of
the
truth
she
looked
at
him
with
a
penetrating
frankness
that
was
in
spirit
laudatory
you
put
great
trust
in
me
she
said
that
i
may
trust
the
more
he
sat
himself
down
on
a
ledge
of
rock
and
proceeded
to
parade
before
her
imagination
such
visions
as
were
well
conceived
to
daze
the
reason
of
a
girl
taken
fresh
from
a
forest
hermitage
he
spoke
of
riot
revolution
and
revenge
painted
utopias
established
beneath
the
benediction
of
a
just
personal
tyranny
a
country
purged
of
oppression
a
kingdom
cleansed
of
pride
he
told
of
arms
stored
in
the
warrens
of
the
cliff
of
grain
and
salted
meat
sufficient
for
an
army
he
pointed
out
the
vast
strength
of
the
place
the
plateau
approachable
only
by
the
stairway
in
the
cliff
and
the
narrow
causeway
towards
the
west
he
described
it
as
sufficient
for
the
gathering
and
massing
of
a
great
host
finally
he
swept
his
hand
over
the
leagues
of
forestland
dark
as
the
sea
isleting
the
place
from
the
ken
of
the
world
you
understand
me
he
said
to
her
she
nodded
and
waited
with
closed
lips
he
gazed
at
the
horizon
and
spoke
in
parables
the
king
and
the
nobles
are
throned
upon
a
pile
of
brushwood
a
torch
is
plunged
beneath
a
tempest
scourges

immersed
in

won
nothing
from
him
as
to
the
purpose
of
their
ride
they
were
for
gilderoy
thus
much
he
vouchsafed
her
and
no
more
she
had
a
shrewd
belief
that
he
was
for
giving
her
tangible
evidence
of
the
hazardous
schemes
that
were
fermenting
under
the
surface
of
silence

that

to

she
asked

broke
their
ride
to
pass
the
night
at
a
wayside
hostelry
where
the
road
from
gambrevault
skirted
the
forest
holding
on
at

good
leisure

curled
downhill

out

carved
stairways

sweaty
deity
of

and
gridiron
took
the
keys
from
his
girdle
and
a
lantern
from
a
niche
in
the
wall
going
at
a
wheezy
shuffle
he
led
them
by
a
long
passage
and
two
circles
of
stairs
to
a
cellar
packed
with
hogsheads
tuns
and
great
vats
of
copper
from
the
first
cellar
a
second
opened
from
the
second
a
third
in
the
last
vault
jean
rolled
a
cask
from
a
corner
turned
a
flagstone
on
its
side
showed
them
a
narrow
stairway
descending
into
the
dark
fulviac
took
the
lantern
made
a
sign
to
jean
and
passed
down
the
stairway
with
yeoland
at
his
heels
the
remained
above
in
the
cellar
and
closed
the
stone
when
the
last
gleam
of
the
light
had
died
down
the
stair
he
rolled
the
cask
back
into
its
place
and
felt
his
way
back
by
cellar
and
stairway
to
the
benignant
glow
of
his
own
tavern
room
fulviac
and
the
girl
had
descended
the
black
well
of
the
stair
tunnels
of
gloom
ran
labyrinthine
on
every
hand
a
musty
scent
burdened
the
air
and
fine
sand
covered
the
floor
fulviac
held
the
lantern
took
yeoland
s
wrist
and
moved
forward
into
a
great
gallery
that
sloped
downwards
into
the
depths
of
the
rock
the
place
was
silent
as
the
of
a
pyramid
the
lantern
fashioned
fantastic
shadows
from
the
gloom
yeoland
held
close
to
the
man
with
an
instinct
towards
trust
that
made
her
smile
at
her
own
thoughts
fulviac
had
been
in
her
life
little
more
than
a
week
yet
his
unequivocating
strength
had
won
largely
upon
her
liking
in
no
sentimental
sense
indeed
but
rather
with
the
calm
command
of
power
possibly
she
feared
him
a
very
little
yet
with
the
despair
of
a
wrecked
mariner
she
clung
to
him
in
spirit
as
she
would
have
clung
to
a
rock
as
they
passed
down
the
gallery
with
the
lantern
swinging
in
fulviac
s
hand
she
began
to
question
him
with
a
quiet
persistence
what
place
is
this
she
said
for
retort
fulviac
pointed
her
to
the
wall
and
held
the
lantern
to
aid
her
scrutiny
the
girl
saw
numberless
recesses
excavated
in
the
rock
some
had
been
bricked
up
and
bore
tablets
others
were
packed
with
grinning
skulls
there
were
scattered
paintings
on
the
walls
symbolic
daubs
or
scenes
from
scriptural
history
the
place
was
meaningless
to
the
girl
save
that
the
dead
seemed
ever
with
them
fulviac
smiled
at
her
solemn
face
the
catacombs
of
the
city
of
gilderoy
he
said
yonder
are
the
niches
of
the
dead
these
paintings
were
made
by
early
folk
centuries
ago
a
veritable
maze
this
a
gallery
of
skulls
a
warren
for
ghosts
to
squeak
in
yeoland
had
turned
to
scan
a
tablet
on
the
wall
we
go
to
some
secret
gathering
she
asked
fulviac
laughed
the
sound
echoed
through
the
passages
with
reverberating
scorn
the
same
dark
fable
he
said
telling
of
vaults
and
secret
stairs
passwords
and
poniards
masks
and
murder
remember
little
sister
you
are
to
be
black
and
subtle
to
the
heart
s

this
is
life
not
a
romance
or
an
italian
fable
we
are
men
here
there
is
to
be
no
strutting
on
the
stage
the
girl
loitered
a
moment
as
though
her
feet
kept
pace
with
her
cogitations
i
am
content
she
said
provided
i
may
eschew
poison
nor
need
run
a
bodkin
under
some
wretch
s
ribs
be
at
peace
on
that
score
i
have
not
the
heart
to
make
a
rosamund
of
you
sudden
out
of
a
dark
like
a
rat
out
of
a
hole
a
man
sprang
at
them
and
held
a
knife
at
fulviac
s
throat
the
mock
merchant
gave
the
password
with
great
unconcern
putting
his
cap
of
sables
back
from
off
his
face
the
sentinel
crossed
himself
fell
on
one
knee
and
gave
them
passage
turning
a
bluff
buttress
of
stone
they
came
abruptly
upon
a
short
gallery
that
widened
into
a
great
circular
chamber
pillared
after
the
manner
of
a
church
a
flare
of
torches
harassed
the
shadowy
vault
and
played
upon
a
thousand
upturned
faces
that
seemed
to
surge
wave
on
wave
out
of
the
gloom
in
the
centre
of
the
crypt
stood
an
altar
of
black
marble
and
before
it
on
the
dais
a
priest
with
a
cowl
down
a
rough
wooden
crucifix
in
his
hand
a
knot
of
men
in
armour
gleamed
about
the
altar
ringing
a
clear
space
about
the
steps
others
with
drawn
swords
kept
the
entries
of
the
galleries
leading
to
the
cavern
a
great
quiet
hung
over
the
place
a
silence
solid
as
the
rock
above
a
group
of
armed
men
waited
for
fulviac
at
the
main
entry
to
the
crypt
he
merged
into
their
ranks
exchanging
signs
and
words
in
an
undertone
with
one
who
seemed
in
authority
the
ring
of
figures
pressed
through
the
crowd
towards
the
altar
fulviac
and
yeoland
in
their
midst
fulviac
mounted
the
steps
and
drew
the
girl
up
beside
him
he
uncovered
his
face
to
the
mob
with
the
gesture
of
a
king
uncovering
to
his
people
fulviac
fulviac
the
press
swayed
suddenly
like
the
black
waters
of
a
lake
stirred
by
the
rush
of
flood
water
through
a
broken
dam
the
ring
of
armed
men
gave
up
the
shout
with
a
sweeping
of
swords
and
a
clangour
of
harness
the
great
cavern
took
up
the
cry
reverberating
it
from
its
thundering
vault
a
thousand
hands
were
thrust
up
as
of
the
dead
rising
from
the
sea
yeoland
watched
the
man
s
face
with
a
mute
kindling
of
enthusiasm
as
she
gazed
it
beaconed
forth
a
new
dignity
to
her
that
she
had
never
seen
thereon
before
a
sudden
grandeur
of
strength
glowed
from
its
features
the
mouth
and
jaw
seemed
of
iron
the
eyes
were
full
of
a
stormy
fire
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
transfigured
throned
above
himself
on
the
burning
pinnacle
of
power
he
towered
above
the
mob
like
some
granite
god
colossal
in
strength
colossal
in
courage
his
manhood
flamed
out
a
to
the
world
as
the
cry
dwindled
the
priest
who
still
kept
his
cowl
down
over
his
face
held
his
crucifix
on
high
and
broke
into
the
strident
cadence
of
a
rebel
ballad
the
people
followed
as
by
instinct
knowing
the
song
of
old
many
hundred
voices
gathered
strenuously
into
the
flood
the
massed
roar
rolling
through
the
great
crypt
echoing
along
the
galleries
like
the
sound
of
some
subterranean
stream
it
was
a
deep
chant
and
a
stirring
strong
with
the
strength
of
the
storm
wind
fanatic
as
the
sea
the
silence
that
fell
at
the
end
thereof
was
the
more
solemn
in
contrast
to
the
thundering
stanzas
of
the
hymn
under
the
flare
of
the
torches
fulviac
stood
forward
to
turn
the
task
from
the
crucifix
to
the
sword
men
of
gilderoy
a
billow
of
cheering
dashed
again
to
the
roof
fulviac
fulviac
the
man
suffered
the
cry
to
die
into
utter
silence
before
leaping
into
a
riot
of
words
a
harangue
that
had
more
justification
in
it
than
appeal
his
voice
filled
the
cavern
with
its
volume
and
depth
it
was
more
the
voice
of
a
captain
thundering
commands
to
a
squadron
of
horse
than
the
declamatory
craft
of
the
orator
fulviac
knew
the
mob
that
they
were
rough
and
turbulent
and
loved
a
demagogue
scholastic
subtleties
could
never
fill
their

well
as

even
the

about

vociferous
and
eager
torches
rocked
to

leapt
grotesquely
gigantic
over

further
and

fuel
for
the

at
a

from
him
the
circle
of
armed
men
parted
two
peasants
stumbled
forward
bearing
a
cripple
in
their
arms
they
carried
him
up
the
steps
and
set
him
upon
the
altar
before
all
the
people
supporting
him
as
he
stared
round
upon
the
sea
of
faces
he
was
a
shrivelled
being
yellow
black
of
eye
cadaverous
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
wallowed
for
years
among
toads
in
a
pit
and
had
become
as
one
of
them
his
voice
was
cracked
and
querulous
as
he
brandished
a
claw
of
a
hand
and
screamed
at
the
crowd

a

rushed
from
the

fat
and
bloated

climbed
the

stretched
out
her

kind
of

fulviac
s
pageant
gathered
grimly
before
the
mob
a
blind
man
tottered
up
and
pointed
to
his
sightless
eyes
a
girl
held
up
an
infant
and
told
shrilly
of
its
father
s
murder
one
fellow
displayed
a
tongueless
mouth
another
a
face
distorted
by
the
iron
a
third
had
lost
nose
and
ears
a
fourth
showed
arms
shrivelled
and
contracted
by
fire
it
was
a
sinister
appeal
strong
yet
piteous
the
tyranny
of
the
age
showed
in
the
bodies
of
these
wronged
and
mutilated
beings
they
had
been
mere
carrion
tossed
under
the
iron
heel
of
power
the
granite
car
of
ruthless
opulence
and
passion
had
crushed
them
under
its
reddened
wheels
at
a
gesture
from
fulviac
the
priest
upon
the
steps
threw
back
his
cowl
and
stood
forward
in
the
torchlight
his
face
was
the
face
of
a
zealot
fanatical
sanguine
lined
with
an
energy
that
was
prophetic
of
power
his
eyes
smouldered
under
their
straight
black
brows
his
hands
white
and
bony
quivered
as
he
stretched
them
out
towards
the
people
they
knew
him
on
the
instant
their
clamour
told
as
much
often
had
the
shadow
of
that
thin
figure
fallen
athwart
the
parched
highways
of
stricken
cities
often
had
those
hands
tended
death
those
lips
smitten
awe
into
the
souls
of
the
drunkard
and
the
harlot
prosper
prosper
the
preacher
there
rang
a
rude
rough
joy
in
the
clamour
that
was
spontaneous
and
eloquent
it
was
the
heart
s
cry
of
the
people
wild
trusting
and
passionate
men
and
women
broke
through
the
circle
of
armed
men
cast
themselves
upon
the

steps
kissed
the
friar
s
gown
and
fawned
on
him
he
put
them
back
with
a
certain
awkward
dignity
and
a
hot
colour
upon
his
almost
boyish
face
the
man
had
a
fine
humility
though
the
strenuous
ideals
of
his
soul
ran
in
fire
to
the
zenith
anon
he
signed
a
benediction
and
a
hush
descended
on
the
place

peace
to
you

of
gilderoy
the
clamour
revived

the

the

stretched
forth
his

his

rang
strong
and
strident
over
the
packed
upturned

of

we
not
seen
enough
to
scourge

the
crypt
thundered
to
him
when
he
lowered
his
hands
it
was
the
cry
of
men
bankrupt
of
liberty
thirsty
for
revenge
fulviac
grappled
the
climax
and
stood
forward
with
uplifted
sword
his
lion

sounded
above
the

the

left
by

their

burning
solitary
in

fulviac
had
the
air
of
a
man
whose

hawk
had
flown
with
fettle
and
brought
her
quarry
tumbling
out

labyrinthine
passages
strange

they
passed
together
from
the
dark
deeps
of
the
catacombs
at
one
point
the
roof
shone
silvered
as
with
dew
and
the

stood
damp
as
in
a
marsh
on
a
winter
s
eve
the
river
tamar
flowed
above
them
in
its
rocky
bed
so
fulviac
told
the

anon
they
came
out
by
a
narrow
stair
that
opened
by
a
throat
into
a
thicket
of
old
oaks
in
the
gilderoy
meadows
the
stairhead
was
covered
by
a
species
of
stone
trap
that
could
be
covered
and
concealed
by
sods
in
the
thicket
a
man
awaited
them
with
the
bridles
of
three
horses
over
his

fulviac
held
yeoland

and
they
rode
out
the

swam
in

amid
a
shower
of

gilderoy
with
its
climbing

stood
out
white
under

the

gleamed
like

in
the
magic
glow
in
the
meadows
the
ringlets
of
the
river
glimmered
far
and
distant
rose
the
nebulous
midnight
of
the
woods
fulviac
had
bared
his
head
to
an
inconstant
and
torpid
breeze
they
were
riding
for
the
west
along
a
bridle
track
that
curled
grey
and
dim
through
the
sombre
meadows
the
calm
soundless
vault
of
the
world
rose
now
in
contrast
to
the
canopies
of
stone
and
the
of
the
catacombs
human
moil
and
effort
seemed
infinitely
little
under
the
eternal
scrutiny
of
the
stars
so
thought
the
man
for
the
moment
as
he
rode
with
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
breast
watching
keenly
the
girl
at
his
side
yeoland
was
young
all
the
roses
of
youth
were
budding
about
her
soul
idealism
like
the
essence
of
crushed
violets
hovered
heavy
over
the
world
her
soul
as
yet
was
no
frayed
and
listless
lute
thrummed
into
discords
by
the
bony
hand
of
care
she
was
built
for
love
a
temple
of
white
marble
lit
by
lamps
of
rubeous
glory
colours
flashed
through
the
red
sanctuaries
of
the
flesh
yet
pain
and
great
woe
had
smitten
her
the
grim
destinies
of
earth
seemed
bent
on
thrusting
an
innocent
pilgrim
into
the
turbulent
contradictions
of
life
the
pageant
in
the
catacombs
that
night
had
stirred
her
strangely
beyond
belief
the
fantastic
faces
the
zeal
the
hot
words
of
gesturing
enthusiasm
these
were
things
new
to
her
therefore
the
more
vivid
and
convincing
new
worlds
new
passions
seemed
to
burst
into
being
under
the
stars
she
was
utterly
silent
as
she
rode
looking
forth
into
the
night
her
hood
had
fallen
back
her
face
shone
white
and
clear
her
eyes
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
fulviac
like
a
who
had
evolved
some
subtle
scheme
rode
and
watched
her
with
a
smile
deep
in
his
eyes
for
the
moment
he
was
content
to
leave
her
to
the
magic
of
her
own
thoughts
at
certain
rare
seasons
in
life
virgin
light
floods
down
into
the
heart
as
from
some
oriel
opened
in
heaven
the
world
stands
under
a
grander
scheme
of
chiaroscuro
men
comprehend
where
they
once
scoffed
it
was
thus
that
yeoland
rose
inspired
like
a
spiritual
venus
from
a
sea
of
dreams
as
molten
glass
is
shaped
speedily
into
fair
and
exquisite
device
so
the
red
wax
of
her
heart
had
taken
the
impress
of
the
hour
gilderoy
had
stirred
her
like
a
blazoned
page
of
romance
fulviac
caught
the
girl
s
half
glance
at
him
read
in
measure
the
meaning
of
her
mood
her
lips
were
half
parted
as
though
she
had
words
upon
her
tongue
but
still
hesitated
from
some
scruple
of
pride
he
straightened
in
the
saddle
and
waited
for
her
to
unbosom
to
him
with
a
confident
reserve
well
he
said
at
length
since
she
still
lingered
in
her
silence
how
much
one
may
learn
in
a
day
she
answered
drawing
her
white
palfrey
nearer
to
his
horse
fulviac
agreed
with
her
the
man
on
the
end
of
the
rope
he
said
learns
in
two
minutes
that
which
has
puzzled
philosophers
since
adam
loved
eve
she
turned
to
him
with
an
eagerness
that
was
almost
passionate
even
in
its
suppressed
vigour
how
long
was
it
before
you
came
to
pity
your
fellows
some
minutes
not
more
and
the
conversion
shall
satisfy
you
one
day
for
the
present
i
will
buckle
up
so
unsavoury
a
fable
in
my
bosom
tell
me
what
you
have
learnt
at
gilderoy
yeoland
looked
at
the
moon
the
man
saw
great
sadness
upon
her
face
but
also
an
inspired
radiance
that
made
its
very
beauty
the
more
remarkable
he
foresaw
in
an
instant
that
they
were
coming
to
deeper
matters
superficialities
the
mannerisms
of
life
were
falling
away
the
girl
s
heart
beat
near
to
his
he
felt
a
luminous
sympathy
of
spirit
rise
round
them
like
the
gold
of
a
byzantine
background
come
he
said
with
a
burst
of
beneficence
you
are
beginning
to
understand
me
she
jerked
a
swift
glance
at
him
like
the
look
of
a
falcon
you
are
a
man
for
all
your
sneers
and
vapourings
i
had
a
heart
once
call
me
an
oak
broken
twisted
aged
but
an
oak
still
yeoland
drew
quite
close
to
him
so
that
her
skirt
almost
brushed
his
horse
s
flank
fulviac
s
shadow
fell
athwart
her
only
her
face
shone
clear
in
the
moonlight
i
have
ceased
she
said
to
look
upon
life
as
a
stretch
of
blue
a
laughing
dawn
good
i
have
learnt
that
woe
is
the
crown
of
years
good
again
that
life
is
full
of
violence
and
wrong
a
platitude
yes
life
consists
in
learning
platitudes
i
am
only
one
woman
among
thousands
a
revelation
you
jeer
not
so
few
women
learn
the
truth
of
your
proverb
lastly
my
trouble
is
not
the
only
woe
in
the
world
that
it
is
an
error
to
close
up
grief
in
the
casket
of
self
fulviac
flapped
his
bridle
and
looked
far
ahead
into
the
cavern
of
the
night
he
was
silent
awhile
in
thought
when
he
spoke
again
he
delivered
himself
of
certain
curt
cogitations
characteristic
confessions
that
were
wholly
logical
i
am
a
selfish
vagabond
he
said
i
appeal
to
peter
s
keys
whether
all
ambition
is
not
selfish
i
am
an
egotist
for
the
good
of
others
the
stronger
my
ambition
the
stronger
the
hope
of
the
land
in
generous
justice
i
live
to
rule
to
rule
magnanimously
yet
with
an
iron
sceptre
there
you
have
my
creed
and
god
she
asked
him
is
a
most
useful
subordinate
you
do
not
mean
that
i
do
not
she
saw
again
the
mutilated
beings
in
the
catacombs
aye
even
her
own
home
flaming
to
the
sky
and
the
white
face
of
her
dead
father
faith
and
devotion
were
great
in
her
for
the
moment
divine
vengeance
beaconed
over
the
world
a
torch
borne
aloft
by
the
hand
of
pity
it
is
god
s
war
she
said
to
him
with
a
finer
solemnity
sounding
in
her
voice
you
have
stirred
the
woman
in
me
is
that
enough
enough
he
answered
her
and
the
rest
god
shall
make
all
plain
in
due
season
gilderoy
had
dwindled
into
the
east
its
castle
s
towers
still
netted
the
moonlight
from
afar
the
meadowlands
had
ceased
and
trees
strode
down
in
multitudes
to
guard
the
track
the
night
was
still
and
calm
with
a
whisper
of
frost
in
the
crisp
sparkling
air
the
world
seemed
roofed
with
a
dome
of
dusky
steel
before
them
a
shallow
valley
lay
white
in
the
light
of
the
moon
around
climbed
the
glimmering
turrets
of
the
trees
rank
on
rank
solemn
and
tumultuous
the
bare
gable
ends
of
a
ruined
chapel
rose
in
the
valley
fulviac
drew
aside
by
a
bridle
path
that
ran
amid
rushes
to
the
left
from
the
broken
wall
of
the
curtilage
a
great
beech
wood
ascended
its
boughs
black
against
the
sky
its
floor
with
fallen
leaves
the
chapel
stood
roofless
under
the
moon
hollies
a
sable
barrier
that
glistened
in
the
moonlight
closed
the
ruin
on
the
south
yews
cast
their
gloom
about
the
walls
a
tall
cross
in
the
forsaken
graveyard
stretched
out
its
mossy
arms
east
and
west
the
armed
groom
took
the
horses
and
tethered
them
under
a
clump
of
pines
by
the
wall
fulviac
and
the
girl
yeoland
passed
up
through
weeds
and
brambles
to
the
porch
a
great
briar
rose
had
tangled
the
opening
with
a
thorny
web
as
though
to
hold
the
ruin
from
the
hand
of
man
the
tiled
floor
was
choked
with
grass
a
rickety
door
drooped
rotten
on
its
rusty
hinges
fulviac
pushed
through
and
beckoned
the
girl
to
follow
within
all
was
ruinous
and
desolate
the
roof
fallen
the
casements
broken
we
must
find
harbour
here
said
the
man
our
horses
go
far
a
cheerful
hostel
this
its
wildness
makes
it
safe
you
fear
the
cold
i
ll
see
to
that
no
i
am
hungry
the
high
altar
still
stood
below
the
small
rose
window
in
the
east
where
the
rotting
fragments
of
a
triptych
hid
the
stonework
there
was
a
great
carved
screen
of
stone
on
either
side
curiously
recessed
as
though
giving
access
to
an
ambulatory
the
altar
stood
in
dense
shadow
with
broken
timber
and
a
tangle
of
briars
ringing
a
barrier
about
its
steps
on
the
southern
side
of
the
nave
a
patch
of
tiled
flooring
still
stood
riftless
closed
in
by
two
fallen
pillars
the
groom
came
in
with
two
and
fulviac
spread
them
on
the
tiles
he
also
gave
her
a
small
flask
of
wine
and
a
silver
pyx
holding
meat
and
bread
we
crusaders
must
not
grumble
at
the
rough
lodging
he
said
to
her
wrap
yourself
in
these
cloaks
and
play
the
jacob
with
a
stone
pillow
she
smiled
slightly
in
her
eyes
the
groom
brought
in
a
saddle
ranged
it
with
a
saddle
cloth
covering
it
that
it
might
rest
her
head
and
you
she
said
to
fulviac
damian
and
i
hold
the
porch
you
will
be
cold
i
have
a
thick
hide
the
lady
of
geraint
give
you
good
rest
he
threaded
his
way
out
amid
the
fallen
stones
and
pillars
and
closed
the
rickety
gate
the
groom
a
tall
fellow
in
a
battered
bassinet
and
a
frayed
brigantine
stood
by
the
yew
trees
as
on
guard
fulviac
gestured
to
him
the
man
moved
away
towards
the
eastern
end
of
the
chapel
where
laurels
grew
thick
and
lusty
about
the
walls
when
he
returned
fulviac
was
sitting
hunched
on
a
fallen
stone
in
the
corner
of
the
porch
as
though
for
sleep
the
man
dropped
a
guttural
message
into
his
master
s
ear
and
propped
himself
in
the
other
angle
of
the
porch
an
hour
passed
the
moon
swam
past
the
zenith
towards
the
west
a
vast
quiet
watched
over
the
world
and
no
wind
rippled
in
the
woods
in
the
sky
the
stars
shivered
and
gathered
more
closely
their
silver
robes
in
the
curtilage
the
ruined
tombs
stared
white
and
desolate
at
the
moon
an
owl
s
cry
sounded
in
the
woods
sudden
and
strange
as
though
dropped
from
the
stars
faint
music
quivered
on
the
air
it
gathered
died
grew
again
with
a
mysterious
flux
of
sweetness
as
of
some
song
stealing
from
the
gardens
of
the
dead
flute
cithern
and
viol
were
sounding
under
the
moon
merging
a
wizard
chant
into
the
magic
of
the
hour
angels
in
green
attire
seemed
to
descend
the
burning
stair
of
heaven
a
sudden
great
radiance
lit
the
ruin
a
glory
of
gold
streaming
from
the
altar
cymbals
clashed
waves
of
shimmering
light
surged
over
the
broken
walls
incense
like
purple
smoke
curled
through
the
casements
the
music
rushed
in
clamorous
rapture
to
the
stars
a
voice
was
heard
crying
in
the
chapel
elfin
and
wild
yet
full
of
a
vague
rich
sanctity
it
ceased
sudden
as
the
brief
moan
of
a
prophecy
the
golden
glow
elapsed
the
music
sank
to
silence
nought
save
the
moonlight
poured
in
silver
omnipotence
over
the
ruin
from
the
chapel
came
the
sound
of
stumbling
footsteps
amid
the
stones
a
hand
clutched
at
the
rotting
door
jerked
it
open
as
in
terror
the
girl
yeoland
came
out
into
the
porch
and
stood
swaying
in
the
shadow
fulviac
her
voice
was
hoarse
and
whispering
strained
as
the
overwrought
strings
of
a
lute
the
man
did
not
stir
she
bent
down
dragged
at
his
cloak
calling
to
him
with
a
quick
and
gathering
vehemence
he
shook
himself
as
from
the
thongs
of
sleep
stood
up
and
stared
at
her
the
groom
still
crouched
in
the
dark
corner
fulviac
she
thrust
her
way
through
the
briars
into
the
moonlight
her
hood
had
fallen
back
her
hair
loose
upon
her
shoulders
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
supernatural
stupor
and
she
seemed
under
the
spell
of
some
great
shock
of
awe
she
trembled
so
greatly
that
fulviac
followed
her
and
held
her
arm
speak
what
has
chanced
to
you
she
still
shook
like
some
flower
breathed
upon
by
the
oracular
voice
of
god
her
hands
were
torn
and
bloody
from
the
thorns
the
virgin
has
appeared
to
me
are
you
mad
the
virgin
some
ghost
or
phantom
no
no
hear
me
she
stretched
out
her
hands
like
one
smitten
blind
and
took
breath
swiftly
in
sudden
gasps
hear
me
i
was
but
asleep
woke
and
heard
music
the
virgin
came
out
upon
the
altar
her
face
like
the
moon
her
robes
white
as
the
stars
there
was
great
light
great
glory
and
she
spoke
to
me
mother
of
god
what
am
i
that
i
should
be
chosen
thus
speak
can
this
be
true
the
truth
the
truth
fulviac
fell
on
his
knees
with
a
great
gesture
of
awe
the
girl
her
face
turned
to
the
moon
stood
quivering
like
a
reed
her
lips
moving
as
if
in
prayer
her
message
child
ah
it
was
this
go
forth
a
virgin
and
lead
the
hosts
of
the
fulviac
s
face
was
in
shadow
he
thrust
up
his
hands
to
the
heavens
but
would
not
so
much
as
glance
at
the
girl
above
him
his
voice
rang
out
in
the
silence
of
the
night

golden
crown
of
the
christian
subtle
alchemy
of
the
mind
how
the
balance
of
belief
swings
between
these
twain
a
spiritual
conception
born
in
a
woman
s
brain
is
as
a
savour
of
rich
spices
sweetening
all
the
world
how
great
a
power
of
obstinacy
stirs
in
one
small
body
a
pillar
of
fire
a
shining
grail
she
will
bring
forth
the
finest
gems
that
hang
upon
her
bosom
the
ruby
of
heroism
the
sapphire
of
pity
she
will
cast
all
her
store
of
gold
into
the
lap
of
fate
give
to
her
some
radiant
dream
of
hope
and
she
may
prove
the
most
splendid
idealist
even
if
she
do
not
prove
a
wise
one
remember
the
women
who
watched
about
the
cross
of
christ
there
had
been
trickery
in
the
miracle
a
tinge
of
flesh
in
the
vision
the
virgin
in
the
ruck
of
religion
had
suffered
herself
to
be
personated
by
a
clever
little
player
from
gilderoy
aided
and
idealised
by
a
certain
notorious
charlatan
who
dealt
in
magic
was
not
above
aiding
ecclesiastical
mummeries
on
occasions
and
conspiring
for
the
solemn
production
of
miracles
a
priest
s
juggling
box
a
secret
door
at
the
back
of
the
altar
used
in
bygone
days
for
the
manipulation
of
a
image
musicians
incense
and
greek
fire
these
had
made
the
portent
possible
as
for
fulviac
rugged
plotter
he
was
as
grave
as
an
abbot
over
the
business
his
words
were
wondrous
beatific
he
spoke
of
the
interventions
of
heaven
with
bated
breath
it
was
a
superstitious
age
touched
with
phantasy
and
gemmed
with
magic
relics
were
casketed
in
gold
and
silver
holy
blood
amazed
with
yearly
liquefactions
the
souls
of
the
devout
dreamers
gazed
into
mirrors
crystals
for
visions
of
heaven
jewels
were
poured
in
scintillant
streams
at
the
white
feet
of
the
madonna
it
was
all
done
with
rare
mysticism
colour
and
rich
music
the
moon
ruled
marriage
corn
and
kine
the
saints
like
a
concourse
of
angels
walked
with
melancholy
splendour
through
the
wilds
as
for
the
girl
yeoland
she
had
the
heart
of
a
woman
in
the
noblest
measure
a
red
heart
pure
yet
passionate
the
world
waxed
prophetic
that
shrill
season
she
was
as
full
of
dreams
and
phantasies
as
an
astrologer
s
missal
nothing
amazed
her
and
yet
all
earth
was
mysterious
the
wind
spoke
in
magic
syllables
the
trees
were
oracular
the
stars
white
hands
tracing
symbols
in
the
sky
she
was
borne
above
herself
on
the
pinions
of
ecstasy
heard
seraph
wings
sweep
the
air
saw
the
glimmer
of
their
robes
passing
the
portals
of
the
night
mysticism
moved
through
the
world
like
the
sound
of
lutes
over
a
moonlit
sea
one
march
morning
fulviac
came
to
her
in
the
northern
chamber
of
the
cliff
yeoland
had
masses
of
scarlet
cloth
and
threads
of
gold
upon
her
knees
for
she
was
broidering
a
banner
the
banner
of
the
maid
of
gilderoy
her
eyes
were
full
of
violet
shadow
she
wore
a
cross
over
her
bosom
emeralds
set
in
silver
a
rosary
dangling
on
her
wrist
told
how
her
prayers
kept
alternate
rhythm
with
her
fingers
fulviac
crooked
the
knee
to
the
crucifix
upon
the
wall
sat
down
near
her
on
a
rich
bench
of
carved
cedar
wood
the
man
was
in
a
beneficent
mood
and
beamed
on
her
like
a
lusty
summer
he
had
tidings
on
his
tongue
tidings
that
he
hoarded
with
the
craft
of
an
epicure
it
was
easy
to
mark
when
the
world
trundled
well
with
his
humour
he
put
forth
smiles
like
a
great
oak
whose
boughs
glisten
in
the
sun
you
will
tire
yourself
little
sister
she
looked
at
him
with
one
of
her
solemn
glances
a
glance
that
spoke
of
vigils
and
prayer
my
fingers
tire
before
my
heart
she
said
to
him
rest
rest
do
i
seem
weary
to
you
nay
you
are
fresh
as
the
dawn
he
brushed
back
the
tawny
hair
from
off
his
forehead
and
the
lines
about
his
mouth
softened
i
have
news
from
the
west
ah
we
gather
and
spread
like
fire
in
a
forest
the
mountain
men
are
with
us
ready
to
roll
down
from
the
hills
with
hauberk
and
sword
in
two
months
malgo
will
have
sent
the
bloody
cross
through
all
the
west
the
golden
thread
ran
through
the
girl
s
white
fingers
the
beads
of
her
rosary
rattled
she
seemed
to
be
weaving
the
destiny
of
a
kingdom
into
the
device
upon
her
banner
how
is
it
with
us
here
she
asked
him
i
have
a
thousand
stout
men
and
true
camped
upon
the
cliff
levies
are
coming
in
fast
like
steel
to
a
magnet
in
a
month
we
shall
outbulk
a
roman
legion
and
gilderoy
gilderoy
and
geraint
will
give
us
a
score
thousand
pikemen
the
stars
fight
for
us
fulviac
took
her
lute
from
the
carved
bench
and
began
to
thrum
the
chords
of
an
old
song
spears
crash
and
swords
clang
fame
maddens
the
world
come
battle
and
love
iseult
ah
iseult
he
broke
away
with
a
last
snap
at
the
strings
and
set
the
lute
aside
bear
with
me
he
said
her
dark
eyes
questioned
him
over
her
banner
i
offer
you
the
first
victim
ah
flavian
of
gambrevault
an
indefinite
shadow
descended
upon
the
girl
s
face
the
inspired
radiance
seemed
dimmed
for
the
moment
the
crude
realism
of
her
thoughts
rang
in
discord
to
her
dreams
she
lost
the
glimmering
thread
from
her
needle
her
hands
trembled
a
little
as
she
played
with
the
scarlet
folds
of
the
banner
well
a
lad
of
mine
bears
news
a
rogue
from
the
hills
of
carlyath
sharp
as
a
sword
s
point
quaint
as
an
elf
i
sent
him
gleaning
and
he
has
done
bravely
you
would
hear
his
tale
from
his
own
lips
she
nodded
and
seemed
distraught
yes
bring
him
in
to
me
she
said
fulviac
left
her
to
return
with
a
slim
youth
sidling
in
behind
him
like
a
shadow
the
lad
had
a
skin
and
ruddy
cheeks
a
pair
of
twinkling
eyes
a
thatch
of
black
hair
over
his
forehead
bred
amid
the
hills
of
carlyath
where
the
women
were
scarlet
eves
and
the
land
a
paradise
he
had
served
in
gilderoy
as
apprentice
to
an
armourer
carlyath
s
wilds
and
the
city
s
roguery
had
mingled
in
him
fantastic
strains
of
extravagant
sentiment
and
cunning
half
urchin
half
elf
he
stood
with
bent
knees
and
slouched
shoulders
his
black
eyes
alert
on
fulviac
his
lord
the
man
thrust
him
forward
by
the
collar
with
an
eloquent
gesture
the
whole
tale
try
your
wit
the
carlyath
lad
advanced
one
foot
and
with
an
impudent
southern
smirk
remarked
this
madame
is
an
infatuated
world
thus
sententiously
delivered
he
plunged
into
a
declamation
with
a
picturesque
and
fanciful
extravagance
that
he
had
imbibed
from
the
strolling
romancers
of
his
own
land
in
the
city
of
gilderoy
he
said
speaking
very
volubly
and
with
many
gestures
there
lives
a
lady
of
surpassing
comeliness
her
eyes
are
as
the
sky
her
cheeks
as
june
roses
her
hair
a
web
of
gold
she
is
a
right
fair
lady
and
daily
she
sits
at
her
broad
casement
singing
and
plaiting
her
hair
into
shackles
of
gold
she
has
bound
the
lord
flavian
of
gambrevault
in
a
net
starred
with
poppies
scarlet
poppies
of
the
field
so
that
he
ever
dreams
dreams
of
scarlet
and
sees
visions
of
lips
warm
as
wine
daily
the
lord
flavian
scours
the
country
between
avalon
and
the
fair
city
of
gilderoy
till
the
very
dust
complains
of
his
fury
and
the
green
grass
curses
his
horse
s
heels
but
the
lady
with
the
hair
of
gold
compasses
him
like
the
sunset
she
has
stolen
the
eyes
of
heaven
and
the
stars
are
blind
fulviac
smiled
over
the
extreme
subtlety
of
the
rendering
it
was
a
delicate
matter
delicately
handled
the
carlyath
lad
had
wit
and
a
most
seraphic
tongue
what
more
there
is
yet
another
lady
at
avalon
well
a
lady
whose
name
is
duessa
a
lady
with
black
hair
and
a
blacker
temper
lord
flavian
has
a
huge
horror
of
her
tongue
therefore
he
rides
like
a
thief
without
trumpets
to
gilderoy
yet
more
the
lad
spread
his
hands
with
an
inimitable
gesture
shrugged
and
heaved
a
most
christian
sigh
the
lady
duessa
is
the
lord
flavian
s
wife
he
said
surely
therefore
sire
he
is
a
coward
the
lad
drew
back
with
a
bow
and
a
scrape
of
the
foot
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
floor
with
the
discretion
of
a
veteran
lackey
at
a
sign
from
fulviac
he
slipped
away
and
left
yeoland
and
the
man
alone
the
girl
s
hands
were
idle
in
her
lap
the
great
scarlet
banner
trailed
in
rich
folds
about
her
feet
there
was
a
white
mask
of
thought
upon
her
face
and
her
eyes
searched
the
distance
with
an
oblivious
stare
all
the
strong
discords
of
the
past
rushed
clamorous
to
her
brain
her
consecrated
dreams
were
as
so
many
angels
startled
by
the
assaults
of
hell
she
rose
from
her
chair
cast
the
casement
wide
and
stood
gazing
over
the
forest
youth
seemed
in
the
breeze
and
the
clear
voice
of
the
spring
the
green
woods
surged
with
liberty
the
strong
zest
of
life
breathed
in
their
bosoms
in
the
distance
the
pines
seemed
to
beckon
to
her
to
wave
their
caps
in
windy
exultation
fulviac
had
stood
watching
her
with
the
calm
scrutiny
of
one
wise
in
the
passionate
workings
of
the
soul
he
suffered
her
to
possess
her
thoughts
in
silence
for
a
season
to
come
by
a
steady
comprehension
of
the
past
presently
he
gathered
the
red
banner
and
hung
it
on
the
frame
went
softly
to
her
and
touched
her
sleeve
shall
they
kill
him
on
the
road
he
asked
she
pondered
a
moment
and
did
not
answer
him
it
is
easy
he
said
and
a
matter
of
sheer
justice
the
words
seemed
to
steel
her
decision
no
she
said
let
them
bring
him
here
to
me
so
be
it
he
answered
her
fulviac
found
her
cold
and
taciturn
desirous
of
solitude
he
humoured
the
mood
and
she
was
still
staring
from
the
window
when
he
left
her
the
woodland
had
melted
before
her
into
an
oblivious
mist
in
its
stead
she
saw
a
tower
flaming
amid
naked
trees
a
white
face
staring
heavenwards
with
the
marble
tranquillity
of
death
x
down
through
the
woods
of
avalon
rode
the
lord
flavian
of
gambrevault
down
towards
the
forest
track
in
the
grey
face
of
the
dawn
in
the
meadows
and
beyond
the
orchards
water
shone
and
towers
stood
mistily
the
voice
of
spring
pulsed
in
the
air
songs
of
green
woods
the
wild
wine
of
violets
pavements
of
primrose
gold
birds
piped
lustily
in
wood
and
thicket
and
the
ascending
sun
lavished
his
glittering
archery
from
the
chariots
of
the
clouds
the
lord
flavian
was
inordinately
cheerful
that
morning
as
he
rode
in
green
and
red
through
the
prophetic
woods
heart
and
weather
were
in
kindred
keeping
and
his
youth
sang
like
a
brook
after
april
rains
the
woods
danced
in
dew
far
on
its
rocky
hill
the
towers
of
gilderoy
would
soon
beckon
him
above
the
trees
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
tower
stood
a
gabled
house
with
gilded
vanes
and
roofs
of
generous
red
there
in
gilderoy
in
a
room
hung
with
cloth
of
purple
and
gold
white
arms
waited
and
the
bosom
of
a
golden
helen
held
love
like
a
red
rose
in
a
pool
of
milky
spikenard
picture
a
slim
but
muscular
man
with
the
virile
figure
of
a
young
david
a
keen
smooth
face
a
halo
of
brown
hair
eyes
eloquent
as
a
woman
s
picture
a
good
grey
horse
trapped
in
red
and
green
full
of
fettle
as
a
colt
burly
as
a
bull
picture
the
ermined
borderings
the
jewelled
clasps
brigantine
of
quilted
velvet
bassinet
bright
as
a
star
youth
clean
adventurous
aglow
to
the
last
impetuous
to
the
tune
of
thirty
breaths
a
minute
youth
with
all
its
splendid
waywardness
its
generosities
its
immense
youth
with
the
voice
of
a
golden
summer
in
its
heart
and
for
its
plume
the
gorgeous
fires
of
eve
wealth
often
breeds
apathy
and
parsimonious
instincts
it
is
the
beggar
whose
purse
bursts
with
joy
whose
soul
blazes
generous
red
upon
the
clouds
as
for
flavian
of
gambrevault
and
avalon
he
was
rich
but
no
miser
proud
yet
not
haughty
sanguine
but
not
vicious
like
many
a
man
inspired
by
an
instinctive
idealism
his
heart
ran
before
his
reason
they
not
having
come
cheek
by
jowl
as
in
later
years
he
was
very
devout
yet
very
worldly
very
ardent
yet
over
hasty
mark
him
then
a
lovable
fool
in
the
eyes
of
philosophy
a
cup
of
mingled
wine
both
white
and
red
he
was
a
great
lord
yet
his
serfs
loved
him
the
lady
duessa
s
parents
good
folk
had
been
blessed
with
aspirations
gambrevault
and
avalon
had
bulked
very
gloriously
under
the
vault
of
pride
moreover
their
daughter
was
a
sensuous
being
who
panted
for
poetic
surroundings
and
lived
to
music
a
boy
of
twenty
a
passionate
houri
of
twenty
and
five

book
and

such
had
been
the
bridal
bargain
consummated
on

principles
five
years
ago
or
more
a
youth
of
twenty
is
not
supremely
wise
concerning
the
world
or
his
own
heart
the
lord
flavian
s
marriage
had
not
proved
a
magic
blessing
to
him
parentally
sealed
marriage
deeds
are
the
edicts
of
the
devil
quickly
are
the
mighty
fallen
and
the
chalices
of
love
broken
it
was
no
mere
chance
ambuscade
that
waited
for
flavian
lord
of
gambrevault
and
avalon
warden
of
the
southern
marches
knight
of
the
order
of
the
rose
as
he
rode
that
morning
to
gilderoy
a
disciple
of
venus
in
a
certain
perilous
place
the
road
ran
betwixt
walls
of
rock
and
under
the
umbrage
of
overhanging
trees
twenty
men
with
pike
and
gisarme
swarming
out
of
the
woods
a
short
scuffle
and
a
stabbed
horse
a
gag
in
the
mouth
a
bandage
over
the
eyes
a
mule
s
back
half
a
dozen
thongs
of
stout
leather
that
same
evening
the
lord
flavian
was
brought
like
a
bale
of
merchandise
into
fulviac
s
and
tumbled
on
a
heap
of
straw
in
a
corner
they
were
grim
men
these
forest
rangers
not
given
to
pity
or
the
light
handling
of
a
feud
a
poniard
point
was
their
pet
oath
a
whip
of
the
sword
the
best
word
with
an
enemy
they
bit
their
thumb
nails
at
creation
and
were
not
gentle
in
the
quest
of
a
creed
fulviac
heard
their
news
and
commended
them
they
were
like
the
ogres
of
the
old
fables
the
red
blood
of
a
lusty
aristocrat
smelt
fresh
for
the
sword
s
supper
the
girl
yeoland
was
at
her
with
a
blazoned
breviary
under
her
fingers
when
fulviac
came
to
her
with
tidings
of
the
day
s
capture
she
knelt
with
her
hands
crossed
upon
her
bosom
as
fulviac
stood
in
the
darkened
doorway
to
the
man
she
appeared
as
the
madonna
in
some
picture
of
the
annunciation
the
yellow
light
from
the
lamp
streaming
down
upon
her
with
a
lustre
of
sanctity
they
have
brought
the
boar
home
dead
nay
but
his
corpse
candle
walks
the
cavern
for
the
girl
it
was
a
descent
from
spiritual
themes
to
the
stark
realism
of
life
she
left
her
with
a
little
sigh
her
hands
trembled
as
she
drew
a
scarlet
cloak
about
her
and
fastened
it
with
a
girdle
of
green
leather
her
eyes
dwelt
on
fulviac
s
face
with
a
species
of
dusky
pain
come
he
said
to
her
whither
to
judge
him
not
before
all
not
in
the
leave
it
to
me
he
said
be
forewarned
we
deal
with
no
mere
swashbuckler
they
went
together
to
fulviac
s
parlour
where
a
great
brazen
lamp
hung
from
the
roof
and
a
book
bound
in
black
leather
lay
chained
on
the
table
yeoland
took
the
man
s
carved
chair
while
he
stood
behind
her
leaning
on
the
rail
she
was
paler
than
was
her
wont
now
and
again
she
pressed
a
hand
to
her
breast
as
though
to
stay
the
too
rapid
beating
of
her
heart
two
guards
bearing
partisans
came
in
from
the
with
a
man
bound
and
blindfold
between
them
a
third
followed
bearing
a
sword
naked
over
his
shoulder
he
was
known
as
nord
of
the
hammer
an
armourer
like
to
a
norse
volund
burly
strong
as
a
bear
the
door
was
barred
upon
them
one
of
the
guards
plucked
the
cloth
from
the
bound
man
s
face
in
the
malicious
imagery
of
thought
yeoland
had
often
pictured
to
herself
this
flavian
of
gambrevault
a
coarse
florid
ruffian
burly
and
brutal
a
fleshly
demigod
in
the
world
of
feudalism
so
much
for
conjecture
what
she
beheld
was
a
man
slim
as
a
cypress
supple
as
good
steel
the
face
was
young
yet
strong
the
grey
eyes
clear
and
fearless
moreover
there
was
a
certain
lonely
look
about
him
that
invoked
pity
and
angered
her
in
an
enigmatic
way
she
was
wrath
with
him
for
being
what
he
was
for
contradicting
the
previous
imaginings
of
her
mind
flavian
of
gambrevault
stood
bound
before
her
an
aristocrat
of
aristocrats
outraged
in
pride
yet
proud
beyond
complaint
the
of
his
breeding
kept
him
a
stately
figure
despite
his
tumbling
and
his
youth
one
convinced
of
lordship
and
the
powerful
splendour
of
his
name
the
whole
affair
to
him
was
illogical
preposterous
insolent
a
gentleman
of
the
best
blood
in
the
kingdom
could
not
be
hustled
out
of
his
dignity
by
the
of
a
bevy
of
possibly
the
first
vision
to
snare
the
man
s
glance
was
the
elfin
loveliness
of
the
girl
who
sat
throned
in
the
great
chair
as
on
a
judgment
seat
he
marked
the
beauty
of
her
skin
her
sapphire
eyes
gleaming
black
in
certain
lights
her
ebon
hair
bound
with
a
fillet
of
leather
moreover
it
was
plain
to
the
man
in
turn
that
this
damoisel
in
the
red
gown
was
deciphering
his
features
in
turn
with
a
curiosity
that
was
no
vapid
virtue
as
for
fulviac
he
watched
them
both
with
his
eyes
eyes
that
missed
no
movement
in
the
mask
of
life
to
him
the
scene
under
the
great
brazen
lamp
was
a
study
in
moods
and
emotions
the
aristocrat
was
the
first
to
defy
the
silence
he
had
stared
round
the
room
at
his
leisure
and
at
each
of
its
motionless
figures
in
turn
the
great
sword
slanted
in
gleaming
nakedness
over
nord
s
shoulder
appeared
to
fascinate
him
for
the
moment
despite
his
ambiguous
sanctity
he
showed
no
badge
of
panic
or
distress
ignoring
the
woman
he
challenged
fulviac
who
leant
upon
the
chair
rail
watching
him
with
an
enigmatic
smile
goodman
in
the
red
doublet
quoth
he
when
you
have
stared
your
fill
at
me
i
will
ask
you
to
read
me
the
moral
of
this
fable
fulviac
stroked
his
chin
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
holds
an
adversary
at
some
subtle
disadvantage
messire
he
said
address
yourself
to
madame
here
you
are
her
affair
in
the
main
the
warden
of
the
southern
marches
bowed
as
by
habit
his
grey
eyes
reverted
to
yeoland
s
face
searching
it
with
a
certain
courteous
curiosity
that
took
her
beauty
for
its
justification
the
woman
was
an
enigma
to
him
a
most
magical
sphinx
whose
riddle
taunted
his
reason
madame
he
began
the
girl
stiffened
in
her
chair
at
the
word
you
hold
me
at
a
disadvantage
seeing
that
i
am
ignorant
of
sin
or
indiscretion
against
you
if
it
is
a
question
of
gold
messire
he
swept
her
exclamation
suavely
aside
and
ran
on
mellifluously
if
it
is
a
question
of
gold
let
me
beseech
you
to
be
frank
with
me
i
will
covenant
with
you
instanter
my
seneschal
at
gambrevault
will
unbolt
my
coffers
and
ease
your
greed
pray
be
outspoken
i
will
renounce
the
delight
of
lodging
here
for
a
purse
of
good
rose
nobles
there
was
the
faintest
tinge
of
insolence
in
the
man
s
voice
an
insolence
that
exaggerated
to
the
full
the
charge
of
plunder
in
his
words
whether
he
hinted
at
blood
money
or
no
there
was
sufficient
poison
in
the
sneer
to
fire
the
brain
and
scorch
the
heart
to
vengeance
the
woman
had
risen
from
her
chair
and
stood
gripping
the
carved
woodwork
with
a
passion
that
set
her
arms
quivering
like
bands
of
tightened
steel
the
calm
had
melted
from
her
face
wrath
ran
riot
in
her
blood
so
large
were
her
pupils
that
her
eyes
gleamed
red
ha
messire
i
bring
you
to
justice
and
you
offer
me
gold
the
man
stared
his
eyes
did
not
quail
from
hers
justice
madame
of
what
sin
then
am
i
accused
on
my
soul
i
know
not
who
you
are
she
calmed
herself
a
little
shook
back
her
hair
from
her
shoulders
fingered
her
throat
breathing
fast
the
while
my
name
messire
ha
you
shall
have
it
i
am
yeoland
daughter
of
that
rual
of
cambremont
whom
you
slaughtered
at
the
gate
of
his
burning
house
i
am
the
sister
of
those
fair
sons
whom
you
did
to
death
blood
money
forsooth
god
grant
messire
that
you
are
in
honest
mind
for
heaven
for
you
die
the
man
had
bent
to
catch
her
words
he
straightened
suddenly
like
a
tree
whose
throat
is
loosed
from
the
grim
grip
of
the
wind
he
went
grey
as
granite
flushed
red
again
as
a
dishonoured
girl
the
words
had
touched
him
with
the
iron
of
truth
hear
me
he
said
to
her
ah
you
would
lie
by
heaven
no
give
me
an
hour
s
justice
murderer
before
god
you
wrong
me
he
stood
with
twitching
lips
shackled
hands
twisting
one
within
the
other
for
the
instant
words
eluded
him
like
fruit
jerked
from
the
mouth
of
a
tantalus
anon
his
manhood
gathered
in
him
rushed
forth
redly
like
blood
from
a
stricken
throat
daughter
of
rual
hear
me
i
tell
you
the
truth
i
flavian
of
gambrevault
had
in
my
pay
a
company
of
hired
spears
rough
devils
from
the
north
the
braggarts
served
me
against
john
of
brissac
were
half
their
service
drunk
and
mutinous
when
lententide
had
come
their
captain
swore
to
me
lording
pay
us
and
let
us
go
we
have
spilt
blood
near
gilderoy
scullion
blood
he
swore
give
us
good
bounty
and
let
us
so
at
his
word
i
gave
them
largesse
and
packed
them
from
gambrevault
with
pennons
flying
methought
they
and
their
brawlings
were
at
an
end
before
god
and
the
saints
i
never
knew
of
this
yeoland
considered
him
strenuous
as
he
seemed
towards
truth
he
was
young
passionate
sanguine
for
one
short
moment
she
pitied
him
and
pondered
his
innocence
in
her
heart
it
was
then
that
fulviac
plucked
at
her
sleeve
spoke
in
her
ear
words
that
hardened
her
like
a
winter
frost
she
stared
in
the
man
s
eyes
as
she
gave
him
his
with
the
sureness
of
hate
blood
for
blood
were
her
words
to
him
is
this
justice
i
have
spoken
monstrously
hear
me
messire
make
your
peace
with
heaven
i
give
you
till
daylight
the
man
stumbled
against
the
table
white
as
the
moon
youth
strove
in
him
the
crimson
fountain
of
life
s
wine
the
wild
cry
of
the
dawn
his
eyes
were
great
with
a
superhuman
hunger
fulviac
s
strong
voice
answered
him
hence
hence
at
dawn
nord
do
your
duty
xi
give
doubt
the
password
and
the
outer
battlements
are
traitorously
stormed
parley
with
pity
and
the
white
banner
flutters
on
the
keep
provided
her
emotions
inspire
her
a
woman
is
strong
let
her
take
to
logic
and
she
is
a
rushlight
wavering
in
the
wind
in
her
red
heart
lies
her
divinity
her
feet
are
of
clay
when
reason
rules
her
head
the
girl
yeoland
took
doubt
to
her
chamber
that
night
a
malicious
sprite
sharp
of
wit
and
wild
of
eye
all
the
demons
of
discord
were
loosed
in
the
silence
of
the
night
pandora
s
box
stood
open
and
the
hours
were
void
of
sleep
faces
crowded
the
shadows
voices
wailed
in
the
gloom
her
thoughts
rioted
like
frightened
bats
fluttering
and
squeaking
round
a
torch
sleep
like
a
pale
cassandra
stood
aloof
and
watched
the
mask
of
these
manifold
emotions
turn
and
twist
as
she
would
amid
her
fevered
pillows
a
wild
voice
haunted
her
importunate
and
piteous
as
the
cry
of
one
sinking
in
a
stormy
sea
it
rang
out
with
a
passionate
vehemence
moreover
there
was
a
subtle
echo
in
her
own
heart
a
strong
appeal
that
did
not
spare
her
toss
and
struggle
as
she
would
decision
fluttered
like
a
wounded
bird
malevolence
rushed
back
as
an
ocean
billow
from
the
bastion
of
a
cliff
that
emblemed
mercy
with
a
beating
of
wings
and
a
discordant
clamour
a
buffeted
the
casement
a
lamp
still
burnt
beneath
the
crucifix
the
glow
had
beaconed
the
bird
out
of
the
night
starting
up
with
a
shiver
of
fear
she
quenched
the
lamp
and
crept
back
to
bed
the
darkness
seemed
to
smother
her
like
a
cloak
the
silence
took
to
ghostly
whisperings
a
clicked
against
the
wall
the
night
crawled
on
like
a
funeral
cortÃ¨ge
baffled
outfaced
sleepless
she
rose
from
her
tumbled
bed
and
paced
the
room
as
in
a
fever
still
wakefulness
and
a
thousand
dishevelled
thoughts
that
hung
about
her
like
her
snoodless
hair
again
and
again
she
heard
the
distant
whirr
and
rattle
of
wheels
the
clangour
of
the
wire
as
the
antique
clock
in
fulviac
s
chamber
smote
away
the
hours
of
night
each
echo
of
the
sound
seemed
to
spur
to
the
quick
her
wavering
resolution
time
was
flying
jostling
her
thoughts
as
in
a
mill
race
with
the
dawn
the
lord
flavian
would
die
anon
she
flung
the
casement
wide
and
stared
out
into
the
night
a
calm
breeze
moved
amid
the
masses
of
ivy
and
played
upon
her
face
she
bared
her
breast
to
its
breath
and
stood
motionless
with
head
thrown
back
her
white
throat
glimmering
amid
her
hair
below
the
sombre
multitudes
of
the
trees
showed
dim
and
ghostly
deep
with
mystery
a
vague
wind
stirred
the
branches
the
dark
void
swirled
with
unrest
breaking
like
a
midnight
sea
upon
a
cliff
a
few
straggling
stars
peeped
through
the
lattice
of
the
sky
she
leant
against
the
sill
rested
her
chin
upon
her
palms
and
brooded
thoughts
fierce
passionate
and
clamorous
came
crying
like
gusts
of
wind
through
a
ruined
house
death
and
dead
faces
blood
the
yawn
of
sepulchres
life
and
the
joy
of
it
all
these
passed
as
visions
of
fire
before
her
fancy
vengeance
and
pity
agonised
her
soul
she
answered
yea
and
nay
with
the
same
breath
condemned
and
pardoned
with
contradicting
zeal
youth
lifted
up
its
face
to
her
piteous
and
beautiful
death
reached
out
a
rattling
hand
into
her
bosom
presently
a
far
glow
began
to
creep
into
the
sky
a
gradual
greyness
absorbed
the
shadows
of
the
night
the
day
was
dawning
from
the
forest
the
trembling
orisons
of
the
birds
thrilled
like
golden
light
into
the
air
unutterable
joy
seemed
to
flood
forth
from
the
piping
throats
even
the
trees
seemed
to
quiver
to
the
sound
with
a
rush
of
bitter
passion
she
closed
the
casement
cast
herself
upon
her
bed
and
strove
to
pray
again
came
the
impotent
groping
into
nothingness
a
dense
mist
seemed
to
rise
betwixt
her
soul
and
the
white
face
of
the
madonna
aspiration
lessened
like
an
afterglow
and
dissolved
away
into
a
dark
void
of
doubt
prayer
eluded
her
the
utterances
of
her
heart
died
in
a
miserable
endeavour
and
she
could
not
think
the
spiritual
storm
wore
itself
away
as
the
dawn
streamed
in
with
a
glimmer
of
gold
yeoland
lay
and
stared
at
the
casement
and
the
figure
of
sebastian
rendered
radiant
by
the
dawn
the
whiteness
of
his
limbs
tongued
with
dusky
rills
of
blood
where
the
barbs
had
smitten
into
the
flesh
sombre
were
the
eyes
and
shadowy
with
suffering
a
halo
of
gold
gilded
the
youthful
face
the
painted
glass
about
him
blazed
like
a
shower
of
gems
the
sebastian
of
the
casement
recalled
to
her
with
wizard
power
the
face
of
the
man
whom
death
claimed
at
dawn
the
thought
woke
no
new
passion
in
her
the
night
s
vigil
had
left
her
reason
like
a
skein
of
tangled
silk
and
with
the
day
she
verged
towards
a
wearied
apathy
the
voice
of
pity
in
her
waned
to
an
infrequent
whisper
that
came
like
the
rustling
of
leaves
on
a
summer
night
she
realised
that
it
had
dawned
an
hour
or
more
that
the
man
had
knelt
and
fallen
to
nord
s
sword
suddenly
the
silence
was
snapped
by
a
far
outcry
sounding
in
the
bowels
of
the
cliff
gruff
voices
seemed
to
echo
and
like
breakers
in
a
cavern
a
horn
blared
she
heard
the
thudding
of
a
door
the
shrilling
of
mail
the
clangour
of
iron
steps
passing
up
the
gallery
shivering
she
raised
herself
upon
her
elbow
to
listen
were
they
bringing
her
the
man
s
head
grey
and
with
closed
lids
and
mangled
neck
she
fell
back
again
upon
her
pillows
pressed
her
hands
to
her
face
with
a
great
revulsion
of
pity
for
the
image
had
burnt
in
upon
her
brain
the
clangour
of
harness
drew
near
with
an
iron
rhythm
as
of
the
march
of
destiny
it
ceased
outside
the
door
a
heavy
hand
beat
upon
the
panelling
who
knocks
her
own
voice
strained
and
shrill
startled
her
like
an
owl
s
hoot
fulviac
s
deep
bass
answered
her
from
the
passage
unbar
to
me
i
must
speak
with
you
she
started
up
from
the
bed
in
passionless
haste
ran
to
a
closet
drew
out
a
cloak
and
wrapped
it
about
her
shoulders
her
bare
feet
showed
white
under
her
as
she
slid
the
bolt
from
its
socket
and
let
the
man
in
he
was
fully
armed
save
for
his
salade
which
he
carried
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
his
red
cloak
swept
his
heels
a
tower
of
steel
there
was
a
clangorous
bluster
about
him
that
bespoke
action
the
girl
had
drawn
apart
shivering
and
gathering
her
cloak
about
her
for
in
the
gloom
of
the
place
she
had
thought
for
an
instant
that
fulviac
carried
a
mangled
head
a
rider
has
brought
news
he
said
to
her
john
of
brissac
s
men
have
taken
prosper
the
preacher
to
hang
him
as
their
lord
has
vowed
over
the
gate
of
fontenaye
they
are
on
the
march
home
from
gilderoy
ten
lances
and
a
company
of
arbalestiers
i
ride
to
ambuscado
them
prosper
shall
not
hang
she
stood
with
her
back
to
the
casement
and
looked
at
him
with
a
restless
stare
her
thoughts
were
with
the
man
whose
grey
eyes
had
pleaded
with
her
through
the
night
her
fears
clamoured
like
captives
at
the
gate
of
a
dungeon
what
is
more
this
vagabond
of
avalon
has
been
begging
twelve
hours
grace
to
scrape
his
soul
clean
for
peter
ah
she
said
with
a
sudden
stark
earnestness
i
will
give
him
till
sunset
if
i
suffer
it
the
dog
has
spirit
i
would
thrust
no
man
into
the
dark
till
he
has
struck
a
bargain
with
his
own
particular
saints
she
drew
back
sank
down
into
a
chair
with
her
hair
half
hiding
her
face
you
are
right
in
being
merciful
she
said
very
slowly
magic
riddle
of
life
rare
roseate
rod
of
love
was
it
youth
leaping
towards
youth
the
cry
of
the
lark
to
the
dawn
the
crimson
flowering
of
a
woman
s
pity
the
air
seemed
woven
through
with
gold
a
thousand
lutes
had
sounded
in
the
woods
voiceless
she
sat
with
flickering
lids
amazed
at
the
alchemy
that
had
wrought
ruth
out
of
hate
fulviac
had
drawn
back
into
the
gloom
of
the
gallery
he
turned
suddenly
upon
his
heel
and
his
scabbard
smote
and
rang
against
the
rock
i
take
all
the
men
i
have
he
said
to
her
even
the
dotard
jaspar
for
he
knows
the
ways
gregory
and
adrian
i
leave
on
guard
they
are
tough
gentlemen
and
loyal
as
for
the
lordling
he
is
well
shackled
yeoland
was
still
cowering
in
her
chair
with
the
mysterious
passions
of
the
moment
you
will
return
she
asked
him
by
nightfall
if
we
prosper
as
we
shall
he
moved
two
paces
stayed
again
in
his
stride
and
flung
a
last
message
to
her
from
the
black
throat
of
the
passage
remember
there
is
no
recantation
over
this
business
the
man
is
my
affair
as
well
as
yours
he
is
a
power
in
the
south
and
would
menace
us
remember
he
must
die
he
turned
and
left
her
without
more
palaver
she
heard
him
go
clanging
down
the
gallery
heard
the
thunder
of
a
heavy
door
the
braying
of
a
horn
a
long
while
she
sat
motionless
still
as
stone
her
hands
lying
idle
in
her
lap
when
an
hour
had
passed
the
sun
smote
in
and
found
her
kneeling
at
her
her
breviary
dewed
with
tears
xii
fulviac
passed
away
that
morning
into
the
forest
a
shaft
of
red
amid
the
mournful
glooms
colour
and
steel
streamed
after
him
fantastically
the
great
cliff
silent
and
desolate
basked
like
a
leviathan
in
the
sun
of
the
daylight
and
its
crown
of
gold
the
girl
yeoland
had
no
deep
joy
when
she
had
ended
her
passion
over
the
blazoned
pages
of
her
breviary
and
mopped
her
tears
with
a
corner
of
her
gown
she
rose
to
realism
and
turned
her
mood
to
the
cheating
of
the
dues
of
time
the
hours
lagged
with
enough
monotony
to
degenerate
a
saint
yeoland
was
very
much
a
woman
the
night
had
left
her
a
legacy
of
evil
she
had
shadows
under
her
eyes
and
a
constant
swirl
of
thoughts
within
her
brain
that
made
solitude
a
full
of
prophetic
pain
there
was
her
lute
and
she
eschewed
it
seeing
that
her
fingers
seemed
as
ice
as
for
her
embroidery
the
stitches
wandered
haphazard
wrought
grotesque
things
or
lost
all
method
in
a
stupor
of
sloth
she
threw
the
banner
aside
in
a
fume
at
last
and
let
her
broodings
have
their
way
the
forenoon
crawled
like
a
beggar
on
a
dusty
in
the
welt
of
august
time
seemed
to
stand
and
mock
her
hour
by
hour
she
was
tortured
by
the
vision
of
steel
falling
upon
a
strong
young
neck
of
a
white
face
lying
in
a
pool
of
blood
of
a
dripping
carcase
and
a
sweating
sword
though
the
vision
maddened
her
what
could
her
weak
hands
do
the
man
was
shackled
and
guarded
by
men
with
whom
she
dared
not
tamper
moreover
she
remembered
the
last
look
in
fulviac
s
keen
eyes
towards
evening
she
grew
rabid
with
unrest
fled
from
the
cave
by
the
northern
stair
and
took
sanctuary
amid
the
tall
shadows
of
the
forest
the
pine
avenues
were
ever
like
a
church
to
her
solemn
stately
sympathetic
as
night
there
was
nought
to
anger
nought
to
bring
discord
where
the
croon
of
the
branches
soothed
like
a
song
it
was
as
she
played
the
nun
in
this
forest
cloister
that
a
strange
thought
challenged
her
consciousness
under
the
trees
it
was
subtle
yet
full
of
an
incomprehensible
bitterness
that
made
her
heart
hasten
even
as
she
considered
it
as
a
girl
gazes
at
a
jewel
lying
in
her
palm
the
charm
flashed
magic
fire
into
her
eyes
this
victim
for
the
sword
lay
shackled
to
the
wall
in
the
great
she
would
go
and
steal
a
last
glance
at
him
before
fulviac
and
death
returned
stairway
bower
and
gallery
were
behind
her
she
stood
in
fulviac
s
parlour
where
the
lamp
burnt
dimly
and
harness
glimmered
on
the
walls
the
door
of
the
room
stood
ajar
she
stole
to
it
and
peered
through
the
crack
left
by
the
clumsy
hingeing
into
the
lights
and
shadows
of
the
room
beyond
at
the
lower
end
of
a
long
table
the
two
guards
sat
dicing
sprawling
greedily
over
the
board
the
lust
of
hazard
writ
large
in
their
looks
the
dice
kept
up
a
continuous
patter
punctuated
by
the
intent
growls
of
the
gamesters
by
the
sloping
wall
of
the
cavern
palleted
on
a
pile
of
dirty
straw
lay
the
lord
flavian
of
gambrevault
with
his
hands
shackled
to
a
staple
in
the
rock
he
lay
stretched
on
his
side
with
his
back
turned
towards
the
light
so
that
his
face
was
invisible
to
the
girl
behind
the
door
she
watched
the
man
awhile
with
a
curious
and
earnestness
there
was
pathos
in
the
prostrate
figure
as
though
the
man
had
turned
to
the
bare
rock
and
the
callous
comfort
despair
could
give
once
she
imagined
that
she
saw
a
jerking
of
the
shoulders
that
hinted
at
something
very
womanish
the
thought
smote
new
pity
into
her
and
sent
her
away
from
the
cranny
trembling
yeoland
withdrew
into
fulviac
s
room
and
thence
into
the
murk
of
the
gallery
leading
to
her
bower
a
sudden
sense
of
impotence
had
flooded
into
her
heart
she
even
yearned
for
some
shock
of
fate
that
might
break
the
very
bonds
that
bound
her
to
her
vengeance
as
to
a
corpse
on
the
threshold
of
her
room
a
sudden
sound
brought
her
to
a
halt
like
a
hand
thrust
out
of
the
dark
to
clutch
her
throat
she
stood
listening
like
a
miser
for
thieves
and
heard
much
a
curse
came
from
the
the
crash
of
an
overturned
bench
the
tingling
kiss
of
steel
she
heard
the
scream
as
of
one
stabbed
a
smothered
uproar
an
indiscriminate
scuffling
then
silence
she
stood
a
moment
in
the
dark
listening
the
silence
was
heavy
and
implacable
as
the
rock
above
fear
seized
her
a
lust
to
know
the
worst
she
ran
down
the
gallery
into
fulviac
s
room
the
door
was
still
ajar
she
thrust
it
open
and
entered
the
great
cavern
her
doubts
elapsed
in
an
instant
at
the
long
table
a
man
sat
with
his
head
pillowed
on
his
arms
a
red
rivulet
curled
away
over
the
board
winding
amid
the
drinking
horns
isleting
the
dice
in
its
course
on
the
floor
lay
the
second
guard
a
smudge
of
crimson
oozing
from
his
grey
doublet
his
arms
rigid
his
hands
clawing
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
table
stood
the
lord
flavian
of
gambrevault
free
three
cubits
of
steel
had
tangled
the
plot
vastly
in
the
passing
of
a
minute
the
climax
was
like
a
knot
of
silk
thrust
through
with
a
sword
the
two
stood
motionless
a
moment
staring
at
each
other
across
the
length
of
the
table
like
a
couple
of
mutes
over
a
grave
the
man
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
madame
he
said
with
a
certain
grand
air
and
a
flippant
gesture
suffer
me
to
condone
with
you
over
the
lamentable
tricks
of
fortune
but
for
gross
selfishness
on
my
part
i
should
still
be
chastening
myself
for
the
unjust
balancing
of
our
feud
god
wills
it
seemingly
that
i
should
continue
to
be
your
debtor
despite
her
woman
s
wit
the
girl
was
wholly
puzzled
how
to
answer
him
she
was
wickedly
conscious
in
her
heart
of
a
subtle
gratitude
to
heaven
for
the
sudden
baulking
of
her
malice
the
man
expected
wrath
from
her
perhaps
an
outburst
of
passion
taking
duplicity
to
her
soul
she
stood
forward
on
the
dais
and
tilted
her
chin
at
him
with
dutiful
defiance
thank
my
irresolution
messire
she
said
for
this
reprieve
of
fortune
he
came
two
steps
nearer
as
though
not
unminded
to
talk
with
her
in
open
field
at
dawn
i
might
have
had
you
slain
she
continued
with
some
hastening
of
her
tongue
i
confess
to
having
pitied
you
a
little
you
are
young
a
mere
boy
weak
and
powerless
i
gave
you
life
for
a
day
the
man
reddened
slightly
glanced
at
the
dead
men
and
screwed
his
mouth
into
a
dry
smile
most
harmless
as
you
see
madame
he
said
for
your
magnanimity
i
thank
you
i
will
be
as
grateful
as
i
may
she
stood
considering
him
out
of
her
dark
eyes
the
man
was
good
to
look
upon
ruddy
and
clean
of
lip
with
eyes
that
stared
straight
to
the
truth
and
a
pose
of
the
head
that
prophesied
spirit
the
sunlight
of
youth
played
sanguine
upon
his
face
yet
there
was
also
a
certain
shadow
there
as
of
premature
wisdom
born
of
pain
there
were
faint
lines
about
the
mouth
and
eyes
for
all
its
sleek
and
ruddy
comeliness
it
was
not
the
face
of
a
boy
messire
she
said
to
him
at
last
madame
he
who
lurks
over
long
in
the
wolf
s
den
may
meet
the
dam
at
the
door
he
smiled
at
her
a
frank
flash
of
sympathy
that
was
not
devoid
of
gratitude
haste
would
be
graceless
he
said
to
her
how
so
she
asked
him
ha
madame
yeoland
have
i
not
watched
my
arms
at
night
before
the
high
altar
at
avalon
have
i
not
sworn
to
serve
women
to
keep
troth
and
to
love
god
you
judge
me
hardly
if
you
think
of
me
as
a
butcher
and
a
murderer
for
the
death
of
your
kinsfolk
i
hold
myself
ashamed
there
was
a
fine
light
upon
his
face
a
power
of
truth
in
his
voice
that
was
not
hypocritic
the
girl
stared
him
over
with
a
certain
critical
earnestness
that
boasted
a
gleam
of
approval
fair
words
she
said
to
him
you
did
not
speak
thus
to
me
last
eve
ah
he
cried
beaming
on
her
i
was
cold
as
a
corpse
nor
could
i
whine
for
pride
and
your
shackles
he
laughed
and
held
up
both
hands
the
wrists
were
chafed
and
bloody
it
was
ever
a
jest
against
me
he
said
that
i
had
the
hands
of
a
woman
white
and
meagre
yet
strong
with
the
sword
your
fellows
thrust
a
pair
of
wristlets
on
me
fit
for
a
goliath
strong
but
bulky
my
hands
have
proved
my
salvation
i
pulled
them
through
while
the
guards
diced
crept
for
a
sword
gained
it
and
my
freedom
she
nodded
and
was
not
markedly
dismal
though
the
wind
had
veered
against
her
cause
the
man
with
the
grey
eyes
was
a
being
one
could
not
quarrel
with
with
easy
sincerity
probably
it
did
not
strike
her
at
the
moment
that
this
friendly
argument
with
the
man
she
had
plotted
to
slay
was
a
contradiction
worthy
of
a
woman
the
lord
of
avalon
meanwhile
had
drawn
still
nearer
to
the
girl
upon
the
dais
his
grey
eyes
had
taken
a
warmer
lustre
into
their
depths
as
though
her
beauty
had
kindled
something
akin
to
awe
in
his
heart
he
set
the
point
of
the
sword
on
the
floor
his
hands
on
the
hilt
and
looked
up
at
the
white
face
medallioned
in
the
black
splendour
of
its
hair
madame
he
said
very
gravely
it
is
the
way
of
the
world
to
feel
remorse
when
such
an
emotion
is
expedient
and
to
fling
penitence
into
the
bottomless
pit
when
the
peril
is
past
i
shall
prove
to
you
that
mine
is
no
such
april
penitence
here
on
the
cross
of
my
sword
i
swear
to
you
a
great
oath
first
that
i
will
build
a
chapel
in
cambremont
glade
and
establish
a
priest
there
secondly
i
will
rebuild
the
tower
refit
it
royally
attach
to
it
cottars
and
borderers
from
mine
own
lands
lastly
mass
shall
be
said
and
tapers
burnt
for
your
kinsfolk
in
every
church
in
the
south
i
myself
will
do
such
penance
as
the
lord
bishop
shall
ordain
for
my
soul
the
man
was
hotly
in
earnest
over
the
vow
red
as
a
ruby
set
in
the
sun
yeoland
looked
down
upon
him
with
the
glimmer
of
a
smile
upon
her
lips
as
he
kissed
the
cross
of
the
sword
you
seem
honest
she
said
to
him
madame
on
this
sword
i
swear
it
it
is
hard
to
believe
any
good
of
an
enemy
behold
me
then
before
you
as
a
friend
there
is
a
feud
betwixt
us
not
of
my
willing
by
god
s
light
i
am
eager
to
bridge
the
gulf
and
to
be
at
peace
she
shook
her
head
and
looked
at
him
with
a
sudden
mysterious
sadness
such
a
pardon
was
beyond
belief
the
man
s
pure
ardour
nothing
but
seed
cast
upon
sand
fulviac
a
tower
of
steel
seemed
to
loom
beyond
him
an
iron
figure
of
fate
grim
and
terrible
this
can
never
be
she
said
his
eyes
were
honestly
sorrowful
is
madame
so
implacable
ah
she
said
you
do
not
understand
me
he
stood
a
moment
in
thought
as
though
casting
about
in
his
heart
for
the
reason
of
her
sternness
despite
her
wrongs
he
was
assured
by
some
spirit
voice
that
it
was
not
death
that
stalked
betwixt
them
like
an
angel
of
doom
as
he
stood
and
brooded
a
gleam
of
the
truth
flashed
in
upon
his
brain
he
went
some
steps
back
from
her
as
though
destiny
decreed
it
that
they
should
sever
unabsolved
your
pardon
madame
he
said
to
her
the
riddle
is
plain
to
me
i
no
longer
grope
into
the
dark
this
man
here
is
your
husband
she
went
red
as
a
rose
blushing
on
her
green
throne
at
the
coming
of
the
dawn
messire
your
pardon
ah
i
am
no
wife
she
said
to
him
god
knows
but
for
this
man
i
should
be
friendless
and
without
home
he
has
spread
honour
and
chivalry
before
my
feet
like
a
cloak
even
in
this
my
godless
vengeance
he
has
served
me
the
man
strode
suddenly
towards
the
dais
with
his
face
turned
up
to
hers
a
strange
light
played
upon
it
half
of
passion
half
of
pity
his
voice
shook
for
all
its
sanguine
strength
ah
madame
tell
me
one
thing
before
i
go
messire
have
i
your
pardon
if
you
love
life
messire
leave
me
have
i
your
pardon
go
ere
it
is
too
late
like
a
ghostly
retort
to
her
appeal
came
the
sound
of
armed
men
thundering
over
the
bridge
their
rough
voices
rose
in
the
night
s
silence
smitten
through
with
the
clash
and
clangour
of
arms
fulviac
had
caught
john
of
brissac
s
company
in
the
woods
by
gilderoy
there
had
been
a
bloody
tussle
and
much
slaughter
triumphant
they
were
at
the
gate
with
prosper
the
preacher
in
their
midst
the
pair
in
the
cavern
stared
at
each
other
with
a
mute
appeal
fulviac
said
the
girl
in
a
whisper
the
door
it
is
barred
they
were
silent
and
as
children
caught
in
the
midst
of
mischief
mailed
fists
and
pike
staves
were
beating
upon
the
gate
a
babel
of
impatience
welled
up
without
adrian
gregory
lazy
curs
unbar
unbar
mocking
silence
leered
in
retort
yeoland
and
the
lord
of
avalon
were
still
as
mice
the
din
slackened
and
waned
as
though
fulviac
s
men
were
listening
for
sound
of
life
within
then
came
more
blows
upon
the
gate
fingers
fumbled
at
the
closed
grill
the
man
gregory
lay
and
stared
at
the
rocky
roof
adrian
sat
with
his
face
pooled
by
his
own
blood
a
fiercer
voice
sounded
above
the
clamour
it
was
fulviac
s
the
girl
shivered
as
she
stood
ho
there
gregory
adrian
what
s
amiss
with
ye
still
silence
mocking
and
implacable
the
lull
held
for
the
moment
then
the
storm
gathered
break
down
the
gate
roared
the
voice
by
god
we
will
see
the
bottom
of
this
damned
silence
the
lord
flavian
of
avalon
had
stood
listening
with
the
look
of
a
man
cooped
in
a
cavern
who
hears
the
sea
surging
to
his
feet
he
glanced
at
the
dead
guards
and
went
white
to
save
his
soul
from
purgatory
it
behoved
him
to
act
and
to
act
quickly
a
single
lamp
still
burnt
in
the
oratory
of
hope
he
went
near
to
the
girl
on
the
dais
and
held
up
the
crossed
hilt
of
his
sword
by
the
holy
cross
mercy
she
cast
a
frightened
glance
into
his
eyes
and
continued
mute
a
moment
the
thunder
grew
against
the
gate
the
crash
of
steel
a
rending
din
that
went
echoing
into
all
the
pits
and
of
the
place
fulviac
s
men
had
dragged
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
pine
up
the
causeway
and
were
charging
the
gate
till
the
timber
groaned
the
man
with
his
sword
held
like
a
crucifix
stood
and
pleaded
with
his
eyes
mercy
he
said
you
know
this
warren
and
can
save
me
are
you
a
craven
craven
before
god
no
only
desperate
what
hope
have
i
unharnessed
one
sword
against
fifty
for
yet
another
moment
she
appeared
irresolute
dazed
by
the
vision
of
fulviac
s
powerful
wrath
he
was
a
stark
man
and
a
terrible
and
she
feared
him
the
timbers
of
the
gate
began
to
crack
and
gape
flavian
of
avalon
lifted
up
his
voice
to
her
with
a
passionate
outburst
of
despair
god
madame
i
can
not
die
i
am
young
look
at
me
life
is
at
its
dawn
by
your
woman
s
mercy
hide
me
give
me
not
back
to
death
his
bitter
agitation
smote
her
to
the
core
she
looked
into
his
eyes
they
were
hungry
as
love
and
very
piteous
there
could
be
no
sinning
against
those
eyes
great
fear
flooded
over
her
like
a
green
billow
bearing
her
to
the
inevitable
in
a
moment
she
was
as
hot
to
save
him
as
if
he
had
been
her
lover
come
she
said
quick
before
the
gate
gives
she
led
him
like
the
wind
through
fulviac
s
parlour
and
down
the
gallery
to
her
own
bower
it
was
dark
and
lampless
she
groped
to
the
postern
fumbled
at
the
latch
and
conquered
it
night
streamed
in
she
pushed
the
man
out
and
pointed
to
the
steps
the
forest
she
said
for
your
life
bear
by
the
stars
for
the
north
a
full
moon
had
reared
her
silver
buckler
in

romantic
indiscretion
had
driven
him
northwards

athwart

reputation

that

the
damnable
heresies

had
come
to
gilderoy
on
a
white
mule
with
two
servants
at
his
back
an
apt
tongue
to
serve
him
and
much
craft
as
a
painter
and
goldsmith
he
had
set
up
a
at
gilderoy
and
had
cozened
the
patronage
of
the
magnates
and
the
merchants
moreover
he
had
netted
the
favour
of
the
lord
flavian
of
avalon
and
was
blazoning
his
chapel
for
him

the
lavish
fancy

florentine

in

cataract
of

that
poured

window

wore
the
white
habit
of
dominic
and
the
long
black
mantle

golden
mist
played
about
his
figure
as
he
rubbed
his
palette
and
scanned
with
the
egotism
of
the
artist

painted
above
the
lord

state

that
gentleman
in

established
himself
on
a
velvet
hassock
before
the
altar
steps
thus
flattering
the
friar
in
the
part
of
a
sympathetic
patron
the
lord
of
avalon
had
dedicated
his
own
person
to
art
as
an
eastern
king
in
the
splendour
of
gothic
arms
kneeling
before
the
infant
christ
fra
balthasar
was
a
plump
man
and
a
comely
black
of
eye
and
full
of

his
shaven
chin
shone
blue
as
sleek
velvet
he
had
turned
from

towards
the
altar
where
a
triptych
gleamed
with
massed
and
brilliant
colour
the
virgin
a
palpitating
divinity
breathing
stars
and
gems
from
her
full
bosom
gazed
with
a
face
of
sensuous
serenity
at
the
infant
lying
in
her
lap
she
seemed
to
exhale
an
atmosphere
of
gold
on
either
wing
angels
transcendant
girls
in
green

silver
purple

azure
scarlet
and
white
made
the
soul
swim
with
visions
of
ruddy

their
wings
gleamed
like
opals
they
looked
too
frail
for
angels
too
human
for
heaven
the
lord
of
avalon
sat
on
his
scarlet
hassock
and
stared
at
the
madonna
with
some
measure
of
awe
she
was
no
attenuated
angular
fragment
of
saintliness
but
by
every
curve
a
woman
from
plump
finger
to
coral
lip
you
are
no
byzantine
quoth
the
man
on
the
hassock
with
something
of
a
sigh
the
priest
glanced
at
him
and
smiled
there
were
curves
in
lip
and
nostril
that
were
more
than
indicative
of
a
sleek
and
sensuous
worldliness
fra

much
of
an
antinous

i
confess
sire
that
i
am
a
man
the
friar
s
opulent
extravagance
of
sentiment
suited
the
litheness
of
his
look
balthasar
had
enthroned
himself
in
his
own
imagination
as
a
species
of
apollo
a
seer
whose
soul
soared
into
the
glittering
infinitudes
of
art
an
immense
egotist
he
posed
as
a
divinity
palpitating
to
colour
and
to
sound
he
had
as
many
moods
as
a
vain
woman
and
was
a
mere

the

on

with
some
tightening
of
the
upper
lip

too
big
for

methinks
balthasar
touched
a
panel
with
his

cast
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
with
a
cynical
lifting
of
the
nostril
my
frock

me

as
well
as

and

the
things

the
man
swept
a
vermilion
streak
from
his
brush
an
ingenuous
question
messire
i
am
ever
ingenuous
a
perilous
habit
yet
you
have
not
answered
me
the
friar
tilted
his
chin
like
a
woman
eyeing
herself
in
a
mirror
religion
is
full
of
picturesque
incidents
he
said
and
is
profitable

are
ever
many
rich

devout
fools
in

give
me
a
gleaming

rising
ruddy
from

what

trim

up

put
a

infant
in

the
man
on

smiled
despite
the

a
smile
that
had
more
scorn
in
it
than

said
there
can
be

where
there
is
no

i

i

let
it
beat
its
wings
into

hence
with

the
man
on

grimaced
and
eyed
the

as

quoth
the
man
by
the
altar
balthasar
s
hand
worked
viciously
he
was
strenuous
towards
his
own
beliefs
after
the
fashion
of
dreamers
delirious
with
egotism
the
very
splendour
of
his
infidelity
took
its
birth
from
the
fact
that
it
was
largely
of
his
own
creating
his
pert
iconoclasm
pandered
to
his
own
vast
tell
me
for
what
you

said
the

for
beauty
and
the
senses

to
breathe
to
burn
and
to
enjoy
to
be
a
greek
and
a
god
and
life
is
a
great
fresco
a
pageant
of
passions
the
lord
of
avalon
sprang
up
and
began
to
pace
the
aisle
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
blood
is
fevered
for
all
his
devoutness
and
his
mystical
fidelity
he
was
in
too
human
and
passionate
a
mood
to
be
invulnerable
to
balthasar
s
sensuous
shafts
of
fire
the
lord
flavian
had
come
by
a
transcendental
spirit
an
inspiration
that
had
torched
the
wild
beacon
of
romance
he
was
red
for
a
riot
of
chivalry
a
passage
of
desire
turning
back
towards
the
altar
he
faced
the
madonna
with
her
choir
of
angel
girls
fra
balthasar
was
watching
him
with
a
feline
sleekness
of
visage
and
a
smile
that
boasted
something
of
contempt
the
friar
considered
spirituality
a
species
of
magician
s
lanthorn
for
the
cozening
of
fools
what
quip
have
you
for
love
said
the
younger
man
halting
by
the
altar
rails
balthasar
stood
with
poised
brush
there
is
some
sincerity
in
the
emotion
he
said
you
are
experienced
sire
consider
my
the
friar
s
mock
horror
was
surprising
an
excellent
jest
that
fell
like
a
blunted
bolt
from
the
steel
of
a
vigorous
manhood
the
lord
flavian
ran

asked

may
be
a

without

of

how
much
of

do
you
understand
fra
balthasar
cleared
his
throat
the
lady

is
a
rose
of

monk
my
lord
it
was
your
dictum
that
you
are
ever
ingenuous
i
echo
you
need
i
confess
to
you
on
such
a
subject
nay

you
have
the
inconsistency
of
a
poet
how
so
well
well

can
sniff
rotten
apples
without
opening
the
door

cupboard
the
younger
man
jerked
away
and
went
striding
betwixt
the
array
of
frescoes
with
something
of
the
wild
vigour
of
a
blind
polyphemus
balthasar
subtle
sophist
watched
him
from
the
angle
of
his
eye
with
the
sardonic
superiority
of
one
well
versed
in
the
contradictions
of
the
world
he
had
scribbled
a
shrewd
sketch
of
the
passions
stirring
in
his
patron
s
heart
had
he
not
heard
from
the
man
s
own
lips
of
the
elf
of
the
pine
woods
and
her
vengeance
and
the
lady
duessa
fra
balthasar
was
as
wise
in
the
gossip
of
gilderoy
as
any
woman

he
said
as
the

turned
in
his
stride
i
ask
of

to
paint
your

said
balthasar
began
splashing
in
a
foreground
with
irritable
bravado
my
lord
you
were
a
fool
at
twenty
were
his
words
a
thrice
damned
fool
came
the
echo
balthasar
chuckled
and
now
messire
a
golden
chain
makes
a
tantalus
of
you
life
crawls
like
a
sluggish
river
you
chafe
you
strain
you
rebel

on
your

slips
from

by

ah

it
is
the
old
tale

have
cramped
up
your

and

shut
you
up
in
a
moral
sarcophagus
with
a
woman
they
call
your

you
burn
for
liberty
and
the
unknown
that
shines
like
a

streak
in
a
fading
west
ah
sire
you
look
for
that
one
marvellous
being
who
shall
torch
again
the
youth
in
your
heart
make
your
blood
burn
your
soul
to
sing
that
one
woman
in
the
world
mysterious
as
the
moon
subtle
as
the
night
ineffably
strange
as
a
flaming
dawn
that
woman
who
shall
lift
you
to
the
stars
whose
lips
suck
the
sap
of
the
world
whose
bosom
breathes
to
the
eternal
swoon
of

she
shall
light
the
lust
of
battle
in

out

took

loved

pretended
some
affection
for

perhaps
arrogance
of

seeing
that

duessa
was
very
determined
to
keep
him
in

suspected
that

as

termagant
that

such
freedom
could
be
won
solely
by
discipline
and
soldierly
concord
the
rogues
grumbled
and
swore
behind
his
back
but
were
glad
in
their
hearts
to
have
a
man
for
master
to
speak
again
of
the
girl
yeoland
that
march
night
she
had
met
fulviac
over
the
wreckage
of
the
broken
gate
and
had
made
a
profession
of
the
truth
so
far
she
said
as
she
could
conjecture
it
she
had
been
long
in
the
forest
had
returned
to
the
cliff
to
find
the
guards
slain
and
the
lord
flavian
gone
by
some
device
he
had
escaped
from
his
shackles
slain
the
men
and
fled
by
the
northern
postern
the
woman
made
a
goodly
pretence
of
vexation
of
spirit
over
the
escape
of
this
reprobate
she
even
taunted
fulviac
with
foolhardiness
and
lack
of
foresight
in
so
bungling
her
vengeance
the
man
s
escape
from
the
cliff
roused
fulviac
s
energies
to
full
flood
the
aristocrat
of
avalon
was
ignorant
of
the
volcano
bubbling
under
his
feet
yet
any
retaliatory
meddling
on
his
part
might
prove
disastrous
at
so
critical
an
hour
fulviac
thrust
forward
the
wheels
of
war
with
a
heavy
hand
the
torrents
of
sedition
and
discontent
were
converging
to
a
river
of
revolt
that
threatened
to
crush
tyranny
as
an
avalanche
crushes
a
forest
the
virgin
with
her
face
still
inspired
yeoland
with
the
visionary
behest
given
in
the
ruined
chapel
the
girl
s
fingers
toiled
at
the
scarlet
banner
she
spent
half
her
days
upon
her
knees
devout
as
any
helena
she
knew
fulviac
s
schemes
as
surely
as
she
did
the
beads
on
her
rosary
the
rough
rangers
of
the
forest
held
her
to
be
a
saint
and
knelt
to
touch
her
dress
as
she
passed
by
yet
what
are
dreams
but
snowflakes
drifting
from
the
heavens
now
white
now
red
as
god
or
man
carries
the
lamp
of
love
the
girl
s
ecstasy
of
faith
was
but
a
potion
to
her
dazing
her
from
a
yet
more
subtle
dream
a
faint
voice
summoned
her
from
the
unknown
she
would
hear
it
often
in
the
silence
of
the
night
or
at
full
noon
as
she
faltered
in
her
prayers
the
rosary
would
hang
idle
on
her
wrist
the
crucifix
melt
from
her
vision
she
would
find
her
heart
glowing
like
a
rose
at
the
touch
of
the
sun
anon
frightened
she
would
shake
the
human
half
of
herself
and
run
back
penitent
to
her
prayers
it
was
springtide
and
the
year
s
youth
when
memories
are
garlanded
with
green
and
romance
scatters
over
the
world
many
voices
awoke
like
the
chanting
of
birds
in
yeoland
s
heart
she
desired
even
as
a
swallow
to
see
the
old
haunts
again
to
go
a
pilgrim
to
the
place
where
the
dear
dead
slept
was
it
yearning
grief
or
a
joy
more
subtle
the
cry
of
the
wild
and
the
voice
of
desire
mayhap
white
flowers
shone
on
the
tree
of
life
prophetic
of
fruit
in
the
mellow
year
jaspar
the
harper
heard
her
plea
twas
wilful
and
eager
but
what
of
that
fulviac
good
man
had
ridden
to
gilderoy
the
girl
had
liberty
enough
and
to
spare
she
took
it
and
jaspar
and
rode
out
from
the
cliff
threading
the
sables
of
the
woods
they
came
one
noon
to
the
open
moor
it
was
golden
with
the
western
sun
solitary
as
the
sea
the
shadows
were
long
upon
the
sward
when
cambremont
wood
billowed
out
in
its
valley
there
was
no
hope
of
their
reaching
the
tower
before
dusk
so
they
piled
dead
bracken
under
a
cedar
where
the
shelving
eaves
swept
to
the
ground
they
were
astir
early
upon
the
morrow
a
wind
inspiring
the
woodlands
and
sculpturing
grand
friezes
from
the
marbles
of
the
sky
the
forest
was
full
of
the
glory
of
spring
starred
with
anemones
and
dusted
with
the
azure
campaniles
of
the
hyacinth
horde
primroses
lurked
on
the
lush
green
slopes
in
the
glades
the
forest
peristyles
green
gorse
blazed
with
its
constellations
of
gold
to
the
dolt
and
the
hag
the
world
is
nothing
but
a
fat
larder
only
the
unregenerate
are
blind
of
soul
beauty
shows
not
her
naked
loveliness
to
all
the
girl
yeoland
s
eyes
were
full
of
a
strange
lustre
that
may
morning
many
familiar
landmarks
did
she
pass
upon
the
way
notched
deep
on
the
cross
of
memory
there
stood
the
great
beech
tree
where
bertrand
had
carved
his
name
and
the
smooth
bark
still
bore
the
scars
where
the
knife
had
wantoned
she
forded
the
stream
where
roland
s
pony
had
once
pitched
him
into
the
mire
her
eyes
grew
dim
as
she
rode
through
the
woods
the
day
had
drawn
towards
noon
when
they
neared
the
glade
in
the
midst
of
cambremont
wood
heavy
wain
wheels
had
scarred
the
smooth
green
of
the
ride
and
the
pedestals
of
fallen
oaks
showed
where
woodmen
had
been
felling
timber
to
jaspar
the
harper
these
signs
were
more
eloquent
of
peril
than
of
peace
he
began
to
snuff
the
air
like
an
old
hound
and
to
jerk
restless
glances
at
the
girl
at
his
side
see
where
wheels
have
been
he
began
and
axes
my
friend
what
means
it
some
one
rebuilds
the
tower
the
harper
wagged
his
head
and
half
turned
his
horse
from
the
grass
ride
have
a
care
he
said
hide
in
the
woods
if
you
will
she
rode
on
with
a
triumphant
wilfulness
and
he
followed
her
as
they
neared
the
glade
the
noise
of
axe
and
hammer
floated
on
the
wind
and
they
saw
the
scene
flicker
towards
them
betwixt
the
great
boles
of
the
trees
the
tower
stood
with
battlements
of
fresh
white
stone
its
windows
had
been
reset
the
blasting
touch
of
fire
effaced
from
the
walls
the
glade
was
strewn
with
blocks
of
stone
and
lengths
of
timber
the
walls
of
a
chapel
were
rising
from
the
grass
men
were
digging
trenches
for
the
foundations
of
the
priest
s
cell
soldiers
idled
about
gossiping
with
the
masons
there
was
a
smile
in
the
girl
s
eyes
and
a
deeper
tint
upon
her
cheeks
as
she
stared
betwixt
the
trees
at
the
regarnished
tower
those
grey
eyes
had
promised
the
truth
in
fulviac
s
cavern
she
was
glad
in
her
heart
of
the
man
s
honour
glad
with
a
magic
that
made
her
colour
as
for
the
harper
he
stroked
his
grey
beard
and
was
mute
he
lacked
imagination
and
was
no
longer
young
on
a
stump
of
an
oak
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
sat
a
man
in
a
black
mantle
and
a
habit
of
white
cloth
he
had
a
panel
upon
his
knee
and
a
small
wooden
chest
beside
him
on
the
grass
his
eyes
were
turned
often
to
the
rolling
woods
as
his
plump
hand
flourished
a
brush
with
nervous
and
graceful
gestures
seeing
the
man
s
tonsure
and
his
dress
that
marked
him
a
dominican
yeoland
rode
out
from
the
trees
casting
her
horse
s
shadow
athwart
his
work
the
man
looked
up
with
puckered
brow
his
keen
eye
framing
the
girl
s
figure
at
a
glance
it
was
his
destiny
to
see
the
romantic
and
the
beautiful
in
all
things
the
priest
and
the
girl
on
the
horse
eyed
each
other
a
moment
in
silence
each
was
instinctively
examining
the
other
the
churchman
with
an
approving
glint
of
the
eye
was
the
first
to
break
the
woodland
silence
peace
be
with
you
madame
his
tone
hinted
at
a
question
and
the
girl
adopted
therewith
an
ingenuous
duplicity
my
man
and
i
were
of
a
hunting
party
she
said
we
went
astray
in
the
wood
you
father
will
guide
us
madame
has
not
discovered
to
me
her
desire
we
wish
for
gilderoy
balthasar
rose
and
pointed
with
his
brush
towards
the
ride
by
which
they
had
come
he
mapped
the
road
for
them
with
sundry
jaunty
flourishes
and
much
showing
of
his
white
teeth
yeoland
thanked
him
but
was
still
curious
ah
father
whither
have
we
wandered
men
call
it
cambremont
wood
madame
and
these
buildings
a
retreat
doubtless
for
holy
men
balthasar
corrected
her
with
much
unction
the
lord
flavian
of
avalon
builds
here
he
said
but
not
for
monks
i
madame
am
his
architect
his
pedagogue
in
painting
yeoland
pretended
interest
she
craned
forward
over
her
horse
s
neck
and
looked
at
the
priest
s
panel
the
act
decided
him
since
she
was
young
and
comely
balthasar
seized
the
chance
of
a
chivalrous
service
the
girl
had
fine
eyes
and
a
neck
worthy
of
a
venus
madame
has
taste
she
would
see
our
work
madame
appeared
very
ready
to
grant
the
favour
balthasar
put
his
brushes
aside
held
the
girl
s
stirrup
and
unconscious
of
the
irony
of
the
act
expatiated
to
yeoland
on
the
beauties
of
her
own
home
at
the
end
of
their
pilgrimage
being
not
a
little
bewitched
by
such
eyes
and
such
a
face
he
begged
of
her
the
liberty
of
painting
her
there
and
then
twas
for
the
enriching
of
religious
art
as
he
very
properly
put
it
dead
rual
s
grave
was
not
ten
paces
distant
and
jaspar
was
standing
by
it
as
in
prayer
thus
yeoland
sat
to
fra
balthasar
oblivious
of
him
indeed
as
his
fingers
brought
her
fair
face
into
being
her
shapely
throat
and
raven
hair
his
picture
perfected
he
blessed
her
with
the
unction
of
a
bishop
and
stood
watching
her
as
she
vanished
down
the
southern
ride
graceful
and
immaculate
as
a
young
dian
xv
hardly
had
an
hour
passed
and
fra
balthasar
was
still
touching
the
study
he
had
made
of
yeoland
s
face
when
a
company
of
spears
flashed
out
by
the
northern
ride
into
the
clearing
at
their
head
rode
a
knight
in
harness
of
burnished
steel
a
splendid
figure
flashing
chivalry
in
the
eyes
of
the
sun
on
his
shield
he
bore
a
castle
argent
with
ports
voided
of
the
field
on
a
field

the
arms
of
the
house
of
gambrevault
his
surcoat
was
diapered
azure
and
green
with
three
gold
suns
blazoned
thereon
his
baldric
a
splendid
streak
of
scarlet
silk
slashed
his
surcoat
as
with
blood
his
troop
men
in
half
armour
rode
under
the
pavon
vert
of
the
demesne
of
avalon
they
thundered
into
the
open
stretch
of
grass
with
a
clangorous
rattle
of
steel
flavian
for
his
salade
hung
at
his
and
he
wore
no
camail
scanned
the
glade
with
a
keen
stare
seeing
fra
balthasar
seated
under
a
tree
he
turned
his
horse
towards
him
and
smiled
as
the
churchman
put
his
tools
aside
and
gave
him
a
benediction
the
man
made
a
fine
figure
judged
by
the
flesh

might
have
stood
for
an
ambrose

passed
the

stared
at
it
flushed
to
the
temples

out
an
ejaculation
in

devoured
the

with
the
insatiable
enthusiasm
of

hot
off

an
hour

was
sitting

where

and
you
sketched

at
her

he
lifted
the
little
picture
at
arm
s
length
to
the
sun
kissed
it
and
put
it
in
his
bosom
his
face
was
radiant
he
laughed
as
though
some
golden
joy
rang
and
resounded
in
his
heart
a
hundred
golden
angels
for
this
face
fra
balthasar
was
in
great
measure
mystified
the
lord
of

swept
away
with

thundering
knights
into

woods

friar
settled
to
his
work
again
but
it
was
fated
that
he
was
to
have
no
lasting
peace
that
morning
he
was
painting
in
a
background
a
landscape
to
a
small
crucifixion
his
hand
was
out
of
touch
however
the
subject
was
not
congenial
a
pale
face
and
a
pair
of
dusky
eyes
had
deepened
a
different
stream
of
thought
in

hypersensuous
held
his
allegiance
from
prim
catholic
ethics
he
reverted
to
his
glorious
paganism
with
an
sense
of
satisfaction

was
interrupted
once
more
and
not
unpleasantly
by
a
lady
with
two
armed
servants
at
her
back
riding
in
from
the
forest
by
the
northern
ride
the
woman
was
clad
in
a
cloak
of
damask
red
and
a
jupon
of
dark
green
broidered
with
azure
scroll
work
her
hood
fallen
back
showed
her
purple
black
hair
bound
up
in
a
net
of

large
dark
eyes
flashed
and
smouldered
under
their
long
lashes

had
high
a
big
nose

full
as

rose

was
big
of
body
voluptuous
to
look
upon
as
an
eastern
odalisque
a
woman
of
great
passions
great
appetites
fra
balthasar
tumbled
his
brushes
and
paints
aside
and
went
to
meet
her
as
she
rode
over
the
grass
there
was
a
smile
on
the
man
s
lips
a
flush
upon
his
sleek
face
as
he
walked
with
a
courtly
and
debonair
vanity
the
woman
caught
sight
of
him
and
wheeled
her
horse
in
his
direction
the
autumn
splendour
of
her
cheeks
told
of
hard
riding
and
her

dropped
foam
from

black
muzzle

crossed
himself
with
much
meekness

greeting

his
words
as

kept
his

on

ground

scanned
the

with
the
strenuous
spirit
of

boadicea

glanced
at

well
that
are
too
bright
pardon
me
i
would
serve
you
she
took
a
deep
breath
held
out
her
hand
to
him
a
big
warm
hand
soft
and
white
the
man
s
lips
burnt
upon
it
she
touched
his
cheek
and
saw
him
colour
well
my
lord
flavian
is
not
here
but
has
been
where
now
away
hunting
ha
what
madame
what
do
men
hunt
and
burn
for
sometimes
a
stag
a
hare
a
standard
a
woman
sometimes
a
woman
balthasar
looking
slantwise
under
lids
saw
her
eyes
flash
and
her
lips
tighten
which
way
the
southern
ride
towards
gilderoy
duessa
shook
her
bridle
and
threw
one
look
into
balthasar
s
eyes
remember
she
said
remember
a
woman
loves
a
friend
a
true
friend
who
can
tell
a
lie
or
keep
a
secret
balthasar
watched
her
ride
away
he
stood
and
smiled
to
himself
while
his
long
fingers
played
with
the
folds
of
his
mantle
red
wine
was
bounding
in
his
blood
and
his
imagination
revelled
he
was
a
poetic
person
and
a
poet
s
soul
is
often
like
tinder
safe
enough
till
the
spark
falls
he
said
to
himself
with
a
smirk
here
s
hunting
with
a
vengeance
two
women
and
a
man
the
devil
is
loose
soul
of
masaccio
that
woman
has
fine
eyes
that
day
when
the
sky
was
growing
red
over
the
woods
flavian
and
his
troop
drew
close
on
the
heels
of
yeoland
and
the
harper
the
man
for
all
his
heat
had
kept
his
well
in
hand
once
out
of
cambremont
wood
they
had
met
a
who
had
seen
yeoland
and
her
follower
pass
towards
the
west
they
had
hunted
fast
over
fell
and
moor
while
not
two
miles
behind
came
duessa
of
the
black
hair
biting
her
lips
and
giving
her
brute
lash
and
spur
with
a
woman
s
viciousness
yeoland
halting
on
a
slope
above
the
pine
woods
looked
back
and
saw
something
that
made
her
crane
her
neck
and
wax
vigilant
out
of
the
east
and
the
twilight
gloom
came
the
lightning
of
harness
the
galloping
gleam
of
armed
men
jaspar
s
blear
eyes
were
unequal
to
the
girl
s
the
men
below
were
riding
hard
half
under
the
lea
of
the
midnight
pines
whose
tops
touched
the
sunset
a
of
steel
their
crescent
closed
wood
and
moor
they
had
the
lead
in
the
west
they
were
mounting
the
slope
behind
jaspar
saw
them
at
last
he
was
for
galloping
yeoland
held
him
in
fool
we
are
caught
sit
still
we
shall
gain
nothing
by
bolting
a
knight
was
coming
up
the
slope
at
a
canter
yeoland
saw
his
shield
read
it
and
his
name
she
went
red
under
her
hood
felt
her
heart
beating
wondered
at
its
noise
youth
aglitter
in
arms
splendid
triumphant
a
face
bare
to
the
west
eyes
radiant
and
tender
a
great
horse
reined
in
on
its
haunches
a
mailed
hand
that
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
madame
your
pardon
he
drew
balthasar
s
picture
from
his
bosom
and
held
it
before
her
eyes
my
torch
he
said
that
led
me
to
see
your
face
again
the
girl
was
silent
her
head
was
thrown
back
her
slim
throat
showing
her
face
turned
heavenwards
like
the
face
of
a
woman
who
is
kissed
upon
the
lips
you
have
seen
your
home
yes
messire
god
pardon
me
your
sorrow
you
see
i
am
no
hypocrite
i
keep
my
vows
yes
messire
madame
let
me
be
forgiven
you
have
trusted
one
man
trust
another
she
turned
her
horse
suddenly
and
began
to
ride
towards
the
black
maw
of
the
forest
her
lips
were
tightly
closed
and
she
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
flavian
a
tower
of
steel
was
at
her
side
armed
men
ranged
in
a
circle
about
them
they
opened
ranks
at
a
sign
from
their
lord
and
gave
the
woman
passage
madame
messire
am
i
to
be
forgiven
she
was
mute
a
moment
as
in
thought
then
she
spoke
quietly
enough
yes
for
a
vow
tell
it
me
if
you
will
never
see
my
face
again
he
looked
at
her
with
a
great
smile
drew
his
sword
and
held
the
point
towards
her
then
give
me
hate
messire
hate
not
forgiveness
hate
utter
and
divine
that
i
may
fight
and
travail
labour
and
despair
messire
hate
me
hate
me
with
all
the
unreason
of
your
heart
hate
me
a
hundred
times
that
i
may
but
leap
a
hundred
times
into
your
life
bar
me
out
that
i
may
storm
your
battlements
again
and
again
are
you
a
fool
a
glorious
mad
inspired
fool
they
were
quite
near
the
trees
their
black
masses
threw
a
great
shadow
over
the
pair
higher
still
the
sky
burnt
madame
whither
do
you
go
where
you
may
not
venture
messire
god
i
know
no
such
region
she
flashed
round
on
him
with
sudden
bitterness
go
back
to
your
wife
go
back
to
your
wife
messire
remember
her
honour
it
was
a
but
it
did
not
shame
or
weaken
him
he
sheathed
his
sword
and
looked
at
her
sadly
out
of
his
grey
eyes
what
a
world
is
this
he
said
when
heaven
comes
at
last
hell
yawns
across
the
path
when
summer
burns
winter
lifts
its
head
even
as
a
man
would
grow
strong
and
pure
his
own
cursed
shackles
cumber
him
i
say
no
more
to
you
go
madame
pray
for
me
you
shall
see
my
face
again
he
let
life
vanish
under
the
pines
and
rode
back
with
the
sunset
on
his
armour
his
face
staring
into
the
rising
night
his
men
came
round
him
silent
statues
of
steel
he
rode
slowly
and
met
his
wife
her
eyes
were
turbulent
her
lips
red
streaks
of
scorn
ha
sire
i
have
found
you
madame
i
trust
you
are
well
they
looked
at
each
other
askance
like
angry
dogs
as
they
rode
side
by
side
and
the
night
came
down
the
men
left
them
to
themselves
and
went
on
ahead
a
wind
grew
gusty
over
the
moor
illustration
they
looked
at
each
other
askance
like
angry
dogs
messire
i
have
borne
enough
from
you
madame
is
it
fault
of
mine
his
whole
soul
revolted
from
her
with
an
immensity
of
hate
she
cumbered
clogged
crushed
him
mad
brutality
leapt
in
his
heart
towards
her
he
could
have
smitten
the
woman
through
with
his
sword
five
years
ago
she
said
you
did
the
wooing
damnation
we
have
been
marvellously
happy
she
bit
her
lip
and
was
white
as
the
moon
have
a
care
messire
have
a
care
threats
threats
have
a
care
look
at
my
shield
have
i
quartered
your
arms
with
mine
god
s
blood
there
is
nothing
to
erase
ha
we
have
no
children
go
on
i
shall
send
gold
and
an
embassage
to
the
pope
she
clenched
her
hands
and
could
not
speak
for
the
moment
you
dare
do
this
i
dare
ten
thousand
greater
things
than
this
by
god
messire
by
god
woman
am
i
going
down
to
hell
because
you
are
my
wife
she
grew
quiet
very
suddenly
a
dangerous
move
in
a
woman
very
well
she
said
try
it
dear
lord
i
am
no
fool
try
it
i
am
as
strong
as
you
and
so
they
rode
on
towards
avalon
together
xvi
it
is
impossible
for
two
persons
of
marked
individuality
to
be
much
together
without
becoming
more
or
less
faceted
one
towards
the
other
we
appeal
by
sympathy
and
inspire
by
contrast
what
greater
glory
falls
to
a
man
s
lot
than
to
be
chastened
by
the
warm
may
of
some
girl
s
pure
heart
yeoland
had
felt
the
force
of
fulviac
s
manhood
the
more
eternal
and
holier
instincts
were
being
stirred
in
him
by
a
woman
s
face
the
man
s
life
had
been
a
transmigration
in
his
younger
days
the
world
had
banqueted
him
new
poignancies
had
bubbled
against
his
lips
in
the
cup
of
pleasure
later
had
come
that
inevitable
weariness
that
distaste
of
pomp
the
mood
that
discovers
vanity
in
all
things
finally
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
a
woman
a
broken
reed
indeed
and
had
discovered
her
a
hypocrite
according
to
the
measure
of
her
passions
there
had
been
one
brief
burst
of
blasphemy
he
had
used
his
dagger
and
had
disappeared
there
had
been
much
stir
at
the
time
a
ruby
had
fallen
from
the
king
s
crown
some
spoke
of
palestine
others
of
a
monastery
others
of
a
cubit
of
keen
steel
fulviac
had
begun
life
over
again
he
had
fallen
back
upon
elemental
interests
had
gone
hungry
fought
for
his
supper
slept
many
a
storm
out
under
a
tree
the
breath
of
the
wilderness
had
winnowed
out
luxury
rain
had
scourged
him
into
philosophic
hardihood
he
had
learnt
in
measure
that
nothing
pleases
and
endures
like
simplicity
even
his
ambition
was
simple
in
its
audacious
grandeur
now
the
eyes
of
the
daughter
of
rual
were
like
the
eyes
of
a
madonna
and
she
stood
in
a
circle
of
white
lilies
like
the
spirit
of
purity
fulviac
had
begun
to
believe
in
her
a
little
to
love
her
a
little
she
stood
above
all
other
women
he
had
known
the
ladies
of
the
court
were
superb
and
comely
and
marvellously
kind
but
they
loved
colour
and
contemned
the
robe
of
white
they
were
like
a
rich
posy
for
a
man
to
choose
from
scarlet
and
gold
azure
damask
or
purple
you
could
love
their
bodies
but
you
could
not
trust
their
souls
as
for
the
girl
yeoland
she
was
very
devout
very
enthusiastic
but
no
agnes
her
rosary
had
little
rest
and
with
the
suspicions
of
one
not
utterly
sure
of
herself
she
had
striven
to
make
religion
and
its
results
satisfy
her
soul
in
some
measure
she
had
succeeded
yet
there
is
ever
that
psychic
echo
that
one
mysterious
being
subtle
as
the
stars
that
may
come
before
christ
in
the
heart
transcendent
spirit
of
idolatry
and
yet
it
is
often
seeing
that
it
leads
many
a
soul
to
god
it
had
become
yeoland
s
custom
to
walk
daily
in
the
pine
wood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
leading
from
the
northern
room
she
had
discovered
a
quaint
nook
a
mile
or
more
from
the
cliff
a
nook
where
trees
stood
gathered
in
a
dense
circle
about
a
grassy
mound
capped
by
a
square
of
mouldering
stone
it
was
a
grave
nameless
and
without
legend
perhaps
a
hermit
had
crumbled
away
there
under
the
sods
or
the
bones
of
some
old
warrior
slept
within
rusty
harness
none
knew
none
cared
greatly
fulviac
s
men
had
hinted
at
treasure
yet
even
they
were
kept
from
desecrating
the
place
by
a
crude
and
superstitious
veneration
for
the
dead
she
had
wandered
here
one
day
and
had
settled
herself
on
the
grassy
slope
of
the
grave
the
ribbon
of
her
lute
lay
over
her
shoulder
a
breeze
sang
fitfully
through
the
branches
and
a
golden
haze
shimmered
down
as
from
the
clerestory
windows
of
a
cathedral
her
lute
seemed
sad
when
it
made
answer
to
her
fingers
thought
was
plaintive
and
not
devotional
if
one
might
judge
by
the
mood
of
the
music
and
the
notes
were
wayward
and
pathetically
void
of
discipline
it
was
while
the
girl
thrummed
idly
at
the
strings
that
a
vague
sound
floated
down
to
her
with
the
momentary
emphasis
born
of
a
fickle
wind
it
was
foreign
to
the
forest
or
it
would
not
have
roused
her
as
it
did
as
she
listened
the
sound
came
again
from
the
west
it
was
neither
the
distant
bay
of
a
hound
nor
a
horn
s
solitary
note
there
was
something
metallic
about
it
something
musical
when
it
disappeared
she
listened
for
its
recurrence
when
she
heard
it
again
she
puzzled
over
its
nature
the
sound
grew
clearer
at
gradual
intervals
and
then
ceased
utterly
the
girl
listened
for
a
long
while
to
no
purpose
and
then
prepared
to
forget
the
incident
the
decision
was
premature
she
was
startled
anon
by
the
sound
breaking
out
at
no
great
distance
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
its
nature
it
was
the
clanging
of
a
bell
yeoland
wondered
who
could
be
carrying
such
a
thing
in
such
a
place
possibly
some
of
fulviac
s
men
were
coming
home
with
stolen
cattle
and
an
old
from
some
wild
moorland
with
them
the
sound
of
the
bell
came
very
near
it
seemed
close
amid
the
circling
ranks
of
pines
twigs
were
cracking
too
and
she
heard
the
beat
of
approaching
footsteps
then
her
glance
caught
something
visible
a
streak
of
white
in
the
shadows
moving
like
a
ghost
the
thing
went
amid
the
trees
with
the
bell
mute
the
girl
s
doubts
were
soon
set
at
rest
as
to
whether
she
had
been
seen
or
no
the
figure
in
grey
slipped
between
the
pines
and
came
out
into
the
grass
circle
about
the
grave
cowled
masked
bell
at
girdle
a
leper
the
girl
stared
at
it
with
a
cold
flutter
at
her
heart
the
thing
stood
under
the
boughs
motionless
as
stone
the
bell
gave
never
a
tinkle
a
white
chin
poked
forward
from
under
the
hood
the
masked
face
was
in
shadow
then
the
bell
jangled
and
a
gruff
voice
came
from
the
cowl
unclean
unclean
it
said
avoid
the
white
death
and
give
alms
yeoland
obeyed
readily
enough
put
a
portion
of
the
grave
betwixt
herself
and
the
leper
fumbled
in
her
pouch
and
threw
the
man
a
piece
of
silver
he
came
forward
suddenly
into
the
light
fell
on
his
knees
put
his
hood
back
plucked
off
the
mask
it
was
the
face
of
the
lord
flavian
of
gambrevault
the
girl
stood
and
stared
at
him
with
unstinted
astonishment
you
she
said
you
madame
i
said
that
you
should
see
my
face
again
she
conceived
a
sudden
impetuous
desire
to
turn
and
leave
him
on
his
knees
but
some
inner
potency
of
instinct
restrained
her
she
looked
down
at
the
man
with
no
kindling
kindness
upon
her
face
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
how
to
tune
her
mood
the
first
thought
that
rushed
into
her
mind
was
seized
upon
and
pressed
into
service
discretion
or
no
discretion
madman
they
will
kill
you
if
they
find
you
here
no
woman
ever
loved
a
coward
for
heaven
s
sake
go
away
he
rose
from
his
knees
and
lifted
up
his
frock
the
girl
saw
harness
and
a
sword
beneath
it
this
young
leopard
of
the
southern
shores
had
fettle
enough
and
spirit
he
was
a
mixture
of
imperturbable
determination
and
sanguine
quixotism
as
he
faced
her
under
the
trees
this
dress
is
privileged
my
bell
warns
folk
away
who
would
fall
foul
of
a
miserable
leper
if
this
frock
fails
me
i
have
my
sword
she
looked
at
him
with
the
solemnity
of
a
child
hand
folded
in
hand
i
can
not
understand
you
she
said
not
yet
are
you
the
man
whose
life
i
saved
that
breath
of
death
on
your
brow
messire
should
have
made
you
thoughtful
of
your
soul
let
me
plead
a
moment
for
what
my
honour
why
your
honour
because
i
want
you
to
believe
that
i
have
a
soul
he
was
vastly
earnest
and
his
eyes
followed
her
as
though
she
were
some
being
out
of
heaven
she
had
never
seen
such
a
look
in
a
man
s
eyes
before
it
troubled
her
she
questioned
her
own
heart
laughed
emptily
and
gave
in
to
him
we
are
both
mad
she
said
but
go
on
i
will
listen
for
one
minute
keep
watch
lest
any
one
should
come
upon
us
suddenly
she
sat
down
on
the
grass
bank
while
he
stood
before
her
holding
his
lazar
bell
by
the
clapper
look
at
this
dress
he
said
yes
it
is
how
i
feel
in
soul
when
i
look
at
you
she
frowned
visibly
if
you
wax
personal
messire
i
shall
leave
you
no
no
i
will
keep
to
my
own
carcase
and
play
the
egotist
well
i
will
be
brief
look
at
me
i
am
the
first
lord
in
the
south
master
of
an
army
one
of
the
twelve
knights
of
the
order
of
the
rose
go
on
when
i
was
twenty
years
old
certain
clever
people
found
me
a
wife
a
woman
five
years
my
senior
in
time
twenty
years
my
superior
in
knowledge
of
the
world
well
six
months
had
not
passed
before
i
hated
her
hated
her
with
my
whole
soul
my
god
what
a
thing
for
a
boy
to
begin
life
with
a
woman
who
made
him
half
the
bounden
vassal
of
the
devil
you
seem
generous
the
faults
were
all
on
her
side
madame
i
say
nothing
against
the
woman
only
that
she
had
no
soul
we
were
incompatible
as
day
and
night
fire
and
water
the
thing
crushed
the
youth
out
of
me
made
me
desperate
and
worse
made
me
old
beyond
my
years
i
have
done
my
best
i
have
groped
along
like
a
man
in
the
dark
knowing
nothing
understanding
nothing
save
that
i
had
a
warm
heart
in
me
and
that
life
seemed
one
grim
jest
the
future
had
no
fire
for
me
i
drank
the
wine
of
the
present
strove
to
please
my
senses
plunged
into
the
abysses
of
the
world
sometimes
i
tried
to
pray
sometimes
i
played
the
cynic
the
eternal
beacon
of
love
had
gone
out
of
my
life
i
had
no
sun
no
inspiration
for
my
soul
she
sprang
up
suddenly
breathing
fast
like
one
who
is
near
tears
why
do
you
speak
to
me
of
this
god
knows
his
voice
was
utterly
lonely
what
am
i
to
you
you
have
hardly
seen
me
three
hours
in
your
life
why
do
you
speak
to
me
of
this
he
put
a
hand
to
his
throat
and
did
not
look
at
her
madame
there
are
people
who
come
near
our
hearts
in
one
short
hour
people
who
are
winter
to
us
to
eternity
do
not
ask
me
to
explain
this
truth
as
christ
s
death
i
know
it
to
be
true
i
trust
you
all
the
logicians
of
the
world
could
not
tell
me
why
i
do
not
know
that
i
could
bring
forward
one
single
reason
out
of
my
own
soul
save
that
you
showed
me
great
mercy
once
and
now
and
now
he
broke
down
suddenly
and
could
not
speak
yeoland
appealed
to
him
out
of
the
quickness
of
her
fear
messire
messire
your
promise
let
me
speak
or
i
stifle
go
for
god
s
sake

he
flung
his
hands
towards
her
with
a
great
outburst
of
passion
heaven
and
god
s
throne
you
shall
hear
me
to
the
end

my
soul
flows
to
you

in

a
new

the
stars
are
dust
dust
blown
from
the
coffins
of
the
dead
who
loved

in
me
like
another

xvii
the
lady
duessa
stood
in
the
chapel
of
avalon
with
fra
balthasar
the
dominican
beside
her
she
had
slipped
in
without
his
noticing
her
and
had
watched
him
awhile
in
silence
at
his
work
the
jingling
of
her
chatelaine
had
brought
him
at
last
to
a
consciousness
of
her
presence
now
they
stood
together
before
the
high
altar
and
looked
at
the
madonna
seated
on
her
throne
of
gold
amid
choirs
of
angel
women
the
lady
duessa
s
intelligence
had
waxed
critical
on
the
subject
you
have
altered
the
virgin
s
face
she
said
balthasar
stared
at
his
handiwork
and
nodded
the
former
has
been
erased
the
latter
throned
in
her
stead
the
words
had
more
significance
for
the
lady
than
the
friar
had
perhaps
intended
a
better
woman
would
have
snubbed
him
for
his
pains
as
it
was
he
saw
her
go
red
saw
the
tense
stare
of
her
dark
eyes
the
tightening
of
the
muscles
of
her
jaw
she
had
a
wondrous
strong
jaw
had
the
lady
duessa
she
was
no
mere
puppet
no
fineried
piece
of
plasticity
fra
balthasar
guessed
the
hot
passionate
power
of
her
soul
she
was
the
very
woman
for
the
rough
handling
of
a
cause
such
as
the
lord
flavian
her
husband
had
roused
against
her
i
suppose
she
said
this
alteration
was
a
matter
of
art
balthasar
a
matter
of
heart
madame
so
my
lord
flavian
commanded
it
and
yonder
face
is
taken
from
life
madame
i
leave
the
inference
to
your
charity
she
laughed
a
deep
cynical
laugh
and
went
wandering
round
the
chapel
looking
at
the
frescoes
and
swinging
a
little
poniard
by
the
chain
that
linked
it
to
her
girdle
balthasar
made
a
pretence
of
mixing
colours
on
his
palette
worldly
rogue
that
he
was
he
knew
women
especially
women
of
the
lady
duessa
mould
he
had
a
most
shrewd
notion
as
to
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
morally
he
was
her
abettor
being
a
person
who
could
always
take
a
woman
s
part
provided
she
were
pretty
he
believed
women
had
no
business
with
religion
to
balthasar
like
fine
glass
their
frailty
was
their
most
enhancing
characteristic
it
gave
such
infinite
scope
to
a
discreet
confessor
the
lady
duessa
strolled
back
again
and
stood
by
the
altar
rails
am
i
such
a
plain
woman
she
asked
madame
you
have
never
painted
me
there
are
people
above
the
artist
s
brush
but
you
paint
the
madonna
madame
the
madonna
is
anybody
s
property
am
i
god
forbid
that
a
poet
should
speak
lightly
of
beauty
she
laughed
again
and
touching
her
hair
with
her
fingers
scanned
herself
in
a
little
mirror
that
she
carried
at
her
girdle
tell
me
frankly
am
i
worth
painting
madame
that
purple
hair
those
splendid
eyes
the
superb
colour
of
those
cheeks
would
blaze
out
of
a
golden
background
as
out
of
heaven
she
gave
a
musical
little
titter
heaven
heaven
ha
ha
i
should
be
grateful
for
so
transcendent
a
chance
and
you
would
do
me
justice
where
inspiration
burns
there
art
soars
you
would
be
true
to
the
chiselling
of
a
coral
ear
and
discreet
to
the
curve
of
a
lip
and
considerate
my
hands
are
subtle
and
your
heart
is
ingenuous
as
a
little
child
s
she
laughed
again
and
held
out
her
hands
balthasar
kissed
the
white
fingers
crowded
with
their
gems
his
eyes
were
warm
as
water
in
the
sun
the
colours
and
the
glimmering
richness
of
the
chapel
burnt
into
his
brain
you
shall
paint
me
she
said
here
madame
here
no
my
own
bower
is
pleasanter
you
can
reach
it
by
my
lord
flavian

stair
in

is
the
key

never
uses
it
now

six
days
madame

will
paint
you

before
dame
duessa
s
bower
was
a
broad
chamber
on
the
western
walls
joining
the
tower
a
great
oriel
jewelled
with
heraldic
glass
looked
over
the
mere
with
its
dreaming
lilies
over
the
green
meadows
to
the
solemn
silence
of
the
woods
calypso
s
grotto
the
bower
of
a
luxurious
lady
in
a
luxurious
age
the
snuff
of
ind
and
araby
tingled
in
balthasar
s
nostrils
the
silks
of
china
and

the
cloths
of
italy
bloomed
there
flowers
crowded
the
window
the
couches
every
nook
hangings
warmed
the
walls
the
lady
duessa
sat
to
balthasar
in
the
oriel
with
her
lute
upon
her
bosom
she
was
in
azure
and
violet
with
neck
and
bosom
showing
under
a
maze
of
gossamer
gold
her
arms
were
bare
to
the
shoulder
white
gleaming
arms
subtle
sinuous
voluptuous
her
hair
had
been
powdered
with
gold
her
lips
were
wondrous
red
her
eyes
dark
as
wells
musk
and
lavender
breathed
from
her
samites
her
girdle
glowed
with
precious
stones
fra
balthasar
sat
on
a
stool
inlaid
with
and
ivory
an
embroidery
frame
served
him
as
an
easel
the
man
was
living
under
the
vault
of
beauty
all
the
scent
and
floweriness
of
the
room
played
on
his
brain
all
the
wealth
of
it
pandered
to
his
art
all
the
woman
s
splendour
made
molten
wax
of
his
being
as
he
painted
she
sang
to
him
an
old
lay
of
arthurian
love
so
that
he
might
catch
the
music
in
her
eyes
and
watch
the
deep
notes
gathering
in
her
throat
he
saw
her
bosom
sway
beneath
her
lace
saw
the
inimitable
roundness
of
her
arms
often
his
brush
lingered
he
might
gaze
upon
the
woman
as
he
would
drink
her
beauty
like
so
much
violet
wine
open
his
soul
to
the
opulent
summer
of
her
power
his
heart
was
in
a
sunset
mood
he
lived
the
life
of
a
poet
and
the
green
spring
grew
subtle
sang
the
dame
with
song
of
birds
and
laughter
and
the
woods
were
white
for
maying
so
fair
guinivere
loosed
her
long
hair
like
rivulets
of
gold
that
stream
from
the
broad
casement
of
the
dawn
and
her
sweet
mouth
was
like
one
lovely
rose
and
her
white
bosom
like
a
bowl
of
flowers
so
wandered
she
with
launcelot
while
the
wind
blew
her
long
tresses
to
him
and
her
eyes
were
as
the
tender
azure
of
the
night
of
such
things
sang
duessa
while
the
friar
spread
his
colours
and
then
she
questioned
him
love
you
the
old
legends
balthasar
madame
as
i
love
life
ah
they
could
love
in
those
old
days
madame
men
can
love
even
now
she
put
her
lute
aside
and
knelt
upon
the
couch
before
the
window
with
her
elbows
on
the
cushioned
sill
her
silks
swept
close
upon
her
shapely
back
her
shoulders
gleamed
under
her
purple
hair
in
the
west
the
world
grew
red
the
crimson
kisses
of
the
sunset
poured
upon
the
ecstasied
green
woods
the
mere
was
flaked
with
a
myriad
amber
scales
the
meadows
broidered
their
broad
laps
with
cowslips
as
with
dust
of
gold
balthasar
madame
look
yonder
at
the
sunset
you
must
be
tired
of
gazing
on
my
face
he
rose
up
like
one
dazed
intoxicated
by
colours
sounds
and
odours
duessa
s
hand
beckoned
him
he
went
and
knelt
on
the
couch
at
her
side
and
looked
out
over
the
flaming
woods
and
the
other
woman
she
said
the
other
woman
this
madonna
of
my
lord
s
chapel
yes
she
amuses
me
i
am
not
jealous
what
is
jealousy

me

me
about

it
is
a
pretty
tale

whole

you
are

been
garrulous
to
you
tell
me
the
whole
tale

better
better
my

put
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
stared
straight
into
his
eyes
her
lips
overhung
his
like
ripe
red
fruit
her
arms
were
fragrant
of
myrrh
and
violet
her
bosom
was
white
as

you

xviii
the
girl
yeoland
saw
nothing
of
the
leper
for
a
season
for
several
days
she
did
not
venture
far
into
the
pine
forest
and
the
nameless
grave
heard
not
the
sound
of
her
lute
the
third
night
after
the
incident
as
she
lay
in
her
room
under
her
canopy
of
purple
cloth
she
heard
distinctly
the
silver
clangour
of
a
bell
floating
up
through
the
midnight
silence
she
lay
as
still
as
a
mouse
and
scarcely
drew
breath
for
fear
the
man
in
grey
should
venture
up
the
stairway
the
casement
was
open
with
a
soft
june
air
blowing
in
like
peace
the
bell
continued
to
tinkle
but
less
noisily
till
it
vanished
into
silence
other
folk
from
the
cliff
had
seen
the
leper
and
yeoland
could
not
claim
to
have
monopolised
the
gentleman
one
of
fulviac
s
fellows
had
seen
him
one
morning
near
the
cliff
gliding
like
a
grey
ghost
among
the
pines
another
had
marked
him
creeping
swiftly
away
through
the
twilight
it
was
a
superstitious
age
and
a
superstitious
region
the
figure
in
grey
seemed
to
haunt
the
place
with
the
occasional
and
mournful
sounding
of
its
bell
men
began
to
gossip
as
the
ignorant
always
will
fulviac
himself
grew
uneasy
for
more
material
reasons
and
contemplated
the
test
of
a
clothyard
shaft
or
a
bolt
upon
the
leper
s
body
the
man
might
be
a
spy
and
if
the
bolt
missed
its
mark
it
would
at
least
serve
as
a
sinister
hint
to
this
troublesome
apparition
it
was
then
that
yeoland
took
alarm
into
her
woman
s
heart
there
was
great
likelihood
of
the
man
ending
his
days
under
the
tree
with
a
shaft
sticking
fast
between
his
shoulders
though
he
was
something
of
a
madman
she
did
not
relish
such
a
prospect
the
day
after
she
had
heard
the
bell
at
midnight
near
the
stair
she
haunted
the
forest
like
a
pixie
keeping
constant
watch
between
the
cliff
and
the
forest
grave
fulviac
had
ridden
out
on
a
plundering
venture
and
she
was
free
of
him
for
the
day
it
was
not
till
evening
that
she
heard
the
faint
signal
of
the
bell
creeping
down
through
the
boughs
like
the
sound
of
a
distant
angelus
the
sound
flew
from
the
north
and
beckoned
her
towards
the
forest
grave
fearful
of
being
caught
she
followed
it
as
fast
as
her
feet
could
carry
her
while
the
deepening
clamour
led
her
on
presently
she
called
the
man
by
name
as
she
ran
his
grey
frock
and
cowl
came
dimly
through
the
trees
at
last
you
are
merciful
was
his
greeting
she
stood
still
and
twisted
her
gown
restlessly
between
her
two
hands
anarchy
showed
in
her
face
fear
reason
and
desire
were
calling
to
her
heart
the
intangible
touch
of
the
man
s
soul
threw
her
being
into
chaos
she
feared
greatly
for
him
stood
still
and
could
say
nothing
flavian
put
his
cowl
back
and
stood
aloof
from
her
looking
in
her
face
seemingly
we
are
both
embarrassed
he
said
she
made
a
petulant
little
gesture
he
forestalled
her
in
speech
it
is
best
to
be
frank
when
life
runs
deep
i
will
speak
the
truth
to
you
and
you
may
treat
me
as
you
will
yeoland
leant
against
a
tree
and
began
to
pull
away
the
brittle
scales
of
the
bark
if
you
stay
here
longer
messire
she
began
well
madame
what
then
you
will
be
shot
like
a
dog
you
are
suspected
they
are
going
to
try
your
leper
s
gown
with
a
crossbow
bolt
the
man
smiled
optimistically
and
you
came
to
tell
me
this
yes
i
thank
you
the
wind
moved
through
the
trees
a
came
pattering
through
the
branches
and
fell
at
their
feet
on
the
cliff
a
horn
blared
its
throaty
cry
came
echoing
faintly
through
the
trees
flavian
looked
towards
the
gold
of
the
west
his
mood
was
calm
and
deliberate
he
had
his
enthusiasms
in
leash
for
the
moment
for
there
were
more
mundane
matters
in
his
mind
matters
that
were
not
savoury
however
crimson
shone
the
ideal
years
i
have
thrown
down
the
glove
he
said
for
good
or
evil
honour
or
dishonour
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
truth
yeoland
watching
his
face
felt
her
impatient
dreads
goad
her
to
the
quick
will
you
talk
for
ever

said
to
him
take
the
core
then
i
am
going
to
rend
my
bonds
as
i
would
rend
flax

have
appealed
to

have
poured
out
gold
to
the
point
messire
i
shall
divorce
my
wife
he
threw
his
head
back
and
challenged
the
world
in
her
one
person
her
good
favour
was
more
to
him
than
the
patronage
of
pope
or
king
it
was
in
his
mind
that
she
should
believe
the
worst
of
him
from
the
beginning
so
that
in
some
later
season
he
might
not
emulate
lucifer
toppled
out
of
the
heaven
of
her
heart
she
should
have
the
truth
from
the
first
and
build
her
opinion
of
him
on
no
fanciful
basis
even
in
this
justice
to
the
more
sinister
side
of
his
surroundings
he
was
an
idealist
thorough
and
enthusiastic
so
you
must
understand
madame
that
i
am
not
without
blemishes
not
without
things
that
i
myself
would
rather
see
otherwise
with
me
it
is
a
question
of
going
to
hell
for
a
woman
or
getting
rid
of
her
being
an
egotist
i
choose
the
latter
alternative
yeoland
still
evaded
his
eyes
and
the
woman
loves
you
not
an
atom
she
only
cares
to
be
called
the
lady
of
gambrevault
signoress
of
avalon
the
first
dame
in
the
south
why
do
you
tell
me
this
madame
have
i
need
of
more
words
it
is
for
this
that
you
might
not
picture
me
as
i
am
not
or
form
any
false
conception
of
me
i
have
bared
my
moral
skeleton
to
you
perhaps
you
will
never
know
what
it
costs
a
man
at
times
to
make
his
mind
as
glass
to
the
woman
he
honours
above
the
whole
world
well
it
is
because
i
honour
you
that
i
have
goaded
myself
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
her
verdict
was
more
sudden
and
more
human
than
he
might
have
expected
messire
you
are
a
brave
man
she
said
i
believe
i
am
beginning
to
trust
you
the
sky
flamed
into
sunset
the
tracery
of
the
trees
seemed
webbed
with
gold
into
shimmering
domes
and
fans
of
quivering
light
in
the
distance
the
great
cliff
stood
out
darkly
from
the
scarlet
caverns
of
the
west
the
pine
tops
rose
like
the
black
spires
of
some
vast
city
above
floated
clouds
effulgent
mounts
of
fire
hurled
from
the
abysmal
furnace
of
the
sun
flavian
came
two
steps
nearer
to
the
woman
leaning
against
the
tree
give
me
my
due
he
said
i
have
uncovered
the
difficult
workings
of
my
heart
i
have
shown
you
the
inner
man
in
his
meaner
mould
suffer
me
to
speak
of
my
manhood
in
godlier
words
i
have
shown
you
winter
let
me
utter
forth
spring
yeoland
turned
and
faced
him
at
last
you
have
risked
your
life
and
my
honour
long
enough
she
said
i
am
going
back
to
the
cliff
and
i
with
you
as
far
as
the
stairway
to
the
threshold
of
death
what
care
i
if
i
tread
it
at
your
side
she
turned
homewards
with
obstinate
intent
and
the
mild
hauteur
of
a
good
woman
the
man
followed
her
went
with
her
step
for
step
looking
in
her
face
hear
my
confession
he
said
you
shall
have
it
before
you
leave
me
for
the
sake
of
your
honour
i
hold
my
soul
by
the
collar
but
but
i
shall
win
liberty
liberty
when
i
am
free
ah
girl
girl
i
shall
flash
golden
wings
in
the
face
of
the
sun
i
shall
soar
to
you
that
i
may
look
into
your
eyes
that
i
may
touch
your
hands
and
breathe
the
warm
summer
of
your
soul
i
want
god
i
want
purity
i
want
the
eternal
peace
i
want
your
heart
i
have
said
the
whole
think
of
me
what
you
will
twilight
had
gathered
all
the
violet
calmness
of
the
night
came
down
upon
the
world
under
the
shadows
of
the
tall
trees
the
girl
was
deeply
stirred
beyond
her
own
compassion
she
halted
hesitated
went
suddenly
near
the
man
with
her
face
turned
heavenwards
like
a
flower
her
eyes
were
very
wistful
and
she
spoke
almost
in
a
whisper
you
have
told
me
the
whole
truth
you
have
shown
me
your
whole
soul
as
i
serve
you
madame
i
have
kept
nothing
back
ah
messire
i
will
speak
to
you
the
truth
in
turn
god
be
merciful
to
me
but
you
have
come
strangely
near
my
heart
these
are
bitter
words
for
my
soul
ah
messire
if
you
have
any
honour
for
me
trust
me
that
i
aspire
to
heaven
i
can
not
suffer
you
to
come
deeper
into
my
life
the
man
held
out
his
hands
why
why
because
in
following
me
you
go
innocently
to
your
death
he
lifted
up
his
arms
and
leapt
into
heroics
like
an
apollo
leaping
into
a
sky
what
care
i
you
speak
in
riddles
can
i
fear
death
messire
messire
it
is
the
woman
who
fears
i
tell
you
this
because
because
god
help
me
she
fled
away
but
that
night
he
did
not
follow
her
xix
as
a
wind
sweeps
clamorous
into
a
wood
so
modred
and
his
fellows
household
knights
streamed
into
the
great
hall
of
avalon
where
the
lord
flavian
sat
at
supper
bearers
of
angry
steel
fulminators
of
vengeance
vociferous
strong
they
poured
in
through
the
screens
like
a
mill
race
bearing
a
tossed
and
impotent
figure
in
their
midst
their
swords
yelped
and
flashed
over
this
bruised
fragment
of
humanity
a
gauntlet
of
steel
was
dashed
often
into
the
white
face
hands
clawed
his
collar
clutched
his
body
dragged
jerked
onwards
buffeted
beaten
to
his
knees
he
sank
down
before
the
lord
flavian
s
chair
blood
streaming
from
his
mouth
and
nostrils
specking
his
white
habit
drabbling
the
floor
then
only
did
the
flashing
growling
circle
recede
like
waves
from
a
fallen
rock
modred
a
black
man
burly
a
bigot
to
honour
stood
out
a
giant
before
his
fellows
his
great
sword
quivered
to
the
roof
his
deep
voice
shook
the
rafters

in

quailed
and

me
smite
him
as

give
me
the
courtesy
of
silence
flavian
started
from
his
chair
and
looked
at
the
man
who
knelt
huddled
into
himself
at
his
feet
it
was
a
scene
replete
with
the
grim
cynicism
of
life
here
was
a
man
of
mind
and
genius
cowering
quivering
before
the
strong
wrath
of
a
dozen
muscular
illiterates
here
was
the
promulgator
of
bold
truths
an
utter
dastard
when
the
physical
part
of
him
was
threatened
with
dissolution
not
that
this
event
was
any
proof
against
the
moral
power
of
pagan
not
that
there
was
any
cause
for
the
bleating
of
sanctimonious
platitudes
or
the
pointing
of
a
proverb
a
true
churchman
might
have
carved
a
fine
moral
fable
out
of
the
reality
it
would
have
been
a
fallacy
fra
balthasar
was
a
coward
he
had
none
of
the
splendid
mental
anatomy
of
a
socrates
he
would
have
played
the
coward
even
under
the
eye
of
christ
silence
had
fallen
far
away
choked
by
the
long
throats
of
gallery
and
stair
rose
the
wild
passionate
screaming
of
a
woman
it
had
the
rebellious
blasphemous
agony
of
one
flung
into
eternal
fire
without
modulation
abatement
or
increase
malevolent
impotent
ferocious
piteous
it
pealed
out
in
long
tempestuous
bursts
that
swept
into
the
ears
like
some
unutterable
discord
out
of
hell
the
kneeling
man
heard
it
and
seemed
to
contract
to
shrink
into
himself
his
white
habit
was
rent
to
the
middle
his
ashy
face
splashed
over
with
blood
he
tottered
and
shook
his
hands
clasped
over
the
nape
of
his
neck
for
fear
of
the
sword
his
tongue
clave
to
his
palate
his
eyes
were
furtively
fixed
on
the
upreared
yard
of
steel
torches
and
cressets
flared
servants
stared
and
shouldered
and
gaped
in
the
screens
all
the
castle
underlings
seemed
to
have
smelt
out
the
business
like
the
rats
they
were
modred

them
out
with
rough
words
and
the
flat
of
the
sword
the
doors
were
barred
only
flavian
the
priest
and
modred
and
his
men
took
part
in
that
tribunal
in
the
hall
of
avalon
flavian
stood
and
gazed
on
balthasar
the
man
of
tones
and
colours
the
lord
of
gambrevault
was
calm
unhurried
and
dispassionate
yet
not
unpleased
the
man
s
infinite
abasement
and
terror
seemed
to
arrest
him
like
some
superb
precept
from
the
lips
of
a
philosopher
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
calculates
the
look
of
a
diplomat
whose
scheme
has
worked
out
well
from
balthasar
he
looked
to
modred
the
strong
the
torchlight
lurid
on
his
armour
his
great
sword
quivering
like
a
falcon
to
leap
down
upon
its
prey
the
distant
screaming
somewhat
fainter
and
less
resolute
still
throbbed
in
his
ears
he
thought
of
dante
and
the
of
that
superhuman
singer
going
close
to
the
dominican
he
spoke
to
him
in
strong
yet
not
unpitying
tones
balthasar
dared
not
look
above
the
lord
flavian
s
knees
ha
my
friend
where
is
all
your
fine
philosophy
the
man
cringed
like
a
beggar
where
are
all
your
sonorous
phrases
your
pert
blasphemies
your
subtleties
your
fine
tinsel
of
intellect
and
vanity
balthasar
had
no
word
where
is
your
godliness
my
friend
where
your
glowing
and
superhuman
soul
have
we
found
you
out
o
satanas
have
we
shocked
your
pagan
heroism
be
a
man
stand
up
and
face
us
you
could
hold
forth
roundly
on
occasions
even
that
saul
of
tarsus
was
not
afraid
of
a
sword
balthasar
cowered
and
hid
his
face
behind
his
hands
he
began
to
whimper
to
rock
to
and
fro
to
sob
the
grim
men
round
him
laughed
iron
scoffing
laughter
modred
pricked
the
priest
s
neck
with
the
point
of
his
sword
it
was
then
that
balthasar
fell
forward
upon
his
face
senseless
from
sheer
terror
flavian
abandoned
philosophic
irony
and
addressed
himself
to
modred
and
his
knights
put
up
your
swords
sirs
this
man
shall
go
free
sire
sire
came
the
massed
cry
trust
my
discretion
the
fellow
has
done
me
the
greatest
service
of
my
life
sire
he
has
given
me
liberty
he
has
gnawed
the
shackles
from
my
soul
you
are
all
my
witnesses
in
this
and
may
count
upon
my
gratitude
but
this
man
here
he
has
danced
to
my
whim
like
a
doll
plucked
by
a
string
for
my
liberty
has
he
sinned
out
of
avalon
shall
he
go
scatheless
the
men
still
murmured
modred
shot
home
his
sword
into
its
scabbard
with
a
vicious
snap
flavian
read
their
humour
do
not
imagine
gentlemen
he
said
that
your
vigilance
and
your
loyalty
to
my
honour
can
go
unrewarded

heavily
mortgaged

hundred
golden
angels

and
now
sirs
as
to
madame
my
wife
they
gathered
round
him
in
curious
conclave
balthasar
lying
in
their
midst
sir

order
out
my
state
litter
set
the
lady
duessa
therein
and

her
borne
with
all
courtesy

house
then
you
will
take
these
gentlemen
who
are
my
true
friends
and
witnesses
and
you
will
ride
to
lauretia
to
make
solemn
declaration
before
bishop
hilary
he
has
already
received
my
earlier
embassage
after
this
affair
we
have
no
need
of
ethical
subtleties
and
clerical
conveniences
you
will
obtain
a
dispensation
at
his
hands
vinculo
nothing
less
than
that
they
bowed
to
him
and
his
commands
like
the
loyal
gentlemen
they
were
modred
pointed
to
the
prostrate
balthasar
who
was
already
squirming
back
to
consciousness
with
his
fingers
feeling
at
his
throat
as
though
to
discover
whether
it
was
still
sound
or
no
and
this
fellow
sire
pick
him
up
balthasar
had
found
his
tongue
at
last
he
was
jerked
to
his
feet
and
held
up
by
force
with
the
handle
of
a
poniard
rammed
into
his
mouth
to
stem
his
garrulity
flavian
read
him
an
extemporary
lecture
there
was
something
like
a
smile
hovering
about
his
lips
go
back
to
your
missal
man
and
forswear
women
they
are
like
strong
wine
too
much
for
your
flimsy
brain
i
have
more
pity
for
you
than
censure
say
to
yourself
when
you
patter
your
prayers
flavian
of
gambrevault
saved
me
from
the
devil
and
yet
my
good
saint
i
have
a
shrewd
notion
that
you
will
be
just
as
great
a
fool
two
months
hence
the
man
gave
a
scream
of
delight
and
attempted
to
throw
himself
at
flavian
s
feet
his
superlative
joy
was
almost
ludicrous
half
a
dozen
hands
dragged
him
back
take
him
away
who
cares
for
such
gratitude
as
they
marched
him
off
he
broke
like
an
imbecile
into
hysterical
laughter
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes
he
mopped
his
face
with
the
corner
of
his
habit
laughed
and
snivelled
and
sang
snatches
of
tavern
ditties
so
with
many
a
grim
jest
they
cuffed
fra
balthasar
out
of
avalon
at
the
end
of
the
drama
flavian
called
for
tapers
and
marched
in
state
to
the
chapel
he
knelt
before
the
altar
and
prayed
to
the
madonna
whose
face
was
the
face
of
the
girl
yeoland
xx
fulviac
i
can
not
fasten
all
these
buckles
the
man
waited
at
the
door
of
her
room
and
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
in
his
eyes
she
stood
by
the
window
in
gothic
armour
of
a
grandly
simple
type
no
maximilian
flutings
no
damascening
the
simple
gothic
at
its
grandest
nothing
more
her
with
salient
ridge
was
blazoned
over
with
golden
the
pauldrons
were
slightly
ridged
and
were
beautifully
jointed
with
most
quaint
she
wore
a
great
brayette
a
short
skirt
of
mail
but
no
tassets
in
place
of
cuishes
jambs
and
solerets
she
had
a
kirtle
of
white
cloth
and
laced
leather
shoes
it
was
light
work
and
superbly
wrought
fulviac
had
paid
many
crowns
for
it
from
an
armourer
at
geraint
her
beauty
mailed
and
cased
in
steel
seemed
to
shine
upon
the
man
with
a
new
glory
when
he
had
played
the
armourer
she
stood
and
looked
at
him
with
a
most
conscious
modesty
a
warm
colour
in
her
cheeks
eyes
full
of
tremulous
light
her
masses
of
dark
hair
rolling
down
over
her
blazoned
cuirass
a
hand
and
a
half
sword
in
a
gilded
scabbard
a
rich
baldric
and
a
light
bassinet
lay
on
the
oak
table
fulviac
took
the
sword
and
belted
it
to
her
and
slung
the
baldric
over
her
shoulder
his
hands
moved
through
her
dark
hair
for
a
moment
her
eyes
trembled
up
at
him
under
their
long
lashes
he
gave
the
helmet
into
her
hands
but
she
did
not
wear
it
a
sudden
gust
of
youth
seized
the
man
an
old
strain
of
chivalry
woke
in
his
heart
grizzled
and
gaunt
he
went
on
his
knees
in
front
of
her
and
held
up
his
hands
as
in
prayer
there
was
a
warm
light
in
his
eyes
the
mother
virgin
keep
you
little
woman
may
all
peril
be
far
from
your
heart
all
trouble
far
from
your
soul
may
my
arm
ever
ward
you
my
sword
guard
your
womanhood
all
the
saints
watch
over
you
may
the
spirit
of
god
abide
with
you
in
my
heart
it
was
a
true
prayer
though
fulviac
stumbled
up
from
his
knees
looking
much
like
an
awkward
boy
he
was
blushing
under
his
tanned
skin
blushing
scarred
and
battered
worldling
that
he
was
for
his
heart
still
showed
gold
to
the
knife
of
time
yeoland
thought
more
of
him
that
moment
than
she
had
done
these
four
months
a
shadow
passed
over
her
face
and
she
touched
her
forehead
with
her
hand
fulviac
a
look
in
his
eyes
was
furling
her
great
scarlet
banner
upon
its
staff
yeoland
spoke
to
him
over
her
shoulder
i
am
in
your
hands
she
said
fulviac
smoothed
out
a
crease
what
is
your
will
you
have
not
yet
enlightened
me
he
looked
at
her
gravely
for
a
moment
you
are
ours
he
said
a
woman
given
to
us
by
heaven
he
hesitated
as
over
a
lie
you
are
to
shine
out
a
star
a
pillar
of
fire
before
the
host
every
man
who
follows
you
will
know
your
story
every
man
who
follows
you
will
worship
you
in
his
heart
you
will
inspire
us
as
no
mere
man
could
inspire
your
banner
will
wave
on
heroes
patriots
you
will
play
the
comet
with
an
army
for
your
tail
some
sudden
emotion
seemed
to
sweep
over
her
she
stood
motionless
with
clasped
hands
looking
at
her
crucifix
there
was
a
strange
sadness
upon
her
face
a
tragic
sanctity
as
on
the
face
of
a
woman
who
renounces
the
world
and
more
for
a
long
while
she
was
silent
as
though
suffering
some
lustre
light
out
of
heaven
to
stream
into
her
heart
presently
she
answered
fulviac
god
help
me
to
be
strong
she
said
god
help
me
to
bear
the
burden
he
has
put
upon
my
soul
amen
little
woman
and
now
prosper
is
preaching
to
all
our
men
upon
the
cliff
he
is
telling
them
your
story
i
take
you
now
to
set
you
before
them
all
that
they
may
look
upon
a
living
saint
i
leave
the
rest
to
your
soul
god
will
tell
you
how
to
bear
yourself
in
the
cause
of
the
people
come
let
us
pray
a
moment
they
knelt
down
side
by
side
before
the
crucifix
like
effigies
on
a
tomb
fulviac
s
face
was
in
shadow
yeoland
s
turned
heavenward
to
the
cross
it
was
her
renunciation
then
they
arose
fulviac
took
up
the
scarlet
banner
and
they
passed
out
together
from
the
room
traversing
parlour
and
finding
them
empty
and
silent
as
a
church
they
came
by
the
winding
stairway
in
the
rock
to
the
hollow
opening
upon
the
platform
above
two
sentinels
stood
by
the
rough
door
above
and
around
great
stones
had
been
piled
up
so
as
to
form
a
species
of
natural
battlement
fulviac
bearing
the
banner
climbed
the
rocks
and
signed
to
yeoland
to
follow
they
were
still
within
a
kind
of
rude
tower
walled
in
by
heaped
blocks
of
stone
on
every
side
they
were
alone
save
for
the
two
sentinels
above
they
saw
prosper
the
preacher
standing
on
a
great
square
mass
of
rock
his
tall
figure
outlined
against
the
sky
they
could
see
that
the
man
was
borne
along
by
the
strong
spirit
of
the
preacher
his
arms
tossed
to
the
sky
as
he
bent
forward
and
preached
to
those
invisible
to
fulviac
and
the
girl
his
oratory
was
of
a
fervid
strenuous
type
like
fire
leaping
in
a
wind
fierce
mobile
passionate
they
could
see
him
stride
to
and
fro
on
his
platform
gesticulate
point
to
heaven
smite
his
bosom
strike
attitudes
of
ecstasy
his
voice
rang
out
the
while
full
of
subtle
modulations
the
pathetic
abandonments
the
supreme
outbursts
of
the
orator
much
that
he
said
fell
deep
into
the
girl
s
heart
the
man
had
that
strange
power
that
magnetic
influence
that
exists
in
the
individual
defying
analysis
yet
real
as
the
stirring
witchery
of
great
music
or
as
the
voice
of
the
sea
anon
they
saw
him
fall
upon
his
knees
and
lift
his
hands
to
the
heavens
he
had
cast
a
quick
glance
backward
over
his
shoulder
prosper
had
soared
to
his
zenith
he
had
his
men
listening
as
for
the
climax
of
some
great
epic
fulviac
thrust
yeoland
forward
up
the
slope
she
understood
the
dramatic
pause
in
an
instant
prosper
s
words
had
been
like
the
orisons
of
birds
preluding
the
dawn
she
climbed
the
rocks
and
stepped
out
at
the
kneeling
monk
s
side
the
scene
below
dazed
her
for
the
moment
many
hundred
faces
were
turned
to
her
from
the
slopes
at
her
feet
innumerable
eyes
seemed
fixed
upon
her
with
a
mesmeric
stare
she
saw
the
whole
cliff
below
her
packed
with
men
every
rock
crowned
with
humanity
even
the
pine
trees
had
their
living
burden
she
saw
swords
waving
like
innumerable
streaks
of
light
she
had
a
confused
vision
of
fanaticism
exultation
power
deep
seemed
calling
unto
deep
a
noise
like
the
noise
of
breakers
was
in
her
ears
then
the
whole
grew
clear
on
the
instant
the
sky
seemed
strangely
luminous
every
outline
in
the
landscape
took
marvellous
and
intelligent
meaning
strange
promethean
fire
flashed
down
into
her
brain
she
felt
her
heart
leaping
her
blood
bounding
through
her
body
yet
her
mind
shone
clear
as
a
crystal
grael
below
her
she
had
humanity
plastic
inflammable
tinder
to
her
touch
an
infinite
realisation
of
power
seemed
to
leap
in
her
as
at
the
beck
of
some
spirit
wand
she
felt
all
the
dim
heroism
of
dreams
glowing
in
her
like
wine
given
of
the
gods
holy
fire
burnt
on
her
forehead
and
her
tongue
was
loosed
she
stood
out
on
the
great
rock
her
armour
flashing
in
the
sun
her
face
bright
as
the
moon
in
her
strength
her
voice
clear
and
silvery
carried
far
over
cliff
and
wood
for
the
day
was
temperate
and
without
a
wind
look
upon
me
well
i
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
she
to
whom
the
madonna
appeared
from
heaven
great
silence
answered
her
the
silence
of
awe
not
of
disbelief
or
disapprobation
her
voice
rang
solitary
as
the
voice
of
a
in
the
wilderness
the
huddled
men
below
were
silent
as
children
whose
solemn
eyes
watch
a
priest
before
the
altar
she
spoke
on
i
am
she
whose
tale
you
have
heard
god
has
given
me
to
the
cause
of
the
poor
to
your
babes
and
to
your
womenfolk
i
lift
my
hands
from
the
mother
of
jesus
i
hold
my
command
men
of
the
land
will
you
believe
and
follow
my
banner
a
thousand
hands
leapt
to
the
sun
yet
hardly
a
voice
broke
the
silence
the
calm
as
of
supreme
revelation
all
the
simple
mediÃ¦val
faith
shone
in
the
rough
faces
all
the
quaint
reverence
the
unflinching
fidelity
of
the
unlettered
of
the
age
shone
in
their
hearts
they
were
warm
earth
to
the
seed
of
faith
men
of
the
land
i
hear
great
noise
of
violence
and
wrong
of
hunger
and
despair
your
lords
crush
you
your
priests
go
in
jewels
and
fine
linen
and
preach
not
the
cross
your
babes
are
slaves
even
before
they
see
the
light
your
children
like
brute
beasts
are
bound
to
the
soil
men
of
the
land
give
me
your
strength
give
me
your
strength
for
the
cause
of
god
she
drew
her
sword
from
its
sheath
pressed
the
blade
to
her
lips
held
it
up
to
heaven
her
voice
rang
over
rock
and
tree
justice
and
liberty
her
shrill
hail
seemed
to
lift
the
silence
from
a
thousand
throats
the
human
sea
below
gave
up
its
soul
to
her
with
thundering
surges
and
vast
sound
of
faith
as
roar
followed
roar
she
stood
a
bright
silvery
pinnacle
above
the
black
fanaticism
beneath
transcendent
hope
holding
her
sword
to
the
eternal
sun
behind
her
fulviac
unwrapped
the
great
scarlet
banner
she
had
wrought
its
cross
of
gold
gleamed
out
as
he
lifted
the
staff
with
both
hands
prosper
erect
and
exultant
stood
pointing
to
its
device
then
in
sight
of
all
men
he
bowed
down
before
the
girl
and
kissed
her
feet
as
though
she
had
been
some
rare
messenger
out
of
heaven
xxi
the
day
had
done
gloriously
till
noon
but
the
sky
s
mood
changed
as
evening
advanced
clouds
were
huddled
up
in
grey
masses
by
a
gathering
and
gusty
wind
and
the
june
calm
took
flight
like
a
girl
in
a
new
gown
when
rain
threatens
by
nightfall
a
storm
held
orgy
over
the
cliff
billow
upon
billow
of
wind
came
roaring
over
the
myriad
trees
the
pines
were
sweeping
a
murky
sky
with
their
black
brooms
creaking
and
moaning
in
chorus
rain
rattled
heavily
and
over
the
cliff
the
storm
thundered
and
cried
with
the
long
wail
of
the
wind
over
rock
and
tree
in
yeoland
s
chamber
the
lamp
flared
and
smoked
and
the
postern
clattered
rain
splashed
upon
the
shivering
casement
the
carpet
breathed
restlessly
with
the
draught
under
the
door
it
was
late
yet
the
girl
was
still
at
her
devotions
her
thoughts
were
dishevelled
and
full
of
discords
while
between
her
fingers
the
beads
of
her
rosary
moved
listlessly
and
her
prayers
were
broken
by
the
anathemas
of
the
storm
the
dual
distractions
of
life
had
come
in
her
to
grappling
point
again
she
could
boast
no
omnipotence
in
her
own
heart
and
could
but
give
countenance
to
one
of
the
two
factions
that
clamoured
for
her
favour
as
her
mood
changed
like
the
mood
of
a
fickle
despot
none
too
sure
of
his
throne
so
tumult
and
despair
were
let
loose
time
after
time
into
the
echoing
courts
and
alleys
of
her
soul
she
had
neither
the
courage
nor
the
force
of
will
for
the
moment
to
compel
herself
either
to
satisfy
her
womanhood
or
sacrifice
her
instincts
to
a
religious
conviction
man
and
god
held
each
a
half
of
her
being
the
man
s
face
outstared
god
s
face
god
s
law
overshadowed
the
man
s
she
had
been
carried
into
the
palpitating
azure
of
religious
exaltation
the
world
had
rolled
at
her
feet
she
had
bathed
her
forehead
in
the
infinite
forethought
of
eternity
she
had
heard
the
stupendous
sounding
of
the
spheres
then
some
mischievous
sprite
had
plucked
the
wings
from
her
shoulders
and
she
had
fallen
far
into
an
abyss
after
spiritual
exaltation
comes
physical
depression
neither
is
a
normal
state
neither
strictly
sane
to
the
intellect
she
had
trod
the
waves
faith
had
played
her
false
the
waters
had
gone
over
her
soul
as
she
knelt
brooding
before
her
crucifix
under
the
wavering
lamp
she
was
smitten
into
listening
immobility
her
rosary
idle
in
her
hand
a
cry
had
come
to
her
amid
the
multitudinous
voices
of
the
storm
a
cry
like
a
hail
from
a
ship
over
a
tumbling
sea
at
night
she
waited
and
wondered
again
the
cry
rose
above
the
babel
of
the
wind
was
it
from
fulviac
s
room
or
a
sentinel
s
shout
from
the
cliff
seized
upon
and
carried
by
the
wind
with
distorting
vehemence
midnight
covered
the
world
and
the
girl
was
in
an
impressionable
mood
she
took
the
lamp
from
its
bracket
and
opening
the
door
peered
down
the
gallery
that
led
to
fulviac
s
room
a
sudden
sinister
sound
made
her
start
back
into
the
room
the
lamp
flashing
tremulous
beams
upon
the
walls
and
striking
confusion
into
the
shadows
a
hand
was
beating
heavily
upon
the
postern
she
set
the
lamp
in
its
bracket
crept
to
the
door
put
her
ear
to
the
lock
and
listened
the
knocking
had
ceased
and
in
a
momentary
lulling
of
the
wind
she
even
fancied
she
could
hear
the
sound
of
deep
breathing
her
heart
was
hurrying
but
suspense
emboldened
her
who
s
there
a
sudden
gust
made
such
a
bluster
that
her
voice
died
almost
unheard
in
the
night
there
was
a
vague
clangour
without
as
of
arms
and
the
knocking
sullenly
through
the
room
a
lull
came
again
who
knocks
this
time
an
answer
came
back
to
her
i
flavian
she
caught
her
breath
and
shivered
what
do
you
want
at
midnight
and
in
such
a
storm
let
me
in
open
to
me
no
no
open
to
me
are
you
still
mad
silence
held
a
moment
then
the
voice
rose
again
with
the
hoarse
moan
of
the
wind
for
an
underchant
liberty
liberty
i
am
free
i
am
free
she
shrank
aside
against
the
wall
the
night
gave
me
my
chance
i
have
men
in
the
wood
let
me
in
ah
messire
i
plead
for
love
and
my
own
soul
i
come
to
give
you
life
sword
all
i
can
not
leave
you
i
am
in
outer
darkness
you
are
in
heaven
let
me
in
she
stood
swaying
like
a
reed
in
a
breeze
her
brain
glowed
like
some
rich
scheme
of
colour
some
garden
the
massed
moan
of
a
hundred
viols
seemed
to
sweep
over
her
soul
god
for
the
courage
to
be
weak
yeoland
yeoland
have
you
no
word
for
me
her
hand
trembled
to
the
door
her
fingers
closed
upon
the
key
she
hesitated
and
her
dangling
rosary
caught
her
glance
sudden
revulsions
of
purpose
flooded
back
she
stumbled
away
from
the
door
like
one
about
to
faint
i
can
not
i
can
not
she
said
i
will
break
down
the
door
the
threat
inspired
her
no
no
not
thus
can
you
win
me
i
will
break
in
attempt
it
and
i
will
call
the
guard
you
will
lose
hope
of
me
for
ever
i
swear
it
her
voice
rang
true
and
strong
as
a
sword
with
her
judgment
silence
fell
again
and
ages
seemed
to
crawl
over
the
world
when
the
man
spoke
again
his
voice
was
less
masterful
more
pathetic
have
you
no
hope
for
me
it
said
i
have
given
you
life
what
is
life
without
love
she
sighed
very
bitterly
messire
you
do
not
understand
she
said
no
you
are
a
riddle
to
me
a
riddle
that
you
may
read
anon
time
will
show
you
the
truth
i
tell
you
i
am
given
to
god
only
in
one
way
can
you
win
me
are
you
solemn
over
this
solemn
as
death
tell
me
that
only
way
only
by
breaking
the
bonds
about
my
soul
by
liberating
me
from
myself
by
battle
and
through
perils
that
you
can
not
tell
war
and
the
sword
yet
not
you
would
need
ten
thousand
men
to
take
me
from
this
cliff
i
advise
you
for
your
good
only
by
great
power
and
the
sword
can
you
win
your
desire
by
god
then
let
it
be
war
an
utter
sense
of
loneliness
flooded
over
her
she
sobbed
in
her
throat
leant
against
the
door
listened
waited
the
wind
roared
without
the
rain
beat
upon
the
quaking
casement
and
she
heard
the
multitudinous
moaning
of
the
pines
no
voice
companioned
her
and
the
night
was
void
a
sudden
access
of
passion
prompted
her
she
twisted
at
the
key
tore
the
bolts
aside
flung
the
door
open
the
stairway
was
empty
rain
whirled
in
her
face
as
she
stood
out
in
the
wind
and
called
the
man
many
times
by
name
it
was
vain
and
to
no
purpose
presently
she
the
room
very
slowly
and
barred
the
door
her
rosary
rolled
under
her
feet
she
picked
it
up
suddenly
and
dashed
it
away
into
a
corner
the
face
on
the
crucifix
seemed
to
leer
at
her
from
the
wall

iii

aurelius
physician
of
gilderoy
flourished
on
the
fatness
of
a
fortunate
reputation
he
was
a
rubicund
soul
clean
and
pleasant
with
a
beard
and
a
brow
that
seemed
to
dome
a
very
various
and
abundant
wisdom
he
combined
a
sprightly
humour
and
an
enlivening
presence
with
the
reverent
solemnity
necessary
to
his
profession
as
for
the
ladies
of
gilderoy
they
reverenced
master
aurelius
with
a
loyalty
that
became
perhaps
less
remarkable
the
more
one
considered
the
character
of
the
worthy
charlatan
aurelius
was
an
Ã¦sculap
in
court
clothing
he
was
ignorant
but
as
no
one
realised
the
fact
the
soul
of
hippocrates
would
have
been
wasted
in
his
body
discretion
was
his
crowning
virtue
he
was
so
sage
so
intelligent
so
full
of
a
simple
understanding
for
the
ways
of
women
that
the
frail
creatures
could
not
love
him
enough
the
confidences
granted
to
a
priest
were
nothing
compared
to
the
truths
that
were
unmasked
to
his
tactful
ken
the
physician
is
the
priest
of
the
body

privileged
person

he
sees
many
strange
truths
beholds
fine
and
wonderful
transfigurations
presides
over
the
confessional
of
the
flesh
and
aurelius
never
whispered
of
these
mysteries
never
displayed
astonishment
always
discovered
extraordinary
justification
for
the
quaintest
inconsistencies
the
most
romantic
failings
he
carried
a
sweet
and
sympathetic
air
of
propriety
about
with
him
like
a
perfume
that
exhaled
a
most
comfortable
odour
of
religion
his
salves
were
delectable
to
a
degree
his
unguents
and
cosmetics
remarkable
productions
dames
took
his
potions
in
lieu
of
malmsey
his
powders
in
place
of
sweetmeats
never
did
a
more
pleasant
a
more
tactful
old
hypocrite
pander
to
the
failings
of
an
unregenerate
world
aurelius
stood
in
his
laboratory
one
june
morning
balancing
a
in
his
chubby
pink
palm
he
seemed
tickled
by
some
subtlety
of
thought
and
wonderfully
well
pleased
with
his
own
he
smiled
locked
the
in
a
drawer
that
stood
in
a
confidential
cupboard
and
taking
his
cap
and
repaired
to
the
street
pacing
the
narrow
pavement
like
a
veritable
potentate
pretentious
as
any
peacock
yet
mightily
amiable
from
the
superb
that
roared
in
him
like
a
furnace
he
acknowledged
the
greetings
of
with
the
elevation
of
a
hand
a
solemn
movement
of
the
head
it
was
well
to
seem
unutterably
serious
when
under
the
eyes
of
the
mob
only
educated
folk
can
properly
understand
levity
in
a
sage
in
the
erminois
a
stately
highway
that
ran
northwards
from
the
cathedral
he
halted
before
a
mansion
whose
windows
were
rich
with
scutcheons
and
proud
blazonry
aurelius
prospered
with
the
rich
the
atmosphere
of
the
mean
quarters
was
like
a
miasma
to
him
he
loved
sunlight
and
high
places
where
he
might
bask
like
a
lizard
he
passed
by
a
great
gateway
into
the
inner
court
and
was
admitted
into
the
house
with
that
ready
deference
that
speaks
of
familiarity
and
respect
aurelius
climbed
the
broad
stairway
and
sailed
like
a
stately
carrack
into
my
lady
s
chamber
a
dame
in
blue
and
silver
greeted
him
from
an
oriel
the
compounder
of
cosmetics
bowed
disposed
his
staff
and
velvet
cap
upon
a
table
and
appropriated
the
chair
the
lady
had
assigned
to
him
superb
weather
madame
too
sultry
though
i
am
a
person
true
madame
true
gilderoy
would
be
fresher
if
there
were
no
mean
folk
to
stifle
up
the
streets
like
weeds
the
alleys
send
up
such
an
unpleasant
stench
upon
the
breeze
that
it
makes
the
cultured
sense
revolt
from
poverty
the
lady
duessa
s
lips
curled
approvingly
poverty
poverty
my
dear
aurelius
is
like
a
carcase
fit
only
for
quicklime
if
i
had
the
rule
of
the
place
i
would
make
poverty
a
crime
and
cram
all
our
human
sweepings
into
lazar
quarters
the
man
of
physic
nodded
for
sympathy
exactly
so
madame
but
one
would
have
to
deal
with
the
inevitable
religious
instinct
that
would
be
simple
enough
she
simpered
i
should
confine
religion
to
shadows
and
twinkling
tapers
lights
streaming
in
through
enamelled
casements
upon
solemn
colours
bowing
before
dreamy
music
pardons
and
absolutions
bought
with
a
purse
of
gold
it
is
sad
aurelius
but
who
doubts
but
that
religion
makes
scavengers
of
us
all
away
with
your
smug
widows
your
frouzy
burgher
saints
your
i
would
rather
have
picturesque
sin
than
vulgar
piety
the
man
of
herbs
sighed
like
an
organ
pipe
everything
can
be
pardoned
before
coarseness
he
said
give
me
a
dirty
heart
before
a
dirty
face
provided
the
sinner
be
pretty
i
trust
that
madame
was
satisfied
with
my
endeavours
that
the
perfumes
were
such
as
she
desired
the
oil
of
arabia
pleasant
and
fragrant
magical
my
Ã¦sculap
the
oil
makes
the
skin
like
velvet
and
the
drugs
are
paradisic
and
full
of
languors
ah
woman
set
the
tray
beside
master
aurelius
chair
the
man
s
eyes
glistened
over
the
salver
and
the
cup
he
bowed
to
his
hostess
sniffed
and
pursed
his
lips
over
the
wine
madame
knows
how
to
warm
the
heart
truth
to
you
who
have
you
been
renovating
of
late
what
carcase
have
you
been
painting
you
useful
rogue
madame
my
profession
is
discreet
i
see
your
work
everywhere
there
is
the
little
thing
who
is
to
marry
john
of
brissac
well
she
needed
art
severely
now
the
lady
has
a
complexion
like
the
old
man
s
eyes
twinkled
madame
is
pleased
to
jest
he
said
and
to
think
her
fancies
realities
were
all
ladies
as
fresh
as
madame
duessa
what
think
you
would
become
of
my
delectable
art
my
science
of
beauty
i
should
be
a
poor
bankrupt
old
man
ruined
by
too
much
comeliness
aurelius
always
had
the
wit
to
say
the
pleasantest
thing
possible
and
to
press
the
uttermost
drop
of
honey
from
the
comb
of
flattery
a
surly
tongue
will
break
a
man
a
glib
intelligence
ensure
him
a
fortune
aurelius
earned
many
a
fee
by
a
pretty
speech
or
a
tactful
suggestion
then
of
course
he
was
never
hindered
by
sincerity
holy
dominic
laughed
the
lady
i
have
proved
a
good
patron
to
you
in
many
ways
and
i
trust
i
shall
always
deserve
madame
s
trust
a
discreet
tongue
and
a
comfortable
obedience
are
sweet
things
to
a
woman
aurelius
madame
s
voice
recalls
delphi
ah
the
greeks
were
poets
they
knew
how
to
fit
their
religion
to
their
pleasures
tis
only
we
poor
fools
who
measure
sin
by
a
priest
s
pardon
give
me
a
torch
before
an
aspergill
the
man
of
physic
sipped
his
wine
cogitating
over
it
with
jovian
wisdom
the
chief
aim
in
life
madame
he
said
should
be
the
perfecting
of
one
s
own
comfort
tis
my
contention
that
a
fat
bishop
is
a
finer
christian
than
a
lean
friar
the
truism
is
obvious
is
not
my
soul
the
more
mellifluous
and
benign
if
its
shell
is
gilded
and
its
vest
of
velvet
duessa
chuckled
and
flipped
her
chin
give
me
a
warm
bed
she
laughed
and
i
will
pity
creation
the
world
s
saints
are
plump
and
comely
the
true
goddess
has
a
supple
knee
am
i
the
worse
for
being
buxom
madame
said
the
sage
with
great
unction
only
beggars
denounce
gold
and
heaven
is
the
dream
of
diseased
souls
the
cult
of
pleasure
is
the
seal
of
health
discontent
is
the
seed
of
religion
the
door
opened
a
few
inches
and
there
was
the
sound
of
voices
in
muffled
debate
in
the
gallery
the
lady
duessa
listened
rose
from
her
chair
appeared
restless
the
man
of
physic
comprehended
the
situation
and
with
that
tact
that
characterised
him
declared
that
he
had
patronage
elsewhere
to
assuage
the
lady
did
not
detain
him
but
dismissed
him
with
a
smile
a
smile
that
on
such
a
face
as
hers
often
took
the
place
of
words
so
master
aurelius
took
his
departure
five
minutes
later
sforza

occupied
the
vacant
chair
in
the
oriel
there
are
many
ways
to
fame
by
the
broad
embattled
gate
where
the
cerberus
of
war
crouches
by
the
glistening
stair
of
glass
where
all
the
beauty
of
the
world
gleams
as
in
a
thousand
mirrors
by
the
cloaca
of
diplomacy
and
cunning
that
tunnels
under

and
honour
sforza
of
gilderoy
was
a
man
who
never
took
his
finger
off
a
guinea
till
he
had
seen
ten
dropped
into
the
other
palm
he
was
a
rat
ever
nibbling
ever
poking
his
keen
snout
into
prospective
prosperity
he
had
no
real
reverence
for
anything
under
the
sun
to
speak
metaphorically
he
would
as
soon
steal
the
sacrificial
wafer
from
the
altar
as
the
cheese
from
a
burgher
s
larder
when
he
lived
in
earnest
he
lived
in
moral
nebulosity
that
is
to
say
he
had
no
light
save
his
own
lantern
publicly
he
appeared
a
sleek
dignified
person
quick
with
his
figures
apt
at
oratory
a
man
who
could
quote
scripture
by
the
ell
and
swear
by
every
saint
in
the
calendar
sforza
gonfaloniere
of
gilderoy
sat
and
faced
dame
duessa
over
a
little
table
that
held
wine
and
a
bowl
of
roses
his
large
hands
rested
on
the
carved
arms
of
the
chair
he
had
a
debonair
smirk
on
his
face
a
mask
of
complacency
that
suffered
him
to
be
vigilant
in
a
polite
and
courteous
fashion
madame
has
considered
my
proposition
the
woman
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
worked
her
full
lower
lip
against
her
teeth
i
recognise
your
infallibility
gonfaloniere
only
to
the
level
of
human
foresight
madame
you
have
a
longer
nose
than
most
men
i
take
the
insinuation
as
a
compliment
he
contemplated
her
awhile
in
silence
how
am
i
to
know
that
you
are
sincere
he
said
need
you
disbelieve
me
it
is
my
custom
to
disbelieve
in
everybody
till
they
have
satisfied
you
exactly
duessa
looked
out
of
the
window
and
played
with
her
chatelaine
you
know
women
i
would
never
lay
claim
to
such
an
arrogance
of
cunning
nevertheless
you
are
no
fool
i
am
no
fool
and
you
imagine
my
protestations
are
not
sincere
even
after
what
i
have
suffered
he
smiled
at
her
most
cunningly
you
want
proof
i
do
not
like
unsigned
documents
she
started
forward
in
her
chair
with
a
strangely
strenuous
look
on
her
face
fanatic
fools
have
often
made
some
show
of
fortitude
she
said
by
thrusting
a
hand
into
the
fire
or
the
like
see
now
if
i
am
a
liar
or
a
coward
before
he
could
stay
her
she
drew
a
small
stiletto
from
her
belt
spread
her
left
hand
on
the
table
and
then
smote
the
steel
through
the
thick
of
the
palm
and
held
it
there
without
flinching
as
the
blood
flowed
my
signature
she
said
with
her
cheeks
a
shade
paler
madame
you
have
spirit
do
you
believe
in
me
i
may
say
so
you
will
include
me
in
your
schemes
i
will
you
remember
our
mutual
bargain
i
remember
it
she
withdrew
the
stiletto
and
wrapped
her
bleeding
hand
in
her
robe
you
will
initiate
me
at
once

you
shall
go
with
me

xxiii
castle
gambrevault
stood
out
on
a
great
cliff
above
the
sea
like
a
huge
white
crown
on
the
country
s
brow
it
was
as
fine
a
mass
of
masonry
as
the
south
could
show
perched
on
its
great
outjutting
of
the
land
precipiced
on
every
side
save
on
the
north
hoary
sullen
stupendously
strong
it
sentinelled
the

that
rolled
its
blue
to
the
black

of
the

landwards
green
downs
swept
with
long
undulations
to
the
valleys
and
the

that
junetide

rang
with
the
clangour
of

the

had
spurred
north

to
manor
and

there
had
been
a
great
burnishing
of

a

trickled
over
the
downs
towards
the
tall

with

and

ridden
in
to
keep

the
lord
flavian
had
swept
the
country
for
a
hundred
miles
for
mercenary
troops
and
his

poured
gold
he
had
pitched
a
camp
in
the
gambrevault
meadows
some
fifteen

and
two

were
gathered
under
his
banner
from
the

cattle
were
herded
in
and
heavy

laden
with

creaked
up
to
the

there
was
much
victualling
much
blaring
of
trumpets
much
blowing
of
pennons
much
martial
stir
in
the
meadows
it
seemed
as
though
the
lord
flavian
had
a
strenuous
campaign
in
view
and
there
was
much
conjecture
on
the
wind
the
strange
part
of
it
was
that
none
save
sir
modred
had
any
knowledge
for
what
or
against
whom
they
were
to
fight
it
might
be

the
current
conviction
for
the
rest

were
loyal
and
left
the
managing
of
the
business
to
their
lord
the

and
yet
there
was
no

bring
in
a

five

from

the
lord
flavian
himself
with
a

of
twenty

was
lodged
for

in
gilderoy
in
the
great
benedictine

where
his

held

he
was
negotiating
for

fifty
bassinets
two
hundred
gisarmes
a
hundred
ranseurs
fifty
glaives
and
a
number
of

he
had
found
the
armourer
s

peculiarly
insolent
and
disinclined
to
serve
him
he
had
little
suspicion
that
gilderoy
was
seething
under
the
surface

so
much
lava
thus
while

he
would
gain
ten
thousand

from

seven

would
give

xxiv
in
an
antechamber
in
the
palace
of
sforza
of
gilderoy
stood
the
lady
duessa
watching
the
day
die
in
the
west
over
a
black
chaos
of
spires
and
gables
before
her
under
the
casement
lay
the
palace
garden
a
pool
of
perfume
banked
with
tall
cypresses
red
with
the
fire
of
a
myriad
roses
as
night
to
the
sunset
so
seemed
this
antechamber
to
the
garden
panelled
with
black
oak
a
dark
square
of
gloom
to
the
west
the
place
had
a
sullen
look
as
though
its
walls
had
developed
through
the
years
a
sour
and
silence
the
lady
duessa
was
not
a
woman
who
could
trail
tamely
in
anterooms
a
restless
temper
chafed
her
pride
that
evening
and
kept
her
footing
the
polished
floor
like
a
nun
treading
a
cloister
the
casements
were
open
to
the
garden
and
the
multitudinous
sounds
of
the
city
flooded
in
the
thunder
of
the
tumbrils
in
the
narrow
streets
the
distant
blare
of
trumpets
from
the
castle
the
clangour
of
the
cathedral
bells
a
solitary
figure
companioned
the
lady
duessa
in
the
anteroom
cloaked
and
masked
as
was
the
dame
herself
it
was
balthasar
the
dominican
who
followed
her
now
in
secular
habit
having
forsworn
his
black
mantle
and
taken
refuge
in
her
service
from
time
to
time
the
two
spoke
together
in
whispering
undertones
more
than
once
their
lips
touched
the
lady
duessa
turned
and
stood
by
a
casement
with
her
large
white
hands
on
the
sill
she
appeared
to
grow
more
restive
as
the
minutes
passed
as
though
the
antique
clock
on
the
mantle
clicked
its
tongue
at
her
each
gibing
second
this
is
insolence
she
said

bowed
over

for
the

was

of
that
he
led
them
by
a
little
closet
into
the
of
the
palace
a
rich
chamber
lit
by
many
tapers
its
doorway
held
by
a
guard
of
armed
men

in
the
antique
gleamed
in
the
alcoves
the
panelling

with

and
carved
cabinets
stood
against
the
walls
the
ceiling
was
of
purple
with
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
in
gold
thereon
in
the
centre
of
the
room
before
a
slightly
raised
dais
stood
a
round
table
inlaid
with
stones
scrolls
quills
and
inkhorns
covered
it
some
twoscore
men
were
gathered
round
the
table
staring
with
masked
faces
at
a
map
spread
before
them
a
map
showing
all
the
provinces
of
the
south
with
towns
and
castles
marked
in
vermilion
ink
thereon
a
big
man
in
a
red
cloak
stood
conning
the
parchment
pointing
out
with
a
long
forefinger
certain
marches
to
the
masked
folk
about
him
sforza
pointed
duessa
and
balthasar
to
a
carved
bench
by
the
wall
have
the
patience
to
listen
for
an
hour
he
said
turning
to
join
the
men
about
the
table
a
silver
bell
tinkled
and
a
priest
came
forward
to
patter
a
few
prayers
in
latin
at
the
end
thereof
the
masked
samson
in
the
red
cloak
stood
forward
on
the
dais
with
uplifted
fist
instant
silence
held
throughout
the
room
the
man
in
red
began
to
speak
in
deep
tones
that
seemed
to
vibrate
from
his
sonorous
chest
his
theme
was
the
revolt
his
arguments
the
grim
bleak
facts
that
bulked
large
in
the
brain
of
a
leader
of
men
he
dealt
with
realism
with
iron
detail
and
the
strong
suggestions
of
success
revolt
in
the
flesh
bubbled
like
lava
at
a
crater
s
brim
seething
to
overflow
and
scorch
the
land
it
was
plain
that
the
speaker
had
great
schemes
and
a
will
of
adamant
his
ardour
ran
down
like
a
cataract
smiting
into
foam
the
duller
courage
of
the
multitude
when
he
had
ended
his
heroic
challenge
to
the
world
he
took
by
the
hand
a
girl
who
stood
unmasked
at
his
side
she
was
clad
all
in
white
with
a
cross
of
gold
over
her
bosom
and
her
face
shone
nigh
as
pallid
as
her
mantle
the
men
around
the
table
craned
forward
to
get
the
better
view
of
her
nor
was
it
her
temporal
beauty
alone
that
set
the
fanatical
chins
straining
towards
her
figure
there
was
a
radiance
as
of
other
worlds
upon
her
forehead
a
glamour
of
sanctity
as
though
some
sacred
lamp
shed
a
divine
lustre
through
all
her
flesh
at
the
moment
that
the
man
in
the
red
mask
had
drawn
the
girl
forward
beside
him
on
the
dais
balthasar
with
a
stifled
cry
had
plucked
the
lady
duessa
by
the
sleeve
she
had
started
and
stared
in
the
friar
s
face
as
he
spoke
to
her
in
a
whisper
a
scintillant
malice
gathering
in
her
eyes
balthasar
held
her
close
to
him
by
the
wrist
they
were
observed
of
none
save
by
fulviac
whose
care
it
was
to
watch
all
men
as
balthasar
muttered
to
her
duessa
s
frame
seemed
to
straighten
to
dilate
to
stiffen
she
did
not
glance
at
the
friar
but
sat
staring
at
the
girl
in
white
upon
the
dais
the
madonna
of
the
chapel
of
avalon
had
risen
before
her
as
by
magic
her
dispossessor
stood
before
her
in
the
flesh
balthasar
s
tongue
bore
witness
to
the
truth
in
the
packed
passion
of
a
moment
duessa
remembered
her
shame
her
dishonour
her
hunger
for
revenge
the
girl
upon
the
dais
had
been
speaking
to
the
men
assembled
round
her
with
the
simple
calm
of
one
whose
soul
is
assured
of
faith
for
all
her
fierce
distraction
each
word
had
fallen
into
duessa
s
brain
like
pebbles
into
a
well
a
mocking
riotous
scorn
chuckled
and
leapt
in
her
like
the
laughter
of
some
lewd
faun
she
heard
not
the
zealous
mutterings
that
eddied
through
the
room
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
man
in
the
red
cloak
as
he
bent
to
kiss
the
girl
s
slim
hand
she
saw
fulviac
turn
and
point
to
a
roll
of
parchment
on
the
table
we
swim
sirs
or
sink
together
were
his
words
there
can
be
no
traitors

the
cause

three
days

our
banner
in

days
gilderoy

rise

in
the
name
of

and
of
our
lady
the
leaders
of
gilderoy
crowded
about
the
table
where
prosper
the
preacher
waited
with
quill
and
testament
sforza
standing
with
drawn
sword
beside
him
fulviac
had
headed
those
who
took
the
oath
and
had
drawn
back
from
the
press
on
to
the
dais
meanwhile
duessa
with
balthasar
muttering
discretions
in
her
ear
had
skirted
the
black
knot
of
conspirators
and
come
close
upon
fulviac
while
sforza
and
the
rest
were
intent
upon
the
scroll
she
plucked
the
man
in
red
by
the
sleeve
and
spoke
to
him
in
an
undertone
a
word
with
you
in
an
alcove
fulviac
stared
but
drew
aside
from
the
group
none
the
less
and
followed
her
she
had
moved
to
an
oriel
and
sat
down
on
the
cushioned
seat
her
black
robe
sweeping
the
crimson
cloth
fulviac
stood
and
faced
her
thus
closing
her
escape
from
the
oriel
midway
between
them
and
the
table
balthasar
stood
biting
his
nails
in
sullen
vexation
ignorant
of
where
the
woman
s
headstrong
passions
might
be
bearing
them
duessa
soon
had
fulviac
at
the
tongue
s
point
you
are
the
first
man
in
this
assemblage
she
had
asked
him
madame
that
is
so
i
have
a
truth
to
make
known
unmask
to
me
she
hesitated
then
obeyed
him
possibly
i
am
known
to
you
she
said
fulviac
stood
back
a
step
and
looked
at
her
as
a
man
might
look
at
an
old
love
a
knot
of
wrinkles
showed
on
his
forehead
duessa
of
the
black
hair
ah
in
the
old
days
what
would
you
now
madame
let
me
see
your
face
no
you
hold
me
at
a
disadvantage
that
is
well
tell
me
this
tale
of
yours
his
voice
was
cold
as
a
frost
and
there
was
an
inclement
look
about
him
that
should
have
warned
the
woman
had
she
been
less
blinded
by
her
own
malice
she
had
lost
her
cunning
in
her
fuming
passion
and
denounced
when
she
should
have
suggested
blurted
the
whole
when
a
hint
would
have
sufficed
her
i
was
the
lord
flavian
of
gambrevault
s
wife
she
said
that
man
that
devil
fulviac
drew
a
deep
breath
well
he
said
the
fellow
has
divorced
me
i
will
tell
you
why
you
are
the
man
they
call
fulviac
it
was
you
who
took
the
lord
flavian
in
an
ambuscade
to
kill
him
for
the
sake
of
yeoland
of
cambremont
who
stands
yonder
the
whole
tale
is
mine
it
was
that
girl
who
let
the
lord
flavian
escape
out
of
your
hands
a
fine
fool
she
is
making
of
you
my
friend
a
saint
forsooth
flavian
of
avalon
might
sing
you
a
strange
song
duessa
took
breath
she
had
prophesied
passion
a
volcanic
outburst
fulviac
leant
against
the
wainscotting
with
folded
arms
his
masked
face
impenetrable
and
calm
as
stone
he
stirred
never
a
muscle
duessa
had
ventured
forth
into
the
deeps
the
man
thrust
a
question
at
her
suddenly
you
can
prove
the
truth
of
this
duessa
pointed
him
to
fra
balthasar
the
priest
can
bear
out
my
tale
i
will
beckon
him
wait
ah
does
sforza
know
of
this
none
know
it
save
i
and
yonder
priest
then
i
uncover
to
you
he
jerked
his
mask
away
and
stood
half
stooping
towards
her
with
a
peculiar
lustre
in
his
eyes
duessa
stared
at
him
as
at
one
risen
from
the
dead
her
face
blanched
and
stiffened
into
a
bleak
gaping
terror
and
she
could
not
speak
your
tale
dies
with
you
he
smote
her
suddenly
in
the
bosom
with
his
poniard
smote
her
so
heavily
that
the
blow
dragged
her
to
her
knees
she
screamed
like
a
trapped
hare
pressed
her
hands
over
her
bosom
blood
oozing
over
them
a
last
malevolence
leapt
into
her
eyes
she
panted
and
strove
to
speak
listen
sirs
hear
me
fulviac
standing
over
her
like
a
titan
smote
her
again
to
silence
and
for
ever
with
arms
thrust
upwards
she
fell
forward
along
the
floor
her
white
face
hidden
by
her
hood
a
red
ringlet
curled
away
over
the
polished
oak
fulviac
had
sprung
away
with
jaw
clenched
his
face
as
stone
he
drew
his
sword
plucked
balthasar
by
the
throat
hurled
him
back
against
the
wainscotting
a
spy
poniard
him
the
great
room
rushed
into
uproar
the
guards
came
running
from
the
door
fulviac
had
passed
his
sword
through
balthasar
s
body
the
friar
rolled
upon
the
floor
yelping
and
clutching
at
the
swords
that
stabbed
him
it
was
soon
over
not
a
moan
not
a
whimper
sforza
white
as
a
corpse
gripped
fulviac
by
the
shoulder
know
you
whom
you
have
killed
well
enough
gonfaloniere
what
means
it
that
i
am
a
brave
man
sforza
quailed
from
him
and
ran
to
the
oriel
where
several
men
had
lifted
the
woman
in
their
arms
her
lustrous
hair
fell
down
from
under
her
hood
her
hands
stained
with
her
own
blood
trailed
limply
on
the
floor
she
was
a
pathetic
figure
with
her
pale
fair
face
and
drooping
lids
the
men
murmured
as
they
held
her
like
some
poor
bird
still
warm
and
plastic
with
the
life
but
half
flown
from
her
body
fulviac
stood
and
looked
down
into
her
face
his
sword
still
smoked
with
balthasar
s
blood
sirs
he
said
and
his
strong
voice
shook
hear
me
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
once
i
loved
that
woman
but
she
was
evil
evil
to
the
core
she
came
bringing
discord
and
treachery
amongst
us
i
have
done
murder
before
god
for
the
sake
of
the
cause
cover
her
face
it
was
ever
too
fair
to
look
upon
heaven
rest
her
soul
xxv
two
days
had
passed
since
the
secret
assembly
in
the
house
of
sforza
gonfaloniere
of
gilderoy
they
had
buried
duessa
and
balthasar
by
night
in
the
rose
garden
by
the
light
of
a
single
lantern
with
the
fallen
petals
for
a
pall
it
was
the
evening
before
the
day
when
the
land
should
rise
in
arms
to
overthrow
feudal
injustice
and
oppression
on
the
morrow
the
great
cliff
would
be
desolate
its
garrison
marching
through
the
black
pine
woods
on
avalon
and
geraint
towards
eve
when
the
sky
was
clear
as
a
single
sapphire
fulviac
came
from
his
parlour
seeking
yeoland
to
find
her
little
chamber
empty
a
strange
smile
played
upon
his
face
as
he
looked
round
the
room
with
crucifix
embroidery
frame
and
with
rosary
hung
thereon
he
picked
up
her
lute
thrummed
the
strings
and
broke
broodingly
into
the
sway
of
some
southern
song
ah
woman
of
love
with
the
stars
in
the
night
i
see
thee
above
in
a
circlet
of
light
on
the
west
s
scarlet
scutcheon
i
mark
thy
device
and
the
shade
of
the
forest
makes
gloom
of
thine
eyes
god
s
twilight
to
me
he
ended
the
stanza
kissed
the
riband
and
set
the
lute
down
with
a
certain
quaint
reverence
the
postern
stood
open
and
admonished
him
he
passed
out
down
the
cliff
stairway
to
the
forest
an
indescribable
peace
pervaded
the
woods
a
supreme
silence
such
as
the
shepherd
on
the
hills
knows
when
the
stars
beckon
to
his
soul
fulviac
walked
slowly
and
thought
the
more
he
felt
the
altitude
of
the
forest
stillness
as
of
miles
of
luminous
windless
Ã¦ther
he
felt
the
anguishing
pathos
of
a
woman
s
face
he
felt
the
strangeness
of
the
new
philosophy
that
appealed
to
his
heart
nothing
is
more
fascinating
than
watching
a
spiritual
upheaval
in
one
s
own
soul
watching
some
great
power
breaking
up
the
crust
of
custom
and
habit
pondering
the
while
on
the
eternal
mysteries
that
baffle
reason
he
found
yeoland
amid
the
pines
she
had
been
to
the
forest
grave
and
was
returning
towards
the
cliff
when
the
man
met
her
she
seemed
whiter
than
was
her
wont
her
dark
eyes
looking
solemn
and
shadowy
under
their
sweeping
lashes
she
seemed
marvellously
fair
marvellously
pure
and
fragile
as
she
came
towards
him
under
the
trees
something
in
fulviac
s
look
startled
her
women
are
like
the
sea
to
the
cloudy
moods
of
men
in
that
they
catch
every
and
shadow
an
indefinite
something
in
the
man
s
manner
made
her
restless
and
apprehensive
she
went
near
to
him
with
questioning
eyes
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
you
have
had
bad
news
nothing
something
has
troubled
you
perhaps
she
looked
at
him
pensively
a
suspicion
of
reproach
pity
and
understanding
in
her
eyes
is
it
remorse
your
conscience
my
conscience
have
i
had
one
you
have
a
strong
conscience
then
you
have
unearthed
it
madame
a
vein
of
infinite
bitterness
and
melancholy
seemed
to
glimmer
in
his
mood
it
was
a
moment
of
the
girl
still
looked
up
into
his
face
why
did
you
kill
that
woman
why
her
dead
face
haunts
me
i
see
it
everywhere
there
is
some
strange
shadow
over
my
soul
o
that
i
could
get
her
last
cry
from
my
ears
fulviac
with
a
sudden
burst
of
cynicism
broke
into
grim
laughter
a
sound
like
the
rattling
of
dry
bones
in
a
closet
the
girl
shrank
away
with
her
lips
twitching
why
can
not
you
trust
me
with
the
truth
truth
is
not
always
beneficent
it
was
a
matter
of
policy
of
diplomacy
why
discords
are
bad
at
the
eleventh
hour
that
woman
could
have
our
cause
it
was
policy
to
silence
her
and
the
man
i
made
sure
of
it
by
killing
them
yeoland
s
face
had
a
shadow
of
repugnance
upon
it
her
eyes
darkened
the
man
seemed
in
a
callous
scoffing
humour
it
was
mere
glittering
steel
over
the
bitterness
within
you
will
tell
me
her
name
what
is
it
to
you
she
haunts
me
forget
her
i
can
not
have
the
truth
if
you
will
she
was
the
wife
of
the
lord
flavian
of
gambrevault
the
girl
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
then
swayed
away
several
steps
from
fulviac
under
the
trees
one
hand
was
at
her
throat
her
voice
came
in
a
whisper
what
did
she
tell
you
many
things
quick
do
they
touch
me
fulviac
choked
an
oath
and
played
with
his
sword
then
there
was
some
truth
in
her
he
said
the
girl
grew
imperious
i
command
you
to
tell
me
all
madame
the
woman
declared
you
were
a
traitress
and
that
this
lordling
this
flavian
of
gambrevault
loved
you
and
you
killed
her
for
your
sake
and
the
cause
she
might
have
cast
our
saint
out
of
heaven
yeoland
went
back
from
him
and
leant
against
a
tree
with
her
hands
over
her
eyes
sunlight
splashed
down
upon
her
dress
she
shivered
as
in
a
cold
wind
and
could
not
speak
fulviac
s
voice
level
and
passionless
questioned
her
as
she
stood
and
hid
her
face
you
let
the
lord
flavian
escape
i
did
have
you
seen
him
since
i
have
thanks
for
the
truth
her
responses
had
come
like
chords
smitten
from
the
strings
of
a
lute
she
started
away
from
the
tree
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
wringing
her
hands
her
face
was
like
the
face
of
one
in
torture
and
she
seemed
to
struggle
for
breath
fulviac
i
could
not
kill
the
man
the
words
came
like
a
wail
he
was
young
and
he
besought
me
when
your
men
were
breaking
down
the
gate
what
could
i
do
what
could
i
do
he
was
young
and
i
let
him
go
by
the
postern
and
told
you
a
lie
god
help
me
i
told
you
a
lie
the
man
watched
her
with
arms
folded
there
was
a
look
of
deep
melancholy
upon
his
face
as
of
one
wounded
by
the
truth
his
voice
was
sad
but
resolute
and
the
rest
she
rallied
suddenly
and
came
to
him
with
truth
in
her
eyes
they
were
wonderfully
piteous
and
appealing
god
knows
i
have
been
loyal
to
you
the
man
tempted
me
but
i
withstood
him
i
kept
my
loyalty
and
you
told
him
nothing
nothing
he
is
as
innocent
as
a
child
fulviac
looked
down
at
her
with
a
great
light
in
his
eyes
he
spoke
slowly
and
with
a
deeper
intonation
in
his
voice
i
have
dealt
with
many
bad
women
he
said
but
i
believe
you
are
speaking
the
truth
it
is
the
truth
i
take
it
as
such
you
have
been
too
much
a
woman
ah
if
you
could
only
forgive
he
stepped
forward
suddenly
took
her
hands
and
looked
down
at
her
with
a
vast
tenderness
little
woman
if
i
told
you
i
loved
you
would
you
still
swear
that
you
have
spoken
the
truth
god
judge
me
fulviac
i
have
been
loyal
a
strange
light
played
upon
his
face
and
i
ye
heavens
have
i
learnt
my
lesson
in
these
later
days
girl
you
are
above
me
as
the
stars
i
may
but
kiss
your
hands
no
more
you
are
not
for
worldly
ways
or
for
me
battered
veteran
i
have
come
again
by
the
heart
of
a
boy
fear
me
not
little
woman
there
is
no
anger
in
a
great
love
only
deep
grieving
and
unalterable
honour
xxvi
it
was
dawn
mists
covered
the
forest
not
a
wind
stirred
or
sobbed
amid
the
boughs
a
vast
grey
canopy
seemed
to
tent
the
world
a
mysterious
veil
that
tempered
the
sun
and
spread
a
spiritual
gloom
over
rock
and
tree
the
noise
of
horns
played
through
the
misty
aisles
horns
faint
clamorous
like
the
trumpeting
of
forest
elves
there
was
the
dull
rhythmic
onrush
of
many
thousand
feet
the
hurrying
multitudinous
tramp
of
men
marching
armour
gleamed
through
the
glooms
casque
and
bassinet
salade
and
cap
of
steel
flowed
on
and
on
as
phosphorescent
ripples
on
a
subterranean
stream
pike
glaive
gisarme
shone
like
stubble
over
the
forest
slopes
the
sullen
tramp
of
men
the
clashing
clamour
of
arms
the
blaring
of
a
solitary
clarion
such
were
songs
of
the
great
pine
forest
on
that
july
morning
yeoland
rebel
lady
and
saint
on
a
great
white
horse
rode
at
fulviac
s
side
in
full
armour
save
for
her
helmet
her
horse
was
cased
in
steel
chamfron
crinet

croupiere
gleaming
like
burnished
silver
she
made
a
fine
and
martial
figure
enough
a
glittering
dawn

for
a
heroic
cause
about
her
rode
her
guard
the
pick
of
fulviac
s
men
some
fifty
spears
in
all
masses
of
steel
each
bearing
a
scarlet
cross
blazoned
upon
his
white
jupon
nord
of
the
hammer
bore
the
red
banner
worked
by
the
girl
s
own
hands
they
were
hardy
men
and
big
of
bone
sworn
to
keep
and
guard
her
to
the
death
fulviac
and
yeoland
rode
side
by
side
like
brothers
in
arms
all
about
them
were
rolling
spears
and
rocking
helmets
moving
among
the
myriad
trees
the
sound
of
arms
surged
round
them
like
the
ominous
onrush
of
a
sea
war
followed
like
a
on
their
heels
fulviac
was
in
great
spirits
somewhat
solemn
and
philosophic
but
full
of
the
exultation
of
a
man
who
feels
his
ship
surging
on
the
foaming
backs
of
giant
billows
his
eyes
were
proud
enough
when
they
scanned
the
girl
at
his
side
his
heart
thundered
an
echo
to
the
grim
tramp
of
his
men
on
the
march
he
said
making
grandiose
flourishes
with
his
sword
the
future
unrobes
to
us
we
plunge
like
ulysses
into
the
unknown
this
is
life
with
a
vengeance
she
had
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
a
look
in
her
eyes
if
you
love
me
she
said
be
merciful
ah
you
are
always
a
woman
there
are
many
women
such
as
i
am
there
are
many
hearts
that
may
be
wounded
there
are
many
children
he
looked
at
her
meditatively
as
though
her
words
were
both
bitter
and
sweet
in
his
mouth
you
must
play
the
philosopher
little
woman
remember
that
we
work
for
great
ends
i
will
have
mercy
when
mercy
is
expedient
but
we
must
strike
and
strike
terror
we
must
crush
we
must
kill
yet
be
merciful
war

of

it
was
noon
when
the
vanguard
cleared
the
trees
and
spread
rank
on
rank
over
the
edge
of
a
moor
a
zealous
sun
shone
overhead
and
the
world
was
full
of
light
and
colour
the
heather
already
a
blaze
of
purple
the
bracken
still
virgin
the
dense
dark
pines
richly
green
against
the
white
and
azure
of
the

fulviac
yeoland
and
her
guards
rode
out
to
a
hillock
and
took
station
under
the
banner
of
the
cross
the
forest
belched
steel
rank
on
rank
swept
out
with
pikes
glittering
shields
shone
and
colours
juggled
mosaics
haphazard
horse
and
foot
rolled
out
into
the
sun
and
gathered
in
masses
about
the
scarlet
banner
and
the
girl
in
her
silvery
harness
on
the
great
white
horse
the
forest
shadows
were
behind
them
they
had
cast
off
its
cloak
the
world
lay
bare
to
their
faces
they
were
hurling
their
challenge
in
the
face
of
fate
every
man
in
the
mass
might
well
have
felt
the
future
glowing
upon
his
brain
might
well
conceive
himself
a
hero
and
a
patriot
it
was
a
deep
sonorous
shout
that
rolled
up
when
a
thousand
points
of
steel
smote
upwards
to
the
heavens
yeoland
amid
her
guards
had
dim
visions
of
the
power
vested
in
her
slender
sword
where
her
banner
flew
there
brave
men
would
toss
their
pikes
with
a
cheer
for
the
charge
home
where
her
sword
pointed
a
thousand
blades
would
leap
to
do
her
bidding
even
as
she
pondered
these
things
the
trumpets
sounded
and
the
men
of
the
forest
marched
on
fulviac
s
plans
had
been
matured
but
a
week
his
opening
of
the
campaign
was
briefly
as
follows
he
was
bearing
towards
geraint
and
geraint
was
to
rise
that
night
massacre
the
king
s
garrison
and
come
out
to
him
avalon
lay
in
fulviac
s
path
he
was
to
smite
a
blow
at
it
on
his
march
surprise
the
place
if
possible
and
then
hold
on
for
geraint
the
same
night
gilderoy
would
rise
the
castellan
who
was
with
the
townsfolk
would
open
the
gates
of
the
castle
and
deliver
up
all
arms
and
the
siege
train
that
was
kept
there
from
geraint
fulviac
trusted
to
ride
on
with
a
single
troop
to
take
command
at
gilderoy
leaving
nord
prosper
and
the
girl
yeoland
in
command
at
geraint
with
his
numbers
raised
to
some
twenty
thousand
men
he
would
have
his
force
divided
into
two
bodies
ten
thousand
at
gilderoy
ten
thousand
at
geraint
these
two
bodies
would
sweep
up
by
forced
marches
converge
on
gambrevault
crush
the
lord
flavian
s
small
armament
shut
him
up
in
his
castle
assault
or
leaguer
would
do
the
rest
meanwhile
the
peasantry
would
rise
and
flock
in
to
the
standard
of
the
people
free
of
the
forest
fulviac
sent
on
a
troop
of
horse
towards
geraint
to
warn
the
townsfolk
of
his
advance
with
the
main
mass
of
the
foot
he
held
northwards
over
hill
and
dale
and
towards
evening
touched
the
hem
of
the
oak
woods
that
wrapped
the
manor
of
avalon
the
place
was
but
feebly
garrisoned
as
the
lord
flavian
had
withdrawn
most
of
his
men
to
gambrevault
dreaming
little
of
the
that
was
shadowing
the
land
fulviac
had
his
plan
matured
fifty
in
red
and
green
the
gambrevault
colours
were
to
advance
with
a
forged
pennon
upon
the
place
as
though
sent
as
a
reinforcement
from
gambrevault
the
main
body
would
follow
at
a
distance
and
lie
ambushed
in
the
woods
if
the
ruse
answered
and
it
was
an
old
trick
enough
the
barbican
and
gate
could
be
held
till
fulviac
came
up
and
made
matters
sure
thus
avalon
would
fall
on
the
side
of
feudalism
nor
were
fulviac
s
prognostications
at
fault
there
were
not
sixty
men
in
avalon
and
fulviac
s
fifty
gained
footing
in
the
place
and
held
their
ground
till
the
rest
came
up
the
affair
was
over
save
for
some
desultory
slaughter
on
the
turrets
when
fulviac
galloped
forward
over
the
meadows
with
yeoland
and
her
guard
the
man
kept
the
girl
on
the
further
side
of
the
moat
and
did
not
suffer
her
to
stumble
too
suddenly
on
the
realities
of
war
he
feared
wisely
her
woman
s
nature
and
did
not
desire
to
overshock
her
senses
the
butchery
was
over
when
they
neared
the
walls
they
heard
certain
promiscuous
yelpings
and
saw
half
a
dozen
who
had
made
a
last
stand
on
a
tower
tumbled
headlong
over
the
battlements
into
the
moat
below
fulviac
did
not
suffer
the
girl
to
cross
the
bridge
what
passed
within
was
hidden
by
the
impenetrable
massiveness
of
the
sullen
walls
thus
avalon
fair
castle
of
the
woods
and
waters
sent
out
her
wistful
prophecy
to
the
land
in
her
towers
and
galleries
men
lay
dead
bleak
and
stiff
contorted
into
fantastic
attitudes
with
pike
or
sword
sucking
their
vitals
blood
crept
down
the
stairs
dead
men
cumbered
the
beds
and
jammed
the
doors
there
had
been
much
screaming
among
the
women
even
fulviac
s
orders
could
not
cool
the
passions
of
the
mob
it
was
well
indeed
that
he
kept
yeoland
innocent
in
the
meadows
fanaticism
ignorance
lust
were
loose
in
avalon
like
evil
beasts
all
its
fairness
was
defamed
in
one
short
hour
hangings
were
torn
down
furniture
wrecked
and
shattered
chests
and
cupboards
spoiled
of
all
their
store
in
the
chapel
where
refugees
had
fled
to

there
had
been
slaughter
merciless
and
brutal
bertrand
the
old
knight
and
seneschal
lay
dead
on
the
altar
steps
with
a
broken
sword
and
fifty
rents
in
his
carcase
men
were
breaking
the
images
defacing
the
frescoes
strewing
all
the
place
with
blood
and
riot
nord
of
the
hammer
stood
over
the
cellar
door
with
his
great
mace
over
his
shoulder
and
kept
the
men
from
the
wine
elsewhere
the
mob
rooted
like
a
herd
of
swine
in
the
rich
chambers
and
worked
to
the
uttermost
its
swinish
will
when
the
day
was
past
fulviac
and
his
men
as
hounds
that
have
tasted
blood
marched
on
exultantly
towards
geraint
night
and
great
silence
settled
down
over
avalon
the
woods
watched
like
a
host
of
plaintive
mourners
over
the
scene
the
moon
rose
and
shone
on
the
glimmering
mere
and
swooning
lilies
and
streamed
in
through
shattered
casements
on
men
sleeping
in
their
blood
on
ruin
and
the
ghastly
shape
of
death
xxvii
gilderoy
had
risen
it
was
midnight
a
great
bell
boomed
and
clashed
over
the
city
with
a
roar
of
many
voices
floating
on
the
wind
like
the
sullen
thunder
of
a
rising
sea
torches
flashed
and
ebbed
along
the
streets
with
hundreds
of
scampering
shadows
and
a
glinting
of
steel
knots
of
armed
men
hurried
towards
the
great
piazza
where
by
the
city
cross
sforza
the
gonfaloniere
and
his
senators
had
gathered
about
the
red
and
white
gonfalon
of
the
commune
all
the
guild
companies
were
there
with
their
banners
and
fulviac
saint
yeoland
liberty
and
the
commune
such
were
the
watchwords
that
filled
the
mouths
of
the
mob
cressets
had
burst
into
flame
on
the
castle
s
towers
lighting
a
lurid
firmament
while
from
the
steeps
of
the
city
where
stood
the
palaces
of
the
nobles
smoke
and
flame
began
to
rush
ominously
into
the
night
waves
of
hoarse
ululations
seemed
to
sweep
the
city
from
north
south
east
and
west
trumpets
were
clanging
in
the
castle
drums
beating
fifes
braying
through
the
indescribable
chaos
the
great
bell
smote
on
throbbing
through
the
minutes
like
the
heart
of
a
god
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
lord
flavian
was
in
gilderoy
for
the
purchasing
of
arms
at
midnight
you
would
have
found
him
in
his
state
in
the
abbot
s
palace
tugging
at
his
hose
fumbling
at
his
points
and
doublet
buckling
on
his
sword
he
was
hardly
awake
with
the
single
taper
winking
in
the
gloom
the
shrill
ululations
of
the
mob
sounded
through
the
house
with
the
clash
of
swords
and
the
crash
of
hammers
the
lord
flavian
craned
from
the
window
saw
what
he
could
heard
much
and
wondered
if
hell
had
broken
loose
fulviac
and
the
commune
saint
yeoland
down
with
the
lords
down
with
the
priests
the
man
at
the
window
heard
these
cries
and
puzzled
them
out
in
his
peril
certainly
he
was
a
lord
therefore
unpopular
and
yeoland
wherefore
was
that
name
sounding
on
the
tongues
of
and
cooks
was
he
still
dreaming
certes
these
carried
a
certain
blunt
hint
advising
him
that
he
would
have
to
care
for
his
own
skin
malise
his
page
knelt
at
the
door
with
his
ear
to
the
the
boy
was
in
his
shirt
and
breeches
and
trembling
like
an
aspen
flavian
stood
over
him
they
heard
a
rending
sound
as
of
a
gate
giving
a
roar
as
of
water
breaking
through
a
dam
a
yelp
a
scream
or
two
a
confused
medley
of
many
voices
flavian
told
malise
to
open
the
door
and
look
out
into
the
gallery
he
did
so
a
man
more
zealous
than
the
rest
sprang
out
of
the
dark
and
stabbed
at
the
lad
s
throat
he
fell
with
a
whimper
flavian
plunged
his
sword
home
dragged
malise
within
barred
the
door
again
very
tenderly
he
lifted
the
boy
in
his
arms
malise
s
hands
clung
about
his
lord
s
neck
he
moaned
a
little
and
was
very
white
save
yourself
messire
flavian
bore
him
towards
a
door
that
stood
open
in
the
panelling
he
felt
the
lad
s
blood
soaking
through
his
doublet
entreaties
were
poured
into
his
ears
i
die
i
die
oh
the
smart
the
burn
of
it
leave
me
messire
let
me
lie
still
nonsense
it
is
no
use
i
have
it
deep
the
man
s
knife
went
home
flavian
felt
the
lad
s
hands
relax
saw
his
head
droop
on
his
shoulder
he
turned
and
put
him
down
on
the
bed
and
knelt
there
while
malise
panted
and
strove
to
speak
go
messire
flavian
was
trying
to
staunch
the
flow
from
the
boy
s
neck
with
a
corner
of
the
sheeting
his
own
doublet
was
drenched
with
blood
in
a
minute
he
saw
the
futility
of
such
unconscious
heroism
the
flickering
taper
by
the
bed
told
that
malise
s
life
would
ebb
before
its
own
light
would
be
gutted
blows
were
being
dealt
upon
the
door
flavian
kissed
the
lad
took
the
taper
and
passed
out
by
the
panel
in
the
wainscotting
a
stairway
led
him
to
a
little
gate
that
opened
on
the
abbot
s
garden
he
more
than
thought
to
find
the
passage
disputed
but
the
place
stretched
quiet
before
him
as
he
came
out
with
sword
drawn
the
scent
of
the
flowers
and
fragrant
shrubs
was
heavy
on
the
night
air
and
the
shouts
of
the
mob
sounded
over
the
black
roofs
and
rang
in
his
ears
with
an
inspiriting
fury
there
was
a
gate
at
the
far
end
of
the
garden
opening
through
a
stone
wall
into
a
narrow
alley
and
flavian
as
he
scoured
the
paths
could
see
pike
points
bobbing
above
the
wall
and
a
flare
of
torches
men
were
breaking
in
even
here
and
he
was
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
corner
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
he
found
a
big
marrow
bed
and
crawling
under
the
leaves
like
a
worm
he
smeared
dirt
over
his
face
and
clothes
and
awaited
developments
in
another
minute
the
garden
gate
fell
away
and
a
tatterdemalion
rout
poured
in
strenuous
and
frothy
as
any
tavern
pack
they
spread
over
the
garden
towards
the
house
shouting
and
blaspheming
like
a
herd
of
satyrs
flavian
saw
his
chance
plunged
from
his
dark
corner
and
joined
the
mob
of
moving
figures
dirty
face
and
dirtier
clothes
were
in
kindred
keeping
he
shouted
as
lustily
as
any
and
by
dint
of
gradual
and
discreet
circumlocutions
edged
to
the
gate
and
escaped
into
the
alley
running
on
he
skirted
the
abbey
and
came
out
into
the
square
that
flanked
the
abbey
church
and
the
great
gate
a
hundred
torches
seemed
moving
behind
the
abbey
windows
the
square
teemed
and
smoked
with
riot
flavian
went
into
the
crowd
with
drawn
sword
screeching
out
mob
cries
like
any
huckster
smiting
men
on
the
back
laughing
and
swearing
as
in
excellent
humour
his
gusto
saved
him
as
he
passed
through
the
mob
he
saw
heads
gory
and
mangled
dancing
upon
pikes
he
saw
women
drunk
with
beer
and
violence
waving
a
severed
foot
or
hand
kissing
men
hugging
each
other
mouthing
unutterable
obscenities
in
the
mad
delirium
of
the
hour
he
saw
whelps
of
boys
scrambling
and
struggling
for
some
ghastly
relic
scavengers
and
sweeps
dressed
up
in
the
habits
of
the
benedictines
they
had
slain
one
man
carried
in
his
palm
an
eye
that
had
been
torn
from
its
socket
which
he
held
with
a
leer
in
the
faces
of
his
fellows
further
still
he
saw
half
a
dozen
beggars
dragging
the
dead
body
of
a
lady
over
the
stones
by
cords
fastened
to
the
ankles
while
dogs
worried
and
tore
at
the
flesh
he
learnt
afterwards
that
it
was
the
body
of
his
own
cousin
a
young
girl
who
had
been
lately
betrothed
last
of
all
he
saw
a
carcase
dangling
from
a
great
iron
lamp
bracket
in
the
centre
of
the
square
and
understood
from
the
crowd
that
it
was
the
body
of
the
abbot
his
uncle
men
and
women
were
pelting
it
with
offal
and
he
an
aristocrat
of
aristocrats
dirty
and
dishevelled
rubbed
shoulders
with
the
scourings
of
the
gutter
shouted
their
shouts
echoed
their
exultation
at
first
the
grim
humour
of
the
thing
smote
him
in
grosser
farcical
fashion
but
the
mood
was
not
for
long
he
remembered
malise
whimpering
and
quivering
in
his
arms
he
remembered
the
body
dragged
about
the
square
and
worried
by
dogs
he
remembered
the
carcase
swinging
by
the
rope
he
remembered
the
dripping
heads
and
the
fragments
of
flesh
tossed
about
by
the
maddened
and
intoxicated
mob
it
was
then
that
his
eyes
grew
hot
with
shame
and
his
blood
ran
like
lava
through
his
veins
it
was
then
that
the
spirit
of
a
vampire
rushed
into
his
heart
and
that
he
swore
great
solemn
oaths
by
all
the
bones
and
relics
of
the
saints
god
give
him
a
hale
body
out
of
gilderoy
and
this
city
scum
should
be
scourged
with
iron
and
roasted
by
fire
he
got
across
the
square
by
dint
of
his
noisy
hypocrisy
and
turned
morosely
into
a
dark
alley
that
led
towards
the
walls
gentleman
the
mere
thirst
for
existence
had
cooled
out
of
him
and
he
was
in
a
fine
rendering
passion
to
his
a
striding
blasphemous
temper
that
longed
to
take
the
whole
city
by
the
throat
and
beat
a
fist
in
its
bloated
face
he
wondered
what
had
become
of
his
knights
esquires
and
it
was
told
him
in
later
days
how
they
died
fighting
in
the
abbey
refectory
died
with
the
benedictines
at
their
side
and
a
rare
barrier
of
corpses
to
tell
of
the
swing
of
their
swords
flavian
dodged
into
a
dark
porch
to
consider
his
circumstances
and
the
baffling
influence
of
the
same
he
had
caught
enough
from
the
mob
to
comprehend
what
had
occurred
and
what
was
to
follow
certainly
for
many
months
he
had
heard
rumours
but
like
other
demigods
he
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
and
smiled
like
a
saturn
the
largeness
of
the
upheaval
stupefied
him
at
first
now
as
he
pondered
it
it
gave
a
more
heroic
colour
to
his
passions
to
be
free
of
gilderoy
that
was
the
necessity
he
guessed
shrewdly
enough
that
the
gates
would
be
well
guarded
and
the
walls
he
smote
his
thigh
and
remembered
where
the
river
coursed
round
the
rocky
foundations
and
washed
the
walls
a
big
plunge
a
swim
and
he
would
have
liberty
enough
and
to
spare
he
set
off
instanter
down
alleys
and
byways
through
the
most
quarter
of
the
city
the
place
had
a
hundred
stenches
on
a
hot
summer
night
naturally
enough
such
haunts
were
deserted
save
for
a
few
hags
garrulous
at
the
doorways
and
a
few
fragments
of
dirt
called
by
courtesy
children
the
rats
had
gone
marauding
leaving
their
offal
heaps
empty
keen
as
a
fox
he
threaded
on
and
came
before
long
to
the
walls
a
black
mass
rising
above
the
hovels
packed
like
pigsties
to
the
very
ramparts
avoiding
a
tower
he
held
along
a
lane
that
skirted
the
wall
looking
for
one
of
the
many
stairways
leading
to
the
battlements
it
was
here
in
the
light
of
a
tavern
window
that
he
came
plump
upon
two
sweaty
artisans
rendered
somewhat
more
gross
and
insolent
by
the
fumes
of
liquor
the
men
challenged
flavian
with
drunken
arrogance
they
had
their
password
to
the
devil
all
the
accumulated
viciousness
of
an
hour
tingled
in
his
sword
arm
he
fell
upon
the
men
like
a
barak
kicked
one
carcase
into
the
gutter
and
ran
on
he
was
soon
up
a
stairway
and
on
the
walls
finding
them
absolutely
deserted
the
city
stretched
behind
him
a
black
chaos
emitting
a
grim
uproar
its
dark
slopes
chequered
here
and
there
with
angry
flame
before
him
swept
the
river
and
he
heard
it
swirling
amid
the
reeds
further
still
meadows
lay
open
to
the
stars
and
in
the
distance
stood
solemn
woods
and
heights
touched
with
the
silver
of
the
sky
he
moved
on
to
where
a
loop
of
the
river
curled
up
to
wash
the
walls
the
water
was
in
full
flood
at
the
place
and
he
heard
it
gurgling
cheerily
against
the
stones
flavian
took
a
last
look
at
gilderoy
its
castle
red
with
burning
cressets
its
multitudinous
roofs
its
uproar
like
the
noise
of
a
nest
of
hornets
he
shook
his
fist
over
the
city
climbed
the
battlements
jumped
for
it
plunged
like
a
log
came
up
spluttering
to
strike
out
for
the
further
bank
in
the
meadows
the
townsfolk
kept
horses
at
graze
flavian
aglow
to
the
with
water
squelching
from
his
shoes
caught
a
cob
that
was
hobbled
in
a
field
hard
by
the
river
he
unhobbled
the
beast
hung
on
by
the
mane
mounted
and
set
off
for
the
road
to
gambrevault
xxviii
dawn
climbing
red
over
pinewoods
piled
on
the
hills
dawn
optimistic
yet
ominous
harbinger
of
war
and
such
perils
as
set
the
heart
leaping
and
the
blood
afire
dawn
that
cried
unto
the
world
better
one
burst
of
heroism
and
then
the
grave
than
a
miserable
monotony
of
nothingness
a
domestic
surfeiting
of
the
senses
with
a
wife
and
a
fat
larder
out
of
the
east
climbed
the
man
on
the
stolen
horse
riding
out
of
the
dawn
with
the
lurid
phantasms
of
the
night
still
running
riot
in
his
brain
no
sleep
had
smoothed
the
crumpled
page
or
touched
the
memory
with
unguent
to
assuage
the
smart
maledictions
vengeances
prophecies
of
fire
and
sword
rushed
with
the
red
dawn
over
the
hills
with
forty
miles
behind
him
he
came
on
his
jaded
sweaty
beast
towards
his
own
castle
of
gambrevault
forded
his
own
stream
saw
his
mills
gushing
foam
heard
the
thunder
of
the
weir
how
eternally
peaceful
everything
seemed
in
the
dewy
amber
light
of
the
dawn
away
rolled
the
downs
billows
of
glorious
green
into
the
west
gambrevault
s
towers
rose
against
the
blue
he
saw
the
camp
in
the
meadows
his
own
banner
blowing
to
the
breeze
the
meadows
that
morning
were
quiet
as
a
graveyard
as
the
lord
flavian
rode
through
to
the
great
gate
of
gambrevault
soldiers
idling
about
stiffened
up
saluted
stared
in
astonishment
at
the
grim
man
who
rode
by
on
a
foundered
horse
looking
neither
to
the
right
hand
nor
the
left
he
cut
something
of
a
figure
as
though
he
had
been
in
a
tavern
brawl
and
had
spent
the
night
snoring
in
a
yet
there
was
an
indescribable
power
and
dignity
in
the
tatterdemalion
rider
for
all
his
tumbled
look
the
compressed
lips
knotted
brow
smouldering
eyes
spoke
of
phenomenal
emotions
phenomenal
passions
not
a
man
cheered
and
the
silence
was
yet
more
eloquent
than
clamour
he
rode
in
by
the
great
gate
and
parrying
the
blank
glances
and
interrogations
of
his
knights
called
for
two
esquires
and
withdrew
to
his
own
state
rooms
his
first
trouble
was
to
acknowledge
such
necessities
as
hunger
and
cleanliness
he
contrived
to
compass
both
at
once
eating
ravenously
even
while
he
was
in
the
bath
his
next
command
was
for
his
harness
and
his
esquires
armed
him
agog
for
news
even
waxing
inquisitive
to
be
snubbed
for
their
pains
assemble
my
knights
and
gentlemen
in
the
great
hall
ran
his
order
and
after
praying
awhile
in
his
own
private
oratory
he
passed
down
to
join
the
assemblage
solemn
and
as
a
young
jove
there
is
a
certain
vain
satisfaction
in
being
the
possessor
of
some
phenomenal
piece
of
news
wherewith
to
astonish
a
circle
of
friends
the
dramatic
person
blurts
it
out
like
a
stage
duke
the
real
epicure
lets
it
filter
through
his
teeth
in
fragments
watching
with
a
twinkling
satisfaction
its
effect
upon
his
hearers
the
lord
flavian
s
revelations
that
morning
were
deliberate
and
gradual
leisurely
in
the
extreme
many
a
man
waxes
flippant
or
cynical
when
his
feelings
are
deep
and
sincere
and
he
is
disinclined
to
bare
his
heart
to
the
world
flavian
addressed
his
assembled
knights
with
a
certain
stinted
and
pedantic
courtliness
when
they
had
warmed
to
his
level
then
he
could
indulge
his
sympathies
to
the
full
the
atmosphere
about
those
who
wait
to
hear
our
experiences
or
opinions
is
often
like
cold
water
somewhat
repellent
till
the
first
plunge
has
been
tried
gentlemen
he
said
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
the
abbot
porphyry
my
uncle
is
numbered
with
the
saints
so
much
for
the
first
confession
it
elicited
a
sympathetic
murmur
from
those
assembled
a
very
proper
and
respectable
expression
of
feeling
but
nothing
passionate
i
also
have
to
inform
you
with
much
christian
resignation
that
sir
jordan
and
sir
kay
malise
my
page
and
some
twenty
are
in
all
human
probability
dead
this
time
some
glimmer
of
light
pervaded
the
hall
there
was
still
mystification
silence
and
an
exchanging
of
glances
finally
gentlemen
i
may
confess
to
you
that
a
great
insurrection
is
afoot
in
the
land
that
gilderoy
has
declared
against
the
king
and
the
nobility
that
the
scum
of
a
populace
has
made
a
great
massacre
of
the
magnates
that
i
gentlemen
by
the
grace
of
god
have
escaped
to
preach
to
you
of
these
things
a
chorus
of
grim
ejaculations
came
from
the
knights
and
the
captains
assembled
astonishment
and
emotions
more
durable
showed
on
every
face
flavian
gained
heat
and
let
his
tongue
have
liberty
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
of
fervid
oratory
the
men
were
as
wise
as
their
lord
and
every
wit
as
vicious
gilderoy
had
signalised
her
rising
in
blood
mob
rule
had
been
proclaimed
the
peasantry
and
townsfolk
had
thrown
down
the
glove
to
the
nobles
these
were
bleak
plain
facts
that
touched
to
the
quick
the
men
who
stood
gathered
in
the
great
hall
of
gambrevault
not
a
sword
was
in
its
scabbard
when
modred
s
deep
voice
gave
the
cry
god
and
philip
for
the
king
then
like
a
powder
bag
flung
into
a
fire
came
the
news
of
the
storming
and
wrecking
of
avalon
a
single
had
escaped
the
slaughter
escaped
by
crawling
down
an
offal
shoot
and
hiding
till
the
rebels
evacuated
the
place
and
marched
under
cover
of
night
for
geraint
the
man
had
crept
out
and
fled
on
foot
from
the
stricken
place
for
gambrevault
it
was
a
tramp
of
ten
leagues
but
he
had
stuck
to
it
through
the
night
like
a
trojan
and
knowing
the
road
well
had
reached
gambrevault
before
the
sun
was
at
noon
they
brought
him
before
flavian
and
the
rest
fagged
to
the
fifth
toe
and
hardly
able
to
stand
he
told
the
whole
tale
as
much
as
he
knew
of
it
in
a
blunt
yet
dazed
way
his
senses
appeared
numbed
by
the
deeds
that
had
been
done
that
night
flavian
leant
back
in
his
escutcheoned
chair
and
gnawed
at
his
lip
this
last
thrust
had
gone
home
more
keenly
than
the
rest
that
castle
of
lilies
avalon
the
fair
was
but
a
friend
of
wood
and
stone
yet
a
friend
having
wondrous
hold
upon
his
heart
he
had
been
born
there
and
under
the
shadows
of
its
towers
his
mother
had
taken
her
last
sacrament
men
can
love
a
tree
a
cottage
a
stream
flavian
loved
avalon
as
being
the
temple
of
the
unutterable
memories
of
the
past
desolation
and
ruin
bertrand
his
old
master
at
arms
slain
he
sprang
up
like
an
achilles
with
the
ghost
of
patroclus
haunting
his
soul
gentlemen
shall
these
things
pass
hear
me
god
and
the
world
hear
my
oath
sworn
in
this
my
castle
of
gambrevault
may
i
never
rest
till
these
things
are
reprieved
in
blood
till
there
are
too
few
men
to
bury
the
dead
though
my
walls
fall
and
my
towers
totter
though
i
win
ruin
and
a
grave
i
swear
by
the
sacrament
to
do
such
deeds
as
shall
ring
and
resound
in
history
so
they
went
all
of
them
together
and
swore
by
the
body
and
blood
of
the
lord
to
take
such
vengeance
as
the
sword
alone
can
give
to
the
hot
passions
of
mankind
that
noon
there
was
much
stir
and
life
in
gambrevault
the
camp
hummed
like
a
wasp
s
nest
when
violence
threatens
the
men
were
ready
to
run
to
arms
on
the
first
sounding
of
the
trumpet
armourers
and
farriers
were
at
work
flavian
had
sent
out
two
companies
of
light
horse
to
reconnoitre
towards
gilderoy
and
geraint
they
had
orders
not
to
draw
rein
till
they
had
sure
view
of
such
rebel
voices
as
were
on
the
march
to
hang
on
the
horizon
to
watch
and
follow
to
send
gallopers
to
gambrevault
on
no
account
to
give
battle
companies
were
despatched
to
drive
in
the
cattle
from
the
hills
and
to
bring
in
fodder
the
gambrevault
mills
were
emptied
of
flour
and
burnt
to
the
ground
in
view
of
their
being
of
use
to
the
rebels
in
case
of
a
siege
certain
cottages
and
outhouses
under
the
castle
walls
were
demolished
to
leave
no
cover
for
an
attacking
force
the
cats
tribocs
catapults
and
bombards
upon
the
battlements
were
overhauled
and
cleared
for
a
siege
towards
evening
human
wreckage
began
to
drift
in
from
the
country
bearing
lamentable
witness
to
the
thoroughness
of
fulviac
s
incendiarism
gambrevault
might
have
stood
for
heaven
by
the
strange
scattering
of
folk
who
came
to
seek
its
sanctuary
fire
and
sword
were
abroad
with
a
vengeance
cottars
borderers
and
villains
had
risen
in
the
night
treachery
had
drawn
its
poniard
even
the
hound
had
snapped
at
its
master
s
hand
many
pathetic
figures
passed
under
the
great
arch
of
gambrevault
gate
that
day
first
a
knight
came
in
on
horseback
a
baby
in
his
arms
and
a
woman
clinging
behind
him
sole
relics
of
a
home
margaret
the
countess
of
anne
s
was
brought
in
on
a
litter
by
a
few
faithful
her
husband
and
her
two
sons
were
dead
young
prosper
of
fountains
came
in
on
a
pony
the
lad
wept
like
a
girl
when
questioned
and
told
of
a
mother
and
a
sire
butchered
a
home
sacked
and
burnt
there
were
stern
faces
in
gambrevault
that
day
and
looks
more
eloquent
than
words
verily
said
flavian
to
modred
the
strong
we
shall
have
need
of
our
swords
and
god
grant
that
we
use
them
to
good
purpose
so
night
drew
near
and
still
no
riders
had
come
from
the
companies
that
had
ridden
out
to
reconnoitre
towards
gilderoy
and
geraint
flavian
had
had
a
hundred
duties
on
his
hands
exercising
his
courtesy
to
the
refugees
condoling
reassuring
inspecting
the
defences
and
the
siege
train
superintending
the
victualling
of
the
place
he
had
ordered
his
troops
under
arms
in
the
meadows
and
had
spoken
to
them
of
what
had
passed
at
gilderoy
and
what
might
be
looked
for
in
the
future
there
seemed
no
lack
of
loyalty
on
their
part
flavian
had
ever
been
a
magnanimous
and
a
generous
overlord
glad
to
be
merciful
and
no
libertine
at
the
expense
of
his
underlings
his
feudatories
were
bound
to
him
by
ties
more
strong
than
mere
legalities
they
cheered
him
loudly
enough
as
he
rode
along
the
lines
in
full
armour
with
fifty
knights
following
as
his
guard
night
came
outposts
had
been
pushed
forward
to
the
woods
and
a
strong
picket
held
the
ford
across
the
river
on
the
battlements
guards
went
to
and
fro
and
clarions
parcelled
out
the
night
and
rang
the
changes
in
the
east
there
was
a
faint
yellowish
light
in
the
sky
a
distant
glare
as
of
a
fire
many
miles
away
in
the
camp
men
were
ready
to
fly
to
arms
at
the
first
thunder
of
war
over
the
hills
flavian
held
a
council
in
the
great
hall
a
council
attended
by
all
his
knights
and
captains
they
had
a
great
map
spread
upon
the
table
a
chart
of
the
demesnes
of
gambrevault
and
avalon
and
the
surrounding
country
their
conjectures
turned
on
the
possible
intentions
of
the
rebels
whether
they
would
venture
on
a
campaign
in
the
open
or
lie
snug
within
walls
and
indulge
in
raids
and
forays
and
then
as
to
the
loyalty
of
their
own
troops
on
this
point
flavian
was
dogmatic
having
a
generous
and
heart
not
quick
to
credit
others
with
treachery
i
would
take
oath
for
my
own
men
he
said
their
fathers
have
served
my
fathers
i
have
never
played
the
tyrant
there
is
every
reason
to
trust
their
loyalty
an
old
knight
sir
tristram
had
taken
a
goodly
share
in
the
debate
a
veteran
from
the
barons
wars
and
a
man
of
honest
experience
no
mere
pantaloon
his
grey
beard
swept
down
upon
his
cuirass
his
eyes
were
full
of
intelligence
under
his
bushy
brows
the
hands
that
were
laid
upon
the
table
were
clawed
and
deformed
by
gout
gentlemen
he
said
i
have
not
the
fitness
and
youth
of
many
of
you
but
i
can
lay
claim
to
some
wisdom
in
war
to
my
liege
lord
whom
sirs
i
honour
as
a
man
of
soul
i
would
address
two
proverbs
first
despise
not
sire
your
enemies
modred
laughed
in
his
black
beard
reverence
the
scum
of
gilderoy
ha
man
if
we
are
well
advised
these
folk
have
been
breathed
upon
by
fanaticism
i
tell
you
i
have
seen
a
crowd
make
a
very
stubborn
day
of
it
with
some
of
the
best
troops
that
ever
saw
service
secondly
sire
i
would
say
to
you
turn
off
your
mercenaries
if
the
sky
looks
black
never
trust
your
neck
to
paid
men
when
any
great
peril
threatens
flavian
out
of
his
good
sense
agreed
with
tristram
your
words
are
weighty
he
said
so
long
as
we
are
campaigning
i
will
pay
them
well
and
keep
them
if
it
comes
to
a
siege
i
will
have
no
hired
bravos
in
gambrevault
and
now
gentlemen
it
is
late
get
what
sleep
you
may
for
who
knows
what
may
come
with
the
morrow
modred
and
geoffrey
i
leave
to
you
the
visiting
of
the
outposts
order
up
my
lutists
and
i
shall
not
sleep
without
a
song
he
passed
alone
to
the
outer
battlements
and
let
the
night
expand
about
his
soul
the
stars
touch
his
meditations
from
the
minstrels
gallery
in
the
hall
came
the
wail
of
viols
the
voices
of
flute
dulcimer
and
bassoon
keeping
a
mellow
he
heard
the
sea
upon
the
rocks
saw
it
glimmering
dimly
to
end
in
a
fringe
of
foam
so
his
thoughts
soared
to
the
face
of
one
woman
in
the
world
the
golden
eve
peering
out
of
paradise
whose
soul
seemed
to
ebb
and
flow
like
the
moan
of
the
distant
music
he
fell
into
deep
forecastings
of
the
future
he
remembered
her
words
to
him
her
mysterious
warnings
her
inexplicable
inconsistencies
her
appeal
to
war
gilderoy
had
taught
him
much
and
some
measure
of
truth
shone
like
a
dawn
spear
in
the
east
a
gulf
of
war
and
vengeance
stretched
from
his
feet
yet
he
let
his
soul
circle
like
a
golden
moth
about
the
woman
s
beauty
while
the
wail
of
the
viols
stole
out
upon
his
ears
xxix
little
store
of
sleep
had
the
lord
of
gambrevault
that
night
war
with
all
its
echoing
prophecies
played
through
his
thought
as
a
storm
wind
through
the
rotting
casements
of
a
ruin
he
beheld
the
high
hills
red
with
beacons
the
valleys
filled
with
the
surging
steel
of
battle
gilderoy
and
its
terrors
flamed
through
his
brain
above
all
like
the
moon
from
a
cloud
shone
the
face
of
yeoland
the
madonna
of
the
forest
he
was
up
and
armed
before
dawn
and
on
the
topmost
battlements
eager
for
the
day
the
sun
came
with
splendour
out
of
the
east
hurling
a
golden
net
over
the
woods
piled
upon
the
hills
mists
moved
from
off
the
sea
that
shimmered
opalescent
towards
the
dawn
brine
laded
the
breeze
the
waves
were
scalloped
amber
and
purple
fringed
with
foam
about
the
agate
cliffs
the
hours
were
void
to
the
man
till
riders
should
come
in
with
tidings
of
how
the
revolt
sped
at
gilderoy
and
geraint
the
prophetic
hints
that
had
been
tossed
to
him
from
the
tongues
of
the
mob
had
served
to
discover
to
him
his
own
invidious
fame
gambrevault
on
its
rocky
headland
stood
the
strongest
castle
in
the
south
a
black
mass
looming
athwart
the
perilous
path
of
war
the
rebels
would
smite
at
it
of
that
its
lord
was
assured
at
noon
he
attended
mass
in
the
chapel
with
all
his
knights
solacing
his
impatience
with
the
purer
aspirations
of
the
soul
it
was
even
as
he
left
the
chapel
that
sir
modred
met
him
telling
how
a
galloper
had
left
the
woods
and
was
cantering
over
the
meadows
towards
the
headland
the
man
was
soon
under
the
arch
of
the
great
gate
his
sweating
horse
smiting
fire
from
the
stones
dropping
foam
from
his
black
muzzle
the
rider
was
godamar
flavian
s
favourite
esquire
a
ruddy
youth
with
the
heart
of
a
jonathan
modred
brought
him
to
the
where
flavian
awaited
him
in
full
harness
two
trumpeters
at
his
back
sire
geraint
has
risen
ha
they
are
marching
on
gambrevault
your
news
on
with
it
godamar
told
how
the
troop
had
neared
geraint
at
eve
and
camped
in
the
wood
over
night
at
dawn
they
had
reconnoitred
the
town
and
seen
to
their
credit
black
columns
of
foot
pouring
out
by
all
the
gates
the
gambrevault
company
had
fallen
back
upon
the
woods
unseen
and
had
watched
the
gerainters
massing
in
the
city
meadows
about
a
red
banner
and
one
in
armour
upon
a
white
horse
godamar
had
lain
low
in
a
thicket
and
watched
the
rebels
march
by
in
the
valley
they
had
passed
between
two
hundred
paces
of
him
and
he
swore
by
roland
the
paladin
that
it
was
a
woman
who
rode
the
great
white
horse
flavian
had
listened
to
the
man
with
a
golden
flux
of
fancy
that
had
divined
something
of
the
esquire
s
meaning
godamar
he
said
sire
you
rode
with
me
that
day
when
we
tracked
a
certain
lady
from
cambremont
glade
towards
the
pine
forest
sire
you
forestall
me
in
thought
so
i
could
even
swear
upon
my
sword
that
it
is
yeoland
of
cambremont
who
rides
with
the
gerainters
flavian
coloured
and
commended
him
godamar
ran
on
i
threaded
the
thicket
sire
made
a
detour
galloped
hard
and
rejoined
our
company
the
gerainters
were
blind
as
bats
they
had
never
a
scout
to
serve
them
we
kept
under
cover
and
watched
their
march
they
came
due
west
in
three
columns
one
following
the
other
six
miles
from
geraint
longsword
gave
me
a
spare
horse
and
sent
me
spurring
to
bring
you
the
news
flavian
stroked
his
chin
and
brooded
their
numbers
he
asked
anon
ten
thousand
men
sire
we
guessed
it
such
before
godamar
had
ended
his
despatch
a
second
galloper
came
in
breathless
from
gilderoy
he
had
left
fulviac
s
rebels
massing
in
the
meadows
beyond
the
river
and
had
kept
cover
long
enough
to
see
the
foremost
column
wheel
westwards
and
take
the
road
for
gambrevault
the
scout
numbered
the
gilderoy
force
at
anything
between
eight
and
twelve
thousand
pikes
fulviac
had
been
on
the
march
three
hours
the
lord
of
avalon
stood
forward
in
the
oriel
in
the
full
light
of
the
sun
sea
hill
and
woodland
stretched
before
him
under
a
peerless
sky
there
was
the
scent
of
brine
in
the
breeze
the
banner
of
youth
was
ablaze
upon
the
hills
a
red
heart
beat
under
his
shimmering
cuirass
red
blood
flushed
his
brain
it
was
a
season
of
romance
and
of
lusty
daring
an
hour
when
his
manhood
shone
bright
as
his
burnished
sword
thoughts
were
tumbling
moving
over
his
mind
like
water
over
a
wheel
geraint
stood
ten
leagues
from
gambrevault
gilderoy
thirteen
the
geraint
forces
had
been
on
the
march
six
hours
or
more
the
men
of
gilderoy
only
three
hence
by
all
the
craft
of
araby
they
of
geraint
were
three
hours
and
three
leagues
to
the
fore
bad
generalship
without
doubt
but
vastly
prophetic
to
the
man
figuring
in
the
oriel
his
fingers
drumming
on
the
stone
sill
strategy
stirred
in
him
and
waxed
like
a
dragon
created
from
some
magic
crystal
into
the
might
of
deeds
the
lord
of
gambrevault
caught
the
strong
smile
of
chivalry
a
great
venture
burnt
upon
his
sword
it
was
no
uncertain
voice
that
rang
through
the
hall
of
gambrevault
gentlemen
to
horse
trumpets
blow
the
sally
let
every
man
who
can
ride
mount
and
follow
me
blow
trumpets
blow
the
brazen
throats
brayed
from
the
walls
their
shrill
scream
echoing
and
echoing
amid
the
distant
hills
their
message
was
like
the
plunging
of
a
boulder
into
a
pool
smiting
to
foam
and
clamour
the
camp
in
the
meadows
swords
were
girded
on
spears
plucked
from
the
sods
horses
saddled
and
bridled
in
grim
haste
in
one
short
stirring
hour
flavian
rode
out
from
gambrevault
with
twelve
hundred
riders
at
his
back
those
on
the
walls
watched
this
mass
of
fire
and
colour
thundering
over
the
meadows
splashing
through
the
ford
smoking
away
to
the
east
with
trumpets
clanging
banneroles
adance
there
was
to
be
great
work
done
that
day
the
sentinels
on
the
walls
gossiped
together
and
swore
by
their
lord
as
he
had
been
the
king
gambrevault
and
its
towers
sank
back
against
the
skyline
its
banner
waving
heavily
above
the
keep
flavian
s
mass
of
knights
and
held
over
the
eastern
downs
that
rolled
greenly
above
the
black
cliffs
and
the
blue
mosaics
of
the
sea
a
brisk
breeze
laughed
in
their
faces
setting
plumes
nodding
banneroles
and
pensils
aslant
their
spears
rose
like
the
slim
masts
of
many
sloops
in
a
harbour
the
sun
shone
the
green
woods
beckoned
to
the
glittering
mass
with
its
forest
of
rolling
spears
flavian
s
pride
whimpered
as
he
rode
in
the
van
with
modred
godamar
who
bore
the
banner
of
gambrevault
and
merlion
d
or
his
herald
the
man
felt
like
a
zeus
with
a
thunderbolt
poised
in
his
hand
a
word
the
flash
of
a
sword
the
cry
of
a
trumpet
and
all
this
splendid
torrent
of
steel
would
leap
and
thunder
to
work
his
will
the
star
of
chivalry
shone
bright
in
the
heavens
as
for
this
woman
on
the
white
horse
the
madonna
of
the
pine
forest
god
and
the
saints
he
would
charge
the
whole
world
hell
and
its
legions
to
win
so
rich
a
prize
turning
northwards
with
scouts
scattered
in
the
far
van
they
drew
to
wilder
regions
where
the
dark
and
saturnine
outposts
of
the
great
pine
forest
stood
solemn
upon
the
hills
dusky
were
the
thickets
against
the
sapphire
sky
the
cloud
banners
trailing
in
the
breeze
the
very
valleys

that
summer
day
flavian
saw
life
at
its
zenith
as
he
rode
through
the
woods
on
the
way
to
gambrevault
the
horse
had
dropped
to
a
trot
and
the
man
had
taken
off
his
helmet
and
hung
it
at
his
he
was
still
red
from
the
mÃªlÃ©e
his
eyes
were
bright
and
triumphant
the
girl
at
his
side
looked
at
him
a
tremor
upon
her
lip
her
glances
clouded
the
terrific
action
of
the
last
hour
still
seemed
to
weigh
upon
her
senses
and
she
seemed
fated
to
be
the
sport
of
contending
sentiments
no
sooner
had
she
struggled
to
some
level
of
saintliness
than
love
rushed
in
with
burning
wings
and
lo
all
the
tinsel
of
her
religion
fell
away
and
she
was
a
mere
eve
a
child
of
nature
flavian
watched
her
with
the
tenderness
of
a
strong
man
who
is
ready
to
give
his
life
for
the
woman
he
serves
love
seemed
to
rise
from
her
and
play
upon
him
like
perfume
from
a
bowl
of
violets
her
eyes
transfigured
him
and
he
longed
to
touch
her
hair

so
long
as

is
loose
he
looked
round
upon
the
sea
of
men
that
rolled
on
every
hand
and
war
at
its
worst
i
have
seen
enough
in
three
days
to
make
me
loathe
your
partisans
and
their
principles
perhaps
it
is
a
wicked
and
inhuman
business
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
she
said
remove
you
from
the
hands
of
butchers
and
put
you
like
a
pearl
in
a
casket
in
my
own
castle
of
gambrevault
you
incur
the
greater
peril
have
i
not
told
you
that
no
woman
loves
a
coward
she
was
silent
awhile
with
her
eyes
wistful
and
melancholy
as
though
some
spiritual
conflict
were
passing
in
her
mind
bitterness
escaped
in
the
man
s
words
for
all
his
tenderness
and
chivalry
he
needed
an
answer
anon
she
capitulated
and
appeared
to
surrender
herself
absolutely
to
circumstance
she
began
to
tell
flavian
of
her
adoption
by
fulviac
of
her
vision
in
the
ruined
chapel
of
the
part
assigned
to
her
as
a
woman
ordained
by
heaven
he
heard
her
in
silence
finding
quaint
pleasure
in
listening
to
her
voice
having
never
heard
her
talk
at
such
length
before
her
voice
s
modulations
its
pathos
its
many
tones
were
more
subtle
to
him
than
any
music
and
seemed
to
steep
in
oblivion
the
grim
realities
of
the
last
few
days
he
watched
the
play
of
thought
upon
her
face
sun
and
shadow
calm
and
unrest
he
began
to
comprehend
the
discords
he
had
flung
into
her
life
she
was
no
longer
a
riddle
to
him
her
confessions
portrayed
her
soul
in
warm
and
delicate
colouring
colouring
pathetic
and
heroically
pure
he
had
a
glorious
sense
of
joy
in
an
instinctive
conviction
that
this
girl
was
worthy
of
all
the
highest
chivalry
a
man
s
heart
can
conceive
of
though
he
had
a
strong
suspicion
that
he
could
humanise
her
madonna
for
her
he
refrained
from
argument
refrained
from
dilating
on
the
iniquities
her
crusades
had
already
perpetrated
moreover
the
girl
had
opened
her
heart
to
him
with
a
delicious
and
innocent
ingenuousness
he
felt
that
the
hour
had
blessed
him
sufficiently
that
personalities
would
be
gross
and
impertinent
in
the
light
of
that
sympathy
that
seemed
suddenly
to
have
enveloped
them
like
a
golden
cloud
the
girl
appeared
to
have
surrendered
herself
spiritually
into
his
keeping
not
sorry
in
measure
that
a
strong
destiny
had
decided
her
doubts
for
her
they
were
to
let
political
considerations
and
the
ephemeral
turmoils
of
the
times
sink
under
their
feet
it
was
sufficient
for
them
to
be
but
a
man
and
a
woman
to
forget
the
forbidden
fruit
and
the
serpent
and
his
lore
god
walked
the
world
they
were
not
ashamed
to
hear
his
voice
so
they
came
with
their
glittering
horde
of
horsemen
to
gambrevault
and
rode
over
the
green
downs
with
towers
beckoning
from
the
blue
the
gilderoy
forces
were
still
miles
away
and
could
not
have
threatened
the
retreat
on
gambrevault
had
they
been
wise
as
to
the
event
yeoland
rode
close
at
flavian
s
side
he
touched
her
hand
looked
in
her
eyes
saw
the
colour
stream
to
her
cheeks
knew
that
she
no
longer
was
his
enemy
yonder
stands
gambrevault
were
his
words
its
walls

bulwark
you
against
the
world
trust
me
and
my
eternal
faith
to
you
i
shall
see

more
clearly
for
looking
in
your
eyes
he
lodged
her
in
a
chamber
in
the
keep
a
room
that
had
been
his
mother
s
and
still
held
the
furniture
books
and
music
she
had
used
its
window
looked
out
on
the
castle
garden
and
over
the
double
line
of
walls
to
the
meadows
and
woods
beyond

the
castellan

her
the
keys
of
his

chests
where
silks

installed
in

their
unapproachableness
and
the
mute
pathos
of

himself
spent
more
than

in

before

and
absolution
that
evening
at

came
down
to

with
the
castellan

two
girls
to
serve
her
as
maids
of

had
put

and
was
clad
in
a

of

fitting
close
to

seemed
to
have
lost

of

restraint
much
of
her
independence
of
her
reserve

short
hours
her
mood
inclined
towards
silence
and

delightful
solemnity
such
as
a
lover
loves
her
eyes
met
the
man
s
with
a
rare
trust
her
hands
went
into
his
with
all
the
ideal
faith
he
had
forecast
in
his
dreams
they
stood
together
under
the
yews
full
of
youth
and
innocent
joy
of
soul
timid
happily
sad
content
to
be
mere
children
flavian
touched
her
hands
as
he
would
have
touched
a
lily
she
seemed
too
wonderful
too
pure
too
transcendent
to
be
fingered
a
supreme
a
godly
timidity
possessed
him
he
had
such
love
in
his
heart
as
only
the
strong
and
the
pure
can
know
such
love
as
makes
a
man
a
saint
unto
himself
a
being
wrapped
round
with
the
rarest
chivalry
of
heaven
their
words
were
very
simple
and
infrequent
i
have
been
thinking
said
the
girl
yes
how
war
seems
ever
in
the
world
how
else
should
i
have
won
you
she
sighed
and
looked
up
over
his
shoulder
at
the
sunlight
glimmering
gold
through
the
yews
i
have
been
thinking
how
i
bring
you
infinite
peril
they
will
not
lose
me
easily
what
if
i
bring
you
to
ruin
i
take
everything
to
myself
they
believe
me
a
saint
and
i
my
conscience
will
reproach
me
but
now
well
i
am
too
happy
to
remember
their
eyes
met
and
flashed
all
the
unutterable
truths
of
the
soul
flavian
kissed
her
hand
forget
it
all
he
said
save
the
words
i
spoke
to
you
over
that
forest
grave
whatever
doom
may
come
upon
me
though
death
frown
i
care
not
all
the
sky
is
at
sunset
all
the
world
is
full
of
song
i
could
meet
god
with
a
smile
since
you
have
shown
me
all
your
heart
from
a
little
stone
pavilion
hidden
by
laurels
the
voices
of
flutes
and
viols
swirled
out
upon
the
air
the
west
grew
faint
and
twilight
increased
night
kissed
and
closed
the
azure
eyes
of
the
day
under
the
yew
boughs
flavian
and
yeoland
walked
hand
in
hand
the
music
spoke
for
them
the
night
made
their
faces
pale
and
spiritual
under
the
trees
they
said
little
a
tremor
of
the
fingers
a
glance
a
sigh
were
enough
when
the
west
had
faded
and
the
last
primrose
streak
was
gone
flavian
kissed
the
girl
s
lips
and
sent
her
back
to
the
two
children
who
were
curled
on
a
bench
by
the
laurels
listening
sleepily
to
the
music
of
flute
and
viol
the
man
s
soul
was
too
scintillant
and
joyous
to
shun
the
stars
he
passed
up
on
to
the
battlements
and
listened
to
the
long
surge
of
the
summer
sea
and
as
he
paced
the
battlements
that
night
he
saw
red
impish
specks
of
flame
start
out
against
the
black
background
of
the
night
they
were
the
rebel
watchfires
burning
on
the
hills
sinister
eyes
red
with
the
distant
prophecy
of
war
xxxi
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
thundercloud
of
thought
that
came
down
upon
fulviac
s
face
when
news
was
brought
him
of
the
capture
of
the
girl
yeoland
and
the
decimation
of
the
vanguard
from
geraint
there
was
something
even
satanic
upon
his
face
for
the
moment
he
was
not
a
pleasant
person
when
roused
and
roused
he
was
that
day
like
any
ogre
his
tongue
ran
through
the
whole
gamut
of
blasphemy
before
he
recovered
a
finer
dignity
and
relapsed
into
a
grim
reserve
his
men
spoke
to
him
with
great
suavity
he
had
decreed
that
nord
of
the
hammer
should
be
hanged
for
negligence
but
the
decree
was
unnecessary
since
flavian
s
sword
had
already
settled
the
matter
the
gilderoy
forces
therefore
turned
northwards
with
their
great
baggage
and
siege
train
and
in
due
course
came
upon
the
gerainters
bivouacking
on
the
ridge
where
the
battle
had
taken
place
the
green
slopes
were
specked
with
dark
motionless
figures
dead
horses
and
the
wreckage
of
war
men
were
burying
the
dead
upon
the
battlefield
yeoland
s
guard
had
been
slaughtered
almost
to
a
man
and
the
whole
affair
had
damped
very
considerably
the
ardour
of
certain
of
the
less
trustworthy
levies
but
fulviac
was
not
the
man
to
sit
and
snivel
over
a
defeat
he
knew
well
enough
that
he
had
good
men
behind
him
tough
fighting
stuff
fired
by
fanaticism
and
a
long
sense
of
wrong
he
harangued
his
whole
force
with
his
lion
s
roar
those
concerned
in
the
march
from
geraint
treating
them
to
such
a
scourging
with
words
that
they
snarled
and
clamoured
to
be
led
on
at
once
to
prove
their
mettle
their
leaders
had
been
at
fault
nor
did
fulviac
keep
their
spirits
cooling
in
the
wind
the
power
of
his
own
personality
was
great
and
he
had
twenty
thousand
men
at
his
back
who
knew
that
to
fail
meant
death
and
torture
they
had
received
a
check
from
the
lord
of
gambrevault
it
was
absolutely
essential
to
the
cause
that
they
should
wipe
out
the
defeat
recapture
their
saint
and
sacred
banner
crush
gambrevault
once
and
for
ever
to
this
strenuous
tune
they
marched
on
towards
the
sea
and
that
night
lit
their
fires
on
the
hills
that
ringed
gambrevault
on
the
north
as
the
sun
climbed
up
and
spread
a
curtain
of
gold
over
down
and
upland
those
on
the
walls
of
gambrevault
saw
steel
glinting
on
the
hills
the
pikes
and
casques
of
fulviac
s
horde
yeoland
saw
them
from
her
casement
as
she
stood
and
combed
her
hair
flavian
watching
with
certain
knights
on
the
keep
confronted
the
event
with
a
merry
smile
the
shimmering
line
of
silver
on
the
hills
had
broadened
to
a
darker
band
splashed
lavishly
with
steel
the
rebel
host
was
coming
on
in
a
half
moon
with
each
horn
to
the
sea
its
centre
held
towards
the
ford
and
the
dismantled
gambrevault
mills
positions
strongly
held
on
the
southern
bank
by
a
redoubt
and
stockaded
trenches
the
criticisms
delivered
by
those
watching
from
the
keep
were
various
and
forcible
by
jeremy
a
rare
mob
let
them
grip
at
gambrevault
said
modred
and
they
shall
clutch
at
a
cactus
look
at
that
long
baggage
train
in
the
rear
damn
them
i
guess
they
have
the
siege
train
from
gilderoy
we
shall
sweat
a
trifle
quoth
tristram
they
have
little
time
to
spare
for
a
leaguer
rotting
in
trenches
if
they
are
to
make
the
country
rise
they
ll
not
leaguer
us
flavian
watched
the
advance
under
his
hand
fortunately
or
unfortunately
gentlemen
he
said
we
have
taken
their
saint
their
oracle
and
their
sacred
banner
i
imagine
they
will
do
their
best
to
dispossess
us
it
is
time
we
made
for
the
meadows
i
reckon
we
shall
have
hot
work
when
leaving
the
keep
flavian
crossed
the
castle
garden
and
caught
under
the
tunnel
of
yews
the
flutter
of
a
woman
s
gown
sunlight
glimmered
through
and
wove
a
shimmering
network
in
the
air
green
and
violet
swept
the
stones
a
white
face
shone
in
the
shadows
he
went
to
her
and
kissed
her
hands
his
eyes
were
brave
and
joyous
as
she
looked
into
them
and
there
was
no
shadow
of
fear
upon
his
face
trumpets
were
blowing
in
the
meadows
piercing
the
confused
hum
of
men
running
to
arms
war
ever
war
you
are
sad
fulviac
has
the
whole
kingdom
at
his
back
if
he
led
the
world
i
should
not
waver
with
me
it
is
different
i
am
a
woman
and
you
know
my
heart
so
well
that
i
seek
to
know
nothing
else
in
the
world
i
desire
no
greater
wisdom
than
my
love
you
are
with
me
and
my
heart
sings
no
harm
can
come
to
you
whatever
doom
may
fall
on
gambrevault
think
you
my
thoughts
are
all
of
my
own
safety
ah
golden
one
never
fear
for
me
what
is
life
a
little
joy
a
little
pain
and
then
eternity
i
would
rather
have
an
hour
s
glory
in
the
sun
than
fifty
years
of
grey
monotony
it
is
something
to
fight
and
even
to
die
for
the
love
of
a
woman
there
is
no
shadow
over
my
soul
there
was
a
great
heroism
in
his
voice
and
her
eyes
caught
the
light
from
his
she
touched
his
cuirass
with
her
slim
white
fingers
god
keep
you
ha
i
do
not
smell
of
earth
nor
dream
of
requiems
no
you
will
come
back
to
me
give
me
your
scarf
she
took
the
green
silk
and
knotted
it
about
his
arm
a
rich
colour
shone
in
her
cheeks
her
eyes
were
warm
and
wonderfully
luminous
god
keep
you
so
he
kissed
her
lips
and
left
her
the
rebel
horde
had
rolled
down
in
their
thousands
from
the
hills
flavian
saw
their
black
masses
moving
from
the
woods
as
he
rode
down
from
the
great
gate
it
was
evident
to
him
that
fulviac
would
try
and
force
the
ford
and
win
his
way
to
the
open
meadows
beyond
the
river
ran
fast
with
a
deep
but
narrow
channel
and
there
was
only
one
other
ford
some
nine
miles
upstream
his
own
men
were
under
arms
in
the
meadows
with
his
knights
round
him
flavian
rode
down
to
the
redoubt
and
trenches
by
the
packed
as
they
already
were
with
archers
and
he
was
loudly
cheered
as
he
reined
in
and
scanned
the
rebel
columns
moving
over
the
downs
fulviac
had
ridden
forward
with
a
company
of
spears
to
reconnoitre
he
saw
the
captured
banner
of
the
maid
hoisted
derisively
on
gambrevault
keep
he
saw
the
redoubt
and
the
stockades
covering
the
ford
the
foot
massed
in
the
meadows
flavian
s
mounted
drawn
up
under
the
castle
walls
sforza
and
several
captains
of
note
were
with
fulviac
the
man
was
in
a
grim
mood
a
slashing
titanic
humour
the
passage
of
the
river
was
to
be
forced
flavian
s
men
engaged
in
the
meadows
he
would
drive
them
into
gambrevault
before
nightfall
then
they
would
cast
their
leaguer
bring
up
the
siege
train
taken
from
gilderoy
and
batter
at
gambrevault
till
they
could
storm
the
place
early
in
the
day
fulviac
detached
a
body
of
two
thousand
men
under
colgran
a
noted
to
march
upstream
cross
by
the
upper
ford
and
threaten
flavian
on
the
flank
the
fighting
began
at
ten
of
the
clock
when
fulviac
s
bowmen
scattered
along
the
river
and
opened
fire
upon
the
stockades
flavian
s
archers
and
arbalisters
responded
a
body
of
five
thousand
rebels
advanced
with
great
mantlets
upon
wheels
to
the
northern
bank
and
entrenched
themselves
there
a
second
body
with
waggons
laden
with
timber
and
several
boats
poured
down
to
the
river
a
mile
higher
up
and
began
to
throw
a
rough
bridge
across
the
stream
at
ten
masses
of
splashed
through
the
water
at
the
ford
under
cover
of
a
hot
fire
from
the
archers
lining
the
bank
and
began
an
assault
upon
the
redoubt
and
the
stockades
by
twelve
o
clock
the
bridge
higher
up
the
stream
had
been
completed
and
a
glittering
line
of
pikes
poured
across
to
be
met
on
the
southern
bank
by
geoffrey
longsword
and
a
body
of
it
was
hand
to
hand
and
hot
and
strenuous
as
could
be
men
grappled
stabbed
hacked
bellowed
like
a
herd
of
bulls
flavian
had
reinforced
the
defenders
of
the
ford
who
still
held
fulviac
at
bay
despite
a
heavy
archery
fire
and
the
almost
continuous
assaults
poured
against
the
stockades
yet
by
one
o
clock
fulviac
s
levies
had
forced
the
passage
of
the
bridge
and
gained
footing
on
the
southern
bank
longsword
s
men
outnumbered
and
repulsed
were
falling
back
before
the
black
masses
of
foot
that
now
poured
into
the
meadows
the
situation
was
critical
enough
as
flavian
had
long
seen
as
he
galloped
hotly
from
point
to
point
fulviac
s
rebels
had
shown
more
valour
than
he
had
ever
prophesied
flavian
packed
all
his
remaining
foot
into
the
trenches
and
putting
himself
at
the
head
of
his
knights
and
mounted
rode
down
to
charge
the
troops
who
had
crossed
by
the
pontoons
here
chivalry
availed
him
to
the
full
by
a
succession
of
tremendous
rushes
he
drove
the
rebels
back
into
the
river
did
much
merciless
slaughter
cut
the
ropes
that
held
the
bridge
to
the
southern
bank
so
that
the
whole
structure
veered
downstream
the
peril
seemed
past
when
he
was
startled
by
the
cry
that
the
redoubt
had
been
carried
and
that
fulviac
held
the
ford
looking
south
he
saw
the
truth
with
his
own
eyes
his
troops
were
falling
back
in
disorder
upon
gambrevault
followed
by
an
mass
that
swarmed
exultantly
into
the
meadows
the
last
and
successful
assault
had
been
led
by
fulviac
in
person
flavian
had
to
grip
the
truth
the
rebels
outnumbered
him
by
more
than
five
to
one
and
he
had
underrated
their
discipline
and
fighting
spirit
he
was
wiser
before
the
sun
went
down
come
gentlemen
we
shall
beat
them
yet
shall
we
charge
them
sire
blow
bugles
follow
me
sirs
i
am
in
no
mood
for
defeat
that
afternoon
there
was
grim
work
in
the
gambrevault
meadows
five
times
flavian
charged
fulviac
s
columns
hurling
them
back
towards
the
river
only
to
be
repulsed
in
turn
by
the
fresh
masses
that
poured
over
by
the
ford
he
made
much
slaughter
lost
many
good
men
in
the
mad
whirling
mÃªlÃ©es
desperate
heroism
inspired
on
either
hand
once
he
stood
in
great
peril
of
his
own
life
having
been
unhorsed
and
surrounded
by
a
mob
of
rebel
pikes
he
was
saved
by
the
devotion
and
heroism
of
modred
and
his
household
knights
with
the
chivalry
of
a
galahad
he
did
all
that
a
man
could
to
keep
the
field
colgran
s
flanking
column
appeared
over
the
downs
and
fulviac
had
his
whole
host
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
river
the
masses
advanced
like
one
man

flying
trumpets
clanging
flavian
would
have
charged
again
but
for
the
vehement
dissuasion
of
certain
of
his
elder
knights
he
contented
himself
with
covering
the
retreat
of
his
foot
while
the
great
gate
of
gambrevault
opened
its
black
maw
to
take
them
in
many
of
his
mercenaries
had
deserted
to
the
rebels
so
stubborn
and
bloody
had
been
the
day
that
he
had
lost
close
upon
half
his
force
by
death
and
desertion
no
quarter
had
been
given
on
either
side
he
heard
the
surging
shouts
of
exultation
from
the
meadows
as
he
rode
sullen
and
wearied
into
gambrevault
the
great
gates
thundered
to
the
portcullises

down
fulviac
had
his
man
shut
up
in

the
leaguer
was
drawn
that
night
about
the
towers
of

the

permitted

there
were

brought
no

boon
to

were
masterful
enough
with
an

serve
them
but
behind

held
the
advantage

their
gigantic
arms
arbalisters
wound
their
windlasses
behind
the
ramparts
shot
screamed
and
hurtled
crashed
and
thundered
against
the
walls
bringing
down
mortar
and
masonry
in
rattling
showers
the
battlements
of
gambrevault
spouted
flame
archers
plied
their
bows
in
bartisan
and
turret
a
shroud
of
dust
and
smoke
swirled
about
the
place
the
chaotic
clamour
of
the
siege
sending
the
gulls
wheeling
and
wailing
from
the
cliffs
on
the
very
second
day
flavian
was
brought
low
by
a
shot
hurling
a
fragment
of
masonry
upon
his
thigh
and
bruising
it
to
the
bone
stiff
and
faint
he
was
laid
abed
in
his
own
state
room
unable
to
stir
for
the
twinging
tendons
loth
enough
to
lie
idle
modred
bluff
lusty
smiter
took
the
command
from
him
and
walked
the
walls
hourly
he
came
in
to
his
lord
s
chamber
to
tell
of
the
cannonade
and
the
state
of
the
castle
even
flavian
from
his
cushions
could
see
that
the
man
s
black
face
looked
grim
and
sinister
how
do
they
vex
us
was
his
question
as
the
thunder
came
to
them
from
the
meadows
modred
clinked
his
heels
against
the
wainscotting
of
the
window
seat
and
strove
to
sweeten
his
looks
he
was
not
a
man
given
to
blandishing
the
truth
their
damned
bombards
are
too
heavy
for
us
we
are
dumb
impossible
sire
we
shall
have
to
hold
gambrevault
by
the
sword
the
man
on
the
bed
started
up
on
his
elbow
only
to
fall
back
again
with
a
spasmodic
twitching
of
the
forehead
and
our
bombards
he
asked
are
toppled
off
their
trunnions
ha
for
the
rest
sire
i
have
ordered
our
men
to
keep
cover
the
bowmen
shoot
passably
the
outer
battlements
are
swept
and
the
walls
modred
grimaced
and
stroked
his
beard
there
are
cracks
in
the
quoth
he
that
i
could
lay
my
fist
in
what
goodlier
fortune
for
a
man
than
to
lie
bruised
when
love
bears
to
him
the
bowl
of
dreams
what
softer
balm
than
the
touch
of
a
woman
s
hand
what
more
subtle
music
than
her
voice
the
girl
yeoland
had
betrayed
a
new
wilfulness
to
the
world
in
that
she
now
claimed
as
her
guerdon
the
care
of
the
man
s
heart
she
was
in
and
about
his
room
a
shadow
moving
in
the
sunlight
a
shaft
of
youth
supple
and
very
tender
her
eyes
had
a
rarer
lustre
her
face
more
of
the
dawn
tint
of
the
rose
love
stirred
within
her
soul
like
the
sound
of
angels
psaltering
on
the
golden
battlements
of
heaven
as
she
sat
often
beside
him
flavian
won
the
whole
romance
from
her
gradual
as
glistening
threads
of
silk
drawn
from
a
scarlet
purse
she
waxed
very
solemn
over
her
tale
was
timid
at
times
and
exceeding
sorrowful
for
all
her
passion
some
shadowy
fear
seemed
to
companion
her
beside
the
couch
some
wraith
prophetic
of
a
tragic
end
she
loved
the
man
yet
feared
her
love
even
as
it
had
been
a
sword
shimmering
above
his
head
peril
compassed
them
like
an
angry
sea
she
heard
the
bombards
thundering
in
the
meadows
ah
sire
she
said
to
him
one
morning
as
she
thrust
the
flowers
she
had
gathered
in
the
garden
into
a
brazen
bowl
i
am
heavy
at
heart
who
shall
pity
me
he
turned
towards
her
on
his
cushions
with
a
smile
that
was
not
prophetic
of
the
tomb
do
i
weary
you
ah
no
not
that
why
then
are
you
sad
she
held
up
a
white
hand
in
the
gloom
of
the
room
her
hair
falling
like
a
black
cloud
upon
her
bosom
listen
she
said
to
him
i
am
not
deaf
the
thunder
of
war
well
well
my
heart
should
i
fear
it
it
is
i
who
fear
ah
he
said
taking
her
hand
into
his
bosom
put
such
fears
far
from
you
we
shall
not
end
this
year
in
dust
a
week
passed
and
the
man
was
on
the
walls
again
bold
and
ruddy
as
a
youthful
jove
seven
days
had
gone
swelling
with
their
hours
the
great
concourse
in
the
meadows
pikes
had
sprouted
on
the
hills
like
glistening
corn
to
roll
and
merge
into
the
girding
barrier
of
steel
the
disloyal
south
had
gathered
to
fulviac
before
gambrevault
like
dust
in
a
dry
corner
in
the
month
of
march
a
great
host
teemed
betwixt
the
river
and
the
cliffs
through
all
the
rack
and
thunder
of
the
siege
went
on
drowning
the
sea
s
voice
flinging
a
over
the
stubborn
walls
in
gambrevault
men
looked
grim
and
muttered
of
succour
and
the
armies
of
the
king
yet
flavian
was
content
he
had
taken
a
transcendent
spirit
into
his
soul
he
lived
to
music
drank
love
and
chivalry
like
nectar
from
the
gods
the
woman
s
nearness
made
each
hour
a
chalice
of
gold
he
possessed
her
red
heart
looked
deep
into
her
eyes
put
her
slim
hands
into
his
bosom
her
voice
haunted
him
like
music
out
of
heaven
he
was
a
dreamer
a
whose
brain
seemed
laden
with
all
the
perfumes
of
the
east
ready
was
he
to
drain
the
purple
wine
of
life
even
to
the
dregs
and
to
find
death
in
the
cup
if
the
fates
so
willed
it
and
fulviac
war
had
held
a
poniard
at
his
throat
turning
him
to
the
truth
with
the
threat
of
steel
grim
and
implacable
he
stalked
the
meadows
bending
his
brows
upon
the
towers
of
gambrevault
this
girl
of
the
woods
was
no
more
a
dream
to
him
but
supple
love
ardent
flesh
reality
lean
leering
thoughts
taunted
the
lascivious
fears
within
his
brain
his
moods
were
silent
yet
tempestuous
gambrevault
mocked
him
vengeance
burnt
in
his
palm
like
a
globe
of
molten
iron
his
dogged
temper
roused
his
captains
to
strenuous
debate
fifty
thousand
men
were
idle
before
the
place
and
the
siege
dragged
like
a
homily
their
insinuations
were
strong
and
strident
the
countryside
was
emptying
its
broad
larder
malgo
and
godamar
of

marching
from

fulviac
to
pluck
up
his
spears
and
march
on
lauretia
proud
city
of
the
king
for
a
season
fulviac
was
stubborn
as
gambrevault
itself
his
yellow
eyes
glittered
and
he
tossed
back
his
lion
s
mane
from
off
his
forehead
till
the
place
is
ours
so
ran
his
dogma
i
stir
never

at

with

northwards
from

leaving

his
ten
thousand

flavian
saw
the
black
columns
curl
away
over
the
green
slopes
their
pikes
glittering
against
the
blue
fringe
of
the
horizon
their
banners
blowing
to
the
breeze
the
red
pavilion
stood
no
longer
in
the
meadows
the
man
on
the
black
horse
rode
no
more
behind
the
barricades
ominous
was
the
marching
of
the
host
over
the
hills
a
prophecy
of
many
battles
before
the

men
could
succour

between

dammed
behind
the

the

were

and
ruinous

gaped
and
tottered
still
the
bombards
thundered
hurling
their
salvos
of
shot
against
the
place
belching
flame
even
through
the
night
while
the
arms
of
the
great
slings
toiled
like
giant
hands
in
the
dark
as
for
the

yeoland
her
joy
was

mocked
with

was
the

nook
left
her
open
to
the
blue
hope
of

the
clamour
of
the

woke
a
hundred
echoes
in
her
heart

face
and

eyes
above

of

upon

despite

chaotic
state
flavian
clung
to
the
ruin
and
held
the
stormers
at

thrice
colgran

rebels
advanced
to
the
attack
and
came
with
the
defenders
over
the
crumbling
piles
of

they
were
beaten
back
and
driven
to
retreat
upon

trenches
colgran
renounced

the
slings
and
bombards
were
turned
upon
the
outer
wall
to
widen
the
breach
already
made
therein
it
was
plain
enough
even
to
yeoland
that
the
siege
was
bearing
slowly
yet
surely
against
gambrevault
more
than
half
a
month
had
passed
and
still
no
succouring
spears
shone
upon
the
hills
no
sail
upon
the
sea
poor
food
and
summer
heat
the
crowding
of
the
garrison
had
opened
a
gate
to
fever
and
disease
she
saw
the
stern
and
moody
faces
of
the
soldiery
their
loyalty
that
took
fresh
and
hectic
fire
from
the
courage
of
their
lord
she
saw
the
broken
walls
and
ruined
battlements
and
heard
the
rebels
shouting
in
their
trenches
as
the
man
s
peril
grew
more
real
and
significant
a
fear
more
vehement
entered
into
her
heart
sleep
left
her
she
began
to
look
white
and
weary
with
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
the
man
s
warm
youth
accused
her
like
a
tree
that
should
soon
be
smitten
by
the
axe
his
fine
heroism
was
a
veritable
scourge
making
the
future
full
of
discords
a
glimmering
with
bleached
bones
she
began
to
know
how
closely
their
lives
were
mingled
even
as
wine
in
a
cup
of
gold
he
was
lord
and
husband
to
her
in
the
spirit
her
red
heart
quaked
for
him
like
the
shivering
petals
of
an
autumn
rose
on
the
day
of
the
assault
upon
the
he
came
back
to
her
wounded
in
the
arm
and
shoulder
he
was
faint
but
brave
and
even
merry
she
would
suffer
none
to
come
in
to
him
as
he
sat
in
a
carved
chair
in
her
room
that
opened
on
the
garden
the
sight
of
blood
when
harness
and
gamboison
were
taken
from
the
caked
wounds
quickened
her
fears
into
a
fever
of
she
bathed
the
wounds
and
dressed
them
with
fragrant
oil
and
linen
twilight
filled
the
room
and
it
was
not
till
her
tears
fell
upon
his
hand
that
the
man
found
that
she
was
weeping
he
drew
her
towards
him
with
sudden
great
tenderness
as
she
knelt
and
looked
into
his
face
her
eyes
swam
with
tears
her
lips
quivered
my
life
why
do
you
weep
she
started
away
from
him
with
sudden
strength
and
stood
by
the
window
trembling
give
me
my
armour
and
my
banner
she
said
let
me
ride
to
the
trenches
and
barter
terms
by
my
surrender
sire
let
me
go
let
me
go
he
looked
at
her
sadly
under
his
brows
with
forehead
wrinkled
you
would
leave
me
ah
yes
to
save
you
from
the
sword
is
it
easy
for
me
to
ask
you
this
you
crave
more
than
i
can
give
no
no
i
can
not
surrender
you
and
for
love
you
would
doom
all
gambrevault
ah
he
cried
i
am
wounded
and
you
would
wound
me
the
more
she
gave
a
whimper
of
pain
ran
to
him
and
crept
into
his
arms
as
her
sobs
shook
her
he
bent
many
times
and
kissed
her
hair
weep
not
for
me
he
said
even
when
the
end
comes
no
harm
can
touch
you
i
can
not
parley
with
these
wolves
there
are
women
and
children
under
my
roof
should
i
open
my
gates
to
a
savage
mob
this
is
your
doom
she
said
to
him
i
take
it
child
from
heaven
she
wept
no
more
for
a
richer
heroism
took
fire
within
her
heart
she
knelt
to
the
man
while
he
held
her
face
betwixt
his
hands
bent
over
her
and
kissed
her
forehead
courage
courage
what
is
death
my
god
to
lose
you
there
am
i
not
flesh
and
blood
god
knows
i
would
rather
have
death
than
give
you
to
these
vultures
she
knelt
before
him
with
her
face
transfigured
and
death
death
can
touch
me
also
xxxiv
august
came
in
with
storm
and
rain
and
a
dreary
wind
blew
from
the
huddling
masses
of
cloud
over
a
spiritless
sky
southwards
the
sea
tumbled
a
grey
expanse
edged
with
foam
its
great
breakers
booming
dismally
upon
the
cliffs
the
wind
swept
over
gambrevault
moaning
and
wailing
over
battlement
and
tower
driving
the
rain
in
drifting
sheets
the
bombards
still
belched
and
smoked
under
their
penthouses
and
the
arms
of
the
catapults
rose
and
fell
against
the
sullen
sky
the
eighteenth
night
of
the
siege
came
out
of
the
east
like
a
thunder
bank
and
the
grey
shivering
ghost
of
the
day
fled
over
the
western
hills
when
darkness
had
fallen
the
walls
of
gambrevault
were
invisible
from
the
trenches
here
and
there
a
light
shone
out
like
a
spark
in
tinder
the

watch
upon
the

strong
company

he
had
taken
the

measure
of
the

had
prepared
accordingly

slept
wrapped
in
their
cloaks
with
their

lying
by

the
sentinels
had
been
doubled
on
the
battlements
though
little
could
be
seen
in
the
blank
murk
and
even
the
keep
had
to
be
looked
for
before
its
mass
disjointed
itself
from
the
background
of
the
night
it
was
treacherous
weather
and
just
the
season
for
an
adventurous
enemy
to
creep
from
the
trenches
and
attempt
to
rush
the
breach
flavian

upon
his
long
sword
and
brooded

black
ends
of
the
broken

up
hugely
on

a
rough
rampart

been
piled
along

around
him
shone
the
dull
armour
of
his
men
as
they
stood
on
guard
in
the
rain
the
storm
deadened
soul
and
body
yet
kept
flavian
vigilant
with
its
boisterous
laughter
a
sound
that
might
stifle
the
tramp
of
stormers
pouring
to
the
breach
he
was
not
lonely

do
without
the
confidences

the

asceticism

produce
flavian
s
figure
straightened
suddenly
as
it
leant
bowed
in
thought
upon
the
sword
he
was
alert
and
vigilant
staring
into
darkness
that
baffled
vision
and
hid
the
unknown
a
dull
characterless
sound
was
in
the
air
whether
it
was
the
wind
the
sea
or
something
more
sinister
he
could
not
tell
calling
one
of
his
knights
to
his
side
they
stood
together
listening
on
the
wreckage
of
the
wall
a
vague
clink
clink
came
in
discord
to
the
wind
a
sound
that
suggested
the
cautious
moving
of
armed
men
a
hoarse
voice
was
growling
warily
in
the
distance
as
though
giving
orders
the
shrilling
noise
of
steel
grew
more
obvious
each
moment
the
black
void
below
appeared
to
grow
full
of
movement
to
swirl
and
eddy
like
a
lagoon
whose
muddy
waters
are
disturbed
by
some
huge
reptile

cries

from

on

a
trumpet
blared
in

entry
the

closed
up
on
the
rampart
sleeping
men
started
from
the
shadows
of

as
the
trumpets

rang
in

ears
colgran

stormers
discovered
in
their

cast
caution
to
the
winds
and
sent
up
a
shout
that
should
have
wakened
all
gambrevault
in
the
darkness
and
the
driving
rain
neither
party
could
see
much
of
the
other
the
stormers
came
climbing
blindly
up
the
pile
of
wreckage
in
serried
masses
flavian
and
his
knights
who
held
the
rampart
big
men
and
smote
at
the
black
tide
of
bodies
that
rolled
to
their
swords
it
was
grim
work
in
the
dark
it
was
no
sleepy
disorderly
rabble
that
held
the
breach
but
a
tense
line
of
steel
that
stemmed
the
assault
like
a
wall
the
stormers
pushed
up
and
up
to
break
and
deliquesce
before
those
terrible
swords
modred

deep
voice
sounded
through
the
din
as
he
smote
with
his
great
axe
blows
that
would
have
shaken
an
oak
there
was
little
shouting
it
was
breathless

done
in

a

of

to
their
credit
a
squirming
oozing
barrier
but
came
no
nearer
forcing
the
breach
they
had
lost
the
propitious
moment
and
the
whole

was
under

to
repulse

attacks
made
at

points

been
jerked
forward
and
reared
against

swarmed
up

the

gained
no
lasting
foothold
on

battlements
they
were
beaten
back
their
ladders
hurled
down
masonry
toppled
upon
the
mass
below
many
a

with

or
back
broken
in
the
confused
tangle
of
humanity
at
the
foot
of
the
castle
colgran
ordered
up
fresh
troops
it
was
his
policy
to
wear
out
the
garrison
by
sheer
importunity
and
the
stress
of
numbers
he
could
afford
to
lose
some
hundred
men
every
score
were
precious
now
to
flavian
it
was
a
system
of
counter
barter
in
blood
till
the
weaker
vessel
ran
dry
the
lord
of
gambrevault
understood
this
rough
philosophy
well
enough
and
husbanded
his
resources
he
could
not
gamble
with
death
and
so
changed
his
men
when
the
opportunity
offered
to
give
breathing
space
to
all
conscious
of
the
strong
stimulus
of
personal
heroism
he
kept
to
the
breach
himself
and
fought
on
through
every
assault
with
modred
s
great
axe
swinging
at
his
side
he
owed
his
life
more
than
once
to
those
arms

that
crescent
of
steel
in
the
outer
court

for

hovered
over
the
pale

the
fear
the
shivering

there
was

heroism
in

save
the
heroism
of
supplication
while

tossed
and

groped
for

the

times

that
night
each
repulse
leaving
its
husks
on
the
bloody
wreckage
its
red
libations
to
the
swords
of
gambrevault
the
last
and
toughest
tussle
came
during
the
grey
prologue
before
dawn
the
place
was
so
packed
with
the
dead
and
stricken
that
it
was
impassable
for
some
minutes
the
struggle
hung
precariously
on
the
summit
of
the
pass
but
with
the
dawn
the
peril
dwindled
and
elapsed
the
stormers
revolted
from
the
shambles
they
had
fought
their
fill
had
done
enough
for
honour
were
sick
and
weary
no
taunt
command
or
imprecation
could
keep
them
longer
in
that
gate
of
death
colgran
s
rebels
retreated
on
their
trenches
and
with
the
dawn
flavian
looked
round
upon
the
breach
and
saw
all
the
horror
of
the
place
in
one
brief
moment
cloven
faces
hacked
bodies
distortions
tortures
blood
everywhere
he
looked
round
over
his
own
men
saw
their
meagre
ranks
their
weariness
their
wounds
their
exultation
that
lapsed
silently
into
a
kind
of
desperate
awe
some
tried
to
cheer
him
and
at
the
sound
he
felt
an
unutterable
melancholy
descend
upon
his
soul
the
men
were
like
so
many
sickly
ghosts
a
wan
and
battered
flock
a
ragged
remnant
he
saw
the
whole
truth
in
a
moment
as
a
man
sees
life
death
and
eternity
pass
before
him
in
the
flashing
wisdom
of
a
single
thought
and
this
was
war
this
cataclysm
of
insatiate
wrath
his
men
were
too
few
too
bustled
to
hold
the
breach
against
such
another
storm
his
trumpets
blared
the
retreat
a
grim
and
tragic
fanfare
they
dragged
out
their
wounded
abandoned
the
pile
of
rubbish
for
which
they
had
fought
and
withdrew
sullenly
within
the
inner
walls
colgran
though
repulsed
had
taken
the
outer
ward
of
gambrevault
as
one
stumbling
from
a
dream
flavian
found
himself
in
the
castle
garden
the
place
was
full
of
the
freshness
that
follows
rain
and
it
was
not
till
the
scent
of
flowers
met
him
like
an
odour
of
peace
that
he
marked
that
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
dawn
like
saffron
the
had
gone
and
the
wind
was
a
mere
breeze
a
moist
breath
from
the
west
bearing
a
curious
contrast
to
the
furious
temper
of
the
night
flavian
looking
like
a
debauchee
limped
through
the
court
and
climbed
the
stairway
of
the
keep
to
the
banqueting
hall
and
his
own
state
chambers
several
of
his
knights
followed
him
at
a
distance
and
in
silence
he
felt
sick
as
a
dog
and
burdened
with
unutterable
care
that
weighed
upon
him
like
a
prophecy
he
had
held
the
breach
against
heavy
odds
and
he
was
brooding
over
the
cost
there
was
honour
in
the
sheer
physical
heroism
of
the
deed
but
he
had
lost
old
friends
and
tried
servants
had
sacrificed
his
outer
walls
there
was
little
cause
for
exultation
in
the
main
he
stumbled
into
the
banqueting
hall
like
a
man
into
a
tavern
wine
wine
for
the
love
of
god
a
slim
figure
in
green
came
out
from
the
oriel
and
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
quivered
over
the
man
s
grey
face
and
armour
the
girl
s
hands
went
out
to
him
and
she
seemed
like
a
child
roused
in
the
night
from
the
influence
of
some
evil
dream
you
are
wounded
she
took
him
by
the
arm
and
shoulder
and
was
able
to
force
him
into
a
chair
so
limp
so
impotent
was
he
for
the
moment
his
face
had
the
uncanny
pallor
of
one
who
was
about
to
faint
his
eyes
stared
at
her
in
a
dazed
and
wistful
way
my
god
you
are
not
going
to
die
he
shook
his
head
smiled
weakly
and
groped
for
her
hand
she
broke
away
brought
wine
and
began
to
trickle
it
between
his
lips
several
of
his
knights
came
in
and
looked
on
awkwardly
from
the
doorway
at
the
girl
leaning
over
the
man
s
chair
with
her
arm
under
his
head
yeoland
caught
sight
of
them
coloured
and
called
them
forward
the
man
s
faintness
had
passed
he
saw
modred
and
beckoned
him
to
his
chair
take
her
away
in
a
whisper
yeoland
heard
the
words
started
round
and
clung
to
his
hand
there
was
a
strange
look
upon
her
face
flavian
spoke
slowly
to
her
girl
i
am
not
a
savoury
object
fresh
from
the
carnage
of
a
breach
leave
me
to
my
surgeon
i
would
only
save
you
pain
as
for
dying
i
feel
like
an
adam
go
to
your
room
child
i
will
be
with
you
before
long
she
held
both
his
hands
looked
in
his
eyes
a
moment
then
turned
away
with
modred
and
left
him
she
was
very
pale
and
there
was
a
tremor
about
her
lips
irrelevant
harness
soon
surrendered
to
skilled
fingers
no
great
evil
had
been
done
thanks
to
the
fine
temper
of
flavian
s
armour
the
few
gashes
washed
oiled
and
dressed
left
him
not
seriously
the
worse
for
the
night
s
tussle
wine
and
food
recovered
his
manhood
he
was
barbered
perfumed
dressed
and
turned
out
by
his
servants
a
very
handsome
fellow
with
a
fine
pallor
and
a
pathetic
limp
his
first
care
was
to
see
his
own
men
attended
to
the
wounded
properly
bestowed
a
good
supply
of
food
and
wine
dealt
out
he
had
a
brave
word
and
a
smile
for
all
as
he
passed
he
found
father
julian
the
priest
administering
the
host
to
those
whose
dim
eyes
were
closing
upon
earth
and

modred
that
iron
man
who
never
seemed
weary
was
stalking
the
battlements
and
getting
the
place
prepared
for
the
next
storm
that
should
break
flavian
renounced
responsibilities
for
the
moment
and
crossed
the
garden
to
yeoland
s
room
he
entered
quietly
looked
about
him
saw
a
figure
prostrate
on
the
cushions
of
the
window
seat
he
crossed
the
room
very
quickly
knelt
down
and
touched
the
girl
s
hair
her
face
was
hidden
in
the
cushions
she
turned
slowly
on
her
side
and
looked
at
him
with
a
wan
pitiful
stare
her
eyes
were
timid
but
empty
of
tears
ah
girl
what
troubles
you
she
did
not
look
at
him
though
he
held
her
hands
are
you
angry
with
me
no
no
what
is
it
then
she
spoke
very
slowly
in
a
suppressed
and
toneless
voice
will
you
tell
me
the
truth
he
watched
her
as
though
she
were
a
saint
i
have
had
a
horrible
thought
in
my
heart
and
it
has
wounded
me
to
death
tell
it
me
tell
it
me
that
you
had
repented
all
repented
of
all
the
ruin
i
am
bringing
upon
you
that
you
were
beginning
to
think
he
gave
a
deep
cry
you
believed
that
she
lay
back
on
the
cushions
with
a
great
sigh
flavian
had
his
arms
about
her
as
he
bent
over
her
till
their
lips
nearly
touched
how
could
you
fear
i
am
so
much
a
woman
yes
and
something
is
all
the
world
to
me
even
though
well
i
would
die
happy
he
understood
her
whole
heart
and
kissed
her
lips
little
woman
i
had
come
here
to
this
room
to
ask
you
one
thing
more
you
can
guess
it
ah
father
julian
she
drew
his
head
down
upon
her
shoulder
and
he
knelt
a
long
while
in
silence
with
her
bosom
rising
and
falling
under
his
cheek
i
am
happy
he
said
at
last
let
us
go
hand
in
hand
into
heaven
xxxv
so
with
colgran
and
his
rebels
beating
at
the
inner
gate
flavian
of
gambrevault
took
yeoland
to
wife
and
was
married
that
same
eve
by
father
julian
in
the
castle
chapel
there
was
pathetic
cynicism
in
the
service
celebrating
as
it
did
the
temporal
blending
of
two
bodies
who
bade
fair
by
their
destinies
to
return
speedily
to
dust
the
chant
might
have
served
as
a
requiem
or
a
dirge
for
the
fall
of
the
mighty
it
was
a
tragic
scene
a
solemn
ceremony
attended
by
men
in
plated
steel
by
frightened
women
and
sickly
children

the
procession

with

to
the

it
was

a

that

have
appealed
to
a
stoic
or
to
a
marius

death
is
as
wine
to
the

even
as

before

so
the

pinions
to
a
more
luminous
heroism
when
the
mortal
tragedy
of
life
nears
the
explicit
as
the
martyrs
exulted
in
their

as

on

the
golden
lilies

waved
into
luckless
florence

flavian

yeoland
his

took
to
their
hearts
a
true
bridal
beauty
when
the
door
was
closed
on
them
that
night
a
mysterious
cavern
a

down
as
from

beside

in

over

framing
her

at

xxxvi
a
week
had
passed
and
the
gambrevault
trumpets
blew
the
last
rally
her
drums
rumbled
on
the
battlements
of
the
keep
where
the
women
and
children
had
been
gathered
a
dumb
flock
huddled
together
like
sheep
in
a
pen
the
great
banner
flapped
above
their
heads
with
a
solemn
and
sinuous
benediction
the
sun
was
spreading
on
the
sea
a
golden
track
towards
the
west
and
the
shouts
of
the
besiegers
rose
from
the
courts
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
banqueting
hall
the
last
remnant
of
the
garrison
had
gathered
men
silent
and
grim
as
death
game
to
the
last
finger
they
handled
their
swords
and
waited
moving
restlessly
to
and
fro
like
caged
leopards
they
knew
what
was
to
come
and
hungered
to
have
it
over
and
done
with
it
was
the
waiting
that
made
them
curse
in
undertones
a
few
were
at
prayer
on
the
stone
steps
father
julian
stood
with
his
crucifix
at
the
top
of
the
stairway
and
began
to
chant
the
miserere
some
few
voices
followed
him
in
the
inner
court
colgran
s
men
surged
in
their
hundreds
like
an
impatient
sea
they
had
trampled
down
the
garden
overthrown
the
urns
and
statues
pulped
the
flowers
under
their
feet
on
the
outer
walls
archers
marked
every
window
of
the
keep
in
the
inner
court
cannoneers
were
training
the
gaping
muzzle
of
a
bombard
against
the
gate
a
sullen
and
perpetual
clamour
sounded
round
the
grey
walls
like
the
roar
of
breakers
about
a
headland
flavian
stood
on
the
dais
of
the
banqueting
hall
and
listened
to
the
voices
of
the
mob
without
yeoland
in
the
harness
fulviac
had
given
her
held
at
his
side
the
man
s
beaver
was
up
and
he
looked
pale
but
calm
and
resolute
as
a
greek
god
that
morning
his
own
armour
blazoned
with
the
gambrevault
arms
had
disappeared
from
his
a
suit
of
plain
black
harness
left
in
its
stead
no
amount
of
interrogation
no
command
had
been
able
to
wring
a
word
from
his
knights
or
esquires
so
he
wore
the
black
armour
now
perforce
and
prepared
to
fight
his
last
fight
like
a
gentleman
and
a
christian
yeoland
s
hand
rested
in
his
and
they
stood
side
by
side
like
two
children
looking
into
each
other
s
eyes
there
was
no
fear
on
the
girl
s
face
nothing
but
a
calm
resolve
to
be
worthy
of
the
hour
and
of
her
love
that
buoyed
her
like
a
martyr
the
man
s
glances
were
very
sad
and
she
knew
well
what
was
in
his
heart
when
he
looked
at
her
they
had
taken
their
vows
vows
that
bound
them
not
to
survive
each
other
are
you
afraid
little
wife
no
i
am
content
strange
that
we
should
come
to
this
my
heart
grieves
for
you
never
grieve
for
me
i
do
not
fear
the
unknown
we
shall
go
out
hand
in
hand
to
the
shore
of
that
eternal
sea
and
i
feel
no
wind
and
hear
no
moaning
of
the
bar
the
stars
are
above
us
eternity
no
mere
glittering
void
but
the
face
of
god
a
cannon
thundered
a
sudden
sullen
roar
followed
a
din
of
clashing
swords
the
noise
of
men
struggling
in
the
toils
they
have
broken
in
flavian
s
grasp
tightened
on
her
wrist
his
face
was
rigid
his
eyes
stern
be
strong
he
said
i
am
not
afraid
the
virgin
bless
you
the
uproar
increased
below
the
rebels
were
storming
the
stairway
they
came
up
and
up
like
a
rising
tide
in
the
mazes
of
a
cavern
a
wave
of
struggling
figures
surged
into
the
hall
men
cursing
stabbing
hewing
writhing
on
the
floor
a
tangle
of
humanity
flavian
s
knights
in
the
hall
ranged
themselves
to
hold
the
door
it
was
then
that
flavian
saw
his
own
state
armour
doing
duty
in
the
press
its
blazonings
marking
out
the
wearer
to
the
swords
of
colgran
s
men
it
was
godamar
flavian
s
esquire
who
had
stolen
his
lord
s
harness
and
now
fought
in
it
to
decoy
death
and
perhaps
save
his
master
the
mute
heroism
of
the
deed
drew
flavian
from
the
dais
i
would
speak
with
godamar
he
said
do
not
leave
me
ah
dear
heart
when
the
last
wave
gathers
i
shall
be
at
your
side
yeoland
with
her
poniard
bare
in
her
hand
stood
and
watched
the
tragic
despair
of
that
last
fight
the
struggling
press
of
figures
at
the
door
the
few
holding
for
a
while
a
mob
at
bay
her
eyes
followed
the
man
in
the
black
harness
she
saw
him
before
the
tossing
thicket
of
pikes
and
partisans
she
saw
his
sword
dealing
out
death
in
that
gehenna
of
blasphemy
and
blood
a
crash
of
shattered
glass
came
unheard
in
the
uproar
men
had
planted
ladders
against
the
wall
and
broken
in
by
the
oriel
one
after
another
they
sprang
down
into
the
hall
the
first
crept
round
by
the
wainscotting
climbed
the
dais
seized
yeoland
from
behind
and
held
her
fast
as
by
instinct
the
poniard
had
been
pointed
at
her
own
throat
the
thing
was
twisted
out
of
her
hand
and
tossed
away
along
the
floor
she
struggled
with
the
man
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
but
his
brute
strength
was
too
stiff
and
stark
for
her
even
above
the
moil
and
din
flavian
heard
her
cry
to
him
turned
sprang
back
to
be
met
by
the
men
who
had
entered
by
the
oriel
they
hemmed
him
round
and
hewed
at
him
as
he
charged
like
a
boar
at
bay
one
two
were
down
swords
rang
on
his
harness
a
fellow
dodged
in
from
behind
and
stabbed
at
him
under
the
arm
yeoland
saw
the
black
figure
reel
recover
itself
reel
again
as
a
partisan
crashed
through
his
vizor
his
sword
clattered
to
the
floor
so
colgran
s
men
cut
the
lord
flavian
down
in
the
sight
of
his
young
wife
the
scene
appeared
to
transfer
itself
to
an
infinite
distance
a
mist
came
before
the
girl
s
eyes
the
uproar
seemed
far
faint
and
unreal
she
tried
to
cry
out
but
no
voice
came
she
strove
to
move
but
her
limbs
seemed
as
stone
a
sound
like
the
surging
of
a
sea
sobbed
in
her
ears
and
she
had
a
confused
vision
of
men
being
hunted
down
and
stabbed
in
the
corners
of
the
hall
a
mob
of
beings
moved
before
her
cursing
cheering
brandishing
smoking
steel
she
felt
herself
lifted
from
her
feet
and
carried
in

in

and
had
camped

rest
in

meadows
without
the
crumbling
walls

had
halted
but
for
a
night
on
the
retreat
from

and
had
taken
a
brief
breath
in

and
sweat
of

up
in

temper

guards
lounged
on
the
benches
under
the
vines
his

drank
in

swore
and
argued
over
the
rough
tables
it
was
evening
when
colgran

vanguard
entered
the
town
by
the
western
gate
his
men
had
tramped
all
day
in
the
sun
and
were
parched
and
weary
none
the
less
they
stiffened
their
loins
and
footed
it
through
the
streets
with
a
veteran
swagger
to
show
their
mettle
fulviac
came
out
and
stood
in
the
wooden
gallery
of
the
inn
watching
them
defile
into
the
they
tossed
their
pikes
to
him
as
they
poured
by
and
called
on
him
by
name
fulviac
fulviac
he
was
glad
enough
of
their
coming
for
he
needed
men
and
the
rough
forest
levies
were
in
colgran
s
ranks
ten
thousand
pikes
and
brown
bills
to
bristle
up
against
the
king
s
squadrons
there
was
strength
in
the
glitter
and
the
rolling
dust
of
the
columns
yet
before
all
the
man
s
tawny
eyes
watched
for
a
red
banner
and
a
woman
in
armour
upon
a
white
horse
yeoland
wife
of
flavian
of
gambrevault
in
due
season
he
saw
her
a
pale
spiritless
woman
wan
and
haggard
thin
of
neck
and
dark
of
eye
the
bloom
seemed
to
have
fallen
from
her
as
from
the
crushed
petals
of
a
rose
the
red
banner
borne
by
a
man
upon
a
black
horse
danced
listlessly
upon
its
staff
she
rode
with
slack
bridle
looking
neither
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
but
into
the
vague
distance
as
into
the
night
of
the
past
around
her
tramped
colgran
s
pikemen
in
jerkins
of
leather
and
caps
of
steel
the
woman
moved
with
them
as
though
they
were
so
many
substanceless
ghosts
stalking
like
shadows
down
the
highway
of
death
her
face
was
bloodless
bleached
by
grievous
apathy
and
chill
pride
the
bronzed
faces
round
her
were
dim
and
unreal
a
mob
of
masks
void
of
life
and
meaning
sorrow
had
robed
her
in
silent
snow
the
present
was
no
more
propitious
to
her
than
a
winter
forest
howling
under
the
moon
before
the
hostelry
the
column
came
to
a
halt
with
grounded
pikes
the
woman
on
the
white
horse
stirred
from
her
stupor
looked
up
and
saw
fulviac
he
was
standing
with
slouched
shoulders
in
the
gallery
above
her
his
hands
gripping
the
wooden
rail
their
eyes
met
in
a
sudden
mesmeric
stare
that
brought
badges
of
red
to
the
girl
s
white
cheeks
there
was
the
look
upon
his
face
that
she
had
known
of
old
when
perilous
care
weighed
heavy
upon
his
stubborn
shoulders
his
eyes
bewildered
her
they
had
a
light
in
them
that
spoke
neither
of
anger
nor
reproach
yet
a
look
such
as
arthur
might
have
cast
upon
fallen
guinivere
they
took
her
from
her
horse
and
led
her
mute
and
passive
into
the
inn
up
a
winding
stair
she
was
brought
into
a
sombre
room
whose
latticed
casements
looked
towards
the
west
by
an
open
window
stood
fulviac
chin
on
chest
his
huge
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
colgran
in
dusky
harness
was
speaking
to
him
in
his
rough
incisive
jargon
the
woman
knew
that
the
words
concerned
her
heart
at
a
gesture
from
fulviac
the
cast
a
fierce
glance
at
her
and
retreated
the
man
did
not
move
from
the
window
but
stood
staring
in
morose
silence
at
the
reddening
west
hunched
shoulders
and
bowed
head
gave
a
certain
powerful
pathos
to
the
figure
statuesque
and
silent
against
the
crimson
curtain
of
the
sky
the
very
air
of
the
room
seemed
burdened
and
saturated
with
the
gloomy
melancholy
of
the
man
s
mood
war
with
its
thousand
horrors
furrowed
his
brow
and
bowed
his
great
shoulders
beneath
its
bloody
yoke
her
woman
s
instinct
told
her
that
he
was
lonely
for
the
soul
that
had
ministered
to
him
breathed
for
him
no
more
he
turned
on
her
suddenly
with
a
terse
greeting
that
startled
her
thoughts
like
doves
in
a
pine
wood
welcome
to
you
lady
of
gambrevault
there
was
a
bluff
bitterness
in
his
voice
that
forewarned
her
of
his
ample
wisdom
colgran
had
surrendered
her
heart
and
tragedy
in
one
to
fulviac
s
mercy
a
looming
cloud
of
passion
shadowed
the
man
s
face
making
him
seem
gaunt
and
rough
to
her
for
the
moment
she
remembered
him
standing
over
duessa
s
body
in
sforza
s
palace
at
gilderoy
life
had
too
little
promise
for
her
to
engender
fear
of
any
man
even
of
fulviac
at
his
worst
i
trust
madame
yeoland
that
you
are
merry
the
taunt
touched
her
yet
she
answered
him
listlessly
enough
do
what
you
will
scoff
if
it
pleases
you
fulviac
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
tossed
his
lion
s
mane
from
his
broad
forehead
it
is
a
grim
world
this
he
said
when
thrones
burn
should
we
seek
to
quench
them
with
our
tears
whose
was
the
fault
that
god
made
you
too
much
a
woman
red
heart
heart
of
the
rose
a
traitorous
comrade
art
thou
and
an
easy
foe
she
had
no
answer
on
her
lips
and
he
turned
and
paced
the
room
before
her
darting
swift
glances
into
her
face
so
they
killed
him
he
said
more
quietly
anon
poor
child
forget
him
it
was
the
fate
of
war
even
to
the
grave
he
took
the
love
i
might
never
wear
she
shuddered
and
hid
her
face
fulviac
have
pity
pity
this
is
a
judgment
god
help
my
soul
a
judgment
for
serving
my
own
heart
before
the
virgin
s
words
the
man
stopped
suddenly
in
his
stride
and
looked
at
her
as
though
her
words
had
touched
him
like
a
bolt
betwixt
the
jointings
of
his
harness
there
was
still
the
morose
frown
upon
his
face
the
half
closure
of
the
lids
over
the
tawny
eyes
he
gripped
his
chin
with
one
of
his
bony
hands
and
turned
his
great
beak
of
a
nose
upwards
with
a
gesture
of
since
the
damned
chicanery
of
chance
so
wills
it
he
said
i
will
confess
to
you
that
my
confession
may
ease
your
conscience
the
madonna
in
that
forest
chapel
was
framed
of
flesh
and
blood
fulviac
of
flesh
and
blood
my
innocent
tricked
out
to
work
my
holy
will
we
needed
a
saint
we
cleansers
of
christendom
ha
noble
justiciaries
that
we
are
well
well
the
virgin
served
us
and
tripped
back
to
a
warm
nest
at
gilderoy
reincarnated
by
high
heaven
yeoland
stood
motionless
in
the
shadows
of
the
room
like
one
striving
to
reason
amid
the
rush
of
many
thoughts
she
showed
no
wrath
at
her
betrayal
her
pale
soul
was
too
white
for
scarlet
passion
the
significance
of
life
had
vanished
in
a
void
of
gloom
she
stood
like
hero
striving
to
catch
her
lover
s
voice
above
the
moan
of
the
sea
fulviac
unbuckled
his
sword
and
threw
it
with
a
crash
upon
the
table
he
thrust
his
arms
above
his
head
stretched
his
strong
sinews
took
deep
breaths
into
his
knotted
throat
the
truth
is
out
he
said
to
her
come
madame
confess
to
me
in
turn
yeoland
faced
him
with
quivering
lips
and
a
tense
straining
of
her
fingers
what
have
i
to
tell
she
asked
nothing
save
that
i
loved
the
lord
flavian
and
that
he
is
dead
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
ah
you
are
avenged
she
said
you
have
crushed
my
heart
may
the
thought
comfort
you
her
parched
apathy
seemed
to
elapse
of
a
sudden
and
she
lost
her
calmness
in
an
outburst
of
passion
she
was
athirst
for
solitude
to
be
cloistered
from
the
rough
cavil
of
the
world
colour
glowed
upon
her
sunken
cheeks
as
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
the
man
with
a
piteous
vehemence
fulviac
girl
ah
for
god
s
love
end
now
this
mockery
take
this
armour
from
me
for
it
burns
my
bosom
let
me
go
that
i
may
hide
my
wounds
in
peace
peace
he
said
with
a
twinge
of
scorn
fulviac
can
you
not
pity
me
i
am
broken
and
bruised
men
stare
and
jeer
oh
my
god
only
to
be
out
of
sight
and
alone
the
man
stood
by
the
window
looking
out
into
the
sky
with
lowering
brows
the
west
burnt
red
above
the
from
the
street
came
the
noise
of
men
marching
do
not
kill
yourself
he
said
with
laconic
brevity
why
do
you
say
that
there
is
truth
in
the
suspicion
ah
what
is
life
to
me
we
christians
still
have
need
of
you
the
man
s
seeming
scorn
scourged
her
anguish
to
a
shrill
despair
the
hot
blood
swept
more
swiftly
through
her
worn
white
body
cursed
be
your
ambition
she
said
to
him
must
you
torture
me
before
the
world
perhaps
i
renounce
this
lying
part
as
you
will
madame
it
will
only
make
you
look
the
greater
fool
ah
you
are
brutal
he
turned
to
her
with
the
look
of
one
enduring
unuttered
anguish
in
the
spirit
his
strong
pride
throttled
passion
twisting
his
rough
face
into
tragic
ugliness
no
believe
it
not
he
said
i
desire
even
for
your
heart
s
sake
that
you
should
make
the
best
of
an
evil
fortune
learn
to
smile
again
pretend
to
a
zest
in
life
i
have
fathomed
hell
in
my
grim
years
and
my
words
are
true
time
loves
youth
and
recovers
its
sorrow
know
this
and
ponder
it
tis
better
to
play
the
hypocrite
than
to
suffer
the

to
chuckle
over

xxxviii
the
royal
host
had
massed
about
the
walls
of
lauretia
and
marched
southwards
to
surprise
fulviac
at
gore
half
the
chivalry
of
the
land
had
gathered
under
the
standard
of
the
king
sir
simon
of
imbrecour
had
come
in
from
the
west
with
ten
thousand
spears
and
five
thousand
bowmen
the
northerners
under
morolt
boasted
themselves
twoscore
thousand
men
and
there
were
the
loyal
levies
of
the
midland
provinces
to
march
under
the
golden
sun
upon
the
south
never
had
such
panoply
of
war
glittered
through
the
listening
woods
their
march
was
as
the
onrush
of
a
rippling
sea
the
noise
of
their
trumpets
as
the
cry
of
a
tempest
over
towering
trees
chivalry
golden
champion
of
beauty
had
much
to
avenge
much
to
expurgate
the
peasant
folk
had
plunged
the
land
into
ruin
and
red
war
castles
smoked
under
the
summer
sky
the
noble
dead
lay
unburied
in
the
high
places
of
pride
to
the
wolf
cry
of
the
people
there
could
be
no
answer
save
the
hiss
of
the
sword
before
the
high
altar
at
lauretia
the
king
had
sworn
on
relics
and
the
scriptures
to
deal
such
vengeance
as
should
leave
the
land
cowering
for
centuries
in
terror
of
his
name
southwards
from
gore
there
stretched
for
some
fifteen
leagues
the
province
of
la
belle
forÃªt
a
region
of
rich
valleys
and
romantic
woods
green
and
quiet
under
the
tranquil
sky
its
towns
were
mere
gardens
smothered
deep
in
flowers
full
of
cedars
and
fair
cypresses
its
people
were
simple
happy
and
devout
war
had
not
set
foot
there
for
two
generations
and
the
land
overflowed
with
the
good
things
of
life
its
vineyards
purpled
the
valleys
its
pastures
harboured
much
cattle
its
houses
were
filled
with
rich
furniture
and
silks
chests
laden
with
cloth
of
gold
caskets
of
gems
ambries
packed
with
silver
plate
the
good
folk
of
la
belle
forÃªt
had
held
aloof
from
the
revolt
and
content
in
their
opulence
they
had
no
fondness
for
anarchy
and
war
it
was
into
this
fair
province
that
fulviac
led
his
arms
on
the
march
south
for
gilderoy
and
the
great
forest
by
the
sea
belle
forÃªt
neutral
and
luxurious
was
spoil
for
the
spoiler
stuff
for
the
sword
plundering
marauding
burning
butchering
fulviac
s
rebels
poured
through
like
a
host
of
huns
strength
promised
licence
there
was
little
asceticism
in
the
cause
though
the
sacred
banner
flew
in
the
van
with
an
unction
that
was
truly
pharisaical
from
that
flood
of
war
the
provincials
fled
as
from
a
plague
it
was
fulviac
s
policy
to
devastate
the
land
to
hinder
the
march
of
the
royal
host
desolation
spread
like
winter
over
the
fields
fulviac
s
ravagers
left
ruin
and
despair
and
a
great
silence
to
mark
their
track
the
march
became
a
bloody
parable
before
three
days
had
passed
fulviac
had
taken
burning
faggots
upon
his
back
and
the
iron
collar
of
war
weighed
heavy
on
him
that
autumn
season
it
was
a
grim
moral
and
a
terrible
he
had
called
up
fiends
from
hell
and
their
antics
mocked
him
storm
as
he
would
even
his
strong
wrath
was
like
fire
licking
at
granite
death
taunted
him
and
murder
rode
as
a
witness
at
his
side
the
mob
of
mad
humanity
was
like
a
ravenous
sea
hungry
pitiless
and
insatiate
even
his
stout
heart
was
shocked
by
the
bestial
passions
war
had
roused
his
men
were
mutinous
to
all
restraint
fight
they
would
when
he
should
marshal
them
but
for
their
lusts
they
claimed
a
and
delirious
liberty
yeoland
the
saint
rode
on
her
white
horse
through
la
belle
forÃªt
like
a
pale
ghost
dazed
by
the
human
miseries
of
war
a
captive
she
had
surrendered
herself
to
fate
her
heart
was
as
a
wearied
by
long
buffetings
in
the
wind
there
was
no
desire
in
her
for
life
no
spark
of
passion
no
hope
save
for
the
sounding
of
a
convent
bell
she
imagined
calmly
the
face
of
death
her
grave
stretched
green
and
quiet
to
her
fancy
under
some
forest
tree
even
her
hebetude
of
soul
gave
way
at
last
before
the
horrors
of
that
bloody
march
she
saw
towns
smouldering
and
flames
licking
the
night
sky
heard
walls
crack
and
roofs
fall
with
a
roar
and
an
uprushing
of
fire
she
saw
the
peasant
folk
crouching
white
and
stupefied
about
their
ruined
homes
she
heard
the
cry
of
the
children
the
wailing
of
women
the
cracked
voices
of
old
men
cursing
fulviac
as
he
rode
by
she
saw
the
crops
burnt
in
the
fields
cattle
slaughtered
and
their
carcases
left
to
rot
in
the
sun
the
deeds
of
those
grim
days
moved
in
her
brain
with
a
vividness
that
never
abated
war
with
all
its
ruthlessness
its
devilry
its
riotous
horror
burnt
in
upon
her
soul
the
plash
of
blood
the
ruin
the
despair
appalled
her
till
she
yearned
and
hungered
for
the
end
life
seemed
to
have
become
a
hideous
purgatory
flaming
and
shrieking
under
the
stars
she
appealed
to
fulviac
with
the
vehemence
of
despair
the
man
was
obdurate
and
moody
burdened
by
the
knowledge
that
these
horrors
were
beyond
him
his
very
impotence
was
bitterness
itself
to
his
strong
spirit
in
the
silent
passion
of
his
shame
he
buckled
a
sullen
scorn
about
his
manhood
scoffed
and
mocked
when
the
woman
pleaded
he
was
like
a
titan
struggling
in
the
toils
of
fate
flinging
forth
scorn
to
mask
his
anguish
he
had
let
war
loose
upon
the
land
and
the
riot
mocked
him
like
a
turbulent
sea
one
noon
they
rode
together
through
a
town
that
had
closed
its
gates
to
them
and
had
been
taken
by
assault
on
the
hills
around
stood
the
solemn
woods
watching
in
silence
the
scene
beneath
corpses
stiffened
in
the
gutters
children
shrieked
in
burning
attics
by
the
cross
in
the
soldiers
were
staving
in
wine
casks
the
split
lees
mingling
with
the
blood
upon
the
cobbles
ruffians
rioted
in
the
streets
lust
and
violence
were
loose
like
wolves
fulviac
clattered
through
the
place
with
yeoland
and
his
guards
a
tower
of
steel
amid
the
reeking
ruins
he
looked
neither
to
the
right
hand
nor
the
left
but
rode
with
set
jaw
and
sullen
visage
for
the
southern
gate
and
the
green
quiet
of
the
fields
his
tawny
eyes
smouldered
under
his
casque
his
mouth
was
as
stone
stern
yet
sorrowful
he
spoke
never
a
word
as
though
his
thoughts
were
too
grim
for
the
girl
s
ears
yeoland
rode
at
his
side
in
silence
shivering
in
thought
at
the
scenes
that
had
passed
before
her
eyes
she
was
as
a
lily
whose
pure
petals
quailed
before
the
sprinkling
plash
of
blood
her
soul
was
of
too
delicate
a
texture
for
the
rude
blasts
of
war
she
turned
on
fulviac
anon
and
taunted
him
out
of
the
fulness
of
her
scorn
this
is
your
crusade
for
justice
she
said
to
him
ah
there
is
a
curse
upon
us
you
have
let
fiends
loose
he
did
not
retort
to
her
for
the
moment
but
rode
gazing
into
the
gilded
glories
of
the
woods
even
earth
s
peace
was
bitter
to
him
at
that
season
but
bitterer
far
was
the
woman
s
scorn
war
is
war
he
said
to
her
at
last
we
can
not
leave
the
king
fat
larders
and
all
this
butchery
this
ruin
blame
war
for
it
and
brutal
men
mark
you
he
said
to
her
with
some
deepening
of
his
voice
i
am
no
god
i
can
not
make
angels
of
devils
the
sea
has
risen
can
i
cork
it
in
a
bottle
or
tie
the
storm
wind
up
in
a
sack
give
me
my
due
i
am
human
not
a
she
understood
his
mood
and
pitied
him
in
measure
for
he
had
a
burden
on
his
soul
sufficient
for
a
hercules
his
men
were
half
mutinous
they
would
fight
for
him
but
he
could
not
stem
their
lusts
he
was
as
a
stout
ship
borne
upon
the
backs
of
riotous
waves
well
would
it
have
been
she
said
if
you
had
never
raised
this
storm
it
is
easy
to
be
wise
at
the
eleventh
hour
he
answered
her
can
you
not
stay
it
even
now
woman
can
i
stem
the
sea
the
blood
of
thousands
dyes
your
hands
he
twisted
in
the
saddle
as
though
her
words
gored
him
to
the
quick
his
face
twitched
his
eyes
glittered
my
god
keep
silence
fulviac
taunt
me
no
longer
have
i
not
half
hell
boiling
in
my
heart
thus
fulviac
and
his
rebels
passed
on
spoiling
towards
gilderoy
and
the
sea
where
sforza
lay
camped
with
forces
gathered
from
the
south
the
great
forest
beckoned
them
they
knew
its
trammels
and
hoped
for
strategies
therein
like
a
vast
web
of
gloom
it
proffered
harbour
to
the
wolves
of
war
for
they
feared
the
open
and
the
vengeful
onrush
of
the
royal
chivalry
meanwhile
the
armies
of
the
king
came
down
upon
belle
forÃªt
a
great
horde
of
steel
from
its
black
ashes
the
country
welcomed
them
with
the
dumb
lips
of
death
ruin
and
slaughter
appealed
them
on
the
march
the
smoke
of
war
ascended
to
their
nostrils
fierce
was
the
cry
for
vengeance
in
the
ranks
as
the
host
poured
on
like
a
golden
dawn
treading
on
the
dark
heels
of
night
xxxix
in
a
cave
whose
narrow
mouth
cut
a
rough
cameo
from
the
snow
and
azure
of
the
sky
a
man
lay
sleeping
upon
a
bed
of
heather
the
surge
of
the
sea
rose
from
the
bastions
of
the
cliff
where
foam
glittered
and
swirled
over
the
black
rocks
that
thrust
their
dripping
brows
above
the
tide
gulls
were
winging
over
the
waves
whose
green
crests
shone
brilliant
under
the
sun
on
a
distant
headland
bleak
and
sombre
the
towers
of
a
castle
broke
the
turquoise
crescent
of
the
heavens
in
one
corner
of
the
cave
a
feeble
fire
flickered
the
smoke
therefrom
curling
along
the
roof
to
vanish
in
a
thin
blue
plume
of
vapour
beside
the
bed
lay
a
pile
of
armour
with
a
broken
casque
like
a
cleft
skull
to
crown
it
dried
herbs
and
a
loaf
of
rye
bread
lay
on
a
flat
boulder
near
the
fire
the
figure
on
the
heather
was
covered
by
a
stained
yet
gorgeously
blazoned
surcoat
that
seemed
an
incongruous
quilt
for
such
a
couch
near
the
cave
s
entry
a
great
axe
glittered
on
the
floor
an
axe
whose
notched
edge
had
tested
the
metal
of
many
a
bassinet
down
a
rough
path
cut
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
scrambled
a
gaunt
figure
doubleted
in
soiled
scarlet
battered
shoes
on
feet
a
black
beard
bristling
on
the
stubborn
chin
a
red
cloth
was
bound
about
the
man
s
head
he
breathed
hard
as
he
clambered
down
the
cliff
as
though
winded
by
fast
running
sweat
stood
on
his
forehead
beneath
him
ran
the
sea
a
pit
of
foam
swirling
and
muttering
amid
the
rocks
he
reached
the
entry
of
the
cave
and
dived
therein
like
a
fox
into
an
earth
standing
by
the
bed
he
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
unconscious
figure
with
the
air
of
one
unwilling
to
wake
a
weary
comrade
from
his
sleep
at
last
he
went
down
on
his
knees
by
the
heather
and
touched
the
sleeping
man
s
cheek
with
the
gentle
gesture
of
a
woman
the
figure
stirred
at
the
touch
two
thin
hands
groped
over
the
green
and
azure
quilt
the
kneeling
man
gripped
them
in
his
great
brown
paws
and
held
them
fast
modred
the
voice
was
toneless
husky
and
without
spirit
sire
ah
these
waking
moments
it
had
been
better
if
you
had
let
me
rot
in
gambrevault
courage
sire
you
wake
to
a
better
fortune
there
is
new
life
in
your
voice
the
king
has
come
at
last
the
man
on
the
heather
raised
himself
upon
one
elbow
his
face
looked
grey
and
starved
in
the
half
gloom
of
the
cave
he
lifted
up
one
hand
with
a
gesture
of
joy
the
king
modred
of
the
black
beard
smiled
at
him
like
a
father
his
hands
trembled
as
he
put
the
man
back
gently
on
the
heather
and
smoothed
the
coverlet
lie
still
sire
ah
this
is
life
once
more
patience
patience
let
us
have
no
woman
s
moods
no
raptures
ha
i
am
a
tyrannous
dog
did
i
drag
you
for
dead
out
of
gambrevault
to
let
you
break
your
heart
over
richard
of
lauretia
lie
quiet
sire
you
have
no
strength
to
gamble
with
as
yet
the
man
on
the
heather
reached
out
again
for
modred
s
hand
the
rough
dog
should
have
been
born
a
woman
he
said
to
him
modred
laughed
there
is
a
great
heart
under
that
hairy
chest
of
yours
the
moist
mutterings
of
the
sea
came
up
to
them
from
the
rocky
shore
beneath
clouds
in
white
masses
pressed
athwart
the
arch
of
day
modred
seated
on
a
boulder
beside
the
bed
eyed
the
prostrate
figure
thereon
with
a
gaunt
and
tender
pity
he
was
a
stark
man
and
strenuous
yet
warm
of
heart
for
all
his
bull
s
strength
and
steely
sinew
youth
lay
at
his
feet
thin
and
impotent
a
white
willow
wand
quivering
beside
a
black
and
knotty
oak
modred
rose
up
and
stood
by
the
opening
of
the
cave
his
broad
shoulders
filling
the
entry
as
he
looked
out
over
the
sea
far
over
the
amethystine
waters
a
hundred
sails
glimmered
beyond
the
cliffs
of
gambrevault
the
sun
smote
on
gilded
prow
and
blazoned
bulwark
and
upon
a
thousand
streamers
tonguing
to
the
breeze
modred
stretched
out
his
great
arms
and
smiled
a
grim
shimmer
of
joy
over
his
ruffian
s
face
standing
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
he
began
to
speak
to
the
man
couched
in
the
inner
gloom
yonder
beyond
gambrevault
he
said
i
see
a
hundred
sails
treading
towards
us
over
the
sea
they
are
the
king
s
ships
god
cherish
them
their
bulwarks
gleam
in
the
sun
flavian
twisted
restlessly
amid
the
heather
a
grand
sight
old
friend
modred
stood
silent
fingering
his
chin
his
voice
broke
forth
again
with
a
bluff
exultation
that
seemed
to
echo
the
roar
of
the
waves
philip
that
is
well
more
ships
nay
sire
they
raise
the
royal
banner
on
the
keep
of
gambrevault
i
see
spears
shine
listen
to
the
shouting
the
king
s
men
hold
the
headland
this
time
the
voice
from
the
cave
was
less
eager
and
tinged
with
pain
modred
old
friend
i
lie
here
like
a
stone
while
the
trumpets
call
to
me
sire
say
not
so
ah
for
an
hour
s
youth
again
one
day
in
the
sun
one
moment
under
the
moon
sire
i
would
change
with
you
if

would
grant
it
me

you
old

i
would
not
grant
it
you
if

a
trumpet
cried
to
them
from
the
cliff
sudden
shrill
and
imperious
modred
leaning
against
the
rock
with
his
hand
over
his
eyes
started
from
the
cave
and
began
to
climb
the
path
he
muttered
and
swore
into
his
beard
as
he
ascended
queer
oaths
spasmodic
and
fantastic
his
black
eyes
were
hazy
for
the
moment
contemptuous
and
fervid
he
brushed
the
tears
away
with
a
great
brown
hand
on
the
green
downs
above
him
rolling
to
the
peerless
sky
he
saw
armour
gleam
and
banners
blush
a
fanfare
of
trumpets
rolled
over
the
sea
it
was
richard
the
king
modred
bent
at
the
royal
stirrup
and
kissed
the
jewelled
hand
above
him
a
keen
visage
looked
out
from
beneath
a
bassinet
it
was
the
face
of
a
soldier
and
a
tyrant
handsome
haughty
yet
opulently
gracious
the
red
lips
curled
under
the
black
tusks
of
the
long
moustache
the
big
jaw
was
a
promontory
of
marble
thrust
forth
imperiously
over
the
world
well
man
what
of
our
warden
modred
crossed
himself
pointed
to
the
cliff
muttered
a
few
words
into
the
king
s
ear
so
came
the
terse
response
that
was
an
evil
fortune
so
splendid
a
youth
a
bright
beam
of
chivalry
come
lead
me
to
him
the
royal
statue
of
steel
dismounted
and
stalked
down
with
knights
and
heralds
towards
the
cliff
leaning
upon
modred
s
shoulder
richard
of
the
iron
hand
trod
the
rough
path
leading
to
the
little
cave
he
bowed
his
golden
crown
at
the
entry
stooped
like
a
suppliant
stood
before
the
lord
flavian
s
bed
the
gloom
troubled
him
for
a
moment
anon
he
saw
the
recumbent
figure
on
the
heather
the
pile
of
harness
the
brown
loaf
and
the
meagre
fire
he
throned
himself
on
the
boulder
beside
the
bed
and
laid
a
white
hand
on
the
sick
man
s
shoulder
lie
still
he
said
as
flavian
turned
to
rise
my
lord
we
can
forego
ceremony
courtesy
is
the
golden
crown
of
power
forged
from
a
poet
s
song
and
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
the
royal
favour
donned
its
robe
of
red
that
day
proffered
its
gracious
signet
to
the
lips
of
praise
held
forth
the
sceptre
of
a
radiant
pity
even
the
iron
of
truth
becomes
as
silver
on
the
lips
of
kings
justice
herself
flatters
when
ranged
in
simple
white
before
a
royal
throne
my
lord
of
gambrevault
quoth
richard
of
the
iron
hand
be
it
known
to
you
that
your
stout
walls

saved
my
kingdom
you
held
the
barbican
of
loyalty
till

friends
rallied
to
the
country

have
you
sounded
your
clarions
in
the
gate
of
fame
my
lord
i
give
to
you
the
gratitude
of
a
king
flattery
strutted
in
the
cave
gathering
her
robes
with
jewelled
hand
gorgeous
as
an
eastern
queen
concerning
the
fate
of
a
certain
rebel

the
royal

waxed
patriarchal
in
laconic
phrases

my
lord
the
boon
is
yours

queening
it
beside
me
on
my
throne
flinging
the
beams
of
her
bright
eyes
through
all
my
life

be
heralded
to

i
will
offer
gold
for

this
ring
from
me
no
pledge
as
betwixt

but
as
a
talisman
of
good
to
come
so
spoke
the
royal
gratitude
when
the
king
had
gone
modred
returned
to
carry
his
lord
heavenwards
to
the
meadows
he
found
him
prone
upon
the
heather
covering
his
eyes
with
his
thin
hands
as
the
western
sunlight
streaked
the
gloom
sire
said
modred
kneeling
down
beside

on

itself

reached

the
pity
of
it
to
lie
here
like
a
log
when
swords

and
peril
threatens
her
sire
we
shall
win
her
back
again
my
god
only
to
touch
her

once
more
to

bosom
and
the

he
sprang
up
thrust
out
his
arms
till
the
sinews
cracked
filled
his
great
chest
with
the
breath
of
the
sea
suddenly
he
stopped
strained
at
a
rock
lying
at
the
cave
s
mouth
lifted
it
and
hurled
it
from
him
saw
it
smite
foam
from
the
water
beneath

my
gauge
he
cried
with
a
fierce
glorying
in
his
strength
come

put
your
hands
about
my
neck
i
will
bear
you
to
your
castle
of
gambrevault
xl
fulviac
and
his
rebels
had
plunged
into
the
great
pine
forest
for
refuge
from
the
multitudinous
glitter
of
the
royal
spears
the
wilderness
engulfed
them
throwing
wide
its
sable
gates
to
take
the
war
wolves
in
the
trees
moaned
like
tall
sibyls
burdened
with
prophetic
woe
the
gold
had
long
fallen
from
the
gorse
the
heather
s
purple
hills
were
dim
mystery
abode
there
a
sound
as
of
tragedy
rose
with
the
hoarse
piping
of
the
autumn
wind
from
the
north
and
from
the
west
the
royal
arms
had
drawn
as
a
glittering
net
towards
the
sea
of
pines
a
myriad
splendid
warriors
streaked
the
wilds
like
rich
rods
flowering
at
some
magic
trumpet
cry
the
king
s
host
swept
the
hills
their
banners
blazing
towards
the
solemn
woods
gambrevault
was
theirs
and
avalon
of
the
mere
morolt
s
northerners
had
marched
upon
geraint
to
find
it
a
dead
city
empty
of
life
and
of
human
sound
only
gilderoy
stood
out
for
fulviac
the
king
had
failed
to
leaguer
it
as
yet
for
reasons
cherished
in
his
cunning
brain
some
twoscore
thousand
men
had
marched
with
fulviac
into
the
forest
s
sanctuary
over
the
hills
the
royal
horse
had
pressed
them
hard
cutting
down
stragglers
hanging
on
their
rear
fulviac
s
host
was
a
horde
of
foot
he
had
not
a
thousand
riders
to
hurl
against
the
chivalry
of
the
king
on
the
bold
bleak
uplands
of
the
north
and
west
the
royal
horsemen
would
have
whelmed
him
like
a
sea
necessity
turned
strategist
at
that
hour
fulviac
and
his
rebels
poured
with
their
stagnant
columns
into
the
wilds
the
thickets
teemed
with
steel
the
myriad
pike
points
glittered
like
silver
moths
through
the
dense
green
gloom
once
more
the
great
cliff
echoed
to
the
clangour
of
war
and
the
sword
fulviac
had
drawn
thither
and
camped
his
men
upon
the
heights
and
under
the
shadow
of
its
mighty
walls
smoked
on
the
hills
every
alley
had
its
sentinel
a
net
of
steel
thrown
forth
to
await
the
coming
of
the
king
fulviac
had
gathered
his
cubs
into
this
lair
trusting
to
trammel
the
nobles
in
the
labyrinths
of
the
forest
it
was
a
forlorn
hope
the
cunning
purpose
of
despair
the
spoilers
of
belle
forÃªt
were
wise
in
their
generation
little
mercy
would
they
win
from
the
iron
hand
of
richard
of
lauretia
like
a
pale
pearl
set
in
ebony
yeoland
the
saint
had
been
established
again
in
her
bower
of
stone
the
room
was
even
as
she
had
left
it
that
misty
summer
dawn
lute
and
crucifix
were
there
mute
relics
of
a
passionate
past
how
much
had
befallen
her
in
those
packed
weeks
of
peril
how
great
a
guerdon
of
woe
had
been
lavished
on
her
heart
love
was
as
the
last
streak
of
gold
in
a
fading
west
only
the
stars
recalled
the
unwavering
lamps
of
heaven
the
and
its
relics
tortured
her
very
soul
she
would
glance
at
the
sebastian
of
the
casement
and
remember
with
a
shuddering
rush
of
woe
the
man
in
whose
arms
she
had
slumbered
as
a
wife
death
had
deified
him
in
her
heart
she
remembered
his
grey
eyes
his
splendid
youth
his
passion
his
pure
chivalry
he
gazed
down
on
her
like
a
dream
hero
from
a
gloom
of
dusky
gold
the
bitter
ecstasy
of
the
past
spoke
to
her
only
of
the
infinite
beneficence
of
death
the
grave
yearned
for
her
and
she
had
no
hope
to
live
those
drear
days
she
saw
little
of
fulviac
the
man
seemed
to
shirk
her
pale
sad
face
and
brooding
eyes
her
grief
stung
him
more
fiercely
than
all
the
flames
nurtured
in
the
glowing
pit
of
war
moreover
he
was
cumbered
with
the
imminent
peril
of
his
cause
and
the
facing
of
a
stormy
fortune
his
one
hope
lay
in
some
great
battle
in
the
woods
where
the
king
s
mailed
chivalry
would
be
cumbered
by
the
trees
he
made
many
a
feint
to
tempt
the
nobles
to
this
wild
tussle
the
cliff
stood
as
adamant
a
vast
bulwark
to
uphold
the
rebels
yet
nature
threatened
him
with
other
arguments
his
stores
were
meagre
his
mouths
many
victory
and
starvation
dangled
upon
the
opposing
beams
of
fate
if
fulviac
feared
procrastination
richard
of
lauretia
favoured
the
same
wise
sluggard
that
he
was
he
curbed
the
vengeance
of
his
clamorous
soldiery
content
to
temporise
with
the
inevitable
trend
of
fortune
his
light
horse
scoured
the
country
garnering
food
and
forage
from
the
fat
lands
north
of
geraint
time
fought
for
him
and
the
starving
wolves
were
trapped
sufficient
was
it
that
he
held
his
crescent
of
steel
upon
the
hills
leaving
unguarded
the
barren
wilds
that
rolled
on
gilderoy
towards
the
east
a
week
passed
dull
and
lustreless
the
forest
waved
dark
and
solemn
under
the
autumn
sky
no
torrents
of
steel
gushed
from
its
sable
gates
no
glittering
squadrons
plunged
into
its
shadows
the
king

men
lay
warm
about
their
on
the
hills
fattening
on
good
food
tingling
for
the
trumpet

that
should
herald
the
advance
richard
of

smiled
and
passed
the
hours
at
chess
in
his
great
pavilion
pitched
on
the
slopes
towards

sullen
and
eerie
of
voice
the
black
wild
tossed
like
a
sombre
sea
over
hill
and
valley
its
spires
rocking
under
the
scurrying
sky
its
myriad
galleries
shrill
with
the
cry
of
the
wind
there
was
no
rest
there
no
breathless
silence
under
the
frail
moon
the
trees
moaned
like
a
vast
choir
wailing
the
downfall
of
a
god
the
wild
seemed
full
of
death
and
of
the
dead
as
though
the
souls
of
those
slaughtered
in
the
war
screamed
about
fulviac
s
lair
the
sentinels
grey
figures
in
a
sombre
atmosphere
watched
in
the
thickets
the
clarions
of
the
storm
might
mask
the
onrush
of
the
royal
chivalry
yeoland
the
saint
lay
full
length
upon
a
carved
settle
before
a
dying
fire
she
was
listening
to
the
wind
as
it
roared
over
the
cliff
amid
the
shrill
clamour
of
the
trees
it
was
such
an
eve
as
when
flavian
had
rattled
at
the
postern
to
offer
her
love
and
a
throne
at
avalon
she
had
spoken
of
war
and
war
had
sundered
them
given
death
to
desire
and
a
tomb
to
hope
the
glow
of
the
fire
played
upon
the
girl
s
face
and
shone
in
her
brooding
eyes
night
was
falling
and
the
gloom
increased
she
heard
footsteps
in
the
gallery
the
clangour
of
a
scabbard
against
the
rock
the
door
swung
back
and
fulviac
stood
in
the
entry
clad
in
full
harness
save
for
his
casque
there
were
deep
furrows
upon
his
forehead
his
lids
looked
heavy
from
lack
of
sleep
and
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
the
tinge
of
grey
in
his
tawny
hair
had
increased
to
a
web
of
silver
he
came
in
without
a
word
set
his
hands
on
the
back
of
the
settle
and
stared
at
the
fire
yeoland
had
started
up
she
sat
huddled
in
the
angle
looking
in
his
face
with
a
mute
surmise
fulviac
s
face
was
sorrowful
yet
strong
as
steel
the
lips
were
firm
the
eyes
sullen
and
sad
he
was
as
a
man
who
stared
ruin
betwixt
the
brows
nor
quailed
from
the
scrutiny
though
death
stood
ready
on
the
threshold
cloak
yourself
he
said
to
her
at
last
be
speedy
buckle
this
purse
to
your
girdle
she
sprang
up
as
the
leather
pouch
rattled
on
the
settle
and
stood
facing
fulviac
with
her
back
to
the
fire
whither
do
we
ride
i
send
you
under
escort
to
gilderoy
and
you
he
smiled
tightened
his
sword
belt
with
a
vicious
gesture
and
still
stared
at
the
hearth
my
lot
lies
here
he
said
to
her
i
meet
my
doom
alone
what
need
to
drag
you
deeper
into
the
dark
she
understood
him
on
the
instant
and
the
black
thoughts
moving
in
his
mind
disasters
thickened
about
the
cliff
perils
were
clamorous
as
the
trees
fulviac
feared
the
worst
she
knew
that
from
his
face
you
send
me
to
gilderoy
she
said
i
have
so
determined
it
and
why
need
you
doubt
my
discretion
the
flames
flashed
and
gleamed
upon
his
breastplate
and
deepened
the
shadows
upon
his
face
his
eyes
were
sorrowful
yet
full
of
a
strenuous
fire
the
sky
darkens
he
said
to
her
and
the
king
s
hosts
watch
the
forest
i
had
thought
to
draw
them
into
the
wilds
but
the
fox
of
lauretia
has
smelt
a
snare
our
stores
lessen
we
are
in
the
last
trench
she
moved
away
into
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
raised
the
carved
lid
of
a
chest
and
began
to
draw
clothes
therefrom
fingering
them
listlessly
as
though
her
thoughts
wavered
fulviac
leant
with
folded
arms
upon
the
settle
seemed
even
oblivious
of
her
presence
under
the
burden
of
his
fate
fulviac
she
said
at
last
glancing
at
him
over
a
drooping
shoulder
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
her
must
i
go
then
to
gilderoy
the
road
is
open
he
answered
with
no
obvious
kindling
of
his
sympathy
there
will
be
bloody
work
here
anon
you
will
be
safer
behind
stone
walls
and
the
king
she
asked
him
he
straightened
suddenly
like
a
man
tossing
some
great
burden
from
off
his
soul
ha
girl
are
you
blind
as
to
what
shall
follow
richard
of
the
iron
hand
waits
for
us
with
fivescore
thousand
men
we
shall
fight
by
god
yes
and
make
a
bloody
end
there
will
be
much
slaughter
and
work
for
the
sword
the
king
will
crush
us
as
a
falling
rock
crushes
a
scorpion
there
will
be
no
mercy
death
waits
put
on
that
cloak
of
thine
she
stood
motionless
a
moment
listening
to
the
moaning
of
the
wind
the
man
s
grim
spirit
troubled
her
she
remembered
that
he
had
bulwarked
her
in
her
homeless
days
had
dealt
her
much
pity
out
of
his
rugged
heart
he
was
alone
now
and
shadowed
by
death
thus
it
befell
that
she
cast
the
cloak
aside
upon
the
bed
and
stood
forward
with
quivering
lips
before
the
fire
fulviac
little
sister
ah
god
pardon
me
i
have
been
a
weak
and
graceless
friend
you
have
been
good
to
me
beyond
my
gratitude
the
past
has
gone
for
ever
what
is
left
to
me
now
shall
i
not
meet
death
at
your
side
he
stood
back
from
her
looking
in
her
eyes
breathing
hard
combating
his
own
heart
he
loved
the
girl
in
his
fierce
staunch
way
she
was
the
one
light
left
him
in
the
gathering
gloom
now
death
offered
him
her
soul
he
tottered
stretched
out
his
hands
to
her
snatched
them
back
with
a
great
burst
of
pride
no
this
can
not
be
ah
i
have
dared
the
storm
alone
will
i
fall
beneath
its
vengeance
you
shall
go
this
night
to
gilderoy
she
thrust
out
her
hands
to
him
but
he
turned
away
his
face
ah
little
sister
this
war
was
conceived
for
god
but
the
devil
leavened
it
i
have
gambled
with
fire
and
the
ashes
return
upon
my
head
i
give
you
life
tis
little
i
may
give
come
now
obey
me
these
are
my
last
words
she
turned
from
him
very
quietly
in
the
shadow
hiding
her
face
with
her
arm
picking
up
her
cloak
she
drew
it
slowly
about
her
shoulders
fulviac
watching
her
a
pillar
of
steel
they
wait
for
you
in
the
forest
he
said
go
down
the
stair
colgran
rides
with
you
to
gilderoy
he
is
to
be
trusted
she
drooped
her
head
staggered
to
the
door
darted
back
again
with
a
low
cry
and
a
gush
of
tears
fulviac
little
woman
god
keep
you
kiss
me
this
once
he
bent
to
her
touched
her
forehead
with
his
lips
thrust
her
again
towards
the
door
go
my
child
and
she
went
forth
slowly
from
him
weeping
into
the
night
xli
the
prophecies
of
the
king
proved
the
power
of
their
pinions
before
fourteen
suns
had
passed
over
the
black
wild
s
heart
richard
of
lauretia
had
plotted
to
starve
fulviac
into
giving
him
battle
or
into
a
retreat
from
the
forest
upon
gilderoy
the
royal
prognostications
were
pitiless
and
unflinching
as
candescent
steel
it
was
no
mere
that
he
sought
but
rather
an
amphitheatre
where
he
might
martyr
the
rebel
host
like
a
mob
of
revolted
slaves
whatever
tidings
may
have
muttered
on
the
breeze
riders
came
in
hotly
to
the
royal
pavilion
towards
the
noon
of
the
fourteenth
day
there
was
soon
much
stir
on
the
hills
hard
by
geraint
knights
and
nobles
thronged
the
royal
tent
captains
clanged
shoulders
gallopers
rode
south
and
west
with
fiery
despatches
to
morolt
and
sir
simon
of
imbrecour
battle
breathed
in
the
wind
before
night
came
the
king
s
pavilion
had
vanished
from
the
hills
his
columns
were
winding
round
the
northern
hem
of
the
forest
to
strike
the
road
that
ran
from
geraint
to
gilderoy
the
royal
scouts
and
rangers
had
not
played
their
master
false
a
river
of
steel
was
curling
through
the
black
depths
of
the
wild
threading
the
valleys
towards
the
east
the
king
s
scouts
had
caught
the
glimmer
of
armour
sifting
through
the
trees
they
had
slunk
about
the
rebel
host
for
days
while
they
lay
camped
in
their
thousands
about
the
cliff
colgran
and
his
small
company
had
passed
through
unheeded
but
they
were
up
like
hawks
when
the
whole
host
moved
that
midnight
fulviac
s
columns
rolled
from
the
outstanding
thickets
of
the
wild
and
held
in
serried
masses
for
the
road
to
gilderoy
the
king
s
procrastination
had
launched
them
on
this
last
desperate
venture
they
would
have
starved
in
the
forest
as
fulviac
had
foreseen
their
hopes
lay
in
reaching
gilderoy
which
was
well
victualled
throwing
themselves
therein
making
what
terms
they
could
or
die
fighting
behind
its
walls
thus
under
cover
of
night
they
slipped
from
the
forest
trusting
to
leave
the
king
s
men
guarding
an
empty
lair
the
brisk
forethought
of
richard
of
lauretia
had
the
rebels
however
in
the
hazardous
moves
of
war
they
were
answering
to
his
opening
like
wild
duck
paddling
towards
a
decoy
ten
miles
west
of
gilderoy
there
stretched
a
valley
walled
southwards
by
tall
heights
banded
through
the
centre
by
the
river
tamar
at
its
eastern
extremity
a
line
of
hills
rolled
down
to
touch
the
river
the
road
from
geraint
ran
through
the
valley
hugging
the
southern
bank
of
the
river
after
crossing
it
westwards
by
a
fortified
bridge
fulviac
and
his
host
would
follow
that
road
marching
betwixt
the
river
and
the
hills
it
was
in
this
valley
that
richard
of
lauretia
had
conceived
the
hurtling
climax
of
the
war
forewarned
in
season
sir
simon
of
imbrecour
and
his
bristling
squadrons
were
riding
through
the
night
on
gilderoy
shaping
a
crescent
course
towards
the
east
morolt
and
the
giants
of
the
north
were
striding
in
his
track
skirting
the
southern
spires
of
the
forest
to
press
level
with
the
rebel
march
screened
by
the
hills
the
king
and
his
lauretians
came
down
from
geraint
they
were
to
seize
the
bridge
across
the
tamar
pour
over
and
close
the
rebels
on
the
rear
it
was
near
dawn
when
fulviac
s
columns
struck
the
highroad
from
geraint
and
entered
the
valley
where
the
tamar
shimmered
towards
gilderoy
mist
covered
the
world
shot
through
with
the
gold
threads
of
the
dawn
the
river
gleamed
and
murmured
fitfully
in
the
meadows
the
southern
heights
glittered
in
the
growing
day
the
purple
slopes
of
the
black
wild
had
melted
dimly
into
the
west
the
mist
stood
dense
in
the
flats
where
the
geraint
road
bridged
the
river
the
northern
slopes
seemed
steeped
in
vapoury
desolation
the
road
winding
into
a
waste
of
green
fulviac
and
his
men
marched
on
chuckling
as
they
thought
of
the
royal
troops
watching
the
empty
alleys
of
the
forest
fulviac
took
no
care
to
secure
the
bridge
across
the
tamar
with
the
line
of
hills
before
them
breasted
they
would
see
the
spires
of
gilderoy
glittering
athwart
the
dawn
the
columns
were
well
in
the
lap
of
the
valley
before
two
light
horsemen
came
galloping
in
from
the
far
van
calling
on
fulviac
who
rode
under
the
red
banner
that
the
road
to
gilderoy
had
been
seized
fulviac
and
sforza
rode
forward
with
a
squadron
of
horse
to
reconnoitre
as
they
advanced
at
a
canter
the
mists
cleared
from
the
skirts
of
the
encircling
hills
far
to
the
east
on
the
green
slopes
that
rolled
towards
the
tamar
they
saw
the
sun
smite
upon
a
thousand
points
of
steel
pennons
danced
in
the
shimmering
atmosphere
shields
flickered
armour
shone
a
torrent
of
gems
seemed
poured
from
the
dawn
s
lap
upon
the
emerald
bosoms
of
the
hills
they
were
the
glittering
horsemen
of
sir
simon
of
imbrecour
who
had
ridden
out
of
the
night
and
seized
on
the
road
to
gilderoy
fulviac
halted
his
company
and
standing
in
the
stirrups
scanned
the
hillside
under
his
hand
he
frowned
thrust
forth
his
chin
turned
on
sforza
who
rode
at
his
side
trapped
he
said
with
a
twist
of
the
lip
dick
of
the
iron
hand
has
fooled
us
twas
done
cunningly
though
it
brings
us
to
a
parlous
passage
they
hold
the
road
the
gonfaloniere
tugged
at
his
ragged
beard
and
looked
white
under
the
arch
of
his
open
salade
better
advance
on
them
he
said
i
would
give
good
gold
to
be
safe
in
the
streets
of
gilderoy
fulviac
sneered
and
shook
his
head
there
are
ten
thousand
spears
on
yonder
slopes
the
lustiest
blood
in
the
land
count
their
banners
and
their
pennons
the
stuff
tells
an
honest
tale
pah
they
would
drive
our
rapscallions
into
the
river
send
back
and
bid
our
banners
halt
they
wheeled
and
cantered
towards
the
long
black
columns
plodding
through
the
meadows
far
to
the
west
over
the
green
plain
they
saw
spears
flash
against
the
sun
a
glimmering
tide
spreading
from
the
river
the
lauretians
had
crossed
the
bridge
and
were
hurrying
on
the
rebels
heels
fulviac
s
trumpets
sounded
the
halt
he
thundered
his
orders
to
his
captains
bade
them
mass
their
men
in
the
meadows
and
hedge
their
pikes
for
the
crash
of
battle
a
shout
reached
him
from
his
squadrons
of
horse
who
had
marched
on
the
southern
wing
they
were
pointing
to
the
heights
with
sword
and
spear
fulviac
reined
round
rode
forward
to
some
rising
ground
and
looked
southwards
under
his
hand
the
heights
bounding
the
valley
shone
with
steel
a
myriad
glistening
stars
shimmered
under
the
sun
morolt
s
northerners
had
shown
their
shields
the
hills
bristled
with
their
bills
and
spears
fulviac
shrugged
his
shoulders
lowered
his
beaver
and
rode
back
towards
his
men
he
saw
yeoland
the
saint
s
red
banner
waving
above
the
dusky
squares
he
remembered
the
girl
s
pale
face
and
the
hands
that
had
toyed
with
the
gilded
silks
in
the
dark
chamber
upon
the
cliff
though
the
sun
shone
and
the
earth
glistened
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
he
should
see
that
face
no
more
richard
of
lauretia
had
forged
his
crescent
of
steel
south
east
and
west
the
royal
trumpets
sounded
northwards
ran
the
tamar
closing
the
meadows
fulviac
and
his
men
were
trapped
in
the
green
valley
a
golden
girdle
of
chivalry
hemmed
the
mob
in
the
lap
of
the
emerald
meadows
all
about
them
blazed
the
panoply
of
war
fulviac
pessimist
that
he
was
took
to
his
heart
that
hour
the
lofty
tranquillity
of
a
scandinavian
hero
his
courage
was
of
that
stout
fibre
that
stiffened
its
beams
against
the
tide
of
defeat
he
set
forth
his
shield
tossed
up
his
sword
rode
through
the
ranks
with
the
spirit
of
a
roland
life
leapt
the
stronger
in
him
at
the
challenge
of
the
black
raven
of
death
his
captains
could
have
sworn
that
he
looked
for
victory
in
the
moil
so
bluff
and
strenuous
was
his
mood
that
day
sforza
came
cringing
to
him
and
haggard
to
speak
of
a
parley
fulviac
shook
his
shield
in
the
man
s
white
face
set
his
ruffians
to
dig
trenches
in
the
meadows
and
to
range
the
waggons
as
a
barricade
parley
forsooth
quoth
he

no
more
to
me
of
parleys
when

thousand
smiters

my
back

are
we
stuffed
with
hay
we
will
rattle
the
royal
bones
and
make
them
dance
a
fandango
to
the
devil
his
spirit
diffused
itself
through
the
ranks
of
the
rough
soldiery
they
cheered
wheresoever
he
went
kindling
their
courage
like
a
torch
and
tossed
their
pikes
to
him
with
strenuous
insolence
my
children
he
would
roar
to
them
as
he
passed
the
day

then
was
this
mortal
pillar
of

should
grudge
its

to

smoking
amid

he
had
torched
fame
through

he
pressed
the

steel
to

brandished
it
in

with

he
lay

darting

him
forward
that

as

man
born
to
claim
a
boon
upon
the
brink
of

fierce
and
virile
he
bared
his

lying
fallow

through

gleaming
under

bubbling
towards

outcry
the
wailing
of

mingling
with
the
hoarse
clamour
of

word
was
brought
to
the

by
one
of

that

were
holding

pouring
a

sealed
by

words
the

took
up
the
handiwork
of
the

a
gradual
glow
began
to
rise
above
the
smoke
billowed
up

and
voluminous
dusted
with
a

from

ran
like

roar

pit
the

in
with

before

were
carried
by

and
the
avengers
of

poured
pitiless
into

the
citizens

into

were

there
amid

gorgeous
gildings
of

a

swarming
in
the
frescoed

huddled
beneath
the
painted
figures
of
the
saints
the
glow
of
the
burning

beat
in
through
the
jewelled
glass

the

with

and

and
fought
under

of

despair
grappled
and
swayed
in

great
pit
of
death
the
blazing
streets
walled
in
a
red
inferno
where
passions
ran
like
satanic
wine
gilderoy
proud
city
of

quivered
and
expired
beneath
the
iron
gauntlet
of
the
king
modred
of
gambrevault
moved
through
the
press
with
morolt
of
the
north
fighting
at

side
they
had
a

quest
that
night
a
common
watchword
chastening
the
vengeance
of
their

seek
the

save
yeoland
of
gambrevault
it
was
as
a
hoarse
shout
feeble
and
futile
amid
the
bluster
of
a
storm
what
hope
was
there
for
this
madonna
amid
the
burning
wreck
of
gilderoy
she
was
as
a
lily
in
a
flaming
forest
modred
sought
for
her
with
voice
and
sword
thinking
of
flavian
and
the
vow
upon
the
cliff
though
the
city
lightened
black
modred
s
heart
was
steeped
in
gloom
death
and
despair
seemed
armed
against
his
hope
on
the
eastern
quarter
a
little
court
stood
back
from
the
great
square
a
fountain
played
in
the
centre
the
thrown
from
a
mermaid
s
bosom
sparkling
like
a
plume
of
gems
the
walls
of
the
court
were
streaked
with
flame
its
casements
tawny
with
yellow
light
the
breath
of
the
place
was
as
the
breath
of
a
furnace
a
quaking
crowd
filled
it
driven
to
bay
by
the
swords
shining
in
the
square
modred
was
a
tall
man
a
pine
standing
amid
hollies
staring
into
the
murk
of
the
court
wreathed
round
with
a
garland
of
fire
he
saw
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
a
woman
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
fountain
leaning
against
the
brim
of
the
basin
her
hair
blew
loose
from
under
her
open
bassinet
her
white
face
like
a
flower
was
turned
mutely
to
the
night
a
cuirass
glimmered
under
her
cloud
of
hair
modred
when
he
saw
her
sent
up
a
shout
like
that
of
a
wrecked
mariner
sighting
a
sail
over
tumbling
waves
he
tossed
his
sword
charged
forward
into
the
court
began
to
buffet
his
way
towards
the
figure
by
the
fountain
a
knot
of
soldiery
taking
his
shout
as
a
rallying
cry
stormed
after
him
into
the
court
there
was
a
great
crush
in
the
entry
men
tumbling
in
and
using
their
swords
as
poniards
the
townsfolk
were
scattered
like
blown
leaves
towards
the
burning
houses
in
the
hot
turmoil
of
the
moment
the
girl
was
swept
from
the
fountain
steps
and
carried
by
a
struggling
bunch
of
figures
towards
a
corner
of
the
court
modred
lost
sight
of
her
for
the
moment
as
he
ploughed
forward
through
the
press
flames
were
rushing
from
casement
and
from
roof
the
breath
of
the
place
was
as
the
breath
of
a
burning
desert
the
gilderoy
rebels
pent
in
the
court
were
being
put
to
the
sword
through
the
swirl
of
the
struggle
yeoland
s
bassinet
shone
out
again
modred
saw
her
standing
alone
shading
her
face
with
her
hands
like
some
wild
desperate
thing
knowing
not
whither
to
escape
he
pushed
on
calling
her
by
name
before
he
could
reach
her
the
gabled
front
of
a
house
undermined
by
the
fire
lurched
forward
tottered
and
came
down
with
a
roar
a
blazing
brand
struck
modred
on
the
helmet
he
staggered
beheld
a
shower
of
sparks
felt
a
scorching
wind
upon
his
face
the
stones
were
littered
with
crackling
woodwork
glowing
timber
reeking
tiles
he
was
stunned
for
a
moment
as
by
the
blow
of
a
mace
flames
were
leaping
heavenwards
from
the
houses
wiping
out
the
mild
faces
of
the
stars
with
their
ruthless
hands
with
a
great
cry
modred
had
started
forward
like
a
charging
bull
he
dragged
aside
the
smouldering
wreckage
of
gable
and
roof
tore
the
rafters
aside
nor
heeded
the
heat
for
his
harness
helped
him
his
great
body
quivered
as
he
drew
the
girl
out
and
lifted
her
from
the
stones
her
green
kirtle
was
alight
and
with
the
strong
instinct
of
the
moment
he
ran
with
her
to
the
fountain
and
plunged
her
bodily
in
the
broad
basin
panting
he
bore
her
across
the
great
square
in
his
arms
yeoland
was
making
a
little
moaning
whimper
but
for
all
else
lay
quiet
as
a
bird
modred
dared
not
look
into
her
face
the
scent
of
her
scorched
hair
beat
up
into
his
nostrils
he
ground
his
teeth
and
cursed
fate
as
he
ran
was
it
for
this
that
they
had
bulwarked

as

passed
the
crisp

swirled
and
fell
a
pall
for

amid

from

again
upon

from

descended
upon

a
silence
as
of

after
the
hideous
masque
of

and
thunder
had
passed
from

heard
again
the

weeks
had
gone
since

for

seneschal
in

he
had
cleansed
and
regarnished
the
castle
by
his
lord
s
command
and
garrisoned
it
with
men
taken
from
the
king
s
own
guard
moreover
in
gilderoy
he
had
found
an
old
man
groping
miserlike
amid
the
ruins
filthy
and
querulous
the
pantaloon
when
challenged
had
confessed
to
the
name
of
aurelius
and
the
profession
of
medicine
by
royal
patent
in
that
city
the
townsfolk
had
spared
his
pompous
neck
for
the
sake
of

of

fat
proud

had
cringed
into
a

caught
like
a
veritable
pearl
from

and
brought
with
other
household
perquisites
into
avalon
in
this
rich
refuge
aurelius
awoke
as
from
an
unsavoury
and
penurious
dream
he
regained
some
of
his
plump
sage
swagger
his
rotund
phraseology
his
autocratic
dogmatism
in
matters
Ã¦sculapian
the
atmosphere
of
avalon
agreed
with
his
gullet
above
all
things
he
was
held
to
be
a
man
of
tact
in
dead
duessa
s
bower
there
still
hung
her
mirror
of
steel
whose
sheeny
surface
had
often
answered
to

languorous
eyes

hair
had
glimmered
before
this
good
friend

flattery
gems
necklet
broideries
and
tiars
had
sunk
deep
into
its
magic
memory
the
mirror
could
have
told
truths
and
expounded
philosophies
had
there
been
some
merlin
to
conjure
with
the
past
aurelius
of
gilderoy
played
the
necromancer
under
more
rational
auspices
he
was
a
benignant
soul
subtle
sympathetic
to
the
brink
of
dotage
his
professional
hint
was
that
dead
duessa
s
mirror
should
be
exiled
from
the
bower
of
avalon
the
oracle
spoke
with
much
beneficence
as
to
the
delusions
of
the
sick
and
the
demoniac
influence
of
melancholy
upon
the
brain
yet
his
wisdom
was
withstood
in
the
very
quarter
where
he
had
trusted
to
find
obedience
and
understanding
dead
duessa
s
mirror
still
hung
in
the
lady
yeoland
s
bower
one
calm
evening
when
the
west
stood
a
great
arch
of
ruddy
gold
a
slim
girl
knelt
in
the
oriel
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
she
was
clad
in
a
gown
of
peacock
blue
fitting
close
to
her
slight
figure
and
girded
about
the
hips
with
a
girdle
of
green
leather
her
black
hair
poured
upon
her
shoulders
clouding
her
face
yet
leaving
bare
the
base
of
her
white
neck
where
it
curved
from
her
pearly
shoulders
she
drooped
her
head
as
she
knelt
before
the
casement
where
the
light
entered
to
her
azure
and
green
vermilion
and
purple
silver
and
rose
anon
she
rose
softly
turned
towards
the
mirror
hanging
on
the
wall
gazed
into
its
depths
with
a
species
of
bewitched
fear
one
glance
given
she
turned
away
with
a
shudder
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
walked
the
room
in
a
mute
frenzy
of
presently
she
knelt
again
before
the
struggled
in
prayer
turning
her
face
piteously
to
an
open
casement
where
the
golden
woods
stood
under
the
red
wand
of
the
west
the
light
waned
a
little
she
rose
up
again
from
her
knees
shook
her
hair
forward
so
that
it
bathed
her
face
trod
slowly
towards
the
mirror
stared
at
herself
therein
the
crystal
bowl
was
broken
the
ivory
throne
dishonoured
the
blush
of
the
rose
had
faded
the
gleam
of
the
opal
fallen
to
dust
youth
and
its
sapphire
shield
had
passed
into
the
gloom
of
dreams
the
stars
and
the
moon
were
magical
no
more
she
wavered
away
from
the
window
to
a
dark
corner
hid
her
face
in
the
arras
the
same
wild
cry
rang
like
a
piteous
requiem
through
her
brain
the
man
lived
and
loved
her
and
she
had
come
to
this
burning
gilderoy
had
stolen
her
beauty
made
her
a
mockery
of
her
very
self
god
that
fate
should
compel
her
to
lift
her
scars
to
the
eyes
of
love
in
the
gathering
dusk
she
went
again
to
the
mirror
peered
therein
with
strained
eyes
and
a
tremor
of
the
lip
the
twilight
softened
somewhat
the
bitterness
of
truth
she
shook
her
hair
forward
saw
her
eyes
gleam
fingered
her
white
throat
and
smiled
a
little
presently
she
lit
a
taper
held
it
with
wavering
hand
peered
at
the
steel
panel
once
again
she
cried
out
jerked
away
and
crushed
the
frail
light
under
her
foot
darkness
increased
seeming
to
clothe
her
misery
she
wandered
through
the
room
twisting
her
black
hair
about
her
wrist
moaning
and
darting
piteous
glances
into
the
gloom
once
she
took
a
poniard
from
a
table
fingered
the
point
pressed
her
hand
over
her
heart
threw
the
knife
away
with
a
gesture
of
despair
on
the
morrow
the
man
would
come
to
her
what
would
she
see
in
those
grey
eyes
of
his
horror
and
loathing
ah
god
not
that
anon
she
grew
calmer
and
less
distressed
prayed
awhile
lit
a
lamp
delved
in
an
ambry
built
in
the
wall
that
night
her
hands
worked
zealously
while
the
moon
shimmered
on
the
mere
setting
silver
wrinkles
on
its
agate
face
the
woods
were
still
and
solemn
as
death
deep
with
the
voiceless
sympathy
of
the
hour
black
lace
hung
upon
yeoland
s
hands
the
sable
thread
ran
through
and
through
her
white
fingers
quivered
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
her
few
hours
of
sleep
that
night
were
wild
and
feverish
smitten
through
with
piteous
dreams
on
the
morrow
she
bound
a
black
fillet
about
her
brows
and
let
the
dusky
mask
of
lace
fall
over
face
and
bosom
she
prayed
a
long
while
before
her
crucifix
but
she
did
not
gaze
again
into
dead
duessa
s
mirror
that
same
evening
modred
the
seneschal
blasphemed
aurelius
in
the
garden
of
avalon
the
man
of
the
sword
was
in
no
easy
humour
his
convictions
emerged
from
his
hairy
mouth
with
a
vigour
that
was
not
considerate

trumpets
were
blowing
in
avalon
of
the
twelve
towers
echoing
through
the
valley
where
the
sun
shone
upon
the
woods
the
sere
leaves
glittering
like
golden
byzants
as
they
fell
the
sky
was
a
clear
canopy
drawn
as
blue
silk
from
height
to
height
tenting
the
green
meadows
avalon

rose
black
and
strong
above
the
sheen
of
her
quiet
waters
from
gambrevault
came
the
lord
flavian
to
claim
his
wife
once
more
through
the
brief
days
of
autumn
aurelius
of
gilderoy
had
decreed
him
an
exile
from
the
isle
of
orchards
pleading
for
the
girl
s
frail
breath
and
her
lily
soul
that
might
fade
if
set
too
soon
in
the
noon
of
love
in
gambrevault
the
lord
flavian
had
moped
like
a
prisoned
falcon
listening
to
the
far
cry
of
the
war
hungry
for
the
touch
of
a
woman

snatched
the
madonna
of
the
pine
forest
from
burning
gilderoy
she
had
been
throned
at
last
above
the
tides
of
violence
and
wrong
that
day
the
lord
flavian
rode
in
state
for
avalon
even
as
an
arthurian
prince
coming
with
splendour
from
some
quest
the
woods
had
blazoned
their
banners
for
his
march
trumpets
hailed
him
from
the
towers
and
battlements
the
sun
like
a
great
patriarch
smoothed
his
gold
beard
and
beamed
upon
the
world
over
the
bridge
and
beneath
the
gate
modred

his
master

horse
the

had
gathered
in

central
court
they
tossed
their
swords
and
cheered
for

set
the
wild
woods
wailing
bombards
thundered
from
the
towers
in
the
court
amid
the
panoply
of

dismounted
took
modred

hand
leant
upon
the
great
man

well
ah

youth
turns
to
youth
let
my
minstrels
play
below
the
stair
some
old
song
of
tristan
and
iseult
and
now
i
go
to
her
lead
on
in
dead
duessa
s
bower
a
drooping
figure
knelt
before
a
crucifix
in
prayer
foreshadowings
of
misery
and
woe
were
stirring
in
the
woman
s
heart
she
had
heard
the
bray
of
trumpets
on
the
towers
the
thunder
of
cannon
the
shouts
of
strong
men
cheering
in
the
court
she
heard
lute
viol
and
flute
strike
up
from
afar
a
mournful
melody
sweet
with
an
antique
woe
time
seemed
to
crawl
like
a
wounded
snake
in
the
grass
the
figures
on
the
arras
gestured
and
grimaced
the
jewelled
glass
in
the
oriel
burnt
in
through
the
dark
lattice
of
her
veil
she
heard
footsteps
on
the
stairs
modred
s
deep
voice
joyous
and
strangely
tender
a
hand
fumbled
at
the
latch
starting
up
she
ran
towards
the
shadows
and
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
the
arras
the
door
had
closed
and
all
was
silent
yeoland
the
cry
smote
through
her
like
joy
barbed
with
bitterness
she
shuddered
and
caught
her
breath
swayed
as
she
stood
with
the
arras
hiding
her
face
wife
wife
with
sudden
strength
compelling
herself
she
peered
round
and
saw
a
figure
standing
in
the
shadow
a
man
with
white
face
turned
towards
the
light
his
hands
stretched
out
like
a
little
child
s
she
stood
motionless
breathing
fast
with
short
convulsive
breaths
her
lips
quivering
beneath
her
veil
i
am
here
she
said
to
him
husky
tremulous
and
faint
yeoland
ah
i
hear
your
voice
come
near
to
me
she
wavered
forward
three
steps
into
the
room
stood
staring
strangely
at
the
figure
by
the
door
yeoland
are
you
near
my
god
i
give
myself
to
you
a
broken
man
ah
where
are
your
hands
sudden
comprehension
seized
her
she
went
very
near
to
him
gazing
in
his
face
speak
wife
i
shall
never
see
the
sky
again
nor
watch
the
stars
at
night
nor
the
moon
nor
the
sea
i
shall
never
look
on
avalon
her
green
woods
and
her
lilies
and
her
sleeping
mere
i
shall
never
behold
your
face
again
i
am
blind
i
am
blind
she
gave
a
great
cry
tore
the
veil
from
her
face
and
cast
it
far
from
her
husband
i
come
to
you
his
hands
were
groping
in
the
dark
groping
like
souls
that
sought
the
light
she
went
near
him
weeping
caught
his
fingers
kissed
them
with
her
lips
the
man
s
arms
circled
her
she
hung
therein
and
buried
her
head
in
his
bosom
illustration
his
hands
were
groping
in
the
dark
my
love
my
own
i
am
blind
your
hair
bathes
my
face
ah
you
are
blind
mine
eyes
are
yours
and
i
your
wife
will
be
your
sun
no
more
pain
shall
compass
you
there
shall
be
no
more
grieving
no
more
tears
yeoland

in
heaven
i
give
thee
thanks
for
this
