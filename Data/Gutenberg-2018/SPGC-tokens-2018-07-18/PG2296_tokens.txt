rorlund
is
sitting
reading
aloud
from
a
book
with
gilt
edges
but
only
loud
enough
for
the
spectators
to
catch
a
word
now
and
then
out
in
the
garden
olaf
bernick
is
running
about
and
shooting
at
a
target
with
a
toy
crossbow
after
a
moment
aune
comes
in
quietly
through
the
door
on
the
right
there
is
a
slight
interruption
in
the
reading
bernick
nods
to
him
and
points
to
the
door
on
the
left
aune
goes
quietly
across
knocks
softly
at
the
door
of
bernick
room
and
after
a
moment
pause
knocks
again
krap
comes
out
of
the
room
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
some
papers
under
his
arm
krap
oh
it
was
you
knocking
aune
bernick
sent
for
me
krap
he
did
but
he
can
not
see
you
he
has
deputed
me
to
tell
you
aune
deputed
you
all
the
same
i
would
much
rather
krap
deputed
me
to
tell
you
what
he
wanted
to
say
to
you
you
must
give
up
these
saturday
lectures
of
yours
to
the
men
aune
indeed
i
supposed
i
might
use
my
own
time
krap
you
must
not
use
your
own
time
in
making
the
men
useless
in
working
hours
last
saturday
you
were
talking
to
them
of
the
harm
that
would
be
done
to
the
workmen
by
our
new
machines
and
the
new
working
methods
at
the
yard
what
makes
you
do
that
aune
i
do
it
for
the
good
of
the
community
krap
that
curious
because
bernick
says
it
is
disorganising
the
community
aune
my
community
is
not
bernick
krap
as
president
of
the
industrial
association
i
must
krap
you
are
first
and
foremost
president
of
shipbuilding
yard
and
before
everything
else
you
have
to
do
your
duty
to
the
community
known
as
the
firm
of
bernick
that
is
what
every
one
of
us
lives
for
well
now
you
know
what
bernick
had
to
say
to
you
aune
bernick
would
not
have
put
it
that
way
krap
but
i
know
well
enough
whom
i
have
to
thank
for
this
it
is
that
damned
american
boat
those
fellows
expect
to
get
work
done
here
the
way
they
are
accustomed
to
it
over
there
and
that
krap
yes
yes
but
i
ca
go
into
all
these
details
you
know
now
what
bernick
means
and
that
is
sufficient
be
so
good
as
to
go
back
to
the
yard
probably
you
are
needed
there
i
shall
be
down
myself
in
a
little
while
excuse
me
ladies
bows
to
the
ladies
and
goes
out
through
the
garden
and
down
the
street
aune
goes
quietly
out
to
the
right
rorlund
who
has
continued
his
reading
during
the
foregoing
conversation
which
has
been
carried
on
in
low
tones
has
now
come
to
the
end
of
the
book
and
shuts
it
with
a
bang
rorlund
there
my
dear
ladies
that
is
the
end
of
it
rummel
what
an
instructive
tale
holt
and
such
a
good
moral
bernick
a
book
like
that
really
gives
one
something
to
think
about
rorlund
quite
so
it
presents
a
salutary
contrast
to
what
unfortunately
meets
our
eyes
every
day
in
the
newspapers
and
magazines
look
at
the
gilded
and
painted
exterior
displayed
by
any
large
community
and
think
what
it
really
conceals
emptiness
and
rottenness
if
i
may
say
so
no
foundation
of
morality
beneath
it
in
a
word
these
large
communities
of
ours
are
whited
sepulchres
holt
how
true
how
true
rummel
and
for
an
example
of
it
we
need
look
no
farther
than
at
the
crew
of
the
american
ship
that
is
lying
here
just
now
rorlund
oh
i
would
rather
not
speak
of
such
offscourings
of
humanity
as
that
but
even
in
higher
circles
what
is
the
case
there
a
spirit
of
doubt
and
unrest
on
all
sides
minds
never
at
peace
and
instability
characterising
all
their
behaviour
look
how
completely
family
life
is
undermined
over
there
look
at
their
shameless
love
of
casting
doubt
on
even
the
most
serious
truths
dina
without
looking
up
from
her
work
but
are
there
not
many
big
things
done
there
too
rorlund
big
things
done
i
do
not
understand
holt
in
amazement
good
gracious
dina
rummel
in
the
same
breath
dina
how
can
you
rorlund
i
think
it
would
scarcely
be
a
good
thing
for
us
if
such
big
things
became
the
rule
here
no
indeed
we
ought
to
be
only
too
thankful
that
things
are
as
they
are
in
this
country
it
is
true
enough
that
tares
grow
up
amongst
our
wheat
here
too
alas
but
we
do
our
best
conscientiously
to
weed
them
out
as
well
as
we
are
able
the
important
thing
is
to
keep
society
pure
ladies
to
ward
off
all
the
hazardous
experiments
that
a
restless
age
seeks
to
force
upon
us
holt
and
there
are
more
than
enough
of
them
in
the
wind
unhappily
rummel
yes
you
know
last
year
we
only
by
a
hair
breadth
escaped
the
project
of
having
a
railway
here
bernick
ah
my
husband
prevented
that
rorlund
providence
bernick
you
may
be
certain
that
your
husband
was
the
instrument
of
a
higher
power
when
he
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
scheme
bernick
and
yet
they
said
such
horrible
things
about
him
in
the
newspapers
but
we
have
quite
forgotten
to
thank
you
rorlund
it
is
really
more
than
friendly
of
you
to
sacrifice
so
much
of
your
time
to
us
rorlund
not
at
all
this
is
holiday
time
and
bernick
yes
but
it
is
a
sacrifice
all
the
same
rorlund
rorlund
drawing
his
chair
nearer
do
speak
of
it
my
dear
lady
are
you
not
all
of
you
making
some
sacrifice
in
a
good
cause
and
that
willingly
and
gladly
these
poor
fallen
creatures
for
whose
rescue
we
are
working
may
be
compared
to
soldiers
wounded
on
the
field
of
battle
you
ladies
are
the
sisters
of
mercy
who
prepare
the
lint
for
these
stricken
ones
lay
the
bandages
softly
on
their
wounds
heal
them
and
cure
them
bernick
it
must
be
a
wonderful
gift
to
be
able
to
see
everything
in
such
a
beautiful
light
rorlund
a
good
deal
of
it
is
inborn
in
one
but
it
can
be
to
a
great
extent
acquired
too
all
that
is
needful
is
to
see
things
in
the
light
of
a
serious
mission
in
life
to
martha
what
do
you
say
miss
bernick
have
you
not
felt
as
if
you
were
standing
on
firmer
ground
since
you
gave
yourself
up
to
your
school
work
martha
i
really
do
not
know
what
to
say
there
are
times
when
i
am
in
the
schoolroom
down
there
that
i
wish
i
were
far
away
out
on
the
stormy
seas
rorlund
that
is
merely
temptation
dear
miss
bernick
you
ought
to
shut
the
doors
of
your
mind
upon
such
disturbing
guests
as
that
by
the
stormy
seas
for
of
course
you
do
not
intend
me
to
take
your
words
literally
you
mean
the
restless
tide
of
the
great
outer
world
where
so
many
are
shipwrecked
do
you
really
set
such
store
on
the
life
you
hear
rushing
by
outside
only
look
out
into
the
street
there
they
go
walking
about
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
perspiring
and
tumbling
about
over
their
little
affairs
no
we
undoubtedly
have
the
best
of
it
who
are
able
to
sit
here
in
the
cool
and
turn
our
backs
on
the
quarter
from
which
disturbance
comes
martha
yes
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
perfectly
right
rorlund
and
in
a
house
like
this
in
a
good
and
pure
home
where
family
life
shows
in
its
fairest
colours
where
peace
and
harmony
rule
to
bernick
what
are
you
listening
to
bernick
bernick
who
has
turned
towards
the
door
of
bernick
room
they
are
talking
very
loud
in
there
rorlund
is
there
anything
particular
going
on
bernick
i
do
know
i
can
hear
that
there
is
somebody
with
my
husband
hilmar
tonnesen
smoking
a
cigar
appears
in
the
doorway
on
the
right
but
stops
short
at
the
sight
of
the
company
of
ladies
hilmar
oh
excuse
me
turns
to
go
back
bernick
no
hilmar
come
along
in
you
are
not
disturbing
us
do
you
want
something
hilmar
no
i
only
wanted
to
look
in
here
good
morning
ladies
to
bernick
well
what
is
the
result
bernick
of
what
hilmar
karsten
has
summoned
a
meeting
you
know
bernick
has
he
what
about
hilmar
oh
it
is
this
railway
nonsense
over
again
rummel
is
it
possible
bernick
poor
karsten
is
he
to
have
more
annoyance
over
that
rorlund
but
how
do
you
explain
that
tonnesen
you
know
that
last
year
bernick
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
would
not
have
a
railway
here
hilmar
yes
that
is
what
i
thought
too
but
i
met
krap
his
confidential
clerk
and
he
told
me
that
the
railway
project
had
been
taken
up
again
and
that
bernick
was
in
consultation
with
three
of
our
local
capitalists
rummel
ah
i
was
right
in
thinking
i
heard
my
husband
voice
hilmar
of
course
rummel
is
in
it
and
so
are
sandstad
and
michael
vigeland
saint
michael
as
they
call
him
rorlund
ahem
hilmar
i
beg
your
pardon
rorlund
bernick
just
when
everything
was
so
nice
and
peaceful
hilmar
well
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
their
beginning
their
squabbling
again
it
will
be
a
little
diversion
any
way
rorlund
i
think
we
can
dispense
with
that
sort
of
diversion
hilmar
it
depends
how
you
are
constituted
certain
natures
feel
the
lust
of
battle
now
and
then
but
unfortunately
life
in
a
country
town
does
not
offer
much
in
that
way
and
it
is
given
to
every
one
to
turns
the
leaves
of
the
book
rorlund
has
been
reading
woman
as
the
handmaid
of
society
what
sort
of
drivel
is
this
bernick
my
dear
hilmar
you
must
not
say
that
you
certainly
have
not
read
the
book
hilmar
no
and
i
have
no
intention
of
reading
it
either
bernick
surely
you
are
not
feeling
quite
well
today
hilmar
no
i
am
not
bernick
perhaps
you
did
not
sleep
well
last
night
hilmar
no
i
slept
very
badly
i
went
for
a
walk
yesterday
evening
for
my
health
sake
and
i
finished
up
at
the
club
and
read
a
book
about
a
polar
expedition
there
is
something
bracing
in
following
the
adventures
of
men
who
are
battling
with
the
elements
rummel
but
it
does
not
appear
to
have
done
you
much
good
tonnesen
hilmar
no
it
certainly
did
not
i
lay
all
night
tossing
about
only
half
asleep
and
dreamt
that
i
was
being
chased
by
a
hideous
walrus
olaf
who
meanwhile
has
come
up
the
steps
from
the
garden
have
you
been
chased
by
a
walrus
uncle
hilmar
i
dreamt
it
you
duffer
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
still
playing
about
with
that
ridiculous
bow
why
do
you
get
hold
of
a
real
gun
olaf
i
should
like
to
but
hilmar
there
is
some
sense
in
a
thing
like
that
it
is
always
an
excitement
every
time
you
fire
it
off
olaf
and
then
i
could
shoot
bears
uncle
but
daddy
wo
let
me
bernick
you
really
must
put
such
ideas
into
his
head
hilmar
hilmar
hm
it
a
nice
breed
we
are
educating
up
it
we
talk
a
great
deal
about
manly
sports
goodness
knows
but
we
only
play
with
the
question
all
the
same
there
is
never
any
serious
inclination
for
the
bracing
discipline
that
lies
in
facing
danger
manfully
do
stand
pointing
your
crossbow
at
me
blockhead
it
might
go
off
olaf
no
uncle
there
is
no
arrow
in
it
hilmar
you
do
know
that
there
is
there
may
be
all
the
same
take
it
away
i
tell
you
why
on
earth
have
you
never
gone
over
to
america
on
one
of
your
father
ships
you
might
have
seen
a
buffalo
hunt
then
or
a
fight
with
red
indians
bernick
oh
hilmar
olaf
i
should
like
that
awfully
uncle
and
then
perhaps
i
might
meet
uncle
johan
and
aunt
lona
hilmar
hm
rubbish
bernick
you
can
go
down
into
the
garden
again
now
olaf
olaf
mother
may
i
go
out
into
the
street
too
bernick
yes
but
not
too
far
mind
olaf
runs
down
into
the
garden
and
out
through
the
gate
in
the
fence
rorlund
you
ought
not
to
put
such
fancies
into
the
child
head
tonnesen
hilmar
no
of
course
he
is
destined
to
be
a
miserable
like
so
many
others
rorlund
but
why
do
you
not
take
a
trip
over
there
yourself
hilmar
i
with
my
wretched
health
of
course
i
get
no
consideration
on
that
account
but
putting
that
out
of
the
question
you
forget
that
one
has
certain
obligations
to
perform
towards
the
community
of
which
one
forms
a
part
there
must
be
some
one
here
to
hold
aloft
the
banner
of
the
ugh
there
he
is
shouting
again
the
ladies
who
is
shouting
hilmar
i
am
sure
i
do
know
they
are
raising
their
voices
so
loud
in
there
that
it
gets
on
my
nerves
bernick
i
expect
it
is
my
husband
tonnesen
but
you
must
remember
he
is
so
accustomed
to
addressing
large
audiences
rorlund
i
should
not
call
the
others
either
hilmar
good
lord
no
not
on
any
question
that
touches
their
pockets
everything
here
ends
in
these
petty
material
considerations
ugh
bernick
anyway
that
is
a
better
state
of
things
than
it
used
to
be
when
everything
ended
in
mere
frivolity
lynge
things
really
used
to
be
as
bad
as
that
here
rummel
indeed
they
were
lynge
you
may
think
yourself
lucky
that
you
did
not
live
here
then
holt
yes

i
look
back

the
days
when

need
not
look
back
more
than
fourteen
or
fifteen
years

a
life
we
led
there
used
to
be
a
dancing
society

could
name
in

lynge
a
dreadful
scandal
about
tonnesen
rummel
good
heavens
no
tonnesen
is
her
cousin
of
course
lynge
i
am
speaking
of
her
brother
holt
the
wicked
tonnesen
rummel
his
name
was
johan
he
ran
away
to
america
holt
had
to
run
away
you
must
understand
lynge
then
it
is
he
the
scandal
is
about
rummel
yes
there
was
something
how
shall
i
put
it
there
was
something
of
some
kind
between
him
and
dina
mother
i
remember
it
all
as
if
it
were
yesterday
johan
tonnesen
was
in
old
office
then
karsten
bernick
had
just
come
back
from
paris
he
had
not
yet
become
engaged
lynge
yes
but
what
was
the
scandal
rummel
well
you
must
know
that
moller
company
were
acting
in
the
town
that
winter
holt
and
dorf
the
actor
and
his
wife
were
in
the
company
all
the
young
men
in
the
town
were
infatuated
with
her
rummel
yes
goodness
knows
how
they
could
think
her
pretty
well
dorf
came
home
late
one
evening
holt
quite
unexpectedly
rummel
and
found
his
no
really
it
is
a
thing
one
can
talk
about
holt
after
all
rummel
he
did
find
anything
because
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
rummel
yes
that
is
just
what
i
was
going
to
say
he
found
the
door
locked
and
just
think
of
it
the
man
that
was
in
the
house
had
to
jump
out
of
the
window
holt
right
down
from
an
attic
window
lynge
and
that
was
bernick
brother
rummel
yes
it
was
he
lynge
and
that
was
why
he
ran
away
to
america
holt
yes
he
had
to
run
away
you
may
be
sure
rummel
because
something
was
discovered
afterwards
that
was
nearly
as
bad
just
think
he
had
been
making
free
with
the
holt
but
you
know
no
one
was
certain
of
that
rummel
perhaps
there
was
no
truth
in
the
rumour
rummel
well
i
must
say
was
it
known
all
over
the
town
did
not
old
bernick
nearly
go
bankrupt
as
the
result
of
it
however
god
forbid
i
should
be
the
one
to
spread
such
reports
holt
well
anyway
dorf
did
get
the
money
because
she
lynge
yes
what
happened
to
dina
parents
afterwards
rummel
well
dorf
deserted
both
his
wife
and
his
child
but
madam
was
impudent
enough
to
stay
here
a
whole
year
of
course
she
had
not
the
face
to
appear
at
the
theatre
any
more
but
she
kept
herself
by
taking
in
washing
and
sewing
holt
and
then
she
tried
to
set
up
a
dancing
school
rummel
naturally
that
was
no
good
what
parents
would
trust
their
children
to
such
a
woman
but
it
did
not
last
very
long
the
fine
madam
was
not
accustomed
to
work
she
got
something
wrong
with
her
lungs
and
died
of
it
lynge
what
a
horrible
scandal
rummel
yes
you
can
imagine
how
hard
it
was
upon
the
bernicks
it
is
the
dark
spot
among
the
sunshine
of
their
good
fortune
as
rummel
once
put
it
so
never
speak
about
it
in
this
house
lynge
holt
and
for
heaven
sake
never
mention
the
stepsister
either
lynge
oh
so
bernick
has
a
too
rummel
had
luckily
for
the
relationship
between
them
is
all
over
now
she
was
an
extraordinary
person
too
would
you
believe
it
she
cut
her
hair
short
and
used
to
go
about
in
men
boots
in
bad
weather
holt
and
when
her
the
black
sheep
had
gone
away
and
the
whole
town
naturally
was
talking
about
him
what
do
you
think
she
did
she
went
out
to
america
to
him
rummel
yes
but
remember
the
scandal
she
caused
before
she
went
holt
holt
hush
do
speak
of
it
lynge
my
goodness
did
she
create
a
scandal
too
rummel
i
think
you
ought
to
hear
it
lynge
bernick
had
just
got
engaged
to
betty
tonnesen
and
the
two
of
them
went
arm
in
arm
into
her
aunt
room
to
tell
her
the
news
holt
the
tonnesens
parents
were
dead
you
know
rummel
when
suddenly
up
got
lona
hessel
from
her
chair
and
gave
our
refined
and
karsten
bernick
such
a
box
on
the
ear
that
his
head
swam
lynge
well
i
am
sure
i
never
holt
it
is
absolutely
true
rummel
and
then
she
packed
her
box
and
went
away
to
america
lynge
i
suppose
she
had
had
her
eye
on
him
for
herself
rummel
of
course
she
had
she
imagined
that
he
and
she
would
make
a
match
of
it
when
he
came
back
from
paris
holt
the
idea
of
her
thinking
such
a
thing
karsten
bernick
a
man
of
the
world
and
the
pink
of
courtesy
a
perfect
gentleman
the
darling
of
all
the
ladies
rummel
and
with
it
all
such
an
excellent
young
man
holt
so
moral
lynge
but
what
has
this
miss
hessel
made
of
herself
in
america
rummel
well
you
see
over
that
as
my
husband
once
put
it
has
been
drawn
a
veil
which
one
should
hesitate
to
lift
lynge
what
do
you
mean
rummel
she
no
longer
has
any
connection
with
the
family
as
you
may
suppose
but
this
much
the
whole
town
knows
that
she
has
sung
for
money
in
drinking
saloons
over
there
holt
and
has
given
lectures
in
public
rummel
and
has
published
some
mad
kind
of
book
lynge
you
do
say
so
rummel
yes
it
is
true
enough
that
lona
hessel
is
one
of
the
spots
on
the
sun
of
the
bernick
family
good
fortune
well
now
you
know
the
whole
story
lynge
i
am
sure
i
would
never
have
spoken
about
it
except
to
put
you
on
your
guard
lynge
oh
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
be
most
careful
but
that
poor
child
dina
dorf
i
am
truly
sorry
for
her
rummel
well
really
it
was
a
stroke
of
good
luck
for
her
think
what
it
would
have
meant
if
she
had
been
brought
up
by
such
parents
of
course
we
did
our
best
for
her
every
one
of
us
and
gave
her
all
the
good
advice
we
could
eventually
miss
bernick
got
her
taken
into
this
house
holt
but
she
has
always
been
a
difficult
child
to
deal
with
it
is
only
natural
with
all
the
bad
examples
she
had
had
before
her
a
girl
of
that
sort
is
not
like
one
of
our
own
one
must
be
lenient
with
her
rummel
hush
here
she
comes
in
a
louder
voice
yes
dina
is
really
a
clever
girl
oh
is
that
you
dina
we
are
just
putting
away
the
things
holt
how
delicious
your
coffee
smells
my
dear
dina
a
nice
cup
of
coffee
like
that
bernick
calling
in
from
the
verandah
will
you
come
out
here
meanwhile
martha
and
dina
have
helped
the
maid
to
bring
out
the
coffee
all
the
ladies
seat
themselves
on
the
verandah
and
talk
with
a
great
show
of
kindness
to
dina
in
a
few
moments
dina
comes
back
into
the
room
and
looks
for
her
sewing
bernick
from
the
coffee
table
dina
wo
you
dina
no
thank
you
sits
down
to
her
sewing
bernick
and
rorlund
exchange
a
few
words
a
moment
afterwards
he
comes
back
into
the
room
makes
a
pretext
for
going
up
to
the
table
and
begins
speaking
to
dina
in
low
tones
rorlund
dina
dina
yes
rorlund
why
do
you
want
to
sit
with
the
others
dina
when
i
came
in
with
the
coffee
i
could
see
from
the
strange
lady
face
that
they
had
been
talking
about
me
rorlund
but
did
you
not
see
as
well
how
agreeable
she
was
to
you
out
there
dina
that
is
just
what
i
will
not
stand
rorlund
you
are
very
dina
dina
yes
rorlund
but
why
dina
because
it
is
my
nature
rorlund
could
you
not
try
to
alter
your
nature
dina
no
rorlund
why
not
dina
looking
at
him
because
i
am
one
of
the
poor
fallen
creatures
you
know
rorlund
for
shame
dina
dina
so
was
my
mother
rorlund
who
has
spoken
to
you
about
such
things
dina
no
one
they
never
do
why
do
they
they
all
handle
me
in
such
a
gingerly
fashion
as
if
they
thought
i
should
go
to
pieces
if
they
oh
how
i
hate
all
this
rorlund
my
dear
dina
i
can
quite
understand
that
you
feel
repressed
here
but
dina
yes
if
only
i
could
get
right
away
from
here
i
could
make
my
own
way
quite
well
if
only
i
did
not
live
amongst
people
who
are
so
so
rorlund
so
what
dina
so
proper
and
so
moral
rorlund
oh
but
dina
you
do
mean
that
dina
you
know
quite
well
in
what
sense
i
mean
it
hilda
and
netta
come
here
every
day
to
be
exhibited
to
me
as
good
examples
i
can
never
be
so
beautifully
behaved
as
they
i
do
want
to
be
if
only
i
were
right
away
from
it
all
i
should
grow
to
be
worth
something
rorlund
but
you
are
worth
a
great
deal
dina
dear
dina
what
good
does
that
do
me
here
rorlund
get
right
away
you
say
do
you
mean
it
seriously
dina
i
would
not
stay
here
a
day
longer
if
it
were
not
for
you
rorlund
tell
me
dina
why
is
it
that
you
are
fond
of
being
with
me
dina
because
you
teach
me
so
much
that
is
beautiful
rorlund
beautiful
do
you
call
the
little
i
can
teach
you
beautiful
dina
yes
or
perhaps
to
be
accurate
it
is
not
that
you
teach
me
anything
but
when
i
listen
to
you
talking
i
see
beautiful
visions
rorlund
what
do
you
mean
exactly
when
you
call
a
thing
beautiful
dina
i
have
never
thought
it
out
rorlund
think
it
out
now
then
what
do
you
understand
by
a
beautiful
thing
dina
a
beautiful
thing
is
something
that
is
great
and
far
off
rorlund
hm
dina
i
am
so
deeply
concerned
about
you
my
dear
dina
only
that
rorlund
you
know
perfectly
well
that
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
i
can
say
dina
if
i
were
hilda
or
netta
you
would
not
be
afraid
to
let
people
see
it
rorlund
ah
dina
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
number
of
things
i
am
forced
to
take
into
consideration
when
it
is
a
man
lot
to
be
a
moral
pillar
of
the
community
he
lives
in
he
can
not
be
too
circumspect
if
only
i
could
be
certain
that
people
would
interpret
my
motives
properly
but
no
matter
for
that
you
must
and
shall
be
helped
to
raise
yourself
dina
is
it
a
bargain
between
us
that
when
i
come
when
circumstances
allow
me
to
come
to
you
and
say
here
is
my
hand
you
will
take
it
and
be
my
wife
will
you
promise
me
that
dina
dina
yes
rorlund
thank
you
thank
you
because
for
my
part
too
oh
dina
i
love
you
so
dearly
hush
some
one
is
coming
dina
for
my
sake
go
out
to
the
others
she
goes
out
to
the
coffee
table
at
the
same
moment
rummel
sandstad
and
vigeland
come
out
of
bernick
room
followed
by
bernick
who
has
a
bundle
of
papers
in
his
hand
bernick
well
then
the
matter
is
settled
vigeland
yes
i
hope
to
goodness
it
is
rummel
it
is
settled
bernick
a
norseman
word
stands
as
firm
as
the
rocks
on
dovrefjeld
you
know
bernick
and
no
one
must
falter
no
one
give
way
no
matter
what
opposition
we
meet
with
rummel
we
will
stand
or
fall
together
bernick
hilmar
coming
in
from
the
verandah
fall
if
i
may
ask
is
it
the
railway
scheme
that
is
going
to
fall
bernick
no
on
the
contrary
it
is
going
to
proceed
rummel
full
steam
tonnesen
hilmar
coming
nearer
really
rorlund
how
is
that
bernick
at
the
verandah
door
karsten
dear
what
is
it
that
bernick
my
dear
betty
how
can
it
interest
you
to
the
three
men
we
must
get
out
lists
of
subscribers
and
the
sooner
the
better
obviously
our
four
names
must
head
the
list
the
positions
we
occupy
in
the
community
makes
it
our
duty
to
make
ourselves
as
prominent
as
possible
in
the
affair
sandstad
obviously
bernick
rummel
the
thing
shall
go
through
bernick
i
swear
it
shall
bernick
oh
i
have
not
the
least
anticipation
of
failure
we
must
see
that
we
work
each
one
among
the
circle
of
his
own
acquaintances
and
if
we
can
point
to
the
fact
that
the
scheme
is
exciting
a
lively
interest
in
all
ranks
of
society
then
it
stands
to
reason
that
our
municipal
corporation
will
have
to
contribute
its
share
bernick
karsten
you
really
must
come
out
here
and
tell
us
bernick
my
dear
betty
it
is
an
affair
that
does
not
concern
ladies
at
all
hilmar
then
you
are
really
going
to
support
this
railway
scheme
after
all
bernick
yes
naturally
rorlund
but
last
year
bernick
bernick
last
year
it
was
quite
another
thing
at
that
time
it
was
a
question
of
a
line
along
the
coast
vigeland
which
would
have
been
quite
superfluous
rorlund
because
of
course
we
have
our
steamboat
service
sandstad
and
would
have
been
quite
unreasonably
costly
rummel
yes
and
would
have
absolutely
ruined
certain
important
interests
in
the
town
bernick
the
main
point
was
that
it
would
not
have
been
to
the
advantage
of
the
community
as
a
whole
that
is
why
i
opposed
it
with
the
result
that
the
inland
line
was
resolved
upon
hilmar
yes
but
surely
that
will
not
touch
the
towns
about
here
bernick
it
will
eventually
touch
our
town
my
dear
hilmar
because
we
are
going
to
build
a
branch
line
here
hilmar
aha
a
new
scheme
then
rummel
yes
is
it
a
capital
scheme
what
rorlund
hm
vigeland
there
is
no
denying
that
it
looks
as
though
providence
had
just
planned
the
configuration
of
the
country
to
suit
a
branch
line
rorlund
do
you
really
mean
it
vigeland
bernick
yes
i
must
confess
it
seems
to
me
as
if
it
had
been
the
hand
of
providence
that
caused
me
to
take
a
journey
on
business
this
spring
in
the
course
of
which
i
happened
to
traverse
a
valley
through
which
i
had
never
been
before
it
came
across
my
mind
like
a
flash
of
lightning
that
this
was
where
we
could
carry
a
branch
line
down
to
our
town
i
got
an
engineer
to
survey
the
neighbourhood
and
have
here
the
provisional
calculations
and
estimate
so
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
us
bernick
who
is
still
with
the
other
ladies
at
the
verandah
door
but
my
dear
karsten
to
think
that
you
should
have
kept
it
all
a
secret
from
us
bernick
ah
my
dear
betty
i
knew
you
would
not
have
been
able
to
grasp
the
exact
situation
besides
i
have
not
mentioned
it
to
a
living
soul
until
today
but
now
the
decisive
moment
has
come
and
we
must
work
openly
and
with
all
our
might
yes
even
if
i
have
to
risk
all
i
have
for
its
sake
i
mean
to
push
the
matter
through
rummel
and
we
will
back
you
up
bernick
you
may
rely
upon
that
rorlund
do
you
really
promise
us
so
much
then
from
this
undertaking
gentlemen
bernick
yes
undoubtedly
think
what
a
lever
it
will
be
to
raise
the
status
of
our
whole
community
just
think
of
the
immense
tracts
of
that
it
will
make
accessible
think
of
all
the
rich
deposits
of
minerals
we
shall
be
able
to
work
think
of
the
river
with
one
waterfall
above
another
think
of
the
possibilities
that
open
out
in
the
way
of
manufactories
rorlund
and
are
you
not
afraid
that
an
easier
intercourse
with
the
depravity
of
the
outer
world
bernick
no
you
may
make
your
mind
quite
easy
on
that
score
rorlund
our
little
hive
of
industry
rests
god
be
thanked
on
such
a
sound
moral
basis
we
have
all
of
us
helped
to
drain
it
if
i
may
use
the
expression
and
that
we
will
continue
to
do
each
in
his
degree
you
rorlund
will
continue
your
richly
blessed
activity
in
our
schools
and
our
homes
we
the
practical
men
of
business
will
be
the
support
of
the
community
by
extending
its
welfare
within
as
wide
a
radius
as
possible
and
our
women
yes
come
nearer
ladies
you
will
like
to
hear
it
our
women
i
say
our
wives
and
daughters
you
ladies
will
work
on
undisturbed
in
the
service
of
charity
and
moreover
will
be
a
help
and
a
comfort
to
your
nearest
and
dearest
as
my
dear
betty
and
martha
are
to
me
and
olaf
looks
around
him
where
is
olaf
today
bernick
oh
in
the
holidays
it
is
impossible
to
keep
him
at
home
bernick
i
have
no
doubt
he
is
down
at
the
shore
again
you
will
see
he
will
end
by
coming
to
some
harm
there
hilmar
bah
a
little
sport
with
the
forces
of
nature
rummel
your
family
affection
is
beautiful
bernick
bernick
well
the
family
is
the
kernel
of
society
a
good
home
honoured
and
trusty
friends
a
little
snug
family
circle
where
no
disturbing
elements
can
cast
their
shadow
krap
comes
in
from
the
right
bringing
letters
and
papers
krap
the
foreign
mail
bernick
and
a
telegram
from
new
york
bernick
taking
the
telegram
ah
from
the
owners
of
the
indian
girl
rummel
is
the
mail
in

must
excuse
me
vigeland
and
me
too
sandstad
good
day
bernick
bernick

day
good
day
gentlemen
and
remember
we
have
a
meeting
this
afternoon
at
five
the
three
men
yes
quite
so
of
course
they
go
out
to
the
right
bernick
who
has
read
the
telegram
this
is
thoroughly
american
absolutely
shocking
bernick
good
gracious
karsten

is
it
bernick

at
this
krap
read
it
krap
reading

the
least
repairs
possible
send
over
girl
as
soon
as
she
is
ready
to
sail
good
time
of
year
at
a
pinch
her
cargo
will
keep
her
afloat
well
i
must
say
rorlund
you
see
the
state
of
things
in
these
vaunted
great
communities
bernick
you
are
quite
right
not
a
moment
consideration
for
human
life
when
it
is
a
question
of
making
a
profit
to
krap
can
the
indian
girl
go
to
sea
in
four
or
five
days
krap
yes
if
vigeland
will
agree
to
our
stopping
work
on
the
palm
tree
meanwhile
bernick
hm
he
wo
well
be
so
good
as
to
look
through
the
letters
and
look
here
did
you
see
olaf
down
at
the
quay
krap
no
bernick
goes
into
bernick
room
bernick
looking
at
the
telegram
again
these
gentlemen
think
nothing
of
risking
eight
men
lives
hilmar
well
it
is
a
sailor
calling
to
brave
the
elements
it
must
be
a
fine
tonic
to
the
nerves
to
be
like
that
with
only
a
thin
plank
between
one
and
the
abyss
bernick
i
should
like
to
see
the
amongst
us
who
would
condescend
to
such
a
thing
there
is
not
one
that
would
do
it
not
a
single
one
sees
olaf
coming
up
to
the
house
ah
thank
heaven
here
he
is
safe
and
sound
olaf
with
a
in
his
hand
comes
running
up
the
garden
and
in
through
the
verandah
olaf
uncle
hilmar
i
have
been
down
and
seen
the
steamer
bernick
have
you
been
down
to
the
quay
again
olaf
no
i
have
only
been
out
in
a
boat
but
just
think
uncle
hilmar
a
whole
circus
company
has
come
on
shore
with
horses
and
animals
and
there
were
such
lots
of
passengers
rummel
no
are
we
really
to
have
a
circus
rorlund
we
i
certainly
have
no
desire
to
see
it
rummel
no
of
course
i
do
mean
we
but
dina
i
should
like
to
see
a
circus
very
much
olaf
so
should
hilmar
you
are
a
duffer
is
that
anything
to
see
mere
tricks
no
it
would
be
something
quite
different
to
see
the
gaucho
careering
over
the
pampas
on
his
snorting
mustang
but
heaven
help
us
in
these
wretched
little
towns
of
ours
olaf
pulling
at
martha
dress
look
aunt
martha
look
there
they
come
holt
good
lord
yes
here
they
come
lynge
ugh
what
horrid
people
a
number
of
passengers
and
a
whole
crowd
of
townsfolk
are
seen
coming
up
the
street
rummel
they
are
a
set
of
mountebanks
certainly
just
look
at
that
woman
in
the
grey
dress
holt
the
one
with
a
knapsack
over
her
shoulder
holt
yes
look
she
has
slung
it
on
the
handle
of
her
parasol
the
manager
wife
i
expect
rummel
and
there
is
the
manager
himself
no
doubt
he
looks
a
regular
pirate
do
look
at
him
hilda
holt
nor
you
netta
olaf
mother
the
manager
is
bowing
to
us
bernick
what
bernick

are
you
saying
child
rummel
yes
and
good
heavens
the
woman
is
bowing
to
us
too
bernick
that
is
a
little
too
cool
martha
exclaims
involuntarily
ah
bernick
what
is
it
martha
martha
nothing

i
thought
for
a
moment
olaf
shrieking
with
delight
look
look
there
are
the
rest
of
them
with
the
horses
and
animals
and
there
are
the
americans
too
all
the
sailors
from
the
indian
girl
the
strains
of
yankee
doodle
played
on
a
clarinet
and
a
drum
are
heard
hilmar
stopping
his
ears
ugh
ugh
ugh
rorlund
i
think
we
ought
to
withdraw
ourselves
from
sight
a
little
ladies
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
goings
on
let
us
go
to
our
work
again
bernick
do
you
think
we
had
better
draw
the
curtains
rorlund
yes
that
was
exactly
what
i
meant
the
ladies
resume
their
places
at
the
rorlund
shuts
the
verandah
door
and
draws
the
curtains
over
it
and
over
the
windows
so
that
the
room
becomes
half
dark
olaf
peeping
out
through
the
curtains
mother
the
manager
wife
is
standing
by
the
fountain
now
washing
her
face
bernick
what
in
the
middle
of
the
marketplace
rummel
and
in
broad
daylight
too
hilmar
well
i
must
say
if
i
were
travelling
across
a
desert
waste
and
found
myself
beside
a
well
i
am
sure
i
should
not
stop
to
think
whether
ugh
that
frightful
clarinet
rorlund
it
is
really
high
time
the
police
interfered
bernick
oh
no
we
must
not
be
too
hard
on
foreigners
of
course
these
folk
have
none
of
the
instincts
of
decency
which
restrain
us
within
proper
bounds
suppose
they
do
behave
outrageously
what
does
it
concern
us
fortunately
this
spirit
of
disorder
that
flies
in
the
face
of
all
that
is
customary
and
right
is
absolutely
a
stranger
to
our
community
if
i
may
say
so
what
is
this
lona
hessel
walks
briskly
in
from
the
door
on
the
right
the
ladies
in
low
frightened
tones

circus

undertone

scapegrace

tragical

sitting
here
in
the
gloom
sewing
white
things

a
death

day

the
worse
for

a
joyful
occasion
like
this
rorlund
a
is
not
always
a
joyful
occasion
lona
indeed
how
do
you
read
your
bible

rorlund
i
am
not
a
parson
lona
oh
you
will
grow
into
one
then
but
faugh
this
moral
linen

tainted
just
like
a
i
am
accustomed
to
the
air
of
the
prairies
let
me
tell
you
bernick
wiping
his
forehead
yes

rather
close

the
hotel

on
the
boat

got
piggishly
dirty
hilmar
ugh
ugh
lona
ugh
why

points
at
hildar
and
asks
the
others
is
he
still
loafing
about
here
saying
ugh
hilmar
i
do
not
loaf
it
is
the
state
of
my
health
that
keeps
me
here
rorlund

do
not
think
lona
who
has
noticed
olaf
is

paw
my
boy
or
are
you
afraid
of
your
ugly
old
aunt
rorlund
putting
his
book
under
his
arm
ladies
i
do
not
think
any
of
us
is
in
the
mood
for
any
more
work
today
i
suppose
we
are
to
meet
again
tomorrow
lona
while
the
others
are
getting
up
and
taking
their
leave
yes
let
us
i
shall
be
on
the
spot
rorlund
you
pardon
me
miss
hessel
but
what
do
you
propose
to
do
in
our
society
lona
i
will
let
some
fresh
air
into
it
parson
act
ii
the
same
room
bernick
is
sitting
alone
at
the
sewing
bernick
comes
in
from
the
right
wearing
his
hat
and
gloves
and
carrying
a
stick
bernick
home
already
karsten
bernick
yes
i
have
made
an
appointment
with
a
man
bernick
with
a
sigh
oh
yes
i
suppose
johan
is
coming
up
here
again
bernick
with
a
man
i
said
lays
down
his
hat
what
has
become
of
all
the
ladies
today
bernick
rummel
and
hilda
had
time
to
come
bernick
oh
did
they
send
any
excuse
bernick
yes
they
had
so
much
to
do
at
home
bernick
naturally
and
of
course
the
others
are
not
coming
either
bernick
no
something
has
prevented
them
today
too
bernick
i
could
have
told
you
that
beforehand
where
is
olaf
bernick
i
let
him
go
out
a
little
with
dina
bernick
hm
she
is
a
giddy
little
baggage
did
you
see
how
she
at
once
started
making
a
fuss
of
johan
yesterday
bernick
but
my
dear
karsten
you
know
dina
knows
nothing
whatever
of
bernick
no
but
in
any
case
johan
ought
to
have
had
sufficient
tact
not
to
pay
her
any
attention
i
saw
quite
well
from
his
face
what
vigeland
thought
of
it
bernick
laying
her
sewing
down
on
her
lap
karsten
can
you
imagine
what
his
objective
is
in
coming
here
bernick
well
i
know
he
has
a
farm
over
there
and
i
fancy
he
is
not
doing
particularly
well
with
it
she
called
attention
yesterday
to
the
fact
that
they
were
obliged
to
travel
second
class
bernick
yes
i
am
afraid
it
must
be
something
of
that
sort
but
to
think
of
her
coming
with
him
she
after
the
deadly
insult
she
offered
you
bernick
oh
do
think
about
that
ancient
history
bernick
how
can
i
help
thinking
of
it
just
now
after
all
he
is
my
brother
still
it
is
not
on
his
account
that
i
am
distressed
but
because
of
all
the
unpleasantness
it
would
mean
for
you
karsten
i
am
so
dreadfully
afraid
bernick
afraid
of
what
bernick
is
it
possible
that
they
may
send
him

prison
for
stealing
that
money
from
your
mother
bernick
what
rubbish
who
can
prove
that
the
money
was
stolen
bernick

whole
town
knows
it
unfortunately
and
you
know
you
said
yourself
bernick
i
said
nothing
the
town
knows
nothing
whatever
about
the
affair
the
whole
thing
was
no
more
than
idle
rumour

magnanimous
you
are
karsten
bernick
do
not
let
us
have
any
more
of
these
reminiscences
please

know
how
you
torture
me
by
raking
all
that
up
walks
up
and
down
then
flings
his
stick
away
from
him
and
to
think
of
their
coming
home
now
just
now
when
it
is
particularly
necessary
for
me
that
i
should
stand
well
in
every
respect
with
the
town
and
with
the
press
our
newspaper
men
will
be
sending
paragraphs
to
the
papers
in
the
other
towns
about
here
whether
i
receive
them
well
or
whether
i
receive
them
ill
it
will
all
be
discussed
and
talked
over
they
will
rake
up
all
those
old
stories
as
you
do
in
a
community
like
ours
throws
his
gloves
down
on
the
table
and
i
have
not
a
soul
here
to
whom
i
can
talk
about
it
and
to
whom
i
can
go
for
support
bernick
no
one
at
all
karsten
bernick
no
who
is
there
and
to
have
them
on
my
shoulders
just
at
this
moment
without
a
doubt
they
will
create
a
scandal
in
some
way
or
another
she
in
particular
it
is
simply
a
calamity
to
be
connected
with
such
folk
in
any
way
bernick
well

ca
help
their
bernick
what
ca
you
help

did
not
ask
them
to
come

the
hair
of
their
heads

whole
rigmarole
by
heart
bernick

into
tears
you
need
not
be
so
unkind

cry
so

our
neighbours

have
that
to
gossip
about

being
so
foolish
betty
go
and
sit
outside

here

do
suppose
you
want
people
to
see
the
lady
of
the
house
with
red
eyes
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
would
it
if
the
story
got
out
about
that
there
i
hear
some
one
in
the
passage
a
knock
is
heard
at
the
door
come
in
bernick
takes
her
sewing
and
goes
out
down
the
garden
steps
aune
comes
in
from
the
right
aune
good
morning
bernick
bernick
good
morning
well
i
suppose
you
can
guess
what
i
want
you
for
aune
krap
told
me
yesterday
that
you
were
not
pleased
with
bernick
i
am
displeased
with
the
whole
management
of
the
yard
aune
the
work
does
not
get
on
as
quickly
as
it
ought
the
palm
tree
ought
to
have
been
under
sail
long
ago
vigeland
comes
here
every
day
to
complain
about
it
he
is
a
difficult
man
to
have
with
one
as
part
owner
aune
the
palm
tree
can
go
to
sea
the
day
after
tomorrow
bernick
at
last
but
what
about
the
american
ship
the
indian
girl
which
has
been
laid
up
here
for
five
weeks
and
aune
the
american
ship
i
understood
that
before
everything
else
we
were
to
work
our
hardest
to
get
your
own
ship
ready
bernick
i
gave
you
no
reason
to
think
so
you
ought
to
have
pushed
on
as
fast
as
possible
with
the
work
on
the
american
ship
also
but
you
have
not
aune
her
bottom
is
completely
rotten
bernick
the
more
we
patch
it
the
worse
it
gets
bernick
that
is
not
the
reason
krap
has
told
me
the
whole
truth
you
do
not
understand
how
to
work
the
new
machines
i
have
provided
or
rather
you
will
not
try
to
work
them
aune
bernick
i
am
well
on
in
the
fifties
and
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
i
have
been
accustomed
to
the
old
way
of
working
bernick
we
can
not
work
that
way
you
must
not
imagine
aune
that
it
is
for
the
sake
of
making
profit
i
do
not
need
that
fortunately
but
i
owe
consideration
to
the
community
i
live
in
and
to
the
business
i
am
at
the
head
of
i
must
take
the
lead
in
progress
or
there
would
never
be
any
aune
i
welcome
progress
too
bernick
bernick
yes
for
your
own
limited
circle
for
the
working
class
oh
i
know
what
a
busy
agitator
you
are
you
make
speeches
you
stir
people
up
but
when
some
concrete
instance
of
progress
presents
itself
as
now
in
the
case
of
our
machines
you
do
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
you
are
afraid
aune
yes
i
really
am
afraid
bernick
i
am
afraid
for
the
number
of
men
who
will
have
the
bread
taken
out
of
their
mouths
by
these
machines
you
are
very
fond
sir
of
talking
about
the
consideration
we
owe
to
the
community
it
seems
to
me
however
that
the
community
has
its
duties
too
why
should
science
and
capital
venture
to
introduce
these
new
discoveries
into
labour
before
the
community
has
had
time
to
educate
a
generation
up
to
using
them
bernick
you
read
and
think
too
much
aune
it
does
you
no
good
and
that
is
what
makes
you
dissatisfied
with
your
lot
aune
it
is
not
bernick
but
i
can
not
bear
to
see
one
good
workman
dismissed
after
another
to
starve
because
of
these
machines
bernick
hm
when
the
art
of
printing
was
discovered
many
a
was
reduced
to
starvation
aune
would
you
have
admired
the
art
so
greatly
if
you
had
been
a
in
those
days
sir
bernick
i
did
not
send
for
you
to
argue
with
you
i
sent
for
you
to
tell
you
that
the
indian
girl
must
be
ready
to
put
to
sea
the
day
after
tomorrow
aune
but
bernick
bernick
the
day
after
tomorrow
do
you
hear
at
the
same
time
as
our
own
ship
not
an
hour
later
i
have
good
reasons
for
hurrying
on
the
work
have
you
seen
today
paper
well
then
you
know
the
pranks
these
american
sailors
have
been
up
to
again
the
rascally
pack
are
turning
the
whole
town
upside
down
not
a
night
passes
without
some
brawling
in
the
taverns
or
the
streets
not
to
speak
of
other
abominations
aune
yes
they
certainly
are
a
bad
lot
bernick
and
who
is
it
that
has
to
bear
the
blame
for
all
this
disorder
it
is
i
yes
it
is
i
who
have
to
suffer
for
it
these
newspaper
fellows
are
making
all
sorts
of
covert
insinuations
because
we
are
devoting
all
our
energies
to
the
palm
tree
i
whose
task
in
life
it
is
to
influence
my
by
the
force
of
example
have
to
endure
this
sort
of
thing
cast
in
my
face
i
am
not
going
to
stand
that
i
have
no
fancy
for
having
my
good
name
smirched
in
that
way
aune
your
name
stands
high
enough
to
endure
that
and
a
great
deal
more
sir
bernick
not
just
now
at
this
particular
moment
i
have
need
of
all
the
respect
and
goodwill
my
can
give
me
i
have
a
big
undertaking
on
the
stocks
as
you
probably
have
heard
but
if
it
should
happen
that
persons
succeeded
in
shaking
the
absolute
confidence
i
enjoy
it
might
land
me
in
the
greatest
difficulties
that
is
why
i
want
at
any
price
to
avoid
these
shameful
innuendoes
in
the
papers
and
that
is
why
i
name
the
day
after
tomorrow
as
the
limit
of
the
time
i
can
give
you
aune
bernick
you
might
just
as
well
name
this
afternoon
as
the
limit
bernick
you
mean
that
i
am
asking
an
impossibility
aune
yes
with
the
hands
we
have
now
at
the
yard
bernick
very
good
then
we
must
look
about
elsewhere
aune
do
you
really
mean
sir
to
discharge
still
more
of
your
old
workmen
bernick
no
i
am
not
thinking
of
that
aune
because
i
think
it
would
cause
bad
blood
against
you
both
among
the
townsfolk
and
in
the
papers
if
you
did
that
bernick
very
probably
therefore
we
will
not
do
it
but
if
the
indian
girl
is
not
ready
to
sail
the
day
after
tomorrow
i
shall
discharge
you
aune
with
a
start
me
he
laughs
you
are
joking
bernick
bernick
i
should
not
be
so
sure
of
that
if
i
were
you
aune
do
you
mean
that
you
can
contemplate
discharging
me
me
whose
father
and
grandfather
worked
in
your
yard
all
their
lives
as
i
have
done
myself
bernick
who
is
it
that
is
forcing
me
to
do
it
aune
you
are
asking
what
is
impossible
bernick
bernick
oh
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
yes
or
no
give
me
a
decisive
answer
or
consider
yourself
discharged
on
the
spot
aune
coming
a
step
nearer
to
him
bernick
have
you
ever
realised
what
discharging
an
old
workman
means
you
think
he
can
look
about
for
another
job
oh
yes
he
can
do
that
but
does
that
dispose
of
the
matter
you
should
just
be
there
once
in
the
house
of
a
workman
who
has
been
discharged
the
evening
he
comes
home
bringing
all
his
tools
with
him
bernick
do
you
think
i
am
discharging
you
with
a
light
heart
have
i
not
always
been
a
good
master
to
you
aune
so
much
the
worse
bernick
just
for
that
very
reason
those
at
home
will
not
blame
you
they
will
say
nothing
to
me
because
they
dare
not
but
they
will
look
at
me
when
i
am
not
noticing
and
think
that
i
must
have
deserved
it
you
see
sir
that
is
that
is
what
i
can
not
bear
i
am
a
mere
nobody
i
know
but
i
have
always
been
accustomed
to
stand
first
in
my
own
home
my
humble
home
is
a
little
community
too
bernick
a
little
community
which
i
have
been
able
to
support
and
maintain
because
my
wife
has
believed
in
me
and
because
my
children
have
believed
in
me
and
now
it
is
all
to
fall
to
pieces
bernick
still
if
there
is
nothing
else
for
it
the
lesser
must
go
down
before
the
greater
the
individual
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
general
welfare
i
can
give
you
no
other
answer
and
that
and
no
other
is
the
way
of
the
world
you
are
an
obstinate
man
aune
you
are
opposing
me
not
because
you
can
not
do
otherwise
but
because
you
will
not
exhibit
superiority
of
machinery
over
manual
labour
aune
and
you
will
not
be
moved
bernick
because
you
know
that
if
you
drive
me
away
you
will
at
all
events
have
given
the
newspapers
proof
of
your
good
will
bernick
and
suppose
that
were
so
i
have
told
you
what
it
means
for
me
either
bringing
the
press
down
on
my
back
or
making
them
to
me
at
a
moment
when
i
am
working
for
an
objective
which
will
mean
the
advancement
of
the
general
welfare
well
then
can
i
do
otherwise
than
as
i
am
doing
the
question
let
me
tell
you
turns
upon
this
whether
your
home
is
to
be
supported
as
you
put
it
or
whether
hundreds
of
new
homes
are
to
be
prevented
from
existing
hundreds
of
homes
that
will
never
be
built
never
have
a
fire
lighted
on
their
hearth
unless
i
succeed
in
carrying
through
the
scheme
i
am
working
for
now
that
is
the
reason
why
i
have
given
you
your
choice
aune
well
if
that
is
the
way
things
stand
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
bernick
hm
my
dear
aune
i
am
extremely
grieved
to
think
that
we
are
to
part
aune
we
are
not
going
to
part
bernick
bernick
how
is
that
aune
even
a
common
man
like
myself
has
something
he
is
bound
to
maintain
bernick
quite
so
quite
so
then
i
presume
you
think
you
may
promise
aune
the
indian
girl
shall
be
ready
to
sail
the
day
after
tomorrow
bows
and
goes
out
to
the
right
bernick
ah
i
have
got
the
better
of
that
obstinate
fellow
i
take
it
as
a
good
omen
hilmar
comes
in
through
the
garden
door
smoking
a
cigar
hilmar
as
he
comes
up
the
steps
to
the
verandah
good
morning
betty
good
morning
karsten
bernick
good
morning
hilmar
ah
i
see
you
have
been
crying
so
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
it
too
bernick
know
all
about
what
hilmar
that
the
scandal
is
in
full
swing
ugh
bernick
what
do
you
mean
hilmar
coming
into
the
room
why
that
our
two
friends
from
america
are
displaying
themselves
about
the
streets
in
the
company
of
dina
dorf
bernick
coming
in
after
him
hilmar
is
it
possible
hilmar
yes
unfortunately
it
is
quite
true
lona
was
even
so
wanting
in
tact
as
to
call
after
me
but
of
course
i
appeared
not
to
have
heard
her
bernick
and
no
doubt
all
this
has
not
been
unnoticed
hilmar
you
may
well
say
that
people
stood
still
and
looked
at
them
it
spread
like
wildfire
through
the
town
just
like
a
prairie
fire
out
west
in
every
house
people
were
at
the
windows
waiting
for
the
procession
to
pass
cheek
by
jowl
behind
the
curtains
ugh
oh
you
must
excuse
me
betty
for
saying
ugh
this
has
got
on
my
nerves
if
it
is
going
on
i
shall
be
forced
to
think
about
getting
right
away
from
here
bernick
but
you
should
have
spoken
to
him
and
represented
to
him
that
hilmar
in
the
open
street
no
excuse
me
i
could
not
do
that
to
think
that
the
fellow
should
dare
to
show
himself
in
the
town
at
all
well
we
shall
see
if
the
press
does
put
a
stopper
on
him
yes
forgive
me
betty
but
bernick
the
press
do
you
say
have
you
heard
a
hint
of
anything
of
the
sort
hilmar
there
are
such
things
flying
about
when
i
left
here
yesterday
evening
i
looked
in
at
the
club
because
i
did
not
feel
well
i
saw
at
once
from
the
sudden
silence
that
fell
when
i
went
in
that
our
american
couple
had
been
the
subject
of
conversation
then
that
impudent
newspaper
fellow
hammer
came
in
and
congratulated
me
at
the
top
of
his
voice
on
the
return
of
my
rich
cousin
bernick
rich
hilmar
those
were
his
words
naturally
i
looked
him
up
and
down
in
the
manner
he
deserved
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
i
knew
nothing
about
johan
tonnesen
being
rich
really
he
said
that
is
very
remarkable
people
usually
get
on
in
america
when
they
have
something
to
start
with
and
i
believe
your
cousin
did
not
go
over
there
quite
bernick
hm
now
will
you
oblige
me
by
bernick
distressed
there
you
see
karsten
hilmar
anyhow
i
have
spent
a
sleepless
night
because
of
them
and
here
he
is
walking
about
the
streets
as
if
nothing
were
the
matter
why
could
he
disappear
for
good
and
all
it
really
is
insufferable
how
hard
some
people
are
to
kill
bernick
my
dear
hilmar
what
are
you
saying
p
hilmar
oh
nothing
but
here
this
fellow
escapes
with
a
whole
skin
from
railway
accidents
and
fights
with
california
grizzlies
and
blackfoot
indians
has
not
even
been
scalped
ugh
here
they
come
bernick
looking
down
the
street
olaf
is
with
them
too
hilmar
of
course
they
want
to
remind
everybody
that
they
belong
to
the
best
family
in
the
town
look
there
look
at
the
crowd
of
loafers
that
have
come
out
of
the
chemist
to
stare
at
them
and
make
remarks
my
nerves
really
wo
stand
it
how
a
man
is
to
be
expected
to
keep
the
banner
of
the
ideal
flying
under
such
circumstances
i
bernick
they
are
coming
here
listen
betty
it
is
my
particular

a
pleasure
all
the
same
to
see
how
people
appreciate
you

am
not
vain
i
hope

i
could

by
ourselves

couple
of

of
your
morality

market

made
out

very
busy

opportunity

a
good

your
three
pioneers
here

parson
hilmar

schoolmaster

parson

me
what
you

of
my

precious
proud
of
him
goodness

it
is
about
the
only
thing
i
have
done
in
my
life
but
it
does
give
me
a
sort
of
right
to
exist
when
i
think
johan
how
we
two
began
over
there
with
nothing
but
our
four
bare
fists
hilmar
hands

i
say
fists
and

were
dirty
fists

what
is
the
matter
with
the
man
bernick

look
at
the
garden

great
many
alterations

now

the
verandah

serious
bent
towards
the
strength
of
character
necessary

down
to
the
garden

right
shaking
the
dust
off

do
you
not
often
go
for
a
walk
in
the
morning
dina
oh
yes
but
only
with
olaf
johan
i
would
you
rather
go
down
into
the
garden
than
stay
here
dina
no
i
would
rather
stay
here
johan
so
would
i
then
shall
we
consider
it
a
bargain
that
we
are
to
go
for
a
walk
like
this
together
every
morning
dina
no
tonnesen
you
must
do
that
johan
what
must
i
do
you
promised
you
know
dina
yes
but
on
second
thought
you
must
go
out
with
me
johan
but
why
not
dina
of
course
you
are
a
stranger
you
can
not
understand
but
i
must
tell
you
johan
well
dina
no
i
would
rather
not
talk
about
it
johan
oh
but
you
must
you
can
talk
to
me
about
whatever
you
like
dina
well
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
not
like
the
other
young
girls
here
there
is
something
something
or
other
about
me
that
is
why
you
must
johan
but
i
do
not
understand
anything
about
it
you
have
not
done
anything
wrong
dina
no
not
i
but
no
i
am
not
going
to
talk
any
more
about
it
now
you
will
hear
about
it
from
the
others
sure
enough
johan
hm
dina
but
there
is
something
else
i
want
very
much
to
ask
you
johan
what
is
that
dina
i
suppose
it
is
easy
to
make
a
position
for
oneself
over
in
america
johan
no
it
is
not
always
easy
at
first
you
often
have
to
rough
it
and
work
very
hard
dina
i
should
be
quite
ready
to
do
that
johan
you
dina
i
can
work
now
i
am
strong
and
healthy
and
aunt
martha
taught
me
a
lot
johan
well
hang
it
come
back
with
us
dina
ah
now
you
are
only
making
fun
of
me
you
said
that
to
olaf
too
but
what
i
wanted
to
know
is
if
people
are
so
very
so
very
moral
over
there
johan
moral
dina
yes
i
mean
are
they
as
as
proper
and
as
as
they
are
here
johan
well
at
all
events
they
are
not
so
bad
as
people
here
make
out
you
need
not
be
afraid
on
that
score
dina
you
do
understand
me
what
i
want
to
hear
is
just
that
they
are
not
so
proper
and
so
moral
johan
not
what
would
you
wish
them
to
be
then
dina
i
would
wish
them
to
be
natural
johan
well
i
believe
that
is
just
what
they
are
dina
because
in
that
case
i
should
get
on
if
i
went
there
johan
you
would
for
certain
and
that
is
why
you
must
come
back
with
us
dina
no
i
do
want
to
go
with
you
i
must
go
alone
oh
i
would
make
something
of
my
life
i
would
get
on
bernick
speaking
to
lona
and
his
wife
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
steps
wait
a
moment
i
will

his
wife

come
out
too
johan

are
going
down
to
the
grotto
bernick

want
johan
to
stay
here
look
here
dina
you
take
my
wife
shawl
and
go
with
them
johan
is
going
to
stay
here
with
me
betty
dear
i
want
to
hear
how
he
is
getting
on
over
there
bernick
very
well
then
you
will
follow
us
you
know
where
you
will
find
us
bernick
lona
and
dina
go
out
through
the
garden
to
the
left
bernick
looks
after
them
for
a
moment
then
goes
to
the
farther
door
on
the
left
and
locks
it
after
which
he
goes
up
to
johan
grasps
both
his
hands
and
shakes
them
warmly
bernick
johan
now
that
we
are
alone
you
must
let
me
thank
you
johan
oh
nonsense
bernick
my
home
and
all
the
happiness
that
it
means
to
me
my
position
here
as
a
citizen
all
these
i
owe
to
you
johan
well
i
am
glad
of
it
karsten
some
good
came
of
that
mad
story
after
all
then
bernick
grasping
his
hands
again
but
still
you
must
let
me
thank
you
not
one
in
ten
thousand
would
have
done
what
you
did
for
me
johan
rubbish
were
we
both
of
us
young
and
thoughtless
one
of
us
had
to
take
the
blame
you
know
bernick
but
surely
the
guilty
one
was
the
proper
one
to
do
that
johan
stop
at
the
moment
the
innocent
one
happened
to
be
the
proper
one
to
do
it
remember
i
had
no
ties
i
was
an
orphan
it
was
a
lucky
chance
to
get
free
from
the
drudgery
of
the
office
you
on
the
other
hand
had
your
old
mother
still
alive
and
besides
that
you
had
just
become
secretly
engaged
to
betty
who
was
devoted
to
you
what
would
have
happened
between
you
and
her
if
it
had
come
to
her
ears
bernick
that
is
true
enough
but
still
johan
and
was
it
just
for
betty
sake
that
you
broke
off
your
acquaintance
with
dorf
why
it
was
merely
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
the
whole
thing
that
you
were
up
there
with
her
that
evening
bernick
yes
that
unfortunate
evening
when
that
drunken
creature
came
home
yes
johan
it
was
for
betty
sake
but
all
the
same
it
was
splendid
of
you
to
let
all
the
appearances
go
against
you
and
to
go
away
johan
put
your
scruples
to
rest
my
dear
karsten
we
agreed
that
it
should
be
so
you
had
to
be
saved
and
you
were
my
friend
i
can
tell
you
i
was
uncommonly
proud
of
that
friendship
here
was
i
drudging
away
like
a
miserable
when
you
came
back
from
your
grand
tour
abroad
a
great
swell
who
had
been
to
london
and
to
paris
and
you
chose
me
for
your
chum
although
i
was
four
years
younger
than
you
it
is
true
it
was
because
you
were
courting
betty
i
understand
that
now
but
i
was
proud
of
it
who
would
not
have
been
who
would
not
willingly
have
sacrificed
himself
for
you
especially
as
it
only
meant
a
month
talk
in
the
town
and
enabled
me
to
get
away
into
the
wide
world
bernick
ah
my
dear
johan
i
must
be
candid
and
tell
you
that
the
story
is
not
so
completely
forgotten
yet
johan
is
it
well
what
does
that
matter
to
me
once
i
am
back
over
there
on
my
farm
again
bernick
then
you
mean
to
go
back
johan
of
course
bernick
but
not
immediately
i
hope
johan
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
only
to
humour
lona
that
i
came
over
with
her
you
know
bernick
really
how
so
johan
well
you
see
lona
is
no
longer
young
and
lately
she
began
to
be
obsessed
with
but
she
never
would
admit
it
smiles
how
could
she
venture
to
risk
leaving
such
a
flighty
fellow
as
me
alone
who
before
i
was
nineteen
had
been
mixed
up
in
bernick
well
what
then
johan
well
karsten
now
i
am
coming
to
a
confession
that
i
am
ashamed
to
make
bernick
you
surely
have
confided
the
truth
to
her
johan
yes
it
was
wrong
of
me
but
i
could
not
do
otherwise
you
can
have
no
conception
what
lona
has
been
to
me
you
never
could
put
up
with
her
but
she
has
been
like
a
mother
to
me
the
first
year
we
were
out
there
when
things
went
so
badly
with
us
you
have
no
idea
how
she
worked
and
when
i
was
ill
for
a
long
time
and
could
earn
nothing
and
could
not
prevent
her
she
took
to
singing
ballads
in
taverns
and
gave
lectures
that
people
laughed
at
and
then
she
wrote
a
book
that
she
has
both
laughed
and
cried
over
since
then
all
to
keep
the
life
in
me
could
i
look
on
when
in
the
winter
she
who
had
toiled
and
drudged
for
me
began
to
pine
away
no
karsten
i
could
and
so
i
said
you
go
home
for
a
trip
lona
do
be
afraid
for
me
i
am
not
so
flighty
as
you
think
and
so
the
end
of
it
was
that
she
had
to
know
bernick
and
how
did
she
take
it
johan
well
she
thought
as
was
true
that
as
i
knew
i
was
innocent
nothing
need
prevent
me
from
taking
a
trip
over
here
with
her
but
make
your
mind
easy
lona
will
let
nothing
out
and
i
shall
keep
my
mouth
shut
as
i
did
before
bernick
yes
yes
i
rely
on
that
johan
here
is
my
hand
on
it
and
now
we
will
say
no
more
about
that
old
story
luckily
it
is
the
only
mad
prank
either
of
us
has
been
guilty
of
i
am
sure
i
want
thoroughly
to
enjoy
the
few
days
i
shall
stay
here
you
can
not
think
what
a
delightful
walk
we
had
this
morning
who
would
have
believed
that
that
little
imp
who
used
to
run
about
here
and
play
angels
parts
on
the
stage
but
tell
me
my
dear
fellow
what
became
of
her
parents
afterwards
bernick
oh
my
boy
i
can
tell
you
no
more
than
i
wrote
to
you
immediately
after
you
went
away
i
suppose
you
got
my
two
letters
johan
yes
yes
i
have
them
both
so
that
drunken
fellow
deserted
her
bernick
and
drank
himself
to
death
afterwards
johan
and
she
died
soon
afterwards
too
bernick
she
was
proud
she
betrayed
nothing
and
would
accept
nothing
johan
well
at
all
events
you
did
the
right
thing
by
taking
dina
into
your
house
bernick
i
suppose
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
martha
that
brought
that
about
johan
so
it
was
martha
by
the
way
where
is
she
today
bernick
she
oh
when
she
has
her
school
to
look
after
she
has
her
sick
people
to
see
to
johan
so
it
was
martha
who
interested
herself
in
her
bernick
yes
you
know
martha
has
always
had
a
certain
liking
for
teaching
so
she
took
a
post
in
the
it
was
very
ridiculous
of
her
johan
i
thought
she
looked
very
worn
yesterday
i
should
be
afraid
her
health
was
not
good
enough
for
it
bernick
oh
as
far
as
her
health
goes
it
is
all
right
enough
but
it
is
unpleasant
for
me
it
looks
as
though
i
her
brother
were
not
willing
to
support
her
johan
support
her
i
thought
she
had
means
enough
of
her
own
bernick
not
a
penny
surely
you
remember
how
badly
off
our
mother
was
when
you
went
away
she
carried
things
on
for
a
time
with
my
assistance
but
naturally
i
could
not
put
up
with
that
state
of
affairs
permanently
i
made
her
take
me
into
the
firm
but
even
then
things
did
not
go
well
so
i
had
to
take
over
the
whole
business
myself
and
when
we
made
up
our
it
became
evident
that
there
was
practically
nothing
left
as
my
mother
share
and
when
mother
died
soon
afterwards
of
course
martha
was
left
penniless
johan
poor
martha
bernick
poor
why
you
surely
do
not
suppose
i
let
her
want
for
anything
no
i
venture
to
say
i
am
a
good
brother
of
course
she
has
a
home
here
with
us
her
salary
as
a
teacher
is
more
than
enough
for
her
to
dress
on
what
more
could
she
want
johan
hm
that
is
not
our
idea
of
things
in
america
bernick
no
i
dare
say
not
in
such
a
revolutionary
state
of
society
as
you
find
there
but
in
our
small
circle
in
which
thank
god
depravity
has
not
gained
a
footing
up
to
now
at
all
events
women
are
content
to
occupy
a
seemly
as
well
as
modest
position
moreover
it
is
martha
own
fault
i
mean
she
might
have
been
provided
for
long
ago
if
she
had
wished
johan
you
mean
she
might
have
married
bernick
yes
and
married
very
well
too
she
has
had
several
good
offers
curiously
enough
when
you
think
that
she
is
a
poor
girl
no
longer
young
and
besides
quite
an
insignificant
person
johan
insignificant
bernick
oh
i
am
not
blaming
her
for
that
i
most
certainly
would
not
wish
her
otherwise
i
can
tell
you
it
is
always
a
good
thing
to
have
a
person
like
that
in
a
big
house
like
this
some
one
you
can
rely
on
in
any
contingency
johan
yes
but
what
does
she
bernick
she
how
oh
well
of
course
she
has
plenty
to
interest
herself
in
she
has
betty
and
olaf
and
me
people
should
not
think
first
of
themselves
women
least
of
all
we
have
all
got
some
community
great
or
small
to
work
for
that
is
my
principle
at
all
events
points
to
krap
who
has
come
in
from
the
right
ah
here
is
an
example
of
it
ready
to
hand
do
you
suppose
that
it
is
my
own
affairs
that
are
absorbing
me
just
now
by
no
means
eagerly
to
krap
well
krap
in
an
undertone
showing
him
a
bundle
of
papers
here
are
all
the
sale
contracts
completed
bernick
capital
splendid
well
johan
you
must
really
excuse
me
for
the
present
in
a
low
voice
grasping
his
hand
thanks
johan
thanks
and
rest
assured
that
anything
i
can
do
for
you
well
of
course
you
understand
come
along
krap
they
go
into
bernick
room
johan
looking
after
them
for
a
moment
hm
turns
to
go
down
to
the
garden
at
the
same
moment
martha
comes
in
from
the
right
with
a
little
basket
over
her
arm
martha
martha
ah
johan
is
it
you
johan
out
so
early
martha

a
moment
the
others
are
just
coming
moves
towards
the
door
on
the
left
johan
martha
are
you
always
in
such
a
hurry
martha
i
johan
yesterday
you
seemed
to
avoid
me
so
that
i
never
managed
to
have
a
word
with
you
we
two
old
playfellows
martha
ah
johan
that
is
many
many
years
ago
johan
good
lord
why
it
is
only
fifteen
years
ago
no
more
and
no
less
do
you
think
i
have
changed
so
much
martha
you
oh
yes
you
have
changed
too
although
johan
what
do
you
mean
martha
oh
nothing
johan
you
do
not
seem
to
be
very
glad
to
see
me
again
martha
i
have
waited
so
long
johan
too
long
johan
waited
for
me
to
come
martha
yes
johan
and
why
did
you
think
i
would
come
martha
to
atone
for
the
wrong
you
had
done
johan
i
martha
have
you
forgotten
that
it
was
through
you
that
a
woman
died
in
need
and
in
shame
have
you
forgotten
that
it
was
through
you
that
the
best
years
of
a
young
girl
life
were
embittered
johan
and
you
can
say
such
things
to
me
martha
has
your
brother
never
martha
never
what
johan
has
he
never
oh
of
course
i
mean
has
he
never
so
much
as
said
a
word
in
my
defence
martha
ah
johan
you
know
karsten
high
principles
johan
hm
oh
of
course
i
know
my
old
friend
karsten
high
principles
but
really
this
is
well
well
i
was
having
a
talk
with
him
just
now
he
seems
to
me
to
have
altered
considerably
martha
how
can
you
say
that
i
am
sure
karsten
has
always
been
an
excellent
man
johan
yes
that
was
not
exactly
what
i
meant
but
never
mind
hm
now
i
understand
the
light
you
have
seen
me
in
it
was
the
return
of
the
prodigal
that
you
were
waiting
for
martha
johan
i
will
tell
you
what
light
i
have
seen
you
in
points
down
to
the
garden
do
you
see
that
girl
playing
on
the
grass
down
there
with
olaf
that
is
dina
do
you
remember
that
incoherent
letter
you
wrote
me
when
you
went
away
you
asked
me
to
believe
in
you
i
have
believed
in
you
johan
all
the
horrible
things
that
were
rumoured
about
you
after
you
had
gone
must
have
been
done
through
being
led
astray
from
thoughtlessness
without
premeditation
johan
what
do
you
mean
martha
oh
you
understand
me
well
enough
not
a
word
more
of
that
but
of
course
you
had
to
go
away
and
begin
afresh
a
new
life
your
duties
here
which
you
never
remembered
to
undertake
or
never
were
able
to
undertake
i
have
undertaken
for
you
i
tell
you
this
so
that
you
shall
not
have
that
also
to
reproach
yourself
with
i
have
been
a
mother
to
that
child
i
have
brought
her
up
as
well
as
i
was
able
johan
and
have
wasted
your
whole
life
for
that
reason
martha
it
has
not
been
wasted
but
you
have
come
late
johan
johan
martha
if
only
i
could
tell
you
well
at
all
events
let
me
thank
you
for
your
loyal
friendship
martha
with
a
sad
smile
well
we
have
had
it
out
now
johan
hush
some
one
is
coming
goodbye
i
ca
stay
now
goes
out
through
the
farther
door
on
the
left
lona
comes
in
from
the
garden
followed
by
mrs
bernick
bernick
but
good
gracious
lona
what
are
you
thinking
of
lona
let
me
be
i
tell
you
i
must
and
will
speak
to
him
bernick
but
it
would
be
a
scandal
of
the
worst
sort
ah
johan
still
here
lona
out
with
you
my
boy
do
stay
here
in
doors
go
down
into
the
garden
and
have
a
chat
with
dina
johan
i
was
just
thinking
of
doing
so
bernick
but
lona
look
here
johan
have
you
had
a
good
look
at
dina
johan
i
should
think
so
lona
well
look
at
her
to
some
purpose
my
boy
that
would
be
somebody
for
you
bernick
but
lona
johan
somebody
for
me
lona
yes
to
look
at
i
mean
be
off
with
you
johan
oh
i
do
need
any
pressing
goes
down
into
the
garden
bernick
lona
you
astound
me
you
can
not
possibly
be
serious
about
it
lona
indeed
i
am
is
she
sweet
and
healthy
and
honest
she
is
exactly
the
wife
for
johan
she
is
just
what
he
needs
over
there
it
will
be
a
change
from
an
old
bernick
dina
dina
dorf
but
think
lona
i
think
first
and
foremost
of
the
boy
happiness
because
help
him
i
must
he
has
not
much
idea
of
that
sort
of
thing
he
has
never
had
much
of
an
eye
for
girls
or
women
bernick
he
johan
indeed
i
think
we
have
had
only
too
sad
proofs
that
lona
oh
devil
take
all
those
stupid
stories
where
is
karsten
i
mean
to
speak
to
him
bernick
lona
you
must
not
do
it
i
tell
you
lona
i
am
going
to
if
the
boy
takes
a
fancy
to
her
and
she
to
him
then
they
shall
make
a
match
of
it
karsten
is
such
a
clever
man
he
must
find
some
way
to
bring
it
about
bernick
and
do
you
think
these
american
indecencies
will
be
permitted
here
lona
bosh
betty
bernick
do
you
think
a
man
like
karsten
with
his
strictly
moral
way
of
thinking
lona
pooh
he
is
not
so
terribly
moral
bernick
what
have
you
the
audacity
to
say
lona
i
have
the
audacity
to
say
that
karsten
is
not
any
more
particularly
moral
than
anybody
else
bernick
so
you
still
hate
him
as
deeply
as
that
but
what
are
you
doing
here
if
you
have
never
been
able
to
forget
that
i
can
not
understand
how
you
dare
look
him
in
the
face
after
the
shameful
insult
you
put
upon
him
in
the
old
days
lona
yes
betty
that
time
i
did
forget
myself
badly
bernick
and
to
think
how
magnanimously
he
has
forgiven
you
he
who
had
never
done
any
wrong
it
was
not
his
fault
that
you
encouraged
yourself
with
hopes
but
since
then
you
have
always
hated
me
too
bursts
into
tears
you
have
always
begrudged
me
my
good
fortune
and
now
you
come
here
to
heap
all
this
on
my
head
to
let
the
whole
town
know
what
sort
of
a
family
i
have
brought
karsten
into
yes
it
is
me
that
it
all
falls
upon
and
that
is
what
you
want
oh
it
is
abominable
of
you
goes
out
by
the
door
on
the
left
in
tears
lona
looking
after
her
poor
betty
bernick
comes
in
from
his
room
he
stops
at
the
door
to
speak
to
krap
bernick
yes
that
is
excellent
krap
capital
send
twenty
pounds
to
the
fund
for
dinners
to
the
poor
turns
round
lona
comes
forward
are
you
alone
is
betty
not
coming
in
lona
no
would
you
like
me
to
call
her
bernick
no
no
not
at
all
oh
lona
you
do
know
how
anxious
i
have
been
to
speak
openly
to
you
after
having
begged
for
your
forgiveness
lona
look
here
karsten
do
not
let
us
be
sentimental
it
does
suit
us
bernick
you
must
listen
to
me
lona
i
know
only
too
well
how
much
appearances
are
against
me
as
you
have
learnt
all
about
that
affair
with
dina
mother
but
i
swear
to
you
that
it
was
only
a
temporary
infatuation
i
was
really
truly
and
honestly
in
love
with
you
once
lona
why
do
you
think
i
have
come
home
bernick
whatever
you
have
in
your
mind
i
entreat
you
to
do
nothing
until
i
have
exculpated
myself
i
can
do
that
lona
at
all
events
i
can
excuse
myself
lona
now
you
are
frightened
you
once
were
in
love
with
me
you
say
yes
you
told
me
that
often
enough
in
your
letters
and
perhaps
it
was
true
too
in
a
way
as
long
as
you
were
living
out
in
the
great
free
world
which
gave
you
the
courage
to
think
freely
and
greatly
perhaps
you
found
in
me
a
little
more
character
and
strength
of
will
and
independence
than
in
most
of
the
folk
at
home
here
and
then
we
kept
it
secret
between
us
nobody
could
make
fun
of
your
bad
taste
bernick
lona
how
can
you
think
lona
but
when
you
came
back
when
you
heard
the
gibes
that
were
made
at
me
on
all
sides
when
you
noticed
how
people
laughed
at
what
they
called
my
absurdities
bernick
you
were
regardless
of
people
opinion
at
that
time
lona
chiefly
to
annoy
the
petticoated
and
trousered
prudes
that
one
met
at
every
turn
in
the
town
and
then
when
you
met
that
seductive
young
actress
bernick
it
was
a
boyish
escapade
nothing
more
i
swear
to
you
that
there
was
no
truth
in
a
tenth
part
of
the
rumours
and
gossip
that
went
about
lona
maybe
but
then
when
betty
came
home
a
pretty
young
girl
idolised
by
every
one
and
it
became
known
that
she
would
inherit
all
her
aunt
money
and
that
i
would
have
nothing
bernick
that
is
just
the
point
lona
and
now
you
shall
have
the
truth
without
any
beating
about
the
bush
i
did
not
love
betty
then
i
did
not
break
off
my
engagement
with
you
because
of
any
new
attachment
it
was
entirely
for
the
sake
of
the
money
i
needed
it
i
had
to
make
sure
of
it
lona
and
you
have
the
face
to
tell
me
that
bernick
yes
i
have
listen
lona
lona
and
yet
you
wrote
to
me
that
an
unconquerable
passion
for
betty
had
overcome
you
invoked
my
magnanimity
begged
me
for
betty
sake
to
hold
my
tongue
about
all
that
had
been
between
us
bernick
i
had
to
i
tell
you
lona
now
by
heaven
i
do
regret
that
i
forgot
myself
as
i
did
that
time
bernick
let
me
tell
you
the
plain
truth
of
how
things
stood
with
me
then
my
mother
as
you
remember
was
at
the
head
of
the
business
but
she
was
absolutely
without
any
business
ability
whatever
i
was
hurriedly
summoned
home
from
paris
times
were
critical
and
they
relied
on
me
to
set
things
straight
what
did
i
find
i
found
and
you
must
keep
this
a
profound
secret
a
house
on
the
brink
of
ruin
yes
as
good
as
on
the
brink
of
ruin
this
old
respected
house
which
had
seen
three
generations
of
us
what
else
could
i
the
son
the
only
son
do
than
look
about
for
some
means
of
saving
it
lona
and
so
you
saved
the
house
of
bernick
at
the
cost
of
a
woman
bernick
you
know
quite
well
that
betty
was
in
love
with
me
lona
but
what
about
me
bernick
believe
me
lona
you
would
never
have
been
happy
with
me
lona
was
it
out
of
consideration
for
my
happiness
that
you
sacrificed
me
bernick
do
you
suppose
i
acted
as
i
did
from
selfish
motives
if
i
had
stood
alone
then
i
would
have
begun
all
over
again
with
cheerful
courage
but
you
do
not
understand
how
the
life
of
a
man
of
business
with
his
tremendous
responsibilities
is
bound
up
with
that
of
the
business
which
falls
to
his
inheritance
do
you
realise
that
the
prosperity
or
the
ruin
of
hundreds
of
thousands
depends
on
him
can
you
not
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
whole
community
in
which
both
you
and
i
were
born
would
have
been
affected
to
the
most
dangerous
extent
if
the
house
of
bernick
had
gone
to
smash
lon
then
is
it
for
the
sake
of
the
community
that
you
have
maintained
your
position
these
fifteen
years
upon
a
lie
bernick
upon
a
lie
lona
what
does
betty
know
of
all
this
that
underlies
her
union
with
you
bernick
do
you
suppose
that
i
would
hurt
her
feelings
to
no
purpose
by
disclosing
the
truth
lona
to
no
purpose
you
say
well
well
you
are
a
man
of
business
you
ought
to
understand
what
is
to
the
purpose
but
listen
to
me
karsten
i
am
going
to
speak
the
plain
truth
now
tell
me
are
you
really
happy
bernick
in
my
family
life
do
you
mean
lona
yes
bernick
i
am
lona
you
have
not
been
a
friend
to
me
in
vain
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
have
grown
happier
every
year
betty
is
good
and
willing
and
if
i
were
to
tell
you
how
in
the
course
of
years
she
has
learned
to
model
her
character
on
the
lines
of
my
own
lona
hm
bernick
at
first
of
course
she
had
a
whole
lot
of
romantic
notions
about
love
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
the
idea
that
little
by
little
it
must
change
into
a
quiet
comradeship
lona
but
now
she
is
quite
reconciled
to
that
bernick
absolutely
as
you
can
imagine
daily
intercourse
with
me
has
had
no
small
share
in
developing
her
character
every
one
in
their
degree
has
to
learn
to
lower
their
own
pretensions
if
they
are
to
live
worthily
of
the
community
to
which
they
belong
and
betty
in
her
turn
has
gradually
learned
to
understand
this
and
that
is
why
our
home
is
now
a
model
to
our
fellow
citizens
lona
but
your
fellow
citizens
know
nothing
about
the
lie
bernick
the
lie
lona
yes
the
lie
you
have
persisted
in
for
these
fifteen
years
bernick
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
call
that
lona
i
call
it
a
lie
a
threefold
lie
first
of
all
there
is
the
lie
towards
me
then
the
lie
towards
betty
and
then
the
lie
towards
johan
bernick
betty

never
asked
me

not
demand
it
out
of
consideration
for
her
lona
oh
no
i
shall
manage
to
put
up
with
their
gibes
well
enough
i
have
broad
shoulders

and
johan
will
not
demand
it
either
he

promised
me
that
lona
but
you

no
impulse
urging
you

little
right

my
conduct
and
by
what
i
have
achieved

my
work

the
richest
and
most
influential
man
in
the
town
nobody
in
it
dares
do
otherwise
than
defer

your
will
because
you
are
looked
upon
as
a
man
without
spot
or
blemish
your
home
is
regarded
as
a
model
home
and
your
conduct
as
a
model
of
conduct
but
all
this
grandeur
and
you
with
it
is
founded
on
a
treacherous
morass
a
moment
may
come
and
a
word
may
be
spoken
when
you
and
all
your
grandeur
will
be
engulfed
in
the
morass

with
authority
and

will
be
silent

short
silence
johan
softly
grasping
bernick
by
the
arm
karsten
karsten
what
have
you

bernick
in
tears
oh
karsten
to
think
that
i
should
have
mixed
you
up
in
all
this
disgrace
sandstad
coming
in
hurriedly
from
the
right
and
calling
out
with
his
hand
still
on
the
you
positively
must
come
now
bernick
the
fate
of
the
whole
railway
is
hanging
by
a
thread
bernick
abstractedly
what
is
it
what
have
i
to
lona
earnestly
and
with
emphasis
you
have
to
go
and
be
a
pillar
of
society
sandstad
yes
come
along
we
need
the
full
weight
of
your
moral
excellence
on
our
side
johan
aside
to
bernick
karsten
we
will
have
a
talk
about
this
tomorrow
goes
out
through
the
garden
bernick
looking
half
dazed
goes
out
to
the
right
with
sandstad
act
iii
scene
the
same
room
bernick
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
and
evidently
in
a
great
rage
comes
out
of
the
farther
room
on
the
left
leaving
the
door
behind
him
bernick
speaking
to
his
wife
who
is
in
the
other
room
there
i
have
given
it
him
in
earnest
now
i
do
think
he
will
forget
that
thrashing
what
do
you
say
and
i
say
that
you
are
an
injudicious
mother
you
make
excuses
for
him
and
countenance
any
sort
of
rascality
on
his
part
not
rascality
what
do
you
call
it
then
slipping
out
of
the
house
at
night
going
out
in
a
fishing
boat
staying
away
till
well
on
in
the
day
and
giving
me
such
a
horrible
fright
when
i
have
so
much
to
worry
me
and
then
the
young
scamp
has
the
audacity
to
threaten
that
he
will
run
away
just
let
him
try
it
you
no
very
likely
you
trouble
yourself
much
about
what
happens
to
him
i
really
believe
that
if
he
were
to
get
killed
oh
really
well
i
have
work
to
leave
behind
me
in
the
world
i
have
no
fancy
for
being
left
childless
now
do
not
raise
objections
betty
it
shall
be
as
i
say
he
is
confined
to
the
house
listens
hush
do
not
let
any
one
notice
anything
krap
comes
in
from
the
right
krap
can
you
spare
me
a
moment
bernick
bernick
throwing
away
the
cane
certainly
certainly
have
you
come
from
the
yard
krap
yes
ahem
bernick
well
nothing
wrong
with
the
palm
tree
i
hope
krap
the
palm
tree
can
sail
tomorrow
but
bernick
it
is
the
indian
girl
then
i
had
a
suspicion
that
that
obstinate
fellow
krap
the
indian
girl
can
sail
tomorrow
too
but
i
am
sure
she
will
not
get
very
far
bernick
what
do
you
mean
krap
excuse
me
sir
that
door
is
standing
ajar
and
i
think
there
is
some
one
in
the
other
room
bernick
shutting
the
door
there
then
but
what
is
this
that
no
one
else
must
hear
krap
just
this
that
i
believe
aune
intends
to
let
the
indian
girl
go
to
the
bottom
with
every
mother
son
on
board
bernick
good
god
what
makes
you
think
that
krap
i
can
not
account
for
it
any
other
way
sir
bernick
well
tell
me
as
briefly
as
you
can
krap
i
will
you
know
yourself
how
slowly
the
work
has
gone
on
in
the
yard
since
we
got
the
new
machines
and
the
new
inexperienced
hands
bernick
yes
yes
krap
but
this
morning
when
i
went
down
there
i
noticed
that
the
repairs
to
the
american
boat
had
made
extraordinary
progress
the
great
hole
in
the
bottom
the
rotten
patch
you
know
bernick
yes
yes
what
about
it
krap
was
completely
repaired
to
all
appearance
at
any
rate
covered
up
looked
as
good
as
new
i
heard
that
aune
himself
had
been
working
at
it
by
lantern
light
the
whole
night
bernick
yes
yes
well
krap
i
turned
it
over
in
my
head
for
a
bit
the
hands
were
away
at
their
breakfast
so
i
found
an
opportunity
to
have
a
look
around
the
boat
both
outside
and
in
without
anyone
seeing
me
i
had
a
job
to
get
down
to
the
bottom
through
the
cargo
but
i
learned
the
truth
there
is
something
very
suspicious
going
on
bernick
bernick
i
can
not
believe
it
krap
i
can
not
and
will
not
believe
such
a
thing
of
aune
krap
i
am
very
sorry
but
it
is
the
simple
truth
something
very
suspicious
is
going
on
no
new
timbers
put
in
as
far
as
i
could
see
only
stopped
up
and
tinkered
at
and
covered
over
with
sailcloth
and
tarpaulins
and
that
sort
of
thing
an
absolute
fraud
the
indian
girl
will
never
get
to
new
york
she
will
go
to
the
bottom
like
a
cracked
pot
bernick
this
is
most
horrible
but
what
can
be
his
object
do
you
suppose
krap
probably
he
wants
to
bring
the
machines
into
discredit
wants
to
take
his
revenge
wants
to
force
you
to
take
the
old
hands
on
again
bernick
and
to
do
this
he
is
willing
to
sacrifice
the
lives
of
all
on
board
krap
he
said
the
other
day
that
there
were
no
men
on
board
the
indian
girl
only
wild
beasts
bernick
yes
but
apart
from
that
has
he
no
regard
for
the
great
loss
of
capital
it
would
mean
krap
aune
does
not
look
upon
capital
with
a
very
friendly
eye
bernick
bernick
that
is
perfectly
true
he
is
an
agitator
and
a
fomenter
of
discontent
but
such
an
unscrupulous
thing
as
this
look
here
krap
you
must
look
into
the
matter
once
more
not
a
word
of
it
to
any
one
the
blame
will
fall
on
our
yard
if
any
one
hears
anything
of
it
krap
of
course
but
bernick
when
the
hands
are
away
at
their
dinner
you
must
manage
to
get
down
there
again
i
must
have
absolute
certainty
about
it
krap
you
shall
sir
but
excuse
me
what
do
you
propose
to
do
bernick
report
the
affair
naturally
we
can
not
of
course
let
ourselves
become
accomplices
in
such
a
crime
i
could
not
have
such
a
thing
on
my
conscience
moreover
it
will
make
a
good
impression
both
on
the
press
and
on
the
public
in
general
if
it
is
seen
that
i
set
all
personal
interests
aside
and
let
justice
take
its
course
krap
quite
true
bernick
bernick
but
first
of
all
i
must
be
absolutely
certain
and
meanwhile
do
not
breathe
a
word
of
it
krap
not
a
word
sir
and
you
shall
have
your
certainty
goes
out
through
the
garden
and
down
the
street
bernick
half
aloud
shocking
but
no
it
is
impossible
inconceivable
as
he
turns
to
go
into
his
room
hilmar
comes
in
from
the
right
hilmar
good
morning
karsten
let
me
congratulate
you
on
your
triumph
at
the
commercial
association
yesterday
bernick
thank
you
hilmar
it
was
a
brilliant
triumph
i
hear
the
triumph
of
intelligent
public
spirit
over
selfishness
and
prejudice
something
like
a
raid
of
french
troops
on
the
kabyles
it
is
astonishing
that
after
that
unpleasant
scene
here
you
could
bernick
yes
yes
quite
so
hilmar
but
the
decisive
battle
has
not
been
fought
yet
bernick
in
the
matter
of
the
railway
do
you
mean
hilmar
yes
i
suppose
you
know
the
trouble
that
hammer
is
brewing
bernick
anxiously
no
what
is
that
hilmar
oh
he
is
greatly
taken
up
with
the
rumour
that
is
going
around
and
is
preparing
to
dish
up
an
article
about
it
bernick
what
rumour
hilmar
about
the
extensive
purchase
of
property
along
the
branch
line
of
course
bernick
what
is
there
such
a
rumour
as
that
going
about
hilmar
it
is
all
over
the
town
i
heard
it
at
the
club
when
i
looked
in
there
they
say
that
one
of
our
lawyers
has
quietly
bought
up
on
commission
all
the
forest
land
all
the
mining
land
all
the
waterfalls
bernick
do
they
say
whom
it
was
for
hilmar
at
the
club
they
thought
it
must
be
for
some
company
not
connected
with
this
town
that
has
got
a
hint
of
the
scheme
you
have
in
hand
and
has
made
haste
to
buy
before
the
price
of
these
properties
went
up
is
it
villainous
ugh
bernick
villainous
hilmar
yes
to
have
strangers
putting
their
fingers
into
our
pie
and
one
of
our
own
local
lawyers
lending
himself
to
such
a
thing
and
now
it
will
be
outsiders
that
will
get
all
the
profits
bernick
but
after
all
it
is
only
an
idle
rumour
hilmar
meanwhile
people
are
believing
it
and
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
i
have
no
doubt
hammer
will
nail
it
to
the
counter
as
a
fact
there
is
a
general
sense
of
exasperation
in
the
town
already
i
heard
several
people
say
that
if
the
rumour
were
confirmed
they
would
take
their
names
off
the
subscription
lists
bernick
impossible
hilmar
is
it
why
do
you
suppose
these
creatures
were
so
willing
to
go
into
the
undertaking
with
you
do
you
suppose
they
have
scented
profit
for
themselves
bernick
it
is
impossible
i
am
sure
there
is
so
much
public
spirit
in
our
little
community
hilmar
in
our
community
of
course
you
are
a
confirmed
optimist
and
so
you
judge
others
by
yourself
but
i
who
am
a
tolerably
experienced
observer
there
is
a
single
soul
in
the
place
excepting
ourselves
of
course
not
a
single
soul
in
the
place
who
holds
up
the
banner
of
the
ideal
goes
towards
the
verandah
ugh
i
can
see
them
there
bernick
see
whom
hilmar
our
two
friends
from
america
looks
out
to
the
right
and
who
is
that
they
are
walking
with
as
i
am
alive
if
it
is
not
the
captain
of
the
indian
girl
ugh
bernick
what
can
they
want
with
him
hilmar
oh
he
is
just
the
right
company
for
them
he
looks
as
if
he
had
been
a
or
a
pirate
and
who
knows
what
the
other
two
may
have
been
doing
all
these
years
bernick
let
me
tell
you
that
it
is
grossly
unjust
to
think
such
things
about
them
hilmar
yes
you
are
an
optimist
but
here
they
are
bearing
down
upon
us
again
so
i
will
get
away
while
there
is
time
goes
towards
the
door
on
the
left
lona
comes
in
from
the
right
lona
oh
hilmar
am
i
driving
you
away
hilmar
not
at
all
i
am
in
rather
a
hurry
i
want
to
have
a
word
with
betty
goes
into
the
farthest
room
on
the
left
bernick
after
a
moment
silence
well
lona
lona
yes
bernick
what
do
you
think
of
me
today
lona
the
same
as
i
did
yesterday
a
lie
more
or
less
bernick
i
must
enlighten
you
about
it
where
has
johan
gone
lona
he
is
coming
he
had
to
see
a
man
first
bernick
after
what
you
heard
yesterday
you
will
understand
that
my
whole
life
will
be
ruined
if
the
truth
comes
to
light
lona
i
can
understand
that
bernick
of
course
it
stands
to
reason
that
i
was
not
guilty
of
the
crime
there
was
so
much
talk
about
here
lona
that
stands
to
reason
but
who
was
the
thief
bernick
there
was
no
thief
there
was
no
money
stolen
not
a
penny
lona
how
is
that
bernick
not
a
penny
i
tell
you
lona
but
those
rumours
how
did
that
shameful
rumour
get
about
that
johan
bernick
lona
i
think
i
can
speak
to
you
as
i
could
to
no
one
else
i
will
conceal
nothing
from
you
i
was
partly
to
blame
for
spreading
the
rumour
lona
you
you
could
act
in
that
way
towards
a
man
who
for
your
sake
bernick
do
not
condemn
me
without
bearing
in
mind
how
things
stood
at
that
time
i
told
you
about
it
yesterday
i
came
home
and
found
my
mother
involved
in
a
mesh
of
injudicious
undertakings
we
had
all
manner
of
bad
luck
it
seemed
as
if
misfortunes
were
raining
upon
us
and
our
house
was
on
the
verge
of
ruin
i
was
half
reckless
and
half
in
despair
lona
i
believe
it
was
mainly
to
deaden
my
thoughts
that
i
let
myself
drift
into
that
entanglement
that
ended
in
johan
going
away
lona
hm
bernick
you
can
well
imagine
how
every
kind
of
rumour
was
set
on
foot
after
you
and
he
had
gone
people
began
to
say
that
it
was
not
his
first
piece
of
folly
that
dorf
had
received
a
large
sum
of
money
to
hold
his
tongue
and
go
away
other
people
said
that
she
had
received
it
at
the
same
time
it
was
obvious
that
our
house
was
finding
it
difficult
to
meet
its
obligations
what
was
more
natural
than
that
should
find
some
connection
between
these
two
rumours
and
as
the
woman
remained
here
living
in
poverty
people
declared
that
he
had
taken
the
money
with
him
to
america
and
every
time
rumour
mentioned
the
sum
it
grew
larger
lona
and
you
karsten
bernick
i
grasped
at
the
rumour
like
a
drowning
man
at
a
straw
lona
you
helped
to
spread
it
bernick
i
did
not
contradict
it
our
creditors
had
begun
to
be
pressing
and
i
had
the
task
of
keeping
them
quiet
the
result
was
the
dissipating
of
any
suspicion
as
to
the
stability
of
the
firm
people
said
that
we
had
been
hit
by
a
temporary
piece
of
that
all
that
was
necessary
was
that
they
should
not
press
us
only
give
us
time
and
every
creditor
would
be
paid
in
full
lona
and
every
creditor
was
paid
in
full
bernick
yes
lona
that
rumour
saved
our
house
and
made
me
the
man
i
now
am
lona
that
is
to
say
a
lie
has
made
you
the
man
you
now
are
bernick
whom
did
it
injure
at
the
time
it
was
johan
intention
never
to
come
back
lona
you
ask
whom
it
injured
look
into
your
own
heart
and
tell
me
if
it
has
not
injured
you
bernick
look
into
any
man
heart
you
please
and
you
will
always
find
in
every
one
at
least
one
black
spot
which
he
has
to
keep
concealed
lona
and
you
call
yourselves
pillars
of
society
bernick
society
has
none
better
lona
and
of
what
consequence
is
it
whether
such
a
society
be
propped
up
or
not
what
does
it
all
consist
of
show
and
lies
and
nothing
else
here
are
you
the
first
man
in
the
town
living
in
grandeur
and
luxury
powerful
and
respected
you
who
have
branded
an
innocent
man
as
a
criminal
bernick
do
you
suppose
i
am
not
deeply
conscious
of
the
wrong
i
have
done
him
and
do
you
suppose
i
am
not
ready
to
make
amends
to
him
for
it
lona
how
by
speaking
out
bernick
would
you
have
the
heart
to
insist
on
that
lona
what
else
can
make
amends
for
such
a
wrong
bernick
i
am
rich
lona
johan
can
demand
any
sum
he
pleases
lona
yes
offer
him
money
and
you
will
hear
what
he
will
say
bernick
do
you
know
what
he
intends
to
do
lona
no
since
yesterday
he
has
been
dumb
he
looks
as
if
this
had
made
a
grown
man
of
him
all
at
once
bernick
i
must
talk
to
him
lona
here
he
comes
johan
comes
in
from
the
right
bernick
going
towards
hint
johan
johan
motioning
him
away
listen
to
me
first
yesterday
morning
i
gave
you
my
word
that
i
would
hold
my
tongue
bernick
you
did
johan
but
then
i
did
not
know
bernick
johan
only
let
me
say
a
word
or
two
to
explain
the
circumstances
johan
it
is
unnecessary
i
understand
the
circumstances
perfectly
the
firm
was
in
a
dangerous
position
at
the
time
i
had
gone
off
and
you
had
my
defenceless
name
and
reputation
at
your
mercy
well
i
do
not
blame
you
so
very
much
for
what
you
did
we
were
young
and
thoughtless
in
those
days
but
now
i
have
need
of
the
truth
and
now
you
must
speak
bernick
and
just
now
i
have
need
of
all
my
reputation
for
morality
and
therefore
i
can
not
speak
johan
i
do
take
much
account
of
the
false
reports
you
spread
about
me
it
is
the
other
thing
that
you
must
take
the
blame
of
i
shall
make
dina
my
wife
and
here
here
in
your
town
i
mean
to
settle
down
and
live
with
her
lona
is
that
what
you
mean
to
do
bernick
with
dina
dina
as
your
wife
in
this
town
johan
yes
here
and
nowhere
else
i
mean
to
stay
here
to
defy
all
these
liars
and
slanderers
but
before
i
can
win
her
you
must
exonerate
me
bernick
have
you
considered
that
if
i
confess
to
the
one
thing
it
will
inevitably
mean
making
myself
responsible
for
the
other
as
well
you
will
say
that
i
can
show
by
our
books
that
nothing
dishonest
happened
but
i
can
not
our
books
were
not
so
accurately
kept
in
those
days
and
even
if
i
could
what
good
would
it
do
should
i
not
in
any
case
be
pointed
at
as
the
man
who
had
once
saved
himself
by
an
untruth
and
for
fifteen
years
had
allowed
that
untruth
and
all
its
consequences
to
stand
without
having
raised
a
finger
to
demolish
it
you
do
not
know
our
community
very
much
or
you
would
realise
that
it
would
ruin
me
utterly
johan
i
can
only
tell
you
that
i
mean
to
make
dorf
daughter
my
wife
and
live
with
her
in
this
town
bernick
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
listen
to
me
johan
and
you
too
lona
the
circumstances
i
am
in
just
now
are
quite
exceptional
i
am
situated
in
such
a
way
that
if
you
aim
this
blow
at
me
you
will
not
only
destroy
me
but
will
also
destroy
a
great
future
rich
in
blessings
that
lies
before
the
community
which
after
all
was
the
home
of
your
childhood
johan
and
if
i
do
not
aim
this
blow
at
you
i
shall
be
destroying
all
my
future
happiness
with
my
own
hand
lona
go
on
karsten
bernick
i
will
tell
you
then
it
is
mixed
up
with
the
railway
project
and
the
whole
thing
is
not
quite
so
simple
as
you
think
i
suppose
you
have
heard
that
last
year
there
was
some
talk
of
a
railway
line
along
the
coast
many
influential
people
backed
up
the
idea
people
in
the
town
and
the
suburbs
and
especially
the
press
but
i
managed
to
get
the
proposal
quashed
on
the
ground
that
it
would
have
injured
our
steamboat
trade
along
the
coast
lona
have
you
any
interest
in
the
steamboat
trade
bernick
yes
but
no
one
ventured
to
suspect
me
on
that
account
my
honoured
name
fully
protected
me
from
that
for
the
matter
of
that
i
could
have
stood
the
loss
but
the
place
could
not
have
stood
it
so
the
inland
line
was
decided
upon
as
soon
as
that
was
done
i
assured
myself
without
saying
anything
about
it
that
a
branch
line
could
be
laid
to
the
town
lona
why
did
you
say
nothing
about
it
karsten
bernick
have
you
heard
the
rumours
of
extensive
buying
up
of
forest
lands
mines
and
waterfalls
johan
yes
apparently
it
is
some
company
from
another
part
of
the
country
bernick
as
these
properties
are
situated
at
present
they
are
as
good
as
valueless
to
their
owners
who
are
scattered
about
the
neighbourhood
they
have
therefore
been
sold
comparatively
cheap
if
the
purchaser
had
waited
till
the
branch
line
began
to
be
talked
of
the
proprietors
would
have
asked
exorbitant
prices
lona
well
what
then
bernick
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
that
can
be
construed
in
different
ways
a
thing
to
which
in
our
community
a
man
could
only
confess
provided
he
had
an
untarnished
and
honoured
name
to
take
his
stand
upon
lona
well
bernick
it
is
i
that
have
bought
up
the
whole
of
them
lona
you
johan
on
your
own
account
bernick
on
my
own
account
if
the
branch
line
becomes
an
accomplished
fact
i
am
a
millionaire
if
it
does
not
i
am
ruined
lona
it
is
a
big
risk
karsten
bernick
i
have
risked
my
whole
fortune
on
it
lona
i
am
not
thinking
of
your
fortune
but
if
it
comes
to
light
that
bernick
yes
that
is
the
critical
part
of
it
with
the
unblemished
and
honoured
name
i
have
hitherto
borne
i
can
take
the
whole
thing
upon
my
shoulders
carry
it
through
and
say
to
my
see
i
have
taken
this
risk
for
the
good
of
the
community
lona
of
the
community
bernick
yes
and
not
a
soul
will
doubt
my
motives
lona
then
some
of
those
concerned
in
it
have
acted
more
openly
without
any
secret
motives
or
considerations
bernick
who
lona
why
of
course
rummel
and
sandstad
and
vigeland
bernick
to
get
them
on
my
side
i
was
obliged
to
let
them
into
the
secret
lona
and
they
bernick
they
have
stipulated
for
a
fifth
part
of
the
profits
as
their
share
lona
oh
these
pillars
of
society
bernick
and
is
it
society
itself
that
forces
us
to
use
these
underhanded
means
what
would
have
happened
if
i
had
not
acted
secretly
everybody
would
have
wanted
to
have
a
hand
in
the
undertaking
the
whole
thing
would
have
been
divided
up
mismanaged
and
bungled
there
is
not
a
single
man
in
the
town
except
myself
who
is
capable
of
directing
so
big
an
affair
as
this
will
be
in
this
country
almost
without
exception
it
is
only
foreigners
who
have
settled
here
who
have
the
aptitude
for
big
business
schemes
that
is
the
reason
why
my
conscience
acquits
me
in
the
matter
it
is
only
in
my
hands
that
these
properties
can
become
a
real
blessing
to
the
many
who
have
to
make
their
daily
bread
lona
i
believe
you
are
right
there
karsten
johan
but
i
have
no
concern
with
the
many
and
my
life
happiness
is
at
stake
bernick
the
welfare
of
your
native
place
is
also
at
stake
if
things
come
out
which
cast
reflections
on
my
earlier
conduct
then
all
my
opponents
will
fall
upon
me
with
united
vigour
a
youthful
folly
is
never
allowed
to
be
forgotten
in
our
community
they
would
go
through
the
whole
of
my
previous
life
bring
up
a
thousand
little
incidents
in
it
interpret
and
explain
them
in
the
light
of
what
has
been
revealed
they
would
crush
me
under
the
weight
of
rumours
and
slanders
i
should
be
obliged
to
abandon
the
railway
scheme
and
if
i
take
my
hand
off
that
it
will
come
to
nothing
and
i
shall
be
ruined
and
my
life
as
a
citizen
will
be
over
lona
johan
after
what
we
have
just
heard
you
must
go
away
from
here
and
hold
your
tongue
bernick
yes
yes
johan
you
must
johan
yes
i
will
go
away
and
i
will
hold

shall
speak

over
there

your
tongue
and
i
am
willing
to
share
with
you

keep
your
money
but
give
me
back
my
name
and
reputation
bernick
and
sacrifice
my
own
johan

and
your
community
must
get
out
of
that
the
best
way
you
can

must

my
wife

therefore
i
am
going
to

promised

and
set
my
affairs
in
order
in
two
months
i
shall
be
back

and
then
you
will
speak

then
the
guilty
man
must
take
his
guilt
on
himself
bernick
have
you
forgotten
that
if
i
do
that
i
must
also
take
on
myself
guilt
that
is
not
mine
johan
who
is
it
that
for
the
last
fifteen
years
has
benefited
by
that
shameful
rumour
bernick
you
will
drive
me
to
desperation
well
if
you
speak

shall
deny

shall
say

is
a
plot
against

come
here
to
blackmail

box
among

are
plain
enough

and
will
you
make
them
public

it
becomes
necessary

and
you
will
be
back

months

new
york
if
the
indian
girl
does
not
go
to
the
bottom

with
a
start
go
to
the
bottom
why
should
the
indian
girl
go
to
the
bottom

so
why
should
she
bernick
scarcely
audibly
go
to
the
bottom
johan

not
treated
me
like
a
sister

you
must
prevent
that
lona
you
see
for
yourself
karsten
i
have
no
influence
over
him
any
longer
follows
johan
into
the
other
room
bernick
a
prey
to
uneasy
thoughts
go
to
the
bottom
aune
comes
in
from
the
right
aune
excuse
me
sir
but
if
it
is
convenient
bernick
turning
round
angrily
what
do
you
want
aune
to
know
if
i
may
ask
you
a
question
sir
bernick
be
quick
about
it
then
what
is
it
aune
i
wanted
to
ask
if
i
am
to
consider
it
as
certain
absolutely
certain
that
i
should
be
dismissed
from
the
yard
if
the
indian
girl
were
not
ready
to
sail
tomorrow
bernick
what
do
you
mean
the
ship
is
ready
to
sail
aune
yes
it
is
but
suppose
it
were
not
should
i
be
discharged
bernick
what
is
the
use
of
asking
such
idle
questions
aune
only
that
i
should
like
to
know
sir
will
you
answer
me
that
should
i
be
discharged
bernick
am
i
in
the
habit
of
keeping
my
word
or
not
aune
then
tomorrow
i
should
have
lost
the
position
i
hold
in
my
house
and
among
those
near
and
dear
to
me
lost
my
influence
over
men
of
my
own
class
lost
all
opportunity
of
doing
anything
for
the
cause
of
the
poorer
and
needier
members
of
the
community
bernick
aune
we
have
discussed
all
that
before
aune
quite
so
then
the
indian
girl
will
sail
a
short
silence
bernick
look
here
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
have
my
eyes
everywhere
i
can
not
be
answerable
for
everything
you
can
give
me
your
assurance
i
suppose
that
the
repairs
have
been
satisfactorily
carried
out
aune
you
gave
me
very
short
grace
bernick
bernick
but
i
understand
you
to
warrant
the
repairs
aune
the
weather
is
fine
and
it
is
summer
another
pause
bernick
have
you
anything
else
to
say
to
me
aune
i
think
not
sir
bernick
then
the
indian
girl
will
sail
aune
tomorrow
bernick
yes
aune
very
good
bows
and
goes
out
bernick
stands
for
a
moment
irresolute
then
walks
quickly
towards
the
door
as
if
to
call
aune
back
but
stops
hesitatingly
with
his
hand
on
the
at
that
moment
the
door
is
opened
from
without
and
krap
comes
in
krap
in
a
low
voice
aha
he
has
been
here
has
he
confessed
bernick
hm
have
you
discovered
anything
krap
what
need
of
that
sir
could
you
not
see
the
evil
conscience
looking
out
of
the
man
eyes
bernick
nonsense
such
things
do
show
have
you
discovered
anything
i
want
to
know
krap
i
could
not
manage
it
i
was
too
late
they
had
already
begun
hauling
the
ship
out
of
the
dock
but
their
very
haste
in
doing
that
plainly
shows
that
bernick
it
shows
nothing
has
the
inspection
taken
place
then
krap
of
course
but
bernick
there
you
see
and
of
course
they
found
nothing
to
complain
of
krap
bernick
you
know
very
well
how
much
this
inspection
means
especially
in
a
yard
that
has
such
a
good
name
as
ours
has
bernick
no
matter
it
takes
all
responsibility
off
us
krap
but
sir
could
you
really
not
tell
from
aune
manner
that
bernick
aune
has
completely
reassured
me
let
me
tell
you
krap
and
let
me
tell
you
sir
that
i
am
morally
certain
that
bernick
what
does
this
mean
krap
i
see
plainly
enough
that
you
want
to
get
your
knife
into
this
man
but
if
you
want
to
attack
him
you
must
find
some
other
occasion
you
know
how
important
it
is
to
me
or
i
should
say
to
the
owners
that
the
indian
girl
should
sail
krap
very
well
so
be
it
but
if
ever
we
hear
of
that
ship
again
hm
vigeland
comes
in
from
the
right
vigeland
i
wish
you
a
very
good
morning
bernick
have
you
a
moment
to
spare
bernick
at
your
service
vigeland
vigeland
i
only
want
to
know
if
you
are
also
of
opinion
that
the
palm
tree
should
sail
tomorrow
bernick
certainly
i
thought
that
was
quite
settled
vigeland
well
the
captain
came
to
me
just
now
and
told
me
that
storm
signals
have
been
hoisted
bernick
oh
are
we
to
expect
a
storm
vigeland
a
stiff
breeze
at
all
events
but
not
a
contrary
wind
just
the
opposite
bernick
hm
well
what
do
you
say
vigeland
i
say
as
i
said
to
the
captain
that
the
palm
tree
is
in
the
hands
of
providence
besides
they
are
only
going
across
the
north
sea
at
first
and
in
england
freights
are
running
tolerably
high
just
now
so
that
bernick
yes
it
would
probably
mean
a
loss
for
us
if
we
waited
vigeland
besides
she
is
a
stout
ship
and
fully
insured
as
well
it
is
more
risky
now
for
the
indian
girl
bernick
what
do
you
mean
vigeland
she
sails
tomorrow
too
bernick
yes
the
owners
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
and
besides
vigeland
well
if
that
old
hulk
can
venture
out
and
with
such
a
crew
into
the
bargain
it
would
be
a
disgrace
to
us
if
we
bernick
quite
so
i
presume
you
have
the
ship
papers
with
you
vigeland
yes
here
they
are
bernick
good
then
will
you
go
in
with
krap
krap
will
you
come
in
here
sir
and
we
will
dispose
of
them
at
once
vigeland
thank
and
the
issue
we
leave
in
the
hands
of
the
almighty
bernick
goes
with
krap
into
bernick
room
rorlund
comes
up
from
the
garden
rorlund
at
home
at
this
time
of
day
bernick
bernick
lost
in
thought
as
you
see
rorlund
it
was
really
on
your
wife
account
i
came
i
thought
she
might
be
in
need
of
a
word
of
comfort
bernick
very
likely
she
is
but
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
too
rorlund
with
the
greatest
of
pleasure
bernick
but
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
look
quite
pale
and
upset
bernick
really
do
i
well
what
else
could
you
expect
a
man
so
loaded
with
responsibilities
as
i
am
there
is
all
my
own
big
business
and
now
the
planning
of
this
but
tell
me
something
rorlund
let
me
put
a
question
to
you
rorlund
with
pleasure
bernick
bernick
it
is
about
a
thought
that
has
occurred
to
me
suppose
a
man
is
face
to
face
with
an
undertaking
which
will
concern
the
welfare
of
thousands
and
suppose
it
should
be
necessary
to
make
a
sacrifice
of
one
rorlund
what
do
you
mean
bernick
for
example
suppose
a
man
were
thinking
of
starting
a
large
factory
he
knows
for
certain
because
all
his
experience
has
taught
him
so
that
sooner
or
later
a
toll
of
human
life
will
be
exacted
in
the
working
of
that
factory
rorlund
yes
that
is
only
too
probable
bernick
or
say
a
man
embarks
on
a
mining
enterprise
he
takes
into
his
service
fathers
of
families
and
young
men
in
the
first
flush
of
their
youth
is
it
not
quite
safe
to
predict
that
all
of
them
will
not
come
out
of
it
alive
rorlund
yes
unhappily
that
is
quite
true
bernick
well
a
man
in
that
position
will
know
beforehand
that
the
undertaking
he
proposes
to
start
must
undoubtedly
at
some
time
or
other
mean
a
loss
of
human
life
but
the
undertaking
itself
is
for
the
public
good
for
every
man
life
that
it
costs
it
will
undoubtedly
promote
the
welfare
of
many
hundreds
rorlund
ah
you
are
thinking
of
the
railway
of
all
the
dangerous
excavating
and
blasting
and
that
sort
of
thing
bernick
yes
quite
so
i
am
thinking
of
the
railway
and
besides
the
coming
of
the
railway
will
mean
the
starting
of
factories
and
mines
but
do
not
think
nevertheless
rorlund
my
dear
bernick
you
are
almost
what
i
think
is
that
if
you
place
the
affair
in
the
hands
of
providence
bernick
yes
exactly
providence
rorlund
you
are
blameless
in
the
matter
go
on
and
build
your
railway
hopefully
bernick
yes
but
now
i
will
put
a
special
instance
to
you
suppose
a
charge
of
had
to
be
exploded
in
a
dangerous
place
and
that
unless
it
were
exploded
the
line
could
not
be
constructed
suppose
the
engineer
knew
that
it
would
cost
the
life
of
the
workman
who
lit
the
fuse
but
that
it
had
to
be
lit
and
that
it
was
the
duty
to
send
a
workman
to
do
it
rorlund
hm
bernick
i
know
what
you
will
say
it
would
be
a
splendid
thing
if
the
engineer
took
the
match
himself
and
went
and
lit
the
fuse
but
that
is
out
of
the
question
so
he
must
sacrifice
a
workman
rorlund
that
is
a
thing
no
engineer
here
would
ever
do
bernick
no
engineer
in
the
bigger
countries
would
think
twice
about
doing
it
rorlund
in
the
bigger
countries
no
i
can
quite
believe
it
in
those
depraved
and
unprincipled
communities
bernick
oh
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
those
communities
rorlund
can
you
say
that
you
who
yourself
bernick
in
the
bigger
communities
a
man
finds
space
to
carry
out
a
valuable
project
finds
the
courage
to
make
some
sacrifice
in
a
great
cause
but
here
a
man
is
cramped
by
all
kinds
of
petty
considerations
and
scruples
rorlund
is
human
life
a
petty
consideration
bernick
when
that
human
life
threatens
the
welfare
of
thousands
rorlund
but
you
are
suggesting
cases
that
are
quite
inconceivable
bernick
i
do
not
understand
you
at
all
today
and
you
quote
the
bigger
countries
well
what
do
they
think
of
human
life
there
they
look
upon
it
simply
as
part
of
the
capital
they
have
to
use
but
we
look
at
things
from
a
somewhat
different
moral
standpoint
i
should
hope
look
at
our
respected
shipping
industry
can
you
name
a
single
one
of
our
who
would
sacrifice
a
human
life
for
the
sake
of
paltry
gain
and
then
think
of
those
scoundrels
in
the
bigger
countries
who
for
the
sake
of
profit
send
out
freights
in
one
unseaworthy
ship
after
another
bernick
i
am
not
talking
of
unseaworthy
ships
rorlund
but
i
am
bernick
bernick
yes
but
to
what
purpose
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
oh
these
small
timid
considerations
if
a
general
from
this
country
were
to
take
his
men
under
fire
and
some
of
them
were
shot
i
suppose
he
would
have
sleepless
nights
after
it
it
is
not
so
in
other
countries
you
should
bear
what
that
fellow
in
there
says
rorlund
he
who
the
american
bernick
yes
you
should
hear
how
in
america
rorlund
he
in
there
and
you
did
not
tell
me
i
shall
at
once
bernick
it
is
no
use
you
wo
be
able
to
do
anything
with
him
rorlund
we
shall
see
ah
here
he
comes
johan
comes
in
from
the
other
room
johan
talking
back
through
the
open
door
yes
yes
dina
as
you
please
but
i
do
not
mean
to
give
you
up
all
the
same
i
shall
come
back
and
then
everything
will
come
right
between
us
rorlund
excuse
me
but
what
did
you
mean
by
that
what
is
it
you
propose
to
do
johan
i
propose
that
that
young
girl
before
whom
you
blackened
my
character
yesterday
shall
become
my
wife
rorlund
your
wife
and
can
you
really
suppose
that
johan
i
mean
to
marry
her
rorlund
well
then
you
shall
know
the
truth
goes
to
the
door
bernick
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
come
and
be
a
witness
and
you
too
miss
martha
and
let
dina
come
sees
lona
at
the
door
ah
you
here
too
lona
shall
i
come
too
rorlund
as
many
as
you
please
the
more
the
better
bernick
what
are
you
going
to
do
lona
bernick
martha
dina
and
hilmar
come
in
from
the
other
room
bernick
rorlund
i
have
tried
my
hardest
but
i
can
not
prevent
him
rorlund
i
shall
prevent
him
bernick
dina
you
are
a
thoughtless
girl
but
i
do
not
blame
you
so
greatly
you
have
too
long
lacked
the
necessary
moral
support
that
should
have
sustained
you
i
blame
myself
for
not
having
afforded
you
that
support
dina
you
must
speak
now
bernick
what
is
it
rorlund
it
is
now
that
i
must
speak
dina
although
your
conduct
yesterday
and
today
has
made
it
ten
times
more
difficult
for
me
but
all
other
considerations
must
give
way
to
the
necessity
for
saving
you
you
remember
that
i
gave
you
my
word
you
remember
what
you
promised
you
would
answer
when
i
judged
that
the
right
time
had
come
now
i
dare
not
hesitate
any
longer
and
therefore
turns
to
johan
this
young
girl
whom
you
are
persecuting
is
my
betrothed
bernick
what
bernick
dina
johan
she
your
martha
no
no
dina
lona
it
is
a
lie
johan
dina
is
this
man
speaking
the
truth
dina
after
a
short
pause
yes
rorlund
i
hope
this
has
rendered
all
your
arts
of
seduction
powerless
the
step
i
have
determined
to
take
for
dina
good
i
now
wish
openly
proclaimed
to
every
one
i
cherish
the
certain
hope
that
it
will
not
be
misinterpreted
and
now
bernick
i
think
it
will
be
best
for
us
to
take
her
away
from
here
and
try
to
bring
back
peace
and
tranquillity
to
her
mind
bernick
yes
come
with
me

a
lucky

taken
away
it
is
a
stormy
evening
and
already
dusk
darkness
sets
in
as
the
following
scene
is
in
progress
a
is
lighting
the
chandelier
two
maids
bring
in
pots
of
flowers
lamps
and
candles
which
they
place
on
tables
and
stands
along
the
walls
rummel
in
dress
clothes
with
gloves
and
a
white
tie
is
standing
in
the
room
giving
instructions
to
the
servants
rummel
only
every
other
candle
jacob
it
must
not
look
as
if
it
were
arranged
for
the
occasion
it
has
to
come
as
a
surprise
you
know
and
all
these
flowers
oh
well
let
them
be
it
will
probably
look
as
if
they
stood
there
everyday
bernick
comes
out
of
his
room
bernick
stopping
at
the
door
what
does
this
mean
rummel
oh
dear
is
it
you
to
the
servants
yes
you
might
leave
us
for
the
present
the
servants
go
out
bernick
but
rummel
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
rummel
it
means
that
the
proudest
moment
of
your
life
has
come
a
procession
of
his
fellow
citizens
is
coming
to
do
honour
to
the
first
man
of
the
town
bernick
what
rummel
in
procession
with
banners
and
a
band
we
ought
to
have
had
torches
too
but
we
did
not
like
to
risk
that
in
this
stormy
weather
there
will
be
illuminations
and
that
always
sounds
well
in
the
newspapers
bernick
listen
rummel
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
this
rummel
but
it
is
too
late
now
they
will
be
here
in
bernick
but
why
did
you
not
tell
me
about
this
before
rummel
just
because
i
was
afraid
you
would
raise
objections
to
it
but
i
consulted
your
wife
she
allowed
me
to
take
charge
of
the
arrangements
while
she
looks
after
the
refreshments
bernick
listening
what
is
that
noise
are
they
coming
already
i
fancy
i
hear
singing
rummel
going
to
the
verandah
door
singing
oh
that
is
only
the
americans
the
indian
girl
is
being
towed
out
bernick
towed
out
oh
yes
no
rummel
i
can
not
this
evening
i
am
not
well
rummel
you
certainly
do
look
bad
but
you
must
pull
yourself
together
devil
take
it
you
must
sandstad
and
vigeland
and
i
all
attach
the
greatest
importance
to
carrying
this
thing
through
we
have
got
to
crush
our
opponents
under
the
weight
of
as
complete
an
expression
of
public
opinion
as
possible
rumours
are
getting
about
the
town
our
announcement
about
the
purchase
of
the
property
can
not
be
withheld
any
longer
it
is
imperative
that
this
very
evening
after
songs
and
speeches
amidst
the
clink
of
glasses
in
a
word
in
an
ebullient
atmosphere
of
festivity
you
should
inform
them
of
the
risk
you
have
incurred
for
the
good
of
the
community
in
such
an
ebullient
atmosphere
of
festivity
as
i
just
now
described
it
you
can
do
an
astonishing
lot
with
the
people
here
but
you
must
have
that
atmosphere
or
the
thing
wo
go
bernick
yes
yes
rummel
and
especially
when
so
delicate
and
ticklish
a
point
has
to
be
negotiated
well
thank
goodness
you
have
a
name
that
will
be
a
tower
of
strength
bernick
but
listen
now
we
must
make
our
arrangements
to
some
extent
hilmar
tonnesen
has
written
an
ode
to
you
it
begins
very
charmingly
with
the
words
raise
the
ideal
banner
high
and
rorlund
has
undertaken
the
task
of
making
the
speech
of
the
evening
of
course
you
must
reply
to
that
bernick
i
can
not
tonight
rummel
could
you
rummel
it
is
impossible
however
willing
i
might
be
because
as
you
can
imagine
his
speech
will
be
especially
addressed
to
you
of
course
it
is
possible
he
may
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
rest
of
us
i
have
spoken
to
vigeland
and
sandstad
about
it
our
idea
is
that
in
replying
you
should
propose
the
toast
of
prosperity
to
our
community
sandstad
will
say
a
few
words
on
the
subject
of
harmonious
relations
between
the
different
strata
of
society
then
vigeland
will
express
the
hope
that
this
new
undertaking
may
not
disturb
the
sound
moral
basis
upon
which
our
community
stands
and
i
propose
in
a
few
suitable
words
to
refer
to
the
ladies
whose
work
for
the
community
though
more
inconspicuous
is
far
from
being
without
its
importance
but
you
are
not
listening
to
me
bernick
yes
indeed
i
am
but
tell
me
do
you
think
there
is
a
very
heavy
sea
running
outside
rummel

are
you
nervous
about
the
palm
tree

is
fully
insured

know
bernick

insured

that
human
life

be
in
danger

sparkling
sunshine

homage
of
his
fellow
citizens
as
one
of
the
pillars
of
society
bernick
that
is
so
and
they
will
begin
to
cheer
outside
and
the
crowd
will
shout
in
front
of
my
house

thank

do
suppose

feel
so
very
happy
bernick
lona
you
despise
me
lona
not
yet
bernick
and
you
have
no
right
to
no
right
to
despise
me
lona
you
can
have
no
idea
how
utterly
alone
i
stand
in
this
cramped
and
stunted
community
where
i
have
had
year
after
year
to
stifle
my
ambition
for
a
fuller
life
my
work
may
seem
but
what
have
i
really
accomplished
odds
and
ends
scraps
they
would
not
stand
anything
else
here
if
i
were
to
go
a
step
in
advance
of
the
opinions
and
views
that
are
current
at
the
moment
i
should
lose
all
my
influence
do
you
know
what
we
are
we
who
are
looked
upon
as
pillars
of
society
we
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
tools
of
society
lona
why
have
you
only
begun
to
realise
that
now
bernick
because
i
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
lately
since
you
came
back
and
this
evening
i
have
thought
more
seriously
than
ever
before
oh
lona
why
did
not
i
really
know
you
then
in
the
old
days
i
mean
lona
and
if
you
had
bernick
i
should
never
have
let
you
go
and
if
i
had
had
you
i
should
not
be
in
the
position
i
am
in
tonight
lona
and
do
you
never
consider
what
she
might
have
been
to
you
she
whom
you
chose
in
my
place
bernick
i
know
at
all
events
that
she
has
been
nothing
to
me
of
what
i
needed
lona
because
you
have
never
shared
your
interests
with
her
because
you
have
never
allowed
her
full
and
frank
exchange
of
thoughts
with
you
because
you
have
allowed
her
to
be
borne
under
by
for
the
shame
you
cast
upon
one
who
was
dear
to
her
bernick
yes
yes
it
all
comes
from
lying
and
deceit
lona
then
why
not
break
with
all
this
lying
and
deceit
bernick
now
it
is
too
late
now
lona
lona
karsten
tell
me
what
gratification
does
all
this
show
and
deception
bring
you
bernick
it
brings
me
none
i
must
disappear
someday
and
all
this
community
of
bunglers
with
me
but
a
generation
is
growing
up
that
will
follow
us
it
is
my
son
that
i
work
for
i
am
providing
a
career
for
him
there
will
come
a
time
when
truth
will
enter
into
the
life
of
the
community
and
on
that
foundation
he
shall
build
up
a
happier
existence
than
his
father
lona
with
a
lie
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
consider
what
sort
of
an
inheritance
it
is
that
you
are
leaving
to
your
son
bernick
in
tones
of
suppressed
despair
it
is
a
thousand
times
worse
than
you
think
but
surely
some
day
the
curse
must
be
lifted
and
yet
nevertheless
vehemently
how
could
i
bring
all
this
upon
my
own
head
still
it
is
done
now
i
must
go
on
with
it
now
you
shall
not
succeed
in
crushing
me
hilmar
comes
in
hurriedly
and
agitatedly
from
the
right
with
an
open
letter

lona
karsten

about
our
having
come
here

crush
you

me
tell

sort
of
stuff
this
prodigal
son
whom
your
moral
community
shuns
as

the
plague

made
of
he
can
do
without

of
you

followed
by
townspeople

as
many
as

get
into
the

an
apparently
endless
crowd
of
people
waving

the
street
rorlund
bernick

surprise
depicted
upon

as
unexpected
guests

are
intruding
upon
your
happy
family
circle
and
your
peaceful
fireside
where
we
find
you
surrounded
by
honoured
and
energetic
fellow
citizens
and
friends
but
it
is
our
hearts
that
have
bidden
us
come
to
offer
you
our
homage
not
for
the
first
time
it
is
true
but
for
the
first
time
on
such
a
comprehensive
scale
we
have
on
many
occasions
given
you
our
thanks
for
the
broad
moral
foundation
upon
which
you
have
so
to
speak
reared
the
edifice
of
our
community
on
this
occasion
we
offer
our
homage
especially
to
the
indefatigable
unselfish
nay
citizen
who
has
taken
the
initiative
in
an
undertaking
which
we
are
assured
on
all
sides
will
give
a
powerful
impetus
to
the
temporal
prosperity
and
welfare
of
our
community
voices
bravo
bravo
rorlund
you
sir
have
for
many
years
been
a
shining
example
in
our
midst
this
is
not
the
place
for
me
to
speak
of
your
family
life
which
has
been
a
model
to
us
all
still
less
to
enlarge
upon
your
unblemished
personal
character
such
topics
belong
to
the
stillness
of
a
man
own
chamber
not
to
a
festal
occasion
such
as
this
i
am
here
to
speak
of
your
public
life
as
a
citizen
as
it
lies
open
to
all
men
eyes
vessels
sail
away
from
your
shipyard
and
carry
our
flag
far
and
wide
over
the
seas
a
numerous
and
happy
band
of
workmen
look
up
to
you
as
to
a
father
by
calling
new
branches
of
industry
into
existence
you
have
laid
the
foundations
of
the
welfare
of
hundreds
of
families
in
a
word
you
are
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
term
the
mainstay
of
our
community
voices
hear
hear
bravo
rorlund
and
sir
it
is
just
that
disinterestedness
which
colours
all
your
conduct
that
is
so
beneficial
to
our
community
more
so
than
words
can
express
and
especially
at
the
present
moment
you
are
now
on
the
point
of
procuring
for
us
what
i
have
no
hesitation
in
calling
bluntly
by
its
prosaic
name
a
railway
voices
bravo
bravo
rorlund
but
it
would
seem
as
though
the
undertaking
were
beset
by
certain
difficulties
the
outcome
of
narrow
and
selfish
considerations
voices
hear
hear
rorlund
for
the
fact
has
come
to
light
that
certain
individuals
who
do
not
belong
to
our
community
have
stolen
a
march
upon
the
citizens
of
this
place
and
have
laid
hands
on
certain
sources
of
profit
which
by
rights
should
have
fallen
to
the
share
of
our
town
voices
that
right
hear
hear
rorlund
this
regrettable
fact
has
naturally
come
to
your
knowledge
also
bernick
but
it
has
not
had
the
slightest
effect
in
deterring
you
from
proceeding
steadily
with
your
project
well
knowing
that
a
patriotic
man
should
not
solely
take
local
interests
into
consideration
voices
oh
no
no
yes
yes
rorlund
it
is
to
such
a
man
to
the
patriot
citizen
whose
character
we
all
should
emulate
that
we
bring
our
homage
this
evening
may
your
undertaking
grow
to
be
a
real
and
lasting
source
of
good
fortune
to
this
community
it
is
true
enough
that
a
railway
may
be
the
means
of
our
exposing
ourselves
to
the
incursion
of
pernicious
influences
from
without
but
it
gives
us
also
the
means
of
quickly
expelling
them
from
within
for
even
we
at
the
present
time
can
not
boast
of
being
entirely
free
from
the
danger
of
such
outside
influences
but
as
we
have
on
this
very
evening
if
rumour
is
to
be
believed
fortunately
got
rid
of
certain
elements
of
that
nature
sooner
than
was
to
be
expected
voices
order
order
rorlund
i
regard
the
occurrence
as
a
happy
omen
for
our
undertaking
my
alluding
to
such
a
thing
at
such
a
moment
only
emphasises
the
fact
that
the
house
in
which
we
are
now
standing
is
one
where
the
claims
of
morality
are
esteemed
even
above
ties
of
family
voices
hear
hear
bravo
bernick
at
the
same
moment
allow
me
rorlund
i
have
only
a
few
more
words
to
say
bernick
what
you
have
done
for
your
native
place
we
all
know
has
not
been
done
with
any
underlying
idea
of
its
bringing
tangible
profit
to
yourself
but
nevertheless
you
must
not
refuse
to
accept
a
slight
token
of
grateful
appreciation
at
the
hands
of
your
least
of
all
at
this
important
moment
when
according
to
the
assurances
of
practical
men
we
are
standing
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
era
voices
bravo
hear
hear
rorlund
signs
to
the
servants
who
bring
forward
the
basket
during
the
following
speech
members
of
the
committee
take
out
and
present
the
various
objects
mentioned
rorlund
and
so
bernick
we
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
you
with
this
silver
let
it
grace
your
board
when
in
the
future
as
so
often
in
the
past
we
have
the
happiness
of
being
assembled
under
your
hospitable
roof
you
too
gentlemen
who
have
so
generously
seconded
the
leader
of
our
community
we
ask
to
accept
a
small
souvenir
this
silver
goblet
is
for
you
rummel
many
a
time
have
you
amidst
the
clink
of
glasses
defended
the
interests
of
your
in
words
may
you
often
find
similar
worthy
opportunities
to
raise
and
empty
this
goblet
in
some
patriotic
toast
to
you
sandstad
i
present
this
album
containing
photographs
of
your
your
and
conspicuous
liberality
has
put
you
in
the
pleasant
position
of
being
able
to
number
your
friends
amongst
all
classes
of
society
and
to
you
vigeland
i
have
to
offer
this
book
of
family
devotions
printed
on
vellum
and
handsomely
bound
to
grace
your
study
table
the
mellowing
influence
of
time
has
led
you
to
take
an
earnest
view
of
life
your
zeal
in
carrying
out
your
daily
duties
has
for
a
long
period
of
years
been
purified
and
enobled
by
thoughts
of
higher
and
holier
things
turns
to
the
crowd
and
now
friends
three
cheers
for
bernick
and
his
three
cheers
for
the
pillars
of
our
society
the
whole
crowd
bernick
pillars
of
society
lona
i
congratulate
you
an
expectant
hush
follows
bernick
speaking
seriously
and
slowly
fellow
citizens
your
spokesman
said
just
now
that
tonight
we
are
standing
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
era
i
hope
that
will
prove
to
be
the
case
but
before
that
can
come
to
pass
we
must
lay
fast
hold
of
truth
truth
which
till
tonight
has
been
altogether
and
in
all
circumstances
a
stranger
to
this
community
of
ours
astonishment
among
the
audience
to
that
end
i
must
begin
by
deprecating
the
praises
with
which
you
rorlund
according
to
custom
on
such
occasions
have
overwhelmed
me
i
do
not
deserve
them
because
until
today
my
actions
have
by
no
means
been
disinterested
even
though
i
may
not
always
have
aimed
at
pecuniary
profit
i
at
all
events
recognise
now
that
a
craving
for
power
influence
and
position
has
been
the
moving
spirit
of
most
of
my
actions
rummel
half
aloud
what
next
bernick
standing
before
my
fellow
citizens
i
do
not
reproach
myself
for
that
because
i
still
think
i
am
entitled
to
a
place
in
the
front
rank
of
our
capable
men
of
affairs
voices
yes
yes
yes
bernick
but
what
i
charge
myself
with
is
that
i
have
so
often
been
weak
enough
to
resort
to
deceitfulness
because
i
knew
and
feared
the
tendency
of
the
community
to
espy
unclean
motives
behind
everything
a
prominent
man
here
undertakes
and
now
i
am
coming
to
a
point
which
will
illustrate
that
rummel
uneasily
bernick
there
have
been
rumours
of
extensive
purchases
of
property
outside
the
town
these
purchases
have
been
made
by
me
by
me
alone
and
by
no
one
else
murmurs
are
heard
what
does
he
say
he
bernick
the
properties
are
for
the
time
being
in
my
hands
naturally
i
have
confided
in
my
rummel
vigeland
and
sandstad
and
we
are
all
agreed
that
rummel
it
is
not
true
prove
it
prove
it
vigeland
we
are
not
all
agreed
about
anything
sandstad
well
really
i
must
say
bernick
that
is
quite
true
we
are
not
yet
agreed
upon
the
matter
i
was
going
to
mention
but
i
confidently
hope
that
these
three
gentlemen
will
agree
with
me
when
i
announce
to
you
that
i
have
tonight
come
to
the
decision
that
these
properties
shall
be
exploited
as
a
company
of
which
the
shares
shall
be
offered
for
public
subscription
any
one
that
wishes
can
take
shares
voices
hurrah
three
cheers
for
bernick
rummel
in
a
low
voice
to
bernick
this
is
the
basest
treachery
sandstad
also
in
an
undertone
so
you
have
been
fooling
us
vigeland
well
then
devil
take
good
lord
what
am
i
saying
cheers
are
heard
without
bernick
silence
gentlemen
i
have
no
right
to
this
homage
you
offer
me
because
the
decision
i
have
just
come
to
does
not
represent
what
was
my
first
intention
my
intention
was
to
keep
the
whole
thing
for
myself
and
even
now
i
am
of
opinion
that
these
properties
would
be
worked
to
best
advantage
if
they
remained
in
one
man
hands
but
you
are
at
liberty
to
choose
if
you
wish
it
i
am
willing
to
administer
them
to
the
best
of
my
abilities
voices
yes
yes
yes
bernick
but
first
of
all
my
fellow
townsmen
must
know
me
thoroughly
and
let
each
man
seek
to
know
himself
thoroughly
too
and
so
let
it
really
come
to
pass
that
tonight
we
begin
a
new
era
the
old
era
with
its
affectation
its
hypocrisy
and
its
emptiness
its
pretence
of
virtue
and
its
miserable
fear
of
public
opinion
shall
be
for
us
like
a
museum
open
for
purposes
of
instruction
and
to
that
museum
we
will
present
shall
we
not
gentlemen
the
coffee
service
and
the
goblet
and
the
album
and
the
family
devotions
printed
on
vellum
and
handsomely
bound
rummel
oh
of
course
vigeland
muttering
if
you
have
taken
everything
else
then
sandstad
by
all
means
bernick
and
now
for
the
principal
reckoning
i
have
to
make
with
the
community
rorlund
said
that
certain
pernicious
elements
had
left
us
this
evening
i
can
add
what
you
do
not
yet
know
the
man
referred
to
did
not
go
away
alone
with
him
to
become
his
wife
went
lona
loudly
dina
dorf
rorlund
what
bernick
what
great
commotion
rorlund
fled
run
away
with
him
impossible
bernick
to
become
his
wife
rorlund
and
i
will
add
more
in
a
low
voice
to
his
wife
betty
be
strong
to
bear
what
is
coming
aloud
this
is
what
i
have
to
say
hats
off
to
that
man
for
he
has
nobly
taken
another
guilt
upon
his
shoulders
my
friends
i
want
to
have
done
with
falsehood
it
has
very
nearly
poisoned
every
fibre
of
my
being
you
shall
know
all
fifteen
years
ago
i
was
the
guilty
man
bernick
softly
and
tremblingly
karsten
martha
similarly
ah
johan
lona
now
at
last
you
have
found
yourself
speechless
consternation
among
the
audience
bernick
yes
friends
i
was
the
guilty
one
and
he
went
away
the
vile
and
lying
rumours
that
were
spread
abroad
afterwards
it
is
beyond
human
power
to
refute
now
but
i
have
no
right
to
complain
of
that
for
fifteen
years
i
have
climbed
up
the
ladder
of
success
by
the
help
of
those
rumours
whether
now
they
are
to
cast
me
down
again
or
not
each
of
you
must
decide
in
his
own
mind
rorlund
what
a
thunderbolt
our
leading
citizen
in
a
low
voice
to
betty
how
sorry
i
am
for
you
bernick
hilmar
what
a
confession
well
i
must
say
bernick
but
come
to
no
decision
tonight
i
entreat
every
one
to
go
home
to
collect
his
thoughts
to
look
into
his
own
heart
when
once
more
you
can
think
calmly
then
it
will
be
seen
whether
i
have
lost
or
won
by
speaking
out
goodbye
i
have
still
much
very
much
to
repent
of
but
that
concerns
my
own
conscience
only
good
night
take
away
all
these
signs
of
rejoicing
we
must
all
feel
that
they
are
out
of
place
here
rorlund
that
they
certainly
are
in
an
undertone
to
mrs
bernick
run
away
so
then
she
was
completely
unworthy
of
me
louder
to
the
committee
yes
gentlemen
after
this
i
think
we
had
better
disperse
as
quietly
as
possible
hilmar
how
after
this
any
one
is
to
manage
to
hold
the
banner
high
ugh
meantime
the
news
has
been
whispered
from
mouth
to
mouth
the
crowd
gradually
disperses
from
the
garden
rummel
sandstad
and
vigeland
go
out
arguing
eagerly
but
in
a
low
voice
hilmar
slinks
away
to
the
right
when
silence
is
restored
there
only
remain
in
the
room
bernick
bernick
martha
lona
and
krap
bernick
betty
can
you
forgive
me
bernick
looking
at
him
with
a
smile

you
know
karsten
that
you
have
opened
out
for
me
the
happiest
prospect
i
have
had
for
many
a
year
bernick
how
bernick
for
many
years
i
have
felt
that
once
you
were
mine
and
that
i
had
lost
you
now
i
know
that
you
never
have
been
mine
yet

in
his
arms

to
me
bernick

have
him
now
krap
talks
softly
to
krap
in
the
background
he
goes
out
by
the
garden
door
during
what
follows
the
illuminations
and
lights
in
the
houses
are
gradually
extinguished
bernick
in
a
low
voice
thank
you
lona
you
have
saved
what
was
best
in
me
and
for
me
lona
do

suppose

wanted

that
so
or
not
i
can
not
quite
make
you
out
lona
hm

it
was
not
hatred

you
come
back

lona
old
friendship

not
rust
bernick
lona
lona
when
johan

my
youth

wretch
